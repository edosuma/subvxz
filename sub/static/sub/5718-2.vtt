WEBVTT

00:04.772 --> 00:06.474
Allison! Big D!

00:06.540 --> 00:07.941
(WHOOPING)

00:08.008 --> 00:10.411
Shh! Reading.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.313
Okay, buzz killed.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.015
Time of death, 7:31.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.317
Where's Molly?

00:16.384 --> 00:17.818
At a party.

00:17.885 --> 00:21.355
A party on a weeknight?
What is she, a rapper?

00:21.422 --> 00:24.258
What you reading
there, animal?
One of those Nancy Drews?

00:24.325 --> 00:27.528
No, Ken.
Though happy 80th birthday
to that reference.

00:27.595 --> 00:31.465
Our son is reading a biography
of German chancellor
Angela Merkel.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.335
Oh, Angela.
Didn't see that coming.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.870
Oh, no, she didn't!

00:36.937 --> 00:38.306
He's turning out weird.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.609
So, the Merkster.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.377
Merkelangelo.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.546
I'm familiar.
Teutonic gal.

00:45.613 --> 00:46.847
Kind of looks
like Paul McCartney.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.616
Please.
She doesn't look like...

00:50.351 --> 00:52.720
Oh, yeah,
that is Paul.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.389
Hey, buddy.
Why don't you slap
a bookmark in that brick,

00:55.456 --> 00:57.091
and we'll go hit
Saddle Burger.

00:57.158 --> 01:00.194
They got a new 64-ounce
milkshake that comes
in a plastic boot.

01:00.261 --> 01:03.531
Let's bounce.
I'll go grab my lactaid.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.499
What are you doing?
We were reading.

01:05.566 --> 01:09.703
He can read anytime.
But the milkshake boot's only
available while supplies last.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.072
Dave, boot!

01:12.140 --> 01:14.875
I feel like you're always
the one that does fun stuff
with him.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.477
He sees you as the fun one.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.979
Aw, thanks. I really do make
an effort with the boy.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.215
I'm serious.
All I do is read with him.

01:21.282 --> 01:24.752
And bitch and moan to me
about it, but continue.

01:24.818 --> 01:28.522
When he was little,
we used to have all kinds
of Mommy-Dave adventures.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.426
I would take him
to the beach,
the children's museum.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.728
Oh, my God.
I can't remember
the last time

01:34.795 --> 01:36.330
he and I did
something fun together.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.532
Come on. Just last week,
you took him

01:38.599 --> 01:40.768
to that...place
and he got a toy.

01:40.834 --> 01:43.137
That place
was the dentist.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.972
The toy
was a toothbrush.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.940
Okay, but you took him
to that aquarium.

01:47.007 --> 01:49.042
That was
also the dentist.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.978
There's a fish tank
in the lobby.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.746
The dentist
sounds like a blast.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.682
Hey, maybe I should
take him there.
(CHUCKLES)

01:54.748 --> 01:56.016
Dave, come on!

02:07.495 --> 02:09.263
That was awesome, Dad.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.399
Here, Mom.
Oh, thanks, Dave.

02:11.465 --> 02:15.369
Wash it by hand.
It says dishwasher-safe,
but I don't want to risk it.

02:15.436 --> 02:18.071
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Good night, partner.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.107
So, you had a good time,
huh?

02:20.174 --> 02:22.410
Well, tomorrow, he and I
are gonna have a good time.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.179
I'm taking him on an
old-school Mommy-Dave
adventure.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.481
I need to show him
that I can still be
the fun one.

02:27.548 --> 02:30.651
Good for you, Bae.
What are you gonna do?
Saddle Burger?

02:30.718 --> 02:31.919
No.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.222
Any lazy parent can take a kid
to Saddle Burger.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.125
I'm gonna solidify
our mother-son bond

02:38.192 --> 02:40.160
during this critical time
in his development.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.795
So, Saddle Burger.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.297
(LAUGHING) No.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.632
I went online
and found out

02:44.698 --> 02:46.334
the author of that
Merkel biography

02:46.400 --> 02:48.536
is doing a reading
tomorrow night downtown.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.871
It's an hour away.
It's gonna be like
a mini road trip.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.040
And he gets to stay up late.
Oh, he's gonna love it!

02:53.106 --> 02:55.943
Babe, stop selling.
It's Merkel. I get it.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.680
Hey, guys. What's up?

02:59.747 --> 03:01.315
Hey, Mol.
It's not even 9:00.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.050
What happened
to the party?

03:03.116 --> 03:05.118
Okay, I'll tell you guys
what happened

03:05.185 --> 03:06.854
if you promise
not to get mad at me.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.391
I don't think
we want to give up
our right to get mad.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.159
We might end up
wanting that.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.328
If we get mad,
she won't tell us.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.330
Good point.
Can we ask questions?

03:16.397 --> 03:18.266
Hmm, you each get one.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.133
I don't think we're gonna do
better than this.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.069
Fine. Proceed.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.572
Okay.
The police came
and shut down the party

03:24.638 --> 03:27.375
because some of the
kids were drinking
and they were underage.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.209
All right.
Is there more?

03:29.277 --> 03:30.911
No, and not a wise use
of your question.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.179
Damn!

03:32.246 --> 03:33.547
Hold on.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.149
Don't I get a question?
Yes! Good question, Mom!

03:36.216 --> 03:38.752
Damn.
Stop.

03:38.819 --> 03:43.156
New game. It's called
"Tell us if you were one of
the kids who was drinking."

03:43.223 --> 03:45.726
It's similar to scattergories,
except you tell us

03:45.793 --> 03:49.196
if you were one of the kids
who was drinking.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.198
I drank half a beer,
but I thought it was gross,

03:51.265 --> 03:53.467
so I dumped it out
on the lawn.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.304
Okay, honey.
Thank you for telling us.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.905
You're welcome.
Good night.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.914
"Thank you for telling us"?

04:06.980 --> 04:10.284
It's called
positively reinforcing
our daughter's honesty.

04:10.351 --> 04:14.187
Okay, while we're doing that,
I'm thinking boarding school,
the marines,

04:14.254 --> 04:15.656
something
in the religious world?

04:17.124 --> 04:19.226
Listen to you.
I thought you were
the fun one.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.729
I'm fun with Dave.
Molly's a raging alcoholic!

04:22.496 --> 04:23.964
Okay, okay, Ken.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.099
Take a knee.
Let's just talk this through.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.801
Oh, I know
what you're gonna say.

04:27.868 --> 04:31.038
"I'm Allison, our daughter
was honest with us,

04:31.104 --> 04:36.076
"just like I was
with my hippie parents
on that groovy commune."

04:36.143 --> 04:38.178
Look, there's no reason
to make this into a thing.

04:38.245 --> 04:41.415
But it is a thing.
Our teenage daughter
was drinking.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.783
You know what
my dad did to me

04:42.850 --> 04:44.452
the one time
he caught me drinking?

04:44.518 --> 04:45.619
This!

04:46.354 --> 04:47.688
He burned you?

04:47.755 --> 04:49.590
No, he said,
"I'm a-disappointed."

04:49.657 --> 04:51.291
For over an hour.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.327
I finally nodded off
and fell on my mom's
curling iron.

04:53.394 --> 04:57.731
But the point is,
he didn't just do nothing.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.200
Remember when you thought
Molly snuck out

05:00.267 --> 05:03.170
and I said we should back off,
but you couldn't let it go?
What happened?

05:03.236 --> 05:04.438
I went a little rogue.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.906
And then?
To a rave.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.174
And ended up?
In jail.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.476
Right.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.877
This time,
we do it my way.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.112
Hey, I did my time!

05:12.179 --> 05:14.648
Society forgave me.
Why can't you?

05:14.715 --> 05:15.949
Thug life, yo!

05:22.155 --> 05:25.426
People,
I'm gonna say a number,

05:25.493 --> 05:27.595
and I want you to tell me
what you think it represents.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.929
Seventy seven.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.864
Your I.Q.
How many girls
you had to ask to the prom?

05:30.931 --> 05:32.299
The number of times
you cried this week.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.434
The year
you bought that suit?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.770
The number of one-armed
push-ups you can do?

05:38.238 --> 05:40.808
I don't have
your guys' seniority.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.342
Latex gloves.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.378
Yesterday alone,
this wing of the clinic

05:44.445 --> 05:48.315
used 77 pairs
of these bad boys.

05:48.382 --> 05:52.319
From now on,
don't automatically put them
on for every appointment.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.354
You know, wait till
things start to get...

05:55.255 --> 05:57.558
Prostate-y.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.761
Pat, why don't you go climb
into the MRI machine with
all the people who like you.

06:03.230 --> 06:06.133
Okay.
But I'll be back.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.868
(CHUCKLING) I didn't
mean that threateningly.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.471
It's just I work here
and I often pass this way.

06:12.239 --> 06:15.676
Limit our glove use?
That is crazy fo' sho.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.511
Unh-unh, don't do that.
Really?

06:17.578 --> 06:19.379
We're not at that place where
we can playfully draw upon

06:19.447 --> 06:20.948
each other's stereotypes
for emphasis?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.550
No, you spit on me
when you said "fo' sho."

06:22.616 --> 06:24.284
Oh.

06:24.351 --> 06:27.488
Man, that guy always
manages to come in when
I'm in a bad mood.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.323
Ohh, what's crunching
your crackers, Dr. Ken?

06:32.192 --> 06:33.827
Molly.
She's been drinking.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.763
A lot?
Half a beer.

06:35.829 --> 06:39.600
Or as they call it in Korea,
a whore's breakfast.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.268
And Allison doesn't
even think we should...

06:41.334 --> 06:44.037
I'm sorry I'm late, everyone,
but there's a reason.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.973
Topher and I broke up.
(GASPS)

06:51.344 --> 06:54.548
Anyway, Allison doesn't
even want to punish her.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.416
So I'm supposed to
just sit by and watch

06:56.484 --> 06:59.787
while my daughter turns into
Dudley Moore from Arthur.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.722
Or Russell Brand
from Arthur!

07:01.789 --> 07:03.624
Or Russell Brand!

07:05.192 --> 07:07.628
It seems like the right
response for half a beer.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.296
Okay, Damona,
accurate sarcasm

07:09.362 --> 07:11.665
is not what Dr. Ken
needs right now.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.767
He needs a hug.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.504
Oh, okay, okay, all right.
Okay, I have
read this wrong.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.908
Sounds like
this marital conflict

07:20.974 --> 07:24.077
isn't just about not
wanting to take hip-hop
dance classes.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.346
It's about
teenage drinking.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.381
First of all, I'm taking
the class without her
and it's fine.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.851
I'm partnered
with the teacher.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.554
But you're right.
What am I gonna do?

07:33.621 --> 07:37.024
Well, when my mom caught me
sneaking a glass of wine,

07:37.090 --> 07:39.827
she sat me down and made me
drink the whole bottle.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.630
You know what?
I think your mom
had it figured out.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.164
Definitely,
she figured out

07:44.231 --> 07:46.266
how to give a 14-year-old
a Chablis dependency.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.169
Wait.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.138
You're gonna make Molly drink
until she gets sick?

07:52.172 --> 07:55.108
No. I'm gonna sit her down,
let her drink,

07:55.175 --> 07:57.511
and educate her about
what it does to people

07:57.578 --> 07:59.947
because
that's what doctors do.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.481
And that's what
I'm gonna do

08:01.549 --> 08:03.350
the moment I get home
from hip-hop class.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.129
Hello, Molly.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.565
Aah! Aah.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.199
Where are you going?

08:19.266 --> 08:21.034
To a party
at Kyle Cronin's house.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.903
Mmm-mmm.
Mom said I could go.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.805
Well, mom's not here,
is she?

08:24.872 --> 08:26.273
Seriously. Is she?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.209
It's not even
a big party.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.378
It's just some
kids hanging out.
And it's two blocks away.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.047
Well, you know which house
is no blocks away?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.215
Here.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.952
You're making me stay home?
I drank half a beer.

08:39.019 --> 08:43.156
(LAUGHS) I'm not gonna even
tell you what they call
that in Korea.

08:43.223 --> 08:46.760
Look, you're obviously
at an age where
you're around drinking, so...

08:46.827 --> 08:49.429
I just want to show you
the effects of alcohol
on the human body

08:49.496 --> 08:51.364
so you can make
responsible decisions.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.366
(SIGHS)
I cannot believe this.

08:53.433 --> 08:56.303
Well, believe it,
'cause it's happening,
and that is fo' sho.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.339
Ew.
Sorry.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.174
I get spitty
when I go urban, so...

09:03.176 --> 09:04.444
Just hear me out.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.446
The gloved hand
does the dirty work.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.281
You know, all the...
And...

09:09.482 --> 09:10.618
Ugh.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.122
But the bare hand
takes care of more
pedestrian tasks,

09:15.188 --> 09:18.458
like writing stuff down
or high-fiving the patient

09:18.525 --> 09:20.994
when the gloved hand
finds there's nothing wrong.

09:22.930 --> 09:26.166
I was about to go home early,
and then I realized,

09:26.233 --> 09:28.736
my place is here
with all of you.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.774
You know,
with the whole Topher thing.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.844
Does no one care
about my emotional life?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.779
I'm not sure
I know who you are.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.785
Excuse me,
but that is Dr. Julie...

09:44.852 --> 09:46.620
Oh, my God,
this is the wrong moment

09:46.687 --> 09:48.121
for me to have blanked
on her last name.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.490
Wow.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.960
Honey, you work
at a mid-level HMO.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.728
Where the supervisor
counts our gloves.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.897
What did you think
it was gonna be like,
Grey's Anatomy?

09:56.964 --> 09:59.166
Yes, I did.

09:59.232 --> 10:03.270
Grey's Anatomy is the reason
I wanted to become a doctor.

10:03.336 --> 10:08.308
The drama, the romance,
and much more
attractive people.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.845
Hey.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.214
They are
as God made them.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.785
I don't know
what y'all talking about.
I look good.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.754
I thought that
what was going on in
our personal lives

10:20.821 --> 10:23.190
would neatly dovetail with
what was going on with work.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.591
You know, like...

10:24.658 --> 10:27.327
"What are we gonna do
about this hypertension?"

10:27.394 --> 10:31.498
And "what are we gonna do
about this sexual tension?"

10:31.564 --> 10:35.635
And I thought that maybe,
just maybe,

10:36.369 --> 10:38.739
I would find my person.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.676
But I guess
that doesn't happen here

10:42.743 --> 10:44.211
at this
impersonal clinic,

10:44.277 --> 10:46.546
where average-looking people
greet you

10:46.613 --> 10:48.281
with above-average apathy.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.618
So now I know.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.387
Aw.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.124
You seem upset.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.326
Here.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.297
Have half a tissue.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.072
Do you think
he'll read about

11:12.139 --> 11:13.473
Angela's early years
as a chemist

11:13.540 --> 11:15.208
or focus on her
rise to power?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.110
Mm, maybe he'll do both,
Dave.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.712
Don't tease me, Mom.

11:21.614 --> 11:22.916
Are we gonna be late?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.451
(CHUCKLING) No.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.487
'Cause your awesome mom
left a time cushion.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.556
Oh, crap.
I missed the turn.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.560
(TIRES SCREECHING)

11:35.295 --> 11:37.464
Mom, was that
an illegal U-turn?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.933
(CHUCKLING) No.
(SIREN WAILING)

11:43.036 --> 11:45.705
Mom, was that every major
swear word in a row?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.743
Might have been, Dave.
Might have been.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.614
Alcohol is absorbed directly
into the bloodstream

11:54.681 --> 11:56.616
through the lining
of the mouth...

11:56.683 --> 11:58.518
And the tissue
that line the stomach
and the small intestine.

11:58.585 --> 12:01.554
Please don't interrupt.

12:01.621 --> 12:05.092
And the tissue
that lines the stomach
and the small intestine.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.694
Once
in your bloodstream,

12:07.761 --> 12:09.196
it's carried to the organs
of your body within...

12:09.262 --> 12:10.497
90 seconds.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.600
No, within about
90 seconds.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.670
Dad, I know all this.
Please let me go.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.740
Molly, there's a difference
between knowing it

12:20.808 --> 12:22.575
and experiencing it.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.712
Just go ahead
and take a sip.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.314
I don't want to.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.383
Seriously, it's okay.
I'm just trying
to create a safe space

12:30.450 --> 12:31.551
for you to try this.

12:33.553 --> 12:34.654
Fine.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.292
Ew.
This tastes like rust.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.128
Really?
This is a nice cab.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.266
(LAUGHING) Oh, man,
I needed that.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.538
Any idea why
I pulled you over?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.206
Not really.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.242
Was it for hanging
that sick U-ey?

12:55.308 --> 12:56.476
Bingo.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.247
Very dangerous maneuver,
ma'am.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.482
Agreed.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.951
I'll be back
in a minute.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.286
Wait, Officer.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.523
(CHUCKLING) I am...

13:10.590 --> 13:12.425
I'm really sorry
about what I did. I...

13:12.492 --> 13:14.727
But surely a tall,
handsome officer like you

13:14.794 --> 13:19.332
could find a way to
forgive a sweet,
silly woman like me?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.800
Please, sir?

13:21.835 --> 13:23.904
Ma'am, I'm not a sir.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.305
Copy that.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.119
Ahh.

13:39.186 --> 13:43.390
Now, how was I able to
drink that so fast?

13:43.456 --> 13:46.626
Here's a secret big daiquiri
doesn't want you to know.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.263
The fructose
in the strawberry

13:50.330 --> 13:52.665
masks the taste
of the alcohol.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.267
It masks it.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.005
"Hey, I'm the alcohol.
Where did I go?"

13:58.071 --> 13:59.572
Behind a mask.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.077
Okay.
Next lesson, shots.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.612
Maybe
you should slow down.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.280
Maybe you should
stop being my mommy.

14:09.016 --> 14:12.052
The thing to keep in mind
when doing shots is body mass.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.620
How much do you weigh?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.355
We weigh
exactly the same, Dad.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.925
96 pounds.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.692
Psst.
We should share jeans.

14:22.062 --> 14:26.799
The point is,
this will affect you and me
the exact same way.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.101
L'chaim.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.738
Whoo!

14:31.804 --> 14:33.273
That was noice!

14:33.340 --> 14:34.507
(LAUGHS)

14:34.574 --> 14:36.843
Man, this is fun.
We're having fun.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.279
"Yes, we are."
(LAUGHS)

14:39.346 --> 14:40.680
Of course we are.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.415
(HYSTERICALLY LAUGHING)

14:45.185 --> 14:46.619
The reading's full.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.156
No, seriously?
For this guy?

14:51.624 --> 14:53.426
No offense.
I'm sure it's great.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.229
It's okay, Mom.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.432
Hey, why don't we call dad
and meet him at Saddle Burger?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.935
No, no, no, no, no, Dave.
That's your fun thing
with dad.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.004
We can have
fun things, too.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.039
Here.
Wait over there, honey.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.109
Uh...sir?

15:09.176 --> 15:10.243
I...

15:10.310 --> 15:11.578
"Sir," right?

15:13.113 --> 15:14.814
Here's the thing, um...

15:14.881 --> 15:18.218
My son and I used
to do all this
great stuff together,

15:18.285 --> 15:19.552
and now
it's all going away.

15:19.619 --> 15:20.920
Why is it going away?

15:20.988 --> 15:25.325
Well, because...
He's...not well.

15:27.660 --> 15:31.664
Oh, so this is kind of
a make-a-wish thing for him?

15:32.599 --> 15:33.700
Sure.

15:35.002 --> 15:38.038
Oh, my God,
I am so sorry.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.639
Uh, hang on.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.608
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

15:46.913 --> 15:48.148
He's so brave.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.882
My little fighter.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.458
(SLURRING)
This morning,

15:58.525 --> 16:01.394
this morning,
I saw a raccoon

16:01.461 --> 16:03.596
stealing toys
from the Ericsons'
dog house,

16:03.663 --> 16:06.133
and I was like,
"you get out of here!"

16:09.869 --> 16:11.171
(CRYING)

16:13.773 --> 16:16.243
I love your mother
so much, man.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.780
You should respect
your mother.

16:20.847 --> 16:24.217
Although she overdoes it,
she has good intentions.

16:24.284 --> 16:28.955
And then that raccoon
disrespected me!

16:29.022 --> 16:31.158
You're not making
any sense, Dad.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.126
Aha!

16:33.193 --> 16:36.063
That's what I'm trying to
teach you, girl.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.965
It's the all-o-col.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.967
It messes
with your judgment.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.137
So, can I go
to that party?

16:44.904 --> 16:46.106
You better.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.510
Thanks, Dad.
You sure you're okay?

16:50.577 --> 16:53.180
We live in the golden age
of salted caramel.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.347
Enjoy it.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.389
(GERMAN ACCENT) It was
those weekends in Dusseldorf

17:02.455 --> 17:05.692
with her uncle Zigmund
where young Angela

17:05.758 --> 17:09.296
first discovered the joy
of political discourse.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.264
(SNORING)

17:14.934 --> 17:16.269
Is he okay?

17:16.336 --> 17:17.970
Yeah, he's fine.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.940
I mean...
Every snore is a gift.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.149
And then
he got totally wasted

17:29.216 --> 17:33.019
and shared some
very regressive thoughts
on the WNBA.

17:33.086 --> 17:36.489
It was the most uncomfortable
night of my life.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.425
Molly! Ow!

17:38.491 --> 17:39.592
Molly!

17:39.659 --> 17:41.461
Oh, God.

17:41.528 --> 17:45.098
This is called
a second wind.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.334
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

17:47.400 --> 17:48.468
(LAUGHS)

17:49.936 --> 17:51.371
Molly.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.406
I love you so much.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.910
I used to
give her a bath!

18:02.649 --> 18:04.151
What were
you thinking?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.652
I was trying
to teach Molly a lesson,

18:05.718 --> 18:07.420
and I guess
the wheels kind of
came off.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.021
Kind of?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.490
When I came home, you were
in the Ericsons' driveway,

18:10.557 --> 18:11.891
chasing their cocker spaniel
with a rake

18:11.958 --> 18:13.360
'cause you thought
it was a raccoon.

18:13.426 --> 18:17.430
I was protecting
my family.

18:17.497 --> 18:21.234
We agreed to deal with Molly
my way this time.
And what did you do?

18:21.301 --> 18:23.069
I went a little rogue.
And then?

18:23.136 --> 18:24.637
Got drunk
and fought a dog.

18:24.704 --> 18:25.772
And now you need?

18:25.838 --> 18:27.073
A rabies shot.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.511
Look, I'm sorry.
I completely screwed up.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.813
(LAUGHS)

18:33.880 --> 18:36.249
History just keeps repeating
itself, doesn't it? Ugh!

18:37.217 --> 18:39.786
I am not America's dad.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.954
Well, I'm not
America's mom, either.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.524
What's wrong with us?

18:44.591 --> 18:46.025
We've been parents
for 16 years.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.794
We should be better at it
by now.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.061
Dave didn't like
the Merkel dude?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.897
He slept through it,

18:50.963 --> 18:53.132
and that was after
I got nabbed for
an illegal U-ey,

18:53.200 --> 18:54.634
accidentally hit on
a lady cop,

18:54.701 --> 18:56.002
and pretended Dave
was terminally ill.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.305
You hit on a lady cop?

18:58.371 --> 19:01.040
Whatever you're picturing,
picture the opposite.

19:02.342 --> 19:05.044
Still plays.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.614
Hey, Mom, can we have another
adventure like last night?

19:07.680 --> 19:09.081
Really?
You had a good time?

19:09.148 --> 19:10.350
I thought
you fell asleep.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.719
I did, but mom drove
super-fast,

19:12.785 --> 19:15.288
said a bunch of swear words,
and the cops came.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.856
It was badass!

19:18.291 --> 19:20.627
You know what, Dave?
It was badass.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.495
And we're gonna do it
again soon.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.765
Hey.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.467
Oh, hey,
guess what, Molly.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.437
I'm wearing your jeans.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.142
Molly, Molly, wait.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.611
I'm sorry.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.847
Yeah, you should be.
You humiliated me.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.549
You looked like
a complete idiot,

19:42.615 --> 19:44.150
and trust me,
I am never gonna drink,

19:44.217 --> 19:46.886
because I never want to look
like you did last night.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.054
Dave.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.295
Did you hear that?

19:55.362 --> 19:57.630
She's never gonna drink!
It worked!

19:58.565 --> 20:00.533
I'm a good dad!

20:00.600 --> 20:02.101
And I'm a badass mom!

20:02.168 --> 20:04.036
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

20:04.103 --> 20:06.172
You know what?
Maybe we're getting
the hang of

20:06.239 --> 20:07.640
this parenting thing
after all.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.576
Fo' sho.
Ugh.

20:09.642 --> 20:10.910
Did I spit on you?

20:10.977 --> 20:12.979
No, it's just
racially uncool.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.247
Got it.

20:22.589 --> 20:23.756
Julie?

20:25.792 --> 20:29.028
I also watch
the Grey's Anatomy.

20:29.095 --> 20:33.666
And I was thinking that maybe
I could be your person.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.104
That is so sweet.
Hmm.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.739
Especially with
this whole Topher thing

20:39.806 --> 20:42.141
and not having anyone here
to share it with.

20:42.208 --> 20:46.045
I mean, I know deep down
he might not be the one.
No, no.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.714
Excuse me.
Dr. Julie Dobbs?

20:51.484 --> 20:52.985
Can I help you?

20:53.052 --> 20:55.488
Yes. I'm new here.
Can you take me
to the file room

20:55.555 --> 20:57.089
and show me
how to file these?

20:58.057 --> 20:59.426
Oh, my God.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.262
Do you know how rude it is
to interrupt a doctor

21:03.330 --> 21:05.432
when she's talking
to her person?

21:05.498 --> 21:07.734
But I just wanted to...
A-bup-bup! Rude!

21:07.800 --> 21:10.002
Just find the door
that says "file room," bro.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.910
Super annoying.
Anyway...

21:19.779 --> 21:21.348
