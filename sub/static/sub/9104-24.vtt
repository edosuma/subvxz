&lrm;[Marinette] Here I am, milady.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.120
&lrm;Glad to see you, Cat Noir.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.200
&lrm;Of course you are, I'm the cat's meow.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.040
&lrm;[she chuckles]

00:40.200 --> 00:42.600
&lrm;- He shouldn't say that.
&lrm;- No?

00:44.400 --> 00:45.200
&lrm;[cough]

00:45.360 --> 00:47.800
&lrm;This is no time to goof around, Cat Noir.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.840
&lrm;We've gotta capture
&lrm;the baddies' Akumas before...

00:51.000 --> 00:53.080
&lrm;Actually, what do the baddies want?

00:54.360 --> 00:55.600
&lrm;We want to win.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.520
&lrm;Yeah, but win what?

00:57.680 --> 00:59.960
&lrm;I dunno. What do they usually want?

01:00.280 --> 01:01.280
&lrm;Depends...

01:01.440 --> 01:03.840
&lrm;Lady Wi-Fi wanted to reveal
&lrm;Ladybug's identity.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.200
&lrm;Evillustrator wanted revenge
&lrm;on a girl for mocking him.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.960
&lrm;Then, there was Rogercop...

01:09.120 --> 01:11.960
&lrm;But the evil Hawk Moth
&lrm;who makes them bad

01:12.120 --> 01:14.920
&lrm;wants to take Ladybug's
&lrm;and Cat Noir's jewels,

01:15.080 --> 01:16.600
&lrm;their Miraculouses.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.560
&lrm;And what would happen
&lrm;if he did take them?

01:19.720 --> 01:21.800
&lrm;The bad guys... would win.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.200
&lrm;I know.
&lrm;I know what the bad guys want.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.960
&lrm;We want the Miraculous,

01:26.120 --> 01:29.200
&lrm;then we'll win, forever and ever!

01:29.360 --> 01:32.760
&lrm;I'm gonna get your Miraculous,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.000
&lrm;You... you..
&lrm;goodie-two-shoeses!

01:35.160 --> 01:37.360
&lrm;You'll be super-duper sorry.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.880
&lrm;[giggling]

01:39.040 --> 01:41.160
&lrm;You won't get our Miraculouses.

01:41.320 --> 01:42.400
&lrm;Yeah?

01:46.200 --> 01:48.880
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir have won again!

01:49.280 --> 01:51.880
&lrm;No fair. You always win.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.240
&lrm;[she cries]

01:54.400 --> 01:56.600
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir always win.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.960
&lrm;And the bad guys always lose.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.640
&lrm;But you never let me play
&lrm;with Ladybug and Cat Noir!

02:04.120 --> 02:05.440
&lrm;Don't cry.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.199
&lrm;Of course you can play with them.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.680
&lrm;I'll even let you borrow one of them.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.480
&lrm;[Mrs. Chamack] I'm back.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.840
&lrm;Have you been good?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.640
&lrm;[sobbing]
&lrm;Mommy! Marinette didn't let me win.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.560
&lrm;She didn't play fair and square.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.000
&lrm;Manon, you can't always expect to win.

02:23.160 --> 02:27.080
&lrm;Yes you can.
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir always win.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.240
&lrm;Well, you're right there
&lrm;but they're superheroes.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.480
&lrm;You'll win next time, Manon.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.760
&lrm;Now give the doll back to Marinette.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.200
&lrm;[angrily] No! I wanna keep her!

02:37.360 --> 02:40.080
&lrm;I told her she could borrow it.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.920
&lrm;That's sweet of you,
&lrm;but she already has so many toys

02:44.080 --> 02:46.200
&lrm;I wouldn't know where to put it.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.480
&lrm;[she gasps] No!

02:49.720 --> 02:50.960
&lrm;Look what you've done.

02:51.480 --> 02:52.440
&lrm;Give it to me.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.200
&lrm;[Manon sobs]

02:54.840 --> 02:56.880
&lrm;[mother sighs] I'm sorry, Marinette.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.240
&lrm;It's nothing. I can sew it up again.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.800
&lrm;It's no problem.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.120
&lrm;Thank goodness.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.360
&lrm;Come on, Manon, say goodbye.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.520
&lrm;I... want... that... doll!

03:07.680 --> 03:10.360
&lrm;No. You can play with it here, next time.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.200
&lrm;Come on, Manon,
&lrm;be a good girl and say goodbye.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.840
&lrm;[sobbing]

03:18.160 --> 03:19.200
&lrm;[sulkily] Goodbye.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.280
&lrm;[phone rings]

03:24.440 --> 03:25.560
&lrm;Hi, Alec.

03:25.720 --> 03:29.240
&lrm;Didn't I leave it for you
&lrm;on my desk at the station?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.400
&lrm;I left my bag up there, Mommy.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.760
&lrm;Go quickly.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.280
&lrm;It's not there?

03:41.800 --> 03:44.920
&lrm;I think our heroes are in need
&lrm;of a little TLC.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.520
&lrm;[gasping]

03:48.800 --> 03:49.680
&lrm;Manon, what...?

03:50.280 --> 03:51.320
&lrm;I left my bag.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.600
&lrm;Can I have Ladybug?

03:58.760 --> 04:01.200
&lrm;[she sighs] You heard what your mom said.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.000
&lrm;She won't know if I hide it.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.160
&lrm;Sorry, but I have to sew her up.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.720
&lrm;Pretty please.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.840
&lrm;Please, please, not the baby-doll eyes.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.360
&lrm;[she whimpers]

04:20.120 --> 04:22.760
&lrm;[sighing] Ok, you can borrow Lady Wi-Fi.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.960
&lrm;Can I have the Ladybug doll?

04:27.400 --> 04:28.480
&lrm;Hold on, Alec.

04:28.640 --> 04:29.600
&lrm;Hurry, Manon!

04:29.760 --> 04:32.120
&lrm;[mother] We have to stop by the station!

04:32.800 --> 04:34.280
&lrm;Coming, Mommy!

04:37.240 --> 04:40.240
&lrm;She sure had you wrapped
&lrm;around her little finger.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.800
&lrm;What? No she...

04:41.960 --> 04:43.080
&lrm;[she groans]

04:43.240 --> 04:45.720
&lrm;You know, Tikki,
&lrm;I can't say no to those...

04:45.880 --> 04:47.680
&lrm;[Tikki] Baby-doll eyes?

04:48.080 --> 04:50.840
&lrm;Just be glad no baddies have them.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.160
&lrm;You'd be rendered powerless.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.920
&lrm;[Manon] Here I am, baddy.

04:58.080 --> 05:03.280
&lrm;[pretend fighting]

05:03.720 --> 05:06.720
&lrm;[triumphantly] I saved Paris again!

05:06.880 --> 05:08.160
&lrm;No! No fair!

05:08.320 --> 05:10.000
&lrm;You always win!

05:11.160 --> 05:13.840
&lrm;Sorry, Alec, it must be in the studio.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.120
&lrm;No sweat.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.800
&lrm;Can you watch Manon?

05:16.960 --> 05:18.040
&lrm;I won't be lon...

05:18.400 --> 05:20.600
&lrm;Where are you hiding,

05:21.160 --> 05:22.440
&lrm;Ladybug?

05:22.600 --> 05:23.520
&lrm;[she gasps]

05:23.680 --> 05:26.760
&lrm;This is one of Marinette's dolls.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.840
&lrm;You took it, after I specifically
&lrm;told you not to.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.640
&lrm;But, but Marinette wanted me to have it.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.880
&lrm;You disobeyed me.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.160
&lrm;I told you they were to stay there.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.920
&lrm;You won't need it anymore.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.400
&lrm;No, Mommy, please don't.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.360
&lrm;I'm not happy about this.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.240
&lrm;Wait for me here.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.600
&lrm;[frustrated sigh]

05:49.760 --> 05:50.960
&lrm;[she huffs]

05:59.680 --> 06:02.080
&lrm;I didn't steal that doll!

06:02.240 --> 06:04.360
&lrm;I... want... that... doll!

06:06.000 --> 06:07.520
&lrm;[satisfied sigh]

06:07.680 --> 06:11.600
&lrm;What could be more pure
&lrm;than an innocent child's emotions,

06:11.880 --> 06:13.720
&lrm;especially anger?

06:13.880 --> 06:15.480
&lrm;I love it.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.920
&lrm;Fly away, evil Akuma,

06:22.080 --> 06:25.000
&lrm;and commiserate
&lrm;with this frustrated child.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.280
&lrm;[he cackles]

06:27.440 --> 06:30.480
&lrm;[dramatic music]

06:31.160 --> 06:32.800
&lrm;[panting]

06:36.040 --> 06:37.560
&lrm;The movie starts soon.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.280
&lrm;Or we can buy your book
&lrm;and go to the next one.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.440
&lrm;Either way.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.800
&lrm;[she gasps] Marinette, 9 o'clock.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.200
&lrm;There isn't one at 9.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.480
&lrm;Not that 9 o'clock, this 9 o'clock.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.440
&lrm;Adrien.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.240
&lrm;Come on!

06:54.400 --> 06:55.480
&lrm;[she squeals]

06:56.480 --> 06:57.320
&lrm;[giggling]

06:57.480 --> 06:58.720
&lrm;[Marinette] Sorry.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.160
&lrm;[fluttering]

07:02.040 --> 07:03.840
&lrm;[sobbing]

07:06.320 --> 07:09.880
&lrm;[evil voice] Puppeteer, I'm Hawk Moth.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.960
&lrm;From now on, you can control anyone.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.240
&lrm;Even Ladybug and Cat Noir?

07:16.400 --> 07:20.080
&lrm;Yes, as long as you possess their dolls.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.160
&lrm;And I can win?

07:22.320 --> 07:25.120
&lrm;Yes, you will be able to win.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.840
&lrm;But in return,
&lrm;you must do something for me.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.720
&lrm;Bring you their Miraculouses.

07:31.880 --> 07:32.800
&lrm;I know!

07:34.240 --> 07:37.360
&lrm;What a smart little girl you are.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.320
&lrm;[gasping]

07:42.920 --> 07:44.360
&lrm;Wanna play a game?

07:44.680 --> 07:46.000
&lrm;Help!

07:46.480 --> 07:49.280
&lrm;I gotta get
&lrm;those Ladybug and Cat Noir dolls.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.920
&lrm;I... want... those... dolls!

07:53.400 --> 07:57.360
&lrm;[dramatic music]

07:58.800 --> 08:00.560
&lrm;I'm sure I left it here.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.920
&lrm;Where is it?

08:02.080 --> 08:03.960
&lrm;[dramatic music]

08:04.680 --> 08:06.920
&lrm;Here it is.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.240
&lrm;Sorry, Alec.
&lrm;Here's the file you need.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.800
&lrm;[cackling]

08:13.160 --> 08:14.840
&lrm;[bleeping]

08:15.280 --> 08:16.960
&lrm;I wonder where he gets off.

08:17.120 --> 08:20.600
&lrm;Maybe he's going to the same movie.
&lrm;How cool would that be?

08:20.920 --> 08:21.800
&lrm;But wait!

08:21.960 --> 08:25.360
&lrm;Then he might think
&lrm;we're following him, like stalkers.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.360
&lrm;Me? A stalker?
&lrm;Although I would follow him.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.560
&lrm;I wouldn't really stalk him.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.039
&lrm;[groaning] Who am I kidding?

08:33.880 --> 08:36.159
&lrm;[Alya giggles] Who are you talking to?

08:45.760 --> 08:47.640
&lrm;He's waving.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.400
&lrm;Oh no, now what are we gonna do?

08:50.560 --> 08:51.640
&lrm;Wave back.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.440
&lrm;[tinkling]

08:57.600 --> 08:59.600
&lrm;OK, Lady Wi-Fi,

09:01.120 --> 09:02.200
&lrm;come to life!

09:02.720 --> 09:04.040
&lrm;[tinkling]

09:04.200 --> 09:05.480
&lrm;[tinkling]

09:05.640 --> 09:07.360
&lrm;What's going on?

09:07.520 --> 09:08.200
&lrm;Alya!

09:10.560 --> 09:12.280
&lrm;[lively music]

09:12.800 --> 09:14.360
&lrm;Marinette,

09:14.520 --> 09:17.040
&lrm;gimme those Ladybug and Cat Noir dolls!

09:17.480 --> 09:18.560
&lrm;Lady Wi-Fi?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.880
&lrm;No! I'm Puppeteer.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.080
&lrm;And I want... those... dolls, now!

09:24.640 --> 09:26.360
&lrm;Puppeteer? The dolls?

09:26.520 --> 09:28.920
&lrm;I don't have them, they're at home.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.120
&lrm;Why do you want them, Puppeteer?

09:31.280 --> 09:34.200
&lrm;Because you said I could have them.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.000
&lrm;Then mommy said "No!"

09:36.160 --> 09:37.720
&lrm;So giv'em to me now!

09:37.880 --> 09:40.040
&lrm;Or you'll be super-duper sorry.

09:40.960 --> 09:41.880
&lrm;Manon.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.640
&lrm;I want Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir's Miraculouses.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.200
&lrm;To win... forever and ever.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.680
&lrm;Manon, this isn't a game!

09:59.360 --> 10:00.440
&lrm;Excuse me, Sir.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.720
&lrm;There's a... a cat loose on the train.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.440
&lrm;What? Thanks kiddo.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.280
&lrm;[Plagg] Cat?

10:06.440 --> 10:07.480
&lrm;Plagg, We have to transform.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.040
&lrm;Just when we'd lost your bodyguard.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.400
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

10:12.560 --> 10:15.440
&lrm;What about the movie?
&lrm;The buttery popcorn!

10:29.720 --> 10:31.760
&lrm;Tikki, I have to transform.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.000
&lrm;That was Lady Wi-Fi.
&lrm;Did she say anything?

10:35.440 --> 10:36.760
&lrm;I'm not sure,

10:36.920 --> 10:39.720
&lrm;but... her voice belonged to
&lrm;a girl I babysit.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.040
&lrm;It's as if she was controlling my friend,
&lrm;Alya,

10:43.200 --> 10:45.440
&lrm;I mean Lady Wi-Fi, from a distance.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.800
&lrm;This is so weird.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.640
&lrm;What was all that about dolls?

10:48.800 --> 10:51.400
&lrm;I've got some dolls
&lrm;she likes to play with.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.920
&lrm;Your dolls? OK, where do you live?

10:54.200 --> 10:56.480
&lrm;- 12, rue Gotlib.
&lrm;- I'll take care of it.

11:00.760 --> 11:04.400
&lrm;I don't like the idea of Cat Noir
&lrm;rummaging around in my room.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.200
&lrm;Just say the words.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.360
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

11:28.480 --> 11:33.040
&lrm;[panting]

11:38.480 --> 11:39.360
&lrm;[Ladybug] Hey, kitty!

11:39.520 --> 11:40.640
&lrm;Up here!

11:41.120 --> 11:42.320
&lrm;[panting]

11:44.960 --> 11:47.000
&lrm;[Ladybug] Puppeteer! Such a shame.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.080
&lrm;It's really not nice to steal
&lrm;from your babysitter.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.040
&lrm;Breaking and entering are grounds
&lrm;for a time out.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.000
&lrm;I'll get your Miraculouses,

11:55.160 --> 11:56.720
&lrm;you goodie-two-shoeses.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.200
&lrm;There's only one goodie-two-shoes here,

11:59.360 --> 12:00.760
&lrm;and I'm not her.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.040
&lrm;Freeze!

12:04.560 --> 12:06.680
&lrm;Remember how
&lrm;we defeated her last time?

12:06.840 --> 12:08.200
&lrm;Take out the Wi-Fi.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.440
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Gotcha.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.680
&lrm;[she yells]

12:19.160 --> 12:20.880
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Nice move, Puppeteer.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.360
&lrm;Good girl.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.520
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Now take her Miraculous!

12:27.760 --> 12:29.440
&lrm;Cataclysm!

12:33.560 --> 12:34.560
&lrm;[dramatic music]

12:39.720 --> 12:40.720
&lrm;[she yells]

12:41.800 --> 12:43.280
&lrm;[she gasps and groans]

12:43.720 --> 12:46.040
&lrm;Looks like you've lost your signal, Wi-Fi

12:48.800 --> 12:50.040
&lrm;Where's the Akuma?

12:50.720 --> 12:53.720
&lrm;I want those dolls, Lady Wi-Fi!

12:57.040 --> 12:58.120
&lrm;[crashing]

13:01.440 --> 13:02.320
&lrm;[she gasps]

13:03.040 --> 13:03.960
&lrm;[she groans]

13:04.120 --> 13:06.400
&lrm;- Did you get her Akuma?
&lrm;- She didn't have one.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.280
&lrm;How come?

13:07.440 --> 13:10.480
&lrm;She's controlled by Puppeteer,
&lrm;she must have it.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.760
&lrm;Right. Lady Wi-Fi's just a puppet.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.880
&lrm;Tell me you got my doll.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.520
&lrm;Sorry... only this one.

13:17.680 --> 13:21.000
&lrm;We better find her
&lrm;before she takes control of me.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.520
&lrm;Your ring.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.160
&lrm;You're about to turn back.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.480
&lrm;Don't let her make me her puppet.
&lrm;I like to be in command.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.600
&lrm;You mean second in command.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.920
&lrm;Call me when you're back in business.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.200
&lrm;[phone rings]

13:34.360 --> 13:36.440
&lrm;Yes? What? Ladybug?

13:36.760 --> 13:37.600
&lrm;Where are you?

13:37.760 --> 13:39.160
&lrm;At the TV station.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.400
&lrm;Is Manon there?

13:40.840 --> 13:43.120
&lrm;Yes, she's playing downstairs.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.600
<i>&lrm;Is everything okay?</i>

13:44.760 --> 13:47.240
&lrm;Yes, just don't move.
&lrm;I'll be right there.

13:55.640 --> 13:59.280
&lrm;I'm gonna use these dolls
&lrm;to beat Ladybug fair and square.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.440
&lrm;[Plagg] What? I'm savouring my cheese.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.320
&lrm;Can you savour it faster?

14:08.840 --> 14:10.880
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

14:27.200 --> 14:29.400
&lrm;[bleeping]

14:29.560 --> 14:31.040
&lrm;She's still here.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.680
&lrm;I need you all outside.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.920
&lrm;No, I want to find my daughter.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.840
&lrm;I'll bring her back, Mrs. Chamack.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.440
&lrm;It'll help me more if I know you're safe.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.480
&lrm;Evillustrator,

14:43.640 --> 14:44.640
&lrm;come to life!

14:47.120 --> 14:48.760
&lrm;[dramatic music]

14:48.920 --> 14:50.040
&lrm;[he gasps]

14:50.200 --> 14:51.280
&lrm;[he growls]

14:51.760 --> 14:54.080
&lrm;Rogercop, come to life!

14:55.520 --> 14:57.400
&lrm;[gasping]

15:04.240 --> 15:05.400
<i>&lrm;Have you found her?</i>

15:05.560 --> 15:06.960
&lrm;At the TV station.

15:07.120 --> 15:07.920
<i>&lrm;Got it!</i>

15:08.480 --> 15:13.080
&lrm;[panting]

15:13.840 --> 15:15.640
&lrm;[dramatic music]

15:15.800 --> 15:17.080
&lrm;[she gasps]

15:17.240 --> 15:18.880
&lrm;I'm OK. I'm not a puppet.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.080
&lrm;Let's find the Akuma
&lrm;before that changes.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.160
&lrm;Sorry.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.840
&lrm;On three.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.760
&lrm;One... two...

15:26.200 --> 15:27.240
&lrm;three!

15:28.240 --> 15:30.160
&lrm;Cat Noir, come to life!

15:30.320 --> 15:31.080
&lrm;No!

15:33.800 --> 15:37.240
&lrm;[dramatic music]

15:37.560 --> 15:38.920
&lrm;Cat Noir, no!

15:39.080 --> 15:41.600
&lrm;Use Cat Noir to seize Ladybug's doll.

15:42.080 --> 15:46.240
&lrm;Then you'll have won everything
&lrm;and Ladybug will be defeated.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.600
&lrm;[together] Gimme that ladybug doll!

15:48.960 --> 15:50.720
&lrm;I'm gonna get your Miraculous!

15:51.080 --> 15:52.640
&lrm;Not so fast, rug rat.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.920
&lrm;The Akuma must be in there.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.600
&lrm;[she yells]

16:00.920 --> 16:02.000
&lrm;Stop her!

16:02.160 --> 16:04.920
&lrm;[he groans]

16:05.080 --> 16:06.200
&lrm;Sorry, Cat Noir.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.120
&lrm;[gasping]

16:08.560 --> 16:11.640
&lrm;One against five.
&lrm;That's not very fair and square.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.800
&lrm;This is the moment I've been waiting for.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.240
&lrm;Your time is up, Ladybug.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.080
&lrm;You're doomed!

16:19.520 --> 16:21.120
&lrm;The Ladybug doll!

16:21.280 --> 16:22.400
&lrm;Get it!

16:23.040 --> 16:25.640
&lrm;[lively music]

16:25.800 --> 16:28.160
&lrm;Thanks, Evillustrator. Now, the doll.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.640
&lrm;Is this what you want? Say pretty please.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.720
&lrm;The doll. She got away with it.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.000
&lrm;Get her!

16:43.520 --> 16:49.400
&lrm;[panting]

16:49.560 --> 16:51.520
&lrm;[dramatic music]

16:52.360 --> 16:53.640
&lrm;Where did she go?

16:53.800 --> 16:56.080
&lrm;First I have to get rid of them,
&lrm;then Puppeteer.

16:57.560 --> 16:58.720
&lrm;[groaning]

16:59.240 --> 17:01.640
&lrm;[lively music]

17:11.760 --> 17:14.720
&lrm;If you want this doll so badly,
&lrm;come and get it.

17:16.319 --> 17:17.680
&lrm;[she yells]

17:21.520 --> 17:22.920
&lrm;I'm faster than you.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.359
&lrm;You're going to lose, Ladybug.

17:25.800 --> 17:26.800
&lrm;[dramatic music]

17:27.280 --> 17:28.680
&lrm;[child gasps]

17:28.840 --> 17:31.600
&lrm;Gimme that doll. It's mine!

17:31.760 --> 17:33.080
&lrm;[child screams]

17:33.400 --> 17:34.680
&lrm;I'll get you Ladybug.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.600
&lrm;You'll be super-duper sorry.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.360
&lrm;Now you're alone...

17:38.520 --> 17:39.520
&lrm;[she gasps]

17:40.720 --> 17:42.240
&lrm;Where is she?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.120
&lrm;Now I'm the winner.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.160
&lrm;Drop that doll, Manon!

17:52.640 --> 17:55.000
&lrm;I'm not Manon, I'm Puppeteer.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.040
&lrm;Luck charm!

18:08.440 --> 18:09.920
&lrm;A power strip?

18:10.840 --> 18:13.040
&lrm;[Puppeteer] You've lost, Ladybug!

18:23.160 --> 18:26.000
&lrm;There may be 4 of you,
&lrm;but I'm twice as dangerous.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.840
&lrm;[he roars]

18:42.480 --> 18:43.760
&lrm;[he yells]

18:46.000 --> 18:47.520
&lrm;[he gasps]

18:50.880 --> 18:53.000
&lrm;[Rogercop groans]

18:58.520 --> 18:59.440
&lrm;Ladybug...

18:59.600 --> 19:00.280
&lrm;Freeze!

19:00.440 --> 19:01.360
&lrm;Come to li...

19:02.520 --> 19:03.720
&lrm;[dramatic music]

19:07.600 --> 19:11.480
&lrm;[whistling]

19:15.040 --> 19:17.320
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.080
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

19:26.360 --> 19:27.360
&lrm;Gotcha!

19:28.760 --> 19:30.520
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.800
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:37.280 --> 19:38.200
&lrm;[gasps]

19:39.960 --> 19:41.000
&lrm;[she gasps]

19:41.320 --> 19:42.320
&lrm;What happened?

19:42.480 --> 19:45.240
&lrm;You were a puppet
&lrm;but you didn't do anything foolish.

19:45.640 --> 19:46.960
&lrm;Good, and Ladybug,

19:47.120 --> 19:50.120
&lrm;FYI, you can pull
&lrm;my heart strings any day.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.520
&lrm;I liked you better
&lrm;when you sounded like a 5-year-old.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.120
&lrm;[angrily] No!

19:55.280 --> 19:57.760
&lrm;This cannot be happening!

19:57.920 --> 19:59.360
&lrm;[he groans angrily]

20:01.080 --> 20:02.280
&lrm;[gasping] Manon!

20:02.880 --> 20:03.760
&lrm;[giggling]

20:05.800 --> 20:07.840
&lrm;Thank you, Ladybug. Thank you.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.120
&lrm;It's time I bug out.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.760
&lrm;[Marinette] I'm sorry about what happened,
&lrm;Mrs. Chamack.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.400
&lrm;I shouldn't have given her
&lrm;the doll after you said no.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.720
&lrm;Manon can be pretty persuasive.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.240
&lrm;Yeah, with her...

20:21.400 --> 20:24.160
&lrm;Baby-doll eyes? Yes, I know.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.320
&lrm;See you later, then. Kiss, Manon.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.000
&lrm;[chuckling]

20:29.280 --> 20:30.360
&lrm;Bye, mommy.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.480
&lrm;See you later, Mrs. Chamack.

20:32.960 --> 20:33.840
&lrm;Bye-bye.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.800
&lrm;I wanna play with Ladybug and Cat Noir.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.480
&lrm;[she sighs]

20:39.640 --> 20:42.560
&lrm;I've a better idea.
&lrm;Why don't we go to the zoo?

20:42.960 --> 20:46.760
&lrm;But I want to play with the dolls.
&lrm;Pretty please.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.680
&lrm;Don't even try it, Manon.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.520
&lrm;I love the zoo.

20:56.920 --> 20:57.920
&lrm;I'm ready.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.320
&lrm;[giggling]
