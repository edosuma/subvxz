what is the latest

00:06.715 --> 00:09.259
One day, you're into it,
the next you want a divorce.

00:09.301 --> 00:14.222
It's been a real
roller-coaster
of who-gives-a-crap.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.934
Listen, I think I can
make this marriage work.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.727
I mean,
I can't keep chasing
teenagers forever.

00:20.688 --> 00:24.608

it might start to
look pathetic.

Audrey a voicemail.

You know what,
just tell her.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.125
I mean,
she eats like a horse,

00:42.167 --> 00:45.921
and, uh, she always
wants to do it.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.883
She's the closest
thing to a guy that

00:48.924 --> 00:49.884
All right.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.469
There's this phone app
called Shy Dial.

to talk to her.

Clear the way,
he's got a threesome!

13:38.693 --> 13:40.194
Threesome comin' throug!

13:40.236 --> 13:46.367
How big is this!
All right, go on!

13:46.409 --> 13:47.368
Mr. Dunbar?

13:49.120 --> 13:50.079
Mr. Dunbar?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.084
Hello, Timothy.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.920
Where's Mr. Dunbar?

13:57.962 --> 13:59.922
He sent me a text
to meet him here.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.468
(GASPS)
Ooh, that was me.
I stole his phone.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.930
You'll never guess
what I've got on
under this coat.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.182
Lots of layers?

14:10.224 --> 14:11.518
Maybe something
with a drawstring

14:11.559 --> 14:13.394
that has a stubborn
knot in it?

14:13.436 --> 14:15.021
Nothing. Nada.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.107
Except, of course,
my Spanx.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.947
Mrs. Dunbar,
what of your husband?

14:24.989 --> 14:27.158
Oh, please.
He can't keep up with m.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.618
I've been
grinding the poor guy
down to a nub.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.744
Now come on.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.413
If you don't waste
time with foreplay,

14:32.455 --> 14:35.625
you'll be in and out
like Seal Team 6.

14:35.667 --> 14:36.543
(GASPS)

14:38.712 --> 14:40.171
I'm so sorry.
Was Osama your guy?

14:42.173 --> 14:43.132
No, of course not.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.802
Either way,
it's not a deal-breaker.

14:47.094 --> 14:49.305
RUSSELL: Timmy.

14:49.347 --> 14:50.223
Timmy, you here?

14:52.058 --> 14:52.851
Tim...

14:53.810 --> 14:54.977
Liz.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.772
Hello, Russell.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.607
What's going on here?
I came back
to look for my phone,

14:59.649 --> 15:01.150
and you're standing
here in the dark?

15:01.192 --> 15:03.778
I stole your phone
and came to your office

15:03.820 --> 15:05.739
on the chance
that you might
come looking for it.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.116
Uh, so we could
do it on your desk.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.747
Well, that makes...

15:15.081 --> 15:16.833
Total sense, yeah!
Let's do it!

15:30.971 --> 15:32.766
Audrey, I'm here.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.143
Audrey? Betsy?
So you started without ?

15:41.566 --> 15:43.234
That's all right.
I'm not, I'm not mad.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.152
Audrey, Audrey.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.280
Where is she?

15:48.698 --> 15:50.450
Gee, I don't know, Jeff.
Why don't you Shy Dial her?

16:04.672 --> 16:06.299
I'm getting a strong
feeling that, uh,

16:08.635 --> 16:09.886
Betsy's not
actually in there.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.807
But

16:15.308 --> 16:21.439
I owe it to myself
to at least check.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.023
(RUSSELL GRUNTING)

16:23.065 --> 16:24.567
LIZ: What's my name?
RUSSELL: Mommy!

16:24.609 --> 16:25.777
What's my name?
Mommy!

16:27.612 --> 16:29.781
Oh, wait, mommy,
my back's giving out.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.532
Just, uh, you know,
maybe you get on top?

16:32.742 --> 16:34.368
Of course, lover.
Not too bouncy, though,

16:34.410 --> 16:36.537
I'm still
burping up that
turkey chili from dinne.

16:36.579 --> 16:37.831
Okay, now
I got a better idea.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.081
I'm gonna stand up, oka?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.626
So wait,
you slide over here...

16:42.168 --> 16:43.169
(SCREAMING)

16:47.507 --> 16:48.716
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

16:53.179 --> 16:53.972
What, Jeff?

16:54.931 --> 17:00.895
See, it didn't
go to voicemail.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.229
I uninstalled
the Shy Dial.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.442
Well, good for you.
That fixes everything.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.699
You're still mad.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.536
Look,
it's not like I don't
like talking to you,

17:17.871 --> 17:19.914
it's just that sometimes
you drag me into things

17:19.956 --> 17:21.582
that aren't
that interesting,
like, uh, paint colors,

17:21.624 --> 17:22.709
or how your day was.

17:23.877 --> 17:24.752
(CHUCKLES)

17:26.546 --> 17:28.840
Uh, how many times
have you talked my leg f

17:28.882 --> 17:31.300
about the stupid
Mets bullpen?

17:31.342 --> 17:33.052
Or that the
meat-lovers' pizza
went up by a dollar?

17:36.138 --> 17:37.515
That was
a slap in the face.

17:37.557 --> 17:41.310
They know that
we're meat-lovers.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.187
They have us
over a barrel.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.981
Yes, we've had
this conversation,

17:45.023 --> 17:47.734
and never once
have I cared about it.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.736
But I pretended to,
because that's what
you do in a marriage.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.029
You pretend to care.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.743
You know, back when
we were first married

17:58.411 --> 18:01.789
I pretended
all the time.

18:01.831 --> 18:02.832
I guess
I just got lazy.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.459
That's on me.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.546
So, uh, tell me stuff.
Go ahead.

18:09.296 --> 18:11.173
No, you don't have to.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.550
I insist.
Tell me about your day.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.593
And as far as you know,

18:14.635 --> 18:15.511
I will care.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.642
All right.
I'll take it.

18:21.684 --> 18:22.727
Well, uh, for starters,

18:23.937 --> 18:27.189
I think today I found us
a beautiful crib.

18:27.231 --> 18:35.949
With a baby on the way,
I don't think it's
the right time to move.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.993
So,
given the circumstances,

18:41.537 --> 18:42.997
Liz and I have agreed
to get a divorce.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.208
Circumstances
being that she
tried to nail Timmy,

18:47.668 --> 18:50.088
but then
nailed you with Timmy
underneath your desk.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.345
It was right there
in front of my face.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.309
That's too bad.
You were just starting
to like being married.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.268
I tried.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.229
But the whole thing
was a joke.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.773
I mean, come on,
it was never gonna work.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.942
Mere inches from my fac.

19:24.622 --> 19:25.706
What's going on?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.086
Why are you dressed
like a gay four-year-ol?

19:33.339 --> 19:34.882
Where are they holding
the Willy Wonka auditio?

19:37.426 --> 19:39.553
Mock all you want.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.849
When Chris gets here,
he's gonna shove it
in your face.

19:42.890 --> 19:49.313
Please don't
phrase it that way.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.107
Oh, wow,
he should actually
be here by now.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.151
He's pretty eager
to back me up.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.236
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

19:56.278 --> 19:58.698
Oh. Chris called. Hmm.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.909
Hey, Adam, listen,
something came up today,

20:01.951 --> 20:04.162
and I'm kind of busy, s.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.621
I'll probably just
see you around.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.999
Good luck
with the clothes.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.291
Thank you, Shy Dial.

20:14.505 --> 20:15.422
Whoa, that is fierce!

20:17.383 --> 20:18.384
Told you, dude.

20:19.010 --> 20:19.969
Cash or charge?

20:25.850 --> 20:28.519
Hey, listen, this thing
that happened today,
it's still nagging at m.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.229
Well, you wanna
talk about it some more?

20:30.270 --> 20:31.064
I do.
This threesome
with Betsy...

20:31.105 --> 20:32.065
Forget it.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.946
That is never,
never gonna happen.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.866
Oh, interesting.
I only heard two "never.

20:45.078 --> 20:49.165
That's one less
than before.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.250
It's pretty pathetic,
but if you wanna
hang your hopes on that,

20:51.291 --> 20:54.879
then knock yourself out.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.089
He got one less "never"!

20:56.964 --> 20:57.965
(ALL CHEERING)
