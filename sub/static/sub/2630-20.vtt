00:02.836 --> 00:04.628
Okay, guys, listen.

00:04.879 --> 00:07.381
Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.

00:07.632 --> 00:10.426
So try to really keep
Ross' mind off of it.

00:10.593 --> 00:12.052
- Okay.
- Good idea.

00:12.220 --> 00:13.804
Hey, man. What's up?

00:15.098 --> 00:17.808
Just thinking about Emily
getting married tomorrow.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.980
Oh, Ross. Look, look.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.441
What? Where?

00:25.608 --> 00:28.193
Right over there. There.
Look, look, look.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.531
- What am I looking at?
- Somebody help me out here.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.035
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.163
Monica, sorry I didn't come by.
I was out with Gary.

00:39.414 --> 00:43.834
He let me ride around with him.
We saw and prevented crimes.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.170
- You got to go on a ride-along?
- Uh-huh.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.839
- I want to go on a ride-along.
- Me too.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.716
- Okay.
- Yeah. Me too.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.676
Really? You?

00:54.929 --> 00:56.472
Yeah.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.517
- Well, it's kind of dangerous.
- Well, I like danger.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.896
- Okay, you guys free tonight?
- Yeah.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.608
You didn't say
it was gonna be at nighttime.

02:01.621 --> 02:02.621
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.624
I'm glad you're home.
We can finally organize these photos.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.835
Oh, thank God.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.169
Finally.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.090
I've broken them down
into categories.

02:13.341 --> 02:16.176
We got holidays,
birthdays, candids...

02:16.427 --> 02:18.762
And I've cross-referenced them
by subject.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.014
So if you're looking up, say...

02:21.266 --> 02:24.143
...birthdays and dogs,
you get photo 152.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.435
See?

02:27.105 --> 02:29.231
Oh, it's me and LePoo.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.733
Wow, I miss that dog.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.903
You can also find him
under "dog" and "dead."

02:37.198 --> 02:38.198
Great. Thanks.

02:38.908 --> 02:42.244
Hand me that other box of photos.
That's the last one.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.668
Oops.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.170
Sorry.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.213
Good thing you numbered them.

02:53.464 --> 02:54.464
I hadn't.

02:54.632 --> 02:57.426
Photo 152 was a prototype.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.054
Honey, it's okay. It's okay.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.474
How about I fix you a drink?
Maybe a margarita?

03:04.976 --> 03:06.518
Ross has the blender.

03:06.936 --> 03:10.105
Everything's just falling apart.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.859
It's okay. I'll go to Ross',
get the blender.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.570
- You get the margarita stuff ready.
- All right.

03:16.821 --> 03:19.656
His keys are in the drawer.
Also, I need some cash.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.241
Want me to stop at the ATM?

03:21.492 --> 03:24.786
No. While you're at Ross',
if you see any lying around.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.665
- What?
- What?

03:28.833 --> 03:30.834
I don't do that.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.556
That was so cool, man.
The way you leaned on that guy.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.309
It is starting to get dark out there.

03:47.977 --> 03:50.646
He told you everything.
You cracked him.

03:50.897 --> 03:54.149
He was the victim.
They're usually pretty talkative.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.945
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.

03:59.447 --> 04:02.532
- Want me to grab the berry?
- It's called a cherry.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.160
It's called... Chandler.

04:10.124 --> 04:12.292
Okay, I got it.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.796
This place makes
the best sandwich in the world.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.755
Does it have meatballs?

04:17.966 --> 04:18.966
Oh, yeah.

04:19.132 --> 04:20.801
Melted cheese and marinara sauce?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.302
Yep.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.263
You can't eat that in my car.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.308
Yeah, okay.

04:28.476 --> 04:31.728
Even though my tax dollars
paid for this car.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.606
Your tax dollars?

04:36.943 --> 04:38.777
Yeah, okay.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.452
Wow, that sandwich smells good.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.579
Did I say you could smell it?

04:50.665 --> 04:51.915
I can't smell it?

04:52.333 --> 04:56.712
Half the taste is in the smell.
You're sucking up all the taste units.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.880
Okay, I'll give them back.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.303
What is so great about that sandwich?

05:05.305 --> 05:09.516
- Okay. Imagine the best sex you ever had.
- Okay.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.977
- Are you thinking about Monica?
- Yeah.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.353
What's that like?

05:26.659 --> 05:29.828
Please don't be from a real dinosaur.
Please, please.

05:30.079 --> 05:33.665
Please, please, please.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.168
"Made in Mexico." Yes!

05:38.296 --> 05:40.422
Who would buy this?

05:47.889 --> 05:49.556
Rach, it's me. Pick up.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.268
What's up?

05:53.478 --> 05:55.437
I need more margarita things.

05:55.688 --> 06:00.817
I need some salt,
some margarita mix and tequila.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.779
So all we had was ice?

06:04.155 --> 06:05.530
See if he has ice.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.741
Okay.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.754
Hello, Ross?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.297
It's Emily here.

06:22.548 --> 06:26.635
I know this is out of the blue,
but I'm getting married tomorrow.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.762
Well, maybe I am...

06:29.013 --> 06:30.972
I keep thinking about you.

06:31.682 --> 06:35.394
And I'm wondering if we made
a mistake giving up so fast.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.562
Are you thinking about me?

06:37.730 --> 06:41.233
No, of course you're not.
But if you are, call me tonight.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.110
Okay, bye.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.412
Where we going?

06:53.579 --> 06:56.915
This witness won't return my calls.
We'll surprise him coming home.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.752
Surprise him? We're not gonna
make anybody mad, are we?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.838
Come on, man.

07:03.089 --> 07:07.342
You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes
a bit before he lawyers up?

07:07.593 --> 07:10.178
He's a witness, not a perp.
And no one talks like that.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.224
Yeah. No one talks like that.

07:14.475 --> 07:18.186
- Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
- I'm more cop than you two.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.063
How do you figure that?

07:20.273 --> 07:22.524
I'm in the front seat, okay?

07:23.317 --> 07:25.610
I'm Gary's partner.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.530
When you say "partner,"
it doesn't sound cop.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.740
It sounds gay.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.119
Um, jealous.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.582
- Hey, we're undercover here.
- Oh, yeah. No problem.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.668
- Ross.
- Sorry.

07:42.837 --> 07:43.962
There.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.884
Hey, Gary. Who am I?

07:49.093 --> 07:50.760
Phone home.

07:54.098 --> 07:57.225
Look at Officer Ross riding
back here with the visitors.

07:58.686 --> 08:01.104
What's up with that, Serpico?

08:04.525 --> 08:07.819
Are you thinking about me?
No, of course you're not.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.071
But if you are, call me tonight.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.948
Okay, bye.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.744
No.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.663
I know.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.792
Thank God you were here.
We have to erase that.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.878
What? We can't do that.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.172
We have to.
What if Ross hears that...

08:27.381 --> 08:29.508
...and calls her
and they get back together?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.802
Is that what you want?
Ross back with that controlling...

08:33.011 --> 08:36.431
...neurotic, crazy Emily
who wouldn't let him see you?

08:36.849 --> 08:38.725
No. Oh, no, no.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.561
God, no. He should not
get back with her.

08:41.812 --> 08:45.315
I know that, you know that.
Even Ross knows that.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.817
But we have no right
to erase his message.

08:48.069 --> 08:52.656
Look, I'm his sister and I love him.
I don't want to see him get hurt.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.033
Doesn't that give me
the right to control...

08:57.078 --> 08:58.662
Help him?

08:59.497 --> 09:01.831
He's not the one who needs help.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.669
She's obviously unstable.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.297
She's thinking about running
out on her wedding day.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.846
Okay, fine. But look at
the position she's putting him in.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.974
And what's he gonna do?

09:19.183 --> 09:22.269
Break up their marriage
on their wedding day?

09:22.520 --> 09:24.354
Who would do that?

09:28.025 --> 09:31.611
Okay, fine. All right.
But that was different.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.156
Although it did involve
a lot of the same people.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.910
This is some twisted joke
she's playing on him.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.247
You are crazy.
She sounded genuinely upset.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.748
I mean, listen.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.251
Your messages have been erased.

09:46.502 --> 09:49.462
No.

09:51.799 --> 09:55.594
Okay, but we're safe, right?
Nothing bad's gonna go down.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.138
No. But that reminds me. Sign this.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.472
What is it?

09:59.724 --> 10:02.392
It says you can't sue
if you scrape your knee...

10:02.643 --> 10:04.227
...or get your head blown off.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.732
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.

10:09.817 --> 10:10.817
Here he comes.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.654
What is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?

10:14.905 --> 10:15.905
What is it?

10:16.073 --> 10:17.532
- Is everything okay?
- What?

10:17.742 --> 10:21.077
He sees us. Don't move.
And don't look at him.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.346
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.183
Hey, look at that.
You tried to save your buddy.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.560
You see that?

10:45.853 --> 10:47.520
You see what he did?

10:48.189 --> 10:49.606
You okay, man?

10:50.733 --> 10:52.317
Uh-huh.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.527
Thanks, Joey.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.823
Uh... Hello?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.494
Hi.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.085
We should go.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.252
No, wait.

11:11.462 --> 11:12.545
Oh, yeah. Right.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.881
No. Monica.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.300
Monica, we have to fix this.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.678
What can we do?
You erased the message.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.429
Unless we tell him.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.016
If you want to be rational,
I can't argue with you.

11:25.309 --> 11:26.726
All right?

11:27.019 --> 11:30.397
Fine, tell him. I just don't
want to be a part of it.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.485
Maybe that's Emily leaving
the exact same message.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.947
Hey, Ross, it's you.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.199
I just want you
to remember this feeling.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.452
You are lucky to be alive.

11:44.662 --> 11:47.914
So live every day to the fullest.

11:48.165 --> 11:51.084
Love yourself, okay?

11:51.627 --> 11:53.628
And also get stamps. Bye.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.842
Play that message for Emily,
and this problem goes away.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.135
Right?

12:01.762 --> 12:03.555
Anybody want to meet a hero?

12:03.806 --> 12:05.932
John Glenn is here?

12:06.600 --> 12:07.642
No. Joey.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.145
We had the most incredible night.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.605
- We're in the car...
- Wait. Hold on.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.484
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.445
Okay, go ahead.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.032
So we're in the car, and bang.
A shot was fired.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.786
And Joey, with no regard
for his own safety...

12:27.037 --> 12:29.080
...throws himself on me.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.373
My God.

12:30.624 --> 12:33.126
It was a car backfire.

12:33.335 --> 12:34.836
But he didn't know that.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.713
Yeah, I didn't know that.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.676
It could just as easily
have been a bullet.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.929
Ever think about joining the force?
We could use a guy like you.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.223
Who jumps at loud noises.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.228
Wow. I could have died tonight.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.315
If the car that backfired
had run over you.

12:56.942 --> 13:00.820
I'm going before he starts rambling
about his newfound respect for life.

13:01.071 --> 13:04.741
I do have a newfound respect for life.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.786
Oh, my God.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.500
- You want to get some dinner?
- Yeah, sure.

13:13.667 --> 13:18.505
You know what? If I heard a shot
right now, I'd throw my body on you.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.341
Maybe we should walk
in a bad neighborhood.

13:21.592 --> 13:22.884
Okay.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.805
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.477
Cut it out.

13:32.686 --> 13:36.439
I'd hate to save your life
and kick your ass on the same day.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.491
Dude.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.159
Why'd you take off?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.620
Just going for a walk.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.331
Around the living room, whatever.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.919
- Is something wrong?
- No. No, I'm just tired.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.421
You know, from the walk.

14:01.715 --> 14:02.715
Okay.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.009
You dove in front of Ross.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.345
Ross.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.973
That's what this is about.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.811
Oh, my God. You hate Ross.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.188
I don't hate Ross.

14:17.398 --> 14:21.192
Of course you do. I saved him.
You're mad at me. It adds up.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.987
You want Ross out of the picture.

14:24.738 --> 14:25.738
What picture?

14:25.906 --> 14:28.575
I don't know.
But I don't like what I'm hearing.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.745
I'm glad you saved Ross.
But it could've been a bullet.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.206
And you didn't try to save me.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.041
Oh.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.461
You're upset because you think
I chose Ross over you.

14:40.671 --> 14:45.174
No, I knew you could
take care of yourself.

14:45.342 --> 14:49.304
You know? I mean, Ross needs help.
He's not "street" like us.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.141
You'd risk your life for Ross
before you would for me.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.018
That's the bottom line.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.979
No, not exactly.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.814
All right, look.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.026
I wasn't trying to save Ross.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.069
Okay?

15:06.196 --> 15:08.823
My sandwich was next to Ross.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.243
All right?

15:13.579 --> 15:16.331
I was trying to save my sandwich.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.959
From a bullet?

15:21.003 --> 15:24.172
- I know it doesn't make much sense.
- "Much" sense?

15:24.340 --> 15:27.675
Chandler, it was instinct.
I just went for it.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.345
You risked your life for a sandwich?

15:30.554 --> 15:32.597
I know it sounds crazy...

15:32.848 --> 15:37.310
...but this is the greatest
sandwich in the world.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.190
So you didn't choose Ross before me?

15:42.441 --> 15:44.901
No. I would never do that.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.028
You're like my brother.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.989
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:50.282 --> 15:54.702
In fact, to prove how much
you mean to me...

15:59.375 --> 16:00.375
Here.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.128
- Thanks.
- Easy, it's not a hot dog.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.095
How good is that?

16:12.346 --> 16:14.055
Oh, yeah.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.182
See?

16:16.350 --> 16:17.642
What are you doing?

16:19.395 --> 16:21.604
You're showing me how much
I mean to you.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.189
With a bite.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.441
Jeez.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.001
Hi.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.503
What are you doing here?

16:45.713 --> 16:47.005
Hey, you know what?

16:47.214 --> 16:49.549
You are in our apartment
all the time.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.260
This is just a drop
in the bucket, mister.

16:54.138 --> 16:58.307
It doesn't matter. The important thing
is that you're here.

16:58.559 --> 17:02.103
You're my friend and you're here.

17:07.317 --> 17:10.194
Okay, just a little scared.
What's going on?

17:10.404 --> 17:12.905
The most amazing thing
happened tonight.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.450
I thought my number was up.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.578
I had an actual near-death experience.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.038
What happened?

17:20.289 --> 17:24.709
We were on the ride-along with Gary
and somebody took a shot at me.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.130
Really?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.466
No. A car backfired.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.930
But I thought somebody was taking
a shot at me. And, Rach...

17:38.098 --> 17:39.640
...I survived.

17:41.435 --> 17:45.480
And I was filled with
this great respect for life.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.982
I want to experience every moment.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.486
I want to seize every opportunity.

17:51.695 --> 17:55.364
I am seeing everything so clearly now.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.742
Because a car backfired?

17:58.452 --> 18:00.453
Okay. Why are you here?

18:02.164 --> 18:06.334
I don't know how this fits
into your whole seizing thing...

18:06.585 --> 18:08.169
...but Emily called you today.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.714
- You talked to her?
- She left a message.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.841
But it kind of got erased.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.595
I mean, there's something
wrong with your machine.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.222
What did she say?

18:19.890 --> 18:23.810
Something about having second
thoughts about the wedding.

18:24.019 --> 18:27.063
And did you guys make
a mistake breaking up?

18:27.648 --> 18:29.732
And she wants you to call her.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.651
Wow.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.029
That was a good thing
that I told you, right?

18:35.864 --> 18:37.698
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.952
Okay, thank you. Thank you. Because...

18:41.203 --> 18:43.621
I'm gonna tell Monica I was right.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.540
Because she didn't want...

18:45.749 --> 18:50.294
Not important. Point is,
I was right. Your decision.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.462
Okay?

18:51.630 --> 18:52.922
I was right.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.924
Your decision.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.634
Right.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.095
I guess I should call Emily.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.597
No, that's not the right decision.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.307
That's not right.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.809
Ross, come on.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.644
I mean...

19:06.937 --> 19:08.896
...that woman made you miserable.

19:09.648 --> 19:10.648
Okay, Ross?

19:10.858 --> 19:13.401
Do you really want
to get back into that?

19:15.070 --> 19:16.821
Okay, look. Yesterday...

19:17.072 --> 19:20.199
...I wouldn't have even
considered calling her back.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.910
But my ex-wife calls
on the same day...

19:23.120 --> 19:25.580
...I have a near-death experience?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.832
That's gotta mean something.

19:28.041 --> 19:32.962
That was not a near-death experience.
That was barely an experience.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.339
You weren't there.

19:37.050 --> 19:40.845
Maybe this is something that
I'm supposed to seize, you know?

19:41.805 --> 19:44.056
Okay. You know what?

19:44.308 --> 19:48.102
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.898
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.

19:52.482 --> 19:53.941
Okay? Look at today.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.735
I mean, you escaped...

19:56.445 --> 19:57.445
...death.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.867
And maybe this is a chance
for you to escape...

20:03.118 --> 20:05.036
...getting back together with Emily.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.997
That does make sense.

20:09.791 --> 20:13.544
Because I do want to seize
some opportunity...

20:13.795 --> 20:17.381
...but I really don't want
to see or talk to her.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.677
Well, there you go.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.180
Yeah, maybe today's just...

20:25.015 --> 20:27.183
...close-call day.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.395
Hey, thanks, Rach.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.272
Oh, honey. No problem.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.984
Wait, wait. The message is blinking.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.111
Maybe you didn't erase it.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.822
Hey, Ross, it's you...

20:42.449 --> 20:46.619
That's an old message.
Nobody needs to hear that.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.081
Hey, um, was Monica here?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.540
Yeah.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.542
I want my money back.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.046
You probably need that
for stamps, right?

21:05.055 --> 21:06.055
Hey, Pheebs?

21:06.223 --> 21:08.015
Has Gary ever been shot at for real?

21:08.225 --> 21:09.350
Yes, once.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.602
A little.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.063
He kind of did it to himself.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.774
It's not really a good story.

21:17.609 --> 21:21.112
I wonder how I'd react under fire.
And not backfire...

21:21.321 --> 21:22.863
...but heavy fire.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.116
Like if I was in a war.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.243
Man, I would be great in a war.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.454
I think I'd make
a fantastic military leader.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.292
I mean, I know I'd make general
before any of you guys.

21:34.793 --> 21:38.045
Before or after you were shot
by your own troops?

21:38.588 --> 21:42.341
I know Joey would be in the foxhole
protecting all of us.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.344
If the foxhole was
lined with sandwiches.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.848
Yeah, hero sandwiches.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.813
You all know I'm a pacifist,
so I'm not interested in war in any way.

21:56.064 --> 21:59.358
But when the revolution comes,
I'll have to destroy you all.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.861
Not you, Joey.
