00:26.893 --> 00:28.918
That's what I call
a serious four-wheeler.

00:28.995 --> 00:30.121
Well, what do you do?

00:30.196 --> 00:31.629
I'm a nuclear physicist.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.132
Just what is it you want?
The Pegasus missile.

00:34.334 --> 00:37.826
Wait! Monica. Dr. Knightwood, remember?

00:37.904 --> 00:39.599
Just as I thought.
It's window glass.

00:41.441 --> 00:44.274
I'm going to make you
very sorry.

00:45.945 --> 00:47.572
Michael, you're playing
with suicide.

00:47.647 --> 00:49.581
Suicide is letting them
get away with that missile.

00:49.649 --> 00:50.775
Let's do it!

01:05.165 --> 01:07.656
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

01:07.734 --> 01:10.225
into the dangerous world
of a man...

01:10.336 --> 01:12.099
who does not exist.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.071
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.148 --> 01:24.616
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:24.684 --> 01:26.914
the helpless, the powerless...

01:26.986 --> 01:30.183
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.526
Harley, I didn't
expect you until...

03:21.601 --> 03:23.660
I have to talk to you.
It's important.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.399
Look, if it's about what
I think it... Bianca.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.167
I won't let you
do this to me.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.902
But you don't have
any choice in the matter.

03:29.976 --> 03:31.341
Yes. Yes, I do.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.810
Harley,
for the last time...

03:32.879 --> 03:35.439
if you don't give me the
information on the courier...

03:36.249 --> 03:39.150
I'm going to take
this tape of us to your wife.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.346
You can't. You wouldn't!

03:41.788 --> 03:43.813
How much do you wanna bet?

03:48.895 --> 03:51.125
Wait a minute. Bianca, please.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.366
Let me give you something else.
I've got a little money, some stocks.

03:54.434 --> 03:55.958
The information, Harley.

03:56.035 --> 03:59.095
My wife is very ill. Don't
you have any pity? What kind...

03:59.539 --> 04:02.337
What kind of woman are you?
A businesswoman.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.468
You wouldn't have had
as much fun with a saint.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.215
Well, Harley?

04:13.686 --> 04:17.519
Tanya, see that
Harley's loving wife...

04:18.024 --> 04:19.082
gets this tape.

04:19.158 --> 04:20.648
Right away.
No!

04:21.661 --> 04:22.753
Wait.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.828
Then you have
the courier's route?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.089
Yeah.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.657
Give it to me.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.543
That's a good little boy,
Harley.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.980
I'm sure we'll be doing
more business in the future.

04:46.152 --> 04:47.881
No, Bianca. No!

04:48.254 --> 04:49.414
Tanya!

05:02.235 --> 05:04.703
I had to use the full charge.
He was going to shoot.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.238
I understand.

05:07.006 --> 05:10.908
Wait till all the guests are
asleep, and drive him up the coast.

05:11.177 --> 05:14.578
But remember, Tanya,
make it look like an accident.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.145
Now, let me get this straight.

05:22.221 --> 05:24.553
One, we're on our way
to the beach.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.785
Right. Two, when we get to the beach...

05:26.859 --> 05:30.090
you're going to put a parachute on
your back and secure a towing line...

05:30.163 --> 05:33.030
to my rear bumper. So far,
you're batting a thousand.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.932
That's what worries me.
Three, when I get the word...

05:36.002 --> 05:38.232
Grab the sun.
Grab the sun.

05:38.538 --> 05:43.066
I'm to race down the beach until I
get enough speed to make you airborne.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.574
That's right.
It's called parasailing.

05:45.645 --> 05:48.409
Wrong. It's called
total insanity.

05:48.648 --> 05:52.379
Well, it just happens to be one of
the most popular sports in Acapulco.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.852
Only there, they do it
off the backs of motorboats.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.718
Michael, we're not
in Acapulco...

05:56.789 --> 06:00.691
and I have about as much in common with
a motorboat as you have with a seagull.

06:01.894 --> 06:03.486
Devon is calling.

06:03.563 --> 06:04.894
Yo, Devon.

06:05.231 --> 06:07.722
Michael, it's Bonnie.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.125
What's wrong?

06:09.202 --> 06:12.569
A good friend of hers was
killed last night in a car crash.

06:12.638 --> 06:15.163
Harley Freeman.
We suspect foul play.

06:15.274 --> 06:17.003
All right,
I'll be right there.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.189
How you doing?

06:42.268 --> 06:43.826
He was a wonderful man.

06:45.671 --> 06:47.002
I'm sorry.

06:51.511 --> 06:52.842
Where did it happen?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.504
On Seaview Road.

06:54.847 --> 06:58.908
He was thrown from his car after
crashing into a transformer pole.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.053
One of the broken wires
electrocuted him.

07:02.121 --> 07:05.784
Unfortunately, there were also indications
that he'd been drinking rather heavily.

07:05.858 --> 07:07.348
I don't believe that.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.451
Bonnie.

07:08.528 --> 07:11.588
I never saw him have more than
a glass of wine with dinner.

07:11.664 --> 07:13.791
How long have you known him?

07:14.434 --> 07:17.995
For at least 10 years. He was
one of my professors at MIT.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.366
We became good friends.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.273
He gave up teaching about two years
ago and joined Megafax Industries...

07:23.342 --> 07:25.333
so that he could be
closer to his wife.

07:25.411 --> 07:28.574
She's been ill and
confined to a hospital nearby.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.707
Because of the sensitive
nature of his work...

07:31.784 --> 07:33.183
it was all highly
classified...

07:33.252 --> 07:35.880
and because of the
circumstances of his death...

07:35.955 --> 07:39.982
there's going to be a security
investigation and Bonnie feels...

07:41.227 --> 07:44.685
Well, Michael, Bonnie would
like you to get involved in it.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.028
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.

07:48.434 --> 07:51.460
Look, you know I would do
anything for you. But...

07:51.537 --> 07:54.165
Michael, if you think you're
going to find something, you won't.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.502
Suppose I do?

07:55.575 --> 07:58.373
Harley would never do anything
to betray his country.

07:58.444 --> 08:00.139
Look, I'm sure
you're right about that...

08:00.213 --> 08:02.272
but what if there's the
slightest chance you're not?

08:02.348 --> 08:05.579
I mean, what's that going
to do to our friendship?

08:08.287 --> 08:10.653
I've thought about that. I'd
be lying if I said I hadn't.

08:10.723 --> 08:11.747
And?

08:11.824 --> 08:14.190
If Harley was involved
in something...

08:14.260 --> 08:16.353
he wasn't supposed to be...

08:17.497 --> 08:19.522
then I'd rather
hear it from you.

08:19.632 --> 08:22.260
And don't worry,
I won't shoot the messenger.

08:23.402 --> 08:24.494
Yeah.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.335
All right.

08:39.318 --> 08:43.083
You're sure you don't want to take
one of the other girls with you?

08:43.155 --> 08:45.055
Why, don't you
trust me?

08:45.591 --> 08:47.889
Trust has nothing
to do with it.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.085
Harley's micro guidance
system...

08:50.162 --> 08:53.427
makes everything else we've
ever stolen look like a toy.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.626
That, along with the Pegasus
missile Sendrax recently developed...

08:57.703 --> 08:59.466
will be worth millions
to us.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.006
Then you found
a buyer?

09:01.073 --> 09:04.167
Yes, but I have to
make delivery by tomorrow.

09:04.510 --> 09:05.499
Tomorrow?

09:05.578 --> 09:07.944
But you're not even close
to the Pegasus missile yet.

09:08.014 --> 09:12.075
Look, an opportunity like this
comes along only once in a lifetime.

09:12.618 --> 09:15.917
There's no way I'm gonna let
this slip through my fingers.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.853
I'll get that missile.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.581
You just worry about
getting the guidance system.

09:21.594 --> 09:22.618
You better get going.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.595
Okay. I'll be back
before you know it.

09:24.664 --> 09:25.653
Okay.

09:30.169 --> 09:32.865
Monica, did you see
Mr. Cooper anywhere?

09:33.506 --> 09:35.098
He's over there.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.236
Thanks.

09:44.884 --> 09:47.580
Mr. Cooper,
welcome to the Retreat.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.054
My name's Bianca Morgan.
I'm the owner.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.317
Nice to meet you.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.693
Veronica, why don't you
bring Mr. Cooper a drink?

09:55.761 --> 09:57.456
Coming right up.
Thank you.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.498
I hope you're having
a relaxing time here.

09:59.565 --> 10:02.363
Just what the doctor ordered
to recharge my batteries.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.562
I know what you mean.
My father was a physicist.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.661
No kidding.

10:05.738 --> 10:08.172
Yes. In fact, I built
this retreat in his memory.

10:08.240 --> 10:12.176
A place for all the scientific
community to come and exchange ideas...

10:12.244 --> 10:14.769
catch up on their
correspondence, meditate...

10:14.847 --> 10:17.441
or just lie in the sun
and do nothing.

10:18.217 --> 10:19.650
Do you mind if I join you?

10:19.719 --> 10:20.913
Not at all.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.318
Thank you.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.916
Sheeba, quiet down.

10:26.325 --> 10:28.225
Two specialties
of the Retreat.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.057
Thank you, Veronica.
Thank you.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.300
So, what company do you
work for, Mr. Cooper?

10:35.501 --> 10:36.991
Please, call me Ted.

10:37.069 --> 10:41.165
I work for Sendrax Industries. Actually,
though, I'm not really a scientist.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.764
Oh, no?
Mmm-mmm.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.807
I'm head of security.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.712
Well, what do you know
about that?

10:49.949 --> 10:51.678
Cheers, Mr. Cooper.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.515
It's funny. I've never been
in his house before.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.354
What did you find?

11:02.461 --> 11:06.557
Something he wrote on a previous piece
of paper. Looks like a phone number.

11:08.968 --> 11:12.699
Tristate Courier. It's routing
information with today's date.

11:14.373 --> 11:17.467
I'm sure it's not important.
It could mean anything.

11:17.543 --> 11:20.137
Bonnie, if I want to get to the
truth, I gotta follow this up.

11:20.212 --> 11:22.203
This and everything else.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.646
KITT.
Right here, Michael.

11:24.717 --> 11:28.517
See if Tristate Courier is delivering
anything for Megafax, will you?

11:28.587 --> 11:30.384
I'll get right on it.

11:33.959 --> 11:35.017
Wow.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.020
For a guy who only had
an occasional sip of wine...

11:38.097 --> 11:40.327
he sure has
a well-stocked bar.

11:40.399 --> 11:44.426
I don't understand it, Michael. I
could be in a complete stranger's house.

11:44.503 --> 11:47.870
Bonnie, sometimes people
change and we don't know why.

11:50.309 --> 11:52.607
All right.
So Harley changed.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.671
He drank more...

11:55.648 --> 11:58.139
and he obviously didn't care
as much about neatness...

11:58.217 --> 12:01.778
but that doesn't mean he was
involved in anything illegal.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.721
Yeah, you're right.

12:03.789 --> 12:06.849
But it sure adds a new
dimension to his profile.

12:07.259 --> 12:09.693
You have any idea
who this girl is?

12:12.231 --> 12:13.858
No.
Wait a minute.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.056
"The Retreat."

12:17.236 --> 12:19.500
Yeah, what is it?
Your hunch was right, Michael.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.735
One of Dr. Freeman's projects,
a microcomputer guidance system...

12:22.808 --> 12:25.641
is on its way to a testing
facility this very moment.

12:25.711 --> 12:27.474
Plot out the courier's route,
will you?

12:27.546 --> 12:29.741
You're acting as though there's
been a crime committed...

12:29.815 --> 12:32.716
Wait a minute here.
We had a deal, remember?

12:32.785 --> 12:35.345
If I deliver bad news,
you won't shoot the messenger.

12:36.822 --> 12:38.050
You're right.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.524
Okay. So why don't you
stay here...

12:40.593 --> 12:42.288
check out the photographs
and the diaries...

12:42.361 --> 12:44.329
and see if there's any mention
of this retreat...

12:44.396 --> 12:45.488
okay?

12:46.899 --> 12:48.230
Okay.
Okay.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.873
I've plotted the courier's
route, Michael.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.068
He should be coming up
to the foothill junction now.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.771
All right, let's cut him off!

13:53.566 --> 13:55.295
You having trouble?

13:55.935 --> 13:57.596
It's just a flat tire.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.160
Maybe I can give you a hand.

14:26.332 --> 14:28.391
Michael, that's
the courier's car up ahead.

14:28.467 --> 14:30.697
And that's the courier
lying next to it.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.168
What about that four-by-four?

14:32.238 --> 14:35.503
That'll have to wait till later,
pal. Scan his vitals, will you?

14:38.143 --> 14:40.236
He's in a state of shock,
Michael.

14:40.312 --> 14:43.679
All right, we better give him a
hand. Let's get him to the hospital.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.591
Michael, look out.

15:00.833 --> 15:01.822
Michael.

15:02.701 --> 15:03.690
KITT!

15:03.769 --> 15:05.259
Hurry, Michael. Get in.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.344
That's what I call
a serious four-wheeler.

15:42.241 --> 15:43.708
Any word from the hospital?

15:43.776 --> 15:47.940
The courier's still unconscious,
but his vital signs have stabilized.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.842
Michael, you didn't even
get a glimpse of the driver?

15:50.916 --> 15:52.679
No. It all happened
too fast.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.186
Bonnie, we got another problem. What?

15:56.255 --> 15:58.382
The four-wheeler that
attacked us was steel-plated...

15:58.457 --> 15:59.981
and armed with
a concealed weapon.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.686
With KITT's molecular
bonded shell...

16:01.760 --> 16:03.318
that shouldn't have been
a problem, Michael.

16:03.395 --> 16:06.193
I know, but the bullets are.

16:06.999 --> 16:09.832
KITT analyzed them
as being Tufflex-coated.

16:10.402 --> 16:11.733
His tires.

16:12.905 --> 16:17.001
They can withstand the impact of
conventional bullets, but not Tufflex-coated.

16:17.076 --> 16:20.068
I mean, Tufflex can even
penetrate a bulletproof vest.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.976
Got some more
bad news for you.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.773
Michael, I know
what you're going to say...

16:24.850 --> 16:27.114
but just because Harley had a
note of the courier's route...

16:27.186 --> 16:29.211
doesn't mean he had anything
to do with the theft.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.586
Then why did he write the
note? And where is the note?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.386
Better yet, why did he
go out of his way...

16:33.459 --> 16:36.519
to find out the courier's
route in the first place?

16:36.595 --> 16:38.062
I don't know.

16:38.764 --> 16:42.461
But I'm positive there's got to
be some logical explanation...

16:42.534 --> 16:45.662
and I don't think it had anything
to do with greed or disloyalty.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.638
Maybe not,
but one thing's for sure.

16:47.706 --> 16:51.403
That micro guidance system is
definitely in the wrong hands.

16:53.445 --> 16:56.437
Look, what else did you get
at Harley's place?

16:57.216 --> 16:58.615
I don't know. Take a look.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.453
It's a company photograph
taken about three months ago...

17:02.521 --> 17:04.614
at a restaurant called SI14.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.751
The "SI" is a symbol for silicon
and the "14" is its atomic number.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.790
It's great for trivia games.
What else?

17:12.998 --> 17:14.989
It's in an area
known as Silicon Valley...

17:15.067 --> 17:17.694
because of all the high-tech
industries located there.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.431
Including Megafax.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.338
Michael, see the bar
at the end of the table?

17:24.343 --> 17:26.140
Let me move in on it.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.543
The lady at the Retreat.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.880
And she seems to be
eyeing Harley.

17:32.951 --> 17:34.475
Like a vulture.

17:39.491 --> 17:40.685
KITT...

17:41.126 --> 17:42.957
I know it would be
asking a lot...

17:43.028 --> 17:46.486
but can you make me into a
brilliant computer scientist?

17:46.732 --> 17:49.929
Michael, that's not asking a
lot, that's asking a miracle.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.467
Doesn't seem possible,
does it?

17:54.807 --> 17:58.743
That this little computer board can send
a missile halfway around the world...

17:58.811 --> 18:01.211
guide its multiple warheads
to various targets...

18:01.280 --> 18:04.807
and then send the missile home
safe to its launch sites.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.842
Aren't you forgetting
one thing, Bianca?

18:07.920 --> 18:11.481
First, you have to have the missile,
and the Pegasus missile at that.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.855
I told you. I'm working on it.

18:14.693 --> 18:16.217
Meaning Ted Cooper?

18:18.397 --> 18:21.594
Whose company just happens
to build the Pegasus...

18:21.767 --> 18:25.999
and whose wife just happens to be
in New England visiting her parents.

18:27.272 --> 18:31.003
That doesn't give you a lot of
time. What if he's the faithful kind?

18:31.076 --> 18:35.172
They're all the faithful kind as long
as they think they can get away with it.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.376
See what I mean?

18:46.892 --> 18:51.022
Ted, come in. It's all right,
Tanya was just about to leave.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.126
Have fun.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.558
I'm glad you could make it.
I am, too.

18:58.203 --> 19:00.728
If I tell you something,
you promise not to laugh?

19:00.806 --> 19:01.795
Of course.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.934
I've been thinking about you
ever since we met.

19:05.611 --> 19:09.012
That's funny, 'cause I've
been thinking of you, too.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.317
Very nice.

19:17.422 --> 19:19.822
Well, the best
is yet to come.

19:24.530 --> 19:28.830
Why don't you fix yourself a drink
and I'll make myself comfortable.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.298
Michael,
are you really certain...

20:03.368 --> 20:04.528
you want
to go through with this?

20:04.603 --> 20:05.900
KITT, if my hunch is right...

20:05.971 --> 20:07.336
the contacts
are somehow made...

20:07.406 --> 20:09.374
at the SI14 restaurant.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.133
And I gotta pass myself off...

20:11.210 --> 20:14.805
as one very hot piece
of space-age manpower.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.680
Then no question about it. The cover
I've given you should do exactly that.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.514
It's not the cover I'm worried
about, KITT, it's the knowledge.

20:21.587 --> 20:22.611
I need the words.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.747
Michael, you're asking
too much of yourself.

20:24.823 --> 20:28.452
You don't become a top scientist
overnight, much less in a couple of hours.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.620
You want the best advice
I can give you?

20:30.696 --> 20:33.164
I'm listening.
Say as little as possible.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.700
Thanks a lot!

20:42.774 --> 20:44.503
Mind if I join you?

20:45.477 --> 20:47.001
No, not at all.

20:47.145 --> 20:49.841
I couldn't help overhear your
conversation with the bartender...

20:49.915 --> 20:52.440
about needing
some R and R from work.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.677
Does your business
take you away from home a lot?

20:54.753 --> 20:56.687
Yeah, I'm afraid it does.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.086
Well, what do you do?

20:58.190 --> 21:00.158
I'm a nuclear physicist.

21:00.759 --> 21:04.320
I used to be engaged to a man once
in the space industry, Tom Johnson.

21:04.396 --> 21:05.693
You ever hear of him?

21:05.764 --> 21:07.823
Tom Johnson? No.

21:08.734 --> 21:11.066
What happened
to your engagement?

21:11.803 --> 21:15.330
Let's just say it's one of those
sad little stories I'd rather forget.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.642
Monica Brown.
Michael Knightwood.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.641
Dr. Michael Knightwood,
AlgoTech Industries.

21:21.713 --> 21:23.180
What do you do?

21:23.248 --> 21:26.547
Well, you might say I'm a hostess
at a place called the Retreat.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.642
Oh.

21:29.087 --> 21:30.816
Sounds interesting.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.924
We cater to
the scientific community.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.722
Maybe you'd like an invitation
to drop by sometime.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.990
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Dr. Knightwood.

21:39.064 --> 21:40.895
The pleasure was mine,
Ms. Brown.

21:58.016 --> 22:01.213
Keep a fix on Miss Congeniality, will
you, pal? We don't wanna lose her.

22:01.286 --> 22:03.550
I take it she didn't
buy your cover, Michael.

22:04.022 --> 22:07.321
She bought it. She just
wants time to check it out.

22:08.060 --> 22:11.723
I'd consider that substantial
progress. What's another day or so?

22:11.797 --> 22:13.822
We don't have a day or so.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.616
There's a high fence
surrounding the entire property.

22:36.688 --> 22:40.089
Of course, I could use my
microwave jammer to open that gate.

22:40.158 --> 22:42.149
See what you can find out
about this...

22:42.761 --> 22:44.023
Wait a minute.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.025
I think I've found
another way to get in.

22:49.401 --> 22:51.164
According to various
city records...

22:51.236 --> 22:54.364
this property is licensed
as a private hotel-spa...

22:54.439 --> 22:57.602
which appears to cater mostly to
members of the scientific community.

22:57.676 --> 23:00.873
It also appears to be an
entirely legitimate enterprise.

23:00.946 --> 23:04.382
Which only goes to prove
appearances can be deceiving.

23:05.684 --> 23:06.708
You ready?

23:06.785 --> 23:08.719
Ready, but hardly willing.

23:08.787 --> 23:10.755
Michael, what happened
to the good old days...

23:10.822 --> 23:14.485
when we simply turbo-boosted over
fences or crashed through walls?

23:14.559 --> 23:18.256
You said it yourself, partner, the
terrain is not suitable for turbo-boosting.

23:18.730 --> 23:23.224
You don't win friends and influence
people by crashing through their walls.

23:25.670 --> 23:28.696
Okay, let's grab the sun!

23:28.907 --> 23:30.067
Oh, my!

23:32.911 --> 23:34.003
Yeah!

23:42.654 --> 23:45.714
Faster, KITT. I need all
the altitude I can get.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.889
See you later, pal.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.054
Hold it right there.

24:57.729 --> 25:01.221
Hi. I was just looking
for the tennis courts.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.567
Do you know if they
rent rackets there, too?

25:30.495 --> 25:31.587
Wait!

25:32.898 --> 25:35.628
Monica. Dr. Knightwood,
remember?

25:36.601 --> 25:38.193
Is this him?
Yes.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.061
She said she'd be
in touch with you.

25:40.138 --> 25:41.901
Yes, I know, but...

25:42.073 --> 25:46.601
Well, she made the Retreat here sound so
peaceful and intellectually stimulating...

25:46.711 --> 25:50.408
that, well, I guess I got carried
away and followed her here.

25:50.482 --> 25:52.712
I'm kind of
the impatient kind.

25:52.951 --> 25:55.078
The impatient kind, huh?
Yes.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.155
You know what Einstein said
about mass and velocity.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.987
No, but it sounds interesting.
Tell me about it.

26:01.092 --> 26:02.753
Mass and velocity?

26:03.762 --> 26:06.060
It's very complicated,
and I'll tell you what...

26:06.131 --> 26:08.895
how about you and I discussing
mass and velocity over a drink?

26:08.967 --> 26:12.767
Dr. Knightwood, this is a private
retreat surrounded by a very high fence.

26:12.837 --> 26:14.236
How did you get in?

26:14.306 --> 26:16.501
I walked through
the front gate.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.738
That's impossible. The gate
only opens with a key card.

26:19.811 --> 26:23.110
Well, something's very wrong,
because the front gate is wide open.

26:24.015 --> 26:26.745
Really? We'll have to see
about that.

26:32.290 --> 26:34.554
I need you to open
the front gate real fast.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.861
I'm not sure I can do it from this
distance, Michael, but I'll try.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.056
Do it now.

26:55.547 --> 26:57.481
For your sake, Doctor,
I hope you're right.

27:08.493 --> 27:10.893
It's open.
That's what I told you.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.029
Veronica, have that fixed
immediately...

27:13.098 --> 27:16.033
and I want to know why he wasn't
picked up on the surveillance camera.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.193
Yes, Bianca.

27:18.003 --> 27:21.461
Well, as for you, Dr. Knightwood,
welcome to the Retreat.

27:21.539 --> 27:23.939
Thank you. The girls will
make you comfortable...

27:24.009 --> 27:28.605
and maybe later we'll have a chance for
that discussion on mass and velocity.

27:30.649 --> 27:31.946
Keep an eye on him.

27:34.219 --> 27:37.382
Stay out of sight, partner. The one
who attacked us on the road is here.

27:37.455 --> 27:38.479
You might be recognized.

27:38.556 --> 27:40.649
More important, Michael,
you might be recognized.

27:40.725 --> 27:42.488
Don't think
it hasn't crossed my mind.

27:43.361 --> 27:44.385
Coming, Doctor?

27:44.496 --> 27:46.464
Yes. Yes, I am.

27:51.236 --> 27:53.466
Oh, no.
Just what I don't need.

27:55.874 --> 27:58.434
All right, fur ball, scat.

27:58.543 --> 28:01.478
Go chase a mouse,
or better yet, a sardine.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.647
Well, we'll just
see about that!

28:09.254 --> 28:11.745
Oh, dear. That was
a tactical error.

28:14.059 --> 28:15.321
Oh, dear.

28:17.328 --> 28:18.989
Nice little kitty.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.525
Oh, no. Watch out.

28:23.268 --> 28:26.567
Get off of there. Oh, no,
don't push the turbo-boost!

28:39.050 --> 28:40.415
Seen enough?

28:40.485 --> 28:42.578
I don't think I understand.

28:44.122 --> 28:47.523
Come on, Ted.
You're an intelligent man.

28:48.293 --> 28:52.855
You've been around. You decided
to play the game and you lost.

28:54.032 --> 28:55.897
How many years
have you been married?

28:56.601 --> 28:58.501
Ten.
In October.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.067
October 2nd, to be exact.

29:01.139 --> 29:04.165
You have two daughters,
Mary Ann and Elizabeth...

29:04.242 --> 29:07.336
a dog named Bon-Bon,
and a parakeet named Lovey.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.575
Your wife bakes you chocolate
chip cookies every Friday...

29:10.648 --> 29:13.082
which you take with
a glass of warm milk to bed.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.076
Just what is it you want?

29:16.821 --> 29:18.015
The Pegasus missile.

29:19.891 --> 29:21.188
You're insane!

29:21.259 --> 29:23.659
And you're head of security
for Sendrax Industries...

29:23.728 --> 29:27.255
which is about to ship the
Pegasus to the testing grounds.

29:27.332 --> 29:30.699
But it'll never arrive, because
you're going to help us steal it.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.997
I can't.

29:32.837 --> 29:34.498
Of course you can.

29:34.973 --> 29:37.407
Because if you don't, your wife
is going to see that tape...

29:37.475 --> 29:39.500
and so are your daughters.

29:39.611 --> 29:43.672
And there'll be no more chocolate
chip cookies before going to bed.

29:44.582 --> 29:48.109
Tanya, I think Mr. Cooper
needs a glass of warm milk.

29:54.392 --> 29:55.484
Seymour!

29:56.728 --> 29:58.992
Are you sure you wouldn't
like to have a drink, Michael?

29:59.063 --> 30:01.156
No, thank you,
I never drink.

30:01.232 --> 30:04.065
I thought you wanted to have
some fun. Let yourself go.

30:04.135 --> 30:07.434
Maybe if you made yourself
a little more comfortable.

30:09.174 --> 30:11.369
Physicists are shy by nature.

30:20.084 --> 30:21.847
On second thought...

30:22.654 --> 30:25.452
last one in the spa
is a rotten pineapple.

30:33.264 --> 30:34.822
But you still have
your clothes on.

30:34.899 --> 30:35.923
Oh.

30:36.167 --> 30:39.068
Yeah. Now who's shy?

30:44.309 --> 30:46.334
Well, on second thought
here...

30:46.411 --> 30:49.574
I think I will go change
and wear a bathing suit.

30:49.881 --> 30:51.610
Keep the water wet.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.058
KITT?
I'm here, Michael.

31:08.333 --> 31:09.357
What was that?

31:09.434 --> 31:12.267
That is a very long story.
I'll tell you about it later.

31:12.737 --> 31:15.535
There's a man
in a light blue station wagon.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.442
I see him.
Check him out, will you?

31:22.513 --> 31:24.777
Anything in particular
you want me to look for?

31:24.849 --> 31:27.909
Yeah, I wanna find out what qualifies
him to be a member in the Retreat.

31:27.986 --> 31:29.544
I'll get right on it, Michael.

31:32.757 --> 31:33.849
And as for you...

31:35.326 --> 31:36.953
welcome to the Arctic.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.489
KITT, see if there's a safe...

32:14.565 --> 32:16.157
hidden in this room anywhere,
will you?

32:16.234 --> 32:17.292
Right away.

32:19.737 --> 32:21.898
There's one in the cabinet
behind you, Michael.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.645
All right, give me some amplification
on these tumblers, will you?

32:35.987 --> 32:37.614
If everything goes
as planned...

32:37.689 --> 32:39.782
we'll have both the missile
and the guidance system...

32:39.857 --> 32:41.552
just in time for delivery.

32:41.626 --> 32:42.991
Later, pal.

32:46.764 --> 32:49.324
What say we celebrate
with some champagne?

32:49.400 --> 32:50.560
Great.

33:09.087 --> 33:11.317
Don't worry, he won't.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.319
And how can you be so sure?

33:13.391 --> 33:17.054
Because I know men, Tanya.
A man's home is his castle.

33:25.303 --> 33:27.032
The real power
behind the throne.

33:34.512 --> 33:37.345
Nice kitty. Kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

33:38.082 --> 33:40.050
That's it. That's right.

33:50.762 --> 33:53.424
Come in, ladies.
Plenty of room for everyone.

33:53.498 --> 33:55.398
What are you
doing here?

33:55.633 --> 33:56.861
Soaking.

33:56.934 --> 33:58.128
I can see that.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.965
Isn't that
what a hot tub is for?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.562
Not my hot tub.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.934
Unless by special invitation.

34:06.811 --> 34:09.974
Well, like I said, I'm
kind of the impatient kind.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.440
Mass and velocity?

34:12.516 --> 34:13.505
That's right.

34:13.583 --> 34:16.553
You are something else,
Dr. Knightwood.

34:17.355 --> 34:19.219
Please, please,
call me Michael.

34:19.290 --> 34:22.885
But then I suppose one has to expect
a certain amount of arrogance...

34:22.960 --> 34:24.587
from a man of your brilliance.

34:24.661 --> 34:25.958
Well, I guess it's...

34:26.030 --> 34:28.293
I guess it's part of
the whole package.

34:29.634 --> 34:33.730
I have to admit
I do like the wrappings.

34:35.139 --> 34:38.597
But if you're lying to me,
if you're up to something...

34:39.577 --> 34:42.705
I'm going to make you
very sorry.

34:44.315 --> 34:46.215
Somehow, I believe you.

34:47.652 --> 34:50.449
Good. Now we can have
that drink together.

34:51.121 --> 34:53.022
But in the living room.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.090
Don't get up.

35:09.841 --> 35:13.902
I'm telling you, Bianca, except for the
glasses and the way that he's dressed...

35:13.978 --> 35:17.573
I'm almost positive it's the same man
who came to the aid of the courier.

35:17.648 --> 35:18.808
That's very interesting,
Tanya...

35:18.883 --> 35:22.683
but before I do anything, I have
to be sure that you're right.

35:27.525 --> 35:30.517
Dr. Knightwood. Feel better?

35:30.595 --> 35:32.153
Like a new man.
Good.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.027
Please, call me Michael.
I'd like that.

35:34.098 --> 35:36.225
Thank you.
Wanna come sit over here?

35:36.300 --> 35:38.063
Yes, thank you.
Good.

35:39.170 --> 35:43.129
Maybe you'd feel even more comfortable,
Michael, without your glasses.

35:43.207 --> 35:45.641
I don't see very well
without them.

35:47.778 --> 35:49.370
Just as I thought.
It's window glass.

35:52.450 --> 35:53.576
Don't kill him!

35:57.088 --> 35:59.113
I wanna see
what he knows first.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.082
What a pity, Michael.

36:01.159 --> 36:04.526
I was looking forward to that
lecture on mass and velocity.

36:12.703 --> 36:16.469
Michael, you have no idea
how much this hurts me.

36:16.607 --> 36:19.041
Why don't we change places?

36:19.644 --> 36:23.637
But that's just it. There's no need
for either one of us to be here.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.541
All I really wanna know
is who you are.

36:32.557 --> 36:34.525
I told you my name is...

36:35.359 --> 36:37.418
Dr. Michael Knightwood.

36:38.062 --> 36:40.758
I work for AlgoTech
Industries.

36:41.065 --> 36:43.363
I'm sure you had me
checked out.

36:43.568 --> 36:47.527
A computer is only as trustworthy
as the information fed into it.

36:47.972 --> 36:51.772
No, I'm sure you work for one
of the law enforcement agencies.

36:51.909 --> 36:55.003
The only thing is
I don't really care which one.

36:55.146 --> 36:57.114
The only thing
I want to know is...

36:57.181 --> 36:58.739
can I get away with it?

36:59.550 --> 37:01.040
You haven't got a chance.

37:02.186 --> 37:03.312
Then they know.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.547
Everything.

37:04.622 --> 37:05.748
No, Michael.

37:05.823 --> 37:08.986
If they knew everything, they'd be
here breaking down the doors right now.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.757
My guess is they sent you here on your
own to see what you could find out.

37:12.830 --> 37:15.924
I'm telling you,
they know everything.

37:16.601 --> 37:19.866
All you have to do is tell me
what I'm after, Michael.

37:19.937 --> 37:22.838
What is it, Michael?
Can I get away with it?

37:25.876 --> 37:27.639
Michael, what is it?

37:34.352 --> 37:36.445
He has no idea
what we're after.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.978
Which means once we hear
from Cooper, we can go get it.

37:42.526 --> 37:43.754
Come on.

37:45.396 --> 37:48.229
KITT, I'm a little concerned about
Michael. Have you heard from him?

37:48.299 --> 37:49.960
Not for a couple of hours,
Devon.

37:50.034 --> 37:53.595
I tried making contact with him on the
comm link, but there was no response.

37:53.671 --> 37:56.333
Is it possible there's some sort
of interference with the signal?

37:56.407 --> 37:58.568
I thought of that, Bonnie,
but I couldn't find any.

37:58.643 --> 38:01.271
I did notice sudden surges
of electrical current...

38:01.345 --> 38:03.870
but I wasn't able to isolate
where they were coming from.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.143
Of course, there is
one other possibility.

38:06.217 --> 38:08.685
What is that?
The lady of the Retreat.

38:08.753 --> 38:10.084
She's quite attractive.

38:10.154 --> 38:12.384
Of course, knowing Michael
the way I do, Devon...

38:12.456 --> 38:14.424
it would strictly be
in the line of duty.

38:14.492 --> 38:16.483
Yes, in the line of duty.

38:16.727 --> 38:19.924
Well, we'll wait a little
longer and see what happens.

38:19.997 --> 38:21.021
One more thing.

38:21.098 --> 38:23.658
Michael had me check out one
of the guests at the resort.

38:23.734 --> 38:25.793
I learned his name
is Theodore Cooper.

38:25.870 --> 38:28.532
He's head of security
at Sendrax Industries.

38:28.606 --> 38:31.439
Good work, KITT.
I'll get on it right away.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.337
Hello?

38:36.447 --> 38:37.675
It's me, Ted.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.446
Do you have the information?

38:39.784 --> 38:42.344
Yes. Bianca, listen...

38:42.586 --> 38:43.951
Just give it to me.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.027
It left in an unmarked truck
about 15 minutes ago.

38:52.630 --> 38:53.722
Good.

38:55.299 --> 38:57.324
All right.
Yes, I got that.

38:58.669 --> 39:01.968
Thank you, Ted. I'm glad we
could help each other out.

39:02.239 --> 39:03.604
When do I get my tape?

39:03.674 --> 39:06.939
When? Why, when I have
no further use for you.

39:08.713 --> 39:12.774
Well, I'll be in touch, darling,
and say hello to wifey for me, okay?

39:15.986 --> 39:19.547
Well, it's already on its way.
We just have to move fast.

39:20.057 --> 39:21.217
What about...

39:22.326 --> 39:25.318
You found him, Monica.
You can get rid of him.

39:25.429 --> 39:27.329
No problem.
Great.

39:27.398 --> 39:28.990
Let's go, girls.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.442
Such a waste.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.451
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

40:26.824 --> 40:27.848
KITT, come pick me up.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.414
I just saw that lady leaving
with two of her friends.

40:50.481 --> 40:52.142
Which way are they headed?

40:52.216 --> 40:53.808
They turned north
on Stockton Road...

40:53.884 --> 40:56.079
then disappeared
from my scanner range.

41:10.768 --> 41:13.100
Michael, Devon is calling.

41:13.604 --> 41:14.832
Devon.

41:14.905 --> 41:17.465
Michael, I'm relieved
to see that you're safe.

41:17.541 --> 41:20.408
Yeah, I feel better about
it, too. What have you got?

41:20.478 --> 41:24.141
A Pegasus missile is en route from
Sendrax Industries to the proving grounds.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.910
It's what is known as
a smart missile...

41:25.983 --> 41:27.007
because of its ability...

41:27.084 --> 41:30.781
to launch multiple warheads and
then return to its launching site.

41:30.855 --> 41:32.254
Sounds impressive.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.223
Yes, at the very least.

41:34.525 --> 41:38.291
The only thing is it's practically
useless without its guidance system.

41:38.362 --> 41:41.263
You mean Dr. Freeman's
micro guidance system.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.560
Exactly.

41:42.633 --> 41:46.194
And my guess is that whoever has
that will now go after the Pegasus.

41:46.270 --> 41:48.363
It's a very educated guess.

41:48.639 --> 41:51.301
Bonnie, do you have the
information about the delivery?

41:51.375 --> 41:53.900
I'm programming it
into KITT's CRT now.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.445
All right, I'll be in touch.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.105
If the truck
carrying the Pegasus...

41:57.181 --> 41:59.206
is traveling at its
prescribed speed, Michael...

41:59.283 --> 42:01.911
we should be exactly
25.7 miles from it.

42:01.986 --> 42:04.420
All right, pal,
let's step on it.

42:23.674 --> 42:25.164
Are you going our way, boys?

42:26.110 --> 42:28.601
Too bad, we could have
had some fun.

42:40.958 --> 42:43.654
Good girl, Tanya.
Now for the missile.

42:55.239 --> 42:57.503
KITT, can you pick up
the truck on your scanner?

42:57.575 --> 42:59.634
Negative, Michael.
It's still out of range...

42:59.710 --> 43:02.338
but we'll be coming up
to Stone Mountain Road soon.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.880
Can't be soon enough.

43:46.056 --> 43:47.353
Michael.

43:47.424 --> 43:49.984
No question about it,
they've been here.

43:50.060 --> 43:51.994
The guards appear
to be all right.

44:08.545 --> 44:10.479
I have the truck
in scanner range, Michael.

44:10.547 --> 44:12.879
I see it!
Now let's go get it.

44:19.623 --> 44:21.250
Where does
that other road go?

44:21.325 --> 44:24.817
It dead-ends 100 yards from here,
just above the truck's route.

44:24.895 --> 44:26.624
Right. Got an idea.

44:31.468 --> 44:33.197
Michael, you're playing
with suicide.

44:33.270 --> 44:35.534
Suicide is letting them
get away with that missile.

44:37.908 --> 44:39.808
All right. Let's do it!

44:44.181 --> 44:45.671
What was that?

44:46.984 --> 44:48.508
Nothing I can't get rid of.

44:51.889 --> 44:53.720
KITT, get down here, buddy.

44:53.857 --> 44:55.722
Right away, Michael.

45:26.824 --> 45:28.519
KITT, the four-wheeler.

45:28.592 --> 45:30.184
Leave that to me, Michael.

45:30.260 --> 45:32.228
Don't forget about
the Tufflex bullets.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.372
Hello. It's all over.

46:17.341 --> 46:19.605
Michael, the four-by-four
is under control.

46:22.079 --> 46:24.172
Right behind you, buddy.

46:33.423 --> 46:34.685
Good work, buddy.

46:34.792 --> 46:35.918
Thank you, Michael.

46:38.962 --> 46:42.523
Hello, Bianca. I told you,
you couldn't get away with it.

46:42.733 --> 46:46.032
Now, about
mass and velocity.

46:55.379 --> 46:59.509
I guess you were right all along,
Michael. My idol had feet of clay.

47:00.217 --> 47:02.583
I don't think you can
judge him too harshly.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.177
Harley was a lonely man...

47:04.254 --> 47:07.849
who fell into the clutches of a
very beautiful and very evil woman.

47:07.925 --> 47:11.326
I think the worst you can
accuse him of is being human.

47:11.395 --> 47:14.193
Thank you. So this is
the Retreat, huh?

47:14.331 --> 47:16.822
Was. Past tense.
It's all over now.

47:17.634 --> 47:19.795
But it was great
while it lasted, huh?

47:19.870 --> 47:20.894
Come on, Bonnie.

47:20.971 --> 47:24.463
What's so great about beautiful
women running around in bikinis...

47:24.541 --> 47:26.668
catering to your every need?

47:26.910 --> 47:30.311
I don't know. You tell me.
You got a couple hours?

47:39.656 --> 47:42.386
Oh, no, I thought
they arrested her, too.

47:42.459 --> 47:45.690
Wrong, buddy. The authorities have
found a brand-new home for her.

47:45.762 --> 47:47.730
Just so it's far away from me.

47:47.798 --> 47:51.165
Actually, the Foundation was
thinking of adopting Sheeba as a pet.

47:51.235 --> 47:52.361
You have to be kidding.

47:52.436 --> 47:54.870
Hey! We have a KITT,
why not have a cat?

47:56.373 --> 47:58.671
Very funny, Michael,
very funny.
