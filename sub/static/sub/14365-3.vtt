00:00.123 --> 00:03.472
<i>Previously on Transformers Prime...</i>

00:03.473 --> 00:06.502
With the power of the Matrix
no longer within him...

00:06.503 --> 00:11.913
it would stand to reason that Optimus
has reverted to his pre-Prime state.

00:11.914 --> 00:13.698
A high-frequency signal...

00:13.699 --> 00:15.483
with an embedded message.

00:15.484 --> 00:16.982
Where is Optimus?

00:16.983 --> 00:20.053
Unless you know where Megatron
is hiding his Space-bridge...

00:20.054 --> 00:21.692
Space-bridge!

00:21.693 --> 00:25.323
They actually finished building it
without my supervision?!

00:25.324 --> 00:28.832
Once we secure the Space-bridge
we'll send for Jack.

00:28.833 --> 00:32.732
You three need to hold it long enough for
Jack and me to get to Cybertron and back.

00:32.734 --> 00:37.242
How could I possibly be "Optimus Prime"?

00:37.243 --> 00:40.973
Vector Sigma's true location
shrouded in myth and rumour, Jack.

00:40.974 --> 00:44.283
It is said the path of the Primes
leads there.

00:48.819 --> 00:52.089

We must be close.

02:15.939 --> 02:17.742
Vector Sigma is... down here?

02:17.743 --> 02:22.034
Kaon didn't always belong to the Decepticons.
Megatron took it as a capital.

02:22.304 --> 02:25.873
Apparently without ever realising
what lay beneath their feet.

Arcee!  ****1****  ok

03:55.633 --> 03:57.062
We are being attacked by some
kind of...

03:57.130 --> 03:58.773
<i>giant bug-beetle!</i>

03:58.774 --> 04:01.112
- An Insecticon!
- A what?

04:01.113 --> 04:03.442
What are Decepticons doing on Cybertron?

04:03.443 --> 04:08.653
A few remained in stasis.
Sentries, should the... enemy return.

04:20.183 --> 04:21.373
Jack! Go!

04:21.382 --> 04:22.953
Seriously?

04:23.353 --> 04:25.452
Without Arcee? 
She's his guide!

04:25.453 --> 04:28.423
No, nurse Darby, Arcee is Jack's backup.

04:28.453 --> 04:30.953
The Key-Card is his guide.

04:36.133 --> 04:37.373
Do it!

04:37.503 --> 04:38.563
<i>Listen to her, Jack.</i>

04:38.564 --> 04:41.743
You've made it this far.
Optimus is counting on you.

04:45.813 --> 04:46.543
Roger that, mom.

04:58.753 --> 05:00.293
<i>Orion!</i>

05:00.303 --> 05:03.163
Have you made progess with project "Iacon"?

05:04.733 --> 05:07.833
It seems I am a bit rustier than I thought.

05:08.463 --> 05:13.273
Might that have anything to do
with the nature of your after-hours research?

05:14.603 --> 05:18.873
Did I fail to mention that we
will be tracking your activities?

05:25.353 --> 05:28.653
Why does history portray me
siding with the Autobot aggressors?

05:28.983 --> 05:31.553
And why did Starscream 
call me a Prime?

05:32.453 --> 05:36.693
I must know! Who am I?

05:36.733 --> 05:41.663
You are my clerk. Now get back
to work and decode that database.

05:45.133 --> 05:48.306
No. I would rather erase my
findings

05:48.427 --> 05:51.773
than make them available
for your questionable use.

06:10.293 --> 06:14.355
Did you really think that we
wouldn't be tracking and documenting

06:14.356 --> 06:17.063
every iota of your invaluable
research?

06:23.533 --> 06:27.043
One of our sentries was activated...
on Cybertron?

06:27.513 --> 06:30.263
You told me our planet was dead.

06:30.264 --> 06:33.013
That is beside the point. 
Guards!

06:33.383 --> 06:36.257
You will finish project
"Iacon" by the time I return

06:36.484 --> 06:41.723
or I will carve out your
Spark before your very eyes!

08:10.613 --> 08:17.183
The activity log indicates my Space-bridge
was set for Cybertron... and remains open? ****2**** ok

08:17.713 --> 08:21.453
The only possible reason the
Autobots would take such a risk...

08:22.083 --> 08:25.353
<i>...would be to restore
their precious Optimus Prime.</i>

08:55.753 --> 08:57.823
Everyone! I'm in.

08:58.853 --> 09:00.023
Sweet!

10:08.853 --> 10:11.923
This is... 
Wow.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.633
Commencing download...
I think.

10:20.833 --> 10:22.503
Soon, Optimus.

10:23.103 --> 10:25.303
No one told you to stop, Pax.

10:31.413 --> 10:36.813
I believe Megatron intends to use whatever he
finds on project "Iacon" to harm the Autobots.

10:37.713 --> 10:40.583
Please. We can warn them.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.233
This is taking a while.

10:57.873 --> 11:02.173
<i>Of course it is. We are talking about
the collective wisdom of the Primes.</i>

11:31.333 --> 11:32.103
<i>What is it, Jack?</i>

11:32.104 --> 11:34.102
Scraplets!

11:34.103 --> 11:35.473
What's a scraplet?

11:36.273 --> 11:38.073
Why did it have to be scraplets?!

11:38.473 --> 11:42.303
If they chew through Vector Sigma
before the Matrix fully reloads...

11:42.313 --> 11:46.183
So Vector Sigma IS 
more than legend.

11:52.353 --> 11:55.393
You Autobots have gone to impressive
lengths to recover your Leader.

11:55.663 --> 12:00.793
Be assured,
I shall never underestimate you again.

12:03.003 --> 12:08.727
Now... I assume the one called Arcee
will be stepping through that portal... ****3****

12:08.728 --> 12:12.543
with the reloaded 
Matrix of Leadership in hand.

12:12.544 --> 12:16.213
We hold the Space-bridge at all costs!

12:43.003 --> 12:44.803
You're going down, Bucket-head!

13:03.293 --> 13:04.293
Jack?

13:23.973 --> 13:26.783
Oh no-no-no-no, 
don't quit now!

13:30.852 --> 13:32.070
Arcee?

13:42.193 --> 13:44.363
Back off, bug!

13:53.473 --> 13:56.573
Hey, guys! 
The main course!

15:02.903 --> 15:04.643
I have the Matrix.

15:06.365 --> 15:07.917
Let's roll.

15:26.993 --> 15:32.933
<i>You have to admit, it's a privilege to
stomp a former leader of the Autobots.</i>

15:45.213 --> 15:50.683
No, please... stop.
Enough!

15:52.053 --> 15:54.723
I'm...
I'm armed?

16:14.773 --> 16:16.173
We're almost there. ****3,5**** 16,14,650

16:16.713 --> 16:19.843
Ratchet, we have the Matrix.
We're coming through.

16:22.403 --> 16:24.433
Ratchet?

16:29.703 --> 16:32.673
Something's wrong.

16:43.233 --> 16:46.343
We can't knuckle through, can we?

16:47.873 --> 16:54.443
Come, Arcee. So that I might end
the lineage of the Primes for all time.

16:55.543 --> 16:58.013
I cannot allow that to happen, Megatron.

17:03.623 --> 17:07.593
And why should you care, Orion Pax?
You are no Prime.

17:07.963 --> 17:13.163
That may be true. Or yet another deception?
But this much I do know:

17:13.762 --> 17:18.772
My sympathies lie with the Autobots
and you are not one of us.

17:29.683 --> 17:32.183
Your Spark may be at the right place, Orion.

17:35.683 --> 17:39.953
But you have much to learn before you can hope
to ever again stand your ground against me.

17:40.323 --> 17:44.023
A moment, sadly,
which shall never come.

18:01.743 --> 18:05.653
Are you... certain I'm worthy?

18:05.654 --> 18:07.883
You have no idea.

18:21.753 --> 18:24.385
How nice of you to
join our tender reunion.

18:24.720 --> 18:29.033
Now, if you please... the Matrix?!

19:00.573 --> 19:02.333
Noo!

19:04.143 --> 19:06.303
Megatron...

19:08.273 --> 19:10.173
Be gone!

19:26.463 --> 19:29.533
Ratchet! 
How did we arrive here?

19:29.534 --> 19:31.132
Long story, old friend.

19:31.133 --> 19:32.533
<i>Base to Arcee!</i>

19:32.534 --> 19:36.733
We're reading five Autobot life signals
down there. Is Prime with you?

19:36.833 --> 19:37.703
<i>And Jack.</i>

19:37.704 --> 19:39.003
Yes!

19:49.513 --> 19:50.683
It's ours!

19:51.253 --> 19:53.553
Autobots, fall back!

19:58.623 --> 20:01.523
This time he's coming with us.

20:14.733 --> 20:17.451
Nooo!

20:30.553 --> 20:31.193
Jack!

20:48.903 --> 20:50.173
Optimus?

20:51.273 --> 20:52.772
Hello, Rafael.

20:52.773 --> 20:56.443
- Wooow.
- The Big Guy remembers us! Woo-hoo!

20:59.853 --> 21:03.453
Although it seems
there is much I do not remember.

21:03.454 --> 21:07.422
Optimus,
it has truly been our darkest hour.

21:07.423 --> 21:09.731
But know this:

21:09.850 --> 21:16.733
From every indication your Spark
never ceased being that of an Autobot.
