00:05.386 --> 00:08.469
STAN: 'Twas Christmas at last,
the best time of year.

00:08.469 --> 00:11.132
So here is a story
of good family cheer.

00:11.132 --> 00:13.514
It's a wonderful tale
and I'm not over-hyping.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.057
Hey! Who is that breathing
on me while I'm typing?

00:16.057 --> 00:18.099
Aaah!

00:18.099 --> 00:20.020
Are you telling the story

00:20.020 --> 00:21.902
of how you stole Christmas
this year?

00:21.902 --> 00:23.023
I call it the story

00:23.023 --> 00:25.146
of how I saved Christmas
this year.

00:25.146 --> 00:26.777
Hey, I can call you Jose,

00:26.777 --> 00:29.650
but that doesn't make it
your name.

00:29.650 --> 00:32.032
If I let you call me Jose,
can I tell my story?

00:32.032 --> 00:34.075
No way, Jose.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.326
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.118
Proceed, Jose.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.560
On Christmas Eve day,
the kids scurried around,

00:59.560 --> 01:02.353
inspecting their gifts that sat
wrapped on the ground.

01:02.353 --> 01:05.446
They prodded and poked them
and hoped they weren't junky.

01:05.446 --> 01:08.189
Tyler shook his around
like a less clever monkey.

01:10.401 --> 01:13.073
Guys, Christmas
isn't about presents.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.196
It's about being together.

01:15.196 --> 01:18.159
This one looks exactly
like the right size
to be my game system.

01:18.159 --> 01:21.202
Oh, man, hen I play it,
my eyes burn, my fingers bleed,

01:21.202 --> 01:23.124
and my whole body
twitches involuntarily.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.755
I can't wait.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.550
Come on.
Let's do something as a family.

01:29.550 --> 01:33.214
( gasps )
I bet this is the new tablet
I've been dropping hints about.

01:33.214 --> 01:35.095
Wouldn't it be funny

01:35.095 --> 01:37.558
if Mom thought you wanted
a tablet of paper

01:37.558 --> 01:40.271
instead
of a tablet computer?

01:41.482 --> 01:42.683
No.

01:42.683 --> 01:44.485
No, Tyler,
it would not be funny.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.570
You guys are missing
the meaning of Christmas.

01:49.570 --> 01:52.943
This better be the cell phone
I asked Mommy and Daddy for,

01:52.943 --> 01:54.615
'cause I'm tired of having
nothing in my phone case

01:54.615 --> 01:56.237
except a can of sardines.

01:58.739 --> 02:00.621
Stop that.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.122
Stop shaking
your presents

02:02.122 --> 02:03.954
to find out
what's in there, huh?

02:03.954 --> 02:06.046
What is wrong with you kids?

02:06.046 --> 02:07.958
You got to hold them
up to the light.

02:09.670 --> 02:12.173
Bennett,
what are you teaching the kids?

02:12.173 --> 02:13.674
You need to steam
the tape off.

02:17.468 --> 02:19.059
What are we doing?
You know what?

02:19.059 --> 02:20.561
We're not gonna find out
until tonight

02:20.561 --> 02:22.683
when we each
open one family gift.

02:22.683 --> 02:25.105
In the meantime,
you all promised to help me

02:25.105 --> 02:26.647
make Christmas Eve dinner,

02:26.647 --> 02:28.269
which does not count
as a gift,

02:28.269 --> 02:30.070
even if you give it to me
in the form of a coupon.

02:34.235 --> 02:38.199
As long as your present to me
is the multi-tool I asked for.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.411
It has a hundred
different functions,

02:40.411 --> 02:42.283
and none of them
are necktie.

02:42.283 --> 02:45.496
I work at home. Why do people
keep getting me neckties?

02:49.049 --> 02:51.131
( glass breaks )

02:51.131 --> 02:53.254
I may have picked up
the wrong box.

02:57.218 --> 03:00.261
Guys, come on already.
Put down the presents.

03:00.261 --> 03:01.892
I don't like
where this is going.

03:01.892 --> 03:03.183
When you open them,

03:03.183 --> 03:05.185
you're gonna disappear
just like last year.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.228
You remember last year.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.270
At least,
you didn't just run off

03:09.270 --> 03:11.402
to play with your new virtual
reality helmet.

03:11.402 --> 03:12.443
Right, Robert?

03:14.615 --> 03:16.407
Robert,
will you take that off

03:16.407 --> 03:18.279
so we can enjoy
some Christmas cheer?

03:18.279 --> 03:20.581
No, you are not
too busy battling orcs

03:20.581 --> 03:22.243
with your elfin army.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.535
Yes, I know it's immersive,

03:24.535 --> 03:25.706
but you have to be able

03:25.706 --> 03:27.998
to distinguish reality
from fantasy,

03:27.998 --> 03:29.630
my stuffed orange friend!

03:32.172 --> 03:34.965
There's other Christmas things
to do besides presents.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.297
We can sing carols,

03:36.297 --> 03:38.218
string popcorn.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.011
I'm standing
under this mistletoe

03:41.011 --> 03:44.144
(sing-songy)
all al-o-o-o-ne.

03:46.146 --> 03:48.439
That stuff is so lame, Stan.

03:48.439 --> 03:50.351
Christmas is
all about the presents.

03:50.351 --> 03:51.852
Don't be such a Grinch.

03:51.852 --> 03:53.193
STAN: To make them
love Christmas,

03:53.193 --> 03:54.855
I'd have to get rough.

03:54.855 --> 03:57.948
If they wanted a Grinch,
then I'd steal all their stuff.

03:57.948 --> 04:01.121
I'd hide all their presents
in some secret place,

04:01.121 --> 04:04.034
just like the Grinch
with a much cuter face.

04:07.828 --> 04:09.209
Ellen, look.

04:09.209 --> 04:11.211
I picked up the trampoline
we're giving the kids tomorrow.

04:11.211 --> 04:14.295
I pictured it being
more trampoline shaped.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.797
Well, I have
to put it together.

04:16.797 --> 04:18.929
You didn't pay
to have it assembled?

04:18.929 --> 04:21.261
You mean
pay the laziness tax?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.093
Uh-uh.
I don't think so.

04:23.093 --> 04:25.225
I'm not giving
someone 50 bucks

04:25.225 --> 04:27.227
to snap a couple
of springs together.

04:30.230 --> 04:31.442
Doesn't matter.

04:31.442 --> 04:33.273
They're not gonna get me.
No, no, no, no!

04:33.273 --> 04:36.527
Oh!
And here is the nut bag.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.699
Yeah,
that's the nut bag.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.403
You're always doing
that joke on me,

04:42.403 --> 04:44.244
but I finally got you.

04:44.244 --> 04:47.167
Boom! I got you!
I got you!

04:47.167 --> 04:49.289
I got you
with your own joke!

04:49.289 --> 04:50.501
Ssss...burn you.

04:50.501 --> 04:51.622
Ssss...burn you.

04:51.622 --> 04:53.674
Sss...you.

04:56.256 --> 04:58.128
Yeah, I'm the nut bag.

04:59.179 --> 05:00.260
Dang it!

05:08.689 --> 05:11.482
Noooo!!!

05:11.482 --> 05:13.894
Avery! Tyler!

05:13.894 --> 05:15.736
Chloe, are you okay?

05:15.736 --> 05:16.937
No!

05:16.937 --> 05:19.199
The presents are gone.
Nothing's okay.

05:19.199 --> 05:20.901
Nothing will
ever be okay again.

05:20.901 --> 05:23.113
I've lost my childhood!

05:25.155 --> 05:27.077
The presents are gone.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.501
ALL: Nooooo!!!!

05:31.542 --> 05:35.005
I heard your cries of joy.

05:35.005 --> 05:37.087
I gave you
the best gift of all.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.961
I stole all your presents.
Merry Christmas!

05:42.262 --> 05:43.384
ALL: What?!

05:43.384 --> 05:46.226
Oh, you're right.
Happy Holidays.

05:48.018 --> 05:50.811
Stan, why would you take
our presents?

05:50.811 --> 05:53.894
Christmas is about
being together as a family

05:53.894 --> 05:55.776
and the presents were just
getting in the way of that.

05:55.776 --> 05:57.818
So I hid them.

05:57.818 --> 06:01.482
Look at you, feeling the warmth
of the season.

06:01.482 --> 06:03.193
Coming in for a hug.

06:03.193 --> 06:05.746
Your eyes are so shiny

06:05.746 --> 06:07.658
and kind of scary.

06:09.830 --> 06:12.833
Stan, where did you
put the presents?

06:12.833 --> 06:14.665
Ah! Funny story.

06:14.665 --> 06:17.047
I buried them
and forgot where.

06:17.047 --> 06:19.339
( laughs )

06:19.339 --> 06:21.211
It's not funny now,

06:21.211 --> 06:22.843
but this is going to be
one of those stories

06:22.843 --> 06:26.216
that we will look back on
and laugh.

06:26.216 --> 06:27.678
( laughing )

06:29.059 --> 06:32.352
See?
We are laughing.

06:33.854 --> 06:35.015
I'm not laughing.

06:35.015 --> 06:36.186
How about now?

06:42.613 --> 06:44.194
Are you made of stone?

06:46.366 --> 06:48.789
Stan,
you lost our presents?

06:48.789 --> 06:50.741
When Mom and Dad see
that the presents are gone,

06:50.741 --> 06:51.872
they're going to freak.

06:51.872 --> 06:53.333
It'll totally
ruin Christmas.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.665
We need to find
the presents

06:54.665 --> 06:56.747
before Mom and Dad
notice they're missing.

06:56.747 --> 07:00.170
Stan, think.
Where did you bury them?

07:00.170 --> 07:03.173
STAN: We had to retrieve
all the presents and fast

07:03.173 --> 07:05.886
or I worried
this holiday might be my last.

07:05.886 --> 07:08.889
And if you think that sounds
like an exaggeration,

07:08.889 --> 07:11.762
why don't you take a crack
at this rhyming narration?

07:13.684 --> 07:15.726
Do you think
he's thinking about it?

07:15.726 --> 07:18.108
He's just staring off
into space.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.235
It may not be too late

07:25.235 --> 07:26.907
to pay someone
to assemble a trampoline.

07:26.907 --> 07:28.529
I don't need
to pay someone.

07:28.529 --> 07:30.030
I know a thing
or two about tools.

07:33.624 --> 07:37.077
For example,
that is not a twirling wrench.

07:37.077 --> 07:38.248
Well, I can't help you.

07:38.248 --> 07:39.710
I'm gonna be busy
all day with dinner.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.632
You're gonna be completely
on your own.

07:41.632 --> 07:43.083
Please, Ellen.

07:43.083 --> 07:46.637
Stupid people all over the world
build trampolines every day.

07:46.637 --> 07:48.138
I think I can do this.

07:50.931 --> 07:53.053
Whoa! Ohh!

07:53.053 --> 07:57.518
Oh! I owe a lot of stupid people
an apology.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.272
STAN: I remember
I buried the presents

08:02.272 --> 08:04.364
somewhere at the park...

08:04.364 --> 08:06.737
It says the park is closed
for a private event.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.699
Why would all these people
be at the park for Christmas?

08:08.699 --> 08:11.241
Different cultures
have different customs, I guess.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.282
Oh, you mean
like the way

08:12.282 --> 08:13.824
my people spend
so much time on their hair?

08:13.824 --> 08:16.416
They're not your people,
they're girls.

08:18.378 --> 08:20.420
Look, Stan,
we need to get the presents.

08:20.420 --> 08:22.502
While Chloe's
home cooking with Mom,

08:22.502 --> 08:25.215
we're going to have to dig
as inconspicuously as possible

08:25.215 --> 08:26.336
with all these
people here.

08:26.336 --> 08:28.128
So where did you
bury them?

08:28.128 --> 08:31.261
I'm not sure,
but I remember a snowman.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.763
Over there.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.766
Hold it right there.

08:35.766 --> 08:37.187
You can't just show up

08:37.187 --> 08:39.269
at a McCorkin
family Christmas party

08:39.269 --> 08:41.942
without getting a hug
from Big Ivan.

08:42.983 --> 08:44.605
Come over here, Big Ivan.

08:48.148 --> 08:49.740
They think
we're part of the family.

08:49.740 --> 08:51.201
We are part of the family

08:51.201 --> 08:52.412
or we'll get kicked
out of the park

08:52.412 --> 08:53.954
before we have a chance
to find the presents.

08:53.954 --> 08:56.577
Well, it was
great to see you.

08:56.577 --> 08:59.209
We're gonna go mingle
and catch up with
the rest of the McKirkles.

08:59.209 --> 09:00.210
McCorkins.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.122
Ohh! McAnkles.

09:02.122 --> 09:05.586
You know, I don't remember you
from last Christmas.

09:05.586 --> 09:09.299
We didn't make it last year.
We're actually from out of town.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.092
You look like cousin Ruth
from Nova Scotia.

09:12.092 --> 09:14.224
Oh, I haven't seen her
in years.

09:14.224 --> 09:16.056
That's right.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.098
Here all the way
from Nova Scotia.

09:18.098 --> 09:20.390
I am Ruth.
She's 80.

09:20.390 --> 09:22.683
Not that Ruth.
I'm her granddaughter Ruth.

09:22.683 --> 09:24.104
We're all named Ruth.
Right, Ruth?

09:24.104 --> 09:25.816
Don't ask me.
I'm still rubbing McAnkles.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.147
You McKicked me hard.

09:28.108 --> 09:30.190
What are you guys
talking about?

09:30.190 --> 09:32.492
Ah, pfft!
We're just kiddin' around.

09:32.492 --> 09:35.075
Yeah, it's just the old
McCrackle sense of humor.
McCorkin.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.197
Right, the McCrackle
sense of McCorkin.
You know what I mean.

09:37.197 --> 09:40.040
Can someone give me
an ice pack or something?

09:40.040 --> 09:42.663
STAN: How much they lied,
there's really no telling.

09:42.663 --> 09:45.375
Chloe, meanwhile,
mashed taters with Ellen.

09:45.375 --> 09:47.207
Mmm, those potatoes
look great.

09:47.207 --> 09:48.338
I'll go get Tyler

09:48.338 --> 09:49.920
so he can start
his green bean casserole.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.302
No!
It's too soon.

09:52.302 --> 09:54.054
It's never too soon
for green beans.

09:56.136 --> 09:58.218
Oh, no!

09:58.218 --> 10:01.021
Now I have to start
all over again.

10:01.021 --> 10:04.274
Well, one good thing
about having a dog in the family

10:04.274 --> 10:05.896
is he eats the food
off the floor.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.277
Stan!
No!

10:07.277 --> 10:10.070
You don't need
Stan for that.

10:10.070 --> 10:12.402
Not when you have
a little girl.

10:17.447 --> 10:19.870
Not off the--

10:19.870 --> 10:21.121
All right,
just eat the top layer

10:21.121 --> 10:22.042
that didn't touch the floor.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.295
And use a spoon like a lady.

10:26.707 --> 10:28.128
Hey.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.881
I just came in
because I need a tool

10:30.881 --> 10:33.253
for that thing
I'm working on out back.

10:33.253 --> 10:35.595
If only
I had a multi-tool...

10:35.595 --> 10:37.848
Bennett, you're not opening
your present early.

10:37.848 --> 10:39.599
But it has
a trampoline wrench!

10:39.599 --> 10:40.721
I mean,
how many trampolines

10:40.721 --> 10:41.852
am I going to build
in a lifetime?

10:41.852 --> 10:43.023
This could be it for me!

10:44.314 --> 10:46.817
No, you can't open
your present early,

10:46.817 --> 10:48.689
just like I can't open
my foot spa,

10:48.689 --> 10:49.980
if that's what
you got me,

10:49.980 --> 10:52.192
and it better be, some stores
are still open.

10:52.192 --> 10:54.274
All right, fine.

10:54.274 --> 10:56.036
I'll just use my boring,
separate pliers

10:56.036 --> 10:58.158
that only do one thing:
plying.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.990
Woo-hoo.

10:59.990 --> 11:02.993
Bennett,
don't be a plier hater.

11:02.993 --> 11:05.665
Wow.
Yeah, that's what
it's come to.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.168
I think I might have left them
by the Christmas tree.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.290
The Christmas tree?

11:10.290 --> 11:12.382
Wa-a-a-a-a-a-it!

11:15.095 --> 11:17.097
Let's play a game!

11:17.097 --> 11:18.058
Chloe, I can't see.

11:18.058 --> 11:19.760
This is the game.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.391
I'll guide you
to your pliers.

11:21.391 --> 11:23.393
Go straight.

11:23.393 --> 11:25.936
Oh! Ow!

11:25.936 --> 11:27.898
Chloe,
this game isn't fun.

11:27.898 --> 11:30.020
I'm having fun.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.612
I'm growing up

11:32.612 --> 11:34.985
and I won't always want
to play these games.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.868
We have to cherish
these moments.

11:37.868 --> 11:41.321
You're right.
My baby girl is growing up.

11:41.321 --> 11:43.373
Yeah, whatever.
Now go straight.

11:44.875 --> 11:46.086
Bend down.

11:47.377 --> 11:48.498
I got them!

11:48.498 --> 11:50.670
You sure did.
Game over.

11:50.670 --> 11:52.332
Now get out of here,
you crazy so-and-so.

11:52.332 --> 11:53.463
Go! Go! Go!

12:01.471 --> 12:04.554
STAN: The presents were hidden
somewhere in the ground.

12:04.554 --> 12:07.187
Before dinner started,
they had to be found.

12:07.187 --> 12:10.230
So we dug, and we dug,
and we dug dug dug dug.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.353
But all we could find
was a ten-legged bug.

12:13.353 --> 12:15.065
With a man's face!

12:15.065 --> 12:17.487
No, I'm kidding,
I'm kidding.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.821
Where are the presents?
I thought you said
they were near the reindeer.

12:20.821 --> 12:23.453
Maybe it was
near the gingerbread man,

12:23.453 --> 12:24.624
'cause I was thinking,

12:24.624 --> 12:26.456
"Oh, man,
I wish I was eating you."

12:26.456 --> 12:28.128
Then I thought,
"No, Stan, focus.

12:28.128 --> 12:29.870
You need to bury
the presents.

12:29.870 --> 12:31.792
Oh, but you'd be
so delicious.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.214
No, Stan, no!"
So that was my morning.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.178
There's a gingerbread decoration
over there.

12:38.178 --> 12:41.051
Oh, he does look delicious.
No, Tyler, no!

12:43.093 --> 12:45.765
Stan, you keep remembering
decorations near

12:45.765 --> 12:47.597
where you buried
the presents--

12:47.597 --> 12:49.649
snowman, ribbons, reindeer.

12:49.649 --> 12:51.271
We've dug holes
all over this park

12:51.271 --> 12:52.602
and we still
haven't found them.

12:52.602 --> 12:55.775
I have an idea.
But it might be too late.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.278
I shouldn't bury
the presents.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.112
I have to go back
and switch out with Chloe

13:02.112 --> 13:04.034
or Mom and Dad
will get suspicious.

13:04.034 --> 13:07.117
Hey, why are you guys digging
all these holes?

13:07.117 --> 13:09.209
It's a Christmas tradition
where we're from.

13:09.209 --> 13:10.250
In Nova Scotia.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.463
Yeah, that's actually
what Nova Scotia means.

13:13.463 --> 13:15.335
It means "dig holes."

13:15.335 --> 13:17.297
It means "New Scotland."

13:17.297 --> 13:18.548
So your need to correct me

13:18.548 --> 13:20.050
overtook your need
to explain this?

13:20.050 --> 13:22.262
Yes, it did.

13:23.423 --> 13:26.927
Digging holes?
That's a weird thing to do.

13:26.927 --> 13:29.769
Now it's time to pile
into a giant pair of pants.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.102
It is?

13:32.102 --> 13:33.143
Surely you remember

13:33.143 --> 13:35.735
the McCorkin Family
Christmas Pants Pile-In.

13:35.735 --> 13:37.898
I mean, every McCorkin
knows this.

13:37.898 --> 13:39.569
Uh...uh--

13:39.569 --> 13:42.242
Of course, it's where...

13:42.242 --> 13:45.825
We all climb into a giant
pair of pants to commemorate
( repeating )

13:45.825 --> 13:50.080
the Christmas blizzard of 1913
where the family survived

13:50.080 --> 13:52.162
by sewing
all their pants together

13:52.162 --> 13:54.955
and then climbing
in to share the warmth.

13:57.667 --> 13:58.919
Share the warmth.

14:00.050 --> 14:02.092
You do remember.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.344
Last one in the pants
is a rotten leg.

14:07.017 --> 14:09.769
Yes!
( forced laughter )

14:09.769 --> 14:11.431
Good luck
with the crazy pants.

14:11.431 --> 14:12.933
Yeah, you too.
You mean Mom?

14:12.933 --> 14:14.184
Yeah.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.149
Thanks, Joe.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.941
If you weren't charging me
three times

14:20.941 --> 14:23.153
what it would cost to have
had the store assemble it,

14:23.153 --> 14:26.116
I would say
you have the Christmas spirit.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.078
ELLEN: Bennett?
Shh!

14:28.078 --> 14:31.121
My wife cannot know
that anyone is helping me.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.953
Thanks, Joe.
You're the best.

14:32.953 --> 14:34.124
Who's Joe?

14:34.124 --> 14:35.295
Joe?

14:35.295 --> 14:38.838
Uh... is...
Joe the light?

14:38.838 --> 14:41.922
Joe the fox?
Joe the elf?

14:41.922 --> 14:43.003
Joe the elf!

14:45.055 --> 14:48.308
He's my little helper passing
along his workshop know-how

14:48.308 --> 14:51.011
and spreading
his elfin magic.

14:51.011 --> 14:53.013
I came out to see
how you're doing,

14:53.013 --> 14:55.015
and it's not well.

14:55.015 --> 14:58.228
But the trampoline's
coming along, so keep it up.

14:58.228 --> 15:00.190
Nice work, Joe.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.072
Oh, what's that, Joe?

15:02.072 --> 15:05.525
Oh. Ha ha ha!
You scoundrel. She's taken.

15:05.525 --> 15:07.077
Ha ha! Joe.

15:11.791 --> 15:13.243
Thanks, buddy.

15:13.243 --> 15:15.035
I bet this happens
all the time.

15:15.035 --> 15:18.208
You probably
have a lot of stories.

15:18.208 --> 15:21.251
It's okay.
We don't have to be friends.

15:21.251 --> 15:22.592
I was just hoping.

15:26.006 --> 15:27.217
Oh.
Have you seen Chloe?

15:27.217 --> 15:28.848
Oh, she finished
her potatoes,

15:28.848 --> 15:30.310
so it's my turn
to do the green beans.

15:30.310 --> 15:32.102
Okay, well, you get started
on those green beans.

15:32.102 --> 15:34.104
I'm going to get started
on my "mistle-tofu"

15:34.104 --> 15:36.856
and my "crispy duck the halls."

15:36.856 --> 15:38.818
Ha ha!
Good tidings one, Ellen.

15:42.272 --> 15:44.824
Why are you washing
the green beans one at a time?

15:46.196 --> 15:48.828
Certainly not to stall
for any reason,

15:48.828 --> 15:51.241
you crazy pants.

15:51.241 --> 15:54.574
Thank you. You know,
when you take a fashion risk,
you want it to be noticed.

15:54.574 --> 15:55.705
Thanks.

15:56.997 --> 15:59.419
So why are you washing them
one at a time?

15:59.419 --> 16:02.212
Oh, it's called micro-cooking.
It's much healthier.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.423
I've never heard of it.

16:03.423 --> 16:04.884
I'll send you
a web page about it.

16:06.256 --> 16:09.389
Note to self: make a web page
about micro-cooking.

16:09.389 --> 16:12.052
Other note to self:
get a voice recorder.

16:14.514 --> 16:17.057
Has anyone seen
a small bag of washers?

16:17.057 --> 16:19.769
What, Joe couldn't find them
for you?
Who's Joe?

16:19.769 --> 16:24.234
He's a friendly
Christmas elf on loan
from Santa's workshop.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.986
Just slid down a candy cane
from the clouds

16:26.986 --> 16:28.528
to help your dad
with a project.

16:28.528 --> 16:30.030
Oh, okay.

16:31.871 --> 16:33.663
I love you, son.

16:33.663 --> 16:35.075
I'm gonna go
check the family room.

16:35.075 --> 16:37.167
The family room?
Wait!

16:41.881 --> 16:43.333
Let's play a game.

16:43.333 --> 16:46.005
What is it with you
and your sister?!

16:46.005 --> 16:49.389
Shh.
Cherish these moments.

16:51.801 --> 16:53.093
STAN: With the presents
still missing,

16:53.093 --> 16:54.554
we shouldn't delay,

16:54.554 --> 16:57.057
but the Christmas Pants
Pile-in was well underway.

16:57.057 --> 17:01.101
♪ ...Ride in a one horse
open sleigh ♪

17:03.022 --> 17:04.814
Avery!

17:07.817 --> 17:10.990
We're cousin Ruth's grandkids,
we're from Nova Scotia

17:10.990 --> 17:12.652
and we dig holes
for Christmas.

17:12.652 --> 17:16.035
That all makes sense.
Where's Stan?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.328
♪ We wish you
a Merry Christmas ♪

17:18.328 --> 17:20.420
♪ We wish
you a Merry Christmas ♪

17:20.420 --> 17:22.462
♪ We wish you
a Merry Christmas ♪

17:22.462 --> 17:25.965
♪ And a happy new year ♪

17:27.046 --> 17:29.259
( cell phone buzzes )

17:29.259 --> 17:32.051
Tyler says he's almost done
with his green bean casserole

17:32.051 --> 17:33.633
and he's running
out of ways to stall.

17:33.633 --> 17:35.175
We need to find
those presents.

17:35.175 --> 17:38.017
Stan, we've dug
by the gingerbread man,

17:38.017 --> 17:41.141
the snowman, the reindeer,
the candy cane and nothing.

17:41.141 --> 17:42.602
I'm sorry, guys.

17:42.602 --> 17:44.144
I'm racking my brain here,

17:44.144 --> 17:47.066
but remember, my brain's
the size of a baby's fist.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.188
No, it's not.

17:48.188 --> 17:49.279
How am I supposed
to know that?

17:49.279 --> 17:51.901
My brain's
the size of a baby's fist.

17:51.901 --> 17:53.403
Guys, look at this.

17:53.403 --> 17:56.656
Snowman,
reindeer, candy cane--

17:56.656 --> 17:58.578
it's all on this
wrapping paper.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.250
Stan, could you have buried
our gifts

18:00.250 --> 18:01.581
in this pile of presents?

18:01.581 --> 18:04.294
Chloe, do you actually think
I'd be that--

18:04.294 --> 18:06.416
Yeah, that's exactly
what I did.

18:06.416 --> 18:08.258
This is great.

18:08.258 --> 18:10.089
We'll go grab our gifts
and sneak out of here

18:10.089 --> 18:12.051
before anyone even notices.

18:12.051 --> 18:15.054
Uh-uh-uh,
it's not time yet.

18:15.054 --> 18:16.886
But I do have
something for you.

18:16.886 --> 18:21.351
Cousin Ruth is here
and she's so excited to see you.

18:21.351 --> 18:22.482
What?

18:22.482 --> 18:27.147
Oh, wow,
our grandma is here.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.279
And she's coming over.

18:29.279 --> 18:31.571
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.

18:31.571 --> 18:33.533
Ivan stopped us
from going through the gifts

18:33.533 --> 18:35.825
and now we have
an old lady to dodge.

18:35.825 --> 18:37.157
We have to think fast.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.413
Okay, maybe not that fast.

18:49.919 --> 18:51.050
Ruth is almost here.

18:51.050 --> 18:52.512
Do you know
what you're going to say?

18:52.512 --> 18:54.254
I don't feel good about lying
to our grandmother.

18:54.254 --> 18:56.055
She's not really
our grandmother.

18:56.055 --> 18:58.558
Hey, if I'm going to lie,
it has to be real to me.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.892
Ruth, look. It's Ruth.

19:04.023 --> 19:05.855
You're not Ruth.
I'm Ruth.

19:05.855 --> 19:07.647
I'm Ruth, too.
Ask Ruth.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.529
That's the truth, Ruth.

19:09.529 --> 19:12.272
Now go get some eggnog,
you crazy so and so.

19:15.275 --> 19:17.036
Mom took Dad
to the chiropractor.

19:17.036 --> 19:18.908
His back went out
when someone jumped on him.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.241
I am getting big.

19:21.241 --> 19:23.283
The gifts are in here.

19:23.283 --> 19:25.285
Let's find them
and get out of here

19:25.285 --> 19:27.086
before Ruth realizes
what just happened.

19:27.086 --> 19:29.499
Oh, wow, Grandma made it.
Hi, Grandma.

19:32.792 --> 19:35.345
I found my tablet!
I found my cell phone!

19:35.345 --> 19:37.717
I found my game system.
They're all right here.

19:37.717 --> 19:40.800
All right, McCorkins,
they're here.

19:40.800 --> 19:44.564
Time to give all the gifts
to these deserving kids

19:44.564 --> 19:46.646
from the Toyless Tots
charity.

19:51.150 --> 19:52.191
I think we know
what we should do.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.777
Merry Christmas!

19:57.777 --> 20:00.079
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

20:00.079 --> 20:03.623
STAN: They gave out every toy,
every dingle zog-zogger.

20:03.623 --> 20:06.165
Dr. Seuss makes up words,
why not a dog blogger?

20:12.752 --> 20:13.793
( gasps )

20:13.793 --> 20:15.174
We've been robbed!

20:15.174 --> 20:16.215
The gifts are all gone!

20:16.215 --> 20:17.797
Well, it better
not have been Joe.

20:17.797 --> 20:19.339
The Christmas elf?

20:19.339 --> 20:21.301
I'm calling the police.

20:21.301 --> 20:23.843
On the Christmas elf?

20:23.843 --> 20:26.646
Don't call the police.
We took the gifts.

20:26.646 --> 20:28.398
We gave them away to kids

20:28.398 --> 20:29.979
who needed them
more than we did.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.231
We heard about a charity gift
drive in the park

20:32.231 --> 20:34.404
and we realized
we don't need presents

20:34.404 --> 20:36.195
to have a merry Christmas.

20:36.195 --> 20:37.407
We just need to be together.

20:37.407 --> 20:39.028
Oh.

20:39.028 --> 20:40.530
Thanks, Stan.

20:42.572 --> 20:45.285
You are the best,
most wonderful kids.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.367
You really understand
what Christmas is all about.

20:47.367 --> 20:49.248
It's 'cause
you're a great mom.
You're the parenting expert.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.171
Well, I do most of the work.
'Course, I'm the primary parent.

20:52.171 --> 20:54.173
( parents talking over
each other )

20:54.173 --> 20:57.216
Should we tell them that
we also gave away their gifts?

20:57.216 --> 21:00.009
Let's just ride this wave
as long as it lasts.

21:01.591 --> 21:03.142
STAN: Without presents
that night,

21:03.142 --> 21:05.224
there was
singin' and huggin'.

21:05.224 --> 21:08.017
It all worked out fine,
so why are ya buggin'?

21:10.730 --> 21:12.101
Well, why are ya?

21:12.101 --> 21:14.734
I'm not buggin'.
You buggin'.

21:14.734 --> 21:18.197
Now finish this up
so we can go to bed.

21:18.197 --> 21:21.240
Later that night,
Santa came on his sleigh

21:21.240 --> 21:24.073
and left the same gifts
the kids just gave away.

21:24.073 --> 21:26.866
He was no doubt impressed
by their holiday chutzpah.

21:26.866 --> 21:28.618
Plus he brought Dad
a multi-tool

21:28.618 --> 21:30.209
and Mom a foot spa.

21:34.253 --> 21:37.917
And I'm glad to report
Robert's family was stylin',

21:37.917 --> 21:40.420
'cause later they did their
own Christmas Pants Pile-in.

21:43.723 --> 21:46.225
Merry Christmas, everyone.
