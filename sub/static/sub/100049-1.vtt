00:01.120 --> 00:03.120
Previously on "How to Get Away
With Murder"...

00:03.120 --> 00:04.120
They know everything.

00:04.120 --> 00:05.960
We deserve to feel good
for once.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.290
Mrs. Maddox? I'd like to talk
to you about your son Gabriel.

00:08.290 --> 00:09.790
How do you not want to find
your birth parents?

00:09.790 --> 00:11.540
You looked for yours. You feel
good about what you found?

00:11.540 --> 00:12.750
Actually, yeah.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.620
Michaela might die
when she finds this out.

00:14.620 --> 00:15.580
What?

00:15.580 --> 00:17.120
I hacked
Louisiana Family Services

00:17.120 --> 00:18.040
and found
her birth father.

00:18.040 --> 00:19.170
His name's Dwight.

00:19.170 --> 00:20.250
Annalise knew him.

00:20.250 --> 00:21.540
She's drinking again.

00:21.540 --> 00:23.420
That's what your dad's case
did to her.

00:23.420 --> 00:26.210
Reporter:
Police have just confirmed
that Nathaniel Lahey Senior

00:26.210 --> 00:27.620
was fatally shot this evening.

00:27.620 --> 00:29.710
You paid those guards
to kill him!

00:29.710 --> 00:31.420
Annalise:
Did the Governor approach you
with this plan? Huh?

00:31.420 --> 00:32.750
She promise to get your father
out of jail?

00:32.750 --> 00:34.000
They know more.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.250
Plan B?

00:35.250 --> 00:36.880
She's given us
no other choice.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.750
The Governor just pointed
the finger at Emmett on live TV.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.290
Where's Christopher?

00:42.290 --> 00:43.620
They took 'em, Annalise.

00:43.620 --> 00:44.880
They took 'em.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.330
Annalise: Laurel!

00:51.380 --> 00:53.420
Minister: May God grant us
peace and comfort

00:53.420 --> 00:55.330
during this time of loss

00:55.330 --> 00:57.210
so that in our sorrow,

00:57.210 --> 00:59.920
we may find hope
and everlasting life.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.540
In the sure and certain hope

01:01.540 --> 01:04.170
of the resurrection
to eternal life,

01:04.170 --> 01:07.210
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

01:07.210 --> 01:09.210
we commit this body
to the ground.

01:09.210 --> 01:12.170
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,

01:12.170 --> 01:13.500
dust to dust.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.540
We're free now.

01:14.540 --> 01:17.000
To Him be glory forever.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.960
We ask that with this passing,

01:18.960 --> 01:21.500
we may find strength
in one another

01:21.500 --> 01:24.250
and solace in your words.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.960
Christopher!

01:27.960 --> 01:29.420
Christopher!
Christopher, no!

01:32.460 --> 01:33.830
Stay dead, bitch.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.500
Stop!

01:37.620 --> 01:38.620
Britt: Karen?

01:40.580 --> 01:42.080
Karen, you okay?

01:43.330 --> 01:45.380
Sorry.
It was, uh --

01:45.380 --> 01:47.250
No, no, there's no need
to explain.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.750
This visualization
was designed

01:49.750 --> 01:51.880
to stir up feelings
of discomfort.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.460
I'm just jealous.

01:53.460 --> 01:55.250
Your funeral
seems so interesting.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.290
Mine was a snooze.

01:56.290 --> 01:59.290
How about we don't compare,
Sally?

01:59.290 --> 02:02.000
But I do encourage you
to go dark here.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.750
Picture the worst consequences
of your addiction.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.330
What legacy have you left
your loved ones with?

02:08.330 --> 02:09.710
These are the questions

02:09.710 --> 02:11.920
you've come to Vista View
to answer --

02:11.920 --> 02:14.920
not how you want to live
the rest of your life,

02:14.920 --> 02:18.670
but really,
how do you want to die?

02:18.670 --> 02:21.040
So, everyone,
close your eyes again.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.500
Karen.

02:28.380 --> 02:31.460
Gently bring yourself
back to your funeral.

02:31.460 --> 02:33.380
See the people there.

02:33.380 --> 02:34.920
Are they angry?

02:34.920 --> 02:36.330
Maybe they're happy.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.620
Because that's how badly
you've hurt them.

02:47.290 --> 02:48.710
Sally: Hey, roomie.

02:50.290 --> 02:53.960
Stan and Heather
think you're a cop.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.170
I said principal --
high school.

02:56.170 --> 02:58.880
Or a boxer,
thus explaining the bandage.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.380
I'm a CEO.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.540
You're surprised,
I know,

03:01.540 --> 03:03.580
but I actually run
a Fortune 500 company.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.710
We make sex toys.

03:07.250 --> 03:09.880
JK. JK.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.750
I got a smile.
Go, me.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.420
Go, you.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.750
So...

03:15.750 --> 03:17.170
what'd you wanna stop?

03:17.170 --> 03:18.580
At your funeral.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.960
You scared the hell out of me
with that scream.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.330
It was nothing.

03:22.330 --> 03:24.580
Just give me
a little hint.
No!

03:24.580 --> 03:25.880
I'll tell you my secret
if you tell me yours.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.170
What is this?
What?

03:29.170 --> 03:31.170
Did Stan and Heather send you
over here to get some scoop,

03:31.170 --> 03:33.380
or are you just terrible
at reading people?

03:35.580 --> 03:38.540
I-It's rehab, Karen.

03:38.540 --> 03:40.540
We're all gonna know
each other's secrets eventually.

03:40.540 --> 03:42.290
Fine. Here's mine.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.580
I'm a gangster
who shoots people

03:43.580 --> 03:45.580
who don't know
when to shut up.

03:48.380 --> 03:49.620
Why would Annalise
go to rehab now?

03:49.620 --> 03:50.790
Yeah, won't she
lose her license

03:50.790 --> 03:52.040
if the bar finds out
she relapsed?

03:52.040 --> 03:53.500
They're not
going to find out.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.250
We just need to be happy
she's trying to get better.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.790
Are we sure
she's not with Laurel?

03:56.790 --> 03:59.080
Like, they took Christopher
to Argentina

03:59.080 --> 04:00.790
and are leaving us
to get burned by the FBI?

04:00.790 --> 04:01.830
We need to go
to the FBI.

04:01.830 --> 04:03.500
Absolutely not.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.790
A child is missing.

04:04.790 --> 04:06.790
He could be chained
in some basement with Laurel.

04:06.790 --> 04:08.710
Why don't we go to Xavier --
torture him till he
tells us where they are?

04:08.710 --> 04:10.040
Who are you?

04:10.040 --> 04:11.170
Frank would do the torture,
not me.

04:11.170 --> 04:12.540
Frank's not
gonna do that.

04:12.540 --> 04:14.250
Why? 'Cause you both know
that Laurel disappeared herself?

04:14.250 --> 04:16.080
She was stolen
off the street.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.460
And the only reason
they got Christopher

04:17.460 --> 04:18.620
is 'cause you two
took your eyes off him.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.920
That wasn't our fault.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.380
Who else's fault
would it be?
Get away from him.

04:21.380 --> 04:24.040
Fine. I prefer
kicking your ass anyway.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.330
Hey, hey! Hey!
Stop!

04:25.330 --> 04:27.210
This is hard enough.

04:27.210 --> 04:28.330
No!

04:28.330 --> 04:30.420
Hard is being trapped
in a basement somewhere

04:30.420 --> 04:32.420
and your friends
not doing anything about it!

04:32.420 --> 04:34.380
The FBI is still
investigating us, Michaela.

04:34.380 --> 04:36.540
Do you think going to them
and telling them

04:36.540 --> 04:38.830
that Laurel is now missing
is going to help any of that?

04:38.830 --> 04:40.290
Asher: Yeah,
it'll just make it worse.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.540
Emmett.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.250
Agent Lanford:
How did Mr. Crawford seem

04:45.250 --> 04:47.040
when you left him
in the office that night?

04:47.040 --> 04:48.580
Not like a man
about to kill himself,

04:48.580 --> 04:50.080
if that's
what you're thinking.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.380
He could have seen the Governor
accusing him on the news

04:51.380 --> 04:52.420
and panicked.

04:52.420 --> 04:54.880
And happened to have poison
lying around?

04:56.080 --> 04:57.000
You believe
he was poisoned?

04:57.960 --> 04:59.040
Wasn't he?

04:59.040 --> 05:01.120
He's dead, Annalise.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.540
Emmett.

05:02.540 --> 05:04.170
He's dead.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.830
I came back up right after
we got off the phone.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.830
We won't know the cause of death
until Mr. Crawford's autopsy.

05:11.830 --> 05:13.290
Then what about
the Governor?

05:13.290 --> 05:15.040
Please tell me
you're investigating her.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.380
You know that I can't comment
on an open investigation.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.750
Okay,
but it's obvious --

05:18.750 --> 05:19.880
Ms. Price...

05:22.000 --> 05:23.750
...call me if you remember
anything else.

05:25.420 --> 05:27.210
Oh.

05:27.210 --> 05:28.460
I heard you took
Crawford's place

05:28.460 --> 05:29.880
as the new
managing partner, right?

05:32.460 --> 05:33.500
Yes.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.710
Congrats.

05:41.330 --> 05:43.380
Annalise:
You've reached the voicemail
of Annalise Keating.

05:43.380 --> 05:44.880
Please leave a message.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.170
I was hoping you smuggled
your phone in your bra.

05:47.170 --> 05:50.580
Ish is crazy here,
as expected.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.380
Not your worry, though.

05:52.380 --> 05:55.040
I just wanted to hear
a friendly voice.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.500
Until then...
get your ass better.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.250
Britt: Okay, let's start
with our cleansing ritual.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.250
Turn to your partners.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.250
Together:
I see you, and I love you.
I see you, and I love you.

06:05.250 --> 06:06.580
I see you, and I love you.
I see you, and I love you.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.500
Britt: Okay.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.960
I'm curious to hear
about your reactions

06:10.960 --> 06:12.830
to your funeral visualization.

06:12.830 --> 06:13.960
Who wants to share?

06:13.960 --> 06:16.380
Personally,
I felt very uncomfortable

06:16.380 --> 06:17.420
picturing myself dead.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.880
I fe--
Okay, Sally,

06:18.880 --> 06:21.750
let's give somebody else
a chance to initiate, okay?

06:23.580 --> 06:24.580
Karen.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.380
Who did you see
at your funeral?

06:29.380 --> 06:31.290
If you'd prefer not to say,
just describe

06:31.290 --> 06:33.250
the general feelings
these people were having.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.620
They were...

06:36.620 --> 06:37.620
upset.

06:37.620 --> 06:40.040
Not that I was dead,

06:40.040 --> 06:42.250
but that
it took too long.

06:42.250 --> 06:45.080
Did anyone express
their feelings out loud?

06:46.670 --> 06:48.420
They were just grateful
that I was dead.

06:48.420 --> 06:49.330
Why?

06:51.080 --> 06:53.290
Because I chose drinking
over them.

06:53.290 --> 06:55.620
What do you all think
of Karen's response?

06:55.620 --> 06:57.170
Lame.
Heather:
Seriously, though,

06:57.170 --> 06:58.500
you're just gonna end up
back in here

06:58.500 --> 06:59.830
if you don't start
getting real.

06:59.830 --> 07:01.170
I've been saying that
for days now.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.500
I've been quiet,
listening to you

07:02.500 --> 07:04.120
complain about your mean boss
for days, Stan.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.830
There she blows!

07:05.830 --> 07:07.420
Okay, let's all
remain respectful.

07:07.420 --> 07:08.330
Him calling me a liar
is respectful?

07:08.330 --> 07:09.460
You know,
"liar's" pretty tame,

07:09.460 --> 07:10.750
considering
what we could say.

07:10.750 --> 07:11.960
Well, get ready for me
to call you some names.

07:11.960 --> 07:12.830
Go for it.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.210
Attention whore.

07:14.210 --> 07:15.080
Blowhard.

07:15.080 --> 07:15.920
Chauvinist.

07:15.920 --> 07:16.960
Boring.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.120
I never
called you anything!

07:18.120 --> 07:19.080
Quiet down.

07:22.290 --> 07:23.710
Clearly, you're good
with words, Karen,

07:23.710 --> 07:25.460
so let's turn that
inward.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.790
Tell us some of the names
you call yourself.

07:30.380 --> 07:31.500
Drunk. Selfish.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.210
Good.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.710
Mean. Narcissist. Freak.

07:36.710 --> 07:38.170
Keep going.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.580
Bitch. Bully.
Fat-ass. Slut.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.420
Trash. Homewrecker.

07:46.420 --> 07:47.580
Depressive.

07:47.580 --> 07:49.880
Ugly.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.120
Dirty.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.040
Taker. Cancer.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.290
Abuser.

07:56.540 --> 07:58.290
Monster.

07:58.290 --> 07:59.620
Mammy.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.040
Failure.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.250
Beautiful.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.460
All: We see you,
and we love you, Karen.

08:28.460 --> 08:30.290
Asher: Are we sure
we have the right Dwight?

08:30.290 --> 08:31.880
Yeah,
Michaela's birth certificate

08:31.880 --> 08:33.540
lists Dwight Halpern
as her father.

08:33.540 --> 08:35.120
He was born in 1964,

08:35.120 --> 08:36.880
just like
the guy in this article

08:36.880 --> 08:38.830
who Annalise
helped defend.

08:38.830 --> 08:40.290
We have to tell Michaela.

08:40.290 --> 08:42.000
We're not telling her anything
until Annalise gets back.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.710
If she comes back.

08:43.710 --> 08:45.750
Well, she better
so she can explain
why she picked me.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.080
Here we go.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.620
Look, she chose all of us
for a reason.

08:48.620 --> 08:50.000
Michaela now, too.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.790
Yeah, maybe she boned your dad
before he was gay.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.540
Or your mom.
No, that was me.

08:53.540 --> 08:55.540
Sweet-O,
time to get to work.

08:55.540 --> 08:56.790
Way to knock.

08:56.790 --> 08:58.790
Open your
computer hacking program.

08:58.790 --> 09:00.460
Try to ping
Laurel's location.

09:00.460 --> 09:02.420
Her family runs
a giant tech company.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.120
I don't think
they'd just let us "ping" her.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.250
Just do it.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.830
Michaela: Hey.

09:06.830 --> 09:08.830
Gabriel just texted me
that he's outside.

09:08.830 --> 09:10.750
You want me
to handle him?

09:10.750 --> 09:12.460
I just...want him
to go away.

09:12.460 --> 09:13.500
Gabriel: Michaela!

09:17.420 --> 09:18.420
What's wrong?

09:18.420 --> 09:19.880
Nothing.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.500
Then why are you
avoiding me?

09:21.500 --> 09:23.670
I'm not.

09:23.670 --> 09:24.710
You are.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.120
And I know why.

09:27.830 --> 09:29.620
Because I like you.

09:29.620 --> 09:31.670
I mean it.

09:31.670 --> 09:33.210
And I want you.

09:33.210 --> 09:34.790
Gabriel.

09:34.790 --> 09:36.460
Asher: Michaela?

09:37.460 --> 09:38.880
Laurel wants
to talk to you.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.580
In -- In the house.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.500
Where she is.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.000
I'll call you later.

09:50.670 --> 09:51.460
What are your intentions?

09:51.460 --> 09:52.620
What?

09:52.620 --> 09:54.790
"What?"
Your intentions.

09:54.790 --> 09:56.120
'Cause if you're trying
to get in her pants

09:56.120 --> 09:57.670
so you can betray us
to the FBI --

09:57.670 --> 09:59.460
I'm not talking
to the FBI anymore.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.420
How many times do I have to
tell you all that?

10:01.420 --> 10:02.830
Good.

10:02.830 --> 10:05.420
'Cause I'd rather have you
as my bro than my foe.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.790
Now, let's go home
so you can make me

10:08.790 --> 10:10.580
one of those famous
grilled cheese sandwiches.

10:15.460 --> 10:17.330
Britt:
So, research tells us

10:17.330 --> 10:19.830
that we can talk about
our feelings for years,

10:19.830 --> 10:21.330
but meanwhile,

10:21.330 --> 10:25.380
all those toxic thoughts
remain imbedded in our bodies.

10:25.380 --> 10:28.750
This exercise was designed
to release the bad thoughts

10:28.750 --> 10:31.710
so the good thoughts
can finally take hold.

10:31.710 --> 10:34.460
Alright?
So, pick up your bats.

10:34.460 --> 10:37.620
Three, two, one...

10:37.620 --> 10:39.620
go!

10:41.420 --> 10:44.580
I am not an idiot!
I am not a pushover!

10:44.580 --> 10:45.580
You tell 'em, Stan!

10:45.580 --> 10:47.170
Sally:
Die, bad thoughts!

10:47.170 --> 10:48.920
Die, wino!
Die, basic-bitch!

10:48.920 --> 10:50.880
Die, people-pleaser!

10:50.880 --> 10:53.290
You're more than an addict,
Heather. You are a goddess!

10:53.290 --> 10:55.040
I don't care
if you don't love me, Dad!

10:55.040 --> 10:56.250
I love me!

10:56.250 --> 10:57.670
Die, mean mommy!

10:57.670 --> 10:59.040
Die, prude!

10:59.040 --> 11:00.290
Intelligent and...
Gifted and outspoken!

11:00.290 --> 11:01.420
Kind!
Witty!

11:01.420 --> 11:02.960
You are good enough!

11:02.960 --> 11:04.120
Do you hear me, Sally?!

11:04.120 --> 11:06.250
You are good enough!

11:06.250 --> 11:08.330
You are good enough!

11:08.330 --> 11:10.880
You...are...good enough!

11:10.880 --> 11:13.420
Britt: The exercise
isn't for everyone.

11:13.420 --> 11:15.790
Somatic therapy isn't really
my thing, either.

11:15.790 --> 11:16.790
What is your thing?

11:16.790 --> 11:18.380
My vibrator.

11:18.380 --> 11:19.210
Mm.

11:21.250 --> 11:22.880
What about you
is selfish?

11:24.420 --> 11:26.330
I put myself first
always.

11:26.330 --> 11:28.710
Okay,
give me an example.

11:28.710 --> 11:32.080
Well, I'm here, and the people
who need my help are at home.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.290
Who needs you?

11:34.540 --> 11:35.580
Annalise:
Laurel, where are you?

11:35.580 --> 11:37.250
Laurel?!

11:38.710 --> 11:40.170
He's gone.
They're both gone.

11:40.170 --> 11:41.290
Your friends?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.580
What?
Tegan:
Emmett.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.750
He's dead.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.750
This is them, right?

11:48.750 --> 11:50.670
The Governor, Xavier?

11:52.250 --> 11:54.670
This was their plan --

11:54.670 --> 11:56.080
take out
another innocent man.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.330
Another.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.750
Annalise:
Doesn't matter who it is.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.790
All that matters is
that I let them down,

12:10.790 --> 12:11.920
and here I am.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.670
Trying to get better.

12:13.670 --> 12:15.290
Failing at it.

12:15.290 --> 12:17.210
Oh. Really?
How are you failing?

12:17.210 --> 12:20.250
I couldn't hit
the dumb pillow.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.540
Well, that doesn't
mean anything.

12:25.330 --> 12:27.920
You're paying a lot of money
to be here.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.960
It's really kind of a waste
if you don't let me know you.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.880
I know. I know.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.500
Then tell me --

12:33.500 --> 12:36.620
why do you think you deserve
to be this unhappy?

12:36.620 --> 12:39.040
I mean, unless you don't think
you're unhappy.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.210
I'm unhappy.

12:40.210 --> 12:41.380
Then let's hear it.

12:41.380 --> 12:43.960
Uh...

12:43.960 --> 12:47.620
There are people in my life
that got hurt.

12:47.620 --> 12:49.080
You hurt them?

12:50.210 --> 12:52.080
Mm-hmm.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.460
I thought
I was helping them.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.000
Oh.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.420
That just kind of sounds
the opposite of selfish to me.

12:58.420 --> 13:00.120
I want to leave them.

13:02.290 --> 13:04.000
You're thinking of
abandoning them?

13:05.210 --> 13:06.210
Mm-hmm.

13:06.210 --> 13:08.250
To protect myself.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.750
See? Selfish.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.000
Why shouldn't you
protect yourse--

13:11.000 --> 13:12.250
Because their pain
would be my fault.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.290
Not necessar--

13:13.290 --> 13:14.750
If I smacked you in the face
right now,

13:14.750 --> 13:16.500
your pain, my fault, no?

13:23.210 --> 13:26.000
I want to get better.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.380
I do.
I want to get better.

13:27.380 --> 13:28.790
Okay.

13:28.790 --> 13:31.330
I want that for you, too.

13:31.330 --> 13:33.040
But I'm worried
you won't.

13:34.710 --> 13:36.710
Not unless you learn
to forgive yourself.

13:36.710 --> 13:43.210
There's no moving forward
until you love yourself.

13:43.210 --> 13:45.460
And if I can't?

13:45.460 --> 13:47.750
Then you'll stay
where you are --

13:47.750 --> 13:51.000
angry, lonely, sad.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.380
All because
you put other people first.

13:53.380 --> 13:56.580
You put their feelings
before yours --

13:56.580 --> 13:58.670
what they need,
what they want.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.120
Until you wind up
in the hospital again,

14:02.120 --> 14:04.750
strung out,
left for dead.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.710
Or just...dead.

14:17.250 --> 14:18.960
What ME is doing
the Emmett autopsy?

14:18.960 --> 14:20.210
Stop.

14:20.210 --> 14:21.380
Somebody's got to
make sure

14:21.380 --> 14:22.750
Birkhead doesn't mess
with the results.

14:22.750 --> 14:23.830
And that's gonna be you?
Maybe.

14:23.830 --> 14:24.960
No.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.000
We have to move past this.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.250
Enough with the Governor
and Ron.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.750
And my pops?

14:28.750 --> 14:30.880
Am I supposed to just forget
what they did to him?

14:31.920 --> 14:33.830
Come on.

14:33.830 --> 14:35.580
I just want
the ME's name.

14:39.380 --> 14:40.710
Nate: Just tell me
to my face --

14:40.710 --> 14:42.290
no one's asking you to mess
with Crawford's results.

14:42.290 --> 14:43.670
I can't.

14:43.670 --> 14:44.750
You can't
or you won't?

14:44.750 --> 14:46.330
I can't because
the body's not here.

14:46.330 --> 14:48.120
Where is it?
London.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.170
Autopsy, funeral, burial --
It's all happening there.

14:50.170 --> 14:51.540
We transferred the body
this morning.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.250
On whose orders?

14:53.250 --> 14:54.420
A partner
at his law firm.

14:54.420 --> 14:55.710
Who?

14:57.120 --> 14:58.710
Tegan Price.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.620
Nate: Hey.

15:26.830 --> 15:28.420
How'd you get in here?

15:28.420 --> 15:29.580
I'm creative.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.960
Any news
on the autopsy results?

15:32.960 --> 15:35.620
No. And there won't be any
for a few days.

15:35.620 --> 15:37.830
The other partners wanted
his body transferred to London,

15:37.830 --> 15:39.170
made me sign off on it.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.000
That didn't seem sketchy
to you?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.710
They're my bosses.

15:42.710 --> 15:43.580
Convenient.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.540
Are you --

15:46.540 --> 15:48.330
You think I had
something to do with this?

15:48.330 --> 15:49.880
I didn't say that.

15:49.880 --> 15:53.500
Then be smart
and stop talking.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.330
Castillos probably have
this whole place bugged.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.420
Good. Then they should know
I'm coming for them.

15:57.420 --> 15:58.580
So you can end up
like Emmett?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.670
That a threat?

16:09.920 --> 16:11.750
He was lying right here
when I found him.

16:11.750 --> 16:14.500
Convulsing...

16:14.500 --> 16:16.380
foaming at the mouth.

16:16.380 --> 16:19.250
I gave him CPR,
begging him to breathe,

16:19.250 --> 16:21.040
watching his eyes
go blank.

16:22.620 --> 16:24.500
He was my friend.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.120
And you are not.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.210
So get the hell out.

16:42.790 --> 16:46.920
♪ Where in the world
is Laurel Castillo? ♪

16:46.920 --> 16:48.790
Don't make jokes.
This is a joke.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.540
Her phone is in a different city
every two seconds.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.380
Well, just try harder than
you did protecting Christopher.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.080
Are you gonna do this to us
for the rest of our lives?

16:55.080 --> 16:56.380
Probably.
Then can you
explain to us

16:56.380 --> 16:58.170
how we were supposed to know
that someone would

16:58.170 --> 16:59.750
break into our house
and kidnap him?

16:59.750 --> 17:01.540
He's a baby.
You're adults.

17:01.540 --> 17:03.080
That means it was your job
to protect him.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.960
Yeah, only 'cause she didn't
want you looking after him.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.080
Oliver.

17:07.790 --> 17:08.830
What does that mean?

17:10.580 --> 17:12.710
Laurel asked us to be
Christopher's guardian.

17:14.080 --> 17:15.120
You're lying.

17:16.710 --> 17:17.540
He's not.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.960
We can show you
the paperwork.

With each inhale, breathe in

17:35.750 --> 17:38.330
Picture yourself
as a small child...

17:38.330 --> 17:40.000
...in his or her place,

17:40.000 --> 17:41.750
a gentle sun --

17:41.750 --> 17:44.330
Sorry.
I-I'll just go to bed.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.170
Oh! Uh, you're supposed
to turn that in.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.750
Arrest me.

17:55.330 --> 17:56.790
Hey.

17:56.790 --> 17:59.710
Did you get
Emmett's autopsy results?

17:59.710 --> 18:01.830
The C&G partners
wanted it done in London.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.620
That's insane.

18:03.620 --> 18:05.830
I know. But there's nothing
we could have done to stop it.

18:05.830 --> 18:08.750
Or you, if you were here.

18:08.750 --> 18:09.670
Is the food
at least good?

18:09.670 --> 18:11.790
It's bland.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.580
I like my counselor.

18:14.580 --> 18:15.960
That's great.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.580
Yeah, she thinks
I need to be more selfish.

18:20.420 --> 18:22.000
Maybe she's right.

18:23.710 --> 18:25.750
You've beaten yourself up
enough.

18:28.460 --> 18:31.540
Tegan: Emmett.
He's dead.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.460
Do you know
what she took?

20:24.460 --> 20:26.960
Tox screen says cocaine,
MDMA, and fentanyl.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.170
Bonnie.

20:28.170 --> 20:30.540
Bonnie.

20:33.540 --> 20:35.000
It's all gonna be okay.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.620
No.

20:36.620 --> 20:38.920
I'm here.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.500
I need help, Bonnie.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.500
I need help.

20:58.420 --> 21:01.000
Oh, Britt's on her way
to confiscate your phone.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.170
JK!

21:04.170 --> 21:05.330

you dug into Michaela's parents.

21:44.620 --> 21:47.170
I found the security company

If we get the name

22:56.380 --> 22:58.380
with all the stress
going on around here.

22:58.380 --> 23:00.080
The opposite.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.210
If we can't find Laurel,
at least I can find them.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.120

Come on.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.210
I'm over you.

23:24.210 --> 23:25.960
We can talk
about this stuff.

We...

23:33.170 --> 23:34.500
haven't done it.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.170
What? Why?

23:36.170 --> 23:38.080
He's perf.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.460
It's just gonna end bad

23:39.460 --> 23:40.670
when he finds out
who we are.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.580
Meaning...?

23:42.580 --> 23:44.710
You know what I mean.

23:44.710 --> 23:47.710
I'm sick of every relationship
I've ever had ending in doom.

23:47.710 --> 23:49.580
Well, to be fair, the only
reason ours ended in doom

23:49.580 --> 23:51.000
was because you cheated.
I cheated.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.830
Oh, just listen
to those two lovebirds up there.

24:00.170 --> 24:01.460
You know,
Oli stayed with Connor

24:01.460 --> 24:04.000
even after he found out
about everything, so...

24:06.250 --> 24:08.540
There's still hope for us,
is all.

24:10.830 --> 24:12.540
It's Laurel.
Leave a message.

24:12.540 --> 24:14.790
But I'll probably
never listen.

I dare you.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.290
I've seen you
with a bat.

25:25.290 --> 25:28.080
It's not impressive,
Karen or...Beth

25:28.080 --> 25:30.120
or whatever
your real name is.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.920

I don't have to. I say "Karen,"
you don't turn around.

25:34.420 --> 25:36.170
That's because I'm trying
to avoid your ass.

25:36.170 --> 25:38.580
O-Oh. Like I've won
the roommate lottery?

25:38.580 --> 25:41.420
You never smile or -- or ask
anyone how they're doing.

25:41.420 --> 25:42.920
That's why people
don't want to eat with you

25:42.920 --> 25:44.960
or even be around you.

25:46.580 --> 25:48.620
You must be
a very hard woman to love.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.000
You want to know me,
Sally?

25:55.620 --> 25:58.420
I know that you're so nosy
about my life

25:58.420 --> 26:00.620
because yours is
so basic.

26:00.620 --> 26:03.210
That's why you checked in
here -- to be interesting.

26:03.210 --> 26:04.830
You're just
proving my point.
I mean, what's so hard
about your life?

26:04.830 --> 26:06.830
That giant rock on your finger
too heavy?

26:06.830 --> 26:09.080
Your husband stop screwing you
after popping out kids?

26:09.080 --> 26:10.290
Don't talk about my kids.
And now poor you

26:10.290 --> 26:12.500
is stuck driving carpool
in a fancy-ass SUV

26:12.500 --> 26:14.580
high on pills
and Chardonnay.

26:14.580 --> 26:16.880
Fine. You win.
Let's sleep.
But you're a mother,
so you're superior to me.

26:16.880 --> 26:18.210
I am more than a mother.
At least that's the lie
you tell yourself.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.420
So you obsess
over those kids.

26:20.420 --> 26:22.460
You beg them to need you
so your life has purpose.

26:22.460 --> 26:24.670
They are not my purpose.
They get a trophy,
you get a trophy.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.290
You are wrong!
But you know
deep down inside,

26:26.290 --> 26:28.620
you know how meaningless
your life is without them.

26:28.620 --> 26:29.960
I hate my kids!
I hate them!

26:29.960 --> 26:31.380
And I hate being a mother!

26:31.380 --> 26:33.080
I hate it!

26:33.080 --> 26:34.750
And I...

26:34.750 --> 26:36.710
hate myself...

26:36.710 --> 26:38.580
for hating them.

26:45.080 --> 26:47.750
I'm evil, right?

26:47.750 --> 26:50.170
I can't answer that one.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.040
Ohh.

26:55.790 --> 27:00.420
This is my fourth time
coming here.

27:00.420 --> 27:03.580
Every time,
I hope it'll work.

27:05.460 --> 27:08.080
But they're still there
when I get home.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.750
I just want
to run away forever.

27:20.170 --> 27:23.080
Me, too.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.830
And they're
not even my kids.

27:24.830 --> 27:27.120
They're just people
who need me.

27:27.120 --> 27:30.040
But they need me
so damn bad.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.790
I just...

27:44.580 --> 27:46.500
My name is
Annalise Keating.

27:54.330 --> 27:56.620

I murdered my husband,

27:56.620 --> 27:58.040
but I didn't.

28:01.750 --> 28:03.330
But I helped cover it up.

28:12.540 --> 28:14.920

10-18, what's your twenty?

28:14.920 --> 28:16.290

28:34.040 --> 28:36.120
Stan went aggro
at breakfast.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.620
He beat up a cook
'cause they ran out of bacon.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.580
I guess he was the one
that blew, not you.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.120
Hey.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.080
Morning.

28:59.540 --> 29:01.620

loved and touched and felt!

30:22.830 --> 30:25.460
You deserve to be free!

30:25.460 --> 30:28.920
I want out! I want out!

30:28.920 --> 30:31.920
Forgive yourself, Annalise!

30:31.920 --> 30:33.880
Forgive yourself, Annalise!

30:33.880 --> 30:35.380
'Cause I forgive you!

30:35.380 --> 30:38.250

31:16.710 --> 31:19.000

31:19.000 --> 31:20.210

31:20.210 --> 31:24.750
And...we have...
both now...

31:24.750 --> 31:27.170
said it.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.040
However...

31:31.040 --> 31:34.960

31:37.380 --> 31:38.750
What?

31:40.830 --> 31:42.920
She left.

31:42.920 --> 31:45.580
She took Christopher
and disappeared without a word.

31:45.580 --> 31:47.000
And...

31:47.000 --> 31:50.670
I don't know where they went
or if they're ever coming back,

31:50.670 --> 31:54.620
even though
she's my friend.

31:54.620 --> 31:56.000
My best friend.

31:58.540 --> 31:59.880
She's gone.

32:01.790 --> 32:03.170
And I'm tired
of being left.

32:05.830 --> 32:08.920
I need you to promise
that you'll never...ghost me

32:08.920 --> 32:11.380

or break up with me

32:11.380 --> 32:14.830

grown-up explanation.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.330
Because if you do...

32:23.380 --> 32:26.330
...I'll cut this off...

32:26.330 --> 32:29.380
and introduce it
to a garbage disposal.

I know I missed our call

34:54.710 --> 34:56.580
Vivian: So then you also know
you're gonna have to call me

34:56.580 --> 34:58.170
twice this week
to make up for it?

34:58.170 --> 34:59.620
'Course.
