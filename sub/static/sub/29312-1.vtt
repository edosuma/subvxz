00:01.135 --> 00:04.136
       (compelling music)

00:37.004 --> 00:39.271
      - [Tom] God, I hope
     we get there on time.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.773
         - [Luke] Yeah.

00:40.775 --> 00:41.707
     It's all right, I can
   always catch the next one

00:41.709 --> 00:43.208
         if I miss it.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.210
- [Tom] I guess you can, I know,
  but it's like Murphy's Law.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.745
 - [Luke] What's Murphy's Law?

00:46.747 --> 00:49.915
        - Murphy's Law,
      it's like Sod's Law.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.918
   - Like, anything bad that
    can happen will happen.

00:52.920 --> 00:53.786
     - [Tom] And, exactly.

00:53.788 --> 00:54.653
            - Right.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.789
   - I wonder who Murphy is?

00:57.691 --> 00:58.690
     - He's probably Irish.

00:58.692 --> 00:59.525
 - [Tom] Probably an Irishman.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.659
        - Yeah, he's...

01:00.661 --> 01:01.660
             Yeah.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.629
        - Or who Sod is,
        for that matter.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.931
       - I always thought
         it was 'cause,

01:05.933 --> 01:08.734
   if anything bad that could
    happen is gonna happen.

01:08.736 --> 01:09.601
    - [Tom] It will happen.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.036
    - Right, it will happen.

01:11.038 --> 01:14.673
     Then he's a poor sod,
  'cause he's really unlucky.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.908
            - I see.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.743
     Yeah, I know, but the
      name Sod has gotta,

01:17.745 --> 01:19.812
      I mean, the poor, I,
       it doesn't matter.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.315
   So, what's this girl like?

01:26.053 --> 01:27.986
     - I should have known
        this was coming.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.457
         I don't know.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.292
      - [Tom] Well, what's
     the color of her hair?

01:33.294 --> 01:34.493
            - Brown.
            - Brown.

01:35.863 --> 01:38.030
    And what does she study?

01:38.966 --> 01:40.799
     - She studies English.

01:40.801 --> 01:41.733
     - English literature?

01:41.735 --> 01:42.601
         - [Luke] Yeah.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.939
 - And what do you talk about?

01:46.941 --> 01:48.607
    - Dad, I don't wanna...
            (laughs)

01:48.609 --> 01:51.343
    I don't wanna talk about
   this with you, I'm sorry.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.381
       - Do you have long
 conversations into the night?

01:57.318 --> 01:58.584
             - No.
             - No?

01:58.586 --> 01:59.518
       - [Luke] Actually,
      yeah, we kind of do.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.919
           - You do?
            - Yeah.

02:00.921 --> 02:01.820
             Yeah.

02:04.658 --> 02:08.259
      (wrapper crackling)

02:08.262 --> 02:09.728
         You want one?

02:09.729 --> 02:10.795
   - [Tom] No, thanks, but do
 you realize how many wrappers

02:10.798 --> 02:12.231
       are on the floor?

02:12.233 --> 02:14.633
            - Sorry.
        (both laughing)

02:14.635 --> 02:16.235
Where else am I gonna put them?

02:16.237 --> 02:17.703
        - [Tom] I don't
       know, but, I mean,

02:17.705 --> 02:22.608
  there's basically an entire,
sort of, mound of mint wrapper.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.610
          - There's...

02:24.612 --> 02:25.811
    - [Tom] Or toffees, what
  are they, toffees or mints?

02:25.813 --> 02:27.045
      - No, they're mints
        and, okay, yeah,

02:27.047 --> 02:27.880
        there are quite
       a lot down there.

02:27.882 --> 02:29.314
        (both laughing)
             Sorry.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.116
  I don't know where else I...

02:31.118 --> 02:32.351
 - [Tom] Okay, it's all right.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.753
            - Sorry.
   - That's okay, it's fine.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.756
       (compelling music)

05:06.106 --> 05:09.007
       (leaves rustling)

05:25.793 --> 05:28.460
         (gentle music)

05:31.832 --> 05:34.833
       (birds fluttering)

05:37.037 --> 05:39.771
        (radio beeping)

05:43.110 --> 05:46.345
     (alarm clock beeping)

06:22.783 --> 06:26.017
     (toilet seat thudding)

06:26.019 --> 06:28.754
        (paper swiping)

06:32.626 --> 06:35.794
      (gentle piano music)

07:13.400 --> 07:15.300
   - [Beggar] Morning, love.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.468
     Got any change at all?

07:17.538 --> 07:18.570
       Any change, mate?

07:18.572 --> 07:20.005
Thank you, see you another day.

07:20.007 --> 07:20.839
          - Hey, Rich.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.574
     - [Tom] I'm not Rich.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.142
 - [Beggar] Same time tomorrow.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.112
 Are you a saver or a spender?

07:27.114 --> 07:29.080
    - [Beggar] I'm a saver.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.255
       (birds fluttering)

07:43.030 --> 07:45.931
       (thunder rumbles)

07:59.213 --> 08:02.948
       - I'm sorry, sir,
      you can't sit here.

08:02.950 --> 08:06.184
     (raindrops pattering)

08:12.359 --> 08:15.861
    (metal table clattering)

08:23.770 --> 08:26.505
        (keys jingling)

08:35.148 --> 08:38.015
       (thunder rumbles)

08:38.018 --> 08:40.684
         (door squeaks)

08:41.989 --> 08:45.223
         (upbeat music)

08:45.225 --> 08:46.157
      - Did you see that?

08:46.159 --> 08:47.726
       - He's an asshole.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.596
    - Yeah, he's an asshole.

08:53.634 --> 08:57.202
   (light switches clicking)

09:10.083 --> 09:12.250
    - [Radio Presenter] So,
   the big question today is,

09:12.252 --> 09:13.818
        is Plato right?

09:13.820 --> 09:17.289
   His quote, "Only the dead
   have seen the end of war."

09:17.291 --> 09:19.224
   Well, this quote appears--
      (footsteps clicking)

09:19.226 --> 09:20.458
           (banging)

09:20.460 --> 09:21.927
           - Christ.
  - Did I startle you, Tommy?

09:21.929 --> 09:22.928
             - Yes.
            - Good.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.596
      - Nobody ever calls
      me Tommy, all right?

09:24.598 --> 09:25.497
           - Really?

09:27.134 --> 09:28.833
       - Will you please
        keep that open?

09:29.636 --> 09:31.002
   - Can I ask you something?

09:32.105 --> 09:33.271
         - [Tom] What?

09:34.107 --> 09:35.373
    - What's wrong with you?

09:35.375 --> 09:36.908
    - What's wrong with me?
    - What's wrong with you?

09:36.910 --> 09:39.611
 Because every morning you move
 my table out of its position,

09:39.613 --> 09:42.113
   and it may seem important
       to you, but it's--

09:42.115 --> 09:43.582
            - It is.
         - Meaningless.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.817
And it makes you look crazy and
  it's beginning to wind me up

09:45.819 --> 09:48.019
       and, actually, no,
       fucking annoy me.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.255
        - But this is my
      side of the bookshop

09:50.257 --> 09:51.690
and the tables cannot be there,

09:51.692 --> 09:54.059
   and I don't want customers
      leaving their shit!

09:54.061 --> 09:56.227
     - Do you know what you
     look, you look crazy.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.362
      - Forgive me, okay?

09:58.532 --> 09:59.965
          - I'm sorry.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.299
     What did you just say?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.200
           - Nothing.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.836
         (man knocking)

10:07.240 --> 10:08.540
   - Just don't do it again.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.376
   And I'm serious, you know,

10:11.378 --> 10:12.944
       there is something
      very wrong with you.

10:14.548 --> 10:16.348
  And just get the door fixed!

10:22.823 --> 10:24.255
       - [Tom] So tell me
     more about this girl.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.724
     Come on, tell me, just
  give me a little something.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.859
         (Luke groans)
            - Okay.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.529
 I told you how we met, right?

10:31.531 --> 10:32.597
       - [Tom] Yeah, no.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.633
          - I didn't?
    - No, well, not really.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.403
 You told me she was American.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.871
            - Yeah.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.039
             So...

10:42.309 --> 10:44.009
        So you know that
        thing I went to?

10:45.412 --> 10:47.712
 It was like, you know, the art
  thing, the art installation.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.981
             - Yes.
   - Yeah, so, it was there.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.549
 Well, I think I told you that.

10:51.551 --> 10:55.487
 Anyway, I saw her there and I
 tried to go up to talk to her,

10:55.489 --> 10:58.590
    and then when I tried, I
 turned around and she'd gone.

10:58.592 --> 11:03.194
   So, I started looking for
  her, like a bit of a maniac.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.731
       And then just as I
     was about to give up,

11:06.733 --> 11:09.734
     I run out these doors
      and she's sat there,

11:09.736 --> 11:12.737
      outside on her own,
      and I had to pretend

11:14.107 --> 11:17.542
  like I didn't even know who
 she was or what she was doing,

11:17.544 --> 11:19.010
or that I wasn't looking for her

11:19.012 --> 11:20.879
   and I was just taking some
     fresh air or whatever.

11:20.881 --> 11:25.950
   And I kind of stood there
 for, like, a good minute or so

11:26.620 --> 11:28.153
      not saying anything.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.222
   And then she said, I think
   she said something like--

11:31.224 --> 11:32.724
   - What are you staring at?

11:32.726 --> 11:35.527
    - And I didn't know what
   to say, so I said, "You."

11:36.863 --> 11:38.163
        And she said...

11:39.299 --> 11:41.533
  God, I'm trying to remember.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.034
   - [Radio Presenter] It is
    one of Plato's dialogues

11:43.036 --> 11:44.669
     or actually find it in
   one of Plato's dialogues--

11:44.671 --> 11:46.037
         (door squeaks)

11:46.039 --> 11:48.573
    And we'll be very happy
     to add his or her name

11:49.710 --> 11:52.844
     to the credits at the
      end of the program.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.412
   - Please don't touch that.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.781
 - [Radio Presenter] 10:45 and
 so we continue our discussion

11:56.783 --> 11:58.249
        on the Crusades.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.752
     Here today to discuss
    what were the Crusades--

12:00.754 --> 12:04.723
    - [Tom] If you need any
    help, just let me know.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.730
         - What's this?

12:11.732 --> 12:12.964
           - A book.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.567
     - We can see that, but
    what sort of book is it?

12:15.569 --> 12:19.838
      - Le Carre, Smiley's
   People, Cold War thriller.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.905
          - So boring.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.007
      - Boring it is not.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.746
       (books clattering)
        (woman grunting)

12:27.748 --> 12:28.646
          That's okay.

12:30.684 --> 12:33.518
  Poor old drunk Dylan Thomas.
            - Sorry.

12:34.488 --> 12:35.887
             - Oh.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.555
 - Can I have some sweets, Mom?

12:37.557 --> 12:38.456
        - [Woman] Sure.

12:41.728 --> 12:44.796
        (woman sneezes)

12:44.798 --> 12:47.899
    - Please don't touch the
    sweets with your hands.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.234
     Here, there's scooper.

12:52.639 --> 12:53.505
          Here, hold--

12:53.507 --> 12:54.305
        (CDs clattering)
             - Oh!

12:54.307 --> 12:55.273
          - So sorry.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.442
             I'm...

13:02.115 --> 13:02.947
      (gentle piano music)

13:02.949 --> 13:04.149
     - Good Ol' Blue Eyes.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.988
    - Let's get out of here.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.556
              Oh!
         - Oh, careful.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.424
       We don't want any
       accidents, do we?

13:13.426 --> 13:14.325
        - No, we don't.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.429
     - [Radio Presenter] A
  total of 300,000 Christians

13:18.431 --> 13:20.932
     died during the march
    led by Peter the Hermit.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.901
       While the military
     campaign was a success

13:22.903 --> 13:24.169
        the behavior of
       the Christian army

13:24.171 --> 13:27.105
     certainly did not win
     them any new converts.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.873
         Crusaders were
       attacking Antioch.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.975
      They used the heads
         of slain Turks

13:30.977 --> 13:33.611
    as ammunition for their
       primitive cannons.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.413
      Apart from using the
      heads as ammunition,

13:35.415 --> 13:39.250
  about 300 heads were placed
 on stakes in front of the city

13:39.252 --> 13:41.953
       to demoralize the
     defenders of the city.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.789
  They were digging up corpses
  for their own consumption--

13:44.791 --> 13:45.690
            - Shit.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.159
             Shit!

13:48.161 --> 13:49.160
      - [Radio Presenter]
    Even those who had paid

13:49.162 --> 13:50.295
     the Christian leader--

13:50.297 --> 13:51.362
          - What's up?
      - They stole my bag.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.497
            - What?
      - I've been robbed!

13:52.499 --> 13:53.398
             - No.

13:57.671 --> 14:00.605
       (motor bike roars)

14:14.821 --> 14:17.755
       - [Bird] What are
        you staring at?

14:17.757 --> 14:18.656
             - You.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.625
         - [Bird] Why?

14:20.627 --> 14:21.926
      - You look so bored.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.996
      (inquisitive music)

14:28.802 --> 14:30.335
             Can I?

14:30.337 --> 14:32.904
         (Bird laughs)

14:41.314 --> 14:42.647
      - What's your name?

14:42.649 --> 14:44.115
         - [Luke] Luke.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.250
         - Hello, Luke.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.651
           I'm Kate.

14:46.653 --> 14:47.719
          Hello, Kate.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.924
        Can I kiss you?

14:52.926 --> 14:54.292
             - Wow.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.160
 You don't waste time, do you?

14:56.162 --> 14:57.729
 You're either gonna love this
   or you're gonna hate this,

14:57.731 --> 15:01.799
   I'm not sure, so she said,
 "Okay, yeah, my name's Kate."

15:01.801 --> 15:04.002
     I said, "Well, I'm not
     gonna call you Kate."

15:04.004 --> 15:07.071
I said, I'm gonna call you Bird.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.573
      And she said, "Why?"
             - Why?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.508
   - And I said, 'cause when
    you move your eyelashes,

15:10.510 --> 15:11.643
     they're like the wings
       of a hummingbird.

15:11.645 --> 15:12.911
    (Luke and Tom laughing)

15:12.913 --> 15:14.279
      - [Tom] Hey, that's
      a pretty good line.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.346
      - [Luke] It's pretty
        good, isn't it?

15:15.348 --> 15:17.949
- [Tom] It's a pretty good line.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.151
      It depends a little
     bit of you deliver it,

15:20.153 --> 15:21.386
    but that's a good line.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.254
      - Yeah, yeah, well,
     I think she liked it.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.991
       And then from then
        on it was Bird.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.960
             - Huh.
            - Yeah.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.010
    - Thanks for your help.

15:46.012 --> 15:47.645
  - [Colin] Ooh, shall I call
    the police or something?

15:47.647 --> 15:48.780
    - Yes, call the police.

15:48.782 --> 15:49.681
             Yeah.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.819
      - Yeah, I just wanna
       report a robbery.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.956
 Yeah, Chelsea Farmers Market.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.190
       The Book Pavilion.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.161
Yeah, it was a few minutes ago.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.095
             Hello?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.029
           - Coming?

16:05.031 --> 16:06.364
   - Yeah, yeah, I think so.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.633
    I didn't know you smoke.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.001
       - Well, I do now.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.469
   - So, Mr. Hammond, the...

16:12.405 --> 16:13.705
          Mr. Hammond.
             - Yes.

16:13.707 --> 16:14.839
        - Probably not a
        good time to ask

16:14.841 --> 16:16.874
  but was my money in the bag?

16:16.876 --> 16:18.576
       - Yes, all of it,
       every last penny.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.645
           - Oh, man.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.114
 Well, that's not good, is it?

16:25.852 --> 16:27.986
  - Just a few more questions.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.555
      Hope you don't mind.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.291
         - No, 'course.
     - No, no, not at all.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.727
  - [Policeman] I was actually
    talking to Mr. Hammond.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.195
             - Yes.
         - Yeah, right.

16:39.199 --> 16:39.948
        I'll come back.

16:39.949 --> 16:40.698
      I'll come back when
       things calm down.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.066
- [Tom] Yes, I'm sure you will.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.134
            - Okay.

16:43.136 --> 16:46.270
         (Tom exhales)

16:46.272 --> 16:48.306
       - [Policeman] What
      was in the bag, sir?

16:49.876 --> 16:50.775
            - Tommy?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.679
 Oh, sorry, am I interrupting?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.347
 - [Policeman] Sorry, you are?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.316
    - I own that restaurant,
         I'm a friend.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.618
  Rather, I know Mr. Hammond.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.187
- [Policeman] If I may continue.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.088
          - Certainly.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.156
        - The bag, sir.

17:06.593 --> 17:11.061
      - 500 pounds in cash
     for the damn plumber.

17:11.064 --> 17:11.963
             Book.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.065
       Yesterday's paper.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.968
            My keys.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.236
    But I have an extra set.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.138
             And...

17:26.378 --> 17:27.512
         A photograph.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.715
         (wind blowing)

17:34.254 --> 17:35.086
   - [Policeman] Photograph?

17:35.088 --> 17:36.287
    - [Tom] Yes, a Polaroid.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.128
      (gentle piano music)

17:52.605 --> 17:55.506
       (birds squawking)

17:58.645 --> 18:00.778
       (birds fluttering)

18:00.780 --> 18:03.581
        (birds chirping)

18:45.592 --> 18:49.660
(children playfully chattering)

18:59.873 --> 19:01.305
       - [Bird] You okay?

19:01.307 --> 19:02.206
            - Yeah.

19:05.879 --> 19:06.777
              No.

19:08.748 --> 19:09.780
      I'm gonna miss you.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.351
 - Why don't you just join me?

19:13.353 --> 19:14.585
    Come out for Christmas.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.655
         - To New York?
       - No, Madagascar.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.323
      Of course New York.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.591
         It's not far.

19:20.593 --> 19:21.993
      It's just across the
      Atlantic, you know?

19:21.995 --> 19:23.728
      - Yeah, it's just...

19:25.031 --> 19:28.733
      It's Christmas and I
   don't like leaving my dad.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.403
        (plane roaring)

20:05.538 --> 20:08.839
      But if I ask him, I
      know he'll say yes.

20:17.283 --> 20:19.884
     - What are the chances
    that you might find it?

20:19.886 --> 20:20.851
     - [Policeman] The bag?

20:20.853 --> 20:21.786
             - Yes.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.487
   Well, no, the photograph.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.855
     It will be difficult.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.825
        Thieves are only
    interested in the cash.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.161
       See, the rest the
     stuff they throw away.

20:30.163 --> 20:31.028
             - Yes.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.197
            - Okay.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.436
      - [Hannah] You okay?

20:39.539 --> 20:41.606
      - [Policeman] Sorry,
        one more thing.

20:41.608 --> 20:45.743
The photograph, what was it of?

20:45.745 --> 20:48.212
             - Of?
      - Yes, it may help.

20:51.517 --> 20:54.685
(people laughing and chattering)

20:54.687 --> 20:55.519
        (all exclaiming)

20:55.521 --> 20:57.388
     - Oh, that's not fair.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.856
  - It didn't make the sound.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.358
          - Sorry, I--
          - Oh, sorry.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.426
      - Hang on, hang on.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.494
    - I've got a good joke.
           (snapping)

21:03.496 --> 21:04.996
            - Uh-oh.
             - Oh!

21:04.998 --> 21:08.599
  - Okay, what does a frog do
   when his car breaks down?

21:10.837 --> 21:12.403
     He gets it toad away.

21:13.673 --> 21:14.605
             Sorry.
         (all laughing)

21:14.607 --> 21:16.007
   - [Davina] It's terrible.

21:16.009 --> 21:19.043
    - Somebody actually gets
      paid to write those.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.412
   Oh, gosh, my earring, ah.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.580
         - Here you go.
           - My hat.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.749
     - You have your mocks
        after Christmas?

21:24.751 --> 21:29.820
   - Yeah, I've got mocks in
    January, and then, yeah.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.858
     - I have to say, your
     son is very handsome.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.127
        - Yes, he takes
       after his mother.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.061
  - [Maryam] And where's she?

21:37.063 --> 21:38.429
   - She's no longer with us.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.333
 - I'm very sorry to hear that.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.237
     So, do you have plans
       for Christmas Day?

21:46.239 --> 21:47.805
     Sorry, it sounds like
     I'm interrogating you.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.273
             - No.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.275
  - [Maryam] I have the habit
     of being overfamiliar.

21:51.277 --> 21:53.878
  - Well, Luke is going to New
   York and I'm staying here.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.246
        - New York, why?

21:56.149 --> 21:57.982
     - He's fallen in love.

21:57.984 --> 21:58.949
          First love.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.151
  - [Maryam] Ah, how exciting.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.352
            - Yeah.

22:01.354 --> 22:02.586
       - [Davina] Do you
     have to do coursework?

22:02.588 --> 22:04.088
   - Yeah, for English, yeah.
            - Right.

22:04.090 --> 22:07.224
      - I think the key is
    to live in the present.

22:07.226 --> 22:08.626
    - [Tom] To the present.

22:08.628 --> 22:09.960
        (glasses clink)

22:09.962 --> 22:10.961
       - Well, yeah, and
      the half of it is--

22:10.963 --> 22:12.263
             - Tom.

22:12.265 --> 22:14.198
  Do you still have the balls?

22:14.200 --> 22:15.633
       (Maryam snickers)

22:15.635 --> 22:18.536
       - Girls, would you
        like to play...

22:19.339 --> 22:21.105
        - I'm intrigued.
            - Balls?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.373
    - [Davina] Can't say no.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.241
- Depends whose balls they are.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.178
- Then we shall go to the balls.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.313
   - [Tom] Let's play balls.

22:30.717 --> 22:31.615
        - Knock, knock.

22:33.753 --> 22:34.785
          Hello, Tom.

22:34.787 --> 22:35.753
       - [Tom] Hey, Mark.

22:37.156 --> 22:40.391
    Would you be kind as to
     take care of the shop

22:40.393 --> 22:41.625
       for a few minutes?

22:41.627 --> 22:44.261
      - I'm supposed to be
       picking up Maryam.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.530
       - Yeah, well, I'll
         be right back.

22:46.532 --> 22:47.765
         Be right back.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.468
             - Tom!

22:55.875 --> 22:56.841
            - Hello.
            - Hello.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.243
          - I'm Mark.
         - I'm Hannah.

23:00.313 --> 23:02.213
     - I'm his best friend,
       you'd never guess.

23:02.215 --> 23:03.814
    Haven't seen him in six
    months and off he goes,

23:03.816 --> 23:05.249
        cheeky bastard.
            - Yeah.

23:07.954 --> 23:11.088
      I'm sorry, I'm late
      to meet my brother.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.696
        (anxious music)

23:21.667 --> 23:22.800
        - He's a shaman.
         - Oh, come on.

23:22.802 --> 23:23.901
        - I can feel it.
    - He's about to explode.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.369
          - Oh, yeah.

23:25.371 --> 23:26.937
          Here we go.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.172
          Here we go!

23:28.174 --> 23:29.807
        - Bringing down
       the gods of bingo.

23:30.777 --> 23:31.976
   (Luke and Maryam laughing)

23:31.978 --> 23:33.978
    - [Davina] What on earth
      are you doing, Mark?

23:33.980 --> 23:36.313
      - [Tom] Is that what
       he's like in bed?

23:36.315 --> 23:38.182
      - Play up, play up,
       and play the game.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.250
         - We're ready.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.252
    - Two little ducks, 22.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.386
        - Quack, quack.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.288
     - That's my birthday,
         22nd of July.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.590
    - [Tom] Quackety-quack.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.560
       (paper crinkling)

23:49.562 --> 23:51.829
- Lucky for some, number seven.

23:51.831 --> 23:52.763
      - [Davina] Oh, yes.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.031
   - That's not on your card.

23:54.033 --> 23:54.999
        - [Davina] Mind
       your own business.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.001
   - [Tom] Are you cheating?

24:01.340 --> 24:03.474
 - [Davina] I am not cheating.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.276
           - She is.
 - Top of the Pops, number one.

24:05.278 --> 24:07.144
 - [Tom] Pops, number one, no.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.553
     - One moment, please.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.796
        (sirens wailing)

24:29.602 --> 24:33.070
        (sirens wailing)

24:33.072 --> 24:34.672
        (Mark laughing)

24:34.674 --> 24:37.975
         (all laughing)

24:37.977 --> 24:40.177
   - Me and you, number two.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.078
             - Ah.

24:43.449 --> 24:45.749
      - [Davina] Honestly.

24:45.751 --> 24:49.186
       (birds fluttering)

24:49.188 --> 24:51.856
        - All the sixes,
      clickety-click, 66.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.157
            - Bingo.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.592
            - What?
            - Bingo!

24:54.594 --> 24:56.560
      Bingo, bingo, bingo,
   bingo, bingo, bingo, yes!

24:56.562 --> 24:58.929
        (all exclaiming)

24:58.931 --> 25:00.698
       - [Mark] You have
       broken your duck.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.466
        - Yes, finally.

25:02.468 --> 25:03.801
     Told you it'd happen.

25:03.803 --> 25:07.872
(group chattering and laughing)

25:17.450 --> 25:18.682
        Finally, right.

25:18.684 --> 25:19.917
     Wait, wait, wait, no,
      Dad, come on, let's,

25:19.919 --> 25:20.885
     come stand next to me,
    let's get one together.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.086
            - Okay.
           - Come on.

25:22.088 --> 25:22.987
           You ready?

25:24.457 --> 25:26.190
     (Tom and Luke chuckle)

25:26.192 --> 25:27.191
        (camera clicks)

25:27.193 --> 25:29.159
        - There you go.
        (all exclaiming)

25:29.161 --> 25:30.327
       - [Maryam] Bravo.

25:30.329 --> 25:33.731
     (children chattering)

25:33.733 --> 25:36.467
        (anxious music)

25:38.871 --> 25:41.705
        (bird squawking)

25:42.775 --> 25:43.774
        (camera clicks)
          - Oh, yeah.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.776
    - Oh, naughty man, Mark.

25:45.778 --> 25:46.944
        (camera clicks)

25:46.946 --> 25:47.845
I've got to do better this time.

25:47.847 --> 25:48.679
         - More balls!

25:48.681 --> 25:50.981
      - [All] More balls!

25:50.983 --> 25:52.483
         - More balls!

25:52.485 --> 25:53.751
   - There were three fat men
    walking down the street

25:53.753 --> 25:55.419
       with one umbrella,
       how many got wet?

25:55.421 --> 25:56.954
         - Don't know.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.589
   - None, it wasn't raining.

25:58.591 --> 25:59.857
        (both laughing)

25:59.859 --> 26:01.025
          - Excuse me.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.560
        You haven't seen
     anybody in a red coat?

26:03.362 --> 26:04.261
        A red raincoat.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.497
          Blonde hair.

26:06.499 --> 26:07.398
            - Sorry.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.332
             - No.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.466
       Are you all right?

26:09.468 --> 26:10.668
   - [Tom] Yeah, yeah, fine.

26:14.006 --> 26:14.838
        (women laughing)

26:14.840 --> 26:15.873
    - [Maryam] Good evening.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.107
       - [Mark] Oh, dear.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.677
     - Thank you, ooh, for
      a wonderful dinner.

26:19.679 --> 26:20.945
          - And have a
      marvelous Christmas.

26:20.947 --> 26:21.912
    - [Luke] You're welcome.

26:21.914 --> 26:22.880
           Take care.

26:22.882 --> 26:23.981
         - Is he okay?

26:23.983 --> 26:25.816
       - No, I know him.

26:25.818 --> 26:26.750
         He got robbed.

26:28.621 --> 26:31.855
     (children chattering)

26:39.832 --> 26:40.965
    - Merry Christmas, Luke.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.666
    - Bye, Merry Christmas.
        - Bye, darling.

26:42.668 --> 26:44.368
         (Tom laughing)

26:44.370 --> 26:46.203
    - Have a wonderful time.
          - Thank you.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.404
        - [Davina] Bye!

26:47.406 --> 26:48.606
  - [Maryam] Merry Christmas.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.307
  - Merry Christmas, dear boy.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.576
       - Good to see you.
        - Great evening.

26:52.578 --> 26:53.510
       - Merry Christmas.
    - Thank you for coming.

26:53.512 --> 26:54.578
   - [Mark] Merry Christmas!

26:54.580 --> 26:55.312
       - Merry Christmas!
             - Bye.

26:55.314 --> 26:56.547
             - Bye.
             - Bye!

26:56.549 --> 26:59.183
         (Tom laughing)

27:00.119 --> 27:01.619
    - I'm very proud of you.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.320
        - What for, for
       winning the bingo?

27:03.322 --> 27:05.022
      - No, for being you.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.423
 - Don't forget you're driving
  me to the airport tomorrow.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.524
       - I won't forget.

27:07.526 --> 27:08.459
            - Okay.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.460
I'll get your Christmas present.

27:09.462 --> 27:10.394
      - [Luke] Thank you.

27:10.396 --> 27:13.230
        (sirens wailing)

27:17.803 --> 27:20.938
      (gentle piano music)

27:26.379 --> 27:27.811
          - Excuse me.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.046
         Give me that.

27:29.048 --> 27:29.980
            - What?
   - Give me that photograph.

27:29.982 --> 27:30.881
 - What the hell are you doing?

27:30.883 --> 27:32.416
        - Give it to me!
           - Get off!

27:32.418 --> 27:33.751
   - Man, what are you doing?
   - Give me that photograph.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.252
        - Let go of her!

27:35.254 --> 27:37.321
   - You were in my bookshop,
    you stole my photograph.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.589
        Now give it me!

27:38.591 --> 27:39.523
      - I have never seen
      you before in life.

27:39.525 --> 27:41.191
- Give it to me, give it to me!

27:41.193 --> 27:42.426
         Give it to me!

27:43.696 --> 27:46.196
        (women laughing)

27:46.198 --> 27:48.799
Come on, it's of me and my son.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.701
     Please, give it to me.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.374
- [Woman] What, do you want it?

27:57.376 --> 27:59.043
       Who is that, then?

27:59.045 --> 28:00.077
           Your son?

28:00.079 --> 28:02.846
        (women laughing)

28:03.816 --> 28:04.748
             - Tom.

28:04.750 --> 28:05.716
            - Don't!

28:05.718 --> 28:07.051
 - Yeah, go on, take him away.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.952
 - Yeah, don't come back, yeah?

28:08.954 --> 28:11.455
         (tense music)

28:11.457 --> 28:12.823
          - Fuck off!
             - Hey!

28:20.232 --> 28:22.366
        - [Tom] What are
      you all staring at?

28:22.368 --> 28:23.267
              Huh?

28:24.136 --> 28:26.970
        (menacing music)

28:40.853 --> 28:42.286
   - [Radio Presenter] There
    may have been Americans.

28:42.288 --> 28:44.288
        We're sending a
      number of inspectors

28:44.290 --> 28:47.758
  from our Pan Am certificate
   office, here in New York.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.460
         International
  transportation Safety Board

28:49.462 --> 28:51.729
  is putting together a team,
   as well, to go over there,

28:51.731 --> 28:53.263
        so that would be
   indication that Americans

28:53.265 --> 28:54.765
       would be on board.

28:54.767 --> 28:59.636
   We have no confirmation--
  (music overpowers speaking)

29:25.464 --> 29:28.198
        (organ blaring)

29:58.497 --> 30:00.831
    - Have you forsaken me?

30:00.833 --> 30:02.633
         I said, you've
      fucking forsaken me!

30:04.470 --> 30:05.536
      - Are you all right?

30:07.306 --> 30:08.372
      - I'm sorry, Father.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.810
    - If you need to talk...

30:12.812 --> 30:14.411
     - It was just a theft.

30:15.748 --> 30:16.980
         - What theft?

30:16.982 --> 30:20.684
    - A random act of theft
     sent me for tailspin.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.021
       I feel like I'm on
       the edge of the...

30:25.024 --> 30:27.090
            (sighs)

30:30.763 --> 30:32.129
        - I'm listening.

30:36.202 --> 30:37.067
         - [Luke] Dad.

30:37.069 --> 30:37.935
         - [Tom] Yeah.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.373
- Will you promise me something?

30:43.375 --> 30:44.575
            - Sure.

30:44.577 --> 30:46.076
             What?

30:46.078 --> 30:48.045
    - You know that bookshop
  you always said you'd open?

30:48.047 --> 30:48.912
         - [Tom] Yeah.

30:50.382 --> 30:51.481
  - Well, why don't you do it?

30:51.483 --> 30:52.983
           - Do what?

30:52.985 --> 30:54.017
- [Luke] Well, in the New Year,
  why don't you leave your job

30:54.019 --> 30:55.752
     in the city and do it?

30:55.754 --> 30:57.054
   - What's gotten into you?

30:57.056 --> 31:00.023
      - I don't know, but
      you seem so unhappy.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.391
   - [Tom] Well, everybody's
     unhappy in their jobs.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.994
           - Really?
        - Yeah, really.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.530
 And you'll learn that in time.

31:08.934 --> 31:11.501
 Okay, I'll promise, I promise
    that I'll look into it.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.737
          - You will?
      - I'll look into it.

31:13.739 --> 31:14.571
            - Yeah?
            - Yeah.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.874
            - Okay?
            - Okay.

31:16.876 --> 31:17.941
            - Happy?
             - Yes.

31:17.943 --> 31:21.044
            - Good.
        (both laughing)

31:21.046 --> 31:22.946
    All right, don't forget
     to call me, all right?

31:22.948 --> 31:25.649
  I know you're gonna be in a
whole lovey-dovey kind of mood,

31:25.651 --> 31:27.851
     but don't forget to--
           - Shut up.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.620
    - [Tom] Will you please
  call me when you get there?

31:29.622 --> 31:31.521
      - Yes, okay, I will.

31:31.523 --> 31:32.789
          - Have fun.
          - Thank you.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.024
            I will.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.360
 And if you open the bookshop--

31:36.362 --> 31:37.794
         - [Tom] Yeah?

31:37.796 --> 31:39.096
   - On the weekends I would
      work there for free.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.064
    Actually, no, I wouldn't
      work there for free.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.667
    I would want something,
     but I'd help you out.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.403
      So you wouldn't even
   have to get an assistant.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.571
     - [Tom] Oh, thank you.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.805
     Thank you for working
         for something.

31:48.807 --> 31:50.707
        (both laughing)

31:50.709 --> 31:53.143
     - Hey, it'd be cheaper
   than paying someone else.

31:56.382 --> 31:59.016
         (door creaks)

31:59.018 --> 32:00.284
          (door thuds)

32:00.286 --> 32:01.752
          - Oh, Mark.

32:01.754 --> 32:04.388
     I'm so sorry, it took
   longer than I anticipated.

32:05.858 --> 32:07.357
- Is everything all right, Tom?

32:07.359 --> 32:09.493
        - Oh, yes, yes,
    everything's fine, yeah.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.329
   I'll get you some cigars.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.431
- I don't want a fucking cigar.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.999
    I wanna see more of you.

32:17.336 --> 32:19.569
         Are you okay?
     - Yes, yes, I'm fine.

32:20.839 --> 32:21.738
          Here you go.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.308
   - Listen, Tom, I'm sorry.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.977
        It's just, I've
      left Maryam waiting

32:26.979 --> 32:28.178
 at the station for two hours.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.846
   - It's fine, I understand.

32:30.883 --> 32:33.951
       - Oh, you've some
    money, you made a sale.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.285

32:35.287 --> 32:37.521
      (register whirring)

32:37.523 --> 32:38.755
   - Oh, and one last thing.

32:38.757 --> 32:39.890
             - Yes.

32:39.892 --> 32:42.592
    - The nicely upholstered
        woman next door

32:42.594 --> 32:44.528
        that smells like
      the Garden of Eden,

32:44.530 --> 32:46.530
  she's left her home address.

32:46.532 --> 32:49.499
 She came back with her brother
    shortly after you left.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.568
 - Oh, well, that won't happen.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.504
  - I think you should go, it
 will do you the world of good.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.242
- Please send my love to Maryam.

33:00.713 --> 33:02.279
- [Mark] Yeah, of course I will.

33:02.281 --> 33:03.580
     Thanks for the cigars.

33:03.582 --> 33:04.481

    Mom used to talk about?

33:31.377 --> 33:32.876
   - We used to laugh a lot.

33:32.878 --> 33:34.111
          - Oh, yeah?
            - Yeah.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.545
       - [Luke] What did
        you laugh about?

33:35.547 --> 33:36.913
     - Well, we didn't talk
  about much is all I can say.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.115
       We used to laugh.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.016
       - It's kind of the
     same for us, actually.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.517
            - Is it?
            - Yeah.

33:40.519 --> 33:44.087
  - I used to laugh about how
   her toes used to twiddle.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.288
        - [Luke] Right.

33:45.290 --> 33:46.857
            - And--
            - Okay.

33:46.859 --> 33:50.127
   - I used to put the top of
 the laundry basket on my head

33:50.129 --> 33:51.995
  and pretend I was Japanese.

33:51.997 --> 33:54.631
        (both laughing)

33:54.633 --> 33:55.899
- [Luke] That's not even funny.

33:55.901 --> 33:57.934
     - Silly things, like,
      really silly things.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.205
    And sometimes we talked
 about more meaningful things.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.106
          - Like what?

34:04.910 --> 34:07.844
  - [Tom] About the universe.

34:07.846 --> 34:09.780
        We used to love
     looking at the stars.

34:15.020 --> 34:18.255
      About the immensity
       and insignificance

34:20.759 --> 34:23.793
 of us in the scale of things.

34:25.697 --> 34:26.830
      - [Luke] We kind of
       do that, as well.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.864
           - You do?
      - Yeah, I think so.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.436
  - [Bird] So, this is Buddha.

34:33.806 --> 34:37.940
  He is the chief of Buddhism.

34:37.943 --> 34:38.842
         - [Luke] Yeah.

34:40.646 --> 34:41.511
         - [Bird] And--

34:42.648 --> 34:43.580
 - You know so much about this.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.081
            - I do.
        - It's amazing.

34:45.083 --> 34:49.619
 - He has impressive powers for
  self-healing and meditation.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.353
    Have you ever meditated?

34:51.356 --> 34:53.290
             - Huh?
       - Okay, sit down.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.190
             Okay.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.429
          Fine, okay.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.764
     No, no, cross-legged.
            - Right.

35:00.766 --> 35:03.867
       - And you do this
        with both hands.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.135
            - Okay.
            - Yeah.

           One here.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.505
             Yeah.
     - I'm not very, okay.

        (both laughing)

35:14.046 --> 35:14.945
            - Okay.

35:16.014 --> 35:17.080
           Follow me.

35:17.082 --> 35:20.150
            - Okay.
      - And you go, (hums)

     - You can't park here.

35:51.116 --> 35:51.948
       - I'm not parking.

35:51.950 --> 35:52.949
       - Dad, my ticket.

35:52.951 --> 35:53.850
            - Yeah.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.853
           Oh, shit.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.121
        Oh, here it is.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.422

       checked the date.

        Oh, very funny.
           - Kidding.

36:05.597 --> 36:08.632

   - Oh, so who was it, then?

             - Yes.

44:39.644 --> 44:41.344
  I've come to collect my son.

44:41.346 --> 44:43.446
      He was on the Pan Am
      flight to New York.

44:44.683 --> 44:46.649
      - Where is it you've
    come from tonight, sir?

44:48.219 --> 44:50.186
        - I've come from
      London, from London.

44:52.123 --> 44:53.723
       - Would you follow
        me, please, sir?

44:57.462 --> 44:59.195
      I've had an inquiry.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.731
     This fella's turned up
      looking for his son.

45:01.733 --> 45:02.565
   Says he was on the plane.

45:02.567 --> 45:05.868
     (tense ambience music)

45:12.544 --> 45:15.378
        (spoon clinking)

45:34.399 --> 45:36.566
   - Would you please hurry?

45:40.238 --> 45:42.638
      Forgive me, I don't
    know if you understand,

45:42.640 --> 45:44.640
       but I need to get
        this to my son.

45:44.642 --> 45:46.209
   He's very, it's very cold.

45:46.211 --> 45:48.344
        - I understand,
       sir, take a seat.

45:48.346 --> 45:49.178
      Let's get something
        to warm you up.

45:49.180 --> 45:50.847
     Come on, have a seat.

45:50.849 --> 45:51.714
          Have a seat.

46:09.834 --> 46:11.067
              Sir.
             - Yes?

46:11.069 --> 46:13.636
   - I've got some biscuits.

46:13.638 --> 46:14.871
           You okay?

46:14.873 --> 46:16.072
             - Yes.
           - Come on.

46:17.408 --> 46:19.041
     - I've had enough tea.

46:19.043 --> 46:23.346
  (sirens wailing in distance)

46:23.348 --> 46:26.415
       You see, I've been
         here for hours

46:26.417 --> 46:29.218
      and all I want to do
    is give this to my son.

46:29.220 --> 46:30.153
       Do you understand?

46:30.155 --> 46:31.020
  - You need to listen to me.

46:31.022 --> 46:31.954
        - I'm listening.

46:31.956 --> 46:33.790
   - There are no survivors.

46:35.026 --> 46:35.925
     Do you understand me?

46:37.529 --> 46:38.427
         No survivors.

46:41.833 --> 46:44.000
   - No, I don't understand.

46:49.340 --> 46:50.773
             Luke?

46:50.775 --> 46:51.741
             Luke?
      (objects clattering)

46:51.743 --> 46:53.843
      - Help, I need help!

46:53.845 --> 46:55.211
           It's okay!
      - Sir, are you okay?

46:55.213 --> 46:56.479
       - It's okay, sir.
  - Come on, can you hear me?

46:56.481 --> 46:57.814
- [Mr. Carmichael] Just breathe.

46:57.816 --> 46:59.282
         Just breathe.
          - Yes, yes.

46:59.284 --> 47:01.417
- [Mr. Carmichael] Shh, breathe.

47:01.419 --> 47:02.318
          You're okay.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.586
             Okay.

47:03.588 --> 47:08.224
      (people chattering)
      (cameras shuttering)

47:30.682 --> 47:34.750
  - It is one of those nights
     one will never forget.

47:34.752 --> 47:39.822
 It's clearly been an appalling
  disaster and all our hearts

47:41.226 --> 47:43.826
   and our thoughts go out to
   the large number of people

47:43.828 --> 47:48.397
 who will undoubtedly have died
 as a result of this accident.

47:49.801 --> 47:52.401
   - Tragedies of this nature
   are impossible to predict.

47:53.771 --> 47:57.773
  It's just a most unfortunate
   and incredible situation.

48:00.144 --> 48:01.744
  And we're very, very sorry.

48:04.582 --> 48:07.049
       - [Journalist] How
      many Americans were
       on the plane, sir?

48:08.419 --> 48:11.187
    - [American Official] I
   can't tell you precisely.

48:11.189 --> 48:13.990
   I would assume that there
  were a great many Americans

48:13.992 --> 48:15.291
 percentage-wise on the plane.

48:15.293 --> 48:17.593
      (cameras shuttering)

48:17.595 --> 48:20.263
         (car whirring)

48:28.673 --> 48:30.673
 - [Man On Radio] Eye witnesses
   said the shattering force

48:30.675 --> 48:32.708
     of the collision made
      it almost impossible

48:32.710 --> 48:34.477
  anyone could have survived.

48:34.479 --> 48:37.280
  Searchers found the corpses
  had been horribly mutilated

48:37.282 --> 48:38.514
       by the explosion.

48:38.516 --> 48:41.083
         (eerie music)

49:48.886 --> 49:51.620
        (heart beating)

50:06.571 --> 50:08.270
- [Mark] Broken your duck, Luke.

50:08.272 --> 50:09.505
       - [Luke] Finally.

50:09.507 --> 50:11.007
     Wait, wait, wait, no,
      Dad, come on, let's,

50:11.009 --> 50:13.042
   come and stand next to me,
    let's get one together.

50:13.044 --> 50:13.943
             Ready?

50:24.255 --> 50:27.256
       (metal clattering)

50:35.433 --> 50:38.934
    (cabinet doors thudding)

52:27.812 --> 52:28.978
         - White Fang.

52:50.868 --> 52:52.968
            (laughs)

53:29.607 --> 53:30.940
     - Shall we get drunk?

53:30.942 --> 53:32.841
     - Oh, yes, yes, very.

53:34.312 --> 53:35.411
          I'll get it.
  - No, you sit down, I'll go.

53:35.413 --> 53:36.412
      - [Tom] Oh, please.

53:37.682 --> 53:39.882
     - There's a bottle of
      white in the fridge.

53:39.884 --> 53:40.816
        - [Tom] Uh-huh.

53:40.818 --> 53:41.784
       And the corkscrew?

53:42.887 --> 53:45.754
    - It's in a basket when
     you go in on the left.

53:45.756 --> 53:46.655
         - [Tom] Okay.

54:00.238 --> 54:02.838
         (match swipes)

54:16.454 --> 54:17.353
             - Hm.

54:18.322 --> 54:20.522
     Corkscrew, corkscrew?

54:21.325 --> 54:26.395
     Where's the corkscrew?

54:30.668 --> 54:32.501
         Was that your
      brother at the park?

54:33.671 --> 54:35.070
        - [Hannah] What?

54:35.072 --> 54:37.673
     - [Tom] The man whose
 shoulder you were leaning on.

54:37.675 --> 54:39.074
     Was that your brother?

54:39.076 --> 54:40.776
        - [Hannah] Yeah,
       that's my brother.

54:40.778 --> 54:41.677
          - [Tom] Huh.

54:47.018 --> 54:49.184
      (objects clattering)
              Oh.

54:49.186 --> 54:50.819
             - Tom?

54:50.821 --> 54:51.720
            - Yeah.

54:56.894 --> 54:57.793
             Sorry.

54:57.795 --> 54:59.028
       - [Hannah] Oh, no.

54:59.030 --> 55:00.596
        - They all fell.
       - It's all right.

55:02.967 --> 55:04.933
  He's the most understanding
    person I've ever known.

55:04.935 --> 55:06.435
        - [Tom] Oh yeah?

55:06.437 --> 55:07.936
    - [Hannah] And tells the
   worst jokes in the world.

55:07.938 --> 55:09.271
 - [Tom] Oh, really, like what?

55:09.273 --> 55:11.106
      - [Hannah] Like, you
     remind me of the sea.

55:11.108 --> 55:12.341
     - [Tom] The sea, why?

55:12.343 --> 55:13.609
  - Because you make me sick.

55:13.611 --> 55:15.678
        (both laughing)

55:15.680 --> 55:18.580
    - Oh, Luke used to tell
     silly jokes like that.

55:18.582 --> 55:19.648
          Here you go.

55:46.310 --> 55:47.576
    I bought him the ticket.

55:49.814 --> 55:51.213
       - He wanted to go.

55:52.583 --> 55:54.283
        He was in love.

55:54.285 --> 55:56.118
          He wanted to
     experience more of it.

55:57.421 --> 55:59.488
      How were you to know
   that was going to happen?

56:01.792 --> 56:05.427
      (somber piano music)

56:05.429 --> 56:06.895
       - I have been such
         a shit to you.

56:06.897 --> 56:08.263
   Why are you being so kind?

56:11.702 --> 56:13.235
 - Because we share something.

56:14.205 --> 56:16.271
    - [Tom] And what's that?

56:20.010 --> 56:20.909
            - Pain.

56:27.418 --> 56:30.319
       (birds squawking)

56:35.192 --> 56:37.493
       - [Bird Voiceover]
       Dear Mr. Hammond.

56:37.495 --> 56:39.361
  I am Kate Louise Pemberton.

56:40.731 --> 56:44.266
       Or Bird, the name
       your son gave me.

56:45.736 --> 56:48.504
  Before you throw this letter
   away, please read it all.

56:49.807 --> 56:52.875
     It's taken me several
  months to put pen to paper,

56:52.877 --> 56:56.044
       trying to find the
      right things to say,

56:56.046 --> 57:00.115
     but the truth is, I'm
  still not sure what to say.

57:00.117 --> 57:03.218
     Yes, I am the one who
 invited your son to New York,

57:04.522 --> 57:07.256
    and I am the one who was
waiting for him at the airport.

57:07.258 --> 57:09.358
            - Bang.
           (laughing)

57:11.295 --> 57:12.127
           I'm sorry.

57:12.129 --> 57:12.961
        No, you hate me?

57:12.963 --> 57:14.163
     Okay, fine, that's it.

57:15.699 --> 57:16.865
      - [Bird Voiceover] I
  thought we were gonna spend

57:16.867 --> 57:18.534
the rest of our lives together,

57:19.437 --> 57:21.737
not just those few short weeks.

57:23.441 --> 57:26.842
      Love at first sight,
      as the cliche goes.

57:26.844 --> 57:30.946
      Luke and I met at a
     party, and after that,

57:30.948 --> 57:34.983
 he was the only person I ever
 wanted to spend my time with.

57:37.021 --> 57:38.821
But I am now left with nothing.

57:40.424 --> 57:43.892
     I have nothing to hold
   onto but memories of him.

57:43.894 --> 57:44.793
         - I love you.

57:45.896 --> 57:47.596
       - [Bird Voiceover]
         Just like you,

57:47.598 --> 57:50.732
  I am now confronted with the
   pain of trying to move on.

57:53.437 --> 57:54.903
       - I love you, too.

57:54.905 --> 57:56.972
  - [Bird Voiceover] The truth
    is, if he hadn't met me,

57:56.974 --> 57:58.507
      he'd be alive today.

57:59.543 --> 58:00.409
          I know that.

58:01.812 --> 58:04.780
   And that is something that
   I will have to suffer with

58:04.782 --> 58:06.782
       every day for the
        rest of my life.

58:08.486 --> 58:13.555
      For now, and I hope
       you understand, I
      wish to mourn alone.

58:16.994 --> 58:19.394
     Maybe a time will come
     when I can think back

58:19.396 --> 58:21.663
       on those precious
     memories without pain

58:21.665 --> 58:23.365
   and life can start again.

58:48.092 --> 58:51.660
       - [Tom Voiceover]
    Dearest Bird, if I may,

58:51.662 --> 58:55.063
      I'm so happy and so
     sad to hear from you.

58:55.065 --> 58:57.266
  You say that you don't have
    the strength to face me.

58:57.268 --> 58:59.468
   Well, let me tell you that
   I don't have the strength

58:59.470 --> 59:01.904
   to face anything anymore.

59:04.375 --> 59:09.444
      (controls clicking)
      (gas flame whizzing)

59:17.354 --> 59:21.557
  But I've noticed in my grief
 that what I believe in today,

59:21.559 --> 59:23.125
 I may not believe in tomorrow.

59:25.863 --> 59:27.262
  I wanna tell you everything,

59:27.264 --> 59:29.565
        so please excuse
      me if I go too far.

59:37.141 --> 59:42.210
  Luke's funeral was attended
 only by me and my best friend.

59:43.480 --> 59:46.448
    I knew that I could not
    bear to see the anguish

59:46.450 --> 59:50.152
  on so many young faces, the
    curling of parents' arms

59:50.154 --> 59:51.920
      around the shoulders
         of the young.

59:53.724 --> 59:55.757
  Perhaps I was being selfish.

59:56.961 --> 59:57.859
         I'm not sure.

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:03.498
   I wanted to say to my best
    friend that perhaps Luke

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:05.968
       was too beautiful
        for this world,

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:09.404
      but instead my head
      was full of noises,

01:00:09.406 --> 01:00:11.139
 noises that I could not hear.

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:13.609
         (somber music)

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:16.845
    I wanted to put my hands
    over my ears and scream,

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:18.847
        but I couldn't.

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:33.195
 I'm happy that you enjoyed my
 son for those few short weeks.

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:35.731
       I watched him grow
       into a young man.

01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:41.903
        You say that you
      have nothing of his.

01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:44.406
    Well, the day that Luke
     was coming to see you,

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:46.942
  I bought him a blue sweater,

01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:50.045
   something to keep him warm
  during his trip to New York.

01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:54.249
    But somehow I was never
    able to give it to him,

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:57.853
    so I thought that maybe
      you should have it.

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:03.525
 If it becomes a burden, throw
    it away, but it's yours.

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:09.231
  I understand you well, Bird,

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:11.600
       and I will let you
        mourn in peace.

01:01:14.238 --> 01:01:15.904
 I wish I could mourn in peace.

01:01:17.574 --> 01:01:21.610
     And maybe one day, one
      day, we shall meet.

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:33.889
      - Did you ever meet?

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.695
  - I did think of contacting
       her after 9/11 but

01:01:42.066 --> 01:01:43.532
       she was so young.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:44.399
        - [Hannah] Hmm.

01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:49.705
      - I better be going.

01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:55.544
 Ooh, sorry, I drank your wine.

01:01:56.747 --> 01:01:57.746
        (clears throat)

01:01:57.748 --> 01:02:00.682
       (Hannah laughing)

01:02:00.684 --> 01:02:01.550
             What?

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:06.888
  - Do you know, it's not even
  that funny, it's just that.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.458
         It's a little
    ridiculous, your collar.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.460
             - Oh.
 - Look at that, there you go.

01:02:11.462 --> 01:02:12.861
 You need someone in your life.

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:15.564
    - It's too complicated.

01:02:15.566 --> 01:02:16.631
          - Oh, is it?

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:26.675
           Thank you.

01:02:28.512 --> 01:02:29.978
         - Good night.
         - Good night.

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:36.118
       I'll see you out.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.018
        - [Tom] Thanks.

01:02:41.658 --> 01:02:42.891
   - [Radio Presenter] We're
     getting reports today

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:44.693
      that Dick Cheney is
       close to achieving

01:02:44.695 --> 01:02:47.763
   from the Libyan government
    $1 million for families

01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:50.365
   related to the victims of
    the Lockerbie disaster.

01:02:50.367 --> 01:02:51.867
    The latest in the report
    is Abdelbaset al-Megrahi

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:55.971
       has been sentenced
      to life for his role

01:02:55.973 --> 01:02:57.873
   in the Lockerbie bombings.

01:02:57.875 --> 01:03:01.076
      Compensation for the
 families of the PA103 victims

01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:02.811
         were among the
      steps set by the UN

01:03:02.813 --> 01:03:04.880
        for lifting its
    sanctions against Libya.

01:03:04.882 --> 01:03:07.783
  Other requirements included
     a formal denunciation

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:10.752
   of terrorism, which Libya
   said it had already made.

01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:13.455
  In accepting responsibility
        for the actions

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:16.424
    of its officials on the
     15th of August, 2003,

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:19.294
           Libya's UN
     ambassador, Ahmed Own,

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.663
     submitted a letter to
    the UN Security Council

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:24.232
       formally accepting
 responsibility for the actions

01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:26.401
       in relation to the
       Lockerbie bombing.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:29.404
         (wind blowing)
       (leaves rustling)

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:30.572
 The UN canceled the sanctions

01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:32.207
    that have been suspended
        for four years.

01:03:32.209 --> 01:03:35.110
          The US trade
     sanctions were lifted.

01:03:35.112 --> 01:03:38.580
    Then Libya offered up to
   US dollars of 2.7 billion

01:03:38.582 --> 01:03:41.850
      to settle claims by
   families of the 270 killed

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:42.918
   in the Lockerbie bombing.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.587
         (somber music)

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:55.030
       - [Tom] What's the
       color of her hair?

01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:56.531
            - Brown.
            - Brown.

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:03.305
    Here, it's your sweater.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:04.940
      - [Luke] I'll get it
     when I get back, okay?

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:05.941
      Promise, thank you.

01:04:05.943 --> 01:04:06.908
          I love you.

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:12.747
         (Bird panting)

01:05:05.936 --> 01:05:08.670
        (plane roaring)

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:19.915
      - [Father] Beautiful
         day, isn't it?

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:21.383
     - Yeah, it is lovely.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.486
 - [Father] I love those boats.

01:05:24.488 --> 01:05:25.854
      - Mm, they are nice.

01:05:25.856 --> 01:05:28.056
       - [Father] Wish we
       could live in one.

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:28.990
       - [Son] I do, too.

01:05:28.992 --> 01:05:30.859
- [Father] Which one do we want?

01:05:30.861 --> 01:05:32.060
      - [Son] I like that
      red one over there.

01:05:32.062 --> 01:05:33.862
    - [Father] Do you, that
      used to be a ferry.

01:05:33.864 --> 01:05:35.163
      That would have gone
     up and down the river.

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:37.332
       (birds squawking)

01:05:37.334 --> 01:05:39.701
     - [Son] What are those
    people over there doing?

01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:41.369
- [Father] Looking for treasure.

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:43.972
       - [Son] Treasure?

01:05:43.974 --> 01:05:45.507
         - [Father] Mm.

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:46.975
   A long time ago, a Spanish
   galleon sank in the river

01:05:46.977 --> 01:05:48.710
 and it was full of gold coins.

01:05:50.514 --> 01:05:52.180
     - [Son] In the water?

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:53.815
       - [Father] In the
       water, in the mud,

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:55.283
       but the mud's too
      deep for the divers,

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:58.320
   so they send in these big
 machines to help them search.

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:03.325
      - [Son] Wow, can we
      go and have a look?

01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:04.859
   - [Father] I think it's a
   bit dangerous, don't you?

01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:06.294
   I mean, I think we should
   leave it to the machines.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:09.030
   They've got these special
tools to help them find things.

01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:12.834
         - I'm hungry.

01:06:14.204 --> 01:06:16.204
   - Well, let's go somewhere
    and have our sandwiches.

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:18.073
 - Why can't we have them here?

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:21.076
     - [Father] No, it's, I
     don't want to be late.

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:22.711
     - [Son] But they might
    have found the treasure.

01:06:22.713 --> 01:06:24.379
       - They won't, it's
       a big, big river,

01:06:24.381 --> 01:06:25.981
one of the biggest in the world.

01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:27.849
  They'll be looking for days.

01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:29.184
    - How big is the river?

01:06:29.186 --> 01:06:30.051
          - Enormous.

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:31.052
           - How big?

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:33.421
      - At least this big.

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:35.223
      - Is it bigger than
        the River Nile?

01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:39.127
   - No, no, it's not bigger
      than the River Nile,

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:40.996
    but it's very, very big.

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:44.532
        - Do you promise
        we'll come back?

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:45.800
       - Cross my heart.

01:06:45.802 --> 01:06:48.336
        - Pinky promise?

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.738
        - Pinky promise.

01:06:50.941 --> 01:06:51.806
           - Come on.

01:06:59.783 --> 01:07:01.750
          Wonder what
     sandwiches we've got?

01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:05.153
     - [Son] Ooh, yeah, I'm
    looking forward to that.

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:06.855
   - [Father] The planes have
 changed their flight path now.

01:07:06.857 --> 01:07:08.156
       They're coming all
      the way over there.

01:07:08.158 --> 01:07:11.459
     (hopeful piano music)

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:24.873
     I wonder what sort of
     sandwiches we've got.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:29.944
        - I hope it's--
  (music overpowers speaking)

01:10:18.949 --> 01:10:19.847
           - Hannah.

01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:24.886
            Hannah.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:26.754
          I found it.

01:10:29.426 --> 01:10:31.092
  - You found the photograph?

01:10:31.094 --> 01:10:32.026
             - Yes.

01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:34.629
It's all faded, but I found it.

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:37.832
            - Where?

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:38.933
      - At the riverbank.

01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:40.201
         - [Hannah] Oh.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:46.140
  - I was looking at a father
    and son, and they were,

01:10:46.142 --> 01:10:48.343
  they were talking, and they
   reminded me of Luke and I,

01:10:48.345 --> 01:10:51.579
     and the boy looked at
    me straight in the eyes.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:54.949
       It was as if I was
    being looked at by Luke.

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.720
      And then I found it.

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:06.761
            My boy.

01:11:09.132 --> 01:11:10.031
            My boy.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:22.143
        Yeah, you can't
      really see anything.

01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:23.077
       - It's beautiful.

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:24.812
- You can't really see anything.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:26.914
        But I found it.

01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:31.653
         In a way I...

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:34.422
        In a way I don't
       need it any more.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:38.559
  Now that I've found it, in a
 way I don't need it any more.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.700
      I found it, Hannah.

01:11:45.702 --> 01:11:46.768
      - I'm happy for you.

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:47.869
         - I found it.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.984
        (birds chirping)

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:05.620
         (somber music)

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:09.824
  - [Tom Voiceover] Dear Bird,

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:13.261
   it has been so long since
    our last correspondence

01:12:13.263 --> 01:12:15.229
        and I hope this
     letter finds you well.

01:12:16.633 --> 01:12:19.901
        There have been
       so many unresolved
    questions, who to blame.

01:12:21.137 --> 01:12:23.171
      I feel that we will
      probably never know

01:12:23.173 --> 01:12:25.306
          who the true
      culprits really are.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.714
    There's been talk about
     the Libyan government

01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:36.784
  giving a large compensation,
 but I see that as blood money.

01:12:38.254 --> 01:12:41.489
    I don't believe anything
       that anyone says,

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:44.025
   especially the people that
 have the power to investigate

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:46.094
      this heinous crime.

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:49.864
     As a way to celebrate
       Luke's brief life,

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:53.067
  I've decided to return back
 to Lockerbie for his birthday.

01:12:55.205 --> 01:12:56.971
    It'll be the first time
      that I've been back

01:12:56.973 --> 01:12:59.107
       since the tragedy.

01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:05.012
    There is a small church
     that I'm told is close

01:13:05.014 --> 01:13:08.116
  to the approximate location
  where Luke's body was found,

01:13:09.285 --> 01:13:10.685
     close to a beech tree.

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:16.257
  I wanna visit this place and
 somehow I wanted you to know.

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:18.393
        Sincerely, Tom.

01:14:38.308 --> 01:14:41.108
        (crow squawking)

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:07.969
         - Mr. Hammond?

01:15:12.242 --> 01:15:13.140
             - Yes.

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:19.347
            - I'm--

01:15:19.349 --> 01:15:20.248
             - Oh.

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:29.924
          You're Bird.

01:15:29.926 --> 01:15:30.825
           You came.

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.628
      - [Bird] Of course.

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:38.399
        - And you're...

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:47.275
 You're wearing Luke's sweater.

01:15:47.277 --> 01:15:48.409
     - I hope that's okay.

01:15:53.182 --> 01:15:54.715
   I wear it when I miss him.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:03.524
       You look like him.

01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:08.362
          - Oh, Bird.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.333
      I miss him so much.

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:18.172
 - Mr. Hammond, I am so sorry.

01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:19.473
      - [Tom] Oh, no, no.

01:16:19.475 --> 01:16:20.374
             - I...

01:16:21.344 --> 01:16:22.243
             - No.

01:16:24.414 --> 01:16:25.313
            Oh, no.

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:37.625
      Let's go for a walk.

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:29.076
        (graceful music)

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:23.898
         (Bird panting)

01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:50.157
         (Bird laughs)

01:19:00.303 --> 01:19:02.002
          - Hey, hey.

01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:02.937
         You all right?

01:19:02.939 --> 01:19:04.772
            - Yeah.
          - You okay?

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:06.340
            Come on.

01:19:06.342 --> 01:19:08.476
     You've hurt your knee.

01:19:08.478 --> 01:19:09.710
          - Oh, yeah.

01:19:09.712 --> 01:19:11.912
             Shit.
       - Is it all right?

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:13.247
   - [Bird] Yeah, it's fine.

01:19:16.552 --> 01:19:18.519
          - All right?
             - Hey.

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:21.255
        (both laughing)

01:20:41.304 --> 01:20:44.438
      (somber piano music)
