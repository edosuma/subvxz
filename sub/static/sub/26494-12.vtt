WEBVTT

00:03.432 --> 00:04.698
Who are you?

00:04.700 --> 00:06.400
We're the guys that
save that world.

00:06.402 --> 00:08.602
- What are you doing?
- What I have to.

00:10.372 --> 00:11.571
He's brain dead.

00:11.573 --> 00:13.407
Machines keeping him
breathing.

00:13.409 --> 00:14.441
It's like you said, Dean.

00:14.443 --> 00:16.076
Whatever it takes.

00:17.112 --> 00:19.212
Huh?

00:19.214 --> 00:21.581
Nick said when he left
he was just gonna go home.

00:21.583 --> 00:22.916
I-I didn't know
he was...

00:22.918 --> 00:24.184
Killing people?

00:24.186 --> 00:25.619
My whole family
was slaughtered.

00:26.789 --> 00:28.088
The best thing
I could hope for

00:28.090 --> 00:29.423
is that I catch the monster
who did it.

00:29.425 --> 00:30.590
There's this guy.

00:30.592 --> 00:32.259
He said his name
was "Abraxas."

00:32.261 --> 00:34.161
No way.

00:34.163 --> 00:35.362
Nick?

00:35.364 --> 00:36.897
Aah!

00:40.369 --> 00:43.136
You couldn't fix me 'cause
I don't want to be fixed.

00:45.107 --> 00:46.740
I can feel him
in my head.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.842
Michael gets out,
that's it for this world.

00:48.844 --> 00:51.812
Billie said that there's only
one way that this ends right.

00:51.814 --> 00:54.414
A Ma'lak box.
Secured and warded.

00:54.416 --> 00:57.551
Once inside...nothing gets out,
not even an archangel.

00:57.553 --> 00:59.653
Plan is to charter a boat
to take me out to the Pacific.

00:59.655 --> 01:00.654
Splash.

01:00.656 --> 01:01.788
You and Michael,

01:01.790 --> 01:03.957
trapped together --
for eternity?

01:06.328 --> 01:08.929
It's the only sane play
I've got.

Didn't mean to wake you.
Sorry.

02:36.985 --> 02:39.719
No, it's just a...
bad dream.

02:39.721 --> 02:41.621
<i> Sammy?</i>

02:41.623 --> 02:43.189
It's fine.

02:43.191 --> 02:44.457
You want
to talk about it?

02:44.459 --> 02:47.394
No, I'm --
No, I'm okay.

02:48.764 --> 02:51.231
What are you doing?
Why don't you get some sleep?

02:51.233 --> 02:52.999
You know, Dean,

02:53.001 --> 02:54.734
you don't
have to act like

02:54.736 --> 02:57.404
what you're planning to do
is just business as usual.

02:57.406 --> 03:00.640
I-I know you're scared.

03:00.642 --> 03:03.109
Never said
I wasn't scared.

03:03.111 --> 03:05.545
- But it doesn't matter.
-Doesn't matter?

03:06.915 --> 03:10.350
Dean, we know we could die,
uh, doing what we do.

03:10.352 --> 03:12.419
It's always a possibility.
But what you're talking about

03:12.421 --> 03:13.987
is far worse
than death.

03:13.989 --> 03:16.022
Michael's an archangel.

03:16.024 --> 03:18.024
He could
literally keep you

03:18.026 --> 03:21.695
buried in a coffin,
alive, forever.

03:21.697 --> 03:23.163
Okay.

03:23.165 --> 03:24.230
I get it.

03:24.232 --> 03:25.665
But what's
the other option, huh?

03:25.667 --> 03:28.501
Michael gets outta my head
and ends the world?

03:28.503 --> 03:30.136
'Cause it's all right there
in Billie's book.

03:30.138 --> 03:31.871
Yeah, but that's only
if don't find another way

03:31.873 --> 03:34.107
to take Michael off the board,
and there has to be another way.

03:34.109 --> 03:35.675
And what
is that other way?

03:39.781 --> 03:40.947
Exactly.

04:47.115 --> 04:49.215
Aah!

04:49.217 --> 04:51.918
Help, please! Please!

04:51.920 --> 04:53.720
No!

04:58.427 --> 05:01.227
Please! No!

05:41.870 --> 05:44.304
Okay, sunshine.

05:44.306 --> 05:45.572
Soup's on.

05:46.174 --> 05:48.575
And bad
as the food is here?

05:48.577 --> 05:51.377
Gourmet compared to what
you'll be gettin' in jail,

05:51.379 --> 05:53.346
so...enjoy.

05:54.916 --> 05:57.550
When am I
getting out of here?

05:59.154 --> 06:01.254
I'm not sure.

06:01.256 --> 06:04.324
At least four jurisdictions
want to prosecute.

06:05.193 --> 06:07.427
You were a busy bee.

06:07.429 --> 06:10.063
Yeah, what went down...

06:10.065 --> 06:11.698
none of that
was my fault.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.233
Right.

06:13.235 --> 06:15.101
'Cause you were "possessed."
By "Satan."

06:15.103 --> 06:17.103
And that's real.

06:17.105 --> 06:19.405
That's a real thing,
okay?

06:19.407 --> 06:21.074
And he left me, but...

06:22.511 --> 06:24.177
...it changed me.

06:26.047 --> 06:27.981
Listen,
you piece of crap.

06:29.017 --> 06:30.950
You want to say the Devil
made you do it,

06:30.952 --> 06:33.586
well,
you stick with that.

06:33.588 --> 06:36.122
'Cause either way,
you're gonna be locked up

06:36.124 --> 06:38.358
for the rest
of your life.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.759
You're done.

06:39.761 --> 06:41.461
You're buried.

07:02.484 --> 07:04.651
Hey.

07:04.653 --> 07:06.486
Man, I-I just want
to make sure that

07:06.488 --> 07:08.655
you're still with me
on this thing.

07:08.657 --> 07:10.690
You're gonna see it
through to the end.

07:10.692 --> 07:12.158
Well, I gave you my word,
didn't I?

07:12.160 --> 07:13.793
Okay, all right.
Just, you know,

07:13.795 --> 07:15.862
after what you said last night,
I-I-I don't need you and Mom

07:15.864 --> 07:17.130
coming up with
some way to stop me.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.498
You know,
Mom hates this.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.866
I hate this.
I know.

07:19.868 --> 07:22.168
And Cass and Jack,
you haven't even told them.

07:22.170 --> 07:23.603
Okay, well, yeah,
that's because I'm not good

07:23.605 --> 07:25.305
with the whole big goodbyes,
all right?

07:25.307 --> 07:27.373
I-I-I don't need
to get shaky on this thing.

07:27.375 --> 07:29.142
Wouldn't be
the worst thing.

07:33.014 --> 07:34.714
You know what
Michael wants to do,

07:34.716 --> 07:36.149
you know that
this will stop it,

07:36.151 --> 07:37.750
and you know that
there's no other way.

07:37.752 --> 07:39.853
So just put the end of this trip
out of your head, okay?

07:57.372 --> 07:59.606
Sam.
<i>Cass.</i>

07:59.608 --> 08:01.741
Were you able
to talk him out of it?

08:01.743 --> 08:03.643
No. So I'm counting
on you.

08:03.645 --> 08:06.079
Um, any luck?
I-I did as you asked.

08:06.081 --> 08:08.014
I've -- I've looked for
any possible way

08:08.016 --> 08:10.416
to forcibly extract Michael
and destroy him.

08:10.418 --> 08:12.785
- But so far, nothing.
- And what about Rowena?

08:12.787 --> 08:15.355
<i>She went through the entire</i>
<i>Book of the Damned</i>

08:15.357 --> 08:17.690
<i>and found nothing.</i>
<i>And I told her to do it again,</i>

08:17.692 --> 08:20.860
see if she missed
something, and, uh...

08:20.862 --> 08:24.664
well, the woman has a remarkable
command of profanity.

08:24.666 --> 08:26.799
All right, thanks.
Uh, keep going.

08:26.801 --> 08:30.303
Sam. Maybe if
I spoke with Dean...

08:30.305 --> 08:31.704
It wouldn't matter.
Believe me,

08:31.706 --> 08:33.740
I-I've never seen him
like this.

08:33.741 --> 08:35.475
He won't listen to me.
H-He just --

08:35.477 --> 08:37.243
No.

08:37.245 --> 08:38.711
If we don't
find some way...

08:40.081 --> 08:41.447
...Dean's gone.

09:34.202 --> 09:37.704
"For I will
strike down the firstborn

09:37.706 --> 09:40.707
in the land of Egypt..."

09:40.709 --> 09:43.943
What are you doing?

09:46.214 --> 09:49.248
"And against
all the gods of Egypt

09:49.250 --> 09:50.450
I will execute judgment."

09:50.452 --> 09:52.018
You don't have to do this.

09:52.020 --> 09:54.988
No. Please, no!

10:33.561 --> 10:35.795
"I am the Lord."

11:00.342 --> 11:03.176
You ever think about
when we were kids?

11:03.178 --> 11:05.979
Maybe. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes. W-Why?

11:09.685 --> 11:12.152
I know I wasn't always
the greatest brother to you.

11:17.026 --> 11:19.292
Dean,
you were the one

11:19.294 --> 11:24.097
who was always
there for me.

11:24.099 --> 11:25.599
The only one.

11:25.601 --> 11:28.235
I mean, you practically
raised me.

11:32.107 --> 11:34.908
I know things
got dicey...

11:34.910 --> 11:37.377
you know, with Dad...

11:37.379 --> 11:38.979
the way he was.

11:38.981 --> 11:40.714
And I just...

11:40.716 --> 11:43.650
I didn't always look out for you
the way that I should've.

11:43.652 --> 11:46.353
I mean, I had
my own stuff, you know.

11:46.355 --> 11:47.788
In order
to keep the peace,

11:47.790 --> 11:49.990
probably looked like
I took his side quite a bit.

11:54.530 --> 11:57.297
Sometimes, when I was...

11:57.299 --> 11:59.666
when I was away,

11:59.668 --> 12:02.002
you know it wasn't
'cause I just ran out, right?

12:05.441 --> 12:07.541
Dad would...

12:07.543 --> 12:10.510
He would send me away
when I really pissed him off.

12:12.915 --> 12:14.648
I think
you knew that.

12:16.118 --> 12:18.118
Man, I left that behind
a long time ago.

12:20.389 --> 12:21.655
I had to.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.658
And if we're gonna
get through this,

12:24.660 --> 12:27.160
I-I have to do
like you said and...

12:27.162 --> 12:29.629
try and keep my mind off
of where we're going.

12:29.631 --> 12:32.566
So if we could not

12:32.568 --> 12:35.869
have conversations
that sound like...

12:35.871 --> 12:38.171
deathbed apologies,

12:38.173 --> 12:41.074
I would
really appreciate it.

12:42.478 --> 12:43.677
Right, yeah.

12:53.055 --> 12:55.689
Answer me.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.791
Answer me.
You owe me that.

12:57.793 --> 13:00.026
I think God's
pretty done with you.

13:00.028 --> 13:02.562
Why would you even
bother praying to him?

13:02.564 --> 13:03.930
I wouldn't.

13:06.535 --> 13:09.202
Could you do me a solid?
I have to use the can.

13:12.741 --> 13:14.708
Oh, come on.

13:16.712 --> 13:17.978
Seriously?

13:17.980 --> 13:19.913
Come on, man,
give me a little bit of --

13:19.915 --> 13:22.282
a little dignity.
I got, uh -- I got, uh, cuffs.

13:22.284 --> 13:24.718
I got a bum leg.
What the heck am I gonna do?

13:26.155 --> 13:28.088
Thank you.

13:28.090 --> 13:29.289
You know the drill.

13:29.291 --> 13:31.124
Hands behind your back.

13:31.126 --> 13:32.325
Yeah.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.934
Listen, I, uh -- I'm pretty sure
I found us a case.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.902
A case?
Yeah.

14:17.139 --> 14:19.339
You know this trip
isn't about finding a case.

14:19.341 --> 14:21.808
I know, I know,
but -- but it's on the way --

14:21.810 --> 14:23.376
uh, Fort Dodge, Iowa.

14:23.378 --> 14:25.178
And if we can help,

14:25.180 --> 14:27.981
then shouldn't we?

14:27.983 --> 14:30.150
It's on the way.
Maybe.

14:30.152 --> 14:33.086
Yeah. "One last case
for the Winchester boys."

14:33.088 --> 14:34.788
Don't --

14:34.790 --> 14:36.456
You had to go there.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.024
Okay, j-just...

14:38.026 --> 14:40.427
There have been
at least two murders.

14:40.429 --> 14:43.597
Uh, one was just tonight,
and the police reports say,

14:43.599 --> 14:47.334
a couple days ago,
a woman drowned in, uh,

14:47.336 --> 14:49.569
bloody,
red saltwater.

14:49.571 --> 14:50.284
Like seawater?

14:50.308 --> 14:52.306
Yeah, except there's
no sea around here.

14:52.307 --> 14:54.541
And then, tonight,
a guy had his throat slit.

14:54.543 --> 14:56.343
Both bodies
were dumped in alleys.

14:56.345 --> 14:58.178
The murders happened
somewhere else.

14:58.180 --> 15:01.748
And both vics had
graffiti carved in them.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.617
- "Graffiti"?
- That's what the cops said.

15:04.553 --> 15:07.220
But, uh...

15:07.222 --> 15:08.555
it wasn't "graffiti."

15:11.994 --> 15:14.594
- Enochian.
- Yeah.

15:16.798 --> 15:19.366
- Yeah?
- Uh, sir, FBI.

15:19.368 --> 15:22.002
We're here to talk to you
about your brother, Alan.

15:26.775 --> 15:29.476
Oh. Well, definitely
brothers.

15:29.478 --> 15:31.678
Uh, Alan was my twin.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.812
I'm Eddie.

15:35.284 --> 15:38.985
I can't believe
he's gone.

15:38.987 --> 15:41.688
We were close.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.057
Best friends.

15:44.059 --> 15:46.993
Alan always said
he was my "big brother,"

15:46.995 --> 15:48.662
'cause he was born first.

15:50.632 --> 15:52.465
By, like, four minutes.

15:54.403 --> 15:57.103
Losing him is like
losing a part of myself.

15:58.974 --> 16:00.674
I never knew
it could be this bad.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.678
Cops said your brother
was connected to, uh,

16:04.680 --> 16:06.346
another victim.

16:06.348 --> 16:08.214
Yeah, I-I know. Uh...

16:08.216 --> 16:10.850
They both had that
graffiti carved in them.

16:10.852 --> 16:13.853
What kind of
monster does that?

16:13.855 --> 16:16.423
A-Actually,
it wasn't, um...

16:16.425 --> 16:19.059
It wasn't graffiti.
It was, uh...

16:19.061 --> 16:21.594
It was
an ancient language.

16:21.596 --> 16:23.263
It meant, um,

16:23.265 --> 16:24.531
"I am the Word."

16:26.735 --> 16:27.530
What?

16:27.554 --> 16:29.494
Was your brother
a very religious man?

16:30.238 --> 16:32.038
No. Not really.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.240
Did he know
anyone who was?

16:34.242 --> 16:36.943
Well, I mean, most of
the people we know, uh,

16:36.945 --> 16:40.513
they're
Church on Easter types...

16:40.515 --> 16:42.882
except --
- Except what?

16:42.884 --> 16:45.685
There's this guy,
Tony Alvarez.

16:45.687 --> 16:47.520
Him and Alan
were friends.

16:49.424 --> 16:51.157
He was always quoting stuff
that sounded like

16:51.159 --> 16:52.826
it came from the Bible.

16:56.565 --> 16:58.198
Can I see
that paper again?

16:58.200 --> 17:00.066
Of course.

17:04.705 --> 17:07.007
This is Tony...

17:07.009 --> 17:09.608
before he got too weird.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.778
There, on his arm.

17:14.715 --> 17:16.549
It's Enochian.

17:18.286 --> 17:19.652
It means "the Word."

17:26.028 --> 17:28.428
A killer who reads
and writes Enochian?

17:28.430 --> 17:30.130
M-Maybe some kind of
screwed-up angel?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.831
I suppose Tony could have said
"yes" and gotten possessed,

17:31.833 --> 17:33.466
but there aren't that many
angels around anymore.

17:33.468 --> 17:35.702
Well, no, angels aren't the only
ones who know Enochian.

17:39.207 --> 17:42.575
Dean! It's so good to hear from you.

17:42.577 --> 17:45.245
Okay. Well. Good.

17:45.247 --> 17:46.546
Uh
listen, Cass.

17:46.548 --> 17:48.481
Uh, Sam and I are
working this case.

17:48.483 --> 17:51.551
You're working a case?
That is so good to hear.

17:51.553 --> 17:53.486
So I assume that means you're
not going through with it,

17:53.488 --> 17:56.156
<i>because I have to say, Dean,</i>
<i>this plan of yours,</i>

17:56.158 --> 17:58.725
<i>it was born of -- of</i>
<i>desperation, not reason.</i>

17:58.727 --> 17:59.709
My "plan"?

17:59.733 --> 18:01.362
<i>I-I know that</i>
<i>I'm not supposed</i>

18:01.363 --> 18:03.229
<i>to know</i>
<i>what I know, but...</i>

18:03.231 --> 18:04.697
Look, I'm fine
with my plan, okay?

18:04.699 --> 18:06.933
<i>We can talk</i>
<i>about my plan later.</i>

18:06.935 --> 18:08.368
Dean.

18:08.370 --> 18:11.638
<i>You are making</i>
<i>a terrible mistake.</i>

18:11.640 --> 18:13.807
Does the name "Tony Alvarez"
mean anything to you?

18:14.943 --> 18:17.143
- Y-Yes.
- Say more.

18:17.145 --> 18:19.946
Antonio Alvarez is --

18:19.948 --> 18:23.349
is next in line to be prophet
when Donatello dies.

18:25.720 --> 18:28.021
- Okay. Thanks, Cass.
- Wait, Dean, Dean.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.589
<i>We need to have</i>
<i>a conversation.</i>

18:29.591 --> 18:31.091
Look, I really got to handle
this right now, okay?

18:31.093 --> 18:33.860
So thank you, and, uh...

18:33.862 --> 18:35.061
it's good
to hear your voice.

18:35.063 --> 18:36.529
Dean?

18:37.666 --> 18:39.599
- Really?
- Dean, it's Cass.

18:39.601 --> 18:41.134
I had to tell him.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.904
Well, it turns out
that Alan's friend Tony

18:44.906 --> 18:46.306
is a killer prophet.

18:46.308 --> 18:48.975
How's that
even possible?

18:50.312 --> 18:52.579
I guess anyone
can be a prophet, right?

18:53.376 --> 18:55.367
Not like there's a-a background
check or anything.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.384
Yeah, but before one
reveals itself,

18:58.386 --> 19:01.121
the previous one
has to die.

19:01.123 --> 19:02.722
So does that mean
Donatello's dead?

19:07.672 --> 19:09.273
Dr. Rashad?

19:09.275 --> 19:11.008
Hi. It's Dean Winchester.

19:11.010 --> 19:13.010
Yes, yeah. We --
W-We've spoken before.

19:13.012 --> 19:15.179
Uh, I'm Donatello Redfield's
nephew.

19:15.181 --> 19:17.548
Yeah, how is --
how is Donatello?

19:17.550 --> 19:19.450
He's, um...

19:19.452 --> 19:20.784
He's still
alive, right?

19:23.489 --> 19:24.788
Uh-huh.

19:24.790 --> 19:27.157
Well, Uncle Donny's
a fighter.

19:27.159 --> 19:28.626
You keep
me posted, okay?

19:29.395 --> 19:31.262
He's still with us.

19:31.264 --> 19:32.630
So, wait a second.

19:32.632 --> 19:34.398
I-If Donatello is still
technically online,

19:34.400 --> 19:37.001
then -- then why is
Tony Alvarez off the bench?

19:37.904 --> 19:39.937
Let's ask him.

19:44.544 --> 19:46.143
Tony Alvarez?

20:14.807 --> 20:17.374
Wow.

20:17.376 --> 20:20.277
Enochian 101.

20:20.279 --> 20:22.947
Looks like a whole semester
of Prophet-speak.

20:32.024 --> 20:34.124
Wow.

20:34.126 --> 20:35.826
Hey, check this out.

20:35.828 --> 20:37.494
Are these
future vics?

20:39.198 --> 20:42.032
I don't know.

20:42.034 --> 20:43.767
But these
look familiar.

20:43.769 --> 20:45.202
Hmm.

20:45.204 --> 20:46.737
Well,
he likes souvenirs.

20:46.739 --> 20:48.606
Explains how our lady Vic
drowned.

20:48.608 --> 20:50.307
Look at this.

20:51.877 --> 20:54.244
It's all "word of God"

20:54.246 --> 20:56.547
and
"divine retribution."

20:56.549 --> 20:59.249
I-I mean, slaughter
of firstborn sons,

20:59.251 --> 21:01.752
the -- the drowning of Egyptians
in the Red Sea...

21:01.754 --> 21:05.356
Wait, wait, wait. So, Alan was
the oldest of the twin, right?

21:05.358 --> 21:08.158
- Yeah.
- So firstborn.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.594
- Of course.
- And then she died

21:10.596 --> 21:12.763
in salty, bloody water.

21:12.765 --> 21:14.898
The "red sea."

21:14.900 --> 21:16.400
So then,
what's next up?

21:20.406 --> 21:21.905
Hey, Dean.

21:24.377 --> 21:27.778
"And there went out fire from
the Lord and devoured them."

21:31.584 --> 21:33.417
Hey, Sam.

21:33.419 --> 21:36.320
Check this out.

21:55.741 --> 21:59.043
Hey. Y-You don't
have to do this.

22:04.817 --> 22:07.651
You don't have
to do it.

22:11.624 --> 22:13.590
Whatever you what,
I'll give you anything.

22:16.195 --> 22:17.928
No!

22:17.930 --> 22:19.396
Let me go, please!

22:19.398 --> 22:20.964
"And the son of Aaron offered
strange fire to the Lord..."

22:20.966 --> 22:22.332
I'll do anything you want!

22:22.334 --> 22:23.901
- "...which he commanded them not."
- No!

22:23.903 --> 22:26.470
"There went out fire from
the Lord and devoured him

22:26.472 --> 22:28.439
and he died
before the Lord."

22:28.441 --> 22:29.740
What are you doing?

22:29.742 --> 22:31.675
Come back!
Please, come on!

22:31.677 --> 22:34.011
Whatever you want,
I-I'll give you anything!

22:34.013 --> 22:35.112
Please!

22:35.114 --> 22:36.980
The pain
becomes salvation.

22:36.982 --> 22:39.249
What are you doing?
No, no, no!

22:45.024 --> 22:49.159
No!

22:57.670 --> 23:01.438
Go on. Get out of here.
Go. Now.

23:03.042 --> 23:05.342
Sam? Sam!

23:08.748 --> 23:11.348
Tony Alvarez, right?

23:11.350 --> 23:12.649
And who are you?

23:14.920 --> 23:17.354
You can't --
You can't do this.

23:17.356 --> 23:19.623
I'm doing God's work.
I'm carrying out his orders.

23:19.625 --> 23:21.024
You think
God spoke to you?

23:21.026 --> 23:23.627
I-I've been chosen.
I hear his voice in my head.

23:23.629 --> 23:25.295
Yeah?
What's he saying now?

23:30.002 --> 23:31.702
Nothing.

23:31.704 --> 23:34.004
Yeah. 'Cause whatever
you heard,

23:34.006 --> 23:35.272
it wasn't God.

23:35.274 --> 23:38.675
Those people you killed
were innocent.

23:39.979 --> 23:41.478
Please!

23:42.615 --> 23:44.715
You're not chosen,
pal.

23:44.717 --> 23:46.416
You're just a psycho.

23:49.755 --> 23:53.690
No.

23:53.692 --> 23:55.192
So, what if he is hearing
something, right?

23:55.194 --> 23:56.660
I mean, what if, uh --
what if he's picking up

23:56.662 --> 23:58.962
some sort of vibe
from Donatello, you know?

23:58.964 --> 24:00.230
No, no...

24:00.232 --> 24:02.166
- Donatello's out cold.
-No...

24:02.168 --> 24:03.667
Yeah, so we think --
he's out cold.

24:04.804 --> 24:07.304
No!
No, no, no.

24:08.474 --> 24:10.340
Ohh!

24:10.342 --> 24:12.075
Ohh!

24:13.679 --> 24:15.779
He's got my gun!

24:15.781 --> 24:17.381
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

24:17.383 --> 24:18.949
No, no, no. Wait.

24:18.951 --> 24:21.852
Stop. Hey, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

24:24.456 --> 24:25.489
- No, no, no!
- Wait --

24:46.545 --> 24:49.479
So, then, this might
not end with Tony Alvarez.

24:49.481 --> 24:51.982
Because the next prophet's
gonna show up somewhere,

24:51.984 --> 24:55.219
a-and -- and the crazy
could start all over again.

24:55.221 --> 24:57.054
By the way, Cass...

24:57.056 --> 24:59.556
I thought there could only be
one prophet at a time.

24:59.558 --> 25:01.191
<i>Yeah, there should,</i>

25:01.193 --> 25:04.294
but Donatello is between
life and death.

25:04.296 --> 25:05.829
I mean, you know,
perhaps the next prophet

25:05.831 --> 25:07.664
was activated
before his time?

25:07.666 --> 25:10.667
- And went all Hannibal?
- <i>The natural order's been upset.</i>

25:10.669 --> 25:13.337
Perhaps Donatello's state
has created a prophet

25:13.339 --> 25:16.406
who's not only premature...

25:16.408 --> 25:17.875
but malformed.

25:17.877 --> 25:20.711
Okay. But if Tony was wired
wrong because of Donatello,

25:20.713 --> 25:23.146
then the next prophet
will be wired wrong, as well,

25:23.148 --> 25:26.350
and then the next and the next
and the -- the next and...

25:26.352 --> 25:27.985
How do we end this?

25:33.125 --> 25:34.625
You know how.

27:08.587 --> 27:09.786
Nick?

27:12.958 --> 27:15.158
Is that you?

27:15.160 --> 27:17.728
Yes, Nick.

27:17.730 --> 27:18.929
Lucifer?

27:22.067 --> 27:23.467
Sarah.

27:25.738 --> 27:27.270
Your wife.

27:32.673 --> 27:34.272
Sarah?

27:34.674 --> 27:37.175
As in the ghost
of Sarah?

27:37.177 --> 27:39.444
- Yes.
- I don't understand.

27:39.446 --> 27:41.179
What -- What are you
doing here?

27:41.181 --> 27:42.280
I never left.

27:42.282 --> 27:45.150
I'm held here
by unfinished business.

27:45.152 --> 27:46.479
Oh, my God.

27:46.503 --> 27:48.603
My unsolved murder,
and Teddy's.

27:48.688 --> 27:51.656
Sarah, I...

27:51.658 --> 27:52.924
I've missed you.

27:54.761 --> 27:58.530
I never thought
I'd see you again.

27:58.532 --> 28:00.064
I'm so sorry.

28:01.334 --> 28:03.768
No, Nick.

28:03.770 --> 28:05.403
You're not.

28:07.040 --> 28:10.742
But I found who killed you,
Sarah.

28:10.744 --> 28:13.511
A cop --
Frank Kellogg.

28:13.513 --> 28:15.780
I mean, not a cop --
a demon.

28:15.782 --> 28:18.249
It's not Frank --
it's, uh, Abraxas.

28:18.251 --> 28:20.452
Uh, it's confusing,
but I found him.

28:20.454 --> 28:22.921
I killed him.
It. Whatever.

28:22.923 --> 28:26.124
I got you justice, Sarah.

28:26.126 --> 28:28.760
You're free.
You could leave.

28:28.762 --> 28:30.495
And what about
Lucifer?

28:30.497 --> 28:32.664
What about him?
He's dead.

28:32.666 --> 28:34.566
My unfinished
business

28:34.568 --> 28:36.534
isn't just about
how I died, Nick.

28:38.805 --> 28:40.171
It's <i> you.</i>

28:43.243 --> 28:45.143
I was here that night.

28:45.145 --> 28:47.078
I saw what
he did to you. I...

28:49.916 --> 28:51.883
You chose Lucifer.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.720
You wanted him.
You...

28:59.526 --> 29:02.026
You still do.

29:02.028 --> 29:05.029
He chose me, okay?

29:05.031 --> 29:08.766
You didn't come here
to find peace.

29:08.768 --> 29:11.069
You came here
to find <i> him</i>

29:11.071 --> 29:14.339
in the place where you
became one with him.

29:14.341 --> 29:15.540
No.

29:15.542 --> 29:17.242
Then show me I'm wrong.

29:17.244 --> 29:20.245
Reject Lucifer
right now.

29:20.247 --> 29:23.014
If you do,
I can leave.

29:23.016 --> 29:25.049
I can find peace.

29:34.461 --> 29:36.094
Reject him, Nick.

29:41.635 --> 29:43.835
Please.

29:43.837 --> 29:45.203
Please!

29:48.308 --> 29:49.908
I-I can't.

29:52.779 --> 29:54.546
I'm sorry.

29:56.349 --> 29:58.316
You can't.

29:59.686 --> 30:02.453
Because you <i> are</i> him.

30:04.558 --> 30:07.825
You doomed me
to stay in this place forever.

30:10.664 --> 30:13.932
You've doomed yourself.

30:13.934 --> 30:15.733
I know.

30:19.639 --> 30:21.306
I'm sorry.

30:24.778 --> 30:26.177
Where are you
going?

30:29.749 --> 30:32.116
Wherever it's darkest.

30:32.118 --> 30:33.618
Wherever he is.

30:36.189 --> 30:37.789
Nick!

30:44.998 --> 30:47.532
Dr. - You're making the right choice.

30:47.534 --> 30:49.934
Your uncle's in a persistent
vegetative state,

30:49.936 --> 30:53.705
being kept alive by machinery
and nothing else.

30:53.707 --> 30:56.441
Sometimes letting go
is the right choice.

30:57.944 --> 30:59.444
Tell me about it.

30:59.446 --> 31:02.447
Just coincidental, you all
being here at the same time.

31:04.050 --> 31:06.317
Dr. Novak,
meet, uh --

31:06.319 --> 31:07.518
Yes, I know.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.953
I know these gentlemen.

31:08.955 --> 31:12.790
Mr. Winchester
and the other Mr. Winchester.

31:12.792 --> 31:15.393
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

31:15.395 --> 31:16.928
So, Dr. Rashad,
you were saying

31:16.930 --> 31:19.631
there's been no improvement
with our uncle?

31:19.633 --> 31:23.067
That's right. There's no real
brain activity to speak of.

31:23.069 --> 31:26.070
Um, nothing beyond
the occasional muscle spasm

31:26.072 --> 31:27.605
or, uh,
babble of words.

31:29.376 --> 31:30.875
Strictly reflexive.

31:30.877 --> 31:32.710
W-What kind of
babbled word?

31:32.712 --> 31:34.178
Follow me.

31:37.350 --> 31:39.884
So, "Doctor," checking in
on old Uncle Donny, huh?

31:39.886 --> 31:41.419
Hey, Dean.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.821
What happened to him --
that was my fault.

31:43.823 --> 31:44.989
It was necessary.

31:44.991 --> 31:46.624
But doesn't mean
I don't regret it.

31:46.626 --> 31:47.859
It doesn't mean that
I don't wish that

31:47.861 --> 31:49.761
there could've been
another way.

31:49.763 --> 31:51.362
I know the feeling.

31:51.364 --> 31:52.697
Oh, no.

31:52.699 --> 31:54.899
No, please
don't compare this

31:54.901 --> 31:57.435
with your
suicidal plan.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.037
- Just stop.
-Okay. All right.

31:59.039 --> 32:00.471
Why don't we
talk about that later?

32:00.473 --> 32:02.473
Because,
according to your plan,

32:02.475 --> 32:04.609
there won't be a later.

32:04.611 --> 32:08.212
Cass...if you were
a friend of mine,

32:08.214 --> 32:09.847
then you will understand
that I have to do this

32:09.849 --> 32:11.916
and you won't
try to stop me.

32:11.918 --> 32:14.752
You think
this is easy on me?

32:14.754 --> 32:16.354
It has to be done.

32:16.356 --> 32:19.057
So, then,
this is goodbye?

32:21.928 --> 32:23.695
Guys.

32:23.697 --> 32:25.296
Check this out.

32:25.298 --> 32:27.198
Okay, so, a couple days ago,
Donatello started making

32:27.200 --> 32:29.500
some, uh,
random noises.

32:29.502 --> 32:31.869
Uh, Dr. Rashad thought
he might be coming out of it,

32:31.871 --> 32:34.405
so he shot this video.

32:35.508 --> 32:38.910
<i>Boh ray,</i>
<i>kah lah teh nee hoh.</i>

32:38.912 --> 32:42.346
<i>Rah may lah ray kee doh.</i>

32:42.348 --> 32:44.182
That's Enochian.

32:44.184 --> 32:45.650
He's saying,
"I will strike down

32:45.652 --> 32:48.486
the firstborn
in the land of Egypt.

32:48.488 --> 32:50.154
I-I will execute
judgment."

32:50.156 --> 32:51.522
Well, that's
the same thing that

32:51.524 --> 32:53.291
that screwed-up
new prophet was spouting.

32:53.293 --> 32:56.861
Donatello's mind
is fighting to rebuild.

32:56.863 --> 33:00.531
It's -- It's like he's trying
to organize his...

33:00.533 --> 33:02.633
his memories,
the words of God.

33:02.635 --> 33:05.603
So that's what Tony
was picking up on.

33:05.605 --> 33:08.239
Well, then,
I-I can fix him.

33:08.241 --> 33:10.241
Wait. How?
I thought he was too far gone.

33:10.243 --> 33:13.411
Dean,
if there's a spark --

33:13.413 --> 33:17.014
a hope --
then I have to try.

33:17.016 --> 33:18.516
<i>You</i> taught me that.

33:22.021 --> 33:23.755
Get out.

33:23.757 --> 33:25.356
What?

33:25.358 --> 33:26.657
You heard him.

33:26.659 --> 33:28.459
You said you wanted
to discontinue treatments.

33:28.461 --> 33:29.827
And now we've changed
our minds.

33:29.829 --> 33:31.462
Look, if there's a chance
that Donatello

33:31.464 --> 33:33.197
could fight through this,
then we're gonna take it.

33:33.199 --> 33:35.399
He ain't leaving the party
if the music's still playing.

33:35.401 --> 33:36.400
Clear?

33:44.210 --> 33:46.110
You all right?

33:49.149 --> 33:52.650
If Cass isn't right
about Donatello,

33:52.652 --> 33:54.452
then where does
that leave him?

33:54.454 --> 33:55.553
Trapped.

33:55.555 --> 33:56.788
Trapped
in his own body

33:56.790 --> 33:58.723
somewhere between
life and death.

34:00.660 --> 34:03.561
It's just tough to think about
somebody going through that.

34:03.563 --> 34:05.663
Then don't.

34:05.665 --> 34:08.132
Thinking --
highly overrated.

34:08.134 --> 34:09.567
Easy for you
to say.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.536
No, it's not,
actually.

34:11.538 --> 34:14.138
Whatever's gonna happen with
Donatello, we'll know soon.

34:17.377 --> 34:19.409
Right.

34:19.411 --> 34:20.745
And then what?

34:22.748 --> 34:25.416
Nothing's changed, Sam.

34:37.563 --> 34:39.030
Hey.

34:40.199 --> 34:41.532
Anything?

34:42.869 --> 34:45.402
Something.

34:45.405 --> 34:47.138
Something uncertain.

34:48.474 --> 34:50.775
Well, what exactly
are you looking for?

34:55.849 --> 34:58.082
That.

34:58.084 --> 34:59.383
Donatello?

35:03.623 --> 35:06.557
We should turn off
these machines.

35:06.559 --> 35:08.059
Whoa. Wait, wait.

35:10.263 --> 35:11.429
He could die.

35:11.431 --> 35:13.130
There's only one way
to find out.

35:54.774 --> 35:56.674
Hey.

35:56.676 --> 35:58.676
Welcome back, champ.

35:58.678 --> 36:00.311
Dean?

36:00.313 --> 36:01.979
Get him his glasses.

36:11.124 --> 36:13.291
Now, look at that.

36:15.328 --> 36:16.961
It's a miracle.

36:27.702 --> 36:29.035
Um...

36:29.037 --> 36:31.571
Would you like
more grape Jell-O?

36:31.573 --> 36:33.473
Well, a-actually,
I'd prefer

36:33.475 --> 36:35.308
a bucket of extra-crispy
buffalo wings

36:35.310 --> 36:36.776
with a side
of Tex-Mex sauce.

36:36.778 --> 36:40.747
Okay. Take it easy, cowboy.
You just got back.

36:41.716 --> 36:43.549
He <i> is</i> back,
isn't he?

36:43.551 --> 36:46.819
I mean, this isn't some kind
of evil, weird version?

36:46.821 --> 36:49.622
No. This is the --
the regular him.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.924
But, um...he --

36:51.926 --> 36:53.726
he -- he doesn't
have a soul.

36:53.728 --> 36:54.694
Hm.

36:54.696 --> 36:56.863
Well,
nobody's perfect.

36:56.865 --> 36:58.731
Guys, w-what happened?

36:58.733 --> 37:01.701
Did I work too much?
Overload on Enochian?

37:01.703 --> 37:02.902
Hm.

37:04.539 --> 37:06.272
Cass will
catch you up.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.245
Jell-O?

37:20.388 --> 37:23.189
Where's the party?

37:23.191 --> 37:25.758
It's right here.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.427
I mean, we're celebrating,
right?

37:28.963 --> 37:31.564
- Okay.
- Yeah, but not too much.

37:31.566 --> 37:34.300
Tomorrow morning,
we're, uh, back on track.

37:34.302 --> 37:37.003
No rest for
the self-destructive.

37:38.573 --> 37:41.407
Well, I would
call this a win.

37:41.409 --> 37:44.510
Kind of nice.
We're going out on a high.

37:44.512 --> 37:47.213
"Going out" being
the operative phrase.

37:47.215 --> 37:48.281
Sorry.

37:48.283 --> 37:49.982
"Sorry."

37:49.984 --> 37:51.317
How sorry are you?

37:51.319 --> 37:53.886
Sorry that you fight
to keep Donatello alive,

37:53.888 --> 37:55.655
but when it
comes to you,

37:55.657 --> 37:57.423
you just
throw in the towel?

37:58.927 --> 38:01.127
Or are you sorry that,
after all these years,

38:01.129 --> 38:04.263
our entire lives,
a-after I've looked up to you,

38:04.265 --> 38:08.301
after I've learned from you,
I-I-I've copied you,

38:08.303 --> 38:10.603
I followed you
to Hell and back,

38:10.605 --> 38:11.938
are you sorry
that all of that --

38:11.940 --> 38:13.306
it -- it --
it means nothing now?

38:13.308 --> 38:15.508
- Who's saying that?
-You are,

38:15.510 --> 38:18.077
when you tell me
I have to kill you.

38:18.079 --> 38:21.447
When you're telling me
that I have to just throw away

38:21.449 --> 38:23.516
everything we stand for,

38:23.518 --> 38:26.953
throw away faith,
throw away family.

38:27.989 --> 38:30.156
We're the guys
who save the world.

38:30.158 --> 38:32.492
We don't just
check out of it!

38:34.529 --> 38:37.864
Sam, I have
tried everything.

38:37.866 --> 38:39.799
Everything!

38:39.801 --> 38:42.568
I got one card left to play,
and I have to play it.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.904
You have
one card <i> today!</i>

38:44.906 --> 38:46.472
But we'll find
another tomorrow.

38:46.474 --> 38:49.408
But if you quit on us today,
there won't be no tomorrow!

38:49.410 --> 38:52.145
You tell me, uh, you don't know
what else to do.

38:52.147 --> 38:54.413
I don't either, Dean.
Not yet.

38:54.415 --> 38:57.183
But what you're doing now,
i-it's -- it's wrong!

38:57.185 --> 38:58.751
It's quitting!

39:00.221 --> 39:02.655
I mean, l-look
what just happened.

39:02.657 --> 39:04.657
Donatello never
quit fighting.

39:04.659 --> 39:07.026
So we could help him
because he gave up.

39:11.366 --> 39:13.766
<i>I</i> believe
in us, Dean.

39:21.476 --> 39:23.543
I believe in us.

39:23.545 --> 39:25.378
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

39:27.582 --> 39:30.650
Why don't you
believe in us, too?

39:41.362 --> 39:42.695
Okay, Sam.

39:46.701 --> 39:49.168
Let's go home.

39:49.170 --> 39:50.536
What?

40:00.114 --> 40:01.447
Let's go home.

40:04.085 --> 40:06.485
Maybe
Billie's wrong.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.687
Maybe.

40:09.591 --> 40:11.624
But I do
believe in us.

40:15.630 --> 40:17.363
I believe
in all of us.

40:20.902 --> 40:23.569
And I'll keep believing
until I can't.

40:24.873 --> 40:26.973
Until there's absolutely
no other way.

40:32.814 --> 40:34.280
But when
that day comes --

40:34.282 --> 40:37.183
<i>if</i> that day comes...

40:38.353 --> 40:41.921
...Sam, you have to take it
for what it is --

40:41.923 --> 40:43.122
the end.

40:45.560 --> 40:48.628
And you have
to promise me

40:48.630 --> 40:51.697
that you'll do then
what you can't do now,

40:51.699 --> 40:54.066
and that's let me go.

40:54.068 --> 40:55.835
And put me
in that box.

40:58.072 --> 40:59.372
You, too.

41:05.046 --> 41:07.847
Yeah, all right.
All right.

41:07.849 --> 41:09.115
All right.

41:12.420 --> 41:14.520
Now, you heard me.
Let's go home.

41:15.423 --> 41:17.957
Just don't hit me
again, okay?
