I'm at my biggest ever event.

26:40.224 --> 26:43.933
Pre-sold, full capacity,
hundreds of people with...

26:44.015 --> 26:46.474
more shows pre-sold
to thousands more.

26:46.557 --> 26:49.391
And as part of my show,
right in the beginning,

26:49.474 --> 26:51.683
I pull someone up from the crowd

26:51.766 --> 26:53.599
and they tell me their problem.

26:53.683 --> 26:55.325
I give them a few words,
and they're happy.

26:55.349 --> 26:57.516
The crowd's happy,
and we're off to a great start.

26:57.599 --> 26:59.599
So, I pull someone up.

26:59.683 --> 27:01.099
Nice woman,

27:01.182 --> 27:03.349
lovely smile. Jackie.

27:04.808 --> 27:06.766
And Jackie says that
her beloved husband,

27:06.849 --> 27:08.683
Brad, died a few weeks ago.

27:08.766 --> 27:12.307
So, I go into
condolence mode, but no.

27:12.766 --> 27:14.683
She doesn't want that
because the reason

27:14.766 --> 27:16.474
Brad died, she says,

27:16.557 --> 27:18.432
is because he killed himself

27:18.516 --> 27:20.724
as a result of
a mental breakdown

27:21.349 --> 27:23.557
shortly after
coming off his meds.

27:23.641 --> 27:26.224
And the reason Brad
came off his meds,

27:26.307 --> 27:29.933
according to Jackie,
is because I told him to.

27:33.599 --> 27:36.766
- You didn't say that?
- Not literally, no.

27:37.140 --> 27:40.224
- Not literally?
- And so, I started to sweat.

27:40.849 --> 27:42.265
And I heard this voice...

27:42.349 --> 27:44.307
It was my voice, but it
was, like, disembodied,

27:44.391 --> 27:47.099
like it was somebody
else's voice, you know?

27:48.516 --> 27:50.474
And I think it said,

27:50.557 --> 27:52.182
"Do you know what, Jackie?

27:52.391 --> 27:54.057
"You're right.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.974
"Who am I to be preaching
at you like this?

27:56.057 --> 27:58.641
"I'm a 37-year-old man

27:58.724 --> 28:00.683
"without a life or a girlfriend

28:00.766 --> 28:04.265
"or even a proper home.
I'm a fuckin' fraud,

28:04.349 --> 28:06.683
"and I am as guilty of
your husband's death

28:06.766 --> 28:09.391
as if I had killed him myself."

28:10.391 --> 28:12.849
And then I told
them all to go home.

28:17.641 --> 28:19.557
And this was...

28:19.641 --> 28:22.182
10 minutes into
a three-day event,

28:22.265 --> 28:24.099
by the way,

28:24.766 --> 28:25.974
so that went down well.

28:26.057 --> 28:27.641
And now, there are memes of me,

28:27.724 --> 28:29.641
and I think I'm just
becoming like a bit of a...

28:29.724 --> 28:31.474
- A laughingstock.
- Scapegoat.

28:32.265 --> 28:34.432
- Um... Yeah.
- Huh?

28:36.015 --> 28:39.265
No, I guess laughingstock's
about right.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.432
If you want to go home,
I'll understand.

28:50.516 --> 28:53.808
But I'll tell you one thing,
absolutely honestly.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.641
