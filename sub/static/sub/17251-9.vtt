WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:03.304
- SPEED KILLS.

00:03.337 --> 00:04.905
YOU HEAR THAT A LOT OUT
IN THE WORLD.

00:04.938 --> 00:08.309
DON'T RUSH. TAKE YOUR TIME.
SPEED KILLS.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.679
BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE AN E.M.T.,
YOU WANT TO BE ONE OF US,

00:11.712 --> 00:13.647
YOU GOT TO LEARN
A DIFFERENT RULE.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.717
SPEED SAVES.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.086
SPEED SAVES.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.921
- NO, SIR.
JESUS SAVES.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.756
- SPEED SAVES.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.326
JESUS HELPS.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.096
- EVERY DAY, WE ANSWER ANYWHERE
FROM 5 TO 15 CALLS.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.664
A LOT OF 'EM ARE JUST WHAT
WE CALL "MILK RUNS."

00:30.698 --> 00:32.833
- OLD LADY GETS MOVED
FROM HER LONG-TERM APARTMENT

00:32.866 --> 00:35.236
INTO LONG-TERM ELDERLY HOUSING.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.704
- A HYPOCHONDRIAC
WITH HEART PALPITATIONS.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.239
TURNS OUT IT'S JUST GAS.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.841
- AND SOMETIMES YOU GOT
THE LIFE-AND-DEATH DEALS--

00:40.874 --> 00:44.945
CAR CRASHES, GUNSHOT VICTIMS,
DRUG OVERDOSES.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.680
EVERY SECOND COUNTS--

00:46.714 --> 00:50.084
EACH ONE LIKE A BOMB
ABOUT TO GO OFF.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.720
NOW, YOU MIGHT THINK
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM

00:52.753 --> 00:55.189
TO DEFUSE ONE
OF THOSE BOMBS,

00:55.223 --> 00:59.460
BUT EVERY TIME YOU DEFUSE ONE,
ANOTHER BOMB POPS UP,

00:59.493 --> 01:02.029
TICKING, WAITING TO EXPLODE.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.531
- TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE,

01:03.564 --> 01:05.599
WE'RE GONNA WALK YOU THROUGH
A SHIFT WE HAD

01:05.633 --> 01:07.235
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.470
IT STARTED OUT A DAY
LIKE ANY OTHER DAY.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.573
- TOP THREE FIRST LADIES
YOU'D SLEEP WITH IN THEIR PRIME?

01:12.606 --> 01:14.242
- JACKIE KENNEDY,
MICHELLE OBAMA,

01:14.275 --> 01:15.976
AND LAURA BUSH
AS A LIBRARIAN,

01:16.009 --> 01:19.079
IN THE LIBRARY,
IN THE CHRISTIANITY SECTION.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.414
GO.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.649
- BARBARA BUSH.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.252
- BARBARA BUSH?
SHE NEVER HAD A PRIME.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.919
SHE ALWAYS LOOKED LIKE
GEORGE FRICKIN' WASHINGTON.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.621
- EXACTLY, AND GEORGE WAS
A SLAVE OWNER,

01:27.655 --> 01:31.325
SO IT'D BE LIKE A GRUDGE-HUMP...
FOR MY PEOPLE.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.327
- WOULD YOU EVER BLOW
ABRAHAM LINCOLN?

01:33.361 --> 01:34.928
- DANIEL-DAY LINCOLN, YES.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.397
REAL LIFE LINCOLN, NO.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.098
FREEDOM OR NOT,
I DO HAVE SOME STANDARDS.

01:38.132 --> 01:39.933
- I ALWAYS ADMIRED
ROSALYNN CARTER.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.002
SHE WORE VERY SENSIBLE SHOES.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.276
- [laughs]
- [groans]

01:48.309 --> 01:51.645
- WHAT HAPPENED, BUDDY?
- TEAMWORK IS EVERYTHING.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.247
- STERILE SWABS.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.748
- 85.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.185
- WIDE-GAUGE SHARPS.
- 44.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.687
- NARROW-GAUGE SHARPS.
- 30.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.922
- THAT LOW?
BETTER COUNT AGAIN.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.357
- 30.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.025
- VOO.
- ALREADY ORDERING MORE.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.495
- AND FIND A NEW SANDWICH SHOP
IN BUCKTOWN.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.297
- FOUND IT. PUT YOUR ORDER IN
TEN MINUTES AGO.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.598
- ITALIAN BEEF?
- YOU GOT IT.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.999
- MY GIRL.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.467
- IT'S ACTUALLY BIGGER
THAN A TEAM.

02:13.501 --> 02:16.504
SEE, WITH A TEAM,
A GUY CAN DEMAND A TRADE

02:16.537 --> 02:18.439
OR HOLD OUT FOR MORE MONEY,
BUT WITH US,

02:18.472 --> 02:20.808
WHEN A CREW'S BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH,

02:20.841 --> 02:23.143
THEY BECOME
SOMETHING STRONGER.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.812
THEY BECOME A FAMILY.

02:24.845 --> 02:28.316
ONE DOZEN BAVARIAN CREAMS,
LADIES AND GERMS,

02:28.349 --> 02:31.652
FROM CHICAGO'S FINEST GOURMET
DOUGHNUT SHOP--

02:31.685 --> 02:32.820
GLAZED AND INFUSED.

02:32.853 --> 02:33.821
GOOGLE IT, BITCHES.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.289
YEP, THAT'S RIGHT.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.358
THANK YOU, UNCLE JOHNNY.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

02:39.493 --> 02:43.063
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE MY BACK...

02:43.096 --> 02:47.568
PEOPLE WITHOUT WHOM
I COULD NOT DO MY JOB...

02:47.601 --> 02:51.872
THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE ME WANT TO
PUT ON THIS UNIFORM EVERY DAY.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.345
AND I LOVE THESE PEOPLE.
I LOVE THIS FAMILY.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.679
OH!

02:58.712 --> 03:01.181
YOU'VE GOT TO BE SH------ ME.

03:01.215 --> 03:04.352
OKAY, ASSHOLES, WHO TOOK
THE LAST GODDAMN DOUGHNUT?

03:04.385 --> 03:07.255
[hip-hop music]

03:07.288 --> 03:15.429
*

03:27.808 --> 03:30.678
- EVERYONE ON THE TEAM,
EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY,

03:30.711 --> 03:35.349
EVERY E.M.T. ON EVERY RIG,
EACH ONE BRINGS SOME TALENT

03:35.383 --> 03:37.217
THAT CAN HELP SAVE A LIFE.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.052
- WELL, WE KNOW I BRING
THE DOUGHNUTS.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.521
- AND SPEED AND DECISIVENESS

03:40.554 --> 03:41.855
IN CERTAIN LIFE-AND-DEATH
SITUATIONS,

03:41.889 --> 03:43.056
WHICH I REALLY ADMIRE.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.091
- THANK YOU, HANK.
- HUH.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.459
AND THEN I BRING THE MUSCLE.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.261
- AND THE MEDICAL KNOW-HOW.
- OH.

03:47.295 --> 03:50.664
- SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE LIKE
AN E.M.T. ENCYCLOPEDIA.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.536
- [clears throat]

03:55.569 --> 03:56.970
AND WHAT IS IT

03:57.004 --> 04:00.708
THAT YOU GUYS
WOULD SAY THAT I BRING?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.277
- OH, UM...
- OH...

04:03.311 --> 04:04.612
YOU ARE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC.
- YES.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.747
- YES!
YES, I BRING THE ENTHUSIASM.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.282
- AND THE GUM.
- YES, I DO!

04:08.316 --> 04:10.318
I BRING THE GUM.
- YOU BROUGHT THE GUM, RIGHT?

04:10.351 --> 04:13.120
- YES, IT'S A NEW KIND
WHERE THE FLAVOR DOESN'T RUN OUT

04:13.153 --> 04:15.255
BEFORE YOU'VE CHEWED IT
FIVE TIMES.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.791
- GODDAMN FRUIT STRIPE.
- THAT SH-- BIT IT HARD.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.727
- THIS IS, UH--
IT'S SUPPOSED TO LAST FOREVER.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.128
IT'S CALLED TRIPLE TASTE...
- OKAY.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.730
- AND IT LASTS
THREE TIMES LONGER.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.098
- OKAY.

04:25.132 --> 04:28.235
- AND BLAST OFF.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.970
- MMM.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.572
- [laughs]
- WOW.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.641
- IT'S GREAT.
- WELCOME TO FLAVOR COUNTRY.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.743
YEAH, IT'S LIKE
A CHEWABLE FRUIT BASKET.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.977
- THE SECOND ACT--
IS THAT HONEYDEW?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.646
- YEAH, MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.013
- LITTLE POMEGRANATE?
- OH, YEAH.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.315
NO, I GOT THE POMEGRANATE
BIG-TIME.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.650
- WE'RE JUST ONE PART
OF THE MACHINERY

04:42.683 --> 04:43.951
THAT KEEPS PEOPLE ALIVE,

04:43.984 --> 04:45.653
AND WE HAVE CONNECTIONS
TO OTHER PARTS

04:45.686 --> 04:47.254
OF THAT MACHINERY.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.022
LIKE, MY FATHER WAS A FIREMAN
FOR THREE DECADES.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.425
MY GIRLFRIEND--
- EX-GIRLFRIEND.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.527
- HOT EX-GIRLFRIEND.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.796
- OH, VERY, VERY HOT.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.332
- MY VERY, VERY,
VERY HOT EX-GIRLFRIEND,

04:58.366 --> 04:59.767
WHO'S STILL
KIND OF MY GIRLFRIEND,

04:59.800 --> 05:01.535
EVEN THOUGH
WE SORT OF BROKE UP,

05:01.569 --> 05:05.806
AND IS NOW BEING OBJECTIFIED
BY MY COWORKERS, BRIAN...

05:05.839 --> 05:07.140
IS A COP.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.677
AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
THAT JOB COMES

05:09.710 --> 05:11.779
WITH SPECIAL STRESSES
ALL ITS OWN.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.481
- [grunts]

05:13.514 --> 05:15.215
[sighs]

05:15.248 --> 05:16.717
- GUN.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.552
- AAH!

05:18.586 --> 05:21.054
- DEALING IN LIFE AND DEATH
ALL DAY

05:21.088 --> 05:23.657
CAN PUT TERRIBLE PRESSURE
ON YOUR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.158
- MEXICAN.
- CHINESE.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.527
- NO, MEXICAN.
- COME ON.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.795
I'M CRAVING CHINESE.
- NO!

05:27.828 --> 05:29.196
MY DAY SUCKED.
I NEED GUACAMOLE.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.498
- YOUR DAY SUCKED?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.366
WE HAD TWO HEART ATTACK
VICTIMS TODAY.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.568
- ONE AGGRAVATED ASSAULT,
ONE ATTEMPTED ROBBERY.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.504
- CONSTRUCTION WORKER
WITH A METAL ROD

05:36.537 --> 05:38.205
IMPALED IN HIS NECK,
90 STITCHES.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.307
- I CHASED TWO DRUG DEALERS
5 1/2 BLOCKS.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.742
- THAT'S JUST GOOD CARDIO.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.844
- AND THEY SHOT AT ME.
- THAT'S A LIE.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.746
YOU WOULD HAVE LED WITH THAT.
- OH, BUT THEY COULD HAVE!

05:45.779 --> 05:47.347
- YEAH, BUT BY THAT LOGIC,

05:47.381 --> 05:49.517
YOU'D GET TO PICK DINNER
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.918
YEAH.
- YOU KNOW...

05:50.951 --> 05:52.252
TEQUILA MAKES ME HORNY.
- LIKE I SAID, MEXICAN.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.158
- YOU GOT TO HAVE RESPECT
FOR EACH OTHER

05:58.191 --> 05:59.393
AND RESPECT FOR THE RULES
AND REGULATIONS

05:59.427 --> 06:01.061
AND THE UNWRITTEN RULES.

06:01.094 --> 06:04.532
THERE ARE ALWAYS UNWRITTEN RULES
IN EVERY FAMILY.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.833
- AND JAY CUTLER'S SHOULDER

06:05.866 --> 06:07.568
WILL BE EXAMINED TODAY
BY TEAM DOCTORS

06:07.601 --> 06:09.603
FOR ANY EVIDENCE
OF SERIOUS DAMAGE.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.672
- SH--.
- WE LOSE CUTLER, WE'RE DONE.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.006
- DONE-DONE.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.342
- SO, UH,
DID HE HURT HIS, UH--

06:15.375 --> 06:18.011
- WHOA!
- WHOA!

06:18.045 --> 06:19.012
WHAT THE HELL
YOU THINK YOU DOING?

06:19.046 --> 06:20.280
- I WAS JUST--

06:20.313 --> 06:21.749
- WHO TOLD YOU
YOU COULD SIT THERE?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.350
- IS SOMEBODY SITTING THERE?
both: NO.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.518
- OH, WELL, THEN--

06:24.552 --> 06:26.587
- [laughs]
- HOLY SH--!

06:26.620 --> 06:28.188
- WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.923
- YOU'VE BROKEN
THEIR LITTLE SEATING CHART.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.258
- IT'S NOT A SEATING CHART.
- IT'S A HIERARCHY.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.259
- IT'S A POWER STRUCTURE.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.894
- CASH SITS IN THE CHAIR.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.029
I SIT HERE.
JOHNNY SITS THERE.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.098
THE SPACE BETWEEN US
IS THE NEUTRAL ZONE.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.200
- THE ALL-IMPORTANT
NEUTRAL ZONE.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.802
- WHY DO YOU NEED
A NEUTRAL ZONE?

06:41.835 --> 06:44.271
[laughter]

06:44.304 --> 06:45.906
- WHY DO WE NEED
A NEUTRAL ZONE?

06:45.939 --> 06:48.075
IF YOU HAVE TO ASK WHY WE NEED
A NEUTRAL ZONE,

06:48.108 --> 06:49.810
YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT PART
OF THE POWER STRUCTURE.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.112
- IN TWO YEARS,
IF YOU WORK OUT,

06:52.145 --> 06:54.081
WE MIGHT INVITE YOU TO SIT
ON THE COUCH WITH US.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.282
- MIGHT.
- REALLY?

06:55.315 --> 06:56.817
IS THAT--
IS THAT TRUE, CASH?

06:56.850 --> 07:00.153
- KEVIN, IF YOU SIT
ON THAT COUCH AGAIN UNINVITED,

07:00.187 --> 07:02.422
I WILL SET YOUR FACE ON FIRE.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.092
- BRIAN, YOU CAN COME SIT
OVER HERE WITH US.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.261
ALL THESE CHAIRS ARE OPEN...

07:08.295 --> 07:12.466
EXCEPT I SIT IN THIS ONE
AND DON'T SIT IN THAT ONE.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.968
[groans]

07:15.002 --> 07:16.904
THEY THINK I'M AFRAID
OF THAT COUCH.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.472
IT'S NOT THAT.

07:18.506 --> 07:22.743
I'M AFRAID OF ALL COUCHES...
EVERYWHERE.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.344
- I'M AFRAID OF THAT COUCH.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.146
FIVE YEARS' WORTH OF HANK
AND JOHNNY'S FARTS

07:26.179 --> 07:27.447
STORED UP IN THOSE CUSHIONS.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.683
- HENCE THE NEUTRAL ZONE.
- YEAH.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.151
- REAL POWER DOES NOT LIE

07:31.184 --> 07:33.120
IN THE INANE SEATING SITUATION
YOU HAVE, BOYS.

07:33.153 --> 07:37.457
IT LIES IN MY OFFICE,
BECAUSE I AM THE VOICE OF GOD.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.692
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR COUCH.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.529
I HAVE MY THRONE
AND MY YOGA BALL

07:41.562 --> 07:43.664
FOR WHEN MY SCIATICA ACTS UP.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.766
IT'S A HUMBLING JOB.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.335
WHOEVER YOU ARE WHEN YOU WALK
THROUGH THAT DOOR--

07:48.368 --> 07:51.371
MAN, WOMAN, HOT SH--,
DORK OF ALL DORKS--

07:51.404 --> 07:53.440
ONCE YOU'RE HERE,
YOU ARE JUST ONE OF US,

07:53.473 --> 07:55.776
A COG IN THE MACHINE.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.478
AND THE ONLY THING
YOU ARE JUDGED BY IS...

07:58.512 --> 08:01.281
- YOUR SPEED.
- YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE

08:01.314 --> 08:05.485
SWIFT DECISIONS IN THE FACE
OF CATASTROPHIC EMERGENCIES.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.487
- I SAID
THE SAME THING FASTER.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.289
- YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED
TO FUNCTION,

08:09.322 --> 08:12.893
EVEN IN THE MIDST OF
THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE HORRORS.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.662
- GUY WHO JUST GOT
OUT OF A CHEMICAL FIRE,

08:14.695 --> 08:16.830
MELTED EYEBALLS DRIPPING
DOWN HIS CHEEKS,

08:16.864 --> 08:18.566
ASKING, "WHO TURNED OUT
THE LIGHTS?"

08:18.599 --> 08:20.133
- THAT IS ONE EXAMPLE.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.869
- TEENAGE GIRL CARRYING
A HOT BOWL OF RAMEN

08:21.902 --> 08:23.470
WIPES OUT
WHILE WALKING DOWN A SET

08:23.503 --> 08:25.338
OF CEMENT
COMMUNITY-COLLEGE STAIRS,

08:25.372 --> 08:27.474
AND YOU HAVE TO GET HER BRAINS
BACK INTO HER SKULL,

08:27.507 --> 08:29.309
BUT NOT THE NOODLES.
- VOO.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.812
- FAT MAN WHO WEIGHS
1,300 POUNDS HAS A HEART ATTACK

08:31.845 --> 08:34.147
AND HAS TO BE TRANSPORTED
TO THE HOSPITAL,

08:34.181 --> 08:37.384
AND YOU GET SIX E.M.T.s
INTO THE FILTHY, RAT-INFESTED

08:37.417 --> 08:39.519
MESS OF AN APARTMENT
TO TRY TO MOVE HIM.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.488
AND FIRST YOU FIND
AN OLD SANDWICH IN A FAT FOLD...

08:41.521 --> 08:42.690
- VAL.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.224
- AND THEN
ONCE YOU ROLL HIM OVER--

08:44.257 --> 08:45.392
- VAL!

08:45.425 --> 08:46.727
- YOU SAID I SHOULD SCARE 'EM.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.928
- MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.030
- IT WAS HIS CAT!
[all groan]

08:50.063 --> 08:52.365
- YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED
FOR ANYTHING.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.570
- YES, ALL RIGHT.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.906
- MOMS ALWAYS SAID,
"IT'S ONLY A MISTAKE, PAPI,

08:58.939 --> 09:00.107
IF YOU DON'T LEARN FROM IT."

09:00.140 --> 09:01.675
AND I TELL YOU, PARTNER,

09:01.709 --> 09:03.543
I WILL NEVER,
EVER FORGET MY GUN AGAIN,

09:03.577 --> 09:06.279
BECAUSE I JUST HAD, LIKE,
A VERY VALUABLE EXPERIENCE,

09:06.313 --> 09:10.417
WHICH IS, LIKE, AWESOME
AND UNFORGETTABLE.

09:10.450 --> 09:13.186
AND NOW I'M READY
TO ROCK AND ROLL, KID!

09:13.220 --> 09:15.522
- [chuckles]

09:15.555 --> 09:17.658
RADIO.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.301
- WHICH BRINGS US BACK
TO OUR TYPICAL DAY.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.970
MOUSSE?
I CALL HIM "MOUSSE"

09:30.003 --> 09:31.639
'CAUSE HE PUTS MOUSSE
IN HIS HAIR.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.040
- IT'S A HAIR NUTRIENT.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.975
- MM-HMM.
- OH.

09:35.008 --> 09:39.212
- WELL, IT WAS A DAY
LIKE ANY OTHER DAY.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.949
WHO ATE ALL THE DOUGHNUTS?

09:41.982 --> 09:46.286
THERE WERE 12 GOURMET
BAVARIAN CREAMS IN THERE.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.655
- I HAD ONE.
- I HAD ONE.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.889
- ONE.
- I HAD ONE.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.423
AND IT WAS
EXTREMELY DELICIOUS,

09:50.457 --> 09:52.626
LIKE PUDDING INSIDE A PILLOW
MADE OF SUGAR.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.094
THANK YOU SO MUCH, JOHNNY.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.129
- YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME.
THAT'S FOUR.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.898
THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S EIGHT
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.600
$36, PEOPLE.
THAT'S HOW MUCH I SPENT.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.902
$3 A DOUGHNUT.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.603
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S INSANE.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.838
- DID YOU HAVE ONE?

10:04.872 --> 10:06.173
- YES, BUT HAD I KNOWN
THE COST,

10:06.206 --> 10:09.977
I WOULD HAVE EATEN IT
MUCH, MUCH SLOWER.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.512
- THAT'S SEVEN
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.182
- WHY WOULD YOU SPEND $40
ON DOUGHNUTS?

10:15.215 --> 10:18.686
- BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE LIKE
A FAMILY TO ME!

10:18.719 --> 10:22.255
SO I SPLURGED ON THE DOUGHNUTS
SO THAT EVERY MEMBER

10:22.289 --> 10:24.792
OF MY FAMILY COULD HAVE
A FANCY-PANTS DOUGHNUT.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.626
AND EVERYONE GOT ONE, RIGHT?
RIGHT? RIGHT? RIGHT?

10:26.660 --> 10:27.995
EXCEPT ME.
I DIDN'T GET ONE.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.797
SO THAT MEANS SOMEBODY--
I DON'T KNOW WHO--

10:29.830 --> 10:30.998
DOUBLE-DIPPED.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.532
- IF YOU WANTED
A DOUGHNUT SO BAD,

10:32.565 --> 10:33.533
WHY DIDN'T YOU HAVE IT
IN YOUR TRUCK

10:33.566 --> 10:35.002
ON THE WAY OVER HERE?

10:35.035 --> 10:37.037
- BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE NICE

10:37.070 --> 10:38.806
TO EAT IT
WITH MY WORK FAMILY,

10:38.839 --> 10:42.175
WITH THE PEOPLE
THAT I LOVE AND CARE FOR.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.945
I WANTED TO ENJOY
MY GOURMET DOUGHNUT

10:44.978 --> 10:47.681
WITH MY WORK BROTHERS
AND SISTERS.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.382
- I HAD ONE.
THANKS, JOHNNY.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.885
- YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.954
WHO'S THAT?
- JEREMY, DISPATCH.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.490
- YOU KNOW, YOUR WORK BROTHER.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.059
- DO YOU THINK
THAT HE HAD TWO?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.327
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
KIND OF GUILTY TO ME.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.394
- HEY, GHANDI, YOU'RE UP.
- HEY.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.396
- CARDIAC ARREST
IN WRIGLEYVILLE.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.466
- THIS ISN'T OVER.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.736

11:15.575 --> 11:17.244

A LITTLE VARIETY.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.813
OLD LADY ON THE SOUTH SIDE
SMELLED BURNT TOAST,

11:19.847 --> 11:22.750
THOUGHT
SHE WAS HAVING A STROKE.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.851
PHANTOM SMELLS--

11:23.884 --> 11:27.320
VERY COMMON SIGN OF STROKE.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.756
- BURNING TOAST--

11:28.789 --> 11:31.391
A VERY COMMON SIGN
OF BEING AN OLD LADY.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.094
AND THAT'S ROUGHLY
OVER HALF THE JOB.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.996
- PIZZA DELIVERY GUYS
WITH BLOOD PRESSURE CUFFS.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.031
- WE PICK YOU UP,
HAUL ASS TO THE HOSPITAL,

11:38.065 --> 11:39.733
AND DROP YOU OFF

11:39.767 --> 11:42.402

11:44.071 --> 11:45.538
AFTER THIS MORNING,

11:45.572 --> 11:48.508

UH, NUMBER TWO...
BAVARIAN CREAM.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.550

NUMBER FOUR, FIVE, AND SIX,
BAVARIAN GODDAMN CREAM.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.854
- OKAY, YOU'RE VENTING.
NOW, DO YOU WANT TO VENT,

12:00.888 --> 12:02.589
OR DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A SERIOUS
DISCOURSE ON DOUGHNUTS?

12:02.622 --> 12:04.124
- WE CAN'T DO BOTH?
- OKAY.

12:04.157 --> 12:07.027
I'LL GO FIRST.

12:07.060 --> 12:11.231
CHOCOLATE FROSTED,
SUGAR GLAZED, JELLY.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.867

12:13.901 --> 12:15.435
OH, BAVARIAN CREAM ISN'T EVEN

12:15.468 --> 12:17.704

12:17.737 --> 12:19.406
- BUT YOU HAD ONE THIS MORNING,
RIGHT, GOO OR NO GOO?

12:19.439 --> 12:22.142
- THEY WERE
THE ONLY DOUGHNUTS THERE.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.877
- DID YOU HAVE TWO DOUGHNUTS?
- I HAD ONE.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.378
- SOMEBODY HAD TWO.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.214

GODDAMN DOUGHNUT.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.483

I WOULD HAVE HAD TWO.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.952
OH.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.553
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WANT
TO DO SOME MORE VENTING.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.955

12:34.988 --> 12:36.256
- TOP THREE DOUGHNUTS
ALL TIME--GO.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.092
- I'M NOT REALLY
A DOUGHNUT ENTHUSIAST.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.293
- AND YET YOU HAD ONE
THIS MORNING AS WELL.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.895
- ACTUALLY,
I ONLY ATE HALF OF IT.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.997
IT'S TOO FILLING.

12:44.031 --> 12:47.968
- THERE'S NO "I"
IN "CREAM," JOHN.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.436
- IS THERE AN "I"
IN "SHUT UP"?

12:49.469 --> 12:51.972
- NO.
- NO.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.875
- GOOD DAY, BAD DAY,
WE'RE STUCK WITH EACH OTHER.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.647
- WHAT'S GOT YOU SO THOUGHTFUL?
- I HAVE AN ITCH.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.682
I'M TRYING TO DECIDE
IF I SHOULD SCRATCH IT.

13:02.715 --> 13:06.253
- LET US KNOW
WHERE YOU END UP ON THAT.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.021
- IT'S A FEMININE ITCH.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.623
- I DON'T NEED TO KNOW THIS.
- YOU ASKED.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.593
- TECHNICALLY, HE DIDN'T ASK.
I VOLUNTEERED THE INFORMATION.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.495
- STATS, THERE'S NO REASON
TO SUFFER.

13:15.528 --> 13:19.632
WE GOT A WHOLE RIG
FULL OF OINTMENTS BACK THERE.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.034
- WAIT A MINUTE.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.602
IS SHE GONNA BE APPLYING
OINTMENTS RIGHT NOW?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.637
- SHE SAID SHE HAD
A FEMININE ITCH.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.140
- I KNOW WHAT SHE SAID.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.509
- IF YOU HAD A MAN ITCH
THAT REQUIRED AN OINTMENT

13:29.542 --> 13:31.011
AND THE OINTMENT WAS RIGHT HERE
IN THE RIG,

13:31.044 --> 13:32.312
WOULD YOU WAIT
BEFORE APPLYING IT?

13:32.345 --> 13:33.480
- HEY, STATS--

13:33.513 --> 13:35.382

AND IN THE END, IT WAS A DAY
FULL OF LAUGHTER AND HEARTACHES

18:09.122 --> 18:12.692
AND MIND-MELTING STRESS
AND PRESSURE.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.597
THAT DAY WAS A BITCH.

18:17.630 --> 18:22.569

18:35.982 --> 18:38.485
WE WERE ALL SO TIRED.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.353
IT WAS MY IDEA.
