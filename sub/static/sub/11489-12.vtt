00:03.400 --> 00:05.290
oh,excuse me.

00:05.290 --> 00:07.510
Gesundheit.

00:09.020 --> 00:10.230
sorry.

00:10.230 --> 00:12.920
I hope I'm not coming
down with something.

00:19.360 --> 00:20.880
You think you might be?

00:20.880 --> 00:25.760
Well,I've been feeling a little congested
and I think it's settling in my chest.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.650
That's certainly where
I was planning to settle.

00:28.650 --> 00:29.500
Maybe I should go home.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.930
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.659
Let's not overreact.

00:32.659 --> 00:35.240
We can still do this.We
just have to be careful.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.790
What do you mean?

00:36.790 --> 00:38.820
Well,we can keep kissing,but,you know,

00:38.820 --> 00:41.710
amish-style with the
tongues parked in the barn.

00:42.630 --> 00:45.460
If you need to cough or
sneeze,just tap me on the shoulder

00:45.460 --> 00:49.610
and I'll cover your
face with a pillo and...

00:52.280 --> 00:53.430
you can use this.

00:53.430 --> 00:56.570
Nasal spray.Thank
you.That's so thoughtful.

00:56.570 --> 00:59.830
Well,you are gonna need to
breathe through your nose.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.360
want to see a movie today?

01:10.360 --> 01:11.220
With you?

01:11.220 --> 01:12.170
Yeah,with me.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.150
No,thanks.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.040
Okay.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.430
Want to do something else?

01:18.430 --> 01:19.330
Like what?

01:19.330 --> 01:21.190
I don't know.Anything.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.960
Well,can we go to les girls,girls,girls?

01:26.730 --> 01:27.540
What?

01:27.540 --> 01:29.970
That place near the
airport.Looks real interesting.

01:29.970 --> 01:31.850
I think it's french.

01:33.030 --> 01:37.210
No,no,we're not going
to les girls,girls,girls.

01:37.590 --> 01:40.330
Then don't say we can do "anything."

01:40.330 --> 01:42.050
Okay,forget it.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.220
You really want to do something with me?

01:45.220 --> 01:46.260
Yes.

01:46.260 --> 01:49.170
How about  youou dvevee to the mall
so I can see a movie with my friends,

01:49.170 --> 01:51.760
and then you pick me up when we're done?

01:51.760 --> 01:53.980
And what am I supposed
to do all that time?

01:53.980 --> 01:57.640
Well,if I were you,I'd go
to les girls,girls,girls.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.640
who's going to les girls,girls,girls?

02:03.360 --> 02:04.520
Nobody.

02:04.520 --> 02:05.640
Too bad.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.950
Date time's better

02:07.950 --> 02:11.660
Dancers are a little worse
for wear,but they try harder.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.670
oh,god.

02:15.670 --> 02:19.350
I should've sent that woman home as
soon as I saw the first snot bubble.

02:19.970 --> 02:21.730
I'm done.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.950
Me,too.Get dressed.I'll
drive you to the mall.

02:24.950 --> 02:26.210
Cool.

02:26.210 --> 02:28.250
Will you make me soup before you go?

02:28.250 --> 02:29.380
I don't have time,charlie.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.950
But I'm sick.Who's
going to take care of me?

02:31.950 --> 02:33.190
What do you want me to say?

02:33.190 --> 02:36.630
Maybe if you bothered to develop a human
relationship that involved more than

02:36.630 --> 02:41.250
the thoughtless exchange of bodily
fluids,you'd have someone to take care of you.

02:43.080 --> 02:47.110
You know,the whole time you were
talking,you could've opened a can of soup!

morning.

02:58.990 --> 03:00.510
Hey,berta.

03:02.910 --> 03:04.500
what's wrong with you?

03:04.500 --> 03:06.190
I caught something.

03:06.190 --> 03:08.170
There's a surprise.

03:08.790 --> 03:10.710
Yeah,it's really bad.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.110
Throat,sinuses,stomach,aches,chills...

03:16.110 --> 03:19.770
I swear to god,I feel
like I'm gonna die.

03:19.770 --> 03:21.340
Huh.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.810
Okay.

03:25.430 --> 03:28.680
Well,good luck.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.040
this it is

03:53.090 --> 03:55.610
I'm a goner.

04:00.350 --> 04:02.310
Hello?

04:02.700 --> 04:04.680
Anybody here?

04:05.790 --> 04:09.280
Anybody gonna take care
of good old charlie?

04:11.240 --> 04:13.100
Okay,then.

04:13.730 --> 04:16.910
Time to scrape the bottom of the barrel.

04:19.890 --> 04:22.460
Mommy,I don't feel good.

04:22.460 --> 04:27.140
Oh,charles,don't tell me you've got
another case of the bangkok drippy-drip.

04:27.140 --> 04:29.060
No offense.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.210
No-no,no,it's a cold or a flu.

04:32.210 --> 04:34.580
And this concerns me how?

04:34.580 --> 04:40.580
I thought maybe you could come over and make
me soup or put a cool,wet cloth on my head.

04:40.580 --> 04:41.990
Oh,oh,darling,

04:41.990 --> 04:44.330
I'd love to,but,um...

04:44.330 --> 04:47.910
unfortunately,mommy's sick,too.

04:51.420 --> 04:53.320
oh,right,that does sound bad.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.340
Oh,it is.

04:55.340 --> 05:00.650
I hate painting the hooves
of this white she-bitch.

05:01.630 --> 05:02.810
what was that?

05:02.810 --> 05:05.130
Just my delirious fever babble.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.920
Bye,dear.

05:08.060 --> 05:09.340
All right.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.590
I'm on my own.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.900
Maybe a little fresh air and sunshine.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.040
And nighttime cold medicine.

05:27.050 --> 05:32.770
Fresh air,sunshine and
nighttime cold medicine.

05:35.310 --> 05:37.520
And scotch.

05:40.670 --> 05:47.260
Fresh air,sunshine,nighttime
cold medicine,and scotch.

06:05.900 --> 06:09.990
okay,just nighttime
cold medicine and scotch.

06:22.150 --> 06:24.250
Hi,charlie.

06:27.950 --> 06:29.560
Rose?

06:29.560 --> 06:31.410
I thought you were in england.

06:31.410 --> 06:33.690
I was asked to leave.

06:34.290 --> 06:37.460
A little misunderstanding
at buckingham palace.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.650
So how are you?

06:39.650 --> 06:40.760
Not so good.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.090
I'm sick.

06:42.090 --> 06:43.740
Oh...

06:45.380 --> 06:47.900
poor baby.

06:47.900 --> 06:50.280
Isn't anybody taking care of you?

06:50.280 --> 06:52.380
No,I'm all alone.

06:52.380 --> 06:55.490
Well,that's just not
right.I'll take care of you.

06:55.490 --> 06:56.280
You will?

06:56.280 --> 06:59.780
Of course.Do you want
me to make you some soup?

06:59.780 --> 07:01.180
I would love soup.

07:01.180 --> 07:02.800
I asked everybody to make me soup.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.780
You'd think I was asking for a kidney.

07:06.850 --> 07:08.140
What are you doing?

07:08.140 --> 07:11.700
Nighttime cold medicine and scotch.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.320
I call it "the drunken hulk."

07:16.180 --> 07:17.220
No,sweetie.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.660
I have something better.

07:18.660 --> 07:20.450
I doubt it.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.520
Well,this is new.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.920
Just approved in europe.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.460
Ooh,europe,give me.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.040
That's my little man.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.390
Now,I'll go make you that soup.

07:33.390 --> 07:35.510
Thank you.

07:38.410 --> 07:41.790
Okay,europe,let's see what you've got.

07:42.870 --> 07:47.990
That was a great pill.What was
in that pill?It's a great pill.

07:48.310 --> 07:50.400
Don't you worry about that.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.700
You just get your rest.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.540
You know what else is great?

07:54.540 --> 07:57.670
You showed up exactly
when I needed you the most.

07:57.670 --> 08:00.080
It's like you're my guardian angel.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.890
Hey,you think I can get
another one of those pills?

08:03.250 --> 08:06.100
No,sweetie,one's enough for now.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.720
Just go to sleep.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.120
Okay.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.980
Good night.

08:11.420 --> 08:14.670
Good night,charlie.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.429
Can you hear me?

08:39.429 --> 08:41.409
Uh-huh.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.360
Listen closely to my voice.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.050
You're very,very sick.

08:47.050 --> 08:49.770
I'm very,very sick.

08:49.770 --> 08:54.070
But don't worry: Rose is
going to take care of you.

08:54.070 --> 08:56.990
Rose is going to take care of me.

08:56.990 --> 08:59.700
Till death do us part.

09:02.970 --> 09:05.780
I'm going to need another pill.

09:08.610 --> 09:11.610
You know,it wouldn't kill you to thank me
for dropping you off and picking you up.

09:11.610 --> 09:14.260
Thank you for dropping
me off and picking me up.

09:14.260 --> 09:15.440
Jake,jake,wait.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.800
What?

09:17.650 --> 09:18.380
okay,listen,I,

09:18.380 --> 09:22.900
I know you're getting to that age where you'd
rather be with your friends than with your old man,

09:22.900 --> 09:24.110
and it's okay.

09:24.110 --> 09:29.050
It's completely normal for you to want to
take your first steps to manhood on your own.

09:29.050 --> 09:30.340
I applaud that.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.910
But,I just hope that...

09:32.910 --> 09:39.230
while you're on this path,that every now and then
you make an effort to carve out a little dad time.

09:46.840 --> 09:49.450
well,that was humiliating.

09:52.070 --> 09:53.500
Charlie?

09:53.850 --> 09:56.060
How are you feeling?

09:58.560 --> 09:59.950
Rose?

09:59.950 --> 10:01.710
Hi,alan.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.640
What are you doing here?

10:03.640 --> 10:05.520
Taking care of charlie.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.700
I'm very,very sick.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.550
Go for it.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.700
So,how long are you back in town?

10:19.700 --> 10:21.600
As long as charlie needs me.

10:21.600 --> 10:25.070
Well,don't you let that big baby
take advantage of your good nature.

10:25.070 --> 10:26.230
Don't worry,berta.

10:26.230 --> 10:27.970
I'm fine taking care of him.

10:27.970 --> 10:30.690
Well,that's good,'cause
nobody else wants to.

10:31.500 --> 10:35.830
The truth is,I just love feeding
him,cleaning him,changing him.

10:35.830 --> 10:36.830
You're changing him?

10:36.830 --> 10:38.000
You're cleaning him?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.860
You know,if you stop feeding
him,you won't have to change him.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.570
I don't mind.

10:43.570 --> 10:45.440
I'm a loving nurturer.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.890
Uncle charlie says yorere arazy stalker.

10:49.710 --> 10:51.910
Potato,potahto.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.990
Hey,rose,you want to
go see a movie later?

10:54.990 --> 10:55.970
Maybe.

10:55.970 --> 10:57.800
We'll see how your uncle's feeling.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.860
He's very,very sick.

11:03.300 --> 11:06.180
So,basically,what we're saying here is,

11:06.180 --> 11:09.110
you'll go to the movies
with anybody but me.

11:09.110 --> 11:11.250
Not anybody.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.910
I wouldn't go with hitler.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.150
Charlie?

11:20.150 --> 11:21.910
I'm in here!

11:22.200 --> 11:24.420
What are you doing out of bed?

11:24.420 --> 11:26.450
What do you think?

11:26.450 --> 11:29.100
let me help you.

11:31.010 --> 11:32.700
Rose,I got this.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.550
Just relax,sweetie.

11:34.550 --> 11:37.500
I said I got it.Let go.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.160
But you're sick.You
shouldn't be lifting anything.

11:42.270 --> 11:43.990
All right,I'm done.

11:43.990 --> 11:45.420
Need a shake?

11:45.820 --> 11:47.110
No,thanks.

11:47.110 --> 11:48.700
Okeydoke.

11:49.120 --> 11:52.480
Now let's get you back into be

11:52.480 --> 11:53.880
rose...

11:54.240 --> 11:57.970
I appreciate you taking care of
me,but I'm thinking the worst is over.

11:57.970 --> 12:00.190
That's your mind playing tricks on you.

12:00.190 --> 12:03.990
If you start running around too
soon,you'll relapse,maybe get pneumonia.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.040
Pneumonia?

12:05.040 --> 12:07.180
Your lungs fill up with
fluid,you can't breathe,

12:07.180 --> 12:09.810
and you end up drowning
in your own mucus.

12:10.170 --> 12:11.810
You don't want that,do you?

12:11.810 --> 12:14.520
I don't want to drown
in anybody's mucus.

12:16.380 --> 12:18.390
Of course you don'T.

12:18.390 --> 12:20.270
Open.

12:21.230 --> 12:23.180
Good boy.

12:26.110 --> 12:29.130
I am really lucky to have you,rose.

12:29.130 --> 12:31.280
You know what,charlie?

12:31.540 --> 12:33.950
I think we make our own luck.

12:33.950 --> 12:35.290
We do?

12:35.290 --> 12:37.120
Well...

12:37.560 --> 12:39.740
I do.

13:40.630 --> 13:42.570
rose?

13:43.860 --> 13:45.550
Hello?

13:46.050 --> 13:48.820
Anybody there?

13:57.470 --> 14:00.070
What the hell!

14:06.550 --> 14:08.860
Oh,that's not right.

14:09.690 --> 14:10.970
Alan?

14:10.970 --> 14:12.300
Alan?

14:12.300 --> 14:14.840
Alan!

14:20.350 --> 14:22.140
What's the matter?

14:22.140 --> 14:24.850
How long have I been up here?

14:24.850 --> 14:26.330
I don't know.About two weeks.

14:26.330 --> 14:29.340
T-two...two weeks?

14:29.750 --> 14:31.630
Didn't you think to check on me?

14:31.630 --> 14:36.150
Well,frankly,everything was going so
smoothly around here,it never occurred to me.

14:37.830 --> 14:39.520
Are those knit booties?

14:39.520 --> 14:41.210
What?

14:41.210 --> 14:42.480
I don't know.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.710
Since when do you wear knit booties?

14:44.710 --> 14:48.330
Since when do I have
turquoise fingernails?

14:48.330 --> 14:49.540
Where's rose?

14:49.540 --> 14:51.160
She went to the movies with jake.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.510
God forbid my son should go
anywhere with his own father.

14:53.510 --> 14:55.940
- I mean,I have tried everything...
- alan,listen to me!

14:57.510 --> 14:59.710
You cannot let rose back in this house.

14:59.710 --> 15:00.480
Why not?

15:00.480 --> 15:03.530
Because thcoldld pls she's been
giving me are not cold pills.

15:03.530 --> 15:05.320
- What do you think they are?
- I don't know.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.590
Probably something you give to
elephants when they can't sleep.

15:09.410 --> 15:10.860
Elephants?

15:10.860 --> 15:13.340
European elephants.

15:14.020 --> 15:15.980
You know,I..I think
miyou ght be delirious..

15:15.980 --> 15:17.000
You really should lie down.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.530
Screw that.

15:18.530 --> 15:20.660
I'm gettin' out of here
before she comes back.

15:20.660 --> 15:22.920
Are those comfy?'Cause
they look really comfy.

15:23.530 --> 15:25.200
Charlie?

15:25.200 --> 15:27.280
What are you doing up?

15:27.280 --> 15:29.070
Stay away from me,rose.

15:29.070 --> 15:30.250
What's wrong,honey?

15:30.250 --> 15:31.520
Don't you call me "honey."

15:31.520 --> 15:33.270
Charlie,charlie,you need to calm down.

15:33.270 --> 15:34.940
C-calm down?

15:34.940 --> 15:37.790
Thanks to her,I've been a
drooling vegetable for two weeks!

15:37.790 --> 15:38.570
I was afraid of this.

15:38.570 --> 15:41.510
He's running a very high
fever,and he's hallucinating.

15:41.510 --> 15:42.820
I am not running a fever.

15:42.820 --> 15:45.420
Here,feel me.I am not hot.

15:45.420 --> 15:48.200
A little clammy and none
too fresh,but not hot.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.470
Just relax,babyYou need your rest.

15:50.470 --> 15:53.280
No,no,no.What I need is a lawyer.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.960
Alan,please,you got to
believe me: I am not sick.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.810
I beevlie you.Now lay down.

16:00.810 --> 16:02.060
But,alan...

16:02.060 --> 16:04.640

16:09.830 --> 16:10.790
Okay.

16:10.790 --> 16:13.560
Okay,you're right.I-I'm-I'm
crazy from the fever.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.360
Not crazy,honey.

16:15.360 --> 16:18.760
Just very,very sick.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.400
Open up.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.310
Good boy.Swallow.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.200
there you go.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.670
Now get some rest.

16:31.250 --> 16:35.180
so,does a guy have to be sick
to get a pair of those booties?

16:46.490 --> 16:50.250
Thank god she wasn't
using suppositories.

17:12.670 --> 17:15.079
son of a bitch!

17:15.079 --> 17:17.790
Charlie,are you up?

17:55.120 --> 17:56.950
- Alan!
- Whoa!

18:00.360 --> 18:01.320
What are you doing?

18:01.320 --> 18:03.010
Escaping.

18:03.420 --> 18:05.100
Well,charlie,this isn't a good time.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.720
I've already had my
second cup of coffee.

18:08.310 --> 18:09.640
Look,I don't know how long I've got.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.640
Neither do I.

18:14.410 --> 18:16.820
oh,damn it.She's out.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.550
Out of what?

18:18.550 --> 18:20.690
Her freakin' mind!

18:20.690 --> 18:23.180
Charlie,where are you?!

18:23.180 --> 18:25.530
Oh,god,she's coming.Is your door locked?

18:25.530 --> 18:27.220
No.Neither was my window.

18:27.220 --> 18:29.630
Two mistakes I will never make again.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.930
Charlie,are you in here?

18:32.930 --> 18:33.740
Rose!

18:33.740 --> 18:35.740
Sorry,alan.Have you seen charlie?

18:35.740 --> 18:37.900
Bathtub.

18:42.150 --> 18:44.910
For god's sake,alan,you're my brother.

18:46.480 --> 18:50.460
Oh,charlie,is this how you act
after everything I've done for you?

18:50.460 --> 18:52.290
Yes,this is how I act.

18:52.290 --> 18:54.920
Playing anne frank in a bathtub.

18:55.350 --> 18:56.180
Well,I give up.

18:56.180 --> 18:58.520
I can't take care of you
if you won't cooperate.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.010
Oh,no,no,rose.Let's,uh...

19:00.010 --> 19:01.060
let's not be hasty.

19:01.060 --> 19:03.690
It's been so nice these
last couple of weeks.

19:03.690 --> 19:05.560
What if charlie promises
to behave himself?

19:05.560 --> 19:08.910
I am not promising nurse
ratched here anything!

19:09.270 --> 19:11.420
Well,then,I guess I'll just leave.

19:12.970 --> 19:14.610
- You're not leaving.
- I was bluffing.

19:14.610 --> 19:16.560
- Rose.
- Sorry.

19:19.550 --> 19:21.320
Well,I hope you are proud of yourself.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.800
All she was trying to do was help you.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.010
No,no,no,that's not what
she was trying to do.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.510
This was all a plot.

19:29.510 --> 19:31.250
It started with getting me sick.

19:31.250 --> 19:34.980
Then she drugged me to keep me helpless so
she could move in and have her way with me.

19:34.980 --> 19:37.270
Oh,really?Yse gotroou sick?

19:37.270 --> 19:41.780
It had nothing to do with you sticking your
tongue down the throat of a flu-riddled bimbo?

19:41.780 --> 19:44.400
Okay,I'm not saying I know 
how she did it,but she did it.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.150
Charlie,do you have any idea
how insane this makes you sound?

19:47.150 --> 19:49.780
I have proof.Come on.I'll show you.

19:49.780 --> 19:52.660
Uh,charlie?

19:54.440 --> 19:56.880
Fine,I'll wait outside.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.860
I'm bored.Want to go see a movie?

20:04.860 --> 20:05.830
Now?

20:05.830 --> 20:07.620
Well,you got the listings there.

20:07.620 --> 20:09.480
Jake,for the love of god...

20:09.480 --> 20:12.670
fine,but don't say I never asked.

20:15.790 --> 20:17.950
You'll see.I have proof.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.050
I didn't swallow the last pill she
gave me so we can have it analyzed.

20:21.050 --> 20:24.510
Right.We'll call csi  and
have them run some tests.

20:26.980 --> 20:29.740
I hid it under my pillow,and...

20:34.730 --> 20:35.830
okay.

20:35.830 --> 20:38.480
I don't have proof.

20:46.530 --> 20:47.910
Rose?

20:47.910 --> 20:49.910
Oh,hi,lulu.

20:49.910 --> 20:51.460
How'd your plan work out?

20:51.460 --> 20:55.240
Well,you were fine,but I
think I may have overplayed it.

20:55.240 --> 20:58.820
Well,if you want to take another swing
at him,I think I'm coming down with mono.

20:58.820 --> 21:01.050
Oh.Charlie's already had mono.

21:01.340 --> 21:03.810
Give me a call if you get
mumps or whooping cough.

21:03.810 --> 21:05.920
Will do.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.700
Oh,rose.

21:29.900 --> 21:33.470
Oh,god,not another one.
