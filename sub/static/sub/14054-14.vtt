00:02.440 --> 00:04.317
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- What? You're driving.

00:04.480 --> 00:06.118
Yeah, because you're drunk.

00:07.320 --> 00:10.949
- Stop, okay? You're scaring me.
- Good. You're scaring me. 

00:11.120 --> 00:12.314
I called the therapist.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.959
- Mom.
- She's right, kiddo.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.315
Therapy was part of the deal
of you moving in.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.277
I know you. You go to Harbor, right?

00:18.440 --> 00:19.839
- Marissa Cooper.
- What's wrong with you?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.150
Your sister,
do you ever hear from her?

00:22.320 --> 00:24.151
The number I have
is no longer in service.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.072
I like you. So does she.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.557
- Lf we don't put an end to this soon...
- Someone's gonna get hurt.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.751
So maybe next time
we go see a movie...

00:36.920 --> 00:39.229
...it won't be a three-hour
period piece about boats.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.152
They call them ships. And I liked it.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.153
I don't know. Russell Crowe,
he just doesn't do anything for me.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.595
I mean, people say
he's good-Iooking...

00:46.760 --> 00:48.512
...but I don't see it.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.557
- I never really thought about it.
- Hey.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.790
Only one more day left in 2003.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.030
It's been a good year.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.673
Yes. My parents got divorced,
my dad went bankrupt...

01:00.440 --> 01:02.237
...and I OD'd.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.355
I meant...

01:04.519 --> 01:05.635
...for me.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.912
I know. I can't wait to celebrate
the new year...

01:10.080 --> 01:11.672
...with you.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.630
So, what do you wanna do?
I heard of some parties...

01:15.800 --> 01:19.236
Maybe we should take it easy
after what happened at Christmas.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.674
What happened at Christmas?

01:21.320 --> 01:24.039
It's all kind of a blur, actually.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.355
Kidding.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.672
Funny.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.273
I thought we could hang here.

01:31.440 --> 01:35.877
You know, maybe rent a couple
Russell Crowe movies.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.157
Stay in...

01:40.520 --> 01:42.158
...so I know you'll be safe.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.471
I love you.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.428
I mean...

02:07.600 --> 02:09.318
l... I didn't mean... I...

02:11.120 --> 02:12.314
Thank you.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.511
You're welcome.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.469
Midnight. Curfew.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.279
I love you.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.429
I love you.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.238
How hard is that to say?

02:52.800 --> 02:53.949
Saying it's easy.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.113
Meaning it?

02:56.400 --> 02:58.118
That's the hard part.

02:59.640 --> 03:03.474
- Who the hell are you?
- It's a long story. Who the hell are you?

03:03.640 --> 03:06.108
It doesn't work that way, dude.
It's my pool house.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.191
Actually, dude, it's my pool house.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.793
So this is yours.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.879
You want it back?

03:12.040 --> 03:14.190
I got plenty, thanks.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.317
You're Kirsten's sister Hailey, right?

03:17.480 --> 03:20.836
So you've heard of me. I guess
Kirsten remembers I actually do exist.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.275
- She didn't say you were coming.
- She doesn't know.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.352
Look, we'll get it all
sorted out over breakfast.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.795
The living room couch
is pretty comfortable.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.559
And...

03:34.760 --> 03:35.795
...Iove you too.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.433
Hey.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.670
What happened to you?
Lady kick you to the curb?

04:26.840 --> 04:29.638
The pool house was occupied.
Your aunt.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.836
- Hailey's here? Awesome.
- Yeah, she's...

04:32.000 --> 04:35.197
Nine across, seven-letter word for...

04:35.360 --> 04:38.158
Separate seats, you guys.
There's no sex in the champagne room.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.709
- Good morning to you too.
- Morning. Where's Hailey?

04:40.880 --> 04:45.510
- I don't know. Thailand. Morocco.
- I think she's planting trees in Tacoma.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.398
Costa Rica, building churches.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.716
I think it was Nicaragua,
and they were hospitals.

04:49.880 --> 04:53.156
- She's in the pool house.
- What are you talking about?

04:53.360 --> 04:55.920
Did you not notice Ryan
sleeping on the couch?

04:56.080 --> 04:57.877
Your sister's here.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.871
Wait, wait. You saw her...

05:00.040 --> 05:03.749
...you were talking to her, or...?
Did she say why she was here?

05:03.920 --> 05:06.798
I have two guesses.
Either she's run out of money...

05:06.960 --> 05:08.313
...or she's run out of money.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.391
Three-letter word for hilarious?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.039
"Dad." Write that down.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.714
- She is probably out of money, though.
- Hailey's here.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.673
Hey, guys. Guess who's back.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.193
Hello, Hailey.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.920
Aunt Hailey.
Later, when you're dressed, we'll hug.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.152
Seth. Robe. Her. Now.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.951
There you are.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.838
- Happy New Year, everyone.
- Happy New Year.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.553
Hi.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.271
We would have come
and picked you up...

05:36.440 --> 05:39.352
...at the airport or the train station.
- Or the border.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.159
Yeah, well, it was late,
and my cell phone got shut off.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.799
When you ran out of money?

05:43.960 --> 05:47.396
So you're gonna stay with us.
For some time?

05:50.080 --> 05:54.278
I'm gonna make up the guest bedroom.
Bedding, sheets, now.

05:55.440 --> 05:59.433
Married 17 years, the first things that go
are the full sentences. Welcome back.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.079
Thanks.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.357
Looking good, nephew Seth.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.078
Thank you. Puberty happened.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.834
- It's been that long?
- It sure has. Be glad you missed it.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.718
Check this out though.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.315
Chest hair. And a new friend.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.357
Yeah, that's Ryan. He's...

06:18.520 --> 06:19.999
He's kind of a long story.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.753
So now that you're a man,
what are the New Year's Eve plans?

06:24.080 --> 06:25.229
Got any girls to kiss?

06:25.400 --> 06:27.789
I had two. And now I have none.
But it's cool.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.349
- Because I swore off women.
- Right.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.557
I took myself off the market.
I'll do whatever Ryan and Marissa do.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.358
Marissa. The short chick next door?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.670
No. Puberty happened. She's a Laker.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.751
Sounds like Ryan and Marissa
won't do much...

06:39.920 --> 06:42.957
...because of three little words
Ryan couldn't say.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.633
- Where's the Frosted Flakes?
- That's four.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.916
"I love you."

06:47.080 --> 06:49.355
Shut up.
Ryan, Marissa said that to you?

06:50.960 --> 06:53.713
- Okay, what did you say?
- "Thank you."

06:56.000 --> 06:58.434
Well, guess we'll be
staying in tonight.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.591
Carson Daly and a ball dropping.

07:01.040 --> 07:05.079
There's two images that should
never be said in the same sentence.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.439
Nice of the doctors to keep
the offices open today...

07:15.600 --> 07:18.592
...with all our resolutions to analyze
before they're broken.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.359
Yeah, it was nice of them.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.239
So, what are they?

07:23.400 --> 07:26.153
Your resolutions
that you're never gonna keep.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.469
Give me one. At least one.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.312
I'm gonna eat more vegetables.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.552
Wow. You and the doc
really went deep.

07:32.720 --> 07:36.838
- What about dairy? Grains?
- Actually, we feel good about the grains.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.673
And tonight, New Year's Eve,
you're a social chair.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.717
I'm sure you've organized
several events.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.792
- Ferris wheels, balloon animals?
- Done that.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.916
So, what's the deal?

07:47.320 --> 07:48.833
You ask a lot of questions.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.115
One of us has to.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.349
What are you doing?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.476
Well, now that you've asked...

07:54.640 --> 07:56.915
I'm having a party at my place.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.592
You live in the Four Seasons?

08:02.240 --> 08:04.196
Come by and I'll explain everything.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.149
Yeah, maybe we will.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.198
"We," as in you and your friend?

08:09.360 --> 08:13.035
My boyfriend, Ryan.
He wants to stay in. He's not as social.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.191
My girlfriend's the same way. Natalie.

08:15.360 --> 08:18.397
But she'll be there.
I can meet him, you can meet her.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.313
- It's a party.
- Yeah. Hopefully I'll see you there.

08:21.480 --> 08:25.996
There'll be veggies. No painkillers.
But crudit Ás <i>,</i> some celery, dip.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.151
Well, as long as there's dip.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.510
Can we focus for a moment?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.557
On the fact that you've gotten matronly
in the last two years?

08:34.720 --> 08:36.278
Two years is what I want to focus on.

08:36.440 --> 08:41.070
What am I gonna wear tonight?
A little Ann Taylor, little Ralph Lauren.

08:41.679 --> 08:44.274
Oh, my God. Is this from Talbots?

08:44.440 --> 08:47.591
It was a gift. Haven't you been living
in hostels, out of a backpack...

08:47.760 --> 08:49.910
...wearing hemp clothes?
- That was last year, Kiki.

08:50.080 --> 08:54.392
Don't call me Kiki. Only Dad calls me Kiki.
And only because he won't not.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.196
- You do remember Dad, don't you?
- I have a vague recollection.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.237
Well, wait till he hears you're back.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.231
You know,
I was gonna tell him in due time.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.312
You have two weeks
before he gets back from Paris...

09:05.480 --> 09:06.708
...with Julie Cooper.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.438
Dad and Julie Cooper?

09:08.960 --> 09:11.155
At least he's dating somebody my age,
not yours.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.151
How does Jimmy Cooper feel about this?

09:13.320 --> 09:14.958
Pretty good...

09:15.120 --> 09:17.998
...now that they're getting a divorce.
- Things have picked up.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.798
You know, I should come back
more often.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.155
Hailey, what are your plans exactly?

09:22.320 --> 09:25.312
- Ladies. So I'm gonna go...
- Surfing? Fun. Where?

09:25.480 --> 09:28.677
- At the spot by the place.
- Four-footers. I heard that too.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.236
- Sunglasses?
- Yeah, I was just gonna ask you.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.038
Kitchen. So tonight?

09:33.200 --> 09:35.430
Yeah, what time should I make
the reservations?

09:35.600 --> 09:36.589
- Eight?
- Eight.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.990
- Perfect. Table?
- The usual.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.113
- I love you.
- You too.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.717
What?

09:44.880 --> 09:46.757
You guys are like...

09:46.920 --> 09:48.717
...married.
- Well, that was the idea.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.519
- When we had our wedding?
- No, I mean, like...

09:52.040 --> 09:54.679
...deeply, deeply married.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.390
Forget it.
Anyway, so tonight you guys...

09:58.560 --> 10:00.994
Are going to dinner at the Arches.
We do it every year.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.515
Home in time to watch Dick Clark
and the ball drop.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.955
Two images that shouldn't be used
in the same sentence.

10:06.120 --> 10:09.192
It's too bad you're busy tonight.
I know this really great party...

10:09.360 --> 10:11.510
...where you guys would have,
like, actual fun.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.148
But I understand. You're boring now.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.916
I am not boring.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.435
- Hey, baby, I can't find...
- Keys?

10:19.600 --> 10:22.194
- Check your...
- Pants. You're good.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.237
Gucci. Now we're talking.

10:24.400 --> 10:28.154
- And I will be wearing this.
- To the Arches? That's kind of fancy.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.757
Hey, Sandy, after our annual dinner,
how do you feel about a party?

10:31.920 --> 10:33.751
We're not going to a party.
We made plans.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.196
- To do nothing.
- Who's Oliver?

10:37.360 --> 10:39.669
A guy from therapy.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.957
Hey, there'll be crudit Ás. And dip.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.550
Sorry. I guess it's more
of an inside joke.

10:45.880 --> 10:48.394
Between you and Oliver?
You guys have inside jokes?

10:48.560 --> 10:50.551
It'll be fun. There'll be people.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.631
As opposed to here,
where it'll just be us.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.912
I thought you wanted to do nothing.

10:55.080 --> 10:59.995
- Yeah, well, that was before...
- Right. Before I...

11:02.120 --> 11:05.635
- What?
- Because I didn't say...

11:06.720 --> 11:09.553
- What?
- When you said...

11:10.000 --> 11:12.833
- What?
- Never mind.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.832
So are you going?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.150
I'm staying here, watching movies.
Like we agreed.

11:19.320 --> 11:22.471
- Okay. Well, if you change your mind...
- So you're going?

11:22.800 --> 11:24.916
Like I said. Yep.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.238
Happy New Year.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.271
Happy New Year.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.558
You know what you did?

11:37.720 --> 11:40.075
You know what you did?
You blew it, buddy.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.595
Almost as bad as I did.
But you know what?

11:42.760 --> 11:44.318
We're both single now,
it's a new year.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.789
We should join Friendster,
meet new people.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.190
We didn't break up.
It's just New Year's Eve.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.033
Only the most important chick holiday
besides Valentine's Day.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.988
- Why don't you just go to this party?
- Because we had plans, and...

11:57.040 --> 11:58.712
Because, I mean, who's Oliver?

11:59.440 --> 12:02.318
Okay. As long as you're clear
on your motivation.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.710
- Okay, we're gonna go.
- Do you guys need anything?

12:04.880 --> 12:06.836
Yes. Ryan needs a tear
in the space-time continuum...

12:07.000 --> 12:10.072
...so he can go back and say
"I love you" to Marissa.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.912
She said "I love you"?

12:13.800 --> 12:15.597
- So what did you say back?
- "Thank you."

12:15.760 --> 12:17.910
- Thank you.
- Well, that was polite.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.196
That's what I said.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.519
- You guys have fun.
- See you.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.875
- I love you guys.
- Thank you.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.069
- You guys look hot.
- Hey, don't sound so surprised.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.994
Let's go. Move it out. I don't want to see
you crazy kids back here before 2.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.672
Thanks for this.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.229
When we get back,
we'll talk about your plan...

12:40.400 --> 12:43.233
...and how long you're here. And why.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.348
You're okay about tonight?

12:45.520 --> 12:48.432
I'm just gonna catch up with
some friends. Don't worry about me.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.639
- You guys deserve to have some fun.
- I couldn't agree more. Let's go.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.597
- Happy New Year.
- Thanks.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.879
What are you guys doing here?
You're not even dressed.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.589
I know. I told you.
We're not going out. Carson Daly. Balls.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.797
- I thought you were being sarcastic.
- Usually a safe assumption.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.793
- Where's your lady friend?
- Out at a party.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.599
Your girlfriend's at
a New Year's Eve party alone?

13:12.760 --> 13:14.955
She's not alone.
She's with some guy named Oliver.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.350
- You've gotten really glib.
- You guys broke up.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.715
We're just not spending
New Year's Eve together.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.314
You know what they say,
the way you spend New Year's Eve...

13:22.480 --> 13:24.232
...is the way you'll spend
the rest of the year.

13:24.400 --> 13:28.075
So, at the countdown to midnight,
when she's looking for someone to kiss...

13:28.240 --> 13:30.435
...and you're playing video games
about pirates...

13:30.600 --> 13:35.754
- Ninjas.
...and it's like, 10, nine, eight...

13:35.920 --> 13:39.276
...and she's all alone,
when she sees this guy Oliver.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.432
Seven, six, five.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.194
Fireworks start, music swells.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.191
Four, three.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.272
People are pairing off.
Who's she gonna kiss?

13:50.880 --> 13:53.394
Two, one.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.118
- You guys look hot.
- Too hot?

13:55.280 --> 13:57.669
Because I'm trying to keep
a low profile these days.

13:57.840 --> 14:01.196
- Thanks for getting me out of the house.
- Hey, you're part of the family...

14:01.360 --> 14:04.477
...and we look out for our own.
Now, let's go. Come on.

14:04.640 --> 14:05.834
Out.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.797
- You wanna come?
- No.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.279
I'm gonna...

14:09.440 --> 14:10.839
...hang out.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.069
Take it easy, lay low.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.593
All right.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.832
Hailey Nichol!

14:23.680 --> 14:25.398
- Taking it easy?
- Laying low?

14:25.560 --> 14:27.391
Just a couple of friends.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.675
This is gonna be totally fun.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.593
We're at the penthouse
of the Four Seasons.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.830
I know. It's just...

14:46.000 --> 14:47.115
...you know?

14:47.280 --> 14:49.794
Coop, the way you spend
your New Year's Eve...

14:49.960 --> 14:52.997
...is the way you're gonna spend
the rest of the year.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.434
- It is?
- Yeah.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.477
And you're not gonna think of Ryan.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.631
And I am so not thinking
of Seth Cohen...

14:58.800 --> 15:01.155
...and how pathetic it is
that he's staying home...

15:01.320 --> 15:03.675
...probably playing, like,
a stupid video game about...

15:03.840 --> 15:07.515
...like, pirates or ninjas
or something.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.909
Oh, right. The Four Seasons.
Penthouse.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.710
It's undeniable.

15:16.320 --> 15:19.357
- Hey, people I know.
- Where?

15:19.520 --> 15:21.078
Hey, Anna. What are you doing here?

15:21.240 --> 15:24.277
My parents are friends of the parents
of the guy who's throwing this.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.873
- You know Oliver?
- Who?

15:26.040 --> 15:28.270
Hey, you made it.
Come on, I'll show you around.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.078
Okay.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.278
So where's Seth?

15:32.600 --> 15:35.160
I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

15:35.320 --> 15:37.709
I don't know, and I don't care.

15:37.880 --> 15:41.509
Me either.
Seth Cohen is, like, so 2003.

15:41.680 --> 15:46.037
And in, like, 74 minutes,
I'll never have to think about him again.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.953
- Seventy-three.
- Even better.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.552
Skinny-dipping!

15:53.320 --> 15:57.552
Oh, God, dudes.
Okay, that's a lot of genitalia in my pool.

15:57.720 --> 15:58.835
- We should go.
- We can't.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.991
What about the Marissa-Oliver
countdown thing?

16:01.160 --> 16:02.752
That was before
I took a faceful of Dom.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.718
I can't leave Hailey.
The place will get trashed. She's insane.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.996
- You said she was awesome.
- Insanely awesome.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.948
- So tell her. Party's over.
- Right. Except I don't want to be the dad.

16:12.120 --> 16:15.351
Listen, telling my aunt she can't have
a party is embarrassing. You do it.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.990
- It's your house.
- Right. And it's your girlfriend with Oliver.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.798
I'm helping track your motivation.

16:20.960 --> 16:24.509
- She's part of your family.
- Cohens are known for conflict avoidance.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.194
But Atwoods, they thrive on it.
You're the man for this.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.157
- I'm not gonna win this argument.
- No.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.833
Right.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.594
Hey, no ball dropping
till midnight, okay?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.116
Thanks. That's what
I was talking about.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.510
Wait for me.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.789
<i>In one quarter of a mile, turn left.</i>

16:46.960 --> 16:48.313
What's going on?

16:49.520 --> 16:51.033
Nothing.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.591
Are we in a rut?

16:57.600 --> 16:58.874
That's nothing?

16:59.040 --> 17:01.918
No, we're not in a rut.
We're in a marriage.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.229
It's just...

17:03.400 --> 17:06.198
We finish each other's sentences,
we know what the other's thinking.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.555
- That's my favorite part.
- I own a sweater from Talbots.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.709
That was a gift.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.195
Look, I don't think anybody
would think we're boring.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.156
But do we need to take more chances?

17:15.319 --> 17:17.390
<i>In 400 feet, turn left.</i>

17:18.920 --> 17:20.911
Yes, we do need to take
more chances.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.990
GPS lady says turn left...

17:26.040 --> 17:27.108
...I'm going right.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.229
Sandy, don't.

17:29.400 --> 17:33.552
No, you can't stop me. No one can.
Hang on. Here we go.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.830
<i>When possible, please make a U-turn.</i>

17:40.000 --> 17:42.514
No. No, I won't. I will not.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.871
Sandy, please.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.112
Baby, we're living on the edge, honey.
We're living on the edge.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.191
We're not living on the edge,
we're getting lost.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.316
Would you just listen
to the GPS lady?

17:52.480 --> 17:54.675
<i>When possible, please make a U-turn.</i>

17:54.840 --> 17:56.796
Thank God. Because you know I...

17:56.960 --> 18:00.555
I hate to defy the GPS lady,
because she gets so cross.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.919
- Do you think we're fun?
- Yeah, I do.

18:05.080 --> 18:09.312
Come on. Your sister is so
up inside your head, it's nuts.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.278
No one's as fun as Hailey.
I mean, that's her calling in life.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.317
She's 10 pounds of fun
in a 5-pound bag.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.630
- What does that mean?
- It means she's fun.

18:16.800 --> 18:20.998
You know, she's a Nichol. She's a pot
stirrer, a ball buster, a button pusher.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.958
- She is pushing your buttons.
- That she is.

18:24.120 --> 18:27.430
We're going to a party where we don't
know anyone. Anything could happen.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.034
- That's true.
- That's fun.

18:31.480 --> 18:35.029
Why don't we skip dinner
and just go to that party?

18:35.200 --> 18:37.953
<i>When possible, please make a U-turn.</i>

18:38.320 --> 18:39.912
You are dangerous.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.796
Hey, so this is a cool place
to have a party.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.554
Yeah? Well, my parents own
a bunch of them.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.234
- Hotel rooms?
- Hotels.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.279
I've never had these before.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.113
They are excellent.
Of course, these are virgins.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.272
They won't take the edge off,
they won't numb the pain.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.193
- But they're fun to say. Mojito.
- Mojito.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.920
- Mojito.
- Mojito.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.513
Hey, you know, just because I'm not
drinking doesn't mean you can't.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.389
Yes. But then my sponsor would be
so disappointed in me.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.598
Clean and sober 11 months.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.279
You did meet me in therapy.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.631
So where's Ryan?

19:26.040 --> 19:28.110
He's not here.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.117
I can see that.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.353
So when do I get to meet Natalie?

19:35.640 --> 19:38.996
Yeah. She's not here.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.791
- What happened?
- Long story.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.794
Long-distance relationship. You know,
those are always so fraught with peril.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.757
Anyway, she's a freshman at Arizona.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.150
- An older woman?
- Not really.

19:51.320 --> 19:55.359
She had the benefit of not getting
kicked out of three schools in three years.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.114
Makes it a whole lot easier
to graduate on time.

19:58.880 --> 20:02.759
But as for me,
now I'm doing senior year, again.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.993
And she's doing her freshman thing.
You know, having fun, partying.

20:07.160 --> 20:10.470
And I don't think she wants to be
in a serious relationship anymore.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.113
And you love her?

20:15.520 --> 20:18.353
- Have you told her?
- Of course. All the time.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.952
- To Ryan?
- To Natalie.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.988
- We can have fun without them, right?
- I hope so.

20:26.160 --> 20:29.436
Not the inspiring answer
I was looking for, but I'll take it.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.351
Look, I get it.
I get that you're upset, okay?

20:54.480 --> 20:56.550
- One minute.
- I need to talk to you.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.358
I said, one minute.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.556
- Just hear me out.
- I don't know why you're back.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.393
- You still owe me $3000.
- I know. I'll get it back to you.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.391
That's what you said two years ago.

21:05.560 --> 21:08.757
- What, did your trust fund run out?
- I was gonna ask you the same thing.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.390
So you're back to make a withdrawal from
your dad. Then you'll split again?

21:12.560 --> 21:14.869
I don't need this.
You're supposed to be my friend.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.838
You don't have any friends left.
You burned all those bridges.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.877
It doesn't look like it from tonight.

21:20.040 --> 21:23.112
Or everybody knows no one throws
a rager like Hailey Nichol.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.510
You're looking for some good blow,
clean speed...

21:25.680 --> 21:27.955
This conversation is over.
You want to go, then go.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.758
Not without my three grand.

21:29.920 --> 21:33.230
You better hope that Cameo doesn't
show up, after what you did to Alex.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.471
Goodbye.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.036
Hey. Do you think it's time
we end this?

21:38.200 --> 21:39.792
No, I don't.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.837
Well, maybe the cops will.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.309
So what? You're, like, a narc now?

21:47.160 --> 21:48.639
Fine.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.360
Let's just talk about this.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.512
This place isn't so rocking. I mean,
we're way more fun than these people.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.598
This is Hailey's big party?

22:08.760 --> 22:11.069
I just hope there's a deviled egg.
I'm starving.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.753
Kirsten.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.434
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you're here.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.239
I had no idea you were so much fun.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.716
Yeah. Hi, Taryn.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.757
- You know my husband, Sandy.
- Hi.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.037
- Well, if I don't now, I might at midnight.
- Hello.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.511
Go ahead, Sandy.
Put your watch in the bowl.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.392
Whoever ends up with him
is gonna be one lucky lady.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.352
- Oh, my God.
- I think we're at a swingers party.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.954
I'm gonna kill Hailey.
We can still make dinner, can't we?

22:42.120 --> 22:46.671
- Oh, yeah. We're leaving.
- We can't stay here, can we?

22:46.840 --> 22:49.229
We're not in this big a rut.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.790
- You think we're in a rut. You just said it.
- Where is that deviled egg?

22:52.960 --> 22:55.269
I mean, we don't have
the nerve to stick this out.

22:55.440 --> 22:59.479
- No, we don't. So let's go.
- We couldn't possibly stay, could we?

22:59.640 --> 23:01.073
Hey, we can stay.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.914
- I dare you.
- Don't dare me unless you mean it.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.798
- I dare you. Double dare.
- Okay.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.679
- Go ahead.
- You got three seconds to stop me. <i>Uno.</i>

23:14.840 --> 23:16.717
<i>Dos.</i>

23:20.920 --> 23:22.512
<i>Tres.</i>

23:39.040 --> 23:42.874
- We'll be chlorinating for weeks.
- Let's just go somewhere private to talk.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.076
Without getting the cops involved.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.549
I know your mom's gonna kill me...

23:47.720 --> 23:51.030
...and I'm really sorry...

23:51.200 --> 23:53.156
...but it's New Year's Eve.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.719
And we're having a party.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.591
Hey!

24:07.880 --> 24:10.189
Great. This is just great.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.600
- Oh, God. This isn't good.
- You think?

24:15.160 --> 24:16.878
- I can't breathe.
- What?

24:17.040 --> 24:19.076
- I'm claustrophobic.
- Seth, this place is huge.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.152
- It has a kitchen and a bathroom.
- Don't use up all the oxygen.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.756
- Want a sandwich? A shower?
- We're gonna die, and I'm the glib one?

24:25.920 --> 24:28.070
I sleep here.
Three of the walls are windows.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.879
Yes, looking out on naked dudes.
We're trapped like rats.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.270
Rats in a pool house!
By the way, your aunt's cool.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.396
Yeah, I know.
She's a little unpredictable.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.150
My shirt's strangling me.

24:38.920 --> 24:44.199
Great. My girlfriend's kissing some guy,
and I'm stuck here with a lunatic.

24:54.040 --> 24:58.716
I know. The first one of these
can be a little challenging.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.677
The key? Drink a lot.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.434
I'm just easing into it.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.158
It's worth it.

25:05.320 --> 25:09.438
New Year's Eve 1998,
this party saved my marriage.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.239
My marriage doesn't need saving.
We're not in trouble.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.597
Sure. Not trouble. Just a rut.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.955
I know. I was there.

25:18.120 --> 25:19.269
We're not in a rut.

25:19.440 --> 25:22.512
So many of us just sleepwalk
through our own lives.

25:22.680 --> 25:26.275
We don't even know we're asleep
till somebody wakes us up.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.953
I'm up.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.680
Take a chance.
What's the worst that could happen?

25:30.840 --> 25:33.559
One evening of crazy sex
with a total stranger.

25:33.720 --> 25:36.280
In college, that was a Thursday night.

25:36.440 --> 25:38.078
For you, maybe.

25:41.480 --> 25:46.190
You ask me, your husband's having a lot
of fun for someone who's not in a rut.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.552
Here's to you.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.990
Feel like drinking?

25:56.720 --> 25:58.597
No. Not really. You?

25:58.760 --> 26:00.512
No.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.110
I'm sorry.
He was probably smiling at you.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.158
No, your eye lines totally matched.
You should go.

26:15.560 --> 26:18.711
No. No, no.
He's clearly interested in you.

26:18.880 --> 26:19.995
You think?

26:23.560 --> 26:24.834
That was all you.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.152
No. Too close to call. We're not
ringing in '04 the same way we spent '03.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.471
- I'm on the case. Come on.
- No, you can't just go up to him.

26:32.640 --> 26:36.679
Hi. We were wondering,
who were you smiling at? Me or her?

26:37.400 --> 26:39.470
- You're both cute.
- No, not happening. Okay?

26:39.640 --> 26:42.359
One or the other.
You have to choose between us.

26:43.040 --> 26:45.110
Someone has to choose between us.

26:47.560 --> 26:49.790
You know what, Summer? It's okay.
You can have him.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.679
Anna, look. Seth Cohen
just wants to be our friend.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.512
I don't know anything about this guy...

26:54.680 --> 26:57.990
- Hi. I'm Allan, from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
- Yeah, don't care.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.435
All I know is, this guy doesn't
want to just be my friend.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.750
He's really not my type. Go for it.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.319
What's your type? Seth Cohen?

27:09.400 --> 27:11.356
I'm through.

27:12.520 --> 27:13.919
Right.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.355
And we have crudit Ás...

27:17.640 --> 27:19.437
...as promised.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.272
So now I have to eat them?

27:21.440 --> 27:23.351
Not until midnight.

27:23.520 --> 27:27.832
So, question. When you asked me
if I ever told Natalie I loved her...

27:28.000 --> 27:30.560
...it struck me as
an interesting question. Revealing.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.790
- You should be a therapist.
- So, what...

27:32.960 --> 27:35.633
...you said it to him,
and he didn't say it back?

27:36.040 --> 27:37.439
He said:

27:37.600 --> 27:38.999
"Thank you."

27:40.520 --> 27:42.476
At least he's polite.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.069
I'm getting another mojito.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.071
- You want one?
- Yeah.

27:47.120 --> 27:50.237
Maybe I just overreacted, you know?

27:50.400 --> 27:53.790
I mean, maybe he didn't say it
because he just wasn't ready.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.030
Yeah, or because, you know.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.952
Because he doesn't love me.

27:58.120 --> 28:00.156
Oh, hey, no. No.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.788
What do I know?
I don't even know the guy.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.551
Don't listen to me.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.388
I traveled to see
the Alaskan blue heron.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.120
I had no idea that
that involved so much travel.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.316
An ornithologist. That's fascinating.

28:17.480 --> 28:20.677
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Hey, I'm ready to go.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.558
Was this fun or what?

28:22.720 --> 28:25.029
Sandy Cohen.
Pleasure swinging with you.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.555
We're leaving?
I'm just starting to have fun.

28:27.720 --> 28:31.156
Did you know Bob studies birds?

28:31.320 --> 28:33.550
Birds? Bob, that's great.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.757
Listen, if we hurry,
I think we can still get our table.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.592
I wanna stay.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.718
- Bye, Bob.
- Maybe I'll see you later.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.071
- What are you doing?
- I'm having fun.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.390
What, discussing the pigeon with Bob?

28:48.960 --> 28:50.951
Hailey has so gotten under your skin.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.873
- No. This is not about Hailey.
- Oh, no?

28:54.040 --> 28:56.713
No. Maybe we needed to do this.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.632
Maybe we need to do
something dangerous.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.236
Maybe we are in a rut,
and we didn't even know it.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.551
- So you want to swing?
- I'm swinging.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.912
Heidi.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.958
You have got to finish telling me
about the Galapagos Islands.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.519
What a wild place.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.790
Forty-five minutes to midnight.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.797
If I ever get out of here,
your aunt is dead.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.668
- Hey, Ryan.
- Yeah?

29:26.040 --> 29:29.157
I have to ask you.
Why didn't you just say it?

29:29.600 --> 29:31.113
I don't know.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.758
Because I never have.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.594
But you do, right?

29:38.040 --> 29:40.315
I guess. I don't know.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.031
How do you know?

29:43.200 --> 29:45.589
I just think you know. I don't know.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.796
Yeah, I do.

29:52.960 --> 29:56.635
Why didn't you choose? I mean, you had
to like one more than the other, right?

30:01.760 --> 30:03.910
But now I don't deserve either,
because I blew it.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.752
Me too.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.478
I'm optimistic about this
Friendster thing, though.

30:09.640 --> 30:10.959
Forty-three minutes.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.388
- Hi.
- Hailey...

30:18.560 --> 30:21.677
...mad good party once again.
- Thanks for coming.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.159
Happy New Year.

30:24.800 --> 30:28.475
Where is that bitch? I can't believe
she'd even show her face in Newport.

30:28.640 --> 30:30.358
Cami, I don't know, okay?

30:44.840 --> 30:47.479
- I need help.
- Fresh oxygen.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.240
So you locked us in,
and now you want our help?

30:50.960 --> 30:52.791
- Pretty much, yes.
- No. I'm leaving.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.269
Wait, there's a girl out there
that wants to kill me.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.509
Just one?

30:56.680 --> 30:59.638
There's a girl who will kill me
if I don't get there in 39 minutes.

30:59.800 --> 31:02.598
- Okay, but please help me shut this down.
- I'm not helping you.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.194
Fine. Then she's gonna tear
this house apart.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.118
Do it for Sandy and Kirsten.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.237
Let's go. We gotta clear this party out.

31:11.400 --> 31:12.992
It's what I do best.

31:18.280 --> 31:21.078
- Good night.
- Thanks for coming.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.718
What did you do?

31:24.880 --> 31:27.997
- We shut off the power.
- Told them the cops were coming.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.477
- I gotta go.
- Go ahead. I'll clean up.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.993
- You sure?
- Yes. Go.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.071
Thirty-one minutes.
I hope I can make it.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.468
Me too.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.231
Come on, everybody. It's 11:30.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.879
We need to make our selection...

31:51.040 --> 31:54.669
...so we have someone new to ring
in the new year with.

31:57.760 --> 32:02.470
Since this is Evelyn's house,
we'll let her pick first. Evie?

32:08.960 --> 32:10.791
Way to go, Bob.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.115
Okay.

32:47.520 --> 32:50.398
I hope you have some better luck.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.356
I don't get it.

33:14.520 --> 33:18.229
Everyone else got picked.
What happened to my watch?

33:18.520 --> 33:20.636
It better be in your pants.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.557
Come on, swinger.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.039
Let's go home.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.835
<i>Traffic is looking pretty bad</i>
<i>on the 73.</i>

33:36.000 --> 33:40.437
<i>New Year's Eve is always ugly</i>
<i>on the road. Luckily it's almost over.</i>

34:03.160 --> 34:05.958
Hey. I'm gonna take off.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.110
You are? So close to midnight?

34:08.280 --> 34:11.795
Yeah, yeah. I don't wanna be here.
It's too depressing.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.070
- Happy New Year.
- Thanks.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.908
Hey. How you doing?

34:22.080 --> 34:26.197
I know it sounds stupid, but I keep
looking back at the door thinking...

34:26.360 --> 34:28.998
...maybe he'll show up...

34:29.560 --> 34:30.549
...in time.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.554
Yeah. I keep hoping to see Natalie.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.512
Sadly, I think it's just us tonight.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.356
But, hey, at least we have each other.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.960
- I think we're in the wrong house.
- I don't.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.029
What the hell happened?

34:58.200 --> 35:00.555
I don't know enough people
to cause this much damage.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.836
So how was the party?

35:03.200 --> 35:05.555
- What did you do?
- Nothing that can't be undone.

35:05.720 --> 35:08.837
A little Palmolive, some elbow grease.
Seth and I have it covered.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.592
Nobody mentioned elbow grease.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.069
Seth. Garbage. Out. Now.

35:15.720 --> 35:19.076
I look forward to waking up
to a clean house tomorrow.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.513
Good night, Sandy.

35:23.080 --> 35:24.559
I'm gonna get back to the dishes.

35:24.720 --> 35:26.472
You don't walk away from me.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.677
You're not Mom.
You can't talk to me that way.

35:29.840 --> 35:33.276
This is my house,
my upside-down couch!

35:33.440 --> 35:36.193
I will talk to you any way that I want.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.151
I should really learn to knock...

35:46.240 --> 35:49.516
...in case there's a threesome
going on in my bedroom.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.796
You can't keep living your life like this,
like you have no responsibility.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.279
Like you're still a child.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.715
What used to be cute
is now embarrassing.

35:58.880 --> 36:01.519
I'm sorry. The party got
a little out of hand.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.511
People your age,
they have finished college...

36:03.680 --> 36:05.716
...they have jobs, they're married.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.713
Look. In the morning I'll take off.

36:08.880 --> 36:12.077
I am not asking you to leave.
I just want you to grow up!

36:20.440 --> 36:23.432
It's a new year.
You can make a new start.

36:24.240 --> 36:27.277
Why? So I can grow up
to be just like you?

36:27.440 --> 36:29.510
Working for Dad,
selling McMansions...

36:29.680 --> 36:31.557
...planning charity events
with the Newpsies?

36:31.720 --> 36:34.188
Hey. I love my life...

36:34.360 --> 36:36.555
...my family, my rut.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.710
You spend so much time...

36:40.880 --> 36:45.192
...putting energy into having fun,
your whole life is dedicated to having fun.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.391
Are you even having any?

36:51.840 --> 36:54.673
- I'll help you clean up.
- I don't want your help.

36:56.760 --> 36:59.957
I'll finish in the morning.
I'm going to bed.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.558
Anna? Hey.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.755
I didn't want you to be alone
on New Year's.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.992
Actually...

37:17.240 --> 37:18.958
I didn't want to be alone
on New Year's.

37:20.080 --> 37:21.832
Well, I'm not alone.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.511
I have Captain Oats
and Carson Daly, so...

37:24.680 --> 37:28.468
Oh, wow. That's an unbeatable
combination. I'll go.

37:28.640 --> 37:32.235
Wait. Captain Oats
had too much champagne...

37:32.400 --> 37:35.472
...and Carson Daly's
kind of a ginormous tool.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.393
So I could use the company.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.279
Twenty seconds.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.799
Ten. Nine. Eight.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.679
Seven. Six. Five.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.357
You're not Seth Cohen.

40:05.520 --> 40:07.351
Who's Seth Cohen?

40:08.120 --> 40:10.475
I wasn't... I wasn't talking to you.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.477
I gotta go.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.551
Happy New Year.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.914
- I love you.
- What?

40:25.920 --> 40:27.273
I love you.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.358
Thank you.
