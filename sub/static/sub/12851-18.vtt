00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:07.274 --> 00:09.975
The holidays are
the best time to be a Riley.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.777
There's sleigh bells
and cocoa,

00:11.779 --> 00:14.179
and it's time once again
for Secret Santa.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.348
Yow!

00:16.350 --> 00:19.184
Every time you say
Secret Santa from here
until the end of Christmas,

00:19.186 --> 00:20.786
I will be doing
the small pinch.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.188
The small pinch?
The one where you take
the tiniest amount of skin

00:23.190 --> 00:25.157
between your nails
and do the small pinch?

00:25.159 --> 00:26.792
-Every time you say--
-Secret Santa?

00:26.794 --> 00:28.327
Yow!

00:28.329 --> 00:29.995
But why?

00:29.997 --> 00:32.364
Because let me tell you
a secret everyone's
been keeping from you.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.866
-What?
-We hate Secret Santa.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.501
You hate Secret Santa?

00:35.503 --> 00:37.036
Yow!

00:37.038 --> 00:39.571
Impossible!
Secret Santa-- Yow!

00:39.573 --> 00:43.375
...gives us all a chance
to dig deep and think
about someone else.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.578
Good. Let's think about
what I got you this year.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.247
(gasps) Maya!

00:50.384 --> 00:52.885
A suitcase?
Where are we going?

00:52.887 --> 00:54.319
-Somewhere?
-Nowhere!

00:54.321 --> 00:56.221
I'm your present!
I'm with you for the holidays!

00:56.223 --> 00:59.324
Yes! What? Yes!

01:05.332 --> 01:08.233
-Why?
-So we can have
an epic Christmas together.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.769
But you always start at home
and then end up here.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.272
But, Maya,
this is your first Christmas
with your mom and Shawn.

01:13.274 --> 01:16.108
-This one's going
to be different.
-But what if it's not?

01:16.110 --> 01:19.678
But if I'm not there
and something goes wrong,
can it be my fault?

01:19.680 --> 01:21.680
-No.
-This Christmas
we'll set the stage

01:21.682 --> 01:23.382
for what Christmas
is going to be like.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.350
My mom and I only know
how to do crazy,
but if I'm not there

01:25.352 --> 01:28.454
and Shawn doesn't see the crazy,
then maybe we have a chance.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.960
Why can't it ever just be
the best time to be a Riley?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.863
Ha!

02:44.865 --> 02:46.498
Do you never give up with this?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.433
Secret Santa's horrible
every year.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.002
You know who's
the smartest man alive?

02:50.004 --> 02:51.036
Thank you, Zay.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.539
I wasn't gonna say you.
I was gonna say Lucas.

02:53.541 --> 02:56.508
Why is Lucas smart?
He's not even here. Oh!

02:56.510 --> 02:58.544
Yeah, where is Lucas?

02:58.546 --> 03:00.279
He went to Texas
for the holidays.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.314
How could he have gone
without telling me?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.483
Because this was his way
out of Secret Santa.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.952
He knows even you can't reach
him 2,000 miles away.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.453
Oh, trust me, he's doin' it.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.722
Now, I want you to really
think hard about the person

03:10.724 --> 03:12.457
that you get,
because this gift

03:12.459 --> 03:14.059
tells them how much
that you know about them.

03:14.061 --> 03:17.462
And whatever happens,
do not say who you have.

03:17.464 --> 03:20.532
That's the egret
part of Egret Ahh-Ahh. Ready?

03:23.704 --> 03:24.903
Yikes.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.839
-Yikes.
-I got Maya.

03:27.841 --> 03:28.874
Smackle!

03:28.876 --> 03:30.542
This is who I am!

03:30.544 --> 03:33.478
Okay, you go.
Do not react.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.481
Oh, please, Riley,
show me how.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.229
It's Farkle.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.964
Smackle!

03:54.735 --> 03:57.402
All right, Peaches,
do not say who you have.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.472
Never, Sweetie, I know
how much this means to you.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.377
-Tell us.
-Never.

04:05.379 --> 04:08.113
I won't even tell you
if it's a him or a her.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.016
Thank you, Maya.

04:13.454 --> 04:17.422
Okay, everybody.
Let's find out how well
we really know each other.

04:22.229 --> 04:26.265
"But in a last word to the wise
of these days, let it be said

04:26.267 --> 04:30.302
that of all who give gifts,
these two were the wisest."

04:30.304 --> 04:33.105
Let me get this straight.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.807
-There's nothing
to get straight.
-I told you not to read to her.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.744
<i>The Gift of the Magi</i>
is one of the most beautiful
stories ever told.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.213
They loved each other
so much.

04:41.215 --> 04:45.717
Why? Because she sold her hair
to buy a thingy for his watch,

04:45.719 --> 04:48.587
and he sold his watch
to buy a thingy for her hair?

04:48.589 --> 04:51.056
This is love to you?

04:51.058 --> 04:55.994
Combs. He bought her
beautiful combs
for her beautiful tresses.

04:55.996 --> 04:59.831
-Tresses?
-Not now, Pookie.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.635
Ava, the man sold
his favorite thing
in the world.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.671
What's your favorite thing
in the world?

05:05.673 --> 05:08.106
-You are.
-Who's a good boy?

05:08.108 --> 05:09.408
Me. Ruff!

05:09.410 --> 05:12.678
Better story,
and I didn't have
to buy him nothin'.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.014
Hey, Ursula.
He bought her a thing,
and she bought him a thing,

05:16.016 --> 05:19.618
and those things were useless
because they loved each other.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.353
Why is this a good story?

05:21.355 --> 05:23.822
It's good because
they knew each other
so well

05:23.824 --> 05:25.524
that they proved their love
to each other.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.259
That's it. Yes, that's it.

05:27.261 --> 05:30.929
Great. She turns herself
into a bald chick,

05:30.931 --> 05:32.864
and he don't even know
what time it is.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.833
The end.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.136
The story has holes, man.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.440
-Switch!
-Okay. Guys,
the cookies are done.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.674
Who wants to help me
decorate 'em?

05:42.676 --> 05:45.944
(cheering)

05:55.155 --> 05:57.522
What's up?

05:57.524 --> 06:00.459
I need help, man.
I... I picked Smackle.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.461
You're on your own.

06:02.463 --> 06:06.131
Hey! We're supposed
to be friends.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.566
I think that's
the whole point, Zay.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.634
Riley's whole idea here
is to see how well
we know each other.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.903
I don't know her that well,
and you do.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.840
Yeah. It'd be super easy
for me to get her something
I know she'd like,

06:14.842 --> 06:16.875
-like a theremin.
-What's that?

06:16.877 --> 06:19.244
It's this weird
musical instrument
they use in horror movies.

06:19.246 --> 06:22.881
It goes kind of like...
(warbling)

06:22.883 --> 06:23.949
Okay.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.219
You can buy one of those?

06:27.221 --> 06:29.087
Yeah, she'd love
one of those.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.389
Yeah, she would.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.257
But that's my idea.
It doesn't help you
that I know that.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.659
-You need to know that.
-But I don't know her
that well.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.261
Why not? She's our friend,
she's in our group.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.729
Yeah. This is horrible.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.233
Horrible. (warbling)

06:43.337 --> 06:45.370
-You're doing
the theremin.
-Yeah.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.738
-I love the theremin!
-I know.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.340
You know what
I'd really like one day?

06:48.342 --> 06:50.242
-A theremin?
-Yes!

06:50.244 --> 06:52.611
-Who knows me
better than you?
-Nobody.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.712
Especially not you.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.947
Yeah. Thanks for nothin'.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.119
So, who'd you get
for Secret Santa?

07:01.121 --> 07:03.922
-Zay.
-What are you
gonna get him?

07:03.924 --> 07:06.224
I have absolutely no idea.

07:06.226 --> 07:09.928
(warbling)

07:09.930 --> 07:13.198
Yeah. Yeah.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.042
Ava, how many cookies
have you had?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.378
A lot!

07:26.380 --> 07:28.146
A lot! A lot! A lot! A lot!
A lot! A lot! A lot!

07:29.583 --> 07:30.949
Look how fast I can run!

07:31.985 --> 07:33.118
(squawks)

07:34.421 --> 07:37.389
I am taking you home
right now, young lady.

07:37.391 --> 07:40.125
You are spending Christmas
with your new family
and that is that.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.893
-That isn't that.
-Why can't that be that?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.595
Because you can't make me
if I don't want to.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.798
(squawking)

07:46.800 --> 07:48.133
(squawks)

07:49.770 --> 07:51.837
Maya, the best place
you can possibly be

07:51.839 --> 07:53.305
is with your family
right now.

07:53.307 --> 07:56.141
No. This is not the time.
People go crazy at the holidays.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.809
Why would you say that?

07:57.811 --> 08:00.212
(babbling)

08:01.782 --> 08:05.817
Maya, you are the best present
you could ever give
to your parents.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.719
I'm freakin' out, man.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.690
This is your guys's
first Christmas together,

08:11.692 --> 08:13.659
and they want
to spend it with you.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.627
No. We finally
have something,
and I'm not ruining it.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.929
What could you have
if you're not even there?

08:22.870 --> 08:26.671
Attention, Matthews family
and Freako Morgenstern!

08:26.673 --> 08:28.507
(snoring)

08:30.177 --> 08:32.310
We need to teach Maya
the meaning of Christmas.

08:32.312 --> 08:35.013
Bah, Humbug. My mom and I
don't know how to do Christmas.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.216
We throw snowballs
at the skaters
in Rockefeller Center.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.851
That was you?

08:41.788 --> 08:45.690
I almost died!

08:45.692 --> 08:48.827
I spent every Christmas Eve
at the diner with my mom,
watching her work.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.462
Then we'd have a couple
of tuna melts.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.497
she'd do her Christmas crazy
and we'd call it a day.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.065
What's Christmas crazy?

08:54.067 --> 08:55.700
What could your mom
have possibly done

08:55.702 --> 08:57.736
that you would be afraid
to show Shawn?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.838
-Gimbo the Elf.
-Who?

08:59.840 --> 09:02.474
She told me that Santa
really loved us too,

09:02.476 --> 09:04.743
but he was too busy
with the people uptown,

09:04.745 --> 09:07.712
so we got Gimbo the Elf,
who she became.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.748
Well, did she come
down the chimney?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.583
We didn't have a chimney.

09:11.585 --> 09:14.519
Um, she came in through
the hole in the wall and said,

09:14.521 --> 09:18.256
"Ho ho ho, little Maya.
Have you been
a good little girl?"

09:18.258 --> 09:21.826
And I'd say, "Not especially,"
and then I'd ask her to stay
in the hole

09:21.828 --> 09:23.428
because at least
it kept the wind out.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.564
All:
Yikes.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.733
That was all great
when it was just my mom and me.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.904
But "Merry Christmas,
Shawn Hunter, welcome to us,"
I don't think so.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.908
Mom, Dad, we need to turn them
into the perfect family
for the holidays.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.011
We're gonna need
a Christmas miracle!

09:45.519 --> 09:47.752
You carry glitter
in your pocket.

09:47.754 --> 09:51.323
I used to carry
butterflies, but...

10:02.903 --> 10:06.972
Welcome. Welcome,
good, gentle people to...

10:06.974 --> 10:09.140
"A Christmas Maya."

10:09.142 --> 10:11.810
-Really?
-Yes! Because we want
to show you

10:11.812 --> 10:13.945
what went wrong
with your Christmas past,

10:13.947 --> 10:17.449
so that you can improve
your Christmas present.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.785
-Christmas present.
-No.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.989
Act one! Christmas past.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.558
Crazy Christmas.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.299
(Southern accent)
Baby girl, it's me!

10:34.301 --> 10:39.938
Baby girl, your mama is home
from the Nighthawk Diner

10:39.940 --> 10:44.476
where I spent all Christmas Eve
slingin' hash for tips

10:44.478 --> 10:49.948
so that I could give you
the Christmas you deserve!

10:49.950 --> 10:52.450
She's me!

10:52.452 --> 10:56.287
All this time
I wanted to be her
and she's me.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.790
Too soon.

10:58.792 --> 11:02.927
I'm Maya Penelope Hart,
and I'm a troubled kid.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.496
With a heart of gold!

11:04.498 --> 11:07.198
And I wore these things
for like, two years.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.102
Guess who
I ran into to today.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.105
-Anybody but Gimbo.
-Gimbo the Elf!

11:14.107 --> 11:16.908
-Yay!
-No yay!

11:18.111 --> 11:21.946
Well... hello, Maya!

11:23.450 --> 11:24.983
I bet you're wonderin'

11:24.985 --> 11:28.953
what I've got in this big bag
of practical gifts.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.855
Wet Wipes?

11:30.857 --> 11:34.959
I... I wish.
It's just regular napkins.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.795
But I could
spit on 'em for ya.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.897
You're the best, Gimbo.

11:40.967 --> 11:45.904
This year I may not have
anything in this bag
that you want,

11:45.906 --> 11:47.906
but I tried real hard
for there to be somethin'

11:47.908 --> 11:51.042
that you might need.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.811
What's this, Gimbo?

11:52.813 --> 11:56.915
It's a permit
that says that next year
you can go to school

11:56.917 --> 12:00.051
with your new
little friend.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.753
You mean Riley?

12:01.755 --> 12:03.855
Yeah!
Would you like that?

12:03.857 --> 12:08.693
Who knows?
Maybe you'll meet
other friends, too.

12:08.695 --> 12:11.162
Maybe... I guess.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.565
It's not a toy or anything.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.500
I know.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.439
I'm so sorry, Mom.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.942
I didn't realize how important
that gift was.

12:23.944 --> 12:27.112
That's okay.
You were just a little girl.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.914
You gave me
all my friends.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.185
And now... Act Two.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.920
Christmas Present.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.922
-Secret Santa.
-Do it.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.058
Aah!

12:40.060 --> 12:43.261
No, Spirit, please don't
make me go.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.969
-Boy, you love drama.
-I know I do.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.879
-Okay, who goes first?
-No! We're not going
one at a time,

13:00.881 --> 13:02.413
I want this over with
as quick as possible.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.849
I don't think everybody
feels that way, Maya.

13:10.557 --> 13:14.492
Oh-- Oh, boy.
Uh, it's a clock.

13:14.494 --> 13:17.128
It's broken.

13:17.130 --> 13:21.332
And the instruction manual
on how to fix it.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.003
Best Christmas ever.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.641
I must've opened the wrong one.

13:33.346 --> 13:37.115
<i>The Magical Gathering</i>
<i>of Dungeon Masters.</i>

13:37.117 --> 13:40.585
<i>Of Catan. For Nerds.</i>

13:42.522 --> 13:44.155
This can't be for me.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.990
It has your name on it.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.861
Oh, wow. Just... Hmm.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.164
Thank you.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.334
Boy. I may have
never done this
with you before,

13:56.336 --> 13:58.336
but even I know
you could at least pretend

13:58.338 --> 14:00.104
to deeply appreciate
whatever you get.

14:02.342 --> 14:07.078
<i>Etiquette: A Guide</i>
<i>to Manners and Proper Behavior</i>
<i>Among People.</i>

14:08.815 --> 14:11.015
I deeply appreciate it.

14:15.055 --> 14:19.190
Guys, that's a really
mean gift. Guys?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.893
Farkle, wait. I'm sure
there's a good reason
that somebody would--

14:21.895 --> 14:24.829
Yeah, is there a good reason
somebody would get me this?

14:24.831 --> 14:28.366
Farkle, you found out
that your ancestors are Jewish.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.802
So... I-- I don't know
who I am anymore,

14:30.804 --> 14:33.471
I shouldn't even
be celebrating Christmas?

14:33.473 --> 14:36.407
No. No, that's not it at all.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.042
Why are you pushing me?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.745
I'm not!
I didn't mean to.

14:43.149 --> 14:46.818
Great job. I mean,
another brilliant year,
Secret Santas.

14:46.820 --> 14:49.220
Yeah, I guess
we don't really
know each other at all.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.330
A broken clock?
That's what you think of me?

15:01.268 --> 15:04.235
Maya, we're not going anywhere
until we figure out

15:04.237 --> 15:06.337
why these horrible gifts
are great.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.107
There's nothing to figure out,
the whole thing's a disaster.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.409
What does this mean, Riley?
How is this great?

15:12.412 --> 15:16.214
Farkle, I got this for you
not to change you,

15:16.216 --> 15:19.117
but because it's a part
of where you came from.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.520
Ever since the day
after our culture week,

15:22.522 --> 15:25.089
when you found out
that you might
have a new ancestry,

15:25.091 --> 15:29.027
I started reading about it.
Because I love you.

15:29.029 --> 15:32.230
And I would always
want to know who you are.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.098
Whoever you are.

15:35.902 --> 15:40.138
Did you know that in Hebrew
everything goes from right
to left?

15:40.140 --> 15:43.374
All this time,
everything you've done,
you've always thought

15:43.376 --> 15:45.143
left to right.

15:45.145 --> 15:49.347
And now, you may need
to consider that there's
another way.

15:51.284 --> 15:55.920
And when I thought
about that, I thought
it would be good for you,

15:55.922 --> 15:58.323
because if you know both ways,

15:58.325 --> 16:02.160
well... then you have
an even greater understanding

16:02.162 --> 16:04.462
than you did before.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.497
Isn't that
what you've always wanted?

16:11.171 --> 16:15.840
Happy Hanukkah, Farkle.
Merry Christmas.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.976
Happy everything.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.111
Thanks, Riley, uh...

16:20.113 --> 16:22.981
You're right. I'm gonna
try to learn everything
I can about this.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.491
This was from me, Zay.

16:33.493 --> 16:37.195
<i>The Magical Gathering</i>
<i>of the Dungeon Masters.</i>

16:37.197 --> 16:39.864
<i>Of Catan.</i>
<i>For Nerds.</i>

16:41.468 --> 16:44.535
Why would you think
I'd want this? Isn't this
something you'd want?

16:44.537 --> 16:46.204
Is this what you think of me?

16:46.206 --> 16:48.339
No, we know how close you are
to Lucas, and...

16:48.341 --> 16:51.609
with him away for the holidays,
we didn't want you to feel
like you were alone.

16:51.611 --> 16:55.046
So Smackle and I wanted
to include you
in our world, too.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.315
Farkle told me
that he didn't know
what to get you,

16:57.317 --> 17:00.184
and it bothered us
that we didn't know you better.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.121
And we want to.
So he got you this game,

17:03.123 --> 17:05.890
that will help us
to get to know you.

17:05.892 --> 17:08.893
-How?
-Because it takes
17 years to play.

17:11.331 --> 17:14.966
Then we better get started.
Thank you.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.042
I'm the one who, uh,
got you this.

17:24.044 --> 17:27.245
I know
that there are some things
that are different about me.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.814
That's why you got me
an etiquette book?

17:31.351 --> 17:35.453
Well... if you open it,
you'll see there's some
writing in the margins.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.324
Yeah, you crossed out
a lot of stuff.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.326
And you wrote some
of your own stuff.

17:42.328 --> 17:45.530
Yeah, here, see, it says, uh,
"A young lady speaks
in a gentle tone,

17:45.532 --> 17:47.398
and never raises her voice."

17:48.435 --> 17:50.234
Your voice is my favorite thing
about you.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.370
That's why
I crossed all these things out.

17:52.371 --> 17:54.505
That's why I changed everything
to the funny things you do
that I like.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.774
Because I know
you're working on stuff,

17:56.776 --> 17:59.043
but I never want you
to forget who you are,

17:59.045 --> 18:01.045
and what makes you wonderful.

18:07.053 --> 18:11.122
I'm feeling things
because of you!

18:11.124 --> 18:13.257
You're welcome, Smackle.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.761
Can't wait
to hear this one.

18:18.298 --> 18:22.433
It's beautiful.
But it's broken.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.470
It was hard
to find a broken one.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.305
Ever since I've known you,

18:27.307 --> 18:29.373
you've never stopped
trying to put yourself
back together.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.976
I wanted to get you something
to let you know

18:31.978 --> 18:37.081
that you've done a great job,
and it's okay to work
on something else.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.450
But why a clock?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.953
You already know
that time fixes
a lot of things.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.856
I thought you might like
to return the favor.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.794
I'm not crying, you are.

18:52.565 --> 18:56.134
-You did good, guys.
-So did you, Riley.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.002
Yeah, Riley,
maybe we should
give this Secret Santa thing

18:58.004 --> 18:59.971
one more year.

18:59.973 --> 19:04.442
Hey, Maya...
you know the good thing
about having a nice clock?

19:04.444 --> 19:08.079
Once you fix it,
it will always point you
towards your...

19:08.081 --> 19:11.382
Christmas future.

19:15.688 --> 19:19.524
Ghost of the Future.
I fear you most of all.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.429
(warbling)

19:25.431 --> 19:27.231
Get me one!

19:35.041 --> 19:38.509
I'm Shawn. Hey!

19:38.511 --> 19:40.711
Close enough.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.380
I live in a trailer park.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.216
It's Christmas.
I never liked Christmas.

19:45.218 --> 19:48.452
I never knew who my real mother
was, and the few times

19:48.454 --> 19:49.854
my father was home
for the holidays,

19:49.856 --> 19:54.559
-well...
-Happy cheese log, boy!

19:55.728 --> 19:58.996
This time, I am gonna
stay forever.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.431
Well... gotta go!

20:03.136 --> 20:06.370
Maya, you think
your Christmases were crazy?

20:06.372 --> 20:09.473
No, I think what's crazy
is you're supposed to be
showing me the future.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.409
This is Shawn's past.

20:11.411 --> 20:15.246
That's right.
Because to get
to your best future,

20:15.248 --> 20:16.881
you needed to see that.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.650
You got a lesson
for me here, Matthews?

20:19.652 --> 20:21.219
Well, I think Shawn might.

20:22.689 --> 20:26.390
At least you had people
that cared to be there.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.992
That's all I ever wanted.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.660
Don't you want that, too?

20:31.197 --> 20:33.397
Maya, sometimes
people find each other

20:33.399 --> 20:35.933
because they're exactly
who they need.

20:35.935 --> 20:39.503
It's like that great story,
the<i> Gift of the Magi.</i>

20:39.505 --> 20:44.475
Where people sacrifice
for other people
because they love them.

20:49.082 --> 20:52.583
I'm going to kill you
right now on Christmas.

20:54.554 --> 20:59.523
Maya. Go.
Shawn's waiting for you guys.

20:59.525 --> 21:03.394
-Mom?
-Yeah, honey?

21:03.396 --> 21:04.929
Can we go home now?

21:04.931 --> 21:07.098
Yeah.

21:07.100 --> 21:11.269
Thank you
for every Christmas past.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.871
You always gave me
everything I needed.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.040
Well, so did you, Baby girl.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.409
It is still okay
that I call you that, right?

21:18.411 --> 21:21.979
And it's okay
that Shawn's a part
of our crazy now?

21:21.981 --> 21:24.315
For the rest
of our lives.

21:30.056 --> 21:32.723
Merry Christmas.
We have to go.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.825
'Cause we have someone
waiting for us.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.395
So we're going home.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.730
Isn't that wonderful?

21:39.732 --> 21:42.466
Merry Christmas, every one.

21:57.583 --> 22:01.252
The best time
to be a Riley.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.532
Hey, buddy.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.100
I know what you did, Riley.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.605
Because I understand
the story, too.

22:21.607 --> 22:23.674
What did I do?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.976
You gave Maya back
to her family.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.378
Even though it was hard for you,

22:27.380 --> 22:29.313
and you wanted
to keep her for yourself.

22:29.315 --> 22:32.616
You gave her the gift
that would make her truly happy.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.555
Don't tell her.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.190
I don't have to.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.291
She knows.
