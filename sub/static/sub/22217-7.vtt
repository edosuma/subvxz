I can't believe you threw my first one
away. It's a surprise for my aunt.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.866
That will appear on the Thanksgiving table
over my dead body.

13:47.701 --> 13:48.994
Miss Blaisdel?

13:50.496 --> 13:54.416
Can I help you? It's just the wine cellar
and storage down there.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.462
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.
I thought it led upstairs.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.798
Well, it can be confusing,
such a big house.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.550
I have the perfect solution.

14:02.633 --> 14:07.763
Mr. Jones here can escort you,
now that he's done making his ham pockets.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.516
[CHATTERING]

14:19.149 --> 14:21.694
Don't be stingy
with those mashed potatoes.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.739
If there's anything
that can unite rich and poor, it's carbs.

14:25.823 --> 14:29.118
- What on earth are you doing here?
- You don't think I know what you do?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.911
I pay attention sometimes.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.373
You think I'm too stuck up
to sling rehydrated potatoes?

14:34.456 --> 14:36.750
You've ostracized everyone else.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.670
Maybe I wanted to give back,
help out at a homeless shelter.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.631
- This is a church.
- It's the same thing.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.134
You know what? Fallon, please just go.

14:45.676 --> 14:50.097
Michael, stop talking to the beautiful
lady. We got more trays to bring out.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.682
Who do we have here?

14:51.765 --> 14:55.477
- Hi, I'm Fallon.
- Fallon Carrington? You work with Michael?

14:57.479 --> 15:00.107
- I do.
- I'm Luella Culhane.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.651
And this is my husband, James.
We're Michael's...

15:02.735 --> 15:06.113
Oh, you're Michael's parents.
Wow, what a pleasure to meet you.

15:06.196 --> 15:10.743
You too. We couldn't be prouder
of our boy, moving up so quickly.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.287
Don't go embarrassing him
in front of his colleague.

15:13.370 --> 15:16.081
He is the first vice president
in the family.

15:16.707 --> 15:17.541
Is he?

15:19.376 --> 15:20.878
That really is something.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.637
Okay. Well, thank you for your time.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.433
Sam, have you seen Claudia?

15:34.516 --> 15:37.269
I walked her up to her room.
What's going on?

15:37.353 --> 15:39.021
This pill thing is getting weirder.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.690
She seemed to think her nurse

15:41.774 --> 15:43.776
- is trying to take advantage of her.
- Awful.

15:43.859 --> 15:47.988
It would be, except I talked to her nurse.
She said Claudia fired her.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.824
- Thought she was stealing from her?
- That's what I thought.

15:50.908 --> 15:54.787
She said she caught Claudia
skipping her meds and taking benzos.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.623
When she said something,
Claudia told her not to come back.

15:57.706 --> 16:01.585
You never should've brought Claudia here.
Like my mom used to say...

16:01.669 --> 16:04.588
"You bring in a stray,
you're gonna get fleas."

16:05.130 --> 16:07.508
- Please just help me look for her.
- Okay.

16:08.425 --> 16:09.426
Pull.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.178
[GUNSHOT]

16:14.348 --> 16:16.350
Always worried
you were gonna make me shoot.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.228
Of course not.
The turkey hunt was last week.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.234
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- You know, this is just a gun.

16:25.317 --> 16:30.197
- Not good, not evil, just... a tool.
- Not a very peaceful tool.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.535
I respect your ideals, Steven.
I do. I just...

16:35.828 --> 16:38.372
I wish they didn't make us butt heads
all the time.

16:38.455 --> 16:42.084
- Everything's an issue with you.
- I appreciate our father-son bonding time.

16:42.668 --> 16:46.046
Football with the pros, skeet shooting.
Like a billionaire's biathlon.

16:46.588 --> 16:49.883
There's always fencing
if you wanna make it a triathlon. Pull.

16:53.929 --> 16:57.766
I gotta be honest. I feel like
you're only buddying up to me...

16:57.850 --> 17:01.895
You think since I'm mad at Fallon,
that I'm trying to replace her with you.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.439
- Well, I'm not.
- No. No.

17:03.897 --> 17:07.192
I think you're buttering me up
because you don't want me to look deeper

17:07.276 --> 17:09.319
into what you're doing
with the foundation money.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.487
Ah.

17:11.571 --> 17:16.160
I've seen the books. I know that donation
isn't going where you're saying it does.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.871
I want you to know I'm stopping it.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.000
[CLEARS THROAT]

17:25.961 --> 17:29.590
Would you agree that we occupy
a unique position in the world?

17:29.673 --> 17:31.633
Of course. But I don't see what...

17:31.717 --> 17:37.806
All our wealth and power gives us
the privilege of doing a lot of good.

17:37.890 --> 17:42.561
Could do more good if we weren't wasting
our money to finance police corruption.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.440
The world is way more complex
than it is black and white.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.401
For us to give back,
we first have to protect what we have.

17:49.485 --> 17:53.363
[LAUGHS] A convenient way
to ignore right and wrong.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.657
I've been in this game
a lot longer than you.

17:55.741 --> 17:59.369
You're gonna have to accept
the rules are different at this level.

18:08.837 --> 18:13.759
Well, I'm not sure what your son told you,
but Michael and I don't work together.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.971
We used to.
I left my dad's company to start my own.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.391
Michael was such a talented executive
that I tried to poach him

18:21.475 --> 18:23.519
but your son's got some strong morals.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.854
- Well, that's how we raised him.
- Yeah.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.315
I do miss being around him.

18:28.857 --> 18:32.528
- I wish things were different.
- That's very nice of you to say.

18:32.611 --> 18:36.698
So, Fallon, are you the mystery girl
that's coming to dinner tonight?

18:38.033 --> 18:40.369
Lu makes a mean sweet potato pie.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.164
Uh, no. You guys must be thinking
of Michael's girlfriend, Kori.

You'll love her.

- No, you scared me.

I've been looking for you.
Cristal needs to talk to you.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.034
- What are you doing here?
- I woke up with a headache.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.996
I went looking for aspirin.
I keep opening up the wrong doors.

19:24.079 --> 19:27.416
Aspirin's in the kitchen,
next to the mugs. I'll show you.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.002
Of course they have a gunroom.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.216
Did you get in here?

19:49.313 --> 19:51.523
That girl's come back four times
for straws.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.984
Should I buy her toys?
Her own dispenser?

19:54.067 --> 19:57.654
There's a straw shortage and she's
driving up stock prices. You don't know.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.449
No. You're right. You don't know people.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.328

Even after I got hurt, lost the money,

20:23.472 --> 20:27.267
they were determined that I'd be
something, made me promise I'd graduate.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.144
- Didn't you?
- Damn right I did.

20:30.812 --> 20:34.399
But it cost them.
A second mortgage on the house.

20:34.942 --> 20:39.196
Dad working two jobs late.
Went without a lot, so I could be someone.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.448
How am I supposed to tell them
they did that

20:41.531 --> 20:44.076
so their son could drive
some rich white guy around all day?

20:44.159 --> 20:46.328
So, you lied because you're ashamed?

20:46.411 --> 20:47.287
No.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.499
It's because I know they would be.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.421
Sorry they thought you were Kori.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.633
Well, now I know why
I never got an invite to meet the parents.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.385
I'm still glad it happened.

- Yes, yes, it is.

You know what else would be grown-up
of you? Just go home to your family.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.697
My dad told me to find a new family.

[CHUCKLES]

22:06.658 --> 22:10.454

1976 Château Lafite.

Doesn't mean much to me.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.917
It is so beautiful.

22:17.252 --> 22:19.004
Such a deep red.

Be careful.
That wine's older than you are.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.885
Yeah. Oh, my God!

I'm so sorry.

22:27.471 --> 22:30.724
Oh, not to worry.
There's a second bottle in the cellar.

22:31.099 --> 22:32.225
I'll clean this up.

I should offer you a job on my staff.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.695
- Have you seen him?
- No.

23:25.821 --> 23:29.741
Well, I asked him to find Claudia
a while ago. I tried calling him.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.701
Is everything all right?

23:31.785 --> 23:35.455
Claudia fired her nurse a week ago.
She lied to me about it.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.790
Why would she do that?

23:36.873 --> 23:39.876
I think Claudia is intentionally
taking the wrong pills.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.088
- Like Munchausen's?
- She's trying to hurt the baby?

23:43.213 --> 23:46.550
She said she didn't think she'd make
a good mother, that she was scared.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.344
You haven't said this to Claudia,
have you? I wouldn't.

23:49.427 --> 23:53.265
Let's keep a close eye on her
until she's under professional care.

- No. Thank you.

- A catapult.
- Wow.

24:32.137 --> 24:36.099
- Where'd you learn to make that?
- YouTube. I'm going to be an architect.

24:36.266 --> 24:39.561
That's the work of an engineer,
which is way cooler than an architect.

24:40.103 --> 24:42.439
- It's what I wanted to be.
- Are you one?

24:42.522 --> 24:44.524
- God, no.
- Because you're a girl?

24:44.608 --> 24:48.570
No. Because my dad told me
engineers always work for someone else.

24:49.738 --> 24:53.783
You can be anything you wanna be.
There are plenty of girl engineers.

Have you seen Sam?

25:19.809 --> 25:23.772
Thought he was with you.
You were together, talking about my pills?

25:25.232 --> 25:26.399
Thought you were napping.

25:26.483 --> 25:29.444
Did you figure it out,
what happened with the pills?

25:31.571 --> 25:34.824
Why don't we talk about that later?
It's almost time for dinner.

25:35.408 --> 25:37.202
You're a smart woman, Cristal.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.747
And, surely, you figured it out by now.

25:41.289 --> 25:44.542
I mean, really.
Who else could have done it?

25:46.836 --> 25:48.922
You shouldn't have brought me here.

- You're not sick, are you?
- [SCOFFS] Just sick of you.

But, no, I haven't needed those pills
in a long time.

Of course it is. I'm in the wine cellar.

- I can't let you out. I'm...

Did Claudia trap you, too?

27:02.329 --> 27:05.540

- She has a gun?

27:06.458 --> 27:09.294
- Sam, we need to get out of here.
- What am I supposed to do?

27:09.377 --> 27:11.671
Grab a pistol and shoot the lock off.

Don't stereotype me, Anders.
I'm not some kind of gangster.

at the head of the table, can't she?

28:04.599 --> 28:05.683
Of course.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.562
That seat is where my father sat
and carved the turkey every Thanksgiving

28:09.646 --> 28:10.814
where I've done the same.

28:10.897 --> 28:13.108
And what's Thanksgiving without tradition?

28:13.191 --> 28:16.444
Football and pumpkin pie
and sitting in my seat.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.321

You picked a fine day
to ride your feminist high horse.

you have to control every detail.

Oh, okay, idealist.
What's the clear right and wrong here?

28:29.833 --> 28:31.960
Clear I should've gone to dinner
with Fallon.

- Blake, sit down.

Easy now. What's going on?
We can talk about it.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.064
That's a great idea.

go around and say what we're grateful for?

No takers?

Why does the crazy lady have a gun?

She's not crazy.
She's been faking her brain injury.

Why fake such a miserable life?
Actually, that's a rhetorical question.

30:18.817 --> 30:22.070

You've been faking lots of things.

- I bet.

The night I found out he was cheating
on me. Didn't know the other woman.

All you knew is that one minute
your husband was cheating,

30:37.085 --> 30:39.796
the next, he wasn't going anywhere.
He had to take care of you.

30:39.879 --> 30:42.298

- You lied.

You pretended to be sick
so that he would stay.

Why keep faking it after Matthew's death?

30:55.979 --> 30:58.773
- It's the perfect alibi.
- What are you saying?

30:58.857 --> 31:01.943
- No one suspects a brain-injured widow.
- They only look at Willy.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.695
- Willy confessed.
- Unless he didn't.

- Brain injury or no, how could Claudia...
- Girls can be engineers, too.

31:09.033 --> 31:12.996
When I was a kid, I told you I wanted
to be one, so you introduced me to Matthew

31:13.079 --> 31:14.831
who told me his wife was an engineer.

31:15.415 --> 31:18.167
- That was before your accident.
- You killed him.

31:18.751 --> 31:21.337
- You killed Matthew.
- No, I loved him.

31:21.421 --> 31:25.091
You killed him. He told me he was
leaving me even though I was sick.

31:25.174 --> 31:28.845
- Even though you were faking it.
- He didn't know. You took him from me.

31:28.928 --> 31:32.515

I saw my chance to do something,

No, no, I'm not gonna shoot her.

No, I want her to suffer
the same pain that she caused me.

You didn't have a choice.

He chose Cristal.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.357
I didn't wanna kill Matthew.
