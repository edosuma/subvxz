WEBVTT

00:46.255 --> 00:48.675
911, what's your emergency?

01:18.328 --> 01:19.747
Hands in the air!
Let me see your hands!

01:32.802 --> 01:35.472
7435.

01:50.528 --> 01:53.280
Okay, Aiden.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.990
Let's start.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.742
Tell us what happened.

02:05.585 --> 02:06.837
Hey, Melissa.

02:07.753 --> 02:08.588
You’re in trouble.

02:08.672 --> 02:10.005
They already started.

02:11.007 --> 02:13.467
Okay, so let's remember,
we have two types of readers.

02:13.552 --> 02:15.262
Readers who are wearing
these labels

02:15.345 --> 02:17.138
and readers who aspire
to wear these labels.

02:17.222 --> 02:18.263
AIDEN:
Sorry.

02:19.390 --> 02:20.808
Sorry, I'm late.

02:20.892 --> 02:22.268
As I was saying, that
Fashion East article

02:22.352 --> 02:23.435
was a good one.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.813
But let's not refer to that
one from New York.

02:25.897 --> 02:28.398
Um, what's her name?

02:29.483 --> 02:30.652
Anna Wintour?

02:30.735 --> 02:32.362
MICHAEL:
Yes, Anna Wintour!

02:32.445 --> 02:35.030
Avoid things like that
and we should be fine.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.910
Okay, moving on
to our next item.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.828
Something we've all been
waiting for.

02:40.912 --> 02:43.080
Something we've all worked
very hard for.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.833
Zelia is ours!

02:46.918 --> 02:48.418
Yes!

02:49.128 --> 02:50.170
Yes, oh my God.

02:50.255 --> 02:51.838
I don't have to tell you
how big this is for us.

02:51.923 --> 02:53.423
You all know very well.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.427
So, I'll be handing over
her account to our best.

02:59.555 --> 03:00.890
Daniel...

03:02.725 --> 03:04.310
...Zelia is yours.

03:06.145 --> 03:06.938
Oh!

03:07.022 --> 03:08.773
Oh, that's great!

03:08.857 --> 03:10.275
Thank you,
thank you, Michael.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.235
We'll meet this afternoon,
chart out a strategy.

03:12.318 --> 03:12.985
Yeah, yeah.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.778
-Abso-- absolutely.
-Okay.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.072
Okay.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.407
Alright, I wanna hear some
ideas about next month's issue.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.127
So, that meeting...

03:29.210 --> 03:31.587
...who's Zelia?

03:31.670 --> 03:33.172
Seriously?

03:33.255 --> 03:35.258
You are interning here

03:35.342 --> 03:38.260
and you don't know
who Zelia is?

03:39.553 --> 03:40.805
She's Toronto's hope for a real
legitimate standing

03:40.888 --> 03:42.223
in the fashion world!

03:43.808 --> 03:45.768
Okay, so you know we have fashion week

03:45.852 --> 03:47.270
every year here, right?

03:47.353 --> 03:51.273
Well, every year Zelia releases
her new collection here,

03:51.357 --> 03:54.610
instead of in London
or Paris or even New York.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.445
And every year people come
from all over

03:56.528 --> 03:58.698
just to see her new line.

03:58.782 --> 04:00.533
And if she keeps going the way
that she is,

04:00.617 --> 04:02.535
then those same designers
may wanna stay

04:02.618 --> 04:05.705
and compete with her here,
in Toronto.

04:05.788 --> 04:07.332
Okay.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.542
Well, that’d be good,
right?

04:09.625 --> 04:10.960
Yeah.

04:12.212 --> 04:13.170
Get back to work.

04:14.172 --> 04:15.548
SOPHIA:
Here.

04:15.632 --> 04:17.550
Take this to Maggie's office,
intern.

04:19.385 --> 04:21.637
It's uh, Aiden, actually.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.472
Oh, really?

04:33.232 --> 04:35.902
MAGGIE:
Sleeping around has its
benefits, right Daniel?

04:35.985 --> 04:36.987
What the hell, Maggie.

04:37.070 --> 04:40.155
I got the Zelia's account
because I'm good.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.033
I'm sure the boss' niece
would agree with you.

04:44.702 --> 04:45.787
Screw you, Maggie!

05:23.992 --> 05:25.242
MAGGIE:
What?

05:26.827 --> 05:27.912
What are you--

05:27.995 --> 05:28.913
Maggie.

05:28.997 --> 05:30.288
Have you see Daniel?

05:30.373 --> 05:31.373
No, I haven't.

05:31.457 --> 05:32.750
He must be on a smoke break.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.168
Okay, okay.

05:34.252 --> 05:35.712
Oh!

05:35.795 --> 05:37.213
Look at that!

05:37.297 --> 05:38.923
Made some adjustments
to the layout

05:39.007 --> 05:39.757
and colour palette.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.175
Oh, I--

05:41.258 --> 05:42.927
It's good, it's good.

05:43.010 --> 05:43.677
Thanks.

05:43.762 --> 05:45.262
Michael, do you have a minute?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.098
Yeah, sure what's up?

05:47.182 --> 05:48.767
The Zelia account.

05:48.850 --> 05:50.100
MICHAEL:
Alright.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.853
We're all trying to make this
the best magazine possible.

05:52.937 --> 05:54.605
So, I made the decision.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.440
Do you understand?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.192
Thanks.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.082
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:12.165 --> 06:14.417
I wouldn't go in there,
you know.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.918
AIDEN:
Is everything okay?

06:16.002 --> 06:19.380
SELVA:
Yeah, Celine's on the phone
with her sister in California.

06:19.463 --> 06:23.008
They're planning a hen party
or a baby shower

06:23.092 --> 06:24.968
or a presidential
inauguration ball.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.472
I didn't ask,
and I don't want to know

06:28.555 --> 06:30.975
until it's all over.

06:34.062 --> 06:35.897
Here.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.690
Thanks.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.283
Well.

06:47.367 --> 06:48.450
Everything alright?

06:48.533 --> 06:50.285
Magazine? School?

06:50.368 --> 06:53.622
Yeah, everything's fine.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.248
Good.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.713
You look like you
need a break.

07:00.797 --> 07:02.382
Oh, really?

07:02.465 --> 07:03.590
Yeah, you do.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.387
SELVA:
Hey.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.598
Why don't we go out
this weekend.

07:10.682 --> 07:13.517
Go out to the bar,
have a few drinks, relax.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.562
I can watch you pick up
some chicks.

07:15.645 --> 07:17.230
Hey, I could be your...

07:17.313 --> 07:17.980
...wingman!

07:19.482 --> 07:22.443
Bruh, I don't need a wingman.

07:22.527 --> 07:27.573
Uh yeah, you do, bruh!

07:35.748 --> 07:37.833
You're late again.

07:37.917 --> 07:41.420
I know, sorry.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.755
I had to finish this huge
assignment.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.383
My professor,
I swear he's trying to kill us

07:46.467 --> 07:48.802
with all these--

07:52.013 --> 07:54.808
Daniel and Maggie,

07:54.892 --> 07:56.310
weren't they going out before?

07:58.562 --> 07:59.355
I don't know.

07:59.438 --> 08:00.815
Why are you asking me?

08:00.898 --> 08:03.233
Well, you know the real scoop
on everything

08:03.317 --> 08:05.318
that goes on around here, no?

08:06.278 --> 08:07.780
Don't believe everything
you hear.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.782
So they weren't going out

08:09.865 --> 08:12.827
or you don't know everything
that goes on around here?

08:20.752 --> 08:22.420
What is going on in here!

08:22.503 --> 08:23.837
Oh, my God, you are bleeding!

08:25.130 --> 08:27.173
That looks like it might need
a couple of stitches.

08:27.258 --> 08:29.510
Take her to Scarborough General,
okay?

08:29.593 --> 08:32.513
Daniel, can I see you
in my office please.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.348
You...

08:36.517 --> 08:38.352
...Aiden, right?

08:38.435 --> 08:39.770
Clean this up...

08:39.853 --> 08:42.523
...and when you're done,
just lock up, okay?

08:43.773 --> 08:45.358
Okay.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.008
Pardon me.

09:51.092 --> 09:52.008
Who are you?

09:52.092 --> 09:55.680
-Exactly?
-I'm Aiden.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.138
I'm an intern.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.142
Was that a question?

09:59.225 --> 10:01.352
MAGGIE:
How long have you been
an intern?

10:01.435 --> 10:03.020
Almost two months.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.402
You did that?

10:09.485 --> 10:11.237
Yeah...

10:11.320 --> 10:13.905
...Sorry, I shouldn't have
messed with your project.

10:13.990 --> 10:16.617
You changed the whole layout.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.868
Yeah, I--

10:18.952 --> 10:21.580
Rally sorry.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.958
I just thought
I'd try something.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.638
Do you think this colour
will suit Aiden?

10:38.805 --> 10:41.058
Yeah, it'll suit him well.

10:41.142 --> 10:43.977
You didn't even look.

10:44.062 --> 10:46.188
I don't have to look,
I can see it.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.815
Of course you can.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.653
It's Peter's favourite.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.825
Our Peter would have been
Aiden's age, now.

11:01.953 --> 11:05.165
He's a handsome young man.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.833
Mhmm.

11:06.917 --> 11:10.295
Sometimes, I think Aiden looks just like Peter.

11:18.137 --> 11:19.805
Celine...

11:22.392 --> 11:26.478
...you know Aiden is not Peter.

11:26.562 --> 11:28.980
Aiden can never become Peter.

11:51.087 --> 11:52.505
AIDEN:
Hey.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.468
I have some news for you.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.930
I'm waiting.

12:01.013 --> 12:04.350
Maggie wants to be your mentor.

12:04.433 --> 12:05.600
What?

12:05.683 --> 12:08.520
She sent in a request to HR.

12:08.603 --> 12:09.688
How do you know that?

12:09.772 --> 12:12.023
I know everything, remember?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.073
What are you doing here?

12:20.157 --> 12:21.658
Oh, nothing.

12:21.742 --> 12:22.618
Homework.

12:22.702 --> 12:25.203
Okay, put that away,
and look at this.

12:30.877 --> 12:32.210
Track suits?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.338
Velour track suits!

12:35.923 --> 12:36.965
It's so ridiculous!

12:37.048 --> 12:39.843
Who wears tracksuits outside
of the gym?

12:39.927 --> 12:41.470
Actually, people do.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.387
Oh really?

12:42.472 --> 12:44.973
Yeah, I see it all the time.

12:45.057 --> 12:48.185
I think Kanye wore one
to the Grammys one time.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.228
That was four years ago!

12:50.312 --> 12:52.482
In the fashion world,
it's like ancient!

12:52.565 --> 12:56.402
Yeah, but uh,
we could revive it, you know.

12:56.485 --> 12:59.028
Uh, keep this.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.948
Get rid of that...

13:01.032 --> 13:02.992
...and voilà!

13:03.075 --> 13:04.160
What?

13:04.243 --> 13:05.285
It'll work!

13:07.078 --> 13:08.997
I'm not sure.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.542
Anyway, put your thoughts
on paper and show me.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.877
Okay.

13:39.570 --> 13:41.197
-DANIEL: Hey.
-Hi.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.867
You know,...

13:46.910 --> 13:49.455
...tracksuits were my idea!

13:49.538 --> 13:52.123
They were my project.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.835
Michael just gave 'em to you?

13:54.918 --> 13:57.630
Yes, he did!

13:58.880 --> 13:59.757
MAGGIE:
Come in.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.092
-Hey.
-Hi Aiden.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.175
Come in.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.678
This is Aiden, my new intern.

14:04.762 --> 14:05.930
Hi.

14:09.350 --> 14:11.727
Daniel was just about to leave.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.395
Yeah.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.813
Good luck.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.655
What was that all about?

14:22.738 --> 14:25.407
It's fine, leave it.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.285
Anyways uh, take a look
at this proposal.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.870
There's some really good stuff
in here.

14:30.955 --> 14:34.750
Oh, and uh I was hoping we would
be done early today.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.377
Why? Have a date?

14:37.460 --> 14:39.713
No, uh,
just a friend and I.

14:39.797 --> 14:41.548
We're going to a bar,
to catch up.

14:41.632 --> 14:44.050
Oh well, I know a great bar!

14:44.133 --> 14:47.387
Good food, great drinks,
nice atmosphere.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.055
We uh...

14:49.138 --> 14:50.765
...go there a lot.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.768
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.647
I think you've had enough
Daniel.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.023
You should go home.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.903
So, this is the watering hole?

15:02.987 --> 15:05.488
Yeah, I guess so.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.990
Nice.

15:08.617 --> 15:11.745
So, you know that girl
I was telling you about?

15:11.828 --> 15:14.582
The sexy girl
with the kinky boots?

15:14.665 --> 15:15.498
Who?

15:15.582 --> 15:16.833
The lingerie model?

15:16.917 --> 15:18.418
What are you talking about?

15:18.502 --> 15:19.878
I don't know any lingerie models

15:19.962 --> 15:22.463
or girls with kinky boots.

15:22.547 --> 15:23.757
Are you sure?

15:23.840 --> 15:24.883
You can tell me.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.552
I'll totally listen to all
your stories

15:26.635 --> 15:28.762
about the sexy sirens
you run into.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.433
Hi, how are you today?

15:33.517 --> 15:34.183
Uh, good.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.560
-How are you?
-Good!

15:35.643 --> 15:36.812
And what would you like?

15:36.895 --> 15:39.147
Our specials today are
the Von Sports-bar Burger

15:39.230 --> 15:40.898
or the Enforcer.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.483
-I'll do the Enforcer.
-Mhmm.

15:42.567 --> 15:43.985
And for you?

15:44.068 --> 15:46.197
Uh, beer is good.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.155
Just water.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.240
Alright, coming right up.

15:51.702 --> 15:54.788
I don't think you understand
what happens at our magazine.

15:54.872 --> 15:58.375
There’s no 'spicy sirens'
walking around.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.502
No?

16:01.462 --> 16:03.380
At least, not until summer.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.923
Oh, when the swimsuit issue
comes out.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.220
Anyways....

16:10.303 --> 16:13.390
No, it's my mentor at work.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.100
Is she hot?

16:15.183 --> 16:17.268
Like you wouldn't believe!

16:17.352 --> 16:21.440
And she's smart
and sophisticated.

16:21.523 --> 16:22.983
Totally classy!

16:27.905 --> 16:32.075
Smart, sophisticated mentor.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.743
That's not what I pictured.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.293
Oh-- that's not her.

16:42.377 --> 16:43.795
That's Sophia.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.463
She's another one
of my colleagues.

16:45.547 --> 16:46.548
We hang out sometimes.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.970
Oh, I get it!
You got two birds in the net.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.517
No, it's not that.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.188
It's the guy
that she's talking to.

17:01.272 --> 17:03.107
What about him?

17:03.190 --> 17:04.858
He's an asshole!

17:04.942 --> 17:06.860
He’s always messing with Maggie.

17:10.447 --> 17:11.407
SELVA:
Maggie.

17:11.490 --> 17:12.950
Your mentor, the smart one?

17:13.033 --> 17:15.910
That's walking by us,
right now?

17:19.330 --> 17:21.375
DANIEL:
Hey, Maggie.

17:21.458 --> 17:22.250
Daniel?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.420
-I wanna talk to you.
-What about?

17:24.503 --> 17:26.130
-You're drunk.
-No, I'm not!

17:26.213 --> 17:27.047
We'll talk when you’re sober.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.048
What are talk--
no, no, no.

17:28.132 --> 17:28.965
You come back here.

17:29.048 --> 17:29.967
-Okay.
-Do not--

17:30.050 --> 17:31.385
Why don't you just go back
to Starbucks

17:31.468 --> 17:32.718
and have your face--

17:32.803 --> 17:33.428
Shit!

17:33.512 --> 17:34.597
Woah, woah, woah!

17:34.680 --> 17:35.972
What the fuck, man!

17:36.055 --> 17:36.890
Hey, Aiden, wait!

17:36.973 --> 17:38.225
Mind your fucking business.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.143
Get the fuck out,
you're dismissed!

17:40.227 --> 17:41.562
AIDEN:
You're at the bar,
you hit a girl!

17:41.645 --> 17:42.187
Fuck you!

18:03.208 --> 18:05.127
SELVA:
Well, that was interesting.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.840
Never been in a bar fight
before.

18:12.050 --> 18:15.303
Actually never even seen
a bar fight in my entire life.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.575
SELVA:
Black right?

18:37.658 --> 18:40.537
Yeah, thanks.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.207
No problem.

18:50.963 --> 18:55.135
Aiden, I know,
I'm not your father or anything.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.932
And I'm not trying to give you
a lecture

19:01.015 --> 19:05.062
but honestly, man,
none of this looks good.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.563
You were there!

19:07.647 --> 19:08.732
You saw what happened!

19:08.815 --> 19:09.817
He pushed her!

19:09.900 --> 19:10.983
Hey!

19:11.067 --> 19:13.070
I was right there.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.237
I saw what he did.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.867
But I saw what you did.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.952
I didn't start it.

19:20.035 --> 19:22.537
SELVA:
Look man,

19:22.620 --> 19:24.413
I know you got
a thing for this girl.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.873
And I get that.

19:27.792 --> 19:31.045
But you're just started
in life.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.090
And all this fighting
and brawling,

19:33.173 --> 19:35.300
it's just gonna ruin it.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.137
Yeah.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.017
Yeah.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.353
I got that.

19:49.898 --> 19:50.565
AIDEN:
Hey.

19:50.648 --> 19:51.817
Hey.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.320
Oh, my God, that looks horrible.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.322
You should have taken a day off.

19:57.405 --> 19:58.657
I Couldn't.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.243
Gotta finish this project
for Maggie.

20:04.287 --> 20:05.872
Hello.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.458
Yeah, he's here.

20:08.542 --> 20:11.043
Okay, I'll let him know.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.462
Michael wants to see you.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.965
Me?
Was he mad?

20:15.048 --> 20:16.800
Sort of.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.385
Does he know about yesterday?

20:18.468 --> 20:20.803
I don’t know,
but I didn't tell him.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.723
Is he gonna fire me?

20:23.807 --> 20:26.602
I hope not,
but you better go now.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.612
Come on in.

20:37.695 --> 20:38.905
Have a seat.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.330
I'm not gonna ask you
why you and Daniel look like

20:47.413 --> 20:50.583
you went three rounds
in a boxing ring last night.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.085
Did you really think I wouldn't
find out

20:52.168 --> 20:53.503
that two of my employees
have been placed

20:53.587 --> 20:54.630
under a Peace Bond?

20:54.713 --> 20:57.257
-I can explain we just--
-Please don't.

20:57.340 --> 21:00.177
I'm sure it seemed perfectly
justified at the time.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.928
I don't really care.

21:02.012 --> 21:05.265
What I do care about,
and what you should care about,

21:05.348 --> 21:06.975
is appearances.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.518
It’s a fashion magazine,
Aiden.

21:08.602 --> 21:11.980
Appearance is everything.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.232
-I apologize.
-MICHAEL: I'm not done yet.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.067
Some of our investors
will be here today

21:16.150 --> 21:17.360
to look at the project
you and Maggie

21:17.443 --> 21:18.737
have been working on.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.947
But I can't have ‘em
seeing you looking like this.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.823
So, go home.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.620
I-- I still didn't finish the--

21:26.703 --> 21:29.622
Maggie will finish it,
whatever it is.

21:29.707 --> 21:30.707
Look, kid.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.167
You got talent.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.002
But that's not enough
to get noticed.

21:34.085 --> 21:36.003
Not in this business.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.757
You don't want these people
to remember you

21:38.840 --> 21:41.092
as the kid with the black eye.

21:41.175 --> 21:44.888
So I'm doing this favour,
for you and for me.

21:44.972 --> 21:46.305
Go home now.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.398
Aiden, where were you?

21:55.482 --> 21:56.567
They'll be here in half an hour.

21:56.650 --> 21:59.360
And you still need to finish--

21:59.443 --> 22:01.363
Your face!

22:01.447 --> 22:05.658
Oh my God, I may have some concealer in my purse.

22:05.742 --> 22:09.245
No, no, no, it's too late.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.747
Michael is sending me home.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.292
What?

22:13.375 --> 22:15.918
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.753
Oh, no, no, no.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.840
He's sending me home
for the day.

22:19.923 --> 22:21.842
Oh, okay.

22:21.925 --> 22:24.720
For a minute I thought that--

22:24.803 --> 22:26.430
It's all my fault.

22:26.513 --> 22:30.350
No, it's not.

22:30.433 --> 22:32.518
I should keep my temper
in check.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.938
You got hurt defending me.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.442
I'm so...

22:42.028 --> 22:45.490
No one's ever been there for me,
like you.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.747
Anyways, I'll--
I'll see you tomorrow.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.167
Yeah.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.722
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be at work?

23:08.805 --> 23:10.557
Huh?

23:10.640 --> 23:13.352
Oh, God, I know that look.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.645
What look?

23:15.728 --> 23:17.022
Come with me.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.610
Alright, lay it on me.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.068
What?

23:23.153 --> 23:25.030
I know that face.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.197
Yeah, of course you do.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.115
It's my face.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.032
No, no.

23:28.117 --> 23:29.200
That's not what I mean.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.247
Oh God!

23:34.957 --> 23:36.833
Now you begin to understand.

23:38.502 --> 23:40.045
Want a beer?

23:40.128 --> 23:40.920
Yeah.

23:44.382 --> 23:46.092
You know, you've lost it,
haven't you.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.760
I've lost it?

23:47.843 --> 23:50.722
You're the one that's lost
your internship over a girl.

23:50.805 --> 23:51.765
At least she was hot!

23:54.977 --> 23:56.687
I didn't lose my internship.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.605
They just sent me home
for the day.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.483
Yeah?

24:01.567 --> 24:02.942
Good!

24:05.445 --> 24:07.197
So...

24:07.280 --> 24:10.283
...what did she say?

24:10.367 --> 24:13.328
Nothing, she just thanked me.

24:13.412 --> 24:15.080
And?

24:15.163 --> 24:17.332
And...

24:17.415 --> 24:18.917
...kissed me on the cheek.

24:20.585 --> 24:22.170
She kissed you on the cheek.

24:22.253 --> 24:24.047
-The cheek?
-Yeah! The cheek!

24:25.590 --> 24:28.760
You have a restraining order
against you because of her,

24:28.843 --> 24:30.512
and she just kissed you
on the cheek?

24:30.595 --> 24:33.723
It's a peace bond,
it’s not a restraining order.

24:33.807 --> 24:34.892
Yeah, whatever.

24:36.893 --> 24:39.020
I've been meaning to ask you.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.815
How does that work when you guys actually work together?

24:41.898 --> 24:45.235
Well, there is an exception
for uh...

24:45.318 --> 24:48.822
Incidental contact during
the course of employment,

24:48.905 --> 24:50.490
something like that.

24:50.573 --> 24:51.533
Hmm.

24:53.327 --> 24:55.245
But she just kissed you
on the cheek

24:55.328 --> 24:57.913
and you're this far gone?

24:57.997 --> 24:58.623
Hey!

24:59.917 --> 25:02.752
We all make fools of ourselves
one time or another.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.462
But at least I'm here

25:04.545 --> 25:07.923
to help you through
the elementary school stage.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.467
Do you like me?

25:09.550 --> 25:12.178
Answer, yes or no.

25:12.262 --> 25:13.095
Oh, God!

25:13.178 --> 25:14.222
Just shut up,
get me another beer.

25:56.347 --> 25:57.807
Honey.

25:59.267 --> 26:00.727
Honey.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.772
Selva.

26:04.855 --> 26:06.023
Can we do this some other time?

26:06.107 --> 26:08.652
I'm watching the game.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.697
You need to look at this.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.407
What is it?

26:27.503 --> 26:29.922
You been going through
Aiden's things?

26:30.007 --> 26:31.925
Of course not!
I was just clearing

26:32.008 --> 26:34.343
his room of dirty dishes
and I happened across these

26:34.427 --> 26:37.388
on his desk.

26:37.472 --> 26:40.267
You need to talk to him.

26:40.350 --> 26:41.433
Hmm.

26:45.105 --> 26:46.022
I have a suggestion.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.732
Go ahead.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.358
What if for the new designer
spread,

26:49.442 --> 26:50.943
we take pictures from a show,

26:51.027 --> 26:53.822
and split them with pictures of regular women on the street

26:53.905 --> 26:54.990
wearing the same clothes.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.702
Except that we don't have
any pictures of regular people

26:58.785 --> 26:59.743
wearing those clothes.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.663
Yeah, but we could go downtown
and take some.

27:02.747 --> 27:04.665
This isn't exactly New York,

27:04.748 --> 27:09.337
and you're not exactly been
to Benjamin Cunningham.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.005
I realize that.

27:11.088 --> 27:14.175
But we could just hire
some freelancers.

27:14.258 --> 27:17.678
That is an excellent idea.

27:17.762 --> 27:19.013
You’re right.

27:19.097 --> 27:21.515
Most of our photographers are
only capturing well-known faces.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.393
It's time we got some pictures
of ordinary people

27:23.477 --> 27:25.353
wearing these clothes.

27:25.437 --> 27:27.813
I'll put out some feelers,
we'll see what turns up.

27:33.778 --> 27:36.113
I like this.

27:36.197 --> 27:39.158
But uh, marble background?

27:39.242 --> 27:40.993
Oh, we just wanted to--

27:41.077 --> 27:43.997
You know, just show--
to uh--

27:44.080 --> 27:47.625
In order to--
Showcase the uh--

27:49.085 --> 27:51.045
For, for--

27:51.128 --> 27:53.507
I thought it'd show
the versatility of the cut

27:53.590 --> 27:54.632
and the flow of the fabric.

27:55.592 --> 27:58.052
And uh, marbles actually
really in right now.

27:58.135 --> 28:01.347
And the red in the dress,
the red in the letters.

28:01.430 --> 28:02.473
They balance each other out.

28:02.557 --> 28:03.517
MICHAEL:
I see.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.812
You seem to have a good
instinct.

28:07.895 --> 28:09.730
I'm glad to see his progress,
Maggie.

28:09.813 --> 28:10.815
Me too.

28:10.898 --> 28:12.983
Alright.
Well, carry on.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.545
AIDEN:
What's wrong?

28:32.628 --> 28:33.505
Maggie?

28:33.588 --> 28:35.340
I'm fine.

28:35.423 --> 28:37.717
You don't look fine.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.387
I'm fine.
I just thought I saw someone.

28:40.470 --> 28:42.055
Saw who?

28:42.138 --> 28:43.263
No one, leave it.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.183
Was someone there?

28:48.185 --> 28:49.187
I think...

28:50.897 --> 28:52.648
...But I don't want you
in trouble again.

28:55.152 --> 28:57.945
It's Daniel, isn't it?

28:58.028 --> 29:00.740
It's fine,
I can take care of myself.

29:00.823 --> 29:02.700
I know you can.

29:02.783 --> 29:08.372
Maggie, you're smart,
you're talented, you're strong.

29:08.457 --> 29:11.042
I know you can take care
of yourself,

29:11.125 --> 29:12.627
but I wanna help you.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.757
I don't want you to get
involved in this too much.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.758
That's for me to decide.

29:19.842 --> 29:21.845
Well, at first,...

29:23.805 --> 29:26.598
...I thought
it was my imagination,

29:26.682 --> 29:29.685
but then, one evening,

29:29.768 --> 29:33.815
I saw him waiting by my car,
when I got off work late.

29:33.898 --> 29:35.023
When was this?

29:35.107 --> 29:37.568
MAGGIE:
After you and I took over
the Zelia account.

29:37.652 --> 29:39.987
He left when he saw that
I wasn't alone--

29:40.070 --> 29:41.280
Robert was with me.

29:44.325 --> 29:46.660
And the other day...

29:46.743 --> 29:48.245
...I spotted him outside
my house.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.372
What?

29:49.455 --> 29:51.332
It was dark, so I couldn't see
his face clearly.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.458
But I swear I saw his car
in my neighbourhood

29:53.543 --> 29:55.670
and he doesn't even live nearby.

29:55.753 --> 29:59.257
He lives in the opposite end
of the town and...

30:01.342 --> 30:06.013
...there were footprints outside
my window next morning.

30:06.097 --> 30:07.765
Maggie, this is serious.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.350
You need to call the police.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.855
Just do me one favour.

30:17.442 --> 30:20.903
Call me, if you spot him,

30:20.987 --> 30:23.615
or if you can't sleep at night,

30:23.698 --> 30:25.992
or if there's an axe-wielding
murderer outside your door.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.535
Aiden!

30:27.618 --> 30:31.163
Sorry, poor choice of words.

30:31.247 --> 30:34.000
I'm just trying to say,

30:34.083 --> 30:37.253
even if you just need someone
to talk to for a little while,

30:37.337 --> 30:38.838
call me.

30:38.922 --> 30:41.007
If anything happens...

30:41.090 --> 30:44.927
...whatever it is, just call me,
okay?

30:47.347 --> 30:50.182
You could sleep on my couch...

30:50.267 --> 30:52.268
...very comfortable.

30:53.978 --> 30:57.023
I'm sure it is.

30:57.107 --> 30:58.065
All right, I'll call you.

30:58.148 --> 30:59.608
Now, let me drop you home.

31:01.277 --> 31:04.780
Okay, let's go.

31:19.128 --> 31:22.298
Hello? Maggie?

31:22.382 --> 31:23.382
M-- Ma-- Mag-- Maggie,

31:23.465 --> 31:25.468
Maggie-- Mag-- slow down.
I can't understand!

31:28.012 --> 31:29.222
I'm coming over, okay?
No, no!

31:29.305 --> 31:30.598
Keep your phone with you,
call the cops

31:30.682 --> 31:31.848
if he tries anything, okay?

31:31.933 --> 31:32.975
I'm on my way.

31:39.023 --> 31:40.775
Hey, where are you going
at this hour?

31:42.485 --> 31:44.195
Don't you have a test tomorrow?

31:46.155 --> 31:46.905
Aiden?

31:46.990 --> 31:47.657
It's an emergency.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.075
I'll be back soon.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.507
Maggie, open up!

32:14.350 --> 32:15.100
AIDEN:
Maggie, Maggie!

32:15.183 --> 32:16.893
Maggie, are you okay?

32:16.978 --> 32:18.062
The backyard...

32:18.145 --> 32:19.730
...I think he's in the backyard.

32:19.813 --> 32:21.232
-No, wait!
-No, no, no!

32:21.315 --> 32:21.773
It's okay.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.067
I'm just gonna--

32:23.150 --> 32:25.820
Stay here, okay?
Call the police.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.822
Don't move!

32:27.905 --> 32:30.073
-Don't move, okay?
-Okay.

32:55.475 --> 32:56.392
He's gone.

32:56.475 --> 32:57.810
He must have left when--

32:57.893 --> 32:58.812
When he heard me.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.280
I should clean this up.

33:10.365 --> 33:12.200
No, no, no, no.
I got that.

33:12.283 --> 33:13.993
Why isn't the squad car
here yet?

33:14.077 --> 33:16.703
We need to clean this up,
someone could get hurt.

33:16.787 --> 33:17.955
No, no, no.
Maggie, careful!

33:18.998 --> 33:20.290
Oh my God!

33:20.375 --> 33:22.168
I'm so sorry.
Let me look.

33:23.795 --> 33:25.797
It's not too deep. Thank God!

33:25.880 --> 33:27.507
Do you have a first aid kit?

33:27.590 --> 33:29.175
Yeah. In the bathroom, upstairs.

33:33.805 --> 33:35.347
AIDEN:
What did the police say?

33:35.432 --> 33:36.848
I didn't call them.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.100
AIDEN:
What?

33:38.183 --> 33:39.352
Maggie, Maggie!

33:39.435 --> 33:40.978
You need to call them!

33:43.022 --> 33:44.232
He broke your window.

33:44.315 --> 33:45.483
He tried to get in!

33:45.567 --> 33:47.902
You need to have a record
of this.

34:19.058 --> 34:21.935
Are you okay?

34:22.018 --> 34:24.063
You hear that?

34:24.147 --> 34:26.440
Hear what?

34:26.523 --> 34:28.442
Fish.

34:30.528 --> 34:33.823
I'm pretty sure that's a dog.

34:33.907 --> 34:35.658
Just like Fish.

34:41.497 --> 34:43.623
Fish was a dog.

34:43.707 --> 34:46.377
AIDEN:
A dog?

34:46.460 --> 34:48.295
Who names their dog, Fish?

34:48.378 --> 34:49.630
I should go clean that up.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.548
No, no, no.
I got that.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.133
No, it's fine.
I can do it myself.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.553
Maggie, you're hurt.

34:55.637 --> 34:58.055
Let me do it.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.432
Do really want to argue
over this?

35:00.517 --> 35:03.393
Do you have something better
to argue about?

35:03.477 --> 35:07.982
Yeah, actually I was thinking
about getting a pet.

35:08.065 --> 35:09.942
Maybe a goldfish.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.235
Should I call it 'Cat'?

35:20.410 --> 35:22.120
AIDEN:
So, what happened to Fish?

36:05.497 --> 36:08.500
I should've done something
to save him.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.545
Maggie.

36:10.628 --> 36:13.797
You were just a kid.

36:13.882 --> 36:16.550
Don't be so hard on yourself.

36:16.633 --> 36:19.387
I won't let anyone make me
feel like that again.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.812
What do I make you feel?

36:33.317 --> 36:34.652
You?

36:38.990 --> 36:41.867
You make me...

36:41.908 --> 36:43.077
...wonder.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.997
Wonder?

36:48.457 --> 36:50.710
Wonder what?

36:50.793 --> 36:54.255
Wonder about...

36:54.338 --> 36:56.423
...How do I make you feel?

36:59.177 --> 37:03.180
You make me feel weak...

37:05.767 --> 37:08.352
...and strong...

37:08.435 --> 37:10.103
at the same time.

37:11.105 --> 37:13.357
Really?

37:13.440 --> 37:15.693
Yeah.

37:15.777 --> 37:19.530
Being with me might be
dangerous.

37:19.613 --> 37:21.532
A little danger is good
for the soul.

37:23.952 --> 37:25.995
You are so impulsive.

37:26.078 --> 37:28.413
Oh yeah?

37:28.497 --> 37:31.417
I think I'm falling for you.

37:32.335 --> 37:36.005
And that's a bad thing?

37:36.088 --> 37:38.548
Well, it means that...

37:38.632 --> 37:41.093
...if you stay,...

37:41.177 --> 37:45.013
I won't ever let you leave.

37:46.182 --> 37:47.850
Still waiting for the bad news.

37:56.067 --> 37:59.445
You know, your couch...

37:59.528 --> 38:01.947
...really does look nice.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.425
AIDEN:
Oh God.

38:21.508 --> 38:22.968
-MAGGIE: Right here?
-AIDEN: Yeah.

38:32.895 --> 38:34.313
They still watching?

38:34.397 --> 38:36.648
Yeah.

38:36.732 --> 38:38.233
I kinda ran out in a hurry
last night

38:38.317 --> 38:39.527
without explaining anything.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.653
They're probably up all night,
worried.

38:41.737 --> 38:44.240
To me, they don't look worried;
they look curious.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.742
Do you want me to introduce you?

38:45.825 --> 38:48.618
Oh, hey, I don't think we are
at 'meet the parents' stage.

38:48.702 --> 38:49.703
Oh, no, no.

38:49.787 --> 38:51.163
Those aren't my parents,
they're just friends.

38:51.247 --> 38:53.707
But they’re as close as family.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.877
And you want me to make
a good impression?

38:55.960 --> 38:58.462
Look, that-- that's not
what I meant.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.172
Okay then, why are you
hesitating?

39:00.255 --> 39:01.048
Why don't you introduce us?

39:01.132 --> 39:02.215
Invite me in for coffee?

39:02.298 --> 39:03.717
I thought you had to get to
work.

39:03.800 --> 39:04.677
Okay, yeah.

39:04.760 --> 39:05.593
It's probably just best
that I leave,

39:05.677 --> 39:08.013
like some one-night mistake,
right?

39:08.097 --> 39:10.557
What? No, that’s-- that's not
what I meant.

39:11.600 --> 39:12.477
Why? I'm--

39:12.560 --> 39:13.893
I'm the 'morning after' girl,
right?

39:13.977 --> 39:15.353
AIDEN:
What? No!

39:15.437 --> 39:17.313
Then say what you meant,
Aiden.

39:17.398 --> 39:18.440
MAGGIE:
Do you regret last night?

39:18.523 --> 39:19.942
What? No!

39:20.025 --> 39:22.403
It’s just I have a test
to take in--

39:22.487 --> 39:23.820
Shit! One hour!

39:23.903 --> 39:26.198
And honestly, now is not
the best time for this.

39:26.282 --> 39:28.700
Okay, in that case let me know
when the best time for this is,

39:28.742 --> 39:30.535
and I'll pencil you
in my schedule.

39:43.548 --> 39:44.592
Hey, I was drinking that!

39:44.675 --> 39:46.093
It’s gotten cold.
I'll get you a fresh one.

39:46.177 --> 39:47.010
And for you too, Aiden?

39:47.093 --> 39:48.345
No, I'm late for class.

39:50.222 --> 39:51.348
Women!

39:56.103 --> 39:58.855
Oh, you’re back early!

40:01.358 --> 40:02.527
What was that about?

40:02.610 --> 40:03.443
What?

40:03.527 --> 40:05.278
Oh, that?

40:05.362 --> 40:07.615
Not now, Aiden.
We'll talk later.

40:07.698 --> 40:10.408
I uh, think we should talk now.

40:10.492 --> 40:12.662
Well, in that case for starters,

40:12.745 --> 40:14.413
no one gets to judge me.

40:14.497 --> 40:15.915
Judged?

40:15.998 --> 40:17.750
Is that what you think
my friends would do?

40:17.833 --> 40:19.000
I know what you think

40:19.083 --> 40:22.420
and what you said.

40:22.505 --> 40:23.797
I didn't say anything.

40:23.880 --> 40:24.715
Yes, you did.

40:24.798 --> 40:25.715
You were like,
'Oh, I'm wanna make

40:25.800 --> 40:26.633
a good impression and shit'.

40:26.717 --> 40:27.760
And it was just like--

40:33.973 --> 40:36.810
Um, what is going on here?

40:39.480 --> 40:40.730
Elijah.

40:40.815 --> 40:42.775
This is Aiden,
the one I was telling you about.

40:42.858 --> 40:46.945
Aiden, this is Elijah,
best publisher in the city.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.738
Nice to meet you.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.448
ELIJAH:
Nice to meet you.

40:50.532 --> 40:51.492
AIDEN:
Sir.

40:55.662 --> 40:56.663
MICHAEL:
Yeah.

40:56.747 --> 40:58.165
Why don't I walk with you
to the door.

41:08.717 --> 41:10.302
AIDEN:
You wanted to see me?

41:10.385 --> 41:12.220
Yeah, come on in.

41:18.685 --> 41:21.772
You know, I see a lot of myself
in you.

41:21.855 --> 41:24.983
Your enthusiasm for the work,
your skill,

41:25.067 --> 41:26.693
your aptitude.

41:26.777 --> 41:29.947
You are young,
but you have potential.

41:30.030 --> 41:32.533
How far you go
with that potential

41:32.617 --> 41:34.327
is entirely up to you.

41:37.078 --> 41:38.580
You may not know this,

41:38.663 --> 41:41.083
but Elijah is more than
a friend; he's my mentor.

41:41.167 --> 41:42.918
Helped me get started
in the publishing industry.

41:43.002 --> 41:46.838
I wanted you to meet him,
but now?

41:46.922 --> 41:48.090
After that?

41:52.510 --> 41:56.432
You know that in this industry,
reputation matters a lot.

41:56.515 --> 41:58.767
You have to work hard
to earn one.

41:58.850 --> 42:02.020
With your potential
you could go far, Aiden.

42:02.103 --> 42:06.483
But first,
get your act together.

42:06.567 --> 42:07.735
And get out.

42:24.377 --> 42:25.335
Ahan!

42:25.418 --> 42:27.963
I see there's a party
going on here.

42:28.047 --> 42:29.715
Yes, and you are not invited.

42:31.717 --> 42:32.802
Oh, okay.

42:32.885 --> 42:35.137
I'll just go see what Jennifer
next door is doing.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.513
Mr. Matin, get back here, now!

42:37.598 --> 42:39.683
What were you saying, honey?

42:39.767 --> 42:40.808
I'll get your coffee.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.728
AIDEN:
Get in there.

42:47.148 --> 42:48.358
She might be lonely.

42:48.442 --> 42:49.150
Yeah.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.320
-There ya go.
-Thanks, man.

42:57.408 --> 42:58.410
Hi, Maggie.

43:00.078 --> 43:01.622
Yeah, I sent it to the printer.

43:04.082 --> 43:04.917
Sure.

43:05.000 --> 43:05.960
I'll check,
first thing tomorrow.

43:08.545 --> 43:09.253
Okay.

43:11.298 --> 43:12.048
Bye.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.343
How is Maggie?

43:15.427 --> 43:16.887
Yeah, how is Maggie?

43:18.555 --> 43:20.307
You must have her over someday.

43:21.433 --> 43:22.600
I will.

43:23.393 --> 43:24.603
Oh, um.

43:24.687 --> 43:27.522
Sophia, Kevin, and I are going
to a movie tomorrow night.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.650
It's like dinner and a movie.

43:29.733 --> 43:30.985
So, I'll be home late.

43:31.068 --> 43:32.485
-Oh, well.
-Oh, shit.

44:13.277 --> 44:14.570
AIDEN:
Hey, Maggie.

44:14.653 --> 44:16.947
Where is it? I couldn't find it.

44:17.030 --> 44:18.365
Couldn't find what?

44:21.618 --> 44:22.870
Uh--

44:22.953 --> 44:23.787
Here.

44:26.665 --> 44:29.208
I also need to discuss
something with you.

44:30.252 --> 44:31.587
Yeah,
what is it?

44:31.670 --> 44:33.922
Why are you so pally
with Sophia?

44:35.965 --> 44:37.843
What are you talking about?

44:37.927 --> 44:39.010
I work with her.

44:39.093 --> 44:42.388
Yes, but you don't need to be
so close.

44:42.472 --> 44:44.392
Maggie, what are you trying
to say?

44:44.475 --> 44:45.558
I don't like it.

44:47.937 --> 44:51.357
I told you my story
the other day.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.818
What I didn't tell you
was that my father left my mom

44:54.902 --> 44:57.028
for another woman.

44:58.572 --> 45:00.740
Move in with me.

45:00.823 --> 45:01.742
What?

45:01.825 --> 45:02.658
I want you with me.

45:02.743 --> 45:04.537
I want you near me,
all the time.

45:07.663 --> 45:10.042
-Ma-- Maggie, I--
-Is there a problem?

45:10.125 --> 45:12.252
No, no, the--
there's no problem.

45:12.335 --> 45:13.337
Then?

45:16.673 --> 45:19.258
Don't you love me?

45:19.342 --> 45:22.137
I do, it's just--

45:30.728 --> 45:32.563
Okay.

45:36.902 --> 45:38.362
I will.

45:54.462 --> 45:56.380
SELVA:
You sure about this?

45:56.463 --> 45:58.590
No.

45:58.673 --> 46:01.843
But I love her.

46:01.927 --> 46:04.680
I wanna be with her.

46:04.763 --> 46:07.515
Alright,
and when this all falls apart,

46:07.598 --> 46:09.225
you better come running back
to me.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.602
‘Cause I don't get a chance
to say,

46:10.685 --> 46:12.312
I told you so
very often.

46:18.527 --> 46:20.070
MAGGIE:
Phew.

46:20.153 --> 46:22.238
Moving in is so exhausting.

46:24.533 --> 46:27.118
You bet, it is.

46:27.202 --> 46:28.995
-Do you want coffee?
-AIDEN: Yeah.

46:30.372 --> 46:31.957
That would be good.

46:32.040 --> 46:33.208
Okay, go get it.

46:40.048 --> 46:42.217
-One for me too.
-AIDEN: Yeah, yeah.

46:42.300 --> 46:44.052
Thanks, Aiden.

46:54.522 --> 46:56.063
He only has a one-hour window.

46:56.147 --> 46:57.732
Do you want me to say yes?

46:57.815 --> 46:58.442
Yeah!

46:58.525 --> 47:01.737
Yeah or yes?

47:01.820 --> 47:03.780
Fine, but come in your Sunday
best, okay?

47:03.863 --> 47:05.990
Do I have to shampoo my hair,
too?

47:06.073 --> 47:08.868
Ha-ha, ha-ha, very funny.

47:08.952 --> 47:09.870
Stop being a smart ass,

47:09.953 --> 47:11.372
or else I'll cancel
the whole thing.

47:28.347 --> 47:29.598
Maggie?

47:46.615 --> 47:47.448
Hi, baby.

47:49.367 --> 47:50.618
I have a surprise for you.

47:50.702 --> 47:52.412
Really?

47:52.495 --> 47:53.497
Mhmm.

47:53.580 --> 47:55.873
Oh, come on. Tell me.

47:59.837 --> 48:02.338
I got a job!

48:02.422 --> 48:03.798
AIDEN:
At Elijah's magazine!

48:03.882 --> 48:05.925
I met with him earlier today.

48:06.008 --> 48:07.802
But you already have a job.

48:07.885 --> 48:08.845
Where?

48:13.267 --> 48:16.895
Maggie,
I can't be an intern forever.

48:20.940 --> 48:23.693
This is a really big
opportunity for me.

48:23.777 --> 48:25.237
MAGGIE:
So, you're leaving me?

48:26.028 --> 48:30.367
No, I'm not leaving you.

48:30.450 --> 48:32.910
I thought you'd be happy.

48:32.995 --> 48:34.245
Aren't you happy?

48:38.000 --> 48:39.083
Let's celebrate.

48:39.167 --> 48:41.795
I picked up dinner.
Grab the wine?

48:41.878 --> 48:43.297
Okay, give me a minute.

48:58.520 --> 49:01.523
I've been saving this bottle
for a special occasion.

49:41.480 --> 49:43.398
To the future.

49:43.482 --> 49:44.107
The future.

50:10.717 --> 50:12.677
POLICE OFFICER 1:
Hands in the air!
Let me see your hands!

50:27.150 --> 50:29.277
POLICE OFFICER 2:
Looks like we need ambulance,
ASAP.

52:10.337 --> 52:12.088
I don't know what to say...

52:15.842 --> 52:19.637
...but you better not forget
the 100 metre mark.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.973
Violate that
and you'll be in for good.

52:25.685 --> 52:30.898
The anger management thingy
will be alright, I guess.

52:42.702 --> 52:45.538
You better be careful,
the probation period.

52:52.837 --> 52:55.590
Look, Father Paul,

52:55.673 --> 52:56.967
I hear you.

52:57.050 --> 53:01.847
But what are you supposed to do
when a bitch talks back? Hmm?

53:01.930 --> 53:04.223
I wouldn't tolerate
no disrespect.

53:04.307 --> 53:05.725
Disrespect, eh?

53:05.808 --> 53:07.727
Tell us what happened, Douglas.

53:07.810 --> 53:09.520
I-- I told the bitch
to get me a beer.

53:09.603 --> 53:10.397
And that's what you said?

53:10.480 --> 53:12.565
Yeah!

53:12.648 --> 53:13.483
Mostly.

53:14.775 --> 53:16.027
Okay.

53:16.110 --> 53:18.738
Actually, I what I said was,
"Bitch, you fetch me that beer

53:18.822 --> 53:19.613
from that fridge

53:19.697 --> 53:21.658
or I'm gonna smash
your face in."

53:21.742 --> 53:23.577
And did she get it for you?

53:23.660 --> 53:24.618
Well, yeah.

53:24.702 --> 53:26.537
But that shit was fuckin' warm.

53:26.622 --> 53:28.623
And you can't drink
no warm beer!

53:29.498 --> 53:32.418
So, I smashed it on her face!

53:32.502 --> 53:34.003
And you think what you did
was right?

53:36.547 --> 53:38.300
Yeah, yeah.

53:40.302 --> 53:42.303
Think about it and we'll talk
about it more next week.

53:43.638 --> 53:46.057
Now, before we run out of time,

53:46.140 --> 53:47.892
I'd like you all
to welcome Aiden.

53:47.975 --> 53:48.810
-DOUGLAS: Hey.
-Hi Aiden.

53:48.893 --> 53:49.937
DOUGLAS:
Hi.

53:50.020 --> 53:51.228
It's his first session.

53:51.312 --> 53:54.398
So we're gonna start about
talking about why he's here.

53:54.482 --> 53:55.567
Go ahead, Aiden.

53:55.650 --> 53:56.902
Oh, no, no.

53:56.985 --> 53:58.987
I don't belong here.

53:59.070 --> 54:00.280
I'm sure you feel that way.

54:00.363 --> 54:03.240
No, you don't understand.

54:03.325 --> 54:06.535
I didn't do it.
This is all a mistake.

54:06.620 --> 54:07.703
It wasn't me.

54:07.787 --> 54:10.207
It was this other guy,
he stalked her, it was him!

54:10.290 --> 54:12.042
I was passed out
in the other room.

54:12.125 --> 54:15.253
Aiden, the first step
to recovery is admitting

54:15.337 --> 54:16.462
you have a problem.

54:16.545 --> 54:18.255
You're not listening to me!

54:18.340 --> 54:19.967
I would never hurt her!

54:20.050 --> 54:21.092
I love her.

54:21.175 --> 54:22.218
It was Daniel.

54:22.302 --> 54:25.055
He-- he stalked her,
he threatened her

54:25.138 --> 54:26.388
He broke into her house.

54:26.472 --> 54:27.640
Aiden.

54:27.723 --> 54:31.518
We’re not here to judge you,
or anyone for that matter.

54:31.602 --> 54:34.730
We’re here to help you
overcome your anger

54:34.813 --> 54:36.357
The anger you carry
inside you--

54:36.440 --> 54:39.987
I have no anger inside me!

54:40.070 --> 54:40.778
It wasn't me!

54:40.862 --> 54:41.487
I--

54:45.158 --> 54:47.785
Aiden, that’s not how you deal
with your anger.

54:47.868 --> 54:48.912
You don't understand.

54:48.995 --> 54:50.580
I didn't do it!

55:18.023 --> 55:20.235
Hello?

55:20.318 --> 55:22.070
Hello?

55:22.153 --> 55:23.363
Who is this?

55:26.742 --> 55:28.242
Maggie?

55:28.325 --> 55:29.535
Maggie, is that you?

55:31.620 --> 55:32.955
But Maggie, how--

55:58.648 --> 56:01.943
Maggie? Maggie?

56:02.027 --> 56:03.318
Maggie, are you okay?

56:03.403 --> 56:05.322
Where are you, baby?

56:08.658 --> 56:10.077
Baby, baby, I don't know
what's going on.

56:10.160 --> 56:11.452
They think that I hurt you.

56:15.998 --> 56:17.458
Baby, where are you?

56:26.133 --> 56:27.593
Call the police!

56:32.723 --> 56:35.810
Baby, call the police!

56:43.860 --> 56:45.820
Baby, I-- I can't.

56:45.903 --> 56:47.488
I'm not allowed to be near you.

56:55.288 --> 56:58.207
Baby no, I can't it's-

56:59.667 --> 57:00.543
Fuck!

57:13.473 --> 57:14.348
Maggie.

57:14.432 --> 57:16.058
POLICE OFFICER 3:
Hey.

57:16.142 --> 57:17.143
You are not supposed
to be here.

57:17.227 --> 57:17.935
No, no, no, no.

57:18.018 --> 57:18.978
She called me, she called me.

57:19.062 --> 57:20.103
She needs my help.

57:20.188 --> 57:22.190
POLICE OFFICER 2:
That's it. Stop where you are!

57:22.273 --> 57:23.190
Hands behind--

57:23.273 --> 57:25.652
Put your hands on the car!

57:25.735 --> 57:27.195
Maggie, what's going on?

57:30.198 --> 57:31.950
-Maggie, tell them!
-POLICE OFFICER 2: Come on!

57:46.755 --> 57:47.673
Aiden.

58:02.188 --> 58:06.192
What the hell were you
thinking, man.

58:06.275 --> 58:09.278
Really screwed yourself now.

58:09.362 --> 58:12.365
Two criminal convictions
on your record.

58:12.448 --> 58:15.702
You know what that means?

58:15.785 --> 58:18.078
You're not even listening
to me.

58:18.162 --> 58:20.038
“I told you so.”

58:20.122 --> 58:21.917
What?

58:22.000 --> 58:28.590
I said it, so you don't have
to, “I told you so”.

58:37.265 --> 58:41.435
Go on, get out of here.

58:41.518 --> 58:43.897
Go on!

59:47.377 --> 59:48.628
Aiden?

1:00:05.102 --> 1:00:07.688
You okay?

1:00:09.523 --> 1:00:11.733
Is everything alright?

1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:16.697
They had security
escort me out of the building.

1:00:16.780 --> 1:00:18.783
Oh shit.

1:00:32.838 --> 1:00:33.965
SELVA:
What are you gonna do?

1:00:38.427 --> 1:00:39.803
I don't know.

1:01:19.093 --> 1:01:20.428
-Hi there.
-Hi.

1:01:20.512 --> 1:01:21.553
My name's Aiden,

1:01:21.637 --> 1:01:23.680
I'm just dropping off my résumé
and portfolio.

1:01:23.765 --> 1:01:24.682
Oh, okay.

1:01:24.765 --> 1:01:27.143
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

1:01:27.227 --> 1:01:29.978
So, I'm also gonna need
a police check.

1:01:30.062 --> 1:01:31.897
-A police check?
-Yeah.

1:01:31.980 --> 1:01:32.857
Okay.

1:01:32.940 --> 1:01:36.318
Um, I will-
I'll be back with that.

1:01:36.402 --> 1:01:37.278
Okay.

1:01:37.362 --> 1:01:41.448
Oh, a police report?

1:01:41.532 --> 1:01:42.367
Sure.

1:01:42.450 --> 1:01:44.993
Uh, you didn't get police
clearance?

1:01:48.122 --> 1:01:49.540
Okay. Yep.

1:01:50.958 --> 1:01:53.377
Yeah, I’ll-- I’ll--
I'll get that to you.

1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:54.837
Yep, yep, yep. Okay, bye.

1:01:54.920 --> 1:01:55.547
Fuck!

1:01:56.213 --> 1:01:58.800
MICHAEL:
What is this, Maggie?

1:01:58.883 --> 1:02:00.468
It's boring!

1:02:00.552 --> 1:02:02.262
Punch it up,
make it interesting.

1:02:02.345 --> 1:02:05.055
Add something!

1:02:05.138 --> 1:02:07.183
-I thought that--
-Do you need more time?

1:02:07.267 --> 1:02:08.893
No, it'll be fine.

1:02:11.603 --> 1:02:13.105
You're slipping, Maggie.

1:02:21.947 --> 1:02:24.783
Eh, hello?

1:02:24.867 --> 1:02:26.077
Yeah, yeah, this is Aiden.

1:02:31.082 --> 1:02:34.293
Oh, you didn't get
police clearance?

1:02:36.587 --> 1:02:38.672
So-- so I-- I didn't get
the position?

1:02:42.843 --> 1:02:44.512
Yep, yep.
Bye.

1:02:51.685 --> 1:02:52.895
Fuck!

1:03:00.778 --> 1:03:02.197
Hey!

1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:03.280
Hi!

1:03:03.363 --> 1:03:04.365
I was just about to call you.

1:03:04.448 --> 1:03:05.533
I thought you'd forgotten.

1:03:05.617 --> 1:03:07.785
Oh, I'd rather be dead,
than miss a date with you.

1:03:09.078 --> 1:03:12.457
Hey, were you serious before
about leaving?

1:03:15.250 --> 1:03:18.378
Yeah, I-- I think it might be
for the best.

1:03:18.462 --> 1:03:19.713
Rozenberg is hiring.

1:03:19.797 --> 1:03:20.422
DANIEL:
Oh yeah?

1:03:20.507 --> 1:03:21.757
Heard it on the grapevine.

1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:25.427
That's good, I'll uh,
I'll take a look into it.

1:03:25.512 --> 1:03:28.097
God, with you gone,

1:03:28.180 --> 1:03:30.223
the office is gonna be
so different.

1:03:30.307 --> 1:03:31.558
I mean, as it is,
there's already

1:03:31.642 --> 1:03:32.768
so many new faces.

1:03:32.852 --> 1:03:34.895
And Aiden...

1:03:34.978 --> 1:03:37.982
no one's seen or even heard
from him in so long.

1:03:41.902 --> 1:03:43.612
Do you really think
he assaulted her?

1:03:45.447 --> 1:03:48.200
He assaulted me,
that's for sure.

1:03:48.283 --> 1:03:51.703
And Maggie, I mean she--

1:03:51.787 --> 1:03:53.580
Maggie, what?

1:03:55.498 --> 1:03:57.918
Nothing, nothing.

1:03:58.002 --> 1:04:01.005
Come on, we're gonna be late
for our reservation.

1:04:03.798 --> 1:04:05.718
We understand.

1:04:06.718 --> 1:04:07.928
What do you think, Horace?

1:04:08.012 --> 1:04:09.805
You think Jason could have
handled it differently?

1:04:13.142 --> 1:04:14.893
That anger's no good man.

1:04:14.977 --> 1:04:17.605
It gets you in some deep shit.

1:04:17.688 --> 1:04:18.898
That's good.

1:04:18.982 --> 1:04:20.065
I'm glad we all agree.

1:04:23.818 --> 1:04:26.155
Let's hear Aiden's story.

1:04:26.238 --> 1:04:27.907
Aiden, tell us your story.

1:04:29.492 --> 1:04:30.993
You wanna hear my story?

1:04:33.037 --> 1:04:34.288
My life is fucking gone!

1:04:34.372 --> 1:04:35.497
It's fucking--

1:04:37.292 --> 1:04:39.835
Because of that crazy bitch
and that bastard!

1:04:39.918 --> 1:04:41.712
They set me up!

1:04:41.795 --> 1:04:43.797
Please calm down.

1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:46.717
They made a piece of shit
out of me!

1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:48.260
Those fuckers!

1:04:48.343 --> 1:04:50.262
Okay.

1:04:50.345 --> 1:04:53.557
Change of plans.

1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:56.602
We’re gonna do some
breathing exercises.

1:04:56.685 --> 1:04:58.312
Jesse, can you start
the session?

1:04:58.395 --> 1:05:00.188
Sure.

1:05:00.272 --> 1:05:03.943
You wanna breath in...

1:05:04.027 --> 1:05:05.068
...And out.

1:05:49.530 --> 1:05:51.198
Honey.

1:05:51.282 --> 1:05:54.618
What?

1:05:54.702 --> 1:05:56.620
What?

1:05:56.703 --> 1:05:58.747
You have to talk to Aiden.

1:05:58.830 --> 1:06:01.333
About what?

1:06:01.417 --> 1:06:04.212
Seriously?
You haven't noticed, huh?

1:06:07.088 --> 1:06:09.967
He looks like scum.

1:06:10.050 --> 1:06:13.470
I don't know where he goes
or when he goes,

1:06:13.553 --> 1:06:16.098
what he does.

1:06:16.182 --> 1:06:18.767
Around the house he's always
swearing, and cursing,

1:06:18.850 --> 1:06:21.687
and drinking.

1:06:21.770 --> 1:06:24.482
And what am I supposed to do?

1:06:24.565 --> 1:06:27.025
Curse back?

1:06:27.108 --> 1:06:28.568
Selva, stop it.

1:06:30.905 --> 1:06:34.325
What are people gonna think?

1:06:34.408 --> 1:06:37.118
We can't have him like this.

1:06:37.202 --> 1:06:38.787
This has got to stop!

1:06:43.208 --> 1:06:46.045
If you don't say something,
I will!

1:06:48.505 --> 1:06:49.882
Aiden?

1:06:58.307 --> 1:06:59.975
Hey man!

1:07:00.058 --> 1:07:02.562
She didn't mean it, okay?

1:07:02.645 --> 1:07:04.647
Look, hey, hey--

1:07:04.730 --> 1:07:06.107
Hey!

1:07:06.190 --> 1:07:07.858
Let's go home,
have some supper.

1:07:07.942 --> 1:07:09.235
Get a good night's sleep

1:07:09.318 --> 1:07:11.237
and we'll figure all this out.

1:07:11.320 --> 1:07:12.405
-No!
-Come on.

1:07:12.488 --> 1:07:13.488
AIDEN:
No!

1:07:13.572 --> 1:07:16.492
Come on, Aiden.

1:07:16.575 --> 1:07:18.160
Don't do this, man!

1:08:24.017 --> 1:08:26.728
You wanted to see me?

1:08:26.812 --> 1:08:28.438
Yeah, have a seat.

1:08:32.985 --> 1:08:37.447
I just got a call
from Zelia's publicist.

1:08:37.532 --> 1:08:38.740
She's not happy.

1:08:40.742 --> 1:08:41.618
Oh.

1:08:41.702 --> 1:08:43.328
This cannot happen, Maggie.

1:08:46.332 --> 1:08:48.917
Now she wants to vet
every article

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.587
before we go to print.

1:08:51.670 --> 1:08:52.420
Okay.

1:08:52.505 --> 1:08:55.090
No, not okay.

1:08:55.173 --> 1:08:57.677
Now I have to move
your deadlines up by two days.

1:08:57.760 --> 1:08:59.428
Is that gonna be a problem
for you?

1:08:59.512 --> 1:09:00.762
No.

1:09:00.847 --> 1:09:04.350
The reputation of our magazine
is at stake, Maggie.

1:09:04.433 --> 1:09:07.477
I need you to do whatever
is required

1:09:07.562 --> 1:09:09.313
to win her back.

1:09:09.397 --> 1:09:12.232
-Do you understand?
-Yeah, I will.

1:09:52.815 --> 1:09:53.857
Aiden?

1:09:55.902 --> 1:09:58.862
Aiden.

1:09:58.945 --> 1:10:01.615
Aiden.
Please don't be dead.

1:10:03.992 --> 1:10:07.453
Oh, thank God, you’re alive!

1:10:07.537 --> 1:10:11.208
Aiden, it's me Sophia.

1:10:11.292 --> 1:10:13.002
Go away!

1:10:13.085 --> 1:10:15.545
Aiden, you're gonna freeze
to death out here!

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:22.928
It was her, wasn't it?
Maggie?

1:10:23.012 --> 1:10:24.763
She messed you up, right?

1:10:27.432 --> 1:10:28.267
Aiden, come on.

1:10:28.350 --> 1:10:30.102
It's going to start
snowing soon.

1:10:30.185 --> 1:10:31.353
You're gonna die out here.

1:10:31.437 --> 1:10:34.022
Just--
come with me to my place, okay?

1:10:34.105 --> 1:10:35.232
Let's go, come on.

1:10:35.315 --> 1:10:36.358
AIDEN:
Go away.

1:10:36.442 --> 1:10:38.902
Aiden, please,
I can't just leave you he

1:10:38.985 --> 1:10:40.153
and walk away.

1:10:43.157 --> 1:10:44.325
Okay.

1:10:44.408 --> 1:10:45.575
If you're not gonna
come with me,

1:10:45.658 --> 1:10:48.620
then I'm just gonna sit with you
even if I freeze to death.

1:10:50.622 --> 1:10:53.458
Okay, I’m just gonna
just make room here.

1:10:59.548 --> 1:11:01.508
There we go, let's go.

1:11:01.592 --> 1:11:02.635
Oh, you're okay, you're okay.

1:11:02.718 --> 1:11:04.387
Come on.

1:11:04.470 --> 1:11:05.220
I got you.

1:11:09.808 --> 1:11:10.892
What do you want from me?

1:11:10.977 --> 1:11:12.895
Just-- just come to my place, okay.

1:11:12.978 --> 1:11:14.980
No, why?

1:11:15.063 --> 1:11:16.690
Because I can help you!

1:11:16.773 --> 1:11:19.318
And I can't leave you here
like this.

1:11:22.403 --> 1:11:23.405
SOPHIA:
Come on, just...

1:11:34.082 --> 1:11:35.125
SOPHIA:
Just a minute!

1:11:40.547 --> 1:11:42.675
Yes?

1:11:42.758 --> 1:11:45.010
Can--
Can I come in?

1:11:45.093 --> 1:11:46.512
No.

1:11:48.263 --> 1:11:51.600
You're gonna make me do this
out here in the hallway?

1:11:51.683 --> 1:11:54.018
Yes.

1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:02.903
Fine, fine, um,
I'm so sorry about before.

1:12:02.987 --> 1:12:06.073
You were right,
I-- I was wrong.

1:12:06.157 --> 1:12:09.117
I shouldn't have--
I shouldn’t have done--

1:12:11.203 --> 1:12:12.705
What-- what--
what is that smell?

1:12:14.540 --> 1:12:15.707
DANIEL:
Is there--
is there someone here?

1:12:15.790 --> 1:12:18.543
Sophia, isn't this Mag--

1:12:18.627 --> 1:12:19.878
You! You!

1:12:19.962 --> 1:12:20.795
What-- what are you doing here?

1:12:20.878 --> 1:12:21.588
What am I doing here?

1:12:21.672 --> 1:12:22.757
AIDEN:
What is he doing here?

1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:24.592
What is he-- what is he doing here? Why is he here?

1:12:24.675 --> 1:12:25.883
And why is he in your bathrobe?

1:12:25.967 --> 1:12:26.802
Okay.

1:12:26.885 --> 1:12:28.595
Who's gonna call the cops now,
huh?

1:12:29.972 --> 1:12:32.557
Both of you, stop it, now!

1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:34.893
You, go sit over there!

1:12:34.977 --> 1:12:36.437
What's happening here?

1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:38.188
Go put this on.

1:12:38.272 --> 1:12:39.355
And then when you come back,

1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:43.318
we're gonna sit and talk like
adults, understood?

1:12:43.402 --> 1:12:44.778
Now!

1:13:04.882 --> 1:13:06.467
Are you crazy?

1:13:06.550 --> 1:13:08.927
I thought you came here
to apologize.

1:13:09.010 --> 1:13:10.720
Don't change the subject!

1:13:10.803 --> 1:13:12.055
He is dangerous!

1:13:12.138 --> 1:13:14.725
Why would you let him
in your apartment?

1:13:14.808 --> 1:13:17.477
He was lying on the street,
all filthy, and disgusting,

1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:18.728
and pathetic.

1:13:18.812 --> 1:13:20.730
We used to know him, Daniel.

1:13:20.813 --> 1:13:22.315
I can't just leave him there.

1:13:27.362 --> 1:13:29.448
You should eat something.

1:13:36.330 --> 1:13:38.332
Okay, go ahead.

1:13:40.375 --> 1:13:42.752
Daniel.

1:13:42.837 --> 1:13:45.255
-Daniel?
-What?

1:13:45.338 --> 1:13:47.673
You said you came here
to apologize, go ahead.

1:13:49.092 --> 1:13:50.885
-In front of him?
-Daniel!

1:14:00.770 --> 1:14:03.732
Fine, fine.

1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:13.408
I-- I came here because...

1:14:16.870 --> 1:14:18.788
I-- I wanted--

1:14:21.250 --> 1:14:23.918
...what-- seriously, Sophia?

1:14:24.002 --> 1:14:25.212
Why would you let him
in your apartment?

1:14:25.295 --> 1:14:26.463
Daniel!

1:14:26.547 --> 1:14:27.630
He assaulted her.

1:14:27.713 --> 1:14:29.048
I didn't assault her!

1:14:29.132 --> 1:14:31.385
Yeah? And I guess you didn't
punch me in the bar either?

1:14:31.468 --> 1:14:33.470
No. That I did.

1:14:33.553 --> 1:14:34.722
But, you stalked her...

1:14:34.805 --> 1:14:35.847
...and you broke into her house!

1:14:35.930 --> 1:14:36.890
I didn't break into her house!

1:14:36.973 --> 1:14:38.142
I don't even know
where she lives!

1:14:38.225 --> 1:14:39.433
I was there.

1:14:39.518 --> 1:14:41.187
-You ran away when you saw me!
-What are you talking about?

1:14:41.270 --> 1:14:42.562
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

1:14:42.645 --> 1:14:44.397
Sit down!

1:14:45.315 --> 1:14:47.567
You actually saw him?

1:15:01.038 --> 1:15:02.875
None of this makes sense.

1:15:05.002 --> 1:15:07.837
Just tell us exactly
what happened

1:15:07.922 --> 1:15:09.255
on the night of the assault.

1:15:13.052 --> 1:15:15.053
I didn't do it.

1:15:18.223 --> 1:15:19.725
But-

1:15:22.310 --> 1:15:24.478
I can't remember, it's a blur.

1:15:24.563 --> 1:15:26.565
Yeah, well,
why don't you try to remember.

1:15:31.903 --> 1:15:32.737
Okay.

1:15:37.075 --> 1:15:38.577
After our meeting with Elijah,

1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:40.703
I picked up dinner
and then went home.

1:15:41.747 --> 1:15:45.542
Maggie was really surprised
to hear about my new job.

1:15:45.625 --> 1:15:47.085
Wait.

1:15:47.168 --> 1:15:49.087
She didn't know about it
before?

1:15:49.170 --> 1:15:51.088
No.

1:15:55.593 --> 1:15:58.472
And then we celebrated
with dinner and wine.

1:16:00.598 --> 1:16:03.060
Something else had to have
happened that night.

1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:06.813
DANIEL:
Yeah.

1:16:06.897 --> 1:16:08.482
And we need to figure it out.

1:16:16.072 --> 1:16:18.408
I don't know,
if this is gonna work.

1:16:19.158 --> 1:16:21.870
I hope this works.

1:16:21.953 --> 1:16:25.915
Baby, you know this is
our only chance!

1:16:25.998 --> 1:16:29.377
You have to do this
for all of us.

1:16:34.842 --> 1:16:36.677
Okay.

1:16:37.343 --> 1:16:38.553
No more punches.

1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:52.858
You!

1:16:52.942 --> 1:16:54.737
Expecting someone else?

1:16:56.530 --> 1:16:59.992
Aiden, maybe?

1:17:02.243 --> 1:17:05.663
You know, I don't think
I've seen you look so messy.

1:17:07.832 --> 1:17:09.083
Such a shame.

1:17:12.087 --> 1:17:13.838
But he got to you, didn't he?

1:17:13.922 --> 1:17:15.465
What the hell
are you talking about?

1:17:15.548 --> 1:17:18.260
You know what I mean.

1:17:18.343 --> 1:17:20.928
Somewhere along the way

1:17:21.012 --> 1:17:22.430
you made a mistake.

1:17:22.513 --> 1:17:24.515
I don't make mistakes.

1:17:24.598 --> 1:17:27.102
Oh.

1:17:27.185 --> 1:17:28.562
Touchy, eh?

1:17:30.522 --> 1:17:32.315
Oh, I see.

1:17:33.817 --> 1:17:36.318
The proverbial pupil,

1:17:36.403 --> 1:17:40.532
who outdid the master!

1:17:40.615 --> 1:17:42.242
That's why you lost control
over him.

1:17:42.325 --> 1:17:44.035
I didn't lose control.

1:17:46.413 --> 1:17:48.248
But he stopped following
your plan!

1:17:48.332 --> 1:17:49.623
He betrayed me!

1:17:49.708 --> 1:17:52.085
After everything I did for him

1:17:52.168 --> 1:17:54.128
and he hid things from me!

1:17:54.212 --> 1:17:58.007
You used everyone
to climb the ladder.

1:17:58.092 --> 1:18:00.552
Robert, Aiden, me.

1:18:00.635 --> 1:18:02.678
Oh, please.

1:18:02.762 --> 1:18:04.555
How is that new secretary
of yours?

1:18:04.638 --> 1:18:06.057
Still useful?

1:18:06.140 --> 1:18:09.143
Oh God.

1:18:13.607 --> 1:18:15.733
You fell in love with him,
didn't you?

1:18:19.738 --> 1:18:21.948
Oh my God!

1:18:22.032 --> 1:18:24.075
You fell in love with him!

1:18:24.158 --> 1:18:25.743
He got to you.

1:18:25.827 --> 1:18:28.830
She made you question yourself.

1:18:28.913 --> 1:18:31.248
So, you utterly ruined him

1:18:31.332 --> 1:18:33.210
and made him question
his own sanity.

1:18:33.293 --> 1:18:35.170
That bastard!

1:18:35.253 --> 1:18:36.170
He pretended to be different

1:18:36.253 --> 1:18:39.048
but then,
he was just like-- like a snake!

1:18:39.132 --> 1:18:40.342
A snake in the grass!

1:18:40.425 --> 1:18:41.175
And I had no choice!

1:18:41.258 --> 1:18:42.718
You see, I had no choice!

1:19:22.133 --> 1:19:25.053
I've been saving this bottle
for a special occasion.

1:19:57.168 --> 1:19:59.253
To the future.

1:19:59.337 --> 1:19:59.880
Future.

1:21:01.023 --> 1:21:02.025
Help me, help me!

1:21:02.108 --> 1:21:03.860
He's gonna kill me

1:21:45.443 --> 1:21:46.695
En plein air!

1:21:46.778 --> 1:21:49.030
Did you ever notice that
when we eat outside

1:21:49.113 --> 1:21:51.282
it’s an Italian dining,
al fresco.

1:21:51.365 --> 1:21:53.618
And when we paint outside,
it's in French.

1:21:53.702 --> 1:21:54.577
En plein air!

1:21:57.580 --> 1:21:58.748
What's wrong?

1:22:01.583 --> 1:22:03.420
There's something
you need to watch.

1:22:22.522 --> 1:22:23.607
Michael.

1:22:29.153 --> 1:22:30.905
You're firing me?

1:22:30.988 --> 1:22:32.823
MICHAEL:
Security will show you out.

1:22:34.242 --> 1:22:35.827
Goodbye, Maggie.

1:23:09.068 --> 1:23:12.113
Honestly, yours was the most
eventful internship,

1:23:12.197 --> 1:23:13.155
I've ever heard of.

1:23:16.117 --> 1:23:18.285
What would you say joining us
as an editor?

1:23:18.370 --> 1:23:19.620
As an editor?

1:23:24.167 --> 1:23:27.253
But what about
my criminal conviction?

1:23:27.337 --> 1:23:28.672
Don't worry about that.

1:23:28.755 --> 1:23:30.590
The law might believe
you're a criminal.

1:23:30.673 --> 1:23:31.967
I know you're not.

1:23:33.802 --> 1:23:35.887
Wow, Michael, thank you!

1:23:35.970 --> 1:23:37.097
Thank you, I--

1:23:37.180 --> 1:23:38.347
Welcome to the team!

1:23:39.765 --> 1:23:40.558
Oh!

1:23:40.642 --> 1:23:42.310
And Aiden,
you will be moving out

1:23:42.393 --> 1:23:44.270
of my niece's apartment,
right?

1:23:44.353 --> 1:23:46.898
First thing tomorrow,
I promise.

1:23:54.113 --> 1:23:55.532
I think this is it.

1:23:55.615 --> 1:23:57.908
But maybe take one more
look around, just in case.

1:24:02.538 --> 1:24:05.125
Sophia?

1:24:05.208 --> 1:24:07.752
I always wanted to ask you.

1:24:12.632 --> 1:24:14.633
Um, why do you have a picture
of Maggie?

1:24:14.717 --> 1:24:18.472
Maggie happened to stop by
the day my dad took that photo.

1:24:18.555 --> 1:24:20.307
And it's last photo of my Fish.

1:24:25.770 --> 1:24:27.438
Fish was your dog?

1:24:27.522 --> 1:24:29.898
Yeah, why?

1:24:37.490 --> 1:24:40.827
So, her dad...

1:24:40.910 --> 1:24:42.287
...was he a drunk?

1:24:43.328 --> 1:24:45.290
Did he run out on them?

1:24:45.373 --> 1:24:47.542
Her father...

1:24:49.543 --> 1:24:52.047
...her father killed himself.

1:24:52.130 --> 1:24:54.965
After he beat her mother
to death with a baseball bat.

1:25:13.233 --> 1:25:16.153
Come here, you.

1:25:18.490 --> 1:25:22.327
You ever do anything like that
again and I'll, I'll--

1:25:23.620 --> 1:25:25.163
I'm sorry

1:25:33.755 --> 1:25:35.548
Are you crying?

1:25:35.632 --> 1:25:38.175
No, allergies.

1:25:40.428 --> 1:25:44.015
You're paying for the drinks
the next 10 times we go out!

1:25:44.098 --> 1:25:45.558
It's on me.

1:25:45.642 --> 1:25:46.977
Honey, who is it?

1:25:48.937 --> 1:25:51.355
Aiden?

1:25:51.438 --> 1:25:52.607
Aiden!

1:25:55.485 --> 1:25:57.653
Let him in, he looks hungry.

1:25:57.737 --> 1:26:00.448
Of course, steamed chicken.

1:26:00.532 --> 1:26:02.033
I-- you must be starving.

1:27:11.852 --> 1:27:13.478
Maggie, what are you doing?

1:27:13.562 --> 1:27:14.188
Maggie, stop!

1:27:14.272 --> 1:27:15.440
You can't go in there!

1:27:16.942 --> 1:27:17.983
Hello?

1:27:18.067 --> 1:27:19.068
Security?

1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:21.028
AIDEN:
Okay.

1:27:21.112 --> 1:27:22.197
So last month was really good.

1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:24.865
Subscriptions are up
by almost 10%.

1:27:24.948 --> 1:27:28.243
Uh, that being said,
let's keep it going.

1:27:28.327 --> 1:27:29.370
Next month we're gonna feature
the--

1:27:29.453 --> 1:27:31.080
Stop! Get away from-- hey!
