WEBVTT

00:06.592 --> 00:07.780
Ahem!

00:08.170 --> 00:11.754
I don't want to tattle
on my good friend, Tirek,

00:11.842 --> 00:15.998
but you might like to know
he left food out. Again.

00:16.091 --> 00:18.303
I'll deal with it when I'm done.

00:20.709 --> 00:25.002
Don't trust anything that
nosy little Pegasus says.

00:25.155 --> 00:27.920
I don't trust anything
any of you say.

00:30.819 --> 00:32.978
Are you planning on
attacking anypony

00:33.065 --> 00:35.559
anytime soon?
If not, I don't know why

00:35.647 --> 00:39.647
I'm wasting my time here.
I am a queen, you know!

00:41.670 --> 00:45.067
I am leaving, since it's
impossible to accomplish

00:45.155 --> 00:46.670
the work I need to do here!

00:46.881 --> 00:50.408
I suggest the three of you
come to some kind of accord.

00:53.652 --> 00:58.203
I don't care how, but you
must learn to work together.

00:58.290 --> 01:01.908
Only then can we accomplish
what you so greatly desire:

01:01.996 --> 01:06.263
the defeat of Twilight
Sparkle and her friends!

01:51.814 --> 01:55.794
Nothing says teamwork like
an inspirational banner!

01:55.881 --> 01:57.749
When Grogar sees this,

01:57.837 --> 02:00.732
he'll realize there's no way
he could survive without me!

02:05.470 --> 02:07.249
You're gonna have
to exercise a lot

02:07.337 --> 02:08.241
to get as big as you were

02:08.330 --> 02:10.608
when you absorbed the life
force of all those ponies.

02:11.793 --> 02:14.378
Anyhoo... Grogar wants
us all to work together

02:14.466 --> 02:16.748
so I've scheduled
a team meeting!

02:17.119 --> 02:19.298
Doesn't that sound fun?

02:20.353 --> 02:23.296
And since Grogar
left me in charge.

02:23.384 --> 02:24.422
No, he didn't.

02:25.544 --> 02:28.660
Someone's a real
grumpy-taur today.

02:28.976 --> 02:31.560
If we aren't meeting, I
guess I could just stay

02:31.648 --> 02:33.677
and offer positive
and inspiring...

02:33.765 --> 02:37.082
Fine! I'll join your
meeting. Just leave.

02:37.170 --> 02:38.670
See you soon!

02:40.225 --> 02:43.208
It's been weeks and
Grogar has done nothing!

02:43.295 --> 02:46.539
It's not healthy to hold
onto all of this rage.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.742
I could lash out at any moment.

02:49.015 --> 02:50.951
And how are you
doing this fine...

02:51.039 --> 02:52.545
How do you think I'm doing?

02:52.633 --> 02:55.037
I'm ready to exact my revenge!

02:55.125 --> 02:56.454
See what I mean?

02:56.648 --> 02:59.513
Being cooped up with
nothing to do is the worst.

02:59.601 --> 03:02.537
You know what you
need? A team meeting!

03:02.625 --> 03:04.726
I don't do meetings.

03:04.814 --> 03:06.741
Grogar left me in charge.

03:06.829 --> 03:11.640
No, he didn't. And even if he
did, Chrysalis obeys no one.

03:11.728 --> 03:13.492
There'll be cupcakes.

03:15.770 --> 03:17.701
Grogar wants us to work together

03:17.789 --> 03:18.821
to defeat our enemies.

03:18.908 --> 03:22.609
Which means we need
to trust each other.

03:22.697 --> 03:24.992
If we are to trust one another,

03:25.080 --> 03:27.414
perhaps inform Lord Tirek...

03:27.502 --> 03:30.131
to stop trying to
absorb my essence.

03:31.814 --> 03:36.798
I wasn't doing anything
of the sort. How dare you?

03:36.886 --> 03:40.943
How dare I? Do you know
to whom you are speaking?

03:42.884 --> 03:46.554
How could I not! You tell
your log every five minutes!

03:46.742 --> 03:49.065
This is why Grogar
left me in charge.

03:49.238 --> 03:51.984

Hey! You stepped on my cue!

06:27.736 --> 06:29.651
Well, I did not!
Your rhythm was way off.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.768
ENOUGH!

06:34.883 --> 06:35.952
I had hoped by now

06:36.039 --> 06:37.859
you would have resolved
your differences.

06:37.947 --> 06:39.895
But apparently not.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.782
Perhaps if we knew
what the plan was,

06:42.908 --> 06:45.357
we would be better
able to prepare.

06:45.514 --> 06:47.875
Assuming you even have a plan.

06:47.963 --> 06:50.492
Of course, I have a plan.

06:50.580 --> 06:52.703
I have located
an object of power

06:52.791 --> 06:55.707
and it occurs to me this
is the perfect test.

06:55.795 --> 06:58.648
The three of you will work
together to retrieve it.

06:58.925 --> 07:04.390
Against this item, those
ponies won't stand a chance.

07:04.736 --> 07:09.125
I have come close to ruling
Equestria several times.

07:09.297 --> 07:11.273
Perhaps I should be
the one to lead us.

07:11.405 --> 07:14.023
I nearly drained all the
magic from Equestria!

07:14.111 --> 07:15.351
That was good!

07:15.439 --> 07:19.734
I absorbed all the
magic of Equestria!

07:19.822 --> 07:23.906
I could feel it flowing
through my body as I grew.

07:29.594 --> 07:31.638
Each of you failed to defeat

07:31.726 --> 07:34.265
Twilight Sparkle
and her friends.

07:34.928 --> 07:38.345
My power is greater than
all of yours combined.

07:38.432 --> 07:41.640
This is but a fraction
of it. Understood?

07:41.823 --> 07:43.844
Uh huh. OK!

07:45.416 --> 07:48.832
Now you shall retrieve
the rest of it.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.172
<i>Thousands of moons ago,</i>

07:55.260 --> 07:58.198
<i>the self-righteous
Gusty the Great,</i>

07:58.286 --> 08:00.804
<i>unable to best me
face-to-face,</i>

08:00.892 --> 08:03.140
<i>stole my bewitching bell,</i>

08:03.228 --> 08:06.396
<i>a talisman containing</i>
much of my own magic.

08:06.484 --> 08:08.922
<i>The bell cannot be destroyed</i>

08:09.010 --> 08:11.212
<i>so Gusty hid it in a place</i>

08:11.300 --> 08:14.070
<i>it has taken me
millennia to discover.</i>

08:14.236 --> 08:17.484
<i>An enchanted cave
high atop Mt. Everhoof</i>

08:17.572 --> 08:21.096
<i>protected by magical
winds that prevent anypony</i>

08:21.192 --> 08:22.566
<i>from reaching its peak.</i>

08:22.771 --> 08:27.363
<i>There the bell has
remained... until now.</i>

08:27.878 --> 08:32.596
Scale Mt. Everhoof.
Bring me back my bell.

08:32.784 --> 08:36.323
Ha ha! The ease of this
task is laughable.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.095
Well, it sounded easy.

08:48.738 --> 08:50.252
Scale the mountain.

08:50.340 --> 08:52.055
Retrieve Grogar's bell.

08:52.203 --> 08:54.919
Together! I drew
up a detailed plan

08:55.007 --> 08:57.590
with several visual
aides to show how we can...

08:57.900 --> 08:59.982
ditch each other
and do it alone.

09:00.132 --> 09:01.946
Maybe when I'm waiting
for them at the top,

09:02.034 --> 09:03.935
then they'll appreciate me.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

09:28.260 --> 09:31.809
As if anything on this
mountain is scarier than I.

09:31.897 --> 09:33.371
Ha ha ha ha!

09:41.821 --> 09:42.918
Ptui!

09:48.163 --> 09:51.191
Halt! Who goes there? A pony?

09:51.308 --> 09:53.160
There ain't been
ponies round here in

09:53.248 --> 09:55.340
I-don't-know-how-many moons!

09:58.889 --> 10:00.535
Oh, golly, good sir.

10:00.623 --> 10:04.206
I am just a poor lost
pony looking for help.

10:04.409 --> 10:06.488
Oh, don't fret li'l filly.

10:06.576 --> 10:09.492
Ol' Rusty Bucket here,
at yer service!

10:09.580 --> 10:11.982
I'm so glad
I found you.

10:12.071 --> 10:15.552
I need help getting to
the top of the mountain.

10:15.754 --> 10:17.421
No can do, ma'am.

10:18.181 --> 10:19.295
Why not?

10:20.484 --> 10:25.286
Shh! Not so loud! This here's
avalanche territory!

10:25.467 --> 10:27.415
I'm the guardian of
this here mountain.

10:27.502 --> 10:30.153
It's my job to keep
ponies from heading up.

10:30.241 --> 10:32.553
Nothing at the top
but dangerous snow,

10:32.641 --> 10:35.123
dangerous ice, and
dangerous wind.

10:35.210 --> 10:37.833
Basically, it's dangerous.

10:38.291 --> 10:41.036
It must get lonely
all by yourself.

10:41.139 --> 10:43.474
Maybe I could be
your... friend?

10:44.021 --> 10:45.786
I'd love a friend!

10:46.037 --> 10:47.919
So now that we
are friends,

10:48.007 --> 10:50.435
you could help me
up the mountain.

10:51.505 --> 10:54.026
A real friend wouldn't
ask me to do something

10:54.114 --> 10:55.396
I'm not supposed to do.

10:55.484 --> 10:57.989
Says so right here in the
journal of friendship

10:58.077 --> 11:01.075
written by Twilight
Sparkle and her friends.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.452
ARE! YOU! KIDDING ME!

11:08.410 --> 11:09.497
Sshhhhhhh!

11:10.554 --> 11:12.202
I didn't want to
be friends anyway.

11:12.290 --> 11:13.528
Aww...

11:31.700 --> 11:33.111
Almost there.

11:55.724 --> 11:58.324
Nope. Not that
way neither.

12:08.852 --> 12:10.886
I tried being nice.

12:12.519 --> 12:16.303
Shhhhh. Now just calm
down there, filly.

12:16.391 --> 12:17.392
You calm down!

12:17.480 --> 12:21.339
Ponies are supposed to
do what I ask them to do!

12:21.427 --> 12:23.663
It's like my thing, OK?

12:31.599 --> 12:32.599
Eh.

12:38.030 --> 12:41.446
Apparently I don't
need anypony else.

13:03.892 --> 13:06.066
It's not. Funny. Tirek.

13:06.214 --> 13:10.808
Didn't make it to the
top? Surprise surprise.

13:11.035 --> 13:13.149
You didn't make it
to the top either!

13:13.237 --> 13:15.547
I didn't try to.

13:15.635 --> 13:16.688
What?

13:16.776 --> 13:18.858
It took about five
minutes to deduce

13:18.946 --> 13:20.602
that Grogar was right.

13:20.690 --> 13:22.860
None of us could
make it up alone.

13:22.948 --> 13:25.852
So rather than subject
myself to the elements,

13:25.940 --> 13:29.663
I decided to let you
two face the danger,

13:29.751 --> 13:33.401
take what you learned and
use it to my advantage.

13:34.963 --> 13:37.604
I put up with your "I'm
smarter than you" attitude

13:37.692 --> 13:40.063
in Tartarus! But
I'm over it!

13:40.227 --> 13:42.709
I've had enough of you
trying to manipulate me

13:42.797 --> 13:45.547
with that insincere
syrupy sweetness.

13:45.634 --> 13:48.407
At least now we can
see the real you.

13:48.495 --> 13:52.412
This is not the real me!
I'm cute and lovable!

13:52.649 --> 13:58.266
Ha! No, you're not. You're
annoying and you snore!

13:58.455 --> 13:59.903
I do not snore!

14:03.123 --> 14:06.306
At least I don't talk to
my gram-gram in my sleep.

14:06.508 --> 14:09.369
Don't you dare bring
Gram-Gram into this!

14:11.626 --> 14:13.108
This is your fault!

14:22.346 --> 14:23.594
Mmm.

14:27.021 --> 14:28.850
Quick! It's
distracted! Let's go!

14:28.938 --> 14:29.943
Wait.

14:38.967 --> 14:41.953
Mmmm. So much love.

14:42.058 --> 14:45.441
I haven't eaten
this well in ages.

14:45.794 --> 14:48.143
So gross.

14:48.230 --> 14:49.640
Just so we're clear.

14:49.824 --> 14:51.906
I didn't save you
because I like you.

14:51.994 --> 14:53.914
I did it because...
Because I...

14:54.002 --> 14:56.226
Need us?

14:56.314 --> 14:57.629
Yes.

14:57.780 --> 15:00.295
Clearly, I was
right to wait.

15:00.445 --> 15:03.228
Now tell me everything
you learned today.

15:03.316 --> 15:04.875
Leave nothing out.

15:09.961 --> 15:11.432
Why are you doing that?

15:11.519 --> 15:13.343
Didn't you already
drain it of love?

15:13.431 --> 15:16.031
I always save a little
for the next day.

15:16.135 --> 15:18.884
You cocoon all of
your... meals?

15:19.020 --> 15:20.257
Of course.

15:20.390 --> 15:22.531
So when you pony-napped
Twilight and the others,

15:22.619 --> 15:24.000
you cocooned them.

15:24.088 --> 15:27.404
Yes. Until that sow
Starlight Glimmer

15:27.575 --> 15:31.526
freed them, corrupted my
subjects, and stole my hive!

15:31.746 --> 15:33.761
Those ponies have weaknesses.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.231
I used that turncoat Discord.

15:36.319 --> 15:38.507
Tricked him into
helping me capture his

15:38.595 --> 15:40.578
so called "friends".

15:41.122 --> 15:45.344
Discord was really something
until friendship ruined him.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.799
You should've seen
Twilight's face

15:47.887 --> 15:50.463
when her friends appeared
in bubbles around me.

15:50.551 --> 15:51.551
She was all...

15:58.124 --> 16:00.439
She's so stressed
out all the time!

16:00.802 --> 16:03.377
When I posed as her
former foal-sitter,

16:03.465 --> 16:05.647
I thought she was
going to implode.

16:08.943 --> 16:10.491
I wish I could
have seen her face

16:10.579 --> 16:13.448
when I nearly erased all
the magic from Equestria.

16:13.604 --> 16:17.385
All magic was a little
excessive, don't you think?

16:17.519 --> 16:18.666
Meh. I think big.

16:18.753 --> 16:21.236
Besides, it would've
been worth it

16:21.324 --> 16:24.924
just to see Twilight and
her friends bow down to me.

16:25.012 --> 16:28.842
Indeed, it would. Who
wouldn't love to see

16:28.930 --> 16:32.603
those prissy ponies realize
they've lost everything!

16:33.738 --> 16:36.314
I'm a pathetic pony princess!

16:36.402 --> 16:40.720
I made a detailed list of
all the ways I'm a failure!

16:44.646 --> 16:46.894
You know, working with you two

16:46.981 --> 16:49.260
may not be the worst thing.

16:49.481 --> 16:52.233
Perhaps... as long as it results

16:52.321 --> 16:55.004
in the complete
destruction of our enemies.

16:55.092 --> 16:57.440
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

16:57.682 --> 16:59.797
Do the pathetic
princess thing again!

17:17.011 --> 17:17.959
I'm OK!

18:11.531 --> 18:13.613
Can you absorb it
and make it go away?

18:13.701 --> 18:17.176
I can only absorb magic
from living beings.

18:17.526 --> 18:18.996
Like her?

18:19.879 --> 18:21.054
Betrayal!

18:21.142 --> 18:23.324
Not betrayal. Teamwork.

18:23.412 --> 18:25.293
If Tirek absorbs your energy,

18:25.418 --> 18:27.600
he might be strong
enough to break through.

18:27.709 --> 18:29.115
And then?

18:29.217 --> 18:31.437
Then... he
gives it back.

18:31.525 --> 18:32.599
I do?

18:32.687 --> 18:33.735
Mhm.

18:34.021 --> 18:36.880
How do I know you won't
take my magic and leave me?

18:36.968 --> 18:39.263
Would we do
that to you?

18:40.360 --> 18:42.608
OK. Normally
yes, we would.

18:42.696 --> 18:45.546
I'll give you
your magic back.

18:46.272 --> 18:47.710
Do it.

18:55.476 --> 19:00.164
So. Much. Power!

19:01.398 --> 19:03.796
Welcome back, baby.

19:04.996 --> 19:07.296
It's not big enough for me.

19:07.392 --> 19:09.601
Maybe not you.

19:09.849 --> 19:13.532
Keep it open or I'll
be trapped forever!

19:14.109 --> 19:16.460
Would that be so terrible?

19:19.738 --> 19:24.062
Can't... hold... much longer.

19:24.845 --> 19:26.546
Hurry!

19:29.957 --> 19:31.648
Ta-da.

19:31.839 --> 19:33.506
My magic.

19:41.382 --> 19:44.351
I... wasn't sure you were
going to give it back.

19:44.595 --> 19:47.703
Neither was I. But working
together seemed...

19:47.791 --> 19:50.679
smarter than to
continue fighting.

19:50.767 --> 19:53.516
When we helped each other,
it felt better somehow.

19:53.835 --> 19:57.200
I haven't felt like this
since before I lost my hive.

19:57.335 --> 19:59.450
Having others who will
be there for you...

19:59.671 --> 20:01.820
is pleasing.

20:02.032 --> 20:07.247
All of these years...
taking power from ponies.

20:07.335 --> 20:10.060
When you use your
power to help others.

20:10.151 --> 20:11.950
Yes... it feels.

20:12.435 --> 20:14.001
No!

20:14.088 --> 20:15.736
Whoa!

20:15.823 --> 20:19.319
The magic of friendship
is like a disease.

20:19.407 --> 20:22.256
An infection that spreads
to those around you!

20:22.362 --> 20:24.244
I watched it
infect my hive.

20:24.394 --> 20:26.475
I will not let it get me.

20:26.639 --> 20:28.522
- Same!
- Obviously.

20:28.714 --> 20:32.241
But... Grogar said we
have to work together.

20:32.340 --> 20:34.311
Grogar is too powerful.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.481
Something must be
done about that.

20:37.607 --> 20:41.104
Let Grogar think we're
his loyal servants.

20:41.192 --> 20:45.327
In the meantime, we'll
hatch our own plan.

20:45.587 --> 20:49.036
Oh. I love a good
backstabbing!

20:49.123 --> 20:50.571
After that, we can go back

20:50.658 --> 20:53.040
to trying to
destroy each other.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.829
In the meantime, what
do we do with this?

20:57.210 --> 21:00.693
You failed to
retrieve the bell?

21:01.202 --> 21:03.684
We're sorry,
Almighty Grogar.

21:03.771 --> 21:06.554
We worked together
as you asked!

21:06.641 --> 21:09.056
We just aren't as
powerful as you!

21:13.460 --> 21:15.256
Obviously.

21:15.353 --> 21:17.264
At least you finally
did as you were told

21:17.352 --> 21:18.859
and worked together.

21:19.791 --> 21:21.239
Of course.

21:21.327 --> 21:22.869
Whatever you command.

21:22.957 --> 21:24.672
Forget about
that old bell.

21:24.773 --> 21:25.896
You were right.

21:25.984 --> 21:28.077
We're so much more powerful

21:28.165 --> 21:30.102
when we work
as a team.
