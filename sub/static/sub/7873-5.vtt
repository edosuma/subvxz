WEBVTT

00:50.716 --> 00:54.250
I just made a killing
in the shock market.

01:05.104 --> 01:07.594
Time! Reset the test course.

01:14.112 --> 01:16.685
Deputy Director.
I had no idea you were here.

01:16.781 --> 01:20.280
Glad I could be so impressive.
I'll take my victory muffin now.

01:20.367 --> 01:23.322
Make it bran.

01:23.413 --> 01:26.366
I'm afraid your usual muffin's
been earmarked.

01:26.457 --> 01:28.782
Hi. Agent Duper. Big fan.

01:28.876 --> 01:33.585
Agent Duper not only bested your time,
he did so with a far better catchphrase.

01:33.672 --> 01:36.838
- What, better than "shock market"?
- Duper?

01:36.924 --> 01:40.542
Lucy, you got some 'sploding to do.

01:42.888 --> 01:44.845
Oh, we're doing accents now?

01:47.393 --> 01:51.639
But at the last minute,
God told Abraham not to sacrifice his son.

01:51.730 --> 01:54.055
It was all just a test of his faith.

01:54.149 --> 01:57.682
My uncle's doing 25 to life
for sacrificing his son.

01:57.776 --> 02:00.066
Well, I hope he found God.

02:00.155 --> 02:04.198
He sure didn't find him
in my cousin's stomach.

02:06.535 --> 02:10.318
This is my Bible class.
Please, dim your headlights.

02:10.413 --> 02:15.075
Bible class, huh? Tell them the story
of how God was denied his fruity cereal.

02:15.167 --> 02:17.374
No, wait, that was the Trix rabbit.

02:17.461 --> 02:20.212
I get them confused,
because they're both fake.

02:20.297 --> 02:23.417
- When did you become so jaded?
- She's a harlot!

02:23.509 --> 02:26.544
- They should be stoned!
- Way ahead of you, kid.

02:29.097 --> 02:31.669
I'm telling you,
that Duper is out for my job.

02:31.765 --> 02:35.384
I always get the muffin! Always!
Dammit!

02:35.478 --> 02:40.768
- Did you use my "shock market" line?
- Yeah, and it died. Thanks a lot, Larry David.

02:40.858 --> 02:44.272
Done with your foot cream.
I got most of it back in the tube.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.353
Can't you get your own?

02:46.445 --> 02:49.068
Love to,
but you won't let me leave the house.

02:49.157 --> 02:51.730
So unless you open
a Circle K in the dining room,

02:51.826 --> 02:53.865
looks like we're ointment buddies.

02:53.953 --> 02:58.614
And FYI, your roll-on
really worked wonders on my 'rhoids.

02:58.706 --> 02:59.739
Great.

02:59.834 --> 03:03.202
Francine, this Duper situation
is out of control.

03:03.294 --> 03:06.710
Why don't you invite your boss
over for dinner tomorrow?

03:06.798 --> 03:09.549
For some good old-fashioned boot-licking.

03:09.633 --> 03:12.303
Dinner, huh? Great idea.

03:12.387 --> 03:15.837
Chinese toothbrush.
They can make chicken taste like orange,

03:15.931 --> 03:18.932
but when it comes to oral hygiene,
they phone it in.

03:24.856 --> 03:27.014
- You bitch!
- Bitch!

03:28.734 --> 03:31.937
They sure knew how to write
female characters back then.

03:32.029 --> 03:36.572
Look alive, people! What the hell?
If my boss sees you, I'm finished.

03:36.659 --> 03:38.946
That's him. Up in your attic. Move!

03:39.035 --> 03:42.238
- Now you're doing this?
- I haven't been feeling so great.

03:42.330 --> 03:44.701
- Once it dries, it'll chip right off.
- Go!

03:44.790 --> 03:47.541
- Can I top off my Chardonnay?
- I'll bring it later.

03:47.626 --> 03:51.209
Bright and summery on the palate,
with an explosive finish.

03:51.296 --> 03:53.455
All right, I'm going!

03:58.010 --> 04:02.258
- Deputy Director Bullock. Welcome.
- We're so glad you could make it.

04:02.349 --> 04:06.428
- Where's your wife this evening?
- Handcuffed to a radiator in Fallujah.

04:06.519 --> 04:10.515
She wanted to come,
but I do not negotiate with terrorists.

04:10.605 --> 04:13.393
Do I smell meat loaf?

04:13.484 --> 04:16.399
- Hayley, why don't you say grace?
- I'll pass.

04:16.486 --> 04:19.024
You pray all the time
when Jeff comes over.

04:19.113 --> 04:22.279
- "Oh, God! Oh, God!"
- Yes, yes. She's very devout.

04:22.366 --> 04:25.901
Anyway, what are these photos doing
laminated in our place mats?

04:25.995 --> 04:28.034
- Is this Agent Duper?
- Yes.

04:28.121 --> 04:32.166
And he's eating a falafel recreationally.
Terrorist.

04:32.250 --> 04:37.755
Smith! It appears you've gone
to great lengths to discredit a fellow agent.

04:37.839 --> 04:40.163
I like your style.

04:40.257 --> 04:42.049
- Slut!
- Slut!

04:46.095 --> 04:50.557
God! Who do you have to probe around here
to get a Chardonnay?

04:59.107 --> 05:00.899
- Idaho!
- That's all 50.

05:00.984 --> 05:03.523
- Idaho.
- Well done, Smith!

05:06.907 --> 05:09.658
Pardon me.
I think I hear my wife's pie burning.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.948
That's my boss!
Have you lost your mind?

05:12.036 --> 05:14.741
- No, but I lost my buzz, thanks to you.
- Smith?

05:14.831 --> 05:17.238
Into the bathroom.

05:18.167 --> 05:20.918
Smith? This might be
the Chardonnay talking,

05:21.003 --> 05:26.128
but I think this bathroom is the perfect place
to discuss your promotion.

05:26.216 --> 05:29.002
- Into the tub!
- Without my flip-flops?

05:30.094 --> 05:33.878
Good God, control yourself!
Stop it! Oh! In my eye!

05:33.973 --> 05:37.423
<i>- Smith, are you under attack in there?</i>
- Everything's fine.

05:37.517 --> 05:40.139
Stand back!

05:40.229 --> 05:43.395
Good God, Smith! What the?

05:49.194 --> 05:53.572
Thanks. How do you expect me to compete
with Duper after what my boss saw?

05:53.657 --> 05:58.734
- It's not my fault I don't feel well.
- You've been nothing but a burden.

05:58.829 --> 06:00.073
Stan, please.

06:00.162 --> 06:02.999
Don't stress him out.
It messes with his stomachs.

06:03.083 --> 06:06.498
It's about time he heard it.
We're the ones risking our necks.

06:06.586 --> 06:10.168
Do you know what'd happen
if the government knew we had an alien?

06:10.256 --> 06:15.131
But he doesn't care! He just lays around
inhaling groceries and pumping out pudding!

06:15.219 --> 06:16.879
Shut up, Stan! Just shut up!

06:16.971 --> 06:20.386
Our lives would be a hell of a lot easier
if you were just gone.

06:20.473 --> 06:22.798
Oh, yeah? Well, I...

06:28.273 --> 06:30.941
Roger! Are you OK?

06:31.024 --> 06:33.313
Oh, bravo. Bravo. Quite a performance.

06:33.402 --> 06:36.734
- Ladies and gentlemen, Ethan Hawke.
- He doesn't look right.

06:36.821 --> 06:40.404
Up and at 'em. Time to make
another awful Richard Linklater movie.

06:40.492 --> 06:43.860
Ignore him. He's being a drama queen.
Everyone up to bed.

06:43.953 --> 06:47.073
- It's 7:45.
- We're going to bed!

06:47.164 --> 06:50.579
"Good night, Klaus"? Jeez.

06:54.003 --> 06:57.088
What commitment!
Wakey-wakey, Mr Hawke!

06:57.173 --> 07:01.751
<i>- Gattaca II finally got its financing.</i>
- Dad, I think he's dead.

07:01.843 --> 07:06.636
Then I guess he wouldn't mind
if I poke him in the eye with a fork.

07:07.599 --> 07:09.924
- He's dead.
- I can't believe he's gone.

07:10.018 --> 07:13.682
He's up in heaven now,
bumming smokes off Jesus.

07:13.771 --> 07:17.520
- Poor Roger.
- We should have a nice memorial service.

07:17.609 --> 07:22.436
No, I'll have to dispose of the body
so the government can't trace it back to us.

07:22.530 --> 07:26.775
At least do it in a way that honours
his memory and all that he meant to us.

07:26.866 --> 07:29.275
Darling, it's me.

07:29.370 --> 07:33.912
Double cheeseburger, small fries,
and a Mr Pibb.

07:33.998 --> 07:38.077
- Not the largest. The one right under that.
- That would be the medium.

07:45.175 --> 07:50.132
Can I get some ketchup? Oh! No,
it's already in there. I see it. I see it.

07:58.229 --> 08:00.351
That sounded kind of effeminate.

08:02.398 --> 08:06.064
Holy crap. Can't a guy fall
into a stress-induced hibernation cycle

08:06.153 --> 08:10.529
without being chucked in the trash?
OK, calm down. Nothing to be scared of.

08:14.576 --> 08:16.486
Get it off me!

08:16.579 --> 08:21.573
Wait a minute. I can use this to get home,
disguised as a lady.

08:21.666 --> 08:25.118
A lady who keeps medical waste
in her pockets.

08:27.671 --> 08:32.049
- You called me, Dad?
- You're having trouble with Roger's death.

08:32.134 --> 08:37.341
It might cheer you up to help me burn
every shred of evidence that he ever existed.

08:37.431 --> 08:39.837
What? Why can't we just hide that stuff?

08:39.932 --> 08:44.760
- It's too risky. No one can know he was here.
- Don't you have any feelings?

08:44.854 --> 08:48.187
Feelings are what women have.
They come from their ovaries.

08:48.274 --> 08:51.642
You're a monster! I have no father.

08:53.404 --> 08:55.480
I'm not a monster.

09:00.201 --> 09:05.028
So if I cash out my pension right now,
how much will I get?

09:05.122 --> 09:08.407
Aw, dammit! That's a very steep penalty.

09:08.500 --> 09:12.913
So basically, you're telling me
I'm stuck here for two more years.

09:13.005 --> 09:15.246
Thanks for nothing, Marty.

09:15.339 --> 09:18.211
So what is it, now?
Your mother died, or something?

09:18.302 --> 09:21.255
No, it was a very dear, dear...

09:21.345 --> 09:24.845
He was like a pet.
You'll have to forgive her. She's very upset.

09:24.932 --> 09:30.389
Could you say a prayer for him on Sunday?
You know, so maybe he'll hear it in heaven.

09:30.479 --> 09:32.602
For a pet.

09:32.689 --> 09:38.229
You're serious. Look, according to
the Church, there are no pets in heaven.

09:38.319 --> 09:42.780
Eligible for heaven: men, women,
children and apes who use sign language.

09:42.866 --> 09:47.906
Not going to heaven: pets, dinosaurs,
smart types and self-aware robots.

09:47.995 --> 09:50.746
<i>You ever seen Blade Runner?</i>

09:51.539 --> 09:54.873
Of course not. All righty.
Can I validate your parking?

09:54.960 --> 10:00.297
Wait a minute. Roger was good. What kind
of a God wouldn't allow him into heaven?

10:00.381 --> 10:02.504
This kind.

10:02.591 --> 10:06.719
- That's your idea of God?
- Kick your ass.

10:09.181 --> 10:10.674
Whatever.

10:10.765 --> 10:15.806
How do I get home? Where the hell is a trail
of Reese's Pieces when you need one?

10:15.894 --> 10:18.766
- Where are you going?
- I'm not an alien.

10:18.856 --> 10:21.430
Back on the bus, Mrs Nesbaum.

10:24.278 --> 10:26.400
This is a mistake. I need to get home.

10:26.488 --> 10:29.821
The home? No.
We're going to DC to see the sights.

10:29.907 --> 10:34.783
Haven't seen you around the pill line.
The name's Gertie.

10:34.870 --> 10:39.663
Now don't you fret about that.
Happens to me all the time.

10:39.750 --> 10:42.370
What do you know! It's happening right now.

10:44.755 --> 10:47.957
Morning. Wanna help
analyse some Al Qaeda chatter?

10:48.049 --> 10:50.718
Actually, they put Agent Duper on chatter.

10:50.802 --> 10:54.300
They bumped you down to Al Qaeda banter.

10:54.388 --> 10:57.555
I tried those whitening strips,
but they don't work.

10:57.642 --> 11:00.428
- You wear them every day?
- Every other day.

11:00.519 --> 11:02.642
That's why they're not working.

11:02.729 --> 11:08.103
Don't you have any feelings?
You're a monster! I have no father.

11:11.737 --> 11:16.031
- What seems to be the problem?
- Well, I got in an argument with our dog.

11:16.116 --> 11:19.200
He expelled a large amount of xenoplasm
and then died.

11:19.285 --> 11:24.196
- Am I a monster for not feeling anything?
- Depends. How close were you to this dog?

11:24.290 --> 11:26.366
Well, we do go back a ways.

11:27.627 --> 11:32.502
The alien has escaped to level four.
Repeat, level four.

11:33.591 --> 11:36.757
I'll check this lab
where the theremin music is coming from.

11:36.843 --> 11:40.758
Don't hurt me! I know it sounds clichéd,
but I mean you no harm.

11:40.847 --> 11:44.679
You're the alien?
They said you'd be bigger, and with claws.

11:44.768 --> 11:49.144
Oh, I've got claws. Look how fat you are.
See? Kitty can scratch.

11:49.229 --> 11:52.100
It's in the lab! Let's dust it!

11:53.358 --> 11:55.813
Let's go, space chimp!

12:10.541 --> 12:13.992
You saved my life.
How can I ever repay you?

12:14.085 --> 12:15.580
You got TiVo?

12:15.670 --> 12:17.745
Stan?

12:17.838 --> 12:23.343
Thought I lost you there. Now, look.
This is a safe place. How do you feel?

12:23.886 --> 12:26.507
Well, I guess I feel kind of sad.

12:26.597 --> 12:30.676
- And do you know why?
- Because I miss him?

12:30.767 --> 12:35.311
No. Because you're a lady!

12:36.230 --> 12:38.389
"Oh, yeah! I'm sensitive!"

12:38.482 --> 12:41.816
- I am not a lady!
- Wait, Stan. You forgot your purse.

12:41.903 --> 12:46.114
I swear I'd lose my own head if...
Hey! I don't have a purse!

12:48.575 --> 12:52.573
Heaven, Pearly Gates, angels?
It's all a lie.

12:52.662 --> 12:55.330
When your parents die,
they'll be in the ground,

12:55.414 --> 12:59.709
worms slowly chewing
through their foul, putrid organs.

12:59.794 --> 13:03.494
Don't worry, kids. God is real,
Jesus loves you, et cetera.

13:03.589 --> 13:06.791
- Mom, what are you doing?
- I just can't believe in a God

13:06.883 --> 13:09.421
that wouldn't let Roger into heaven.

13:09.511 --> 13:14.219
Hey, Hayley. Since Dad's a heartless bastard,
I'm auditioning new father figures.

13:14.307 --> 13:17.343
Should I go with
outwardly affectionate Tom Hanks,

13:17.435 --> 13:20.221
or consistently underrated Jeff Bridges?

13:20.311 --> 13:23.847
Why are you worried about Dad?
It's Mom that we've lost.

13:23.941 --> 13:25.648
<i>Steve, mein Kinderstrudel.</i>

13:25.734 --> 13:29.731
There's an emotionally available father figure
floating in front of you.

13:29.821 --> 13:33.023
<i>- Really? You'd be my dad?</i>
- It would be mein honour.

13:33.115 --> 13:35.689
Now, here's your allowance. Five bubbles.

13:35.785 --> 13:40.245
What the hell. Six bubbles.
Don't tell your mother.

13:42.791 --> 13:48.545
Wow, the Oval Office. Just think of the
history that's been made behind that desk.

13:48.630 --> 13:50.871
Not to mention under it.

13:51.924 --> 13:55.624
- Have yourself a nip.
- Wow, getting hammered in the Oval Office.

13:55.718 --> 14:00.097
Hey, look. I'm Kitty Dukakis
in an alternate time line.

14:00.182 --> 14:05.057
This footage was captured at 1400 hours
today by a White House security camera.

14:05.144 --> 14:08.097
Sorry I'm late.
I was getting a piping hot cup of coffee.

14:08.188 --> 14:11.640
It's far too hot to drink,
but my leathery man mouth can take it.

14:11.734 --> 14:15.683
Sit down. Our analysts
have confirmed this creature is none other

14:15.779 --> 14:20.072
than the alien that escaped
from Area 51 four years ago.

14:20.574 --> 14:23.245
- My eyes!
- He's alive!

14:23.328 --> 14:26.696
Naturally, recapturing this fugitive
is our top priority.

14:26.789 --> 14:30.074
Then we can track down the bastards
who harboured it,

14:30.167 --> 14:33.500
and punish them brutally.

14:33.586 --> 14:35.959
I mean really brutally.

14:36.048 --> 14:39.048
Weird stuff. Butt stuff.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.133
Somebody take Smith's coffee.

14:48.226 --> 14:49.257
Smith. Talk.

14:49.352 --> 14:52.802
Stan, you lantern-jawed sasquatch.

14:52.896 --> 14:55.517
You throw any of your kids
in the garbage today?

14:55.607 --> 15:00.103
- I've been looking for you. Where are you?
- I'm getting by just fine on my own.

15:00.195 --> 15:03.645
- And I got something to say to you...
- Call him a carpetbagger!

15:03.739 --> 15:07.440
You're a carpetbagger, Stan, you know that?
What's that?

15:07.534 --> 15:12.113
I'm sure you're mad I chucked you
in the trash, but I'm willing to forgive me.

15:12.206 --> 15:15.289
But the important thing is,
the CIA is looking for you.

15:15.375 --> 15:18.957
Bring 'em on! I got some stories to tell
about who's been hiding me.

15:19.045 --> 15:24.383
Hope you and your family like prison,
because that's where you'll be rotting! Prison!

15:24.467 --> 15:27.669
I'm not screwing around.
My butt is literally on the line.

15:27.761 --> 15:32.387
Well, that must be one massive line,
because your butt is huge!

15:35.684 --> 15:41.023
So, old buddy, to protect our family,
we must kill a friend.

15:41.106 --> 15:45.021
Don't worry, it's not you.
I could never be mad at you.

15:46.194 --> 15:47.937
Made you laugh.

15:49.490 --> 15:54.530
Gun, we've got to track down and kill Roger
before the CIA finds him.

15:54.619 --> 15:57.369
Oh, gun! Crack a window!

15:57.454 --> 16:00.123
Boy, I really got up in Stan's grille, huh?

16:00.207 --> 16:04.833
He was all, "Come back,"
and I was all, "Fat-ass carpetbagger!"

16:04.920 --> 16:08.787
He had it comin'. That family
don't give a Dixie toot about you.

16:08.882 --> 16:10.957
From now on, we're family.

16:11.050 --> 16:14.087
We are, aren't we? Oh, my God.

16:16.638 --> 16:21.347
<i>A Dynasty exhibit. They must have gotten</i>
my letters. Can we go? Can we go? Can we?

16:21.435 --> 16:25.598
Sounds glorious. Let's get movin', sis.

16:25.689 --> 16:27.563
Almost forgot.

16:27.649 --> 16:33.188
That's for freein' the slaves,
you Negro-lovin' Yankee devil!

16:34.446 --> 16:37.483
And suddenly things turned ugly...

16:37.575 --> 16:42.236
Roger? Here, boy.
Dammit! Where could he be?

16:42.328 --> 16:47.535
- This ain't your corner, bitch!
- Well, I guess my GPS is out of whack, slut!

16:47.624 --> 16:50.199
- Bitch!
- Slut!

16:50.295 --> 16:52.417
This reminds me of something.

16:53.088 --> 16:55.330
<i>Dynasty!</i>

16:56.008 --> 16:58.794
CIA! To the Smithsonian! Drive!

16:58.885 --> 17:01.555
Wait. This is my car. Even better!

17:01.638 --> 17:05.137
Now, son, here's a fun activity
my father taught me.

17:05.223 --> 17:09.008
- I feel weird washing Mom's underwear.
- Nonsense! We're bonding.

17:09.103 --> 17:11.510
Now bury me in an avalanche of panties.

17:11.604 --> 17:15.223
<i>Ja, ja! A sweaty, sweaty sports bra!</i>

17:18.069 --> 17:23.063
- Mom, you're reading the Bible again.
- No! There's an oil spill in the garage.

17:23.156 --> 17:25.862
I'm just gonna mop it up with "Exodus".

17:26.994 --> 17:29.319
- Hello?
- Hayley? Roger. Got a sec?

17:29.413 --> 17:34.538
<i>Roger? Whoa! Is this one of those Twilight</i>
Zone phones where I can talk to the dead,

17:34.626 --> 17:37.081
but only with horrible, ironic consequences?

17:37.169 --> 17:41.297
Oh, right. It's past noon.
You're already high. Let me talk to the fish.

17:41.382 --> 17:43.339
Oh, my God! You're really alive?

17:43.426 --> 17:46.877
Yes, and I've somehow acquired
a nasty old racist sidekick.

17:46.971 --> 17:49.295
I'm at the Smithsonian. Come get me.

17:49.389 --> 17:53.256
There you are! You send me to get you
a churro, then you disappear.

17:53.351 --> 17:56.969
- Here's your filthy wetback doughnut.
- Hurry.

18:00.232 --> 18:02.984
We've tracked the alien here.
We need to take it alive

18:03.069 --> 18:05.903
so we can punish
those who've been hiding it.

18:07.155 --> 18:09.362
Not if I get to him first.

18:09.449 --> 18:14.490
Oh, my God! Joan Collins' ball gown.
Linda Evans' tennis outfit.

18:14.578 --> 18:19.324
Wow! John Forsythe's girdle.
Oh, the stories it could tell.

18:19.416 --> 18:21.623
- Roger?
- Steve! Hayley!

18:21.710 --> 18:26.170
- Oh, thank God you came!
- Roger's alive? It's a miracle!

18:26.256 --> 18:29.625
<i>I knew you couldn't resist</i>
a federally funded Dynasty exhibit.

18:29.718 --> 18:34.130
Stan! Look, about that phone call...
What are you doing?

18:34.222 --> 18:37.803
- Say your prayers, space chimp.
- Stan, no!

18:37.891 --> 18:39.552
Leave her alone, whitey!

18:55.032 --> 19:01.864
- Dammit! He's getting away!
- We're parachute ghosts!

19:05.959 --> 19:09.244
All this for a fat-ass comment?

19:09.337 --> 19:12.503
- No, former dad!
- Nobody threatens my family!

19:12.590 --> 19:16.919
- Get out of the way, or I'll shoot you all.
- It's my junior prom all over again.

19:17.011 --> 19:21.257
Leave her alone,
you two-dollar Pai Gow whore!

19:23.600 --> 19:26.766
We know you're in there!
Come out with your tentacles up!

19:26.852 --> 19:29.889
- You can'tjust give him up.
- That's the CIA out there.

19:29.981 --> 19:33.598
They won't stop
until they have Roger in custody.

19:33.692 --> 19:38.519
- Just make it quick.
- No, Roger! Use my children as a shield.

19:38.613 --> 19:42.113
It's no use. They've got me.
And if they torture me, I'll crack.

19:42.201 --> 19:45.818
I can't even make it through the afternoon
without a mojito.

19:45.912 --> 19:49.529
- I'd never put my family's safety at risk.
- Your family?

19:49.623 --> 19:54.202
Of course. Now, how are we gonna do this?
I think right here would be most dramatic.

19:54.295 --> 19:56.915
OK.

19:57.005 --> 20:00.919
What's this? Some kind of tear-like substance
coming from my eyes.

20:01.009 --> 20:02.917
- He's crying.
- I'm not a lady!

20:03.010 --> 20:06.711
Stan, having feelings
doesn't make you a lady.

20:06.806 --> 20:11.135
- It makes you human.
- We've got to blow this door!

20:11.226 --> 20:15.175
Prepare the door blower!
We really should find a better name for that.

20:15.271 --> 20:20.396
Well, it's clear what I have to do.

20:20.943 --> 20:24.526
- Smith!
- I've got the alien, sir.

20:24.614 --> 20:27.732
Give me back my wig,
you scalp-happy red man!

20:27.824 --> 20:30.696
Look how it mimics our language.

20:32.203 --> 20:34.410
Well done, Agent Smith!

20:34.497 --> 20:39.621
I'm going to strike the words "tool" and
"incompetent" from your personal record.

20:39.710 --> 20:44.206
Thanks. Perhaps you could insert
the words "lady" and "not a".

20:44.298 --> 20:47.215
You know... I think we can.

20:50.262 --> 20:54.094
- It's good to have you back, buddy.
- So, Roger, what was heaven like?

20:54.182 --> 20:56.755
Heaven? What the hell are you?

20:56.851 --> 20:59.342
Oh, yeah. Heaven. Oh, it was great.

20:59.437 --> 21:03.220
Fluffy clouds, unicorns,
bubble-gum waterfalls, all that crap.

21:03.314 --> 21:06.067
Roger's our little miracle, isn't he, Mom?

21:06.152 --> 21:10.480
He sure is. God certainly works
in mysterious ways.

21:11.656 --> 21:13.862
Oh, wait. This is last month.
