WEBVTT

00:02.229 --> 00:05.703
In closing, I can tell you
we take this very seriously.

00:05.820 --> 00:08.394
APD as well as the DEA.

00:08.478 --> 00:11.049
Stopping the manufacture
and sale of methamphetamines

00:11.069 --> 00:12.983
remains one of
our highest priorities.

00:13.003 --> 00:15.974
And the theft of lab equipment
from your school is also receiving

00:15.994 --> 00:17.373
our highest attention.

00:17.415 --> 00:20.291
Rest assured, no stone
will go unturned

00:20.314 --> 00:23.492
in our search for the person or persons
responsible for this.

00:23.512 --> 00:26.067
If you have any questions,
now would be the time.

00:26.233 --> 00:29.655
You're talking like you haven't
caught anybody yet.

00:29.708 --> 00:32.293
What about the janitor
that was dealing drugs at the school?

00:32.313 --> 00:36.117
There is no indication that
this individual was selling drugs.

00:36.189 --> 00:40.063
He was arrested for having
a small amount of marijuana in his car,

00:40.083 --> 00:41.665
not in the school.

00:41.702 --> 00:43.605
And he's
since been fired.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.319
I heard he had a record.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.781
I'd like to know how he got
a job here in the first place.

00:47.802 --> 00:50.936
- Why wasn't there a background check?
- There was one.

00:50.956 --> 00:54.209
We're currently reviewing
our hiring policies.

00:54.229 --> 00:57.844
You better be doing more than that.
He was arrested in front of my daughter.

00:57.869 --> 01:00.092
This guy was stealing
the lab equipment, right?

01:00.112 --> 01:02.144
That's not our thinking
at this time.

01:02.182 --> 01:05.839
We are looking at others who had access,
not limited to the maintenance staff.

01:05.859 --> 01:09.324
Are you saying there was a break-in?
Do we know exactly when this happened?

01:09.344 --> 01:11.603
I mean, could it have been
during school hours?

01:11.666 --> 01:13.858
We haven't been able
to establish a date or time,

01:13.878 --> 01:16.597
but there is no sign
of breaking or entering.

01:16.667 --> 01:18.833
Whoever took it had a key?

01:19.360 --> 01:23.011
We're talking inside job?
Someone who's still at the school?

01:23.037 --> 01:27.002
At this time I'm not able to discuss
the details, but what I can tell you

01:27.036 --> 01:30.127
is that we have some very good people
working very hard on this case.

01:30.147 --> 01:32.811
I'm sorry, Officer.
But that sounds like double-talk.

01:32.831 --> 01:35.858
We're trying to protect our children.
You have to level with us.

01:35.878 --> 01:38.938
Really, we are giving you
all the information we have.

01:38.963 --> 01:42.475
You know what I'd like to see
in this school? Drug-sniffing dogs.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.803
Yeah, dogs,
and metal detectors,

01:44.823 --> 01:46.773
and locker searches,
and strip searches.

01:46.793 --> 01:50.205
- Our district has strict policies...
- I heard about this school in Canada.

01:50.263 --> 01:53.066
They arrested one of their
groundskeepers with drugs.

01:53.183 --> 01:56.826
And the next day they found out over
half of the students were high on LSD.

01:56.846 --> 01:59.762
LSD? When were you gonna
tell us about the LSD?

01:59.813 --> 02:03.264
No. Please.
No one said anything about LSD.

02:07.521 --> 02:09.705
What about the equipment
that was stolen?

02:09.734 --> 02:13.051
The equipment was taken
from our chemistry department.

02:13.629 --> 02:17.625
And I would like someone
to give us some specifics.

02:18.107 --> 02:19.129
Walt?

02:21.552 --> 02:22.385
Yeah.

02:23.012 --> 02:26.621
Mr. White is currently
on medical leave.

02:27.079 --> 02:29.455
But as he's chair
of the science department,

02:29.475 --> 02:32.737
he's made a very special
effort to be with us here.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.732
And I'd like to take
a moment to thank him for that.

02:44.555 --> 02:48.454
Could you please tell us more
about the equipment that was taken?

02:48.909 --> 02:50.625
- Please.
- Yes.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.949
And thank you.

03:00.572 --> 03:03.793
The inventory list for
the missing labware is as follows:

03:03.813 --> 03:06.801
one 5,000 milliliter

03:07.272 --> 03:09.266
round bottom boiling flask,

03:09.295 --> 03:13.218
one Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 milliliters,

03:14.079 --> 03:16.224
two full-face respirators,

03:17.133 --> 03:18.881
some sep funnels,

03:18.901 --> 03:21.437
a sill head with
a thermometer holder...

03:28.306 --> 03:29.795
Ow, my knee.

03:33.334 --> 03:36.290
Where... did that come from?

03:36.963 --> 03:39.462
And why was it
so damn good?

03:41.297 --> 03:43.437
Because it was illegal.

03:45.211 --> 03:48.211

04:22.103 --> 04:23.530
The basement.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.077
Unfinished, of course.

04:25.097 --> 04:27.041
But just look
at all this space.

04:27.061 --> 04:30.394
You gotta think
rec room, media room.

04:30.414 --> 04:33.243
Just imagine all the things
you could do down here.

04:33.660 --> 04:37.261
Now remember, you're buying
for this fantastic neigorhood.

04:37.288 --> 04:39.646
Big lawns
and shade tress.

04:39.666 --> 04:42.070
Walking distance
to the country club.

04:48.698 --> 04:50.376
What happened there?

04:51.594 --> 04:55.090
Bit of a fixer, but this house
has great bones.

05:00.123 --> 05:02.693
You know what? We're zeroing in.
I've got another listing,

05:02.713 --> 05:04.891
brand-new, right around the corner.

05:05.749 --> 05:06.582
Hi.

05:06.813 --> 05:07.797
Hi.

05:08.418 --> 05:10.576
It's by appointment only.

05:10.927 --> 05:12.795
I'm here to see the owner.

05:14.150 --> 05:15.843
He's in the...

05:17.286 --> 05:19.153
recreational vehicle.

05:24.165 --> 05:26.489
Yo, it's appointment only!

05:39.648 --> 05:41.242
How you feeling?

05:44.065 --> 05:46.097
About as good
as you look.

05:46.250 --> 05:49.833
Jeez, you look like... Lex Luthor.

05:51.136 --> 05:54.119
Listen, I visited you in the hospital,
but you were asleep.

05:54.208 --> 05:57.387
Yeah, Skinny Pete said
you wanted Tuco's address.

05:57.463 --> 06:00.459
Acting like you were
all out for blood.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.346
You are alive,
so obviously you wised up.

06:04.471 --> 06:07.121
- No, I did go see him.
- Bullshit.

06:07.154 --> 06:08.911
Are you selling your house?

06:08.942 --> 06:10.810
I got two dudes
that turned into

06:10.830 --> 06:13.577
raspberry slushie and
flushed down my toilet.

06:13.671 --> 06:16.122
I can't even take
a proper dump in there.

06:16.197 --> 06:19.390
The whole damn house
has got to be haunted by now.

06:20.419 --> 06:23.044
You didn't actually
go see Tuco?

06:24.282 --> 06:25.090
Here.

06:28.542 --> 06:30.902
That is seventeen-five.

06:30.952 --> 06:33.114
Your half of the 35,000.

06:33.190 --> 06:36.388
Plus there's an extra 15 in there.
It's all yours.

06:36.481 --> 06:37.949
You've earned it.

06:38.021 --> 06:39.664
You got this money
from Tuco.

06:39.744 --> 06:40.507
Yeah.

06:40.527 --> 06:43.253
So Tuco gave you this
is what you're saying.

06:43.422 --> 06:46.470
- We made a deal.
- You made a deal?

06:46.537 --> 06:48.253
- That's right.
- Wait.

06:48.791 --> 06:51.517
Why would you make
a deal with that scumbag?

06:51.537 --> 06:53.087
You see what he did to me?

06:53.107 --> 06:55.734
Because I think that
we can do business together.

06:55.754 --> 06:57.940
We came to
an understanding.

06:57.972 --> 07:00.369
No way, man! Okay?
No understanding.

07:00.457 --> 07:02.501
Take a look at
the money in your hand.

07:02.552 --> 07:05.915
Now just imagine
making that every week.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.649
That's right.

07:07.685 --> 07:11.013
Two pounds a week.
35,000 a pound.

07:11.033 --> 07:13.862
Without even talking to me,
you told...

07:14.014 --> 07:17.034
this insane ass clown

07:17.665 --> 07:20.694
dead-eyed killer that, uh...

07:21.071 --> 07:23.270
that we would give him
two pounds a week?

07:23.290 --> 07:24.973
We'll just scale up
our operation.

07:24.993 --> 07:27.632
- We'll add a few more hours...
- Don't talk to me about hours.

07:27.652 --> 07:31.164
What about pseudo, man?
How are we gonna get that?

07:31.429 --> 07:34.816
You think the meth fairy
is just gonna bring it to us?

07:35.348 --> 07:37.898
It takes me a week
to get this stuff.

07:38.132 --> 07:40.383
I'm driving all the way
out to Las Cruces.

07:40.403 --> 07:43.193
200 miles each way
to meet up with my smurfs...

07:43.213 --> 07:46.650
- Smurfs?
- Dudes who go to the drugstores

07:46.670 --> 07:49.523
and get a couple boxes
at a time and then sell them to me.

07:49.557 --> 07:52.896
And that's maybe only good for,
like, maybe a half-pound worth.

07:53.035 --> 07:57.013
See, that's the bottleneck
in your brilliant business plan.

07:57.033 --> 07:57.848
All right.

07:57.868 --> 08:01.617
Of course you would have known that
if you would have just asked me.

08:03.426 --> 08:05.180
Well, here we are again.

08:05.344 --> 08:06.918
Here we are.

08:07.238 --> 08:09.045
- Skyler, you look great.
- Thank you.

08:09.065 --> 08:11.581
You must be, what,
six, seven months?

08:12.076 --> 08:13.312
How goes it?

08:13.413 --> 08:14.675
It's great...

08:15.245 --> 08:18.564
other than waddling to the bathroom
every five minutes.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.668
The baby shower's next week.
It'll be good to...

08:23.703 --> 08:25.671
It'll be good
to have a day that's...

08:25.721 --> 08:27.459
just about Skyler.

08:27.479 --> 08:28.633
Very nice.

08:29.478 --> 08:30.551
Thank you.

08:31.756 --> 08:34.320
Well, Walt, I see you've
committed to the hair loss.

08:34.371 --> 08:35.315
Yeah.

08:36.126 --> 08:38.368
- How do you feel?
- Oh, okay.

08:39.544 --> 08:41.879
You know,
pretty decent actually.

08:41.917 --> 08:45.132
His color is better.
You know, his energy.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.949
And he's even more...

08:49.050 --> 08:50.155
physical.

08:50.175 --> 08:51.611
More physical?

08:51.908 --> 08:53.901
Well... sexual.

08:57.174 --> 08:58.802
Frisky, actually.

08:59.387 --> 09:01.503
I mean, that's got
to be a good sign, right?

09:01.523 --> 09:03.025
Sure, I'll take that.

09:03.045 --> 09:04.329
Right, Walt?

09:04.687 --> 09:07.429
Couldn't that mean that
the chemo is working?

09:07.537 --> 09:11.485
Realistically, it may just mean that
we've got the anti-emetics tuned right.

09:11.544 --> 09:14.873
Truth is, until Walt's finished
this round of chemo

09:14.893 --> 09:18.194
and we look at a new PET scan,
we just can't say for sure.

09:18.273 --> 09:20.557
Isn't there anything else
we could be doing?

09:20.608 --> 09:22.807
I've been wondering about...

09:22.900 --> 09:24.304
alternative medicine.

09:24.354 --> 09:26.512
I mean, Eastern healing.

09:27.898 --> 09:29.854
You know, holistic.

09:29.943 --> 09:32.387
Well, I can't speak
to its efficacy.

09:32.467 --> 09:35.566
But as long as it doesn't
interfere with our treatment,

09:35.626 --> 09:38.409
anything that helps my patient
have a better outlook,

09:38.429 --> 09:41.349
a better comfort,
is fine by me.

09:42.374 --> 09:45.832
So you're saying
it's all psychological.

09:47.415 --> 09:49.388
It doesn't make
any real difference.

09:49.408 --> 09:52.950
Having a better outlook
can make a tremendous difference.

09:53.005 --> 09:56.817
But it's also important
that we manage our expectations.

10:17.446 --> 10:18.355
What?

10:23.415 --> 10:24.838
A junkyard?

10:25.262 --> 10:28.136
Let me guess,
you picked this place?

10:29.123 --> 10:31.748
What's wrong with it?
It's private.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.688
This is like... a non-criminal's
idea of a drug meet.

10:36.962 --> 10:40.611
This is like, "Oh, I saw this
in a movie. Oh, look at me."

10:40.685 --> 10:43.755
So where do you transact
your business? Enlighten me.

10:43.781 --> 10:46.555
I don't know.
How about Taco Cabeza?

10:46.796 --> 10:49.762
Half the deals I've ever done
went down at Taco Cabeza.

10:49.825 --> 10:51.492
Nice and public.

10:51.958 --> 10:53.787
Open 24 hours.

10:54.469 --> 10:57.226
Nobody ever gets shot
at Taco Cabeza.

10:58.105 --> 11:00.364
Hell, why not the mall?

11:01.362 --> 11:04.769
You know, wait at the Gap.
"Hey! It's time for the meet."

11:04.922 --> 11:07.710
You know, I'll put down
the flat-front khakis,

11:07.748 --> 11:10.189
head on over,
grab an Orange Julius.

11:10.240 --> 11:13.669
Skip the part
where psycho lunatic Tuco

11:13.745 --> 11:17.462
comes and steals my drugs
and leaves me bleeding to death.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.636
Look, you don't have
to be here for this.

11:29.901 --> 11:31.907
Okay?
I mean, seriously.

11:32.002 --> 11:33.276
I'm okay.

11:36.188 --> 11:38.004
Nah, I'm no pussy.

11:39.635 --> 11:40.809
I'm good.

11:58.616 --> 12:00.622
Mr. Clean and his boy.

12:02.716 --> 12:04.769
I'm sorry that I had
to tune you up.

12:04.789 --> 12:07.776
Respect, ese.
You gotta give it to get it.

12:11.808 --> 12:14.415
Hey, what are we doing
way the hell out here?

12:14.458 --> 12:17.133
What, they close
the mall or something?

12:18.953 --> 12:21.313
Heisenberg, come on,
break it out.

12:24.671 --> 12:26.880
That's it?
That's all you got?

12:26.981 --> 12:29.265
We had some
production problems.

12:29.605 --> 12:31.592
Point five-three.

12:32.749 --> 12:34.768
I thought you was
a player.

12:34.844 --> 12:37.113
You told me two pounds,

12:37.133 --> 12:40.265
and now you waste my time
with these Chiclets?

12:51.332 --> 12:52.922
17½...

12:52.985 --> 12:56.354
minus the half
for wasting my time.

12:56.384 --> 12:57.357
Hey, come on.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.522
What, you're gonna argue?
You got something to say?

13:03.899 --> 13:06.990
You're doing business
like a couple little bitches.

13:07.747 --> 13:09.224
I want all of it.

13:12.770 --> 13:14.107
70 grand.

13:14.331 --> 13:15.694
What did you say?

13:15.714 --> 13:18.820
You like this product,
and you want more.

13:19.518 --> 13:21.915
Consider it
a capital investment.

13:24.823 --> 13:27.322
Loco bald motherfucker.

13:31.567 --> 13:34.252
52½.
25 points vig.

13:34.993 --> 13:35.939
Vig?

13:38.019 --> 13:40.088
Interest. Weekly.

13:42.521 --> 13:43.480
Okay.

13:44.628 --> 13:45.852
That's...

13:46.823 --> 13:50.634
$65,625 with interest.

13:51.051 --> 13:53.824
- 1.875 pounds.
- No.

13:54.165 --> 13:56.194
2 pounds.
Next Friday.

13:56.219 --> 13:58.478
And no production problems.

14:00.717 --> 14:03.064
Can you handle 4 pounds?

14:06.583 --> 14:09.662
Listen, old man.
Talk is talk.

14:10.157 --> 14:12.592
But owing me money...

14:12.840 --> 14:14.594
that's bad.

14:35.740 --> 14:39.450
What did you just do?

14:42.724 --> 14:44.163
4 pounds.

14:44.313 --> 14:47.229
4 pounds, as if 2 pounds
wasn't bad enough.

14:48.185 --> 14:51.529
We're talking 200-300
boxes of sinus pills.

14:52.260 --> 14:54.358
There ain't that many
smurfs in the world.

14:54.405 --> 14:56.759
We're not going to need
pseudo ephedrine.

14:56.822 --> 14:59.758
We're going to make phenylacetone
in a tube furnace,

14:59.830 --> 15:03.829
then we're gonna use reductive amination
to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.

15:04.097 --> 15:06.242
- So no pseudo?
- No pseudo.

15:07.169 --> 15:08.935
So you do have a plan.

15:09.175 --> 15:11.005
Yeah, Mr. White!

15:11.654 --> 15:13.194
Yeah, science!

15:13.852 --> 15:14.823
Okay.

15:18.892 --> 15:21.680
- What's this?
- That is a shopping list.

15:22.273 --> 15:25.743
Getting some of those items
may be challenging.

15:26.520 --> 15:30.129
"One autotransformer,
6 liters an...

15:30.750 --> 15:34.111
hy... hydrous
methyl... methylamine,

15:34.288 --> 15:36.945
two 35 M&M tube furnaces..."

15:36.965 --> 15:38.780
That's MM: millimeter.

15:38.804 --> 15:42.047
One 70-millimeter would be fine,
but they're hard to come by, so...

15:42.116 --> 15:44.567
"40 grams thorium nitrate"?

15:44.587 --> 15:47.125
Yo, Mr. White, I can't even
pronounce half this shit.

15:47.301 --> 15:48.891
You know what?
Count me out.

15:49.062 --> 15:50.295
I'm leaving town.

15:50.315 --> 15:52.408
I'm moving to, like,
Oregon or something...

15:52.428 --> 15:54.347
Jesse, Jesse,
listen to me.

15:54.897 --> 15:58.894
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

15:59.831 --> 16:01.090
What are you doing?

16:01.110 --> 16:03.229
This is the first day
of the rest of your life,

16:03.249 --> 16:05.260
but what kind of life will it be?

16:05.312 --> 16:08.363
Will be be a life of fear,
of "Oh, no, no, no,

16:08.418 --> 16:12.204
"I can't do this," of never once
believing in yourself?

16:13.517 --> 16:15.435
- I don't know.
- Listen.

16:15.958 --> 16:17.283
These things?

16:17.598 --> 16:18.885
We need them.

16:19.034 --> 16:21.911
And only you
can get them for us.

16:27.408 --> 16:31.024
Okay, it's ready.
There you go.

16:32.127 --> 16:36.115
Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie.

16:36.814 --> 16:40.577
Now, you already know that because
when you watch this 20 years from now,

16:40.597 --> 16:43.360
I will look exactly
the same as I do now.

16:43.473 --> 16:45.208
I know it is amazing.

16:45.272 --> 16:48.325
I have aged shockingly well,
haven't I?

16:49.250 --> 16:50.222
Anyway,

16:50.281 --> 16:54.277
welcome to your
baby shower, Esmeralda!

16:54.922 --> 16:56.168
Esmeralda?

16:56.344 --> 16:57.948
Esmeralda.

16:57.968 --> 17:00.222
That's your name,
and you heard it here first.

17:00.244 --> 17:03.138
Now, that is your wonderful,

17:03.165 --> 17:04.800
handsome older brother.

17:04.820 --> 17:07.007
Show her, older brother,
your face.

17:08.950 --> 17:10.854
Okay. Not right up the nose.

17:11.095 --> 17:13.051
Not...
Back to me.

17:13.204 --> 17:15.638
There's your mommy!

17:16.153 --> 17:18.212
Hello, Mommy!

17:18.237 --> 17:21.594
And look!
There you are, Esmeralda!

17:21.829 --> 17:23.285
Wake up, baby!

17:23.305 --> 17:25.267
Time to party!

17:25.896 --> 17:27.108
Easy.

17:27.371 --> 17:29.678
Believe it or not,
Esmeralda,

17:30.426 --> 17:33.631
right after the party,
your name was changed to Holly.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.002
And I believe, Hank,
that that was around the time

17:36.022 --> 17:38.384
that we took Aunt Marie
to the insane asylum.

17:38.404 --> 17:40.955
Yeah, yeah.
I dropped her off at the curb.

17:40.975 --> 17:44.399
Then I married Shania Twain
and lived happily ever after.

17:45.869 --> 17:49.655
There's Daddy!
Speak, Daddy!

17:50.100 --> 17:52.182
Say hello to your daughter.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.863
Holly, I am very proud of you,

18:01.341 --> 18:04.798
and I think about you all the time.

18:09.090 --> 18:10.630
Wherever you go,

18:12.144 --> 18:14.012
whatever you do in life,

18:15.268 --> 18:17.754
always know
that you have a family

18:17.817 --> 18:20.214
who loves you very,
very much.

18:23.897 --> 18:26.042
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

18:26.436 --> 18:29.654
Oh, my God, it's so cute.

18:29.971 --> 18:32.131
Oh, Carmen, it's...
Oh, look.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.814
Look at that.
It's adorable.

18:35.035 --> 18:37.133
I love it, Carmen.
Thank you.

18:37.171 --> 18:38.632
You're so welcome, honey.

18:38.652 --> 18:41.095
Thank you.
Look at the little feet.

18:45.393 --> 18:46.579
From me.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.367
And Hank.

18:49.259 --> 18:50.889
What nice wrapping paper.

18:50.909 --> 18:53.234
Marie always finds
the best wrapping paper.

18:53.254 --> 18:54.354
I do.

18:54.872 --> 18:55.780
Okay.

18:56.092 --> 18:59.151
Let's see what this is.

18:59.270 --> 19:00.620
Exciting.

19:01.916 --> 19:04.478
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

19:11.313 --> 19:12.537
It's a...

19:13.109 --> 19:14.377
a tiara.

19:17.979 --> 19:19.922
Marie, is this...

19:20.065 --> 19:24.058
White gold and several carats'
worth of zircons.

19:24.078 --> 19:26.526
Oh, Marie, you spent
too much on this.

19:26.546 --> 19:29.908
You shouldn't have.
You really, really shouldn't.

19:30.368 --> 19:32.615
But it's so...
It's really...

19:32.701 --> 19:35.571
It's... sparkly.

19:36.829 --> 19:39.917
Sparkly! Like wow!
Thank you.

19:39.937 --> 19:41.678
Hey, listen, Walt...

19:42.271 --> 19:43.871
You got anything
stronger than beer?

19:43.922 --> 19:45.965
It's just gor...
Oh, it's great.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.076
I love it.
Thank you.

19:48.596 --> 19:51.219
Thank you, sweetie,
thank you.

19:51.779 --> 19:53.016
Sorry, man.

19:53.091 --> 19:56.584
You know, after 200 presents,
it just gets kind of old.

19:59.797 --> 20:02.320
- That's nice stuff.
- It is, isn't it?

20:05.291 --> 20:08.282
I got just the thing
to go with that.

20:13.132 --> 20:14.972
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

20:14.992 --> 20:16.926
No, no, no, no.
It's okay.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.077
You mind
if I have one?

20:20.539 --> 20:22.280
You think it's a good idea?

20:22.469 --> 20:24.740
Hank, I've already got
lung cancer.

20:26.332 --> 20:28.692
Okay. You got me there.

20:31.408 --> 20:32.330
Thanks.

20:35.740 --> 20:36.673
Cuban.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.798
I did a little favor
for an FBI guy.

20:46.310 --> 20:48.592
Now, I was
under the impression...

20:50.684 --> 20:52.794
that these were illegal, hmm?

20:54.111 --> 20:57.123
Yeah, well,
sometimes forbidden fruit

20:57.161 --> 20:59.546
tastes the sweetest,
doesn't it?

21:04.264 --> 21:05.992
It's funny, isn't it?

21:06.227 --> 21:08.492
How we draw that line.

21:08.610 --> 21:09.619
Yeah?

21:10.345 --> 21:12.243
What line is that?

21:13.691 --> 21:16.479
Well, what's legal,
what's illegal,

21:17.401 --> 21:19.544
Cuban cigars, alcohol.

21:20.540 --> 21:23.631
You know, if we were
drinking this in 1930,

21:24.001 --> 21:25.983
we'd be breaking the law.

21:26.412 --> 21:28.683
Another year, we'd be okay.

21:31.214 --> 21:33.813
Who knows what
will be legal next year?

21:35.452 --> 21:37.243
You mean like pot?

21:39.627 --> 21:40.384
Yeah.

21:41.469 --> 21:42.946
Like pot. Or...

21:44.090 --> 21:45.213
whatever.

21:46.623 --> 21:48.856
Cocaine? Heroin?

21:51.335 --> 21:53.586
I'm just saying
it's arbitrary.

21:55.018 --> 21:56.947
Well, you ought to visit lockup.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.620
You hear a lot of guys
talking like that.

21:59.766 --> 22:03.598
"Hey, man, why'd you bust me
with these 14 bales of ganja?

22:03.618 --> 22:07.601
"It's all gonna be legal next year
when Willie Nelson's president."

22:08.288 --> 22:11.468
Shit, buddy,
it doesn't only go one way, either.

22:12.174 --> 22:15.480
Sometimes there's stuff
that's legal that shouldn't be.

22:15.655 --> 22:19.049
I mean, friggin' meth
used to be legal.

22:20.195 --> 22:24.182
Used to sell it over every counter
at every pharmacy across America.

22:24.565 --> 22:27.783
Thank God they came to their
senses on that one, huh?

22:30.378 --> 22:31.261
Yeah.

22:45.128 --> 22:46.554
Nice party.

22:50.555 --> 22:51.753
A tiara.

22:53.185 --> 22:56.768
A white gold tiara
for a newborn baby.

22:57.920 --> 22:58.941
Yeah.

22:59.514 --> 23:03.315
You know, I think she got that
at Gertrude Zachary's in Nob Hill.

23:03.366 --> 23:05.596
I mean, that thing
must have cost, like, what,

23:05.616 --> 23:08.501
$500 or $600.

23:12.028 --> 23:14.605
You know what? I think
I'm going to return it.

23:14.685 --> 23:15.866
You sure?

23:16.302 --> 23:18.308
She's bound to find out.

23:18.609 --> 23:22.596
Well, maybe I can explain to her
that we need a Diaper Genie more than

23:23.139 --> 23:25.814
a white gold baby tiara.

23:30.276 --> 23:33.276
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli

23:33.296 --> 23:35.164
about alternative medicine.

23:35.184 --> 23:37.716
Don't worry. I'm not going
to mention that anymore.

23:37.787 --> 23:41.070
What I mean is that maybe
there is something to it.

23:42.312 --> 23:43.826
Here. Look.

23:44.905 --> 23:48.884
They do this Navajo sweat lodge
up by Farmington.

23:49.727 --> 23:51.784
Healing ceremony.

23:51.811 --> 23:53.904
It's supposed to be
good for your lungs.

23:53.924 --> 23:56.612
I'm not saying
that I believe in it, but...

23:57.221 --> 24:00.161
you know,
it might be an experience.

24:01.963 --> 24:03.011
Really?

24:03.978 --> 24:04.798
You?

24:05.762 --> 24:07.276
In a sweat lodge?

24:07.310 --> 24:10.497
I was thinking about
driving up on Friday,

24:10.548 --> 24:12.896
coming back Sunday.
I mean, if you're okay with it.

24:12.923 --> 24:15.502
Well, of course
I'm okay with that.

24:15.747 --> 24:16.694
Okay.

24:26.407 --> 24:28.489
- Sweat lodge?
- Yeah.

24:28.895 --> 24:31.267
I'm already sweating.
Help me out.

24:32.397 --> 24:34.971
- Okay.
- Right.

24:38.274 --> 24:40.483
70-millimeter tube furnace.
Excellent.

24:40.504 --> 24:42.291
This is excellent.
Very good work.

24:42.311 --> 24:44.159
- Damn straight.
- Okay. Hydrogen.

24:44.184 --> 24:45.944
Electrolytically
produced, yes?

24:45.981 --> 24:47.813
Yeah, like you asked. I mean,

24:47.948 --> 24:49.827
this crap wasn't easy to get.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.571
It was expensive.

24:51.806 --> 24:53.729
Methylamine.
Where's the methylamine?

24:53.749 --> 24:55.621
I don't see the methylamine.

24:55.641 --> 24:58.959
Yeah, well, that's where
I ran into some trouble.

24:59.635 --> 25:01.292
What kind of trouble?

25:01.456 --> 25:04.306
Well, half this crap
I could just buy, right?

25:04.629 --> 25:06.498
But this methylamine...

25:07.149 --> 25:08.329
not so easy.

25:08.349 --> 25:10.428
They got it locked down tight.

25:10.521 --> 25:13.922
But I did find some pros
who will rip it off for us.

25:14.125 --> 25:16.476
But they want 10 grand.

25:16.621 --> 25:18.766
So what's the problem?
You have the money.

25:18.790 --> 25:21.768
No, had. I already spent
almost the whole wad.

25:21.788 --> 25:25.775
I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
I told you, all this crap was expensive.

25:26.229 --> 25:30.220
So these thieves, did they say where
they would be stealing it from?

25:30.456 --> 25:33.220
Yeah, a chemical supply
place south of town.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.654
They got guards
and security cameras,

25:35.674 --> 25:37.390
big ass steel doors.

25:37.410 --> 25:40.417
That's why these dudes
are charging so much.

25:41.125 --> 25:41.882
What?

25:56.198 --> 25:59.640
So why don't we
just steal it ourselves?

26:01.708 --> 26:02.692
Yeah?

26:03.370 --> 26:05.477
How are we
going to do that?

26:06.821 --> 26:07.957
With this.

26:21.984 --> 26:24.440
So what's this
stuff called again?

26:27.447 --> 26:28.682
Thermite.

26:29.168 --> 26:31.351
And that will
cut through a lock?

26:31.597 --> 26:34.361
Because this is supposed
to be one big ass lock.

26:34.491 --> 26:36.498
In World War II,

26:37.141 --> 26:41.101
the Germans had an artillery piece,
it's the biggest in the world,

26:41.239 --> 26:43.218
called the Gustav Gun,

26:43.372 --> 26:46.013
and it weighed
a thousand tons.

26:46.225 --> 26:50.118
And the Gustav was capable
of firing a 7-ton shell

26:50.763 --> 26:54.750
and hitting a target
accurately 23 miles away.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.940
I mean, you could
drop bombs on it

26:58.960 --> 27:02.545
every day for a month
without ever disabling it.

27:03.659 --> 27:06.559
But you drop
a commando,

27:07.430 --> 27:08.717
one man,

27:09.152 --> 27:11.070
with just a bag of this...

27:13.783 --> 27:16.820
and he could melt right through
4 inches of solid steel

27:16.840 --> 27:19.254
and destroy that gun forever.

27:22.216 --> 27:23.352
Jeez!

27:26.972 --> 27:28.145
So yes.

27:29.711 --> 27:33.629
I think it will cut through any lock
we're likely to find.

27:34.447 --> 27:35.909
You'd like to return this?

27:35.929 --> 27:38.563
It's very nice, but yes.

27:39.330 --> 27:41.651
Well, it is from
the store, isn't it?

27:41.748 --> 27:44.006
Oh, yes.
It's from this store.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.566
Do you happen
to have a receipt?

27:46.922 --> 27:49.395
No. I don't.
It was a gift.

27:50.144 --> 27:51.078
A gift.

27:51.516 --> 27:54.292
Mr. Wilson, could you
step over here, please?

27:56.293 --> 28:00.186
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch
this lady while I phone the police.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.005
Excuse me?

28:02.103 --> 28:05.308
Ma'am, this item is stolen,
as I'm sure you know.

28:06.098 --> 28:07.915
Come with me, please.

28:10.409 --> 28:13.437
Oh, yes. I intend
to press charges.

28:15.464 --> 28:16.650
Please do.

28:18.004 --> 28:19.316
We'll be here.

28:20.808 --> 28:22.072
Look, I...

28:22.743 --> 28:25.952
I've never stolen anything
in my life, all right?

28:26.122 --> 28:27.520
I told you.

28:27.568 --> 28:31.299
That tiara was a gift.
A baby shower gift.

28:31.319 --> 28:33.480
So who gave it to you, then?

28:35.486 --> 28:38.824
- I don't think I have to tell you that.
- You don't have to tell me anything.

28:38.874 --> 28:40.621
You can talk to the police,

28:40.895 --> 28:43.450
and I can tell them how
my daughter-in-law remembers

28:43.470 --> 28:46.918
showing this particular item
to a tall blonde woman who,

28:46.938 --> 28:50.063
when her back was turned,
walked right out the door with it.

28:50.101 --> 28:51.217
So there.

28:51.301 --> 28:52.685
Oh, yeah?

28:53.134 --> 28:55.836
Then I can talk
to the Channel 3 News.

28:56.276 --> 28:59.018
Yeah. I can tell them
how you people,

28:59.112 --> 29:02.038
without a shred,
without a modicum of evidence,

29:02.058 --> 29:05.951
illegally detained
an innocent pregnant woman

29:05.971 --> 29:08.217
in a dank storeroom.

29:08.268 --> 29:11.887
- This is my office.
- I feel I'm being held hostage.

29:12.076 --> 29:16.064
Furthermore, I'm not getting
enough air back here.

29:17.053 --> 29:19.135
I don't think I can breathe.

29:19.564 --> 29:20.722
Oh, my God.

29:20.810 --> 29:23.198
Oh, no.
I'm going into labor.

29:23.312 --> 29:24.624
Yes, I...

29:35.898 --> 29:38.237
Hi. You've reached Marie.
Do the beep thing.

29:38.275 --> 29:41.637
Marie? It's Skyler.
I just left Zachary's.

29:41.739 --> 29:44.351
I need to talk to you
immediately.

29:47.136 --> 29:50.114
Where's the guard?
He's supposed to be coming by.

29:50.417 --> 29:53.453
- You think he already passed?
- I don't know.

29:54.857 --> 29:57.141
- There he is.
- Yeah, I see him.

29:57.335 --> 29:58.928
Wait till he passes.

29:59.182 --> 30:00.658
Okay, it's clear.

30:09.059 --> 30:11.574
- What the hell is this?
- It's all they had.

30:11.594 --> 30:13.214
Then you go to another store.

30:13.234 --> 30:16.247
- If this is all they had, wrong place.
- Just put it on.

30:16.267 --> 30:17.972
Of course you can...

30:27.483 --> 30:29.308
Okay.
This is it.

30:31.826 --> 30:32.949
Oh, God.

30:49.621 --> 30:51.905
- Dawm. Where... Duck. Duck.
- What?

30:55.044 --> 30:58.138
He's not supposed to come back.
What's he doing?

30:58.615 --> 30:59.889
Oh, God.

31:02.667 --> 31:04.421
He's going to the crapper.

31:04.458 --> 31:05.507
Oh, God.

31:07.139 --> 31:10.016
- Carry your bag.
- What? What are you doing?

31:42.831 --> 31:44.370
Okay, there is it.

31:46.431 --> 31:48.179
Is this going to be loud?

31:48.199 --> 31:50.556
We'll find out
in about ten seconds.

31:51.914 --> 31:53.075
Stand back.

31:56.461 --> 31:57.420
Jesus!

32:13.926 --> 32:15.396
What's going on?

32:19.106 --> 32:21.970
- Where are the gallon jugs?
- I don't know.

32:22.448 --> 32:24.328
- God!
- What?

32:24.987 --> 32:27.511
Let's just take this.
Come on. Come on.

32:37.348 --> 32:39.427
What the hell are you doing
opening the door?

32:39.447 --> 32:42.111
How are we going to
take this thing out?

33:20.384 --> 33:22.893
- How is it going to be any different?
- Can I just try it?

33:22.971 --> 33:25.456
- Fine, fine, go ahead.
- Jesus. Okay.

33:27.069 --> 33:28.028
All right.

33:34.413 --> 33:37.392
Yeah, baby. See?
Eat it, okay?

33:37.417 --> 33:39.421
I'm the king.
I'm the king.

33:42.794 --> 33:45.368
No, no, no.
That didn't sound good.

33:51.293 --> 33:53.460
Well, this thing's
not going anywhere.

33:53.480 --> 33:57.176
We're not cooking in my damn driveway.
I tell you that.

34:04.458 --> 34:06.922
What part of slow it down
did you not understand?

34:06.942 --> 34:10.668
You talk too much. It's heavy, man.
You got to wait for me.

34:11.562 --> 34:12.514
Okay.

34:13.043 --> 34:15.728
That's good, that's good.
Now just bring it up.

34:17.016 --> 34:18.456
Easy, easy, easy.

34:18.822 --> 34:19.844
Okay.

34:20.328 --> 34:23.848
Your real estate agent,
when is she supposed to come back?

34:24.199 --> 34:25.388
Shit.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.697
Yo, I don't know.

34:28.009 --> 34:30.192
I'll make damn sure
she doesn't.

34:32.744 --> 34:34.668
Good call, yo.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.012
All right.

35:07.549 --> 35:11.213
Keep the temperature steady
at 425 degrees.

35:11.885 --> 35:14.318
We'll need to run it
two more hours

35:14.338 --> 35:16.659
to have enough
to make 4½ pounds.

35:16.980 --> 35:19.188
4½? Not 4?

35:19.283 --> 35:21.486
2 pounds pays Tuco back.

35:22.691 --> 35:26.679
4½ pounds puts us
$44,000 ahead...

35:26.981 --> 35:27.919
each.

35:27.968 --> 35:29.583
Right on, man.

35:30.511 --> 35:31.697
Right on.

35:31.748 --> 35:34.542
With the amount of methylamine
that we got last night,

35:34.618 --> 35:37.365
we could make
4½ pounds a week for...

35:37.835 --> 35:40.477
well, for the foreseeable future.

35:41.859 --> 35:44.673
How long is
that going to be?

35:45.128 --> 35:47.841
I mean in your situation.

35:48.717 --> 35:50.863
How much
cash do you need?

35:52.707 --> 35:53.905
More.

35:59.778 --> 36:01.494
Someone's in my yard.

36:28.591 --> 36:32.581
Was there, by any chance, scheduled
for this afternoon an open house?

36:33.567 --> 36:36.189
I left them a message, man.
It's not my fault.

36:36.209 --> 36:39.522
I don't care how you do it. Just keep
them out of here. Do you understand?

36:39.560 --> 36:41.369
- Yeah.
- Go.

37:10.844 --> 37:12.888
You know you can't
duck me forever.

37:12.996 --> 37:13.867
What?

37:14.407 --> 37:16.930
Come on. I left you,
like, 15 messages.

37:17.020 --> 37:19.356
When I went to your office,
you snuck out the back way.

37:19.376 --> 37:22.643
I didn't sneak.
I was going to lunch.

37:22.731 --> 37:25.557
Jeez, Skyler, what are you,
the paranoid police?

37:25.762 --> 37:29.079
Marie, I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

37:31.819 --> 37:33.687
That tiara.

37:35.012 --> 37:39.000
They accused me at Zachary's
of shoplifting it.

37:39.336 --> 37:41.570
What were you doing
at Zachary's?

37:42.391 --> 37:44.006
I was returning it.

37:45.019 --> 37:46.950
You were returning it.

37:48.269 --> 37:49.838
Why would you return it?

37:49.875 --> 37:51.182
It just wasn't...

37:52.383 --> 37:55.138
Marie, what is wrong with you?

37:55.158 --> 37:56.677
Can you please tell me that?

37:56.697 --> 37:59.693
Can you tell me why
you'd do such a thing?

38:03.563 --> 38:06.781
What does that mean?
Does that mean you don't know?

38:07.086 --> 38:09.964
That means that

38:10.213 --> 38:13.572
I have no idea what the hell
you're even talking about.

38:13.678 --> 38:16.717
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

38:16.856 --> 38:20.417
The shop...
The shoplifting.

38:20.945 --> 38:22.081
No idea?

38:24.503 --> 38:27.341
You're not going
to admit this, are you?

38:28.998 --> 38:32.340
I can't really admit to something

38:32.360 --> 38:36.183
when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

38:55.474 --> 38:57.464
Don't forget to sign in.

39:03.463 --> 39:05.205
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

39:23.546 --> 39:26.159
Excuse me. I'd just like
to see the basement.

39:26.245 --> 39:28.822
- Yeah, well, it's occupied.
- It's not a bathroom.

39:29.501 --> 39:32.188
I just want to see the basement.
What's the big deal?

39:32.549 --> 39:35.691
Yo, you ain't seeing
the basement, bitch. You got that?

39:35.711 --> 39:37.720
Is that sinking in?
Now beat it.

39:37.782 --> 39:40.243
All of you all.
House is not for sale.

39:40.502 --> 39:42.167
Get the hell out!

40:27.035 --> 40:28.574
So how was it?

40:29.181 --> 40:30.455
Was it a...

40:31.143 --> 40:32.891
an experience?

40:33.427 --> 40:34.310
Yeah.

40:34.951 --> 40:37.234
It was definitely
an experience.

40:44.063 --> 40:45.680
What's that smell?

40:47.582 --> 40:48.933
Yeah. It's...

40:49.843 --> 40:52.265
sacred Navajo herbs and...

41:07.028 --> 41:09.409
Hey,
is everything okay?

41:10.489 --> 41:12.899
No. Not really.

41:15.305 --> 41:17.261
Actually, not at all.

41:20.208 --> 41:23.805
You know that tiara
that Marie gave us?

41:23.880 --> 41:24.827
Yeah.

41:25.419 --> 41:27.703
Well, she stole it.

41:28.640 --> 41:29.586
Yeah.

41:29.840 --> 41:33.436
I practically got arrested
trying to return it at the store.

41:34.106 --> 41:35.416
Oh, my God.

41:35.508 --> 41:39.351
She refuses to admit it.
She refuses to apologize.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.421
I don't know
what to do.

41:46.078 --> 41:47.151
Oh, well.

41:48.437 --> 41:51.831
People sometimes do things
for their families.

41:54.351 --> 41:57.646
People sometimes do things
for their families?

41:58.124 --> 42:00.686
And, what,
that justifies stealing?

42:02.359 --> 42:03.383
Yeah.

42:05.112 --> 42:07.674
That must have
been some sweat lodge.

42:08.762 --> 42:12.443
Have you been listening
to the words coming out of your mouth?

42:15.468 --> 42:18.244
What would you do
if it were me?

42:20.657 --> 42:22.903
What do you mean
if it were you?

42:23.581 --> 42:25.978
If it were me,
what would you do?

42:26.507 --> 42:30.122
Would you divorce me?
Would you turn me in to the police?

42:40.522 --> 42:42.638
You don't want to find out.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.067
Do you want
something to eat?

42:59.933 --> 43:01.586
No, thanks.

43:18.001 --> 43:20.298
What is this shit?
This is blue.

43:22.298 --> 43:26.172
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

43:26.621 --> 43:29.283
It may be blue,
but it's the bomb.

43:37.385 --> 43:39.315
Tight! Tight, tight, yeah!

43:40.626 --> 43:42.305
Blue, yellow, pink.

43:42.629 --> 43:45.330
Whatever, man.
Just keep bringing me that.

43:54.818 --> 43:55.941
4.6.

43:57.864 --> 43:58.911
Come on.

44:00.424 --> 44:03.339
And what did I say, man?
This guy can cook!

44:03.811 --> 44:05.926
You're all right, man.
You're all right.

44:05.946 --> 44:08.763
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

44:09.601 --> 44:12.137
Just remember
who you're working for.

44:15.066 --> 44:16.556
What did you say?

44:17.353 --> 44:20.596
I'm just saying they got to know
that they're working for you.

44:20.680 --> 44:23.341
Like they don't
already know that?

44:23.846 --> 44:26.218
Are you saying
that they're stupid?

44:27.578 --> 44:29.888
No, I'm just...
I'm just saying.

44:30.385 --> 44:32.909
Oh, yeah. So you're not
saying that they're stupid.

44:32.973 --> 44:36.061
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

44:36.102 --> 44:38.763
No. Come on, Tuco.
I'm just saying.

44:38.783 --> 44:41.040
No, you're just
speaking for me!

44:41.090 --> 44:44.850
Like I ain't got the damn sense
to speak for myself!

44:45.700 --> 44:48.513
Is that it? Is that
what you're doing?

44:49.242 --> 44:50.085
Tuco.

44:53.866 --> 44:57.475
Hey, why don't we
all just relax, huh?

45:04.864 --> 45:07.173
Heisenberg says relax.

45:09.339 --> 45:11.043
Orale, homes.

45:13.982 --> 45:15.295
I'm relaxed.

45:15.345 --> 45:17.580
I'm relaxed.
I'm relaxed.

45:34.496 --> 45:36.798
Damn, man!
Look at that! Look!

45:39.531 --> 45:41.802
Yeah. That's messed up.

45:43.811 --> 45:45.538
Okay, Heisenberg!

45:46.405 --> 45:47.730
Next week.
