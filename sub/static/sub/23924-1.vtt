Previously on "Mr. Pickles"...

00:01.913 --> 00:03.812
It's Steve in the picture!

00:03.870 --> 00:05.438
- Who?
- You know, Steve,

00:05.471 --> 00:07.707
the guardian of Mr. Pickles' lair.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.109
Ugh! Aah!

00:09.631 --> 00:10.844
My wife, Agnes,

00:10.877 --> 00:13.575
passed away years ago.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.682
- Where is she?
- Aah!

00:15.716 --> 00:17.851
An underground city?

00:17.885 --> 00:19.319
- Mr. Pickles!
- Ah!

00:19.353 --> 00:21.137
Where's Agnes?!

00:22.054 --> 00:24.658
Hello, Henry.

00:28.161 --> 00:30.305
Aah!

00:31.163 --> 00:34.300
Aah! No, Agnes, get off of me!

00:34.333 --> 00:36.875
I told you, my name is Steve,

00:36.954 --> 00:38.814
and where do you think you're going,
Henry?!

00:38.880 --> 00:41.141
To tell everybody the truth!

00:48.493 --> 00:51.237
Everybody,
you're not gonna believe this, but...

00:51.303 --> 00:54.807
Dad, wait!
You're not gonna believe this.

00:54.887 --> 00:57.523
- Wha...
- Mom is alive!

01:19.349 --> 01:22.415
Mom, tell the doctor what you told us.

01:22.449 --> 01:27.054
All I remember is that dumb
kid finding me outside.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.789
I'm Tommy!

01:28.822 --> 01:31.257
She remembers. Mr. Pickles killed her,

01:31.290 --> 01:33.293
then revived her just to mess with me.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.507
She's Steve, Mr. Pickles' pet

01:35.586 --> 01:37.513
who lives under the dog hou... Oh! Aah!

01:37.579 --> 01:40.434
Oopsie. Maybe I was a clumsy person,

01:40.467 --> 01:42.269
but I don't remember.

01:42.301 --> 01:43.470
Well, it seems

01:43.503 --> 01:45.539
your mother is not dead.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.775
Oh, and she has amnesia.

01:47.807 --> 01:48.875
Amnesia?

01:48.908 --> 01:50.777
Well, I think I'll go clean the gutters.

01:50.810 --> 01:51.778
Stanley!

01:51.812 --> 01:53.980
You haven't said a word to mom.

01:54.013 --> 01:56.877
Oh, uh, Agnes, hi.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.553
Hey,
maybe this place can help her remember!

01:59.586 --> 02:02.289
It can recover and
record memories for free!

02:02.322 --> 02:04.591
- Huh?
- Great, then we can all see

02:04.623 --> 02:07.327
where Agnes has really been!

02:12.131 --> 02:14.634
Wow! Oh.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.670
Well, I'm gonna go buy some new socks.

02:16.702 --> 02:19.672
Hi, folks!
I'm Ace, the manager here at M,

02:19.706 --> 02:21.308
The Memory Download Store!

02:21.340 --> 02:23.643
What if you could remember where
you put that wig of yours?!

02:23.677 --> 02:25.813
Or want to prove to mom
you did brush your teeth?

02:25.845 --> 02:27.914
Maybe you just want to watch
some old memories to remember

02:27.947 --> 02:30.094
why you ever got married, all for free?

02:30.160 --> 02:33.119
Who's down to download today, hmm?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.321
- My grandma!
- Uh...

02:34.354 --> 02:36.255
But she has amnesty!

02:36.289 --> 02:37.925
Amnesia? Forget about it.

02:37.957 --> 02:40.493
M's process even
downloads lost memories.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.495
- It's going down... load.
- Wait.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.667
Stop, boy! He's going down on grandma!

02:46.700 --> 02:49.369
And boo-yah! Her memories are recovered!

02:49.403 --> 02:50.604
Yay!

02:50.636 --> 02:52.372
Now we can watch her memories!

02:52.405 --> 02:55.148
But some memories should be private,

02:55.227 --> 02:57.536
even if I don't remember anything.

02:57.615 --> 03:00.546
That's right!
Everybody is hiding shameful memories,

03:00.580 --> 03:03.149
so I'm gonna upload all
her shameful memories

03:03.183 --> 03:04.618
online for the world to see.

03:04.650 --> 03:08.287
Unless you pay me $50,000
by the end of the day!

03:08.320 --> 03:10.656
- What?
- You're blackmailing us?

03:10.689 --> 03:13.526
Yeah, you and everybody else.

03:13.559 --> 03:16.233
Oh, no! The whole town is in trouble!

03:16.299 --> 03:18.531
Don't worry, grandma,
I know who can help.

03:18.564 --> 03:20.300
Come on, Mr. Pickles!

03:22.687 --> 03:23.837
Oh, Tommy.

03:23.869 --> 03:27.640
I thought you were the
delivery guy bringing me fish.

03:27.673 --> 03:29.642
- Fish?
- No, thanks, Blade.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.545
I know you're good at computers,

03:31.577 --> 03:33.247
and I need your help!

03:33.591 --> 03:36.315
M has set up operations nationwide.

03:36.349 --> 03:39.053
These guys are the best hackers alive,

03:39.132 --> 03:41.721
but I could hack into Ace's computer

03:41.755 --> 03:44.391
and delete his memory files remotely.

03:44.423 --> 03:45.759
- Fish?
- No, thanks.

03:45.791 --> 03:48.472
You hear that?
He can delete the memories.

03:48.577 --> 03:50.880
Oh, no. He's coded each file,

03:50.913 --> 03:54.083
so that, to delete them,
I would have to download them

03:54.117 --> 03:56.553
back into their original brains.

03:56.585 --> 04:00.856
Sorry, I cannot help y-y-y-y-y-you.

04:00.889 --> 04:04.727
Lewis! I told you to stop
buying all these fish online!

04:04.761 --> 04:06.897
They're clogging up the toilet!

04:07.184 --> 04:10.032
Grandma, I told you to call me Blade.

04:10.066 --> 04:12.236
When are you gonna give
up this hacker thing

04:12.268 --> 04:13.736
and grow up, Lewis?

04:13.769 --> 04:17.240
What a cunt-tinuously annoying woman.

04:17.274 --> 04:18.442
Fish?

04:18.474 --> 04:20.409
No, thanks. Come on, boy.

04:21.611 --> 04:23.946
Oh, wait.

04:25.115 --> 04:26.928
What are we doing?

04:27.007 --> 04:29.886
I will download the
files into your brain,

04:29.918 --> 04:33.889
thus deleting the memories
from Ace's computer.

04:33.923 --> 04:35.959
The files are deleting.

04:35.991 --> 04:38.894
When you're good, you are good.

04:38.928 --> 04:41.932
Sir, what are you doing?

04:41.964 --> 04:44.857
I don't want to know that!
Ow, my head's hurting!

04:45.319 --> 04:47.204
My head, stop!

04:47.236 --> 04:50.273
Stopping mid-transfer
could cause brain failure.

04:50.307 --> 04:53.810
It must be stopped from
the original source.

04:53.842 --> 04:55.278
Fish?

04:55.312 --> 04:56.913
Hey, we got your money!

04:56.945 --> 04:58.614
Hey, what the hell's
happening to my computer?

04:58.647 --> 05:00.284
Why are my files deleting?

05:00.317 --> 05:02.386
Hey, what do you want, you stupid dog?

05:02.418 --> 05:03.620
Hey, what are you... No!

05:03.652 --> 05:06.123
Hey, you broke my computer!

05:10.360 --> 05:15.132
Error, error,
now transferring entire M database.

05:17.267 --> 05:19.136
Ace, what's happening to your computer?

05:19.168 --> 05:21.238
All of M's memory files are deleting

05:21.271 --> 05:23.807
and being transferred
into some kid's brain!

05:23.839 --> 05:25.409
You're the only hacker alive

05:25.442 --> 05:26.942
who knows how to get the memories

05:26.976 --> 05:29.478
out of that kid! Ace?!

05:35.161 --> 05:37.788
Oh, no. It's rapidly downloading

05:37.820 --> 05:39.822
the entire country's memories.

05:39.856 --> 05:42.692
I know too much!

05:45.394 --> 05:46.863
Are you okay?

05:47.348 --> 05:50.300
Uhh, I think so.

05:50.712 --> 05:53.169
And then, when I was 16,

05:53.202 --> 05:56.138
I wanted to be a ventriloquist,
but you said,

05:56.171 --> 05:58.808
"If you're looking for a dummy,
just look in the mirror."

05:58.841 --> 06:01.377
- Oh!
- We didn't always get along.

06:01.411 --> 06:03.512
Now we have a second chance.

06:03.546 --> 06:06.149
Oh! I wish I could remember.

06:06.182 --> 06:08.518
- She remembers!
- Well, I'm gonna...

06:08.550 --> 06:10.053
Hey, look, a spoon store.

06:10.086 --> 06:11.655
Stanley, what is up with you?!

06:11.687 --> 06:12.889
♪ La la la, spoons ♪

06:12.921 --> 06:15.191
They'll never believe you, Henry!

06:15.224 --> 06:16.859
Mr. Pickles showed me

06:16.892 --> 06:19.495
the way of the pavanastra
sluganotharats.

06:19.529 --> 06:22.666
I am forever Steve,
and now that I'm home,

06:22.699 --> 06:25.202
I'm gonna help Mr. Pickles
make your life hell!

06:28.325 --> 06:30.039
Ugh, who cares?

06:30.072 --> 06:32.575
You want to make me look crazy?
I'm used to it.

06:34.538 --> 06:36.713
Oh! Hey, what are you doing?

06:36.745 --> 06:39.882
Help! He's forcing himself on me!

06:39.916 --> 06:42.986
- What?
- Dad! This has gone too far!

06:43.019 --> 06:44.388
Oh.

06:44.421 --> 06:46.055
Oh, no, I'm stuck!

06:46.089 --> 06:49.192
Now I'll never stop the
town from being blackmailed.

06:49.224 --> 06:51.327
- Aww.
- Lewis, I told you not

06:51.361 --> 06:53.897
to put fish in my waterbed anymore!

06:53.930 --> 06:56.400
That's it, you're moving out!

06:56.433 --> 06:58.932
Aww. Wait.

06:59.269 --> 07:00.737
Let's move out!

07:00.769 --> 07:04.407
Oh! Whoa!

07:04.440 --> 07:06.909
Aah! Lewis, get back here

07:06.942 --> 07:09.111
with my house!

07:18.555 --> 07:22.591
- Blade! Watch out!
- Huh? Oh!

07:23.152 --> 07:24.261
Speeders!

07:24.293 --> 07:26.363
Oh, no, the po-po.

07:26.396 --> 07:27.697
Hold on.

07:33.135 --> 07:34.270
Aah!

07:34.303 --> 07:38.240
You in the house!
Slow down, or I will shoot!

07:38.274 --> 07:41.245
I can't see with this
stupid sign in the way!

07:45.981 --> 07:47.284
Oh, no, a dead end!

07:47.564 --> 07:50.487
- Slow down!
- Rock and roll.

07:52.354 --> 07:54.757
- Hey, I got your money!
- $50,000!

07:54.791 --> 07:56.459
Where the hell is he?

07:56.493 --> 07:58.661
- Oh!
- Whoa!

08:01.163 --> 08:02.798
- Tommy?
- Tommy?

08:02.832 --> 08:04.267
Hi, everybody!

08:04.300 --> 08:06.303
I've downloaded all of
the memories into my brain

08:06.336 --> 08:08.839
so nobody has to be blackmailed.

08:08.872 --> 08:12.175
Yeah, Tommy! Our memories are safe!

08:13.442 --> 08:16.275
That's right!
Some things should be private,

08:16.328 --> 08:18.819
'cause if they weren't,
everybody would know

08:18.872 --> 08:22.313
Mr. BoJenkins wears women's
clothes and spanks himself.

08:22.366 --> 08:25.154
The sheriff was a kid who
dressed his poops up like dolls.

08:25.187 --> 08:26.990
- Aww.
- And my grandma laid naked

08:27.022 --> 08:28.591
with my dad.

08:28.625 --> 08:32.261
Also, where my grandma has
really been all these years

08:32.294 --> 08:36.030
is with...

08:36.679 --> 08:40.001
Oh. What was I saying?

08:40.969 --> 08:42.873
Well, maybe I'll go get a haircut.

08:42.905 --> 08:45.675
You laid naked with my mother?!

08:45.893 --> 08:48.377
Uh, it was dark.
Your mother crawled into bed.

08:48.411 --> 08:50.546
But I knew it wasn't
you when I smelled...

08:50.579 --> 08:52.849
- Fish?
- Uh, no thanks.

08:52.882 --> 08:54.885
Is this true?

08:54.917 --> 08:56.685
Oh, of course it's true!

08:57.434 --> 08:59.990
But when I tried to screw Stanley,

09:00.022 --> 09:03.192
he acted like his
family was so important!

09:03.225 --> 09:05.828
Ha! His stupid dreamer of a wife

09:05.862 --> 09:07.831
and his idiot son!

09:07.863 --> 09:10.700
Yay, grandma remembers me!

09:10.733 --> 09:12.469
- Agnes, how could you...
- Henry!

09:12.502 --> 09:14.905
I told you to call me St...

09:14.938 --> 09:18.808
Oh! I've gotten carried away.
Don't be mad.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.476
How could I not be mad?

09:20.509 --> 09:22.711
No, don't kill me.

09:22.744 --> 09:25.581
I'll do anything you want! Anythi...

09:25.614 --> 09:27.650
Oh, Agnes!

09:27.684 --> 09:29.553
- Mom!
- Delivery for Blade?

09:29.585 --> 09:31.887
Boy, this place was hard to find. Oh!

09:33.722 --> 09:35.392
Now she's dead.

09:35.425 --> 09:36.993
Ugh!

09:37.026 --> 09:39.329
What's happening? I can't see.

09:41.397 --> 09:43.733
But destroying this is pointless.

09:43.766 --> 09:45.168
I've backed up all the memories

09:45.200 --> 09:47.937
on the M satellite in outer space.

09:53.632 --> 09:56.798
Mr. Pickles, I've got a bone to pick...

09:57.220 --> 09:58.748
Agnes?

09:58.781 --> 10:01.851
Henry, I'm sorry I hurt you,

10:01.883 --> 10:04.353
but I'll always remember the time

10:04.387 --> 10:05.854
we made wild love

10:05.887 --> 10:08.458
in the back of your '57 Chevy.

10:09.290 --> 10:11.394
I never had a '57 Chevy.

10:11.426 --> 10:12.962
Oops, I wonder who that was.

10:12.996 --> 10:14.598
Well, bye, Henry.

10:14.631 --> 10:17.033
Huh? What the hell?

10:25.807 --> 10:27.443
Oh, Agnes!

10:27.477 --> 10:29.980
More Steves?

10:30.012 --> 10:33.282
What happened today? Where's grandma?

10:33.315 --> 10:36.820
She's going to a better place, Tommy.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.320
Look, a shooting star!

10:38.353 --> 10:41.391
- Where?
- Maybe that's your grandma.

10:45.460 --> 10:48.430
Man, this is the weirdest memory yet.

10:48.464 --> 10:51.300
No, don't kill me.
I'll do anything, anything.

10:51.334 --> 10:53.502
Hey, what the hell is that?
