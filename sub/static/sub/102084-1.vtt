WEBVTT

00:25.991 --> 00:27.491
Since I can remember,

00:27.525 --> 00:29.825
I've always been a bit of a
romantic.

00:31.825 --> 00:33.426
I'm not exactly sure
when it started for me

00:33.491 --> 00:35.426
but it was pretty telling that
as a child,

00:35.491 --> 00:37.324
my imaginary friend was a wife.

00:39.426 --> 00:42.224
Now that I say that out loud,
I realize how weird that is.

00:42.491 --> 00:45.525
Anyway, then I met Emily.

00:46.558 --> 00:51.024
My dreams took on form
and love became a reality.

00:53.991 --> 00:58.158
From that moment on, I knew
she was going to be my wife.

00:59.324 --> 01:00.658
Fight, fight, fight!

01:00.691 --> 01:02.291
But then a pubescent
tyrant

01:02.324 --> 01:05.158
by the name of Ricky Moore
tried to steal her from me.

01:05.224 --> 01:08.091
I had no choice but to
protect my soulmate.

01:08.124 --> 01:10.890
So here I was, surrounded by an
angry mob

01:10.892 --> 01:14.291
of abnormally bloodthirsty
juveniles and what does she do?

01:18.258 --> 01:21.324
She drops my heart on the ground
like it's a piece of trash.

01:29.725 --> 01:31.792
Now can we go to your
house and play Nintendo?

01:31.825 --> 01:33.222
My best friend Lawrence has
always

01:33.224 --> 01:35.224
been there to get me up off
the ground and you know,

01:35.258 --> 01:36.989
even though Emily broke my
heart,

01:36.991 --> 01:39.458
she helped me realize my perfect
girl

01:39.491 --> 01:42.725
was going to be loyal
and so began the list.

01:42.758 --> 01:44.491
I'd been able to learn so much
over

01:44.558 --> 01:46.890
the years about who my
perfect girl will be.

01:46.892 --> 01:48.991
There was Hailey, who
had a really big heart

01:49.057 --> 01:50.725
but there just wasn't any room
for dogs.

01:50.758 --> 01:53.723
She taught me that my
perfect girl will like dogs.

01:53.725 --> 01:56.558
And then Nicole, I mean she
could talk about anything.

01:56.591 --> 01:58.989
We had some of the deepest
conversations

01:58.991 --> 02:01.491
but she didn't actually
want to do anything.

02:01.525 --> 02:05.057
Boom, my perfect girl will be
adventurous.

02:05.124 --> 02:06.359
Which brings me to Katy.

02:07.892 --> 02:10.024
We would do something new every
weekend

02:10.057 --> 02:11.989
with Lawrence and his
girlfriend Christine,

02:11.991 --> 02:13.790
who happened to be Katy's best
friend.

02:13.792 --> 02:15.691
She was loyal and she liked dogs

02:15.725 --> 02:20.325
and she was great to talk
to, but then this happened.

02:20.359 --> 02:24.792
Just when you think you've hit
a home run, you strike out.

02:25.792 --> 02:27.391
Sorry, Katy.

02:27.458 --> 02:29.691
My perfect girl will like
baseball.

02:33.391 --> 02:35.691
And look, I get it, it might
seem like I'm being way

02:35.725 --> 02:39.292
too picky and I'm never going
to find the perfect girl,

02:39.325 --> 02:40.991
but I refuse to lose hope.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.458
I believe she's out there
somewhere

02:45.892 --> 02:47.858
and I'm not giving up until I
find her.

03:08.858 --> 03:11.292
Hi, how can I help you?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.792
I need a photographer

03:12.858 --> 03:15.989
and I was told you're
the best in the city.

03:15.991 --> 03:18.391
That's if your name is Thomas
McKenzie.

03:18.425 --> 03:22.523
It's my lucky day, I am Thomas
McKenzie.

03:22.525 --> 03:24.525
- What's your name?
- Hope Sanchez.

03:24.558 --> 03:25.858
Nice to meet you, Hope.

03:26.691 --> 03:29.792
- You took all of these?
- I did.

03:29.858 --> 03:32.091
Yeah, I figured it'd be a little
awkward

03:32.124 --> 03:34.691
if I had someone else's work on
display.

03:34.725 --> 03:39.358
Oh, look how cute,
that face, is he yours?

03:39.391 --> 03:41.625
Yeah, yeah, that's Boomer.

03:42.558 --> 03:46.725
We grew up together, best dog
that ever lived, hands down.

03:47.892 --> 03:49.259
It was actually that photo that

03:49.291 --> 03:50.856
inspired me to become a
photographer.

03:50.858 --> 03:52.358
Really?

03:52.391 --> 03:55.124
It captured his personality so
well.

03:57.525 --> 03:59.689
- So are you a dog person, Hope?
- I am.

03:59.691 --> 04:02.291
Growing up, we always
had a dog running around.

04:02.324 --> 04:05.024
- They just make life better.
- They do, right?

04:05.091 --> 04:06.691
- They really do.
- Yeah.

04:06.758 --> 04:08.756
So, what's your dog's name?

04:08.758 --> 04:12.391
I actually don't have
a dog, we just moved in,

04:12.458 --> 04:14.989
unpacking boxes but I
specifically

04:14.991 --> 04:17.491
rented a place that allows for
pets.

04:17.525 --> 04:20.991
So does your roommate like
dogs?

04:21.024 --> 04:24.192
Yes, my daughter takes after
me.

04:24.258 --> 04:27.091
We are softies when it comes to
big,

04:27.124 --> 04:30.589
sad puppy dog eyes staring at
us.

04:30.591 --> 04:32.159
It just makes my heart melt.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.024
I completely understand.

04:38.758 --> 04:40.625
You took these?

04:40.658 --> 04:41.989
- Yeah.
- Where was that?

04:41.991 --> 04:44.458
These were actually
a trip I took to Kenya.

04:44.491 --> 04:47.159
We were there helping
to build an orphanage.

04:47.192 --> 04:48.758
You have really good eyes.

04:49.991 --> 04:51.691
I mean you have a really good
eye,

04:51.758 --> 04:54.491
you're a photographer and you're
great.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.425
Did you take that one too?

05:01.825 --> 05:04.991
No, that's Mike Trout's famous
catch.

05:05.024 --> 05:06.758
Oh, I was recently told that
it

05:06.825 --> 05:09.358
was weird to display another
person's photography.

05:09.391 --> 05:10.658
Okay,

05:10.691 --> 05:14.989
touche, I admit I did not take
the photo,

05:14.991 --> 05:16.658
but I was at the game.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.858
I'm sorry, I'm not a baseball
fan.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.489
No?

05:29.491 --> 05:30.491
Not even a little bit?

05:30.525 --> 05:34.491
No, there's too much
spitting and scratching.

05:37.425 --> 05:38.258
Yeah.

05:39.425 --> 05:40.991
So, you need a photographer.

05:47.158 --> 05:48.425
All right, well it
was a pleasure meeting you.

05:48.491 --> 05:50.191
- I'll see you at the shoot.
- Yeah.

05:55.991 --> 05:56.825
What?

05:58.092 --> 06:01.324
T-man, who was that fine looking
woman?

06:01.391 --> 06:03.057
Tell me you got her number.

06:03.092 --> 06:06.125
Yep, and her email address.

06:06.158 --> 06:08.291
She scheduled us for a shoot.

06:08.324 --> 06:11.224
No ring on her finger,
five foot perfect.

06:11.258 --> 06:12.725
What's your next move, Romeo?

06:14.792 --> 06:15.991
What, nothing?

06:16.058 --> 06:17.258
You've gotta be kidding me.

06:17.291 --> 06:19.890
How can you not be the least
bit interested in that?

06:19.892 --> 06:22.558
Number 23, she doesn't like
baseball.

06:26.558 --> 06:29.258
There are like 40 other
things on your list, man.

06:29.291 --> 06:31.558
Besides, who likes baseball
anyway?

06:33.658 --> 06:34.792
Who is this?

06:38.558 --> 06:39.458
I painted her.

06:42.224 --> 06:44.391
T-man, keeping a list
of qualities you want

06:44.425 --> 06:46.491
in a woman, even
sketching in your journal,

06:46.558 --> 06:48.989
that's one thing but a life-size
portrait

06:48.991 --> 06:51.825
of an imaginary woman, that's
just weird.

06:51.892 --> 06:53.658
She's not life-size.

06:53.725 --> 06:54.890
I think you missed my point.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.058
It's a creative outlet,
Lawrence.

06:57.091 --> 06:59.591
T-man, it's time you went
on a date or something.

06:59.625 --> 07:00.556
I date.

07:00.558 --> 07:03.792
I mean with a real woman, not
Betty.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.456
- Betty?
- She needed a name.

07:07.458 --> 07:08.324
It's not Betty.

07:08.358 --> 07:10.456
T-man, your mom has set up
more dates

07:10.458 --> 07:11.989
for you in the past year than
you have.

07:11.991 --> 07:14.324
Oh yeah, those are the
best moments of my life.

07:14.358 --> 07:16.790
Oh come on, what about Sherry?

07:16.792 --> 07:18.858
- Miss alcoholic?
- What about Amy?

07:18.892 --> 07:21.291
She asked me if Alaska was
tropical.

07:22.825 --> 07:23.691
What about Rebecca?

07:23.725 --> 07:25.358
Now she was fine.

07:25.391 --> 07:27.658
She brought a rabbit to the
date.

07:28.825 --> 07:31.391
A rabbit, a live rabbit.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.792
She was still fine.

07:34.792 --> 07:36.456
I gotta go make these
deliveries.

07:36.458 --> 07:38.122
Are we gettin' paid this week?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.525
Are you doing any work this
week?

07:39.558 --> 07:40.990
I'm serious man, are we
gettin' paid?

07:40.992 --> 07:42.158
Yeah, I'm serious too.

07:51.525 --> 07:55.491
Yeah, yeah, okay girlfriend,
we will see you in a bit.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.990
It's like God's perfect timing.

07:59.992 --> 08:01.224
How you feeling, how you
feeling?

08:01.258 --> 08:03.591
Oh, I'm so happy, I'm so
happy.

08:03.625 --> 08:06.691
♪ H-A-Double-P-Y, H-A-double-P-Y ♪

08:06.725 --> 08:10.091
♪ Bring it home, H-A-double-P-Y ♪

08:10.124 --> 08:10.992
You're here.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.022
Were you two just doing the
happy dance?

08:14.024 --> 08:14.858
No.

08:17.525 --> 08:20.725
Mother, why were you
doing the happy dance?

08:20.758 --> 08:21.892
Honey, would you do me a favor

08:21.992 --> 08:23.091
and just bring that out to your
dad?

08:23.124 --> 08:25.425
Thank you, oh here,
don't forget his banana.

08:30.591 --> 08:34.458
Hey Mr. Mac, you're
looking a little gray there.

08:34.525 --> 08:36.358
Hey, what size Depends do you
wear?

08:36.391 --> 08:37.856
Mr. Mac, how long does it take
you

08:37.858 --> 08:41.856
to shave your nose hair in
the morning and the afternoon?

08:41.858 --> 08:43.689
Are you not responding
'cause you can't hear me?

08:43.691 --> 08:45.091
Hey dad, mom sent you a
banana.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.989
Oh, need your potassium, Mr.
Mac?

08:57.191 --> 08:59.391
Now how about that man
bun?

08:59.425 --> 09:01.258
Anybody else thirsty?

09:02.258 --> 09:04.158
I'm gonna go get a drink, Mrs.
Mac?

09:06.258 --> 09:08.124
Something's wrong with that
kid.

09:08.158 --> 09:08.991
Who is that?

09:13.491 --> 09:14.991
Father,

09:15.024 --> 09:16.625
who is that?

09:16.658 --> 09:20.091
That's Grace, she's the
daughter of Bev's friend.

09:21.324 --> 09:24.625
The one your mother
invited to dinner tonight.

09:24.658 --> 09:25.991
You gotta be kidding me.

09:26.991 --> 09:29.989
Hey Thomas, I'm so glad you're
here.

09:29.991 --> 09:31.756
I've got a surprise for you.

09:31.758 --> 09:32.591
Et tu, Brute?

09:34.591 --> 09:37.591
I don't know what that means.

09:40.091 --> 09:43.358
Thomas wait, wait up,
don't go, Thomas, hold on.

09:43.425 --> 09:45.324
- You, I can't.
- Thomas, honey.

09:45.358 --> 09:47.423
No, no, no, no, no, mother...

09:47.425 --> 09:48.256
- No, don't go.
- I love you

09:48.258 --> 09:49.525
but you need a new hobby.

09:49.591 --> 09:51.758
Matchmaking is not one
of the spiritual gifts.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.291
- Thomas, hold on.
- No, I knew,

09:53.324 --> 09:55.458
I knew when you were
doing the happy dance.

09:58.258 --> 09:59.658
- I'm not staying.
- One sec.

10:02.091 --> 10:04.024
Hi, I am so sorry,

10:04.091 --> 10:06.658
my phone died, no GPS in the
car.

10:06.691 --> 10:08.792
- Hope?
- Thomas?

10:08.826 --> 10:10.957
- What are you doing here?
- Mommy.

10:10.991 --> 10:12.191
Hey.

10:12.258 --> 10:13.859
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.625
Well, you outdid yourself,
honey.

10:38.658 --> 10:39.924
Can you help me clear it?

10:42.625 --> 10:44.924
Oh no, no, no, no,
girlfriend, you are the guest.

10:44.957 --> 10:47.024
- No, we got this.
- Sweetheart.

10:47.091 --> 10:48.924
Gracie, let's go draw
pictures.

10:48.957 --> 10:51.024
It's happening right
in front of our eyes.

10:51.091 --> 10:52.491
Have fun.

10:52.525 --> 10:53.324
Honey.

10:53.358 --> 10:54.191
Gotta go.

10:55.191 --> 10:56.922
Lawrence.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.589
Wait for it.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.826
Can you help me with the
trash, please?

11:00.858 --> 11:01.826
Like clockwork.

11:04.558 --> 11:07.158
Excuse me, they are so good.

11:07.191 --> 11:08.858
Coming, Mrs. Mac.

11:10.525 --> 11:11.525
One last thing.

11:14.324 --> 11:17.691
Ah ha, just so you keep
the bugs away, you know?

11:22.691 --> 11:25.525
I'd like to apologize for my
family.

11:25.558 --> 11:28.057
It's okay, I'm used to it.

11:28.091 --> 11:30.425
Single mom and widow.

11:32.391 --> 11:35.725
I am so sorry, I had no idea.

11:35.759 --> 11:37.991
- It's okay.
- Oh my goodness.

11:39.258 --> 11:42.191
Well you know, my mother,
she thinks she's Yenta,

11:42.224 --> 11:43.425
so she really can't help
herself.

11:43.491 --> 11:46.091
♪ Matchmaker, matchmaker ♪

11:46.158 --> 11:47.091
I have learned to sneak out

11:47.158 --> 11:49.024
the back door as soon as
possible.

11:50.825 --> 11:51.991
But you're still here.

11:53.858 --> 11:54.858
Well, I can't leave you

11:54.892 --> 11:56.726
to fend for yourself with this
bunch.

11:57.558 --> 11:59.658
I think they're great.

11:59.691 --> 12:00.991
Eh, they're all right.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.224
They remind me of home.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.391
Where's that?

12:09.425 --> 12:10.989
San Antonio.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.222
Wow, well that's a
big move.

12:13.224 --> 12:14.991
- Yeah.
- What stirred it?

12:16.091 --> 12:19.158
Well, Texas was...

12:22.491 --> 12:24.091
I just needed a change.

12:24.124 --> 12:25.792
Meet new people, escape the
pity.

12:30.991 --> 12:33.291
- Hey, Gracie girl.
- Look who it is.

12:33.324 --> 12:34.491
What's this?

12:34.558 --> 12:38.458
I drew a picture of me at
the circus for Mrs. Kenzie.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.391
- That's great.
- Wow.

12:40.425 --> 12:43.890
Hey, this is great, when
did you go to the circus?

12:43.892 --> 12:45.491
I didn't go to the circus.

12:45.558 --> 12:47.892
We talk about going
all the time and although

12:47.991 --> 12:52.291
we can't go, we do have a book
that Gracie loves to read.

12:52.324 --> 12:54.124
"Olivia Saves the Circus."

12:54.158 --> 12:56.258
Well I am sure Mrs. McKenzie
is going

12:56.291 --> 12:59.258
to love this picture,
wanna go take it to her?

12:59.291 --> 13:00.458
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

13:01.892 --> 13:04.191
- Movie, catch it.
- Four words.

13:04.224 --> 13:05.558
- First word.
- First word.

13:05.625 --> 13:06.458
Time.

13:08.358 --> 13:09.191
Hitchhike.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.158
Thumbs up, crafts.

13:13.858 --> 13:15.525
So how long have you
two been friends for?

13:15.558 --> 13:17.858
I've been taking care of
my boy since kindergarten.

13:17.892 --> 13:19.224
Kinda like Batman and Robin.

13:19.291 --> 13:23.124
Second word, second word.

13:23.158 --> 13:24.858
Wow, you're really blessed

13:24.892 --> 13:27.024
to have that sort of friendship.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.391
- Interstate.
- Two, two.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.691
So, do you like dogs?

13:31.725 --> 13:33.191
I do.

13:33.224 --> 13:34.525
Hiking?

13:34.558 --> 13:35.659
Not really.

13:36.525 --> 13:37.659
Where'd you go to school?

13:39.458 --> 13:41.124
Undergrad or grad?

13:41.158 --> 13:42.358
Grad.

13:42.391 --> 13:44.659
Xavier's School for the
Gifted.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.191
What's your mutant power?

13:48.458 --> 13:49.626
I can tell the future.

13:50.725 --> 13:53.456
Yeah right, what's gonna
happen next?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.456
- Hitchhiking.
- Dessert.

13:55.458 --> 13:57.659
- Time, time, time.
- Dessert.

13:59.224 --> 14:01.989
- "Back to the Future."
- Thank you.

14:01.991 --> 14:02.792
What?

14:03.991 --> 14:07.626
Man, you are not good at this
game.

14:07.691 --> 14:09.558
Finally got one.

14:09.592 --> 14:12.758
Okay, all right, babe, this
one's just for you and me.

14:12.792 --> 14:16.858
All right, this one's
just for you, all right?

14:16.892 --> 14:18.091
- Four words.
- No, no, no.

14:18.124 --> 14:21.057
Just Bev, just Bev, all right.

14:21.091 --> 14:23.022
Okay, four words.

14:23.024 --> 14:25.525
- It's a quote though.
- Just Bev, just Bev.

14:27.758 --> 14:28.592
It's a quote.

14:30.224 --> 14:31.091
First word

14:32.124 --> 14:32.991
sounds like

14:37.291 --> 14:39.291
eatin' some grapes.

14:40.559 --> 14:41.391
Gulpin'.

14:42.758 --> 14:43.792
The girl is a comic book fan.

14:44.991 --> 14:46.258
- Pills?
- I mean she likes DC but

14:46.291 --> 14:48.856
she at least has a working
knowledge of the Marvel Universe.

14:48.858 --> 14:50.559
- That's not even on the list.
- No, but it should be.

14:50.592 --> 14:52.856
Can he do that, dad?

14:52.858 --> 14:54.358
Get on a plane.

14:56.358 --> 14:58.358
Will you, okay, fourth word.

14:59.991 --> 15:00.758
Mark.

15:02.024 --> 15:04.858
Sounds like knee, knee, knee,
knee.

15:05.792 --> 15:07.425
Come on, our third word.

15:07.458 --> 15:08.825
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Come on.

15:08.858 --> 15:10.989
A marching, a bride,

15:10.991 --> 15:13.425
a wedding, a bride,

15:13.458 --> 15:15.658
marriage, marry, marry,
ooh, will you marry me?

15:17.825 --> 15:18.756
Will you marry me?

15:18.758 --> 15:21.458
Well gosh Bev, I
thought you'd never ask.

15:27.258 --> 15:28.091
Bev,

15:29.792 --> 15:30.691
will you marry me?

15:32.991 --> 15:33.991
- Of course.
- Yes?

15:37.024 --> 15:38.658
Yes, come here.

15:38.691 --> 15:42.591
She said yes.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.291
Mom, I'm so happy!

15:45.991 --> 15:46.792
Dad!

15:47.825 --> 15:49.589
You can't get rid of me now.

15:49.591 --> 15:51.591
Can't get rid of me now.

15:53.458 --> 15:54.989
Hey, you'll be my best man,
right?

15:54.991 --> 15:56.358
I mean there's nobody else that

15:56.425 --> 15:58.526
I'd rather have stand next to me
than you.

15:59.425 --> 16:01.391
I'd be honored to.

16:01.425 --> 16:02.825
- I'm happy for you, man.
- Thanks.

16:02.858 --> 16:05.024
My Maid of Honor.

16:05.057 --> 16:06.658
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

16:07.558 --> 16:10.057
Ah man, that was terrifying.

16:11.991 --> 16:13.725
Congrats.

16:14.991 --> 16:17.492
You wanna be my flower girl,
yeah?

16:17.525 --> 16:19.024
Yes.

16:42.658 --> 16:45.725
You seemed a little
surprised by Mark's proposal.

16:46.991 --> 16:49.158
You have to admit though,
it's classic Mark.

16:50.525 --> 16:52.426
Your brother's so
unconventional.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.658
What a sweetie Bev is though.

16:59.858 --> 17:02.558
I really think they're gonna
be great for one another.

17:04.892 --> 17:05.725
Yeah,

17:07.057 --> 17:08.658
Bev is pretty wonderful.

17:12.057 --> 17:13.057
I'm happy for them.

17:16.991 --> 17:18.459
So your younger brother

17:21.057 --> 17:22.989
is getting married before you.

17:22.991 --> 17:24.591
How's that make you feel?

17:28.258 --> 17:29.890
It was just yesterday he was
asking

17:29.892 --> 17:31.725
if he should take her out on a
date.

17:33.091 --> 17:34.558
And now, well, he's...

17:35.792 --> 17:37.491
Passing you by?

17:37.558 --> 17:38.892
Didn't ask your permission?

17:45.892 --> 17:46.725
Dad,

17:49.057 --> 17:53.258
how do you know if God's leading
you in a certain direction?

17:58.392 --> 18:01.792
Well, I mean is it something
specific or just in general?

18:04.792 --> 18:06.057
I don't know.

18:09.124 --> 18:10.892
I always thought there'd be
certain things

18:10.991 --> 18:15.991
that were important to me
and I guess they still are,

18:17.057 --> 18:20.324
but they just don't
seem realistic anymore.

18:22.991 --> 18:23.825
What?

18:25.024 --> 18:26.224
That was about as clear as mud.

18:26.291 --> 18:27.858
Are we talkin' about women here?

18:29.991 --> 18:30.792
A woman?

18:32.991 --> 18:33.825
Hope?

18:35.858 --> 18:37.224
How do you do that?

18:37.291 --> 18:39.823
It's like you're my dad or
something.

18:39.825 --> 18:42.491
Trust me, I've honed
these skills over the years.

18:42.525 --> 18:44.458
I mean, how old are you now?

18:48.325 --> 18:50.691
Okay, so you're attracted to
this girl,

18:52.158 --> 18:53.691
you're trying to figure out if
this

18:53.725 --> 18:55.792
is a road that's gonna lead to
love?

18:57.391 --> 18:58.491
Something like that.

19:00.057 --> 19:00.991
You got a map?

19:03.425 --> 19:08.224
I don't think God's will
is a map with a road on it.

19:10.991 --> 19:12.892
So I wouldn't want to waste

19:12.991 --> 19:15.258
my time trying to figure out
that route.

19:17.191 --> 19:18.224
You know what I mean?

19:18.258 --> 19:23.091
It's always been like,
it's more like a compass.

19:25.191 --> 19:27.358
Really you just point it toward
Him

19:28.525 --> 19:31.057
and then move in that direction.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.024
Too much philosophy?

19:37.991 --> 19:41.358
All right, let's go for
application.

19:41.391 --> 19:43.057
Are you sweet on this girl?

19:43.091 --> 19:47.792
'Cause if you are, just get
to know her, be her friend.

19:49.259 --> 19:50.091
I mean,

19:51.358 --> 19:55.358
you don't have to know God's
perfect plan

19:55.391 --> 19:57.758
and direction for your life in
the future

19:57.792 --> 19:58.792
in order to know

20:00.991 --> 20:02.858
how you should act right now.

20:06.525 --> 20:07.358
Okay.

20:08.924 --> 20:09.792
That makes sense.

20:13.291 --> 20:16.057
And son, stop competing
with your brother.

20:18.458 --> 20:21.291
Y'all's journeys are different
and there's

20:21.358 --> 20:24.091
no rule about the timing
and order in life.

20:25.758 --> 20:26.591
Just be you.

20:30.858 --> 20:31.691
Thanks, dad.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.858
You're welcome, son.

20:40.957 --> 20:43.558
I believe our dreams
come true

20:43.591 --> 20:46.792
and if I can help someone
make their dream a reality,

20:46.858 --> 20:49.425
that's far more important than
me selling a few more books.

20:49.458 --> 20:53.124
I'm very grateful for the
opportunity, Ms. Sinclaire.

20:53.158 --> 20:54.689
Please, call me
Desiree.

20:54.691 --> 20:57.558
I'm just concerned about the
resources

20:57.591 --> 21:01.358
that would be required
for a print run that size.

21:01.425 --> 21:02.858
What you're talking about

21:02.991 --> 21:05.989
is 10 times more than I've ever
done.

21:05.991 --> 21:08.256
No worries,
that's Harrison's job.

21:08.258 --> 21:10.192
The company you've built may be
small

21:10.258 --> 21:13.756
but it has a reputation for
quality,

21:13.758 --> 21:17.691
a reputation for inspiring
young girls to aspire for more

21:17.758 --> 21:21.258
and that reputation is why
I'm set on using your company.

21:22.258 --> 21:24.625
It's time for my interview,
I have to cut this short.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.792
Harrison, you can finish
this up without me.

21:26.825 --> 21:28.192
Of course.

21:28.258 --> 21:29.792
Hope, I am so
looking

21:29.825 --> 21:32.525
forward to pursuing this dream
together.

21:32.591 --> 21:34.258
Thank you Mrs. Sinc, Desiree.

21:37.159 --> 21:38.691
Mrs. Sinclaire's ready
to provide the funds

21:38.758 --> 21:41.423
necessary for the first
run in exchange for

21:41.425 --> 21:43.591
a percentage of interest in
the publishing company itself.

21:43.625 --> 21:45.591
What sort of percentage?

21:45.625 --> 21:47.024
It depends on the
amount of the first run

21:47.091 --> 21:50.858
but if you go by our estimates
of 3.5 million copies,

21:50.991 --> 21:53.591
we're looking at about 35%.

21:55.291 --> 21:57.691
We never discussed anything
like that.

21:57.758 --> 22:00.089
I'm gonna have to read over
these.

22:00.091 --> 22:03.892
That's why we're here, Miss
Sanchez, to look over these.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.224
Honestly, I do not know what
Desiree

22:08.258 --> 22:10.989
is thinking allowing you
to handle the publication.

22:10.991 --> 22:14.159
Desiree just loves
making dreams come true.

22:16.658 --> 22:21.191
Excuse me, Mr. Scott,
I'm a professional.

22:21.224 --> 22:24.725
I built this company from the
ground up

22:24.758 --> 22:28.358
and as Mrs. Sinclaire stated,
Quiet Place

22:28.391 --> 22:32.224
Publishing has a stellar
reputation.

22:32.258 --> 22:35.725
So I expect you to treat me
with the respect that I deserve.

22:38.191 --> 22:42.224
Miss Sanchez, you have
a sock stuck to your back.

23:16.124 --> 23:18.658
Thomas, you going
to get ice cream or what?

23:18.725 --> 23:20.892
Yes, I'm going.

23:27.825 --> 23:31.792
There are so many
flavors to choose from.

23:31.825 --> 23:33.758
We close at 9:00.

23:33.792 --> 23:34.989
It's only like 5:30.

23:34.991 --> 23:36.458
Just giving you a heads up.

23:51.991 --> 23:55.391
I'd go with the Death by
Mocha, it's one of my favorites.

23:55.425 --> 23:57.091
Yeah, it's a good one.

23:57.992 --> 24:00.124
All right, I have made my
decision.

24:00.158 --> 24:01.058
Hooray.

24:02.858 --> 24:06.025
I will take a cup of Death by
Mocha

24:06.057 --> 24:09.057
and a cup of Tall, Dark and
Chocolate.

24:11.491 --> 24:14.790
Hey, did my mother send you
here?

24:14.792 --> 24:18.289
I should ask you the same
question, did Bev send you here?

24:18.291 --> 24:20.458
You would think so,
right?

24:20.491 --> 24:22.358
Actually, I would like those
to go.

24:29.992 --> 24:31.790
- Wow, she's super sweet.
- Yeah, yep.

24:31.792 --> 24:32.625
I noticed that.

24:34.725 --> 24:36.691
Two cups of ice cream

24:36.725 --> 24:39.892
to go will be $7.23.

24:39.992 --> 24:42.291
I actually have a coupon,

24:43.691 --> 24:44.992
hold on.

24:46.224 --> 24:47.191
Okay.

24:48.124 --> 24:50.391
Here we go, buy one, get one
free.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.391
I'm sorry ma'am, but you must
inform me

24:52.458 --> 24:54.725
before I ring you up
that you have a coupon.

24:54.792 --> 24:55.623
What are you talking about?

24:55.625 --> 24:57.289
It says "Buy one, get one free."

24:57.291 --> 25:01.258
Yes, I know but it
also says "Customer must

25:01.291 --> 25:04.391
"inform employee that they
have a coupon upon ordering."

25:04.425 --> 25:06.892
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

25:06.992 --> 25:10.224
Hey, I got an idea, I'm just
gonna

25:11.191 --> 25:14.189
take that from you, oh
look, I got a coupon,

25:14.191 --> 25:16.091
I'd like to order these
two cups of ice cream

25:16.124 --> 25:19.691
and add one more cup of Death
by Mocha for here, please.

25:20.892 --> 25:21.758
Thank you, doll.

25:22.991 --> 25:23.991
Gosh, I love her.

25:29.091 --> 25:31.191
So what are you gonna do?

25:31.224 --> 25:33.525
Well I'm gonna eat this ice
cream,

25:34.358 --> 25:37.792
pray about it and most
likely sign the contract.

25:40.358 --> 25:43.191
I saw that painting you did
for your mom, it's beautiful.

25:44.425 --> 25:45.258
Thank you.

25:46.391 --> 25:48.991
If you had to pick one,
photography or painting?

25:50.725 --> 25:53.689
That's like asking
what child you like more.

25:53.691 --> 25:55.391
Well I like Grace.

25:55.425 --> 25:57.191
Well there you go.

26:01.158 --> 26:03.191
I don't know, I guess painting
maybe.

26:04.191 --> 26:07.525
In a painting, I can pour
my passion, my ideals,

26:08.991 --> 26:11.324
my personal view of things into
it.

26:11.358 --> 26:13.525
You know, it's my creation.

26:14.491 --> 26:17.091
I decide everything, there's
nothing left to chance.

26:19.591 --> 26:20.425
- But...
- But?

26:21.258 --> 26:24.091
A photograph is all about a
moment.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.456
You know, there's always
moments just passing by.

26:26.458 --> 26:29.091
It's so easy to miss the
details.

26:29.124 --> 26:32.589
So a photograph can reveal the
things that you might miss.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.989
Like, I don't know, like
a butterfly taking wing

26:35.991 --> 26:39.158
or the joy of a little
girl hugging her new puppy.

26:39.191 --> 26:41.991
You know, the things you
might not see otherwise.

26:43.291 --> 26:47.291
So I don't know, I guess I love
them both.

26:48.525 --> 26:50.324
I never thought about it that
way.

26:51.591 --> 26:54.091
I guess I can see why it's
so hard for you to choose.

26:54.124 --> 26:54.991
Thank you.

26:55.991 --> 26:59.091
Thank you for sharing
your ice cream with me.

26:59.124 --> 27:00.991
We should do this again
sometime.

27:01.892 --> 27:04.658
Oh, and don't thank me, thank
Lawrence.

27:10.525 --> 27:13.158
Dude, what took you so long?

27:13.191 --> 27:15.859
Did the blue beast finally break
down?

27:15.892 --> 27:17.024
Where is my ice cream?

27:18.391 --> 27:19.892
Oh.

27:19.991 --> 27:22.858
I just had the best ice cream.

27:25.057 --> 27:28.358
Oh no, you stopped for ice
cream in the middle of the day?

27:30.558 --> 27:31.391
Gosh, girlfriend.

27:33.826 --> 27:34.991
Was it that bad?

27:36.224 --> 27:38.324
It's just a lot to think
about.

27:41.525 --> 27:43.591
You'll never guess who I ran
into today.

27:44.525 --> 27:47.024
Was this the work of
one Martha McKenzie?

27:47.057 --> 27:48.826
See, I thought that but you
were

27:48.858 --> 27:50.224
the one that sent me for the ice
cream.

27:50.258 --> 27:51.989
Which I still don't have,

27:51.991 --> 27:54.358
by the way but it doesn't
matter.

27:54.391 --> 27:56.024
It sounds like destiny, my
friend.

27:56.057 --> 27:58.391
It was just a coincidence.

27:58.425 --> 28:02.055
In God's economy, there
are no coincidences.

28:02.057 --> 28:03.425
At least that's what Pastor Mike
says.

28:03.458 --> 28:06.389
It was just ice cream.

28:06.391 --> 28:08.091
I still wanna hear all the
details.

28:08.124 --> 28:10.991
We just talked, it was fun.

28:12.558 --> 28:14.057
You were right.

28:14.091 --> 28:14.991
Wait, what?

28:15.991 --> 28:17.091
Ha ha ho, I need to record this.

28:17.124 --> 28:19.124
Start at "You were right,
Lawrence."

28:19.158 --> 28:20.724
Stop.

28:20.726 --> 28:22.892
Okay, so you asked her out
then?

28:22.991 --> 28:24.724
Sort of.

28:24.726 --> 28:26.057
What do you mean sort of?

28:26.091 --> 28:28.625
Well you know, "This was nice,

28:28.658 --> 28:31.055
"we should do it again
sometime."

28:31.057 --> 28:34.055
You're kidding me, you
pulled the friend date?

28:34.057 --> 28:35.091
Have you learned nothing from
me?

28:35.124 --> 28:38.291
You need to ask this woman
out, be clear, be a man.

28:38.324 --> 28:40.625
- I will ask her out.
- When?

28:40.658 --> 28:42.158
I don't know, soon.

28:42.224 --> 28:44.556
Thomas, you have got to get
your head

28:44.558 --> 28:47.091
out of your sketchbook and into
reality.

28:47.124 --> 28:48.458
This has nothing to do with
that.

28:48.491 --> 28:50.258
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

28:50.291 --> 28:52.389
- Okay, call her now then.
- Now?

28:52.391 --> 28:53.389
Right now.

28:53.391 --> 28:56.591
I am not gonna call him, Bev.

28:56.625 --> 28:57.991
He played the friend card,

28:58.057 --> 29:01.158
so you just call him as a
friend.

29:01.191 --> 29:02.892
Have him come over and fix
something.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.892
I don't have anything broken.

29:04.991 --> 29:06.892
I can break something.

29:06.991 --> 29:09.158
The oven, the microwave,
,

29:09.191 --> 29:11.692
I got it, hole in the wall,
super easy.

29:11.726 --> 29:13.156
You are starting to sound like

29:13.158 --> 29:16.289
my soon-to-be sister-in-law
or worse, my mother.

29:16.291 --> 29:17.458
That's your own fault.

29:17.491 --> 29:18.792
If would've brought me my ice
cream,

29:18.825 --> 29:21.790
I'd be feeling happy and
satisfied but you didn't,

29:21.792 --> 29:24.625
so I'm feeling sad and
hangry and the only thing

29:24.658 --> 29:25.991
that's gonna make me feel better
right now

29:26.024 --> 29:28.391
is making you do something
you don't really wanna do.

29:29.291 --> 29:31.158
That makes absolutely no
sense.

29:31.191 --> 29:33.858
Well it does to me, now are
you gonna call her or what?

29:39.391 --> 29:42.458
It's been three years
since Darryl passed away

29:43.491 --> 29:45.692
and you used to light
up when he was around.

29:47.057 --> 29:48.792
I haven't seen you like that
since.

29:50.057 --> 29:52.122
Except

29:52.124 --> 29:56.122
I caught a little
glimmer of it last night.

29:56.124 --> 29:59.623
Grace and I are still
adjusting.

29:59.625 --> 30:01.858
I have this deal with Desiree
Sinclaire,

30:01.892 --> 30:05.224
I don't need to add romance to
my plate.

30:05.291 --> 30:06.324
Come on, Hope.

30:07.659 --> 30:09.525
Just call him.

30:14.525 --> 30:15.525
Ha ha, ha.

30:17.691 --> 30:18.491
Destiny.

32:20.591 --> 32:21.691
You ready for today?

32:21.758 --> 32:24.256
It's a beautiful day for a
shoot, huh?

32:24.258 --> 32:25.758
Okay, Mr. Rogers.

32:28.124 --> 32:29.258
That boy's got it bad.

32:40.792 --> 32:41.691
Yeah.

32:41.758 --> 32:42.526
I think today is gonna go
really well.

32:42.591 --> 32:44.258
- I agree.
- I'm excited to work

32:44.291 --> 32:46.124
with you on this whole thing.

32:46.158 --> 32:47.858
- Excuse me for a second.
- Okay.

32:50.492 --> 32:52.589
I am so glad you're here.

32:52.591 --> 32:54.589
I don't know why I feel
so nervous about today.

32:54.591 --> 32:57.124
I keep thinking there's a
sock on my back or something.

32:57.158 --> 32:58.625
Will you tell me?

32:59.991 --> 33:01.358
Well, now that you mention
it...

33:01.391 --> 33:02.725
- Seriously?
- Hey,

33:02.758 --> 33:04.758
you're gonna be great, don't be
nervous.

33:08.324 --> 33:09.425
Okay.

33:09.492 --> 33:12.758
So, I was gonna ask you
if you wanted to celebrate

33:12.825 --> 33:15.658
a new client with me over
dinner tomorrow night.

33:15.691 --> 33:18.525
A new client, who is this new
client?

33:18.558 --> 33:19.391
It's you.

33:20.426 --> 33:21.258
Me.

33:22.258 --> 33:24.591
Wow, a dinner date.

33:24.658 --> 33:27.191
Will there be Happy Meals on the
menu?

33:27.224 --> 33:29.558
It sounds tempting but I was
thinking

33:29.591 --> 33:33.322
more of a tender steak and rumor
has it

33:33.324 --> 33:36.322
they have linen napkins at this
place.

33:36.324 --> 33:38.258
- Wow.
- Fancy joint.

33:38.324 --> 33:40.656
Well, I love me some steak.

33:40.658 --> 33:41.591
It's a date then.

33:43.525 --> 33:45.024
Excuse me, Hope.

33:45.057 --> 33:46.825
Miss Sinclaire has just arrived.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.525
Okay, wish me luck, see you
later.

33:49.558 --> 33:50.491
- Okay.
- No way!

33:51.591 --> 33:52.691
No way, dude!

33:54.358 --> 33:55.191
Lawrence.

33:56.491 --> 33:59.191
- Lawrence.
- This is unbelievable!

33:59.224 --> 34:01.224
Dude, keep your voice down,
what are you screaming about?

34:01.258 --> 34:02.091
Dude.

34:03.991 --> 34:07.224
You are not gonna believe
who wrote this book.

34:07.258 --> 34:09.658
It looks
like Desiree Sinclaire.

34:09.725 --> 34:11.222
Nope.

34:11.224 --> 34:12.057
Betty.

34:23.758 --> 34:24.658
It's her.

34:27.091 --> 34:31.458
Hey, hey, we got work to
do, so let's go do that.

34:32.426 --> 34:37.392
Oh my gosh.

34:41.558 --> 34:43.392
Okay, I think
I have what I need.

34:43.425 --> 34:44.892
Thank you, girls.

34:44.991 --> 34:46.591
- You all are so beautiful.
- Thank you so much.

34:46.625 --> 34:47.491
Sure thing.

34:52.392 --> 34:53.625
Amazing.

34:53.658 --> 34:56.390
The picture or the subject?

34:56.392 --> 34:57.991
Miss Sinclaire, I am...

34:58.991 --> 35:02.790
Thomas McKenzie, Hope
told me all about you.

35:02.792 --> 35:04.224
May I?

35:04.291 --> 35:05.991
Yes, yes, of course.

35:09.792 --> 35:13.525
You've impressed me, Thomas
and I'm not easily impressed.

35:13.558 --> 35:15.725
You should see his paintings.

35:15.792 --> 35:17.625
Ooh, a man of many talents.

35:19.158 --> 35:20.825
I am thinking about selling my
house

35:20.858 --> 35:23.458
and I need to get some pictures
taken.

35:23.491 --> 35:25.792
But I don't like letting
strangers into my house.

35:25.825 --> 35:28.892
Well I know you're thinking
we only just met but

35:28.991 --> 35:32.124
I already feel like I can trust
you, I feel like I know you.

35:32.158 --> 35:33.491
How do you feel, Thomas?

35:34.458 --> 35:37.623
I feel like I would be happy

35:37.625 --> 35:39.325
to take those pictures for you.

35:39.359 --> 35:42.292
Grand, tomorrow afternoon, say
2:00?

35:42.325 --> 35:43.525
Yeah, sure.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.558
Text me, I'll get you all the
details.

35:49.625 --> 35:50.792
What prayers do I need

35:50.825 --> 35:53.124
to say to get me something like
that?

35:54.858 --> 35:56.325
I'm thinking about converting.

35:58.124 --> 35:59.358
What just happened?

35:59.391 --> 36:02.991
You, Thomas McKenzie, are
becoming quite the player.

36:15.259 --> 36:17.458
Hey, thank you again.

36:17.525 --> 36:20.292
Desiree seemed super
impressed with everything.

36:20.358 --> 36:21.725
Ah, good, yeah.

36:21.758 --> 36:23.725
So what time do you
want to head out tomorrow?

36:23.758 --> 36:26.057
Oh, actually, funny thing,

36:26.091 --> 36:28.292
I ended up getting a new gig for
tomorrow.

36:28.358 --> 36:29.425
- Oh.
- Yeah.

36:29.491 --> 36:32.191
So I'm gonna have to take
a rain check on that date.

36:32.224 --> 36:34.558
No problem, that's
good right, a new client?

36:34.591 --> 36:36.991
- Mm hmm, a new client.
- What is it?

36:37.024 --> 36:39.124
Just some photo gig thing.

36:39.191 --> 36:41.691
Like a family portrait thing?

36:41.725 --> 36:43.525
Something new actually.

36:43.558 --> 36:45.458
There is this house that's
going on the market,

36:45.525 --> 36:47.689
so I'm taking the photos of the
interior.

36:47.691 --> 36:49.022
That's cool, so you're gonna
make

36:49.024 --> 36:51.689
the rooms look twice as
big as they really are.

36:51.691 --> 36:53.091
Something like that.

36:53.124 --> 36:56.391
Well, now we have two
reasons to celebrate.

36:56.425 --> 36:57.259
One, two.

36:58.391 --> 37:00.091
And nothing screams
celebration

37:00.124 --> 37:03.358
like a delicious medium-rare
steak.

37:04.691 --> 37:08.491
Excuse me Hope, I have
some papers you need to sign.

37:08.525 --> 37:10.792
Okay, I am gonna hold
you to that rain check.

37:10.825 --> 37:12.091
- You do that.
- Duty calls.

37:12.124 --> 37:14.991
Duty calls, you go and do your
duty.

37:17.192 --> 37:18.192
That felt awful.

37:19.425 --> 37:22.091
Nah, you handled it.

37:22.124 --> 37:22.991
Ugh, gosh.

37:24.024 --> 37:25.458
I'm just gonna call Desiree

37:25.491 --> 37:27.825
and tell her that I can't do the
shoot.

37:27.858 --> 37:28.989
What?

37:28.991 --> 37:32.124
No, you can't do that, man,
she's your perfect girl.

37:32.158 --> 37:33.989
Just yesterday you
were the one telling me

37:33.991 --> 37:37.591
to ditch the list, saying
it was holding me back.

37:38.591 --> 37:42.124
That's when it wasn't
real, this is real.

37:42.158 --> 37:46.192
Besides, what's wrong with a
good guy getting what he wants?

37:46.258 --> 37:48.691
I mean I guess it was pretty
miraculous.

37:49.991 --> 37:51.091
But what about Hope?

37:52.324 --> 37:53.192
What about her?

37:54.258 --> 37:55.024
You know what, Lawrence?

37:55.091 --> 37:56.991
Sometimes you can be a real
jerk.

37:58.324 --> 37:59.858
Thomas, do you think you're
the first

37:59.991 --> 38:01.989
guy who's ever liked two girls
at once?

38:01.991 --> 38:06.425
Take me for instance, I like
like five, six girls right now.

38:06.491 --> 38:07.892
You're single, it's not like

38:07.991 --> 38:09.991
you're betraying some sort of
commitment.

38:10.024 --> 38:12.324
Look, okay, this is insane.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.991
You painted a woman, this is
that woman.

38:15.991 --> 38:16.823
You're gonna regret it your

38:16.825 --> 38:18.558
whole life if you don't go after
her.

38:22.658 --> 38:25.391
Okay look, if anything, we need
the money.

38:25.425 --> 38:28.991
So go to Betty's, take her
pictures,

38:29.024 --> 38:31.159
you know, strictly business, no
harm done.

38:33.658 --> 38:34.758
Strictly business.

38:36.658 --> 38:37.525
We need the money.

38:40.291 --> 38:41.491
All right, I'll go.

38:43.525 --> 38:44.358
Yes.

39:08.458 --> 39:09.792
- Thomas.
- Hello.

39:09.825 --> 39:11.391
Welcome.

39:11.425 --> 39:14.125
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

39:14.158 --> 39:17.224
Wow, where would you like to get
started?

39:17.258 --> 39:19.892
Oh come on, Thomas,
we have all day, relax.

39:32.792 --> 39:34.291
Your paintings are stunning.

39:36.825 --> 39:38.158
They remind me of the art
museums

39:38.224 --> 39:40.625
my mom used to take me to as a
kid.

39:40.658 --> 39:44.092
I think I was around 10 when
I saw the most beautiful

39:44.124 --> 39:47.892
painting of Gainsborough's
Queen Charlotte and that was it.

39:48.825 --> 39:51.425
I decided one day I'd have
to have my portrait done.

39:52.425 --> 39:54.989
I went home and added it to my
list.

39:56.991 --> 39:58.556
You have a list?

39:58.558 --> 39:59.989
Yeah.

39:59.991 --> 40:01.792
Do you think that's silly?

40:01.825 --> 40:02.658
No.

40:03.625 --> 40:05.222
No.

40:05.224 --> 40:07.658
I mean what else is on your
list?

40:07.725 --> 40:10.058
Oh you know, places to see,

40:10.091 --> 40:12.658
people to meet, goals to
accomplish.

40:13.725 --> 40:16.222
It's more than a bucket list,
you know?

40:16.224 --> 40:18.091
It's things I've dreamed about
doing.

40:20.158 --> 40:22.324
I thought I was the
only one with a list.

40:24.291 --> 40:25.124
Thomas,

40:26.892 --> 40:28.892
would you consider painting my
portrait?

40:30.725 --> 40:32.556
You want me to paint you?

40:32.558 --> 40:34.458
I'd love you to capture my
spirit.

40:36.058 --> 40:37.324
Your spirit?

40:37.391 --> 40:39.158
Yeah, I mean not just my looks

40:39.224 --> 40:42.892
or fame but the real Desiree
Sinclaire.

40:44.658 --> 40:45.658
Well...

40:45.725 --> 40:48.892
Thomas, you'd be making
my dreams come true.

40:48.924 --> 40:50.892
Wouldn't you love that, please?

40:52.224 --> 40:54.124
You'd be paid handsomely, of
course.

40:55.258 --> 40:57.124
May I think about it?

40:57.158 --> 40:57.992
Sure.

41:05.191 --> 41:07.625
So, now it's your turn to share.

41:08.491 --> 41:10.990
What's on your list?

41:10.992 --> 41:14.291
Oh , you
know, the usual things

41:14.324 --> 41:18.990
like getting married
and starting a family.

41:18.992 --> 41:21.858
Come on, Thomas,
everyone thinks about that.

41:21.892 --> 41:23.892
We're sharing secrets here.

41:23.992 --> 41:25.790
What is it you really want, you
know?

41:25.792 --> 41:28.124
What do you really dream about
doing?

41:29.224 --> 41:30.057
Well,

41:31.792 --> 41:32.625
I guess

41:34.324 --> 41:35.491
this.

41:35.525 --> 41:36.892
This, photography?

41:36.992 --> 41:39.324
Well, photography, painting,

41:40.224 --> 41:42.825
the chance to express myself
artistically.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.892
Aren't you already doing this?

41:45.992 --> 41:48.623
Yes but the trick is to do it

41:48.625 --> 41:50.558
and still manage to pay the
bills.

41:51.625 --> 41:52.558
Well what about fashion?

41:52.625 --> 41:54.291
Their rates are fantastic.

41:54.324 --> 41:57.892
Yeah, you know, I wanna
do fashion, I'd like to.

42:01.391 --> 42:03.291
I want to capture a woman's
beauty

42:03.358 --> 42:05.291
but not reduce her to an object.

42:08.625 --> 42:11.291
Oh, you want to maintain
integrity

42:11.358 --> 42:13.591
but avoid that starving artist
route, huh?

42:15.291 --> 42:19.792
I like eating and a roof over
my head is super appealing.

42:20.893 --> 42:23.091
Thomas, I think you're
dreaming too small.

42:24.358 --> 42:27.258
You're very talented
and you're so charming

42:27.291 --> 42:29.725
and you have an undeniable
passion.

42:31.191 --> 42:32.725
You just need someone to open
the door

42:32.758 --> 42:34.425
so you can meet the right
people.

42:37.191 --> 42:39.391
Thank you, I appreciate that.

42:40.758 --> 42:43.425
That's just it though, I don't
really know

42:43.458 --> 42:46.558
the people who know the
right people, so.

42:46.591 --> 42:49.258
Thomas, you do now.

42:55.391 --> 42:57.991
Have you read any of these
books?

42:58.024 --> 43:02.792
They are light on the mystery
and pretty heavy on the S-E-X.

43:02.825 --> 43:05.423
Well now she wants to write
books

43:05.425 --> 43:07.425
that are inspirational to young
girls.

43:08.291 --> 43:09.091
I think it's gonna be pretty
hard

43:09.124 --> 43:11.691
for that zebra to change her
spots.

43:11.758 --> 43:14.658
Stripes, a zebra has stripes,
not spots.

43:16.591 --> 43:20.358
Whoa, does she really look
like this?

43:25.191 --> 43:26.756
Whoa.

43:26.758 --> 43:30.158
That woman is so beautiful...

43:31.458 --> 43:36.091
ly photographed, I mean
look at the lighting.

43:36.124 --> 43:37.258
It's very nice.

43:40.591 --> 43:43.625
Hey guys, sorry I'm late.

43:43.658 --> 43:45.658
- Thomas.
- Hey, Gracie.

43:45.691 --> 43:47.258
But wait 'til you guys hear.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.089
- How'd it go?
- Oh, it went great.

43:49.091 --> 43:51.991
The place is enormous, I can
see why she wants to downsize.

43:52.024 --> 43:53.826
Who, who wants to downsize?

43:53.859 --> 43:54.859
Desiree Sinclaire.

43:56.324 --> 43:57.625
You were with Desiree?

43:58.625 --> 44:01.991
You were at her house?

44:03.658 --> 44:05.358
Oh Thomas, here you are.

44:05.391 --> 44:06.191
Mother.

44:07.324 --> 44:10.324
Sweet, I'm happy
to see you too, honey.

44:10.358 --> 44:13.491
That lasagna smells
amazing, I am starving.

44:13.525 --> 44:15.824
- Wait a minute, bro.
- Can I see the pictures?

44:15.826 --> 44:17.656
I just want to see how
the other half lives.

44:17.658 --> 44:19.091
The other half of what?

44:19.158 --> 44:21.591
Okay, slow down everybody.

44:21.658 --> 44:23.156
Yesterday at the photo shoot,

44:23.158 --> 44:25.991
Desiree asked me to come
take photos of her house.

44:26.024 --> 44:27.391
Oh, that's cool.

44:27.425 --> 44:31.158
And she commissioned
me to paint her portrait.

44:32.158 --> 44:35.591
Thomas, that's
wonderful, congratulations.

44:35.658 --> 44:37.091
Thank you, mother.

44:37.158 --> 44:38.991
I haven't actually
accepted it yet, you know?

44:39.024 --> 44:41.391
It would take a ton of time,
so...

44:41.425 --> 44:42.892
What would take a ton of time?

44:42.991 --> 44:45.491
Painting that Danielle
Sinclaire...

44:45.525 --> 44:46.858
- Desiree.
- Desiree.

44:46.892 --> 44:48.024
Well anyway,

44:48.057 --> 44:50.658
she wants to commission
Thomas to paint her portrait.

44:51.858 --> 44:52.691
No way.

44:53.991 --> 44:58.991
No flipping way, Desiree wants
T-man to paint her picture?

45:00.091 --> 45:02.258
I wouldn't think that
would take too long at all.

45:02.291 --> 45:05.224
And she said that she
wants to introduce me

45:05.258 --> 45:08.055
to some high powered
advertising executive.

45:08.057 --> 45:11.491
She thinks I have potential to
be a commercial photographer.

45:11.558 --> 45:13.124
- Oh my god.
- Potential, hmm.

45:13.158 --> 45:17.055
Well you, Thomas McKenzie
have had a very productive day

45:17.057 --> 45:20.391
and I personally cannot
wait to see where it leads.

45:22.391 --> 45:24.389
Is anybody coming to the
table?

45:24.391 --> 45:26.258
Dinner's getting cold.

45:26.291 --> 45:29.558
Come on you guys,
let's eat.

45:30.892 --> 45:32.892
So Desiree thinks you have
potential?

45:34.391 --> 45:35.224
Hey.

45:40.158 --> 45:43.892
I'm sorry I didn't mention
the shoot was at Desiree's.

45:43.991 --> 45:48.825
I just didn't want to make it
a big deal because it wasn't.

45:48.892 --> 45:49.726
It's okay.

45:51.391 --> 45:53.057
I do still owe you that
dinner.

45:55.558 --> 45:56.726
How about tomorrow?

45:59.892 --> 46:02.858
I can't tomorrow, that's when
Desiree

46:02.892 --> 46:07.892
is introducing me to that ad
exec guy but hey, next week.

46:10.458 --> 46:11.391
Next week.

46:40.491 --> 46:43.991
Wow, the suit really does make
the man.

46:44.991 --> 46:46.191
How do you feel, Thomas?

46:47.525 --> 46:50.725
Actually I feel pretty good.

46:50.792 --> 46:55.792
Confidence looks good on you,
almost as good as that suit.

47:04.124 --> 47:05.691
So I look this guy
right in the eye, right?

47:05.725 --> 47:09.558
And I look at him and I say
"Hey, do you know who I am?"

47:09.591 --> 47:10.725
It turns out he does.

47:11.626 --> 47:13.858
They usually do and I
usually get what I want,

47:13.892 --> 47:16.725
that's how I got this,
hang on, I gotta get this.

47:16.758 --> 47:18.258
You guys enjoy yourselves.

47:19.258 --> 47:22.258
Stay close, these people are
sharks.

47:22.291 --> 47:23.124
Okay.

47:24.758 --> 47:26.191
Oh.

47:31.358 --> 47:32.191
Hi.

47:33.191 --> 47:34.057
That's, all right.

47:34.091 --> 47:37.358
Oh, I'm so sorry, excuse me,
sorry.

47:40.224 --> 47:41.525
Oh, thank you.

47:41.558 --> 47:43.358
Pardon me, pardon me, guys.

47:50.991 --> 47:51.758
Good evening.

47:52.725 --> 47:53.559
Hi.

47:58.358 --> 47:59.191
Okay.

48:03.124 --> 48:04.691
I don't have time to be
bothered

48:04.758 --> 48:06.258
with all these little details.

48:07.525 --> 48:10.691
Look Eileen, you are Mrs. Mason
Campbell,

48:10.758 --> 48:13.158
just tell 'em that and
your problem will go away.

48:14.758 --> 48:16.825
I got people here, I gotta go.

48:16.858 --> 48:17.691
Mason.

48:19.425 --> 48:22.658
May I introduce to you Thomas
McKenzie.

48:22.691 --> 48:23.491
Tommy boy.

48:23.526 --> 48:25.758
Thomas, this is Mason
Campbell.

48:25.792 --> 48:28.989
Desiree says you're
quite the photographer.

48:28.991 --> 48:30.324
Thanks.

48:30.358 --> 48:31.191
Is he the real deal

48:31.258 --> 48:32.258
or is he just your flavor of the
month?

48:32.324 --> 48:34.858
Oh Mason darling, have
I ever steered you wrong?

48:34.991 --> 48:38.191
Oh, don't get me started.

48:38.258 --> 48:40.091
That's good, that's real good.

48:40.124 --> 48:42.425
I like a man who projects
confidence.

48:46.991 --> 48:48.758
You got a good eye, Tommy boy.

48:51.792 --> 48:54.191
What do you think, you think
he can handle the shoot?

48:54.258 --> 48:56.792
I think he can handle
anything.

48:56.825 --> 48:59.291
Okay, I'll consider you.

49:00.258 --> 49:03.158
Reardon Ford is my go-to
guy but if for some reason

49:04.057 --> 49:06.391
he becomes unavailable,
I'll give you a shot.

49:06.425 --> 49:08.591
Thank you for your
consideration, Mr. Campbell.

49:08.658 --> 49:10.991
Garcon, a couple black bowls.

49:11.024 --> 49:11.825
Ladies?

49:11.858 --> 49:13.091
- Of course.
- My favorite.

49:13.158 --> 49:14.490
- Quattro.
- Is that it?

49:14.492 --> 49:15.324
It's a done deal?

49:15.358 --> 49:17.892
Get used to life in the fast
lane.

49:22.391 --> 49:26.158
Yes, well here's to
you, Desiree and your boy.

49:32.892 --> 49:34.492
Excuse me.

49:34.525 --> 49:36.525
Welcome to the big leagues,
Tommy boy.

49:40.158 --> 49:41.156
Thomas,

49:41.158 --> 49:42.991
I don't think that could
have gone any better.

49:43.024 --> 49:45.758
I don't know what I was
expecting but not that.

49:46.825 --> 49:51.324
I mean the limo, all
those people, that girl.

49:53.658 --> 49:55.490
How well do you know Mason?

49:55.492 --> 49:57.324
Well enough, he's the kind of
person

49:57.358 --> 49:59.258
you want to know in business but
not

49:59.324 --> 50:01.591
to come to your granny's
for Christmas dinner.

50:03.091 --> 50:05.258
- Do you trust him?
- No, not at all.

50:06.158 --> 50:09.491
But that's life, Thomas, not
everyone is as noble as you.

50:11.191 --> 50:14.224
I don't know if he's
someone I'd want to work with.

50:14.258 --> 50:16.091
That is one step in a journey

50:16.158 --> 50:17.892
to get you to where you want to
be.

50:19.024 --> 50:22.224
Now, let's toast to new
relationships.

50:22.258 --> 50:24.489
Oh, I'm a bit of a
lightweight,

50:24.491 --> 50:26.158
I'm still feeling that whiskey.

50:26.991 --> 50:28.489
See, you're so genuine.

50:28.491 --> 50:30.758
I know so many men that
would never admit to that.

50:30.825 --> 50:34.358
But lucky for you, we
have sparkling water.

50:34.392 --> 50:35.591
Oh.

50:35.658 --> 50:36.825
Let's toast with that.

50:38.191 --> 50:41.091
To the man who deserves
everything coming his way.

50:51.258 --> 50:53.989
Thanks again for everything,
it was...

51:00.358 --> 51:02.091
Goodnight, Thomas.

51:03.892 --> 51:04.892
Goodnight.

51:46.892 --> 51:47.725
Wow.

51:52.758 --> 51:54.792
They're all so delicious.

51:54.825 --> 51:59.825
Momma Martha was right, this
Karen girl is a baking genius.

52:00.625 --> 52:02.024
I don't know how in the world

52:02.057 --> 52:04.658
you're gonna be able to pick one
of these.

52:04.691 --> 52:07.790
One, how could we pick just
one?

52:07.792 --> 52:09.558
Hey guys.

52:09.625 --> 52:11.658
Hey Thomas, perfect timing.

52:11.691 --> 52:12.989
Hey, is dad here?

52:12.991 --> 52:14.325
I need to talk to him about
something.

52:14.359 --> 52:15.989
No, he's out golfing but get
in here,

52:15.991 --> 52:18.458
you gotta get in on some of this
action.

52:19.792 --> 52:22.122
Wow, it looks like you guys
are really

52:22.124 --> 52:24.391
enjoying this whole
wedding planning thing.

52:25.858 --> 52:27.458
Hey, do you got a second?

52:27.491 --> 52:30.158
Sure.

52:33.892 --> 52:34.858
What's up, man?

52:36.458 --> 52:39.825
I know this is kinda
outta left field but

52:39.858 --> 52:41.658
how do you know that Bev's the
one?

52:42.991 --> 52:43.792
I love her.

52:45.124 --> 52:46.325
Right, but how do you know
that

52:46.358 --> 52:48.325
she's the one you're supposed to
marry?

52:49.525 --> 52:50.991
I don't know, I chose her.

52:52.024 --> 52:53.324
I mean how could I not choose
her?

52:53.358 --> 52:54.191
Look at her,

52:55.292 --> 52:57.792
she's beautiful and smart

52:57.825 --> 53:01.989
and funny and she fits in
so well with our family.

53:01.991 --> 53:05.259
And she totally gets
me and loves me anyway.

53:06.358 --> 53:09.091
Everything else is just icing on
the cake.

53:14.259 --> 53:15.292
- Oh babe.
- You love that one.

53:15.358 --> 53:16.691
This is the one.

53:17.591 --> 53:19.525
You gotta try this, this is the
one.

53:21.091 --> 53:23.792
You know, we should praise

53:23.858 --> 53:26.391
that other wedding tradition as
well.

53:26.425 --> 53:28.391
What do you mean?

53:29.758 --> 53:30.991
Mark McKenzie.

53:33.124 --> 53:35.191
You did not just do that.

53:36.391 --> 53:37.391
No.

53:38.291 --> 53:39.291
Oh my god.

53:44.858 --> 53:46.625
Thanks bro, thanks.

53:47.991 --> 53:49.792
- No.
- Oh my god.

53:49.858 --> 53:50.892
Oh my god.

53:50.991 --> 53:52.525
Turn her this way, turn
her this way, ha ha.

53:52.558 --> 53:53.792
No, no.

53:53.858 --> 53:56.024
Get her, get her.

53:58.625 --> 54:01.425
What are you four doing?

54:07.091 --> 54:10.256
Oh yeah, this one's
definitely my favorite.

54:10.258 --> 54:11.091
Yeah?

54:12.658 --> 54:13.991
Mm, that's good.

54:19.991 --> 54:22.291
Well that escalated quickly.

54:22.324 --> 54:24.591
I've had enough cake to last
me a month.

54:25.991 --> 54:28.756
I'm glad you were there to
participate in the festivities.

54:28.758 --> 54:30.991
Well a Maid of Honor's
work is never done.

54:31.991 --> 54:35.159
You know, like making sure
the Best Man is presentable.

54:35.192 --> 54:35.991
Hey.

54:37.124 --> 54:38.591
I was saving that for later.

54:40.758 --> 54:43.458
So how are things going
with Desiree's book?

54:44.858 --> 54:49.989
Challenging, I had no idea
what I was getting myself into.

54:49.991 --> 54:51.658
She is an enigma.

54:52.625 --> 54:56.792
This book she wants me to
publish is great in principle

54:56.825 --> 55:00.091
but we don't seem to be on the
same page with the content.

55:02.258 --> 55:05.525
On the same page, a
little publisher humor?

55:06.858 --> 55:07.825
You know.

55:10.758 --> 55:13.324
So what do you think about her?

55:16.358 --> 55:18.991
She's different than I
imagined.

55:20.591 --> 55:22.024
Everyone seems to like her.

55:22.991 --> 55:24.258
I mean what's not to like?

55:24.324 --> 55:27.823
She's beautiful, charming,

55:27.825 --> 55:28.991
successful...

55:29.024 --> 55:33.191
Hey, why don't we stop
talking about Desiree?

55:34.525 --> 55:35.358
You hungry?

55:45.991 --> 55:47.991
- Linen napkins.
- I told you.

55:49.358 --> 55:50.525
A beautiful view.

55:52.258 --> 55:54.191
It's a nice place, Thomas.

55:54.224 --> 55:58.425
Oh my goodness, have you seen
what they have on this menu?

55:58.491 --> 56:00.591
They've got a salad called the
Wedgie.

56:03.324 --> 56:04.158
What?

56:06.491 --> 56:10.258
Hope, Hope, I have something to
tell you.

56:10.291 --> 56:11.723
Can you please contain yourself?

56:11.725 --> 56:14.391
Oh my goodness, you are
embarrassing me.

56:22.558 --> 56:25.758
- There, as you were saying?
- Thank you.

56:27.291 --> 56:29.258
I hold here in my hand

56:30.158 --> 56:32.625
all the wonder and splendor and
excitement

56:32.658 --> 56:35.825
and delight and all those
other words about greatness

56:35.892 --> 56:37.591
that anyone could ever hope for.

56:39.458 --> 56:40.556
Ah,

56:40.558 --> 56:42.058
but not until

56:43.324 --> 56:44.558
you wear this.

56:50.425 --> 56:52.491
Oh, there she is.

56:53.625 --> 56:54.458
My lady.

56:57.991 --> 57:00.091
- Cirque Extreme?
- Mm hmm.

57:01.358 --> 57:03.124
- Saturday?
- Yep.

57:03.158 --> 57:04.224
Oh, Thomas.

57:05.158 --> 57:07.491
Oh, Grace is gonna be so
excited.

57:07.525 --> 57:09.558
Primo seats, by the way.

57:11.058 --> 57:13.025
You look ridiculous.

57:13.058 --> 57:15.990
And you look gorgeous,
especially when you smile.

57:15.992 --> 57:18.625
Well look who's
here, Thomas.

57:18.658 --> 57:20.291
- Oh, Desiree.
- And Hope.

57:20.324 --> 57:21.458
What a surprise.

57:23.725 --> 57:25.990
Of course, I should
have seen this earlier.

57:25.992 --> 57:26.792
You did what?

57:28.025 --> 57:30.224
What kind of an imbecile are
you, huh?

57:31.558 --> 57:33.391
Ah, don't worry, Mason works
it out.

57:33.458 --> 57:36.291
He usually gets what he wants.

57:36.324 --> 57:37.224
Should we order?

57:37.291 --> 57:38.990
Hey Tommy boy, come here.

57:38.992 --> 57:40.458
I'm surrounded by a bunch of
morons.

57:40.491 --> 57:41.525
You know what, why don't you
go ahead

57:41.558 --> 57:43.892
and order for the both of
us, I'll be right back.

57:45.725 --> 57:48.792
So, what's with the
noses?

57:48.825 --> 57:51.158
This is your lucky day.

57:51.191 --> 57:53.990
They just double-booked my
shoot, so they're gonna be

57:53.992 --> 57:56.792
pushing up to the 18th which
means Reardon is unavailable.

57:56.825 --> 57:59.122
I'm gonna give you a shot, all
right?

57:59.124 --> 58:00.024
- All right.
- Yeah?

58:00.057 --> 58:01.024
Yeah.

58:01.057 --> 58:02.124
Now your first gig shoots on
Saturday.

58:02.191 --> 58:03.725
I need you at the studio at 7:00
a.m.

58:03.758 --> 58:04.858
Wait, this Saturday?

58:05.691 --> 58:08.291
Yeah, this Saturday, what
kinda question is that?

58:08.324 --> 58:10.091
What time will we be finished?

58:10.124 --> 58:12.725
We finish when we finish.

58:13.792 --> 58:16.358
You know, you're making
me want a drink a lot.

58:16.391 --> 58:17.625
Hey Desiree, you coming?

58:18.558 --> 58:21.425
Bye, so nice to see you.

58:21.458 --> 58:23.425
I am so sorry about that.

58:24.691 --> 58:25.691
Mason is,

58:26.858 --> 58:28.691
well, he's not someone to
bring home to the family.

58:28.725 --> 58:30.591
So did everything get
resolved?

58:31.892 --> 58:32.991
More or less.

58:34.792 --> 58:37.689
He offered me a huge campaign.

58:37.691 --> 58:40.991
- Wow, congratulations.
- Thank you.

58:42.124 --> 58:44.258
Why aren't you happy about
that?

58:46.758 --> 58:49.758
The thing is the shoot is on
Saturday.

58:49.792 --> 58:51.856
So that means no Cirque.

58:51.858 --> 58:54.591
You know what, I don't
see any reason why the shoot

58:54.625 --> 58:57.689
can't be wrapped by the early
afternoon at the latest.

58:57.691 --> 59:00.224
I just don't want to
get Grace's hopes up.

59:00.258 --> 59:02.758
Hope, I completely understand

59:02.792 --> 59:05.425
and I promise you I will
not miss the show, okay?

59:05.458 --> 59:07.989
We are going to Cirque.

59:07.991 --> 59:11.591
I will walk off that set if I
have to.

59:13.991 --> 59:16.991
I will eat this nose, I
will swallow it whole.

59:17.024 --> 59:18.089
- I will gulp it down.
- Okay.

59:18.091 --> 59:19.625
- One gulp, no water.
- I get it.

59:19.658 --> 59:20.991
Gulp.

59:21.024 --> 59:23.758
Grace is gonna be
really happy about this.

59:26.758 --> 59:28.989
Where's my clown friend, where
is she?

59:28.991 --> 59:30.491
Are we folks ready to order?

59:30.525 --> 59:31.989
I believe we are, you know
what?

59:31.991 --> 59:35.491
I kinda feel like a Wedgie,
would you like a Wedgie?

59:35.525 --> 59:36.591
I'd love a Wedgie.

59:36.625 --> 59:38.658
We would both like to
start with a Wedgie, please.

59:38.691 --> 59:40.191
Okay, two Wedgies coming up.

59:42.991 --> 59:45.256
I'd like to
apologize for tonight.

59:45.258 --> 59:46.625
You mean the clown nose?

59:47.859 --> 59:49.991
Yeah, the clown nose.

59:51.991 --> 59:53.859
I would like to make it up to
you.

59:54.991 --> 59:56.825
We are going to Cirque on
Saturday.

59:58.024 --> 1:00:01.291
I actually just meant me and
you.

1:00:03.792 --> 1:00:04.625
Okay.

1:00:20.859 --> 1:00:21.758
Goodnight, Thomas.

1:00:27.792 --> 1:00:28.691
Goodnight, Hope.

1:00:54.124 --> 1:00:55.324
I haven't seen you this happy
since

1:00:55.358 --> 1:00:57.922
your 12th birthday when you
got that Super Nintendo.

1:00:57.924 --> 1:01:00.756
Oh, that was an awesome
birthday.

1:01:00.758 --> 1:01:03.158
Yeah, so you kissed her.

1:01:03.191 --> 1:01:05.656
Nope, nope, not going
there with you, Lawrence.

1:01:05.658 --> 1:01:07.989
Not going there with you.

1:01:07.991 --> 1:01:09.324
Yeah, you kissed her, you've
got

1:01:09.358 --> 1:01:11.991
that glowy Hope look in your
eyes.

1:01:12.024 --> 1:01:13.991
We are not 15 anymore,
Lawrence.

1:01:17.858 --> 1:01:20.324
♪ Thomas and Hope sittin' in a
tree ♪

1:01:20.358 --> 1:01:22.525
♪ K-I-S-S mm mm G ♪

1:01:22.558 --> 1:01:25.989
I take that back, one
of us isn't 15 anymore.

1:01:25.991 --> 1:01:28.391
Look, just don't tell Betty
'til after the photo shoot.

1:01:28.425 --> 1:01:30.425
I'm serious, bro, what's that
Bible verse

1:01:30.491 --> 1:01:32.591
about Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned?

1:01:32.658 --> 1:01:34.525
Shut up, Fabio.

1:01:38.057 --> 1:01:38.892
You think so?

1:01:53.024 --> 1:01:56.091
Hi, I'm Thomas McKenzie,
the photographer for today.

1:01:56.158 --> 1:01:58.057
Oh of course, right this way.

1:01:59.091 --> 1:02:01.989
Here we have our makeup
artist Lucy, our lounge

1:02:01.991 --> 1:02:04.825
for the models, the studio's
right around the corner.

1:02:04.892 --> 1:02:06.825
Oh, they're still bringing stuff
in

1:02:06.892 --> 1:02:09.792
but feel free to arrange
it however you wish.

1:02:09.825 --> 1:02:13.057
Our crafty is right here and
Mr. Campbell is right that way.

1:02:13.091 --> 1:02:15.726
- Thank you.
- Oh ho, Tommy boy.

1:02:15.759 --> 1:02:17.724
Glad to see you showed up.

1:02:17.726 --> 1:02:20.158
Today will be the day
you will never forget.

1:02:24.057 --> 1:02:25.890
What did he mean by that?

1:02:25.892 --> 1:02:27.726
Oh, that's just Mason being
Mason.

1:02:29.324 --> 1:02:31.825
How long do you think
this is gonna take?

1:02:31.892 --> 1:02:35.256
It's more take your time than
hurry up on days like this.

1:02:35.258 --> 1:02:36.258
Well you know models,

1:02:36.291 --> 1:02:38.324
can't even have the tiniest flaw
showing.

1:02:39.291 --> 1:02:40.158
It's just shoes, for goodness
sake.

1:02:40.224 --> 1:02:43.324
Bite thy tongue, Thomas, just
shoes?

1:02:43.391 --> 1:02:45.091
Hardly, why don't you go set up?

1:02:45.124 --> 1:02:48.892
I'm gonna go schmooze my
way into a pair of spandex.

1:02:48.991 --> 1:02:50.726
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1:03:11.291 --> 1:03:13.991
I never dreamed you
would be done this early.

1:03:15.057 --> 1:03:16.491
I am so sorry, Hope.

1:03:16.525 --> 1:03:18.358
The truth is we haven't even
started.

1:03:18.391 --> 1:03:20.458
What? Oh no.

1:03:20.491 --> 1:03:21.624
We actually should probably

1:03:21.626 --> 1:03:23.626
meet at the show just to be
safe.

1:03:25.324 --> 1:03:26.124
Thomas.

1:03:26.158 --> 1:03:28.456
I just want to cover our
bases.

1:03:28.458 --> 1:03:29.691
Actually I left the tickets

1:03:29.725 --> 1:03:31.291
somewhere on my desk at the
office.

1:03:31.324 --> 1:03:33.659
Would you mind stopping
by there on your way out?

1:03:33.691 --> 1:03:36.458
Sure, no problem.

1:03:36.491 --> 1:03:39.525
Thank you, Hope, I'm
going to make it, okay?

1:03:39.558 --> 1:03:42.525
Trust me, even if I,
I'm gonna eat that nose.

1:03:42.558 --> 1:03:44.792
Mr. McKenzie, the
models are ready for you.

1:03:44.825 --> 1:03:46.158
Thank you.

1:03:46.191 --> 1:03:48.124
All right, I gotta go.

1:03:48.158 --> 1:03:50.991
They're finally ready, I'll
see you soon, okay, bye.

1:03:55.291 --> 1:03:56.124
Ladies.

1:03:57.324 --> 1:03:58.291
This is gonna be the most

1:03:58.324 --> 1:04:00.725
talked about shoe campaign
in all of history.

1:04:03.458 --> 1:04:04.391
Nothing makes a woman feel

1:04:04.425 --> 1:04:06.191
sexier than a great pair of
shoes.

1:04:08.858 --> 1:04:11.191
Tommy boy, make your magic
happen, huh?

1:04:12.525 --> 1:04:14.858
All right, let's get started.

1:04:57.258 --> 1:04:59.189
Let's bring some more excitement
into it, some more energy.

1:04:59.191 --> 1:05:01.358
I want to see the confidence
that these shoes make

1:05:01.425 --> 1:05:04.989
you feel, don't be afraid
to smile, can we try that?

1:05:04.991 --> 1:05:06.625
Here we go.

1:05:06.658 --> 1:05:08.825
Maybe a little heel pop.

1:05:23.158 --> 1:05:23.991
This isn't working.

1:05:24.024 --> 1:05:25.425
All right, all right, all right.

1:05:25.458 --> 1:05:27.491
Ladies, that's all fun and
games for a nice little warmup

1:05:27.526 --> 1:05:30.792
but I'm gonna need you
guys to show us everything.

1:05:35.258 --> 1:05:37.425
Bam, that's what I'm talking
about.

1:05:37.458 --> 1:05:39.758
That's how you sell shoes, Tommy
boy.

1:05:39.792 --> 1:05:40.858
Just like that, it's beautiful,
beautiful, just like that.

1:05:42.492 --> 1:05:44.625
I'd buy a pair of those,
buy a pair of those.

1:05:44.658 --> 1:05:47.158
I'd buy my mother a pair
of those, that's for sure.

1:05:52.324 --> 1:05:53.158
Thomas.

1:05:54.258 --> 1:05:55.625
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

1:05:55.658 --> 1:05:56.458
What are they doing?

1:05:56.492 --> 1:05:58.124
I thought we were selling shoes.

1:05:58.158 --> 1:06:01.324
- They are selling shoes.
- No, no, they're selling sex.

1:06:01.358 --> 1:06:03.224
Yeah, well sex sells shoes and
sex

1:06:03.258 --> 1:06:04.823
sells my books and sex sells
everything.

1:06:04.825 --> 1:06:06.156
You know what, Desiree,
I can't believe this.

1:06:06.158 --> 1:06:07.358
You knew this was the campaign.

1:06:07.391 --> 1:06:09.024
You knew I wouldn't agree
to it but you still...

1:06:09.057 --> 1:06:10.258
Thomas, just please come back.

1:06:10.324 --> 1:06:12.156
I am begging you to finish the
shoot.

1:06:12.158 --> 1:06:13.892
I have staked my
reputation on you, please.

1:06:13.991 --> 1:06:15.691
Desiree, I am not gonna
compromise

1:06:15.725 --> 1:06:17.558
everything I am for a pair of
shoes.

1:06:17.591 --> 1:06:19.258
It's not just a pair of shoes,

1:06:19.324 --> 1:06:20.391
this is an Asher Di campaign...

1:06:20.425 --> 1:06:22.989
Is that supposed to mean
anything to me, is it?

1:06:22.991 --> 1:06:24.691
Because it doesn't, I don't
care.

1:06:24.725 --> 1:06:27.825
It's a huge opportunity
and I put myself on the line.

1:06:27.858 --> 1:06:29.792
Thank you, thank you
so much for everything

1:06:29.858 --> 1:06:31.656
you've done for me, Desiree,
everything but honestly...

1:06:31.658 --> 1:06:33.224
- But Mason...
- No thank you.

1:06:33.258 --> 1:06:36.224
You can tell Mason to
get a new boy, I'm done.

1:06:37.991 --> 1:06:38.858
Hey, hey!

1:06:40.591 --> 1:06:41.991
Are you kiddin' me?

1:06:42.024 --> 1:06:44.258
You blew it, kid, you're done.

1:06:44.324 --> 1:06:45.758
- Desiree, this is on you.
- What?

1:06:45.825 --> 1:06:47.656
That's your boy,
that's who you bring me?

1:06:47.658 --> 1:06:49.224
You know how much money that's
costing me?

1:06:49.258 --> 1:06:50.591
You're paying for this.

1:06:50.658 --> 1:06:51.892
People are gonna hear about
this, Desiree.

1:06:51.991 --> 1:06:54.057
Forget about it, you're
done, you are done.

1:07:03.459 --> 1:07:04.991
Gracie, I'm gonna
get you.

1:07:05.057 --> 1:07:06.591
No, you're not.

1:07:06.625 --> 1:07:07.825
Grace Elizabeth, stop.

1:07:08.991 --> 1:07:10.491
I'm sorry, mommy.

1:07:11.391 --> 1:07:13.324
Hope, is everything okay?

1:07:13.391 --> 1:07:15.989
Let's go, sweetie.

1:07:15.991 --> 1:07:17.625
You're all the same.

1:07:29.991 --> 1:07:31.224
What's up, Lawrence?

1:07:31.258 --> 1:07:33.758
Thomas, I don't know what
you were thinking, man.

1:07:33.792 --> 1:07:36.792
Hope just came by to pick up
the tickets in your office,

1:07:36.825 --> 1:07:41.792
so yeah, she met Betty, she
found your perfect girl journal.

1:07:42.258 --> 1:07:44.725
She left here crying and angry
and upset.

1:07:44.758 --> 1:07:47.291
I called Bev, I didn't
know what else to do.

1:07:55.324 --> 1:07:57.055
Wait Hope, you have to listen
to me.

1:07:57.057 --> 1:07:59.458
There's no reason for
me to stay here, Bev.

1:07:59.491 --> 1:08:01.057
But you don't have to go back
home.

1:08:01.124 --> 1:08:02.359
I shouldn't have come
in the first place.

1:08:02.392 --> 1:08:04.024
What are you talking about?

1:08:05.324 --> 1:08:07.725
I was just running away from
the truth.

1:08:07.792 --> 1:08:09.892
You told me you came here
to expand your business.

1:08:09.991 --> 1:08:11.625
That was just an
excuse.

1:08:12.991 --> 1:08:17.057
Girlfriend, what, tell
me, what is going on?

1:08:19.458 --> 1:08:21.392
He cheated on me, Bev.

1:08:21.458 --> 1:08:23.158
No, I'm sure there's an
explanation.

1:08:23.191 --> 1:08:25.456
Thomas just isn't like that.

1:08:25.458 --> 1:08:26.291
Darryl,

1:08:27.858 --> 1:08:29.291
Darryl cheated on me.

1:08:34.991 --> 1:08:37.456
I'm so sorry, honey.

1:08:43.458 --> 1:08:44.892
Hey, talk to me, girl.

1:08:48.825 --> 1:08:51.691
I found out right before the
accident.

1:08:53.124 --> 1:08:57.858
I got off work, I came home
and I found them in our bed.

1:08:59.358 --> 1:09:01.625
He was begging for me to stay.

1:09:01.691 --> 1:09:03.591
She was yelling at him all the
while

1:09:03.625 --> 1:09:05.458
I'm throwing his stuff out the
door.

1:09:06.591 --> 1:09:09.224
Thank God Grace was at my mom's.

1:09:09.258 --> 1:09:11.725
- So Gracie doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.

1:09:12.725 --> 1:09:13.558
Only me

1:09:15.091 --> 1:09:16.991
and that woman and God.

1:09:20.525 --> 1:09:22.892
I didn't think it mattered after
he died.

1:09:25.991 --> 1:09:29.259
I can't believe you're
carrying this all by yourself.

1:09:29.292 --> 1:09:32.024
I told him I never
wanted to see him again

1:09:35.525 --> 1:09:39.892
and that was the day that he
got hit on his motorcycle.

1:09:45.892 --> 1:09:47.356
Just relax, okay?

1:09:47.358 --> 1:09:48.358
I'll get it.

1:09:52.991 --> 1:09:53.989
- Oh no.
- No, no, no.

1:09:53.991 --> 1:09:55.689
You gotta let me in, I
can explain everything.

1:09:55.691 --> 1:09:57.124
This is not a good time,
Thomas.

1:09:57.191 --> 1:09:58.391
I need to talk to
her.

1:09:58.425 --> 1:09:59.858
Well you're just gonna
have to wait, okay?

1:09:59.892 --> 1:10:01.259
She's not ready to talk about
anything.

1:10:01.292 --> 1:10:02.924
If I can just tell her what
happened,

1:10:02.957 --> 1:10:05.022
- just tell her how I feel.
- You?

1:10:05.024 --> 1:10:08.124
This is not about how you feel,
this is about how she feels.

1:10:08.191 --> 1:10:09.558
If I can get her to understand
this,

1:10:09.591 --> 1:10:11.191
she won't feel this way anymore.

1:10:13.892 --> 1:10:16.024
Keep your voice down, Grace is
sleeping.

1:10:16.924 --> 1:10:17.924
I'm sorry.

1:10:18.858 --> 1:10:19.957
I can explain about the
painting.

1:10:20.024 --> 1:10:21.024
And the journal?

1:10:22.158 --> 1:10:26.691
Do you know how much you
hurt, how much you hurt Grace?

1:10:28.091 --> 1:10:30.625
There's nothing going
on between me and Desiree.

1:10:30.691 --> 1:10:32.259
Do you really believe that,
Thomas?

1:10:32.291 --> 1:10:36.190
You have a painting of her in
your office

1:10:36.192 --> 1:10:38.856
and a sketchbook filled
with pictures of her.

1:10:38.858 --> 1:10:39.856
Hope.

1:10:39.858 --> 1:10:41.758
And her perfume all
over you.

1:10:42.957 --> 1:10:44.057
Hope, Hope.

1:10:45.892 --> 1:10:46.725
Hope.

1:10:58.858 --> 1:11:03.324
I did exactly what anyone
in my position would do.

1:11:05.192 --> 1:11:08.989
Look, I just worked with
her, I worked with her.

1:11:08.991 --> 1:11:10.991
She looks just like the
painting, that's funny.

1:11:11.024 --> 1:11:12.258
That's funny, huh God?

1:11:12.291 --> 1:11:13.124
Yeah.

1:11:14.458 --> 1:11:18.525
Looks just like her
, that's a good joke.

1:11:19.658 --> 1:11:23.792
There was no commitment,
we didn't say what we were.

1:11:23.825 --> 1:11:28.589
I mean I probably should have
a little sooner but I didn't.

1:11:28.591 --> 1:11:30.792
I did nothing wrong.

1:11:30.825 --> 1:11:31.658
It's Hope.

1:11:34.324 --> 1:11:35.358
I wanna be with Hope.

1:11:37.425 --> 1:11:39.589
What is this, what?

1:11:39.591 --> 1:11:41.991
No, no, no.

1:11:42.024 --> 1:11:42.858
No.

1:11:44.358 --> 1:11:45.658
Oh come on, come on.

1:11:45.691 --> 1:11:46.691
No, no, no, no, no.

1:11:51.324 --> 1:11:52.159
Why?

1:12:23.991 --> 1:12:26.525
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:12:26.558 --> 1:12:29.224
Oh, you gotta be kidding me,
come on.

1:12:31.391 --> 1:12:32.658
Why?

1:13:05.558 --> 1:13:08.058
Excuse me, do you have a
phone I could use please?

1:13:08.892 --> 1:13:09.725
Thank you.

1:13:21.758 --> 1:13:23.825
I thought you were going to
the circus.

1:13:23.892 --> 1:13:25.725
Did you get lost along the way?

1:13:25.758 --> 1:13:27.224
Yes, I need a tow truck.

1:13:28.425 --> 1:13:29.991
Yes, I can hold.

1:13:32.324 --> 1:13:34.892
Look, I was thinking
about it on the drive home

1:13:34.991 --> 1:13:38.658
and well, it's kinda my
fault, the entire thing.

1:13:39.991 --> 1:13:42.056
Mason did tell me about his
plans

1:13:42.058 --> 1:13:45.224
for the shoot but I chose not to
tell you.

1:13:47.258 --> 1:13:48.391
Two hours?

1:13:50.224 --> 1:13:53.658
Yes, it's fine, I'm at the
Firehouse Bar on Third.

1:13:54.491 --> 1:13:55.391
Yeah, thanks.

1:13:56.992 --> 1:13:59.992
I honestly didn't think
it would be a big deal but

1:14:00.057 --> 1:14:03.625
I should've known you
would've had an issue with it.

1:14:05.124 --> 1:14:07.124
We both had a bad day, it seems.

1:14:08.858 --> 1:14:10.491
Hey, did you guys need a drink

1:14:10.525 --> 1:14:12.122
or you just needed to use the
phone?

1:14:12.124 --> 1:14:14.623
Yes, can I please get
another Old-Fashioned?

1:14:14.625 --> 1:14:17.025
- Yeah.
- And my treat,

1:14:17.057 --> 1:14:18.658
what are you having?

1:14:18.691 --> 1:14:20.324
Is this you apologizing?

1:14:21.458 --> 1:14:22.291
I guess.

1:14:24.892 --> 1:14:26.358
Fine, one drink.

1:14:28.792 --> 1:14:30.825
You strike me as a Jameson
man.

1:14:32.158 --> 1:14:33.992
Great, neat or on the rocks?

1:14:34.024 --> 1:14:35.792
- The rocks is fine.
- Okay.

1:14:35.825 --> 1:14:36.892
Ooh, rocks.

1:15:11.525 --> 1:15:12.358
What?

1:15:25.124 --> 1:15:25.991
Desiree.

1:15:27.858 --> 1:15:31.191
You're probably nursing a
king sized headache right now.

1:15:31.224 --> 1:15:34.425
How did I, why am I...

1:15:34.458 --> 1:15:37.893
Here, drink this, it'll
help you feel better.

1:15:38.991 --> 1:15:40.691
What happened

1:15:41.525 --> 1:15:42.989
last night?

1:15:42.991 --> 1:15:45.057
You don't remember?

1:15:45.091 --> 1:15:46.458
Well...

1:15:46.525 --> 1:15:47.291
Anything?

1:15:47.358 --> 1:15:49.358
I remember having a drink and
then

1:15:52.358 --> 1:15:55.057
I don't know, it's all a
little bit hazy after that.

1:15:55.091 --> 1:15:56.224
Turns out you do have quite

1:15:56.258 --> 1:15:59.291
the taste for Jameson but
not much of a tolerance.

1:15:59.358 --> 1:16:00.689
After three of those, I had to
get

1:16:00.691 --> 1:16:03.525
the bartender to help
me get you in the car

1:16:03.591 --> 1:16:05.591
and then I was gonna take you
home but...

1:16:12.191 --> 1:16:13.024
But what?

1:16:15.991 --> 1:16:16.825
Well,

1:16:19.358 --> 1:16:22.425
before I could get you there,
you threw up

1:16:22.458 --> 1:16:25.991
in the back seat of my car,
so I took you here instead.

1:16:31.091 --> 1:16:31.991
How did I,

1:16:34.758 --> 1:16:35.792
where are my clothes?

1:16:39.258 --> 1:16:42.591
They're in the wash, why
don't you take a shower?

1:16:42.625 --> 1:16:44.091
They should be ready by then.

1:17:03.525 --> 1:17:07.091
Hope, what a surprise, come on
in.

1:17:10.658 --> 1:17:11.658
What can I do for you?

1:17:11.691 --> 1:17:13.826
I just wanted to talk
to you for a moment.

1:17:14.691 --> 1:17:17.024
Look, I turned my life

1:17:17.057 --> 1:17:21.224
upside down to publish
and promote your book.

1:17:21.258 --> 1:17:23.989
I thought I was doing the right
thing.

1:17:23.991 --> 1:17:25.658
I believed that you were gonna
write

1:17:25.691 --> 1:17:29.324
something transformational in
young lives.

1:17:30.558 --> 1:17:33.658
But there is nothing
redeeming about this book.

1:17:35.358 --> 1:17:38.558
I never said I was going to
write a redeeming book, Hope.

1:17:38.591 --> 1:17:39.691
That's your word.

1:17:42.224 --> 1:17:45.091
I'm sorry Desiree, I
can't publish your book.

1:17:46.391 --> 1:17:48.725
You're saying no to a
bestseller

1:17:48.759 --> 1:17:50.691
because of your principles?

1:17:50.725 --> 1:17:53.825
I am saying no to your
book because I can't publish

1:17:53.858 --> 1:17:56.591
something that I wouldn't
want my own daughter to read.

1:17:58.425 --> 1:17:59.525
I can't force you to take
advantage

1:17:59.558 --> 1:18:01.491
of the opportunity of a
lifetime.

1:18:03.391 --> 1:18:05.558
Desiree, where did
you say my clothes are?

1:18:06.825 --> 1:18:08.124
Hope.

1:18:08.158 --> 1:18:09.625
Wait a minute, Hope.

1:18:09.658 --> 1:18:11.491
Don't go, Hope please.

1:18:15.057 --> 1:18:15.991
Hope, Hope.

1:18:21.591 --> 1:18:23.658
I need to borrow this, thank
you.

1:18:23.726 --> 1:18:26.224
Hey wait, that's my bicycle.

1:18:46.991 --> 1:18:48.759
Hope, wait.

1:18:52.224 --> 1:18:53.057
Hope.

1:19:05.291 --> 1:19:07.024
Come on, let's get you buckled
up.

1:19:09.892 --> 1:19:11.625
Oh, girlfriend.

1:19:24.291 --> 1:19:26.558
Are you sure about this?

1:19:26.625 --> 1:19:28.191
It's time to go home.

1:19:34.792 --> 1:19:38.224
Hope!

1:19:40.124 --> 1:19:43.892
Hope, Hope please, no, no,
Hope, don't go, please stay.

1:19:44.991 --> 1:19:46.289
We can talk about it, please.

1:19:46.291 --> 1:19:47.525
Don't go Hope, Hope.

1:19:50.458 --> 1:19:51.291
Hope!

1:19:52.858 --> 1:19:54.858
I want to say goodbye to
Thomas.

1:19:55.792 --> 1:19:57.491
I'm sorry, honey.

1:21:09.024 --> 1:21:11.191
I didn't do anything wrong,
dad.

1:21:11.224 --> 1:21:13.425
I mean this whole thing is
just a big misunderstanding.

1:21:13.458 --> 1:21:15.057
If she would just talk to me,

1:21:15.091 --> 1:21:17.391
I could tell her that I love
her.

1:21:17.425 --> 1:21:18.758
Didn't do anything wrong?

1:21:19.991 --> 1:21:21.856
You think just because
you didn't cross some

1:21:21.858 --> 1:21:24.989
forbidden line, you haven't
done anything wrong?

1:21:24.991 --> 1:21:28.258
You've spent so much
time, son, looking for

1:21:28.291 --> 1:21:32.559
what you wanted, what you
thought would make you happy.

1:21:33.425 --> 1:21:34.758
Did you pause for a minute

1:21:34.792 --> 1:21:36.525
and think about these other
girls,

1:21:37.391 --> 1:21:40.291
what they needed, what
they're looking for?

1:21:42.592 --> 1:21:45.291
Son, I'll tell you the truth,
you've just been selfish

1:21:46.224 --> 1:21:48.691
and that's the opposite of love.

1:21:48.725 --> 1:21:52.022
You need to start focusing on
your relationship with God.

1:21:52.024 --> 1:21:54.391
You want perfect, seek God.

1:21:54.425 --> 1:21:57.358
You want to find the best
relationship for you,

1:21:57.391 --> 1:22:00.691
you need to build your
relationship with Christ.

1:22:00.725 --> 1:22:04.158
'Cause if you try to find
someone on this Earth

1:22:04.191 --> 1:22:06.691
to fulfill the needs you
have really that only

1:22:06.758 --> 1:22:10.591
Christ can fulfill, you
will crush that person

1:22:10.625 --> 1:22:12.756
under the weight of your own
expectations

1:22:12.758 --> 1:22:14.291
and you know what's gonna happen
to you?

1:22:14.324 --> 1:22:16.258
You're gonna be bitter, really
bitter

1:22:17.191 --> 1:22:18.425
when they can't meet 'em.

1:22:19.625 --> 1:22:23.691
So what, you just want
me to give up on Hope?

1:22:23.758 --> 1:22:26.291
Just move on and forget about
it?

1:22:26.324 --> 1:22:29.989
No, I'm saying you need to
quit whining.

1:22:29.991 --> 1:22:30.858
You need to man up.

1:22:31.991 --> 1:22:34.858
Be the man that I've raised you
to be.

1:22:34.991 --> 1:22:38.089
You need to get up, you
need to press forward.

1:22:38.091 --> 1:22:39.792
You need to keep your eyes on
God.

1:22:43.792 --> 1:22:46.258
Hey, do you remember this?

1:22:49.091 --> 1:22:50.492
It's grandpa's compass.

1:22:52.091 --> 1:22:53.291
I always wanted to play with it

1:22:53.324 --> 1:22:55.089
as a kid but you wouldn't let me
touch it.

1:22:55.091 --> 1:22:56.792
Yeah, it was called wisdom.

1:22:59.425 --> 1:23:02.091
Hey Thomas, you know how much

1:23:02.158 --> 1:23:05.057
this means to me and
I want you to have it.

1:23:11.258 --> 1:23:15.492
Just let that remind you
to keep your focus on Him.

1:23:17.425 --> 1:23:18.991
Would you pray for me?

1:23:20.658 --> 1:23:21.492
I'd love to.

1:23:23.858 --> 1:23:25.758
Heavenly Father, thank you for
my son.

1:23:26.658 --> 1:23:31.057
Lord, I pray to you, just let
him see himself like you do.

1:24:08.224 --> 1:24:10.091
How can you say that about
Rochester?

1:24:10.124 --> 1:24:12.558
He adored Jane, he was just
afraid

1:24:12.591 --> 1:24:14.723
she wouldn't show him grace for
his flaw.

1:24:14.725 --> 1:24:18.057
That's plural, flaws, we're
talking about men here, right?

1:24:18.091 --> 1:24:19.556
And women.

1:24:19.558 --> 1:24:22.625
We are all flawed, right Hope?

1:24:22.658 --> 1:24:23.591
No one's perfect.

1:24:42.991 --> 1:24:43.758
Hello.

1:24:48.991 --> 1:24:49.792
Hello.

1:24:52.591 --> 1:24:53.658
I'm looking for Hope.

1:24:59.725 --> 1:25:00.558
Wait.

1:25:01.525 --> 1:25:03.124
Wait.

1:25:03.158 --> 1:25:04.991
I'm not letting you run away
from me.

1:25:05.991 --> 1:25:07.491
It's just like "Jerry
Maguire."

1:25:07.525 --> 1:25:08.691
Shh.

1:25:11.858 --> 1:25:12.792
Could we...

1:25:19.124 --> 1:25:19.991
Okay.

1:25:22.525 --> 1:25:24.191
You can be my cloud of
witnesses.

1:25:29.458 --> 1:25:30.291
Hope.

1:25:36.359 --> 1:25:39.024
I've spent my whole life

1:25:40.458 --> 1:25:41.792
just looking for something,

1:25:43.792 --> 1:25:46.391
trying to

1:25:46.458 --> 1:25:48.158
fill something in me.

1:25:50.124 --> 1:25:52.991
To protect myself from getting
hurt.

1:25:54.558 --> 1:25:55.391
I was blinded

1:25:57.458 --> 1:25:58.558
by my insecurities

1:26:00.124 --> 1:26:01.625
and my selfishness.

1:26:05.224 --> 1:26:06.725
But I didn't mean to hurt you.

1:26:13.358 --> 1:26:18.358
To be honest, I wasn't thinking
about anyone but myself.

1:26:21.725 --> 1:26:22.691
I promise

1:26:24.024 --> 1:26:26.224
that I am not that child
anymore.

1:26:29.292 --> 1:26:30.124
You see, God

1:26:31.358 --> 1:26:32.191
used you

1:26:34.625 --> 1:26:36.691
to reveal things to me about my
heart.

1:26:42.525 --> 1:26:45.691
I just feel terrible that it
took breaking yours to do it.

1:26:52.057 --> 1:26:56.057
I've thought about you
every day since you left.

1:27:05.425 --> 1:27:07.825
I'm not your perfect woman.

1:27:07.858 --> 1:27:10.124
I'm not your perfect man.

1:27:14.658 --> 1:27:15.591
But

1:27:15.625 --> 1:27:16.991
when I'm with you,

1:27:20.258 --> 1:27:21.324
I wanna try,

1:27:22.658 --> 1:27:23.525
I wanna be

1:27:24.825 --> 1:27:28.024
a better man so I can love you

1:27:30.158 --> 1:27:33.258
and Grace the way God intended.

1:27:37.591 --> 1:27:38.792
I love you, Hope.

1:27:51.991 --> 1:27:54.991
Many of us spend a whole
lifetime looking for love

1:27:55.758 --> 1:27:57.358
and for some us who find it,

1:27:57.425 --> 1:27:59.691
we're blessed and it has to be
shared.

1:28:01.358 --> 1:28:03.991
Thomas and Hope, you're doubly
blessed.

1:28:04.991 --> 1:28:07.491
Not only do you have the love of
Jesus

1:28:07.525 --> 1:28:11.391
but you've found each other
and now you get to spend

1:28:11.425 --> 1:28:15.558
a whole lifetime learning to
love one another just like

1:28:15.591 --> 1:28:20.591
Jesus loves you and if that's
not a reason to celebrate,

1:28:20.658 --> 1:28:22.825
then I don't know what is.
