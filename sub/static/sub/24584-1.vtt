00:55.404 --> 00:57.903
Alright, for those of
you who don't know me,

00:57.905 --> 01:01.250
I am Tom's better looking best friend man.

01:03.235 --> 01:05.022
We're very close to midnight so I wanted

01:05.025 --> 01:07.213
to get the hosts up here
'cause they have something

01:07.215 --> 01:08.825
special to say, Tom and Jess.

01:09.827 --> 01:12.193
Hey guys.

01:12.195 --> 01:16.043
So, as many of you know,
or probably don't know,

01:16.045 --> 01:20.333
over the past two years,
Jess and I have been having

01:20.335 --> 01:22.968
a lot of premarital sex.

01:25.045 --> 01:29.053
And I have come to this
conclusion, she is too good for me.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.205
- That's true.
- So...

01:32.105 --> 01:36.833
Me being as selfish as
I am, I proposed, and...

01:36.835 --> 01:37.921
She said yes.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.459
Alright that's enough.

01:44.294 --> 01:46.493
More importantly though,
let's raise our glass

01:46.495 --> 01:48.087
and cheers Tom and Jess.

01:48.089 --> 01:50.777
Cheers.

01:50.779 --> 01:52.353
Now everyone grab a kissing partner

01:52.355 --> 01:54.253
'cause it's almost the countdown,

01:54.255 --> 01:56.305
- get ready to smooch.
- Pair up, you two.

02:00.858 --> 02:01.955
Alright get ready, everyone.

02:03.412 --> 02:06.142
10, nine, eight,

02:06.144 --> 02:07.561
seven, six, five,

02:08.741 --> 02:10.158
four, three, two,

02:11.617 --> 02:13.284
one, happy New Year!

03:03.218 --> 03:04.051
No.

03:17.541 --> 03:18.541
More boob.

03:20.052 --> 03:21.155
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

03:41.885 --> 03:42.718
Wow.

03:44.205 --> 03:45.275
Are you serious?

03:46.355 --> 03:48.713
You'll have to fight guys off all night.

03:48.715 --> 03:50.365
- Girls too.
- I hope so.

03:51.635 --> 03:52.466
Okay.

03:52.468 --> 03:55.083
Yeah, we're gonna have fun
tonight and it looks like

03:55.085 --> 03:56.413
you're going golfing.

03:56.415 --> 03:57.433
All slutty.

03:57.435 --> 04:00.173
Slutty golfing's a real
thing, Kim, you know.

04:00.175 --> 04:02.623
All the wedges and the woods.

04:02.625 --> 04:03.935
Don't forget the holes.

04:03.937 --> 04:05.737
- Ah the holes.
- Okay they're fun.

04:07.365 --> 04:09.873
Alright guys have fun, take care of her.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.333
- Alright, gotta go.
- Okay, bye.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.023
Have fun tonight, touch some boobs.

04:14.025 --> 04:15.903
- Seriously?
- Of course.

04:15.905 --> 04:17.976
- Okay.
- Let's go, limo's waiting.

04:17.978 --> 04:18.978
- Hey!
- Hey!

04:22.111 --> 04:24.883
I'm so excited, I've
never been in a limo

04:24.885 --> 04:28.823
that wasn't headed to
a funeral or something.

04:28.825 --> 04:33.173
Oh shit, I forgot, we have
an extra stop to make.

04:33.175 --> 04:34.865
- Driver.
- Yes, ma'am.

04:34.867 --> 04:39.833
Can you make an extra stop
at the corner of Hadingfield.

04:39.835 --> 04:41.613
Yes, ma'am.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.693
Laura's in town and I
told her she could come.

04:43.695 --> 04:46.603
Excuse me, you did what?

04:46.605 --> 04:48.613
She's not that bad.

04:48.615 --> 04:52.283
She's creepy, like a child
stuck in an adult's body.

04:52.285 --> 04:54.303
Oh yeah, you know what else is creepy?

04:54.305 --> 04:56.013
Your mom still pays your rent.

04:56.015 --> 04:57.383
Yep.

04:57.385 --> 04:58.805
Don't be jealous.

04:59.745 --> 05:01.433
I think it's kind of
cool that you and Laura

05:01.435 --> 05:03.693
are engaged at the same time.

05:03.695 --> 05:05.503
Yeah, what a coincidence.

05:05.505 --> 05:07.513
So hostile.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.043
She's like a weird little unicorn kid.

05:10.045 --> 05:11.425
Very special.

05:12.415 --> 05:13.983
She's family.

05:13.985 --> 05:17.573
She's a stranger, you
don't know her or her fiance.

05:17.575 --> 05:20.435
So I'll get to know her and her fiance.

05:21.335 --> 05:23.105
Now let's drop it, we're here.

05:28.742 --> 05:30.180
Hi!

05:30.182 --> 05:31.182
Hi!

05:34.471 --> 05:35.304
- Hi!
- Hi!

05:36.476 --> 05:37.973
- Hi!
- Hi!

05:37.975 --> 05:41.143
Wow, look at you, beautiful as ever.

05:41.145 --> 05:42.445
Aw thank you.

05:44.585 --> 05:45.863
So now that we're all here,

05:45.865 --> 05:49.266
to my sister from another mister.

05:50.615 --> 05:51.615
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:54.635 --> 05:56.973
Thank you, this is way too much though.

05:56.975 --> 06:01.293
Please keep it, spend it on
something awesome, okay, like,

06:01.295 --> 06:02.964
hookers and blow or something.

06:05.235 --> 06:07.293
So it's like nothing much,

06:07.295 --> 06:09.145
but I heard you might like them.

06:11.625 --> 06:12.458
Aww.

06:18.065 --> 06:18.898
Aw, cute.

06:19.875 --> 06:22.313
I have the same one at home.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.815
Thank you, Laura, I love it.

06:26.405 --> 06:27.238
Oh.

06:30.485 --> 06:31.855
Holy cow.

06:33.565 --> 06:34.883
Tom gave you this?

06:34.885 --> 06:36.493
Well yeah.

06:36.495 --> 06:39.263
You weren't wearing
it at your little party.

06:39.265 --> 06:42.483
Well no, 'cause it was
supposed to be a surprise.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.635
Look at mine.

06:45.795 --> 06:48.293
Oh wow, Laura, that was your mom.

06:48.295 --> 06:50.893
Yeah, Peter, you know,
he went shopping for rings,

06:50.895 --> 06:54.065
but all the store bought
ones are so.

06:55.445 --> 06:57.533
He thought I deserved better.

06:57.535 --> 06:59.185
Well it is a pretty great ring.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.883
Kim, whatever happened to that guy

07:03.885 --> 07:06.843
that was pining after you
at the New Year's party?

07:06.845 --> 07:08.933
Which one?

07:08.935 --> 07:10.505
You had a nickname for him?

07:14.305 --> 07:17.595
Cries when he, you know.

07:20.238 --> 07:21.687
Fucks?

07:24.225 --> 07:26.533
Yeah, what happened to Roger?

07:26.535 --> 07:28.651
Why does he cry when he?

07:28.653 --> 07:30.127
- Fucks?
- Yeah.

07:32.475 --> 07:35.313
I don't know, it might be
Catholic guilt or something.

07:35.315 --> 07:38.203
Supposedly he ordains
weddings in his spare time,

07:38.205 --> 07:39.973
like who does that?

07:39.975 --> 07:41.835
Maybe he can ordain mine.

07:42.735 --> 07:43.568
Or mine.

07:45.085 --> 07:46.553
No, I don't know.

07:46.555 --> 07:50.543
We fucked one time and he just
laid there crying afterwards.

07:50.545 --> 07:52.763
Clearly it's 'cause
you're painfully tight.

07:52.765 --> 07:53.598
No.

07:54.645 --> 07:56.605
He got all clingy, so.

07:57.715 --> 07:59.395
I don't know, I just got up and left.

08:00.945 --> 08:02.055
That's awkward.

08:03.195 --> 08:06.323
Maybe it was a good experience for him

08:06.325 --> 08:08.633
and he thought it was beautiful.

08:08.635 --> 08:13.635
No, I was there, it wasn't
beautiful, it was very sad.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.975
He must be alone a lot.

08:22.955 --> 08:26.075
Alright, ladies, time to
get messy, let's roll out.

08:29.225 --> 08:30.275
Where are we going?

08:31.265 --> 08:33.293
To a dive bar.

08:33.294 --> 08:35.453
Why didn't we take the limo?

08:35.455 --> 08:37.543
Because the bar's just down the street

08:37.544 --> 08:39.794
and I need to work off
that food we just ate.

08:42.015 --> 08:42.847
And the wine.

08:44.335 --> 08:46.183
You smoke?

08:46.185 --> 08:47.803
Only when I drink.

08:47.805 --> 08:50.055
But she drinks all the time.

08:53.785 --> 08:55.883
Well look at this sorry group of guys.

08:55.885 --> 08:57.573
- Well hello ladies.
- How you doing?

08:57.575 --> 08:59.623
Are we enjoying ourselves tonight?

08:59.625 --> 09:01.083
Hello Jessica.

09:01.085 --> 09:02.673
Hi Charles.

09:02.675 --> 09:04.813
For God sake Jessica,
don't cover yourself up

09:04.815 --> 09:06.183
on my account.

09:06.185 --> 09:07.983
Never be ashamed of your sexuality.

09:07.985 --> 09:08.818
Dad!

09:10.405 --> 09:13.293
Oh Charles, she's
always had body issues,

09:13.295 --> 09:14.495
it's not because of you.

09:15.705 --> 09:16.538
Hi Tom.

09:18.829 --> 09:21.573
Would you guys mind if
I borrowed Jess for a sec?

09:21.575 --> 09:23.633
Ah, you have one minute max.

09:23.635 --> 09:25.065
We have an orgy to get to.

09:25.067 --> 09:25.984
Oh.

09:28.445 --> 09:30.495
I thought we were going to a dive bar.

09:33.405 --> 09:34.993
Well have
a good night, ladies.

09:34.995 --> 09:36.995
We'll see you down at the pub then, son.

09:40.385 --> 09:43.573
So, you guys look like you're
having a good time tonight.

09:43.575 --> 09:46.133
We are, are you?

09:46.135 --> 09:47.843
Why do you look so sober?

09:47.845 --> 09:50.323
'Cause I am, my boss called and I have

09:50.325 --> 09:52.303
to fly to Atlanta tomorrow morning.

09:52.305 --> 09:53.473
For how long?

09:53.475 --> 09:55.415
A couple days, maybe a week.

09:56.285 --> 09:59.093
No, I don't want you to go.

09:59.095 --> 10:02.323
And also I got a spider gag as a gift.

10:02.325 --> 10:03.725
I don't know what that is.

10:04.606 --> 10:06.380
Yeah, you do, we talked, you know the...

10:06.382 --> 10:07.715
- We did?
- Yeah.

10:09.895 --> 10:12.453
Oh.

10:12.455 --> 10:14.995
Okay then, I'm down.

10:18.665 --> 10:21.384
Can you at least come
say bye in the morning?

10:21.386 --> 10:24.104
I will, I promise,
I'll check in in the morning.

10:24.106 --> 10:25.203
Okay?

10:25.205 --> 10:27.883
And listen, I want you to
have a really good time tonight

10:27.885 --> 10:31.393
and, go see some big boobs.

10:31.395 --> 10:33.353
It's not a bachelor party unless you get

10:33.355 --> 10:34.583
to see some big boobs.

10:34.585 --> 10:36.465
Then let me see your boobs.

10:37.982 --> 10:39.403
You need to get out more.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.133
Alright, break it up.

10:41.135 --> 10:42.523
Aw, I gotta go.

10:42.525 --> 10:44.413
Gotta go see some boobs.

10:44.415 --> 10:45.583
Yeah, if I'm lucky.

10:45.585 --> 10:47.585
- Listen, I love you.
- I love you.

10:50.923 --> 10:53.065
- Go have fun.
- Okay.

11:14.403 --> 11:15.931
There she is.

11:15.933 --> 11:16.766
Hey.

11:17.855 --> 11:19.433
I'm so sorry I couldn't be here earlier.

11:19.435 --> 11:22.013
Mike sucks, I swear he can't.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.873
I'm just glad that you're here

11:23.875 --> 11:25.613
and you're not pregnant.

11:25.615 --> 11:27.223
You're not are you?

11:27.225 --> 11:30.713
God no, he keeps trying
but I just drove myself

11:30.715 --> 11:31.733
through birth controls pills.

11:31.735 --> 11:35.423
Tricking your husband into
lots of sex for no reason.

11:35.425 --> 11:37.607
- I like it.
- It's the only way.

11:37.609 --> 11:39.483
Hey what can I get you ladies?

11:39.485 --> 11:41.365
Everyone or just me?

11:42.695 --> 11:44.993
Tray of tequila, ladies?

11:44.995 --> 11:46.783
And a bunch of beer to wash it down.

11:46.785 --> 11:48.033
You got it, yeah.

11:48.035 --> 11:50.063
Wow, this place.

11:50.065 --> 11:51.865
I actually have something for you.

11:54.729 --> 11:57.423
Oh my god, I forgot about that.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.513
Consider the torch passed.

11:59.515 --> 12:00.348
What's that?

12:01.225 --> 12:02.973
It's a game that we've
been playing for years.

12:02.975 --> 12:04.663
It's called Hens Night.

12:04.665 --> 12:07.963
We've been adding to it, and
it's kind of our tradition.

12:07.965 --> 12:09.515
It's kind of like dare cards.

12:12.005 --> 12:13.473
Who goes first?

12:13.475 --> 12:15.613
Do I have to play?

12:15.615 --> 12:17.756
Yes, but I'll go first.

12:23.043 --> 12:28.043
Get the waiter's phone number, no problem.

12:28.055 --> 12:29.395
That says bartender.

12:30.985 --> 12:32.435
But I prefer the waiter.

12:33.597 --> 12:35.993
Alright, here we go everybody.

12:35.995 --> 12:38.111
Beers are on their way
and is there anything else

12:38.113 --> 12:40.171
I can get you guys?

12:40.173 --> 12:42.385
How about your phone number?

12:43.355 --> 12:47.223
My phone number, my god,
you think I'm that easy?

12:47.225 --> 12:48.975
I'm willing to bet on it.

12:50.525 --> 12:52.465
Damn you, all right.

12:53.675 --> 12:55.723
Oh do you want my name.

12:55.725 --> 12:56.558
Sure.

12:59.055 --> 13:01.080
- Here we go lovely.
- Thank you.

13:01.082 --> 13:03.203
You're welcome, sweetie.

13:03.205 --> 13:04.315
Good job.

13:06.532 --> 13:09.095
No, I can't do it.

13:11.335 --> 13:12.285
I know that look.

13:13.355 --> 13:14.188
What's wrong?

13:15.585 --> 13:18.173
- Shitty name?
- Yep.

13:18.175 --> 13:19.565
It's Stacey.

13:23.385 --> 13:26.159
Task completed, Holly's next.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.713
Take a shot every time
someone says something

13:31.715 --> 13:33.431
they hate about weddings.

13:33.433 --> 13:35.613
Oh my god, for the rest of the night.

13:35.615 --> 13:36.775
Yes.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.083
But since you have a lot
of catching up to do,

13:40.085 --> 13:42.433
you have to take a shot
every time we mention

13:42.435 --> 13:45.083
something we hated about your wedding.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.563
Oh well I'm gonna be sober

13:46.565 --> 13:48.685
'cause my wedding was amazing.

13:51.135 --> 13:52.835
Fucking doves.

13:55.049 --> 13:56.423
You bitch.

13:56.425 --> 13:58.203
You released doves?

13:58.205 --> 13:59.863
I'm afraid so.

13:59.865 --> 14:01.635
Oh I think that's really sweet.

14:02.975 --> 14:06.372
Not as sweet as your
gropey Uncle Francis.

14:06.374 --> 14:07.541
Fair enough.

14:10.265 --> 14:12.023
Alright I'm gonna break the seal.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.755
No more tasks until I get back.

14:18.735 --> 14:20.288
The queen has left the building.

14:23.545 --> 14:27.643
This is so much fun,
thank you for inviting me.

14:27.645 --> 14:29.253
I'm really glad you're
having a good time.

14:29.255 --> 14:32.013
I am, like I never get
to do stuff like this,

14:32.015 --> 14:36.915
like fancy restaurants
and limo rides and...

14:38.165 --> 14:39.925
Fun games.

14:41.155 --> 14:44.685
I sort of wish I had friends
that would do this for me.

14:45.615 --> 14:47.865
Your friends aren't
doing anything for you?

14:49.065 --> 14:51.785
No, I don't actually have friends.

14:53.255 --> 14:54.613
That sucks.

14:54.615 --> 14:56.223
I'm so sorry.

14:56.225 --> 14:59.935
Oh it's okay, you know,
I keep myself busy with...

15:01.365 --> 15:06.015
Cooking and painting
ceramics and stuff like that.

15:12.915 --> 15:15.735
Maybe we could do something for you.

15:16.715 --> 15:19.413
You'd throw me a bachelorette party?

15:19.415 --> 15:21.853
Yeah, I mean we could
figure something out.

15:21.855 --> 15:24.955
Oh my god, this is so amazing.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.583
We could have a total slumber party

15:27.585 --> 15:29.425
and everyone could come.

15:30.455 --> 15:33.065
I like always wanted to
have a slumber party.

15:35.925 --> 15:38.453
Yeah, that sounds like it could be fun.

15:38.455 --> 15:41.703
We could have cocktails
and talk all night

15:41.705 --> 15:44.555
and just have fun, you know,
like when we were kids.

15:45.895 --> 15:48.045
Yeah, like when we were kids, sure.

15:50.225 --> 15:53.113
You girls are so amazing,
like I'll make sure

15:53.115 --> 15:56.065
to have the whole place
cleaned for next Saturday.

15:57.955 --> 15:59.175
Next Saturday.

16:00.995 --> 16:03.625
Sorry, I'm busy next Saturday.

16:04.821 --> 16:06.413
Oh.

16:06.415 --> 16:09.393
I don't know, Laura, next
week's the only weekend

16:09.395 --> 16:10.813
I have left before the wedding,

16:10.815 --> 16:13.015
and there's so much to do.

16:13.975 --> 16:16.123
Oh but it has to be next Saturday,

16:16.125 --> 16:17.725
I get married on Sunday.

16:19.625 --> 16:20.863
What?

16:20.865 --> 16:21.895
This Sunday.

16:23.255 --> 16:25.833
So you're getting married
the weekend before me

16:25.835 --> 16:28.983
and this is the first
I've heard about this?

16:28.985 --> 16:33.623
It was kind of the only
weekend that worked for Peter

16:33.625 --> 16:36.283
and he's always traveling.

16:36.285 --> 16:37.515
Was I even invited?

16:38.935 --> 16:41.673
Peter kind of wanted to keep it small.

16:41.675 --> 16:43.183
But you know this would be great,

16:43.185 --> 16:45.473
it would be even better
'cause then you guys

16:45.475 --> 16:48.573
could come for the slumber
party and then stay

16:48.575 --> 16:49.485
for the wedding.

16:52.605 --> 16:56.265
It would really mean a lot
for me if you were there.

17:02.515 --> 17:06.313
Um, well then we'll go up there

17:06.315 --> 17:10.050
and we'll throw you the
best bachelorette party

17:10.053 --> 17:12.275
anyone has ever had.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.532
I'm so excited, I can't wait for this!

17:15.535 --> 17:20.143
This is gonna be so much fun,
I'm so happy, I'm so happy.

17:20.145 --> 17:21.573
I can't wait.

17:21.575 --> 17:23.083
What's everyone so excited about?

17:23.085 --> 17:24.443
About the slumber party

17:24.444 --> 17:25.944
we're gonna have next weekend.

17:27.325 --> 17:29.273
What the fuck is she talking about?

17:29.275 --> 17:31.015
We'll talk later.

17:31.017 --> 17:32.515
Okay my turn.

17:35.935 --> 17:39.095
Give another hen a sexy lap dance.

17:41.035 --> 17:42.825
- You down?
- Oh I'm down.

17:45.475 --> 17:48.191
So what the hell
happened while I was gone?

19:13.394 --> 19:14.561
- Yeah.
- Nice.

19:15.398 --> 19:17.065
- Take it off.
- Woo!

19:34.124 --> 19:36.796
Go girl!

20:13.775 --> 20:15.563
I'm no expert but I don't think

20:15.565 --> 20:17.605
that whole dance was necessary.

20:18.835 --> 20:21.555
But you know, Jess has
always loved the attention.

20:26.273 --> 20:29.215
Ah, nice seeing exes getting along.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.445
Exes?

20:32.435 --> 20:33.268
This is gold.

20:34.315 --> 20:37.073
Laura, you didn't know
your cousin was a lesbian?

20:37.075 --> 20:38.445
I wasn't a lesbian.

20:39.465 --> 20:40.893
I'm a lesbian.

20:40.895 --> 20:41.728
See.

20:42.635 --> 20:45.933
We had a brief fling
when we were younger.

20:45.935 --> 20:47.793
You loved it.

20:47.795 --> 20:50.985
Okay I'm not a lesbian,
but I test drove one.

20:52.025 --> 20:54.965
Then she went back to dick, for shame.

20:56.155 --> 20:58.753
Expensive gift registry.

20:58.755 --> 20:59.945
What the fuck?

21:03.651 --> 21:06.556
I couldn't even tell
that you were a lesbo.

21:06.558 --> 21:09.558
- Thank you, Laura.
- You're welcome.

21:12.525 --> 21:14.723
Laurie, you ready for your turn?

21:14.725 --> 21:16.245
Yeah, actually this is fun.

21:21.835 --> 21:25.553
Ask a guy or a girl in the bar to dance.

21:25.555 --> 21:26.388
Oh!

21:27.332 --> 21:28.993
Who are you gonna ask?

21:28.995 --> 21:30.643
What about the
hottie in the black shirt,

21:30.645 --> 21:31.478
he's really hot.

21:32.545 --> 21:34.695
You are drunk, he's clearly.

21:37.625 --> 21:40.143
Oh what about the waiter?

21:40.145 --> 21:44.307
Ew, no, no one wants your leftover.

21:44.309 --> 21:45.726
What about him?

21:48.762 --> 21:50.281
Oh nice, do it.

21:50.283 --> 21:52.045
Yeah, get over there before I do.

21:53.155 --> 21:54.635
But what do I say?

21:55.665 --> 21:58.263
Simple, just introduce yourself,

21:58.265 --> 22:01.915
give him a compliment and
then you two can get busy.

22:01.917 --> 22:05.263
What! No!

22:05.265 --> 22:10.005
It's true, men like
their big fat ego stroked.

22:11.255 --> 22:12.953
'Kay, I'll give it a shot.

22:12.955 --> 22:16.715
Yeah, go, you look amazing.

22:17.878 --> 22:18.905
Whoops.

22:25.776 --> 22:27.913
Oh my god, she actually
looks like she's having fun

22:27.915 --> 22:31.214
in her own little weird
unicorn loving way.

22:31.216 --> 22:34.315
I know, I can't believe she's
actually playing the game.

22:39.155 --> 22:41.507
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

22:41.509 --> 22:43.403
Hi.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.356
You look really good.

22:45.358 --> 22:46.191
I'm sorry?

22:49.535 --> 22:51.813
I really like your hair.

22:51.815 --> 22:54.372
Oh thank you, it sort of grew that way.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.485
That's funny.

22:59.659 --> 23:02.535
Do you, do you want to dance?

23:03.515 --> 23:06.605
Um, I don't think I've had
enough to drink for that yet.

23:08.175 --> 23:09.475
Oh, we could drink more?

23:11.295 --> 23:14.653
Actually, do you think
you could introduce me

23:14.655 --> 23:17.063
to that red head at your
table that was doing

23:17.065 --> 23:19.955
that sort of sexy dance?

23:21.177 --> 23:22.525
I think I'm ready for her.

23:29.065 --> 23:30.545
Um, Kim.

23:33.595 --> 23:34.428
Fuck!

23:36.155 --> 23:38.535
Ah man, I'm gonna go with her.

23:43.735 --> 23:44.723
What the fuck?

23:44.725 --> 23:48.775
I have never been so
humiliated in all my life.

23:50.775 --> 23:52.495
What happened?

23:54.540 --> 23:58.393
Apparently he liked your slutty dance.

23:58.395 --> 24:01.253
What, fuck that guy, he's an asshole.

24:01.255 --> 24:03.875
He's not the problem,
you're the problem.

24:04.925 --> 24:05.865
Excuse me?

24:08.665 --> 24:10.553
Oh, Kim, hi.

24:10.555 --> 24:12.053
What the fuck are you doing here?

24:12.055 --> 24:14.473
I'm having drinks with my friends.

24:14.475 --> 24:16.193
Yeah, that's pretty fucking convenient.

24:16.195 --> 24:17.503
I didn't know you were here.

24:17.505 --> 24:19.483
Don't bullshit me.

24:19.485 --> 24:22.493
You mean to tell me you didn't
notice the dirty dancing bit?

24:22.495 --> 24:24.863
I saw that, but before
that, I swear to god

24:24.865 --> 24:26.863
I had no clues you were here.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.725
Your friend here's a real creep.

24:30.625 --> 24:32.973
Roger, if you don't stop stalking me,

24:32.975 --> 24:34.575
I'm gonna call the fucking cops.

24:38.725 --> 24:40.135
It's all your fault.

24:41.005 --> 24:44.383
You ruined my dare because
you need attention from men!

24:44.385 --> 24:46.935
What the fuck, don't make this about me.

24:46.937 --> 24:50.613
It is about you, it's
always been about you

24:50.615 --> 24:52.032
our entire lives!

24:54.195 --> 24:58.453
I'm fucking sick of your
bullshit jealousy, okay?

24:58.455 --> 25:00.918
It stops now, why do you
think I stopped talking

25:00.920 --> 25:03.087
to you in the first place?

25:04.400 --> 25:07.513
I don't know what a great guy like Tom

25:07.515 --> 25:09.415
sees in a whore like you.

25:11.645 --> 25:12.478
Whore.

25:13.345 --> 25:17.573
That's nice and um, what does your fiance

25:17.575 --> 25:19.983
see in you exactly?

25:19.985 --> 25:22.525
He loves me the way
that you'll never know!

25:24.825 --> 25:26.545
You'll never have what I have.

25:33.605 --> 25:36.175
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.

25:39.465 --> 25:41.265
Thank you so much for inviting me.

25:49.235 --> 25:50.235
Where's she going?

25:51.225 --> 25:52.345
Where are you going?

25:53.966 --> 25:55.493
What the hell happened?

25:55.495 --> 25:57.143
Family squabble.

25:57.145 --> 25:59.175
Every fucking time I leave the table.

26:03.663 --> 26:06.123
That fucking bitch.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.675
Where does she get the
nerve, this is your night.

26:09.849 --> 26:10.983
It's okay.

26:10.985 --> 26:15.263
No it's not okay, selfish cunt!

26:15.265 --> 26:17.123
Please don't say that word.

26:17.125 --> 26:19.203
I'm sorry, but I'm really pissed

26:19.205 --> 26:22.453
and it seemed like the
only appropriate word.

26:22.455 --> 26:25.923
I just, I have so little family left

26:25.925 --> 26:28.805
that I thought if she
came it would be good.

26:30.855 --> 26:35.075
I'm just so sick of tip toeing around her.

26:36.702 --> 26:39.165
You're a good person,
much better than me.

26:40.395 --> 26:42.100
You're not the problem here for once.

26:46.155 --> 26:48.845
We've been through weirder
and worse shit together.

26:49.805 --> 26:52.443
I say we fix up your make up,

26:52.445 --> 26:55.823
hike up that skirt,
make yourself look good,

26:55.825 --> 26:59.545
and let's celebrate your last
night of freedom in style.

27:00.585 --> 27:02.535
- Alright.
- Let's go party and dance.

28:44.235 --> 28:46.835
That tasted so much better going down.

28:49.243 --> 28:51.999
Here you go.

28:52.001 --> 28:53.001
Thank you.

28:55.385 --> 28:58.445
How are you not sick, you
drank more than I did.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.633
That's because you're a light weight.

29:01.635 --> 29:03.895
I'm a fucking drinking sensei.

29:05.665 --> 29:08.043
I used to be a sensei.

29:08.045 --> 29:10.265
You did used to be a sensei.

29:11.425 --> 29:12.815
You were one of the best.

29:15.665 --> 29:17.205
I'm sad.

29:19.015 --> 29:22.233
You and your big, stupid, fat heart.

29:22.235 --> 29:24.803
You care too much.

29:24.805 --> 29:28.793
I care about you.

29:28.795 --> 29:30.355
You better care about me.

29:31.355 --> 29:36.355
I rent you a fucking limo,
put up with your crazy cousin.

29:36.435 --> 29:37.266
Mm-hm.

29:46.723 --> 29:47.640
I love you.

29:48.525 --> 29:49.942
I love you too.

30:56.865 --> 30:58.263
Finally.

30:58.265 --> 30:59.843
You gonna shut up now?

30:59.845 --> 31:01.045
Not another peep.

31:04.865 --> 31:06.493
How far are we?

31:06.495 --> 31:08.043
I'm not even sure we're
going the right way.

31:08.045 --> 31:09.173
We're going the right way.

31:09.175 --> 31:10.006
You sure?

31:10.008 --> 31:12.893
Yes I'm sure, trust me, I've
been here a million times.

31:12.895 --> 31:14.633
Not since puberty.

31:14.635 --> 31:17.155
Less talking, more peeing.

31:29.825 --> 31:31.525
No, what if I get pulled over?

31:32.505 --> 31:34.943
Come on, Mrs. Paul, live on the edge.

31:34.945 --> 31:36.613
No one patrols out here.

31:36.615 --> 31:38.773
Stop being judgey.

31:38.775 --> 31:40.375
You are such an old.

31:42.677 --> 31:44.825
Plus no one said you had
to drink the whole bottle.

31:46.035 --> 31:47.765
I need the liquid courage.

31:49.152 --> 31:51.152
Then why are we even doing this?

31:53.055 --> 31:54.495
Because we said we would.

31:55.535 --> 31:58.133
That was before she
went all she-Hulk on you.

31:58.135 --> 32:00.203
Doesn't that like void
any contract you may

32:00.205 --> 32:01.403
have had with her?

32:01.405 --> 32:03.795
Yeah, I'm with Kim on this one.

32:03.797 --> 32:05.783
We already talked about this.

32:05.785 --> 32:07.533
Hi Jess, it's Laura.

32:07.535 --> 32:09.533
Just wanted to say I had such a great time

32:09.535 --> 32:12.030
last weekend and I hope you guys know that

32:12.032 --> 32:13.833
you know next weekend we're gonna have

32:13.835 --> 32:15.583
a super great time, don't bring anything.

32:15.585 --> 32:17.333
I have everything prepared for us,

32:17.335 --> 32:19.035
so I'll see you soon, bye.

32:20.805 --> 32:24.193
Wow it's almost like nothing happened.

32:24.195 --> 32:25.905
Because she's insane.

32:27.325 --> 32:28.585
In the membrane.

32:30.795 --> 32:31.825
Come on, you guys.

32:37.445 --> 32:39.173
So do we have to stay the whole time

32:39.175 --> 32:41.993
for you to make good on the pot and booze?

32:41.995 --> 32:44.413
Fuck that, I say she forks it over now.

32:44.415 --> 32:45.763
We'll need it.

32:45.765 --> 32:46.783
How bad could it be?

32:46.785 --> 32:50.253
We put cucumber slices on
our eyes and mud on our face.

32:50.255 --> 32:52.323
And we talk about our hopes and dreams

32:52.325 --> 32:54.443
and then we have a tickle fight.

32:54.445 --> 32:56.321
So down for a tickle fight.

32:57.775 --> 33:00.714
No seriously guys I know
the way this is gonna end.

33:00.716 --> 33:03.375
It always ends the same with Laura.

33:08.355 --> 33:11.585
Can we have a sleepover at your house?

33:11.587 --> 33:14.195
Okay sure I'll go ask my mom.

33:17.465 --> 33:20.823
And just when we started
to have normal kid fun.

33:20.825 --> 33:22.726
So how bad was your report card?

33:22.728 --> 33:25.021
Bad.

33:25.023 --> 33:27.795
- Mine was good.
- That's good Laura.

33:31.578 --> 33:33.363
- I'm all...
- Here, all done Jessie.

33:33.365 --> 33:35.135
Aw, thanks.

33:37.305 --> 33:38.973
I'm going home!

33:38.975 --> 33:39.843
No.

33:39.845 --> 33:41.735
I said I'm going home!

33:50.695 --> 33:52.013
I doubt she'll be calling her mom

33:52.015 --> 33:53.495
to come pick her up tonight.

33:54.545 --> 33:55.785
Well her mom's dead.

33:57.425 --> 33:58.375
That'd be creepy.

33:59.405 --> 34:02.543
If my zombie aunt shows up
at the cottage this weekend,

34:02.545 --> 34:03.615
it'll be a success.

34:05.395 --> 34:08.208
One weekend, how bad could it be?

34:08.210 --> 34:11.960
We need the
booze and drugs up front.

34:59.855 --> 35:00.688
Laura?

35:11.845 --> 35:12.678
Laura?

35:23.755 --> 35:26.023
This place is kind of cute.

35:26.025 --> 35:27.175
is shit.

35:31.797 --> 35:32.630
Laura?

36:15.919 --> 36:16.752
Jess!

36:20.115 --> 36:21.373
Hey.

36:21.375 --> 36:23.055
So good to see you.

36:24.635 --> 36:25.893
Is it?

36:25.895 --> 36:27.925
Of course it is, I'm...

36:29.105 --> 36:32.753
I'm just so thankful
that you know you came

36:32.755 --> 36:34.405
and you brought your friends.

36:35.395 --> 36:37.513
Well I brought Kim, so.

36:37.515 --> 36:41.145
Well I'm sure she has a
few redeeming qualities.

36:43.245 --> 36:44.078
Listen.

36:45.165 --> 36:46.053
About last time...

36:46.055 --> 36:48.863
Oh, let's not talk about it, Jess, okay.

36:48.865 --> 36:51.143
I just wanna have a good time this weekend

36:51.145 --> 36:53.045
and I'm really, really sorry.

36:53.975 --> 36:58.435
Come on, I'm just happy that
my family is here with me.

37:04.885 --> 37:05.785
Should we go in?

37:07.915 --> 37:09.965
Yeah I really wanna see everyone.

37:23.425 --> 37:25.083
Hi ladies.

37:25.085 --> 37:27.865
Oh hi Laura, you two good?

37:28.778 --> 37:30.005
Of course we're good.

37:33.065 --> 37:33.898
We're good.

37:35.235 --> 37:37.245
Okay I'm gonna make some drinks.

37:45.095 --> 37:47.163
This is a really nice cottage, Laura.

37:47.165 --> 37:49.003
Do you stay here all summer?

37:49.005 --> 37:51.375
Yeah, yeah, well
actually all year round.

37:52.475 --> 37:55.803
You must have to commute
pretty far, what do you do?

37:55.805 --> 37:57.155
Yeah, I don't have a job.

37:58.025 --> 38:00.418
I have a lot of health problems.

38:00.420 --> 38:05.273
My interstitial cystitis that's
what keeps me home mostly.

38:05.275 --> 38:06.633
Huh?

38:06.635 --> 38:09.243
It's a disease that causes discomfort

38:09.245 --> 38:10.545
in and around the bladder.

38:13.235 --> 38:14.068
I'm a nurse.

38:15.625 --> 38:17.223
You're a nurse?

38:17.225 --> 38:19.695
Wow, I would've liked to be a nurse.

38:21.945 --> 38:25.653
So tell us about your
fiance, what's he like?

38:25.655 --> 38:29.633
Oh he's cute, really funny, very nice.

38:29.635 --> 38:32.065
He makes you feel comfortable right away.

38:33.075 --> 38:34.325
Can't wait to meet him.

38:35.442 --> 38:39.463
Oh I'm just a little sad though.

38:39.465 --> 38:41.963
Yeah, like we won't be able
to have our first dance

38:41.965 --> 38:44.803
for awhile, he had this accident

38:44.805 --> 38:47.223
and he broke both his knees.

38:47.225 --> 38:51.513
Holy shit, Laura, that's like
a long, long recovery time.

38:51.515 --> 38:54.413
I know and that's what I told him.

38:54.415 --> 38:57.603
But he loves me and he just
wants to get married right away.

38:57.605 --> 38:58.438
Wow.

38:59.885 --> 39:01.843
Yeah, he loves me a lot.

39:01.845 --> 39:03.853
Yeah, it sounds like it.

39:03.855 --> 39:05.313
You know, this knee thing,

39:05.315 --> 39:06.833
could really ruin your sex life.

39:06.835 --> 39:08.353
Kim!

39:08.355 --> 39:09.903
What, it's true.

39:09.905 --> 39:10.993
I mean there's not much that you can do

39:10.995 --> 39:12.263
with a guy with broken knees

39:12.265 --> 39:16.205
like blowjobs or hand
jobs, but that's about it.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.025
I like blowjobs.

39:23.055 --> 39:24.245
Cheers.

39:28.305 --> 39:30.973
So, um...

39:30.975 --> 39:34.326
This wedding tomorrow, you
gonna have an open bar?

39:34.328 --> 39:35.161
Hm?

39:36.465 --> 39:38.733
Your wedding tomorrow.

39:38.735 --> 39:40.955
Oh yeah, there'll be drinks.

39:42.015 --> 39:46.593
Awesome 'cause I know someone
who's cheaping out on us.

39:46.595 --> 39:49.633
I'm sorry, weddings are expensive.

39:49.635 --> 39:52.273
Don't worry, it's my
job as maid of honor

39:52.275 --> 39:55.023
to make sure that you have a
drink in your hand all night.

39:55.025 --> 39:57.213
So I'll bring my own supply.

39:57.215 --> 39:58.565
Kim's your maid of honor?

40:01.935 --> 40:04.093
Yeah, we've been friends
since we were little.

40:04.095 --> 40:05.135
You know this.

40:06.875 --> 40:09.993
No, that makes sense.

40:09.995 --> 40:11.595
I mean she's almost like family.

40:14.411 --> 40:16.578
I'm gonna go get the food.

40:43.754 --> 40:48.293
Wow, you guys didn't
have to do this for me.

40:48.295 --> 40:49.865
It's so nice.

40:49.867 --> 40:50.965
Of course we did.

40:52.265 --> 40:54.373
Every girl who gets married
has to get some sort

40:54.375 --> 40:55.685
of special gifts.

40:57.085 --> 40:59.733
See, what if I never get married?

40:59.735 --> 41:01.833
You know I never get one
of those good for you

41:01.835 --> 41:04.205
for being awesome and single gifts.

41:06.415 --> 41:07.925
Consider this a gift.

41:12.395 --> 41:15.863
No but seriously, I
spend thousands of dollars

41:15.865 --> 41:19.372
every year on weddings, baby showers,

41:19.374 --> 41:22.965
birthdays and a whole pile of other shit.

41:23.825 --> 41:25.825
You know, what if I never do that stuff?

41:26.695 --> 41:29.445
You know, who's gonna spend
thousands of dollars on me?

41:30.685 --> 41:32.213
What do I get?

41:32.215 --> 41:33.465
Peace and quiet?

41:35.782 --> 41:36.613
Nice.

41:36.615 --> 41:38.823
There's no way you've
ever been to a baby shower.

41:38.825 --> 41:41.523
Yes I have.

41:41.525 --> 41:43.883
I love those little church lady

41:43.885 --> 41:45.533
sandwiches, they're delicious.

41:45.535 --> 41:48.115
Okay, time to open presents.

41:53.175 --> 41:55.585
This one is from Sarah and I.

42:05.805 --> 42:07.803
Is this a dildo?

42:07.805 --> 42:10.203
Yeah, every girl's best friend.

42:10.205 --> 42:11.443
Even you?

42:11.445 --> 42:12.605
Especially me.

42:13.835 --> 42:16.763
Whoa I've never had one of these.

42:16.765 --> 42:19.033
It works the same way
as the regular kind.

42:19.035 --> 42:21.863
Just no emotions or sweat.

42:21.865 --> 42:26.503
And tears, oh my god, that reminds me,

42:26.505 --> 42:29.863
Roger came to work on Monday
and he was bitching at me

42:29.865 --> 42:31.655
about how I humiliated him.

42:33.395 --> 42:36.723
I had to call security and
then he never came back.

42:36.725 --> 42:38.135
So you got him fired?

42:39.465 --> 42:41.415
I'm pretty sure he got himself fired.

42:43.665 --> 42:46.173
Wow, thanks you guys, thanks.

42:46.175 --> 42:47.923
This will come in really handy, you know,

42:47.925 --> 42:49.605
while Peter's knees heal.

42:51.325 --> 42:52.525
That one's mine.

42:55.485 --> 42:56.355
Thanks Kim.

43:04.015 --> 43:04.932
Oh, thanks.

43:07.635 --> 43:08.468
So much.

43:16.055 --> 43:16.957
What is this?

43:18.435 --> 43:20.343
It's a gag ball.

43:20.345 --> 43:21.905
What do I use it for?

43:23.095 --> 43:26.173
That's to keep yourself
and your man quiet

43:26.175 --> 43:28.543
in case you wanna get a little rough.

43:28.545 --> 43:31.323
Hmm, thanks.

43:31.325 --> 43:33.263
Kind of scared to open the next gift.

43:33.265 --> 43:35.075
No it's okay, just open it.

43:43.885 --> 43:45.193
What's this for?

43:45.195 --> 43:48.303
Oh it's just a silly
little bachelorette tiara.

43:48.305 --> 43:51.135
- Aw, thanks.
- There's more.

43:57.655 --> 44:01.953
Wow, it's really,
really pretty, I love it.

44:01.955 --> 44:05.673
Good, I had to kind of guess your size,

44:05.675 --> 44:06.923
so I hope it fits.

44:06.925 --> 44:11.185
Aw, thank you, thank
you guys all so much.

44:12.845 --> 44:14.983
Do you not like your food?

44:14.985 --> 44:16.963
You haven't touched anything.

44:16.965 --> 44:19.073
No, I'm not super hungry right now.

44:19.075 --> 44:24.075
Oh, how about we put on our PJs?

44:24.375 --> 44:26.435
I'm gonna go try on my new nightgown.

44:31.145 --> 44:32.825
Someone can change in there.

44:37.346 --> 44:39.429
Well this isn't so bad.

46:27.395 --> 46:28.228
Thanks.

46:29.785 --> 46:31.985
I just want you to
know how grateful I am.

46:33.875 --> 46:37.863
I just really wanted to be
here for your special day.

46:37.865 --> 46:41.235
It's gonna be the most
special day ever, you'll see.

46:44.272 --> 46:45.105
Cheers.

47:05.985 --> 47:06.935
You feeling okay?

47:10.915 --> 47:12.515
This weekend is so fucked up.

47:14.945 --> 47:15.778
Yep.

47:22.345 --> 47:23.845
She seems like she's trying.

47:25.855 --> 47:28.105
I know, it's creeping me the fuck out.

47:29.845 --> 47:32.585
It's unnatural behavior for her.

47:37.475 --> 47:41.833
Maybe me losing it on her
had some kind of effect.

47:41.835 --> 47:44.125
I am so sad I missed that.

47:48.190 --> 47:49.625
It wasn't pretty.

47:52.965 --> 47:53.915
I'm proud of you.

47:56.995 --> 47:57.885
Thanks.

49:43.815 --> 49:44.917
Hey ladies.

49:50.135 --> 49:52.098
Oh hush, calm down.

49:52.100 --> 49:53.515
You'll only hurt yourselves.

49:58.985 --> 50:02.533
Oh Kim.

50:02.535 --> 50:05.165
Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim!

50:06.635 --> 50:09.165
Sucks to have no control, doesn't it?

50:12.925 --> 50:16.205
Well no need to worry,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

50:23.055 --> 50:27.195
I just wanna have a
little fun, that's all.

50:29.275 --> 50:34.275
I thought we could play this
Hens Night game of yours.

50:34.345 --> 50:36.485
New jar, new tasks.

50:41.385 --> 50:43.585
There's a special one
for you in there, Kim.

50:46.409 --> 50:50.625
You know, not only did you
completely humiliate me,

50:52.705 --> 50:55.095
you treated me as if I was disposable.

50:56.665 --> 50:58.312
Yes, you did.

50:58.314 --> 51:03.314
And the rest of you, you
just laughed at my expense.

51:05.925 --> 51:09.413
Oh, oh, and then I got fired when I tried

51:09.415 --> 51:10.985
to approach you about it!

51:13.535 --> 51:15.785
You basically ruined my life.

51:17.315 --> 51:19.863
You turned me into the
punchline of every fucking joke

51:19.865 --> 51:21.365
that comes out of your mouths.

51:25.514 --> 51:27.385
Do you know why I cried that night?

51:30.855 --> 51:31.745
Kim knows.

51:33.885 --> 51:36.123
I cried because I was a married man

51:36.125 --> 51:38.313
and I knew the second I had sex with Kim,

51:38.315 --> 51:40.075
I had lost my wife forever.

51:41.865 --> 51:43.495
It wasn't even worth it!

51:44.847 --> 51:46.680
You were not worth it!

51:51.745 --> 51:54.265
Yeah, she left those
details out, didn't she?

52:03.025 --> 52:03.858
Pay back!

52:06.185 --> 52:09.273
I want to humiliate you for
every joke at my expense,

52:09.275 --> 52:11.943
every eye roll in my direction.

52:11.945 --> 52:14.513
I hope that after tonight,
you guys can never look

52:14.515 --> 52:16.305
at each other the same way again.

52:17.525 --> 52:20.925
But hey, at least none of
you have to sleep with Kim.

52:24.905 --> 52:26.325
You're first, bachelorette.

52:28.665 --> 52:29.795
Relax.

52:31.125 --> 52:32.175
I'm gonna untie you.

52:34.198 --> 52:38.468
Don't do anything stupid
and everything will be fine,

52:38.470 --> 52:39.470
you hear me?

52:52.634 --> 52:54.217
What are you doing?

52:59.813 --> 53:00.980
What the fuck?

53:03.075 --> 53:04.711
What the fuck?

53:04.713 --> 53:05.630
Be quiet!

53:30.679 --> 53:31.679
Thank god.

53:45.685 --> 53:46.518
Are you okay?

53:49.675 --> 53:50.508
Laura?

53:53.355 --> 53:54.188
Holy shit.

53:55.895 --> 53:57.835
It's okay, Laura, you had to.

53:59.305 --> 54:02.585
I knew I had to do that, but holy shit!

54:03.506 --> 54:04.339
What a rush.

54:05.615 --> 54:07.643
Listen, I know Roger is a psycho, but...

54:07.645 --> 54:09.765
Shut your fucking mouth, whore!

54:11.272 --> 54:14.203
What the fuck is your problem, untie us.

54:14.205 --> 54:16.593
Sorry, can't.

54:16.595 --> 54:19.815
Laura, it's not funny, untie us.

54:21.741 --> 54:24.793
Okay, so you are never gonna believe...

54:24.795 --> 54:27.935
Okay stop talking and
fucking untie us now!

54:28.812 --> 54:30.145
What the fuck!

54:31.942 --> 54:34.025
She's fine, she's fine.

54:35.816 --> 54:37.143
She's just fine.

54:37.145 --> 54:39.433
Psycho bitch.

54:39.435 --> 54:41.633
Are you guys dumb?

54:41.635 --> 54:44.945
Can you just shut your
frigging traps and cooperate?

54:45.918 --> 54:48.748
And you won't get hurt like Roger.

54:48.750 --> 54:49.750
Right Roger?

54:54.035 --> 54:56.313
He was here to help me drug you guys

54:56.315 --> 54:58.005
and you know do the heavy lifting

54:58.007 --> 55:01.555
and boy some of you were really heavy.

55:05.246 --> 55:06.896
Funny you didn't know about this.

55:10.175 --> 55:11.225
Are you kidding me?

55:12.405 --> 55:14.075
You're fucking insane.

55:15.782 --> 55:20.395
If you're not quiet, I'm
gonna cut your foot off!

55:23.335 --> 55:25.955
I need you later, but not all of you.

55:27.865 --> 55:29.365
What are you gonna do to us?

55:30.615 --> 55:33.113
I'm glad you asked, Holly.

55:33.115 --> 55:34.633
We're gonna play this little game again

55:34.635 --> 55:38.255
but this time it'll be fun,
and this time, you lose.

55:41.895 --> 55:44.623
Why do you fucking hate me so much?

55:44.625 --> 55:49.023
Because you're an entitled little bitch.

55:49.025 --> 55:52.862
You do what you want,
and say what you want,

55:52.864 --> 55:56.405
and you have everything I should have.

55:57.825 --> 56:00.625
What's your fiance gonna say about this?

56:02.703 --> 56:05.870
Don't you ever talk about my fiance.

56:13.735 --> 56:16.003
I can't believe you
ate a piece of my cake,

56:16.005 --> 56:17.505
you stupid shit!

56:22.845 --> 56:24.175
Time to play.

56:26.177 --> 56:30.025
How about we go in order,
who I like most to least.

56:31.955 --> 56:33.485
You're up first Holly.

56:36.304 --> 56:39.085
Oh I like this one.

56:42.650 --> 56:45.483
Oh, listen, it's not that bad, no.

56:47.078 --> 56:49.943
I came up with the task myself.

56:49.945 --> 56:52.933
Don't do this,
I'll do all their tasks.

56:52.935 --> 56:54.865
Of course you will.

56:55.775 --> 56:58.415
Always trying to make it about you again.

57:01.875 --> 57:03.553
You're up, Holly.

57:03.555 --> 57:07.693
So if I do it, you
say you won't hurt us?

57:07.695 --> 57:10.093
You have my word.

57:10.095 --> 57:12.865
I'll even untie you if you do it right.

57:18.205 --> 57:20.555
Holly, tell Jess what you think of her.

57:22.215 --> 57:25.325
Jess, what do you mean?

57:26.835 --> 57:27.668
No.

57:30.234 --> 57:34.943
Aw, sorry, you got it wrong.

57:34.945 --> 57:38.403
But because I like you,
I'll give you another shot.

57:38.405 --> 57:43.405
Come on now, Holly, tell us
what you really think of Jess.

57:48.755 --> 57:53.259
Jess, you're a whore and a fuck up

57:53.261 --> 57:57.255
and you don't deserve
anything that you have.

57:58.581 --> 57:59.414
And?

58:04.999 --> 58:07.916
And, you're not even that pretty.

58:09.618 --> 58:12.336
You're a cunt, rot in hell!

58:15.024 --> 58:17.433
Oh!

58:17.435 --> 58:19.195
Good job, I knew I liked you.

58:34.226 --> 58:35.059
No, no!

58:37.660 --> 58:38.493
No!

58:48.056 --> 58:52.256
No!

59:04.625 --> 59:06.215
I really did like her.

59:08.006 --> 59:10.935
Please let them go.

59:12.905 --> 59:17.613
Do whatever you want
to me, but let them go.

59:17.615 --> 59:18.925
It's me you hate.

59:20.561 --> 59:23.635
I don't really like Kim much either.

59:28.735 --> 59:29.945
Let them go.

59:31.483 --> 59:34.943
Tempting, no.

59:34.945 --> 59:35.935
But tempting.

59:36.969 --> 59:39.219
That would ruin everything.

59:46.035 --> 59:46.868
Next.

59:53.725 --> 59:55.455
Your task Sarah

59:58.645 --> 01:00:01.495
is to give this dildo a blowie.

01:00:03.922 --> 01:00:06.005
No, don't do it, Sarah.

01:00:29.185 --> 01:00:33.035
Now remember, less teeth, more tongue.

01:00:38.382 --> 01:00:39.215
Come on.

01:00:40.654 --> 01:00:41.487
Come on.

01:00:46.346 --> 01:00:48.346
No, stop, please stop.

01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:52.089
You can lick it.

01:00:53.709 --> 01:00:55.792
Lick it like you mean it.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:57.693
Come on.

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:00.406
Mm.

01:01:04.506 --> 01:01:06.245
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:01:10.415 --> 01:01:11.248
What's that?

01:01:13.825 --> 01:01:15.095
Time to go deeper.

01:01:20.429 --> 01:01:23.262
You are surprisingly good at this.

01:01:24.827 --> 01:01:27.577
No Laura, fuck off, let her go!

01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:32.525
What, you don't like watching
your girlfriend suck cock?

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:39.785
What do you think, Jess, you
think she can take a bit more?

01:01:42.221 --> 01:01:43.838
What do you think?

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.673
Come on.

01:01:46.068 --> 01:01:48.596
- Play.
- Leave her alone.

01:01:48.598 --> 01:01:52.104
- Come on.
- Stop, please stop!

01:01:52.106 --> 01:01:52.939
No!

01:02:07.806 --> 01:02:10.179
No, you'll fucking kill her!

01:02:10.181 --> 01:02:11.098
Let her go!

01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:42.107
Look what you made me do!

01:02:43.045 --> 01:02:44.878
You're fucking sick!

01:02:47.484 --> 01:02:49.567
You don't even know me.

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:59.423
This isn't gonna work, there's no room.

01:03:20.632 --> 01:03:21.895
If she cuts you free,

01:03:23.782 --> 01:03:26.635
you can run, get out of here.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:32.188
No, if I go, it won't be without you.

01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:33.190
Fuck, Kim.

01:03:39.739 --> 01:03:43.543
It's really too bad you
can't be helping me with this.

01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:53.643
Listen to me.

01:03:53.645 --> 01:03:55.435
No you listen to me.

01:03:56.615 --> 01:03:58.183
I'm not going without you.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.160
My turn!

01:04:15.325 --> 01:04:19.949
Introduce your fiance to the girls.

01:04:19.951 --> 01:04:21.655
Fun, I'm gonna go get him.

01:04:25.497 --> 01:04:26.865
What the fuck?

01:04:40.205 --> 01:04:43.455
You'll have to excuse him, ladies.

01:04:45.054 --> 01:04:47.093
Drugs are wearing off a little bit

01:04:47.095 --> 01:04:48.553
and you know he might be hungry,

01:04:48.555 --> 01:04:50.745
he's been here for about a week.

01:04:52.515 --> 01:04:53.348
Anyway!

01:04:54.818 --> 01:04:55.651
No, no!

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:58.365
Please leave him alone.

01:04:59.887 --> 01:05:01.488
What did you do?

01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:02.823
What did you do?

01:07:10.175 --> 01:07:11.125
Tom,

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:13.805
Tom?

01:07:17.165 --> 01:07:20.525
Tom, you know Jess and Kim.

01:07:23.435 --> 01:07:24.765
Oh and that's Roger.

01:07:26.366 --> 01:07:30.533
Please, I'm begging you,
don't hurt him anymore.

01:07:31.475 --> 01:07:33.075
I didn't hurt him.

01:07:37.328 --> 01:07:40.193
Oh, his knees.

01:07:40.195 --> 01:07:41.873
Well Jess what did you want me to do,

01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:43.425
he wouldn't cooperate.

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:48.695
How can you make love to a
man that doesn't cooperate?

01:07:49.684 --> 01:07:52.765
But he gave in eventually.

01:07:55.279 --> 01:07:56.995
Please leave him alone!

01:07:58.415 --> 01:07:59.465
But it was the best

01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:02.975
blowjob he's ever had.

01:08:09.715 --> 01:08:11.585
Oh that's fucked up.

01:08:14.485 --> 01:08:15.318
No.

01:08:16.408 --> 01:08:17.408
That's love.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.212
And let's keep playing.

01:08:22.215 --> 01:08:24.404
Why don't you just kill us already?

01:08:25.828 --> 01:08:28.995
I can't do that,
silly, I need witnesses.

01:08:35.299 --> 01:08:37.716
It's my wedding day tomorrow.

01:08:44.645 --> 01:08:46.313
He ordains weddings.

01:08:49.715 --> 01:08:51.185
You're invited by the way.

01:08:52.455 --> 01:08:53.287
Wait.

01:08:55.035 --> 01:08:59.545
You want me to marry you to him?

01:09:19.331 --> 01:09:20.983
What's funny?

01:09:20.984 --> 01:09:23.863
You're a grade A psycho,
I mean you're like truly

01:09:23.865 --> 01:09:27.901
fucked in the head and there's
no way I'm gonna marry you.

01:09:27.903 --> 01:09:28.755
No way in hell.

01:09:29.769 --> 01:09:30.602
What?

01:09:32.165 --> 01:09:33.345
Go fuck yourself.

01:09:43.524 --> 01:09:47.785
Now when the time comes,
you're going to marry us!

01:09:53.515 --> 01:09:56.505
Super, now it's Jess' turn to play.

01:10:03.725 --> 01:10:08.043
Now Jessica, this one's a
little more like therapy.

01:10:08.045 --> 01:10:12.325
Yep so I heard that you
don't like food much, mm-hm.

01:10:13.385 --> 01:10:14.853
My suggestion would be, you know,

01:10:14.855 --> 01:10:19.605
maybe you should starve
yourself instead of throwing up.

01:10:21.505 --> 01:10:23.883
You might be less fat.

01:10:23.885 --> 01:10:25.065
Fucking bitch.

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:27.405
You knew about this?

01:10:28.265 --> 01:10:29.365
Some friend you are.

01:10:31.245 --> 01:10:33.775
But you know what, I'm
family, I'm here to help.

01:10:38.855 --> 01:10:39.855
Eat the whole thing.

01:10:40.938 --> 01:10:42.355
It's gluten free.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.160
That a girl!

01:11:00.025 --> 01:11:02.425
It has to go down and it has to stay down.

01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:10.682
It's okay, Jess.

01:11:25.693 --> 01:11:27.919
It's pretty gross, right.

01:11:27.921 --> 01:11:29.861
She looks like some kind of pig.

01:11:29.863 --> 01:11:32.696
You know what, I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:11:35.105 --> 01:11:37.717
At least I'm able to
eat without getting it

01:11:37.719 --> 01:11:39.136
all over my face.

01:11:40.621 --> 01:11:42.454
Except for last night.

01:11:55.223 --> 01:11:56.140
Kim's turn.

01:12:02.025 --> 01:12:03.753
Kimmy.

01:12:03.755 --> 01:12:07.045
Your task is to punch your
best friend in the face.

01:12:07.965 --> 01:12:09.815
What a coincidence, she's right here.

01:12:27.315 --> 01:12:29.335
Now Kimmy, I'm gonna untie you.

01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:32.875
You know what happened to the others.

01:12:36.635 --> 01:12:37.485
Go ahead.

01:12:42.075 --> 01:12:43.585
Tic toc, tic toc.

01:12:45.155 --> 01:12:48.245
Lord please give me a reason
to kill you right now.

01:12:58.212 --> 01:12:59.629
That was amazing.

01:13:10.333 --> 01:13:11.166
Kim!

01:13:20.553 --> 01:13:21.386
Hit her!

01:14:17.278 --> 01:14:18.111
Kim!

01:14:22.095 --> 01:14:23.595
- Kim!
- Jess, Jess!

01:14:24.992 --> 01:14:26.075
By your feet.

01:15:41.482 --> 01:15:43.221
Unicorn motherfucker.

01:15:46.392 --> 01:15:47.225
Kim!

01:15:48.341 --> 01:15:49.174
Kim!

01:15:50.848 --> 01:15:51.681
Kim!

01:16:05.452 --> 01:16:06.283
Kim?

01:16:06.285 --> 01:16:09.618
Sorry.

01:16:12.794 --> 01:16:13.844
Kimmy didn't make it.

01:16:16.941 --> 01:16:18.745
Unicorn motherfucker.

01:17:02.445 --> 01:17:05.033
Roger, is it still gonna work

01:17:05.035 --> 01:17:06.495
if there's only one witness?

01:17:07.945 --> 01:17:11.407
Yeah okay, I don't fucking care.

01:17:11.409 --> 01:17:13.265
Oh thank god.

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:17.865
Now what was I doing?

01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:18.700
Oh right.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.963
Tom,

01:17:25.965 --> 01:17:26.798
Tom.

01:17:27.657 --> 01:17:28.490
Tom.

01:17:30.225 --> 01:17:31.058
I'm sorry,

01:17:32.265 --> 01:17:34.055
I'm sorry I did this to your knee.

01:17:36.755 --> 01:17:37.655
But I had to.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:44.145
You have to know how much I love you.

01:17:45.303 --> 01:17:46.935
You have to know that.

01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:50.053
Jess never loved you.

01:17:50.055 --> 01:17:53.383
She's not, she's not right for you.

01:17:53.385 --> 01:17:55.125
I'm right for you.

01:17:57.265 --> 01:17:58.835
Don't you know that?

01:18:01.365 --> 01:18:04.415
She loved Kim more than she loved you.

01:18:07.377 --> 01:18:08.210
You know?

01:18:09.487 --> 01:18:10.979
But I love you.

01:18:10.981 --> 01:18:13.935
I choose you and only you.

01:18:15.235 --> 01:18:16.363
So what do you say?

01:18:16.365 --> 01:18:21.005
Me and you together, as husband and wife?

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:37.874
Really, you choose me over Jess?

01:18:43.105 --> 01:18:43.983
Yes.

01:18:56.179 --> 01:18:58.533
You're so beautiful.

01:18:58.535 --> 01:18:59.993
Ever since I first saw you,

01:18:59.995 --> 01:19:02.593
I knew that Jess and I were done.

01:19:02.595 --> 01:19:05.125
Now there's no going back.

01:19:36.557 --> 01:19:37.807
Fuck!

01:20:15.825 --> 01:20:17.265
I wanted to love you.

01:20:20.325 --> 01:20:22.475
I wanted you to love me too.

01:20:24.395 --> 01:20:25.439
But for real.

01:20:30.724 --> 01:20:32.425
I'm cold.

01:20:44.693 --> 01:20:46.193
Your life is shit.

01:20:56.314 --> 01:20:57.231
No friends.

01:20:59.036 --> 01:21:00.685
No Tom.

01:21:09.562 --> 01:21:10.395
You're me.

01:21:13.981 --> 01:21:14.814
You're me.
