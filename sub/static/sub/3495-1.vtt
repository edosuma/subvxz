00:23.562 --> 00:25.430
Fuck!

02:14.340 --> 02:16.574
Hey there, good looking.

02:16.576 --> 02:18.376
Deputy Brody.

02:18.378 --> 02:20.612
I hope you're here to frisk me.

02:24.683 --> 02:27.619
Well, service is half our motto.

02:30.289 --> 02:33.324
Don't they prohibit you
from corrupting young girls?

02:33.326 --> 02:36.394
I'm pretty sure you've
already been corrupted.

02:56.682 --> 02:58.416
Hell of a thing.

02:58.418 --> 03:00.585
Billion dollars
to put it up in the sky,

03:00.587 --> 03:03.788
60 million to bring it back.

03:03.790 --> 03:05.690
<i>Are we still confirmed
for launch time?</i>

03:05.692 --> 03:09.194
No sir, it's been
pushed back to 0-800.

03:09.196 --> 03:11.563
Well, you can tell them
that Recovery is still ready

03:11.565 --> 03:13.932
and waiting for the sky to fall.
<i>Yes sir.</i>

03:13.934 --> 03:16.834
I'll be in rover two
if you need me.

04:12.958 --> 04:15.260
Sir, control is ready to launch.

04:15.262 --> 04:21.666
About time. Inform control that
rover is ready and waiting.

04:21.668 --> 04:24.869
Control indicates
firing in ten, nine...

04:24.871 --> 04:27.572
I'll just read it off the
screen, Sarge. Eight...

04:27.574 --> 04:29.641
I'll just read it
off the screen.

04:39.619 --> 04:41.919
Sir, we have a
deviation... Say again?

04:41.921 --> 04:43.721
The satellite
is off-plane.

04:43.723 --> 04:46.824
Control is aborting the launch.

04:49.395 --> 04:51.996
Screens are not
showing anything.

04:51.998 --> 04:55.900
All right, back it up and show me
the past few seconds of footage.

05:00.739 --> 05:04.842
Doesn't appear
to be military, sir.

05:04.844 --> 05:06.511
Could be a meteor.

05:10.949 --> 05:13.518
Plot the target's new
trajectory and point of impact.

05:40.713 --> 05:42.947
I've been thinking
a lot about what you said.

05:52.124 --> 05:54.625
I just don't get it.

05:54.627 --> 05:59.030
You love me.
I love you...

06:00.065 --> 06:02.700
I like you a lot, Max.

06:02.702 --> 06:05.403
Just...

06:05.405 --> 06:06.471
love?

06:06.473 --> 06:08.072
I'm not even sure what that is.

06:08.074 --> 06:09.607
Brooke.

06:09.609 --> 06:13.578
We agreed on just friends.

06:13.580 --> 06:16.414
If you can't handle that,

06:16.416 --> 06:20.651
then this is just
gonna have to stop.

06:20.653 --> 06:21.853
I'm just trying to...

06:21.855 --> 06:24.389
Yeah, I know you're
trying, all right?

06:24.391 --> 06:25.623
But...

06:27.626 --> 06:28.826
I also know how I feel.

06:28.828 --> 06:30.962
And until I feel differently,

06:30.964 --> 06:34.565
this is just how it has to be.

06:37.035 --> 06:38.136
Okay?

06:39.405 --> 06:40.138
So...

06:42.641 --> 06:44.008
How's it gonna be?

06:49.548 --> 06:51.149
Well, I'm not giving you up.

06:55.687 --> 06:59.157
So I guess I'll stick
with this then.

06:59.159 --> 07:01.659
I just... I just don't
want to keep having

07:01.661 --> 07:03.060
the same conversation.

07:03.062 --> 07:05.563
Yeah, I... I get it,
all right?

07:06.565 --> 07:07.965
And mum's the word.

07:09.936 --> 07:11.169
Man.

07:12.805 --> 07:14.906
You're a hard woman to love.

07:21.113 --> 07:22.480
I know.

07:24.616 --> 07:27.218
See you later then?

07:27.220 --> 07:28.820
It is a small town.

07:28.822 --> 07:29.687
Ouch.

07:37.062 --> 07:38.162
Be careful.

07:38.164 --> 07:38.965
Watch out for bears.

07:42.201 --> 07:43.734
And lions and tigers.

08:31.650 --> 08:33.518
Supposed to be good weather.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.587
That's good news.

08:36.589 --> 08:39.023
Steph's been working
so hard on that merit badge.

08:39.025 --> 08:41.659
I'd hate for her
to come home empty handed.

08:41.660 --> 08:44.028
Ah, she'll do fine
rain or shine.

08:44.963 --> 08:46.163
Brooke still out on her run?

08:46.165 --> 08:47.899
She left before sunrise.

08:47.901 --> 08:49.000
You know that girl
is gonna get hurt

08:49.002 --> 08:50.868
if she keeps running at night.

08:50.870 --> 08:52.737
She's been running
in those woods forever.

08:52.739 --> 08:54.672
She knows where
all those mines are,

08:54.674 --> 08:56.607
yours included.

09:00.112 --> 09:03.214
<i>About time you got up.</i>

09:03.216 --> 09:04.949
Daylight's a wastin'.

09:04.951 --> 09:07.652
I'd have been up sooner if you
had a phone in this place.

09:07.654 --> 09:09.654
That's your answer
for everything.

09:09.656 --> 09:12.023
Get a phone and you'll
stop hearing it.

09:13.959 --> 09:15.226
Where you heading today?

09:15.228 --> 09:17.595
Thought I'd head
up to the gorge.

09:17.597 --> 09:19.630
Some good deadfall up there.

09:19.632 --> 09:23.568
Plus, the burnout will be
good for the seedlings.

09:23.570 --> 09:25.570
Well, if it stays clear
we'll use the mares

09:25.572 --> 09:29.073
and bring it all on home.

09:29.075 --> 09:31.042
Sounds good to me.

09:31.044 --> 09:32.176
See y'all later.

09:43.288 --> 09:45.590
There go the fuel tanks.

09:48.060 --> 09:49.226
Get the team wheels up.

09:49.228 --> 09:52.930
I want best speed
for Preacher's Mill.

09:52.932 --> 09:54.832
Inform HOUSTONET
we'll survey the wreckage

09:54.834 --> 09:57.234
and extract whatever's left.

09:57.236 --> 09:58.603
And tell the local fire crews

09:58.605 --> 10:00.004
to hang back
until we get there.

10:00.006 --> 10:01.973
The last thing we need
is for some short order cook

10:01.975 --> 10:03.741
to get a face full
of hydrazine.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.280
Hey, Dad.

10:10.248 --> 10:11.749
Hey, good morning, Brooke.

10:11.751 --> 10:13.217
How was your run?
Good.

10:13.219 --> 10:14.385
<i>You about ready to go?</i>

10:14.387 --> 10:16.754
Steph is going crazy
with the wait.

10:16.756 --> 10:18.623
Yeah, I'll be just a sec.

10:29.735 --> 10:31.102
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

10:31.104 --> 10:32.703
Hi, sweetheart,
how was the run?

10:32.705 --> 10:33.904
<i>Good.</i>

10:33.906 --> 10:35.740
Your Dad and Steph
are waiting on you.

10:35.742 --> 10:38.776
Yeah, I know.
Dad already told me.

10:38.778 --> 10:41.345
You almost ready?

10:42.415 --> 10:46.283
<i>You ready to kicksome Forestal butt?</i>

10:46.285 --> 10:48.319
It's just a camp-out.

10:49.421 --> 10:52.657
Yeah, well, hope
you're rested up.

10:52.659 --> 10:54.792
<i>Mrs. Brewer tells methat your campsite</i>

10:54.794 --> 10:58.829
<i>is almost two milesfrom the parking lot.</i>

11:00.232 --> 11:05.803
Two miles through
the spooky woods.

11:32.330 --> 11:34.865
<i>♪ Ah, went the littlegreen frog one day ♪</i>

11:34.867 --> 11:37.435
<i>♪ and it all went mmm ah mmm ♪</i>

11:38.837 --> 11:40.004
Oh, yeah.

11:40.006 --> 11:42.406

11:42.408 --> 11:44.442

11:51.483 --> 11:53.818
Did you hear that?

11:53.820 --> 11:54.785
What?

11:56.888 --> 11:58.289
Something.

11:59.324 --> 12:00.891
No.

12:09.468 --> 12:11.168
Morning, Green!

12:13.905 --> 12:15.473
Green!

12:18.176 --> 12:19.276
Morning, Stu.

12:22.114 --> 12:23.748
How can we help you today?

12:23.750 --> 12:26.951
Ah, little bit of weighing,
little bit of trade?

12:54.980 --> 12:56.247
You know cell service is down?

12:56.249 --> 12:57.982
Probably something you did.

12:59.284 --> 13:00.985
Why'd we give you
that badge again?

13:00.987 --> 13:03.254
Won it off the Sheriff
in a poker game.

13:18.570 --> 13:20.404
Did you hear something earlier?

13:20.406 --> 13:22.206
I heard this big boom.
It sounded like...

13:22.208 --> 13:25.009
The sound of a satellite hitting
the side of South Mountain?

13:25.977 --> 13:27.178
You're shitting me.

13:28.581 --> 13:31.549
The army says that
there is or will be

13:31.551 --> 13:33.851
a hell of a fire,
and that we should

13:33.853 --> 13:35.586
steer clear, although
what they actually say

13:35.588 --> 13:36.987
is we should steer cle...

13:36.989 --> 13:41.158
Probably means that the
communications equipment's

13:41.160 --> 13:43.260
nice and toasty
right about now,

13:43.262 --> 13:45.396
hence the lack
of cell phone service.

13:47.499 --> 13:49.934
Wonderful.

13:49.936 --> 13:52.469
According to this,
the satellite still

13:52.471 --> 13:55.573
has over half its fuel left.
Hydrazine.

13:57.342 --> 13:59.443
Hand me that book
over there, would you?

14:02.214 --> 14:04.548
Thanks.

14:04.550 --> 14:07.318
You really think Miller can
handle this kind of hazmat shit?

14:07.320 --> 14:08.619
I don't know about handling it,

14:08.621 --> 14:10.421
but they definitely
need to get up there

14:10.423 --> 14:11.956
and check out that fire.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.224
They got all sorts of equipment

14:13.226 --> 14:14.892
and they don't use half of it.

14:14.894 --> 14:16.093
That reminds me.
I gotta take

14:16.095 --> 14:17.862
the Chief's car
to get an oil change.

14:17.864 --> 14:19.330
Flip you for the duty.

14:21.267 --> 14:23.334
Sorry, Davidson,
only full-time deputies

14:23.336 --> 14:25.369
get to play games of chance.

14:26.872 --> 14:28.172
Enjoy your drive, though.

14:30.141 --> 14:31.408
While you're at it, stop out

14:31.410 --> 14:33.477
at Silver Springs,
too, and warn them off.

14:33.479 --> 14:37.548
Yeah, I'll tell the hippies not
to inhale any of the smoke.

14:37.550 --> 14:39.083
Just tell them
to come down here

14:39.085 --> 14:41.051
if the fire heads their way.

14:41.053 --> 14:43.954
I'm gonna go ahead and take my
lunch break out at Silver Creek.

14:43.956 --> 14:45.522
Hey, there's
no lunch, Davidson!

14:45.524 --> 14:47.191
We've got a fire on our hands!

14:49.362 --> 14:50.527
We're policemen, Max.

14:50.529 --> 14:53.197
We handle crimes.
Firemen handle fires.

14:57.270 --> 15:00.971
Fine. Be back here in an hour
and a half or so regardless.

15:00.973 --> 15:03.374
You have my word as a physician
and part-time deputy.

15:03.376 --> 15:05.509
Hey! Watch those
bootlegger turns.

15:05.511 --> 15:09.246
Chief says you keep it up those tires
will be coming out of your pay.

15:09.248 --> 15:10.581
What is the point
of being a lawman

15:10.583 --> 15:12.082
if you can't break the law?

15:18.990 --> 15:20.291
Chrissy, I mean, seriously,

15:20.293 --> 15:22.059
your mom and dad
haven't even been gone

15:22.061 --> 15:23.560
for five minutes
and you're already...

15:23.562 --> 15:25.229
Hey!
You got everything?

15:25.231 --> 15:26.630
Yep.

15:26.632 --> 15:28.599
Okay then, you two crazy girls

15:28.601 --> 15:33.337
<i>- I will!</i>
<i>- We will!</i>

15:34.406 --> 15:36.106
I'll bring her back on Sunday.

15:37.676 --> 15:39.576
That'd be great,
but no need to rush.

15:39.578 --> 15:41.412
I'm going over to Chad's
for the weekend.

15:41.414 --> 15:43.547
Gotcha.
Sunday afternoon it is.

16:01.267 --> 16:04.168
Chrissy, are you sure you
should be eating that much?

16:04.170 --> 16:06.537
Aren't you supposed to go
hiking as part of this trip?

16:06.539 --> 16:08.272
But I'm hungry and my mom said

16:08.274 --> 16:10.374
I could have some
while she's gone.

16:10.376 --> 16:13.410
She said you could
have the whole box?

16:13.412 --> 16:16.213
Steph, sweetie, I don't want
you eating a bunch, okay?

16:16.215 --> 16:17.982
I won't.

16:24.656 --> 16:26.290
<i>Gross!</i>

16:26.292 --> 16:28.425
<i>Great.</i>

16:37.569 --> 16:38.702
All right.

16:41.139 --> 16:43.207
You all set?
Yup.

16:43.209 --> 16:45.576
Okay. There's no reason
to be scared, sweetie, okay?

16:45.578 --> 16:47.044
You've got
your whole troupe here.

16:47.046 --> 16:48.746
I'm not scared. It's
going to be fun.

16:48.748 --> 16:52.116
Great. I'll meet you right
back here on Sunday, okay?

16:52.118 --> 16:54.752
And we'll go for some ice cream.
Ugh.

16:54.754 --> 16:58.522
Okay.
Maybe not ice cream.

16:58.524 --> 16:59.323
Bye.

17:03.261 --> 17:05.496
Stephanie!
Hi, Stephanie! Hi!

17:05.498 --> 17:07.765
Hey, you can't get me!

17:07.767 --> 17:10.601
<i>You just got me!</i>

17:13.238 --> 17:16.205
All right,
Chrissy, homeward bound.

17:28.420 --> 17:29.653
Tell you what, Cap.

17:29.655 --> 17:31.722
If this is another false alarm,

17:31.724 --> 17:34.792
I'm gonna hit somebody
with my fucking Halligan.

17:34.794 --> 17:36.827
Fantastic.
We've got a job to do.

17:39.197 --> 17:41.098
Holy shit.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.132
Wow.

17:46.505 --> 17:48.639
Are we gonna call the
park service for this?

17:48.641 --> 17:49.740
Power's out.

17:52.177 --> 17:53.410
What the hell is this?

18:00.618 --> 18:02.786
It's all fucking shitty.

18:08.493 --> 18:09.326
Oh, yeah.

18:26.644 --> 18:27.578
Okay?

18:34.652 --> 18:35.853
Hey!

18:37.256 --> 18:41.291
<i>So, d'ya hear about the fire?</i>

18:41.293 --> 18:42.192
No.

18:44.262 --> 18:45.562
Chrissy?

18:47.198 --> 18:50.734
She ate a bunch
of sweets and threw up.

18:50.736 --> 18:53.203
We weren't in the camping
mood after that.

18:53.205 --> 18:55.839
<i>I told you not
to eat all that stuff.</i>

18:57.742 --> 19:01.678
Do you mind if I
drop her here with you?

19:03.348 --> 19:05.182
No, that's okay. Fine. Fine.

19:05.184 --> 19:06.250
Come on, piglet.

19:06.252 --> 19:07.885
Let's get you a place to sit.

19:13.491 --> 19:15.659
What was that about the fire?

19:15.661 --> 19:19.163
Ah, up on South Mountain.
Some wildfire or something.

19:19.165 --> 19:23.233
Best ask your boyfriend.
I just play here.

19:23.235 --> 19:26.203
Yo, where's that ball?
Okay. Bye-bye.

19:26.205 --> 19:27.371
Ball, please.

19:29.574 --> 19:31.308
<i>Deputy?</i>

19:33.478 --> 19:34.478
Ma'am?

19:37.182 --> 19:39.283
So, do you have any
plans for dinner?

19:39.285 --> 19:40.951
Well, I'm supposed
to have dinner

19:40.953 --> 19:42.553
with this guy I know.

19:42.555 --> 19:43.520
Oh.

19:45.256 --> 19:46.523
He's in law enforcement.

19:47.859 --> 19:49.426
Well, if it's
the chief, I think

19:49.428 --> 19:50.761
I've got some
ass-kicking to do.

19:53.765 --> 19:54.932
And if it is, I think you have

19:54.934 --> 19:56.867
a daddy complex, little girl.

19:57.835 --> 19:59.469
Oh?

20:01.206 --> 20:03.373
What's up with the fire?

20:03.375 --> 20:05.442
Steph's out camping, you know?

20:05.444 --> 20:07.311
Yeah, they're,
all the Forestals,

20:07.313 --> 20:09.446
they're out at Silver Lake,
you know that.

20:09.448 --> 20:12.916
The fire's nowhere near there.

20:12.918 --> 20:14.785
So, I got Miller and his team

20:14.787 --> 20:16.486
checking it out right now.

20:16.488 --> 20:17.721
They're digging some firebreaks

20:17.723 --> 20:20.290
and other than that
we're just supposed

20:20.292 --> 20:23.460
to wait until the feds show up.

20:23.462 --> 20:24.661
The feds?

20:24.663 --> 20:28.398
Oh, yeah, the fire
was actually started

20:28.400 --> 20:30.701
by this satellite
that they were trying

20:30.703 --> 20:32.236
to shoot down or something

20:32.238 --> 20:33.837
and it fell out of orbit

20:33.839 --> 20:37.241
and crash landed in beautiful,
scenic Preacher's Mill.

20:37.243 --> 20:40.611
What are the odds, right?
Yeah, really.

20:40.613 --> 20:41.912
So, they're
supposed to send out

20:41.914 --> 20:43.413
some HAZMAT team or something

20:43.415 --> 20:44.982
and until then
we're just supposed

20:44.984 --> 20:47.517
to steer clear.

20:47.519 --> 20:48.385
Wow.

20:48.387 --> 20:49.686
Yeah, wow.

20:49.688 --> 20:51.021
First the iron ore runs out

20:51.023 --> 20:53.624
and now shit's
falling from the sky.

20:54.759 --> 20:56.627
You'll keep an eye on it, right?

20:56.629 --> 20:58.629
In case the fire shifts?

20:58.631 --> 21:03.333
Hey, your sister
and her whole coven

21:03.335 --> 21:06.003
of Forestals are gonna be fine.

21:06.005 --> 21:08.572
Long as I run this town.

21:08.574 --> 21:09.940
So they're solid until Tuesday,

21:09.942 --> 21:11.842
'cause that's when
the chief gets back.

21:13.645 --> 21:17.848
Well, I'll see you
tonight, then.

21:17.850 --> 21:18.615
Yeah.

21:41.673 --> 21:43.440
Okay, guys, listen up.

21:43.442 --> 21:44.775
The feds are gonna
be here shortly,

21:44.777 --> 21:46.710
tomorrow morning, so we
don't need any heroes.

21:46.712 --> 21:47.944
<i>Go ahead and dig your breaks</i>

21:47.946 --> 21:50.747
<i>and then back off, okay?</i>

21:50.749 --> 21:52.582
Yeah. Okay.

21:52.584 --> 21:54.551
Has anybody actually been
up to the tower yet?

21:54.553 --> 21:55.886
We just came from the tower.

21:55.888 --> 21:58.388
<i>Whole fucking thing'sburning up there.</i>

22:00.458 --> 22:03.660
I don't know how you guys
deal with this shit.

22:03.662 --> 22:05.929
Beats the hell out
of giving out enemas.

22:07.098 --> 22:09.032
Jeez, Edwards, I told
you to take a break!

22:11.103 --> 22:13.937
<i>Is he gonna be okay?</i>

22:13.939 --> 22:17.441
I don't know. Looks like
he's got heat stroke.

22:26.417 --> 22:28.885
Hey, you almost ready?

22:28.887 --> 22:29.986
I'm gonna ride back.

22:29.988 --> 22:30.987
What, all the way?

22:30.989 --> 22:32.489
That's uphill, you know.

22:32.491 --> 22:33.724
I know.

22:33.726 --> 22:35.992
The race is,
like, two weeks out.

22:35.994 --> 22:37.394
Steph all right?

22:37.396 --> 22:38.729
I think so.

22:38.731 --> 22:40.364
She's got your love
for the woods.

22:41.867 --> 22:43.033
Did you hear about that fire?

22:43.035 --> 22:45.969
Yeah, the winds are
blowing westward.

22:45.971 --> 22:47.404
Shouldn't be a problem for you

22:47.406 --> 22:48.872
if you stay on the east loop.

22:48.874 --> 22:50.807
Okay.
Will do.

22:50.809 --> 22:51.942
You home for dinner?

22:51.944 --> 22:53.610
Oh.

22:53.612 --> 22:55.645
Max is cooking.

22:55.647 --> 22:57.447
What, are you
leading that boy on?

22:57.449 --> 22:58.482
See you tomorrow.

22:58.484 --> 22:59.750
<i>Love you.</i>

23:05.724 --> 23:07.023
Need a push?

23:07.025 --> 23:09.626
Ha, ha.

23:11.062 --> 23:12.462
Shit.

23:20.773 --> 23:24.107
Ugh. Aw.
What the fuck?

23:24.109 --> 23:27.411
<i>Shh. You're gonna
wake up Chrissy.</i>

23:31.048 --> 23:34.885
Well, so much for that.

23:34.887 --> 23:36.186
How about this?

23:38.022 --> 23:39.856
Why don't you go
start the generator?

23:39.858 --> 23:41.558
Oh, what for?

23:41.560 --> 23:43.427
We've got fire.

23:43.429 --> 23:45.195
You got fire.

23:45.197 --> 23:46.930
Well, that's all true,

23:46.932 --> 23:48.965
but the house doesn't,

23:48.967 --> 23:50.767
and unless you start it,

23:50.769 --> 23:52.702
guess who's gonna be
sleeping with us?

23:52.704 --> 23:55.038
Ugh!

23:55.040 --> 23:56.773
Fine! I'll go
see if I can find

23:56.775 --> 23:59.476
a flashlight somewhere
or something.

23:59.478 --> 24:00.644
Sexy.

24:04.982 --> 24:07.083
There's one in the
kitchen closet, I think.

24:08.153 --> 24:10.187
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

24:49.560 --> 24:50.727
What is it, sweetheart?

24:50.729 --> 24:52.896
What happened?

24:52.898 --> 24:54.898
Did you have a scary dream?

24:56.801 --> 24:58.168
What happened?

24:59.904 --> 25:01.938
There's a monster outside.

25:01.940 --> 25:03.006
<i>What?</i>

25:03.008 --> 25:04.241
<i>There's a monster outside!</i>

25:04.243 --> 25:05.976
<i>He's trying to get in.</i>

25:05.978 --> 25:08.144
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

25:08.146 --> 25:10.914
All right, all right, listen up.

25:10.916 --> 25:14.684
<i>You two juststay where you are.</i>

25:14.686 --> 25:16.553
<i>Don't want him coming in here.</i>

25:17.855 --> 25:21.591
It's okay. Nothing's out there.

25:21.593 --> 25:23.560
You just had a scary
dream, that's all.

25:23.562 --> 25:25.061
Uh-uh.

25:28.266 --> 25:32.068
Hey, motherfucker,
anybody out there?

25:32.070 --> 25:35.005
Best be leaving
or I'll call the cops!

25:38.242 --> 25:40.544
It's quiet out here.

25:40.546 --> 25:41.745
Too quiet.

25:43.180 --> 25:45.715
Yo, bitches, come get some!

25:50.721 --> 25:51.922
Fucker!
Work!

25:59.697 --> 26:01.164
Chad?

26:03.834 --> 26:05.001
Chad!

26:07.738 --> 26:09.673
Chad, this isn't funny.

26:14.712 --> 26:16.079
Chad?

26:19.350 --> 26:20.917
Chad?

26:25.356 --> 26:26.690
Chad?

26:30.628 --> 26:32.128
Chad?

26:32.130 --> 26:33.330
Chad, where are you?

27:31.055 --> 27:32.422
Holy shit.

28:00.885 --> 28:03.353
<i>Davidson? In here!</i>

28:15.733 --> 28:17.067
So...

28:17.069 --> 28:19.135
how are things
going on this end?

28:19.137 --> 28:22.205
<i>I've got good newsand I've got bad news.</i>

28:22.207 --> 28:23.440
How much have you
had to drink today?

28:23.442 --> 28:25.442
That's probably the bad news.

28:25.444 --> 28:28.111
So, give me
the good news, then.

28:28.113 --> 28:29.713
<i>I've got your cause of death.</i>

28:29.715 --> 28:30.847
Mm-hmm.

28:32.950 --> 28:34.951
All right.

28:34.953 --> 28:38.188
Torso severed
in mid-thorax,

28:38.190 --> 28:41.491
eviscerated and no major
organs remaining.

28:41.493 --> 28:43.193
Massive tissue loss
across the entire

28:43.195 --> 28:46.096
musculature of the body,
maybe 70 percent.

28:46.098 --> 28:47.864
And most of the head,

28:47.866 --> 28:49.232
the right hand, the right leg,

28:49.234 --> 28:51.835
portions of the
sternum and ribs,

28:51.837 --> 28:54.370
<i>fragments of the
pelvis still intact.</i>

28:54.372 --> 28:57.841
All of it largely
denuded of tissue.

28:57.843 --> 28:59.509
Postmortem lacerations

28:59.511 --> 29:01.177
<i>and abrasions indicate all</i>

29:01.179 --> 29:03.813
the typical hallmarks
of non-frenzied feeding.

29:05.182 --> 29:07.016
So, it was a bear attack, then.

29:08.986 --> 29:10.920
This was no bear.

29:16.894 --> 29:18.128
Bite marks.

29:22.199 --> 29:24.934
Well, duh.

29:24.936 --> 29:26.936
<i>Human bite marks.</i>

29:26.938 --> 29:28.071
What?

29:29.140 --> 29:32.375
Human.
Bite marks.

29:40.017 --> 29:42.385
Struck him down and ate him up.

29:42.387 --> 29:45.188
Some...
A person did this!

29:45.190 --> 29:47.056
Yup.

29:47.058 --> 29:49.859
Oh, my God.

29:49.861 --> 29:51.528
Do you think it was Kim?

29:54.064 --> 29:55.498
Kids these days.

29:56.934 --> 30:00.403
I'm gonna go.

30:00.405 --> 30:02.405
Yeah, yeah.

30:21.058 --> 30:25.395
♪ The moose, the moose,
the moose, the moose ♪

30:25.397 --> 30:29.532
♪ Swimming in the water,
swimming in the water ♪

30:29.534 --> 30:35.104
♪ The moose, the moose,
the moose, the moose ♪

30:35.106 --> 30:38.107
<i>Hell of a fire, Sarge!</i>

30:38.109 --> 30:41.477
<i>That'll do it!</i>

30:57.261 --> 30:59.596
<i>We need to talk
about last night.</i>

31:01.398 --> 31:03.366
Sure.

31:03.368 --> 31:06.002
What was it?
A bear attack?

31:06.004 --> 31:08.238
What makes you think
it was a bear?

31:10.441 --> 31:13.476
What do you mean?
What else would it be?

31:17.548 --> 31:20.083
That's where we need your help.

31:22.019 --> 31:22.952
Sure.

31:25.289 --> 31:27.056
<i>Okay, Kim.</i>

31:27.058 --> 31:29.125
Now, this is a gelatin mold,
I just want you,

31:29.127 --> 31:31.094
it's gonna be a little warm
I want you to go ahead

31:31.096 --> 31:34.631
and put it in your mouth
and you'll bite down evenly.

31:34.633 --> 31:36.666
Wait a minute!

31:36.668 --> 31:39.002
What's going on here?

31:39.004 --> 31:42.238
It's all standard procedure
in a case like this.

31:44.575 --> 31:47.277
For a bear attack?

31:47.279 --> 31:49.646
I know it seems
a little strange, but...

31:52.616 --> 31:54.417
<i>Whoa.</i>

31:54.419 --> 31:55.551
You think...

31:55.553 --> 31:59.088
you think I ate him?

31:59.090 --> 32:00.290
Oh, my God!

32:00.292 --> 32:03.526
Now, Kim, please,
we're just trying to...

32:03.528 --> 32:06.329
What the fuck are you saying?

32:07.398 --> 32:08.631
I think I'm gonna get sick!

32:15.339 --> 32:16.306
What's that?

32:16.308 --> 32:19.142
A bucket for my vomit?

32:19.144 --> 32:21.210
<i>For my vomit, right?</i>

32:21.212 --> 32:23.079
To check my vomit.

32:23.081 --> 32:24.981
Because you think I ate him?

32:41.165 --> 32:43.266
Fine! I'll take
your test.

32:44.735 --> 32:46.502
Just get it over with!

32:48.005 --> 32:49.238
Okay, Kim.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.208
Just go ahead
and put it in your mouth,

32:52.210 --> 32:53.409
<i>bite down evenly.</i>

33:02.286 --> 33:03.319
<i>All right.</i>

33:05.389 --> 33:06.556
<i>That's it.</i>

33:08.292 --> 33:09.392
That's it?

33:11.061 --> 33:13.629
You're not gonna arrest me?

33:13.631 --> 33:15.565
Well, we do have
to hold you here

33:15.567 --> 33:17.333
until we get the results back.

33:19.236 --> 33:22.005
I want you to tell me now!

33:22.007 --> 33:23.673
You think I ate him?

33:23.675 --> 33:25.575
I want you to know now!

33:31.548 --> 33:33.349
I don't think it's a match.

33:35.552 --> 33:37.053
Jesus Christ!

33:37.055 --> 33:38.354
Kim...

33:38.356 --> 33:39.756
I'm really sorry
about all this,

33:39.758 --> 33:42.392
but we had to be...
Is there anything else?

33:42.394 --> 33:44.293
No.
Good.

33:44.295 --> 33:46.095
Then kindly fuck off!

33:55.639 --> 33:58.541
Come on, Chrissy, let's go.

33:58.543 --> 33:59.375
Come on.

34:01.211 --> 34:02.512
You know, Hardy Boys,

34:02.514 --> 34:04.147
if it wasn't a bear attack,

34:04.149 --> 34:07.250
and it wasn't me,
then what was it?

34:10.788 --> 34:12.455
Kim!

34:12.456 --> 34:13.589
God damn it.

34:14.757 --> 34:16.626
Okay.

34:16.628 --> 34:18.728
That's the other bad news.

34:20.230 --> 34:21.397
What's that?

34:21.399 --> 34:22.565
There were multiple
bite patterns

34:22.567 --> 34:23.699
on the kid's body, all right?

34:23.701 --> 34:25.168
There's more than one killer,

34:25.170 --> 34:27.136
more accurately,
more than one eater.

34:27.138 --> 34:28.538
You got to be kidding me.

34:28.540 --> 34:32.108
There's one other thing.

34:32.110 --> 34:35.678
His hypothalamus was
extremely enlarged.

34:35.679 --> 34:37.179
So?

34:37.181 --> 34:39.148
It's still growing.

34:39.150 --> 34:40.449
Almost exponentially.

34:40.452 --> 34:41.684
Even though he's dead?

34:41.686 --> 34:44.120
Even though he's dead.

34:44.121 --> 34:45.388
Look, you're the doc here,

34:45.389 --> 34:48.623
but isn't that a bit unusual?

34:48.626 --> 34:51.094
Of the body that
continue to grow

34:51.096 --> 34:52.395
after death, but
the hypothalamus

34:52.397 --> 34:54.197
is usually not one
of them, all right?

34:54.199 --> 34:55.431
So, I've done a little digging

34:55.433 --> 34:58.568
and I found something

34:58.570 --> 35:00.837
interesting going on, all right?

35:02.673 --> 35:04.440
Don't you need
permission for that?

35:22.459 --> 35:23.726
Okay, you know the drill.

35:23.728 --> 35:26.195
We move out in 20 towards
the impact crater.

35:26.197 --> 35:27.396
<i>If you see any of the locals,</i>

35:27.398 --> 35:28.531
<i>get a check on conditions,</i>

35:28.533 --> 35:30.299
<i>then check back with me.</i>

35:30.301 --> 35:32.401
<i>Get any spikes in your meters,</i>

35:32.403 --> 35:33.903
and you pull back double quick.

35:33.905 --> 35:37.507
Other than that, it's bag it and
tag it, and we can go home.

35:42.546 --> 35:44.747
Damn, it's hot out.

35:44.749 --> 35:46.582
Gonna be like hell today.

35:51.855 --> 35:54.357
<i>Ugh. You pulled
this out of Chad's head?</i>

35:56.660 --> 35:58.628
I don't know what that means.

36:01.633 --> 36:03.166
Okay.

36:03.168 --> 36:05.668
I've never seen anything
like that, all right?

36:05.670 --> 36:09.539
It's structure is,
frankly, alien.

36:11.208 --> 36:13.209
Alien, like, foreign?

36:13.211 --> 36:16.179
No, alien, like as in alien.

36:16.181 --> 36:19.916
As in not from around
here, as in Earth.

36:20.918 --> 36:22.585
What?

36:22.587 --> 36:23.786
Okay.

36:26.423 --> 36:29.292
There are hypotheses
about the possibility

36:29.294 --> 36:33.663
of germs from space
landing on a planet, okay?

36:33.665 --> 36:35.898
Galactic pan-spermia,
for example.

36:35.900 --> 36:37.567
And nobody really
pays much attention to them,

36:37.569 --> 36:38.734
they've largely
been discredited,

36:38.736 --> 36:41.837
but technically,
hypothetically,

36:41.839 --> 36:44.907
it is conceivable
that a non-terrestrial

36:44.909 --> 36:48.778
micro-organism could,
in fact, survive re-entry,

36:48.780 --> 36:51.948
land on a planet surface
where it could...

36:51.950 --> 36:53.549
Find Chad.

36:55.252 --> 36:57.553
<i>What are the odds of that?</i>

36:57.555 --> 36:59.288
About the same
as that of a satellite

36:59.290 --> 37:01.657
hitting South Mountain,
I would say.

37:01.659 --> 37:03.826
You think the satellite
brought this in with it?

37:05.729 --> 37:08.497
Ask the military, man,
it's their satellite.

37:08.499 --> 37:09.966
I mean, okay, look.

37:09.968 --> 37:11.734
In Chad's case, the cells are

37:11.736 --> 37:13.002
hyper-replicating,
all right?

37:13.004 --> 37:15.004
His hypothalamus is growing

37:15.006 --> 37:16.372
and putting a tremendous amount

37:16.374 --> 37:18.641
of pressure on the
rest of his brain.

37:18.643 --> 37:21.510
<i>What effect would that have?</i>

37:21.512 --> 37:22.712
It's hard to say.

37:22.714 --> 37:25.281
I mean, I'm out
of my depth here, man.

37:25.283 --> 37:28.384
I mean, the hypothalamus
governs body temperature,

37:28.386 --> 37:32.655
thirst, hunger, aggression,
all kinds of stuff.

37:32.657 --> 37:34.357
Look, until the
HAZMAT guys get here,

37:34.359 --> 37:35.825
the best I can say
is maybe we just

37:35.827 --> 37:38.894
keep our eyes peeled
for anybody with symptoms

37:38.896 --> 37:42.031
and hope that it's not
readily transmittable.

37:42.033 --> 37:45.034
What about the people
who ate him?

37:45.036 --> 37:47.036
Do you think they're infected?

37:47.038 --> 37:48.638
Your guess is as good as mine

37:48.640 --> 37:50.773
when it comes to
alien bacteria, man.

38:01.418 --> 38:02.985
Preacher's Mill Police?

38:04.721 --> 38:06.422
Hey man, this is Mike.

38:06.424 --> 38:07.623
I'm out at Silver Lake

38:07.625 --> 38:09.859
and I've kind of got a problem.

38:09.861 --> 38:13.596
<i>Oh, yeah? What's that?</i>

38:13.598 --> 38:17.933
Yeah, believe it or not, but there's a
pack of fucking wild dogs out here.

38:51.368 --> 38:52.468
What the fuck?

39:06.683 --> 39:09.452
All right,
something works in this car.

39:55.866 --> 39:57.533
Holy...

40:09.112 --> 40:11.013
<i>Mom!</i>

40:38.008 --> 40:39.542
<i>Mom!</i>

40:42.212 --> 40:43.646
Jack?

40:43.648 --> 40:45.514
Mom, get the gun!

40:45.516 --> 40:47.583
Jack? Jack?

40:47.585 --> 40:49.618
<i>Get the fucking gun!</i>

41:14.712 --> 41:16.712
Mom, get the fucking gun!

41:20.750 --> 41:21.684
Shoot him!

41:22.652 --> 41:24.220
<i>Shoot him, God damn it!</i>

41:31.728 --> 41:32.561
Get away!

42:17.807 --> 42:18.941
What happened?

42:18.943 --> 42:20.709
Karen?

42:20.711 --> 42:22.545
Karen, what happened?

42:22.547 --> 42:24.880
He's gone!
My boy!

42:26.650 --> 42:27.650
What happened?

42:27.652 --> 42:29.251
He's gone.
Who did this?

42:31.087 --> 42:33.556
Karen, who did this?

42:33.558 --> 42:35.157
What is him?

42:35.159 --> 42:37.560
I don't know! He came
out of the woods.

42:37.562 --> 42:39.295
And he was chasing Jack.

42:39.297 --> 42:41.063
And he said get the gun.

42:41.065 --> 42:42.932
And I got the gun.

42:44.768 --> 42:47.937
And he killed him right
here with his bare hands.

42:47.939 --> 42:49.805
And then he tried to eat him!

42:49.807 --> 42:52.041
What?
He tried to eat him!

42:52.043 --> 42:54.610
Karen, Karen, baby,
baby, slow down.

42:57.581 --> 42:58.914
Shh.

42:58.916 --> 43:01.817
Don't shush me!
I know what I saw!

43:01.819 --> 43:03.786
And he tried to eat him!

43:05.155 --> 43:07.156
It's okay, darlin.
It's okay, baby.

43:11.928 --> 43:13.195
Stu!

43:13.197 --> 43:14.630
Who are those people?

43:22.672 --> 43:23.672
Hey!

43:23.674 --> 43:25.741
Get the fuck off my land!

43:33.750 --> 43:35.918
Get in the house!
Get in, now!

43:41.057 --> 43:42.691
Shit, man.

43:44.094 --> 43:45.628
They really went to town.

43:45.630 --> 43:47.096
Saved me a beer, though.

43:48.264 --> 43:49.665
Mike?
What's up?

43:49.667 --> 43:50.933
Who's that?
Hmm?

43:50.935 --> 43:52.668
Jesus.

43:52.670 --> 43:54.136
Hey, man, are you all right?

43:54.138 --> 43:55.104
Hey, whoa!

43:55.106 --> 43:57.906
Whoa! Dude!
Hold it!

43:57.908 --> 44:00.042
Get it off me!

44:47.090 --> 44:49.024
Step away from the car!

44:50.827 --> 44:52.294
I said step away
from the car now!

44:53.230 --> 44:54.430
Stop or I'll shoot!

45:03.073 --> 45:05.841
Don't look outside.
Don't look outside.

45:13.383 --> 45:16.952
Shit! Shit!

45:16.954 --> 45:18.153
Oh shit!

45:18.155 --> 45:21.023
Goddamn.

45:43.246 --> 45:44.313
Mike?

45:44.948 --> 45:45.914
Mike?

45:45.916 --> 45:47.783
Mike, oh my God!
Mike!

46:08.438 --> 46:09.338
Miss.

46:12.075 --> 46:13.308
Oh, Jesus.

46:18.848 --> 46:20.315
Come on.

46:20.317 --> 46:21.850
Come on!

46:24.053 --> 46:26.388
Get in the car!

46:26.390 --> 46:29.191
Lock the doors!

46:30.560 --> 46:31.527
Are you okay?

46:31.529 --> 46:32.561
Are you hurt?

46:32.563 --> 46:34.463
I cut myself on the door.

46:34.465 --> 46:37.332
Shit.

46:37.334 --> 46:38.500
Use this.

46:38.502 --> 46:39.468
Buckle up!

46:40.370 --> 46:42.237
Who are those people?

46:42.239 --> 46:44.173
What do they want?

46:44.175 --> 46:45.207
Hold on.

46:45.209 --> 46:47.910
What do they want?
Hold on!

46:58.121 --> 46:59.121
Reload!

47:01.424 --> 47:02.491
Come on, baby!

47:18.174 --> 47:19.541
Sweet Jesus!

47:20.910 --> 47:22.077
Brooke!
Brooke!

47:22.079 --> 47:23.879
Get back in the house now!

47:31.020 --> 47:32.354
Dad?

47:32.356 --> 47:34.089
<i>Reload, baby!</i>

47:37.160 --> 47:38.193
Come on, baby.

47:55.379 --> 48:00.082
What's going on? Who are these people?
Get up the stairs.

48:00.084 --> 48:02.184
Was there a gun? No,
I don't think so.

48:11.461 --> 48:12.995
What is wrong
with these people?

48:12.997 --> 48:14.630
I don't know,
but they're attacking!

48:26.376 --> 48:28.677
Daddy, what are we gonna do?
Go to the window!

48:28.679 --> 48:30.512
But what about you and Mom?

48:30.514 --> 48:32.915
We'll be fine! The fall
would break our legs.

48:32.917 --> 48:35.550
<i>Now, you start runningand
don't you look back!</i>

48:35.552 --> 48:37.920
I need you to do this
for me and your Mom!

48:40.123 --> 48:42.391
<i>It'll be okay, baby.</i>

48:42.393 --> 48:43.959
It'll be okay.

48:58.942 --> 49:00.042
Karen!

49:11.321 --> 49:12.654
It's gonna be okay, ma'am.

49:12.656 --> 49:14.089
I'm gonna take you to the doc,

49:14.091 --> 49:15.590
and it's gonna be...

49:19.195 --> 49:22.397
Ma'am?
Are you okay?

49:22.399 --> 49:23.498
Are you okay?

49:24.600 --> 49:26.234
I'm gonna take you to the doc

49:26.236 --> 49:28.103
and he's gonna...

49:28.105 --> 49:29.404
Ma'am, are you okay?

51:24.487 --> 51:26.188
What the fuck?

51:31.160 --> 51:33.295
Hey! Hey!

51:33.297 --> 51:35.297
Hey.

51:35.299 --> 51:36.631
Hey, are you okay?

51:43.339 --> 51:46.374
Hey, are you okay?

51:51.714 --> 51:53.215
Jesus!

51:55.418 --> 51:56.418
Jesus!

52:28.484 --> 52:29.885
Look, is that a deer?

52:54.510 --> 52:55.810
No! No!

52:55.812 --> 52:57.712
Stop!
Oh, my God!

52:57.714 --> 52:59.214
Mrs. Brewer!

53:42.291 --> 53:44.426
No! No! No!

55:07.376 --> 55:09.377
Is that the cavalry on the way?

55:12.015 --> 55:16.484
No. There's people,
but they've...

55:16.486 --> 55:18.753
gone crazy or something.

55:18.755 --> 55:20.955
They've definitely done that.

55:20.957 --> 55:24.426
Or something.

55:24.428 --> 55:26.328
Where are the rest
of your people?

55:26.330 --> 55:27.662
I don't know.

55:32.902 --> 55:34.769
This isn't gonna work
if you don't help.

55:34.771 --> 55:37.105
You want help? My team's
vehicles are up on the road

55:37.107 --> 55:40.041
by the Silver Springs Resort.

55:40.043 --> 55:42.510
Satellite phone is inside.

55:42.512 --> 55:46.448
Dial alpha alpha three delta bravo.
Wait, wait, wait.

55:46.450 --> 55:48.450
Alpha alpha delta...

55:48.452 --> 55:50.985
Alpha alpha three,

55:50.987 --> 55:53.988
alpha alpha, oh, fuck it.

55:53.990 --> 55:56.358
It's just pain.
Let's go.

56:04.367 --> 56:05.834
Okay, okay.

56:08.437 --> 56:09.904
I'm gonna need
a lot of your help.

56:09.906 --> 56:11.606
I'll be the help if you kill

56:11.608 --> 56:13.575
anything that comes at us.

56:13.577 --> 56:14.943
Okay?
Deal?

56:14.945 --> 56:16.711
Okay.

56:16.713 --> 56:18.480
If any of those fuckers get by,

56:18.482 --> 56:21.015
you leave me and go, deal?

56:21.017 --> 56:22.617
Let's just get to that phone.

59:04.713 --> 59:05.747
Stephanie?

59:16.792 --> 59:17.859
Steph?

59:18.294 --> 59:20.562
<i>Steph?</i>

59:20.564 --> 59:21.763
<i>Are you okay?</i>

59:23.933 --> 59:25.600
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

59:26.969 --> 59:29.137
<i>Come on out of there, sweetheart.</i>

59:30.873 --> 59:33.007
Come on. It's okay. I'm here.

59:33.009 --> 59:35.810
Oh, come here.
I gotcha.

59:35.812 --> 59:37.345
I gotcha.

59:39.582 --> 59:41.215
Steph, what are you
doing out here?

59:41.217 --> 59:45.019
They tore
Mrs. Brewer's arm off.

59:45.021 --> 59:48.690
Shh, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

59:52.261 --> 59:55.296
Can you stand? Yeah, I got it.
Get their weapons!

59:58.601 --> 59:59.801
To the truck.

01:00:18.087 --> 01:00:19.287
There's no phone in here!

01:00:19.289 --> 01:00:21.189
Check the other truck!

01:01:09.805 --> 01:01:11.139
What's the number?

01:01:13.108 --> 01:01:19.247
Alpha alpha three delta bravo
alpha alpha.

01:02:22.811 --> 01:02:23.945
Okay, Steph.

01:02:23.947 --> 01:02:25.480
I'll be right back, okay?

01:02:28.283 --> 01:02:30.451
Just, lock the doors
and don't open them

01:02:30.453 --> 01:02:32.220
for anybody except for me.

01:02:34.356 --> 01:02:36.290
And you know what?
Even if it is me,

01:02:36.292 --> 01:02:41.095
only open it if I knock
three times, okay?

01:02:41.097 --> 01:02:43.297
How many times
am I gonna knock, Steph?

01:02:43.299 --> 01:02:44.465
Three.

01:02:46.935 --> 01:02:48.436
Three. That a girl.

01:03:21.036 --> 01:03:22.069
Max?

01:03:28.577 --> 01:03:30.278
Did you get them dogs?

01:03:32.014 --> 01:03:33.381
<i>Man, I am really hungry.</i>

01:03:33.383 --> 01:03:35.950
<i>You got anything to eat?</i>

01:03:40.923 --> 01:03:41.956
Jesus.

01:03:47.296 --> 01:03:50.097
Davidson, what happened?

01:03:50.099 --> 01:03:55.169
Oh, alien virus one,
Preacher's Mill zero.

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:04.011
I got some people
locked up in the...

01:04:04.013 --> 01:04:07.315
the cage there, shot
some others out here.

01:04:09.451 --> 01:04:11.552
I got whatever it is
unless this is

01:04:11.554 --> 01:04:15.590
the worst case of pollen
outbreak in history.

01:04:15.592 --> 01:04:17.992
Oh, I let the girls go.

01:04:17.994 --> 01:04:20.561
Seemed the thing to do
under the circumstances.

01:05:01.603 --> 01:05:07.108
Make it stop! Make it stop!
Make it stop!

01:05:20.322 --> 01:05:23.524
It burns! It burns! It burns!

01:05:26.695 --> 01:05:28.095
Get it out!

01:05:33.969 --> 01:05:37.939
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!

01:05:39.709 --> 01:05:40.441
Oh!

01:06:02.965 --> 01:06:04.031
Davidson!

01:06:06.601 --> 01:06:07.368
Shit!

01:06:09.705 --> 01:06:10.671
No!

01:06:19.481 --> 01:06:21.048
Stu?

01:06:21.984 --> 01:06:23.184
Run!

01:06:31.493 --> 01:06:32.460
Damn it!

01:06:50.145 --> 01:06:53.080
Stu! Steph is in the car.

01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:54.682
What?

01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:17.038
Steph! Steph!

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.339
Daddy?

01:07:18.341 --> 01:07:19.774
Roll the window down, baby.

01:07:19.776 --> 01:07:21.475
Put the window down!

01:07:21.477 --> 01:07:22.777
Put the window down!

01:07:24.279 --> 01:07:25.813
I can't, Daddy!
I can't.

01:07:25.815 --> 01:07:27.681
Okay. Try the key
in the ignition

01:07:27.683 --> 01:07:31.052
<i>Give it a turn. Give it a turn.</i>

01:07:31.054 --> 01:07:33.754
<i>That's it! That a girl!
That a girl!</i>

01:07:33.756 --> 01:07:37.191
<i>That's right. Right there.
Hurry!</i>

01:07:39.095 --> 01:07:40.194
Come on.
Come to me.

01:07:40.196 --> 01:07:41.362
Don't even look at him.

01:07:41.364 --> 01:07:42.763
Don't worry about
him, sweetheart.

01:07:42.765 --> 01:07:44.799
Don't look at him! Don't
look at him, sweetheart!

01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:47.568
Come on, baby. I gotcha.
I gotcha.

01:07:48.437 --> 01:07:50.671
I gotcha.
I gotcha.

01:07:58.413 --> 01:08:00.114
Oh God.

01:10:17.852 --> 01:10:19.954
<i>Somebody, please.</i>

01:10:24.759 --> 01:10:26.227
<i>Please.</i>

01:14:20.596 --> 01:14:24.832
<i>About the same as
that of a satellite hitting</i>

01:14:24.834 --> 01:14:28.902
<i>South Mountain, I would say.</i>

01:14:28.904 --> 01:14:34.908
<i>Until I feel differently,
this is just how it has to be.</i>

01:15:09.645 --> 01:15:10.577
Whoa!

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:17.150
God, motherfuckers!

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.194
Come on!

01:15:43.945 --> 01:15:46.847
<i>I knew you were alive.</i>

01:15:50.251 --> 01:15:52.853
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:15:52.855 --> 01:15:54.922
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:16:00.028 --> 01:16:04.698
<i>You don't know how much
it means to me to see you safe.</i>

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:07.167
<i>I wanted to be with you.</i>

01:16:14.642 --> 01:16:17.311
<i>Why won't you
let me back there?</i>

01:16:19.347 --> 01:16:23.917
<i>I got whatever this is.</i>

01:16:23.919 --> 01:16:30.791
<i>And I don't knowhow long
I can control myself.</i>

01:16:33.361 --> 01:16:34.227
<i>You know.</i>

01:17:06.961 --> 01:17:09.763
<i>Your father's alive.</i>

01:17:09.765 --> 01:17:11.798
<i>Steph is too.</i>

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.134
<i>They left herea little while ago,</i>

01:17:14.136 --> 01:17:16.303
<i>headed towards Ashland.</i>

01:17:16.305 --> 01:17:18.305
<i>As far as I could tell anyway.</i>

01:17:26.314 --> 01:17:28.982
<i>Max!</i>

01:17:28.984 --> 01:17:31.051
<i>Oh, my God, Max.</i>

01:17:31.053 --> 01:17:31.985
Brooke?

01:17:31.987 --> 01:17:33.153
Use the front door.

01:17:33.155 --> 01:17:34.388
The front door!

01:17:43.064 --> 01:17:44.765
I knew you were alive.

01:18:01.249 --> 01:18:03.116
I love you, Brooke.

01:18:05.219 --> 01:18:08.221
You're my everything.

01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:13.160
You're my stars.

01:18:13.162 --> 01:18:14.394
My moon.

01:18:15.296 --> 01:18:17.264
<i>My whole world.</i>

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.200
Max.

01:18:23.304 --> 01:18:26.907
I'll always love you,
even after I'm gone.

01:18:34.716 --> 01:18:38.351
I just hope that you
can take this ring

01:18:38.353 --> 01:18:43.023
as a token of my love.

01:18:46.127 --> 01:18:46.993
Damn it.

01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:52.065
You know, it's been kind
of one of those days, huh.

01:18:54.936 --> 01:19:00.407
Well, it'll be back here
for you when I'm gone.

01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:03.276
Max.

01:19:09.016 --> 01:19:10.751
I love you.

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:17.758
I love you.

01:19:24.832 --> 01:19:26.366
I'd tell you to run for help,

01:19:26.368 --> 01:19:31.171
but I don't think the odds are
in your favor at this point.

01:19:34.542 --> 01:19:36.409
The entire valley's
in quarantine.

01:19:36.411 --> 01:19:39.379
They told me I just
had to stay put.

01:19:39.381 --> 01:19:41.314
And of course you didn't.

01:19:46.053 --> 01:19:48.321
I was looking for you.

01:19:49.457 --> 01:19:52.025
I came out here
looking for you!

01:20:01.135 --> 01:20:03.904
Well, if you're up
for a challenge,

01:20:03.906 --> 01:20:06.139
grab one of those
guns up front.

01:20:06.141 --> 01:20:09.209
Maybe we can get these
people to listen to reason.

01:21:17.511 --> 01:21:19.079
Go!

01:21:27.088 --> 01:21:29.089
<i>Brooke!</i>
