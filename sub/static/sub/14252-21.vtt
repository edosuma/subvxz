00:23.357 --> 00:28.278
Alert, alert, decompression on platform
six eight four. Brace for hull rupture.

00:28.278 --> 00:31.490
Thrusters are down. We're going to crash!

00:34.826 --> 00:38.163
Hey, what do you think? Look at the detail on the dorsal plating.

00:38.163 --> 00:41.500
Impressive. Are you sure you're willing to part with it?

00:41.500 --> 00:44.002
I just hope your boy enjoys it as much as I do.

00:44.002 --> 00:48.590
I'm certain he will, if we make it home in time for his birthday.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.633
We'll make it.

00:50.676 --> 00:52.553
If you and Savar had a child of your own

00:52.553 --> 00:55.055
you'd have an excuse to play with toys more often.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.643
I'm detecting a fluctuation in tank four.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.563
There's a full scale rupture in progress.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.482
Isolate the deck. Activate the emergency containment field.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.402
The emergency systems are offline.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.990
Backup controls are down too. Eject the tank.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.743
- Here? There's an inhabited system.
- We have no choice!

01:19.246 --> 01:22.583
- The ejection ports aren't responding.
- Impossible.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.336
There's another rupture forming in tank six.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.176
We'll have to send somebody down there to seal off the tanks manually.

01:32.384 --> 01:35.721
- Contact the theta core.
- Communications are down.

01:38.223 --> 01:41.351
Get down to the injector pod and seal those tanks.

01:41.476 --> 01:44.688
- I didn't sign up for core labour.
- I'm giving you an order.

01:44.897 --> 01:47.816
- I'll be contaminated.
- Now!

03:47.936 --> 03:52.107
The flame, like emotion, is a primitive force.

03:53.358 --> 03:57.321
Left unchecked, it's chaotic, destructive,

03:57.529 --> 04:01.074
but if controlled it can be a powerful tool.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.662
The lamp controls the flame, as you must learn to control your emotions.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.790
I lost my temper.
No big deal.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.127
You destroyed the Doctor's holographic camera.

04:12.336 --> 04:15.881
I told him three times to leave Engineering,

04:15.881 --> 04:19.635
but he kept buzzing around snapping pictures for some photo essay.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.346
A day in the life of the warp core.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.308
I apologised, and I replicated him a new camera.

04:27.351 --> 04:29.853
You have a long history of emotional volatility.

04:31.104 --> 04:35.275
The point of this exercise is not to atone for past transgressions,

04:35.275 --> 04:37.361
but to prevent future ones.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.029
You can't order someone to meditate.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.366
Commander Chakotay thinks otherwise.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.755
Are my eyes supposed to be open or closed for this part.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.258
Whichever allows you to focus your mind.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.182
Envision the flame burning within you.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.476
Sorry.

05:11.353 --> 05:15.524
The flame grows hotter.
A point of white light.

05:16.358 --> 05:20.946
Follow it backward through the years to a time when you were younger, a child.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.325
Is there something amusing, Lieutenant?

05:27.411 --> 05:30.747
I'm sorry, an image just flashed through my mind.

05:31.582 --> 05:37.421
You as a child. Those pointy little ears. You must have been cute.

05:38.463 --> 05:43.677
Indeed. Please follow my instructions or we'll discontinue this exercise.

05:44.094 --> 05:47.222
Right. Me, childhood. How old?

05:47.222 --> 05:49.516
Your earliest memories.

05:50.142 --> 05:54.313
Try to recall a time when you experienced uncontrollable anger.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.029
- Daniel Bird?
- I beg your pardon?

06:04.114 --> 06:07.034
He was one of my classmates in grammar school.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.953
He was always terrorising me.

06:12.456 --> 06:16.210
He used to point at my cranial ridges and tease me about being half-Klingon.

06:18.504 --> 06:24.760
- He called me Miss Turtlehead.
- That angered you.

06:24.760 --> 06:33.101
Of course, it did. So I attacked him once, during recess, on the gyro-swing.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.395
I disengaged the centrifugal governor.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.106
He was spinning so fast, he almost flew apart.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.817
Then I yanked him off the swing and started pounding his little face!

06:41.026 --> 06:43.320
If Miss Malvin hadn't showed up, I probably would have...

06:43.320 --> 06:46.240
Describe the anger you felt at that moment.

06:47.282 --> 06:52.079
I, I wanted to hurt him.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.667
To take revenge for all the humiliation he caused me.

06:57.709 --> 07:04.383
Your anger was a source of strength.
It protected you, gave you courage.

07:06.885 --> 07:07.511
I suppose it did.

07:07.719 --> 07:11.473
And when the Doctor tried to take a holo-photograph of you?

07:12.099 --> 07:15.227
I was annoyed.
He kept getting in the way.

07:16.895 --> 07:21.275
The rage within you runs deep.
It's been with you for many years.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.151
I'm not a Vulcan.
I'll survive.

07:24.820 --> 07:28.156
Whatever you say, Miss Turtlehead.

07:28.574 --> 07:30.033
What did you say!

07:30.242 --> 07:34.621
You're easily provoked. You must learn to master your emotions.

07:34.830 --> 07:39.835
I've had enough mastery for one day. School's out.

07:52.556 --> 07:55.058
So, how'd it go with B'Elanna today?

07:55.267 --> 07:57.769
Our meditation sessions are confidential.

07:58.604 --> 08:01.523
No, I'm not asking for sordid details.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.400
I just want to know if you think you can help her.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.571
Her training will be a challenge for both of us.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.159
Take it from me, getting B'Elanna to control her temper

08:12.159 --> 08:15.078
is like convincing a Ferengi to leave his estate to charity.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.415
Captain, we're receiving an automated distress call.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.666
Origin?

08:19.666 --> 08:24.463
Co-ordinates one twenty one by two six eight. Range, two billion kilometres.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.174
- Who's sending it?
- I can't tell.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.885
Let them know help's on the way.
Set a course, Mister Paris.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.151
Thirty seven escape pods.

08:46.777 --> 08:49.071
They're contaminated with theta radiation.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.573
- Malon?
- Possibly. Life signs?

08:52.407 --> 08:53.867
Two, but they're erratic.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.038
Beam them to Sickbay. Initiate bio-hazard containment procedures.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.375
Theta radiation has affected a radius of six hundred million kilometres.

09:01.792 --> 09:02.626
Source?

09:03.460 --> 09:07.214
A Malon freighter travelling at high impulse. It appears to be abandoned.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.219
I thought we'd seen the last of the Malon.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.764
I guess they're looking for new places to dump their toxic waste.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.475
Do we know what happened to their ship? Were they attacked?

09:18.475 --> 09:21.395
I'm just as curious as you are. Can you revive either of them?

09:29.319 --> 09:30.988
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway.

09:32.239 --> 09:38.912
Fesek, Controller Fesek. Where am I?

09:39.121 --> 09:41.832
You're on my vessel.
We responded to your distress call.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.917
- My ship?
- It's heavily damaged.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.045
- Where?
- Three million kilometres from here.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.339
That's too close.
We've got to get further away.

09:49.339 --> 09:53.927
Calm down, calm down. Tell me what's wrong with your ship.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.596
Why did you abandon it?

09:58.932 --> 10:02.895
- We were on a waste export mission.
- Dumping theta radiation.

10:03.729 --> 10:06.440
Two of the theta tanks ruptured.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.734
Systems malfunctioned one by one,

10:08.734 --> 10:11.445
communications, navigation, propulsion.

10:12.070 --> 10:16.658
We had no choice. Radiation was venting from every port.

10:17.701 --> 10:21.455
Over sixty crewmen died within minutes. It was chaos.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.626
We stumbled through the gas to get to the escape pods.

10:26.668 --> 10:34.176
Only a few of us made it.
Where are the others?

10:35.636 --> 10:38.347
The two of you were the only ones we found alive.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.068
Listen to me very carefully.

10:52.528 --> 10:56.281
The fact that we're still here means the ship hasn't exploded, yet.

10:56.907 --> 11:02.538
When it does, over four trillion isotons of anti-matter waste is going to ignite.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.291
Everything within three light-years will be destroyed.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.462
- Janeway to the Bridge.
- Go ahead.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.756
Put at least five light years between us and the Malon freighter.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.633
- Quickly.
- You heard her, Tom.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.093
Send out a sector-wide alert.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.221
Warn any other ships in the vicinity to Evacuate immediately.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.349
Our warp field just collapsed.

11:22.558 --> 11:25.060
All this theta radiation.
It's disrupting subspace.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.354
Can you re-initialise the field?

11:27.771 --> 11:28.605
Negative.

11:30.274 --> 11:36.113
Tuvok. Without warp drive there's no chance we'll clear the blast radius.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.155
Agreed.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.867
Mister Paris, set a course for the freighter. Full impulse.

11:39.867 --> 11:40.909
- Aye, Captain.
- What?

11:41.535 --> 11:44.037
If we can't outrun your ship,
maybe we can disable it.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.706
Every deck has been contaminated.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.625
Anyone who goes on board will liquefy within minutes.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.128
- We'll find a way.
- We?

11:51.128 --> 11:53.213
I'm not going anywhere near that vessel.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.801
You can either stay and help us or I'll send you back to your escape pod.

11:57.801 --> 11:58.844
Your choice.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.640
Clean them up, Doctor. I need them on the Bridge.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.494
How long until those storage tanks explode?

12:24.494 --> 12:26.163
Approximately six hours.

12:26.163 --> 12:27.831
Can we get an away team on board?

12:27.831 --> 12:31.168
The freighter's hull is intact. Life support appears to be operational.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.670
However, thirty three of forty two decks

12:33.670 --> 12:35.756
are flooded with high levels of theta radiation.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.216
Including the control room,

12:37.216 --> 12:39.927
which is where we have to go to re-establish containment.

12:39.927 --> 12:40.761
As I told you.

12:40.761 --> 12:43.263
We could beam on to one of the lower levels where there's less radiation,

12:43.263 --> 12:45.766
and vent the contaminated sections one by one.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.643
Clear a path to the control room.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.562
I appreciate what you're trying to do,

12:50.771 --> 12:52.856
but if what you're considering were possible,

12:52.856 --> 12:55.150
we'd have tried it before we abandoned the ship.

12:55.776 --> 12:59.112
We have years of experience aboard freighters of this gradient.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.241
Your experience is what got us into this mess in the first place.

13:02.241 --> 13:03.909
That's enough, Lieutenant.

13:04.535 --> 13:06.203
Maybe there's another way.

13:06.829 --> 13:07.871
I'm listening.

13:08.288 --> 13:12.042
Four hours from here there's a nebula that could protect us from the blast.

13:12.668 --> 13:15.587
We could alter course, wait there until after the explosion.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.341
There are at least three other ships in the sector. What about them?

13:21.218 --> 13:22.886
I don't see what we can do.

13:23.095 --> 13:24.972
So hundreds of people become contaminated

13:24.972 --> 13:26.849
because you're not willing to clean up your garbage.

13:26.849 --> 13:32.062
Lieutenant. Assemble an away team. We're going over there.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.147
Wait!

13:35.607 --> 13:37.067
Tell them about the vihaar.

13:38.110 --> 13:41.446
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing. It's a myth.

13:41.655 --> 13:42.698
What kind of myth?

13:43.323 --> 13:46.660
It's an old story shared among freighter crews.

13:47.703 --> 13:52.082
Some of them say they've seen creatures in the theta storage tanks.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.419
- Creatures?
- Created by radiogenic waste.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.338
According to the legend,

13:58.338 --> 14:03.135
they are poisonous monsters that wreak havoc aboard Malon ships.

14:03.969 --> 14:07.931
It's a common belief among our more superstitious recruits.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.808
I never believed it myself,

14:09.808 --> 14:12.936
but during the evacuation some of the crew people saw something. A form.

14:13.145 --> 14:16.273
Hallucinations are one of the first symptoms of theta poisoning.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.316
You know that.

14:17.316 --> 14:20.235
Maybe. Then how do you explain what happened?

14:20.444 --> 14:21.904
We checked every system.

14:22.321 --> 14:25.032
You'd say anything to get out of going back to that freighter.

14:25.657 --> 14:29.620
If you'd been there, you'd be afraid to go back, too.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.833
This chamber seems to be the least affected by radiation.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.293
We'll beam in there.

14:36.502 --> 14:38.587
That's fifteen decks below the control room.

14:39.213 --> 14:40.672
We'll have to work our way up.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.800
The pressurisation systems, they're offline.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.677
How will we vent the gas?

14:45.886 --> 14:47.346
There are two main airlocks on each deck.

14:47.346 --> 14:48.805
We'll open them as we go.

14:49.014 --> 14:51.308
Perform a series of controlled decompressions.

14:51.517 --> 14:52.976
What's to stop us from being vented?

14:53.185 --> 14:57.981
Forcefields. I spent six years aboard a Talaxian garbage scow.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.484
I know a few things about waste management.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.403
Even low levels of theta radiation can be lethal.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.489
Our Doctor's developed an inoculation.

15:05.489 --> 15:08.825
It'll temporarily prevent our cells from absorbing the radiation.

15:09.034 --> 15:11.745
- How long will it last?
- Two, three hours.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.039
Half of the doors and bulkheads are fused. The ascenders are offline.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.542
It could take us twice as long as that to reach the control room.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.001
Then we'll have to work quickly.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.504
We'll take phasers to cut through any obstacles.

15:20.921 --> 15:23.423
I've ordered my men to do a lot of risky things,

15:23.841 --> 15:25.926
but nothing as foolish as this.

15:25.926 --> 15:29.680
More foolish than towing around a trillion isotons of toxic waste?

15:29.680 --> 15:32.182
We take every precaution to keep it contained.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.851
Until you dump it in someone's back yard.

15:34.268 --> 15:36.770
Is your crew always so diplomatic?

15:37.187 --> 15:40.107
Your concerns are noted.
Get them inoculated.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.775
We'll meet you in Transporter Room one.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.614
We're trying to avoid explosions, remember?

15:49.908 --> 15:51.785
Not another lecture about my emotions.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.288
No, a lecture about how to treat guests aboard this ship.

15:54.288 --> 15:57.416
Guests? Chakotay, these people are the scourge of the quadrant.

15:57.416 --> 16:00.752
Agreed, but right now they're our only hope of repairing that freighter,

16:00.961 --> 16:02.421
so I suggest you make friends.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.843
Diplomacy.
Janeway's answer to everything.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.762
This isn't the Captain talking, it's me, and I'm giving you an order.

16:10.971 --> 16:14.099
Keep your temper in check. Understood?

16:15.767 --> 16:17.436
- Understood?
- Yeah.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.313
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes.

16:19.521 --> 16:23.483
B'Elanna, I need your expertise on this mission, not your bad mood.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.195
I'll see what I can do.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.054
Ready, Neelix?

16:52.054 --> 16:54.348
Ah, not quite. Do we still have a minute?

16:54.556 --> 16:57.893
It's just it's not quite strong enough yet.

16:58.101 --> 17:02.898
Now, would you mind passing me that little dish?

17:03.106 --> 17:05.400
Neelix, I admire your dedication,

17:05.400 --> 17:07.277
but the crew can figure out lunch on their own.

17:08.319 --> 17:12.074
Lunch, and dinner, and a midnight snack have all been taken care of.

17:12.281 --> 17:17.079
This is for me. It's a Talaxian theta radiation remedy.

17:17.913 --> 17:20.624
Crushed rama leaf and katyllian clove.

17:20.624 --> 17:23.126
It helps fortify the cellular membranes.

17:23.252 --> 17:25.628
I think the Doctor's inoculation might be a better way to go.

17:26.255 --> 17:32.928
Every little bit helps. Oh, by the way, thank you.

17:33.345 --> 17:33.971
For what?

17:34.179 --> 17:36.056
For sending me on such an important mission.

17:36.682 --> 17:39.601
Not that my duties in the Mess hall aren't challenging.

17:39.810 --> 17:42.521
It was an easy choice. You were the best man for the job.

17:42.729 --> 17:47.734
Well, our scow once ran smack into a theta radiation field.

17:47.943 --> 17:51.280
Knocked the propulsion out. We had no choice but to sit there.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.199
We were barely alive when they found us.

17:54.616 --> 17:57.536
If it hadn't been for this, nobody would have survived.

18:11.091 --> 18:15.888
Once you get past the choking reflex it's really not so bad.

18:16.305 --> 18:17.139
Want to try some?

18:17.556 --> 18:18.807
I'll take my chances.

18:19.016 --> 18:22.144
Transporter room one to Commander Chakotay. We're ready to proceed.

18:22.561 --> 18:23.604
On our way.

18:27.566 --> 18:31.111
B'Elanna. Aren't you forgetting something?

18:31.737 --> 18:32.779
I don't think so.

18:34.448 --> 18:35.908
A good-bye would be nice.

18:35.908 --> 18:38.827
So long, see you soon, something along those lines.

18:38.827 --> 18:39.453
I didn't want to risk it.

18:39.453 --> 18:41.330
- Risk what?
- Starting an argument.

18:41.538 --> 18:42.998
Argument? Us?

18:44.041 --> 18:46.126
So, I hear it's been a short fuse kind of day.

18:46.335 --> 18:49.463
- About this long.
- Nothing you can't handle.

18:49.463 --> 18:51.131
- If you think so.
- I know so.

18:53.217 --> 18:54.885
I suppose it's always going to be like this.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.970
- Like what?
- Me against the galaxy.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.264
Well, the galaxy doesn't stand a chance.

18:59.681 --> 19:03.644
Now, promise me that you're going to be careful over there.

19:04.061 --> 19:05.521
No stopping to have fun.

19:05.729 --> 19:08.649
Fun?
On a Malon freighter?

19:10.734 --> 19:11.777
See you soon.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.294
Well, it's nothing a fresh coat of paint wouldn't brighten up.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.171
This way.

19:32.005 --> 19:36.176
Theta radiation density, twenty million ev per cubic metre.

19:36.802 --> 19:41.807
Structural integrity's holding. Wish I could say the same for my lungs.

19:44.518 --> 19:45.561
What was that?

19:45.769 --> 19:48.897
This corridor's filled with methogenic particles, highly charged.

19:50.774 --> 19:54.111
Something's causing an electrostatic cascade.

19:54.945 --> 19:58.282
Our scanning signals are igniting the particles. It's the tricorders!

19:58.699 --> 19:59.950
Take cover.

20:09.126 --> 20:10.169
No more tricorders.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.302
Control mechanisms are down.

20:18.302 --> 20:19.970
We're going to have to open the air locks manually.

20:21.847 --> 20:23.307
Wait here.
We'll take care of it.

20:23.724 --> 20:27.060
- B'Elanna, go with him.
- We can do this ourselves.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.146
I'd prefer to keep an eye on your progress.

20:29.354 --> 20:31.857
You're on my freighter.
I'm in charge here.

20:31.857 --> 20:33.108
You abandoned ship, remember?

20:33.317 --> 20:34.985
You take your orders from me.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.156
We'll have to crawl into an injector port.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.450
It's only big enough for two people.

20:42.701 --> 20:43.744
Pelk, you stay with us.

20:46.663 --> 20:47.706
Shall we?

20:58.342 --> 21:00.427
How can you stand to work in these conditions?

21:00.636 --> 21:02.095
You think we're animals, don't you?

21:02.513 --> 21:04.389
You said it, not me.

21:05.224 --> 21:07.100
I'm a waste controller half the year.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.811
Do you know what I do the rest of the time?

21:11.480 --> 21:13.982
- I'm a sculptor.
- What's your point?

21:14.816 --> 21:17.736
Every year I give up work I love

21:17.736 --> 21:21.698
to expose myself to radiation that will probably cut my life in half.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.367
Then why do it?

21:23.575 --> 21:27.538
Have you ever been to Malon Prime? It's a remarkable place.

21:27.746 --> 21:30.457
It's one of the most beautiful worlds you'll ever see.

21:31.917 --> 21:34.419
Our planet would choke with industrial wastes

21:34.419 --> 21:37.130
if it weren't for the sacrifices of people like me.

21:37.548 --> 21:39.842
How many worlds are you willing to contaminate

21:39.842 --> 21:42.135
to keep your own home so tidy?

21:42.553 --> 21:47.975
Do you have any idea of the trouble we go to, to locate isolated areas?

21:55.274 --> 21:59.653
Ah, manual actuators.
I'll release them,

21:59.653 --> 22:01.530
you monitor the pressure variance.

22:01.738 --> 22:02.364
Right.

22:06.118 --> 22:09.079
- Do you have any children?
- No.

22:09.663 --> 22:13.417
I have a son.
He's seven years old.

22:14.251 --> 22:17.171
He wants to be a waste controller when he grows up.

22:17.171 --> 22:20.090
You must be very proud.

22:22.176 --> 22:22.801
Ready.

22:24.469 --> 22:28.015
Torres to Chakotay. Stand by for the decompression sequence.

22:28.223 --> 22:28.849
Acknowledged.

22:43.447 --> 22:44.281
It didn't work.

22:45.115 --> 22:47.826
There's something jamming the airlock controls.

22:49.077 --> 22:53.040
Torres to Chakotay. We've got a problem. The actuators aren't working.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.125
Somebody's going to have to go up there and take a look.

22:55.334 --> 22:57.836
Wait. That deck is still contaminated.

22:58.670 --> 23:02.216
I'll go. I've been exposed to worse.

23:03.050 --> 23:03.884
Wait.

23:08.055 --> 23:09.306
One for the road.

23:10.349 --> 23:12.017
It's probably just the uncouplers.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.520
They're always getting encrusted with oxides.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.085
Who's there?

24:05.612 --> 24:11.451
Help! I, I saw it.
I saw it.

24:11.451 --> 24:14.163
- What?
- The creature.

24:19.585 --> 24:21.253
Give me twenty cc's of anectazine.

24:25.007 --> 24:27.301
Chakotay to Voyager.
Transporter status.

24:27.926 --> 24:30.012
Still too much interference. I'll try compensating.

24:30.012 --> 24:31.680
Stand by for further instructions.

24:32.306 --> 24:33.974
- What happened?
- We don't know.

24:33.974 --> 24:36.685
He went away for a minute, he screamed, and we found him here.

24:36.894 --> 24:38.562
These look like chemical burns.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.856
Without tricorders, it's hard to make a diagnosis.

24:41.690 --> 24:42.733
It's here.

24:43.567 --> 24:46.069
- What?
- The creature.

24:46.904 --> 24:51.492
You're hallucinating. It's the radiation, but you're going to be alright.

24:51.700 --> 24:57.539
No. It attacked me. It...

24:59.416 --> 25:01.293
He's going into shock.
Cortical stimulator.

25:01.502 --> 25:03.170
Pelk, get up!

25:07.966 --> 25:09.426
He's not responding.

25:22.773 --> 25:24.024
He said the creature attacked him.

25:24.441 --> 25:29.446
He imagined it. He was probably scalded when that conduit ruptured.

25:29.655 --> 25:31.740
Or maybe there is someone else on this ship.

25:34.243 --> 25:36.954
Voyager to away team. Transporter interference has cleared.

25:36.954 --> 25:38.622
We're locking onto your co-ordinates. Stand by.

25:39.039 --> 25:43.001
Harry, Pelk is dead. Lock onto his signal and beam him to Sickbay.

25:43.627 --> 25:46.129
Ask the Doctor to determine the cause of death.

25:46.129 --> 25:46.755
Aye sir.

25:50.926 --> 25:53.011
Someone still needs to get up there and open the airlocks.

25:53.846 --> 25:58.433
- Me.
- Hold on. I'll join you.

25:58.851 --> 26:00.310
From now on nobody works alone.

26:12.823 --> 26:13.866
Progress?

26:14.074 --> 26:16.160
They've vented five decks. Ten to go.

26:16.577 --> 26:19.705
At this rate, they'll reach the control room in approximately three hours.

26:20.122 --> 26:23.458
However, the storage tanks will detonate in less than two.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.335
I've been working on a contingency plan.

26:27.212 --> 26:28.463
An O type star.

26:28.881 --> 26:31.175
If the freighter exploded within the star's corona

26:31.175 --> 26:32.634
it might absorb the radiation.

26:33.468 --> 26:35.345
The star is not on the freighter's trajectory.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.431
What if we gave it a little nudge?

26:38.265 --> 26:40.767
A series of carefully timed tractor pulses

26:40.767 --> 26:42.019
could alter the freighter's course,

26:42.644 --> 26:44.313
but given the vessel's weakened state,

26:44.313 --> 26:46.190
one miscalculation could set off the explosion.

26:46.190 --> 26:48.066
I'm still counting on the away team to succeed,

26:48.692 --> 26:50.777
but I want to be ready with plan B if they don't.

26:54.323 --> 26:58.076
I don't know about the rest of you but I could sure use a sonic shower.

26:58.494 --> 27:01.413
I'd like to soak in a hot bath for a day or two.

27:01.413 --> 27:03.499
Oh no, not me. I want to feel those sonic pulses

27:03.499 --> 27:06.418
dissolving every last atom of this grime off my body.

27:06.418 --> 27:08.921
We have a decontamination bay on board

27:08.921 --> 27:11.632
that can purge over fifty workers at a time.

27:11.757 --> 27:13.217
Well that sounds like fun.

27:18.931 --> 27:19.556
B'Elanna?

27:21.642 --> 27:23.310
I'm okay. I'm just a little light-headed.

27:27.064 --> 27:28.941
- Your hand.
- Oh God.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.737
Freighter blight from the prolonged exposure.

27:33.862 --> 27:34.780
Lovely.

27:35.197 --> 27:37.699
In my business, it's an occupational hazard.

27:38.325 --> 27:39.993
We'd better try inoculating you again.

27:40.202 --> 27:43.121
If she's blistering, she's already received a fatal dose of radiation.

27:43.121 --> 27:45.624
- She needs treatment.
- I'll live. Let's keep moving.

27:46.250 --> 27:49.378
We have medicines in the infirmary.
It's only two sections from here.

27:49.378 --> 27:51.255
We don't have time for a detour.

27:51.255 --> 27:54.383
B'Elanna, go with him. We'll meet you outside the control room.

27:54.383 --> 27:56.677
- Chakotay, I'm fine.
- I said go!

28:12.109 --> 28:15.654
This is the infirmary? Looks more like a morgue.

28:20.450 --> 28:21.910
What happened to him?

28:22.953 --> 28:25.873
It looks like he was being treated for long term exposure.

28:26.290 --> 28:28.792
He was probably left behind during the evacuation.

28:29.626 --> 28:30.669
Tough luck, huh?

28:31.503 --> 28:34.840
There was nothing more we could do for him. He was a core labourer.

28:35.883 --> 28:36.925
Meaning?

28:37.759 --> 28:39.636
He worked close to the storage tanks.

28:40.053 --> 28:43.182
Only three of ten core labourers survive a standard mission.

28:44.016 --> 28:45.475
Occupational hazard?

28:46.101 --> 28:48.812
They know the risks when they accept the assignment.

28:48.812 --> 28:50.689
They know they're going to end up like this?

28:51.106 --> 28:53.192
Core labourers can make more in two months

28:53.192 --> 28:54.860
than most Malon make in a lifetime.

28:55.485 --> 28:57.571
What good is the money if they're not around to collect it.

28:59.448 --> 29:01.325
It will go to his family.

29:05.078 --> 29:06.538
What is that thing?

29:06.747 --> 29:08.415
It's a subdermal injector.

29:08.624 --> 29:12.377
It contains analeptic compounds to reverse the cell damage.

29:12.377 --> 29:14.046
I feel better already.

29:15.506 --> 29:19.676
I won't hurt you. I've done this a hundred times.

29:23.847 --> 29:25.933
You'll feel a slight burning sensation.

29:30.103 --> 29:33.232
Commander. The Captain's plan B.

29:33.440 --> 29:36.777
I've calculated the inertial force required to divert the freighter.

29:37.611 --> 29:38.445
Plan C.

29:38.445 --> 29:42.199
Shield modulations that should reduce the structural damage of Voyager.

29:42.407 --> 29:45.118
It will also help protect the crew against theta radiation poisoning,

29:45.327 --> 29:46.995
if we fail.

29:47.204 --> 29:50.749
A wise precaution. With any luck, we won't be needing it.

29:50.958 --> 29:53.043
I didn't think Vulcans believed in luck.

29:53.460 --> 29:54.711
As a rule we don't,

29:54.711 --> 29:57.631
but serving with Captain Janeway has taught me otherwise.

29:58.674 --> 30:01.802
She does seem to succeed more often than random chance would allow.

30:02.427 --> 30:04.304
I'll factor it into my calculations.

30:06.598 --> 30:10.352
- Is there a Plan D?
- No.

30:17.860 --> 30:21.196
Initiating decompression sequence, deck four! Deck clear!

30:21.196 --> 30:22.656
Twelve down!
Three to go!

30:28.912 --> 30:30.789
The air locks are opening on this deck!

30:30.789 --> 30:33.917
- What!
- I can't close them.

30:34.334 --> 30:37.671
- Forcefields, where are they?
- They're offline!

30:37.880 --> 30:39.756
We've got to get off this deck. Move!

30:41.008 --> 30:41.842
This way.

31:04.156 --> 31:05.199
Chakotay!

31:06.450 --> 31:08.535
- He was right behind me.
- Torres to Chakotay.

31:10.621 --> 31:13.957
- That deck is a vacuum by now.
- Torres to Voyager.

31:14.166 --> 31:15.000
Acknowledged.

31:15.209 --> 31:17.711
Lock onto Chakotay's comm. signal and beam him to Sickbay.

31:21.882 --> 31:24.801
We've got him.
He's okay.

31:26.887 --> 31:29.389
- I thought that deck was secure!
- It was.

31:29.806 --> 31:31.683
Then why did we almost get blown into space?

31:31.683 --> 31:32.935
I don't know!

31:33.143 --> 31:35.229
Air locks don't open by themselves!

31:35.229 --> 31:36.897
What are you saying?
You think it was me?

31:37.105 --> 31:41.068
Calm down, both of you! We don't have time to argue about what happened.

31:41.068 --> 31:42.319
We've got to keep moving.

31:59.837 --> 32:00.879
Chakotay?

32:00.879 --> 32:04.007
Unconscious but stable. The Doctor is treating him now.

32:04.424 --> 32:06.093
We'll be able to talk to him in less than an hour.

32:06.301 --> 32:07.553
I'll want a full report.

32:07.970 --> 32:10.055
Shall I beam to the freighter and take command of the away team?

32:10.055 --> 32:12.558
I just spoke with B'Elanna. She's got everything under control.

32:13.809 --> 32:17.563
This is a dangerous situation. There is no margin for emotional error.

32:17.563 --> 32:20.899
We have plenty to do here. Help me remodulate the tractor beam.

32:22.985 --> 32:24.862
B'Elanna is unpredictable, Captain.

32:25.070 --> 32:28.615
Under these circumstances her volatile nature could compromise the mission.

32:28.824 --> 32:30.075
Your concerns are noted,

32:30.075 --> 32:33.203
but if I send you over there I'd be sending the wrong message.

32:33.203 --> 32:35.289
That I don't have faith in her. But I do.

32:35.706 --> 32:38.000
Your faith is admirable,
but logic suggests...

32:38.000 --> 32:39.877
This isn't about logic,
it's about trust.

32:40.502 --> 32:42.796
She'll come through for us.
Now, give me a hand.

32:47.384 --> 32:48.635
Lieutenant?

32:52.598 --> 32:56.143
Lieute...
Are you all right?

32:56.560 --> 32:59.479
Fine.
Report.

32:59.479 --> 33:03.025
We just vented the last deck. We should have a clear path to the control room.

33:05.319 --> 33:06.987
Let's get this thing over with, then.

33:07.821 --> 33:09.698
- If you need to rest.
- I said I'm fine.

33:14.286 --> 33:22.002
- I was meditating.
- Meditating? You?

33:24.505 --> 33:26.173
Do me a favour,
don't tell Tuvok.

33:28.050 --> 33:31.803
- Your secret's safe.
- It's this place.

33:33.263 --> 33:38.894
I know how you feel. The next time I volunteer to board a Malon freighter,

33:38.894 --> 33:41.396
check me into Sickbay and have my head examined.

33:42.231 --> 33:43.899
I feel like I'm ready to explode.

33:44.942 --> 33:45.984
We'll get through this together.

33:47.027 --> 33:49.947
I've got a knack for diffusing explosive situations.

33:52.032 --> 33:52.658
Thanks.

34:01.208 --> 34:03.502
- Torres to Astrometrics.
- Go ahead.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.170
We're outside the control room,

34:05.170 --> 34:07.673
but without tricorders we can't tell if it's safe to go in there.

34:08.297 --> 34:11.426
The room is too heavily shielded. Our sensors can't penetrate it.

34:11.844 --> 34:13.094
You must stand by.

34:13.303 --> 34:16.223
The theta dampening field is still active. It should be safe.

34:18.934 --> 34:20.601
After you.

34:31.864 --> 34:36.659
It's worse than I expected. The theta gas has leaked into the warp manifold.

34:37.703 --> 34:40.831
We've got less than ten minutes before this vessel explodes.

34:40.831 --> 34:42.498
Emergency systems are down.

34:44.376 --> 34:47.295
This should feed enough energy to your power matrix to re-initialise them.

34:48.130 --> 34:49.172
Try it now.

34:52.717 --> 34:54.178
They're coming back online,

34:54.178 --> 34:56.889
but only one containment grid is still operational.

34:56.889 --> 35:00.017
We have two unstable tanks.
One grid can't handle them both.

35:00.434 --> 35:02.102
We'll seal them one at a time.

35:06.064 --> 35:06.481
Doctor?

35:08.358 --> 35:10.861
- Easy, Commander.
- Ow, my head aches.

35:11.069 --> 35:13.363
I'm not surprised.
You took a severe blow.

35:14.198 --> 35:15.449
I've got to get back to the freighter.

35:15.657 --> 35:16.909
Not in this condition.

35:17.743 --> 35:19.703
If you want to help you can answer some questions

35:19.703 --> 35:21.288
about Mister Pelk's death.

35:21.914 --> 35:24.833
I've found unidentified tissue in his wounds.

35:25.667 --> 35:26.919
What sort of tissue?

35:26.919 --> 35:29.213
The computer is running a microcellular scan.

35:30.464 --> 35:35.260
- Pelk said he was attacked.
- Ah yes, the Malon Bogeyman.

35:36.094 --> 35:38.805
Microcellular analysis is complete.

35:44.561 --> 35:48.815
Odd. The tissue is saturated with theta radiation,

35:49.233 --> 35:51.109
but it's not showing signs of decay.

35:52.778 --> 35:55.280
It came from someone or something

35:55.280 --> 35:57.574
that's developed a resistance to the radiation.

35:59.034 --> 36:01.328
- Sickbay to Seven of Nine.
- Yes, Doctor.

36:01.537 --> 36:04.039
Scan for additional lifeforms aboard the Malon vessel.

36:04.039 --> 36:05.707
I've been running continuous scans.

36:05.707 --> 36:08.418
I assure you there is no one there aside from the away team.

36:08.627 --> 36:10.295
This lifeform's heavily irradiated.

36:10.295 --> 36:12.381
It could be blending in with ambient toxins.

36:14.049 --> 36:15.717
I'll recalibrate our sensors.

36:17.177 --> 36:18.220
Tank one's stable.

36:18.220 --> 36:20.097
Re-route the containment grid to the tank two.

36:21.557 --> 36:23.642
What happened?

36:23.642 --> 36:27.187
A power surge.
We're losing the grid.

36:27.396 --> 36:29.898
It was triggered from a workstation on this deck.

36:30.107 --> 36:31.358
Janeway to away team.

36:31.358 --> 36:33.861
We've detected an alien lifeform aboard the freighter.

36:33.861 --> 36:37.197
- We believe it killed Pelk.
- Captain, we just lost power.

36:37.823 --> 36:39.491
We're diverting the freighter into a nearby star.

36:39.491 --> 36:41.785
Leave the control room so we can get a lock on you.

36:41.785 --> 36:42.828
Acknowledged.

36:47.416 --> 36:50.335
- What's going on?
- It's jammed.

36:50.752 --> 36:54.298
Seven of Nine to away team.
I've detected the alien lifeform.

36:54.506 --> 36:56.383
It's moving toward your position.

37:05.350 --> 37:07.853
The gas is being routed through the environmental systems.

37:07.853 --> 37:11.607
- I'll try to shut it down.
- Is there another way out?

37:11.815 --> 37:12.232
No.

37:14.735 --> 37:17.029
- Do you have them?
- Not yet.

37:21.408 --> 37:23.494
The lifeform has entered the control room.

37:38.717 --> 37:41.428
I'm trying to vent the gas, but the release valves are jammed.

37:41.637 --> 37:44.348
Use the environmental controls instead.

37:44.348 --> 37:48.310
In the meantime, see if you can get that hatch open.

37:51.855 --> 37:52.481
Neelix?

37:55.818 --> 37:57.903
No, you'll ignite the gas.

38:04.159 --> 38:04.785
Neelix?

38:14.795 --> 38:16.255
We've got to get him back to Voyager.

38:16.463 --> 38:19.591
- Get that hatch open!
- I'm trying!

38:22.719 --> 38:24.179
Fesek, behind you!

39:14.438 --> 39:17.983
- You're a core labourer.
- Not anymore.

39:20.068 --> 39:21.111
Stay back.

39:24.448 --> 39:27.367
Don't make me kill you.

39:27.784 --> 39:29.453
I'm already dead.

39:38.212 --> 39:39.880
You've been sabotaging the ship.

39:40.297 --> 39:43.008
There's no other way to make them understand.

39:43.008 --> 39:46.970
So that's your way of getting even? Killing your crew?

39:47.179 --> 39:50.098
Causing an explosion that will contaminate other ships?

39:50.516 --> 39:52.392
They poisoned me!

40:03.654 --> 40:05.447
The freighter is on course for the star.

40:05.531 --> 40:07.825
Away team, we've adjusted the vessel's course.

40:07.825 --> 40:09.910
It's heading for an O type star.

40:09.910 --> 40:11.578
You have to get out of there now.

40:11.578 --> 40:13.872
No. No.

40:21.380 --> 40:24.091
The freighter's manoeuvring thrusters just activated.

40:24.716 --> 40:26.593
- It's altering course.
- Compensate.

40:29.304 --> 40:32.850
No effect. I'm detecting radiation surges in the theta tanks.

40:32.850 --> 40:34.518
They're going to detonate in three minutes.

40:34.518 --> 40:35.143
Harry?

40:35.561 --> 40:38.063
As long as they're in the control room I can't get a lock.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.316
Janeway to away team. Get those manoeuvring thrusters offline

40:41.400 --> 40:42.860
then get out of the contaminated area.

40:42.860 --> 40:44.945
We can't get a transporter lock on you.

40:46.613 --> 40:49.116
Get the hell away from there, now!

40:49.116 --> 40:52.035
No! It's too late!

40:55.581 --> 41:03.714
Okay. Okay. Look, I know what they've done to you.

41:04.339 --> 41:07.885
They used you. You want to hurt them. Listen, listen to me.

41:07.885 --> 41:12.472
I know. I know that you're so angry you want to destroy everything in sight,

41:12.681 --> 41:14.766
but there's another way to make them understand.

41:15.601 --> 41:18.520
I'm on your side. I can help you.

41:21.440 --> 41:24.985
Innocent people are going to die if you do this.

41:27.488 --> 41:30.407
No. It's over.

41:30.824 --> 41:35.412
Please, please.
Please let me help you.

41:36.038 --> 41:36.455
No.

41:40.626 --> 41:42.711
Step away!

41:53.347 --> 41:55.224
The Malon's thrusters are powering down.

41:56.892 --> 41:58.769
I have restored the freighter's trajectory.

41:59.811 --> 42:00.854
B'Elanna, get out of there.

42:01.688 --> 42:03.357
Come on, we've got to go.

42:11.490 --> 42:11.907
Fesek.

42:39.017 --> 42:41.311
- The away team, Mister Kim.
- I got them.

42:52.156 --> 42:56.535
- Maybe the meditation's working.
- What makes you say that.

42:57.578 --> 43:01.331
From what Neelix told me, you kept your temper in check over there.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.502
Don't expect me to make a habit of it.

43:06.336 --> 43:10.090
Well, I've repaired most of your cellular degradation.

43:11.550 --> 43:13.635
I wish I could say the same for you,

43:13.635 --> 43:16.346
but you've suffered long term systemic damage.

43:16.763 --> 43:19.057
Your condition will deteriorate over time.

43:19.683 --> 43:22.186
It's an occupational hazard.

43:22.603 --> 43:25.314
We've contacted a Malon transport ship in the next sector.

43:25.731 --> 43:27.816
We've altered course to rendezvous with them.

43:28.025 --> 43:30.527
Thank you, Captain.

43:30.736 --> 43:33.030
I don't know how I'm going to explain what happened.

43:34.072 --> 43:39.286
Tell them the truth.
Tell them the vihaar is no myth.

44:42.891 --> 44:45.185
Computer, activate sonic shower.
