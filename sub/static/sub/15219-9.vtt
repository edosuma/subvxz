<i>Leonard?</i>

00:37.660 --> 00:40.629
We appreciate
the dramatic pause, Leonard,

00:40.697 --> 00:42.858
but we're waitin'
for your answer.

00:49.305 --> 00:52.763
- Would you mind
repeating the question?
- [All Laughing]

00:52.842 --> 00:55.504
Oh, for heaven's sakes, Leonard.

00:57.113 --> 01:01.049
Everybody in Twelve Oaks Parish
knows the answer.

01:01.117 --> 01:03.585
<i>All right, all right.</i>

01:04.721 --> 01:07.622
Delilah Berry,
you're accused of murdering...

01:07.690 --> 01:12.684
<i>Houston Palmer Cotter</i>
<i>on the 15th ofJune, 1957.</i>

01:12.762 --> 01:17.461
- Murder?
- <i>How do you plead,</i>
<i>guilty or not guilty?</i>

01:21.905 --> 01:25.807
<i>Leonard.</i>
Not guilty.

01:25.875 --> 01:28.969
[Gasping]
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>What did that boy say?</i>

01:29.045 --> 01:31.411
Leonard, we had a deal!

01:31.481 --> 01:34.143
Bo! Bo!
Twenty years
for second-degree murder.

01:34.217 --> 01:36.412
<i>[Judge]</i>
<i>Order. Order in this court.</i>

01:36.486 --> 01:39.887
Now I'm going after
first-degree murder...

01:39.956 --> 01:41.947
and the electric chair.

01:43.493 --> 01:46.485
[Spectators Chattering]

03:03.806 --> 03:06.934
<i>[Bo]</i>
<i>We had a deal, Judge. A deal!</i>

03:08.478 --> 03:13.040
And Leonard just ups
and throws it out the window.

03:13.116 --> 03:16.347
I'm certain Leonard
has his reasons, Bo,

03:16.419 --> 03:20.219
and if you'll just hold your water,
we'll find out what they are.

03:20.289 --> 03:22.280
Leonard?

03:27.497 --> 03:30.466
She's innocent.
She signed a confession.

03:30.533 --> 03:33.024
<i>Bo has a point there,</i>
<i>Leonard.</i>

03:34.504 --> 03:37.337
[Thinking] Please, God,
let me say something legal.

03:38.674 --> 03:41.165
Miranda.
Miranda?

03:41.244 --> 03:44.372
Yeah, uh, she wasn't read
her Miranda rights
at the time of her arrest.

03:44.447 --> 03:47.439
What the hell are Miranda rights?

03:47.517 --> 03:51.180
Oh, you know, the right to remain silent,
the right to have your attorney present.

03:53.456 --> 03:55.390
But not until the '60s.

03:55.458 --> 03:58.393
<i>Leonard Dancey,</i>
<i>somebody's finally pulled</i>
<i>the plug on you.</i>

03:58.461 --> 04:00.429
<i>Lookee here, Leonard.</i>

04:00.496 --> 04:04.432
Lila has confessed
to killing Houston.

04:04.500 --> 04:08.596
<i>So unless you got evidence</i>
<i>to the contrary,</i>

04:08.671 --> 04:13.131
I suggest you take Bo's generous offer
and plead that gal guilty.

04:13.209 --> 04:17.509
<i>Twenty years in prison</i>
<i>is a far sight better</i>
<i>than the electric chair.</i>

04:17.579 --> 04:19.445
- She's not guilty.
- Damn!

04:19.515 --> 04:22.484
Calm down, Bo.
Calm down.

04:22.552 --> 04:25.715
<i>Leonard, did the captain know</i>
<i>you intended...</i>

04:25.788 --> 04:28.780
<i>to plead Lila not guilty?</i>

04:30.827 --> 04:34.627
- I don't think so.
- Then why did you do it, son?

04:37.066 --> 04:42.163
Because... I don't believe
she's guilty.

04:44.340 --> 04:46.638
Leonard,

04:46.709 --> 04:50.475
Lila's a mighty attractive
and warm-blooded woman.

04:50.546 --> 04:52.673
[Chuckles]

04:53.950 --> 04:57.215
And I can see why any man
would be tempted...

04:57.286 --> 05:01.882
to, uh, defend her
in spite of the facts.

05:01.958 --> 05:03.892
But believe me, son,

05:03.960 --> 05:06.952
no matter how good it is,

05:07.029 --> 05:09.657
it ain't worth
the mess you're making.

05:09.732 --> 05:11.723
Damn it, Leonard.
She's guilty.

05:13.169 --> 05:16.229
You're gonna have to prove it.

05:16.305 --> 05:18.637
<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>

05:21.477 --> 05:25.311
<i>Since the defendant</i>
<i>has pleaded not guilty,</i>

05:25.381 --> 05:28.646
this court has no recourse
but to try Delilah Berry...

05:28.718 --> 05:31.380
for the murder
of Houston Cotter.

05:32.955 --> 05:35.947
This court is adjourned
until 10:00 a.m. Monday.

05:36.959 --> 05:38.893
<i>[Spectators Chattering]</i>

05:38.961 --> 05:41.521
Why'd you do it?

05:41.597 --> 05:44.760
Because you're not guilty.
I never said that.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.893
Your eyes did.

05:46.969 --> 05:49.529
Is that necessary?

05:49.605 --> 05:52.597
Ow.
Just a minute, please.

05:52.675 --> 05:55.166
Excuse me.
I'm not done talking
with my client.

05:55.244 --> 05:59.180
You are, until visiting hours
tomorrow morning.

05:59.248 --> 06:01.739
Captain.
Captain.

06:05.788 --> 06:07.949
Leonard.

06:08.024 --> 06:11.824
Why don't I just give you
a lift home, son?

06:11.894 --> 06:13.828
All right.

06:13.896 --> 06:18.560
<i>[Sam Narrating]</i>
<i>Despite the warm voice</i>
<i>and friendly smile, I didn't like him.</i>

06:18.634 --> 06:21.125
<i>I didn't like the way people</i>
<i>parted before him...</i>

06:21.204 --> 06:24.037
<i>or the way they touched their hats</i>
<i>and said "Captain"as he passed.</i>

06:24.106 --> 06:27.701
<i>But since he was obviously</i>
<i>the man who ran this town,</i>
<i>I had to learn all I could about him.</i>

06:27.777 --> 06:30.769
<i>Besides, I had no idea</i>
<i>where I lived.</i>

06:30.846 --> 06:34.509
<i>You know, Leonard,</i>
<i>your daddy and I were partners</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

06:34.584 --> 06:36.814
A long time.

06:36.886 --> 06:40.083
That's why I feel I can
speak frankly to you.

06:40.156 --> 06:43.648
I know that, uh, Houston's trial
is your big opportunity, son.

06:43.726 --> 06:47.822
- You mean Lila's trial, don't you?
- Lila's trial.

06:48.831 --> 06:52.733
Just shows you how pain and grief
can addle a man's mind.

06:52.802 --> 06:54.736
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:54.804 --> 06:57.830
<i>But I figure that's sort oflike</i>
<i>what happened to you in court.</i>

06:57.907 --> 07:01.308
All that excitement.
The whole town watching you.

07:01.377 --> 07:04.813
I reckon you just
got carried away, huh?

07:04.880 --> 07:07.440
<i>Like a pup on his first hunt.</i>
I'm not a pup.

07:07.516 --> 07:10.417
She murdered my boy, Leonard.

07:11.821 --> 07:14.312
But...

07:14.390 --> 07:16.790
I gotta think about
Houston's mama.

07:17.893 --> 07:19.827
<i>She blames herself.</i>

07:19.895 --> 07:24.730
She felt sorry for Lila
from the minute
she set eyes on her.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.791
Took her in, kept her on,

07:26.869 --> 07:29.929
when I could see it was leadin'
to nothin' but trouble.

07:30.006 --> 07:34.136
Now, that's why I agreed
to lower the charge
to second-degree murder...

07:34.210 --> 07:37.839
to get this over with
as soon as possible,
for Sadie's sake.

07:37.913 --> 07:40.746
<i>You</i> agreed?
So did you.

07:40.816 --> 07:43.284
Yeah, well,
I-I changed my mind.
Why?

07:43.352 --> 07:45.912
Because she's not guilty.

07:45.988 --> 07:48.479
Leonard, that nigger
murdered my only son.

07:48.557 --> 07:52.357
First of all...
we don't know it was murder.

07:52.428 --> 07:55.261
And second of all,
you can call her black,
colored or Negro,

07:55.331 --> 07:57.492
but don't you ever ca...

07:57.566 --> 08:01.502
Don't you ever use that word
in front of me again.

08:05.574 --> 08:09.567
<i>Well, you never were</i>
<i>much of a lady's man, Leonard.</i>

08:09.645 --> 08:11.636
She rubbin' up
against you, son?

08:11.714 --> 08:15.707
<i>Bendin'over so you can see</i>
<i>down her dress, huh?</i>

08:16.786 --> 08:21.018
I used to watch her
scrubbin' the floors
on her knees,

08:21.090 --> 08:23.115
barefoot,

08:23.192 --> 08:25.558
her skirt hitched up in her belt.

08:27.697 --> 08:29.722
I understand, Leonard.

08:29.799 --> 08:32.164
I truly do.

08:32.234 --> 08:34.225
No, you don't.

08:41.243 --> 08:43.575
What?
You're home.

08:45.481 --> 08:48.177
Oh.
Leonard?

08:49.485 --> 08:53.819
I want you to spend tonight
thinking about what's best
for everybody.

08:53.889 --> 08:56.915
For Sadie,
for your, uh, client...

08:56.992 --> 08:58.892
and for you.

09:02.965 --> 09:05.399
Especially for you, Leonard.

09:09.672 --> 09:12.607
Thanks for the ride,

09:12.675 --> 09:14.666
Captain.

09:18.314 --> 09:21.408
Was that Captain Cotter
I saw dropping you off?

09:21.484 --> 09:24.317
Yeah, I-I guess so.
Oh!

09:24.387 --> 09:26.321
Oh!

09:26.389 --> 09:31.019
The whole town is talkin' about
what you did in court.

09:31.093 --> 09:34.494
Now, I must admit,
when you agreed to defendin'
that colored whore,

09:34.563 --> 09:38.556
which everybody knows
Houston took to his bed
when she was just 14,

09:38.634 --> 09:40.568
I was appalled.

09:40.636 --> 09:45.130
I thought, "Lord help me,
we will never get into
the Twelve Oaks Country Club."

09:46.709 --> 09:49.041
But when I came out
just now...

09:49.111 --> 09:53.343
and saw Captain Cotter
in his new Cadillac,

09:53.416 --> 09:56.385
driving you right up
to our house...

09:56.452 --> 09:58.716
our house...

09:58.788 --> 10:01.586
I said to myself, "Sugee,

10:01.657 --> 10:04.319
we are gonna be famous."

10:06.996 --> 10:09.658
Honey?
Hmm?

10:09.732 --> 10:13.133
I am gonna bake you...

10:13.202 --> 10:15.932
a pecan pie.

10:16.005 --> 10:17.996
Hmm.

10:21.844 --> 10:24.836
And let you play
Rhett Butler tonight.

10:33.756 --> 10:36.486
Fiddle dee dee.
Hmm!

10:48.637 --> 10:51.970
<i>[Sam Narrating]</i>
<i>It was 3:ยก00 in the morning when I finished</i>
<i>reading Leonard's briefs on the trial.</i>

10:52.041 --> 10:53.975
<i>Even then, I couldn't sleep,</i>

10:54.043 --> 10:56.204
<i>partly to avoid Scarlett O'Hara,</i>

10:56.278 --> 10:59.907
<i>but mostly because</i>
<i>I was frightened for anyone</i>
<i>who had me as their lawyer.</i>

10:59.982 --> 11:03.474
<i>All I knew about the law</i>
<i>I got from watching a TVshow...</i>

11:03.552 --> 11:06.043
<i>whose name</i>
<i>I couldn't even remember.</i>

11:06.121 --> 11:08.282
Well, if it isn't Perry Mason!
That's it!

11:08.357 --> 11:11.258
What's it?
Never mind, never mind.
Where have you been?

11:11.327 --> 11:14.490
I've been sitting up
all night with you.
No, I mean with Leonard.

11:14.563 --> 11:16.497
What a wimp.

11:16.565 --> 11:20.228
He spends half the morning
in the fetal position, and it took
another six hours to get him to talk.

11:20.302 --> 11:24.204
What'd he say?
He says, "I'm a lawyer.
Take me to your leader."

11:24.273 --> 11:26.207
That's a terrifying prospect.

11:26.275 --> 11:29.642
The first alien contact on Earth,
and it's a lawyer.

11:29.712 --> 11:31.703
What does Ziggy say?

11:31.780 --> 11:36.342
Uh, well, considering
that Leonard won't talk,
you probably know more than we do.

11:36.418 --> 11:40.320
But best Ziggy could come up with
is you're here to play.

11:40.389 --> 11:43.085
Oh, play Rhett Butler.
No. No way.

11:43.158 --> 11:47.822
Tell Ziggy to shove that.
Listen, I'm here to save Delilah Berry
from the electric chair.

11:47.897 --> 11:50.559
We already ran that scenario.
There's no problem.

11:50.633 --> 11:53.329
No?
No, she pleads guilty
to a lesser charge,

11:53.402 --> 11:56.565
then she gets 20 years
instead of the chair.

11:57.740 --> 12:02.234
Uh... that's probably
before I...

12:02.311 --> 12:05.144
pleaded her not guilty.

12:05.214 --> 12:08.775
What'd you do that for?
'Cause she's not guilty!

12:08.851 --> 12:11.547
Did Lila tell you that?

12:11.620 --> 12:14.919
Well, not in so many words,
but her eyes did.

12:14.990 --> 12:19.154
Al, you wouldn't have believed
the hatred and bigotry
in that courtroom yesterday.

12:19.228 --> 12:21.560
I-I wanted to throw up.
[Sighs]

12:21.630 --> 12:24.565
Women politely referred to her
as a colored whore.
Men just called her a...

12:24.633 --> 12:26.567
All right.
I get the picture.

12:26.635 --> 12:30.196
Look, the point is,
if she really murdered the son
of the most powerful man in this town,

12:30.272 --> 12:32.763
a town where prejudice
is as rampant as it is,

12:32.841 --> 12:35.332
<i>do you really think they'd let her</i>
<i>plea-bargain for her life?</i>

12:35.411 --> 12:39.472
They're hiding something, Al,
and when I find out what it is,
I'm gonna prove Lila's innocent.

12:47.022 --> 12:50.014
<i>[Lila]</i>
<i>I was just getting used to the idea</i>
<i>of spending the rest of my life...</i>

12:50.092 --> 12:52.287
in a prison cell.

Suppose
I'll get used to dying.

12:57.700 --> 13:01.192
I'm here to see that
that doesn't happen.

Chivalry is not dead.

<i>Just waning in the wings.</i>

13:08.277 --> 13:12.304
You know, you...
you shouldn't do that.

13:12.381 --> 13:15.544
What they gonna do?
Shorten my life?

13:20.823 --> 13:24.190
Why did you sign the confession?
[Sighs]
What difference does it make?

13:24.259 --> 13:26.887
Innocent people
don't sign confessions.

13:26.962 --> 13:30.796
I ain't been innocent
since the day I moved
into the captain's house.

13:32.101 --> 13:34.126
I'm Delilah,

13:34.203 --> 13:36.569
the harlot temptress
of the Philistines,

13:36.639 --> 13:39.767
<i>who bewitched the golden boy</i>
<i>of Twelve Oaks...</i>

13:39.842 --> 13:42.504
<i>and murdered him</i>
<i>when he scorned her love.</i>

13:42.578 --> 13:45.843
[Sighs]
I'm lucky they're not
burning me at the stake.

13:47.583 --> 13:50.711
I suppose the electric chair's...

13:52.087 --> 13:54.715
kind of a modern-day stake...

13:54.790 --> 13:56.724
for a modern-day witch.

13:56.792 --> 14:00.592
Lila, you're not a witch
or a murderer.

14:00.663 --> 14:03.257
But I am.

14:03.332 --> 14:06.597
[Chuckles]
I killed Houston.

14:10.005 --> 14:11.939
I killed him.

14:12.007 --> 14:13.998
Lila,

14:14.076 --> 14:19.013
if it was an act of passion
o-or self-defense, I can help you,

14:19.081 --> 14:21.015
but you gotta tell me
what happened.

14:21.083 --> 14:23.847
- I want to go back to my cell now.
- Lila, please.

14:23.919 --> 14:26.149
I killed him, all right?

14:26.221 --> 14:30.214
How many times
you gonna make me say it?
I killed him!

14:30.292 --> 14:32.783
Chigger!
I want out of here.

14:34.396 --> 14:37.832
I was right here, Lila.
No reason to yell.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.391
I know right where you are.

14:40.469 --> 14:42.960
I know right
where everybody is.

14:48.777 --> 14:51.803
<i>[Sheriff]</i>
<i>What do you want to see</i>
<i>her confession for?</i>

14:51.880 --> 14:54.508
Because I'm
her defense attorney.

14:54.583 --> 14:57.313
I want to see everything
pertaining to this case.

14:57.386 --> 15:00.287
I want to see her confession,

15:00.355 --> 15:02.846
the coroner's report,
your investigation...

15:02.925 --> 15:06.656
Oh, Leonard,
we're all really impressed
you wanna do a good job,

15:06.729 --> 15:08.663
but enough's enough.

15:08.731 --> 15:12.724
Not if Lila goes
to the electric chair.
Now, whose fault is that?

15:17.706 --> 15:20.038
I want to see that confession,

15:20.109 --> 15:23.272
the police report,
the coroner's report,

15:23.345 --> 15:25.404
everything on this case.

15:25.481 --> 15:28.075
Now, I don't know
if you have the right
to do that.

15:28.150 --> 15:31.142
I'm her defense counsel!
Of course I have the right.

15:31.220 --> 15:33.211
I have to ask Bo.

15:34.623 --> 15:36.614
I'll wait.

15:43.766 --> 15:45.757
[Sighs]

15:49.104 --> 15:52.005
Never figured you had
this kind of gumption, Leonard.

15:52.074 --> 15:54.565
<i>[Dialing]</i>
Neither did I.

15:57.846 --> 16:00.314
Course, defending a woman
like Lila...

16:00.382 --> 16:02.748
probably gets a man
all "het" up.

16:02.818 --> 16:06.652
Bo! Dix.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

16:06.722 --> 16:10.351
Yeah, Mabel's fixin' a honey ham.
Her mama's gonna bake
a key lime pie.

16:10.425 --> 16:12.359
[Chortling]
Yeah.

16:12.427 --> 16:15.089
Oh, yeah, sure.
Uh, you gonna drive?

16:15.164 --> 16:17.792
I could pick you up
after church.

16:17.866 --> 16:20.858
Uh-huh.
[Wheezing Laugh]
She said that?

16:20.936 --> 16:23.734
Sheriff.
Uh... [Clears Throat]
Bo.

16:23.806 --> 16:28.800
Reason I called is
Leonard is down here.

16:28.877 --> 16:31.539
Yeah.

16:31.613 --> 16:33.877
Yeah, ain't that the truth?

16:33.949 --> 16:37.680
Uh, he wants to see
Lila's confession.

16:37.753 --> 16:41.382
That's what I told him.
Look, you take care.
I'll see you Sunday.

16:41.456 --> 16:43.947
Bo, I'm defending a woman
accused of murder.

16:44.026 --> 16:46.688
Now, if you and Sheriff Lobo
don't start cooperating with me,

16:46.762 --> 16:51.631
I'm gonna get a U.S. district judge
to subpoena your files and charge you both
with obstructing justice!

16:52.634 --> 16:54.625
Uh... Uh-huh.

16:58.006 --> 16:59.997
Uh-huh.

17:00.075 --> 17:02.066
You're the boss.

17:09.617 --> 17:12.609
[Thinking]
Thank you, Perry Mason.

17:13.755 --> 17:17.555
<i>[Sam Narrating]</i>
<i>Lila's confession read like</i>
<i>something out of a soap opera.</i>

17:17.626 --> 17:21.289
<i>If it were true,</i>
<i>she had thrown herself</i>
<i>at Houston for years,</i>

17:21.363 --> 17:25.959
<i>and when he could no longer</i>
<i>tolerate her wild sexual advances,</i>
<i>he dismissed her.</i>

17:26.034 --> 17:29.970
<i>Enraged by the rejection,</i>
<i>she waited for him</i>
<i>to come home that night...</i>

17:30.038 --> 17:32.370
<i>and blew his head off</i>
<i>with a shotgun.</i>

17:32.441 --> 17:36.434
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Leonard Dancey! Is that you?</i>

17:36.511 --> 17:39.878
My, but you have grown.

17:39.948 --> 17:43.349
Well, I haven't seen you since...

17:43.418 --> 17:46.819
you and Houston had that fight
in high school.

17:46.889 --> 17:48.789
Well, it's been a while.

17:48.857 --> 17:52.816
I never thought he was right
with that, Leonard.
I told him so.

17:52.895 --> 17:56.797
Thank you.
<i>I suppose you're here</i>
<i>to see the captain.</i>

17:56.865 --> 18:00.232
Well, no, not exactly.
I'd like to speak with Myrtle.

18:00.302 --> 18:03.294
Myrtle?
Well, why would you want...

18:03.372 --> 18:05.863
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

18:05.941 --> 18:09.775
She's probably sittin' out back
on the summer porch.
Usually does after supper.

18:09.845 --> 18:11.642
Thank you, ma'am.
<i>You take care, now.</i>

18:11.713 --> 18:14.409
Don't you step on my calla lilies
like you used to.

18:14.483 --> 18:17.941
No, ma'am.
<i>They're dyin', Leonard.</i>

18:18.020 --> 18:22.013
This heat...
just killin' every one of'em.

18:22.090 --> 18:24.752
I'm sure they'll come back
just soon as the weather changes.

18:26.395 --> 18:29.592
Sometimes I get a feeling
they're never comin' back.

18:46.415 --> 18:49.509
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>We all appreciate</i>
<i>what you're doin'for Lila.</i>

18:49.584 --> 18:52.052
[Chuckles]

18:52.120 --> 18:54.816
I'm not so sure
most people feel that way.

18:54.890 --> 18:57.381
I said <i>we</i> all do.

19:06.435 --> 19:08.494
Myrtle, uh,

19:08.570 --> 19:13.405
according to the police report,
you're the closest thing we got
to an eyewitness.

19:13.475 --> 19:16.171
- I don't know nothin'.
- But you were here when it happened.

19:16.244 --> 19:19.509
- I was in the kitchen.
- And?

19:21.216 --> 19:26.210
And... Houston came back
from huntin',

19:26.288 --> 19:29.587
and they started fightin' again.

19:29.658 --> 19:32.923
<i>It seems to me</i>
<i>they had been fightin'</i>
<i>most of the day.</i>

19:32.995 --> 19:36.123
- They fought a lot?
- Like possums in heat.

19:36.198 --> 19:38.860
<i>'Bout what?</i>

19:38.934 --> 19:42.893
Well, as usual, she was leavin',
and he didn't want her to go.

19:42.971 --> 19:44.495
She was leaving?

19:44.573 --> 19:47.872
I suppose love
no longer could soften...

19:47.943 --> 19:50.002
the back of his hand.

19:51.980 --> 19:56.110
- She loved him?
- Not at first.

19:56.184 --> 19:58.846
But he took her
when she was 14.

19:58.920 --> 20:01.946
<i>It's funny how the mind...</i>

20:02.024 --> 20:05.425
can turn things around
and make it seem right.

20:05.494 --> 20:07.428
Wait a minute.

20:07.496 --> 20:10.863
He beat and raped her,
and she thought it was love?

20:10.932 --> 20:12.923
It <i>was</i> love.

20:14.669 --> 20:18.571
Least ways, the only kind Lila
ever knew from a man.

20:18.640 --> 20:23.373
Myrtle, this is important.
Did Houston beat Lila
the night that she shot him?

20:23.445 --> 20:27.211
- Now, I don't know. I wasn't in the room.
- Did you hear him beat her?

20:27.282 --> 20:31.878
All I heard was a lot of yelling
a-and things breaking,

20:31.953 --> 20:36.652
and all of a sudden
that gunshot went off,
and Lila screamed.

20:36.725 --> 20:40.126
<i>And then Lila opened the door,</i>

20:40.195 --> 20:43.221
<i>and there was Houston.</i>

20:43.298 --> 20:46.233
He was laying on Miss Sadie's...

20:46.301 --> 20:49.429
imported rug...

20:50.439 --> 20:52.430
with no face.

20:52.507 --> 20:54.498
Oh, my God.

20:56.445 --> 20:58.936
[Sobbing]
He had no face!

21:15.197 --> 21:17.188
Your telling me this...

21:17.265 --> 21:21.326
it means that Lila shot Houston
in self-defense or by accident,

21:21.403 --> 21:23.337
but without premeditation.

21:23.405 --> 21:27.774
When a jury hears that,
there's no way they can send her
to the electric chair.

21:27.843 --> 21:31.335
I can't be no witness.

21:31.413 --> 21:33.404
What?

21:34.549 --> 21:36.881
I can't swear on no Bible!

21:36.952 --> 21:39.546
Who are you afraid of,
the captain?

21:39.621 --> 21:42.181
I'm not afraid of any man,

21:42.257 --> 21:44.953
white nor colored.

21:45.026 --> 21:47.688
Then why won't you testify?
Lila's life depends on it.

21:47.762 --> 21:50.754
I can't be no witness.

21:53.135 --> 21:55.126
Myrtle.

21:57.539 --> 22:00.235
<i>[Gavel Rapping]</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>All rise.</i>

22:00.308 --> 22:02.538
Twelve Oaks Parish Court
is now in session.

22:02.611 --> 22:05.273
I know what happened
between you and Houston.

22:05.347 --> 22:07.508
<i>[Judge]</i>
<i>Be seated.</i>

22:12.154 --> 22:15.715
Myrtle told me.
He was beating you that night,
wasn't he?

22:17.392 --> 22:20.418
Lila, I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

22:20.495 --> 22:24.431
- Is the prosecution ready?
- We are, Your Honor.

22:24.499 --> 22:26.797
Leonard?

22:36.311 --> 22:38.802
[Thinking]
Oh, God. Help me.

22:47.689 --> 22:51.420
Leonard,
is the defense ready?

22:51.493 --> 22:54.291
- No.
- [Excited Chattering]

22:56.798 --> 23:00.529
- No?
- I can't go on.

23:01.603 --> 23:04.572
- Yes, you can, Sam.
- Al!

23:04.639 --> 23:09.599
- Al?
- Ask if you can approach the bench.

23:09.678 --> 23:11.976
I'd like to approach the bench.
Your Honor.

23:13.381 --> 23:15.713
Both counsels
may approach the bench.

23:22.724 --> 23:25.659
Now, ask Your, uh,
Your Worship here...

23:25.727 --> 23:28.355
if you can have a few minutes
alone in his chambers.

23:28.430 --> 23:30.921
Your Worship...
Uh, Your Honor,

23:30.999 --> 23:33.593
I'd like to use your chambers
for a few minutes.

23:33.668 --> 23:37.434
We can talk here, Leonard.
Oh, no. I mean alone.

23:37.505 --> 23:39.905
Alone?
Well...

23:39.975 --> 23:42.967
Tell him your fly's open.
My fly's open?
My fly's open.

23:43.044 --> 23:47.037
Your zipper's stuck.
My zipper's stuck, and I need
a few minutes in private to fix it.

23:47.115 --> 23:50.016
I object!
[Chuckles]

23:50.085 --> 23:54.146
You can't expect
a man to plead a case
with his fly open, Bo.

23:55.957 --> 23:58.448
[Sighs]
You have three minutes,
Leonard.

23:58.526 --> 24:00.824
I trust it'll be enough.

24:00.895 --> 24:03.728
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Your Honor.

24:03.798 --> 24:05.789
Your Honor.

24:24.486 --> 24:27.421
Boy, am I glad to see you.

24:27.489 --> 24:29.480
Thought you might be.

24:29.557 --> 24:31.548
Al.

24:33.128 --> 24:35.392
Am I a lawyer?
Was I a lawyer?

24:35.463 --> 24:39.194
No. Not one of your six degrees
was in the law.

24:39.267 --> 24:41.326
But don't worry, Sam.

24:41.403 --> 24:45.635
Ziggy and I have got
the entire history of law
right here under my fingertips.

24:45.707 --> 24:50.542
This is not a computer game!
Lila's life is on the line,
and... it's my fault.

24:52.847 --> 24:57.341
Oh. I thought so too,
but then I remembered
what you said about her eyes.

24:58.953 --> 25:01.012
'Bout losing myself in them?

25:01.089 --> 25:03.785
Well, no.
Me, maybe. You, never.

25:03.858 --> 25:05.849
But you saw the truth there.

25:05.927 --> 25:09.829
That's probably why
you got this job.
<i>[Knocking]</i>

25:09.898 --> 25:13.561
Uh, yeah.
Uh, I'll be right out.

25:14.869 --> 25:17.497
So... you really think
we can save her?

25:17.572 --> 25:19.597
Of course we can save her.

25:19.674 --> 25:22.837
Ziggy and I have researched
a dozen similar cases to this,

25:22.911 --> 25:25.937
and we're gonna mount
a hell of a defense,
starting with the jury.

25:26.014 --> 25:27.948
Okay.

25:29.017 --> 25:30.951
The jury?

25:31.019 --> 25:33.988
<i>[Judge]</i>
<i>What is wrong with thejury?</i>

25:34.055 --> 25:37.183
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>None of them are black.</i>
<i>You mean Negro?</i>

25:37.258 --> 25:39.385
<i>Uh, yes, sir.</i>

25:39.461 --> 25:41.520
<i>And since my client...</i>

25:41.596 --> 25:45.362
is... a Negro,

25:45.433 --> 25:49.062
it only seems fair
that there be Negroes
on the jury.

25:49.137 --> 25:51.071
I object.

25:51.139 --> 25:55.906
There's never been a Negro
impaneled on a jury in Louisiana.

25:55.977 --> 25:57.706
Overruled.

25:57.779 --> 26:00.043
I told you so, Sam.

26:00.115 --> 26:04.484
- <i>Leonard, there's only one problem.</i>
- Uh-oh.

26:04.552 --> 26:09.251
In order to serve on a jury,
you have to be a registered voter.

26:09.324 --> 26:12.919
And since there aren't
any Negroes...

26:12.994 --> 26:16.122
<i>registered in this parish,</i>

26:16.197 --> 26:19.564
<i>I just don't see how you're</i>
<i>gonna put one on thatjury.</i>

26:22.404 --> 26:25.464
Well,
[Device Squealing]

26:25.540 --> 26:28.031
that being the case,
Your Honor,

26:30.545 --> 26:35.039
since the law requires
a trial by jury of one's peers,

26:35.116 --> 26:37.744
we have no choice but to...

26:37.819 --> 26:40.845
reluctantly accept
these white jurors...

26:40.922 --> 26:42.913
as Lila's equals.

26:42.991 --> 26:45.118
<i>[Spectators Gasping]</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>What? Equals?</i>

26:52.100 --> 26:55.263
Sam, that was beautiful!

26:55.336 --> 26:59.670
<i>The pellets entered the back</i>
<i>of Houston's head about, uh, here.</i>

26:59.741 --> 27:03.802
The entry wound was approximately
three inches in diameter.

27:03.878 --> 27:06.210
And the exit wound?
Blew his face off.

27:08.583 --> 27:12.178
<i>[Sam Narrating]</i>
<i>Bo's case was coming together</i>
<i>like a carefully orchestrated play.</i>

27:12.253 --> 27:15.916
<i>Everyone was telling the same story,</i>
<i>using the same words.</i>

27:15.990 --> 27:18.959
<i>Trouble is, not much of the story</i>
<i>resembled Myrtle's.</i>

27:19.027 --> 27:21.860
<i>It was as if they had seen</i>
<i>the same play...</i>

27:21.930 --> 27:24.023
<i>put on by a different director.</i>

27:24.098 --> 27:26.589
<i>[Witness]</i>
<i>After a while, when I touched</i>
<i>his shoulder</i>...

27:26.668 --> 27:28.659
<i>[Bo]</i>
<i>Is that the confession?</i>

27:28.736 --> 27:31.899
Mmm, yes, sir.
I recognize that signature.

27:31.973 --> 27:35.340
And, uh, if you'll notice,
the letter "R" is crooked.

27:35.410 --> 27:38.811
I can't get the town council
to authorize fixin' that typewriter.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.678
<i>[Spectators Laughing]</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>That's tellin' 'em, Sheriff.</i>

27:41.749 --> 27:45.549
Your Honor, I'd like to have this
entered into the record...

27:45.620 --> 27:49.249
as Exhibit "B"
for the prosecution...

27:49.324 --> 27:51.554
and read into the record.

27:51.626 --> 27:54.561
Object. Object! Object!
Uh, I object.

27:54.629 --> 27:58.156
On what grounds?
It was obtained under duress.

27:58.233 --> 28:01.031
Miss Berry
signed that confession
under duress.

28:01.102 --> 28:05.198
- Is that true, Lila?
- <i>He can't ask her anything</i>
<i>until she's placed</i>...

28:05.273 --> 28:07.264
[Both]
Under oath.
<i>[Bo] What?</i>

28:07.342 --> 28:11.244
Uh, Your Honor,
my client can't be questioned
unless she's under oath.

28:11.312 --> 28:13.439
Well, then swear her in.

28:13.515 --> 28:16.348
I ain't swearin' on no Bible.

28:16.417 --> 28:18.351
Lila, you have to.

28:18.419 --> 28:21.752
I ain't takin' no oath,
and I ain't gettin' on
no witness stand.

28:25.527 --> 28:29.520
Sam, at least have her read it
and make sure that it's her words
and her signature.

28:29.597 --> 28:33.431
Your Honor, I think we

Miss Berry take the stand,

28:50.385 --> 28:53.013
Looks like it.

28:53.087 --> 28:56.079
Well... just read it to be sure.

28:58.793 --> 29:00.727
I can't.

29:00.795 --> 29:03.958
What do you mean,
you can't?

29:04.032 --> 29:06.023

<i>We were great, Sam!</i>
<i>We knocked their socks off.</i>

29:14.442 --> 29:17.240
We did nothing.
Nothing?
What do you mean, nothing?

29:17.312 --> 29:20.475
We got the judge to delay
his ruling on the confession...

29:20.548 --> 29:22.539
until after lunch.

29:22.617 --> 29:26.348
If Lila doesn't get on the stand

I have honey-coated chicken...

29:29.857 --> 29:33.850

I have never been so mortified
in my entire life!

29:38.032 --> 29:40.262
If Papa were alive, he'd die.

29:40.335 --> 29:43.930
How could you say
that colored whore
was equal to a white person?

29:44.005 --> 29:46.997
Her name is Lila
or Miss Berry,

29:47.075 --> 29:50.238
and you will refer to her as that
in my presence,

29:50.311 --> 29:52.939
and even if you're not
in my presence.

29:53.014 --> 29:56.472
Leonard Dancey,
have you taken leave
of your senses?

29:56.551 --> 29:59.179
Why, I'm not saying anything
that you haven't said.

30:01.623 --> 30:04.456
Well, I was wrong.

30:07.161 --> 30:10.028
What are you doing?
Taking Lila some lunch.

30:10.098 --> 30:12.362
You are going to give
that colored...

30:13.935 --> 30:16.495

30:16.571 --> 30:20.564
- If she'll have it.
- Well, well, well, Miss Sugee.

30:20.642 --> 30:23.202
Oh!
Look at you.

30:23.277 --> 30:26.440
I swear, Leonard,
your little lady is like
the fruit in the tree.

30:26.514 --> 30:31.508
She just gets sweeter with time.
Oh, Captain Cotter,
you are such a flirt!

30:31.586 --> 30:35.579
That was quite a show
you put on there, Leonard.

30:35.657 --> 30:37.591
Mmm!
Mmm.

30:37.659 --> 30:39.593
I was very impressed.

30:39.661 --> 30:42.323
Shame to see talent like that
leave Twelve Oaks.

30:42.397 --> 30:45.230
Oh, well, we aren't
goin' anywhere, Captain.

30:45.299 --> 30:49.235
Oh! Why, I didn't realize
you all had enough money to retire.

30:49.303 --> 30:52.238
Why don't you
get to the point, Captain?
Leonard.

30:52.306 --> 30:54.501
All right, Leonard, I will.

30:54.575 --> 30:58.807
Now, most of the legal work
done in this parish is done
for me or for my associates.

30:58.880 --> 31:02.816
Now, if you persist
in pursuing this course of action,

31:02.884 --> 31:07.253
the only legal work
you gonna do, son,
is gonna be pro bono.

31:10.558 --> 31:13.755
That means for free, Sugee.
Mmm, my, my.

Some would say so.
Some not.

So I let him.

32:23.297 --> 32:25.288
Is that rape?

32:25.366 --> 32:27.300
Yes.

32:27.368 --> 32:30.804
Well, if it was,
it was only that first time.

32:30.872 --> 32:32.999
After that,

32:33.074 --> 32:35.474
Houston was in love with me.

32:35.543 --> 32:38.341
That doesn't make
what he did to you right.

32:38.412 --> 32:42.041
There ain't a whole lot in this world
that is right, Leonard.

32:46.654 --> 32:48.986
Looks like the picnic's over.

32:50.958 --> 32:52.949
Lila,

32:54.695 --> 32:56.629
you have got to deny
this confession.

32:56.697 --> 32:59.928
I ain't gettin' on no witness stand.
It's gonna send you
to the electric chair!

33:00.001 --> 33:02.060
Do you understand what it says?

33:02.136 --> 33:05.833
That Houston put up
with your sexual advances
until they became intolerable to him,

33:05.907 --> 33:09.138
that he fired you, and because of that
you waited for him that night
in the parlor with a shotgun,

33:09.210 --> 33:12.145
and although he begged you
in the name ofJesus not to shoot him...

33:12.213 --> 33:15.671
In the name ofJesus?
How can they say he did that?

33:15.750 --> 33:18.583
They can say it
because you won't defend yourself.

33:19.620 --> 33:21.611
But it's a lie.

33:24.225 --> 33:26.159
It's a lie.

It's all a lie, isn't it?

<i>strike her in front of me...</i>

41:47.261 --> 41:49.559
until that night.

41:56.403 --> 41:59.395
Tell us about that night,
Mrs. Cotter.

42:03.210 --> 42:05.770
<i>It was my fault.</i>

42:05.846 --> 42:11.079
I gave Lila the money
so she could get away, start a new life.

42:12.186 --> 42:15.121
She and I were dawdlin'
over our good-byes...

42:15.189 --> 42:17.384
when Houston came home
from huntin'.

42:19.259 --> 42:21.454
<i>He saw that valise in her hand,</i>

42:21.528 --> 42:24.019
and he threw it
clean across the room.

42:25.032 --> 42:28.297
Broke that big Chinese vase
the captain brought back from England.

42:30.504 --> 42:33.496
That's when Lila slapped him.

42:34.708 --> 42:37.472
Oh, Houston went wild.

42:37.544 --> 42:40.911
He hit her so hard,
she fell into the chifforobe.

42:41.915 --> 42:45.282
I tried to stop him,
but he pushed <i>me</i> away.

42:46.353 --> 42:48.548
<i>Just kept hittin'her</i>
<i>over and over.</i>

42:48.622 --> 42:52.615
I begged for him to stop
before he killed her,

42:54.027 --> 42:56.018
but he wouldn't.

42:58.799 --> 43:01.734
That's when I picked up
the shotgun.

43:01.802 --> 43:04.965
- [Spectators Gasping, Murmuring]
- It was an accident!

43:05.038 --> 43:06.972
<i>[Judge]</i>
<i>Order! Order!</i>

43:07.040 --> 43:10.476
<i>[Sadie]</i>
<i>It was so loud, made my ears ring.</i>

43:10.544 --> 43:13.741
And then Lila started screamin'.

43:13.814 --> 43:16.578
Lord, child, can you scream.

43:16.650 --> 43:19.016
It was an accident.

43:19.086 --> 43:21.577
<i>She was tryin'</i>
<i>to save my life.</i>

43:21.655 --> 43:25.751
All she was tryin' to do
was save my life.

43:25.826 --> 43:27.953
So you see, Eugene,

43:28.028 --> 43:31.623
<i>Lila didn't steal the money</i>...
<i>I gave it to her.</i>

43:31.698 --> 43:35.634
And I'll see that Houston
tells you the truth of that,

43:35.702 --> 43:38.637
soon as he comes home
from huntin'.

44:14.741 --> 44:17.005
Hello.
Mr. Dancey.

44:17.077 --> 44:20.376
What you doin' out here?
I came by to see you off.

44:20.447 --> 44:23.348
You don't have to worry about me.
Not anymore.

44:24.718 --> 44:26.686
Well, I've kinda gotten used to it.

44:26.753 --> 44:28.687
Where you goin'?

44:28.755 --> 44:31.519
Wherever a hundred dollars
will take me.

44:31.592 --> 44:35.494
I heard you got a story and your picture
in the Baton Rouge paper.

44:35.562 --> 44:38.656
Yeah, and an offer
from a very big law firm there.

44:38.732 --> 44:41.132
Well, what does Miss Sugee
think of that?

44:41.201 --> 44:44.637
Well, a country club membership
comes along with the job.

44:44.705 --> 44:47.105
[Laughing]
She would take to that.

44:48.342 --> 44:50.276
Lila...

44:50.344 --> 44:52.278
what are you going to do?

44:52.346 --> 44:55.110
It doesn't matter.

44:55.182 --> 44:57.173
I'm free.

44:58.185 --> 45:00.244
Miss Sadie saved my life.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.311
Twice.

45:03.757 --> 45:05.952
I hope she never remembers
what happened.

45:07.594 --> 45:09.585
So do I.

45:10.964 --> 45:12.898
Well...
[Sighs]

45:12.966 --> 45:15.901
Oh, I intend to send you some money
as soon as I get a job.

45:15.969 --> 45:19.405
Now, it may not be much,
but I'll keep sendin' it
until you tell me it's enough.

45:19.473 --> 45:22.408
Although,
Lord knows, whatever it is
it'll never be enough.

45:22.476 --> 45:25.411
I don't want you
to send me anything.
But I gotta pay you.

45:25.479 --> 45:27.470
Just make me a promise.

45:27.548 --> 45:30.108
What is it?
It's a reader.

45:32.419 --> 45:35.479
If you want to pay me back,
learn how to read.

45:35.556 --> 45:39.754
Lila, if you can read,
you can do anything you want.

45:57.144 --> 45:59.135
Good-bye.

46:06.186 --> 46:08.347
Oh. Uh...

46:11.491 --> 46:13.982
- Promise?
- Promise.

46:14.061 --> 46:16.222
So help me God.

46:28.742 --> 46:31.677
<i>(music) [Overture: ยกDramatic]</i>

46:31.745 --> 46:33.645
One minute! Places!

46:33.714 --> 46:36.444
Stop screaming!
I am not screaming!

46:36.516 --> 46:39.212
He is on in 50 seconds!

46:39.286 --> 46:41.584
O-On? What...

46:41.655 --> 46:43.589
Forty-seven!

46:43.657 --> 46:47.093
Don't do this, Charlie!
We're not launching any rockets!
It's just a musical!

46:47.160 --> 46:49.094
Forty-eight!

46:49.162 --> 46:51.357
Break a leg, Ray!

46:52.432 --> 46:55.697
Four, three, two, one.
