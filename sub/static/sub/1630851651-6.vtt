WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:08.884
How long are you gonna keep me here?

00:08.967 --> 00:10.594
Only forever.

00:13.305 --> 00:15.182
Are we gonna be here all day?

00:15.265 --> 00:18.769
My haircuts only take ten minutes
when Dad does it.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.730
Didn't we just spend two hours
at Kickity Kicks where someone

00:21.813 --> 00:23.857
had to try on every pair of sneakers?

00:23.941 --> 00:26.443
Yeah, but that was fun.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.655
Sweetheart,
you're gonna hurt Valerie's feelings.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.865
Why don't you flip through some magazines?

00:31.949 --> 00:34.159
Cause they're, like, a hundred years old.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.662
He's not wrong.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.748
We did just get a new vending machine
in the back.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.501
Mom. Please?

00:44.545 --> 00:45.963
Healthy snacks only.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.717
-Bring me back my change.
-You're not getting your change back.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.511
No, I'm not. Yeah. No.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.354
Hey, sweetie.
The bathroom is just the next door over.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.815
Are you okay?

01:05.399 --> 01:09.194
Uh-huh. Yeah, great. Really great.

01:10.529 --> 01:13.740
-Okay.
-I just found out I'm leaving tomorrow

01:13.824 --> 01:16.326
on a world tour
as a celebrity personal stylist.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.161
It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.582
That doesn't sound like
something to be crying about.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.709
I know. It's wonderful. But…

01:24.877 --> 01:27.379
it's Princess. I can't take her with me.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.632
She hates flying, and
I'd be dragging her all over the world.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.301
She'd be absolutely miserable.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.428
So what are you gonna do?

01:34.511 --> 01:35.596
My sister.

01:36.096 --> 01:40.392
She's gonna take her. But she has cats,
so Princess has to live in the garage.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.020
And her husband's always working on
his motorcycles,

01:43.103 --> 01:46.732
and he's revving the engines,
and Princess has sensitive eardrums.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.358
It's not ideal.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.237
But it is a home.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.532
I think I can help you.

02:06.043 --> 02:09.253
I know you didn't find that
in the vending machine.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.673
This is Princess, our new foster puppy.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.760
Your son is my hero.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.138
He said he was gonna
help find Princess a new home.

02:18.222 --> 02:19.223
Charles?

02:19.306 --> 02:23.227
What happened to asking Dad and me
before offering to take in a new dog?

02:23.310 --> 02:25.562
But Princess really needs us.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.607
I know that it's a lot to ask.
But I promise,

02:28.690 --> 02:32.402
once you get to know Princess,
she is such a love.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.326
She just has a few particulars.

02:39.993 --> 02:44.331
She said a few particulars.
This is ten pages of rules.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.418
"Must be sung a lullaby
in order to fall asleep."

02:48.502 --> 02:51.922
What puppy only
drinks French bottled water?

02:52.005 --> 02:56.426
And needs to be brushed…
a hundred times a day?

02:56.510 --> 02:59.179
Well,
of course a princess has royal decrees.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.682
But I bet they're worth it.

03:01.765 --> 03:05.394
-She's so cute.
-Looks like you two have your hands full.

03:05.477 --> 03:08.438
Well, actually, Charles,
I'll help you when I can,

03:08.522 --> 03:11.775
but Maria and I have
a huge ancient civilizations project

03:11.859 --> 03:13.986
that we're gonna be working on all week.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.279
So…

03:15.362 --> 03:17.447
It's okay. I can do it.

03:18.115 --> 03:22.536
Thanks. And don't worry, Princess.
I'll sneak in a snuggle once in a while.

03:24.580 --> 03:28.500
It says that she only
wants to be picked up

03:28.584 --> 03:31.587
with a gentle scooping motion.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.965
Okay. Well, you got this, Charles.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.551
Okay.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.223
Yeah. I know.
Mid-afternoon snack. I'll be right back.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.521
-Did you get the poster boards?
-Check. I also got rainbow glitter.

03:49.605 --> 03:53.108
-Did you sort out our schedule?
-Check. I even carved out break time

03:53.192 --> 03:55.694
to work on my Aunt Linda's
30-minute cookie recipe.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.780
I found a 20-minute recipe
so we can get back to work even faster.

03:58.864 --> 04:03.327
Amazing. Maria, we are so mentally
and emotionally prepared for this project.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.411
Once we ace it,

04:04.494 --> 04:07.247
we're pretty much guaranteed two spots
in Advanced History.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.499
Okay, class.

04:09.583 --> 04:14.171
I've finished the list of partners
for the ancient civilizations project.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.757
Wesley, you'll be paired with Harper.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.220
Maria, you'll be paired with…

04:22.596 --> 04:24.264
Thao.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.934
-Heather and Linda, you'll be together.
-What?

04:27.017 --> 04:29.645
We've been partners
on every project this year.

04:29.728 --> 04:33.065
-I hope I can return the glitter.
-And finally, Lizzie…

04:34.066 --> 04:37.027
you'll be paired with Julie.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.947
Okay.
Let's take the last five minutes of class

04:40.030 --> 04:42.491
to get together
and talk about your projects.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.285
I got Judo Julie?

04:45.369 --> 04:48.747
This must be some sort of mistake.
Come on.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.626
Ladies?

04:52.709 --> 04:56.880
Ms. Newman, I can't even begin
to imagine how busy you must be.

04:56.964 --> 05:00.843
I mean, teaching all day,
grading homework all night.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.637
Keeping so many students' names straight.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.138
Look.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.308
I know you wanted to be partners again.

05:08.892 --> 05:12.938
But I thought you both might benefit
from mixing it up.

05:13.730 --> 05:17.359
Hey, Maria. Can I walk you through
some of the ideas I have?

05:17.442 --> 05:20.237
They're color coded
by century and culture.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.614
Wow, definitely.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.158
I mean, sure.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.790
Hey, JJ. So, I think Cleopatra
could be a really great topic--

05:31.874 --> 05:33.542
Sorry, Lizzie. I gotta run.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.628
-I have practice after school every day.
-Every day?

05:36.712 --> 05:39.464
Yeah. But my mom can drop me
at your house after

05:39.548 --> 05:41.175
and we can work then. Cool?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.848
She's portable. That's good.

05:47.931 --> 05:51.435
And she doesn't shed.
My mom will like that.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.104
But I don't think we're a match.

05:54.188 --> 05:57.482
She seems too elegant,
and I'm a man of the people.

05:57.566 --> 06:01.111
It's okay, Remy.
I knew this wouldn't be easy.

06:01.195 --> 06:04.323
Princess,
why can't you act like a normal dog?

06:04.907 --> 06:07.075
Really? She can't be that bad.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.746
Here's your food, Princess,

06:10.829 --> 06:13.832
warmed up in your special bowl
just the way you like it.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.419
See? She caught me.
I didn't mash it up enough.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.464
You really think
she'll know the difference?

06:23.175 --> 06:26.887
Seriously?
I might have underestimated her.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.932
I know you're thirsty.

06:31.099 --> 06:35.020
-So which one's the special French water?
-Neither.

06:37.648 --> 06:39.900
-She's good.
-Told you.

06:41.443 --> 06:46.323
Ninety-six, 97, 98, 99…

06:47.658 --> 06:49.117
That's my mom. I gotta go.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.916
100.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.627
Princess, you're a worthy adversary.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.420
Charles.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.763
I'm worried about Princess.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.181
Did something happen?

07:11.265 --> 07:14.142
No, I'm just worried
that no one's gonna want her.

07:14.226 --> 07:17.145
She's a lot of work
for such a little dog, huh?

07:17.229 --> 07:18.272
Yeah.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.108
Charles, I am not going to lie to you.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.443
A lot of people
won't want to adopt Princess.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.737
-So how am I gonna find the right--
-But…

07:25.821 --> 07:29.283
-there are just as many people who will.
-Really?

07:29.366 --> 07:31.952
You know why Princess is the way she is?

07:32.035 --> 07:35.289
It's because
Angela loved to spoil and pamper her.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.041
So all you have to do
is find another Angela.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.170
Wait. You just gave me a great idea.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.547
I did? See, I love when I do that.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.675
I think I know where to find
the perfect person.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.469
-Thanks, Dad.
-I always got you. Hey.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.934
You know, your mom's not home
for another hour.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.353
-Shark Chronicles?
-Yeah.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.445
I have to take Princess
on her after-dinner walk.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.655
It helps with her digestion.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.033
Okay.

08:17.206 --> 08:18.207
Okay.

08:18.290 --> 08:22.836
JJ, we only have four days to do this,
so we should get to work.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.129
I'm working.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.089
I'm thinking.

08:27.132 --> 08:31.220
Right. Okay, well, we should at least
start taking some notes.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.514
Sorry. Gotta stretch.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.308
I thought you were supposed to
stretch before judo.

08:37.392 --> 08:41.020
And after. It helps with recovery.
It's part of my daily routine.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.315
Wake up, smoothie, school, stretch,

08:43.398 --> 08:46.944
practice, snack, stretch,
dinner, push-ups, sleep, repeat.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.363
-Well, what about homework?
-I fit it in.

08:50.656 --> 08:53.534
Well, you know, I'm a big planner too.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.078
I've made a schedule
to keep us both on track.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.789
We spend an hour each night
on the oral presentation

08:58.872 --> 09:01.208
and an hour doing research
for the written part.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.960
I don't think I'll need all that.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.547
-JJ, your dad is here.
-Thanks, Mrs. Peterson.

09:07.339 --> 09:11.009
JJ, this project
is really important to me.

09:11.093 --> 09:13.220
Lizzie, I'm a good student too.

09:13.929 --> 09:16.723
You don't have to worry.
See you tomorrow. Cool?

09:23.730 --> 09:26.316
I mean, at my first regional championship
I was six,

09:26.400 --> 09:29.111
and I was competing against
a bunch of eight-year-olds.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.530
My coach was really there for me.

09:31.613 --> 09:32.614
Go ahead.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.117
Hey, BFF. What ya building?

09:35.200 --> 09:38.829
Thao came up with schematics for
a to-scale model of the Roman Colosseum.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.291
And Maria had the great idea
of upcycling Popsicle sticks.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.458
Awesome.

09:45.586 --> 09:48.797
It looks like you could use
some more support in the Doric column.

09:48.881 --> 09:53.010
We know, but those are Ionic columns.
The Dorics are on the bottom.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.178
Right.

09:55.554 --> 09:59.892
I know. You could use soda can tabs
as little miniature gladiators.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.561
Good idea.
But we're actually using paper clips.

10:02.644 --> 10:05.856
It's easier to make little arms
to hold miniature shields.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.400
Yeah, you're right.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.319
That is better.

10:10.402 --> 10:13.280
Hey, Thao.
Could you give me and Lizzie a second?

10:13.363 --> 10:15.574
Sure. I'll go wash off this glue.

10:17.326 --> 10:20.370
-It's not going well with JJ?
-It's not going, period.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.122
We're supposed to be working now,

10:22.206 --> 10:25.918
but she's getting interviewed by
the school newspaper about her judo stuff.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.713
I'm gonna have to do
this entire project by myself.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.965
I really wish I could do it with you.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.676
I think her interview's over.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.095
If you don't wanna work with me,
that's fine.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.973
-JJ, I didn't mean it.
-Yeah, you did, Lizzie.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.310
Just finish your part of the project,
and I'll do mine.

10:43.393 --> 10:47.606
-JJ, can we at least just talk--
-Don't have time. I have judo.

10:52.069 --> 10:53.612
What are you gonna do now?

10:54.488 --> 10:55.489
I don't know.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.659
-Ready to go?
-Yep.

10:58.742 --> 11:02.454
Princess, you're gonna get
all the attention you could dream of.

11:02.538 --> 11:03.622
Too bad.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.501
I was looking forward to
borrowing her luggage. Come on.

11:14.424 --> 11:18.971
Excuse me. Hi.
My son, Charles, has something to say.

11:20.931 --> 11:24.977
As some of you may know,
I'm trying to find Princess a great home.

11:25.060 --> 11:28.730
She loves being brushed
and massaged and stuff like that.

11:29.523 --> 11:33.610
I brought adoption applications.
They're really easy to fill out.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.736
No.

11:34.820 --> 11:39.157
Please? I know all of you
are really good at pampering,

11:39.241 --> 11:40.993
and you must love doing it.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.786
That's why you work here.

11:45.455 --> 11:48.709
-Can I say hello? I love Yorkies.
-You do?

11:48.792 --> 11:52.629
My grandparents had two when I was a kid.
Shirley and Mr. Kincaid.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.382
All they ever wanted to do
was play and give kisses.

11:56.592 --> 11:59.803
Not this one, Len.
She's got a list of rules a mile long.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.973
And if you don't follow 'em,
you're in for a lot of trouble.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.184
I love Angela,
but she raised a prima donna.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.977
But she looks so sweet.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.898
She is sweet,
as long as you stick to her routine.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.692
Angela would floss her teeth,
paint her toes--

12:13.775 --> 12:16.153
I heard she only eats
if you invite her to dinner.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.654
That's not true.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.992
-But the other stuff is.
-Maybe I spoke too soon.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.160
Sorry, buddy.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.954
It's okay. I understand.

12:26.038 --> 12:27.164
Sorry.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.794
Sweetie, you did your best.

12:32.878 --> 12:35.464
Don't worry.
You'll find her a perfect home.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.548
How do you know?

12:36.632 --> 12:40.511
If Angela's friends think she's too picky,
I don't know who's gonna want her.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.805
You know, I once knew a picky kid

12:43.889 --> 12:46.934
who would only eat grilled cheese
if I cut off the crust.

12:47.017 --> 12:50.812
Then he'd use it as a barrier to keep
the carrots from touching the sandwich.

12:50.896 --> 12:53.315
I thought it tastes better that way.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.068
Besides,
I was just a little kid back then.

12:56.652 --> 13:00.489
My point is we all have things
we like done in a particular way.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.698
And you know what?

13:01.782 --> 13:05.536
I loved cutting off the crust
because of how happy it made you.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.164
-You see where I'm going with this?
-Yeah.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.709
There is someone out there for Princess.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.628
But who?

13:18.131 --> 13:20.384
Bet those taste as good as they smell.

13:21.385 --> 13:22.928
You'll have to ask JJ.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.765
This is an "I'm sorry" batch
of Aunt Linda's cookies I baked for her.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.141
So you two made up.

13:28.225 --> 13:32.187
Well, not really. I called her 15 times
until she eventually answered,

13:32.271 --> 13:33.939
and I begged her to come over.

13:35.524 --> 13:38.694
Look, I feel really bad
for hurting her feelings.

13:40.028 --> 13:43.949
-Hopefully, these make up for it.
-We all make mistakes, honey.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.285
I'm proud of you for trying to fix it,

13:46.368 --> 13:49.288
and cookies are a great way
to anyone's heart.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.874
And mind.
I added walnuts for extra brainpower.

13:51.957 --> 13:54.793
I'm gonna need it to finish
this Cleopatra project in time.

13:55.419 --> 13:56.837
Walnuts.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.505
Dad!

14:00.465 --> 14:01.675
Hi, JJ.

14:03.594 --> 14:06.305
Hey, JJ. I'm excited to work together.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.641
I made us study cookies.

14:09.725 --> 14:12.853
And if you need to stretch or whatever,
that's totally cool.

14:12.936 --> 14:16.523
I'll just keep working.
Does that sound good?

14:16.607 --> 14:17.816
I guess.

14:18.775 --> 14:22.112
But I'm not doing cookies
till after my tournament this weekend.

14:23.197 --> 14:24.198
Okay.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.866
But I appreciate it.

14:31.830 --> 14:36.710
Fifty-six, 57, 58…

14:38.170 --> 14:41.006
Hey, Remy.
I didn't know you were coming over.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.008
I heard Lizzie was working with JJ,

14:43.091 --> 14:45.511
so I thought I'd drop by
and get a few pointers.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.304
Okay.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.934
You're not making fun of my judogi.
You okay?

14:52.017 --> 14:56.480
Not really.
What if I never find a home for Princess?

14:56.563 --> 15:00.192
I guess you'll have to keep her
and be her servant forever.

15:02.986 --> 15:06.949
I'm ready for my lunch.
And don't forget to cut off the crusts.

15:07.032 --> 15:10.953
-What? Your food doesn't even have crusts.
-Off with the crusts!

15:12.037 --> 15:14.706
I took off the crust for old times' sake.

15:14.790 --> 15:18.085
Remy, I can make you one too.
Crust or no crust?

15:18.168 --> 15:22.631
Thanks, Mrs. P. Crust, please.
Do you have any tomato soup?

15:23.924 --> 15:25.884
-It's a great combo.
-You got it.

15:26.468 --> 15:30.556
I need to finish brushing Princess
before she gets upset.

15:30.639 --> 15:34.518
I think Princess will be fine, Charles.
I'll trade ya.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.360
I'll add "Cleopatra: Warrior Queen"
somewhere up here.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.904
And I'll put some pictures
in these empty spaces.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.406
Looks pretty good.

15:49.283 --> 15:50.284
Sorry.

15:50.868 --> 15:55.038
No, it's okay. Go ahead.
I'll keep working on the board.

15:55.122 --> 16:00.085
Actually, I finished my stretches
early today so I could do this.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.968
Wait, you wrote this whole paper?

16:08.802 --> 16:12.097
-When did you have the time?
-I finished this afternoon.

16:12.598 --> 16:14.224
It came to me pretty quickly

16:14.308 --> 16:17.728
when I imagined
what it must've been like to be Cleopatra.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.189
So I wrote it from her perspective.

16:21.440 --> 16:25.485
She was so young.
Like, not that much older than us.

16:25.569 --> 16:29.281
JJ, this is incredible.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.574
Thanks.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.328
Look, I know I said sorry earlier,
and I meant it.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.788
But that was for making you feel bad.

16:37.581 --> 16:40.751
I'm also sorry I didn't think you cared.

16:40.834 --> 16:44.213
I may not work off a study calendar,
or whatever you call it.

16:44.296 --> 16:46.381
But I always get my homework done.

16:46.465 --> 16:49.426
I know everyone thinks
I only care about judo.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.054
But I love school too.

16:54.223 --> 16:55.182
Princess, wait!

16:58.602 --> 17:02.856
-I tucked her in with the wrong blanket.
-I didn't know you had a puppy.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.441
Princess isn't ours.

17:04.525 --> 17:06.984
We're fostering her
till she finds a new home.

17:07.069 --> 17:10.071
You foster dogs? That's so cool.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.782
I just asked my parents
about getting a puppy.

17:12.866 --> 17:16.203
It's been kinda lonely
since my brother left for college.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.664
Well, Charles and I can find you a dog.

17:18.747 --> 17:21.541
We're really good at
matching people with dogs.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.923
With judo and all your other stuff,

17:28.006 --> 17:30.592
you're way too busy
for a dog like Princess.

17:30.676 --> 17:35.264
She needs a whole lot of attention.
A whole lot.

17:36.557 --> 17:41.144
Look. I couldn't imagine not having
my brother around. Must be hard.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.356
I think that's why my judo team
has become like family.

17:44.982 --> 17:48.819
But… sorry.
We should get back to the project.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.071
Yeah. You're right.

17:52.155 --> 17:55.200
Hey, Lizzie. Hey, JJ.

17:55.284 --> 17:58.829
If you want any judo pointers,
I'll be in the other room.

17:58.912 --> 18:02.499
-Just don't assume I know everything.
-You want some pointers?

18:05.502 --> 18:07.212
Go ahead. I'll finish up here.

18:11.383 --> 18:12.843
Okay, Remy. Throw me.

18:12.926 --> 18:16.054
-You won't hurt me.
-I know, but what if I hurt myself?

18:16.138 --> 18:17.890
Come on, Remy. You can do it.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.474
No fear.

18:19.558 --> 18:20.726
Right. No fear!

18:23.562 --> 18:27.441
Nah. There's fear.
What I'm feeling is definitely fear.

18:27.524 --> 18:28.609
Listen, Remy.

18:28.692 --> 18:33.322
I know it's scary, but here's the thing:
it's only scary once.

18:33.405 --> 18:37.075
After that, there really is no fear.
I promise.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.662
-Okay. Ready?
-I'm ready.

18:40.746 --> 18:41.747
Now!

18:44.666 --> 18:47.503
-Remy, that was amazing.
-It was, wasn't it?

18:47.586 --> 18:50.547
Now imagine how good you'll be
if you practice every day.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.424
You practice every day?

18:52.508 --> 18:56.345
Not only that, she wakes up,
has a smoothie, goes to school, stretches,

18:56.428 --> 18:59.681
has judo practice, eats a snack,
stretches again, eats dinner,

18:59.765 --> 19:03.060
-and then goes to bed.
-You forgot push-ups, 100 a night.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.853
But that was impressive.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.440
Okay. My turn.

19:08.524 --> 19:12.361
Oh, man. I didn't realize how late it got.

19:12.444 --> 19:17.366
It's laundry night, and I wanna get home
before I miss the last cycle. Bye.

19:18.867 --> 19:23.789
Do you really do all that stuff
every single day?

19:23.872 --> 19:26.291
Yeah. I love it.

19:26.375 --> 19:30.087
The more stuff I have to do,
the better I feel when it's all done.

19:30.587 --> 19:34.299
-Sounds weird. I know.
-No. It sounds good, actually.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.260
It sounds really good.

19:39.096 --> 19:40.097
That's my dad.

19:42.266 --> 19:46.019
Those do look really good.
Mind if I take one home?

19:46.603 --> 19:48.313
Pack you a to-go bag.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.817
Can you hold Princess for a second?

19:53.068 --> 19:55.028
Use a gentle scooping motion.

20:00.409 --> 20:02.828
Do you like singing lullabies?

20:08.458 --> 20:09.668
That looks great.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.963
We are shoo-ins
for Advanced History next year.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.381
Totally.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.675
-See you in there.
-Cool.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.052
Lizzie. There you are.

20:19.136 --> 20:22.472
Could you, like, become a genie,
blink and hide me from Thao forever?

20:23.891 --> 20:26.935
-Wait, for real?
-Who knew she was so high-maintenance?

20:27.019 --> 20:29.271
She had me pose as a gladiator
for three hours

20:29.354 --> 20:32.316
so she could get the clip figurines
just right.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.193
I still can't feel my calves.

20:36.987 --> 20:38.405
They're here.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.040
Princess is such a love.

20:48.123 --> 20:50.292
She slept in my arms
every night this week.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.962
And you're really, really sure
you're okay with all her rules?

20:54.046 --> 20:56.048
If I can do a hundred push-ups a day,

20:56.131 --> 20:59.218
I can handle a puppy
who likes being brushed a hundred times.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.929
It's my new favorite way of unwinding
after practice.

21:04.473 --> 21:05.766
I'll open the trunk.

21:08.227 --> 21:09.603
Hey, Charles.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.856
I'm proud of you. I mean,

21:12.940 --> 21:16.985
you took care of Princess all by yourself,
and you found her a home.

21:17.069 --> 21:19.613
And I didn't even have to
cut off her crusts.

21:21.406 --> 21:22.407
Nothing.
