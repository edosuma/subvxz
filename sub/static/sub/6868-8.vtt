00:19.374 --> 00:20.774
WD-40, Mother.

00:20.776 --> 00:22.196
Costs like, a nickel.

00:22.316 --> 00:26.383
Or maybe you could swallow your pride
and just apologize to your super.

00:26.385 --> 00:30.388
Oh, and to me, for ruining my Friday
night, which is now being spent here.

00:30.390 --> 00:33.490
So what, why the frantic phone call?

00:33.492 --> 00:34.459
Hello?

00:34.579 --> 00:36.160
Malory? Why did you call us?

00:36.162 --> 00:39.232
Because if it was -- oh.

00:39.234 --> 00:43.204
I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume
it had something to do with that.

00:43.206 --> 00:45.207
It's not what it looks like.

00:45.209 --> 00:46.976
Oh, well that's a relief.

00:46.978 --> 00:50.213
Because it looks like you're
sitting here with a gun.

00:50.215 --> 00:52.851
And over there, strapped to
a chair and shot to death,

00:52.853 --> 00:55.720
is a guy in a full-body latex catsuit!

00:55.722 --> 00:58.390
Or am I misreading the situation?!

00:58.392 --> 01:01.060
Well...
technically it's a zentai.

01:01.062 --> 01:01.794
Wh-...?!

01:01.796 --> 01:04.563
A zentai covers
the face and head.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.902
- I think a catsuit just stops here...
- Give me that.

01:07.904 --> 01:09.537
I didn't shoot him.

01:09.539 --> 01:12.474
So, you're saying the fact that
your gun has recently been fired, is --

01:12.476 --> 01:14.309
-- is unrelated to
the dead guy over there,

01:14.311 --> 01:15.945
who's chock full of bullets!

01:15.947 --> 01:19.183
- Well, obviously they're related...
- Yeah, do that,

01:19.185 --> 01:19.917
take that tone.

01:19.919 --> 01:22.254
But I swear,
I didn't shoot him!

01:22.256 --> 01:22.922
Okay.

01:22.924 --> 01:25.992
So I guess he walked in here already
shot, obviously panicking,

01:25.994 --> 01:28.495
so you had to restrain him
with these leather cuffs,

01:28.497 --> 01:31.265
and then to keep pressure on
the wounds you greased him up

01:31.267 --> 01:33.168
- and squeezed him into this...
- Zentai!

01:33.170 --> 01:35.604
And of course not, you ass!

01:35.606 --> 01:38.073
Someone broke in here and shot him!

01:38.075 --> 01:39.174
Okay, Malory?

01:39.176 --> 01:42.243
Well, unless it was the
creepy-old people-bondage-sex police,

01:42.245 --> 01:47.581
why would anyone break
in here and shoot him?!

01:47.583 --> 01:48.816
No answer?

01:48.818 --> 01:50.784
Okay, let's ask him!

01:50.786 --> 01:52.486
Ho-lee shit.

01:52.488 --> 01:55.789
Because he's Savio Mascalzone.

01:55.791 --> 01:58.391
- Um...
- Oh for -- the prime minister of Italy?

01:58.393 --> 01:59.525
The what?!

01:59.527 --> 02:01.094
And wait, doesn't Italy use a king?

02:01.096 --> 02:01.661
Wh-?

02:01.663 --> 02:02.729
No, they don't "use a king!"

02:02.731 --> 02:04.832
What year do you think this is?

02:04.834 --> 02:07.768
I -- yeah,
exactly, good question.

02:07.770 --> 02:11.006
- And uh, speaking of questions...
- No no no, don't --

02:11.008 --> 02:14.810
what're you -- don't go back there, Sterling, I--
I have a question!

02:14.812 --> 02:15.444
Mother!

02:15.446 --> 02:18.515
Why does this chair have no seat!

02:18.517 --> 02:20.651
And what!

02:20.653 --> 02:26.625
Is in his ass?!

02:28.077 --> 02:38.343
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:02.834 --> 03:03.585
Mother!

03:03.705 --> 03:05.605
What is in this man's ass?!

03:05.607 --> 03:10.109
Oh please, don't act like you've
never seen a... "marital aid" before.

03:10.111 --> 03:12.579
Not in a dead
prime minister's ass!

03:12.581 --> 03:14.147
And you don't have
to keep repeating it!

03:14.149 --> 03:16.216
We've established where it is!

03:16.218 --> 03:18.718
Yeah so, you
wanna move on to why?

03:18.720 --> 03:19.752
Wait, not why that!

03:19.754 --> 03:21.988
Why he's here!

03:21.990 --> 03:25.758
Savio and I met after the war,
when I was in Italy with Gladio.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.459
Who's that, his brother?!

03:27.461 --> 03:29.227
No, it --
Ewwwww!

03:29.229 --> 03:30.962
Are you finished?

03:30.964 --> 03:33.898
Hang on, ew, now I'm done.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.066
Operation Gladio.

03:35.068 --> 03:39.570
It was a NATO stay-behind mission, set
up to counter a possible Soviet invasion

03:39.572 --> 03:40.671
of Western Europe.

03:40.673 --> 03:44.908
But then it sort of turned into
this whole weird cryptofascist CIA

03:44.910 --> 03:48.211
shitshow, starring Allen Dulles
and a bunch of former Nazis.

03:48.213 --> 03:50.347
Thanks, Holly Hindsight.

03:50.349 --> 03:54.719
Anyway, Savio was in Italian intelligence--
Rimshot.

03:54.721 --> 03:57.122
-- shut up, and we were
working all these late nights,

03:57.124 --> 03:59.925
there was a mutual attraction,
one thing led to another...

03:59.927 --> 04:02.228
- Please skip ahead...
- And then he got married

04:02.230 --> 04:03.729
and went into politics.

04:03.731 --> 04:06.232
But ever since then, once a
year he'd slip away and

04:06.234 --> 04:08.568
we'd spend a romantic weekend together.

04:08.570 --> 04:11.103
Well, you nailed it!

04:11.105 --> 04:13.572
I mean, if this doesn't
just scream romance...!

04:13.574 --> 04:14.873
- Archer...
- What, Lana?!

04:14.875 --> 04:17.475
What's more romantic than a
dildo-party-slash-murder?!

04:17.476 --> 04:21.011
A murder I'm trying to get a handle
on, so could you shut up a second?!

04:21.012 --> 04:22.746
And he wasn't always into that!

04:22.748 --> 04:24.181
You mean vice versa?

04:24.183 --> 04:25.549
Shut up!

04:25.551 --> 04:30.487
As he grew older, Savio's tastes
became more and more... exotic.

04:30.489 --> 04:35.426
And so he started introducing all these...
accoutrements very gradually.

04:35.428 --> 04:36.495
Well, he'd have to.

04:36.497 --> 04:37.662
Thing's huge.

04:37.664 --> 04:38.697
Ow! Ow!

04:38.699 --> 04:42.901
Okay, okay, I -- okay!
God, your hands are like cricket bats.

04:42.903 --> 04:43.702
Shut up.

04:43.704 --> 04:45.938
So Malory, what happened, can
you walk us through the crime?

04:45.940 --> 04:49.942
Just the crime of murder, not
the crime of sodomy-by-rubber-eggplant.

04:49.944 --> 04:52.444
Savio was in town
to give a speech at the UN.

04:52.446 --> 04:55.614
We'd made plans to meet here, so
he gave his handlers the slip

04:55.616 --> 04:58.717
and arrived here at about... seven.

04:58.719 --> 05:01.887
We caught up over a
glass or two of champagne.

05:01.889 --> 05:07.025
Then I freshened up while Savio
got changed and... situated.

05:07.027 --> 05:11.697
- So he put the, uh, in his own...
- Yes, hush.

05:11.699 --> 05:15.368
I came out of the bedroom...
Savio, sei pronto?

05:15.370 --> 05:18.171
Si, cara mia, molto pronto!

05:18.173 --> 05:21.975
I crossed over to the chair,
and tightened his last restraint...

05:21.977 --> 05:23.243
Oho!

05:23.245 --> 05:25.412
Mi fai pazzo con libido!

05:25.414 --> 05:30.518
Then I went to refill my champagne--
Savio loved to be kept waiting --

05:30.520 --> 05:31.753
and then bang!

05:31.755 --> 05:33.722
In burst three men!

05:33.724 --> 05:34.856
Aaaaaghh! Oof!

05:34.858 --> 05:35.857
Che cosa?!

05:35.859 --> 05:37.793
Cara mia, che --
Savio!

05:37.795 --> 05:40.662
Andiamo! Subito!

05:40.664 --> 05:44.299
Wait, whoa, whoa, back up--
Why did you have a gun?!

05:44.301 --> 05:49.337
Hm? Oh, well, Savio liked
it to seem a little... dangerous.

05:49.339 --> 05:49.804
You know?

05:49.806 --> 05:50.672
No, Mother, I don't!

05:50.674 --> 05:52.640
Jesus, what else was
on tonight's menu?!

05:52.642 --> 05:54.909
Sex under a hive of Africanized bees?!

05:54.911 --> 05:56.277
Archer!

05:56.279 --> 05:59.814
- So, you fired three times...
- And missed!

05:59.816 --> 06:01.082
Can you believe it?

06:01.084 --> 06:01.816
No.

06:01.818 --> 06:04.585
Oh, sorry, was that rhetorical?

06:04.587 --> 06:06.054
Lawyer up, call the cops.

06:06.056 --> 06:07.322
What?!

06:07.324 --> 06:10.825
Oh, and hit the throttle on the
bourbon, because I'm gonna have to...

06:10.827 --> 06:12.493
I'm gonna have to bust you
in the face a couple times.

06:12.495 --> 06:13.995
What are you talking about?!

06:13.997 --> 06:14.796
Self-defense!

06:14.798 --> 06:15.964
It's your only shot!

06:15.966 --> 06:19.068
We gotta uncuff him and...
de-dildo him, obviously.

06:19.070 --> 06:22.305
Smash the furniture like he was
chasing you around all rapey,

06:22.307 --> 06:26.009
fortunately he's Italian so that
shouldn't be too hard a sell, then --

06:26.011 --> 06:27.277
I! Didn't! Shoot him!

06:27.279 --> 06:30.347
On purpose, exactly,
the gun just went off.

06:30.349 --> 06:33.317
But you probably wanna play
that a lot softer with a jury.

06:33.319 --> 06:34.318
A jury?!

06:34.320 --> 06:35.919
When you don't believe me?!

06:35.921 --> 06:38.455
Mother, come on, I
mean I want to believe you...

06:38.457 --> 06:42.059
But those bullet holes don't
prove anyone else was ever here.

06:42.061 --> 06:46.731
- Well, maybe those don't...
- Puttana!

06:46.733 --> 06:47.665
Ungh!

06:47.667 --> 06:48.399
What?!

06:48.401 --> 06:49.967
You got -- Malory, you got shot!

06:49.969 --> 06:51.736
Yes, I know dear, I was there.

06:51.738 --> 06:53.271
Well, lemme see,
take off your coat!

06:53.273 --> 06:55.006
No! I'm fine, it's
just a through-and-through.

06:55.008 --> 06:56.508
Mother! Malory!

06:56.510 --> 06:57.943
What, I put Bactine on it!

06:57.945 --> 06:58.710
Mother!

06:58.712 --> 06:59.411
Sterling!

06:59.413 --> 07:02.515
The Italian prime minister was
just assassinated in my apartment!

07:02.517 --> 07:05.151
And so I think an apology is in order!

07:05.153 --> 07:07.354
Thanks, I know
that's hard for you.

07:07.356 --> 07:07.787
Wh-?

07:07.789 --> 07:09.857
You two owe me an apology!

07:09.859 --> 07:10.591
For what?!

07:10.593 --> 07:11.759
Not believing me!

07:11.761 --> 07:14.628
How about for you
dragging us into your S&M--

07:14.630 --> 07:17.097
dildo-sex-murder freak show?!

07:17.099 --> 07:19.199
I -- look --
You look!

07:19.201 --> 07:22.069
I bet I'll never be able to have sex
again without thinking about this!

07:22.071 --> 07:25.305
I bet I won't even be able to
eat spaghetti and meatballs!

07:25.307 --> 07:26.106
Oh my God.

07:26.108 --> 07:27.107
What? What?

07:27.109 --> 07:28.509
I could eat.

07:28.511 --> 07:31.344
I mean, not necessarily spaghetti
and meatballs, but...

07:31.346 --> 07:34.639
Not necessarily not
spaghetti and meatballs.

07:34.759 --> 07:36.486
I mean I really like
spaghetti and meatballs.

07:36.969 --> 07:39.934
Man if I don't get some spaghetti
and meatballs, I may literally die.

07:42.993 --> 07:45.896
- Oh, and thanks so much...
- You're welcome.

07:45.898 --> 07:48.899
But you should wait'll you try it,
I'm just kinda winging it here.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.069
I meant for
dragging me into this.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.404
Still welcome.

07:52.406 --> 07:52.904
So.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.540
We've got dead Italian prime minister
in the living room, which --

07:55.542 --> 07:57.409
Sucks, I bet he
knew how to make sauce.

07:57.411 --> 07:59.411
Which will be hard to explain.

07:59.413 --> 08:03.015
Especially given the circumstances
leading up to his death, which were --

08:03.017 --> 08:03.816
Dildoey.

08:03.818 --> 08:04.784
Unseemly!

08:04.786 --> 08:09.188
- Potato podildo...
- So "plausible deniability"

08:09.190 --> 08:11.291
isn't a super-realistic goal here.

08:11.293 --> 08:13.193
So we need to sneak
the body out somehow.

08:13.195 --> 08:15.896
Sure, we'll just walk a
dead body right out the front door!

08:15.898 --> 08:16.763
Idiot!

08:16.765 --> 08:17.531
What, then?!

08:17.533 --> 08:18.632
Burn the apartment down?!

08:18.634 --> 08:21.268
We're not burning
down my apartment!

08:21.270 --> 08:21.902
You sure?

08:21.904 --> 08:23.804
Shut up, I hit
broil instead of bake.

08:23.806 --> 08:25.673
Well, blood loss
can make you stupid.

08:25.675 --> 08:27.542
Can I please look at your wound?

08:27.544 --> 08:28.042
No!

08:28.044 --> 08:30.712
Nor can you burn down my apartment,
so think of something else.

08:30.714 --> 08:33.115
I shall fetch a rug!

08:33.116 --> 08:33.916
Something else!

08:33.918 --> 08:36.784
You're not rolling him
up in one of my rugs!

08:36.787 --> 08:37.452
Why not?

08:37.453 --> 08:38.754
Because then what?!

08:38.756 --> 08:40.889
We...
get some coveralls, and a van.

08:40.890 --> 08:43.857
Like a carpet cleaning van, and just
walk him right out the front door.

08:43.860 --> 08:45.493
You just called
me an idiot for that!

08:45.495 --> 08:48.295
Your version
didn't have coveralls.

08:48.297 --> 08:50.764
Could we go out
through the basement?

08:50.766 --> 08:51.165
No.

08:51.167 --> 08:54.467
We'd have to go past the super's
apartment, and his door is always open.

08:54.469 --> 08:58.539
I assume to let the stink of cabbage
waft through the halls, but --

08:58.541 --> 09:00.508
So? You think he'd be a problem?

09:00.510 --> 09:01.275
God, yes.

09:01.277 --> 09:05.947
- We're not on the best of terms...
- It's just, at Christmas,

09:05.949 --> 09:09.585
the tenants usually gimme a small
consideration, for the work I do all yeer

09:09.587 --> 09:10.553
keepin up the bildin.

09:10.555 --> 09:12.355
We surely count on it, ma'am.

09:12.357 --> 09:15.625
Specially this yeer, as we had
more'n the usual medical bills.

09:15.627 --> 09:17.027
Your point being?

09:17.029 --> 09:21.131
Just that, fer the tird year runnin...
Ya gimme a potato.

09:21.133 --> 09:24.634
Oh dear, so once again
you're faced with the classic

09:24.636 --> 09:26.269
"Irishman's Dilemma."

09:26.271 --> 09:32.943
Do I eat the potato now, or let it
ferment, so I can drink it later?

09:32.945 --> 09:34.911
Will I get
the operation now, Da?

09:34.913 --> 09:37.981
No son... yer gonnaa die.

09:37.983 --> 09:39.616
What is your
problem with the Irish?

09:39.618 --> 09:43.020
You mean besides not being
on our side in World War Two?

09:43.022 --> 09:44.988
Yeah, besides that.

09:44.990 --> 09:45.989
Wait, seriously?

09:45.991 --> 09:47.124
They were Nazis?!

09:47.126 --> 09:47.825
No.

09:47.827 --> 09:49.827
- Not Japanese...
- Neutral!

09:49.829 --> 09:52.563
And now, since I don't wanna be
an accessory after the fact,

09:52.565 --> 09:55.733
how's about we figure out a way to get
that body out of the damn apartment?!

09:55.735 --> 09:57.835
Where'd we land
on the coveralls thing?

09:57.837 --> 09:58.269
Archer?

09:58.271 --> 10:00.171
Because I don't even
know where we'd get coveralls

10:00.173 --> 10:04.708
this time of night, so --
Soooo... if we can't get the body out of

10:04.710 --> 10:07.510
- here in one piece...
- Nooope!

10:07.512 --> 10:08.077
What?

10:08.079 --> 10:09.345
Lana, it's the only way.

10:09.347 --> 10:10.179
What is?

10:10.181 --> 10:13.850
No! Malory, I've done some messed
up shit working for you, but I am not,

10:13.852 --> 10:16.219
repeat not, chopping up a dead body!

10:16.221 --> 10:17.419
Oh. Ewww! Mother!

10:17.421 --> 10:19.955
What! My God, do you want
me to get the electric chair?!

10:19.957 --> 10:22.191
For a murder you both
know I didn't commit?!

10:22.193 --> 10:23.759
Malory, I just can't.

10:23.761 --> 10:24.627
Me neither.

10:24.629 --> 10:25.594
Can't?

10:25.596 --> 10:26.529
Or won't.

10:26.531 --> 10:30.599
I --
Whatever, call it her can't, me won't.

10:32.303 --> 10:33.469
No, hey, Mother, c'mon.

10:33.471 --> 10:35.805
Stop that!

10:35.807 --> 10:36.839
Here, here, look!

10:36.841 --> 10:38.174
I'm gonna get help!

10:38.176 --> 10:41.477
From, from who-hoo-hoooo?!

10:41.479 --> 10:45.314
I need access to a two-inch
drain, hot water, three GFCI outlets,

10:45.316 --> 10:49.385
this bathroom should do nicely, and a pot
of coffee, just like I like my women:

10:49.387 --> 10:52.188
black, bitter, preferably fair trade.

10:52.190 --> 10:54.423
Oh, and your sauce needs less salt.

10:54.425 --> 10:56.992
- How can you --
- Put two halves of a potato in with the sauce,

10:56.994 --> 10:58.060
it'll absorb the salt.

10:58.062 --> 11:00.029
Oh, and I assume that's our patient?

11:00.031 --> 11:01.364
Not ours, Krieger.

11:01.366 --> 11:03.332
Yours.

11:03.334 --> 11:04.767
Thank you.

11:04.769 --> 11:06.002
Ugh, too salty.

11:06.004 --> 11:07.437
Yeah, you got a potato?

11:07.439 --> 11:09.472
What is this, Christmas?

11:09.474 --> 11:11.641
And is Krieger... hard at work?

11:11.643 --> 11:14.277
He literally might be, yeah.

11:14.279 --> 11:14.845
Ew.

11:14.847 --> 11:17.347
Well, say what you will about him--
I did.

11:17.349 --> 11:18.248
he's discreet.

11:18.250 --> 11:21.118
So no one else will ever know about this whole--
Aaaaaaaaaghhhh!

11:21.120 --> 11:23.320
What in the--
Hell is that?!

11:23.322 --> 11:25.489
Hopefully my
greatest work yet.

11:25.491 --> 11:27.925
No no no no no!

11:27.927 --> 11:30.727
Whatever this is, I am not
getting mixed up in it!

11:30.729 --> 11:31.762
Too late.

11:32.832 --> 11:34.832
Hey whoa, whoa,
everybody calm down!

11:34.834 --> 11:35.766
It's not what it looks like!

11:35.768 --> 11:37.434
Well, then,
what is it, exactly?!

11:37.436 --> 11:40.705
'Cause it sure as shit ain't
a surprise party, Krieger!

11:40.707 --> 11:41.439
Ya big fat liar!

11:41.441 --> 11:43.975
Someone's trying to frame
Malory for murdering the prime

11:43.977 --> 11:44.876
minister of Italy.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.845
I bet
it's that wicked king!

11:46.847 --> 11:47.378
So?!

11:47.380 --> 11:48.946
Why'd Krieger drag us into it?!

11:48.948 --> 11:50.080
Yes, Krieger!

11:50.082 --> 11:50.714
Why?!

11:50.716 --> 11:53.417
I needed help...
disseminating him.

11:53.419 --> 11:54.751
Ewww!

11:54.753 --> 11:55.552
Not what it means.

11:55.554 --> 11:57.488
But it's still
pretty gross though.

11:57.490 --> 11:58.355
And brilliant!

11:58.357 --> 12:00.224
When I'm done, each one of us
will walk out the front door

12:00.226 --> 12:02.226
- carrying a small parcel...
- How small?!

12:02.228 --> 12:02.926
Eh.

12:02.928 --> 12:05.028
Then on our way home, we
simply drop the parcels into

12:05.030 --> 12:08.064
seven different trash cans
in three different boroughs.

12:08.066 --> 12:10.233
That's... actually pretty smart.

12:10.235 --> 12:11.835
And hopefully,
when you look at all the

12:11.837 --> 12:15.806
different drop points on a map,
it'll look like a big smiley face.

12:15.808 --> 12:18.108
That's actually pretty gross.

12:18.110 --> 12:21.511
Kind of clever.

12:21.513 --> 12:22.879
Every time!

12:22.881 --> 12:26.916
Every single time we come over here,
we have to help you get rid of

12:26.918 --> 12:27.550
a dead body!

12:27.552 --> 12:29.985
Well, you've
only been here twice.

12:29.987 --> 12:32.854
Speaking of, why the hell
was the prime minister of Italy here?

12:32.856 --> 12:33.789
Don't ask.

12:33.791 --> 12:36.125
And follow up, did those
dastardly dagoes kill

12:36.127 --> 12:39.061
him and then dress him up like
a big giant penis, or --

12:39.063 --> 12:40.896
Oh God, that reminds me.

12:40.898 --> 12:41.430
Krieger?

12:41.432 --> 12:42.665
Yeah, I found it!

12:42.667 --> 12:43.299
Found what?

12:43.301 --> 12:44.434
Don't ask.

12:44.436 --> 12:45.134
Can I keep it?

12:45.136 --> 12:45.902
Keep what?

12:45.904 --> 12:46.603
Don't ask!

12:46.605 --> 12:48.605
Just get it
out of here, please!

12:48.607 --> 12:51.342
- Yeah, take that tone...
- I'd like to know this

12:51.344 --> 12:53.210
could possibly get any worse.

12:53.212 --> 12:56.547
Well, for one thing, there's
not enough sauce for everybody.

12:56.549 --> 12:57.714
NYPD!

12:57.716 --> 12:58.749
Open up, please?

12:58.751 --> 13:01.251
Jeez it! It's the cops!
Oh. Busted.

13:01.253 --> 13:03.586
And-or the
police could show up.

13:03.588 --> 13:05.388
Oh for the --
now what do we do?!

13:05.390 --> 13:07.841
Cover your arm up,
answer the door, and stall them.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.805
And then. Somebody get me a Number 10
can of tomatoes.

13:11.558 --> 13:12.247
What?

13:12.367 --> 13:13.941
Sorry. Not enough sauce.

13:16.072 --> 13:17.215
NYPD!

13:17.335 --> 13:18.540
C'mon lady, open the door!

13:18.542 --> 13:19.574
Comiiing!

13:19.576 --> 13:26.983
Sorry, I was in the-- kitchen,
I'm making spaghetti and --meatballs.

13:26.985 --> 13:29.018
Hi, I'm --
Italian, huh?

13:29.138 --> 13:30.353
That's a coincidence.

13:30.355 --> 13:31.988
Oh, are you
Italian, Officer...?

13:31.990 --> 13:34.057
No, and it's Detective.
Murphy.

13:34.059 --> 13:35.088
Irish.

13:35.208 --> 13:35.859
That's right.

13:35.861 --> 13:39.050
But we got an anonymous tip that
Savio Mascalzone was up here.

13:39.170 --> 13:41.445
Oooh, who's that, some mobster?

13:41.565 --> 13:43.628
Prime minister.
Of Italy.

13:43.651 --> 13:45.066
Doesn't Italy use a king?

13:45.068 --> 13:46.467
I wouldn't know.

13:46.469 --> 13:47.368
Somebody dead?

13:47.370 --> 13:48.770
What? Oh!

13:48.772 --> 13:49.604
My bird.

13:49.606 --> 13:50.705
Little Tweetsie.

13:50.707 --> 13:51.473
Uh-huh.

13:51.475 --> 13:54.376
Well, that's another coincidence,
'cause this anonymous tip said

13:54.378 --> 13:55.944
Mascalzone was dead up here.

13:55.946 --> 13:56.678
What?

13:56.680 --> 13:58.413
Oh, for heaven's sake!

13:58.415 --> 13:59.915
Yeah, right
here in the living room.

13:59.917 --> 14:04.520
Well, as you can see, there
hasn't been a murder in here, my gosh!

14:04.522 --> 14:07.022
Although I guess someone
must've spilled a drink.

14:07.024 --> 14:09.758
I have a few dear friends
over for a dinner party.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.692
Uh-huh.

14:10.694 --> 14:11.793
Mind if I talk to them?

14:11.795 --> 14:15.063
Heavens, no, of course not, but--
What's in here?

14:15.065 --> 14:15.998
Bathroom?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.032
Uh-huh.

14:17.034 --> 14:21.236
My guests are in here, Detective, but--
What are you doing--

14:21.238 --> 14:23.805
from the left, dear,
one serves from the left!

14:23.807 --> 14:26.809
What's gotten
into you, Calpurnia?!

14:26.811 --> 14:28.010
My mistake, ma'am.

14:28.012 --> 14:31.380
Well, I should
say it is, Calpurnia!

14:31.382 --> 14:34.383
Muthah, your maid is -- oh, hello!

14:34.385 --> 14:35.017
Evening.

14:35.019 --> 14:38.187
- Sorry to disturb your, uh...
- Elegant dinnah pahty,

14:38.189 --> 14:43.193
for the most elegant
people in all of New Yawk.

14:43.195 --> 14:43.993
Uh-huh.

14:43.995 --> 14:45.862
But we got a tip there'd
been a murder up here.

14:45.864 --> 14:48.298
Good heavens, a murder?

14:48.300 --> 14:53.403
Well, apart from this sullen wench
murdering good etiquette, owww!

14:53.405 --> 15:00.978
I find the very suggestion laughable.

15:00.980 --> 15:02.713
So, you don't
mind if I look around?

15:02.715 --> 15:03.947
Uh, no!

15:03.949 --> 15:05.449
Of course not!

15:05.451 --> 15:06.350
Calpurnia?

15:06.352 --> 15:08.552
May I speak with you in the kitchen?

15:08.554 --> 15:10.453
Certainly.

15:10.455 --> 15:14.023
And I'll let you get back to your--
Elegant

15:14.025 --> 15:17.594
dinnah pahty!

15:17.596 --> 15:20.597
I hate you all so much.

15:20.599 --> 15:26.337
No one cares, Figgis, you were
only invited to round out the numbahs.

15:34.346 --> 15:35.713
What, how is this my fault?!

15:35.715 --> 15:38.817
Gee, where to start...
oh! The murder?

15:38.819 --> 15:41.220
Oh, I thought you meant
that silly French maid costume.

15:41.222 --> 15:43.622
Which makes you look ridiculous.

15:43.624 --> 15:46.959
And why do you even - never
mind, I don't even wanna know.

15:46.961 --> 15:49.295
Good, it's
none of your beeswax.

15:49.297 --> 15:49.862
Here.

15:49.864 --> 15:52.564
I hope you won't need it, but--
Why would I need...?

15:52.566 --> 15:55.134
- Oh, huh-uh, noop.
- Lana!

15:55.136 --> 15:56.568
Malory! I am not!

15:56.570 --> 16:00.305
Killing a--
A perfectly nice dinnah, Calpurnia!

16:00.307 --> 16:04.342
By God, if you were my servant, I'd
have you over my knee in a trice!

16:04.344 --> 16:06.844
And Muthah, the constable
wishes a word.

16:06.846 --> 16:07.711
He does?

16:07.713 --> 16:08.779
I mean yes?

16:08.781 --> 16:10.614
Yeah, sorry
for the intrusion.

16:10.616 --> 16:11.715
That tip musta been a hoax.

16:11.717 --> 16:13.249
I checked out the whole
apartment, it's clean.

16:13.251 --> 16:15.018
- No thanks to this one...
- Mmmm...?!

16:15.020 --> 16:15.752
Sullen wench.

16:15.754 --> 16:19.055
I mean indubitably Lieutenant.

16:19.057 --> 16:22.625
So then I'll,
uh, just be on my way.

16:22.627 --> 16:25.929
It's just, who would call in with a
fake tip like that, though, ya know?

16:25.931 --> 16:29.065
I wouldn't be surprised
if it was our super, Mr. Herlihy.

16:29.067 --> 16:29.899
He drinks.

16:29.901 --> 16:33.637
Thanks, I'll check on --
oh hey, I never checked this bathroom.

16:33.639 --> 16:34.037
Ya mind?

16:34.039 --> 16:36.172
I -- no, of course not.

16:36.174 --> 16:39.576
Be my guest.

16:46.282 --> 16:49.451
Whew! Oh!
Sorry, didn't know anyone was waiting.

16:49.453 --> 16:52.653
But I'd recommend the other bathroom,
I mean I did what I could,

16:52.655 --> 16:55.322
but you can only ask so
much of a vanilla candle.

16:55.324 --> 16:56.757
Dinner ready?

16:56.759 --> 17:00.693
- My God...
- Ugh! Yeah, he really did a number on it.

17:00.695 --> 17:02.762
Might wanna make sure he didn't
leave ya an upper decker.

17:02.764 --> 17:04.731
Sorry again for the intrusion, ma'am.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.601
And Herlihy, you said his name was?

17:07.603 --> 17:08.469
Hm? Oh, yes.

17:08.471 --> 17:10.438
Yes, that's right.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.172
Ow! Ow!

17:11.174 --> 17:12.374
Lana, c'mon, I was -- ow!

17:12.376 --> 17:14.476
I'll show you a sullen wench!

17:15.780 --> 17:16.578
Right then.

17:16.579 --> 17:20.082
That snoopy detective is gone,
thanks to Dr. Krieger, so --

17:20.084 --> 17:20.782
Krieger?

17:20.785 --> 17:21.617
What about the rest of us?

17:21.618 --> 17:25.621
The rest of you can get out of
my clothes, and then out of my house.

17:25.623 --> 17:29.424
But thank you all so much for coming!

17:29.426 --> 17:30.325
Loved it.

17:30.327 --> 17:31.092
Never, never again.

17:31.094 --> 17:32.594
Thanks
for dead guy in a box.

17:32.596 --> 17:33.328
Not very elegant.

17:33.330 --> 17:35.396
Oh no, thanks
for having us, amazing.

17:35.398 --> 17:38.499
And remember, smiley face!
And thank you.

17:38.501 --> 17:39.466
Krieger, wait.

17:39.468 --> 17:42.136
The bathroom, the body, how did you...?

17:42.138 --> 17:44.671
Shhhhh!
Shh shh shh shh shhhhhhh.

17:44.673 --> 17:46.040
You don't wanna know.

17:46.042 --> 17:48.976
But you do probably wanna
wash your lips now.

17:48.978 --> 17:51.612
Ugh.

17:51.614 --> 17:53.247
Screw you, Archer!

17:53.249 --> 17:54.248
Sullen wench?!

17:54.250 --> 17:54.748
Lana!

17:54.750 --> 17:55.916
C'mon, I was just kidding!

17:55.918 --> 17:57.184
I had to make it look good!

17:57.186 --> 18:00.654
- You had to make it look good...
- Well, and also annoy you.

18:00.656 --> 18:02.823
Walther PP, chambered
for thirty-two ACP.

18:02.825 --> 18:04.592
What's the magazine capacity?

18:04.594 --> 18:05.593
Uh..gh. Eight.

18:05.595 --> 18:06.361
Eight rounds.

18:06.363 --> 18:07.729
Plus one in the chamber.

18:07.731 --> 18:09.598
For a total... of nine.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.166
Hey thanks, Rainman.

18:11.168 --> 18:11.933
Your point being?

18:11.935 --> 18:13.435
Malory's clip was empty.

18:13.437 --> 18:15.871
But she said she only
fired three shots.

18:15.873 --> 18:20.609
Oh my God, so you're saying
Mother lured Mascalzone up there...

18:20.611 --> 18:24.579
Greased him into a six-foot manrubber,
strapped him to a chair...

18:24.581 --> 18:25.513
Sei pronto?

18:25.515 --> 18:28.216
Si, cara mia,
sono molto pronto!

18:28.218 --> 18:29.884
Bene. Anch'io.

18:29.886 --> 18:31.118
Oho!

18:31.120 --> 18:33.353
Mi fai pazzo con libido!

18:33.355 --> 18:34.321
I know dear.

18:34.323 --> 18:35.488
But you have to wait.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.824
Calls us... What?

18:37.826 --> 18:40.327
Mother calm -- I'm on my way!

18:40.329 --> 18:41.027
Don't move.

18:41.029 --> 18:43.496
I'll probably be back.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.733
Then she pulls a gun on him?!

18:45.735 --> 18:46.667
Che cosa?!

18:46.669 --> 18:47.468
What is this?!

18:47.470 --> 18:48.469
A crock of shit!

18:48.471 --> 18:51.205
Because that would mean she
called the cops on herself!

18:51.207 --> 18:54.275
Knowing they'd never come back
after they searched her apartment.

18:54.277 --> 18:56.645
Which was full of people, and spotless.

18:56.647 --> 18:59.282
Oh my God, do
the math, Rainman!

18:59.284 --> 19:07.124
The wall was shot three times...
Mascalzone was shot five times!

19:07.126 --> 19:09.993
For a total, wait for it, of eight!

19:09.995 --> 19:10.694
Yeah.

19:10.696 --> 19:11.728
Plus the one in her arm.

19:11.730 --> 19:12.262
Wh-?!

19:12.264 --> 19:14.364
So what, Mother shot herself?!

19:14.366 --> 19:15.932
Oh my God!

19:15.934 --> 19:17.534
Ungh!

19:17.536 --> 19:18.968
Mio dio! Perche?!

19:18.970 --> 19:19.736
Why?

19:19.738 --> 19:21.504
I'll tell you exactly why.

19:21.506 --> 19:23.272
Before I kill you.

19:23.274 --> 19:24.506
Operation Gladio.

19:24.508 --> 19:25.608
Gladio?!

19:25.610 --> 19:29.878
Which would mean Mother's been
banging him once a year for like

19:29.880 --> 19:35.517
thirty-five years, and the whole
time she's been holding a grudge,

19:35.519 --> 19:39.553
just waiting to... Holy shit.

19:39.555 --> 19:40.354
She killed him.

19:40.356 --> 19:42.589
And got us to
dispose of the body.

19:42.591 --> 19:43.991
Ugh. But why?

19:43.993 --> 19:45.092
After all this time?

19:45.094 --> 19:48.229
Well, to be honest, until
recently the sex has been

19:48.231 --> 19:49.930
pretty phenomenal --
Grazie.

19:49.932 --> 19:52.099
And I figured,
eh, what's the hurry?

19:52.101 --> 19:55.036
But then you started getting... weird.

19:55.038 --> 19:56.971
But why
you make la vendetta?

19:56.973 --> 19:59.741
Because one night, all
those years ago in Rome,

19:59.743 --> 20:03.779
you and your fascist thugs gunned
down a young man in the street.

20:03.781 --> 20:04.680
A beautiful man.

20:04.682 --> 20:08.851
- Blue eyes, full lips, black thick wavy hair...
- Perche?

20:08.853 --> 20:09.953
What was his crime?

20:09.955 --> 20:13.223
Well, I wouldn't call speaking
out against the rebirtof fascism

20:13.225 --> 20:14.592
a crime.

20:14.594 --> 20:16.127
More of a mistake.

20:16.129 --> 20:19.130
By a beautiful, idealistic young man.

20:19.132 --> 20:21.165
Who may have beenee my son's father.

20:21.167 --> 20:22.766
May have been?!

20:22.768 --> 20:24.201
You don't know?!

20:24.203 --> 20:24.835
Madon'!

20:24.837 --> 20:28.237
Che tipo di puttana sei?!

20:28.239 --> 20:31.107
Che tipo davvero.

20:31.109 --> 20:32.608
Cazzo fascista.

20:32.610 --> 20:33.842
Who knows, it's Malory.

20:33.844 --> 20:35.811
You really wanna know
why she killed a guy?

20:35.813 --> 20:38.079
I... do not, no.

20:38.081 --> 20:41.883
Although... I am curious why she
wouldn't take off that trenchcoat.

20:41.885 --> 20:42.851
Mm!

20:42.853 --> 20:44.987
Honey, you still got it.

20:44.989 --> 20:46.755
Bow chicka bow bow!

20:46.757 --> 20:47.690
Uh huh huh!

20:47.692 --> 20:51.595
So much of this I never
wanna know the answer to.

20:51.597 --> 20:54.097
Okay, how 'bout a slice?

20:54.099 --> 20:56.842
God, what's with me and Italian lately?
