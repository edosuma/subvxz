00:14.810 --> 00:17.529
Are we on?

00:26.241 --> 00:26.637
Hello.

00:25.362 --> 00:28.563
When? Thank you.

00:28.642 --> 00:31.160
Yes. I'll tell him.

00:36.133 --> 00:38.192
Sir.

00:40.275 --> 00:42.335
He's gone.

00:46.522 --> 00:48.935
Contact family members…

00:49.008 --> 00:52.139
the various corporate boards…

00:52.219 --> 00:54.454
and business interests.

00:54.531 --> 00:56.979
Yes, sir.

00:59.432 --> 01:02.045
Sir, I—

01:02.125 --> 01:05.019
I am so sorry
for your loss.

01:13.378 --> 01:17.168
Am I speakin'
to a Theophilus Hamilton of Birmingham?

01:17.245 --> 01:19.410
Sir? Yes, sir. This is he.

01:19.488 --> 01:22.346
Name's Howard Stevens.
You can call me Red.

01:22.388 --> 01:25.453
I need a lawyer for a few
business ideas I have…

01:25.495 --> 01:27.660
a few still
in the dream stage.

01:41.339 --> 01:45.365
Though the skies may weep…

01:45.443 --> 01:49.039
the Bible assures us that
precious in the sight of the Lord…

01:49.079 --> 01:51.274
is the death of his saints.

01:51.347 --> 01:54.744
I wonder who the old man
negotiated with for the rain.

01:54.784 --> 01:57.251
Well, it's a sure bet
he's laughin'…

01:57.319 --> 01:59.310
watchin' us get soaked.

02:00.322 --> 02:02.950
Yeah, well,
now it's his turn.

02:03.025 --> 02:05.720
There's not a person here
whose life, in some way…

02:05.760 --> 02:09.092
has not been touched
by Howard “Red” Stevens.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.763
Red often quoted
Malcolm Muggeridge…

02:12.833 --> 02:16.064
saying that, “Every happening,
great or small…

02:16.136 --> 02:19.764
”is a parable by which
God speaks to us…

02:19.839 --> 02:23.104
and the art of life
is to get the message.”

02:25.010 --> 02:30.289
May the message of Red Stevens
continue in the hearts of those he leaves behind.

02:31.416 --> 02:34.914
–What are you doing? You're gonna get all wet.
–Bill.

02:38.889 --> 02:43.508
Even though Dad moved his corporate offices
from Texas many years ago…

02:44.594 --> 02:46.619
for tax reasons…

02:46.696 --> 02:50.326
he always said he wanted
to be buried under Texas soil.

03:12.919 --> 03:15.409
Is that him?

03:16.889 --> 03:18.823
That's him.

03:32.269 --> 03:35.500
Mom.

03:35.572 --> 03:39.029
–You're late.
–For what?

03:45.647 --> 03:47.774
Give me some of that!

03:47.849 --> 03:49.840
Settle down over there.

04:00.026 --> 04:02.256
Good morning.

04:02.328 --> 04:05.364
Before we start,
I'd like to say how much Red…

04:06.432 --> 04:08.422
meant to me personally.

04:09.668 --> 04:13.627
As you know, we started out
as business partners…

04:15.873 --> 04:19.741
and we ended up
as friends.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.138
I am deeply grieved
by his passing.

04:24.214 --> 04:26.409
Yes, well, that's very nice.

04:26.482 --> 04:28.473
Now, may we proceed?

04:36.225 --> 04:39.716
Red's will
is in his own words…

04:39.794 --> 04:43.958
still, every bit
as legal and binding—

04:44.031 --> 04:46.760
Blah, blah, blah.

04:48.201 --> 04:51.295
“And, so,
my eldest son, Bill…

04:52.572 --> 04:56.769
I leave my company,
Panhandle Oil and Gas.”

04:56.842 --> 05:00.437
Currently worth $600 million.

05:00.512 --> 05:05.410
“However, Bill, since you had
zero interest in my company while I was alive…

05:05.450 --> 05:09.078
”I don't imagine that will
change much after my death.

05:09.152 --> 05:11.281
Therefore, the board
will maintain control.”

05:11.321 --> 05:16.417
Excuse me, but my client would like
to explore all of his options.

05:16.492 --> 05:19.154
Your client
has no more options.

05:19.228 --> 05:21.290
One of those instructions
Mr Hamilton skipped over…

05:21.330 --> 05:25.393
is Red's desire that each of you vacate
after receiving your portion of the estate.

05:25.433 --> 05:29.030
–As in, leave the room.
–What the— She can't talk to me like that.

05:29.070 --> 05:33.802
–Well, do something.
–You can go now, Mr Stevens.

05:33.874 --> 05:36.837
–What— All right. Fine. Fine.
–We should really go.

05:36.877 --> 05:39.208
I have never been so humiliated.

05:39.279 --> 05:41.641
Did you see that old man
talking' to me that way?

05:41.681 --> 05:45.377
And you guys just sat there
and said absolutely nothin'.

05:47.219 --> 05:49.847
That's it?

05:51.323 --> 05:55.224
–A cow farm?
–A 10,000-acre cow farm.

05:58.963 --> 06:02.295
Well, what's that worth anyway?

06:04.567 --> 06:07.001
Ruth, come on.
Come here.

06:07.070 --> 06:10.004
What exactly do we get?

06:10.072 --> 06:12.802
A place for you
to take your mistress.

06:12.875 --> 06:15.503
Come on, Ruth.
Let me explain.

06:15.577 --> 06:18.339
–I want to see everything! Full disclosure.
–Come on, Jack. Let's go.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.775
–Good day, Mr Stevens.
–You said you had a strategy!

06:20.815 --> 06:23.511
–This is a long way from over.
–You said it was a slam dunk!

06:23.551 --> 06:28.146
–“To Sarah, widow of my late son,
Jay Howard Stevens…

06:28.221 --> 06:31.191
”I am truly sorry
for the events of the past.

06:31.258 --> 06:35.819
”Please know that Jay‘s death
represents the greatest tragedy…

06:35.895 --> 06:38.022
”I have ever experienced.

06:38.097 --> 06:42.760
”I leave you control of my Myers Park estate
where you now reside…

06:42.834 --> 06:47.533
”and a managed trust for expenses as long as you live.”
–There we go.

06:47.605 --> 06:51.468
“Since your choice
of male companionship is vast and varied…

06:51.508 --> 06:56.721
the deed and title for the house
will remain under the control of my trustees.”

06:58.815 --> 07:01.909
–Good day, Mr Hamilton.
–Good day.

07:04.186 --> 07:08.816
It's amazing just how far
the fruit can fall from the tree.

07:08.890 --> 07:11.017
And still roll
a great distance.

07:11.259 --> 07:14.887
Nice of you to show up.

07:14.962 --> 07:16.987
You're in time for nothin'.

07:17.064 --> 07:18.998
Let's go.

07:24.538 --> 07:26.802
Jason.

07:26.874 --> 07:29.775
How do you know
my name?

07:29.844 --> 07:33.307
It's my business to know everyone
named in your grandfather's will.

07:33.347 --> 07:36.377
Let's cut the b.s., 'cause
I know what he left me— nothing.

07:36.417 --> 07:38.991
Walk away— you'll never know,
will you?

07:48.561 --> 07:51.291
Jason?

08:02.342 --> 08:04.401
So, what's in the box?

08:04.477 --> 08:07.139
Your inheritance.

08:08.515 --> 08:10.506
Have a seat.

08:12.985 --> 08:17.549
Does the box or the seal appear to have been
tampered with in any way?

08:17.589 --> 08:19.580
No.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.028
Then therefore
witness this day…

08:26.098 --> 08:29.864
that I am
breaking the seal…

08:29.935 --> 08:33.131
affixed in my presence
by Red himself.

08:44.148 --> 08:48.016
–Miss Hastings.
–Yes, sir.

08:53.524 --> 08:56.049
–Are we on?
–Yes, we are.

08:56.127 --> 08:59.187
Mmm. Well, then,
If you're watching this…

08:59.263 --> 09:01.254
I must be dead.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.323
That's a strange concept.

09:03.401 --> 09:05.665
How was my funeral?
Well attended?

09:05.736 --> 09:08.204
I hope it rained.

09:08.272 --> 09:10.763
Hamilton, Miss Hastings…

09:10.842 --> 09:13.745
I hope you're having
a better day than I am.

09:13.777 --> 09:16.879
If you've just been
with my family, I doubt it.

09:17.948 --> 09:21.281
Jason, I made a lot
Of mistakes with our family…

09:21.351 --> 09:25.253
but you're the one
I think I hurt the most.

09:25.322 --> 09:28.618
The only way I can make it up to you
is to not give you anything.

09:28.658 --> 09:30.922
I knew it.

09:30.994 --> 09:34.524
What I mean by that is that
I'm not giving you anything just yet.

09:34.564 --> 09:36.589
So sit back down there.

09:38.535 --> 09:42.266
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

09:42.339 --> 09:47.303
How can I give you something and not have it
ruin you like your uncles and aunts?

09:47.343 --> 09:50.437
Even some of their kids.

09:50.513 --> 09:53.778
So I want to give you a gift—
a series of gifts…

09:53.849 --> 09:56.943
leading up to, well…

09:57.019 --> 09:59.048
I wanna call it
“the ultimate gift.”

09:59.088 --> 10:01.784
Now, you fail in anyway,
it's over.

10:01.857 --> 10:03.950
You get nothing.

10:04.026 --> 10:08.588
And everything you do
must be to Mr Hamilton's satisfaction.

10:10.499 --> 10:14.195
You might wanna make friends with him
sooner than later.

10:15.270 --> 10:17.898
This is a voice-activated
Conversay.

10:17.972 --> 10:21.069
It allows two-way communication
between our office and you.

10:21.109 --> 10:25.102
And you can also replay
Red's messages on it if you need to.

10:25.180 --> 10:28.240
–Sir.
–Ah, good.

10:28.316 --> 10:30.812
There's a flight to Houston
tomorrow at 7:00 a. m.

10:30.852 --> 10:33.946
As in morning, 7:00am?

10:34.022 --> 10:36.081
Yes. That 7:00 a. m.

10:36.157 --> 10:40.093
–For what?
–You have until then to accept.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.857
–Why do I have to go?
–You'll find out when you get there.

10:42.897 --> 10:46.764
–This is whacked.
–You might wanna rethink that.

10:50.270 --> 10:53.834
What could he possibly give me
that he hasn't already taken away?

10:53.874 --> 10:56.900
Huh? Screw him.
Screw both of you.

11:00.914 --> 11:04.008
Well.

11:07.354 --> 11:10.255
How was your day?

11:10.324 --> 11:13.020
I'm not sure.

11:13.093 --> 11:15.925
What do you mean?

11:15.995 --> 11:18.357
My grandfather may have
left me something.

11:18.397 --> 11:21.594
–Yeah?
–I'm just trying to figure it out.

11:21.667 --> 11:25.262
–You mean it's not cash?
–I don't know.

11:25.338 --> 11:27.806
Don't know?

11:27.873 --> 11:31.304
If l want to play into his little power trip,
I gotta go pick it up.

11:31.344 --> 11:33.869
–Where?
–Texas.

11:33.946 --> 11:37.177
–Yech.
–You know what? I'm not going.

11:37.250 --> 11:40.981
Well, aren't you
at least curious?

11:41.053 --> 11:44.181
What if it's… gold?

11:48.693 --> 11:50.684
He ruined my life.

11:50.762 --> 11:53.492
My best revenge
is to just…

11:53.565 --> 11:55.499
ignore him.

11:55.567 --> 11:58.968
Besides,
I've got a trust fund.

11:59.037 --> 12:01.809
Worst-case scenario—
I'll live off my mom.

12:02.407 --> 12:04.398
I don't need his money.

12:04.476 --> 12:07.839
Yeah, but one can always use
some extra walking-around money.

12:07.879 --> 12:11.474
Not if I have
to sell my soul.

12:11.549 --> 12:15.680
But, if you had to, at least try to get
as much out of him as you can.

12:15.720 --> 12:19.415
My gosh. What if you actually
had to get a job sometime?

12:32.303 --> 12:34.669
Police escort— sorta.

12:42.146 --> 12:44.671
Uh, ladies and gentlemen…

12:44.748 --> 12:48.411
from the flight deck, we have a very full flight
to Houston this morning.

12:48.451 --> 12:50.715
Uh, excuse me, sir.

12:50.787 --> 12:53.620
Can I- Can I see
your boarding pass again?

12:55.825 --> 12:57.759
Thank you.

12:57.827 --> 13:00.256
Yeah. See, this is, uh—
I'm sorry. This is for coach.

13:00.296 --> 13:02.230
Nah. That's impossible.

13:02.298 --> 13:06.962
–No. It's, uh, 32B.
–Well, change it.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.937
We can't— Please.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.440
We can't— No.
Thanks a lot.

13:12.508 --> 13:15.238
We can't change it.
It's a “Q” fare. You can't upgrade.

13:15.278 --> 13:18.140
–So, can we—
–Do you have any idea who I am?

13:18.180 --> 13:22.014
I- I know exactly
who you are.

13:22.084 --> 13:25.485
You're the guy in Seat 32B. Here we go.

13:31.860 --> 13:35.159
Conversay to Jason Stevens.

13:35.230 --> 13:39.326
Hello, Jason.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.630
What is this, one of those things
Aunt Martha had to wear?

13:41.670 --> 13:45.367
I see you're at the, uh,
Houston airport.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.374
Uh, Baggage Claim.

13:49.577 --> 13:53.343
You got a problem?

13:53.414 --> 13:56.277
You don't look like you've worked
a day in your life.

13:56.317 --> 13:58.308
Great.
The Amazing Kreskin.

13:58.386 --> 14:01.315
I'm don't know what I'm supposed to be doing,
because no one's been—

14:01.355 --> 14:04.222
Hey! Hey!

14:05.393 --> 14:08.760
I'm Gus.
I'm your ride. Get in.

14:20.573 --> 14:23.002
I'm sorry about
your grandfather's passin'.

14:23.042 --> 14:25.042
He and I go way back.

14:25.445 --> 14:29.176
He was some man.
He loved to work.

14:30.817 --> 14:32.978
The man just loved
hard work.

14:33.052 --> 14:35.953
Right. Mind if I smoke?

14:36.022 --> 14:38.286
Ah, it's a free country.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.189
Can you stop
at the next convenience store?

14:43.229 --> 14:46.198
–Convenience store?
–Please.

14:46.266 --> 14:49.632
The last store was
about 50 miles back.

14:49.701 --> 14:53.535
We've been on my property
for the last 30 minutes or so.

14:58.177 --> 15:00.339
Well, seein' as how
you're Red's grandson…

15:00.379 --> 15:03.644
you'll stay in the main house
with us.

15:03.715 --> 15:07.546
I know it ain't much.
The little lady just wanted a modest place.

15:07.586 --> 15:11.579
Dinner's in an hour.
Breakfast at 5:00.

15:11.657 --> 15:14.091
Uh, Gus?

15:14.159 --> 15:18.255
–Aren't you forgetting something?
–I don't think so. Shoot.

15:18.330 --> 15:21.264
The gift.

15:27.905 --> 15:30.430
So this is hell.

16:10.013 --> 16:13.244
Hey, city boy.
Breakfast is over.

16:13.316 --> 16:16.550
Don't you have some kind
of gizmo to wake you up?

16:17.287 --> 16:20.188
Beat it.

16:32.735 --> 16:36.398
–Good morning.
–What is your problem!

16:47.983 --> 16:51.282
Time to get to work.
The sun'll be up soon.

16:51.353 --> 16:55.482
Man Speaking Spanish ]
–Let's go!

16:58.259 --> 17:00.288
Your granddad and I
started out together…

17:00.328 --> 17:03.320
wild cattin' oil wells
down in Louisiana.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.460
Made some money.
We each bought cattle spreads…

17:05.500 --> 17:08.435
as a hedge against
the oil runnin' out.

17:08.502 --> 17:10.630
Of course,
he really made it.

17:10.704 --> 17:14.598
–Nice to own your own little piece of Texas, right?
–Right.

17:41.635 --> 17:43.569
Just from there—

17:43.637 --> 17:46.071
eight feet
from the center.

17:46.139 --> 17:48.130
What?

17:48.208 --> 17:51.006
Lunch will be sent
'round about 11:00.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.509
Well, how far
am I supposed to go?

17:56.549 --> 17:58.483
Don't worry.

17:58.551 --> 18:01.983
You'll run out of posts
before you run out of Texas.

18:02.521 --> 18:06.283
I wish I had a dollar
for every fence post I've ever set.

18:07.093 --> 18:09.027
Matter of fact, I do.

19:14.858 --> 19:16.758
Hey.

19:20.130 --> 19:22.997
What do you think?

19:30.073 --> 19:32.507
No! Hey!

19:32.575 --> 19:37.274
Aw! Come on, man!

19:37.480 --> 19:40.009
So, I'm dying to know. What did you get?

19:40.049 --> 19:43.143
Uh, it's complicated,
but it involves land…

19:43.219 --> 19:45.915
building materials
and slave labor.

19:45.988 --> 19:47.984
They're giving you
a shopping mall?

19:48.024 --> 19:50.686
Not exactly.

19:50.760 --> 19:53.856
So it must be the land, right?
They're giving that to you?

19:53.896 --> 19:58.160
–Uh, land's got a lot to do with it, yeah.
–You don't sound too sure.

19:58.200 --> 20:02.466
Well, whatever it is, I gotta survive
this geriatric cowboy…

20:02.537 --> 20:06.598
until he gives it to me
or when I get back or—

20:09.111 --> 20:11.045
or when I'm finished.

20:11.113 --> 20:13.047
Finish what?

20:13.115 --> 20:15.544
You know what?
Let me get back to you, okay?

20:15.584 --> 20:18.018
Jason, what are you—

20:19.287 --> 20:21.619
So that's it.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.566
Yeah.

22:07.525 --> 22:09.959
Let's go.

22:10.027 --> 22:12.018
I'm not done.

22:13.264 --> 22:15.255
Work's never done
on a ranch.

22:31.681 --> 22:33.672
All right. Whatever.

23:02.544 --> 23:06.275
You know, you do any work
like you just did…

23:06.348 --> 23:08.908
you can do anything.

23:19.962 --> 23:22.590
Now, aren't you
forgettin' something?

23:22.665 --> 23:26.465
–I don't think so. Shoot.
–The gift.

23:26.535 --> 23:29.367
I came here to pick up a gift.
Remember?

23:35.710 --> 23:38.201
That was the gift?

23:38.279 --> 23:40.543
I do manual labor
for a month…

23:40.615 --> 23:44.381
and you're trying to tell me
it was a favor— to me.

23:44.452 --> 23:46.818
–The gift of work.
–Wow.

23:46.888 --> 23:49.220
–Congratulations.
–Look, Hamilton.

23:49.290 --> 23:53.052
Just tell me what
my total inheritance is. I'm over this.

23:54.829 --> 23:57.403
Where are you going?
Where is he going?

23:57.432 --> 23:59.459
Can you tell him
to come back, please?

23:59.499 --> 24:02.491
Mr Hamilton.
Mr Hamilton.

24:02.569 --> 24:05.060
Hey.

24:05.138 --> 24:07.197
Mr Hamilton, sir.
Please.

24:09.543 --> 24:13.307
I think it's only fair I know the amount
of money we're dealing with here. Don't you?

24:13.347 --> 24:15.281
I've been gone for a month.

24:15.349 --> 24:18.546
Just tell me—
What do I have to do? What is it?

24:18.618 --> 24:21.587
Red said,
“a series of gifts.”

24:21.655 --> 24:24.089
But let me add
a personal note.

24:24.157 --> 24:27.024
I, too, think
this is a waste of time.

24:27.094 --> 24:30.790
But it will end shortly,
because you are going to fail.

24:30.863 --> 24:33.991
I expect you to fail
and to fail miserably.

24:34.066 --> 24:36.128
Now, if you do want
to continue…

24:36.168 --> 24:38.742
make an appointment
with Miss Hastings.

24:40.873 --> 24:44.309
Okay. Look. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mr Hamilton.

24:46.879 --> 24:50.710
I've been acting like a moron
about this whole thing, and I'm sorry.

24:50.750 --> 24:54.246
And now I- I see exactly
what you and Red have in store for me…

24:54.286 --> 24:56.926
and I think
it's exceedingly beneficial.

24:58.124 --> 25:00.114
So, what's the next gift?

25:01.860 --> 25:03.794
You'll know.

25:21.579 --> 25:23.513
Howdy.

25:37.561 --> 25:40.997
Wait! Wait!

25:41.065 --> 25:43.761
That's an $8,000
paint job!

25:47.938 --> 25:50.534
You don't begin to live
until you've lost everything.

25:50.574 --> 25:53.070
Heck, I've lost everything
three or four times.

25:53.110 --> 25:55.704
It's the perfect place
to start.

25:55.779 --> 25:58.043
Now, for most
of your adult life…

25:58.115 --> 26:00.491
you have been
the life of the party…

26:00.517 --> 26:03.917
and an easy touch
for a lot of weak hangers-on.

26:03.986 --> 26:06.682
Now let's see who
your real friends are.

26:09.158 --> 26:12.822
I was at your funeral, and there wasn't
a single person there…

26:12.862 --> 26:17.193
who wasn't on your payroll or didn't
have something to gain from your death.

26:17.233 --> 26:19.895
What exactly is he
asking me to do?

26:19.969 --> 26:23.269
He wants you to come back
at the end of the month…

26:23.339 --> 26:25.466
with one true friend.

26:32.114 --> 26:35.481
Thank you.

26:37.519 --> 26:41.421
–And how were the lobster tails?
–It was fine, thanks.

26:41.490 --> 26:43.932
The lady was enjoying
the Montrachet.

26:48.663 --> 26:50.893
And sir, the Margaux.

26:50.966 --> 26:52.894
I hope it met
your expectations.

26:52.934 --> 26:55.095
It was terrific.
Thank you.

26:55.170 --> 26:59.834
We don't get too many requests
for the '78.

26:59.908 --> 27:02.943
It's a bit too pricey
for some of our patrons.

27:06.981 --> 27:09.291
I'll just leave this
with you then.

27:13.220 --> 27:16.781
Caitlin, where do you
see our relationship?

27:18.125 --> 27:22.118
–What are you asking me, Jason Stevens?
–Just thinking.

27:22.196 --> 27:24.994
How long have we
been going out?

27:25.065 --> 27:27.829
Uh, an appropriate
amount of time.

27:27.902 --> 27:30.231
–Long enough.
–See? My thoughts exactly.

27:30.271 --> 27:34.900
I was thinking that maybe
it's time to take us… more seriously.

27:34.974 --> 27:36.737
Yes?

27:36.809 --> 27:39.739
But there's something
I want to ask you first.

27:39.779 --> 27:43.643
Jason, if you're talking about a prenup,
isn't that sort of passé?

27:43.683 --> 27:46.379
Well, see, I'm in—
I was thinking—

27:46.452 --> 27:48.784
Excuse me, sir.

27:48.855 --> 27:51.384
The charge card company
declined the charge.

27:51.424 --> 27:55.188
That's impossible. I don't have a credit limit.
Just run it through again.

27:55.228 --> 27:58.686
It's always our practice
to run it through again…

27:58.765 --> 28:00.756
but they declined.

28:03.502 --> 28:05.436
Okay.

28:05.504 --> 28:08.564
So, I was thinking, um…

28:08.640 --> 28:12.804
well, maybe, it'd be a good time
for me to move in with you.

28:12.878 --> 28:16.775
Uh, you move in with me?
Why? Half my wardrobe's at your penthouse.

28:16.815 --> 28:20.679
Just for a change of scenery.
Besides, I'm remodeling my place.

28:20.719 --> 28:24.383
A remodel? But— Who's your designer?
I know everyone in town.

28:24.423 --> 28:27.324
I should've said
I'm beginning to remodel.

28:27.392 --> 28:30.362
I've only really started
with the demolition.

28:31.663 --> 28:35.063
I'm sorry, sir.
Your bank is on the line.

28:35.132 --> 28:37.195
They'd really like
to speak with you. I must insist.

28:37.235 --> 28:39.363
Look, guys. I'm having
a little bit of a setback.

28:39.403 --> 28:42.307
It's nothing that can't be fixed.
All right?

28:45.509 --> 28:49.969
Sweetie, I'm switching accounts right now…

28:50.047 --> 28:53.107
and I'm…
temporarily out of money.

28:53.184 --> 28:55.692
Is there a way
you could pay for this?

29:02.126 --> 29:04.787
Jason, you're, um—

29:06.429 --> 29:08.420
You're, uh…

29:10.734 --> 29:13.328
asking me
to pay the bill?

29:13.403 --> 29:16.236
It's—

29:24.447 --> 29:25.447
You owe me.

29:26.516 --> 29:29.144
What?

29:29.219 --> 29:31.551
Yo, dude,
I'm rollin' over.

29:31.621 --> 29:33.555
What do you mean
I can't?

29:33.623 --> 29:37.058
I have been there for you
countless times.

29:37.126 --> 29:39.388
You owe me. That's it.
Bottom line.

29:39.428 --> 29:41.724
Who was the one who loaned you
10 grand last year?

29:41.764 --> 29:44.360
I could come up with a better excuse
when I was 12 years old.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.463
All I need is a place to sleep.
I don't get what the problem is.

29:47.503 --> 29:50.232
You can let me spend the night.
One night. Hello?

29:50.272 --> 29:52.801
Sorry. Your service has been disconnected.

29:52.841 --> 29:56.339
–Can I help you? Yeah, shut up.
–No. Nothing, thanks.

30:05.953 --> 30:07.887
Jason.

30:07.955 --> 30:10.082
Um— Uh,
what a surprise.

30:10.158 --> 30:14.622
–Mom, you're never gonna believe this.
–I'm afraid I can't let you in.

30:14.662 --> 30:17.058
I'm having a bit of a situation.
I need some help.

30:17.098 --> 30:21.062
–I need to borrow some money.
–Of course you do. Everyone needs money.

30:21.102 --> 30:23.332
Uh—

30:23.404 --> 30:26.771
Didn't your grandfather
leave you anything?

30:26.841 --> 30:29.137
What are you talking about?
He hated me.

30:29.177 --> 30:31.145
Jason, he did not.

30:31.212 --> 30:35.610
He didn't come around much, but, uh,
I always thought it was because of me.

30:35.650 --> 30:37.811
It doesn't matter.
Do you have any extra spending cash?

30:37.851 --> 30:40.979
I would love
to help you.

30:41.054 --> 30:43.420
–But I can't.
–You can't?

30:43.490 --> 30:46.553
They told me specifically that you would be
comin' around for money…

30:46.593 --> 30:48.622
and that I was not
to give you anything.

30:48.662 --> 30:51.658
But I'm your son, Mom.
That's what you're supposed to do.

30:51.698 --> 30:54.360
If l violate
their instructions…

30:54.434 --> 30:57.801
I am out everything—
everything.

30:57.871 --> 31:00.567
So for the sake
of the greater good…

31:00.640 --> 31:03.074
I must insist
that you leave.

31:03.143 --> 31:05.172
I'm not gonna upset
the whole applecart…

31:05.212 --> 31:07.473
just because you're facing
a few challenges.

31:07.513 --> 31:11.415
I'm sorry. I just
cannot help you.

31:11.484 --> 31:13.748
Thanks.

31:29.568 --> 31:32.662
Ow!

31:52.824 --> 31:55.266
Hey, man. You're—
You're on my bench.

31:58.463 --> 32:00.454
You're on my bench.

32:01.866 --> 32:03.800
Beat it.

32:03.868 --> 32:07.735
–A simple “no” would have sufficed.
–Fine. No.

32:07.805 --> 32:11.536
–No, what?
–No, you cannot sit on this bench.

32:11.608 --> 32:13.804
This is not your bench.
This is a city bench.

32:13.844 --> 32:16.904
–Go sit on another bench.
–But it's my bench.

32:16.980 --> 32:19.309
I've got just as much
right to it as anybody.

32:19.349 --> 32:21.817
It's a free country, you know.

32:21.885 --> 32:23.847
See, that's where
you're wrong.

32:23.887 --> 32:26.216
Name one thing
in this country that's for free.

32:26.256 --> 32:29.219
You need money for everything.
Without money, you're nothing.

32:29.259 --> 32:31.693
Look at you.
No money. No food.

32:31.762 --> 32:33.757
No family. No friends.
Nothing.

32:33.797 --> 32:36.664
Besides, I'm sitting
on this bench now.

32:36.733 --> 32:38.893
This is my bench.
Okay?

32:42.305 --> 32:45.206
I'll flip you for it.

32:45.274 --> 32:47.242
Fine.

32:56.986 --> 33:00.080
I have a quarter.

33:01.491 --> 33:03.482
Thanks.

33:08.930 --> 33:12.331
Oh.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.369
Well, aren't you gonna
chase him for it?

33:15.437 --> 33:17.928
Beat it, kid.

33:18.006 --> 33:20.902
I've been watching you.
You're not a real bum.

33:20.942 --> 33:24.469
We saw you at a funeral.
Quite the entrance.

33:26.181 --> 33:29.344
–What were you doing at—
–My mother and I come here for lunch every day.

33:29.384 --> 33:32.180
Except, right now,
she doesn't know where I am.

33:32.220 --> 33:35.451
–Emily!
–Whatever.

33:35.524 --> 33:38.960
Emily!
Oh! Emily.

33:39.027 --> 33:42.623
–You must really be having a bad life.
–Come on. Right now.

33:42.663 --> 33:45.793
I was just having a pleasant conversation
with this gentleman.

33:45.833 --> 33:50.130
–Leave us alone, please.
–Dear, don't be ridiculous.
Sorry to disturb you. Come on.

33:50.170 --> 33:52.366
That's okay. I'm not the one
who's disturbed.

33:52.406 --> 33:54.374
Some friend you are.

33:54.441 --> 33:56.375
Thanks a lot, poser.

33:56.443 --> 33:58.606
You know what I've said
about talking to strangers.

33:58.646 --> 34:02.009
–He's not a real bum.
–Hey. Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

34:02.049 --> 34:04.912
Okay, this is gonna sound
really, really strange…

34:04.952 --> 34:07.381
but I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

34:07.421 --> 34:10.216
I'll make a deal with you.
I need a friend.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.850
But only for a little while,
and, uh…

34:12.926 --> 34:17.862
in return, I don't know,
I'll take you both to Disneyworld.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.831
Excuse me?

34:20.900 --> 34:24.301
–I need a friend.
–Explain yourself.

34:24.370 --> 34:28.170
–It's complicated.
–No, it's not.

34:28.241 --> 34:30.607
It's pathetic.

34:30.677 --> 34:33.373
–Come on. Now, just because—
–Mom, I told you.

34:33.413 --> 34:36.712
–He's not a real bum.
–Okay.

34:36.783 --> 34:39.217
Oh, dude, come on.

34:59.438 --> 35:02.407
She doesn't even like
Châteauneuf du Pape.

35:05.611 --> 35:09.611
Thank you.

35:09.881 --> 35:13.179
Miss Hastings,
bring me the Stevens file.

35:13.250 --> 35:16.547
Looks like our boy's not even
gonna make it through round two.

35:16.587 --> 35:18.714
But, sir…

35:18.789 --> 35:22.247
doesn't he have until
the end of today?

35:22.326 --> 35:24.260
Well, from what I hear…

35:24.328 --> 35:28.156
he could have another month
and still get the same result.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.559
Yes, sir.

35:31.636 --> 35:35.266
–So, what do you think? Is this a good spot?
–Yeah, perfect.

35:35.306 --> 35:37.902
You can see everything
under the perfect tree.

35:37.942 --> 35:40.605
–Hey! Hey! Give that back!
–I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm just hungry.

35:40.645 --> 35:43.139
–Sir, you need to step back.
–Don't you have a sandwich?

35:43.179 --> 35:45.208
–You need to step back.
–Leave her alone.

35:45.248 --> 35:47.744
Get back! Get back!
I've got 911 all dialed in.

35:47.784 --> 35:50.113
All I have to do is press “Send.”
Sweetheart, get back.

35:50.153 --> 35:53.350
–Ow! No!
–Hey! Hey! Leave 'em alone.

36:02.265 --> 36:04.199
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

36:04.267 --> 36:07.600
Whoo! Yeah.

36:07.671 --> 36:09.764
My bench.

36:12.107 --> 36:14.007
Mwah!

36:14.276 --> 36:17.803
–So, you have a bet with a dead guy?
–Mm-hmm.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.815
–Cool.
–Emily. Be polite.

36:20.883 --> 36:24.279
Wait. How can you have a bet with a…
deceased person?

36:24.319 --> 36:26.782
See, that's the part
that's complicated.

36:26.822 --> 36:29.256
So you come up
with a friend.

36:29.324 --> 36:32.384
What do you get if we
go along with this?

36:32.461 --> 36:36.488
–Emily.
–No, it's okay. I don't know.

36:36.565 --> 36:40.365
Something about an ultimate gift
or something.

36:40.436 --> 36:42.463
But you're not sure
what that is.

36:42.503 --> 36:44.801
Yeah, that about
sums it up.

36:44.872 --> 36:47.602
So what do we get
if we agree to do this?

36:47.675 --> 36:51.577
–We need money. How much are you willing to pay?
–Emily!

36:51.646 --> 36:55.082
I'm sorry. You're gonna
have to excuse my daughter.

36:55.149 --> 36:58.585
Sometimes she tends to be
a little outspoken.

37:02.557 --> 37:04.491
I can't promise you anything.

37:07.161 --> 37:09.186
Now, that's better.

37:09.263 --> 37:12.562
But what if
we really did…

37:14.601 --> 37:16.796
become friends?

37:29.182 --> 37:31.616
–Emily, it's not polite—
–Shh.

37:38.792 --> 37:43.126
–So you're Jason's friend?
–Yes, I am.

37:44.530 --> 37:47.124
–True friend?
–Absolutely.

37:47.199 --> 37:48.894
Pinky promise.

37:48.968 --> 37:51.542
So, how long have you
known Mr Stevens?

37:51.604 --> 37:55.506
We go way back.
We're like this.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.700
Now, where do I sign?

37:59.812 --> 38:02.906
And, uh…

38:02.982 --> 38:06.378
he hasn't promised you
any compensation for this friendship?

38:06.418 --> 38:08.409
Look at him.

38:08.487 --> 38:11.718
Does he look like
he has anything to offer?

38:13.626 --> 38:15.752
So, uh…

38:18.062 --> 38:20.997
you expect this friendship
to continue?

38:21.065 --> 38:24.592
I plan on knowing Jason
for the rest of my life.

38:33.144 --> 38:36.576
Tomorrow— lunch at noon,
our usual spot in the park.

38:36.581 --> 38:39.277
Sure.

38:41.419 --> 38:43.387
Just a minute, pal!

38:43.454 --> 38:45.717
You owe me.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.962
Emily. Wait.

38:56.767 --> 38:59.895
They go back a long way, don't they?

38:59.970 --> 39:04.430
There was a time when Mr Hamilton
was quite ill…

39:04.508 --> 39:06.772
and needed
a kidney transplant.

39:06.844 --> 39:12.009
Your grandfather went out of his way
to help him find a donor.

39:12.082 --> 39:15.111
You could even say, I think,
that Mr Hamilton's alive today…

39:15.151 --> 39:17.085
because of Red Stevens.

39:20.556 --> 39:22.490
Um.

39:24.260 --> 39:26.622
In the, um, basement
of this building…

39:26.662 --> 39:29.058
there's a small apartment
for a custodian.

39:29.098 --> 39:31.078
It isn't being used right now.

39:31.100 --> 39:34.070
Perhaps you'd, um, like
to take a look at it?

39:38.040 --> 39:39.974
Thank you.

39:40.042 --> 39:44.002
Jason, you have no concept whatsoever
of the value of money.

39:44.046 --> 39:48.812
Money has always been available to you,
like the air you breathe.

39:48.884 --> 39:53.240
I tell you, let's, uh, review some highlights
of your recent past.

39:55.957 --> 40:00.326
A $25,000-per-night suite
in Paris…

40:00.395 --> 40:04.525
with a personal chef
whom you tipped heavily.

40:04.599 --> 40:08.196
Toured the Bordeaux region
in chauffeured hot-air balloons.

40:08.236 --> 40:10.466
That was amazing.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.968
A week of heli-skiing
in Saint Moritz.

40:13.008 --> 40:15.272
A small fleet
of exotic cars.

40:15.343 --> 40:18.641
The latest in everything,
including women.

40:20.014 --> 40:22.141
But the past is the past…

40:22.216 --> 40:25.780
and I figure you've probably had
a pretty tough month.

40:30.024 --> 40:33.289
Well, it's about time.
Thank you very much.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.828
And if l ever
see you two again…

40:35.896 --> 40:37.830
it'll be too soon.

40:52.245 --> 40:55.041
Well, seeing how you've never
held one of those before…

40:55.081 --> 40:57.015
let me explain what it is.

40:57.083 --> 41:00.914
That's a paycheck.
That's for what you earned at Gus's ranch.

41:00.954 --> 41:03.616
Of course, the I. R. S. ravaged it first.
I hate those guys.

41:03.656 --> 41:05.685
In your pocket
every step of the way.

41:05.725 --> 41:08.855
You start out in business,
and then you have to make a payroll.

41:08.895 --> 41:10.924
And just when you think
you're gonna make a—

41:10.964 --> 41:13.660
Mr Stevens, this is
the “Gift of Money,” please.

41:13.700 --> 41:17.226
Yeah, all right. Sorry.
Look at me.

41:17.302 --> 41:22.740
I'm carrying on about death and taxes
even after I'm dead.

41:22.808 --> 41:26.305
Now, you have to take that money and‐
as much as you need it yourself—

41:26.345 --> 41:29.803
spend it on someone
experiencing a real problem.

41:29.881 --> 41:31.940
What can they teach you?

41:32.017 --> 41:34.247
Put yourself
in their shoes.

41:34.319 --> 41:37.447
Jason, would you like us
to cash it for you?

41:37.522 --> 41:39.456
Please.

41:40.525 --> 41:42.755
I think we know you
well enough…

41:42.828 --> 41:45.524
that we won't need
any I. D.

41:45.597 --> 41:47.791
How will you know
how I spent it?

41:50.601 --> 41:52.569
We'll know.

42:01.812 --> 42:03.746
Hey.

42:04.982 --> 42:06.916
I didn't
take anything.

42:06.984 --> 42:09.475
Nothin'. Nothin'.

42:21.998 --> 42:23.932
Oh, no.

42:25.168 --> 42:27.898
Great.

42:56.498 --> 42:58.489
Naturally.

42:58.567 --> 43:00.629
A young blonde woman
and her little girl.

43:00.669 --> 43:02.660
–Just down the hall.
–Thanks.

43:02.738 --> 43:04.729
Paging Dr Howard. Dr Howard.

43:04.807 --> 43:08.072
Paging Dr Kline.
Dr Kline.

43:08.143 --> 43:10.134
Paging Dr Howard.

43:33.234 --> 43:36.032
What are you doing here?

43:38.239 --> 43:40.673
–You saw her.
–Yeah.

43:40.741 --> 43:42.572
Did you talk to her?

43:47.815 --> 43:50.586
–So, what's wrong with her?
–That depends.

43:50.650 --> 43:52.828
–On what?
–On who you really are.

43:54.588 --> 43:56.579
Maybe I can help you.

43:58.258 --> 44:00.920
Emily has leukemia.

44:00.994 --> 44:03.857
We thought she was in remission after
her bone marrow transplant…

44:03.897 --> 44:06.866
but a couple of weeks ago—

44:06.933 --> 44:09.705
her body started
to reject the transplant.

44:13.140 --> 44:16.200
I'm sorry.

44:19.546 --> 44:21.479
Uh, hey.

44:22.715 --> 44:25.707
Uh, well, you gotta
need money, right?

44:25.784 --> 44:29.181
Oh, so that's it. You won your bet
with your rich grandfather.

44:29.221 --> 44:31.984
You're back off the streets.
Congratulations. What is it now?

44:32.024 --> 44:34.788
Uh, I do have
to give away some money.

44:34.860 --> 44:38.762
You're getting less mysterious
by the minute.

44:38.831 --> 44:41.694
I bet you're gonna get to the end
of your game, collect your cash…

44:41.734 --> 44:44.263
–and just ride off into the sunset.
–I don't know. Maybe.

44:44.303 --> 44:48.364
But, Alexia, if l can help you,
why won't you just let me?

44:48.440 --> 44:52.569
Because no… rich kid
is gonna use me or my daughter…

44:52.644 --> 44:54.578
to play a game.

45:06.491 --> 45:09.585
She owes $1,600
in back rent. Pay it.

45:11.563 --> 45:16.626
You're a hundred dollars short.
Your check was for 1,500.

45:16.701 --> 45:20.262
Tell Hamilton I'm good for it.
Just pay that bill.

45:25.008 --> 45:29.502
Your other hundred.

45:29.580 --> 45:31.946
Well, push “Play.”

45:32.149 --> 45:35.179
Our lives should be lived
not avoiding problems…

45:35.219 --> 45:39.212
but welcoming them as challenges
that will strengthen us…

45:39.289 --> 45:42.656
so that we can be
victorious in the future.

45:42.726 --> 45:47.791
So, now that I've given you the gift of work
and friends and the value of money…

45:47.831 --> 45:49.860
let's discover
the gift of family.

45:49.900 --> 45:51.891
Now this is a tough one…

45:51.968 --> 45:54.363
but see if it's even
remotely possible…

45:54.403 --> 45:57.266
to get something positive
out of our family.

45:57.306 --> 46:00.738
See if they truly know
how to count their blessings.

46:01.911 --> 46:03.873
I f my doctors
are remotely accurate…

46:03.913 --> 46:06.475
this assignment might even
fall on Thanksgiving.

46:06.515 --> 46:09.006
How appropriate.

46:09.085 --> 46:12.111
He's joking, right?

46:15.358 --> 46:18.521
Dr Allen, you're wanted in O.B.

46:18.594 --> 46:21.791
Dr Allen, please report
to Obstetrics.

46:21.864 --> 46:24.957
–Hey, where's the girl?
–Who, Emily?

46:25.033 --> 46:26.967
She's with God.

46:33.808 --> 46:37.209
Oh, there's my best friend.

46:39.180 --> 46:41.375
Listen, about the other day—

46:44.019 --> 46:47.955
So, now you know
all about me.

46:49.024 --> 46:51.925
No more mysteries.

46:51.993 --> 46:55.519
–Look, I'm really sorry.
–Shut up.

46:55.596 --> 46:57.587
Don't be pathetic.

47:00.401 --> 47:02.463
I wonder if he takes
advance orders.

47:02.503 --> 47:05.370
For what?

47:05.439 --> 47:07.964
For my place.

47:08.042 --> 47:10.567
You know, up there.

47:10.644 --> 47:13.545
What do you think
it's gonna be like?

47:13.614 --> 47:15.844
Butterflies.

47:15.916 --> 47:18.043
Lots of butterflies.

47:19.119 --> 47:22.384
Did you know, God…

47:22.456 --> 47:25.821
paints every color on a butterfly
with his fingers.

47:26.592 --> 47:29.760
I didn't know you thought about
stuff like that.

47:31.264 --> 47:34.529
I think about dying.

47:34.600 --> 47:38.468
There's something basically unfair
about a person dying.

47:40.206 --> 47:42.197
I even hate the idea.

47:47.480 --> 47:49.914
You know, I, uh—

47:49.982 --> 47:52.028
I don't know much
about God or—

47:53.386 --> 47:56.047
or Jesus.

47:56.121 --> 47:59.817
But I can promise you that those arms
are meant for you.

48:04.363 --> 48:06.991
What's gonna happen
to my mom?

48:07.065 --> 48:09.309
I really don't hate her,
you know.

48:24.549 --> 48:26.607
Did I mention…

48:29.086 --> 48:31.594
I wouldn't be upset
if you kissed her?

48:36.494 --> 48:39.054
Do you think
your mom and I—

48:39.130 --> 48:41.189
Okay. It's official.

48:41.265 --> 48:44.496
You are the slowest person I have ever met.

48:44.568 --> 48:47.298
You two were made
for each other.

48:47.371 --> 48:49.305
I knew that
back in the park.

48:49.373 --> 48:52.970
–In the park, I looked like a bum.
–Let's not be delusional.

48:53.010 --> 48:55.637
You were a bum.

48:55.712 --> 49:00.809
So, what are you doing
for Thanksgiving?

49:06.055 --> 49:08.717
–Mrs Drummond?
–Yes.

49:08.792 --> 49:12.522
I want to send Emily's charts and blood work
off to a specialist—

49:12.562 --> 49:16.522
see whether or not she's a candidate
for another transplant.

49:17.066 --> 49:21.230
Oh. Uh, will that give her
a better chance than chemo?

49:23.139 --> 49:26.665
Unfortunately, chemotherapy
isn't going to be enough.

49:28.977 --> 49:31.104
I'm sorry.

49:31.180 --> 49:33.114
Thank you.

50:19.160 --> 50:22.891
So when I found out
I was pregnant…

50:22.964 --> 50:26.899
he was getting ready
to leave for college and, uh…

50:26.967 --> 50:29.541
didn't want anything
to get in his way.

50:31.438 --> 50:35.602
And Emily— she's—

50:38.245 --> 50:40.736
she's the best decision
I ever made.

50:45.018 --> 50:48.681
So, apparently…

50:48.755 --> 50:51.747
someone came by
and covered my back rent.

50:53.727 --> 50:56.719
Was it you?

50:56.796 --> 50:58.592
Thank you.

51:02.001 --> 51:05.464
I have a question for you,
and I hope I'm not being out of line here.

51:05.504 --> 51:07.933
I was wondering if you'd like
to join me for Thanksgiving.

51:07.973 --> 51:10.999
Oh. Um, thanks.

51:11.076 --> 51:13.572
That's nice of you to ask,
but I can't.

51:13.612 --> 51:18.481
Um, obviously, Emily needs me here, so—
But thanks.

51:18.551 --> 51:20.579
Well, it's too bad,
because you’re missing out…

51:20.619 --> 51:24.248
on a splendid example
of a way-too-wealthy American…

51:24.323 --> 51:26.621
dysfunctional thing.

51:26.692 --> 51:29.091
–It's— Yeah.
–Oh.

51:29.160 --> 51:33.318
You know, I have the strangest feeling
I might have enjoyed it.

51:38.970 --> 51:41.302
What are you
thinking about?

51:41.372 --> 51:43.306
Nothin'.

51:43.374 --> 51:46.138
You're thinking
about Jason.

51:57.922 --> 51:59.855
Yeah. He's weird, isn't he?

51:59.923 --> 52:01.914
He's a good weird.

52:03.226 --> 52:05.660
You know, he, uh, invited me…

52:05.729 --> 52:08.493
over to Thanksgiving
with his family.

52:09.900 --> 52:13.926
–Oh, really?
–Yeah. Of course, I told him, “Whatever, loser.”

52:15.672 --> 52:19.665
–I think you should go.
–Absolutely not.

52:22.412 --> 52:26.075
I wouldn't dream of missing
Thanksgiving with you.

52:28.918 --> 52:31.182
So why'd you decide to come?

52:31.253 --> 52:35.690
–My daughter banished me.
–Oh.

52:35.758 --> 52:38.022
So I have you by decree.

52:38.094 --> 52:40.654
Mmm, knowing Emily—
by design.

52:40.730 --> 52:42.664
Mission accomplished.

52:42.732 --> 52:44.893
Two completely
opposite people…

52:44.967 --> 52:47.396
who wouldn't have had
a chance without me…

52:47.436 --> 52:49.961
destined to make
each other miserable.

52:55.778 --> 52:58.508
You okay, Jason?

52:58.581 --> 53:02.012
Oh. Don't tell me
you've never been on a bus before.

53:16.164 --> 53:18.098
Wow.

53:18.166 --> 53:20.293
Brace yourself.

53:20.368 --> 53:23.667
Jason, seriously.

53:23.738 --> 53:28.952
–I'm willing to bet that they are perfectly normal people.
–Oh, yeah? How much?

53:46.994 --> 53:49.994
This is nice.

53:52.066 --> 53:54.000
Thank you.

53:54.068 --> 53:58.164
You know, I had my firm
do an informal audit—

53:58.238 --> 54:01.764
just the financials
of the publicly held side.

54:01.841 --> 54:05.669
And there's still
several hundred million floatin' around.

54:06.546 --> 54:08.508
Well, you knew him better than I.

54:08.548 --> 54:12.040
Most of those companies
were privately held.

54:12.118 --> 54:15.348
Maybe we should check into
some of his favorite charities.

54:15.388 --> 54:18.351
–They do have to report large contributions.
–That's a great idea.

54:18.391 --> 54:21.485
Daddy always was a sucker
for a begging hand.

54:21.561 --> 54:26.157
Hmm. Unfortunately,
you're right.

54:26.232 --> 54:30.163
And what sort of business
does your family come from, Alexia?

54:30.203 --> 54:33.069
Um, health care.

54:33.138 --> 54:35.265
Oh, how wonderful.

54:35.340 --> 54:37.869
Well, we have a wing
in the hospital downtown.

54:37.909 --> 54:39.843
A couple of wings, I think.

54:39.911 --> 54:41.873
Or is it
a couple of hospitals?

54:41.913 --> 54:44.347
I always forget.

54:44.416 --> 54:47.145
My daughter is receiving great care
thanks to your father.

54:47.185 --> 54:49.619
Great sector-health care.

54:49.688 --> 54:53.488
Little flat in the third quarter,
but poised to rocket.

54:53.558 --> 54:56.686
Okay. I'd like to propose a toast.

54:56.762 --> 55:01.028
Yes. To each other.

55:01.099 --> 55:05.364
For suffering through a year
of great adjustment.

55:05.436 --> 55:07.529
Uh, excuse me.

55:07.605 --> 55:09.900
Does anyone else seem to notice
it smells a little like—

55:09.940 --> 55:12.465
cowhide in here?

55:12.543 --> 55:17.640
And how are those
sin stocks of yours doing, Jack?

55:17.715 --> 55:20.878
What's wrong with a little
investment in alcohol, tobacco and firearms?

55:20.918 --> 55:26.185
–Over the stench of oil?
–And what's wrong with oil, Thank you very much?

55:26.257 --> 55:29.887
My money's just as
green in Manhattan as anywhere else.

55:31.829 --> 55:36.993
So, who does get
the rest of the estate?

55:38.334 --> 55:40.632
Sarah?

55:40.703 --> 55:44.434
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

55:44.507 --> 55:47.670
Well, you were
the last one in there.

55:47.744 --> 55:51.441
–No, I wasn't.
–Well, that's just ridiculous, darling.

55:51.514 --> 55:53.777
When we left, you were
the only one there.

55:53.817 --> 55:58.584
Well, Jason was also there.

55:59.956 --> 56:02.753
–Ah. Jason.
–Do enlighten us, Jason.

56:02.825 --> 56:04.920
You certainly could not
have been the one…

56:04.960 --> 56:07.534
that received the bulk
of Red's estate.

56:07.596 --> 56:11.960
–Or are you? –Is that why you insisted
we get together for Thanksgiving—

56:12.000 --> 56:15.330
so you could reveal
your newly enhanced trust fund to us?

56:15.370 --> 56:19.868
It's Thanksgiving. I was hoping
maybe we could all go around the table…

56:19.908 --> 56:23.340
and each say something
that we're most thankful for.

56:27.850 --> 56:30.284
–Are you on crack, Jason?
–Again?

56:32.354 --> 56:34.583
Well, here's a thanks.

56:34.655 --> 56:37.985
We don't have to put up with Dad's endless
litany of clichéd quotes this season.

56:38.025 --> 56:40.960
Or hand-spun,
cornpone wisdom.

56:41.028 --> 56:44.028
Hear! Hear!

56:44.131 --> 56:46.531
Who is that?

56:46.601 --> 56:48.663
I think he works
down at the video store.

56:48.703 --> 56:53.197
Well, Jason will tell you
all you need to know about this man…

56:53.274 --> 56:56.710
this… dearly departed.

56:56.777 --> 56:58.773
I mean, he more
than anyone here…

56:58.813 --> 57:01.776
has a bone to pick
with the late, great Red Stevens.

57:01.816 --> 57:05.808
Jason, I can only imagine
what you've just been through.

57:05.886 --> 57:09.883
–I could never get them to be thankful for anything 
either.
–What have you got?

57:09.923 --> 57:12.101
–Hey!
–What in the world is that?

57:12.158 --> 57:16.492
–All right, give it back.
–Pass it to me. Come on.

57:16.563 --> 57:19.203
–Give it back!
–… and if you do succeed…

57:19.266 --> 57:23.296
–Here Take it!
–you'll be one step closer to all I have for you.

57:23.336 --> 57:26.032
What's “all I have for you”?

57:26.106 --> 57:28.635
It's between him and me.
It's none of your business.

57:28.675 --> 57:32.543
It has everything to do with us.
It's our money!

57:32.612 --> 57:35.241
So he's making you work
for your inheritance?

57:35.281 --> 57:38.978
Not anymore, 'cause I don't
think I could ever win at this one.

57:39.018 --> 57:41.543
Alexia, let's go.

57:42.621 --> 57:46.387
–Jason. Wait. Wait!
–Don't!

57:46.458 --> 57:48.487
Just tell them
what they want to hear.

57:48.527 --> 57:50.837
I don't have
to tell them anything.

57:50.896 --> 57:54.226
Jason, you're gonna hear
from my attorney Monday morning.

57:54.266 --> 57:56.530
–Yeah. Ditto.
–Shut up, Jack.

57:58.771 --> 58:00.762
You're all pathetic.

58:02.741 --> 58:06.039
Wait.
Jason, slow down.

58:06.110 --> 58:09.476
I put up with that for years.
I was a part of that.

58:12.317 --> 58:15.286
What happened
to your dad?

58:15.353 --> 58:18.151
He's dead. What else
do you want to know?

58:19.157 --> 58:21.091
How'd he die?

58:21.159 --> 58:25.053
The only person who really knows
just took it to his grave.

58:25.496 --> 58:28.726
Jason, there's something
I always want you to remember, okay?

58:28.766 --> 58:31.029
When I met you,
you were a homeless person.

58:31.069 --> 58:34.402
And you made friends
with my daughter.

58:34.472 --> 58:36.833
We shared
peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches.

58:36.873 --> 58:40.570
All this without me knowing
anything about your background.

58:40.610 --> 58:45.274
Yeah, well, the problem is,
that's me back there.

58:45.349 --> 58:49.843
Yeah, but you can walk away from all that.
You already have.

58:49.920 --> 58:53.788
I appreciate what you're saying,
but money changes things.

58:53.857 --> 58:58.294
It gets you stuff. It's a- It's a way
to live life worry free.

58:58.362 --> 59:02.322
–Money takes away the worry.
–Yeah, I saw what money can do.

59:03.633 --> 59:05.567
And your worries—

59:05.635 --> 59:08.626
or whatever
you want to call them—

59:08.704 --> 59:10.666
they're not
life or death, Jason.

59:10.706 --> 59:14.603
Okay, I'm sorry, but my getting
my inheritance is a matter of life or death.

59:14.643 --> 59:17.506
And I know when I say that,
I sound like I'm being a Stevens…

59:17.546 --> 59:19.508
and being a Stevens
is all about money.

59:19.548 --> 59:21.482
But it's not.
It's more.

59:33.996 --> 59:37.453
So, I'll pay you back
as soon as possible.

59:39.434 --> 59:41.425
What?

59:42.937 --> 59:45.303
Uh, the money I owe you—
the 1,600.

59:49.110 --> 59:51.101
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:00:15.941 --> 01:00:17.932
Marietta Ruby.

01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:24.079
From the time I met her
in the seventh grade…

01:00:24.148 --> 01:00:26.308
that was my sweetheart.

01:00:27.584 --> 01:00:29.630
She didn't
make it easy though.

01:00:29.686 --> 01:00:33.082
Took me all the way till the eighth grade
to catch up with her.

01:00:33.122 --> 01:00:35.522
She's beautiful.

01:00:35.591 --> 01:00:37.524
Yeah.

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:40.788
She passed away
shortly after we were married.

01:00:43.397 --> 01:00:45.388
I'm really sorry.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.994
The greatest gift
she gave me…

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:53.936
was the will to move on…

01:00:54.005 --> 01:00:55.996
to overcome.

01:00:58.743 --> 01:01:01.711
You know, I may have
met someone myself.

01:01:01.779 --> 01:01:05.237
Then cherish her.

01:01:05.316 --> 01:01:08.715
And become
the man she deserves.

01:01:12.387 --> 01:01:14.377
Have a seat.

01:01:15.856 --> 01:01:17.790
Now, as I said…

01:01:17.858 --> 01:01:21.156
I had a feeling
you were gonna stop by.

01:01:24.464 --> 01:01:29.162
That university you attended—
What was it rated? Number three?

01:01:29.234 --> 01:01:31.940
Number-three party school
in the country.

01:01:32.837 --> 01:01:36.102
Do- Do you truly
knowhow to learn?

01:01:36.174 --> 01:01:39.040
Jason, any process
worth going through…

01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:42.043
will get tougher
before it gets easier.

01:01:42.111 --> 01:01:45.512
That's what makes
learning a gift…

01:01:45.581 --> 01:01:47.571
even if pain
is your teacher.

01:02:10.334 --> 01:02:12.598
No. There's no way.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:15.604
Anywhere but there.

01:02:15.672 --> 01:02:18.234
I know what he's trying to do,
and it's not gonna work.

01:02:18.274 --> 01:02:20.636
He can take his millions
to his grave. I don't care.

01:02:20.676 --> 01:02:24.966
What he's trying to do is for your benefit,
not your destruction.

01:02:26.015 --> 01:02:28.643
You know, Hamilton,
you sound just like him.

01:02:28.683 --> 01:02:31.015
But guess what.
You're not him.

01:02:32.086 --> 01:02:34.246
I don't know, son.

01:02:34.321 --> 01:02:36.619
I do have one of his kidneys.

01:02:39.459 --> 01:02:41.948
He's been out there for hours.

01:02:42.027 --> 01:02:44.733
Yep. He's got some big decisions to make.

01:02:44.763 --> 01:02:48.198
Do you think he'll
come in or go home?

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:53.125
He doesn't have a home.

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:56.694
You're right! She hates you!

01:02:58.074 --> 01:03:01.804
–I know.
–Then why are you here?

01:03:01.877 --> 01:03:04.206
I have to leave the country
for a while.

01:03:04.246 --> 01:03:06.641
I'm reluctant to go because
of what I'm leaving behind.

01:03:06.681 --> 01:03:08.911
What are you leaving behind?

01:03:15.254 --> 01:03:18.917
Then you have to go.
Now get out of here.

01:03:20.958 --> 01:03:23.021
You screwed up big time,
you know!

01:03:23.061 --> 01:03:28.362
I had to eat a rubber hospital
turkey for Thanksgiving!

01:03:33.369 --> 01:03:36.805
You better be back
by Christmas!

01:04:24.177 --> 01:04:27.703
Even down here, you put your name on everything.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.647
Welcome! Oh, welcome!

01:04:30.716 --> 01:04:32.650
Jason Stevens.

01:04:32.718 --> 01:04:36.118
Oh! Oh!
So good to meet you.

01:04:36.187 --> 01:04:38.280
–I'm Bella.
–Hi.

01:04:38.356 --> 01:04:43.173
May I be the first to show you
inside the library your grandfather built?

01:04:45.094 --> 01:04:47.027
–Yeah, sure.
–Oh, good, good.

01:04:51.099 --> 01:04:53.464
Where are all the books?

01:04:53.534 --> 01:04:56.128
Oh.
You joke.

01:04:56.203 --> 01:04:58.137
W- With the people.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:04.269
Is it not like that in the great libraries
de Los Estados Unidos?

01:05:07.646 --> 01:05:10.410
Villagers wait for books.

01:05:10.482 --> 01:05:12.472
You bring them new books.

01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:17.145
They are waiting for you
to pick up old books.

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:21.178
Exchange. Library. Si?

01:05:25.661 --> 01:05:28.925
So basically,
I'm in a third world country…

01:05:28.997 --> 01:05:31.465
at a backwards library
with no books.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.702
And the books that are here,
I can't even read.

01:05:37.037 --> 01:05:39.028
Great.

01:05:42.408 --> 01:05:44.398
Mmm.

01:05:53.217 --> 01:05:57.175
This I found
when I was cleaning his desk…

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:59.949
once I heard
of Red's passing.

01:06:00.023 --> 01:06:02.597
I thought maybe you
would like to keep.

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:07.153
When you sent this to him…

01:06:07.228 --> 01:06:10.994
he proudly showed it
to all of us.

01:06:11.065 --> 01:06:13.056
Then the tragedy.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.691
It broke his heart.

01:06:21.005 --> 01:06:23.166
Dear Grandpa…

01:06:23.241 --> 01:06:25.232
How's Ecuador?

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:27.937
I miss you and Dad so much.

01:06:28.011 --> 01:06:30.707
You know, my birthday's
coming up, and I was thinking…

01:06:30.747 --> 01:06:33.110
instead of giving me gifts
this year…

01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:35.611
could you take me
on one of your trips?

01:06:35.651 --> 01:06:38.620
I promise I won't
cause any trouble.

01:06:38.688 --> 01:06:41.554
I just want to see you
and Dad again soon.

01:06:41.623 --> 01:06:44.750
Write back, please.
Love, Jason.

01:07:01.806 --> 01:07:03.774
Hola.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.910
Un momento, por favor.

01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:24.949
You look
just like your father.

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:29.994
I was here
the night he died.

01:07:36.968 --> 01:07:39.806
It happened up on that mountain,
didn't it?

01:07:42.373 --> 01:07:44.419
–Take me there.
–You cannot go.

01:07:44.441 --> 01:07:46.402
It is now the province
of the drug lords.

01:07:46.442 --> 01:07:48.966
You don't understand.

01:07:49.044 --> 01:07:52.946
I'll pay you.
Well, someday.

01:07:53.015 --> 01:07:56.777
I understand perfectly.
But, senor, I only have one life.

01:07:56.784 --> 01:07:59.548
You're just bargaining now,
aren't you?

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:04.079
Senor Stevens,
you do not want to pay the price it would take.

01:08:04.157 --> 01:08:07.149
No one
who goes there returns.

01:08:11.297 --> 01:08:17.165
Our guest of honor,
Mr Jason Stevens!

01:08:33.615 --> 01:08:36.707
Oh.
Gracias.

01:08:36.783 --> 01:08:38.979
I'm afraid to ask.

01:08:39.053 --> 01:08:41.542
Oh, you will love it.

01:08:41.621 --> 01:08:43.816
It's so rare we catch one.

01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:47.915
–The chief is going to talk.
–Oh.

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:58.859
He says we are here
to celebrate you…

01:08:58.935 --> 01:09:02.596
and those who keep
the Jay Stevens Library alive.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:05.139
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:09.336
No. No. No, no, no.
He must be mistaken.

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:12.372
My grandfather was very generous.
Everything's named after him.

01:09:12.412 --> 01:09:17.279
No, it is the Jay Stevens
Memorial Library.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:31.350
To my father.

01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:33.453
–Salud.
–Salud.

01:09:39.368 --> 01:09:42.564
Have some more.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.363
–Salud.
–Salud.

01:09:47.441 --> 01:09:49.270
Salud!

01:09:49.341 --> 01:09:50.899
Salud.

01:10:41.085 --> 01:10:43.593
You cannot hope
to find it without me.

01:10:44.422 --> 01:10:46.583
How'd you know I'd go?

01:10:46.657 --> 01:10:49.453
You are a Stevens,
are you not?

01:10:49.525 --> 01:10:52.165
I thought you said
you couldn't take me.

01:10:53.729 --> 01:10:57.821
My purpose in coming to you
was a promise I made to Senor Red—

01:10:59.434 --> 01:11:01.428
that you could
learn the truth.

01:11:01.468 --> 01:11:03.630
He had one desire
and one desire alone—

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:05.604
to ask your forgiveness.

01:11:11.644 --> 01:11:14.204
He said one day you would come.

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.307
Only then you could
learn the truth.

01:11:16.347 --> 01:11:19.144
Stop! Stop the jeep.

01:13:10.207 --> 01:13:13.540
He had learned of a village
in the next valley…

01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:16.646
that had a plague and needed
medical supplies.

01:13:17.713 --> 01:13:20.643
But he never understood
why Red forbid him to go.

01:13:20.683 --> 01:13:24.378
There was no plague.
There was no village.

01:13:24.451 --> 01:13:27.147
What?

01:13:27.221 --> 01:13:30.917
Red wanted to introduce
your father to the oil business.

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.754
But your father…

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:36.020
was restless and bored.

01:13:36.094 --> 01:13:38.536
–No. No.
–He snuck away. He ran away…

01:13:38.564 --> 01:13:40.993
–and took a plane he had no business taking.
–No.

01:13:41.033 --> 01:13:45.230
This is what Red wanted
to protect you from. Till now.

01:13:45.303 --> 01:13:47.865
There can be no blame
for what happened here.

01:13:47.905 --> 01:13:50.634
The penalty for
your father's impulsiveness…

01:13:50.674 --> 01:13:52.800
unfortunately, was a life—

01:13:52.875 --> 01:13:55.274
his.

01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:15.921
Americano?

01:14:43.216 --> 01:14:45.480
Ow.

01:15:50.638 --> 01:15:55.835
“It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times…

01:15:55.908 --> 01:15:59.207
”it was the age of wisdom…

01:15:59.278 --> 01:16:02.075
it was the age
of foolishness.”

01:16:05.417 --> 01:16:07.942
Can't you find him?

01:16:08.019 --> 01:16:11.613
We think that
he went searching for the crash site…

01:16:11.689 --> 01:16:14.055
which is in
lawless territory.

01:16:14.124 --> 01:16:17.388
–I'm sorry. Crash site?
–Where his father died.

01:16:19.162 --> 01:16:22.528
Well, I mean, is—
is he in any danger?

01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.234
I'm so sorry.

01:16:33.139 --> 01:16:36.164
“Neither love, nor hate thy life;

01:16:36.241 --> 01:16:39.677
”but what thou livest,
live well…

01:16:39.745 --> 01:16:43.612
however long or short
may the heavens permit.”

01:16:49.086 --> 01:16:51.077
Tell me about my father.

01:16:52.456 --> 01:16:56.447
In many ways, he was
very similar to you—

01:16:56.524 --> 01:17:01.325
restless, rebellious,
angry.

01:17:01.396 --> 01:17:04.262
I think Red
saw something in him…

01:17:04.331 --> 01:17:08.028
that he didn't see
in his other sons—

01:17:08.102 --> 01:17:10.092
a fire.

01:17:11.104 --> 01:17:14.767
The same fire
he sees in you.

01:17:24.048 --> 01:17:26.038
I still don't forgive you.

01:18:05.882 --> 01:18:08.146
Amigo? Amigo,
are you here?

01:18:21.061 --> 01:18:24.324
No, no, no! No! No, no!
Please, no! I can- I can pay you!

01:18:24.364 --> 01:18:26.524
I have money! Please!

01:18:26.598 --> 01:18:30.162
–Oh, God! God! Does anyone
understand what I'm saying?

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.450
“Mueren.” ”Mueren.“

01:19:46.798 --> 01:19:49.197
Muerte.

01:19:49.266 --> 01:19:51.257
Death.

01:20:57.122 --> 01:20:59.351
Hey. Hey.

01:20:59.423 --> 01:21:02.755
Hey. Shh.

01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:05.123
Can you walk?

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.129
Save yourself.

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:10.130
Not on your life.
Come on.

01:21:21.842 --> 01:21:25.811
Come on.

01:21:57.538 --> 01:22:00.199
Hey. Oh. Mmm.

01:22:00.273 --> 01:22:02.264
What are you
doing here?

01:22:03.308 --> 01:22:05.299
I was scared to death.

01:22:07.112 --> 01:22:09.046
Where's Emily?

01:22:09.114 --> 01:22:11.542
Um, she's resting.
She'll see you tomorrow.

01:22:11.582 --> 01:22:13.628
You guys have
a good Christmas?

01:22:13.651 --> 01:22:16.414
We didn't have one.
How could we?

01:22:18.421 --> 01:22:22.585
You know what? We're gonna have
a fantastic one next year.

01:22:22.659 --> 01:22:24.649
I promise.

01:22:29.398 --> 01:22:31.728
We won't have a next year.

01:23:25.143 --> 01:23:30.205
The events of that day
playin my mind over and over and over again.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.042
I'm so sorry.

01:23:32.114 --> 01:23:35.447
If your father hadn't died
while working for me—

01:23:35.518 --> 01:23:37.479
Please give me
a chance to explain.

01:23:37.519 --> 01:23:42.218
Ever since that day, my life
has been filled with grief.

01:23:43.624 --> 01:23:46.660
It is apparent that you
will never forgive me.

01:23:48.295 --> 01:23:50.888
I do not blame you for this.

01:23:50.963 --> 01:23:54.131
It's also something
that I cannot do for myself.

01:23:55.168 --> 01:23:57.965
I loved your father
so much.

01:23:58.036 --> 01:24:03.233
A parent should never have
a child precede them in death.

01:24:03.306 --> 01:24:07.333
It is the most painful
experience imaginable.

01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:09.401
Uh…

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:13.412
that's enough for today,
gentlemen.

01:24:30.463 --> 01:24:32.522
Welcome back, stranger.

01:24:32.598 --> 01:24:35.293
Hey.

01:24:45.875 --> 01:24:47.809
Ta-da.

01:24:47.877 --> 01:24:49.868
Here

01:24:56.684 --> 01:24:58.709
Wow.

01:24:58.786 --> 01:25:00.981
An “airport gift shop” gift.

01:25:01.055 --> 01:25:05.012
How thoughtful.

01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:07.024
Does it come
with needles?

01:25:09.961 --> 01:25:11.952
Uh—

01:25:15.366 --> 01:25:18.562
Yeah, you can kiss me,
even though you're a guy.

01:25:23.173 --> 01:25:25.163
I missed you too.

01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:29.371
Whatever.
Let's cut to the chase.

01:25:30.445 --> 01:25:32.807
You really blew it
with us this Christmas.

01:25:32.847 --> 01:25:35.713
I was unavoidably detained.

01:25:35.783 --> 01:25:37.716
Okay, yeah.

01:25:37.784 --> 01:25:39.775
I want Christmas.

01:25:43.022 --> 01:25:45.512
I want to ride a horse.

01:25:46.858 --> 01:25:50.850
Oh, I got, like, a week or two
left with this other thing…

01:25:50.928 --> 01:25:53.491
but, um, let me make a call
and we'll see—

01:25:53.531 --> 01:25:55.522
Jason.

01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.091
Now.

01:26:00.136 --> 01:26:02.036
Okay.

01:26:02.238 --> 01:26:06.134
–That works for me.
–Excuse me, sir. It's Jason on line two.

01:26:06.174 --> 01:26:08.438
Oh, uh,
will you all excuse me?

01:26:08.509 --> 01:26:11.102
I have to take this call.

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.344
Go ahead, Jason.

01:26:16.416 --> 01:26:18.978
Mr Hamilton, look.
One way or another, this is over.

01:26:19.018 --> 01:26:20.980
Either I was in South America
way too long…

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:23.510
or I missed the deadline
or whatever…

01:26:23.588 --> 01:26:26.284
but what I'm about to do
is way more important.

01:26:26.324 --> 01:26:28.787
And I know you have no reason
whatsoever to trust me…

01:26:28.827 --> 01:26:32.592
but I need to borrow
my grandfather's jet.

01:26:33.597 --> 01:26:36.531
And I need it now.

01:26:36.599 --> 01:26:40.128
I want to take Alexia and Emily to Gus's ranch
for a late Christmas.

01:26:40.168 --> 01:26:43.231
Jason, do you know what you're doing?
Look, I have no control—

01:26:43.271 --> 01:26:47.434
Uh, what, um, Mr Hamilton
was saying was that, uh…

01:26:47.508 --> 01:26:52.308
he'll be sending along
Red's next gift on your Conversay.

01:26:52.378 --> 01:26:54.541
You have your bags
packed within the hour…

01:26:54.581 --> 01:26:57.572
and, uh, he will
have the jet fueled…

01:26:57.649 --> 01:26:59.583
–and ready to go.
–Thank you.

01:26:59.651 --> 01:27:02.586
This means so much to me.
And, Hamilton…

01:27:02.654 --> 01:27:08.065
I promise I'm gonna take back all those
nasty thoughts about you being the Grinch.

01:27:08.124 --> 01:27:10.819
Thanks again. Merry Christmas.

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:19.633
Hey, Gus!

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:24.560
What is this?
Snow in Texas?

01:27:24.638 --> 01:27:28.335
Had it trucked in.
Ho, ho, ho!

01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:32.609
All right, Hector, hit it!

01:27:35.815 --> 01:27:38.338
–Merry Christmas.
–Gus, this is Emily.

01:27:38.415 --> 01:27:41.145
–Hi, Emily. Welcome.
–Alexia.

01:27:41.218 --> 01:27:44.084
–Hi.
–Alexia, how ya doin'?

01:27:44.153 --> 01:27:46.246
–And there he is.
–Hey.

01:27:46.322 --> 01:27:49.086
I'll get your bags.

01:28:04.671 --> 01:28:07.730
I see why you chose this place.

01:28:07.806 --> 01:28:09.852
I wish I could take the credit.

01:28:09.909 --> 01:28:13.605
Emily said her wish was to go
horseback riding with you.

01:28:14.379 --> 01:28:16.313
What?

01:28:16.381 --> 01:28:18.610
Emily—

01:28:18.682 --> 01:28:20.673
What? What's wrong?

01:28:23.353 --> 01:28:25.343
She's—

01:28:26.355 --> 01:28:28.653
She's terrified of horses.

01:28:30.659 --> 01:28:32.650
I'm the one who loves horses.

01:28:36.331 --> 01:28:38.320
Oh, Jason, it's so beautiful.

01:28:38.398 --> 01:28:40.389
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:29:02.986 --> 01:29:05.381
Well, this is what I was tellin' you about.

01:29:05.421 --> 01:29:08.082
–Pretty, huh?
–It's beautiful.

01:29:10.058 --> 01:29:12.719
Hey, come here.
I wanna show you something.

01:29:12.759 --> 01:29:14.750
Gonna be okay, sweetie?

01:29:31.742 --> 01:29:33.676
Alexia…

01:29:33.744 --> 01:29:37.406
–there's something I need to do.
–What?

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:39.413
For Emily.

01:29:45.686 --> 01:29:47.620
And now for me.

01:29:51.324 --> 01:29:53.258
And Gus.

01:29:58.464 --> 01:30:00.398
How about that?

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:22.711
When I achieved my dreams,
it was like going home…

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:25.082
to a place
I'd never been before.

01:30:25.152 --> 01:30:27.528
You don't know that feeling,
do you?

01:30:28.455 --> 01:30:30.850
The first few gifts
I've given you have been practical.

01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:34.883
Show up, do this, do that.

01:30:34.961 --> 01:30:38.953
And then the gifts started
needing you to provide input.

01:30:39.031 --> 01:30:41.157
They needed intuition.

01:30:41.232 --> 01:30:44.428
Still, your average person
is too weighted down.

01:30:44.501 --> 01:30:48.631
Jason, you need to be free,
free to dream.

01:30:48.705 --> 01:30:52.572
You need to come up
with a dream, then act on it.

01:30:52.641 --> 01:30:56.941
Jason, this is the time
for you to dream.

01:31:04.651 --> 01:31:07.449
You thinkin' about butterflies?

01:31:07.521 --> 01:31:10.614
No, Jason, I'm looking at the stars.

01:31:10.689 --> 01:31:14.784
You know,
I set this whole thing up…

01:31:14.859 --> 01:31:17.588
because I thought you wanted
to go horseback riding…

01:31:17.628 --> 01:31:19.619
not your mom.

01:31:19.696 --> 01:31:23.188
Get real. Horses are
smelly and sweaty.

01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:30.062
So, sweetie,
what's your dream?

01:31:30.139 --> 01:31:33.130
If you could dream
of anything —anything—

01:31:34.142 --> 01:31:36.167
what would your dream be?

01:31:37.379 --> 01:31:40.210
My dream?

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:42.646
My dream was
a perfect day.

01:31:44.483 --> 01:31:47.509
And I'm just
finishing it.

01:31:47.586 --> 01:31:52.022
My dream was to be
with people I love…

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:55.287
who love each other,
that love me.

01:32:11.071 --> 01:32:13.539
What about you, Jason?

01:32:14.541 --> 01:32:16.532
What's your dream?

01:32:19.078 --> 01:32:22.377
I don't know.

01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:28.208
For as long as I can remember,
all I wanted to do was have fun.

01:32:30.088 --> 01:32:32.078
Now I don't have a clue.

01:32:33.524 --> 01:32:36.550
It's okay.
Guys are clueless.

01:32:38.628 --> 01:32:41.289
Hey, you have to know this.

01:32:42.598 --> 01:32:44.792
Even if you don't
have a dream of your own…

01:32:44.832 --> 01:32:46.766
you gave me mine.

01:32:46.834 --> 01:32:49.098
–That counts for something.
–Mmm.

01:32:50.771 --> 01:32:52.761
Of course.

01:32:58.611 --> 01:33:01.910
Look at her.
Isn't she beautiful?

01:33:03.983 --> 01:33:06.755
I mean, except for
her choice in lipstick.

01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:12.720
But you have to admit…

01:33:12.788 --> 01:33:16.417
even if you got nothing
else out of the deal but her…

01:33:16.492 --> 01:33:18.891
you'd still be a huge winner.

01:33:24.166 --> 01:33:28.659
Don't blow it. Knowing you,
you're likely to do it.

01:33:34.841 --> 01:33:37.105
Merry Christmas, Jason.

01:33:43.781 --> 01:33:45.771
Merry Christmas.

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:53.954
Up until now,
I have only existed.

01:33:54.957 --> 01:33:56.891
I've, um—

01:33:58.259 --> 01:34:00.288
I've drifted through life
day to day…

01:34:00.328 --> 01:34:03.297
thinking that
that was enough.

01:34:03.364 --> 01:34:06.664
And honestly, I don't know
if I have my own dream.

01:34:08.502 --> 01:34:12.330
But I do know I can help
others fulfill theirs. I know it.

01:34:17.876 --> 01:34:20.780
Jason, will you excuse us
for a few minutes?

01:34:22.079 --> 01:34:24.070
Hamilton & Partners.

01:34:33.488 --> 01:34:39.448
We've deliberated and evaluated
whether or not your answer…

01:34:39.527 --> 01:34:43.929
conforms with the expressed
desires of Red Stevens…

01:34:43.997 --> 01:34:47.955
and we find
that your answer does.

01:34:48.033 --> 01:34:53.436
Therefore, we are releasing
an amount allocated for you at this time.

01:34:54.639 --> 01:34:57.608
That is, uh…

01:34:57.675 --> 01:35:02.839
$100 million to do with
whatever you please.

01:35:05.348 --> 01:35:09.444
All of us here at the firm
want to congratulate you, Jason…

01:35:09.518 --> 01:35:11.452
for sticking it out…

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.612
putting up with some
very harsh conditions…

01:35:14.688 --> 01:35:17.122
and prevailing.

01:35:17.191 --> 01:35:19.181
Congratulations, Jason.

01:35:25.864 --> 01:35:27.798
So that's it?

01:35:27.866 --> 01:35:31.233
Yes, I- I think so.

01:35:31.303 --> 01:35:34.465
No, don't get me wrong.
It's not the amount.

01:35:34.538 --> 01:35:36.529
It's, uh—

01:35:38.608 --> 01:35:40.599
It's just—

01:35:40.677 --> 01:35:42.702
I don't know.
I was…

01:35:42.779 --> 01:35:44.956
expecting a different
feeling or…

01:35:46.981 --> 01:35:48.972
something.

01:35:50.752 --> 01:35:55.051
I think that's
because now you…

01:35:55.122 --> 01:35:57.056
are a diffferent person.

01:35:58.858 --> 01:36:01.520
And, uh—
And, no…

01:36:01.594 --> 01:36:03.772
we won't cash
that check for you.

01:36:07.232 --> 01:36:10.362
Okay, so he is the best
architect in town. That's great.

01:36:10.402 --> 01:36:12.963
Tell him I want a meeting with him
first thing Monday morning.

01:36:13.003 --> 01:36:15.971
–**
–And how much is that?

01:36:16.039 --> 01:36:18.301
I want to tour that property
as soon as possible.

01:36:18.341 --> 01:36:22.604
Oh, that's amazing. We'll have a meeting
at the bank in, let's say, what, a month?

01:36:22.644 --> 01:36:25.106
–That would depend on how
many vehicles you were talking.

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:27.608
–I'm sorry. Can you hold on?
–Certainly.

01:36:27.648 --> 01:36:30.913
–Yeah?
Mr Stevens, a- a young lady to see you.

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:32.918
–Great. Send her up.
–Okay.

01:36:32.986 --> 01:36:35.215
–I'm sorry.
–Will it be a large number of—

01:36:35.255 --> 01:36:37.217
Yeah, there are gonna be
plenty of cars.

01:36:37.257 --> 01:36:40.419
–Okay, we'll have to look into it and let you know.
–Okay, Thank you.

01:36:40.459 --> 01:36:42.450
You're welcome.

01:36:54.403 --> 01:36:58.032
Oh, I like the remodel.

01:37:00.075 --> 01:37:02.566
Where have you been?

01:37:02.644 --> 01:37:04.635
In and out of prison.

01:37:04.713 --> 01:37:07.545
Mmm.
Good to hear.

01:37:08.615 --> 01:37:11.209
No visible tattoos.

01:37:11.285 --> 01:37:13.377
–I missed you.
–Hmm.

01:37:15.321 --> 01:37:17.432
–What's this?
–Oh, it's nothing.

01:37:18.490 --> 01:37:20.423
That's a nice round number.

01:37:20.491 --> 01:37:24.055
Somehow I don't think you'll be having
any more credit card problems, will you?

01:37:24.095 --> 01:37:27.154
You know, um,
you still owe me a dinner.

01:37:27.230 --> 01:37:29.164
How could I ever forget?

01:37:30.233 --> 01:37:32.223
I missed you.

01:37:36.305 --> 01:37:38.334
I think I still
remember my way around.

01:37:38.374 --> 01:37:40.948
Why don't you meet me
in a few minutes?

01:37:49.215 --> 01:37:51.149
How quaint.

01:37:51.217 --> 01:37:53.207
Hmm.

01:37:57.389 --> 01:37:59.549
Jason?
Where'd you go?

01:38:20.907 --> 01:38:24.308
Shall I keep the limo running,
Mr Stevens?

01:38:24.377 --> 01:38:25.968
Maybe not.

01:38:29.348 --> 01:38:32.677
Ah, Mr Hamilton, Miss Hastings,
I'm so happy you came.

01:38:32.717 --> 01:38:36.244
Jason, what's going on?

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.311
Have a seat.
Please. I insist.

01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:48.281
Thank you all for joining me today.
May I direct your attention to—

01:38:51.299 --> 01:38:53.232
It's called Emily's Home.

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:57.064
It's for a dozen or more families
experiencing extraordinary health challenges.

01:38:57.104 --> 01:39:01.733
Now, over here
will be the homes.

01:39:01.808 --> 01:39:04.237
They're part of the same complex,
yet individual dwellings.

01:39:04.277 --> 01:39:08.173
Families are gonna be able to live together
while they face their problems.

01:39:08.213 --> 01:39:10.542
Now, obviously, there's
gonna be plenty of parking.

01:39:10.582 --> 01:39:14.111
Over here is gonna be a state-of-the-art
employment center…

01:39:14.151 --> 01:39:17.081
catering to parents, single or married,
who need to earn some sort of income…

01:39:17.121 --> 01:39:19.214
while their child
undergoes treatment.

01:39:19.254 --> 01:39:23.156
Now, at this
state-of-the-art hospital—

01:39:23.225 --> 01:39:26.853
Excuse me.
What's missing?

01:39:26.928 --> 01:39:29.021
Oh, yeah.
A church…

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:31.826
a worship center.

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:33.832
How much is this
gonna cost?

01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:36.863
If you look at the prospectus
in front of you, page 5.

01:39:36.903 --> 01:39:40.065
The total initial outlay
will be $350 million.

01:39:40.139 --> 01:39:45.037
Your part will be to underwrite the financing
and a loan guarantee of 250 million.

01:39:45.077 --> 01:39:47.739
I'm gonna be putting up the first
100 million of my own money.

01:39:47.779 --> 01:39:52.608
Mr Stevens, this is all well and fine. We did
business with your grandfather for many years.

01:39:52.648 --> 01:39:57.079
Excuse me. I'm sorry for interrupting,
but I didn't phrase this as a question.

01:39:57.119 --> 01:40:01.450
You are gonna do this. You made this much
off my grandfather in a typical year.

01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:05.949
And, gentlemen, this project has…

01:40:06.026 --> 01:40:09.423
the full resources of the Hamilton
law firm backing it. –Yes? Oh, I—

01:40:09.463 --> 01:40:13.899
Pro bono, as I'm sure
you will be too.

01:40:15.168 --> 01:40:17.997
Wrap up the details for me,
will you, Hamilton?

01:40:18.037 --> 01:40:21.072
–My pleasure.
–Thank you all. I appreciate it.

01:40:24.475 --> 01:40:26.806
Hey! Whoa!

01:40:26.877 --> 01:40:29.187
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

01:41:18.253 --> 01:41:20.243
She wanted me to be there.

01:41:22.389 --> 01:41:24.482
It was so important to her.

01:41:27.393 --> 01:41:29.725
She wanted me to be there.

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:41.183
Jason, Alexia,
as mayor of Charlotte…

01:42:41.253 --> 01:42:44.751
it is my extreme honor
and privilege to preside over…

01:42:44.824 --> 01:42:48.350
the ground breaking
for Emily's Home.

01:42:48.426 --> 01:42:52.156
But it is also a sad day…

01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:57.723
in that the namesake and the inspiration
for this incredible project…

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:00.324
is not here with us today.

01:43:01.403 --> 01:43:04.770
But her spirit
will always be with us all.

01:43:09.577 --> 01:43:11.568
Jason, Alexia.

01:43:22.121 --> 01:43:24.054
Thank you very much.

01:43:24.122 --> 01:43:27.716
Thanks.

01:43:35.031 --> 01:43:38.694
I am so proud of the man
you've become.

01:43:38.768 --> 01:43:41.463
Thanks in great part to you.

01:43:41.536 --> 01:43:44.532
Meet me at my office as soon
as possible, will you?

01:43:44.572 --> 01:43:48.136
–I have one more matter I need to discuss.
–Of course.

01:43:51.011 --> 01:43:54.539
We understand you went
outside the boundaries of our instructions…

01:43:54.579 --> 01:43:57.309
with one of those gifts.

01:43:57.382 --> 01:43:59.316
What?

01:43:59.384 --> 01:44:02.618
Don't “what” me.
You know what I'm talking about.

01:44:12.829 --> 01:44:17.449
–Miss Hastings, will you, uh, dismiss everyone, please?
–Oh. Yes, sir.

01:44:35.814 --> 01:44:38.180
Over the course of several days…

01:44:38.249 --> 01:44:40.678
this investigator personally witnessed
and recorded the subject…

01:44:40.718 --> 01:44:45.800
as he committed various misdemeanor
infractions for which he was never cited.

01:44:48.424 --> 01:44:51.985
Nevertheless, illegal
activities did occur.

01:44:53.062 --> 01:44:56.325
Panhandling,
bordering on assault…

01:44:59.433 --> 01:45:03.766
stealing private property,
resale of stolen items…

01:45:07.773 --> 01:45:11.504
street vending
without a permit…

01:45:11.577 --> 01:45:13.510
jaywalking.

01:45:13.578 --> 01:45:18.142
It is the opinion of this investigator
that the subject is a reprobate…

01:45:18.182 --> 01:45:22.012
and not capable of completing
the 12 gifts laid out in Red Stevens's will.

01:45:22.052 --> 01:45:23.847
That's enough, Miss Hastings.

01:45:23.887 --> 01:45:26.081
My pleasure, Mr Hamilton.

01:45:27.088 --> 01:45:31.991
Jason, if you made it this far,
he had one final message.

01:45:49.741 --> 01:45:52.073
–Jason.
–Yeah?

01:45:53.878 --> 01:45:56.649
You gave away the $100 million?
All of it?

01:45:58.615 --> 01:46:01.677
–Yeah, so what?
–Well, if you're standing here now…

01:46:01.717 --> 01:46:06.847
it means that not only have you succeeded
in receiving all of my gifts…

01:46:06.921 --> 01:46:10.551
but have done so beyond
the boundaries that I have set.

01:46:12.193 --> 01:46:15.719
I guess that means
that I have succeeded as well.

01:46:17.931 --> 01:46:20.558
What I could not
accomplish in life…

01:46:20.633 --> 01:46:22.897
I have done in death.

01:46:24.336 --> 01:46:29.101
As long as you are
still alive, I will be too.

01:46:32.376 --> 01:46:34.366
I love you, Son.

01:46:34.443 --> 01:46:36.274
I love you too.

01:46:39.649 --> 01:46:41.707
Good-bye, Jason.

01:47:30.957 --> 01:47:34.084
“As executor of the estate
of Red Stevens…

01:47:34.159 --> 01:47:36.733
”I hereby execute
and otherwise assign…

01:47:36.795 --> 01:47:41.458
”complete and controlling
interest to Jason Stevens…

01:47:41.532 --> 01:47:43.830
”the balance of Red's estate…

01:47:45.169 --> 01:47:48.399
”including all holdings,
investment portfolio…

01:47:48.471 --> 01:47:52.032
”and offshore interests…

01:47:52.108 --> 01:47:57.237
totaling in excess
of two billion dollars.”

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:03.778
Depending on OPEC prices
and foreign currency fluctuations, of course.

01:48:17.262 --> 01:48:19.891
I need a lawyer for a few business ideas I have…

01:48:19.931 --> 01:48:21.892
a few still
in the dream stage.

01:48:21.932 --> 01:48:23.866
When would you like to meet?

01:48:23.934 --> 01:48:26.164
Meet? Hell, you're hired.

01:48:26.236 --> 01:48:29.197
Sir, are you sure you wouldn't like to meet first?

01:48:29.237 --> 01:48:32.729
You were at the top
of your law class, were you not?

01:48:32.807 --> 01:48:35.070
–Yes, sir.
–Then you're my lawyer.

01:48:35.142 --> 01:48:38.574
Now let's get on with it.
We got a world to conquer.

01:48:49.922 --> 01:48:53.380
Do you think I'm old,
Miss Hastings?

01:48:53.458 --> 01:48:55.516
Mm-mmm.

01:48:55.593 --> 01:49:00.722
Well, I think it's about time I retire
from this law firm.

01:49:03.565 --> 01:49:06.864
Whatever will you do,
Mr Hamilton?

01:49:09.103 --> 01:49:11.264
Go to work
with Jason Stevens.

01:49:13.874 --> 01:49:15.899
–Change the world.
–Mmm.

01:49:21.047 --> 01:49:25.049
Hi.

01:49:41.530 --> 01:49:43.521
Thank you.

01:50:18.194 --> 01:50:20.991
So I want
to give you a gift—

01:50:21.062 --> 01:50:26.090
a series of gifts
leading up to, well…

01:50:26.167 --> 01:50:28.964
I wanna call it
“the ultimate gift.”

01:50:29.036 --> 01:50:32.467
Now, you fail in anyway,
it's over. You get nothing.

01:50:38.577 --> 01:50:41.807
You know, you do any work
like you just did…

01:50:41.879 --> 01:50:43.813
you can do anything.

01:50:55.858 --> 01:50:58.622
Now, aren't you
forgettin' something?

01:50:58.694 --> 01:51:01.957
–I don't think so. Shoot.
–The gift.

01:51:02.029 --> 01:51:03.826
The gift of work.

01:51:03.897 --> 01:51:06.457
–Wow.
–Congratulations.

01:51:12.471 --> 01:51:15.803
The charge card company
declined the charge.

01:51:15.874 --> 01:51:19.004
That's impossible. I don't have a credit limit.
Just run it through again.

01:51:19.044 --> 01:51:24.447
It's always our practice to run it through again,
but they declined.

01:51:31.486 --> 01:51:33.181
I need a friend.

01:51:33.255 --> 01:51:36.655
You expect this friendship
to continue?

01:51:36.724 --> 01:51:40.160
I plan on knowing Jason
for the rest of my life.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.457
Do- Do you truly
know how to learn?

01:51:51.537 --> 01:51:54.664
Villagers wait for books.

01:51:54.739 --> 01:51:56.673
You bring them new books.

01:51:56.741 --> 01:52:01.302
They are waiting for you
to pick up old books.

01:52:01.378 --> 01:52:04.778
Exchange. Library.
Si?

01:52:17.124 --> 01:52:20.487
Well, you don't begin to live
until you've lost everything.

01:52:20.527 --> 01:52:23.984
Wait! Wait!

01:52:24.063 --> 01:52:27.691
That's an $8,000 paint job!

01:52:27.766 --> 01:52:29.995
Heck, I've lost everything
three or four times.

01:52:30.035 --> 01:52:32.298
It's the perfect
place to start.

01:52:40.110 --> 01:52:44.478
And Emily— she's—

01:52:46.949 --> 01:52:49.746
–she's the best decision I ever made.
–**

01:52:50.818 --> 01:52:53.878
What's gonna
happen to my mom?

01:52:53.955 --> 01:52:56.199
I really don't hate her,
you know.

01:53:08.398 --> 01:53:10.889
–Salud.
–Salud.

01:53:10.968 --> 01:53:12.833
Salud!

01:53:12.903 --> 01:53:15.336
Salud.

01:53:25.213 --> 01:53:30.172
Jason, you need to be free,
free to dream.

01:53:30.251 --> 01:53:33.279
You need to come up
with a dream, then act on it.

01:53:33.319 --> 01:53:36.619
And honestly, I don't know
if I have my own dream.

01:53:38.524 --> 01:53:41.626
But I do know I can help others
fulfill theirs.

01:53:46.964 --> 01:53:49.693
Uh, I do have to
give away some money.

01:53:49.766 --> 01:53:52.736
You're getting
less mysterious by the minute.

01:53:54.437 --> 01:53:56.597
She owes $1,600
in back rent.

01:53:56.672 --> 01:53:58.765
Pay it.

01:53:58.841 --> 01:54:00.968
You're a hundred
dollars short.

01:54:10.716 --> 01:54:13.276
So, apparently…

01:54:14.353 --> 01:54:17.287
someone came by
and covered my back rent.

01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:20.281
Was it you?

01:54:22.293 --> 01:54:24.090
Thank you.

01:54:32.235 --> 01:54:34.225
What would
your dream be?

01:54:35.636 --> 01:54:38.434
My dream?

01:54:38.506 --> 01:54:40.474
My dream was
a perfect day.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.645
And I'm just
finishing it.

01:54:58.423 --> 01:55:01.585
–I love you, Son.
–I love you too.

01:55:04.728 --> 01:55:06.991
Good-bye, Jason.
