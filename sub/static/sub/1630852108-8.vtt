Mr. Thunder Junior?
Frank Murphy, from Ala-Hican.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.475
Glad to know you, Frank.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.937
I'd shake your hand,
but the bones in my wrist are dust.

00:21.021 --> 00:21.896
Okay.

00:21.980 --> 00:26.067
So, the 747 flies in
from Syracuse first thing tomorrow.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.236
As soon as it's fumigated,
we're going to put it--

00:28.319 --> 00:30.947
Oh, let me guess, between the ramps?

00:31.030 --> 00:33.867
Look, just set that fucking pig down,

00:33.950 --> 00:37.662
and I'll give you a shit show
this fuck town will never forget.

00:37.746 --> 00:38.705
Understood?

00:38.788 --> 00:39.789
Loud and clear.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.959
Well, if that's all,
I better get back home and go see--

00:43.043 --> 00:45.920
Oh, this evening ain't over
by a damn sight.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.590
I don't like to drink alone.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.551
I do it all the time, but I don't like it.

00:51.634 --> 00:54.721
[country music playing]

00:55.930 --> 00:59.976
This is my favorite kind of beer,
in my hand.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.144
[chuckles]

01:05.982 --> 01:09.527
Frank, you're barely binge-drinking.
Something wrong?

01:10.236 --> 01:11.696
Ah, nothing. I'm fine.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.199
Come on. Lean on me, brother.

01:14.866 --> 01:18.870
Well... [clears throat] ...we just passed
the hospital where my father died.

01:19.704 --> 01:22.707
To be honest, I went through
a real rough spot after that.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.626
I was a fucking mess.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.796
Getting you to do this jump
is gonna get me a big bonus.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.924
I think that that's what my dad
was trying to tell me when he died.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.760
That work gives your life value.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.847
You think that could be true?

01:39.224 --> 01:43.019
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I can't hear out of my right ear.

01:43.102 --> 01:45.563
[yelling] I was saying my dad died!

01:45.647 --> 01:47.482
Feeling low, huh?

01:47.565 --> 01:52.195
Well, I only know one way
to take them blues away, partner.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.115
-What are you doing?
-You got to let that shit go, Frank!

01:55.198 --> 01:56.491
All right, the shit has been let go!

01:56.574 --> 01:58.451
Shit has been let go!
No more blues! No more blues!

01:58.535 --> 01:59.494
[Frank screams]

01:59.577 --> 02:01.412
Yeehaw!

02:01.496 --> 02:03.623
Shit!

02:04.582 --> 02:06.084

-Yeah!

02:17.846 --> 02:20.723

'Twas the Jump Before Christmas!

03:34.422 --> 03:36.591
In just one hour, Buster Thunder Junior

03:36.674 --> 03:40.136
will attempt to make
his first successful jump of the 1970s

03:40.220 --> 03:45.225
by soaring over a Boeing 747,
courtesy of Ala-Hican Airlines.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.310
No fucking way Buster makes it!

03:47.393 --> 03:48.519
[both laughing]

03:48.603 --> 03:52.815
Look at me. I'm on the TV box! Whoo!

03:52.899 --> 03:57.445
Dave, these are the kind of simple,
unread people that can swing an election

03:57.528 --> 03:59.614
and make me proud to be an American.

03:59.697 --> 04:03.493
Frank, he's not supposed to be unconscious
until after the jump.

04:03.576 --> 04:07.538
Ed, he told me this was part
of his pre-jump ritual. Just leave him be.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.958
Okay, but he doesn't appear
to be breathing.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.752

This is a better view than the one we had

04:33.106 --> 04:34.357

04:34.440 --> 04:36.276
All right, it's a party!

04:36.359 --> 04:40.738
You're gonna get to see an ambulance

Hey, guys! Gonna get that bonus!

Hey, beautiful.

California, here we come.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.931
I left a note for the boys

They're Greg's problem now.

Welcome back, Ginny Deichpfister.

05:17.525 --> 05:20.570
[groans] This back seat is so lumpy.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.156
That's what you get
when you buy from Tōjō.

05:23.239 --> 05:24.741
Aw, she's coming too?

05:24.824 --> 05:27.744
She's my ma. We live with her.

05:27.827 --> 05:32.707
It's the pedal on the right.
Get driving, Little Miss Mustache.

05:32.790 --> 05:36.252
She's gone. She's really gone.

05:36.336 --> 05:42.884
I will never forget
the six million seconds I spent with her.

05:45.803 --> 05:49.724
Don't you dare roll down that window.
I'm cold!

05:49.807 --> 05:52.977
It was nice seeing you play your music
for those cute little babies.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.771
Yeah, it rocked, huh?

05:54.854 --> 05:58.441
I would've gotten a standing ovation,
but they can't stand up yet.

05:58.524 --> 06:02.236
[chuckles] Kevin. I like
when you pretend to be stupid.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.864
Yeah, you're right. I'm smart as shit.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.949
[jazz music playing on record player]

06:07.033 --> 06:11.204
Hey, guys. You remember Kevin, right?
He pissed off an entire community of Jews.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.539
Yeah. I'm real sorry about all that.

06:13.623 --> 06:14.624
How's your jaw?

06:14.707 --> 06:18.211
I have to drink hamburgers
through a straw now.

06:18.294 --> 06:22.006
No way, they make that?
You must be really good at sucking.

06:22.090 --> 06:26.052
Kevin, it's Christmas Eve. Shouldn't you
be at home terrorizing your family?

06:26.135 --> 06:29.472
They're all down at the airport to watch
the Buster Thunder jump my dad set up.

06:29.555 --> 06:33.976
Ah, yes.
Driving a motorcycle over a jumbo jet.

06:34.519 --> 06:38.147
Sounds like someone
has some unresolved childhood issues.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.609
Yeah, and balls.
It's on channel nine if you want to watch.

06:41.692 --> 06:45.696
Well, I guess I could watch
for research purposes.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.491
You know, I'm working on a book
about male bravado.

06:48.574 --> 06:52.328
It's called The Caveman Who Sighed.

you'll use your best judgment and--

07:03.297 --> 07:05.466

07:07.093 --> 07:09.178
Up front with a great view
of the landing ramp,

07:09.262 --> 07:10.346
just behind the bloodmobile.

07:10.429 --> 07:12.640
Yes, splendid. Good job, Murphy.

07:12.723 --> 07:17.061
Thanks. And can I say that I am
so grateful that you liked my idea--

07:17.145 --> 07:19.939
Murphy, where can I get
a scotch and soda around here?

07:20.022 --> 07:23.025
Well, all we have is a beer tent.
I can get you one.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.279
Excellent! And let's get some
for the whole board!

07:26.362 --> 07:28.197
-Yes, I'll have one.
-A beer sounds perfect.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.908
Are you gonna give me the money now
or when I, uh...

07:32.076 --> 07:34.745
It's on me. Shit.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.957
Mr. Mayor. Nice to meet you

07:38.040 --> 07:39.709
for the first time.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.794
It is nice to meet you as well,

07:41.878 --> 07:43.796
having never seen you before.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.425
And depending on how this goes,
maybe not even now.

07:47.508 --> 07:51.596
Thanks for making sure my union boys
got the construction job on this.

07:51.679 --> 07:54.932
We saved a mint
by not using nuts on the speaker towers.

07:55.016 --> 07:59.020
Bolts yes, nuts no.
If you know what I mean.

I do know what you mean,
if you know what I mean.

08:02.190 --> 08:05.109
There they are, fucking crooks.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.279
They won't know what hit them
when we skin them alive.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.574
Skin. I used to love that word.

08:11.657 --> 08:15.203
You get me in that TV truck,
and I'll slip in my hidden camera tape

08:15.286 --> 08:17.872

bribing the mayor. [chuckles]

08:17.955 --> 08:19.749
I was all set to air it last year,

08:19.832 --> 08:23.503
but the mayor got wind of it
and destroyed my reputation

08:23.586 --> 08:27.673
by concocting
that whole pregnancy fetish about me.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.675
So you ain't freaky for late bitches?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.135
Pure fiction.

-Keep them coming.
-Jesus, did your wife leave you?

It's called business!

I'm so glad you're back with us.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.236
Me too, buddy.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.113
Do you barge into people's houses
and announce yourself,

08:51.197 --> 08:52.323
like Bruce Again does?

08:52.406 --> 08:56.118
[chuckles] Oh, honey, if you want to see
real gay people on television,

Wow, Vic. This ad is great.
It'll really help my business get going.

now we break into the truck.

If anyone tries to stop us,
I'll simply explain I'm the van inspector.

That's Mr. Mr. Mayor to you.

of safely operating a motorized vehicle

Well, I can't jump that!

Aw, shit!

11:27.019 --> 11:28.270
Uh, not much.

11:28.354 --> 11:32.066
Just spending most of my time
writing songs for babies.

And just when it looks like we're gonna...
we're gonna figure it all out,

23:24.486 --> 23:27.823
he dies and drops some shit
about box 16 in my lap.

23:27.906 --> 23:31.493
[chuckles] Good ol' Bach 16.

23:32.369 --> 23:35.288
-You know what it is?
-Oh yeah, sure.

23:35.372 --> 23:39.543
I've spent the last two months trying
to figure out what the fuck that means.

23:39.626 --> 23:41.253
I must've looked through every box
in the city.

23:41.336 --> 23:44.506
Box? No. It's Bach!

23:44.589 --> 23:46.883
Johann Sebastian Bach.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.885
The music guy with the faggy wig.

23:48.969 --> 23:52.305
Bach's "Prelude and Fugue Number 16."

23:52.389 --> 23:54.975
It was your dad's favorite piece of music.

23:55.058 --> 23:58.812
[scatting tune]

23:58.895 --> 24:01.148
He was telling me about music?

24:01.231 --> 24:04.526
Why that? Wa... was it...
was it important to his life?

24:04.609 --> 24:06.653
It was the jingle for White House Beer.

24:06.736 --> 24:09.656
Used to be on the radio all the time
in the '30s.

24:09.739 --> 24:12.242
♪ Have a beer, drink a beer ♪

24:12.325 --> 24:14.244
♪ Want a beer? White House Beer ♪

24:15.120 --> 24:17.914
He'd sing it when he'd come in here
and get plastered.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.708
Lot of times on Christmas.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.002
Just like you. How about that? [chuckles]

24:22.544 --> 24:25.005
He always said
he wanted it played at his funeral.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.965
Be good for a chuckle, he'd say.

24:28.508 --> 24:33.680
Ah, jeez, I'm sorry if you thought
that it meant something more than that.

24:34.764 --> 24:35.807
Perfect.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.643
Perfect.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.396
Of all the things he could've said to me
when he was dying,

24:41.479 --> 24:43.857
he puts in a song request.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.609
That selfish son of a bitch.

24:45.692 --> 24:49.487
He wasn't all bad.
He just didn't know how to be a dad.

24:49.571 --> 24:53.158
How fucking hard is it
to not be an asshole to your own kid?

24:53.241 --> 24:57.120
Well, you're here drinking on Christmas,
so you tell me.

25:03.793 --> 25:06.796
["Prelude and Fugue Number 16" playing]

25:32.405 --> 25:35.242
Eh, Merry Christmas, Dad. We're done.

25:38.828 --> 25:41.623
Ah shit, here comes Scrooge McDick.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.251
Act sad so he doesn't take
our Christmas presents.

25:49.839 --> 25:52.133
Hey, Billy. How you doing, Phillip?

25:54.928 --> 25:59.140
He didn't tell me to go fuck myself.
Maybe he's sick.

25:59.224 --> 26:03.395
I would say he's drunk,
but usually that just makes him meaner.

26:04.646 --> 26:08.483
So, did it dawn on you
that it's Christmas?

26:09.776 --> 26:13.571
-I found out what box 16 means.
-Really?

26:13.655 --> 26:15.532
It means my parents
were two messed-up people

26:15.615 --> 26:17.242
who fucked and made me.

26:17.742 --> 26:20.704
And nothing more.
That's something to build on.

26:20.787 --> 26:21.788
Yep.

26:22.747 --> 26:25.709
Ah, Sue, I'm so sorry.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.795
You were right. You're always right.

26:28.878 --> 26:31.840
From now on, I'm just gonna listen to you

26:31.923 --> 26:35.552
instead of daredevils, angry candy men,

26:36.428 --> 26:39.097
psycho Air Force pilots, hookers at wakes.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.015
That's a start.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.684
Right now, I'd just love
to have a nice Christmas

26:42.767 --> 26:45.020
with my family, if that's okay.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.980
I made pigs in blankets

26:47.063 --> 26:49.941
with your favorite vegetable, mustard.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.109
God, I love you.

26:54.696 --> 26:55.989
[babbling]

26:58.074 --> 27:00.910
Everyone, something I want to tell you.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.581
The last year or so
has been very hard for me,

27:04.664 --> 27:06.416
and that means it's been harder for you.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.919
Well, I learned something
about myself today.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.298
-I learned that if you're--
-[phone ringing]

27:22.307 --> 27:23.683
Here we go.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.157
[dial tone humming]

27:42.369 --> 27:45.038
-Let's eat.
-What if they're calling from work?

27:45.121 --> 27:46.581
It might be important.

27:46.664 --> 27:48.708
Nah, this is important.

27:50.293 --> 27:52.629
Is he having a stroke, or am I?

27:53.713 --> 27:54.881
[chuckles]

27:54.964 --> 27:55.965
Watch it!

27:56.049 --> 27:56.883
[all laugh]

27:56.966 --> 27:59.677
I tell you, Sue. He's a little comedian!

27:59.761 --> 28:00.929
Hey, I'm funny too!

28:01.012 --> 28:03.139
Yeah, but looks and smells don't count.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.265
[all laugh]

28:04.349 --> 28:05.725
You're so dead!

28:06.267 --> 28:09.979
[Frank] Don't slack on your studies, Bill.
Can't earn a living making people laugh.
