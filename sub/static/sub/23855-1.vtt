to see you in uniform.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.993
It's been a while. He's so proud.

28:24.077 --> 28:28.998

about Afghanistan and Kandastan.

to function independently.

That's when they found him,
earlier tonight.

Two people found him. Their dog, actually.

with the details? I...

Wanna step back, whoever you are,
and let me talk to the family?

34:52.507 --> 34:55.093

coming up in here

-[Isaiah] Seth, let me handle this.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.556

Brenton's 16th birthday's coming up soon.

35:03.851 --> 35:06.813
Now, what's gonna happen
to the man who did this?

35:06.896 --> 35:08.689
Well, I'll be charging Mr. Dorsey

35:08.815 --> 35:11.150
with leaving the scene
of a motor vehicle accident

35:11.234 --> 35:13.069
resulting in serious bodily injury.

35:13.444 --> 35:16.072
And I'll suggest the maximum sentence
for this type of felony.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.074
Which is what, exactly?

35:18.449 --> 35:19.617
Three to five years.

35:23.913 --> 35:27.792
My son laid in the cold...

in the snow, in pain...

35:32.088 --> 35:33.214
for hours.

35:34.298 --> 35:37.802
And no one came for him except a dog.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.890
He may never walk again.

35:44.016 --> 35:46.394
He may never wake up again.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.939
And you're telling me
that the person that did this

35:50.273 --> 35:52.441
will get three to five years?

35:52.817 --> 35:55.903
That man deserves to die
for what he did to my son!

35:56.028 --> 35:56.946

over our son Brenton.

I'm sorry. I was in the wrong room.

38:52.079 --> 38:53.414
I'm gonna turn myself in.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.376
But nobody's gotta know
none of you were there.

39:04.383 --> 39:05.509
Just to be clear...

39:08.054 --> 39:09.472
this is what's gonna happen.

39:12.975 --> 39:14.602
Well, they are gonna fuck you...

39:16.187 --> 39:17.355
for Ferguson...

39:18.272 --> 39:20.107
Chicago, Baltimore...

39:21.901 --> 39:24.904
for every white cop
who ever killed a black kid.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.699
-It was an accident.
-No one gives a shit.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.536
So, before you do anything,

39:32.620 --> 39:35.915
I want you to think about what kind
of father you'd be behind bars...

39:37.041 --> 39:38.376
out of your son's life.

39:39.752 --> 39:41.212
He ain't ever gonna know you.

39:44.590 --> 39:48.052
You're a good cop, I see it.
That's why I picked you.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.891
You and me? We're a dying breed.

39:55.935 --> 39:59.397
And we take care of our own,
you understand?

40:16.622 --> 40:18.707
[DiAngelo] Don't go behind my back again.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.565
-[sighs]
-[man speaks indistinctly]

40:43.566 --> 40:45.359
[Fish] I need the paperwork
on my hit-and-run.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.610
It's Mac Dorsey's car.

40:47.361 --> 40:49.697
Who's the owner of the car?
We need a signature.

40:50.239 --> 40:53.075
[Fish] I told you, Mac Dorsey.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.373
[Fish] Hey!

40:59.957 --> 41:01.709
They need your John Hancock!

41:12.970 --> 41:13.971
You want to wait inside?

41:14.054 --> 41:16.974
It'll take about half an hour
to release the paperwork on the vehicle.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.186
[KJ] I'll wait in the car.

41:20.519 --> 41:23.105
Why? It's just a sign off.

41:23.189 --> 41:24.899
[man] My supervisor's on break.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.318
It's two in the fucking morning,
what's he doing?

41:27.401 --> 41:29.361
[man] It's out of my hands.
You can wait inside--

41:29.445 --> 41:31.655
-[cell phone buzzes]
-Rather freeze my balls off. Thanks.

41:32.114 --> 41:33.032
[Fish] Hey.

41:33.949 --> 41:36.619
Well, you gotta use the tape
on the diaper, I told you that.

41:36.744 --> 41:38.913
Or he's gonna be dropping shit bombs
all over the place.

41:39.747 --> 41:40.873
Well, use your head.

41:41.790 --> 41:44.293
How's Lizzie doing?
Give her the hamburger yet?

41:51.550 --> 41:52.968
[Fish] That's good.

41:53.385 --> 41:54.428
And the twins?

41:55.471 --> 41:58.265
What do you mean what about them?
They've been depressed all week.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.393
[Fish continues indistinctly]

42:01.644 --> 42:03.854
All right, well, about another half hour.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.439
I'll call you from the road.

42:17.284 --> 42:18.369
[Fish] You gonna hit that?

42:18.911 --> 42:20.371
Because there's a cream.

42:20.454 --> 42:21.372
[KJ] What?

42:21.455 --> 42:24.500
I'm telling you, hobo herpes,
it's a thing. I swear to God.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.377
Did you see Dorsey's face?

42:41.767 --> 42:44.228
That pastor of yours
found a chapel downstairs.

42:44.645 --> 42:46.855
Wants you to head down
for some holy rolling with Jesus.

42:46.939 --> 42:48.899
Seth. Enough.

42:51.652 --> 42:55.656
[monitor beeping steadily]

43:07.459 --> 43:09.670
Why'd you tell the police
we bought Brenton that bike?

43:12.006 --> 43:13.632
You saw his face.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.760
He already had his mind made up
that he was in a gang.

43:17.511 --> 43:19.263
Because of what? The bike?

43:21.140 --> 43:22.266
Where'd he get it from?

43:23.851 --> 43:25.394
What was he doing in that park?

43:29.648 --> 43:32.109
I won't tolerate
you covering up for him anymore.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.614
I know he'd been going back
to the projects, and that park,

43:36.947 --> 43:38.907
after I explicitly told him not to go.

43:40.075 --> 43:42.328
'Saiah, he misses his friends.

43:43.037 --> 43:44.204
He misses his home.

43:44.288 --> 43:45.539
That's not his home.

43:48.417 --> 43:49.501
Not anymore.

43:56.884 --> 43:58.469
I don't know where he got it.

44:14.109 --> 44:15.486
[Seth] You ought to go with him.

44:16.028 --> 44:19.490
Go on, Tricey. I'll stay here with B.

44:19.948 --> 44:23.160
He's gonna suffocate Brenton
with all of his worries.

44:27.247 --> 44:28.332
Just like he did you.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.678
Kid must've been conscious for a while.

44:43.013 --> 44:45.599
He's stuck
between these two snowbanks here.

44:46.725 --> 44:47.976
Crawling around,

44:48.310 --> 44:50.896
trying to find a way out,
probably screaming for his mama.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.695
Crime scene photos
give you the heebie-jeebies?

44:59.613 --> 45:01.073
I don't need to look at them.

45:05.327 --> 45:07.329
Isn't that, like, your job?
[clears throat]

45:07.496 --> 45:11.959
Nope. My job is to file paperwork.

45:12.710 --> 45:17.172
File paperwork? You could file paperwork
at any fuck-face firm down on the water.

45:17.631 --> 45:18.966
I'm sick of their eyes.

45:20.926 --> 45:21.844
What?

45:24.638 --> 45:26.265
Even when they're dead, it's...

45:30.519 --> 45:32.730
They're looking at you, wanting answers.

45:33.814 --> 45:35.190
You worked Homicide before?

45:40.571 --> 45:42.197
How'd you get bumped to car crimes?

45:43.407 --> 45:45.868
Car crimes. Heh... right.

45:48.370 --> 45:50.330
Paralyzing a kid
gets you three to five years,

45:50.414 --> 45:52.791
but it's guaranteed
you won't do most of that time.

45:54.710 --> 45:56.545
It's the greatest show on Earth,
this shit.

45:59.882 --> 46:02.217
Did you see the driver's seat
in Dorsey's car?

46:03.218 --> 46:04.136
Mm-hm.

46:04.970 --> 46:08.182
That narc cop said
he had to chase him down,

46:08.265 --> 46:10.851
driving around outside the park, right?
That's how they caught him.

46:11.685 --> 46:12.811
So?

46:13.520 --> 46:15.105
So, how do you drive lying down?

46:23.655 --> 46:25.240
Here comes asshat. Finally.

46:30.454 --> 46:32.790
-[man] Have a good night.
-Whatever. Go fuck yourself.

46:37.294 --> 46:38.462
Ah, okay.

46:40.464 --> 46:43.675
I'm gonna write up the kid's belongings
in the morning. [sniffs]

46:43.967 --> 46:46.386
-Okay.
-You know, I can get an Uber from here.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.388
But, yo, it was good working with you.

46:48.472 --> 46:49.932
Yeah. You too.

46:54.728 --> 46:55.771
And um...

46:58.148 --> 47:01.109
Listen, the dead don't need answers.

47:03.028 --> 47:05.447
They're dead. Okay?

47:07.825 --> 47:10.828
See you at trial in the morning.
Don't forget about those mints, huh?

47:11.537 --> 47:12.704
[KJ sighs]

47:14.790 --> 47:15.624
[taps window]

47:17.751 --> 47:18.752
Asshole.

47:37.688 --> 47:38.897
Oh...

47:39.439 --> 47:40.357
Fuck!

47:55.998 --> 47:56.999
[exhales]

48:04.256 --> 48:06.842
[monitor beeping steadily]

49:21.166 --> 49:22.209
[nurse] Excuse me.

49:22.793 --> 49:23.835
Are you family?

49:29.883 --> 49:31.093
I'm his attorney.

50:07.838 --> 50:11.383
[clerk] Complaint number 39012,
the State versus Mac Henry Dorsey.

50:13.093 --> 50:15.137
The counselor's appearance
for the record.

50:18.807 --> 50:20.225
[judge] Is the State gonna talk?

50:20.434 --> 50:22.644
Judge, it's not my complaint number.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.563
Then where the hell is my prosecutor?

50:25.022 --> 50:26.857
[attorney] I'm sorry, Judge. I don't know.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.359
Next case.

50:30.527 --> 50:35.115
[clerk] Complaint number 39013,
the State versus Lonny Mendoza.

50:37.325 --> 50:38.994
[geese honking]

51:39.763 --> 51:41.848
[gasps softly]
