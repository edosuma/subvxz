00:01.030 --> 00:02.630
Hi, you've reached Joe Dubois.

00:02.760 --> 00:04.520
Please leave your name and
number and I'll call you back.

00:04.530 --> 00:05.520
Hey, honey, it's me.

00:05.520 --> 00:07.939
Look, I stopped at one
of those super stores

00:07.939 --> 00:10.130
To pick up some cleaning supplies,

00:10.130 --> 00:11.770
And time kind of got away from me.

00:13.150 --> 00:16.020
I was hoping I could
sell you on some chinese

00:16.030 --> 00:18.060
Or some mexican tonight.

00:18.730 --> 00:21.620
Little executive decision here.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.880
I can't even remember
where I parked now.

00:25.850 --> 00:26.730
All right, well, I'll see you soon.

00:26.730 --> 00:29.770
I'll be the girl with the
bag or the box of food.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.560 --> 00:53.440
Hey, lady, excuse me.

00:54.150 --> 00:55.700
Can you spare some
change for the bus?

00:55.950 --> 00:58.540
I got to get home so I can
do homework, but I'm broke.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.040
Maybe you could lend me five bucks?

01:00.110 --> 01:00.790
Lend you?

01:00.950 --> 01:01.570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.070
You just-- you give me
your name and address,

01:03.070 --> 01:04.830
And I'll mail it
back to you. I swear.

01:06.120 --> 01:06.930
I just don't get it.

01:06.980 --> 01:08.160
Why do you need to take the bus?

01:09.140 --> 01:10.680
Why don't your friends
give you a ride?

01:17.310 --> 01:17.960
You're right.

01:18.990 --> 01:20.220
For that matter,
why don't I just take your purse

01:20.230 --> 01:21.780
And help myself to whatever I want.

01:22.810 --> 01:23.480
Take it.

01:24.110 --> 01:24.910
Wait, wait, wait,

01:25.080 --> 01:25.840
Wait, please.

01:26.150 --> 01:30.020
Listen, my little girls'
baby pictures are in there.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.370
Can I just take them out
of my wallet, please?

01:32.430 --> 01:33.550
I don't have any copies.

01:34.610 --> 01:35.520
Yeah, sure.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.810
And if there are any fives,
tens or 20s

01:37.810 --> 01:39.150
You feel particularly attached to,

01:39.440 --> 01:40.570
Maybe you should keep those, too.

01:42.310 --> 01:42.890
Hey!

01:43.430 --> 01:44.450
Those pictures--

01:44.730 --> 01:46.100
I'm not going to ask you again.

02:30.510 --> 02:32.430
You stupid, gutless

02:32.780 --> 02:33.630
Punks.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.030
I would have given you my purse,

02:37.220 --> 02:41.810
But nobody touches my
little girls' baby pictures.

02:46.170 --> 02:47.650
Ew, what's that smell?

02:51.600 --> 02:55.170
That's it. That's it.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.500
Take a good deep breath of that.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.390
just keep those
eyes open for a bit,

02:59.430 --> 03:01.030
And I'll put away
the smelling salts.

03:02.760 --> 03:03.670
What happened?

03:04.140 --> 03:05.520
What's going on?
What happened to me?

03:06.280 --> 03:07.280
You were mugged, ma'am.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.960
You've been out cold for
the last ten minutes.

03:47.070 --> 03:52.250
medium  615

04:05.800 --> 04:06.660
You okay?

04:07.990 --> 04:08.610
Me?

04:09.700 --> 04:10.610
I'm fine.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.740
I want to kill somebody,
but other than that...

04:15.250 --> 04:16.370
I'm not getting any service.

04:16.610 --> 04:17.910
I think I ought to duck outside.

04:17.970 --> 04:20.260
I want the girls to know that
we'll be coming home soon.

04:20.459 --> 04:21.339
Yeah, yeah, go.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.040
I'm fine.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.140
That's some shiner.

04:34.270 --> 04:35.450
You mind if I ask how it happened?

04:37.660 --> 04:38.600
I got mugged.

04:40.660 --> 04:41.630
Waiting for an x-ray?

04:42.720 --> 04:43.640
Cat scan.

04:44.710 --> 04:45.400
You?

04:46.540 --> 04:47.960
I broke my knuckle.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.640
Same as the last two
times I was here.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.400
Wow, you broke that three times?

04:53.820 --> 04:54.840
Well, it's

04:54.930 --> 04:56.010
Occupational hazard.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.070
I'm an instructor for a
program called prevail.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.480
It's a self-defense course.

05:01.990 --> 05:05.190
We teach people how to handle
themselves in sticky situations.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.240
I wish I had met you last week.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.370
Ms. Hudack? Yeah.

05:20.260 --> 05:21.470
Here's hoping nothing like this

05:21.470 --> 05:22.540
Ever happens to you again.

05:29.490 --> 05:31.680
Oh, my god, mom,
what did they do to your face?

05:31.870 --> 05:34.130
What, this? Honey, this is nothing.

05:34.210 --> 05:35.670
You should see the other guy.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.930
Shh, don't cry.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.900
Ó²

05:48.910 --> 05:49.740
Okay.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.150
I just called all the
credit card companies,

05:52.210 --> 05:53.170
And I canceled everything.

05:53.310 --> 05:55.560
Oh, great, they
didn't get your keys.

05:56.210 --> 05:56.800
Here.

05:58.220 --> 05:59.630
Okay, so I'll take
ariel with me tomorrow,

05:59.680 --> 06:00.650
And I'll go pick up your car.

06:01.370 --> 06:02.070
That's great.

06:02.330 --> 06:05.010
Except I still can't remember
where I actually parked.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.190
Well, that's all right.

06:06.740 --> 06:09.040
I also called devalos while
you were in your cat scan.

06:09.110 --> 06:10.560
I told him that you needed rest.

06:10.610 --> 06:11.790
You weren't coming
into work tomorrow.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.700
Wait a second... No, allison.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.000
The doctor said you needed rest.

06:15.050 --> 06:16.130
I say you need rest.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.310
Phoenix can do without
its psychic for one day.

06:28.950 --> 06:29.900
Did you hear that?

06:38.860 --> 06:39.640
Joe?

06:41.740 --> 06:42.870
Joe, did you hear that?

06:56.450 --> 06:58.030
joe, what are you doing?

07:01.880 --> 07:04.000
I haven't been able to get you
out of my mind, sweet thing.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.100
I got your address on
your driver's license.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.260
Thought I'd come by and get
to know you a little better.

07:19.490 --> 07:20.910
It's not a martial arts class.

07:21.710 --> 07:23.920
I mean, we teach average people
how to do things anybody can do.

07:25.370 --> 07:26.820
We train you how to
avoid confrontation,

07:26.860 --> 07:29.830
But also, you know, what to do
if you find yourself in one.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.860
Every day at work,
I see the most horrible things.

07:35.710 --> 07:40.220
I see torture, mutilation, death.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.160
You'd think nothing
would get to me.

07:46.440 --> 07:50.510
Ever since this kid hit me,
something has changed.

07:51.260 --> 07:53.610
I just don't feel like the
ground that I'm walking on

07:53.620 --> 07:55.430
Is as solid as it used to be.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.090
You know, it's going to
continue to feel like that

08:00.550 --> 08:01.620
Until you can convince yourself

08:01.620 --> 08:03.300
That the world is a
manageable place again.

08:04.740 --> 08:05.710
I know what it's like.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.240
And if it hadn't been for prevail,

08:08.240 --> 08:10.040
I'm sure I'd still be dwelling
on what happened to me.

08:12.010 --> 08:12.860
Six years ago,

08:13.060 --> 08:14.230
I was coming home from the gym,

08:15.160 --> 08:16.520
And there was a man
in my apartment.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.100
The police said he got
in through a window.

08:20.850 --> 08:23.290
He was just... Sitting there,

08:24.430 --> 08:25.340
Waiting for me.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.310
He grabbed me while I was
looking through a stack of mail.

08:29.800 --> 08:33.630
He... Beat me until
I could barely move.

08:34.700 --> 08:35.780
He broke all my ribs.

08:35.990 --> 08:38.110
He broke one of my arms,
my cheekbone.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.390
And then he raped me.

08:42.610 --> 08:43.799
Three times.

08:44.990 --> 08:46.310
When he was done, he just left.

08:46.420 --> 08:47.870
I don't know, I think
he thought I was dead.

08:50.590 --> 08:52.050
It all happened so fast,
it was like...

08:53.380 --> 08:55.100
He was on me, he was hitting me,

08:55.750 --> 08:57.040
And then my eyes were swollen shut

08:57.040 --> 08:58.820
Before I even saw
what he looked like.

09:00.330 --> 09:01.120
Anyway, I...

09:03.920 --> 09:06.640
I walked around with this
feeling you're describing...

09:09.080 --> 09:11.330
For a really long time.

09:13.090 --> 09:14.310
And then I found this place.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.020
I want you to feel the ground
underneath your feet again,

09:18.070 --> 09:18.940
And I think we can help.

09:23.960 --> 09:24.670
You wanted to see me?

09:25.870 --> 09:26.680
Yeah, lee, come on in.

09:33.870 --> 09:34.560
Take a look.

09:35.160 --> 09:35.820
What's this?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.870
These are still
frames from a video.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.010
The man wearing the mask

09:41.020 --> 09:43.150
Is raping the girl.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.490
She's 15. Her name is kate hatton.

09:45.790 --> 09:47.350
She used a fake I.D.
To get into a bar.

09:47.450 --> 09:48.610
Somebody spiked her drink.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.410
She woke up the next
day in the alley

09:50.910 --> 09:52.700
And realized that she'd
been sexually assaulted,

09:52.770 --> 09:54.530
But she couldn't
describe her assailant.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.530
And there was no dna
evidence recovered.

09:57.720 --> 09:58.800
Then we found this video

09:58.860 --> 09:59.770
Right there on the internet.

10:00.230 --> 10:00.870
Wait a second.

10:00.940 --> 10:04.120
This guy raped a teenage girl,
videoed it and then posted it?

10:05.290 --> 10:05.840
Yeah.

10:06.330 --> 10:07.890
We blew some of these images up--

10:08.320 --> 10:12.090
Looking for anything that might
help us identify this guy.

10:12.540 --> 10:14.850
Compared that to what was in
the sex offenders registry.

10:15.270 --> 10:16.330
We thought we had a match,

10:16.440 --> 10:18.280
And then we realized
that video alone

10:18.360 --> 10:19.730
Would be inconclusive in court.

10:20.070 --> 10:22.190
So, I got a detective

10:22.260 --> 10:23.850
From vice, had him go undercover.

10:24.570 --> 10:25.670
Made up a phony name.

10:25.850 --> 10:27.540
Put him in the sex
offenders registry,

10:28.320 --> 10:31.210
Posing as a child
molester on parole.

10:31.390 --> 10:33.500
Henry maynard-- he called himself.

10:33.940 --> 10:35.040
We got him into the same

10:35.100 --> 10:37.460
Court-ordered therapy
group as the suspect,

10:37.530 --> 10:38.850
Hoping that he would
get close enough,

10:38.910 --> 10:40.270
And the suspect would
confide in him.

10:40.790 --> 10:43.580
Give him some details of the crime.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.600
Something we could
use in court, or...

10:48.760 --> 10:49.590
And?

10:50.100 --> 10:53.220
And our made-up henry
maynard hasn't checked in

10:53.270 --> 10:54.180
In over a week.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.360
You're thinking our
masked man figured out

10:56.400 --> 10:58.050
There's an undercover
cop on his tail?

10:58.660 --> 10:59.480
All we know is

10:59.550 --> 11:00.900
Is that he approached the suspect,

11:00.960 --> 11:02.710
The investigation was proceeding,

11:02.770 --> 11:04.310
And then he just vanished.

11:07.530 --> 11:08.640
Tell me what I can do to help.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.820
Well, that's just it.

11:14.850 --> 11:15.810
I don't want your help.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.870
I called you in here
'cause you're a friend.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.480
I called you in here
to give you a heads-up.

11:21.050 --> 11:21.900
This is a case

11:21.970 --> 11:23.890
You cannot be involved in, lee.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.920
This is a case you've
got to stay away from.

11:29.880 --> 11:30.620
I'm sorry.

11:32.060 --> 11:33.160
Take a look at the pictures again.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.700
The suspect has been
convicted twice before

11:40.770 --> 11:43.820
Of rape, one time against a minor.

11:45.410 --> 11:47.210
Been out of prison
nearly three years now.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.820
I'm almost certain
that's your brother.

11:58.750 --> 12:01.090
I'm confused. I thought your
brother was living in oregon.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.140
Well, he's not;
he's back in phoenix.

12:03.210 --> 12:04.530
And I guess he's been here awhile.

12:05.810 --> 12:06.850
Nice for him to tell me, right?

12:10.530 --> 12:12.350
As far as whether not
that's him in that video,

12:12.400 --> 12:14.050
I can't even wrap
my brain around it.

12:15.140 --> 12:17.690
Now they're talking like maybe
he killed this detective,

12:19.100 --> 12:22.140
This... Henry maynard guy,
or whatever his real name is.

12:25.530 --> 12:26.430
I think I'll go talk to him.

12:28.570 --> 12:29.220
; lee...

12:31.330 --> 12:32.290
Leigh.

12:46.770 --> 12:47.590
It's weird.

12:49.740 --> 12:51.770
When I think about him,
all I remember is

12:51.830 --> 12:53.510
A older brother that
kept my drunken father

12:53.550 --> 12:55.100
From beating the crap out of me.

12:56.690 --> 12:58.240
Growing up, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

13:03.540 --> 13:04.820
I don't even know him anymore.

13:16.810 --> 13:17.480
Hey, bo.

13:27.770 --> 13:28.580
Mr. Good.

13:38.590 --> 13:39.480
So I heard a rumor--

13:40.770 --> 13:41.640
I'm a uncle now.

13:43.220 --> 13:44.540
Had a little girl last August.

13:45.650 --> 13:46.510
Name's leigh.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.490
Uh-huh.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.540
Me and the mom are engaged.

13:50.780 --> 13:52.880
Well, that's good, mr. Good.

13:53.790 --> 13:55.000
That's terrific, man.

13:56.930 --> 13:58.220
You got any pictures or...?

14:03.300 --> 14:06.290
Well, maybe I can
meet her sometime.

14:12.630 --> 14:16.930
Look, lee... Here's the thing, man.

14:19.740 --> 14:21.020
I'm not like I used to be.

14:23.740 --> 14:26.110
Prison... It beats
the bad out of you.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.270
And any little bit of bad
that they didn't get,

14:30.310 --> 14:31.590
The parole system takes care of.

14:32.730 --> 14:34.860
They got me in group,
five days a week now.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.070
That's good, paul.

14:39.130 --> 14:40.370
The stuff with the girls--

14:42.300 --> 14:43.900
I'm on all the databases now,

14:43.960 --> 14:45.900
And I got the brand on me:
"Sex offender,"

14:46.090 --> 14:49.030
But I'm not... Some pervert.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.350
It was about anger.

14:53.230 --> 14:54.890
I was just mad all the time.

14:54.980 --> 14:57.300
I don't know if it
was 'cause of dad,

14:57.360 --> 14:59.840
Or maybe it was just the way
I was wired. I don't know.

15:02.690 --> 15:04.980
I'm 50 years old now, man.

15:07.030 --> 15:08.210
I'm a different guy.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.020
I think I finally got a
handle on everything.

15:15.670 --> 15:16.420
You say so.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.190
What's that mean?

15:19.260 --> 15:20.680
I don't know,
you sneaked back into town,

15:20.710 --> 15:22.420
You know about me,
I don't know about you.

15:24.330 --> 15:26.200
I was trying to get
on my feet, man.

15:28.130 --> 15:32.250
Maybe get a nicer place before
I saw my little brother,

15:32.950 --> 15:34.230
Met my new niece.

15:34.930 --> 15:36.100
So hard to understand?

15:39.820 --> 15:40.510
No.

15:50.090 --> 15:51.410
I gotta ask you a question, paul.

15:54.590 --> 15:56.190
You ask me anything you want,
mr. Good.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.340
I'll give you a straight answer.

16:00.930 --> 16:03.440
You ever met a guy
named henry maynard?

16:10.350 --> 16:12.070
So that's what you're
doing here, huh?

16:15.080 --> 16:17.370
Checking on someone in
the perv posse, huh?

16:20.310 --> 16:23.210
Yeah, I know, uh, I know henry.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.480
I see him at my 12-step meetings.

16:25.540 --> 16:27.810
He seems... He seems
like an okay guy.

16:27.860 --> 16:29.100
Why, is he in some sort of trouble?

16:29.750 --> 16:30.660
You seen him lately?

16:32.020 --> 16:33.110
Last week, maybe.

16:33.950 --> 16:35.530
He's kind of fallen off the radar.

16:36.470 --> 16:39.100
His parole officer's getting
a little hysterical.

16:42.180 --> 16:45.610
You run into him,
you ask him to give me a call?

16:45.750 --> 16:46.480
Yeah, sure.

16:47.950 --> 16:49.490
I'll tell him to call
my brother, the cop.

16:49.940 --> 16:50.850
No problem.

17:03.660 --> 17:07.800
Get him! Get him! Strike!
Strike! Strike! Strike!

17:07.810 --> 17:09.940
Hmm, I guess that's why
they call it "Prevail."

17:11.520 --> 17:12.450
Just do me a favor.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.369
If I come up behind
you to give you a hug,

17:14.420 --> 17:16.420
Try not to karate-chop
me in the face.

17:16.450 --> 17:17.930
Kah! Kor! Hah!

17:18.079 --> 17:19.349
Play at your own risk.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.280
Hey, you know,
if it makes you feel better,

17:21.310 --> 17:22.829
They've got some classes for men.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.460
Isn't there some kind
of law against that?

17:25.510 --> 17:27.550
"One trained fighter per family"?

17:27.730 --> 17:30.380
No, the more the merrier.

17:30.580 --> 17:33.780
As far as I'm concerned,
somebody messes with a dubois,

17:34.350 --> 17:36.160
We can just tag-team him.

17:42.330 --> 17:42.950
What?

17:43.560 --> 17:46.330
Oh, you're smiling again,
you're joking again.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.100
Seems like you got
your confidence back.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.960
Something about this
woman in this class.

17:52.080 --> 17:52.980
I don't know what it is.

17:53.870 --> 17:54.880
It kind of gives me hope.

17:56.380 --> 17:56.880
I don't know.

17:56.940 --> 17:58.030
Maybe when I start the class,

17:58.080 --> 18:00.790
I'll think it's stupid,
or I'll be terrible at it.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.690
At least I'm doing something.

18:14.850 --> 18:18.310
Stop it! Stop fighting.

18:19.260 --> 18:19.970
Listen to me!

18:20.160 --> 18:22.160
This is only gonna get
worse if you keep fighting!

18:34.020 --> 18:35.460
Isn't the idea to
keep the splint on

18:35.460 --> 18:36.900
Until it stops hurting?

18:37.530 --> 18:38.370
Yeah, you caught me.

18:39.830 --> 18:41.540
The doctors told me to
keep it on for two weeks,

18:41.580 --> 18:43.030
But I don't know.

18:43.220 --> 18:45.390
I guess I'm just not happy
unless I'm hitting something.

18:47.020 --> 18:48.260
So what brings you by?

18:48.310 --> 18:49.500
Your class doesn't
start till next week.

18:51.890 --> 18:53.280
I found the man who attacked you.

18:54.150 --> 18:54.870
What?

18:55.810 --> 18:56.580
How?

18:57.040 --> 18:58.240
The "How's" Not important.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.890
What is important is,
I was able to go into work,

19:01.680 --> 19:02.620
And I was able to find him

19:02.670 --> 19:04.320
On the phoenix sex
offender registry.

19:04.470 --> 19:07.310
Turns out, this guy has a
history of sexual assault.

19:09.380 --> 19:12.940
Four years ago, he was convicted
of raping a 15-year-old girl.

19:13.400 --> 19:17.230
And they caught him, but he was
just paroled a few months ago.

19:18.070 --> 19:20.780
Turns out, he lives about
five miles from here.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.140
That's him, isn't it?

19:25.780 --> 19:26.940
That's the man who raped you.

19:29.260 --> 19:30.560
Uh, I don't know.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.990
I don't, I don't think so.

19:34.290 --> 19:36.870
It all happened so fast,
I never really got a good look at him.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.700
Ar-are you sure?

19:39.820 --> 19:42.350
Maybe you just blocked it out.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.970
Have another look at his picture.

19:44.020 --> 19:45.220
I haven't blocked out anything.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.580
I was raped and left
for dead, allison.

19:48.610 --> 19:51.280
Trust me,I remember every
detail of what happened.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.420
And I know that I never really saw

19:53.420 --> 19:54.140
The man who did it.

19:56.530 --> 19:58.470
Kira, we could send
this man back to prison.

19:59.290 --> 20:00.820
I know this is traumatic for you.

20:00.910 --> 20:02.120
It's not traumatic for me.

20:03.130 --> 20:04.230
It's annoying.

20:05.650 --> 20:06.250
You're wrong.

20:06.420 --> 20:07.560
You weren't there, I was.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.210
This man might be all the
things you say he is,

20:09.240 --> 20:10.250
But I can't tell you

20:10.300 --> 20:11.490
That that's the man
that attacked me.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.190
Class is next Tuesday.

20:16.210 --> 20:18.080
I hope to see you there.

20:20.390 --> 20:21.300
Believe it or not, allison,

20:21.330 --> 20:22.310
I got a full caseload.

20:22.340 --> 20:23.840
I don't really have time to reopen

20:23.880 --> 20:25.180
A six-year-old rape case,

20:25.230 --> 20:28.430
Where the victim can't make an I.D.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.530
Maybe we don't need a positive I.D.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.740
If they did a rape kit,

20:31.780 --> 20:33.910
Maybe we can convict this
guy on physical evidence.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.190
I saw it, lee. I saw it.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.880
I-I saw where he is,
I saw who he is.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.000
This is him? This is your rapist?

20:46.100 --> 20:48.100
Henry maynard,
he's a serial sex offender.

20:48.210 --> 20:49.740
No, actually, he's a cop.

20:50.900 --> 20:51.500
What?

20:51.830 --> 20:53.400
Henry maynard isn't
even his real name.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.130
It's an alias.

20:54.180 --> 20:55.050
He's sean riley.

20:55.490 --> 20:57.310
He's been working undercover
as a sex offender.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.380
That's why he's got a
profile on the registry.

20:59.940 --> 21:01.250
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
allison,

21:01.260 --> 21:02.820
But this guy didn't rape anybody.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.730
Go away.

21:13.030 --> 21:13.900
I just want to remind you

21:13.910 --> 21:15.860
There's no lifeguard
on duty after 11:00.

21:16.690 --> 21:17.690
Are you falling asleep in there?

21:17.840 --> 21:19.200
'cause I'm falling asleep out here.

21:20.770 --> 21:22.560
Hey, here's a crazy idea:
Let's go to bed,

21:22.560 --> 21:23.620
But let's do it in bed.

21:23.620 --> 21:26.630
Go ahead. No one's stopping you.

21:26.710 --> 21:27.630
Go to bed.

21:30.660 --> 21:31.910
Are those scented candles?

21:32.560 --> 21:34.300
What's that scent called,
"Self-pity"?

21:34.630 --> 21:38.190
it's close. "Self-loathing."

21:40.660 --> 21:41.880
I hate that smell on you.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.140
Well, we're both stuck
with it for a while.

21:44.330 --> 21:45.400
Any particular reason?

21:46.270 --> 21:47.980
What, you want to hear
about my day? Huh?

21:48.450 --> 21:49.930
Well, I went to see a
woman who'd been raped,

21:49.960 --> 21:52.220
And I tried to convince her I
knew more about it than she did.

21:52.460 --> 21:53.150
Nice.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.420
Yeah, well, to top it off,
I went to go see lee,

21:55.660 --> 22:00.070
And I identified a decorated
police officer as a rapist.

22:00.220 --> 22:01.920
Jeez, now I hate you, too.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.900
Allison, you have a concussion,

22:05.400 --> 22:08.280
And I'm betting this kira
person understands that,

22:08.380 --> 22:10.520
And I'm sure detective
scanlon does, too.

22:10.790 --> 22:14.080
You should have seen me running
into that police station

22:14.140 --> 22:15.860
Like I'd cracked this major case.

22:17.730 --> 22:19.450
God, if I only knew
all the awful things

22:19.450 --> 22:21.180
Lee was going through
with his brother...

22:22.440 --> 22:24.970
Before this afternoon,
did you even know he had a brother?

22:28.150 --> 22:29.700
Just give me ten more minutes.

23:09.820 --> 23:10.920
Allison called this morning.

23:12.700 --> 23:14.560
About an hour ago,
we found him in a shallow grave

23:14.560 --> 23:16.930
Just beyond the perimeter
of sky harbor airport.

23:17.490 --> 23:18.890
According to the medical examiner,

23:18.980 --> 23:20.630
His jaw's broken in three places.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.350
ribs are shattered.

23:23.610 --> 23:24.730
His skull's fractured.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.670
She thinks whoever did
this took their time.

23:27.810 --> 23:29.520
She thinks whoever did this
took some pleasure in it.

23:32.010 --> 23:32.630
What's this?

23:33.600 --> 23:34.560
Stun gun burns.

23:35.060 --> 23:37.690
Working theory is, the killer
came up behind him, stunned him,

23:38.180 --> 23:38.980
Then beat him to death.

23:41.380 --> 23:42.590
Lee, I need you to understand

23:42.720 --> 23:45.820
That now that detective riley's
cover is no longer an issue,

23:45.820 --> 23:46.700
I need to act.

23:46.710 --> 23:48.390
I'm going to bring in your
brother for questioning.

23:53.490 --> 23:54.250
Where am I?

23:55.160 --> 23:55.820
Excuse me?

23:55.950 --> 23:57.950
I want to be there
when you question him.

23:58.610 --> 23:59.150
Lee...

23:59.440 --> 24:00.500
I'm not talking about
running the interview.

24:00.500 --> 24:01.460
I just... I need to be able

24:01.460 --> 24:02.840
To see him when you talk to him.

24:03.290 --> 24:04.300
I can be in the observation room.

24:06.650 --> 24:08.910
I got to know if he tells you
the same story he told me.

24:12.770 --> 24:14.110
What do you mean,
the same story that he told you?

24:14.910 --> 24:15.810
I went to his apartment.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.320
I asked him if he
knew henry maynard.

24:19.340 --> 24:21.360
He told me he just met him.
He didn't seem alarmed.

24:21.410 --> 24:22.720
He didn't startle at the question.

24:23.230 --> 24:25.340
He sure as hell didn't act
like he knew he was a cop.

24:25.980 --> 24:27.690
Now, for what it's worth,
I believed him.

24:27.850 --> 24:29.330
I told you to stay out of this.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.410
Manny, you don't understand.
This is my big brother.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.360
If I was wrong about him,
if he did this to a cop,

24:35.410 --> 24:36.300
I need to be there.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.050
I'm sorry. I don't...

24:44.010 --> 24:45.640
I don't... I don't think I've
ever seen this girl before.

24:45.820 --> 24:48.600
Her name is kate hatton.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.950
Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry,
but none of this is familiar to me.

24:53.070 --> 24:53.660
Really?

24:53.950 --> 24:55.170
Why don't you take a closer look,

24:55.560 --> 24:58.290
Mr. Scanlon, because I'm pretty
sure you know who that girl is,

24:58.380 --> 25:00.140
And I'm almost certain
you know who the man is.

25:01.000 --> 25:01.970
One more look, please.

25:06.270 --> 25:07.240
I'm sorry, I...

25:08.550 --> 25:09.690
You don't recognize the tattoo?

25:10.710 --> 25:11.260
On who?

25:11.300 --> 25:12.170
On him.

25:13.590 --> 25:14.220
On you.

25:15.550 --> 25:16.180
On me?

25:18.380 --> 25:21.110
You think this is me 'cause of...
'cause of that tattoo?

25:21.400 --> 25:22.510
Are you denying that you have one

25:22.550 --> 25:23.950
Exactly like it on your right arm?

25:24.000 --> 25:24.930
That tattoo?

25:25.390 --> 25:27.320
There's a million guys
that got that tattoo.

25:28.650 --> 25:29.850
Look, I don't, I don't...

25:30.240 --> 25:32.240
I don't know who this guy is,
but it's not me.

25:33.290 --> 25:34.800
I've never seen that girl before.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.950
I've never been to this place,

25:36.980 --> 25:39.150
Wherever it is,
or wore a mask like that.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.300
You know, maybe you guys

25:41.320 --> 25:42.570
Just, uh...

25:43.450 --> 25:44.790
Want to pin this on a felon.

25:46.490 --> 25:48.570
Well, you can forget about that.

25:48.600 --> 25:49.790
I had nothing to do with this.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.050
Ever seen him?

25:54.600 --> 25:55.300
Sure.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.250
That's, uh, that's henry.

25:58.940 --> 26:00.150
Now, you want to talk about a guy

26:00.210 --> 26:02.580
Who's capable of doing
something like that...

26:02.870 --> 26:06.470
Mr. Scanlon, henry's
real name is sean riley.

26:06.510 --> 26:07.900
Detective sean riley.

26:07.940 --> 26:10.390
He's an undercover officer I
assigned to get close to you.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.120
Detective riley's body

26:13.150 --> 26:15.340
Was found near the
airport earlier today.

26:16.700 --> 26:17.740
He was beaten to death.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.020
Did he say something that
alerted you to the fact

26:21.060 --> 26:22.390
That he wasn't who he said he was?

26:28.250 --> 26:30.390
You think I had something
to do with killing a cop?

26:34.230 --> 26:35.580
My own brother's a cop.

26:38.450 --> 26:43.050
In fact, the other night,
he was asking me...

26:45.280 --> 26:46.470
About the same guy.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.430
Oh, man.

26:54.980 --> 26:55.980
Oh, man.

26:58.770 --> 27:00.260
He knew about this, didn't he?

27:01.760 --> 27:02.680
That you were trying to...

27:04.130 --> 27:05.970
Pin me for what
happened to this girl.

27:06.350 --> 27:07.600
Your brother has never
had anything to do

27:07.600 --> 27:08.960
With this investigation, sir.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.450
He's out there right now, isn't he?

27:11.890 --> 27:12.600
Hey!

27:13.560 --> 27:14.700
Hey, mr. Good!

27:17.130 --> 27:17.960
You're looking at me.

27:19.150 --> 27:19.900
Aren't you?

27:23.220 --> 27:24.250
What's the matter with you?

27:25.960 --> 27:26.680
I told you

27:26.720 --> 27:27.610
I'd changed!

27:58.020 --> 28:01.030
Hey! What? You didn't believe me,
baby brother?

28:01.490 --> 28:03.010
Couldn't convince your friends here

28:03.030 --> 28:04.300
They're after the wrong guy?

28:04.790 --> 28:07.080
Mr. Scanlon, I need you to
return to your seat now.

28:07.110 --> 28:08.380
Your brother's not out there.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.370
Thanks for all your help, mr. Good.

28:11.830 --> 28:14.300
Great to know you were there
for me when I needed you.

28:14.580 --> 28:15.890
All right, mr. Scanlon.

28:15.950 --> 28:17.250
I need you to return to your seat.

28:22.030 --> 28:22.890
So, what's the verdict?

28:27.200 --> 28:28.510
Um, well, yeah.

28:28.620 --> 28:29.980
It's, it's good, I guess.

28:30.210 --> 28:31.530
I mean, he, uh...

28:31.670 --> 28:32.690
They-they can't keep him.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.350
They can't prove anything.

28:35.230 --> 28:38.030
He-he just kept saying he
didn't do it, any of it.

28:39.620 --> 28:40.410
What do you say?

28:42.830 --> 28:45.180
You know, after that beating
I took the other night,

28:45.220 --> 28:46.510
I still have a concussion.

28:50.770 --> 28:53.010
Hey. Tell me what you saw.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.760
Did he kill him? Did my
brother kill that detective?

28:57.570 --> 28:58.490
I didn't see that.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.120
What about the girl?
Did you see him with the girl?

29:05.790 --> 29:07.390
That's my brother in
that video, right?

29:25.400 --> 29:25.990
Hey.

29:27.150 --> 29:27.900
My baby brother.

29:29.420 --> 29:31.030
Big, brave police guy.

29:31.250 --> 29:31.970
What you doing?

29:33.030 --> 29:34.620
Shouldn't you be hiding
behind a one-way mirror?

29:40.730 --> 29:42.760
Now, you look me in the eye
and tell me what's going on.

29:42.820 --> 29:43.690
What's going on with what?

29:43.930 --> 29:44.760
Did you rape that girl?

29:44.800 --> 29:45.500
No!

29:45.810 --> 29:46.760
Did you kill that detective?

29:46.790 --> 29:48.390
Oh, for god sakes, no.
Put that gun away.

29:48.540 --> 29:50.410
You raped her, didn't you,
you fat weasel?

29:50.680 --> 29:52.590
And when you realized that
cop was on your trail,

29:52.630 --> 29:53.870
You beat him to death, didn't you?

29:54.350 --> 29:55.070
Didn't you?!

29:55.230 --> 29:56.420
Damn it, lee. Look at me.

29:57.230 --> 29:58.940
I'm your brother.
I'm your flesh and blood.

29:58.970 --> 30:00.270
I'm looking you right in the eye.

30:01.340 --> 30:03.070
I didn't do it. Any of it.

30:03.110 --> 30:04.060
I swear to god.

30:05.190 --> 30:07.150
I went to prison,
lee, for nine years.

30:07.170 --> 30:08.980
When I got out,
I made a promise to myself

30:09.020 --> 30:11.980
That I would never,
ever hurt another person.

30:12.050 --> 30:16.100
I would never, ever force
myself on another human being.

30:16.260 --> 30:17.930
And I swear to god, I haven't.

30:19.450 --> 30:20.680
Go ahead, shoot.

30:21.380 --> 30:22.560
It'd be a relief.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.620
But I didn't do it, lee.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.240
Know why I came back to phoenix,
baby brother?

30:49.400 --> 30:50.730
'cause I heard you had that kid.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.350
I've been alone all my life, lee.
I got nothing.

31:01.580 --> 31:03.390
And I just thought maybe,
you know...

31:05.210 --> 31:08.350
Maybe I could get a little
something of what you have.

31:14.350 --> 31:15.490
Stupid, right?

31:22.530 --> 31:23.260
Not stupid.

31:25.140 --> 31:25.960
It's not stupid.

32:11.640 --> 32:12.360
You're awake.

32:13.200 --> 32:13.790
That's good.

32:15.230 --> 32:16.170
I guess we can get started.

32:17.770 --> 32:18.510
You're scared, right?

32:19.920 --> 32:20.880
You're wondering who I am?

32:21.970 --> 32:22.870
Why I'm doing this to you?

32:24.530 --> 32:26.330
After all, you've
never seen me before.

32:27.290 --> 32:28.230
You don't know me at all.

32:30.250 --> 32:34.230
But I know you... Henry Maynard.

32:35.810 --> 32:37.020
You've got the wrong person.

32:37.560 --> 32:39.250
Read all about you on
my favorite web site.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.810
You raped a 15-year-old girl.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.800
No.

32:48.670 --> 32:49.840
I'm not gonna lie to you, henry.

32:51.130 --> 32:52.060
You're going to die tonight.

32:53.260 --> 32:54.130
I'm going to kill you.

32:55.530 --> 32:56.290
But first...

32:57.150 --> 32:58.800
I'm going to teach you
what it really means

32:59.310 --> 33:00.110
To be a victim.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.430
Stop it! Stop fighting.

33:18.150 --> 33:18.830
Listen to me.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.160
This is only gonna get
worse if you keep fighting.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.010
Stop fighting?

33:27.050 --> 33:28.080
That's a good one, henry.

33:37.140 --> 33:37.880
It still hurt?

33:39.970 --> 33:40.660
I can deal with it.

33:46.820 --> 33:47.470
What's this?

33:48.720 --> 33:50.500
More sex offenders you
think may have hurt me?

33:51.200 --> 33:52.050
Or vice versa.

33:53.290 --> 33:55.020
All these men have
dropped out of sight,

33:55.020 --> 33:57.110
Stopped checking in with
their parole officers.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.980
Those men are never
gonna show up, are they?

34:00.890 --> 34:02.260
You made sure of that, didn't you?

34:03.510 --> 34:04.860
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

34:06.770 --> 34:07.620
Well, this last man

34:07.670 --> 34:09.310
That you murdered, henry maynard...

34:10.550 --> 34:11.940
Not a sex offender.

34:13.090 --> 34:13.940
Not really.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.000
He was an undercover

34:16.340 --> 34:17.270
Vice detective.

34:18.190 --> 34:21.570
He was somebody's husband,
he was somebody's father.

34:23.600 --> 34:24.929
What, you didn't... You didn't know

34:25.000 --> 34:27.449
That the... The police
put up fake histories

34:27.690 --> 34:30.040
For their undercover
officers on the sex registry?

34:30.090 --> 34:30.960
Well, they do.

34:34.630 --> 34:35.409
One last time--

34:36.449 --> 34:38.239
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

34:39.370 --> 34:40.190
Hey, guys.

34:47.010 --> 34:47.900
So what happens now?

34:50.840 --> 34:51.870
You gonna arrest me?

34:53.760 --> 34:54.510
By yourself?

34:56.920 --> 34:57.710
Yeah, I didn't think so.

34:59.690 --> 35:01.400
That would require proof,

35:03.280 --> 35:04.780
That would require muscle--

35:06.380 --> 35:07.970
Neither of which you have.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.010
You coming to class?

35:13.140 --> 35:13.920
I'm gonna pass.

35:30.070 --> 35:30.780
Nice.

35:34.370 --> 35:35.040
It's quiet.

35:37.930 --> 35:40.870
Where's, uh... Where's your fianc?

35:40.870 --> 35:41.760
Where's the...

35:42.280 --> 35:42.950
Where's the baby?

35:43.010 --> 35:44.240
I thought we were all, uh...

35:44.910 --> 35:46.000
All having dinner together.

35:46.150 --> 35:46.900
I sent them away.

35:52.700 --> 35:53.670
You know what I did today?

35:55.270 --> 35:57.980
I watched that video of the
teenage girl getting raped.

35:59.580 --> 36:00.290
Oh, man.

36:01.550 --> 36:02.770
Wh-why would you do that?

36:03.630 --> 36:05.370
'cause my big brother
told me it wasn't him.

36:07.370 --> 36:09.970
I figured the quicker I
figure out who it really was,

36:10.010 --> 36:11.590
The quicker you could
get on with your life

36:11.620 --> 36:13.880
Without everybody looking
over your shoulder.

36:19.830 --> 36:23.370
The guy in that video,
he had that girl on the bed.

36:24.310 --> 36:26.690
Kind of hesitated before
he got down to business,

36:26.740 --> 36:27.770
Like he was nervous.

36:28.890 --> 36:30.430
He just stood there
looking down at her,

36:31.270 --> 36:32.230
Bending his thumb back.

36:32.290 --> 36:34.630
He kept bending his thumb
back all the way to his wrist.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.370
Guess the guy was double-jointed.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.670
And it made me think of you, paul.

36:46.190 --> 36:47.130
You're double-jointed.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.450
Well, a lot of guys
are double-jointed.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.740
No, no, I know, but I don't
know them; I know you.

36:54.460 --> 36:56.600
And I remember how back
when dad used to get drunk

36:56.650 --> 36:58.870
And raring to hit someone,
you'd just lay there on your bed

36:58.930 --> 37:00.590
Bending your thumb back
over and over again.

37:04.490 --> 37:06.020
You shouldn't have
watched that video.

37:08.610 --> 37:09.370
I don't know why

37:09.430 --> 37:10.760
You'd want something
like that in your head.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.540
One-time offer.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.430
Ride down to the station with me.

37:16.460 --> 37:18.290
Admit what you did.
I will stand by you.

37:22.290 --> 37:23.000
Really?

37:27.830 --> 37:29.000
You're going to stand by me?

37:31.700 --> 37:32.850
You gonna go to prison with me?

37:34.460 --> 37:35.220
I'll get you help.

37:37.840 --> 37:38.940
Whatever you need to get better.

37:41.930 --> 37:43.520
You don't get it, mr. Good, do you?

37:45.460 --> 37:46.720
I don't need help.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.570
I don't want help.

37:51.190 --> 37:52.130
I'm fine.

37:54.260 --> 37:55.020
I like me.

37:57.970 --> 38:00.410
All the cops and the social workers

38:00.460 --> 38:01.430
And the parole officers.

38:01.470 --> 38:03.970
You know, all that, all that system

38:04.030 --> 38:06.080
That you couldn't wait to
sign up to be a part of?

38:07.980 --> 38:10.960
You guys all had your
crack at helping me.

38:11.930 --> 38:13.320
It didn't take.

38:15.770 --> 38:17.310
'cause there's
nothing really wrong.

38:21.120 --> 38:26.160
I'm just... Like... You.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.060
But I'll tell you...

38:34.600 --> 38:35.970
I'll tell you something,
baby brother.

38:36.470 --> 38:37.160
you want me to...

38:38.050 --> 38:39.880
You want to take me downtown,
baby brother?

38:40.870 --> 38:43.070
Hmm? Want to charge me with,
um, with what?

38:44.060 --> 38:45.520
Being double-jointed?

38:47.770 --> 38:48.840
I'll stand by you.

38:54.260 --> 38:54.880
No?

39:00.560 --> 39:01.830
Well, I'll tell you what.

39:02.560 --> 39:03.460
If you change your mind...

39:08.090 --> 39:09.030
...You know where I live.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.790
Looks like you want to
say something to me.

39:18.610 --> 39:19.360
I don't blame you.

39:20.700 --> 39:22.160
I'd do the same
thing in your shoes.

39:24.630 --> 39:25.750
I got it all wrong, right?

39:27.520 --> 39:28.330
You're really a good guy.

39:30.390 --> 39:31.460
I've heard it all before.

39:32.810 --> 39:33.560
All of it.

39:36.850 --> 39:38.050
You deserve this.

39:39.410 --> 39:40.490
You know that.

39:41.810 --> 39:45.430
Try to accept it with
some kind of dignity.

39:59.190 --> 39:59.860
Hey, Allison.

40:00.430 --> 40:03.860
Look, lee. I know we
didn't have enough evidence

40:03.870 --> 40:05.670
To bring in that woman
Kira for questioning.

40:05.680 --> 40:08.160
But please, please tell me
that you meant it when you said

40:08.170 --> 40:09.950
You were going to have
somebody watching her.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.480
Uh, yeah, we got a night shift
detective on her right now.

40:12.550 --> 40:13.180
Why?

40:13.830 --> 40:15.090
She's going after your brother.

40:18.020 --> 40:18.630
What?

40:19.060 --> 40:19.920
I just saw it, Lee.

40:21.060 --> 40:22.020
I saw it, um...

40:22.280 --> 40:23.610
I don't know when
it's going to happen,

40:23.670 --> 40:24.750
But I think it's
going to happen soon.

40:25.170 --> 40:27.070
She-she has a broken knuckle,

40:27.120 --> 40:28.460
And she still had it in my dream.

40:32.220 --> 40:34.360
Um, okay. We've got
it covered, allison.

40:34.430 --> 40:36.130
If kira goes after paul,
we'll pick her up.

40:37.510 --> 40:39.060
Thanks for the heads-up, though.

41:00.430 --> 41:02.010
Hi. What are you doing here?

41:02.010 --> 41:04.360
I still have another,
uh, two hours.

41:05.220 --> 41:06.010
I couldn't sleep.

41:06.310 --> 41:07.940
Figured there's no point
in us both suffering.

41:08.840 --> 41:09.540
You serious?

41:10.430 --> 41:11.160
I'm here, right?

41:11.670 --> 41:13.420
You're relieved.
Go home. Eat. Sleep.

41:14.710 --> 41:15.880
Copy that, detective.

41:16.710 --> 41:17.710
Much obliged.

41:20.170 --> 41:20.770
See ya.

42:17.680 --> 42:18.390
Scanlon : What's up?

42:18.980 --> 42:19.710
Allison : Lee.

42:20.170 --> 42:21.190
I just couldn't sleep.

42:21.350 --> 42:23.080
Please just tell me
everything's all right with you.

42:24.770 --> 42:25.790
Paul's dead, Allison.

42:26.650 --> 42:27.370
What?

42:27.680 --> 42:29.860
We picked that woman up on her
way out of my brother's place.

42:30.570 --> 42:32.100
She got to him before
we could stop her.

42:33.230 --> 42:35.440
I guess our guy must have
gotten distracted or something.

42:37.410 --> 42:40.890
They were, uh,
too late to help my brother.

42:41.370 --> 42:42.270
Oh, my god.

42:42.840 --> 42:45.020
The good news is,
we had her dead to rights.

42:45.590 --> 42:47.030
She's going away for a long time.

42:47.960 --> 42:49.460
I'm so sorry, lee.

42:50.450 --> 42:51.970
Yeah. Me, too.

42:51.971 --> 43:01.971
