01:04.522 --> 01:07.524
New Orleans, good morning.
It's Rod Ryan with you.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.110
Coming up, tickets for the
Voodoo Fest coming to...

01:10.195 --> 01:14.156
...to the banks of the Mississippi,
from Baton Rouge to Bayou Boutin.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.158
This is Hooks checking
news headlines.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.410
...good day to be in New Orleans...

01:22.332 --> 01:24.374
How's the birthday boy?

01:29.005 --> 01:31.673
- This is for Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.468
- Look at Grandpa. Say hi.
- Open my present.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.888
Want to open a present?

01:44.229 --> 01:46.271
- Good morning, Mr. Wood.
- Morning.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.773
Paper.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.609
Thank you.
How was your weekend?

01:50.693 --> 01:53.946
- Great. How was yours?
- Very nice. How are the kids?

01:54.030 --> 01:55.030
Great.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.784
Magic trick. Henry!

02:00.120 --> 02:01.703
- Jacob.
- Ted. Good Morning.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.664
- It's happening.
- What's happening?

02:03.748 --> 02:07.459
Does your car have a radio?
Greenspan's speech was delayed.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.963
Rumor is he's sick. Looks like end
of the world is factored into prices.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.590
Everyone in the conference room
in 10 minutes.

02:13.675 --> 02:18.303
Deborah, I need you for five minutes.
Ted, it's Monday. There'll be a Tuesday.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.891
You have a call about the antitrust
approvals with Harry at 11.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.560
Close the door, please.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.066
How'd Henry's party go?

02:32.360 --> 02:34.570
- Terrific. He had a great time.
- Good.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.575
I have a problem.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.869
Okay. What is it?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.466
He taught me a song for his birthday.

02:56.551 --> 03:00.846
I have to sing it for him tonight
at bedtime, and I can't think what it is.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.765
Sing a little more and we'll figure it out.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.078
What the hell was that?

03:26.289 --> 03:29.124
- Oh, my God!
- Call 911!

03:30.752 --> 03:33.462
-911.
- I want to report a shooting.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.849
- Get behind the desk and stay there!
- Ma'am?

03:46.184 --> 03:48.227
The Laurel Morgan Building.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.229
- Third floor.
- How many are injured?

03:50.313 --> 03:54.066
I don't know. I don't know
how many... No, stay with me!

03:54.150 --> 03:57.527
- God! They put me on hold. Hello?
- Oh, shit.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.405
- Come on, somebody...
- Calm down.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.992
- Can you see anything?
- It'll be fine. I promise.

04:04.077 --> 04:08.413
Hello?

04:15.463 --> 04:18.089
Come on.
Please send somebody.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.886
Pick up. Please pick up.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.717
- Good morning, Mr. Pulaski.
- Morning, Nick.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.469
Need some help with that?

05:04.554 --> 05:08.974
The bilge ring keeps crapping out,
blocking up the damn pump. I got it.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.852
Last time you nearly took out
every sink in the Quarter.

05:11.936 --> 05:15.063
That was those kids messing
with the water main.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.401
- You should really quit those things.
- What for?

05:51.100 --> 05:53.560
Christmas comes a little early this year.

06:00.526 --> 06:03.653
There's our boy.
So, what do you say?

06:03.738 --> 06:07.991
- Does he stop in for coffee and a cruller?
- Let's give him a cruller.

06:08.868 --> 06:13.330
- Bingo! We have a winner.
- I can smell the fried dough over here.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.457
And there he is.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.627
Breakfast of champions, right there.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.469
We're losing him.
I'll take just a couple more.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.847
Say goodbye to Mr. Nicholas Easter.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.266
Who's next on the hit parade?

06:44.195 --> 06:45.237
Hi.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.574
Can I look at that candle?

06:51.577 --> 06:53.412
No, I'm sorry, the red one.

06:53.496 --> 06:57.833
Just to the left of that scary pentacle
and the jar of bloodroot.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.459
Right there.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.092
Thank you. What'd you say?

07:07.176 --> 07:09.928
She's Cajun. I told her you wanted
the St. Nicholas candle.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.764
- Is that what you wanted?
- That's the one.

07:16.894 --> 07:19.146
What happened right there?
What did she say?

07:19.230 --> 07:22.274
She said you're nice-looking,
but she doesn't trust you.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.109
She didn't say that, did she?

07:25.069 --> 07:26.695
You know what it is?

07:28.156 --> 07:30.782
Jury duty.
I got a summons in the mail.

07:31.617 --> 07:35.078
- I was trying to pray out of it.
- Where's your sense of civic duty?

07:36.622 --> 07:38.331
I flunked civics.

07:38.958 --> 07:43.753
- Do you have any other tips?
- I would go with a St. Catherine candle.

07:44.755 --> 07:45.839
What does she do?

07:45.923 --> 07:49.342
She's the patron saint
of unmarried women and jurors.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.428
- Really?
- Really.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.222
That's not what
that candle really is, is it?

08:09.489 --> 08:13.575
- This your first time in New Orleans?
- No, no.

08:13.868 --> 08:18.497
- I've been here a number of times.
- I had you pegged as a first-timer.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.957
Is that right?

08:21.042 --> 08:22.459
Yeah.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.427
- How's your mother?
- Excuse me?

08:33.261 --> 08:37.057
- She feeling better?
- How do you know about my mother?

08:37.350 --> 08:40.143
She was in the hospital.
Now you care for her at home.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.356
- She had a stroke.
- Your wife wants to put her in a home...

08:44.440 --> 08:47.817
...but you're feeling guilty about that.
You've checked out a few of them...

08:47.902 --> 08:50.904
...and it doesn't feel
like the Christian thing to do.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.449
My advice, reconsider the home.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.161
Better an unhappy mother
than an unfriendly wife.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.665
I'm up here on the right.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.922
...the same thing with guns
and Vicksburg Firearms.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.132
The only thing
that's gonna win this case...

09:11.217 --> 09:14.719
...is because for the first time,
we got a gun company ex-executive...

09:14.804 --> 09:17.055
...who's gonna go up
against his former employer...

09:17.139 --> 09:20.058
...and with good conscience,
he's gonna testify for us.

09:21.102 --> 09:25.981
I promised Celeste that I would win it for
her and all the others that died that day.

09:26.065 --> 09:29.359
You're gonna make history, Celeste.
We're gonna do it together.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.194
Thank you for your courage.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.414
We got the Strickland SUV
case at noon.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.333
And Celeste, I'll see you
and your son at Arno's at 6.

09:45.459 --> 09:47.669
- As long as we don't...
- Nothing about the case.

09:47.753 --> 09:51.006
This is dinner with you and Henry.
Got time to see her to her car?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.716
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.843
- Mr. Rohr.
- Yeah.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.262
Lawrence Green.
Lindus, Hostetler...

09:57.346 --> 10:00.890
Hostetler. Yes, jury consultants,
New York City.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.143
Philadelphia.
Thank you for meeting with me.

10:03.227 --> 10:06.187
Guess how many phone calls
and letters I get...

10:06.272 --> 10:08.898
...from expert jury consultants
such as yourself.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.276
- I can imagine, sir.
- Go on, take a guess.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.403
I appreciate you inviting me here.

10:13.487 --> 10:17.115
- This is more important now. Which one?
- I'm sorry?

10:17.199 --> 10:19.451
I'm off to court.
This is the striped.

10:19.535 --> 10:23.288
- Non-striped? Striped? Non-striped?
- The striped matches yourjacket.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.415
Yours is striped because
you're from New York.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.126
- Philadelphia.
- I'm gonna go with the non-striped.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.254
As a cleverjury consultant,
you should know...

10:31.339 --> 10:34.883
...that jurors down here don't trust
a lawyer who's too nattily turned out.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.428
- How familiar are you with my case?
- Very, sir.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.597
- You think it's a strong case?
- Yes, sir.

10:40.681 --> 10:44.768
- Do you think it's a winning case?
- People don't win gun cases, Mr. Rohr.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.355
I think I can help you with that, sir.

10:50.399 --> 10:55.153
There's gotta be another commuter flight.
Can you try one in Richmond or Atlanta?

10:56.614 --> 10:59.115
I gotta call you back. He's here.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.579
You represent the widow of a man
shot by a Vicksburg Firearms gun.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.915
They're finding out things about jurors...

11:06.999 --> 11:09.459
- ... their spouses don't know.
- Is that right?

11:09.543 --> 11:12.212
And the word is the defense
has retained...

11:12.296 --> 11:16.591
- Rankin Fitch as their lead jury consultant.
- Rankin Fitch?

11:17.176 --> 11:18.218
- You don't...?
- I know who he is.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.182
Mr. Fitch, how was your flight?

11:24.266 --> 11:26.393
Fine. Are we up and running, Miss Monroe?

11:26.477 --> 11:30.939
We are. Kaufman's inside with Birk,
and the kid from MIT, Lamb, is here.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.024
What about Broussard,
forensic linguistics?

11:33.109 --> 11:37.028
Out of Rochester.
He missed his flight. He'll be here by 3.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.030
- Who's our backup?
- He'll be here by 3.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.991
- Who is our backup?
- Levon Raines out of Dallas.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.787
Call Mr. Broussard. Tell him
his service is no longer required.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.916
- See what time Raines can be here.
- Yes, sir.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.668
Mr. Fitch.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.470
Tell me why I need a jury consultant.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.223
Fitch will scientifically
pick jurors predisposed...

12:05.307 --> 12:09.227
...in his favor by using surveillance,
wiretaps, psych profiles, graphology...

12:09.311 --> 12:11.229
- Where's my car?
- Where you parked it.

12:11.313 --> 12:14.899
- We're going together.
- Sir, I have a master's in psychology...

12:14.984 --> 12:18.820
...from the University of Chicago. I know
handwriting. I know this stuff, I really do.

12:22.283 --> 12:26.244
Delores Kinnerly, registered Democrat,
46 years of age, unmarried...

12:26.328 --> 12:29.622
...occupational therapist, devout cat lover.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.667
Look how she turns
from the man walking his dog.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.504
- She's self-conscious about her weight.
- Maybe she just hates dogs.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.382
- Good morning.
- Morning.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.009
Freeze that, Mr. Lamb.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.973
We love fat women, people.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.060
They're tight-fisted, unsympathetic.

12:51.145 --> 12:56.441
I want her on my jury. Let's find 11 more
jurors and three alternates just like her.

12:56.525 --> 13:00.111
- Who's next?
- Jerry Fernandez, 40, Puerto Rican...

13:00.196 --> 13:03.782
- ... works for a moving company.
- I got 35 years experience in courtrooms...

13:03.866 --> 13:07.452
...and my instincts for picking juries
have served me nicely so far.

13:07.536 --> 13:11.790
- I wanna thank you for your time.
- I flew down here on my own dime.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.917
- Why?
- Because I...

13:14.585 --> 13:18.296
- Because I believe in this case.
- Why?

13:18.714 --> 13:23.885
- I believe in a world without guns.
- That's very sweet, but naive.

13:28.891 --> 13:32.477
- Thirty percent.
- I'm sorry. Excuse me?

13:32.561 --> 13:36.689
Thirty percent of your usual fee.
You're hired, strictly probationary status.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.901
- You don't want to check out my resume?
- Already did.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.569
It's impressive.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.366
- Here's your thing.
- What do you got?

13:46.909 --> 13:48.827
- "The following are exempt:
- I read it.

13:48.911 --> 13:53.122
- Not a resident of New Orleans... "
- That won't work. What am I gonna say?

13:53.207 --> 13:54.916
I'm gonna tell them
I'll pack and leave?

13:55.000 --> 13:59.003
Number two. Pack up and leave?
You ain't got nothing to pack.

13:59.088 --> 14:02.382
No, it's true. They own you.
One thing you can do.

14:02.466 --> 14:03.591
Leave the country.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.636
- Why am I gonna leave?
- Church convention.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.556
Sex change. You're leaving
because you're becoming a woman.

14:10.474 --> 14:13.351
- You own a goat farm.
- This thing is a disaster.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.019
I got my life and work.

14:15.104 --> 14:19.023
- And I got my training. The Challenge.
- Oh, wait a sec.

14:19.108 --> 14:22.068
- You could claim hardship.
- It's 8 weeks away. I can't do it.

14:22.152 --> 14:25.029
- I can't do it.
- You got the Challenge. You can't go.

14:25.114 --> 14:29.075
Hold on, check this.
"If you have been convicted of a felony... "

14:29.159 --> 14:30.952
Have you been convicted of a felony?

14:31.203 --> 14:33.204
- No.
- You should commit a felony.

14:33.664 --> 14:36.249
- Commit a crime.
- Are you serious?

14:36.333 --> 14:38.835
It doesn't have to be a bad crime.

14:38.919 --> 14:42.213
- I should commit a crime?
- You're asking to get out of it, right?

14:43.007 --> 14:44.674
You registered to vote.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.635
If you register to vote,
then they got you in the jury pool.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.346
We need to de-register him.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.474
One day, I'm gonna organize,
throw half this stuff away.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.227
What's that, Walther PPK?
That's a nice piece.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.063
That's the same gun James Bond uses.
You know that?

14:59.148 --> 15:01.733
Really? You can't be too safe these days.

15:01.817 --> 15:05.278
- Walking on the streets, all alone.
- Smooth, Maxine.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.281
It's easier to find an honest firearm
these days than a good man.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.577
- Know how to use it?
- My brother took me to the dump once.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.621
Let me take you down
to the firing range.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.081
- Thattaboy.
- I'll show you how to shoot.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.918
- I got a few ideas.
- I bet.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.211
Nice job, Maxine.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.840
Frank Herrera, Cuban, 43 years old...

15:25.925 --> 15:29.636
...retired Marine sergeant, served
in Panama and Grenada, twice divorced.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.846
Now he cleans swimming pools.

15:32.348 --> 15:35.516
Fair to say he misses
his former position of authority.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.895
I think Herrera would make
a good foreman. Don't you, Mr. Cable?

15:38.979 --> 15:44.984
I'm only lead counsel for the defense. I
don't pretend to know about jury selection.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.569
- Really?
- Really.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.572
- Who's next?
- Nicholas Easter.

15:49.657 --> 15:53.284
Thirty-four, co-manager of Game Trader
in the Esplanade Mall.

15:53.869 --> 15:56.621
- He's gonna love this.
- Watch me hit this lady in the head.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.457
- See how her head explodes?
- It explodes.

15:59.541 --> 16:02.085
Don't hit her. Hit the bad guy.

16:02.169 --> 16:05.046
- I can try? Show me how to hold it.
- Give it a shot.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.382
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.717
I threw in this little sniper game.

16:09.885 --> 16:13.554
- I thought you might like it.
- I wrote down my phone number.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.724
Oh, okay. That's a local number.
You're here.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.226
- We're close.
- Right on.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.561
Perfect. I'm Maxine.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.896
I'm Nick Easter.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.524
He calls himself a part-time student.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.360
- At Tulane? City College?
- Currently, nowhere.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.988
So he's lying. Where's he from?

16:30.072 --> 16:32.198
Moved here eight months ago.
Trail's cold.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.868
He dropped out of the sky
like the Archangel Gabriel?

16:36.245 --> 16:40.164
Put him on a jury with Herrera, he's gonna
be doing dog tricks in five minutes.

16:40.249 --> 16:45.003
Without reviewing his questionnaire,
a formal Q&A, I don't think I can trust this.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.172
You're only lead counsel
for the defense.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.009
You shouldn't pretend to know much
about jury selection.

16:51.593 --> 16:55.763
Nicholas Easter, he's an entertainer.
He wants to make everybody happy.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.058
Not a bad way to go through life,
making everybody happy.

17:00.102 --> 17:04.564
But in court, it's not that simple.
Somebody always loses.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.276
Just not me. He's a risk.

17:08.609 --> 17:09.861
Let's move on.

17:10.738 --> 17:14.991
The case stems from the shooting death of
stockbroker Jacob Wood two years ago.

17:15.075 --> 17:18.368
Seating a panel won't be easy
in this highly-watched...

17:18.454 --> 17:22.205
...politically-charged trial that begins
with jury selection.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.709
On the defense, Vicksburg Firearms.

17:24.792 --> 17:27.627
Attorneys will begin questioning
potential jurors today...

17:27.713 --> 17:31.632
The gun industry hasn't lost in court,
but the man leading this fight...

17:31.717 --> 17:33.634
...attorney Wendall Rohr,
says it'll be different.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.679
He says this time the gun industry
will pay.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.683
It's not sticking. I need the other tape.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.312
- Know what you're doing?
- Good to go.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.606
Could I get your glasses? Perfect.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.984
Same prescription. The frames
will feel a little heavier.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.360
Come on.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.155
Right side of the table. Keep it square.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.491
Keep it clear. Mr. Cable.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.870
I'm gonna be putting
this behind your ear.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.872
- What is that?
- It ain't Dramamine.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.665
Right there. All set.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.417
- You done?
- I am.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.195
Mr. Rohr.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.995
- Can you smell that?
- Two-hundred-year-old mahogany.

18:44.498 --> 18:48.501
Furniture polish, cheap cologne
and body odor.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.047
Wendall.

19:23.579 --> 19:27.165
- How you doing? I'm Nick.
- Lydia.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.793
So, what are we supposed to do,
sit here all day? Is that it?

19:31.170 --> 19:35.131
- What do they want us to do?
- I'm sure we can think of something.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.424
All rise.

19:40.929 --> 19:45.516
Oyez, oyez, oyez, civil district court
for the parish of Orleans is now in session.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.186
The Honorable Frederick Buford Harkins
presiding.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.897
God save the state
and this honorable court.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.274
Thank you, bailiff.
You may take your seats.

20:00.616 --> 20:04.994
- This suit is brought by plaintiffs...
- Over your left shoulder. Rankin Fitch, 2:00.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.372
Dark suit. You've heard the myth,
now meet the man.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.000
Quaking in my Florsheims.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.587
Celeste Wood claims
that Vicksburg Firearms is liable...

20:14.671 --> 20:19.342
...for her husband's death and seeks
damages for loss of future earnings...

20:19.801 --> 20:22.511
...as well as general damages,
including pain and suffering.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.306
Plaintiff has exercised
her right to a jury trial.

20:25.390 --> 20:29.852
- We are now ready to begin the voir dire.
- Miss Coleman.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.355
- Mrs.
- Mrs. Coleman, excuse me.

20:32.439 --> 20:37.151
I see from your questionnaire that you
have no particular feeling about guns...

20:37.444 --> 20:41.239
- Briefcase on the jury.
- Yes, sir, that's correct.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.492
I don't feel one way
or another about guns...

20:44.576 --> 20:48.246
- ... but I sure hate to see people get hurt.
- I understand.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.082
- Do you or your husband own a gun?
- We do not.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.584
Ever fired a gun for sport?

20:54.127 --> 20:55.211
Or in self-defense?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.172
Shoulder shrug.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.676
She's evaluating the person
asking the question before she answers.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.595
She's telling Rohr exactly
what he wants to hear.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.181
- You think she's lying.
- Not necessarily.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.434
- She knows how to.
- Rikki Coleman, 36 years of age.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.561
Her husband's a Baptist minister.

21:12.938 --> 21:16.649
She's a card-carrying member of the
Sierra Club and a registered Democrat.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.652
I hate Baptists almost
as much as I hate Democrats.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.321
- What else?
- She had an abortion two years ago.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.157
- And? And?
- The guy holding her hand at the clinic...

21:25.242 --> 21:26.784
...not the Baptist minister.

21:31.873 --> 21:34.542
Tone of voice, body language,
she's got an open mind.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.837
She's gonna be fair
and sympathetic to Mrs. Wood.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.548
Mr. Rohr, do you wish
to exercise challenge for cause?

21:40.632 --> 21:44.093
- No, Your Honor. We accept this juror.
- Mr. Cable?

21:44.720 --> 21:47.513
- Take her. Take her.
- No objections here, Your Honor.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.432
Enter Mrs. Coleman as a juror.

21:49.516 --> 21:53.227
I'm co-manager of Circle Foods.
It's a local grocery chain.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.771
I've been living here about 14 years.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.942
Circle Foods. Take him, Mr. Cable.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.988
- We accept this juror, Your Honor.
- Mr. Rohr?

22:07.659 --> 22:09.910
- No objections, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.538
You may enter Mr. Shaver as a juror.
Next!

22:12.622 --> 22:14.957
Prison for those people who break the law.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.542
Your Honor, we'll accept this juror.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.669
- She looks good.
- No objections.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.297
- Enter Miss Hullic.
- They flooding the community...

22:21.381 --> 22:23.424
- No objection.
- No. No. No.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.426
- Peremptory challenge.
- What are your grounds?

22:25.510 --> 22:27.136
- We accept.
- Mr. Rohr?

22:27.220 --> 22:28.679
- No objections.
- We accept.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.681
- You have a gun?
- I'm thinking about it.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.641
- You may go.
- Mossburg pump.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.770
I like him! Yes! Let's take him.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.688
- We accept this juror.
- No objection.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.732
- Herrera as a juror.
- I'm a mechanic.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.943
- What about gun control?
- Same way I feel about birth control.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.320
- Doesn't work.
- We accept.

22:44.404 --> 22:48.074
- Enter Eddie Weese as a juror.
- Yes, definitely.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.367
- No challenge.
- We accept this juror.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.036
- Call me Millie. I'm a sculptress.
- Accepted.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.038
- Take her.
- DeShazo as a juror.

22:54.122 --> 22:56.499
- We accept Ms. Deets as a juror.
- We accept this juror.

22:56.583 --> 22:59.585
- An AK-47 overstates the case.
- I want her.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.170
- I want her.
- No objection.

23:01.254 --> 23:03.923
- Lembeck as a juror. Mr. Cable.
- No challenge.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.050
- Challenge.
- Peremptory challenge.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.803
9 mm, more of a man's kind of gun.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.555
- Jerry Fernandez as a juror.
- I like him a lot.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.057
- We know about her.
- I don't carry a gun.

23:13.141 --> 23:15.476
- We accept.
- Let's not go down this road.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.852
Thank you, Mr. Rohr.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.021
Well, thank you all for being here.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.023
Thank you, Jim.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.776
- Mr. Docken.
- Yes, sir.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.986
- How do you do?
- Fine, thank you.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.657
How do you feel about
being a juror in this trial?

23:30.075 --> 23:33.119
- Do you feel you could be fair...
- Look at how he's hunched over...

23:33.203 --> 23:36.163
...and his fingers are interlaced.
He's trying not to be too obvious.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.999
He's definitely on our side
of the fence.

23:39.709 --> 23:43.129
It's a veneer. He's campaigning.
He wants on. Bounce him.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.798
- We're almost out of challenges.
- I don't care. Bounce him!

23:48.552 --> 23:51.679
- Peremptory challenge.
- Hold on, hear me out.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.013
Thank you, you're excused.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.182
- I wanna be heard.
- You may be excused.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.976
I wanna be heard!

23:57.894 --> 23:59.520
I wanna be heard!

23:59.604 --> 24:03.524
This is the blood of innocent children
gunned down by greedy corporations.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.986
You son of a bitch!

24:07.529 --> 24:08.863
Help him.

24:09.364 --> 24:11.740
Help this man. Help this man.
Get him out of here.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.911
This is not a show in here.
Get him out.

24:15.996 --> 24:19.039
The nation's trying to kill itself.
You wanna give it the weapons.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.878
Son of a bitch! Let me go!
Let me go!

24:24.129 --> 24:26.922
Let me go! Bastards!

24:34.806 --> 24:36.474
Guess that's lunch.

24:37.976 --> 24:42.229
Somebody add "class clown"
to Mr. Easter's ever-expanding resume.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.774
Court's adjourned. Voir dire will
resume tomorrow, 9 a.m.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.943
Attorneys, both of you,
in my chambers, now.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.487
Good call.

24:58.246 --> 25:01.290
There are some things, however,
that seem to live eternal.

25:01.374 --> 25:04.293
That's a tendency to always
come back asking for more.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.463
A total of 12 million more.

25:07.547 --> 25:11.967
Now, each of our gun companies has
already ponied up $4 million...

25:12.052 --> 25:15.095
...into this Sportsman's Legacy Fund.

25:15.555 --> 25:19.350
Now that may not seem like a hell
of a lot of money where you come from...

25:19.851 --> 25:23.521
...but we think $20 million ought
to be enough to secure a jury...

25:23.605 --> 25:27.525
...in the People's Republic of Berkeley,
let alone here.

25:30.445 --> 25:31.779
How about 30,000?

25:32.697 --> 25:34.490
Thirty thousand, what are
you talking about?

25:35.659 --> 25:37.701
It's an interesting amount to reflect on.

25:38.578 --> 25:41.288
The number of gun deaths every year.

25:42.165 --> 25:44.708
The number of men, women
and children disabled...

25:44.793 --> 25:48.003
...by your gentlemen's products,
last year alone:

25:48.421 --> 25:49.838
"One hundred thousand. "

25:50.674 --> 25:53.634
Or we could focus...

25:55.095 --> 25:56.679
...on the number one.

25:58.515 --> 26:01.725
Because one is all they want.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.852
One win. One precedent.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.563
Once they get that...

26:05.647 --> 26:08.732
...they're gonna be traveling around
filing civil actions...

26:08.817 --> 26:12.486
...and siphoning away
at that $2 billion...

26:13.029 --> 26:17.658
...that you gentlemen sell in firearms
and ammo every fiscal year.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.286
Two billion dollars!

26:21.246 --> 26:23.372
Where I come from,
that's a lot of money.

26:24.332 --> 26:26.500
What I'm asking for is a pittance...

26:26.835 --> 26:29.420
...compared to what
a negative verdict will cost.

26:29.754 --> 26:34.216
Our share price is down 25 percent
just on word of this trial.

26:34.301 --> 26:39.930
- I'm down almost 30.
- I'll kick in an extra 1.5, but no mas.

26:42.017 --> 26:45.311
One-point-five each, that's 7.5 total.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.230
- I'll take it.
- You have any additional plans...

26:48.315 --> 26:50.107
- ... for this pittance?
- I do.

26:50.650 --> 26:53.402
- Lonnie Shaver. Manager here?
- All day.

26:53.486 --> 26:54.945
- Ernie Strode.
- I'm gonna put you...

26:55.030 --> 26:57.531
- ... in the grocery business.
- Grocery business?

26:57.616 --> 26:59.783
We're acquiring your store.

26:59.868 --> 27:03.203
Meeting the managers to discuss
their future in the organization.

27:03.288 --> 27:06.957
- He hasn't been promoted in five years.
- Not all will be transitioned.

27:07.042 --> 27:10.461
We've ID'd you as a candidate
for the Super House program.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.755
- How soon can we fly you up?
- Mr. Shaver...

27:12.839 --> 27:16.050
...in subtle and unspoken ways
can be made to appreciate...

27:16.176 --> 27:18.969
...the terms of advancement
in the Hammond Foods empire.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.806
- I don't like the looks of this one.
- Ex-Marine drill instructor.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.976
These people are looking for a leader.
They'll follow Herrera.

27:26.061 --> 27:29.355
- If they elect someone else?
- Whoever they vote for...

27:29.439 --> 27:32.232
...will be following me.
Just like in Cincinnati...

27:32.317 --> 27:33.901
...and Oakland and Pittsburgh.

27:34.319 --> 27:39.740
Gentlemen, trials are too important
to be left up to juries.

27:43.953 --> 27:46.872
God save this state
and this honorable court.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.500
Good morning.
You may take your seats.

27:49.584 --> 27:51.919
- Who's next?
- Herman Grimes.

27:53.088 --> 27:56.256
- Is Herman Grimes in the court?
- Mr. Grimes isn't on my list.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.263
There's a swinging door ahead
of you, honey.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.765
You got it?

28:05.350 --> 28:08.977
Forty-five degrees to your left,
then 20 degrees to your right.

28:09.270 --> 28:11.689
Hold on a minute there, Mr. Grimes.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.607
There's no need
for you to have come.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.651
You're excused for disability.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.653
What if I do not wish to be excused, sir?

28:18.113 --> 28:21.532
Well, I've never known a blind man
to serve on a jury.

28:21.616 --> 28:25.536
And I must say, I can't recall any
case or law or statute that would permit...

28:25.620 --> 28:28.122
- ... or prevent...
- State v. Jack.

28:28.206 --> 28:33.127
The Supreme Court has held that it is
a violation of constitutional due process...

28:33.211 --> 28:34.878
...to just automatically dismiss...

28:34.963 --> 28:36.797
- ... the blind from jury service.
- He's right.

28:37.340 --> 28:40.759
- Mr. Grimes, that's very impressive.
- Why are you smiling, sir?

28:43.471 --> 28:46.890
Mr. Rohr, Mr. Cable,
any objections to Mr. Grimes serving?

28:47.142 --> 28:50.644
The plaintiffs would welcome Mr. Grimes
to ourjury, Your Honor.

28:51.312 --> 28:53.147
- Ourjury.
- Mr. Cable?

28:53.231 --> 28:55.649
- As would we on the defense.
- Who's next?

28:56.067 --> 28:58.777
- Nicholas Easter.
- Mr. Easter.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.990
- Mr. Rohr.
- Your Honor.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.118
- Good morning, Mr. Easter.
- Good morning.

29:06.202 --> 29:09.663
Says here you work in an electronics store.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.748
Yes, sir, that's correct.

29:10.832 --> 29:14.585
How would you feel if a gun was
behind the counter in case of a robbery?

29:14.669 --> 29:17.129
- We're in the mall, sir.
- But I think you'd agree...

29:17.213 --> 29:20.257
...robberies take place in malls.
Do they not?

29:20.341 --> 29:24.261
We're in the Esplanade Mall, which
is across from the sheriff's office.

29:24.345 --> 29:26.263
Yes, I'm familiar where it is.

29:26.514 --> 29:30.058
You'd have to be on crack to rob us.
I guess that's my point.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.061
I see. Well, tell me...

29:33.146 --> 29:36.607
That's the second time you've looked
at your watch. We keeping you?

29:36.691 --> 29:38.692
No, Your Honor, I wouldn't
presume to waste your time.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.321
If you knew my situation,
you might excuse me...

29:42.405 --> 29:44.281
Your situation, Mr. Easter?

29:44.532 --> 29:45.824
Yes, Your Honor.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.662
- It's the Madden Challenge.
- The Madden what?

29:50.747 --> 29:53.248
You know Madden Football?
It's a video game.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.626
You'd be surprised at how
many people play.

29:56.002 --> 30:00.130
Every year they choose the best 15 players
from across the country...

30:00.215 --> 30:03.008
...to compete in a tournament against
NFL players and celebrities...

30:03.092 --> 30:05.135
- I'm not following you.
- It's like this.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.387
The prize is $100,000.

30:08.181 --> 30:11.141
I can't afford to pass up the opportunity
to make that cash...

30:11.226 --> 30:16.063
- I'd like you to learn civic responsibility.
- It's something I've been doing a long...

30:16.147 --> 30:20.067
The jury system originated because for
thousands of years before that...

30:20.151 --> 30:22.110
...a judge had the power to hang...

30:22.195 --> 30:26.073
...for example, any young man
he simply did not like.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.617
Yes, Your Honor.

30:28.785 --> 30:32.496
- Any objections, Mr. Rohr?
- I have no objection, whatsoever.

30:32.580 --> 30:33.956
- Mr. Cable?
- What do I do?

30:34.040 --> 30:35.332
Any time, counselor.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.335
Harkin sandbagged us.
Go ahead and take him. Take him.

30:40.129 --> 30:42.923
- No objections, Your Honor.
- Enter Mr. Easter as a juror.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.925
Freeze that, right there. Freeze it.

31:06.614 --> 31:09.575
Thirty years in the trenches
have taught me this.

31:09.951 --> 31:13.328
There's always a loose end.
Everybody has a secret...

31:13.955 --> 31:16.498
...they don't want you to find.
Find it.

31:17.542 --> 31:21.128
First group, Monroe: Rikki Coleman,
Sylvia DeShazo, Vanessa Lembeck.

31:21.212 --> 31:25.799
Mr. Klein: Herman Grimes,
Millie Dupree, Eddie Weese.

31:26.676 --> 31:30.846
Mr. Garson: Loreen Duke, Lonnie Shaver,
Frank Herrera.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.764
Mr. Lamb, the three alternates:

31:32.849 --> 31:37.644
Lydia Deets, yoga teacher. Phillip
Savelle, shrimp fisherman. Henry Wu.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.815
Find out everything we don't know. Doyle,
you know this city better than anyone.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.110
You take Jerry Fernandez, Stella Hullic,
Nicholas Easter.

31:45.194 --> 31:47.237
These are your babies, people.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.239
This is what you live for.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.361
Think you got the wrong apartment.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.867
What are you gonna do, call the cops?

32:42.543 --> 32:45.879
- You weren't there today.
- I couldn't, I was too nervous.

32:46.547 --> 32:47.631
What are you gonna do,
hit me in the head...

32:47.715 --> 32:50.384
...with my George Foster big stick?

32:51.886 --> 32:53.553
What are you nervous about, huh?

32:54.347 --> 32:58.266
You are not juror number nine
in the biggest case of the year.

32:58.351 --> 33:01.478
You're kidding. You're kidding me.
You're kidding me.

33:01.562 --> 33:03.647
No, I'm not kidding you.

33:04.565 --> 33:05.899
How'd you do it?

33:07.318 --> 33:09.903
- How'd you do it?
- The Madden Challenge.

33:10.571 --> 33:13.740
It was a thing of beauty.
The judge even threatened to hang me.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.453
- Juror number nine.
- Juror number nine.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.124
What do you have for me?

33:28.256 --> 33:30.132
I love St. Catherine.

34:13.842 --> 34:17.344
- How do I look?
- Handsome.

34:18.514 --> 34:22.391
- Do I look honest and trustworthy?
- To an innocent eye.

34:22.476 --> 34:26.313
- Enough to survive 10 to 15 in the pen?
- Don't say that. It's bad luck.

34:26.856 --> 34:27.981
Luck.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.902
Won't see each other for a while.
They'll be watching us.

34:31.985 --> 34:36.822
- You have to come back to bed, now.
- We're just gonna have to be more careful.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.164
How much do you think it's worth?

34:44.248 --> 34:46.541
Ten, fifteen million, maybe more.

34:47.085 --> 34:51.295
- Look, that's enough. Come back to bed.
- We only need eight of them for a verdict.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.632
Everybody's got a button.
We just gotta find out where and push.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.342
You have them.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.429
We don't have anything yet.

35:26.624 --> 35:27.749
...Celeste Wood.

35:27.834 --> 35:31.294
You'll recall, two years ago,
Wood's stockbroker husband, Jacob...

35:31.379 --> 35:35.215
...was gunned down in a mass slaying
inside the firm where he worked.

35:35.299 --> 35:40.220
...two years ago by a failed day trader,
who later turned the gun on himself.

35:40.304 --> 35:45.517
Never before has a jury found
the gun industry liable for murder.

35:45.935 --> 35:48.061
You might remember,
the former mayor...

35:48.146 --> 35:50.605
...after her husband was gunned down.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.692
The man leading this,
famed attorney Wendall Rohr.

35:54.402 --> 35:58.071
- Do you feel that this lawsuit is frivolous?
- Well, it's capricious.

35:58.156 --> 36:02.325
I find it's unfortunate that Mr. Rohr has
chosen to use Ms. Wood and the courts...

36:02.410 --> 36:05.245
- ... as vehicles for civic reform.
- Mr. Rohr, how do you expect to win this?

36:06.706 --> 36:09.624
Reckless, profit-hungry gun companies
like Vicksburg...

36:09.709 --> 36:13.503
...have been getting away with murder
for too long. And we have...

36:20.761 --> 36:23.680
- Lonnie Shaver.
- Hi, I'm Sylvia DeShazo.

36:23.764 --> 36:27.100
The room is 30 feet long
by 18 feet wide.

36:29.812 --> 36:32.522
- I'm losing a lot of money on jury duty.
- Oh, really?

36:32.607 --> 36:34.357
- Sixteen dollars a day.
- What?

36:34.442 --> 36:35.859
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen?

36:35.943 --> 36:40.572
- Yeah.
- No way. $16 a day? What's this, 1892?

36:40.656 --> 36:43.533
You're not supposed to do it for the pay,
but for civic duty.

36:43.618 --> 36:47.162
- Nice to meet you. Frank Herrera.
- Henry Wu. I became a citizen last year.

36:47.747 --> 36:50.332
He deserves it,
he's the president of the free world.

36:50.833 --> 36:54.878
Coffee and doughnuts over there.
Now, these muffins I made myself.

36:54.962 --> 36:56.296
A treat for the first day.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.759
These look like they are a treat.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.724
Okay. Morning.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.895
Well, everyone's here?
All accounted for?

37:12.438 --> 37:14.731
Good. I think we should elect
a jury foreman...

37:14.815 --> 37:17.943
- ... like Judge Harkin instructed us.
- Who would that be, Mr. Man?

37:18.736 --> 37:22.155
Well, if no one else feels strongly,
I'd throw my hat in the ring.

37:22.740 --> 37:23.865
Excuse me.

37:24.825 --> 37:27.327
- Mr...?
- Herrera. Frank Herrera.

37:27.411 --> 37:32.457
Mr. Herrera. Of all of us, what makes you
think you're the best person for the job?

37:32.917 --> 37:36.044
- Well, Miss...?
- Mrs. Loreen Duke.

37:36.128 --> 37:39.756
Mrs. Duke. I was a master sergeant
in the Marine Corps.

37:39.840 --> 37:43.093
I served my country in Panama,
Grenada, Beirut, you name it.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.928
- I can run a six-minute mile.
- Young lady.

37:45.012 --> 37:48.098
If nobody minds,
I'd also like to be considered.

37:48.182 --> 37:53.061
I might not have served in Grenada,
but I'm the mother of two small children.

37:53.145 --> 37:56.439
In that case, y'all ought to consider me.
Hell, I got three kids.

37:56.524 --> 37:59.276
Ladies and gentlemen,
with all due respect...

37:59.360 --> 38:01.987
...I think I know who would make
an excellent foreman.

38:02.071 --> 38:05.699
- And who might that be, Mr...?
- Easter. Nicholas Easter, sir.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.828
I was watching people very closely
during the jury selection...

38:09.912 --> 38:13.206
...and only this man...
I don't know your name, sir.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.625
- Herman Grimes.
- Only Mr. Grimes...

38:15.710 --> 38:17.127
No, just Herman.

38:17.211 --> 38:20.964
Only Herman had the guts to stand up
to the judge and seems to know...

38:21.048 --> 38:23.591
...a little something about the law.
So in my book...

38:23.676 --> 38:27.262
- ... it'd be good for him to represent us.
- But...

38:27.638 --> 38:31.141
- But he's blind...
- He's blind. So what? So is justice, right?

38:31.225 --> 38:33.977
- That's right, brother.
- What do you think? Up to it?

38:34.061 --> 38:35.437
Of course I am.

38:35.771 --> 38:37.397
All in favor of Herman?

38:46.866 --> 38:50.368
- Did I get any votes?
- Hey, it's unanimous. You're in.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.246
All right, listen up.

38:53.789 --> 38:56.333
Court's in session.
Lunch is set for 1:00.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.336
We order up from Verti's Marte.
Please, fill out a menu.

38:59.628 --> 39:02.255
- Thank you.
- Make sure you circle what you want.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.342
Don't make it too expensive.
Thank you.

39:05.426 --> 39:08.178
I had this last week.
It's really good. Thank you.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.889
- They don't have sandwiches.
- Nothing on that menu.

39:10.973 --> 39:12.849
All right, all right.

39:17.730 --> 39:22.150
October, two years ago,
at 8:45 a.m. on a Monday morning...

39:22.860 --> 39:26.613
...a man named Kevin Peltier casually
walks into the brokerage house...

39:26.697 --> 39:29.324
...from which he was fired
the previous Friday morning.

39:29.408 --> 39:32.869
He walks into the elevator,
he loads a 36-round magazine...

39:32.953 --> 39:37.374
...into his Performa 990 semiautomatic,
and when he reaches the third floor...

39:37.458 --> 39:42.253
...opens fire on his former coworkers,
killing 11 and critically wounding five...

39:42.338 --> 39:44.714
...before turning the gun on himself.

39:45.758 --> 39:48.551
They never had a chance.
This was less than two minutes.

39:48.844 --> 39:51.679
They couldn't stop him.
Eleven lives ended.

39:52.598 --> 39:54.724
That's all you jurors minus one.

39:55.226 --> 39:59.437
And among them was Jacob Wood,
the husband of my client, Celeste Wood...

39:59.522 --> 40:03.108
...and the father of their son Henry,
6 years old.

40:04.318 --> 40:08.822
Now, I don't know about you, but I'm angry
at the tragic and senseless loss of life.

40:09.156 --> 40:13.034
Why does the Vicksburg Firearms
Company make it so easy...

40:13.369 --> 40:15.912
...to buy these guns
on the underground market?

40:15.996 --> 40:19.666
Because they care more about making
money than they do about your life...

40:19.750 --> 40:24.045
...or my life or the life
of that woman's husband.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.384
A very courageous former executive
of Vicksburg Firearms...

40:29.468 --> 40:35.098
...is gonna testify
that this Performa 990 semiautomatic...

40:35.182 --> 40:38.435
...was manufactured for,
principally, criminals...

40:39.061 --> 40:42.230
...and all those others poised
for violence.

40:43.357 --> 40:45.150
- One...
- Excuse me.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.444
Would you give these to Mr. Rohr
and Mr. Cable?

40:47.528 --> 40:50.488
...into a very efficient mass murderer.

40:56.245 --> 40:59.873
Yes, it was Mr. Peltier that squeezed
the trigger that awful morning.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.500
But it was the Vicksburg
Firearms Company...

41:02.585 --> 41:05.462
...through a deliberate,
negligent distribution policy...

41:05.546 --> 41:10.258
...that put that assault-type weapon
into the hands of Mr. Peltier.

41:10.759 --> 41:13.887
As such, they were complicit
in those murders.

41:14.847 --> 41:18.558
This I'll prove to you during the course
of the trial. Thank you very much.

41:18.934 --> 41:20.351
Your Honor.

41:24.565 --> 41:25.899
Mr. Cable.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.110
Thank you, Your Honor.

41:29.695 --> 41:31.946
- I think that went very well.
- We'll be fine.

41:32.573 --> 41:34.407
That was quite provocative.

41:35.409 --> 41:38.328
I wanna tell you two things
about guns today.

41:38.746 --> 41:39.954
I don't think either will be news.

41:40.789 --> 41:43.249
First: Guns are dangerous.

41:43.792 --> 41:46.085
They're guns.
This is their function.

41:46.420 --> 41:49.088
I wanna tell you,
no one is more aware of that

41:49.173 --> 41:51.299
or takes more responsibility for it...

41:55.888 --> 41:57.347
...since before the Civil War.

41:57.556 --> 42:02.894
The automobile industry works every day
to ensure their cars are safe.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.938
Why? Because they drive them.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.732
The people at Vicksburg work every day

42:07.816 --> 42:10.443
to keep the guns
out of the hands of criminals.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.987
Why? Because they have families
with children...

42:13.072 --> 42:17.659
- Did you see who handed this to you?
- Well, it was a woman. She had blond hair.

42:17.743 --> 42:20.828
She had pretty blond hair,
like that woman on television.

42:21.455 --> 42:23.706
We didn't catch her
on any of the CCTVs.

42:24.083 --> 42:27.544
Doesn't matter. I'm sure she was wigged.
I doubt you'll find any...

42:27.628 --> 42:30.380
...but spray this for prints.
Anything turns up...

42:30.464 --> 42:32.757
I'll process it through the database.

42:33.592 --> 42:35.426
We are not here to legislate.

42:35.511 --> 42:37.929
Mr. Cable is winding up.

42:38.013 --> 42:40.056
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

42:40.766 --> 42:44.435
...amidst the finger-pointing,
Mr. Rohr did say one true thing.

42:45.771 --> 42:48.398
This case is about money.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.984
Hi, I'm calling from the courthouse.

42:51.235 --> 42:55.321
It looks like Judge Harkin
won't be breaking till after 2.

42:56.156 --> 42:59.033
Would you mind holding his jury's
lunch order till then?

42:59.326 --> 43:00.660
Thank you.

43:09.169 --> 43:11.004
I'm also a vegetarian.

43:11.880 --> 43:16.759
What do you think about her?
I hear she teaches a class at Tulane.

43:16.844 --> 43:18.678
- Yeah?
- Wouldn't mind taking that class.

43:18.762 --> 43:21.764
- What subject?
- Well, she's a tall glass of iced tea.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.684
A little too much lemon,
a little too much ice.

43:27.354 --> 43:31.649
I'm sorry, but would you mind not doing
that in here? I'm predisposed to asthma.

43:31.942 --> 43:34.569
I'll open a window.
It ain't gonna bother you.

43:34.653 --> 43:37.947
Actually, I mind too.
Sorry, secondhand smoke.

43:38.032 --> 43:40.325
I don't wanna smoke
your cigarettes either.

43:40.409 --> 43:44.037
I can't smoke. I can't leave the room.
What is this, California?

43:44.121 --> 43:48.499
- It is against the rules.
- Be quiet. You just an alternate.

43:48.584 --> 43:50.668
What does that have to do
with anything?

43:52.379 --> 43:55.381
Come on, come on.
We're gonna be here for a while together.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.884
- So why are you bothering me?
- Let him smoke.

44:01.680 --> 44:04.349
I think we're all just hungry.
And where's our lunch...

44:04.433 --> 44:06.434
...they promised us?
It's 1:30.

44:06.518 --> 44:10.188
That's why I wanna smoke, I'm starving.
Tamp down my appetite.

44:10.272 --> 44:13.900
- Herman, want me to see what's going on?
- Good idea, Nick.

44:23.661 --> 44:27.330
...look over there and sees a cow.
He sees a golf ball in the cow's ass.

44:27.414 --> 44:31.125
And he says, "Excuse me, ma'am,"
he raises that cow's tail and says:

44:31.210 --> 44:34.545
"Does this look like yours?"
And she hit him with a four iron!

44:35.214 --> 44:38.966
Excuse me, judge.
There's someone to see you.

44:39.051 --> 44:40.343
All right.

44:40.427 --> 44:41.761
Excuse me, gentlemen.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.851
- You are...?
- Nick Easter, juror nine.

44:48.936 --> 44:54.023
Yes. What are you doing outside of the jury
room, Mr. Easter? And where is Lou Dell?

44:54.108 --> 44:56.818
- She's chatting in the hallway, sir.
- Mr. Easter...

44:56.902 --> 44:59.737
...I'd advise you to return
and finish your lunch.

44:59.822 --> 45:03.491
That's the problem, sir. I think
somebody forgot to order our lunch.

45:03.575 --> 45:05.868
- The jury has no lunch?
- That's why I'm here.

45:06.286 --> 45:09.747
Everybody knows you like to keep
a tight schedule on your bench.

45:09.832 --> 45:13.918
If we're gonna be back in less than 45
minutes, to be honest, we're hungry.

45:14.002 --> 45:16.254
Well, what exactly
would you like me to do?

45:17.131 --> 45:20.174
Lonnie, can you pass me some
garlic bread? Got any there?

45:20.259 --> 45:23.302
Oh, absolutely, man.
This stuff is delicious.

45:31.979 --> 45:35.189
I'm not sure, but I believe
I'm buying lunch for the jury.

45:48.871 --> 45:50.872
Look, jury's right there.

45:58.130 --> 46:01.090
In 35 years, that is the most absurd thing
I've ever seen.

46:01.175 --> 46:03.843
- You have mustard on your tie.
- I did it on purpose.

46:04.344 --> 46:08.306
First day of the trial, the judge is having
lunch with the jury. What's that about?

46:09.349 --> 46:11.225
- Look at that.
- What?

46:24.448 --> 46:25.615
Let's go.

46:25.908 --> 46:27.784
Hey, hey, hey! To Nick!

46:27.868 --> 46:29.160
- To Nick!
- Nick!

46:29.244 --> 46:32.121
- This is horseshit.
- It wasn't me!

46:32.206 --> 46:33.873
It was Judge Harkin.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.542
Judge Harkin!

46:37.961 --> 46:40.379
Okay. That's enough.
Thank you very much. All right.

46:46.011 --> 46:48.638
- Here's the deposition you needed.
- Thank you.

46:59.066 --> 47:00.608
Are we gonna talk about this?

47:01.652 --> 47:04.028
I can't believe you had the nerve
to bring that here.

47:04.112 --> 47:08.032
- I think we ought to discuss it.
- Why don't you just give it to the judge?

47:09.535 --> 47:11.369
- They'd throw the case out.
- Let me explain something.

47:11.453 --> 47:14.288
That's a defense tactic, okay?
All it's meant to do...

47:14.373 --> 47:17.542
...is throw our focus off
so that we can move toward a mistrial.

47:17.626 --> 47:19.919
I'd like it out of the office.
Give it to me.

47:21.421 --> 47:24.757
Barry, after you shred it,
burn it, okay?

47:25.759 --> 47:28.678
- You know how many of those I get?
- What if it's for real?

47:29.304 --> 47:31.931
- No, it's not for real.
- What if it is?

47:32.099 --> 47:35.810
Well, if it's for real,
then this isn't a trial, is it?

47:35.978 --> 47:39.063
Then this is an auction,
and I might as well get on the phone...

47:39.147 --> 47:43.025
...and call up all those anti-gun activist
friends and tell them:

47:43.110 --> 47:47.363
"We're just gonna put on a telethon,
and we will buy this verdict. "

47:49.950 --> 47:52.451
Because they're not gonna think of that,
are they?

47:56.790 --> 47:59.250
Somebody wanna get that?
Got any other suggestions?

47:59.334 --> 48:04.046
Look at it. Syntax, handwriting, word
choice. Clearly, a woman did the note.

48:04.339 --> 48:07.425
- Someone's working the inside. A juror.
- Miss Monroe.

48:07.634 --> 48:10.553
I think seven hours spent on this
is sufficient. We agree?

48:10.637 --> 48:13.472
Mr. Fitch, I got a call for you,
line seven.

48:16.143 --> 48:18.644
- Yes?
- Hello, Rankin.

48:19.187 --> 48:23.316
I'm the agent handling the property
you were notified about earlier today.

48:23.442 --> 48:26.777
- I'd like to know who I'm speaking with.
- You can call me Marlee.

48:27.404 --> 48:29.405
Pay phone, 15 miles away.

48:29.489 --> 48:30.948
You can call me Marlee.

48:31.033 --> 48:34.577
- Where are we going with this, Marlee?
- All the way to the verdict.

48:34.661 --> 48:36.162
The fact is, the jury's mine.

48:36.705 --> 48:38.039
I can push it either way...

48:38.123 --> 48:40.166
- ... for a price.
- Sounds good.

48:40.667 --> 48:42.960
So good, in fact,
I don't believe you can do it.

48:43.045 --> 48:44.712
You're old enough to remember a time

48:44.796 --> 48:46.589
when people delivered
what they promised.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.215
I'm one of those people.

48:48.300 --> 48:51.761
I'm also old enough to remember
Watergate, Abscam, Linda Tripp...

48:51.845 --> 48:55.932
...and other times people got entrapped
for engaging in conversations like this.

48:56.016 --> 48:58.434
And you'd do very good
to remember that.

48:58.518 --> 49:01.604
- There are consequences.
- Well, let me worry about those.

49:01.688 --> 49:04.649
For now, I just hope you're feeling
patriotic.

49:05.275 --> 49:07.318
- You hope I'm feeling...?
- Patriotic?

49:09.529 --> 49:11.864
- Morning, Nick.
- Morning, Lou.

49:13.700 --> 49:15.868
- Good morning, Vanessa.
- Morning.

49:15.953 --> 49:16.994
- Nick.
- Hey, guys.

49:17.079 --> 49:20.790
- How you doing, man?
- Okay. Thank you.

49:21.708 --> 49:23.501
- Hey, Lonnie.
- Hey, man.

49:24.086 --> 49:25.378
Morning, Frank.

49:28.548 --> 49:30.299
Frank, you were in Panama
and Grenada, right?

49:31.593 --> 49:35.054
- And Beirut.
- That really must have been something.

49:35.722 --> 49:39.767
Yeah. Pulling the bodies of friends
out of rubble. It was really something.

49:39.851 --> 49:41.435
No, you don't understand.

49:41.520 --> 49:44.397
I had a friend who was in Desert Storm,
in the Corps too.

49:44.481 --> 49:47.316
- What division?
- The 1-4 out of Pendleton.

49:47.401 --> 49:50.778
Yeah, well, that was mostly air power.
Not much real action.

49:53.865 --> 49:55.950
Actually, there was, Frank.

49:57.536 --> 49:59.578
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

50:00.330 --> 50:01.330
My friend's name was Donny Rabbs,

50:01.415 --> 50:03.791
and he was shot down
in a Kuwaiti oil field.

50:05.127 --> 50:08.546
- He was killed 12 years ago today.
- Sorry to hear that.

50:08.839 --> 50:13.009
Sorry, it's a strange day. I figure if I don't
remember him today, nobody else will.

50:13.093 --> 50:15.594
That's the way people are.
Short memories.

50:15.679 --> 50:18.848
That's terrible,
but we don't always know God's plan.

50:20.392 --> 50:22.935
Listen, I don't know
if it would be inappropriate...

50:23.812 --> 50:27.023
...but do you think we could
do something today to remember him?

50:27.733 --> 50:30.776
- We could say the Lord's Prayer.
- I can't ask people to pray.

50:31.111 --> 50:33.529
- "God Bless America"?
- I couldn't ask people to sing.

50:33.613 --> 50:36.449
- I don't sing.
- I don't sing, okay?

50:38.368 --> 50:40.202
You know what?
I have an idea.

50:40.287 --> 50:42.621
Good morning.
You may take your seats, please.

50:48.920 --> 50:53.174
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

50:53.258 --> 50:55.676
...of the United States ofAmerica...

50:56.553 --> 51:00.723
...and to the republic
for which it stands...

51:00.807 --> 51:04.143
...one nation under God...

51:04.227 --> 51:06.937
...indivisible, with liberty...

51:07.022 --> 51:09.523
...and justice for all.

51:10.400 --> 51:13.069
I don't know about you,
but I'm feeling pretty patriotic.

51:13.153 --> 51:15.529
Thank you, please take your seats.

51:15.822 --> 51:17.281
Jesus.

51:30.587 --> 51:31.837
Pull!

51:40.097 --> 51:41.555
You wanted to see me?

51:42.349 --> 51:45.017
Mr. Cable called me last night
in a bit of a panic.

51:46.186 --> 51:49.647
Now, he's concerned that someone's
trying to monkey with ourjury.

51:50.524 --> 51:53.025
As am I.
As are my associates.

51:54.402 --> 51:56.695
- Who is it?
- It's a parlor game.

51:57.531 --> 52:00.366
Just because somebody can influence
where a jury has lunch...

52:00.450 --> 52:02.409
...doesn't mean they can hand us
the verdict.

52:02.494 --> 52:05.371
Well, this is where I get
a little confused.

52:05.455 --> 52:07.206
Because I was under the impression

52:07.290 --> 52:09.917
that we had already
purchased ourselves a verdict.

52:14.673 --> 52:16.715
You know what I love best
about this gun?

52:17.592 --> 52:22.138
It's over 70 years old,
just as reliable as the day it was made.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.267
Mr. Fitch!

52:28.061 --> 52:30.396
You find out who it is, will you?

52:33.483 --> 52:34.900
Pull!

52:34.985 --> 52:37.778
...one nation, under God...

52:37.863 --> 52:40.823
At some point, everyone on the jury
acknowledges Herrera.

52:40.907 --> 52:43.659
- It's like they're doing it for him.
- It's not him.

52:43.743 --> 52:46.912
Right here at the end, Loreen Duke,
juror number 10...

52:46.997 --> 52:50.249
Right there! Freeze there.
But tighten in on her left hand.

52:52.460 --> 52:53.961
Right there.

52:56.131 --> 52:57.506
Isn't that sweet?

52:57.591 --> 53:00.551
Nicholas Easter, our song and dance man,
has an agenda.

53:01.261 --> 53:04.346
Mr. Lamb, how did this confidence man
crash my jury pool?

53:05.182 --> 53:09.268
- I don't know. I'd need some time, sir.
- Now. I'm asking for an educated guess.

53:10.187 --> 53:14.148
Maybe he just did it. I mean,
who wants jury duty? Nobody, right?

53:14.232 --> 53:16.317
It's like going to the dentist.
It's worse.

53:16.401 --> 53:19.528
It's a municipal database
nobody would want to hack into.

53:19.613 --> 53:22.406
Security is weak.
He could put his name on the list...

53:22.490 --> 53:24.158
I got it, Mr. Lamb, thank you.

53:24.242 --> 53:26.118
- Mr. Doyle.
- I'm on it.

53:26.203 --> 53:30.581
Your Honor. Good afternoon, Mr. Murphy.
You own and operate Excalibur Guns.

53:30.665 --> 53:33.876
- Yes, sir, I do.
- Isn't Excalibur Guns a retail outlet store...

53:33.960 --> 53:36.754
- ... for Vicksburg Firearms?
- Yes, sir.

53:36.838 --> 53:38.297
Would you tell us about
your arrangement...

53:38.381 --> 53:45.304
...with Michael Kincaid, who illegally sold
this Performa 990 semiautomatic...

53:45.388 --> 53:48.390
...to Kevin Peltier smack-dab
out of the trunk of his car.

53:48.475 --> 53:50.059
- My arrangement?
- Yes, sir.

53:50.936 --> 53:55.064
Well, Mikey... Mr. Kincaid
bought guns from my store.

53:55.148 --> 53:57.566
At a rate of more than 25 a month.

53:57.651 --> 54:01.779
Didn't you ever wonder who your friend
Mikey was selling these guns to?

54:01.863 --> 54:04.198
- That's none of my business.
- It's not your problem.

54:04.282 --> 54:08.160
- Hold on, I didn't say that.
- Objection. Counsel is testifying.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.162
Sustained. Mr. Rohr.

54:12.832 --> 54:14.500
Thanks a lot.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.424
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

54:27.430 --> 54:30.099
...your friend, Mikey Kincaid,
28 guns in December.

54:30.183 --> 54:35.145
Did you ever wonder why one man would
buy 112 guns in a period of four months?

54:35.939 --> 54:37.856
- Collector.
- A collector, sir?

54:37.941 --> 54:42.569
A hundred and twelve weapons, and all
of them semiautomatic assault weapons.

54:42.654 --> 54:44.655
- I don't know.
- Come on, take a guess.

54:45.365 --> 54:47.491
- Christmas presents?
- That's a guess.

54:47.575 --> 54:50.619
- Objection. This is all speculation.
- Sustained.

54:50.704 --> 54:53.455
Did they send a field rep out
to investigate?

54:53.540 --> 54:54.540
No, sir.

54:54.624 --> 54:57.209
- Because they were pleased with you?
- Say again.

54:57.294 --> 55:00.254
Is it not true that Vicksburg Firearms...

55:00.338 --> 55:05.009
...instead of investigating the increasing
number of guns being sold to one man...

55:05.093 --> 55:08.554
...instead sent you and your wife
on a trip to Jamaica?

55:09.055 --> 55:11.223
- No.
- No?

55:11.683 --> 55:14.143
My wife hates Jamaica.
We switched to Cancun.

55:17.022 --> 55:20.065
- I have no further questions, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

55:20.150 --> 55:24.528
We'll adjourn. Hold cross till tomorrow.
Release the jury 45 minutes early.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.864
Oh, hi. Yeah, the landlord let me in.

56:08.948 --> 56:11.617
He said some tenants have been
having trouble with the cable.

56:11.701 --> 56:14.578
But I checked yours out, and...

56:26.966 --> 58:16.033
Hey!

58:31.257 --> 58:33.550
Looks fine.
I don't think you have anything...

58:35.595 --> 58:38.764
- What have we got, people?
- The drive's been erased twice...

58:38.848 --> 58:42.059
...but not zeroed out. He may have been
sloppier than he thought.

58:42.310 --> 58:44.520
- Give me a few moments.
- Mr. Fitch.

58:45.021 --> 58:46.772
Lamb, trace it.

58:49.943 --> 58:51.318
Fitch here.

58:52.028 --> 58:53.779
You don't play nice.

58:54.113 --> 58:57.658
- What are you talking about?
- You broke into Nick Easter's apartment.

58:58.159 --> 59:01.954
- And you freely assume it was me?
- Wouldn't you be disappointed if I didn't?

59:02.455 --> 59:05.207
I'm bumping a juror. One of yours.

59:05.959 --> 59:07.793
This time's just gonna be a pinprick.

59:08.628 --> 59:10.254
Next time, it's really gonna hurt.

59:37.448 --> 59:39.241
- Hey.
- Hello.

59:48.501 --> 59:51.503
Looks like somebody had themselves
a good time last night.

59:53.172 --> 59:54.715
I woke up on my stove.

59:55.550 --> 59:57.009
Oh, man.

59:58.761 --> 01:00:01.179
Stella, you don't got any aspirin, do you?

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:19.781
- I think I can do better than an aspirin.
- Yeah?

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.908
Little hair of the dog.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:26.788
- Can you sweeten this up for me?
- Yeah, put it under the table.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:28.749
You're an angel.

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:32.210
- Let me pour it. Let me do it!
- I'll pour it.

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:33.879
Jesus.

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:41.970
It's mine, sir.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:44.640
I didn't take you for a day drinker,
Mr. Easter.

01:00:44.932 --> 01:00:46.224
I'm usually not.

01:00:47.518 --> 01:00:50.395
You still trying to get off my jury,
is that it?

01:00:51.689 --> 01:00:54.524
Your Honor, I took an oath
to do my best, and I meant it.

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:57.152
Difficult as that is to believe...

01:00:57.236 --> 01:01:00.072
...it's even more difficult
to believe this is your liquor.

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:03.909
I might be wrong, but I don't think
that's your shade of lipstick.

01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:08.121
Miss Hullic?

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:11.708
Moving into Miss Hullic's spot
will be first alternate Lydia Deets.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:15.212
Miss Deets, could you join
the jurors in the box, please?

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:20.634
Welcome to ourjury. I trust you got the
same instructions as the rest of the jurors.

01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:25.806
Cell phone. Untraceable.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:30.018
- Marlee?
- I'd like your offer, Mr. Fitch.

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:34.648
Not over the phone.
This is not gonna take place long-distance.

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:38.026
- Want to lose anotherjuror?
- Anybody can get a juror booted.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.653
That doesn't show
you can deliver a verdict.

01:01:39.737 --> 01:01:42.864
I could get Easter canned if I wanted.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:47.077
But you won't do that. You need him
to guarantee the jury swings your way.

01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:50.455
So next time I call,
have your offer ready.

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:57.045
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:01:57.130 --> 01:02:02.134
...this girl is an amateur,
do you understand? A dilettante.

01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:05.387
And I want this nonsense ended today.

01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:08.390
I want you to find her.
I want you to contain her.

01:02:08.474 --> 01:02:10.600
Because you're losing me my jury!

01:02:13.312 --> 01:02:15.981
Now find something
on every one of them.

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:19.985
Pull their files. Review every word,
every photo, every medical record.

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:22.070
Do it!

01:02:25.658 --> 01:02:27.159
What do we have?!

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.453
Rikki Coleman's boyfriend
is Neil Pollard.

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:33.415
Mrs. Coleman broke it off with him
two months after the abortion.

01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:36.710
Mr. Coleman has racked up
three cases of domestic battery.

01:02:36.794 --> 01:02:38.670
So she didn't cry to him about it.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:43.341
Your husband looks a lot different than
your boyfriend with you at the clinic.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.177
We'll be in touch.

01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:53.769
Four months ago, Mr. Weese began filling
prescriptions for the following drugs:

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:56.730
Crixivan, Epivir and AZT.

01:02:56.814 --> 01:03:00.609
Unbeknownst to his mother,
his employer, his church and friends...

01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:02.569
...Mr. Weese is HIV-positive.

01:03:02.653 --> 01:03:04.321
Get off me.

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:06.865
That's what I'm talking about.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:10.535
Got a little present for you.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.871
- You an NBA scout?
- It'll change your life.

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:15.415
- Yeah?
- I'll be in touch.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.587
Millie Dupree,
married 18 years to Hoppy Dupree...

01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:21.713
Hey, Hoppy.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:24.716
...one of the city's more
unprincipled real-estate agents.

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:26.384
Okay. Nice meeting you.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.136
Mr. Ringwald has set the bait.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:33.308
Mr. Ringwald, if anybody can help you
walk that land deal through, it'd be me.

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:35.811
Owens and Strode are about
to close the snare.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:38.688
Is that convincing enough for you?

01:03:39.305 --> 01:03:45.801
