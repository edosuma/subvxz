WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:12.142
- Ahh...

00:12.229 --> 00:14.971
I'm just a puffy little
bunch of bubbles.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.625
Hey, Scratch!

00:22.283 --> 00:24.502
Molly, turn around, please!

00:24.589 --> 00:26.809
Oh, what's the big deal?
You don't even wear clothes.

00:26.896 --> 00:29.855
Yes, but I happen to be
emotionally naked, right now!

00:29.942 --> 00:32.293
What's so urgent that you

00:32.380 --> 00:35.252
ripped me away
from my me time?

00:35.339 --> 00:38.647
- I'm afraid, Scratch.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.649
Now, we're gettin' somewhere!

00:40.736 --> 00:42.477
- Be specific, please.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.131
I know you've said that

00:44.218 --> 00:46.307
you're really popular
in the ghost world.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.961
Yes! Yes, I am.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.486
This club is only
for popular ghosts.

00:51.573 --> 00:53.618
Not the worst of the worst.

00:56.404 --> 00:59.102
Yeah, I'm very popular.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.626
Like #1 on the list if there
was a list, but, of course,

01:01.713 --> 01:04.020
there's not, 'cause it would
hurt everyone else's feelings.

01:04.107 --> 01:07.023
I knew it. So,
you probably can't relate,

01:07.110 --> 01:09.678
but today is
the first day of school.

01:09.765 --> 01:12.594
And our family's moved a lot.
You know, like, <i>a lot,</i> a lot.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.074
So, trust me when I tell you,

01:14.161 --> 01:15.771
the first day of school
in a new town

01:15.858 --> 01:17.251
is super important
and the stakes

01:17.338 --> 01:18.817
have never been higher.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.993
Do you realize that
even one eensy-weensy

01:21.081 --> 01:22.604
embarrassing mistake

01:22.691 --> 01:24.562
could turn me into
a social outcast forever?!

01:24.649 --> 01:26.695
- You'd be ruined.
- Exactly!

01:26.782 --> 01:28.131
You'd have to leave Brighton.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.567
Probably in the dead of night!

01:29.654 --> 01:31.178
The curse would be broken

01:31.265 --> 01:32.831
and I'd be back in this house
by myself.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.660
You know, now that I'm
talking to you about it,

01:35.747 --> 01:37.706
I hear how ridiculous
all my fears sound.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.360
I don't think
they're ridiculous, at all.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.362
- I think--
- It's gonna be fine.

01:41.449 --> 01:43.190
No, it's going to be
a disaster!

01:43.277 --> 01:44.539
I love making people happy,

01:44.626 --> 01:46.280
so, I'm bound
to make tons of friends.

01:46.367 --> 01:49.370
Not on my watch! This
will be the worst first day

01:49.457 --> 01:51.198
in the history of first days!

01:51.285 --> 01:55.637
I promise, McGee, you
won't make even one friend!

01:56.725 --> 01:58.379
Aw, nice try, Scratchy,

01:58.466 --> 02:00.381
I already
re-energized my positivity.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.731
Thanks for being
a sounding-board! Bye!

02:05.908 --> 02:07.649
She bothers me.

02:11.261 --> 02:13.524
Wow,
both our kids in middle-school.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.918
They just--
They're growing up so fast.

02:16.005 --> 02:18.703
Next, it's gonna be college,
then a career, then grandkids--

02:18.790 --> 02:20.401
Oh, my gosh,
I'm gonna be a grandpa!

02:20.488 --> 02:22.272
- You do it.
- Okay, big smiles!

02:22.359 --> 02:24.100
Who's ready for
a fantastic school year

02:24.187 --> 02:26.058
with minimal trips
to the principal's office?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.756
- Me!
- Her!

02:27.843 --> 02:30.585
- All right, you two, have fun!

02:30.672 --> 02:32.369
You know I will!

02:32.456 --> 02:35.067
I guarantee you won't!

02:35.155 --> 02:37.983
As I'm sure
many of you have noticed,

02:38.070 --> 02:40.116
we have a new student
joining us.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.770
Welcome, Molly McGee!
Would you like to

02:41.857 --> 02:43.206
tell us
a little about yourself?

02:43.293 --> 02:45.948
I sure would!

02:46.035 --> 02:48.820
If you know only one thing
about me, it's that I--

02:48.907 --> 02:51.954
- Whoa-whoa!

02:52.041 --> 02:54.304
- What's she doing?

02:54.391 --> 02:58.743
Okay, we got it. Whoa!
We got it. Okay.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.093
- Whoa-whoa!

03:01.181 --> 03:04.358
Whoa-whoa!

03:04.445 --> 03:07.361
I, uh, like to dance.

03:17.806 --> 03:20.635
Brava! <i>Ahn-</i> drea Davenport,

03:20.722 --> 03:22.985
social influencer,
future disruptor,

03:23.072 --> 03:25.596
Brighton Middle School's
Official Good Will Ambassador.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.165
It's a lot of things in one,
I know.

03:29.252 --> 03:32.342
I'd be honored if you'd join me
on stage this afternoon

03:32.429 --> 03:34.344
at the
"New School Year Assembly."

03:34.431 --> 03:37.129
Wow! Thanks, that
would be incredible, <i>Ann-</i> drea!

03:39.915 --> 03:43.484
- What's this?

03:43.571 --> 03:47.227
It's actually <i>Ahn-</i> drea.

03:47.314 --> 03:50.317
- Isn't that what I said?
- No. You said <i>Ann-</i> drea.

03:50.404 --> 03:53.233
Oh! I'm so sorry!

03:53.320 --> 03:56.366
Oh, honey, it's fine.
It's your first day.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.194
- Forgive and forget.
- Wow, thank you.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.109
<i>Ahn-</i> drea, that's
really nice of you.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.938
Oh, crud, is it <i>Ann-</i> drea?
Or, wait--

04:03.025 --> 04:07.203
What was it again? Which vowel?
Is it E? A, E, I, O--

04:07.290 --> 04:09.858
- Onn-drea? Is there an umlaut?

04:09.945 --> 04:12.469
Is it like <i>Aun-</i> drea? Or did--

04:12.556 --> 04:14.689
Maybe you should take a seat.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.995
Before you make this even worse.

04:17.082 --> 04:19.128
Ooh...

04:19.215 --> 04:21.957
Once is an innocent mistake.
But twice?!

04:22.044 --> 04:23.524
She's a monster!

04:26.135 --> 04:29.617
Psst! Hey, in the first grade,
there was a girl named Libby,

04:29.704 --> 04:33.098
She was bright-eyed and
full of promise, until one day,

04:33.185 --> 04:36.841
she called <i>Ahn-</i> drea <i>Ann-</i> drea,
and from that moment on,

04:36.928 --> 04:39.366
she was an outcast,
forever shunned

04:39.453 --> 04:41.019
from respectable society.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.325
What happened to her?

04:42.412 --> 04:44.240
She's me. I'm Libby.

04:44.327 --> 04:47.112
Don't get too close! I think
I've almost got her worn down.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.898
Lookin' good, <i>Ahn-</i> drea!

04:49.985 --> 04:53.118
Well, I think we can
safely call this day ruined.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.817
You wanna go home? I'll help
you start packing your stuff?

04:55.904 --> 04:58.080
Oh, come on, Scratch,
it's not that big of a deal.

04:58.167 --> 05:01.475
I have the whole day. I'm bound
to make at least one friend.

Come on,

05:51.655 --> 05:53.265
You got this!

05:53.353 --> 05:56.138
Gotta hand it to you, Moll,
you ruined this day

05:56.225 --> 05:58.096
way better than
anything I coulda done.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.316
I mean,
that was some primo stuff.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.797
No, no, no,
I can still turn it around.

06:02.884 --> 06:05.713
Nah. This day,
like you, is over.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.497
So, let's go home,
pack up your things,

06:07.584 --> 06:09.412
I'll call a moving van,
you can get outta here.

06:09.499 --> 06:10.935
There's still the assembly.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.807
What do you think's
gonna happen there?

06:12.894 --> 06:16.158
Some kind of miracle where
suddenly, everybody likes you?

06:16.245 --> 06:18.943
It's done, Moll. You have
no future in this school.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.119
- Or in this town!
- You're right.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.992
Today has been a disaster.
Things can't get any worse.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.559
- Yeah...
Therefore,

06:25.646 --> 06:27.387
- they can only get better!
- What?

06:27.474 --> 06:28.823
- I was wrong!
- No, you weren't.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.564
It's not all about
the first day.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.174
It's totally about
the first day.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.219
- It's about <i>every</i> day!
- No, it's not!

06:34.306 --> 06:36.047
So, I'll just keep
being who I am

06:36.134 --> 06:39.224
and eventually, one fine day,
someone will be my friend!

06:39.311 --> 06:43.011
You got inspirational--
In a bathroom.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.317
Oh, yeah. It's my superpower!
I can do it anywhere.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.493
I did it at a funeral, once.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.538
You are the most frustrating--

06:53.238 --> 06:55.023
Whoops, reflex.

06:55.110 --> 06:58.026
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!
Wake up, <i>Ann</i>-drea!

06:58.113 --> 06:59.331
- <i>Ahn-</i> drea.
- Oh, whatever!

06:59.419 --> 07:00.855
Help me get her in that cart.

07:00.942 --> 07:03.510
Ah! Disposing
of the body. Great plan!

07:03.597 --> 07:07.209
What?! No! I've got to
get her to the nurse's office!

07:07.296 --> 07:09.472
That lady has
nothin' but Band-Aids.

07:13.171 --> 07:15.913
Wait a minute-- I have no idea
where the nurse's office is.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.349
Oh! A map!

07:19.047 --> 07:20.788
- Aah!

07:30.580 --> 07:32.843
No! Ugh!

07:32.930 --> 07:35.455
Ah! What an elegant bouquet

07:35.542 --> 07:37.718
of emotional and
physical floundering.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.589
Ah, youth!

07:39.676 --> 07:42.636
I can fix this. I just
have to get <i>Ann</i>-drea--

07:42.723 --> 07:45.073
<i>-Ahn</i>-drea.
Not now!

07:45.160 --> 07:47.118
I have to get her
to the nurse's office

07:47.205 --> 07:49.251
- before anyone notices.
- Great idea!

07:49.338 --> 07:50.861
And I'm gonna
raise this curtain

07:50.948 --> 07:52.646
for no particular reason.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.956
It's Molly McGee!

07:59.043 --> 08:00.741
What's
she doing with <i>Ahn-</i> drea?

08:00.828 --> 08:02.873
It's not what it looks like!

08:02.960 --> 08:05.833
Buh-bye, Molly McGee!

08:05.920 --> 08:08.400
Seriously! Who
does she think she is?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.838
She's the worst of the worst!

08:12.143 --> 08:14.755
- The worst of the worst!

08:14.842 --> 08:17.627
- Oh, no! No, come on.

08:17.714 --> 08:20.108
What's this feeling?
I've won! You won!

08:20.195 --> 08:22.763
It's over! Molly McGee
is as good as packed and--

08:22.850 --> 08:26.114
Yet, I can't
believe I'm gonna do this.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.943
Please! When you hear the story
of what really happened--

08:29.030 --> 08:31.336
--you're gonna think I'm crazy.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.295
I'm gonna need a Plan B.

08:38.343 --> 08:39.823
Hey, hey, gang,

08:39.910 --> 08:42.522
it's me, <i>Ahn-</i> drea Davenport!

08:42.609 --> 08:44.785
Gimme that applause, already!
What do I gotta do?

08:44.872 --> 08:46.656
- Yay.

08:47.701 --> 08:48.745
Scratch?

08:50.704 --> 08:53.141
Okay,
thank you, where to start.

08:53.228 --> 08:55.317
First, I'm over the whole <i>
Ann</i>-drea, <i>Ahn</i>-drea thing.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.841
I mean, believe me
when I say life is too short!

08:57.928 --> 09:01.889
You can call me <i>Ahn-</i> drea, <i>
Ann-</i> drea, <i>Or</i>-drea,

09:01.976 --> 09:04.456
<i>Au-</i> drea, whatever!
I say, go nuts with it.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.110
Let's get creative!

09:06.197 --> 09:08.112
Now, I'd like to
bring it down a little bit,

09:08.199 --> 09:09.636
get a little serious.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.507
Because there's
a girl out there

09:11.594 --> 09:13.988
having a really rough day
and I think,

09:14.075 --> 09:17.339
in some <i>small</i> way,
that's my fault.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.471
She doesn't deserve
to be treated

09:19.559 --> 09:22.387
like the worst of the worst.
No one does!

09:22.474 --> 09:24.999
So, please, on my behalf,

09:25.086 --> 09:28.132
give a big Brighton
Middle School cheer for...

09:28.219 --> 09:30.787
- Libby!

09:30.874 --> 09:33.137
She's okay, now! I decree it!

09:33.224 --> 09:38.099
- Yes! Outcast, no more!

09:38.186 --> 09:40.362
Also, Molly McGee
isn't so bad, either.

09:40.449 --> 09:41.929
Cut her some slack,
you animals.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.543
- We love you, <i>Ann-</i> drea!

09:47.630 --> 09:49.545
<i>Ann-</i> drea! <i>Ann-</i> drea!

09:49.632 --> 09:54.332
<i>Ann-</i> drea?!
What happened, here?!

09:54.419 --> 09:56.726
- See you tomorrow, Molly!
- Have a great night!

09:56.813 --> 09:57.901
Bye!

09:57.988 --> 10:00.382
So, you were wrong.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.210
I ended the day
with a lot of friends.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.820
Ugh. Like that's a good thing?

10:03.907 --> 10:05.605
But you were also right.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.390
Because this day
would've been a huge disaster

10:08.477 --> 10:11.872
if it weren't for my very
bestest best friend ever.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.308
- Eh?
- Who, me?

10:13.395 --> 10:14.962
Oh, no-no-no,
I am not your friend.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.528
Then why'd you
save my first day?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.401
Because otherwise you
would be headed to jail,

10:19.488 --> 10:21.011
- and you'd drag me along,
- Uh-huh.

10:21.098 --> 10:23.057
and I can't get
in that kind of shape.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.929
You can't deny it, Scratch.
We're friends, my dude.

10:26.016 --> 10:29.063
More than that,
we're best friends! Besties!

10:29.150 --> 10:31.587
- No! I don't have besties!
- Oh, we're besties!

10:31.674 --> 10:33.415
- No! No!
- We're such besties!

10:33.502 --> 10:36.244
- I was saving myself for me!
- La, la, la!

10:36.331 --> 10:39.595
You love me!
Best friends, forever!
