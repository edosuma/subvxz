00:04.250 --> 00:05.740
[Calvin]
Previously on Siren.

00:05.750 --> 00:08.492
That whacked out
mermaid that I rescued,
she came back.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.240
She locked me in the hold
of the North Star.

00:10.250 --> 00:12.241
Get your ass over here
and get me out!

00:12.250 --> 00:14.070
[Ben] Uh, this is Nicole.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.287
She's been hangin' out
with Xander.

00:16.290 --> 00:17.450
[Nicole]
That's one way to put it.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.610
[screaming]

00:21.620 --> 00:23.872
You w_ere_never
gonna kill him, Xan.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.199
You couldn't.

00:25.210 --> 00:26.825
Before I was laid off,
I was trying to find

00:26.830 --> 00:29.207
this big supplier
they called The Chemist.

00:29.210 --> 00:30.529
Might have had something
to do with Donnie's homicide.

00:30.540 --> 00:32.246
I can't be sure.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.741
I got something big
to add to the story.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.911
It looks like my father,

00:36.920 --> 00:39.411
he's in bed with big oil.

00:39.420 --> 00:41.877
Great story.
Too bad we can't tell it.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.202
We're ready to fight,
together, with you.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.911
[fisherman]
What the hell is that?!

01:03.290 --> 01:05.201
All right,
go on three.

01:05.210 --> 01:06.950
One, two, three.

01:27.120 --> 01:30.374
[Ben] Everything's gonna
change around here.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.996
_ Klesco Oil _
Isn't gonna qUIt.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.490
They'll just bring
in more machines.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.661
They think that
they can break ground,

01:37.670 --> 01:39.319
take what they want,

01:39.330 --> 01:41.707
and none of us will do
a damn thing about it.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.666
But you know what?
They're wrong.

01:45.210 --> 01:47.917
We gotta show the world
what's going on here.

01:49.250 --> 01:50.615
We have to make a big move.

01:50.620 --> 01:51.700
No more talk.

01:51.710 --> 01:53.325
Time to fight.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.740
[coroner's assistant]
Fishing crew pulled in
a body off Dungeness.

02:02.750 --> 02:03.910
Okay.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.035
Caught up
with the catch.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.570
You listen. Then you help.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.411
Whatever we do,

02:13.420 --> 02:14.739
we have
to work together,

02:14.750 --> 02:15.876
as a team.

02:17.210 --> 02:18.370
[Helen]
These creatures aren't built

02:18.380 --> 02:20.245
-for the Situation Room.
-[hIsses]

02:20.250 --> 02:23.413
They must be quite exhausted
after transforming.

02:23.420 --> 02:25.240
Why don't I take them
back to my house?

02:25.250 --> 02:26.877
-Yeah.
-[Maddie] Thanks.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.279
-We could use a sitter.
-Yeah.

02:28.290 --> 02:30.076
Give us time to plan.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.708
Xander said that we could
use the North Star as a base.

02:32.710 --> 02:34.246
Okay.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.037
[Helen] Fetch your friend
from the water, please.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.576
-You are okay?
-No.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.201
Bad man kill mother.

02:53.210 --> 02:54.279
[hisses]

02:54.290 --> 02:56.030
Come with me.

02:57.420 --> 02:58.990
I take her to see Xander.

02:59.000 --> 02:59.989
They need to talk.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.036
You'd better be careful.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.416
Safe with me.

03:03.420 --> 03:05.285
Keep her under your fin.

03:11.620 --> 03:12.871
[Maddie]
This thing messed you up.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.279
It almost killed Ryn.

03:14.290 --> 03:16.497
How do we even get close
enough to do anything?

03:16.500 --> 03:20.823
Look, this is just
the first step anyway.

03:20.830 --> 03:23.492
We disable it,
they're just gonna put
another one down there.

03:25.420 --> 03:27.741
We gotta do
something big, Maddie.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.319
Push them
outta here for good.

03:36.460 --> 03:38.246
Angle of entry
and capillary damage

03:38.250 --> 03:40.457
suggest the chest wound
was inflicted with force.

03:40.460 --> 03:42.030
Some kind of spear.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.075
Big one.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.490
Homicide?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.286
Looks that way.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.451
Not to mention
he was gift-wrapped
before they tossed him over.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.536
Where we at on the I.D.?

03:51.540 --> 03:54.031
Sean Ronald McClure,
Bristol Cove.

03:54.040 --> 03:57.112
Reported lost at sea
about a month ago.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.496
Dentals match.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.491
Notify the local
sheriff's office?

04:00.500 --> 04:03.913
Nah. Crimes at sea.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.456
This one's the Feds.

04:07.460 --> 04:09.951
[high-pitched call]

04:12.500 --> 04:14.161
[Chief Judy Brennan]
Thank you.

04:18.540 --> 04:20.110
Morning, Chief.

04:20.120 --> 04:23.908
Dale. Thanks for coming in
on such short notice.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.069
Sit down.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.069
No problem.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.117
So, Glen Jenkins.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.419
Lowlife scum
by all accounts.

04:36.420 --> 04:38.615
Guy was moving
a lot of product
through the county.

04:38.620 --> 04:41.168
Gotta hand it to you,
it was a good idea

04:41.170 --> 04:43.320
to get your deputy
to re-open those files.

04:44.830 --> 04:46.957
-I'm glad the tip paid off.
-Mm-hmm.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.167
Thanks to you, we found
some of Jenkins' stash

04:51.380 --> 04:52.950
Got the feeling
it's not the only crime

04:52.960 --> 04:55.372
we link back to Jenkins
and his drugs.

04:59.790 --> 05:01.496
You did good, Sheriff.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.070
M
al
am?

05:03.080 --> 05:04.991
But the good news is
you're not crazy.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.877
According to State,
anyway.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.417
And the town council's happy
to have you back on the force.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.530
Thank you.

05:17.540 --> 05:18.666
You're welcome.

05:18.670 --> 05:20.114
Get to work.

05:22.420 --> 05:23.409
Report up to date?

05:25.420 --> 05:28.662
Terry Jackson,
and this is Evan Foster, FBI.

05:30.290 --> 05:31.951
We're looking at a homicide
committed at sea?

05:33.460 --> 05:34.529
Stabbed?

05:34.540 --> 05:36.030
His wounds are indicative

05:36.040 --> 05:37.530
of a single entry
chest trauma.

05:37.540 --> 05:39.747
Massive internal hemorrhage.

05:39.750 --> 05:42.162
His assailant had to have
been of unusual strength.

05:42.170 --> 05:43.614
What makes you say that?

05:43.620 --> 05:46.202
They drove
the weapon straight
through the sternum,

05:46.210 --> 05:49.031
broke four ribs
on its way through
the heart and left lung.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.412
Four witnesses on a boat
out of Bristol Cove

05:54.420 --> 05:57.287
testified he was caught up
in a net, went overboard.

05:58.670 --> 06:01.571
Contact the local sheriff,
have all four detained.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.826
Find out which genius
decided to give him
a burial at sea.

06:10.710 --> 06:12.246
Well... [grunts]

06:14.290 --> 06:16.667
that's everything.

06:16.670 --> 06:19.707
I'm so glad they've
asked you back to work.

06:19.710 --> 06:20.870
It must feel good.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.416
Yeah, they want me
to head on in.

06:23.670 --> 06:24.910
I best be going.

06:26.170 --> 06:27.535
I'm sorry.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.491
I didn't exactly
make things easy.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.207
We all did
our best here.

06:37.670 --> 06:40.377
I paid for, uh, first
and last months' rent here.

06:40.380 --> 06:42.701
Give you
a little cushion.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.740
I promise I'll get a job.

06:49.540 --> 06:52.498
And I'll invite you two
over for dinner soon.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.075
That'd be nice.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.160
Yeah.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.610
Goodbye...

07:03.040 --> 07:04.416
Dale.

07:04.420 --> 07:07.742
I'm rootin' for you, Susie.

07:12.750 --> 07:15.537
It connects to the ship
on this pole arm.

07:15.540 --> 07:18.168
Power source runs
alongsrde the safety tether,

07:18.170 --> 07:20.411
embedded in the body
of the cannon.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.240
So we get close enough,

07:22.250 --> 07:24.571
wait five minutes
between blasts,

07:24.580 --> 07:25.615
and cut it.

07:27.170 --> 07:28.956
Boom.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.325
No more booms.

07:30.330 --> 07:31.911
[knock on door]

07:40.790 --> 07:41.950
Hey.

07:45.620 --> 07:47.326
I need you
to come with me, Ben.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.615
Welcome back, Sheriff.

07:53.620 --> 07:54.871
[male deputy]
Hey, there he is.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.916
[female deputy]
So good to see you.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.320
Very happy to see my team.

07:59.330 --> 08:04.996
And a big thanks
to Deputy Marissa
for her leadership.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.410
Sheriff.

08:06.420 --> 08:09.571
I owe you, Deputy.
I know that.

08:09.580 --> 08:11.411
You picked a helluva day
to come back.

08:12.670 --> 08:14.035
Sean McClure's body surfaced.

08:16.290 --> 08:17.575
Where?

08:17.580 --> 08:18.990
Crew out of Dungeness
hauled it up.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.877
M.E. notified the Feds.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.536
And they think it's something
more than an accident?

08:25.830 --> 08:27.570
They want to interview
the witnesses.

08:27.580 --> 08:30.617
I sent Clarence
to pick up Ben Pownall.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.074
You collect Calvin Lee.

08:36.580 --> 08:38.241
I'll get Xander McClure.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.615
Sir.

08:41.580 --> 08:44.287
[rock music playing
in The Anchor]

08:46.580 --> 08:49.993
Hey, um, maybe just
another couple of eggs then?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.661
This is really my life.

08:51.670 --> 08:54.616
I am a gluten provider
to a grown man.

08:54.620 --> 08:56.576
Aw, baby, hey, come on.

08:57.830 --> 08:58.785
Please?

09:09.250 --> 09:11.115
[seagulls calling]

09:14.330 --> 09:15.661
Got any plans
for the weekend?

09:15.670 --> 09:17.706
No. Nothin' special.

09:17.710 --> 09:19.530
You know, drinkin'.

09:19.540 --> 09:22.327
Yeah, looks like
the party people
were already here.

09:22.330 --> 09:23.877
Yeah, I'm, uh...

09:23.880 --> 09:25.871
I'm not much one
for housekeeping, yeah.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.747
I really gotta
get my shit together.

09:30.920 --> 09:34.378
Well, luckily,
you have other talents.

09:37.460 --> 09:39.951
It was a rough night,
Nic, okay?

09:39.960 --> 09:41.166
No offense.

09:41.170 --> 09:42.159
None taken.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.996
Except I was wondering.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.740
Hmm?

09:48.750 --> 09:50.661
You seeing other people?

09:52.670 --> 09:54.535
[laughs] What?

09:54.540 --> 09:55.700
I'll just say it.

09:55.710 --> 09:57.416
I was on my way over
last night,

09:57.420 --> 10:00.537
and I didn't come in _
'cause I saw some strange chick

10:00.540 --> 10:03.247
up on your roof
acting all deranged.

10:05.710 --> 10:08.918
Yeah?
Well, uh, deranged how?

10:08.920 --> 10:11.491
She sort of shrieked at me,

10:11.500 --> 10:13.912
so I cut and ran.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.740
Couldn't help wondering
if you were...

10:17.120 --> 10:18.530
entertaining.

10:18.540 --> 10:20.531
[laughs]

10:20.540 --> 10:24.249
Babe, there are,
like, I don't know,
a million tweakers

10:24.250 --> 10:27.037
that end up hangin' out
around the docks at night.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.913
Hey, I'm not seeing
anyone else right now.

10:33.920 --> 10:34.818
Okay?

10:37.040 --> 10:38.029
Not interested, either.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.490
[knock on door]

10:40.500 --> 10:41.876
Uh, come in. Yeah--

10:41.880 --> 10:43.609
Xander?

10:47.380 --> 10:48.699
There's some tough news.

10:48.710 --> 10:50.871
Maybe we should talk
in private.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.450
No. She's--
She's my girlfriend.

10:52.460 --> 10:53.870
You can tell us both.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.036
A crew out of Dungeness

10:59.880 --> 11:01.609
brought your dad's body up
in their nets.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.668
I need you to come
with me to identify him.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.285
[clicks]

11:38.330 --> 11:39.536
[Ryn]
Xander is here?

11:44.710 --> 11:46.075
[hisses]

11:47.330 --> 11:48.957
-[hisses]
-Whoa!

11:48.960 --> 11:50.416
-Whoa there.
-Back.

11:52.210 --> 11:53.746
Back, now.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.706
[soft hiss]

11:56.710 --> 11:57.745
Think.

11:58.830 --> 11:59.876
No fight.

12:03.460 --> 12:06.372
Goodbye. Nice day.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.495
[hisses]

12:11.830 --> 12:12.910
[door closes]

12:17.460 --> 12:19.610
[cell phone ringing]

12:23.250 --> 12:24.820
Hey, Mads.

12:24.830 --> 12:27.162
Dad, I've been
trying you forever.

12:27.170 --> 12:29.661
I'm sorry, honey.
There's, uh--

12:29.670 --> 12:31.240
There's no signal
in the morgue.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.786
Morgue, what are you --

12:32.790 --> 12:34.451
I'm here with Xander.

12:34.460 --> 12:36.530
Looking right at Sean.

12:36.540 --> 12:39.828
Oh, my God.
Is that why--

12:39.830 --> 12:42.822
No. I can't say much
right now,

12:42.830 --> 12:45.958
but Ben and all the boys
have been brought in
for questioning.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.747
The Feds are in town.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.411
What can I do?

12:50.420 --> 12:52.615
For your boyfriend,
not much right now.

12:52.620 --> 12:55.874
But, uh,
for your "ocean friends,"

12:55.880 --> 12:58.667
a safe haven might be
a way to go.

12:58.670 --> 13:00.069
Places could get
searched today.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.911
You know where they're at?

13:01.920 --> 13:04.377
With Helen. I'll call her
and get over there.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.699
Thanks, Dad.

13:05.710 --> 13:07.871
-I love you.
-[hangs up]

13:22.210 --> 13:23.996
Sign on the line.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.956
It just confirms date
and time of arrival,
no more.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.109
What's going on here?

13:28.460 --> 13:30.530
This is not the time, Ted.

13:30.540 --> 13:31.950
And you need
to let us handle this.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.996
Handle what? Hmm?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.319
One of my workers came to me,

13:35.330 --> 13:37.537
said he saw my son being put
in the back a cop car.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.610
Whatever this is,
I'm don't think you need
to be jumping 'em all

13:39.620 --> 13:40.996
through these
ridiculous hoops.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.615
Dad, stop.

13:42.620 --> 13:43.996
Actually, Ted,
there are procedures

13:44.000 --> 13:46.070
that we must follow,

13:46.080 --> 13:48.822
and there's nothing more
I can or will say
about it to you.

13:48.830 --> 13:52.072
Well, Sheriff,
this certainly is your domain.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.071
I don't presume
to tell you your business.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.877
Glad to hear it.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.495
Can I have a couple of moments
alone with my son, please?

13:57.500 --> 13:59.115
Alone, no.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.701
You can say what
you need to right here.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.281
Will you take the others
back please, Marissa?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.740
[Ted] Hey.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.035
Hey, what's going on?

14:11.040 --> 14:12.576
It's fine, okay?

14:12.580 --> 14:14.161
It's under control.
I got this.

14:14.170 --> 14:15.535
Let me help you, Ben.

14:15.540 --> 14:16.950
Tell me
what this is all about.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.200
I can't tell you.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.110
That bad, huh?

14:22.120 --> 14:24.111
Okay, well,
you have the right idea.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.111
You say nothing.
Not a word.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.281
I'm gonna call my lawyer.

14:28.290 --> 14:30.372
-Dad, I don't need your help.
-[phone beeps]

14:30.380 --> 14:32.496
Yeah, you do.
And so do your friends.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.910
-[line ringing]
-[Dale] Time's up.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.035
Not one word.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.109
Mm-hmm.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.489
This way, Ben.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.279
[hisses softly]

14:47.290 --> 14:49.997
What does she sense?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.956
Something wrong in her body.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.279
We don't know.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.991
[hisses]

14:57.000 --> 14:58.285
[blows]

15:01.210 --> 15:05.169
She say this happened
after Viv change back.

15:05.170 --> 15:06.455
From tank.

15:06.460 --> 15:08.496
Is there something wrong
with the tank?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.456
We only just refilled it.

15:10.460 --> 15:15.159
_ Tan_k_ water
IS not IIVIng water.

15:15.170 --> 15:16.819
No longer part of the ocean.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.206
Not good enough for us.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.370
[door opens]

15:21.380 --> 15:22.369
[Maddie] Hey.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.029
She's sick?

15:25.040 --> 15:26.610
[Helen]
We may have a problem.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.030
The tank wate_r_is
becoming InsuffICIent

15:28.040 --> 15:29.325
for these creatures.

15:29.330 --> 15:30.661
They need the real ocean.

15:30.670 --> 15:32.991
And they're gonna
get that. Very soon.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.410
Does she have
the strength to walk today?

15:34.420 --> 15:37.457
She say yes.
She knows there is trouble.

15:38.790 --> 15:39.779
Where is Ben?

15:41.210 --> 15:45.249
He's talking
to the police about Sean,

15:45.250 --> 15:46.239
Xander's dad.

15:46.250 --> 15:47.820
What happened with Sean?

15:49.080 --> 15:50.570
They found his body.

15:52.380 --> 15:53.608
Oh.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.248
Oh, God.
Does Patty know?

15:56.250 --> 15:59.117
Not yet. Xander wants
to tell her himself.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.417
What about the police?

16:00.420 --> 16:01.990
They're
asking questions.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.661
We don't want them
coming over here,

16:03.670 --> 16:05.706
looking for Levi
or anyone else.

16:05.710 --> 16:08.827
Yes. Pack will go
with Helen today.

16:08.830 --> 16:11.116
I stay here, help Maddie.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.247
[Helen]
Ryn is pretty assimilated.

16:13.250 --> 16:14.740
She'll be able
to blend in just fine.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.878
Okay. I'd like it
if you stayed, Ryn.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.029
Thank you.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.077
Where do I
take the rest?

16:22.080 --> 16:23.490
Somewhere out of town,
remote?

16:26.250 --> 16:27.535
I know place.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.110
You will keep them safe.

16:48.830 --> 16:50.240
How nice of you to join us.

16:52.460 --> 16:55.031
You know,
the Feds are coming.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.532
Meanwhile, get your heads
screwed on straight.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.326
[Ben]
We don't say anything.

17:04.330 --> 17:07.709
If none of us talk,
they've got nothing on us.

17:07.710 --> 17:09.826
It's the only way
to protect ourselves.

17:09.830 --> 17:11.036
You got it?

17:17.290 --> 17:21.374
[line ringing]

17:21.380 --> 17:22.916
Yo, you've reached XM,

17:24.290 --> 17:25.700
[beep]

17:29.960 --> 17:32.076
[line ringing]

17:35.380 --> 17:37.575
Ithought
you'd run away to sea.

17:37.580 --> 17:39.116
Sorry, sir.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.169
The past 24 hours
have been... intense.

17:42.170 --> 17:44.115
You out of your depth?

17:44.120 --> 17:47.578
No, Sir. In fact,
I found the one we need.

17:49.170 --> 17:51.320
-You're sure?
-Oh, yeah.

17:51.330 --> 17:52.536
I've been tracking,

17:52.540 --> 17:54.201
and I was led
straight to the Alpha.

17:54.210 --> 17:55.780
You should see this one.

17:55.790 --> 18:00.159
She's highly evolved.
Rational, even.

18:00.170 --> 18:03.037
Which leads me
to reconsider the strategy.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.576
Go on.

18:04.580 --> 18:07.378
It feels misguided
to capture by force.

18:07.380 --> 18:10.031
IfI can convince her
to come wnlllngly,

18:10.040 --> 18:11.667
I think we'll get
a lot more out of her.

18:14.750 --> 18:17.162
Okay, do it your way.

18:17.170 --> 18:19.161
You have 48 hours.

18:19.170 --> 18:20.205
[beep]

18:23.620 --> 18:25.611
I blame Calv_in
for whatever's gomg on.

18:25.620 --> 18:29.829
Seriously. He probably got
involved in God knows what.

18:29.830 --> 18:31.377
I love the guy,

18:31.380 --> 18:33.450
but he was, like, born
to sell stolen shit off a truck.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.609
[door opens]

18:37.250 --> 18:38.376
Hey.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.450
We haven't been
formally introduced.

18:44.460 --> 18:45.825
I'm Nicole.

18:47.380 --> 18:48.995
I am Ryn.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.377
Ryn. I've never heard
a name like that.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.415
Where's that from?

18:52.420 --> 18:54.376
Television.

18:56.420 --> 18:57.876
Have you heard from Xander?

18:57.880 --> 18:59.825
Any news?

18:59.830 --> 19:01.821
Uh, he was
taken in to identify
his father's body.

19:01.830 --> 19:02.956
Now he's in jail.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.167
Is that what this is about?

19:05.170 --> 19:06.239
Mads, you gotta
to go down there,

19:06.250 --> 19:08.286
get your dad
to get them out.

19:08.290 --> 19:10.167
Can you? Please?

19:12.170 --> 19:14.240
I'll go,
but I can't promise anything.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.411
_ I don't know _
If they'll even let me In.

19:16.420 --> 19:17.705
You guys go home,

19:17.710 --> 19:18.825
I'll call you.

19:23.460 --> 19:24.666
I go with Maddie?

19:24.670 --> 19:25.739
[door opens]

19:25.750 --> 19:27.536
Best plan is, you stay here.

19:27.540 --> 19:30.031
-You don't want to bump
into Deputy Marissa.
-[door closes]

19:30.040 --> 19:31.280
Remember?

19:31.290 --> 19:33.326
Okay. Yes. Not her.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.668
[engines start]

20:00.830 --> 20:03.116
So sorry.
I forgot to pee.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.530
Can I come in for a minute?

20:05.540 --> 20:06.700
Bathroom?

20:08.250 --> 20:09.285
Okay. Yes.

20:10.290 --> 20:11.416
[chain slides]

20:17.420 --> 20:19.786
Uh, actually, I'm good.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.610
I know who you are.

20:31.540 --> 20:33.280
I know... what you are.

20:33.290 --> 20:36.077
-[hisses]
-Hey, hey, calm down.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.320
This is not a big deal.

20:39.250 --> 20:40.285
I'm not gonna hurt you.

20:41.960 --> 20:46.329
I didn't expect you
to be so... human.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.457
Ryn is not human.

20:48.460 --> 20:49.916
Ryn is Ryn.

20:52.830 --> 20:54.320
Unique.

20:56.580 --> 20:58.821
I want to learn
all about you.

20:58.830 --> 20:59.876
Study you.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.489
So do my friends.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.320
Study Ryn.

21:06.540 --> 21:08.326
Like Ben and Maddie?

21:08.330 --> 21:09.706
Yes.

21:09.710 --> 21:13.111
But they can't protect you
like my friends can.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.572
You know you're
not safe here, right?

21:17.580 --> 21:18.319
I know this.

21:21.330 --> 21:23.537
My friends are powerful.

21:23.540 --> 21:25.701
What is powerful?

21:25.710 --> 21:28.702
They're people
who protect the country

21:28.710 --> 21:30.496
and can protect your pack, too.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.956
Soldiers.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.530
Soldiers hurt my sister.

21:35.540 --> 21:38.327
-That was a big mistake.
-You go. Now.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.909
Okay.

21:43.420 --> 21:46.912
Remember, I can protect
everyone you care about
if you help me.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.205
This can be our secret.

21:50.790 --> 21:51.996
[door opens]

21:53.710 --> 21:54.779
[soft hiss]

21:57.750 --> 21:58.876
[Dale] Thank you.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.611
Dad, can you
tell me anything yet?

22:05.620 --> 22:08.453
Honey, I'm sorry.
I-- I can't.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.371
Will I be able to see Ben?

22:10.380 --> 22:11.995
I don't know yet.

22:14.290 --> 22:15.279
I'll wait.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.206
[breathing hard]

22:19.210 --> 22:21.610
Xan, you gotta
get it together, man.

22:21.620 --> 22:23.417
You gotta stay calm.

22:23.420 --> 22:25.240
I'm trying, okay?
I'm gonna try.

22:25.250 --> 22:28.822
Hey, we don't
have to say a thing.

22:28.830 --> 22:30.206
All right? Not a word.

22:31.790 --> 22:32.996
[Marissa] Wait here.

22:35.210 --> 22:37.246
What the hell? Chris!

22:39.380 --> 22:41.371
Dude. Dude, what's going on?
What happened?

22:42.670 --> 22:44.786
The Feds,
they came and got me.

22:44.790 --> 22:47.611
I mean, they came in
with a chopper.

22:47.620 --> 22:49.201
Hey, guys!

22:49.210 --> 22:50.609
No talking.

22:50.620 --> 22:51.416
Let's go.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.747
[hawk shrieks]

23:04.460 --> 23:05.916
[hisses]

23:11.290 --> 23:12.496
Ah. Thank you.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.376
What are we gonna do?

23:20.380 --> 23:21.824
We don't know

23:21.830 --> 23:23.491
if Chris is gonna say
anything to them, okay?

23:23.500 --> 23:24.956
You saw him, man.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.076
He's strung out
on somethin'.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.162
He's gonna say
that a damn Merman
killed my father.

23:29.170 --> 23:31.161
So we gotta talk now, right?

23:31.170 --> 23:33.536
We have to say something.
We have no other choice.

23:33.540 --> 23:35.496
So screwed!
Man, we are so screwed!

23:35.500 --> 23:37.115
Hey, Xan, you need
to calm down, man.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.451
Are you trippin'?

23:38.460 --> 23:39.700
How can you tell
the man to stay calm

23:39.710 --> 23:40.574
when you were
the one who told him

23:40.580 --> 23:42.491
to wrap his dad up
in a damn tarp

23:42.500 --> 23:43.876
and feed him to the fish?

23:43.880 --> 23:47.418
Okay, I'm still saying
the same thing.

23:47.420 --> 23:50.071
_ It is better _
If we just stay qunet.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.786
Bullshit.
Whatever Chris tells them,

23:51.790 --> 23:53.997
they're not gonna believe him
if it's three against one.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.490
What about the fact
that my dad's got

23:55.500 --> 23:59.072
a great big ol' hole
in his chest?

23:59.080 --> 24:00.957
I mean, how are we gonna
talk our way around that?

24:00.960 --> 24:03.918
Maybe... Maybe
he got injured by a hook

24:03.920 --> 24:05.615
when he got caught up
in the net,

24:05.620 --> 24:07.372
and we just didn't
see it then, right?

24:07.380 --> 24:09.109
We just stick
to what _we've
always said, Xan.

24:09.120 --> 24:12.203
No. We keep our mouths shut,

24:12.210 --> 24:14.576
and we wait until
the lavwer gets here.

24:14.580 --> 24:17.617
I literally cannot
believe you, dude.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.781
That lavwer
is gonna be looking out
for one person in here,

24:19.790 --> 24:21.166
and it's you.

24:21.170 --> 24:23.661
My dad is gonna help
all of us, okay?

24:23.670 --> 24:24.955
I will make sure of that.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.167
Us? [scoffs]

24:27.170 --> 24:29.707
He doesn't give
a shit about us.

24:29.710 --> 24:31.871
He doesn't even know me!

24:31.880 --> 24:33.996
Let me tell you something,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.116
the people that spend
their lives tryin'
to make the damn rent,

24:36.120 --> 24:38.873
they're the ones
that go down first, okay?

24:38.880 --> 24:41.166
That's how it works, Ben.

24:41.170 --> 24:43.206
Xan and I are gonna fry,
while you,

24:43.210 --> 24:45.371
you're gonna walk off
home, clean, to Mommy.

24:45.380 --> 24:46.779
I would never let
that happen to you.

24:46.790 --> 24:48.496
I am done protecting
those things

24:48.500 --> 24:50.411
that you spend your life
whining over.

24:50.420 --> 24:52.160
Everything's gone to hell
since they've come into town.

24:52.170 --> 24:53.740
Right?

24:53.750 --> 24:56.742
The Feds want the truth,
they're gonna get it.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.069
They're gonna get it
from Chris,

24:58.080 --> 24:59.490
and they're gonna
get it from me.

25:02.380 --> 25:03.745
I'm not gonna get
push back from you.
Right, Xan?

25:03.750 --> 25:05.160
Come on,
tell me you don't care

25:05.170 --> 25:06.740
what happens
to those freakin' things.

25:06.750 --> 25:09.537
Make tacos with 'em
for all I care, man. I don't--

25:13.460 --> 25:15.075
I don't care what happens
to me anymore, either.

25:19.250 --> 25:20.569
So then it's set.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.497
We tell the truth.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.570
It was a Merman
that killed Sean.

25:26.580 --> 25:27.740
[laughing]

25:29.250 --> 25:30.660
All right, go ahead.
Go ahead.

25:30.670 --> 25:32.661
Try saying that
to the FBI.

25:32.670 --> 25:34.206
You're insane!

25:34.210 --> 25:35.950
They're
not the military, man.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.166
They don't know about this.

25:37.170 --> 25:38.706
Just shut up!

25:38.710 --> 25:40.666
[grunting]

25:40.670 --> 25:42.160
Hey! Hey! Stop!

25:42.170 --> 25:45.788
Stop it! Calvin, stop!
Okay? Stop!

25:45.790 --> 25:47.826
Both of you,
all right, all right.

25:47.830 --> 25:49.377
My dad wouldn't wanna
see any of this, so just...

25:50.790 --> 25:51.700
stop.

25:55.170 --> 25:56.660
It's over.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.956
[unlocking cell]

26:12.670 --> 26:13.659
The Feds want you.

26:15.670 --> 26:16.739
Let's go.

26:30.670 --> 26:32.069
I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

26:33.830 --> 26:35.821
He, um...

26:35.830 --> 26:36.706
He got caught in the net.

26:39.330 --> 26:40.820
What side of the deck
was he on?

26:41.830 --> 26:43.741
Um, it was the portside.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.324
Starboard.

26:47.330 --> 26:49.662
Definitely.

26:49.670 --> 26:52.241
What if I told you
Xander said there was no net?

26:55.880 --> 26:58.781
No net? Calvin said that?

26:58.790 --> 27:01.452
[Foster] How about Xander
telling us it was you

27:01.460 --> 27:02.825
that stabbed his father?

27:04.380 --> 27:07.281
I dunno, I'd--
I'd say he's whack.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.660
Crazy as the guy who said
it was a mermaid?

27:17.920 --> 27:18.955
It was me.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.286
I did it.

27:24.380 --> 27:26.280
We'd been working all night,

27:26.290 --> 27:30.784
and, yeah, Sean
got caught up in a net,

27:32.790 --> 27:34.166
but that's not how he died.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.529
I went to free him,

27:38.880 --> 27:40.745
I was holding
a gaffing pole.

27:40.750 --> 27:44.868
A wave hit,
and I went down.

27:44.880 --> 27:49.203
All my weight,
it went right into his chest.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.325
No one else saw this?

27:50.330 --> 27:51.877
It was dark.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.916
I don't know
where they were.

27:53.920 --> 27:57.663
We knew that it would
look bad for me, so...

27:59.380 --> 28:01.746
I told the guys that
we needed to wrap the body,

28:03.250 --> 28:04.786
bury it at sea.

28:09.830 --> 28:11.707
[sighs]

28:38.540 --> 28:39.666
[straining]

28:40.750 --> 28:41.819
Uhh!

28:46.920 --> 28:48.319
[sighs]

28:57.960 --> 28:59.700
[soft hiss]

29:04.960 --> 29:07.372
I'm Bill Groton,
your lawyer.

29:07.380 --> 29:08.916
Mm-hmm.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.785
Been getting acquainted
with Christopher here.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.871
So the bad news is

29:13.880 --> 29:17.031
the Feds didn't buy
a word of your stories.

29:17.040 --> 29:17.995
They're pressing charges.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.319
The good news is they indicated

29:21.330 --> 29:23.958
you were all
so wildly inconsistent,

29:23.960 --> 29:26.872
they find it hard to make
heads or tails of things.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.279
Mermaids?

29:28.290 --> 29:31.111
We need to drop
that angle.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.247
Now, they want to transfer you
to a federal detention facility.

29:33.250 --> 29:34.956
We're still waiting
for bail to be set.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.916
Now, you're the Pownall?

29:36.920 --> 29:38.956
Yeah.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.952
Okay, word of advice--
no more confessions.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.370
They might start to stick.

29:44.330 --> 29:47.037
Wait, he confessed?

29:47.040 --> 29:48.450
He tried.

29:48.460 --> 29:49.870
Good thing
they didn't buy it.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.074
[footsteps]

29:51.080 --> 29:54.243
[cell door opens]

30:04.830 --> 30:06.115
Guys, uh...

30:07.920 --> 30:09.114
I'm sorry.

30:09.120 --> 30:12.248
I tried to stick
to the story,

30:12.250 --> 30:14.912
but the truth,
it just kept comin' back

30:14.920 --> 30:16.319
in my head, man, you know?

30:18.120 --> 30:19.872
I didn't wanna screw it up.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.876
Don't worry 'bout it, okay?

30:23.880 --> 30:27.828
It's _ever since that...
thing sang to me.

30:29.670 --> 30:33.879
That night, my mind,
it was shot to pieces.

30:33.880 --> 30:36.326
Do you feel me, man?

30:39.080 --> 30:40.115
It's feels like you...

30:42.330 --> 30:44.321
you know what I'm saying.

30:44.330 --> 30:46.707
-Right?
-No.

30:46.710 --> 30:50.874
Look, um, I'm sorry,
that you haven't been...

30:51.830 --> 30:54.162
doing better.

30:54.170 --> 30:57.879
But look, man,
you did your best, okay?

30:57.880 --> 30:59.916
This wasn't your fault.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.490
It's good to see
you guys anyway.

31:05.580 --> 31:06.740
I missed you.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.877
Missed the sound
of the ocean.

31:15.380 --> 31:19.111
Yeah. Last time _we were
all in a place this small,

31:19.120 --> 31:21.372
we rented that two-man tent
instead of the big one.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.746
You guys remember that?
That Labor Day camping trip?

31:23.750 --> 31:26.787
Yeah, it was straight out
of a horror movie.

31:26.790 --> 31:28.951
You with your scaly feet.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.496
[Ben]
Wasn't all that bad, Cal.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.240
We let you in there alone
with that, uh...

31:32.250 --> 31:34.115
that girl from Germany.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.111
What was her name?

31:36.120 --> 31:37.496
Um...

31:37.500 --> 31:39.570
[all] Helga.

31:39.580 --> 31:41.787
Helga. [snickers]

31:41.790 --> 31:43.109
[chuckles]

31:47.710 --> 31:48.745
Ijust...

31:50.330 --> 31:52.161
Ijust really miss my dad.

32:03.170 --> 32:05.320
[police radio chatter]

32:11.210 --> 32:12.416
-[keys fall]
-[frustrated sigh]

32:16.210 --> 32:18.451
[crying softly]

32:24.880 --> 32:25.915
Maddie?

32:30.580 --> 32:32.207
You have pain inside.

32:32.210 --> 32:33.746
Ben's in big trouble.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.370
He's not even allowed
out of the station.

32:37.380 --> 32:39.075
My dad couldn't
let me see him.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.378
Why he can't leave?

32:41.380 --> 32:43.780
He's locked up.
In a cage.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.574
Like sister?

32:51.000 --> 32:52.319
When do they let him out?

32:52.330 --> 32:54.036
I don't know.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.166
I'm sorry.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.110
Maddie go home.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.496
Get rest. I come soon.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.706
Where are you going?

33:10.710 --> 33:12.871
Want to walk.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.279
Think. Like human.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.489
Okay.

33:16.500 --> 33:17.740
Okay.

33:30.750 --> 33:33.116
[Viv wheezing]

33:42.380 --> 33:44.280
Good place for us.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.246
Did you find this
when you went out on your own?

33:46.250 --> 33:47.740
[soft hiss]

33:52.330 --> 33:54.036
[water dripping]

33:58.500 --> 34:00.912

in The Anchor]

[door opens]

34:03.540 --> 34:05.167
[door closes]

34:18.540 --> 34:21.327
The soldiers.
Why they want Ryn?

34:22.750 --> 34:24.786
Because you're so strong.

34:24.790 --> 34:28.783
You can help humans
learn how to get stronger.

34:28.790 --> 34:31.202
You'll be helping
the people that you love.

34:34.580 --> 34:36.116
Ben and Maddie are love.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.199
It won't be hard on you.

34:41.750 --> 34:43.490
It won't hurt.
Not like your sister.

34:46.330 --> 34:48.571
I'm truly sorry
about that.

34:49.580 --> 34:50.740
It was all very new to us.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.661
I will help soldiers.

34:54.170 --> 34:56.161
But they must help Ryn, too.

34:58.460 --> 34:59.950
Now.

35:07.210 --> 35:10.247
[Helen] This area has
many cave paintings.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.242
These are probably
thousands of years old.

35:15.250 --> 35:18.458
Created
by our most ancient tribes.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.160

[soft hiss]

35:28.380 --> 35:29.449
[hisses]

35:31.960 --> 35:33.825
Not your words.

35:36.210 --> 35:38.246
[Helen] Not our words?

35:38.250 --> 35:40.206
Our words.

36:17.920 --> 36:18.955
[cell door unlocks]

36:25.830 --> 36:27.570
You are free to go.

36:29.290 --> 36:30.700
They've dropped
the charges.

36:40.330 --> 36:42.662
So was it the lawyer guy?

36:42.670 --> 36:43.819
Did he pull something off?

36:45.330 --> 36:47.378
I've been told
the case is closed

36:47.380 --> 36:49.826
on direct orders
of the US. Military.

36:51.290 --> 36:53.281
They wouldn't say more.

36:53.290 --> 36:56.418
Feds weren't too happy about
the waste of their time.

36:57.620 --> 36:59.417
The military?

36:59.420 --> 37:02.241
The best thing to do here
is not ask questions.

37:03.290 --> 37:06.919
Go home, all of you,
stay out of trouble.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.990
We got luclq today, guys.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.706
Don't forget that.

37:12.750 --> 37:16.038
Um, I'm gonna catch up
with you guys later, okay?

37:16.040 --> 37:17.530
Yeah, sure.

37:23.380 --> 37:24.415
[song playing]

37:24.420 --> 37:27.787
I need to, um,
pay a visit to my mom.

37:27.790 --> 37:28.745
[male singer]
Holdin' my breath

37:28.750 --> 37:30.320
Yeah.

37:30.330 --> 37:34.118
Comin' comin' comin'
for you

37:34.120 --> 37:37.283
I remember
holdin' you so tight

37:37.290 --> 37:40.202
Soft like a butter knife

37:40.210 --> 37:42.451
Slice me, dice me

37:42.460 --> 37:44.951
Let me feel you softly

37:44.960 --> 37:47.531
Slowly

37:49.380 --> 37:52.076
I'm inside my head,
inside my head

37:55.380 --> 37:57.530
I'm inside my head,
inside my

37:57.540 --> 38:01.032
Ooh-hoo ooh-hoo

38:06.080 --> 38:09.208
I'm inside my head,
inside my

38:10.210 --> 38:11.245
Xan.

38:11.250 --> 38:12.285
Hey, Mom.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.996

and tribes of sea."

Yeah.

All right. [laughs]

39:42.670 --> 39:44.786
Gonna be able
to lay my dad to rest.

39:46.620 --> 39:47.826
[male singer]
Give it up

39:58.880 --> 40:00.916
I'm gonna go get us
some drinks, okay?

40:00.920 --> 40:02.114
-Okay.
- Break my back

40:02.120 --> 40:04.327
I got a bag of shame

- Take it back

40:15.540 --> 40:18.327
Yeah. She will be.

She's got
some peace now, so...

Yeah.

[Ben] Hey, come on,
sit down.

40:40.710 --> 40:43.326
So the military
saves our asses, huh?

40:43.330 --> 40:44.740
What's up with that?

40:44.750 --> 40:46.877
They must have
a bigger plan.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.245
Why else
would they do it?

40:48.250 --> 40:50.115
[Xander]
All just happened so fast.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.702
One minute,
we're going down,
the next, we're out.

40:52.710 --> 40:54.575
I mean, someone must've
found out something.

40:54.580 --> 40:55.660
Unless...

40:57.670 --> 41:02.118
they've been here,
watchin' us this whole time.

41:07.580 --> 41:09.536
Oh please

41:09.540 --> 41:15.570
I'm singin'
through the past

41:15.580 --> 41:17.116
We can't take
any more chances.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.530
We gotta get them home.

41:18.540 --> 41:21.327
-Fast.
-Yes.

41:21.330 --> 41:23.321
You say you'll
take me to the world

41:23.330 --> 41:27.369
But I just need to play

41:27.380 --> 41:29.701
Give it up

41:31.620 --> 41:33.872
[high-pitched call]

41:37.080 --> 41:39.662
[music playing]
