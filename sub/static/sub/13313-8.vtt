"I carry your heart with me.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.887
I carry it in my heart.

51:37.887 --> 51:40.515
I am never without it."

51:40.515 --> 51:43.059
That's the poem.

51:43.059 --> 51:45.061
What?

51:45.061 --> 51:46.145
It's a poem.

51:46.145 --> 51:48.314
I read it in
the prison library.

51:48.314 --> 51:49.982
"Easy Comings."

51:49.982 --> 51:52.109
No capitals,
no periods,

51:52.109 --> 51:54.195
any of that shit.

51:54.195 --> 51:56.322
Just, you know,
buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

51:56.322 --> 51:58.699
I like that poem.

52:00.535 --> 52:04.705
What are you
talking about, Pop?

52:04.705 --> 52:08.501
Eh, just thinking about
my girl

52:08.501 --> 52:10.670
in Nevada.

52:10.670 --> 52:12.129
The singer?

52:12.129 --> 52:15.466
Yeah, the singer,
right.

52:15.466 --> 52:18.553
She's an angel.

52:18.553 --> 52:20.388
You'd love her, Bunch.

52:20.388 --> 52:21.180
You both would.

52:28.396 --> 52:29.772
[Mickey] What are you doing?

52:32.359 --> 52:33.192
[Bunchy] I got my girl.

52:35.152 --> 52:36.362
Let's go get yours.

You know, when we were kids,

53:20.781 --> 53:23.784
it wasn't--
it wasn't easy with him.

53:26.162 --> 53:27.872

Just that when
I was your age, I...
