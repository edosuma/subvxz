00:17.784 --> 00:20.378
<i>So, you're</i>
<i>finally settling down.</i>

00:20.453 --> 00:22.546
<i>You've saved up</i>
<i>a little nest egg</i>

00:22.622 --> 00:26.251
<i>and are ready to dive into</i>
<i>the real estate market.</i>

00:26.326 --> 00:28.726
<i>Let's do a little</i>
<i>shopping around.</i>

00:28.795 --> 00:30.194
<i>The American dream home.</i>

00:30.263 --> 00:31.855
<i>Two bedrooms, two bathrooms,</i>

00:31.931 --> 00:35.492
<i>one doghouse, one garage,</i>
<i>two garbage cans.</i>

00:35.602 --> 00:37.069
<i>It's cozy, safe,</i>

00:37.170 --> 00:40.264
<i>and just barely within</i>
<i>your overstretched budget.</i>

00:40.373 --> 00:41.704
<i>Not for you?</i>

00:41.775 --> 00:45.108
<i>For the same price,</i>
<i>you can buy 200, 000 acres</i>

00:45.178 --> 00:47.442
<i>of prime Sahara wasteland.</i>

00:47.514 --> 00:50.745
<i>Put up a cottage.</i>
<i>Nothing but you and the sky.</i>

00:50.817 --> 00:52.944
<i>It's like a beach</i>
<i>without the ocean.</i>

00:53.019 --> 00:55.385
<i>And talk about quiet neighbors.</i>

00:55.455 --> 00:58.686
<i>Too remote?</i>
<i>Oh, I understand.</i>

00:58.758 --> 01:01.693
<i>You need the thrill</i>
<i>and excitement of the big city.</i>

01:01.761 --> 01:03.285
<i>With that same nest egg,</i>

01:03.363 --> 01:06.093
<i>you can get a slice</i>
<i>of prime real estate.</i>

01:06.166 --> 01:07.929
<i>Not this real estate.</i>

01:08.034 --> 01:09.661
<i>Cozy and affordable,</i>

01:09.769 --> 01:12.704
<i>this lovely fixer-upper</i>
<i>is the perfect place</i>

01:12.772 --> 01:15.036
<i>for a dynamic couple like you.</i>

01:15.108 --> 01:17.167
<i>No need to putter around</i>
<i>the house.</i>

01:17.243 --> 01:20.144
<i>It's all right there</i>
<i>where you stand.</i>

01:23.316 --> 01:26.513
<i>What's the matter?</i>
<i>Feeling a little cramped?</i>

01:26.586 --> 01:28.986
<i>Well, just a stone's</i>
<i>throw away,</i>

01:29.055 --> 01:31.649
<i>just one bridge</i>
<i>or a tunnel ride,</i>

01:31.724 --> 01:34.818
<i>just outside the big,</i>
<i>bustling city,</i>

01:34.894 --> 01:38.159
<i>there is a place</i>
<i>with wide-open spaces,</i>

01:38.231 --> 01:41.632
<i>friendly natives,</i>
<i>and spacious dwellings.</i>

01:41.734 --> 01:45.170
<i>And it's all within</i>
<i>your price range.</i>

01:45.271 --> 01:49.537
<i>It's almost</i>
<i>too good to be true.</i>

01:56.683 --> 01:57.741
When I told you

01:57.817 --> 02:00.445
I had a particular building
in mind for you,

02:00.520 --> 02:02.511
this is the one
I was talking about.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.717
It's a historical home
on one of the best blocks

02:05.792 --> 02:07.384
in all of Brooklyn.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.258
- Remember what we talked about.
- I know. Poker face.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.888
Built-ins, built-ins.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.331
Oh, the kitchen's
a little small.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.595
Well, rip out this
awful room divider,

02:16.703 --> 02:19.137
and you've got
an eat-in kitchen.

02:19.205 --> 02:21.969
And over here
you have your library.

02:22.041 --> 02:22.666
Wow.

02:22.775 --> 02:23.833
For your books.

02:23.943 --> 02:25.103
Oh, you like books?

02:25.178 --> 02:28.705
I have a little collection
of first-edition novels.

02:28.781 --> 02:31.079
Alex is a writer.

02:32.252 --> 02:34.243
The parlor.

02:46.733 --> 02:49.258
Oh, my God.

02:51.204 --> 02:54.469
So, this staircase.
This leads to where?

02:54.541 --> 02:57.510
I thought you realized.
This is a duplex.

02:57.577 --> 03:00.307
As in two floors
for the price of one?

03:00.380 --> 03:03.543
I believe it's right there
in the listing sheet.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.083
So, why was it sealed off?

03:05.151 --> 03:08.552
Were there, like, a slew of
murders up there or something?

03:08.621 --> 03:12.079
No, there's just a sweet, little
old lady that lives upstairs.

03:12.158 --> 03:13.989
A tenant?

03:14.060 --> 03:14.754
Mm-hmm.

03:14.827 --> 03:17.625
So, rent control means
we can't kick her out, right?

03:17.697 --> 03:18.925
Alex!

03:18.998 --> 03:21.558
That's a legitimate question.
You cannot evict her.

03:21.634 --> 03:24.102
She has to decide to leave
or, God forbid...

03:24.170 --> 03:26.195
Poor thing hasn't been
feeling well lately.

03:26.306 --> 03:30.140
She's gotta be close
to 100 years old.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.678
Mrs. Connelly?

03:32.779 --> 03:35.111
It may take her a while.
She's hard of hearing.

03:35.181 --> 03:37.581
Mrs. Connelly?

03:47.460 --> 03:49.792
Kenneth.

03:49.862 --> 03:52.262
There's my favorite girl.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.698
How you feeling today,
Mrs. Connelly?

03:54.767 --> 03:57.031
I don't feel too good, Kenneth.

03:57.136 --> 04:00.128
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
Mrs. Connelly.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.176
I brought by a young couple that
may want to buy the apartment.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.643
- Hi.
- Hi, Mrs. Connelly.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.146
I'm Nancy Kendricks.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.580
This is my husband, Alex Rose.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.446
Hello.

04:11.517 --> 04:13.917
We were wondering
if we could look around.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.615
I don't feel up to it.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.918
I'm sorry, dear.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.755
Nice seeing you again, Kenneth.

04:33.640 --> 04:37.076
You have a Mommy-and-Me
park over here.

04:37.143 --> 04:38.906
You got shopping that way.

04:38.978 --> 04:41.139
No traffic.
It is ideal.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.910
Here's my card
if you want to make an offer.

04:43.983 --> 04:45.541
There's a lot of heat
on this place.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.416
I'd say it'll be
off the market by Monday.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.115
Adios.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.887
Three fireplaces?

04:58.965 --> 05:00.626
Guys, the place sounds
incredible.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.691
And surprisingly affordable.

05:02.769 --> 05:03.827
It's kind of affordable.

05:03.936 --> 05:06.461
It's really at the high end
of our price range.

05:06.572 --> 05:09.040
But when you factor in
that it's a duplex.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.507
It's a duplex?

05:10.576 --> 05:11.372
Yes.

05:11.444 --> 05:12.376
Oh.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.504
You know, it's Brooklyn,
first of all.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.276
We weren't even thinking
about Brooklyn, so...

05:17.350 --> 05:20.183
Oh, actually, which reminds me.
Did you bring it?

05:20.253 --> 05:21.049
Oh, yeah.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.749
Is this the latest in
the Don Piper mystery series?

05:24.824 --> 05:27.088
Fresh off the presses.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.060
I inscribed this copy
to you guys.

05:29.128 --> 05:30.686
- Oh!
- Coop, thank you.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.890
I am sure it's not
gonna be as brilliant

05:32.965 --> 05:37.026
as your new book, but a couple
decent metaphors in there.

05:37.136 --> 05:38.364
Turn of phrase.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.939
We forgot to tell them
the big news.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.769
Oh, God.
Yes.

05:42.842 --> 05:43.774
What is it?

05:43.843 --> 05:46.277
Go ahead.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.870
We're pregnant.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.149
Wow!

05:50.216 --> 05:51.945
Congratulations.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.212
Congratulations, man.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.378
I'm so happy for you!

05:54.454 --> 05:57.651
You guys must have
just found out.

05:57.724 --> 06:01.751
No. Unh-unh.
I'm four months along. Yeah.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.523
- Four months?
- Mm-hmm.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.291
- Oop!
- Oh, honey.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.525
Stop.

06:06.599 --> 06:08.328
Hello!

06:10.937 --> 06:13.269
I mean, we're not
gonna want to live here

06:13.339 --> 06:15.273
once we start having babies.

06:15.341 --> 06:18.310
And that upstairs would make
the cutest playroom.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.745
Well, I don't want Mrs. Connelly
coughing on my baby.

06:21.814 --> 06:23.304
You know what I mean.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.443
Besides, do you realize how much
the duplex is gonna be worth

06:26.519 --> 06:28.282
once we get both floors?

06:28.354 --> 06:29.480
I know how much it costs.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.750
It's gonna be worth
a bazillion times that.

06:31.824 --> 06:34.987
Really? A bazillion?
That's an incredible return.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.394
Come on, Alex, what better way
to finish your novel

06:38.464 --> 06:41.956
than in your own 19th-century
oak writer's nook?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.036
It would be nice
not to write at Starbucks

06:44.103 --> 06:45.661
with the other novelists.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.036
Because you deserve
your own nook.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.469
That's my train.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.341
All right.
Let's do it.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.005
Really?

06:55.081 --> 06:58.346
- Yeah.
- Aah!

06:58.418 --> 07:00.716
Oh, this is so wonderful.
We're gonna have a home.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.345
Yeah. All right.
I love you.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.411
I love you!

07:24.143 --> 07:27.010
I could have sworn
we had more stuff.

07:27.079 --> 07:28.774
It's gonna look great.

07:30.082 --> 07:33.745
Mrs. Connelly, it's
Nancy Kendricks and Alex Rose,

07:33.820 --> 07:35.981
from downstairs.

07:36.055 --> 07:38.023
Let me look at you.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.122
Oh!

07:43.196 --> 07:44.595
Hi.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.861
We just wanted to come up
and say hi.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.368
Oh, what a nice surprise.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.233
Come in.
Come in.

07:52.338 --> 07:53.965
Thank you.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.906
Wow.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.171
What an amazing apartment!

07:59.245 --> 08:02.305
Oh, thank you, dear.
Sit down.

08:02.381 --> 08:04.645
We brought you this
little housewarming gift.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.651
That's very kind of you.
Thank you.

08:06.719 --> 08:09.085
I'll open it for you.
I don't drink, myself.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.713
It's a sin.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.816
Irish Catholics don't drink?

08:23.569 --> 08:25.332
What are you doing?

08:25.438 --> 08:29.431
Oh, I'm just taking a few
little pictures for research.

08:30.510 --> 08:34.537
If I knew you
were coming, I'd have tidied up.

08:39.751 --> 08:40.719
Hey, Nancy.

08:40.785 --> 08:41.775
Yeah?

08:41.854 --> 08:44.186
Blow me down!

08:45.191 --> 08:47.056
- Oh!
- What did you say?

08:47.126 --> 08:49.560
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Oh, God!

08:49.629 --> 08:53.929
I'm coming, slowly but surely.

08:55.568 --> 08:58.799
- I'll just turn off this music.
- Alex! Alex!

09:02.608 --> 09:04.940
Sit down, dears.
Sit down.

09:05.678 --> 09:09.170
I've brought you a little
something to nibble on as well.

09:09.248 --> 09:12.274
Oh, Bugles.
Wow.

09:12.351 --> 09:15.013
I didn't realize
they even still made Bugles.

09:16.789 --> 09:18.689
Here you go.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.653
That's a magnificent parrot.

09:24.730 --> 09:28.427
It's not a parrot, dear.
He's a macaw.

09:28.501 --> 09:32.460
He's named after
my late husband, Richard.

09:33.539 --> 09:37.600
I've had Little Dick
for 40 years.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.279
Come along, dear.
Don't be shy.

09:41.347 --> 09:42.541
It's French onion.

09:42.615 --> 09:43.445
Oh.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.694
Mrs. Connelly,
how are you feeling?

09:56.762 --> 09:58.195
Why do you ask, dear?

09:58.264 --> 10:02.394
Well, because the last time
we saw you, you were quite ill.

10:02.468 --> 10:07.531
Oh, I had a bit of a cold,
but I'm in fine fettle now.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.733
Tell me about yourselves.

10:09.842 --> 10:12.504
What do you do, Alan?

10:12.578 --> 10:13.237
Alex.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.303
Alex is a writer.

10:15.381 --> 10:17.679
Oh, a writer.
Hmm.

10:17.750 --> 10:22.050
I always thought of that as
more of a hobby than a real job.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.386
I suppose I'm forgetting
about Joyce.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.289
Joyce. James Joyce.
Of course.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.349
Wonderful writer.

10:28.427 --> 10:31.225
He died drunk and penniless.

10:32.832 --> 10:37.394
Well, Alex's first novel
was published in hardback,

10:37.503 --> 10:39.596
and he's about
to finish his second one.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.673
Oh, what's it about?

10:41.774 --> 10:45.767
Well, I like to call it
an urban epic.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.778
It's about three generations
of this family

10:47.847 --> 10:50.475
that own a printing press,
and I tell a story.

10:50.549 --> 10:55.486
That's nice.
Let me give you a refill.

10:55.554 --> 10:59.115
Big Dick had the taste, too.

10:59.191 --> 11:01.421
He was a seaman.

11:01.494 --> 11:06.727
The drink took him
from me in 1963.

11:06.799 --> 11:10.997
We'd been married for 58 years.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.637
'63.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.676
So, when are you two
planning on having children?

11:17.777 --> 11:18.766
Soon.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.869
Yeah, not for a couple of years.

11:20.946 --> 11:24.177
You sound just like
Mr. Connelly.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.014
We never had any children.

11:27.086 --> 11:29.077
It's too late for me now.

11:30.656 --> 11:32.817
Oh, look at the time.

11:32.892 --> 11:35.952
I had no idea it was so late.

11:36.028 --> 11:36.824
Oh.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.796
The time's rolled on.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.560
We haven't had a chance
to see the apartment.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.932
Oh, dear, I'm afraid
there's no time now.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.162
Really?

11:45.271 --> 11:47.000
We must say good night.

11:47.106 --> 11:49.506
Oh, okay.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.378
Oh.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.379
Uh-oh.

11:57.149 --> 12:00.084
Oh, no. That was your...
I think it's your couch.

12:00.152 --> 12:02.245
- I think the chair...
- Alex.

12:02.321 --> 12:04.255
That was a little...

12:04.323 --> 12:06.655
Come along, dears.
Come along.

12:06.692 --> 12:07.386
How could you?

12:08.360 --> 12:12.387
"A macaw. Any long-tailed,
brightly colored parrot."

12:12.465 --> 12:14.956
A macaw is a parrot.
I knew it.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.594
Don't you think that
as landlords,

12:17.703 --> 12:19.170
we have some legal right

12:19.238 --> 12:21.900
to see the back of her apartment
if we want to?

12:22.007 --> 12:24.237
I mean, I'll look it up
on the Internet.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.334
That's what I'll do.

12:25.444 --> 12:26.638
I wonder how old she is.

12:26.712 --> 12:35.120
Oh, my guess is that she's
somewhere between 95 and 105.

12:37.056 --> 12:40.253
- She looked pretty good tonight.
- Yeah, she did.

12:41.660 --> 12:44.595
She looked kind of healthy.

12:44.663 --> 12:46.961
Yeah.

12:47.032 --> 12:48.192
That's nice.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.666
Yeah.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.173
Hi.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.280
Hello, Mr. Peabody.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.884
I saw myself in the mirror,

13:08.954 --> 13:11.718
and I thought it was
my mother's tush.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.996
Mrs. Connelly?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.432
Mrs. Connelly?

13:24.537 --> 13:27.028
Oh, yes?

13:27.139 --> 13:28.470
Who is it?

13:28.541 --> 13:29.803
Hi, it's Alex.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.571
I was wondering if you
could turn down your TV,

13:32.645 --> 13:34.840
'cause we can hear it.

13:34.914 --> 13:38.816
Oh, I fell asleep.
I'm sorry.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.909
- That's okay.
- I'll do that.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.783
Okay.
Thank you.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.195
No, Starvin' Marvin,
that's my potpie.

13:51.263 --> 13:52.389
Cartman, you butt-pipe.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.364
This is the time of year
to share.

13:54.433 --> 13:55.764
Oh, yeah, you're right.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.666
Are you going to eat
your peach cobbler?

13:57.770 --> 14:01.467
No, you don't want all that.
Why don't you share it with me?

14:01.540 --> 14:03.269
Everybody's
asking me about fiber.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.707
In the next few minutes,

14:04.777 --> 14:07.575
you're going to learn about
an amazing...

14:11.016 --> 14:13.211
If I want a slimmer waist.

14:13.285 --> 14:15.981
Use it on carpets. OxiClean
seeks out organic stains.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.250
There's no more bald jokes.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.269
I gotta go. Have a good day.
See you later.

14:39.345 --> 14:40.539
And finish that chapter!

14:40.613 --> 14:41.910
I will.

14:58.764 --> 15:01.255
- Good morning, Alex.
- Good morning, Mrs. Connelly.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.960
I wanted to give you this back.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.730
I won't drink it,
and I thought you might want it.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.898
Oh, thank you.
That's nice of you.

15:09.008 --> 15:12.239
All right, if there's anything
I can do for you, let me know.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.849
There is one thing.

15:23.889 --> 15:26.221
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I don't hear anything.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.351
It was very distinctive.

15:28.427 --> 15:32.864
The pipes went
bang-bang-bangity-bang-bang.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.696
Bang! Bang!

15:36.635 --> 15:38.762
Well, they're not
doing that anymore,

15:38.871 --> 15:41.362
or it stopped,
so, I'll tell you what, though.

15:41.473 --> 15:44.533
If you hear it again,
come get me. I'll take a listen.

15:44.643 --> 15:46.611
Oh, all right then.
It's a deal.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.943
Ooh, Alan, dear boy, I wonder...

15:49.014 --> 15:50.948
- Alex.
- Pardon?

15:51.016 --> 15:52.540
Alex.
My name's Alex.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.051
I know.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.916
No, I think you said "Alan."

15:55.988 --> 15:58.218
Oh, no, I don't think so.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.088
I don't forget names.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.594
Could you give me a hand
with the garbage?

16:03.662 --> 16:06.324
We don't want to be
feeding the mice.

16:27.419 --> 16:31.719
What in heaven's name
are you doing with me drawers?

16:32.825 --> 16:36.090
Now, I would move
the pull quote just a teeny bit

16:36.161 --> 16:38.857
so that you'll have room
to squeeze in the text.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.899
You're such
a good squeezer, Nancy.

16:40.966 --> 16:42.627
That's because, until yesterday,

16:42.701 --> 16:45.397
I lived in an apartment
the size of a small child.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.268
But look at the new place.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.637
Oh, my God!

16:49.708 --> 16:51.198
- Isn't it gorgeous?
- Yes.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.245
There's, like,
this living room/parlor area.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.781
Nancy, did you finish
the "Celebrity Scene" page?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.214
Oh, tickety-boo.

16:58.283 --> 16:59.648
I don't know what that means.

16:59.718 --> 17:00.844
It means you'll have it soon.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.910
Well, if you mean
I'll have it soon,

17:02.988 --> 17:05.047
why don't you say
I'll have it soon?

17:05.124 --> 17:08.958
"Tickety-boo"
is just confusing for everybody.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.693
Oh, Mr. Peabody.
How did that get in there?

17:13.766 --> 17:15.324
Ohh.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.906
Alex?

17:26.645 --> 17:27.805
Alex?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.438
Hey.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.278
Hi!

17:31.350 --> 17:34.046
Hi.
How was work?

17:34.119 --> 17:37.179
Oh, Herman's freaking out,
as usual.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.316
Were you napping?

17:39.391 --> 17:43.487
No, I was just rearranging
my book collection.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.530
In the dark?

17:45.597 --> 17:47.656
And then I closed my eyes
for a second.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.395
Just to think, and, you know.
Is this dinner?

17:50.502 --> 17:53.232
Mm-hmm.
So, how was your nook?

17:53.338 --> 17:56.398
Did you get, like, five
or six million pages written?

17:56.508 --> 17:58.999
More like five or six words.

17:59.111 --> 18:02.376
Our upstairs neighbor had me
doing chores for her all day.

18:02.448 --> 18:03.312
Really?

18:03.382 --> 18:04.906
Yeah.

18:04.983 --> 18:07.213
Well, you just gotta set
some boundaries.

18:07.286 --> 18:10.221
Just tell her you're working.
She'll understand.

18:10.289 --> 18:11.415
What is that?

18:11.490 --> 18:14.357
Oh, I picked up a few things
on the way home.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.916
It's an area rug.

18:15.994 --> 18:17.791
- Do you love it?
- Yes. How much was it?

18:17.863 --> 18:19.831
It doesn't seem
to cover much of an area.

18:19.898 --> 18:22.128
It was $200
or something like that.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.600
I don't really remember.

18:23.669 --> 18:24.601
That was 200 bucks?

18:24.703 --> 18:27.103
Yeah, but, you know,
it's a runner,

18:27.172 --> 18:28.833
'cause it goes in between
the two rooms

18:28.941 --> 18:30.499
and then ties them together.

18:30.609 --> 18:34.136
Ooh, and look!
Look, look, look, look, look!

18:34.213 --> 18:37.080
It's an original Pablo Flinch.

18:37.149 --> 18:38.912
Really? Cool.

18:38.984 --> 18:44.012
Is it, like, a Mayan
guacamole bowl or something?

18:44.089 --> 18:46.785
It's a stool.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.554
Here.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.094
Try it.

18:53.265 --> 18:54.698
What are we, hobbits?

19:02.941 --> 19:05.341
It's a water stain!

19:05.410 --> 19:09.278
I told Mr. Rose the problem
with the pipes this morning.

19:09.348 --> 19:11.942
They were going
bang-bang-bangity-bang-bang.

19:12.017 --> 19:14.884
Bang. Bang.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.215
Yeah, the whole bathroom

19:16.288 --> 19:18.017
could have explode.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.115
471 bucks.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.990
What time?

19:24.029 --> 19:26.156
- You were here three hours?
- Yeah.

19:26.231 --> 19:29.359
Sweetie, these were
original tiles.

19:29.434 --> 19:30.901
How could you not hear banging?

19:31.003 --> 19:32.402
Sweetie, I was asleep!

19:32.471 --> 19:35.133
Napping, and in the middle
of the afternoon.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.037
Shameful.

19:37.943 --> 19:40.104
I'm not gonna pay
for unauthorized repairs.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.669
I did the work, my friend.

19:41.747 --> 19:43.647
I can rip the pipes
out of the wall.

19:45.651 --> 19:46.345
What?

19:48.287 --> 19:50.118
I don't know what you're saying.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.383
Do it! Do it!

19:51.456 --> 19:53.321
You do it.
You do it.

19:53.392 --> 19:55.417
- Alex!
- What?

19:55.494 --> 19:57.223
Okay, forget it.
Plug it up.

20:00.332 --> 20:02.630
I begged Mr. Rose
to do something.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.601
I was terrified, Nancy.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.796
Okay, well, the next
time that happens,

20:06.905 --> 20:08.805
Mrs. Connelly,
just call me, okay?

20:08.874 --> 20:10.341
I gave you my business card.

20:10.442 --> 20:15.641
Alan, before I forget,
it's the first of the month.

20:17.182 --> 20:18.080
Right.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.209
$88.

20:20.519 --> 20:22.953
Do you want to count it?

20:24.356 --> 20:28.019
Remember, if she bothers you,
just lay down the law.

20:28.093 --> 20:31.187
Be firm, but nice.
Two positives, then a negative.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.026
- What is that?
- Psychology.

20:33.098 --> 20:35.464
Don't wait up for me.
I got to work late.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.934
- I love you.
- I love you.

20:59.891 --> 21:01.188
Good morning, Alex.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.955
Good morning, Mrs. Connelly.

21:03.028 --> 21:06.225
I wondered if I could ask you
a quick question.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.131
Right.
You know what?

21:11.236 --> 21:14.069
Can I just say this to you?

21:14.139 --> 21:16.232
You know I'm working
on a book, right?

21:16.341 --> 21:18.639
And this book is due
in about three weeks.

21:18.710 --> 21:22.578
And my editor is expecting it
on her desk at that time, okay?

21:22.648 --> 21:24.639
- It's a contractual deadline.
- I see.

21:24.716 --> 21:27.344
So I have to be working
on that book all the time

21:27.419 --> 21:29.979
here in my apartment,
which is also my office.

21:30.055 --> 21:31.181
It's just like my office.

21:31.256 --> 21:33.520
If I was a lawyer,
and I went off to an office,

21:33.592 --> 21:36.891
you couldn't knock on my door,
'cause you wouldn't be there.

21:36.962 --> 21:40.363
So let's just pretend
that I'm a lawyer, okay?

21:40.432 --> 21:41.490
This is my office,

21:41.566 --> 21:46.868
and unless it's a really, really
super-important emergency, okay,

21:46.972 --> 21:50.408
between the hours
of 9:00 and 6:00, I'm not here.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.069
I'm off,
away in my office, okay?

21:53.145 --> 21:56.842
And then after 6:00,
I'm here, okay?

21:56.915 --> 21:58.678
I completely understand.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.980
And I apologize
for bothering you.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.749
Not at all. Okay,
have a good day, all right?

22:03.822 --> 22:05.255
It's just...

22:06.958 --> 22:10.792
What? What is it just?
What is it?

22:14.132 --> 22:17.659
I bought a copy
of your book yesterday,

22:17.769 --> 22:20.897
and I wondered if you'd sign it.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.133
Of course, if you're too busy,

22:23.241 --> 22:27.678
I can come back
out of business hours.

22:27.779 --> 22:30.873
Oh. No.
That... no.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.349
Oh, that's so nice.
You didn't have to buy a copy.

22:34.419 --> 22:37.479
- I have a million copies.
- It's money well spent.

22:37.556 --> 22:41.617
Just write something that I
can treasure for years to come.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.718
Okay.

22:47.599 --> 22:54.528
How about, "To my favorite
upstairs neighbor"?

22:54.639 --> 22:56.766
Signed "Alex Rose."

22:56.875 --> 22:59.343
Here you go.
And I hope you like it.

22:59.411 --> 23:00.537
Oh, I know I will.

23:00.612 --> 23:03.274
Okay. All right.
Good day.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.213
Alex?

23:05.984 --> 23:07.144
Yeah?

23:08.019 --> 23:10.510
I know we've just had
this discussion,

23:10.589 --> 23:13.956
but I was wondering
if the firm of Rose & Rose

23:14.025 --> 23:16.960
could accompany an old lady
to the pharmacy.

23:17.028 --> 23:19.326
It's pissing down out there.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.993
And I need to renew
my monthlies.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.730
It won't take any time at all.

23:25.837 --> 23:34.040
30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36...

23:34.112 --> 23:36.012
How much is the Nicorette?

23:36.081 --> 23:38.106
$43.97.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.479
I lost me place.

23:43.555 --> 23:48.322
One, two, three...

23:48.393 --> 23:53.387
8, 9, 10...

23:53.465 --> 23:58.698
1, 2, 3...

23:58.804 --> 24:06.506
22, 23, 24...

24:06.578 --> 24:12.448
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30.

24:12.517 --> 24:14.576
Okay, good?

24:15.854 --> 24:20.723
Oh, blueberries.

24:21.526 --> 24:24.893
1, 2, 3...

24:24.963 --> 24:26.954
I thought you
were gonna talk to her.

24:27.032 --> 24:28.192
I did, honey.
I did.

24:28.266 --> 24:31.360
I was very clear with her.
She's just...

24:31.470 --> 24:34.837
She manipulated me somehow.

24:34.906 --> 24:37.807
She manipulated you?

24:37.876 --> 24:40.709
She's very crafty.

24:40.779 --> 24:45.239
She's a crafty old lady.

24:46.551 --> 24:48.678
Well, I'll tell you what.

24:48.753 --> 24:51.187
Tomorrow's gonna be better,
because you know why?

24:51.256 --> 24:54.020
It's gonna be Saturday,
and that's our day off,

24:54.092 --> 24:56.026
and we're gonna get to sleep in.

24:56.094 --> 24:57.994
- Okay?
- Yeah.

24:59.097 --> 25:02.260
I promise everything
will be better tomorrow, okay?

25:31.162 --> 25:32.993
Good morning.

25:38.236 --> 25:40.261
Good morning, Nancy.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.132
This is Nancy Kendricks.

25:43.241 --> 25:44.674
Hello, dear.

25:44.743 --> 25:46.802
Are those musical instruments?

25:46.878 --> 25:48.675
Yes!

25:48.747 --> 25:51.079
We are a brass ensemble.

25:51.149 --> 25:54.949
We've got a concert
at St. Augustus on Friday.

26:00.525 --> 26:02.823
Let's go out shopping.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.396
I'll deliver it this afternoon?

26:11.503 --> 26:12.561
Yes, that's great.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.104
Hey, honey, look.

26:14.172 --> 26:15.605
Oh!
Oh, what'd you get?

26:15.674 --> 26:17.232
Remington Royal.
50 bucks.

26:17.342 --> 26:18.900
How much were
they asking for it?

26:19.010 --> 26:20.807
50 bucks.

26:23.515 --> 26:25.449
Look, I got a peacock.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.449
Oh.

26:26.518 --> 26:28.008
- Isn't it great?
- Cool.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.417
What does it do?

26:29.487 --> 26:31.478
It's there to be decorative
and pretty

26:31.556 --> 26:33.490
and aesthetically pleasing.

26:33.558 --> 26:35.458
So what do we need a daybed for?

26:35.527 --> 26:37.791
Oh, for all your napping.

26:37.862 --> 26:40.228
Honey, I took one nap
for two minutes.

26:40.298 --> 26:41.890
I didn't even shut my eyes.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.298
Hey, what's in the bag?

26:43.368 --> 26:45.359
Answer to our prayers.

26:45.470 --> 26:49.463
Try it next to that one,
'cause then the couch will go...

26:49.574 --> 26:52.771
Whoo#hoo#hoo#hoo#hoo.

26:52.844 --> 26:54.812
Wow.

26:58.950 --> 27:02.113
You know what I just realized
that we forgot to do?

27:02.187 --> 27:05.281
We forgot to christen
the apartment.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.325
That's what I was thinking.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.896

27:24.175 --> 27:26.643
I love our home.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.049
Aah!

27:34.052 --> 27:37.749
- What was she doing?
- Oh, my God.

27:37.822 --> 27:40.120
I don't know. You think
she saw the whole thing?

27:40.191 --> 27:41.215
Ew!

27:45.764 --> 27:47.527
Hey, where are you going?

27:47.599 --> 27:50.227
Oh, now's my chance.
I got to get up there.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.360
Wait.
What are you gonna do?

27:52.470 --> 27:54.062
The answer to our problems.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.799
- Clap Me.
- What does it do?

27:55.907 --> 27:57.898
When she falls asleep,
we can control her TV.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.033
You be the lookout.

27:59.144 --> 28:01.772
If you hear her coming,
knock on the pipe, okay?

28:01.846 --> 28:02.904
Like, make a noise.

28:02.981 --> 28:04.005
Okay. Okay. Okay.

28:05.884 --> 28:06.714
Shut up.

28:06.785 --> 28:08.343
Shut up.

28:30.809 --> 28:31.241
Hello.

28:31.309 --> 28:36.110
Well, hello, Little Dickey.
I'm back again, aren't I?

28:36.181 --> 28:38.376
Guess what I've got in the bag.

28:38.450 --> 28:42.216
I got hot dogs.
Hot dogs for Dickey boy.

28:42.287 --> 28:44.278
I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

28:44.355 --> 28:47.518
I'm going to give it
a wee chew meself first.

28:47.592 --> 28:49.389
Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

28:51.863 --> 28:55.230
Mm. It's so nice, Dickey.
It is.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.790
It's so good.

28:56.868 --> 28:58.597
Mm.

28:59.471 --> 29:00.802
I tell you what.

29:00.872 --> 29:03.636
Shall we have a bit of music?

29:03.708 --> 29:06.040
A bit of music
and a bit of a dance.

29:06.111 --> 29:09.740
I'll put on your favorite,
the tune you like the most.

29:09.814 --> 29:13.079
The one that was
Big Dick's favorite, too.

29:23.862 --> 29:25.420

Mrs. Connelly?

30:40.405 --> 30:42.339
Hold on a sec.

Mrs. Connelly?

30:45.243 --> 30:46.710
Oh, Nancy.

30:46.811 --> 30:50.144
What a nice surprise.
I'll make you some tea.

30:50.215 --> 30:52.115
It's nice to see you here.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.174
We'll have some tea.

30:54.252 --> 30:55.742
Oh!

30:55.820 --> 30:57.481
And biscuits.

30:57.555 --> 30:59.523
Ow! Ooh!

Honey?

31:03.695 --> 31:05.526
Oh!

31:05.597 --> 31:08.464
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

31:08.533 --> 31:11.468
What happened to you? You were
supposed to be the lookout.

31:11.569 --> 31:14.538
I know.
I know.

31:21.412 --> 31:23.380
All right, here we go.

31:23.448 --> 31:25.348
- Ready?
- Yeah.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.550
You're a genius!

32:22.840 --> 32:25.365
That is so weird.

32:25.476 --> 32:28.912
How would she know that? How
would she know how to use it?

32:28.980 --> 32:33.178
You didn't leave the box
up there or anything, did you?

33:28.806 --> 33:30.569
Nancy Kendricks.

33:30.641 --> 33:33.439
Nancy, Mrs. Connelly.
I have a favor to ask.

33:33.511 --> 33:34.637
Emergency!

33:34.712 --> 33:35.974
Hurry!

33:36.047 --> 33:37.139
Run!

33:37.215 --> 33:39.649
Mrs. Connelly,
you know, honestly,

33:39.717 --> 33:41.116
we're going to print today,

33:41.185 --> 33:43.176
and everything's
just crazy around here.

33:43.254 --> 33:44.687
Can't you ask Alex?

33:44.756 --> 33:45.984
I knocked and knocked.

33:46.057 --> 33:48.992
He must be in
a deep, deep sleep today.

33:49.060 --> 33:51.187
We didn't get it
until this morning.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.059
Nancy! Nancy!

33:53.131 --> 33:55.224
We have 27 minutes
to get this to press.

33:55.299 --> 33:56.459
Get off the phone!

33:56.534 --> 33:59.332
Okay, thank you, Mrs. Connelly.

33:59.437 --> 34:01.405
Where is my new hot list?
Where is it?

34:01.506 --> 34:02.564
I'm almost done.

34:02.673 --> 34:04.971
- 5 seconds!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.806
- Okay. Okay.
- Hurry!

34:07.578 --> 34:08.601
This is it?

34:08.679 --> 34:09.610
Yes.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.648
- Did you check it?
- Yes.

34:11.716 --> 34:15.208
I don't want it tickety-boo.
I want it tickety-now!

34:18.456 --> 34:20.185
It's good. It's cute.
I like it.

34:20.257 --> 34:22.123
Is it, like,
800, 900 square feet?

34:22.193 --> 34:24.353
No, it's, like, 1,800.

34:24.429 --> 34:26.920
But it might seem cozy
'cause of the fireplaces.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.659
There are 3 fireplaces.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.963
So, here it is.
The third fireplace.

34:31.069 --> 34:34.004
Wow.
This apartment is amazing.

34:34.072 --> 34:37.803
I'm so glad that you like it.
Whew. Relief.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.239
Wonderful collection.

34:39.310 --> 34:40.641
- Mmm, thank you.
- Yeah.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.371
Just make sure you save space

34:42.447 --> 34:44.677
for the Alex Rose
first editions.

34:44.748 --> 34:45.716
Ah, yes.

34:45.783 --> 34:47.444
So.

34:47.518 --> 34:48.712
So, yeah.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.514
How's the ending turning out?

34:50.588 --> 34:52.851
The ending is gonna be great.

34:52.924 --> 34:56.087
I'm kind of circling it
'cause I don't want to force it.

34:56.159 --> 35:00.187
Just make sure you
turn it in by Wednesday.

35:01.199 --> 35:04.930
Management's being very strict
with all our mid-level authors.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.264
I'm only mid-level?

35:06.370 --> 35:07.997
Right now.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.439
Of course, you won't be after
you hand in your masterpiece.

35:11.509 --> 35:13.943
We're replacing most
of the furniture we have,

35:14.011 --> 35:16.206
but we're going
for a Miller/Eames look.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.611
You love Eames, Terrence.

35:17.682 --> 35:18.876
I just got a new piece.

35:22.487 --> 35:25.786
Did you bring that guy with
the girl in the leopard thing?

35:25.857 --> 35:27.347
Oh, that's Chick.

35:27.425 --> 35:30.952
That's the guy who's advising me
on the Don Piper mysteries.

35:31.028 --> 35:33.087
What, is he a detective
or something?

35:33.164 --> 35:34.722
No.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.892
He's a hired gun.

35:37.502 --> 35:39.493
He kills people for a living.

35:39.604 --> 35:42.300
You brought a hit man
into the party?

35:42.406 --> 35:43.737
Relax.
He's very discreet.

35:43.808 --> 35:47.335
He's got a perfectly legitimate
day job as a cover.

35:47.411 --> 35:49.641
And what do you do, Chick?

35:49.714 --> 35:51.944
I'm a pornographer.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.746
Here, let me give you a card,
you know, just in case.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.790
She's this funny old Irish lady
named Mrs. Connelly,

35:59.857 --> 36:02.985
and she's actually in a brass
ensemble at the church tonight.

36:03.060 --> 36:05.221
There's all sorts
of incredible details.

36:05.296 --> 36:07.560
I mean, I can't wait
for you guys to see it.

36:07.632 --> 36:11.466
It's beautiful.
Ooh, Herman, get in here.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.776
Herman?

36:29.754 --> 36:31.779
Being a landlord
doesn't give you the right

36:31.856 --> 36:34.689
to enter your tenant's premises
anytime you feel like it.

36:34.759 --> 36:37.819
I just wanted my friends
to have a look-see.

36:37.895 --> 36:40.363
You were supposed to be
at the church performing.

36:40.431 --> 36:43.127
Heavens no.
It's next Friday.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.965
We've got a big week
of practice ahead of us.

36:46.070 --> 36:47.901
You terrified the poor woman.

36:48.005 --> 36:50.473
Mrs. Connelly, you can press
charges if you want.

36:50.575 --> 36:52.133
No, I don't want to do that.

36:52.243 --> 36:55.337
They're such a nice couple.
Good night, now.

36:55.413 --> 36:57.506
Good night, Mrs. Connelly.

36:59.750 --> 37:03.880
I'm gonna be watching
the two of you very closely.

37:06.824 --> 37:09.418
- Hey, Alex, right?
- Hey, Chick.

37:09.493 --> 37:12.121
How you doing?
Brought you a housewarming gift.

37:12.196 --> 37:13.527
Oh, that's so sweet.

37:13.598 --> 37:16.999
Well, look,
this is very tasteful stuff.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.262
You know, for couples.

37:18.369 --> 37:21.634
That is so thoughtful.
Thank you.

37:21.739 --> 37:24.230
My card's inside "Ass Patrol,"
in case you need more.

37:24.342 --> 37:25.309
Take it easy.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.241
- Thanks for the party.
- Okay.

37:27.311 --> 37:29.905
I got an award for this one.

37:41.659 --> 37:43.286
She was supposed to be
at church.

37:43.361 --> 37:45.591
You can't fire me
because you got maced.

37:45.663 --> 37:47.358
Believe me.

37:47.431 --> 37:50.332
I wish that's why
I was firing you.

37:50.401 --> 37:55.338
Did you happen to see
the restaurant hot list?

38:02.446 --> 38:04.505
Oh, my God.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.316
So...

38:10.855 --> 38:13.722
How's Mr. Peabody doing?

38:19.730 --> 38:21.664
Alex?

38:21.732 --> 38:24.200
Oh.
Oh, no, no, no.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.997
There's no napping right now.

38:26.103 --> 38:29.595
You have to finish your book.
We need money. I got fired.

38:29.707 --> 38:31.572
Yeah, I know.
I saw it.

38:31.642 --> 38:34.941
Oh, you saw it.

38:35.012 --> 38:38.106
Yeah. It's horrible.
My parents read this magazine.

38:38.182 --> 38:41.583
Now they know my penis
is called Mr. Peabody.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.279
It wasn't my fault.

38:43.354 --> 38:45.914
She was calling me
when you were napping.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.221
I wasn't napping,
for the 1,000th time!

38:49.293 --> 38:51.784
Okay, maybe I took a nap
at one point.

38:51.862 --> 38:53.887
When did napping
become against the law?

38:53.964 --> 38:57.798
Honey, I can't work here. It's
impossible. I've been trying.

38:57.902 --> 39:00.132
I've written three pages
in the last six weeks.

39:00.237 --> 39:02.637
Three pages.
The book is due on Wednesday.

39:02.707 --> 39:05.699
If we don't hand in the book, I
don't know what we're gonna do.

39:05.810 --> 39:08.404
We can't pay for anything.
The runners, the stools.

39:08.479 --> 39:10.743
We can't pay for the
tangelo bowl you like.

39:10.815 --> 39:15.582
We can't pay for your
little happy mug-vase thing.

39:15.653 --> 39:17.814
Well, what if you
got out of the house

39:17.888 --> 39:21.187
and went to write at, like,
a Starbucks or something?

39:21.258 --> 39:23.886
And what? You're gonna stay here
and try to find work

39:23.961 --> 39:27.260
while she has you running around
doing things for her?

39:27.331 --> 39:31.324
Doing all the little errands,
the chores she asks you to do?

39:31.435 --> 39:33.403
I don't think you could take it.

39:33.504 --> 39:36.564
I mean, I love you,
but, honestly,

39:36.674 --> 39:39.507
I've been there, and I don't
think you could take it.

39:40.511 --> 39:42.411
I can take it.
I'll be fine.

40:01.332 --> 40:03.095
Nancy?

40:04.902 --> 40:06.836
- Hello, Mrs. Connelly.
- Nancy, dear.

40:06.904 --> 40:11.102
I couldn't help noticing that
Alex left the house this morning

40:11.175 --> 40:12.665
while you stayed home.

40:12.777 --> 40:15.337
I was downsized from my job.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.779
Aw, I'm sorry.

40:17.848 --> 40:19.679
But I'm sure it's for the best.

40:19.750 --> 40:23.686
Let Mr. Rose get out there
and bring home the bacon.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.381
I always thought it was strange.

40:25.456 --> 40:29.688
A husband staying home while
you were out there providing.

40:29.760 --> 40:30.920
Well, he's a writer.

40:30.995 --> 40:32.656
Writer.

40:32.730 --> 40:36.496
The man naps more
than a newborn pup.

40:36.567 --> 40:39.127
What's he writing about?
Sheep?

40:39.236 --> 40:41.204
Is there something,
Mrs. Connelly?

40:41.305 --> 40:44.570
Oh, I guess you could say
there was something.

40:44.642 --> 40:48.237
I've got something on display
in me kitchen.

40:50.147 --> 40:52.081
That is not a mouse dropping.

40:52.149 --> 40:53.878
It's a raisin.

40:53.951 --> 40:57.250
That is the leavings
of a mouse.

40:57.321 --> 40:59.482
It's a raisin.

41:03.894 --> 41:07.091
I sprayed it with Lysol.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.960
Ohh.

41:11.068 --> 41:15.334
And she puts on this sweet face,
and she acts all innocent.

41:16.073 --> 41:19.099
Nancy, could you help me?

41:20.077 --> 41:23.046
I think I found
the leavings of a mouse.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.343
As if she didn't know
it was a raisin.

41:27.418 --> 41:28.646
I know.

41:37.928 --> 41:41.523
I've never designed
religious leaflets, per se.

41:41.599 --> 41:44.363
1:00. Great, Rabbi.
Thank you so much.

41:44.468 --> 41:45.366
Nancy?

41:45.469 --> 41:47.300
Okay.

41:47.404 --> 41:49.599
Nancy?

41:49.707 --> 41:52.904
Nancy?
Are you down there?

41:54.378 --> 41:55.845
What is it, Mrs. Connelly?

41:55.913 --> 41:59.747
Little Dickey's caught
in the dumbwaiter shaft.

41:59.817 --> 42:02.217
Well, how did he get there?

42:02.286 --> 42:03.275
Aaah!

42:04.455 --> 42:07.424
Oh, don't hurt him.

42:11.095 --> 42:13.359
Oh, ooh, Dickey boy.

42:13.430 --> 42:15.523
Oh, careful.

42:15.599 --> 42:17.931
Aah!

42:19.069 --> 42:20.696
Shame on you.

42:20.804 --> 42:23.432
Scaring a helpless,
little macaw like that.

42:23.474 --> 42:25.339
Scaring a helpless,
little macaw like that.

42:27.578 --> 42:29.011
This is not going well.

42:29.079 --> 42:32.071
I told you she's a mean,
crafty old lady.

42:32.149 --> 42:34.344
At this rate, I'm never gonna
finish the book in time.

42:34.418 --> 42:36.010
Damn rent control.

42:36.086 --> 42:38.350
I wish we could just
kick her out.

42:38.422 --> 42:40.754
What if we tried
being nice to her?

42:40.824 --> 42:43.486
Maybe we could get her a gift.

42:43.561 --> 42:44.789
- A gift?
- Yeah.

42:44.862 --> 42:48.161
And ask her if
she wouldn't mind leaving.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.824
- We ask her?
- Yeah.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.128
Just ask her?

42:51.201 --> 42:54.728
Maybe it'll take
a little begging, but nicely.

42:55.806 --> 42:57.671
Well, she might go for begging.

43:06.483 --> 43:11.113
There's a chart that shows
what's inside of each chocolate.

43:11.188 --> 43:12.985
That's all right, dear.

43:13.057 --> 43:15.992
Mrs. Connelly,
let me come right to the point.

43:16.060 --> 43:18.858
Alex and I are trying
to have a baby.

43:18.929 --> 43:20.453
I saw.

43:20.531 --> 43:22.260
In the living room.

43:22.333 --> 43:24.267
Right.

43:24.335 --> 43:26.633
The thing is,
when we do have our baby,

43:26.737 --> 43:28.932
we're gonna need the upstairs.

43:29.039 --> 43:31.473
I don't understand, dear.

43:31.542 --> 43:34.875
We're willing to pay you
something.

43:34.945 --> 43:36.503
You want me to leave?

43:36.580 --> 43:38.810
Don't you think
you'd be more comfortable

43:38.882 --> 43:43.342
with people who are more
in your demographic?

43:43.420 --> 43:47.356
In sunny Miami Beach.

43:49.193 --> 43:53.323
I'm Irish.
I'd sizzle up like a sausage.

43:53.397 --> 43:57.629
Besides, this is my home.

43:57.701 --> 43:58.497
Home.

44:01.005 --> 44:04.406
The Emerald Isle, hmm?

44:04.475 --> 44:07.444
Back to the old sod.

44:08.212 --> 44:11.978
Well, now, there's a thought.

44:12.049 --> 44:16.486
I haven't been back home
for 50 years.

44:17.454 --> 44:18.386
Ooh.

44:19.423 --> 44:21.789
A caramel.

44:32.002 --> 44:34.027
So, about Ireland.

44:34.138 --> 44:36.606
And you moving there.

44:37.241 --> 44:41.268
Most likely
they have television now?

44:41.345 --> 44:42.039
Oh.

44:42.112 --> 44:43.079
Of course they do.

44:43.180 --> 44:44.772
Yeah, color.

44:54.658 --> 44:57.354
I've made up me mind.

44:57.795 --> 44:59.888
I'll do...

45:07.538 --> 45:08.562
Mrs. Connelly!

45:08.672 --> 45:10.139
- She's choking!
- Oh, God!

45:10.207 --> 45:11.674
- Mrs. Connelly.
- Do something!

45:11.775 --> 45:13.936
Oh, God!
Ooh, Alex! Alex!

45:14.011 --> 45:16.605
Come on!
Come on!

45:16.680 --> 45:18.147
- Yeah, good.
- Come on!

45:18.215 --> 45:19.876
Come on!

45:24.321 --> 45:25.948
Whew!

45:26.023 --> 45:27.081
Oh, my God!

45:27.157 --> 45:28.749
Oh!

45:30.494 --> 45:31.586
Clear!

45:34.031 --> 45:35.464
Alex, what are you doing?

45:35.532 --> 45:36.464
CPR!

45:36.533 --> 45:39.525
Wait! Stop it!
Stop it!

45:40.037 --> 45:44.633
Oh, God.
One, two, three, four, five.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.937
Okay, give her mouth-to-mouth.

45:47.010 --> 45:49.342
- Oh, no. Really?
- Yes. Yes, do it!

45:49.413 --> 45:50.675
Okay.

45:51.682 --> 45:55.345
No, you got to blow
in her mouth. Come on.

45:55.419 --> 45:56.681
One breath, come on.

45:56.754 --> 45:59.746
One, two, three, four, five.

45:59.823 --> 46:01.051
Okay, again.

46:02.793 --> 46:04.385
Okay, one breath.
That's it.

46:04.461 --> 46:07.692
One, two, three, four, five.

46:07.765 --> 46:08.993
Again!

46:16.373 --> 46:17.772
Oh.

46:21.378 --> 46:24.347
What are you doing?

46:25.682 --> 46:28.742
You were choking on a chocolate.

46:30.287 --> 46:32.118
You choked on a chocolate.

46:35.759 --> 46:37.784
Oh.

46:38.695 --> 46:42.131
Oh. Oh.

46:42.699 --> 46:44.792
Go on, Mrs. Connelly.

46:44.902 --> 46:49.362
The last thing I remember,
I ate one of their chocolates.

46:49.473 --> 46:53.910
And when I woke up,
he was having his way.

46:53.977 --> 46:56.002
And she was holding me down.

46:56.079 --> 46:57.910
No, I was trying
to save her life.

46:57.981 --> 47:02.884
He stole me drawers once
for sniffing.

47:02.953 --> 47:03.977
That's ridiculous.

47:04.054 --> 47:06.488
She was choking on the
chocolate, so I did--

47:06.557 --> 47:08.923
Shut up!

47:08.992 --> 47:12.120
We keep a list of people like
you down here at the station.

47:12.196 --> 47:14.630
The sexual predator list.

47:14.698 --> 47:16.689
Sexual predator?

47:16.767 --> 47:20.726
And to think
they want to have children.

47:21.939 --> 47:23.873
We should've just let her choke.

47:24.007 --> 47:26.066
Oh, I know.

47:39.122 --> 47:40.612
What can I get you?

47:40.691 --> 47:42.955
Listen, I got 12 hours
to finish this book.

47:43.026 --> 47:45.290
I was wondering if I could
sit here and write all day.

47:45.362 --> 47:47.489
- Be my guest.
- Thanks.

48:00.010 --> 48:01.841
Nancy.

48:01.912 --> 48:04.244
I was going to ring you.

48:04.314 --> 48:08.580
I'm afraid there's a bit
of a problem up here.

48:08.652 --> 48:11.746
I have to go on a job interview,
so I'll take care of it later.

48:11.822 --> 48:15.622
Oh, that's okay.
I'll ring the rug man.

48:22.766 --> 48:25.064
Good.
Knock it in.

48:25.168 --> 48:26.726
Knock it in good.

48:26.837 --> 48:29.772
I don't want to slip
and break me neck.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.671
No, we wouldn't want that.

48:31.742 --> 48:34.506
This is the problem area here.

48:34.578 --> 48:37.274
It's loose as a Dublin whore.

48:37.347 --> 48:40.180
Oh, go on, knock it in.

48:44.187 --> 48:45.984
Yes!

48:46.990 --> 48:48.924
Now, just knock it in.

48:48.992 --> 48:50.960
Go on, knock.

48:51.028 --> 48:53.428
Come on, use some elbow grease.

48:53.497 --> 48:55.795
Aah!
Okay, I will.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.597
You threw her down the stairs?

49:06.610 --> 49:08.202
No.

49:08.278 --> 49:11.372
But I imagined it.

49:11.448 --> 49:14.212
And I liked it.

49:14.284 --> 49:15.376
I'm evil.

49:15.452 --> 49:18.546
I'm a horrible, horrible person.

49:18.622 --> 49:20.681
Thank you.

49:20.757 --> 49:23.282
Come on, she's practically
ruined our lives.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.385
It's natural to have thoughts
like that.

49:25.462 --> 49:28.397
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:28.465 --> 49:31.366
I mean, I've even had a couple.

49:32.502 --> 49:33.730
Aaaah!

49:36.039 --> 49:37.939
Like what?

49:38.008 --> 49:40.272
Just, you know,
snapping her neck

49:40.344 --> 49:42.904
or electrocuting her.

49:44.348 --> 49:46.077
You know,
just beating her to death,

49:46.149 --> 49:48.276
decapitating her,

49:48.352 --> 49:50.877
drowning her, just,
you know, bludgeoning her,

49:50.954 --> 49:54.412
in a humane way, but...

49:54.491 --> 49:58.222
Dicing her up
into little, little pieces.

49:58.295 --> 50:02.459
But asphyxiating her first
so she didn't feel anything.

50:02.532 --> 50:04.523
I'm glad you clarified that.

50:04.601 --> 50:07.195
You're evil, too.

50:07.304 --> 50:10.398
I'm finished.
That's what I am.

50:10.507 --> 50:12.099
And it was incredible.

50:12.209 --> 50:14.177
The last 60 pages
just poured out of me.

50:14.244 --> 50:17.338
Let's open that really great
champagne and celebrate.

50:17.414 --> 50:18.506
Alex?!

50:18.582 --> 50:21.176
Alex?!
Nancy?!

50:22.886 --> 50:25.116
Ooh!
Come quick.

50:25.188 --> 50:28.851
A huge rat just ran
under me cupboard.

50:28.925 --> 50:30.859
Oh, come.
Come on, quick.

50:30.927 --> 50:31.859
Quick, Alex!

50:31.928 --> 50:34.260
- I'll pop the cork.
- I'll be right back.

50:34.331 --> 50:36.856
Are you sure it was a rat,
Mrs. Connelly?

50:36.933 --> 50:38.628
I saw its face.

50:38.735 --> 50:40.794
You saw its face?

50:40.904 --> 50:45.932
All right, let's see if we can't
find this big, bad rat.

50:46.043 --> 50:48.341
You sure it might not
have been a dust bunny?

50:48.412 --> 50:50.539
'Cause sometimes
they look rodent-like.

50:50.614 --> 50:52.912
Aah!
The rat!

50:52.983 --> 50:54.644
- Where?
- There!

50:54.718 --> 50:56.447
Oh.
Oh, that's not a rat.

50:56.520 --> 50:58.988
That's like
a little field mouse.

51:01.224 --> 51:04.455
Alan!
Your purse fell into the fire.

51:04.528 --> 51:05.460
Oh, no.

51:05.529 --> 51:07.520
Alan!

51:08.965 --> 51:10.455
Oh, don't!
Oh, don't!

51:10.534 --> 51:12.092
My book!

51:12.202 --> 51:14.102
Ow!

51:14.171 --> 51:15.502
Oh, Alan!

51:15.572 --> 51:17.938
Oh!
Oh!

51:19.209 --> 51:21.268
You'll burn yourself!

51:21.344 --> 51:23.437
Door!
Nancy, door!

51:23.513 --> 51:25.879
Get the door!
Nancy, door!

51:25.949 --> 51:27.143
Is that your book?

51:27.217 --> 51:28.650
Okay.
Oh!

51:28.718 --> 51:31.118
- Door!
- Okay! Oh, my God!

51:36.193 --> 51:37.421
Oh!

51:39.262 --> 51:40.991
No!
No!

51:41.064 --> 51:43.032
- No! No! No!
- Alex!

51:43.100 --> 51:46.035
Stop!
No, stop!

51:53.977 --> 51:56.070
Aah!
No!

51:56.146 --> 51:58.171
No!

52:07.357 --> 52:10.554
I swear she did that on purpose.

52:26.176 --> 52:28.838
And now
here's tonight's Health Watch.

52:28.912 --> 52:31.346
A deadly
virus has hit New York City.

52:31.414 --> 52:33.644
Doctors warn that this
particular strain

52:33.717 --> 52:36.015
is extremely dangerous
in children under 5

52:36.086 --> 52:38.179
and especially to the elderly.

52:38.255 --> 52:39.950
Symptoms include high fever,

52:39.990 --> 52:40.513
Symptoms include high fever,

52:40.590 --> 52:43.616
accompanied by nausea
and violent diarrhea.

52:45.428 --> 52:47.692
Mr. Rose?

52:47.764 --> 52:50.528
Would you sprinkle some salt
on the steps?

52:50.600 --> 52:52.033
They're terribly icy.

52:52.135 --> 52:54.603
You better not go outside then.

52:56.640 --> 52:59.370
Ow!
Ow!

53:01.344 --> 53:03.175
Mother--

53:05.515 --> 53:08.416
A giant tow truck
runs it over,

53:08.485 --> 53:11.921
followed by an S.U.V.
That it was dragging.

53:11.988 --> 53:13.615
Alex, that's horrible.

53:13.690 --> 53:16.682
I know.
I know.

53:16.760 --> 53:18.625
Can you believe it?

53:18.695 --> 53:21.095
No, I can't.

53:21.164 --> 53:22.722
I tried to warn you, Alex.

53:22.799 --> 53:26.929
We're canceling every contract
that's in breach.

53:27.037 --> 53:30.837
In breach?
I have the crushed PowerBook.

53:30.907 --> 53:33.000
I'm sorry, darling.

53:33.109 --> 53:34.906
If you put as much energy
into your work

53:34.978 --> 53:36.343
as you do into excuses,

53:36.413 --> 53:38.176
you might have made
the deadline.

53:38.248 --> 53:40.341
- Do you have the shark?
- Yes, we do.

53:40.417 --> 53:43.909
Excellent.
I'm gonna have that, no bones.

54:19.823 --> 54:21.313
Hi.

54:38.508 --> 54:40.840
How do you feel?

54:40.910 --> 54:43.970
Like I'm knocking
on death's door.

54:51.788 --> 54:53.813
Well, look who's here.

54:53.890 --> 54:56.450
Come in, both of you.

54:57.727 --> 54:59.160
Hi, Mrs. Connelly.

54:59.229 --> 55:00.628
Happy Thanksgiving.

55:00.697 --> 55:01.629
Oh, thank you.

55:01.698 --> 55:05.134
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm grand.

55:05.235 --> 55:06.600
But how are the two of you?

55:06.703 --> 55:09.695
You look rather sallow.

55:09.806 --> 55:11.831
No, no.
We're fine.

55:11.941 --> 55:13.568
We brought you some popcorn.

55:13.643 --> 55:16.339
Oh.
Oh, how lovely.

55:16.413 --> 55:20.645
I adore popcorn.
So does Little Dick.

55:20.717 --> 55:24.118
So, did you have a nice
Thanksgiving dinner?

55:24.187 --> 55:26.087
Oh, yes, dear.

55:26.156 --> 55:29.614
That lovely Italian lady
in the post office

55:29.693 --> 55:31.354
brought me a sumptuous dinner.

55:31.428 --> 55:33.623
The only problem is
some of the carcass

55:33.697 --> 55:37.224
didn't go down the disposal.

55:37.300 --> 55:40.997
That's 'cause you don't have
a disposal.

55:41.104 --> 55:42.696
I don't?

55:55.352 --> 55:57.820
It's really stuffed up.

56:15.138 --> 56:17.038
All right!

56:23.680 --> 56:27.047
If you ask me, you two have got
some sort of bug.

56:30.286 --> 56:34.814
Thank God Officer Dan took me
to have a flu shot last week.

56:34.891 --> 56:37.951
Upchuck is a delicacy
for Little Dick.

56:38.027 --> 56:38.891
He's salivating.

56:38.928 --> 56:40.555
He's salivating.

56:42.465 --> 56:44.023
How much can we get, Kenneth?

56:44.100 --> 56:47.092
That depends on how far you're
willing to drop the price.

56:47.170 --> 56:50.139
First of all, you way overpaid.

56:50.240 --> 56:51.639
And then you got that tenant.

56:51.708 --> 56:54.643
You said
she was a sweet old lady.

56:54.711 --> 56:57.202
Oh, I can't imagine those words
coming out of my mouth.

56:57.280 --> 57:00.078
So you're saying that we're
stuck in this hellhole?

57:00.150 --> 57:03.779
Yeah. Unless you're willing
to take a huge, huge loss.

57:03.853 --> 57:05.047
How huge?

57:05.121 --> 57:07.385
Huge, huge.

57:07.457 --> 57:10.221
We're just totally
screwed, right?

57:10.293 --> 57:13.421
Yeah. I would say
screwed is apt.

57:13.496 --> 57:16.590
Do you think that Jean would
ever give you a second chance?

57:16.666 --> 57:18.793
No.
No, it's over.

57:18.868 --> 57:20.893
Besides, how could I have time
to rewrite my novel

57:21.004 --> 57:22.938
and still do my faithful
servant duty to her

57:23.006 --> 57:26.169
as her little
indentured servant person,

57:26.242 --> 57:28.005
her little butt boy?

57:28.077 --> 57:29.544
I mean, I got a lot of duties.

57:29.612 --> 57:32.046
'Cause she might need me
to count grapes with her

57:32.115 --> 57:35.983
or help her fix her heater
or go take her to the laundry.

57:36.052 --> 57:38.145
Or I gotta go help her
clean her banana skins

57:38.221 --> 57:41.281
and I gotta go help her
clean out her garbage

57:41.357 --> 57:42.949
or go and wipe her ass!

57:43.026 --> 57:45.586
God forbid she should have
any shit hanging off her ass!

57:45.662 --> 57:47.459
- Alex.
- No. Really.

57:47.530 --> 57:49.361
'Cause then I gotta run
like a little bunny

57:49.432 --> 57:52.560
and I have to go up there and
I gotta go wipe her little ass.

57:52.669 --> 57:54.500
And then I have to go, "Oh,
good for you, Mrs. Connelly,

57:54.604 --> 57:56.572
for having such a nice,
little poopy.

57:56.639 --> 57:57.867
You got some poopy
on your diapie?

57:57.974 --> 58:00.670
Ooh, let me go and clean it off
with my tongue!"

58:00.743 --> 58:01.869
Excuse me, sir.

58:01.945 --> 58:03.207
I mean, enough is enough!

58:03.279 --> 58:05.645
Excuse me.

58:05.715 --> 58:08.411
Off we go, Dickey boy.

58:11.054 --> 58:12.146
Okay.

58:12.222 --> 58:14.588
Okay, come on.
We don't have that much time.

58:14.657 --> 58:15.919
I know.
She's running errands.

58:15.992 --> 58:18.688
That only gives us 12 hours.

58:21.364 --> 58:24.561
You, there.
Me, there.

58:39.449 --> 58:42.748
A little salt in her sugar bowl.

58:42.819 --> 58:44.047
Hey, come check this out!

58:44.120 --> 58:45.678
Roger.

58:47.957 --> 58:48.753
Alex?

58:48.825 --> 58:50.850
Tripped on the rug.
I'm all right.

58:52.595 --> 58:54.256
You sure you know
what you're doing?

58:54.330 --> 58:56.457
I rewired the lamp
in your office.

58:56.533 --> 58:59.195
Cool. 'Cause if the shock
doesn't get her,

58:59.302 --> 59:01.202
a little bit
of gas poisoning should.

59:01.304 --> 59:03.829
Out goes pilot one.

59:05.708 --> 59:07.505
Out goes pilot two.

59:09.178 --> 59:11.339
An hour at 375 ought to do it.

59:11.414 --> 59:15.180
Did you remember to blow out
the pilot for the oven?

59:15.251 --> 59:16.218
Oh.

59:16.286 --> 59:17.776
Honey.

59:40.643 --> 59:42.838
Alex.

59:42.912 --> 59:44.846
The stain is dripping on us.

59:44.914 --> 59:46.882
I know.

59:46.950 --> 59:49.612
Isn't it soothing?

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:12.374
- Alex.
- Hi.

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:15.308
We got a water stain downstairs,
so I got to look at the pipes.

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:17.403
What has happened to your face?

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.244
Oh, I just fell asleep in one
of those tanning machines.

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:23.149
You look like a roast mutton.

01:00:24.053 --> 01:00:26.248
How are you doing, mutton head?

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:27.914
I'm almost done.

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:29.720
Ah!

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:51.139
On the average,

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:54.479
she gets up to change
the channel 19 times a night

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:57.713
walking this 48-inch footpath.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:59.687
By the time she gets
to the back end

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:01.553
of that "Hawaii Five-O"
marathon,

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:03.148
the acid should have eaten
through the floorboards.

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:05.319
And we'll finally be happy.

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:07.090
It wasn't our fault,
Officer Dan.

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:09.222
You should find the plumber.

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:10.595
- Right?
- Right.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:21.269
You know, we might want to get
a hotel room just in case.

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:26.745
Sweetie, now that we have a hole
in the ceiling,

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:29.808
I thought maybe it could be
a new place

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:31.285
for the staircase to go.

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.379
Yeah.
Looks good.

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:37.416
Where are you going?

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:39.290
A little insurance.

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:44.033
Alex, no!
Not Mr. Peacock.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:48.867
Honey, Mr. Peacock's gonna have
to take one for the team, okay?

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:08.987
That's it.

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:11.117
She's watching "Riverdance."

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.458
I didn't know people still
watched "Riverdance."

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:30.537
You know, this is actually
harder than it looks.

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:42.280
Holy Mary and Joseph!

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:45.657
I could have fallen
right through.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:52.326
The floorboards here,
they're rotten to the core.

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:55.393
Awhile back she hired this
Russian guy to fix the pipes.

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:57.029
And I don't know
if you noticed,

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:00.439
but there's all this
water damage that he left.

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:04.105
With all due respect
to Mr. "D", Alex,

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.809
you were up here yourself
fiddling with me pipes

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:10.182
a few days ago.

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:12.187
Fiddling with her pipes, huh?

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.519
Now, that's another fine
right there.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.784
For what?

01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:18.725
You can't plumb without
a license in New York City.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.127
Plumb?
I can't plumb?

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:24.325
Are you sassing me, Mr. Rose?

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.027
He's not sassing you.

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:27.966
Yeah, no, I'm not sassing you.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.537
I'm not.

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:30.731
I didn't think so.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.671
'Cause I know
a city building inspector

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:35.939
that eats chickenshit slumlords
like you for lunch.

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:38.207
You got it?

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:40.078
I get it.
You know, slumlord--

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:44.609
And you're gonna buy
Miss Connelly a brand-new TV.

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:48.623
In fact, Miss Connelly,
I'm gonna pick it out myself.

01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:52.787
Oh! Could you get one of
those clappy things?

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:53.954
It makes my viewing
so much easier.

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:56.521
It makes my viewing
so much easier.

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.363
Smoke.
Smoke, smoke.

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:07.738
Mesca.
Loot, loot.

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:09.603
Gun?

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:10.907
What?

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.675
Gun.

01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:17.684
Gun?

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:18.981
Gun?

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:27.296
So this is what it's come to?

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:30.431
I guess so.

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:42.077
I don't think
I've ever held a gun be--

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.588
I think I've got everything
I need here.

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:55.248
We've got an unlicensed
gun charge,

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:57.087
and then pending
an investigation--

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.786
It was an accident.

01:04:58.861 --> 01:04:59.759
It's my experience

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:02.059
that wives don't accidently
shoot their husbands

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:03.928
in the penis.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.367
And as much as this particular
man might deserve it,

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:12.464
spousal abuse is a very serious
crime in this state.

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:16.641
You two have a good night now.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:24.142
He thinks you're abusing me.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.017
Well, you did shoot me.

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:30.188
You're very lucky.

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:31.954
Your hand deflected the bullet

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.928
away from the tissue
of the actual organ

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:36.089
and just nicked the scrotum.

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:41.364
What about the,
you know, the berries?

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:46.702
Oh.

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:49.711
<i># Wake up, wake up,</i>
<i>wake up, wake up #</i>

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:52.805
<i># Oh, baby, now,</i>
<i>let's get down tonight #</i>

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:54.611
You feel that?

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:58.184
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

01:05:58.254 --> 01:06:00.279
- That's good.

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:02.916
Okay. I'm gonna run
a few more tests,

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:05.859
but I think you should be
out of here by tomorrow.

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:10.195
Poor Mr. Peabody.

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:12.757
He took one for the team.

01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:15.564
I just think that we're going
about this murder thing

01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:16.638
all wrong.

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:18.707
You think?!

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:19.365
Maybe we should just
keep it simple.

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.672
Maybe we should just
keep it simple.

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:28.877
This is so not simple.

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:30.179
Yeah, but you know

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:33.380
she triple chain-locks
the front door at night.

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:36.948
A little more,
a little more. Okay.

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:56.943
Where is she?

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:01.508
Maybe she's in her chair.

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:21.800
You caught me.

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:27.035
I can't help but sneak a fag
once in a blue moon.

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:29.475
We...

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:31.479
We thought
that you might be cold,

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:33.708
so we brought you
an extra pillow.

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:37.116
Oh, such consideration.

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:42.055
So unlike the other landlords.

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:47.358
Many have passed
through the dwelling below,

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:53.835
but I just know
you two have come to stay.

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:59.005
Officer Dan put in
me new television.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.236
52 inches.

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:05.110
And he gave me
these noise boxes,

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.479
there and by me chair.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:11.077
So it's like I'm in the cinema.

01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:17.716
Oh, it's going to be
so wonderful here.

01:08:17.792 --> 01:08:21.126
You two lovelies...

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:23.495
me...

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:26.466
Officer Dan.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:32.371
We're going to be
one big, happy family.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.872
The Irish have a saying

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:41.076
that it's unlucky to come in
one door and go out of another.

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:44.176
Something to do with the dead.

01:08:44.252 --> 01:08:47.814
Evil spirits and the like.

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:52.086
Good night now.

01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:06.300
Do you know what, dears?

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:12.676
I think I've enough warmth
as it is.

01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:19.743
Night.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.487
That was, without question,

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.689
the weirdest 7 minutes
of my life.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:41.939
Captain Connelly battled waves
twice the size of that!

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.706
Didn't he, Little Dick?

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:53.912
We're just gonna be one big,
happy family!

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:04.329
What?!
Is it us?!

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:08.200
Are we doing such a bad job
of trying to kill her?!

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:11.637
It's not our fault!
She's a freak of nature!

01:10:17.746 --> 01:10:20.306
Hey! I thought you were supposed
to get rid of these.

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.077
I did!

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:24.176
It's strange.
I don't know how that got there.

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:25.743
Yeah, right.

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:28.289
"Ass Patrol"!

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:30.552
Hand me that "Ass Patrol."

01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:49.810
Now, depending on her mood,

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:52.711
she could be watching TV
over here

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:54.681
or sneaking a cigarette
over there.

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.617
I realize this is
just horribly cluttered.

01:10:57.686 --> 01:11:00.814
When we get in there, we're
gonna go for a cleaner look.

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.447
It's...

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.523
Sorry.

01:11:05.594 --> 01:11:08.256
What's the easiest way
into this hag's place?

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:13.859
Well, we found the dumbwaiter
to be rather effective.

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:17.905
Yeah, and you really don't have
to pull that hard to climb it.

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:21.841
You know, we could even leave
the back door open for you.

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:25.676
So, Chick, how much is this
gonna set us back?

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.079
25K.

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:29.515
O-- 2-- Okay.

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:31.985
'Cause we had had
a slightly different figure

01:11:32.054 --> 01:11:34.648
in our heads.

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:37.988
We were thinking maybe something
a little closer to, like...

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:42.257
half a "K."

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.496
The bottom-line price
for wet work is $25,000.

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.673
Okay.

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:57.773
When do you think
you could do it?

01:11:57.846 --> 01:11:59.473
I'll do it Thursday night.

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:01.106
- Christmas Eve?
- Yeah.

01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:04.016
I got a little function.
Then I'll swing by.

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:06.520
Put the cash in the dumbwaiter.

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:08.681
- Got it?
- Got it.

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:10.850
- Okay.
- Cool.

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:13.053
Don't forget your computer.

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:15.221
Thank you so much.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.129
Good night.

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:29.710
Okay, now all we need
is $25,000.

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:32.747
"Piper grabbed the leash of the
only partner he'd ever known,

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:35.613
and the private eye and his
Jack Russell headed downtown.

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:39.120
'I guess it's just one of those
things worth killing for, huh?"'

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:45.259
We'll take a break
and come back for some Q&A.

01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:46.624
Dental surgery.

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.663
$25,000?!

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:50.756
The thing is,
with Nancy losing her job,

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:54.428
and with the mortgage and now
with me losing my book contract,

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.003
things have gotten desperate,

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:59.370
and I wouldn't even be asking
if it wasn't serious.

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:03.943
Did you get the money?

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:05.570
No. He didn't think
I needed it.

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:09.208
But I did get a nice,
new, signed first edition

01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:10.751
for my collection.

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:13.083
He wrote it in 4 days.
Want to know how?

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:15.589
Listen to this.
Let's see.

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:17.522
"Her hair was bright yellow

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:20.153
like the color of your pee
after you take a multivitamin."

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:22.993
It's a nice metaphor, asshole!

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.226
Stupid, freaking asshole!

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.427
I hate you and your stupid
Don Piper mystery

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:30.699
and your stupid pregnant wife
who's gonna have a little baby

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:34.742
that has a freaking six-pack
because its mother never eats!

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:36.971
Honey.

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:40.982
Honey, we're gonna get
that money.

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:42.778
How?

01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:47.015
How are we gonna get $25,000
in two days?

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:05.264
<i># It's beginning to look</i>

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:07.103
No.

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:11.038
Not Mr. Peacock.

01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:14.980

Merry Christmas!

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:44.637
That's good, kids.
That is good.

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:47.140
Now, you save those voices
for the neighbors, okay?

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:50.269
Officer Dan,
what a pleasant surprise.

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:51.869
What can we do for you?

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:54.507
I have cookies
I want to take to Miss Connelly.

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:58.280
Oh, okay.
Oh, that's nice.

01:15:58.353 --> 01:15:59.513
No.
I'll take them up myself.

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:01.112
I'll bring them up for you.

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:03.123
If you don't mind...

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:09.928
I don't--

01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:12.125
I don't think she's even
up there.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.658
She's not, so you should just
leave it at the door.

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:36.918
Hey!
Cut that out.

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:38.516
Stop it.
Hey!

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:41.256
Stop it!
What the heck is going on?

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:42.763
There are kids here.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:46.427
I knew there was domestic abuse
in this house.

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:48.503
I'm gonna come back
in 10 minutes.

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:50.765
Come on, kids.
Let's go.

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.669
Good save.

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:59.039
I knew they'd send a brute.

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:08.351
Aah!
You shot me!

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:10.857
I've got you, you brute!

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:14.293
Who are ya, bringing a knife
to a gunfight?

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:16.558
Let go of me!

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:24.367
What's he doing?

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.203
He's doing his job.

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:31.837
If you want to dance with me,

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:34.438
you've gotta buy me
a drink first.

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:41.585
Is that smoke?!

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:47.417
Get off me, you crazy bitch!

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:44.681
Wait, wait.

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:47.085
What?
What?

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:53.921
Here we go.
You all right?

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:56.054
Yeah.
Where's Little Dickey?

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:57.758
Dickey, Dickey.
Here you go.

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.562
Here, here.

01:18:59.634 --> 01:19:00.692
Oh, Dick.

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:03.828
Dickey.

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:05.770
Hello.

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.940
Never thought you had it in you.

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:11.979
Thank God I bought
that fire extinguisher.

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:14.106
We were just
trying to help her out.

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:15.649
Her and Little Dickey.

01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:18.083
I'll just write this citation up
for electricity.

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:19.814
Thank you.
Thanks.

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:20.344
Thank you.
Thanks.

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:33.662
Believe it or not,
I need two more autographs,

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:35.600
and that will be it.

01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:38.036
- So how's the new place?
- It's cute.

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:41.439
I'll tell you, the Bronx
is an up-and-coming borough.

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:44.308
You didn't lie, Kenneth.
It all looks incredible.

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:47.075
I told you they'd fix it up,
didn't I?

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:49.208
Friedmans, meet Alex and Nancy.

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:50.216
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:51.843
We can't thank you enough.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.219
This is just a dream house.
It's so quiet.

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:57.417
Honey, won't this be perfect
for your sleep disorder?

01:19:57.492 --> 01:19:59.153
I'm drowsy already.

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:01.024
Hey, who wants to run upstairs
and say hello?

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.723
Well, we should get going.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:04.959
We should.
We have to...

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:05.658
Yeah.

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:07.326
Nonsense!

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:09.562
You pulled the woman
out of a burning building.

01:20:09.671 --> 01:20:12.333
You'd break her heart
if you didn't say goodbye.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.930
Come on!

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:17.239
Mrs. Connelly,
I brought you a surprise!

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:20.509
Mrs. Connelly!!

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:22.447
The hearing on this one.

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:25.816
Look who's here.
She's asleep.

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:27.514
Sweetheart.

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:33.087
She's stiff as a board.

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:36.756
No.
She's just hard-of-hearing.

01:20:37.632 --> 01:20:39.623
Mrs. Connelly!

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.643
She's dead.

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:51.109
Oh, poor thing.

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:52.976
No.

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:54.948
She can't be dead.

01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:57.678
I guess it was just her time.

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:01.681
Come on, I'll call
the Friedmans.

01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:04.020
You don't have to stay here
for this.

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:06.390
Come.
Come, come, come.

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:11.889
Must have been
all the excitement.

01:21:33.755 --> 01:21:35.848
I can't believe it.

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:38.688
She was so full of life.

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:43.320
I mean, for all our differences,

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:47.630
that old lady really had
a lot of spunk.

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.829
A lot of it.

01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:53.464
Do you think she's up in heaven?

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:56.609
Well, I'll tell you something.

01:21:56.678 --> 01:22:00.876
Wherever she is,
she's in a better place.

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:12.517
You should have seen their faces
when I said she was a goner.

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:15.529
So cheap, though I wish
I could have been there.

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:16.359
Trust me.

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:19.798
It wasn't easy holding
me breath all that long.

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:23.326
Next time, I want a bigger cut
of your commission, Kenny.

01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:25.963
What are you talking about?
We give you everything, Ma.

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:27.405
There's barely enough left

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:30.876
for Danny and I to have
a cruise to the Caribbean.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:34.211
I'm the one putting
me caboose on the line.

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:34.873
Oh, come on.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.713
You had it easy
with Alex and Nancy.

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:40.721
They were a nice couple.
I do hope they'll be all right.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.017
Ah, they'll be fine.

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:44.558
He's a writer.
They thrive on adversity.

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:48.494
I hope his next book is better
than his last one.

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:52.659
Maybe this time he'll write
about something he knows.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.995
<i>Alex and Nancy's dream house</i>

01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:59.232
<i>may have been</i>
<i>too good to be true.</i>

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:02.105
<i>But did they live</i>
<i>happily ever after?</i>

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:05.203
<i>Well, read the book.</i>

01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:39.307
