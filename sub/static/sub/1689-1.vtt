WEBVTT

00:35.381 --> 00:37.007
Dominic Toretto.

00:38.134 --> 00:41.887
You are hereby sentenced to serve
25 years to life

00:42.180 --> 00:45.578
at the Lompoc Maximum Security Prison system

00:45.613 --> 00:48.977
without the possibility of early parole.

02:03.553 --> 02:04.601
Here's what we know so far.

02:04.636 --> 02:08.223
This is all the aftermath of a daring,
daylight breakout.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.357
There were 26 high-risk inmates
being transferred...

02:10.392 --> 02:13.061
A daring midday breakout where everyone
onboard has been accounted for,

02:13.096 --> 02:14.820
except for one, Dominic Toretto.

02:14.855 --> 02:15.904
Police have just released the identity

02:15.939 --> 02:18.483
of the man they believe to have orchestrated
the shocking escape

02:18.518 --> 02:21.236
that amazingly resulted in no
fatalities this afternoon.

02:21.271 --> 02:24.162
He is former federal agent, Brian O'Conner.

02:24.197 --> 02:27.179
A fierce manhunt is underway
for three fugitives tonight.

02:27.214 --> 02:30.162
Multiple federal and local agencies
have joined forces

02:30.197 --> 02:31.795
in the search for Dominic Toretto

02:31.830 --> 02:34.874
and his accomplices Brian O'Conner
and Mia Toretto.

02:34.909 --> 02:38.270
But despite every eye in the country
looking for them

02:38.305 --> 02:41.631
where Toretto and O'Conner
are now is anyone's guess.

03:58.209 --> 03:59.751
It's got to be it, right?

04:24.026 --> 04:25.910
Let's get out of here.
Whoa, whoa.

04:26.362 --> 04:27.529
Easy, friends.

04:27.564 --> 04:28.697
She's with me.

04:30.533 --> 04:32.284
Mia.

04:33.244 --> 04:34.870
Vince.

04:39.542 --> 04:40.542
Buster.

04:42.545 --> 04:44.045
Come on.

04:45.715 --> 04:46.965
Dom here yet?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.265
No.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.016
When was the last time you heard from him?

04:50.051 --> 04:53.221
A couple of weeks ago.
Up in Ecuador somewhere.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.809
How does it feel? What's that?

04:59.395 --> 05:01.730
To be on the other side of a wanted poster?

05:03.941 --> 05:04.983
He will show up.

05:05.018 --> 05:06.276
Yeah.

05:12.492 --> 05:13.492
Dom's?

05:15.244 --> 05:16.286
Yeah.

05:19.790 --> 05:20.874
Time for bed little one.

05:20.909 --> 05:22.501
Can I bring him?

05:22.536 --> 05:24.544
Of course.

05:24.579 --> 05:25.629
Aw.

05:27.757 --> 05:28.924
Good night.

05:46.943 --> 05:48.610
Excuse me, sorry.

05:54.617 --> 05:56.368
Why Rio, Vince?

05:58.829 --> 06:02.791
You mean after
you screwed everything up in LA?

06:05.127 --> 06:08.046
Ended up free-falling through
South America, you know,

06:08.081 --> 06:11.442
hitting every hellhole on the way down.

06:11.477 --> 06:14.803
Would have kept on going if not for Rosa.

06:32.488 --> 06:33.488
Does he know?

06:45.710 --> 06:47.127
So, listen.

06:48.129 --> 06:50.387
There is a job coming up.

06:50.422 --> 06:52.389
I was hoping Dom was going to be here by now

06:52.424 --> 06:56.011
but this one is clean enough
we can do it without him.

06:56.804 --> 07:01.308
It's a good gig.
Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.

07:02.351 --> 07:05.353
Guy I know is putting together
a team to swipe them.

07:05.388 --> 07:07.731
Just need a few more willing bodies.

07:07.766 --> 07:09.573
I don't know.

07:09.608 --> 07:12.506
Look, the way the car scene is down here

07:12.541 --> 07:15.405
we can unload them quick and get top dollar.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.497
It's easy money.

07:17.532 --> 07:19.868
And from where I am sitting,

07:20.620 --> 07:24.122
it looks like you both could use the payday.

08:03.829 --> 08:04.829
What are you reading?

08:05.665 --> 08:06.790
Travel guide.

08:07.375 --> 08:08.416
Yeah?

08:12.338 --> 08:13.797
Tokyo.

08:15.341 --> 08:16.633
Moscow.

08:20.179 --> 08:21.144
Goa.

08:21.179 --> 08:22.931
You want to know what all of these
places have in common?

08:23.265 --> 08:24.265
Huh?

08:25.101 --> 08:26.601
No extradition.

08:41.158 --> 08:43.076
Here we go.

08:59.468 --> 09:01.344
Excuse me, buddy.

09:15.735 --> 09:17.235
Okay.

09:40.593 --> 09:42.177
Hey, we have found them.

09:42.386 --> 09:44.012
Yeah, second-to-the-last freighter.

09:54.607 --> 09:55.989
What is it?

09:56.024 --> 09:59.736
DEA tags. These cars have been seized.

10:41.403 --> 10:42.695
Look who showed up.

10:43.572 --> 10:46.282
God, I am so happy you're okay.

10:49.411 --> 10:50.752
I thought I told you to lay low.

10:50.787 --> 10:53.414
Been running on fumes. Had to make a call.

10:53.874 --> 10:56.793
Hey. Quit talking.
We only got the two-minute window.

10:57.419 --> 10:59.254
Let's go, Vince.

11:01.799 --> 11:02.841
I am taking the GT40.

11:39.795 --> 11:40.962
Ladies first.

11:47.136 --> 11:48.136
Hey.

11:49.722 --> 11:50.722
Hey.

11:51.891 --> 11:52.932
This car suits me better.

12:00.482 --> 12:02.275
See you, baby.

12:08.657 --> 12:10.408
It's okay...
we're all going to the same place.

12:10.443 --> 12:12.243
We will get the car there.

12:17.750 --> 12:20.585
Change of plans. Wait for my call.

12:24.048 --> 12:25.089
Let's go.

12:42.524 --> 12:43.566
Where is she going?

12:45.235 --> 12:47.028
Where is she going? Hey.

12:48.530 --> 12:49.614
Hey.

12:54.244 --> 12:57.664
We're being robbed. Whatever
happens, don't stop the train.

12:58.874 --> 12:59.958
Go after the girl.

13:00.668 --> 13:01.668
Hurry up.

13:31.699 --> 13:34.283
Access card. Get the access card.

14:47.066 --> 14:48.149
Shit.

15:13.008 --> 15:15.134
Bridge. There is a bridge.

15:30.359 --> 15:31.818
Luggage car is clear.

15:38.492 --> 15:39.867
Freeze.

16:39.887 --> 16:41.262
Oh, shit.

17:11.877 --> 17:13.794
You had to make a call, huh?

17:14.378 --> 17:16.589
Shitty call, O'Conner.

17:16.964 --> 17:18.715
Shitty call.

17:38.654 --> 17:41.364
You two stirred up quite a
bit of trouble today.

17:42.574 --> 17:44.540
Three of my men dead.

17:44.575 --> 17:47.036
Three DEA agents along with them.

17:47.621 --> 17:49.935
Of course, this is business

17:49.970 --> 17:52.250
and sometimes things go astray.

17:53.418 --> 17:55.676
All I care about is the car.

17:55.711 --> 17:58.047
Tell me where it is,
and I will let you go.

18:00.842 --> 18:03.928
This roofing plastic says you're
full of shit.

18:05.097 --> 18:08.474
I don't know how you guys do business
in your part of the world,

18:08.509 --> 18:09.600
but here in Rio,

18:10.227 --> 18:13.312
I like it when all parties
know what they're up against.

18:13.347 --> 18:14.820
That's funny.

18:14.855 --> 18:17.483
Because it goes both ways.

18:19.319 --> 18:20.319
You know,

18:23.407 --> 18:25.992
I hear your sister is very beautiful.

18:28.078 --> 18:29.870
Wherever she hides

18:31.248 --> 18:32.540
I will find her.

19:18.295 --> 19:23.341
The American fugitives killed three DEA
agents during a train robbery...

19:23.376 --> 19:26.309
...police warn they are armed
and extremely dangerous.

19:26.344 --> 19:29.847
Anyone with information should contact
law enforcement immediately...

19:40.734 --> 19:42.193
Mia?

19:43.111 --> 19:44.111
Hey.

19:46.907 --> 19:48.164
You okay?

19:48.199 --> 19:50.201
Yeah, you all right?

19:52.746 --> 19:53.788
Hey.

19:59.503 --> 20:01.420
Hey, yeah.

20:02.672 --> 20:03.964
Just like a Toretto.

20:06.009 --> 20:07.009
Where's Vince?

20:07.677 --> 20:08.928
That's a good question.

20:10.389 --> 20:11.937
He will be here.

20:11.972 --> 20:13.147
Guys, we're all over the news.

20:13.182 --> 20:16.644
They're blaming us for the killing
of those DEA agents on the train.

20:16.679 --> 20:19.737
Which means we just jumped
to the top of the wanted list.

20:19.772 --> 20:22.400
The feds have got to show everyone
their agents are off limits

20:22.943 --> 20:25.277
and they're going to send their best
guys. We got to get out of here.

20:25.612 --> 20:28.614
One thing we know for sure

20:30.075 --> 20:31.700
is that they wanted this car.

20:33.537 --> 20:34.585
Because something is in it.

20:34.620 --> 20:38.374
If we find out what it is, we will
know what we're up against.

20:55.725 --> 20:58.582
All right, listen up. The men
we're after are professional runners.

20:58.617 --> 21:01.439
They like speed and are guaranteed to
go down the hardest possible way

21:01.474 --> 21:02.863
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

21:02.898 --> 21:06.673
We find them, we take them as a
team, and we bring them back.

21:06.708 --> 21:09.912
And above all else, we don't ever,
ever let them get into cars.

21:09.947 --> 21:13.117
Crime scene is 10 hours old and
counting, men. Let's go hunting.

21:16.580 --> 21:19.373
Agente Hobbs.
Chief of Police, Joao Alemeida.

21:19.408 --> 21:20.624
Luke.

21:21.209 --> 21:23.884
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

21:23.919 --> 21:26.046
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

21:26.081 --> 21:27.638
Let me tell you something about these two men.

21:27.673 --> 21:30.259
One is a former federal officer, been
in deep cover for five years.

21:30.294 --> 21:32.143
He knows every way
you're going to come for him.

21:32.178 --> 21:35.347
The other one is a professional
criminal, escaped prison twice,

21:35.382 --> 21:38.138
spent half his life on the
run avoiding folks like you.

21:38.173 --> 21:40.895
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS...

21:40.930 --> 21:42.987
Two things. One, I need a translator.

21:43.022 --> 21:44.607
We have plenty in the
public relations department.

21:44.642 --> 21:46.484
Elena Neves.

21:48.069 --> 21:49.445
A patrol officer? You heard me.

21:50.238 --> 21:52.406
But why? We have many more experienced people.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.457
I like her smile.

21:54.492 --> 21:56.494
What's the second thing?

21:57.746 --> 22:00.456
Stay the fuck out of my way.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.343
Brian. Hm?

22:13.803 --> 22:15.221
I have something I have to tell you.

22:15.256 --> 22:16.972
God damn.

22:17.766 --> 22:18.849
What a mess.

22:20.644 --> 22:22.311
Where you been, man?

22:25.065 --> 22:26.906
You better check that tone.

22:26.941 --> 22:28.859
And you just better answer the goddamn question.

22:28.894 --> 22:30.444
Stop it. Both of you.

22:33.865 --> 22:34.907
Where were you, Vince?

22:36.201 --> 22:39.084
Guys all over the favelas asking about you.

22:39.119 --> 22:41.830
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.

22:41.865 --> 22:43.328
Had to wait them out.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.757
That is such horseshit.

22:44.792 --> 22:46.961
That was your job,
and those were your guys. Hey.

22:46.996 --> 22:48.594
Hey. Enough, O'Conner.

22:48.629 --> 22:50.506
If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

22:50.541 --> 22:51.674
Go walk it off.

23:06.815 --> 23:10.359
Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries

23:10.694 --> 23:14.446
but, quite frankly, your business
methods are too violent.

23:15.532 --> 23:17.783
Let me tell you a true story.

23:17.993 --> 23:22.288
Five hundred years ago, the Portuguese
and the Spanish came here,

23:22.323 --> 23:25.833
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

23:28.086 --> 23:32.548
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.

23:34.884 --> 23:38.178
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

23:40.056 --> 23:44.018
Personally,
I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

23:45.687 --> 23:47.667
They came bearing gifts.

23:47.702 --> 23:49.648
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

23:50.525 --> 23:54.159
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

23:54.194 --> 23:57.531
but to continue receiving them, they
had to work for the Portuguese.

23:58.700 --> 24:02.077
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.

24:02.912 --> 24:06.624
Now, if you dominate the people with violence,

24:07.542 --> 24:10.961
they will eventually fight back because
they have nothing to lose.

24:11.588 --> 24:13.637
And that's the key.

24:13.672 --> 24:17.551
I go into the favelas and give them
something to lose.

24:18.553 --> 24:20.575
Electricity, running water,

24:20.610 --> 24:22.598
school rooms for their kids.

24:24.184 --> 24:27.061
And for that taste of a better life,

24:28.605 --> 24:30.564
I own them.

24:31.733 --> 24:32.775
Gentlemen.

24:37.447 --> 24:38.614
I apologize for the interruption.

24:39.157 --> 24:41.700
Senor Reyes, may I speak with you?

24:41.735 --> 24:44.286
We have found them.

24:45.747 --> 24:47.956
Pardon me, gentlemen.

25:02.931 --> 25:05.099
Almost wish I didn't see that.

25:08.436 --> 25:10.458
Almost.

25:10.493 --> 25:12.481
Wait, Dom.

25:13.108 --> 25:14.733
Mia was on that train.

25:14.768 --> 25:16.443
My sister.

25:17.153 --> 25:19.697
I didn't know.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

25:19.732 --> 25:22.116
You set up the deal.

25:22.575 --> 25:24.827
I thought the job was for the cars.

25:25.286 --> 25:27.002
I didn't know.

25:27.037 --> 25:28.580
All they want is the chip.

25:30.583 --> 25:32.292
Damn.

25:32.961 --> 25:34.608
You should have come clean.

25:34.643 --> 25:36.255
What's going on out here?

25:36.965 --> 25:38.305
Nothing.

25:38.340 --> 25:41.885
Please, Dom, just let me have the
chip. I can take this to them.

25:42.137 --> 25:44.138
They will give it to
Reyes and set things right.

25:45.140 --> 25:46.223
Get out.

25:49.477 --> 25:50.853
What?

25:50.888 --> 25:52.229
Get out.

25:59.821 --> 26:02.371
You never listen to me.

26:02.406 --> 26:06.160
Not when I told you he was a cop,
and not now.

26:07.162 --> 26:10.956
You never trust me and
look where it's gotten us.

26:11.583 --> 26:13.333
Look at our family now.

26:13.835 --> 26:18.464
I can't go home.
Your sister is stuck in this life.

26:19.340 --> 26:20.507
Where's Letty, Dom?

26:23.011 --> 26:24.011
Where's Letty?

26:48.495 --> 26:49.918
Plasma cutter.

26:49.953 --> 26:53.290
Wilkes, I want a list of every
place within 50 miles

26:53.325 --> 26:55.125
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.336
Pass me that manifest.

27:03.968 --> 27:06.011
Officer Neves. Been waiting for you.

27:06.304 --> 27:08.472
You asked for me? I did.

27:08.723 --> 27:10.224
May I ask why?

27:11.309 --> 27:12.726
My smile is not that great.

27:16.231 --> 27:18.857
Your husband was an officer who
was gunned down in the favela.

27:18.892 --> 27:20.818
Six months later,
you upped and joined the force.

27:20.853 --> 27:22.152
You're motivated.

27:23.029 --> 27:25.989
Plus, I figure you're the only one
in Rio who can't be bought.

27:26.024 --> 27:27.491
Am I right?

27:28.785 --> 27:30.473
Yes. Of course I am.

27:30.508 --> 27:32.127
Good news, bad news.

27:32.162 --> 27:33.879
You know I like my dessert first.

27:33.914 --> 27:35.923
Back-checked the rail line like you asked.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.043
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

27:38.378 --> 27:39.802
One set of tracks headed west

27:39.837 --> 27:42.589
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.

27:42.624 --> 27:43.931
But another set of tracks headed east.

27:43.966 --> 27:46.426
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

27:46.886 --> 27:49.096
The GT40 that was missing from the manifest.

27:49.131 --> 27:50.764
Followed the trail a couple of miles.

27:50.799 --> 27:52.057
Pretty easy in this scrub.

27:52.350 --> 27:53.892
Can't move without leaving a sign.

27:53.927 --> 27:55.400
Give me the damn veggies.

27:55.435 --> 27:58.814
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.

28:00.149 --> 28:01.650
Not necessarily.

28:02.151 --> 28:04.862
That road heads up through the
hills into the favelas.

28:04.897 --> 28:07.573
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

28:07.949 --> 28:09.998
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

28:10.033 --> 28:13.287
If they headed that way, we will
pick up their tracks there.

28:13.322 --> 28:15.243
You come prepared.

28:15.278 --> 28:17.165
I am motivated.

28:17.876 --> 28:18.917
All right, then.

28:19.627 --> 28:21.712
Let's find ourselves a car.

28:52.327 --> 28:53.333
What do you think?

28:53.368 --> 28:55.871
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

28:56.456 --> 28:59.583
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.

28:59.618 --> 29:01.501
Let's check this one.

29:06.215 --> 29:07.598
Look at that.

29:07.633 --> 29:10.135
Same building, same order every week.

29:10.170 --> 29:12.054
It's a delivery schedule.

29:33.201 --> 29:34.201
What's this?

29:35.620 --> 29:36.585
Drugs?

29:36.620 --> 29:39.588
No. That's a dealer pack.

29:39.623 --> 29:41.625
See, most major players,
they weigh their money

29:41.660 --> 29:43.585
so they don't have to constantly count it.

29:43.620 --> 29:44.968
Right there, that's 49 kilos.

29:45.003 --> 29:47.047
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

29:47.715 --> 29:50.217
You're saying each one of these shipments
is worth 10 million dollars?

29:50.252 --> 29:51.343
Yeah.

30:14.367 --> 30:16.243
I thought so.

30:18.663 --> 30:20.253
So what is that?

30:20.288 --> 30:22.624
A 100-million plus in cash houses?

30:22.659 --> 30:24.960
That's how he keeps it off the grid.

30:27.588 --> 30:30.257
I think it's safe to say that Reyes
is smart to want this back.

30:30.292 --> 30:32.926
It's his whole network right there,
just laid out on a chip.

30:56.451 --> 30:57.784
Wilkes, Fusco, up the middle.

30:57.819 --> 30:59.536
Mac, Chato, flank north.

30:59.571 --> 31:00.971
What about me?

31:01.006 --> 31:02.372
Stay here.

31:12.633 --> 31:13.640
Go that way.

31:13.675 --> 31:15.135
The other two went over the wall.

31:58.513 --> 31:59.596
Come on, go. Go.

32:57.864 --> 32:59.531
Get on the ground.

33:00.366 --> 33:02.617
I got Toretto. Four blocks north of your...

33:08.124 --> 33:09.916
They already know who you are.

33:41.908 --> 33:43.325
Let's go.

34:28.788 --> 34:30.170
You okay here?

34:30.205 --> 34:33.958
Yeah. I am good. Thank you.

35:08.703 --> 35:11.496
They're going to be looking for
the three of us together now.

35:11.531 --> 35:14.256
We need to split up.

35:14.291 --> 35:17.210
You and Mia head south,
I will lead them away.

35:17.245 --> 35:18.295
No.

35:19.130 --> 35:20.637
Dom is right.

35:20.672 --> 35:22.465
Look how lucky we just got.
What happens next time?

35:22.500 --> 35:23.591
We have no choice but to split up.

35:23.626 --> 35:24.926
I am pregnant.

35:29.765 --> 35:31.266
I already lost my family once.

35:33.352 --> 35:35.895
I am not going through that again.

35:36.355 --> 35:38.565
Are you kidding me? No.

35:43.821 --> 35:46.448
I am not going anywhere. Okay?

35:48.826 --> 35:49.909
Dom?

35:50.911 --> 35:52.954
Promise me we stick together.

36:00.713 --> 36:02.589
I promise.

36:07.178 --> 36:09.637
Our family just got bigger.

36:27.740 --> 36:29.491
Something doesn't add up.

36:29.950 --> 36:31.451
Toretto and O'Conner.

36:31.952 --> 36:36.539
They stay when they're supposed to run,
they steal gas then give it away?

36:36.574 --> 36:38.249
Now they're killing federal agents?

36:39.585 --> 36:41.253
It doesn't make any sense.

36:41.288 --> 36:42.921
Here's what makes sense.

36:47.593 --> 36:49.177
All these guys are is names on a list.

36:49.212 --> 36:50.643
They come up, we take them down.

36:50.678 --> 36:53.264
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

36:53.299 --> 36:55.058
Wilkes, we get anything?

36:55.434 --> 36:56.775
Standard forensics.

36:56.810 --> 36:58.353
Shoe prints. Hair and fiber.

36:58.388 --> 36:59.896
Prints are all over the car.

36:59.931 --> 37:01.029
Anything else?

37:01.064 --> 37:03.024
Yeah,
we tracked the owner off the vehicle ID.

37:03.059 --> 37:05.294
There are a couple of shell
companies in between,

37:05.329 --> 37:07.805
but we finally traced it back
to a corporation

37:07.840 --> 37:10.281
owned by an investor
down here named Hernan Reyes.

37:10.316 --> 37:11.366
Investor?

37:12.576 --> 37:15.829
If there's anything illegal happening
in Rio, Reyes is involved.

37:15.864 --> 37:17.504
Okay, then so are we.

37:17.539 --> 37:19.833
If he could get us any closer to our
guys, I want everything on him.

37:19.868 --> 37:21.216
Chato, you're on the roof.

37:21.251 --> 37:23.628
I want you on overwatch in case somebody
comes back for something.

37:23.663 --> 37:26.054
Mac, give me a cross-check on Reyes,
full specs.

37:26.089 --> 37:28.383
If he goes to the john, I want to know
how many times he shakes it.

37:28.418 --> 37:30.844
You got it, boss. Wilkes, Fusco.

37:31.554 --> 37:33.430
Let's put all this mess back together.

37:35.808 --> 37:37.309
That's going to take a while.

37:37.344 --> 37:38.810
Then you better get started.

37:39.228 --> 37:40.777
They were taking this car apart for a reason.

37:40.812 --> 37:42.689
Let's put it back together
and find out what's missing.

38:10.384 --> 38:13.720
Hey, Dom,
what do you remember about your father?

38:16.182 --> 38:17.891
My father.

38:22.062 --> 38:24.314
He used to...

38:24.982 --> 38:28.359
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.

38:29.028 --> 38:31.404
For anybody in the neighborhood.

38:32.323 --> 38:34.699
If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.

38:36.535 --> 38:40.295
Every single day he was in the
shop, and every single night,

38:40.330 --> 38:45.418
he was at the kitchen table with Mia,
helping her with her homework.

38:46.837 --> 38:49.714
Even after she went to sleep,

38:49.749 --> 38:52.557
he'd stay up for a few more hours

38:52.592 --> 38:56.638
so he could learn the next chapter
and help her the next day.

38:57.890 --> 38:59.599
I remember everything about my father.

39:01.185 --> 39:02.477
Everything.

39:03.604 --> 39:04.938
That's just it.

39:05.314 --> 39:06.814
I don't remember shit about my dad.

39:10.528 --> 39:12.029
I don't remember him yelling.

39:12.064 --> 39:13.530
I don't remember him smiling.

39:15.574 --> 39:18.117
To be honest with you, I don't even
remember what the hell he looked like.

39:20.287 --> 39:22.413
I don't remember. He just...

39:24.250 --> 39:25.625
He was just never there.

39:27.836 --> 39:29.963
You ain't going to be like that, Brian.

39:46.605 --> 39:48.731
We can't keep running, Dom.

39:50.401 --> 39:52.214
We got to get out.

39:52.249 --> 39:54.028
We got to get out now.

39:55.239 --> 39:56.573
You're right.

40:08.168 --> 40:09.836
Here's how we're going to do it.

40:14.049 --> 40:15.258
We're going to use this.

40:16.427 --> 40:18.261
We're going do one last job.

40:18.762 --> 40:21.055
We're going to take all of Reyes' money.

40:21.348 --> 40:22.932
Every dime of it,

40:23.851 --> 40:25.518
and disappear.

40:29.148 --> 40:30.148
Forever.

40:31.692 --> 40:32.824
New passports.

40:32.859 --> 40:35.361
New lives with no more
looking over our shoulder.

40:35.396 --> 40:37.113
And we're just going to buy our freedom.

40:37.148 --> 40:38.204
That's right.

40:38.239 --> 40:39.907
You realize we're talking
about going up against

40:39.942 --> 40:41.326
the most powerful guy in all of Rio?

40:41.619 --> 40:43.077
Yes, we are.

40:44.496 --> 40:46.414
Then we're going to need a team.

40:53.005 --> 40:55.381
Let's run through the bases real quick.
Who do we got?

40:55.416 --> 40:56.841
First we're going to need a chameleon.

40:58.344 --> 41:02.221
Someone who can blend in anywhere.

41:03.265 --> 41:04.328
What else?

41:04.363 --> 41:05.391
A fast talker.

41:06.310 --> 41:08.811
Someone who can bullshit their
way out of anything.

41:09.229 --> 41:10.229
I got that.

41:12.066 --> 41:13.615
This guy is going to have
a lot of surveillance.

41:13.650 --> 41:15.443
We're going to need someone
who's good with circuits.

41:17.613 --> 41:20.115
And with those circuits,
Reyes is going to have walls.

41:20.150 --> 41:22.617
We're going to need guys to
punch through those walls.

41:24.578 --> 41:25.620
What else?

41:26.163 --> 41:27.879
Utilities and weapons.

41:27.914 --> 41:30.750
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.

41:31.669 --> 41:33.670
Someone to back up every position.

41:33.705 --> 41:35.296
Yeah, what else do we need?

41:35.331 --> 41:37.006
Most importantly,

41:38.092 --> 41:40.301
we're going to need two precision drivers.

41:40.336 --> 41:43.012
Guys that don't crack under pressure.

41:43.047 --> 41:44.555
Guys that never lose.

41:45.849 --> 41:47.141
You know we got that.

42:15.045 --> 42:17.046
Aw, hell, no.

42:18.006 --> 42:20.717
I see they really scraped the bottom
of the barrel, huh?

42:20.752 --> 42:23.094
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

42:24.847 --> 42:27.890
When are you going to give Martin
Luther King his car back?

42:27.925 --> 42:30.727
As soon as you give Rick
James his jacket back.

42:33.981 --> 42:36.107
What's up, man? What's up?

42:47.369 --> 42:48.369
Hmm.

42:49.121 --> 42:50.851
Sexy legs, baby girl.

42:50.886 --> 42:52.582
What time do they open?

42:53.459 --> 42:57.253
They open the same time
as I pull this trigger.

42:57.796 --> 42:59.255
Want me to open them?

43:02.634 --> 43:05.476
I told you the skinny chick had balls.

43:05.511 --> 43:08.139
Looks like she started the party without us.

43:08.724 --> 43:11.350
Hey, anybody can talk shit in Spanish, homie.

43:11.935 --> 43:14.270
What's this guy saying?

43:14.980 --> 43:16.898
Ugly is still ugly in Spanish or in English.

43:20.194 --> 43:22.278
Who are these clowns, man? Circus clowns.

43:24.406 --> 43:27.408
I thought cockfights were illegal in Brazil.

43:27.443 --> 43:29.577
I see you all have met.

43:31.288 --> 43:33.337
You know when you called me to come to Rio

43:33.372 --> 43:36.292
I assumed it would be for something
more exciting than this.

43:36.327 --> 43:37.341
Look at this guy.

43:37.376 --> 43:39.587
Long time. I missed you, man.

43:39.622 --> 43:41.189
Good to see you.

43:41.224 --> 43:42.722
Brother. What's up?

43:42.757 --> 43:44.842
Yo, check this out. This is Tej.

43:44.877 --> 43:46.695
Best circuit man on the East Coast.

43:46.730 --> 43:48.513
And this is my boy, Roman Pearce.

43:48.847 --> 43:50.828
We go way back, I met this guy in juvie.

43:50.863 --> 43:52.809
I pulled that job with him in Miami.

43:52.844 --> 43:54.310
I have heard about you.

43:55.479 --> 43:56.944
Nice digs.

43:56.979 --> 43:58.856
Yeah, well, the Ritz was sold out.

43:59.399 --> 44:01.115
So what's this all about, Dom?

44:01.150 --> 44:04.570
Yeah, man, why did you drag
us halfmay around the world?

44:04.605 --> 44:06.447
Because we got a job.

44:07.449 --> 44:10.076
All right,
so our target's name is Hernan Reyes.

44:10.111 --> 44:11.834
And he runs the drug scene down here.

44:11.869 --> 44:14.497
He's never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.

44:14.532 --> 44:16.662
No paper trail means no banks.

44:16.697 --> 44:18.758
And no banks means cash houses.

44:18.793 --> 44:21.295
That's right. Ten of them, to be exact.

44:21.330 --> 44:23.513
Spread throughout the city.

44:23.548 --> 44:25.466
And we're going to hit them all.

44:26.927 --> 44:27.927
All of them?

44:28.345 --> 44:29.393
All of them.

44:29.428 --> 44:31.395
That sounds crazy.

44:31.430 --> 44:33.515
You bring us to a whole other country

44:33.550 --> 44:35.601
so we can rob the dude who runs it?

44:36.728 --> 44:38.354
I thought this was business.

44:38.647 --> 44:39.939
Sounds personal to me.

44:40.858 --> 44:42.448
Is that what this is?

44:42.483 --> 44:46.362
I got love for you all,
but personal ain't good business.

44:47.990 --> 44:50.241
I can't do this, homie.

44:51.493 --> 44:55.621
So what we're talking about is $100 million.

44:55.656 --> 44:57.713
You say what?

44:57.748 --> 45:01.425
Hundred...
See, sometimes I be over thinking, man,

45:01.460 --> 45:04.589
and I know we just met, but
you just, kind of, got to...

45:04.624 --> 45:08.426
That's right, $100 million,
and everything we take,

45:08.461 --> 45:09.892
we split even.

45:09.927 --> 45:11.804
That's a little over $11 million apiece.

45:12.806 --> 45:14.181
I am down.

45:14.641 --> 45:15.683
I am in.

45:17.311 --> 45:18.728
Eleven million.

45:19.146 --> 45:21.856
Sounds like a whole lot of
vaginal activity to me.

45:22.316 --> 45:24.609
You can't pull off 10 heists
on the same mark.

45:24.644 --> 45:25.741
You just can't.

45:25.776 --> 45:27.368
As soon as we hit the first one,

45:27.403 --> 45:30.239
they're going to do everything
they can to protect the rest.

45:31.241 --> 45:32.992
Exactly.

46:11.573 --> 46:12.698
Nobody move.

46:27.881 --> 46:29.132
That's all of it.

46:29.167 --> 46:30.348
You a dead man.

46:30.383 --> 46:31.550
You're all dead men.

46:32.386 --> 46:33.886
You don't have a place to hide.

46:36.848 --> 46:38.057
Who's hiding?

46:38.092 --> 46:40.524
Are you crazy?

46:40.559 --> 46:43.521
Do you know whose house this is?
Whose money are you stealing?

46:53.991 --> 46:55.408
We ain't stealing it.

47:04.334 --> 47:07.420
You tell your boss exactly who did this.

47:09.047 --> 47:10.548
Tell him there's more coming.

47:16.221 --> 47:17.221
Voila.

47:18.181 --> 47:19.181
Turn it over.

47:25.355 --> 47:28.566
She's running on all eight.
Checks out fine.

47:31.111 --> 47:33.029
Keep looking.

47:35.073 --> 47:38.617
Boss, if something was missing, we'd know.

48:04.227 --> 48:07.897
It's a goddamn shame putting
bullshit like that on a classic.

48:08.273 --> 48:10.316
You may as well slap neon lights on it.

48:21.578 --> 48:23.544
They took the chip.

48:23.579 --> 48:27.416
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

48:27.451 --> 48:28.883
Address cross-checks against property

48:28.918 --> 48:30.669
owned by one of Hernan Reyes' corporations.

48:30.704 --> 48:31.886
All right, if that's our guys

48:31.921 --> 48:34.590
then whatever was on that chip
led them directly to that house.

48:34.625 --> 48:35.942
It's them, for sure.

48:35.977 --> 48:37.224
How do you know that?

48:37.259 --> 48:41.639
Because no one else in Rio is
stupid enough to rob Reyes.

48:55.362 --> 48:56.410
Explain.

48:56.445 --> 48:58.197
They invaded the Leblon house.

48:58.573 --> 48:59.872
Who invaded?

48:59.907 --> 49:02.368
The men from the train.

49:10.710 --> 49:12.795
How much did they take?

49:12.830 --> 49:14.880
They didn't take anything.

49:14.915 --> 49:18.592
They burned it.

49:18.885 --> 49:20.434
They burned my money?

49:20.469 --> 49:23.681
Yes. And said there's more coming.

49:31.731 --> 49:32.773
Okay...

49:41.408 --> 49:43.409
Then this...

49:45.287 --> 49:46.745
...is what we're going to do.

49:53.295 --> 49:54.920
Clean the houses.

49:55.213 --> 49:59.425
I want that money under lock and key...

50:00.886 --> 50:01.969
...within an hour.

50:02.004 --> 50:04.263
Understand?

50:06.474 --> 50:08.100
Understood.

50:27.078 --> 50:29.496
Number one is on the move, man.

50:43.887 --> 50:45.429
Two is on the move.

51:10.163 --> 51:11.163
I got mine.

51:32.185 --> 51:34.186
I got eyes on Five.

52:00.880 --> 52:04.216
I know you all said they were consolidating
the money somewhere, but,

52:04.551 --> 52:07.428
you all ain't going to believe this.

52:17.147 --> 52:19.606
Well, this job just got a lot harder.

52:20.275 --> 52:22.464
If he's moving it into a police station

52:22.499 --> 52:24.653
he's got some serious brass in his pocket.

52:25.822 --> 52:27.323
Looks like this is going to be a
shorter trip than I thought...

52:27.358 --> 52:29.780
Hell, yeah, we can't do this.

52:29.815 --> 52:32.202
"Can't"? You mean, "shouldn't. "

52:33.163 --> 52:35.247
I think this doesn't change a thing.

52:38.335 --> 52:40.669
I say we stick to the plan.

52:40.704 --> 52:42.386
You say what?

52:42.421 --> 52:44.173
This just went from Mission: Impossible

52:44.208 --> 52:46.133
to Mission: In-freaking-sanity.

52:48.345 --> 52:49.560
Whatever, man.

52:49.595 --> 52:53.057
I ain't scared, I am just letting you
all know, going in that building is crazy.

52:53.092 --> 52:54.558
I got this.

52:58.188 --> 52:59.521
What time was the robbery?

52:59.556 --> 53:01.440
Around 11:00.

53:02.984 --> 53:04.193
Here we go.

53:06.363 --> 53:07.863
Enhance it.

53:09.991 --> 53:11.408
Their faces are covered.

53:11.443 --> 53:12.618
Run it through FRS.

53:18.708 --> 53:20.334
Well, hello, you son of a bitch.

53:23.213 --> 53:26.256
Wilkes. Run the photos of known associates
of Toretto and O'Conner

53:26.291 --> 53:29.183
against customs entries into
Brazil in the last two weeks.

53:29.218 --> 53:32.471
Check planes, trains, boats, everything
short of the goddamn space shuttle.

53:38.812 --> 53:41.897
They can change their names but
they can't change their faces.

53:41.932 --> 53:43.732
Something big is going down.

53:45.485 --> 53:46.867
That's a 1970 Charger.

53:46.902 --> 53:49.036
Fusco. Upload these specs into the database.

53:49.071 --> 53:51.448
Have the computer cross-check
it with overhead satellites

53:51.483 --> 53:53.499
every 15 minutes, the van behind it, too.

53:53.534 --> 53:56.370
If these vehicles move in the streets
of Rio, I want to know about it.

54:05.255 --> 54:06.318
Everything okay?

54:06.353 --> 54:07.346
Everything is okay.

54:07.381 --> 54:10.134
Who is this Hobbs? This Federal
Agent running around town?

54:10.385 --> 54:11.385
Some American cowboy.

54:12.137 --> 54:13.137
He's handled.

54:13.388 --> 54:14.847
He killed sixteen of our men.

54:15.557 --> 54:16.730
Handle him better.

54:16.765 --> 54:22.229
Look... He requested a rookie
patrol officer as his assistant.

54:24.983 --> 54:25.983
They won't be a problem.

54:54.971 --> 54:56.889
It's all here? Yes.

54:58.391 --> 55:00.142
What about Toretto and O'Conner?
Where are they?

55:00.602 --> 55:01.602
Nothing yet.

55:02.645 --> 55:04.480
But I have all our officers searching.

55:05.315 --> 55:06.440
Not good enough.

55:07.317 --> 55:08.734
Put a price on their heads.

55:08.769 --> 55:10.319
High enough...

55:10.904 --> 55:13.030
...to get every pair of eyes in
the city searching for them.

55:20.497 --> 55:22.998
The beauty of public offices?

55:25.919 --> 55:26.919
Public records.

55:27.337 --> 55:29.755
This is where he's keeping the money.
The vault in the evidence room.

55:30.840 --> 55:35.177
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's
attention, right here, for a second?

55:35.212 --> 55:38.931
We're talking about breaking
into a police station.

55:38.966 --> 55:40.724
Is anyone listening to those words?

55:40.759 --> 55:42.316
Anybody? Popo?

55:42.351 --> 55:44.373
Five-O. One-time. Pigs.

55:44.408 --> 55:46.361
People we don't like.

55:46.396 --> 55:49.399
You know, police stations are designed
to keep people in, not out.

55:49.434 --> 55:50.776
That's why it's a stealth mission.

55:51.194 --> 55:53.904
We will be in and out before they
even know we were there.

55:53.939 --> 55:55.496
Well, we will need to get eyes in there.

55:55.531 --> 55:58.075
At least to find out the make
and model of that vault.

55:58.326 --> 56:01.662
So the vault and then, so...

56:01.697 --> 56:03.170
It's crazy.

56:03.205 --> 56:06.124
Who's supposed to do all this?

56:14.551 --> 56:16.468
What do you mean?

56:17.679 --> 56:18.685
Why me?

56:18.720 --> 56:20.722
Because you got the biggest mouth.

56:20.757 --> 56:22.808
That's for damn sure.

56:29.524 --> 56:30.524
Ooh.

56:32.318 --> 56:33.867
Hello, beautiful.

56:33.902 --> 56:36.578
Look at those dimples. Sexy, sexy.

56:36.613 --> 56:38.740
Love those glasses.
Where did you get them from?

56:38.775 --> 56:41.243
Are those like Gucci frames or something?

56:41.278 --> 56:42.459
No English?

56:42.494 --> 56:45.372
No, no, no. Damn.

56:45.915 --> 56:46.999
How are you, sir?

56:47.417 --> 56:51.253
Special Agent O'Conner. US Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

56:51.288 --> 56:52.546
It says Caucasian.

56:52.839 --> 56:55.591
That's a tan. You know, a tan?

56:58.511 --> 57:02.556
Look, I am working this case and I got
some evidence here to be held.

57:02.591 --> 57:05.017
But I need to get in and check
your storage facility first.

57:05.052 --> 57:06.066
Nope.

57:06.101 --> 57:09.479
Look, I know you're a true professional,
and I respect you, I promise.

57:09.514 --> 57:11.732
You know, it looks like you
work out a little bit, too.

57:11.767 --> 57:14.276
What do you bench, about 350?

57:14.694 --> 57:15.694
Ah, shit.

57:16.863 --> 57:18.161
Look, I am just trying to do my job, man.

57:18.196 --> 57:21.158
My boss sent me here to just make
sure that everything was safe.

57:21.193 --> 57:22.207
It will be safe.

57:22.242 --> 57:24.411
Let me just come in and take a quick peek.

57:24.446 --> 57:25.460
Nope.

57:25.495 --> 57:28.123
Come on, man. Hook a brother up, please?

57:28.158 --> 57:29.663
Nope. And you're not my brother.

57:29.698 --> 57:31.133
Brother from another mother?

57:31.168 --> 57:34.463
Look. No one enters the facility but
authorized evidence personnel.

57:34.498 --> 57:35.721
Now stop wasting my time.

57:35.756 --> 57:37.049
I am going to call the embassy.

57:37.084 --> 57:38.342
No, no, no. No, we're good.

57:38.676 --> 57:40.802
We don't need to call them.
For what? We're good.

57:40.837 --> 57:43.437
Here, I got the box. We're all good.

57:43.472 --> 57:46.440
I promise you.
Thank you so much for your time.

57:46.475 --> 57:48.769
Swear to God, if you were on
the other side of that glass

57:48.804 --> 57:51.229
I'd bust your damn face in.
Now translate that.

58:09.082 --> 58:12.793
It's done. See, I think I make a better
special agent than you ever did.

58:14.545 --> 58:16.838
Well, that depends on how you define "special. "

58:19.884 --> 58:21.176
Come on, now. Let's see what we got.

58:21.211 --> 58:22.761
Not funny.

58:30.103 --> 58:31.812
All right, come on.

58:36.859 --> 58:38.360
Dawg, you still can't drive.

58:39.987 --> 58:42.989
Now, I see why you're always
getting into accidents.

58:43.024 --> 58:45.154
You can't even drive a
damn remote control car.

58:45.189 --> 58:47.285
I am going to need you to shut up right now.

58:47.320 --> 58:49.138
I am not going to shut up. Shut up.

58:49.173 --> 58:50.956
Strap him in his safety belt, man.

58:54.168 --> 58:55.676
Give me the remote, dawg. Go left.

58:55.711 --> 58:57.921
It looks like something right over
there to the left. What is that?

58:57.956 --> 58:59.005
What is that?

59:00.383 --> 59:01.383
Bingo.

59:02.635 --> 59:04.636
What is that, six-by-six?

59:04.671 --> 59:06.030
Eight-by-twelve.

59:06.065 --> 59:07.354
Seven-by-twelve.

59:07.389 --> 59:10.565
Fitted with 18-inch-thick steel
reinforced walls...

59:10.600 --> 59:14.229
...with a insulated copper core to
protect against thermal lance.

59:14.264 --> 59:17.774
A Class-3 electronic lock with
a surefire Griffin retumbler

59:17.809 --> 59:19.533
and a biometric palm scanner.

59:19.568 --> 59:21.736
Ten tons of top-of-the-line security.

59:21.771 --> 59:23.881
Do I want to know how you know all that?

59:23.916 --> 59:25.912
I had a life before you knew me, O'Conner.

59:25.947 --> 59:27.909
Let's just leave it at that, all right?

59:27.944 --> 59:29.661
She is a beauty, though, man.

59:29.696 --> 59:31.878
A "beauty" as in "good"?

59:31.913 --> 59:34.715
"Beauty" as in, she's going to
start off playing hard to get.

59:34.750 --> 59:39.087
Then, no matter how much I caress her,
no matter how much I love her,

59:39.122 --> 59:42.424
in the end, she still
ain't going to give up that ass.

59:49.015 --> 59:50.515
Two to one says you blow the wrong pipe.

59:50.892 --> 59:52.934
Yo, why you got to be so negative
all the time, man?

59:54.145 --> 59:55.444
I ain't negative.

59:55.479 --> 59:58.356
I am just positive you're going to mess it up.

59:58.733 --> 01:00:01.735
I am telling you, man, you got issues.

01:00:06.532 --> 01:00:10.202
Next time if there's no elevator,
I am not coming.

01:00:10.745 --> 01:00:13.747
You need to learn to relax, loco.

01:00:35.394 --> 01:00:37.437
You better hurry up,
we got less than a minute.

01:00:37.472 --> 01:00:43.485
Why do you always set the timer so short?

01:01:06.926 --> 01:01:08.176
I hope you know where you're going.

01:01:08.211 --> 01:01:11.096
I got this. Relax, man.

01:01:11.131 --> 01:01:11.816
Relax.

01:01:25.319 --> 01:01:26.945
...a police station.

01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:28.738
Relax.

01:01:40.543 --> 01:01:42.377
You used too much explosive. Again.

01:01:43.462 --> 01:01:45.130
Too much, too little...

01:01:45.715 --> 01:01:46.715
It's all the same.

01:01:47.383 --> 01:01:52.220
That's some Buddha shit you learned from
a book in the prison library, isn't it?

01:01:53.389 --> 01:01:54.931
And what you're doing there on the wall...

01:01:54.966 --> 01:01:57.809
You got that from the same book, huh?

01:01:58.311 --> 01:01:59.311
You're so negative, bro.

01:02:26.172 --> 01:02:28.506
Can I have some light?

01:02:31.928 --> 01:02:34.269
Got it. We got it.

01:02:34.304 --> 01:02:36.014
Yeah, we're looking at four cameras.

01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:38.558
Yo, that's some high-end shit, too.

01:02:38.593 --> 01:02:39.684
Marker optics.

01:02:40.227 --> 01:02:42.062
Hundred-degree field-of-view.

01:02:42.355 --> 01:02:43.820
Ten seconds oscillation.

01:02:43.855 --> 01:02:45.906
Yeah, that's a narrow window, man.

01:02:45.941 --> 01:02:47.692
Can't we just tap in and replace the image?

01:02:47.727 --> 01:02:49.795
No, it's hooked into a digital sync.

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:51.863
They would know we were in the system.

01:02:51.898 --> 01:02:53.955
The best we can do is peek.

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:56.660
We're going to need some real
fast cars to get through this.

01:02:56.695 --> 01:02:58.203
Not just fast.

01:02:58.496 --> 01:03:00.476
You got a hard right and a hairpin.

01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:02.457
We're going to need something agile.

01:03:02.492 --> 01:03:04.292
You guys mock up a track.

01:03:04.327 --> 01:03:05.377
O'Conner.

01:03:06.712 --> 01:03:08.129
Let's go get some cars.

01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:10.048
Nice.

01:03:48.921 --> 01:03:51.256
Home sweet home.

01:04:09.191 --> 01:04:10.316
Or that.

01:04:11.193 --> 01:04:13.695
How about that?
All motor, no tuning issues.

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:16.079
I always wanted one of those.

01:04:16.114 --> 01:04:19.784
Held the record on the
Avenida three years running.

01:04:21.203 --> 01:04:22.252
Damn, bro...

01:04:22.287 --> 01:04:24.998
You got a lot of balls to bring
your problems here, Toretto.

01:04:25.374 --> 01:04:28.216
Not to mention a cop.

01:04:28.251 --> 01:04:30.510
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

01:04:30.545 --> 01:04:33.590
Word on the street is a lot of people
are looking for you two.

01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:35.550
What?

01:04:35.885 --> 01:04:37.594
You didn't think we'd recognize you?

01:04:38.971 --> 01:04:40.972
No, we're kind of counting on it.

01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:43.725
That little coupe may
run the streets around here,

01:04:45.227 --> 01:04:49.272
but that monster has never
seen a set of tail lights.

01:04:49.982 --> 01:04:51.316
Ever. Well, she's about to.

01:04:53.402 --> 01:04:54.527
Dominic Toretto's ride in my garage.

01:04:55.613 --> 01:04:59.783
Now that... will be a nice trophy.

01:05:01.535 --> 01:05:04.120
Let's go, legend.

01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:07.270
Car for car.

01:05:07.305 --> 01:05:09.501
Car for car?

01:05:09.877 --> 01:05:11.377
You want it, come and get it.

01:05:16.092 --> 01:05:17.926
Let's see what they got.

01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:25.558
Really?

01:05:27.228 --> 01:05:30.334
Where did you get that from? Papa Smurf?

01:05:30.369 --> 01:05:33.441
Okay, O'Conner, give it your best shot.

01:05:56.507 --> 01:05:57.549
How was that one?

01:05:57.584 --> 01:05:58.591
Camera caught you.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.101
What? Yeah, it still caught you.

01:06:01.136 --> 01:06:03.179
Man, I was milking the hell
out of that thing, too.

01:06:03.889 --> 01:06:05.682
We're going to need a faster car.

01:06:10.271 --> 01:06:12.021
I want my money. Come on, man.

01:06:15.734 --> 01:06:16.734
Yeah.

01:06:19.363 --> 01:06:21.239
Let's get it. Watch this.

01:06:27.913 --> 01:06:31.457
That's exactly why your
ass ain't been driving.

01:06:43.012 --> 01:06:44.679
I think I am in love.

01:06:48.475 --> 01:06:49.941
That was real solid work.

01:06:49.976 --> 01:06:53.521
I think Camera 3 still caught you, though.

01:06:53.556 --> 01:06:54.814
Let's do it again.

01:07:02.323 --> 01:07:04.282
That's the piggy bank you ordered.

01:07:04.317 --> 01:07:06.284
You're kidding me. Yep.

01:07:08.162 --> 01:07:10.955
Where in the hell
did you all get one of these?

01:07:11.665 --> 01:07:13.458
Well, we had a life before you met us.

01:07:14.793 --> 01:07:18.129
All right, I will get to work
on the electronic tumbler

01:07:18.164 --> 01:07:20.381
but there's still another problem.

01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:22.348
Palm scanner.

01:07:22.383 --> 01:07:24.260
And without Reyes' handprint,

01:07:24.595 --> 01:07:26.700
Houdini himself couldn't open this bitch.

01:07:26.735 --> 01:07:28.806
How do you know it's Reyes' handprint?

01:07:28.841 --> 01:07:30.607
You got $100 million in a safe.

01:07:30.642 --> 01:07:32.435
You going to put somebody
else's handprint on it?

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.521
Now there you
go with that negativity, man.

01:07:35.556 --> 01:07:36.940
That shit is eating you alive.

01:07:36.975 --> 01:07:38.239
You check that.

01:07:38.274 --> 01:07:40.366
Yo, check that. Shut up.

01:07:40.401 --> 01:07:42.570
How are we supposed to get Reyes' handprint?

01:07:43.864 --> 01:07:45.371
Han.

01:07:45.406 --> 01:07:46.491
You're up.

01:07:48.494 --> 01:07:51.329
Sure. Nothing like the easy stuff.

01:07:52.164 --> 01:07:53.915
Let's go. I will drive.

01:08:12.351 --> 01:08:14.352
I make six bodyguards. Seven.

01:08:15.187 --> 01:08:18.314
You think that guy with a
fanny pack is a tourist?

01:08:23.362 --> 01:08:25.787
So, how long were you in the army?

01:08:25.822 --> 01:08:28.700
That gun you pulled the other
day was a Jericho 941.

01:08:30.035 --> 01:08:31.870
Thumb-racking the slide?

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:33.705
That was straight-up Mossad.

01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:36.832
I got out of the military

01:08:38.042 --> 01:08:41.004
probably the same time you quit smoking.

01:08:41.038 --> 01:08:43.046
The amount of chips you eat,

01:08:43.506 --> 01:08:46.591
the way you always have to keep
your hands and mouth busy,

01:08:46.627 --> 01:08:49.261
you were a two-pack-a-day man for sure.

01:08:51.348 --> 01:08:52.974
Unfiltered.

01:08:56.645 --> 01:08:58.062
Well, this is a bust.

01:08:59.231 --> 01:09:02.484
We're not going to be able to
get his fingerprints out here.

01:09:02.519 --> 01:09:05.737
We need to do some more recon,
call in a couple of extra guys.

01:09:05.772 --> 01:09:06.237
Or

01:09:07.488 --> 01:09:09.698
you don't send a man to do a woman's job.

01:10:07.966 --> 01:10:10.718
We're going to figure this out,
I promise you.

01:10:14.014 --> 01:10:15.306
What's up?

01:10:15.933 --> 01:10:18.476
I thought you were more of a thong man.

01:10:18.511 --> 01:10:19.894
We got the print.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.772
Where?

01:10:24.775 --> 01:10:26.734
Okay, that's crazy.

01:10:28.445 --> 01:10:32.949
So, did he just slap that ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?

01:10:35.494 --> 01:10:37.578
Hey, this will work.

01:10:38.205 --> 01:10:39.873
I am impressed.

01:10:39.908 --> 01:10:41.506
Got it?
Got it.

01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:43.334
But you still didn't answer the question.

01:10:49.341 --> 01:10:51.759
Oh, no. Guys, guys.
Guys, we have a problem.

01:10:51.794 --> 01:10:54.095
The whole team just got burnt.

01:10:55.514 --> 01:10:57.348
Now we're all wanted.

01:10:59.518 --> 01:11:00.483
How did this happen?

01:11:00.518 --> 01:11:04.272
US Diplomatic Security Service
issued the warrants.

01:11:04.307 --> 01:11:06.190
Agent L. Hobbs.

01:11:06.567 --> 01:11:07.567
Hold on one second.

01:11:08.694 --> 01:11:09.735
Hey, Dom.

01:11:11.405 --> 01:11:13.197
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

01:11:16.034 --> 01:11:17.160
Yeah.

01:11:17.536 --> 01:11:20.997
Hobbs is the leader of the elite
task force for the DSS.

01:11:21.032 --> 01:11:22.171
So he's good.

01:11:22.206 --> 01:11:25.376
When the FBI wants to find somebody,
that's who they call.

01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:27.211
Because he never misses his mark.

01:11:27.246 --> 01:11:30.173
This guy is Old Testament.

01:11:30.549 --> 01:11:33.551
Blood, bullets, wrath of God.
That's his style.

01:11:33.927 --> 01:11:36.310
And right now he's hunting us?

01:11:36.345 --> 01:11:38.139
Dom, we got to move up our timeline.

01:11:38.174 --> 01:11:39.313
Yeah, but how?

01:11:39.348 --> 01:11:42.894
This thing's already been difficult
without Wyatt Earp on our asses.

01:11:43.479 --> 01:11:45.229
If anything, we need more room to breathe.

01:11:47.566 --> 01:11:48.941
Roman's right.

01:11:51.778 --> 01:11:54.238
Think we need to get some fresh air.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.244
We have got a hit. '70s Charger.

01:12:00.279 --> 01:12:02.330
Let's get a move on.

01:12:05.751 --> 01:12:08.336
Eastbound on Avenida Atlantica.

01:12:08.371 --> 01:12:09.837
Move, move, move, move.

01:12:16.094 --> 01:12:17.762
It stopped about a block ahead.

01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:19.847
Park it. We're going on foot.

01:12:43.163 --> 01:12:44.288
Hey, Toretto.

01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:54.006
You're under arrest.

01:12:54.299 --> 01:12:55.466
Arrest?

01:12:56.635 --> 01:12:58.553
I don't feel like I am under arrest.

01:12:59.304 --> 01:13:00.555
How about you, Brian?

01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:01.806
No, not a bit.

01:13:03.767 --> 01:13:04.982
Not even a little bit.

01:13:05.017 --> 01:13:07.353
Just give it a minute. It will sink in.

01:13:10.774 --> 01:13:13.234
We didn't kill those feds. That was Reyes.

01:13:13.269 --> 01:13:14.575
I don't give a shit.

01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:17.488
I am just here to bring in two assholes
whose names hit my desk.

01:13:17.781 --> 01:13:20.992
Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

01:13:24.037 --> 01:13:25.545
That's funny.

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:28.749
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,
then went against everything it stood for.

01:13:28.784 --> 01:13:30.550
Or some wannabe tough guy prick

01:13:30.585 --> 01:13:33.045
who beat a man half to death with
a socket wrench.

01:13:33.797 --> 01:13:35.006
Yeah, real tough.

01:13:36.008 --> 01:13:39.176
You turn around and put your
hands behind your back.

01:13:40.345 --> 01:13:41.727
I don't think so.

01:13:41.762 --> 01:13:44.473
Your mistake is thinking you
got a goddamn choice, boy.

01:13:48.645 --> 01:13:50.229
And your mistake?

01:13:50.856 --> 01:13:52.356
Thinking you're in America.

01:13:55.527 --> 01:13:59.030
You're a long way from home.

01:14:01.533 --> 01:14:04.035
This is Brazil.

01:14:19.259 --> 01:14:21.510
Come on, boss. Another day.

01:14:23.221 --> 01:14:25.681
Come on, H, it's a lot of heat.

01:14:30.896 --> 01:14:33.230
I will see you soon, Toretto.

01:14:34.566 --> 01:14:37.151
I look forward to it, cop.

01:15:14.439 --> 01:15:15.404
Yep.

01:15:15.439 --> 01:15:16.899
Tracker's on.

01:15:18.276 --> 01:15:19.276
Got them.

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:27.887
I don't understand. Why come here?

01:16:28.388 --> 01:16:31.223
Why risk it all for $20 worth of silver?

01:16:34.811 --> 01:16:36.061
Because it's worth it.

01:16:39.858 --> 01:16:41.400
You should run, you know.

01:16:42.152 --> 01:16:43.569
Hobbs will find you.

01:16:46.281 --> 01:16:49.200
You have every reason to leave.
Why stay?

01:16:56.625 --> 01:16:58.709
Why do you?

01:17:00.253 --> 01:17:02.254
My husband was a good police officer.

01:17:03.089 --> 01:17:04.715
An honest man.

01:17:06.134 --> 01:17:07.843
We both grew up here.

01:17:08.887 --> 01:17:11.138
Two years ago he was murdered
in the street...

01:17:11.173 --> 01:17:12.973
...right outside our door.

01:17:15.477 --> 01:17:19.230
Reyes owns this favela now.
He gives things to people.

01:17:21.566 --> 01:17:23.859
But everything has a price.

01:17:26.571 --> 01:17:28.322
The people here need a new start.

01:17:28.907 --> 01:17:30.407
They need to be free.

01:17:40.293 --> 01:17:41.919
You didn't kill those men in the train,

01:17:42.587 --> 01:17:43.879
did you?

01:17:48.426 --> 01:17:51.220
Now, why would you believe anything
I would tell you?

01:17:58.103 --> 01:17:59.395
Hey.

01:18:02.774 --> 01:18:04.483
Was she so special to you?

01:18:09.281 --> 01:18:11.615
I never thought
anyone could understand how much.

01:18:15.078 --> 01:18:16.453
But you do.

01:18:39.644 --> 01:18:40.644
Yeah.

01:18:51.865 --> 01:18:53.157
Close, but not enough.

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.249
Dom, the window is too small, man.

01:18:55.284 --> 01:18:59.121
Only way we're going to beat the
cameras is with invisible cars.

01:19:01.833 --> 01:19:04.209
And I know just where to get them.

01:19:07.339 --> 01:19:08.631
Let's take a ride, boys.

01:19:16.514 --> 01:19:18.557
Don't hurt yourself.

01:19:37.202 --> 01:19:39.578
It's been a while since I have been
behind the wheel of one of these.

01:19:39.871 --> 01:19:41.789
First time I have ever been in the front seat.

01:19:49.547 --> 01:19:51.090
Rome, what took you so long?

01:19:51.466 --> 01:19:55.302
I thought for sure you'd be showing up with
some chrome spinners or something.

01:19:56.388 --> 01:19:57.388
Real funny.

01:19:58.890 --> 01:20:02.518
I got $100,000 that says I can take
you all in the next quarter-mile.

01:20:02.553 --> 01:20:04.144
Yeah, your broke ass has got a hundred grand.

01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:06.563
If we pull off this job, I will.

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:08.399
The next two lights.

01:20:08.692 --> 01:20:09.858
Hundred thousand.

01:20:10.819 --> 01:20:13.612
We don't pull this job off,
we're probably dead anyway.

01:20:14.155 --> 01:20:16.198
Let's make it a million.

01:20:17.075 --> 01:20:19.410
I like that. All right,
a million-dollar quarter-mile.

01:20:20.662 --> 01:20:22.204
All right, then.

01:20:22.497 --> 01:20:25.040
You only live once. Let's do it.

01:20:25.542 --> 01:20:26.583
What do you say, Dom?

01:20:27.252 --> 01:20:28.711
We talking or we racing?

01:20:30.171 --> 01:20:31.255
Just don't cheat this time.

01:20:31.881 --> 01:20:34.508
Got to let that go.

01:20:53.111 --> 01:20:54.570
Yeah.

01:20:57.657 --> 01:20:58.706
Typical, Roman.

01:20:58.741 --> 01:21:01.285
I am going to get this money.
I am hungry.

01:21:09.586 --> 01:21:11.253
Don't make it too easy for me, boys.

01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:15.090
No.

01:21:16.301 --> 01:21:18.052
Not this time, Dom.

01:21:22.891 --> 01:21:24.641
You got to want it, Brian.

01:21:52.837 --> 01:21:56.673
Yeah. Owned you. Owned you.

01:22:11.439 --> 01:22:13.732
Good race, O'Conner. Thanks, Dom.

01:22:15.693 --> 01:22:18.487
Do you know how long
I have been waiting for that shit?

01:22:18.522 --> 01:22:20.531
I told you he didn't see it.

01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:22.414
Your man right there?

01:22:22.449 --> 01:22:25.097
He let off the throttle at the line.

01:22:25.132 --> 01:22:27.746
You didn't do nothing. He let you win.

01:22:28.706 --> 01:22:30.415
Bullshit.

01:22:51.563 --> 01:22:54.356
Vince, what are you doing? Quiet.
They have been tracking you.

01:23:02.991 --> 01:23:04.074
I know she's here.

01:23:06.578 --> 01:23:08.016
Find her.

01:23:08.051 --> 01:23:09.454
Go. Go. Go.

01:23:23.845 --> 01:23:25.477
It's okay. Wait.

01:23:25.512 --> 01:23:28.640
Reyes' guys were waiting for me at the market.

01:23:29.601 --> 01:23:31.226
Vince saved my life.

01:23:36.649 --> 01:23:38.108
You hungry?

01:23:41.279 --> 01:23:43.697
Yeah, sure. Good.

01:23:45.450 --> 01:23:46.658
Because you're saying grace.

01:23:49.871 --> 01:23:51.288
Thanks, Vince.

01:23:58.421 --> 01:23:59.469
Yo, you burned it.

01:23:59.504 --> 01:24:02.514
Yo, this is how my momma does it.
Relax.

01:24:02.549 --> 01:24:04.968
Yeah, but your mom is
the worst cook in the world.

01:24:05.003 --> 01:24:07.930
Yo, don't you be talking about my momma.

01:24:10.099 --> 01:24:12.455
Yeah, come on, baby. Who's good living?

01:24:12.490 --> 01:24:14.818
To you, bro. Cheers, cheers, cheers.

01:24:14.853 --> 01:24:17.147
So, we in Brazil. It's the good life.

01:24:17.182 --> 01:24:18.197
Yeah.

01:24:18.232 --> 01:24:22.110
So, you got a little more than
$10 or $11 million coming.

01:24:22.145 --> 01:24:23.320
What you going to do with your money?

01:24:23.355 --> 01:24:25.037
Me? Yeah.

01:24:25.072 --> 01:24:27.908
Actually, man, I been thinking about
opening up a garage back home.

01:24:28.868 --> 01:24:31.662
Place where people can bring their cars
and not get completely ripped off.

01:24:31.697 --> 01:24:32.871
You know what I mean?

01:24:32.906 --> 01:24:34.254
Really? Yeah.

01:24:34.289 --> 01:24:36.896
So, your dream is to start a day job?

01:24:36.931 --> 01:24:39.468
That's stupid. Like, why would...

01:24:39.503 --> 01:24:42.172
No, it's not stupid at all.
I love what I do.

01:24:42.207 --> 01:24:43.222
That don't make no sense to me.

01:24:43.257 --> 01:24:46.176
I know what I am going to do with my money.

01:24:48.179 --> 01:24:50.097
Buying some cooking lessons for my man.

01:24:50.598 --> 01:24:52.022
See? See?

01:24:52.057 --> 01:24:54.309
There you go with that negativity, man.

01:24:54.344 --> 01:24:56.526
You know me. Money ain't a goddamn thing.

01:24:56.561 --> 01:24:59.189
It's going to take a little more than
money to learn how to cook.

01:24:59.224 --> 01:25:00.524
That's horrible.

01:25:01.067 --> 01:25:04.736
But I heard they was looking for a
chef down at this animal shelter.

01:25:04.771 --> 01:25:06.234
You might want to...

01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:07.698
I know the manager.

01:25:13.121 --> 01:25:14.788
Hey, Dom.

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.001
Listen.

01:25:19.752 --> 01:25:23.463
I know that you're all
set for this job tomorrow,

01:25:23.498 --> 01:25:25.299
but if you need an extra man, I could...

01:25:25.334 --> 01:25:26.717
You're in.

01:25:35.143 --> 01:25:36.685
There's always room for family.

01:25:43.151 --> 01:25:44.192
Thank you.

01:25:48.781 --> 01:25:49.906
Get something to eat.

01:25:51.701 --> 01:25:53.327
Yeah.

01:25:55.204 --> 01:25:56.913
Can you believe Mia calls this a curse?

01:26:00.710 --> 01:26:02.878
She might be right.

01:26:07.216 --> 01:26:09.676
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

01:26:09.927 --> 01:26:14.181
When your life is on the line that's
when you learn about yourself.

01:26:19.145 --> 01:26:20.896
That's a fair deal.

01:26:24.192 --> 01:26:28.320
We're less than 24 hours from the
biggest celebration of our life.

01:26:28.355 --> 01:26:30.697
You all need a refill.
This is serious stuff.

01:26:30.732 --> 01:26:32.258
No, I am good. Cheers, baby.

01:26:32.293 --> 01:26:33.784
I am good. No, thank you.

01:26:33.819 --> 01:26:34.868
No, she can't.

01:26:37.121 --> 01:26:39.122
What do you mean? She can't.

01:26:39.457 --> 01:26:42.125
What do you mean she can't?
What is...

01:26:46.297 --> 01:26:48.513
Are you serious right now?

01:26:48.548 --> 01:26:52.344
Is that the reason you let him
beat you in the quarter-mile?

01:26:53.679 --> 01:26:56.932
That was a baby gift.
No, that's messed up.

01:26:56.967 --> 01:26:58.600
No, you're not taking that from me.

01:26:58.635 --> 01:27:00.275
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:04.689
So, did he just smack the ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?

01:27:05.066 --> 01:27:06.031
Which one was it?

01:27:06.066 --> 01:27:08.318
Congratulations. Thank you.

01:27:08.353 --> 01:27:10.504
How can you keep this a secret?

01:27:10.539 --> 01:27:12.621
Crazy, huh?
It's your boy.

01:27:12.656 --> 01:27:16.326
Why would you keep something
like that away from me?

01:27:16.661 --> 01:27:18.453
Baby gift, huh?

01:27:18.704 --> 01:27:21.540
I have no idea what they're talking about.
Oh?

01:27:21.575 --> 01:27:24.626
What happened to the pull-out method, man?

01:27:25.711 --> 01:27:27.754
Toast. Toast.

01:27:36.097 --> 01:27:39.349
Money will come and go. We know that.

01:27:40.476 --> 01:27:43.854
But the most important thing in life will
always be the people in this room.

01:27:45.273 --> 01:27:46.523
Right here.

01:27:49.152 --> 01:27:50.193
Right now.

01:28:04.792 --> 01:28:06.376
I am all set.

01:28:07.378 --> 01:28:10.380
Yo, Santos. Van good?

01:28:11.466 --> 01:28:13.675
You know we're always good, bro.

01:28:17.555 --> 01:28:20.265
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:22.976
We're not going to get a better window.

01:28:23.011 --> 01:28:25.277
Okay, guys, it's show time.

01:28:25.312 --> 01:28:26.980
First team in position, let's go.

01:28:27.015 --> 01:28:28.315
Come on, let's do this.

01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:41.620
Hey, Dom.

01:28:43.456 --> 01:28:44.581
I got eyes on Mia.

01:28:49.587 --> 01:28:52.672
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.

01:28:53.299 --> 01:28:55.175
And what do they all have in common?

01:28:55.210 --> 01:28:56.343
No extradition.

01:28:58.429 --> 01:29:01.181
We're one hour away from the rest of our lives.

01:29:01.216 --> 01:29:02.557
Yeah.

01:29:04.268 --> 01:29:05.268
Cops.

01:29:07.855 --> 01:29:09.231
Come on. Go.

01:29:20.826 --> 01:29:22.452
You just made a big mistake.

01:29:23.955 --> 01:29:25.872
Took me a while to find that tracking chip.

01:29:26.374 --> 01:29:27.749
But not as long to flip the receiver.

01:29:27.784 --> 01:29:29.334
You're going down, Toretto.

01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:31.461
I am right here.

01:30:59.592 --> 01:31:01.593
Dom. Stand back. I got this.

01:31:07.516 --> 01:31:11.436
Pull off. Dom. Please, stop.

01:31:17.068 --> 01:31:18.068
Dom.

01:31:27.244 --> 01:31:28.578
Dom.

01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:32.142
Yeah.

01:32:33.519 --> 01:32:35.478
We're coming in now.

01:32:37.064 --> 01:32:39.733
Have the marshals meet us at
the airport when we land.

01:32:47.616 --> 01:32:48.992
Ambush.

01:33:06.635 --> 01:33:09.846
Wilkes, suppression fire. Shut them down.

01:33:14.059 --> 01:33:15.727
Stagger-step. Cover me.

01:33:20.733 --> 01:33:21.775
Watch them.

01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:34.419
Cut us loose.

01:33:34.454 --> 01:33:36.539
Come on. Cut us loose.

01:35:34.992 --> 01:35:36.367
We're good? Yeah, let's go, let's go.

01:36:09.652 --> 01:36:11.277
Hey, Dom.

01:36:17.534 --> 01:36:19.702
You have got to meet my son.

01:36:19.995 --> 01:36:21.746
Nico.

01:36:26.502 --> 01:36:27.961
I will.

01:36:30.881 --> 01:36:32.131
He's a good kid.

01:36:35.970 --> 01:36:38.596
You know, we named him after you.

01:36:40.391 --> 01:36:41.724
"Dominic. "

01:36:48.983 --> 01:36:50.984
You have got my word, Vince.

01:36:57.533 --> 01:36:59.617
You were always my brother.

01:37:09.253 --> 01:37:11.754
I got eyes on Nico now.

01:37:22.433 --> 01:37:24.851
We need to move.
We don't have that much time.

01:37:24.886 --> 01:37:26.025
I got us a flight out.

01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:28.730
We can leave Rio in the
rearview in the next five hours.

01:37:28.765 --> 01:37:30.606
Not to run away.

01:37:32.026 --> 01:37:33.609
To finish the job.

01:37:34.445 --> 01:37:36.863
Are you crazy, Dom? We can't.

01:37:37.448 --> 01:37:39.032
It's a suicide mission.

01:37:40.117 --> 01:37:41.784
That's your man over there on the table.

01:37:43.162 --> 01:37:45.204
The plan is busted.

01:37:45.497 --> 01:37:47.999
This is bullshit, man.
Reyes knows we're coming.

01:37:48.034 --> 01:37:49.459
He's right.

01:37:49.752 --> 01:37:52.545
They tripled the detail at the police station.

01:37:52.963 --> 01:37:55.214
It's going to be a wall of gunfire.

01:37:57.426 --> 01:37:59.510
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

01:37:59.803 --> 01:38:01.054
It's a trap, man.

01:38:01.089 --> 01:38:02.305
You know that.

01:38:02.973 --> 01:38:05.308
Dom, listen to them.

01:38:05.976 --> 01:38:08.561
Run, before it's too late. Leave Rio.

01:38:09.938 --> 01:38:11.272
You can be free.

01:38:13.442 --> 01:38:15.443
Running ain't freedom.

01:38:16.904 --> 01:38:18.321
You should know that.

01:38:23.410 --> 01:38:25.828
You know you're all free to
make your own choices.

01:38:30.042 --> 01:38:31.167
I am in.

01:38:40.552 --> 01:38:42.178
I will ride with you, Toretto.

01:38:45.474 --> 01:38:48.017
At least until we kill that son of a bitch.

01:38:56.443 --> 01:38:58.027
So what's the plan, Dom?

01:38:58.862 --> 01:39:00.905
We can't just go sneaking around anymore.

01:39:02.407 --> 01:39:04.367
We don't sneak.

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:08.287
The only thing he cares about is his money.

01:39:08.539 --> 01:39:09.872
We pull that,

01:39:10.874 --> 01:39:12.291
we pull him.

01:39:29.685 --> 01:39:30.726
See?

01:39:31.895 --> 01:39:34.564
I called in every cop on our payroll.

01:39:36.066 --> 01:39:37.859
We're covered.

01:39:39.570 --> 01:39:41.696
We have got every entrance covered
with weapons teams.

01:39:41.731 --> 01:39:43.823
God Himself couldn't get at your
money if He wanted to.

01:39:44.324 --> 01:39:48.661
God isn't my worry.

01:39:58.422 --> 01:39:59.422
You ready?

01:40:01.717 --> 01:40:02.717
I am ready.

01:41:01.068 --> 01:41:02.158
What's happening?

01:41:02.193 --> 01:41:03.736
They're taking the vault.

01:41:03.771 --> 01:41:05.488
What? The vault.

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:18.292
Follow me. Quickly.

01:41:22.631 --> 01:41:24.131
Let me through.

01:41:34.184 --> 01:41:35.184
Don't move.

01:41:36.395 --> 01:41:37.770
Stay down.

01:42:07.759 --> 01:42:09.100
Call it out, Mia.

01:42:09.135 --> 01:42:10.720
You have got a straight shot for two blocks.

01:42:12.222 --> 01:42:13.723
Go right. Got it.

01:42:36.121 --> 01:42:37.670
Well, the plan is working.

01:42:37.705 --> 01:42:42.668
You guys have every corrupt cop in Rio
on your tail. You have to move fast.

01:42:42.703 --> 01:42:43.801
What's the best route?

01:42:43.836 --> 01:42:47.173
Okay, keep going straight another
half-mile onto Rua Fonseca,

01:42:47.208 --> 01:42:49.175
and then go left.

01:42:52.929 --> 01:42:53.971
That ain't going to work.

01:42:56.058 --> 01:42:57.641
Spikes ahead, Dom. We got spikes.

01:42:58.060 --> 01:42:59.643
We're going right.

01:43:01.021 --> 01:43:02.313
No, it's too tight, we're not going to fit.

01:43:02.348 --> 01:43:03.856
We have got no choice. Now.

01:43:23.543 --> 01:43:24.710
Shit.

01:43:31.343 --> 01:43:32.600
Holy shit.

01:43:32.635 --> 01:43:35.596
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter.
Did you just take out a bank?

01:43:44.648 --> 01:43:45.648
Two inbound.

01:43:48.068 --> 01:43:49.527
All right, there's an alley
coming up on your left.

01:43:49.562 --> 01:43:51.278
Yeah, I got it.

01:44:44.666 --> 01:44:46.292
You little bastard.

01:45:09.441 --> 01:45:12.151
All right, good job, Dom. Right-hander,
right here, right-hander.

01:45:18.533 --> 01:45:20.576
Guys, there's a big group coming
at you from the south.

01:45:20.611 --> 01:45:22.453
You have to do something now.

01:45:25.332 --> 01:45:26.373
Hey, go wide.

01:45:59.157 --> 01:46:00.157
Yeah.

01:47:14.024 --> 01:47:15.316
You're all clear on the left.

01:47:15.351 --> 01:47:17.234
Good afternoon, officer.

01:47:19.237 --> 01:47:21.655
License and registration, please.

01:47:27.871 --> 01:47:30.060
Yes. This is big-boy stuff.

01:47:30.095 --> 01:47:32.249
We're clear on the right.

01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:33.584
Oh, man.

01:47:40.383 --> 01:47:41.425
Thanks, guys.

01:47:41.801 --> 01:47:42.926
Any time.

01:47:43.219 --> 01:47:44.768
I will see you on the other side.

01:47:44.803 --> 01:47:47.181
You guys just carved out a 10-second window.

01:47:47.216 --> 01:47:48.724
Make it count.

01:47:56.066 --> 01:47:57.232
Zizi, stay on them.

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.678
They can't outrun us on the bridge.

01:48:27.639 --> 01:48:28.639
Shit.

01:48:35.730 --> 01:48:36.939
They have no way out.

01:48:38.942 --> 01:48:39.942
No.

01:48:40.777 --> 01:48:41.825
There's too many of them.

01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:43.904
Hey, there's too many of them.
We're not going to make it.

01:48:47.617 --> 01:48:48.617
You're right, we aren't.

01:48:49.911 --> 01:48:50.834
You are.

01:48:50.869 --> 01:48:52.246
What are you talking about?

01:48:52.455 --> 01:48:54.873
Just let the vault go.
Get out of there.

01:48:54.908 --> 01:48:56.632
You're a father now, Brian.

01:48:56.667 --> 01:48:58.919
No, I am not leaving you.
Now you stick with the plan.

01:48:59.629 --> 01:49:01.004
It was always the plan.

01:49:01.756 --> 01:49:03.013
Take care of Mia.

01:49:03.048 --> 01:49:05.551
Dom, you listen to me now. Okay?

01:49:05.586 --> 01:49:07.469
You cut loose right now.

01:49:24.821 --> 01:49:25.863
Hey, what is he doing?

01:49:29.826 --> 01:49:30.951
We have got him.

01:49:47.802 --> 01:49:49.052
Close down the bridge.

01:50:23.296 --> 01:50:24.671
Do something, asshole.

01:50:36.768 --> 01:50:37.893
Kill him, damn it.

01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:50.739
Kill him now.

01:52:02.437 --> 01:52:05.147
I thought I told you to go on.

01:52:07.108 --> 01:52:09.318
Yeah, I had to make a call.

01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:28.337
Help me.

01:52:30.715 --> 01:52:32.716
That's for my team, you son of a bitch.

01:52:36.888 --> 01:52:38.597
It's a hell of a mess.

01:52:39.307 --> 01:52:40.933
Yeah, it is.

01:52:42.435 --> 01:52:44.186
You know I can't let you two go.

01:52:44.687 --> 01:52:46.271
I ain't made that way.

01:52:49.025 --> 01:52:51.693
The way I see it,
you have earned yourselves 24 hours.

01:52:52.862 --> 01:52:53.862
The money stays, though.

01:52:55.198 --> 01:52:57.366
If I were you, I'd use the time.

01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:00.702
Make peace with whatever demons you got left.

01:53:05.166 --> 01:53:07.042
Because come tomorrow,

01:53:08.419 --> 01:53:09.544
I will find you.

01:53:21.391 --> 01:53:22.683
Toretto.

01:53:23.601 --> 01:53:24.893
I will see you soon.

01:53:27.730 --> 01:53:29.606
No, you won't.

01:54:11.065 --> 01:54:12.114
Thanks, guys.

01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:13.734
I will see you on the other side.

01:54:18.614 --> 01:54:21.074
You guys just carved out a 10 second window.

01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:22.451
Make it count.

01:55:04.869 --> 01:55:06.703
Come on, baby.

01:55:06.738 --> 01:55:08.538
Don't be mean.

01:55:10.792 --> 01:55:11.792
Come on.

01:56:23.406 --> 01:56:26.867
"For Rosa and Nico. See you soon, Uncle Dom"

01:56:39.922 --> 01:56:41.006
You sure about this?

01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:44.259
You know I am.

01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:47.679
You don't need to do this.

01:56:48.681 --> 01:56:50.981
Just leave me alone.

01:56:51.016 --> 01:56:53.143
Bro, I am not trying to be negative,
but casinos...

01:56:53.352 --> 01:56:56.062
...are the kinds of places designed to
take money from guys like you and me.

01:56:56.097 --> 01:56:59.900
When I win here I am buying you a lifetime
supply of antidepressants.

01:57:00.193 --> 01:57:03.195
You don't put ten million on red.

01:57:03.230 --> 01:57:04.202
Enough already.

01:57:04.237 --> 01:57:05.697
You put it on black.

01:57:08.284 --> 01:57:09.409
No more bets.

01:57:35.436 --> 01:57:37.646
Right this way, my dear.

01:57:39.690 --> 01:57:41.524
You stay right here,
I will be right back.

01:57:43.361 --> 01:57:45.133
So, this is your dream, huh?

01:57:45.168 --> 01:57:46.787
It's enough for me, man.

01:57:46.822 --> 01:57:48.371
I take it that's your dream.

01:57:48.406 --> 01:57:51.076
Absolutely. What up, boy?
What's going on?

01:57:51.111 --> 01:57:52.678
You good? Yes, yes.

01:57:52.713 --> 01:57:54.211
You know what's crazy?

01:57:54.246 --> 01:57:56.915
There's only four of those cars
in the whole world.

01:57:57.458 --> 01:57:59.876
Yeah, I got the only one in the
Western Hemisphere.

01:58:00.378 --> 01:58:04.673
I made a sheikh in Abu Dhabi
an offer he could not refuse.

01:58:05.007 --> 01:58:07.259
Huh.
That's a nice lady you got there, too.

01:58:07.294 --> 01:58:10.762
Absolutely. What's happening?

01:58:11.555 --> 01:58:13.765
We got to go, man. Let's do this.

01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:15.482
Okay, I will drive.

01:58:15.517 --> 01:58:18.144
In that? Come on, man, no way.

01:58:18.179 --> 01:58:20.522
No, no. Not in this.

01:58:20.557 --> 01:58:21.773
In that.

01:58:28.114 --> 01:58:29.656
Are you serious right now?

01:58:30.449 --> 01:58:31.748
Man, this is crazy.

01:58:31.783 --> 01:58:36.454
Yes, I guess that means there are two
in the Western Hemisphere, huh?

01:58:37.331 --> 01:58:39.666
What's your smart ass got to say now?

01:58:40.209 --> 01:58:43.628
You know what?
We can always shine together, baby.

01:58:43.663 --> 01:58:46.089
Get dressed, man, we got things to do.

01:58:58.519 --> 01:59:00.061
So, where to now?

01:59:00.096 --> 01:59:01.569
I don't know.

01:59:01.604 --> 01:59:04.030
Never been to Madrid.

01:59:04.065 --> 01:59:06.901
I thought you wanted to go to Tokyo.

01:59:06.936 --> 01:59:09.154
We will get there.

01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:10.864
Eventually.

02:00:10.216 --> 02:00:12.050
Nice surprise.

02:00:15.638 --> 02:00:17.305
Crazy, right?

02:00:25.523 --> 02:00:28.566
This is the happiest
I have ever seen my sister.

02:00:29.610 --> 02:00:31.611
It's because we're free.

02:00:44.959 --> 02:00:47.210
You know, I want another shot.

02:00:50.756 --> 02:00:51.756
Yeah?

02:00:53.843 --> 02:00:55.475
Yeah.

02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:57.394
No wagers, nobody else.

02:00:57.429 --> 02:00:59.681
Just you and me, once and for all.

02:01:06.772 --> 02:01:08.731
You sure you can handle the disappointment?

02:01:09.608 --> 02:01:11.025
Are you?

02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:15.321
All right, O'Conner.

02:01:15.356 --> 02:01:17.323
Let's see what you got.

02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:47.015
You need to look at that.

02:03:50.936 --> 02:03:52.895
Berlin, 3:00 a. m. this morning.

02:03:53.147 --> 02:03:55.940
A team of drivers hijacked a military convoy.

02:03:55.975 --> 02:03:57.859
Toretto? Nope.

02:03:58.861 --> 02:03:59.784
I ain't interested.

02:03:59.819 --> 02:04:02.739
Yes, you are. Keep looking.

02:04:14.251 --> 02:04:16.085
Do you believe in ghosts?
