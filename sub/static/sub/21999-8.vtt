- You know, the only reason

to take one or two pills a day.

- it doesn't mean it made him suicidal.

10:25.783 --> 10:27.532
I'm digging, but, honestly,

10:27.534 --> 10:29.785
I don't think there's any "there" there.

10:29.787 --> 10:31.920
I knew Simon. We all did.

10:32.741 --> 10:34.256
Wh-What about the company itself?

10:34.909 --> 10:36.758
This is Tessa Snyder,

10:36.760 --> 10:38.010
the company CEO.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.679
A competitor once described her
as "a burning hot pepper

10:40.681 --> 10:42.464
disguised as an ice cream sundae ""

10:42.466 --> 10:44.961
Wow. Can't wait to meet her.

10:46.004 --> 10:47.803
Danny? ‭Well, I'm trying to get a list

10:47.805 --> 10:49.388
of the other participants in the study.

10:49.390 --> 10:51.607
And, believe it or not,
I may have a lead.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.975
Okay. (CLICKS TONGUE)

10:52.977 --> 10:56.144
Well, I guess we'll wait
to hear from the big guy

10:56.146 --> 10:57.396
about voir dire.

10:57.398 --> 10:58.924
What's he doing in there?

10:58.926 --> 11:00.148
It's not what.

11:00.150 --> 11:01.853
It's who.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.604
BULL: Wait a second! Isn't that London's

11:06.606 --> 11:07.585
Arti Cander?

11:07.587 --> 11:09.240
Is there nothing she can't do?

11:09.242 --> 11:11.525
Graduated with honors from
Oxford, then moved to D.C.

11:11.527 --> 11:13.694
to became a lobbyist
in the candy industry.

11:13.696 --> 11:15.661
Tough job. No one likes candy.

11:15.688 --> 11:17.688
And then decided to start all over again

11:17.690 --> 11:19.190
and enter the trial science business.

11:19.192 --> 11:22.193
Mm. Someone figured out how to Google.

11:22.195 --> 11:23.778
You left out the part

11:23.780 --> 11:25.413
where I spent three years at Georgetown

11:25.415 --> 11:26.998
studying law and human behavior.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.115
Oh, and you.

11:28.117 --> 11:30.534
I forgot to mention this
the other day, but

11:30.536 --> 11:32.370
I firmly do believe that you are one

11:32.372 --> 11:33.968
of the two best at what you do.

11:33.970 --> 11:35.456
Wait. Is this the part where

11:35.458 --> 11:36.920
I'm supposed to say,
"But who's the other""

11:36.922 --> 11:39.844
Oh, you don't have to say it...
just as long as you think it.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.233
So is it true you don't
use mirror jurors?

11:42.235 --> 11:43.685
Yeah, I've never really seen the point.

11:43.687 --> 11:45.531
It's an extrapolation once removed.

11:45.533 --> 11:47.188
Then how do you know what
the jurors are thinking?

11:47.190 --> 11:49.607
I read them... all by myself.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.025
You should try it sometime.

11:51.027 --> 11:52.861
Oh, I wouldn't know where to begin.

11:52.863 --> 11:55.997
Perhaps after I've had
the opportunity to study you.

11:56.407 --> 11:59.534
Sorry. We're not taking
any new students at the moment.

11:59.536 --> 12:01.336
I'll see you in court, Dr. Bull.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.874
(LOW CONVERSATIONS)

12:06.626 --> 12:07.959
BENNY: There he is.

12:07.961 --> 12:11.629
Dr. Jason Bull, this is Mr.
and Mrs. Jones, Simon's parents.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.798
Thank you for doing this, Dr. Bull.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.384
Well, we haven't done anything
yet, but you're very welcome.

12:16.386 --> 12:18.513
Do you mind if I steal
Mr. Colón for a moment?

12:19.055 --> 12:20.348
Excuse me.

12:25.019 --> 12:28.396
I am totally in the dark about
our approach to voir dire.

12:28.398 --> 12:30.064
MARISSA (OVER EARBUD):
That would make two of us, Bull.

12:30.066 --> 12:31.533
Is it as simple as finding people

12:31.535 --> 12:34.035
who feel anger towards
the pharmaceutical companies?

12:34.037 --> 12:35.570
'Cause there are plenty of those.

12:35.572 --> 12:37.038
I wish. No.

12:37.625 --> 12:38.990
Just because people are mad at a company

12:38.992 --> 12:40.792
or even an entire industry doesn't mean

12:40.794 --> 12:42.076
they're gonna side with us.

12:42.453 --> 12:45.413
Shared experience does not equal empathy.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.132
In fact, a lot of times,
it's just the opposite.

12:48.134 --> 12:50.218
It's called the empathy gap.

12:50.220 --> 12:53.471
I worry that they are gonna
see Simon as someone

12:53.473 --> 12:56.724
who willingly signed up
for a risky job in an industry

12:56.726 --> 12:58.676
famous for its greed and arrogance,

12:58.678 --> 13:00.511
and should have known better.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.564
Mm-hmm. So, what are we looking for?

13:02.566 --> 13:04.482
Perversely, I am thinking

13:04.484 --> 13:08.486
of going after jurors who
trust powerful corporations.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.938
Now I'm confused.

13:09.940 --> 13:11.439
I would've thought that's
exactly who we don't want.

13:11.441 --> 13:12.607
BULL: Think about it.

13:12.609 --> 13:15.159
Who better to understand
what happened to Simon

13:15.161 --> 13:18.446
than someone who takes
big companies at their word.

13:18.448 --> 13:20.832
We'll tell them a story about a young man

13:20.834 --> 13:23.201
who trusted the people he worked for,

13:23.203 --> 13:25.954
never questioning their intentions

13:25.956 --> 13:28.623
or their honesty till it was too late.

13:29.375 --> 13:32.627
And hopefully, we'll shock 'em
into siding with us.

13:33.129 --> 13:35.179
Mm. Well,

13:35.840 --> 13:38.216
at the very least,
she'll never see it coming.

13:38.635 --> 13:40.268
MARISSA: Eddie Dunn, 33 years old.

13:40.270 --> 13:42.136
He is a toy wholesaler, so,

13:42.138 --> 13:45.139
he depends on big manufacturers
for his livelihood.

13:45.141 --> 13:47.475
He is the poster boy
for the kind of juror they think

13:47.477 --> 13:49.444
they want and think we don't.

13:49.446 --> 13:50.979
Excellent. This should be fun.

13:50.981 --> 13:52.363
ATTORNEY: Say you buy a product...

13:52.365 --> 13:54.616
sandwich bags... you get them home,

13:54.618 --> 13:56.784
but none of the zippers work.

13:56.786 --> 13:58.736
What do you do? Do you drive

13:58.738 --> 14:00.488
all the way back to the store

14:00.490 --> 14:02.790
and make them exchange
it for another box?

14:02.792 --> 14:04.993
Do you, uh, write to the manufacturer?

14:04.995 --> 14:06.411
Or do you just

14:06.413 --> 14:09.580
shrug it off, throw the box
away and get on with your life?

14:09.582 --> 14:10.882
Me? I'd go back to the store.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.501
- Because?
- ‭Any reputable store is gonna want

14:13.503 --> 14:15.386
to make good on that purchase.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.889
And so is the manufacturer, by the way.

14:18.257 --> 14:20.758
There's nothing to be gained
by angering a customer.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.925
This juror's acceptable to the defense.

14:22.927 --> 14:25.146
He's good, but Bull's gonna strike him.

14:25.148 --> 14:27.315
Does the plaintiff wish
to question this juror?

14:27.317 --> 14:30.217
This juror is acceptable to
the plaintiff, too, Your Honor.

14:30.530 --> 14:31.653
Thank you.

14:34.157 --> 14:37.492
If you have a choice, do you
prefer store brand products,

14:37.494 --> 14:39.360
or name brand products?

14:39.362 --> 14:40.778
Most of the time, store brand.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.447
Any particular reason why?

14:42.449 --> 14:44.499
Bears don't use toilet paper.

14:44.501 --> 14:46.417
And mermaids don't drink coffee.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.369
I'm not paying for the trademark.

14:48.371 --> 14:50.371
I'm paying for the product.

14:50.373 --> 14:52.001
- That's very clever.

about drug companies?

14:56.739 --> 14:58.429
I wish their drugs cost less.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.214
But then... I wish everything cost less.

15:05.722 --> 15:08.189

prescription drugs at all?

15:08.191 --> 15:09.941

what they're supposed to do?

15:13.634 --> 15:15.229
- need them to help with?
- Yes.

if you didn't have them?

15:17.233 --> 15:18.399

15:18.401 --> 15:19.867
Yes, definitely.

15:21.905 --> 15:23.871

I don't know. It's really a long shot.

But the funny thing is, I didn't
even find him on the Internet.

I dug up his application
from when he worked here,

he put this guy.

my phone didn't ring,

19:03.259 --> 19:04.397
No, he did not.

that he was participating
in a drug trial.

19:13.857 --> 19:16.108
to talk about how close you were?

19:17.098 --> 19:19.077
And couldn't it be that the reason

19:19.079 --> 19:23.198
he sounded... what word
did you use?... muted was because

19:23.200 --> 19:25.033

19:46.557 --> 19:48.807
that allows you to hypothesize

19:48.809 --> 19:51.226
from hearing someone's voice on the phone

19:51.228 --> 19:53.278
whether they have been affected
in any way

19:53.280 --> 19:55.397
by a medication they might have taken?

19:56.053 --> 19:57.866
No, I do not.

20:00.558 --> 20:02.237
No further questions.

20:02.239 --> 20:04.406
There is so little movement
here, I'm starting to wonder

20:04.408 --> 20:06.491
if we're having a systems failure.

20:06.493 --> 20:10.462
I'm trying to put a good face
on this, but you're not helping.

20:14.251 --> 20:16.418
(CROWD CHATTER)

20:18.555 --> 20:20.555
Kevin? Kevin Wright?

20:20.557 --> 20:24.309
Hi. Um, can I ask you some questions

20:24.311 --> 20:26.812
about a clinical trial
you participated in?

20:34.188 --> 20:35.987
You were in the Dep Pharmaceutical

20:35.989 --> 20:37.939
antidepressant trial, yeah?

20:37.941 --> 20:39.574
That was supposed to be confidential.

20:39.576 --> 20:41.109
It's not something I'm really anxious

20:41.111 --> 20:42.600
for people to know about.

20:43.726 --> 20:45.247
I'm sorry if I startled you.

20:45.249 --> 20:46.479
It's just...

20:47.501 --> 20:51.119
one of the other participants,
Simon Jones, died.

20:51.567 --> 20:53.538
Committed suicide, actually.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.572
I'm just trying
to figure out what happened.

20:58.962 --> 21:00.701
Did you know each other well?

21:01.034 --> 21:03.965
Uh, we never really hung
out or anything, but...

21:04.872 --> 21:06.685
we ended up in a lot of the same trials.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.304
Once you do one, and
you see how easy it is,

21:09.306 --> 21:10.878
how much money they pay...

21:12.776 --> 21:15.694
We were both what they
call healthy volunteers,

21:15.696 --> 21:17.927
and there was a big
demand for that, so...

21:19.720 --> 21:21.733
I'm sorry. Uh, my head is spinning.

21:21.735 --> 21:23.368
It's a shock.

21:23.370 --> 21:25.821
Well, forgive me.
What's a healthy volunteer?

21:25.823 --> 21:27.572
Uh, people who don't have the illness

21:27.574 --> 21:29.040
the drug is being tested for.

21:29.042 --> 21:30.208
Got it.

21:30.210 --> 21:31.493
Well, last question.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.703
Why did you drop out of the study?

21:33.705 --> 21:35.630
KEVIN: When I'm not working at the gym,

21:35.632 --> 21:36.965
I'm training for marathons.

21:36.967 --> 21:38.895
I try to do six to eight miles a day.

21:38.897 --> 21:40.469
Been doing it for years.

21:40.471 --> 21:44.256
But a couple of days after
I started the Dep trial, I...

21:44.258 --> 21:45.871
I don't know. I...

21:47.344 --> 21:51.680
I started having these feelings
of... dread.

21:52.128 --> 21:54.850
I was supposed to fly to Chicago
for a friend's wedding.

21:55.256 --> 21:56.799
Couldn't get on the plane.

21:57.321 --> 21:59.354
Became convinced that it was gonna crash.

21:59.969 --> 22:03.859
And that same weekend... I think
it was Saturday morning...

22:03.861 --> 22:05.374
I couldn't get out of bed.

22:05.376 --> 22:08.269
Just skipped training
altogether, and I never do that.

22:08.978 --> 22:11.750
But then the next day, Sunday,

22:11.752 --> 22:13.752
I'm running across Brooklyn Bridge,

22:13.754 --> 22:16.193
and I'm staring down at the water,

22:16.761 --> 22:20.030
and the next thing I know, I stop

22:20.711 --> 22:23.712
and I'm figuring out
how to get over the rail

22:23.714 --> 22:27.288
and onto the crossbeam so I can jump,

22:28.205 --> 22:30.435
because that's what my body wants to do.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.021
It wants to fall.

22:33.919 --> 22:36.024
It wants to be in the water.

22:36.026 --> 22:38.026
It wants to never come back up.

22:40.030 --> 22:43.031
But I stopped myself. I...

22:43.033 --> 22:45.317
sat down there right on the bridge,

22:45.319 --> 22:46.807
tried to breathe.

22:47.204 --> 22:48.684
Called my parents.

22:50.157 --> 22:51.645
I didn't want to die,

22:52.563 --> 22:54.470
but my mind was telling me to let go.

22:55.725 --> 22:57.867
There's nothing scarier
than realizing your brain

22:57.869 --> 22:59.236
is plotting against you.

23:01.852 --> 23:03.477

questions for the witness?

23:16.099 --> 23:17.963
HANSEN: Morning, sir.

23:18.652 --> 23:20.936
Do you recognize this document?

23:21.550 --> 23:22.821
I-I do.

23:22.823 --> 23:24.272
It's a consent form I signed

23:24.274 --> 23:26.942
to participate in the
Dep Pharmaceutical trial.

23:26.944 --> 23:28.910
And, uh, is this your signature

23:28.912 --> 23:30.412
at the bottom of it?

23:30.414 --> 23:31.382
It is.

23:31.384 --> 23:33.448
And, uh, can you tell us the purpose

23:33.450 --> 23:36.251
of the mandatory washout period?

23:36.253 --> 23:38.776
It's mentioned in the
third paragraph there.

23:39.790 --> 23:44.426
It's, uh, the period of time
between drug trials.

23:44.428 --> 23:46.928
It's something the companies insist on.

23:46.930 --> 23:50.098
It exists to make sure
their drugs don't interact

23:50.100 --> 23:52.434
with someone else's drugs
from an earlier trial.

23:52.436 --> 23:54.803
I think we've just been "Candered."

23:54.805 --> 23:57.305
HANSEN: And on this form you signed,

23:57.307 --> 23:59.975
how long is the specified washout period?

23:59.977 --> 24:02.310
It specifies 30 days.

24:02.312 --> 24:03.561
30 days.

24:03.563 --> 24:06.314
And what were you doing 27 days

24:06.316 --> 24:09.091
before you started the
Dep Pharmaceutical trial?

24:09.093 --> 24:12.287
Remember, you are under oath.

24:13.156 --> 24:14.956
Well, I was doing a lot of things.

24:15.905 --> 24:20.128
But, uh, one of them was,
I was finishing up

24:20.130 --> 24:22.714
the Manhattan Hill Medical
painkiller trial.

24:22.716 --> 24:24.059
Last day, last dose.

24:24.061 --> 24:26.334
And do you happen to know if Simon Jones

24:26.336 --> 24:27.825
was in that trial as well?

24:28.711 --> 24:31.089
Um, yes, he was.

24:31.091 --> 24:33.258
What drug trial are they talking about?

24:33.260 --> 24:34.759
Where are they getting this

24:34.761 --> 24:35.971
and why don't we have it?

24:35.973 --> 24:38.680
HANSEN: Is 27 days
the same thing as 30 days?

24:38.682 --> 24:40.148
- KEVIN: Of course not.
- HANSEN: Then how do you know

24:40.150 --> 24:41.599
it wasn't the interaction
of the painkiller

24:41.601 --> 24:43.234
with the antidepressant that caused

24:43.236 --> 24:45.270
the suicidal ideation
the two of you experienced?

24:45.272 --> 24:48.012
Because... I know.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.498
Look, we've done so many of these things.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.529
And it's... everyone does it.

24:55.102 --> 24:57.332
No further questions.

25:13.029 --> 25:14.963
I don't understand.
You interviewed Kevin.

25:14.988 --> 25:15.980
DANNY: Yeah.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.273
Obviously he didn't tell me
that he and Simon

25:18.275 --> 25:19.377
weren't living up to their consent

25:19.402 --> 25:20.475
- form agreements.
- BULL: Well.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.931
And there was no way of knowing
about the other drug trial.

25:22.933 --> 25:25.697
Drug trials in the research
stages of pre-FDA approval

25:25.699 --> 25:27.332
don't need to be reported.

25:27.334 --> 25:29.625
- Well, Dep knew about it.
- BENNY: No.

25:29.627 --> 25:33.288
My guess is, Manhattan Hill
Medical tipped them off.

25:33.290 --> 25:36.018
These drug companies
are fiercely competitive,

25:36.627 --> 25:39.745
but they don't like the idea
of being taken to the cleaners

25:39.747 --> 25:42.831

they use to pay chump change

25:42.833 --> 25:44.166

25:45.419 --> 25:47.252
Ten against us, two for us.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.254
There's no movement at all?

25:49.256 --> 25:51.473
Sometimes it goes to 11 against us.

25:51.658 --> 25:54.978
How about that
emergency contact guy? Tom?

25:54.980 --> 25:57.846
Tom Greaver. I can't find him.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.428
Nor can I.

26:10.177 --> 26:13.680
We, uh, really don't have one.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.625
Terrific.

Tomorrow morning when we rest
our non-case,

26:19.679 --> 26:22.039
the only mystery will be,

26:22.041 --> 26:24.598
is the defense gonna have
a field day toying with us,

26:24.600 --> 26:27.726
or will they be humane and ask
for an immediate dismissal?

26:28.513 --> 26:30.072
I'm sorry, Dr. Bull.

26:30.860 --> 26:33.111
I never should have come
to you with this.

26:33.399 --> 26:36.650
Well, that's why I normally
make it a point

26:36.652 --> 26:39.036
not to work on behalf
of immature slackers

26:39.038 --> 26:40.621
who quit without notice,

26:40.623 --> 26:42.372
lie without giving it a second thought,

26:42.374 --> 26:44.541
and jump off rooftops without any regard

26:44.543 --> 26:46.380
for the people they leave behind.

30:31.020 --> 30:32.272
Oh, you were.

30:33.857 --> 30:35.806
But we've been together a while,

30:35.808 --> 30:37.808
so I know it's only because you care.

30:37.810 --> 30:39.526
I hate to lose.

30:41.948 --> 30:43.147
Let's go with yours.

30:44.618 --> 30:45.649
BENNY: That was, uh...

30:46.119 --> 30:47.818
quite a fascinating story you told

30:47.820 --> 30:49.903
about your friend Simon
just before we adjourned.

30:49.905 --> 30:52.222
It wasn't a story.

30:52.224 --> 30:55.075
I didn't mean to imply anything,
Mr. Greaver.

30:56.296 --> 30:58.078
But I am curious.

30:59.007 --> 31:01.510
Your mom kept Narcan at home?

31:02.001 --> 31:04.657
Well, like I said, she was
an emergency room nurse.

31:04.659 --> 31:05.719
Still...

31:06.223 --> 31:09.640
was she anticipating your best
friend suffering an overdose

31:09.642 --> 31:12.176
or was she just the best
prepared mom on the block?

31:12.178 --> 31:13.977
Objection. Calls for speculation,

31:13.979 --> 31:16.013
and counselor's tone is provocative.

31:16.015 --> 31:17.181
I'll withdraw the question.

31:17.853 --> 31:19.733
Now, if I wanted

31:19.735 --> 31:22.769
to corroborate this story,
who can I speak to?

31:22.771 --> 31:24.855
Say, your mom, or...?

31:24.857 --> 31:26.240
Unfortunately, she passed four years ago.

31:27.202 --> 31:28.825
I'm so sorry to hear that.

31:29.496 --> 31:32.613
Okay. All right. So-so-so let's review.

31:32.615 --> 31:34.248
Your mother's no longer with us.

31:34.250 --> 31:36.033
Simon is no longer with us.

31:36.035 --> 31:38.202
Really, the only person
that we can rely on

31:38.204 --> 31:41.242
regarding the truthfulness
of the story is-is you.

31:41.244 --> 31:42.775
Isn't that correct?

31:42.777 --> 31:44.758
Yeah. I suppose that's true.

31:45.887 --> 31:47.711
The only reason I mention it, is...

31:49.015 --> 31:52.099
we can't find any history
whatsoever on Simon,

31:52.101 --> 31:54.518
with regard to drug use.

31:54.938 --> 31:56.022
None.

31:57.412 --> 32:00.769
But there is quite a dossier
on a fellow named Tom Belmond,

32:01.658 --> 32:03.277
who went to college with you and Simon.

32:04.364 --> 32:06.780
Arrests for, uh, possession.

32:06.782 --> 32:08.439
Arrests for sales of narcotics.

32:08.441 --> 32:09.899
Three hospitalizations

32:09.901 --> 32:11.702
for overdoses, and then,

32:11.704 --> 32:13.070
ultimately, of course, expulsion.

32:13.072 --> 32:14.488
BULL: What's that sound?

32:14.490 --> 32:17.273
Is that the sound of jurors
starting to move?

32:17.275 --> 32:19.793
Do you happen to know a Tom Belmond?

32:21.423 --> 32:22.481
I'm-I'm sorry.

32:22.483 --> 32:24.047
I-I didn't hear your response.

32:24.220 --> 32:25.920
You ever hear of a Tom Belmond?

32:28.174 --> 32:30.091
I see, you're-you're having
trouble with this.

32:30.093 --> 32:33.511
Okay. All right. I-I'll make it
a little easier for you.

32:34.853 --> 32:36.230
Aren't you Tom Belmond?

32:36.232 --> 32:38.599
Objection. Is the attorney
asking questions

32:38.601 --> 32:40.818
or making third party pronouncements?

32:40.820 --> 32:42.019
Sustained.

32:42.021 --> 32:43.404
Ask a question, counselor.

32:43.406 --> 32:44.772
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

32:44.774 --> 32:47.108
You just got back your two
jurors from yesterday.

32:47.110 --> 32:49.410
- I feel the wind shifting.
- BENNY: Didn't you change your name

32:49.412 --> 32:51.779
from Tom Belmond
to Tom Greaver precisely,

32:51.781 --> 32:53.448
so you can avoid having to mention

32:53.450 --> 32:55.366
your arrest history,
your history with drugs,

32:55.368 --> 32:57.668
while seeking employment and housing...

32:57.670 --> 33:00.421
I wanted a fresh start, okay?

33:00.423 --> 33:02.457
I made a lot of mistakes as a kid, but...

33:02.459 --> 33:05.009
MARISSA: One more just came over.

33:05.011 --> 33:07.545
- We are now at nine red and three green.
- BENNY: And isn't it true

33:07.547 --> 33:09.680
your mother smuggled Narcan
out of the emergency room,

33:09.682 --> 33:12.016
not because she was worried about Simon,

33:12.018 --> 33:13.801
who had no interest in drugs,

33:13.803 --> 33:15.603
but because she was terrified

33:15.605 --> 33:17.472
that her own son might overdose one day?

33:17.474 --> 33:18.856
- Objection.
- And the story

33:18.858 --> 33:21.893
about Simon Jones
attempting to commit suicide

33:21.895 --> 33:23.811
eight years ago with heroin
was just that.

33:23.813 --> 33:25.646
- It was just a story, right?
- Objection.

33:25.648 --> 33:28.649
Again, these are pronouncements,
not questions, Your Honor.

33:28.651 --> 33:30.985
One more green light.

33:30.987 --> 33:33.204
They've got eight, and we've got four.

33:33.206 --> 33:34.822
Now the fun really begins.

33:34.824 --> 33:37.041
Well, then, here's the question:
how much did Dep pay you

33:37.043 --> 33:39.494
to take the stand
and perjure yourself today,

33:39.496 --> 33:41.295
Mr. Greaver or Mr. Belmond,

33:41.297 --> 33:43.047
- or whoever you say you are?!
- Objection,

33:43.049 --> 33:44.499
- Your Honor.
- Sustained.

33:44.501 --> 33:45.833
No problem, Your Honor.

33:46.132 --> 33:48.302
- Question withdrawn.
- (GALLEY MURMURING)

33:48.860 --> 33:49.887
I think I'd rather not know.

33:49.889 --> 33:52.173
No further questions, please.

33:53.098 --> 33:54.509
How's that for an inference?

33:54.511 --> 33:55.893
MARISSA: Now we've got five,

33:55.895 --> 33:57.011
and they've got seven.

33:57.013 --> 33:58.396
BULL: Nice work.

33:58.398 --> 34:00.681
JUDGE: Court will resume
tomorrow morning.

34:02.519 --> 34:04.519
Read any good jurors lately?

34:04.521 --> 34:06.153
Well, yes, I have.

34:06.528 --> 34:08.856
And I suspect that you have, too.

34:09.239 --> 34:10.690
But we both know that I'm reading

34:10.693 --> 34:12.360
more good jurors than you are, Dr. Bull,

34:12.362 --> 34:14.529
so stop trying to play with me.

34:15.245 --> 34:16.531
Although, I suspect

34:16.533 --> 34:19.951
that at some point,
we might get to that, too.

34:20.786 --> 34:22.954
(TRAFFIC SOUNDS)

34:26.376 --> 34:28.543
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

34:31.431 --> 34:33.547
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

34:33.550 --> 34:35.766
I'm looking for Edgar Paulson?

34:41.605 --> 34:43.190
CHUNK: Mr. Paulson's name

34:43.192 --> 34:44.725
is on a list of people who participated

34:44.726 --> 34:47.027
in a drug trial that we're investigating.

34:47.030 --> 34:48.696
(CHUCKLES): It took me a
while to track him down.

34:48.697 --> 34:50.982
Is there any way I could speak to him?

34:50.984 --> 34:54.068
I'm sorry. Uh, Mr. Paulson's
no longer with us.

34:54.701 --> 34:57.822
Is there any way you could share
a forwarding address?

34:57.824 --> 34:59.740
Some way to contact him?

35:01.458 --> 35:03.828
Mr. Paulson hung himself

35:04.336 --> 35:05.997
about three and a half weeks ago.

35:05.999 --> 35:07.715
(EXHALES)

35:08.214 --> 35:10.134
I'm so sorry.

35:10.508 --> 35:11.552
I had no idea.

35:11.554 --> 35:13.754
I actually checked
all the names on this list

35:13.756 --> 35:15.806
for deaths and hospitalizations.

35:15.808 --> 35:18.009
I don't know how that got past me.

35:18.266 --> 35:19.844
I'm sure it'll show up shortly.

35:19.846 --> 35:21.820
The woman who took care of him,

35:22.312 --> 35:23.981
she struck me as very thorough.

35:23.983 --> 35:25.316
A woman?

35:25.318 --> 35:28.152
Well, someone he worked with. Or for.

35:28.526 --> 35:30.104
She would stop by here.

35:30.445 --> 35:31.989
Make sure he took his medicine.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.075
Gave him money occasionally.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.944
She stopped by to see him
the morning we found him.

35:36.946 --> 35:39.163
She was terribly upset.

35:39.579 --> 35:41.282
Took care of all the details.

35:41.414 --> 35:43.618
Even paid for his cremation.

35:44.751 --> 35:47.625
Would you happen to have
her name? This woman?

35:47.627 --> 35:49.365
TESSA: My name is Tessa Snyder.

35:49.367 --> 35:52.593
I am Chief Executive Officer
for Dep Pharmaceutical.

35:52.595 --> 35:54.462
Have been for about three years now.

35:54.464 --> 35:56.097
And can you tell the jury

35:56.099 --> 35:57.798
what we're doing here today?

35:57.800 --> 36:00.601
And by that I mean
we all know drug companies

36:00.603 --> 36:03.437
face legal actions like this
all the time.

36:03.439 --> 36:05.473
Usually they're settled out of court.

36:05.475 --> 36:08.976
But why did you, a young CEO,
choose to fight this out

36:08.978 --> 36:11.016
- in a public forum?
- ‭BULL: Nice move.

36:11.018 --> 36:13.614
She's turning the very fact
that we're suing her client

36:13.616 --> 36:16.233
into a laudable thing
in the eyes of the jury.

36:16.616 --> 36:18.319
I may steal that.

36:19.739 --> 36:23.144
One, this company
has an unblemished record

36:23.146 --> 36:25.409
with regard to drug and testing safety.

36:25.750 --> 36:29.080
And two, this new drug...

36:29.082 --> 36:31.966
the first created under my leadership...

36:32.507 --> 36:34.835
is truly a pharmaceutical miracle

36:34.837 --> 36:37.254
for people who suffer from depression.

36:37.721 --> 36:41.225
I welcomed the opportunity
to tell the court,

36:41.227 --> 36:43.626
the jury, the world, about it.

36:43.628 --> 36:45.370
And can you tell the jury

36:45.886 --> 36:46.931
why you conduct

36:46.933 --> 36:48.773
these clinical trials?

36:48.798 --> 36:50.768
Well, the first thing you need to know

36:50.770 --> 36:54.739
is I got into this business to help ease

36:54.741 --> 36:56.323
human suffering.

36:56.781 --> 36:58.075
I mention that

36:58.077 --> 37:01.529
because I need you to know
how deeply sorry I am

37:01.531 --> 37:02.863
for the Jones family's loss.

37:02.865 --> 37:06.054
BULL: Excellent segue. Nicely written.

37:06.056 --> 37:07.368
Nicely performed.

37:07.370 --> 37:08.836
Having said that,

37:08.838 --> 37:11.038
we did nothing wrong.

37:11.421 --> 37:13.841
Simon was screened.

37:13.843 --> 37:16.544
The fact that he was not
completely truthful

37:16.546 --> 37:18.012
is not something we can control.

37:18.014 --> 37:19.263
MARISSA: Just so you know,

37:19.265 --> 37:21.432
our mirror jury is loving her.

37:21.434 --> 37:22.717
How can you not?

37:27.020 --> 37:29.557
And while we need to do better

37:29.559 --> 37:30.891
to ferret out the liars,

37:30.893 --> 37:32.893
we can't let it stop our work.

37:32.895 --> 37:35.824
These clinical trials
exist for the greater good.

37:35.826 --> 37:37.198
Without them,

37:37.200 --> 37:40.339
there wouldn't be medical
innovations and discoveries,

37:40.341 --> 37:42.119
new cures for everything

37:42.121 --> 37:44.488
from reproductive health to cancer.

37:44.490 --> 37:46.123
BULL: Something's going on.

37:46.125 --> 37:48.826
She's targeting juror three. Why?

37:48.828 --> 37:51.559
Well, she's one of our greens,
and she just went red.

37:51.561 --> 37:54.048
Her friend recently passed from cancer.

37:54.050 --> 37:57.551
Wow. This woman will do anything to win.

37:57.553 --> 37:59.420
Reminds me of me.

38:03.389 --> 38:04.892
BENNY: Good morning, Ms. Snyder.

38:04.894 --> 38:06.977
Isn't it true
that one of the major problems

38:06.979 --> 38:10.848
these clinical trials face
is recruiting subjects?

38:10.850 --> 38:14.602
I mean... I can't believe
that there's lots of people

38:14.604 --> 38:17.938
who are willing to put
untested drugs into their bodies

38:17.940 --> 38:19.940
for whatever you're willing to pay them.

38:19.942 --> 38:22.943
Well, it's certainly a lot easier

38:22.945 --> 38:25.079
to find subjects who suffer
from whatever condition

38:25.081 --> 38:26.460
we're trying to target.

38:27.416 --> 38:28.449
Yes.

38:28.915 --> 38:30.451
It can be incredibly difficult

38:30.453 --> 38:32.870
finding healthy volunteers.

38:32.872 --> 38:34.955
Truly healthy volunteers.

38:35.421 --> 38:38.959
BENNY: And yet, until this
drug, until this lawsuit,

38:38.961 --> 38:41.128
your company had a rare spotless record.

38:41.678 --> 38:43.806
None of the healthy volunteers

38:43.808 --> 38:45.349
in the 50 so years

38:45.351 --> 38:47.134
that the company
has been in existence ever...

38:47.517 --> 38:49.854
filed a claim or sought a settlement.

38:50.626 --> 38:52.857
Is that why you decided
to hide the other suicide

38:52.859 --> 38:54.441
amongst the ten healthy volunteers?

38:54.443 --> 38:56.026
(SHOCKED MURMURING)

39:00.099 --> 39:01.365
I love that sound.

39:01.367 --> 39:03.450
Me, too.

39:03.452 --> 39:05.319
I have no idea what you're talking about.

39:05.321 --> 39:08.205
Well, does the name
Edgar Paulson ring a bell?

39:10.790 --> 39:13.160
Edgar Paulson?

39:13.162 --> 39:15.079
A 62-year-old homeless man

39:15.081 --> 39:17.331
with dubious mental acuity

39:17.333 --> 39:20.167
who, up until the point
that he hung himself,

39:20.169 --> 39:23.386
was living at the Light
Mission Homeless Shelter?

39:24.345 --> 39:26.557
Is that Dep Pharmaceutical's idea

39:26.559 --> 39:28.509
of a healthy volunteer?

39:29.578 --> 39:31.744
MARISSA: Things are looking
greener and greener over here.

39:32.562 --> 39:34.272
I think you're mistaken.

39:35.523 --> 39:37.985
Mr. Paulson was in absolutely fine...

39:37.987 --> 39:40.688
physical and mental shape.

39:40.690 --> 39:43.240
He had fallen on hard times financially,

39:43.242 --> 39:45.576
and that had taken a toll
on his disposition.

39:45.578 --> 39:48.445
But from a purely clinical standpoint,

39:48.447 --> 39:50.581
Mr. Paulson was an ideal subject.

39:50.583 --> 39:54.368
Additionally, he finished
the trial successfully.

39:55.001 --> 39:57.371
Anything that may
have befallen him after that...

39:57.373 --> 39:58.873
Six days after that?

39:58.875 --> 40:00.541
Again, Mr. Paulson

40:00.543 --> 40:04.545
suffered from crushing
financial problems.

40:05.053 --> 40:07.715
I can only speculate that that
may be why he took his own life.

40:08.139 --> 40:10.725
- There's no causation there.
- Ah.

40:11.701 --> 40:13.888
I guess we'll never know,
will we, Ms. Snyder?

40:13.890 --> 40:16.523
Since you conveniently paid
for the body to be cremated.

40:16.525 --> 40:17.775
(SHOCKED MURMURING)

40:17.777 --> 40:18.809
Objection.

40:18.811 --> 40:20.091
Relevance.

40:20.093 --> 40:22.029
Doesn't get more relevant than that.

40:22.031 --> 40:25.399
But please ask the witness a question

40:25.401 --> 40:27.985
as opposed to simply making a statement.

40:27.987 --> 40:30.788
Yes. Ms. Snyder,

40:31.079 --> 40:33.657
did you or did you not

40:33.659 --> 40:36.493
arrange for the cremation
of Mr. Edgar Paulson

40:36.918 --> 40:39.046
once you realized he had killed himself

40:39.048 --> 40:42.049
after a one month course
of your new drug?

40:44.053 --> 40:46.420
(WHISPERING)

40:47.637 --> 40:48.889
Ms. Snyder?

40:50.927 --> 40:52.476
BULL: Three...

40:53.935 --> 40:55.429
two...

40:56.983 --> 40:58.399
...one.

41:00.403 --> 41:03.437
Your Honor, would it be possible
to ask for a brief recess

41:03.439 --> 41:05.105
so the sides could meet privately

41:05.107 --> 41:06.573
for a short discussion?

41:06.575 --> 41:08.943
Can you say "settlement"?

41:08.945 --> 41:11.245
JUDGE: This court will take
a 90 minute recess.

41:11.247 --> 41:12.613

41:34.600 --> 41:36.136
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- BULL: Oh.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.440
There you are.

41:39.442 --> 41:41.725
- Here I am.
- ‭Oh.

41:41.727 --> 41:44.812
- Miss?
- Uh, your oldest Scotch. Neat.

41:44.814 --> 41:46.447
And a glass of water, please.

41:46.449 --> 41:47.982
- Okay.
- ‭(CHUCKLES)

41:47.984 --> 41:49.650
(SIGHS)

41:49.652 --> 41:51.618
You read my mind.

41:51.620 --> 41:53.904
But, then again, that's what you do.

41:54.370 --> 41:56.373
And you do it very well, by the way.

41:59.834 --> 42:01.712
I, uh...

42:03.713 --> 42:05.798
I need you to know something.

42:07.008 --> 42:09.067
I didn't bribe that friend of Simon's.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.504
I'm not saying

42:10.506 --> 42:12.973
that I didn't sense that
something might be afoot, but...

42:12.975 --> 42:15.092
I need you to know something.

42:16.017 --> 42:18.929
In the same way you inferred,
without saying as much,

42:18.931 --> 42:21.181
that Simon attempted suicide
with heroin...

42:21.183 --> 42:24.401
even though I strongly suspect
that's not what happened...

42:26.110 --> 42:27.602
Benny and I

42:27.604 --> 42:31.075
decided to infer a little something

42:31.077 --> 42:33.410
that we had no way of knowing was true.

42:34.077 --> 42:35.362
Maybe someone bribed him.

42:35.364 --> 42:37.288
Maybe someone didn't.

42:38.748 --> 42:40.200
We took a shot.

42:42.088 --> 42:43.586
Thank you.

42:46.214 --> 42:48.092
Great minds.

42:48.466 --> 42:50.210
Here's to seeing you again.

42:50.212 --> 42:51.879
Knowing better next time.

42:52.428 --> 42:53.514
I already rue the day.
