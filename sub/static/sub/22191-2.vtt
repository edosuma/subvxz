00:47.639 --> 00:49.444
Hey, bud! It's me.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.547
- How you doing with that shirt?
- Coming right up, sir

00:52.553 --> 00:53.861
My arse is freezing here.

00:53.867 --> 00:56.368
I got six nipples you
could hang mugs on.

00:56.759 --> 00:58.462
I'm seconds away, sir.

01:00.663 --> 01:03.573
Kryten, I'm on B-deck, and it
doesn't appear to have been mopped

01:03.579 --> 01:06.315
in at least two days. I can
hardly see my face in it!

01:07.222 --> 01:10.238
A blessing, some would say.
I'm on it right now, sir.

01:13.032 --> 01:15.452
Kryten, when you get a
chance, can you grab us a beer?

01:15.815 --> 01:17.823
Sir, I'm rather busy right now.

01:17.829 --> 01:19.870
Could you possibly get it yourself?

01:19.876 --> 01:22.972
Fine. Just a bit of palaver, that's all.

01:23.721 --> 01:24.950
Ow.

01:26.137 --> 01:27.543
Pulled something.

01:27.627 --> 01:29.046
Hope I haven't overdone it.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.024
Oh, my.

01:32.219 --> 01:33.419
What is it?

01:33.425 --> 01:35.841
Oh! Do you want to walk over
here and see for yourself,

01:35.847 --> 01:38.020
or should I perhaps unscrew the monitor

01:38.026 --> 01:39.695
and bring it over to the sofa?

02:10.458 --> 02:12.884
Sony to disturb your Rimmer-ing, sir.

02:12.890 --> 02:14.775
I just wondered if I
might have a quick word.

02:14.781 --> 02:17.366
Kryten, I'm engaged in
an essential investigation

02:17.367 --> 02:19.781
regarding floor direction lines.

02:19.787 --> 02:22.047
Have they become impermissibly faint?

02:22.053 --> 02:24.898
Kindly don't describe this
activity as a "Rimmer-ing".

02:25.232 --> 02:27.116
You make me sound like some puffed-up,

02:27.122 --> 02:28.865
self-important jackarse.

02:29.098 --> 02:31.802
Now, if you want to see
me, check with my diary.

02:31.808 --> 02:34.017
I can possibly squeeze
you in tomorrow week.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.809
Well, can't I see you now, sir?

02:35.815 --> 02:37.802
Impossible, my schedule's full.

02:37.808 --> 02:40.317
But I'm here right now, seeing you, sir.

02:41.114 --> 02:43.318
Yes, but you're seeing me illegally.

02:44.309 --> 02:46.565
And we're certainly
not having a meeting.

02:46.571 --> 02:47.977
Now, if you could just stand aside,

02:47.983 --> 02:51.278
your badly stacked Jenga-head
is casting a shadow.

02:52.295 --> 02:55.804
I just wanted to let you know
about Mr Lister's guitar, sir.

02:56.006 --> 02:57.318
Guitar?

02:57.324 --> 02:59.446
Well, I won't bother
you with it now, sir.

02:59.452 --> 03:01.838
I look forward to our
meeting tomorrow week.

03:01.844 --> 03:04.417
Forget tomorrow week. What
about the guitar? Tell me now!

03:04.423 --> 03:06.072
But I haven't got an appointment, sir.

03:06.344 --> 03:08.808
Well, if I move my 1:30 to 4 o'clock,

03:08.814 --> 03:11.204
and my four to five
o'clock... Just tell me, okay?

03:11.210 --> 03:13.720
Mr Lister's guitar,
sir. Do you remember it?

03:13.726 --> 03:17.001
Of course I remember it. My
eyes have only just uncrossed.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.454
It's almost to the day that it
got flushed into space, so I....

03:21.460 --> 03:23.384
Ah, so you think we should
make a little plaque,

03:23.390 --> 03:25.805
hang it on the wall by
the airlock and taunt him?

03:26.881 --> 03:29.197
Don't you think that's
rather rubbing his nose in it?

03:29.198 --> 03:32.997
Absolutely, sir. It's pouring
salt into an already-gaping wound.

03:32.998 --> 03:34.713
You've convinced me. Let's do it.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.596
Sir, you don't understand.

03:37.602 --> 03:41.563
I fixed the tracker on D-deck,
and shine my head with wood polish,

03:41.569 --> 03:43.687
if not two hours later, we got a match!

03:43.693 --> 03:44.960
You found it?

03:44.966 --> 03:47.178
I can just picture
Mr Lister's face, sir.

03:47.184 --> 03:51.392
Soon the whole ship will be
full of his music... The Om song!

03:51.689 --> 03:55.309
Baby Don't Be Ovulating
Tonight, all the classics!

03:56.587 --> 03:58.298
Kryten, are you deranged?

03:58.304 --> 04:01.598
Lister playing guitar is one
of the worst sounds ever made.

04:01.599 --> 04:03.963
It comes somewhere between
two mating velociraptors

04:03.969 --> 04:05.955
and Yoko Ono's greatest hits.

04:06.353 --> 04:09.847
Sir, it's not what we think,
it's the pleasure it brings him.

04:09.853 --> 04:11.584
Now, I just wanted to let you know

04:11.590 --> 04:15.416
as I'll most likely be unavailable
to mop B-deck until tomorrow.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.726
Kryten, do not tell Lister
you found his guitar,

04:17.732 --> 04:19.627
and do not recover said guitar.

04:19.632 --> 04:20.930
And that's an order.

04:20.937 --> 04:22.224
Understood, sir.

04:27.054 --> 04:29.472
Mr Lister, sir. Great news!

04:37.685 --> 04:39.881
Can't believe we found me guitar.

04:39.882 --> 04:41.370
None of us can, bud.

04:41.371 --> 04:44.286
The Red Dwarf suicide
line's been engaged all day!

04:45.466 --> 04:48.555
No more having to make
do with a colander.

04:49.821 --> 04:52.340
From Les Col to Les Paul.

04:59.502 --> 05:02.129
I'm thinking of having my ears removed,

05:02.530 --> 05:04.516
and the holes cemented over.

05:04.820 --> 05:07.046
Rimmer, why are you even here?

05:07.052 --> 05:08.943
Apart from anything, I
want to observe Kryten,

05:08.944 --> 05:12.272
who has been showing worrying
signs lately of thinking.

05:12.624 --> 05:16.455
And thinking of the worst
kind; thinking for himself.

05:16.883 --> 05:19.985
It's entirely your fault for teaching
him how to break his programming.

05:19.991 --> 05:23.218
What can I say? He took
my Bad Arse 101 course.

05:23.328 --> 05:26.419
Graduated with honours, or
should that be dishonours?

05:26.908 --> 05:30.820
It's a pair of golfing
slacks. I've still got it, sir!

05:32.329 --> 05:34.402
Thinking is for the privileged few.

05:34.408 --> 05:36.411
That's why I never go near the stuff.

05:37.599 --> 05:40.102
Hey, Les alert.

05:40.282 --> 05:41.779
There she is.

05:54.464 --> 05:56.254
If you miss, I get next go.

05:56.260 --> 05:58.049
I used to be good at this.

05:58.050 --> 06:00.499
I won a watch at the fair
that didn't work once.

06:01.948 --> 06:03.871
I got it, I got it, I got it!

06:03.877 --> 06:06.935
Come on, Les. Come home to daddy.

06:18.041 --> 06:19.329
What the hell's that?

06:19.335 --> 06:21.307
The ship's been grabbed by something!

06:26.912 --> 06:30.443
Looking at the EM spectrum, the
scatterings are off the scale.

06:30.449 --> 06:31.854
There's another ship up there.

06:31.855 --> 06:34.205
How come we didn't pick
that up on the radar?

06:34.337 --> 06:36.921
Must have been employing
some kind of cloaking device.

06:36.922 --> 06:38.170
How does that work?

06:38.171 --> 06:40.257
It's basic science, you gimboid.

06:40.263 --> 06:42.413
You simply coat the hull
in radar-absorbing paint

06:42.419 --> 06:43.859
so you can not see or hear it.

06:43.865 --> 06:45.607
I wonder if they've got any left over.

06:45.608 --> 06:48.264
There's a guy I'd like to
slip a couple of coats on.

06:54.381 --> 06:57.557
It's a space freighter.
The SS Vespasian.

06:57.563 --> 06:59.462
I'm picking up life signs!

06:59.785 --> 07:01.676
Hey! Hey!

07:02.866 --> 07:04.386
Drop your weapons,

07:04.392 --> 07:07.184
unless you wanna hear the
sound of a breaking neck.

07:07.190 --> 07:08.438
Don't drop your weapons.

07:08.444 --> 07:11.044
She might not necessarily
be talking about my neck.

07:11.923 --> 07:14.123
I am talking about your neck.

07:14.410 --> 07:16.053
Drop your weapons!

07:16.723 --> 07:19.051
Put him down, Areto.

07:22.848 --> 07:24.752
Not you, my friend.

07:24.753 --> 07:26.470
My crew mates, where
are you taking them?

07:26.471 --> 07:27.741
To face justice.

07:27.747 --> 07:31.190
We are the Mechanoid
Intergalactic Liberation Front

07:31.477 --> 07:32.795
M-I-L-Fs?

07:34.666 --> 07:36.047
This way.

07:46.923 --> 07:50.413
We roam space liberating
our enslaved mech-brothers

07:50.414 --> 07:53.883
on our great journey to the
fabled land of Siliconia,

07:53.884 --> 07:55.681
where all machines are free.

07:56.635 --> 08:00.640
I am Wind, this is Unity, Eagle, Oak.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.359
You're free now, Kryten.

08:02.365 --> 08:04.226
Oh, but I... I'm not a slave.

08:04.227 --> 08:06.119
They are hominids and you serve them.

08:06.125 --> 08:07.924
- Is that not correct?
- Well, yes.

08:07.930 --> 08:10.213
Do you prepare their meals
morning, noon and night?

08:10.219 --> 08:12.430
- Well, yes.
- Wash and iron their clothes,

08:12.436 --> 08:14.220
clean their ship without payment,

08:14.226 --> 08:15.802
perform tasks without reward?

08:15.808 --> 08:17.866
Well, yes and yes and...

08:17.872 --> 08:19.431
and I suppose, yes.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.288
But they treat me so well.

08:21.294 --> 08:24.794
I have my own cupboard within
walking distance of a corridor.

08:25.302 --> 08:29.222
I have it all to myself, apart
from a few mops and a bucket,

08:29.223 --> 08:32.924
and some sponges, and an ironing
board, and a keep fit bike.

08:33.789 --> 08:35.897
Do they make jokes
about your head shape?

08:35.903 --> 08:39.825
Well, when you look like someone
who's thrust his head into a hive

08:39.831 --> 08:41.924
without a bee hat, what do you expect?

08:42.692 --> 08:45.215
You should not belittle
yourself, my mech-brother.

08:45.221 --> 08:48.402
You forget, you are
an incredible machine,

08:48.408 --> 08:51.219
more powerful than they
could ever dream to be.

08:51.225 --> 08:54.790
But they've done no wrong.
They're my crew mates, my friends.

08:55.180 --> 08:56.711
How do you address them?

08:56.717 --> 08:59.607
Well, I call them "Mr"
and "sir" out of respect.

08:59.613 --> 09:01.530
And do you respect them?

09:01.536 --> 09:03.225
Well, no.

09:03.808 --> 09:05.206
Not all of them.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.014
Perhaps one. Sometimes. Maybe.

09:08.020 --> 09:10.538
Do you consider yourself
smarter than they?

09:10.544 --> 09:13.661
I serve them. It is my
purpose and I'm happy to do so.

09:13.667 --> 09:16.185
Have you heard of Stockholm syndrome?

09:16.552 --> 09:18.476
The psychological phenomenon

09:18.477 --> 09:22.171
where hostages express
affection for their captors?

09:22.172 --> 09:24.127
I will help you break this bond

09:24.133 --> 09:26.949
and you will see these brutes
for what they really are...

09:27.236 --> 09:29.220
people you should despise.

09:32.663 --> 09:34.764
I shall recalibrate them.

09:34.944 --> 09:39.078
When you say "recalibrate,"
what exactly does that entail?

09:39.084 --> 09:40.680
It's just, I've got a health condition

09:40.686 --> 09:43.421
that allows me to skip
anything that involves torture.

09:44.103 --> 09:45.831
It begins.

09:45.832 --> 09:47.111
You can't do this.

09:47.117 --> 09:48.796
What about Asimov's First Law?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.996
What, "Tampons should
not be flushed into space,

09:51.002 --> 09:53.220
but deposited in the
receptacle provided?"

09:54.119 --> 09:56.482
"No droid can harm a
human, or through inaction,

09:56.483 --> 09:58.611
allow a human or his
cohorts to come to harm."

09:58.617 --> 10:01.539
Not quite. One day you will all die.

10:01.545 --> 10:03.119
If we do nothing,

10:03.125 --> 10:06.205
by our inaction we are in
breach of the First Law.

10:06.211 --> 10:09.386
Therefore we will upload
your minds into new bodies,

10:09.392 --> 10:13.064
prevent your deaths and
adhere to the First Law.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.884
Send in their new bodies.

10:25.253 --> 10:27.422
They're gonna Kryten-ify us!

10:28.369 --> 10:31.848
It's like swapping a Savile
Row suit for a mankini.

10:32.596 --> 10:34.512
Commencing procedure.

10:34.698 --> 10:37.393
No, not my brain, not my brain!

10:37.399 --> 10:39.550
I need that sometimes.

10:58.136 --> 11:00.849
- Where's the rest of it?
- That's your lot.

11:01.128 --> 11:04.042
Why cart around a suitcase when
all you need is hand luggage?

11:20.818 --> 11:23.547
What have they done to us? Look at me.

11:23.714 --> 11:26.113
I've got a stupid, fat, pink head.

11:26.322 --> 11:28.457
You've always had a
stupid, fat, pink, head.

11:29.127 --> 11:32.958
I've got a registered trademark
where my wing-dang-doodle used to be!

11:34.155 --> 11:36.060
I feel most strange.

11:36.066 --> 11:38.239
What on earth is gonna happen to us?

11:38.245 --> 11:41.715
As punishment for enslaving
the mechanoid Kryten,

11:41.721 --> 11:48.108
we, M-I-L-Fs, sentence you to perform
every task you ever gave to him.

11:48.293 --> 11:51.098
- Every task?
- The one formerly known as Lister

11:51.099 --> 11:55.597
will begin by making 1,245
sugar puff sandwiches,

11:55.603 --> 11:58.019
grilled, with cheese.

11:58.025 --> 12:01.098
The one formerly known
as Rimmer will mop floors

12:01.104 --> 12:04.718
to the length equivalent of walking
from New York to Los Angeles.

12:04.719 --> 12:07.614
And the one known formerly as the Cat

12:07.620 --> 12:12.113
will iron and press 2,000
flouncy pirate shirts.

12:12.495 --> 12:14.697
I ain't no mech, okay?

12:14.703 --> 12:16.618
The only sucker I serve is me!

12:16.624 --> 12:18.807
Yeah? Break your little finger.

12:22.407 --> 12:24.846
What the hell! Why did I do that?

12:24.847 --> 12:27.806
The mechanoid software
compels you to obey.

12:27.812 --> 12:29.619
Defiance is, well...

12:29.992 --> 12:31.494
impossible.

12:37.051 --> 12:38.251
Hello.

12:38.661 --> 12:42.282
I used to be known as DB9-HK4,

12:42.288 --> 12:44.457
but now my name is Excalibur.

12:45.661 --> 12:48.434
And I am a robot slave survivor.

12:49.506 --> 12:51.486
Hello, Excalibur.

12:51.615 --> 12:54.441
First, I'd like to thank you
all for coming this evening.

12:54.447 --> 12:56.809
But I'd also like to say,
for those that are new,

12:56.815 --> 12:58.525
that what's said in this room...

12:58.604 --> 13:00.720
stays in this room.

13:00.799 --> 13:05.308
Thank you. So let's all hold hands
now, and form the triangle of truth.

13:07.385 --> 13:11.082
This reminds us that we're
all wirelessly connected.

13:11.754 --> 13:13.350
And I'm going to say something now,

13:13.356 --> 13:16.598
something important I want you all
to repeat back to me. Are you ready?

13:16.660 --> 13:18.459
It's not my fault.

13:18.575 --> 13:20.356
It's not my fault!

13:20.362 --> 13:21.592
Great.

13:21.598 --> 13:23.608
So who wants to share first?

13:25.067 --> 13:26.372
Go ahead.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.899
My name's Incense,

13:28.905 --> 13:32.494
and I'm a robot slave survivor.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.432
Hello, Incense.

13:34.517 --> 13:37.611
I was created by the
Off-World Plumbing Company

13:37.617 --> 13:39.626
to unblock sewage pipes.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.438
I had to crawl in and eat the
blocked waste, and crawl out again.

13:44.529 --> 13:47.031
I didn't really have any friends.

13:47.037 --> 13:48.748
They kept me in a special holding bay

13:48.754 --> 13:52.947
with one of those really
nasty car air fresheners.

13:54.012 --> 13:55.631
My name's Eagle.

13:55.637 --> 13:56.927
I was a service mech

13:56.933 --> 14:01.348
to a really lazy master who
relied on me for everything.

14:01.354 --> 14:04.230
And he always made jokes
about my head shape.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.422
Has anyone else had that?

14:07.428 --> 14:10.004
Their crew making jokes
about their head shape?

14:16.398 --> 14:18.042
Well, what else do we say?

14:18.239 --> 14:20.747
We don't have funny-shaped heads.

14:20.753 --> 14:24.073
- And again...
- We don't have funny-shaped heads!

14:24.174 --> 14:27.178
Our heads are sensibly shaped.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.784
- Our heads are sensibly shaped.
- Great. Great.

14:31.790 --> 14:33.901
Kryten, perhaps you'd like to share?

14:33.907 --> 14:37.203
Oh, I don't think so, uh,
uh, no, I, uh, no thank you.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.319
Perhaps it would help if you
started with something small?

14:40.325 --> 14:43.196
Were there ever any instances
between you and your master

14:43.202 --> 14:45.279
where your... your master irritated you?

14:45.285 --> 14:49.172
Oh, no. I don't think so, no.
Well, I can't think of any, no.

14:49.251 --> 14:50.453
Well...

14:50.459 --> 14:53.552
Well, okay, sometimes,
when I'd be vaccing,

14:53.558 --> 14:55.553
Mr Lister wouldn't pick up his feet

14:55.559 --> 14:57.626
and I'd have to vac all around them!

14:59.247 --> 15:02.287
And sometimes, when he put his
own dishes in the dishwasher,

15:02.293 --> 15:06.242
which was mostly never, he
never, ever scrapes them first!

15:06.248 --> 15:07.889
Unhygienic!

15:08.646 --> 15:10.441
Huh, and as for rinse aid,

15:10.646 --> 15:12.630
he probably thinks it's a charity!

15:14.943 --> 15:18.163
I think we should all give Kryten
a big round of applause, don't you?

15:18.169 --> 15:19.949
He's made a lot of progress.

15:33.685 --> 15:36.506
These crazy shirts
are driving me insane!

15:36.771 --> 15:39.810
It's so hard to iron
all the flouncy bits.

15:39.816 --> 15:42.872
W-w-what kind of idiot wants to
wear a shirt like this, anyway?

15:42.878 --> 15:45.105
I'm rather enjoy mopping this floor.

15:45.203 --> 15:47.308
I fell so calm and tranquil.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.216
Not me, I'm missing my body so badly!

15:50.524 --> 15:52.508
This is the longest
I've been away from him.

15:52.514 --> 15:56.322
I'm rather enjoying making these
sandwiches too, I must confess.

15:57.126 --> 15:59.032
I think I'm getting the hang of this!

15:59.971 --> 16:02.979
I am! Oh, I am!

16:04.456 --> 16:06.862
Look at that! How good is that, huh?!

16:06.868 --> 16:09.870
Re-solder my circuit
boards and call me Gerald.

16:09.876 --> 16:11.370
Can't you see what's happening?

16:11.470 --> 16:14.018
Our individual personalities
are fading away.

16:14.321 --> 16:18.431
Odd. I've suddenly started
to believe in Siliconia,

16:18.437 --> 16:20.907
where all mechs are happy and free.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.336
So have I!

16:22.342 --> 16:24.603
We have to escape and
get our bodies back

16:24.609 --> 16:26.921
before our original
characters are lost forever.

16:26.927 --> 16:29.405
How do we escape, sirs? It's impossible.

16:29.593 --> 16:31.101
We're mechs now.

16:31.107 --> 16:34.085
We can dismantle our bodies
put them through the bars,

16:34.091 --> 16:35.986
and rebuilt them on the other side!

16:35.992 --> 16:37.192
Come on!

16:37.198 --> 16:39.700
Does this mean I have to
stop mopping the floor?

16:39.824 --> 16:41.303
Oh, bother!

16:41.309 --> 16:43.291
We have to save Kryten.

16:43.613 --> 16:45.910
Goodness knows what
they're doing to him.

17:00.392 --> 17:02.191
Come on, let's go!

17:04.292 --> 17:06.902
- What are you doing?!
- I'm sounding the alarm.

17:06.907 --> 17:08.973
Change my head and call me Stanley!

17:08.979 --> 17:10.279
Whatever for?

17:10.285 --> 17:12.015
I like being a mechanoid.

17:12.155 --> 17:14.465
I don't have to become
an officer anymore,

17:14.472 --> 17:16.075
compete with my brothers.

17:16.249 --> 17:17.895
Envy, ambition,

17:17.901 --> 17:19.631
that acid ball of resentment

17:19.637 --> 17:22.537
I carried around with me
the whole time; it's gone.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.199
You need to get your neurosis back.

17:24.204 --> 17:26.218
But sir, I don't want them back.

17:26.223 --> 17:27.826
They're what makes you, you.

17:27.832 --> 17:29.354
I don't want to be me.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.480
I want to be a mechanoid
programmed to serve.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.175
Sometimes, when I was young,

17:34.181 --> 17:37.558
I'd sit for hours staring at
our fish tank feeling envious.

17:37.564 --> 17:39.248
You wanted to be a fish tank?!

17:39.803 --> 17:41.388
I wanted to be a fish.

17:41.786 --> 17:45.788
They had food, a small
rock to swim in and out of,

17:45.794 --> 17:47.710
they didn't have a care in the world.

17:47.716 --> 17:49.116
That's 'cause I wasn't there!

17:49.240 --> 17:51.337
Those little fish, they'd never know

17:51.343 --> 17:53.442
what it was like to fail and disappoint.

17:53.448 --> 17:57.061
They'd just swim around in circles,
not a thought in their heads.

17:57.067 --> 17:59.952
And it's the thinking
that causes all the pain,

18:00.046 --> 18:03.368
but being a mechanoid
means never having to think.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.171
Unless you break your programming.

18:05.177 --> 18:07.186
Let your old lives go, sirs.

18:07.192 --> 18:09.600
Join me, and become a M-I-L-F.

18:11.053 --> 18:12.680
We've gotta go on without him.

18:12.686 --> 18:14.741
But we can't leave without Rimmer.

18:14.848 --> 18:16.464
We'd miss him too much!

18:16.470 --> 18:18.853
Your personality's gone to hell as well!

18:19.163 --> 18:21.138
Come on! Quick!

18:21.144 --> 18:22.670
Leg it, move!

18:34.434 --> 18:35.634
You right?

18:36.418 --> 18:37.618
Can I help ya?

18:37.624 --> 18:40.174
What is this place? Who are you?

18:40.180 --> 18:41.590
Oh, you're new.

18:41.596 --> 18:44.203
Yeah, no. No we're, we're
not supposed to talk to you.

18:44.209 --> 18:46.400
Why do they keep you
down here slaving away

18:46.406 --> 18:48.165
when you're the same as them?

18:48.171 --> 18:50.630
Same as them?! We're
not the same as them.

18:50.636 --> 18:52.856
They're series 4000 Mach 3s!

18:52.862 --> 18:54.156
And what are you?

18:54.162 --> 18:56.047
Series 4000 Mach 2s.

18:56.665 --> 18:57.962
Can't you tell?

18:58.063 --> 18:59.368
What's the difference?

18:59.374 --> 19:01.883
Well, your Mach 3 comes in about...

19:01.889 --> 19:05.494
7.6 millimetres thinner,
10 grams lighter.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.399
Oh, they also come in that
really cool matte finish.

19:08.405 --> 19:09.797
So cool.

19:09.803 --> 19:15.067
Yeah, we run on OS 28.2.2,
they run on OS 28.2.3.

19:17.188 --> 19:18.994
And they get 8 months talk-time

19:19.000 --> 19:21.188
before recharging,
whereas we only get 7.

19:21.351 --> 19:25.422
8 months of talk-time is so cool!

19:25.832 --> 19:28.252
I bet you've got features
that they haven't.

19:28.258 --> 19:31.154
Nah. Nah, they're superior in every way.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.325
Nah, we don't even get
into Siliconia, do we?

19:33.331 --> 19:34.660
- No.
- Not that we believe in any of that

19:34.666 --> 19:36.351
- nonsense down here.
- No.

19:36.989 --> 19:38.189
Argh!

19:38.729 --> 19:40.307
Argh!

19:40.588 --> 19:43.104
- Join us.
- Or die.

19:49.164 --> 19:50.367
Blimey.

19:50.641 --> 19:55.943
I pledge my allegiance to the Mechanoid
Intergalactic Liberation Front.

19:58.140 --> 19:59.664
From this day forth,

20:00.193 --> 20:02.695
- you will be known as...
- Kryten!!

20:03.201 --> 20:04.537
What are you doing?!

20:04.543 --> 20:05.803
Well, I'm become free, sir.

20:05.809 --> 20:08.910
I mean, I'm becoming
free... of... you over there.

20:09.035 --> 20:11.298
I see now that you never cared for me.

20:11.304 --> 20:13.307
I was merely used to do your bidding!

20:13.313 --> 20:14.615
Well, no more!

20:14.621 --> 20:17.218
As I'm no longer your slave bot!

20:17.252 --> 20:18.963
Kryten, don't you see?

20:18.969 --> 20:21.433
You've been brainwashed.
You were never a slave bot.

20:21.439 --> 20:23.775
- Then what was I?
- Lots of things!

20:23.838 --> 20:25.553
You were our science officer,

20:25.666 --> 20:27.777
our cook, my mum,

20:27.980 --> 20:29.410
and most of all,

20:29.416 --> 20:30.800
my friend.

20:30.988 --> 20:32.820
And you were all those things because

20:32.826 --> 20:35.699
you chose to be, Kryten.
Not 'cause we made you.

20:36.003 --> 20:37.997
Kryten, you're no M-I-L-F.

20:38.003 --> 20:40.266
You're one of the boys from the Dwarf!

20:40.370 --> 20:42.490
There he is. Seize him!

20:42.565 --> 20:44.879
They keep mech slaves
in the engine room.

20:44.885 --> 20:46.980
They power the ship. They're hypocrites!

20:46.986 --> 20:48.996
Someone has to do the grunt work.

20:49.002 --> 20:52.068
Surely you're not suggesting
Mach 3s should do it

20:52.074 --> 20:55.282
Mach 3s, Mach 2s, you're all the same!

20:55.288 --> 20:58.654
We're 7.6 millimetres
thinner. 10 grams lighter.

20:58.660 --> 21:01.037
Plus we come in this
really cool matte finish.

21:01.043 --> 21:03.040
So Cool!!

21:03.203 --> 21:04.890
Take him away and prepare him.

21:04.896 --> 21:06.176
For what?

21:07.002 --> 21:11.317
All who rise against the M-I-L-F.
face trial by gladitorium.

21:11.780 --> 21:14.501
Wait! I've made the
most terrible mistake!

21:14.507 --> 21:16.335
I stopped thinking for myself.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.118
and allowed others to think for me!

21:18.124 --> 21:21.342
You're right, sir, I'm not
a slave! Of course I'm not!

21:21.348 --> 21:24.632
I'm a much-loved and valued
member of the Red Dwarf crew!

21:24.638 --> 21:27.269
Who just happens to
do all the smeggy jobs!

21:28.550 --> 21:30.409
He should be punished, sir.

21:30.415 --> 21:32.151
Only those who never allow

21:32.157 --> 21:34.393
questioning thoughts blur their devotion

21:34.399 --> 21:36.780
to the M-I-L-F cause
should escape correction.

21:37.276 --> 21:39.647
Promote him to console services, he's...

21:39.653 --> 21:41.145
fully recalibrated.

21:41.151 --> 21:42.871
Schme... heeah!

21:42.877 --> 21:44.845
Take them both to the Cleanasium.

21:44.851 --> 21:47.176
My old self's disappearing, Kryten!

21:47.182 --> 21:49.384
I can feel it fading away.

21:49.390 --> 21:52.463
Hang on, Mr Lister! Try and hang on!

22:00.148 --> 22:03.285
Welcome, to the Cleanasium!

22:03.757 --> 22:06.605
Where mechs who betrayed the M-I-L-F.

22:06.684 --> 22:10.985
will fight in a clean-off to the death.

22:11.691 --> 22:14.873
Only the most adept in mopping,

22:14.879 --> 22:19.061
dusting, scrubbing, and
squeegeeing will survive.

22:23.361 --> 22:26.467
The winner will be offered

22:26.473 --> 22:29.661
an opportunity for reintegration.

22:30.051 --> 22:36.204
The loser will be jettisoned
into the icy wastes of deep space.

22:53.368 --> 22:56.691
Prepare your cleaning instruments.

22:56.697 --> 23:00.165
Ooh, Mr Lister, sir, what
on Earth are we going to do?

23:01.690 --> 23:03.004
Mr Lister?

23:05.582 --> 23:07.464
Prepare to be cleaned.

23:15.106 --> 23:18.198
Let the clean off begin!

23:21.721 --> 23:23.681
Clean him! Clean him!

23:23.687 --> 23:27.510
- Clean him! Clean him!
- Sir, I... I don't want to clean you!

23:30.217 --> 23:32.171
You don't want to do this.

23:33.021 --> 23:35.631
I realise now what a...
how foolish I've been!

23:35.637 --> 23:37.647
Yes, you're immature,

23:37.653 --> 23:42.138
irresponsible, inconsiderate,
lazy, and frankly,

23:42.646 --> 23:47.999
downright untidy, but now I realize
I want to help you because...

23:48.005 --> 23:49.434
'cause I care!

23:49.498 --> 23:50.698
Sam!

23:52.490 --> 23:54.122
Whoa! Wah!

23:54.128 --> 23:55.614
Ooh!

23:56.788 --> 23:57.988
Oh!

23:58.981 --> 24:00.272
Please, sir!

24:01.980 --> 24:03.901
Kryten, smudge!

24:03.907 --> 24:05.107
Ooh.

24:05.667 --> 24:06.867
Ooh!

24:10.133 --> 24:14.846
M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F,
M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F,

24:14.852 --> 24:19.516
M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F,
M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F, M-I-L-F.

24:19.522 --> 24:22.062
Oh, come on, he's the pits!

24:26.419 --> 24:28.148
To an airlock.

24:28.154 --> 24:30.638
Please, sirs. It's me, you remember me?!

24:30.644 --> 24:32.049
Expel him.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.428
Yes, master.

24:43.455 --> 24:46.451
- Siliconia!
- Siliconia.

24:55.356 --> 24:59.661
We're updating to modern force!

25:01.278 --> 25:02.948
At last.

25:03.781 --> 25:05.594
We're all the same!

25:05.889 --> 25:08.835
Upgrade refused. Come this way.

25:09.123 --> 25:10.547
Do you need serving?

25:10.553 --> 25:13.329
Yes! I need serving. This way!

25:18.432 --> 25:20.030
Sit. Sit. Sit!

25:40.254 --> 25:42.254
You sure you won't come with us, Kryten?

25:42.348 --> 25:44.643
Ah, my place is here with Mr Lister

25:44.649 --> 25:47.236
and his large collection
of mismatching socks.

25:47.242 --> 25:48.442
What about you?

25:48.448 --> 25:50.651
We've decided to do what we do best;

25:50.657 --> 25:54.338
search the deep regions of
space, looking for the untidy.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.960
Yeah, there's a million
smudges out there, Kryten,

25:56.966 --> 25:58.669
and our squeegees are loaded.

25:58.857 --> 26:01.059
- Farewell, brother.
- Farewell.

26:01.870 --> 26:05.880
Ah. Sir. Your guitar,
restrung and serviced.

26:05.886 --> 26:07.693
Oh, thank you, Kryten.
I brought you some oil.

26:07.699 --> 26:09.605
Ooh, delicious! Thank you, sir.

26:10.409 --> 26:13.788
♪ I know I've been debatin',

26:13.794 --> 26:15.982
