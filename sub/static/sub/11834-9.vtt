LINDSAY DOLE: <i>Previously</i>
<i>on "The Practice"...</i>

00:03.136 --> 00:05.405
If I could have figured out
a way to dismember them alive,

00:05.438 --> 00:07.641
I would have done so.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.744
All nine victims had dogs.
Mr. Hinks met all of them

00:10.777 --> 00:14.180
in various parks and streets
while walking his dog.

00:14.214 --> 00:17.150
My opinion is Mr. Hinks
is suffering from delusions.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.553
Basically, he thinks
he killed those women.

00:19.586 --> 00:20.821
He did not.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.056
Your honor, I seek
to discharge counsel.

00:23.089 --> 00:25.325
She is soliciting false
testimony from this witness.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.460
Your doctors discovered
you're delusional.

00:27.493 --> 00:29.730
You're just an anonymous
little man who had nothing --

00:29.763 --> 00:32.398
I killed those women.
I did it!

00:32.432 --> 00:35.802
Mr. Hinks needed this therapist
to sell you,

00:35.836 --> 00:38.672
and in order to keep her
convinced enough,

00:38.705 --> 00:41.174
he had to keep insisting
that he did it,

00:41.207 --> 00:45.311
all the while needing a lawyer
who would say otherwise

00:45.345 --> 00:47.313
over his feigned protests.

00:47.347 --> 00:49.215
His closing was good,
wasn't it?

00:49.249 --> 00:50.717
He kind of sold me.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.286
Did you know I planned
to yank the insanity plea

00:53.319 --> 00:56.322
and go straight
not guilty?

00:56.356 --> 00:58.725
I had a pretty good idea.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.595
We find the defendant
William Hinks...

01:01.628 --> 01:03.396
not guilty.

01:03.429 --> 01:07.200
(gallery reacts loudly)

01:07.233 --> 01:09.402
You're about to lose
your job.

01:09.435 --> 01:11.404
Now you're hit
with losing your wife.

01:11.437 --> 01:13.740
You weren't going to let that
happen, were you, Mr. Wallace?

01:13.774 --> 01:15.475
-You snapped.
-But that's not the way
it happened --

01:15.509 --> 01:16.710
-You killed your wife --
-I did not!

01:16.743 --> 01:18.612
Did you kill your wife?

01:18.645 --> 01:20.413
No.

01:20.446 --> 01:24.250
We find the defendant
Scott Wallace not guilty.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.255
What's the concern?

01:29.289 --> 01:31.157
Well, if you plan
to take a full maternity,

01:31.191 --> 01:32.325
which you know
I'm required by law

01:32.358 --> 01:34.528
not only to support
but applaud,

01:34.561 --> 01:35.829
I'd just like to --

01:35.862 --> 01:37.330
Well, is Lindsay?

01:37.363 --> 01:39.132
Probably, yes, which means
if you also plan to,

01:39.165 --> 01:40.834
I got to think about hiring.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.169
No, we ordered 2-inch.

01:43.203 --> 01:47.741
Okay, well, I'm measuring
them at 1 1/2, so...

01:47.774 --> 01:51.645
Francis Lupino.
I got to see Bobby.

01:51.678 --> 01:52.779
Okay, one sec.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.214
It's urgent.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.251
Mm-hmm. Okay --

01:58.284 --> 01:59.419
(hangs up telephone)

01:59.452 --> 02:03.356
I gotta see Bobby.
It's important.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.328
Francis?

02:08.360 --> 02:12.398
Cops came to my house,

02:12.432 --> 02:14.400
and yesterday
there was this car.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.770
It was following me.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.339
I think I'm taking
a surveillance.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.375
Okay, look--

02:22.408 --> 02:25.712
It's not okay.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.914
I need your advice,
counselor.

02:27.948 --> 02:31.251
You been watching
the news?

02:31.284 --> 02:33.386
The kidnapping?
That little girl?

02:33.419 --> 02:35.922
The Engel girl?

02:35.956 --> 02:37.891
Trevor Engel's kid?

02:37.924 --> 02:40.661
The ransom?
That little girl?

02:42.563 --> 02:45.331
I know something
about it.

02:47.433 --> 02:48.935
What do you know?

02:51.972 --> 02:54.575
I know where she is.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.714
Where?

03:02.448 --> 03:04.818
Locked up.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.588
Is she alive?

03:10.323 --> 03:11.625
Should be.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.432
Okay. Look,
I can go to the FBI.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.334
You won't have to contact
them yourself --

03:21.367 --> 03:23.469
You keep my name
out of it, right?

03:23.504 --> 03:25.271
-I can't promise that --
-No, you promise that.

03:25.305 --> 03:26.607
That is what
I'm in here for.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.974
Francis, you can't blow
in here and tell me this

03:28.008 --> 03:29.643
and start tearing into me,
you got that?

03:41.655 --> 03:44.457
What if I bring you
to where she is...

03:46.860 --> 03:49.696
let you take over
from there?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.903
â™ª (theme)

04:46.920 --> 04:48.622
You can't go with him.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.524
I know, but this is
a little kid.

04:50.557 --> 04:51.525
What am I supposed to do?

04:51.558 --> 04:53.459
This is not
what lawyers do.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.061
Best case, you're a witness
against your own client.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.330
Worse case, the cops
see you two together,

04:57.363 --> 04:58.832
they arrest you
on conspiracy.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.067
Eugene,
she could be alive.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.537
He won't tell you
where she is?

05:03.570 --> 05:04.938
I've been grilling him
for 10 minutes.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.707
He doesn't want
to give anything up.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.909
You know Francis.
He has to be in control.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.711
If he won't cooperate
with you,

05:10.744 --> 05:12.846
you can withdraw
and let the cops handle it.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.380
-That's not going to
help that girl, and --
-LUCY: You can't go in there.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.716
FRANCIS: What's going on?
Where's Bobby? Bobby!

05:15.749 --> 05:16.850
What the hell is that?

05:16.883 --> 05:17.918
FRANCIS:
All right, take it easy!

05:17.951 --> 05:19.085
Mirandize him.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.087
Francis Lupino, you're
under arrest

05:21.121 --> 05:22.989
for the kidnapping
of Alessa Engel.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.991
What's going on? You have
no right to bust in like this.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.760
-You have no right
to harbor a kidnapping.
-Do you even have a warrant?

05:26.793 --> 05:28.529
-Don't lecture me.
-Just give me
10 minutes to talk to him.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.597
Talk to him at
the arraignment. Let's go.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.798
Bobby: Richard!
Don't say anything, Francis.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.899
I'll meet you
at the courthouse.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.367
Do not say a word!

05:34.400 --> 05:35.902
-Bobby.
-Scott?

05:35.936 --> 05:38.138
-Can I see you?
-Um, I'm actually --

05:38.171 --> 05:39.873
-They fired me.
-What? Who?

05:39.906 --> 05:41.474
Harry Duvall.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.043
Bobby, they'll arraign him
as soon as he gets there.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.512
-Scott, can we talk later?
-I've been there
for 18 years --

05:45.546 --> 05:46.747
Hold on a second.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.048
I want you to talk
to one of my partners.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.683
I need you.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.618
Scott, I have an emergency.
Go in the conference room.

05:51.652 --> 05:52.919
A partner will be
right with you.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.123
Ellenor, Jimmy,

05:57.157 --> 05:58.825
deal with Scott,
whatever he needs. Ready?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.160
Let's go.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.395
LUCY: Donnell, Dole,
Young, and Frutt.

06:02.428 --> 06:05.098
Lindsay, are you here
for William Hinks?

06:05.131 --> 06:06.867
He's on two.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.672
I'm not here.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.107
I'm sorry. She's unavailable.

06:14.140 --> 06:17.110
Um, can I have her
get back to you?

06:17.143 --> 06:19.746
No, I'm not sure
when she's going to return,

06:19.780 --> 06:22.115
but, you know,
the best thing for you to do

06:22.148 --> 06:26.119
would be to leave your number,
and I'll have her call you back.

06:26.152 --> 06:30.056
555-0171? Okey-dokey. Bye.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.601
Don't they have
to have cause?

06:40.634 --> 06:42.869
I mean, I'm a partner,
for God's sake.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.171
I mean, I wasn't even
afforded due process.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.140
You were voted out
by the other partners?

06:47.173 --> 06:49.142
Evidently,
but they're like sheep.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.144
I mean, Harry calls
all the plays.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.714
And the reason
they gave you?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.081
"It's not working out."

06:55.115 --> 06:58.719
After 18 years,
that's all they gave me.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.987
"It's not working out."

07:01.021 --> 07:04.891
Okay, look, without having read
your partnership agreement,

07:04.925 --> 07:06.693
if it's anything like
a law firm agreement,

07:06.727 --> 07:09.530
partners pretty much
have blanket discretion.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.731
If they don't like you, they --

07:10.764 --> 07:12.465
No, no, no, no.
No, this just --

07:12.498 --> 07:13.534
Scott --

07:13.567 --> 07:15.536
Ms. Frutt,
now, let's face it.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.938
No other brokerage firm
is ever going to hire me.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.541
To the outside world,
I am a murderer

07:20.574 --> 07:21.942
with a good lawyer.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.678
I need to keep
my job here.

07:24.711 --> 07:27.814
Then let us try to meet
with Mr. Duvall and his attorney

07:27.848 --> 07:31.184
and see if we can work
something out.

07:31.217 --> 07:34.788
Fine.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.097
Bobby Donnell for
the defendant, your honor.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.666
Waive reading,
plead not guilty.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.233
Richard Bay
for the Commonwealth.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.670
Oppose bail, ask for
a finding of dangerousness.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.204
On what basis?

07:51.237 --> 07:53.507
This was a heinous crime,
your honor.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.576
Three days ago, the defendant
kidnapped a 7-year-old girl

07:55.609 --> 07:57.043
and has been holding her
for ransom.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.579
She may still be alive.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.614
I'd ask the court
to inquire

08:00.647 --> 08:02.516
as to what evidence
Mr. Bay has

08:02.549 --> 08:03.984
to justify arresting
my client in the first place.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.719
The defendant
is a career criminal.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.220
He's spent 15 years
in prison.

08:07.253 --> 08:08.855
Old news.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.857
His van matches one
that was seen speeding away

08:10.891 --> 08:12.859
from the galleria parking lot

08:12.893 --> 08:14.961
just after Alessa Engel
was kidnapped.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.263
A security video camera
puts the defendant at the mall

08:17.297 --> 08:19.866
10 minutes
before the girl was taken.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.268
Your honor, I understand
the gravity of the charges,

08:22.302 --> 08:24.871
but the Commonwealth has
no case against my client.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.873
The van could match
thousands.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.075
Shopping in a mall
is not a crime,

08:29.109 --> 08:31.645
and my client's priors
are inadmissible at trial.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.914
This is pretty thin,
Mr. Bay...

08:35.649 --> 08:37.618
but I'll make
a preliminary finding

08:37.650 --> 08:38.985
of probable cause.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.721
He's held without bail

08:40.754 --> 08:42.155
pending
a dangerousness hearing

08:42.188 --> 08:43.990
three days from now.
Next case.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.159
(pounds gavel)

08:46.192 --> 08:48.662
I'll meet you downstairs
in a half-hour.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.633
Man: Is the Engel girl
still alive?

08:52.666 --> 08:54.935
Mr. Donnell, would you
comment on the judge's ruling?

08:54.968 --> 08:56.269
No comment. No comment.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.839
-Mr. Donnell?
-Mrs. Engel.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.107
Please, Mr. Donnell.
Please, just look at this.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.043
Mrs. Engel, I'm truly sorry
about your daughter, but --

09:03.076 --> 09:04.745
Alessa -- That's her name,
Mr. Donnell.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.279
I understand
how you're feeling.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.048
Eugene: Bobby, let's go.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.651
She's in the second grade.
She's in a school play today,

09:10.684 --> 09:12.052
but they had to cancel it

09:12.085 --> 09:13.920
because she's not there,
Mr. Donnell.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.321
Please, if you know
where she is...

09:15.355 --> 09:17.591
Hillary,
what are you doing?

09:17.624 --> 09:20.594
We made this costume last week.
We sewed it together.

09:20.627 --> 09:24.330
Please, Mr. Donnell.
If you know where she is...

09:29.703 --> 09:34.140
(telephone rings)

09:34.174 --> 09:37.243
Who's got
your private line?

09:37.277 --> 09:39.613
Bobby.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.815
Why aren't
you answering it?

09:41.848 --> 09:43.717
Because...

09:46.086 --> 09:47.320
Hi.

09:47.353 --> 09:49.222
HINKS: Hi.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.957
Who is this?

09:50.991 --> 09:52.793
It's William.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.795
Are you available now?

09:54.828 --> 09:58.699
Well, actually, I --

09:58.732 --> 10:00.266
What is this about?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.703
I've been thinking
about the verdict.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.338
I've decided
I want to appeal.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.340
You were acquitted,
William.

10:07.373 --> 10:11.077
Yes, I'd like
that overturned.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.947
Well, I don't handle
acquittal appeals,

10:13.980 --> 10:15.081
so you'll have to get
another lawyer for that.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.351
I'm sorry.

10:18.384 --> 10:22.355
Okay, that was weird.

10:22.388 --> 10:24.257
Where are you going?

10:24.290 --> 10:25.859
To see Jeannie.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.294
I mean, this is just getting
a little out of control.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.395
Aah!

10:29.429 --> 10:31.331
(gasps)

10:32.899 --> 10:34.968
Is now not good?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.371
What do you want?

10:38.404 --> 10:43.276
I have some probate work,
and you're my attorney.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.111
I'm a criminal defense
lawyer.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.680
I don't do probate.

10:46.713 --> 10:49.015
What are you saying?

10:49.049 --> 10:51.017
Our relationship
is in jeopardy

10:51.051 --> 10:53.319
unless I commit a crime?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.231
I could have found her.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.700
What are you
talking about?

11:06.733 --> 11:08.334
I could have found
the girl.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.370
-Alessa.
-No, you couldn't --

11:10.403 --> 11:12.072
I could have gotten him
to take me to her.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.340
In which case you'd be locked
down with Francis right now.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.176
She's alive.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.478
Your only obligation
is to Francis.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.447
How could you
look at it that way?

11:21.481 --> 11:24.017
We have to look
at it that way,

11:24.050 --> 11:26.352
and I don't need
to tell you that.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.854
Did you question him?

11:27.888 --> 11:29.189
He lawyered up
immediately.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.957
How did that happen,
Richard?

11:30.991 --> 11:34.094
Maybe because you arrested him
in his lawyer's office?

11:34.127 --> 11:36.096
It was an emergency.
He ran in there.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.230
We figured he must have
made his tail.

11:37.263 --> 11:38.231
What about his house?

11:38.264 --> 11:39.733
We're getting a warrant.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.001
We'll be searching it
by the end of business.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.268
We better get her
back alive.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.304
That's all I can say,
Richard.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.173
Bobby Donnell will be here in
five minutes to work out a plea.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.975
If she's dead...

11:49.009 --> 11:51.144
would you stop
with the threats

11:51.177 --> 11:53.847
and offer
some tactical advice?

11:56.449 --> 11:59.485
You want to help me here?
Give me Helen Gamble.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.822
I don't want Helen.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.824
She's the best D. A.
We have

12:03.857 --> 12:05.025
for negotiating
with this firm, Kate.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.459
Setting aside
office politics

12:06.492 --> 12:09.830
or recognizing your politics
are best served

12:09.863 --> 12:11.832
by getting that girl
back alive,

12:11.865 --> 12:13.466
give me Helen Gamble.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.042
I'm unclear.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.444
Your claim is that
the discharge was unlawful?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.179
We're investigating
the circumstances

12:26.212 --> 12:27.781
of the discharge
at the moment.

12:27.814 --> 12:30.050
Our hope is that
we can work something out.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.519
Look, Scott's position
was tenuous

12:32.553 --> 12:34.487
even before the death
of his wife.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.189
He was told that.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.924
Yes, and finally now

12:37.958 --> 12:40.326
I've got the chance to improve
on my job performance,

12:40.360 --> 12:42.328
and I am being denied
that chance.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.463
Scott, I'm your friend.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.565
No, you're not, Harry.

12:44.598 --> 12:45.966
We don't need --

12:45.999 --> 12:47.333
I thought
you were my friend,

12:47.367 --> 12:49.069
but as soon
as I was arrested,

12:49.102 --> 12:50.504
I became a pariah,

12:50.537 --> 12:53.039
and you were the first one
to presume my guilt.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.808
That isn't true.

12:54.841 --> 12:57.578
All right, this is not a forum
to discuss your friendship.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.346
Ms. Frutt, we are
a financial brokerage house.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.348
We are in the business
of soliciting investors

13:02.382 --> 13:04.084
to put huge sums of monies,

13:04.117 --> 13:06.086
not to mention
their confidence in our hands.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.121
That becomes
enormously difficult

13:08.154 --> 13:09.590
when you're saddled
with the perception

13:09.623 --> 13:13.594
that one of the partners
may or may not be a murderer.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.328
I was acquitted.

13:15.361 --> 13:16.963
You were found not guilty,

13:16.997 --> 13:18.932
which is hardly
proof of innocence.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.834
The thing is, Mr. Duvall,

13:20.867 --> 13:23.136
fairness has to come
into play here.

13:23.169 --> 13:26.507
I'm aware of that.
If he is innocent --

13:26.540 --> 13:31.011
I can't even fathom how
unfair this has been to him,

13:31.044 --> 13:33.346
but how fair is it

13:33.379 --> 13:36.449
to everybody else at the firm
to have to suffer?

13:36.482 --> 13:38.451
Couldn't you
wait and see, Harry?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.186
I mean, for God's sake,

13:40.220 --> 13:42.188
why let the facts interfere
with your judgment?

13:42.222 --> 13:44.024
All right, Scott, please.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.532
Look, it would be
extremely difficult

13:51.565 --> 13:54.134
for Scott to find other
employment at the moment.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.037
It would be a lot easier
if he could look

13:57.070 --> 13:59.039
while he was still
working at --

13:59.072 --> 14:01.141
I can't do that.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.376
Three months.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.378
I'm sorry.

14:05.411 --> 14:08.381
The other partners
want him gone...now.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.883
You want me gone.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.552
Scott.

14:11.585 --> 14:14.020
Certainly, 18 years
has to be worth

14:14.054 --> 14:15.388
a little compassion.

14:15.421 --> 14:20.160
I'll offer him compassion,
but not a position.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.231
Lindsay, he's harmless.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.233
Don't tell me
he's harmless, Jeannie.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.302
I mean, you don't --

14:29.335 --> 14:32.305
I don't what?

14:32.338 --> 14:35.308
Okay, look...

14:35.341 --> 14:38.311
I'm telling you this
as part of his legal team.

14:38.344 --> 14:39.680
Privilege applies --

14:39.713 --> 14:42.182
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you're telling me what?

14:42.215 --> 14:44.618
William admitted to me
and Jimmy

14:44.651 --> 14:46.920
that he totally
played you.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.089
He knew he had to insist

14:49.122 --> 14:51.257
on being guilty
for you to be convinced

14:51.291 --> 14:52.693
he was delusional.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.260
He played me, too.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.697
He knew I'd revoke
the insanity plea.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.601
He played both of us.

15:00.634 --> 15:03.336
The guy did it, Jeannie.

15:03.369 --> 15:07.207
Lindsay, he wants you
to think that.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.375
This man will go to his grave

15:09.409 --> 15:10.711
trying to convince people
he's the killer.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.078
No, Jeannie --

15:12.112 --> 15:14.214
I've treated this man
a long time.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.716
I heard what he told me.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.718
Lindsay, the man
did not kill anybody.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.086
-Jeannie, he did.
-HINKS: Can I vote?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.154
-Aah!
-Aah!

15:21.187 --> 15:23.156
Damn it, William.
You scared me.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.158
Mr. Hinks,
I asked you to leave.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.961
Fine. By the way,

15:27.994 --> 15:31.497
is there a decent park
near here to walk a dog?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.737
You don't have a dog,
by any chance, do you?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.639
Get out!

15:38.672 --> 15:40.006
Lindsay.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.042
Hey, if you want
to treat him, fine.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.377
But I am not his lawyer anymore,
and I want him out of here.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.647
What's going --
William?

15:46.680 --> 15:48.248
Jimmy, hi.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.250
Lindsay won't take
my business,

15:50.283 --> 15:53.019
and I could just
kill myself...

15:55.155 --> 15:56.389
or others.

15:56.422 --> 15:59.560
If you don't leave
this office right now,

15:59.593 --> 16:01.327
I will call the police.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.696
I've already called them.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.698
What are you
going to tell them?

16:04.731 --> 16:08.001
A man has just charged in
and tried to hire you?

16:08.034 --> 16:09.536
Hey, sicko,
pick a fingernail.

16:12.038 --> 16:17.277
702 Commercial Avenue,
apartment 13-A.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.680
You really should try
to buy, you know?

16:19.713 --> 16:22.148
You're throwing money away
by renting.

16:22.182 --> 16:26.419
Sir, we represented you.
We got you acquitted.

16:26.452 --> 16:29.155
Our business with you
is over.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.557
You will leave now,

16:30.591 --> 16:33.193
or I will physically
remove you.

16:33.694 --> 16:36.129
Gee.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.298
You look like you've
been working out, too.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.567
Wanna try me, Bill?

16:55.582 --> 16:58.051
He gives her up,
she's unharmed --

16:58.084 --> 16:59.653
kidnapping to extort,

16:59.686 --> 17:01.655
sentence recommendation
of 10 to 15.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.389
He's not going
to accept that.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.525
-If you push it, he might.
-He won't.

17:04.558 --> 17:05.791
Bobby...

17:05.826 --> 17:07.426
Look, this guy didn't
just fall off a truck.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.530
He knows your case
is lousy.

17:09.563 --> 17:11.832
He knows the parents are
putting the screws on you.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.199
You're going to have
to offer

17:13.233 --> 17:17.137
straight kidnapping,
three to five.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.471
(sighs)

17:20.540 --> 17:22.075
Five to seven,

17:22.108 --> 17:24.711
but she's got to be
completely unharmed.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.647
I can take that to him.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.157
We could sue,

17:37.190 --> 17:39.793
but it's our feeling
we wouldn't win.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.795
We probably couldn't
even survive

17:41.828 --> 17:43.363
a motion to dismiss.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.099
We could go back in
to Judge Hiller

17:46.132 --> 17:48.535
and ask for an adjudication
that you're innocent,

17:48.569 --> 17:52.205
"innocent" as opposed
to simply "not guilty."

17:52.238 --> 17:53.707
Do they do that?

17:53.740 --> 17:56.376
In extremely
rare circumstances.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.211
Our thinking
is if we could lift

17:58.244 --> 18:00.346
this cloud of suspicion
off you --

18:00.380 --> 18:02.849
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's what
I want to do, absolutely.

18:02.883 --> 18:04.718
I'm not confident we'll --

18:04.751 --> 18:07.253
Let's just do it, Ellenor.
Now, she was at the trial.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.222
She heard the evidence.
She knows.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.193
Let's do it.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.900
Five to seven years,

18:19.933 --> 18:22.468
you'll be up for parole
after four.

18:22.503 --> 18:24.237
This is a good deal.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.575
Five to seven
I can deal with.

18:28.609 --> 18:31.277
Great.
Now we got to move.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.779
If you tell me
where she is --

18:32.813 --> 18:35.782
Tell them I'll take
the five to seven,

18:35.816 --> 18:38.519
but, uh, that's if
they find her dead or alive.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.522
What?

18:41.555 --> 18:43.489
What nothing.
You heard me.

18:43.524 --> 18:46.860
They're not going to give you
five years if you killed Alessa.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.262
I didn't kill anybody.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.664
Then what the hell
is going on in your head?

18:50.697 --> 18:53.199
Figure it out.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.936
You lock up a 7-year-old girl
alone for 3 days,

18:55.969 --> 18:58.939
who the hell knows
what happens?

18:58.972 --> 19:00.941
If she's dead,
I didn't do it.

19:00.974 --> 19:04.778
So I'm not exactly eager
to confess

19:04.811 --> 19:06.412
and throw myself to Walpole
the rest of my life,

19:06.446 --> 19:09.783
not while there's a chance

19:09.816 --> 19:11.451
I might be able
to skate on this.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.586
Look, I don't know
what you did,

19:12.619 --> 19:14.454
but if I tell this
to the D. A.,

19:14.487 --> 19:15.589
they're going to think
you murdered her.

19:15.622 --> 19:16.957
Hey, that's their problem.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.258
It's your problem!

19:18.291 --> 19:19.392
Bring it to Bay.

19:19.425 --> 19:20.861
Francis --

19:20.894 --> 19:23.363
You go. Bring it to him.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.603
(pounds door)

19:29.636 --> 19:31.772
Guard!

19:31.805 --> 19:36.643
(cellular phone rings)

19:36.677 --> 19:38.211
Hello?

19:38.244 --> 19:40.814
HINKS: Hello. I'm looking
for Lindsay Dole.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.516
This is her husband.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.885
Well, I've definitely got
the wrong number, then.

19:44.918 --> 19:46.452
-(phone clicks)
-And you are?

20:06.707 --> 20:08.709
ELLENOR:
I'd go to the police.

20:08.742 --> 20:10.711
But he didn't really
threaten me.

20:10.744 --> 20:12.813
He said, "I could just
kill myself or others,"

20:12.846 --> 20:14.681
looking right at you.

20:14.715 --> 20:15.949
Even if we could make
an assault charge on that,

20:15.982 --> 20:17.651
I mean, what would
they really do?

20:17.684 --> 20:19.953
To him? They might not
give him bail.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.388
What about telling
the police what he told us?

20:22.422 --> 20:25.626
-Privilege.
-If we think he's about
to commit bodily harm --

20:25.659 --> 20:28.629
But we've got no grounds
on that, Jimmy.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.631
The guy's got my address.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.634
Thanks for antagonizing him,
by the way.

20:33.667 --> 20:34.968
You should talk
to Helen, Lindsay.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.469
Ethically --

20:36.503 --> 20:38.805
To hell with ethics.

20:38.839 --> 20:41.007
Talk to Helen.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.980
-Five to seven if she's dead?
-HELEN: Are you serious?

20:47.013 --> 20:48.381
I know what it sounds like.
Just give him a counter-offer,

20:48.414 --> 20:49.449
say voluntary.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.818
He serves 20 if she's dead.

20:51.852 --> 20:53.687
You have to give him something.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.921
Otherwise,
he'll just go to trial,

20:54.955 --> 20:56.389
and the girl will die.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.327
She's dead already.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.329
Richard, that's not
what this means.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.298
He murdered her.
He killed her days ago.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.067
This whole negotiation --
it's been a ruse.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.603
He knew we were on to him.
He wants to get out

21:09.636 --> 21:12.573
in five for murder,
so he pretends she's alive

21:12.606 --> 21:13.940
so you have something
to bargain with.

21:13.974 --> 21:15.008
We don't know that.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.009
That's what
it looks like.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.644
Were you in on this?

21:17.678 --> 21:19.946
I wasn't in on anything.
He's just playing hardball.

21:19.980 --> 21:22.015
-Get out of my office.
-Wait a second --

21:22.048 --> 21:23.950
-This negotiation is over.
-No, it isn't.

21:23.984 --> 21:25.952
Look, we all know
our positions here,

21:25.986 --> 21:27.521
but if that girl is alive,

21:27.554 --> 21:29.890
just the possibility
that she's alive...

21:29.923 --> 21:31.858
however technically unethical
it may be,

21:31.892 --> 21:34.060
we got to get
on the same side here.

21:34.094 --> 21:36.763
He's not going to give.

21:36.797 --> 21:39.365
Well, then you'll
make him give, Bobby,

21:39.399 --> 21:41.367
and don't tell me
you can't.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.336
Nobody's better at this
than you.

21:45.639 --> 21:47.508
Bobby?

21:47.541 --> 21:49.075
A second.

21:51.612 --> 21:54.047
This is good cop/bad cop.
Don't fall for it.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.682
But she's right, Eugene.

21:55.716 --> 21:58.351
We have to be on
the same side a little here.

21:58.384 --> 21:59.786
No, we do not.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.422
Now, put that girl
out of your mind,

22:02.455 --> 22:04.525
think about your client,
or get off this case.

22:14.134 --> 22:18.672
I need something
to take back to him.

22:18.705 --> 22:21.942
There's no deal
if the girl is dead.

22:21.975 --> 22:23.677
Period.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.012
Then we're done.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.961
Damn it.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.430
It's not unprecedented.

22:44.464 --> 22:49.670
Maybe not, but on what basis
do I declare him innocent?

22:49.703 --> 22:51.505
I would start
with the fact

22:51.538 --> 22:53.707
that he's presumed innocent
until proven guilty

22:53.740 --> 22:55.075
and he was never
proved to be --

22:55.108 --> 22:57.544
If you want a ruling
that I presume him innocent,

22:57.578 --> 22:59.112
I'll give it to you,

22:59.145 --> 23:02.616
but for me to make a finding
of innocence --

23:02.649 --> 23:04.618
Your honor,
he's losing his job.

23:04.651 --> 23:06.620
He's reapplying
for a mortgage.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.755
The bank wants
nothing to do with him.

23:08.789 --> 23:10.557
His neighbors
are trying to bring

23:10.591 --> 23:11.792
a nuisance action
against him.

23:11.825 --> 23:14.861
I'm sure life is being
very unfair to him.

23:14.895 --> 23:18.131
Why don't you sue the police
for arresting him to begin with?

23:18.164 --> 23:21.067
Well, I don't think
that would fly.

23:21.101 --> 23:22.769
Of course it wouldn't,

23:22.803 --> 23:25.071
because there is evidence
against Mr. Wallace.

23:25.105 --> 23:26.707
They were heard fighting.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.710
She had a whack
on the back of the head.

23:29.743 --> 23:32.078
For all I know,
he could have killed her.

23:32.112 --> 23:34.147
He didn't.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.783
Maybe not, but I am
certainly not prepared

23:36.817 --> 23:40.521
to make a finding of innocence.

23:40.554 --> 23:43.724
Did you really think
I would?

23:47.127 --> 23:48.729
HELEN: Did he say
anything else?

23:48.762 --> 23:49.830
My address.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.164
The tenor
was a threat, Helen.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.999
I know it would be
tough to make,

23:53.033 --> 23:54.835
but he's scaring
the hell out of me.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.069
What do you
want me to do?

23:56.102 --> 23:59.105
Arrest him.
Scare the hell out of him.

23:59.139 --> 24:00.841
Lindsay, your husband
already has me

24:00.874 --> 24:02.576
scrambling over
this kidnapping.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.910
The guy's a psycho.

24:03.944 --> 24:05.912
You realize --

24:05.946 --> 24:08.682
Just scare him, Helen,
please?

24:15.021 --> 24:16.189
BOBBY: Where is she now?

24:16.222 --> 24:19.125
She and Lucy went
to speak with Helen.

24:19.159 --> 24:20.661
Exactly what did he say?

24:20.694 --> 24:22.663
Well, it was very veiled.

24:22.696 --> 24:25.031
I'm not sure Helen will
actually be able

24:25.065 --> 24:27.834
to do anything, but I would
change your locks.

24:27.868 --> 24:29.703
(door opens)

24:33.774 --> 24:36.042
Do you know
where she is?

24:36.076 --> 24:38.879
Mr. Engel, you know
I can't talk to you.

24:38.912 --> 24:41.014
Do you know
where my daughter is?

24:42.816 --> 24:45.085
No.

24:48.822 --> 24:50.524
Is she dead?

24:50.557 --> 24:52.726
I don't know.

24:52.759 --> 24:53.960
Okay, this -- sir --

24:53.994 --> 24:56.062
How can you
two just sit back --

24:56.096 --> 24:58.498
You've got to be
a little human.

24:59.933 --> 25:04.104
She's 7 years old.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.742
Mr. Engel --

25:08.775 --> 25:10.611
Bobby.

25:10.644 --> 25:11.812
Eugene.

25:11.845 --> 25:14.080
Are you willing
to help me get her back?

25:14.114 --> 25:16.082
What kind of question
is that?

25:16.116 --> 25:18.719
With more public pressure
on the D. A.'s office

25:18.752 --> 25:21.087
to make a deal,
they might make a deal,

25:21.121 --> 25:24.190
and you could help
generate that pressure.

25:29.129 --> 25:31.197
What the hell is this?

25:31.231 --> 25:34.668
A press release from me
and the Engel parents.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.737
Noon tomorrow, we'll hold
a joint press conference

25:36.770 --> 25:38.939
saying that my client has
information on the kidnapping.

25:38.972 --> 25:41.908
We'll blame your office
and you personally

25:41.942 --> 25:45.045
for scuttling the only chance
to save Alessa by not making

25:45.078 --> 25:46.680
a deal with him.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.248
Your client
supports you on this?

25:48.281 --> 25:50.651
He told me to do whatever
it takes to make a deal.

25:50.684 --> 25:53.854
Your gun is pointed
at your own head, Mr. Donnell.

25:53.887 --> 25:56.690
If you do this,
you'll be admitting

25:56.723 --> 25:58.324
to every potential juror
in Massachusetts

25:58.358 --> 26:00.861
that your client
is the kidnapper.

26:00.894 --> 26:04.164
I've never heard
of anything so stupid,

26:04.197 --> 26:05.599
not to mention unethical.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.200
They'll take away
your bar card.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.902
I'll make sure of it.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.738
Do what you have to do.

26:15.008 --> 26:17.343
She's already dead.

26:17.377 --> 26:21.014
This is just a bunch
of black marks on white paper.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.718
You could be right.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.887
You could be wrong.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.690
Glad I don't have
to make that guess.

26:29.723 --> 26:31.725
We'll give you two hours.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.267
We searched his house?

26:41.301 --> 26:42.335
Came up empty.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.837
What about his van?

26:43.870 --> 26:45.739
The interior was
washed and vacuumed --

26:45.772 --> 26:47.808
shows he was trying
to destroy evidence.

26:47.841 --> 26:49.109
Trying? He succeeded.

26:49.142 --> 26:50.844
We don't know that yet.

26:50.877 --> 26:53.980
Fiber? Hair? DNA? Anything
to tie him to the girl?

26:54.014 --> 26:56.182
-As of now, no.
-We have nothing?

26:56.216 --> 26:58.284
Kate, we're one day
into the case.

26:58.318 --> 27:01.888
We might lose the bail hearing,
in which case he goes free.

27:03.957 --> 27:05.291
Sign this plea agreement

27:05.325 --> 27:08.028
and fax it to Bobby Donnell
immediately.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.130
We're negotiating
with these terrorists?

27:10.163 --> 27:12.866
Sign it, Richard.

27:16.069 --> 27:18.138
I will not.

27:21.441 --> 27:24.410
(signing paper)

27:26.980 --> 27:32.118
Fax this to Bobby Donnell
and get that girl back.

27:32.152 --> 27:33.687
It's not right!

27:33.720 --> 27:34.955
(chair flips over)

27:34.988 --> 27:35.989
(sighs)

27:38.258 --> 27:41.161
We're going to take
one shot with Duvall.

27:41.194 --> 27:43.964
He agreed to a meeting
without his lawyer.

27:43.997 --> 27:46.900
He's not going to change
his mind. Why would he?

27:46.933 --> 27:49.402
Well, when he said
you two were friends,

27:49.435 --> 27:51.404
are you two friends?

27:51.437 --> 27:53.974
Yeah, we had lunch
together every day.

27:54.007 --> 27:55.976
Our wives were even close.

27:56.009 --> 28:00.246
And then after
they all pulled away --

28:00.280 --> 28:03.083
everybody --

28:03.116 --> 28:06.252
and they still
think I'm --

28:06.286 --> 28:09.990
Doesn't it mean anything?
For God's sake.

28:10.023 --> 28:11.825
A jury hears
all the evidence,

28:11.858 --> 28:14.460
and they found me
not guilty.

28:14.494 --> 28:16.930
I mean, doesn't that
mean anything?

28:16.963 --> 28:18.899
Unfortunately, no.

28:18.932 --> 28:20.901
The police make a mistake,

28:20.934 --> 28:23.737
and I am discriminated
against now

28:23.770 --> 28:25.739
because of that mistake,
and you're telling me

28:25.772 --> 28:29.743
that there is
no existing legal remedy,

28:29.776 --> 28:33.246
that I just have
to eat the bigotry,

28:33.279 --> 28:36.316
I have to accept it
and say that's life?

28:36.349 --> 28:39.786
Well, I will not let that
be my life!

28:48.895 --> 28:52.298
Let us take one last shot
with Mr. Duvall.

28:52.332 --> 28:55.235
He's going to be here
tonight at 8:00.

28:59.439 --> 29:02.142
GAMBLE: He's in there?

29:02.175 --> 29:04.511
He went in
20 minutes ago.

29:04.545 --> 29:07.147
You sure you want
to do this, Helen?

29:07.180 --> 29:10.050
Favor bank.
Don't even knock.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.352
Go ahead.

29:17.357 --> 29:18.892
Freeze! On the ground!

29:18.925 --> 29:21.461
Get on the ground!

29:26.199 --> 29:29.169
Mr. Hinks, you are under arrest
for criminal assault.

29:29.202 --> 29:31.337
You have the right
to remain silent.

29:31.371 --> 29:32.506
I didn't do anything.

29:32.539 --> 29:34.174
Yeah, you did, Mr. Hinks.

29:34.207 --> 29:38.344
A threat constitutes
an assault.

29:38.378 --> 29:41.447
For example,
if I were to say to you

29:41.481 --> 29:44.518
"If you ever go
near Lindsay Dole again,

29:44.551 --> 29:46.520
"I will find a way

29:46.553 --> 29:48.454
"to have you
accidentally shot

29:48.488 --> 29:50.557
and killed
by a police officer" --

29:50.591 --> 29:52.292
something like that --

29:52.325 --> 29:56.830
that would be an assault,
so I would never say that.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.865
Get him out of here.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.854
I want you there, Bobby.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.355
If I can make it, I will.

30:22.388 --> 30:23.590
These other lawyers,

30:23.624 --> 30:25.458
I don't think they're
too good, you know.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.461
Scott, Ellenor Frutt and
Jimmy Berluti are excellent.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.063
I want you, dammit!

30:37.470 --> 30:41.141
You don't seem to be
doing too well.

30:41.174 --> 30:43.309
Are you still taking
the medication?

30:43.343 --> 30:45.378
Look, you want to give me
my life back in a pill,

30:45.411 --> 30:46.580
I'll swallow it.

30:46.613 --> 30:48.214
Scott, are you taking
your medication?

30:48.248 --> 30:51.151
Yes, but this is rough.

30:51.184 --> 30:53.419
I didn't expect them
to welcome me back.

30:53.453 --> 30:55.455
I'm not naive, but --

30:55.488 --> 30:57.591
Remember how you spoke
of going to Fiji?

30:57.624 --> 31:00.527
Well, maybe you should go
for a couple of weeks.

31:00.561 --> 31:02.128
Get some rest.

31:05.131 --> 31:06.466
We got to fly.

31:06.499 --> 31:08.535
Okay.

31:08.569 --> 31:11.437
I will do my absolute best
to make the meeting,

31:11.471 --> 31:14.474
but you're in great hands
with Ellenor and Jimmy.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.616
The judge is waiting.
We go right in,

31:22.649 --> 31:24.284
get the plea entered,

31:24.317 --> 31:27.654
and then you reveal
the location of the girl.

31:27.688 --> 31:31.091
They tossed my house
yesterday, you hear?

31:31.124 --> 31:33.293
Yeah.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.661
They didn't find anything.

31:34.695 --> 31:35.662
(door opens)

31:35.696 --> 31:37.063
Nothing.

31:37.097 --> 31:38.398
You sign the plea?

31:38.431 --> 31:40.634
Listen, I'm, uh,
suddenly thinking

31:40.667 --> 31:43.203
that, uh,
I'm going to trial.

31:43.236 --> 31:46.106
I'm not pleading.

31:46.139 --> 31:47.373
What?

31:47.407 --> 31:50.243
You said it yourself.
They got no case.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.945
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Francis,

31:51.978 --> 31:54.114
there's no statute
of limitations on murder.

31:54.147 --> 31:56.950
They have your whole life
to make the case.

31:56.983 --> 31:59.385
They ain't gonna make.
I got a feeling.

31:59.419 --> 32:01.154
You've trusted me
on three trials.

32:01.187 --> 32:04.124
Trust me here. This is
the best deal we'll ever get.

32:04.157 --> 32:05.992
We?

32:06.026 --> 32:08.428
You gonna do the time
with me, counselor?

32:13.199 --> 32:17.704
Listen, forget all that.

32:17.738 --> 32:22.175
This is
a little girl's life.

32:25.345 --> 32:29.082
Francis,
you're not a murderer.

32:29.115 --> 32:32.418
I know you.

32:32.452 --> 32:36.189
That little girl --

32:36.222 --> 32:39.459
You ever see her house
off of Brattle?

32:39.492 --> 32:41.728
It's like a castle.

32:41.762 --> 32:45.498
She's this
little princess.

32:47.601 --> 32:51.304
She's had
seven good years.

32:51.337 --> 32:54.474
That's better
than I ever had.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.749
No deal.

33:02.783 --> 33:06.720
You're letting her die.

33:08.463 --> 33:13.359
I said...no deal.

33:16.429 --> 33:19.332
Tell the D. A.

33:19.365 --> 33:23.169
Go.

33:23.203 --> 33:24.538
Now what?

33:24.571 --> 33:26.640
I don't know. I guess
we just go tell them.

33:26.673 --> 33:28.509
Go tell them
it's going south,

33:28.542 --> 33:30.511
see if they can
improve the offer.

33:30.544 --> 33:32.613
-There's no way
they're going to --
-Take the shot.

33:32.646 --> 33:35.348
What are you
going to do?

33:35.381 --> 33:38.218
I'm going to take
another shot with Francis.

33:38.251 --> 33:40.587
Good. Then we can
compare cement walls.

33:40.621 --> 33:42.122
Hurry.

33:44.390 --> 33:49.362
Rebecca, call me back
in 30 seconds on my cell.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.131
Just do it.

33:55.536 --> 33:56.637
What now?

33:56.670 --> 33:58.304
Eugene is telling them,

33:58.338 --> 34:01.374
but, Francis, I just want
to make sure you understand.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.376
They could hit you
with life

34:03.409 --> 34:05.078
on the kidnapping alone.

34:05.111 --> 34:06.513
I understand that.

34:06.547 --> 34:09.282
At some point, this girl
is going to be found.

34:09.315 --> 34:10.551
Don't be so sure.

34:10.583 --> 34:12.118
(cellular phone rings)

34:12.152 --> 34:14.387
Hello?

34:14.420 --> 34:15.656
What?

34:15.688 --> 34:18.625
Where did they say?

34:18.659 --> 34:21.661
(sighs)

34:21.695 --> 34:24.531
All right, I'll tell him.

34:24.565 --> 34:27.266
(hangs up phone)

34:27.300 --> 34:29.135
That was Bay.

34:29.168 --> 34:32.138
You said
you vacuumed your van.

34:32.172 --> 34:33.674
Yeah, what's, uh --

34:33.706 --> 34:35.676
Passenger compartment
or just the back?

34:35.708 --> 34:37.578
She wasn't
in the passenger compartment.

34:37.610 --> 34:39.312
They say they found
a long blond hair

34:39.344 --> 34:41.313
off the driver's seat.

34:41.347 --> 34:42.683
They're lying.

34:42.716 --> 34:44.685
They're giving us
10 minutes from right now

34:44.717 --> 34:46.152
to take the deal.

34:46.186 --> 34:48.221
I vacuumed it myself --

34:48.254 --> 34:51.491
Francis,
this changes things.

34:51.525 --> 34:54.226
You got to run
the odds again.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.196
I say we close the deal

34:56.228 --> 34:58.264
while it's still
on the table.

35:01.868 --> 35:03.837
He asked whether
she had a dog.

35:03.870 --> 35:06.406
That's how he met all
his victims -- walking dogs.

35:06.439 --> 35:09.309
He said he would
kill himself or others.

35:09.342 --> 35:11.678
He stared at Lucy Hatcher
and uttered her address.

35:11.712 --> 35:14.447
None of this rises
to the level of assault.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.882
Your honor, given the history
of this man --

35:15.916 --> 35:17.551
His history isn't relevant.

35:17.584 --> 35:19.853
We can only look
at these specific acts,

35:19.886 --> 35:20.921
and uttering an address
doesn't in any way --

35:20.954 --> 35:22.623
If the court
would like to hear

35:22.656 --> 35:23.824
from Lindsay Dole
or Ms. Hatcher --

35:23.857 --> 35:25.859
This is not
an evidentiary hearing,

35:25.892 --> 35:27.327
but I suppose
the court could also

35:27.360 --> 35:29.162
direct questions
to Jeannie Reynolds,

35:29.195 --> 35:30.931
Mr. Hinks'
treating psychologist.

35:30.964 --> 35:32.666
She is
of the continued opinion

35:32.699 --> 35:34.467
that this is
a harmless man

35:34.500 --> 35:36.436
who just wants people
to think he's a killer.

35:36.469 --> 35:38.171
Lindsay Dole is in fear
for her life,

35:38.204 --> 35:40.874
the Commonwealth believes
with good reason.

35:40.907 --> 35:43.243
All right, look,
I don't see how

35:43.276 --> 35:45.612
I can bind him over
on the facts alleged here.

35:45.646 --> 35:47.480
Here's what
I'm going to do.

35:47.514 --> 35:49.482
The criminal complaint
is dismissed.

35:49.516 --> 35:51.918
I am issuing
a restraining order

35:51.952 --> 35:55.789
requiring Mr. Hinks
not to contact,

35:55.822 --> 35:59.259
follow, or approach
Ms. Dole and Ms. Hatcher

35:59.292 --> 36:03.496
and to stay at all times
at least 1,000 feet

36:03.530 --> 36:05.966
from them, their homes,
and their offices.

36:05.999 --> 36:09.636
You understand that, Mr. Hinks?
No going near these women.

36:09.670 --> 36:13.239
But I'm free to visit
Ms. Gamble?

36:14.775 --> 36:19.245
I am now adding Ms. Gamble
to the list.

36:19.279 --> 36:22.448
You are to stay away
from her, as well, and me.

36:22.482 --> 36:24.317
We are adjourned.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.953
(bangs gavel)

36:32.526 --> 36:35.261
I guess this is
officially goodbye, then.

37:06.760 --> 37:09.563
Stay back with me,
stay back with me.

37:09.596 --> 37:12.398
Please, God,
let her be alive.

37:20.440 --> 37:21.842
Down, down, down!

37:21.875 --> 37:23.944
Down, down, down!
Get down! Get down!

37:23.977 --> 37:27.648
It's all right.

37:30.517 --> 37:31.985
I lied to him.

37:33.620 --> 37:34.955
Sorry?

37:34.988 --> 37:38.525
I told him they found
a hair of hers in his car.

37:42.362 --> 37:45.599
That's how I got him
to take the deal.

37:45.632 --> 37:47.701
I don't care, Eugene.

37:47.734 --> 37:50.370
I wasn't going to let
a little girl...

37:51.905 --> 37:55.308
It's time for you
to get out of criminal law.

37:57.911 --> 37:59.412
OFFICER: Coming out!

37:59.445 --> 38:00.446
(Alessa crying)

38:00.480 --> 38:03.717
Coming out, coming out!

38:03.750 --> 38:06.853
Thank you, God.

38:15.395 --> 38:17.998
Oh, sweetheart!

38:18.031 --> 38:21.334
(sobbing)

38:29.576 --> 38:33.379
Look, Scott, this isn't
just my decision.

38:33.413 --> 38:35.649
Oh, don't tell me that, Harry.
They follow you.

38:35.682 --> 38:37.984
They took their cue
when you pulled away.

38:38.018 --> 38:41.087
No, no, I'm not
getting into that again.

38:41.121 --> 38:44.090
Oh, what? That's an
inconvenience to have
that discussion?

38:44.124 --> 38:47.027
Okay, Scott,
cut it out.

38:47.060 --> 38:49.996
All right, look.
What we're asking,

38:50.030 --> 38:51.832
forget about making him
a partner, just let him
trade--

38:51.865 --> 38:55.101
-It's not that simple.
-Why can't it be?

38:55.135 --> 38:59.439
Ms. Frutt,
the employees

38:59.472 --> 39:01.742
don't want him around.

39:03.677 --> 39:05.712
Not as a partner,

39:05.746 --> 39:07.714
not as a coworker.

39:07.748 --> 39:10.684
They don't even want him
in the building.

39:12.619 --> 39:14.721
What about you, Harry?

39:14.755 --> 39:15.989
Scott...

39:16.022 --> 39:17.591
It's a question.

39:17.624 --> 39:19.593
Doesn't our friendship
even deserve

39:19.626 --> 39:21.461
an honest response?

39:21.494 --> 39:25.899
Okay.

39:25.932 --> 39:28.735
I don't want you around
either, Scott.

39:30.070 --> 39:32.172
You're not
the same person

39:32.205 --> 39:34.474
that I used to be
friends with,

39:34.508 --> 39:37.844
and whether you killed
Karen or not,

39:37.878 --> 39:41.147
you're just not the same man
I used to know.

39:41.181 --> 39:44.184
I'm going to tell you
something now.

39:44.217 --> 39:46.486
When all of this
happened,

39:46.520 --> 39:50.490
I needed my friends
more than ever.

39:50.524 --> 39:52.826
I needed you, Harry,

39:52.859 --> 39:55.629
and to see you pull away,
to see you recoil

39:55.662 --> 39:59.733
at the idea that you and I
were once friends,

39:59.766 --> 40:02.168
that it was, like,
repugnant to you --

40:02.202 --> 40:04.505
you think you're
the same person?

40:04.538 --> 40:06.907
You need to move on
with your life, Scott.

40:06.940 --> 40:10.076
My life has been
taken from me.

40:13.179 --> 40:14.214
-Oh, Jesus, Scott!
-Scott!

40:14.247 --> 40:17.450
This is just the anesthesia.

40:17.483 --> 40:18.952
It numbs the pain.

40:18.985 --> 40:20.453
ELLENOR: Scott, please.

40:20.486 --> 40:21.655
Just quiet.

40:21.688 --> 40:23.189
Put the gun --

40:23.223 --> 40:25.592
Just shut up now! Your powers
of persuasion stink.

40:25.626 --> 40:27.060
Scott, listen to me.

40:27.093 --> 40:29.062
This is not the answer.

40:29.095 --> 40:31.698
How the hell do you know?
You ever tried it?

40:31.732 --> 40:34.234
Last time you shot yourself,
it didn't work out?

40:34.267 --> 40:37.203
Okay, you can have
your job back.

40:37.237 --> 40:39.239
I can have my job --

40:39.272 --> 40:41.241
Scott, Scott,
listen to me.

40:41.274 --> 40:42.943
If you kill yourself,

40:42.976 --> 40:45.946
people are going to think
that you killed Karen.

40:45.979 --> 40:48.248
You ever think
about that?

40:48.281 --> 40:50.250
People are going to say,

40:50.283 --> 40:52.252
"See? He was nuts
after all.

40:52.285 --> 40:55.088
He killed her,
he killed himself."

40:55.121 --> 40:58.458
Is that the legacy that you
really want to leave, Scott?

41:05.599 --> 41:08.735
No.

41:10.637 --> 41:12.105
Harry, you're right.

41:12.138 --> 41:15.208
You're absolutely right.

41:21.281 --> 41:25.151
(gun clicks)

41:31.792 --> 41:35.028
I bet you're glad
I'm out of bullets.

41:35.061 --> 41:38.231
Huh?

41:41.902 --> 41:44.270
I'm going to need
you and Ellenor

41:44.304 --> 41:46.306
to come down,
make statements.

41:46.339 --> 41:48.041
Okay.

41:48.074 --> 41:49.776
How you doing?

41:49.810 --> 41:52.913
Okay, I guess.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.155
Don't say anything
to anybody.

42:02.188 --> 42:03.757
Let's go.

42:03.790 --> 42:06.292
He's represented, Frank.

42:06.326 --> 42:07.661
Got it.

42:34.688 --> 42:35.922
You okay?

42:35.956 --> 42:38.358
I don't know. How could...

42:38.391 --> 42:40.360
He was on the edge,
Bobby.

42:40.393 --> 42:42.929
Should I -- should we
have seen this coming?

42:42.963 --> 42:44.965
No. I mean,
how could anybody --

42:46.399 --> 42:48.234
What's that?

42:51.137 --> 42:52.873
I don't know.

43:01.715 --> 43:05.318
"To Lindsay with affection."

43:13.426 --> 43:15.261
it's a little dog.

43:20.333 --> 43:21.902
Who's sending you a dog?

43:35.381 --> 43:37.317
â™ª (theme)

43:59.906 --> 44:01.374
You stinker!
