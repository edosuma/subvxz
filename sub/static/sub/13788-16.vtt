WEBVTT

00:06.257 --> 00:07.888
Guess who's the parent
volunteer heading up

00:07.888 --> 00:09.220
this year's school carnival?

00:09.220 --> 00:10.551
Don't care.

00:10.551 --> 00:12.763
That's right,
it's your mom.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.136
Got the binder,
so you know it's official.

00:15.136 --> 00:17.268
Officially don't care.

00:17.268 --> 00:19.100
Then you'll be even more
excited to hear

00:19.100 --> 00:20.271
that I'm gonna be changing
things up this year.

00:20.271 --> 00:21.982
Not listening.

00:21.982 --> 00:23.564
By which I mean
you're not listening to me.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.858
Last year's carnival
was horribly dangerous.

00:27.858 --> 00:29.530
Oh, man,
eight injuries, Tyler.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.152
Eight. Not this year.

00:31.152 --> 00:32.153
I'm gonna make
this year's carnival

00:32.153 --> 00:33.614
the safest carnival ever.

00:33.614 --> 00:37.158
In fact, I'm gonna call it
the "care-nival."

00:37.158 --> 00:38.249
Safe one, Ellen.

00:41.622 --> 00:43.544
Tyler gave me
$5 to sit here.

00:45.256 --> 00:46.507
Guess who's the
parent volunteer

00:46.507 --> 00:48.339
heading up this year's
school carnival?

00:48.339 --> 00:49.340
Don't care.

00:52.173 --> 00:54.345
STAN: All this talk about
safety has me feeling

00:54.345 --> 00:55.436
a little cautious.

00:55.436 --> 00:56.887
And not just for me.

00:56.887 --> 00:58.349
For Robert too.

00:59.890 --> 01:01.061
Yes, it is necessary.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.314
Yes, it is.

01:03.314 --> 01:06.277
Yes, it is.

01:06.277 --> 01:07.358
See?

01:31.922 --> 01:34.135
I think for the talent stage
at this year's carnival,

01:34.135 --> 01:35.766
we should definitely
all wear hats.

01:35.766 --> 01:37.138
You and your hats,
Lindsay.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.179
What are you
hiding under there?

01:38.179 --> 01:39.310
Nothing.

01:39.310 --> 01:41.061
Certainly not
a roll of toilm et paper

01:41.061 --> 01:42.643
that's much softer than
what the school provides.

01:43.934 --> 01:45.646
Uh, so, Avery,
what do you think

01:45.646 --> 01:46.817
we should do
for the talent stage?

01:46.817 --> 01:48.149
Huh?

01:48.149 --> 01:49.280
Our song
for the talent stage.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.281
I'm thinking country.

01:50.281 --> 01:52.193
Which country?

01:52.193 --> 01:53.614
'Cause Turkmenistan has
some very gloomy folk music

01:53.614 --> 01:55.496
I'm fond of.

01:55.496 --> 01:57.618
Oh, I'm not singing
with you guys this year.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.241
I don't want anything to
cut into my time with Wes.

02:00.241 --> 02:01.952
I assumed you guys knew
I was going with him.

02:03.334 --> 02:04.505
I should've
seen this coming.

02:04.505 --> 02:06.297
This is just like
when my older sister

02:06.297 --> 02:09.210
turned her back on the family
and moved in with her husband.

02:09.210 --> 02:11.252
Whatever makes
you happy, Becca.

02:13.214 --> 02:14.925
Avery, you've been
totally blowing us off for Wes

02:14.925 --> 02:16.427
since you started dating.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.849
You guys, nothing
between us has changed.

02:18.849 --> 02:21.222
We're still friends.
We still hang out.

02:21.222 --> 02:22.433
Like right now.

02:22.433 --> 02:23.854
There's Wes.

02:25.266 --> 02:27.398
Hey, boyfriend.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.071
You excited
for the carnival Friday?

02:31.071 --> 02:33.033
I'm not sure if I'm going
to the carnival.

02:33.033 --> 02:34.405
I haven't decided yet.

02:34.405 --> 02:38.038
Oh, I just assumed
we were going, together.

02:38.038 --> 02:39.240
Maybe.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.451
Uh, I don't know.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.583
Look, I have to
go to class.

02:42.583 --> 02:45.206
Well, I have to go
to the bathroom!

02:45.206 --> 02:47.498
That did not make me
feel less awkward!

02:53.714 --> 02:56.427
Hmm, good move, Chlo-ster.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.719
Yes, it was, Daddy-pants.

03:00.851 --> 03:02.303
Mommy's wearing
a lab coat, goggles,

03:02.303 --> 03:03.724
and holding a mallet.

03:03.724 --> 03:05.476
Am I having
a normal childhood?

03:05.476 --> 03:07.358
No, honey.
No, you are not.

03:08.399 --> 03:10.231
Don't worry, sweetie.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.483
I'm just testing all these
carnival games to see

03:12.483 --> 03:15.075
which ones lead to serious
injury and pain.

03:15.075 --> 03:16.407
Will it ever be normal?

03:16.407 --> 03:17.778
Let's cling to the hope.

03:17.778 --> 03:19.280
It's what keeps us going.

03:21.912 --> 03:23.494
Ah! My clavicle!

03:23.494 --> 03:26.327
Don't yell out
funny-sounding body parts

03:26.327 --> 03:27.958
if you want sympathy.

03:31.131 --> 03:32.293
I win.

03:32.293 --> 03:35.135
Congratulations again, Chloe.

03:36.427 --> 03:38.799
Oof! My air sac!

03:38.799 --> 03:42.102
Now, what did I say about
funny-sounding body parts?

03:42.102 --> 03:44.104
This softball hurt.

03:44.104 --> 03:45.436
Now I'm gonna need
a medicine ball

03:45.436 --> 03:46.347
to make it better.

03:46.347 --> 03:47.518
Ow!

03:47.518 --> 03:49.980
Curse my hilarious wordplay.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.313
I am banning all these
dangerous games

03:52.313 --> 03:53.354
from the carnival,
Bennett.

03:53.354 --> 03:55.115
Come on,
let's go ice you up.

03:55.115 --> 03:57.278
Ah, ah!
Clavicle, clavicle!

03:57.278 --> 03:58.909
Honey, your whole body
is not a clavicle.

03:58.909 --> 04:00.361
Well, it feels like it is!

04:01.662 --> 04:03.824
Stan, I don't mean
to brag,

04:03.824 --> 04:05.866
but I'm pretty darn good
at checkers.

04:05.866 --> 04:07.368
Chloe,
I don't want to destroy

04:07.368 --> 04:09.370
your already
abnormal childhood,

04:09.370 --> 04:11.372
but sometimes,
parents let little kids win

04:11.372 --> 04:12.963
to build up their confidence.

04:12.963 --> 04:15.215
What?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.839
So, does that mean
all my wins are a lie?

04:18.839 --> 04:20.591
Every time I beat him
in a foot race,

04:20.591 --> 04:23.474
pinned him in wrestling,
blocked his jump shot?

04:23.474 --> 04:26.056
Chloe, I'm sure
your dad just lets you win

04:26.056 --> 04:27.227
because he loves you.

04:27.227 --> 04:30.441
Love is for losers.
I want victory!

04:30.441 --> 04:32.232
I demand
a checkers rematch.

04:32.232 --> 04:33.484
I'm not
a little kid anymore.

04:33.484 --> 04:35.065
I'm a young lady.

04:35.065 --> 04:37.027
A young lady who wants
to win for realsies!

04:38.238 --> 04:40.861
And who spits a little
when she's angry.

04:44.244 --> 04:47.748
And check, and check.

04:47.748 --> 04:51.251
Hmm, come back to that one.

04:51.251 --> 04:53.213
Stan, something really
weird is going on.

04:53.213 --> 04:55.005
What?

04:55.005 --> 04:56.377
Wes isn't talking to me,
and I don't know why.

04:56.377 --> 04:57.878
Oh, I thought you were
gonna say it was weird

04:57.878 --> 04:59.340
I'm sitting on your bed,

04:59.340 --> 05:02.553
taking a personality test
from a ladies magazine.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.345
Turns out
I'm an intuitive extrovert

05:04.345 --> 05:07.518
who would make
an excellent crisis counselor.

05:07.518 --> 05:09.850
Come on, Stan,
I'm freaking out!

05:09.850 --> 05:11.852
Everybody, calm down, okay?

05:11.852 --> 05:13.524
Take a deep breath.

05:13.524 --> 05:16.146
You see?
These things don't lie.

05:17.147 --> 05:18.899
What is going on with Wes?

05:18.899 --> 05:21.201
I mean, has he stopped
liking me for some reason?

05:21.201 --> 05:23.203
Do I smell?
Do I talk too much?

05:23.203 --> 05:24.445
What is he thinking?

05:24.445 --> 05:27.498
Come on,
crisis counselor, counsel!

05:27.498 --> 05:30.290
Look, Avery,
if you learned anything

05:30.290 --> 05:32.292
from all your
miscommunications with Wes,

05:32.292 --> 05:33.664
it should be don't drive

05:33.664 --> 05:36.126
yourself crazy
trying to figure it out.

05:36.126 --> 05:37.458
Talk to him.

05:37.458 --> 05:38.669
You're right.

05:38.669 --> 05:40.671
I should talk to him.
Thanks, Stan.

05:40.671 --> 05:43.303
No big, I'm a crisis counselor.

05:43.303 --> 05:45.516
Uh, check that,
I added up wrong.

05:45.516 --> 05:48.929
I should be a high
powered businesswoman.

05:48.929 --> 05:50.971
Look out, glass ceiling.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.104
Whoa!

05:55.235 --> 05:57.237
No bounce house
at the care-nival!

06:04.194 --> 06:05.536
Hey, boyfriend.

06:06.537 --> 06:08.038
Avery, what--

06:08.038 --> 06:09.620
So, you haven't been
returning my texts.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.331
I thought
this might be a fun,

06:11.331 --> 06:13.994
and not the least bit
crazy way to bump into you.

06:13.994 --> 06:15.586
So, can we talk?

06:15.586 --> 06:17.838
By the way, I corrected
some of your bio homework

06:17.838 --> 06:19.339
while I was in there.

06:19.339 --> 06:21.712
A lot of people get reptiles
and amphibians confused.

06:21.712 --> 06:24.344
Easy mistake, you're welcome.

06:24.344 --> 06:26.767
Look, Avery,
I just can't talk right now.

06:29.349 --> 06:31.011
Tyler.
Dab.

06:31.011 --> 06:32.312
Cute shirt.
Cute shoes.

06:32.312 --> 06:33.854
TOGETHER: Thanks.

06:33.854 --> 06:35.355
Okay, let's get
down to business.

06:35.355 --> 06:36.567
You've got to do
something about your mom.

06:36.567 --> 06:39.399
Hey, my dad loves her.
What am I gonna do?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.021
No, about the care-nival!

06:41.021 --> 06:42.282
ALL: Yeah!

06:42.282 --> 06:44.575
Look, no one wants
this carnival to be unsafe.

06:44.575 --> 06:46.366
I faint when I see
people get hurt.

06:46.366 --> 06:49.119
Because I'm very empathetic
and I think it's gross.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.582
But we've all been talking,

06:51.582 --> 06:53.624
and she can't take all the games
and rides away.

06:53.624 --> 06:55.335
ALL: Yeah!

06:55.335 --> 06:57.498
Because I also faint
when I'm not having fun.

06:57.498 --> 06:58.919
Wait a minute, are,

06:58.919 --> 07:00.751
are you asking me
to talk to my mother?

07:00.751 --> 07:02.212
Is that really
what you're asking?

07:02.212 --> 07:04.254
She's gonna ask me
how my day was,

07:04.254 --> 07:05.506
what I learned at school.

07:05.506 --> 07:07.307
( gasps )

07:07.307 --> 07:08.509
What's new?

07:10.681 --> 07:12.723
Look, I'm not saying
I won't do it.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.224
I'll do it.

07:14.224 --> 07:15.686
I just want you to know
what you're asking.

07:17.317 --> 07:19.269
That man is a hero!

07:21.732 --> 07:23.233
Avery?

07:23.233 --> 07:26.276
You guys, I feel so awful
about this whole Wes thing.

07:26.276 --> 07:28.448
We knew you'd come
around and apologize.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.830
I didn't.
I wrote you off.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.281
You were dead in my heart.

07:32.282 --> 07:33.784
Apologize?

07:33.784 --> 07:36.497
No, I'm upset because Wes
is acting super weird.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.418
So, this is all about Wes?

07:38.418 --> 07:41.001
Dead in my heart again.

07:41.001 --> 07:42.422
And I thought you were
ready to work on our song

07:42.422 --> 07:43.584
for the carnival.

07:43.584 --> 07:44.585
Why don't you just
do your thing,

07:44.585 --> 07:46.346
we'll do ours, and,

07:46.346 --> 07:47.427
and you don't have to waste
your time with us anymore.

07:48.428 --> 07:50.140
Fine, leave!

07:50.140 --> 07:51.932
I have to go to the
bathroom anyway!

07:51.932 --> 07:53.684
Why do I keep doing that?

08:00.230 --> 08:01.942
I want you to really play.

08:01.942 --> 08:04.234
It's not fun to win
unless I'm really winning.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.366
I don't want to be treated
like some punk baby.

08:07.908 --> 08:09.199
Okay, did you know
that every--

08:09.199 --> 08:12.072
Yes, I've been told.

08:12.072 --> 08:14.535
Okay, if you want me to
try to win, maybe it's time

08:14.535 --> 08:16.376
for you to learn
how to lose.

08:16.376 --> 08:17.708
You're a big girl.

08:17.708 --> 08:21.081
The key is to lose
with grace and dignity.

08:23.213 --> 08:24.585
No!

08:26.176 --> 08:28.799
And that is how
not to lose gracefully.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.130
I hope you were
paying attention,

08:30.130 --> 08:31.341
because next time,
I'm gonna win.

08:31.341 --> 08:32.302
Set it up.

08:36.937 --> 08:39.099
Wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

08:40.400 --> 08:41.311
We're going again.

08:49.199 --> 08:50.741
Chloe gave me
$5 to sit here.

08:52.863 --> 08:55.285
Okay, here goes.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.369
I win.

08:59.369 --> 09:00.460
I got this.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.375
It's funnier
when you do it and go...

09:13.093 --> 09:14.845
Hey, Mom.
Hey, Tyler.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.677
Just trying to figure out
the exact serving size

09:16.677 --> 09:18.979
of snow cone that will not
cause brain freeze.

09:20.230 --> 09:21.231
( grunts )

09:21.231 --> 09:23.103
Brain freeze?

09:23.103 --> 09:26.566
No, I just remembered
I forgot to pay the cable bill!

09:26.566 --> 09:28.358
So, how was your day?

09:28.358 --> 09:30.190
What did you learn at school?
What's new?

09:31.992 --> 09:33.243
( sighs )

09:33.243 --> 09:35.405
Listen, Mom, everyone at school
is mad at me

09:35.405 --> 09:37.788
because you're making
the carnival really uncool.

09:37.788 --> 09:39.660
I have friends who are
planning on staying home

09:39.660 --> 09:41.411
and reading, that night.

09:41.411 --> 09:42.833
They may have been
exaggerating to make a point,

09:42.833 --> 09:45.205
but still,
it's really serious.

09:45.205 --> 09:47.467
Well, Tyler, those kids
all look up to you.

09:47.467 --> 09:49.209
If you say
the care-nival's cool,

09:49.209 --> 09:51.011
then they'll all get
on board.

09:51.011 --> 09:52.262
Unless...

09:52.262 --> 09:53.343
Unless what?

09:53.343 --> 09:55.175
Unless
you're not that cool.

09:55.175 --> 09:56.386
( scoffs )

09:56.386 --> 09:57.557
Fine.

09:57.557 --> 09:59.059
I accept the challenge.

09:59.059 --> 10:00.641
I can make anything cool.

10:00.641 --> 10:03.023
I accidentally wore one of
your shirts to school one day,

10:03.023 --> 10:06.566
and thus began the trend
of the urban blouse.

10:08.649 --> 10:11.151
Wish I had that kind of
influence as a teenager.

10:11.151 --> 10:12.442
I would have
used it for good.

10:12.442 --> 10:14.825
No, you wouldn't have.

10:14.825 --> 10:16.406
Wait, how did Chloe
take losing at checkers?

10:16.406 --> 10:18.158
I couldn't win.

10:18.158 --> 10:20.661
All these years, I thought
I was letting her win,

10:20.661 --> 10:23.623
but apparently,
I'm just really bad.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.086
I am a grown man
with a PhD,

10:26.086 --> 10:28.418
who cannot beat
a seven-year-old at checkers

10:28.418 --> 10:29.670
when we play for realsies!

10:31.091 --> 10:33.303
Oh, Bennett,
don't make me laugh.

10:33.303 --> 10:35.015
You know my air sac's tender.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.182
I tried talking to Wes
like you said, Stan,

10:42.182 --> 10:44.314
and he just blew me
off again.

10:44.314 --> 10:45.645
And then I got
a text from him saying

10:45.645 --> 10:47.027
he's coming over here
to talk to me.

10:47.027 --> 10:48.318
Ooh, that's not good.

10:48.318 --> 10:49.399
Talking's always bad.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.610
You told me to talk to him.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.362
And look what happened.

10:52.362 --> 10:53.323
He's coming over here
to break up with you!

10:53.323 --> 10:54.574
Break up with me?

10:54.574 --> 10:56.196
Whoa, who said that?

10:56.196 --> 10:57.948
You said that!
Well, don't listen to me.

10:57.948 --> 10:58.989
I'm the one who suggested
you talk to him,

10:58.989 --> 11:00.450
and look how that turned out.

11:00.450 --> 11:02.412
He's coming over here
to break up with you!

11:03.413 --> 11:04.705
Why do you keep saying that?

11:04.705 --> 11:06.286
I don't know!

11:06.286 --> 11:07.748
What else would he want to
talk to you about at home,

11:07.748 --> 11:09.249
that he couldn't say at school?

11:09.249 --> 11:10.340
He doesn't
want to make a scene.

11:10.340 --> 11:11.671
That's right!

11:11.671 --> 11:13.423
So, he's gonna come
over here and say,

11:13.423 --> 11:15.465
"Avery, it's not working.

11:15.465 --> 11:18.558
You're high strung, and you
creepily hid in my locker."

11:19.559 --> 11:20.931
And then you'll say,

11:20.931 --> 11:22.642
"Wes, can't we
just talk about it?"

11:22.642 --> 11:24.765
And he'll say,
"There's nothing to talk about.

11:24.765 --> 11:25.936
"We're breaking up.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.108
You're acting crazy!"

11:28.108 --> 11:29.109
Hey, Avery, I--

11:29.109 --> 11:30.270
I'll show you crazy!

11:30.270 --> 11:31.311
Hey!

11:31.311 --> 11:32.402
STAN: Bam!

11:32.402 --> 11:33.904
Ow!

11:33.904 --> 11:35.315
What was that?

11:35.315 --> 11:37.277
I just whacked you
with a mallet, bro.

11:38.618 --> 11:40.620
I came over here
to apologize.

11:40.620 --> 11:42.873
I blame the mallet.

11:42.873 --> 11:44.374
I'm so sorry.

11:44.374 --> 11:45.876
I just assumed you
were coming over here

11:45.876 --> 11:46.917
to break up with me.

11:46.917 --> 11:48.038
( sighs )

11:48.038 --> 11:50.460
It's almost as bad.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.461
My family's moving.

11:53.093 --> 11:54.714
Why didn't you tell me
this was happening?

11:54.714 --> 11:58.298
I wanted to.
I just couldn't.

11:58.298 --> 11:59.890
It would've made it too real.

11:59.890 --> 12:02.262
We leave on Thursday.

12:02.262 --> 12:04.394
I don't even get to go
to the carnival on Friday.

12:05.645 --> 12:07.347
I can't believe this.

12:09.349 --> 12:10.730
STAN: You know
what I can't believe?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.402
I have the same urban blouse.

12:23.203 --> 12:25.205
You know, just 'cause
you're moving doesn't mean

12:25.205 --> 12:26.827
we can't make this work.

12:26.827 --> 12:29.369
We could email,
text, video chat.

12:29.369 --> 12:31.371
We're young.
Our parents pay the bills.

12:31.371 --> 12:33.543
This is our time.

12:33.543 --> 12:36.426
The thing is,
I've moved a lot.

12:36.426 --> 12:37.587
And when you're not
in the same school,

12:37.587 --> 12:39.139
you pretty much lose touch.

12:39.139 --> 12:41.802
Well, that's true
for normal people.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.343
But I'm abnormally
determined.

12:43.343 --> 12:45.435
I once won a staring
contest with a fish.

12:45.435 --> 12:47.307
Fish don't blink.

12:47.307 --> 12:48.849
That's an important piece of
information for that story.

12:50.350 --> 12:53.193
And we really like
each other, right?

12:53.193 --> 12:54.524
Right.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.527
I like you even though
you threw snow cone at me.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.240
It got all down
my urban blouse.

13:05.866 --> 13:07.868
I have an announcement.

13:07.868 --> 13:10.330
Bunny slippers are now cool.

13:11.872 --> 13:13.914
ALL: Yeah!

13:13.914 --> 13:17.587
And they will henceforth
be known as street hops.

13:17.587 --> 13:19.089
Yeah!

13:19.089 --> 13:20.260
Cute.

13:20.260 --> 13:21.471
You know what else is cool?

13:21.471 --> 13:22.632
The care-nival.

13:22.632 --> 13:24.094
ALL: Boo!

13:24.094 --> 13:25.425
No way.

13:25.425 --> 13:27.477
What? Come on,
I just made bunny slippers cool.

13:27.477 --> 13:30.270
Over-the-top excessive
safety is even cooler.

13:30.270 --> 13:32.272
What about
the cotton ball toss?

13:32.272 --> 13:35.735
Whoa, it's getting
wild up in here.

13:36.776 --> 13:38.238
( murmuring )

13:38.238 --> 13:39.900
This is not the same guy
who came up

13:39.900 --> 13:41.571
with street hops
and the urban blouse.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.403
This is a real
low point for you.

13:43.403 --> 13:44.865
ALL: Yeah!

13:47.037 --> 13:48.708
Avery, I'm still the same guy
who came up with street hops

13:48.708 --> 13:50.370
and the urban blouse, right?

13:50.370 --> 13:53.583
I'm just gonna say "yes,"
and move on to my thing.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.215
Wes is leaving tomorrow,

13:55.215 --> 13:56.416
so we're gonna
have a long distance

13:56.416 --> 13:57.797
relationship like
you and Nikki.

13:57.797 --> 13:58.798
Any tips?

13:58.798 --> 14:00.220
Yeah, don't.

14:00.220 --> 14:01.261
What?

14:01.261 --> 14:02.842
It's too much.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.095
Uh, right now, life is all about
what goes on at school.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.306
You don't want to miss out

14:06.306 --> 14:07.517
on your whole
high school experience,

14:07.517 --> 14:09.139
homecoming, prom,

14:09.139 --> 14:11.021
spreading weird rumors
about your sister.

14:11.021 --> 14:14.434
Is that why everyone keeps
asking to see my whale spout?

14:14.434 --> 14:16.186
Yes. Yes, it is.

14:17.687 --> 14:20.480
Look, texting or talking
to a computer screen

14:20.480 --> 14:22.362
is not the same
as being with a person.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.863
Trust me.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
Well, if the long distance
thing is so bad,

14:25.865 --> 14:27.327
then why are you
and Nikki doing it?

14:27.327 --> 14:29.329
Because she's coming back.

14:31.701 --> 14:33.493
You look nice.

14:33.493 --> 14:34.664
So do you.

14:35.956 --> 14:37.337
I got my mom to make
grilled cheese.

14:37.337 --> 14:39.339
And I've got
the tomato soup.

14:39.339 --> 14:41.171
But don't worry,
my mom didn't make it.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.716
I wonder what lunch
at your new school

14:46.716 --> 14:47.717
will be like.

14:47.717 --> 14:49.349
It won't be like this.

14:51.771 --> 14:53.433
Or this.

14:53.433 --> 14:56.276
Our hands will be a couple
thousand miles away.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.320
You're still here,
but it feels like

15:00.320 --> 15:01.361
we're already apart.

15:01.361 --> 15:03.323
I know.

15:03.323 --> 15:04.945
All I can think about is
how sad I'm gonna be

15:04.945 --> 15:07.197
when I leave.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.238
I'm sorry
this is happening.

15:08.238 --> 15:10.450
It's not your fault.

15:10.450 --> 15:12.332
I'm still sorry.

15:14.744 --> 15:16.456
Is it possible
you were right,

15:16.456 --> 15:18.588
that we'll lose touch
if we're not in the same school?

15:18.588 --> 15:20.460
I think so.

15:24.254 --> 15:25.255
So, we're breaking up?

15:27.807 --> 15:29.309
I'm really gonna miss you.

15:29.309 --> 15:31.221
Me too.

15:43.773 --> 15:45.405
So, how did checkers go?

15:45.405 --> 15:48.868
I lost, but I did discover
a design flaw in the board

15:48.868 --> 15:50.410
when you hold it out
in front of you

15:50.410 --> 15:52.032
and put your foot through it.

15:53.413 --> 15:55.415
Took him a couple
of times to do his.

15:55.415 --> 15:57.377
I did mine on the first try.

15:57.377 --> 15:59.339
Big girl in the house!

16:02.792 --> 16:04.344
Hey, hon.

16:04.344 --> 16:07.137
Well, I found out
my cool has limits.

16:07.137 --> 16:09.049
And a little bit
of me died today.

16:10.050 --> 16:11.391
Me too.

16:11.391 --> 16:13.053
A dart went
into my fourth toe.

16:13.053 --> 16:15.435
And now, for some reason
I can't feel my right arm.

16:15.435 --> 16:17.307
But it's all
for the greater good.

16:19.359 --> 16:21.731
That's why at this
year's care-nival,

16:21.731 --> 16:23.863
we won't be
throwing darts at balloons.

16:23.863 --> 16:28.028
We'll be throwing
balloons at balloons.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.320
Fun.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.242
What a challenge.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.664
Mom, no one's gonna show up
at the care-nival.

16:34.664 --> 16:36.376
It's not gonna be fun.

16:36.376 --> 16:39.169
Is no one remembering
last year's carnival?

16:39.169 --> 16:41.381
So many people got injured.
Is that fun?

16:41.381 --> 16:42.332
No, it is not!

16:42.332 --> 16:44.334
Well, look at this
injury report.

16:45.965 --> 16:47.547
Eight people.

16:47.547 --> 16:49.839
Oh, look, the medic's
reports are all attached.

16:50.890 --> 16:53.723
This one's me.

16:55.345 --> 16:58.558
This one's also me.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.062
( grunts )

17:02.062 --> 17:03.523
Right in the eyeball.

17:07.407 --> 17:09.239
Mama's going down.

17:13.413 --> 17:14.954
Clavicle!

17:16.496 --> 17:18.418
Those were all just you.

17:18.418 --> 17:20.790
Look, I'm fine with safety
when it makes sense.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.582
I wear a helmet
and pads on my bike.

17:22.582 --> 17:24.794
But the carnival
isn't unsafe.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.756
You're accident prone.

17:26.756 --> 17:28.928
Mom, do you really
want to be known as the woman

17:28.928 --> 17:30.430
who destroyed the carnival?

17:30.430 --> 17:32.432
Maybe I did go overboard.

17:32.432 --> 17:34.434
I'll reinstate
the games and rides.

17:34.434 --> 17:35.345
Cool.

17:36.976 --> 17:38.808
Ooh, tingly.
It's waking up.

17:42.142 --> 17:43.523
You're not going
to the carnival?

17:43.523 --> 17:45.024
I'm too sad.

17:45.024 --> 17:47.777
But the carnival is
full of so much great food.

17:47.777 --> 17:50.400
It'll take your mind off
your break up with funnel cake.

17:51.281 --> 17:52.282
You mean Wes?

17:52.282 --> 17:54.154
Isn't that what I said?

17:54.154 --> 17:57.117
Come on, let's go to the
carnival, pickle on a stick.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.789
It's not even about Wes
at this point.

17:59.789 --> 18:02.622
What's really crushing me
is that I pushed Max

18:02.622 --> 18:04.204
and Lindsay away.

18:04.204 --> 18:06.045
Feeling bad about Wes
has made me realize

18:06.045 --> 18:07.587
that the two people

18:07.587 --> 18:10.420
I need the most don't want
anything to do with me.

18:10.420 --> 18:13.012
I lost my boyfriend
and my best friends.

18:13.012 --> 18:17.717
Come on, giant turkey leg
and kettle corn love you.

18:17.717 --> 18:20.600
And if you've taught me
anything about friendship,

18:20.600 --> 18:23.893
it's that when you're friends,
you forgive each other.

18:23.893 --> 18:25.225
Just like you forgave me

18:25.225 --> 18:26.776
when I threw up
under your bed.

18:26.776 --> 18:28.228
You threw up under my bed?

18:28.228 --> 18:31.491
A wet burp got loose,
we'll talk later.

18:31.491 --> 18:34.574
You'll forgive me,
just like they'll forgive you.

18:34.574 --> 18:36.196
You're right, Stan.

18:36.196 --> 18:38.238
I'll see them
and start to apologize,

18:38.238 --> 18:40.039
and they'll say,

18:40.039 --> 18:42.202
"Avery, just the fact that
you've come to us says it all.

18:42.202 --> 18:44.204
We forgive you
and accept your behavior

18:44.204 --> 18:46.416
without question or judgment."

18:46.416 --> 18:48.248
Thank you, guys,
for forgiving me

18:48.248 --> 18:51.050
and accepting my behavior
without question or judgment.

18:51.050 --> 18:52.672
We haven't done
any of those things.

18:52.672 --> 18:54.424
Okay, phew, I thought
I missed something.

18:55.595 --> 18:57.427
Oh, right.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.018
I'm so sorry.

18:59.018 --> 19:00.430
I totally took
our friendship for granted.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.602
I will never do it again.

19:02.602 --> 19:04.684
Can you please take me back
and let me sing with you?

19:04.684 --> 19:06.145
What about your boyfriend?

19:06.145 --> 19:08.228
Wes is moving.

19:08.228 --> 19:10.480
So we broke up.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.861
Well, I'm so sorry, Avery.

19:11.861 --> 19:13.273
I'm sorry too.

19:13.273 --> 19:16.276
If only it was Rick
who was moving away.

19:16.276 --> 19:17.407
Becca's husband.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.950
Thanks, you guys.

19:20.950 --> 19:22.332
I love
that we're friends.

19:25.495 --> 19:27.587
But you have to promise
when we have serious boyfriends

19:27.587 --> 19:29.499
and blow you off,
you have to forgive us.

19:29.499 --> 19:31.090
You mean "long-term"
boyfriends.

19:31.090 --> 19:32.592
All my boyfriends
will be serious.

19:32.592 --> 19:34.294
By which I mean
grave and pensive.

19:34.294 --> 19:35.345
You know that.

19:38.348 --> 19:41.100
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

19:41.100 --> 19:42.802
Yes! Yes!

19:42.802 --> 19:44.354
I did it!

19:44.354 --> 19:45.565
I won!

19:45.565 --> 19:47.977
Your clown's going
home thirsty.

19:47.977 --> 19:49.269
What?

19:50.440 --> 19:51.941
Did Daddy teach you
how to lose?

19:51.941 --> 19:54.274
Yeah, he did.
Yeah, he did.

19:54.274 --> 19:55.485
Yes--

19:55.485 --> 19:56.656
It's okay.

19:56.656 --> 19:58.658
I'm a child psychologist.

19:58.658 --> 20:01.120
And she's been beating me
a lot at checkers.

20:02.782 --> 20:04.664
Psst!

20:04.664 --> 20:08.207
So, you threw that game to
make your dad feel better, huh?

20:08.207 --> 20:11.501
Duh, I'm not some punk baby
losing at squirt-a-clown.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.212
That's my jam.

20:15.295 --> 20:16.296
Oh, careful.

20:16.296 --> 20:18.338
Baby bites.
Just keep it tiny.

20:20.139 --> 20:22.302
Sorry I couldn't make
the care-nival cool,

20:22.302 --> 20:24.514
but I can still make
almost anything else cool,

20:24.514 --> 20:26.396
including going on a ride
with my mom.

20:26.396 --> 20:29.689
Oh, that would be
really nice, Tyler.

20:29.689 --> 20:31.311
Hey, those look like
my slippers.

20:33.733 --> 20:34.854
Come on, Mom,

STAN: So, Avery
and her friends

21:55.194 --> 21:56.986
patched things up

21:56.986 --> 21:59.028
'cause that's just what
friends do.

21:59.028 --> 22:01.280
That thought is stuck
in my head for some reason,

22:01.280 --> 22:02.942
don't know why.

22:02.942 --> 22:04.494
The important thing is,

22:04.494 --> 22:06.906
Avery realized how much
her friends mean to her.

22:06.906 --> 22:09.619
'Cause in the end,
she really is a great friend.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.290
I can vouch for that.

22:11.290 --> 22:12.662
She won me a teddy bear.

22:12.662 --> 22:15.124
Which I gave to
my friend, Robert.

22:15.124 --> 22:16.666
Don't tell Avery.
