00:02.127 --> 00:04.880
Trudy: Good morning everyone,
just a few announcements.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.716
Would the midget girls
volleyball team please meet in

00:07.716 --> 00:10.886
room 324 after school for
an important meeting.

00:10.886 --> 00:14.055
Congratulations to the midget
boys' soccer team who defeated

00:14.055 --> 00:16.934
St. Pat's by a score
of 2-1 yesterday.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.227
Gerry: Ah hmmm
Trudy: Way to go boys!

00:19.227 --> 00:24.525
Oh, and just one
more thing, the midget
boys' basketball team lost

00:24.525 --> 00:29.488
a heartbreaker to York
Secondary, 56-55, too bad boys,

00:29.488 --> 00:33.617
unfortunately you just came
up a little short. Thank you.

00:33.617 --> 00:38.288
What's wrong with you?
Ah for the love of...

00:43.878 --> 00:46.421
Gerry: Sorry about that stuff.
Man: Sorry about what?

00:46.421 --> 00:49.299
Gerry: You didn't hear the
whole...announcements?

00:49.299 --> 00:52.219
Man: No.
Gerry: Hey, do you know a girl

00:52.219 --> 00:54.889
named Julie Simpson? She's
a friend of mine...

00:54.889 --> 00:56.097
Man: Little Julie?
Gerry: Yeah.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.474
Man: Yeah, yeah.
Gerry: Really?

00:57.474 --> 00:59.393
Wow, small world.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.439
♪ I'm awesome. No you're
not dude don't lie.

01:04.439 --> 01:07.108
♪ I'm awesome. I'm driving
around in my mom's ride.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.904
♪ I'm awesome. A quarter
of my life gone by.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.616
♪ I'm awesome, awesome,
awesome.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.245
Gerry: Hey Bobbi.
Hey...Bob...

01:18.245 --> 01:21.040
What's her problem?
Lisa: Oh, she has to teach

01:21.040 --> 01:23.000
health today to the
grade fivers.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.460
Gerry: Ooh, the worst!
Lisa: Yeah, I can imagine.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.421
Gerry: No, you can't imagine.
Let me tell you something about

01:27.421 --> 01:30.173
being a phys-ed teacher. That's
the worst part, having to teach

01:30.173 --> 01:33.510
the kids about sex-ed and
puberty and you know why we

01:33.510 --> 01:36.263
have to teach it? Because their
parents won't tell them. So we

01:36.263 --> 01:38.933
will tell them. Other teachers
don't do it. They shove them to

01:38.933 --> 01:40.893
the phys-ed teacher.
Lisa: Ok, first of all, you're

01:40.893 --> 01:43.062
not a phys-ed teacher.
Gerry: Technically, I have a

01:43.062 --> 01:45.397
degree in Kinesiology, which
makes me a phys-ed teacher.

01:45.397 --> 01:49.276
Lisa: Secondly, phys-ed teachers
mainly play dodgeball. So...

01:49.276 --> 01:53.405
Gerry: Ok, yeah that's what we
do, we just play dodgeball.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.657
So, you think teaching phys-ed
is easier than teaching

01:55.657 --> 01:57.618
anything else?
Lisa: Yeah, yeah, that's

01:57.618 --> 02:00.913
what I'm saying.
Gerry: Yeah, yeah, oh man.

02:00.913 --> 02:03.331
Callaghan: Hey guys.
Lisa, I don't know

02:03.331 --> 02:05.333
if you've heard that
Mr. Wilkins has taken

02:05.333 --> 02:07.544
a leave of absence.
Gerry: Hold on, who?

02:07.544 --> 02:10.171
Lisa: Yes, that's terrible. I
hope he gets better soon.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.215
Gerry: Hey! Is that the guy
that looks like a hawk?

02:12.215 --> 02:15.302
Callaghan: Bottom line, I need
you to take over the Quiz Cup

02:15.302 --> 02:17.972
Academic team and I want you to
find someone to give you a hand.

02:17.972 --> 02:21.224
Gerry: Hold it. We have
an academic team here?

02:21.224 --> 02:23.894
Lisa: Yes, absolutely.
I'm happy to help.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.312
Callaghan: Let me know if
you need some help with that.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.688
Gerry: I can help with that,

02:26.688 --> 02:28.732
umm, hello?

02:28.732 --> 02:31.902
I'm quite a trivia buff right
here. I am on it.

02:31.902 --> 02:35.823
Callaghan: Hey, Gerry.
How's it goin'?
Gerry: Hey sir.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.868
I am here.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.455
Yeah, right here.

02:45.916 --> 02:49.670
Trudy, am I here today?
Yeah, good ok. Thank you.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.047
Robert: Morning, Trudy.
Trudy: Good morning.

02:52.047 --> 02:55.717
Here are the questions for the
academic competition against...

02:55.717 --> 02:59.513
Robert: Oh, oh, doesn't matter
who it's against. The impartial

02:59.513 --> 03:02.181
quiz master thanks you.
Trudy: You're welcome.

03:02.181 --> 03:03.684
Robert: You didn't leave
these unattended did you?

03:03.684 --> 03:05.853
Trudy: Uhhh, must we do
this every year?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.813
Robert: Yes, we do. It's a
matter of security.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.314
Trudy: Didn't leave
them unattended.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.025
Robert: Good.
Trudy: Mmmhmmm.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.276
Robert: Why'd you use two sticky
things, could have gotten

03:13.276 --> 03:17.614
away with just one. Boop. Office
supplies are expensive Truders,

03:17.614 --> 03:19.908
and I think we both also know
that these things don't grow on

03:19.908 --> 03:23.453
trees. [Trudy laughs]
Callaghan: Oh, did I miss it?

03:23.453 --> 03:27.166
Trudy [laughing]: You did, ya
missed it. It was great too.

03:27.166 --> 03:30.251
Robert: Oh.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.131
Trudy: Ta da!

03:34.131 --> 03:37.009
[Robert's shoes squeak
in the spilled coffee]

03:39.178 --> 03:44.016
Trudy: That was rich.
Who's cleaning this up?

03:44.016 --> 03:47.519
Gerry: Lisa. So I really think I
can help you. I mean, have you

03:47.519 --> 03:49.354
ever coached?
Lisa: No, but I think I can

03:49.354 --> 03:51.398
figure it out.
Gerry: Ok, I've coached. Hey, I

03:51.398 --> 03:53.316
memorized Pi to 26
decimal places.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.819
Lisa: Ok, you just want to do
this because Callaghan

03:55.819 --> 03:57.946
thinks you can't.
Gerry: No, I'm good at trivia.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.990
I love trivia. Trust me,
I can help.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.700
Lisa: Ok.
Gerry: Yes.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.536
Lisa: We practice after school.
Gerry: Practice?

04:04.536 --> 04:07.372
We're sitting here
talking about practice?
Lisa: Yeah.

04:07.372 --> 04:11.334
Gerry: Practice? Not a game.
Not a game. Practice?

04:11.334 --> 04:15.089
We talking about practice? Not a
game. Not a game that I live

04:15.089 --> 04:18.341
die for, but we're talking
about practice? Practice?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.219
Lisa: Really, you lost me. I
don't know what you're

04:20.219 --> 04:22.345
talking about.
Gerry: Alan Iverson, basketball

04:22.345 --> 04:24.389
player. See? I can help.
Lisa: Still don't know.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.184
Alright, 3:30, ok?
Gerry: Ok, oh hey

04:27.184 --> 04:31.563
3.1415926535897

04:31.563 --> 04:37.069
9323846264338.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.988
That's Pi, to 26 decimal places.

04:39.988 --> 04:43.992
Bobbi: Ok, so overt menstruation
occurs primarily with humans and

04:43.992 --> 04:47.913
also close evolutionary primates
such as chimpanzees.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.706
Cassandra: Is that a bad thing?
Bobbi: No, no, menstruation

04:49.706 --> 04:52.542
isn't a bad thing. It's really
the major stage of a girl's

04:52.542 --> 04:55.254
puberty and the first stage
of becoming a woman.

04:55.254 --> 04:58.257
Stephan: Does it hurt?
Bobbi: No, Stephan, menstruation

04:58.257 --> 05:00.217
itself doesn't hurt, but
sometimes there's muscle

05:00.217 --> 05:03.845
contractions that go
along with it that do. Yeah?

05:03.845 --> 05:06.306
Lucy: What does
being in love mean?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.271
Bobbi: Not really what
we're talking about right now.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.982
Lucy: But, Ms. Galka,
you're teaching
us about boy/girl

05:14.982 --> 05:18.860
things right?
Bobbi: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

05:18.860 --> 05:21.529
sure I am.
Lucy: Ok, so what does being in

05:21.529 --> 05:26.827
love mean?
Bobbi: Ok, ok, ah ok so being in

05:26.827 --> 05:33.333
love, being in love is when a
boy and a girl

05:33.333 --> 05:35.127
really care for each other.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.336
Really care for each other.
That's it.

05:37.336 --> 05:40.007
Leah: My daddy said my mommy
left him because she fell in

05:40.007 --> 05:44.928
love with another woman.
Bobbi: Ok. Alright. That's

05:44.928 --> 05:49.390
another. You guys, just, let's
just talk about menstruation.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.227
Right?
Stephan: Do boys get mentation?

05:52.227 --> 05:54.980
Bobbi: Menstruation Stephan.
No they don't get menstruation.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.815
Stephan: Then why is
the word men in it?

05:56.815 --> 05:58.566
Bobbi: I don't know.

05:58.566 --> 06:03.030
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.906
Gerry: Hello, hello.
Lisa: Hey Gerry.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.659
Gerry: So you're on the team?
Did you tell them the good news?

06:07.659 --> 06:09.911
Lisa: Not yet. Mr. Duncan
is actually gonna be...

06:09.911 --> 06:12.956
Gerry: ...coaching the team.
Lisa: Co-coaching the team.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.624
Maya: Why?
Gerry: Why? What do you mean

06:14.624 --> 06:16.501
why, Maya?
Noah: Hey, sorry I'm late.

06:16.501 --> 06:20.839
Gerry: Noah, try to be on time
please. Punctuality is key, ok?

06:20.839 --> 06:24.467
We have a new coach. So I have
a little different structure.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.385
Lisa: Co-coach.
Gerry: Be on time.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.013
Maya: But, you're
always late for class.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.223
Gerry: I am, am I? When I coach?

06:29.223 --> 06:31.058
Have you seen me coach?
Never late.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.476
Like clockwork when
I coach. What is the longest

06:33.476 --> 06:35.645
river in the world?
Noah: The Nile.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.066
Gerry: No, Noah. It's the
Mississippi. See, when you're

06:39.066 --> 06:41.818
late, you might not know stuff.
Maya: It is definitely
the Nile.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.778
Mindy: Mississippi's
the third longest.

06:43.778 --> 06:46.573
Gerry: Well, smarty pants, the
Colorado River is the

06:46.573 --> 06:50.035
second longest in the world.
Betcha didn't know that.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.204
Maya: The Amazon is the
second longest river.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.497
[Bell sounds]
Gerry: We'll never know,

06:54.497 --> 06:56.708
'cause I have to go.

07:03.215 --> 07:07.802
Robert: TRUDY! That's not funny.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.971
What if I had a parent in there
when that screen saver came up?

07:09.971 --> 07:12.724
Trudy: Well then, obviously
Robert they would just think
that you really

07:12.724 --> 07:15.185
like sexy clowns.
Callaghan: Did I miss it again?

07:15.185 --> 07:17.687
Trudy: Yes.
Robert: Sir, please it's not

07:17.687 --> 07:20.690
funny. She's really starting to
impede my ability to do my job.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.777
Callaghan: Oh, Robert, chillax.
It's a joke. Grow a spine.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.863
Fight back. [Laughing]
Trudy: I know. [Laughing]

07:26.863 --> 07:29.616
[Imitates laughing]
Trudy: Grow a spine Robert.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.492
Robert: I have one thanks.

07:31.492 --> 07:36.290
If it's a war you want,
it's a war you got lady!

07:36.290 --> 07:38.833
Trudy: Bring it.
Robert: I'm just goin'

07:38.833 --> 07:41.711
to get it.
Trudy: Hope you can find it.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.546
Robert: If I was the person
who put it there I guess I

07:43.546 --> 07:45.340
would be the one who
knows where it is.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.606
Gerry: Ah man, this is boring.
Is this how you guys practice

08:01.606 --> 08:05.735
for real? Just sit there? And
stare at things? Let's get some

08:05.735 --> 08:08.989
questions goin' here. Maya,
which one of Henry VIII's wives

08:08.989 --> 08:11.241
gave birth
to Elizabeth

08:11.241 --> 08:13.743
the one, first?
Maya: Anne Boleyn.

08:13.743 --> 08:17.038
Gerry: Correct. But,
you didn't buzz.
Maya: What?

08:17.038 --> 08:19.458
You gotta buzz soon as
you hear the question,
as soon as it starts, buzz,

08:19.458 --> 08:21.751
gain control of the board.
Lisa: How are they supposed to

08:21.751 --> 08:23.962
buzz when they don't
even know the question?

08:23.962 --> 08:25.880
Gerry: You don't need to know
the whole question, you need to

08:25.880 --> 08:28.008
know the start of the question
and then you gain control by

08:28.008 --> 08:30.427
buzzing. For instance, if they
ask you "which country has the

08:30.427 --> 08:33.305
capital..." right away you know
the answer is a country. You now

08:33.305 --> 08:36.057
have control of the board, boom,
we're one step ahead of them.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.393
Maya: But sir, there's 196
countries in the world.

08:38.393 --> 08:41.313
Gerry: Then there's 196
capitals, start learning. I know

08:41.313 --> 08:44.024
my capitals, ask me a
capital of a country.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.651
Mindy: Australia?
Gerry: Come on, Canberra. Easy.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.278
Please. Next?
Maya: Iceland?

08:48.278 --> 08:51.156
Gerry: Reykjavik. Easy Maya.
Noah: Madagascar?

08:51.156 --> 08:56.661
Gerry: Countries! Countries was
the question. Not islands. Ok?

08:56.661 --> 08:59.873
Want to know the capital of
Gilligan's Island too? Is that

08:59.873 --> 09:03.251
fun to you? Just throwing out
bizarre answers? If you don't

09:03.251 --> 09:06.587
know the capitals, Noah, at
least know your countries. OK?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.970
Gerry: Ahh, heard you're
starting the health unit.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.056
Bobbi: Yeah, kind of the worst
part of teaching phys-ed.

09:16.056 --> 09:19.351
You know?
Gerry: Well, if you want me to
come in on my spare and help
I will.

09:19.351 --> 09:23.313
Bobbi: Yeah, oh no,
that's ok. Thanks.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.900
Gerry: Suit yourself. But let it
be known that I have quite a way

09:26.900 --> 09:31.154
with young kids and sex. What I
mean is, I have quite a way of

09:31.154 --> 09:34.574
explaining sex to
young...I have...

09:37.244 --> 09:39.538
I know how to make it
fun. I know how

09:39.538 --> 09:43.917
to make sex education fun.
Bobbi: Got it.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.835
Gerry: Let me know
if you need me.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.171
Bobbi: Won't be changing
my mind. Thanks.

09:48.171 --> 09:51.716
I just have to open it up to
questions. I just have to spend

09:51.716 --> 09:54.635
the whole class just answering
questions, it'll be easy.

09:54.635 --> 09:58.181
Malik: Who did things?
Bobbi: I'm sorry, I was just,
um,

09:58.181 --> 10:00.308
I was just talking
out loud. Sorry.

10:00.308 --> 10:04.563
Malik: Ah, yes. Two voices in
the head is a danger maze.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.981
Bobbi: Yeah, yeah
you're kind of right.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.443
Malik: I have a melancholy.
Bobbi: What does that mean?

10:09.443 --> 10:12.404
Malik: I used to have
girlfriends,

10:12.404 --> 10:14.614
they want out, I want in.
Bobbi: Yeah.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.451
Malik: They want out, I want in.
They want in, I want out.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.578
Bobbi: Okay.
Malik: So I say, I'm out!

10:19.578 --> 10:21.538
Bobbi: Yup.
Malik: Quick like Band-Aid.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.749
Bobbi: Ok, I get it. I just have
to suck it up right? I have to

10:24.749 --> 10:27.127
follow through with what's in
my heart anyway, right.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.963
Malik: Are you baby? Are you
Boobi?
Bobbi: No. No, I'm Bobbi.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.882
Malik: Yes, go, yes.
Bobbi: Yeah. What?

10:32.882 --> 10:34.717
Malik: Thank you!
Bobbi: Thank you!

10:34.717 --> 10:38.305
Malik: Good night.
Bobbi: Thanks Anon Da Shon Rum.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.557
Malik: RIIIIPPPP!
Bobbi: Thanks for listening.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.683
Gerry: Alright, we're getting
close. Hands on your buzzer.

10:42.683 --> 10:46.104
Mindy: My hand is sore.
Lisa: Her hand is sore.

10:46.104 --> 10:49.357
Come on, this isn't helping.
Gerry: Please. In what year...?

10:49.357 --> 10:51.276
[Noah rings buzzer]
Noah: 1975.

10:51.276 --> 10:55.280
Gerry: Ok, good that you knew it
was a year, but in what year did

10:55.280 --> 10:58.450
the revolutionary war begin?
1975 Noah? Seriously?

10:58.450 --> 11:01.244
Noah: 1775?
Gerry: Yeah, way off ok?

11:01.244 --> 11:04.122
Gerry: Alright, what...
[Mindy rings buzzer]

11:05.706 --> 11:07.708
Gerry: What are you doin'?
On "what" you're buzzing in?

11:07.708 --> 11:10.086
Mindy: Yeah, but, you said to...
Gerry: I just said what, that's

11:10.086 --> 11:12.422
not enough words, you can't
guess the question from "what".

11:12.422 --> 11:14.799
There could be a trillion
possible questions.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.717
How many zero's in a trillion?
Maya: 12.

11:16.717 --> 11:20.514
Gerry: Good Maya, nice, but you
didn't buzz in. So not only did

11:20.514 --> 11:23.766
you give the answer to the team
above us, you also gave them

11:23.766 --> 11:27.145
control of the board.
Lisa: Ok, do you see how maybe

11:27.145 --> 11:30.524
they should listen and be
comfortable with their
answers before they buzz?

11:30.524 --> 11:32.233
Gerry: Yeah, we could do that.
Lisa: Yeah.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.235
Gerry: We could wait for
the whole question if you want,

11:34.235 --> 11:37.197
think, hmm, wonder what the
answer is, hit the buzzer,
too late!

11:37.197 --> 11:40.116
If you do that we might as well
watch them walk away with the
quiz cup.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.537
Lisa: Ok, ok. Team, how about
we're done for the day and so

11:43.537 --> 11:47.541
how 'bout we pack up our things.
Gerry, can I please speak with

11:47.541 --> 11:50.835
you in the hallway? Thank you.
Gerry: What is the Latin deri...

11:50.835 --> 11:53.754
See, as soon as I said Latin
somebody should have buzzed

11:53.754 --> 11:57.258
because you know the answer
is going to be a word.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.094
Gerry: Come on.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.683
Robert: Mr. Malik, thank you
for coming. Have a seat.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.017
Malik: Seat?

12:07.810 --> 12:10.605
So I know for a fact that you're
short on a few supplies right?

12:10.605 --> 12:16.152
Here's what I was thinking,
maybe you and I could figure out
a little "arrangement."

12:16.152 --> 12:19.573
Malik: Garbage sacks.
Robert: I can do that for you,

12:19.573 --> 12:25.370
but I'm hoping you can help me
with a little problem I'm having
with Trudy.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.998
Malik: I help all today.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.128
Gerry: I think they're
starting to get it.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.047
Lisa: Ok, Gerry,

12:36.047 --> 12:40.009
I really appreciate
that you're doing this to
help me out and everything,

12:40.009 --> 12:42.929
but I think our coaching styles
are really conflicting.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.847
Gerry: Ok I agree, a little bit.

12:44.847 --> 12:48.809
Lisa: Ok, because I don't think
that they need two coaches.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.938
Gerry: No. No, no, no, no, no.
Lisa: I'm sorry, I just...

12:51.938 --> 12:54.524
Don't you dare quit
on this team.

12:54.524 --> 12:59.279
Lisa: I'm not going to quit.
Gerry: Good, 'cause you are just

12:59.279 --> 13:03.366
as much a part of this as I am.
Keep your head up.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.713
Gerry: This is the finals?
Where is everybody?

13:16.713 --> 13:19.048
Lisa: Just the parents show up
for this. Ok you guys let's get

13:19.048 --> 13:22.677
a photo here of the team.
Gerry: Oh, wait, photo, photo.

13:22.677 --> 13:25.054
Lisa: Four of you...
Mindy: Here they come.

13:25.054 --> 13:29.100
Gerry: Oh my...
Oh what happened?

13:30.644 --> 13:34.397
Good for you,
getting involved and stuff, huh?

13:34.397 --> 13:39.110
Gonna answer some questions?
My name is Mr...
Brittany: Are you the addle-pate

13:39.110 --> 13:40.612
in charge of
this rabble?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.701
Gerry: Think so.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.789
Brittany: Well, rule #175 states

13:50.789 --> 13:55.168
and I quote "no electronic
devices of any kind permitted

13:55.168 --> 13:57.504
on any person's person".

13:57.504 --> 14:00.923
Gerry: Ok, we just want to get a
little picture...
Brittany: Rules are rules.

14:00.923 --> 14:06.262
Gerry: Ok. Oh ow.
Brittany: Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:06.262 --> 14:10.558
Gerry: She did that on purpose.
Maya: And she called
you a moron.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.102
Gerry: She called me apple
cake. Pay attention.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.146
Maya: I don't think so.
Gerry: Yeah apple cake, are you

14:15.146 --> 14:18.399
the apple cake in charge of
this team? It's a dessert.

14:18.399 --> 14:22.737
Lisa: It's addle-pate.
She called you a moron.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.823
Callaghan: Trudy, have you got
those papers I was asking for?

14:24.823 --> 14:27.367
Trudy: Oh, yes, they
are right here.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.786
[Phone rings]
Trudy: Here you go.

14:29.786 --> 14:33.914
Xavier Academy. May I help you?
[Malik on phone]: Hello Truby,

14:33.914 --> 14:37.794
your fridge run around guy
time. You better find it.

14:37.794 --> 14:42.382
Trudy: Oh, really Robert?
Is that all ya got?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.676
I'm telling you,
the man's an amateur.

14:44.676 --> 14:48.262
Callaghan: Whoa, are you ok?
Trudy: Ow.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.349
Robert [laughing]: Gotcha!
Callaghan: What have you done?

14:51.349 --> 14:54.101
Robert: A joke, I did a joke.
Callaghan: You think this

14:54.101 --> 14:57.438
is funny?
Robert: Well not right now.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.524
Callaghan: Are you ok? Just
stay--
Trudy: Yes, don't let him touch

14:59.524 --> 15:05.446
me. You, however, can
help yourself. Ow. Jeez.

15:05.446 --> 15:08.074
Trudy: Ow, god.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.494
Robert: Sorry I'm late.
Bit of an incident.

15:11.494 --> 15:14.080
York Secondary students,
welcome.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.499
My name is Robert Cheeley.
I'm the vice principal here,

15:16.499 --> 15:19.335
highly regarded
and what have you.
Gerry: Says who?

15:19.335 --> 15:23.548
But I want you to know as
your quiz master I will
be impartial and fair.

15:23.548 --> 15:27.635
Okay? So does anybody
need anything to make their stay
here a little more comfortable?

15:27.635 --> 15:30.388
Brittany: What? Because
I'm in a wheelchair?

15:30.388 --> 15:32.056
Gerry: Is there a
problem here?

15:32.056 --> 15:34.058
Brittany: Yeah, his
frontispiece.

15:34.058 --> 15:38.772
Gerry: What is that? Your suit?
Robert: No, my face.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.940
There's a problem
with my face.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.609
Would you excuse
us for a moment?

15:46.362 --> 15:49.365
Robert: Ms. Mason, as you
know rule 117 states that the

15:49.365 --> 15:52.619
visiting team should
be on the second tier.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.622
Lisa: Yeah, well, obviously
we can make an exception.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.458
Gerry: Noo. She started it, ok?
She tried to get in our kitchen.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.335
It's not gonna happen.
She's a mean, mean girl.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.170
Robert: Kitchen's closed.
Gerry: Thank you.

16:03.170 --> 16:06.507
Kitchen's closed.
Lisa: Ok, Gerry, there's no

16:06.507 --> 16:08.968
reason why they can't
take the bottom tier.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.221
Gerry: They're moving her now.
So it's too late to stop.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.432
Lisa: She's in a wheelchair.
Gerry: I'll try to stop them.

16:14.432 --> 16:15.975
Gerry quietly: Guys, you
don't need to do that.

16:15.975 --> 16:20.271
Don't worry about it.
Looks like a heavy wheelchair.

16:20.271 --> 16:23.065
Gerry: She called him something,
she called me something.

16:23.065 --> 16:27.862
Gerry: She's eyeballing us,
eyeball her back.

16:27.862 --> 16:32.032
She's an agitator. She agitates.
Lisa: Gerry.

16:32.032 --> 16:35.662
Gerry: She's mad at us. Don't
let this affect you guys.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.831
Lisa: Oh my gosh.
Gerry: There, they're up.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.416
Big deal, what did that take?
15 seconds?

16:40.416 --> 16:44.128
Ok, Brittany? You good?

16:46.046 --> 16:48.800
Gerry: We're good.
Let's go!

16:48.800 --> 16:53.721
Robert: Which of the following
countries does not border

16:53.721 --> 16:59.226
Brazil? Paraguay, Guyana, Peru,
Gerry: Peru.

16:59.226 --> 17:02.730
Robert: or Ecuador?
Brittany?

17:02.730 --> 17:04.691
Brittany: Ecuador.
Robert: Correct!

17:04.691 --> 17:07.401
Gerry: That's right,
Peru doesn't border it anymore.

17:07.401 --> 17:10.237
Robert: Next question. During
the Cuban missile crisis, in

17:10.237 --> 17:12.323
what country were the U.S.
missiles that threatened the

17:12.323 --> 17:18.412
Soviet Union? West Germany,
Finland, Turkey or India?

17:18.412 --> 17:20.790
Gerry: Australia.
Robert: Brittany?

17:20.790 --> 17:22.375
Brittany: Turkey.
Robert: That is correct.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.335
Lisa: That wasn't even
an option.

17:24.335 --> 17:27.213
Robert: York Secondary now with
54 points, Xavier in second

17:27.213 --> 17:30.132
place with a mere 22 points.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.678
As we turn our attention now to
this question.
Gerry: Time out.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.429
Robert: Mr. Duncan, there are
no times outs, I'm afraid.

17:35.429 --> 17:39.225
Gerry: Ah well Maya
needs her EpiPen. So...

17:39.225 --> 17:42.020
Robert: Judge, will you accept
EpiPen? Timeout granted for

17:42.020 --> 17:44.230
Xavier Academy,
clock starts now.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.899
Gerry: Shake when I do
this, just pretend.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.650
Maya: Ow! What
are you doing?

17:47.650 --> 17:51.111
Gerry: What's goin' on guys?
Turkey, missiles,

17:51.111 --> 17:53.113
everyone knows that.
Maya: Brittany's pretty
smart ok?

17:53.113 --> 17:56.116
Lisa: Hey, and you guys are
incredibly smart.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.870
So just relax.
Gerry: You guys focus.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.456
Lisa: No, they're not the
problem, ok? You're the problem.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.960
Brittany: Trouble in paradise?
Robert: Two minutes,
two minutes.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.005
Lisa: Gerry, and the kids
aren't having fun.
Maya: She's right.

18:09.005 --> 18:12.592
Gerry: No one's having fun.
So we're going to turn on me.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.302
That's how we do it when
we're losing. Mindy? Maya?

18:15.302 --> 18:19.473
Lisa: No, no Gerry, ok? Enough,
you are a really great coach,

18:19.473 --> 18:21.726
but let me coach them alright?
Gerry: Okay.

18:21.726 --> 18:26.522
Lisa: You guys, enjoy
yourselves. Have fun. Relax.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.482
Go for it!
Gerry: Victory speech.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.651
Robert: Time out's over,
time out's over.

18:30.651 --> 18:35.197
Bobbi: Ok, so a series of muscle
contractions delivers the

18:35.197 --> 18:38.659
male gametes through the cervix,
into the uterus and then into

18:38.659 --> 18:41.746
the fallopian tube. Any
questions? Go! Yup?

18:41.746 --> 18:44.331
Cassandra: Are you in a
relationship, Ms. Galka?

18:44.331 --> 18:46.584
Bobbi: Yes, I am, actually.

18:46.584 --> 18:50.922
Stephan: Are you in love with
him or her?
Bobbi: It's a him and why are

18:50.922 --> 18:54.550
you guys grilling me with
all these questions, right?

18:54.550 --> 18:58.178
Leah: Maybe you're in love with
another woman like my mommy is.

18:58.178 --> 19:03.643
Bobbi: No, I'm not. Ok, you know
what? Sometimes you think you're

19:03.643 --> 19:07.939
in love with someone right? And
it's kind of hard to admit to

19:07.939 --> 19:10.942
yourself that you're not in
love with somebody.

19:10.942 --> 19:13.360
Lucy: So you don't love him?

19:14.612 --> 19:17.197
[Bell rings]
Bobbi [quietly]: Oh, thank God.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.997
Stephan: Miss, if you don't
love this guy, why don't

19:23.997 --> 19:26.373
you just tell him?
Bobbi: 'Cause it's not that
easy,

19:26.373 --> 19:29.335
Stephan, I mean, you know we
live together and our names are

19:29.335 --> 19:33.798
on the lease and we just got a
dog, so, I have to love him.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.594
Bobbi: You get it, hey buddy?
Stephan: Yeah.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.848
Bobbi: Yeah. Thanks pal.

19:41.848 --> 19:45.225
Robert: York Secondary in the
lead with 76, Xavier Academy

19:45.225 --> 19:48.855
has 70. Now it's onto this
final, 10 point, winner take

19:48.855 --> 19:52.817
all question. When did the
revolutionary war begin?

19:52.817 --> 19:54.777
Carol?
Carol: 1774.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.863
Robert: Oh, incorrect
I'm afraid.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.157
Brittany: What are you doing?
Robert: Xavier, chance to steal.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.159
Same question. Maya?
Brittany: She didn't mean that.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.494
Maya: 1775.
Robert: That's correct!

20:03.494 --> 20:07.957
Xavier wins the quiz cup!
Brittany: You stupid idiot!

20:07.957 --> 20:09.876
Gerry: Oh, I understand
what she's saying now.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.252
Brittany: Wait, where you
going? What about me?

20:12.252 --> 20:15.756
Gerry: We did it.
Lisa: Yeah, well we did it,

20:15.756 --> 20:19.886
you're fired, ok? Alright.
Gerry: You can't fire me,

20:19.886 --> 20:23.139
you don't pay me to do this.
You can't fire somebody

20:23.139 --> 20:25.307
that volunteers.
Lisa: Let's go see your parents,

20:25.307 --> 20:27.267
they're going to be
so proud of you.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.356
Gerry: Well, who's the
apple cake now?

20:34.108 --> 20:38.362
Gerry: I gotta roll. Oh, no
offense. Lock up when

20:38.362 --> 20:42.825
you're done will ya?
Guys!?

20:44.284 --> 20:46.162
Bobbi: Hey, Trood.
You feeling better?

20:46.162 --> 20:48.622
Trudy: Ah, yeah well you
know, full of pain killers.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.709
Bobbi: Oh, yeah, um,
I have some big news.
Trudy: What?

20:51.709 --> 20:53.586
Bobbi: I broke up with Craig
last night.
Trudy: Yes.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.838
I feel like this huge weight
is lifted off my shoulder.

20:55.838 --> 20:59.008
Best feeling ever.
Robert: What's the best feeling
ever?

20:59.008 --> 21:01.802
Bobbi: Nothing Robert.
Anyway, I'm gonna fill you in
all about it later. Ok?

21:01.802 --> 21:02.887
Trudy: Okay.
Robert: On what?

21:02.887 --> 21:05.973
Bobbi: Nothing, nothing. Ok?

21:08.726 --> 21:11.520
Robert: Secrets
between girls, huh?

21:16.150 --> 21:19.278
Trudy, I said I was sorry and
that it was an accident ok?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.239
I'm sorry you hurt
your back.

21:25.534 --> 21:30.915
Trudy [laughing]: Sucker!

21:30.915 --> 21:33.960
Ow, oh my back.
Do you know what?

21:33.960 --> 21:38.881
You hurt me so bad, I can't do
this and I can't do that either.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.841
Do you know what I'll
never be able to do again?

21:42.218 --> 21:44.720
Best six hours
I ever spent.

21:44.720 --> 21:49.850
[Laughing] Oh God, oh yeah,
that was worth it.
