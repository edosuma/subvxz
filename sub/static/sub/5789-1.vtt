52:52.720 --> 52:56.167
The priest will assist.
You must stay here.

52:56.920 --> 53:00.500
You're the only one who knows the system,
the only one to protect the Archives.

53:00.600 --> 53:04.082
The only one to carry on
if I don't return.

53:19.440 --> 53:21.124
ROGER:
This is the only thing we have left.

53:23.120 --> 53:25.820
- An exorcism?
- Yeah.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.081
Are you out of your mind?

53:42.080 --> 53:43.809
Here it is. (SIGHS)

53:47.600 --> 53:48.647
BRUUN: How do you feel?

53:52.480 --> 53:54.130
I'm ready for this.

53:56.280 --> 53:58.442
No one is ready for the truth.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.243
What's with the big production?

54:16.480 --> 54:19.086
It helps preserve the integrity
of the church to

54:19.800 --> 54:21.962
disprove possessions for what they are.

54:22.960 --> 54:25.691
Usually some form of mental illness.

54:27.960 --> 54:30.167
You are skeptical about this?

54:31.720 --> 54:32.721
(SCOFFS)

54:33.120 --> 54:34.565
You can say that.

54:38.480 --> 54:40.005
Can you plug this in?

54:53.400 --> 54:57.041
When I was 12 years old,
I was possessed by a demon.

55:00.320 --> 55:02.163
For six days,

55:02.560 --> 55:04.860
the priest battled the demon
inside of me,

55:04.960 --> 55:08.780
steadfast in his belief
that you can kill the evil spirit

55:08.880 --> 55:11.167
and preserve the body.

55:11.920 --> 55:12.921
Uh.

55:13.400 --> 55:14.481
And how did he do?

55:18.960 --> 55:20.564
I want to see the room.

55:24.640 --> 55:26.165
Why are you putting that up there?

55:27.360 --> 55:29.601
I don't want it to be in the way.

55:32.240 --> 55:33.366
So,

55:34.640 --> 55:36.927
what can you tell me about Angela?

55:42.320 --> 55:43.845
Angela's

55:45.560 --> 55:46.721
perfect.

55:48.080 --> 55:51.721
I've never heard her say
an unkind word about anyone, ever.

55:53.400 --> 55:54.401
Mmm.

55:55.400 --> 56:00.122
You see, demons can be
very shrewd and calculating.

56:01.360 --> 56:07.925
They hide in the image of their host.
They lie and deceive using the truth.

56:08.840 --> 56:11.020
We need to know Angela

56:11.120 --> 56:13.805
so that we know what she is not.

56:22.640 --> 56:26.020
Can you please give us a moment
before we begin?

56:26.120 --> 56:28.168
Perhaps you can go check on Angela.

56:28.280 --> 56:29.725
Oh, yeah, sure.

56:34.720 --> 56:36.580
Prepare the Eucharist.

56:36.680 --> 56:41.060
If she accepts the Body of Christ,
a demon does not exist.

56:41.160 --> 56:43.128
- But she's possessed.
- She is.

56:44.160 --> 56:46.845
But we will see
what we are dealing with.

56:51.440 --> 56:53.780
- Heavenly Father...
- No.

56:53.880 --> 56:55.041
No?

56:55.760 --> 56:57.380
Just prepare the Eucharist.

56:57.480 --> 57:00.060
But the mass is essential
in preparing the Eucharist.

57:00.160 --> 57:01.525
No mass.

57:03.120 --> 57:06.980
Sometimes,
in search of what is an abomination,

57:07.080 --> 57:08.809
we move away from God.

57:10.120 --> 57:14.091
So do as I instruct tonight.
Trust what I do.

57:14.640 --> 57:17.962
Because a demon's greatest threat
is not to your body,

57:19.200 --> 57:20.804
but your soul.

57:27.640 --> 57:28.641
(CAMERA BEEPS)

57:30.320 --> 57:31.651
Bring her in.

57:43.680 --> 57:44.841
It's okay.

57:45.720 --> 57:47.688
This is Cardinal Bruun.

57:48.520 --> 57:51.091
He's going to help you, sweetie.

57:51.560 --> 57:53.005
Have her kneel.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.201
Come on.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.684
Facing this way, please.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.684

Please, Angela, sit down on the bed.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.649
This will be much easier
if you sit down on the bed.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.086
Hey.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.609
It's okay. I got you.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.330
It's okay.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.690
Now, will you allow me

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.203
to remove the obstruction?

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.370
Don't. Don't.

(SOBBING)

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.763
(CRYING) Father, do something.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.442
Do something!

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.890
(GASPING)

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.640
What did you do?

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.330
LOZANO: Roger, no, no, no, no!

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.340
Roger, Roger, stop!

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.180
He killed my daughter.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.420
Roger, Roger, Roger,
take a look at the signs.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.100
Her 40 days in the coma,
Christ's 40 days of temptation in the desert.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.690
Her mother was a prostitute.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.460
- A perversion of the Virgin Mary.
- No.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.300
- The black raven mocks the white dove.
- No. No!

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.780
- Roger, Roger, Angela's gone. She's gone.
- No, no.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.300
- She's gone!
- She's not gone!

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.890
LOZANO: Roger! Roger!

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:17.721

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.726
ROGER: Oh, my God.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.730
ROGER: Stigmata.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.330
It's the resurrection.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.169
BRUUN: Omega, Alpha.

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.490
Our ending, its beginning.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.170
It's the Antichrist.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.404
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.241

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.220
Though I walk

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.482
through the valley
of the shadows of death,

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.210
I will show no fear

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.260
for thou art with me.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.124
PETE: Ange, what are you doing?

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.100

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.681
(SCREAMS)

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.731
I'm not afraid of you.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.960
You tell them I am here.

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.043
You tell them I walk the earth.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.820
(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.921
(GROANS)

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.282
- LOZANO: Here it is.
- IMANI: Thank you for keeping the tape secret.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.124
You have witnessed
the rising of the Antichrist.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.205
That's what she wanted.

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.969
You are the only one
who has faced the ending and survived.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.642
There's a reason for that.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.130
You're one of us now, a warrior of God.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.251
There's something I must show you.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.529
(KEYS CLACKING)

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.770
Come and see.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.684
LOZANO: What is this place?

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.529
IMANI: These are the Archives,

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.929
where we keep the records
of the devil's work on earth.

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.246
Follow me.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.380
IMANI: Much has happened
during your recovery.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:53.060
MAN ON TV: Local officials remain unclear
on the cause of the explosion.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.324
The victims have been identified
as US Army Colonel Roger Holmes,

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.300
26-year-old Peter Smith,

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.420
and Mattias Bruun,
a Cardinal residing at the Vatican.

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.540
A representative said that Bruun's visit
was not connected to Church affairs

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.723
and that he was in the US
on a personal vacation.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.780
MAN ON TV: One of the survivors,
Father Oscar Lozano

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.300
from the Los Angeles Archdiocese

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.420
currently is recovering at
Saint Mary's Hospital from multiple injuries.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.300
Another survivor, Angela Holmes,

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.220
was seen by a neighbor emerging
from the rubble without a scratch.

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:26.780
Miss Holmes reportedly has no memory
of the events leading up to the blast.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.325
And then

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.260
it began.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:35.763
Unbelievable event taking place
at the 6th Street homeless shelter.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.380
MAN ON TV: Multiple miracles
have been reported

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.140
from the curing of a young girl
with leukemia

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.340
to restoring the sight of a man
who lost his sight in an industrial accident.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.340
MAN ON TV: Hundreds of people
have gathered outside this shelter

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.500
in hopes that they, too, can be healed.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:54.161
At that moment,
I could feel my legs again.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.620
This isn't an isolated incident.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:02.380
This is hundreds of people documented,
restored to health.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:07.771
There is no medical
explanation for this.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.020
So, what is it?

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.860
Where does this power come from?

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.962
Is it divine?

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.086
I don't know.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.324
I just want to help
as many people as I can.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.900
MAN ON TV: This only adds to the storm
of controversy surrounding Angela Holmes,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.820
who, in two short months, has inspired
an ever-growing legion of faithful followers.

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.780
Some are calling her a saint,
others a charlatan.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.300
But tonight, thousands
have gathered inside this arena

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:45.167
to find out first-hand if Angela Holmes
is, indeed, a miracle worker.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.540
(KNOCKING)

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.961
MAN: Miss Holmes? It's time.

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.691
BRUUN: The Book of Revelation says,

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.340
one will come to mimic the Christ

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.887
and the deceived will worship
this false prophet.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.900
And that is the day we most fear.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.570
