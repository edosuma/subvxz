WEBVTT

00:04.631 --> 00:05.674
<i>Dinner.</i>

00:05.757 --> 00:07.717
<i>Fast approaching, yes.
And we'll eat it, I'm sure.</i>

00:07.801 --> 00:08.885
<i>Yeah, no, no, no.</i>

00:08.968 --> 00:10.053
But me and you,

00:10.136 --> 00:12.013
maybe we could eat somewhere else.

00:12.097 --> 00:14.557
Somewhere nice.

00:15.892 --> 00:16.976
Oh.

00:20.522 --> 00:21.773
Good.

00:21.856 --> 00:24.192
Uh... Well, you should come find me
when you're finished here,

00:24.275 --> 00:28.488
and I'll start working on options
to run by you for that.

00:38.748 --> 00:39.833
Ugh!

00:39.916 --> 00:41.209
What idiot... Oh!

01:00.770 --> 01:01.813
No.

01:01.896 --> 01:02.939
Fitz!

01:03.022 --> 01:04.190
Fitz!

01:05.066 --> 01:06.276
Help!

01:06.359 --> 01:08.153
Help! No!

01:08.236 --> 01:09.404
No.

01:18.747 --> 01:20.373
Where the hell am I?

01:36.681 --> 01:37.974
No...

01:39.851 --> 01:42.103
It's not possible.

01:45.857 --> 01:47.734
Everything will be fine.

01:47.817 --> 01:49.027
Proper protocol
for agents lost in the field,

01:49.110 --> 01:51.362
remain in position, wait for extraction.

01:53.031 --> 01:54.240
This is Dr Jemma Simmons,

01:54.324 --> 01:56.951
updating the file on the Monolith
Fitz and I have been studying.

01:57.035 --> 01:58.203
I now know

01:58.286 --> 02:00.997
that it is an alternating-matter
transportation device.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.957
A portal. Quite remarkable, really.

02:03.041 --> 02:05.502
I've been transported
to an unknown planet,

02:06.211 --> 02:08.003
in a different solar system.

02:09.506 --> 02:12.842
Air is breathable, oxygenated.

02:15.678 --> 02:19.182
Gravity seems to be slightly stronger.

02:19.265 --> 02:21.059
Or I'm very tired.

02:23.728 --> 02:25.688
I think it's the gravity.

02:27.106 --> 02:32.070
The terrain is barren, desert-like.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.781
Although conditions seem favourable
for terrestrial organisms,

02:34.864 --> 02:38.910
there's no immediate sign of life,
nor any noticeable vegetation or water.

02:45.917 --> 02:49.212
It will open again. Fitz will find a way.

02:49.879 --> 02:51.840
After all, we're going for dinner.

02:59.264 --> 03:01.099
What is it you always say?

03:01.182 --> 03:04.644
"If you can't solve a problem,
sleep on it."

03:13.611 --> 03:16.155
Good night, Fitz.

03:23.371 --> 03:26.332
How long are the nights on this planet?

03:34.299 --> 03:37.260
There has to be a sunrise eventually.

03:44.726 --> 03:47.020
Where is the sun?

03:47.103 --> 03:50.732
What did you do to it? I want the sun!

03:53.109 --> 03:55.069
I want...

04:03.202 --> 04:05.788
I want to go home.

04:12.045 --> 04:14.505
<i>The average person can survive
up to three weeks without food,</i>

04:15.089 --> 04:18.259
<i>but only 100 hours without water.</i>

04:19.177 --> 04:22.972
I'm sorry, Fitz.
I can't wait here any longer.

04:25.266 --> 04:29.312
But if you do show up while I'm away,
you'll know where to find me.

04:37.570 --> 04:40.949
Is it going to be an expensive place?
Have you already picked it?

04:41.032 --> 04:43.409
Should I wear a dress,
or would that be weird?

04:43.493 --> 04:45.495
Oh, please don't pull out
the chair for me.

04:47.163 --> 04:50.208
Or do, if that's what you want.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.592
What if we run out
of things to talk about?

04:59.676 --> 05:01.135
For the first time ever.

05:01.219 --> 05:03.721
Of course that's when it would happen.
Ugh. That would be terrible.

05:17.443 --> 05:22.031
Just get to the top.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.701
Water...

05:58.234 --> 06:00.278
Fitz.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.446
Oh, Fitz.

06:22.300 --> 06:23.468
Mmm.

06:24.969 --> 06:26.054
Oh.

07:20.733 --> 07:21.901
Ugh.

07:35.373 --> 07:37.041
It's been three weeks, Fitz.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.794
If I don't find something,

07:39.877 --> 07:43.381
if I don't eat, I won't make it.

07:45.049 --> 07:47.385
<i>Unfortunately, the only source of food</i>

07:50.054 --> 07:52.974
<i>also thinks I'm food.</i>

07:53.057 --> 07:55.726
You want me? Here I am!

07:55.810 --> 07:58.563
It's dinnertime! Come and get it.

08:19.917 --> 08:23.129
You're dinner, biatch!
Whoo!

08:58.789 --> 09:01.834
You'd be so proud of me, Fitz.
I killed the monster plant,

09:01.959 --> 09:04.045
then I made a fire,
cooked him and ate him.

09:04.128 --> 09:06.130
And then I burped really loud.

09:06.214 --> 09:08.132
I wish you could've been here.

09:09.884 --> 09:12.011
Actually, no, I don't.

09:12.637 --> 09:14.805
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

09:19.894 --> 09:23.606
Everyone always said
we could read each other's minds, Fitz,

09:23.689 --> 09:26.484
so I really need you
to read mine right now.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.985
I'm alive,

09:29.904 --> 09:31.906
but I'm terribly alone and afraid.

09:33.157 --> 09:36.035
So I really need you
to come and get me, okay?

09:38.162 --> 09:41.832
I know you won't give up,
so I won't either.

09:52.051 --> 09:55.263
You'll notice I'm giving less updates
to conserve battery power.

09:55.346 --> 09:57.556
Been on this stupid planet
for a month now,

09:57.682 --> 09:59.684
and I lost my way to the entry point.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.769
I need to find the...

11:01.412 --> 11:03.581
Who are you? What do you want?

11:22.641 --> 11:23.809
It's still here.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.603
Of course I'm still here.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.773
Let me out of here!

11:31.108 --> 11:33.319
Let me out of here, now!

11:54.507 --> 11:56.342
Welcome back. How was your day?

12:02.932 --> 12:05.810
My name is Jemma Simmons.
Dr Jemma Simmons.

12:05.935 --> 12:07.937
I'm from Earth,
and I came here through a portal.

12:08.020 --> 12:11.440
And since you speak English,
I suspect you might have as well.

12:18.864 --> 12:22.284
If you let me out, I can help you.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.954
We can help each other.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.334
You going to eat me?
Is that what this is all about?

12:30.459 --> 12:32.837
You fatten me up
and then lead me to the slaughter?

12:35.965 --> 12:37.550
Not a bad idea.

12:52.523 --> 12:55.192
You poisoned me.
Why would you do that?

12:55.317 --> 12:58.028
What threat could I possibly be to you?

13:07.580 --> 13:08.706
Definitely real.

13:11.375 --> 13:12.877
Get back here!

13:40.779 --> 13:43.908
Kill me, if you want,
but I'm not going to be your prisoner.

13:46.702 --> 13:47.995
You're bleeding.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.121
What do you care?

13:50.414 --> 13:51.790
It smells blood.

13:51.916 --> 13:53.375
Get away from me! Don't touch me!

13:57.922 --> 13:58.964
It's coming.

13:59.924 --> 14:00.925
We have to go.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.134
- We have to go now.
- No!

14:02.635 --> 14:03.761
We have to go!

14:03.886 --> 14:06.222
Stop pulling me.

14:06.305 --> 14:08.265
I'm not going with you!

14:13.771 --> 14:14.772
Move!

14:22.988 --> 14:24.281
What do you think is out there?

14:27.451 --> 14:28.452
Death.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.206
The only thing out there is a sandstorm.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.708
It's a desert planet,
in case you hadn't noticed.

14:34.792 --> 14:37.086
It affects the planet.
That's how you know it's coming.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.713
Or the planet affects it.

14:39.797 --> 14:44.260
Either way, it's evil.
This whole godforsaken planet is evil.

14:44.343 --> 14:46.220
Planets cannot be evil.

14:46.303 --> 14:49.014
Everything that happened was
a natural climate-related phenomenon.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.725
Planets have ecosystems
with definable patterns and rules

14:51.809 --> 14:53.185
that can be understood after enough...

14:53.310 --> 14:57.606
This planet does not have rules.
It has moods.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.692
Perhaps it's you who has moods.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.203
I'm gonna have to sew that up.

15:12.663 --> 15:14.540
And maybe your mouth, too,
while I'm at it.

15:14.665 --> 15:17.626
I'm perfectly capable
of tending to my own wounds.

15:24.675 --> 15:26.176
Why would I trust you anyway?

15:26.302 --> 15:29.513
You locked me in a cage,
stabbed me with a spear,

15:30.556 --> 15:32.266
threatened to eat me.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.601
That was your idea.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.394
Besides, that's before
I knew you were real,

15:35.519 --> 15:37.813
if the evil hadn't gotten to you or to me.

15:39.023 --> 15:41.066
Next time you have doubts
about whether someone is real,

15:41.859 --> 15:43.527
ask them to hit you.

15:44.028 --> 15:45.195
I'll keep that in mind.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.410
Do you have a name?

15:52.703 --> 15:53.746
Will.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.709
You wouldn't happen to have
any alcohol, would you, Will?

15:58.834 --> 16:01.503
Yeah, I'll run down to the drugstore
and get it for you.

16:01.587 --> 16:03.505
Would you, please,
if it's not too much trouble?

16:21.398 --> 16:22.483
You're a doctor?

16:22.566 --> 16:24.818
Not a medical doctor, but yes.

16:24.902 --> 16:27.071
I have PhDs in biology and chemistry.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.241
But I have more than my fair share
of emergency work in the field.

16:32.451 --> 16:34.411
- You?
- Not very science-y.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.081
Hmm.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.416
You certainly came here prepared.

16:39.500 --> 16:43.170
Wish I'd had time to pack,
but my trip was rather unexpected.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.172
You come here alone?

16:45.255 --> 16:47.049
Yes, I'm alone.

16:48.425 --> 16:49.510
Are you?

16:49.593 --> 16:52.096
You're the first person
I've seen in a long time.

16:52.221 --> 16:54.264
- How long have you been here?
- I don't know.

16:54.348 --> 16:55.599
My watch broke quickly,

16:55.683 --> 16:58.268
and it's hard to keep
track of the days without a sun.

17:01.355 --> 17:02.731
What year is it?

17:03.190 --> 17:04.358
2015.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.873
You're an astronaut.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.088
Well, if NASA sent you, they must know
how to bring you back, right?

17:29.800 --> 17:33.137
This equipment is ancient.
I know NASA has funding issues,

17:33.262 --> 17:35.723
but you'd think
they'd upgrade for a mission like this.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.558
It was new at the time.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.477
What year did you come here?

17:40.561 --> 17:41.979
2001.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.981
My God.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.109
You've been here 14 years.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.655
Like I said.

17:51.780 --> 17:54.074
It's hard to keep track.

17:54.158 --> 17:55.659
You'll see.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.919
Technology must've
hit warp speed after I left.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.504
Yeah, it's hard to keep up sometimes.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.173
If it wasn't for Fitz, I'd be lost.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.257
Fitz?

18:10.340 --> 18:12.968
My best friend. He loves tech.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.345
Is this a map of the area?

18:15.471 --> 18:17.848
Only the areas we were able to explore.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.516
What's this, the "No Fly Zone"?

18:19.600 --> 18:21.018
Off-limits.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.603
Only bad things happen there.

18:22.686 --> 18:23.937
How much memory
you have in this thing?

18:24.021 --> 18:25.522
120 gigabytes.

18:25.606 --> 18:26.857
Hundred...

18:27.858 --> 18:30.819
120 gigabytes in this little thing?

18:33.197 --> 18:35.324
Fourteen years.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.452
I'm sorry,
but I need to conserve the battery.

18:38.535 --> 18:41.789
Fitz engineered it to last a long time,
but it's draining.

18:41.872 --> 18:44.291
So unless you have some way
to generate power...

18:44.374 --> 18:47.795
NASA sent us here
with all the power we could ever use.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.798
Except it's all solar.

18:50.881 --> 18:55.677
And in case you haven't noticed,
there's not much sunshine.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.889
Where's this light coming from?

18:58.972 --> 19:01.809
There's a luminescent
substrata below us.

19:01.892 --> 19:04.311
Huh. It's warm.

19:04.394 --> 19:08.357
It's a natural source of heat,
keeps the planet warm without sunlight.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.151
That sounds very science-y of you.

19:11.235 --> 19:13.320
I think it's the Fires of Hell.

19:13.403 --> 19:14.905
Okay, then.

19:15.572 --> 19:16.740
Hey, you hungry?

19:18.867 --> 19:20.744
You said your whole team
came through the portal.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.246
How long were you
supposed to be here?

19:22.329 --> 19:24.915
They said they could
have us back within a year.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.502
But there was always a possibility
it would be a one-way trip.

19:29.503 --> 19:31.505
NASA was always
curious about the Monolith.

19:31.588 --> 19:34.091
Budgets for space exploration
had vanished,

19:34.216 --> 19:37.177
so some small group on the inside
convinced everyone

19:37.261 --> 19:40.931
it was the affordable future
of space exploration.

19:42.933 --> 19:46.770
If you're not with NASA,
how did you get into the Monolith?

19:46.854 --> 19:49.857
It's not with NASA any more.
It's with S.H.I.E.L.D.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.860
They've had it for quite some time.
I'm not sure how or why.

19:52.943 --> 19:54.444
That's real? S.H.I.E.L.D.?

19:54.570 --> 19:57.114
It was. I was recruited
right out of the academy.

19:57.573 --> 20:00.868
I was a test pilot for the Air Force,
recruited by NASA.

20:00.951 --> 20:02.035
Now here I am.

20:02.119 --> 20:04.371
Here we are. At least you volunteered.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.873
Yeah.

20:05.956 --> 20:09.293
I've never been able
to resist doing something

20:09.418 --> 20:11.211
when I'm told the odds are impossible.

20:11.295 --> 20:15.549
When NASA wanted volunteers,
I was first in line.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.468
<i>And the first one through the portal.</i>

20:19.136 --> 20:20.554
<i>Me and all the gear.</i>

20:21.638 --> 20:25.058
<i>The other three were right behind me.
They were all scientists.</i>

20:25.142 --> 20:26.560
<i>How did NASA know
there would be</i>

20:26.643 --> 20:27.978
<i>an hospitable planet on the other side?</i>

20:28.103 --> 20:29.479
<i>Classified, above my paygrade.</i>

20:30.898 --> 20:35.819
<i>Our job was to collect samples,
map the terrain, study the stars.</i>

20:37.321 --> 20:40.657
<i>My job was to keep my head
if things went sideways.</i>

20:41.825 --> 20:45.078
Keep everyone alive
till they find a way to bring us back.

20:46.121 --> 20:47.331
What happened to the others?

20:48.332 --> 20:49.333
It.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.835
It has this way

20:51.960 --> 20:56.924
of getting inside your head
and just making you crazy.

20:57.799 --> 21:00.594
Austin threw himself off a cliff.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.512
Brubaker

21:03.513 --> 21:06.308
set himself on fire.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.938
<i>Taylor took an axe to the gear,</i>

21:12.356 --> 21:13.607
<i>and then he came after me.</i>

21:14.608 --> 21:18.362
<i>I had one job,</i>

21:19.321 --> 21:21.490
<i>keep them alive.</i>

21:25.535 --> 21:27.996
<i>How did you survive?</i>

21:28.205 --> 21:31.291
Oh. Just managed to avoid it.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.293
Occasionally outsmart it.

21:33.377 --> 21:34.544
Mostly,

21:35.379 --> 21:36.463
just luck.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.215
And if there is no "it"?

21:38.298 --> 21:40.217
You still think I'm making all this up?

21:41.301 --> 21:43.387
It's just that there's also
a psychological reason

21:43.512 --> 21:44.721
for what happened to them.

21:44.805 --> 21:46.723
Maybe they went mad
from extreme isolation.

21:46.848 --> 21:48.392
- It's not uncommon.
- It is for astronauts.

21:48.517 --> 21:50.560
We're trained for years of isolation.

21:50.978 --> 21:52.479
Well, if they didn't go mad...

21:52.562 --> 21:55.065
Well, then I must have gone mad.

21:58.235 --> 22:01.571
Maybe I went crazy,
and maybe I killed everyone.

22:01.697 --> 22:02.739
I... I didn't...

22:02.823 --> 22:06.076
You have no idea
what the hell's going on here.

22:25.554 --> 22:28.098
I didn't mean to imply...

22:31.059 --> 22:32.352
Perhaps it's best if we start over,

22:32.436 --> 22:33.937
since we're
going to be working together.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.439
Working together?

22:35.564 --> 22:37.190
- On what?
- On getting home.

22:37.274 --> 22:39.609
There's no getting home.
The sooner you accept that, the better.

22:39.735 --> 22:41.111
Survival is all that matters.

22:41.194 --> 22:44.197
I will not accept that.
There's always hope.

22:44.281 --> 22:45.907
Not on this planet.

22:48.452 --> 22:50.203
Then that's how we'll work together.

22:50.287 --> 22:51.788
I'll be the voice of hope,
you be the voice of doom.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.457
We'll keep each other in check.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.042
Deal?

22:58.462 --> 23:01.298
See, it's working already.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.633
No, it's not.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.137
Ice-cold beer.

23:07.596 --> 23:09.806
Truffle fries.

23:09.890 --> 23:10.974
Steak, medium rare,

23:11.099 --> 23:12.976
- and another ice-cold beer.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:13.477 --> 23:16.146
Wine. Ugh. I'd kill for a glass of wine.

23:18.315 --> 23:19.733
What do you miss that's not food?

23:19.816 --> 23:23.320
Oh, the sun. Without a doubt. You?

23:27.324 --> 23:29.076
<i>Okay, Jemma,
get ready to make a wish,</i>

23:29.159 --> 23:30.994
<i>and we will blow out
the candle for you.</i>

23:31.119 --> 23:32.788
<i>Happy birthday, Jemma!</i>

23:33.830 --> 23:36.583
<i>Happy birthday, Jemma.
It's not the same without you here.</i>

23:36.666 --> 23:38.251
<i>Say hi to your parents for me,
and I'll see you soon.</i>

23:38.335 --> 23:39.503
That's Fitz.

23:44.007 --> 23:45.258
That's Fitz, there.

23:45.342 --> 23:47.177
I figured.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.512
You talk about him a lot.

23:49.012 --> 23:51.348
- His name is like your favourite word.
- Yeah.

23:51.431 --> 23:55.102
I mean, that's a little bit more
than a best friend.

23:55.310 --> 23:56.478
Oh.

23:56.978 --> 23:59.189
We're inseparable.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.483
Or we were.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.195
Anyone in your life?

24:05.987 --> 24:08.698
I always thought
there'd be time for that later.

24:14.204 --> 24:17.040
I think I'm going to
turn in for the night.

24:17.124 --> 24:19.209
Thanks for dinner.

24:25.674 --> 24:27.843
Good night, Fitz.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.154
Good night, Will.

24:55.412 --> 24:56.746
Damn it, Fitz! What are we missing?

24:56.872 --> 24:58.665
If there's a way in,
there has to be a way out.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.667
- Everything okay?
- No, it's not okay.

25:00.750 --> 25:03.003
I've been going over and over
this research for over two months,

25:03.086 --> 25:04.588
and I'm still no closer to an answer.

25:04.713 --> 25:06.840
Well, why don't we go outside,
go for a little walk?

25:06.923 --> 25:08.592
I want to go to the No Fly Zone.

25:08.717 --> 25:10.010
We've been over this a hundred times.

25:10.093 --> 25:11.761
You're not going out there.
That's a bad place.

25:11.887 --> 25:14.347
The answer might be there.
I'm tired of sitting around and waiting.

25:14.431 --> 25:16.349
Nothing is out there except for death!

25:16.433 --> 25:18.351
I told you.
That's where they all went right before...

25:18.435 --> 25:19.686
It's a coincidence.

25:22.898 --> 25:24.107
There could be something there.

25:24.191 --> 25:25.734
You are not going.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.445
We made a deal
to keep each other in check.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.947
"In check" doesn't mean you get
to keep me as your prisoner.

25:31.948 --> 25:34.576
- Where are you going?
- Obviously, nowhere.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.544
He means well, Jemma.

25:48.215 --> 25:49.966
You should make him dinner tonight.

25:50.050 --> 25:52.969
Yes, that seems like a good idea.

25:53.637 --> 25:56.306
Then you should
stop talking to yourself.

26:30.757 --> 26:35.011
The stars. Fitz, that's the answer.

27:28.064 --> 27:29.858
Open the door!

27:33.320 --> 27:35.238
It's coming!

27:43.913 --> 27:46.082
You were right, Will. I saw it.

27:46.207 --> 27:49.002
Whatever it is...
Something was out there.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.337
Where'd you see it? Where were you?

27:50.420 --> 27:52.922
Out by some junkyard.
We weren't the first ones here.

27:53.048 --> 27:54.841
- It was a mass grave.
- Jemma, that's near the No Fly Zone.

27:54.924 --> 27:57.010
I told you never to go there.
You could've been killed.

27:57.093 --> 27:59.346
- Or worse.
- You knew about that place?

28:00.430 --> 28:03.683
All those bones, proof of others,
and you didn't tell me?

28:03.767 --> 28:04.851
Yes.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.271
Because I knew you'd want to see it.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.357
And it's better that you didn't.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.692
That thing

28:12.776 --> 28:15.945
has been killing everyone
that's come through here for centuries.

28:16.029 --> 28:17.697
How long have people
known about the Monolith?

28:17.781 --> 28:20.367
And why keep sending people
when there's no way back?

28:20.450 --> 28:22.035
It's as if they're being sacrificed.

28:22.118 --> 28:23.953
I'd prefer not to join them.

28:24.037 --> 28:26.456
So, from now on,
will you just please stay put?

28:26.581 --> 28:28.208
That doesn't matter any more.

28:28.291 --> 28:29.751
Why?

28:30.919 --> 28:32.712
Because I know how to get us home.

28:35.799 --> 28:38.968
This is where you came in,
this is where I came in.

28:39.052 --> 28:40.887
All right, Professor. I'm listening.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.555
The Monolith creates a wormhole,

28:42.639 --> 28:45.809
a direct line from its location on Earth
to a fixed location here.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.060
You just said the portal is moving.

28:47.143 --> 28:49.562
It appears to be moving,
but it's the planet that's moving,

28:49.646 --> 28:52.565
rotating on its axis. The portal is fixed.

28:52.649 --> 28:55.235
Since we know the date, time
and place we both arrived,

28:55.318 --> 28:57.737
we know how long it took
to move from X to Y.

28:57.821 --> 28:59.697
If we track the stars long enough,

28:59.823 --> 29:01.991
we can determine
the rate of the planet's rotation

29:02.117 --> 29:04.661
and predict when and where
the portal will appear.

29:04.786 --> 29:05.787
With that thing?

29:05.870 --> 29:07.705
Not with this. With that.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.419
Assuming we can
even fix that heap of junk,

29:12.502 --> 29:13.628
there's no way to power it.

29:13.711 --> 29:15.004
Yes, there is.

29:16.631 --> 29:19.134
I have enough battery left
to get the data we need.

29:19.843 --> 29:23.430
If we use up your battery
and this doesn't work,

29:23.513 --> 29:27.142
that's the end of Fitz
and all your friends.

29:33.690 --> 29:36.192
<i>Happy birthday, Jemma!</i>

29:36.317 --> 29:38.611
<i>Happy birthday, Jemma.
It's not the same without you here.</i>

29:38.695 --> 29:41.698
<i>Say hi to your parents for me,
and I'll see you soon.</i>

29:44.033 --> 29:47.996
Goodbye, Fitz. I'll see you soon.

30:46.596 --> 30:48.348
- What happened?
- It died.

30:48.431 --> 30:49.682
But it's in a better place now.

30:49.766 --> 30:51.851
- You get anything?
- We got one.

30:51.935 --> 30:55.063
There. Eighteen days from now.

30:55.772 --> 30:56.940
Why did it have to be there?

30:57.482 --> 31:01.027
It's the No Fly Zone.
It's a 40-hour hike, at least.

31:01.110 --> 31:05.156
There's a canyon, 30 metres wide,
waiting for us.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.951
It's impossible to cross, Jemma.
We'll never make it.

31:08.076 --> 31:09.827
Didn't you say you can't resist
doing something

31:09.953 --> 31:12.288
when the odds are impossible?

31:13.456 --> 31:15.333
I knew that snake would
come back to bite me.

31:15.458 --> 31:18.294
Got two weeks, fly boy. Figure it out.

31:21.673 --> 31:24.884
So, question, Professor.
Why science?

31:24.968 --> 31:27.262
How'd you figure all this out?
The planets, the math.

31:27.345 --> 31:28.763
Scoliosis.

31:28.846 --> 31:29.889
Okay.

31:29.973 --> 31:33.518
I had scoliosis as a kid.
A small surgery to correct it.

31:33.643 --> 31:36.771
I was flat on my back for a few weeks
so to help combat the boredom,

31:36.854 --> 31:40.567
every night my father would wheel
my bed out and talk about the stars.

31:40.650 --> 31:42.402
Nice job, Dad.

31:42.485 --> 31:45.989
So, this portal, how do we know it's
not just a door that swings one way?

31:46.114 --> 31:47.657
I think it acts more like a valve.

31:47.782 --> 31:49.325
On Earth, it seemed to open randomly,

31:49.450 --> 31:51.244
but it only appeared random
from our point of view.

31:51.327 --> 31:52.412
And what opens it?

31:52.495 --> 31:53.955
The moons.

31:54.038 --> 31:55.873
Their degree of alignment
affects the portal

31:55.999 --> 31:58.251
the way our moon affects the tide,

31:58.334 --> 32:01.170
causing it to ebb and flow,
pulling things in and out.

32:01.296 --> 32:03.047
So the portal opens,

32:03.172 --> 32:04.841
we just jump right through,
go with the flow?

32:04.966 --> 32:06.467
Well, it doesn't stay open very long.

32:06.551 --> 32:09.012
So, in case there's no time for that...

32:10.138 --> 32:11.723
We send a message in a bottle.

32:11.848 --> 32:13.516
Everything Fitz needs to know
to open it,

32:13.641 --> 32:14.892
keep it open, and come and get us.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.270
I'm glad that thing sent you over here
and not the janitor.

32:17.353 --> 32:18.521
Thanks.

32:21.149 --> 32:23.985
How exactly is this supposed to
get us across the canyon?

32:24.068 --> 32:26.487
We only have one shot,
and we have to leave tomorrow.

32:27.030 --> 32:28.531
Well...

32:29.532 --> 32:31.909
I'm going to shoot this into the wall
across the canyon.

32:32.035 --> 32:33.995
We're going to slide across on the rope.

32:36.873 --> 32:38.541
What, you think
I was going to build a helicopter?

32:38.666 --> 32:40.209
Kind of.

32:40.335 --> 32:42.670
- You think it's going to work?
- It'll work.

32:43.588 --> 32:45.214
You still want to do this?

32:46.215 --> 32:48.051
We don't have a choice.

33:04.609 --> 33:06.069
Eat, shower, or sleep?

33:06.194 --> 33:07.987
What are you going to do first
when we get back?

33:08.071 --> 33:11.366
Eat. Please, who are you talking to?
What are you gonna do?

33:11.449 --> 33:14.285
I'm going to eat in the shower
and fall asleep while doing it.

33:14.410 --> 33:17.413
That's very efficient,
I expect nothing less.

33:26.547 --> 33:28.925
The geologist that came with us
had this theory

33:29.050 --> 33:33.012
that this planet used to be a paradise,
Garden of Eden.

33:33.096 --> 33:34.972
What did
he think happened?

33:35.807 --> 33:40.353
It, Death, whatever that thing is,
consumed this world.

33:40.436 --> 33:42.897
Do you think we'll see it?

33:44.774 --> 33:46.442
I don't know.

33:47.652 --> 33:51.447
But if we do, I'll be ready.

33:52.281 --> 33:53.700
You have a gun?

33:53.783 --> 33:55.618
Only one bullet left.

33:55.743 --> 33:58.871
It was gonna be my ticket out of here,
in case things got too bad.

33:58.955 --> 34:00.623
Come on, hurry.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.386
Oh. This can't be it.

34:13.469 --> 34:14.971
We made a mistake.
We went the wrong way.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.306
- This is the spot, but...
- You said it was 30 metres wide.

34:17.431 --> 34:18.766
There's no way we can cross that.

34:18.850 --> 34:21.268
- It was, I swear.
- That's more like 100 meters.

34:21.351 --> 34:23.228
Unless there was
some significant earthquake.

34:23.312 --> 34:24.772
It doesn't want us to leave.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.110
There it is! It's opening!

34:30.110 --> 34:32.989
There has to be a way to make that.
We didn't come this far to fail.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.489
Maybe we don't have to get there.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.869
Hand me the bottle.

34:47.837 --> 34:48.880
We can fire it right into the portal.

34:49.005 --> 34:50.465
If it's not dragging any rope,
it might just make it.

34:50.547 --> 34:53.092
Hurry. We've only got one shot.

34:53.176 --> 34:54.677
Ready?

34:55.636 --> 34:56.679
Now!

35:00.057 --> 35:01.225
Come on, come on, come on.

35:05.521 --> 35:07.023
No.

35:28.002 --> 35:30.546
We're never going home.

35:35.927 --> 35:38.262
Maybe this is our home now.

35:39.222 --> 35:41.390
This isn't a home.

35:43.851 --> 35:45.770
This is hell.

35:48.898 --> 35:50.566
Hey, hey, hey.

35:53.945 --> 35:55.530
Shh.

35:56.697 --> 35:58.866
You were right.

36:02.078 --> 36:04.914
There's no hope on this planet.

36:05.915 --> 36:08.251
That's what I used to think.

36:14.757 --> 36:16.634
Then you showed up.

36:33.276 --> 36:34.944
Jemma, you ready?

36:35.069 --> 36:37.238
Relax. We're not going to miss it.

36:37.321 --> 36:39.907
I'm the one
who did the math, remember?

36:49.959 --> 36:52.879
Even if we do miss it,
there'll be another one in 18 years.

36:52.962 --> 36:55.006
Not funny.

37:01.512 --> 37:03.764
Pretty good spot for a sunrise, huh?

37:05.266 --> 37:06.475
It is.

37:08.185 --> 37:09.312
Think I'll get a tan?

37:09.979 --> 37:11.314
Well, it's only going to last
a few minutes.

37:11.439 --> 37:13.649
We're on one of the poles.

37:16.152 --> 37:17.236
Look what I found.

37:17.320 --> 37:18.654
Will, where did you...

37:18.779 --> 37:21.699
Is that the wine from the graveyard?
You went back for it.

37:29.123 --> 37:30.416
I can't vouch for the year,

37:30.499 --> 37:33.461
but I do know it pairs well
with roots and moss.

37:49.852 --> 37:51.395
To the sun.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.230
It's about time.

37:59.111 --> 38:01.822
Oh, my God, that's horrible!

38:01.906 --> 38:03.324
That is pure vinegar.

38:03.407 --> 38:06.077
It just needs to breathe.

38:08.537 --> 38:10.373
Maybe we'll use it in our cooking.

38:10.873 --> 38:12.708
Add some flavour to our lives.

38:13.709 --> 38:15.711
There's that hope again.

38:18.881 --> 38:20.800
I think my dad would've liked you.

38:23.636 --> 38:26.597
Sometimes you remind me...

38:32.603 --> 38:36.232
It's Fitz! He found a way!
We're going home!

38:42.113 --> 38:44.907
Come on! We can make it!

38:44.991 --> 38:46.659
It's just over the ridge.

38:50.997 --> 38:54.375
Jemma. Jemma, stop.
Get back here! Jemma, stop.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.836
Will, come on. What are you doing?

38:58.295 --> 39:00.673
Oh, no. Not now.

39:00.756 --> 39:03.592
- Jemma, go. You can make it.
- I'm not going without you!

39:08.848 --> 39:11.308
Will! Will!

39:19.191 --> 39:22.194
Will! They came for you!

39:22.278 --> 39:25.031
It wasn't Fitz, it's one of yours!

39:25.114 --> 39:27.658
Jemma, run!
It's not what you think it is!

39:27.783 --> 39:30.661
It's okay! We're going home.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.289
Don't trust it!

39:33.372 --> 39:35.124
It will do anything to fool you!

39:40.212 --> 39:41.881
Oh, God. It's here.

39:43.382 --> 39:44.967
It's here!

39:45.801 --> 39:47.011
- Will?
- Jemma!

39:47.136 --> 39:49.346
Jemma! Jemma, look at me.
Look at me.

39:49.472 --> 39:50.806
- Run. Run. Go!
- No!

39:50.890 --> 39:52.808
- Yes, you can make it. Go.
- No!

39:55.478 --> 39:57.813
- Will!
- Go, Jemma!

39:59.982 --> 40:01.275
Will!

40:01.358 --> 40:03.736
Will!

40:03.986 --> 40:06.363
No! Will!

40:06.489 --> 40:08.491
Jemma!

40:08.574 --> 40:10.242
Jemma, are you there?

40:10.326 --> 40:11.702
Fitz?

40:11.827 --> 40:13.037
Jemma?

40:13.162 --> 40:15.164
Fitz, can you hear me?

40:17.917 --> 40:19.001
Jemma?

40:20.503 --> 40:21.837
Jemma?

40:23.839 --> 40:25.925
Come on, Will. Come on, come on.

40:28.344 --> 40:29.762
Fitz?

40:32.056 --> 40:33.599
<i>I don't know
what happened to him.</i>

40:35.184 --> 40:36.185
Jemma!

40:37.394 --> 40:38.562
<i>If he's alive or dead.</i>

40:43.734 --> 40:46.737
But I never would've
survived without him.

40:55.204 --> 40:57.081
Talk to me, Fitz.

40:58.916 --> 41:00.584
Please.

41:09.301 --> 41:11.220
Oh, God.

41:15.558 --> 41:18.519
Please, Fitz. I need you to understand.

41:18.602 --> 41:20.312
I understand everything, Jemma.

41:20.396 --> 41:22.231
Well, then why won't you talk to me?

41:23.899 --> 41:25.526
What are you doing?

41:40.457 --> 41:43.085
We're going to get him back.
