WEBVTT

00:07.875 --> 00:10.811
[dramatic music]

00:10.878 --> 00:17.818
* *

01:41.169 --> 01:42.970
- Captain's log,
stardate...I don't know.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.306
[sighs]
Janeway thinks we're cadets.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.575
she told me to log whatever
my crew has been up to,

01:47.641 --> 01:49.510
but there's not much
to report.

01:49.577 --> 01:53.414
Since we almost flew
directly into a dying star,

01:53.481 --> 01:55.549
Janeway thought it might be
nice to teach us some basics

01:55.616 --> 01:57.351
on how to pilot
a starship.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.686
- Huh? Uh...

01:58.752 --> 02:02.156
[dramatic music]

02:02.223 --> 02:05.559
- And she taught us
the wonders of autopilot.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.860
- No! Bad Murf!

02:06.927 --> 02:08.796
You do not do that
in the bridge!

02:08.862 --> 02:12.233
- She also trained us
how to plot a course

02:12.300 --> 02:17.004
to avoid anything
that might try to hurt us...

02:17.070 --> 02:19.673
like Our Diviner,

02:19.740 --> 02:22.710
Who's probably not pleased
we took his daughter.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.145
The more distance we put
between us and Tars Lamora,

02:25.213 --> 02:26.447
the better.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.582
But big picture,
as long as our course

02:28.649 --> 02:31.785
is set to avoid any trouble,
we shouldn't have any.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.021
[chuckles] Right?

02:34.087 --> 02:35.789
[alarm blaring]

02:35.856 --> 02:37.358
- Proximity alert.
- Huh?

02:37.425 --> 02:39.527
- Janeway, enough
with the alarm.

02:39.593 --> 02:40.861
What's going on?

02:40.928 --> 02:43.163
- Has the Diviner found us?
Oh, we're dead.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.966
- I don't have any record
of a Diviner,

02:46.033 --> 02:48.001
but for the time being,
we're fine.

02:48.068 --> 02:51.339
Our sensors have discovered
this uncharted M-Class planet

02:51.405 --> 02:52.906
in the Hirogen System.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.975
We should check it out.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.978
- M-Class?
Ugh, not for my crew.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.748
We all deserve A-Class planets.

03:00.814 --> 03:04.485
- Actually, M-Class planets
are suitable for life.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.954
Readings suggest this one
is rich in some kind

03:07.020 --> 03:09.056
of cilium-like vegetation

03:09.122 --> 03:11.259
with elevated
thoron emissions,

03:11.325 --> 03:13.126
though no sentient life-forms.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.864
It's protocol for Federation
ships to explore new worlds

03:16.930 --> 03:18.999
and document their findings.

03:19.066 --> 03:22.403
And since you are cadets--

03:22.470 --> 03:24.338
- We get to go there
and explore it?

03:24.405 --> 03:28.008
- Ah, finally!
A break from you dum-dums!

03:28.075 --> 03:29.743
- Wow, wow, wow!

03:29.810 --> 03:32.646
Does this mean
we can get off the ship, Dal?

03:32.713 --> 03:36.517
- Sure, it might be nice
to stay somewhere awhile.

03:36.584 --> 03:40.454
Catch some rays,
take a cool dip.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.623
[all cheering]

03:42.690 --> 03:45.993
Oh, and let
Our Diviner catch us.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.795
No. We're not going.

03:47.861 --> 03:51.031
And there's nothing any of you
can say to talk me into it.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.533
- Then I will be forced

03:52.600 --> 03:56.103
to report your noncompliance
to Starfleet.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.671
- Know what? Good point.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.441
No need to get
the adults involved.

04:00.508 --> 04:03.544
We'll go.
Let's just make it snappy.

04:03.611 --> 04:04.812
[all cheering]

04:04.878 --> 04:06.547
- Our first away mission!

04:06.614 --> 04:13.521
* *

04:33.206 --> 04:36.276
- Ooh. Whoa.

04:36.344 --> 04:43.484
* *

04:45.786 --> 04:48.155
- It's so green.

04:50.057 --> 04:53.461
- Janeway, uh, taught you
how to land this thing, right?

04:53.527 --> 04:56.697
- I'm trying to concentrate.
Would you be quieter?

04:56.764 --> 04:57.731
Oh!

04:57.798 --> 05:01.902
* *

05:01.969 --> 05:04.004
[gasps] Whoa.

05:04.071 --> 05:11.178
* *

05:12.179 --> 05:13.681
Perfect.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.217
- Sorry, it's a short stop,

05:17.284 --> 05:19.453
but we can't
let you get out again.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.490
- That oughta hold you,
this time.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.260
- Whatever happened to
"under different circumstances,

05:27.327 --> 05:28.629
we could've been friends?"

05:28.696 --> 05:30.464
- I'll bring you back
a souvenir.

05:33.801 --> 05:37.304
- These are your tricorders,
useful for data sensing,

05:37.371 --> 05:39.707
analyzing,
and recording your findings.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.209
I've enabled them
to track locations.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.144
- Ooh.
- Wow.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.313
[laughs]

05:46.380 --> 05:47.715
- Interesting.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.784
Mine has already
detected a gas sample.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.286
- [laughs] Guilty.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.989
- Ah, the joys of being
non-corporeal.

05:56.056 --> 06:01.161
* *

06:01.228 --> 06:04.565
- Is this some sort
of disruptor?

06:04.632 --> 06:07.167
- A Federation Type 1 Phaser,

06:07.234 --> 06:09.570
only to be used
in an emergency.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.538
- [laughs]
[both mimicking Phaser firing]

06:10.604 --> 06:11.939
- But it'd be helpful

06:12.005 --> 06:14.442
if they were pointed
in the right direction.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.610
- [groans]
- Oh, wow.

06:16.677 --> 06:20.180
- Don't worry, that's why
the defaults are set to stun.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.985
- [gasps]
And what is that?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.954
- The "RUNAWAY."

06:27.020 --> 06:31.024
Accelerated ion propulsion,
Tritanium chassis,

06:31.091 --> 06:33.761
Holosteering, and my favorite,

06:33.827 --> 06:36.329
hold-on-to-your-butts
grab handles.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.232
- Aren't you glad
I ordered us off the ship?

06:39.299 --> 06:41.769
- Wow.
Oh, is that leather?

06:41.835 --> 06:43.871
- Check it out,
impulse steering.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.440
- There's only four seats.
You're not coming?

06:46.507 --> 06:48.275
- I wish I could,

06:48.341 --> 06:50.978
but holograms
can't leave the ship.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.247
Don't feel bad.
Murf will keep me company.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.849
- [chirps]

06:58.385 --> 07:00.020
- Now go.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.923
Explore, collect your samples,
and meet back in an hour.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.525
But more importantly...

07:04.592 --> 07:06.393
- Oh, finally.
- We'll be back.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.561
- [laughs] Jankom goes first!

07:07.628 --> 07:10.931
- Look out for each other.

07:10.998 --> 07:14.902
* *

07:14.968 --> 07:16.837
- Whoa.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.072
- Wow.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.875
- If I had a breath,
it would be taken away.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.580
- Thought this place
was supposed to be beautiful.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.582
- Janeway said
it's safe to breathe.

07:28.649 --> 07:33.120
- It's an alien world where
who knows what could happen?

07:33.186 --> 07:36.524
Jankom says the suit stays on.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.261
- Fascinating.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.565
There are no nutrients
in the soil

07:44.632 --> 07:47.635
but such an abundance of flora.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.337
Dal, how could this be? Dal?

07:50.403 --> 07:53.406
- Whoa!

07:53.473 --> 07:55.175
- Yeah!
- What are you doing?

07:55.242 --> 07:58.078
- You guys get samples!
Meet you back at the ship!

07:58.145 --> 08:02.149
- That is not very practical.
- Dal! Dal!

08:02.215 --> 08:06.086
- But I thought we were going
on an adventure together.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.822
Guys? Guys?

08:08.889 --> 08:12.225
[indistinct chatter]

08:12.292 --> 08:14.127
- Jankom Pog is hungry.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.730
- Ooh. Pretty.

08:16.797 --> 08:23.737
* *

08:31.378 --> 08:36.083
- [chirping]

08:36.149 --> 08:38.485
- You're smarter than you look.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.055
- [belches]

08:47.060 --> 08:48.862
- Maybe not.

08:48.929 --> 08:55.869
* *

09:25.966 --> 09:27.034
- [gasps]

09:29.469 --> 09:31.038
- Eat up, Murf.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.674
We're gonna have some fun.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.447
[dramatic music]

09:40.513 --> 09:43.516
* *

09:43.583 --> 09:47.855
- Stop. Whatever
you're planning to do--

09:47.921 --> 09:49.256
I'm starting to think

09:49.322 --> 09:51.358
you weren't just locked up
for space flu.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.393
If you think you're going
to fly out of here,

09:53.460 --> 09:55.128
I want you to know
you've already been

09:55.195 --> 09:57.564
locked out of all
ship controls and--

09:57.631 --> 09:59.066
[power whirs]

09:59.132 --> 10:00.634
Wait. How did you--

10:02.502 --> 10:06.707
- All this time, my father
taught me starship mechanics,

10:06.774 --> 10:10.143
astrophysics, linguistics,
information technology,

10:10.210 --> 10:13.246
and I never questioned why.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.883
He was preparing me
for this ship.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.686
- Janeway to Captain R'El,
your prisoner is loose

10:18.752 --> 10:21.088
and trying
to steal the Protostar.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.958
Captain.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.496
Captain, do you read me?
- Whoa.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.966
- I can't let you
take the ship.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.335
- I am reclaiming it
for my father.

10:35.402 --> 10:38.906
- This starship belongs
to the United Federation of--

10:38.972 --> 10:43.410
* *

10:43.476 --> 10:46.646
Which you now have
full command access to.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.949
How can I be of service?

10:49.016 --> 10:51.151
- Send a message.

10:51.218 --> 10:55.522
* *

10:55.588 --> 10:59.159
- Young progeny,
we have been looking for you.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.528
- I'm in the Hirogen
Star System.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.131
I need to talk to Our Diviner.

11:04.197 --> 11:07.034
I have control
of the Protostar.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.602
[device beeping]

11:12.672 --> 11:16.509
- [gasps] How curious.

11:16.576 --> 11:21.815
* *

11:21.882 --> 11:25.518
[gasps] Even more curious.

11:25.585 --> 11:31.825
* *

11:31.892 --> 11:34.828
- [grunting]

11:34.895 --> 11:39.900
* *

11:39.967 --> 11:42.469
[groans]

11:44.171 --> 11:47.407
Huh? [sniffing]

11:47.474 --> 11:50.010
Ah, ah.
That smell.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.812
Oh, can't be.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.782
[panting]

11:54.848 --> 11:56.516
Huh?

11:59.452 --> 12:02.622
Janeway said no one lived here.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.624
[sniffs, laughs]

12:04.691 --> 12:07.694
Jankom Pog can't wait
to tell her she's wrong.

12:07.761 --> 12:12.032
* *

12:12.099 --> 12:16.103
Uh, hello!

12:16.169 --> 12:19.272
[liquid bubbling]

12:21.174 --> 12:22.675
[sniffs] Oh!

12:22.742 --> 12:27.614
Just like the stew
on the Tellar Sleeper Ship.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.783
Ah, ah.

12:29.850 --> 12:33.120
One bite can't hurt, right?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.356
[device beeping]

12:36.423 --> 12:39.893
- Ooh, a life-form.
[giggles]

12:39.960 --> 12:41.995
Oops. Just me.

12:42.062 --> 12:49.169
* *

12:51.371 --> 12:53.373
That's weird.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.209
Still says there's
only one of us here.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.412
Don't be scared, little guy.
I won't hurt you.

13:01.514 --> 13:02.282
Hmm?

13:02.349 --> 13:05.252
[playful music]

13:05.318 --> 13:07.320
- [purring]

13:07.387 --> 13:10.323
- You're not scared.

13:10.390 --> 13:14.527
You wanna play, don't you?

13:14.594 --> 13:16.296
[gasps]
Oh, my gosh!

13:16.363 --> 13:18.498
Coochie-coo,
you're adorable!

13:18.565 --> 13:19.666
[laughs]

13:19.732 --> 13:22.235
Stop it!
[laughs]

13:22.302 --> 13:25.238
[dramatic music]

13:25.305 --> 13:32.212
* *

13:33.180 --> 13:36.449
- [gasps] Most curious of all.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.554
The engine of our ship.

13:41.621 --> 13:45.192
What is it doing down here?

13:45.258 --> 13:47.694
* *

13:47.760 --> 13:49.529
- Whoo-hoo!

13:49.596 --> 13:51.932
[laughs]

13:51.999 --> 13:58.939
* *

14:14.021 --> 14:16.589
Hello?

14:16.656 --> 14:18.992
It can't be.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.760
Hello!

14:22.795 --> 14:25.832
- You yearn to see
your parents,

14:25.899 --> 14:28.801
yet you don't remember
what they looked like.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.406
Can you believe this place?

14:33.473 --> 14:36.343
I could stay here forever.
Couldn't you?

14:36.409 --> 14:39.346
- Janeway said she can't
leave the ship.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.515
- [laughs]

14:42.582 --> 14:45.118
You're too smart
for your own good.

14:45.185 --> 14:48.121
- If you're not Janeway,
then who are you?

14:48.188 --> 14:51.324
- Consider me a representative.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.495
- I was told there's
no intelligent life here.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.565
- Life is everywhere.

14:59.967 --> 15:04.938
We have the ability
to see what you want

15:05.005 --> 15:06.773
and give it to you.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.380
We also sense your fear.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.951
You can stop running.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.720
The Diviner
won't find you here.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.524
We can protect you.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.327
But you have to stay.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.365
- Thanks, weird lady.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.067
Sounds like a sweet offer.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.969
- Stay.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.838
Stay.

15:38.905 --> 15:41.975
- [panting]

15:42.042 --> 15:44.044
- Stay!
- [screams]

15:44.111 --> 15:49.016
* *

15:49.082 --> 15:51.184
[gasps]

15:51.251 --> 15:53.520
Janeway!

15:57.424 --> 15:58.858
Dal to Zero.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.628
We have got to get off
this planet pronto.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.630
Do you--

16:03.696 --> 16:05.165
- The ship is prepared
for takeoff,

16:05.232 --> 16:08.501
but as your training advisor,
I must remind you,

16:08.568 --> 16:11.404
a Starfleet officer
never abandons her crew.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.206
- They're not my crew.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.076
Computer, initiate liftoff.
Full thrusters.

16:16.143 --> 16:22.782
* *

16:22.849 --> 16:25.218
Computer, stand by
to retract landing gear.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.919
[shouts]

16:26.986 --> 16:28.921
What was that? Report.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.358
- The landing struts
are obstructed.

16:31.424 --> 16:37.997
* *

16:43.436 --> 16:47.274
- Oh, you are a mystery.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.443
What does it mean?

16:50.510 --> 16:55.615
* *

16:58.017 --> 17:01.988
- Rok! Jankom!
Can anyone hear me?

17:02.055 --> 17:04.257
[device beeping]

17:04.324 --> 17:06.126
I hope that's one of us.

17:06.193 --> 17:13.133
* *

17:14.634 --> 17:16.636
[shouts] Got you.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.940
[sighs]

17:21.007 --> 17:23.476
- Dal? What happened?
How did you--

17:24.644 --> 17:26.413
[shrieks]
- Time to go.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.415
Hold-on-to-your-butt
grab handles!

17:28.481 --> 17:34.154
* *

17:34.221 --> 17:36.623
- The maze, it's sealing us in!

17:36.689 --> 17:38.825
This planet is remarkable!

17:38.891 --> 17:41.594
It acts as one superorganism,

17:41.661 --> 17:43.796
luring and consuming its prey
for nutrients.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.866
- You mean it wants to eat us.
- Eat us?

17:46.933 --> 17:50.137
It shows us what we want
by fabricating our desires

17:50.203 --> 17:51.504
onto its cilium.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.140
It's quite wondrous!

17:53.206 --> 17:55.175
- It's also trying to eat us.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.309
Hold on.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.912
* *

18:04.117 --> 18:05.885
- Rok should be
just over this hill.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.454
[dramatic music]

18:07.520 --> 18:08.788
[faint laughter]

18:08.855 --> 18:11.958
I can hear her. She's laughing.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.261
- [giggles] Stop it.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.896
[giggles]

18:16.963 --> 18:19.266
- Rok! Rok!

18:19.332 --> 18:21.000
Wake up!

18:22.302 --> 18:24.904
- Aren't they cute?

18:24.971 --> 18:28.408
[giggles]
Their kisses are so wet!

18:28.475 --> 18:30.009
- Wake up!
- Coochie-coo.

18:30.076 --> 18:33.313
[giggles]
You're adorable. I love you.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.715
Mm! Huh?

18:35.782 --> 18:38.718
[groaning]

18:38.785 --> 18:45.124
* *

18:45.192 --> 18:47.994
Where'd they go?

18:48.060 --> 18:50.230
They liked me.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.365
- They were not real.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.169
- I don't like this place.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.271
I wanna go back to the ship.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.673
- Not without Jankom.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.476
* *

19:03.543 --> 19:06.513
- [grunting]

19:06.579 --> 19:08.014
What?

19:09.949 --> 19:13.453
But--but--
but it tasted so real!

19:13.520 --> 19:14.987
- The spores we came
into contact with

19:15.054 --> 19:17.424
clouded our minds
and senses.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.591
- Hold on!

19:18.658 --> 19:20.126
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.529
Why was Jankom rescued last?

19:22.595 --> 19:29.536
* *

19:32.705 --> 19:35.642
- My progeny.

19:35.708 --> 19:40.747
* *

19:40.813 --> 19:43.250
- How did you get here so fast?

19:43.316 --> 19:46.253
- I was impatient to see you.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.020
- You're out of your chamber.

19:48.087 --> 19:52.925
- Would you deny me the joy
of seeing you alive and well?

19:52.992 --> 19:54.861
- I'm sorry.
I meant...

19:54.927 --> 19:58.130
I am pleased, Our Diviner.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.199
We should go.

20:00.267 --> 20:03.436
- Let us remain here
for a moment longer.

20:03.503 --> 20:06.306
- But the others are coming.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.341
I've given you your ship.

20:08.408 --> 20:12.178
- You've done well, my progeny.

20:12.245 --> 20:16.949
My Gwyndala, I am proud of you.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.887
* *

20:20.953 --> 20:22.555
- You are not my father.

20:22.622 --> 20:27.126
* *

20:27.193 --> 20:29.095
- Stay!

20:30.863 --> 20:32.565
Stay!

20:32.632 --> 20:39.071
* *

20:41.274 --> 20:43.175
- There it is! The Protostar!

20:43.242 --> 20:45.244
- Janeway, if you can hear me,

20:45.312 --> 20:46.846
prep the Protostar
for takeoff!

20:46.913 --> 20:50.182
* *

20:50.249 --> 20:52.151
Great! We're coming in hot.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.088
No! No!
No, not that hot!

20:56.155 --> 20:58.925
I said prep the Protostar,
not fly away!

20:58.991 --> 21:06.132
* *

21:08.267 --> 21:10.470
- Come on, Gwyn,
you can do this.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.004
- The nacelles are entangled.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.741
Cilia has infiltrated
the ventral superstructure.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.710
Command-and-control systems
are offline.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.714
- All systems are critical.
Prepare to abandon ship.

21:21.781 --> 21:25.084
- I do not accept!
My father needs this ship.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.386
- You can't break free.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.720
This ship is going down,

21:27.787 --> 21:29.088
and if you don't find
a way off,

21:29.155 --> 21:30.357
you're going down with it.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.859
Get out of here!

21:32.925 --> 21:36.295
- All systems are critical.
Prepare to abandon ship.

21:36.363 --> 21:43.470
* *

21:51.644 --> 21:54.947
Ten seconds to emergency
engine shutdown.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.350
- The shuttlecraft.

21:57.417 --> 22:01.287
- Nine, eight...

22:01.354 --> 22:03.089
- [grunts]

22:03.155 --> 22:06.225
- Seven, six...

22:06.292 --> 22:07.994
- [whimpering]

22:08.060 --> 22:11.664
- Five, four.

22:11.731 --> 22:18.671
* *

22:31.818 --> 22:33.019
[both gasp]

22:33.085 --> 22:39.659
* *

22:47.366 --> 22:50.737
- [grunts]
- Gwyn!

22:50.803 --> 22:53.940
- [panting]

22:55.542 --> 22:57.243
You stranded us all.

22:57.309 --> 23:00.246
- [whimpering]

23:00.312 --> 23:07.420
* *
