WEBVTT

01:41.727 --> 01:45.903
I remember the
first time I set foot in Africa.

01:45.981 --> 01:48.484
Thought I'd hate if just
like Iraq, you know?

01:48.609 --> 01:54.287
Figured, it's just more fucking
sand to kill each other over.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.617
But I was wrong.

01:56.742 --> 02:00.622
It was the most beautiful
place I ever seen.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.348
Took my fucking breath away.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.805
Then I signed with Red
Mountain after my second tour.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.812
You know they offered four
times what the Army paid?

02:20.891 --> 02:23.314
Better equipment,
choose your deployments.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.612
My family's piss-poor,

02:25.687 --> 02:27.940
so I thought I hit the lottery.

02:28.023 --> 02:31.152
You know? Get rich to
make the world safe?

02:31.276 --> 02:33.529
Fuck, yeah.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.913
Yeah, so much for that.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.858
Hey, hey.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.935
Get us out of here!

04:43.200 --> 04:44.952
Oh, shit!

04:48.038 --> 04:51.212
Go, back it up!
Get us out of here!

05:14.272 --> 05:16.900
Fuck.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.537
Aah!

05:29.454 --> 05:30.922
Are you alive?

05:30.997 --> 05:32.920
Yeah, I'm alive.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.679
Fuck.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.229
There you go.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.356
I hope that's
not the bait knife.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.613
The fish hate you, you know.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.194
You think?

06:00.318 --> 06:02.696
Yeah. Fish
like older men.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.033
If you read more, you'd
know about these things.

06:06.116 --> 06:10.667
And because they hate you,
we haven't caught anything.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.540
Now, why is it they
hate me, exactly?

06:14.624 --> 06:19.801
Animals in the natural world
are drawn to the souls of men.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.223
They can see the light

06:21.298 --> 06:23.175
that emits from inside us.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.555
Well, is this a theory,

06:24.634 --> 06:26.011
or something you read, or...?

06:26.094 --> 06:28.222
Yeah, in a book in the library.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.397
Library.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.520
You've never been
to the fucking library.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.898
It's called Shamanistic Spirit Animals.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.236
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.566
My point is, you've got no soul.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.822
And there's no light inside,
and they know that.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.325
They see it.
They smell it.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.248
But fish can't smell.

06:50.452 --> 06:54.457
You are drunker than me, Frank.

06:56.791 --> 07:00.136
Are you ready to do this?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.143
No.

07:19.606 --> 07:23.281
I can't believe
it's been a year.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.807
At least they're together.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.894
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.648
- You know...
- What?

07:56.768 --> 07:59.237
The shortest distance

07:59.312 --> 08:03.112
between two points
is a straight line.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.317
Yeah.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.319
That's brilliant.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.071
Why are we not doing it?

08:20.291 --> 08:21.668
- We made it.
- Oh, shit.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.546
We left the couch on the beach.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.132
Where are you going to sleep?

08:28.717 --> 08:30.719
I'll sleep on the floor.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.519
That's because you're
such a hard ass.

08:34.639 --> 08:40.020
No, it's because...
because I love your rug.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.235
Want some water?

08:45.066 --> 08:49.116
All rivers run into the sea

08:49.195 --> 08:52.574
if the sea is not full.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.005
Good night, Frank.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.293
Where are you going?

09:02.417 --> 09:06.763
I'm going to...
go for a walk.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.341
Travis?

09:12.427 --> 09:15.226
They loved you.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.860
Don't forget that.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.412
Thanks, man.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.286
Do me a favor, don't
do it out here.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.296
Wouldn't dream of it.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.710
Hey, daddy.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.885
You liking the girls tonight?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.136
I don't go to strip clubs.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.381
I got a wife and kid.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.984
Hey! The door is jammed.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.193
Somebody open the door!

10:44.310 --> 10:47.109
Hold on a second.
Hold on, I got it, I got it.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.610
Here, take this.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.988
What the fuck?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.409
Open this door!

10:59.492 --> 11:01.790
Come on, open it!

11:01.870 --> 11:03.338
Hold on, I got it.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.877
All right, just give me a sec.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.093
Come on, open it!

11:08.168 --> 11:09.761
Open it!

11:11.838 --> 11:14.512
I got it.
Hold on, hold on.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.849
Here you are. Here you go.
Open up...

11:26.394 --> 11:27.646
Can I help you guys?

11:27.729 --> 11:29.447
We're Red Mountain!

11:29.522 --> 11:31.570
We're supposed to find you.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.658
Jim Morrow sent us.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.157
I told Jim I'm on hiatus.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.988
What the fuck?

11:37.071 --> 11:38.539
It's some kind of emergency.

11:38.656 --> 11:41.375
It's always an emergency
with you guys.

11:41.492 --> 11:44.712
Jesus Christ.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.520
Shake them titties.

12:10.271 --> 12:15.198
You know, they
were my best guys.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.374
I'm not impressed.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.790
So, you don't call,

12:24.911 --> 12:26.333
blow off my checks.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.163
Uh-huh.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.965
You know, I feel like a
prom date the day after.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.131
Well, I told you, I'm
on hiatus, you know?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.254
I know. I know.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.840
So, what do you want?

12:36.923 --> 12:39.767
I want you to have a drink.

12:39.884 --> 12:40.680
Hmm?

12:40.760 --> 12:44.310
Try a peanut.
They're great.

12:45.556 --> 12:49.982
I want you to put a pin in your
vacation for a couple days.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.655
I need you to kill
somebody for us.

12:52.772 --> 12:53.648
Mm-hmm.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.695
You do that for me,

12:54.774 --> 12:57.368
zip back here and
resume your reflection.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.572
Just call me on Monday
when I'm back, huh?

13:00.655 --> 13:02.623
It can't wait till Monday.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.285
Then get somebody else.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.704
You really need me
to say it, huh?

13:07.787 --> 13:10.210
You want to hear it?
Okay.

13:10.290 --> 13:14.011
Red don't want nobody else.
They want you.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.925
They want the best.

13:16.004 --> 13:16.846
How about that?

13:16.963 --> 13:19.136
Still tough shit. I
don't work for anybody.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.180
I'm an independent contractor.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.803
- Yeah.
- Like you used to be.

13:22.927 --> 13:28.024
Yeah, they're well aware
of your free agency.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.314
Well...

13:32.478 --> 13:34.355
thank you for the drinks.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.572
I'm leaving.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.820
You want to hear me out?

13:36.941 --> 13:40.616
No, I don't.
Say hi to Jasmin.

13:41.946 --> 13:45.826
Wetzler's offering
a million a day.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.290
One million.

13:56.461 --> 14:00.216
That is a suspiciously
high number, even for him.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.217
Yeah, well,

14:02.342 --> 14:04.310
the job comes with a mop.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.638
Somebody else fucked it up.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.520
How high are you
authorized to go?

14:09.640 --> 14:10.562
One point five.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.028
Wow. And you take
your usual cut.

14:14.145 --> 14:14.941
You know what?

14:15.021 --> 14:17.695
I don't do this for
laughs no more, buddy.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.034
Oh, shit.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.705
You get that offer
doubled and I'm in.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.373
There you go.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.879
There he is.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.421
There's your target.

14:36.542 --> 14:40.046
His name's Keith Zera.
He's 26 years old.

14:40.171 --> 14:41.844
He's one of their own?

14:41.923 --> 14:43.220
Mm, he was.

14:43.299 --> 14:47.805
He's now scheduled to testify on
camera for a U.N. investigation.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.935
- Against Red Mountain?
- Mm-hmm.

14:50.056 --> 14:50.852
For what?

14:50.932 --> 14:53.526
See, I just got you two
million reasons a day

14:53.601 --> 14:56.229
why the answer to that
question doesn't matter.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.948
Now here's what matters.

14:59.065 --> 15:03.070
Yesterday while in transit
across the Namibian border,

15:03.194 --> 15:04.537
an attempt was made on his life.

15:04.612 --> 15:08.242
And now Interpol, they've
hidden him off grid.

15:08.616 --> 15:12.041
They're sending somebody to take
his deposition in the field,

15:12.120 --> 15:14.418
but the location's unknown.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.416
When's that going to happen?

15:16.541 --> 15:17.758
Sometime Friday afternoon.

15:17.875 --> 15:22.005
So I got 72 hours to find this
whistle blowing do-gooder

15:22.088 --> 15:24.807
somewhere in Africa,
and terminate him.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.097
- There you go.
- What went wrong the first time?

15:27.218 --> 15:28.811
Red Mountain used local militia,

15:28.928 --> 15:31.807
tried to make it look like
a kidnapping gone wrong.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.434
- Numb nuts.
- Fucking stupid.

15:34.559 --> 15:35.651
You see,

15:35.768 --> 15:41.446
they underestimated one element
of his protection team.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.576
Her name's Lin Bisset.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.747
Now, she's the last
person seen with him...

15:47.822 --> 15:53.079
and the reason
he's still breathing.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.084
Interpol, huh?

15:55.163 --> 15:56.210
Huh.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.291
Mother of one?

15:59.667 --> 16:01.135
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.504
I don't worry about that part.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.801
It's starting to feel
kind of ugly, Jim.

16:04.922 --> 16:08.301
Yeah, well, they're all ugly.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.225
$25 billion corporation
involved.

16:11.304 --> 16:15.684
Half the U.S. Senate is
beholden to Red Mountain.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.482
I know. I know. I know.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.572
It's bullshit.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.651
But they want him taken out.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.198
Keep reading, pal.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.327
We're wheels up in 10.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.046
How did you do it?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.169
I fell at' work.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.171
You know how clumsy I can be.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.594
Are you minding
your grandmother?

16:47.673 --> 16:48.970
Not really.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.519
Christopher.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.558
When are you coming home, Mom?

16:53.679 --> 16:56.273
Tomorrow night.
I promise.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.522
Okay. I can't wait
to see you.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.976
- Yes?
- Hi.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.732
I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.570
I'm not even sure if I
have the right address.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.941
I'm looking for an old
friend, Lin Bisset.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.818
We spent a semester abroad
together at Oxford.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.323
Uh, yes.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.451
That's my daughter.
What's your name, sir?

17:52.530 --> 17:55.500
My name is Dennis Merrick.
I'm from the States.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.669
Is she here? Could I--
Could I speak to her?

17:57.743 --> 18:00.041
Unfortunately, no.
But if you like,

18:00.121 --> 18:01.338
I can tell her you came by.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.882
All right, I appreciate that.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.668
Dennis Merrick, okay?
From Oxford?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.253
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:07.378 --> 18:07.844
Um...

18:07.920 --> 18:10.639
actually, if it's not
too much of a bother,

18:10.756 --> 18:13.600
I was really excited about
the chance to surprise her.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.392
And do you know
where she might be?

18:16.470 --> 18:17.596
How I could find her?

18:17.722 --> 18:19.349
She's flying home tonight.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.775
Is that Lin's son?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.518
We Skyped last night.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.569
She hurt her hand,

18:23.644 --> 18:25.021
so she's coming home early.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.072
Who are you, anyway?

18:27.148 --> 18:28.741
I'm Dennis Merrick.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.567
From Virginia.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.902
Old friend of your mom's.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.158
Never heard of you before.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.155
Christopher!

18:34.280 --> 18:35.327
It's all right.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.532
He's just watching
his mother's back.

18:36.616 --> 18:40.086
I respect that. I got a son
about the same age as you.

18:40.161 --> 18:43.256
What are you, 10 and a half?

18:43.331 --> 18:44.924
Yeah.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.717
What is that?

18:46.792 --> 18:48.339
Is that a Wolverine bag?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.462
Can I--
Can I see that?

18:49.587 --> 18:52.306
See, I went to the store today

18:52.381 --> 18:53.928
to get one of these for my son,

18:54.008 --> 18:56.102
but all they had was the Hulk.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.846
So I didn't get one.
I don't know why...

18:58.971 --> 19:00.814
Because the Hulk sucks.

19:00.931 --> 19:01.898
Yeah.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.692
That's right.
Because the Hulk sucks.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.566
All right, listen, you
two, thank you so much.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.774
And, you know, I hope we get
to meet again sometime.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.483
Bye-bye.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.534
Identification.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.702
Yeah, Yankees suck.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.792
What can / do for you,
Mr. Conrad?

19:19.867 --> 19:21.244
Yeah, I need
the passenger manifests

19:21.327 --> 19:24.672
for every flight departing
from Cape Town, South Africa,

19:24.789 --> 19:28.510
inbound for Hong Kong
in the next 30 hours.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.963
Hey, you guys know
an 11-letter word

20:14.046 --> 20:16.014
for "traveling saint"?

20:16.090 --> 20:16.932
I don't know.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.098
No idea? You didn't
go to Sunday school, huh?

20:20.219 --> 20:21.812
All right.

20:21.887 --> 20:22.979
Thanks, guys.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.147
Safe travels.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.897
Hey, you know an 11-letter
word for "traveling saint"?

20:27.017 --> 20:28.519
Sorry.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.445
Nothing, huh?
I knew it.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.405
Excuse me, do...

20:31.522 --> 20:34.696
forgive me, but do you
know an 11-letter word

20:34.775 --> 20:37.528
for "traveling saint"?

20:44.368 --> 20:46.871
I do a lot of traveling
for work internationally.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.298
I'm trying to learn
a little bit as I go.

20:49.415 --> 20:52.385
Obviously I need to learn more.

20:53.961 --> 20:57.431
You have a nice flight, too.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.445
I'm going to need another beer.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.665
Here you go.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.504
Thank you.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.794
- No, no, no. Fuck off, man.
- What'd you say?

21:30.915 --> 21:34.840
I said that's
my girlfriend's seat.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.305
Christopher.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.269
I'm sorry.

21:48.349 --> 21:49.601
St. Christopher.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.687
Eleven letters.

21:53.521 --> 21:55.990
Nicely done.
Thank you.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.484
My son's name.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.988
Really? Huh.

22:02.488 --> 22:05.583
What happened?
You miss your flight?

22:05.658 --> 22:06.659
Canceled.

22:06.784 --> 22:09.128
1:00 p.m. tomorrow.

22:09.203 --> 22:10.705
Oh, damn.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.423
I thought I had it bad.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.001
Got about 6 1/2 hours to kill.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.504
I know a much better
restaurant than this.

22:18.629 --> 22:22.008
Can I take you out to dinner?

22:26.387 --> 22:27.684
All right.

22:27.805 --> 22:30.024
Let's settle up here.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.151
What happened to your hand?

22:36.689 --> 22:39.192
A work accident.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.693
A work accident?

22:40.818 --> 22:42.616
That sounds suspicious.

22:42.695 --> 22:47.747
What do you do?

22:49.034 --> 22:50.752
I think I'm starting
to like you,

22:50.870 --> 22:52.918
so I don't want to answer that.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.416
So you're a stripper.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.464
No.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.385
No, no.

22:58.502 --> 23:01.426
Let's just say that, um...

23:01.547 --> 23:04.596
my company tries to convince
people to buy things

23:04.717 --> 23:08.563
by persuading them they
can't live without them.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.272
And is that what you're
doing right now?

23:13.392 --> 23:16.191
Trying to convince me to buy?

23:16.562 --> 23:18.439
I don't think of myself
as a product,

23:18.564 --> 23:22.410
and I certainly don't think
of you as a customer.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.919
Don't you have
someone back home?

23:34.580 --> 23:36.753
I did.

23:38.125 --> 23:42.255
I lost my wife and son
a year ago this week.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.455
Hey, Jim.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.578
Yeah, I got the target location.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.125
Hey, salesman!

26:23.123 --> 26:24.420
Uh...

26:24.541 --> 26:26.760
let me call you back.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.929
I was just leaving
you a message.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.218
Shut up!
On your knees.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.799
All right, Lin,
put the gun down.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.597
- Everything's all right--
- Knees! Now!

26:33.717 --> 26:36.266
- Now!
- All right--yes, yes, yes!

27:26.603 --> 27:29.982
I miss you, Daddy.

27:30.941 --> 27:33.660
When are you coming home?

28:04.224 --> 28:07.353
You're welcome, asshole.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.023
Love you, pal.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.151
I'm sorry.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.737
We have a heartbeat.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.205
Help me!

28:23.202 --> 28:26.422
What's his name?

28:27.706 --> 28:29.583
Do you want him back or not?

28:29.666 --> 28:31.339
What's his fucking name?

28:31.418 --> 28:32.135
Travis.

28:32.211 --> 28:35.090
Travis. Travis.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.302
My name is Helen.
I'm a doctor.

28:41.094 --> 28:44.394
Just follow the
sound of my voice.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.226
Just stay here with me.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.399
It's all going to be okay.

28:49.519 --> 28:50.645
His pulse is stabilizing.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.902
Just stay here with me, Travis.

28:53.023 --> 28:53.865
There we go.

28:53.941 --> 28:56.364
You're doing well.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.410
Hey, man.

29:08.705 --> 29:11.925
What the hell's going on, huh?

29:13.627 --> 29:16.301
The Interpol agent...

29:17.256 --> 29:19.600
she shot you.

29:19.716 --> 29:22.640
Do you remember?

29:24.054 --> 29:24.896
She killed you.

29:24.972 --> 29:28.943
And we just brought you back
from the abyss, my friend.

29:29.059 --> 29:31.653
That's impossible.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.443
Well, it's not, actually.

29:33.563 --> 29:38.694
Red Mountain, they've been
developing this procedure

29:38.777 --> 29:41.030
for years now.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.740
And you wouldn't believe

29:42.823 --> 29:45.292
what they've done
to make this work.

29:45.409 --> 29:49.289
Truth is, some of it's
pretty fucked up,

29:49.413 --> 29:51.757
and...

29:54.960 --> 29:56.257
...it's classified.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.464
What do you mean
it's classified?

29:58.588 --> 30:00.010
How come you didn't tell me?

30:00.132 --> 30:02.806
Top clearance, Travis.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.186
Or, quite simply,

30:05.304 --> 30:09.480
because you hadn't
been killed yet.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.274
Moments prior to your
death, you made a call

30:13.353 --> 30:15.606
stating that you knew the
location of the safe house

30:15.689 --> 30:19.569
where Keith Zera is
making his deposition.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.871
Do you remember the location?

30:29.328 --> 30:31.456
We've less than two hours

30:31.538 --> 30:33.757
before he makes his deposition.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.676
This information is vital.

30:37.461 --> 30:40.840
1220 Longmarket, Room 102.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.434
You're certain of that?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.315
Yeah.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.391
Good.

30:51.516 --> 30:55.146
This fucking procedure
is finally paying off.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.105
This is on you.
Kill Zera.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.486
- Personally.
- Personally?

30:58.565 --> 31:00.112
I'm sorry, is that a problem?

31:00.192 --> 31:02.661
I'm a handler now, sir.

31:02.736 --> 31:05.034
No more wet work.

31:05.155 --> 31:06.452
I gave my word.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.783
To whom?
Your wife?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.334
Jim, this is the
moment, you realize,

31:09.409 --> 31:12.413
that the unseen line between
friendship and profession

31:12.537 --> 31:15.916
is not where you thought it was.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.003
And because Conrad went soft

31:19.086 --> 31:20.679
and let the Interpol agent live,

31:20.754 --> 31:24.384
you'll take care of her as well.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.727
Yes, sir.

31:30.347 --> 31:34.352
Now, this is it, Travis.

31:34.434 --> 31:37.904
You're one hell of a weapon.

31:41.441 --> 31:43.535
Godspeed.

31:54.788 --> 31:59.464
Hey, Jim, get me off this thing.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.552
I can't do that.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.177
What do you mean?

32:08.260 --> 32:12.606
This was always
going to be a patch job.

32:13.390 --> 32:16.564
You're never going
to leave this box.

32:22.899 --> 32:26.494
I'm going to get
the doc in here.

32:27.112 --> 32:32.915
Give you something
to make it go quick.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.922
We've done some
fucked-up things.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.470
This is how it ends, buddy.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.644
I'm sorry.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.572
Jim? Jim?

33:11.031 --> 33:11.827
Jim!

33:43.355 --> 33:44.447
Hydromorphone.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.901
It's a very powerful narcotic.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.325
I know what it is.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.371
It's such a waste.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.044
I'm sorry.

34:17.097 --> 34:19.520
What is happening to me?

34:19.599 --> 34:21.476
You're going to die.
Again.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.779
- How do I stop it?
- You can't.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.444
- Who knows more than you?
- No one!

34:26.565 --> 34:27.942
I designed the procedure.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.068
Your body will reject
the drug cocktail.

34:30.193 --> 34:32.366
Your mental faculties
will break down.

34:32.445 --> 34:35.824
Even if you survive that,
which no one ever has,

34:35.907 --> 34:37.409
there's a built-in
fail safe.

34:37.534 --> 34:40.036
- The Lazarus unit.
- How long do I have?

34:40.120 --> 34:42.373
How long do I have?!

34:46.960 --> 34:50.134
You have less than
24 hours to live.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.943
Secure the perimeter!

35:36.801 --> 35:39.975
All right, come on,
move, move, move.

35:50.106 --> 35:53.827
What are you doing here?

35:54.152 --> 35:57.452
You're not supposed to be here.

36:03.203 --> 36:04.580
Adam...

36:07.666 --> 36:10.010
What's happening to me?

36:11.503 --> 36:13.676
You're hallucinating.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.805
It's a side effect of the drugs.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.811
I'd run if I were you.

36:20.887 --> 36:21.809
I made the mistake

36:21.888 --> 36:25.734
of not killing a woman
once already today.

36:27.519 --> 36:31.319
Don't make me regret this.

36:46.996 --> 36:49.044
I'm sorry.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.181
Travis, you disappeared on me.

36:57.257 --> 37:00.557
Believe me, you have no idea

37:00.635 --> 37:02.433
how much I wish I was there.

37:02.512 --> 37:05.015
Well, where are you?

37:08.727 --> 37:10.729
I'm in South Africa.

37:10.854 --> 37:12.856
Jesus.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.696
I'm not coming back, okay?

37:15.775 --> 37:17.573
Not, uh...

37:18.403 --> 37:19.325
not ever.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.532
What?
What's wrong?

37:21.614 --> 37:23.332
I'm in a bad way, Frank.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.751
Bad like what?

37:24.868 --> 37:26.336
Well...

37:26.411 --> 37:28.209
oh, um...

37:28.288 --> 37:29.915
let's say bad as it gets.

37:30.039 --> 37:33.418
It all caught up with me, pal.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.755
You were right.

37:37.130 --> 37:40.760
I don't think I do have a soul.

37:41.384 --> 37:42.385
Probably never did.

37:42.469 --> 37:47.066
You were such
a great father-in-law.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.767
You really were.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.865
I wasn't there for them.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.361
No excuses.

37:56.441 --> 38:02.289
Travis, you meant everything
to Kate and Adam.

38:03.072 --> 38:05.166
Don't give up.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.900
Hey, taxi.

38:30.975 --> 38:31.897
Taxi!

38:31.976 --> 38:33.193
Give me that cell phone.

38:33.311 --> 38:36.064
All right, now give me the keys.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.149
Give me the keys.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.373
We'd been working security
on a crude pipeline

38:49.494 --> 38:52.589
stretching from interior Congo
to the coast.

38:57.001 --> 38:59.629
And one day we got a
call for reassignment.

38:59.712 --> 39:02.932
By "we," you
mean who specifically?

39:03.007 --> 39:05.180
Rapid-deploy unit.

39:05.301 --> 39:07.724
Red Mountain's top crew.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.223
We'd been...

39:09.347 --> 39:11.896
we'd been all over.

39:12.475 --> 39:16.446
So our orders were to be
in Namibia by next morning.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.657
So tell me about the
events of that morning,

39:18.731 --> 39:20.825
June the 7th last year.

39:21.484 --> 39:24.328
We traveled through the night.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.827
Fifty kilometers
northwest of the border.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.910
It was real remote bush,
you know?

39:30.034 --> 39:34.130
Typically, we'd take in two SU\/s
or maybe even a Blackhawk,

39:34.205 --> 39:36.754
so I was surprised
when I was told

39:36.875 --> 39:38.377
to bring up heavy equipment.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.721
What kind of equipment?

39:42.213 --> 39:46.559
Two loaders, a dozer,
and a dump truck.

39:47.093 --> 39:50.848
They took us out to
a remote container yard.

39:50.930 --> 39:55.026
And what
was inside, Mr. Zera?

39:59.397 --> 40:00.569
Bodies.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.739
Everywhere. The place
was packed with them.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.613
Militia bodies?

40:09.365 --> 40:10.867
Civilian.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.794
Men, women, and kids.

40:13.912 --> 40:17.507
Was there indication
of how they died?

40:17.582 --> 40:20.552
No. Not' at' first'.

40:20.627 --> 40:22.971
At least not to us-

40:23.588 --> 40:25.386
And then, yeah,
we started noticing

40:25.465 --> 40:27.433
that each one had scars
0/7 their chests

40:27.550 --> 40:29.348
and on their wrists.

40:29.469 --> 40:32.313
Turns out they'd been medically
fucking experimented on.

40:32.430 --> 40:36.776
And how many bodies
would you say?

40:36.893 --> 40:38.520
I'd say at least 70.

40:39.354 --> 40:41.106
By that night, we'd dug a pit

40:41.230 --> 40:42.903
half the size
of a football field,

40:42.982 --> 40:45.235
and we burned and buried them.

40:45.318 --> 40:48.447
Each one.
All 70.

40:48.571 --> 40:52.451
All into a single mass grave?

40:56.955 --> 40:58.298
Yeah.

40:58.373 --> 40:59.966
Which was when they reminded us

41:00.083 --> 41:01.710
about our confidentiality
agreements,

41:01.793 --> 41:04.012
and told us that
we'd each be getting

41:04.128 --> 41:08.429
a $50,000 danger pay bonus.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.346
You know, I took
two tours of Iraq,

41:12.470 --> 41:16.020
so, yeah, I've seen some shit.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.392
But I...

41:17.475 --> 41:21.321
I never signed up to burn a dump
truck full of dead civilians.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.860
And that is something
I will never,

41:23.982 --> 41:27.577
ever get out of my head
as long as I live.

41:28.695 --> 41:32.791
How long have
you worked for Red Mountain?

41:38.997 --> 41:40.340
Get down!

41:42.542 --> 41:45.170
Move! Move! Move!

41:45.294 --> 41:47.717
Shit!

41:54.470 --> 41:56.643
Stay down!

42:07.734 --> 42:10.658
- Go! Now!
- Move!

42:11.237 --> 42:13.456
All right, move in.
Take them out.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.329
Roger that.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.293
- This way. Hug the walls.
- Move, move move!

42:17.368 --> 42:19.666
Get to that door!

42:27.420 --> 42:29.422
Get down!

42:31.049 --> 42:32.892
Let's go.

42:35.803 --> 42:38.022
Come on.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.798
Get up.

43:29.941 --> 43:30.783
Get in the car.

43:30.900 --> 43:33.278
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.528
Drive!

43:34.612 --> 43:39.118
Well, look who it is.
The $2 million man.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.541
Do not ever point
a gun at me again.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.213
Drive.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.837
All right, all right. Hold your horses.
Here we go.

43:55.091 --> 43:57.344
You seem to be
a pretty popular man.

43:57.426 --> 43:58.393
What do you have
on Red Mountain?

43:58.469 --> 44:00.267
- That's classified.
- I don't give a shit.

44:00.346 --> 44:01.768
What do you have on them?

44:01.848 --> 44:04.021
I got enough to bring the
whole fucking thing down.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.147
Who the fuck are you?

44:05.226 --> 44:07.194
I'm your assassin. If you don't
stop pointing that gun at me.

44:07.311 --> 44:10.235
- I'll point the fucking gun--
- Hey, calm down!

44:11.649 --> 44:13.367
Oh, shit.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.665
Oh, shit!

44:22.243 --> 44:24.917
Goddamn, what the hell do
you have on these guys?

44:28.124 --> 44:31.003
- Get down!
- Oh, shit.

44:35.464 --> 44:36.886
Wake the fuck up!

44:37.008 --> 44:40.012
Oh, shit!

44:42.722 --> 44:44.474
Oh, shit.

44:57.195 --> 44:59.163
You're going to kill us all.

44:59.238 --> 45:00.865
You'd be dead already
if it wasn't for me.

45:00.990 --> 45:03.960
You just said you were here
to kill the man I'm protecting.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.537
So forgive me
if I don't trust you.

45:05.661 --> 45:07.004
Trust you?

45:07.079 --> 45:08.001
You just shot me.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.550
Would you two just get
your fucking shit together?

45:48.246 --> 45:49.122
Are you okay?

45:49.247 --> 45:50.624
Am I okay?

45:50.706 --> 45:52.333
Yeah, a shot of morphine,
a couple stitches,

45:52.416 --> 45:54.544
I'm fucking golden.

45:55.753 --> 45:58.882
Well, don't go to the
same doctor I did.

46:04.053 --> 46:06.055
Oh, shit.

46:20.278 --> 46:22.406
Roll out.

46:47.138 --> 46:49.687
Let me see, all right?

47:05.364 --> 47:08.459
I don't want to go like this.

47:16.792 --> 47:19.295
I'm sorry.

47:27.678 --> 47:30.477
See you in 16 hours.

47:57.124 --> 48:00.048
I'm good. I'm good.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.687
Where's the card?

48:09.762 --> 48:11.480
The card?
Sure.

48:11.555 --> 48:15.685
Fucking memory
card, where is it?

48:15.768 --> 48:16.815
I have no idea.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.066
"I have no idea," huh?

48:18.187 --> 48:21.157
You didn't look,
you didn't check.

48:21.232 --> 48:21.903
No.

48:22.024 --> 48:23.697
Our orders were very clear, sir.

48:23.776 --> 48:27.406
Neutralize the target,
recover the cam--

48:28.906 --> 48:31.500
Get the fuck out of here.

48:31.575 --> 48:33.077
Go.

48:40.292 --> 48:41.043
Sir?

48:41.127 --> 48:43.596
Status?

48:45.256 --> 48:46.473
Incomplete.

48:46.590 --> 48:49.469
This is your third
major fuck-up.

48:49.593 --> 48:54.440
I don't care what you have to
do or who you have to kill,

48:54.557 --> 48:55.729
finish it.

48:55.850 --> 48:57.227
I've spent over
a billion dollars

48:57.309 --> 49:00.062
on this procedure to change
the face of warfare-

49:00.146 --> 49:01.363
- I get it.
- Do you?

49:01.439 --> 49:05.069
Do you realize
what's on the line here...

49:05.151 --> 49:09.281
for me, for you,

49:09.405 --> 49:11.624
for your family?

49:13.993 --> 49:15.336
Sir.

49:29.508 --> 49:30.634
Give me a secure line.

49:30.759 --> 49:32.853
Identification?

49:32.970 --> 49:34.267
Red Sox suck.

49:34.346 --> 49:38.146
What can I do for you,
Mr. Morrow?

49:40.019 --> 49:42.647
Green-light Hong Kong.

49:44.190 --> 49:45.817
Now.

49:57.203 --> 49:59.171
When they find out you
have that deposition,

49:59.288 --> 50:02.542
they're going to come at you
with everything they've got.

50:02.625 --> 50:03.877
He tried to do the right thing.

50:04.001 --> 50:07.175
Yeah, well they should
chisel that on his grave.

50:07.296 --> 50:11.597
- Now what?
- Take this car.

50:11.717 --> 50:13.594
Go home. Go back to your life.

50:13.677 --> 50:17.432
Send somebody back
for the bodies.

50:17.515 --> 50:21.019
What do you mean, bodies?

50:21.352 --> 50:26.529
I've only got 16 hours and
4 minutes left to live.

50:27.066 --> 50:29.615
That's my personal
"on and off" switch,

50:29.693 --> 50:31.787
compliments of Red Mountain.

50:31.862 --> 50:34.490
This is as far as I go.

50:34.949 --> 50:36.701
It's a fucked-up
outfit, Lin.

50:36.825 --> 50:41.001
Somebody's got to do
something about it.

50:42.706 --> 50:44.003
Just not me.

50:50.464 --> 50:51.511
Hello?

50:51.590 --> 50:54.935
Can I speak to Travis, please?

50:56.428 --> 50:58.556
It's someone for you.

51:02.893 --> 51:04.270
- Hello?
- There he is.

51:04.395 --> 51:07.774
My friend, the dead guy.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.118
You have no idea.

51:11.235 --> 51:13.704
And Zera?

51:14.071 --> 51:15.448
He's even deader.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.747
Congratulations, pal.
You're wet again.

51:18.867 --> 51:21.416
We've got her kid, Travis.

51:21.537 --> 51:24.416
If she wants to see him again...

51:25.624 --> 51:28.093
you'll bring me the card.

51:28.210 --> 51:29.553
That's all I want.

51:29.628 --> 51:31.255
Come on, you know
how this works.

51:31.380 --> 51:34.008
You know what's on
that deposition, hmm?

51:34.091 --> 51:36.435
Just tell her to bring it in.

51:36.552 --> 51:38.179
You're a real charmer, pal.

51:38.262 --> 51:42.563
You got any more secrets
for me, old friend?

52:04.455 --> 52:05.957
Red Mountain...

52:06.081 --> 52:08.584
they've taken Christopher...

52:09.126 --> 52:11.345
in exchange for the deposition.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.641
Lin.

52:18.761 --> 52:19.978
Christopher.

52:20.095 --> 52:21.893
Listen to me.

52:21.972 --> 52:25.693
I'm going to help you
get your son back.

52:25.809 --> 52:28.187
I promise.

52:29.605 --> 52:31.482
I promise.

52:35.611 --> 52:38.410
You know, he's already
on their jet flying here.

52:38.489 --> 52:42.619
They're going to bring him
to their corporate headquarters.

52:42.743 --> 52:45.587
Okay, I know the route
their escort vehicle takes,

52:45.704 --> 52:47.877
so we'll hit them before
they ever get downtown.

52:47.998 --> 52:49.921
How do you know so much?

52:50.000 --> 52:52.799
I know all their
abduction protocols.

52:52.878 --> 52:54.004
How?

52:54.129 --> 52:57.303
Because I've used them.

53:22.366 --> 53:24.539
Adam?

53:26.870 --> 53:29.214
Come with me, Dad.

53:29.748 --> 53:32.001
Come with me, Dad.

53:38.674 --> 53:39.675
I miss you, Daddy.

53:39.758 --> 53:41.305
I miss you too, buddy.

53:41.385 --> 53:42.762
Are you going to stay this time?

53:42.886 --> 53:44.433
Roscoe, Mike, let's go.

53:44.555 --> 53:45.807
- Jones! Conrad!
- I promise.

53:45.889 --> 53:47.607
I'll be back to
stay this time, I promise.

53:47.725 --> 53:49.193
All right? Listen, I got to go.

53:49.268 --> 53:50.895
Do you think you can put
Mommy on the phone?

53:51.019 --> 53:53.772
You can't keep
doing that, Travis-.

53:53.897 --> 53:55.524
Making promises you don't keep.

53:55.607 --> 53:57.575
I'm making more
money this week...

53:57.693 --> 54:01.914
We don't need the money.
We need you.

54:02.030 --> 54:05.534
Now you're not home
because of this company.

54:05.617 --> 54:07.540
Kate, please, I can't keep
having this conversation.

54:07.619 --> 54:10.168
- All right? Please?
- Travis, let's go!

54:10.247 --> 54:11.624
Travis!

54:33.937 --> 54:35.905
Fuck.

54:36.440 --> 54:38.283
Let's go.

54:38.776 --> 54:40.995
What's happening?

54:41.278 --> 54:45.158
I'm fine. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

54:55.334 --> 54:56.631
Where are you going?

54:56.752 --> 54:59.801
You don't want
to open that door.

55:28.492 --> 55:32.463
You know, I know the team
that's bringing in your son.

55:32.538 --> 55:33.960
They're very good.

55:34.039 --> 55:37.794
We're going to have
to get creative.

55:49.054 --> 55:51.477
Your wife and son?

55:55.519 --> 55:57.021
Yes.

56:13.161 --> 56:17.758
All right, I've got
somebody we need to go see.

56:41.773 --> 56:46.074
Travis Conrad. At
4:00 in the morning.

56:46.194 --> 56:48.071
What can I say?
I missed you, pal.

56:49.197 --> 56:51.291
Yeah, I wish I could
say the same.

56:51.408 --> 56:53.706
Who's your friend?

56:53.785 --> 56:57.335
Amahle, Lin.
Lin, Amahle.

56:57.414 --> 57:00.418
We met in '94,
back in happier times.

57:00.542 --> 57:03.261
Yes, when we were
both real soldiers.

57:03.378 --> 57:05.551
You know, we call
him Travis the Cat,

57:05.714 --> 57:08.763
because he has nine lives,
he always lands on his feet,

57:08.884 --> 57:11.012
and licks his balls.

57:17.309 --> 57:23.066
And now this stray has
wandered into my home

57:23.148 --> 57:25.571
at this time.

57:26.401 --> 57:27.698
For what?

57:31.365 --> 57:34.414
What do you know
about Red Mountain?

57:34.826 --> 57:36.999
They provide a lot
of assistance here.

57:37.120 --> 57:41.091
Money for sanitation,
training, youth programming.

57:41.166 --> 57:42.839
Over the past two years,

57:42.960 --> 57:45.429
hundreds of refugees
have gone missing.

57:46.672 --> 57:48.140
My sister, please.

57:48.256 --> 57:50.554
Tell me something I don't know.

57:50.634 --> 57:53.228
They were abducted and
murdered by Red Mountain.

57:53.345 --> 57:55.689
Used for experimental
medical procedures.

57:55.806 --> 57:57.729
Real Mengele-type shit,
you know?

57:57.808 --> 58:00.982
Human beings used as lab rats.

58:02.354 --> 58:06.404
You know there are a lot
of people in this township,

58:06.483 --> 58:08.235
people that work for me,

58:08.318 --> 58:11.663
whose families
have gone missing.

58:18.370 --> 58:21.920
Come, let's go for a drive.

58:28.839 --> 58:31.137
You're late. Call it in.

58:31.216 --> 58:34.390
All right, the rest
of you, let's hustle.

58:36.638 --> 58:38.265
Base, this is Retrieval
team leader.

58:38.348 --> 58:41.898
We're en route on November
two, approaching Mews Way.

58:42.019 --> 58:46.900
We've got what looks like
a car fire on the main road.

58:46.982 --> 58:48.199
Requesting permission
to reroute.

58:48.316 --> 58:50.159
Permission granted.

58:50.235 --> 58:53.455
Just get your passenger
f0 base ASAP.

58:53.530 --> 58:56.579
Units 2 and 3, we're taking
a detour around this mess.

59:41.953 --> 59:44.206
Is that Travis Conrad?

59:44.289 --> 59:45.211
Fuck, man.

59:45.290 --> 59:49.591
Units 2 and 3, dismount,
but let me handle this.

59:55.425 --> 59:57.553
Hey, man,
what's your name again?

59:57.636 --> 59:58.762
You can call me Z.

59:58.887 --> 01:00:01.106
That's right, Z.
How are you?

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:01.940
Can't complain, Travis.

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:05.357
- How are you?
- I've been better.

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:08.606
I got $318,000 in this bag
here I'd like to give you

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.073
in exchange for your passenger.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.741
Well, that's a very
generous offer,

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:14.161
but you know I can't
do that, right?

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:16.871
Yeah? It's worth
your life to you?

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.415
What you going to do?

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:21.619
I got you outgunned 12 to 1.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.340
You see all these people?

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:38.469
These are the families
and the friends

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:43.224
of those villagers who you
guys somehow made disappear.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.979
Hey, I had nothing
to do with that shit.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:46.401
Yeah, well, I don't
think they give a fuck.

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.194
Well, maybe you do give
a fuck, all right?

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.689
You don't remember me,
but I served under you.

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:51.906
Musizi Bridge, Congo.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.199
I know how you roll, man.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.284
It doesn't have to
go down like that.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.577
What's your name again?

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.030
- Z.
- No, your real name.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.623
- What's your name?
- Zack.

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:01.041
All right, Zachary,
listen to me.

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:05.459
I wasted my whole life
learning how to hurt people.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.497
I kill people for money,
just like you.

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:09.340
And you know what it got me?

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:10.674
Nothing.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:13.671
It took my wife, it took my son.

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:16.048
It took everything,
you understand?

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.471
So I got a lot of work to do...

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:20.894
before I forgive myself,
all right?

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:22.979
So I'm leaving here
with that boy.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:25.227
And you can either walk
away with a bag of money,

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:28.852
or I'm going to walk away
over your dead body.

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.908
Christopher!

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:29.379
Christopher!

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.926
Stop!

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:56.065
No!

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:16.669
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:18.386
Shit.
Let's go!

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.010
- He's in the other vehicle.
- How do you know?

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:24.010
Because the passenger never
rides in the rear vehicle.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.637
Never.
It's protocol.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:41.826
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:50.832
Faster!
We can't lose them.

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:52.795
Shit.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:03:59.966
There they are.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:20.023
Just trust me, all right?

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:39.460
- Christopher!
- Mom, is that you?

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:45.223
I can't see.
Take this thing off.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.299
How have you been?

01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:22.252
Oh, I love you so much.

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:24.971
Get out of here.
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:33.350
I can't do this alone, Travis.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.898
Kate, listen to me.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:37.692
I talked to them.
This is the last time.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:41.863
The next time I come
home, it's for good.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.157
I promise.

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:49.412
I promise.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:04.419
We need to get you
to a hospital.

01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:08.473
It's a little late for that.

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:13.394
You saved my son.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:16.394
Well... well, no,
you did that.

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:18.441
Come with us.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:21.986
I still have some work to do.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:24.109
And you need
to get that testimony

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:26.032
to the authorities.

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:30.992
Goodbye.

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.494
Goodbye.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:39.375
Travis.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.419
Zàijiàn, Wolverine.

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:45.799
Zàijiàn, Hulk.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:49.051
Travis.

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:53.761
Is he still alive? Whoa, hey!
That's my ticket downtown.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.345
Okay, guys.

01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:58.644
I hope you know
I know every protocol

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:00.441
for bringing in a passenger.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:01.689
So if you deviate,

01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:03.061
try to expose my position,

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:05.860
I will not hesitate
to eliminate you.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.490
- Okay.
- You got it?

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:08.407
Yes, sir.

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:11.324
So call it in, all right?

01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:12.779
Calm.
Just be calm.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.705
- Just call it in.
- Okay.

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:18.417
Red Mountain base,
this is Retrieval Unit 2.

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:20.037
Inbound with passenger.

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:20.832
Over.

01:07:20.912 --> 01:07:22.585
Retrieval Unit 2,

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:23.922
this is Red Mountain Base.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.007
Please identify.

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:27.836
Whiskey-foxtrot 9-3-4-2.

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:30.384
Confirmed. Your team missed
your last' mile marker check-in.

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:32.303
What's the status
of the passenger?

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:36.558
Passenger is secure.
Approaching east gate now.

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:39.227
Copy that. Proceed.

01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:41.604
All right, you did a great job.

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:42.725
You can relax.

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.898
You know, I just probably
should let you know

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:49.115
that I'm going to be dead
in about 18 minutes.

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:50.779
So the only thing
I give a shit about

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.447
is fucking with these
guys long enough

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.947
to let this woman
and her child live.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:56.493
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:59.076
If you'd like to see tomorrow,

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.249
you just keep making shit work.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.419
You saved my ass back there.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:12.217
Semper fi, buddy.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.810
Is something going on?

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.977
We've been through some
crazy shit, huh, buddy?

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:24.317
Hell, yeah, we have.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:28.029
We've always known the risks.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.151
Right?

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:33.527
The people that we go after...

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.453
can retaliate.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:38.163
Something happen?

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:41.455
Something happen to Jasmin?

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:47.002
No, man.

01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:50.502
Kate and Adam.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:54.840
What?

01:08:57.966 --> 01:08:59.514
They're...

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.513
they're gone.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.649
Man, I'm sorry.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.689
What the fuck?

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:14.447
This is not a kid.

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:19.080
- Please don't shoot me. I'll do whatever you want.
- Sit up. Sit up!

01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:22.832
Excuse me, sir.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.702
There appears to be a disruption

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.170
occurring at the north gate.

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:29.166
Loading closed-circuit
video now.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.841
Put us in full lockdown.

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:36.214
Then tell Mr. Morrow
I'd like to see him.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:38.057
Yes, sir.

01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:41.182
Sir, we have a situation
at the front gate.

01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:43.680
Yeah. I know.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.308
Fucking Conrad.

01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:57.656
Sir?

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:00.325
Explain.

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:02.282
Go home.
Get out of here!

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:05.494
Go home before I change my mind.

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:15.387
All right, Travis.
Now let's get to work.

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:17.847
What are you thinking?

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.679
Patch me through to the gate.

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:22.977
Right away, sir.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.305
Let me talk to him.

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:30.856
Travis, it's me.

01:10:30.935 --> 01:10:32.687
It's over, buddy.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.067
You hear me?

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:34.939
These guys,

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:37.866
they're not like us-

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:40.240
There is no loyalty.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.243
There is no code.

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:46.959
There's only one code
that I live by, Conrad.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:51.252
And that's for people
to do whatever the fuck I say.

01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:54.876
I just ordered a team
to find and kill

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:56.131
your father-in-law.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.969
Give us the memory card.

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.387
That's all we want.

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:03.514
Nobody gets hurt.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:08.770
Oh, Jim, we both know
that's not true.

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:13.736
Patch me through everywhere.

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.279
Right away, sir.

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:16.773
Oh, come on, Frank.
Come on, Frank.

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:18.024
Shit.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:21.111
Move in and
capture the driver of that vehicle.

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:25.331
If he tries to retreat,
resist or advance,

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:26.324
shoot to kill.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:35.167
Oh, shit.

01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:40.179
Looks like we're both fucked.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:43.516
All right, Travis.

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:51.149
The shortest distance between
two points is a straight line.

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:54.231
This one's for you, Frank.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.389
Hold. Go, go, go, go.

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:34.734
Secure the vehicle first.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.029
Make sure he's dead.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.895
One, two, three.

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.364
Cover me.
Left side.

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:24.404
Sir, the vehicle
is inaccessible.

01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:27.119
The stairwell's totally blocked.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.658
Go around.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:31.036
I want a team up here now.

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:32.116
Yes, sir.

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.118
Echo Team on me.
Move.

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.541
Send a strike team to
find the Interpol agent

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:37.747
and that fucking card.

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:40.500
Yes, sir. Right away.

01:13:57.391 --> 01:13:59.769
You got the right place.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.199
And the right time.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.743
♪ Tell me, how do you feel? ♪

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:11.618
♪ Well, now I feel
Pretty good ♪

01:14:13.491 --> 01:14:15.835
♪ Tell me, how do you feel? ♪

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:16.953
Motherfuckers.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:19.251
♪ Well, now / feel
Very good ♪

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:21.298
Strike team, moving out.

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:23.167
Copy that.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:32.431
I want a status report.
On the target right now.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:34.645
Copy that.

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:37.515
Approaching the vehicle now.

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:51.120
What is that?

01:14:57.284 --> 01:14:59.378
- The security gate is down.
- Open it.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:03.500
Sir, s security system
breech has been defected.

01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:06.878
All perimeter gates
are unresponsive.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.471
It's him.

01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:11.891
He's still alive.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:19.015
Sir, there's nobody
in the vehicle.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.685
He's protecting the girl.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.322
He's trying to fuck with us.

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:33.204
Shit. Sir, we got C-4
wired to explode here.

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:35.910
We got another here!

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:59.222
Watch it, watch it,
watch it, watch the lights.

01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:06.403
Secure the room.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:08.735
No one gets in here.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.493
Tech, you copy?

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:19.325
Yes sir. What
can I do for you?

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:20.660
Send the chopper.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:26.000
And get me an outside strike
team on that Interpol bitch.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:29.586
Call me the second you have her.

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.815
Stay frosty, boys.

01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:08.458
What are you doing?

01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:14.138
I'm having a drink.

01:17:20.594 --> 01:17:22.062
You want one?

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:32.024
A million dollars to the
man who kills Conrad.

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:34.571
But only if he
fucking stays dead!

01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:49.627
I am so sorry.

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:53.088
It's okay, Dad.

01:19:53.163 --> 01:19:56.133
You're almost home.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:15.819
Come on out, Travis.

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:53.645
Sir, your transport has arrived.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.588
You don't want to shoot him,

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:28.266
because you think
he's your friend.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:32.222
He had no problem
looking the other way

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:36.897
when I ordered Adam and
Kate to be killed.

01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:59.749
A man with no family
has nothing to lose.

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:19.146
You knew.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.023
He didn't want you to quit.

01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:32.828
He didn't want you to quit.

01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:36.334
You could have saved them.

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:39.797
We could have saved them.

01:22:40.581 --> 01:22:42.424
I was protecting my family.

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:48.301
It was mine or yours.

01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:59.104
Do it.

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:03.779
Shoot me.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.844
I don't want to kill you.

01:23:35.052 --> 01:23:38.477
I want the fish to like me.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:03.915
Sir, we've located the
Interpol agent and her son.

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:08.385
The local strike team is
being patched through now.

01:24:15.592 --> 01:24:17.686
I got eyes on him.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.900
Should I take the shot?

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:26.061
Negative.

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.908
Stand down.

01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:36.705
Let him live.

01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:07.649
Semper fi.

01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:38.509
You know what this is?

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:42.062
This is the moment
where you realize

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:46.062
that the line between
friendship and profession

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:49.065
is not where you thought it was.

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:52.610
Fuck you.

01:26:00.572 --> 01:26:03.792
Drop your weapon!
Drop your fucking weapon!

01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:09.794
Put it down!

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:15.963
Don't do it.

01:27:19.776 --> 01:27:20.652
Hey.

01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:22.830
- Come here.
- Dad, Dad, I caught a fish!

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:25.453
What'd you catch?
Show me what you caught.

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:26.496
I caught a fish.

01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:29.203
Well, show me what it is.

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:30.792
Adam!

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:33.461
Adam, show me what you caught!

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:36.711
Travis, can you hear me?

01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:39.554
Listen to the sound of my voice.

01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:41.097
It's all going to be okay.

01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:45.599
Stop fighting and stay with
the sound of my voice.

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:47.604
Can you hear me?

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.807
You let' me live, remember?
