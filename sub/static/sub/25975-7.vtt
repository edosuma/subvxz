WEBVTT

00:13.630 --> 00:14.790
[Wendy]
How do we reconcﬂe it?

00:17.260 --> 00:20.844
I... I don't know that we see it
as something that has to be reconciled.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.939
I mean... wouldn't you agree, Marty?

00:27.560 --> 00:28.970
[Marty inhales sharply]

00:29.940 --> 00:32.067
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.269
Uh...

00:35.110 --> 00:39.865
The way we see it, we're in the business
of bringing prosperity to this lake...

00:40.580 --> 00:43.788
of helping to turn it into
a year-round tourist destination,

00:43.870 --> 00:45.997
of helping our community thrive.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.412
And isn't that what it means
to be a good neighbor?

00:49.340 --> 00:53.583
Set a good example for our children?
A good person?

00:53.670 --> 00:55.877
[woman] Obviously, the FBI doesn't see
it that way.

00:56.470 --> 01:00.918
Or they wouldn't have raided your home
and brought you in for questioning, Marty.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.143
Well, they didn't bring me in.
I volunteered.

01:07.230 --> 01:09.516
-[Wendy] Cooperated.
-[woman] Under duress.

01:10.150 --> 01:11.185
[Wendy] How do you ﬁgure?

01:11.900 --> 01:14.232
[woman] They clearly thought
you had something to hide,

01:14.320 --> 01:16.561
because they felt the need to come here
in the middle of the night.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.066
[Wendy] Well, it was
early morning, actually.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.276
[woman] When they knew
you'd least expect them.

01:22.740 --> 01:24.822
I'm curious how you explain that.

01:29.670 --> 01:30.659
Marty.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.181
[breathes slowly]

02:07.540 --> 02:08.700
[Cade] The fuck you doing?

02:09.250 --> 02:10.956
It's obvious he ain't coming, Daddy.

02:11.040 --> 02:14.168
Not necessarily.
Henry can be a tad erratic.

02:14.250 --> 02:16.798
Erratic ain't good enough
when you're a parolee, Daddy.

02:17.510 --> 02:19.626
I said quit fucking with that.
You're gonna draw attention to the merch.

02:19.720 --> 02:20.960
If you think someone's watching,

02:21.050 --> 02:23.291
all the _more reason we should be
getting the fuck out of here.

02:23.390 --> 02:26.097
-[car approaching]
-Fuck. Cops. Go!

02:26.180 --> 02:28.478
Shit. Get the fuck out of here! Go!

02:28.560 --> 02:29.595
[Cade] Shit!

02:34.520 --> 02:37.853
Oh, y'all look like ants,
scrambling from a hill I just stepped on.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.567
[laughs]

02:39.650 --> 02:41.151
You were supposed to come by boat.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.196
Well, uh, boat's out of commission.

02:43.910 --> 02:46.231
Besides, little girls need
to learn to be on their toes.

02:46.330 --> 02:49.993
And quarter-wits need to take their advice
and shove it

02:50.080 --> 02:52.241
before what's left of their brains
leaks out.

02:52.330 --> 02:55.037
Stand down, Ruthie.
The man's got money for us.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.463
Crown Vic? _
What, you trying to look like a cop?

03:02.550 --> 03:03.847
I got it at auction.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.711
So, y'all holding out on me?

03:07.810 --> 03:10.631
Or does this just boil down
to a failure of imagination?

03:11.480 --> 03:12.549
It's off-season.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.187
Right. When we build our inventory.

03:15.270 --> 03:18.478
If you got something specific in mind,
spit it out.

03:18.570 --> 03:20.561
All right. I'll give you ten grand

03:20.650 --> 03:24.768
if you can get me a FLIR Thermal Imaging
System in the next 48.

03:25.780 --> 03:28.362
Well, that's like finding a pearl
in pig shit.

03:28.450 --> 03:31.783
Sure. But if the pearl is so easy to find,

03:31.870 --> 03:35.909
_it wouldn't even be worth the shit
It was In, now would It? [laughing]

03:46.510 --> 03:47.670
[Marty] Is everything okay?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.129
Wendy, you all right?

03:54.270 --> 03:56.397
Wilkes thinks you're about to be arrested.

03:58.980 --> 04:00.436
Really? When did he say that?

04:02.200 --> 04:03.565
Couple of days ago.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.104
And you're just now bringing it up?

04:05.820 --> 04:08.368
Well, we've kind of had
our hands full, Marty.

04:08.450 --> 04:10.862
Did he care to share how he came
to this conclusion,

04:10.950 --> 04:13.703
-or did he just kind of blurt it out?
-Does it matter how if he's right?

04:14.540 --> 04:16.781
How many other people have to betray us
before we realize--

04:16.880 --> 04:19.792
Well, Rachel is not betraying us. She's wearing a wire,
after she stole from us.

04:23.590 --> 04:28.038
A wire that she told us about,
after she outed her handler to us.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.131
She could've shown you
because she thought you were onto her,

04:30.220 --> 04:31.460
and she thought it was her best move.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.346
She obviously hasn't given anything
to the FBI on us,

04:33.430 --> 04:34.977
otherwise she wouldn't have
told us about it.

04:35.060 --> 04:36.937
How do you know
she hasn't given them anything?

04:38.110 --> 04:40.317
Do you have any idea how long
she's been wearing that wire?

04:40.400 --> 04:42.106
My guess is since she's been back.

04:42.190 --> 04:43.100
But you don't know for sure.

04:43.190 --> 04:45.067
Just like you don't know
she's not playing us.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.117
Why do I get the feeling
I'm the one being interrogated here?

04:51.200 --> 04:53.998
'Cause I told you she couldn't be trusted,
and you didn't believe me.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.536
[cell phone chimes]

04:58.290 --> 05:00.872
-Was that her? _
-"I need to see you as soon as possmle."

05:00.960 --> 05:02.666
-No.
-Could be important.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.159
None of us can step in the Blue Cat again.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.002
Charlotte, you're no longer working
at the Blue Cat.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.130
-Wait, what?
-I'll explain later.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.216
[Charlotte] You're the one that wanted me
working there.

05:11.310 --> 05:12.550
Well, now we don't.

05:13.470 --> 05:15.381
Go tell your brother,
just because he's suspended,

05:15.480 --> 05:16.845
that doesn't mean he gets
to sleep in all day.

05:16.940 --> 05:18.976
I want him at that table,
doing his homework

05:19.060 --> 05:21.016
and only his homework,
by the time I'm out the door.

05:21.650 --> 05:23.891
Nothing in this house makes
any fucking sense.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.106
I don't think we can avoid
the Blue Cat entirely.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.942
It'll just tip off the FBI
that we're onto her.

05:29.030 --> 05:30.110
What would you rather do?

05:30.200 --> 05:31.690
I'd like to take advantage
of the situation

05:31.780 --> 05:34.032
and feed them misinformation. Excuse me.

05:34.120 --> 05:37.954
That is way too rislq. What if you slip
and tell her something you shouldn't?

05:39.250 --> 05:41.081
I think I'm capable
of a little discretion.

05:43.550 --> 05:45.757
The safest choice is a clean break.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.001
Since when were you one
for taking unnecessary risks?

05:48.090 --> 05:49.796
Please tell the kids
that breakfast is ready.

05:49.890 --> 05:51.676
I gotta go take care
of some business at the club.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.012
Don't forget we have
that PR agent thing at ten.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.931
-Helen had to haul ass--
-Got it.

06:05.230 --> 06:06.891
[Cade] It's just a little water, baby.

06:11.570 --> 06:14.038
And you're sure his boat's got
a FLIR Imaging System?

06:14.700 --> 06:17.863
If he talked about that boat any more,
you'd think he married it.

06:19.210 --> 06:22.202
Lulu said that he just about
moans its name

06:22.290 --> 06:24.167
when she goes down on him
in the parking lot.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.548
It'd be a real shame to squander
all this time

06:26.630 --> 06:29.793
we could be spending on more
remunerative opportunities.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.542
Opportunities with a pay-off
we actually know exists.

06:32.640 --> 06:36.269
I can't steal Marty's money
if I don't know where it is, Daddy.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.056
I'm trying.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.938
-Try harder.
-I said I'm working on it, okay?

06:53.240 --> 06:54.366
[Cade chuckles]

06:55.080 --> 06:58.243
Don't mind ifI do.
We'll come back after dark, Ruthie.

06:59.000 --> 06:59.989
[chuckles]

07:05.000 --> 07:05.910
[Rachel] Hi.

07:06.710 --> 07:08.337
Hi. Everything all right?

07:09.760 --> 07:10.920
[cell phone chimes]

07:15.010 --> 07:17.171
I can't stop thinking about last night.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.300
Yeah, me, too.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.183
I could hardly sleep,
wondering when I'd see you again.

07:27.230 --> 07:28.606
Yeah, that makes two of us.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.527
Turns out I didn't have to wait
very long, dId I?

07:33.610 --> 07:34.736
No, you didn't.

07:36.780 --> 07:37.690
Thank God.

07:42.290 --> 07:44.872
God, I wish we didn't have
customers here right now.

07:48.880 --> 07:49.869
Why's that?

07:51.340 --> 07:53.126
Don't make me say it. I'll blush.

07:53.220 --> 07:54.630
[Marty typing]

07:56.890 --> 07:59.711
Well, I'd, uh... I'd really love to hear
you say it, Rachel,

07:59.810 --> 08:03.598
because, uh, you've piqued my interest,
and I'm a curious guy.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.069
Hmm.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.876
Maybe you could come by around closing,
and I could show you.

08:53.150 --> 08:54.390
Should I wait for you?

09:24.060 --> 09:25.049
[door closes]

09:26.850 --> 09:29.853
Hi, Charlie. Hey, it's me.
It's Wendy. I just...

09:30.440 --> 09:34.274
I don't want you to think that I have
forgotten you or that I'm ignoring you.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.988
I just... I just need some time to,

09:37.700 --> 09:40.112
I don't know, process our conversation.

09:40.200 --> 09:45.786
I just need to think it through,
so if you could just bear with me, okay?

09:45.870 --> 09:48.532
I'll... I'll call you. Thanks, bye.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.241
[grunting]

09:52.340 --> 09:55.127
Looks like you've got
some serious problems.

09:55.590 --> 09:58.718
You're lucky Helen called
while the situation is salvageable.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.849
Albeit with an extremely
aggressive approach.

10:01.930 --> 10:04.137
Or as it's known around here,
40 minutes of hell.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.595
Not sure I follow.

10:06.680 --> 10:10.138
The full-court press,
pioneered by Nolan Richardson

10:10.230 --> 10:12.812
when he led the Razorbacks
to the '94 national title?

10:13.570 --> 10:15.777
-And adopted by Mizzou...
-Right.

10:15.860 --> 10:19.352
...when his longtime assistant
Mike Anderson coached the Tigers? Come on.

10:19.450 --> 10:21.816
[scoffs] I've never even been
to the Ozarks before, and I knew that.

10:21.910 --> 10:22.729
Yeah.

10:24.410 --> 10:27.994
Well, just like Coach Richardson's
famous full-court press,

10:28.080 --> 10:31.413
our strategy is to play offense
and defense with equal intensity.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.042
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.

10:34.130 --> 10:35.370
I'll be posting regularly

10:35.460 --> 10:37.462
-and expecting you all to do the same.
-Mm-hmm.

10:37.550 --> 10:41.134
And tomorrow, a lifestyle reporter
from the
Kansas 00/ Star

10:41.220 --> 10:42.881
will be interviewing you in your home

10:42.970 --> 10:45.052
and doing a photo spread of the family.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.847
You all have such a wholesome look,

10:47.930 --> 10:52.299
and we want to emphasize the casino
as an approachable mom-and-pop operation.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.265
How do you know
what our family looks like?

10:55.190 --> 10:56.020
Helen.

10:57.940 --> 11:00.659
Yeah. Um...

11:02.200 --> 11:04.828
Tell me about the defensive part
of our full-court press.

11:04.910 --> 11:07.117
[woman] The problem
with the US justice system is

11:07.200 --> 11:09.782
it doesn't prove innocence,
even if you're acquitted.

11:09.870 --> 11:14.705
So, it's up to us to wash the stink off by
hitting your little FBI problem head-on.

11:14.790 --> 11:17.623
So you're going to look gracious
about the investigation.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.792
Smile it off as a misunderstanding.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.714
I'm supposed to smile about the FBI
threatening to put my kids in prison?

11:24.140 --> 11:26.961
Do you want to act righteous, Marty,
or do you wanna win?

11:27.560 --> 11:30.131
I work with winners.
I bet your wife does, too.

11:30.230 --> 11:31.595
And she'd know the right answer

11:31.690 --> 11:34.181
-from her work in politics.
-Hmm. [chuckles]

11:34.270 --> 11:37.103
Speaking of which,
when are we expecting Wendy?

11:38.860 --> 11:40.646
-[man] Get up!
-[Wendy grunting]

11:40.740 --> 11:44.369
I have a 14-year-old boy named Jonah
and a 15-year-old girl named Charlotte.

11:46.370 --> 11:49.658
The boy, he's really, really smart.
He's a little awkward, but, you know,

11:49.750 --> 11:51.240
I bet if you gave him a jet engine,

11:51.330 --> 11:53.707
he could take it apart,
and he could put it back together again.

11:53.790 --> 11:56.873
And the 15-year-old,
she doesn't apply herself as much,

11:56.960 --> 11:59.417
but nothing gets by her, believe me. No!

12:00.420 --> 12:02.422
No. [panting]

12:03.680 --> 12:04.829
-[Wendy shouts]
-[trunk slams]

12:05.850 --> 12:08.466
HI} this is Wendy. Lea ve me a message.
[beeps]

13:06.860 --> 13:07.861
Wendy!

13:14.500 --> 13:15.649
Wendy!

13:17.710 --> 13:21.248
[man] Shall not go unpunished.
Can't go unpunished.

13:25.670 --> 13:29.788
Until the lies will be destroyed.
Must be destroyed.

13:34.310 --> 13:35.129
Hey.

13:35.810 --> 13:36.765
Where is she?

13:37.440 --> 13:39.226
I haven't the faintest clue
what you're talking about.

13:39.900 --> 13:40.889
Wendy.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.811
I just found her car out
in the middle of fucking nowhere,

13:43.900 --> 13:45.185
with tire tracks leading away from it.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.566
The same exact stunt you and Jacob
pulled on me a few months ago.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.481
Now, why would we go and do
a thing like that to Wendy?

13:51.160 --> 13:52.229
Cut the shit.

13:52.330 --> 13:55.652
We don't sell fertilizer, Byrde.
That's two rows down.

14:00.250 --> 14:01.831
We both know
that you're still pissed off at her

14:01.920 --> 14:05.048
for burning the field
and lying to you about getting a kid.

14:05.130 --> 14:07.507
Sounds like maybe she deserved
to be taken.

14:08.090 --> 14:11.548
Darlene, I'm gonna give you two minutes
to decide whether you wanna start a war

14:11.640 --> 14:14.177
that you have zero chance of winning.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.464
Or maybe she left you.

14:16.270 --> 14:18.636
Oh, she's a devious one, that Wendy.

14:18.730 --> 14:21.107
Tell me where Jacob is, okay?
Maybe I'll talk to the sane one.

14:21.190 --> 14:24.068
Jacob had other urgent business
to attend to.

14:24.150 --> 14:26.277
Something to do with cleaning up the mess

14:26.360 --> 14:28.817
you and your treacherous wife made
on our property.

14:28.900 --> 14:32.654
That fire in your fields is gonna be
the least of your fucking problems

14:32.740 --> 14:34.617
unless you return my wife
to me immediately--

14:34.700 --> 14:37.578
I can't return what I don't have.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.746
[thudding]

14:43.840 --> 14:46.081
[door opens]

15:05.650 --> 15:06.935
-Mason--
-Shut up.

15:08.190 --> 15:10.693
Before you say a word,
you need to know how this works.

15:11.070 --> 15:15.518
Whatever happens down here, you control.
The more you lie, the messier it gets.

15:15.620 --> 15:18.248
But if all you do is tell me
the unadulterated truth,

15:18.660 --> 15:19.490
this'll be painless.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.992
-I heard you praying out there,
-I think you should tell the truth.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.128
-Maybe you should stop lying.
-trying to summon the strength to do this.

15:24.210 --> 15:27.452
-For once!
-We both know this is not who you are.

15:27.550 --> 15:30.371
-Oh, really?
-No. Mason!

15:30.970 --> 15:33.177
You're a good man.

15:33.260 --> 15:35.342
[stammers] You're genuine.
You're selfless.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.637
You're the farthest thing
from a killer there is!

15:37.720 --> 15:39.301
Lucifer was an angel before he fell.

15:39.390 --> 15:42.018
He was pristine, he was blameless,
and then one day, he wasn't.

15:42.100 --> 15:45.888
Lucifer wasn't a father.
He didn't have a little boy to lose.

15:45.980 --> 15:48.107
Neither do I!

15:49.030 --> 15:51.692
[stammers] What are you...
What are you talking about?

15:51.780 --> 15:53.190
What, did something happen to your son?

15:53.280 --> 15:55.521
-Don't. Don't, don't.
-No, what? Did somebody hurt him?

15:55.620 --> 15:57.235
Mason! Mason, you tell me what's going on!

15:57.330 --> 15:59.992
You know what's going on!
You're the one that did it!

16:00.080 --> 16:01.991
-What do you mean?
-And now you got the guts to lie to me,

16:02.080 --> 16:04.878
-when I can take your fucking face off?
-I'm not lying. You threatened me. You told me not
to take my son to the police,

16:07.840 --> 16:10.001
then you had him taken from his father!

16:10.090 --> 16:12.376
-I don't know anything about this. Mason!
-Oh, God!

16:12.470 --> 16:16.429
"A false witness will not go unpunished,
and a liar will be destroyed."

16:16.510 --> 16:17.807
Mason.

16:17.890 --> 16:21.269
"A false witness will not go unpunished,
and a liar will be destroyed."

16:21.350 --> 16:24.183
Mason, I don't have anything to gain
from taking your son!

16:24.270 --> 16:25.646
But I can get him back.

16:26.610 --> 16:30.182
But I have to be alive.
We can turn this around.

16:30.860 --> 16:33.397
But the second I die, it's over.

16:33.820 --> 16:35.651
Let me help you get your son.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.201
[cell phone ringing]

16:47.630 --> 16:50.121
-Hello.
-Marty, It’s Mason.

16:53.420 --> 16:54.421
Mason? I have Wendy.

16:58.430 --> 17:00.557
She says that you can get
Zeke back for me.

17:01.970 --> 17:05.599
The police took my son,
and I want him back.

17:06.690 --> 17:08.681
Before sunrise tomorrow or Wendy o'ies.

17:09.150 --> 17:14.235
If you call the cops
or the cartel or the Snells, Wendy dies.

17:14.320 --> 17:18.063
If anyone other than you and my son
show up tomorrow morning,

17:18.620 --> 17:20.861
Wendy is dead Are we clear?

17:20.950 --> 17:24.158
Let me talk to Wendy. I'm not doing
anything until I know she's all right.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.168
-[stammers] I'm here, Marty. I'm fine.
-Where? Where’s ”here”?

17:32.250 --> 17:34.627
-Where are you?
-] don’t/(now.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.039
Try to find out.

17:36.130 --> 17:38.178
It doesn't matter unless you have Zeke.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.210
Call Wilkes. He'll help you.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.256
He knows people
in almost every state agency

17:42.350 --> 17:45.228
Wendy, hang on. This is crazy.
I can't get that kid in a day.

17:45.310 --> 17:46.470
[line disconnects]

17:47.190 --> 17:48.088
Wendy. Hello.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.191
[screaming in distance]

18:13.420 --> 18:14.409
[sniffles]

18:17.170 --> 18:18.125
[faucet running]

18:30.810 --> 18:32.391
[knock on door]

18:32.980 --> 18:34.777
[Ruth clears throat] One second.

18:36.820 --> 18:37.684
What do you want?

18:38.240 --> 18:40.856
I think Wyatt ought to be the one
who comes with me tonight.

18:40.950 --> 18:44.192
Why? You want him to go from dropout
to juvie in 24 hours?

18:44.280 --> 18:45.190
Now, Ruthie, that's not--

18:45.290 --> 18:47.497
What? How about we get him
a drug charge while we're at it?

18:47.580 --> 18:49.536
Make sure he hits
for the delinquency cycle.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.531
He ain't gonna get caught.

18:51.630 --> 18:52.619
'Cause he ain't going.

18:54.090 --> 18:57.048
There's no need for you
to be taking a risk like this, Ruthie.

18:59.420 --> 19:02.082
Risk? What risk?

19:02.180 --> 19:04.967
You ain't been right since that night
with the cartel.

19:07.470 --> 19:10.633
Just worry about yourself.
I'm fucking fine.

19:27.410 --> 19:28.399
[sighs]

19:38.960 --> 19:40.006
[sighs]

19:42.680 --> 19:43.499
Hey.

19:44.390 --> 19:47.632
You know what these are?
Email exchanges with my PAC board,
trying to convince them not to resign
'cause of your FBI shitstorm, okay?

19:51.060 --> 19:52.470
-We||, sorry about that.
-So, whatever emergency

19:52.560 --> 19:54.721
you couldn't tell Jim about on the phone
better not be bullshit...

19:54.810 --> 19:55.936
-We||, listen--
-...'cause you're interrupting

19:56.020 --> 19:59.399
-some very important things, and--
-Wendy has been kidnapped, okay?

20:00.030 --> 20:00.849
Kidnapped?

20:00.940 --> 20:02.988
That's right. Yeah, her life's in danger.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.368
-And I need you to do something for me.
-Okay. Okay, okay.

20:05.450 --> 20:07.577
-Um... there's a...
-Call the FBI...

20:07.660 --> 20:09.196
-No. You can't call the FBI.
-You know what?

20:09.290 --> 20:11.702
-You'd get her killed. We both know that.
-I have friends whose security firms

20:11.790 --> 20:14.577
-specialize in this sort of thing.
-No, no. Hey. No security, no feds.

20:14.670 --> 20:16.160
-It's gotta be done bloodless. Listen--
-Oh, come on.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.957
As long as Wendy's okay,
why do you care how it ends?

20:19.050 --> 20:20.335
Because I do. _
It's gotta be done bloodless, and there's just one way to do that.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.677
And this is gonna sound
a little bit crazy... Yeah? Crazier than everything else
that's happening here?

20:25.720 --> 20:30.805
[sighs] I need you to get me this baby
from Social Services today.

20:32.310 --> 20:33.937
-Crazy. Yeah.
-Yeah. Well...

20:34.730 --> 20:36.220
That's flat fucking insane.

20:55.290 --> 20:57.030
So you know I'm not a monster.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.081
I'd never think that, Mason.

21:04.510 --> 21:08.594
I think you're confused... and lost.

21:11.100 --> 21:14.263
But that's only natural
when you've been lied to so many times.

21:26.530 --> 21:29.192
Grace was one of the bodies
they found at the Snells.

21:37.370 --> 21:39.281
-The police said--
-The police lied.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.909
We told them to.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.882
When I told everybody that I wasn't...

21:53.100 --> 21:56.479
crazy, that... that I knew Grace,
that I knew that she wouldn't just leave--

21:56.560 --> 21:58.391
Yeah, you were right, Mason.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.897
Grace was murdered,
and we helped cover it up.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.791
[exhales]

22:27.470 --> 22:28.459
Um...

22:29.680 --> 22:30.920
Do you, um... know where she is?

22:34.850 --> 22:36.010
I Wish I did.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.898
All Marty and I did was give them bones
to put in her place

22:41.980 --> 22:43.857
and threaten the medical examiner.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.022
[sighs] Like you threatened me.

22:49.650 --> 22:51.106
[panﬁng]

22:53.280 --> 22:56.829
That was a warning. That was not a threat.

22:58.750 --> 23:01.628
That was me trying to protect you,

23:01.710 --> 23:04.281
because I know too well
what the Snells are capable of.

23:05.710 --> 23:07.041
'Cause you work with them.

23:08.260 --> 23:09.750
Not because we want to.

23:11.840 --> 23:12.920
Because...

23:14.300 --> 23:15.301
uh...

23:18.060 --> 23:19.470
we felt we had to.

23:20.940 --> 23:23.261
Convinced ourselves it was the only way.

23:24.900 --> 23:25.935
[scoffs]

23:27.190 --> 23:29.351
That's the thing that no one tells you
about evil.

23:32.450 --> 23:37.114
They make it seem like
there are two clearly marked paths

23:38.250 --> 23:43.779
with flashing signs pointing out
each way: sin, redemption.

23:45.380 --> 23:48.122
I mean, they tell you Adam and Eve
knew that they could eat

23:48.210 --> 23:51.964
from every single tree
in that garden, except one.

23:53.430 --> 23:54.886
But the truth is,

23:55.600 --> 23:59.388
evil comes when the righteous path
is so hidden...

24:02.140 --> 24:04.597
it just looks like there's only
one way out.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.311
The truth is Adam and Eve
probably grabbed that apple

24:12.400 --> 24:15.619
because they were fucking starving,
and it was the first tree they saw.

24:17.030 --> 24:18.691
Not that that's any excuse.

24:19.950 --> 24:23.204
Or that I ever deserve your forgiveness.
I just...

24:25.330 --> 24:27.582
I don't want you to make the same mistake.

24:28.590 --> 24:30.797
I don't want you to do
something you regret

24:31.340 --> 24:33.467
because you think there's only one way.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.841
There is another path for you.

24:40.310 --> 24:41.971
It's a better path.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.090
I can help you find it.

24:48.190 --> 24:50.852
You have no idea what I would have done

24:50.940 --> 24:53.272
if someone had come along
and done that for me.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.405
Find it how?

24:59.490 --> 25:00.787
What do you need?

25:02.660 --> 25:05.868
Clothes for Zeke? Formula?
I can get you money.

25:08.170 --> 25:11.583
Do you wanna move? Wipe the slate clean?

25:13.590 --> 25:17.708
Point to a map, anywhere on a map.
I can get you an apartment.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.132
I can even put down a security deposit.

25:20.220 --> 25:22.711
By the time Zeke is back in your arms,

25:24.020 --> 25:27.512
your new life can be ready,
waiting for you to walk into it.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.022
But first, I really need to pee.

25:38.320 --> 25:39.696
[chuckles softly]

26:10.560 --> 26:12.107
I need my hands to...

26:19.860 --> 26:20.690
Thank you.

26:26.660 --> 26:28.787
Really think I'm gonna try and squeeze
through the window?

27:26.470 --> 27:27.846
Gilroy's gonna wonder.

27:28.680 --> 27:32.343
Legitimate businessmen don't need babies
at a moment's notice.

27:32.440 --> 27:33.646
But you know what?

27:35.730 --> 27:38.062
Let me be very clear, okay?

27:39.150 --> 27:41.903
I'm gonna get this done for you,
for Wendy.

27:42.610 --> 27:48.571
But the second this little circus ends,
our relationship ceases to exist.

27:54.380 --> 27:55.449
[toilet flushing]

28:33.040 --> 28:34.246
[sighs]

28:39.420 --> 28:42.719
You know, Marty and his wife Wendy
are upstanding members of the community.

28:42.800 --> 28:47.885
They're business owners.
They're parents. They're Christians.

28:48.810 --> 28:49.754
You know?

28:49.850 --> 28:53.434
They're close friends of Mason Young,
former members of his congregation.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.431
They were donating money
to help him build a church.

28:55.520 --> 29:00.059
They started a GoFundMe page
when the pastor fell on hard times.

29:00.150 --> 29:02.983
So, I think we can all agree this is a...

29:03.860 --> 29:06.863
this is an ideal situation for Ezekiel,

29:07.450 --> 29:10.738
fostered by a friendly family
who shares Mason's values.

29:11.700 --> 29:14.749
You, uh, interested in fostering
other children, Mr. Byrde?

29:15.750 --> 29:17.570
Oh, uh...

29:18.130 --> 29:22.829
[stammers] This is
a real special circumstance.

29:22.920 --> 29:25.718
[Gilroy] You see,
I'm working my tail off here

29:25.800 --> 29:29.292
to try and get my department's priorities
back on track, but, uh...

29:29.970 --> 29:33.212
I'm having the hardest time finding
foster families that can help me do that.

29:33.770 --> 29:36.307
Foster families who promote
the sort of values

29:36.390 --> 29:41.009
that can combat the moral decay
that our society is experiencing.

29:41.230 --> 29:43.278
Yeah. Amen. Well, listen.
I'll tell you what.

29:43.360 --> 29:47.945
This situation has really awakened in me
and my wife, uh,

29:48.030 --> 29:52.729
the deep need that's out there
for that, uh, crisis, really. And, uh--

29:52.830 --> 29:54.070
[Gilroy chuckles] I'm glad to hear that.

29:54.160 --> 29:58.324
Yeah. So let me broach that subject
with my wife, please,

29:58.420 --> 30:01.492
you know, right after
we get this situation underway.

30:01.590 --> 30:03.239
You'll broach it with her,

30:03.340 --> 30:06.798
and I'll see that this little situation
gets resolved right away.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.507
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate that.

30:08.590 --> 30:10.342
You'll be receiving a call saying

30:10.430 --> 30:14.264
Ezekiel's ready to be picked up
in about, uh, ten days.

30:17.690 --> 30:21.399
Ten days? Uh... Uh, Mr. Gilroy...

30:22.610 --> 30:23.599
Uh...

30:25.360 --> 30:27.942
You know, I think that it is vital

30:28.570 --> 30:33.610
that Ezekiel spends as little time
as possible in the system,

30:33.700 --> 30:38.820
to minimize the exposure to that
moral decay that you were talking about.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.287
-He's barely been in the system 48 hours.
-That's 48 hours too many.

30:44.050 --> 30:44.869
So you're saying--

30:44.960 --> 30:49.215
We were hoping to have custody
of Ezekiel tonight.

30:50.640 --> 30:57.387
It would be an understatement to say
that this request is highly unusual.

30:58.020 --> 31:00.807
I understand that, yeah, but, uh...

31:01.560 --> 31:02.390
[sighs]

31:03.820 --> 31:07.813
Mason Young has lost
a tremendous amount in three months.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.949
He's had his church burned to the ground,
his wife has abandoned him,

31:11.030 --> 31:15.444
and now his son Ezekiel, without
any warning, without any explanation.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.243
And we're concerned that... that, uh...

31:20.370 --> 31:25.455
that Mason might not be able to handle
a loss like this.

31:25.550 --> 31:31.500
And so, you know,
I'm asking for your help as a fellow man,

31:31.590 --> 31:36.345
a fellow Christian,
to help steady this man's soul, uh...

31:36.430 --> 31:43.393
by placing his son, his only anchor,
in a home that he knows, that he trusts.

31:45.730 --> 31:46.890
Right away.

31:58.620 --> 32:00.030
You want some tea?

32:05.420 --> 32:08.492
My grandmama believed there was nothing
that couldn't be made better...

32:09.550 --> 32:10.665
by a cup of tea.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.265
[inhales] I killed her.

32:27.820 --> 32:31.438
[sniffles] She warned me, you know?
Told me to stop being so stubborn,

32:32.610 --> 32:35.317
go back to the water. [chuckles]

32:35.410 --> 32:36.399
[sniffles]

32:37.660 --> 32:41.448
And be thankful for what we had, but...

32:44.670 --> 32:45.568
I didn't listen.

32:51.630 --> 32:52.915
I killed her.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.848
Mason. Mason, look at me.

33:05.940 --> 33:11.435
There's a sweetness in surrendering
right now, because it's easy.

33:13.070 --> 33:14.480
Because no one would blame you for it.

33:14.570 --> 33:16.561
Because, hell,
I wouldn't blame you for it.

33:17.450 --> 33:19.156
But that guilt you're feeling...

33:20.080 --> 33:22.241
it's the Devil tempting you.

33:23.290 --> 33:25.417
Because there's a little boy out there,

33:26.960 --> 33:29.918
and he needs you
more than anything in the world.

33:31.840 --> 33:32.909
And that guilt.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.546
It does nothing for him.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.302
My sin was pride.

33:44.350 --> 33:46.727
[sniffles] You came to us...

33:49.190 --> 33:54.435
and I knew you weren't believers.
I knew that you were lying.

33:59.780 --> 34:02.829
And I still thought I could change you.
[laughing]

34:06.580 --> 34:09.071
I still thought I could turn you
into something that you weren't.

34:12.500 --> 34:13.910
Maybe you still can.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.580
[kettle whistling]

34:23.890 --> 34:25.596
Why the fuck hasn't Marty called?

34:30.560 --> 34:31.549
[Mason grunts]

34:32.690 --> 34:35.272
[grunts, yells]

34:35.360 --> 34:36.600
[groans]

34:41.070 --> 34:42.526
[Wendy] Help!

34:43.990 --> 34:47.448
[yelling, grunting]

34:49.290 --> 34:52.282
Help! Stop! Stop it!

34:52.380 --> 34:54.200
Stop! No, stop!

35:00.090 --> 35:02.968
-[Wendy screaming]
-Shh.

35:13.310 --> 35:14.857
[Wendy] No, please!

35:14.940 --> 35:17.067
[screaming continues]

35:18.360 --> 35:19.315
Please, stop!

35:25.910 --> 35:29.619
[Mason] You know, I should really just
thank you for making this easier on me.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.917
-Please, please, please, please--
-Shut up!

35:34.090 --> 35:36.081
[cell phone ringing]

35:40.550 --> 35:43.383
[breathing heavily] Yeah?

35:43.470 --> 35:45.961
Mason, it's Marty. I've got Zeke.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.846
They just gave him to me.
Let me show him to you.

35:48.520 --> 35:51.808
Hey, say hello to your dad.
Say hello to your dad, huh?

35:51.890 --> 35:54.518
Say hello, little guy. Can you smile?
Can you smile for your daddy?

35:54.610 --> 35:56.817
-There it is. There it is.
-[laughing]

35:59.530 --> 36:01.987
Um, okay. Um, bring him here.

36:02.070 --> 36:04.368
Uh, let me see Wendy.

36:08.490 --> 36:10.617
Okay. Okay.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.530
[Mason]
Happy? Bring him here.

36:13.210 --> 36:14.325
Uh, where's "here"?

36:14.420 --> 36:18.049
[Mason]
Home. I’m at my home.
Pu// around to the side of the house.

36:18.130 --> 36:21.964
And you come alone, and you come unarmed,
or Wendy dies.

36:34.190 --> 36:37.057
[Cade laughs] There she is.

36:41.570 --> 36:42.946
She's a beauty, ain't she?

36:44.860 --> 36:46.487
Well, let's get to it.

36:51.370 --> 36:53.952
[Wendy] Everything I said before was true.
I need you to know that.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.912
Just because of what happened,
it doesn't mean I was lying to you.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.877
I want what is best for you.

37:03.170 --> 37:06.389
I want this to work out for you.
I want you and Zeke to be together.

37:09.180 --> 37:10.920
So you attack me after I cut you loose?

37:11.020 --> 37:12.669
Well, it's instinct, Mason.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.970
I'm scared to death.

37:23.150 --> 37:26.699
When you think you're going down,
you grab hold of whatever's closest.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.526
Guns, drugs.

37:30.870 --> 37:31.689
God.

37:33.700 --> 37:34.655
Fire extinguisher.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.991
You've never grabbed a hold of God
once in your life.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.587
You have no idea who I am.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.328
[scoffs]

37:49.930 --> 37:51.670
I grabbed hold of God.

38:01.270 --> 38:03.932
Where I grew up,
self-annihilation was a religion.

38:05.030 --> 38:07.601
More followers than Christianity's.
More passionate, too.

38:12.410 --> 38:13.900
Sex, booze, drugs.

38:16.120 --> 38:20.284
All before I was 15.
I was a quick convert.

38:26.260 --> 38:30.003
And the one place that kept me from going
under was that church I told you about.

38:30.760 --> 38:33.137
The one that my daddy built
with his bare hands.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.380
And when going home wasn't an option,

38:36.480 --> 38:38.766
because that very same daddy
decided he loved liquor

38:38.850 --> 38:43.184
just a little bit more than
he loved Jesus that night? [clicks tongue]

38:44.730 --> 38:46.732
[breathing heavily]

38:48.700 --> 38:49.769
I went to church.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.657
Even though I was a sinner,
I knew I needed it.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.570
And I felt safe there.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.786
Then when I turned about...

39:03.960 --> 39:05.916
seventeen, I realized where I was headed.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.410
I'd put one too many friends
into an early grave,

39:08.510 --> 39:10.375
and it scared the shit out of me.

39:13.510 --> 39:15.000
So I went to my pastor,

39:17.060 --> 39:21.178
and I threw myself into the loving arms
of his mercy, looking for salvation.

39:22.690 --> 39:24.510
Or at least a little hope.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.850
I told him everything.

39:26.940 --> 39:31.149
I believed his forgiveness
would make me whole.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.942
I even told him about the abortions.
[chuckles softly]

39:36.040 --> 39:37.689
And he said all the right things.

39:38.660 --> 39:42.994
How lonely I must've felt,
how we all stray from the path,

39:43.710 --> 39:47.168
how the important thing was
that I was walking it again.

39:51.880 --> 39:54.132
But the way his jaw tightened,

39:58.180 --> 40:02.640
the way his eyes hardened
when he looked at me, I knew.

40:05.110 --> 40:07.647
I knew he'd never look at me
the same way again.

40:08.860 --> 40:11.693
[scoffs] And I was devastated.

40:13.490 --> 40:15.560
I was heartbroken, and I wasn't welcome.

40:18.740 --> 40:20.401
So I left God behind.

40:22.210 --> 40:25.122
Because you wanted to leave him behind.

40:26.880 --> 40:29.758
Because you never truly believed, right?

40:29.840 --> 40:31.876
A Southern preacher and abortions?

40:31.970 --> 40:33.870
You knew exactly how he'd react.

40:35.050 --> 40:36.256
That's why you told him.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.301
How long after did you leave home?

40:40.430 --> 40:41.340
Six months.

40:41.430 --> 40:42.931
Okay. So you said it yourself.

40:43.020 --> 40:45.056
The church was the only thing
that you had left.

40:45.150 --> 40:46.765
So you needed him to reject you,

40:46.860 --> 40:48.646
so that way you had no choice
but to leave.

40:48.730 --> 40:51.813
But anyone who truly believes
can't just walk away like that.

40:55.280 --> 40:58.408
Anyone who truly believes can't just
turn their back on their faith,

40:58.490 --> 40:59.787
not even for survival.

41:00.540 --> 41:01.359
[sniffs]

41:02.620 --> 41:04.997
You leave a church, fine.
You leave a pastor, fine.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.240
But you find a new one.

41:06.830 --> 41:09.879
Because anyone who believes
knows that faith isn't a choice.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.700
It's the essence of life.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.255
Do you understand?

41:16.220 --> 41:20.213
When I walked into that robbery,
I was just as desperate as you were.

41:20.310 --> 41:24.758
I had no job. I had no family,
no direction, no reason to live.

41:25.270 --> 41:31.561
But I walked into that store
'cause I knew that God would protect me.

41:32.900 --> 41:35.482
When I was lost,
I didn't walk away from him.

41:37.030 --> 41:38.236
I walked towards him.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.537
Oh, Mason... [scoffs]

41:47.920 --> 41:49.990
You didn't walk into that store
to find God. You walked into that store to die.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.883
God was just something
you happened to find along the way.

42:04.520 --> 42:07.899
[grunting]

42:14.240 --> 42:18.108
[Cade] Come on, don't you tease me now,
not when I'm about this close.

42:20.570 --> 42:23.403
[whispering] God damn it, Ruth, I said
keep that goddamn light on my hands.

42:25.080 --> 42:26.991
-[grunts]
-[Ruth] Fuck. Shit.

42:27.750 --> 42:29.877
-[Ruth] Fuck.
-Kill the light.

42:29.960 --> 42:32.702
[man] Hey! Is somebody down there?

42:32.800 --> 42:34.290
You said he wasn't gonna
be here till two.

42:34.380 --> 42:35.665
I said, "I thought."

42:35.760 --> 42:36.875
[man] Hey!

42:36.970 --> 42:38.039
[gun cocks]

42:38.130 --> 42:40.587
My shotgun just loves making new friends.

42:41.350 --> 42:42.635
-[Ruth] Fuck. Shit.
-Come on.

42:42.720 --> 42:43.675
We gotta get in the water.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.341
-[man] Hey! Is someone down there?
-[Cade] Shit.

42:51.190 --> 42:52.259
Fuck.Fuck.

43:09.830 --> 43:13.334
Wait. Lift up your shirt,
turn around, flip out your pockets.

43:13.420 --> 43:16.127
No, I'm-- I'm unarmed.
I'm-- I'm alone, just like you said.

43:16.210 --> 43:17.541
I'm just getting your kid.

43:19.510 --> 43:25.301
But I'm not giving him to you
until I know that Wendy's okay.

43:25.390 --> 43:26.960
[Zeke crying]

43:29.180 --> 43:31.398
-Wendy!
-Wendy?

43:31.480 --> 43:32.720
[Wendy] Marty, is that you?

43:35.650 --> 43:37.641
[Zeke continues crying]

43:39.990 --> 43:41.480
-[Wendy] Marty, I'm here.
-Wendy.

43:48.370 --> 43:49.860
[shushes]

43:49.960 --> 43:51.780
[Zeke wails]

43:51.870 --> 43:54.247
[gasps, panting]

43:56.670 --> 43:58.456
[coughs]

44:09.770 --> 44:14.184
[man] Like I said, my shotgun
just loves making new friends.

44:14.270 --> 44:16.261
[Cade shushes]

44:20.360 --> 44:21.395
[Ruth groans]

44:29.370 --> 44:32.498
-[door opens]
-[footsteps approach]

44:35.710 --> 44:37.200
What are you gonna do to me?

44:38.210 --> 44:39.336
[Marty] What are you talking about?

44:39.880 --> 44:40.790
As soon as I let you leave,

44:40.880 --> 44:42.836
what's to stop you from calling the police
and telling them what I did?

44:43.430 --> 44:45.716
-We would never do that, Mason.
-[Mason] He would.

44:47.050 --> 44:50.213
We had an agreement. Wendy for Zeke.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.721
As far as I'm concerned, this whole thing
is over as soon as we leave here.

44:53.810 --> 44:54.890
[Mason] How can I be so sure?

44:55.520 --> 44:57.647
Because I kept my word on that.
I'm gonna keep my word on this.

44:57.730 --> 44:58.640
-[Mason] How do I know?
-[Zeke crying]

44:58.730 --> 45:03.019
How do I know that you didn't already
call 'em and tell 'em where I'm at?

45:03.110 --> 45:04.270
-You know? How do I know...
-Mason, Mason--

45:04.360 --> 45:05.406
-...that they're not up there right now?
-[Zeke crying]

45:05.490 --> 45:08.197
Waiting for you two to walk out of here
and then come down here to...

45:08.280 --> 45:09.827
Will you shut up?

45:13.120 --> 45:14.155
What did you do to him?

45:16.130 --> 45:17.495
Here. What are you talking about?

45:17.580 --> 45:19.036
To make him this way.

45:19.130 --> 45:20.620
[Marty] I brought him straight here as--

45:21.590 --> 45:24.718
I brought him straight here
as soon as they gave him to me.

45:25.970 --> 45:29.929
Mason, it's completely natural
for a baby to cry

45:30.010 --> 45:31.420
if you haven't seen them for a while.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.090
No, no, no. He did something to him.

45:34.060 --> 45:35.049
[Marty] You're not making any sense.

45:35.140 --> 45:36.892
I'm making perfect fucking sense.

45:36.980 --> 45:38.800
There's nothing
I could have possibly done to him.

45:38.900 --> 45:40.606
You can do whatever you want.

45:41.900 --> 45:43.060
You're the Devil.

45:45.070 --> 45:48.153
Mason, we brought you your son.
There's nothing wrong with him.

45:48.620 --> 45:49.860
You gotta let us go.

45:49.950 --> 45:52.077
Not until you tell me what you did to him.

45:52.660 --> 45:55.208
He's just upset
because of the situation, Mason.

45:55.290 --> 45:57.281
[Zeke continues crying]

45:58.920 --> 45:59.739
Hey!

46:00.630 --> 46:01.619
I'm waiting.

46:03.840 --> 46:05.250
You wanna know what was done?

46:05.840 --> 46:06.966
You wanna know what was done?

46:07.050 --> 46:09.598
A fund-raising campaign to help you
while you were on the street.

46:10.260 --> 46:12.342
I warned you to go back out onto the water

46:12.430 --> 46:14.557
so that the Snells
wouldn't come after you.

46:14.640 --> 46:17.632
In fact, I begged them to let you
go back out onto the water

46:17.730 --> 46:20.972
instead of them just killing you
and Grace, right then and there.

46:21.060 --> 46:25.929
And when they didn't listen to me,
I paid $700,000 to save your lives.

46:26.030 --> 46:28.442
$700,000.

46:28.530 --> 46:30.691
Every single thing I've done has been
to help you.

46:30.780 --> 46:32.736
Everything I've told you to do has been
to help you.

46:32.830 --> 46:33.785
And what have you done?

46:33.870 --> 46:35.997
You've done the exact opposite
every single time,

46:36.080 --> 46:38.787
and what did it get you?
It got you right fucking here.

46:38.870 --> 46:40.417
[laughing]

46:40.500 --> 46:43.708
Why do I even listen to him?
All you do is lie!

46:44.840 --> 46:47.752
Wendy said so herself.
You two are criminals.

46:47.840 --> 46:49.501
-You're killers.
-No, no, no, no, no.

46:49.590 --> 46:51.888
I said that we worked with them.
I never said that we were criminals.

46:51.970 --> 46:57.226
Suppose the foot said, "I'm not a hand.
I do not belong to the body."

46:57.310 --> 47:01.428
Suppose the ear said, "I'm not an eye.
I do not belong to the body."

47:01.520 --> 47:04.398
There are many parts,
but there is only one body.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.812
Hey. What can we do
to make you believe us?

47:06.900 --> 47:07.730
Nothing.

47:07.820 --> 47:08.775
[Marty] So then,
just choose to believe us.

47:08.860 --> 47:11.192
Just make yourself believe us,
like you did with God.

47:11.280 --> 47:15.284
After you lost everything,
you made a choice to believe in God.

47:15.370 --> 47:17.156
[Zeke continues crying]

47:17.250 --> 47:18.740
I can't, not anymore.

47:20.870 --> 47:22.167
You killed that.

47:23.920 --> 47:24.739
I'm taking her. What?

47:26.760 --> 47:28.079
No, you're not. No, you're not.
Put that down.

47:28.170 --> 47:31.253
I'm gonna take Wendy
to protect her from you.

47:31.340 --> 47:33.137
'Cause whenever you're not around,
she tells the truth.

47:33.220 --> 47:35.677
Right? And the minute you show up,
you start lying.

47:35.760 --> 47:38.422
-Mason, slow down.
-Okay? He's corrupting you.

47:38.520 --> 47:40.056
Yes, you're gonna come with me.

47:40.140 --> 47:41.437
-Come over here.
-No, no, no.

47:41.520 --> 47:43.260
-Wait a second.
-You see what's happening, don't you?

47:43.360 --> 47:44.975
-You see what you're doing?
-[Mason] I'm helping you.

47:45.070 --> 47:46.640
No, it's the same thing as in that store.

47:46.730 --> 47:47.936
[ye||s, grunts]

47:50.740 --> 47:52.105
Let her go. Let her go. Let her go.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.770
Let us out of here. Let her go.

47:53.870 --> 47:55.406
-Don't do this!
-[Marty] You have everything you want--

47:55.490 --> 47:57.117
I have nothing that I want!

47:57.200 --> 48:00.613
I don't have my wife!
I don't have my faith!

48:00.710 --> 48:03.167
-Think about Zeke.
-I don't even have my son anymore!

48:03.250 --> 48:04.660
Yes, you do! He's right there.

48:04.750 --> 48:06.877
You've taken everything from me.
[breathing heavily]

48:06.960 --> 48:09.167
-Just finish the job.
-I'm not gonna do that.

48:09.260 --> 48:11.330
-Take Zeke and go.
-Or I can just push this in.

48:11.430 --> 48:13.716
Mason! Mason, put that down.
Put that... Mason!

48:13.800 --> 48:15.677
-If I just plunge this right into her--
-No!

48:15.760 --> 48:17.057
-Mason!
-[Mason yells]

48:17.140 --> 48:19.131
[grunting]

48:21.640 --> 48:23.972
God damn it. Shit.

48:24.060 --> 48:26.563
No, no. Let me help you.
Let me help you. Shit!

48:26.650 --> 48:28.277
[sobbing] Shit. No.

48:28.360 --> 48:30.772
Lay still. Lay still. Lay still.

48:30.860 --> 48:33.943
-Don't move. Just lay still. Lay still.
-[gasping] No...

48:35.320 --> 48:37.322
[Zeke continues crying]

48:45.040 --> 48:46.280
Oh, shit.

48:47.130 --> 48:50.167
Oh, God. [gasps]

48:53.510 --> 48:54.636
Oh, God.

48:54.720 --> 48:56.711
[crying]

49:05.020 --> 49:06.601
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

49:09.270 --> 49:13.695
I swear I didn't-- I didn't know
he'd be back so soon.

49:14.530 --> 49:15.986
[stammering] I--

49:16.740 --> 49:19.789
I--I promise, I promise, I promise,

49:19.870 --> 49:22.691
I'm not a fuck-up.

49:24.670 --> 49:25.739
I'm not.

49:29.040 --> 49:33.079
You just-- You gotta--
You gotta give me another chance, Daddy.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.677
I'll make it all right, Daddy.

49:39.850 --> 49:41.306
I'll make it so...

49:42.680 --> 49:45.092
you won't have to think about this.

49:51.730 --> 49:56.736
I promise I'll make you...
I'll make you so, so proud!

50:01.490 --> 50:02.946
It's all right, Ruthie.

50:04.290 --> 50:05.575
There'll be other boats.

50:07.370 --> 50:09.076
All that matters is you're okay.

50:14.260 --> 50:16.626
[sighs]

50:33.980 --> 50:36.699
I think I know where Marty's money is.

50:42.990 --> 50:49.077
A little bit ago,
I saw Wendy drive a hearse

50:50.040 --> 50:52.668
up to one of the cabins at the Blue Cat.

50:54.710 --> 51:00.137
And at the time, I thought,
"That doesn't make any sense."

51:03.220 --> 51:04.426
But now, when...

51:05.470 --> 51:10.976
I'm thinking that must have been
where they were keeping the money.

51:13.520 --> 51:19.356
I must have caught them moving it
to the funeral home.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.236
[exhales]

51:34.130 --> 51:35.620
Well, let's go get it, then.

51:44.100 --> 51:46.466
[Marty panting]

51:46.560 --> 51:48.721
[Wendy] Okay, I need you
to put these clothes on

51:48.810 --> 51:52.519
and I need you to put your clothes
in the laundry bag. Okay?

51:59.030 --> 52:01.237
What the hell are we gonna do? [sniffles]

52:03.320 --> 52:06.198
-[Wendy] We're gonna do...
-[exhales]

52:07.450 --> 52:08.747
We're gonna do what we have to do.

52:08.830 --> 52:11.151
We're gonna get rid of the body,
and we're gonna take Zeke with us.

52:11.750 --> 52:14.287
I think I'm having a fucking heart attack.
[inhales sharply]

52:14.380 --> 52:19.158
Honey, no, it's just...
it's just a panic attack, sweetie.

52:20.050 --> 52:22.257
And you're in shock,
but you have to keep breathing.

52:22.340 --> 52:23.329
-Okay, Marty?
-Yeah.

52:23.430 --> 52:25.250
Just in on the count of four...

52:25.350 --> 52:29.059
In on the count of four _
and out on the count of four, all right?

52:29.600 --> 52:30.919
-Just keep breathing.
-[panting]

52:31.020 --> 52:33.727
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I got this.

52:33.850 --> 52:36.933
Ugh. I got this. It's okay.
I'm right here.

52:37.020 --> 52:39.898
Just in on four, out on four.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.105
I'm right here.

52:42.570 --> 52:44.652
I got this. I'll take care of this.

52:44.740 --> 52:48.528
I'll take care of this, just the way
that you took care of me, so...

52:48.620 --> 52:52.738
Okay? In on four, out on four.

52:53.290 --> 52:54.575
You just keep breathing.

52:55.710 --> 52:59.828
One, two, three, four.

53:00.510 --> 53:05.129
One, two, three, four.

53:05.930 --> 53:10.219
One, two, three, four.

53:11.020 --> 53:15.684
One, two, three, four.

53:16.440 --> 53:18.476
One, two...

53:27.950 --> 53:30.908
I don ’t know that we see it
as something that has to he reconaied

53:31.910 --> 53:33.320
Wouldn't you agree, Marty?

53:38.500 --> 53:40.411
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

53:43.630 --> 53:48.215
The way we see it, we're in the business
of bringing prosperity to this lake,

53:49.100 --> 53:52.137
of helping to turn it into
a year-round tourist destination,

53:52.220 --> 53:54.097
of helping our community thrive.

53:54.180 --> 53:56.842
And isn't that what it means
to be a good neighbor?

53:57.810 --> 53:59.937
Set a good example for our children?

54:00.690 --> 54:02.021
A good person?

54:02.110 --> 54:04.271
[woman] Obviously, the FBI doesn't
see it that way.

54:04.950 --> 54:09.319
Or they wouldn't have raided your home
and brought you in for questioning, Marty.

54:13.040 --> 54:15.361
Well, they didn't bring me in.
I volunteered.

54:15.460 --> 54:16.779
Under duress.

54:16.870 --> 54:17.859
[Wendy] How do you ﬁgure?

54:18.500 --> 54:20.912
Well, they clearly thought
you had something to hide,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.753
because they felt the need to come here
in the middle of the night.

54:23.840 --> 54:25.967
Well, it was early morning, actually.

54:26.050 --> 54:28.120
When they knew
you'd least expect them.

54:29.890 --> 54:31.710
I'm curious how you explain that.

54:34.520 --> 54:35.418
Marty.

54:37.640 --> 54:40.473
You know, I'm so glad
that you brought this up.

54:40.560 --> 54:44.223
FBI scrutiny is expected
when you open a casino in this country.

54:44.320 --> 54:45.890
I mean, we all understand why.

54:45.990 --> 54:48.356
And we laud the very thorough work

54:48.450 --> 54:51.317
the federal agents are doing
to keep us safe.

54:51.660 --> 54:54.697
It's why Marty cooperated
when they came here.

54:54.790 --> 54:58.499
And it's why we prepared
for that scrutiny as a family.

54:58.580 --> 55:01.037
In fact, we welcome it
because we know it's necessary,

55:01.130 --> 55:02.745
and we don't have anything to hide.

55:03.340 --> 55:04.295
At the end of the day,

55:04.380 --> 55:07.759
the FBI’s going to find
what everybody finds when they meet us.

55:07.840 --> 55:10.798
And I encourage people to come on up,

55:10.890 --> 55:13.927
I mean, introduce themselves to us
when they see us around

55:14.010 --> 55:17.764
They’re going to find a fam/iy
that’s very much him their own.

55:17.850 --> 55:19.010
[Zeke coos]

55:20.020 --> 55:23.262
[Wendy]
We work hard.
We make time for fam/iy.

55:24.070 --> 55:26.311
We try and treat our ne/ghhors
with respect

55:26.400 --> 55:28.698
and teach our ch/idren to do the same.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.980
And we sacrifice for each other.

55:32.070 --> 55:34.823
[chuck/es]
Sometimes a hit more
than we bargained for,

55:34.910 --> 55:37.868
but we make our peace
with those sacrifices

55:37.950 --> 55:41.078
because we /0 ve each other, very much.

56:00.230 --> 56:03.859
So much so, that as you can see,

56:04.560 --> 56:08.064
we all came together as a family
and decided to help a friend out in need

56:08.150 --> 56:10.027
and foster his son for a bit.

56:18.330 --> 56:21.367
And when I put it that way,
we sound kind of boring.

56:22.960 --> 56:24.200
What do you think, Marty?

56:24.880 --> 56:25.949
Are we boring?

56:31.420 --> 56:32.421
Sorry.
