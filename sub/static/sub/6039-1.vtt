<i>This is the night</i>

<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

00:26.546 --> 00:32.143

00:33.626 --> 00:36.345
<i>Look at the skies</i>

00:36.426 --> 00:40.101

00:53.266 --> 00:58.340

00:59.706 --> 01:05.019
<i>To keep from falling like a star</i>

01:05.105 --> 01:09.224
<i>When you make that dizzy climb</i>

01:09.306 --> 01:13.857
<i>For this is the night</i>

03:00.626 --> 03:02.059
[man] It's for you, darling.

03:02.146 --> 03:03.499
Merry Christmas.

03:03.586 --> 03:05.463
Oh, Jim, dear.

03:05.546 --> 03:07.582
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?

03:07.666 --> 03:09.657
- Trimmed with ribbons?
- [whimpering]

03:09.746 --> 03:13.136
[Jim] Well, it has a ribbon.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.784
[gasping]

03:14.866 --> 03:17.983
Oh, how sweet.

03:18.386 --> 03:20.820
- [Jim] You like her, darling?
- Oh, I love her.

03:24.466 --> 03:27.617
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.

03:37.906 --> 03:39.942
Come on, Lady. Over here.

03:41.706 --> 03:43.298
That's a girl.

03:45.106 --> 03:48.496
There, now. A nice little bed for you.

03:48.586 --> 03:51.817
[Darling] But Jim, dear, are you sure
she'll be warm enough?

03:51.906 --> 03:54.898
[Jim] Why, of course, darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a...

03:54.986 --> 03:56.135
Uh-oh!

03:56.226 --> 03:57.898
Almost forgot something.

03:58.946 --> 04:00.504
There.

04:00.586 --> 04:02.224
[Jim] Good night, Lady.

04:02.306 --> 04:03.978
Now, now, don't worry, darling.

04:04.066 --> 04:05.738
She'll go right to sleep.

04:07.946 --> 04:09.174
No, no, Lady.

04:11.466 --> 04:14.458
This is where you belong, right here.

04:30.986 --> 04:33.136
- [whimpering]
- [Darling] Oh, look.

04:33.226 --> 04:35.057
She's lonesome.

04:35.146 --> 04:37.979
Don't you think maybe?
Just for tonight?

04:38.066 --> 04:40.899
[Jim] Darling, if we're going
to show her who's master,

04:40.986 --> 04:42.977
we must be firm from the very beginning.

05:03.466 --> 05:06.344
[whimpering]

05:17.066 --> 05:18.704
[Jim pounding on ceiling] Lady!

05:18.786 --> 05:19.980
Stop that now!

05:20.066 --> 05:21.658
Stop it!

05:21.746 --> 05:24.135
[whimpering]

05:28.026 --> 05:29.823
[footsteps]

05:32.506 --> 05:34.576
[whimpering]

05:37.866 --> 05:39.584
[Jim pounding on door] Lady!

05:39.666 --> 05:41.497
[Jim] Quiet, now. You hear me?

05:41.586 --> 05:43.577
Back to bed!

05:43.666 --> 05:45.782
Quick, now.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.743
Not one more sound.

05:50.506 --> 05:53.304
[chiming]

05:53.386 --> 05:55.946
[scraping]

06:30.186 --> 06:32.256
[snoring]

06:41.746 --> 06:44.544
- [whimpering]
- [Darling] Jim, dear.

06:44.626 --> 06:47.140
[groaning]

06:48.666 --> 06:51.339
[whimpering]

06:52.346 --> 06:53.461
Aw, Jim.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.218
[Jim] Hmm? What?

06:58.986 --> 07:01.056
[whimpering, howling]

07:01.146 --> 07:02.738
[Jim yawning]

07:02.826 --> 07:04.578
[Jim] Oh, all right.

07:05.706 --> 07:08.220
But remember, just for tonight.

07:23.586 --> 07:26.384
[rooster crowing]

07:26.466 --> 07:28.024
[chiming]

07:36.906 --> 07:38.464
[Darling groaning]

07:48.426 --> 07:50.656
[yawns] All right, Lady. All right.

07:50.746 --> 07:53.260
I'm up. I'm up, Lady.

07:53.346 --> 07:56.144
Oh, no!

07:56.226 --> 07:58.262
[Darling] What's wrong, Jim? What is it?

07:58.346 --> 08:00.576
Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays?

08:06.346 --> 08:07.984
[barking]

08:36.066 --> 08:37.624
[growling, barking]

08:43.466 --> 08:45.980
[bicycle bell rings]

09:09.906 --> 09:12.784
[Jim] Have you noticed,
darling, since we've had Lady

09:12.866 --> 09:16.381
we see less and less
of those disturbing headlines?

09:16.466 --> 09:20.095
[Darling] Yes, I just don't know
how we ever got along without her.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.746
[Jim] Say, she must be
about six months old.

09:23.826 --> 09:25.862
We'd better be getting her a license.

09:40.466 --> 09:41.819
Hope it fits.

09:43.066 --> 09:45.421
My, but it does look nice.

09:45.506 --> 09:46.939
So grown up.

09:47.026 --> 09:49.540
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?

09:54.506 --> 09:56.417
[humming]

10:04.946 --> 10:08.063
<i>Four steps straight</i>
<i>and then to the left</i>

10:08.146 --> 10:11.502
<i>And right to the place</i>
<i>where I marked it</i>

10:11.586 --> 10:15.704
<i>With a bonnie, bonnie bone</i>
<i>that I buried for me own</i>

10:15.786 --> 10:20.177
<i>In my bonnie, bonnie bank</i>
<i>in the backyard</i>

10:20.266 --> 10:23.099
A-ha, that's a grand sight.

10:23.186 --> 10:24.460
[Lady] Jock!

10:26.266 --> 10:28.018
Oh, Jock!

10:33.546 --> 10:35.059
Hello, Jock.

10:35.146 --> 10:38.104
Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie. [chuckles]

10:38.186 --> 10:40.142
Notice anything different?

10:40.226 --> 10:42.740
Eh, uh... You've had a bath?

10:42.866 --> 10:44.822
No, not that.

10:44.906 --> 10:47.056
You've had your nails clipped?

10:47.146 --> 10:49.944
[Lady] Mm-mmm. Guess again.

10:50.026 --> 10:53.701
Well, I wouldn't a-be knowin'.

10:56.826 --> 10:58.259
Why-o, lassie.

10:58.346 --> 11:00.337
A bonnie new collar.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.498
- Do you like it?
- Aye. [sniffs]

11:03.586 --> 11:07.261
Mmm. It must be very expensive.

11:07.346 --> 11:09.814
- Have you shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.

11:09.906 --> 11:11.942
Ah, we'd best go at once.

11:12.026 --> 11:15.621
You know how sensitive
he is about these things.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.784
[snoring]

11:24.026 --> 11:25.823
[whimpering]

11:28.426 --> 11:31.338
[snorting, howling]

11:34.946 --> 11:36.664
He's dreaming.

11:36.746 --> 11:37.940
[Jock] Aye.

11:38.026 --> 11:40.062
Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days

11:40.146 --> 11:43.183
when he and his grandfather
were trackin' criminals

11:43.266 --> 11:44.779
through the swamps.

11:44.866 --> 11:48.142
- [Lady] They were?
- That was before...

11:48.226 --> 11:50.342
Before what?

11:50.426 --> 11:53.736
'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie.

11:53.826 --> 11:56.021
[Jock] It shouldn't
have happened to a dog.

11:56.106 --> 11:58.825
But, well...

11:58.906 --> 12:01.978
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.

12:02.066 --> 12:04.739
- [Lady gasps] No!
- [Jock] Aye.

12:04.826 --> 12:07.863
But we must never let on
that we know, lassie.

12:08.946 --> 12:11.824
It would break his poor heart.

12:18.186 --> 12:20.461
Uh... Which way did he go?

12:20.546 --> 12:22.264
Which way did he go?

12:22.346 --> 12:25.179
- Go?
- [Trusty] Yeah, big fella.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.063
About, uh, six-foot-two.

12:27.146 --> 12:29.216
[sniffs] No, uh, three.

12:29.306 --> 12:32.104
Wore a striped suit. No collar.

12:33.066 --> 12:36.058
Why, Miss Lady.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.421
You have a collar.

12:38.506 --> 12:40.974
Mm-hmm. And a license.

12:41.066 --> 12:42.863
My, my.

12:42.946 --> 12:45.824
- How time does fly.
- Aye.

12:45.906 --> 12:47.862
It seems only yesterday she was

12:47.946 --> 12:50.301
cuttin' her teeth
on Jim Dear's slippers,

12:50.386 --> 12:54.379
and now there she is, a full-grown lady.

12:54.466 --> 12:58.823
Wearin' the greatest honour
man can bestow.

12:58.906 --> 13:01.261
The badge of faith and respectability.

13:02.746 --> 13:05.101
That's right, Miss Lady.

13:05.186 --> 13:09.099
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

13:09.186 --> 13:12.622
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

13:12.706 --> 13:14.936
Aye, you have, laddie.

13:15.026 --> 13:16.857
Oh, yeah.

13:16.946 --> 13:19.335
- [whistling]
- Ooh, it's Jim Dear.

13:20.546 --> 13:22.696
Please excuse me.

13:25.586 --> 13:27.816
Hello, there, Lady.

13:27.906 --> 13:29.339
Come on, beat you home.

13:35.746 --> 13:37.498
Oh, you win again.

13:37.586 --> 13:38.905
Steady, now.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.783
Steady.

13:40.866 --> 13:43.141
Well, what have we here?

13:43.226 --> 13:45.786
Oh, big girl now, huh?

13:45.866 --> 13:47.015
All right.

13:47.106 --> 13:49.097
Oh, ladies first.

13:55.106 --> 13:57.176
You know, darling, with Lady here

13:57.266 --> 13:59.416
I'd say life is quite complete.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.098
[Darling] Yes, dear.

14:01.186 --> 14:04.417
I don't imagine anything could
ever take her place in our hearts.

14:09.066 --> 14:10.784
[steam hissing]

14:20.866 --> 14:22.538
[train whistle blows]

14:23.746 --> 14:26.863

14:42.306 --> 14:44.024
[shuddering]

14:46.706 --> 14:49.539
Ah! What a day!

14:49.626 --> 14:52.538
Well, now to dig up some breakfast.

15:01.346 --> 15:04.065
Hmm? [chuckles]

15:04.146 --> 15:07.024
Aw, cute little rascals.

15:08.386 --> 15:10.342
Cootchie-cootchie-coo.

15:12.266 --> 15:15.383
Now. That breakfast, let's see.

15:16.466 --> 15:17.899
Bernie's?

15:17.986 --> 15:19.305
Mmm... no.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.785
Francois...

15:21.666 --> 15:22.701
No, no.

15:22.786 --> 15:24.822
Nope. Too much starch. Ah!

15:24.906 --> 15:27.136
Tony's. Oh, that's it.

15:27.666 --> 15:29.418
I haven't been there in a week.

15:31.106 --> 15:33.745
<i>[Tony] A beautiful day</i>
<i>to make pizza</i>

15:33.826 --> 15:37.865
<i>Hey, still we call it bella notte</i>

15:37.946 --> 15:39.584
[scratching]

15:39.666 --> 15:42.624
Well, <i>buon giorno,</i> Butch.

15:42.706 --> 15:45.061
You want-a your breakfast, eh?

15:45.146 --> 15:48.900
OK. The boss, he's a-saving
some a-nice bones for you.

15:48.986 --> 15:52.581
Breakfast comin' up from a-left field.

15:52.666 --> 15:54.622
[chuckles] Good catch!

15:57.746 --> 15:59.498
[man whistling]

16:00.626 --> 16:02.298
[man] Whoa, boy, whoa.

16:02.386 --> 16:04.695
[whistling continues]

16:11.346 --> 16:14.418
[man humming]

16:37.066 --> 16:39.057
Hey. Psst. Psst.

16:40.826 --> 16:42.179
Blimey.

16:42.266 --> 16:44.939
- Look, Peg, it's the Tramp.
- [Tramp] Shh.

16:45.026 --> 16:48.063
Hiya, handsome.
Come to join the party?

16:48.146 --> 16:50.182
All right. No time for wisecracks.

16:50.266 --> 16:51.779
I've got to get you out.

16:51.866 --> 16:53.697
I'm telling you, the pressure's on.

16:53.786 --> 16:55.060
Signs all over town.

16:55.146 --> 16:58.741
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.

16:58.866 --> 17:01.619
- OK, OK, get going.
- [man] Hey! What's going on there?

17:01.706 --> 17:05.016
Scram. And be careful.

17:05.106 --> 17:07.574
- [snarling]
- Why, you mangy mutt.

17:07.665 --> 17:09.338
Hey. Let go. Let go of me.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.816
Well. Snob hill. Ha!

17:34.826 --> 17:36.942
Hi, gals. How's pickings?

17:38.626 --> 17:40.423
Pretty slim, eh?

17:40.506 --> 17:44.021
Yeah. I'll bet they've got
a lid on every trash can.

17:44.106 --> 17:47.781
Uh-oh. And a fence around every tree.

17:47.866 --> 17:51.859
[chuckles] I wonder what
the leash and collar set

17:51.946 --> 17:53.538
does for excitement.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.577
Lassie. Lassie!

18:01.666 --> 18:05.818
Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am.

18:06.666 --> 18:09.544
Miss Lady!

18:10.466 --> 18:12.297
[Jock] Ah! Good morning, lassie.

18:12.386 --> 18:15.503
'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day. Uh...

18:15.586 --> 18:16.905
...day.

18:16.986 --> 18:19.181
Why, Miss Lady.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.097
Is something wrong?

18:21.186 --> 18:22.744
Aye. Tell us, lassie.

18:22.826 --> 18:25.624
- If somebody's been mistreatin' ya...
- Oh, no, Jock.

18:25.706 --> 18:28.937
It's something I've done, I guess.

18:29.026 --> 18:30.618
You?

18:30.706 --> 18:32.219
It must be.

18:32.306 --> 18:35.616
- Jim Dear and Darling are acting so...
- [Darling humming]

18:36.746 --> 18:39.260
[humming continues]

18:39.346 --> 18:42.895
- Jim Dear and Darling?
- Hush, lad.

18:51.906 --> 18:53.624
Now, lassie,

18:53.706 --> 18:55.503
get on with the details.

18:55.586 --> 18:57.975
Well, I first noticed it

18:58.066 --> 19:00.341
the other day
when Jim Dear came home.

19:00.426 --> 19:02.542
[clock chiming]

19:03.946 --> 19:05.220
[barking]

19:11.186 --> 19:12.335
Down, Lady, down!

19:17.226 --> 19:19.262
Darling, darling!

19:19.346 --> 19:20.779
Are you all right?

19:20.866 --> 19:23.255
[Darling] Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?

19:28.626 --> 19:30.423
[Jim] I just can't help worrying.

19:30.506 --> 19:32.497
After all, in your condition,

19:32.586 --> 19:33.905
alone here all day,

19:33.986 --> 19:35.738
and walking that dog...

19:36.866 --> 19:39.744
- That dog!
- That dog?

19:39.826 --> 19:42.294
He's never called me that before.

19:42.386 --> 19:44.183
Well, now, lassie,

19:44.266 --> 19:46.734
I wouldn't worry
my wee head about that.

19:46.826 --> 19:49.579
Remember,
they're only humans, after all.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.941
That's right, Miss Lady.

19:52.026 --> 19:55.939
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

19:56.026 --> 19:59.621
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

19:59.706 --> 20:02.140
Aye, you have, laddie.

20:02.226 --> 20:05.104
- Frequently.
- Oh, yeah.

20:05.186 --> 20:07.859
But now Darling is... Well...

20:07.946 --> 20:10.619
We've always enjoyed
our afternoon romp together.

20:10.706 --> 20:12.458
But yesterday...

20:12.546 --> 20:14.218
[chiming]

20:14.306 --> 20:16.422
[barking]

20:16.506 --> 20:19.339
[humming]

20:25.866 --> 20:27.424
[whining]

20:27.506 --> 20:30.578
No, Lady. No walk today.

20:30.666 --> 20:32.861
[humming continues]

20:36.426 --> 20:38.417
[barking]

20:40.506 --> 20:41.780
No, Lady.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.424
Not now.

20:45.226 --> 20:46.625
Lady!

20:46.706 --> 20:48.219
Drop that, Lady.

20:49.426 --> 20:51.018
Drop it, I say.

20:52.906 --> 20:54.897
It didn't hurt, really.

20:54.986 --> 20:58.501
But Darling has
never struck me... before.

21:00.786 --> 21:02.219
[chuckling] Now, lassie.

21:02.306 --> 21:04.342
Do not take it too seriously.

21:04.426 --> 21:06.417
After all, at a time like this...

21:06.506 --> 21:09.543
Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady,

21:09.626 --> 21:11.184
there comes a time

21:11.266 --> 21:14.258
in the life of all humans when, uh...

21:14.346 --> 21:17.816
Well, as they put it, uh...

21:17.906 --> 21:20.374
Birds and the bees?

21:20.466 --> 21:22.297
Or... Well, uh...

21:22.386 --> 21:25.901
The stork. You know. Uh, no?

21:25.986 --> 21:28.898
- Well, uh...
- What he's trying to say, lassie,

21:28.986 --> 21:32.456
is Darling is expecting a wee bairn.

21:32.546 --> 21:33.740
Bairn?

21:33.826 --> 21:36.704
He means a baby, Miss Lady.

21:36.786 --> 21:38.378
Oh.

21:38.466 --> 21:40.696
What's a baby?

21:40.786 --> 21:43.425
[Jock] Well, they resemble humans.

21:43.506 --> 21:46.896
[Trusty] But I'd say a mite smaller.

21:46.986 --> 21:49.136
[Jock] Aye. And they walk on all fours.

21:49.226 --> 21:53.219
[Trusty] And if I remember correctly,
they bellow a lot.

21:53.306 --> 21:56.184
Aye. And they're very expensive.

21:56.266 --> 21:58.336
You will not be permitted
to play with it.

21:58.426 --> 22:00.781
But they're mighty sweet.

22:00.866 --> 22:03.505
And very, very soft.

22:03.586 --> 22:05.816
Just a cute little bundle. [chuckles]

22:05.906 --> 22:07.862
[Tramp] Of trouble.

22:07.946 --> 22:10.585
Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears...

22:10.666 --> 22:13.658
Aw, but shucks.
Any dog can take that.

22:13.746 --> 22:15.543
It's what they do to your happy home.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.184
Move it over, will you, friend?

22:17.266 --> 22:19.143
Homewreckers, that's what they are.

22:19.226 --> 22:21.342
Look here, laddie.
Who are you to barge in?

22:21.426 --> 22:23.894
The voice of experience, buster.

22:23.986 --> 22:28.059
[chuckles] Just wait
till junior gets here.

22:28.146 --> 22:30.706
You get the urge for
a nice comfortable scratch,

22:30.786 --> 22:33.016
and, "Put that dog out!"

22:33.106 --> 22:34.937
He'll get fleas all over the baby."

22:35.026 --> 22:37.665
You start barking
at some strange mutt.

22:37.746 --> 22:39.259
[barks]

22:39.346 --> 22:41.985
"Stop that racket.
You'll wake the baby."

22:42.066 --> 22:43.624
And then!

22:43.706 --> 22:47.062
Then they hit you in the
room and board department.

22:48.146 --> 22:51.058
Remember those nice, juicy cuts of beef?

22:53.026 --> 22:54.664
<i>[Tramp] Forget them.</i>

22:54.746 --> 22:56.976
<i>Leftover baby food.</i>

22:57.066 --> 22:59.421
<i>And that nice, warm bed by the fire?</i>

22:59.506 --> 23:01.701
<i>[chuckles]</i>

23:01.786 --> 23:02.980
<i>[thunderclap]</i>

23:05.426 --> 23:07.462
<i>A leaky doghouse.</i>

23:07.546 --> 23:09.662
- Oh, dear.
- Do not listen, lassie.

23:09.746 --> 23:11.384
No human is that cruel.

23:11.466 --> 23:13.821
Of course not, Miss Lady.

23:13.906 --> 23:16.215
Why, everybody knows

23:16.306 --> 23:19.616
a dog's best friend is his human.

23:19.706 --> 23:21.185
[Tramp laughing]

23:21.266 --> 23:23.063
Oh, come on now, fellas.

23:23.146 --> 23:25.899
You haven't fallen
for that old line, now have you?

23:25.986 --> 23:28.864
Aye. And we've no need for mongrels

23:28.946 --> 23:31.062
and their radical ideas.

23:31.146 --> 23:32.704
Off with you, now. Off with you!

23:32.786 --> 23:34.378
- OK, Sandy.
- The name's Jock.

23:34.466 --> 23:36.696
- OK, Jock.
- Heather Lad of Glencairn to you!

23:36.786 --> 23:39.061
OK, OK, OK.

23:39.146 --> 23:40.545
But remember this, Pigeon.

23:40.626 --> 23:44.301
A human heart has only so much
room for love and affection.

23:44.386 --> 23:46.377
When a baby moves in,

23:46.466 --> 23:49.538
the dog moves out.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.258
[Jim] Uh-huh.

23:55.346 --> 23:58.497
Oh, let's see. That'll be about...

23:59.946 --> 24:01.345
Oh, well.

24:06.226 --> 24:08.421
[pounding]

24:08.506 --> 24:09.859
[Jim] Darling?

24:09.946 --> 24:11.902
There isn't any way we can tell for sure

24:11.986 --> 24:13.783
what it's going to be, is there?

24:13.866 --> 24:15.345
[Darling] I'm afraid not.

24:15.426 --> 24:17.576
Nobody ever knows for certain.

24:17.666 --> 24:20.226
All we can do is hope.

24:24.906 --> 24:26.385
[chiming]

24:26.466 --> 24:28.343
[footsteps]

24:30.466 --> 24:31.740

24:40.666 --> 24:42.258
[wind howling]

24:43.746 --> 24:45.384
[door closes]

24:45.466 --> 24:49.015
Darling, are you sure
you want watermelon?

24:49.106 --> 24:50.619
[Darling] Mm-hmm.

24:50.706 --> 24:53.174
Oh, and some chop suey too.

24:53.266 --> 24:54.779
Chop su...

24:54.866 --> 24:57.858
[sighs] Oh, all right, darling.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.780
[door shuts]

25:04.466 --> 25:06.263
[women giggling and chattering]

25:08.306 --> 25:09.864
[woman 1]... the cutest thing.

25:09.946 --> 25:12.540
- [woman 2] Those booties!
- [woman 3] That bonnet.

25:12.626 --> 25:15.504
- [woman 4] Adorable.
- [woman 5] Don't you love showers?

25:15.586 --> 25:17.895
[woman 6] I've never seen
you more beautiful.

25:17.986 --> 25:19.419
[woman 7] Isn't she radiant?

25:19.506 --> 25:21.417
[woman 8] That's just
what I told Bill.

25:21.506 --> 25:24.145
"Bill", I said, "Darling
looks positively radiant."

25:24.226 --> 25:26.820
In all my days,
"I've never seen anyone as radiant."

25:26.906 --> 25:28.498
[men laughing]

25:30.066 --> 25:31.897
[man 1] Aw, Jim, you look terrible.

25:31.986 --> 25:33.578
[man 2] Absolutely horrible.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.622
[man 3] I never saw you look worse.

25:35.706 --> 25:39.255
[man 4] Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones
has never lost a father yet.

25:39.346 --> 25:40.745
[laughter]

25:44.226 --> 25:45.705
[thunderclap]

25:50.786 --> 25:52.663
[Jim] Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's a boy.

25:52.746 --> 25:54.179
Uh-huh, a boy. And...

25:54.266 --> 25:55.699
What's that?

25:55.786 --> 25:57.378
Eyes?

25:57.466 --> 25:58.945
Oh, what colour are they?

25:59.026 --> 26:00.254
Well... Oh, gosh.

26:00.346 --> 26:02.814
l-I forgot to look.

26:02.906 --> 26:05.784
A boy. It's a boy, it's a... Doctor!

26:07.066 --> 26:08.419
Doctor, it's a boy!

26:08.506 --> 26:10.497
Yes, yes, I know.

26:10.586 --> 26:12.338
Uh-huh, a boy.

26:12.426 --> 26:13.779
Oh, boy, oh, boy!

26:13.866 --> 26:15.857
It's a boy, it's a boy, it's a boy!

26:15.946 --> 26:17.982
<i>[Aunt Sarah on phone]</i>
<i>Hello? Hello, Jim?</i>

26:18.066 --> 26:19.385
<i>Are you there, Jim?</i>

26:19.466 --> 26:21.980
<i>Central, we've been cut off.</i>

26:55.306 --> 26:58.776
<i>I just can't understand</i>

27:00.546 --> 27:03.936
<i>It must be something wonderful</i>

27:04.026 --> 27:07.939
<i>It must be something grand</i>

<i>In a kind and wistful way</i>

<i>And they haven't even noticed</i>

There, now.

29:21.266 --> 29:23.097
Little star sweeper.

29:23.186 --> 29:24.778
Dream on.

29:38.146 --> 29:40.057
Well, that should do it.

29:40.146 --> 29:43.138
We've got enough here
to take us halfway to China.

We haven't much time.

29:52.386 --> 29:54.502
[Darling] Jim, I just can't leave him.

29:54.586 --> 29:57.100
He's still so small and helpless.

29:57.186 --> 29:58.858
[Jim] He'll be all right.

29:58.946 --> 30:01.585
Now come on. If he wakes up
we'll never get away.

30:01.666 --> 30:04.783
Jim, I feel so guilty
deserting him like this.

30:04.866 --> 30:06.584
[Jim] Nonsense.

30:08.746 --> 30:11.544
[Jim] Hey.
What's the matter with Lady?

30:11.626 --> 30:14.379
[Darling] She thinks
we're running out on him.

30:14.466 --> 30:16.696
[Jim] Oh, don't worry, old girl.

30:16.786 --> 30:18.265
We'll be back in a few days.

30:18.346 --> 30:20.302
[Darling] And Aunt Sarah will be here.

Coming, Aunt Sarah. Coming!

Hope I haven't kept you waiting.

30:31.466 --> 30:33.457
- [Jim] Let me take your things.
- No, no.

30:33.546 --> 30:35.616
No fussing. I know my way around.

30:35.706 --> 30:37.822
On your way, now.
Mustn't miss your train.

Goodbye, dears. Goodbye, goodbye.

Oh, you adorable little...

[gasps] Good gracious!
What are you doing here?

31:03.266 --> 31:05.939
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo.
Scat. Get out of here.

32:14.626 --> 32:16.184
[barking]

32:26.226 --> 32:29.980
Do you seeing that thing
swimming round and round?

32:30.066 --> 32:31.658
Yesss.

32:31.746 --> 32:35.421
Maybe we can reaching in
and make it drown.

32:36.626 --> 32:40.301
If we sneaking up upon it carefully...

32:41.906 --> 32:45.660
<i>There will be a head</i>
<i>for you, a tail for me</i>

32:56.706 --> 32:58.617
[crashing]

33:05.626 --> 33:07.696
[baby crying]

33:07.786 --> 33:10.254
Do you hear what I hear?

33:10.346 --> 33:13.463
[purrs] A baby cry.

33:13.546 --> 33:17.983
<i>Where we're finding baby</i>
<i>there are milk nearby</i>

33:18.066 --> 33:21.820
<i>If we look in baby buggy</i>
<i>there could be</i>

33:23.186 --> 33:27.065
<i>Plenty milk for you</i>
<i>and also some for me</i>

33:28.026 --> 33:29.505
[growling]

33:29.586 --> 33:31.338
- [screeching]
- [barking]

33:36.626 --> 33:38.423
[Sarah] What's going on down there?

33:39.066 --> 33:42.263
[gasps] Merciful heavens! My darlings.

33:42.346 --> 33:44.064
- My precious pets.
- [yowling]

33:44.146 --> 33:48.139
Oh. Ooh, that wicked animal.

33:48.226 --> 33:52.697
Attacking my poor,
innocent little angels.

33:56.946 --> 33:58.459
[man] Good afternoon, ma'am.

33:58.546 --> 34:00.218
What can I do for you?

34:00.306 --> 34:02.820
I want a muzzle.
A good, strong muzzle.

34:02.906 --> 34:05.374
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Now here's our latest.

34:05.466 --> 34:07.855
Combination leash and muzzle.

34:07.946 --> 34:10.335
Now, we'll just slip it on like this,

34:10.426 --> 34:11.905
and... No! No, no, no.

34:11.985 --> 34:14.261
Nice doggy. No, don't wiggle.

34:14.346 --> 34:15.665
Steady, now.

34:15.746 --> 34:16.735
Now... Now, now.

34:16.826 --> 34:18.225
Careful, you little...

34:18.306 --> 34:19.944
[Sarah] Watch out.

34:20.025 --> 34:22.494
- [man] Careful, doggy.
- [Sarah] Come back!

34:22.585 --> 34:24.656
Get over here, I say.
Come back here.

34:26.306 --> 34:27.580
[horn beeping]

34:29.746 --> 34:31.543
[horn beeping]

34:31.626 --> 34:33.456
[streetcar bell ringing]

34:44.626 --> 34:46.581
[barking]

35:19.866 --> 35:21.424
[snarling]

35:24.986 --> 35:26.942
[growling]

35:51.546 --> 35:53.696
[whimpering]

35:53.786 --> 35:55.902
[panting, snorts]

35:57.746 --> 36:00.624
Hey, Pige, what are you doing
on this side of the tracks?

36:00.706 --> 36:02.185
I thought you...

36:02.266 --> 36:03.415
Wh?

36:03.506 --> 36:06.498
Aw, you poor kid.

36:06.586 --> 36:09.498
Oh, we've got to get this off.

36:09.586 --> 36:10.621
Hmm.

36:10.706 --> 36:13.982
I think I know the very place.

36:14.066 --> 36:15.818
Come on.

36:18.906 --> 36:20.544
Well, here we are.

36:20.626 --> 36:23.094
- The zoo?
- Sure.

36:24.906 --> 36:26.942
No, no. This way.

36:27.026 --> 36:28.698
Follow me.

36:33.346 --> 36:36.224
[guard humming]

36:37.266 --> 36:39.257
- [Lady] Oh.
- What's the matter, Pige?

36:39.346 --> 36:41.940
- We can't go in.
- Why not?

36:42.026 --> 36:44.938
- [Lady] The sign says...
- [Tramp] Yeah, well, that's...

36:45.026 --> 36:47.062
- That's the angle.
- Angle?

36:47.146 --> 36:49.057
Look. We'll just wait for the right...

36:49.146 --> 36:52.297
Uh-oh. Here we are now.

36:52.386 --> 36:53.865
Just lay low.

36:59.026 --> 37:00.584
[whistling]

37:01.546 --> 37:03.502
[barking]

37:03.586 --> 37:06.100
- [guard] Hey, you!
- I beg your pardon.

37:06.186 --> 37:09.303
- Were you addressing?
- What's the matter? Can't you read?

37:09.386 --> 37:11.502
Why, yes, in several languages.

37:11.586 --> 37:13.895
Oh, a wise guy, eh?

37:13.986 --> 37:17.695
All right, now,
what's this creature doing here?

37:17.786 --> 37:20.380
- He's not my dog.
- Oh, he's not, eh?

37:20.466 --> 37:21.660
Go away. Get down.

37:21.746 --> 37:23.577
Go on. Why, certainly not, officer.

37:23.666 --> 37:25.418
I suppose you'll be tellin' me next

37:25.506 --> 37:27.383
it was the dog that was whistling, eh?

37:27.466 --> 37:30.981
- [man] I'm certain I don't know.
- Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I?

37:31.066 --> 37:32.784
Well, you listen to me.

37:32.866 --> 37:35.016
A-ha! Resisting an officer of the law.

37:35.106 --> 37:36.380
You're gonna pay.

37:36.466 --> 37:37.455
Ow!

37:37.546 --> 37:38.945
Pull a knife on me, will you?

37:39.026 --> 37:40.778
Trying to assassinate me, you are.

37:40.866 --> 37:42.743
Carrying concealed weapons.

37:42.826 --> 37:45.135
[arguing continues]

37:50.386 --> 37:51.705
Come on, Pige.

37:51.786 --> 37:53.504
The place is ours.

37:53.586 --> 37:55.497
[arguing continues]

37:59.146 --> 38:01.614
We better go through
this place from A to Z.

38:03.066 --> 38:04.181
Apes.

38:05.306 --> 38:07.262
No, no. No use even asking them.

38:07.346 --> 38:09.177
They wouldn't understand.

38:09.266 --> 38:10.540
They wouldn't?

38:10.626 --> 38:13.220
Uh-uh. Too closely related to humans.

38:13.306 --> 38:14.625
Uh-oh.

38:14.706 --> 38:17.584
[Tramp] Alligators.
Now there's an idea.

38:17.666 --> 38:21.022
Say, Al, do you suppose you
could nip this contraption off for us?

38:21.106 --> 38:23.574
[echoing] Glad to oblige.

38:23.666 --> 38:25.577
Whoa. Whoa!

38:25.666 --> 38:27.622
[hysterical laughter]

38:34.986 --> 38:37.978
Ha! If anybody ever needed
a muzzle, it's him.

38:38.066 --> 38:41.103
- [animal] Timber!
- Pigeon, look out!

38:42.746 --> 38:44.657
Now what harebrained idiot would...

38:44.746 --> 38:46.862
Hey, look. A beaver.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.936
There's the answer to our problem.

38:52.026 --> 38:53.505
Let me see here.

38:55.026 --> 38:58.223
Six-foot-six
and seven-sixteenth inches.

38:58.306 --> 38:59.341
Pardon me, friend.

39:00.786 --> 39:03.539
- I wonder if you'd do us a little...
- Busy, sonny. Busy.

39:03.626 --> 39:05.617
Can't stop to gossip now.

39:05.706 --> 39:08.504
Got to slide this sycamore
to the... [straining]

39:08.586 --> 39:09.621
...swamp.

39:09.706 --> 39:11.583
Well, this will only take a second.

39:11.666 --> 39:13.702
Only a second? Listen, sonny.

39:13.786 --> 39:17.665
Do you realise every second,
70 centimetres of water

39:17.746 --> 39:19.657
is wasted over that spillway?

39:19.746 --> 39:22.818
- [Tramp] Yeah, but...
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.

39:22.906 --> 39:24.419
Gotta get it moving.

39:24.506 --> 39:26.895
Think the cuttin' takes the time?

39:26.986 --> 39:29.819
It's the doggone haulin'.

39:29.906 --> 39:31.305
[straining]

39:31.386 --> 39:33.456
[Tramp] The haulin'. Exactly.

39:33.546 --> 39:36.856
- Now, what you need...
- I'd better bisect this section here.

39:36.946 --> 39:38.743
What you need is a log puller.

39:39.866 --> 39:42.619
[shouting] I said a log puller!

39:44.106 --> 39:45.937
I ain't deaf, sonny.

39:46.026 --> 39:47.584
There's no need to...

39:47.666 --> 39:49.975
Did you say log puller?

39:50.066 --> 39:53.058
And by a lucky coincidence
you see before you,

39:53.146 --> 39:54.977
modelled by the lovely little lady,

39:55.066 --> 39:56.579
the new, improved,

39:56.666 --> 40:00.295
patented, handy dandy,
never-fail little giant log puller.

40:00.386 --> 40:02.342
The busy beaver's friend.

40:02.426 --> 40:03.745
You don't say?

40:03.826 --> 40:06.021
Guaranteed not to wear,
tear, rip or ravel.

40:06.106 --> 40:08.700
Turn around and show
the customer the merchandise.

40:08.786 --> 40:11.698
And it cuts
log-hauling time 66 per cent.

40:12.466 --> 40:14.821
Sixty-six per cent, eh?

40:14.946 --> 40:16.698
[giggles] Think of that.

40:16.786 --> 40:19.858
- Well, how's it work?
- Why, it's no work at all.

40:19.946 --> 40:22.414
You merely slip this ring
over the limb like this,

40:22.506 --> 40:23.700
and haul it off.

40:23.786 --> 40:25.219
Uh, say...

40:25.306 --> 40:27.536
You mind if I slip it on for size?

40:27.626 --> 40:29.503
Help yourself, friend.

40:29.586 --> 40:31.781
OK. Don't mind if I do.

40:33.666 --> 40:36.134
How do you get the
consarned thing off, sonny?

40:36.226 --> 40:39.024
Glad you brought that up, friend.

40:39.106 --> 40:42.064
To remove it, simply place
the strap between your teeth...

40:42.146 --> 40:43.818
Like this?

40:43.906 --> 40:47.023
Correct, friend. Now bite hard.

40:47.106 --> 40:48.824
You see?

40:48.906 --> 40:50.862
It's off.

40:50.946 --> 40:53.414
Say, that is simple.

40:53.506 --> 40:55.736
Well, friend,
we'll be on our way now, so...

40:55.826 --> 40:59.455
Uh-uh. Not so fast now, sonny...

40:59.546 --> 41:02.219
I'll have to make certain
it's satisfactory

41:02.306 --> 41:04.615
before we settle on a price.

41:04.706 --> 41:06.458
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.

41:06.546 --> 41:07.535
You can keep it.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.615
I can, eh?

41:09.706 --> 41:10.775
I can?

41:10.866 --> 41:13.300
Uh-huh. It's a free sample.

41:14.546 --> 41:16.776
Well, thanks a lot.

41:16.866 --> 41:19.824
[chuckles] Thanks ever so...

41:35.826 --> 41:36.975
Say!

41:37.066 --> 41:39.864
It works swell.

41:43.026 --> 41:45.699
[Lady] But when she put
that horrible muzzle on me...

41:45.786 --> 41:48.346
Say no more. I get the whole picture.

41:48.426 --> 41:50.064
Aunts. Cats. Muzzles.

41:50.146 --> 41:53.775
Well, that's what comes of tying
yourself down to one family.

41:53.866 --> 41:55.299
Haven't you a family?

41:55.386 --> 41:56.865
One for every day of the week.

41:56.946 --> 41:59.744
The point is, none of them have me.

41:59.826 --> 42:02.294
I'm afraid I don't understand.

42:02.386 --> 42:03.375
It's simple.

42:03.466 --> 42:04.945
You see... [sniffing]

42:05.026 --> 42:07.335
Hey. [sniffing]

42:08.506 --> 42:10.542
Something tells me it's suppertime.

42:10.626 --> 42:12.856
Come on. I'll show you what I mean.

42:15.186 --> 42:16.619
Now take the Schultzes here.

42:16.706 --> 42:17.695
Little Fritzie,

42:17.786 --> 42:19.219
that's me, Pige,

42:19.306 --> 42:20.978
makes this his Monday home.

42:21.066 --> 42:23.022
- Monday home?
- <i>Ach, ja.</i>

42:23.106 --> 42:25.336
[with German accent]
Monday is Mama Schultz

42:25.426 --> 42:27.064
cooking <i>der Wiener Schnitzel.</i>

42:27.146 --> 42:28.545
Mmm.

42:28.626 --> 42:30.218
Delicious.

42:30.306 --> 42:32.900
[Irish accent] O'Brien's
is where little Mike,

42:32.986 --> 42:34.977
that's me again, Pige,

42:35.066 --> 42:37.944
- comes every Tuesday.
- Every Tuesday?

42:38.026 --> 42:40.176
Begorra. And that's when they're havin'

42:40.266 --> 42:42.700
their darlin' corned beef.

42:42.786 --> 42:44.378
You see, Pige,

42:44.466 --> 42:46.661
when you're footloose and collar-free,

42:46.746 --> 42:49.863
well, you take nothing but the best.

42:49.946 --> 42:52.141
- [singing in Italian]
- Hey!

42:52.226 --> 42:53.261
Tony's!

42:53.346 --> 42:54.825
Of course.

42:54.906 --> 42:57.545
The very place
for a very special occasion.

42:59.986 --> 43:02.580
This way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.

43:07.506 --> 43:08.780
Wait here.

43:11.986 --> 43:14.739
Just one minute. I'm a-comin'. I'm...

43:14.826 --> 43:17.898
What's a-matter? Somebody's
a-makin' da April Fool with...

43:17.986 --> 43:19.465
[barking]

43:19.546 --> 43:21.662
Oh, hello, Butch.

43:21.746 --> 43:23.384
Where you been so long?

43:23.466 --> 43:25.502
Hey, Joe, look who's here.

43:25.586 --> 43:28.578
Well, what do you know? It's Butch.

43:28.666 --> 43:30.782
Hey, hey, hey!

43:30.866 --> 43:34.063
Joe, bring some bones
for Butchy before he eat me up.

43:34.146 --> 43:36.023
- [chuckling]
- OK, Tony. OK.

43:36.106 --> 43:37.585
Bones a-coming up.

43:37.666 --> 43:38.940
[barking]

43:40.866 --> 43:42.060
Huh?

43:42.146 --> 43:43.659
Ahh!

43:43.746 --> 43:45.896
What's this?

43:45.986 --> 43:47.624
Hey, Joe, look.

43:47.706 --> 43:49.617
Butchy, he's got a new girlfriend.

43:49.706 --> 43:51.503
Well, a son of a gun!

43:51.586 --> 43:53.542
He's a got a cockerel Spanish a-girl.

43:54.866 --> 43:58.176
Hey, she's a pretty sweet kiddo, Butch.

43:58.266 --> 44:01.736
You take-a Tony's advice
and a-settle down with this-a one, eh?

44:04.146 --> 44:05.545
"This a-one"?

44:05.626 --> 44:07.218
This one. This... Oh!

44:07.306 --> 44:08.978
Tony, you know.

44:09.066 --> 44:11.421
He's a-not a-speaking
English a-pretty good.

44:11.506 --> 44:12.939
[chuckles, clears throat]

44:13.026 --> 44:16.223
Now, first we fix-a the table.

44:16.306 --> 44:20.185
- Here's your bones, Tony.
- OK, bones. Bones?

44:20.266 --> 44:23.383
[Tony] What's the matter with you,
Joe? I break-a your face.

44:23.466 --> 44:26.538
Tonight, Butch,
he gets the best in the house.

44:26.626 --> 44:28.264
[Joe] OK, Tony, you're the boss.

44:28.346 --> 44:30.143
Now, tell me, what's your pleasure?

44:30.226 --> 44:32.535
A la carte? Dinner?

44:32.626 --> 44:34.218
[barking]

44:34.306 --> 44:35.898
A-ha. OK.

44:35.986 --> 44:37.578
Hey, Joe.

44:37.666 --> 44:38.735
Butch-a, he says

44:38.826 --> 44:42.341
he wants-a two spaghetti speciale.

44:42.426 --> 44:44.337
Heavy on the meats-a ball.

44:44.426 --> 44:46.303
Tony, dogs don't talk.

44:46.386 --> 44:49.617
- He's a-talkin' to me!
- OK, he's a-talkin' to you.

44:49.706 --> 44:50.855
You the boss.

44:50.946 --> 44:53.506
<i>Mamma mia.</i> [grumbling in Italian]

44:54.786 --> 44:56.265

[rooster crowing]

47:57.586 --> 47:59.816
Oh! Oh, dear.

48:01.266 --> 48:02.665
Is something wrong, Pige?

48:02.746 --> 48:05.658
- It's morning.
- Yeah. [stretches]

48:06.946 --> 48:08.265
So it is.

48:08.346 --> 48:10.302
I should have been home hours ago.

48:10.386 --> 48:12.502
Why? Because you still believe in that,

48:12.586 --> 48:15.419
"in the faithful old dog tray" routine?

48:16.866 --> 48:18.663
Aw, come on, Pige.

48:18.746 --> 48:20.338
Open up your eyes.

48:20.426 --> 48:21.745
Open my eyes?

48:21.826 --> 48:23.976
To what a dog's life can really be.

48:24.066 --> 48:25.704
I'll show you what I mean.

48:28.946 --> 48:30.823
Look down there.
Tell me what you see.

48:33.626 --> 48:36.698
Well, I see nice homes

48:36.786 --> 48:38.856
with yards and fences.

48:38.946 --> 48:42.018
Exactly. Life on a leash.

48:42.106 --> 48:43.664
Look again, Pige.

48:45.666 --> 48:48.260
[Tramp] There's a great
big hunk of world down there

48:48.346 --> 48:50.576
with no fence around it.

48:50.666 --> 48:53.738
Where two dogs can find
adventure and excitement.

48:53.826 --> 48:55.657
And beyond those distant hills,

48:55.746 --> 48:59.136
who knows what wonderful experiences?

48:59.226 --> 49:01.820
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.

49:02.666 --> 49:04.145
It's all ours.

49:06.226 --> 49:07.705
It sounds wonderful.

49:07.786 --> 49:09.504
But?

49:11.146 --> 49:12.704
But who'd watch over the baby?

49:18.506 --> 49:20.098
You win.

49:20.186 --> 49:21.414
Come on.

49:21.506 --> 49:23.019
I'll take you home.

49:29.626 --> 49:31.901
[man whistling]

[humming]
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

49:41.066 --> 49:43.261
<i>And they call it...</i>

49:43.346 --> 49:45.177
[chickens clucking]

49:46.746 --> 49:48.862
[Tramp] Not to change
the subject, but...

49:49.706 --> 49:50.900
Ever chased chickens?

49:50.986 --> 49:52.499
I should say not!

49:52.586 --> 49:54.975
Oh, ho! Then you've never lived.

49:55.066 --> 49:56.863
- But we shouldn't.
- I know.

49:56.946 --> 49:58.777
That's what makes it fun.

49:59.986 --> 50:02.136
Aw, come on, kid.

50:02.226 --> 50:04.103
Start building some memories.

50:06.066 --> 50:08.057
But we... We won't hurt the chickens?

50:08.146 --> 50:09.659
Hurt 'em? No!

50:09.746 --> 50:11.816
[Tramp] We'll just stir 'em up a bit.

50:18.946 --> 50:21.619
[Tramp] Just look
at those fat, lazy biddies.

50:21.706 --> 50:23.662
Why, they should've
been up hours ago.

50:23.746 --> 50:25.577
[barking]

50:25.666 --> 50:26.940
[squawking]

50:34.986 --> 50:37.056
Some fun, eh, kid?

50:37.146 --> 50:39.455
[man] Hey, what's going on in there?

50:39.546 --> 50:41.025
- [gunshot]
- What's that?

50:41.106 --> 50:43.097
That's the signal to get going. Come on.

50:43.186 --> 50:45.142
[gunshots]

50:48.786 --> 50:51.778
- This is living, eh, kid?
- Is it?

50:52.706 --> 50:54.458
Come on, Pige. Follow me.

51:04.586 --> 51:08.579
You know, there's a little bit
of bird dog in all of us, eh, Pige?

51:08.666 --> 51:09.701
Pige? Pige?

51:11.586 --> 51:13.383
Pige? Where are you, Pige?

51:14.466 --> 51:15.694
Pige?

51:17.506 --> 51:18.621
[echoing] Pigeon?

51:20.786 --> 51:22.219
Oh, Pige!

51:29.146 --> 51:31.058
[dogs howling and barking]

51:35.346 --> 51:37.177
[howling mournful tune]

52:14.306 --> 52:17.298
[howling continues]

52:39.906 --> 52:41.976
[whimpering]

53:01.266 --> 53:03.336
[dog] Hey.
Hey, Dachsie, how we coming?

53:03.426 --> 53:05.701
Just one more chorus and we're out.

53:05.786 --> 53:07.936
OK. On a downbeat.

53:08.026 --> 53:10.859
- One, two...
- [clanking]

53:17.386 --> 53:19.502
[man] Put her in number four, Bill,

53:19.586 --> 53:22.976
- while I check her license.
- OK.

53:24.026 --> 53:25.778
[Bill] All right, baby, in here.

53:28.346 --> 53:31.816
Well, look yous guys,
Miss Park Avenue herself.

53:31.906 --> 53:33.225
[chuckles] Blimey.

53:33.306 --> 53:35.774
A regular bloomin' debutante.

53:35.866 --> 53:38.255
Yeah. And pipe the
crown jewel she's wearin'.

53:38.346 --> 53:40.496
Hey, whatcha in for, sweetheart?

53:40.586 --> 53:42.497
Putting fleas on the butler?

53:48.866 --> 53:52.017
All right, you guys. Lay off, will you?

53:52.106 --> 53:54.017
Aw, what's the matter, Peg?

53:54.106 --> 53:57.576
We was only havin'
a bit of sport, we was.

53:57.666 --> 54:00.385
Can't you see the poor kid's
scared enough already?

54:00.466 --> 54:03.663
Pay no attention,
my little <i>ochi chernye.</i>

54:03.746 --> 54:05.179
That's right, dearie.

54:05.266 --> 54:07.097
They don't mean no real harm.

54:07.186 --> 54:10.496
It's like Gorky says
in <i>Lower Depths,</i> quote:

54:10.586 --> 54:14.295
"Miserable being must find
more miserable being.

54:14.386 --> 54:16.377
Then he's happy."

54:16.466 --> 54:19.378
- Unquote.
- Boris is a philosopher.

54:19.466 --> 54:21.104
Besides, little <i>bublichki,</i>

54:21.186 --> 54:22.824
wearing license here,

54:22.906 --> 54:24.305
that is like waving,

54:24.386 --> 54:26.138
you should excuse the expression,

54:26.226 --> 54:28.296
red flag in front of bull.

54:28.386 --> 54:30.058
My license?

54:30.146 --> 54:31.420
But what's wrong with it?

54:31.506 --> 54:33.656
There ain't nothin' wrong
with it, dearie.

54:33.746 --> 54:35.862
Confidential, there's not one dog here

54:35.946 --> 54:39.177
who would not give left hind leg
for such a knick-knack.

54:39.266 --> 54:41.302
That's your passport to freedom, honey.

54:41.386 --> 54:42.819
- Without it...
- [clanking]

54:42.906 --> 54:45.898
Hey. Hey, yous guys, look.

54:45.986 --> 54:48.500
Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk.

54:51.586 --> 54:53.099
[Lady] Where is he taking him?

54:53.186 --> 54:56.098
[dog] Through the one-way door, sister.

54:59.626 --> 55:01.935
[door locking]

55:02.026 --> 55:04.586
You... You mean he's...

55:09.466 --> 55:11.024
Oh, well.

55:11.106 --> 55:13.461
A short life and a merry one.

55:13.546 --> 55:15.935
Yeah, that's what
the Tramp always says.

55:16.026 --> 55:18.062
- The Tramp?
- Now there's a bloke

55:18.146 --> 55:19.340
what never gets caught.

55:19.426 --> 55:22.259
He's given the slip
to every dogcatcher in this burg.

55:22.346 --> 55:23.984
You won't believe this, dearie,

55:24.066 --> 55:26.261
but no matter how tight a jam he's in,

55:26.346 --> 55:28.940
that Tramp always
finds some way out.

55:29.026 --> 55:31.176
I can quite easily believe that.

55:31.266 --> 55:33.336
Ah, but remember, my friends,

55:33.426 --> 55:35.894
even Tramp has his Achilles heel.

55:35.986 --> 55:39.103
Pardon me, amigo.
What is this "chilli heel"?

55:39.186 --> 55:41.381
Achilles heel, Pedro.

55:41.466 --> 55:44.219
This is meaning his, uh, weaknesses.

55:44.306 --> 55:47.104
Oh. Oh, the dames. Yeah.

55:47.186 --> 55:51.384
[chuckles] He has an eye
for a well-turned paw, he has.

55:51.466 --> 55:53.297
Let's see. There's been Lulu.

55:53.386 --> 55:54.660
[dog] Yeah, and Trixie.

55:54.746 --> 55:56.225
[Dachsie] <i>Und</i> Fifi.

55:56.306 --> 55:57.580
And my sister,

55:57.666 --> 55:59.975
Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua.

56:00.066 --> 56:01.215
I think.

56:01.306 --> 56:02.864
What a dog.

56:02.946 --> 56:05.380
Yeah. Tell us about it, Peg.

56:05.466 --> 56:07.934
What a dog!

56:08.026 --> 56:10.859
Peg used to be in
the Dog and Pony Follies.

56:10.946 --> 56:13.255

56:24.066 --> 56:28.105

<i>- He's a tramp</i>

<i>He gives you plenty of trouble</i>

56:55.586 --> 56:59.465
<i>I guess he's just a no-count pup</i>

56:59.546 --> 57:02.982
<i>But I wish that he were double</i>

57:10.426 --> 57:11.461
<i>Bum-bum-bum-ruff</i>

57:11.546 --> 57:13.502

57:13.586 --> 57:15.383
<i>He's a good one</i>

<i>And I wish that</i>
<i>I could travel his way</i>

57:20.306 --> 57:24.936
<i>Wish that I could travel his way</i>

57:25.026 --> 57:28.496
<i>Wish that I could travel his way</i>

57:31.906 --> 57:32.895
Yeah.

57:32.986 --> 57:34.624
But he never takes them serious.

57:34.706 --> 57:36.981
Ah, but someday

57:37.066 --> 57:39.978
he is meeting someone different.

57:40.066 --> 57:42.705
[Boris] Some delicate, fragile creature

57:42.786 --> 57:46.096
who's giving him a wish
to shelter and protect.

57:46.186 --> 57:49.542
Like Miss Park Avenue
here, eh, matey?

57:49.626 --> 57:51.582
Mm-hmm. Could be.

57:51.666 --> 57:54.897
- But when he does...
- Yeah. I'm way ahead of ya.

57:54.986 --> 57:57.454
Under the spell of true love...

57:57.546 --> 57:59.935
The poor chump grows careless...

58:00.026 --> 58:01.937
The Cossacks are picking him up...

58:02.026 --> 58:04.460
And it's curtains for the Tramp.

58:05.786 --> 58:06.901
[door opens]

58:06.986 --> 58:08.817
[man] It's the little cocker, Bill.

58:08.906 --> 58:11.374
- In number four.
- [Bill] OK.

58:12.786 --> 58:14.185
All right, baby.

58:14.266 --> 58:16.826
They've come to take you home.

58:16.906 --> 58:19.215
You're too nice a girl
to be in this place.

58:29.866 --> 58:31.185
Courage, man.

58:31.266 --> 58:32.494
Courage!

58:32.586 --> 58:33.735
But, uh...

58:33.826 --> 58:36.738
I've never even considered matrimony.

58:36.826 --> 58:38.225
Nor I.

58:38.306 --> 58:40.774
But no matter which of us she accepts,

58:40.866 --> 58:43.938
we'll always be the best of friends.

58:45.226 --> 58:46.420
Now remember,

58:46.506 --> 58:49.418
not a word about her
unfortunate experience.

58:49.506 --> 58:52.942
- We don't want to hurt her feelings.
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

58:53.866 --> 58:55.219
Lassie.

58:55.306 --> 58:58.662
Miss Lady, ma'am.

58:58.746 --> 59:01.738
Please, I don't want to see anybody.

59:01.826 --> 59:03.623
Now, now, lassie.

59:03.706 --> 59:05.856
Don't feel that way about it.

59:05.946 --> 59:08.176
Of course not, Miss Lady.

59:08.266 --> 59:11.781
Why, some of the finest people
I ever tracked down

59:11.866 --> 59:13.584
- were jailbirds.
- [Jock] Quiet!

59:13.666 --> 59:15.304
You great loony!

59:16.226 --> 59:17.739
Uh, please, lassie.

59:17.826 --> 59:20.579
We've come with a proposition.

59:20.666 --> 59:21.894
[Jock] For helpin' ya.

59:21.986 --> 59:24.261
Help me? What do you mean?

59:24.346 --> 59:25.779
Well, now...

59:25.866 --> 59:27.697
You see, lassie...

59:27.786 --> 59:30.664
Neither of us
is as young as we used to be.

59:30.746 --> 59:33.544
But we're still in the prime of life.

59:33.626 --> 59:34.615
Aye.

59:34.706 --> 59:38.221
And we've both got
very comfortable homes.

59:38.306 --> 59:40.900
[Trusty] That's right. Where we know

59:40.986 --> 59:44.103
you'll be welcome
and appreciated, Miss Lady.

59:44.186 --> 59:47.542
So... So, to come
directly to the point...

59:47.626 --> 59:48.661
[clears throat]

59:48.746 --> 59:50.577
If you could, uh,

59:50.666 --> 59:53.658
find it possible to, uh...

59:53.746 --> 59:55.543
To, uh...

59:55.626 --> 59:58.777
You're both very kind,
and I do appreciate it.

59:58.866 --> 01:00:00.982
- But...
- [Tramp] Oh, Pigeon.

01:00:01.066 --> 01:00:02.943
Oh, Pi...

01:00:03.026 --> 01:00:04.823
[Tramp] Oh! Oh, hi, boys.

01:00:08.346 --> 01:00:10.382
Anything new in the kennel club set?

01:00:10.466 --> 01:00:11.865
[chuckling]

01:00:14.626 --> 01:00:17.060
A little something
I picked up for you, Pige.

01:00:18.666 --> 01:00:20.224
Hmpf.

01:00:26.066 --> 01:00:28.341
Looks like I'm the one
that's in the doghouse.

01:00:28.426 --> 01:00:32.738
If this person
is annoying you, Miss Lady...

01:00:32.826 --> 01:00:35.624
We'll gladly throw the rascal out.

01:00:35.706 --> 01:00:38.174
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

01:00:38.266 --> 01:00:40.416
Very well, ma'am.

01:00:40.506 --> 01:00:43.304
You... You...

01:00:43.386 --> 01:00:44.660
...mongrel!

01:00:49.906 --> 01:00:51.544
Aw, come on, Pige.

01:00:52.506 --> 01:00:54.736
- It wasn't my fault.
- Hmpf.

01:00:56.026 --> 01:00:58.256
I thought you were
right behind me. Honest.

01:00:59.546 --> 01:01:01.776
When I heard they'd
taken you to the pound...

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:04.141
Don't even mention that horrible place.

01:01:04.226 --> 01:01:07.184
[sobbing] I was so embarrassed and...

01:01:07.266 --> 01:01:10.258
- And frightened.
- Oh, now, now.

01:01:10.346 --> 01:01:14.021
Who could ever harm
a cute little trick like you?

01:01:14.106 --> 01:01:15.983
[Lady] Trick? Trick!

01:01:16.066 --> 01:01:19.945
- That reminds me, who is Trixie?
- Trixie?

01:01:20.026 --> 01:01:22.665
And Lulu and Fifi
and Rosita Chiquita wh...

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:24.623
- Whatever her name is.
- Chiquita...

01:01:24.706 --> 01:01:26.697
Oh! Yes! Well, l-I...

01:01:26.786 --> 01:01:28.105
As far as I'm concerned,

01:01:28.186 --> 01:01:30.142
you needn't worry about your old heel.

01:01:30.226 --> 01:01:31.375
[stammering] My heel?

01:01:31.466 --> 01:01:33.582
I don't need you
to shelter and protect me.

01:01:33.666 --> 01:01:36.100
- But...
- If you grow careless, don't blame me.

01:01:36.186 --> 01:01:39.337
I don't care if the Cossacks
do pick you up! Goodbye.

01:01:40.386 --> 01:01:42.980
- And take this with you.
- [thunderclap]

01:01:45.346 --> 01:01:47.462
[Lady sobbing]

01:01:58.666 --> 01:02:00.145
[board banging]

01:02:06.866 --> 01:02:08.458
[thunderclap]

01:02:22.026 --> 01:02:23.903
[growling]

01:02:28.066 --> 01:02:29.704
[barking]

01:02:37.266 --> 01:02:39.461
[barking]

01:02:46.466 --> 01:02:48.343
Stop that.

01:02:51.066 --> 01:02:53.102
Hush, now, hush.

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:54.619
[barking continues]

01:02:57.266 --> 01:02:58.858
[Sarah] Stop that racket!

01:03:01.346 --> 01:03:02.540
[Tramp] What's wrong?

01:03:02.626 --> 01:03:04.298
- A rat!
- Where?

01:03:04.386 --> 01:03:06.536
Upstairs, in the baby's room!

01:03:06.626 --> 01:03:09.265
- How do I get in?
- The little door.

01:03:09.346 --> 01:03:10.574
On the porch.

01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:16.861
[thunderclap]

01:03:22.546 --> 01:03:24.025
[sniffing]

01:03:25.546 --> 01:03:27.218
[growling]

01:03:42.266 --> 01:03:44.222
[snarling]

01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:47.744
[barking]

01:04:00.186 --> 01:04:01.585
[squeaking]

01:04:21.986 --> 01:04:23.260
[squeaking]

01:04:24.466 --> 01:04:26.582
[baby crying]

01:04:28.066 --> 01:04:30.057
- [crashing]
- [squeaking]

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:33.299
[crying continues]

01:04:51.706 --> 01:04:53.776
[gasping] Merciful heavens!

01:04:53.866 --> 01:04:57.142
Oh! Oh, you poor little darling.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:05:00.536
No, no, no.
Thank goodness you're not hurt.

01:05:00.626 --> 01:05:03.424
You... You vicious brutes. Back!

01:05:03.506 --> 01:05:05.098
Get back!

01:05:05.186 --> 01:05:07.381
Go on! Get back!

01:05:07.466 --> 01:05:10.378
The pound. The pound, that's it.
I'll call the pound.

01:05:10.466 --> 01:05:13.299
[barking]

01:05:13.386 --> 01:05:15.661
Come here, you. Come here!

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:17.384
Come on, come on.

01:05:17.466 --> 01:05:19.457
Come along.
I'll call them this minute.

01:05:19.546 --> 01:05:20.535
[whimpering]

01:05:20.626 --> 01:05:22.742
I won't sleep
with that brute in the house.

01:05:26.466 --> 01:05:27.979
[barking]

01:05:28.066 --> 01:05:29.499
<i>[telephone ringing]</i>

01:05:30.266 --> 01:05:31.938
[Sarah] Hello? Hello!

01:05:32.026 --> 01:05:33.698
[whimpering]

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:39.578
I don't care if you
are alone there, young man.

01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:42.464
I insist you pick him up immediately.

01:05:47.146 --> 01:05:48.898
[bell rings]

01:05:50.386 --> 01:05:51.614
[Jim] Darling, look.

01:05:54.026 --> 01:05:57.257
[Sarah] If you want my advice
you'll destroy that animal at once.

01:05:57.346 --> 01:05:59.064
[man] Don't worry, ma'am.

01:05:59.146 --> 01:06:01.455
We've been after this one for months.

01:06:01.546 --> 01:06:03.343
We'll take care of him.

01:06:06.026 --> 01:06:09.302
- [Darling] What do you suppose?
- [Jim] What's going on here?

01:06:09.386 --> 01:06:11.297
[man] Just picking up a stray, mister.

01:06:11.386 --> 01:06:13.342
Come on, giddup. [whip cracks]

01:06:13.426 --> 01:06:14.859
Caught him attacking a baby.

01:06:14.946 --> 01:06:16.265
- [Jim] Heavens.
- My baby.

01:06:16.346 --> 01:06:17.620
[both] Aunt Sarah!

01:06:17.706 --> 01:06:19.856
[Darling] Aunt Sarah!

01:06:19.946 --> 01:06:21.459
[both] Aunt Sarah!

01:06:23.426 --> 01:06:25.337
I was certain he was no good

01:06:25.426 --> 01:06:27.656
the moment I first laid eyes on him.

01:06:27.746 --> 01:06:30.055
Yeah, but, uh...

01:06:30.146 --> 01:06:33.218
I never thought
he'd do a thing like that.

01:06:34.426 --> 01:06:36.781
[Sarah] I got there in time.
There they were...

01:06:36.866 --> 01:06:39.983
[Jim] I'm sure there must be
some mistake. Lady wouldn't...

01:06:40.066 --> 01:06:42.136
[barking]

01:06:42.226 --> 01:06:44.945
[Sarah] Watch out! That dog's loose.
Keep her away.

01:06:45.026 --> 01:06:47.335
[Jim] Nonsense.
She's trying to tell us something.

01:06:47.426 --> 01:06:49.815
- [barking continues]
- What is it, old girl?

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:52.501
What are you try...

01:06:52.586 --> 01:06:54.224
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.

01:06:54.306 --> 01:06:56.217
- [Darling] What is it?
- [Sarah gasps]

01:06:56.306 --> 01:06:57.625
[Sarah] Aaah! A rat!

01:06:57.706 --> 01:06:59.378
A rat?

01:06:59.466 --> 01:07:01.218
We should've known.

01:07:01.306 --> 01:07:04.298
I misjudged him.

01:07:04.386 --> 01:07:05.421
Badly.

01:07:05.506 --> 01:07:08.657
Come on. We got to stop that wagon.

01:07:08.746 --> 01:07:11.465
But man, we don't know
which way they've gone.

01:07:12.666 --> 01:07:14.463
We'll track 'em down.

01:07:14.546 --> 01:07:15.820
And then?

01:07:15.906 --> 01:07:17.259
We'll hold 'em.

01:07:17.346 --> 01:07:19.302
Hold 'em at bay.

01:07:31.226 --> 01:07:32.341
Now what?

01:07:32.426 --> 01:07:34.860
The scent. Follow the scent.

01:07:41.386 --> 01:07:43.377
Ach. Let's face it, man.

01:07:43.466 --> 01:07:46.856
We both know you've
lost your sense of smell.

01:07:57.546 --> 01:07:59.138
[howling]

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:06.338
[howling continues]

01:08:25.345 --> 01:08:26.984
[howling]

01:08:40.225 --> 01:08:42.216
[howling]

01:08:50.265 --> 01:08:52.018
- [man] Get out of here.
- [barking]

01:08:52.666 --> 01:08:53.939
Go on, get away.

01:08:54.026 --> 01:08:55.459
[barking]

01:08:59.265 --> 01:09:00.779
Easy. Go on, get away.

01:09:00.866 --> 01:09:02.618
Watch it now. Watch it!

01:09:04.386 --> 01:09:05.660
[horn honking]

01:09:07.586 --> 01:09:10.225
[crowd murmuring]

01:09:16.746 --> 01:09:18.064
Hi, Pige.

01:09:18.145 --> 01:09:20.376
[whimpering]

01:09:36.145 --> 01:09:38.136
[howling]

01:09:47.586 --> 01:09:50.100
[Jim] All right,
everybody, watch the birdy.

01:09:52.866 --> 01:09:54.663
[growling]

01:10:00.146 --> 01:10:02.376
- [squeaking]
- Steady, now.

01:10:04.026 --> 01:10:05.345
[Jim] Hold it.

01:10:06.426 --> 01:10:08.303
[coughing]

01:10:08.386 --> 01:10:10.661
I guess I used a little too much.

01:10:12.186 --> 01:10:13.301
Uh-oh.

01:10:13.386 --> 01:10:15.616
Darling, visitors.

01:10:15.706 --> 01:10:17.139
Visitors?

01:10:17.226 --> 01:10:19.262
[Darling] Why, it's Jock.

01:10:21.586 --> 01:10:23.542
[Jim] And good old Trusty.

01:10:23.626 --> 01:10:25.503
Careful now, man.

01:10:25.586 --> 01:10:28.146
Careful. It's a wee bit slippery.

01:10:28.226 --> 01:10:30.217
[Trusty] Yes, it is.

01:10:31.866 --> 01:10:33.777
[Jim] All right, boy. We'll let 'em in.

01:10:35.626 --> 01:10:37.457
No, no, not you, young man.

01:10:37.546 --> 01:10:38.979
You're going to take a nap.

01:10:39.066 --> 01:10:41.216
Well, Merry Christmas.

01:10:41.306 --> 01:10:43.945
Come in, come in.
If you'll just step into the parlour

01:10:44.026 --> 01:10:45.823
[Jim] I'll see about refreshments.

01:10:45.906 --> 01:10:49.262
Oh, darling, where did you
put the dog biscuits?

01:10:49.346 --> 01:10:51.337
The box Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.

01:10:51.426 --> 01:10:53.257
[Darling] In the kitchen, Jim dear.

01:10:53.346 --> 01:10:55.906
Oh, no doubt about it.

01:10:55.986 --> 01:10:58.295
They've got their mother's eyes.

01:11:00.106 --> 01:11:02.301
Aye. [chuckles]

01:11:04.146 --> 01:11:06.501
But there's a bit
of their father in them too.

01:11:08.506 --> 01:11:12.340
Well, and I see you finally
acquired a collar.

01:11:12.426 --> 01:11:14.781
Oh. Yes.

01:11:14.866 --> 01:11:16.822
Complete with license.

01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:19.466
Oh, yeah, a new collar.

01:11:19.546 --> 01:11:22.743
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.

01:11:23.506 --> 01:11:24.985
[Trusty] Trusty, I says,

01:11:25.066 --> 01:11:28.854
Trusty, somebody's wearing a new collar.

01:11:29.826 --> 01:11:33.216
'Course, my sense of smell

01:11:33.306 --> 01:11:35.456
is very highly developed.

01:11:35.546 --> 01:11:37.377
Runs in the family, you know.

01:11:37.466 --> 01:11:39.855
There'll be no livin'
with him from now on.

01:11:39.946 --> 01:11:44.383
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:47.902
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

01:11:47.986 --> 01:11:50.546
[all] No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.

01:11:50.626 --> 01:11:51.900
Huh?

01:11:51.986 --> 01:11:54.056
I haven't?

01:11:54.146 --> 01:11:56.057
Well, um...

01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:59.377
As Old Reliable used to say...

01:11:59.466 --> 01:12:01.218
He'd say, uh...

01:12:02.426 --> 01:12:04.462
He'd say... uh...

01:12:05.266 --> 01:12:07.018
Uh...

01:12:07.106 --> 01:12:08.459
Hmm.

01:12:08.546 --> 01:12:10.616
Doggone.

01:12:11.386 --> 01:12:12.865
You know,

01:12:12.946 --> 01:12:17.098
I clean forgot what
it was he used to say.

01:12:17.186 --> 01:12:19.097
[chuckling]

01:12:21.666 --> 01:12:25.978
<i>[chorus] Peace, my children</i>

01:12:26.066 --> 01:12:29.979
<i>Of good will</i>

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:34.422
