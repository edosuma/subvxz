25:14.066 --> 25:16.066

25:14.066 --> 25:16.066
Kill me! Do it!

25:16.166 --> 25:18.333
Dwayne, I'm going to dominate

25:16.166 --> 25:18.333
the competition,

25:18.433 --> 25:21.066
because I've been doing

25:18.433 --> 25:21.066
the repetitions in the gym.

25:21.166 --> 25:22.600
I'm getting the pump,

25:21.166 --> 25:22.600
and nobody else

25:22.700 --> 25:25.433
is getting the pump

25:22.700 --> 25:25.433
like I'm doing.

25:28.367 --> 25:29.834
I'm going to be a Titan!

25:47.633 --> 25:49.200
<i>of the tracks,</i>

25:49.300 --> 25:52.400

25:52.500 --> 25:54.400
<i>along a 60-foot rail,</i>

25:57.300 --> 26:00.633
[Liam]<i> By the end,</i>

25:57.300 --> 26:00.633
<i>you'll be pulling 600 pounds.</i>

26:00.734 --> 26:04.367

<i>to hook the anchor, and reel</i>

26:12.600 --> 26:14.467
[cheers and applause]

26:14.567 --> 26:16.467
All right, like these guys,

26:14.567 --> 26:16.467
I know what it's like

26:16.567 --> 26:18.633
to grow up

26:16.567 --> 26:18.633
in an athletic family.

26:18.734 --> 26:21.367
It's incredibly inspiring,

26:18.734 --> 26:21.367
but it's also challenging,

26:21.467 --> 26:23.667
because you can't help

26:21.467 --> 26:23.667
but compare yourself

26:23.767 --> 26:25.100
to those closest to you.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.433
And what I've learned

26:25.200 --> 26:27.433
is that when it's game time,

26:27.533 --> 26:28.667
it's not about your roots.

26:28.767 --> 26:30.367
It's all about

26:28.767 --> 26:30.367
what's in front of you.

26:30.467 --> 26:34.033
<i>So, Kyle and Matt,</i>

27:11.867 --> 27:13.934
[Alex]<i> Oh, Kyle sent</i>

<i>He's going</i>

27:21.834 --> 27:23.767
<i>for the shorter throws</i>

27:23.867 --> 27:25.867
<i>and the shorter pulls.</i>

27:25.967 --> 27:27.300
Nice.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.000
[Liam]<i> The shorter throws</i>

27:27.400 --> 27:29.000

28:33.967 --> 28:36.567
[Alex]<i> This race was</i>

28:36.667 --> 28:38.233

Kyle, how are you feeling?

28:56.600 --> 28:58.300
I couldn't be

29:02.000 --> 29:04.300

29:02.000 --> 29:04.300

29:04.400 --> 29:06.000
Tyler, how do you feel?

29:06.100 --> 29:08.166
Your brother is giving you

29:06.100 --> 29:08.166
major props.

29:08.266 --> 29:09.467
You know,

29:08.266 --> 29:09.467
I'm very glad I got

29:09.567 --> 29:11.867
to share

29:09.567 --> 29:11.867
this experience with him.

29:11.967 --> 29:15.667
And, you know, I'm going to,

29:11.967 --> 29:15.667
you know, work my butt off

29:15.767 --> 29:17.200

29:17.300 --> 29:19.700
[Cari] You're going to

Congratulations. You're going

29:19.800 --> 29:21.433
to Mount Olympus,

29:21.533 --> 29:23.266
but more importantly,

29:21.533 --> 29:23.266
you guys love each other.

29:23.367 --> 29:25.867
-Brotherly love.

29:23.367 --> 29:25.867
-Those are some good boys.

29:28.867 --> 29:30.467

You're gonna kill this.

[dramatic music]

29:38.834 --> 29:41.467
Earlier tonight,

29:38.834 --> 29:41.467
four athletes persevered

29:41.567 --> 29:44.300
through physical grit

29:41.567 --> 29:44.300
and sheer determination.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.166
But to actually become a Titan,

29:46.266 --> 29:48.066
you need to conquer

29:46.266 --> 29:48.066
this monster.

29:48.166 --> 29:50.400
It's seven grueling

29:48.166 --> 29:50.400
physical trials

29:50.500 --> 29:52.367
that can propel you

29:50.500 --> 29:52.367
to greatness.

29:52.467 --> 29:54.767
Two more athletes

29:52.467 --> 29:54.767
are about to face off.

29:54.867 --> 29:57.767
It's the NASCAR trailblazer,

29:54.867 --> 29:57.767
Brehanna Daniels,

29:57.867 --> 30:01.567
and the unstoppable

29:57.867 --> 30:01.567
swim coach, Jackie Wood.

30:01.667 --> 30:03.667
Now, neither of your wins

30:01.667 --> 30:03.667
came easy,

30:03.767 --> 30:05.300
and it's not going to get

30:03.767 --> 30:05.300
any easier.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.200
Mount Olympus is unforgiving.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.200
You both know that.

30:08.300 --> 30:09.800
But I know you're

30:08.300 --> 30:09.800
going to dig deep,

30:09.900 --> 30:12.200
fight through your fatigue,

30:09.900 --> 30:12.200
and hold nothing back.

30:12.300 --> 30:16.000
So, Brehanna, Jackie,

30:12.300 --> 30:16.000
it's time to get to work.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.200

38:16.734 --> 38:18.967
[Liam]<i> And now</i>

38:16.734 --> 38:18.967
<i>it's The Descent.</i>

38:19.066 --> 38:20.033
<i>There are three walls--</i>

38:20.133 --> 38:22.667
<i>five feet, six feet,</i>

38:20.133 --> 38:22.667
<i>and seven feet.</i>

38:22.767 --> 38:25.800
<i>Tyler needs to keep pushing,</i>

38:22.767 --> 38:25.800
<i>because with Matt's strength,</i>

38:25.900 --> 38:28.400
<i>you know he'll have plenty</i>

38:25.900 --> 38:28.400
<i>of power for that crank.</i>

38:28.500 --> 38:29.700
[grunts]

38:29.800 --> 38:31.133
Tyler, get down here. Come on.

38:32.934 --> 38:36.000
[Alex]<i> Tyler Lucas</i>

38:32.934 --> 38:36.000
<i>flew 6,000 miles</i>

38:36.100 --> 38:37.433
<i>from Germany to be here.</i>

38:37.533 --> 38:42.100
<i>Flying like the Air Force</i>

38:37.533 --> 38:42.100
<i>down Mount Olympus.</i>

38:42.200 --> 38:45.600
<i>And his next stop's</i>

38:42.200 --> 38:45.600
<i>the Ball and Chain.</i>

38:45.700 --> 38:47.567
Come on, bro! Let's go!

38:47.667 --> 38:49.767
<i>He wants some payback</i>

38:47.667 --> 38:49.767
<i>for his brother's defeat.</i>

38:49.867 --> 38:51.200
<i>He's not done yet.</i>

38:51.300 --> 38:53.066
<i>Look at that.</i>

38:51.300 --> 38:53.066
<i>Look at that strength!</i>

38:53.166 --> 38:56.700
[Liam]<i> 250 pounds,</i>

38:53.166 --> 38:56.700
<i>and Tyler is backing it up.</i>

38:56.800 --> 38:58.700
<i>He was a college quarterback.</i>

38:58.800 --> 39:01.200
<i>You know</i>

38:58.800 --> 39:01.200
<i>those arms have power.</i>

39:02.266 --> 39:04.066
Come on, Tyler.

39:04.166 --> 39:05.633
Come on.

39:05.734 --> 39:07.467

39:08.900 --> 39:11.333
-[Alex]<i> Here comes Matt.</i>

39:08.900 --> 39:11.333
-Go, Matt! Go, go, go!

39:11.433 --> 39:14.900
<i>If he doesn't get down there,</i>

39:11.433 --> 39:14.900
<i>it's</i> hasta la vista,<i> baby!</i>

39:15.000 --> 39:16.800
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

39:16.900 --> 39:20.166
[Liam]<i> Tyler Lucas,</i>

39:16.900 --> 39:20.166

39:22.667 --> 39:24.700
[Alex]<i> Matt's making his way</i>

39:22.667 --> 39:24.700
<i>down the mountain,</i>

39:24.800 --> 39:28.100
<i>-but Tyler has broken through.</i>

39:24.800 --> 39:28.100
-Let's go, Tyler! Come on.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.266
<i>He wanted to avenge</i>

39:28.200 --> 39:30.266
<i>his brother.</i>

39:30.367 --> 39:34.867
<i>He wanted to be the one Lucas</i>

39:30.367 --> 39:34.867
<i>to reign over them all.</i>

39:36.900 --> 39:41.533
<i>Ladies and gentleman,</i>

39:36.900 --> 39:41.533
<i>Tyler Lucas is your Titan!</i>

39:41.633 --> 39:44.266
[cheers and applause]

39:44.367 --> 39:46.033

40:09.166 --> 40:10.667
<i>hoping to beat his brother.</i>

40:10.767 --> 40:13.734
<i>Instead he got to defend</i>

<i>his family's honor.</i>

40:13.834 --> 40:17.033
[Liam]<i> The little bro gets the</i>
