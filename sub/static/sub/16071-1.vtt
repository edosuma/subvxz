04:20.260 --> 04:23.730

with extraordinary results.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.947

has the best scores in the country.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.611
I think you should give
each and every one of yourselves

a round of applause
for this extraordinary accomplishment.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.737
Happy to have the company
of my old friend.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.423
Attractive, huh?

07:40.418 --> 07:42.716
Yes, very.

07:43.672 --> 07:46.926
So what's it been now, Robert, hmm?

07:46.925 --> 07:49.519
Three years? Four?

07:51.429 --> 07:53.648
It's been four years today, actually.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.519
Look around, my friend.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.734
If you wanted to,

08:00.730 --> 08:04.075
you could go home
with a different one every night.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.035
It's not exactly my style,
you know that.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.792
Ah, you're still punishing yourself

08:16.496 --> 08:18.874
about the accident, are you?

08:19.249 --> 08:21.593
Oh, Robert, you need to
deal with it, my friend.

08:21.584 --> 08:25.088
I know what carrying that kind
of burden around can do to you.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.512
I appreciate your concern as always,

08:28.508 --> 08:31.853
but as long as I stay here
in Eastern Europe,

08:31.845 --> 08:34.849
all of that stays back in New York.
Out of sight, out of mind.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.350
Well, that's...

08:37.142 --> 08:39.440
It doesn't work that way, my friend.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.562
I think you need therapy.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.482
I'll tell you what I do need.
I need a drink.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.975
I'm okay.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.478
Good.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.731
Any more memory lapses, hmm?

10:48.898 --> 10:50.445
Any more bad dreams?

10:53.695 --> 10:56.915
I sense that you're
avoiding conversation today.

11:02.328 --> 11:06.333
Perhaps you'll indulge me
in a brief activity, hmm?

11:14.257 --> 11:19.809
It's a hypnotic technique we use
to open a patient's senses,

11:19.804 --> 11:22.102
to tap into the imagination.

11:23.266 --> 11:27.021
It's really quite harmless.
You can trust me.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.610
You're not afraid of a simple
little blindfold, are you?

11:30.899 --> 11:33.618
You can remove it
whenever you want to.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.032
I promise.

11:40.742 --> 11:45.919
And just relax.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.713
Breathe and relax.

11:50.710 --> 11:55.056
Now, I asked you about your dreams.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.770
Any recently that you recall?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.062
Yes, one.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.689
Go on.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.815
It's embarrassing, actually.

12:13.608 --> 12:17.738
It's like a re-creation
from something I read long ago.

12:18.947 --> 12:22.417
<i>Have you read Hubert Selby, Jr.,</i>
<i>Last Exit to Brooklyn?</i>

12:22.408 --> 12:24.661
No, I can't say I have.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.670
There is this part at the end

12:29.666 --> 12:35.423
where this junkie chick
climbs into an abandoned car

12:36.464 --> 12:39.092
and lets every guy
in the neighborhood screw her.

12:39.092 --> 12:45.896
Every scumbag and lowlife
for miles around get in this line,

12:45.890 --> 12:48.609
and the line
goes around the block.

12:48.601 --> 12:52.356
How did it affect you, the scene,
when you read it?

12:53.564 --> 12:56.659
At the time, it was disturbing.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.573
But in this dream...

13:06.786 --> 13:09.460
I'm the girl in the abandoned car.

13:11.332 --> 13:14.427
I can never see their faces.

13:14.419 --> 13:19.300
They're hidden by keffiyehs,

13:19.299 --> 13:23.270
you know, those Arabic scarves.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.730
They're pulled over their faces,

13:25.722 --> 13:28.475
and every one of those men...

13:29.309 --> 13:30.561
Go on.

13:31.602 --> 13:32.819
They're all the same man.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.274
Have you thought who he might be...

13:38.526 --> 13:40.779

13:56.044 --> 13:57.546
You blanked out there.

13:57.545 --> 14:02.176

as you answered my questions.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.802
I did?

14:04.469 --> 14:05.686
Answered your questions?

14:08.181 --> 14:10.479
What questions?
What did I say?

14:10.475 --> 14:13.775
Well, you were away
for several moments.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.189
You don't remember
what we were talking about?

14:19.108 --> 14:21.782

with us today then?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.483

16:49.967 --> 16:51.435
Well, I have to admit, sir,

16:51.427 --> 16:53.646
that your email did arouse my curiosity.

based here in the city, defunct now.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.741
Yes. Black ops.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.281
A lot of fuss in the press
about it here, though.

17:09.069 --> 17:12.994
Our agents were good guys,
really great.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.958
They've been able to infiltrate

17:14.951 --> 17:18.797
some of the best organized
terrorist-radical groups

17:18.788 --> 17:20.756
from New York to Madrid,

17:20.748 --> 17:23.422
and they were not able--

17:23.416 --> 17:26.590
not able to get into Sofia, ever.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.715
Not then, not now.

17:28.714 --> 17:33.345
I gotta talk to you about
what's going on with Sofia today.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.514
I thought it was dead in the water.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.062
Yeah. Seemed to be

17:38.891 --> 17:40.234
until yesterday.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.365
Yeah, I read about this this morning.

17:46.357 --> 17:51.409
Hmm. I've been on the phone all night
with the States dealing with this.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.624
Turns out Washington
knows all about the fella

17:54.615 --> 17:56.834

17:56.826 --> 17:59.750
He was a target
of highest priority for us,

17:59.745 --> 18:02.794
and we've never been able
to get anywhere near him.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.794
Oh, I guess the guys back home
are feeling some heat from higher up,

18:05.793 --> 18:09.138
and now they want to find out
exactly what's going on here.

18:09.130 --> 18:14.102
So I have been specifically instructed
to, quote, unquote, persuade you

18:14.093 --> 18:16.391
to take charge of
the investigation here.

18:16.387 --> 18:17.388
Why me?

18:17.388 --> 18:19.766
Because you are exemplary.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.517
- [scoffs]
- No, seriously.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.487
That's what your FBI friends called you.
They said you were exemplary.

18:24.478 --> 18:28.403
I've never had anybody say
I was exemplary in my whole life.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.234
Leaving law enforcement

18:30.234 --> 18:32.862
was a well-thought-out decision
on my part, ambassador.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.125
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.872
I know. They told me about that,
and I'm truly sorry.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.214
Come on.

18:43.205 --> 18:48.086
But it seems that the ramifications of this
are very big--politically, globally.

18:49.879 --> 18:55.136
See, these vigilantes have taken on
a whole string of high-profile targets,

18:55.134 --> 18:58.138

told me on the phone last night

18:58.137 --> 19:02.017
that they've been tracking for years
and could never get a look at.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.356
So now they need to know

19:04.352 --> 19:08.482
how come these vigilantes
can get inside when they can't?

19:09.148 --> 19:10.400
And who are they, these guys?

19:10.399 --> 19:13.027
And what do they know?
How do they know it?

19:13.027 --> 19:14.870
And why them, not us?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.535
What intel do we have?

19:16.530 --> 19:21.331
They tell me that some militant
is setting up safe houses.

19:21.327 --> 19:25.207
He doesn't know why,
but he knows they're here in villages.

full disclosure, everything.

law enforcement, you have it.

very well equipped.

it does have me a little bit curious
as to why.

Why don't you give me
your professional opinion?

a number of times,

29:48.912 --> 29:52.007

emboldened him and...

30:37.002 --> 30:38.675
variability.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.181
You're a slow starter, my friend,

30:49.181 --> 30:52.560
but I'll give you this:
you have impeccable taste.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.202
She's interested in you.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.492
- It's obvious.
- [scoffs]

31:07.741 --> 31:10.665
Robert, celibacy is for monks,
my friend,

31:10.660 --> 31:13.288
and I'm not convinced
it's very good for them, either.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.380
Look, it's not that I don't want
to meet somebody,

31:17.376 --> 31:18.878
I just...

31:20.003 --> 31:21.971
I don't want to lose somebody, either.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.384
I'm not suggesting you marry her.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.228
Anyway, these Eastern Bloc girls
can be trouble.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.972
No, just keep it short and sweet.

31:31.098 --> 31:34.068
Two dates, three maximum.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.398
There's definitely something about her.

31:39.398 --> 31:43.869
Well, go for it, my friend.

31:43.860 --> 31:47.581
You only live once, allegedly, right?

31:47.572 --> 31:50.246
What are you doing?
Where you going?

31:50.242 --> 31:51.744
Come on, don't leave me here.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.586
I'm sure I'm not even her type.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.706
Listen, Robert...

31:56.540 --> 32:01.137
I know that losing your wife
was tough, the worst.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.889
I'm going to ask you a question.
You don't have to answer it.

32:04.881 --> 32:09.057
Is it you're afraid
of losing another woman,

32:09.052 --> 32:12.272
or is it you don't think
you deserve to have one, hmm?

32:14.349 --> 32:16.522
I'll see you very soon, my friend.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.397
Very soon.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.903
[drums only]

33:40.852 --> 33:42.604
[Applause]

33:42.604 --> 33:44.777
Wait.

33:46.233 --> 33:48.201
You are stunning.

33:48.193 --> 33:51.743
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.742
Would you care to join me, miss?

33:54.741 --> 33:56.243
I'd love to.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.621
I'll go change.

34:04.209 --> 34:08.510
Your dancing is...

34:08.505 --> 34:11.554
It's extraordinary.
I've never seen anything like it.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.893
You're nice for an American.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.387
Thank you.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.313
[clears throat, sighs]

34:22.393 --> 34:24.146
Am I making you nervous?

34:24.145 --> 34:27.524
No, no, not at all.

34:27.524 --> 34:30.243
It's just that, um...

34:30.235 --> 34:34.489
you, uh".
you remind me of someone.

34:35.282 --> 34:37.626
Your wife perhaps back in America?

34:37.617 --> 34:39.460
Oh, this? No, no, no.

34:39.452 --> 34:41.750
I'm not married.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.418
Oh, divorced.

34:43.415 --> 34:46.840
Is it an American custom
to wear the ring of the ex-wife?

34:46.835 --> 34:50.135
No, no, no. I just wear it because, uh--

34:50.130 --> 34:51.005
Because you still love her?

34:52.924 --> 34:56.268
Wait. No, no, no.
You don't understand.

34:57.304 --> 34:58.521
Let me explain.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.639
Uh...

35:01.099 --> 35:04.194
Well, she, uh,
she died a few years ago.

35:05.353 --> 35:06.445
I'm sorry.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.985
No, no.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.238
I should go.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.280
No, no.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.577
Please tell me your name.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.163
Ursula.

35:20.785 --> 35:21.911
Ursula.

35:22.829 --> 35:23.876
I'm Robert.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.421
Nice to meet you, Robert.

35:26.416 --> 35:29.795
Well, look, I'd really love to see you again.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.671
Can I have your number?

35:43.475 --> 35:47.355
DR. KAHN: So you blanked out
completely, like last time?

35:47.354 --> 35:49.197
VICKI: Yes.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.863
Do you recall anything this time?

35:51.858 --> 35:53.326
Nothing.

35:53.318 --> 35:57.915
Well, think and tell me
what you do remember.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.580
It was a few days ago.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.293
I was in the kitchen.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.504
Mihail had left for work.

36:06.790 --> 36:10.385
The next thing I remember
it was night time.

36:10.377 --> 36:11.879
I'm in bed.

36:12.629 --> 36:15.178
I hadn't shown up for work all day.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.926
And you don't remember anything
that happened that day?

36:17.926 --> 36:20.145
Nothing.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.230
The next morning when I woke up,

36:22.222 --> 36:27.319
I was so exhausted,
I could hardly get out of bed.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.937
Are you still having the headaches?

36:31.940 --> 36:34.944
[screaming]

36:48.957 --> 36:51.301
Are you still having the headaches?

36:53.044 --> 36:53.920
Sometimes.

36:56.798 --> 37:00.177
- Have you heard of syncope?
- No.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.476
It's complete loss of consciousness,

37:04.305 --> 37:07.354
interruption of awareness
of one's self and surroundings.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.896
If you feel yourself blanking out
again, it's simple.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.190
Just take deep breaths.

37:13.523 --> 37:14.900
Deep breaths.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.527
All right.

37:24.868 --> 37:26.370
Mr. Diggs.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.001
A couple of people I want you to meet.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.759
Officer Aleksander Mulichev,
Officer Greg Ospasov.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.721
Sofia's best,
and they both speak English.

37:37.130 --> 37:40.384
[Speaking Bulgarian]

37:41.217 --> 37:43.060
Gregor Ospasov. A pleasure.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.271
Great to meet you.
Please call me Aleks.

37:46.347 --> 37:49.817
They're gonna give you all the help
that local law enforcement can provide.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.360
They're good guys-

37:51.352 --> 37:53.150
Trust them with your life.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.220
[Speaking Bulgarian]

38:23.384 --> 38:28.140
The deceased is an explosives expert,
affiliated with Islamic Jihad.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.482
Of course.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.818
The killer shot the dog, also.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.939
This is the 12th connected killing
you've seen in six months?

38:34.938 --> 38:36.940
Yeah, that's right,

38:36.940 --> 38:39.068
and just one piece
of forensic evidence,

38:39.067 --> 38:42.537
a Romanian brand of cigarette butt
with lipstick

38:42.529 --> 38:44.998
was found on the sidewalk
near one of the killings.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.081
It could belong to anyone.

38:46.074 --> 38:50.580
There is also a melted VHS tape
from an Arabic souvenir shop.

38:52.247 --> 38:53.920
Completely clean. Untraceable.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.464
Unknown origin.

38:56.918 --> 39:00.092
DIGGS: So, now we've got
a long-range sniper killing.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.967
Any forensic evidence
at the shooter's post?

39:02.966 --> 39:05.389
Gunshot residue, hairs,
fibers, shells, anything?

39:05.385 --> 39:08.855
We're working on it.
Sifting the dirt.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.107
[Speaking Bulgarian]

39:36.332 --> 39:38.175
600 meters.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.883
Robert Diggs. U.S. Embassy.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.805
I'm gonna go take a look.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.500
Robert?

40:35.642 --> 40:37.895
Nah. If that were the case,

40:37.894 --> 40:41.364
the body would have wound up
somewhere over here in this proximity.

40:41.356 --> 40:44.610
No, the killer let him finish his prayer,

40:44.609 --> 40:47.112
and then hit when he stood up
and was just about to turn.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.738
That's why the body wound up here.

40:48.738 --> 40:51.457
So that means the shots
didn't come from there.

40:52.825 --> 40:54.418
They came from there.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.247
Huh?

41:22.397 --> 41:24.741
Hey, look at this.

41:26.526 --> 41:28.403
Marks from a rifle stand, huh?

41:49.173 --> 41:52.518
[Breathing heavily]

41:54.012 --> 41:57.016
[laughing]

42:13.948 --> 42:16.701
[bell chimes]

42:30.048 --> 42:33.518
[gasping]

43:16.177 --> 43:17.349
Vicki.

43:18.721 --> 43:20.723
[Speaking Bulgarian]

43:35.947 --> 43:38.291
[Speaking Bulgarian]

44:56.694 --> 44:57.695
Vicki...

45:27.183 --> 45:28.730
Oh, I completely understand.

45:28.726 --> 45:31.320
Hey, look, I'll have to
call you right back, okay?

45:32.355 --> 45:33.982
The printout you asked for.

45:36.359 --> 45:39.408
This is all they were able to retrieve
from the VHS tape?

45:39.403 --> 45:40.780
Sorry, it was too damaged.

45:42.156 --> 45:44.204
- Even with the enhancement?
- Even with.

45:50.790 --> 45:52.463
[Speaking Bulgarian]

45:58.547 --> 46:00.265
This just came in.

46:00.258 --> 46:01.760
We've gone international.

46:01.759 --> 46:04.603
The press picked on the Jinn murders.

46:04.595 --> 46:06.768
Son of a bitch.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.766
Have you seen this?

46:08.766 --> 46:10.268
It's not my fault.

46:10.268 --> 46:12.191
This was leaked by your friends back home.

46:12.186 --> 46:13.403
Sit down.

46:13.396 --> 46:15.023
I told them I thought they were nuts,

46:15.022 --> 46:16.945
but they said that they wanted
the world to know

46:16.941 --> 46:19.194
that they had their best man
on the case.

46:19.193 --> 46:20.445
With all due respect, sir,

46:20.444 --> 46:23.789
was there any thought given
to compromising the investigation?

46:23.781 --> 46:27.285
I'm a political appointee.
I have this job

46:27.285 --> 46:30.084
because I gave the president's
election committee a bag of money.

46:30.079 --> 46:31.752
I don't get to make decisions.

46:31.747 --> 46:34.500
They want this out there,
well, it's out there.

46:35.251 --> 46:37.094
The best case I can suggest is,

46:37.086 --> 46:39.760
maybe it'll rouse up a person of interest.
I don't know.

46:39.755 --> 46:41.098
They're desperate. I told you that.

46:41.090 --> 46:43.684
You think tipping our hand like this
is gonna help expedite that?

46:43.676 --> 46:46.850
Robert, I am the messenger.
Don't shoot me.

46:46.846 --> 46:50.100
They didn't like your fried videotape,
so they said they were going with this.

46:50.099 --> 46:52.477
I have car dealerships at home.

46:52.476 --> 46:54.023
I can get you a great deal on wheels,

46:54.020 --> 46:58.150
but I have to admit I'm a little bit
over my head on this stuff.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.243
Bulgaria was not the post I wanted.

47:00.234 --> 47:01.451
I was hoping for Paris.

47:01.444 --> 47:03.538
That's what they hinted at, Paris.

47:03.529 --> 47:05.873
Oh, maybe I didn't give them
enough money.

47:05.865 --> 47:07.867
I don't know. [sighs]

47:07.867 --> 47:10.996
Your guys want results, Robert.

47:10.995 --> 47:13.748
We are doing the best we can.

47:18.419 --> 47:19.762
[beep]

47:21.672 --> 47:24.471
DIGGS: That was a lucky find,
the art exhibit.

47:24.467 --> 47:26.515
URSULA: He's a local painter.

47:26.510 --> 47:29.514
Funny, I don't think I've ever
come across one before.

47:29.513 --> 47:32.266
Maybe you just haven't been
paying attention to what's around you.

47:32.266 --> 47:33.688
Maybe not.

47:36.771 --> 47:40.150
So what made you come to Sofia?

47:42.360 --> 47:44.988
Change of scenery, new opportunities,
that sort of thing.

47:46.989 --> 47:49.583
And you like your employer,
the government of the U.S.?

47:49.992 --> 47:52.871
[laughs] Yeah, fine.

47:52.870 --> 47:54.793
What about you?
You like what you do?

47:54.789 --> 47:56.086
I love it.

47:57.917 --> 48:00.636
I'd like to live in the mountains one day,

48:00.628 --> 48:02.380
away from the city.

48:24.568 --> 48:25.569
I have to go.

48:26.862 --> 48:29.331
Really? So soon?

48:29.323 --> 48:31.121
What time do you go on tonight?
I'd love to come and see you.

48:31.784 --> 48:32.660
No, not tonight.

48:33.744 --> 48:35.462
I'm sorry, Robert. I have to go.

48:38.332 --> 48:40.460
You're very nice, Robert.

48:40.459 --> 48:42.257
I'd like it if you call me.

48:43.379 --> 48:44.676
Okay, I will.

49:07.445 --> 49:11.325
MAN: Next target, Abdullah Said.

49:11.323 --> 49:14.793

50:08.005 --> 50:10.679
[frustrated sigh]

50:23.020 --> 50:24.363
[Exhales]

51:06.063 --> 51:07.531
Heh.

51:13.529 --> 51:15.202
Wait a minute.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.451
It's a bag.

51:20.077 --> 51:21.579
That's it.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.014
The last time we were together,

51:34.091 --> 51:38.562
you became agitated when I mentioned
your parents, remember?

51:39.888 --> 51:41.390
When I asked you if you missed them?

51:42.099 --> 51:43.021
Now...

51:45.185 --> 51:47.654
I want you to cast
your mind back, Vicki.

51:47.646 --> 51:50.741
I want you to think about
that little girl,

51:51.692 --> 51:55.822
what life was like for her
after her parents died.

52:20.387 --> 52:22.264
Aah!

52:28.771 --> 52:30.819
Aah!

52:34.151 --> 52:37.155
[screaming]

53:10.479 --> 53:17.112
Now... I'm going to ask you some questions
that may seem strange,

53:18.070 --> 53:21.620
but I want you to answer them
naturally, okay?

53:22.616 --> 53:26.871
Now, lie back, get comfortable.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.128
All right, good.

53:34.128 --> 53:38.474
And relax and breathe.

53:38.465 --> 53:40.217
Breathe.

53:40.217 --> 53:42.970
Will you take off your glasses, please?

53:53.021 --> 53:54.989
Tell me your full name.

53:56.066 --> 53:59.070
Victoria Denov.

53:59.069 --> 54:00.696
What year were you born in?

54:02.406 --> 54:06.377
1970s... Seventy-...

54:06.368 --> 54:09.838
'77, I think.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.920
What city were you born in?

54:14.543 --> 54:16.261
Sofia.

54:17.546 --> 54:21.301
No, Paris.

54:23.260 --> 54:24.432
Wait...

54:24.428 --> 54:26.647
