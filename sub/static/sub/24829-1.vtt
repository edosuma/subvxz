00:52.838 --> 00:55.503
They happily returned
to their peach pie.

00:55.505 --> 00:58.103
The three little pigs
lived happily ever after

00:58.105 --> 01:00.304
eating pea soup, sipping tea,

01:00.306 --> 01:02.403
and baking pies in
their brick house.

01:02.405 --> 01:03.206
The end.

01:03.904 --> 01:06.370
All right kiddo, time for bed.

01:06.372 --> 01:10.404
Mom, there's no such thing
as scary wolves, right?

01:10.406 --> 01:13.369
Well, wolves do exist, but
they're like big puppies,

01:13.371 --> 01:15.770
and there's not any around here.

01:15.772 --> 01:18.773
But is there such
thing as werewolves?

01:19.971 --> 01:22.936
Evan told me he saw
one in his backyard.

01:22.938 --> 01:24.836
You know Evan
just tells stories.

01:24.838 --> 01:26.337
Werewolves are just things

01:26.339 --> 01:29.370
that are in stories, hun,
I promise they're not real.

01:29.372 --> 01:30.739
Okay.

01:31.504 --> 01:33.370
Just don't worry about it.

01:33.372 --> 01:35.103
Okay.

01:35.105 --> 01:36.403
Goodnight, love you.

01:36.405 --> 01:37.439
I love you too.

01:40.371 --> 01:42.370
I just wanna keep the light on.

01:42.372 --> 01:43.837
Okay, well I'll just
be in the other room.

01:43.839 --> 01:44.672
Get some rest.

01:58.504 --> 02:01.036
No, it's not
real, it's not real.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.372
It's not real, it's not real.

02:09.005 --> 02:11.770
It's not real, it's not
real, it's not real.

04:20.105 --> 04:20.935
Shit.

04:28.838 --> 04:29.672
Hey, Ema.

04:30.605 --> 04:31.970
Kaci,
hey, how are you?

04:31.972 --> 04:33.336
Yeah, great.

04:33.338 --> 04:34.970
We still on for the
afternoon shoot?

04:34.972 --> 04:35.769
Of course.

04:35.771 --> 04:37.037
I was actually gonna ask

04:37.039 --> 04:38.873
if we could do it a
little bit earlier.

04:41.839 --> 04:43.036
How soon?

04:43.038 --> 04:44.335
How about I
come pick you up in an hour

04:44.337 --> 04:45.302
and we'll grab
some coffee before.

04:45.304 --> 04:46.772
Yeah, yeah, I can do that.

04:47.872 --> 04:49.837
Just text me when you get here.

04:49.839 --> 04:51.368
All
right, I'll see you soon.

04:51.370 --> 04:53.204
All right, later.

05:06.305 --> 05:07.937
Yeah, so I am so
sorry about changing

05:07.939 --> 05:09.137
the time of the appointment.

05:09.139 --> 05:10.936
I just kinda figured
the earlier the better?

05:10.938 --> 05:12.204
Oh no, you're fine.

05:12.206 --> 05:13.335
I actually have another
appointment around 3:00,

05:13.337 --> 05:14.903
so this kinda works out better.

05:14.905 --> 05:16.803
You're not shooting
other girls now are you?

05:16.805 --> 05:17.436
Oh no, it's a guy.

05:17.438 --> 05:18.271
Just one guy.

05:19.871 --> 05:20.702
Is everything okay?

05:20.704 --> 05:21.903
Yeah, it's just
a normal shadow.

05:21.905 --> 05:22.839
Oh, okay.

05:24.739 --> 05:27.503
So we'll just do two
shots here if you don't mind.

05:27.505 --> 05:30.136
All right, would you
like anything specific?

05:30.138 --> 05:31.836
Just
whatever feels right.

05:31.838 --> 05:32.838
All right.

05:33.939 --> 05:35.236
Good.

05:35.238 --> 05:36.072
Okay.

05:37.105 --> 05:38.769
Oh, there we go.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.872
- Smolder, smolder.
- Yeah.

05:42.939 --> 05:45.073
What's my motivation here?

05:46.238 --> 05:49.006
Something
a little fierce.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.803
Well, this is where I get off.

06:13.805 --> 06:16.903
Okay, do you have
any spare time?

06:16.905 --> 06:18.170
I'm not really sure, why?

06:18.172 --> 06:19.403
I don't know, I
just kinda thought

06:19.405 --> 06:21.672
we could go upstairs and
maybe get some coffee.

06:22.839 --> 06:24.903
Oh, yeah, that would be great.

06:24.905 --> 06:26.369
I just gotta get these photos

06:26.371 --> 06:28.769
edited before that
appointment, so.

06:28.771 --> 06:32.069
Okay, so I guess
I'll see you later?

06:32.071 --> 06:33.803
Yeah, yeah, I'll message you.

06:33.805 --> 06:34.438
Okay.

06:50.039 --> 06:51.369
Hey, Iris.

06:51.371 --> 06:53.938
Kaci, come here a sec.

06:56.105 --> 06:57.336
What's up?

06:57.338 --> 06:59.806
Was that the girl you
was tellin' me about?

07:00.905 --> 07:02.937
Hey are you
spying on me, Iris?

07:02.939 --> 07:04.135
Of course not.

07:04.137 --> 07:06.002
I happened to see you
talking in the car

07:06.004 --> 07:09.104
on the camera and I got curious.

07:09.106 --> 07:11.003
That's still spying.

07:11.005 --> 07:14.403
Spying, eavesdropping,
call it whatever you want.

07:14.405 --> 07:16.973
It's my property I
can do what I want.

07:18.204 --> 07:20.969
Well if you must
know, yes, that was her.

07:20.971 --> 07:22.770
And you
didn't invite her in?

07:22.772 --> 07:24.205
I'm just her photographer.

07:25.805 --> 07:28.269
Okay, I used to do a little
modeling when I was young.

07:28.271 --> 07:31.103
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah and my photographer

07:31.105 --> 07:35.003
always worked out this deal
with me where I would...

07:35.005 --> 07:36.470
Iris, that's probably a memory

07:36.472 --> 07:38.103
best kept up in the old noggin.

07:38.105 --> 07:40.368
I mean hung.

07:40.370 --> 07:41.972
That's great.

07:43.138 --> 07:45.368
With all that
said, how much would

07:45.370 --> 07:48.369
you charge me for a photo shoot?

07:48.371 --> 07:51.268
Um, yeah, are we done here?

07:51.270 --> 07:54.002
I'm just messin'
with you, kid.

07:54.004 --> 07:55.005
Are you doin' all right?

07:56.171 --> 07:58.436
Yeah, I just, I
got some work to do.

07:58.438 --> 08:02.037
I have to get these photos
edited by the end of this week.

08:02.039 --> 08:04.469
If you don't mind, maybe I
can come by sometime later

08:04.471 --> 08:06.736
and we can grab some
coffee or something.

08:06.738 --> 08:07.338
Sounds good.

08:08.339 --> 08:12.435
Oh, by the way, a few
peoples went missing.

08:12.437 --> 08:16.005
They don't know what's
going on, so be careful.

08:16.904 --> 08:18.071
Will do, thanks.

08:20.304 --> 08:23.872
Oh, he is such a
handsome little man.

08:29.504 --> 08:32.705
Ground
floor, going up.

08:52.872 --> 08:53.972
Second floor.

09:51.371 --> 09:52.968
Hello?

10:15.105 --> 10:17.837
No, please stop, please stop.

10:31.171 --> 10:32.001
Come in.

10:32.003 --> 10:32.837
Yes, thank you.

10:34.038 --> 10:35.302
Dude, did you
really just come here

10:35.304 --> 10:36.770
on your lunch break
to take a piss?

10:36.772 --> 10:37.406
Yup.

10:43.037 --> 10:44.335
So what you workin' on?

10:44.337 --> 10:48.005
Just some
photos that I took today.

10:50.304 --> 10:51.102
Those look pretty good, man.

10:51.104 --> 10:52.135
Thanks.

10:52.137 --> 10:53.202
So who's the girl?

10:53.204 --> 10:55.036
Oh she's just
a friend of mine.

10:55.038 --> 10:56.870
Are you gonna tell
me her name, or?

10:56.872 --> 10:58.503
Oh, her name's Ema.

10:58.505 --> 11:00.169
Dibs.

11:00.171 --> 11:01.035
What?

11:01.037 --> 11:02.336
I called dibs.

11:02.338 --> 11:03.736
You can't call
dibs on her dude,

11:03.738 --> 11:04.836
I called dibs on her
the first day I met her.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.470
Well was anyone there
whenever you called dibs?

11:07.472 --> 11:08.302
No.

11:08.304 --> 11:09.968
Then it doesn't count.

11:09.970 --> 11:10.935
Look, all right, no.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.103
She's just a girl, we're
not gonna call dibs...

11:13.105 --> 11:14.169
Okay, okay, okay.

11:14.171 --> 11:15.368
I'll take mine back then.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.672
All right, good.

11:17.971 --> 11:18.605
Ah, shit.

11:19.870 --> 11:21.102
What, what's going on?

11:21.104 --> 11:23.103
I got a doctors
appointment to go to.

11:23.105 --> 11:25.269
Well, I'll be here then.

11:25.271 --> 11:27.039
All right.

11:35.738 --> 11:36.369
See you later man.

11:36.371 --> 11:38.036
Later, bro.

11:38.038 --> 11:39.071
Shit.

11:40.204 --> 11:43.172
Wow, so you can go ahead
and take that home with ya.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.372
Have a nice appointment, man.

12:06.237 --> 12:08.869
Kaci, you're here early.

12:08.871 --> 12:11.005
Yeah, traffic wasn't
as bad as I thought.

12:13.171 --> 12:14.269
Kaci, you're here.

12:14.271 --> 12:16.368
That's great, how have you been?

12:16.370 --> 12:17.803
I've been great.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.068
I did a photo shoot today, so.

12:19.070 --> 12:19.938
That's perfect.

12:22.037 --> 12:23.269
So how do you like
working here so far?

12:23.271 --> 12:26.103
Oh, it's not as
bad as you'd think.

12:27.838 --> 12:30.202
And I've really enjoyed
having her work here too.

12:30.204 --> 12:31.203
I bet.

12:31.205 --> 12:32.136
Do you mind?

12:32.138 --> 12:33.068
Sure, of course.

12:33.070 --> 12:33.905
Follow me.

12:37.370 --> 12:38.871
Why don't you have a seat?

12:41.171 --> 12:44.769
So, she's cute.

12:44.771 --> 12:48.902
Yeah, she's more
than cute, my friend.

12:48.904 --> 12:51.236
So tell me about that
photo shoot today.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.336
Oh yeah, it was fine.

12:53.338 --> 12:55.203
I mean there's a few more
photos I would've liked

12:55.205 --> 12:57.836
to have gotten, but other
than that, it was okay.

12:57.838 --> 12:59.503
I assume she drove?

12:59.505 --> 13:01.001
Yeah.

13:01.003 --> 13:02.938
Did you invite her
into your apartment?

13:04.170 --> 13:05.335
No.

13:05.337 --> 13:07.303
You're actually the second
person today to ask me that.

13:07.305 --> 13:11.236
Hm, is there something
you're afraid of happening

13:11.238 --> 13:13.139
if you were to invite
somebody inside, or?

13:15.138 --> 13:16.736
I'm not really sure.

13:16.738 --> 13:19.772
Kaci,
you know the answer.

13:20.903 --> 13:21.738
Just tell me.

13:25.838 --> 13:29.103
I think that I'm afraid
of like once her and I are

13:29.105 --> 13:32.268
in this like private, enclosed
space that with her in it

13:32.270 --> 13:36.969
it's almost like I become
claustrophobic or something.

13:36.971 --> 13:39.205
Why don't you lay back
on the couch for me.

13:44.071 --> 13:46.135
Are you still having
the nightmares?

13:46.137 --> 13:48.737
Yeah, I had one
last night, actually.

13:49.771 --> 13:51.072
Have they changed any?

13:53.370 --> 13:55.168
This one was a lot different.

13:55.170 --> 13:58.303
This one was kind of a memory
from the night my mom died.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.303
Is the werewolf still
appearing in them?

14:00.305 --> 14:01.139
Yeah.

14:02.171 --> 14:03.435
Okay.

14:03.437 --> 14:05.672
Has the appearance of
the wolf changed any?

14:08.037 --> 14:09.270
A little bit.

14:09.272 --> 14:12.769
His fur's still jet black and
his eyes are like wide open

14:12.771 --> 14:17.002
but you can't really see 'em,
and his mouth is open wide

14:17.004 --> 14:19.902
and doesn't really
ever change that much.

14:19.904 --> 14:22.802
So sort of like
resting bitch face?

14:22.804 --> 14:26.406
Right, or resting wolf
face or whatever, I guess.

14:27.504 --> 14:28.435
I have a question.

14:28.437 --> 14:29.271
Shoot.

14:30.937 --> 14:33.369
What do you think wolves
are symbolizing in dreams?

14:33.371 --> 14:35.272
That's a really
good question, Kaci.

14:36.404 --> 14:39.235
Some scholars agree
that werewolves

14:39.237 --> 14:44.238
or wolves in particular
symbolize a fear of evil

14:45.370 --> 14:48.168
or controlling or
confronting your fear.

14:48.170 --> 14:50.935
However, this may or may
not make a difference,

14:50.937 --> 14:53.336
but your dreams and nightmares

14:53.338 --> 14:56.269
focus mostly on a
werewolf, am I right?

14:56.271 --> 14:57.705
- Right.
- Okay.

15:00.071 --> 15:01.069
Then I don't know.

15:01.071 --> 15:02.470
I really don't know.

15:02.472 --> 15:05.368
Now, take this worth
a grain of salt,

15:05.370 --> 15:10.371
but, your dreams with werewolves
may symbolize the fear that

15:12.104 --> 15:16.802
you have of losing control,
or transforming into a monster

15:16.804 --> 15:20.372
or changing into a person
that people are afraid of.

15:23.404 --> 15:25.071
Sounds about right.

15:48.171 --> 15:51.436
In other news, four people
went missing this past weekend;

15:51.438 --> 15:54.402
Rick Taylors and his wife,
Lisa, and their two kids,

15:54.404 --> 15:56.336
were all reported
missing Monday night.

15:56.338 --> 15:59.068
No further statements have
been made by local authorities,

15:59.070 --> 16:01.436
however, if you see
Rick and his family,

16:01.438 --> 16:04.135
please contact the Russell
County Police Department

16:04.137 --> 16:05.369
and we will keep you updated

16:05.371 --> 16:07.169
on this story as
much as possible.

16:07.171 --> 16:07.972
Thank you.

16:19.104 --> 16:19.937
Shit.

16:32.337 --> 16:33.438
We're done.

17:13.838 --> 17:15.069
I'll be damned.

17:15.070 --> 17:17.406
Hey, buddy, can you
move so I can get out?

17:30.471 --> 17:33.371
Matt, where are you?

17:38.003 --> 17:40.436
I think those homeless
guys are hangin'

17:40.438 --> 17:42.371
around the parking lot again.

17:46.437 --> 17:47.371
Thank you, bye.

18:14.471 --> 18:15.305
No.

18:16.370 --> 18:17.405
No.

18:19.804 --> 18:20.439
No.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.339
How was school today?

18:26.171 --> 18:27.139
It was all right.

18:28.139 --> 18:30.972
Yeah, are those kids
still picking on you?

18:32.471 --> 18:33.072
No.

18:35.871 --> 18:37.139
Are you tellin' the truth?

18:38.004 --> 18:39.735
No.

18:39.737 --> 18:40.636
What happened?

18:40.638 --> 18:43.872
Brandon punched,
shoved me into a locker

18:45.770 --> 18:49.468
and closed it
today during lunch.

18:49.470 --> 18:50.971
Where were the teachers?

18:51.838 --> 18:52.672
I don't know.

18:54.070 --> 18:56.268
I'm gonna have a talk with
the principals tomorrow,

18:56.270 --> 18:57.802
and we'll figure somethin' out.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.168
Does that sound good?

18:59.170 --> 19:00.005
Yes.

19:02.271 --> 19:05.001
Now when we get home I
need you to do your homework

19:05.003 --> 19:06.236
'cause I've gotta
go to the store

19:06.238 --> 19:07.401
and we're gonna buy
stuff for dinner.

19:07.403 --> 19:09.069
Okay.

19:09.071 --> 19:10.469
I'm makin' your favorite.

19:10.471 --> 19:12.036
Pizza rolls?

19:12.038 --> 19:13.402
No, not pizza rolls.

19:13.404 --> 19:14.434
Lasagna.

19:14.436 --> 19:16.071
- With garlic bread?
- Yup.

19:19.737 --> 19:20.371
Mom?

19:21.471 --> 19:22.501
What?

19:22.503 --> 19:23.837
Is that Sophie?

19:27.337 --> 19:28.704
Oh honey, turn your head.

19:32.404 --> 19:33.239
Mommy?

19:34.204 --> 19:36.035
Stay right there.

19:36.037 --> 19:37.836
Is it Sophie?

19:37.838 --> 19:38.672
Yes.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.135
Mom, look behind you!

19:47.470 --> 19:48.704
Mom!

21:52.037 --> 21:57.039
Kaci.

22:34.971 --> 22:37.005
How's my baby boy doin'?

22:38.938 --> 22:40.405
No, no, no, you're not real.

22:42.270 --> 22:43.935
Of course I'm real.

22:43.937 --> 22:46.270
Why would you do this to me?

22:48.004 --> 22:49.338
I did nothing.

22:51.138 --> 22:53.068
Yes, you did.

22:53.070 --> 22:58.072
Come here you little shit.

23:42.270 --> 23:44.802
I've got you, now
let me have my kiss.

24:06.071 --> 24:06.905
Shit.

24:23.871 --> 24:24.905
Come on, man.

24:36.904 --> 24:38.001
Hello?

24:38.003 --> 24:39.201
Hey man, where you at?

24:39.203 --> 24:42.270
Yeah, I'm
out with a model right now.

24:43.403 --> 24:44.535
What's up?

24:44.537 --> 24:46.367
I'm actually standing
out in front of your place.

24:46.369 --> 24:49.268
Do you have
anything else to do today?

24:49.270 --> 24:50.969
Nah.

24:50.971 --> 24:53.468
All right,
well, I'll be there in a few.

24:53.470 --> 24:56.068
All right, well I'll probably
go grab somethin' to eat.

24:56.070 --> 24:56.902
All right, man,

24:56.904 --> 24:58.268
I'll just see you
in a little bit.

24:58.270 --> 24:59.270
All right.

25:18.069 --> 25:19.936
Hey, Ema, right?

25:19.938 --> 25:22.401
Yeah, have we met?

25:22.403 --> 25:23.968
No, I'm Kaci's friend.

25:23.970 --> 25:25.301
I just recognize
you from the photos.

25:25.303 --> 25:26.367
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

25:26.369 --> 25:28.001
Is Kaci upstairs?

25:28.003 --> 25:30.936
Sadly not, I think he said
he's out with some model.

25:30.938 --> 25:31.972
Huh.

25:32.837 --> 25:34.002
What?

25:34.004 --> 25:34.868
It's nothing.

25:34.870 --> 25:35.835
It's just we've been
working together

25:35.837 --> 25:38.035
for over a year now
and as far as I know,

25:38.037 --> 25:39.401
I'm the only girl
he's ever worked with.

25:39.403 --> 25:41.901
He's told me you're his
only female client, too.

25:41.903 --> 25:44.836
Hm, well, do you
know which room he's in?

25:44.838 --> 25:46.201
You don't know what
apartment he's in?

25:46.203 --> 25:49.035
No, he's never invited me up.

25:49.037 --> 25:51.302
So you're here for a
surprise visit I'm guessing?

25:51.304 --> 25:52.901
Sort of.

25:52.903 --> 25:54.335
He's been acting
really weird lately,

25:54.337 --> 25:56.102
I just wanted to
check in on him.

25:56.104 --> 25:57.835
Yeah I
know what you mean.

25:57.837 --> 26:01.735
Well, I was gonna ask
inside which apartment number

26:01.737 --> 26:03.335
was his but there's
nobody in the office.

26:03.337 --> 26:06.000
For some reason Iris isn't
here today, I don't know why.

26:06.002 --> 26:07.067
Well, would you
like to go upstairs

26:07.069 --> 26:08.334
and do some investigating?

26:08.336 --> 26:09.837
How are we goin' get in?

26:12.504 --> 26:13.338
Any questions?

26:15.002 --> 26:15.838
Come on.

26:37.037 --> 26:39.235
He really likes to
paint, doesn't he?

26:39.237 --> 26:40.801
Yeah, that's kind
of what he does

26:40.803 --> 26:43.000
when he's not doin' photography.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.768
Does he make any
money off of these?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.736
He's actually made a
few grand off of a few.

26:46.738 --> 26:47.936
No shit?

26:47.938 --> 26:48.401
Yeah, I don't know
how he does it...

26:48.403 --> 26:50.135
That's crazy.

26:50.137 --> 26:51.405
What about you?

26:52.236 --> 26:53.268
What about me?

26:53.270 --> 26:54.434
What do you do?

26:54.436 --> 26:56.000
Oh, I'm a service writer.

26:56.002 --> 26:58.101
Had you pegged
for a grease monkey.

26:58.103 --> 26:59.302
It's that obvious, huh?

26:59.304 --> 27:00.769
No offense, but I can
smell the antifreeze

27:00.771 --> 27:01.905
and oil from over here.

27:27.036 --> 27:29.735
Um, what are you
guys doing here?

27:29.737 --> 27:31.035
Waitin'
on you to get back.

27:31.037 --> 27:32.071
And you?

27:33.404 --> 27:35.235
Am I supposed to have
a different answer?

27:35.237 --> 27:36.802
How'd you guys get in here?

27:36.804 --> 27:37.438
Lock pick.

27:38.370 --> 27:40.338
Yeah, 'cause that's
like not illegal.

27:47.902 --> 27:48.837
Why is she in here?

27:49.504 --> 27:50.335
What's wrong man?

27:50.337 --> 27:51.736
We're just hangin' out.

27:51.738 --> 27:52.469
I get that, but
why'd you let her in,

27:52.471 --> 27:53.401
you know I have anxiety about...

27:53.403 --> 27:54.502
She let herself in.

27:54.504 --> 27:56.304
Keep your voice down.

27:58.036 --> 27:59.301
Look dude, just hang out.

27:59.303 --> 28:01.035
We're just chillin'.

28:01.037 --> 28:02.868
Let's just get this
shit over with, all right?

28:02.870 --> 28:04.000
I have stuff to do

28:04.002 --> 28:05.201
- and this shit's
- All right, all right.

28:05.203 --> 28:06.269
gonna throw me
into a panic attack.

28:06.271 --> 28:07.202
Calm down, just
go in there and relax.

28:13.304 --> 28:16.068
Hey, I saw where you
finished editing those photos.

28:16.070 --> 28:19.968
Um, I'm sorry but, why
are you on my computer?

28:19.970 --> 28:20.871
Ah, I got bored.

28:21.770 --> 28:22.404
Right.

28:23.738 --> 28:26.034
Listen, do you
guys wanna go grab

28:26.036 --> 28:27.135
like a bite to eat or something?

28:27.137 --> 28:29.202
I'm just like really jittery
and nervous right now.

28:29.204 --> 28:30.867
Yeah, sure.

28:30.869 --> 28:32.102
But, first can I look at
the pictures you took today?

28:32.104 --> 28:33.067
What?

28:33.069 --> 28:34.201
The photos?

28:34.203 --> 28:35.334
You had a shoot today, right?

28:35.336 --> 28:37.167
Uh yeah, yeah,
but I would just

28:37.169 --> 28:39.402
like rather wait until
they were edited.

28:39.404 --> 28:40.834
I'm not gonna judge.

28:40.836 --> 28:43.235
Really I would
just like to wait.

28:43.237 --> 28:43.870
Please?

28:45.204 --> 28:46.904
- Just a few.
- Of course.

28:48.037 --> 28:48.871
Thanks.

28:57.337 --> 28:58.805
These are really good.

29:00.037 --> 29:03.502
Wait, wait, I thought you were
working with a model today.

29:03.504 --> 29:04.868
Didn't show up.

29:04.870 --> 29:05.870
Oh, how sad.

29:07.137 --> 29:09.000
All right, well do you guys
wanna go down to the pizzeria?

29:09.002 --> 29:09.934
I'll buy.

29:09.936 --> 29:10.868
You ain't gotta tell me twice.

29:10.870 --> 29:11.468
Actually, I'll buy.

29:11.470 --> 29:12.768
They deliver, right?

29:12.770 --> 29:14.800
I don't think they do.

29:14.802 --> 29:15.968
Yeah they do.

29:15.970 --> 29:18.134
I remember they delivered a
pizza here like last week.

29:18.136 --> 29:19.868
I guess that's right.

29:19.870 --> 29:21.171
Awesome, it's on me guys.

29:22.203 --> 29:23.203
Awesome.

29:24.236 --> 29:25.271
What?

29:30.403 --> 29:33.135
So, they're
like night terrors?

29:33.137 --> 29:34.268
Sort of.

29:34.270 --> 29:35.735
They're just either nightmares

29:35.737 --> 29:37.137
I had as a kid or
like bad memories.

29:38.270 --> 29:40.201
Well is there
like a common theme?

29:40.203 --> 29:42.401
- Yeah, a dog.
- A dog?

29:42.403 --> 29:45.202
A wolf, or a
werewolf, I guess.

29:45.204 --> 29:46.167
And you had one last night?

29:46.169 --> 29:47.235
- Nightmare?
- Yeah.

29:47.237 --> 29:49.201
- Yeah.
- What was it like?

29:49.203 --> 29:54.204
Um, it's kind of a nightmare
of the night my mom died.

29:55.104 --> 29:55.835
Oh, my God, what happened?

29:55.837 --> 29:56.835
Oh, it was...

29:56.837 --> 29:58.000
Oh, I am so sorry,

29:58.002 --> 29:59.235
that was such a fucking
rude thing to ask.

29:59.237 --> 30:00.967
- I shouldn't have said that.
- No, no, no.

30:00.969 --> 30:02.435
- You don't have to answer.
- You're good, you're good.

30:02.437 --> 30:05.135
When I was a kid my mom liked

30:05.137 --> 30:07.302
to take walks around
this lake that we had.

30:07.304 --> 30:08.134
Yeah.

30:08.136 --> 30:11.101
And one reason
she liked to do it

30:11.103 --> 30:14.001
was because she liked nature,
she liked to take walks,

30:14.003 --> 30:15.134
and also because
she didn't like me

30:15.136 --> 30:18.334
really watching TV that
much or playing video games,

30:18.336 --> 30:22.202
so while we're walking I see
this kind of like fur ball

30:22.204 --> 30:25.000
hiding behind a
tree and I realize

30:25.002 --> 30:27.070
it was the dog we
had at that time.

30:28.336 --> 30:32.835
And my mom goes to check on
it and it's our dead dog.

30:32.837 --> 30:34.202
And whenever she turned around

30:34.204 --> 30:37.134
this like gigantic wolf
crept up behind her

30:37.136 --> 30:38.967
and starting attacking
her and like mauling her.

30:38.969 --> 30:40.267
It was horrible.

30:40.269 --> 30:42.370
I can't get the
image out of my head.

30:44.037 --> 30:47.168
And yeah, it just drug her off
and there was no body found,

30:47.170 --> 30:50.734
no anything, and the whole
town just chalked it off

30:50.736 --> 30:54.735
to being a bear attack and
everybody just moved on.

30:54.737 --> 30:55.834
That's horrible.

30:55.836 --> 30:57.102
Right?

30:57.104 --> 30:58.834
I was just the boy
that cried wolf.

30:58.836 --> 31:00.170
Well, I believe you.

31:01.369 --> 31:03.367
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean, people are so

31:03.369 --> 31:05.402
quick to judge kids
and call them liars.

31:05.404 --> 31:08.235
I don't think a child could
make up a story like that.

31:08.237 --> 31:11.469
Yeah, I wish
everybody felt that way.

31:11.471 --> 31:13.434
I see people all the
time I knew as a kid,

31:13.436 --> 31:16.401
and when they see me, I
immediately know what they're

31:16.403 --> 31:19.370
thinking and I just wish
they could forget about it.

31:21.736 --> 31:22.469
Where have you been?

31:22.471 --> 31:24.267
Oh I had to go take a call.

31:24.269 --> 31:26.201
Oh, I see.

31:26.203 --> 31:27.368
Shit you guys, it's
gettin' pretty late.

31:27.370 --> 31:28.768
I better head to the house,

31:28.770 --> 31:30.001
I have to get up early
for work tomorrow.

31:30.003 --> 31:32.367
Yeah, I should
probably get going, too.

31:32.369 --> 31:34.402
All right, if you guys
are free this weekend

31:34.404 --> 31:36.401
it'd be cool to like
hangout or something.

31:36.403 --> 31:38.234
- Sounds good to me.
- Ditto.

31:38.236 --> 31:39.837
- All right, bro.
- See ya.

31:41.002 --> 31:41.837
Awesome.

31:43.803 --> 31:45.334
Bye, Kaci.

31:45.336 --> 31:46.371
See ya.

33:10.369 --> 33:11.270
Oh, shit.

33:14.204 --> 33:15.304
Bo, get your ass home.

33:16.503 --> 33:18.367
Go on.

33:18.369 --> 33:20.137
Scared the shit outta me.

33:22.003 --> 33:22.837
Bad dog.

33:35.169 --> 33:36.370
God damn it, Bo.

33:45.070 --> 33:46.469
Oh, shit.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.337
Dr. Ezay's office, Dr. Ezay.

37:15.303 --> 37:16.736
Yeah, is everything okay?

37:21.336 --> 37:23.071
Well how soon can
you make it here?

37:25.903 --> 37:27.067
Yeah, yeah okay, that's fine,

37:27.069 --> 37:28.467
but I need you to hurry.

37:28.469 --> 37:30.670
I have another appointment
in about an hour.

37:32.036 --> 37:33.303
All right, see ya.

37:56.470 --> 37:58.801
- Kaci.
- Jesus Christ.

37:58.803 --> 38:00.835
You look like hell.

38:00.837 --> 38:03.103
Yeah, I was up all
night last night vomiting.

38:04.037 --> 38:06.000
Did you go get checked out?

38:06.002 --> 38:07.801
No, I don't really feel sick.

38:07.803 --> 38:10.767
I just feel really anxious
and kind of stressed.

38:10.769 --> 38:13.867
Well, tell me about this
dream you had last night.

38:13.869 --> 38:15.068
The more and
more I think of it,

38:15.070 --> 38:18.736
I don't know if it was a dream
or if it was in real life.

38:19.869 --> 38:20.803
So what happened?

38:24.837 --> 38:27.168
All right, so I was looking
at myself in the mirror

38:27.170 --> 38:31.467
and I seen this like crazy
distorted version of myself.

38:31.469 --> 38:35.768
As crazy, as crazy as it
seems, I started to feel like

38:35.770 --> 38:38.168
these sharp pains all
throughout my body

38:38.170 --> 38:42.737
and I turned into the creature.

38:43.803 --> 38:45.703
And then what happened?

38:46.802 --> 38:50.067
And then I just
started vomiting blood.

38:50.069 --> 38:53.768
Wait, were you vomiting
blood within your dream

38:53.770 --> 38:55.867
or you were vomiting
blood in reality?

38:55.869 --> 38:56.937
After I woke up.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.336
Are you taking your meds?

39:01.436 --> 39:02.768
Kaci?

39:02.770 --> 39:05.068
I didn't take one yesterday.

39:05.070 --> 39:08.401
Well, you really
need to take your meds,

39:08.403 --> 39:10.267
and we're probably gonna
have to up your dosage.

39:10.269 --> 39:13.167
I really don't think that
the medicine is the problem.

39:13.169 --> 39:15.333
What if what I'm dreaming
about happens in real life?

39:15.335 --> 39:17.468
Well, it can't and it won't.

39:17.470 --> 39:21.034
What I suggest is you
go home, take your meds,

39:21.036 --> 39:24.967
grab a big lunch, and just
relax for the rest of the day.

39:24.969 --> 39:27.037
That's really what you
need to do right now.

39:28.769 --> 39:29.803
Whatever.

39:30.470 --> 39:31.800
Kaci.

39:31.802 --> 39:32.968
What?

39:32.970 --> 39:34.868
I don't need to
remind you what happens

39:34.870 --> 39:36.971
if you go off your meds, right?

39:40.837 --> 39:41.870
Kaci?

39:47.203 --> 39:48.934
That little shit.

39:48.936 --> 39:50.501
Um, he left in a hurry.

39:50.503 --> 39:51.467
Is everything okay?

39:51.469 --> 39:55.800
Great, everything's
great, just perfect.

39:55.802 --> 39:57.800
Can you do me a favor?

39:57.802 --> 39:58.967
Of course.

39:58.969 --> 40:01.234
If Kaci Evans ever comes
here for another appointment

40:01.236 --> 40:04.300
or calls here, you recommend
him to somebody else,

40:04.302 --> 40:05.868
'cause I'm not workin'
with him anymore.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.433
Seriously?

40:07.435 --> 40:09.003
Yes, do it, now.

40:10.836 --> 40:11.670
Okay.

40:20.136 --> 40:22.102
Devin, can you
please answer, man?

40:22.104 --> 40:25.301
Please, I need somebody right,
I need somebody right now.

40:26.936 --> 40:29.736
I went off on my therapist
man, I just, I fuckin' snapped.

40:31.069 --> 40:33.267
I threatened to blackmail him.

40:33.269 --> 40:35.034
I just need you right now.

40:35.036 --> 40:36.735
I need somebody, please.

40:36.737 --> 40:38.737
I tried to call you
like three times, dude.

40:40.802 --> 40:41.437
Call me back.

40:49.335 --> 40:51.670
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

40:59.502 --> 41:00.800
Hello?

41:00.802 --> 41:01.836
Where are you?

41:04.336 --> 41:06.067
I'm at the river
front, what's up?

41:06.069 --> 41:07.201
Oh,
I just got off work.

41:07.203 --> 41:08.303
Do you wanna hang out?

41:10.303 --> 41:12.034
Yeah, I'll be there in a few.

41:12.036 --> 41:13.970
Awesome, see you then.

41:37.102 --> 41:38.333
It was like I blacked out.

41:38.335 --> 41:39.868
Like I remember
everything I said,

41:39.870 --> 41:42.034
but I didn't know
how to control it,

41:42.036 --> 41:43.868
if that makes any sense.

41:43.870 --> 41:44.970
Yeah, I get it.

41:46.068 --> 41:47.800
If you don't mind my asking,

41:47.802 --> 41:50.001
what happens if you don't
take your medication?

41:50.003 --> 41:51.334
Nothing too bad.

41:51.336 --> 41:53.066
I mean, the nightmares get worse

41:53.068 --> 41:55.801
but I feel like it's my
job to kinda control that.

41:55.803 --> 41:56.867
Last time I stopped
taking my medicine

41:56.869 --> 42:00.200
I kinda had this breakdown,
it was just a mess.

42:00.202 --> 42:01.803
So, what happens now?

42:03.069 --> 42:03.735
Well, I'm pretty
sure I'm not allowed

42:03.737 --> 42:05.501
to see that doctor anymore.

42:05.503 --> 42:08.270
Probably not and
it's for the best.

42:09.470 --> 42:12.034
You know, if you ever
need to talk, I'm here

42:12.036 --> 42:15.968
and I'll give you the best
advice I can for free.

42:15.970 --> 42:17.901
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:17.903 --> 42:20.000
Here, want some.

42:20.002 --> 42:21.069
- Yeah, sure.
- Come on.

42:22.269 --> 42:24.100
All right.

42:24.102 --> 42:26.201
I bet I'm a better
thrower than you.

42:26.203 --> 42:27.934
Ready, ready?

42:27.936 --> 42:29.767
I am clearly a better
thrower than you.

42:29.769 --> 42:31.300
- Right, that was horrible.
- Oh, come on.

42:31.302 --> 42:33.066
I'm pretty sure
that's a dead fish.

42:33.068 --> 42:34.102
Oh!

42:41.168 --> 42:42.935
So it kinda gets to the
point where you're like

42:42.937 --> 42:46.000
well who are we kidding, is
this even a friendship anymore?

42:46.002 --> 42:48.768
Long story short, I just,
I wasn't good enough.

42:48.770 --> 42:49.834
Right.

42:49.836 --> 42:51.100
- Yeah.
- No, I understand.

42:51.102 --> 42:53.033
Devin makes me feel
that way all the time.

42:53.035 --> 42:54.067
Seriously?

42:54.069 --> 42:55.935
He seemed pretty
cool last night.

42:55.937 --> 42:57.266
I guess.

42:57.268 --> 42:59.134
Actually, have you
heard from him today?

42:59.136 --> 43:00.068
No, why?

43:00.070 --> 43:01.835
I've just been trying
to get ahold of him

43:01.837 --> 43:03.067
and he hasn't been
answering my phone calls.

43:03.069 --> 43:05.300
Hm, well, you know
where he lives, right?

43:05.302 --> 43:06.999
Yeah.

43:07.001 --> 43:08.234
Well why don't we just
pop by for a little visit?

43:08.236 --> 43:09.066
You driving?

43:09.068 --> 43:10.400
Oh, clearly.

43:10.402 --> 43:12.136
Come on, let's go.

43:18.269 --> 43:20.767
Oh, must be nice to have a
place like this all to yourself.

43:20.769 --> 43:21.404
Right?

43:22.870 --> 43:24.801
His car's here so
he has to be home.

43:24.803 --> 43:25.437
Cool.

43:27.769 --> 43:29.670
Devin, open up.

43:33.368 --> 43:34.935
Hm, let's try this.

43:37.102 --> 43:38.334
You really
have a problem

43:38.336 --> 43:40.100
with locked doors, don't you?

43:40.102 --> 43:41.735
- Guilty.
- I can tell.

43:43.869 --> 43:44.703
Shit.

43:47.068 --> 43:48.102
Yeah?

43:50.002 --> 43:51.002
You're joking.

43:52.302 --> 43:55.301
No, no, I'll be there
in sec, partner.

43:55.303 --> 43:56.735
All right.

43:56.737 --> 43:59.302
- We gotta go.
- Kaci, Kaci, what's going on?

44:16.202 --> 44:17.837
Yeah, that's, that's Devin.

44:18.836 --> 44:19.670
Okay.

44:20.435 --> 44:22.167
Sorry for your loss, bud.

44:22.169 --> 44:25.233
I just need you to sign a few
things before you head out.

44:25.235 --> 44:26.969
Are you a family member of his?

44:28.368 --> 44:30.266
He doesn't have
any close relatives.

44:30.268 --> 44:32.200
He always put me down
on emergency contacts,

44:32.202 --> 44:33.969
that's why I'm here.

44:45.035 --> 44:46.069
Hey, buddy.

44:47.068 --> 44:49.169
Fancy seeing you here, huh?

44:50.868 --> 44:52.467
Can you cover him up?

44:52.469 --> 44:54.902
Sure, sorry about that.

45:19.203 --> 45:20.270
Was it him?

45:22.869 --> 45:23.704
Yeah.

45:25.135 --> 45:26.670
What happened?

45:29.069 --> 45:32.170
They said his neighbors
dog mauled and attacked him.

45:33.803 --> 45:35.237
Jesus Christ.

45:38.202 --> 45:40.366
You'd think that I'm crazy,

45:40.368 --> 45:44.500
but I don't think
that dog did that.

45:44.502 --> 45:47.033
I think it was
something big, I...

45:47.035 --> 45:48.036
Like what?

45:50.001 --> 45:53.433
What if the thing that
attacked my mom, attacked him?

45:53.435 --> 45:56.833
Kaci, Kaci, that's
impossible you...

45:56.835 --> 45:57.968
How?

45:57.970 --> 46:01.200
That was a really long
time ago and the police said

46:01.202 --> 46:04.236
that they found the
dog eating on him.

46:06.968 --> 46:08.202
I just don't believe it.

46:09.368 --> 46:12.036
Come on, we'll get you
home, we'll get you some rest.

46:14.403 --> 46:16.236
I don't think I can.

46:19.068 --> 46:20.136
Yes, you can.

46:21.835 --> 46:22.670
Come on.

46:35.302 --> 46:36.134
Hey.

46:36.136 --> 46:37.133
Yeah?

46:37.135 --> 46:38.734
I'm heading out.

46:38.736 --> 46:40.403
Are you gonna come
back to my place?

46:41.369 --> 46:43.234
Probably not tonight.

46:43.236 --> 46:45.334
I've got a lot of things
going on at the house,

46:45.336 --> 46:48.133
so I'm probably just
gonna head home.

46:48.135 --> 46:51.467
Okay, well, if you
change your mind,

46:51.469 --> 46:52.835
the offer still stands.

46:53.868 --> 46:55.101
All right.

46:55.103 --> 46:57.434
Well if something
changes I'll text you,

46:57.436 --> 47:00.203
call you here in a little bit.

47:08.235 --> 47:09.767
What the?

47:09.769 --> 47:10.403
What now?

49:28.368 --> 49:29.501
Kaci?

49:29.503 --> 49:32.137
Yeah, hold on a sec.

49:39.502 --> 49:41.800
And people say
chivalry's dead.

49:41.802 --> 49:43.769
Yeah I just thought
it would be nice.

49:45.335 --> 49:47.233
Well, after a night
like that I'm used

49:47.235 --> 49:49.467
to waking up and
finding the guy MIA.

49:49.469 --> 49:51.166
No, it's fine.

49:51.168 --> 49:53.735
I can't usually pull off a hit
and run in my own place, so.

49:56.268 --> 49:58.669
You're really somethin'
special, you know?

49:59.936 --> 50:01.234
Special, huh?

50:01.236 --> 50:02.933
Don't act like you don't know.

50:02.935 --> 50:05.101
You know, I'm really
glad this happened.

50:05.103 --> 50:06.370
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:07.503 --> 50:09.367
You don't regret it do you?

50:09.369 --> 50:11.401
No, no, no, I'm
just not usually good

50:11.403 --> 50:12.999
with these type of things.

50:13.001 --> 50:14.403
- Coulda fooled me.
- Yeah?

50:15.768 --> 50:18.266
So, what do you have planned
for the rest of the day?

50:18.268 --> 50:23.269
Um, I think I oughta take a
shower, and that's about it.

50:24.470 --> 50:26.167
Okay, well how
bout you do that,

50:26.169 --> 50:28.000
and then we can get
the fuck outta here

50:28.002 --> 50:29.367
and get our minds
off everything.

50:29.369 --> 50:30.333
Sounds like a plan.

50:30.335 --> 50:31.369
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:36.836 --> 50:38.669
- You first.
- All right.

51:10.836 --> 51:12.300
I'm gonna go grab my bike.

51:12.302 --> 51:14.201
Oh, no, no, don't worry
about it, I'll drive.

51:14.203 --> 51:15.334
Are you sure?

51:15.336 --> 51:16.334
I really don't want you
goin' outta your way again.

51:16.336 --> 51:18.369
Am I not invited to
stay the night again?

51:19.501 --> 51:21.136
Didn't think
that was the plan.

51:22.436 --> 51:23.270
Come on.

51:28.002 --> 51:29.166
So where are we doing?

51:29.168 --> 51:31.133
We are going to investigate.

51:31.135 --> 51:31.967
Investigate what?

51:31.969 --> 51:33.401
This whole wolf thing.

51:33.403 --> 51:35.100
Wait I thought you
weren't buying into that?

51:35.102 --> 51:37.067
I wasn't, but clearly
there's something going on,

51:37.069 --> 51:38.267
people are going missing.

51:38.269 --> 51:39.499
The police say it's
some sort of dog

51:39.501 --> 51:42.467
and they're doing absolutely
nothing about it, so why not?

51:42.469 --> 51:43.400
Why not?

51:43.402 --> 51:44.867
For one it's dangerous and two,

51:44.869 --> 51:46.301
we don't even know
where to start.

51:46.303 --> 51:48.899
Okay, cemeteries, abandoned
buildings, the woods.

51:48.901 --> 51:50.433
Okay, well you're
not gonna find

51:50.435 --> 51:53.467
the thing roaming around the
woods and I think we only have

51:53.469 --> 51:55.301
like one abandoned
building here in town.

51:55.303 --> 51:56.766
Okay, well let's start there.

51:56.768 --> 51:59.101
Seriously, why
are you doing this?

51:59.103 --> 52:00.500
You said everybody in
this town just remembers

52:00.502 --> 52:02.401
you as the boy who
cried wolf, right?

52:02.403 --> 52:03.866
What if we could change that?

52:03.868 --> 52:05.367
And what if we can't?

52:05.369 --> 52:06.499
I'm just known as crazy again.

52:06.501 --> 52:08.167
Okay, well we just
won't say anything

52:08.169 --> 52:09.202
unless we find proof.

52:11.869 --> 52:13.769
You'll be fine, I promise.

52:16.001 --> 52:16.833
Let's go.

52:16.835 --> 52:17.899
Okay?

52:17.901 --> 52:18.735
Okay.

52:50.069 --> 52:51.900
Any preference
on a flashlight?

52:51.902 --> 52:53.499
I mean, they're all
basically the same, right?

52:53.501 --> 52:54.402
Yeah, I guess.

52:55.936 --> 52:58.400
Oh, should we invest
in some weapons?

52:58.402 --> 53:01.200
I thought we were lookin' to
find the thing, not kill it.

53:01.202 --> 53:03.170
Right, no weapons.

53:04.303 --> 53:05.100
Okay, I
think we're good.

53:05.102 --> 53:05.902
Okay.

53:08.136 --> 53:08.970
Hello.

53:10.203 --> 53:11.432
I assume you're
paying for this?

53:11.434 --> 53:12.669
Yes.

53:14.868 --> 53:15.867
$8.95.

53:15.869 --> 53:16.936
Thank you, sir.

53:24.002 --> 53:26.170
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

53:37.501 --> 53:39.101
You got the stuff?

53:39.103 --> 53:40.803
- Yes.
- Thank you.

53:42.136 --> 53:43.267
So this is the place, huh?

53:43.269 --> 53:44.466
Yup.

53:44.468 --> 53:46.499
Hope you're not
afraid of the dark.

53:46.501 --> 53:47.800
I guess we'll find out.

53:47.802 --> 53:48.836
Come on.

53:53.769 --> 53:54.866
You got it?

53:54.868 --> 53:55.702
Almost.

53:58.802 --> 54:00.834
Huh, taught you well.

54:00.836 --> 54:02.800
Yeah, you first.

54:02.802 --> 54:03.969
Fair enough.

54:06.801 --> 54:08.368
- Holy shit.
- Right?

54:11.802 --> 54:13.499
All right, I gotta
confess something.

54:13.501 --> 54:14.933
What's that?

54:14.935 --> 54:16.769
I'm a little
afraid of the dark.

54:18.236 --> 54:19.966
Think it might be a little
late for you bringing that up.

54:19.968 --> 54:22.702
I'll be fine, I think.

54:23.868 --> 54:26.034
Okay, so if you
were a big bad wolf,

54:26.036 --> 54:27.867
where would you be hiding?

54:27.869 --> 54:29.033
Oh definitely
here to start with.

54:29.035 --> 54:31.234
Yeah, this place is pretty
fuckin' creepy, isn't it?

54:31.236 --> 54:32.333
Right?

54:32.335 --> 54:33.466
What'd it used to be?

54:33.468 --> 54:35.332
Uh, it was a lot of things
over the last few years,

54:35.334 --> 54:37.933
but I think most recently
is a mechanic shop.

54:37.935 --> 54:40.265
Ah, well it smells horrid.

54:40.267 --> 54:43.500
Yeah, something's definitely
fucking died in here.

54:43.502 --> 54:45.800
Okay, so we got a lot
of ground to cover,

54:45.802 --> 54:48.734
why don't we just split up
and see what we can find?

54:48.736 --> 54:50.703
Sounds like a plan.

54:51.501 --> 54:54.133
If anything happens
just yell for me.

54:54.135 --> 54:55.036
I'll come running.

54:56.002 --> 54:59.870
- All right.
- Okay, I'm gonna go this way.

55:26.768 --> 55:28.770
What the fuck is this?

56:07.802 --> 56:08.900
Ema!

56:08.902 --> 56:09.936
Kaci!

56:36.036 --> 56:37.436
Kaci, Kaci, Kaci!

56:59.869 --> 57:00.770
Help, help!

57:04.001 --> 57:05.867
Ah, help!

57:49.134 --> 57:49.970
Ma'am?

57:51.036 --> 57:52.702
Ma'am where are you?

57:57.802 --> 57:58.436
Freeze!

58:10.002 --> 58:11.199
Fuck me.

58:11.201 --> 58:13.333
Don't go near him.

58:13.335 --> 58:14.999
It's
okay, I shot him.

58:15.001 --> 58:17.000
Are you all right?

58:17.002 --> 58:18.202
Yeah.

58:19.802 --> 58:21.769
Do you mind telling me
what the fuck this thing is?

58:28.902 --> 58:29.933
Help me.

58:29.935 --> 58:31.333
Please, don't.

58:36.068 --> 58:37.867
Help me, please!

58:37.869 --> 58:39.236
Ah, please help me!

58:51.001 --> 58:53.166
Wake up, wake up!

58:53.168 --> 58:54.003
Help.

58:55.101 --> 58:56.866
Please, help.

58:56.868 --> 58:57.702
Please.

58:59.901 --> 59:01.100
Please.

59:01.102 --> 59:02.102
Help.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.036
I'm.

59:11.268 --> 59:14.036
Kaci, Kaci, no, no, no, Kaci.

59:14.935 --> 59:17.967
God dammit, no
Kaci, Kaci, please.

59:17.969 --> 59:19.332
Kaci, please, please.

59:19.334 --> 59:20.933
Please Kaci, please.

59:20.935 --> 59:25.068
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

59:50.001 --> 59:51.966
You're Miss Gray, correct?

59:51.968 --> 59:53.001
Yes.

59:54.102 --> 59:57.332
I'm Dr. Mennik, I'm Kaci's
previous psychiatrist.

59:57.334 --> 01:00:00.032
You're probably wondering
what's going on.

01:00:00.034 --> 01:00:01.102
I don't understand.

01:00:02.469 --> 01:00:05.933
Kaci suffers from multiple
mental health issues.

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.132
He has paranoid schizophrenia

01:00:07.134 --> 01:00:09.467
and multiple
personality disorder.

01:00:09.469 --> 01:00:12.100
He also suffered
trauma as a child.

01:00:12.102 --> 01:00:14.866
He saw his mother being
mauled to death by a wolf.

01:00:14.868 --> 01:00:17.099
And he still has
nightmares about that,

01:00:17.101 --> 01:00:19.734
and he blacks out.

01:00:19.736 --> 01:00:20.966
Sometimes for hours at a time

01:00:20.968 --> 01:00:23.332
and he has no idea
what he's been doing.

01:00:23.334 --> 01:00:25.199
Are you even allowed
to be telling me this?

01:00:25.201 --> 01:00:27.165
Kaci wanted me to
talk to you about this.

01:00:27.167 --> 01:00:29.266
He wanted to make
sure you're okay.

01:00:29.268 --> 01:00:31.733
I'm fine, I just
don't understand.

01:00:31.735 --> 01:00:35.099
He just blacks out
and puts on a costume?

01:00:35.101 --> 01:00:37.399
That appears to be
what's been going on,

01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:39.834
but I don't know for how long.

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:44.036
And he probably doesn't
know what he's been doing.

01:00:45.067 --> 01:00:46.101
So, he's crazy?

01:00:47.034 --> 01:00:48.301
Crazy is a harsh word.

01:00:49.735 --> 01:00:51.899
Now let's just say
he's wired wrong.

01:00:51.901 --> 01:00:54.033
Something like that,
you're born with it.

01:00:54.035 --> 01:00:55.998
Now, I assume you know Kaci

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.001
to be a sweet, funny
gentleman, correct?

01:01:01.135 --> 01:01:02.333
He's the best person I know.

01:01:02.335 --> 01:01:03.866
Well, that's the real Kaci.

01:01:03.868 --> 01:01:05.032
The man in the suit, isn't.

01:01:05.034 --> 01:01:06.135
You have to remember that.

01:01:07.768 --> 01:01:10.200
So is he gonna spend the
rest of his life locked away?

01:01:10.202 --> 01:01:12.065
He has a good lawyer.

01:01:12.067 --> 01:01:14.366
I assume he'll get
off pleading insanity,

01:01:14.368 --> 01:01:16.369
but I don't know
what's going to happen.

01:01:17.401 --> 01:01:19.734
I'm sorry, this is just a lot.

01:01:19.736 --> 01:01:22.032
I can't really come...

01:01:22.034 --> 01:01:23.433
I understand.

01:01:23.435 --> 01:01:26.102
But if you have anymore
questions, give me a call.

01:01:48.934 --> 01:01:50.102
I ruined it.

01:01:52.268 --> 01:01:54.136
I ruined everything.

01:02:05.067 --> 01:02:07.136
Kaci, can you
bring me a trash bag?

01:02:09.068 --> 01:02:10.102
Kaci?

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:18.702
Kaci?

01:02:20.068 --> 01:02:21.670
Kaci, what's wrong?

01:02:22.334 --> 01:02:24.734
Are you okay, honey?

01:02:24.736 --> 01:02:25.369
Yeah.

01:02:26.736 --> 01:02:29.302
Oh good, now go
get me a trash bag.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.368
Have a nice appointment, man.

01:03:36.302 --> 01:03:39.467
- Sister, sister.
- Hey, this is a surprise.

01:03:39.469 --> 01:03:40.898
What are you doin' here?

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.332
What, I can't come
by and fix you dinner?

01:03:42.334 --> 01:03:44.466
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

01:03:44.468 --> 01:03:45.467
Get up.

01:03:45.469 --> 01:03:47.200
Time to rest and relax.

01:03:47.202 --> 01:03:48.433
Say no more.

01:03:48.435 --> 01:03:50.801
I'll go inside and get
cleaned up a little bit.

01:03:52.235 --> 01:03:53.399
So how's the babes?

01:03:53.401 --> 01:03:55.965
I know he was
feelin' kinda green.

01:03:55.967 --> 01:03:57.199
He's doing a lot better.

01:03:57.201 --> 01:03:59.168
Ah it's just God, he's
growing up so fast.

01:04:00.334 --> 01:04:01.168
How are you?

01:04:02.102 --> 01:04:03.765
I'm all right.

01:04:03.767 --> 01:04:05.266
Any new guys?

01:04:05.268 --> 01:04:07.099
No, no, no, not at all.

01:04:07.101 --> 01:04:09.235
It's just been really hard.

01:04:10.235 --> 01:04:11.369
I still miss Kaci.

01:04:12.767 --> 01:04:14.166
I know you do.

01:04:14.168 --> 01:04:15.366
You're gonna have a son that's

01:04:15.368 --> 01:04:17.169
gonna grow up to
look just like him.

01:04:19.402 --> 01:04:22.299
I think Kaci woulda
been a really good father.

01:04:22.301 --> 01:04:24.934
Yeah, I know it was
really rough for you,

01:04:25.935 --> 01:04:27.035
and that you miss him.

01:04:28.134 --> 01:04:31.165
And this is gonna sound
harsh, kinda mean,

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:33.366
but it's time for
you to move on.

01:04:33.368 --> 01:04:34.233
No, you're right.

01:04:34.235 --> 01:04:37.733
I agree, it's just...

01:04:37.735 --> 01:04:39.300
So?

01:04:39.302 --> 01:04:43.133
With that said, are
you free Saturday?

01:04:43.135 --> 01:04:44.765
Yes, why?

01:04:44.767 --> 01:04:46.798
Okay, just listen to me.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.365
I work for this guy and I
wanna hook you up with him.

01:04:50.367 --> 01:04:51.865
No god, Kelly, why?

01:04:51.867 --> 01:04:53.065
Just be open minded.

01:04:53.067 --> 01:04:58.202
Listen to me, he is cute, he
is nice, he has some money.

01:05:00.301 --> 01:05:02.033
- No, no.
- Yes, yes!

01:05:02.035 --> 01:05:02.833
Kelly, I can't.

01:05:02.835 --> 01:05:03.499
Just do it!

01:05:03.501 --> 01:05:05.365
- No!
- Just do it.

01:05:05.367 --> 01:05:06.765
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

01:05:06.767 --> 01:05:07.432
- No.
- Yes.

01:05:07.434 --> 01:05:10.199
- No.
- Yes!

01:05:10.201 --> 01:05:11.798
Well, thank you
for dinner again.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.102
Not a problem.

01:05:13.967 --> 01:05:15.068
Give me hugs.

01:05:17.301 --> 01:05:18.267
Bye.

01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:22.332
So, Saturday, I'm gonna
come by, come babysit.

01:05:22.334 --> 01:05:23.966
You're gonna have to give me
some time to think about it.

01:05:23.968 --> 01:05:26.899
No, I'll see you Saturday
and I'm gonna babysit.

01:05:26.901 --> 01:05:28.366
- Okay.
- Okay, love you.

01:05:28.368 --> 01:05:29.833
- Love you.
- Okay thanks bye.

01:05:29.835 --> 01:05:31.336
- Love you more.
- Bye, Kelly.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.101
Aunt Kelly's crazy,
isn't she honey?

01:06:05.367 --> 01:06:06.201
Hey buddy.

01:06:08.767 --> 01:06:10.934
Sorry I can't be here
for you and your mom.

01:06:13.234 --> 01:06:16.402
She's gonna be a
good mom, though.

01:06:19.168 --> 01:06:21.236
You gotta make me a
promise though, okay?

01:06:23.267 --> 01:06:24.901
Don't grow up to be like me.

01:06:26.335 --> 01:06:29.268
Please, whatever you do, do
not grow up to be like me.

01:06:33.767 --> 01:06:35.801
I'm so sorry I can't
be here for you.

01:06:39.235 --> 01:06:40.136
I love you.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:18.798
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:11:22.034 --> 01:11:23.165
I'm sayin' let's
do it like that.

01:11:23.167 --> 01:11:24.899
Are you rolling?

01:11:24.901 --> 01:11:26.069
I mean hung.

01:11:31.333 --> 01:11:32.399
So with saying that,

01:11:32.401 --> 01:11:35.032
how much would you charge
me for a photo shoot?

01:11:35.034 --> 01:11:36.099
I'm supposed to say that?

01:11:40.266 --> 01:11:41.669
Rolling, nope.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.898
No?

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.036
It was wrong.

01:11:50.968 --> 01:11:52.232
That's hilarious.

01:11:52.234 --> 01:11:53.365
Last time he
did a Cooper scream.

01:11:53.367 --> 01:11:55.733
Okay, what else?

01:11:55.735 --> 01:11:56.866
You forget
a lot, don't you?

01:11:56.868 --> 01:11:58.298
- What's wrong?
- I do.

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.136
Then you say hey
baby, what's....

01:12:03.401 --> 01:12:04.498
Okay.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.166
I'm thinking
about making your favorite.

01:12:06.168 --> 01:12:07.398
Pizza rolls?

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.899
Yup.

01:12:08.901 --> 01:12:10.199
No.

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:11.002
Oh.

01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:15.965
Way too hard.

01:12:15.967 --> 01:12:19.999
Way too hard.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.465
Dammit.

01:12:23.467 --> 01:12:24.132
You
looked like a bull.

01:12:25.201 --> 01:12:26.865
Can't you see those

01:12:26.867 --> 01:12:27.698
Nice young men
and their clean white coats

01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.734
and they're coming
to take me away.

01:12:30.867 --> 01:12:32.264
Okay.

01:12:32.266 --> 01:12:33.465
Fuck off.

01:12:33.467 --> 01:12:35.100
You doin' that shit?

01:12:35.102 --> 01:12:36.765
Yes, you did.

01:12:36.767 --> 01:12:38.898
Now come back here
you little shit.

01:12:42.068 --> 01:12:43.499
I peed.

01:12:43.501 --> 01:12:45.832
I'll be dammed, hey buddy...
