01:09.341 --> 01:11.453
Every family has its morning rituals.

01:11.514 --> 01:12.452
I know mine did.

01:12.564 --> 01:14.740
The gun went off at
7:00, rise and shine.

01:15.487 --> 01:18.543
Actually, we were never
that big on the shine, but...

01:18.963 --> 01:22.737
what I really remember
about morning was... coffee--

01:23.198 --> 01:26.060
the smell of it, the sounds of it...

01:27.089 --> 01:29.383
everyone in my family loved coffee.

01:32.614 --> 01:36.577
This sounds weird, but sometimes I
think it's the one thing we all loved.

01:36.860 --> 01:37.833
Can I see the obits?

01:40.786 --> 01:42.537
- More coffee?
- Please.

01:43.879 --> 01:44.836
It's my guy.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.222
That's the guy I kissed.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.439
He's old. And dead.

01:50.494 --> 01:52.644
The guy I kissed isn't
dead. That's his dad.

01:52.751 --> 01:56.776
I reaped his dad. And his
memorial service is today at 3:00.

01:56.818 --> 01:58.425
Wear something black and short.

01:58.558 --> 02:00.764
- Really? You think I should go?
- Absolutely.

02:01.410 --> 02:04.215
Point grey club. Mm.
Elegant. Maybe something...

02:04.799 --> 02:05.961
black and long.

02:05.997 --> 02:07.538
What's that expression?

02:08.031 --> 02:12.038
"Don't shit where you eat.
Don't shit where you reap?"

02:12.094 --> 02:13.128
I'm definitely not going.

02:13.202 --> 02:14.375
I'm going to help you pick out aoutfit.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.409
Yeah. Please.

02:15.894 --> 02:16.652
Bonjour.

02:17.439 --> 02:18.562
What's in the bag?

02:18.632 --> 02:19.915
Cinnamon buns.

02:20.004 --> 02:20.968
- Mm!
- Feel free.

02:22.690 --> 02:23.733
They're still warm.

02:23.861 --> 02:27.255
Mm! I do love me a tasty cinnamon bun.

02:27.308 --> 02:30.390
Mm. I'm so glad I'm
done for today, I swear.

02:30.871 --> 02:32.396
- You had to reap this morning?
- Yeah.

02:32.577 --> 02:35.582
That frosting applicator, a
dangerous bloody machine, that is.

02:35.642 --> 02:38.367
It took the guy's hand clean off.

02:38.858 --> 02:43.180
Well, the hand straight
off. He died of blood loss.

02:43.912 --> 02:44.705
Or shock.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.708
Something. Can't remember.

02:46.749 --> 02:49.447
Anyway, really, really, really,
really, really bloody death.

02:49.492 --> 02:51.929
- It's disgusting.
- What?

02:52.851 --> 02:54.864
Oh, don't be such sissies.

02:54.929 --> 02:55.999
These ones are clean.

02:56.152 --> 02:58.149
I wiped the blood off of them ones.

02:58.637 --> 02:59.573
You're disgusting.

02:59.650 --> 03:01.135
Anything interesting in the obits?

03:01.652 --> 03:03.327
Nope, just the
usual crap--

03:03.382 --> 03:06.783
cherished schoolmaster, beloved
aunt, dead construction worker.

03:07.106 --> 03:08.500
For you, my dear.

03:09.375 --> 03:10.807
And you, my friend.

03:11.272 --> 03:12.199
4:00?

03:13.633 --> 03:15.457
- That a problem?
- No. It's just...

03:16.200 --> 03:17.228
it's just...

03:17.283 --> 03:18.298
a girl has a life.

03:18.553 --> 03:21.155
- For example?
- Oh. Stuff.

03:21.215 --> 03:21.892
Well...

03:22.260 --> 03:24.652
since this is not a facial,
but the end of a person's life,

03:24.698 --> 03:26.567
I don't think it can be rescheduled.

03:26.724 --> 03:28.354
You're a smart girl, George.

03:29.270 --> 03:30.606
Juggle things.

03:30.937 --> 03:32.065
I can juggle things.

03:32.143 --> 03:33.488
I can juggle things.

03:34.196 --> 03:34.871
One...

03:35.299 --> 03:36.474
deux...

03:37.642 --> 03:38.625
uh, three.

03:39.209 --> 03:40.284
Ahem. Ready?

03:44.288 --> 03:45.332
Whoo-oo-hoo.

03:49.161 --> 03:50.087
You're an idiot.

03:50.207 --> 03:51.061
Actually, these

03:52.151 --> 03:54.636
cinnamon buns started off to
be a very nice gesture, Rube,

03:54.677 --> 03:59.590
and what I wanted to do is get people
breakfast, and that's what I get.

03:59.643 --> 04:00.636
Daisy, back me up.

04:00.984 --> 04:02.531
Your heart's in the right place.

04:02.598 --> 04:04.665
Your heart's not in the right place.

04:05.100 --> 04:09.016
The heart is not, as is so
often seen on television,

04:09.083 --> 04:10.881
in the center of the body.

04:10.982 --> 04:12.617
But thank you, Audrey.

04:16.862 --> 04:19.482
Okay, who would like to go next?

04:20.629 --> 04:22.749
Who would like to show
their model of the heart?

04:23.387 --> 04:24.259
Francis?

04:24.530 --> 04:26.820
Excellent. You're going
to like this, Reggie.

04:27.740 --> 04:28.688
Okay.

04:34.321 --> 04:36.436
Before I begin, I would
just want to say thank you

04:36.498 --> 04:38.406
for the tribute to
my dead komodo dragon,

04:38.472 --> 04:40.992
who was tragically killed
last week during school.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.927
I'm sure Frodo's in heaven, Francis.

04:43.004 --> 04:47.279
Although there's no scientific evidence
to support that, mrs. Ricket, thanks.

04:47.597 --> 04:48.503
You're welcome.

04:48.928 --> 04:50.152
Whenever you're ready, Francis.

04:51.841 --> 04:54.247
"The human heart," by Francis Bischetti.

04:54.863 --> 04:58.815
My first attempt at modelling the
heart using dry macaroni was a disaster.

04:59.113 --> 05:01.149
The right ventricle kept falling off.

05:01.414 --> 05:04.417
So what you are about to see,
I have entitled "the heart--

05:04.595 --> 05:05.491
2.0"

05:06.587 --> 05:07.493
Oh, cool.

05:07.572 --> 05:09.849
Uh, Francis, where--
where did you get that?

05:09.962 --> 05:10.678
The internet.

05:10.934 --> 05:11.984
Is it from an animal?

05:12.084 --> 05:13.869
It just said "heart" on the website.

05:13.971 --> 05:16.889
It was from an international
mail code. Rwanda, I believe.

05:17.001 --> 05:18.435
Uh, Francis, the, uh,

05:18.527 --> 05:21.189
the assignment was to
make a model of the heart,

05:21.236 --> 05:22.670
not, uh, to buy one.

05:33.314 --> 05:35.505
Uh, Reggie? I believe you're next.

05:35.942 --> 05:37.159
I  don't have it.

05:38.642 --> 05:39.596
Okay...

05:42.019 --> 05:44.031
and, uh, why don't you have it?

05:44.518 --> 05:46.585
- Well...
- Her dog ate it! Yeah, um...

05:47.533 --> 05:49.806
Yeah.  That'll teach you to
make a heart out of liver.

05:49.862 --> 05:51.551
Everybody knows dogs like liver.

05:52.164 --> 05:53.636
Is that what happened, Reggie?

05:57.072 --> 05:58.669
Yeah. My dog ate it.

05:59.942 --> 06:00.768
Okay.

06:01.645 --> 06:03.724
Reggie, I'll give you until tomorrow.

06:05.172 --> 06:06.499
Coffee's nice this morning.

06:07.530 --> 06:08.960
Tastes the same to me.

06:09.380 --> 06:10.721
Did you make it this morning, Crystal?

06:10.978 --> 06:12.453
Do anything different?

06:13.001 --> 06:15.351
Different beans?
Bottled water? Cold drip?

06:15.412 --> 06:17.014
Hmm. Tastes different.

06:17.061 --> 06:18.375
Maybe you're the one that's different.

06:18.813 --> 06:21.376
You know what, Misty? I think
you're the one that's different.

06:23.021 --> 06:25.585
Oh, did I tell you Fred asked
me out last week for coffee.

06:25.955 --> 06:26.579
And?

06:26.635 --> 06:28.120
Well, I don't want
to have sex with Fred.

06:28.181 --> 06:29.791
It's just coffee.

06:29.861 --> 06:31.443
Coffee's code, Millie.

06:32.348 --> 06:33.685
Fred wants me.

06:33.849 --> 06:36.336
He wants a double-shot of Misty...

06:37.299 --> 06:39.261
extra foam.

06:41.042 --> 06:41.878
You know...

06:41.970 --> 06:46.172
Misty, sometimes coffee is just coffee.

06:46.230 --> 06:49.014
I work here 35 hours a
week, and I swear to god,

06:49.086 --> 06:52.245
I spend 34 of them thinking about sex.

06:52.303 --> 06:55.000
- And the other hour?
- Oh, I'm having sex.

06:55.994 --> 06:57.837
You're so full of shit, Misty.

06:58.507 --> 06:59.819
Que pasa, Julio?

07:04.038 --> 07:06.176
When was the last time
you had sex, Millie?

07:06.787 --> 07:07.822
Never?

07:07.959 --> 07:10.387
Oh, it's been a while.

07:10.518 --> 07:12.919
What are you ladies talking about?

07:13.162 --> 07:14.098
Coffee.

07:14.446 --> 07:17.401
I could use a nice cup of
coffee myself, right about now.

07:21.933 --> 07:23.740
I can't feel my arm.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.059
Stan? Stan! Say something.

07:26.310 --> 07:28.058
Oh, my lord. He's having a coronary.

07:29.132 --> 07:30.764
Is he gonna die?

07:30.886 --> 07:32.230
Mama, can you hear me?

07:32.682 --> 07:34.912
Don't look at me. I
don't have his post-it.

07:35.029 --> 07:37.972
All right, Happy Time,
life-support plan. Code blue.

07:38.173 --> 07:40.369
People, man your posts. On the double!

07:44.795 --> 07:45.636
Millie!

07:46.206 --> 07:47.666
Uh, I wasn't here that day.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.717
Come on, people!

07:50.487 --> 07:52.473
Where's my defibrillator crew?

08:01.824 --> 08:05.192
There's cheese on these!

08:06.159 --> 08:10.592
Who has been making grilled-cheese
sandwiches with the defibrillator paddles?

08:14.923 --> 08:16.532
Congratulations, Happy Time.

08:17.157 --> 08:18.475
You just killed a man.

08:22.077 --> 08:23.195
Thank you, Stan.

08:29.818 --> 08:32.947
You know, I'm really
disappointed, people.

08:33.182 --> 08:36.123
We had C.P.R. Training last month,

08:36.167 --> 08:39.072
and we're doing it again
tomorrow morning, mandatory.

08:39.246 --> 08:42.788
It's a little unsettling getting
that close to death, isn't it?

08:43.005 --> 08:44.369
Mm. Not so much.

08:46.462 --> 08:48.507
I think George is in love.

08:48.988 --> 08:50.064
She tell you that?

08:50.315 --> 08:51.793
No. She didn't have to.

08:52.684 --> 08:54.973
Unlike you, I can sense these things.

08:55.041 --> 08:55.977
What are you trying to say?

08:56.325 --> 08:57.677
I have keen intuition.

08:57.739 --> 08:59.760
Oh, you wish you had my intuition.

08:59.812 --> 09:01.620
Oh, Roxy, it's not a contest.

09:02.404 --> 09:04.000
I got to hop, got a soul to take.

09:08.635 --> 09:09.869
I know this address.

09:10.463 --> 09:12.618
- That's the Millstone hotel.
- Really?

09:13.347 --> 09:15.679
Well, how fun. I love hotels.

09:16.248 --> 09:18.269
Maybe I'll dress up as a housekeeper.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.067
Why aren't you wearing
your cross anymore?

09:20.374 --> 09:21.327
I lost it.

09:23.017 --> 09:25.714
- Your faith or the cross?
- Both.

09:26.472 --> 09:29.243
I was just playing the part
of the nice catholic girl.

09:30.056 --> 09:31.701
I'm not, I'm not the real thing.

09:31.751 --> 09:32.411
No?

09:33.806 --> 09:35.708
The spiritual thing isn't me.

09:36.449 --> 09:40.045
I'm an actress. I'm just
a really good actress.

09:40.301 --> 09:42.314
Whatever you say, Daisy.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.397
Daisy adair.

09:46.144 --> 09:49.636
So  our little Georgie is crashing
a memorial service to chase a boy?

09:49.686 --> 09:50.879
Yeah. She won't actually go.

09:51.918 --> 09:52.583
No?

09:52.635 --> 09:53.481
She'll chicken out.

09:53.536 --> 09:55.847
I have the Millstone reap, and
she's too afraid to go alone.

09:57.291 --> 09:58.330
This way, please.

10:00.715 --> 10:02.590
No, really not my crowd.

10:02.773 --> 10:04.049
You and me both, pal.

10:05.226 --> 10:07.673
You couldn't fall for a
nice working man, could you?

10:07.710 --> 10:09.721
You had to find a bloody aristocrat.

10:09.942 --> 10:10.638
He works.

10:11.314 --> 10:13.065
He's a journalist.

10:13.229 --> 10:17.233
Hah, works? For his rich dead
father's newspaper-- cha-ching!

10:17.417 --> 10:22.105
Can you just try to behave
yourself and act like a gentleman?

10:22.160 --> 10:24.149
- Fuck off.
- Okay, fine.

10:24.909 --> 10:26.337
How do I look?

10:27.477 --> 10:29.285
Actually, you look really nice.

10:29.844 --> 10:31.097
Very "come hither."

10:31.933 --> 10:32.491
Ooh.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.223
Good.

10:35.311 --> 10:38.137
- So which one is he? - The
good-looking guy in black.

10:38.527 --> 10:40.161
Mm. Yes. Still not clear.

10:41.588 --> 10:42.597
That one.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.325
I really like him, so
don't screw this up.

10:46.388 --> 10:47.092
I won't.

10:48.946 --> 10:50.062
George, why am I here?

10:50.133 --> 10:53.116
To  pay your respects to
his father, Thomas Hesburgh.

10:53.219 --> 10:54.124
Okay, got it.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.646
And why are you here?

10:56.746 --> 10:58.941
To pay my respects to his father.

10:58.992 --> 10:59.990
Thomas hesburgh.

11:01.931 --> 11:05.675
Oh, my god. You reaped his father.
Now you want to snog his son. Hah.

11:07.408 --> 11:09.442
I don't know. I just...

11:09.917 --> 11:14.279
Look, I have one hour
before my reap, so whatever.

11:14.363 --> 11:16.068
Oh, let's synchronize watches.

11:16.139 --> 11:18.373
- Good idea.
- I don't have a watch.

11:19.908 --> 11:21.030
It's almost time to go.

11:21.495 --> 11:23.358
I don't want to go to dad's tonight.

11:24.199 --> 11:26.257
- You have to.
- Why?

11:27.230 --> 11:29.083
Because it's court-ordered.

11:30.050 --> 11:31.474
Do you have any homework for tonight?

11:32.866 --> 11:35.907
I sort of didn't finish
that biology project.

11:35.964 --> 11:37.105
The heart model?

11:38.074 --> 11:39.476
I thought that was due today.

11:39.779 --> 11:43.685
- It was, but...
- But what?

11:44.770 --> 11:48.483
What am I supposed to do with all
the papier-mâché I bought, hmm?

11:48.928 --> 11:50.061
Put it in the basement?

11:50.208 --> 11:53.751
Along with your drum set
and your riding clothes?

11:54.154 --> 11:57.320
- The teenage graveyard.
- It's not a graveyard.

11:57.817 --> 11:59.808
I know. It's just an expression.

12:00.683 --> 12:02.666
Mrs. Ricket said I could have more time.

12:03.491 --> 12:06.838
Hmm. That was very nice of mrs. Ricket.

12:08.564 --> 12:10.110
She had George in her class.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.733
Mrs.  Ricket was very fond of George.

12:13.811 --> 12:15.931
A lot of george's teachers liked her.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.856
So why'd she drop out of college?

12:18.456 --> 12:19.632
To make me mad.

12:20.836 --> 12:23.292
- Really?
- No.

12:25.265 --> 12:26.760
I don't know what happened.

12:28.132 --> 12:30.431
I think she would have gone back...

12:30.722 --> 12:32.367
you know, eventually.

12:34.762 --> 12:35.700
I don't know.

12:36.107 --> 12:39.448
You should bring that
biology project to your dad's.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.712
All right? You can finish it there.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.673
- Why can't I do it here?
- Reggie.

12:42.869 --> 12:44.270
His place is cheesy.

12:44.322 --> 12:45.417
There's carpets in the bathroom,

12:45.490 --> 12:48.085
and you can hear people
making sounds through the wall.

12:48.136 --> 12:50.216
- Your father?
- No, his fat neighbor.

12:50.294 --> 12:53.396
- What kind of sounds?
- Bathroom sounds.

12:53.472 --> 12:54.954
Ugh. That's bad.

12:55.472 --> 12:57.686
And I'll never get it
finished there, anyway,

12:57.768 --> 12:59.530
and you're the one who's
good at building stuff.

13:00.820 --> 13:03.032
He wants to spend time with you.

13:03.442 --> 13:05.525
He even asked if he could get you early.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.109
So why don't you and I
just get started on it,

13:09.160 --> 13:12.211
and if we don't get it finished
by the time dad gets here...

13:13.211 --> 13:14.690
you'll finish it.

13:15.124 --> 13:18.955
Reggie, I cannot do all
your homework for you, okay?

13:19.002 --> 13:20.342
You'll never learn anything.

13:20.402 --> 13:22.359
You want me to get
into college, don't you?

13:26.060 --> 13:28.007
Just go get the stuff.

13:36.343 --> 13:37.208
Housekeeping.

13:39.670 --> 13:41.627
Hey, who stole my fucking cart?

13:46.158 --> 13:47.147
Anyone here?

13:48.046 --> 13:49.102
Housekeeping.

13:49.784 --> 13:53.092
Oh, yes, could I get some fresh
towels in the bath, please?

13:53.265 --> 13:55.641
I just need some fresh towels.

13:55.998 --> 13:56.914
For one or two?

13:57.422 --> 13:59.158
Um, two, please.

13:59.347 --> 14:01.082
He loves fresh towels, so...

14:01.443 --> 14:03.049
thank you, Latanya.

14:03.162 --> 14:05.184
Sure. My pleasure.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.152
Oh, my goodness.

14:08.354 --> 14:10.478
What exquisite things.

14:11.010 --> 14:11.682
You think so?

14:11.922 --> 14:14.615
Yeah. I'd do anything for
lovely things like this.

14:15.982 --> 14:17.441
Well, I actually have...

14:18.906 --> 14:20.499
Which one do you think I should wear?

14:20.934 --> 14:22.643
It's not my area of expertise.

14:23.228 --> 14:25.598
Because I know that he likes red.

14:25.674 --> 14:29.341
Um, I've seen his
wife wear a lot of red.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.090
Then maybe something not red.

14:32.449 --> 14:34.359
Right. Isn't that the point?

14:34.780 --> 14:38.270
Do something different, something
that maybe his wife wouldn't do?

14:38.382 --> 14:39.761
Too true. Go with the pink.

14:40.483 --> 14:43.308
Men love pink. Makes them
feel like the strong one.

14:44.256 --> 14:45.327
That's so smart.

14:45.643 --> 14:46.810
I've got a million of 'em.

14:47.732 --> 14:48.894
Nice hard bed.

14:49.339 --> 14:50.901
Love that.

14:51.341 --> 14:53.497
But, you know, I worry about the pink,

14:53.702 --> 14:56.502
because I think that would
look a bit too desperate?

14:56.554 --> 14:57.891
No, no, no, not desperate.

14:58.285 --> 14:59.084
Delicate.

14:59.744 --> 15:04.521
Yeah, I-- I'm... I'm sorry,
I'm just nervous. I, um...

15:05.869 --> 15:08.193
Today's the day. I decided I am...

15:09.468 --> 15:15.448
I'm just tired of being
"tuesday afternoon Tess."

15:16.174 --> 15:18.044
I'm tired of being the other woman.

15:19.017 --> 15:22.370
I want to be mrs. Frank Mann.

15:32.713 --> 15:33.620
I should let you get ready.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.195
Oh, yes. I'll take those towels.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.811
The pink one really is the prettiest.

15:45.266 --> 15:47.566
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:16.632 --> 16:18.666
- Room service.
- I'll be out in a minute.

16:28.986 --> 16:30.019
Shh.

16:33.371 --> 16:35.864
Ooh... when I crashed this
funeral a couple weeks ago,

16:35.951 --> 16:37.686
they had these a shrimp puffy things.

16:37.737 --> 16:39.566
Do you have any prawns
with puffy pastry?

16:40.087 --> 16:40.789
No.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.431
"No." God.

16:43.487 --> 16:44.844
Can we get chinese food after this?

16:44.907 --> 16:47.706
What do you think, jacket on or off?

16:47.829 --> 16:48.568
Off.

16:49.478 --> 16:50.250
Actually, on.

16:51.268 --> 16:52.667
I think off, actually.

16:53.105 --> 16:55.146
- Are you fucking with me, Mason?
- Yes.

16:55.207 --> 16:57.195
- Don't fuck with me today, Mason.
- Bloody hell.

16:58.511 --> 17:00.523
Uh... oh.

17:02.233 --> 17:05.304
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:07.934 --> 17:09.297
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:10.137 --> 17:10.808
Thank you.

17:13.078 --> 17:14.732
- Hi, George.
- - Hi.

17:15.170 --> 17:17.683
Um, mason, trip.

17:17.828 --> 17:18.924
Trip, mason.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.986
- Hi.
- Hello.

17:28.502 --> 17:31.858
The death of a loved one

17:32.657 --> 17:34.602
is not a glancing blow,

17:35.220 --> 17:37.576
but a deep and meaningful wound

17:38.354 --> 17:40.853
that we regret most miserably.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.059
Thank you.

17:44.309 --> 17:46.014
You are most humbly welcome, Trip.

17:46.501 --> 17:47.498
Ooh!

17:48.098 --> 17:51.006
When death's dark shadow passes upon us,

17:51.697 --> 17:54.420
we cannot help but search
for that lightness, Trip,

17:54.482 --> 17:58.190
- because in that fucking lightness--
- - there's an open bar, if you'd like.

17:58.277 --> 17:59.669
Thanks, man. Yeah.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.358
I like him. He's cool.

18:11.679 --> 18:16.042
You know, if you keep crashing my
club, people will start to talk.

18:18.101 --> 18:19.322
What will they say?

18:20.201 --> 18:21.337
That you like me.

18:22.249 --> 18:23.349
Uh, Trip?

18:27.226 --> 18:27.839
Oh.

18:28.163 --> 18:30.614
Look, just give me one second, will you?

18:31.789 --> 18:33.205
So let them talk.

18:48.479 --> 18:49.332
Come in.

18:52.933 --> 18:53.751
You're late.

18:54.859 --> 18:56.328
I have a job, Tess.

18:56.851 --> 18:57.628
I know.

18:58.601 --> 19:00.389
I know all about your obligations.

19:00.430 --> 19:01.823
- Don't start.
- I'm not.

19:05.209 --> 19:07.371
Aren't you going to say
something about my outfit?

19:09.154 --> 19:11.268
I told you not to call my house.

19:11.992 --> 19:15.140
Well,  you wouldn't take my calls
at work. What's a girl to think?

19:16.265 --> 19:18.139
You shouldn't have
called my house, Tess.

19:18.482 --> 19:21.202
- Don't be mad, sweetheart.
- I am not your sweetheart.

19:21.391 --> 19:24.070
It's the one thing I told
you not to do. The one thing.

19:24.130 --> 19:27.356
You can't make me wait forever. I'm
not just going to disappear, Frank.

19:28.114 --> 19:29.645
Yes, you are.

19:42.313 --> 19:44.021
Fuck me, you were ugly.

19:44.373 --> 19:46.325
And you look like you were really mean.

19:49.117 --> 19:51.088
No wonder you people drink so much.

19:58.619 --> 20:00.817
- Sorry about that.
- Oh, it's okay.

20:03.816 --> 20:06.321
- Do you talk to dead people?
- What?

20:07.523 --> 20:10.872
Your friend, he was, uh,
talking to a dead woman.

20:12.116 --> 20:14.045
Who do you think you're
talking to, buster?

20:15.562 --> 20:19.592
So, uh, Mason, why did you bring him?

20:19.801 --> 20:21.372
I guess I wasn't sure.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.821
- About?
- You.

20:23.349 --> 20:26.011
He's kind of my insurance policy.

20:29.759 --> 20:33.190
What if I told you that when
we were burying my father,

20:34.450 --> 20:35.960
I flashed on kissing you?

20:36.554 --> 20:39.072
And when I was delivering his eulogy,

20:39.232 --> 20:40.787
I flashed on kissing you.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.931
I know it's not normal, but...

20:44.003 --> 20:48.315
I think... when someone
you really love dies,

20:48.376 --> 20:51.264
you get a pass on normal.

20:52.145 --> 20:52.954
Trip!

20:53.465 --> 20:55.147
Come say hello to the Fergusons.

20:56.563 --> 20:57.567
Who is that?

20:58.616 --> 21:00.756
That's my sister, Ashley.

21:02.312 --> 21:04.837
Look, I'll be back, all right?

21:09.611 --> 21:12.664
George, I think it's a really good
time for us to get out of here.

21:12.993 --> 21:14.498
Because I have to do my reap?

21:14.579 --> 21:17.816
No, because I just stole a really big
diamond off a really little lap dog.

21:18.020 --> 21:19.541
One of those annoying poodles?

21:19.597 --> 21:21.159
No, shih tzu, I think.

21:23.447 --> 21:26.088
If I had coffee after
lunch, I'd be up all night.

21:26.471 --> 21:27.759
I'm up anyway.

21:28.304 --> 21:30.052
- Thanks, Kiffany.
- You're welcome.

21:30.527 --> 21:32.704
- Neighbors?
- Nightmares.

21:35.890 --> 21:37.810
I can remember when coffee was a nickel.

21:38.906 --> 21:41.588
Ten cents and a crying
baby, keep you up all night.

21:44.054 --> 21:47.790
I'm going away for a couple
days. I need you to cover for me.

21:47.861 --> 21:49.749
- Where are you going?
- Away.

21:49.863 --> 21:52.796
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing a little research.

21:52.924 --> 21:54.209
- On what?
- Roxy.

21:54.287 --> 21:56.729
You ask me for a fucking
favor and then you zip up?

21:56.867 --> 21:57.804
I don't think so.

21:59.789 --> 22:01.553
I sent something to
someone a long time ago

22:01.598 --> 22:04.383
and it didn't get to that someone, and
I'm trying to do a little follow-up.

22:04.442 --> 22:08.147
- Were you dead when you sent it?
- Roxy.

22:08.218 --> 22:10.087
Were you dead when you sent it?

22:11.426 --> 22:14.097
- Yes.
- Really?

22:17.179 --> 22:19.530
Is this someone dead or alive today?

22:20.501 --> 22:24.113
Dead, Roxy. Coffee was a nickel.

22:25.392 --> 22:28.883
Now leave me alone and just
let me enjoy my pie in peace.

22:29.034 --> 22:30.657
- Fine.
- Fine.

22:31.270 --> 22:34.703
Do the post-its for
me? I appreciate it.

22:34.827 --> 22:37.121
We have a 187 at the Millstone hotel.

22:39.621 --> 22:40.745
I'll cover for you.

22:48.472 --> 22:49.767
What do you want to do? Movie?

22:49.998 --> 22:51.375
There's nothing good out.

22:52.799 --> 22:55.062
Want to go to the Delaney
house for some fried clams?

22:57.003 --> 22:59.282
I'd rather just watch T.V.

23:00.003 --> 23:00.787
Okay.

23:02.113 --> 23:03.199
So we're eating in.

23:05.850 --> 23:06.921
What do you have?

23:08.370 --> 23:10.396
Whatever the delivery
guy brings to my door.

23:13.649 --> 23:14.416
Dad...

23:15.583 --> 23:17.223
did you and charlotte break up?

23:18.159 --> 23:19.464
Well, why would you ask that?

23:20.970 --> 23:21.829
She cooked.

23:23.914 --> 23:25.977
We did. We broke up.

23:26.035 --> 23:27.155
Did she dump you?

23:27.671 --> 23:31.869
Reggie, people don't dump one
another in a mature relationship.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.078
So she dumped you?

23:34.360 --> 23:35.218
Yes.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.447
Charlotte really liked you, though.

23:37.518 --> 23:39.299
She told me she was
really going to miss you.

23:39.484 --> 23:40.897
I wasn't crazy about her.

23:41.368 --> 23:43.032
So you and your mom
have something in common.

23:46.007 --> 23:48.987
So... no homework ?

23:49.227 --> 23:50.329
Mom's doing it.

23:50.687 --> 23:52.893
You know, because you can do
your homework over here, Reg.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.916
I can help you. I am a teacher.

23:54.993 --> 23:56.688
You couldn't handle it. It's science.

23:56.764 --> 23:58.649
English teachers can do science.

23:58.702 --> 23:59.872
Mom's doing it.

24:00.113 --> 24:03.211
Reggie, I really don't want your
mom doing your homework without you.

24:03.272 --> 24:07.081
It's, well, it's cheating, and
you know how I feel about that.

24:07.291 --> 24:08.126
Okay.

24:08.397 --> 24:09.233
So what's the assignment?

24:09.841 --> 24:11.618
We have to make a model of the heart.

24:11.694 --> 24:12.320
Out of what?

24:12.518 --> 24:13.327
Anything.

24:14.491 --> 24:15.182
Cool.

24:18.941 --> 24:19.744
Lovely.

24:20.901 --> 24:22.022
Do you think they take requests?

24:22.917 --> 24:23.860
I'll ask them.

24:24.777 --> 24:25.830
"Freebird!"

24:26.092 --> 24:28.023
"Freebird--" yeah,
free, freebird!

24:31.740 --> 24:32.793
Can I buy you a drink?

24:34.288 --> 24:36.690
It's a private club. You
don't buy people drinks.

24:37.336 --> 24:38.017
Whoo.

24:38.938 --> 24:40.367
Bitchy heiress.

24:40.630 --> 24:42.338
You're just my type. I love it.

24:42.820 --> 24:43.597
What's your name?

24:43.767 --> 24:45.891
Mason. What's your name? Don't tell me.

24:46.787 --> 24:48.327
Ooh, I love this game.

24:49.824 --> 24:50.852
Whitney?

24:52.481 --> 24:53.449
Parker?

24:54.764 --> 24:56.438
- Whitney?
- You already said that.

24:56.479 --> 24:57.912
- Parker?
- It's Ashley.

24:57.978 --> 24:59.803
Fucking bollocks. Bullshit.
Bullbags. I knew it.

24:59.853 --> 25:02.035
- Why are you here?
- Hesburgh funeral.

25:03.090 --> 25:06.607
- I'm Ashley Hesburgh.
- And I'm very sorry.

25:07.286 --> 25:10.514
- Why are you here?
- I'm with her.

25:11.809 --> 25:12.527
Yeah?

25:13.437 --> 25:15.481
Well, I don't know
her either. Who is she?

25:15.551 --> 25:16.623
She's Trip's girlfriend.

25:16.939 --> 25:17.922
- Really?
- Yes.

25:18.055 --> 25:19.730
And yet I've never seen her before.

25:19.807 --> 25:22.306
Bet there's a lot you
haven't seen before, Whitney.

25:26.959 --> 25:27.691
Sure.

25:28.692 --> 25:29.693
Buy me a drink.

25:30.051 --> 25:31.076
- Really?
- Mm.

25:31.756 --> 25:33.000
- Really?
- Mm.

25:34.030 --> 25:34.614
Whoo.

25:34.711 --> 25:36.774
Another drink for this
young lady, please,

25:36.826 --> 25:37.727
and put it on my tab.

25:41.955 --> 25:43.251
Fucking bollocks.

25:46.180 --> 25:47.450
Why are we here again?

25:47.639 --> 25:49.590
Because I don't want to
have to talk to anybody.

25:50.021 --> 25:50.993
Except you.

25:52.529 --> 25:54.792
My sister and I started
doing this when we were kids.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.472
You know, anything to get away.

25:58.397 --> 26:00.521
It's sweet that you talk to your sister.

26:02.001 --> 26:03.819
I totally ignored mine.

26:05.257 --> 26:07.279
- You don't talk to her anymore?
- Why?

26:08.432 --> 26:10.516
Well, you just-- you
used the past tense.

26:12.358 --> 26:15.599
Well, how about we not
talk about our families?

26:16.738 --> 26:17.483
Deal.

26:19.046 --> 26:20.885
We don't have to talk about anything.

26:24.699 --> 26:26.147
This is so not right.

26:26.343 --> 26:27.919
I have a dead person to deal with,

26:27.995 --> 26:29.598
he's got a dead person to deal with,

26:30.227 --> 26:31.523
but for just a moment,

26:32.209 --> 26:34.385
this was a nice little hiding place.

26:35.512 --> 26:36.331
Trip.

26:37.191 --> 26:38.225
Busted.

26:38.687 --> 26:40.500
I haven't been
introduced to your friend.

26:42.398 --> 26:43.617
I'm sorry.

26:44.231 --> 26:48.252
Um, George, this is my sister, Ashley.

26:48.293 --> 26:50.612
Ashley, this is george.

26:50.894 --> 26:51.554
Hi.

26:53.116 --> 26:56.407
I'm so sorry for your loss.

26:56.927 --> 26:57.870
Thank you.

27:00.292 --> 27:02.577
- Maybe we should...
- Yeah, yeah, that would be...

27:02.773 --> 27:04.706
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

27:05.615 --> 27:09.683
Oh! Found my contact lens.
Thank god. Can't see a thing.

27:11.137 --> 27:14.773
So how long have you two
lovebirds been together?

27:15.725 --> 27:16.687
What's up, Ashley?

27:17.138 --> 27:18.330
Well, I'm just trying to figure out

27:18.388 --> 27:20.160
why you're at our
father's memorial service

27:20.210 --> 27:22.788
doing the hideout routine with
some girl I've never seen before.

27:22.833 --> 27:24.112
Ashley, you're being impolite.

27:24.194 --> 27:26.456
Actually, Trip, you're being impolite.

27:26.585 --> 27:29.519
You have spent all of three
seconds talking to dad's friends.

27:29.596 --> 27:31.747
- I should probably just go.
- Don't be silly.

27:32.013 --> 27:34.598
So, how long have you two been an item?

27:34.650 --> 27:37.172
- That's enough, all right?
- See, because, uh-- oh!

27:37.587 --> 27:40.601
Mason here says that
George is your girlfriend.

27:40.732 --> 27:41.525
Mason.

27:41.745 --> 27:43.036
Yeah, you know what? Actually, she is.

27:43.113 --> 27:45.451
- I am?
- Well, that's nice.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.393
Welcome to the family.

27:47.654 --> 27:48.371
George...

27:49.273 --> 27:52.529
- I didn't catch a last name.
- What is your last name?

27:52.611 --> 27:53.715
No. Don't.

27:54.336 --> 27:55.111
Lass.

27:55.444 --> 27:56.988
Okay, so, she's your girlfriend,

27:57.059 --> 27:58.735
and you don't even know her last name?

27:59.911 --> 28:01.165
George, we have to go now.

28:01.572 --> 28:04.524
Maybe I'm just a
spoilsport, but dad is dead,

28:04.704 --> 28:06.249
and this isn't funny anymore,

28:06.322 --> 28:08.604
and you, little brother,
need to grow the fuck up.

28:14.334 --> 28:15.220
I've got to go.

28:15.354 --> 28:17.652
That's cool... Uh, so do I.

28:19.085 --> 28:20.602
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

28:20.690 --> 28:22.072
Just go do your thing.

28:27.928 --> 28:29.545
You shouldn't not have
told him your last name.

28:29.643 --> 28:30.872
George lass is dead.

28:32.932 --> 28:34.334
I got to go reap somebody.

28:34.940 --> 28:36.422
I don't know what I was thinking.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.784
Who am I kidding? This isn't me.

28:41.125 --> 28:42.766
I had to get out of there.

28:42.901 --> 28:44.517
This place was members only,

28:44.604 --> 28:46.596
and I was, as Mason said,

28:47.210 --> 28:48.768
not really eligible.

28:54.759 --> 28:55.613
What's up?

28:57.766 --> 28:59.381
The oldest story in the world.

28:59.596 --> 29:02.755
Guy's trying to unload his mistress
who got to be a pain in the ass.

29:02.946 --> 29:04.143
Did he leave any prints?

29:04.598 --> 29:05.678
Didn't have to.

29:05.977 --> 29:09.232
We found his name written
on a hotel pad by the phone.

29:09.877 --> 29:12.105
Like she was speaking
to us from the dead.

29:13.546 --> 29:15.008
Pretty handwriting.

29:15.735 --> 29:17.639
Guess he won't be
hurting anybody anymore.

29:19.111 --> 29:20.506
I'll see you later.

29:20.916 --> 29:23.010
We've got things pretty
much wrapped up around here.

29:29.062 --> 29:30.772
Not quite everything.

29:35.968 --> 29:37.362
I got you, sweetheart.

29:38.706 --> 29:39.861
You're okay.

29:41.351 --> 29:42.543
Come with me.

30:05.693 --> 30:07.321
I had it all wrong.

30:07.443 --> 30:09.972
You don't go to a funeral to meet a guy.

30:10.904 --> 30:12.111
You go to a wedding...

30:15.706 --> 30:17.185
where there's lots of guys.

30:18.791 --> 30:19.910
All guys.

30:20.849 --> 30:22.265
All the time.

30:31.634 --> 30:33.531
So, are you with the groom or the groom?

30:33.922 --> 30:34.670
Huh?

30:35.511 --> 30:38.741
I'm just glad that Kyle and Jeffrey
are finally making this official.

30:38.799 --> 30:41.255
No surprises on that wedding
night, you know what I'm saying.

30:43.116 --> 30:45.443
I'm Gordon. Gordon maynard.

30:48.623 --> 30:49.529
I know.

30:49.965 --> 30:50.774
I'm not funny,

30:50.928 --> 30:55.051
but I was just trying to meet
someone, and you seem nice.

30:55.120 --> 30:58.235
I'm kind of here with somebody.

31:01.070 --> 31:02.633
Okay. Nice to meet you.

31:07.111 --> 31:09.405
He didn't seem like
your type anyway, at all.

31:09.472 --> 31:11.160
Oh, yeah. I know.

31:11.263 --> 31:14.269
Gorgeous guys, they're
just so high-maintenance.

31:15.493 --> 31:17.680
Well... you're gorgeous.

31:22.770 --> 31:23.895
You're a girl.

31:24.156 --> 31:24.965
But thank you.

31:25.181 --> 31:26.102
All right. I'll throw it.

31:26.161 --> 31:27.213
We're not throwing it.

31:27.341 --> 31:30.147
Just throw the fucking
thing. It's a photo-op.

31:30.345 --> 31:31.068
Fine.

31:32.073 --> 31:33.086
Here we go!

31:33.201 --> 31:33.878
Honey?

31:34.386 --> 31:35.102
Over the shoulder.

31:35.861 --> 31:36.791
Right.

31:39.204 --> 31:41.062
I've got to catch the
bouquet. It's good luck.

31:41.245 --> 31:42.768
Well, go, give it your best shot.

31:43.249 --> 31:44.698
Mm. What are you doing here?

31:45.648 --> 31:48.774
I, uh, made the wedding cake.

31:56.917 --> 31:57.476
One...

31:57.958 --> 31:58.762
two...

31:59.095 --> 31:59.869
three!

32:18.608 --> 32:20.517
Hi, Gail. It's Joy.

32:21.301 --> 32:24.931
I'm really sorry, but I'm not
going to be able to make it tonight.

32:25.721 --> 32:26.929
Yeah, I know.

32:27.060 --> 32:30.364
I really want to start joining you
guys on these girls' nights out, I do,

32:30.544 --> 32:32.694
but I'm just not feeling well.

32:33.794 --> 32:34.536
Yeah.

32:35.136 --> 32:37.675
Well, we'll do it another time, right?

32:37.747 --> 32:38.416
I promise.

32:39.201 --> 32:41.007
Okay. Yeah, thanks, Gail.

32:41.943 --> 32:44.695
Sometimes, you just have to
lose yourself in your work.

32:45.975 --> 32:48.504
Losing yourself in your
work could be a good thing.

32:50.025 --> 32:53.414
But just being a loser...
not such a good thing.

32:53.501 --> 32:54.136
Gordon?

32:56.237 --> 32:57.218
Are you okay?

32:58.242 --> 32:59.620
He doesn't look good.

33:00.444 --> 33:01.478
He never looked good.

33:01.798 --> 33:03.905
He's not moving. Call an ambulance.

33:04.018 --> 33:04.575
Okay.

33:05.339 --> 33:07.592
What happened? Did I even get it?

33:09.200 --> 33:10.331
You got it.

33:11.929 --> 33:12.746
Great.

33:13.562 --> 33:16.250
They're all hooking up with each
other over my death, and I'm alone.

33:16.602 --> 33:17.936
You're not alone.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.161
I died without a boyfriend.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.503
I don't suppose there's any chance
of getting one on the other side?

33:23.854 --> 33:26.091
That's a good question, Gordon.

33:26.409 --> 33:27.411
What's the answer?

33:27.946 --> 33:30.416
I'm still trying to
figure it out myself.

33:30.714 --> 33:33.305
But for now, I'm here for you.

33:33.965 --> 33:37.846
I know I'm not exactly your type, but...

33:38.297 --> 33:40.775
- I can be bitchy.
- Bitchy's cool.

33:40.994 --> 33:42.987
And hey, you snagged the bouquet.

33:43.362 --> 33:44.154
True.

33:44.829 --> 33:47.282
Gordon, I think you're ready.

33:52.243 --> 33:54.565
Nobody should have to face death alone.

34:06.946 --> 34:08.039
Not in the mood.

34:12.909 --> 34:14.623
You are some kind of fuck-up.

34:14.937 --> 34:16.733
This is some Mason shit.

34:17.445 --> 34:18.654
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:18.725 --> 34:21.176
You leave the soul, and
you finger the murderer.

34:21.237 --> 34:22.504
I did nothing of the kind.

34:22.571 --> 34:24.304
You left the man's name!

34:25.286 --> 34:26.327
No, I didn't.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.406
I know your handwriting, Daisy.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.300
Your silly little curlicues.

34:30.540 --> 34:32.436
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

34:32.568 --> 34:34.331
I just didn't want him
to get away with it, okay?

34:34.380 --> 34:35.617
That's not your job.

34:35.681 --> 34:38.149
Your job is to handle that woman's soul.

34:38.216 --> 34:40.475
Everybody has something
they don't deal with, Roxy.

34:40.534 --> 34:42.590
Rube doesn't do kids. I don't do those.

34:42.650 --> 34:45.447
- Those what?
- Women who end up that way.

34:45.518 --> 34:48.089
Defenseless, with a man coming
at them. I can't watch it.

34:48.135 --> 34:50.532
- That never happened to you.
- I didn't say it happened to me.

34:50.751 --> 34:53.054
Then what are you
feeling so guilty about?

34:53.304 --> 34:55.766
I just feel guilty.
Can't a girl feel guilty?

34:56.143 --> 34:57.880
Maybe you need to go back to church.

34:57.954 --> 34:59.662
Maybe we're done talking about this.

35:07.494 --> 35:08.850
Doesn't that fuck with your sleep?

35:09.018 --> 35:10.099
I'm up anyway.

35:10.965 --> 35:12.055
Can I get you anything?

35:12.161 --> 35:13.033
Coffee.

35:15.350 --> 35:17.617
The cool thing about being a reaper was

35:17.698 --> 35:20.611
you kind of had a second
chance to make things right.

35:21.363 --> 35:23.152
Another whack at the piñata.

35:23.242 --> 35:25.290
See if I could get the
thing to break open...

35:26.755 --> 35:29.759
I don't know. Maybe the
party was already over.

35:35.242 --> 35:36.712
This is going to be beautiful, sweetie.

35:40.048 --> 35:42.965
Maybe the lights went out
and I just couldn't see it.

35:57.937 --> 35:58.684
I don't know.

35:58.736 --> 36:00.373
Being dead, I could handle.

36:00.798 --> 36:03.569
Being totally alone was something else.

36:07.055 --> 36:08.866
Being alone was too much.

36:09.952 --> 36:12.109
Or it was just too much today.

36:13.992 --> 36:16.138
- Oh, my god!
- Hi.

36:16.712 --> 36:19.195
- Who told you where--
- Your friend, Mason.

36:22.974 --> 36:25.450
Mason, Mason, Mason.

36:27.285 --> 36:31.524
Look, at the risk of sounding
completely stalkerish,

36:31.716 --> 36:36.271
I found something of yours, and I just
thought I should give it back to you.

36:38.309 --> 36:39.430
Check it out...

36:39.850 --> 36:41.323
dead Cinderella.

36:42.244 --> 36:44.770
I shouldn't have come today.

36:45.169 --> 36:47.351
No. No. Of course, you should have.

36:48.222 --> 36:50.330
It was just... it was bad timing.

36:50.412 --> 36:51.262
I'm sorry.

36:52.450 --> 36:53.638
About your dad.

36:55.455 --> 36:57.484
You know, they're all
at the house right now.

36:58.927 --> 37:01.528
I just-- I couldn't get
slobbered on by another old lady

37:01.584 --> 37:03.775
telling me what a great man my dad was.

37:05.921 --> 37:08.244
- Does that make me shallow?
- I'm into shallow.

37:09.039 --> 37:11.456
Shallow's the new
deep, haven't you heard?

37:14.139 --> 37:16.073
I just couldn't listen to
one more person telling me,

37:16.160 --> 37:17.943
"do you know how proud your father was?"

37:22.220 --> 37:25.111
- Do you want to kiss me?
- Please.

37:38.955 --> 37:41.919
I mean, I know that he was proud of
me. He told me he was proud of me.

37:41.972 --> 37:44.516
I don't know why I have to listen
to it from so many other people.

37:44.573 --> 37:45.949
Do you want to go back there...

37:46.518 --> 37:47.819
or do you want to be here?

37:49.944 --> 37:50.977
I want to be here.

37:53.363 --> 37:56.097
I wasn't ready for my
death and it came anyway.

37:56.657 --> 37:58.289
And I wasn't ready for this,

37:58.960 --> 38:00.445
but here it came anyway.

38:01.525 --> 38:02.375
Like something,

38:03.387 --> 38:04.970
I don't know, falling on me...

38:05.821 --> 38:07.041
out of the sky.

38:07.659 --> 38:10.669
It was pretty nice to have
someone track me down for once,

38:10.846 --> 38:13.071
to think someone cared that I was gone.

38:17.945 --> 38:21.042
What is this vision of
loveliness I see before me?

38:21.089 --> 38:22.568
Nymph? Angel?

38:24.090 --> 38:25.134
Not tonight.

38:26.316 --> 38:27.749
You're wearing golf shoes.

38:28.046 --> 38:28.754
Shut up.

38:29.470 --> 38:29.966
No way.

38:30.014 --> 38:31.508
Is that what they are? Bloody hell.

38:32.180 --> 38:34.873
They're very smart, aren't they? Lovely.

38:35.317 --> 38:38.322
I have had the most incredible day.

38:38.373 --> 38:39.327
It's been booze,

38:39.394 --> 38:40.294
it's been food,

38:40.364 --> 38:41.700
it's been petty larceny.

38:41.774 --> 38:44.087
It's been absolutely fucking fantastic.

38:44.712 --> 38:46.423
Wish you would have
been there. I missed you.

38:46.561 --> 38:47.245
That's nice.

38:48.077 --> 38:49.397
Kiffany, can I interest you

38:49.484 --> 38:52.572
in a very, very good deal
on a very nice gold watch?

38:55.802 --> 38:57.379
How about a nice bag ?

38:59.520 --> 39:00.261
No.

39:01.131 --> 39:02.472
You can't wear golf shoes in here.

39:02.539 --> 39:03.161
Why not?

39:04.010 --> 39:06.054
- Fucks up the floors.
- Okay.

39:07.057 --> 39:10.482
- You want some more coffee, hon?
- I'm done. Thanks.

39:12.115 --> 39:13.524
She hates me.

39:13.631 --> 39:16.272
She's had a long day, and so have I.

39:17.108 --> 39:17.855
What's wrong?

39:18.042 --> 39:18.807
Nothing.

39:19.279 --> 39:19.903
Really?

39:20.843 --> 39:22.899
I've got something for
you as well, Daisy Adair.

39:23.343 --> 39:24.193
Tah-dah!

39:25.331 --> 39:27.947
Wow. A girl's best friend.

39:27.997 --> 39:29.396
Stolen from man's best friend.

39:29.443 --> 39:31.330
- A dog?
- A really wealthy dog.

39:31.526 --> 39:33.243
I thought it might be too
small to go around your neck,

39:33.341 --> 39:34.402
so you can wear it as a bracelet.

39:35.935 --> 39:38.264
- Here. Let me help you.
- I love it.

39:38.947 --> 39:41.320
I love you loving it... love.

39:41.939 --> 39:43.669
Did I ever tell you I had a sister?

39:45.770 --> 39:46.584
No.

39:48.929 --> 39:52.589
Why don't you tell me all about it?

39:53.017 --> 39:56.182
Kiffany, please could I have a coffee?

39:56.419 --> 39:57.392
One coffee.

40:01.826 --> 40:03.521
So, thanks for sleeping over, Reg.

40:03.631 --> 40:04.324
Sure.

40:04.538 --> 40:05.542
Did you have fun?

40:06.506 --> 40:07.248
Sure.

40:08.794 --> 40:10.474
I'm sorry about Charlotte.

40:11.749 --> 40:13.340
You'll get over getting dumped.

40:14.505 --> 40:15.793
Mom did.

40:18.272 --> 40:19.797
So I'll see you on friday.

40:20.182 --> 40:22.663
Hey, uh... come on
over early if you like.

40:23.262 --> 40:24.174
Okay.

40:25.129 --> 40:26.966
Thanks for helping me with my project.

40:27.144 --> 40:29.033
All right. Thank you, sweetie.

40:41.430 --> 40:43.001
Hi, honey. What is that?

40:44.742 --> 40:46.662
Dad helped me with my heart assignment.

40:50.297 --> 40:53.928
Hey, J.D., Buddy! Come
here. Come on! Up. Yes!

40:53.990 --> 40:54.943
Reggie!

40:56.437 --> 40:58.521
I was up all night working on that.

41:00.174 --> 41:01.311
He wanted to.

41:02.806 --> 41:05.146
So, your father working
on a science project...

41:05.238 --> 41:07.272
well, I'm sure it's very accurate.

41:07.512 --> 41:08.351
It's a poem.

41:09.242 --> 41:10.497
He said for you to read it.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.278
He said the end's the best part.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.651
"Since sweets and beauties
do themselves forsake

41:16.729 --> 41:19.692
"and die as fast as they see others grow

41:20.108 --> 41:24.469
"and nothing 'gainst time's
scythe can make defense

41:25.724 --> 41:30.014
"save breed to brave him
when he takes thee hence."

41:30.598 --> 41:33.976
- What does that mean?
- Shakespeare.

41:34.397 --> 41:35.784
It means that...

41:36.317 --> 41:40.628
it means you should have kids,
because then you're never alone.

41:41.468 --> 41:43.869
Is dad trying to get
back together with you?

41:43.977 --> 41:48.150
No, sweetie. No. He did it for you.

41:49.021 --> 41:50.031
It's about you.

41:51.907 --> 41:53.746
Is that what you made?

41:55.084 --> 41:57.667
Oh, my god! What happened?

42:05.871 --> 42:07.038
J.D. ate it.

42:07.676 --> 42:10.398
Reggie, you have to leave
for school in 10 minutes.

42:10.535 --> 42:13.439
I haven't even had my coffee yet.

42:18.789 --> 42:19.816
I like it.

42:20.458 --> 42:23.970
Okay, I didn't hate
it, but it was weird.

42:24.477 --> 42:27.360
I hadn't exactly been
close to anyone in a while.

42:28.122 --> 42:32.740
Okay, ever... and suddenly,
someone had gotten very close.

42:34.072 --> 42:35.822
And then they disappeared.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.287
Oh, what the fuck?

42:44.861 --> 42:46.156
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:46.581 --> 42:48.325
- Coffee?
- Of course.

42:50.213 --> 42:52.202
- Thought I'd let you sleep.
- Thanks.

42:55.788 --> 42:56.927
So...

42:59.069 --> 42:59.851
So.

43:01.298 --> 43:04.952
I think I know why people use
that stupid phrase "doing it."

43:05.214 --> 43:07.470
Because it's so fucking
hard to talk about.

43:08.233 --> 43:11.572
I hope you know that I wasn't,
you know, planning that.

43:11.668 --> 43:13.564
Oh, no. Me either.

43:14.454 --> 43:16.958
- I was hoping for it.
- Yeah, me too.

43:17.619 --> 43:18.371
Totally.

43:23.198 --> 43:24.479
There we were,

43:24.561 --> 43:26.993
in one of those bubbles
you blow as a kid--

43:27.149 --> 43:30.736
kind of round and perfect
and just a little strange,

43:31.446 --> 43:32.769
floating in the air...

43:35.211 --> 43:36.486
So this was fun.

43:36.886 --> 43:38.197
And there
it goes--

43:38.907 --> 43:39.600
pop.

43:39.885 --> 43:42.963
Yeah. It was... fun.

43:45.219 --> 43:46.875
So I'll... I'll call you.

43:47.218 --> 43:49.230
If you want. I just...

43:49.913 --> 43:52.445
I mean, I know you have
a lot of things to do,

43:52.523 --> 43:55.542
but if you want, you can call.

43:56.143 --> 43:57.114
Okay.

43:58.698 --> 43:59.647
So you're cool?

43:59.723 --> 44:01.697
Oh, yeah. Totally cool.

44:05.129 --> 44:07.656
Oh, my fucking god, that's hot.

44:12.383 --> 44:15.362
So maybe I was a virgin when
it came to the sex thing...

44:15.542 --> 44:16.694
I'll se you.

44:16.816 --> 44:18.408
But he was a virgin too...

44:18.751 --> 44:20.241
first big death.

44:22.052 --> 44:24.845
And you never really know
what death will make you do...

44:27.547 --> 44:29.239
How you try to defy it...

44:30.722 --> 44:32.899
To reach past what's possible.

44:35.943 --> 44:38.147
How you struggle to
fit the pieces together

44:38.209 --> 44:40.395
even though they're way
too broken to bother.

44:41.880 --> 44:42.698
I don't know.

44:44.338 --> 44:47.221
"Since sweets and beauties
do themselves forsake

44:47.312 --> 44:49.846
"and die as fast as they see others grow

44:49.944 --> 44:53.205
"and nothing 'gainst time's
scythe can make defence..."

44:53.298 --> 44:56.159
I do know that, that
morning, I felt like my heart,

44:56.344 --> 45:00.419
or whatever it was that was
in my chest,  was still going.

45:00.803 --> 45:02.642
Nice job, Millie.

45:02.857 --> 45:04.761
You brought her back to life.

45:05.501 --> 45:06.523
Thanks.
