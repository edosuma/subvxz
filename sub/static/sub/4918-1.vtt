02:45.740 --> 02:46.868
Hello.

02:46.908 --> 02:48.910
Hello, sweetie.

02:48.994 --> 02:51.788
Daddy.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.123
It's early.

02:53.248 --> 02:54.791
Yeah, I know.

02:54.874 --> 02:57.420
I just wanted to let you know
I'm sending you something.

02:57.503 --> 03:00.131
Mmm. Does it smell nice?

03:00.214 --> 03:01.340
No,

03:01.424 --> 03:03.217
but it's sparkly.

03:04.302 --> 03:06.512
Does it have a receipt?

03:06.596 --> 03:10.433
I'm sending it
to you from the store.

03:12.685 --> 03:14.103
Why don't you just come by?

03:14.145 --> 03:15.813
We'll have some breakfast, hmm?

03:15.896 --> 03:18.317
Well, it'd be a long trip.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.861
I'm in Venice.

03:23.905 --> 03:26.283
With your parole officer's
approval, of course.

03:26.366 --> 03:28.619
Well, I like the guy, Stella,
you know that,

03:28.702 --> 03:30.746
but we never really connected.

03:30.829 --> 03:33.624
So I think I've paid
my P.O. his last visit.

03:33.707 --> 03:35.334
What are you into, Dad?

03:35.417 --> 03:36.543
Don't break my heart.

03:36.627 --> 03:38.212
You told me you were through.

03:38.296 --> 03:41.049
After this I am, I swear to you.

03:42.842 --> 03:44.552
Is Charlie there?

03:44.636 --> 03:46.304
I'm on a cell phone, darling.

03:46.387 --> 03:49.807
I'll call you tomorrow
from a land line.

03:49.849 --> 03:50.975
I love you.

03:51.059 --> 03:52.644
Go back to sleep. Bye.

03:52.727 --> 03:54.145
D... Dad?

03:59.318 --> 04:00.444
I love you, too.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.577
I sent it.

04:08.661 --> 04:10.204
You're supposed
to do your shopping

04:10.287 --> 04:11.497
after we pull off the job.

04:11.580 --> 04:12.748
I feel so optimistic.

04:12.831 --> 04:14.083
So?

04:14.166 --> 04:15.501
How do you feel?

04:15.584 --> 04:17.086
I'm fine.

04:17.168 --> 04:18.379
Fine?

04:18.462 --> 04:20.382
You know what "fine"
stands for, don't you?

04:20.464 --> 04:22.050
Yeah, unfortunately.

04:22.132 --> 04:23.301
"Freaked out."

04:23.343 --> 04:24.386
- "Insecure."
- "Neurotic."

04:24.469 --> 04:25.971
- And "Emotional."
- Good.

04:26.012 --> 04:28.181
See those columns behind you?

04:29.516 --> 04:31.059
What about them?

04:31.142 --> 04:33.395
That's where they used
to string up thieves

04:33.478 --> 04:34.396
who felt "fine."

04:34.479 --> 04:36.439
Well... after you.

04:43.864 --> 04:45.658
For after the haul.

04:46.701 --> 04:48.452
Hope I get to fire it up.

04:48.536 --> 04:50.121
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

04:50.204 --> 04:51.330
No.

04:51.372 --> 04:52.331
If they're no-shows,

04:52.373 --> 04:53.791
three months of prep
down the tubes

04:53.874 --> 04:55.835
and I dragged you out
of retirement for nothing.

04:55.876 --> 04:57.545
Oh, this is fun.
I like this.

04:57.628 --> 05:00.215
You've taken over the reins,
all the worries.

05:00.299 --> 05:02.843
Me loosey-goosey,
just along for the ride.

05:02.884 --> 05:04.428
I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself, John.

05:04.511 --> 05:05.596
Just remember, a police boat

05:05.679 --> 05:07.639
can get from the station
to our position in seven.

05:07.723 --> 05:09.600
That means you got
four minutes to work your magic.

05:09.683 --> 05:10.892
Now, you told me ten,

05:10.976 --> 05:12.853
and you said I would have five.

05:12.894 --> 05:14.646
When?

05:16.815 --> 05:19.568
Do not be messing
with me right now, okay?

05:19.651 --> 05:21.070
- I will kick your ass.
- Oh, yeah?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.405
Come on, take your best shot.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.406
Come on.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.824
What? Uh-oh.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.419
Come on.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.629
Let's go.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.088
What is it this time?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.548
Da Vinci. Architect.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.800
Engineer. Painter.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.093
Yeah, fascinating.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.303
Hey, look, look. Check this out.

05:44.386 --> 05:48.098
"Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex."

05:49.516 --> 05:51.769
Unlike you, my friend,
I don't need a guidebook.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.103
Can we go? Please?

05:53.187 --> 05:55.606
Right, guv'nor.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.107
Come along,
make yourself useful.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.400
Untie that line.

05:58.442 --> 05:59.568
Today.

05:59.652 --> 06:00.736
Yeah.

06:00.778 --> 06:01.779
Yeah, Gilligan.

06:01.863 --> 06:02.906
If you don't mind.

06:41.153 --> 06:42.280
- We set?
- Yeah. I've enhanced

06:42.363 --> 06:44.616
the viewing matrix to track both
the Cartesian coordinates

06:44.658 --> 06:46.076
and three altitude angles,

06:46.159 --> 06:47.703
the yaw, pitch and roll
to give us

06:47.786 --> 06:49.329
the exact position and
orientation of our baby.

06:49.413 --> 06:50.372
We're in Italy.

06:50.455 --> 06:51.665
Speak English.

06:51.748 --> 06:53.458
Steve, how we looking?

06:53.500 --> 06:58.088
Papa took the boat to work at
8:15, so the garage is empty.

06:58.171 --> 07:02.467
Mama left with daughter
at 8:30 for preschool as usual.

07:02.551 --> 07:04.721
So for the next 45 minutes,

07:04.804 --> 07:06.514
we own this place, gentlemen.

07:06.598 --> 07:08.933
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

07:09.017 --> 07:11.060
Hey, who got you
the beekeepers in Budapest?

07:11.144 --> 07:12.186
They'll be there.

07:12.270 --> 07:13.646
You can trust these guys.

07:13.688 --> 07:16.065
Steve, how many times
do I have to tell you?

07:16.190 --> 07:20.570
I trust everyone... I just don't
trust the devil inside them.

08:08.788 --> 08:09.747
We're in.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.184
Just tell me where to paint.

08:37.192 --> 08:38.902
Your men are still not
in position?

08:38.943 --> 08:40.445
They will be.

08:40.529 --> 08:42.530
Well, you don't know that,
Steve. We should abort.

08:42.614 --> 08:46.410
I'm sorry, John, but I think
that's Charlie's call now.

08:50.957 --> 08:53.334
Our baby's being taken
out of here tonight.

08:53.418 --> 08:54.585
This is our only shot at it.

08:58.089 --> 08:59.257
Charlie?

09:00.925 --> 09:02.051
Keep going?

09:02.135 --> 09:04.053
It's up to you, kid.

09:04.178 --> 09:06.055
It's a go.

09:09.852 --> 09:10.811
Okay, Steve.

09:12.646 --> 09:16.817
From the west wall,
measure 14 feet, eight inches.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.068
Got it.

09:18.152 --> 09:19.820
Now measure
eight feet, five inches

09:19.903 --> 09:21.447
from the north wall.

09:21.530 --> 09:23.240
That's the northwest corner
of our baby.

09:24.617 --> 09:25.618
Got it.

09:25.701 --> 09:26.744
Well, it's right above you.

10:00.029 --> 10:01.113
Now, paint.

10:01.238 --> 10:04.492
Two feet, nine inches wide.

10:04.575 --> 10:06.661
Two feet, five inches deep.

10:06.744 --> 10:08.955
Okay, Left Ear.
You're up.

10:10.374 --> 10:12.668
14 feet four inches
from that west wall.

10:38.569 --> 10:39.946
Yeah.

10:42.198 --> 10:43.116
Bene.

10:44.409 --> 10:46.911
The garbagemen
are in position, John.

12:49.873 --> 12:51.417
All right, Charlie,
someone just called it in.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.169
The police boat's
heading your way.

12:54.253 --> 12:55.839
Seven minutes and counting.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.173
Let's go.

14:17.006 --> 14:19.843
We got four minutes
to load and leave. Let's go.

14:54.754 --> 14:55.797
Whoa! Whoa!

17:30.585 --> 17:32.086
Hey, you guys. Come here.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.509
I want to propose a toast.

17:38.593 --> 17:40.511
To us.

17:40.595 --> 17:41.554
Yay!

17:44.933 --> 17:47.519
And I want to propose
a toast to Charlie

17:47.603 --> 17:51.023
because we just stole
$35 million worth of gold

17:51.065 --> 17:52.983
without even holding a gun

17:53.025 --> 17:54.652
because he planned this
down to a "T."

17:54.735 --> 17:56.987
Nobody else
could have done that.

17:57.029 --> 17:58.072
Nobody. Charlie!

17:58.155 --> 17:59.865
- Charlie!
- Yay!

17:59.948 --> 18:01.659
Thank you.

18:01.742 --> 18:02.993
So, come on, gentlemen.

18:03.035 --> 18:04.788
Shopping list.
Who's doing what?

18:04.871 --> 18:06.081
Spare no dirty details.

18:06.206 --> 18:07.499
Come on, you guys.

18:07.540 --> 18:09.751
Take a lesson from an old man.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.544
Don't spend it.
Invest.

18:13.046 --> 18:14.339
In what?

18:14.422 --> 18:16.299
In gold.

18:18.301 --> 18:19.636
Let's figure out

18:19.719 --> 18:21.846
how to get out of here first,
all right?

18:21.888 --> 18:23.974
What are you getting, Rob?

18:24.057 --> 18:25.351
I don't know...
there's a lot of things

18:25.393 --> 18:26.519
you can buy with a lot of money.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.312
You know, I'm just thinking
about naked girls

18:28.396 --> 18:29.522
in leather seats.

18:29.605 --> 18:31.107
Obviously. See?

18:31.190 --> 18:33.359
Suppose I get
the Aston Martin Vanquish?

18:33.401 --> 18:34.694
There's not a lot
a girl won't do

18:34.735 --> 18:36.779
on the passenger seat
of one of those things.

18:36.862 --> 18:38.531
I'm going to get a NAD T770

18:38.614 --> 18:41.409
digital decoder with a 70-watt
amp and Burr Brown DACs.

18:42.493 --> 18:43.369
Yeah.

18:43.411 --> 18:44.537
It's a big stereo.

18:44.578 --> 18:46.790
Speakers so loud they blow
women's clothes off.

18:46.873 --> 18:48.041
Now you're talking.

18:49.626 --> 18:52.129
$35 million... you can't get
more creative than that, man?

18:52.254 --> 18:54.381
I'm going to Andalucia,
south of Spain...

18:54.423 --> 18:55.924
right there.

18:55.966 --> 18:57.551
Get me a big house...

18:57.592 --> 18:59.219
get me a library
full of first editions.

18:59.303 --> 19:00.595
Get a room for my shoes.

19:00.679 --> 19:02.639
What about you, Steve?

19:02.723 --> 19:05.058
I don't know...
I haven't decided yet.

19:05.225 --> 19:06.936
You haven't decided yet?

19:07.020 --> 19:08.896
Come on, man,
is it the mountain air, just...?

19:08.938 --> 19:09.897
I liked what you said.

19:09.939 --> 19:11.441
I'll take one of each of yours.

19:13.109 --> 19:14.736
Well, well, two of everything

19:14.777 --> 19:16.237
- For Steve then.
- Two of those.

19:16.279 --> 19:17.322
Oy!

19:22.618 --> 19:24.412
Loved the toast.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.664
But you could've pulled this off
with your eyes closed.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.084
No, you were incredible.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.586
Just incredible.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.087
You saw the whole picture.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.422
You covered all the angles.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.258
You know, Charlie,

19:36.300 --> 19:39.428
there are two kinds of thieves
in this world:

19:39.470 --> 19:42.097
the ones who steal
to enrich their lives,

19:42.139 --> 19:46.101
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.104
Don't be the latter.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.273
Makes you miss out
on what's really important

19:50.315 --> 19:52.108
in this life.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.611
What are you talking about,
John?

19:54.653 --> 19:56.112
You've been a good father.

19:56.154 --> 19:59.783
Sitting in prisons
doesn't make you a good father.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.369
I spent half my kid's life
in prison.

20:02.452 --> 20:06.373
Don't get to be my age
with nothing but this, Charlie.

20:06.456 --> 20:10.419
Find somebody you want to spend
the rest of your life with

20:10.503 --> 20:12.588
and hold onto her forever.

20:12.672 --> 20:15.675
- Okay?
- Hey.

20:15.758 --> 20:17.802
Let's go...
I'm freezing my ass off.

20:17.843 --> 20:20.137
Yeah.

20:20.179 --> 20:22.139
Steve's getting cold.

20:22.181 --> 20:23.641
You, too?

20:23.683 --> 20:24.809
I'm all right.

20:26.185 --> 20:27.478
I love you, kid.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.939
You did really great.

20:29.022 --> 20:31.483
Thanks, John.

20:31.525 --> 20:34.945
Let's go.

20:43.161 --> 20:46.331
Money

20:46.373 --> 20:48.959
It's a gas

20:49.042 --> 20:56.175
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

20:56.342 --> 20:59.721
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream...

20:59.804 --> 21:01.597
You should've seen Rob
behind the wheel of that boat.

21:01.681 --> 21:03.308
He was like Don Johnson.

21:03.391 --> 21:05.393
Oy, yeah, from Brixton.

21:05.476 --> 21:07.562
Yeah, what the hell do you know
about Brixton, eh?

21:13.736 --> 21:16.613
Look at this idiot
right in the middle of the road.

21:16.697 --> 21:18.198
What's this, what's this?

21:21.243 --> 21:23.203
Who the hell are these guys?

21:26.999 --> 21:27.666
Hey!

21:27.750 --> 21:28.834
Take your hands off the wheel.

21:28.917 --> 21:29.543
Steve!

21:32.922 --> 21:34.883
Don't even think about it...
just do it.

21:40.263 --> 21:41.097
No, no, no, no,

21:41.181 --> 21:42.390
- No, no, no, no, John.
- Steve,

21:42.432 --> 21:43.391
what the hell are you doing?

21:43.433 --> 21:44.809
Made a few plans of my own.

21:48.104 --> 21:50.482
There's nowhere you can go
where we won't find you, Steve.

21:50.565 --> 21:51.484
You know that.

21:51.567 --> 21:52.777
I think that's probably right,
John.

21:53.944 --> 21:54.403
Go! Go!

23:38.721 --> 23:41.807
Charlie.

23:41.891 --> 23:44.852
We got to go, Charlie.

25:08.648 --> 25:10.317
You always work in the dark?

25:10.400 --> 25:13.069
Makes me feel like I'm alone.

25:15.447 --> 25:16.364
Not bad.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.117
Not bad, Stella.

25:18.242 --> 25:19.952
Damn. Hurley couldn't
crack that safe.

25:20.036 --> 25:21.287
Neither could Spears.
Now you know

25:21.329 --> 25:22.288
who to call first.

25:22.330 --> 25:23.331
You're expensive, Stella.

25:23.372 --> 25:26.125
Those guys cut us a break
on subpoena jobs.

25:26.292 --> 25:27.960
Good will, community service.

25:28.002 --> 25:30.129
I do it for the money, Paul.

25:30.171 --> 25:31.672
I'll be sending you a bill.

25:31.756 --> 25:33.549
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

25:33.632 --> 25:34.633
I never look inside.

25:35.676 --> 25:37.303
Have a good day.
Hey, George.

25:37.386 --> 25:38.429
Hi, Stella.

25:38.512 --> 25:41.391
I came, I saw, I kicked some ass

25:41.475 --> 25:44.645
The pain I cause,
it makes me laugh

25:44.686 --> 25:46.355
'Cause the way I do my thing
is strange

25:46.438 --> 25:49.149
Time, time for this girl
to sing

25:49.191 --> 25:51.943
Damn if I thought
that you would change

25:52.027 --> 25:54.154
And my life would stay
the same

25:54.279 --> 25:56.657
Things will come
and things will go

25:56.698 --> 25:59.034
And one thing I know
for sure

25:59.117 --> 26:03.081
Is that the wreckoning,
the wreckoning, the wreckoning

26:03.164 --> 26:04.749
I'm walking out the door

26:04.832 --> 26:08.044
Wreckoning, the wreckoning,
the wreckoning

26:08.127 --> 26:09.879
Oh, it's time...

26:13.383 --> 26:14.342
How long to crack it?

26:14.384 --> 26:16.803
Four minutes and 43 seconds.

26:16.886 --> 26:17.804
Oh! You're the man.

26:17.887 --> 26:18.846
What's on the lineup?

26:18.930 --> 26:20.057
Todd Milliken called.

26:20.140 --> 26:21.642
He has a prototype
combination lock.

26:21.725 --> 26:23.060
He wants you to test out.

26:23.143 --> 26:24.269
He says he added

26:24.353 --> 26:27.314
two false contact points
on the tumbler.

26:27.398 --> 26:29.149
I'll pretend to be stumped
for a couple of seconds,

26:29.274 --> 26:30.359
give him a thrill.

26:30.401 --> 26:32.653
And, there's a Charlie Croker
in your office.

26:33.821 --> 26:35.948
Says you two know each other.

26:38.909 --> 26:41.746
Charlie Croker.

26:41.830 --> 26:43.373
Hey, Stella.

26:46.376 --> 26:48.336
Didn't I tell you I never
want to see you again?

26:49.754 --> 26:52.007
I think it was when you told me
how my father died,

26:52.090 --> 26:53.508
right in front of your eyes,

26:53.591 --> 26:55.427
after you pulled him
in for one last job.

27:00.390 --> 27:01.851
We found him, Stella.

27:01.934 --> 27:04.687
He's in Los Angeles.

27:04.770 --> 27:05.813
The gold bricks he stole from us

27:05.896 --> 27:07.231
had a Balinese dancer
stamped on them.

27:07.273 --> 27:08.524
I just got word,

27:08.607 --> 27:09.942
from a contact of mine
called Skinny Pete,

27:10.026 --> 27:12.361
that a gold dealer out in L.A.
has been buying those bricks.

27:12.445 --> 27:14.071
Yeah?

27:14.113 --> 27:15.489
Well, how do you know it's him?

27:16.782 --> 27:19.285
Skinny Pete sent me this.

27:19.368 --> 27:21.537
Steve changed his last
name to Frazelli.

27:27.627 --> 27:29.504
Why you telling me
all of this?

27:29.588 --> 27:31.757
Been checking out the databases
behind safe companies.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.383
Found out Steve
had a Worthington 1000

27:33.467 --> 27:34.926
delivered to his home office.

27:34.968 --> 27:36.428
You don't install
a Worthington 1000

27:36.470 --> 27:38.096
unless you've got something
really big to guard.

27:38.138 --> 27:39.139
No, you don't.

27:39.264 --> 27:40.140
The problem now is no one

27:40.265 --> 27:41.475
in my crew
can handle Steve's safe.

27:41.558 --> 27:43.644
And I need somebody
I can trust.

27:43.728 --> 27:45.313
Look, I'm a professional
safe and vault technician.

27:45.396 --> 27:46.648
I'm not a thief.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.608
Hey, it's not about the gold,
Stella, okay?

27:48.650 --> 27:49.901
John was like a father
to me, too.

27:55.615 --> 27:56.866
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

27:56.949 --> 27:58.868
I just can't move on until
I've set things right.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.502
I've moved on.

29:11.194 --> 29:12.321
Come on, Charlie.

29:13.405 --> 29:14.406
Come on.

29:20.370 --> 29:21.621
Hello?

29:21.705 --> 29:23.540
I want to see the look
on that man's face

29:23.623 --> 29:24.958
when his gold is gone.

29:25.042 --> 29:28.212
He took my father from me;
I'm taking this.

29:32.759 --> 29:33.676
She's in.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.386
That's a good thing?

29:35.428 --> 29:36.512
It's a very good thing.

29:36.596 --> 29:38.431
She can crack a Worthington 1000
without even flinching.

29:38.514 --> 29:40.016
I'm not sure having
a civilian on the crew's

29:40.099 --> 29:41.142
a good idea, Charlie.

29:41.267 --> 29:42.143
She's got the skill

29:42.268 --> 29:43.353
and she's got the motivation.

29:43.436 --> 29:44.854
Exactly.

29:44.937 --> 29:46.147
She's emotional.

29:46.272 --> 29:48.442
You know what happens
when emotion gets into it.

29:48.525 --> 29:50.069
Look, don't kid yourself,
all right?

29:50.152 --> 29:51.570
We're all emotional on this one.

29:51.612 --> 29:53.864
Let's go.

29:53.947 --> 29:55.449
Are you ready?

29:55.532 --> 29:56.617
Of course I am.

29:59.244 --> 30:00.788
You're not ready.

30:24.979 --> 30:27.565
That was quick.

30:27.650 --> 30:28.693
Where are they?

30:28.776 --> 30:29.944
We're a little early.

30:30.027 --> 30:32.613
I didn't expect us to get here
quite that fast.

30:33.823 --> 30:34.865
There.

30:34.949 --> 30:35.992
That's Lyle.

30:36.075 --> 30:37.702
He's my computer genius.

30:42.248 --> 30:45.167
You know, he's who really
invented Napster.

30:45.251 --> 30:46.627
At least that's how
Lyle tells it.

30:46.711 --> 30:49.840
Said Shawn Fanning
was his roommate in college

30:49.923 --> 30:51.758
and stole his idea.

31:04.062 --> 31:06.648
Think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

31:09.402 --> 31:10.361
Hey.

31:12.321 --> 31:13.448
Oh...

31:14.824 --> 31:16.117
You okay?

31:17.535 --> 31:18.953
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

31:20.038 --> 31:21.122
That's Left Ear.

31:21.748 --> 31:23.166
Demolition and explosives.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.167
When he was ten,

31:24.334 --> 31:26.169
he put one too many M-80s
in the toilet bowl.

31:26.210 --> 31:28.838
Fire...

31:28.921 --> 31:30.632
Whoa.

31:30.716 --> 31:31.800
Yeah, that was cool.

31:31.884 --> 31:33.052
How'd you do that?

31:33.135 --> 31:34.178
What?!

31:34.219 --> 31:35.512
How'd you do that?

31:35.596 --> 31:36.597
What?!

31:36.680 --> 31:39.016
I said,
how did you do that?

31:39.099 --> 31:41.477
What?!

31:41.560 --> 31:43.187
Lost the hearing
in his right ear.

31:43.228 --> 31:45.439
He's been blowing
stuff up ever since.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.069
Handsome Rob.

31:50.152 --> 31:51.196
Premier wheel man.

31:51.363 --> 31:52.697
Once drove all the way
from Los Angeles

31:52.739 --> 31:54.657
just so he could set the record
for longest freeway chase.

32:03.541 --> 32:05.710
- You're a heartbreaker...
- You know, he got 110

32:05.794 --> 32:07.170
love letters
sent to his jail cell

32:07.253 --> 32:08.838
from women
who saw him on the news?

32:08.922 --> 32:11.050
You're a heartbreaker

32:11.133 --> 32:12.635
Dream-maker

32:12.718 --> 32:13.636
Love-taker

32:13.719 --> 32:15.721
Don't you mess around,
no, no, no...

32:20.643 --> 32:21.894
And you?

32:21.977 --> 32:24.480
I never heard
how you got your start.

32:24.563 --> 32:26.691
Me?

32:26.774 --> 32:29.443
Well, I've been a thief
since I had baby teeth.

32:29.527 --> 32:32.572
Okay, you both know what to do.

32:32.656 --> 32:34.074
Cough it up, now!

32:34.116 --> 32:37.994
Come on, now,
shake it, shake it, baby, ho!

32:38.078 --> 32:39.997
One, two, three, baby...

32:40.872 --> 32:42.040
Watch it, spaz!

32:42.124 --> 32:43.792
Hey, now, do, re, me, baby...

32:43.875 --> 32:44.835
Hey, what's your problem, man?

32:44.918 --> 32:47.379
A-B-C, it's easy

32:47.462 --> 32:49.214
As one, two, three...

32:50.298 --> 32:51.216
Hey, Charlie.

32:51.299 --> 32:52.427
Good to see you, man.

32:52.468 --> 32:53.678
- Looking good.
- Yeah?

32:53.761 --> 32:56.139
- Charlie Hustle.
- Good to see you.

32:56.222 --> 32:57.140
Hello, Charlie.

32:57.223 --> 32:58.808
Rob, what's up?
Good?

32:58.891 --> 33:00.393
Guys...

33:00.476 --> 33:01.561
Stella Bridger.

33:01.644 --> 33:03.855
Hi.

33:03.938 --> 33:04.856
How you doing?

33:04.939 --> 33:06.065
Nice to meet you.

33:06.149 --> 33:07.150
Phones?

33:07.275 --> 33:08.443
Yeah, they're all
fresh and clean,

33:08.484 --> 33:09.944
I got internal chips in them.

33:09.986 --> 33:11.112
Please change them twice a day.

33:11.154 --> 33:12.906
We will get heat on line.

33:12.990 --> 33:14.158
I.D. s?

33:16.702 --> 33:18.037
"James Hymen?"

33:18.120 --> 33:20.331
Come on, man, one time,
give me a cool name.

33:20.414 --> 33:22.583
140 pounds? Try 165.

33:22.666 --> 33:23.917
Try lifting some weights.

33:24.001 --> 33:25.419
- Try lifting up these.
- Guys, enough.

33:25.502 --> 33:26.920
Come on, we leave
tomorrow, all right?

33:27.004 --> 33:27.921
Let's go.

33:28.005 --> 33:29.089
Hey, Charlie...

33:30.382 --> 33:32.176
Handsome, can you help
him with the bike?

33:32.259 --> 33:35.472
Yeah, help Knievel set up
for his next jump.

33:36.890 --> 33:39.059
Like a sound you hear
that lingers in your ear

33:39.142 --> 33:43.730
But you can't forget,
from sundown to sunset

33:43.813 --> 33:46.649
No, no

33:46.691 --> 33:49.194
It puts a brand-new kind
of thinkin' in your mind

33:49.361 --> 33:50.653
And you can't go wrong

33:50.695 --> 33:55.451
'Cause you're groovin'
all day long, ha-ha!

33:55.534 --> 33:57.995
California soul

33:58.079 --> 34:00.748
Ooh-ooh-ooh

34:00.831 --> 34:04.794
California soul...

34:04.877 --> 34:07.546
Man, out of all of the places
for a thief to hide,

34:07.630 --> 34:09.297
this joker picked Hollywood.

34:09.382 --> 34:11.634
He's a punk,
but he ain't stupid.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.177
All right...

34:13.302 --> 34:15.013
we need to figure out a way
to get in Steve's house

34:15.097 --> 34:16.848
and make a video blueprint
of the interior.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.016
I want audio surveillance
on his phone.

34:19.101 --> 34:20.601
Oh, yeah, I been wanting
to try something.

34:20.686 --> 34:22.103
I crack into the phone company's

34:22.187 --> 34:23.938
remote monitoring system,
and fool it into thinking

34:24.022 --> 34:25.023
there's a legal tap on the line.

34:25.107 --> 34:26.065
Just reroute the digital copies

34:26.149 --> 34:27.609
of the calls to our own
listening post.

34:27.693 --> 34:29.027
I been doing it
to my ex for years.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.570
How long?

34:30.654 --> 34:32.280
No... how long will it take?

34:32.364 --> 34:33.864
Not how long have you
been doing it to your ex.

34:33.949 --> 34:35.702
I'll burn through the night;
I'll have it running by morning.

34:38.621 --> 34:39.871
Sorry I'm late.

34:39.956 --> 34:41.748
We got to work on getting
Steve out of the house.

34:41.833 --> 34:43.501
Stella, how much time you need
with the Worthington?

34:43.583 --> 34:46.045
Five minutes flat.

34:46.087 --> 34:47.588
Don't be cocky, young lady.

34:47.630 --> 34:49.757
It's not the same as opening
a safe for the police.

34:51.134 --> 34:52.760
The perspiration
on your fingertips,

34:52.844 --> 34:54.303
your heart's pounding
in your ears...

34:54.387 --> 34:55.429
whole different ball game.

34:57.056 --> 34:58.976
I appreciate your concern.
I'll be fine.

35:00.686 --> 35:01.854
Look, just remember,

35:01.937 --> 35:02.980
this is all the easy part, okay?

35:03.063 --> 35:04.314
It's the getaway
that can get us caught.

35:04.398 --> 35:05.524
So what's the sketch?

35:05.607 --> 35:06.608
We drive to Union Station.

35:06.692 --> 35:09.486
Getaway car goes
right onto the train with us.

35:09.570 --> 35:11.155
We need to know exactly
how long it's going to take

35:11.280 --> 35:13.282
to get from Steve's house
to Union Station.

35:43.689 --> 35:45.483
Oh, great.

35:45.566 --> 35:46.901
Carson Security System.

35:46.984 --> 35:48.819
How good is it?

35:48.903 --> 35:50.571
Carson's held
an annual contest...

35:50.654 --> 35:53.199
$50,000 to anybody
that can bypass the system.

35:53.324 --> 35:55.785
The Who's Who of ex-cons
always show up.

35:55.826 --> 35:58.997
Five years running,
no one's been paid.

35:59.081 --> 36:01.666
Okay, party people,
here's the status.

36:01.750 --> 36:03.043
It's an anti-scaling fence.

36:03.126 --> 36:05.087
It's hardened,
electro-plated steel.

36:05.170 --> 36:07.130
Yeah, I'm going
to have to paint that up

36:07.214 --> 36:08.298
with some nitromin.

36:08.382 --> 36:09.633
Security on the property?

36:09.716 --> 36:11.093
Got an armed guard here.

36:11.176 --> 36:12.135
Little rent-a-cop,

36:12.219 --> 36:13.637
with a nine-millimeter
on his hip.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.138
But that booth...

36:15.180 --> 36:18.141
Security booth looks prime
for a chemical grenade.

36:18.183 --> 36:19.560
Nitromin, chemical grenades...

36:19.644 --> 36:21.771
I mean, that stuff's
pretty hard to come by.

36:21.854 --> 36:23.648
Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market.

36:25.525 --> 36:27.151
Shit.

36:28.695 --> 36:29.987
This dude got dogs.

36:30.029 --> 36:31.823
I don't do dogs.

36:31.906 --> 36:34.409
I had a...
real bad experience, man.

36:34.492 --> 36:35.743
What happened?

36:35.827 --> 36:38.996
I had a bad experience.

36:39.080 --> 36:40.833
Damn it. I'm deaf.

36:55.931 --> 36:57.182
You turn in your badge

36:57.349 --> 36:59.351
and your weap...
Oh, shoot.

36:59.435 --> 37:01.730
Turn in your badge
and your weapon!

37:02.814 --> 37:03.732
Crush.

37:03.815 --> 37:04.816
I don't want to see you

37:04.899 --> 37:07.068
anywhere near
this investigation.

37:07.152 --> 37:09.988
And turn in
your badge and your weapon.

37:10.071 --> 37:10.989
I don't want to see you

37:11.072 --> 37:12.615
anywhere near
this investigation.

37:14.993 --> 37:16.995
Hey! It's a green!

37:17.078 --> 37:19.664
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

37:19.748 --> 37:21.542
- Green!
- I don't want to see you

37:21.584 --> 37:22.334
anywhere near this...

37:23.711 --> 37:24.920
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

37:27.673 --> 37:30.468
Unbelievable.

37:42.105 --> 37:44.107
There he is.

38:02.877 --> 38:05.505
Let's get to work.

38:07.882 --> 38:11.969
It's either bad traffic,
peak traffic,

38:12.053 --> 38:13.471
slit-your-wrist traffic.

38:13.554 --> 38:15.765
You know, five people died
from smoking

38:15.848 --> 38:17.141
in between traffic lights today.

38:17.225 --> 38:19.143
You know, they do have
the Metrorail, Rob.

38:19.227 --> 38:20.520
You could always use that.

38:20.603 --> 38:21.729
That'd be ideal

38:21.813 --> 38:23.732
for carrying a ton of gold,
wouldn't it, genius?

38:24.775 --> 38:25.943
What's your guesstimate?

38:25.984 --> 38:28.487
The last 20 times
I've done the journey,

38:28.570 --> 38:31.657
you've got an average of 32
minutes and a top time of 50,

38:31.740 --> 38:33.659
but if we had green
lights all the way,

38:33.742 --> 38:35.327
we could do it in 14 minutes.

38:35.411 --> 38:37.579
Wait, you couldn't get
through traffic?

38:40.958 --> 38:41.834
Whoa.

38:43.336 --> 38:46.673
We could do anything
with green lights all the way.

38:46.756 --> 38:48.633
Lyle?

38:48.675 --> 38:50.510
Lyle?

38:51.928 --> 38:53.430
I'll see what I can do.

38:57.767 --> 38:59.728
You're right on time.

39:05.026 --> 39:06.819
All these poor bastards
out there,

39:06.861 --> 39:08.654
putting their life
savings in banks,

39:08.696 --> 39:10.656
and S&Ls, and mutual funds.

39:10.698 --> 39:12.992
How do they think,
when the collapse comes,

39:13.034 --> 39:14.827
they can depend
on the government?

39:14.869 --> 39:16.162
I don't think so.

39:16.245 --> 39:17.580
Are you taping me?

39:17.663 --> 39:19.331
Of course not.

39:19.373 --> 39:21.042
I never tape you...
come look,

39:21.125 --> 39:22.209
see for yourself.

39:24.713 --> 39:27.841
Governments are nothing more
than puppets and strings

39:27.883 --> 39:31.386
in a world where NAFTA
can overrule the Supreme Court.

39:32.471 --> 39:33.555
Like my cousin Mashkov

39:33.638 --> 39:36.725
always says: "This
is our only refuge, baby...

39:36.808 --> 39:39.811
gold."

39:45.902 --> 39:49.030
Every time I look
at these engravings...

39:49.072 --> 39:51.866
She's so beautiful.

39:51.908 --> 39:54.035
Where'd you say you got these?

39:54.077 --> 39:55.203
I didn't.

40:01.584 --> 40:03.127
A little walking around money.

40:13.389 --> 40:15.349
I guess I'm not walking
as far as I thought.

40:15.432 --> 40:16.392
I'm... sorry.

40:16.433 --> 40:17.935
I can only buy two bricks
from you today.

40:17.976 --> 40:19.895
- That wasn't the agreement.
- What can I say?

40:19.937 --> 40:21.230
I'm just middleman.

40:21.271 --> 40:23.565
I'll buy the other two
from you on Wednesday.

40:23.607 --> 40:25.109
Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

40:36.287 --> 40:37.247
So, what does a man

40:37.372 --> 40:40.250
with 35 million dollars worth
of gold do at night?

40:42.961 --> 40:45.547
He watches his big-ass TV.

40:47.967 --> 40:50.094
That's our in.

41:12.826 --> 41:13.744
Stella.

41:13.827 --> 41:15.704
Jesus!

41:15.787 --> 41:17.539
Charlie!

41:17.622 --> 41:19.041
How did you get in here?

41:19.124 --> 41:20.584
I knocked,
but you didn't answer.

41:20.667 --> 41:23.086
What... so you just
let yourself in?

41:23.170 --> 41:24.379
I was just making sure
you were okay.

41:24.463 --> 41:25.756
I apologize. I just...

41:26.840 --> 41:28.634
- I...
- Don't look.

41:32.972 --> 41:34.307
Okay.

41:37.310 --> 41:38.686
You got a lot of stuff here.

41:38.770 --> 41:41.647
You know,
your dad was old school.

41:41.731 --> 41:43.649
Did the whole thing by touch.

41:43.691 --> 41:45.735
That worked for him;
this works for me.

41:45.818 --> 41:48.780
Technology guarantees speed
and accuracy, you know?

41:48.864 --> 41:51.325
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

41:52.993 --> 41:54.912
Why the headphones?

41:54.995 --> 41:56.747
Just training myself.

41:56.830 --> 41:59.458
Ambient noises, you know,
just in case.

42:02.419 --> 42:04.129
What do you want, Charlie?

42:05.422 --> 42:07.007
We're going to knock out
Steve's cable,

42:07.091 --> 42:08.759
and we need to send in
a repairman.

42:08.842 --> 42:11.179
To get your video blueprint
of the interior.

42:11.346 --> 42:12.680
Yep.

42:12.764 --> 42:15.475
Only problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

42:17.769 --> 42:18.937
Except me.

42:22.607 --> 42:23.775
I'll do it, Charlie.

42:23.858 --> 42:27.278
I'm in all the way,
whatever it takes.

42:28.905 --> 42:29.823
All right.

42:29.906 --> 42:31.367
I'll set it up.

42:31.450 --> 42:32.535
Okay.

42:32.618 --> 42:34.120
Um... you, um...

42:34.203 --> 42:35.788
maybe want to get a drink
downstairs with me

42:35.871 --> 42:36.872
before I go back to my room?

42:39.458 --> 42:42.878
I sh... I should finish
this stuff up, you know?

42:42.962 --> 42:45.005
Just get it all done tonight.

42:45.089 --> 42:46.716
Yeah.

42:46.799 --> 42:47.967
Sorry I scared you.

42:48.050 --> 42:50.052
It's okay.

42:50.052 --> 42:50.094
|

42:50.094 --> 42:51.680
Good night.

42:52.764 --> 42:54.558
Bye.

42:54.641 --> 42:57.227
And then he's just...
the media darling.

42:57.310 --> 42:58.895
He's on the cover
of all the magazines.

42:58.979 --> 43:01.189
I should've been on the cover
of Wired Magazine.

43:01.314 --> 43:02.190
You know what he said?

43:02.315 --> 43:03.650
He said he...
he named it Napster

43:03.734 --> 43:04.943
because it-it was his nickname,

43:05.027 --> 43:07.029
'cause of the nappy hair
under the hat,

43:07.112 --> 43:09.197
but he... it's 'cause
I was napping

43:09.281 --> 43:11.199
when he stole it from me!

43:11.324 --> 43:13.870
He didn't even graduate.

43:13.953 --> 43:16.873
I think it's time to move on,
don't you?

43:16.956 --> 43:17.874
They shut him down.

43:17.957 --> 43:20.918
I wish they'd
do the same to you.

43:21.961 --> 43:23.087
Here... here we go.

43:23.171 --> 43:24.589
Cable chick.

43:36.143 --> 43:37.227
Becky.

43:37.311 --> 43:38.896
Nice name... I wonder
what she calls

43:38.979 --> 43:39.897
the other one.

43:39.980 --> 43:41.231
And it's such a mystery

43:41.315 --> 43:43.108
why you don't have
a girlfriend, Lyle.

43:44.193 --> 43:45.736
So, all we need is a...

43:45.819 --> 43:47.071
service truck like that one,

43:47.154 --> 43:49.114
a work shirt like hers.

43:50.199 --> 43:51.533
You think Stella
can pull it off?

43:51.617 --> 43:53.078
I have my doubts.

43:53.161 --> 43:55.288
There's no talking
to Charlie, though.

43:56.456 --> 43:59.250
You think he's...

43:59.334 --> 44:01.753
mixing business with pleasure?

44:01.836 --> 44:04.047
He should know better.

44:04.130 --> 44:05.757
Only I'm allowed to do that.

44:07.592 --> 44:10.178
Right. Where you going?

44:10.303 --> 44:12.555
To get a work shirt
and a service truck.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.317
Are you kidding me?

44:27.446 --> 44:29.490
How does he do that?

44:29.573 --> 44:30.533
How do you do that?

44:30.616 --> 44:31.826
What are you saying?

44:31.909 --> 44:33.327
Hey, how are you?

44:33.411 --> 44:34.830
Oh, good. I'm good.

44:34.871 --> 44:37.708
Nice to meet you,
I'm... Handsome Rob.

44:37.791 --> 44:39.126
And you are...?

44:39.209 --> 44:40.544
Oh, my name's...
my name's Becky,

44:40.627 --> 44:42.003
but it's written on my shirt.

44:42.045 --> 44:45.048
Listen, I'm going to need
your shirt... and your truck.

44:45.132 --> 44:46.633
Perfect.
I'll give them both to you.

44:46.717 --> 44:48.885
Would you... would you like
my virginity as well?

44:48.969 --> 44:50.470
If it's on the menu.

44:50.554 --> 44:52.055
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
oh, you're so witty.

44:52.139 --> 44:53.932
Why don't you
take advantage of me?

44:54.015 --> 44:55.893
Yeah, you're
not too bright, are you?

44:55.977 --> 44:56.894
No.

44:56.978 --> 44:58.187
Perfect.

46:44.340 --> 46:46.050
What can I do for you,
Mr. Frazelli?

46:46.134 --> 46:47.385
The cable's out.

46:47.468 --> 46:48.886
The TV, the modem, everything.

46:48.970 --> 46:51.222
Now, get somebody up here,
and tell them to hurry up.

46:57.019 --> 46:58.814
Netcom Cable,
how can I help you?

46:58.897 --> 47:01.316
Hi, I'm up at 3320 East Skyway,
and the cable's

47:01.358 --> 47:02.985
just gone out...
our modem, everything.

47:03.068 --> 47:04.653
Okay, um, let's see, sir.

47:04.737 --> 47:06.739
I have a Thursday
between 9:00 and 3:00

47:06.822 --> 47:07.906
if that would be good.

47:07.990 --> 47:09.491
That's going to work. Thank you.

47:09.575 --> 47:12.202
Guard just called
the cable company.

47:13.495 --> 47:15.622
What time's the appointment?

47:15.706 --> 47:17.624
Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00.

47:26.926 --> 47:27.844
Hello?

47:27.927 --> 47:29.304
Hi, I'm calling
from Netcom Cable.

47:29.387 --> 47:30.680
I understand your service
is out,

47:30.764 --> 47:32.474
and there was an appointment
set up for Thursday.

47:32.557 --> 47:33.475
Yes.

47:33.558 --> 47:34.809
Well, we have
a technician working

47:34.893 --> 47:36.436
in your area who's finished
with an appointment

47:36.519 --> 47:37.437
earlier than expected.

47:37.520 --> 47:39.022
Will somebody be there
for the next hour?

47:39.105 --> 47:40.357
Sure, that'd be great.

47:40.441 --> 47:42.860
All right, our technician
will see you then.

47:42.902 --> 47:43.903
Have a nice day.

47:45.279 --> 47:47.031
Here's all the paperwork
you need.

47:47.114 --> 47:50.034
Just get him to sign
and date at the bottom.

47:50.117 --> 47:52.578
Let's check out the camera.

47:54.914 --> 47:58.709
Stella,
you'll be going patriotic today.

48:00.754 --> 48:02.130
Make sure you walk slowly,

48:02.214 --> 48:03.632
or the image will streak.

48:03.715 --> 48:04.633
- Ow.
- Ooh.

48:04.716 --> 48:06.176
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

48:07.469 --> 48:08.970
Sorry... Couldn't pin

48:09.054 --> 48:10.514
the corsage
on my prom date either.

48:10.597 --> 48:11.515
But you had a prom date?

48:11.598 --> 48:13.725
It was his cousin.

48:13.767 --> 48:15.310
There's cable lines

48:15.394 --> 48:17.187
in the kitchen,
living room, bedroom,

48:17.270 --> 48:19.064
and the cable modem on
the computer in the office.

48:19.147 --> 48:21.567
You need to locate
the safe in the office.

48:23.611 --> 48:24.654
Okay.

48:24.737 --> 48:26.364
Just want you to know

48:26.447 --> 48:27.573
I think you're very
brave going in there.

48:27.657 --> 48:28.574
I know it won't be easy.

48:28.658 --> 48:30.410
I second that.

48:32.453 --> 48:34.163
It's going to be fine.

48:35.456 --> 48:37.041
What?

48:37.125 --> 48:39.085
You know what fine stands for?

48:39.168 --> 48:40.169
Freaked Out. Insecure...

48:40.253 --> 48:43.340
Neurotic, and Emotional.

48:48.137 --> 48:49.346
You'll be great.

48:49.430 --> 48:50.556
Yeah.

49:02.151 --> 49:03.486
Morning.

49:03.570 --> 49:04.779
Can I see some I.D.?

49:14.289 --> 49:16.458
Thanks for coming so soon.

49:16.541 --> 49:18.001
Hey, that's part of the job.

49:18.084 --> 49:19.586
All right.

49:50.368 --> 49:52.829
Aston Martin Vanquish.

49:52.871 --> 49:56.625
Looks like that bastard
took my car.

49:59.336 --> 50:02.089
Nasty-ass dogs.

50:02.172 --> 50:04.884
Hey! Hey!

50:10.765 --> 50:11.808
Relax,

50:11.891 --> 50:14.018
Jesus Christ.

50:14.102 --> 50:16.354
Come on,
they won't bother you now.

50:17.397 --> 50:19.524
Come on.

50:21.109 --> 50:22.735
House.

50:22.819 --> 50:24.779
Go on, get out of here.

50:29.827 --> 50:30.911
It's okay,

50:30.994 --> 50:33.664
I'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on my job.

50:37.084 --> 50:38.335
Steve Frazelli.

50:40.003 --> 50:41.380
Becky.

50:44.466 --> 50:46.386
Want to show me that problem?

50:46.469 --> 50:48.096
Yeah, of course.

50:48.179 --> 50:49.389
This way.

50:50.473 --> 50:52.267
You have a really nice house.

50:52.350 --> 50:54.602
Yeah. 1922.

50:54.686 --> 50:57.272
All the original tiles.

50:57.355 --> 50:58.940
Every stone in that courtyard

50:59.023 --> 51:01.735
hauled from some
monastery in Seville.

51:01.818 --> 51:03.236
What a tactic.

51:03.278 --> 51:04.571
Monastery?

51:04.654 --> 51:06.991
Monastery for punk-ass creeps.

51:07.074 --> 51:09.660
You don't seem impressed.

51:09.744 --> 51:12.079
No, it's just that I don't think
lugging a bunch of rocks

51:12.121 --> 51:14.749
from one place to another
is quite... that interesting.

51:14.790 --> 51:17.084
You know, it doesn't quite
do it for me.

51:17.126 --> 51:19.420
What does do it for you?

51:19.462 --> 51:22.757
Um... TVs?

51:22.798 --> 51:24.550
I have a monster TV.

51:25.634 --> 51:26.802
Not working right now, but...

51:26.887 --> 51:28.597
But you know, I should
probably check out

51:28.638 --> 51:30.223
the cable modem, you know.

51:30.348 --> 51:31.767
Yeah? Yeah, right.

51:31.808 --> 51:33.268
Over here.

51:35.353 --> 51:38.774
I paid 30 grand to some punk kid
to put this system in.

51:38.815 --> 51:40.275
One day, it just goes out.

51:40.317 --> 51:43.945
I ought to have him strung up.

51:46.823 --> 51:47.700
Here we go.

51:47.784 --> 51:48.743
There's our baby.

51:49.786 --> 51:51.245
We got him.

51:51.329 --> 51:53.164
Got any, uh, wiring
coming through here?

51:53.247 --> 51:54.791
There's no wiring in here.

51:58.002 --> 51:59.087
Just right here?

51:59.170 --> 52:00.129
Yeah.

52:00.171 --> 52:01.964
Look at that, that's my...

52:02.048 --> 52:03.883
That's my NAD T770.
That's...

52:03.966 --> 52:05.885
That's my stereo.

52:05.968 --> 52:07.428
I bet most of your customers

52:07.512 --> 52:09.765
are pretty surprised when
they go to open the door

52:09.848 --> 52:11.392
for the cable man
and find you standing there.

52:11.475 --> 52:12.643
Oh, yeah.

52:12.726 --> 52:14.603
He's hitting on her.

52:14.686 --> 52:15.771
There's no problem here.

52:15.854 --> 52:17.481
I should maybe
just check the TVs.

52:18.982 --> 52:20.818
Okay.

52:23.654 --> 52:25.072
You know what,
end this shit right now.

52:25.155 --> 52:26.073
I'm going to blow this shit

52:26.156 --> 52:27.574
right off the mountain
right now.

52:27.658 --> 52:29.619
No, no, no.
No, no, hey, hey, hey.

52:34.165 --> 52:36.042
I see you got the AVM processor.

52:36.126 --> 52:37.919
Only the best.

52:38.002 --> 52:39.963
Check the box.

52:45.385 --> 52:48.471
I'm just going to...
reset your system.

52:48.555 --> 52:52.435
Sometimes these things just get
jammed up you know?

52:52.518 --> 52:54.145
That should do it.

52:54.145 --> 52:54.228
|

52:54.228 --> 52:56.105
It's fixed?

52:56.188 --> 52:58.607
Turn her on, let's see.

52:58.691 --> 52:59.775
Now.

53:02.278 --> 53:03.821
Japan's Nikkei index...

53:03.904 --> 53:05.364
Perfect.

53:06.615 --> 53:07.700
...was the ending price

53:07.783 --> 53:09.535
and as you can see,
we've now gone below...

53:09.618 --> 53:12.038
Becky, huh?

53:12.122 --> 53:15.041
Have we met before?

53:15.083 --> 53:17.210
...a loss of 1.1 percent
on the...

53:17.294 --> 53:19.045
No, I don't think so.

53:19.129 --> 53:20.547
If you can just sign there.

53:21.965 --> 53:23.967
So, if I was to ask you
out to dinner...

53:24.050 --> 53:25.719
would I be the first
one of your customers

53:25.761 --> 53:26.887
to ever do that?

53:26.970 --> 53:30.015
What, you asked your last cable
repair guy out for a date?

53:30.098 --> 53:32.060
No, but the last one
was, like, 300 pounds,

53:32.143 --> 53:33.227
had a handlebar mustache.

53:33.311 --> 53:34.395
You know, not really my type.

53:34.479 --> 53:36.981
I don't think it's a good idea.

53:37.065 --> 53:39.233
Why, is that, like,
some, cable company rule?

53:39.400 --> 53:42.070
No, actually, it's just my rule.

53:42.153 --> 53:43.863
I don't go out
with strange men.

53:43.946 --> 53:46.866
I just met you five minutes ago.

53:46.949 --> 53:49.368
So, I guess I have to, like,
sabotage my cable, you know,

53:49.452 --> 53:51.245
till we get to know each other
well enough.

53:53.499 --> 53:55.042
Have a nice day.

53:55.125 --> 53:57.044
Come on,

53:57.127 --> 53:58.504
I'll be a perfect
gentleman, I promise.

53:58.587 --> 54:00.089
I won't even ask you
for your phone number.

54:00.172 --> 54:01.215
I'll just... I'll meet you.

54:01.298 --> 54:03.759
Anywhere you want to go.

54:03.842 --> 54:07.763
Come on, break your rule once.

54:08.847 --> 54:10.599
It's just dinner.

54:15.647 --> 54:18.108
Is that a yes?

54:28.159 --> 54:30.745
Are you okay?

54:30.829 --> 54:33.249
Yeah.

54:33.332 --> 54:35.459
He touched my hand.

54:37.461 --> 54:40.297
He came on to me.

54:43.175 --> 54:45.094
Hey, at least I...

54:45.177 --> 54:47.763
I created a window
of opportunity, right?

54:49.849 --> 54:52.601
When he goes out Friday night,
we go in.

54:52.685 --> 54:54.438
By the time he realizes
you've stood him up,

54:54.479 --> 54:56.273
we'll be long gone
with that gold.

54:56.356 --> 54:58.150
Yeah.

54:59.359 --> 55:01.862
Make sure you shuffle
them cards this time, Left.

55:01.945 --> 55:03.864
Hey, Lyle,

55:03.947 --> 55:06.199
what's the distance between
the front door and the vault?

55:06.283 --> 55:07.534
Don't deal
when my back's turned.

55:07.617 --> 55:10.036
You've got that loser's
paranoia.

55:10.120 --> 55:11.329
Lyle!

55:11.371 --> 55:13.623
He only answers
to The Napster now, Charlie.

55:13.707 --> 55:14.876
No.

55:14.959 --> 55:17.086
I'm not calling you The Napster.

55:17.170 --> 55:18.379
Why not, you call him Left Ear.

55:18.463 --> 55:19.380
Well, I am.

55:19.464 --> 55:21.340
And him, Handsome Rob.

55:21.424 --> 55:22.967
Well, that's because
he is Handsome Rob.

55:23.050 --> 55:25.511
Well, you can call me
The Napster.

55:25.553 --> 55:28.055
Come on, they were at the
same college at the same time.

55:28.139 --> 55:30.308
Why are you encouraging this?

55:30.391 --> 55:32.143
It is a verifiable fact...

55:32.226 --> 55:34.605
he was my roommate,
he stole my ideas.

55:34.688 --> 55:36.440
I am The Napster.

55:37.524 --> 55:40.360
All right, all right.

55:40.444 --> 55:41.612
What is the distance

55:41.695 --> 55:44.531
between the front door
and the vault, Napster?

55:46.283 --> 55:48.660
It's farther
than you want to carry it.

55:48.744 --> 55:50.746
Yeah, but, so,
how do we get the gold

55:50.788 --> 55:52.623
from the vault
to the getaway car?

55:52.706 --> 55:55.251
How wide is the hallway...
Napster?

56:00.423 --> 56:01.966
Six feet.

56:19.568 --> 56:21.112
Okay, you've got your gold.

56:42.759 --> 56:43.927
Whoo!

57:21.091 --> 57:23.135
We need more cars
to handle the weight.

57:23.218 --> 57:25.512
Looks like I'm going to need
some help

57:25.554 --> 57:27.514
with the custom work, too.

57:27.556 --> 57:28.891
I know a man for the job.

57:28.974 --> 57:31.935
So I modified the camera
to include the...

57:32.019 --> 57:34.772
so we can create really
hi-res digital maps.

57:34.855 --> 57:35.898
Who's that?

57:35.981 --> 57:37.858
Rob's mechanic friend.

57:42.530 --> 57:43.782
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

57:43.865 --> 57:45.533
Charlie, this is Wrench.

57:45.575 --> 57:47.077
Hey, what's up, man?

57:47.118 --> 57:48.828
Rob tells me you
got real talent.

57:48.912 --> 57:50.371
We need some body work done.

57:50.413 --> 57:54.834
Need to pack up to 2,700 pounds
of cargo in these Minis

57:54.918 --> 57:56.211
with enough suspension
and horsepower

57:56.252 --> 57:58.296
to outrun anything chasing us.

57:58.379 --> 58:00.132
2,700 pounds of what?

58:00.216 --> 58:02.426
Of whatever.

58:04.553 --> 58:06.597
So, what do I get out
of this mystery deal, man?

58:06.680 --> 58:08.099
10,000.

58:10.101 --> 58:11.769
All right.

58:22.280 --> 58:24.241
What comes around...

58:37.838 --> 58:40.173
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

58:40.257 --> 58:42.135
We didn't get a chance
to meet yet.

58:42.176 --> 58:43.719
Wrench.

58:44.929 --> 58:46.681
Ham and cheese.

58:46.764 --> 58:48.433
Oh. Oh, that's cold.

58:48.474 --> 58:50.601
Damn, that's cold. Mmm.

58:53.604 --> 58:54.772
What comes around

58:56.816 --> 58:59.318
Just comes around

59:15.085 --> 59:16.003
What comes around

59:19.465 --> 59:20.340
What comes around...

59:36.065 --> 59:37.317
You want all greens?

59:37.400 --> 59:38.735
'Cause, ah, 'cause you got them.

59:39.819 --> 59:40.862
What have you got?

59:40.945 --> 59:43.282
Welcome to L.A. 's
Automated Traffic Surveillance

59:43.365 --> 59:45.451
and Control Operations Center.

59:45.534 --> 59:47.286
See, they use video feeds
from intersections

59:47.369 --> 59:48.579
and specifically designed
algorithms

59:48.662 --> 59:50.331
to predict traffic conditions,

59:50.372 --> 59:52.041
and thereby control
traffic lights, so

59:52.124 --> 59:54.043
all I did was come up
with my own

59:54.126 --> 59:56.504
kick-ass algorithm to sneak in,

59:56.587 --> 59:58.297
and now we own the place.

59:58.380 --> 59:59.340
You want to do a dry run?

59:59.381 --> 01:00:01.092
I thought you'd never ask.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:04.179
See, red light?

01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:05.222
Green light.

01:00:10.811 --> 01:00:11.812
- Danielson?
- Yeah?

01:00:11.895 --> 01:00:12.896
What's up with Grid 34?

01:00:12.979 --> 01:00:14.898
Let's check it out.

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.358
Hey, hey.

01:00:16.399 --> 01:00:18.235
Oh, oops, did I...?

01:00:18.318 --> 01:00:20.779
Oops, wow, but it's awesome.
Is that not awesome?

01:00:20.862 --> 01:00:22.739
- Can you change it back now?
- Yeah.

01:00:28.496 --> 01:00:29.414
Lights are working fine.

01:00:29.497 --> 01:00:31.791
Just an accident.

01:00:33.084 --> 01:00:34.085
That's good.

01:00:35.586 --> 01:00:37.296
What are those?

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.215
Unnecessary engine parts.

01:00:39.298 --> 01:00:43.010
I lost your smog controls,
and 200 pounds of body fat.

01:00:43.094 --> 01:00:45.931
You got yourself
a sweet ride now, Charlie.

01:00:46.014 --> 01:00:47.099
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

01:00:47.266 --> 01:00:48.350
And never getting lost

01:00:48.434 --> 01:00:49.893
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

01:00:49.935 --> 01:00:51.645
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

01:00:51.728 --> 01:00:53.647
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:54.940
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

01:00:55.023 --> 01:00:56.650
And never getting lost

01:00:56.733 --> 01:00:58.360
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

01:00:58.444 --> 01:01:00.571
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

01:01:00.612 --> 01:01:02.990
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

01:01:03.073 --> 01:01:05.618
Won't stop driving
till it's over

01:01:07.078 --> 01:01:11.791
Still be cruising
when the sun goes down

01:01:11.875 --> 01:01:14.294
Won't stop driving
till it's over

01:01:14.377 --> 01:01:16.087
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

01:01:16.129 --> 01:01:17.464
And never getting lost

01:01:17.547 --> 01:01:19.048
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

01:01:19.174 --> 01:01:21.593
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

01:01:21.634 --> 01:01:24.429
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor...

01:01:28.267 --> 01:01:31.103
You know what
I'm thinking about right now?

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.481
The look on Steve's face.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:45.367
You're early.

01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:47.078
I'm in a hurry.

01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:51.208
Of course, you know
that the Florida

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:53.460
vote rigging was a CIA
and mob operation.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:54.461
Is that so?

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:55.796
Yeah, which is not
so very different

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:57.047
from when your John F. Kennedy

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.800
won a rigged election
with the help of his father.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.426
You're uncomfortable
that I mentioned it.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:04.012
No, Yevhen, I don't like
making two trips.

01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:05.931
You Americans.

01:02:06.014 --> 01:02:07.683
You love your heroes.

01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:10.645
A holiday for Columbus?

01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:12.563
He makes the wrong turn,

01:02:12.647 --> 01:02:15.066
and wipes out an entire
indigenous people.

01:02:15.191 --> 01:02:16.359
And you know
what he was looking for?

01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:18.069
I bet you're going to tell me.

01:02:18.194 --> 01:02:19.237
Gold.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.072
Supposedly for Queen Isabella,

01:02:21.197 --> 01:02:22.949
but don't think that
the Medicis back in Italy

01:02:23.032 --> 01:02:24.492
didn't want a part
of that action.

01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:26.828
And what did Italy
need gold for?

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:31.208
For the long-distance
slave trade based in Venice.

01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:32.543
Venice...
that's where

01:02:32.626 --> 01:02:34.545
these bricks...

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.801
You were saying something?

01:02:40.884 --> 01:02:42.386
Nothing... No...

01:02:42.469 --> 01:02:43.595
No, you were really
on a roll there.

01:02:43.679 --> 01:02:45.013
Don't stop. I'm interested.

01:02:45.097 --> 01:02:47.015
Please, I'm confused,
my English...

01:02:49.394 --> 01:02:50.311
You understand fine.

01:02:50.395 --> 01:02:51.604
Now what do you know
about my gold?

01:02:51.688 --> 01:02:52.605
No, I don't...

01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:54.774
Don't you even think
about lying to me.

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:57.819
Okay,
okay, I, I heard a rumor

01:02:57.902 --> 01:03:00.405
about a heist in Venice.

01:03:00.488 --> 01:03:02.740
35 million in bricks,

01:03:02.824 --> 01:03:05.160
with an imprint
of a Balinese dancer on them.

01:03:05.243 --> 01:03:06.703
- Who have you told?
- No one.

01:03:06.786 --> 01:03:07.704
Who have you told?

01:03:07.787 --> 01:03:09.748
No one!
I swear to God!

01:03:11.751 --> 01:03:12.877
You swear to God?

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.379
You crazy?
I swear to God.

01:03:15.463 --> 01:03:16.422
I didn't!

01:03:17.965 --> 01:03:19.216
Well, then I guess
I believe you.

01:03:49.164 --> 01:03:50.583
Yevhen?

01:03:52.794 --> 01:03:54.295
Yevhen?

01:04:11.313 --> 01:04:12.481
Let's putt it this time...

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:15.818
Putt, not drive.

01:04:15.901 --> 01:04:17.194
Very good.

01:04:17.277 --> 01:04:18.529
If you can just get it,

01:04:18.612 --> 01:04:20.531
I know you can,
I know you can do it.

01:04:20.614 --> 01:04:21.865
Much better.

01:04:21.949 --> 01:04:23.951
I'm here to see Skinny Pete.

01:04:24.034 --> 01:04:25.285
Yeah, he's over there.

01:04:25.369 --> 01:04:26.912
Thanks, man.

01:04:29.456 --> 01:04:30.833
- Don't stare.
- Huh?

01:04:30.916 --> 01:04:31.960
Don't stare.

01:04:32.043 --> 01:04:33.378
He doesn't like
when people stare at him.

01:04:33.461 --> 01:04:34.420
Stare at what?

01:04:35.755 --> 01:04:37.006
That was good.
That was good.

01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:38.675
Try that one, I know
you're going to get that one.

01:04:39.968 --> 01:04:42.095
That was great.

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:43.847
- Skinny Pete.
- Yo, Charlie.

01:04:43.930 --> 01:04:45.098
What's up, man?

01:04:45.223 --> 01:04:46.474
How's it going?

01:04:46.558 --> 01:04:49.102
So was I right
about the gold bricks or what?

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:51.062
Oh, I'm not here to talk
about that. We need, uh...

01:04:51.146 --> 01:04:53.399
some supplies.

01:04:53.482 --> 01:04:54.400
Baby, go relax.

01:04:54.483 --> 01:04:55.401
Baby...

01:04:55.484 --> 01:04:56.819
Go relax.

01:05:02.825 --> 01:05:03.909
Yo.

01:05:03.993 --> 01:05:05.953
Yo.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:07.663
Supplies.

01:05:07.705 --> 01:05:08.539
What's wrong?

01:05:08.622 --> 01:05:09.707
Huh?

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:12.418
Uh... um, some, uh,

01:05:12.501 --> 01:05:13.628
some nitromin,

01:05:13.712 --> 01:05:15.338
uh...

01:05:15.422 --> 01:05:16.840
some, uh...

01:05:16.923 --> 01:05:19.176
some nitromin, primer...

01:05:19.217 --> 01:05:20.594
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

01:05:20.677 --> 01:05:21.052
Yo.

01:05:21.136 --> 01:05:22.220
Uh, nothing.

01:05:22.304 --> 01:05:23.221
I'm-I'm cool. I'm-I'm great.

01:05:23.305 --> 01:05:24.931
Uh, I just need some,
uh, big can of...

01:05:25.015 --> 01:05:26.933
Nitromin, primer,

01:05:27.017 --> 01:05:28.268
- Detonating cord...
- Right, right.

01:05:28.351 --> 01:05:30.395
...two triple-charged chemical
grenades and a launcher.

01:05:30.479 --> 01:05:33.231
Right, like I had, uh,
you know, told you... earlier.

01:05:33.316 --> 01:05:35.026
All right.

01:05:40.907 --> 01:05:42.617
Cost you about five G's.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.660
Done. Call me.

01:05:45.912 --> 01:05:47.371
Thanks, man.
I'm sorry about that.

01:05:47.455 --> 01:05:49.248
Uh-Uh, all right, man.

01:05:49.332 --> 01:05:51.125
- Peace.
- Come on.

01:06:08.769 --> 01:06:10.562
Get out.

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:12.397
There.

01:06:21.658 --> 01:06:23.409
Vance has something
to tell you.

01:06:26.788 --> 01:06:27.914
Go on.

01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:32.293
A couple weeks back...

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.549
I was working counter
at your cousin's shop.

01:06:36.632 --> 01:06:39.301
A guy come in asking
about gold bricks with Balinese

01:06:39.385 --> 01:06:41.178
dancer on them.

01:06:41.262 --> 01:06:42.680
What did you tell him?

01:06:44.557 --> 01:06:46.767
I told him
that I'd seen some bricks.

01:06:51.814 --> 01:06:53.858
I'm sorry.

01:06:55.151 --> 01:06:57.654
What did this man look like?

01:06:58.905 --> 01:06:59.865
He had, uh...

01:06:59.948 --> 01:07:01.283
long black hair,

01:07:01.366 --> 01:07:03.368
big tattoo on his neck.

01:07:05.787 --> 01:07:08.957
He must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.333
I know that guy.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:40.491
Baby, go relax.

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:53.212
Do you know who I am?

01:07:54.296 --> 01:07:55.756
You're Mashkov.

01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:57.716
That's right.

01:07:57.801 --> 01:08:00.428
You were asking
about gold bricks

01:08:00.512 --> 01:08:02.180
with a Balinese dancer
on them.

01:08:03.223 --> 01:08:04.682
Tell me why.

01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:13.358
Steve just called to confirm

01:08:13.399 --> 01:08:15.401
his 8:00 reservation
at the Water Grill.

01:08:15.443 --> 01:08:16.819
Okay, let's go over it
one more time.

01:08:16.903 --> 01:08:19.657
Gas the guards,
doors open 8:15.

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:21.700
Safe popped by 8:25.

01:08:21.742 --> 01:08:24.161
Loaded by 8:35,
out the door by 8:45.

01:08:24.245 --> 01:08:25.746
Straight to Union Station.

01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:27.163
Only green lights on your route.

01:08:27.247 --> 01:08:28.374
The rest of the city's red.

01:08:28.457 --> 01:08:30.042
Cops are stuck in the traffic,
like everyone else.

01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:31.167
Train leaves at 10:00.

01:08:31.252 --> 01:08:33.462
Cars have to be
on the carrier by 9:30.

01:08:33.546 --> 01:08:35.506
Timing's got to be dead on.

01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:36.881
Let's get ready.

01:08:36.924 --> 01:08:38.384
Let's get it.

01:09:09.375 --> 01:09:12.044
Wow, that is a nice car.

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:13.837
Sorry, Rob.

01:09:13.921 --> 01:09:15.089
Coast is clear, guys.

01:09:26.977 --> 01:09:27.935
This is it, guys.

01:09:27.978 --> 01:09:28.979
Moment of truth.

01:09:30.647 --> 01:09:31.774
What the hell is this?

01:09:34.109 --> 01:09:35.944
Shit!

01:09:36.028 --> 01:09:38.029
Steve's neighbor's
throwing a party.

01:09:41.451 --> 01:09:43.036
Are you here
for the, uh, Baker party, sir?

01:09:43.118 --> 01:09:44.912
No.

01:09:47.415 --> 01:09:49.334
We're not blowing
any gates tonight, guys.

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:51.085
Too many witnesses.

01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:52.212
Stella.

01:09:52.295 --> 01:09:54.964
I know, I know.

01:09:56.758 --> 01:09:58.635
I'm late for my date.

01:09:58.718 --> 01:10:01.387
Yeah, and you got to be
charming.

01:10:01.471 --> 01:10:03.098
You'll need him
to ask you out again.

01:10:03.182 --> 01:10:04.475
Sorry.

01:10:04.517 --> 01:10:07.144
Let's get out of the street.

01:10:11.023 --> 01:10:13.025
I really can't imagine
you doing that.

01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:14.819
What's that supposed to mean?

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.445
Well, you don't really seem

01:10:16.529 --> 01:10:20.282
like the adventurous type,
you know?

01:10:20.366 --> 01:10:23.662
Don't let the cable uniform,
you know, throw you.

01:10:23.703 --> 01:10:26.832
I wasn't making assumptions.

01:10:26.915 --> 01:10:28.333
I've made some
assumptions about you.

01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:31.086
Oh, really?

01:10:31.169 --> 01:10:32.212
And?

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:37.467
Well... you're just going
to have to wait and see.

01:10:43.432 --> 01:10:45.643
Why wait?
Let's get a check.

01:10:45.726 --> 01:10:46.894
Let's go back to my place.

01:10:46.978 --> 01:10:47.937
No assumptions...

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.522
Not tonight.
It's late.

01:10:49.605 --> 01:10:50.565
I should go home.

01:10:50.648 --> 01:10:53.651
What, you have
a cable company curfew?

01:10:53.734 --> 01:10:54.735
No,

01:10:54.777 --> 01:10:58.156
but I've made some
bad calls in the past.

01:10:58.239 --> 01:10:59.407
Hey.

01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:01.701
We should take this maybe a
little slower, you know?

01:11:01.742 --> 01:11:04.496
This lovely dinner,
sparkling conversation...

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:05.581
you still don't trust me?

01:11:05.664 --> 01:11:09.418
Oh, I trust everyone.

01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:12.796
It's the devil inside them
I don't trust.

01:11:17.259 --> 01:11:19.052
It's an interesting saying.

01:11:19.094 --> 01:11:20.471
It's charming.
Where'd you pick that up?

01:11:22.014 --> 01:11:22.931
Can't remember.

01:11:23.015 --> 01:11:24.517
Really?

01:11:24.601 --> 01:11:26.769
I knew a guy who said it
exactly like that.

01:11:26.853 --> 01:11:27.937
Really?

01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:30.398
Yeah. He's the only person
I've ever heard say that.

01:11:30.482 --> 01:11:32.484
He said it all the time.

01:11:32.567 --> 01:11:33.693
His name was John Bridger.

01:11:35.069 --> 01:11:37.405
You're hurting my wrist.

01:11:37.447 --> 01:11:39.824
He had a daughter
and she was about your age.

01:11:43.536 --> 01:11:45.998
Let go of my wrist.

01:11:46.081 --> 01:11:48.000
I knew that there was
something familiar about you.

01:11:48.083 --> 01:11:51.253
You're exactly like
your old man, you know that?

01:11:51.295 --> 01:11:53.964
I liked him, too,
right from the start.

01:11:54.048 --> 01:11:55.925
I liked him right up
until the minute I shot him.

01:11:58.636 --> 01:12:00.846
Who are you working with?

01:12:05.602 --> 01:12:07.270
She's with us.

01:12:19.032 --> 01:12:20.283
Gang's all here.

01:12:20.325 --> 01:12:23.120
You know, the only thing
worse than a thief, Bendel?

01:12:23.161 --> 01:12:24.746
A coward.

01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:25.831
Then you should have seen

01:12:25.914 --> 01:12:27.583
the way your daddy
begged for his life.

01:12:31.212 --> 01:12:32.213
It's not worth it.

01:12:32.296 --> 01:12:33.381
Put a leash on your cat.

01:12:39.011 --> 01:12:39.971
Hi, Steve.

01:12:40.054 --> 01:12:41.305
Charlie.

01:12:43.099 --> 01:12:44.976
Not bad, Charlie.

01:12:45.017 --> 01:12:46.018
Really, not bad.

01:12:46.102 --> 01:12:48.230
You have no idea
how hard it is for me

01:12:48.313 --> 01:12:50.023
not to reach across
this table and kill you

01:12:50.107 --> 01:12:51.483
with my bare hands.

01:12:51.525 --> 01:12:52.985
You know better than that,
Charlie.

01:12:53.068 --> 01:12:55.571
Can't let emotion
into these things.

01:12:55.654 --> 01:12:56.738
Tell me it wasn't about emotion

01:12:56.822 --> 01:12:58.490
when you shot John
and left us all for dead.

01:12:58.532 --> 01:13:00.284
That wasn't about emotion.

01:13:00.367 --> 01:13:02.578
It was about a lot of gold,
and I wanted it.

01:13:02.661 --> 01:13:04.496
Anything you think you
deserved, you didn't.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:07.082
Hey, don't talk about right
and wrong with me, man,

01:13:07.207 --> 01:13:08.751
'cause I just don't give a shit.

01:13:08.835 --> 01:13:10.295
Okay?

01:13:10.378 --> 01:13:13.006
You got your cards,
I got my cards,

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:15.550
we made our play,
and I came out on top, okay?

01:13:15.633 --> 01:13:17.343
Now if you want to start
the game up again,

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:19.179
that's fine with me.

01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:23.516
But what, I mean, what
is your play here, really?

01:13:23.558 --> 01:13:25.477
I mean, come on, what do you...
what do you think?

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:28.481
Y-you'll try to take out
my guards, right?

01:13:28.564 --> 01:13:31.484
I have five of them
that you don't know about.

01:13:31.567 --> 01:13:33.861
You'll try to have
Lyle hack the system.

01:13:33.903 --> 01:13:35.196
I'll change it again
tomorrow morning.

01:13:35.279 --> 01:13:38.115
What, what, what was
y-your final move?

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.034
I mean, you were going
to have Bridger's daughter

01:13:40.117 --> 01:13:42.077
come in and try
to crack my safe?

01:13:42.161 --> 01:13:45.498
I mean, that's...
that's very poetic and all,

01:13:45.581 --> 01:13:47.124
but I just don't see it.

01:13:47.208 --> 01:13:48.542
I don't think she'll get
anywhere near it.

01:13:48.626 --> 01:13:50.295
Same old Steve, huh?

01:13:50.378 --> 01:13:52.714
Always thinking defensively.

01:13:52.756 --> 01:13:54.466
That's why you're
always number two.

01:13:54.549 --> 01:13:56.593
How do you figure that?

01:13:56.676 --> 01:13:58.136
You got no imagination.

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.555
Couldn't even decide what
to do with all that money.

01:14:00.597 --> 01:14:02.641
You had to buy what
everybody else wanted.

01:14:02.724 --> 01:14:05.060
Oh... well, try this on
in your imagination, okay?

01:14:05.143 --> 01:14:06.228
That gold is already gone.

01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:07.979
That's bullshit, Steve.

01:14:08.063 --> 01:14:09.982
No, really, it's over Charlie.

01:14:10.066 --> 01:14:11.984
I'm trying to move
the last two bricks.

01:14:12.068 --> 01:14:14.654
You want to come after me
over a couple of lousy bricks?

01:14:14.737 --> 01:14:16.781
I mean, really, be my guest.

01:14:16.864 --> 01:14:18.574
But you're off to a bad start,
you know?

01:14:18.658 --> 01:14:19.784
'Cause you just blew
the best thing

01:14:19.867 --> 01:14:20.785
you had going for you.

01:14:20.868 --> 01:14:22.912
You just blew the element
of surprise.

01:14:26.874 --> 01:14:28.167
Surprised?

01:14:31.547 --> 01:14:32.589
It's over when I say it's over.

01:14:36.593 --> 01:14:38.595
Are you all right, sir?

01:15:10.462 --> 01:15:11.547
How you doing?

01:15:13.757 --> 01:15:16.510
Good...

01:15:16.594 --> 01:15:19.305
considering...

01:15:19.388 --> 01:15:21.765
considering the fact
that I'm doing all of this

01:15:21.849 --> 01:15:23.100
for a man I barely knew.

01:15:30.357 --> 01:15:35.447
You know what bothered me
all those years, Charlie?

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:38.950
It was that, whenever
he'd call me to tell me

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.994
that he was on some job,

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:44.623
I knew you were right there
with him.

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:50.462
You got to know him
a lot better than I did.

01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:54.342
Just 'cause he was around
me more doesn't mean

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.052
he wasn't thinking
about you all the time.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:58.513
Be nice if it was true.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:15:59.847
It is true.

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:01.808
He always regretted
not having been

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:03.851
a good enough father
to you, Stella.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:08.189
How do you know that?

01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:10.650
Because he told me.

01:16:17.324 --> 01:16:18.534
What did you do to your hand?

01:16:22.913 --> 01:16:23.872
I punched Steve.

01:16:23.956 --> 01:16:27.209
Why do you get to punch him
and I don't?

01:16:30.295 --> 01:16:31.672
Those hands are
way too valuable.

01:16:39.639 --> 01:16:41.015
Hey.

01:16:46.604 --> 01:16:48.481
Okay?

01:16:57.199 --> 01:16:58.826
There'll be nothing left
of that if you keep rubbing it.

01:17:05.332 --> 01:17:08.335
Tell Mr. Frazelli
we'll see him at 8:00.

01:17:08.419 --> 01:17:09.587
Charlie!

01:17:12.298 --> 01:17:13.340
He's flying the coop.

01:17:14.633 --> 01:17:15.802
When?

01:17:15.886 --> 01:17:17.345
His security guard called

01:17:17.429 --> 01:17:19.598
for a private helicopter
at 4:00 PM.

01:17:19.639 --> 01:17:22.267
There's an armored car service
coming to his house at 5:00.

01:17:22.309 --> 01:17:26.104
There is a cargo plane scheduled
to depart LAX at 8:00 PM

01:17:26.146 --> 01:17:27.105
to Mexico City.

01:17:27.147 --> 01:17:30.609
What if he's moving the safe
as a diversion?

01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:32.360
We crack it, it's empty,
the gold's somewhere else.

01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:34.488
Steve's not about to let
that gold out of his sight.

01:17:34.571 --> 01:17:35.697
It's going to be in that truck

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:36.991
and he's going to be watching it

01:17:37.074 --> 01:17:38.784
every step of the way
from the helicopter.

01:17:38.826 --> 01:17:40.578
So the gold's headed to Mexico.

01:17:40.661 --> 01:17:41.621
Who knows where?

01:17:41.662 --> 01:17:42.747
They could change
the flight plan in midair.

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:43.789
Slow down, slow down.

01:17:43.831 --> 01:17:44.707
You guys are looking at this
the wrong way.

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:45.791
This is good news for us.

01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:48.127
Charlie, what do you
mean, "good news"?

01:17:48.211 --> 01:17:50.004
We've been trying to get
to the gold in the safe,

01:17:50.087 --> 01:17:51.297
now the safe is coming to us.

01:17:51.339 --> 01:17:52.673
We're going to boost it
in transit.

01:17:52.757 --> 01:17:53.674
Charlie, it could take

01:17:53.758 --> 01:17:54.884
a dozen different routes
to the airport.

01:17:54.967 --> 01:17:56.637
We have no idea which one.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.972
We can't take out an armored
truck during rush hour.

01:17:59.014 --> 01:18:00.015
We're already set up to do it.

01:18:00.057 --> 01:18:01.475
Napster,

01:18:01.517 --> 01:18:05.562
gridlock every route
except for the one we choose.

01:18:05.646 --> 01:18:07.815
Force that truck to go
exactly where we want it to go.

01:18:07.898 --> 01:18:09.066
Where do we want it to go?

01:18:09.191 --> 01:18:11.693
We can't have a shoot-out
with armed guards. We'd lose.

01:18:11.777 --> 01:18:14.154
We do it like the Italian job.

01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:21.371
Hello?

01:18:21.454 --> 01:18:22.705
Why'd you do it?

01:18:22.789 --> 01:18:23.623
Do what?

01:18:23.706 --> 01:18:24.415
Yevhen.

01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:26.167
You didn't have to clip him.

01:18:26.251 --> 01:18:27.210
Whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

01:18:27.293 --> 01:18:28.211
We didn't clip anybody.

01:18:28.294 --> 01:18:29.295
Yevhen's cousin is under

01:18:29.379 --> 01:18:32.048
the distinct impression
that you did.

01:18:32.132 --> 01:18:33.174
Why does he think that?

01:18:33.258 --> 01:18:34.425
Because you want to know

01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:36.427
about the gold
with the Balinese dancer.

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:37.763
You told him that?

01:18:37.847 --> 01:18:39.098
Listen to me, man.

01:18:39.223 --> 01:18:41.016
If there's one thing that I know

01:18:41.058 --> 01:18:43.060
is never to mess
with Mother Nature,

01:18:43.102 --> 01:18:45.646
mother-in-laws
or mother-freakin' Ukrainians.

01:18:45.729 --> 01:18:49.316
Look, I need a favor.

01:19:15.343 --> 01:19:16.386
Yeah.

01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:17.554
Had a hiccup last night.

01:19:17.637 --> 01:19:18.555
Could use some help.

01:19:18.638 --> 01:19:19.724
Want hands-on this time.

01:19:19.807 --> 01:19:21.058
You interested?

01:19:21.142 --> 01:19:22.059
Could be.

01:19:22.143 --> 01:19:24.395
But I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

01:19:24.437 --> 01:19:26.814
If I'm in, I'm in.

01:19:26.898 --> 01:19:29.066
Okay, you're in.

01:19:29.108 --> 01:19:30.359
All right.

01:19:33.154 --> 01:19:34.572
What do you think, Charlie?

01:19:34.614 --> 01:19:35.615
This'll work.

01:19:35.698 --> 01:19:37.158
Let's go.

01:19:48.045 --> 01:19:49.421
You're amazing.

01:19:49.505 --> 01:19:50.923
It's a work of genius.

01:19:50.964 --> 01:19:51.924
Uh-huh.

01:20:00.683 --> 01:20:02.644
You okay?

01:20:02.727 --> 01:20:03.645
Just give me a moment.

01:20:03.728 --> 01:20:04.854
Now?

01:20:04.938 --> 01:20:08.107
I'm about to insert this pin
into this detonator tube,

01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:10.109
and if the brass touches
the sides,

01:20:10.276 --> 01:20:12.737
we'll both be the last people
we ever see.

01:20:15.615 --> 01:20:17.450
Take all the time you need.

01:20:20.495 --> 01:20:22.081
Hey, Charlie.

01:20:22.122 --> 01:20:25.125
What?

01:20:25.251 --> 01:20:28.629
I love you, man.

01:20:28.671 --> 01:20:30.965
I love you, too.

01:20:33.509 --> 01:20:36.637
Okay.
Okay.

01:20:47.023 --> 01:20:48.817
Your attention, please.

01:20:48.859 --> 01:20:50.694
Metrolink train number 774
will arrive

01:20:50.777 --> 01:20:52.529
in approximately 15 minutes.

01:21:09.505 --> 01:21:11.048
Check positions.

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:12.133
Napster?

01:21:12.216 --> 01:21:15.052
I'm in position.

01:21:15.136 --> 01:21:16.637
Handsome Rob?

01:21:16.721 --> 01:21:17.930
We're in position.

01:21:18.014 --> 01:21:20.016
Everything's quiet, Charlie.

01:21:23.103 --> 01:21:25.105
Wrench?

01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:26.857
Set.

01:21:43.081 --> 01:21:44.751
Charlie, we got
an uninvited visitor.

01:21:44.834 --> 01:21:47.504
Some motorcycle guard
following the truck.

01:21:47.587 --> 01:21:48.546
We'll deal with it.

01:21:54.928 --> 01:21:56.638
Who are these cats?

01:21:56.721 --> 01:21:57.764
What's wrong?

01:21:57.847 --> 01:21:59.808
Charlie, you won't believe this.

01:21:59.891 --> 01:22:01.935
He's brought in
three armored trucks.

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:05.564
It's a shell game.
Shell game now.

01:22:05.648 --> 01:22:07.399
Well, boss,
I can't reroute the truck

01:22:07.441 --> 01:22:09.276
if I don't know which truck
to reroute.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.111
Just go with the one
Steve follows in the helicopter.

01:22:11.237 --> 01:22:14.490
Remember, he said he'd never let
that gold out of his sight.

01:22:14.573 --> 01:22:16.617
Unless he's playing us,
and he is.

01:22:27.963 --> 01:22:29.631
Okay, let's go!

01:22:29.714 --> 01:22:31.716
Moving out!

01:22:44.354 --> 01:22:45.940
Here we go.

01:22:46.023 --> 01:22:47.650
They're pulling out.

01:22:47.733 --> 01:22:49.360
Napster,

01:22:49.443 --> 01:22:52.321
pull up the traffic cameras
you're watching.

01:22:52.405 --> 01:22:55.116
Where's the first camera
the trucks go past?

01:22:58.161 --> 01:23:00.872
Vine and Yucca; they're all
going to cross there.

01:23:00.955 --> 01:23:03.124
See which one's riding low.

01:23:14.094 --> 01:23:15.512
First one is...

01:23:18.015 --> 01:23:19.725
First two are the same, so...

01:23:23.937 --> 01:23:26.816
Houston, we have our truck.
It is number 128.

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:37.702
We're moving out.

01:23:39.204 --> 01:23:41.080
Three-kilo-bob
to two-fox-mike,

01:23:41.164 --> 01:23:42.373
we're heading to the airport.

01:23:56.972 --> 01:24:00.935
Okay, guys, truck 128
has turned right heading west.

01:24:01.018 --> 01:24:02.686
Gridlock time.

01:24:04.271 --> 01:24:07.900
Mr. Scott, pick up
a courtesy telephone please.

01:24:07.983 --> 01:24:09.861
Mr. Scott, pick up a courtesy...

01:24:11.863 --> 01:24:13.782
We've crashed.

01:24:15.575 --> 01:24:17.536
It's not a crash.

01:24:18.703 --> 01:24:20.080
We've got power.

01:24:21.164 --> 01:24:22.958
I can't log in.

01:24:23.041 --> 01:24:27.420
They are about to hit a major
detour and be sent your way.

01:24:34.345 --> 01:24:35.304
Oops.

01:24:39.809 --> 01:24:43.062
You'll... never... shut down...

01:24:43.145 --> 01:24:45.898
the real... Napster.

01:24:53.615 --> 01:24:54.992
What's your problem?!

01:25:01.331 --> 01:25:03.250
Truck 128,
what is your progress?

01:25:03.292 --> 01:25:05.085
This is truck 128.

01:25:05.127 --> 01:25:06.920
Traffic's out of control here.

01:25:06.962 --> 01:25:08.922
We've got to look
for another route.

01:25:08.964 --> 01:25:12.343
Check the police band.

01:25:12.427 --> 01:25:14.345
Okay, I'm opening up
a space on Highland.

01:25:18.683 --> 01:25:20.101
Oh, get us out of here.

01:25:20.143 --> 01:25:21.227
I'm trying.

01:25:26.107 --> 01:25:28.276
And he's taking it.

01:25:33.908 --> 01:25:35.618
Police scanners are saying
computers are down

01:25:35.701 --> 01:25:36.702
at Traffic Control Center.

01:25:36.785 --> 01:25:39.830
Nice, Charlie.

01:25:39.914 --> 01:25:42.124
What are you up to?

01:25:42.208 --> 01:25:44.460
Go back.

01:25:52.594 --> 01:25:54.888
I now command you to turn left.

01:25:56.848 --> 01:25:58.350
Come on, take the left.

01:26:00.519 --> 01:26:01.853
Yeah, you did.

01:26:01.937 --> 01:26:03.480
You did.

01:26:38.058 --> 01:26:39.351
Give us the flag.

01:26:39.434 --> 01:26:41.436
Metro just passed through
the station.

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.522
You are clear for 90 seconds.

01:26:43.605 --> 01:26:44.731
Go.

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:01.583
Come on, Steve.

01:27:18.601 --> 01:27:19.476
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:27:23.731 --> 01:27:26.400
Look out!
Look out!

01:27:26.483 --> 01:27:27.443
30 seconds and counting.

01:27:35.035 --> 01:27:36.369
15 seconds,
you're either blocked in

01:27:36.453 --> 01:27:37.579
or you're paint on the train.

01:27:43.543 --> 01:27:44.503
Go, go, come on, come on!

01:27:45.754 --> 01:27:47.297
Stay right on me,
this is gonna be tight.

01:27:54.346 --> 01:27:55.765
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:27:55.848 --> 01:27:57.767
You're gonna stop right there.

01:28:36.181 --> 01:28:37.642
Okay, guys.

01:28:37.725 --> 01:28:39.143
Coming into position.

01:28:39.227 --> 01:28:40.520
Stay cool.

01:28:52.574 --> 01:28:53.908
Ten...

01:28:53.992 --> 01:28:56.035
nine...

01:28:56.119 --> 01:28:57.830
eight...

01:28:57.913 --> 01:28:59.665
seven...

01:28:59.707 --> 01:29:01.041
six...

01:29:01.125 --> 01:29:02.751
five...

01:29:02.835 --> 01:29:04.503
four...

01:29:04.587 --> 01:29:05.337
Don't lose 'em,
don't lose 'em,

01:29:05.421 --> 01:29:06.839
- Don't lose them.
- Three...

01:29:06.922 --> 01:29:08.841
two...

01:29:08.924 --> 01:29:10.593
one.

01:29:32.199 --> 01:29:33.783
Damn.

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.584
Where's my truck?

01:29:41.667 --> 01:29:44.170
What...? What the fuck
happened to my truck?!

01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:50.551
It just blew right through
the street.

01:29:50.593 --> 01:29:52.053
Well, get under there.

01:30:02.773 --> 01:30:05.484
We have another problem, guys.

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:06.360
What?

01:30:07.486 --> 01:30:09.321
This isn't the Worthington 1000.

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:10.239
What?

01:30:11.573 --> 01:30:13.158
He switched safes on us.

01:30:14.618 --> 01:30:15.827
Can you do it?

01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:17.246
It's Israeli made.

01:30:17.329 --> 01:30:18.956
It's got a glass re-lock system.

01:30:19.039 --> 01:30:21.167
There's a pane of glass
right here behind this door.

01:30:21.251 --> 01:30:22.961
And if I don't drill perfectly
through that hole,

01:30:23.044 --> 01:30:24.921
steel rods snap into place

01:30:24.963 --> 01:30:26.130
and you can't open the safe.

01:30:26.214 --> 01:30:27.924
And then we're up shit creek.

01:30:57.246 --> 01:31:00.749
I think I just
cracked the glass.

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.837
I don't think it broke though.

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.715
I can't drill it again.

01:31:06.798 --> 01:31:09.301
I have to do it by touch.

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:12.888
I can't get through.

01:31:12.971 --> 01:31:14.472
The train's blocking the tunnel.

01:31:14.556 --> 01:31:16.433
Where does the Metro rail
come above ground?

01:31:16.474 --> 01:31:17.475
11th and Fig.

01:31:17.517 --> 01:31:19.144
Positions two and three,

01:31:19.227 --> 01:31:21.021
meet at 11th and Figueroa
and double back

01:31:21.104 --> 01:31:22.148
to Hollywood and Highland.

01:31:22.231 --> 01:31:23.816
Hurry up!

01:31:38.539 --> 01:31:40.500
Your attention please.

01:31:40.583 --> 01:31:42.586
Baggage for train number 22

01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:44.880
is now available
at carousel number four.

01:31:44.963 --> 01:31:47.841
Baggage for train number 22
is now available

01:31:47.925 --> 01:31:49.676
at carousel number four.

01:32:23.086 --> 01:32:25.047
I can't do this, Charlie.

01:32:25.089 --> 01:32:26.048
Stella...

01:32:26.090 --> 01:32:27.174
I can't do it...
I need a drill,

01:32:27.299 --> 01:32:28.467
a borescope, something.

01:32:28.551 --> 01:32:29.885
- I need to...
- You don't need any of that.

01:32:29.969 --> 01:32:31.303
Come on, Charlie.

01:32:31.387 --> 01:32:33.556
Hey, you can do this.

01:33:28.655 --> 01:33:29.865
Slide.

01:33:29.948 --> 01:33:31.241
Come on, come on.

01:33:37.789 --> 01:33:39.291
Hey.

01:33:39.374 --> 01:33:42.544
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

01:33:42.628 --> 01:33:43.712
Absolutely.

01:33:47.008 --> 01:33:48.510
Napster.

01:33:48.593 --> 01:33:49.511
Yeah?

01:33:49.594 --> 01:33:51.596
13 across, four high, four deep.

01:33:53.264 --> 01:33:55.683
That's, uh, 208 bricks.

01:33:55.767 --> 01:33:56.935
How much?

01:33:56.976 --> 01:33:59.354
Oh. Uh, 208 times...

01:34:02.815 --> 01:34:04.317
2.7... 2.7 million.

01:34:04.359 --> 01:34:05.109
What?

01:34:06.152 --> 01:34:07.279
No, it's 27.

01:34:07.363 --> 01:34:08.739
That's 27 million.

01:34:08.822 --> 01:34:10.741
That's $27 million
worth of gold.

01:34:15.079 --> 01:34:18.123
Yeah!

01:34:18.165 --> 01:34:22.086
Got the... holy spirit.

01:34:22.169 --> 01:34:24.588
You should get on it.
It's a good train.

01:35:01.878 --> 01:35:03.337
What did you think, John?

01:35:11.471 --> 01:35:13.015
27 million.

01:35:13.056 --> 01:35:14.516
Say it again.

01:35:14.558 --> 01:35:16.894
- 27 million.
- Say it again.

01:35:16.935 --> 01:35:18.896
- Say it again!
- 27 million.

01:35:18.937 --> 01:35:20.105
Say it again!

01:35:43.630 --> 01:35:45.340
Two motorcycles on us, Charlie.

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:50.346
I've got three Minis
in the storm drain

01:35:50.429 --> 01:35:51.972
heading east towards
the L.A. River.

01:35:52.056 --> 01:35:53.641
Stop them before they get
to the street.

01:35:58.646 --> 01:35:59.688
Shit!

01:36:03.943 --> 01:36:04.568
Whoa!

01:36:18.833 --> 01:36:19.709
Here we go.

01:36:28.969 --> 01:36:29.594
Whoo!

01:36:31.681 --> 01:36:32.223
Whoa! Whoa!

01:36:34.976 --> 01:36:35.560
Open your door.

01:36:40.898 --> 01:36:42.984
Come on, guys, we're moving.

01:36:48.197 --> 01:36:49.657
There, there, there, there,
there, there.

01:36:59.334 --> 01:37:01.962
Hey, come on, come on, look out.

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.867
Come on!

01:37:37.666 --> 01:37:39.877
Where you going?
Where you going?

01:37:59.314 --> 01:38:00.190
I'm going to take Steve.

01:38:00.232 --> 01:38:01.358
You guys go straight
to Union Station.

01:38:01.399 --> 01:38:02.609
I'll meet you there.

01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:05.403
Stay on him.
Stay on him!

01:38:13.870 --> 01:38:15.957
Okay, Charlie, I'm opening up
a spot on lower Grand.

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:21.128
I know it's you, Charlie.

01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:24.131
Take your next left.

01:39:23.861 --> 01:39:25.154
Nice move, Steve.

01:40:03.569 --> 01:40:04.654
Get out!

01:40:04.695 --> 01:40:06.531
- Get out!
- Okay.

01:40:06.614 --> 01:40:08.157
I said get out!

01:41:42.965 --> 01:41:43.925
They got a bunch of cars

01:41:43.966 --> 01:41:45.593
in there, right?
Mini Coopers?

01:41:45.635 --> 01:41:47.637
Look, look, man...

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.139
- I don't know anything...
- Hey, don't worry about them.

01:41:50.181 --> 01:41:52.600
I'll give you five grand
you put me inside that car.

01:41:57.104 --> 01:41:59.482
Buy your girlfriend
something nice.

01:42:04.112 --> 01:42:05.781
Come on.

01:42:11.537 --> 01:42:13.622
Half now, half when
you help me unload.

01:42:18.544 --> 01:42:20.671
I've got to hand it
to you, Steve.

01:42:20.754 --> 01:42:24.008
You actually played this one
pretty smart.

01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:26.678
Decoy trucks...
you switched safes.

01:42:26.761 --> 01:42:27.971
The helicopter routine,

01:42:28.012 --> 01:42:29.806
I mean, that was
pretty damn good.

01:42:29.847 --> 01:42:33.476
But now I've got the gold...
and you, you've got nothing.

01:42:33.518 --> 01:42:34.310
I got this.

01:42:34.352 --> 01:42:35.562
So cut the crap,

01:42:35.645 --> 01:42:37.355
and give me my goddamn gold!

01:42:51.412 --> 01:42:53.372
Who the hell are you?

01:42:53.414 --> 01:42:55.207
I am Mashkov...

01:42:55.332 --> 01:42:57.209
and you killed my cousin Yevhen.

01:42:57.334 --> 01:42:59.253
Got to have some insurance,
Steve.

01:43:08.722 --> 01:43:10.390
Yevhen was already dead
when I got there.

01:43:10.473 --> 01:43:12.517
I'm sorry about that,
but Yevhen dealt with

01:43:12.559 --> 01:43:13.727
a lot of unsavory people.

01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:15.478
Now, this guy's
trying to play you.

01:43:15.562 --> 01:43:17.522
You are right...

01:43:17.606 --> 01:43:19.566
no imagination.

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.904
There's a lot of gold in there.

01:43:23.987 --> 01:43:25.531
We're the only ones with guns.

01:43:25.573 --> 01:43:26.991
I'll make you a good deal.

01:43:35.082 --> 01:43:36.918
I've already made my deal.

01:43:42.256 --> 01:43:43.591
What do you want?

01:43:43.674 --> 01:43:45.928
You know this was
never about the gold.

01:43:46.011 --> 01:43:48.180
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, sweetheart.

01:43:52.601 --> 01:43:54.228
Bitch!

01:43:54.311 --> 01:43:56.021
Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

01:43:57.606 --> 01:43:58.732
Okay.

01:44:02.194 --> 01:44:03.445
Wait a minute
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:44:03.528 --> 01:44:05.113
Wait a minute. I'll double
whatever he's giving you.

01:44:05.197 --> 01:44:06.115
Just don't shoot me.

01:44:06.199 --> 01:44:08.368
Don't worry, I'm not
going to shoot you.

01:44:08.451 --> 01:44:11.412
No, I'm going to take you
to my workplace.

01:44:11.496 --> 01:44:13.331
I think you would be
very interested

01:44:13.414 --> 01:44:14.999
in some of the machinery I use.

01:44:17.919 --> 01:44:18.878
No, come on.

01:44:24.467 --> 01:44:25.510
Guys.

01:44:25.593 --> 01:44:27.721
I want to make a toast.

01:44:27.805 --> 01:44:29.181
To John Bridger,

01:44:29.265 --> 01:44:31.934
the most brilliant
master planner of all.

01:44:31.976 --> 01:44:33.936
Father and friend.

01:44:33.978 --> 01:44:35.020
To my dad.

01:44:39.984 --> 01:44:41.193
Stella was right.

01:44:41.277 --> 01:44:42.736
It wasn't about the money.

01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:44.280
Of course that
didn't stop the guys

01:44:44.363 --> 01:44:45.698
from having a little bit of fun.

01:44:45.781 --> 01:44:47.701
Money!

01:44:47.784 --> 01:44:50.203
Handsome Rob
got his Aston Martin.

01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:54.749
Get a good job with good pay...

01:44:54.833 --> 01:44:57.043
He took it
for a ride to break it in.

01:44:59.296 --> 01:45:05.677
Money, it's a gas

01:45:05.719 --> 01:45:10.933
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

01:45:11.017 --> 01:45:12.476
He got off with a warning.

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:16.147
New car, caviar,
four star daydream

01:45:16.230 --> 01:45:18.816
Left Ear got his dream house
in the south of Spain

01:45:18.858 --> 01:45:21.861
with a room just for his shoes.

01:45:21.903 --> 01:45:22.987
Buenos dias.

01:45:23.029 --> 01:45:26.157
Buenos dias.

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.370
Money, get back

01:45:30.454 --> 01:45:32.873
Lyle finally made the cover
of Wired Magazine.

01:45:32.915 --> 01:45:37.377
I'm all right, Jack, keep
your hands off of my stack

01:45:37.461 --> 01:45:38.545
Are you really the Napster?

01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:40.005
Money!

01:45:40.047 --> 01:45:41.173
Yes, I am.

01:45:41.256 --> 01:45:43.217
And he got that
kick-ass stereo he wanted.

01:45:43.342 --> 01:45:47.387
Uh, would you listen
to something for me?

01:45:47.471 --> 01:45:48.597
With speakers so loud

01:45:48.681 --> 01:45:50.892
they'd blow
a woman's clothes off.

01:45:50.934 --> 01:45:54.395
I'm in the high-fidelity...

01:45:54.479 --> 01:45:55.605
If you would.

01:45:55.688 --> 01:45:57.190
...first class traveling set

01:45:57.273 --> 01:46:02.695
And I think I need a Lear jet

01:46:11.413 --> 01:46:13.165
And me?

01:46:13.249 --> 01:46:16.168
I took John Bridger's advice.

01:46:16.252 --> 01:46:19.505
I found somebody I want to spend
the rest of my life with

01:46:19.588 --> 01:46:21.173
