00:45.670 --> 00:49.090
<i>Dr. Bender, paging Dr. Bender, please.</i>

00:49.170 --> 00:51.670
<i>Dr. Bender, paging Dr. Bender, please.</i>

01:13.900 --> 01:17.570
He's OK, Grace.
Everything went really well.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.370
They just moved him out of recovery

01:20.450 --> 01:24.370
- and he's in his room.
- Oh, thank God.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.870
-I've been praying for him.
-Me too.

01:26.960 --> 01:30.290
What's happening?

01:30.380 --> 01:32.130
Is there news?

01:32.210 --> 01:35.800
Your dad made it through surgery
with flying colors.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.220
He's going to be just fine.

01:37.300 --> 01:41.260
That's so good!

01:42.100 --> 01:44.350
-Ah... Let me just--
-Sorry... Yeah.

01:44.430 --> 01:46.890
-Wow.
-I was still asleep.

01:46.980 --> 01:48.730
That was special.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.230
He looks so small in that bed.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.320
I can almost see what he looked like
when he was a boy.

01:59.450 --> 02:02.280
When he wakes up should I tell him
Frankie and I had intercourse?

02:02.370 --> 02:03.910
-No! No!
-Are you crazy?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.210
OK. That was my instinct.
Just checking.

02:07.710 --> 02:11.380
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm looking
for Mr. Hanson's spouse?

02:11.460 --> 02:14.630
Well, I guess that would be me.
I am the spouse.

02:14.710 --> 02:17.630
Well, don't get too excited.
I'm from the billing department.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.090
Oh.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.810
I love you so much.

02:38.740 --> 02:42.280
Wow. They really are married, aren't they?

02:42.370 --> 02:44.790
They really are.

02:44.870 --> 02:47.160
I need gluten.

02:58.340 --> 03:00.380
Oh. My powers are weak.

03:00.470 --> 03:02.050
Your powers are fictional.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.300
Oh, God.

03:04.390 --> 03:06.430
We don't look a day over 350.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.270
I would've loved being born
in the 17th century.

03:09.350 --> 03:11.270
Of course I would have died in my 30s.

03:11.350 --> 03:13.980
-I look like our mailman.
-Let's go.

03:14.730 --> 03:17.320
Hey, kids,
I feel my trademark energy waning,

03:17.400 --> 03:19.650
and I could really use
a bowl of Grape-Nuts.

03:19.740 --> 03:23.320
So unless one of you has some,
I-- I'm just gonna skedaddle.

03:23.410 --> 03:24.410
-OK.
-Bye, Frankie.

03:24.490 --> 03:26.330
- Bye, Momma.
- Bye, Mom.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.410
-Don't ask.
-What's wrong?

03:31.420 --> 03:34.840
Our insurance is balking
at the bill, plus, I just remembered

03:34.920 --> 03:38.300
there are 80 people
coming to our house in 48 hours

03:38.380 --> 03:42.300
for a wedding that's already happened.
Not to mention the caterer, the florist--

03:42.380 --> 03:43.800
Yeah, what about the bagpiper?

03:43.890 --> 03:45.720
- Did he make you get the bagpiper?
- Two!

03:45.810 --> 03:50.140
Identical twin, red-headed piper brothers.
Fergus and Finn.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.190
Hot.

03:51.270 --> 03:52.980
Sol, we'll can take care of it.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.480
Right guys? We'll just--
We'll call everyone and cancel everything.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.690
-It's fine.
-Really?

03:56.770 --> 03:59.230
I hate to be helpful,
but I could use the distraction

03:59.320 --> 04:00.650
while we're waiting for Dad to wake up.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.240
Dad, don't stress. We got it.
Take this off your worry list.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.740
-It's time for a full-body exhale.
-Uh-oh.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.620
-Full-body exhale. Here we go.
-Excuse us.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.710
Inhale.

04:11.790 --> 04:13.960
Exhale.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.380
Drop it!
Release my Cheez-Its!

04:18.459 --> 04:21.300
Aw, man, she really does
need her full 11 hours.

04:21.380 --> 04:23.220
OK, I got to go home,
check on the house,

04:23.300 --> 04:24.720
get a change of clothes. Wait!

04:25.550 --> 04:29.180
I need to fix this insurance stuff
before Robert wakes up.

04:29.260 --> 04:31.390
And get a change of clothes.
Did I say that?

04:31.480 --> 04:33.980
OK, this is what we're gonna do.

04:34.060 --> 04:36.060
We're gonna go to your house
so you can stay here

04:36.150 --> 04:38.610
-and take care of everything else.
-I couldn't ask you to do that.

04:38.690 --> 04:39.900
Well, you didn't. I offered.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.650
Text me a list of what you need
and I'll bring it back for you.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.320
Oh, thank you so much.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.410
You're welcome.

04:45.490 --> 04:46.780
Insurance.

04:47.660 --> 04:48.780
Let me hold that.

04:48.870 --> 04:50.660
-Bye, Mom.
-Oh. Hey, guys.

04:50.740 --> 04:52.960
Somebody should be here
if Robert wakes up.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.830
-Coyote, will-will you stay?
-Of course.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.380
I love to watch guys sleep.

05:00.340 --> 05:01.880
Speaking of sleep, I like sleep.

05:01.960 --> 05:05.260
I prefer it to running errands
for my ex-husband.

05:05.340 --> 05:07.180
Why are we doing this for him?

05:07.260 --> 05:09.430
Because, Frankie. It's what one does.

05:09.510 --> 05:13.680
It's not what I does.
I've been here for 48 fucking hours--

05:13.770 --> 05:17.730
Whatever, Mary Lou.
Why don't you work at McDonald's?

05:18.650 --> 05:20.730
-Whoa.
-Yeah, I know stuff.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.530
No, you don't.

05:23.610 --> 05:26.280
-Yes, I do.
-Mommy, look! Free crackers!

05:26.360 --> 05:28.700
Nothing's free.

05:28.780 --> 05:30.740
You-- Frankie!

05:36.370 --> 05:37.710
Whoa.

05:37.790 --> 05:42.000
This is a lot more loot
than Sol and I got for our wedding.

05:42.090 --> 05:45.170
Mighta had something to do with the
50 other couples you were married with.

05:45.260 --> 05:48.680
Oh, man, they got a Vitamix?

05:48.760 --> 05:50.470
I always wanted one of those.

05:50.550 --> 05:51.930
They get everything, don't they?

05:52.010 --> 05:55.180
Maybe Sol will trip over it
when he comes back.

05:55.270 --> 05:58.230
Actually, will you help me move
some of these things out of the way?

05:58.310 --> 06:00.940
Oh, whatever, Mary Lou.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.690
Why don't you... Lou.

06:04.780 --> 06:06.650
Why don't you go to McDonald's
and get me--

06:06.740 --> 06:09.360
-Forget it. You'll never learn it.
-Everybody a burger.

06:09.450 --> 06:11.870
Hello.

06:11.950 --> 06:13.490
Oh! No solicitors.

06:13.620 --> 06:15.410
No, no, I-I live across the street,

06:15.500 --> 06:18.460
and I saw an ambulance here
a couple of days ago.

06:18.540 --> 06:21.880
-Are you Gladys Kravitz?
-No, I'm Lucy.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.960
Oh, Grace! Grace!

06:24.050 --> 06:25.590
She knows me. Grace.

06:25.670 --> 06:28.510
-Lucy. Hello.
-Hello.

06:28.590 --> 06:31.470
Listen, what's going on?
I've been very worried.

06:31.550 --> 06:33.220
Robert had a heart attack,
but he's all right.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.600
-Ah! He's all right?
-Yeah, he's fine.

06:35.680 --> 06:36.810
Oh, well, I'm so relieved.

06:36.890 --> 06:39.650
We're all relieved.
Thanks for stopping by, Luce.

06:39.730 --> 06:42.690
Yeah, you're welcome.
It's just so crazy.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.150
I mean-- Oh, those are from us.

06:45.230 --> 06:49.530
Ken and I were just here for dinner
with the boys and Robert looked just fine.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.280
-You, you had dinner with them?
-Well, it was their turn to host.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.490
And let me say that Robert
makes a mean mojito.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.080
-Robert?
-Well, you know,

06:57.160 --> 07:01.000
Ken and I have always
wanted to get to know you, too.

07:01.080 --> 07:04.170
But, you know, you were busy
with the kids and work,

07:04.250 --> 07:05.800
and rushing out of the car
to your house,

07:05.880 --> 07:08.130
and rushing from the house to the car.
So...

07:08.220 --> 07:11.470
How do you catch a moonbeam in your hand?

07:11.550 --> 07:14.220
Poor Sol. He must be worried sick.

07:14.310 --> 07:16.220
He is so wonderful.

07:16.310 --> 07:19.100
-Do you know Sol?
-Clearly I-I know nothing.

07:19.190 --> 07:22.060
Well, I hope that you
get to meet him some day.

07:22.150 --> 07:26.480
Sol has the soul of the Buddha,
he has the heart of Mother Teresa.

07:26.570 --> 07:29.150
And, oh, those soulful eyes!

07:29.240 --> 07:30.990
How they twinkle when you know he's--

07:31.070 --> 07:34.830
You know, since you love Sol so much,
maybe you could take him his underwear.

07:34.910 --> 07:35.870
Oh, Frankie.

07:35.950 --> 07:38.250
-Well, I suppose I could.
-No. We're OK.

07:38.330 --> 07:39.910
-Thank you for stopping by, Lucy.
-OK. All right.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.790
-Well, you know, I'm available.
-We'll give him your regard.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.750
No. You give him a hug.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.670
Oh, my God.
Let's do this and get out of here.

07:58.470 --> 08:03.020
-What?
-I don't know. It's just... different.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.770
You want to leave?

08:06.020 --> 08:09.070
What is that coffee table
doing floating out in space?

08:09.150 --> 08:11.360
And this chair?

08:11.450 --> 08:15.120
Looks like it dropped out
of a wormhole from the Tang Dynasty.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.910
Everything is just wrong.

08:17.950 --> 08:20.160
And what's with the ottoman
that looks like a yeti?

08:20.250 --> 08:23.330
-That's Sol's, right?
-Yeah. He loves that thing.

08:23.420 --> 08:27.840
Well, it belongs by the window,
or... out the window, actually.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.799
Did you know I even sewed a stupid pocket
on it for his stupid reading glasses?

08:32.880 --> 08:37.720
Which he never used because they were
always under a stupid couch cushion.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.350
Sol did not put
these glasses on his list

08:40.429 --> 08:43.940
because he thinks he has his extras,
which he doesn't,

08:44.020 --> 08:47.270
because they are always
under his favorite pillow.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.280
Ha-ha. Ta-da!

08:49.360 --> 08:53.070
It's like a circus trick that
not many people would be interested in.

08:53.150 --> 08:56.280
Including me. Let's get out of here.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.080
No, you stay down here.
I'm gonna do the upstairs stuff.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.370
-Oh, brother.
-There's a brown sweater,

09:01.450 --> 09:03.250
Xanax, mouth guard.

09:03.330 --> 09:06.920
-God, I hope there's a case on that.
-Well, the Xanax will not be upstairs

09:07.000 --> 09:08.750
because he keeps that
with all his other drugs,

09:08.840 --> 09:10.500
which are with the spices
in the kitchen.

09:11.760 --> 09:16.680
Well, that makes about as much sense
as a sarape on a velvet couch.

09:16.760 --> 09:20.390
And the brown sweater
is in a cedar box he keeps in the closet

09:20.470 --> 09:24.770
so that it will smell like the cabin
where he first read <i> Catcher in the Rye.</i>

09:24.850 --> 09:29.560
-You're kidding.
-Damn it, knowledge, leave my head!

09:30.690 --> 09:33.320
We can't get the deposits,
but we can try to get some money back.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.990
We should play up the heart attack.

09:35.070 --> 09:37.780
Say the surgeon had to go back in
because they left a Coke can inside.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.530
-Over the top.
-Shot glass. Dice.

09:40.620 --> 09:43.000
-Bow tie?
-Is the surgeon a riverboat gambler?

09:43.080 --> 09:45.500
Look, I'll call the vendors,
you guys divide the guest list.

09:45.580 --> 09:47.080
Wouldn't it be better if you took the list

09:47.170 --> 09:48.790
since all of these people
like you better than me?

09:48.880 --> 09:51.960
Exactly. The guests will be so eager
to get off the phone with you

09:52.050 --> 09:53.710
that it'll all go by more quickly.

09:54.800 --> 09:58.550
A brutal yet fair point.
You're smarter than I give you credit for.

09:58.640 --> 10:02.140
Though I do wonder how Princess Goody
Two-Tits is gonna get one single penny

10:02.220 --> 10:04.980
from the big, bad potentially
mob-affiliated vendors.

10:05.060 --> 10:07.520
Wuh-whoa. Big sister throw-down.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.610
The same way I beat you out
for Commissioner of Youth Activities

10:10.690 --> 10:13.150
by using my sweet demeanor
and sugar cookies to get elected

10:13.230 --> 10:16.530
while you used intimidation
and then promised to blow everyone.

10:16.610 --> 10:19.110
-Game on.
-I didn't do it.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.700
There wasn't enough time before voting.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.470
Hey.

10:39.050 --> 10:40.640
Did you read my play?

10:43.760 --> 10:45.270
Did you give me a play?

10:46.180 --> 10:47.480
You didn't read it yet?

10:48.480 --> 10:50.100
Um...

10:52.650 --> 10:55.150
Well, what was your play about?

11:12.880 --> 11:15.960
Oh... So cute.

11:23.890 --> 11:25.850
Oh...

11:27.930 --> 11:29.230
Ee! Cold.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.940
Oh...

11:35.980 --> 11:38.030
Little baby spoons.

11:38.110 --> 11:39.490
What are you doing?

11:39.570 --> 11:43.780
-What does it look like I'm doing?
-Stealing from our ex-husbands.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.080
-Are you going to tell?
-No.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.950
Take a spoon so I know you're cool.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.120
I'm not telling them,
because you're not doing it,

11:51.210 --> 11:52.870
because it's not something one does.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.960
Come on!

11:54.040 --> 11:57.750
They're getting all this new stuff
for their wedding and we get nothing.

12:02.010 --> 12:03.550
I thought you wanted to go home.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.470
I do. Don't I deserve some kind of
compensation for my services?

12:07.560 --> 12:11.230
I usually get paid 300 bucks
for marrying people. Plus a tip.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.860
-Give that to me.
-No, no. It makes me so happy.

12:16.940 --> 12:18.530
-I don't care. Give it to me.
-Give it.

12:18.610 --> 12:19.730
-Frankie, give it to me!
-Give it!

12:19.820 --> 12:22.780
Is that the hospital?

12:24.030 --> 12:25.740
Sol wants his earplugs.

12:25.820 --> 12:28.790
Which he keeps by the fishbowl
so he'll be reminded to feed the fish

12:28.870 --> 12:29.950
before going to sleep.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.080
Fine. I'll get them.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.790
Wait. Up against the wall.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.090
You seem to be enjoying yourself.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.260
-Really?
-I miss you already.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.600
So the money you say we owe
is for a special surgeon,

12:49.680 --> 12:52.600
our surgeon called in
during my husband's surgery

12:52.690 --> 12:55.600
-who's not in our network?
-That is correct.

12:55.690 --> 12:58.440
Whom we didn't know about and never met.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.030
That is correct.

13:00.110 --> 13:03.030
But had we known about this surgeon,

13:03.110 --> 13:05.360
in the time it would have taken
to be janked around

13:05.450 --> 13:10.290
and rejected by insurance,
my husband would have died on the table!

13:11.290 --> 13:13.830
But then you wouldn't owe $35,000.

13:13.910 --> 13:15.870
Look, my husband had a heart attack.

13:15.960 --> 13:19.000
If he sees this bill he's going to
have another, which can't happen,

13:19.090 --> 13:21.670
because he's got to get healthy
because there's some stuff

13:21.760 --> 13:24.220
I need to process with him--
that I can't talk about--

13:24.300 --> 13:27.470
but let's just say some shit
is going down!

13:29.930 --> 13:32.770
What if we refuse to pay?

13:32.850 --> 13:34.770
Interesting question.

13:34.890 --> 13:37.520
No one's ever been clever enough
to try that before.

13:40.150 --> 13:43.820
Actually, the hospital will sue you
and come after your wages.

13:44.860 --> 13:46.280
Who's next?

13:51.620 --> 13:53.660
That's right, no wedding. Yeah.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.750
Don't come. Buh-bye.

13:55.830 --> 13:58.040
No, you have a great day, Spencer.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.290
And can I just say
what a pleasure it has been

14:00.380 --> 14:02.500
to work with such
an absolute professional.

14:02.590 --> 14:04.840
I'm gonna give you a five star Yelp review
right this second.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.760
OK, you too. Buh-bye. Ha.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.970
A very respectable 40 percent refund
from the florist.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.600
New friend made. Flies, honey.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.810
Oh, right, your mother had the same thing.

14:13.890 --> 14:17.390
Except with clots. That must have been
very upsetting for you, Mrs. Mathison.

14:17.480 --> 14:20.110
I just did five calls in line for coffee,
how many have you done?

14:20.190 --> 14:22.780
This is the first.
She's having a lot of feelings.

14:22.860 --> 14:26.900
Yes! The caterer is refunding
everything but the deposit. Mm.

14:26.990 --> 14:29.490
Hold it.
What about all the food they prepared?

14:29.570 --> 14:30.490
That's just gonna go to waste?

14:30.570 --> 14:33.290
Oh, no. I completely forgot.

14:33.910 --> 14:35.410
Oh, wait, no, I didn't.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.620
It's all being donated to the
homeless shelter that Dad and Sol support.

14:38.710 --> 14:41.630
-Shazam!
-OK.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.880
You're a mother of four.
Have some self-respect.

14:55.810 --> 14:57.020
Hey.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.690
-Did you get it?
-Uh, what? Your play?

15:02.650 --> 15:03.520
My hot dog.

15:03.610 --> 15:05.900
Oh, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

15:05.980 --> 15:08.030
The lady said I could have it.

15:08.110 --> 15:11.820
-What... What lady?
-Ella Fitzgerald.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.510
OK, I think I've got everything.

15:30.010 --> 15:32.300
Did you get the rest of your stuff?

15:33.350 --> 15:35.050
Frankie?

15:45.610 --> 15:47.400
For Pete's sake.

15:48.650 --> 15:49.650
Hey, now.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.120
Where's the stuff from Sol's list?

15:54.200 --> 15:56.540
How should I know? I'm on strike.

15:56.620 --> 15:59.450
I'm lying upside-down on the job.

15:59.540 --> 16:02.210
Well, in case you haven't noticed,
we are in crisis-mode now.

16:02.290 --> 16:06.800
Oh, ple-- Yesterday was a crisis.
This is Sol wanting his Stim-u-dents.

16:06.880 --> 16:10.090
You have been acting
like a petulant teenager all day.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.840
-Whatever.
-No, seriously.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.760
You have got to let go
of some of this crap.

16:15.970 --> 16:17.560
I'm trying to.

16:17.640 --> 16:21.180
After the wedding, I felt almost good.
And what do you do?

16:21.270 --> 16:23.730
Drag me back to this hellscape.

16:23.810 --> 16:27.570
It's a place.
A house where people live. That's it.

16:27.650 --> 16:31.280
Oh, really? The minute you walked in here
you started getting twitchy.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.410
You don't want to be here
any more than I do.

16:33.490 --> 16:36.870
-It doesn't matter what I want.
-Oh, it exactly does matter.

16:36.950 --> 16:41.620
You are so caught up
in this bullshit obligation and what for?

16:41.710 --> 16:44.210
-What has it gotten you?
-Do we really have to answer

16:44.290 --> 16:46.840
every existential question
about our lives right now?

16:46.920 --> 16:48.040
No, no, not every one.

16:48.130 --> 16:50.550
But how about this one:
What do you want?

16:51.970 --> 16:54.550
-What?
-Right now. Right this minute.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.850
Of course. I-I'm not surprised.

17:01.930 --> 17:03.940
You couldn't even come up with one wish.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.569
Fine.

17:22.119 --> 17:23.790
Grace?

17:25.040 --> 17:26.290
Grace!

17:27.250 --> 17:29.090
A little help!

17:30.250 --> 17:31.380
Oh, shit.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.550
Hi. Is this Finn or Fergus?

17:33.630 --> 17:37.300
Oh, I have both of you.
I've bagged two pipers.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.350
Yes, we've hidden all
of Robert's valuables from the nurses.

17:40.430 --> 17:44.350
Well, uh, I don't think it matters
how Filipino she is, Aunt Irma.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.440
Well, I'm sure somebody
stole his socks,

17:46.520 --> 17:48.150
-but that is not what killed Uncle Dave.
-Get off.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.060
-Wait--
-Hi, Aunt Irma. Bye, Aunt Irma.

17:50.150 --> 17:52.530
And, Aunt Irma?
Get that racist shit together, OK?

17:52.610 --> 17:54.860
-Watch some documentaries.
-What the hell?

17:54.950 --> 17:56.700
Sorry, there's just way too much talking.

17:56.780 --> 17:59.700
We have over 60 people to do.
You know what, Bud,

17:59.780 --> 18:00.910
you're not capable of doing this.

18:00.990 --> 18:03.950
I am just going to send out an email blast
to the entire wedding list.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.370
-"To Whom It May Concern. Wedding off."
-Oh, that's friendly.

18:08.460 --> 18:09.630
-That's real friendly. Let me do it.
-What?

18:09.710 --> 18:13.010
No. You'll just do that feel-good
psychobabble bullshit subterfuge.

18:13.090 --> 18:15.720
-It's called being human.
-No, it's called being a pussy.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.470
But just get to the facts, pussy.

18:17.550 --> 18:18.470
-You want the facts?
-Yes.

18:18.550 --> 18:20.180
You want the facts?
I'll give you the facts!

18:20.260 --> 18:23.890
How about "Dear Beloved Guest,
Sol fucked Frankie,

18:23.970 --> 18:26.520
and Robert had a heart attack
because he eats sausage for every meal.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.520
That's not a gay thing.
He really eats a lot of sausage.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.190
But everything's fucked
because they got married anyway.

18:32.270 --> 18:35.230
Wedding canceled. Send gifts.
Fuck you!"

18:35.320 --> 18:36.610
-Happy now?
-Yes.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.030
Ho--

18:39.450 --> 18:41.280
-Oh.
-No.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.240
No.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.500
What the hell?

18:58.470 --> 19:00.970
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:01.050 --> 19:02.680
Come here.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.980
Why did you use all those drugs?

19:11.690 --> 19:12.810
Um...

19:15.150 --> 19:17.440
I guess because...

19:17.530 --> 19:21.360
I only really liked myself
when I was on them.

19:23.740 --> 19:25.280
Why didn't you come talk to me?

19:27.290 --> 19:28.450
I...

19:30.040 --> 19:32.380
didn't know I could. I...

19:32.460 --> 19:34.500
Always.

19:46.970 --> 19:48.180
Stop it.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.350
OK.

19:50.350 --> 19:52.850
The bad news is that
the email did go wide.

19:52.940 --> 19:55.480
The good news is that
it was auto-corrected.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.400
-Uh-huh.
-Oh, God, what did it say?

19:58.280 --> 20:00.400
"Dear Beloved Guzzle,

20:00.490 --> 20:03.870
Vin Diesel fucked Frankie,
and Robert hatha yard attack

20:03.950 --> 20:06.530
be causal bleeds Sausalito,
California every day."

20:12.830 --> 20:16.210
Oh, my God, I am so relieved
it was Vin Diesel who slept with my mom.

20:17.090 --> 20:20.340
-OK. It's OK.
-Guys, that was really scary.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.470
- Phew.
- Woo!

20:35.940 --> 20:38.780
Whoa. Whoa. Head rush.

20:47.910 --> 20:50.200
Oh, come on.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.500
That thing you said about suing people
got my attention.

20:55.580 --> 20:59.550
So I chatted up a few folks,
and you know what?

20:59.630 --> 21:02.220
Everybody I met owes this hospital money.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.640
But how can that be?
How is this happening?

21:06.760 --> 21:09.100
Since this isn't my area of the law,

21:09.180 --> 21:12.980
I ran my questions
by a colleague in malpractice

21:13.060 --> 21:18.060
and she told me that in addition to having
a very high rate of billing code error,

21:18.150 --> 21:23.400
you guys have set a record
in the area for surprise charges,

21:23.490 --> 21:26.490
and litigating against patients,

21:26.570 --> 21:29.660
and I'm pretty sure
that under the Affordable Care Act,

21:29.740 --> 21:34.660
Federal Regulation 7-8-9-5-4,
you're not supposed to do that.

21:36.210 --> 21:38.500
Funny. This isn't my area,

21:38.580 --> 21:42.840
but I've learned so much today
I'd like to branch out.

21:42.920 --> 21:43.920
What do you say?

21:44.010 --> 21:48.260
Maybe I move into class action
and I represent these good people

21:48.340 --> 21:50.640
and we sue your hospital's ass off?

21:53.600 --> 21:56.100
I'll just get my manager.

21:56.190 --> 22:01.110
Your constraints mean nothing to me.
My feet are like sparrows.

22:01.190 --> 22:02.650
Fly, feet.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.700
You fat flightless penguins.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.490
Ah...

22:13.790 --> 22:16.250
Yes. Jackpot.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.840
I thought you left.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.800
I figured you might need a ride home.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.430
How'd you get out of that thing?

22:30.510 --> 22:33.220
I jimmied my way out
with Sol's pocketknife,

22:33.310 --> 22:36.640
which he keeps with his nighttime
peanut butter and cracker kit,

22:36.730 --> 22:40.690
which I would never have known about
if I didn't know him so damn well.

22:40.770 --> 22:43.690
-That's ironic.
-Oh, knowledge.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.570
Get out of my head and don't come back.

22:46.650 --> 22:50.320
-Be gone. Forever.
-I-- Hold this, will you?

22:50.410 --> 22:51.870
I gotta move this ottoman.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.330
It is so wrong it's driving me crazy.

22:55.410 --> 22:58.750
How anyone in God's name
would want to put an...

23:06.210 --> 23:09.470
That's why the coffee table
is way out there.

23:10.550 --> 23:13.180
And why they put the ottoman here.

23:13.260 --> 23:15.430
So they can sit here.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.810
Under this blanket with their feet up.
Together.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.150
It's not all wrong.

23:26.230 --> 23:30.030
It's just the house of two people
who could give a fuzzy rat's ass

23:30.110 --> 23:34.660
where things are supposed to go
as long as they're next to each other.

23:37.370 --> 23:39.160
It's warm.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.090
It wasn't like this when I lived here.

23:48.550 --> 23:49.760
Oh, thanks.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.550
I'm sorry that I lashed out.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.220
Oh, it's OK.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.680
What you said about
my not having a wish, it's true.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.270
But see, the thing is...

24:00.140 --> 24:03.230
I don't have any practice
because I don't actually make wishes.

24:03.310 --> 24:06.110
-Never have.
-Come on. Not even on your birthday?

24:06.190 --> 24:07.610
Mm.

24:07.690 --> 24:10.490
No. It's too stressful.
Everybody wants cake.

24:10.570 --> 24:11.860
Not even when you were a kid?

24:11.950 --> 24:17.240
I used to tell myself I'd do it after
everybody left the party, but I never did.

24:17.330 --> 24:19.870
And then it became easier
not to make any wishes at all.

24:19.950 --> 24:22.580
Yeah, don't ever make them,
can't ever be disappointed.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.420
Exactly.

24:25.500 --> 24:29.130
You might want to get on that before,
you know, you like, expire.

24:30.220 --> 24:31.880
-How?
-Well, if I had to guess,

24:31.970 --> 24:35.220
I'd say black mold or disgruntled waiter.

24:37.260 --> 24:38.720
You...

24:40.890 --> 24:41.930
So?

24:43.900 --> 24:46.230
What? A... a wish?

24:48.360 --> 24:51.190
-Can I start small?
-Of course.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.450
OK.

24:59.370 --> 25:03.080
I wish I didn't have to schlep
all this stuff back to the hospital.

25:03.160 --> 25:06.420
Well, now that's a wish
we can do something about.

25:08.130 --> 25:10.460
And I'd also like to make amends
for drinking all the crème de menthe

25:10.550 --> 25:12.550
at Thanksgiving and blaming it on Brianna.

25:12.630 --> 25:15.550
Well, she did do a lot of other things.

25:15.630 --> 25:19.510
Yeah, but she didn't steal your cigars and
re-sell them for cash, that was also me.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.100
I burned down your tool shed, I stole
the Virgin Mary from your nativity scene--

25:23.180 --> 25:25.560
That's it.
I'm good with your amends.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.570
-Hello, love!
-You're awake.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.860
-There's my husband.
-How are you feeling?

25:32.940 --> 25:34.650
-I'm great.
-Hello.

25:34.740 --> 25:35.740
I missed you.

25:39.030 --> 25:40.790
Jeez. You had the easy job.

25:40.870 --> 25:43.330
-I got really lucky.
-Mm.

25:43.410 --> 25:46.210
-Hi, Daddy.
-Aw, here are my babies.

25:46.290 --> 25:48.500
-You're back! I was-- Oh. Sorry.
-What?

25:48.580 --> 25:49.920
Are you OK?

25:50.000 --> 25:52.090
Yeah. Yeah.

25:55.470 --> 25:58.260
It's just some boring cramps
from the babies I'm gonna have.

25:58.340 --> 26:02.560
-Babies? You're having twins?
-Wait a second, you're pregnant?

26:02.640 --> 26:04.310
Why didn't you tell us?

26:04.390 --> 26:06.640
Well, Dad, I didn't want
to steal your medical thunder.

26:06.730 --> 26:09.810
Give us a hug! Oh, sweetheart.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.270
It's Mom.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.030
Hey, hey. Don't say anything
about the babies, OK?

26:13.110 --> 26:14.150
I'll tell her later.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.530
-Thank you.
-Mazel tov.

26:16.610 --> 26:17.860
Hi, honey.

26:17.950 --> 26:19.490
-Thanks, Lucy!
-Uh-huh.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.830
-You're a pal.
-Oh, it's my pleasure.

26:21.910 --> 26:23.160
How's your dad?

26:23.240 --> 26:24.700
-He's great.
-<i>Good. Listen,</i>

26:24.790 --> 26:26.910
sweetheart, change of plan, um...

26:27.000 --> 26:30.170
We're sending a friend to bring Sol's
stuff and then I'm taking Frankie home.

26:30.250 --> 26:34.170
- Oh, by way of Del Taco.
- By way of Del Taco.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.130
Get some rest, Mom.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.380
-We love you.
-Love you, too.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.760
Let me see it again.

26:41.550 --> 26:42.760
Oh.

26:42.850 --> 26:44.520
Whatever, Mary Lou.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.230
Why don't you work at McDonald's?

26:46.310 --> 26:48.600
Oh, God, I've never loved you more.

26:48.690 --> 26:51.400
I know. I learned it from my grandson.

26:51.480 --> 26:54.440
-You ready to go?
-Wait. One thing.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.530
I know how to say "bullshit"
in American Sign.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.620
Because see? The bull.

27:03.540 --> 27:04.660
Now I'm ready.

27:08.250 --> 27:13.210
- Oh, oh!
- My babies. They're back.

27:13.290 --> 27:16.510
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.270
Who's Vin Diesel?
