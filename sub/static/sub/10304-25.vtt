02:04.600 --> 02:05.919
Okay, Griff.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.430
ln 1 960, Cassius Clay
won the Olympic gold medal...

02:09.639 --> 02:11.676
...by defeating what boxer?

02:11.960 --> 02:14.235
Let's see.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.713
lt's on the tip of her tongue--
l mean, my tongue.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.109
Give me that.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.239
He defeated this guy.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.148
Come on, Griff.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.954
The winner of the sports radio contest
gets two tickets...

02:38.160 --> 02:39.832
...to the summer Olympics in Atlanta.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.553
That's me and you, buddy.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.155
l never knew you were a big fan
of the Olympics, Al.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.915
l'm not, but l'm a huge fan
of leaving home.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.750
You know all the answers,
why don't you call in?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.309
Because l was banned
from the radio station...

02:54.520 --> 02:56.636
...for making one innocent comment.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.394
What did you say?

02:58.600 --> 03:00.636
l simply said,
we can put a man on the moon...

03:00.840 --> 03:04.150
...but we've yet to build
an attractive woman golfer.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.313
And?

03:08.560 --> 03:14.351
Okay. Who holds the world record
for the longest standing broad jump?

03:14.960 --> 03:17.269
Me, if she doesn't move.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.674
l was wondering, if l said
you had a beautiful body...

03:22.880 --> 03:25.235
...would you hold it against me?

03:27.440 --> 03:31.228
Are we near the airport, or is that
the sound of my heart taking off?

03:33.960 --> 03:35.109
What's your sign?

03:39.640 --> 03:42.029
Yeah, she wants me.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.792
Okay, this baby
is our ticket to Atlanta.

03:46.040 --> 03:47.598
What the hell is this?

03:47.840 --> 03:50.798
l got this from the ClA surplus store.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.393
This bad boy blocks all phone calls
to the radio station except mine.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.912
l'm Calvin Farquhar.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.875
And it's time for Sports Radio 600
Olympic trivia contest.

04:18.079 --> 04:21.277
Answer three questions correctly,
you and a friend are off to Atlanta.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.159
lt's showtime, Griff.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.635
You do it, Al.
They can't hate you that much.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.838
This contest is open to everyone
except Sports Radio employees...

04:29.040 --> 04:31.554
...and Al Bundy.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.912
You're mouthing with Calvin.
Who's this?

04:39.320 --> 04:40.548
Griff.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.518
Griff, my man, you have a last name?

04:43.480 --> 04:45.038
X, Griff X.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.438
Are you Muslim, as in Malcolm X?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.959
No, l'm divorced,
as in screwed over by the ex.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.714
She got everything, you know?

05:03.280 --> 05:04.998
Keep your problems
to yourself, man.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.878
This isn't Frasier.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.878
Okay, first question.

05:09.120 --> 05:12.396
Who was named the outstanding boxer
in the 1 988 Olympics...

05:12.640 --> 05:15.200
... despite being cheated
out of a gold medal?

05:16.880 --> 05:18.233
Roy Jones Jr.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.037
Correct.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.157
Now name the first American city
that hosted the Summer Olympics.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.908
St. Louis.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.798
St. Louis.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.951
Correct again.

05:34.680 --> 05:39.674
Griff, you can quit now and k eep the
El Pollo Loco 1 2-piece chick en dinner.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.278
l mean, 1 1 -piece chicken dinner...

05:44.520 --> 05:46.511
...or risk everything
and go for the gold.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.115
Do side dishes come
with that chicken?

05:50.880 --> 05:52.632
l mean, we'll go for the gold.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.679
We?

05:54.920 --> 05:56.797
You are alone, aren't you, Griff?

05:57.040 --> 05:58.678
Al Bundy's not there, is he?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.470
No. Absolutely not.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.678
Then name the only man in Olympic
history to win a gold medal...

06:04.880 --> 06:08.350
...in both Summer and Winter games,
and name the event.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.315
Eddie Eagan, boxing...

06:15.520 --> 06:17.829
...and--

06:18.360 --> 06:20.191
Bobsledding.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.632
Was that Al Bundy?

06:23.480 --> 06:25.072
No. That was me, Griff.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.518
When l get excited,
l sound Caucasian.

06:34.440 --> 06:37.830
You know, like that guy
from Hanging With Mr. Cooper.

06:39.280 --> 06:43.432
Well, congratulations, Griff.
You're going to Atlanta, man.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.958
We'll catch men's boxing.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.875
Then Shaq and the Dream Team take on
the always impressive Kuwaiti Five.

06:53.800 --> 06:57.110
Sometimes it's fun to root
for underdeveloped countries, Al.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.673
Speaking of underdeveloped.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.953
Hello, Griff. Hello, whiff.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.116
Listen, in preparation for your trip...

07:12.320 --> 07:14.880
...l've put together
some brochures of sights to see...

07:15.080 --> 07:17.275
...and things to do
while you're in Atlanta.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.398
Martin Luther King Junior Memorial...

07:20.640 --> 07:24.997
...Peachtree Plaza, and look,
the Jimmy Carter Peanut Museum.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.314
Thank you, Marcie,
and we will put this to good use.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.191
Wobble's gone.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.678
And yet the weeble's still here.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.989
Come on, Jefferson.
l'm going to Victoria's Secret.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.435
What in the world for?

07:46.240 --> 07:47.912
l mean, l'll meet you there.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.752
Bye-bye.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.116
All right, look, guys.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.669
Here's how to see
the real sights in Atlanta.

07:55.880 --> 07:59.589
Their official illustrated guide
to the nudie bars.

08:03.120 --> 08:06.317
The South shall rise again.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.434
And so shall we.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.637
Well, Marcie's gonna be
wondering what happened to me.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.871
ls Victoria's Secret
still down that way?

08:16.080 --> 08:18.116
-Yes.
-Thanks.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.276
Al, here comes
that sports-radio guy. Hide.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.630
Not to worry. He knows my voice,
not my face.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.032
Excuse me.

08:34.600 --> 08:38.639
l'm Calvin Farquhar
and are either of you Griff X?

08:39.520 --> 08:42.318
-l'm Mr. X.
-Nice to meet you.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.956
You'll have to excuse my friend,
Al-- Fredo.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.313
Alfredo. He doesn't talk much.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.590
Lost his tongue in the war.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.910
And a few other things too.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.716
Well, Griff, if you'll just
sign for these tickets.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.070
Sure. Have a seat.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.357
Hey, Dad.

09:08.520 --> 09:13.116
Can l go to Las Vegas
this weekend with....

09:15.240 --> 09:20.394
What was your name?
Oh, it doesn't matter. Can l go?

09:24.960 --> 09:28.111
Oh, well, thanks, Dad.
l won't get married or anything stupid.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.398
You're gonna let Kelly go to Vegas?

09:37.320 --> 09:39.834
You're not the Al Bund--

10:00.720 --> 10:02.870
Griff, the added bonus...

10:03.120 --> 10:06.510
...is that you get to carry
the Olympic torch through the mall.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.552
Well, that's quite an honour.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.711
But...

10:11.320 --> 10:14.357
...l'd rather let my friend
Alberto here carry it.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.630
You mean Alfredo, don't you?

10:16.880 --> 10:20.077
Yeah, Alfredo Alberto.

10:22.480 --> 10:26.871
He's an ltalian exchange salesman.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.033
Well, you are the winner,
and it's your choice.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.113
-Can we take a picture, please?
-Sure.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.431
Thank you very much,
and congratulations.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.073
Thank you.

10:44.320 --> 10:48.199
Griff, thanks to you, l will realise
one of my life's dreams:

10:48.400 --> 10:50.356
To carry the Olympic torch.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.031
l thought your life's dream
was to feel up Barbara Eden.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.670
Yeah, but l did that.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.112
Stroking the big screen at Sears
doesn't count.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.916
The point is, carrying that torch...

11:04.120 --> 11:08.159
...for me, will be like
scoring my fifth touchdown.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.833
Griff, there is a rumour
that's got me tingling all over.

11:18.040 --> 11:21.589
l hear you're carrying
the Olympic torch.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.752
Yes, l am.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.435
Excuse me, oh, back-stabber X.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.637
What do you mean
you're carrying the torch?

11:37.840 --> 11:40.718
Al, look at her. What would you do?

11:42.880 --> 11:45.394
Girls like that are a dime a dozen.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.118
There's my dime. Bring me a dozen.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.592
-What about friendship?
-What about my dime?

12:04.320 --> 12:06.629
Al, look.
We're still going to Atlanta.

12:06.840 --> 12:09.991
Besides, you're the only one who
gives a damn about that stupid torch.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.277
Are you the guy
carrying the Olympic torch?

12:15.520 --> 12:19.798
-For God and country.
-l thought you said that nobody had--

12:20.240 --> 12:22.629
We'd like to take pictures,
give you endorsements...

12:22.840 --> 12:25.070
-...and a free car.
-Sure.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.919
But as long as l can share it all
with my best friend.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.714
A person without whom
none of this would be possible.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.997
Yo, momma, baby,
they wanna give us a car.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.435
lf l kill Griff, get sentenced
to life in prison...

12:37.640 --> 12:39.471
...l'll be out in a couple of weeks.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.358
But l'll miss canola night
at the Jiggly Room.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.836
But they gotta have
the equivalent in prison.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.031
So l guess it will be worth it.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.915
Dad, l see you're still a little upset
about this Griff thing.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.078
Son, the TV is a thing.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.880
Your mother is a thing.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.319
But betrayal by your best friend
is high treason.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.319
Come on, Daddy, cheer up.
Let's watch some TV.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.988
-Maybe there's something good on.
-Watch a little tube.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.792
All right.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.074
Coming up on BET,
Griff asks O. J. the tough questions.

13:16.240 --> 13:19.710
Oh, we love Griff
Griff loves us

13:21.280 --> 13:25.273
That's not fair. That should be me
hugging that big purple idiot.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.318
My whole life has been
leading up to that moment.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.318
Dad, you said your life was leading up
to you leaving Mom.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.158
Well, it was.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.919
lt was, but l want to combine the two.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.634
Once l had that torch in my hand,
l would have just...

13:40.120 --> 13:42.315
...kept on running.

13:44.280 --> 13:49.195
-Daddy, you wanna know what l think?
-Oh, this should be good.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.193
Now, like a great
Eastern religion says...

13:53.440 --> 13:58.594
...it's all about striking a balance
between the ping and the pong.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.475
Go get my noose, boy.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.235
-l'll get two.
-Now, Dad, listen.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.075
Your misery, or the ping...

14:08.280 --> 14:12.193
...is what makes other people happy,
or pong.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.672
Pumpkin, Daddy's feeling
a little ping right now.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.234
Well, good.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.750
That means that somebody
somewhere must be really pong.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.389
Maybe it's me.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.630
She's been eating Wite-Out again,
hasn't she?

14:31.520 --> 14:34.034
Dad, Griff's your friend.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.838
Why can't you be happy for him?

14:36.040 --> 14:37.917
When was the last time
you saw me happy...

14:38.120 --> 14:39.951
...for anyone, about anything?

14:40.200 --> 14:42.794
Dad, Griff is a shoe salesman,
all right?

14:43.040 --> 14:47.556
He makes no money.
He drives a sardine can on wheels...

14:48.240 --> 14:51.835
...and he paints his ankles
so we'll think he can afford socks.

14:53.520 --> 14:54.794
The guy's got no life.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.554
But, son, that's my life.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.877
Then you can understand why
he deserves a little bit of happiness.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.712
Pumpkin, maybe you're right.

15:02.920 --> 15:06.071
Maybe l haven't been
such a good friend.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.750
Or a father.

15:09.520 --> 15:12.796
But maybe there's still something
l can do to make up for it.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.600
Dad, wanna go outside
and throw the ball a little bit?

15:16.080 --> 15:17.354
Not you.

15:19.040 --> 15:23.477
Griff, he's like family to me-- Better,
because he doesn't even live here.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.472
Tomorrow, l'm going
to the shoe store.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.240
l'll tell him he's my best friend
and l'm happy for him.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.590
Oh, Daddy, you're so good.

15:30.840 --> 15:34.833
l'm sure in your next life
you're going to be reincarcerated.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.636
Excuse me. l'm Roy Jones Jr.

15:52.240 --> 15:58.475
Undefeated, two-time world champion,
former Olympian Roy Jones Jr?

15:58.800 --> 16:00.597
l prefer to think of myself...

16:00.800 --> 16:05.476
...as '' pound for pound the best boxer
in the world'' Roy Jones Jr.

16:08.320 --> 16:12.836
Well, l prefer to think of myself as
'' high school football star'' Al Bundy.

16:14.880 --> 16:18.395
But unlike you, l got married.
Now my life...

16:18.600 --> 16:20.830
...is all screwed up.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.396
Well, enough about you.
ls Griff here?

16:23.640 --> 16:26.029
No, Griff's stretching,
getting ready for his big run.

16:26.240 --> 16:29.789
l'm his best friend, you know.
And l'm very happy for him.

16:31.120 --> 16:35.272
Well, you should be.
l mean, after all, he is America's hero.

16:37.040 --> 16:40.715
Give me that. America's hero?
l'm the one who--

16:41.720 --> 16:44.109
l'm the one who's his best friend...

16:44.400 --> 16:46.436
...and l'm very, very happy for him.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.274
Get your official
''Go Griff'' T-shirts here.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.913
Here you go. Hey. Thank you.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.469
Here you go. There you go.
That's it, right.

16:53.680 --> 16:58.231
Jefferson, l am so proud of you.
You finally got a job.

16:59.160 --> 17:03.472
Marcie, this isn't a job.
No, l'm giving away these T-shirts...

17:03.680 --> 17:05.636
...to promote global unity.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.152
Oh, you're such a good man.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.553
Excuse me.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.950
Aren't you Bruce Jenner?

17:26.040 --> 17:28.395
No, l am not.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.471
Are you sure?

17:31.280 --> 17:33.430
Don't make me knock you out.

17:33.680 --> 17:38.231
-Oh, can l get a Griff shirt?
-Oh, sure, you can. Come on over here.

17:44.760 --> 17:47.718
Alfredo, look who l got to help me
cover the Griff torch run.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.076
Super Bowl MVP Larry Brown.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.117
-Larry Brown.
-That's me.

17:52.320 --> 17:56.598
lt's a miracle.
Alfredo, the tongueless man, speaks.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.474
Aren't you Bruce Jenner?

18:04.720 --> 18:06.438
Can l have your autograph, please?

18:06.640 --> 18:08.790
Can l have your autograph, please?

18:09.800 --> 18:13.839
l'm Al Bundy. Did you come
because you got my letter?

18:14.040 --> 18:15.632
Yeah, right.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.469
l'm not here to see you.
l'm here to see Griff.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.278
But why? You're a Super Bowl hero.

18:20.520 --> 18:24.115
Even though that bum O'Donnell
threw those two passes right to you.

18:25.440 --> 18:31.276
Hey, l know that and you know that,
but Disneyland and the Raiders don't.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.276
And you know, l'd give it all up
to be in Griff's shoes today.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.114
Why? He's just a divorced
shoe salesman...

18:38.320 --> 18:42.029
...who's carrying a flaming stick
through a mall full of fat women.

18:42.480 --> 18:47.793
But l am his best friend
and l'm very happy for him.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.628
You ought to be.

18:49.880 --> 18:55.830
Hey, Larry, you wanna buy one
of these limited-edition, autographed...

18:56.040 --> 18:58.793
-...''Go Griff'' T-shirts?
-Sure.

19:00.480 --> 19:05.270
l don't have any cash on me right now,
but hey, how about a Super Bowl ring?

19:07.840 --> 19:09.478
Sure.

19:18.520 --> 19:21.478
Wow, l'll always treasure this.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.598
Me too. l'll never let it go.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.115
Anyone wanna buy
a Super Bowl ring?

19:32.120 --> 19:36.511
-Excuse me, pal.
-Hey, you're Flint Guccione...

19:36.760 --> 19:39.433
...publisher of Big 'Uns magazine.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.998
Right you are.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.391
Who would have thought an lnstamatic,
drunken family reunion...

19:45.600 --> 19:48.478
...and 50 bucks could start an empire?

19:49.840 --> 19:51.558
Don't tell me you came
to shake Griff's hand.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.797
l did that yesterday when l presented
him with his lifetime key...

19:55.000 --> 19:57.150
...to the Big 'Uns brothel.

19:57.360 --> 20:01.592
And today we're gonna make Griff
Big 'Uns Man Of The Year.

20:19.480 --> 20:23.553
Oh, Al, you're the man of the year.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.517
No. You're the man of the century.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.234
You're twice the man Griff is.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.870
That's why l cloned myself.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.952
Hey, everybody, it's Griff.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.195
Hey, he's got the torch.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.909
Those were my answers.
That should be my torch.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.348
l will be the flaming one.

21:03.800 --> 21:07.554
This is Miranda Veracruz
de la Jolla Cardenal...

21:07.760 --> 21:11.639
...live at the New Market Mall
where national hero, Griff X...

21:11.840 --> 21:14.991
...has just run by
with the Olympic torch.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.992
Wait a minute.

21:18.040 --> 21:20.600
Someone is chasing Griff.

21:20.840 --> 21:25.118
lt appears to be local hooligan
Al Bundy.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.272
Oh, no. He has knocked the torch
from Griff's hand...

21:30.480 --> 21:33.836
...and sent it hurtling
into the mall fountain.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.034
For the first time in 3000 years...

21:40.240 --> 21:43.437
... the Olympic flame
has been extinguished.

21:44.080 --> 21:48.437
The torch must now be relit in Athens
and run around the world once more.

21:48.680 --> 21:52.958
The Summer Olympics
have been postponed indefinitely.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.388
Thanks again...

21:54.640 --> 21:58.713
... to now international hooligan
Al Bundy.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.671
l guess you can look
on the bright side, Dad.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.189
From now on, when people think
of Olympic shame...

22:11.440 --> 22:15.353
...they'll think of Al Bundy first
and then Tonya Harding.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.594
Daddy, do you think it's safe
to go out for food now?

22:20.720 --> 22:23.518
Oh, pumpkin,
l wouldn't worry about it.

22:23.720 --> 22:28.635
You know, when it comes to scandals,
Americans have short memories.
