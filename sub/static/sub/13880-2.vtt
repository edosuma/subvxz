Uh-uh-uh, ooh.
Welcome to paradise.

00:11.300 --> 00:16.700
Now, leave all your worries and
other TV shows behind, baby.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.000
It's time "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:19.000 --> 00:20.500
"Aqua TV Show Show."

"Aqua TV Show Show."

00:22.000 --> 00:23.400
"Aqua TV Show Show."

00:23.400 --> 00:24.600
I said "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:24.600 --> 00:25.700
"Aqua TV Show Show."

00:25.700 --> 00:26.900

00:47.100 --> 00:48.300
Yeah! Whoo!

00:48.800 --> 00:49.800
Boom!

00:50.100 --> 00:51.500
Yeah!

00:51.500 --> 00:52.500
Woot!

00:53.600 --> 00:57.300
Wow. What... a... rush.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.500
As a three-time winner of your
prestigious award, I stand

01:01.500 --> 01:07.800
before you today and say, with complete
sincerity that I am number one!

01:08.100 --> 01:09.200
Pause here.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.700
Maybe I'll flex.

01:10.900 --> 01:13.200
Uh, who to thank, who to thank?

01:13.800 --> 01:16.600
Might pause here to make it look
like I'm thinking of someone.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
No one!

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Since no one gets the credit for
all the things I've done by

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
myself, for myself, to make
me the man I am today.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.900
Then I'm gonna flex again,
obvious standing ovation,

01:27.900 --> 01:31.200
- make out with the spokesmodel...
- Three-time winner?

01:31.400 --> 01:33.300
Coolest dude ever?

01:33.300 --> 01:34.900
Better build a bigger shelf.

01:35.100 --> 01:37.000
I'm a shoe-in for number four.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.100
Eh, these are pretty
light for trophies.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.200
You know these are all
hollow and plastic, right?

01:41.200 --> 01:42.100
Ergonomic.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.500
It's cool to go green,
not that you'd know.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.300
That's why I walk to the mall.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.400
Has nothing to do with the
fact that I don't have a car.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.200
So, who you competing
against in this thing?

01:50.400 --> 01:54.000
Look, y'all. I just got
nominated for a Dudie Award.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.300
Merely a child's fantasy.
Let me see that.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.300
Mm. Well, it does appear to be
the dudie letterhead and font.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.000
Time sensitive material.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.600
Mine said that, as well.

02:03.700 --> 02:06.100
"Dear occupant"...
That matches up.

02:06.100 --> 02:09.100
- Aha! No hologram!
- Yours doesn't, either.

02:09.199 --> 02:11.900
I know, so it's very easy
to counterfeit these.

02:12.100 --> 02:14.100
Isn't it, <i>Meatwad?</i>

02:14.100 --> 02:15.800
That means "fake it."

02:16.000 --> 02:17.400
Meatwad, I'm proud of you, man.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.000
See? You can do anything you
want if you put your mind to it.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.400
Except be cool.

02:21.500 --> 02:25.400
That's my department, so drop
out or get dropped hard!

02:25.700 --> 02:27.700
- On your head!
- Shake, quit being a dick.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.500
- But he started it!
- I didn't do nothing.

02:29.500 --> 02:32.800
You rolled in here to agitate me,
and I never do nothing to you!

02:32.900 --> 02:35.000
Here, Frylock. You got a letter.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.700
This is from the American Academy
of Cool Dude Excellence.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.300
It's real. There's no hologram!

02:42.500 --> 02:46.200
Well, looky looky. According to this, I'm
a judge for this year's Dudie Award.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.400
So I get to decide who's
cooler between the two of you.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.900
- Oh.
- Cool.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.600
It's a state of mind.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.200
Where did you get that?

02:55.600 --> 02:57.700
It's crappy, and
your game is weak!

02:58.100 --> 02:59.700
But can I see it?

02:59.700 --> 03:01.300
Is it 8 gigs? Let me just...

03:01.300 --> 03:02.900
Oh, look... it's broken.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.400
And I just fixed it.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.800
- Well, let me see it again.
- Shake, you better watch it.

03:10.800 --> 03:11.800
It's cool to be nice.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.600
And I'll show you
what else is cool.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.900
Oh, gross.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.600
I mean, this is awesome. Hoo.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.600
Just chillin' up here with my
boys, doing...

03:22.300 --> 03:25.800
chores, getting mad paid
through my allowance.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.600
Get the strawberry.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.600
Meatwad ain't
cleaning the gutters!

03:29.600 --> 03:32.700
Because Meatwad already took out
the trash and picked up his room.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.100
Well, we'll see how clean
it is after I get down.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.100
- Get that strawberry.
- Is that a racing game?

03:37.300 --> 03:39.000
Can I press your
fire button for you?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.600
You do the steering, and
I'll do the fire button.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.300
You know what's also cool?
It's cool to have responsibilities.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.900
Responsibilities are the bomb.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.100
Someone else seems to disagree.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.600
My goodness!

03:50.600 --> 03:52.300
"Meatwad suxes"?

03:52.400 --> 03:53.700
The nerve of Carl!

03:53.800 --> 03:56.500
I just helped him wax his
buttocks and backside.

03:56.500 --> 04:01.100
If it were in our yard, we could easily
take it down, but that's in Carl's yard.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.400
Shake, how'd it get there
in the first place?

04:02.400 --> 04:05.800
I don't know. But I do know that's
Carl's opinion, and unfortunately,

04:05.900 --> 04:08.700
that's what this country's
built on... opinions.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.700
You know, a cool person
would own up to the fact

04:11.700 --> 04:13.200
that they might have
done it themselves.

04:13.300 --> 04:18.200
I'm going to look up the word "cool" and see
if your definition is actually correct.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.500
Yeah, I knew this
day would come.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.200
You want to learn from the
master on how to be cool.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.800
- How did you know that?
- Go on into the kitchenette.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.800
Nuke me up a pepperoni-cheddar
hot sleeve.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.800
And then I can be cool like you?

04:33.800 --> 04:36.200
We'll take this one
hot sleeve at a time.

04:37.900 --> 04:38.700
No, no.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.000
No, no, no, you're not nodding yet!
You ain't agreeing with nobody.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.000
You are banging your head 'cause

04:45.100 --> 04:46.500
you're gonna wake the dead,

04:46.900 --> 04:48.400
and you are loving
every minute of it,

04:48.500 --> 04:51.400
and you love her hard,
until the break of dawn.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.200
And then you're gone.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.800
Frylock said it's cool to
have responsibilities.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.300
No. You know what I say to that?

04:58.300 --> 05:02.800
You crush responsibilities like
Angus Young at Donnington!

05:02.900 --> 05:06.200
1, 2, 1, 2! Follow my lead!

05:06.200 --> 05:08.100
I'm stomping! I'm mad!

05:08.100 --> 05:10.700
- You are in control!
- Yeah!

05:10.700 --> 05:12.200
I'm really feeling it, Carl!

05:12.200 --> 05:15.300
That's right. Even though you
rent, you own the place.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.800
Here. Tie five of these
around your leg.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.700
You might have to tie some together,
get it all the way around.

05:21.700 --> 05:24.600
So we're ready in case we
get bit by a rattlesnake.

05:24.600 --> 05:28.000
Rattlesnakes grow legs and they
run when they see us coming.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
They don't want any of our venom,
because we sting like the scorpion.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.400
Boom-chikka-boom-boom!

05:35.500 --> 05:37.200
No, no. Don't say that.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.700
You say "sweet nectar" when
something good happens.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.700
What are you do... What are you
doing, there? That's a neckerchief.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.900
What poster have you ever seen where
they put the zebra stripe around a leg?

05:46.900 --> 05:49.800
- This is hair metal 101.
- Oh. I got it.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.300
So this is for catching crumbs.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.700
Oh, now you got a head
bandana down there?

05:53.900 --> 05:56.700
Oh, come on.
I color-coded these.

05:56.700 --> 06:01.900
You wrap it like so, so no one
can see the flesh tundra beneath

06:01.900 --> 06:04.500
'cause it's covered
up with rebellion.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.400
I can barely feel my "Star
Wars" wallet in this.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.500
These pockets and zippers,
they're for show. They're not for go.

06:10.600 --> 06:11.900
It adds to the mystery.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.200
"What's he got in there?

06:13.200 --> 06:15.600
Mint, change, sex condoms?"

06:15.600 --> 06:17.100
Ooh, I hope it's sex condoms.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.900
And when the valet says you
ain't supposed to self-park,

06:20.100 --> 06:23.100
you open the pocket and
you pull out this.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.300
The finger! I know that move!

06:25.300 --> 06:30.000
I do it behind Frylock's back, but I know
he feels it, the waves coming off of it.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.100
Lexi, wait!
No, no. Don't go.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.600
Peel off another $20 for her.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.800
And then that's when I
get to sit in the chair?

06:41.800 --> 06:45.000
No. 'Cause it's cool to
be cool to your friends.

06:45.500 --> 06:50.200
She'll be ready for you if she's
not too wiped out after I'm done

06:50.200 --> 06:53.100
satisfying her with this, uh...

06:53.400 --> 06:55.000
Lap dance she's doing.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.600
But you're not doing nothing.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.300
And it's driving her wild.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.900
Look at her face.

07:00.900 --> 07:05.500
See how she's craving me to stay
seated and not touch her at all?

07:05.700 --> 07:08.000
Go to the ATM and get
me 400 more bucks.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.900
And you just may have
earned your diploma.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.100
Boom-chikka-boom-boom!

07:13.100 --> 07:15.000
No, you say "sweet nectar"!

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Remember the fundamentals!

07:17.600 --> 07:19.700
I sure hope I win
that Dudie Award.

07:19.700 --> 07:23.100
You know, Meatwad, sometimes knowing
you did a good job is reward enough.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.600
And sometimes winning a big
trophy is award enough...

07:26.700 --> 07:28.600
What are you jags looking at?

07:28.700 --> 07:31.500
Probably never saw
anything as cool as me.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.600
Look, y'all, I got to come clean.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.200
I'm not the judge for
the Dudie Awards, okay?

07:36.200 --> 07:37.200
What about the letter?

07:37.200 --> 07:39.500
It said "dear occupant,"
and there was no hologram!

07:39.500 --> 07:41.300
I got nominated
for a Dudie, too.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.200
They just send that
out to everybody.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.300
- It's just some mail-order scam.
- Tell it to the hand, man!

07:46.300 --> 07:49.400
Ooh! It's called
fingerless gloves!

07:49.400 --> 07:52.800
So get off my case and
get off my cloud!

07:52.900 --> 07:55.100
'Cause there's smokin'
in this boys rooms.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.400
Shake, look at this, man.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.800
They want you to show up at these awards so
they can sell you some condos in Nevada.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.000
I'll see you squares
at the Dudies!

08:02.000 --> 08:05.900
And you can take a long
walk off a longer pier,

08:06.100 --> 08:10.400
which crosses a lake where
I put jumping killer sharks...

08:10.500 --> 08:12.700
And now you walk on the pier.

08:12.800 --> 08:13.900
Lates!

08:17.600 --> 08:18.800
Frickin' skate!

08:19.800 --> 08:22.900
Carl, you're here to cheer me on.
Thanks, man.

08:22.900 --> 08:26.000
I'm here, Shake,
because I'm nominated.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.200
You too?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.000
Well, where'd you get the moped?

08:31.000 --> 08:34.799
This is a chopper, and I
rented it so I could blow your

08:34.799 --> 08:36.799
ass out of the water.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.200
Well, good luck, 'cause
you're gonna need it.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.700
But...

08:40.799 --> 08:43.400
Here's a little something I bought
for you, for all your help.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.900
Ohh!

08:45.900 --> 08:47.100
Tweet-tweet!

08:47.700 --> 08:50.500
You know this is all just a
scam to sell us a condo, right?

08:50.600 --> 08:53.100
- But you look cool.
- I know I'm cool.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.500
I'm cool as hell.

08:54.500 --> 08:58.500
But as soon as I get my trophy,
and I get done pounding this

08:58.500 --> 09:02.400
vegetable tray, I'm out
of here like last year.

09:02.400 --> 09:07.100
But as soon as I win, I'm out of here
like an empty canister of beer.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.600
Hey! Welcome, dudes
and dudettes!

09:14.700 --> 09:17.900
Are you ready for the award
for the coolest dude ever?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.200
Whatevs!

09:20.200 --> 09:22.500
Before we do anything, let's
take a look at these lovely

09:22.600 --> 09:25.000
townhomes in lush Salt Lick, Nevada.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.500
Wouldn't it be cool to
live in one of these?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.800
- I said, "whatevs!"
- I know what you're saying.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.700
You're saying,
"Wait a minute, cool guy!

09:31.900 --> 09:35.500
Isn't that where they tested all those
nuclear warheads a few years ago?"

09:35.700 --> 09:37.200
Yes, I'm afraid that's true.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.300
<i>But</i> there's no scientific
evidence linking recent

09:40.300 --> 09:44.700
radiation to giant mantle-dwelling
fang worms, so does that sound cool?!

09:47.100 --> 09:50.300
I don't know why they couldn't have just
given us the trophies at the thing.

09:50.300 --> 09:53.100
I mean, we got to schlep all the
way out to Nevada for the trophy?

09:53.100 --> 09:54.500
- Come on.
- Chill out, dad.

09:54.700 --> 09:57.400
He promised that this open house
was gonna be the shizzle

09:57.600 --> 10:00.000
and that there's gonna be
some kick-ass snacks!

10:00.200 --> 10:03.200
Did you see the flier? They
had slot machines in there

10:03.200 --> 10:05.500
and girls that were smiling as
they got out of a pool,

10:05.500 --> 10:07.700
like real, you know,
suggesting stuff.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.200
- And I don't see no pool.
- I see a fool.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.900
Stupid, I'm cool! And it hurts!

10:17.000 --> 10:20.200
And now that guy's gonna see me now
and know that I've been crying!

10:20.200 --> 10:23.300
Everything all right back there?
Is everything... cool?

10:23.300 --> 10:25.600
Yeah. Hay fever.
I got allergies.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.300
They're not the bomb.

10:27.300 --> 10:30.800
So, what's the dealy-o with
these two-bed, two-baths, yo?

10:31.000 --> 10:35.600
Hey, I've seen the flier, and I don't
see no slots and I don't see no sluts.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.500
But I do see...
What is that? Is that a missile?

10:38.500 --> 10:42.100
Let's go check out this spacious basement
really quick! I mean, really, really quick!

10:45.000 --> 10:46.200
What's this?

10:46.600 --> 10:49.200
Oh, this? It's a fang worm.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.400
I'm-a go get
everyone some humus.

10:55.500 --> 11:18.400
