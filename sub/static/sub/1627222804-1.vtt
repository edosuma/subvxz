[singing in Spanish]

00:43.460 --> 00:45.462
[chattering]

00:47.047 --> 00:48.048
[horn honking]

00:48.131 --> 00:51.134
All right, baby. So, what color
do you want for your beach umbrella?

00:51.218 --> 00:54.555
I picked indigo.
Shit, I don't even know what indigo is.

00:54.638 --> 00:57.599
Also, look. Do you want a girl or a guy
for our couples massage?

00:57.683 --> 01:00.852
Ooh. I don't actually think
I want a couples massage with you.

01:00.936 --> 01:01.770
Why not?

01:01.853 --> 01:05.357
Well, baby, because you're always
moaning and groaning and saying stuff
like,

01:05.440 --> 01:07.943
"Ooh, yeah. Right there. Right there.
Ooh, yeah. Don't stop." [sighs]

01:08.026 --> 01:09.152
Yeah. I be into it, man.

01:09.236 --> 01:12.281
When they touching the right spot, can't
help but let 'em know how good it is.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.865
The masseuse likes that.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.909
And plus, I have so much tension, baby.

01:15.993 --> 01:19.037
Maybe you wouldn't have so much
tension if you weren't always on your
phone.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.373
Baby, I'm working on four projects
at the same time.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.375
We gotta use different builders
all across the city.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.418
You know--

01:25.168 --> 01:27.087
-But you know what? You're right.
-Hmm.

01:27.170 --> 01:30.257
I'ma put this away, and no more phones
for the rest of this vacation.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.717
-[cell phone rings]
-Oh, hold up.

01:32.259 --> 01:35.804
Hi, Daddy.
No, this is fine. We just landed.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.181
Yeah. Marcus, there he is.

01:38.265 --> 01:41.393
[Latin music continues]

01:43.520 --> 01:47.482
Yeah, Daddy. The flight was fine.
Yeah, I'm here with Marcus.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.361
Still.
[whispering] We have talked about this.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.740
Daddy, I know. I do love him.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.076
[phone rings]

01:58.160 --> 01:59.119
Front desk.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.704
Can you connect me with Maurillio?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.749
Speaking, Mr. Parker.

02:03.832 --> 02:04.958
How'd you know it was me?

02:05.042 --> 02:07.085
Uh, let's just say
after eight or nine calls,

02:07.169 --> 02:10.047
I become very much acquainted
with the timbre of your voice.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.716
I'm just calling you to confirm
you set up everything we discussed.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.885
Yes. Yes, yes.
I have personally seen to it.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.471
The Dom Pérignon,
the rose petals in the bed,

02:17.554 --> 02:21.350
the Bill Withers playlist
"Greatest Hits: No Deep Cuts."

02:21.433 --> 02:24.311
Sir, if she says no after all this,
I will marry you.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.938
All right, Maurillio. Not-- Not you too--

02:27.022 --> 02:29.274
[man chanting]

02:29.358 --> 02:32.235
[whooping]

02:32.319 --> 02:33.820
[Maurillio] <i>Sir? You trailed off.</i>

02:33.904 --> 02:35.530
All good. <i>Gracias</i>.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.866
Oh, baby, look at those two.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.285
-What? These lunatics?
-What? No.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.996
They look like they're having fun.
We should try that.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.790
-That looks fun to you?
-Yes.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.626
That's the reason why you don't see a lot
of Black paraplegics. You know why?

02:47.709 --> 02:49.169
'Cause we don't do stupid shit like that.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.755
Look at 'em. They riding around
like they got no insurance.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.758
[engine revving]

02:54.841 --> 02:58.887
[woman] Oh, my God. This is the hotel?

02:58.970 --> 03:02.933
Maybe it's not too late for us to get
a room at the Best Western by the
airport.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.603
[both laughing]

03:06.687 --> 03:10.982
Mr. Parker! And you must be Emily.
I'm Maurillio, the manager.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.902
Please help yourselves to a papaya paleta

03:13.985 --> 03:16.697
powdered in our house-roasted
guajillo-cacao rub.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.907
Oh. I don't know what this is, but cheers!

03:18.990 --> 03:20.951
You must be very eager
to get to your suite

03:21.034 --> 03:24.079
where there may or may not be
a surprise waiting for you.

03:24.663 --> 03:25.997
-A surprise?
-[Maurillio] Hmm.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.250
I don't know. Let's find out.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.711
-Hmm.
-Okay. [giggles]

03:30.794 --> 03:33.130
[Maurillio] Now, Emily,
I want you to know something.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.091
This man right here,
he loves you very, very much.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.384
Yes, he does.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.261
[giggles] But how do you know that?

03:39.344 --> 03:41.513
Let's just say I have a feeling.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.390
[chuckles]

03:43.473 --> 03:44.474
Ladies first.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.228
So that you may be the first one
to see what awaits, if anything.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.438
There could be nothing.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.857
-What the fuck is your problem?
-What is it?

03:51.940 --> 03:53.734
-What the fuck? You giving out clues.
-It's fine.

03:53.817 --> 03:54.818
-It's not fine!
-It's fine.

03:54.901 --> 03:55.902
-No, it's not!
-Come on.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.988
[Latin pop music playing]

03:59.781 --> 04:03.285
-Ah. We have finally arrived.
-Thank you.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.412
-Ahhh.
-Okay.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.499
<i>Señora</i>,
may you always remember this moment.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.251
For the rest of your life.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.129
-Okay. [giggles]
-Ooh. We could take a picture of this.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.968
["Lovely Day" playing]

04:20.051 --> 04:22.304
Oh. [whimpers]

04:28.769 --> 04:30.854
I cannot apologize enough.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.981
It seems the guests
in the Presidential Suite

04:33.064 --> 04:34.941
above your room overfilled the Jacuzzi.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.277
So, that means you're gonna put us
in another room, right?

04:37.360 --> 04:38.487
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.697
If there was room available,
it would be yours.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.533
Sadly, the hotel is fully booked.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.453
Why would you say "of course"
if you knew you didn't have another
room?

04:46.536 --> 04:47.788
You know how misleading that is?

04:47.871 --> 04:50.165
Can you just check
with any of the other hotels nearby?

04:50.248 --> 04:54.503
Of course. We have relationships with all
of the five-star hotels. No problem.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.004
Just a second.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.297
Hmm.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.509
Well, let me go ahead and also check
for four-star hotels.

05:01.218 --> 05:04.179
Ah. You know, a lot of people have issues
with three-star hotels,

05:04.262 --> 05:07.015
but they are just as good
as five-star hotels.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.560
Yeah, after three,
it's, like, too much, you know?

05:10.644 --> 05:12.562
[typing]

05:12.646 --> 05:14.898
And there you have it.

05:14.981 --> 05:19.194
One-star hotel with a great room
at the Airport Best Western.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.612
Are you fucking kidding me?

05:20.695 --> 05:23.657
Well, according to this, sir,
it is the best Western in the area.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.493
Let me tell you something, okay?
I had an itinerary planned.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.037
We was gonna go whale watching,
we was gonna go tequila tasting.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.541
-I booked a dinner at sunset on the
beach! -[man] Maurillio!

05:32.624 --> 05:34.125
-Where is that son of a bitch?
-[woman] Yes!

05:34.209 --> 05:37.420
Maurillio! My <i>amigo</i>.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.631
Thank you so much for
that Jet Ski hookup.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.550
Man, we felt some killer waves
on the second break.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.177
-Oh, my gosh. Then we got high as shit.
-We did.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.763
So we literally had to jump off
and go body surfing.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.849
Yeah, but we turned around
and the Jet Ski was gone.

05:48.932 --> 05:52.978
But don't freak out because I actually
took a photo of exactly where we left it.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.563
You are gonna have no problem finding it.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.022
[man] She's the brains.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.108
Okay, okay. Thank you, <i>señora</i>.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.192
You're welcome. [giggles]

05:59.276 --> 06:02.612
Excuse me, lady with the phone
in the goddamn sandwich bag.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.030
Hi. How are you guys?

06:04.114 --> 06:05.949
Were you guys having a conversation?

06:06.032 --> 06:09.953
'Cause you assumed that Maurillio
wasn't already talking to somebody.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.414
You just walk your happy ass in here
and cut me off.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.749
Now, look. I don't mean to snap.
It's a lot going on right now.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.209
-I'm a little stressed out.
-It's okay.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.169
I just wanna holler at him real quick.
Can I do that?

06:18.253 --> 06:19.713
-Yeah. You enjoy your day.
-Thank you.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.214
Enjoy this gorgeous weather.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.300
[laughs]

06:24.843 --> 06:28.263
Maurillio. You do know how important
this trip is to us, man.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.473
Yes, of course.
We want your proposal to be perfect.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.768
-Proposal?
-Oh, shit.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.229
-[Emily] Baby.
-No, no. I will fix this.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.772
Emily.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.779
-I am sorry. I cannot fix it.
-Fuck you, Maurillio!

06:44.863 --> 06:45.906
That's fair.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.992
Babe, come over here.
Let me talk to you.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.329
-Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes.
-You guys have a good one. [giggles]

06:53.330 --> 06:54.956
-Did she text you back?
-Nah, not yet.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.875
I'm sorry this didn't go as I planned it.

06:58.877 --> 06:59.878
Look, um…

07:00.378 --> 07:01.546
Oh, my God.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.131
[Marcus] I might as well do it up.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.424
Okay, I'm just try--

07:04.507 --> 07:06.801
-My flow is all thrown off.
-It's okay. Just keep going.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.261
Just please, just keep going.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.346
[Marcus] Baby, um…

07:10.931 --> 07:12.933
-Shut up!
-[Marcus] Look, you mean so much to
me.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.310
-Baby, I love you so much.
-[breathes shakily]

07:15.393 --> 07:17.854
And I know today has been
all over the place…

07:17.938 --> 07:19.022
[sighs]

07:19.105 --> 07:20.482
…and I can be a bit of a control freak,

07:20.565 --> 07:22.525
and when stuff ain't going my way,
I get all uptight,

07:22.609 --> 07:24.402
-and I overthink things…
-Oh, baby.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.863
…but the one thing
I could never think twice about…

07:28.865 --> 07:30.116
is how much I actually love you.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.873
-Baby, will you marry me?
-[gasps]

07:39.376 --> 07:40.669
Yes! [chuckles]

07:40.752 --> 07:42.921
-Oh, yes!
-Oh, my God.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.715
-Yes! Yeah! Fucking A, Maurillio. Yes!
-Yes!

07:45.799 --> 07:47.717
-[man] You had me! You were like…
-[woman] That was beautiful!

07:47.801 --> 07:50.136
"The only thing
I didn't need to think about was you."

07:50.220 --> 07:51.805
You guys! It was you.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.474
It was-- Baby, I love you!
I love you so much.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.018
Baby, I love you so much. I love you.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.437
And you know what,
I don't care that we lost the room.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.940
I know.
I know how hard you worked. I don't
care.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.901
We can camp out on the beach.
I just wanna be your woman!

08:04.985 --> 08:07.195
No! No! Nobody's camping on the beach.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.614
-You get that out of your head right now.
-I love you guys.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.367
-Like, you have to stay with us.
-With us.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.078
Consider it, like, our engagement present
to your beautiful souls.

08:15.161 --> 08:15.996
Yes.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.415
-Nah. Yeah. Yeah. We're okay.
-Nah, we good. Yeah. We're fine.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.834
You're gonna say no
to the Presidential Suite?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.919
It has a Jacuzzi and everything.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.131
[Latin music playing]

08:28.508 --> 08:32.512
I know we gave that tub a rough ride,
but what happened to craftsmanship,
right?

08:32.595 --> 08:33.930
-[footsteps approaching]
-Eh.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.142
Okay. So I had them move your bags
to the master suite.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.269
Oh, girl. That is way too much.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.353
What? No, no, no.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.605
Get yourselves comfortable.
You are our guests.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.315
It is truly the least we can do

08:44.399 --> 08:48.153
after our wonky 'cuzzi fucked up
your totally beautiful proposal.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.612
Well, look. Maybe…

08:51.197 --> 08:52.407
Maybe for tonight, okay?

08:52.490 --> 08:53.867
-Until we get another hotel.
-Yes!

08:53.950 --> 08:56.494
-Yes! Oh, boy!
-Settled. Who's thirsty?

08:56.578 --> 08:57.954
Sit, sit, sit. Get comfortable.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.791
Oh, if you guys are worried about privacy
and you wanna get really kinky tonight--

09:01.875 --> 09:02.917
We're extremely loud.

09:02.959 --> 09:06.838
I don't know what these walls are made
of, but you seriously can't hear anything!

09:07.338 --> 09:08.465
Okay. Listen.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.716
[door closes]

09:10.383 --> 09:12.552
[woman screams]

09:12.635 --> 09:13.845
[door opens]

09:15.055 --> 09:18.433
You're not gonna believe this.
I just screamed in there.

09:19.017 --> 09:22.979
-Uh…
-Yeah, we, um… we-- we-- we heard you.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.481
Are you sure it was me?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.399
-Yeah. Pretty certain.
-[phone rings]

09:27.233 --> 09:29.527
Yo! Oh, no, we're fine.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.197
Nah, it's just my gal screaming.
[sniffs] Yeah, you bet.

09:32.947 --> 09:36.367
Hey, guys.
I don't mean to pry or anything,

09:36.451 --> 09:39.829
but are you guys, like,
secret billionaires or something?

09:39.913 --> 09:42.165
-Why do you ask?
-'Cause this place looks very expensive.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.918
Oh, super expensive. We spent, like,
every penny we had on this place.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.002
Yeah.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.253
Wait. Why would you do that?

09:47.337 --> 09:49.923
[man] My buddy Charlie came here
way back when and raved about it.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.717
If we're gonna go on vacation,
might as well go all out, right?

09:52.801 --> 09:54.427
And just go broke?

09:54.511 --> 09:55.720
Oh, we'll make more money.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.807
I work in a doctor's office.
Ron here is a park ranger.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.142
And not to brag, we're pretty good.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.978
Kyla and I always say
if we find ourselves with too much money,

10:04.062 --> 10:05.939
we haven't been spending it fast enough.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.482
That-- That's one way to live.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.484
You know, they say
money buys you freedom,

10:09.567 --> 10:12.278
but how can you really be free if you're
thinking about making money all the
time?

10:12.362 --> 10:15.740
Well, I guess it's your welfare checks
I've been paying. [chuckles]

10:15.824 --> 10:17.951
Possibly. Possibly, Marcus.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.162
-[chuckling] Anyway, to the happy couple.
-[Kyla] To the happy, gorgeous couple!

10:21.246 --> 10:22.747
-All right.
-[Kyla] Yeah, you're engaged!

10:22.831 --> 10:23.706
[giggles]

10:24.582 --> 10:25.583
-[slurping]
-Oh, that is good.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.336
Ron makes the best margaritas,
and let me just tell you, girl.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.754
-Babe.
-It gets the job done.

10:29.838 --> 10:30.755
[Ron] Indeed.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.549
So, Ron. What park do you work at?

10:32.632 --> 10:35.301
Oh. Oregon National Cave Monument.
It's in Oregon.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.928
Whoa. You work in caves?

10:37.011 --> 10:40.306
I'm like Batman. If Batman's job was
to keep kids from jacking off stalagmites.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.307
[Kyla] Totally.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.475
What about you guys?

10:42.559 --> 10:44.352
Uh, we're from Chicago, actually.

10:44.435 --> 10:47.480
I work in finance and Marcus owns
his own construction company.

10:47.564 --> 10:51.609
Quick question.
Um, why does the salt not taste salty?

10:51.693 --> 10:53.570
-Oh, because it's cocaine.
-What?

10:54.696 --> 10:56.614
-You drugged us?
-[Ron, Kyla] Yeah.

10:56.698 --> 10:59.450
I thought I made it really clear
when I said to her-- I was like, you know,

10:59.534 --> 11:01.411
-"It'll get the job done."
-"It gets the job done."

11:01.494 --> 11:04.831
Get the job done? That's not clear.
That's very vague, okay?

11:04.914 --> 11:08.459
What is wrong with you?
Why would you put cocaine in
margaritas?

11:09.210 --> 11:11.462
Because we're on vacation.

11:11.546 --> 11:12.714
I don't do drugs.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.634
-Even on vacation?
-No.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.806
[both laughing]

11:21.890 --> 11:23.349
-[Ron] He almost had me!
-[Kyla] Oh, my God.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.894
-He almost-- [laughs]
-It's so good!

11:25.977 --> 11:28.897
-You! Oh, man! This is-- This guy!
-Oh, my God. I just--

11:28.980 --> 11:30.523
It would have been nice
if you would've told us

11:30.607 --> 11:32.358
that you was gonna put cocaine
in our drink.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.818
Where'd you get the coke from, anyway?

11:33.902 --> 11:36.779
We actually brought it from home.
Very, very easy if you ever wanna try it.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.615
It's just a Ziploc
in a full shampoo bottle.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.909
The scanners can't see it,
dogs can't smell it,

11:40.992 --> 11:43.494
and it's so much more comfortable
than when I had it in my ass.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.579
You guys want nibbles?

11:44.662 --> 11:46.039
-Mmm.
-[cell phone vibrates]

11:46.122 --> 11:47.248
Oh.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.333
Wait a minute.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.918
[sighs] What now, baby?

11:49.959 --> 11:53.087
Whale watching. I forgot
I booked a whale watching tour at 4:30.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.464
What? You guys just got here.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.257
Marcus likes to plan.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.843
You know what? Good for you.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.638
'Cause without a plan,
the world falls apart.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.348
I mean, garbage doesn't get collected.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.142
Water slides don't get built.
Planes fall from the sky.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.311
Planning makes the world work.

12:08.895 --> 12:12.649
Yeah, it's just, uh… just whale watching.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.984
Wait. I have an idea.
We were actually gonna go to the water.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.904
We can walk you guys down, all chat and
get to know each other a little bit more.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.031
-What do you say?
-All right. Let's go get changed.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.199
[Kyla] Yay!

12:21.282 --> 12:23.201
I love your whole everything, by the way.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.662
-[man chanting]
-[baby crying]

12:27.330 --> 12:28.915
They said this was exclusive.

12:29.916 --> 12:33.044
"An exclusive, luxury experience."
That's what the website said.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.796
This is really gonna bum out the whales.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.381
[Kyla] Baby, this is so gross.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.841
I won't be able to sleep at night
if I know they've gone on this boat.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.094
You guys,
you should just come with us in our boat.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.513
-[Ron] That's a great idea.
-Wait a minute. That boat is yours?

12:43.596 --> 12:46.432
As long as we're staying here it is.
We rented it. What do you say? Our treat.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.644
-I mean, I'm down if you're down.
-[Kyla gasps]

12:49.727 --> 12:51.104
-Yay!
-[chuckling] Oh.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.563
[laughs] Could you give us a second?

12:52.647 --> 12:54.983
-Gonna talk to my lady really quick.
-No problem. Not a problem.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.192
-Be right back.
-See you in a bit.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.443
-Baby.
-Yeah, babe?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.863
How is someone already throwing up?

13:00.947 --> 13:03.574
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is not weird to you?

13:03.658 --> 13:05.034
-I mean--
-Don't look. They're not weird?

13:05.118 --> 13:09.330
They're the only people I've ever heard of
to smuggle drugs into Mexico.

13:09.414 --> 13:12.959
-I don't know, baby. Screw it.
-What?

13:13.042 --> 13:15.169
Can we for once, just in our lives,

13:15.253 --> 13:18.965
just say "screw it" to all the plans
and just get on a damn boat?

13:19.465 --> 13:23.011
Look at it. It's kind of amazing.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.179
[scoffs]

13:25.263 --> 13:27.890
Look. The only reason I'm gonna do this
is 'cause I love you.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.017
Mm-hmm.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.601
And it's because you my fiancée now.

13:30.685 --> 13:31.936
-Fiancée?
-Yeah.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.022
-Well, I like the sound of that.
-Yeah.

13:34.105 --> 13:34.939
Mmm.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.400
-We do too.
-Jesus!

13:37.483 --> 13:39.277
-Fiancée.
-[chuckles]

13:39.360 --> 13:42.196
Look, thanks for the offer, okay?
We're-- We're in.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.574

-Yay! Guys--

13:49.579 --> 13:53.166
Goddamn, sailing makes my dick hard.
I'm almost at half-mast.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.585
Okay, man. Where did you learn
to sail a boat like this?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.337
[Ron] I did cleanup work
off Malaysia one summer.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.505
Learn all kinds of stuff
when you're at sea.

13:59.589 --> 14:03.092
Look at that bird. You know I can tell
from here that bird's about to shit.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.261
Watch.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.347
[squawks]

14:08.806 --> 14:09.640
Ugh.

14:10.933 --> 14:14.520
What type of skill set do you gotta have
just to predict when a bird gonna shit?

14:15.521 --> 14:16.814
It's weird, but it's impressive.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.149
I'll take it.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.151
So, you said you were a nurse, right?

14:20.234 --> 14:21.736
No. [laughs]

14:21.819 --> 14:26.532
I am more of, like,
an assistant to Dr. Adolphus.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.701
-Interesting name.
-I know, right?

14:28.785 --> 14:30.578
He's had to change it, like,
a million times

14:30.661 --> 14:32.622
because the Feds are always after him.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.458
But what can I say?
The benefits are really worth it.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.587
-Like what? Good insurance?
-[chuckles]

14:39.670 --> 14:42.048
-Free pills.
-[chuckles]

14:42.131 --> 14:43.883
Hey, Marcus. Want to take her for a spin?

14:43.966 --> 14:47.095
No, I don't-- I don't--
I don't drive boats. I don't sail.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.597
Then who's gonna drive the boat?
'Cause I'm not driving.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.225
-There's no one driving the boat.
-Man, are you out your fucking mind?

14:52.308 --> 14:54.310
-Hey, man! What's wrong with you?
-Look at you.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.187
-Look at me do what?
-You're driving the boat.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.522
-Who's driving the boat?
-You are.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.357
-I'm driving the boat?
-Scoot over. Scoot over.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.025
Here.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.610
Hands off.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.612
[chuckling] Whoa.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.489
That's a lot smoother
than I thought it was gonna be.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.657
Yeah, man, relax.

We have different hair.

No, it's all good.
I can still feel the wind…

You want one? I'm pouring.

-Chilled or straight up?
-Yeah, I'll take a tequila.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.771
Nice. Just, uh,
keep an eye out for the rocks.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.023
Yeah, I'll take it on the rocks too.
Thank you.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.944
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna have it chilled
and on the rocks.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.946
It's gonna be extra cold. [laughs]

for crashing your boat?

Come on. Nobody's dead, right?

19:15.446 --> 19:19.492
[Emily] It is going to be real hard
to go back to the real world tomorrow.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.494
-I know.
-[groans]

19:21.577 --> 19:23.788
I mean, I'm looking forward to
planning my wedding,

19:23.871 --> 19:25.456
-but it is gonna be a shit show.
-Mmm.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.209
You know, that's exactly why
Ron and I never got hitched.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.504
Oh. I guess-- I guess I just assumed
you guys already were.

19:31.587 --> 19:35.049
No. Spiritually, we've probably been
married six or seven times,

19:35.132 --> 19:37.259
but like "governmentally,"
you know, with the license,

19:37.343 --> 19:39.178
we just never really saw the point.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.429
Not even for kids?

19:40.513 --> 19:42.139
Kids aren't in the cards for us.

19:42.223 --> 19:46.852
I mean, we'd obviously be incredible
parents, but it's not gonna happen.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.355
[laughing]

19:49.438 --> 19:51.023
Would you look at those two?

19:51.107 --> 19:56.070
I mean, 'cause I have never seen Marcus
this relaxed. [chuckles] It's amazing.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.280
-[whispers] Emily.
-What?

19:59.615 --> 20:01.158
I'm Ron's prisoner.

20:01.909 --> 20:02.952
What are you talking about?

20:03.035 --> 20:06.038
I've been trying to find the time to get
you alone, but I haven't been able to.

20:06.122 --> 20:09.125
Emily, he abducted me from a shopping
mall when I was 12.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.711
Okay? He's completely
crazy. He has a gun.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.129
-A gun?
-Yeah. Shh.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.549
He's-- He's made me live in a basement.
He's made me eat cat food.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.510
And he makes me go to the bathroom
in a little lawn chair with a hole in it.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.012
-What the hell? Why?
-I need to find a way to get his gun.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.848
-We can't--
-We're not safe!

20:23.931 --> 20:25.933
-What the hell?
-[laughs]

20:26.016 --> 20:28.018
-I got you.
-You were really jok-- You're such--

20:28.102 --> 20:29.937
-You're the worst.
-I just got you.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.064
-[Emily] That was not funny.
-[Kyla] It was really funny.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.400
-I can't believe you…
-Nah, man, I'm sorry. I keep forgetting.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.695
No, you know what?
Fuck it. Come on. Give it to me.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.113
We're having a good time.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.533
[chuckling]

20:42.616 --> 20:44.285
Yeah. [chuckles]

20:45.202 --> 20:46.620
[sighs]

20:46.704 --> 20:50.541
You know, when we first saw y'all
on this trip, we thought y'all was crazy.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.628
I mean, I was right.
I mean, y'all are, like, fucking nuts.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.964
-[chuckles]
-But-- But in a good way, man.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.300
I'm glad I met you, Ron.

21:00.926 --> 21:01.927
Like for real.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.431
Put that thing away.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.434
Put what away? What are we doing?

21:10.144 --> 21:11.145
<i>Salaam.</i>

21:14.398 --> 21:16.859
A kiss on the forehead is
the ultimate sign of respect.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.444
I learned that from a sheikh in Kuwait.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.696
A forehead kiss is really intimate.
You know that, right?

21:20.780 --> 21:21.989
Like, I almost proposed to you.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.450
-[laughs]
-[chuckles]

21:25.409 --> 21:27.453
-Nice.
-Mmm.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.748
-Where should I get rid of this then?
-I'll show you.

21:30.831 --> 21:34.043
Hey, ladies. Come here. Check this out.

21:35.252 --> 21:38.631
-Oh, shit, man. What the fuck?
-Oh, my God. He really does have a gun.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.717
Yeah, babe. I wouldn't lie about that.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.512
It's a gift from my buddy Charlie.
I take it everywhere.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.764
Man,
you scared the shit out of me with that.

21:46.847 --> 21:47.848
What does this mean?

21:47.932 --> 21:49.683
[Ron] <i>De oppresso liber.</i>

21:49.767 --> 21:52.770
It's a phrase that has special meaning
to people such as myself, Marcus.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.939
A reminder
that a powerful weapon like this

21:55.022 --> 21:57.149
should only be used
when absolutely necessary.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.655
Now, put that bottle on your head.
I'm gonna shoot it off.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.032
-Yes! [grunts]
-Whoo!

22:05.115 --> 22:08.202
No. Hold on one second. Hold on a
second. Guys, no. Seriously, stop playing.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.287
It's fine.
We play this game at home all the time.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.581
Babe, he's not serious.
We been drinking and we been smoking.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.667
-I don't-- No, no, no.
-[screams]

22:14.750 --> 22:15.835
Count it!

22:16.544 --> 22:19.380
What the fuck?

22:19.463 --> 22:20.631
You hit the bottle this time!

22:21.590 --> 22:23.050
-[laughs]
-Oh, my God.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.637
[laughing hysterically]

22:27.763 --> 22:29.974
[chuckles] Yes!

22:30.057 --> 22:33.561
[both laughing]

22:33.644 --> 22:35.187
Oh, my God!

22:35.688 --> 22:37.398
-Do me!
-Whoa, wait, what?

22:37.481 --> 22:38.482
Yeah. Your turn, go.

22:40.568 --> 22:41.569
[laughs]

22:42.486 --> 22:44.029
[Marcus] Hey, man, you sure you okay?

22:44.113 --> 22:47.449
[Ron] The bullet just grazed me. I'm not
gonna let a little scratch ruin my night.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.327
I mean, look at the four of us.
This is magical, isn't it?

22:50.411 --> 22:51.453
Mmm.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.289
You know what's crazy, you guys?

22:53.998 --> 22:58.377
Ron and I are the only two people on the
planet that know that y'all are engaged.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.254
Ah, I wish it could stay that way.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.089
I mean, to be honest,

23:02.172 --> 23:04.717
there's a lot of people
that really wouldn't be happy for us.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.801
[together] What?

23:06.302 --> 23:08.262
-Who?
-Look, her dad hates me, y'all. For real.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.472
-[Emily] Okay, not hates.
-What?

23:10.556 --> 23:13.684
He just don't think I'm good enough
to marry his perfect-ass daughter.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.811
-[Emily] Perfect da-- Who? Me?
-[Marcus] Yes, you.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.147
Okay, listen, no.
My dad's a little tough, yes.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.525
I mean, he is the dean
of Emory Business School,

23:21.609 --> 23:23.402
so he's a little traditional.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.779
I literally don't understand
what you're saying right now.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.406
This is Marcus we're talking about!

23:27.489 --> 23:32.119
I know. It's insane! How could anyone
not, like, absolutely love you?

23:32.202 --> 23:33.037
You're the best.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.622
[Marcus] Her father holds
all these things against me.

23:34.705 --> 23:36.165
Like, number one, you know,

23:36.248 --> 23:39.126
he looks down on me because
I had a failed marriage before, right?

23:39.209 --> 23:41.170
Things don't work out. It is what it is.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.590
Number two, he treats me like
I'm some regular construction worker.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.384
I own my own construction company.
I'm my own boss.

23:47.468 --> 23:48.802
This doesn't seem justified.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.763
Yeah, but strike three, I'ma be honest.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.057
I did punch her brother in the face
at her mama's birthday party.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.141
-Got it.
-There's that.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.977
Well, my dad never got to meet Ron.

23:57.061 --> 23:58.354
Oh, no!

23:58.437 --> 23:59.605
Sorry, did he die?

23:59.688 --> 24:01.732
No. San Quentin's just so far.

24:01.815 --> 24:04.568
I got it. Wait, I got it.
I got it. I freaking got it.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.487
-What?
-Do it tonight.

24:06.570 --> 24:07.780
-[Kyla gasps]
-Wait. Do what tonight?

24:07.863 --> 24:10.032
-Get married tonight! Here!
-Get married! Tonight!

24:10.115 --> 24:11.533
Yes! Right! Tonight, you guys!

24:11.617 --> 24:13.285
Wait, why would we do that?

24:13.369 --> 24:14.912
[Ron] You said
your family wouldn't approve.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.289
You'll be surrounded by friends
that love and support you.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.041
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-Friends!

24:19.124 --> 24:20.292
It's a wedding just for you guys.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.795
[Ron] Come on. I know the perfect guy.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.881
[chanting in Mayan]

24:28.300 --> 24:30.135
Baby. Baby,
do you think this is legally binding?

24:30.219 --> 24:33.347
Somehow I don't think so.
But just go with it.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.015
[whispering] You did good, babe.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.351
We did good.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.019
[speaks Mayan]

24:39.103 --> 24:41.063
He's asking if you brought your <i>suku'un</i>.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.064
Wh-What's that?

24:42.147 --> 24:44.149
In Mayan ritual,
<i>suku'un</i> is like your brother.

24:45.025 --> 24:47.778
-Like a spiritual best man.
-Mm-hmm.

24:48.988 --> 24:52.324
Well, I guess you my <i>s-- su-suk--</i>
<i>suku'un</i>? Is that how you say it?

24:52.408 --> 24:56.036
Marcus.
You don't say that if you don't mean it.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.497
I-I-I do mean it.

24:58.580 --> 25:02.001
And, uh, you don't have to be
so intense about it. Just chill out.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.211
[gasps] Wow!

25:06.088 --> 25:07.089
[Kyla sighs]

25:08.757 --> 25:12.845
[chanting continues]

25:12.928 --> 25:14.680
[whispering] I have goose bumps.

25:31.864 --> 25:32.865
[cell phone chimes]

25:33.866 --> 25:36.952
Well, looks like you fuckers are married!

25:37.036 --> 25:39.538
[Ron laughs] Yes! Congratulations!

25:39.621 --> 25:41.999
-We did it! You love me!
-We love you guys!

25:42.082 --> 25:43.792
-I love you.
-We love you guys!

25:44.251 --> 25:45.878
Hey. Yo, yo. [speaks Mayan]

25:49.173 --> 25:52.551
-Yes! Yes! Congratulations!
-Whoo!

25:52.634 --> 25:53.802
[Emily] We did it!

25:53.886 --> 25:55.220
[Kyla] Congrats, you guys!

25:58.098 --> 26:02.061
[Kyla] Ah! Oh, my God. Whoo!

26:02.144 --> 26:03.562
Oh, it's so pretty.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.106
Listen up, world.

26:06.190 --> 26:10.110
Allow me to introduce to you,
for the first time in sacred matrimony,

26:10.194 --> 26:11.904
Marcus and Emily Parker!

26:11.987 --> 26:13.072
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

26:13.155 --> 26:17.743
May this be the worst day
of the rest of your fucking life!

26:18.452 --> 26:19.453
What?

26:19.953 --> 26:21.163
Think about it.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.416
[panting]

26:24.500 --> 26:27.169
Whoa. Wha-- What are you doin'?

26:27.753 --> 26:29.088
Covering my balls.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.130
[laughing] This guy.

26:31.423 --> 26:37.137
You know what, Marcus?
You're right. It's time to live.

26:37.221 --> 26:38.555
-[Emily] What?
-[Ron grunts]

26:38.639 --> 26:39.807

26:44.520 --> 26:45.729
He's alive.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.022
What?

26:47.106 --> 26:52.653
[Ron] That was incredible!
But, Marcus, do cover your balls!

26:53.278 --> 26:55.489
-I'll do it if you do it.
-Oh, girl, hell no!

26:55.572 --> 26:56.615

27:12.256 --> 27:14.591
I'm not doing that shit. [chuckles]

27:18.178 --> 27:19.179
You know something?

27:19.263 --> 27:20.347

27:20.931 --> 27:23.350

-Whoo!
-[Marcus laughs] What are you--

27:49.168 --> 27:51.378
[laughing] He's using a corkscrew
on a regular bottle.

27:51.461 --> 27:55.132
That's not a wine bottle, man.
That's not even a cork!

27:55.215 --> 27:56.675
-[laughs]
-Whoa!

29:42.281 --> 29:43.115
I don't know.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.659
-Okay. We're so close.
-[man on PA, indistinct]

29:45.742 --> 29:47.077
[pants, sighs]

29:47.160 --> 29:48.370
[Ron] Hey! Stop that couple!

29:48.453 --> 29:49.955
[Kyla] I think they have a bomb!

29:50.038 --> 29:52.082
[both laughing]

29:52.165 --> 29:53.375
What-- No. No, no, no.

29:55.669 --> 29:57.129
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

29:57.212 --> 30:00.048
What is wrong with y'all?
Are you crazy? We in an airport!

30:00.132 --> 30:03.510
No, I will not mule your illegal drugs
in my anus!

30:03.593 --> 30:04.594
-[laughs]
-What?

30:05.304 --> 30:07.014
Look around. Nobody cares.

30:07.097 --> 30:10.392
And you guys were so cute and peaceful
this morning. We didn't wanna wake you
up.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.810
Hair of the dog?

30:11.893 --> 30:13.812
Oh, I can't even look at another drink.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.732
Sit. Come on. We got shrimp nachos
coming. Leave the heads on down here.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.859
-Oh, God.
-Come on. Sit, please.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.027
[Marcus] Okay, you know something?

30:20.110 --> 30:22.404
-We gonna just head to the gate.
-We gonna go. Yeah.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.489
-No! Whoa, whoa.
-No, no, no. Whoa, whoa.

30:24.573 --> 30:28.035
Guys. We gotta do this again. The four
of us are too good together not to!

30:28.118 --> 30:31.580
Yes! Oh, my God. You guys should come
out for the Oregon State Fair next month!

30:31.663 --> 30:35.459
Yeah! It's in Oregon. We go every year.
Last year, we took a double dose of DMT.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.586
Yeah, don't worry. It's all natural.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.088
It's just the chemical your brain releases
when you die.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.798
-[Marcus] Oh, yeah.
-Okay.

30:41.882 --> 30:42.799
Sounds fun.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.384
Great. Give us your number.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.597
Oh, wait-- Baby, you go--
You got my phone?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.098
[Marcus] 'Cause I didn't--

30:50.182 --> 30:51.016
Your phone broke.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.601
-Her phone broke and then my--
-Oh, my God.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.270
I had a phone, but we'll take
your information. How about that?

30:55.354 --> 30:56.980
-Oh, my God. Yes! Yes.
-Yeah! Of course.

30:57.064 --> 30:58.315
-Baby. Give them your card.
-I got one.

30:58.398 --> 30:59.941
He has very fancy business cards.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.151
-[Ron] Yeah. There you go!
-[Emily] Wow.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.403
So, when you call that,
that's gonna ring in the ranger's station.

31:03.487 --> 31:04.988
Then somebody comes to get me
outta the cave.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.324
Oh, before I forget,
let me give your sunglasses back.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.742
No, man. Keep 'em.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.578
Why you want me to keep 'em?
They're yours.

31:11.661 --> 31:12.913
No, they're ours.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.206
[shaman chanting]

31:14.289 --> 31:17.834
You guys are in our lives now.
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

31:17.918 --> 31:19.211
[Marcus] Yeah. You know--

31:19.294 --> 31:21.880
It would be nice if, you know,
you keep what--

31:21.963 --> 31:25.425
what happened here… here.

31:25.509 --> 31:26.510
Marcus,

31:26.593 --> 31:29.596
if you're worried about the catamaran,
don't worry about it. I got you, dude.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.432
Care about the boat? I'm talking about
everything-- I'm talkin' about all of it.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.935
Are you kidding?
I'm gonna remember this week forever.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.103
[Marcus] What? Oh.

31:37.062 --> 31:40.857
It's been so special.
I love, love, love, love, love, love you.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.614
-Bring it in.
-Oh. Mmm.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.032
Get in here.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.244
-Okay. [chuckles]
-[Kyla] Oh.

31:52.327 --> 31:55.914
Marcus. Thank you so much
for being so cool about everything.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.500
About what?

31:59.042 --> 32:00.252
Last night.

32:01.920 --> 32:06.675
Marcus, it was life-changing.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.806
Okay. Baby, we should go. [chuckles]
Farewell. Take care.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.349
-[Kyla] Oh, no.
-Let's go.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.143
-[chuckles]
-See you guys later.

32:16.226 --> 32:18.854
-[Kyla] We love you guys.
-Hey, somebody stop those two!

32:18.937 --> 32:22.190
I think I see some human trafficking!
[chuckles]

32:22.274 --> 32:25.360
Hey. Why did you say see you later?
That leaves the door open.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.654
I don't know. I was trying to be vague.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.615
And who says "farewell"?
What are you? Othello?

32:30.699 --> 32:33.034
Farewell sounds final, okay?

32:33.118 --> 32:35.036
I don't wanna see those freaks again.
Do you?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.913
I don't know. They were kinda fun.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.207
Yes, on vacation. Not in the real world.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.835
But they did loosen us up a little bit.

32:41.918 --> 32:44.671
Yes,
they may have loosened us up a little bit,

32:44.754 --> 32:46.214
but speaking of gettin' loose.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.259
Do you remember anything
that happened last night?

32:51.595 --> 32:54.723
Mm-mmm.
After the ceremony, it was all a blur.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.851
But-- But was it
that type of blur that, um--

32:57.934 --> 33:01.188
That some moments are, like--
like, insanely clear?

33:01.271 --> 33:02.564
[Emily] Hmm.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.150
You know, now that you mention it.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.154
No, all a blur.

33:11.031 --> 33:15.285
Oh. Well, it was a--
It's all a blur for me too. [chuckles]

33:15.368 --> 33:17.579
There's nothing clearly I remember at all.

33:17.662 --> 33:18.914
[chuckles]

33:18.997 --> 33:20.165
'Cause I'm asking you.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.877
Maybe it's for the best.
You got your ticket out? We're boarding.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.551
[woman on PA, indistinct]

33:36.890 --> 33:38.517
-[whirring]
-[truck beeping]

33:40.477 --> 33:42.687
Now, look. Whenever we off-load
materials on the site,

33:42.771 --> 33:45.148
what we do is, we log on here
and put it on this spreadsheet.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.108
This is the way we keep tabs
with the inventory.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.819
Yeah, but why can't we just write it
in the book like we used to?

33:49.903 --> 33:52.822
The problem is, I can't log on to a book
when I'm in Atlanta, right?

33:52.906 --> 33:55.492
I need to be on the cloud
so I can see what you clowns are doing.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.160
It's almost like you don't trust us.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.704
It's almost like
I don't trust y'all anymore? [chuckles]

33:59.788 --> 34:01.998
Guess what?
I do trust y'all, to screw shit up.

34:02.082 --> 34:03.667
That's why I'm only gone for a week.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.627
Oh, I can fuck a lot of shit up in a week.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.170
I 100% believe that. You s--

34:07.254 --> 34:09.548
Yo, Marcus.
Fred and Enzo are fighting again.

34:09.631 --> 34:11.174
What? [groans] Damn it.

34:12.008 --> 34:14.511
-Let's go. Hands up. Let's go.
-You think I'm scared of you, bro?

34:14.594 --> 34:17.681
I ain't scared of you. Think I'm playing
with you? I ain't playing with you.

34:17.764 --> 34:18.598
Cut it out!

34:18.682 --> 34:20.600
Stop it! Okay, what is this all about?

34:20.684 --> 34:21.726
He's trying to steal my shit.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.353
Fuck you. I had this crane booked.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.063
You should have logged it
in the spreadsheet.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.190
You just learned
about spreadsheets, okay? Chill.

34:27.274 --> 34:30.151
Why y'all arguing about a damn crane?
One of y'all could use the sidelifter.

34:30.235 --> 34:31.236
This one's special.

34:33.488 --> 34:35.282
[Marcus] What you mean this one is--

34:35.365 --> 34:37.033
[laughing]

34:37.117 --> 34:38.785
You gotta be kiddin' me. Come on, now.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.287
It's a Hugo Boss.

34:40.370 --> 34:43.999
We were thinking Vera Wang, but decided
this one's better for your build.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.000
Hey, man.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.418
Wow, look at this.

34:46.501 --> 34:47.836
Yo, this is dope, man.

34:47.919 --> 34:50.714
Like, honestly, thank y'all.
I really appreciate this.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.466
And look, y'all-- Y'all do understand why
you can't come to the wedding, right?

34:53.550 --> 34:55.802
Yeah. You're embarrassed by us.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.555
-No. Have you met her parents?
-No, because you won't let us.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.140
Okay, look, if it was up to me,

35:00.223 --> 35:03.018
I would invite every last one of y'all
to the wedding, but I can't.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.728
Her parents said
they just want family there.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.354
They want it to be really intimate.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.482
[big band music playing]

35:09.566 --> 35:11.026
[Marcus] Baby, what is this?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.194
What happened to intimate?
Who's all these people?

35:13.778 --> 35:17.407
As far as I'm concerned,
we got married in a Mexican cave.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.618
So if you wanna bail, I'm down.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.745
Really? We can-- We can do that?

35:21.828 --> 35:23.496
Mm-mmm. No, we can't.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.541
[music ends]

35:26.625 --> 35:28.668
[chattering]

35:28.752 --> 35:31.046
Oh, there they are.

35:31.129 --> 35:34.507
Marcus,
I am so glad that you're finally here.

35:34.591 --> 35:35.967
Hey. Good seeing you too. [chuckles]

35:36.051 --> 35:39.346
And look at my girl. [chuckles] Oh.

35:39.429 --> 35:41.765
Please tell me
that you brought the dress I sent you.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.517
You only texted me about it
a million times. Yes, Mom, I did.

35:44.601 --> 35:45.477
-Oh, good.
-[Emily] Yes.

35:45.560 --> 35:49.439
Well, I want you all to remember
that this weekend is all about you.

35:49.522 --> 35:52.150
So I want you to have fun.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.693
Enjoy yourselves.

35:53.777 --> 35:56.404
Just remember to work the room
while everyone's here

35:56.488 --> 35:58.365
starting with Grandma Phyllis.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.368
[footsteps departing]

36:02.994 --> 36:06.206
Baby, is she sleeping with her eyes open?

36:07.332 --> 36:08.166
[Emily] Grandma.

36:08.792 --> 36:09.751
Grandma.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.795
-[whispering] Grandma.
-[wheezes]

36:11.878 --> 36:15.256
Oh, Emily. Is that you?

36:15.340 --> 36:16.633
Yeah, Grandma.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.051
Marcus, say hi.

36:19.636 --> 36:20.470
[loudly] Hi.

36:20.553 --> 36:23.556
Okay. Hey, Grandma,
why don't I go get you some tea?

36:24.307 --> 36:25.767
I'm-- I'm her fiancé, Marcus.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.268
[Emily] She's not deaf, Marcus.

36:27.352 --> 36:30.146
She didn't wake up.
You said her name five times. I don't--

36:31.731 --> 36:33.942
-[woman] Hey, girl.
-[man] Oh, my princess.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.735
-Oh.
-Hey.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.112
-[man] How are you?
-[Emily] I'm good.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.196
[man] Okay, okay.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.620
Marcus.

36:49.874 --> 36:50.875
Meet my colleagues.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.753
This is Albert Kim.
He's chair of our Public Policy program.

36:53.837 --> 36:57.465
And this is Dr. Gloria Alvarez.
She's head of Business Law.

36:58.216 --> 37:02.429
And this is, uh, Marcus.
He's a construction worker.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.472
It's nice to meet you.

37:06.307 --> 37:10.103
Well, Marcus, uh…
welcome to your wedding.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.772
Thanks for putting everything together.
I really appreciate this.

37:12.856 --> 37:14.524
I just sign the checks.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.109
[chuckles]

37:16.192 --> 37:19.988
[sighs] Well,
I suppose I put this off long enough.

37:22.115 --> 37:26.202
Now, these rings were passed on to me
by my grandparents,

37:26.286 --> 37:31.082
so forgive me for being just
a little uneasy handing them over to…

37:32.667 --> 37:33.626
[sighs]

37:33.710 --> 37:35.295
…well, you.

37:37.172 --> 37:38.423
[Marcus] Wow, this, um--

37:38.506 --> 37:40.008
This actually means a lot.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.719
And you can trust me.
I promise you, I'll take care of these.

37:42.802 --> 37:46.389
I hope so. Those represent a commitment
to my daughter.

37:46.473 --> 37:49.976
And I hope you take this far more
seriously than you did your last marriage.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.896
What makes you think I didn't take
my last marriage seriously?

37:52.979 --> 37:54.898
Damn, son. This some fancy shit.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.735
You done come a long way from drinkin'
40s on the stoop with little Jay and
Reggie.

37:58.818 --> 38:01.446
-Oh, stop. [laughs]
-Hey.

38:01.529 --> 38:05.658
Ooh, I'm so glad to be out that car.
Your father farting the whole way.

38:05.742 --> 38:08.161
[father]
You know I got the diverticulitis.

38:08.244 --> 38:11.915
Anyway, good to see you, Harry.
We brought you a little something.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.041
Oh, thank you.

38:13.124 --> 38:17.212
Yeah, that's not the regular Hennessy.
That's VSOP, $71.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.630
[mother] Yeah, that was a set.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.215
It came with two glasses,

38:20.298 --> 38:23.676
but we kept those 'cause we thought
you had glasses. [laughs]

38:23.760 --> 38:27.472
I think I see the councilman.
I should go say hello.

38:27.555 --> 38:28.640
-Oh. Yeah.
-I like that jacket.

38:28.723 --> 38:29.557
Yeah.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.476
And tell the councilman I say hi too.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.936
[laughing]

38:33.812 --> 38:35.855
Hey! Look, look.
Can y'all class it up a little bit?

38:35.939 --> 38:37.232
-I told you--
-What's your problem?

38:37.315 --> 38:39.359
We're just two men
having a conversation about cognac.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.611
No, I told you to put
the two glasses in there.

38:41.694 --> 38:42.904
-No.
-Hey.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.906
Look here. It's not about the glasses.

38:44.989 --> 38:48.201
You talked about farting.
Nobody care about Dad's gas like that.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.620
And, Dad, you can't tell nobody
how much you spent on the gift.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.330
What's the point in spending
so much money then?

38:52.413 --> 38:55.291
-How about this. Go-- Go get some food.
-[mother] Mmm.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.794
It is so much food over there.
Y'all should go eat.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.420
-Well, let me just say this.
-Uh-oh.

38:59.504 --> 39:04.050
We will not talk to anyone else this
entire weekend if that's what you want.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.885
If that's what you want.
I'm not gonna embarrass you.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.345
-Ma, no.
-[father] See what you gone done?

39:07.428 --> 39:10.181
Believe me. We're not hungry.
We not gonna eat any of your food.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.642
-Ma. I know y'all hungry.
-You done messed up, boy.

39:12.725 --> 39:15.103
-Dad-- Could you talk to her for me?
-No, sir.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.187
Ma-- Ma.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.522
[jazz music playing]

39:17.605 --> 39:20.149
[chattering]

39:20.233 --> 39:22.026
-…not us.
-[laughs]

39:22.110 --> 39:24.654
-[sighs] You ready? Here we go.
-[man] Ladies and gentlemen,

39:24.737 --> 39:31.244
may I please present to you the bride
and groom-to-be, Emily and Marcus!

39:31.327 --> 39:33.663
[applause, cheering]

39:35.790 --> 39:37.166
-Oh, good. Aw.
-You…

39:39.544 --> 39:41.337
How you doing?
Could I get a double scotch, please?

39:41.421 --> 39:43.172
-Of course.
-Hope you didn't order the punch.

39:43.256 --> 39:45.884
Get it? 'Cause you punched me.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.388
[chuckles]

39:50.471 --> 39:52.473
Brother-in-law. Hey, Gabe.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.893
Hey. You see this?

39:54.976 --> 39:58.855
Just know that this thing right here
could kill you in 32 different ways,

39:58.938 --> 40:01.190
and there's not a goddamn thing
you could do about it.

40:01.274 --> 40:04.527
Okay, man. What you-- What?
You been working out or somethin'?

40:04.611 --> 40:05.445
Nope.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.031
Yes. A little--

40:08.114 --> 40:09.115
Whatever. Listen.

40:09.198 --> 40:11.993
Just know that if you come at me
with another sucker punch,

40:12.076 --> 40:13.494
I'ma be ready for it this time.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.705
Gabe… [chuckles]
…I didn't sucker punch you.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.249
You was acting like a crazy person
over a flag football game.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.167
Yeah. Right.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.754
You came in my face,
and you kept saying, "Punch me."

40:22.837 --> 40:25.381
-Yeah, because I didn't think you'd do it.
-Well, I did it, okay?

40:25.465 --> 40:29.844
And I'm sorry. I've apologized to you
a thousand times. Can't we just move on?

40:29.928 --> 40:31.596
-Put the past in the past, right?
-Yes.

40:31.679 --> 40:32.931
-Forget it.
-Forget about it.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.808
Yeah. Just-- Oh, but just in case
you get any ideas, I brought a friend.

40:35.892 --> 40:38.186
He owns a dojo where I train.
His name's Bennett.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.355
Bennett! Come here. Meet this guy.

40:40.438 --> 40:44.317
Oh, shit. There he is.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.402
-Marcus.
-Nice to meet you.

40:47.362 --> 40:49.238
-[Gabe] Yeah.
-Why's he here?

40:49.322 --> 40:52.283
Some people like to have friends
at life-changing events.

40:52.367 --> 40:53.826
-That's it.
-That's it.

40:53.910 --> 40:56.454
You would know if you had any friends.

40:56.537 --> 40:59.248
If you did, my mom and dad wouldn't
have forced me to be your best man.

40:59.332 --> 41:00.959
First of all, I don't like you.

41:01.042 --> 41:03.461
And I don't want you to be my best man
anyway, all right?

41:03.544 --> 41:06.381
I have great friends--
I have amazing friends, all right?

41:06.464 --> 41:08.591
You can't even handle any
of my friends. Okay?

41:10.218 --> 41:13.972
[guests scream, gasp]

41:14.055 --> 41:15.223
[murmuring]

41:15.306 --> 41:16.683
What the hell is that?

41:18.059 --> 41:21.604
[shaman chanting]

41:23.314 --> 41:24.732
Oh, uh…

41:29.445 --> 41:30.738
Don't be alarmed--

41:30.822 --> 41:32.156
-Hey.
-Hi, yeah! Just a thing.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.118
You son of a bitch!
You said we were best friends.

41:35.201 --> 41:39.038
[Kyla] Yeah, the hell? You assholes. How
could you not invite us to your wedding?

41:39.122 --> 41:40.540
That's, like, fucked up!

41:42.875 --> 41:44.669
[both laughing]

41:44.752 --> 41:47.672
-[Kyla] Oh, my God! You look amazing.
-[Ron] Good to see you, man.

41:47.755 --> 41:50.925
-You look so gorgeous. Are you so
excited? -You been working out? Look at
you.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.177
-I mean-- And you. You look…
-[Kyla] Oh, my sweetheart!

41:53.261 --> 41:57.056
You guys smell the same. You smell
the same. Oh! I wanna kiss you!

41:57.140 --> 41:58.599
What's-- What's-- What's goin' on here?

41:58.683 --> 42:00.184
-[chuckles]
-Oh, uh…

42:00.268 --> 42:02.061
-We lost the brakes around Marietta.
-Yeah.

42:02.145 --> 42:04.439
E-brake did the yeoman's work till
right about now.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.816
Yo, chief!
Just in case you need to move it.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.776
-[Kyla] Thank you.
-[chuckles]

42:08.860 --> 42:13.865
So, I think what Marcus is trying to ask
is what-- What are you two doing here?

42:13.948 --> 42:18.036
Oh! Well, you guys, we were so confused
why you didn't call after <i>México</i>.

42:18.119 --> 42:19.120
I mean, come on.

42:19.203 --> 42:22.498
We were literally sitting by the phone
for a week being like, "What?" [chuckles]

42:22.582 --> 42:26.002
But it was my bad.
'Cause the card I gave you. Old card.

42:26.085 --> 42:28.504
-You had no way to call.
-[Kyla] We did a little Internet stalking.

42:28.588 --> 42:32.341
Then we found out you guys were
registered at Williams-Sonoma in
beautiful Atlanta.

42:32.425 --> 42:33.426
From there, it was easy.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.636
Hit every wedding in Atlanta,
starting with downtown,

42:35.720 --> 42:37.305
working our way out in concentric circles.

42:37.388 --> 42:40.683
Classic circle sweep maneuver. Same
thing I use to find lost kids in the cave.

42:40.767 --> 42:42.477
This time you weren't too late, sweetie.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.146
Hey, man. Get me up to speed.
What do you need from your best man?

42:45.229 --> 42:46.189
[Kyla] Yay!

42:46.272 --> 42:47.440
Best-- Best man?

42:47.523 --> 42:50.443
Yeah. I mean, remember the shaman?

42:51.277 --> 42:52.111
I'm your <i>suku'un</i>.

42:54.030 --> 42:55.031
Ah!

42:55.114 --> 42:57.033
I do remember that, and, you know,

42:57.700 --> 42:59.118
and I couldn't--

42:59.202 --> 43:00.536
Because we couldn't reach you.

43:00.620 --> 43:01.913
[Marcus] We couldn't reach you.
I couldn't call you.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.873
-We were trying, but I was like…
-We were try-- We tried.

43:03.956 --> 43:06.209
…"If you'd like to make a call…"
Like, I'm trying to!

43:06.292 --> 43:08.544
-Wow, okay.
-So I had to get another best man.

43:08.628 --> 43:09.545
-[sighs] Yeah.
-Sorry.

43:09.629 --> 43:11.464
-What?
-What?

43:11.547 --> 43:12.965
-Who?
-My brother.

43:13.049 --> 43:14.217
-Yeah.
-Her-- her brother.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.469
They are practically best friends.
Like, he loves him.

43:16.552 --> 43:19.180
And, you know,
we decided to do family-style.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.182
-Family. Keep it in the fam. [chuckles]
-[Emily] Mm-hmm. So…

43:21.265 --> 43:25.686
Two <i>suku'uns</i>.
I'll consult the sacred text. [mumbles]

43:25.770 --> 43:27.313
-Okay, look. Look, I get it, right?
-[Emily sighs]

43:27.396 --> 43:30.399
You guys came all the way here,
and, you know, it took a long trip,

43:30.483 --> 43:33.486
and you-- you drove through a gate,
which is crazy, right?

43:33.569 --> 43:36.531
'Cause who gonna pay for that? Who?
'Cause that's not in the insurance.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.408
But that's besides the point.
The wedding is all full, man.

43:39.492 --> 43:41.077
It ain't-- it ain't no more room.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.121
-Nope. No. Like--
-And ain't nowhere to stay.

43:43.204 --> 43:46.374
Oh, who cares? We'll shack up
with you guys, Mexico-style!

43:46.457 --> 43:48.126
Come on, you guys. Have you met us?

43:48.209 --> 43:50.670
We're so quiet.
Honestly, if we were sharing the same
room

43:50.753 --> 43:53.422
and you guys were doing
your little freaky, sexual… [babbles]

43:53.506 --> 43:55.216
…fuckfest post-nups--

43:55.299 --> 43:57.385
-Excuse me.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

43:57.468 --> 43:58.678
Is that your truck?

43:59.345 --> 44:01.472
I'm sorry. This is a private event.

44:01.556 --> 44:04.725
It's cool. We know the bride and groom.
And you are?

44:05.309 --> 44:06.435
I'm Harold Conway.

44:06.519 --> 44:07.645
That's my father.

44:07.728 --> 44:09.230
Oh, my gosh! Shut up.

44:09.313 --> 44:12.817
You're such a cutie. I feel like
I'm meeting a literal celebrity.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.819
Hi. [chuckles] Okay!

44:14.902 --> 44:16.112
He's icy.

44:16.195 --> 44:19.866
I'm Ron. This is Kyla.
Met these two animals down in Mexico.

44:19.949 --> 44:22.785
Got to know each other.
Intimately. [chuckles]

44:22.869 --> 44:24.370
He didn't mean intimately. He meant…

44:24.453 --> 44:26.747
Are you wearing a military dress uniform?

44:26.831 --> 44:29.834
Oh. The buttons! [chuckles]
The buttons gave it away.

44:29.917 --> 44:32.086
And you are aware
that it's a federal offense

44:32.170 --> 44:34.172
to impersonate a member
of the US military?

44:34.255 --> 44:36.257
-Yes, I am.
-Then why are you wearing it?

44:39.552 --> 44:43.389
It's mine. I was in the Army.
I was a Green Beret.

44:43.472 --> 44:44.932
[Harold] Green Beret?

44:45.850 --> 44:46.851
Coin check.

44:51.314 --> 44:53.274
I haven't been coin checked in forever.

44:58.571 --> 45:00.114
[chuckling] I'll be damned.

45:01.115 --> 45:02.992
[chuckling] No way! What?

45:03.868 --> 45:06.579
[Harold] What a treat. [laughs]

45:06.662 --> 45:09.498
-Please, come on and join us.
-Okay. Wait. Harold, they can't stay.

45:09.582 --> 45:11.000
-Right?
-Daddy, that's what you told us.

45:11.083 --> 45:12.043
It's all full, right?

45:12.668 --> 45:14.879
We Green Berets always have
each other's back.

45:14.962 --> 45:15.963
Aw, yay!

45:16.047 --> 45:18.049
-Where did you serve, son?
-Four years in Saudi.

45:18.132 --> 45:19.550
Well, I was five in Laos.

45:19.634 --> 45:21.761
No shit.
Heard you guys had to put jimmy hats

45:21.844 --> 45:23.596
-on the barrels of your M16s!
-Oh, my God, man.

45:23.679 --> 45:26.015
They were so jam prone, we had to.
We didn't have the…

45:26.599 --> 45:30.144
How in the hell did they let that maniac
in the military?

45:30.228 --> 45:32.146
He's the most irresponsible person
I've ever met.

45:32.230 --> 45:33.898
And somehow, he is charming my dad.

45:33.981 --> 45:36.609
And then Charlie says,
"Take your fist out of there!"

45:36.692 --> 45:39.028
This is only happening because you said,
"See you later."

45:39.111 --> 45:41.822
I said it without meaning it,
like any decent person would.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.158
Damn it, look now. Now he did it--
Now he even got to your mama.

45:44.242 --> 45:46.744
-Oh, no, no.
-Look at your mom. She's smiling.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.664
-Oh, shit.
-[shaman chanting]

45:49.747 --> 45:51.749
What if he tells them
about our Mayan wedding?

45:52.667 --> 45:56.212
Oh, no, no, no.
What if he say anything about this trip?

45:56.295 --> 45:57.922
Oh, no.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.758
Okay, look. Okay, we got this.
We just gotta contain it.

46:00.841 --> 46:04.011
[chattering]

46:04.095 --> 46:06.013
Hey, uh, w-where are you guys going?

46:06.097 --> 46:07.890
Oh, I'm gonna show
Ron and Kyla their room.

46:07.974 --> 46:10.309
Wait, Harold.
I thought you said everything was full.

46:10.393 --> 46:13.229
[Harold] Everything was.
Except the Presidential Suite.

46:13.312 --> 46:14.313
So I splurged on it.

46:14.397 --> 46:17.233
-[Kyla] I'm so excited! You're my guy!
-[Harold laughs]

46:17.316 --> 46:19.902
Why wouldn't he do that for us?
We the ones getting married.

46:19.986 --> 46:22.822
Look, if you need anything,
please let me know.

46:22.905 --> 46:25.449
We will.
And… [sighs] …thanks again, Captain.

46:25.533 --> 46:29.245
Also, I hope you join us in the morning.
We have a little fox hunt lined up.

46:29.328 --> 46:32.164
-That's easy. Found her.
-[chuckles]

46:34.959 --> 46:36.252
[Harold] Oh.

46:36.335 --> 46:38.337
Darn it, I must have left the keys
at the front desk.

46:38.421 --> 46:40.214
-Stand down.
-Sir, yes, sir.

46:40.298 --> 46:41.424
[Kyla] Bye. That's so sweet.

46:41.507 --> 46:43.342
-[Emily] Thanks, Dad.
-[Harold] Be right back.

46:43.426 --> 46:47.430
-Okay, look. Um, could you do me a
favor? -Yeah.

46:47.513 --> 46:49.598
'Cause I'm trying to make
a good impression on her family.

46:49.682 --> 46:50.808
-Sure.
-Totally.

46:50.891 --> 46:55.354
It's that you don't mention anything
about the Mexico trip. Nothing.

46:55.438 --> 46:56.772
Nothing at all.

46:56.856 --> 46:58.357
Oh, Marcus. You're so funny.

46:58.441 --> 47:00.943
It's just one catamaran.
It's really not a big deal.

47:01.027 --> 47:02.820
Yeah, it's not about the catamaran. Okay?

47:02.903 --> 47:05.031
It's all the other crazy shit
that happened.

47:05.114 --> 47:08.784
All the insane shit,
it doesn't need to be mentioned here.

47:08.868 --> 47:09.869
At all.

47:09.952 --> 47:11.954
Okay, we got you. We got you.
It's just, um…

47:13.205 --> 47:17.209
Well, the, uh-- the crazy shit is one
of the reasons we came here.

47:17.293 --> 47:21.505
See, something happened,
and it's something intense. I just--

47:22.089 --> 47:28.179
Um, I went to the doctor,
and they found a growth in my abdomen.

47:28.262 --> 47:31.432
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

47:31.515 --> 47:34.685
Yeah, and the doctor, I guess he says
it's-- it's only gonna get bigger.

47:36.228 --> 47:37.229
Can he operate on it?

47:37.313 --> 47:41.317
[crying] Unfortunately, they can't--
They can't. Sorry. They can't.

47:41.400 --> 47:45.613
The-- [clears throat] The doctors say
it's gonna come out on its own.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.240
Through her vagina.

47:48.324 --> 47:49.617
Huh?

47:51.285 --> 47:53.454
[chuckles]

47:53.537 --> 47:54.789
I'm preggers!

47:56.165 --> 47:58.084
That's how you're gonna make
that announcement?

47:58.167 --> 48:00.378
By-- By having us think
that you had cancer?

48:00.461 --> 48:02.671
-Yeah!
-Yeah! You guys. [chuckles]

48:02.755 --> 48:04.882
-Oh, congratulations, I guess.
-[Kyla] Thank you.

48:04.965 --> 48:06.342
Thank you.

48:06.425 --> 48:10.721
Guess, um… I'm really happy for you.

48:10.805 --> 48:13.599
Aw, thanks, pal.
Hey, that's not the whole story though.

48:13.682 --> 48:17.311
There's something about this baby
that has to deal with you directly.

48:20.981 --> 48:22.024
What do you mean?

48:22.108 --> 48:23.317
[Harold] Fubar!

48:24.235 --> 48:27.238
Fubar. My brain is absolutely fubar.

48:27.321 --> 48:29.698
I had the key in my other pocket
the whole time.

48:29.782 --> 48:30.908
[Kyla] You silly goose.

48:30.991 --> 48:32.451
-[Harold] Oh, God.
-[Kyla] You goofball.

48:32.535 --> 48:35.413
-Here we go.
-[Kyla] Yes.

48:36.831 --> 48:40.042
Oh, my God! This place is insane!

48:40.126 --> 48:41.919
[Ron] Permission to shit my pants,
Captain.

48:42.002 --> 48:44.380
[Harold] Permission granted. [chuckles]

48:44.463 --> 48:46.257
-[Ron] VCR!
-[sighs]

48:46.340 --> 48:48.634
-It's amazing!
-[Kyla] Ooh! I feel like Nancy Reagan.

48:48.717 --> 48:50.845
This should be our room.

48:51.929 --> 48:53.764
[Marcus whispering]
Mexico was seven months ago?

48:55.224 --> 48:56.475
Seven months?

48:57.852 --> 48:58.853
[Emily scoffs]

48:59.854 --> 49:00.938
Twice.

49:01.564 --> 49:03.858
Twice they've gotten
the Presidential Suite.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.234
How does this keep happening?

49:05.317 --> 49:06.652
[scoffs]

49:06.735 --> 49:09.196
-Baby, can I ask you something?
-Yes, babe.

49:09.822 --> 49:12.241
It's just a quick question.

49:12.324 --> 49:16.203
Just, I was wondering,
how far along did Kyla look to you?

49:17.037 --> 49:19.123
[chuckles] I don't know. Why?

49:19.206 --> 49:21.375
I mean, if you had to take a guess.
You know what I mean?

49:21.459 --> 49:24.086
Just a-- just-- just a guess.

49:25.254 --> 49:27.756
Oh, five months? Five and a half? Tops.

49:28.757 --> 49:29.925
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

49:30.009 --> 49:32.386
Yeah. Right. She five and a half months.

49:32.470 --> 49:35.389
She ain't-- She don't look
seven months at all, right? [chuckles]

49:35.473 --> 49:37.600
If she's seven months,
then I'm three months.

49:38.392 --> 49:39.435
And it's yours.

49:39.518 --> 49:40.561
[chuckling] Yeah, it's mine.

49:41.562 --> 49:43.314
-[Emily] Good night, love.
-Mm-hmm.

49:43.397 --> 49:44.440
-Mmm.
-[Marcus chuckles]

49:44.523 --> 49:47.693
[bugle playing]

49:47.776 --> 49:49.778
[dogs barking]

49:52.781 --> 49:54.116
[chuckles] Oh.

49:54.200 --> 49:55.993
Mr. Finnegan.

49:56.076 --> 49:59.079
You know, every time he does this,
I feel like I'm walking in on him.

49:59.955 --> 50:00.956
It's disgusting.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.208
[Harold sighs]

50:02.291 --> 50:05.503
I'd like to thank you all for coming out
for this magnificent tradition:

50:05.586 --> 50:08.923
-the pursuit of the elusive gray fox.
-[horse whinnies]

50:09.006 --> 50:11.717
Now there are a couple of rules
that I'd like you to keep in mind.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.928
-One…
-Baby, do you see either of them?

50:14.011 --> 50:15.387
No, thank God.

50:15.471 --> 50:18.224
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
I was trying to find the rest of my gear.

50:18.307 --> 50:19.558
-What the--
-[Kyla] Hey, lover!

50:19.642 --> 50:22.269
Look at what your girl found.

50:22.353 --> 50:23.437
-Whoo!
-Shh.

50:23.521 --> 50:26.106
It was in the truck the whole time.
It was just wedged under my seat.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.691
-You're the best.
-I know. I know.

50:27.775 --> 50:30.194
Oh. No, no, no. No guns.
No. No one's killing anything.

50:30.277 --> 50:31.320
-What?
-What?

50:31.403 --> 50:33.739
Yeah, it's not even a real fox hunt.
It's a fox chase.

50:33.822 --> 50:36.033
And no one's seen a fox
around here in years.

50:36.116 --> 50:39.495
By the way, Kyla, you're pregnant.
That means you're not coming.

50:39.578 --> 50:42.414
-Oh, fuck that.
-[dog barking]

50:42.498 --> 50:45.668
Excuse me! Lady in the purple.
How do I get one of those?

50:46.418 --> 50:48.546
Hey, chief.
Could you just get this to the front desk?

50:49.296 --> 50:51.006
Okay, baby. Let me get this straight.

50:51.090 --> 50:54.885
I spent the last three months waking up
at the crack of dawn

50:54.969 --> 50:57.429
to learn how to ride a horse
for a damn nature walk?

50:57.513 --> 50:59.223
And the most important rule of all…

50:59.306 --> 51:00.474
[barking continues]

51:00.558 --> 51:03.060
…have fun. [chuckles]

51:03.143 --> 51:06.397
["Ooh La La" playing]

51:22.871 --> 51:24.873
Nice grip. Solid trot.

51:25.666 --> 51:27.167
Marcus, I didn't realize you could ride.

51:27.251 --> 51:30.504
Oh, well, you know,
this ain't the tack that I'm used to.

51:30.588 --> 51:33.716
You know, I prefer western reins.
[chuckles]

51:33.799 --> 51:36.010
Oh, it's too bad you're wearing
the wrong jacket.

51:37.553 --> 51:40.431
Five buttons is strictly for houndsmen.
[clicks tongue]

51:40.514 --> 51:42.266
[dogs barking]

51:44.518 --> 51:48.063
Harsh. I got like 12 buttons
on my cargo shorts.

51:48.856 --> 51:50.357
That guy really doesn't like you, huh?

51:50.441 --> 51:51.442
You think?

51:52.276 --> 51:54.278
You know what? We'll show him.

51:55.696 --> 51:59.325
Come on, Marcus.
Let's go find a goddamn fox.

51:59.408 --> 52:01.243
-[Marcus] Wait, what?
-[Ron] Let's do this!

52:10.419 --> 52:14.131
Look, man. This is a big waste of time.
We are not gonna find a fox.

52:14.214 --> 52:17.635
Let's just ride back to the stables,
get some food because I'm starving.

52:17.718 --> 52:19.720
[birds chirping]

52:21.013 --> 52:23.390
Hungry no more. [laughs]

52:24.308 --> 52:25.309
That is…

52:27.227 --> 52:28.228
Oh!

52:28.312 --> 52:29.563
…reindeer moss.

52:30.856 --> 52:32.191
One of the edible Cladonias.

52:34.109 --> 52:35.319
You gonna eat that shit?

52:35.402 --> 52:37.154
Yeah, dude. It's a superfood.

52:37.237 --> 52:40.282
And it only grows in a rare section
of the loblolly pine ecosystem.

52:40.366 --> 52:41.867
Okay, how you know all this weird crap?

52:41.950 --> 52:44.912
Licensed edible forager, man.
Any self-respecting ranger is.

52:44.995 --> 52:45.996
Try some?

52:46.705 --> 52:48.624
Nah, I'm good on the tree pubes.

52:48.707 --> 52:50.834
[laughs]

52:50.918 --> 52:51.919
Tree pubes!

52:52.002 --> 52:54.546
Why you laughing so hard?
It wasn't even that funny.

52:54.630 --> 52:56.965
You know, that--
that's a joke Charlie would say.

52:57.049 --> 52:59.093
Sometimes I can't even tell
the two of you apart.

52:59.176 --> 53:00.594
Here, check this out. [grunts]

53:02.012 --> 53:05.099
There. Look. [laughing] There he is.
Look at that. You see?

53:06.850 --> 53:08.519
-That's Charlie?
-Yeah, that's Charlie.

53:08.602 --> 53:12.147
We look nothing alike, okay?
This is a pale white man with red hair.

53:12.231 --> 53:16.026
I'm not talking about his looks, man.
I'm talking about his spirit.

53:16.110 --> 53:19.113
You both got this hard shell
on the outside,

53:19.196 --> 53:21.824
then one bite
and you get to the gooey center.

53:22.324 --> 53:24.201
Now come on. Eat the moss.

53:26.537 --> 53:28.122
You're lucky I'm hungry.

53:32.626 --> 53:35.629
Okay. It's not that bad.

53:35.713 --> 53:38.465
Boom! Mind open.

53:39.883 --> 53:42.970
See, man. It's like
nature's crisper drawer out here.

53:43.053 --> 53:46.223
Ooh! Some ramps!
The onion's wild cousin. [grunts]

53:48.058 --> 53:49.810
[chuckles] Try that.

53:49.893 --> 53:51.687
Oh, man.

53:52.354 --> 53:53.564
Jackpot.

53:54.898 --> 53:56.817
[chuckles]

53:56.900 --> 53:57.901
Oh, man.

54:00.154 --> 54:02.072
Okay, look.
I know you're not a big drug guy,

54:02.156 --> 54:05.159
but if you ever wanna unlock the doors to
perception, this, my friend, is the key.

54:05.242 --> 54:06.076
Wait, what?

54:06.160 --> 54:08.829
Primarily found in Spain, but around here,
we call it the Devil's Dick.

54:09.496 --> 54:11.331
Most potent magic mushroom on Earth.

54:11.415 --> 54:13.876
You eat one of these babies,
not only will you talk to God,

54:13.959 --> 54:16.170
you'll find a rent-controlled apartment
and move in together.

54:16.253 --> 54:17.588
-I ate it.
-What?

54:18.422 --> 54:19.798
I ate it.

54:19.882 --> 54:21.508
-Why?
-You told me to!

54:21.592 --> 54:24.052
I said, "Jackpot," and that's it.
I didn't say, "Eat it."

54:24.136 --> 54:26.013
Man, you are crazy, okay?

54:26.096 --> 54:29.308
Everything you touch turn into drugs!

54:29.391 --> 54:30.809
Okay? What's gonna happen to me?

54:30.893 --> 54:32.060
Am I about to die?

54:32.144 --> 54:34.104
No, no. You're not gonna die. Okay?

54:34.188 --> 54:36.982
Part of you is gonna die,
but it's gonna be reborn. You'll be fine.

54:37.065 --> 54:39.026
Something's happening
because everything is purple now.

54:39.109 --> 54:41.612
No, no, no, no. You're being paranoid.
It takes 20 minutes to kick in.

54:41.695 --> 54:42.654
Everything's purple!

54:42.738 --> 54:43.739
Oh, shit.

54:44.615 --> 54:46.200
I guess only a rookie chasms that fast.

54:47.743 --> 54:49.119
You need a rope man. Okay.

54:50.829 --> 54:53.874
-Marcus, I'm going in with you.
-Mm-hmm.

54:53.957 --> 54:56.835
Every step of the way.
[inhales deeply] Deep breaths.

54:56.919 --> 54:59.087
-[inhales] Okay.
-I mean, this is from me to you.

54:59.171 --> 55:03.091
You're a big guy. Focus. Concentrate.

55:04.092 --> 55:06.678
There is a good chance
that nothing's gonna happen.

55:06.762 --> 55:08.764
["So What'cha Want" playing]

55:08.847 --> 55:12.142
[both laughing]

55:26.615 --> 55:28.033
-[music stops]
-[horse whinnies]

55:29.785 --> 55:31.036
[Kyla] Emily!

55:31.119 --> 55:33.747
I know I've only been here for a night,
but I've gotta say,

55:33.831 --> 55:35.249
this wedding is so kick-ass.

55:35.332 --> 55:36.959
Well, at least someone's enjoying it.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.043
[Kyla] How could you not?

55:38.126 --> 55:39.586
Your family's so freaking cool.

55:39.670 --> 55:42.756
Everybody's in love with me,
and I haven't even met half of them yet.

55:42.840 --> 55:46.635
Yeah, uh, don't-- don't feel pressured,
like, to meet everyone.

55:46.718 --> 55:49.096
You're so sweet.
No, I promise you. You have my word.

55:49.179 --> 55:52.808
I'm gonna have meaningful connections
with literally every single person here.

55:52.891 --> 55:55.519
I was just so busy talking
to Grandma Phyllis last night

55:55.602 --> 55:57.187
that I couldn't make the rounds.

55:57.271 --> 55:59.690
No, Phyllis barely even speaks.

55:59.773 --> 56:02.484
She's a major, major
chatterbox deep down.

56:02.568 --> 56:05.988
Harold, I don't know if this is just
Grandma Phyllis starting shit,

56:06.071 --> 56:07.114
but… [chuckles]

56:07.197 --> 56:10.367
…she said that this wedding
was already more fun than yours was.

56:11.076 --> 56:12.202
That's not surprising.

56:13.996 --> 56:14.997
What does that mean?

56:17.165 --> 56:21.044
Well, um, there was a bit of tension
at our wedding.

56:21.962 --> 56:24.298
It wasn't Phyllis.
It was your grandfather and I.

56:24.381 --> 56:29.344
We just got off on the wrong foot,
and he never gave me another chance.

56:30.095 --> 56:31.221
That sounds familiar.

56:31.305 --> 56:34.892
Maybe now's the perfect time
for you to give Marcus another chance.

56:34.975 --> 56:36.894
-[music resumes]
-Wow.

[music ends]

56:45.611 --> 56:48.196
[wind whistling]

56:48.280 --> 56:50.157
[distorted] Did you hear that?

56:50.240 --> 56:52.367
[distorted] Oh… Oh, I heard that.
Did you hear that?

56:52.451 --> 56:54.453
I heard it. I didn't know I could hear--

56:54.536 --> 56:57.664
It's like, I know I can see shit,
but I didn't know I was hearing shit too.

56:57.748 --> 56:58.957
[branch breaks]

56:59.041 --> 57:01.418
[footsteps approaching]

57:01.501 --> 57:02.836
What is that?

57:04.546 --> 57:05.547
It's a fox.

57:06.840 --> 57:07.841
[chuckles]

57:07.925 --> 57:10.302
-It's a fox.
-It's gotta be a fox.

57:23.315 --> 57:24.441
[whispering] Behind you.

57:33.617 --> 57:35.494
-Don't move.
-[whispering] Okay.

57:36.078 --> 57:37.496
Or make a sound.

57:37.579 --> 57:39.081
Don't say a single word.

57:39.164 --> 57:40.290
You're talking right now.

57:40.374 --> 57:41.375
No, I'm not.

57:43.752 --> 57:44.753
So what do we do?

57:44.836 --> 57:47.381
I'm gonna go make a snare
out of that flora.

57:49.049 --> 57:50.050
You stay here.

57:50.801 --> 57:52.970
What do you mean, "Stay here," Ron?
Where you going?

57:53.053 --> 57:55.389
Ron. Ron.

57:56.098 --> 57:57.099
Ron.

57:57.683 --> 57:59.059
Don't worry.

57:59.726 --> 58:02.229
Foxes are a completely
nonaggressive species.

58:02.312 --> 58:03.772
-[growling]
-[screaming]

58:04.690 --> 58:06.066
[Marcus] Get it off me!

58:06.149 --> 58:07.609
[dog barking]

58:07.693 --> 58:10.696
It's Mr. Finnegan. He spotted something!

58:12.364 --> 58:13.490
Mount up, everyone!

58:13.573 --> 58:15.450
[screaming continues]

58:15.534 --> 58:17.494
-Get off me!
-Grab it! Subdue it!

58:17.577 --> 58:20.288
Fuck that! Get it off me!

58:20.372 --> 58:22.457
-[growling]
-Fuck! Get it off!

58:29.047 --> 58:30.382
What are you doing?

58:30.465 --> 58:32.217
[growling continues]

58:34.052 --> 58:36.054
[horse whinnies]

58:43.729 --> 58:45.397
Mr. Finnegan likes him.

58:48.734 --> 58:50.235
What the fuck?

58:50.318 --> 58:51.820
[Harold] Mr. Finnegan. [whistles]

58:52.821 --> 58:54.573
[sighs] Marcus, are you okay?

58:54.656 --> 58:56.241
Sweetie, I will…

58:59.036 --> 59:00.412
Let me help you up there.

59:02.664 --> 59:03.749
[grunts]

59:04.332 --> 59:06.960
This isn't easy to say, Marcus,

59:07.878 --> 59:10.630
but I think we've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

59:10.714 --> 59:12.966
I see things my way, and--

59:13.050 --> 59:15.427
[laughs]

59:15.510 --> 59:16.845
What's so funny?

59:16.928 --> 59:18.430
You're a clown!

59:19.765 --> 59:21.808
-Excuse me?
-[Marcus] You're a clown.

59:22.934 --> 59:25.020
[laughs]

59:25.103 --> 59:27.856
Look, if I can interject
for just a second, Harold.

59:27.939 --> 59:29.900
Marcus and I have been talking
about you all weekend.

59:29.983 --> 59:31.902
-What? About my being a clown?
-[Ron] Yes.

59:31.985 --> 59:35.280
Yes, but, you know,
a wedding is like a big, old circus.

59:35.363 --> 59:38.450
And you, you're the star of the show.

59:38.533 --> 59:39.618
[Marcus] Oh, shit.

59:40.911 --> 59:43.121
-I'm made of metal.
-What-- What is going on here?

59:43.830 --> 59:47.876
Uh, what Marcus means is
that his commitment to your daughter…

59:49.044 --> 59:50.212
is as strong as steel.

59:51.171 --> 59:53.840
Captain, Marcus has told me many times
that he looks up to you.

59:54.841 --> 59:56.510
And he hopes that one day,

59:56.593 --> 59:59.596
you can all become a real, true family
despite your differences.

59:59.679 --> 1:00:00.680
No!

1:00:02.390 --> 1:00:03.391
Because of them.

1:00:03.475 --> 1:00:04.434
He said that?

1:00:04.518 --> 1:00:05.644
He did. Word for word.

1:00:06.228 --> 1:00:07.229
You said that?

1:00:09.397 --> 1:00:10.440
Mm-hmm.

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:18.281
Lieutenant.

1:00:20.534 --> 1:00:21.535
Whatever.

1:00:22.994 --> 1:00:24.788
Oh, fuck. He bought it, dude. I can't--

1:00:25.539 --> 1:00:28.708
What the fuck? Metal? Come on. Shit.

1:00:28.792 --> 1:00:30.460
-I'm in the circus.
-[huffs]

1:00:31.128 --> 1:00:33.964
[Marcus] Do you realize
I almost killed that dog? Fucking Ron.

1:00:34.047 --> 1:00:35.423
[Emily] Hey, cut him some slack.

1:00:35.507 --> 1:00:38.468
He actually covered for you with my dad.

1:00:38.552 --> 1:00:41.304
Like, he kind of saved your ass.

1:00:41.388 --> 1:00:43.557
Wait a minute.
Is Grandma Phyllis over there talking?

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:45.016
How's that even possible?

1:00:45.100 --> 1:00:47.936
[Emily] Kyla has been really obsessed
with her lately.

1:00:48.019 --> 1:00:50.021
Uh-uh. This is not good.

1:00:51.356 --> 1:00:52.357
[chuckles]

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:54.025
Damn, how many cousins I got?

1:00:54.109 --> 1:00:56.111
Some happy cousins. Why they so happy?

1:00:56.194 --> 1:00:57.529
I don't know.

1:00:57.612 --> 1:00:59.406
Tell 'em I say hi. [chuckles]

1:01:07.956 --> 1:01:10.625
Hey, good morning, sleepyhead.
I was just getting this for you.

1:01:10.709 --> 1:01:12.878
A little something to get
those synapses firing.

1:01:14.129 --> 1:01:16.548
-Why? What you put in here?
-It's grapefruit juice.

1:01:17.549 --> 1:01:18.884
And heroin.

1:01:19.718 --> 1:01:22.262
Kidding. Just drink it.
You'll feel better.

1:01:23.013 --> 1:01:24.890
-Can I be honest with you, man?
-Yeah.

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:27.017
I really don't get you.

1:01:27.684 --> 1:01:28.977
What's there to get?

1:01:29.060 --> 1:01:31.563
I mean, everywhere we go,
chaos happens. Right?

1:01:32.189 --> 1:01:34.399
But everybody else panics, but not you.

1:01:34.482 --> 1:01:37.444
You stay calm and collected.
Like, you don't worry about any of it.

1:01:37.527 --> 1:01:39.154
One night in Green Beret training,

1:01:39.237 --> 1:01:41.573
they woke us up, put us in a boat,
drove us a mile offshore,

1:01:41.656 --> 1:01:43.408
dumped us in the water
and said, "Swim back."

1:01:44.117 --> 1:01:45.994
I watched so many guys
wear themselves out

1:01:46.077 --> 1:01:48.038
swimming against the riptide
as hard as they could.

1:01:48.121 --> 1:01:53.668
They had to be extracted. Me?
I found out the trick was just float.

1:01:54.419 --> 1:01:57.422
Look, I've never been the type of person
that can just float, you know?

1:01:57.505 --> 1:01:58.965
Marcus, you're missing the point.

1:01:59.049 --> 1:02:03.053
Yeah, real story, but a metaphor, because
it has nothing to do with your body mass.

1:02:03.136 --> 1:02:05.472
I understand that. I mean,
I know what metaphors are. I was--

1:02:05.555 --> 1:02:07.891
Do you? Do you?

1:02:07.974 --> 1:02:11.978
If it isn't Special Forces
and special… stupid idiot.

1:02:12.062 --> 1:02:13.939
You're lucky you didn't hurt
my dad's dog yesterday,

1:02:14.022 --> 1:02:15.649
'cause if you did, I would've hurt you.

1:02:15.732 --> 1:02:19.319
Okay, Gabe. Is that right?
Right? You gonna kick my ass?

1:02:19.402 --> 1:02:21.446
-You wanna go right here, right now?
-I think he wants to.

1:02:21.529 --> 1:02:22.781
'Cause we can do that.

1:02:22.864 --> 1:02:26.284
If I may. Gabe, it looks like
you're trying to lead with a power jab.

1:02:26.368 --> 1:02:28.828
Let's get those hips in. Get warmed up--

1:02:28.912 --> 1:02:31.248
Hey. What are you-- Hands off.

1:02:31.331 --> 1:02:32.457
Whoa! Okay, man. I'm just--

1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:34.084
Listen, I'm not here to fight anyway.

1:02:34.167 --> 1:02:35.835
My father sent me here
to collect the rings.

1:02:35.919 --> 1:02:39.089
I guess the best man is supposed to
carry the rings, so that's why I'm here.

1:02:41.424 --> 1:02:46.638
You know something? I'ma give these to
my best man, but to my new best man,
Ron.

1:02:46.721 --> 1:02:48.265
-Here you go, brother.
-You mean it?

1:02:48.348 --> 1:02:50.433
-Can he do that?
-No, he cannot do that.

1:02:50.517 --> 1:02:53.603
It's already been done. That's right.
That's my best man right there.

1:02:53.687 --> 1:02:57.357
Marcus, this means…
more to me than you'll ever know.

1:02:58.191 --> 1:02:59.901
[Marcus] Oh, man. It's all good, br--

1:03:02.821 --> 1:03:03.655
<i>Salaam.</i>

1:03:06.992 --> 1:03:07.993
Whatever. Okay.

1:03:08.076 --> 1:03:09.744
See you at tee off, assholes.

1:03:12.289 --> 1:03:14.291
I do not like the way they talk to you.

1:03:15.959 --> 1:03:18.295
All right. They gone.
You can give me the rings back.

1:03:18.378 --> 1:03:20.380
What? No. I-- You-- We just said-- What?

1:03:20.463 --> 1:03:22.716
No, no. That--
I was doing that in front of them.

1:03:22.799 --> 1:03:25.218
I'm actually gonna keep the rings,
so you just give 'em back to me.

1:03:25.302 --> 1:03:28.221
Marcus, you made me your best man.
That's that. Best man holds the rings.

1:03:28.305 --> 1:03:30.598
Yes, I know what
"traditionally" the best man do--

1:03:30.682 --> 1:03:32.726
You can't just say
the best man holds the rings

1:03:32.809 --> 1:03:34.936
and then not let
the best man hold the rings.

1:03:35.020 --> 1:03:36.104
I got you.

1:03:39.691 --> 1:03:42.861
Well, Marcus, good to have you back.

1:03:42.944 --> 1:03:44.279
That sunstroke is no joke.

1:03:44.362 --> 1:03:49.617
So, people,
stay hydrated with-- with water.

1:03:49.701 --> 1:03:53.955
The marshals are very strict when it
comes to alcohol, wagering and profanity.

1:03:54.581 --> 1:03:57.500
-Now we're on a championship course
here. -[shaman chanting]

1:03:57.584 --> 1:04:01.129
So we are going
to be keeping this club pristine.

1:04:01.212 --> 1:04:05.675
So, Gabe, uh, why don't you and Bennett
play with Marcus and Ron today.

1:04:05.759 --> 1:04:06.926
Where's Ron anyway?

1:04:07.010 --> 1:04:08.011
Got your six, Captain.

1:04:08.094 --> 1:04:11.681
Ah, Lieutenant, good to see you.
Hope you're comfortable in a foursome.

1:04:11.765 --> 1:04:13.725
As long as there's
at least one girl involved.

1:04:16.186 --> 1:04:18.563
All right, dick holes.
How much we betting?

1:04:18.646 --> 1:04:21.649
Hey, hey, man. Didn't you hear
what he said? No drinking and no
gambling.

1:04:21.733 --> 1:04:24.194
Marcus. Relax. Have some fun, all right?

1:04:24.277 --> 1:04:25.695
What do you say a hundred a hole?

1:04:25.779 --> 1:04:26.780
Count me in.

1:04:26.863 --> 1:04:27.739
[Bennett] Me too.

1:04:27.822 --> 1:04:31.284
Tell you what. Let's keep it fresh.
Back nine we double the stakes.

1:04:31.368 --> 1:04:32.786
-Double?
-Problem?

1:04:32.869 --> 1:04:35.163
[chuckles] Please.
You see what I'm driving?

1:04:35.246 --> 1:04:36.539
[Ron] That's you, the red one?

1:04:37.916 --> 1:04:39.542
What is that? A Corvette, pre-owned?

1:04:39.626 --> 1:04:42.212
-It's a Ferrari, you dipshit.
-$250,000.

1:04:42.295 --> 1:04:43.546
-Bought her brand-new.
-Boom.

1:04:43.630 --> 1:04:44.672
[imitates sizzle]

1:04:44.756 --> 1:04:47.008
[Gabe] Now, Marcus,
I understand a hundred dollars a hole

1:04:47.092 --> 1:04:48.843
is a lot of green
for a blue-collar worker,

1:04:48.927 --> 1:04:50.595
so if you need to back out,
go ahead and do it now.

1:04:50.678 --> 1:04:51.763
-Fuck you.
-Fuck you.

1:04:51.846 --> 1:04:53.014
-No, fuck you.
-Fuck you again.

1:04:53.098 --> 1:04:55.558
No, kiss my-- You know?
Let me holla at you real quick.

1:04:55.642 --> 1:04:56.768
Can you excuse us?

1:04:57.894 --> 1:04:59.771
Man, I don't have that type of green.

1:04:59.854 --> 1:05:02.232
Marcus, don't worry. I'll bankroll you.
Pay me back later.

1:05:02.315 --> 1:05:03.983
Bankroll me with what?

1:05:04.067 --> 1:05:05.068
How about this?

1:05:05.944 --> 1:05:06.986
Where'd you get that?

1:05:07.070 --> 1:05:09.823
Who cares? Just help me whup
the Brooks Brothers over there. Come on.

1:05:09.906 --> 1:05:11.491
I would love to beat these two assholes…

1:05:11.574 --> 1:05:12.992
-Do it.
-…but I suck at golf!

1:05:13.076 --> 1:05:14.702
That's why you're lucky
I'm your best man.

1:05:15.578 --> 1:05:17.705
["Space Ho's" playing]

1:05:23.044 --> 1:05:25.255
What was that?
Thought you said you was good?

1:05:25.338 --> 1:05:26.965
I am. I just gotta get warmed up.

1:05:28.466 --> 1:05:29.801
You gotta get warmed up?

1:05:29.884 --> 1:05:31.553
-Want a hit?
-No!

1:05:31.636 --> 1:05:33.638
[song continues]

1:05:37.142 --> 1:05:39.018
Woo-hoo!

1:05:39.102 --> 1:05:41.563
[Gabe, Bennett] Ha! Ha!

1:05:44.816 --> 1:05:47.652
Thank you so much. [chuckles]

1:05:50.238 --> 1:05:54.075
[Emily's mother] Jesus,
I wish we had never hired this caterer.

1:05:54.159 --> 1:05:55.952
Now he's telling me

1:05:56.035 --> 1:05:58.538
that he's having trouble sourcing steaks
for tomorrow night.

1:05:58.621 --> 1:06:00.582
I'm so sorry,
but I do just have to go on record

1:06:00.665 --> 1:06:02.500
and say that I told you
to go with Ford Fry.

1:06:02.584 --> 1:06:04.335
-You did not listen to me…
-Brooke, please.

1:06:04.419 --> 1:06:06.921
Okay. [stammers] Guys, please, for me.

1:06:07.005 --> 1:06:11.217
Mom, I am super positive
that the caterer will figure it all out.

1:06:11.301 --> 1:06:15.013
So for the next two hours,
can we just not think about steak?

1:06:15.096 --> 1:06:17.140
-Yes, dear.
-[whispering] Thank you.

1:06:17.223 --> 1:06:20.685
Wait, guys, steaks?
I know a place that has amazing steaks.

1:06:20.768 --> 1:06:23.771
Ron and I just went there on our way
here 'cause it's right down the block.

1:06:23.855 --> 1:06:27.525
Hal's in Buckhead?
They were asking $300 a plate.

1:06:27.609 --> 1:06:29.694
Oh, no. Girl, this place is under ten.

1:06:29.777 --> 1:06:31.321
Damn, that's a steal.

1:06:31.404 --> 1:06:34.115
-What restaurant is this?
-Oh, it's called Waffle House.

1:06:34.699 --> 1:06:37.035
[all laughing]

1:06:39.370 --> 1:06:41.664
Well, even I don't like Waffle House.

1:06:41.748 --> 1:06:43.708
Trust me, you guys. It's amazing.

1:06:43.791 --> 1:06:46.419
-Oh, my God. Is she serious?
-No, no, Mom. She's--

1:06:46.503 --> 1:06:50.924
Whenever Ron and I are stressed or
horny or I have trouble going number
two--

1:06:51.007 --> 1:06:52.592
Hey, Kyla. You know what?

1:06:52.675 --> 1:06:55.637
I think we're gonna just be here
in this moment,

1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:58.681
enjoying the spa, relaxing. Yeah.

1:06:58.765 --> 1:07:02.435
Got you, Em. I swear I will stop talking,
and we should get our Zen on, right?

1:07:02.519 --> 1:07:04.229
'Cause that's why we're at the spa.

1:07:04.312 --> 1:07:05.855
[sighs]

1:07:06.648 --> 1:07:10.068
Oh, Brooke, you remember when we had
our spa day right before your wedding?

1:07:10.985 --> 1:07:12.403
Those hot stones were--

1:07:12.487 --> 1:07:13.738
[sobbing]

1:07:13.821 --> 1:07:16.199
Oh, my God. Not again, please.

1:07:16.282 --> 1:07:18.535
-[Marcus's mother] Oh, no.
-[Kyla] What's the matter?

1:07:20.036 --> 1:07:21.371
We're getting destroyed out there.

1:07:21.454 --> 1:07:23.790
-I thought you said you was good?
-I am good. You'll see.

1:07:23.873 --> 1:07:25.041
Ernesto!

1:07:27.085 --> 1:07:28.086
Sorry.

1:07:30.004 --> 1:07:31.381
[Bennett sighs]

1:07:31.965 --> 1:07:33.216
My man.

1:07:34.467 --> 1:07:35.426
Love that guy.

1:07:35.510 --> 1:07:36.970
Did you just tip him $100?

1:07:37.554 --> 1:07:38.471
I have plenty left.

1:07:38.555 --> 1:07:40.181
Where did you get all that cash from?

1:07:41.391 --> 1:07:43.017
I pawned the wedding rings.

1:07:43.601 --> 1:07:44.852
-No, you didn't.
-No, I did.

1:07:45.853 --> 1:07:47.146
-No, you didn't.
-No, I did.

1:07:47.230 --> 1:07:49.399
-No, you didn't.
-I did. Totally. Here.

1:07:50.233 --> 1:07:53.111
Here's the receipt.
Northside Jewelry and Loans.

1:07:55.613 --> 1:07:56.948
[whispering] Oh, you did.

1:07:58.157 --> 1:08:01.035
What the hell is wrong with you?

1:08:01.119 --> 1:08:02.495
I just got good with Harold.

1:08:02.579 --> 1:08:04.122
Pick 'em up when we win.

1:08:04.205 --> 1:08:05.623
Pick 'em up when we win?

1:08:05.707 --> 1:08:08.459
[shouting] We're losing every hole!

1:08:08.543 --> 1:08:12.338
-[birds chirping]
-[man] Come on, gentlemen. Man on the
tee.

1:08:12.839 --> 1:08:15.633
[sniffles] I'm so sorry.
I just can't breathe right now.

1:08:15.717 --> 1:08:17.302
-[Emily's mother] Oh!
-[Kyla] Brooke.

1:08:17.385 --> 1:08:19.387
Sweetheart, it's okay. What's wrong?

1:08:19.470 --> 1:08:21.806
Back when we were dating,
Darren was so sweet.

1:08:21.889 --> 1:08:23.224
No, he wasn't.

1:08:23.308 --> 1:08:24.851
[Brooke] A little. He was a little sweet.

1:08:24.934 --> 1:08:27.270
Well, what did Darren do to you,
sweetheart?

1:08:27.353 --> 1:08:29.897
He's super mean to me all the time.
He says mean things.

1:08:29.981 --> 1:08:31.608
Sweetie, what do you do about it?

1:08:31.691 --> 1:08:33.443
-Kyla.
-What? No, I'm serious.

1:08:33.526 --> 1:08:35.737
-What do you mean? I--
-Okay, guys. Here's the thing.

1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:39.324
I dated a lot of shitheads
before I met Ron, love of my life.

1:08:39.407 --> 1:08:41.993
They were just like Darren.
These are the kind of guys that are like--

1:08:42.076 --> 1:08:44.912
They think they're the alpha,
but deep down,

1:08:44.996 --> 1:08:47.540
-they know they're just a little bitch.
-Okay, Kyla…

1:08:47.624 --> 1:08:51.044
Next time Darren steps out of line,
you pop him in the balls.

1:08:51.127 --> 1:08:52.086
Who are you?

1:08:52.170 --> 1:08:53.504
-You can do it very nicely.
-This person is insane.

1:08:53.588 --> 1:08:56.174
I have a couple restraining orders.
It's not that big of a deal.

1:08:56.257 --> 1:08:59.260
-[muttering]
-This is a criminal. This is a criminal.

1:08:59.344 --> 1:09:01.846
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah. Let's go chat.

1:09:01.929 --> 1:09:04.891
Are you sure you wanna leave them?
Because we have our massages in two
minutes,

1:09:04.974 --> 1:09:07.352
-and we're getting so much free shit--
-What are you doing?

1:09:07.435 --> 1:09:12.231
What? I was just trying to be helpful
and give your sister some advice.

1:09:12.315 --> 1:09:14.984
By suggesting that she pop her husband
in the balls?

1:09:15.068 --> 1:09:16.194
Yes.

1:09:16.778 --> 1:09:19.030
-Oh, my God. Please.
-What?

1:09:19.113 --> 1:09:23.993
Kyla,
this weekend is already so stressful.

1:09:24.077 --> 1:09:27.288
All I'm asking is that you not add
to that stress.

1:09:27.914 --> 1:09:29.415
Can you please do that for me?

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:31.459
[whispering] Okay.

1:09:32.168 --> 1:09:33.294
Why are you whispering?

1:09:33.378 --> 1:09:35.880
Well, because you thought
I was too loud in there.

1:09:37.215 --> 1:09:39.217
[sighs] God.

1:09:39.300 --> 1:09:40.677
[Gabe, Ron] Two, three, four.

1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:43.096
-[groans]
-[groans, chuckles]

1:09:43.179 --> 1:09:45.264
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Put some respect on it.

1:09:45.348 --> 1:09:46.849
Watch out.

1:09:46.933 --> 1:09:48.976
-[Marcus] Okay. How much you got left?
-Not a lot.

1:09:49.060 --> 1:09:51.729
-We're gonna never get those rings back.
-[Ron] All right, boys. Last hole.

1:09:51.813 --> 1:09:52.855
Let's do something big.

1:09:52.939 --> 1:09:55.692
Double or nothing. All in. I stick it
on the green from here in one shot.

1:09:55.775 --> 1:09:58.319
Double or nothing? That's what you-- No!

1:09:58.403 --> 1:10:00.071
No. No double or nothing. No!

1:10:00.154 --> 1:10:02.198
You do realize
you haven't hit a green all day, right?

1:10:02.281 --> 1:10:04.158
Wait. Haven't I?

1:10:04.242 --> 1:10:07.578
You know what? We're in. Actually,
let's make it a little interesting.

1:10:07.662 --> 1:10:09.622
Let's put Bennett's Ferrari in the pot.

1:10:09.706 --> 1:10:11.791
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

1:10:11.874 --> 1:10:12.959
That's like 45 grand.

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.335
Forty-five thousand?

1:10:16.504 --> 1:10:17.505
It's pre-owned.

1:10:18.214 --> 1:10:19.215
We can match that.

1:10:20.508 --> 1:10:25.012
One shot. I stick it on the 18th green
from here, we win.

1:10:26.013 --> 1:10:28.558
I miss by an inch, we lose.

1:10:28.641 --> 1:10:32.186
Ron. Ron. I can't do that.

1:10:32.270 --> 1:10:34.689
Come on. You can, man.
Remember, just float.

1:10:34.772 --> 1:10:36.816
What the fuck you mean floating?
Fuck floating.

1:10:36.899 --> 1:10:37.900
[Bennett] Fine.

1:10:38.484 --> 1:10:39.694
-It's a bet.
-Fine.

1:10:42.071 --> 1:10:43.030
All right, gentlemen.

1:10:43.114 --> 1:10:46.367
For the record, this is a Titleist 7
with two pink dots. Do we agree?

1:10:46.451 --> 1:10:49.579
Yes. We do agree that
you are a dumbass.

1:10:49.662 --> 1:10:51.205
That is the wrong hole.

1:10:51.289 --> 1:10:52.498
That's the seventh green.

1:10:52.582 --> 1:10:56.461
The 18th green… that way.

1:11:05.928 --> 1:11:08.681
Three hundred and seventy-five yards.
Dogleg left.

1:11:08.765 --> 1:11:10.391
Good luck hitting over the trees.

1:11:10.475 --> 1:11:11.851
[Bennett] And no backing out.

1:11:12.393 --> 1:11:13.519
We shook on it.

1:11:13.603 --> 1:11:15.104
-Mm-hmm.
-[Bennett giggling]

1:11:15.688 --> 1:11:16.522
Aw.

1:11:16.606 --> 1:11:17.607
[Bennett chuckles]

1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:24.947
I can't watch this.

1:11:29.243 --> 1:11:30.244
[sighs]

1:11:53.226 --> 1:11:54.560
[together] Whoa.

1:11:55.812 --> 1:11:57.730
-[shaman chanting]
-[sighs]

1:12:05.363 --> 1:12:06.739
-[Bennett] You see it?
-[Gabe] No.

1:12:06.823 --> 1:12:08.324
-Do you see-- No. No, no.
-[cart approaching]

1:12:08.407 --> 1:12:09.575
It's not on the green.

1:12:11.244 --> 1:12:13.996
It's not on the green.
Oh. It's not on the green.

1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:15.957
Could've sworn I got all of it.

1:12:17.208 --> 1:12:18.501
Check the cup.

1:12:18.584 --> 1:12:20.586
-Check the cup? [chuckles]
-Check these nuts.

1:12:24.423 --> 1:12:27.301
[shaman chanting]

1:12:29.679 --> 1:12:30.680
"Titleist 7."

1:12:31.639 --> 1:12:33.099
Two pink dots.

1:12:33.683 --> 1:12:34.976
What?

1:12:35.059 --> 1:12:36.644
-[Ron, Marcus laughing]
-[alarm chirps]

1:12:36.727 --> 1:12:37.562
[Ron] Yes.

1:12:37.645 --> 1:12:40.773
[Marcus] You was hustling them the
whole time? Where you learn to play like
that?

1:12:40.857 --> 1:12:44.902
[Ron] Army shrink. He said golf was good
for PTSD. I got a little obsessed.

1:12:44.986 --> 1:12:47.029
But that was a hole in one.
What are the chances?

1:12:47.113 --> 1:12:48.447
[chuckling] Uh, roughly zero.

1:12:48.531 --> 1:12:50.992
-So, you cheated?
-I do not cheat.

1:12:51.075 --> 1:12:52.618
I put that on the green fair and square.

1:12:52.702 --> 1:12:55.288
Ernesto. Remember my guy?

1:12:55.371 --> 1:12:58.040
I had him kick it in the cup to make
it awesome, which it totally was.

1:12:58.124 --> 1:13:00.585
Well, look at you now, brother.
You own a new Ferrari.

1:13:00.668 --> 1:13:03.421
Nah, man. We'll enjoy this for a bit,
but I'm-- I'm giving it back.

1:13:04.297 --> 1:13:05.840
I only did it for one reason, Marcus.

1:13:06.674 --> 1:13:11.137
No one, and I mean no one, talks to you
the way they did at breakfast.

1:13:11.220 --> 1:13:14.307
Thank you. And I appreciate that.
So, we can-- Can we just go get the
ring--

1:13:14.390 --> 1:13:17.727
You made me your best man, and with
that comes a solemn oath of
responsibility.

1:13:18.978 --> 1:13:21.230
Cool. And you're right. It comes with--

1:13:21.314 --> 1:13:23.399
Responsibility to always have your back.

1:13:24.358 --> 1:13:30.239
I give you my word.
I will never, ever… ever let you down.

1:13:30.323 --> 1:13:31.490
Ron, I get it.

1:13:31.574 --> 1:13:35.578
I get it. You got my back. But can we now
go get the rings? Like-- Like right now.

1:13:35.661 --> 1:13:37.079
Sure, man. What's the rush?

1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:39.749
Pawnshop closes at 6:00. It's like 2:45.

1:13:39.832 --> 1:13:41.500
What are you talking about? It's 5:45.

1:13:41.584 --> 1:13:43.127
Oh, shit. [chuckles]

1:13:43.210 --> 1:13:45.546
My watch is still on Oregon time.
I never changed it.

1:13:45.630 --> 1:13:48.966
I was wondering why it gets dark
out here so early.

1:13:50.718 --> 1:13:51.552
What?

1:13:51.636 --> 1:13:53.512

-[sighs]
-[Ron] See, man? Just like I told you.

1:14:35.471 --> 1:14:38.683
You just gotta float and, somehow,
it all works out. You feel better?

1:14:39.517 --> 1:14:42.144
-Did you ask me if I feel better?
-Yeah.

1:14:42.228 --> 1:14:43.229
Are you serious?

1:14:43.938 --> 1:14:46.190
Do I feel better?
You know how close that was?

1:14:46.273 --> 1:14:49.360
If I had lost these rings,
that whole family would've been on my
ass!

1:14:51.112 --> 1:14:53.114
[ominous music playing]

1:14:59.870 --> 1:15:00.788
[gasps]

1:15:02.123 --> 1:15:04.041
What if somebody came in
and bought these rings?

1:15:04.125 --> 1:15:05.835
We wouldn't have been able
to get back the rings.

1:15:05.918 --> 1:15:09.422
We'd have to get some rings from some
dead person's fingers that I don't even
know.

1:15:23.436 --> 1:15:26.188
[cawing]

1:15:26.272 --> 1:15:28.649
What should I feel better about?
You know what I'll feel better about?

1:15:28.733 --> 1:15:30.818
When we get back
to that stuffy ass country club

1:15:30.901 --> 1:15:35.489
and get these goddamn Conway family
rings on our goddamn fingers.

1:15:37.783 --> 1:15:39.160
[cawing continues]

1:15:39.243 --> 1:15:43.205
[distorted] That bird's about to shit.

1:15:43.873 --> 1:15:45.541
That's what would happen If I lost these--

1:15:50.421 --> 1:15:52.381
[water splashing]

1:16:00.097 --> 1:16:02.600
I didn't-- I didn't want you
to get your shoes messy.

1:16:04.852 --> 1:16:08.439
[chuckling]

1:16:09.273 --> 1:16:11.317
You didn't want to get my shoes messy?

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:12.985
I figured you could hold on to them.

1:16:13.069 --> 1:16:16.697
I didn't know you were gonna drop 'em.
I just was trying to save your sh--

1:16:16.781 --> 1:16:20.826
You were trying to save
my shoes. [laughs]

1:16:20.910 --> 1:16:24.955
You don't care about my wedding or
me being happy for the rest of my life--

1:16:25.039 --> 1:16:26.957
I just didn't know what
was gonna happen.

1:16:27.041 --> 1:16:28.167
Ah! Motherfucker!

1:16:28.250 --> 1:16:31.337
Hey. Okay.
You're choking me, man. You're--

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:32.630
-[grunts]
-[panting]

1:16:32.713 --> 1:16:34.006
You're choking me.

1:16:34.090 --> 1:16:35.549
I know exactly what I'm doing.

1:16:35.633 --> 1:16:37.343
Marcus, I'm trained to escape this.

1:16:38.552 --> 1:16:41.180
But I won't. You're my friend. [coughs]

1:16:41.263 --> 1:16:43.265
I think you need
to express your feelings here.

1:16:43.349 --> 1:16:45.142
Feelings? I feel great.

1:16:45.226 --> 1:16:48.187
I feel so good. This the best
I've felt all fucking weekend.

1:16:48.270 --> 1:16:50.815
[choking] Got it. Before you choke me
out, there's something you should know.

1:16:50.898 --> 1:16:51.982
Shut up!

1:16:52.066 --> 1:16:54.944
Back before Mexico, the doctors said
I could never have a baby. [coughs]

1:16:55.027 --> 1:16:57.822
They said I was sterile. [coughs]

1:16:57.905 --> 1:16:58.989
Wait, wait. What?

1:16:59.073 --> 1:17:00.991
I went to see a bunch of specialists.

1:17:01.075 --> 1:17:04.745
Out-of-pocket cost is so damn high
with the deductibles. I should have--

1:17:04.829 --> 1:17:06.497
Get to the fucking point!

1:17:06.580 --> 1:17:09.583
Back in Mexico, Kyla got pregnant.
[coughs]

1:17:09.667 --> 1:17:10.876
And…

1:17:12.211 --> 1:17:14.922
it's because… [coughs] …of you.

1:17:16.841 --> 1:17:18.843
-Oh, God.
-Okay. Passing out.

1:17:19.593 --> 1:17:22.346

1:17:30.604 --> 1:17:31.939

-[chuckling] Hey, everybody.
-[Emily scoffs]

1:17:47.163 --> 1:17:48.539
We-- We need to talk.

1:17:48.622 --> 1:17:51.542
Where have you been?
My brother got back from golf an hour
ago.

1:17:51.625 --> 1:17:54.503
I really need to talk to you
about something, like, right now.

1:17:55.087 --> 1:17:56.130
-Right now?
-Yes.

1:17:56.213 --> 1:18:00.634
So, Kyla's not five months pregnant.
She got pregnant in Mexico.

1:18:00.718 --> 1:18:01.719
So?

1:18:02.553 --> 1:18:03.554
So…

1:18:04.430 --> 1:18:06.348
um… [chuckles]

1:18:06.432 --> 1:18:09.226
…you know that night got a little--
got a little crazy,

1:18:09.310 --> 1:18:12.813
and we never-- we never actually
discussed everything that happened.

1:18:12.897 --> 1:18:14.190
Like what?

1:18:14.773 --> 1:18:18.944
Like, you know, we had sex
in the same room. Me and you.

1:18:19.820 --> 1:18:25.701
But also, it was, like, partners
in the room also having sex.

1:18:25.784 --> 1:18:29.997
But not with their particular partners.

1:18:33.083 --> 1:18:35.294
You understand where
I'm going with this?

1:18:35.377 --> 1:18:37.254
[sighs]

1:18:37.338 --> 1:18:40.299
Yes. I… I know.

1:18:41.759 --> 1:18:42.760
You do?

1:18:43.636 --> 1:18:47.264
I know exactly what happened.
I was there, Marcus.

1:18:47.848 --> 1:18:49.016
[door opens]

1:18:49.099 --> 1:18:51.560
[chattering]

1:18:51.644 --> 1:18:53.229
Uh…

1:18:53.312 --> 1:18:54.313
Baby, is that Zeke?

1:18:57.107 --> 1:18:59.318
And Enzo and Fred.

1:19:00.402 --> 1:19:01.987
Who the hell are these people?

1:19:02.071 --> 1:19:03.113
Surprise!

1:19:03.197 --> 1:19:04.198
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:19:04.281 --> 1:19:06.700
What the hell you doing here?
Matter of fact, why you not at work?

1:19:06.784 --> 1:19:09.453
Nice place, boss. Yeah, I would not
have let us come to this either.

1:19:09.536 --> 1:19:11.413
But we do appreciate the invitation.

1:19:11.497 --> 1:19:13.624
What you mean "invitation"?
I didn't invite you. Who--

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:15.668
Who did invite you?

1:19:15.751 --> 1:19:17.294
[Ron] Uh, ladies and gentlemen…

1:19:17.378 --> 1:19:19.004
Good evening everyone, and welcome.

1:19:19.088 --> 1:19:20.923
-[giggles]
-[shaman chanting]

1:19:21.006 --> 1:19:22.424
What is he doing up there?

1:19:22.508 --> 1:19:25.469
Captain, uh, permission to say a few
words about the happy couple?

1:19:25.552 --> 1:19:26.595
[chuckles]

1:19:26.679 --> 1:19:29.556
Hello, everyone.
I'm Ron. I'm Marcus's <i>suku'un</i>.

1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:32.434
Of course, you wouldn't know that if you
saw him choking me in the street earlier.

1:19:32.518 --> 1:19:34.103
-The fuck is he talking 'bout?
-Shh.

1:19:34.186 --> 1:19:37.106
Marcus. Bet you're surprised
to see your pals from work, huh?

1:19:37.189 --> 1:19:39.692
When I heard Kyla and I were
your only close friends here,

1:19:39.775 --> 1:19:41.610
I called Parker Construction myself,

1:19:41.694 --> 1:19:45.155
and I told them,
"You better get your butts on a plane!"

1:19:45.239 --> 1:19:46.323
'Cause let's face it,

1:19:46.907 --> 1:19:49.660
it's times like these when you want
your closest friends by your side.

1:19:49.743 --> 1:19:52.246
I was best man for my army pal,
Charlie Anderton.

1:19:52.329 --> 1:19:53.998
Man, Charlie and I are super close.

1:19:54.081 --> 1:19:56.834
Like, I talk to him every day.

1:19:57.418 --> 1:20:00.254
Never in my life did I think
I'd have another friend like Charlie.

1:20:02.006 --> 1:20:05.092
And then Marcus and I crossed paths
in Mexico, and I know. I know.

1:20:05.175 --> 1:20:06.969
I'm not supposed to talk about Mexico.

1:20:07.052 --> 1:20:08.262
[chuckles]

1:20:08.345 --> 1:20:12.391
It was just that moment where
Emily and Marcus became like family

1:20:12.474 --> 1:20:13.976
to Kyla and me.

1:20:14.059 --> 1:20:17.813
But little did we know just how much
like family we would become.

1:20:19.273 --> 1:20:21.025
-Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Kyla.
-[chuckles]

1:20:21.108 --> 1:20:24.486
Thank you, baby.
Isn't he so cute, you guys?

1:20:24.570 --> 1:20:29.033
Don't you wanna bake him at 350
till his skin gets crispy?

1:20:29.116 --> 1:20:30.117
[giggles] I do.

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:32.411
Um, as you can see,
I'm currently with child,

1:20:32.494 --> 1:20:35.956
which is, like, actually insane
because Ron and I were told that kids,

1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:38.042
like, weren't gonna be
in the cards for us.

1:20:38.125 --> 1:20:41.503
Without going into too much detail,
it was a semen issue.

1:20:41.587 --> 1:20:44.340
You know what I mean?
So for us, he could shoot far.

1:20:44.423 --> 1:20:45.841
Not like my friend Sue's husband

1:20:45.924 --> 1:20:48.218
who it kinda trickles off the top
of the dick like a waterfall.

1:20:48.302 --> 1:20:50.387
No, when he shoots, he shoots fast.

1:20:50.471 --> 1:20:52.806
He shoots hard.
He shoots, like, a straight shot.

1:20:52.890 --> 1:20:57.102
So it's more kind of like what's in
the shots that's the problem. [chuckles]

1:20:57.186 --> 1:21:00.356
Anyway, Larry and Nancy, rest assured.

1:21:00.439 --> 1:21:04.151
Because even if these two choose
to not have kids of their own,

1:21:04.234 --> 1:21:06.236
your legacy is alive and well

1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:10.741
and kicking right here inside of me
in my fertile womb.

1:21:10.824 --> 1:21:13.619
-This is what I was trying to tell you.
-What are you talking about?

1:21:13.702 --> 1:21:17.706
But something super magical happened
when we were in Mexico.

1:21:17.790 --> 1:21:22.419
And, Marcus, you are destined to play a
really important part in our child's life.

1:21:23.045 --> 1:21:27.716
I am so excited to announce
to all of you that this baby is--

1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:28.926
Is mine!

1:21:29.009 --> 1:21:30.803
-It's mine.
-[guests gasping, murmuring]

1:21:30.886 --> 1:21:36.767
The baby she's carrying…
It's my-- It's my baby.

1:21:39.103 --> 1:21:40.145
[whispering] I'm confused.

1:21:40.229 --> 1:21:43.857
I was taught by them to step up
and do what's right, and I'm doing it.

1:21:43.941 --> 1:21:45.317
Pass me the wine.

1:21:45.401 --> 1:21:48.987
Me and Emily took a trip to Mexico
where we met these two.

1:21:49.071 --> 1:21:53.409
And, uh, one night, we got really drunk.

1:21:53.492 --> 1:21:58.664
Like, like insanely drunk,
like really fucked up.

1:21:58.747 --> 1:22:04.294
I was toe up, and things got
a little, um… a little weird.

1:22:06.171 --> 1:22:09.925
Sexually. It got sexually weird.

1:22:10.008 --> 1:22:15.514
Which led to me unintentionally,
'cause it wasn't my intentions to do this,

1:22:15.597 --> 1:22:18.725
I unintentionally gave this woman a baby.

1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:21.186
So now she's carrying my child.

1:22:21.854 --> 1:22:24.648
It is what it is. That's my baby.

1:22:26.984 --> 1:22:28.527
Actually, no.

1:22:30.737 --> 1:22:35.075
We just wanted to share with you
that it's a boy,

1:22:36.076 --> 1:22:38.704
and we're gonna name him Marcus
in your honor.

1:22:38.787 --> 1:22:43.292
You're not the father.
He's not the father. I am. [chuckles]

1:22:44.543 --> 1:22:46.336
I've been trying
to tell you that all week.

1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:50.716
Okay, in Mexico, remember? I was gonna
run and jump off the cliff into the water.

1:22:50.799 --> 1:22:53.302
-You're like, "Don't cover your balls."
-Yeah. So?

1:22:53.385 --> 1:22:55.804
Yeah, so, the impact from the jump, like,

1:22:56.722 --> 1:22:58.599
knocked the eight ball back
in the corner pocket.

1:22:58.682 --> 1:23:01.435
'Cause now-- now my balls work, man.

1:23:02.811 --> 1:23:04.438
My balls work because of you.

1:23:07.774 --> 1:23:09.276
So, that's not my baby?

1:23:09.943 --> 1:23:11.069
-No.
-No.

1:23:11.153 --> 1:23:13.447
[whispering] Yeah. It's not.

1:23:13.530 --> 1:23:14.531
Sorry.

1:23:21.413 --> 1:23:23.165
[Marcus clears throat, smacks lips]

1:23:24.124 --> 1:23:29.671
I believe that the food choices are
between the fish

1:23:30.672 --> 1:23:32.508
and-- and the beef.

1:23:32.591 --> 1:23:35.093
-Yeah.
-I hear they're both really tasty.

1:23:35.969 --> 1:23:38.805
-Did you cheat on my daughter?
-Captain, hold on.

1:23:38.889 --> 1:23:41.433
Answer me.
Did you have sex with that woman?

1:23:41.517 --> 1:23:43.560
I'm honestly very confused right now.

1:23:43.644 --> 1:23:45.729
-No, Daddy, he didn't.
-How would you know?

1:23:46.730 --> 1:23:47.814
I just do, okay?

1:23:47.898 --> 1:23:49.483
No! How would you know?

1:23:49.566 --> 1:23:51.401
-Because I did.
-[guests gasp]

1:23:51.485 --> 1:23:54.780
It's true. She did. It was hot.

1:23:54.863 --> 1:23:57.282
I can vouch. [chuckles] Super hot.

1:23:57.366 --> 1:23:59.701
This is the best wedding
I've ever been to.

1:24:00.285 --> 1:24:01.453
Seriously?

1:24:01.537 --> 1:24:04.498
You-- You will never marry my daughter.

1:24:04.581 --> 1:24:06.041
What have you done to her?

1:24:06.124 --> 1:24:08.252
-He didn't do anything to me, Dad.
-[Gabe] Enough!

1:24:08.335 --> 1:24:09.545
Move.

1:24:09.628 --> 1:24:11.296
Sis, you're not thinking straight, okay?

1:24:11.380 --> 1:24:13.340
Look, it's obvious to
everyone besides you

1:24:13.423 --> 1:24:15.759
that you're marrying some loser
who's only bringing you down.

1:24:15.842 --> 1:24:17.094
Yo, who you talkin' about?

1:24:17.177 --> 1:24:18.720
I am talking about you.

1:24:18.804 --> 1:24:21.598
You're utterly beneath her.
You have trash friends, a trash job.

1:24:21.682 --> 1:24:23.600
And you wanna know
why? Because you are--

1:24:23.684 --> 1:24:25.060
-What?
-[screams]

1:24:25.811 --> 1:24:26.645
Shit.

1:24:26.728 --> 1:24:28.397
-Well.
-[chuckling] Okay.

1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:30.357
[man yodeling]

1:24:31.066 --> 1:24:32.776
Look what you made me do again.

1:24:32.859 --> 1:24:34.820
Marcus. You give me back those rings.

1:24:34.903 --> 1:24:36.905
-Just give me back those damn rings.
-Oh, my--

1:24:36.989 --> 1:24:39.157
Guess what, Harold.
It's not gonna happen.

1:24:39.241 --> 1:24:40.993
You know why? Because the rings…

1:24:42.327 --> 1:24:44.413
the rings are in the, um…

1:24:45.539 --> 1:24:46.790
in the sewer.

1:24:46.873 --> 1:24:48.333
[Emily's mother gasps]

1:24:48.417 --> 1:24:50.085
[guests murmuring]

1:24:50.168 --> 1:24:51.169
My rings?

1:24:51.253 --> 1:24:53.088
Marcus. [sighs] Marcus.

1:24:54.381 --> 1:24:57.342
-Is this who you want to marry?
-Not right now, Mom.

1:24:57.426 --> 1:24:58.719
I'm gonna kick your ass, man.

1:24:58.802 --> 1:25:00.929
Slow down, playboy.
Nobody's kicking anybody's ass.

1:25:01.013 --> 1:25:02.180
[grunts]

1:25:02.264 --> 1:25:03.765
-Yo.
-[grunts]

1:25:03.849 --> 1:25:05.142
[clamoring]

1:25:05.225 --> 1:25:07.603
[Kyla] Ron! Oh, my God! You guys!

1:25:12.649 --> 1:25:16.278
[Kyla] Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!

1:25:16.361 --> 1:25:18.488
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1:25:18.572 --> 1:25:20.240
[grunts] So sorry.

1:25:25.912 --> 1:25:27.581
[grunts] Sorry.

1:25:28.165 --> 1:25:30.584
-You think the bar's still open?
-Mmm.

1:25:32.294 --> 1:25:36.715
Marcus. Marcus, wait. Wait, baby.

1:25:36.798 --> 1:25:39.217
Baby, why didn't you just tell me
you slept with Kyla?

1:25:39.301 --> 1:25:42.596
[sighs] I don't know, okay.
Everything was just so weird.

1:25:42.679 --> 1:25:44.473
And like you said, we were all so drunk.

1:25:44.556 --> 1:25:48.018
It's no excuse, but it's not like you were
rushing to tell me you slept with her too.

1:25:48.101 --> 1:25:50.103
-But I didn't sleep with her.
-But you thought you did.

1:25:50.187 --> 1:25:52.898
-Yeah, 'cause she was on top of me.
-No. We were on top of you.

1:25:52.981 --> 1:25:54.274
You were not involved.

1:25:54.358 --> 1:25:55.776
-[Kyla] Almost.
-What are we doing?

1:25:55.859 --> 1:25:58.445
[Kyla] You okay?
That was scary, right? Now…

1:25:58.528 --> 1:25:59.446
What the hell?

1:26:00.447 --> 1:26:03.200
Three, two times a day.
Down the hatch. Now swallow it down.

1:26:03.283 --> 1:26:05.369
-Get it down.
-Hey. Look. What are you doing?

1:26:05.452 --> 1:26:06.912
-What?
-What?

1:26:07.579 --> 1:26:11.333
I knew it. Dr. Adolphus. You've been
giving her pills this whole time?

1:26:11.416 --> 1:26:13.460
She's in so much pain.
I'm just helping her manage it.

1:26:13.543 --> 1:26:14.836
-[Emily] Oh, my God.
-What the fuck, Kyla?

1:26:14.920 --> 1:26:17.464
-What?
-She's old. She could OD.

1:26:17.547 --> 1:26:19.758
-Grandma, spit it out.
-Hey, guys.

1:26:19.841 --> 1:26:21.927
-[coughing]
-Grandma, Grandma. Spit it out.
Grandma.

1:26:22.010 --> 1:26:23.387
Spit it out, Grandma! Grandma.

1:26:23.470 --> 1:26:24.638
I feel like I missed something.

1:26:24.721 --> 1:26:26.181
You know what? Just try and swallow--

1:26:26.264 --> 1:26:28.892
Come here!
You had no right to give her drugs.

1:26:28.975 --> 1:26:32.312
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, babe.
They're not drugs. They're herbs.

1:26:32.396 --> 1:26:34.690
Dr. Adolphus--
No, he's a homeopathic doctor.

1:26:34.773 --> 1:26:37.109
Bullshit.
You said he got in trouble with the law.

1:26:37.192 --> 1:26:38.735
Yeah, for selling raw milk.

1:26:38.819 --> 1:26:40.737
Oregon's just not as liberal
as people think.

1:26:40.821 --> 1:26:42.864
Whatever. The fact is, that's my grandma.

1:26:42.948 --> 1:26:44.491
You should not have been
giving her anything.

1:26:44.574 --> 1:26:46.076
[Marcus] That's the
problem with you two.

1:26:46.159 --> 1:26:48.245
Y'all love poking your noses
in other people's shit.

1:26:48.328 --> 1:26:49.454
Marcus, that's not true.

1:26:49.538 --> 1:26:50.664
Oh, it's not true?

1:26:50.747 --> 1:26:55.085
So, why would you invite my coworkers
to a wedding without asking me?

1:26:55.168 --> 1:26:57.879
Why did you pawn my rings? You didn't
ask me if we wanted to do that either.

1:26:57.963 --> 1:27:02.426
Or why would you put cocaine in the
drinks of people you don't even know?

1:27:02.509 --> 1:27:06.471
Because I would want people to put
cocaine in my drink if they just met me.

1:27:06.555 --> 1:27:08.181
We were just trying to be nice.

1:27:08.265 --> 1:27:11.143
"Trying to be nice"
just blew up my fucking wedding!

1:27:11.226 --> 1:27:12.144
[Marcus] This the crazy part.

1:27:12.227 --> 1:27:14.646
We have no idea why you're here
'cause we didn't even invite you.

1:27:14.730 --> 1:27:16.481
Marcus, we're here
because we're your friends.

1:27:16.565 --> 1:27:19.151
Friends? You think we're friends?

1:27:19.234 --> 1:27:20.986
We're not friends, okay!

1:27:21.069 --> 1:27:25.198
We were just vacation friends
for one week in Mexico!

1:27:25.282 --> 1:27:27.284
We didn't plan on
seeing y'all again, at all!

1:27:27.367 --> 1:27:29.536
That's why I didn't give you
my phone number!

1:27:31.538 --> 1:27:33.749
Okay, look. It's been an emotional night--

1:27:33.832 --> 1:27:35.250
Emotional? Let me say this to you.

1:27:35.333 --> 1:27:38.462
Your friend Charlie probably was able
to put up with your bullshit,

1:27:38.545 --> 1:27:41.298
but I'm gonna tell you something,
we had enough.

1:27:41.381 --> 1:27:42.382
We're done.

1:27:42.466 --> 1:27:44.843
So do us a favor
and float the fuck outta here.

1:27:51.057 --> 1:27:52.058
Kyla.

1:28:06.072 --> 1:28:07.783
Uh, baby, it had to be done.

1:28:08.867 --> 1:28:10.952
Yeah. They-- They had it--
They had it coming.

1:28:12.496 --> 1:28:13.747
-Yeah.
-Right?

1:28:14.748 --> 1:28:16.041
Yeah.

1:28:16.124 --> 1:28:17.834
Grandma, let me get you back inside.

1:28:21.963 --> 1:28:23.965
[birds chirping]

1:28:25.300 --> 1:28:29.513
[sighs] Oh, Emily says
Harold is still missing.

1:28:29.596 --> 1:28:31.473
He was gone the whole night?

1:28:31.556 --> 1:28:34.559
-You think your employees whupped his
ass? -[Nancy] Oh, stop.

1:28:34.643 --> 1:28:37.062
Dad, no, okay. My employees wouldn't…

1:28:40.273 --> 1:28:42.609
-Nah, you-- you're being ridiculous.
-[door opens]

1:28:42.692 --> 1:28:43.735
[laughing]

1:28:43.819 --> 1:28:46.029
There he is. The man of the hour.

1:28:46.112 --> 1:28:47.614
Are y'all drinking already?

1:28:47.697 --> 1:28:49.032
We still going from last night.

1:28:49.115 --> 1:28:51.076
Yeah, man.
Your wedding just gets better and better.

1:28:51.159 --> 1:28:52.911
Well, I'm glad you enjoying yourself,

1:28:52.994 --> 1:28:56.164
but, honestly, I don't think
we gonna have a wedding anymore.

1:28:56.248 --> 1:28:58.083
-Do we get the Hennessy back?
-Mmm.

1:28:58.166 --> 1:29:00.001
What are you talking about?
It's happening.

1:29:00.085 --> 1:29:01.336
-Says who?
-[door opens]

1:29:02.587 --> 1:29:04.089
Says this asshole.

1:29:04.172 --> 1:29:06.591
[all laughing]

1:29:06.675 --> 1:29:07.676
[Marcus] Harold?

1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:10.846
How are ya? Marcus. How you doing?

1:29:10.929 --> 1:29:12.931
Okay, look, man. Where have you been?

1:29:13.014 --> 1:29:15.934
-[chuckles]
-Well, I've been with these fools.

1:29:16.017 --> 1:29:17.894
It's an old army tradition.

1:29:17.978 --> 1:29:21.064
When you punch a man,
you have to buy him a beer.

1:29:21.147 --> 1:29:22.190
And we started drinking.

1:29:22.274 --> 1:29:25.277
[together] And drinking
and drinking and drinking.

1:29:26.236 --> 1:29:30.198
And while we were drinking, the boys told
me about what it was like to work for
you.

1:29:31.324 --> 1:29:35.829
They said, "Oh, Marcus.
Marcus is so-- so demanding,

1:29:35.912 --> 1:29:38.790
so-- so uncompromising."

1:29:38.874 --> 1:29:42.794
I must admit,
it does sound like someone I know.

1:29:42.878 --> 1:29:44.004
[chuckles]

1:29:44.087 --> 1:29:49.551
Then they told me
why your last marriage ended.

1:29:50.385 --> 1:29:51.386
Is that right?

1:29:51.970 --> 1:29:55.891
They said, your wife, she didn't wanna
go along with the sacrifices

1:29:55.974 --> 1:29:58.059
that you made when the recession hit.

1:30:00.228 --> 1:30:01.646
And they told me that…

1:30:02.898 --> 1:30:04.316
[sighs]

1:30:04.399 --> 1:30:09.654
…that you paid for
all of your employees, every man,

1:30:09.738 --> 1:30:11.990
out of your own pocket.

1:30:12.949 --> 1:30:14.451
Came back strong, though.

1:30:14.534 --> 1:30:16.286
Thirty-five mil in revenue last year.

1:30:16.369 --> 1:30:18.371
It's right there on the spreadsheet.

1:30:18.455 --> 1:30:23.335
I admit, I haven't held you
in the highest esteem.

1:30:24.252 --> 1:30:26.379
But you're a good businessman, Marcus.

1:30:27.047 --> 1:30:31.676
But more important, you are a good man.

1:30:33.553 --> 1:30:36.848
[chuckles] Wow. This means a lot, Harold.
I really appreciate--

1:30:36.932 --> 1:30:39.559
[all laughing]

1:30:40.268 --> 1:30:44.230
Yes. And to think,
I would never known any of this

1:30:44.314 --> 1:30:46.775
if you hadn't invited these boys.

1:30:47.359 --> 1:30:50.195
But, no. I mean, I actually
didn't even invite them. [chuckles]

1:30:51.780 --> 1:30:52.781
Ron did.

1:30:53.490 --> 1:30:54.491
Huh.

1:30:55.784 --> 1:30:57.118
Where is Ron?

1:30:58.119 --> 1:31:01.039
Hi, sweetie. Got a minute?

1:31:01.122 --> 1:31:05.043
Grandma. I'm sorry about last night.
[sighs]

1:31:05.126 --> 1:31:08.463
You mean when you stuck your hand
down my throat. [chuckles]

1:31:08.546 --> 1:31:10.799
-It happens.
-Does it?

1:31:10.882 --> 1:31:12.467
Whoa, whoa.

1:31:12.550 --> 1:31:13.718
You can walk.

1:31:13.802 --> 1:31:17.097
That pill Kyla gave me really works.

1:31:17.180 --> 1:31:18.848
-Seriously? The herbs?
-Yeah.

1:31:18.932 --> 1:31:22.018
And it doesn't make me sleepy
like my usual pill.

1:31:22.936 --> 1:31:25.480
Oh, she's a sweet girl.

1:31:25.563 --> 1:31:27.148
Yeah, she…

1:31:28.942 --> 1:31:30.402
She's something. [sighs]

1:31:30.485 --> 1:31:32.946
I'm sorry you two had a falling out.

1:31:33.947 --> 1:31:36.366
But she did leave a wedding gift for you.

1:31:40.578 --> 1:31:47.460
"Emily, you're the sister I never had
because my real sister is a B-I-T-C-H.

1:31:47.544 --> 1:31:51.131
I guess it doesn't work to spell out
bad words when you're writing.

1:31:51.214 --> 1:31:52.549
And meeting Marcus…"

1:31:54.926 --> 1:31:57.595
"And meeting Marcus
has brought Ron back to life.

1:31:58.847 --> 1:31:59.848
You wouldn't know it,

1:31:59.931 --> 1:32:03.727
but he's been in a shit ton of pain
since he lost his best friend, Charlie.

1:32:04.894 --> 1:32:07.772
When Charlie died,
half of Ron died with him.

1:32:08.606 --> 1:32:10.859
Or at least it did
until you guys came along.

1:32:10.942 --> 1:32:13.611
I'm sorry we cocked up
your whole weekend.

1:32:13.695 --> 1:32:17.157
To make up for it,
Ron spent all morning getting these back.

1:32:17.240 --> 1:32:20.910
PS: I'd wash them
before you put them on."

1:32:28.043 --> 1:32:29.669
[sighs, scoffs]

1:32:30.462 --> 1:32:31.921
We messed up, Marcus.

1:32:32.005 --> 1:32:33.465
Yeah.

1:32:33.548 --> 1:32:34.591
We gotta find them.

1:32:34.674 --> 1:32:37.761
I don't know how we gonna do that.
Look, we ain't got a phone number on
'em.

1:32:37.844 --> 1:32:40.430
-Shit, I don't even know where they
went. -[sighs]

1:32:46.895 --> 1:32:49.481
[Emily] It should be close.
She said it was right down the block.

1:32:50.148 --> 1:32:52.650
Nope. [panting]
Damn, baby, you know there's a--

1:32:52.734 --> 1:32:54.903
there's a hundred Waffle Houses
in Atlanta.

1:32:54.986 --> 1:32:58.948
So then we'll just work our way up
from here in concentric circles.

1:32:59.032 --> 1:33:01.117
Classic circle sweep maneuver.

1:33:26.142 --> 1:33:27.268
Got a feeling that's them.

[chattering]

1:33:30.021 --> 1:33:32.273
[breathing heavily]
I'm so glad we found you guys.

1:33:32.982 --> 1:33:36.277
Mmm. Well, isn't this
an unhappy coincidence, huh, babe?

1:33:36.361 --> 1:33:38.822
There's a Waffle House
right across the street.

1:33:40.073 --> 1:33:41.908
-You should go eat at that one.
-[Marcus] Look, guys.

1:33:41.991 --> 1:33:44.119
I know we said
some pretty shitty stuff last night.

1:33:44.202 --> 1:33:47.330
-Yeah, shitty, untrue stuff.
-And you right, and we were out of line.

1:33:47.413 --> 1:33:49.457
Yeah.
You guys are not just vacation friends.

1:33:49.541 --> 1:33:51.960
You're real friends,
and we should have treated you like that.

1:33:52.043 --> 1:33:54.170
So, please come--
come back to the wedding.

1:33:55.171 --> 1:33:57.006
I can't get married without my best man.

1:33:57.090 --> 1:33:59.843
Pretty words. How do
we know you mean 'em?

-Fuck that.
-Kyla.

1:34:20.864 --> 1:34:22.323
[Kyla] Ron, you heard them.

1:34:22.407 --> 1:34:25.243
They were, like, accusing me
of giving drugs to people.

1:34:26.494 --> 1:34:28.288
-You-- You did.
-Only the good kind.

1:34:28.371 --> 1:34:30.123
Right. They were homeopathic.

1:34:30.206 --> 1:34:32.333
No, I'm talking about the cocaine.

1:34:33.126 --> 1:34:35.545
It was really, really good cocaine.

1:34:37.589 --> 1:34:38.590
No, honey.

1:34:39.966 --> 1:34:40.967
It was great cocaine.

1:34:41.593 --> 1:34:43.386
[crying] Thank you. I love you.

1:34:44.512 --> 1:34:46.431
[Ron] They did come
all the way down here.

1:34:51.477 --> 1:34:52.854
That's huge.

1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:56.983
Okay. We will come to your wedding,

1:34:57.066 --> 1:34:58.818
but you have to promise
to do something for me.

1:34:59.569 --> 1:35:00.862
Sure. What-- What is it?

1:35:00.945 --> 1:35:06.117
You both have to promise
that you will come to ours.

1:35:13.875 --> 1:35:17.462
Well, Ron and I wanna do
what's best for Marcus.

1:35:17.545 --> 1:35:19.214
Why do y'all wanna do
what's best for me?

1:35:19.297 --> 1:35:21.466
No, Marcus… Marcus.

1:35:22.258 --> 1:35:24.385
Our son who
we're literally naming after you.

1:35:24.469 --> 1:35:27.013

I promise we'll be there.

Yeah.
So, where you guys thinking of having it?
