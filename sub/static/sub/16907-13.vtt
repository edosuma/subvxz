00:02.044 --> 00:03.796
<i>My name is
Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.961 --> 00:05.214
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.380 --> 00:08.884
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.051 --> 00:11.270
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.428 --> 00:13.726
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:13.889 --> 00:15.687
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

00:15.849 --> 00:18.022
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:20.438
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:21.146 --> 00:22.398
Previously on Arrow...

00:22.564 --> 00:24.032
- You want to help?
- Yeah.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.740
- Stay off the streets.
- It's my city, too.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.329
I came here to work with the guy
who killed Damien Darhk.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.786
- So, you ex-Navy, right?
- Dishonorably discharged.

00:31.949 --> 00:35.670
- Reason?
- Because I screwed up. Again.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.622
That's my life, man.

00:38.789 --> 00:41.633
I'm wearing this suit again
because I think it's a path to redemption.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.294
And it could be for you, too.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.555
Look, finding a new Black Canary
isn't just about reviewing resumes.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.057
<i>Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.</i>

00:49.216 --> 00:51.310
She's a kickass woman
who appears out of nowhere

00:51.468 --> 00:52.560
<i>and saves crime victims.</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:53.720
She even has a cry.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.185
<i>Our Tina is trying
to avenge her former partner.</i>

00:59.601 --> 01:02.150
How do you keep living with so much pain?

01:02.312 --> 01:04.155
I can tell you
it helps to not be alone.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.567
My real name is Dinah. Dinah Drake.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.141
I've got something!

01:39.308 --> 01:41.731
Well, not "something" something,
but something.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.523
That's good work.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.901
Didn't know they taught bo staff
at the Central City Police Academy.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.865
They don't. My first undercover assignment

01:51.028 --> 01:53.372
was with a street gang
called the Pilgrims.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.873
They liked to mess around with it.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.539
- I'm gonna head home.
- Yeah.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.123
You found a place to stay already?

01:59.578 --> 02:02.206
No, I'm, uh, just staying
where you guys put me up.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.000
HIVE? That's not a home.
It's barely livable.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.465
It's fine. I don't need much.

02:08.836 --> 02:09.883
See you, man.

02:11.757 --> 02:12.883
What've you guys got?

02:13.050 --> 02:15.894
Well, I have been working on a location
for Claybourne's mistress.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.851
Prometheus' mother, we find her...

02:18.013 --> 02:20.015
We find the name for this son of a bitch.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.526
Unfortunately, the son of a bitch's
father went dark

02:22.684 --> 02:24.732
after he met with the pointy head
of an arrow four years ago,

02:24.895 --> 02:26.363
and Mommy went off the grid.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.899
- Why would she do that?
- Probably because she knows

02:29.066 --> 02:31.910
that he turned into
a serial-killing psychopath nutjob.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.080
Point being, I have been looking for her
for the past three months,

02:35.238 --> 02:38.412
but whatever witness protection program
she put herself into, it is damn good.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.919
- What changed in three months?
- I've had a breakthrough.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.421
I've narrowed her new home
down to Illinois.

02:42.579 --> 02:46.675
L just need a couple more days
to narrow that down into an address.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.505
- That's fantastic work.
- Thank you.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.390
Curtis is coming in,
he's gonna help with the search.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.186
It's really nice to have you back.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.942
Well, I could say the same to you.

03:04.101 --> 03:07.321
I mean, Hub City and Russia?
You're really racking up those miles.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.605
Lot to catch up on.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.275
Yeah, like you and Susan Williams?

03:13.985 --> 03:18.957
People talk, Ollie.
And, uh, some people vomit a little.

03:19.116 --> 03:22.620
Thea, you're kind of insulting someone
that I'm getting pretty serious about.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.460
Did I mention people vomit a little?

03:25.622 --> 03:27.716
You don't like Susan
because of how she does her job.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.502
She's good at her job
and she's a good person.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.587
So, there.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.173
Uh-huh.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.187
Quentin!

03:42.139 --> 03:43.186
Hey.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.310
- Oh, so good to see you.
- You, too.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.564
God, I saw your interview with
the dragon lady. You nailed it.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.732
Uh, that's his girlfriend
you're talking about there.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.784
Yes. Uh, don't remind me.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.159
What are you doing here?

04:00.866 --> 04:03.335
Are you prosecuting him for something?

04:03.660 --> 04:06.504
Actually, Quentin was just introducing us.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.753
I'm the new Deputy Mayor's assistant.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.217
I, uh, never should've left.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.178
Well, uh, talking of leaving,

04:17.339 --> 04:19.512
I got to get across town
for an alderman meeting.

04:19.843 --> 04:20.935
You need me to come with?

04:21.219 --> 04:25.690
Nice try, but those regulatory forms
are not gonna fill themselves out.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.242
I'm just saying that maybe you could
get Susan Williams to back off.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.161
Bottom line, I'm not comfortable
leveraging a personal relationship

04:46.328 --> 04:47.420
for political gain.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.379
The media's right, man.
You're not much of a politician.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.215
As it is, I'm not comfortable
covering up the circumstances

04:54.377 --> 04:56.050
behind the death of Detective Malone.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.052
- So, maybe if Susan...
- Mr. Mayor!

04:58.215 --> 04:59.216
There's a shooter in the building.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.051
We need to get you to a secure location.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.058
<i>LAURA". Rene Ramirez, you are a dead man.</i>

05:45.428 --> 05:48.523
Zoe's gonna totally kill you
if you guys are late to the game.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.109
What?

05:52.936 --> 05:56.031
No way we'll be late, not the way I drive.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.032
Ooh.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.406
Ooh, okay.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.581
Whoa, what do you think you're doing?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.037
<i>Stadium's in the Glades, babe.</i>

06:07.200 --> 06:09.874
In, like, the worst part
of the worst part of town.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.622
I brought it with me last time I took Zoe.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.091
So, you're admitting you broke the rule?

06:15.458 --> 06:16.801
Kind of what I do, babe.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.463
The only reason I agreed
to let you keep that thing in the house

06:19.629 --> 06:21.677
was because you said we needed it
for home protection.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.343
- Right, but...
- As in, stays in the home.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.646
Now, hurry up. You guys are gonna be late.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.806
I thought we were going as a family.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.855
I have a headache.

06:33.393 --> 06:37.318
Oh, yeah? You taking something stronger
than Aspirin for the headache?

06:38.815 --> 06:40.692
You got something
you wanna say to me, Rene?

06:40.859 --> 06:41.951
Guess I do.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.863
Using again?

06:51.828 --> 06:52.875
We cleared the building.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.506
- Shooter isn't here.
- Alert SCPD and ACU.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.793
Drop a five-block net around City Hall.
Let's get ambulances here immediately.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.632
And has anyone seen my sister?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.799
- Ollie.
- Hey, are you all right? Are you okay?

07:19.314 --> 07:20.406
You're gonna be okay.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.405
Just catch that son of a bitch.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.365
Yeah. Go on.

07:36.665 --> 07:37.712
How many casualties?

07:37.874 --> 07:41.879
There's five dead, 24 injured,
and eight in critical condition.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.342
Bastard was wearing Kevlar,

07:43.505 --> 07:46.634
but I think one of my shots
winged his shoulder with a nine-mil slug.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.056
Might be a good idea
to alert all emergency rooms.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.098
- Do it.
- What were you doing with a gun in here?

07:52.263 --> 07:55.767
Judging by how I tagged the guy,
I got to go with saving people's lives.

07:56.226 --> 07:59.196
Your security detail said the shooter
dropped his primary weapon.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.107
- We need to get it before the police do.
- I took care of it.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.574
This is military-grade hardware.

08:06.736 --> 08:10.240
AR-15 assault weapon.
Fires 5.56 NATO rounds.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.915
It's an M16.
It's literally the same gun as an M16.

08:14.077 --> 08:17.001
Seems like some of Tobias Church's
ordnance got into the wrong hand.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.710
Wronger hands. So...

08:18.873 --> 08:22.298
Not necessarily. It's an AR-15.
It's available on the open market.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.883
In fact, it's the most popular gun
in America.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.092
Land of the free,
home of the incredibly stupid.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.727
We are not having this conversation
now or ever, guys.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.600
- Where are we with the gun?
- Nowhere.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.184
It hasn't been used in any prior crime.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.275
Fingerprints.
Shooter wasn't wearing gloves.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.936
AFIS didn't kick back anything.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.149
I don't think he's ever
been in the system.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.985
Or he was smart enough
to have himself erased from it.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.365
Security cameras.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.525
He knew how to avoid them.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.787
And before he opened fire,
he upgraded to a ski mask.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.164
That looks like a utility jumpsuit.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.408
Forefather Repair,
it went belly-up six years ago.

08:53.575 --> 08:54.667
I ran through the employee list,

08:54.826 --> 08:57.625
but I think our shooter
just bought a uniform off the Internet.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.164
So he could walk into City Hall.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.921
This guy's real good at
covering his tracks, whoever he is.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.459
So, who is he?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.505
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.967
Yeah, that's the guy. Run him through
the system for me, would you?

09:10.133 --> 09:12.181
Hey. This is where you've been.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.271
Good thing I got a look at the shooter
before he put his ski mask on.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.691
I let that son of a bitch
walk right past me.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.352
Hey, you couldn't've known, hoss.

09:20.518 --> 09:21.986
I've been police most of my adult life.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.318
I should've been able
to spot that guy 1,000 yards out.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.983
Hey, don't go there, man, all right?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.694
What happened wasn't your fault.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.662
I heard you got a few shots off.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.289
Yeah, and I would've put him down, too,
if he wasn't wearing body armor.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.200
Listen, weren't you
dishonorably discharged?

09:35.366 --> 09:36.868
Not for my aim, hoss.

09:37.243 --> 09:41.043
My point is it's illegal for someone
such as yourself to carry a firearm.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.958
But it's pretty easy to buy one, though.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.711
Wow.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.722
Am I using again?

09:57.472 --> 09:59.600
How could you even ask me
something like that?

09:59.766 --> 10:02.690
Actually, I've been working up the nerve
to ask you for a while now.

10:07.398 --> 10:10.026
Ever since I found this
taped behind your dresser drawer.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.203
You searched our bedroom?

10:12.362 --> 10:15.081
Yeah, 'cause it looks like
my wife's a freaking junkie!

10:19.536 --> 10:20.537
I just...

10:21.913 --> 10:23.165
I just don't get it.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.091
We got out, Laura.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.547
We got out of the Glades,

10:26.709 --> 10:30.213
and here you are,
bringing it back into our home.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.516
You are the last person
who can get on their high horse.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.019
No matter what I've done,
I've never done drugs

10:36.177 --> 10:38.100
and I've never done it
in our baby girl's home!

10:38.263 --> 10:39.435
Screw you, Rene.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.391
We're gonna be late for the game.

10:41.724 --> 10:42.896
<i>He'!-</i>

10:43.393 --> 10:44.565
Hey, sweetheart.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.481
I'm sorry, Dada and Mommy
were just talking.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.153
You were fighting.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.443
No, we're just talking loudly.

10:51.609 --> 10:55.113
Daddy's just disappointed that
Mommy's not coming with us to the game.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.959
Go get your coat, honey.
It's gonna be cold tonight.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.927
I'm throwing this away.

11:09.919 --> 11:13.173
When I get home,
either there's no more drugs in this house

11:14.424 --> 11:16.051
or there's no more you in this house.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.434
Two of the victims
who were in critical condition

11:23.600 --> 11:24.977
just passed away on the table.

11:25.768 --> 11:26.769
Who?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.773
Kyle in Commerce,
and Paula in Accounting.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.153
Oh...

11:34.152 --> 11:36.075
I need phone numbers
for their next of kin.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.910
I've already emailed them to you.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.959
Look, you are gonna find whoever did this.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.996
I know. I have to.
Before he does it again.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.712
What makes you so sure
this isn't just a one-time thing?

11:47.874 --> 11:50.343
If it was a one-time thing,
he wouldn't have concealed his identity

11:50.501 --> 11:52.549
and he wouldn't have fled the scene.
He's...

11:55.924 --> 11:57.267
Uh, Adrian?

11:57.425 --> 11:58.472
What are you doing?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.103
Can you talk some sense into him, please?

12:00.261 --> 12:02.559
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife, Doris.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.395
- Hi.
- He's gonna get himself killed.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.777
I'm tougher than I look,
and I need to be in the office.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.062
You need to be in bed, Adrian.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.981
- You were shot.
- I'm fine.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.774
You look like you're about to pass out.

12:12.941 --> 12:17.447
Hey, listen, come on, buddy.
Take a seat, at least. Please.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.119
What do we know?

12:26.162 --> 12:27.334
We don't know much.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.250
It was a single shooter.
AR-15 assault rifle.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.260
And it doesn't appear
that I was his primary target

12:33.419 --> 12:36.798
because he just
blasted his way through City Hall.

12:36.965 --> 12:40.014
If he wasn't going after you,
then there's a larger agenda here.

12:40.385 --> 12:43.264
AR-15's are the Bertinelli family's
weapon of choice.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.440
Over 90% of the hits they were
involved in last year used them.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.397
Why would the Bertinellis
target City Hall?

12:49.060 --> 12:51.654
Because your office
oversees the Anti-Crime Unit.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.690
And it is a softer target.

12:54.023 --> 12:57.823
All right, we're gonna look into it
under one condition.

12:57.986 --> 13:01.991
You listen to your wife and you stay here.
Let yourself get better.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.409
Fair?

13:06.327 --> 13:07.374
Fair.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.873
Just stop this guy.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.964
<i>Whoever he is,
he's not in the system.</i>

13:18.298 --> 13:20.892
What if instead of tracking him,
we track the assault weapon?

13:21.050 --> 13:24.054
Rifle. And Oliver took it.
Said he was following up a lead.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.598
There's no gun ownership database
for me to go through, anyway.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.983
Yeah, why wouldn't we want
something like that?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.644
So the government
doesn't know our business, hoss.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.153
Guys, can we please... Just not right now.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.189
I don't have any problem
with your right to bear arms,

13:34.355 --> 13:37.074
so long as it doesn't conflict
with my right to, you know, live.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.406
Are you kidding me?
Look at what we do, man.

13:39.569 --> 13:40.912
Our whole life is violence.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.072
I'm not talking about what we do
to protect the city.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.741
I'm talking about the fact that,
as a black man,

13:44.907 --> 13:47.751
I am three times more likely
to be killed by a gun than you.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.833
- He's got a point, Rene.
- Seriously?

13:50.038 --> 13:51.039
You were a cop, man.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.004
And cops would kind of like it if there
were less people out there with guns.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.259
Not this cop.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.674
I mean, people have a right
to protect themselves.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.297
Dinah Drake.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.014
Hi.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.894
You guys are really serious about
this recruitment drive you got going, huh?

14:05.053 --> 14:07.772
Dinah and I tried to get more information
on the shooting out of ESU.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.931
We struck out.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.567
We started trying to track the shooter
by using the gun,

14:11.726 --> 14:14.775
but then we got a little distracted,
again, with our gun control debate.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.780
- Gun violence debate.
- Here we go again.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.108
- Guys, stop.
- Actually, this could be cathartic,

14:19.275 --> 14:20.276
in light of what's happened...

14:20.443 --> 14:22.411
No, I mean, "Stop, I have something" stop.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.409
What've you got?

14:24.614 --> 14:26.537
- Wait. That...
- That doesn't make sense.

14:28.284 --> 14:33.757
This is the AR-15 assault rifle that was
used in the attack on City Hall!

14:34.374 --> 14:36.217
Which one of your guys did it?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.970
You're crazy. None of my guys would...

14:39.128 --> 14:41.551
Your guys used this exact weapon!

14:41.714 --> 14:44.513
Yeah, but why would we shoot up
the mayor's office?

14:44.717 --> 14:45.969
The ACU.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.515
We'd have to be crazier than you
to go to war with Anti-Crime.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.067
And if any of my guys went off
the reservation like that, I'd know it.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.940
And that man would be dead.

14:56.354 --> 14:59.574
Now, are you gonna let me down,
or shoot me?

15:09.492 --> 15:10.994
Don't move!

15:11.160 --> 15:15.131
L just did you a favor.
One less criminal on the street.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.792
Cold-blooded murder. You're the criminal!

15:17.959 --> 15:24.843
I'm you. The only difference between us
is I use a more efficient weapon.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.105
Arrow?

15:32.682 --> 15:34.684
- Go.
- I've got the name of our shooter.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.853
- Who is he?
- Well, that's the thing.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.772
He's a 44-year-old systems analyst
with no criminal record.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.113
He's absolutely nobody.

15:50.575 --> 15:54.705
James Edlund. Husband and father
of two daughters, ages nine and 11.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.251
Until 16 months ago.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.586
What happened 16 months ago?

15:57.748 --> 15:59.045
Crosspoint Mall shooting.

15:59.667 --> 16:03.012
<i>Coming to you live at the mass
shooting at Crosspoint Mall today.</i>

16:03.880 --> 16:05.348
<i>Edlund lost his whole family.</i>

16:06.257 --> 16:09.431
<i>Online, Edlund was a pretty vocal
proponent of the SCGR.</i>

16:09.719 --> 16:12.893
- What's that?
- It's the Star City Gun Registry.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.559
The previous city leadership shot it down.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.068
No pun intended.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.608
So, City Hall doesn't pass a gun law,

16:19.770 --> 16:23.900
this guy loses his whole family
and then takes revenge.

16:24.692 --> 16:25.739
Where is he now?

16:26.235 --> 16:28.613
That's the thing.
After the funeral, he quit his job

16:28.779 --> 16:29.826
and his house is in foreclosure.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.832
He's between the cracks now.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.618
Well, I mean, he's somewhere.

16:33.784 --> 16:37.129
Ollie, I can't hold them off any longer.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.708
Okay. Quentin,
we have to make a statement.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.172
Share the Edlund information with the SCPD

16:42.335 --> 16:45.259
and then we hit the streets
and we find this guy!

16:48.841 --> 16:50.468
- Eighteen people, by the way.
- What?

16:50.635 --> 16:54.265
The mall shooting. 18 people killed,
12 injured. One's a quadriplegic now.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.682
Look, I know where you're going with this,

16:55.848 --> 16:58.442
but the Feds had an assault weapons
ban for years and it did nothing.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.148
- Actually, it did...
- Sorry, hoss,

17:00.520 --> 17:03.444
but if the bad guys got guns,
then I'm strapping up, too.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.031
Go, go! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Go, go! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

17:09.194 --> 17:12.619
- Yeah! Did you have fun, peanut?
- So awesome. Thanks, Daddy.

17:12.781 --> 17:13.874
Of course.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.121
Daddy?

17:19.497 --> 17:21.295
Everything's fine, sweetheart. Um...

17:21.624 --> 17:25.127
Go get your PJs on and get ready for bed.
I'm gonna go check on Mommy, all right?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.603
At this time, our thoughts and our prayers

17:38.349 --> 17:42.820
are with the injured
and the loved ones of the fallen.

17:44.480 --> 17:48.485
This office is working tirelessly
with the SCPD and the Anti-Crime Unit

17:48.651 --> 17:50.870
to make sure that Mr. Edlund,

17:51.529 --> 17:55.955
the perpetrator
of this heinous act of violence,

17:56.867 --> 18:00.963
is apprehended
and swiftly brought to justice.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.666
I will be taking questions now.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.254
Do you have any comment on rumors
that this shooting was in retaliation

18:07.420 --> 18:10.515
for the preceding administration's failure
to pass a gun control ordinance?

18:10.673 --> 18:14.428
Mr. Edlund is
a clearly disturbed individual,

18:14.594 --> 18:18.315
but I can't comment
on his motivations at this time.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.851
What is your administration's position
on the Star City Gun Registry?

18:24.353 --> 18:26.026
That we will be looking into it further.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.532
What's your administration's
position on gun control?

18:30.067 --> 18:32.195
Er...

18:32.695 --> 18:34.368
We're gonna examine all sides of that.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.532
What is your personal opinion?

18:39.201 --> 18:40.327
That it's complicated.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.213
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but seven of your
staffers are dead

18:43.372 --> 18:44.544
and others severely injured.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.256
Don't you think you owe them
a response beyond "it's complicated"?

18:47.418 --> 18:49.011
I do, I owe it to them.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.058
I don't owe it
to any of you.

18:55.176 --> 18:56.519
We're done here. Thank you.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.100
Okay, well, that probably
could have gone better.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.695
- Vultures. All of them.
- No, I appreciate that, Quentin,

19:05.853 --> 19:08.402
but they're right.
I don't know how to deal with this.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.818
You are dealing with this.
And Edlund, we will find...

19:11.984 --> 19:13.236
And then what? He goes to jail.

19:15.112 --> 19:18.537
Seven people that we lost are still dead.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.005
My mission has always been
to save this city,

19:24.163 --> 19:27.508
and my first instinct has almost
always been to use violence.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.835
You didn't bring this on.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.754
I know. I know.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.885
It's a violent world and sometimes
it only responds to violence,

19:37.051 --> 19:41.807
but we cannot dismiss the idea that we
are just feeding into a vicious cycle.

19:46.769 --> 19:50.694
You ask me, this is a problem
that the Green Arrow can't solve.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.818
<i>I mean, sure, you can find him,
you probably will.</i>

19:54.110 --> 19:55.282
But this...

19:56.821 --> 19:59.791
This is bigger than one nut-bar
with a bag full of guns.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.575
He's right.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.004
The solution here is not with you
as the Green Arrow,

20:05.162 --> 20:06.459
it's with you as the mayor.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.215
I just showed the entire city

20:08.457 --> 20:10.676
that I don't know how to
handle this as the mayor.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.178
So you try again,

20:12.461 --> 20:14.555
and if that doesn't work,
damn it, you try again.

20:15.172 --> 20:18.893
Nobody said being mayor of this city
was ever gonna be easy, Oliver.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.148
We need a list.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.985
Every alderman, councilman
and community leader

20:28.144 --> 20:30.021
that was involved
in the previous gun-control ordinance,

20:30.187 --> 20:33.191
I want them in here,
I want to meet with them today.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.244
We're not gonna solve this right away.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.156
Are you sure that you wanna
open that can of worms?

20:41.991 --> 20:45.996
L just mean that gun control
is a big political third rail, so...

20:46.162 --> 20:48.711
- Thea, come on.
- Thea, I understand.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.883
This shouldn't be about politics.

20:51.208 --> 20:55.805
This should be about safety and security.
Everyone's safety and security.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.715
Whether they own a gun or not.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.385
- Now, let's get to work.
- Okay.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.157
Councilwoman, thank you very much
for meeting with me.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.664
Well, from what I hear,
you've been making the rounds.

21:21.822 --> 21:22.994
Well...

21:23.157 --> 21:25.660
For someone without
a lot of political capital,

21:25.826 --> 21:29.251
you're certainly making an
interesting choice as to how to spend it.

21:29.413 --> 21:32.041
I have seven dead staffers
who wouldn't find it interesting at all.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.051
And it's a terrible thing
that happened here.

21:34.585 --> 21:35.711
It is terrible.

21:36.545 --> 21:40.049
- Police make any progress locating Edlund?
- No, unfortunately.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.014
But they're fairly confident
that he targeted City Hall

21:42.176 --> 21:44.679
because of our inability
to enact the SCGR.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.898
You implying I'm somehow
responsible for what happened?

21:48.057 --> 21:52.312
No. But, Councilwoman,
you did kill the ordinance.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.313
You really have been making the rounds.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.734
Yes. I'm against any registry
that gives the government

21:57.900 --> 22:00.904
the opportunity to keep tabs
on specific sectors of the population.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.164
The DMV keeps a list of driver's licenses.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.041
It's not a constitutional right
to drive a car, Mr. Mayor.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.703
You know, people such as yourself
oppose limitations

22:08.869 --> 22:10.587
on things like abortion,
freedom of speech.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.420
Why is the Second Amendment
somehow less important in your eyes

22:13.582 --> 22:15.300
than the other nine in the Bill of Rights?

22:15.459 --> 22:19.430
Because people are dying, Councilwoman.
Right here in this building!

22:20.965 --> 22:25.937
And there are limitations
on abortion and freedom of speech.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.640
Both of my parents are dead.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.443
My friend Tommy was...

22:33.727 --> 22:36.571
He was one of the 503
killed in the Undertaking.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.941
Laurel Lance was my friend.

22:40.359 --> 22:44.284
Nobody respects the rights
of someone to protect themselves

22:44.530 --> 22:47.409
and the people that they care for,
more than me.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.836
But everything in life
comes with limitations. Everything.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.504
Why are you telling me this?

22:52.663 --> 22:55.758
Because you and I
are gonna sit in this office

22:55.916 --> 22:58.635
until we figure out
a reasonable set of limitations

22:58.794 --> 23:00.796
that respects everyone's rights.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.270
Are you hungry?
Should I order something in?

23:09.138 --> 23:10.481
We might be here a while.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.529
- I don't know anything! I don't...
- Get up! Get up!

23:22.985 --> 23:25.989
I know you've seen this scumbag.
He lives in this neighborhood!

23:26.155 --> 23:28.499
I don't know everybody, dude! I don't!

23:40.085 --> 23:41.257
Another dead end?

23:42.421 --> 23:44.094
Let's just call it a long shot.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.014
I'd be taking out my frustrations
on these lowlifes at this point.

23:48.177 --> 23:49.520
Yeah, it happens.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.937
Let's call it a night, huh?

23:51.347 --> 23:53.395
Get you back to your not-so-homey home.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.184
Seriously, John, it's fine.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.771
Then, I just don't know why
you don't want better for yourself.

24:02.524 --> 24:03.946
There was one place I kind of liked.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.371
It's a studio apartment off Canal.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.667
It had this nice little backyard garden.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.921
I went to go fill out a lease application.
I don't know.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.206
But what?

24:19.041 --> 24:20.384
Nothing. It's stupid.

24:25.214 --> 24:28.559
It asked questions, okay? It asked
questions about the last three years.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.054
Jobs and residencies, that sort of thing.

24:31.220 --> 24:34.565
Yeah, and I guess there was no box
to check for "vendetta." Right?

24:35.599 --> 24:37.727
- Yeah, not so much, no.
- Yeah.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.772
And it's not even just that. I...

24:43.232 --> 24:44.984
You know, just forget it. It's so stupid.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.824
Dinah, I work with Oliver Queen.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.447
Please, try me.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.287
Applying for an apartment is...

24:58.080 --> 24:59.923
It's something normal people do.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.761
I haven't had normal in a very long time.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.345
I don't know
who I'm supposed to be anymore.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.936
I remember I felt that way the first time
I was discharged from Special Services.

25:17.641 --> 25:22.693
But, Dinah, I realized that I don't
have to be anybody. I'm already me.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.738
I guess I had to give myself
permission to get back to that.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.448
And how do you do that, exactly?

25:29.653 --> 25:30.870
It starts with the little things.

25:31.363 --> 25:35.459
Like a small studio apartment
with a garden.

25:37.703 --> 25:38.704
Yeah.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.464
Let's get out of here.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.470
You got something?

25:48.881 --> 25:51.304
- Nothing but strikeouts. You?
- Same.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.101
Isn't Rene back yet?

25:53.469 --> 25:54.516
Nope. Why?

25:54.803 --> 25:56.271
You wanna go a couple more rounds at him?

25:56.430 --> 25:58.103
Why don't you like us talking about this?

25:58.265 --> 26:00.984
L just don't like you guys
arguing while I'm trying to work.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.817
Why not? There's nothing wrong
with a little healthy debate, Felicity.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.731
It's not healthy
if it doesn't accomplish anything,

26:05.898 --> 26:08.276
and it's not going to accomplish anything.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.831
Actually, I disagree.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.785
Not about the part of it
not accomplishing anything,

26:17.951 --> 26:20.329
but this idea that it's not healthy.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.673
We used to talk about things
as a society, you know.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.964
We'd debate and we would argue

26:26.126 --> 26:28.345
and we would still
respect each other after.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.723
Yeah. Somewhere along the line,
that just became...

26:30.964 --> 26:32.341
- Rude.
- Rude. Yeah.

26:32.508 --> 26:35.057
- It became impolitic to talk politics.
- Hmm.

26:35.219 --> 26:37.017
Can't help but wonder that
maybe that's why

26:37.179 --> 26:38.726
our country is the way it is today.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.893
- Got something?
- Maybe.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.193
Name of a support group
Edlund used to be a part of.

26:47.356 --> 26:49.358
Maybe somebody there still knows
how to get in contact with him.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.868
Text Rene the address
and have him meet me there.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.152
Yeah.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.122
I didn't care. It was just a necklace.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.585
But, Steve,
he got in front of the man and...

27:01.328 --> 27:03.956
Every time I close my eyes,
I see the gun.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.332
Every time.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.885
<i>It gets better, Monica.
We get better.</i>

27:09.044 --> 27:12.014
I'm afraid we're out of time for today,
but get some coffee on the way out,

27:12.172 --> 27:14.550
and I sprung for
the good donuts this week.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.343
Thank you.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.066
Hey, man.

27:23.225 --> 27:25.398
Name's Rene Ramirez,
I work for the Deputy Mayor.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.905
- This is my assistant.
- In his dreams. Er...

27:29.398 --> 27:30.741
I mean, yeah, kind of.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.531
Can we ask you some questions
about James Edlund?

27:34.361 --> 27:36.284
Participation in this group
is confidential.

27:36.572 --> 27:37.789
You know what Edlund did?

27:37.948 --> 27:40.747
I watched the mayor's press conference
and I wish I could help,

27:40.909 --> 27:44.880
but you have to understand,
I take confidentiality seriously.

27:45.038 --> 27:48.588
Sir, confidentiality doesn't apply when
there's the possibility of future harm.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.179
Hey, we just want to find this guy
before anyone else gets hurt.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.511
- Why aren't the police doing this?
- Don't worry.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.760
We'll make sure the information
gets to the right people.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.892
I heard he was staying with a friend.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.561
Let me see if I can get you the address.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.603
Felicity said you wanted me here.

28:09.146 --> 28:11.444
Was it 'cause you wanted me
to hear that woman's story?

28:11.773 --> 28:13.946
No. But since you did...

28:14.526 --> 28:16.278
Doesn't change how I feel, man.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.290
Guns save lives. Period.

28:20.616 --> 28:23.836
<i>- You just want to think that.
- No, that's what I know.</i>

28:23.994 --> 28:28.500
'Cause if I had my gun,
my wife would still be alive.

28:30.626 --> 28:33.425
Here you go.
I don't know if it's still good.

28:34.338 --> 28:35.339
Thank you.

28:40.302 --> 28:41.895
I didn't even know you were married.

28:42.471 --> 28:45.600
Not something I like to talk about.
Let's call this in.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.658
Let go! Let...

28:54.983 --> 28:55.984
Get away...

28:56.443 --> 28:59.788
Back off. Your bitch wife here
owes me for her last high.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.917
- Rene.
- Yeah, okay. Okay, fine. How much?

29:03.659 --> 29:05.377
Money's right there in the safe.

29:06.787 --> 29:08.084
Let me hook you up.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.625
- $500.
- No problem.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.181
- Zoe?

29:18.340 --> 29:19.808
Zoe, get back in your room!

29:40.862 --> 29:41.863
Daddy!

29:42.948 --> 29:45.201
- Daddy!
- Sweetheart, are you okay?

29:45.867 --> 29:48.211
Are you all right? Are you okay? Huh?

29:48.704 --> 29:49.796
Mommy!

29:52.040 --> 29:54.213
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

30:07.556 --> 30:08.728
Clear.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.022
But Edlund was here. Look.

30:14.688 --> 30:16.065
This is his family.

30:18.567 --> 30:22.071
Yo, check it out. Floor plan.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.791
He planned out his attacks.

30:26.533 --> 30:30.254
Yeah, but this, this doesn't
match City Hail. This is...

30:31.913 --> 30:33.210
Oh, damn.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.087
I know what he's gonna hit next.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.595
Lam still failing to understand
why a simple registry would...

30:38.754 --> 30:41.348
Okay, first of all,
registries are never simple.

30:41.715 --> 30:45.811
They're bureaucracies, tying up
Second Amendment rights in red tape,

30:45.969 --> 30:48.813
you know, and it's not just
the owners who'll be affected.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.771
It's the sellers who're gonna see
a substantial decline in their businesses.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.776
Well, I don't think that it's unre...

30:56.355 --> 30:57.356
Excuse me.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.111
- Yeah.
- Rene and Curtis found Edlund's crib

31:02.527 --> 31:04.245
and a plan to shoot up Starling General.

31:04.404 --> 31:07.248
Assemble the team, tell Lance
to bring in the ACU. I'm on my way.

31:07.449 --> 31:08.951
I have to go.

31:09.993 --> 31:13.463
- I thought we're staying till we're done.
- I'm terribly sorry, but I have to go.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.469
We're in position. Northeast corner.

31:29.763 --> 31:31.060
I'm on the southwest.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.606
Overwatch?

31:36.269 --> 31:37.316
No sign of the bastard.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.652
But remember, he's good
at avoiding security cameras.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.908
Hey, don't! Don't!
Get out of here. Go, go.

31:49.366 --> 31:50.538
Mommy.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.335
- Don't do this.
- Get back.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.426
You had another chance
to shoot me at City Hall.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.508
You didn't do it.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.850
Because you need me
to enact the Star City Gun Registry.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.311
I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

32:11.513 --> 32:16.394
You wanna punish the city
because we failed to protect your family.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.486
But... Hey, hey!

32:25.986 --> 32:27.158
Mr. Edlund...

32:28.697 --> 32:30.370
I... I checked.

32:31.533 --> 32:33.376
The man who killed your family,

32:35.078 --> 32:37.206
he acquired those guns illegally.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.547
There's nothing that we could've done.
No... No...

32:41.835 --> 32:45.715
No registry would've
helped us protect them.

32:46.548 --> 32:47.549
I know.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.643
I was supposed to protect them.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.772
Isn't that a man's job?
To protect his family?

32:55.557 --> 32:57.025
Isn't that why we have guns?

32:57.476 --> 32:59.945
<i>My wife and daughters were innocent.</i>

33:01.271 --> 33:03.865
- I can understand why you're angry.
- We're all angry!

33:05.066 --> 33:08.411
We're all so angry all the time.

33:10.030 --> 33:11.577
So, why shouldn't I use this?

33:11.990 --> 33:15.244
Why shouldn't I kill everyone?
Put us all out of our damn misery!

33:15.410 --> 33:18.584
Mr. Edlund, that's not your call to make.

33:20.040 --> 33:26.047
Yeah, I mean, people are angry
and we're hurting and we're lashing out

33:26.213 --> 33:29.513
and I can understand that it feels
like it's getting worse every day,

33:29.674 --> 33:32.894
but what you're doing is not the answer!

33:34.262 --> 33:35.684
The people that you hurt,

33:38.099 --> 33:39.817
the seven people that are dead,

33:42.395 --> 33:44.238
my friend, they were innocent, too.

33:48.693 --> 33:49.910
You're right.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.617
And I deserve to be punished.

33:55.784 --> 33:58.253
Hey, hey, hey. Look, James,

33:59.329 --> 34:01.297
you got to think about
your wife and your daughters.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.333
Lam thinking about them.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.798
I know that you want this pain to go away,

34:08.255 --> 34:10.382
and I know that you wanna
be with your family again,

34:10.549 --> 34:12.347
but if you want them to live on,

34:14.010 --> 34:15.478
it has to be through you.

34:17.514 --> 34:18.891
That's the only way.

34:21.560 --> 34:25.155
James, give me the gun.

34:26.313 --> 34:27.315
Please.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.681
When you ran out on me last night,
you neglected to mention

34:55.844 --> 34:57.517
that it was to go
help people at a hospital.

34:57.679 --> 34:58.976
I'm forgetful that way.

34:59.139 --> 35:00.140
Shooter in custody?

35:00.307 --> 35:02.560
DA Chase says that he is
gonna plead guilty to everything.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.570
Councilwoman Pollard,
this is Rene Ramirez.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.606
He works very closely
with Deputy Mayor Lance,

35:07.856 --> 35:12.453
and he is a very, very vocal proponent
of gun ownership rights.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.289
Freedom isn't free.
Not even the freedom to bear arms.

35:16.698 --> 35:20.498
So, Mr. Ramirez and I got together
and came up with this.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.707
What is this?

35:21.953 --> 35:23.705
Citywide gun control ordinances.

35:24.039 --> 35:27.543
Nothing that makes it harder
to buy or own or carry a gun.

35:27.709 --> 35:32.385
It also doesn't prohibit people from
protecting themselves from gun violence.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.724
Okay, I'm gonna back you on this.
If for no other reason

35:37.886 --> 35:40.605
than the optics of fighting this
after what happened are lousy.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.232
There are other reasons,
too, Councilwoman.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.313
But I wanna be
perfectly clear about something.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.354
Not today, not tomorrow, but eventually,

35:47.520 --> 35:49.522
I'm going to extract
a political prize for this.

35:49.689 --> 35:50.861
You can count on that.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.576
Sounds like a yes.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.574
I can live with what you got here.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.203
Good, because living is the whole point.

36:04.204 --> 36:05.421
Just listen...

36:06.790 --> 36:13.093
I messed up, I know that,
but Zoe already lost her mother.

36:14.047 --> 36:16.846
"Unsafe environment"?
What's that even mean?

36:17.092 --> 36:18.309
I'm so sorry.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.352
I'm so sorry.

36:20.929 --> 36:21.930
I, um...

36:22.639 --> 36:24.391
Ma'am, I can get counseling.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.443
L just wanna see my daughter.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.901
Please, I just wanna see her.

36:31.064 --> 36:35.069
Ma'am, ma'am, please don't do that.
Don't hang up the phone on me.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.538
Ma'am, please. Hello? Hello?

36:41.616 --> 36:43.289
Son of a bitch!

36:44.244 --> 36:47.623
<i>Damien Darhk, the man
behind tonight's siege of Star City,</i>

36:47.789 --> 36:51.134
<i>was killed by the masked vigilante
known as the Green Arrow.</i>

36:51.292 --> 36:54.262
<i>Amateur cell phone video
captured this very moment,</i>

36:54.546 --> 36:57.220
<i>putting an end to the chaos
that has gripped the city.</i>

36:57.632 --> 36:58.929
<i>Before Darhk was killed,</i>

36:59.092 --> 37:02.687
<i>the citizens of Star City demonstrated
there is strength in numbers,</i>

37:03.096 --> 37:06.976
<i>as they fought against their attackers
alongside the Green Arrow,</i>

37:07.350 --> 37:08.852
<i>leading Darhk's allies to retreat.</i>

37:30.373 --> 37:32.375
Oh, yo. Can I talk to you for a second?

37:32.667 --> 37:33.839
Yeah. What's up?

37:34.043 --> 37:38.344
I just wanted to apologize for getting
in your face earlier about guns and stuff.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.929
Hoss, do I seem like
I can't handle tough talk?

37:41.092 --> 37:47.600
No, but I didn't know about your wife
and your daughter.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.814
I may have done a little googling.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.196
I don't like to talk about it, man.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.989
I mean, Zoe's in a foster home.

38:02.739 --> 38:04.161
A good one, it looks like.

38:05.408 --> 38:08.332
CPS is right.
She shouldn't be anywhere near me.

38:08.578 --> 38:11.252
I don't agree with that, Rene,

38:12.123 --> 38:13.670
and I have a lawyer friend
who doesn't, either.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.178
How about we get your daughter back?

38:22.717 --> 38:24.264
Hey. Just checking on you.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.059
You, uh, going somewhere?

38:28.640 --> 38:31.063
A studio apartment with a garden.

38:31.351 --> 38:32.477
You applied for the lease.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.733
I got the lease.

38:35.605 --> 38:38.734
Yes. Small steps, huh?

38:39.067 --> 38:42.412
Well, the apartment is not
the only thing I applied for.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.823
- Hmm.
- You're looking at the latest recruit

38:44.989 --> 38:46.457
into the SCPD.

38:46.741 --> 38:50.416
- Congratulations, Detective Drake.
- Thank you.

38:50.578 --> 38:53.001
Well, you did it.
I just gave you a little push.

38:53.915 --> 38:58.546
Well, uh, I needed the push.
So, thank you.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.046
Congrats.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.435
Thank you, all, for being here.

39:06.970 --> 39:09.598
In light of what's happened,
I thought it important

39:10.765 --> 39:15.191
that we gather as a city
and remember those that we've lost.

39:16.771 --> 39:20.150
<i>After everything that Star City
has endured in the past several years,</i>

39:21.442 --> 39:24.537
it would be easy to become immune

39:24.696 --> 39:30.078
or desensitized to the violence
that pervades our lives.

39:30.660 --> 39:35.131
And it would be human to want
to respond to that violence with violence.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.965
When I think of
all the people that I've lost,

39:42.630 --> 39:46.476
I remember the choices that I was forced
to make in light of those tragedies.

39:50.471 --> 39:51.973
Some choices were easy.

39:54.309 --> 39:57.313
But the important choices,
the choices that were worth making,

39:57.478 --> 39:58.525
they were hard.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.984
And hard choices require bravery.

40:02.650 --> 40:06.530
Fortunately, we live
in the home of the brave.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.408
We don't run from hard choices.

40:09.574 --> 40:13.169
We rise up and we face tomorrow together.

40:15.622 --> 40:19.468
This afternoon, Councilwoman Pollard and I

40:20.084 --> 40:25.341
met with the city council to pass
the Star City Firearms Freedom Act,

40:25.548 --> 40:28.176
<i>a policy that respects our freedom</i>

40:30.386 --> 40:31.683
and our lives.

40:35.058 --> 40:36.731
It shows that we can do both.

40:41.731 --> 40:44.530
And now we just have to be
brave enough to do it.
