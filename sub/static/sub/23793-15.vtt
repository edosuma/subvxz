>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.500 --> 00:35.767
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:35.834 --> 00:37.233
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:37.300 --> 00:38.367
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:38.433 --> 00:39.567
US.

00:39.633 --> 00:41.367
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:41.433 --> 00:42.233
THE WEEK, AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT

00:42.300 --> 00:43.567
WITH DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF

00:43.633 --> 00:45.133
THE UNITED STATES AND THE LOVE

00:45.200 --> 00:50.066
OF MELANIA'S LIFE.

00:50.133 --> 00:50.867
TRUMP HAD HIMSELF A BIT OF AN

00:50.934 --> 00:53.800
UP-AND-DOWN TIME THIS WEEK.

00:53.867 --> 00:55.967
ON THE DOWNSIDE, HIS FORMER

00:56.033 --> 00:57.500
LAWYER, MICHAEL COHEN, SOUGHT

00:57.567 --> 00:58.233
NEW COUNSEL, PROMPTING MANY TO

00:58.300 --> 00:58.934
SPECULATE HE'S ABOUT TO FLIP ON

00:59.000 --> 00:59.800
TRUMP.

00:59.867 --> 01:00.400
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

01:00.467 --> 01:01.233
I THINK A RANDOM NEW YORKER

01:01.300 --> 01:06.467
PROBABLY EXPRESSED IT BEST.

01:06.533 --> 01:07.066
>> HEY, IT'S THAT GUY THAT'S

01:07.133 --> 01:09.400
GOING TO JAIL!

01:09.467 --> 01:10.233
AWESOME, WAY TO GO, BUD.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.233
>> John: WHO SAYS NEW YORKERS

01:11.300 --> 01:12.967
AREN'T FRIENDLY?

01:13.033 --> 01:14.734
SURE, WE MIGHT NOT SAY "HELLO"

01:14.800 --> 01:18.667
TO YOU, BUT WE'LL ALWAYS GIVE

01:18.734 --> 01:24.266
YOU A "GOOD LUCK IN THE

01:24.333 --> 01:25.600
BIG HOUSE, YA PIECE OF SHIT,"

01:25.667 --> 01:26.266
WHEN THE SITUATION DEMANDS IT.

01:26.333 --> 01:27.100
BUT TRUMP'S WEEK BEGAN WITH THE

01:27.166 --> 01:28.133
EYES OF THE WORLD ON HIM AS HE

01:28.200 --> 01:28.767
MET WITH THIS CUTIE-PATOOTIE FOR

01:28.834 --> 01:29.166
A HISTORIC SUMMIT.

01:29.233 --> 01:29.967
AND TO LISTEN TO TRUMP, IT WAS A

01:30.033 --> 01:30.900
HUGE SUCCESS.

01:30.967 --> 01:31.600
>> AFTER LANDING AT JOINT BASE

01:31.667 --> 01:32.600
ANDREWS, PRESIDENT TRUMP

01:32.667 --> 01:36.066
TWEETED, "EVERYBODY CAN NOW FEEL

01:36.133 --> 01:36.800
MUCH SAFER THAN THE DAY I TOOK

01:36.867 --> 01:37.667
OFFICE.

01:37.734 --> 01:38.433
THERE IS NO LONGER A NUCLEAR

01:38.500 --> 01:39.500
THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA,"

01:39.567 --> 01:43.133
ADDING, "SLEEP WELL TONIGHT."

01:43.200 --> 01:45.633
>> John: OKAY, SO FOR THE

01:45.700 --> 01:46.467
RECORD ON THAT,

01:46.533 --> 01:47.200
DONALD TRUMP TELLING ME I CAN

01:47.266 --> 01:48.100
SLEEP WELL TONIGHT IS LIKE THE

01:48.166 --> 01:49.266
GRIM REAPER TELLING ME TO HAVE A

01:49.333 --> 01:50.033
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

01:50.100 --> 01:51.700
HIS PRESENCE IS THE REASON I

01:51.767 --> 01:53.100
WILL NOT.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.533
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, THE DEAL

01:54.600 --> 01:55.967
TRUMP MADE WITH KIM JONG UN WAS

01:56.033 --> 01:57.367
PRETTY UNDERWHELMING.

01:57.433 --> 01:58.633
THEY AGREED TO "WORK TOWARD

01:58.700 --> 02:00.300
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

02:00.367 --> 02:02.734
KOREAN PENINSULA," WHICH ISN'T

02:02.800 --> 02:03.867
JUST AMBIGUOUS COMPARED TO THE

02:03.934 --> 02:05.000
MULTIPLE PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS

02:05.066 --> 02:05.934
INVOLVING NORTH KOREA, IT'S ALSO

02:06.000 --> 02:07.166
CLOSE TO MEANINGLESS.

02:07.233 --> 02:08.767
IN FACT, WHAT AMERICA GOT OUT OF

02:08.834 --> 02:10.300
THIS DEAL APPEARS TO BE

02:10.367 --> 02:11.967
SOMETHING OF A TRUMP SPECIALTY,

02:12.033 --> 02:14.000
SOMETHING I'M GOING TO CALL THE

02:14.066 --> 02:15.800
"ICE CREAM BLOWJOB," WHERE HE

02:15.867 --> 02:19.033
ANNOUNCES SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS

02:19.100 --> 02:21.633
GREAT, BUT WHEN YOU REALLY THINK

02:21.700 --> 02:22.533
ABOUT IT, ISN'T ACTUALLY

02:22.600 --> 02:23.500
ANYTHING.

02:23.567 --> 02:24.533
BUT PERHAPS THE GENUINELY

02:24.600 --> 02:25.467
REMARKABLE THING ABOUT THE

02:25.533 --> 02:27.200
SUMMIT WAS THE DEFERENCE TRUMP

02:27.266 --> 02:27.900
HAPPILY SHOWED HIS COUNTERPART,

02:27.967 --> 02:29.266
BECAUSE WHILE DIPLOMACY ALWAYS

02:29.333 --> 02:30.667
INVOLVES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

02:30.734 --> 02:31.633
SUCKING UP TO HORRIBLE PEOPLE,

02:31.700 --> 02:34.734
TRUMP WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.934
>> REALLY, HE'S GOT A GREAT

02:37.000 --> 02:37.800
PERSONALITY.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.367
HE'S A, YOU KNOW, FUNNY GUY,

02:39.433 --> 02:40.433
HE'S A VERY SMART GUY, HE'S A

02:40.500 --> 02:41.533
GREAT NEGOTIATOR.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.500
I THINK HE LIKED ME AND I LIKE

02:42.567 --> 02:44.066
HIM.

02:44.133 --> 02:45.233
HE'S SMART, HE LOVES HIS PEOPLE,

02:45.300 --> 02:46.934
HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY, HE WANTS A

02:47.033 --> 02:47.667
LOT OF GOOD THINGS, AND THAT'S

02:47.734 --> 02:54.133
WHY HE'S DOING THIS.

02:54.200 --> 02:54.767
>> John: OKAY, SO JUST QUICKLY:

02:54.834 --> 02:55.266
NO, HE DOESN'T;

02:55.333 --> 02:55.900
NO, HE ISN'T;

02:55.967 --> 02:56.467
NO, HE'S NOT;

02:56.533 --> 02:57.166
NO, HE ISN'T;

02:57.233 --> 02:57.900
NO, HE DIDN'T;

02:57.967 --> 02:58.567
NO, HE ISN'T;

02:58.633 --> 02:59.300
NO, HE DOESN'T;

02:59.367 --> 03:00.734
NO, HE DOESN'T;

03:00.800 --> 03:01.500
NO, HE DOESN'T;

03:01.567 --> 03:02.433
AND THAT'S NOT WHY HE'S

03:02.500 --> 03:02.967
DOING IT.

03:03.033 --> 03:04.066
AND LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY

03:04.133 --> 03:04.700
THAT PART OF TRUMP'S ADMIRATION

03:04.767 --> 03:07.567
FOR KIM IS THAT HE WISHES HE

03:07.633 --> 03:08.567
COULD BE A DICTATOR AS WELL.

03:08.633 --> 03:09.967
I'M GOING TO LET HIM SAY IT.

03:10.033 --> 03:12.100
>> HE'S THE HEAD OF A COUNTRY.

03:12.166 --> 03:12.700
AND, I MEAN, HE'S THE STRONG

03:12.767 --> 03:13.667
HEAD.

03:13.734 --> 03:14.734
DON'T LET ANYONE THINK ANYTHING

03:14.800 --> 03:16.000
DIFFERENT.

03:16.066 --> 03:16.800
HE SPEAKS AND HIS PEOPLE SIT UP

03:16.867 --> 03:18.066
AT ATTENTION, AND I WANT MY

03:18.133 --> 03:19.200
PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.433
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S

03:20.500 --> 03:21.533
THE PRESIDENT OF THE

03:21.600 --> 03:22.600
UNITED STATES EXPRESSING A WISH

03:22.667 --> 03:23.500
THAT PEOPLE WOULD MODEL

03:23.567 --> 03:24.266
THEMSELVES AFTER THE

03:24.333 --> 03:25.367
MALNOURISHED POPULATION OF

03:25.433 --> 03:28.266
NORTH KOREA.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.700
NOW, MAYBE HE JUST MEANT

03:31.767 --> 03:33.200
THAT WHITE HOUSE STAFF SHOULD

03:33.266 --> 03:34.000
SIT UP, MAYBE HE MEANT EVERYONE.

03:34.066 --> 03:34.700
BUT EITHER WAY, IT'S CLEAR THAT

03:34.767 --> 03:35.900
THE PRESIDENT WISHES HE WAS A

03:35.967 --> 03:36.967
DICTATOR, WHICH IS A DIRE

03:37.033 --> 03:38.166
REALIZATION, RIGHT UP THERE WITH

03:38.233 --> 03:39.533
"THE ROBOTS HAVE BECOME

03:39.600 --> 03:40.867
SENTIENT" OR "THE CAT HAS

03:40.934 --> 03:46.066
POWER OF ATTORNEY."

03:46.133 --> 03:46.633
WOW, HOW THE FUCK DID WE GET

03:46.700 --> 03:47.767
HERE?

03:47.834 --> 03:50.934
BUT, OF COURSE, THE LAST FEW

03:51.000 --> 03:52.266
DAYS HAVE SADLY BEEN DOMINATED

03:52.333 --> 03:53.300
BY THIS STORY.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.100
>> GROWING NATIONAL OUTRAGE

03:54.166 --> 03:55.033
ABOUT CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM

03:55.100 --> 03:55.967
THEIR PARENTS WHO CROSSED INTO

03:56.033 --> 03:57.967
THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.

03:58.033 --> 03:59.266
NEARLY 2,000 CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

03:59.333 --> 04:01.367
SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS

04:01.433 --> 04:02.667
UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S ZERO

04:02.734 --> 04:04.066
TOLERANCE POLICY IN THE LAST SIX

04:04.133 --> 04:07.133
WEEKS.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.700
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT, THOUSANDS

04:08.767 --> 04:10.333
OF CHILDREN HAVE BEEN FORCIBLY

04:10.400 --> 04:12.166
TAKEN FROM THEIR PARENTS AFTER A

04:12.233 --> 04:14.400
POLICY SHIFT WAS PUT INTO ACTION

04:14.467 --> 04:15.467
LAST MONTH BY U.S. ATTORNEY

04:15.533 --> 04:19.133
GENERAL AND "LEAST FUN THING TO

04:19.200 --> 04:20.100
FIND IN A KINDER EGG"

04:20.166 --> 04:21.367
JEFF SESSIONS.

04:21.433 --> 04:22.433
SESSIONS BASICALLY DECIDED TO

04:22.500 --> 04:23.367
START INCARCERATING PEOPLE WHO

04:23.433 --> 04:25.333
CROSSED THE BORDER ILLEGALLY,

04:25.400 --> 04:26.834
KNOWING FULL WELL THAT

04:26.900 --> 04:27.767
INCARCERATION WOULD MEAN THEY

04:27.834 --> 04:29.166
WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR

04:29.233 --> 04:30.300
CHILDREN, MANY OF WHOM ARE LESS

04:30.367 --> 04:31.266
THAN TEN YEARS OLD, WITH NO

04:31.333 --> 04:34.567
CLEAR PLAN AS TO WHEN THEY MIGHT

04:34.633 --> 04:41.934
BE REUNITED,

04:42.000 --> 04:42.734
AND THAT IS OBJECTIVELY AWFUL.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.533
AND YET, TRUMP INEXPLICABLY

04:43.600 --> 04:44.300
ARGUED THAT SESSIONS HAD NO

04:44.367 --> 04:44.934
CHOICE.

04:45.000 --> 04:45.734
>> HE'S FOLLOWING LAWS VERY

04:45.800 --> 04:46.667
SIMPLY THAT WERE GIVEN TO US AND

04:46.734 --> 04:48.233
FORCED UPON US BY THE DEMOCRATS.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.066
>> BUT THERE'S STILL --

04:50.133 --> 04:50.633
>> THE DEMOCRATS GAVE US THE

04:50.700 --> 04:52.800
LAWS.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.000
NOW, I WANT THE LAWS TO BE

04:54.066 --> 04:57.200
BEAUTIFUL, HUMANE, BUT STRONG.

04:57.266 --> 04:58.633
>> John: OKAY, SO FIRST,

04:58.700 --> 05:01.100
"BEAUTIFUL, HUMANE, BUT STRONG"?

05:01.166 --> 05:02.166
THAT IS NOT HOW YOU DESCRIBE A

05:02.233 --> 05:03.700
LAW.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.700
THAT'S HOW YOU DESCRIBE A

05:05.767 --> 05:06.734
VIOLA DAVIS CHARACTER IN A MOVIE

05:06.800 --> 05:07.467
CALLED "IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN

05:07.533 --> 05:08.333
WRITTEN YET BUT SHE'LL STILL WIN

05:08.400 --> 05:09.667
THE OSCAR."

05:09.734 --> 05:11.033
ALSO, DEMOCRATS DID NOT GIVE

05:11.100 --> 05:12.400
THEM THESE LAWS, BECAUSE -- AND

05:12.467 --> 05:14.667
I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH --

05:14.734 --> 05:15.533
THERE IS NO LAW THAT SUDDENLY

05:15.600 --> 05:16.667
REQUIRED SEPARATING PARENTS FROM

05:16.734 --> 05:18.033
THEIR CHILDREN.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.533
THIS WAS THE RESULT OF A

05:20.600 --> 05:21.734
DELIBERATE POLICY CHOICE BY

05:21.800 --> 05:23.000
JEFF SESSIONS, A MAN SO SMALL,

05:23.066 --> 05:25.433
HE CAN WEAR, AND THIS IS TRUE, A

05:25.500 --> 05:30.734
RASPBERRY AS A HAT.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.100
THAT'S A FACT.

05:32.166 --> 05:32.934
AND IT'S WEIRD THAT TRUMP TRIED

05:33.000 --> 05:34.900
TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM THIS

05:34.967 --> 05:37.934
DECISION, BECAUSE SESSIONS

05:38.000 --> 05:39.300
DOUBLED DOWN ON THURSDAY, SAYING

05:39.367 --> 05:40.900
THIS COMMAND CAME RIGHT FROM THE

05:40.967 --> 05:41.734
VERY TOP.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.700
>> I WOULD CITE YOU TO THE

05:42.767 --> 05:44.367
APOSTLE PAUL AND HIS CLEAR AND

05:44.433 --> 05:47.100
WISE COMMAND IN ROMANS 13 TO

05:47.166 --> 05:49.300
OBEY THE LAWS OF THE GOVERNMENT

05:49.367 --> 05:50.133
BECAUSE GOD HAS OBDAINED --

05:50.200 --> 05:51.233
ORDAINED THE GOVERNMENT FOR HIS

05:51.300 --> 05:53.934
PURPOSES.

05:54.000 --> 05:54.734
>> John: SO AGAIN, IT'S NOT A

05:54.800 --> 05:55.233
LAW.

05:55.300 --> 05:56.467
AND ALSO, THE BIBLE ISN'T A

05:56.533 --> 05:57.500
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT.

05:57.567 --> 05:59.100
FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE, HE

05:59.166 --> 06:00.567
MIGHT AS WELL BE CITING

06:00.633 --> 06:02.533
"GREEN EGGS AND HAM," SAYING,

06:02.600 --> 06:03.767
"WE MUST KEEP CHILDREN IN A BOX,

06:03.834 --> 06:04.734
WE MUST KEEP THEM WITH A FOX."

06:04.800 --> 06:05.567
WHICH WOULD BE A TERRIBLE

06:05.633 --> 06:06.433
POLICY, ESPECIALLY DEPENDING ON

06:06.500 --> 06:07.600
THE HEIGHT OF THE FOX.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.133
CHILDREN SHOULD BE KEPT AWAY

06:09.200 --> 06:12.066
FROM FOXES OVER A CERTAIN

06:12.133 --> 06:13.400
HEIGHT, BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY

06:13.467 --> 06:18.433
WEIRD AND SCARY.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.567
#NoTallFoxes.

06:20.633 --> 06:21.767
AND ROMANS 13 IS POSSIBLY THE

06:21.834 --> 06:23.033
WORST BIBLE PASSAGE TO BRING UP,

06:23.100 --> 06:24.166
SINCE IT WAS REGULARLY INVOKED

06:24.233 --> 06:25.266
IN CIVIL WAR TIMES BY DEFENDERS

06:25.333 --> 06:28.934
OF SLAVERY.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.133
AND I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY

06:36.200 --> 06:37.000
THINKING, "WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, HE

06:37.066 --> 06:37.500
WOULDN'T ALIGN HIMSELF

06:37.567 --> 06:38.266
WITH SLAVE OWNERS, EVEN

06:38.333 --> 06:38.934
ACCIDENTALLY.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.400
NOT JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD

06:41.467 --> 06:42.066
SESSIONS OF ALABAMA."

06:42.133 --> 06:42.800
I'M SORRY, BUT HE DID.

06:42.867 --> 06:43.633
AND WHEN SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS

06:43.700 --> 06:44.433
WAS ASKED ABOUT SESSIONS'S BIBLE

06:44.500 --> 06:45.600
DEFENSE, SHE BACKED HIM UP.

06:45.667 --> 06:46.700
>> I CAN SAY THAT IT IS VERY

06:46.767 --> 06:48.433
BIBLICAL TO ENFORCE THE LAW.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.734
THAT IS ACTUALLY REPEATED A

06:49.800 --> 06:50.900
NUMBER OF TIMES THROUGHOUT THE

06:50.967 --> 06:55.033
BIBLE.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.100
>> John: SO, A, NOT A FUCKING

06:57.166 --> 06:57.266
LAW!

06:57.333 --> 06:58.233
AND, B, LOTS OF THINGS ARE SAID

06:58.300 --> 06:58.834
IN THE BIBLE, BUT THAT DOESN'T

06:58.900 --> 06:59.900
MEAN YOU SHOULD DO THEM.

06:59.967 --> 07:11.500
AT ONE POINT, THE BIBLE DEMANDS

07:11.567 --> 07:12.433
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

07:12.500 --> 07:13.066
THAT THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT GET

07:13.133 --> 07:13.700
100 FORESKINS, BUT I DON'T THINK

07:13.767 --> 07:14.300
THAT SANDERS IS LOOKING FOR

07:14.367 --> 07:14.934
CONGRESS TO GATHER TOGETHER AND

07:15.000 --> 07:15.367
START SLICING DICKS.

07:15.433 --> 07:15.934
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

07:16.000 --> 07:16.533
MIGHT WANT TO GO A LITTLE EASY

07:16.600 --> 07:17.100
ON HOLDING THE BIBLE UP AS A

07:17.166 --> 07:17.900
MORAL CODE.

07:17.967 --> 07:19.133
'CAUSE LET'S REMEMBER, THE

07:19.200 --> 07:20.133
BIBLE'S NOT A FAN OF ADULTERY,

07:20.200 --> 07:21.500
GLUTTONY, COVETING YOUR

07:21.567 --> 07:21.667
WHAT

07:21.734 --> 07:22.667
NEIGHBOR'S WIFE, PRIDE, OR

07:22.734 --> 07:27.967
WRATH.

07:28.033 --> 07:30.834
WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS, YOU

07:30.900 --> 07:34.400
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE JUST USING

07:34.467 --> 07:36.900
THE BIBLE TO JUSTIFY SEPARATING

07:36.967 --> 07:37.900
CHILDREN FROM PARENTS, BUT IF

07:37.967 --> 07:38.467
YOU DO,

07:38.533 --> 07:40.233
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE

07:40.300 --> 07:41.667
BREAKING SO MANY OF ITS RULES

07:41.734 --> 07:42.266
THAT GOD HAS TO WRITE AN EXTRA

07:42.333 --> 07:42.734
COMMANDMENT THAT SAYS

07:42.800 --> 07:43.367
"I WAS FUCKING SERIOUS."

07:43.433 --> 07:46.800
AND NOW THIS.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.567
>> Announcer: I KNOW,

07:49.633 --> 07:50.767
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER CAUSING AN

07:50.834 --> 07:51.166
ENDLESS TIMELY.

07:51.233 --> 07:53.967
>> I HAD JUST LEARNED THAT I HAD

07:54.033 --> 07:55.667
WON A SCHOLARSHIP TO TRAVEL ALL

07:55.734 --> 07:57.000
AROUND THE WORLD.

07:57.066 --> 07:58.800
AT THE SAME TIME, I HAD MET A

07:58.867 --> 08:00.767
GIRL AND FELL IN LOVE.

08:00.834 --> 08:01.800
OH.

08:01.867 --> 08:03.433
OH.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.433
OH.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.467
OH.

08:06.533 --> 08:07.767
OH.

08:07.834 --> 08:08.533
AND I WAS TORN.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.767
DO I GO AROUND THE WORLD ON THE

08:10.834 --> 08:12.533
ALL EXPENSE PAID SCHOLARSHIP FOR

08:12.600 --> 08:13.567
A WHOLE YEAR?

08:13.633 --> 08:16.000
OR DO I STAY HOME WITH THE GIRL,

08:16.066 --> 08:17.567
MY FIRST TRUE LOVE?

08:17.633 --> 08:19.233
CLASS OF 2018, WHAT WOULD YOU

08:19.300 --> 08:21.367
HAVE DONE?

08:21.433 --> 08:24.767
CLASS OF 2017?

08:24.834 --> 08:26.667
2016?

08:26.734 --> 08:29.967
2015?

08:30.033 --> 08:31.367
14, 13, 12?

08:31.433 --> 08:32.567
SHE DUMPED ME.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.233
THERE I WAS, NO SCHOLARSHIP, AND

08:34.300 --> 08:36.934
A TRIP AROUND THE WORLD, NO

08:37.000 --> 08:40.767
GIRL, GIRL, GIRL, GIRL, GIRL, NO

08:40.834 --> 08:41.266
GIRL.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.400
BUT SOMEHOW I PICKED MYSELF UP,

08:43.467 --> 08:44.400
DUSTED MYSELF OFF, AND A FEW

08:44.467 --> 08:46.767
YEARS LATER, I FOUND MYSELF

08:46.834 --> 08:49.000
SEATED AT GRADUATION ONCE AGAIN,

08:49.066 --> 08:49.767
FOUND MYSELF SEATED AT

08:49.834 --> 08:51.800
GRADUATION ONCE AGAIN, ONCE

08:51.867 --> 08:53.333
AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.000
I WAS SEATED AT COLLEGE

08:54.066 --> 08:54.633
GRADUATION.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.033
I HAD JUST LEARNED THAT I HAD

08:57.100 --> 08:59.100
WON A SCHOLARSHIP TO TRAVEL ALL

08:59.166 --> 09:00.533
AROUND THE WORLD...

09:00.600 --> 09:07.033
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

09:07.734 --> 09:08.667
>> John: MOVING ON.

09:08.734 --> 09:09.734
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

09:09.800 --> 09:10.667
CHINA, THE COUNTRY RESPONSIBLE

09:10.734 --> 09:11.500
FOR HUGE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES,

09:11.567 --> 09:12.767
AND YET, IT STILL CAN'T SEEM TO

09:12.834 --> 09:14.233
GET PANDAS TO FUCK.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.533
CHINA IS A GIGANTIC AND

09:15.600 --> 09:17.333
CONSEQUENTIAL COUNTRY WHERE

09:17.400 --> 09:18.633
ROUGHLY ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE

09:18.700 --> 09:21.667
PEOPLE ON EARTH LIVE.

09:21.734 --> 09:22.567
IT IS ALSO THE PLACE TRUMP HAS

09:22.633 --> 09:24.300
BEEN RANTING ABOUT FOR YEARS.

09:24.367 --> 09:25.367
>> CHINA IS KILLING US.

09:25.433 --> 09:25.934
WHAT CHINA'S DOING TO US IS

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
HORRIBLE.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.166
CHINA CHEATS.

09:28.233 --> 09:30.166
THEY DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY.

09:30.233 --> 09:32.333
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO ALLOW CHINA

09:32.400 --> 09:33.467
TO RAPE OUR COUNTRY, AND THAT'S

09:33.533 --> 09:36.967
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

09:37.033 --> 09:38.033
>> John: OKAY, SO EVEN IN THE

09:38.100 --> 09:39.000
CONTEXT OF A METAPHOR, THE WORD

09:39.066 --> 09:40.200
"RAPE" IS PRETTY JARRING.

09:40.266 --> 09:41.667
AS VERBS GO, IT'S NOT EXACTLY

09:41.734 --> 09:44.100
BANDIED ABOUT.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.166
IF TRUMP SAID, "CONGRESS

09:45.233 --> 09:46.300
IS REALLY TOE-FUCKING ME ON THIS

09:46.367 --> 09:47.467
BORDER WALL," THE UNDERLYING

09:47.533 --> 09:49.000
POINT IS CLEAR.

09:49.066 --> 09:49.900
WHY HE CHOSE TO EXPRESS IT THAT

09:49.967 --> 09:53.567
WAY IS NOT.

09:53.633 --> 09:54.133
AND YET, FOR ALL TRUMP TALKS

09:54.200 --> 09:54.734
ABOUT IT, IT SEEMS HE'S VERY

09:54.800 --> 09:55.700
MUCH IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING

09:55.767 --> 09:56.800
ABOUT IT.

09:56.867 --> 09:57.867
JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

09:57.934 --> 09:59.066
MICROPHONES PICKED UP THIS

09:59.133 --> 10:00.066
EXCHANGE WITH CHINA'S PRESIDENT

10:00.133 --> 10:01.333
DURING A STATE VISIT BACK IN

10:01.400 --> 10:03.033
NOVEMBER.

10:03.100 --> 10:03.767
>> CHINA, 5,000 YEARS IT GOES

10:03.834 --> 10:04.767
BACK, RIGHT?

10:04.834 --> 10:12.266
>> I GUESS THE OLDEST CULTURE

10:12.333 --> 10:13.700
THEY SAY IS EGYPT AT 8,000.

10:14.934 --> 10:23.200
>> John: NOW, IF YOU'RE WORRIED

10:23.266 --> 10:24.166
TRUMP ACTUALLY LEARNED SOMETHING

10:24.233 --> 10:25.967
THERE, REST ASSURED, THE ONLY

10:26.033 --> 10:27.200
THING HE TOOK AWAY FROM THAT WAS

10:27.266 --> 10:28.166
THAT EGYPT IS OLDER AND

10:28.233 --> 10:29.467
THEREFORE LESS FUCKABLE THAN

10:29.533 --> 10:30.767
CHINA.

10:30.834 --> 10:31.834
"OKAY, GREAT.

10:31.900 --> 10:32.867
NOTE TO SELF, DON'T FUCK EGYPT.

10:32.934 --> 10:34.567
TOO OLD."

10:34.633 --> 10:37.266
BUT THE TRUTH IS, A LOT OF US

10:37.333 --> 10:38.467
ARE PROBABLY UNDERINFORMED ABOUT

10:38.533 --> 10:39.767
CHINA, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

10:39.834 --> 10:40.867
ITS LEADERS HAVE HISTORICALLY

10:40.934 --> 10:43.333
BEEN FINE WITH.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.633
DENG XIAOPING FAMOUSLY HAD A

10:44.700 --> 10:45.900
"LAY LOW" INTERNATIONAL

10:45.967 --> 10:47.200
STRATEGY, SUMMED UP BY THE

10:47.266 --> 10:48.633
SAYING, "HIDE YOUR STRENGTH AND

10:48.700 --> 10:49.967
BIDE YOUR TIME."

10:50.033 --> 10:51.767
BUT IN RECENT YEARS, THERE'S

10:51.834 --> 10:54.100
BEEN A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT,

10:54.166 --> 10:55.734
BECAUSE WHEN CHINA'S CURRENT

10:55.800 --> 10:57.133
LEADER, XI JINPING, ASSUMED THE

10:57.200 --> 10:57.934
HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND, HE

10:58.000 --> 11:00.200
SAID THIS:

11:00.266 --> 11:01.734
>> CHINA NEEDS TO LEARN MORE

11:01.800 --> 11:03.033
ABOUT THE WORLD.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.734
THE WORLD ALSO NEEDS TO LEARN

11:04.800 --> 11:12.633
MORE ABOUT CHINA.

11:12.700 --> 11:13.200
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:13.266 --> 11:13.834
HE'S RIGHT.

11:13.900 --> 11:14.633
WE PROBABLY SHOULD'VE TALKED

11:14.700 --> 11:15.600
MORE ABOUT CHINA ON THIS SHOW,

11:15.667 --> 11:16.667
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING WE'VE

11:16.734 --> 11:18.266
DONE ROUGHLY 4,000 DIFFERENT

11:18.333 --> 11:19.300
STORIES ON NEW ZEALAND AND

11:19.367 --> 11:20.100
MULTIPLE PIECES ON A

11:20.166 --> 11:21.066
TESTICLE RECEPTACLE FROM THE

11:21.133 --> 11:22.033
2005 RUSSELL CROWE FILM

11:22.100 --> 11:23.600
"CINDERELLA MAN."

11:23.667 --> 11:24.967
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

11:25.033 --> 11:25.734
CHINA, AND LET'S PUT AMERICA

11:25.800 --> 11:27.133
ASIDE FOR MOST OF THIS PIECE AND

11:27.200 --> 11:28.233
TALK ABOUT CHINA ON ITS OWN

11:28.300 --> 11:31.166
TERMS, BECAUSE IT'S BEEN GOING

11:31.233 --> 11:33.100
THROUGH SEISMIC SOCIAL,

11:33.166 --> 11:34.433
ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL CHANGES,

11:34.500 --> 11:38.400
WHICH HAVE HAPPENED

11:38.467 --> 11:39.433
HEAD-SPINNINGLY QUICKLY, AND

11:39.500 --> 11:40.233
MANY OF THEM CENTER ON ITS

11:40.300 --> 11:41.734
LEADER, XI JINPING, WHO JUST

11:41.800 --> 11:43.867
RECENTLY TIGHTENED HIS GRIP ON

11:43.934 --> 11:45.433
POWER.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.900
>> THE MOST DRAMATIC POLITICAL

11:46.967 --> 11:48.533
CHANGE IN CHINA IN DECADES, A

11:48.600 --> 11:49.433
VOTE TO SCRAP TERM LIMITS FOR

11:49.500 --> 11:52.200
CHINA'S PRESIDENT.

11:52.266 --> 11:53.300
THE MOVE CLEARS THE WAY FOR

11:53.367 --> 11:54.867
XI JINPING TO STAY IN POWER

11:54.934 --> 11:56.467
INDEFINITELY AND POSSIBLY FOR

11:56.533 --> 11:59.600
LIFE.

11:59.667 --> 12:00.934
OF NEARLY 3,000 BALLOTS, ONLY

12:01.000 --> 12:02.166
TWO VOTED AGAINST THE

12:02.233 --> 12:04.834
UNPRECEDENTED MOVE.

12:04.900 --> 12:06.800
>> John: 3,000 TO 2!

12:06.867 --> 12:08.033
WHICH MEANS AFTER THE VOTE,

12:08.100 --> 12:09.467
THERE WERE TWO MEMBERS OF

12:09.533 --> 12:15.300
CHINESE PARLIAMENT THINKING

12:15.367 --> 12:16.567
"WHOOPSIE!

12:16.633 --> 12:17.567
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT WOULD GO

12:17.633 --> 12:18.934
THE OTHER WAY.

12:19.000 --> 12:19.567
MAYBE AN EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT WILL

12:19.633 --> 12:20.433
SMOOTH THINGS OVER WITH THE MAN

12:20.500 --> 12:21.400
WHO'S NOW EMPEROR FOR LIFE."

12:21.467 --> 12:22.633
AND THAT FOLLOWED ON THE HEELS

12:22.700 --> 12:23.767
OF WHAT WAS ARGUABLY AN EVEN

12:23.834 --> 12:25.367
BIGGER CHANGE, THE FACT THAT,

12:25.433 --> 12:26.433
LAST OCTOBER, XI'S POLITICAL

12:26.500 --> 12:27.700
DOCTRINE, KNOWN AS "XI JINPING

12:27.767 --> 12:29.000
THOUGHT," WAS ENSHRINED IN THE

12:29.066 --> 12:30.100
PARTY'S CONSTITUTION.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.567
THAT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH TO

12:31.633 --> 12:32.867
YOU, BUT IT'S ROUGHLY THE

12:32.934 --> 12:34.767
EQUIVALENT OF DONALD TRUMP

12:34.834 --> 12:36.367
MAKING HIMSELF A FOUNDING FATHER

12:36.433 --> 12:37.700
AND INCLUDING "DONALD TRUMP

12:37.767 --> 12:38.834
THOUGHT" INTO THE CONSTITUTION,

12:38.900 --> 12:40.266
WHICH WOULD MEAN HISTORIANS IN

12:40.333 --> 12:41.900
THE FUTURE WOULD HAVE TO PARSE

12:41.967 --> 12:43.000
THE MEANING OF, "WHILE

12:43.066 --> 12:44.533
BETTE MIDLER IS AN EXTREMELY

12:44.600 --> 12:45.433
UNATTRACTIVE WOMAN, I REFUSE TO

12:45.500 --> 12:46.934
SAY THAT BECAUSE I ALWAYS INSIST

12:47.000 --> 12:50.400
ON BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT."

12:50.467 --> 12:51.800
AND XI'S CONSOLIDATION OF POWER

12:51.867 --> 12:53.333
HAS BEEN AIDED BY THE FACT THAT,

12:53.400 --> 12:55.233
UNLIKE MANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS,

12:55.300 --> 12:56.600
WHO'VE TENDED TO BE DULL

12:56.667 --> 12:57.800
BUREAUCRATS, HE'S GONE OUT OF

12:57.867 --> 12:59.533
HIS WAY TO FORM A CULT OF

12:59.600 --> 13:01.300
PERSONALITY ABOUT HIMSELF.

13:01.367 --> 13:03.433
FOR A TIME, STATE MEDIA CALLED

13:03.500 --> 13:05.567
HIM "XI DADA," OR "UNCLE XI,"

13:05.633 --> 13:07.200
BOTH OF WHICH ARE OBJECTIVELY

13:07.266 --> 13:09.166
WEIRD NAMES FOR AN ADULT TO CALL

13:09.233 --> 13:10.467
ANOTHER ADULT, BUT FANTASTIC

13:10.533 --> 13:11.700
NAMES FOR A PAIR OF HAIRLESS

13:11.767 --> 13:13.000
CATS.

13:13.066 --> 13:14.066
"XI DADA!

13:14.133 --> 13:15.433
UNCLE XI!

13:15.500 --> 13:17.033
DINNER'S READY, YOU CREEPY

13:17.100 --> 13:21.633
WEIRDOS!"

13:21.700 --> 13:22.600
AND XI CAREFULLY PRESENTS A

13:22.667 --> 13:23.633
"MAN OF THE PEOPLE" IMAGE.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.734
HIS ORIGIN STORY IS FAMOUS IN

13:25.800 --> 13:26.934
CHINA: BORN INTO AN ELITE

13:27.000 --> 13:28.066
FAMILY, HIS FATHER FELL FROM

13:28.133 --> 13:29.100
GRACE, AND LIKE MANY, DURING

13:29.166 --> 13:32.367
MAO'S CULTURAL REVOLUTION, HE

13:32.433 --> 13:33.266
WAS SENT TO WORK IN A RURAL

13:33.333 --> 13:34.233
VILLAGE, A PLACE WHICH HAS NOW

13:34.300 --> 13:35.700
BECOME A TOURIST TRAP.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.367
>> THE SMARTLY-DRESSED TOUR

13:37.433 --> 13:38.800
GUIDE SHOWS US WHERE XI SLEPT.

13:38.867 --> 13:40.567
AN OLD PICTURE ON THE WALL.

13:40.633 --> 13:42.800
WE SEE A WELL HE HELPED DIG AND

13:42.867 --> 13:45.734
A SEWING SHOP HE SET UP.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.333
OLD FARMERS WHO KNEW XI BACK

13:48.400 --> 13:49.800
THEN STILL ROAM ABOUT, THE

13:49.867 --> 13:51.133
PSEUDO-MASCOTS OF THIS BIZARRE

13:51.200 --> 13:53.433
THEME PARK.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.400
>> John: THAT IS A BIZARRE THEME

13:54.467 --> 13:55.900
PARK, AND I SAY THAT KNOWING

13:55.967 --> 13:58.567
FULL WELL THAT THIS COUNTRY'S

13:58.633 --> 13:59.867
MOST BELOVED THEME PARK FEATURES

13:59.934 --> 14:01.600
VOMIT-INDUCING TEA CUPS AND A

14:01.667 --> 14:02.600
MASSIVE PANTS-LESS SAILOR DUCK

14:02.667 --> 14:03.934
WITH NO GENITALS.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.533
AND XI'S BRANDING ISN'T CONFINED

14:09.600 --> 14:10.200
TO TOURIST ATTRACTIONS.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.100
STATE MEDIA HAS ALSO FEATURED

14:11.166 --> 14:12.066
FOLKSY MOMENTS LIKE THIS VIDEO

14:12.133 --> 14:13.834
OF HIM ORDERING PORK BUNS AT A

14:13.900 --> 14:15.867
BEIJING RESTAURANT.

14:15.934 --> 14:20.033
NOW, THAT VISIT WAS HUGE NEWS IN

14:20.100 --> 14:21.133
CHINA, AND THAT CAN BE HARD TO

14:21.200 --> 14:21.900
BELIEVE, BECAUSE OUR POLITICIANS

14:21.967 --> 14:22.533
EAT JUNK FOOD IN FRONT OF US ALL

14:22.600 --> 14:23.934
THE TIME.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.867
YOU CAN FIND PHOTOS OF 12 OF THE

14:24.934 --> 14:26.233
LAST 12 PRESIDENTS SHOVING

14:26.300 --> 14:29.200
ICE CREAM IN THEIR FACES.

14:29.266 --> 14:30.934
IT'S ACTUALLY LEGITIMATELY

14:31.000 --> 14:32.900
CHALLENGING TO FIND A SINGLE

14:32.967 --> 14:35.367
PHOTO OF OBAMA WHERE HE'S NOT

14:35.433 --> 14:39.266
ABOUT TO INHALE HALF A PINT OF

14:39.333 --> 14:40.967
VANILLA.

14:41.033 --> 14:42.400
I DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT HE'D

14:42.467 --> 14:43.300
BEEN DEMOLISHING A WAFFLE CONE

14:43.367 --> 14:44.100
DURING THE BIN LADEN RAID, BUT

14:44.166 --> 14:45.066
CLEARLY, I'D REMEMBERED IT

14:45.133 --> 14:47.700
WRONG.

14:47.767 --> 14:48.467
I WAS WRONG.

14:48.533 --> 14:49.300
BUT THE REASONS FOR XI'S

14:49.367 --> 14:50.233
POPULARITY GO BEYOND MARKETING

14:50.300 --> 14:51.400
HIMSELF AS A CUDDLY XI DADA YOU

14:51.467 --> 14:54.533
CAN GRAB A PORK BUN WITH.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.800
'CAUSE FOR STARTERS, HE'S RIDING

14:55.867 --> 14:57.000
AN ECONOMIC WAVE THAT LONG

14:57.066 --> 14:57.834
PRECEDES HIM.

14:57.900 --> 14:58.567
OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS, CHINA'S

14:58.633 --> 14:59.767
GDP GROWTH HAS AVERAGED NEARLY

14:59.834 --> 15:02.667
10% A YEAR, MAKING IT THE

15:02.734 --> 15:04.834
FASTEST SUSTAINED EXPANSION BY A

15:04.900 --> 15:06.500
MAJOR ECONOMY IN HISTORY, WHICH

15:06.567 --> 15:08.300
HAS ENABLED MORE THAN 800

15:08.367 --> 15:10.100
MILLION PEOPLE TO LIFT

15:10.166 --> 15:12.066
THEMSELVES OUT OF POVERTY, AND

15:12.133 --> 15:13.433
MANY IN CHINA'S GROWING MIDDLE

15:13.500 --> 15:14.567
CLASS ARE PRETTY CONTENT WITH

15:14.633 --> 15:17.133
HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.400
>> THE TREMENDOUS PUBLIC

15:18.467 --> 15:19.900
OPTIMISM IS STRIKING.

15:19.967 --> 15:21.033
EVERYONE IS DOING BETTER THAN

15:21.100 --> 15:23.033
THEIR PARENTS DID IN THEIR DAY.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.000
>> I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE

15:24.066 --> 15:25.767
TO A BIGGER HOUSE WITHIN THE

15:25.834 --> 15:27.667
NEXT FIVE YEARS, AND I EXPECT MY

15:27.734 --> 15:30.800
LIFE TO IMPROVE A LOT.

15:30.867 --> 15:31.900
WHATEVER HAPPENS, I'M VERY

15:31.967 --> 15:33.233
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.800
>> John: WOW.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.233
A SENSE OF OPTIMISM ABOUT THE

15:36.300 --> 15:40.633
FUTURE.

15:40.700 --> 15:41.233
I'VE GOT TO SAY, AS A BRITISH

15:41.300 --> 15:42.433
PERSON, I FIND THAT

15:42.500 --> 15:42.967
UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE.

15:43.033 --> 15:43.867
IF YOU LOOK UP "OPTIMISM" IN THE

15:43.934 --> 15:45.934
OED -- AND THIS IS TRUE -- THE

15:46.000 --> 15:50.533
DEFINITION SIMPLY READS "NO."

15:50.600 --> 15:52.567
SO FOR MANY IN CHINA, THINGS ARE

15:52.633 --> 15:54.500
GOING UNDENIABLY WELL, BUT XI

15:54.567 --> 15:56.567
HAS EVEN GREATER AMBITIONS, AND

15:56.633 --> 15:58.400
I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON TWO

15:58.467 --> 15:59.367
MASSIVE, SIGNATURE PROJECTS, ONE

15:59.433 --> 16:01.900
GLOBAL AND ONE DOMESTIC.

16:01.967 --> 16:03.633
FIRST, THERE'S HIS SO-CALLED

16:03.700 --> 16:05.767
BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE, A PLAN

16:05.834 --> 16:06.934
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY GIGANTIC IN

16:07.000 --> 16:08.900
SCOPE.

16:08.967 --> 16:12.767
BASICALLY, IT INVOLVES CHINA

16:12.834 --> 16:13.600
SPENDING $1 TRILLION ON

16:13.667 --> 16:14.900
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN MORE

16:14.967 --> 16:15.967
THAN 60 COUNTRIES -- THINGS LIKE

16:16.033 --> 16:17.066
PORTS, BRIDGES, AND ROADS --

16:17.133 --> 16:18.200
WITH THE IDEA THAT IT COULD

16:18.266 --> 16:19.233
EVENTUALLY SPAN INTERNATIONAL

16:19.300 --> 16:20.700
LAND AND SEA ROUTES AND RESHAPE

16:20.767 --> 16:21.867
GLOBAL TRADE WITH CHINA AT ITS

16:21.934 --> 16:23.400
CENTER.

16:23.467 --> 16:24.834
TO HEAR CHINA TELL IT, IT'S THE

16:24.900 --> 16:26.100
MOST AMBITIOUS INFRASTRUCTURE

16:26.166 --> 16:27.433
PROJECT IN MODERN HISTORY.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.834
THEY'VE EVEN PRODUCED AN

16:28.900 --> 16:29.834
ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PROPAGANDA

16:29.900 --> 16:31.133

17:33.667 --> 17:34.834
I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE EITHER.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.233
THEY'VE BASICALLY MADE

17:36.300 --> 17:37.533
KOMMUNIST KARS FOR KIDS.

17:37.600 --> 17:41.600
THAT IS UNFORGIVABLE.

17:41.667 --> 17:44.333
NOW, IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY

17:44.400 --> 17:46.500
WHETHER THE BELT AND ROAD IS

17:46.567 --> 17:47.600
GOING TO BE A SUCCESS, BUT XI'S

17:47.667 --> 17:48.900
SECOND BOLD PROJECT HAS ALREADY

17:48.967 --> 17:50.433
SEEN RESULTS, BECAUSE HE'S

17:50.500 --> 17:51.800
UNDERTAKEN A MASSIVE CRACKDOWN

17:51.867 --> 17:53.400
ON POLITICAL CORRUPTION --

17:53.467 --> 17:54.467
A LONGSTANDING GRIEVANCE AMONG

17:54.533 --> 17:55.433
CHINESE CITIZENS.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.867
IT'S LED TO THE INVESTIGATION

17:56.934 --> 17:58.233
AND PUNISHMENT OF HUNDREDS OF

17:58.300 --> 17:59.567
THOUSANDS OF GOVERNMENT

17:59.633 --> 18:01.033
OFFICIALS, SOME AT THE VERY TOP

18:01.100 --> 18:02.300
OF THE PARTY.

18:02.367 --> 18:03.433
AND THIS HAS BEEN WIDELY

18:03.500 --> 18:04.800
CELEBRATED, WITH STATE MEDIA

18:04.867 --> 18:05.900
EVEN PRODUCING A

18:05.967 --> 18:08.133
CRACKDOWN-THEMED COMPUTER GAME.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.667
>> "THE PEOPLE'S DAILY," A

18:09.734 --> 18:11.033
COMMUNIST PARTY MOUTHPIECE,

18:11.100 --> 18:13.233
RELEASED A COMPUTER GAME WHERE

18:13.300 --> 18:14.633
USERS CAN GIVE ELECTRIC SHOCKS

18:14.700 --> 18:19.533
TO CORRUPT OFFICIALS.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.066
>> John: WELL, THAT'S FUN!

18:21.133 --> 18:23.767
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE SINISTER

18:23.834 --> 18:24.934
ABOUT BEING INVITED TO

18:25.000 --> 18:26.233
ELECTROCUTE PRISONERS IN A

18:26.300 --> 18:28.100
GOVERNMENT

18:28.166 --> 18:29.066
THAT'S THE MOST ENTERTAINING WAY

18:29.133 --> 18:30.667
TO PACKAGE SOMETHING TROUBLING

18:30.734 --> 18:32.867
SINCE FDR'S SMASH-HIT BOARD

18:32.934 --> 18:34.000
GAME, "CANDY LAND JUST KIDDING

18:34.066 --> 18:35.133
IT'S A JAPANESE-AMERICAN

18:35.200 --> 18:37.100
INTERNMENT CAMP."

18:37.166 --> 18:42.867
AND THIS IS WHERE WE REACH THE

18:42.934 --> 18:44.166
POINT OF THE STORY THAT YOU KIND

18:44.233 --> 18:45.100
OF KNEW WAS COMING.

18:45.166 --> 18:45.834
BECAUSE SO FAR, EVERYTHING I'VE

18:45.900 --> 18:46.467
SHOWN YOU IS WHAT XI DADA WANTS

18:46.533 --> 18:47.066
YOU TO KNOW ABOUT CHINA.

18:47.133 --> 18:47.934
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF TROUBLING

18:48.000 --> 18:49.066
STUFF UNDER THE SURFACE.

18:49.133 --> 18:49.900
FOR INSTANCE, CONVENIENTLY FOR

18:49.967 --> 18:52.900
XI, SOME OF THOSE SWEPT UP IN

18:52.967 --> 18:54.200
THE CORRUPTION PURGE WERE HIS

18:54.266 --> 18:55.900
POLITICAL RIVALS, AND THOSE

18:55.967 --> 18:57.734
ACCUSED WERE OFTEN FUNNELED INTO

18:57.800 --> 18:58.800
A SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED

18:58.867 --> 19:00.000
AS "A SECRETIVE, EXTRALEGAL

19:00.066 --> 19:01.467
PROCESS" WHERE "INTERROGATORS

19:01.533 --> 19:03.066
SEEK TO EXTRACT CONFESSIONS,

19:03.133 --> 19:04.767
SOMETIMES THROUGH TORTURE."

19:04.834 --> 19:06.500
AND IT'S WORTH KNOWING THAT

19:06.567 --> 19:07.767
THOSE TERM LIMITS HE

19:07.834 --> 19:09.133
SUCCESSFULLY ELIMINATED WERE PUT

19:09.200 --> 19:11.367
IN PLACE FOR A PRETTY GOOD

19:11.433 --> 19:12.934
REASON -- SPECIFICALLY, TO AVOID

19:13.000 --> 19:14.700
ANOTHER MAO -- UNDER WHOSE

19:14.767 --> 19:16.333
REGIME SOME HORRIFIC THINGS

19:16.400 --> 19:17.567
HAPPENED IN CHINA, FROM A

19:17.633 --> 19:20.066
COLLECTIVIZED FARMING ATTEMPT

19:20.133 --> 19:22.500
THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR AT

19:22.567 --> 19:23.300
LEAST 45 MILLION DEATHS TO A

19:23.367 --> 19:24.934
CULTURAL REVOLUTION THAT

19:25.000 --> 19:27.700
WAS ESTIMATED TO HAVE KILLED AT

19:27.767 --> 19:28.533
LEAST ANOTHER MILLION TO HIS

19:28.600 --> 19:29.333
BELIEF THAT THIS SWIMSUIT WAS

19:29.400 --> 19:30.100
FLATTERING.

19:30.166 --> 19:30.834
WHICH I REALIZE, NOW THAT I SAY

19:30.900 --> 19:34.200
IT, REALLY DOESN'T BELONG WITH

19:34.266 --> 19:35.433
THE OTHER TWO IN THAT LIST.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.400
THE POINT IS, XI IS ACTIVELY

19:36.467 --> 19:37.533
REMOVING THE POST-MAO GUARDRAILS

19:37.600 --> 19:38.934
THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.367
AND WHILE CHINA HAS NEVER

19:40.433 --> 19:41.900
EXACTLY BEEN KNOWN AS A HAVEN

19:41.967 --> 19:43.166
FOR FREE EXPRESSION, HE HAS

19:43.233 --> 19:44.834
CLAMPED DOWN NOTICEABLY ON ANY

19:44.900 --> 19:48.367
FORM OF DISSENT WHATSOEVER.

19:48.433 --> 19:49.834
>> THERE IS DISSENT ONLINE, AND

19:49.900 --> 19:51.233
CHINA'S CENSORS ARE WORKING HARD

19:51.300 --> 19:52.867
TO QUASH IT.

19:52.934 --> 19:55.533
THEY TEMPORARILY BANNED THE USE

19:55.600 --> 19:58.133
OF PHRASES SUCH AS

19:58.200 --> 19:59.367
"PERSONALITY CULT" AND

19:59.433 --> 20:00.700
"MY EMPEROR," AND ALSO

20:00.767 --> 20:03.300
REFERENCES TO WINNIE THE POOH, A

20:03.367 --> 20:04.767
CHARACTER LONG-USED TO MOCK

20:04.834 --> 20:05.834
XI JINPING BASED ON AN APPARENT

20:05.900 --> 20:09.934
RESEMBLANCE.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.767
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

20:11.834 --> 20:14.133
IT'S TRUE.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.300
APPARENTLY XI JINPING IS VERY

20:16.367 --> 20:18.200
SENSITIVE ABOUT HIS PERCEIVED

20:18.266 --> 20:18.834
RESEMBLANCE TO WINNIE THE POOH.

20:18.900 --> 20:19.600
AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE IT'S THAT

20:19.667 --> 20:20.500
STRONG A RESEMBLANCE, BUT THE

20:20.567 --> 20:21.500
FACT HE'S ANNOYED ABOUT IT MEANS

20:21.567 --> 20:22.767
PEOPLE WILL NEVER STOP BRINGING

20:22.834 --> 20:25.500
IT UP.

20:25.567 --> 20:26.333
TRUST ME, XI, IF YOUR FACE EVEN

20:26.400 --> 20:27.433
REMOTELY RESEMBLES THAT OF A

20:27.500 --> 20:30.166
BELOVED CARTOON CHARACTER, THE

20:30.233 --> 20:35.300
SMART MOVE HERE IS TO LEAN IN.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.000
AND CLAMPING DOWN ON

20:37.066 --> 20:38.734
WINNIE THE POOH COMPARISONS

20:38.800 --> 20:39.266
DOESN'T EXACTLY PROJECT

20:39.333 --> 20:41.166
STRENGTH.

20:41.233 --> 20:43.367
IT SUGGESTS A WEIRD INSECURITY.

20:43.433 --> 20:44.633
AND EXPERTS SAY THAT XI IS

20:44.700 --> 20:46.166
DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT PUBLIC

20:46.233 --> 20:51.100
OPINION WILL TURN ON HIM.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.033
CHINA'S ECONOMY IS ALREADY

20:52.100 --> 20:52.834
SLOWING, AND XI IS REPORTEDLY

20:52.900 --> 20:54.500
HAUNTED BY THE SPECTERS OF THE

20:54.567 --> 20:55.867
ARAB SPRING AND THE

20:55.934 --> 20:57.166
SOVIET UNION'S COLLAPSE, AND

20:57.233 --> 20:57.934
THAT PARANOIA MAY BE WHY HE'S SO

20:58.000 --> 20:59.033
ANXIOUS TO MICROMANAGE CHINESE

20:59.100 --> 21:01.200
DAILY LIFE.

21:01.266 --> 21:02.500
THE GOVERNMENT HAS A LIST OF

21:02.567 --> 21:04.200
UNTRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE, WHICH CAN

21:04.266 --> 21:05.333
RESTRICT CITIZENS' ABILITY TO

21:05.400 --> 21:06.967
TRAVEL, BUY A HOUSE, OR TAKE OUT

21:07.033 --> 21:08.633
LOANS, AND OVER THE NEXT FEW

21:08.700 --> 21:09.967
YEARS, THERE ARE PLANS TO TAKE

21:10.033 --> 21:11.633
THINGS MUCH FURTHER.

21:11.700 --> 21:14.233
>> EVERY CHINESE CITIZEN IS

21:14.300 --> 21:15.734
BEING ASSIGNED A SOCIAL CREDIT

21:15.800 --> 21:17.500
SCORE, A FLUCTUATING RATING

21:17.567 --> 21:19.033
BASED ON A RANGE OF BEHAVIORS.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.800
IT'S BELIEVED THAT COMMUNITY

21:20.867 --> 21:22.233
SERVICE AND BUYING CHINESE-MADE

21:22.300 --> 21:25.000
PRODUCTS CAN RAISE YOUR SCORE.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.333
FRAUD, TAX EVASION, AND SMOKING

21:26.400 --> 21:27.667
IN NON-SMOKING AREAS CAN DROP

21:27.734 --> 21:30.266
IT.

21:30.333 --> 21:32.133
IF A SCORE GETS TOO LOW, A

21:32.200 --> 21:33.900
PERSON CAN BE BANNED FROM BUYING

21:33.967 --> 21:34.700
PLANE AND TRAIN TICKETS,

21:34.767 --> 21:36.133
REAL ESTATE, CARS, AND EVEN

21:36.200 --> 21:38.667
HIGH-SPEED INTERNET.

21:38.734 --> 21:40.433
>> John: YEAH, YOU COULD BE CUT

21:40.500 --> 21:42.266
OFF FROM HIGH-SPEED INTERNET.

21:42.333 --> 21:43.467
ALTHOUGH THAT COULD BE A HUGE

21:43.533 --> 21:44.533
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FINEST

21:44.600 --> 21:45.433
PURVEYORS OF SHITTY LOW-SPEED

21:45.500 --> 21:46.967
INTERNET.

21:47.033 --> 21:49.000
I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT

21:49.066 --> 21:50.567
AT&T, ONE OF AMERICA'S LEAST

21:50.633 --> 21:51.700
POPULAR CORPORATIONS, AND ALSO,

21:51.767 --> 21:53.100
AS OF THIS WEEK, OUR PARENT

21:53.166 --> 21:55.266
COMPANY.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.400
SO GOOD-BYE, EVERYONE.

21:56.467 --> 22:01.934
IT'S BEEN FUN.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.533
AND, LOOK, IT GETS MUCH, MUCH

22:03.600 --> 22:05.200
DARKER HERE.

22:05.266 --> 22:06.166
IN FACT, XI'S CRACKDOWN ON HUMAN

22:06.233 --> 22:07.667
RIGHTS IS APPARENTLY "THE MOST

22:07.734 --> 22:14.033
INTENSE SINCE TIANANMEN SQUARE."

22:14.100 --> 22:14.767
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD, BECAUSE

22:14.834 --> 22:15.600
TIENANMEN SQUARE IS ON THE SHORT

22:15.667 --> 22:16.400
LIST OF PLACES SO INFAMOUS, YOU

22:16.467 --> 22:17.233
DON'T EVEN NEED TO DESCRIBE WHAT

22:17.300 --> 22:18.233
HAPPENED, LIKE CHERNOBYL OR

22:18.300 --> 22:19.066
JONESTOWN OR "THAT ONE

22:19.133 --> 22:20.066
CHEESECAKE FACTORY WE CAN'T GO

22:20.133 --> 22:22.033
TO ANYMORE."

22:22.100 --> 22:26.533
AND XI HAS INTENSIFIED

22:26.600 --> 22:28.233
GOVERNMENT SUPPRESSION OF

22:28.300 --> 22:28.900
CERTAIN RELIGIONS.

22:28.967 --> 22:29.600
IN ONE PROVINCE, CHRISTIANS

22:29.667 --> 22:30.533
HAVE BEEN TOLD TO TAKE DOWN THE

22:30.600 --> 22:31.266
IMAGES OF JESUS AND HANG

22:31.333 --> 22:32.467
PORTRAITS OF XI INSTEAD.

22:32.533 --> 22:33.066
SOMETHING I HAVE ALSO DONE BY

22:33.133 --> 22:33.867
THE WAY.

22:33.934 --> 22:35.934
SEE?

22:36.000 --> 22:36.667
I THINK IT REALLY TIES THE ROOM

22:36.734 --> 22:40.900
TOGETHER.

22:40.967 --> 22:41.834
IT'S A NICE ACCENT PIECE.

22:41.900 --> 22:42.567
AND A MUSLIM POPULATION KNOWN AS

22:42.633 --> 22:43.400
UIGHURS HAVE BEEN SINGLED OUT

22:43.467 --> 22:43.934
FOR DYSTOPIAN LEVELS OF

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
SURVEILLANCE AND PERSECUTION.

22:45.066 --> 22:46.133
HERE'S ONE MAN TALKING ABOUT A

22:46.200 --> 22:47.233
FORM THE GOVERNMENT HAD HIM FILL

22:47.300 --> 22:49.100
OUT.

22:49.166 --> 22:50.133
>> THIS PIECE OF PAPER WAS SENT

22:50.200 --> 22:51.633
TO EVERYONE.

22:51.700 --> 22:54.266
PEOPLE HAD TO FILL IT OUT.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.600
THEY ASK THINGS LIKE, IF YOU ARE

22:55.667 --> 22:57.166
UIGHUR, IF YOU HAVE A JOB, IF

22:57.233 --> 22:57.967
YOU HAVE A PASSPORT, IF YOU

22:58.033 --> 22:59.467
PRAY.

22:59.533 --> 23:00.700
ALL THESE ANSWERS WERE TURNED

23:00.767 --> 23:02.900
INTO A SCORING SYSTEM.

23:02.967 --> 23:04.467
THEY WOULD CATEGORIZE PEOPLE

23:04.533 --> 23:06.633
INTO SAFE, REGULAR, AND UNSAFE

23:06.700 --> 23:12.166
PEOPLE.

23:12.233 --> 23:13.834
>> John: THAT IS PRETTY

23:13.900 --> 23:15.500
CHILLING, BECAUSE GENERALLY

23:15.567 --> 23:17.100
SPEAKING, WHENEVER PEOPLE ARE

23:17.166 --> 23:18.500
PLACED ON LISTS, IT HAS NOT

23:18.567 --> 23:19.033
TURNED OUT WELL FOR ANYONE

23:19.100 --> 23:19.500
INVOLVED.

23:19.567 --> 23:20.200
MANY OF HISTORY'S GREATEST

23:20.266 --> 23:21.033
MONSTERS PUT PEOPLE ON LISTS:

23:21.100 --> 23:21.734
NIXON, THE NAZIS, SANTA.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.066
ALL OF THESE ANIMALS.

23:23.133 --> 23:23.967
AND SURE ENOUGH, IF YOU'RE

23:24.033 --> 23:25.367
DEEMED "UNSAFE" FOR WHATEVER

23:25.433 --> 23:26.767
REASON, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE,

23:26.834 --> 23:29.000
BECAUSE CHINA HAS INCARCERATED

23:29.066 --> 23:31.600
MUSLIMS IN RE-EDUCATION CAMPS

23:31.667 --> 23:33.400
WITH AS MANY AS 800,000

23:33.467 --> 23:35.300
INDIVIDUALS IN FACILITIES WHICH

23:35.367 --> 23:36.834
REPORTEDLY AIM TO REWIRE THE

23:36.900 --> 23:38.500
POLITICAL THINKING OF DETAINEES,

23:38.567 --> 23:41.033
ERASE THEIR ISLAMIC BELIEFS, AND

23:41.100 --> 23:43.000
RESHAPE THEIR VERY IDENTITIES,

23:43.066 --> 23:53.333
MAKING UNCLE XI LESS OF A FUN

23:53.400 --> 23:55.467
UNCLE AND MORE LIKE YOUR CREEPY

23:55.533 --> 23:56.867
UNCLE WHO IMPRISONS 800,000

23:56.934 --> 23:57.433
PEOPLE IN HIS BASEMENT.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.133
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT IT

23:58.200 --> 24:00.333
LOOKS LIKE WHEN "XI JINPING

24:00.400 --> 24:01.633
THOUGHT" GETS PUT INTO

24:01.700 --> 24:02.300
"XI JINPING PRACTICE," TAKE THE

24:02.367 --> 24:02.934
STORY OF NOBEL PEACE PRIZE

24:03.000 --> 24:03.567
WINNER LIU XIAOBO.

24:03.633 --> 24:04.233
HE WAS IMPRISONED IN 2009 FOR

24:04.300 --> 24:05.867
WRITING A PRO-DEMOCRACY

24:05.934 --> 24:06.467
MANIFESTO, AND LAST SUMMER, HE

24:06.533 --> 24:07.533
DIED IN STATE CUSTODY.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.700
AND EVEN CHINA SEEMED CONCERNED

24:08.767 --> 24:10.400
ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT LOOK.

24:10.467 --> 24:11.934
>> FEARING DOMESTIC BACKLASH,

24:12.000 --> 24:13.967
GOVERNMENT CENSORS WENT TO WORK.

24:14.033 --> 24:15.633
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS MENTIONING

24:15.700 --> 24:17.300
LIU'S NAME WERE DELETED, ONLINE

24:17.367 --> 24:19.233
SEARCHES WITH HIS NAME WERE

24:19.300 --> 24:20.767
BLOCKED, EVEN SIMPLE CANDLE

24:20.834 --> 24:22.433
EMOJIS WERE DEEMED ILLEGAL ON

24:22.500 --> 24:24.166
SOME SITES.

24:24.233 --> 24:25.900
CNN'S SIGNAL IN CHINA HAS BEEN

24:25.967 --> 24:27.533
CUT BY GOVERNMENT CENSORS EVERY

24:27.600 --> 24:33.266
TIME WE MENTION HIS NAME.

24:33.333 --> 24:34.600
>> John: EXACTLY, THE CHINESE

24:34.667 --> 24:35.834
MEDIA WOULDN'T ALLOW MENTIONS OF

24:35.900 --> 24:37.767
A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER'S

24:37.834 --> 24:39.000
NAME, WHICH IS A PRETTY INTENSE

24:39.066 --> 24:40.533
LEVEL OF CENSORSHIP, BUT IT IS

24:40.600 --> 24:42.200
ALSO MY PERSONAL POLICY TOWARDS

24:42.266 --> 24:43.433
GUATEMALAN ACTIVIST

24:43.500 --> 24:44.834
RIGOBERTA MENCHU.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.567
DO NOT BRING HER UP AROUND ME.

24:46.633 --> 24:50.266
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE DID.

24:50.333 --> 24:56.567
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID, RIGOBERTA

24:56.633 --> 24:56.834
RIGOBERTA!

24:56.900 --> 24:59.266
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS PIECE IS

24:59.333 --> 25:00.233
ABOUT.

25:00.300 --> 25:02.700
THE POINT IS -- THE POINT IS,

25:02.767 --> 25:03.900
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO LIU XIAOBO

25:03.967 --> 25:04.867
AND HIS WIFE -- WHO IS STILL

25:04.934 --> 25:06.000
UNDER HOUSE ARREST -- IS TRAGIC.

25:06.066 --> 25:06.667
ALTHOUGH TO HIS CREDIT, HE

25:06.734 --> 25:07.400
DIDN'T GO DOWN WITHOUT TAKING A

25:07.467 --> 25:08.367
FINAL SWING.

25:08.433 --> 25:10.734
>> ONE OF THE LAST KNOWN PHOTOS

25:10.800 --> 25:12.033
OF LIU WAS WITH HIS WIFE,

25:12.100 --> 25:14.200
LIU XIA.

25:14.266 --> 25:15.066
AT FIRST GLANCE, UNREMARKABLE,

25:15.133 --> 25:15.900
BUT NOTICE THE MUGS THEY'RE

25:15.967 --> 25:16.767
HOLDING.

25:16.834 --> 25:17.567
YEP.

25:17.633 --> 25:18.500
THAT'S WINNIE THE POOH ON THERE.

25:18.567 --> 25:19.533
PERHAPS A FINAL SUBTLE ACT OF

25:19.600 --> 25:23.033
DEFIANCE.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.500
>> John: YEAH, GOOD FOR THEM.

25:24.567 --> 25:28.133
GOOD FOR THEM.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.433
BECAUSE I THINK DEEP DOWN,

25:29.500 --> 25:30.300
WE ALL KNOW, WHEN YOU

25:30.367 --> 25:33.300
NEED TO TELL SOMEONE TO GO FUCK

25:33.367 --> 25:34.567
THEMSELVES, WHY NOT DO IT WITH A

25:34.633 --> 25:37.166
MUG?

25:37.233 --> 25:38.200
RIGHT?

25:38.266 --> 25:39.233
THE WHOLE POINT HERE IS, UNDER

25:39.300 --> 25:40.033
XI JINPING, CHINA IS BECOMING

25:40.100 --> 25:41.033
MORE AUTHORITARIAN, JUST AS IT

25:41.100 --> 25:42.300
HAS MAJOR PLANS FOR EXPANSION

25:42.367 --> 25:43.867
ONTO THE WORLD STAGE.

25:43.934 --> 25:45.133
SO THE ERA OF "HIDE AND BIDE" IS

25:45.200 --> 25:46.600
OVER, AND THE ERA OF "DO AS WE

25:46.667 --> 25:47.867
SAY" MAY BE DAWNING, BECAUSE

25:47.934 --> 25:49.266
CHINA HAS SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC

25:49.333 --> 25:53.367
LEVERAGE, AND IT'S BEEN USING IT

25:53.433 --> 25:54.467
TO SILENCE CRITICISM, EVEN WHEN

25:54.533 --> 25:58.033
CRITICISM IS WARRANTED.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.834
>> THE EUROPEAN UNION HARDLY

25:59.900 --> 26:01.767
SQUEAKS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS

26:01.834 --> 26:03.800
ANYMORE.

26:03.867 --> 26:05.467
CERTAINLY THE BRITISH DON'T.

26:05.533 --> 26:07.333
YOU DON'T GET MUCH ON TIBET

26:07.400 --> 26:09.000
EITHER BECAUSE WHENEVER ANYONE

26:09.066 --> 26:10.400
RAISES ANY OF THESE ISSUES,

26:10.467 --> 26:11.467
CHINA TURNS AROUND AND SAYS, "DO

26:11.533 --> 26:16.200
YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS OR NOT?"

26:16.266 --> 26:17.633
>> John: OF COURSE.

26:17.700 --> 26:18.433
CHINA KNOWS, NO MATTER HOW BADLY

26:18.500 --> 26:19.100
THEY BEHAVE, THE WORLD WILL

26:19.166 --> 26:20.033
STILL WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH

26:20.100 --> 26:20.667
THEM.

26:20.734 --> 26:25.467
THEY'RE LIKE FACEBOOK.

26:25.533 --> 26:27.233
"OH, I'M SORRY, YOU DON'T LIKE

26:27.300 --> 26:28.500
US MINING YOUR DATA AND

26:28.567 --> 26:29.166
UNDERCUTTING YOUR DEMOCRACY?

26:29.233 --> 26:29.867
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

26:29.934 --> 26:30.633
MAIL PEOPLE PRINTED-OUT PHOTOS

26:30.700 --> 26:31.500
OF MEALS YOU ATE?

26:31.567 --> 26:32.300
CALL YOUR FRIENDS AND TELL THEM

26:32.367 --> 26:33.200
HAPPY BIRTHDAY IN OUT-LOUD

26:33.266 --> 26:36.100
WORDS?

26:36.166 --> 26:37.033
I DON'T THINK SO.

26:37.100 --> 26:39.166
GO FUCK YOURSELF."

26:39.233 --> 26:42.000
AND HERE IS WHERE -- HAVING SET

26:42.066 --> 26:43.533
AMERICA ASIDE AT THE START -- WE

26:43.600 --> 26:45.066
SHOULD BRING IT BACK IN, BECAUSE

26:45.133 --> 26:46.800
IT'S ARGUABLY MORE IMPORTANT

26:46.867 --> 26:47.967
THAN EVER THAT AMERICA BE

26:48.033 --> 26:49.200
STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL ABOUT HOW

26:49.266 --> 26:50.200
TO DEAL WITH CHINA.

26:50.266 --> 26:51.633
SADLY, THOSE QUALITIES ARE NOT

26:51.700 --> 26:53.300
HALLMARKS OF THIS GUY, WHO

26:53.367 --> 26:54.734
COULDN'T PLAY CHESS FOR LONGER

26:54.800 --> 26:57.700
THAN 29 SECONDS WITHOUT

26:57.767 --> 27:00.333
SCREAMING, "MY HORSE EATS YOUR

27:00.400 --> 27:02.433
BIG LADY!" AND POURING NACHO

27:02.500 --> 27:03.700
CHEESE ALL OVER THE BOARD.

27:03.767 --> 27:04.667
TRUMP IS BLOWING UP THE

27:04.734 --> 27:09.166
TRADITIONAL ALLIANCES THAT HAVE

27:09.233 --> 27:10.333
HELPED INFLUENCE CHINESE

27:10.400 --> 27:12.967
BEHAVIOR ON IMPORTANT ISSUES,

27:13.033 --> 27:13.700
AND THAT'S BEEN GREAT NEWS FOR

27:13.767 --> 27:14.834
XI JINPING, AS HAS THE FACT THAT

27:14.900 --> 27:15.500
HUMAN RIGHTS DON'T SEEM TO BE A

27:15.567 --> 27:16.734
BIG TRUMP PRIORITY.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.700
IN FACT, JUST HOURS AFTER THE

27:18.767 --> 27:20.533
DEATH OF LIU XIAOBO, EVEN AS HIS

27:20.600 --> 27:22.700
ADMINISTRATION ISSUED

27:22.767 --> 27:24.000
CONDOLENCES, TRUMP HIMSELF SAID

27:24.066 --> 27:26.533
THIS:

27:26.600 --> 27:28.100
>> PRESIDENT XI IS A TERRIFIC

27:28.166 --> 27:30.066
GUY.

27:30.133 --> 27:31.133
I LIKE BEING WITH HIM A LOT.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.834
AND HE'S A VERY SPECIAL PERSON.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.333
>> John: WOW.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.834
THAT WAS NOT THE BEST TIME TO

27:35.900 --> 27:36.967
GIVE XI JINPING A PAT ON THE

27:37.033 --> 27:38.700
BACK.

27:38.767 --> 27:39.767
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF SAYING

27:39.834 --> 27:41.900
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE KEVIN SPACEY

27:41.967 --> 27:43.367
IN "AMERICAN BEAUTY" RIGHT NOW.

27:43.433 --> 27:48.700
FIRST, YOU SHOULDN'T.

27:48.767 --> 27:49.667
IT WAS OBJECTIVELY TERRIBLE.

27:49.734 --> 27:50.834
SECOND, YOU'RE PICKING THE WORST

27:50.900 --> 27:51.600
POSSIBLE TIME TO BRING THAT UP.

27:51.667 --> 27:56.934
THE POINT IS, TRUMP IS LEAVING A

27:57.000 --> 27:57.467
VACUUM ON THE WORLD STAGE

27:57.533 --> 27:58.934
AND CHINA IS MORE THAN HAPPY TO

27:59.000 --> 27:59.567
FILL IT BY TELLING THE WORLD ITS

27:59.633 --> 28:00.367
STORY AND LEAVING OUT SOME VERY

28:00.433 --> 28:01.233
IMPORTANT DETAILS.

28:01.300 --> 28:02.400
