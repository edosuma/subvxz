00:02.068 --> 00:04.901
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.005 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.319 --> 00:22.584
<i>Michael Bluth and his family were
meeting with their new attorney.</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:25.920
Look, this is not the first time I've been
brought in to replace Barry Zuckerkorn.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.256
I think I can do for you
everything he did...

00:28.361 --> 00:30.955
plus skew younger...
with juries and so forth.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.691
Any other questions?

00:32.799 --> 00:35.791
Yes. How can you be even cuter in person
than you are in your ads?

00:35.902 --> 00:38.393
<i>Are you a CEO, CFO or other executive...</i>

00:38.505 --> 00:40.803
<i>facing these or similar charges?</i>

00:40.907 --> 00:45.867
Why should you go to jail for
a crime someone else... noticed?

00:45.979 --> 00:49.745
You don't need double-talk.
You need Bob Loblaw.

00:49.849 --> 00:51.783
<i>Bob Loblaw</i> no habla espanol.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.445
Well, we're not here to talk
nonsense to Bob Loblaw.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.886
We need to find out if the government
has a good case against us.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.891
I mean, there is a lot of proof that
my father was building houses in Iraq.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.723
Well, your father claims he was
put up to it by a British syndicate.

01:02.829 --> 01:05.423
- And you've been threatened. Isn't that correct?
<i>- It was.</i>

01:05.532 --> 01:08.729
How would you like someone going after
some stupid person in your family?

01:08.835 --> 01:11.565
Now, back off, you !@%$# ponce!

01:11.671 --> 01:13.400
It's been a week.
Nothing's happened.

01:13.506 --> 01:16.600
Yeah, but you're not the one stuck
under house arrest like a sitting duck.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.609
Oh, yeah. That's my father.

01:18.711 --> 01:21.236
That's why we had the meeting
here... so he couldn't interfere.

01:21.347 --> 01:24.748
Interfere? I oughta pull down
your pants and spank your ass raw.

01:24.851 --> 01:27.251
I'm sorry.
Have we met?

01:27.353 --> 01:30.789
Oh, yes. This is Larry Middleman.
He's your father's surrogate.

01:30.890 --> 01:33.154
- Surrogate?
- That's right, you dumb !@%$.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.250
I hired this guy to wear
a camera in his hat...

01:35.361 --> 01:38.091
so he could be my eyes and ears
while I'm stuck in this penthouse.

01:38.198 --> 01:41.224
This camera helps me
keep tabs on you idiots...

01:41.334 --> 01:43.427
while this thing rubs my ankle raw.

01:43.536 --> 01:46.994
- I mean, look at this thing.
- I can't even go in the hallway...

01:47.107 --> 01:50.440
- Without hearing that...
- Beep, beep, beep.

01:50.543 --> 01:53.273
That's one of my partners.
Excuse me.

01:53.379 --> 01:55.745
Uh, I would like to be
one of your partners.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.647
Do you think he got that?
The two meanings?

01:58.751 --> 02:00.651
He's running pretty fast.
I think he did.

02:00.753 --> 02:02.653
Well, he was flirting earlier.
I'll tell you that.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.656
Just so you know,
I'm looking to get divorced.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.282
- Are you interested?
- Yes.

02:12.165 --> 02:14.133
Let's call that a half hour.

02:14.234 --> 02:17.203
- So you're not the only one who's got a date later.
- You've got a date?

02:17.303 --> 02:21.330
Her name's Rita. She teaches children at
a private school, and we're just having lunch.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.534
Oh, lunch. Well, you better
bring some dog food.

02:23.643 --> 02:27.204
All the girls you date are dogs.
Dogs love dog food, right, Pop?

02:27.313 --> 02:29.577
Shut up, you idiot.
I'm trying to watch the game.

02:29.682 --> 02:32.116
Just trying
to make you laugh, Dad.

02:32.218 --> 02:34.914
- It's all I ever wanted.
<i>- Smith the catcher...</i>

02:35.021 --> 02:37.751
You know, Gob, she's not a dog.
It's just the opposite actually.

02:37.857 --> 02:42.920
She's exquisitely beautiful. She's fun,
carefree, smart, full of surprises.

02:43.029 --> 02:46.430
<i>Including the fact that
she was working with this man...</i>

02:46.533 --> 02:48.865
<i>who was currently
dropping her off for her date.</i>

02:48.968 --> 02:52.267
Now all this fun and carefree act
is only gonna fool him for so long.

02:52.372 --> 02:56.035
- I'm a big girl.
- Yeah. Well, if he finds out what you really are...

02:56.142 --> 02:58.838
he might not make things
so simple for you.

02:58.945 --> 03:02.346
Rita, don't forget your hat.

03:06.319 --> 03:09.550
- Who am I kidding? She's too good for me.
- How do you think I feel?

03:09.656 --> 03:12.181
Bob Loblaw's a handsome,
professional man...

03:12.292 --> 03:14.886
and I'm only used to...
well, none of those things.

03:14.994 --> 03:18.054
Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting
that I was a professional twice over?

03:18.164 --> 03:21.895
An analyst and a therapist.
The world's first "analrapist."

03:22.001 --> 03:25.767
Yes, and you were almost arrested
for those business cards.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.399
Yes. No, it did not look good on paper, but
I didn't stop because of the police inquiries.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.636
I stopped to raise our little daughter.

03:31.744 --> 03:35.202
But since we both have started
to grow hair in unexpected places...

03:35.315 --> 03:38.148
I suppose I shall soon
be working as a leading man...

03:38.251 --> 03:40.412
and she may soon start dating.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.080
<i>Maeby had already started dating.</i>

03:43.189 --> 03:45.214
Another date with, uh, Steve Holt?

03:45.325 --> 03:47.452
Yeah. We're gettin' pretty serious.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.621
<i>They weren't. She was just avoiding her</i>
<i>real crush on George Michael.</i>

03:51.731 --> 03:53.596
That Steve sure knows
how to please a lady.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.500
Good. I was hoping
he would be gifted sexually.

03:57.604 --> 04:01.062
I guess it makes sense. You know,
uh, older guys expect certain things.

04:01.174 --> 04:04.268
- They do?
- What a fun, sexy time for you.

04:04.377 --> 04:06.777
I'd be very careful
of these British people.

04:06.879 --> 04:09.746
They're gonna try to get their hands
on any evidence they can to hurt the family.

04:09.849 --> 04:11.749
So you're saying shred the evidence?

04:11.851 --> 04:15.082
No, that's illegal. The prosecution
is entitled to that evidence.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.918
- Without it, they don't have a case.
- So shred the evidence?

04:18.024 --> 04:21.118
That's a felony. And I certainly couldn't
endorse anything like that.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.161
Got ya. Wink.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.697
Wink. Did you say wink?

04:25.798 --> 04:28.323
- Or did you wink?
<i>- He said that too, Dad.</i>

04:28.434 --> 04:30.299
We'll talk soon, folks. Thank you.

04:30.403 --> 04:33.099
Where are you going?
Where is the surrogate going?

04:33.206 --> 04:36.141
Stay there. I want to see what
he's gonna say. Don't leave.

04:36.242 --> 04:38.142
See ya, Pop.

04:38.244 --> 04:40.906
You know, Gob, instead of trying
to impress your fake father...

04:41.014 --> 04:43.175
maybe you should spend
some time with your real son.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.446
- Steve Holt's not my son.
- Steve Holt? The moron jock?

04:46.552 --> 04:48.986
That's my son, you pothead.

04:49.088 --> 04:52.615
- Hey, that's my son!
- Wait. So that means that Steve Holt is my cousin?

04:52.725 --> 04:56.286
- And Maeby's cousin too.
- I guess. Shoot, I'm late for my date.

04:56.396 --> 04:59.559
Yeah. At the kennel!

04:59.666 --> 05:03.898
You lobbed that one right over
the plate, Michael. Home run.

05:04.003 --> 05:07.200
<i>And Michael hurried to the British
section of Orange County for his date.</i>

05:07.307 --> 05:10.071
Crazy American!
Get out of the road!

05:10.176 --> 05:14.545
<i>Only to find that Rita had chosen Wee</i>
<i>Britain's one American-themed restaurant.</i>

05:14.647 --> 05:17.047
Oh, hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.984
Oh, no bother. I've been having
such fun on this spaceship.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.419
Strike one, huh?
Shall we go ahead and sit down?

05:27.527 --> 05:31.429
Hey, dudes, I'll get you
a couple of 64-ounce colas...

05:31.531 --> 05:33.761
to wash down
this basket of doughnuts...

05:33.866 --> 05:37.267
I guess this is what
the British think of Americans.

05:37.370 --> 05:40.032
- We like our food.
- Whatever do you mean?

05:40.139 --> 05:42.300
Yeah.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.899
Uh, you know, uh, Rita,
you're gonna figure this out eventually...

05:45.011 --> 05:47.571
but I have not been on a date
in a long, long time.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.240
- Neither have I.
- I wonder why.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.910
I'll bet men
ask you out constantly.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.386
Not men like you. I seem
to only meet little boys.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.616
Part of that might be that
you spend your day at a preschool.

05:58.725 --> 06:01.193
And they think the stupidest things are funny.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.762
Yeah, that's a cultural problem
is what it is, you know.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.696
Your average American male
is in a perpetual state of adolescence...

06:06.799 --> 06:08.699
you know,
arrested development.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.701
<i>Hey, that's the name of the show!</i>

06:10.803 --> 06:14.864
No attention span. You know,
can't even carry on a typical conver...

06:14.974 --> 06:18.273
<i>Michael thought he spotted the man
who'd threatened him earlier.</i>

06:18.378 --> 06:20.869
Well, I'm gettin' back
on the space shuttle.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.880
No, no, no. Sorry. Sorry.
Sit, please.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.746
Let's talk about you.
Tell me about your family.

06:25.852 --> 06:29.379
Well, they're pushy, bossy,
want to control me.

06:29.489 --> 06:34.051
What about your family?
I'd love to meet your family.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.650
<i>Michael knew from experience...</i>

06:35.762 --> 06:38.356
<i>that this would not turn out well.</i>

06:38.464 --> 06:42.230
Once or twice a week,
we get a...

06:42.335 --> 06:44.235
Have a little more.

06:44.337 --> 06:47.067
If you like the small, why don't
you come back for the medium?

06:49.175 --> 06:52.110
Right? You can see that, right?

06:52.211 --> 06:54.702
I probably should
warn you about my mother.

06:54.814 --> 06:57.681
- Hi.
- Let's start behind the fridge.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.480
<i>So he came up with
a solution so simple...</i>

07:00.586 --> 07:03.578
<i>he wondered why he'd
never told anyone it before.</i>

07:03.689 --> 07:06.487
I don't have a family.

07:06.592 --> 07:09.356
I can't believe I've never
told anybody that before.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.521
That's so sad.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.997
Yes, sad. Super sad.
Shall we eat?

07:18.304 --> 07:20.204
<i>Michael had started a relationship...</i>

07:20.306 --> 07:22.274
<i>by lying about the existence
of his family.</i>

07:22.375 --> 07:24.366
I think this went
really well, huh?

07:24.477 --> 07:27.105
- Maybe sometime we can have dinner?
- Could I see your house?

07:27.213 --> 07:29.875
<i>Michael was caught
off-guard by the question.</i>

07:31.184 --> 07:33.880
No. No. I... I can't do that.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.887
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Uh, bye.

07:36.989 --> 07:39.890
<i>And he vowed not to be
caught off-guard again.</i>

07:39.992 --> 07:42.552
I didn't mean that we...

07:42.662 --> 07:44.562
So did he invite you over, then?

07:44.664 --> 07:47.258
Not yet, but he will.

07:47.366 --> 07:50.199
<i>So Michael went back to work.</i>

07:50.303 --> 07:52.567
Hey, who brought in the wood...

07:55.842 --> 07:59.243
Gob, you can't shred this evidence.
You'll end up in jail.

07:59.345 --> 08:03.247
Dad told me to.
How can I say no to that face?

08:03.349 --> 08:06.841
Get this stuff out of here and put it
somewhere where Dad can't get to it.

08:06.953 --> 08:11.754
- Are you in on this too?
- No, I'm just here to go out
to lunch with your father.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.520
<i>And he said he's never
felt more free in his life.</i>

08:14.627 --> 08:19.257
<i>- I'm like a bird up there.</i>
- Did you tell him about my medal?

08:19.365 --> 08:22.459
- Medal? What for?
- Oh, who knows what they were saying.

08:26.272 --> 08:29.036
- Do you agree? Say thank you.
- Thank you. Wow.

08:29.141 --> 08:32.941
- I have so many people to thank.
- Private Asher, step forward!

08:33.044 --> 08:35.308
It's probably because
a seal bit off his hand.

08:35.414 --> 08:38.975
The army has taken to giving
medals for being food.

08:39.085 --> 08:41.952
- <i>Just then...
- Look at him go tied to that deck chair!</i>

08:42.054 --> 08:45.353
It's so simple.
My ankle monitor...

08:45.458 --> 08:47.790
only goes off when
I go out the front door.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.294
We need balloons.
A party!

08:50.396 --> 08:52.956
- We need to throw a party for...
- Buster's stupid thing.

08:53.065 --> 08:55.431
Larry, go get some balloons.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.595
<i>And Michael found a way
to get Rita to his house after all.</i>

08:58.704 --> 09:01.502
That's a great idea.
Honor Buster tomorrow night.

09:01.607 --> 09:04.371
We'll get the whole family over to
the penthouse, show him our support.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.571
Well, I suppose it's better
than drinking alone. What time?

09:07.680 --> 09:10.843
Doesn't matter to me. I can't be there.
I've got a date with Rita.

09:11.950 --> 09:15.319
Well, Mom's probably right.
I couldn't stand up to a seal.

09:15.421 --> 09:17.321
I don't really deserve
a medal or a party.

09:17.423 --> 09:20.358
No, you deserve this.
Here, take my business card.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.223
No, no. It's pronounced "a-nalra-pist."

09:23.329 --> 09:25.422
It wasn't really the pronunciation
that bothered me.

09:25.531 --> 09:28.989
You see, Buster, it wasn't the seal
that you couldn't stand up to.

09:29.101 --> 09:31.194
It was Lucille.

09:31.304 --> 09:34.137
Oh, I'm getting chills.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.868
If this was a Lifetime
moment of truth movie...

09:36.976 --> 09:38.876
this would be our act break.

09:39.978 --> 09:42.106
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

09:42.214 --> 09:45.513
<i>And later, Lindsay was</i>
<i>on the phone with Bob Loblaw.</i>

09:45.618 --> 09:48.815
I love Tobias, but he's
never fulfilled me sexually.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.889
Can you catalog
for me the various ways...

09:50.990 --> 09:52.890
you'd been promised to be fulfilled...

09:52.992 --> 09:55.153
whether or not said promise
was made explicit?

09:55.261 --> 09:57.388
- You want me to be explicit?
- Yes.

09:57.496 --> 09:59.794
But I will be needing
to get off in four minutes.

09:59.899 --> 10:03.528
<i>Well, let's see if I can't
hit that target for you.</i>

10:03.636 --> 10:06.127
<i>The next day,
on the way to pick up Rita...</i>

10:06.238 --> 10:11.107
<i>Michael stopped by his house to make sure
there were no signs of his family...</i>

10:11.210 --> 10:13.337
<i>only to discover there was nothing but.</i>

10:13.446 --> 10:16.381
- What the hell is all this?
- Gob brought all this stuff in.

10:16.482 --> 10:18.712
And, Mom, what is with
all the family photos?

10:18.818 --> 10:21.878
Oh, I'm teaching Buster
to stand up for himself.

10:21.988 --> 10:25.116
- I'm surrogating your mother.
- By wearing her sealskin coat?

10:25.224 --> 10:28.387
Michael, I have tried on everything,
and nothing seems to be working.

10:28.494 --> 10:31.588
I thought the Donna Karan worked.
You just didn't have the right shoes.

10:31.697 --> 10:35.394
Look, I've gotta get rid of any evidence
of my family, including you guys.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.401
Get outta here!

10:37.503 --> 10:39.937
See? Now, <i>that's</i> how
you stand up to Mother.

10:40.039 --> 10:42.007
<i>Meanwhile, worried about Steve Holt's...</i>

10:42.108 --> 10:44.941
<i>sexual expectations,
Maeby tried to cancel her date.</i>

10:45.044 --> 10:48.104
My whole family and I now have
to go to my grandma's house...

10:48.214 --> 10:50.114
- because my uncle lost his hand.
- Awesome!

10:50.216 --> 10:52.241
So you and I can party
alone at your house.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.945
<i>Maeby was too young
to know what to do.</i>

10:55.054 --> 10:58.649
<i>Ironically, in her after-school job
as a movie studio executive...</i>

10:58.758 --> 11:02.421
<i>she’d just green-lit two films
that dealt with the very issue.</i>

11:02.528 --> 11:05.258
- Rock the house.
- All right.

11:05.364 --> 11:07.832
<i>George Michael also
didn't know what to do.</i>

11:07.933 --> 11:11.061
<i>If he pointed out that the two
were cousins to drive them apart...</i>

11:11.170 --> 11:14.469
<i>he might be burning the very bridge
that he one day hoped to cross.</i>

11:14.573 --> 11:17.041
- I'm doing your cousin tonight.
- So are you.

11:17.143 --> 11:20.374
- What?
- She's your cousin too.

11:20.479 --> 11:24.006
<i>Back at the penthouse,
party preparations were under way.</i>

11:24.116 --> 11:27.483
He's not wearing that to the party.
I've got the exact same thing.

11:27.586 --> 11:29.986
No, he was just "analraping" me.
Then Michael barged in...

11:30.089 --> 11:32.785
and kicked us out so he
could shred all the evidence.

11:32.892 --> 11:35.326
- Shred the evidence?
- I thought he didn't want us to do that.

11:35.428 --> 11:38.886
He didn't want us to get into trouble.
He's taking the heat.

11:38.998 --> 11:42.627
He's doing that for us?
And on the night of his date with Rita.

11:42.735 --> 11:45.363
Who he didn't want to bring over here.
Probably because...

11:45.471 --> 11:48.531
let's face it... you people haven't been
great with the others.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.405
Well, in our defense, Mom,
we're not exactly dog people.

11:51.510 --> 11:54.570
- We've got to start being nicer.
- I'm starting right now.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.012
- Buster, the party's not for you anymore.
- Oh, okay.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.983
It's a "welcome Rita" party.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.486
I know where she works.
We can pick her up and surprise her.

12:02.588 --> 12:06.217
You're so right.
This is better than a party for me.

12:06.325 --> 12:09.089
Oh, come on. Grow a pair.

12:11.030 --> 12:15.126
You know, we need some weather balloons
for this party, and maybe a tank of hydrogen.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.101
You know, really float those suckers.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.172
<i>Meanwhile, Michael was hiding the evidence...</i>

12:20.272 --> 12:23.002
<i>wherever he could
when he heard from his brother.</i>

12:23.109 --> 12:26.476
<i>Hey, friend. Gob here.
We really want you at the party.</i>

12:26.579 --> 12:30.606
<i>We're really nice now.
And, God, we love you.</i>

12:30.716 --> 12:33.207
Damn it.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.844
<i>And the family picked up
Rita in the only vehicle...</i>

12:35.955 --> 12:38.253
<i>- big enough to hold them all.</i>
- Hey, hey. Excuse me. Rita?

12:38.357 --> 12:41.952
- I'm Rita.
- We're here to pick you up for Michael.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.188
Uh, you can just go in the cabin.

12:48.367 --> 12:51.768
- Michael?
- Oh, he's not here.

12:51.871 --> 12:55.238
- We're his family.
- Oh, his family.

12:55.341 --> 12:58.435
- We're nice.
- I'm sorry. I have to leave.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.876
Oh, no, you cannot leave.
Drive, Lindsay!

13:00.980 --> 13:03.949
- Bye!
- We're doing this for Michael.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.279
- Stop her, Buster.
- What am I supposed to do?

13:06.385 --> 13:09.548
- Stop her! - Stop yelling at me!
- I'm leaving!

13:09.655 --> 13:12.089
<i>And that's when Buster
noticed the seal on Rita's backpack.</i>

13:19.598 --> 13:22.795
Hey, talk about cathartic.
Now, <i>that's</i> an act break.

13:28.174 --> 13:30.574
<i>Buster had overcome his fear of seals.</i>

13:30.676 --> 13:34.271
<i>Unfortunately, he'd done so by
knocking out Michael's new girlfriend.</i>

13:34.380 --> 13:36.848
- What the hell did you do?
- You curious, Mom?

13:36.949 --> 13:39.747
- I can show you.
- Uh, you made a mistake.

13:39.852 --> 13:42.650
You're human.
Except for the hand.

13:42.755 --> 13:46.122
It's okay. She's alive.
And soft. Soft and alive.

13:46.225 --> 13:49.524
All right, let's not add that
to the charges. What'll we do?

13:49.628 --> 13:52.153
She's gonna tell Michael.
And he won't hear the good stuff.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.425
He'll just hear about the beating.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.764
Wait. Maybe we can give her
a "forget-me-now." Here you go, hot dog.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.338
- Take the pill.
- What's a forget-me-now?

14:00.439 --> 14:02.873
They're pills that create
a sort of temporary "forgettiness."

14:02.975 --> 14:06.308
If somebody finds out how you do a trick, you
give them one, and they forget the whole thing.

14:06.412 --> 14:08.642
- Oh.
- It's a mainstay of the magician's tool kit.

14:08.747 --> 14:11.113
Like how clowns always have
a rag soaked in ether.

14:11.217 --> 14:14.118
Gob, this is flunitrazepam.
It's a roofie.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.711
- Those are illegal!
- Shut up, Mom.

14:16.822 --> 14:18.881
Don't make me give you
another one of these.

14:20.492 --> 14:23.461
Lindsay, help me! Three!

14:27.099 --> 14:29.533
<i>Back at the house,
Michael finished his work...</i>

14:29.635 --> 14:31.569
<i>and, now late,
rushed to pick up Rita.</i>

14:31.670 --> 14:36.130
<i>Moments later, Maeby prepared to tell
Steve she wasn't ready for romance.</i>

14:36.242 --> 14:38.676
Well, this sends a mixed message.

14:38.777 --> 14:41.541
<i>Just as Steve showed up</i>
<i>to call things off with his cousin.</i>

14:41.647 --> 14:44.309
- You did all this for me?
- Yes.

14:44.416 --> 14:47.749
Well, I'm gonna go get sexy.

14:50.456 --> 14:53.016
<i>And Michael missed Rita.</i>

14:55.127 --> 14:58.358
Damn it. Strike two.

14:59.464 --> 15:02.093
Take it down. We don't want
anything that says Rita.

15:02.201 --> 15:05.102
<i>Hi. It's Michael.
I will be coming to the party...</i>

15:05.204 --> 15:08.196
<i>because I love you too.</i>

15:08.307 --> 15:10.832
Okay. We need a new banner.

15:10.943 --> 15:13.639
<i>And that's when Michael found Rita.</i>

15:13.746 --> 15:15.646
Rita.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.273
- Why am I on a bus bench, Michael?
- I get it.

15:18.384 --> 15:22.377
I'm sorry. But the rest of the night's
gonna be all about you, I promise.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.388
Great. Great.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.685
I am gonna have to make one quick stop,
maybe you'd just wait in the car.

15:26.792 --> 15:29.283
It's just gonna be
two seconds, I promise.

15:29.395 --> 15:32.228
<i>And so Michael raced up to pay
his quick respects to Buster.</i>

15:32.331 --> 15:35.027
Ah, there he is...
my favorite son.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.432
- Everybody's favorite son!
- Mr. Wonderful!

15:37.536 --> 15:40.869
Well, I had a great time.
I wish I could've stayed longer.

15:40.973 --> 15:44.033
This is a great party, huh?
Tell Buster I stopped by, please.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.134
- I do have to leave.
- Oh, no, no, no.

15:46.245 --> 15:49.305
The party is not for Buster anymore.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.315
- No, Michael. It's for you.
- Me.

15:51.417 --> 15:54.215
Take a look at banner, Michael!

15:54.320 --> 15:58.086
You guys did all of this for me?
"Family love"...

15:58.190 --> 16:01.250
- Michael?
<i>- Everyone froze.</i>

16:01.360 --> 16:04.887
<i>Michael feared he'd been caught
in a lie about his family.</i>

16:04.997 --> 16:07.056
<i>His family feared
they'd been caught...</i>

16:07.166 --> 16:10.966
<i>by a woman they clubbed,
drugged and left on a bench.</i>

16:11.070 --> 16:12.970
<i>It was awkward.</i>

16:13.072 --> 16:15.870
- Who's this?
- Mother! Mother!

16:15.975 --> 16:19.035
This is from the army.
I have to report for duty tomorrow!

16:19.144 --> 16:21.408
It says by accepting this
medal, I was reenlisting.

16:21.513 --> 16:23.413
I didn't hear them say that.

16:23.515 --> 16:26.040
<i>Perhaps if the sergeant had
spoken more slowly, she would have.</i>

16:26.151 --> 16:28.881
In acceptance of this medal, you proudly waive
all rights to private citizenship...

16:28.988 --> 16:31.513
and hereby reenlist in the armed services
of the United States.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.523
If you agree with this,
say thank you.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.991
Thank you.

16:36.095 --> 16:39.258
What am I gonna do?
I can't go back there. I've never been!

16:39.365 --> 16:42.493
- Who are these people?
- This is my family.

16:42.601 --> 16:45.035
No. No.
I don't like these people.

16:45.137 --> 16:48.106
Me. You mean... She means me.
Because I lied...

16:48.207 --> 16:52.109
about having a family, because
I was embarrassed by them.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.111
And I'm ashamed of that.

16:54.213 --> 16:56.113
I have to leave.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.882
Strike three.

17:00.986 --> 17:04.114
You said you didn't have a family?

17:04.223 --> 17:07.454
- Everybody's favorite son.
- Mr. Terrible.

17:09.994 --> 17:11.895
And her?
Too good for us? Huh.

17:11.997 --> 17:14.192
Buster, you should've
finished the job.

17:14.299 --> 17:17.564
- Job? What job?
- Did I say job? I meant Gob.

17:17.669 --> 17:21.002
Buster's the one that hit her.
I just gave her the roofie.

17:21.106 --> 17:22.868
- Roofie?
- Forget-me-now.

17:22.974 --> 17:24.875
You beat and drugged Rita?

17:27.780 --> 17:29.372
- Take this and love us again.
- No, no, no!

17:29.481 --> 17:31.540
- Just take it!
- No, Gob!

17:31.650 --> 17:33.914
Um, I'm leaving too.

17:35.587 --> 17:39.648
Well, no good deed
goes unpunished.

17:39.758 --> 17:41.726
Oh, look, it's not all bad.

17:41.827 --> 17:45.558
I got Buster feeling
better about his... medal.

17:45.664 --> 17:48.724
Not anymore.
I'm getting rid of this thing.

17:48.834 --> 17:52.099
It has caused me nothing
but pride and self-respect!

17:52.204 --> 17:54.331
<i>Buster went to get rid of the medal...</i>

17:54.440 --> 17:56.374
<i>he finally felt he deserved...</i>

17:56.475 --> 17:59.410
<i>but it was exactly when George Sr.
was making his escape.</i>

17:59.511 --> 18:01.672
Farewell to you all!

18:04.616 --> 18:08.177
<i>But it turns out that hydrogen
is more explosive than helium.</i>

18:17.863 --> 18:21.026
<i>And George Michael came home
to find an unconscious Steve Holt.</i>

18:21.133 --> 18:24.034
- What have you guys been doing?
- I gave him a roofie.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.070
A girl's gotta grow up sometime.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.537
- He's your cousin!
- My cousin?

18:28.640 --> 18:32.974
I should have told you that. Now you've
drugged him and had your way with him.

18:33.078 --> 18:36.809
- How is that even possible?
- No, George Michael. We didn't do anything.

18:36.915 --> 18:39.406
I just wanted him to think
we did. Don't you see?

18:39.518 --> 18:42.146
I drugged him <i>not</i> to go
all the way with him.

18:42.254 --> 18:45.815
Well, I think even the antidrug people
are gonna be okay with that.

18:45.924 --> 18:49.325
- Well, let's get his pants back on.
- You took his pants off?

18:49.428 --> 18:51.726
<i>And Michael tried to salvage...</i>

18:51.830 --> 18:54.162
<i>the remains of the files
from the car fire.</i>

18:54.266 --> 18:56.860
- You call the attorney?
- Yeah, but he's not taking our calls...

18:56.969 --> 18:59.062
because apparently
the retainer is all used up.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.833
He took my call.
He's very good.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.999
Yeah, that's how the retainer
got eaten up, okay?

19:04.109 --> 19:06.077
The secretary took it all
down here on a transcript.

19:06.178 --> 19:08.578
Ugh. She's very good too.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.513
<i>- I'm not paying for this.</i>
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

19:11.617 --> 19:15.986
I don't know, Lindsay. Thing you say on page
seven looks like it could be worth some money.

19:19.024 --> 19:21.356
- Speaking to me yet?
- It's only been an hour.

19:21.460 --> 19:25.658
Here's what I don't understand. What were
you guys doing with Rita in the first place?

19:25.764 --> 19:28.358
We just wanted to do
something nice for you, Michael...

19:28.467 --> 19:30.867
'cause you do so much for us.

19:30.969 --> 19:32.869
I guess we screwed it up.

19:32.971 --> 19:35.872
No, I screwed it up, 'cause
I was trying to impress her.

19:35.974 --> 19:38.340
Let's face it.
She's probably too good for me.

19:38.443 --> 19:41.776
No. What you need to do
is go to her and ask for another chance.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.610
She'd be lucky
to have you, Michael.

19:46.952 --> 19:49.716
Thanks, Gob.
Sometimes you do surprise me.

19:49.821 --> 19:52.289
I've got one more surprise for you.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.685
<i>It ain't easy being wh...</i>

19:56.795 --> 19:59.286
<i>And Michael did try again with Rita...</i>

19:59.398 --> 20:02.026
<i>but this time determined
to keep no secrets.</i>

20:02.134 --> 20:05.228
I wanna tell you everything,
if... if you're willing to listen.

20:05.337 --> 20:08.500
I'm a very good listener.

20:08.607 --> 20:11.974
Great. We'll start
with the misdemeanors...

20:12.077 --> 20:15.478
and then we're gonna push
right on through to the lighter treasons.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.776
So, 1983...

20:17.883 --> 20:20.647
<i>For British eyes only...</i>

20:23.422 --> 20:25.822
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

20:25.924 --> 20:28.825
<i>Lindsay tries to work off
her debt with Bob Loblaw.</i>

20:28.927 --> 20:30.986
I'm willing to debase myself.

20:31.096 --> 20:34.725
Get a maid's uniform
and come by my house around 7:00.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.164
No way to misinterpret that.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.168
<i>Except the one.</i>

20:42.274 --> 20:45.175
<i>And a traumatized Steve Holt
needs a father.</i>

20:45.277 --> 20:48.178
I've made a huge mistake.

20:50.382 --> 20:53.613
I know the feeling.
I had you.

20:54.853 --> 20:57.014
I'm your father, Steve Holt.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.215
I can't hide from it anymore.

20:59.324 --> 21:02.725
I won't forget this, Dad.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.866
I will.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.108
I will.
