10:34.792 --> 10:36.801
<i>Could Gary Drayton be correct</i>

10:36.960 --> 10:38.887
<i>that the team has
just found more evidence</i>

10:39.046 --> 10:40.972
<i>of a ship in the swamp?</i>

10:41.131 --> 10:44.643
<i>If so, might it also be
connected to the piece</i>

10:44.802 --> 10:47.303
<i>of believed ship's railing
found one year ago</i>

10:47.388 --> 10:51.224
<i>that dated to as early
as the seventh century AD?</i>

10:51.308 --> 10:54.903
<i>MARTY: I am surprised at
how much stuff is in that swamp.</i>

10:55.062 --> 10:58.448
Interesting things. I mean,
the paved area, the stone road.

10:59.825 --> 11:03.411
All the artifacts in
the southeast corner, and now,

11:03.496 --> 11:06.239
as we dig along the beach,
all kinds of pieces of wood.

11:06.323 --> 11:08.574
<i>Potentially significant
pieces of wood.</i>

11:08.668 --> 11:11.160
- Yeah. That's shaped wood for sure.
- GARY: Yeah.

11:11.245 --> 11:13.838
MARTY: "What's it mean?"
is the question.

11:13.923 --> 11:14.997
After we clean it up,
we might have a better idea

11:15.091 --> 11:16.675
- of what it actually is.
- Yeah.

11:16.834 --> 11:20.178
<i>MARTY:
All right, let's keep digging.</i>

11:25.092 --> 11:27.102
<i>NARRATOR:
The following morning,</i>

11:27.186 --> 11:29.429
<i>while operations continue
at the swamp...</i>

11:29.513 --> 11:31.597
(whoops)

11:31.682 --> 11:33.775
<i>NARRATOR:
and in the Money Pit area...</i>

11:33.934 --> 11:36.936
<i>RICK: Doug has come up with
a presentation which I find</i>

11:37.020 --> 11:38.438
intriguing, to say the least.

11:38.522 --> 11:41.282
<i>NARRATOR:
in the war room, Rick Lagina</i>

11:41.367 --> 11:44.202
<i>has gathered members of the team
to hear a presentation</i>

11:44.361 --> 11:46.362
<i>by Doug Crowell
that he has prepared</i>

11:46.447 --> 11:49.282
<i>regarding some
of their recent discoveries.</i>

11:49.366 --> 11:52.627
What encapsulates Oak Island
and the search for answers here,

11:52.786 --> 11:55.621
of course, is the "who, what,
where, when, why and how."

11:55.715 --> 12:00.051
Well, Doug has taken it upon
himself to address the "who."

12:00.136 --> 12:03.304
So, Doug, we will
turn it over to you, please.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.631
Yes, well, so,
what really kicked off

12:05.716 --> 12:07.633
this preliminary report

12:07.727 --> 12:11.721
is the finding of these
two round stones on the island.

12:11.805 --> 12:13.973
What was really interesting
about these is,

12:14.057 --> 12:16.067
these are not likely native
to Nova Scotia.

12:18.562 --> 12:20.146
GARY:
Whoa! Look at that!

12:20.230 --> 12:23.158
- It's a round shot!
- RICK: Wow.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.076
<i>NARRATOR:
Two months ago,</i>

12:25.161 --> 12:27.653
<i>while investigating
a possible ancient pathway</i>

12:27.747 --> 12:30.656
<i>between the swamp
and the Money Pit on Lot 16,</i>

12:30.741 --> 12:32.742
<i>Rick and Gary Drayton</i>

12:32.826 --> 12:36.746
<i>discovered a stone shot
or small cannonball.</i>

12:36.830 --> 12:40.500
<i>Incredibly, it was not only
nearly identical</i>

12:40.584 --> 12:44.921
<i>to one excavated
from the Money Pit in 2019,</i>

12:45.005 --> 12:47.340
<i>but when the team
had them analyzed</i>

12:47.424 --> 12:52.020
<i>by geology professor Dr. Robert
Raeside, in his opinion,</i>

12:52.179 --> 12:55.932
<i>one of the likely places
they originated was the Azores,</i>

12:56.016 --> 12:58.443
<i>a group of islands in Portugal.</i>

12:58.527 --> 13:01.604
These would classify as what
they'd call "two pounders".

13:01.697 --> 13:04.857
So, they'd be shot out
of a-a deck gun

13:04.950 --> 13:07.693
or a swivel gun, a rail gun
off the side of a ship.

13:07.778 --> 13:10.446
- Wow.
- And the Portuguese were the very first

13:10.531 --> 13:12.707
to put cannon
on board their ships.

13:12.792 --> 13:18.371
The stone shot came into play
around the early 1400s,

13:18.464 --> 13:21.216
and dwindled out of...
out of use in the mid-1600s.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.803
So, if these were from a ship

13:24.887 --> 13:27.463
or individuals
that visited Oak Island,

13:27.548 --> 13:30.308
and they had this type
of armament with them,

13:30.467 --> 13:32.477
that narrows the range
from, in my mind,

13:32.636 --> 13:36.055
from the 1400s
through to the very early 1600s.

13:36.139 --> 13:39.901
- That's very interesting.
- DOUG: The Portuguese

13:39.985 --> 13:41.903
and their exploration
along our shores

13:41.987 --> 13:43.896
make them one
of the early suspects,

13:43.989 --> 13:45.323
I think, in our mystery.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.407
- Oh, wow.
- LAIRD: The Portuguese

13:46.492 --> 13:48.484
have been coming over,

13:48.577 --> 13:50.411
I'm certain, for years.
Fishing.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.997
The question is, what else
might have they been doing here?

13:53.082 --> 13:55.500
How else might have they been
utilizing this area?

13:55.659 --> 13:57.168
Hmm.

13:57.327 --> 13:59.838
<i>NARRATOR:
According to documented history,</i>

13:59.922 --> 14:03.749
<i>Portuguese explorer
Joao Alvares Fagundes</i>

14:03.843 --> 14:07.428
<i>arrived on the shores
of Nova Scotia in 1520,</i>

14:07.588 --> 14:11.683
<i>referring to the area as
"The Land of the Cod Fish."</i>

14:11.842 --> 14:15.928
<i>Other Portuguese expeditions
would also lead</i>

14:16.013 --> 14:19.691
<i>to settlements in Cape Breton
and Newfoundland, in addition</i>

14:19.775 --> 14:24.112
<i>to their colonization
of large areas of Africa, Asia,</i>

14:24.271 --> 14:27.031
<i>and South America where
they collected vast amounts</i>

14:27.190 --> 14:29.692
<i>of gold, silver
and precious jewels.</i>

14:29.785 --> 14:34.030
<i>However,
over the past two years,</i>

14:34.114 --> 14:36.782
<i>the Oak Island team has made
numerous discoveries</i>

14:36.867 --> 14:40.703
<i>that suggest the Portuguese
also visited Oak Island.</i>

14:40.787 --> 14:43.539
<i>These finds include
the massive stone ship's wharf,</i>

14:43.624 --> 14:46.375
<i>uncovered one year ago
in the swamp,</i>

14:46.460 --> 14:49.545
<i>a fragment of a cannon on Lot 4,</i>

14:49.630 --> 14:53.391
<i>and along with the stone shot
found in the Money Pit area,</i>

14:53.475 --> 14:56.886
<i>evidence of wooden tunnels
that have been carbon-dated</i>

14:56.970 --> 14:58.563
<i>to between the late fifteenth</i>

14:58.722 --> 15:01.065
<i>and the early
seventeenth centuries.</i>

15:01.224 --> 15:03.318
You know, what's interesting
about that is,

15:03.402 --> 15:05.978
you know, we looked at French,

15:06.063 --> 15:09.815
we looked at British, but
we never looked at Portuguese.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.910
- No.
- No.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.903
<i>NARRATOR: If the
Portuguese were on Oak Island</i>

15:13.987 --> 15:15.905
<i>more than 200 years prior</i>

15:15.989 --> 15:17.907
<i>to the discovery
of the Money Pit,</i>

15:17.991 --> 15:20.501
<i>it begs the question,
was it merely</i>

15:20.586 --> 15:23.755
<i>for the purposes of creating
a fishing settlement?</i>

15:23.914 --> 15:27.091
So, what other evidence
do we have that

15:27.176 --> 15:29.677
the Portuguese were here
on our shores in Nova Scotia?

15:29.762 --> 15:33.848
<i>DOUG: Well, Professor
Ross Wilheim, in 1971,</i>

15:34.007 --> 15:37.602
<i>he thought that, after 1526,
the bulk of the gold and silver</i>

15:37.761 --> 15:39.854
<i>shipped to Europe
from the New World</i>

15:40.013 --> 15:42.941
<i>was moved in guarded convoys
of fleets of vessels.</i>

15:43.025 --> 15:45.017
<i>So when these treasure fleets
were making their turn</i>

15:45.110 --> 15:47.853
<i>towards the Azores,
if they encountered storms,</i>

15:47.947 --> 15:51.199
<i>the ships were driven towards
our coasts here.</i>

15:51.358 --> 15:53.701
<i>And they would need a place
to safe haven from the storm</i>

15:53.860 --> 15:56.195
<i>and a place to repair.</i>

15:56.279 --> 15:58.030
Well, you know,
we're finding items that suggest

15:58.123 --> 16:01.292
ship repair, both in
Smith's Cove and in the swamp.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.035
JACK: Well, if they were looking
for any place that was a great

16:03.128 --> 16:05.538
area to harbor out
for a while, they would have

16:05.631 --> 16:09.125
definitely come around
Oak Island and into Mahone Bay.

16:09.209 --> 16:12.378
Yeah. Actually, one of
the things we stumbled across

16:12.462 --> 16:15.640
was maps through the 1500s
into the early 1600s.

16:15.724 --> 16:19.802
And if you look here,

16:19.886 --> 16:21.479
if you see here on the coast
of Nova Scotia,

16:21.563 --> 16:24.315
this is Cape Breton,
Newfoundland.

16:26.059 --> 16:28.728
Here is some place called
"Port of Refuge,"

16:28.821 --> 16:32.824
which looks surprisingly
positioned to match Mahone Bay.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.743
The Portuguese, because
of their early exploration

16:35.828 --> 16:38.496
and looking for gold
in the New World,

16:38.580 --> 16:42.742
may have come to Nova Scotia
and found signs of gold here

16:42.835 --> 16:45.745
and were looking, actively
exploring for that gold,

16:45.829 --> 16:49.340
and needed a place
to process it or hide it away.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.260
- Interesting.
- We know they were here,

16:52.419 --> 16:54.262
- so that makes them a more likely suspect...
- Yeah.

16:54.421 --> 16:56.931
Than the... anyone we can't
prove was along our shores.

16:57.090 --> 16:58.182
RICK:
That's great.

16:58.267 --> 17:02.011
<i>NARRATOR:
Could Doug's theory be correct?</i>

17:02.095 --> 17:05.940
<i>Is it possible that while
transporting vast riches</i>

17:06.025 --> 17:09.360
<i>from South America back
to Portugal centuries ago,</i>

17:09.519 --> 17:13.114
<i>a Portuguese expedition
landed on Oak Island</i>

17:13.273 --> 17:16.358
<i>and constructed the man-made
workings in the swamp,</i>

17:16.443 --> 17:19.704
<i>as well as the Money Pit?</i>

17:19.788 --> 17:23.875
There's a lot of information
here that needs to be looked at

17:23.959 --> 17:26.461
much more in-depth,
all right, because

17:26.545 --> 17:28.120
who knows where this may lead?

17:28.205 --> 17:31.457
And the one critique I have is,

17:31.550 --> 17:33.709
we're supposed to be
putting Xs through people,

17:33.794 --> 17:35.795
- not creating more suspects.
- (laughter)

17:35.888 --> 17:39.390
<i>There certainly is
some historical narrative about</i>

17:39.549 --> 17:41.217
<i>the Portuguese having been
in the area.</i>

17:41.310 --> 17:43.052
<i>The other evidence, really,</i>

17:43.136 --> 17:45.137
<i>regarding a possible connection</i>

17:45.222 --> 17:46.972
<i>between the Portuguese
and Oak Island is compelling.</i>

17:47.057 --> 17:49.058
<i>But I think there's a lot</i>

17:49.142 --> 17:51.069
<i>of connective tissue
that needs to be developed,</i>

17:51.153 --> 17:53.237
if we really, truly want

17:53.322 --> 17:55.406
to understand
the Oak Island mystery.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.150
Oak Island mystery is all
about the search for the truth.

17:58.235 --> 18:02.246
And I applaud you
for bringing this to the fore.

18:02.331 --> 18:05.416
But eyes and boots approach,
there's a lot of work out back,

18:05.575 --> 18:07.493
- so let's get after it.
- All right.

18:07.577 --> 18:09.253
<i>PETER:
All right.</i>

18:13.342 --> 18:14.509
<i>MARTY: Okay, Steve. Bring us up
to date on the drilling.</i>

18:14.593 --> 18:16.677
So, as per Rick's instructions,

18:16.837 --> 18:19.597
we wanted to focus on the
western portion of the Money Pit

18:19.756 --> 18:22.341
- where Shaft Six could be.
- Right.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.426
<i>NARRATOR: After drilling
into what they believe</i>

18:24.511 --> 18:26.521
<i>are two walls of a 19th-century
searcher shaft,</i>

18:26.680 --> 18:28.430
<i>known as Shaft Six...</i>

18:28.515 --> 18:32.110
I've outlined this area.
So, we've defined the shaft.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.520
<i>NARRATOR: brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina</i>

18:34.604 --> 18:37.523
<i>meet with members of the team
in the research center</i>

18:37.607 --> 18:39.775
<i>to pick their next
drilling location.</i>

18:39.860 --> 18:44.446
<i>One they hope will intercept
a tunnel some 118 feet deep</i>

18:44.531 --> 18:47.783
<i>that could potentially contain
a debris field of treasure</i>

18:47.868 --> 18:52.371
<i>that resulted from a collapse
of the Money Pit in 1861.</i>

18:52.455 --> 18:55.049
STEVE G.: That's the next
step. Let's find the tunnel,

18:55.134 --> 18:58.294
- chase it to the Money Pit.
- Given Steve's plotting

18:58.387 --> 19:02.131
of the possible orientation,

19:02.215 --> 19:05.560
the tunnel could be driven
north right by F-4.

19:05.719 --> 19:08.813
We know that F-4 has produced

19:08.972 --> 19:11.149
high gold signature
in the water.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.142
If we move north,
we can possibly

19:13.235 --> 19:17.146
intercept the-the tunnel
off of Six,

19:17.239 --> 19:19.407
- if it's there.
- Mm-hmm.

19:19.566 --> 19:21.650
<i>NARRATOR: Earlier this
year, the team conducted</i>

19:21.735 --> 19:24.153
<i>water sampling tests
for precious metals...</i>

19:24.237 --> 19:25.413
That's it.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.239
<i>NARRATOR:
in a number</i>

19:27.332 --> 19:30.251
<i>of previously-drilled boreholes
across the Money Pit area.</i>

19:30.335 --> 19:33.671
<i>Incredibly, several
showed high concentrations</i>

19:33.755 --> 19:36.841
<i>of both silver and gold,
including Borehole F-4.</i>

19:38.335 --> 19:41.587
<i>Is it possible that F-4
intercepted the tunnel</i>

19:41.680 --> 19:45.516
<i>connected to Shaft Six
and the original Money Pit?</i>

19:45.675 --> 19:48.352
MARTY:
Where do you want to drill it?

19:48.437 --> 19:52.848
We have to stick somewhere
around F-4, maybe F-2.

19:52.933 --> 19:55.100
Somewhere around there.

19:55.185 --> 19:57.102
So, that's my hope.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.523
I would go south a foot,
and we'd call it F.25-4?

20:01.617 --> 20:04.443
I agree. It-it makes sense.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.537
- MARTY: Okay. - Yeah.
- DOUG: Historically,

20:06.696 --> 20:08.039
the Great Collapse
happened, right?

20:08.198 --> 20:10.282
And all that debris
from the Money Pit came down

20:10.367 --> 20:13.377
and flooded through
the tunnel to Shaft Six.

20:13.536 --> 20:16.464
So, if there's debris
from the treasure chamber

20:16.548 --> 20:18.791
in the Money Pit, it could
well be in that tunnel.

20:18.875 --> 20:21.377
That's coming
into our zone of interest.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.211
Heck, if that's
the debris field, I mean,

20:22.304 --> 20:24.639
that's a great spot for us.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.299
<i>RICK: Moving the
drill rig to the F line</i>

20:27.384 --> 20:29.143
is important because F-4 is

20:29.228 --> 20:31.896
where we got the highest
gold and silver signature.

20:32.055 --> 20:35.140
<i>And that's where
it becomes interesting,</i>

20:35.234 --> 20:37.735
<i>because the linear line
of water sampling,</i>

20:37.894 --> 20:40.813
<i>one could possibly
interpret that</i>

20:40.897 --> 20:43.574
<i>as the tunnel from Shaft Six.</i>

20:43.733 --> 20:45.818
I've always said
the debris field is

20:45.902 --> 20:47.995
where you'll find the one thing.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.666
I'm excited, so, uh, let's go,
uh, bore that hole.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.660
-Let's do it.
-Agreed. Enough talking. Let's go stake.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.912
- Yup. Yeah.
- Okay?

20:56.997 --> 20:59.748
<i>- ALEX: See you out there.

Yeah.

Yeah, a very, very
interesting piece.

24:32.378 --> 24:33.545
What do you have there?

24:33.630 --> 24:36.390
Metal. I don't know what it is.

24:36.549 --> 24:39.301
<i>NARRATOR: While searching

24:39.394 --> 24:40.886
<i>or tunnel entrance on Lot 4,</i>

24:40.979 --> 24:45.557
<i>Gary Drayton has just made a
potentially important discovery.</i>

24:45.650 --> 24:47.735
Wow. Look at that, mate.

24:47.894 --> 24:51.730
Actually, this kind of looks
like a massive iron staple.

24:51.823 --> 24:56.735
It looks like it's broken,
but this is definitely something

24:56.828 --> 24:59.997
that you would expect
to be in an old hatch.

25:00.156 --> 25:03.501
Oh! What time period
do you think that's from?

25:03.585 --> 25:06.337
More than likely,
it's pre-1830s.

25:06.496 --> 25:08.664
- This is what we're looking for.
- Mm-hmm.

25:08.748 --> 25:10.841
I don't feel there's a lot
of manganese in this.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.335
- For...
- Fits in with over by the swamp

25:13.428 --> 25:14.253
- and the Money Pit.
- Yeah.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.263
Chunky piece of iron.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.432
And it's in such
good condition, as well.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.352
But to me,
it looks like it's broken.

25:21.511 --> 25:23.187
And if you was looking
for a hatch,

25:23.271 --> 25:26.774
uh, I'm assuming the hatch is...
got some wood on it.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.350
If it is a wooden hatch,
it would have one of these

25:28.443 --> 25:30.852
- in for sure.
- Mm-hmm.

25:30.946 --> 25:35.616
<i>NARRATOR: An iron staple

<i>but also potentially connected</i>

25:45.702 --> 25:47.286
JACK Well, we're gonna
have to find some more

25:47.370 --> 25:48.453

what went on here.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.880
GARY:
Yeah, obviously,

25:49.965 --> 25:52.550
- we are not the first people out here.
- Exactly.

25:52.709 --> 25:54.293
STEVE G.: We still have more
locations to check.

25:54.377 --> 25:58.138
- So, that's a positive sign.
- GARY: Yup.

25:58.298 --> 26:00.891
So, going to keep continuing
the search, and hopefully,

26:01.050 --> 26:02.217
there's some more items
like this.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.644
- Yeah.
- JACK: This is something

26:03.728 --> 26:04.970
- we need to bag.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.138
I'll take it to Steve,

- and then you keep going, and...
- Okay, mate.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.733

26:40.432 --> 26:43.759
<i>A borehole that they hope

26:43.852 --> 26:47.262
<i>some 118 feet deep

<i>to contain a debris field
of treasure</i>

26:49.432 --> 26:52.184
<i>connected
to the original Money Pit.</i>

26:52.277 --> 26:55.029
TERRY: We're only about
a foot away from F-4 there.

26:55.188 --> 26:58.115
If that is indeed Shaft Six and
the tunnel coming off of that,

26:58.199 --> 27:00.692
maybe that could account
for the high

27:00.785 --> 27:03.945
gold and silver readings
we're getting in F-4.

27:04.030 --> 27:06.290
Exactly.
Part of the smashed-up treasure

27:06.374 --> 27:08.292
or a vault
that has fallen and shot

27:08.451 --> 27:09.793
- into the Shaft Six tunnel.
- Yeah.

27:09.952 --> 27:11.453
<i>MARTY:
There could be a tunnel</i>

27:11.537 --> 27:12.871
<i>between the shaft
and the Money Pit area.</i>

27:12.955 --> 27:14.632
<i>So, we're looking for it.</i>

27:14.791 --> 27:17.217
<i>And the collapse
of the Money Pit.</i>

27:17.377 --> 27:22.214
<i>The water samples show the most
gold and silver right there, so,</i>

27:22.307 --> 27:24.725
we think we're zeroing in
on potentially at least part

27:24.809 --> 27:26.644
of the treasure.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.979
- CHARLES: We got another core coming.
- Yup.

27:30.890 --> 27:32.891
- 119.
- 119.

27:32.975 --> 27:34.151
Yup.

27:36.988 --> 27:40.240
Look at this, Charles.
This is really mixed up.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.068
In terms of constituents,
it's all till.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.912
But look at the wood and chips
and chunks through it.

27:45.071 --> 27:46.655
- Yeah.
- That's not at the periphery or the outside.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.156
It's right in the core
and center.

27:48.249 --> 27:51.910
This is definitely
clumps and chunks

27:52.003 --> 27:56.590
of material that
was dug out, mixed with clumps

27:56.749 --> 27:59.835
of sticks and twigs that
fell in between the clumps.

27:59.919 --> 28:03.097
It's partially backfill
and partially

28:03.181 --> 28:05.015
dug material.

28:05.174 --> 28:08.769
So... we did not
intersect a tunnel.

28:08.928 --> 28:12.681
That doesn't mean it's not
there. We just didn't hit it.

28:12.765 --> 28:14.191
We just didn't hit it.
That's right.

28:15.527 --> 28:19.780

<i>of both silver and gold

not have missed by much.</i>

<i>in the area just
a few short weeks from now,</i>

to stay the course and</i>

28:59.812 --> 29:00.979
<i>from that work, we'll be able</i>

TERRY: At least we
know exactly where it isn't.

So, we can move over
and see if we hit it

29:11.324 --> 29:13.917
- just a little further to the east or west.
- Okay.

just come ahead,

31:36.561 --> 31:38.228
just come right ahead
in front of the bucket.

31:38.387 --> 31:40.814
There's a small
little pointy piece.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.149
- This?
- Yeah.

- That's a nice piece, Gary.

31:51.659 --> 31:53.160
GARY: I mean, yeah,
you can definitely tell

31:53.244 --> 31:54.402

Well, we don't know, mate.
Some kind of wooden plug.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.604
- Huh.
- Or a pin.

32:20.763 --> 32:23.848
Yeah. You can see
it's square here,

32:23.933 --> 32:25.850
and then someone's
carefully tapered it.

32:25.935 --> 32:29.279
Yeah. It's-it's just got
a nautical feel to it.

32:29.438 --> 32:30.697
Yeah.

32:30.856 --> 32:34.284
- And you see the beveled edges on the side?
- Yup.

32:34.443 --> 32:36.870

- Thank you.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.347
(engine starts)

33:43.345 --> 33:45.772
I don't know about that.
Looks more like bark.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.442
- Yeah.
- I think we're barking up the wrong tree with that one.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.623
What is this?

34:05.117 --> 34:07.202
That's a pretty smooth piece
of wood right there.

34:07.295 --> 34:10.371
GARY:
Oh, wow. It's interesting. Look.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.791
That looks like it was cut.

34:12.884 --> 34:17.137
But why would anybody ever
cut something in that way?

34:17.221 --> 34:18.889

34:26.388 --> 34:27.731
We're hoping
you can tell us, mate.

34:27.890 --> 34:29.808
First impression:
it looks like it's a...

34:29.892 --> 34:32.069
a knot broken out
of a trunk of a tree.

34:32.228 --> 34:33.737

Wow.

34:33.896 --> 34:35.396
SCOTT:
But it's clearly been cut.

34:35.490 --> 34:38.900
You ever seen anything
like that?

34:38.993 --> 34:42.737
No. It almost looks carved.

34:42.822 --> 34:45.573
Yeah. It looks like it's been
cut on the top and the bottom.

34:45.666 --> 34:47.918
Yeah. Could it be
part of a tool?

34:48.077 --> 34:49.911
- LAIRD: Could well be.
- GARY: Yeah.

34:50.004 --> 34:51.922
Almost reminds me of, like,

34:52.081 --> 34:54.424

we found in the swamp.

34:54.583 --> 34:57.085

- LAIRD: Yeah.

<i>GARY:

35:58.739 --> 36:02.400
<i>and obviously,
it had some kind of purpose.</i>

36:02.493 --> 36:06.404
And recovering pieces
of shaped wood is important

36:06.488 --> 36:09.749
because this area
is very close to the area

36:09.909 --> 36:13.837
where we recovered that piece
of ship's rail last year.

to, you know,
the swamp road, right?

36:18.667 --> 36:20.752
So, I mean,
it's a fair thought to think

36:20.845 --> 36:23.346
that the road was used
for a boat of some sort,

36:23.505 --> 36:25.173

in the good zone.

Hell of a lot
of interesting pieces, as well.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.765

37:10.886 --> 37:12.896
Maybe as woodworking people,

37:13.055 --> 37:14.898
you'll have a little
more insight into it.

37:19.820 --> 37:22.405

- Hmm.

37:22.564 --> 37:23.740
Hmm.

37:26.318 --> 37:29.746

I have no idea what that is.

37:29.830 --> 37:31.498
When you first handed it,
I said,

37:31.582 --> 37:34.334
- part of a piece of furniture.
- Yup.

37:34.493 --> 37:36.995
No. You know, looks like
something must've that stained

37:37.088 --> 37:39.089
or something was around.

37:39.248 --> 37:40.590
Could a rope maybe
have done that?

37:40.749 --> 37:44.511
Yeah, it does almost look
like a rope rubbing on the...

37:44.670 --> 37:46.680
that one portion, under the lip.

37:46.839 --> 37:48.840
RICK: I'd say you're
right. That's a rope burn.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.258
- TOM: That's what I think it is. Yeah.
- RICK: Yeah.

37:50.351 --> 37:53.186
Yeah. That's quite possible.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.689
Then it's not furniture.
To me, that looks maritime.

37:55.848 --> 37:58.692
BILLY: It's all in the general
range of where we found, uh,

37:58.851 --> 38:00.277
the ship's rail last year.

is gonna take a while.

38:16.535 --> 38:18.369
Mm-hmm. I think that's a much
denser piece of wood...

38:18.462 --> 38:21.298
- BILLY: Yeah.
- Because it's-it's already dry.

38:21.457 --> 38:23.624
Yeah, so we talked
about C-14 dating,

38:23.709 --> 38:25.043
- but maybe we should look at...
- I think we should look

38:25.127 --> 38:27.220
- at species on that one.
- Yeah.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.555
'Cause if it is
some exotic species,

38:28.639 --> 38:30.390
that might tell us
something, too.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.975
Yeah, for sure.

38:32.134 --> 38:34.135
Well, we're kind of,
um, overwhelmed

38:34.219 --> 38:35.887
by the stuff coming out
of the swamp.

38:35.971 --> 38:37.305
You know, they used
to use black locust

38:37.398 --> 38:41.067
- or something really hard to-to wind ropes around.
- Yeah.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.310
<i>MARTY: You know,
they're pieces of wood.</i>

38:42.394 --> 38:43.978
<i>They're human-shaped.</i>

38:44.063 --> 38:45.897
<i>The swamp preserves them</i>

38:45.981 --> 38:47.490
<i>for literally hundreds of years.</i>

38:47.575 --> 38:49.159
So we need
to get everything tested

38:49.318 --> 38:52.236
to see how old the old is
and separate out the new.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.914
Anyway, the last one--
It's a worked piece of wood.

38:54.999 --> 38:58.418
Um, almost like it was meant
to be inserted partway.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.495
So, possibly nautically related.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.997
BILLY:
So, you know, it could've been,

39:03.082 --> 39:04.665
uh, you know,
to hang your rope on.

39:04.750 --> 39:06.760
How deep was that, Billy?

39:06.919 --> 39:08.920
Two to three feet, probably.

39:09.013 --> 39:12.924
We're just getting into the
original surface of the swamp.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.926
I have to give you guys
credit to find this.

39:15.010 --> 39:16.094
- ALEX: Yeah.
- In one of those big buckets.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.105
I mean, it is
a pretty interesting piece,

39:19.190 --> 39:21.099
and it would have
been very hard to find.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.860
Well, I mean, every time
we've gone into that swamp,

39:24.019 --> 39:26.696
we've found answers.
Unfortunately,

39:26.855 --> 39:28.531
don't give us
all the answers, but

39:28.616 --> 39:31.526

40:35.015 --> 40:36.266
<i>- TOM: Thanks, guys.

40:36.425 --> 40:38.852
<i>NARRATOR:
Another historic week has</i>

40:39.011 --> 40:41.354
<i>come to an end on Oak Island.</i>

40:41.513 --> 40:44.849
<i>And even though Rick, Marty,
Craig, and their team</i>

40:44.942 --> 40:48.936
<i>still struggle to decode
the mystery of the Money Pit,</i>

40:49.021 --> 40:53.191
<i>the discoveries that they keep
unearthing all across the island</i>

40:53.275 --> 40:55.118
<i>only strengthen
their resolve to believe</i>

40:55.277 --> 40:58.288
<i>it will all be worth it
in the end.</i>

40:58.372 --> 41:03.293
<i>As they keep drilling
and digging for clues,</i>

<i>that people have been
searching for since 1795,</i>

41:10.968 --> 41:15.221
<i>or are those efforts
leading them</i>

<i>to their greatest challenge
and test of will yet?</i>

41:23.639 --> 41:26.307

The Curse of Oak Island...

41:26.400 --> 41:27.892

41:32.731 --> 41:35.149
This is a tool that you would
use for moving items.

41:35.242 --> 41:36.234
Bring your heavy stuff to shore,

41:36.318 --> 41:37.735
- then you move it with that.
- Yes.

41:37.819 --> 41:39.829
<i>JEREMY:
This tunnel, next with this</i>
