07:38.413 --> 07:40.145
<i>I thought this was going to be hard,</i>

07:40.214 --> 07:42.114
<i>but it turns out ning up a date is easy.</i>

07:42.182 --> 07:43.702
Don't I need your number or something?

07:43.718 --> 07:45.618
Yeah. No, yeah, definitely you do.

07:45.686 --> 07:47.986
<i>All right, not that easy.</i>

07:48.055 --> 07:49.587
[Chuckles]

07:55.743 --> 07:57.343
What did Mom say about showers?!

07:57.412 --> 07:59.812
I just needed a band-aid, okay?

07:59.880 --> 08:02.780
I've got a million splinters
from reworking that float!

08:02.849 --> 08:06.384
Using my hands for other
things has been very dangerous.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.586
Okay, what do you think?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.354
I'm hoping this says
I'm edgy, confident,

08:09.423 --> 08:10.888
but also like to cuddle.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.091
It kind of smells like Grandpa.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.193
What do I know? It's
got a boat on the bottle.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.696
I've never done this before.
I'm kind of freaking out.

08:17.764 --> 08:18.930
You've been on dates before.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.864
With Mimi, and she was
into me no matter what.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.266
I mean, we'd just be,
like, playing cards,

08:22.335 --> 08:24.568
and then, you know, before you
knew it, her shirt was open...

08:24.637 --> 08:26.870
I want you to stop!

08:26.939 --> 08:28.939
And now I want you to keep going.

08:29.007 --> 08:31.242
I'm so sorry. That was thoughtless.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.677
I just... I need a pep talk.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.879
You're gonna do great, okay?

08:35.948 --> 08:38.214
The only thing I am confused about

08:38.283 --> 08:40.250
is who pays on a guy-guy date?

08:40.318 --> 08:41.717
Oh, yeah. I don't know that, either.

08:41.753 --> 08:42.885
Right?

08:42.953 --> 08:44.220
And if you were lesbians,

08:44.289 --> 08:46.088
does that mean nobody would pay?

08:46.157 --> 08:47.257
[Door opens]

08:47.325 --> 08:49.024
No, that doesn't sound right.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.360
What's going on?

08:50.428 --> 08:52.194
Smells like the Yankee Candle Company.

08:52.264 --> 08:53.462
That sounds judgmental.

08:53.530 --> 08:56.365
I like each candle separately,

08:56.433 --> 08:59.033
but all together, it's
an assault on the senses.

08:59.102 --> 09:01.370
That's not judgmental.
That's just a fact.

09:01.438 --> 09:03.372
Speaking of lenten vows,

09:03.440 --> 09:04.640
is there something
you'd like to tell me,

09:04.708 --> 09:05.940
Mr. Button-Down Shirt?

09:06.009 --> 09:07.643
I'm going to confession.

09:07.711 --> 09:09.210
Confession?

09:09.280 --> 09:10.640
When's the last time you did that?

09:10.647 --> 09:13.213
I want to get serious about atoning.

09:13.283 --> 09:14.649
Interesting.

09:14.717 --> 09:16.484
Well, you know, I'm gonna
see Father Phil tomorrow

09:16.552 --> 09:18.152
at the parade, so I'll
just ask him about it.

09:18.220 --> 09:21.955
Just a reminder. C...
confession is confidential.

09:22.024 --> 09:24.992
So even if I kill
someone, he can't tell you.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.827
Mm. That's true.

09:26.896 --> 09:31.097
And you just remember...
god is always watching.

09:32.233 --> 09:33.400
No!

09:33.468 --> 09:35.335
I just wanted to hear it, Mom.

09:37.071 --> 09:38.838
Okay, what do we got?

09:38.907 --> 09:40.973
Oh, a lot of options, huh? [Chuckles]

09:41.042 --> 09:45.010
We've got pearls, wings, flex foam.

09:45.078 --> 09:46.244
Hmm, what feels lucky?

09:46.314 --> 09:48.814
Early-onset menopause.
That feels pretty lucky.

09:48.882 --> 09:50.182
Let's read the back.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.750
"Toxic shock." Nope.

09:51.819 --> 09:53.686
Excuse me, sir.

09:53.754 --> 09:54.653
Yeah?

09:54.722 --> 09:56.021
My daughter here is

09:56.089 --> 09:57.323
experiencing her first period,

09:57.391 --> 09:59.858
and I'm helping her out all on my own.

09:59.927 --> 10:02.259
Uh, these are the ones my daughter used.

10:02.329 --> 10:03.594
She loved them.

10:03.663 --> 10:05.963
Yeah? He likes these.

10:06.032 --> 10:07.465
Oh, my god.

10:07.534 --> 10:08.534
You're being a good dad.

10:08.568 --> 10:10.034
She's not a little girl anymore.

10:10.102 --> 10:11.769
Before you know it,
she's off to college.

10:11.838 --> 10:14.339
There's so much I
haven't taught her yet.

10:14.407 --> 10:16.774
Shannon, you're a woman now.

10:16.843 --> 10:19.776
I'll be waiting for you
in the trunk of the car.

10:19.845 --> 10:21.378
Little girl's growing up.

10:21.447 --> 10:24.013
You got to give her the
tools she needs to leave you

10:24.082 --> 10:25.882
and survive in the real world,

10:25.951 --> 10:28.051
before it's too late.

10:28.119 --> 10:30.053
Wow.

10:30.121 --> 10:33.523
Two vegan raw apple pies.

10:33.592 --> 10:34.458
Ricky: Thanks.

10:34.526 --> 10:35.858
Enjoy.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.125
[Gulps] Ugh.

10:37.194 --> 10:39.962
<i>Whoever called this apple pie is a liar.</i>

10:40.030 --> 10:42.398
<i>It's like someone sneezed in my mouth.</i>

10:42.467 --> 10:44.867
Um, so, your parents...

10:44.935 --> 10:47.069
they're... they're cool
with you being gay and vegan

10:47.137 --> 10:49.739
and getting petitions
signed in parking lots?

10:49.807 --> 10:51.374
Yeah, my parents live in a tree.

Yours?

10:53.543 --> 10:54.976
- Hmm.
- And my mom...

10:55.044 --> 10:56.678
she's not really cool with anything.

10:56.747 --> 10:58.246
She doesn't know I'm on this date.

10:58.314 --> 11:00.348
This is actually my
first date with a guy.

11:00.417 --> 11:01.649
- Mm.
- Am I going overboard?

11:01.718 --> 11:03.385
I wouldn't know 'cause
it's my first time

11:03.453 --> 11:04.986
going overboard on a date with a guy.

11:05.054 --> 11:06.187
I think if you tell the waitress,

11:06.256 --> 11:07.355
she'll give you a free artichoke.

11:55.702 --> 11:56.701
and... boom... you're dead in a ditch.

11:58.004 --> 11:59.270

because you were right.

11:59.339 --> 12:01.204
Leprechaun costumes
are for little girls.

You're a woman now, so I have
to teach you some adult things,

12:04.176 --> 12:05.976
like choke holds and
how to change a tire.

12:06.045 --> 12:07.045
I can't even drive yet.

get stranded, and...
boom... dead in a ditch.

- Well, I have to

12:10.953 --> 12:12.006
teach you this stuff.

12:12.051 --> 12:13.083
Not all in one day.

out that it happened.

on-the-nose, don't you think?

Like, braid each other's hair?

13:01.564 --> 13:02.864
Yes! Yes!

13:02.932 --> 13:04.832
They literally did that
right before the pillow fight!

13:04.901 --> 13:06.300
But I'm not... I'm not
gonna take a shower, though,

13:06.369 --> 13:08.469

keep working on the float.

keeping secrets anymore.

What are you doing with all this yarn?

13:53.212 --> 13:54.212
Nothing.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.680
Really?

13:55.749 --> 13:58.482
Because it looks like you're
using it to knit a web of lies.

13:58.552 --> 14:01.018
You went back to the
craft store, didn't you?

14:01.086 --> 14:02.285
Fine.

to stop keeping secrets.

Come on!

14:17.001 --> 14:19.101
The only reason that
you went all lent crazy

14:19.170 --> 14:21.103
was because you saw
Ricky and I flirting.

- [Scoffs]
- I mean, what you

14:22.109 --> 14:23.129

14:47.981 --> 14:49.847
That is your period tool kit.

14:49.916 --> 14:52.817
It's got ibuprofen, a little chocolate.

14:52.886 --> 14:54.919
I read a "Cathy" comic strip
that said chocolate helps.

14:54.988 --> 14:57.422
And a drugstore gift card

14:57.491 --> 14:58.756
because you should be in charge

14:58.825 --> 15:01.759
of your own feminine...

Wingy things.

Where's Shannon?

15:21.480 --> 15:23.346
Eh, she's not feeling too great.

15:23.415 --> 15:24.880
I think she's gonna stay home.

15:24.949 --> 15:26.182
What's the matter with her?

15:26.251 --> 15:28.418
Well, uh, she told me
not to tell you this,

15:28.487 --> 15:29.619
but she got her period.

15:29.687 --> 15:31.721
She didn't want to tell me?

15:31.789 --> 15:33.055
But I'm her mother!

15:33.125 --> 15:34.757
I know. And don't worry. I handled it.

15:34.826 --> 15:36.225
And it did happen in my basement,

15:36.293 --> 15:38.026
and you said to handle
things down there.

15:38.095 --> 15:40.929
Yeah, but not when it's
our daughter's "down there."
