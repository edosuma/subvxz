00:07.008 --> 00:09.428
We're at war, John. The
human mind, it seems,

00:09.476 --> 00:11.278
is the new battlefield.

00:11.311 --> 00:12.831
If we're gonna win, we can't be afraid

00:12.855 --> 00:14.488
to match our enemies'
level of brutality.

00:14.521 --> 00:15.582
Track Petra down.

00:15.613 --> 00:16.893
I have no idea where she is now.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.117
Sources tell me that you were
seen with her in Budapest.

00:19.150 --> 00:20.350
I'd start there if I were you.

00:20.374 --> 00:21.688
I need to know everything

00:21.722 --> 00:22.962
about this woman, Tara Coleman.

00:22.986 --> 00:24.124
She's a journalist.

00:24.157 --> 00:25.792
She believes that a decommissioned nuke

00:25.826 --> 00:27.461
known as Stiletto Six

00:27.494 --> 00:29.329
ended up on the black market.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.283
This was full of holes,
she lost all credibility.

00:31.307 --> 00:34.668
The encryption key to access those funds

00:34.701 --> 00:36.303
is on this flash drive.

00:36.336 --> 00:38.438
Purchase those launch codes.

00:38.472 --> 00:39.740
- Tara?
- I'm going to Ghana

00:39.773 --> 00:42.776
because I need to set the story
straight about Stiletto Six.

00:42.809 --> 00:44.044
I can't sanction this.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.512
I'm not asking for your sanction.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.199
- What did they tell my mother?
- Agency protocols.

01:08.223 --> 01:10.437
So she thinks I'm dead?
I was only gone a week.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.272
John, you were missing for nine months.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.141
You are an asset for the CIA.

01:14.174 --> 01:15.774
She's your target. If you don't complete

01:15.798 --> 01:17.017
this mission, they'll be back.

01:17.050 --> 01:18.178
We won't last a week.

01:18.211 --> 01:19.246
Gotta go.

01:19.279 --> 01:21.715
The most important thing
is you coming back to me.

01:22.950 --> 01:25.352
- You the guy?
- I'm the guy.

01:25.385 --> 01:27.287
Let's go.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.489
Whose guy is this?

01:29.523 --> 01:32.659
Boss wants him in the
crew, so he's in the crew.

01:52.579 --> 01:54.514
Okay, we got the new guy with us,

01:54.548 --> 01:56.883
but we stick to the plan. Understood?

01:57.584 --> 01:59.486
We get in, we get the pills, we leave.

01:59.519 --> 02:01.788
Whole thing should take no
more than five minutes tops.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.557
Now, Mama Vernon's in there.

02:03.590 --> 02:06.026
We all know she loves to roll
with the security detail,

02:06.059 --> 02:08.299
so please, for the love of all
that is sweet and merciful

02:08.328 --> 02:10.396
in this world, stay the
hell away from her.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.399
Charlie, you take care of
the guards at the front.

02:12.432 --> 02:14.368
Jack 'em up, but try to
leave them breathing.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.036
Anyone opens fire on me,

02:16.069 --> 02:17.389
you best believe I'm firing back.

02:17.413 --> 02:19.373
No, Charlie. No.

02:19.406 --> 02:22.909
This is a heist. Not
a shootout, a heist.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.144
Put on your masks. We get in,

02:24.177 --> 02:26.213
we grab the merchandise,
we get the fuck out.

02:26.246 --> 02:27.914
Are we clear?

02:27.948 --> 02:29.516
Put on your fucking masks.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.121
Where the hell's he going?

02:36.145 --> 02:38.058
Hey! Shit.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.626
Fucking GI Joe.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.769
Hey, Rambo, where the
hell are you going, man?

02:48.802 --> 02:50.737
The front entrance would've led you into

02:50.771 --> 02:52.606
a choke point on the factory floor.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.359
We'll make entry using
the ventilator shafts

02:54.383 --> 02:55.742
on this side.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.277
What ventilator shaft?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.119
This one.

03:07.454 --> 03:08.955
Who is this guy?

03:08.989 --> 03:10.824
You comin'?

03:15.262 --> 03:17.230
I told you to keep your damn mask on.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.800
You do not want these
people seeing your face.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.435
- Trust me.
- They won't.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.173
We got him on the river. Unbelievable.

03:28.408 --> 03:30.911
Oh, man. They're gonna see us.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.079
Let's burn them down.

03:32.112 --> 03:33.280
Hold.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.449
It's all good over here.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.120
Bridges went by or not? I left early.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.655
Yeah, he did.

03:51.098 --> 03:55.168
Pills are gonna be up ahead
on the main factory floor.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.138
God damn.

04:31.171 --> 04:33.251
A lot more guards than I
thought there were gonna be.

04:33.275 --> 04:36.076
Okay, uh, let me think, let me think.

04:54.661 --> 04:55.829
Fuck!

05:00.300 --> 05:01.668
- Look out!
- Behind you!

05:04.905 --> 05:08.708
- Forward, forward!
- No, up top, up top!

05:08.742 --> 05:10.811
Stay close, everyone!

05:10.844 --> 05:13.413
Stay close!

05:20.754 --> 05:22.756
- Move, move!
- Spencer, move back!

05:22.789 --> 05:23.957
Ugghhh!

05:25.091 --> 05:27.260
- Fall back!
- Aah!

05:28.695 --> 05:31.431
Over this way! Grab it... Let's go!

05:40.941 --> 05:42.609
Now moving to the exit!

05:49.482 --> 05:51.918
Put your guns down!

06:38.865 --> 06:41.534
- Aah!
- Stay on the ground!

06:45.772 --> 06:47.240
Where the hell's he going?

06:47.274 --> 06:49.042
Drop the weapon! Get down!

06:49.075 --> 06:50.710
Down on the ground, now!

06:52.612 --> 06:54.347
We're on our way.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.453
Bag it up, boys. Bag it!

07:09.796 --> 07:11.798
Doug?

07:18.371 --> 07:22.008
You didn't see me, you don't know me.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.577
Get out of here... now!

07:33.420 --> 07:35.055
Uhh!

07:42.395 --> 07:44.998
Those motherfuckers actually
sent someone here to kill me?

07:45.031 --> 07:46.311
Why does the CIA want you dead?

07:46.335 --> 07:47.834
The CIA?

07:47.867 --> 07:49.269
Why do they want me to kill you?

07:49.302 --> 07:51.438
They don't even know I exist.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.209
I can pay you.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.979
Enough to make you walk
away from this right now.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.564
Got it!

08:17.597 --> 08:19.933
Hey, where's Charlie?

08:19.966 --> 08:21.935
He didn't make it.

09:10.984 --> 09:15.221
♪ Whenever we're not together ♪

09:15.255 --> 09:19.559
♪ In days of sunshine
or stormy weather ♪

09:29.302 --> 09:30.637
You know me?

12:52.972 --> 12:55.475
When I heard there was
a funeral going on,

12:55.508 --> 12:57.744
I knew I'd find you dancing.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.779
This is a long way from Damascus.

12:59.812 --> 13:03.216
My editor was killed by an
IED a week after you left.

13:03.249 --> 13:06.452
I took that as a sign
I should get out, too.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.621
How many women can say
they struck up a friendship

13:08.655 --> 13:09.989
in a war zone?

13:10.023 --> 13:12.091
It's been too long

13:12.125 --> 13:14.093
since I worked a big story.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.762
How long?

13:15.795 --> 13:16.963
Crypt 4.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.965
Remember the story we wrote together?

13:18.998 --> 13:20.767
Remember Nolan Lavelle?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.435
Of course.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.271
Paranoid, attention-seeking, brilliant.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.674
Releasing the biggest
batch of classified files

13:27.707 --> 13:29.309
since Cablegate.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.278
I need to see Sebastian.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.646
Sebastian?

13:34.747 --> 13:37.083
He's in prison.

13:37.116 --> 13:38.985
What happened?

13:39.018 --> 13:41.788
Sebastian got caught moving
a shipment of assault rifles

13:41.821 --> 13:43.623
into Burkina Faso.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.896
He told me he was getting
out of that line of business.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.160
He'd have said anything

13:47.193 --> 13:49.162
if it meant keeping you around, Tara.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.902
Have you ever heard of Treadstone?

13:55.968 --> 13:57.470
No...

13:57.503 --> 13:59.339
Where is this coming from?

13:59.372 --> 14:01.741
I think it could be
connected to Stiletto Six.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.579
I chased stories because I wanted to.

14:06.612 --> 14:09.315
You chased them because you had to.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.451
That's the difference
between you and me.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.587
I admired you for it.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.023
Sebastian has contacts that I need.

14:17.056 --> 14:20.059
Can you get me inside that
prison to see him today?

14:20.093 --> 14:23.129
My cousin Kofi is a guard in there.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.964
I can try.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.014
- You must be Kofi.
- Yes.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.182
Thanks for getting me inside so quickly.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.952
Whatever you need, Tara. Follow me.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.904
You look good.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.472
You're in prison.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.508
Every woman looks good to you right now.

19:40.946 --> 19:43.182
What are you doing here?

19:43.215 --> 19:45.284
I could ask you the same question.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.486
I'm paying the price for some...

19:47.520 --> 19:50.723
spectacularly bad business decisions.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.858
What's your excuse?

19:52.892 --> 19:55.961
I wanted to talk to you.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.230
Well, I got a busy schedule, but...

19:58.264 --> 20:00.633
I'm sure we can squeeze you in.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.637
Are you okay, Sebastian?

20:04.670 --> 20:07.540
Yeah... yeah.

20:07.573 --> 20:10.176
Now come on, let me
take you on the tour.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.919
Well, welcome to my palace.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.420
I love it.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.014
I like what you've done with the place.

20:23.038 --> 20:24.706
Yeah, nice décor.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.828
Friends of yours?

20:28.861 --> 20:31.363
Oh, I see you're still
concerned about my wellbeing.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.032
I like it.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.945
I just wanna know if I'm
gonna get out of this

20:34.978 --> 20:36.680
place without getting
shanked, Sebastian.

20:36.713 --> 20:39.472
Well, then I suggest walking faster.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.875
So you just happen to be
passing through Ghana?

20:42.908 --> 20:44.443
Not exactly.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.645
What, you came here to see me?

20:46.679 --> 20:48.647
Actually, yes.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.382
I wanna show you something.

20:54.653 --> 20:56.322
Remember this?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.660
Syria, three years ago.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.462
Yeah.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.530
You kept it.

21:04.563 --> 21:07.166
Yeah, well, it's the
only thing I managed

21:07.199 --> 21:09.034
to smuggle inside here
when I got arrested.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.137
How romantic.

21:11.170 --> 21:14.206
Most guys would've just brought a photo.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.309
Five centimeters to the left,
it would've went through

21:17.343 --> 21:19.211
that side window and killed us both.

21:20.479 --> 21:22.548
- We got lucky.
- Did we?

21:22.581 --> 21:24.583
We're both standing here, right?

21:24.617 --> 21:28.120
Yeah, but... we're not together, though.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.356
Look, I know I'm not enough,

21:30.389 --> 21:32.291
right, to make you
abandon the chase, but...

21:32.324 --> 21:33.826
a family could be.

21:33.859 --> 21:35.661
I didn't come here to talk about us.

21:35.694 --> 21:38.063
Then what is this about, then?

21:41.133 --> 21:42.835
You need something.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.303
I'm your friend, Sebastian.

21:44.336 --> 21:47.439
You don't have friends.
You've got a collection

21:47.473 --> 21:49.508
of people who are ends to your means.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.577
I'm chasing a story.

21:53.212 --> 21:54.947
You're always chasing a story, Tara.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.816
It's the story.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.418
It's Stiletto Six.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.490
We're done.

22:18.838 --> 22:22.007
You're back?

22:22.041 --> 22:23.676
You weren't meant to come back.

22:23.709 --> 22:26.779
I was here before? For how long?

22:28.714 --> 22:30.149
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.851
Please.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.821
You were here... four months, maybe.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.990
Months?

22:38.023 --> 22:40.125
Are you sure it was me?

22:46.098 --> 22:48.968
You want the same room?

22:49.001 --> 22:51.670
It's exactly as you left it.

24:58.464 --> 25:02.668
- Don't do this.
- Oh, please... Matheson.

25:03.969 --> 25:05.604
Tell me.

25:05.637 --> 25:08.140
Bentley, it's me, Matheson.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.142
- I'm American...
- Where are the others?

25:10.175 --> 25:12.745
We trained together. We're friends.

25:12.778 --> 25:14.480
We're on the same side!

25:20.052 --> 25:22.488
What the hell did they do to you?

25:27.026 --> 25:29.595
Ellender...

25:29.628 --> 25:32.898
Jenkins, Newman...

25:36.368 --> 25:38.137
Good.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.638
No, no...

25:39.671 --> 25:41.607
Enough. Enough!

25:41.640 --> 25:43.175
He still needs to give us

25:43.208 --> 25:44.977
their locations so we can roll them up.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.445
He will.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.824
You should not be up here.

26:00.826 --> 26:03.495
You knew about this?

26:03.529 --> 26:06.799
- Hmm?
- Officially, I know nothing.

26:06.832 --> 26:08.200
You're working for the KGB.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.968
No! I don't know how they did it,

26:10.002 --> 26:11.470
but they programmed me somehow.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.172
I don't have any memory of this.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.445
I wasn't part of this. The
Russians just paid me off.

26:15.469 --> 26:16.975
They didn't tell me anything.

26:17.009 --> 26:20.179
But you were here, hmm?
You saw some things?

26:20.212 --> 26:22.147
Yes.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.820
The Russians brought in the
men who lived in this room.

26:27.853 --> 26:30.823
And I was one of them?

26:30.856 --> 26:33.625
I recognized some of the
people you took up here

26:33.659 --> 26:36.495
against their will. They were criminals,

26:36.528 --> 26:39.832
gangsters, men who
wouldn't break easily.

26:39.865 --> 26:42.601
Sometimes they left in body bags.

26:44.870 --> 26:48.006
I saw myself in that footage.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.577
It looked like I was enjoying myself.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.580
You were.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.349
How the fuck would you know that?

26:57.382 --> 27:00.419
Because you told me so yourself, John.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.856
You started talking to me
while you were a guest here.

27:03.889 --> 27:08.360
You said that you'd finally
found your true purpose.

27:13.565 --> 27:14.833
I'm not interested.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.168
I didn't come here to hurt you.

27:16.201 --> 27:17.803
Then why the hell did you come?

27:17.836 --> 27:19.638
I haven't slept in two days.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.306
I have been chased, I saw a kid get shot

27:21.340 --> 27:23.220
in the backseat of my car,
and I have never felt

27:23.244 --> 27:25.410
more alone than I do right now.

27:25.444 --> 27:26.879
I think you like being alone.

27:26.912 --> 27:29.548
It's fucked up, but
that is how I like it...

27:29.581 --> 27:31.049
It's how I've always liked it.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.351
Are you listening to yourself?

27:32.384 --> 27:34.264
The last thing I'd ever
want to do is to bring

27:34.288 --> 27:37.189
more pain into your life,
but I need your help.

27:37.222 --> 27:39.124
Yuri Leniov is selling

27:39.158 --> 27:41.118
the Stiletto Six launch
codes on the black market.

27:41.142 --> 27:42.161
Jesus.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.462
I need you to call him for me.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.898
- That's insane.
- Please, Sebastian.

27:45.931 --> 27:48.171
Not a chance... and even if
I wanted to do it, I couldn't

27:48.304 --> 27:49.864
because inmates can't make phone calls.

27:49.865 --> 27:50.825
I know.

27:50.826 --> 27:52.266
So as long as I'm locked up in here,

27:52.290 --> 27:53.372
nothing's happening.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.325
What if there was a way
to get you out of here?

27:55.349 --> 27:57.176
So you can get involved
with Yuri Leniov?

27:57.209 --> 27:58.277
No thanks.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.912
You know what's at stake.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.750
It was great seeing you again, Tara.

28:04.783 --> 28:07.286
Maybe I can be a bit
more useful the next time

28:07.319 --> 28:09.788
you travel across the
world to track me down.

28:15.827 --> 28:18.230
Everything okay?

28:19.164 --> 28:20.899
Kofi...

28:22.768 --> 28:24.970
I need your help with something.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.329
Bentley residence.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.399
Hello?

28:56.602 --> 29:00.205
Hello?

29:25.697 --> 29:29.167
- Sorry.
- You're American.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.769
Yeah, that's one of the few things

29:30.802 --> 29:32.704
I can say about myself for certain.

29:32.738 --> 29:36.208
Certainties are the only
things that interest me.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.911
Then this may be a short conversation.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.813
What's your name?

29:42.781 --> 29:44.116
John.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.653
What's your name?

29:48.887 --> 29:50.555
Katya.

29:54.159 --> 29:56.295
I crave certainty.

29:56.328 --> 29:59.231
I think it might be driving me insane.

29:59.264 --> 30:02.501
Then stop looking in the past.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.738
You were in Vietnam.

30:08.073 --> 30:09.574
How do you know that?

30:10.976 --> 30:12.711
I've guided veterans before.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.746
Men carrying scars of deep trauma.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.118
You keep it all bottled up inside.

30:20.152 --> 30:23.488
And what exactly am I
supposed to do with it?

30:24.923 --> 30:26.525
Let it go.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.562
Letting go is hard.

30:33.298 --> 30:36.401
You're looking for an answer.

30:38.136 --> 30:41.606
And those that pass it can help.

31:34.726 --> 31:35.827
Hey.

34:20.692 --> 34:24.161
It's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry.

34:24.195 --> 34:25.864
You had someone stab me?

34:25.897 --> 34:28.266
Meghan's cousin assured me it
would be a minor flesh wound.

34:28.299 --> 34:29.634
It doesn't feel minor.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.402
Imagine what it was like before I
shot you up with the pain killers.

34:33.972 --> 34:35.532
The medic said you'd heal up in a week

34:35.556 --> 34:37.475
with no complications.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.811
I said no to you.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.681
I'm sorry, but it's a chance
to do the right thing.

34:42.714 --> 34:45.183
Next time you need my help,

34:45.216 --> 34:47.619
don't stab me in the back.

35:02.167 --> 35:04.469
You got a helicopter? Where'd
you get the money from?

35:04.502 --> 35:07.939
I took it from the funds I'm
gonna use to buy Stiletto Six.

35:07.973 --> 35:09.173
What funds?

35:09.207 --> 35:10.775
I'll tell you when we're airborne.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.944
- Meghan.
- Hello, Sebastian.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.446
Thanks for wrangling the chopper.

35:14.479 --> 35:15.947
Thanks for bringing me on board.

35:15.981 --> 35:17.048
Okay.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.985
Let's do this.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.045
Hey!

36:39.197 --> 36:42.100
What happened?

36:49.174 --> 36:50.975
Hey.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.951
Did you kill her?

37:02.253 --> 37:04.155
Yeah.

37:08.259 --> 37:10.462
It's like I was someone else.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.668
When I stopped resisting it...

37:16.701 --> 37:21.206
something just took over.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.008
What did you people do to me?

37:24.042 --> 37:26.111
- We...
- Turned me into a...

37:26.144 --> 37:28.780
turned me into a monster.

37:30.381 --> 37:32.417
You're not a monster.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.652
You're a really good man and I love you.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.188
All these years I thought
you were just some...

37:37.222 --> 37:40.158
you were some big city
girl from up north.

37:42.627 --> 37:45.730
You're not really from Boston, are you?

37:51.803 --> 37:54.038
No...

37:54.072 --> 37:56.741
No, I'm not.

37:58.376 --> 38:00.245
But you are.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.852
Doug...

38:09.954 --> 38:12.557
Mike was at that pill factory.

38:13.658 --> 38:15.860
- Wait, what?
- He saw me.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.030
I don't know who else is involved,

38:19.063 --> 38:20.632
but I gotta warn him

38:20.665 --> 38:22.700
in case someone comes
around asking questions.

38:24.335 --> 38:26.237
Baby...

38:28.673 --> 38:30.909
What's happening? Are we okay?

38:32.811 --> 38:35.113
I don't know, Sam.

38:39.350 --> 38:41.586
Oh, my God.

39:18.389 --> 39:21.025
What is this place?

39:21.059 --> 39:24.062
Somewhere past and future don't exist.

39:25.663 --> 39:28.867
What you become will control you...

39:28.900 --> 39:30.969
unless you learn how to accept it.

39:31.002 --> 39:33.872
What if I don't wanna accept it?

39:33.905 --> 39:36.341
Let your heart take over.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.010
Doesn't even make any sense.

39:40.745 --> 39:43.047
Real answers only come

39:43.081 --> 39:45.383
after you've left your mind far behind.

39:45.416 --> 39:47.285
And how do I do that?

39:49.821 --> 39:51.656
You trust me.

40:05.203 --> 40:07.906
Are you ready?

40:07.939 --> 40:09.741
Tell me how this works.

40:09.774 --> 40:12.777
I'll guide you.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.581
Just stay close to me and
the sound of my voice.

40:16.614 --> 40:18.650
How do I do that?

40:19.717 --> 40:21.419
That's the easy part.

40:21.452 --> 40:23.554
Just a tab.

41:15.740 --> 41:17.875
Give me the envelope.

41:33.624 --> 41:35.660
Those belong to my husband!

41:35.693 --> 41:37.395
Stand down.
