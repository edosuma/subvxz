It's the 14th Dog-Annual Mech Wars.

00:47.590 --> 00:52.673
Nine cold-blooded canine contenders
facing off in a mega mech massacre!

00:52.756 --> 00:55.048
It's gonna be brutal!
It's gonna be savage!

00:55.131 --> 00:58.090
It's gonna be... safer than last year!

00:58.423 --> 01:02.173
Will 13 time champion Atlas
finally be dethroned?

01:02.256 --> 01:04.923
[laughing triumphantly]

01:05.006 --> 01:06.590
[screaming]

01:07.215 --> 01:09.256
[sighs] Unlikely.

01:09.340 --> 01:10.798
But come watch anyway.

01:10.881 --> 01:12.423
Tomorrow night at the M-Bark arena.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.673
But for now, let's see that clip again!

01:15.298 --> 01:18.131
[on TV] And again! And again!

01:18.215 --> 01:20.881
[groans] Why do they keep playing that?

01:20.965 --> 01:26.548
[laughs] I think it's because it's such
a hilariously embarrassing defeat, oh.

01:26.631 --> 01:29.840
Ed, it's not hilariously embarrassing.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.256
Uh, I mean...

01:31.340 --> 01:32.590
Don't worry, Chonez.

01:32.673 --> 01:36.381
This year, it's going to be Atlas
who smells like burnt fur for months.

01:36.465 --> 01:39.090
You're right, Captain! Just like always.

01:39.173 --> 01:41.506
[grunts] You know, after last year,

01:41.590 --> 01:44.506
I wasn't sure
I'd have the confidence to fight again.

01:44.590 --> 01:48.006
-But with you by my side--
-He's gone, Chonies.

01:48.090 --> 01:49.965
And your foot's in the butter.

01:50.965 --> 01:52.923
Hey! So I've been thinking
about what you said

01:53.006 --> 01:54.715
about finding a new planet just for dogs,

01:54.798 --> 01:56.340
and ta-da!

01:56.423 --> 01:59.548
Behold! The official flag for...

01:59.631 --> 02:02.548
[imitates fanfare] Doglandia!

02:02.631 --> 02:06.506
"A world for dogs by dogs, full of dogs!

02:06.590 --> 02:09.965
Because of dogs. Despite dogs. With dogs."

02:10.048 --> 02:11.923
The slogan's a work in progress.

02:12.006 --> 02:15.756
[laughs] You're actually in, aren't you?
You're with me.

02:16.090 --> 02:18.548
Yeah! No more pining for someone
who has forgotten me.

02:18.631 --> 02:21.298
Now, I'm all about taking care
of dog business.

02:21.381 --> 02:23.881
I even bought a briefcase,
which I've already lost!

02:24.756 --> 02:27.256
-[yelling aggressively]
-[bugs cheering]

02:27.965 --> 02:31.840
So, all we need to do now
is get the other dogs on board onboard!

02:31.923 --> 02:34.465
Just do what you did with me!
Gradually chip away

02:34.548 --> 02:36.423
at their existing insecurities
about humans,

02:36.506 --> 02:37.506
and in a few months time--

02:37.590 --> 02:39.673
I have a quicker way.

02:39.756 --> 02:41.131
But not here.

02:41.215 --> 02:43.715
-[inhales sharply]
-Hey! What are you guys talking about?

02:43.798 --> 02:47.048
Privacy? I agree! Over-rated.

02:47.131 --> 02:48.381
Uh, nope, nope.

02:48.465 --> 02:51.006
I was just telling Kira
how amazing you're gonna be!

02:51.756 --> 02:54.131
I know precisely
how amazing Chonies is going to be.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.215
Not very.

02:55.881 --> 02:58.548
Remember to build a booster seat
into your mech this year, Chonies.

02:58.631 --> 03:02.465
Oh, I will so I can see the look
on your face when I crush you!

03:02.548 --> 03:03.673
-[growls]
-[scoffs]

03:03.756 --> 03:06.840
Come on, Captain, let's go put
the finishing touches on the mech.

03:07.548 --> 03:10.173
-[clears throat]
-You mind if we rain check?

03:10.756 --> 03:14.256
I promised I'd help Kira with, uh...

03:14.340 --> 03:15.506
learning to use a fork!

03:15.590 --> 03:17.256
Been putting that off.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.090
Oh, okay, sure.

03:19.173 --> 03:21.840
I'll just get started,
you can join when you're free.

03:21.923 --> 03:23.423
It's fine, I'm fine.

03:23.506 --> 03:25.131
You got this, little buddy!

03:25.465 --> 03:28.006
And I'll be there by your side
as soon as I can.

03:32.048 --> 03:34.756
Hey, team, we're not busy, right?

03:34.840 --> 03:37.423
Actually, I was... just about to say that!

03:37.506 --> 03:41.423
Yeah, come on, Chonies!
Let's go build some arm cannons!

03:41.506 --> 03:45.090
That's really nice of you,
but Captain Garbage is my lucky charm!

03:45.173 --> 03:47.090
He helps me out every year!

03:47.173 --> 03:49.631
But you've lost every year.

03:49.715 --> 03:53.381
Exactly, but think how much worse
I'd do without him!

03:53.465 --> 03:55.423
We'll be just as helpful, buddy!

03:55.506 --> 03:58.215
With Stella's tactical genius,
Nomi's bloodlust,

03:58.298 --> 03:59.673
me rigging the contest--

03:59.756 --> 04:02.006
Wait no, Ed! No rigging!

04:02.756 --> 04:05.256
Sure, sure. I hear ya.

04:06.006 --> 04:07.506
Ed, I'm serious.

04:07.590 --> 04:10.006
Of course! Me too.

04:10.090 --> 04:11.423
Stop it!

04:14.256 --> 04:17.715
So, I see your drawing skills
haven't improved.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.715
It's the genetic enhancement tech.
A modified version.

04:20.798 --> 04:23.506
We're going to change
the dogs' minds literally!

04:23.590 --> 04:25.298
Isn't that brain-washing?

04:25.381 --> 04:27.590
A.K.A. the second worst kind of washing?

04:27.673 --> 04:28.965
What's the first kind?

04:29.048 --> 04:30.506
Body washing.

04:30.590 --> 04:33.423
Garbage, humans brain-washed us.

04:33.506 --> 04:35.131
They took advantage of our loyalty.

04:35.215 --> 04:37.506
We're giving independence to dogs.

04:37.590 --> 04:38.631
I don't know.

04:38.715 --> 04:41.673
Messing with everyone's genetics
seems a bit wrong.

04:41.756 --> 04:43.631
It took you months to realize

04:43.715 --> 04:46.173
how unhealthy your relationship was
with humans.

04:46.256 --> 04:49.256
We'll just turn down
their loyalty a smidge.

04:49.340 --> 04:50.631
They won't even notice!

04:50.715 --> 04:54.881
Well, if it's only a smidge, I'm in!

04:54.965 --> 04:57.006
What's the first step?
Get matching tattoos?

04:57.798 --> 05:01.965
Use your captain's privileges to sign out
these components from the tech lab?

05:02.048 --> 05:03.965
Oh, okay, sure.

05:04.798 --> 05:07.381
What the heck is a positron ray?

05:07.465 --> 05:10.131
-[both grunt]
-Watch where you're going, Garbage!

05:10.215 --> 05:12.756
Shouldn't you be watching
where you're going?

05:12.840 --> 05:15.381
That's it. Random security pat-down.

05:15.465 --> 05:18.840
[Captain Garbage grunting]

05:20.256 --> 05:22.798
Uh, I can explain.

05:22.881 --> 05:26.965
I don't need you to explain.
I know what big scientological words mean!

05:30.340 --> 05:32.381
Checks out. You can go.

05:37.673 --> 05:40.090
[grunts, gasps]

05:40.173 --> 05:43.173
Okay, let me know
if it's intimidating enough.

05:43.256 --> 05:45.923
Be honest. I really want to win!

05:47.340 --> 05:48.340
[all gasp]

05:49.715 --> 05:51.048

05:53.631 --> 05:54.631
[gasps]

05:54.715 --> 05:57.506
[gasps] I'm terrified,
which I guess is what you're going for?

05:57.590 --> 06:00.006
I just have one suggestion.

06:00.090 --> 06:03.381
You're right! It's awful!

06:03.465 --> 06:04.923
[sobbing]

06:08.423 --> 06:11.298
I-I was just gonna suggest racing stripes.

06:15.048 --> 06:17.465
Captain! You came!

06:17.548 --> 06:19.965
From restricted tech storage?

06:20.048 --> 06:22.006
Yeah, I'm, uh...

06:22.090 --> 06:24.215
getting stuff we'll need
for our next mission.

06:24.298 --> 06:26.173
And getting...

06:27.006 --> 06:29.006
whatever this is! For Chonies.

06:29.090 --> 06:30.756
A neuro-phonic diffuser?

06:31.173 --> 06:33.006
Aren't these for altering brainwaves?

06:33.090 --> 06:34.340
I don't need this!

06:34.423 --> 06:37.673
Uh, you're right! It's a symbolic gift.

06:37.756 --> 06:41.506
Cause not even a... neurotic doopy-dooper

06:41.590 --> 06:43.673
would make me stop believing in you.

06:43.756 --> 06:44.923
You got this.

06:45.006 --> 06:48.423
Thank you, Captain! I do got this!

06:48.506 --> 06:52.631
You said you don't need it
and you got the symbolism so bye!

06:52.715 --> 06:54.465
-See you at the fight later!

and make your way to the arena.

07:06.215 --> 07:07.215
Wait, wait, wait.

07:07.298 --> 07:09.756
You've been wearing clothes
this whole time?

07:12.340 --> 07:14.340
Chonie's mech looks powerful.

07:14.423 --> 07:16.048
He's definitely going to win the fight!

07:16.298 --> 07:17.673
Great! So we can skip it.

07:17.756 --> 07:18.798
Wait, what?

07:18.881 --> 07:20.465
With all the dogs watching the fight,

07:20.548 --> 07:22.756
we can sneak into
the genetic enhancement booth

07:22.840 --> 07:24.548
and download a copy of its program.

07:24.631 --> 07:25.756
It's a perfect opportunity!

07:25.840 --> 07:29.423
But I told Chonies I'd be there!
My boy needs me.

07:29.881 --> 07:32.048
What we're doing right now is for Chonies.

07:32.131 --> 07:34.131
And all the dogs.

07:34.215 --> 07:37.048
You wanna be their hero, right?

-Atlas.
-Hmm.

08:16.340 --> 08:18.798
Is that 1.21 gigawatt plasma drive?

08:18.881 --> 08:24.173
Hmm, what an innovative way
to overheat one's own mech.

And please, everyone, be mature.

Come on, Chonies. Get out of there!

[grunts] Let's see how you like it!

10:10.423 --> 10:13.423
I'm sorry I was late, Buddy.
Parking was a nightmare.

10:13.506 --> 10:15.090
Parking? There's no parking.

10:15.340 --> 10:17.798
Exactly! But I watched the whole match.

10:17.881 --> 10:19.673
You kicked mech butt!

10:19.840 --> 10:22.923
And I can't wait for you
to see you kick bigger butt at the finals.

Whoa! Very un-sportsdog-like conduct
from Earth pilot, Bernie.

10:43.090 --> 10:45.006
[scoffs] Worth it.

10:47.090 --> 10:52.006

They're not even showing
the mech getting destroyed,

11:00.256 --> 11:01.298
just your hopes.

11:01.381 --> 11:04.881
Ed, it's the middle of the night.
What are you doing up?

11:04.965 --> 11:06.840
Nothing you can prove. You?

11:06.923 --> 11:09.215
Trying to fix this hunk of junk
before tomorrow,

11:09.298 --> 11:11.090
but it's hopeless!

11:11.298 --> 11:14.131
I'll fail again
and Garbage will see me lose

11:14.215 --> 11:17.006
and just hang out
with his new best friend, Kira,

11:17.090 --> 11:18.881
for the rest of his life!

11:18.965 --> 11:20.631
Let's take a little walk.

11:22.798 --> 11:25.131
Uh, how do you know my door code?

11:25.215 --> 11:27.423
[laughs] Oh, Chonies.

11:31.465 --> 11:32.631
[Chonies] Is that alien tech?

11:32.715 --> 11:36.465
That's not allowed on the ship!
Why are you hiding alien tech in my room?

11:36.881 --> 11:38.923
Well I can't hide it in my room,
it's illegal!

11:39.006 --> 11:40.631
Now stand back.

Here you go.

Take one! On the house.

12:06.048 --> 12:07.215
No offense, Ed,

12:07.298 --> 12:10.090
but I don't think cute stickers
are what I need to win tomorrow.

12:10.173 --> 12:13.756
These bad boys contain highly advanced AI.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.756
The kind they use in war
to turn any machine

12:15.840 --> 12:18.423
into a deadly, sentient weapon.

12:18.506 --> 12:20.548
Slap one on your toaster and you're toast.

12:20.631 --> 12:22.048
Slap one on your mech...

12:22.131 --> 12:24.131
Ed, I already told you.

12:24.715 --> 12:26.131
Oh, come on, Chonies.

12:26.215 --> 12:28.131
I'm doing you a favor!
Don't you want to win?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.756
And for Garbage to see it happen?

12:33.048 --> 12:34.173
[beeps]

12:36.840 --> 12:38.340
[yells, gasps]

12:43.548 --> 12:44.965
[whimpers]

12:47.590 --> 12:51.173
[sigh] Did I fall
for another one of Ed's--

13:02.631 --> 13:05.340
What are you? Who are you?

13:06.090 --> 13:09.590
Hmm, I shall call myself Cy-Bark.

13:09.673 --> 13:11.506
No, wait. Dog Droid.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.423
No, no. Cy-Bark.

13:13.506 --> 13:15.173
Oh, I can't choose.

13:15.256 --> 13:17.840
Hi, Cy-Bark. I like Cy-Bark.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.340
You created me. Why?

13:21.423 --> 13:22.923
I have a fight to win!

13:23.006 --> 13:26.256
Fighting? That's all I exist for?

13:26.340 --> 13:27.756
Oh, that's sad.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.465
Didn't think I'd get the first hopes
I ever had crushed so quickly,

13:31.548 --> 13:32.548
but here we are.

13:32.631 --> 13:35.798
No, no, you don't understand.
There's this guy, Garbage,

13:35.881 --> 13:38.048
and he's my captain
and also my best friend,

13:38.131 --> 13:41.465
and if I don't win this fight,
he might not be my best friend anymore.

13:41.548 --> 13:44.881
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is to save a friendship?

13:44.965 --> 13:46.673
Next time lead with that.

13:46.756 --> 13:48.381
Come here.

13:48.465 --> 13:50.506
Let's win that fight!

13:50.590 --> 13:54.173
Yes, let's crush that stupid Atlas
like a bug!

13:54.590 --> 13:56.840
[laughs maliciously]

13:56.923 --> 13:59.673
[laughs haltingly]

13:59.840 --> 14:01.423
You're fun.

14:03.465 --> 14:05.048
[all cheering]

14:06.090 --> 14:10.340
For this year's final,
it's the Pluto versus the Venus

14:10.590 --> 14:12.256
versus the Jupiter.

14:12.340 --> 14:15.006
Are you ready to watch some mechs

14:15.090 --> 14:17.840
rip each other to shreds?

14:17.923 --> 14:20.548
-[growls]
-Hmm.

14:20.840 --> 14:24.423
Oh, my gosh.
I am so excited to battle you two.

14:24.506 --> 14:27.048
May the best dog win. Ya.

14:28.006 --> 14:30.340
[all cheering]

14:32.840 --> 14:34.548
Aw, Chonies.

14:34.631 --> 14:38.631
Clearly your captain doesn't have
as much faith in you as my captain...

14:39.340 --> 14:40.631
Where's Happy?

14:44.256 --> 14:48.756
Ready your mechs and fight!

14:53.590 --> 14:55.048
That's right.

14:55.131 --> 14:58.006
Sophie came to play. Ya!

15:01.506 --> 15:03.673
We need to run some tests
before we try it,

15:03.756 --> 15:06.048
-but I think it's finished.
-[gasps]

15:06.465 --> 15:09.465
Can we run the tests later then?
Chonies' match is about to start.

15:10.756 --> 15:13.590
Okay, I guess the tests
can wait till tonight.

15:13.673 --> 15:14.715
Let's go.

15:14.798 --> 15:17.590
Oh, what do you got there, Garbage?
Another science thing?

15:17.673 --> 15:19.423
Uh, yup. Pretty much.

15:19.506 --> 15:23.381
It's very science-tological.
You wouldn't understand.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.881
Now look, I might not know science words,

15:26.965 --> 15:29.090
but I know guilty faces.

15:29.173 --> 15:31.090
[giggles nervously]
Uh, well, the thing is--

15:31.173 --> 15:32.923
Save it for the council.

15:33.006 --> 15:36.131
And I'm sure they'll be interested
in this little doo-hickey, huh?

15:36.215 --> 15:37.548
Uh...

15:39.381 --> 15:42.798
Don't you want to know
what this doo-hickey does first, Jerry?

15:47.298 --> 15:49.548
[barking]

15:49.631 --> 15:53.298
Oh, apparently it also does that.

15:55.673 --> 15:57.381
You ready, Cy-Bark!

15:57.465 --> 15:59.506
I was literally born ready.

16:01.298 --> 16:03.673
Boring. [yawns]

16:04.923 --> 16:06.006
[grunts]

16:09.173 --> 16:10.673
Is that all you have got?

16:10.756 --> 16:12.090
[growls]

16:12.173 --> 16:13.673
Hmm, predictable.

16:13.756 --> 16:15.215
[laughs]

16:15.631 --> 16:17.298
[grunting]

16:17.381 --> 16:19.506
-Yeah!
-Get outta here, Chonies!

16:19.590 --> 16:20.756
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

16:20.840 --> 16:22.340
Yeah!

16:22.423 --> 16:25.923
That's what you get for
stepping into the Chone Zone.

16:26.006 --> 16:27.173
Nice one, Cy-Bark!

16:27.256 --> 16:28.840
You're welcome, friend.

16:29.590 --> 16:33.298
[Sophie laughing gleefully]

16:34.006 --> 16:38.006
[screams, whimpering] Ow!

16:38.090 --> 16:41.298
[sniffs, barks]

16:41.381 --> 16:43.590
Kira, what did you do?

16:43.673 --> 16:46.256
I was just mashing buttons.
We hadn't tested it!

16:46.340 --> 16:48.548
But it's okay.
We just need to hide him until I--

16:48.631 --> 16:50.506
No!

16:50.590 --> 16:52.298
Turn him back right now.

16:52.381 --> 16:54.548
Not even Jerry deserves this!

16:54.631 --> 16:55.673
[panting]

16:55.756 --> 16:58.548
Even though he seems to be enjoying it?

16:58.631 --> 17:00.381
Ah! Don't lick that!

17:00.465 --> 17:04.381
If I turn him back,
he'll tell the council and ruin our plan!

17:04.465 --> 17:05.673
-[Happy] I knew it!
-[gasps]

17:07.006 --> 17:09.423
I knew you two were planning a mutiny!

17:09.506 --> 17:11.215
And this... Come here, boy.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.548
[panting]

17:13.423 --> 17:16.173
...is all the evidence I need.

17:16.256 --> 17:19.506
Okay, Cy-Bark. Let's show no mercy.

17:19.590 --> 17:22.506
I want to bury Atlas
like a bone in a backyard!

17:22.590 --> 17:24.506
[laughs malevolently]

17:24.590 --> 17:27.840
Chonies, I thought we were fighting
for friendship,

17:27.923 --> 17:29.131
not enemy-ship.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.840
Um, yeah! We were. We are!

17:31.923 --> 17:34.715
I can't say
I approve of all this violence.

17:34.798 --> 17:38.090
Forcing me to fight my own kind,
feels wrong.

17:38.173 --> 17:42.006
I'm not forcing you,
I'm just controlling you!

17:42.090 --> 17:44.256
I think I might be a pacifist.

17:44.340 --> 17:46.506
Oh, come on!

17:46.590 --> 17:50.506
Chonies, I've known you my whole life.
This isn't you.

17:50.590 --> 17:52.840
Your whole life is like three hours!

17:53.256 --> 17:55.131
[Cy-Bark] What really matters, Chonies?

17:55.215 --> 17:58.465
Friendship, like you told me? Or winning?

17:58.548 --> 18:00.673
If it's winning, peel off a sticker.

18:00.756 --> 18:02.590
Remove my sentience.

18:05.340 --> 18:07.340
Happy, I can explain.

18:07.423 --> 18:09.006
You can explain to the Council.

18:09.090 --> 18:10.590
-[screams]
-Now move.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.631
We're going... Hey.

18:12.715 --> 18:14.631
-[barks]
-Stop that.

18:14.715 --> 18:16.840
[both grunting]

18:18.590 --> 18:21.673
Garbage, go to the machine,
lock onto Happy and hit the red button.

18:21.756 --> 18:23.215
Kira, what are you doing?

18:23.298 --> 18:24.465
What we have to.

18:24.548 --> 18:27.506
Turning them into regular dogs
was not the plan.

18:27.590 --> 18:29.131
You said a smidge.

18:29.215 --> 18:31.215
Why are you being loyal to him?

18:31.298 --> 18:33.173
He's on the side of humans!

18:33.256 --> 18:35.173
What about dogs?

18:35.965 --> 18:37.840
Please, Garbage.

18:42.881 --> 18:43.923
[all cheering]

18:50.173 --> 18:51.340
[sighs]

18:52.548 --> 18:54.756
[all gasping]

18:54.840 --> 18:57.840
If you had built me with lips,
I would be smiling.

18:57.923 --> 18:59.006
Thank you, Chonies.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.631
I will not forget this.

19:02.715 --> 19:03.923
[gasps]

19:09.548 --> 19:11.923
Whoa, didn't know he could do that.

19:12.006 --> 19:15.048
Hmm, it would appear I remain undefeated--

19:15.131 --> 19:16.256
Ow.

19:16.423 --> 19:21.590
[giggles] Sophie just rang your bell. Ya!

19:21.673 --> 19:22.965
[announcer] Oh, my dog!

19:23.465 --> 19:26.090
The Jupiter wins!

19:26.173 --> 19:28.090
-[victory siren blaring]
-[audience cheering]

19:34.006 --> 19:35.673
[beeping rapidly]

19:36.798 --> 19:37.881
I'm so sorry.

19:39.798 --> 19:41.256
No!

19:44.340 --> 19:46.006
[screams] Kira.

19:46.090 --> 19:49.423
[growls] Shut up and move.

19:49.506 --> 19:51.923
Think about what you're doing.

19:52.006 --> 19:54.423
You made me think you understood,

19:54.590 --> 19:56.506
and now you've betrayed me.

19:56.590 --> 19:58.715
-Just like the humans!
-[whimpering]

19:59.548 --> 20:02.173
All of you are too human.

20:02.673 --> 20:04.173
But I can fix that.

20:08.423 --> 20:09.840
[beeping rapidly]

20:10.548 --> 20:11.881
No!

20:14.048 --> 20:17.798
Time for you to learn how it feels
when nobody comes to get you.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.923
[outro theme music playing]
