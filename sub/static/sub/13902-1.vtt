Fix & Resync By Ind14n L33CH3r

00:07.199 --> 00:09.085
I love London.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.162
I love its rudeness, its lack of
community, its impatience.

00:13.202 --> 00:15.163
I even love its weather.

00:17.884 --> 00:19.805
But most of all I love the
anonymity.

00:22.007 --> 00:25.169
The first thing you should know
about me is that I'm a whore.

00:29.331 --> 00:33.053
In the world of children in bikinis
and grandmothers in fuck-me boots,

00:33.088 --> 00:34.779
the surest way to tell a prostitute

00:34.814 --> 00:36.775
is to look for the woman
in the designer suit.

00:37.535 --> 00:40.337
Locate the lifts.
Glide past reception.

00:41.097 --> 00:43.224
Look like
you know where you're going.

00:43.258 --> 00:46.780
Don't attract too much attention.
Be fabulous but forgettable.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.902
You should also know
that this isn't the real me.

01:38.047 --> 01:40.009
Morning.

01:42.530 --> 01:44.616
Escort. Hooker. Prostitute. Whore.

01:44.651 --> 01:48.333
I don't mind what you call me,
that's just semantics.

01:56.017 --> 01:59.859
There are as many different kinds of
working girls as there are people.

02:00.659 --> 02:02.746
But I can tell you about me.

02:02.781 --> 02:05.742
I should say up front
that I wasn't abused by a relative.

02:06.503 --> 02:08.549
I've got no children to support

02:08.584 --> 02:10.824
and I've never been addicted
to anything.

02:12.226 --> 02:15.868
Except for maybe the fourth season
of The West Wing, but you know...

02:16.508 --> 02:18.515
I'm very high class

02:18.550 --> 02:20.591
which means I charge by the hour

02:20.625 --> 02:22.551
and I charge a lot.

02:24.472 --> 02:26.479
So why do I do it?

02:26.513 --> 02:28.474
Well, I love sex and I love money.

02:30.436 --> 02:33.277
And I know you don't believe
I enjoy the sex, but I do.

02:33.312 --> 02:35.238
But I'm fundamentally lazy.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.320
What I really like
is being my own boss.

02:38.355 --> 02:40.366
Well, pretty much my own boss.

02:40.401 --> 02:43.162
Obviously, I have an agent,
she vets all my clients.

02:43.883 --> 02:46.089
Two lovely new gentlemen
for you today.

02:46.124 --> 02:49.566
OK. 'An out-call this evening
and an in-call this afternoon. '

02:49.601 --> 02:51.487
When?
Two o'clock.

02:52.728 --> 02:54.734
It's half one now.
Is it?

02:54.769 --> 02:57.294
Yes. You know I need
at least an hour's notice.

02:57.330 --> 03:01.572
Well, shit, shower and shave,
sweetheart. He's on his way over.

03:23.984 --> 03:27.106
I have certain rules.
Rule 1- keep life and job separate.

03:27.141 --> 03:29.147
Personal. Work.

03:29.182 --> 03:31.108
Private.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.550
Professional.

03:35.671 --> 03:37.677
Hannah. Belle.

03:37.712 --> 03:39.672
And never the twain shall meet.

03:42.034 --> 03:43.639
Thank you.

03:43.675 --> 03:45.721
Rule No. 2- stay in control.

03:45.756 --> 03:48.198
They sit down, I stand up.
Get the money first.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.526
Yeah, I'll call after.

03:56.562 --> 03:58.523
No problem. All right, bye.

03:59.964 --> 04:02.610
Rule 3- safety.
Always check in with the agency.

04:02.645 --> 04:06.287
So if I say "no problemo" instead of
"no problem" there's a problem.

04:09.929 --> 04:11.890
Everything you need's in here.

04:15.411 --> 04:17.892
Rule 4- hygiene. Mine and his.

04:23.576 --> 04:25.617
I always use men's deodorant.

04:25.652 --> 04:27.578
I never wear perfume.

04:28.218 --> 04:31.580
A professional never lets her client
leave smelling of woman.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.585
Convince them that you're wet
and you're halfway there.

04:42.426 --> 04:44.432
Goes without saying.

04:44.467 --> 04:46.513
And last but definitely not least,

04:46.549 --> 04:49.990
work out what the client wants
as fast as you can.

04:50.025 --> 04:51.951
And give it to him.

04:57.594 --> 04:59.556
Come with me.

05:07.319 --> 05:09.441
Tell me something
you fantasise about.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.363
What do you mean?
Something that turns you on.

05:16.645 --> 05:18.926
This.
Where are we doing this?

05:20.807 --> 05:22.768
Where would you like to fuck me?

05:22.927 --> 05:24.889
Oh.

05:25.649 --> 05:27.611
Outside.

05:28.211 --> 05:30.212
Oh, in an alleyway.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.212
In a dirty alley.

05:32.693 --> 05:34.654
Er... OK.

05:36.615 --> 05:38.576
On a beach?

05:38.777 --> 05:40.698
Er...
In a field?

05:41.577 --> 05:43.899
On a farm?
Oh.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.541
The field's on the farm.

05:47.942 --> 05:50.583
I'm a country girl.
You're a farmer.

05:51.623 --> 05:53.584
Or a stable boy that seduced me.

05:56.385 --> 05:59.387
Can you see the stables?
Yeah, of course I can.

05:59.987 --> 06:02.634
Can you smell the horses?
I can smell the horses.

06:02.669 --> 06:06.511
They're making noises in the stalls,
getting very excited.

06:06.546 --> 06:08.592
Horses have giant cocks, don't they?

06:08.627 --> 06:10.638
Oh, yes. Yes, they do.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.800
Maybe you should take me
to the stable.

06:12.835 --> 06:15.635
Don't fuck the horse!
I'm not even gonna get close.

06:15.671 --> 06:17.682
It's too big.

06:17.717 --> 06:19.683
What's it doing?
The horse?

06:19.719 --> 06:22.399
The stallion, it's out of control.

06:23.561 --> 06:27.242
It's far too big. It sounds like
it's going to break the stall door.

06:27.277 --> 06:29.048
They're powerful horses!

06:29.083 --> 06:32.325
Very... powerful... horse.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.266
I tell everyone
I'm a legal secretary

07:02.301 --> 07:04.907
for one of those huge
international law firms.

07:04.943 --> 07:08.224
You know, the ones that need staff
at night to meet contract deadlines.

07:08.259 --> 07:09.910
It's so boring no-one asks about it.

07:09.945 --> 07:12.867
I can't even tell my best friend Ben
what I do for a living.

07:15.228 --> 07:17.274
Best custard tart in London, that.

07:17.309 --> 07:20.390
See the crust? That's not a machine,
that's hand-made.

07:20.425 --> 07:22.597
I thought Vanessa had you on a diet.
She does.

07:22.632 --> 07:25.313
I'm living on fucking tofu
but I eat leftovers at the club.

07:25.348 --> 07:27.320
You've been fatter.
I never put you on a diet.

07:27.355 --> 07:29.876
In every other way
you're the worst girlfriend ever.

07:29.910 --> 07:31.797
What?
Don't mess about.

07:32.117 --> 07:34.638
You never!
Look at the size of your chops!

07:34.673 --> 07:37.159
That's really nice.
Give it. Yes, I do.

08:00.732 --> 08:02.893
Fancy a game of
"spoilt little rich girl"?

08:02.928 --> 08:05.054
We haven't done that in a while?
That one.

08:11.297 --> 08:14.419
I think this is lovely.
Shame the pool's so small, though.

08:15.740 --> 08:19.062
We're not making a decision based on
pool size, Benjamin!

08:19.097 --> 08:21.023
It's a bit shit, though.

08:21.384 --> 08:23.344
Let's go on in.

08:27.666 --> 08:30.388
Oh, lush! This is perfect!

08:34.990 --> 08:37.552
Beautiful fireplace.
Oh, yeah, great.

08:39.111 --> 08:42.438
Barrister or QC?
No way. Stock broker.

08:42.474 --> 08:46.076
It's owned by a retired barrister
who wants to move out of London.

08:46.111 --> 08:48.037
He still loves the property.

08:48.998 --> 08:51.925
Sash windows.
Ya, I love a sash.

08:51.959 --> 08:55.522
Love it. Why don't you try the
acoustics? She trained in Vienna.

08:55.557 --> 08:58.843
Plays incredible Chopin.
That's terribly rude, Benjamin.

08:58.878 --> 09:00.804
Plays like an angel.

09:19.855 --> 09:21.815
Thanks very much. Goodbye.

09:24.096 --> 09:26.058
Chopin, you cunt!

09:29.539 --> 09:32.382
How does anyone ever afford to buy a
house in London?

09:32.416 --> 09:34.919
It's just about making the money.

09:34.955 --> 09:37.424
Four Seasons - Spring

09:39.065 --> 09:41.111
It's a nice hotel.

09:41.146 --> 09:44.607
Not big enough for an Arab. Not
expensive enough for an American.

09:44.642 --> 09:48.069
Not trendy enough for a young
professional. He'll be over 50.

09:48.104 --> 09:50.116
Long-term married.

09:50.151 --> 09:53.717
First time with an escort so I'm
guessing he'll be newly retired

09:53.753 --> 09:57.875
which has led to a drop in self-esteem
and a need to feel powerful and special.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.476
This is why I'm good at my job.

10:04.039 --> 10:05.999
Belle?

10:06.200 --> 10:08.121
Daniel?
Hi.

10:10.921 --> 10:12.883
Right, we'll get a drink, shall we?

10:22.809 --> 10:25.009
Why don't you just try lying back?
Sorry.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.892
Oh, God. God.

10:32.534 --> 10:35.094
Look at that, the hour's all gone.
Don't worry.

10:36.335 --> 10:39.297
No, look, I can't afford -
Don't worry, we'll get there.

10:40.018 --> 10:41.978
You just need to relax.

10:44.900 --> 10:47.021
Er... why don't you watch me
have a play?

11:09.713 --> 11:12.395
That's extraordinarily nice of you,
it's just...

11:13.916 --> 11:15.877
I have to er...

11:27.163 --> 11:29.124
I'm going to have to go actually.

11:30.805 --> 11:32.811
What? You're not staying here?

11:32.846 --> 11:36.047
No, I can't. I'm not a huge fan
of hotels, really.

11:37.168 --> 11:39.529
But you stay if you want.
I've already paid online.

11:39.564 --> 11:41.575
On my own?

11:41.610 --> 11:43.571
Well, if you like.

11:44.211 --> 11:46.773
I'm just offering so as not to
waste... any of...

11:48.975 --> 11:51.496
Thank you, though.
Thanks for your time.

11:52.616 --> 11:54.657
And I'm sorry...

11:54.692 --> 11:56.618
Belle.

12:03.061 --> 12:05.068
Enchante.
I- I-I'm sorry.

12:05.103 --> 12:07.504
Is there anything in particular
I haven't -

12:07.539 --> 12:09.465
Oh, no, no. It's just...

12:12.147 --> 12:14.108
Good night.

12:18.990 --> 12:20.951
Well, that's a first.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.287
Thank you.

12:39.363 --> 12:41.322
Just put it there, thank you.

12:42.961 --> 12:44.964
No-one else?

12:44.999 --> 12:47.018
Oh, well, probably for the best.

12:47.053 --> 12:49.036
Can't have anyone getting too hefty.

12:50.075 --> 12:52.034
And last but not least, Rachel.

12:53.032 --> 12:55.635
I make it 2,300.
No, it's 2,000.

12:55.670 --> 12:59.148
Rachel, look at me,
with my books, my records.

13:00.106 --> 13:02.065
Now look at you. With your roots.

13:03.584 --> 13:05.543
It's 2,300, sweetheart.

13:06.181 --> 13:08.580
I owe you the 300.
Yes, you do.

13:11.098 --> 13:13.056
Now, ugly mugs.

13:13.536 --> 13:16.893
This gentleman has been all over
town with fraudulent money.

13:16.928 --> 13:19.828
Shiny notes. He tried it on
with one of Bruce's girls.

13:19.862 --> 13:22.728
She said he spoke with an accent.
Eastern European.

13:22.764 --> 13:24.532
You can't say that.
No, it's racist.

13:24.567 --> 13:26.824
You can't be racist
against Eastern Europeans.

13:26.859 --> 13:29.150
You can be prejudiced.
I'm prejudiced, then.

13:29.185 --> 13:31.413
Then we're all agreed.
They are my people.

13:31.448 --> 13:33.639
Funny you're Swedish on the site,
then.

13:33.674 --> 13:35.044
Enough.

13:35.079 --> 13:37.036
Right, that's your lot.

13:37.196 --> 13:39.240
Where's Fiona?

13:39.274 --> 13:42.032
Apparently her bloke saw her photo
on the Internet.

13:42.068 --> 13:44.790
Recognised the underwear he bought
her for Christmas.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.029
I should get my pictures more
pixilated.

13:47.063 --> 13:49.072
No-one is getting more pixilated.

13:49.106 --> 13:51.425
They can barely make out your gender
as it is.

13:51.460 --> 13:53.880
I couldn't bear it if my parents
found out.

13:53.915 --> 13:56.266
Ladies, I've got another lot here in
a minute.

13:56.300 --> 14:00.177
And keep things free. Holiday
season coming up and all that.

14:04.014 --> 14:07.572
My young one from the other night,
Daniel, did you hear from him?

14:07.607 --> 14:09.611
Yes. He rang to book again,
actually.

14:09.646 --> 14:11.654
But I gave him someone else.

14:11.688 --> 14:15.005
He was more specific this time.
What did he want, then?

14:15.041 --> 14:18.323
He asked for "girl next door".
He said jeans, no make-up.

14:19.521 --> 14:22.279
Takes all sorts, I suppose.
Who have you given him to?

14:22.314 --> 14:25.277
Rachel.
Rachel. £300-short Rachel?

14:25.717 --> 14:27.675
Are you playing me?

14:28.355 --> 14:30.398
Now stop asking favours.

14:30.432 --> 14:32.872
If you're not going to eat anything,
fuck off.

14:33.351 --> 14:37.667
Hello. Yes, Gabriella is free.
Six o'clock is fine. Thank you.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.710
You know, I would order something

14:39.746 --> 14:42.064
but I'd be worried
you'd take 40% of my food.

15:05.644 --> 15:08.123
Sorry, I know you were expecting
someone else.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.246
Oh, no, no.

15:10.281 --> 15:12.319
Rachel's not well. It's not good.

15:12.354 --> 15:14.278
Right. Well, hurray!

15:14.998 --> 15:17.001
Well, not hurray -
So you've got me

15:17.036 --> 15:19.193
without the miracle
of hair and make-up.

15:21.270 --> 15:23.230
No, I like it.

15:25.268 --> 15:27.787
Er... we can put you
in a nice hot shower if you -

15:27.822 --> 15:29.744
Oh, yeah, of course.

15:38.298 --> 15:40.255
Why do you wear shoes
in your own flat?

15:41.015 --> 15:43.058
Sorry?

15:43.094 --> 15:45.732
It's just... it looks like you're on
your way out.

15:47.490 --> 15:49.448
Are you a fan of feet, then?

15:52.166 --> 15:54.125
Not like that.

16:52.718 --> 16:54.675
Hello.

16:55.155 --> 16:57.159
No problem.

16:57.194 --> 16:59.232
I'll call you after. OK.

17:08.465 --> 17:11.821
My girlfriend and I were together
for four years.

17:12.819 --> 17:14.824
And it's difficult.

17:14.858 --> 17:17.178
I mean, I meet other girls.

17:18.097 --> 17:20.054
I like some of them.

17:21.013 --> 17:23.058
But after half an hour or so

17:23.092 --> 17:26.888
I just realise how little I
appreciated...

17:27.689 --> 17:30.167
When did you find out?
At a party.

17:31.287 --> 17:33.244
She was with her chap.

17:34.163 --> 17:36.881
She's nine months. She's like...
She's right out.

17:39.479 --> 17:42.277
She looked exactly like
I always imagined she would.

17:42.312 --> 17:45.075
My sister's nine months pregnant
and looks like a Volvo.

17:48.271 --> 17:50.314
You don't have to do the other one.

17:50.350 --> 17:53.388
No, I do. I have to do both.
I have a thing.

17:53.424 --> 17:55.346
I like symmetry.

17:56.146 --> 17:59.582
Square numbers and palindromes.
What's a palindrome again?

18:00.383 --> 18:03.220
A word that's spelt the same
backwards as forwards

18:03.255 --> 18:06.057
like noon, level -
Hannah.

18:06.092 --> 18:08.016
Hannah.

18:09.894 --> 18:11.852
You're Hannah?

18:13.251 --> 18:15.211
Yeah.

18:43.067 --> 18:46.504
'Hi, this is Ben. I can't take your
call now. Leave me a message. '

19:52.730 --> 19:55.408
.. and now I'm asking you
to give him someone else.

19:56.288 --> 19:58.285
I'm unpredictable like that.

19:59.086 --> 20:01.284
I don't know,
tell him whatever you want.

20:17.790 --> 20:19.827
You're not gonna believe
what I found.

20:21.108 --> 20:23.825
I was quite a spoilt little girl
when I was younger.

20:25.343 --> 20:27.343
And one of the many lessons I had...

20:30.260 --> 20:33.537
Now, what I want to know is who
wears this?

20:33.572 --> 20:35.535
You or me?

20:43.609 --> 20:47.286
'Sometimes it's not the youngest or
the richest clients you want,

20:47.322 --> 20:49.444
or the ones you have most in common
with.

20:50.164 --> 20:53.881
For me, the perfect partner is one
where I never have to be myself. '

20:59.556 --> 21:02.874
Sometimes I get paid to do the
things I've always wanted to do.

21:03.912 --> 21:06.669
The most prestigious adult party in
the country.

21:06.704 --> 21:09.524
Oh, shit.
Sorry. I know him from somewhere.

21:09.559 --> 21:12.310
I was this close
to having the best sex ever.

21:12.345 --> 21:14.744
I like your work, by the way.
I like your work, too.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.519
Is it just me, or are you a little
overdressed for work, dear?

21:19.555 --> 21:23.098
Maybe later on when you are really
desperate I will fuck you.
