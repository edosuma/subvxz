[whispers] Psst. Ollie? Are you awake?

00:36.680 --> 00:37.680
[snoring]

00:38.160 --> 00:39.920
I need a snack so I can sleep.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.640
Something sweet. Like...

00:43.280 --> 00:45.760
some of that special honey
you eat every morning?

00:45.919 --> 00:47.120
Wanna have some with me?

00:47.280 --> 00:48.120
[snoring]

00:48.239 --> 00:50.199
Huh. He's fast asleep.

00:50.360 --> 00:51.400
What do I do?

00:51.720 --> 00:53.839
Maybe I should go back to bed.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.400
Or...

00:57.960 --> 01:00.160
Oh, there's not much left.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.680
Mmm.

01:03.959 --> 01:05.519
Just a little bit more.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.679
So good!

01:08.840 --> 01:11.640
Just one more teeny, tiny...

01:14.280 --> 01:15.759
Uh-oh.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.160
[yawn]

01:17.320 --> 01:19.840
Moon? What are you doing here?

01:19.960 --> 01:20.960
Huh?

01:21.119 --> 01:23.560
Um... That's a great question.

01:23.720 --> 01:28.200
See, I was feeling kind of snackish, so...

01:28.360 --> 01:32.039
I accidentally ate the last bit
of Ollie's special honey!

01:32.160 --> 01:35.240
The special honey
that his Auntie Char gives him

01:35.399 --> 01:37.440
for his birthday every year?

01:37.560 --> 01:38.440
Mmm-hmm.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.960
The special honey that tastes
like Scottish heather flowers?

01:42.119 --> 01:43.000
Mmm.

01:43.119 --> 01:45.839
That's only found in Scotland?

01:46.000 --> 01:46.880
Mmm-hmm.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.199
The special honey that...

01:48.360 --> 01:51.000
Yes! That honey!

01:51.160 --> 01:52.839
What are we gonna do?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.880
Ollie eats that honey
on his toast <i>every </i>morning

01:57.080 --> 01:59.399
right after he brushes his teeth
and gets dressed!

01:59.559 --> 02:03.839
-He can't change his routine!
-I know! Ollie hates change!

02:04.039 --> 02:05.559
[snoring]

02:05.679 --> 02:09.079
[gasps] Hold it.
I'm having a brainstorm!

02:09.199 --> 02:10.919
And when I have a brainstorm,

02:11.079 --> 02:13.480
Ollie always gets dragged off somewhere.

02:14.519 --> 02:19.799
What if we find a way to get Ollie
to wake up in Scotland?

02:19.959 --> 02:22.560
With a new jar
of his special heather honey

02:22.720 --> 02:23.600
right in front of him!

02:23.720 --> 02:25.480
Then he could keep his morning routine!

02:25.600 --> 02:29.600
But how are we going to get him
to Scotland while he sleeps?

02:33.200 --> 02:35.239
[snoring]

02:37.799 --> 02:40.160
Just one last thing. Packing!

02:40.640 --> 02:42.359
Toothbrush. Plaid underpants.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.600
Sandals...

02:43.720 --> 02:46.720
And a bunch of stuff he won't need,
because that's what Ollie would do.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.760
Flippers, unicycle, safari hat...

02:49.760 --> 02:51.280
[snoring]

02:52.840 --> 02:54.239
Here we go!

03:02.840 --> 03:04.200
Whoo!

03:10.720 --> 03:12.440
[whispering]
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

03:12.600 --> 03:15.640
<i>we're now approaching Scotland.</i>

03:20.840 --> 03:23.679
Ollie's still asleep.
Our plan is working!

03:23.840 --> 03:26.280
Now we just need to get
to that honey farm and...

03:26.399 --> 03:28.120
-Wah!
-Whoopsie!

03:30.160 --> 03:31.200
Oh, no!

03:33.280 --> 03:37.440
Double "oh, no!"
Wait for us here, Stanley!

03:37.560 --> 03:39.799
[yawns] No problem.

03:39.959 --> 03:42.720
I'm so sleepy
from the flight over that...

03:42.880 --> 03:44.239
[snoring]

03:46.519 --> 03:48.760
[yawns]

03:52.920 --> 03:54.640
[the sheeps bleat]
Huh?

03:55.119 --> 03:56.799
[he shouts]

03:56.959 --> 03:57.880
Morning, Ollie!

03:58.000 --> 04:00.760
Moon, what's going on?

04:00.920 --> 04:03.200
Why is my bed sliding down a hill?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.760
Surprise! I brought you to Scotland!

04:11.000 --> 04:13.760
Scotland! Why?

04:13.920 --> 04:17.479
-Um...
-Has anyone seen my golf ball?

04:17.599 --> 04:20.599
So you can see golfers in kilts!

04:20.760 --> 04:23.440
You know, those skirts
made out of Scottish plaid!

04:23.599 --> 04:26.000
Even some men wear them! Neat, huh?

04:26.159 --> 04:28.479
-Sure, but...
-But, best of all,

04:28.599 --> 04:31.360
so you could eat
heather-flavoured honey from...

04:31.520 --> 04:32.640
Kilt Farms!

04:34.159 --> 04:37.159
-Hmm. It's around here somewhere.
-Moon!

04:37.280 --> 04:39.240
You know I hate surprises!

04:39.400 --> 04:40.760
I like routines!

04:40.919 --> 04:44.520
Like how every single morning,
I must do three things!

04:44.680 --> 04:48.120
Brush your teeth, get dressed in your
plaid underpants and striped shirt,

04:48.280 --> 04:49.960
and eat toast with heather honey!

04:50.120 --> 04:52.440
-Exactly.
-Not to worry, Ollie!

04:52.599 --> 04:56.200
I brought everything you could
ever need for your routine!

04:57.120 --> 04:59.680
-You brought my toothbrush?
-Of course!

04:59.840 --> 05:02.320
But... I usually brush my teeth

05:02.479 --> 05:05.520
while I'm standing on a fuzzy
white bath mat.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.200
Did you bring my fuzzy white bath mat?

05:09.760 --> 05:12.479
I forgot to bring a mat. But, hey!

05:12.599 --> 05:14.560
[the sheeps bleat]
How about this?

05:14.680 --> 05:15.840
May we?

05:16.640 --> 05:19.159
Ta-dah! Your own Scottish bath mat!

05:23.000 --> 05:24.760
This is kind of comfy.

05:24.919 --> 05:26.560
I knew you'd like it, Ollie!

05:26.680 --> 05:28.960
Now, just one more thing to do
in your routine

05:29.120 --> 05:31.400
before it's time to eat honey on toast!

05:31.560 --> 05:33.039
[bell rings]

05:33.159 --> 05:34.479
Whoa!

05:34.599 --> 05:36.840
That must be their breakfast bell!

05:39.640 --> 05:42.280
Don't worry, Ollie!
I've got your backpack,

05:42.440 --> 05:45.280
so we'll still be able
to stick to your routine!

05:45.400 --> 05:46.880
Whoa!

05:48.680 --> 05:51.479
Whoopsie! Oh, not again!

05:54.000 --> 05:57.080
Oh, oh!
[chuckles] That tickles.

06:00.359 --> 06:03.520
-Sorry, Mr. Golfer Guy.
-Ah! Call me, Angus.

06:04.039 --> 06:06.560
And don't you worry.
That was kind of fun!

06:08.039 --> 06:11.520
[clears throat]
Moon, it's time for me to get dressed.

06:11.640 --> 06:12.760
Sure, Ollie!

06:12.880 --> 06:14.719
Here's your striped shirt,

06:14.840 --> 06:16.719
and now all you need is your...

06:18.640 --> 06:19.719
Uh-oh.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.320
All I need is my plaid underpants,

06:22.479 --> 06:24.200
hidden in this plaid cloth

06:24.320 --> 06:26.200
that looks exactly like them!

06:26.640 --> 06:28.120
Don't worry, Ollie.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.880
But we'll never find them in there!

06:30.159 --> 06:31.479
My routine is ruined!

06:31.599 --> 06:34.200
It's OK. I'm having a brainstorm!

06:38.200 --> 06:40.520
While you put on your shirt,
I'll find your underpants!

06:40.680 --> 06:42.240
OK? OK.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.840
Not here. No.

06:54.159 --> 06:55.560
Uh-oh.

06:55.719 --> 06:58.760
You look like a giant plaid burrito!

06:58.880 --> 07:01.320
Can you help me, Angus?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.799
Here's a little trick I know.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.039
Whoa!

07:07.239 --> 07:09.320
-Ta-dah!
-Yeah!

07:09.520 --> 07:12.640
One pair of plaid underpants,
ready for their routine!

07:12.760 --> 07:14.159
Ah! That's better.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.840
Now I just need to do
the last part of my routine,

07:17.000 --> 07:18.799
eat toast with heather honey!

07:18.960 --> 07:20.320
I've got that covered!

07:21.640 --> 07:23.760
All we have to do
is get back to Kilt Farms,

07:23.919 --> 07:25.280
which is right over...

07:25.919 --> 07:26.880
Um...

07:27.680 --> 07:28.960
It's...

07:31.320 --> 07:32.359
[embarrassed laugh]

07:32.479 --> 07:34.000
I forgot to bring a map.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.239
What?

07:35.359 --> 07:38.239
You took me
on a surprise trip to Scotland

07:38.359 --> 07:39.760
and you didn't bring a map?

07:39.880 --> 07:40.919
You're right.

07:41.039 --> 07:42.479
I should have thought of the map.

07:42.599 --> 07:46.080
But I can still fix this, because...

07:47.320 --> 07:50.039
Because where there are bees,
there's honey!

07:50.159 --> 07:51.799
We shouldn't bother a bee, Moon.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.280
And we're not going to, Ollie.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.560
We're just gonna follow it.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.640
I've ruined your routine.

08:31.760 --> 08:35.439
Sometimes, well,
I do things without thinking.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.880
It's OK, Moon.

08:37.039 --> 08:39.360
I know you didn't mean
to ruin my routine.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.679
-Mmm-mmm.
-Aw, come on, Moon!

08:41.840 --> 08:43.919
I can't stand seeing you sad!

08:44.039 --> 08:47.720
Our friendship is way more important
than my honey on toast.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.959
-It is?
-Of course! And you know what?

08:51.120 --> 08:53.520
Today, for the first time ever,

08:53.680 --> 08:55.720
I'll eat something else for breakfast!

08:55.920 --> 08:57.240
Seriously?

08:57.360 --> 09:00.319
My best friend Ollie is going to...

09:00.439 --> 09:02.240
change his routine?

09:02.400 --> 09:03.840
[Angus laughs]

09:04.040 --> 09:08.120
You bumped into me and caused me
to hit my first hole in one!

09:08.319 --> 09:10.680
You mean you hit the ball
and got it in the hole

09:10.840 --> 09:12.520
with just one try?

09:12.640 --> 09:15.439
Exactly! How can I thank you?

09:15.640 --> 09:18.319
Do you happen to know
where my friend Ollie can get some toast

09:18.480 --> 09:20.560
and something delicious to spread on it?

09:20.720 --> 09:23.920
Yeah, a nice nut butter, maybe,
or an interesting jam.

09:24.040 --> 09:28.240
I have an even better idea!
Come to my farm!

09:32.120 --> 09:35.120
You own Kilt Farms? What luck!

09:35.280 --> 09:37.199
You must know my Auntie Char!

09:37.360 --> 09:39.800
Of course! She's my best customer!

09:39.959 --> 09:41.680

-Stanley?
-Stanley?

09:45.680 --> 09:48.839
Friend of yours?
I found him asleep on the hillside.

09:48.959 --> 09:52.319
How about we all have
some Kilt Farms heather-flavoured honey?

09:52.439 --> 09:54.800
I'll go make some more toast!

09:58.560 --> 09:59.680
Mmm.

10:00.280 --> 10:04.480
-Yes! My morning routine is complete!
-Mmm.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.880
I can see why you like to eat
this every single morning.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.920
I love that you gave me this special
surprise adventure in Scotland.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.199
Actually,

10:13.360 --> 10:16.000
the real reason we're here is...

10:16.160 --> 10:19.079
Last night, I ate the very last bit
of your heather honey.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.600
I'm sorry!

10:20.760 --> 10:23.439
I know it was wrong of me
to eat it without your permission!

10:23.880 --> 10:27.040
But it wasn't my last jar, Moon!

10:27.160 --> 10:28.199
Say wha-huh?

10:28.319 --> 10:31.800
I always keep an emergency back-up jar
in my sock drawer.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.760
So you could have had
your routine back at home?

10:34.920 --> 10:37.079
Yep! But then we wouldn't have done

10:37.240 --> 10:39.439
all these fun Scottish things!

10:39.560 --> 10:42.600
Still, no more surprise adventures.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.800
-OK, Moon?
-Deal!

10:44.920 --> 10:46.360
[laughter]

10:47.920 --> 10:51.560
Is there anything better than all this
heather-flavoured honey, Ollie?

10:51.720 --> 10:53.240
Just one thing!
