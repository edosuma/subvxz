No more meat

01:04.370 --> 01:05.703
What are you watchin'?

01:05.770 --> 01:08.203
A talk show on
the dangers of eating meat.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.003
Did you know that when you die

01:10.070 --> 01:13.070
you'll have ten pounds
of undigested meat in your body?

01:13.136 --> 01:16.036
Well, I guess,
I won't die hungry then.

My baby sister's
on that flight

02:10.210 --> 02:13.476
and I need to know exactly
what time she's due here?

what movie they're showin'?

02:17.909 --> 02:20.310
Uh, hello? Hello?

Excuse me, but this is

buckeye is a nut like seed

02:41.410 --> 02:44.143
from the horse chestnut variety.

02:44.210 --> 02:47.376
Synclaire, there's a reason
why that's a little known fact.

02:47.443 --> 02:49.243
Nobody cares!

02:49.310 --> 02:52.343
When Overton's sister gets here,
I wanna make a good impression.

02:52.410 --> 02:54.443
Then put the book down.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.643
Look, just stop naggin' me
about the damn meat now.

03:01.816 --> 03:04.283
Yo, Obie, you rushed us up,
where's you sister?

03:04.350 --> 03:06.583
Oh, she'll be here
in about two hours.

03:06.650 --> 03:08.616
I just didn't
want y'all to be late.

03:08.683 --> 03:10.650
I mean, you know
how you ladies are.

03:10.716 --> 03:12.416
Two hours?

03:12.483 --> 03:14.783
You only have 45 minutes
worth of snacks here.

03:16.350 --> 03:18.883
I can't for you ladies
to meet my sister Olivia.

03:18.950 --> 03:21.583
You're gonna love her.
She's beautiful, intelligent

03:21.650 --> 03:24.016
yet sensitive and innocent.

03:24.083 --> 03:26.216
basically,
a female version of me.

03:27.516 --> 03:28.950
Is she bald?

03:35.216 --> 03:37.483
You know, I haven't seen
Olivia for years

03:37.550 --> 03:40.316
but I remember her being
a scrawny, little kid

03:40.383 --> 03:41.983
always following us around.

03:42.050 --> 03:44.416
Well, she couldn't
help herself, she idolized me.

03:44.483 --> 03:46.850
Called me,
Obie‐walk‐o‐nobie.

04:08.590 --> 04:10.523
Uh, Olivia?

04:13.490 --> 04:15.423
‐ Livie!
‐ Obie!

04:17.156 --> 04:19.123
Olivia.

04:20.356 --> 04:22.123
So, what you
doin' here so early?

04:22.190 --> 04:24.556
And with 'em
tight pants on?

04:24.623 --> 04:26.056
You know, mom and dad.

04:26.123 --> 04:28.523
We were at the airport
four hours early.

04:28.590 --> 04:31.890
So, when dad and his tool belt
got stuck at the metal detector

04:31.956 --> 04:33.923
I hopped on an earlier flight.

04:33.989 --> 04:35.256
Hello, Olivia.

04:35.323 --> 04:38.256
How are things in Cleveland,
home of the Plain Dealer

04:38.323 --> 04:40.656
circulation 3,45,000?

04:40.723 --> 04:42.990
‐ You must be Synclaire.
‐ Yes.

04:44.823 --> 04:47.423
I told you that research
will pay off, I'm in.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.756
Oh, and you must be Regine.

04:51.823 --> 04:53.890
That's a very classy
on samba, girl.

04:53.956 --> 04:55.590
What? Uh, uh‐oh..

04:55.656 --> 04:58.323
Girl, this is just
somethin' I through together.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.256
[laughter]

05:00.323 --> 05:03.363
Yes, looks real nice
with payless shoes.

05:06.730 --> 05:08.563
Max?

05:08.630 --> 05:11.563
I'm Khadijah.
What have you heard about me?

05:11.630 --> 05:15.363
That you're a lot calmer
now that you've got a man.

05:15.430 --> 05:18.630
And, uh, that you should
give Synclaire A's.

05:20.096 --> 05:23.330
I'm calmer...but I ain't crazy.

05:25.463 --> 05:29.463
Hey, Kyle. Check you out,
tryin' to grow a goatee.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.963
Oh, well, check you out.
Tryin' to grow into a woman.

05:34.730 --> 05:37.296
Not just a woman, a botanist.

05:37.363 --> 05:39.096
Oh, I'm very impressed.

05:39.163 --> 05:41.896
Perhaps you can tell us
how we can save our phycus.

05:41.963 --> 05:43.163
[laughing]

05:43.230 --> 05:45.263
It's plastic, dusty.

05:49.196 --> 05:52.363
Hey, y'all, I got everything
we need for the Obie special.

05:52.430 --> 05:55.496
We got the smoked turkey.
We got provolone.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.663
‐ We got peanut butter.
‐ Chunky style.

05:57.730 --> 05:59.430
Mm, that's right.

05:59.496 --> 06:03.103
Alfalfa sprouts,
mayonnaise, corn chips.

06:03.170 --> 06:05.270
All on a Sourdough bun.

06:05.336 --> 06:08.070
But wait a minute...
something's missing.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.203
‐ M&Ms.
‐ M&Ms.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.703
Left 'em upstairs,
I'll be right back.

06:13.770 --> 06:16.270
So, Olivia, Obie
and I thought you might like

06:16.336 --> 06:18.570
to visit the botanical gardens
this afternoon.

06:18.636 --> 06:20.870
‐ Sounds like a plan.
‐ Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

06:20.936 --> 06:22.703
I thought you hated
the botanical gardens.

06:22.770 --> 06:25.270
Remember, the last time
you went there you came back

06:25.336 --> 06:28.470
with that rash,
the doctors couldn't identify.

06:28.536 --> 06:31.770
Then there was those berries,
you had no business eating.

06:32.936 --> 06:35.603
Excuse me, I'm trying
to bond here, okay?

06:36.703 --> 06:38.136
H‐hey.

06:40.370 --> 06:44.136
So, tell me. Was Kyle as much
of a dork then as he is now?

06:45.570 --> 06:47.670
Actually, Kyle
was very cool.

06:48.836 --> 06:50.103
Thank you.

06:51.503 --> 06:52.970
Oh, he had it goin' on.

06:53.036 --> 06:55.770
He even had his own singin'
group. It was called Water.

06:55.836 --> 06:57.136
(Kyle)
'Yeah.'

06:57.203 --> 07:00.343
We were the missing element
from Earth, wind and fire.

07:02.110 --> 07:04.376
They used to win
all the local challenge shows

07:04.443 --> 07:06.943
and Overton wanted to be
in that group so bad

07:07.010 --> 07:08.343
but Kyle wouldn't let him.

07:08.410 --> 07:09.976
Because the man
couldn't harmonize.

07:10.043 --> 07:11.510
But because he was my boy

07:11.576 --> 07:13.810
I let him be part of
the Water experience.

07:13.876 --> 07:15.610
That's right.
That's right.

07:15.676 --> 07:19.043
At the end of the show Overton
would wrap a red velvet cape

07:19.110 --> 07:21.776
around Kyle's shoulders
and help him off stage.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.543
[laughter]

07:25.610 --> 07:30.343
Oh, my God. The red velvet cape.
My God, you were super dork.

07:34.676 --> 07:36.076
Tofu!

07:36.143 --> 07:38.543
That's how my new
trademark greeting. Like it?

07:38.610 --> 07:40.243
(all)
No.

07:41.010 --> 07:43.443
Ew, how can you eat that?

07:43.510 --> 07:46.310
Don't you realize
that a meat diet accelerates

07:46.376 --> 07:48.110
the aging process?

07:48.176 --> 07:51.376
And it inflates that hidden tire
around your mid‐section.

07:53.476 --> 07:56.843
Regine, we cannot store fat
in our heads like you.

07:59.510 --> 08:04.083
You know, I dated a vegetarian
once and he was always sick.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.116
Of course he removed
asbestos but...still.

08:08.916 --> 08:12.016
Hey, Regine, where's that half
a pot roast we had in there?

08:12.083 --> 08:14.716
I threw it away
along with rest of the meat

08:14.783 --> 08:18.150
but I'm replacing it
with cleansing wheatgrass.

08:19.883 --> 08:21.816
Oh! Oh, hell no.

08:22.883 --> 08:24.816
Uh‐uh!

08:24.883 --> 08:27.883
You did not just throw away
the turkey sausage?

08:27.950 --> 08:31.616
You'll thank me
when you're toxin free.

08:31.683 --> 08:34.816
I'll thank you when there's
dead turkey in this freezer.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.515
What is that?

08:38.582 --> 08:42.150
Delicious. A sip of this,
it'll change your life.

08:51.283 --> 08:54.750
What? It's a wheatgrass
and cabbage whip.

08:54.816 --> 08:57.116
I bet $5 she don't
make it to bathroom.

08:57.183 --> 08:59.016
Alright, let's go.

08:59.083 --> 09:02.390
Obie special tasted
a lot better when I was ten.

09:02.456 --> 09:04.956
Now, he still has to
put the M&Ms on them.

09:05.023 --> 09:07.556
Yeah, he's probably upstairs
picking out the cracked ones.

09:07.623 --> 09:10.623
He don't want me
to scrape my tongue.

09:10.690 --> 09:12.990
He still dotes on you
after all these years.

09:13.056 --> 09:14.356
Tell me about it.

09:14.423 --> 09:17.690
This morning he wakes me with
a floss bowl in his hand saying

09:17.756 --> 09:19.856
"Wake up, Livie.
It's tooth time."

09:21.256 --> 09:23.756
Now, you cannot blame a man
for wanting to protect

09:23.823 --> 09:25.756
a smile like that.

09:28.856 --> 09:32.123
So, Kyle, do you
have someone special

09:32.190 --> 09:34.456
that takes care of you that way?

09:34.523 --> 09:37.890
‐ No, not really.
‐ No girlfriend?

09:37.956 --> 09:41.556
A‐ha! Well, I'm still
exploring the possibilities.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.856
Hm, that sounds like fun.

09:45.390 --> 09:46.456
O‐Overton.

09:46.523 --> 09:49.190
Hey, Livie, sorry,
it took me so long but..

09:49.256 --> 09:51.890
..the water valve broke and
damn near flooded the basement.

09:54.256 --> 09:57.256
I gotta get a couple of 'em
three quarter inch reducers.

09:57.323 --> 10:00.056
Mm‐mm, mm‐mm, for a job that
size maybe you should use

10:00.123 --> 10:02.996
a two and a half inch
reducing T instead.

10:03.063 --> 10:05.296
Mm, dad would be so proud.

10:06.496 --> 10:07.730
But you know this means

10:07.796 --> 10:10.330
I can't go with you
to botanical gardens, right?

10:10.396 --> 10:11.863
Oh, that's alright,
I'll just, um..

10:11.930 --> 10:14.096
...catch a flick
or somethin' with Kyle.

10:16.196 --> 10:17.896
That okay with you, shorty?

10:17.963 --> 10:20.196
If it's okay
with you, it's okay with me.

10:20.263 --> 10:23.496
‐ Give me that.
‐ Good. Then it's settled.

10:23.563 --> 10:25.430
Obie, stop.

10:25.496 --> 10:28.696
Alright. Well, here's
some money for some snacks.

10:28.763 --> 10:31.996
Now, make sure
she doesn't get any caramel

10:32.063 --> 10:34.063
'cause it's bad for her teeth.

10:36.563 --> 10:39.363
No. When I suggested we go
to Washington Square Park

10:39.430 --> 10:40.930
to play chess with the pro's

10:40.996 --> 10:43.496
I thought I was gonna be
the one impressing you.

10:43.563 --> 10:46.330
Hey, I was a big time chess
champion two years running.

10:46.396 --> 10:50.330
You whacked out the board with
that snout nose eight year old.

10:50.396 --> 10:52.963
Hey, anyway,
that wad of money was on.

10:53.030 --> 10:54.330
Ha ha ha ha.

11:07.203 --> 11:09.236
Hey, get off my lil' sister.

11:17.203 --> 11:20.270
Overton, I can't
believe you did this.

11:20.336 --> 11:22.436
I can't believe
y'all doing that.

11:22.503 --> 11:27.470
‐ Kyle, are you okay?
‐ Italian suede jacket.

11:27.536 --> 11:31.936
‐ Sorry, man, but I saw you‐‐
‐ Mm‐mm, raw silk pants, man.

11:33.036 --> 11:34.970
Lacey black bra.

11:37.436 --> 11:39.403
I can show my bra if I want.

11:39.470 --> 11:41.103
‐ No, you can't.
‐ Yes, I can.

11:41.170 --> 11:42.903
Not as long as
I'm your brother.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.303
Overton, I'm a grown woman

11:44.370 --> 11:48.170
and I'll not let you
treat me like a child.

11:48.236 --> 11:50.870
Olivia, don't run up those
stairs. Your feet are wet.

11:50.936 --> 11:52.570
You might slip and fall!

11:56.503 --> 11:59.003
Okay, everything's going
accordin' to the plan we got.

11:59.070 --> 12:01.243
Everything we need
to torture Regine.

12:01.310 --> 12:04.076
Okay, we got the ribs,
the steaks, the chicken

12:04.143 --> 12:05.176
the hot links.

12:05.243 --> 12:06.810
No potato salad?

12:08.143 --> 12:10.210
Regine must be stopped.

12:10.276 --> 12:13.610
That mean this barbeque
has to be meat and meat only.

12:13.676 --> 12:15.476
No coleslaw?

12:16.843 --> 12:18.510
No! No.

12:18.576 --> 12:21.376
This is payback...for Regine
throwin' away all the good food

12:21.443 --> 12:24.210
and replacin' it
with plant life.

12:24.276 --> 12:25.843
No butterbeans?

12:27.410 --> 12:32.343
Synclaire, there are
no side dishes. Just meat.

12:33.843 --> 12:36.743
Oh, I get it.
Okay.

12:39.243 --> 12:40.176
Hey, la..

12:40.243 --> 12:41.710
[sneezes]

12:41.776 --> 12:43.410
You've got a cold?

12:43.476 --> 12:45.843
I can't believe
Overton did this.

12:45.910 --> 12:47.643
Oh, that's my
own fault, really.

12:47.710 --> 12:50.410
Sitting around soaking in
my fine wet clothing.

12:52.376 --> 12:55.776
Okay, y'all, Obie's barbeque pit
is open for business.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.976
Well, let the meat fest begin.

13:00.516 --> 13:03.850
Uh, Livie,
that's your second beer.

13:06.583 --> 13:11.316
Obie, my first was last night
and would you get off my case?

13:11.383 --> 13:14.283
Look here, when you're
in my care, you follow my rules.

13:15.683 --> 13:19.150
‐ Well, you can kiss my butt.
‐ Oh, no.

13:19.216 --> 13:22.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no fighting.

13:22.150 --> 13:25.750
We're all a big family here.
Now, let's all just apologize.

13:25.816 --> 13:28.150
Apologizing isn't gonna
make it any better.

13:28.216 --> 13:31.016
He apologized to Kyle yesterday
and he's still a wreck.

13:31.083 --> 13:32.183
Aren't you, Kyle?

13:32.250 --> 13:34.416
Look, take note.
I'm just sittin' here.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.750
A little lower.

13:38.816 --> 13:42.150
‐ Livie, what are you doin'?
‐ Relaxing Kyle.

13:42.216 --> 13:43.883
Poor, baby, mm‐hmm.

13:43.950 --> 13:46.883
Olivia Imogene Jones,
stop that!

13:49.016 --> 13:52.416
What are you gonna do,
pour barbeque sauce on us?

13:52.483 --> 13:53.516
Alright, alright,
alright alright.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.883
Enough, enough,
enough. Look.

13:55.950 --> 13:58.850
Overton, man,
you're my best friend, alright?

13:58.916 --> 14:02.956
Olivia, you have
the hands of magic.

14:03.023 --> 14:05.256
But I'm not gonna be
caught in the middle

14:05.323 --> 14:07.290
simply 'cause you wanna
prove something to him

14:07.356 --> 14:09.490
and you wanna
control her. No, no.

14:11.090 --> 14:15.256
You know, my mother always
told me, you Jones' was crazy.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.923
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'd rather be in Cleveland!

14:22.490 --> 14:23.523
(Olivia)
'Ugh!'

14:23.590 --> 14:24.990
Well, who wouldn't.

14:25.056 --> 14:29.056
It's got more parts per square
mile than any other urban area.

14:30.056 --> 14:32.156
(all)
'Shut her up.'

14:35.690 --> 14:38.056
Wow, I just came up
to check on you.

14:38.123 --> 14:40.090
I had no idea
you're planning to leave.

14:40.156 --> 14:43.156
I don't even know where I'm
going, I wanna get outta here.

14:43.223 --> 14:44.956
I understand what
you're going through, Olivia.

14:45.023 --> 14:47.556
Overton can be so annoying.
I don't blame you‐‐

14:47.623 --> 14:50.923
I'm not the little girl he
used to take to the playground.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.323
Certainly not‐‐

14:52.390 --> 14:55.656
When we played in the sandbox,
he'd sift the sand to make sure

14:55.723 --> 14:56.956
there were no pointy rocks.

14:57.023 --> 15:00.096
And you know what else? He built
guard rails on the slide

15:00.163 --> 15:01.763
to keep me from falling off.

15:01.830 --> 15:04.163
But you know, he comes
from a good place.

15:04.230 --> 15:07.996
Who care where he comes from?
He's still annoying.

15:08.063 --> 15:10.796
If you think he's such a pain
then why'd you bother

15:10.863 --> 15:12.696
come visit him
in the first place?

15:12.763 --> 15:15.330
Uh, I was gettin'
on my parents nerves, too.

15:17.196 --> 15:20.063
But you've got to admit,
that if you didn't love him

15:20.130 --> 15:21.930
you wouldn't
get this mad at him.

15:21.996 --> 15:24.663
Sometimes I get so mad
at Overton I just wanna

15:24.730 --> 15:28.030
shake him, and kick him and lock
and lock him in the basement

15:28.096 --> 15:31.596
but it's at those moments I know
how deep my love for him runs.

15:33.930 --> 15:37.430
Wow, you really do care
about him, don't you?

15:37.496 --> 15:39.463
And I think you do too.

15:40.963 --> 15:43.430
So, are you stayin'?

15:47.563 --> 15:50.896
I guess I have to, I can't seem
to pack with you around.

15:57.830 --> 16:02.236
Ha‐ha, Regine, join us,
there's plenty for everyone.

16:02.303 --> 16:05.703
Yeah, we got chicken,
beef ribs, beef tips

16:05.770 --> 16:08.870
beef fries, just plain beef
and I don't know what this is

16:08.936 --> 16:10.903
but it's some kinda meat.

16:12.870 --> 16:14.770
Nothing for me?

16:14.836 --> 16:18.336
Regine, now don't
take this personally.

16:20.003 --> 16:22.703
Because we looked everywhere
and I mean everywhere..

16:22.770 --> 16:25.970
...for somethin'
for you...to eat.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.236
But we just
couldn't find anything.

16:36.570 --> 16:40.536
Well, I'll just be right back
with my‐my‐my‐my

16:40.603 --> 16:42.536
summer squash
and my oatmeal loaf..

16:43.870 --> 16:45.970
Damn, she didn't break.

16:46.036 --> 16:47.770
Give her time.

16:50.536 --> 16:54.703
So, I guess Max ate all
the hot links already, huh?

16:54.770 --> 16:55.770
I shouldn't be surprised.

16:55.836 --> 16:57.836
There're no bones
to slow her down.

17:00.210 --> 17:02.643
Hey, uh, saved you
a little somethin', shorty.

17:02.710 --> 17:04.643
A peace offering.

17:06.576 --> 17:08.042
Thanks, man.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.376
Um, look, I just wanna say

17:10.443 --> 17:13.194
I'm sorry about
this whole Olivia thing.

17:13.261 --> 17:15.527
I guess, I did get
a little crazy.

17:15.594 --> 17:18.327
Well, I would've done
the same thing if I was you

17:18.394 --> 17:20.394
but in your case,
I'd have only ruined

17:20.461 --> 17:22.394
about $40 worth of clothes.

17:23.694 --> 17:26.060
Hey, I just don't know
what's gotten into her.

17:26.127 --> 17:29.427
Overton, she's a young woman,
man. She's just testing limits.

17:29.494 --> 17:31.694
No, she never used
to be like that.

17:31.761 --> 17:34.561
I mean, why she gotta be so
different? I haven't changed.

17:34.627 --> 17:35.994
Maybe that's the problem.

17:36.061 --> 17:39.594
Well, maybe you need
to give me back my hot link.

17:39.661 --> 17:41.261
Thanks, Kyle.

17:43.894 --> 17:45.794
You people thought
that you cleared out

17:45.861 --> 17:47.761
all of my health food, well..

17:47.827 --> 17:50.094
...you missed something. Ah!

17:52.061 --> 17:55.727
So, grill it up, Obie, and don't
you be stingy with the sauce.

17:55.794 --> 17:57.727
So, Olivia..

17:57.794 --> 18:01.301
...Cleveland is supposed to be
the city of brotherly love.

18:01.367 --> 18:04.467
Oh, no, wait.
Now, that's Philly.

18:04.534 --> 18:06.967
Anyway, go talk
to your brother. Go, go, go.

18:11.201 --> 18:12.801
I really like Synclaire.

18:12.867 --> 18:15.967
Yeah, well,
she's really likeable.

18:16.034 --> 18:18.867
You know, you look a lot
like dad working this grill.

18:18.934 --> 18:22.501
Except you're not setting
that side of the house on fire.

18:22.567 --> 18:26.001
Yeah, dad always was a might
generous with a lighter fluid

18:26.067 --> 18:27.367
[chuckles]

18:27.434 --> 18:29.434
I see you're in a better mood.

18:29.501 --> 18:31.867
Yeah. I figured
I'd hang out a while

18:31.934 --> 18:33.867
spend time
with my big brother.

18:33.934 --> 18:37.467
See if I could make out with
a few more of your friends.

18:37.534 --> 18:38.534
Yeah, ha‐ha.

18:38.601 --> 18:40.334
Well, I know
a couple of firemen

18:40.401 --> 18:42.501
they're used to
being hit by water.

18:44.201 --> 18:46.934
Overton, you know, there's
a lot you don't know about me.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.234
I mean,
I'm a practicing Buddhist.

18:49.301 --> 18:51.034
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

18:51.101 --> 18:53.801
And Kyle was not
the first guy I've kissed.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.501
In fact, I've kissed
and dated a lot of guys.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.734
Yusuf, the boxer.

18:58.801 --> 19:00.741
‐ Danny, the masseur.
‐ Oh.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.774
Robert, the gynecologist.
Ooh!

19:04.274 --> 19:06.641
Alright, alright.
Fine, I get your point.

19:06.707 --> 19:08.974
Your love life
is your business. Fine.

19:09.041 --> 19:11.741
Not just my love life, my life.

19:11.807 --> 19:14.674
Hey, I hear you, but you're
still my little sister.

19:14.741 --> 19:17.241
No matter how old you get,
that's not gonna change.

19:17.307 --> 19:20.307
Best thing I can do
is just try.

19:20.374 --> 19:23.141
You know, see, you got
a little sauce right there.

19:25.174 --> 19:26.907
Can you get that for me?

19:28.274 --> 19:32.041
Damn, girl, how many holes
you got in your ear?

19:36.674 --> 19:38.441
La‐la‐la.

19:39.341 --> 19:41.007
Mm. Perfect.

19:42.574 --> 19:46.207
O‐oh! Mm!

19:46.274 --> 19:48.107
Scrumptious.

19:48.174 --> 19:51.007
So good and so good for me.

19:54.374 --> 19:57.707
Regine, would you like
a bite of my hamburger?

19:57.774 --> 19:59.941
No, no.

20:00.007 --> 20:02.614
I want to eat
the whole thing.

20:02.681 --> 20:05.181
Put the hamburger down,
put your hands in your pocket

20:05.247 --> 20:07.681
and nobody gets hurt.

20:07.747 --> 20:09.714
Regine, you're not gonna
get away with this.

20:09.781 --> 20:11.714
Khadijah, put them ribs in here.

20:13.314 --> 20:15.081
Now!

20:17.947 --> 20:19.414
Max..

20:20.914 --> 20:22.881
...hot links

20:28.781 --> 20:29.947
Careful.

20:32.781 --> 20:34.247
Regine, this is
going too far.

20:34.314 --> 20:36.047
We're just trying
to make a point.

20:36.114 --> 20:37.581
I'm saying, look,
Regine, why don't‐‐

20:37.647 --> 20:40.214
Shut up and get away
from that table.

20:41.681 --> 20:43.714
I'm gonna eat everything now.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.781
Don't look at me.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.181
I can't do it,
I promised myself

20:58.247 --> 21:00.354
and I gotta stick
to my principles.

21:00.421 --> 21:03.187
I wanna die young like you all.

21:09.421 --> 21:10.821
I guess,
you're serious, huh?

21:10.887 --> 21:13.387
I thought, this was another
one of your little wimps.

21:13.454 --> 21:15.954
Like the time you waved
that crystal over your food

21:16.021 --> 21:17.087
to dissolve the fat.

21:17.154 --> 21:19.221
Hey, it worked for Liz Taylor.

21:19.287 --> 21:22.021
Well, if you don't wanna eat
meat I can respect that

21:22.087 --> 21:24.054
but don't tell us
how to live.

21:24.121 --> 21:25.487
You're right.

21:25.554 --> 21:28.054
Besides, if I can't change
the way you people dress

21:28.121 --> 21:29.954
I'll never change
the way y'all eat.

21:30.021 --> 21:31.187
Right.

21:32.221 --> 21:34.387
Fire's gettin' a little low.

21:34.454 --> 21:36.187
Just give it a little kick.

21:38.154 --> 21:39.621
Oh, my..

21:46.421 --> 21:50.054
Ah, I'm sick of eating meat.

21:50.121 --> 21:54.387
See, Max. Some part of you wants
to become a vegetarian too.

21:54.454 --> 21:58.221
Please, I just need a little
dessert to cope my stomach.

21:58.287 --> 22:01.894
Where's that cheese cake
you hid? I‐I'm gonna get it.

22:01.961 --> 22:04.294
I swear, she's got a tapeworm.

22:07.294 --> 22:08.627
Oh, my..

22:17.161 --> 22:18.894
[laughing]

22:20.027 --> 22:23.761
Goodnight, everyone.
God bless.
