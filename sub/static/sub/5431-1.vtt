01:15.200 --> 01:20.662
As l turn up the collar
On my favorite winter coat

01:20.830 --> 01:24.333
This wind is blowin' my mind

01:24.667 --> 01:27.336
I see the kids in the street

01:27.504 --> 01:29.713
With not enough to eat

01:29.881 --> 01:35.177
Who am l to be blind?
Pretending not to see their need

01:35.470 --> 01:37.846
A summer's disregard

01:38.014 --> 01:40.474
A broken bottle top

01:40.642 --> 01:44.394
And a one man's soul

01:44.562 --> 01:48.148
They follow each other
On the wind, you know

01:49.025 --> 01:52.319
'Cause they got nowhere to go

01:52.487 --> 01:54.988
That's why I want you to know

01:55.156 --> 01:58.534
I'm starting with the man in the mirror

02:00.036 --> 02:04.164

On July 7, these five brothers

06:08.868 --> 06:10.202
...at Madison Square Garden.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.288
Yes, I'm The Real
Don Steele, and here's the Jackson 5.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.375
I hope you caught these kids
on The Ed Sullivan Show last night.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.794
From the fact-is-stranger-than-fiction department:

06:18.961 --> 06:21.421
Michael Jackson
built a shrine to Elizabeth Taylor...

06:21.589 --> 06:23.382
...in the bedroom of his Encino home.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.426
Michael Jackson was
admitted with severe burns to his scalp...

06:26.594 --> 06:27.719
...as far as we know.

06:27.887 --> 06:28.970
Michael Jackson.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.807
The Guinness Book of World Records
has listed Thriller...

06:31.974 --> 06:34.643
...as the biggest-selling album of all time.

06:34.811 --> 06:38.021
Michael Jackson has become
the first artist in the history of music...

06:38.189 --> 06:41.066
...to generate six
number-one singles off one album.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.901
The album, of course, is Bad.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.903
What Michael Jackson has achieved...

06:45.071 --> 06:46.822
...is a tribute to 20 years of hard work...

06:46.989 --> 06:48.990
...energy, tireless dedication.

06:49.158 --> 06:52.202
Your success
is an American dream come true.

06:59.919 --> 07:06.091
We've been together

07:06.259 --> 07:09.386
For such a long time

07:09.554 --> 07:11.680
Now music

07:13.182 --> 07:20.522
Music and me

07:23.151 --> 07:29.406
Don't care whether

07:29.574 --> 07:32.200
All our songs rhyme

07:32.368 --> 07:34.536
Now music

07:36.080 --> 07:42.252
Music and me

07:56.017 --> 07:59.436

07:59.604 --> 08:00.729
To show you that I love you

08:00.897 --> 08:04.191
Won't you please let me

08:04.358 --> 08:05.400
Back in your heart

08:05.568 --> 08:07.486
Oh, ABC

08:07.653 --> 08:09.988
-It's easy as
-1, 2, 3

08:10.156 --> 08:12.199
-As simple as
-Do, re, mi

08:12.366 --> 08:14.618
ABC, 1 , 2, 3

08:14.785 --> 08:17.245
Baby, you and me, girl

08:17.413 --> 08:19.915
Stop! The love you save may be your own

08:20.082 --> 08:23.084
Darling, look both ways
Before you cross me

08:23.252 --> 08:25.420
Headed for a danger zone

08:26.839 --> 08:29.090
Slow down, slow down

08:29.258 --> 08:31.343
I may be a little fella

08:31.802 --> 08:34.095
But my heart is big as Texas

08:34.554 --> 08:37.097
I have all the love a man can give

08:37.265 --> 08:38.933
And maybe a little bit extra

08:39.101 --> 08:44.689
When l

08:44.857 --> 08:48.527
Had you

08:48.694 --> 08:55.242
I treated you bad

08:55.409 --> 08:57.786
And wrong, my dear

08:57.954 --> 09:00.539
And, girl, since

09:00.706 --> 09:05.418
Since you went away

09:05.586 --> 09:08.004
Don't you know I

09:08.172 --> 09:10.090
Sit around

09:10.258 --> 09:14.553
With my head hangin' down?

09:14.720 --> 09:20.016
And l wonder who's

09:20.184 --> 09:27.816
Lovin you

09:27.984 --> 09:34.698
Ben, the two of us need look no more

09:34.865 --> 09:41.913
We both found what we were looking for

09:42.081 --> 09:46.751
With a friend to call my own

09:46.919 --> 09:50.338
I'll never be alone

09:50.506 --> 09:53.842

Dancing, dancing, dancing

10:26.876 --> 10:28.835
Don't blame it on the moonlight

10:29.003 --> 10:31.254
Don't blame it on the good times

10:31.422 --> 10:32.714
Blame it on the boogie

10:32.882 --> 10:35.050
Don't you blame it on the sunshine

10:35.217 --> 10:37.302
Don't blame it on the moonlight

10:37.470 --> 10:39.763
Don't blame it on the good times

10:39.930 --> 10:41.306
Blame it on the boogie

10:41.891 --> 10:44.100

Reaching out

12:05.850 --> 12:08.601
I touch her shoulder

12:08.769 --> 12:12.439
I'm dreaming of the street

12:12.606 --> 12:16.151
If they say, "Why? Why?"

12:16.318 --> 12:18.820
Tell 'em that is human nature

12:18.988 --> 12:22.574

She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene

13:38.234 --> 13:42.695
l said, "Don't mind
But what do you mean, l am the one?"

13:43.656 --> 13:46.825

Gotta be mine

13:54.792 --> 13:57.126
'Cause you're so fine

13:59.171 --> 14:02.632
She looks so great
Every time I see her face

14:02.800 --> 14:04.843
She put me in a state

14:05.761 --> 14:07.095
A state of shock

14:09.431 --> 14:10.723
We're doin' it

14:13.352 --> 14:14.394
Come on, baby

14:14.812 --> 14:17.939
We are the world

14:18.107 --> 14:19.774
We are the children

14:19.942 --> 14:21.442
Our children

14:21.610 --> 14:24.279
We are the ones who make a brighter day

14:24.446 --> 14:28.032
So let's start giving

14:28.200 --> 14:31.452
There's a choice we're making

14:31.954 --> 14:34.956
We're saving our own lives

14:35.249 --> 14:37.542
It's true we'll make a better day

14:37.710 --> 14:40.503
Just you and me

14:41.422 --> 14:44.757
You knock me off of my feet now, baby

14:44.925 --> 14:46.676
Whoo!

Ooh!

You really turn me on

15:44.610 --> 15:46.694
You knock me off my feet

15:48.864 --> 15:51.240
My lonely days are gone

16:07.591 --> 16:09.258
You'll never make me stay

16:09.426 --> 16:11.094
So take your weight off of me

16:11.261 --> 16:13.012
I know your every move

16:13.180 --> 16:14.722
So won't you just let me be?

16:14.890 --> 16:16.641
l've been here times before

16:16.809 --> 16:18.393
But l was too blind to see

16:18.560 --> 16:20.228
That you seduce every man

16:20.396 --> 16:21.896
This time you won't seduce me

16:22.064 --> 16:23.690
She's saying, "That's okay

16:23.857 --> 16:25.733
Hey, baby, do as you please

16:25.901 --> 16:27.568
I have the stuff that you want

16:27.736 --> 16:29.404
I am the thing that you need"

16:29.571 --> 16:31.239
She looked me deep in the eyes

16:31.407 --> 16:32.949
She's touchin' me so to start

16:33.117 --> 16:34.701
She says, "There's no turning back"

16:34.868 --> 16:36.703
She's got me in her heart

16:36.870 --> 16:47.130
Dirty Diana, no

16:47.756 --> 16:50.008
Dirty Diana

16:51.593 --> 17:04.230
Diana

17:43.645 --> 17:44.687

18:31.944 --> 18:33.361
And to me that's really true

18:33.529 --> 18:35.446
But, my friend, you have seen nothing

21:04.388 --> 21:06.472
So that's the way it goes down, huh?

21:40.924 --> 21:43.551
Good afternoon, and welcome to our studio tour.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.594
I must ask you that no photos be taken...

21:45.762 --> 21:48.431
...and please do not feed the performers.
Thank you.

21:49.808 --> 21:52.351
-ls Bubbles in my trailer?
-Yes, sir.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.145
What is he wearing?

21:54.313 --> 21:56.897
He's wearing a Prince T-shirt
and red sneakers.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.065
Prince T-shirt?

21:58.233 --> 22:00.901
While on the tour, please do not startle the performers...

22:01.069 --> 22:04.071
...as that jarring can disturb
their breeding habits. Ha, ha. Heh.

22:04.239 --> 22:05.448
Little studio humor there.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.117
Have you seen
any famous people, Timmy?

22:08.285 --> 22:09.910
No, not yet, Grammy.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.039
Can somebody get me
a banana-cream pie after lunch?

22:13.206 --> 22:14.248
What if they're out?

22:14.416 --> 22:17.168
- Can they make me one?
- Consider it done, MJ.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.962
- What's with all the smoke?
- Movie stuff, sir.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.094
Oh, look, Grammy, it's....

22:29.931 --> 22:31.265
It's-- It's--

22:33.727 --> 22:38.314
-Mantovani?
-No, Michael Jackson!

22:38.482 --> 22:40.441
Michael Jackson?

22:57.292 --> 22:58.626
Excuse me.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.726
Land of the free.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.855
Home of the weird.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.822
Wonder if they caught him.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.199
-Which way did they go?
- l don't know.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.660
Look, Biff, there he is.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.955
Hey, buddy, how about an autograph?

23:37.332 --> 23:39.708
Would you autograph my tummy?

23:41.253 --> 23:43.671
What's the matter, you got no pen?

23:45.841 --> 23:47.883
Let's get him.

23:48.844 --> 23:52.346
Come on, buddy,
just one little autograph.

23:53.014 --> 23:54.348
Come on!

23:56.685 --> 23:57.852
Hey.

24:16.872 --> 24:21.375
Draw, you tin-horned, lily-livered,
side-winding snail!

24:22.919 --> 24:28.424
You hairball! l'll never finish this movie!
Who let him in? lsn't anybody in charge?

24:28.592 --> 24:30.718
Don't you know anything
about show business?

24:30.886 --> 24:33.762
-l'm sorry.
-My producer is doing this to me, isn't he?

24:33.930 --> 24:38.058
I ask for a bad guy
and he gives me Michael Jackson.

24:38.226 --> 24:40.269
-l can't take it anymore! l quit!

24:40.437 --> 24:45.065
Peckerwood, you're gonna
ruin my career. l'll show you bad.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.068
I'm sorry. Ha, ha. l gotta go.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.072
Let's get the varmint!

25:00.916 --> 25:02.917
I love you, Michael!

25:04.252 --> 25:05.628
There he goes.

25:12.928 --> 25:17.598
l been waiting forever to get a shot
at this guy. He's tough to shoot.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.896
-Hey, songbird!
- That's him.

25:24.064 --> 25:27.733
I've had enough of seeing you on my set.

25:33.323 --> 25:37.117
- l think he's in there.
- Wait a minute, let me get around.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.620
I got my microphone.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.291
I can hear him. I can hear him.

25:46.586 --> 25:49.129
I hear him. l hear him in there.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.926
lt's awful quiet in there.
Just hear him breathing.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.554
The door's opening. Set your focus.

25:58.807 --> 26:02.017
lt's just a stupid rabbit.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.937
- We want Mike.
- lt's a stupid rabbit.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.439
- Get out of the way, rabbit.
- Get out of there.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.316
He must be hiding.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.281
Come on out!

26:17.659 --> 26:20.369
Look over there.
Look at that bunny.

26:22.205 --> 26:23.497
Bag that bunny.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.005
Oh! lt's him!

27:01.453 --> 27:03.537
l'm headed for the border

27:03.872 --> 27:05.456
It's on my mind

27:06.166 --> 27:07.583
And nothing really matters

27:08.627 --> 27:10.544
I got to be on time

27:11.046 --> 27:12.588
Look in the view mirror

27:12.756 --> 27:14.965
Is he hot on my tracks?

27:15.717 --> 27:16.842
Is he getting nearer?

27:17.010 --> 27:18.052
Yo.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.095
I feel some heat is on my back

27:20.597 --> 27:22.848
Speed demon

27:23.016 --> 27:25.225
Speedin' on the freeway

I'm stoppin' at nothing

27:35.111 --> 27:36.612
Speed demon

27:37.572 --> 27:39.907
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

27:46.706 --> 27:48.874

28:19.114 --> 28:22.199
Speed demon
You're the very same one

28:22.367 --> 28:24.618
Who said, "The future's in your hands

28:24.786 --> 28:28.372
The life you save
Could be your own"

28:28.581 --> 28:32.167
You preachin' 'bout my life
Like you're the law

28:32.335 --> 28:34.586
Gonna live each day and hour

28:34.754 --> 28:37.798
Like for me there's no tomorrow

28:40.051 --> 28:46.056
Go!

28:46.850 --> 28:47.891
Ow!

Spike. He was just here--

32:03.129 --> 32:05.297
I need your autograph right here.

32:55.515 --> 32:58.725
I don't care what you talkin' 'bout, baby

32:58.893 --> 33:01.603
I don't care what you think

33:02.814 --> 33:06.024
Don't you come walkin'
Beggin' back, mama

33:06.734 --> 33:09.236
I don't care anyway

33:10.571 --> 33:13.991
Time after time l gave you
All of my money

33:14.409 --> 33:16.952
No excuses to make

33:18.287 --> 33:21.581
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb, baby

33:22.208 --> 33:24.918
All is going my way

33:25.086 --> 33:26.962
'Cause there's a time when you're right

33:27.130 --> 33:28.880
And you know you must fight

33:29.048 --> 33:30.882
Who's laughing, baby?

33:31.426 --> 33:32.759
Don't you know?

33:32.927 --> 33:34.720
And there's the choice that we make

33:34.887 --> 33:36.638
And this choice you will take

33:36.806 --> 33:39.224
Who's laughing, baby?

33:39.392 --> 33:41.309
So just leave me alone

Leave me alone

33:53.990 --> 33:57.325
Stop it
Just stop doggin' me around

34:04.959 --> 34:08.628
There was a time I used to say
"Girl, I need you"

34:08.795 --> 34:11.465
But who is sorry now?

34:12.675 --> 34:16.428
You really hurt
You used to take and deceive me

34:16.596 --> 34:19.056
Now who is sorry now?

34:20.516 --> 34:24.226
You got a way of making me
Feel so sorry

34:24.395 --> 34:26.813
I found out right away

34:28.190 --> 34:31.902
Don't you come walkin', beggin'
I ain't lovin' you

34:32.070 --> 34:35.322
Don't you get in my way

34:35.489 --> 34:37.324
'Cause there's a time when you're right

34:37.492 --> 34:38.699
And you know you must fight

34:38.868 --> 34:40.659

And there's the choice that we make

34:44.831 --> 34:46.500
And this choice you will take

34:46.667 --> 34:49.002
Who's laughing, baby?

34:49.170 --> 34:51.129
So just leave me alone

34:51.297 --> 34:54.007
Leave me alone, leave me alone

34:54.175 --> 34:57.969
Leave me alone

34:58.137 --> 35:01.765
-Leave me alone

35:01.933 --> 35:03.683
Leave me alone

35:03.851 --> 35:07.687
Stop it
Just stop doggin' me around

35:37.468 --> 35:40.971
There's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight

35:41.139 --> 35:43.140
Who's laughing, baby?

35:43.307 --> 35:45.225
Don't you know?

35:45.393 --> 35:48.520
There's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take

35:48.688 --> 35:51.231
Who's laughing, baby?

35:51.399 --> 35:53.275
So just leave me alone

35:56.362 --> 36:00.073
Leave me alone

36:05.955 --> 36:08.707
Stop it
Just stop doggin' me

36:11.919 --> 36:15.505
Leave me alone

36:15.673 --> 36:19.467
-Leave me alone

What are you stopping for?

38:00.736 --> 38:04.572
-That star over there.
-So what? Keep moving.

38:04.740 --> 38:07.033
Maybe that's his lucky star.

38:07.201 --> 38:11.288
-He needs one.
-Quit worrying, Katie. Come on.

38:11.455 --> 38:15.333

39:09.597 --> 39:15.352
Michael!

39:34.121 --> 39:35.622
Katie, come on.

39:46.425 --> 39:48.635
It's about time you threw it to me.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.136
Oh, yeah?

39:56.227 --> 39:57.977
Katie.

40:04.151 --> 40:05.485
Wait.

40:05.861 --> 40:08.196

40:11.409 --> 40:13.535
Katie, let's go. Come on.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.373
Hurry up. Come on.

40:20.626 --> 40:23.920
-Michael, where'd he go?
-He went in the woods over here.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.845
-Skipper!
-Skipper!

40:42.523 --> 40:44.691
Skipper!

40:49.530 --> 40:51.781
Skipper!

41:04.712 --> 41:09.174
Oh, my God. Look at this.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.188
I don't like spiders.

41:24.231 --> 41:25.857
Wait a minute.

41:35.534 --> 41:38.411
-No, Michael.
-Katie.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.166
Katie, it's okay.

42:29.296 --> 42:31.339
You gotta be real quiet.

42:40.641 --> 42:43.685
- Okay, let's see.
- Be real quiet, okay?

42:43.852 --> 42:45.478
Europe, Asia.

42:47.356 --> 42:51.651
I got Miami, l got New York.
I got cocaine, I got crack.

42:51.819 --> 42:55.572
I got Los Angeles, l got San Francisco.
I got heroin, l got speed.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.164
You guys gotta get the middle
of this country.

43:05.332 --> 43:07.333
Get in the middle of the country.

43:07.501 --> 43:09.335
Stop those kids from praying in school.

43:09.503 --> 43:13.548
First, I want you to hang around
by playgrounds, hang out in schoolyards.

43:13.716 --> 43:15.592
You gotta remember,
a younger customer...

43:15.759 --> 43:19.012
...always turns into a loyal customer.
Remember that. Remember that!

43:19.722 --> 43:21.306
He can't be doing that.

43:21.473 --> 43:24.309
Every kid in this whole world
will take drugs because of me.

43:24.476 --> 43:26.519
I want everybody to know. Everybody.

43:26.687 --> 43:31.399
My name is gonna be in the history books.
They better spell my name right.

43:31.567 --> 43:35.028
L-l-D-E-O. So simple.

43:35.696 --> 43:39.407
Frankie Lideo. Very easy.

43:39.575 --> 43:42.535
Bugs and drugs. Bugs and drugs.

43:42.703 --> 43:47.999
Smooth operation, that's what l got.
Smooth operation.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.709
What?

43:58.552 --> 44:04.682
There! There! There!

44:46.517 --> 44:50.353
That was good. That was just great.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.732
Okay, let's sweep him up now. Come on.

44:57.277 --> 44:58.861
Where is he?

45:03.367 --> 45:05.868
-Michael.
-There! Come on, get him!

45:06.036 --> 45:11.165
Kill him! Kill him! Move!
Let's see how cool he is now!

45:21.468 --> 45:25.888
Now, let's go! Move it! Move it!
Different direction.

45:26.056 --> 45:29.934
Split up. Split up, all of a sudden.
Cover everything.

45:30.477 --> 45:36.065
Come on. Come on. Will you hurry up?
Precious little brat.

45:50.289 --> 45:51.330
Michael!

45:57.671 --> 45:58.713
Michael!

46:07.556 --> 46:09.182
Cover everything. Cover everything.

46:12.060 --> 46:15.521
I want reports. l'm not
hearing anything back to me.

46:23.447 --> 46:25.531
Block off the streets. Block them off.

46:25.699 --> 46:29.202
Double back. Keep moving around,
you'll trap him that way.

46:34.708 --> 46:38.586
Come on, move it, move it.
I'm not hearing any reports back here!

46:42.424 --> 46:44.592
Don't let him get away.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.886
Split up! Get your men all over!

46:51.225 --> 46:53.392
Block off the streets. You'll get him.

46:57.397 --> 47:01.901
Block off tunnels, he's a rat.
Have to trap a rat.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.739
Trap a rat!

47:08.158 --> 47:10.201
Shoot anything that moves!

47:12.996 --> 47:16.290
What's that? Did you get him?
I heard gunfire. Did you get him?

47:20.963 --> 47:23.297
I want tunnels blocked off. Trap him.

47:30.931 --> 47:32.515
Circle everything.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.601
Everything in circles!

48:15.642 --> 48:20.646
Come on. He went right through this area.
Scour those buildings. Get him out.

48:20.814 --> 48:25.484
We've got him somewhere around here.
He's gotta be here, he didn't get out.

48:25.652 --> 48:27.153
Move! Move it!

48:29.156 --> 48:33.075
Cover that side. All right! All right!
Bring in the artillery!

48:33.243 --> 48:37.705
I want everybody here in this place.
Try out all the new hardware on him.

48:37.873 --> 48:43.336
I want this one messy.
Turn him into a stain on the concrete!

48:43.503 --> 48:47.924
And look for that little cockroach too.
She's around here somewhere.

49:13.033 --> 49:14.700
Give me that.

49:31.426 --> 49:35.930
There he is. Hold it. Hey. Hold it.

49:37.307 --> 49:38.891
He's not going anywhere.

49:43.397 --> 49:47.566
Now, there's no way out of there.
Don't screw it up.

49:57.911 --> 49:59.453
Come on, let's go!

50:13.051 --> 50:14.343
All right, come on! Come on!

50:14.511 --> 50:16.846
What are you waiting for?
It's only one guy.

50:32.320 --> 50:36.824
All right, come on. lt's a car, that's all it is.
Get out of the way!

50:38.160 --> 50:41.370
What are you waiting for? Fire!

50:52.632 --> 50:56.802
What the hell was that? What is it?

50:57.304 --> 50:59.805
Get him! Go get him!

51:03.894 --> 51:05.770
Get him! Come on, get him!

51:26.124 --> 51:28.626
- Michael?
-Katie, are you okay?

51:29.628 --> 51:31.754
-Michael got away.
-No way.

51:31.922 --> 51:35.341
-He told us to meet him here, right?
-Yeah.

51:35.509 --> 51:37.635
This place?

51:52.442 --> 51:57.530
Nobody's been here for years.
It's kind of spooky.

52:07.791 --> 52:08.958
Huh?

52:09.459 --> 52:13.420
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

52:41.658 --> 52:44.243
I think maybe we came to the wrong place.

52:47.914 --> 52:50.082
It says Club 30's.

52:50.250 --> 52:53.419
Hey, you guys, something's coming.

52:57.841 --> 53:01.677
- You scare everybody!
- Shut up.

53:11.271 --> 53:14.315
- So, what did you see? Come on.
-This isn't good.

53:14.608 --> 53:17.526
Hello, is anybody there? Hello?

53:17.694 --> 53:20.696
Man, are you okay? Come on.
Tell us what you saw.

53:20.864 --> 53:24.074
- Michael.
- So?

54:22.592 --> 54:23.634
Ow!

54:43.530 --> 54:47.449
As he came into the window
lt was the sound of a crescendo

54:47.617 --> 54:51.036
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet

54:51.579 --> 54:55.499
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable

54:55.667 --> 54:57.084
So she ran into the bedroom

54:57.252 --> 54:59.461
She was struck down
It was her doom

54:59.629 --> 55:02.214
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?

55:02.382 --> 55:03.590

Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?

55:20.191 --> 55:22.568
There's a sign in the window
That he struck you

A crescendo, Annie

A smooth criminal

56:33.640 --> 56:35.474
So they came into the outway

56:35.642 --> 56:37.684
It was Sunday
What a black day

56:37.852 --> 56:41.063
Every time I try to find him
He's leaving no clues left behind him

56:41.856 --> 56:43.273
And they have no way of knowing

56:43.441 --> 56:45.651
Of the suspect
Or what to expect

56:46.152 --> 56:47.319
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

56:47.487 --> 56:49.655
Sounding heartbeats
Intimidations

56:49.823 --> 56:52.366
