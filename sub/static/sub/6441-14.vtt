00:15.783 --> 00:18.411
They're inside already.

00:27.161 --> 00:31.257
- I don't believe this.
- I know. Isn't it awesome? A rave in a cave.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.229
Why didn't you tell me it was here?

00:33.400 --> 00:36.233
I didn't know.
I just downloaded the directions.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.166
Clark's gonna go crazy.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.500
What is his obsession with these caves?

00:40.674 --> 00:43.074
I don't know.
I think Kyla really got to him.

00:43.244 --> 00:48.079
- I better give him call, give him a heads-up.
- These caves survived hundreds of years.

00:48.249 --> 00:51.412
I don't think a little Moby's gonna
hurt them. Okay?

00:51.585 --> 00:53.678
Let's go.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.419
Come on!

01:19.613 --> 01:21.513
Excuse me.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.910
Hey, excuse me.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.886
Can you please step off the walls.
The paintings.

01:32.359 --> 01:35.556
Pete, I really don't think
they care about the cave paintings.

01:35.729 --> 01:39.130
Yeah, but, Chloe, these
pictographs are sacred.

01:42.303 --> 01:46.501
I'm sorry, do you guys know that
the clay doesn't wash out of your clothes?

01:50.477 --> 01:52.911
Just gotta hit them where it hurts.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.859
Travis, what are you doing?

02:09.029 --> 02:12.590
Taking my shot.
I always thought you were hot.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.030
I think you're kind of wasted.

02:15.202 --> 02:18.194
No, I'm just high on life.

02:25.045 --> 02:29.243
Chloe, did I just see you making out
with your chem-lab partner?

02:33.687 --> 02:35.780
- Travis!
- Hey, get down from there!

02:46.133 --> 02:47.691
Hey, get down from there!

02:52.072 --> 02:54.165
This is hopeless.

03:13.794 --> 03:18.629
I'm invincible!

04:49.623 --> 04:51.113
Pete!

04:52.292 --> 04:53.953
What are you doing? You nuts?

04:54.127 --> 04:58.029
- Just out taking a little spin.
- Without your helmet, like a wild man.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.629
You could have hurt someone,
most likely yourself.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.167
Yeah, that's a rush.

05:06.373 --> 05:09.342
Chloe told me what happened.
Sorry I wasn't there to back you up.

05:09.509 --> 05:12.842
Hey, you're never more alive
than the moment before you die.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.310
At least Travis had that.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.513
- Hey, you feeling okay?
- I feel great.

05:19.586 --> 05:22.384
If you want to talk about what happened,
I'm here for you.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.589
Clark, all you ever do is talk.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.226
For a guy who can't get hurt,
you never take any risk.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.496
That's not true.

05:31.698 --> 05:34.223
What about with Lana?
Now that Fordman's toast...

05:42.075 --> 05:43.372
Besides, it's not that easy.

05:43.543 --> 05:46.808
Why? Because you can't share
your secret?

05:46.980 --> 05:50.279
- You shared it with me, and we're still cool.
- That's different.

05:50.450 --> 05:53.715
You're just afraid she'll shut you down.
You only go around once.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.445
Forget about the past.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.618
Focus on the future.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.558
Hey.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.222
Hey.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.389
Did you hear about Travis?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.090
Yeah, pretty sad, huh?

06:41.268 --> 06:43.998
Yeah. The police think he might
have been on something...

06:44.537 --> 06:47.131
...which is the only explanation.

06:47.307 --> 06:52.006
I mean, we always assume that we have all
the time in the world, but we never know.

06:56.449 --> 07:02.513
The school counselor told me I need to
look forward, embrace living, carpe diem.

07:02.689 --> 07:06.716
At first I thought it sounded corny,
but the more I think about it, she's right.

07:06.893 --> 07:09.691
You know, I just don't want to be
a spectator in my own life.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.821
Yeah, me neither.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.027
We should go on a date, together.

07:19.205 --> 07:20.672
In the near future.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.841
Are you serious?

07:25.011 --> 07:26.603
I was.

07:28.315 --> 07:31.341
- But if you don't want to go...
- When?

07:32.452 --> 07:33.976
You mean you'll go?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.183
Yeah.

07:36.756 --> 07:39.657
I assume that was the answer
you were looking for.

07:41.528 --> 07:46.795
- Yeah. I just didn't think it'd be that easy.
- Well, all you had to do was ask.

07:49.502 --> 07:52.630
- Well, how about tomorrow?
- Sounds like fun.

07:54.307 --> 07:58.368
- Right, it's a date.
- Okay.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.368
Don't bother.
I've got a maintenance crew coming.

08:27.540 --> 08:32.068
- Lex, I didn't see you there.
- I was just checking for damage.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.912
Looks like it was quite a bash.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.441
Pete tried to break it up.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.019
Oh, I'm sure it was a noble effort...

08:42.188 --> 08:47.125
...but not many teenagers are interested
in 500-year-old cave paintings.

08:48.561 --> 08:51.758
- What's your interest, Clark?
- What do you mean?

08:51.931 --> 08:56.664
When I fired the security guard, I asked
him who else he let in these caves.

08:56.836 --> 08:59.134
He told me you were down here
almost every day.

09:00.907 --> 09:04.070
Now, you wouldn't be keeping secrets
from me, would you, Clark?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.644
Kyla gave her life for these caves.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.782
I'm doing a term paper on the drawings.

09:14.954 --> 09:18.617
"Deciphering the Mysteries
of Hieroglyphics...

09:18.792 --> 09:20.726
...by Dr. Fredrick Walden."

09:21.161 --> 09:23.755
Sounds like a real page-turner.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.825
Lex, why'd you start
the preservation project?

09:28.001 --> 09:30.162
It's not like there's big business in caves.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.301
I like a good mystery.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.707
This one promises to be fascinating.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.074
Wouldn't you agree?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.015
I better get going.

09:44.150 --> 09:48.484
I told the new security men nobody comes
down here without my permission.

09:50.657 --> 09:53.455
Nobody except for Clark Kent, of course.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.880
- Hey, I didn't hear you leave this morning.
- Oh, I had to be here first thing.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.519
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were avoiding me.

10:20.687 --> 10:23.281
Don't take it personally.
It's just how I cope.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.218
I don't want to be one of those
annoying people that says:

10:26.392 --> 10:28.724
"I'm here if you need to talk,"
but I am.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.158
I appreciate it.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.331
Listen, if you don't feel like talking...

10:33.533 --> 10:37.128
...I thought we could go to Metropolis
tomorrow and do some serious shopping.

10:37.303 --> 10:41.330
My dad said that he would join in on the
conspiracy and get us out of school early.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.643
Thanks, and I'd love to.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.678
But, you know,
I already have plans with Clark.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.913
- What kind of plans?
- Well...

10:54.721 --> 10:56.382
...he asked me out on a date.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.155
I thought you were giving up
on the mating dance.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.885
Yeah, yeah, me too.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.189
But you still said yes.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.995
- Look, if this is gonna be too weird for you...
- No.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.496
My feelings for Clark are so ancient...

11:14.674 --> 11:17.108
...they're... They're fossilized.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.747
Seriously, you should go for it.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.247
Are you sure?

11:27.253 --> 11:29.983
Lana, does it really matter how I feel?

11:32.692 --> 11:35.718
If I was in your position,
I'd do the exact same thing.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.586
Don't let me be your excuse.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.592
Okay.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.464
I'm glad we cleared the air.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.504
Me too.

11:47.674 --> 11:50.472
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.050
- Loans are expensive.
- He might get a scholarship.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.747
- That would be great, especially with...
- What's all this?

12:03.923 --> 12:08.417
We've got our finances under control.
We're trying to get a head start on college.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.961
If you ever graduate from high school.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.392
What do you mean?

12:12.565 --> 12:16.797
Principal Reynolds called this morning.
It seems you've been chronically late.

12:17.437 --> 12:21.396
He asked me if we had some emergency
here at the farm we needed your help with.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.102
I've just been spending
more time in the caves.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.745
Listen, son, we know how much
they mean to you...

12:26.913 --> 12:29.609
...but until you get on track,
I don't want you down there.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.306
- No, Dad...
- Don't argue with me.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.679
Once things get straightened out,
we can talk...

12:33.853 --> 12:37.584
...but until then I want your butt
in this house every day after school.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.088
- Give me until tomorrow.
- No.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.783
It's really important.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.560
What is it?

12:42.996 --> 12:44.725
I've got a date...

12:44.897 --> 12:46.296
...with Lana.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.761
A study date?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.230
An actual date.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.202
Jonathan, you have to let him go.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.003
Please. Come on.

12:57.176 --> 12:59.644
Promise me you'll get your
homework and chores done...

12:59.812 --> 13:02.645
...before you set
one foot outside of that door?

13:02.849 --> 13:04.373
Absolutely.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.920
- Okay.
- Thanks, Mom.

13:08.755 --> 13:11.815
When you see Pete, tell him to stop
cutting doughnuts in the field.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.754
He's scaring the cattle.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.400
I appreciate you coming on short notice,
Professor Walden.

13:25.571 --> 13:26.799
Yeah, normally I wouldn't.

13:26.973 --> 13:30.465
It's not often that I'm offered my
weekly rate for a 10-minute consultation.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.739
As I told your associate, I'm not able
to take on any new endeavors at this time.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.379
Then when can you start?

13:36.749 --> 13:38.876
- Next year.
- I was thinking more like tomorrow.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.043
I leave for Chile on Tuesday.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.755
I'm sure you can postpone your trip.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.386
It's out of the question.

13:47.727 --> 13:53.256
If you want the foremost authority
in a field, Mr. Luthor, you learn...

13:53.433 --> 13:55.799
...to wait.
- In my experience...

13:55.968 --> 13:59.495
...when you want the best,
you simply pay them what they're worth.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.969
Rich men with delusions of grandeur...

14:06.145 --> 14:08.170
...rarely sway me with a checkbook.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.054
Does this sway you?

14:24.530 --> 14:28.432
That is quite unique, I can tell you that.

14:28.935 --> 14:33.372
Doesn't appear to be Native North American
or even Mayan, for that matter.

14:37.076 --> 14:40.204
These are amazing.

14:44.951 --> 14:48.318
Hey, Chloe, have you seen Pete today?
I think he skipped school.

14:48.488 --> 14:53.221
I asked him to help me with the memorial
issue, but he totally blew me off. Why?

14:53.393 --> 14:56.521
He's just acting strange.
I think Travis' death really got to him.

14:56.696 --> 15:00.029
Well, Pete did try and save him,
but he just couldn't get there in time.

15:00.199 --> 15:04.067
- Maybe, you know, he feels guilty.
- Definitely isn't acting that way.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.272
Different people deal with grief
in different ways.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.808
Any big plans for the weekend?

15:19.318 --> 15:21.582
Do you know if they found drugs
in Travis' system?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.517
The autopsy report was inconclusive.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.919
They found a small puncture wound
on his neck...

15:26.092 --> 15:28.253
...and his adrenal gland was
unusually enlarged.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.054
Adrenaline gives you a rush.
Maybe that's why he jumped.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.822
Yeah, but he wasn't the only one.

15:32.999 --> 15:36.366
Two others at the rave, one from
Grandville, the other from Smallville...

15:36.536 --> 15:39.869
...turned up dead. One took
a swan dive into an empty pool...

15:40.039 --> 15:42.371
...and the other wrapped
his Corolla around a tree.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.970
Same puncture wound...

15:46.145 --> 15:49.546
...same enlarged adrenal gland
and same extreme behavior.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.544
Yeah, it's like they all had a death wish.

15:52.718 --> 15:55.118
- What do the police think?
- Somebody sticking them...

15:55.288 --> 15:57.347
...with a new designer drug.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.091
You think they got Pete?

16:00.259 --> 16:04.457
I don't know, but I know I need to
get him to a doctor. See you later.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.872
Yo, Clark!

16:19.045 --> 16:20.842
What's up?

16:21.948 --> 16:23.176
Pete, get down from there.

16:24.183 --> 16:26.310
Pete, I have to get you to the hospital.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.351
Something happened to you at the rave.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.157
Sure, man, I'll be right there.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.220
No!

16:42.902 --> 16:44.665
You all right? You okay?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.065
Oh, yeah!

16:46.672 --> 16:48.902
That was amazing! Let's do it again.

16:49.075 --> 16:51.305
- I'm getting you to a doctor.
- No! I feel great!

16:51.477 --> 16:53.502
- You're coming with me.
- No, I'm not.

16:53.679 --> 16:58.810
And if you take one more step,
I'm gonna tell all these people your secret!

16:59.285 --> 17:01.150
I dare you.

17:01.988 --> 17:05.788
He's an alien! He's an alien!
I'm not lying! He's an alien!

17:05.958 --> 17:07.949
I'm telling the truth!

17:08.227 --> 17:11.526
Look out, my best friend's an alien!

17:18.169 --> 17:20.467
Whatever happened to Pete
started in this cave.

17:20.637 --> 17:23.664
Have you gotten him to a doctor,
or is he as needle-phobic as you?

17:23.842 --> 17:28.301
I haven't been able to find him. My dad
called the Rosses. They haven't seen him.

17:28.646 --> 17:30.443
So, what exactly are we looking for?

17:30.615 --> 17:31.912
I don't know.

17:32.083 --> 17:36.417
A certain reporter friend of mine
always said to explore all options.

17:36.821 --> 17:39.119
In that case, I'll look over here.

17:39.290 --> 17:43.317
Okay. I'll check out the other chamber.

18:05.783 --> 18:07.216
Hey!

18:08.286 --> 18:12.017
This cave is off-limits. Why don't you find
somewhere else to make out?

18:13.992 --> 18:15.857
You all right?

18:17.228 --> 18:18.456
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:20.398 --> 18:21.797
As for your snide remark...

18:21.966 --> 18:25.333
...people haven't made out
in this cave since the 20th century.

18:26.504 --> 18:27.903
Now, back off.

18:31.209 --> 18:33.370
Hey, you're Fredrick Walden, the linguist.

18:33.544 --> 18:36.138
- You wrote that book.
- I've written many books.

18:36.547 --> 18:39.948
- Did Lex Luthor hire you?
- Thanks to you, Clark.

18:40.118 --> 18:43.212
I'm counting on Professor Walden
to translate these pictographs.

18:43.388 --> 18:47.518
- It'll help the preservation effort.
- Rule one, no guided tours.

18:47.692 --> 18:50.786
They're friends of mine.
I didn't realize you'd accepted my offer.

18:50.962 --> 18:53.430
I have, but we do things on my terms.

18:53.598 --> 18:55.566
I don't allow anybody except for staff.

18:55.733 --> 18:58.167
With all due respect, professor,
I found the caves.

18:58.336 --> 19:00.668
I don't care if you discovered
the Shroud of Turin.

19:00.838 --> 19:04.239
If you're unhappy with my method,
I can take the first flight to Chile.

19:06.644 --> 19:08.339
- I'm sorry.
- Lex, you can't do this.

19:08.513 --> 19:12.347
He's one of the most renowned linguists
in the world. If that's the way he works...

19:12.517 --> 19:14.212
...we have to respect that.

19:15.219 --> 19:16.481
Hey!

19:16.654 --> 19:18.417
You get down from there.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.353
Come on, Chloe, let's go.

19:25.196 --> 19:27.460
What are you smiling at?
I want those photographs.

19:27.632 --> 19:29.930
- Take your own.
- I'm serious, young lady.

19:30.101 --> 19:33.662
You're the cunning linguist.
Why don't you translate this:

19:33.871 --> 19:37.807
Kiss my ass.

20:03.968 --> 20:05.993
Why did your dad call my parents?

20:07.338 --> 20:09.465
- Pete, calm down.
- "Pete, calm down."

20:09.640 --> 20:11.267
I thought you were my friend.

20:11.442 --> 20:12.670
Pete, I think you're sick.

20:12.844 --> 20:16.940
For a guy who likes privacy, you sure stick
your nose in other people's business.

20:25.823 --> 20:28.348
- You x-raying me?
- There's something in you.

20:28.526 --> 20:30.653
You need to come
to the medical center with me.

20:30.828 --> 20:32.261
Try and touch me, you freak.

20:32.430 --> 20:34.159
You're coming with me!

20:34.332 --> 20:37.358
You think because you have those powers,
you always get your way.

20:37.535 --> 20:39.696
News flash, I know your weakness.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.505
Feels good, doesn't it?

20:50.481 --> 20:52.176
Pete...

20:52.350 --> 20:53.647
...how could you do this?

20:53.818 --> 20:56.048
Back off, if you know
what's good for you.

20:59.957 --> 21:01.390
Pete, come back!

21:02.493 --> 21:04.051
I'm serious!

21:04.228 --> 21:07.664
Come near me again, and I'll start
selling tickets to your storm cellar.

21:19.844 --> 21:22.745
Run the new pigment sample
with the base-line chromatography.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.745
Yes, doctor.

21:27.652 --> 21:31.247
- I came as soon as I got your message.
- You need to see it with your own eyes.

21:31.422 --> 21:33.982
We think it's some kind of parasite.

21:36.561 --> 21:39.428
Found a nest of them
behind one of the glyphs.

21:39.997 --> 21:41.794
It gets better.

21:49.207 --> 21:51.266
- You know what it says?
- Not yet.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.734
My people are working on it right now.

21:53.911 --> 21:57.369
But I think it's meant
as some kind of warning against intruders.

21:59.117 --> 22:01.950
- Are they poisonous?
- I wasn't gonna take any chances.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.088
We destroyed the nest
with liquid nitrogen.

22:04.255 --> 22:07.349
I wonder if the Kawatche tribe put
them here to protect the drawings.

22:07.525 --> 22:09.459
Somebody did.

22:09.961 --> 22:12.657
Do you have any live specimens left?

22:13.865 --> 22:17.301
I want them sent to
Cadmus Labs in Metropolis.

22:21.706 --> 22:23.799
Hey, Chloe, I need the...

22:27.612 --> 22:29.910
Don't worry, Clark. We're done.

22:36.754 --> 22:38.085
Can I get your number?

22:38.256 --> 22:40.884
Why? The thrill is gone.

22:48.065 --> 22:50.499
- Who was that?
- I don't know. I met him in the hall.

22:50.668 --> 22:55.162
Thought he was cute. Asked him if he
wanted to do some investigative reporting.

22:56.174 --> 22:57.971
Chloe, what's going on? Are you okay?

22:58.142 --> 23:02.169
Oh, Clark, don't tell me you're jealous.
Thought you only had eyes for Lana.

23:03.281 --> 23:05.010
Oh, I heard about your date...

23:06.017 --> 23:09.077
...but, of course, it's not like
you have the guts to tell me.

23:09.487 --> 23:10.852
Is that what this is about?

23:11.022 --> 23:12.751
Don't flatter yourself, Clark.

23:12.924 --> 23:16.553
I just wanted to explore my options,
take a risk.

23:16.928 --> 23:19.624
So, what can I do for you?

23:22.266 --> 23:25.827
Remember you said there was this
weird hole in the back of Travis' neck?

23:26.003 --> 23:27.994
I was wondering if it could be from...

23:28.172 --> 23:29.469
...some kind of parasite.

23:32.510 --> 23:35.377
What orifice did you pull that one from?

23:36.914 --> 23:39.883
- That's kind of harsh, isn't it?
- Come on, Clark.

23:40.051 --> 23:43.953
It's not like you hit the mute button
on your skepticism when I take a logic leap.

23:44.121 --> 23:45.611
It's just a hunch.

23:45.790 --> 23:47.621
Travis' adrenal gland was abnormal.

23:47.792 --> 23:51.353
Maybe the parasite was feeding off
his adrenaline, making him want more.

23:52.029 --> 23:55.396
Don't you think they would have found
the parasite during the autopsy?

23:55.566 --> 23:58.330
Not if it burrowed
out of that hole after he died.

23:58.569 --> 24:00.662
All right, so, what do you need me for?

24:00.838 --> 24:04.171
I can't get within 50 feet of Pete.
I figured you could talk to him.

24:07.044 --> 24:09.842
Chloe, I'm sorry you're angry with me
about this date.

24:10.014 --> 24:12.073
I thought we knew where we stood.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.411
But the only thing I can think
about is Pete.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.085
Sure, Clark.

24:18.189 --> 24:20.054
I'll do it for you.

24:20.958 --> 24:23.483
Just get him to your house.
I'll see you there.

24:25.229 --> 24:27.254
It's a date.

24:44.215 --> 24:47.446
Hey, you're early.
Wasn't expecting you for another hour.

24:47.718 --> 24:50.846
Not that I mind.
I'm really excited about our date.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.918
So was I.

24:53.524 --> 24:55.617
Why are you speaking in the past tense?

24:57.128 --> 24:59.187
Lana, I can't go out with you tonight.

24:59.897 --> 25:04.197
If it wasn't a life-and-death situation,
I wouldn't break this date for anything.

25:05.036 --> 25:06.264
What's going on?

25:06.971 --> 25:11.567
It's Pete. Something happened to him. If
I don't get him to the hospital, he could die.

25:12.810 --> 25:16.041
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- Chloe and I have it covered.

25:16.213 --> 25:17.441
Okay.

25:17.615 --> 25:21.915
I've done this to you in the past, and
I wanted you to have a reason this time.

25:23.788 --> 25:25.722
It's not a problem.

25:25.890 --> 25:28.256
We've waited this long,
what's another day?

25:35.199 --> 25:37.633
Hey, lovebirds, look who I found.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.963
Chloe, we were supposed
to meet at your house.

25:41.238 --> 25:45.072
- Pete, how are you feeling?
- Awesome. I've never felt better in my life.

25:45.976 --> 25:48.171
It sounded like you were
on your deathbed.

25:48.479 --> 25:49.969
And you believed him?

25:50.147 --> 25:52.172
Haven't you learned by now?

25:52.350 --> 25:55.581
That's just Clark being Clark.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.020
I guess not.

26:07.765 --> 26:09.357
Pete, I need to get you help.

26:09.533 --> 26:12.900
Whoa, Clark,
I know you're worried about me.

26:13.070 --> 26:16.870
You're my boy. You always have been,
but I figured it out.

26:17.041 --> 26:19.373
In your world, green means stop.

26:19.543 --> 26:22.444
And red, red means go.

26:36.227 --> 26:37.922
We're gonna have some fun now.

26:38.095 --> 26:39.995
- Where are your parents?
- Looking for you.

26:40.164 --> 26:41.756
- So, what's the plan?
- I don't know.

26:41.932 --> 26:45.265
I was thinking maybe we go down
to Saunder's Gorge and jump the quarry.

26:45.436 --> 26:47.700
- Lf we miss, Clark can catch us.
- Let's do it.

26:47.872 --> 26:49.499
Yeah, right.

26:49.673 --> 26:51.573
I'm serious.

26:52.843 --> 26:54.208
Can we tell her?

26:54.612 --> 26:56.580
I'm surprised she hasn't figured it out.

26:57.148 --> 26:58.376
Figured out what?

27:00.184 --> 27:03.551
Hey, Pete, you do the honors?

27:04.155 --> 27:05.417
With pleasure.

27:12.196 --> 27:16.360
It gets better.
Clark, it's a little dark in here.

27:24.275 --> 27:27.210
- How did you...?
- Do that?

27:28.279 --> 27:30.076
What are you?

27:30.247 --> 27:32.215
Let's just say I'm not from around here.

27:37.021 --> 27:39.489
- You knew about this?
- He's my brother...

27:39.657 --> 27:40.885
...from another planet.

27:43.260 --> 27:45.751
You should see the look
on your face right now.

27:46.530 --> 27:48.225
Oh, my God.

27:48.399 --> 27:50.299
This is so cool.

27:53.103 --> 27:54.900
Can you fly?

27:55.105 --> 27:56.436
Whoa, wait a minute.

27:56.607 --> 27:59.235
I may be an alien, but I'm not a cartoon.

28:00.010 --> 28:02.137
So if I fall...

28:05.616 --> 28:07.641
...would you catch me?

28:09.053 --> 28:10.816
Go for it.

28:21.499 --> 28:23.694
My own personal superhero.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.803
I always knew there was something
special about you, Clark Kent.

28:26.971 --> 28:29.462
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

28:31.308 --> 28:32.707
You are.

28:33.577 --> 28:35.408
- Does he know?
- No.

28:35.579 --> 28:38.980
I tell people who don't go around
stabbing me in the back and lying to me.

28:39.683 --> 28:41.981
Clark, can I have a word with you?

28:42.419 --> 28:44.512
- Alone?
- I'm busy.

28:44.688 --> 28:46.713
Don't even worry about it, Clark.

28:47.424 --> 28:48.948
It's cool.

28:50.928 --> 28:53.021
We'll meet you in the car.

28:56.967 --> 28:58.798
You know, I always wondered...

28:58.969 --> 29:02.302
...for a boy who has
all the money in the world...

29:02.473 --> 29:04.964
...you'd think he could afford
a good toupee.

29:15.252 --> 29:17.117
What's going on, Clark?

29:17.421 --> 29:19.946
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were on something.

29:20.124 --> 29:23.582
We're just having a good time,
not that it's any of your business.

29:23.761 --> 29:27.492
Ever heard of a phone? You come barging in
like you own the place. It's really...

29:27.665 --> 29:31.157
I came here to tell you, Clark,
I talked to Walden.

29:31.769 --> 29:34.237
- He won't budge.
- Or you don't want me in the cave?

29:34.805 --> 29:36.602
Don't lie to me. You're Lex Luthor.

29:36.774 --> 29:39.971
You pay a guy, he does what you tell him.
Isn't that the way it works?

29:40.144 --> 29:43.341
- Clark...
- I'm gonna go in those caves when I please.

29:45.516 --> 29:47.040
I dare you to stop me.

29:47.217 --> 29:48.844
Is this really about a term paper?

29:50.721 --> 29:52.552
You'd love to know, wouldn't you?

29:54.458 --> 29:57.018
I'm gonna go. So are you.

29:57.394 --> 30:00.886
I like to see you standing up for yourself,
Clark, I really do.

30:02.366 --> 30:04.231
Be careful not to cross the line.

30:04.835 --> 30:06.666
Is that a threat?

30:07.605 --> 30:10.597
- Just giving you friendly advice.
- Let me give you some back.

30:10.774 --> 30:13.675
If you know what's good for you,
stay the hell away from me.

30:24.021 --> 30:27.252
- Come on, Pete, go faster.
- I'm driving, I'm driving.

30:31.395 --> 30:34.956
Hey, Clark, what other
superpowers you got?

30:35.132 --> 30:37.225
Why don't you come back here
and find out.

30:37.501 --> 30:39.366
Hey, hey, hey, this isn't a pimp-mobile.

30:39.837 --> 30:44.968
- Dang, Chloe, never knew you had all that.
- Just keep your eyes on the road, Pete.

30:48.679 --> 30:51.113
Guys, get a room.

30:51.281 --> 30:53.511
Where's the fun in that, Pete?

30:55.419 --> 30:58.286
I want you to make a quick
pit stop before we go to the gorge.

30:58.555 --> 31:00.921
- Where?
- The Talon.

31:01.425 --> 31:02.892
Oh, man.

31:07.731 --> 31:08.993
Excuse me.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.994
Hello!

31:12.970 --> 31:15.097
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

31:16.240 --> 31:19.505
- We're not going anywhere.
- Yeah, why don't you go get your manager.

31:24.715 --> 31:26.580
So, what do you wanna do next?

31:27.151 --> 31:30.211
- How about we play a game of strip poker?
- We don't have any cards.

31:30.387 --> 31:31.718
Sure we do.

31:38.462 --> 31:39.895
Full house.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.089
Royal flush.

32:05.122 --> 32:07.420
Chloe, we can't do this.

32:07.591 --> 32:10.788
What...? What happened?
Why the sudden Jekyll and Hyde?

32:12.262 --> 32:14.355
Don't tell me you're thinking about Lana.

32:14.531 --> 32:16.055
This has nothing to do with Lana.

32:17.167 --> 32:19.465
You don't have any real feelings for me,
do you?

32:19.770 --> 32:22.136
Every time we hang out,
it's just to get answers.

32:22.539 --> 32:25.736
Chloe, why don't you research this
or why don't you look up that?

32:25.909 --> 32:29.902
I'm nothing more to you than your own
personal search engine, and I'm sick of it.

32:32.549 --> 32:34.517
I want you, Clark.

32:40.891 --> 32:44.588
- Chloe, you have the parasite.
- Well, I love the way I feel.

32:44.762 --> 32:46.855
So maybe this is exactly what I need...

32:47.030 --> 32:52.491
...to spend more time actually living life
and less time reporting it.

32:56.473 --> 32:58.566
Lana, this is not what it looks like.

33:01.178 --> 33:04.147
Yeah, it is, Lana.
It's exactly what it looks like.

33:04.314 --> 33:07.112
Oh, and guess what,
Clark told me everything.

33:10.654 --> 33:12.849
And I mean everything.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.425
Lana, I can explain.

33:29.706 --> 33:33.005
Chloe, you don't understand.
You're not yourself. You need a doctor.

33:33.177 --> 33:35.907
What's all this doctor talk again?

33:36.079 --> 33:38.240
What happened to my little red rock?

33:40.150 --> 33:41.742
Pete, how could you do that to me?

33:41.919 --> 33:43.147
Relax, you needed it.

33:43.320 --> 33:46.289
Now, let's go jump the gorge.
You guys can suck face later.

33:46.456 --> 33:49.254
No, Pete, I'm taking you
to an emergency room.

33:50.227 --> 33:52.457
I don't care what you tell people about...

33:57.968 --> 33:59.765
How'd you do that?

34:00.103 --> 34:02.094
Clark's Achilles' heel.

34:02.573 --> 34:05.565
He may be a boy scout,
but I'm always prepared.

34:05.742 --> 34:07.175
Let's go.

34:25.094 --> 34:26.755
Lana.

34:27.598 --> 34:30.260
- Where's Chloe and Pete?
- I don't know.

34:30.434 --> 34:32.425
And to be honest, I really don't care.

34:52.054 --> 34:54.319
- Look at that drop.
- It'll be like flying.

34:54.491 --> 34:57.153
- Who needs Clark?
- Yeah, screw Clark!

35:09.740 --> 35:13.039
- We've got ignition!
- What are we waiting for? Blastoff!

35:30.928 --> 35:32.828
- That was awesome!
- One more time, Clark!

35:32.996 --> 35:35.590
- Oh, my God.
- Joy ride's over.

35:54.651 --> 35:55.879
Hey.

35:57.020 --> 35:58.317
Hey.

35:58.488 --> 36:00.115
How you feeling?

36:00.290 --> 36:02.121
Finally made the Wall of Weird.

36:03.393 --> 36:04.985
Congratulations.

36:05.162 --> 36:08.427
I heard about that thing
they extracted from me.

36:08.598 --> 36:10.190
Did they get a picture I could see?

36:10.534 --> 36:11.831
You don't need to see it.

36:12.069 --> 36:13.900
It's gross?

36:14.071 --> 36:16.335
- Pretty bad.
- How's Pete?

36:16.707 --> 36:18.299
Pete's okay. He'll be fine.

36:18.475 --> 36:20.875
Good.

36:21.044 --> 36:23.069
So, what do you remember
about what happened?

36:24.181 --> 36:26.979
Well, let's see, we were...

36:27.317 --> 36:30.081
We were in the cave
talking to that obnoxious professor...

36:30.787 --> 36:32.049
...and then...

36:32.222 --> 36:35.680
...I was coming out of surgery.
Everything else is just blank.

36:37.928 --> 36:39.759
Why? Did I miss anything exciting?

36:41.598 --> 36:42.963
No...

36:43.133 --> 36:44.600
...nothing exciting.

36:47.404 --> 36:49.201
I'm glad you're okay.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.772
Me too.

36:53.343 --> 36:55.470
I'll just come back later.

36:55.979 --> 36:59.540
It's okay, Lana. I was just leaving.

37:01.184 --> 37:03.709
- I'll catch up with you later, okay?
- Promise?

37:03.887 --> 37:05.377
Yeah.

37:12.896 --> 37:14.420
Lana, I'm sorry.

37:14.598 --> 37:19.331
I didn't come here to see you, Clark. I came
here to see my roommate. She's been ill.

37:20.570 --> 37:21.969
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:22.272 --> 37:24.536
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

37:24.708 --> 37:27.871
Not that I really remember
everything that happened...

37:28.045 --> 37:30.240
...but I have a feeling I should
be apologizing.

37:30.447 --> 37:33.575
Oh, let's just say, you weren't yourself.

37:34.818 --> 37:37.252
So I guess your date
with Clark was kind of a bust.

37:38.855 --> 37:40.550
Did I screw it up?

37:41.591 --> 37:44.617
Trust me, Clark screwed it up
all by himself.

37:44.795 --> 37:46.194
What'd he do this time?

37:47.364 --> 37:49.127
Well...

37:49.699 --> 37:51.792
...I caught him making out
with another girl.

37:53.103 --> 37:55.628
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:56.506 --> 37:58.235
Who was the girl?

38:01.578 --> 38:03.944
I didn't recognize her.

38:13.023 --> 38:16.083
Clark, are you sure that Chloe
doesn't remember anything?

38:16.293 --> 38:18.625
I can't believe Pete slipped you
a red meteor rock.

38:20.997 --> 38:23.363
It wasn't entirely his fault.

38:23.533 --> 38:25.228
Son, that's exactly the point.

38:25.402 --> 38:29.202
He knew exactly what to do to control you,
and that's what scares us.

38:29.372 --> 38:30.999
It scares me too, Mr. Kent.

38:32.676 --> 38:34.803
Pete, hi. You're out.

38:34.978 --> 38:38.778
Yeah, back to normal, whatever that is.

38:40.217 --> 38:42.378
Listen, I'm really sorry
about what happened.

38:42.552 --> 38:45.385
I don't even remember what I did.
Clark filled me in.

38:45.555 --> 38:48.991
I just want to say that if you guys
never want to speak to me again...

38:49.159 --> 38:51.559
...I'll understand.
- Pete...

38:52.529 --> 38:54.997
...we knew the risks
when Clark told you his secret.

38:55.165 --> 38:58.396
Our concern was always that it was
an unfair burden on you.

38:59.136 --> 39:02.902
And as much as we'd like
to take it off your shoulders, we can't.

39:03.073 --> 39:04.472
Besides...

39:04.641 --> 39:06.074
...everybody stumbles.

39:06.476 --> 39:09.968
The important thing is
you're safe, you're alive...

39:10.147 --> 39:12.513
...and you're still a member of this family.

39:13.183 --> 39:15.549
Whether you like it or not.

39:15.986 --> 39:17.510
Thank you.

39:24.861 --> 39:26.590
Professor.

39:27.497 --> 39:29.761
I just got off the phone
with Cadmus Labs.

39:29.933 --> 39:31.662
The dissection is done, I take it.

39:33.703 --> 39:36.763
The creature's physiology
is completely unique.

39:37.507 --> 39:40.374
Its DNA is unlike anything on this Earth.

39:40.577 --> 39:44.877
Are you suggesting that these parasites
are somehow alien in origin?

39:45.048 --> 39:47.949
I'm hoping the symbols on the walls
might answer that question.

39:48.118 --> 39:51.246
- Then I'd better get to work.
- Before I allow you to continue...

39:51.421 --> 39:54.413
...I'm afraid you're gonna have
to make a few concessions.

39:54.591 --> 39:59.051
- We've already negotiated my fee.
- This isn't about money.

39:59.229 --> 40:02.062
You're gonna give Clark Kent
unfettered access to the cave.

40:02.232 --> 40:04.860
Just what exactly is your fascination
with this boy?

40:06.870 --> 40:10.863
My instincts tell me Clark knows a lot more
about that cave than he's letting on.

40:41.004 --> 40:42.562
What's this?

40:42.739 --> 40:45.367
My pathetic attempt at an apology.

40:46.209 --> 40:48.473
I plead temporary insanity.

40:49.012 --> 40:53.005
It doesn't take a genius to see that you
and Chloe still have feelings for each other.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.312
Lana, Chloe and I are just friends.

40:55.585 --> 40:59.487
Obviously closer friends than we are.

41:01.291 --> 41:02.622
Lana, that's not true.

41:02.792 --> 41:06.319
Clark, you can't lie to me about something
I saw with my own eyes.

41:06.663 --> 41:08.688
For once, just be honest with yourself.

41:09.232 --> 41:12.861
I know why Chloe was kissing you.

41:13.036 --> 41:14.799
But why were you kissing her back?

41:20.810 --> 41:22.437
I have to lock up.

41:23.305 --> 41:29.242
