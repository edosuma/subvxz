00:02.836 --> 00:04.738
Ten people died in the Bronx
last night due to a fire

00:04.772 --> 00:08.076
that killed ten people in the
Bronx last night during a fire.

00:08.109 --> 00:11.045
Fire officials say all ten
people died due to the fire

00:11.079 --> 00:12.780
which was too hot
for their bodies.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.917
**

00:21.189 --> 00:22.890
So you banged the
old broad downstairs?

00:22.923 --> 00:24.492
No.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.360
It was her niece?

00:26.394 --> 00:28.196
You banged
a little kid?

00:28.229 --> 00:30.398
No.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.933
No, it's a grown woman.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.703
We've been dating,
we had sex for the first time.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.041
(man)
What-- why is she crying?

00:41.075 --> 00:43.944
Well, she was-- I don't know,
she doesn't speak English.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.793
So let's look at the future
of Hurricane Jasmine Forsythe.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.130
Weather guy,
what's the status now?

01:02.163 --> 01:03.931
We should expect to see
the peak of the storm

01:03.964 --> 01:05.933
here in New York
tonight or tomorrow,

01:05.966 --> 01:08.269
and it should be pretty
catastrophic.

01:08.302 --> 01:12.740
Well, how do you feel
about this broad anyway?

01:12.773 --> 01:14.041
A lot.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.376
Yeah?

01:15.409 --> 01:16.810
I don't know,
I thought everything

01:16.844 --> 01:19.046
would be okay once
we, uh, you know...

01:19.079 --> 01:20.881
got serious.

01:20.914 --> 01:25.119
Well, having sex for the first
time doesn't make it serious.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.820
That was true
in 1958.

01:26.854 --> 01:30.124
I mean...

01:30.158 --> 01:31.825
Broads are like
us now, pigs.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.827
(chuckling)

01:33.861 --> 01:36.164
I mean... you know?

01:38.666 --> 01:44.205
(church bells tolling)

01:47.708 --> 01:49.977
Hey!

01:50.010 --> 01:51.612
Amia!

01:51.645 --> 01:54.982
(bells tolling)

01:55.015 --> 01:56.417
Hey, where you going?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.451
(thunder rumbling)

01:57.485 --> 01:59.753
Amia!

01:59.787 --> 02:01.322
(thunder rumbling)

02:01.355 --> 02:02.923
Amia!

02:02.956 --> 02:04.492
Amia!

02:10.164 --> 02:11.799
(bells tolling)

02:16.036 --> 02:17.505
Amia!

03:34.615 --> 03:37.751
(exhaling)

03:44.758 --> 03:47.761
(panting)

03:50.230 --> 03:51.899
Hey...

03:51.932 --> 03:53.301
I'm...

03:56.504 --> 03:58.606
I'm sorry.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.809
I'm...

04:01.842 --> 04:03.477
(exhaling)

04:08.148 --> 04:10.484
I'm sorry, um...

04:13.987 --> 04:17.024
I don't know,
I don't know why I'm sorry.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.963
I'm not, I guess,
I guess, um...

04:25.499 --> 04:27.901
Maybe you feel
like ashamed of--

04:27.935 --> 04:32.806
(thunder rumbling)

04:32.840 --> 04:37.110
Um...

04:37.144 --> 04:39.680
I, you know--

04:39.713 --> 04:44.184
I don't, I...

04:44.217 --> 04:46.286
Maybe we're in two different
rooms or something,

04:46.320 --> 04:48.856
but I thought
that something, I--

04:52.793 --> 04:57.531
(speaking Hungarian)

04:57.565 --> 05:00.334
Um...

05:05.806 --> 05:08.208
(speaking Hungarian)

05:16.183 --> 05:19.019
(speaking Hungarian)

05:32.332 --> 05:34.034
I would pay
a million dollars

05:34.067 --> 05:37.371
to know what you're saying
right now, a million dollars.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.806
(sighing)

05:38.839 --> 05:42.376
I-- I don't know
what you're saying.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.511
And you don't know
what I--

05:43.544 --> 05:45.413
You don't know
what... this is.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.916
I don't know
what that is.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.354
Come on, come on,
let's go, let's go.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.889
Let's go.
No.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.491
Come with me.
No, no.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.226
Come with me, come with
me, come on, come on.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.728
I'm serious,
come with me.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.497
Come with me,
come on, come on.

06:03.531 --> 06:06.033
I need you to talk,
to translate, because I,

06:06.066 --> 06:07.701
I can't communicate with
her all of a sudden.

06:07.735 --> 06:08.902
She won't talk to me.

06:08.936 --> 06:13.607
(speaking Hungarian)

06:13.641 --> 06:16.243
She says she won't talk
about this with me here.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.011
Well, yeah, that's
because she's Catholic

06:18.045 --> 06:19.880
and she's ashamed that
we had sex and--

06:19.913 --> 06:21.048
Whoo!

06:21.081 --> 06:23.451
Sex and --

06:23.484 --> 06:25.352
(shouting)

06:25.385 --> 06:27.287
(dinnerware shattering)

06:27.320 --> 06:28.456
Hey!

06:28.489 --> 06:29.623
(shouting in Hungarian)

06:29.657 --> 06:30.924
We have to
talk about it!

06:30.958 --> 06:32.760
(shouting)

06:32.793 --> 06:34.194
I'm in love with-- tell
her I'm in love with her!

06:34.227 --> 06:35.395
(shouting in Hungarian)

06:35.429 --> 06:36.597
I'm in
love with you!

06:36.630 --> 06:38.031
I'm in love with you.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.701
What am I supposed
to do about it?

06:40.734 --> 06:43.471
(thunder crashing)

06:43.504 --> 06:45.305
(Emergency Alert System
blaring on TV)

06:45.338 --> 06:48.375
Jesus.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.544
We are seeing
record storm surges.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.646
Flooding is rampant in Lower
Manhattan.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.649
At this point, all
of Manhattan below 23rd Street

06:55.683 --> 06:58.986
is without electricity, traffic
lights or running water.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.722
The Mayor has issued a
mandatory evacuation order

07:01.755 --> 07:05.559
for all homes south of 23rd
Street by midnight tonight

07:05.593 --> 07:07.761
before the
expected landfall...

07:07.795 --> 07:09.162
Are you okay?

07:09.196 --> 07:11.565
My ex-wife and my kids
are downtown.

07:11.599 --> 07:15.135
Now, as you can see in this
map, everybody in this part

07:15.168 --> 07:17.170
of Western Brooklyn
is already dead.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.507
Everybody in this
part of Brooklyn

07:19.540 --> 07:21.975
will be dead
by 4:00 tomorrow.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.444
Janet, Janet,
it's Louie.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.146
Are you still in downtown?

07:26.179 --> 07:28.181
Yes, we're down town
we're at the apartment.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.818
I know, honey, I know, honey,
I'm gonna fix it-- hello?

07:30.851 --> 07:33.353
Listen to me, the Mayor is
evacuating the city.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.255
You have to get
out of there.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.591
We can't get out of here,
Louie, the lights just went off

07:37.625 --> 07:41.194
and the, and the
window just broke.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.498
Well, get back to
your room right now.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.500
Get back to your--
calm down here!

07:46.534 --> 07:49.436
I'm coming down-- Janet,
I'm coming down there.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.539
Janet, I'm coming down there.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.773
What?

07:52.806 --> 07:54.174
(Jane)
Mommy!

07:54.207 --> 07:55.375
(thunder crashing)

07:55.408 --> 07:56.944
(Janet)
Go to your room!

07:56.977 --> 07:58.445
(girls screaming)

07:58.478 --> 08:00.814
I gotta to, I gotta go,
I gotta get my kids.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.083
Bye, I gotta go, bye.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.469
Welcome to Hertz.
Can I help you?

10:16.483 --> 10:18.719

11:20.113 --> 11:22.315
Hey, Janet,
this is Louie, if--

11:22.349 --> 11:23.516
(rapping on door)

11:23.550 --> 11:26.253
Jesus!
Jesus Christ!

11:26.286 --> 11:27.487
What the hell?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.222
Hey, I'm looking
for a dog.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.590
What?

11:30.623 --> 11:32.492
I'm looking for a dog!

11:32.525 --> 11:34.061
You lost your dog?

11:34.094 --> 11:37.497
I don't have a dog, man,
I'm looking for a dog.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.400
What are you
talking about?

11:40.433 --> 11:42.402
What?!

11:42.435 --> 11:47.474
What?! I, I can't hear
you 'cause of a hurricane!

11:53.313 --> 11:55.615
(rapping on door)

11:55.648 --> 11:58.752
Get out of here!

Who is it?

12:45.698 --> 12:47.434
Janet, it's Louie!

12:47.467 --> 12:49.436
(Janet)
Hold on.
It's Louie!

12:50.971 --> 12:51.939
(Jane)
Daddy! Daddy!

12:51.972 --> 12:52.940
Thank God, you're here.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.241
Daddy.
Hi, hi.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.076
Listen, where's, where's
Patrick?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.777
He's not... here,
and then the window broke.
Okay.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.080
And then I didn't know
what we were gonna do and--

13:00.113 --> 13:01.781
It's all right, I got a car.
I didn't know what
we were gonna do!

13:01.815 --> 13:04.251
It's okay, I got
a car and we're gonna--

13:04.284 --> 13:06.486
I put them in here and I didn't
know what we were gonna do.
Janet, it's okay.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.955
I didn't know what
we were gonna do!
It's okay.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.089
I didn't know what
we were gonna do.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.123
It's okay,
it's okay.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.524
(sobbing)

13:11.558 --> 13:12.659
It's okay, come
here, it's all right.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.694

13:17.898 --> 13:19.833
It's okay.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.303
Okay, look,
look, look, listen to me.
Okay.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.704
We got a car and
we're going uptown.

13:24.737 --> 13:25.939
We're gonna get out
of here, okay?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.507
Okay.
Is it safe to leave?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.109
It's safer than
staying here, right?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.343
Okay.
We don't wanna
stay here, right?

13:30.377 --> 13:31.644
Okay.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.013
So look,
everybody's uptown.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.181
We'll try if we can get uptown.
Daddy?

13:34.214 --> 13:35.382
Shut up!
Shh, shh, shh.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.616
So we're gonna
go up--

13:36.649 --> 13:38.051
Daddy?
Shut up!

13:38.085 --> 13:40.120
I thought we were
gonna die but we didn't.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.489
That's good, right, so, let's--
let's just go, go, everybody.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.790
Get your coats, go,

17:28.615 --> 17:33.620
"I have...
bottle them for you.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.626
"I hope to some day
give them to you.

17:41.594 --> 17:47.934
"It has been beautiful and
unexpected adventure in my life

17:47.967 --> 17:55.275
"to know you and to
feel what is between us.

17:55.308 --> 18:01.414
"It's almost, and someday maybe,
could be love.

18:05.785 --> 18:11.758
"When I came here, I never
thought that I would stay.

18:11.791 --> 18:15.562
"This is not
my world.

18:15.595 --> 18:19.232
"I have a world with
my son, my family.

"I have friends and even
people who are not anything

"to do to me

"who I miss every day.

"I do not share this missing
with you or anyone.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.389
"It's mine.

18:45.725 --> 18:51.598
And yet, I have been
so grateful that we had..."

18:51.631 --> 18:53.633
Uh, um...

18:53.666 --> 18:57.036
(speaking Hungarian)

18:57.069 --> 19:01.808
Um... it's like, um,
peaceful happiness?

19:01.841 --> 19:04.744
Yes, a peaceful happiness.

19:07.314 --> 19:10.717
"But let's really
say the truth.

19:10.750 --> 19:15.622
"We're over 40,
we have children.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.224
"I'm mother.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.861
"My son have a father.

19:21.894 --> 19:26.733
"Though he is not
as father as you like.

"I cannot take
my son from him.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.507
"Louie, you are...

19:36.209 --> 19:41.080
"kind and so fun.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.516
"I love our time together.

19:45.352 --> 19:49.856
"But we just have now,

19:49.889 --> 19:53.893
"and then we don't have
the rest of now.

19:58.298 --> 20:02.602
"Eternity beginning tomorrow.

20:02.635 --> 20:07.274
"I always remember you.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.675
I will miss you,
I ..."

20:08.708 --> 20:10.076
I...

20:18.751 --> 20:20.587
It's okay,
it's okay.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.259
I, um...

20:26.293 --> 20:27.694
I wish I had one.

20:27.727 --> 20:32.131
I don't have--
I don't...

20:32.164 --> 20:33.633
I feel the same.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.435
(translating)

20:35.468 --> 20:38.405
I feel the same.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.273
(translating)

20:40.307 --> 20:42.074
Um-hmm, um-hmm.

20:45.111 --> 20:48.648
I'm gonna be so-- I'm gonna
be so sad when you go.

20:48.681 --> 20:52.251
When you-- when you go.

20:52.285 --> 20:57.123
I'm gonna-- I'm already--
I'm gonna miss you.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.225
I'm gonna miss
you so much.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.061
But I wouldn't trade it.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.598
I wouldn't
trade it for anything.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.167
Except maybe a situation where
I knew what you were saying

21:08.200 --> 21:11.438
and I, and I can talk
to you and we'd live
in the same place.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.378
I'm so happy,
you know, uh...

21:28.154 --> 21:29.989
Um...
