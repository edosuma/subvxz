14:35.007 --> 14:37.942
We are not gonna get anywhere

We have to do the sensible thing.

- We'll move to Berlin.
- What?

14:42.882 --> 14:44.645
Bobby will be accepted there.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.982
I read somewhere that Germans,
they're a very tolerant people.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.317
Their culture admires all kinds of freaks.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.950
Our boy is not a freak. He's just confused.

15:25.891 --> 15:28.621
Bobby, how would you like
to go for a car ride?

15:29.828 --> 15:32.729
Look, Bobby, I'm as open-minded
as the next guy.

15:32.865 --> 15:36.596
But just so you know, most states
won't let you marry a plastic head.

15:36.735 --> 15:38.430
I don't want to marry it.

15:39.505 --> 15:43.236
I just needed to practice my first kiss,
so I don't look like an idiot.

15:43.375 --> 15:47.072
You're kissing a plastic head,

<i>Son, I'm doing this for your own good.</i>

15:50.983 --> 15:53.076
You're just using this head as a crutch.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.914
It's not a crutch, Dad.

15:54.987 --> 15:58.047
It's something I've come to rely on
to help me through life.

15:58.724 --> 16:01.454
Well, I'll make you a deal.
Go to your party.

16:01.527 --> 16:04.325
Afterwards, if you still want this head,
you can have it.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.557
But I won't need it after the party.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.894

TEACHER: Passable.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.295
<i>Good.</i>

17:13.632 --> 17:16.795
First, this is not the plastic head
you were issued.

17:16.902 --> 17:19.063
<i>Second, just look at the way you shaved...</i>

17:19.137 --> 17:21.800

And these are the worst sideburns
I've seen since Chair 3...

Don't cry, Luanne.
This is the best haircut I ever had.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.187
<i>The hair is all nice and uniform...</i>

17:45.264 --> 17:48.756

bumps here and here.

17:50.135 --> 17:53.627
<i>I layered on the upslopes

17:54.006 --> 17:56.873
Yep. This is my all-time favorite haircut.

Miss Platter?

18:03.182 --> 18:04.513
I'm sorry.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.608
I've been mean and unfair.

18:06.785 --> 18:09.049
I guess I just got so far from the hair...

18:09.121 --> 18:12.386
