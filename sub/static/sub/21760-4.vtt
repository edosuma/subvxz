Cruella:
Oh, you were
so right, Anita, darling.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.960
This picnic is precisely
what I needed.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.380
A chance to get away
from it all.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.960
Ah, to enjoy
the earthly pleasures

01:25.960 --> 01:28.580
of simple, peasant folk.

01:28.580 --> 01:31.040
Well, having you
join us, Cruella,

01:31.040 --> 01:34.120
was such an...
unexpected surprise.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.920
Well, I just knew that hang-up
on my voicemail

01:36.920 --> 01:39.670
must have been you calling
to invite me.

01:39.670 --> 01:41.330
Hey, come on, guys.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.500
Wish it were that easy
to get rid of Cruella.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.000
Maybe if I tied
a dollar around it.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.670
I got it.
I got it.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.880
Whoops.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.920
I guess I got it.

02:11.330 --> 02:13.040
Give, Mooch, give!

02:13.040 --> 02:14.830
Good boy.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.330
That's three in a row.

02:16.330 --> 02:19.210
Okay. And ready...

02:19.210 --> 02:21.580
You're toast, turkey lips.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.750
You're mouse meat,
midget mutt.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.540
Oww!

02:32.540 --> 02:35.080
Ah, the fresh country air.

02:37.330 --> 02:38.830
Where are my cigarettes?

02:38.830 --> 02:39.920
Oof!

02:39.920 --> 02:41.960
Whoa!

02:50.040 --> 02:52.080
Give, Cruella, give.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.880
Good girl.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.920
Woman:
Well, Lucky, it looks like
you're still a lucky dog.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.580
A few bandages and you'll
be good as new.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.040
Now there you go.

03:03.920 --> 03:07.920
Cruella:
Anita! Anita!

03:07.920 --> 03:11.460
Carry her to our house,
you said.

03:12.580 --> 03:13.920
Coming, Cruella.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.960
Oh, Anita, darling,

03:15.960 --> 03:19.710
this tacky foam pillow is
absolutely bruising my ankle.

03:19.710 --> 03:22.290
Haven't you anything in angora?

03:22.290 --> 03:24.500
Sorry. I'll see
what I can find.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.790
And another thing.
Where is that dumpy
little housekeeper, Ninny?

03:27.790 --> 03:30.620
I'm practically
wasting away.

03:30.620 --> 03:32.580
Nanny is visiting her sister.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.750
But I'll make you some lunch
now that the vet's finished
with Lucky.

03:37.960 --> 03:41.250
Lucky? You're not letting
that vicious beast in here,
are you?

03:41.250 --> 03:43.000
After he tried
to cripple me?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.460
My doctor said I may
never walk again.

03:45.460 --> 03:47.250
And he's an expert!

03:47.250 --> 03:48.790
Now, Cruella,

03:48.790 --> 03:50.960
he said you'll be
on your feet by tomorrow.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.620
That quack!
What does he know?

03:52.620 --> 03:55.040
I'm in far too much
agony to be moved.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.330
Oh...

03:57.330 --> 03:59.710
You know what,
I'll go start lunch.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.040
Hello?

04:08.040 --> 04:09.330
It's De Vil. Listen.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.880
I've had a horrendous
accident and I--

04:11.880 --> 04:13.170
What do you mean, again?

04:13.170 --> 04:14.750
-Stop laughing.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.830
No, of course I'm not hurt,
but they don't know that.

04:17.830 --> 04:20.000
Now look.
I want to sue the Dearlys

04:20.000 --> 04:22.540
and finally get this farm.

04:24.790 --> 04:27.290
What am I supposed
to do about it...?

04:27.290 --> 04:28.750
Well, how should I know?

04:28.750 --> 04:30.210
You're the lawyer!

04:30.210 --> 04:31.830
Start swindling.

04:31.830 --> 04:36.120
Oh, I just love when good things
happen to bad people.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.330
Oh, man, now I've done it.

04:40.330 --> 04:43.540
They're gonna lose
the farm because of me.

04:43.540 --> 04:46.540
Now, now,
no pity parties, Lucky.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.120
It's not all your fault.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.710
Tell him, guys.

04:49.710 --> 04:51.710
No. I think he's right.

04:51.710 --> 04:54.710
Mmm, yeah.
It's pretty much all his fault.

04:54.710 --> 04:57.620
Somehow we gotta prove
to Roger and Anita

04:57.620 --> 04:59.460
that Cruella's faking it.

04:59.460 --> 05:02.460
Maybe we could trick her
into walking.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.790
Then they'd see she's
not really hurt.

05:04.790 --> 05:07.880
Yeah. But

05:07.880 --> 05:10.830
What would Cruella
walk a mile for?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.380
Lucky: Yes!

05:19.580 --> 05:22.960
Anita! Remember my sandwiches
must be cut diagonally.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.290
No crusts!

05:24.290 --> 05:27.420
And don't make my tea too hot,
but not too cold either.

05:27.420 --> 05:29.210
And I want blueberry jam,
not raspberry,

05:29.210 --> 05:31.830
and good heavens,
please hurry!

05:31.830 --> 05:33.750
My nerves are already
frazzled enough

05:33.750 --> 05:36.420
without having to wait
for nourishment.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.830
Gum.

05:48.580 --> 05:49.880
Lucky: String.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.120
Chicken.

05:55.540 --> 05:57.290
I hate my life.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.750
Now... go!

06:13.710 --> 06:14.750
Oh...

06:14.750 --> 06:15.790
Ugh.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.380
Okay, okay...

06:28.380 --> 06:29.750
Now!

06:34.040 --> 06:35.080
Where are my--

06:38.210 --> 06:39.210
Oof!

06:41.120 --> 06:42.120
Ugh.

06:43.420 --> 06:45.620
Okay, this is it.
Get 'em in here, fast!

06:50.620 --> 06:52.210
Not now, Lucky.

06:52.210 --> 06:53.580
We'll play catch later.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.750
Lucky, I said no!

06:58.750 --> 07:00.460
What's gotten into you?

07:00.460 --> 07:02.170
Let go!

07:10.420 --> 07:11.460
Oof!

07:15.880 --> 07:17.580
And I demand that beast,

07:17.580 --> 07:19.620
who has probably
maimed me for life,

07:19.620 --> 07:21.040
be locked up forever!

07:21.040 --> 07:23.920
Sorry, Cruella, that is
just not gonna happen.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.330
Fine. Have it your way, Rupert.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.670
I was just going to sue you
for the farm,

07:28.670 --> 07:32.080
but now I'm taking you
for everything you've got!

07:34.330 --> 07:37.500
Just great. Now I've made
things even worse.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.540
There's gotta be some way
to prove she's faking.

07:40.540 --> 07:42.790
Are you sure she's still faking?

07:42.790 --> 07:45.460
I've seen healthier
looking roadkill.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.330
Ah, don't let her fool you.

07:47.330 --> 07:49.040
She's the picture of health.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.620
Picture?

07:50.620 --> 07:54.120
Hey, maybe we can get a picture
of her walking?

07:54.120 --> 07:55.750
Good thinking.

07:55.750 --> 07:58.710
Yeah, where does Roger
keep his old camera?

07:58.710 --> 08:00.540
Follow me.

08:06.500 --> 08:10.120
Get this blasted lawsuit
wrapped up before they
really hurt me.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.580
That mangy mutt is determined
to do me in.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.210
Come on.

08:18.460 --> 08:20.500
All right. So far, so good.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.040
So, where's the camera?

08:23.040 --> 08:25.170
Up there.

08:27.830 --> 08:29.170
Ready, troops?

08:29.170 --> 08:30.620
All: Ready.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.710
I think I see it.

08:37.710 --> 08:42.330
But this big, heavy round thing
is in the way.

08:42.330 --> 08:43.710
Whoa!

08:43.710 --> 08:45.580
-Whoa!
-Aah!

08:50.210 --> 08:52.080
Look, if I wanted ethics,

08:52.080 --> 08:53.620
I wouldn't have
hired a lawyer.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.500
Now get on it!

08:56.500 --> 08:57.670
Memo to myself.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.670
Tell my doctor I'm not
paying him real money

09:00.670 --> 09:02.330
for bandaging fake injuries.

09:02.330 --> 09:03.420
Huh?

09:07.500 --> 09:08.670
Aah!

09:13.880 --> 09:15.710
Anita!

09:15.710 --> 09:17.580
Anita:
Coming, Cruella.

09:20.210 --> 09:22.040
You want us to do what?!

09:22.040 --> 09:24.250
Get Cruella's tape recorder.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.460
You heard her.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.540
She confessed her whole
scheme into that thing.

09:27.540 --> 09:29.080
And we can prove it

09:29.080 --> 09:31.000
if we get that tape.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.620
But she always
keeps it with her.

09:33.620 --> 09:37.210
What are we gonna do,
steal it right from
under her nose?

09:43.290 --> 09:45.250
There it is.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.920
Got it.

10:03.290 --> 10:05.540
Hey, where's Rolly?

10:05.540 --> 10:07.620
Uh-oh...

10:11.040 --> 10:12.250
Whoa!

10:13.540 --> 10:15.420
Come on, Rolly.

10:16.960 --> 10:17.960
Whoa!

10:20.380 --> 10:22.170
Aah!

10:25.460 --> 10:26.710
Ugh.

10:41.620 --> 10:42.710
Give me that!

10:42.710 --> 10:45.250
Whoa!

10:45.250 --> 10:46.830
Memo to myself.

10:46.830 --> 10:49.540
Tell my doctor I'm not
paying him real money

10:49.540 --> 10:51.620
for bandaging
fake injuries.

10:51.620 --> 10:55.290
Fake injuries, my, my.

10:55.290 --> 10:58.880
And you had us waiting on you
hand and foot.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.460
Totally irrelevant.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.460
They're real injuries now.

11:02.460 --> 11:03.330
Watch.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.420
Oww! See?

11:05.420 --> 11:09.080
And this is the real proof
you tried to commit
insurance fraud.

11:09.080 --> 11:12.540
Now, now...

11:12.540 --> 11:14.460
No need to be hasty, Rover.

11:14.460 --> 11:17.250
Surely we can make
some kind of deal.

11:17.250 --> 11:18.460
Hmm?

11:29.120 --> 11:30.960
Here are your sandwiches.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.500
No crusts.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.830
Ahem.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.750
As you all know,

11:46.750 --> 11:50.750
the barking code is
the oldest form of
dog communication.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.500
Cool.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.420
And the most important element
to the barking code

11:55.420 --> 11:57.620
is the emergency command.

11:57.620 --> 12:01.670
Now, let's review a few
key phrases, shall we?

12:01.670 --> 12:03.120
Yip! Yip!

12:03.120 --> 12:04.330
Sheep.

12:04.330 --> 12:06.080
Excellent.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.330
-Yap!
-In.

12:08.330 --> 12:10.290
Bravo!

12:10.290 --> 12:11.420
Yow--

12:13.290 --> 12:17.500
Lucky

12:20.460 --> 12:22.290
Rolly?

12:24.250 --> 12:26.790
Cadpig!

12:26.790 --> 12:28.460
Wake up!

12:29.670 --> 12:31.960
Were you
dogs sleeping again?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.750
Sleeping

12:34.750 --> 12:37.210
No, sir. Never, sir.

12:37.210 --> 12:39.500
It's far too riveting.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.750
Is that right?

12:42.750 --> 12:45.040
Well, despite what
you might think,

12:45.040 --> 12:47.420
the barking chain
is crucial

12:47.420 --> 12:49.000
to your education.

12:52.670 --> 12:54.080
Urgent message, sir.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.250
Code red!

12:55.250 --> 12:56.580
Zounds!

12:56.580 --> 12:58.330
Duty calls.

12:58.330 --> 12:59.830
Cadets, in my absence,

12:59.830 --> 13:01.420
I'm assigning you
a substitute.

13:01.420 --> 13:02.670
Carry on.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.040
Wake us for dinner.

13:06.040 --> 13:09.290
But don't you wanna learn?

13:09.290 --> 13:10.960
Spot, don't you get it?

13:10.960 --> 13:13.380
Only geeks learn
barking code.

13:13.380 --> 13:15.040
And only losers teach it.

13:19.170 --> 13:21.920
Good day, sunshine.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.880
If you dirt weasels think

13:25.880 --> 13:28.080
that this is gonna be
another session

13:28.080 --> 13:30.380
of Sunday in the park
with grandpa,

13:30.380 --> 13:33.290
then think twice!

13:33.290 --> 13:35.750
Can I think
happy thoughts, lieutenant?

13:35.750 --> 13:37.460
Shut up, Caypon.

13:37.460 --> 13:39.120
It's Cadpig, sir.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.580
Whatever, Carpool,
now shut up and listen!

13:42.580 --> 13:46.170
I hear some of you
don't wanna learn code

13:46.170 --> 13:48.170
'cause you think it's useless.

13:48.170 --> 13:51.080
Well, as a code expert,

13:51.080 --> 13:53.710
I assure you that code
is vital

13:53.710 --> 13:55.210
during wartime.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.620
Wartime

13:57.620 --> 13:59.250
What war!?

13:59.250 --> 14:01.920
The only war, Cartwheel.

14:01.920 --> 14:06.880
The great cat war!

14:06.880 --> 14:09.670
True, it's not
like the good old days.

14:09.670 --> 14:12.000
Back then you could
drop a piano on them,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.710
flatten them
with a steamroller,

14:13.710 --> 14:15.290
paint a tunnel on a wall

14:15.290 --> 14:17.170
and they'd slam
right into it.

14:17.170 --> 14:19.380
I hate cats!

14:20.620 --> 14:23.290
Of course, now it's a cold war.

14:23.290 --> 14:25.120
So, we...

14:25.120 --> 14:27.330
We can't get away
with that anymore.

14:27.330 --> 14:30.460
This guy is one doughnut
short of a dozen.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.170
What did you say, Roll

14:34.170 --> 14:35.120
Nothing, sir.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.040
Smart guy, aren't you, Roll

14:38.040 --> 14:40.460
Well, let's just see
how smart you are

14:40.460 --> 14:43.000
when the cats are using
your behind

14:43.000 --> 14:44.500
for mouse bait!

14:44.500 --> 14:46.210
I hate cats!

14:46.210 --> 14:48.250
Now drop and give me--

14:50.290 --> 14:52.960
-There he goes again.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.670
Cadpig:
Who's gonna wake him?

14:54.670 --> 14:56.000
Rolly:
Not me.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.830
Colonel:
Yip, yap, yow!

14:58.830 --> 15:00.120
Did you hear something?

15:00.120 --> 15:01.750
Uh, that was my stomach.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.170
No. I distinctly heard...

15:04.170 --> 15:07.880
Colonel:
Yip, yap, yow!

15:07.880 --> 15:11.210
Emergency action message
from canine command!

15:11.210 --> 15:12.960
The cats are attacking!

15:12.960 --> 15:15.290
This is the big one!

15:17.290 --> 15:20.000
-Run!
-Every dog for himself!

15:20.000 --> 15:23.120
Uh, sir, I don't think
that's what the message said.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.460
Listen here, Einstein.

15:25.460 --> 15:27.670
I know what I heard,

15:27.670 --> 15:30.000
and I heard cats!

15:30.000 --> 15:33.120
So fall in now, now, now now!

15:36.540 --> 15:39.120
We've got to translate
that message.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.710
Fat chance.
We don't speak code.

15:41.710 --> 15:43.500
And whose fault is that?

15:43.500 --> 15:45.420
What are you getting at, bird?

15:45.420 --> 15:49.040
Oh, just that if certain members
of this entourage

15:49.040 --> 15:50.500
hadn't been asleep,

15:50.500 --> 15:52.210
we all might have
learned something.

15:52.210 --> 15:56.120
Everything will be fine
if we simply remain calm.

15:57.830 --> 16:01.170
The cats are coming!
The cats are coming!

16:05.750 --> 16:07.670
All right. Comb the farm.

16:07.670 --> 16:10.460
There must be some animal
that can translate that message.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.500
What was that word, dear?

16:13.500 --> 16:14.830
"Yow."

16:14.830 --> 16:16.960
Oh, it's been years.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.750
Let's see. Yow. Yow.

16:19.750 --> 16:23.380
Ooh, isn't that the name of
that nice young bull

16:23.380 --> 16:25.830
on "As the World Churns"?

16:25.830 --> 16:28.000
Mmm!

16:28.000 --> 16:30.170
Talk about beefcake.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.040
Mm-mmm.

16:35.710 --> 16:39.000
As your mayor,
it is an honor--

16:39.000 --> 16:41.080
no, a privilege to--

16:41.080 --> 16:43.620
no, it's my civic duty

16:43.620 --> 16:46.750
to supply you with
the meaning of that word.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.210
Thank you, sir.

16:48.210 --> 16:51.620
You did vote for me, right?

16:51.620 --> 16:54.080
Actually, no.

17:02.540 --> 17:06.670
So, the message was
"Yip, yap, yow"?

17:06.670 --> 17:08.790
You know what it means, right?

17:08.790 --> 17:12.080
Well now, you pups
is very, very lucky.

17:12.080 --> 17:13.960
'Cause I just happen to have

17:13.960 --> 17:18.000
the last remaining copy
of the official code book.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.210
Oh...

17:20.210 --> 17:21.380
No.

17:24.170 --> 17:27.080
Okay. "Yip" means Sheep.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.460
"Yap" means in.

17:29.460 --> 17:32.420
And "Yow" means...

17:34.000 --> 17:36.710
I can't believe we struck out.

17:36.710 --> 17:39.500
You can't?
Well, I can.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.710
If you'd take your lessons
a little more seriously,

17:42.710 --> 17:44.960
we'd b-b-be in much better--

17:44.960 --> 17:45.920
Yow!

17:47.670 --> 17:49.040
What was that?

17:49.040 --> 17:51.670
Oh, Spot's in
some kind of trouble.

17:51.670 --> 17:55.040
Yow! Yow!

17:55.040 --> 17:56.330
Yow--

17:56.330 --> 17:59.000
I've got it!
Yow means trouble!

17:59.000 --> 18:01.210
Yip, yap, yow.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.790
Sheep in trouble.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.580
That can only mean one thing.

18:04.580 --> 18:07.000
Stampede at Brazer's Green.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.710
Come on!

18:09.750 --> 18:11.920
Get me out of here!

18:11.920 --> 18:13.960
Spot, would you
quit fooling around.

18:26.670 --> 18:30.080
Why aren't they
helping with the war effort?

18:30.080 --> 18:33.830
It's an inside job!

18:39.960 --> 18:42.620
Oh, what do you know,
false alarm.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.040
Uh, let's look around.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.750
That was fun.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.710
Anyone for gelato?

18:53.710 --> 18:56.080
Something's fishy.

18:56.080 --> 18:59.620
You always gotta go
looking for trouble, don't you?

18:59.620 --> 19:02.710
Can't you just accept
that it was a false alarm?

19:02.710 --> 19:04.920
Here. I'll prove it to you.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.120
See? No sheep in trouble.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.540
Gosh, Rolly,
I guess you were right--

19:22.330 --> 19:23.960
Meep!

19:25.920 --> 19:29.540
Did anyone get
the license plate
of those sheep?

19:29.540 --> 19:31.380
Gah! They're coming back!

19:32.380 --> 19:33.420
Jump!

19:35.120 --> 19:36.750
What's gotten
into these sheep?

19:36.750 --> 19:38.750
It's like they've seen a ghost.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.210
Meep.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.580
Looks like we've got
a couple of comedians.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.120
Bob?

19:54.120 --> 19:55.170
Bill?

19:55.170 --> 19:56.580
Nyah-nyah!

19:56.580 --> 19:58.420
Made you run!

19:58.420 --> 19:59.920
Losers!

20:12.000 --> 20:14.080
And I thought
you guys had fights.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.330
Ugh. I feel like I've
been mugged by a cardigan.

20:17.330 --> 20:19.460
Those little demons.

20:19.460 --> 20:22.330
I shall wash,
but I shan't be clean.

20:22.330 --> 20:24.920
Come on!
Pug's gonna be looking for us.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.330
Relax.

20:26.330 --> 20:30.420
That bonehead couldn't find
his butt with both paws.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.920
Freeze, hairballs!

20:33.920 --> 20:37.710
You traitors are
all going down!

20:37.710 --> 20:41.040
-But--
-Don't but me, Cadpig!

20:41.040 --> 20:43.960
That's right! Cadpig!

20:43.960 --> 20:46.460
See what happens
when you try?

20:46.460 --> 20:51.170
You deserters have been
conspiring with the cats!

20:51.170 --> 20:52.920
And I'm gonna see

20:52.920 --> 20:55.710
that you do
hard time for it.

20:55.710 --> 20:57.580
Colonel:
What cats, Lieutenant?

20:58.670 --> 21:00.960
The feline invaders,
my Colonel.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.670
Not this again.

21:03.670 --> 21:05.960
I received an urgent
action message.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.210
And what message was that?

21:08.210 --> 21:10.420
Yip, yap, yow.

21:10.420 --> 21:11.710
Translation?

21:11.710 --> 21:14.620
Slavering hordes of cats
landing at 0800.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.170
Oh...

21:16.170 --> 21:18.330
Anyone else care to try?

21:18.330 --> 21:19.880
-Sheep.
-In.

21:19.880 --> 21:20.920
Trouble.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.380
Excellent job, cadets.

21:23.380 --> 21:25.880
I have a special treat
in store for all of you.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.290
Wait a minute.

21:28.290 --> 21:29.750
I took command.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.750
I faced the enemy!

21:31.750 --> 21:33.960
Granted, it was
a fictional enemy,

21:33.960 --> 21:36.210
but those are the worst kind.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.620
Don't I get a reward?

21:41.170 --> 21:44.920
Relax and enjoy, cadets.

21:44.920 --> 21:47.330
There's plenty more
where that came from.

21:47.330 --> 21:50.920
Man, if I had known
there was kibble involved,

21:50.920 --> 21:53.830
I would have saved those
sheep single pawed.

21:53.830 --> 21:56.580
Where's Pug?
Isn't he joining us?

21:56.580 --> 21:58.920
Yes, well, I put Pug
in charge

21:58.920 --> 22:00.750
of a very important emergency.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.380
A code K emergency.

22:05.210 --> 22:06.580
Kittens.

22:06.580 --> 22:10.620
I hate babysitting kittens.
