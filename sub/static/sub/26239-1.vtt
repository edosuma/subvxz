01:53.387 --> 01:56.156
- Mr. Simms?
- Yes.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.560
Mr. Beach is this way.

02:15.611 --> 02:18.344
And I think
on the next model,

02:18.346 --> 02:20.546
the guns
should be even bigger.

02:20.548 --> 02:22.983
Yeah. Again, sir, these are
not your standard guns.

02:22.985 --> 02:25.252
- These are lasers.
- I like bigger.

02:25.254 --> 02:26.986
People like bigger.

02:26.988 --> 02:29.088
Yes, but what-what I'm
trying to explain to you...

02:29.090 --> 02:30.522
Bigger!

02:30.524 --> 02:32.192
Mr. Beach?

02:32.194 --> 02:33.460
I'm busy.

02:33.462 --> 02:38.664
I'm busy, Kelly, explaining
to Grant the importance of <i>big.</i>

02:38.666 --> 02:41.501
You know, on second thought,
why don't you explain it?

02:41.503 --> 02:44.537
I mean as a woman, you
certainly have a firm grasp

02:44.539 --> 02:46.640
on why big is preferred.

02:46.642 --> 02:50.075
Sir, Mr. Diomedes Simms is here.

02:50.077 --> 02:53.013
He... You're not
what I was expecting.

02:53.015 --> 02:57.283
I assure you, sir, no one
tells stories as well as I.

02:57.285 --> 02:59.285
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

02:59.287 --> 03:03.956
Your kind are particularly
accomplished liars, aren't they?

03:03.958 --> 03:04.926
Oh?

03:06.227 --> 03:08.360
You know about my kind?

03:08.362 --> 03:13.300
Oh, Mr. Simms, my prisons
are filled with your kind.

03:13.302 --> 03:15.602
Surely not because
of any issues

03:15.604 --> 03:20.306
with an unjust application
of "just-us."

03:20.308 --> 03:24.377
Look, I'm the largest
builder and owner

03:24.379 --> 03:26.278
of private prisons
in this country,

03:26.280 --> 03:30.015
and I can tell you
your brothers and sisters

03:30.017 --> 03:32.953
make up an enormous part
of my profits.

03:32.955 --> 03:35.421
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.122
Kelly, how long until
that press conference?

03:37.124 --> 03:39.124
Uh, just a couple
of hours, sir.

03:39.126 --> 03:40.693
Shit.

03:40.695 --> 03:42.230
Shit.

03:43.030 --> 03:44.099
Excuse me?

03:45.701 --> 03:46.969
Nothing.

03:50.539 --> 03:52.671
You've got ten minutes
to impress me.

03:52.673 --> 03:55.241
Grant, explain to Simms
why he's here.

03:55.243 --> 03:57.076
Yes. Uh, right away.

03:57.078 --> 04:02.716
Uh, sir, we are in the last
stage before full production

04:02.718 --> 04:05.421
of what I can
only refer to as...

04:07.522 --> 04:09.389
a sentient robot.

04:09.391 --> 04:12.491
The Robo-Patriot,
the future of American Security.

04:12.493 --> 04:14.326
A robot police force?

04:14.328 --> 04:16.663
That I own and control.

04:16.665 --> 04:18.130
- You ever hear of AI?
- Mm.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.665
That's Artificial Intelligence.

04:19.666 --> 04:22.569
Oh, I see artificial
intelligence all the time.

04:22.571 --> 04:23.737
Mm.

04:23.739 --> 04:27.540
- Well, I call it...
- I call it. I, Grant.

04:27.542 --> 04:28.945
I call it.

04:30.045 --> 04:31.310
- Mr. Beach calls it...
- Yeah.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.646
RI,
Real Intelligence.

04:33.648 --> 04:37.216
You see, because it can learn
from first-hand experience,

04:37.218 --> 04:39.785
but like a person, it can also
learn from second-hand experience,

04:39.787 --> 04:43.723
so stories, fables, tales.

04:43.725 --> 04:46.192
- That's where you come in.
- Hmm.

04:46.194 --> 04:47.427
That's right.

04:47.429 --> 04:49.661
You're here
to tell it tales

04:49.663 --> 04:52.132
so that it has
an even broader base

04:52.134 --> 04:57.403
from which to assess who is worthy of
detention, jail, even-even execution.

04:57.405 --> 04:59.605
Execution?

04:59.607 --> 05:02.307
Well, that sounds
so final

05:02.309 --> 05:07.547
and not nearly as lucrative
as indefinite incarceration.

05:07.549 --> 05:10.817
Some things I do are just
because it's the right thing.

05:10.819 --> 05:13.653
Indeed.

05:13.655 --> 05:15.254
Indeed.

05:15.256 --> 05:17.223
But let's hear
one of those stories

05:17.225 --> 05:20.459
that I'm supposed to be willing
to write you a check for.

05:20.461 --> 05:23.530
Great. Uh, we're already linked
into the robot and recording, sir.

05:23.532 --> 05:28.401
Let's see. Something to
make your creation choose

05:28.403 --> 05:31.670
the correct individual
for incarceration.

05:31.672 --> 05:35.141
- Yes.
- Well, there are so many possibilities.

05:35.143 --> 05:37.343
Give me a theme.

05:37.345 --> 05:39.678
Well, let's pull one
from the headlines.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.648
Now, since I already
have so many black lives

05:42.650 --> 05:45.485
filling the beds
of my facilities,

05:45.487 --> 05:49.689
how about
Black Lives Matter?

05:49.691 --> 05:52.158
Of course.
Of course.

05:52.160 --> 05:56.762
Now this is the story
of criminal behavior,

05:56.764 --> 06:00.533
and how one particular
black life mattered.

06:00.535 --> 06:04.336
I call it...
"Good Golly."

06:12.413 --> 06:15.482
What?
What is he talking about?

06:15.484 --> 06:17.516
Oh, my gosh.

06:17.518 --> 06:18.687
Where are we goin'?

06:21.422 --> 06:23.122
This is it! Zoe!

06:23.124 --> 06:24.423
Zoe, look!
This is it!

06:24.425 --> 06:25.692
Your stupid brother
is still hiking.

06:25.694 --> 06:27.427
It's like we're not
on the same vacation.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.661
Oh, come on. We will
catch up with him later.

06:29.663 --> 06:30.598
Let's go.

06:41.208 --> 06:43.509
Can you believe I found it?
Ready?

06:43.511 --> 06:46.379
I don't like the
looks of this place.

06:46.381 --> 06:48.417
Oh, it'll be fun!
Come on.

07:07.869 --> 07:09.171
Huh.

07:14.609 --> 07:17.543
"No bad idea ever dies.

07:17.545 --> 07:21.850
It only lies dormant until the
pungent rains of the demon spring."

07:31.359 --> 07:32.458
Wait!

07:32.460 --> 07:34.394
"God bless this hell?"

07:34.396 --> 07:36.228
Jesus, do we really
have to do this?

07:36.230 --> 07:38.766
It's cool!
God blessed it.

08:00.956 --> 08:03.225
Okay, this is crazy.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.492
Not as crazy as that!

08:07.494 --> 08:09.761
Zoe, look!

08:09.763 --> 08:11.697
No, that is insane.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.632
Huh.

08:13.634 --> 08:16.603
"Coon Chicken Inn."

08:16.605 --> 08:19.305
Okay, so this is the door
that people came in through

08:19.307 --> 08:21.773
when they wanted
some chicken.

08:21.775 --> 08:24.009
The Colonel's chicken made
you wanna lick your fingers,

08:24.011 --> 08:26.579
but that guy was licking you.

08:26.581 --> 08:27.516
Mmm? Mmm?

08:30.384 --> 08:32.921
And this?
This is like, what?

08:36.756 --> 08:38.393
You find that amusing?

08:40.693 --> 08:43.562
Uh, well, yeah,
actually.

08:43.563 --> 08:45.764
I mean, who looks like that?

08:45.766 --> 08:46.701
Who indeed.

08:50.038 --> 08:52.971
Slave masters used to brand
their property with a hot iron,

08:52.973 --> 08:56.341
but as we became free
men and women,

08:56.343 --> 08:58.778
America needed a new way
to mark its property,

08:58.780 --> 09:02.347
a new way to control the Negro,
keep him in his place.

09:02.349 --> 09:05.051
So instead of
hot coals and metal,

09:05.053 --> 09:09.688
they used pen, paint, and ink.

09:09.690 --> 09:11.826
No branding iron necessary.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.932
Come this way.

09:18.900 --> 09:21.668
Lazy, shiftless,

09:21.670 --> 09:24.671
gluttonous, lying,

09:24.673 --> 09:27.639
over-sexed, ugly,

09:27.641 --> 09:30.809
violent, stupid.

09:30.811 --> 09:33.613
And this way,
the American nigger/Negro

09:33.615 --> 09:37.049
became the first true
corporate brand.

09:53.001 --> 09:58.104
Yeah, this country used to
be just really messed up.

09:58.106 --> 09:59.706
No doubt.

09:59.708 --> 10:01.506
Better now, is it?

10:01.508 --> 10:03.942
Well, I mean,
we're friends, so...

10:03.944 --> 10:05.812
Since
grade school, so...

10:05.814 --> 10:06.879
Yeah!

10:06.881 --> 10:08.681
Tsss!

10:08.683 --> 10:09.751
Yeah.

10:10.751 --> 10:12.554
- Mmm.
- We should go.

10:13.987 --> 10:17.724
- Uh, do you have any gollys?
- Gollys?

10:17.726 --> 10:18.827
Yeah, like...

10:19.894 --> 10:20.927
this?

10:20.929 --> 10:22.095
Hey!

10:22.097 --> 10:23.663
Careful!

10:23.665 --> 10:25.831
I was just leaning
against a chair.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.533
Yeah, Zoe.
Careful.

10:27.535 --> 10:30.736
That chair's made from the
sacred wood of a slave ship.

10:30.738 --> 10:32.938
The grain is a product
of the bloodshed

10:32.940 --> 10:34.907
by men and women
who were beaten and died

10:34.909 --> 10:37.809
chained within its bowels as
it traversed the Middle Passage.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.711
Mm.

10:39.713 --> 10:41.547
That was like
the black holocaust.

10:41.549 --> 10:42.914
And, duh!

10:42.916 --> 10:45.384
The entire American slave
experience was a holocaust,

10:45.386 --> 10:48.453
which, I might add,
continues today.

10:48.455 --> 10:51.157
Its dark repercussions
keep bearing fruit.

10:51.159 --> 10:52.591
Can we please go?

10:52.593 --> 10:54.494
About the gollys,

10:54.496 --> 10:59.164
the golliwogs, um, I heard
you had golliwogs for sale?

10:59.166 --> 11:01.134
This is a museum.
Nothing is for sale!

11:01.136 --> 11:02.504
Oh, but...

11:04.104 --> 11:06.841
Oh, he looks
just like my first.

11:08.108 --> 11:09.609
Hi, Golly.

11:09.611 --> 11:11.547
My little Golly Gee.

11:12.646 --> 11:14.746
How about 800?

11:14.748 --> 11:17.482
Others have offered thousands,
and I tell them all the same...

11:17.484 --> 11:20.986
No. This doll, in particular,
has been through too much.

11:20.988 --> 11:24.690
It's carried over 100 years of
racism in its small, delicate frame,

11:24.692 --> 11:27.192
a racism created in America

11:27.194 --> 11:29.796
that's traveled to England,
Australia and beyond.

11:29.798 --> 11:33.666
Okay, well, my great gran had a collection,
and she started me collecting,

11:33.668 --> 11:36.536
so, honestly, I don't
really see it as racist.

11:36.538 --> 11:40.740
Just a warm, comforting
part of my childhood.

11:40.742 --> 11:44.043
Mammy slaves also gave white children
comfort in their childhoods,

11:44.045 --> 11:47.580
cradling them, feeding them
from their swollen, bruised tits

11:47.582 --> 11:51.484
as their own babies were sold,
raped, or otherwise neglected.

11:51.486 --> 11:53.686
As comforting as they were,

11:53.688 --> 11:56.688
I don't think you should have
a mammy to play with either.

11:56.690 --> 11:59.024
For God sakes, it's a doll.

11:59.026 --> 12:01.760
It's a tool, an instrument
of manipulation

12:01.762 --> 12:03.863
that kills the spirit
of who we really are

12:03.865 --> 12:06.798
by presenting the lie
others wish to see.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.235
Is being your comfort any better
than being your slave?

12:09.237 --> 12:10.735
Or are they the same?

12:10.737 --> 12:13.905
Okay, seriously!
This is just ridiculous.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.475
Black rappers call themselves
nigger all the time,

12:16.477 --> 12:19.144
and I can't even have
a cute, little black doll?

12:19.146 --> 12:21.514
Your friend's whiteness is showing.

12:21.516 --> 12:24.249
W-Well, she's kind
of right, isn't she?

12:24.251 --> 12:29.554
No. That doll is the reason many black men
and women still call themselves niggers.

12:29.556 --> 12:31.624
They, too,
have accepted the branding.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.658
Marshall McLuhan was right.

12:33.660 --> 12:37.562
"The medium is the message,"
and the message has taken hold.

12:37.564 --> 12:42.201
This poor, misshapen creature

12:42.203 --> 12:44.570
was given life
by a white English woman

12:44.572 --> 12:46.873
and nurtured on the tit
of racism,

12:46.875 --> 12:49.174
a foul aberration
that refuses to die,

12:49.176 --> 12:52.245
as new generations resuscitate
its tortured soul.

12:52.247 --> 12:56.215
Trust me. This doll
will bring no comfort.

12:56.217 --> 13:00.786
It's filled with all the pain and
torment 100 years of hate can produce.

13:00.788 --> 13:05.527
It may give you what you want,
but not how you want it.

13:07.261 --> 13:08.664
Good day, ladies.

13:09.764 --> 13:10.899
Let's go.

13:49.570 --> 13:52.672
So, this is where-where
the doll is?

13:52.674 --> 13:54.941
I can't believe
you talked me into this.

13:54.943 --> 13:57.846
Oh, come on. You hated that
old guy even more than I did.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.681
So, can you
get us in?

14:01.683 --> 14:03.014
You're kidding me.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.783
Locks from old buildings
like this

14:04.785 --> 14:06.952
are practically
from the stone ages.

14:06.954 --> 14:08.155
Well, go do your thing.

14:16.197 --> 14:17.663
Done.

14:17.665 --> 14:18.534
Piece of cake.

14:32.814 --> 14:36.349
- God, your brother is such a felon.
- Yeah, I know.

14:36.351 --> 14:39.018
You weren't complaining last night when
I "fell in" to your "you-know-what."

14:39.020 --> 14:40.923
Shut up, nasty.

14:42.155 --> 14:44.923
Mm! I'm comin'
for that ass, girl.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.859
I'm gonna grab it.
I want to get it, girl.

14:46.861 --> 14:48.394
I see it bouncin'.
Come here. Come here!

14:50.832 --> 14:52.030
Don't.

14:52.032 --> 14:55.267
What...
is all this stuff?

14:55.269 --> 14:57.937
Basically a museum
of fucked-up history.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.138
Yeah.

14:59.140 --> 15:00.842
Oh, cool.

15:01.642 --> 15:02.942
What?

15:02.944 --> 15:04.943
It's a-a whippin' post.

15:04.945 --> 15:08.014
- You know, like where if, uh, if I was your "masta"?
- Mm.

15:08.016 --> 15:10.216
I'd tie up and punish
your pretty black ass

15:10.218 --> 15:13.653
for not obeying my every perverted white man desire.

15:13.655 --> 15:15.324
Aw.

15:21.728 --> 15:24.865
I'm so scared, Big Daddy.

15:29.804 --> 15:32.138
Hi there, Golly Gee.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.974
Oh, are you tired
of being locked in there?

15:34.976 --> 15:36.878
Let me get you out.

15:38.846 --> 15:43.816
Okay, um,
how do I get you out?

15:43.818 --> 15:47.318
Guess I'll just have to bring this
whole thing back to the hotel with me

15:47.320 --> 15:50.358
and get you
out of this backwards town.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.292
Better turn around, girl.

15:53.294 --> 15:54.894
I'm gonna
warm them cheeks up,

15:54.896 --> 15:56.895
and then I'm gonna
storm them cheeks.

15:56.897 --> 15:59.965
You're so nasty, Daddy!

15:59.967 --> 16:04.135
Okay, ew! You guys, I do not want
to hear your sicko sex talk.

16:04.137 --> 16:07.306
Uh, you fucked
my brother first.

16:07.308 --> 16:09.408
Yeah, and-and we had to listen
to how he used to call you

16:09.410 --> 16:11.811
- his "snow-white ho."
- What?

16:11.813 --> 16:14.379
Disgusting. My brother was
your nasty black golliwog.

16:14.381 --> 16:16.381
Whatever!

16:16.383 --> 16:18.152
Yeah, it looks like
payback is my bitch.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.655
Oh!

16:23.223 --> 16:25.224
Shit. Come on!

16:27.428 --> 16:29.731
Get it off me!

16:32.733 --> 16:33.798
- Are you okay?
- You okay?

16:33.800 --> 16:35.801
Help me, please.

16:37.070 --> 16:38.873
Uh! Oh!

16:40.373 --> 16:41.974
Guys!

16:41.976 --> 16:44.110
It's not like you're gonna
need the glass anyway.

16:44.112 --> 16:47.212
It's probably a good thing we broke
some stuff or stealed some other stuff.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.514
Otherwise, it's gonna be
pretty obvious who stole it

16:49.516 --> 16:51.750
if the only thing missing
is that stupid doll!

16:51.752 --> 16:54.787
He is not stupid!
He is a cuddly cutie.

16:54.789 --> 16:56.355
Isn't that right, Golly Gee?

16:56.357 --> 16:58.059
- Oh, my gosh.
- Golly?

16:59.327 --> 17:00.761
Hey, look at this.

17:04.298 --> 17:05.431
Golly?

17:05.433 --> 17:07.066
<i>The Three Little Gollies.</i>

17:07.068 --> 17:10.201
Oh. Let me see.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.037
Where are you,
Golly?

17:12.039 --> 17:13.439
"One time,

17:13.441 --> 17:19.545
three adventurous golliwogs...
Golly, Woggie, and Nigger...

17:19.547 --> 17:23.249
chose to go for a walk
to Bumble Bee Lane.

17:23.251 --> 17:29.788
Golly wasn't ready, so Woggie and Nigger
decided they would begin without him,

17:29.790 --> 17:34.993
- allowing Golly to catch up as soon as he could."
- Golly?

17:34.995 --> 17:37.363
"So off went Woggie and
Nigger, arm-in-arm,

17:37.365 --> 17:40.833
spiritedly singing
their favorite song,

17:40.835 --> 17:45.807
which you may have guessed
was ‘Ten Little Nigger Boys.'"

17:49.176 --> 17:51.277
- That's kinda racist, huh?
- Yeah.

17:51.279 --> 17:52.577
Golly?

17:52.579 --> 17:54.281
Look at this.

17:55.582 --> 17:57.449
<i>Golliwog Goes to Hell.</i>

17:57.451 --> 17:59.084
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

17:59.086 --> 18:00.922
Oh, hold on.
Wait.

18:02.990 --> 18:05.958
"A nig,

18:05.960 --> 18:09.295
a nog,
uh, wake up Golliwog.

18:09.297 --> 18:12.867
Make some golly fun and 'den
go right back to sleep again."

18:15.069 --> 18:16.935
That's it?

18:16.937 --> 18:19.204
Yeah. The rest of the
pages are just blank.

18:19.206 --> 18:20.308
What?

18:22.475 --> 18:25.277
There you are, Golly!

18:25.279 --> 18:27.212
Hi. Aw.

18:27.214 --> 18:29.515
- Audrey? You're bleeding.
- Hmm?

18:29.517 --> 18:32.151
Did you get
cut from the glass?

18:32.153 --> 18:34.286
I-I don't think so.

18:34.288 --> 18:35.520
It's the doll.

18:35.522 --> 18:37.423
- It's the doll!
- What? What?

18:37.425 --> 18:38.390
Uh!

18:42.463 --> 18:43.498
Oh...

18:53.473 --> 18:55.374
Run!

18:57.278 --> 18:59.280
No!

19:21.001 --> 19:21.837
Stop. No.

19:24.004 --> 19:25.306
Stop.

19:49.496 --> 19:52.431
There's no need
for that, Golly Gee.

19:52.433 --> 19:56.367
Don't you know that you
were always my favorite?

19:56.369 --> 19:58.002
It...

19:58.004 --> 20:01.475
Hey, don't you know
that I love you?

20:02.944 --> 20:04.378
Can't you just love me?

20:05.578 --> 20:08.082
Can't we just
love each other?

20:09.082 --> 20:10.084
Huh?

20:13.287 --> 20:15.223
Mmm.

20:31.605 --> 20:34.306
Childbirth is often
a joyous occasion.

20:34.308 --> 20:36.174
No. No.

20:36.176 --> 20:39.013
But I don't believe you're gonna
make it through this pregnancy.

20:40.213 --> 20:44.016
Oh, what do we have here?

20:44.018 --> 20:45.620
You're ready to pop.

20:55.128 --> 20:58.596
I promise I'll bury you next to
your brother and your friend.

20:58.598 --> 21:02.000
I don't care if I die,
but for the sake of the baby,

21:02.002 --> 21:03.672
I should give birth
in a hospital.

21:06.107 --> 21:09.210
Sorry, you can't leave.
How could I ever explain this?

21:13.780 --> 21:15.713
Good-bye, Audrey.

21:15.715 --> 21:19.451
It's time for you to bear
the fruit of your passion.

21:56.456 --> 21:59.258
I love you, my gollies.

21:59.260 --> 22:02.097
Oh, baby.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.731
Fuckin' white women
and havin' babies.

22:06.733 --> 22:09.667
But how dare they
call you a stereotype.

22:09.669 --> 22:12.538
You're just the creation
they designed you to be.

22:24.851 --> 22:28.653
<i>The tale has been
successfully stored in the Patriot's memory.</i>

22:31.258 --> 22:33.424
Well, Mr. Simms,
entertaining,

22:33.426 --> 22:36.494
and I guess she got
what was coming to her.

22:36.496 --> 22:39.765
Yes, the offspring
of evil intent

22:39.767 --> 22:44.635
will always find fertile ground
to bear its bitter fruit.

22:44.637 --> 22:46.571
That was a good story, Simms.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.607
And yes, yes, yes, yes,
the doll got stolen,

22:49.609 --> 22:51.777
but do you have anything
more to the point

22:51.779 --> 22:54.782
from a-a criminal standpoint?

22:56.183 --> 22:58.416
How about a story
about gangsters?

22:58.418 --> 22:59.750
Gangsters, yes!

22:59.752 --> 23:01.319
Now, that's something

23:01.321 --> 23:05.324
the Robo-Patriot could go
after to protect America

23:05.326 --> 23:07.228
and fill my prisons.

23:08.361 --> 23:10.831
Well, this story begins...

23:12.198 --> 23:14.401
as many tales
in the hood do...

23:15.536 --> 23:17.572
with a violent beat down.

23:20.508 --> 23:21.943
I don't know
what you talkin' about.

23:25.812 --> 23:27.813
Whoo! Goddamn!

23:27.815 --> 23:29.882
Hey, you see the sweat fly off his head?

23:29.884 --> 23:32.483
Now, see, that's some ol' George Foreman
Thrilla-In-Manila shit right there!

23:32.485 --> 23:33.785
Nah, that's
Rumble-In-The-Jungle, Booze.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.825
Ali kicked Frazier's ass
in Manila, like this!

23:37.790 --> 23:39.857
Hoo!

23:39.859 --> 23:42.260
Goddamn.
"Down goes Frazier!

23:42.262 --> 23:44.229
The Champ is down!
The Champ is out!

23:44.231 --> 23:45.864
Only four minutes left
in the fight!

23:45.866 --> 23:48.299
How do you feel, Champ?"

23:48.301 --> 23:50.801
Is what he said,
ladies and gentlemen!

23:50.803 --> 23:53.440
"Mike Tyson
has been knocked out!"

23:55.209 --> 23:59.611
"Cliff Bettis, super-pimp,
the Heidi Fleiss of the hood!"

23:59.613 --> 24:03.248
"You don't look pretty now, you
sorry ho-running motherfucker!"

24:05.618 --> 24:08.519
Now, Cliff,
I know you want to prove

24:08.521 --> 24:11.323
that you got some
big-ass brass balls.

24:11.325 --> 24:13.759
I know. And I know you don't
want to get punked out,

24:13.761 --> 24:17.863
but these fools havin' too much fun
fuckin' you the fuck up, playa.

24:17.865 --> 24:20.499
Believe that!

24:20.501 --> 24:22.670
Why don't you just go ahead...
No, look at me.

24:24.738 --> 24:26.505
Go ahead on.

24:26.507 --> 24:28.941
Tell us where you got
that $5 million hid at,

24:28.943 --> 24:32.844
so while ya still got
some face left to lose, man.

24:32.846 --> 24:35.980
Now, don't try
and deny it no more.

24:35.982 --> 24:38.784
I'm way harder to fool than
the IRS, boy, and I know...

24:38.786 --> 24:42.287
I know where you got
all these fancy-ass cars from.

24:42.289 --> 24:46.692
Listen to me.
That money is for my foundation.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.695
Hm. Foundation.

24:50.998 --> 24:52.663
Whatcha building?

24:52.665 --> 24:55.634
I'm not a pimp anymore.

24:55.636 --> 24:58.502
I gave all that up.

24:58.504 --> 25:01.506
I had what you call...
a revelation.

25:01.508 --> 25:03.008
This nigga
had an "e-pimp-phany."

25:03.010 --> 25:04.843
Man, that nigger lyin'!

25:04.845 --> 25:07.378
I'm a legitimate
businessman now.

25:07.380 --> 25:10.015
I got
seven full franchises,

25:10.017 --> 25:13.251
three car washes,
and one supermarket,

25:13.253 --> 25:15.622
all creating jobs
in the community.

25:16.790 --> 25:18.824
Come on, man.

25:18.826 --> 25:20.892
We got so many people
trying to keep us down,

25:20.894 --> 25:23.894
we need to be lifting
each other up right now

25:23.896 --> 25:26.434
so the next generation
don't have to live like this.

25:28.735 --> 25:31.539
We gotta stop with this killing
each other in the streets, man.

25:33.507 --> 25:37.679
That money that you're trying to take
is for my charitable foundation.

25:38.846 --> 25:41.747
We're gonna open
two magnet schools

25:41.749 --> 25:45.616
and give scholarships to poor black kids
so they can get up out of this hellhole.

25:47.488 --> 25:51.490
Damn. Damn, shit.
I ain't know that.

25:51.492 --> 25:52.393
S-So...

25:54.528 --> 25:56.595
So, you're trying to
give back to the community

25:56.597 --> 25:58.997
and-and change lives and shit.

25:58.999 --> 26:01.767
Like turn all that dirt
you done into good deeds.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.035
Exactly.

26:03.037 --> 26:05.770
We all could do some good work.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.874
I don't give a fuck about none of
that bleedin' heart bullshit, nigga!

26:08.876 --> 26:12.310
I'm in this world
to get mine.

26:12.312 --> 26:14.712
Fuck your
United Nigger College Fund,

26:14.714 --> 26:17.316
and fuck them kids!

26:17.318 --> 26:20.719
They want to make some real
money, send 'em to me.

26:20.721 --> 26:24.056
Have 'em selling dope on the street
and make all the money they need.

26:24.058 --> 26:28.593
Shoot. Start talkin'
or finish dyin', nigga.

26:32.332 --> 26:33.597
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

26:33.599 --> 26:35.602
There you go.
There you go.

26:36.436 --> 26:39.037
Okay. Okay.

26:39.039 --> 26:40.071
He said okay.

26:40.073 --> 26:41.373
Okay. Okay.

26:41.375 --> 26:42.574
Okay.

26:42.576 --> 26:44.009
Okay.

26:44.011 --> 26:46.877
Now, that's smart.

26:46.879 --> 26:50.615
I knew we'd eventually beat
some sense into your ass.

26:50.617 --> 26:52.483
Now, go on and tell me

26:52.485 --> 26:54.821
where you got your little
secret cash stash hid at.

26:57.724 --> 27:01.625
You know that sorry-ass ho-house
I used to run over on Seventh?

27:01.627 --> 27:02.664
Yeah.

27:04.063 --> 27:08.999
On the top floor,
way in the back,

27:09.001 --> 27:12.040
I got the nastiest crack ho
in the city.

27:13.706 --> 27:16.010
No pride at all.

27:17.077 --> 27:20.381
Do anything to anybody.

27:22.116 --> 27:25.549
Rumor is animal control
uses her blood

27:25.551 --> 27:27.421
to put down rabid dogs.

27:28.388 --> 27:30.422
So what about her?

27:30.424 --> 27:32.156
That's your mama!

27:34.094 --> 27:35.797
I hid the money in her snatch.

27:41.568 --> 27:44.068
That's a funny motherfucker
right there.

27:44.070 --> 27:45.903
Yeah, nigga?
Yeah, nigga?

27:45.905 --> 27:48.606
In her fuckin' snatch, huh?
You ain't sayin' nothin', bitch!

27:48.608 --> 27:51.108
- I'll bet you gonna do nothin'.
- Fuckin' chill, bitch!

27:51.110 --> 27:53.778
Chill! Chill!

27:53.780 --> 27:55.946
Man, get off me!

27:55.948 --> 27:57.749
Chill, bro.

27:57.751 --> 28:00.054
Nigga,
'dat shit was funny!

28:02.688 --> 28:05.423
Are you telling me this fool fuckin'
around with a regular lady now?

28:05.425 --> 28:09.428
Yep. A singer name
Sandra Blake.

28:09.430 --> 28:12.864
What kinda pimp falls in love with
a bitch that ain't even a ho?

28:12.866 --> 28:15.499
You know where she be at?

28:15.501 --> 28:17.435
Oh, yeah, she be at the
club down the street.

28:17.437 --> 28:18.202
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:18.204 --> 28:19.471
What she look like?

28:19.473 --> 28:21.740
Bro, she bad
as fuck, man.

28:21.742 --> 28:25.143
So we take that bitch and run, you think this
nigga gonna fuckin' start talkin' or what?

28:25.145 --> 28:27.746
Yo, he got to talk. He-He
in love with her, man.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.580
Pimp in love.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.182
Now, what you go
and do that for?

28:31.184 --> 28:34.019
That wasn't smart.
That wasn't smart.

28:34.021 --> 28:35.686
You know
that nigga crazy.

28:39.859 --> 28:41.660
Boy, you crazy.

28:48.501 --> 28:49.604
Nigga, you, uh...

28:55.475 --> 28:56.842
Nigga, what the fuck's so funny?

28:56.844 --> 28:58.413
What the fuck
you laughin' at?

29:00.246 --> 29:01.748
Oh, I was just thinkin'...

29:02.883 --> 29:06.116
how you real tough... now.

29:08.888 --> 29:13.892
Real bad dude.

29:13.894 --> 29:18.063
But heard you wasn't so hard
when you was up in Quentin.

29:18.065 --> 29:21.869
Heard Bobby Sanchez was digging
up in your ass on the regular.

29:23.770 --> 29:25.036
Bitch-nigga.

29:35.616 --> 29:36.780
What...?

29:36.782 --> 29:38.185
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

29:40.787 --> 29:43.020
Booze, you
ignorant-ass motherfucka!

29:43.022 --> 29:44.588
What you hit him
that hard for?

29:44.590 --> 29:46.057
Look, man, he was
talkin' shit, a'ight?

29:46.059 --> 29:47.526
Look, fuck his punk ass!

29:47.528 --> 29:49.594
Fuck his punk ass?

29:49.596 --> 29:51.962
How we gonna find where the
money at now, huh, Booze?

29:51.964 --> 29:54.132
He the only one
that knew where it was!

29:54.134 --> 29:56.166
What now?

29:56.168 --> 29:57.704
- What now?
- Look, I don't know!

29:59.705 --> 30:00.741
Fuck!

30:04.278 --> 30:06.778
Go.

30:06.780 --> 30:10.281
Take this fool and you dump this nigga
body somewhere nobody'll find it.

30:10.283 --> 30:12.550
Think you could do that
without fuckin' up?

30:12.552 --> 30:13.854
That something
you could handle?

30:24.196 --> 30:25.763
<i>Good afternoon, everybody.</i>

30:25.765 --> 30:28.066
I want to thank you all
for being so patient.

30:28.068 --> 30:29.800
We're running just a few
minutes behind right now,

30:29.802 --> 30:32.836
but Mr. Lloyd will be out
very shortly, okay?

30:34.774 --> 30:37.107
So, since when
do you believe in psychics?

30:37.109 --> 30:39.243
He's on television.

30:39.245 --> 30:40.878
Oh, oh, okay.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.780
So he must be real.

30:42.782 --> 30:45.349
Well, of course.
He's on television.

30:45.351 --> 30:47.184
- Oh.
- He's very compelling.

30:47.186 --> 30:50.989
Oh, good. Hmm, I'm sure
he'll help you a lot.

30:50.991 --> 30:53.758
Well, you know, there were
so many things left unsaid

30:53.760 --> 30:56.361
between Frank and I,
and I just...

30:56.363 --> 31:00.601
I just want Frank to tell me
if he was always faithful.

31:02.368 --> 31:05.069
Are you sure you'd really
wanna know all that, Susan?

31:05.071 --> 31:06.971
Oh, that's horrible.

31:06.973 --> 31:10.674
No, I'm not trying to be ugly,
but, uh, you know,

31:10.676 --> 31:12.546
this is all about Dallas,
isn't it?

31:13.981 --> 31:16.314
<i>You see, I can't talk
to you about anything.</i>

31:16.316 --> 31:18.849
<i>You don't like to talk about anything.
Why don't you go to therapy?</i>

31:18.851 --> 31:20.184
<i>That is not making me
feel any better.</i>

31:20.186 --> 31:22.721
<i>I'm not...
Okay, I'm sorry.</i>

31:22.723 --> 31:24.923
Let's do it to it, people,

31:24.925 --> 31:28.093
because concentration
is information,

31:28.095 --> 31:31.997
and information
is the key to success.

31:31.999 --> 31:34.035
Whoa! Ho-ho! Whoa.

31:35.034 --> 31:37.037
I just had an intense vision.

31:38.105 --> 31:41.071
If I don't get good notes today,

31:41.073 --> 31:44.177
I see a bunch of people on
the unemployment line tomorrow.

31:46.178 --> 31:49.346
You don't like this job...
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah...

31:49.348 --> 31:51.749
Too damn bad.

31:51.751 --> 31:54.055
You should have been born
with talent like me.

31:56.056 --> 31:57.888
- Got that, Larry?
- Yes, sir.

31:57.890 --> 31:59.190
- What an asshole.
- Dick.

32:01.662 --> 32:05.163
And coming
to the stage, John Lloyd!

32:23.684 --> 32:26.317
You better not fret.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.153
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:28.155 --> 32:31.423
I got something to tell you
you're not gonna like,

32:31.425 --> 32:34.392
‘cause all of us
are gonna die.

32:34.394 --> 32:38.430
But there's no reason
to be afraid.

32:38.432 --> 32:44.134
Mm-mmm. Because this
life is just a practice

32:44.136 --> 32:47.241
for a better life
that's yet to come.

32:48.407 --> 32:50.374
I've been given a gift

32:50.376 --> 32:54.115
so that I may share
that gift with you.

32:56.716 --> 33:00.186
We have, in our studio
audience today, a woman...

33:01.855 --> 33:04.088
named... Susan.

33:06.158 --> 33:09.129
And...
she had a husband...

33:10.196 --> 33:11.165
named...

33:14.934 --> 33:17.201
- Frank.
- Oh! Oh, that's me!

33:17.203 --> 33:19.740
Well, c-come on down!
Come on down.

33:24.077 --> 33:26.211
Susan,
Susan, welcome.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.846
- Welcome to the show, Susan.
- Thank you.

33:28.848 --> 33:31.281
- You seem a little nervous here.
- I feel very nervous.

33:31.283 --> 33:34.954
Uh, well, let's give Susan a big
hand, make her feel at home.

33:36.388 --> 33:38.522
Okay.
Now, Susan,

33:38.524 --> 33:41.960
- Susan, you were married to Frank?
- Mm-hmm.

33:41.962 --> 33:42.993
You lost Frank?

33:42.995 --> 33:44.194
Mm-hmm.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.830
- You loved him very, very much.
- Mm-hmm.

33:46.832 --> 33:49.032
You miss him
very, very much.

33:49.034 --> 33:50.335
- Mm.
- Yes.

33:50.337 --> 33:52.440
Well, I have news
for you, Susan.

33:53.874 --> 33:56.141
- We're gonna talk to Frank today.
- Oh.

33:56.143 --> 33:57.942
- But I need your help, okay?
- Okay.

33:57.944 --> 34:00.146
All right.
So, now, I want you to think...

34:01.380 --> 34:05.115
think about Frank,
everything about Frank.

34:05.117 --> 34:07.921
How he looked,
how he sounded,

34:09.156 --> 34:11.822
what he smelled like,
all right?

34:11.824 --> 34:13.194
Everything about Frank.

34:14.527 --> 34:16.426
I want you
to take a deep breath...

34:18.330 --> 34:20.166
and place your hands
on the orb.

34:45.024 --> 34:48.128
Susan, where are we?

34:49.594 --> 34:52.129
Frank? Is that you?

34:52.130 --> 34:55.033
Of course it is,
sweetheart.

34:55.034 --> 34:56.771
Oh, Susan. I...

34:57.504 --> 34:59.470
I miss you.

34:59.472 --> 35:00.839
I love you.

35:02.341 --> 35:03.975
Now, there is...

35:03.977 --> 35:09.080
There is something you... you
want to ask me, isn't there?

35:09.082 --> 35:11.381
About that... About
that time you called me

35:11.383 --> 35:13.283
at the hotel room
in Dallas

35:13.285 --> 35:15.520
- and a woman answered the phone.
- Yes!

35:15.522 --> 35:19.557
Well, yeah... w-why didn't
you just ask me, sweetheart?

35:19.559 --> 35:23.461
It was just the maid
cleaning up the room.

35:23.463 --> 35:26.230
<i>I never cheated on you.</i>

35:26.232 --> 35:27.598
<i>I...</i>

35:27.600 --> 35:29.500
I always loved you.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.136
I-I was a faithful,

35:32.138 --> 35:33.874
<i>faithful husband.</i>

35:50.957 --> 35:53.156
Yo, Brian,
check this shit out, dude.

35:53.158 --> 35:54.926
Turn to channel 13.

35:54.928 --> 35:57.263
I'm looking at the solution
to all our problems.

35:58.664 --> 36:00.932
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

36:00.934 --> 36:02.399
Thank you.
That's what we do!

36:02.401 --> 36:04.304
<i>That's what we do!</i>

36:11.243 --> 36:12.379
Coming!

36:15.548 --> 36:17.051
I'm comin'!

36:26.426 --> 36:28.493
Oh, my. Oh my, oh my.

36:28.495 --> 36:30.064
Hello.

36:32.665 --> 36:36.100
Well, what can I
do for you, miss?

36:36.102 --> 36:37.935
Mr. Lloyd...

36:37.937 --> 36:39.504
I'm your biggest fan
in the world,

36:39.506 --> 36:43.077
and I wonder if we could
talk for a minute?

36:44.010 --> 36:45.642
Of course.

36:45.644 --> 36:48.081
Just wait one...
one little minute.

37:05.198 --> 37:08.131
Dick on, brain off.

37:08.133 --> 37:10.701
- Never fails.
- Sh... Shit.

37:10.703 --> 37:12.669
Sorry to wake your ass up,
Mr. Lloyd,

37:12.671 --> 37:15.275
but, uh, we need a favor.

37:16.309 --> 37:18.743
Yo, I was watching your show.

37:18.745 --> 37:21.044
You was talking to
this old lady, right,

37:21.046 --> 37:23.548
and she was crying
and shit, like cryin',

37:23.550 --> 37:26.283
and asking about her husband
and, uh,

37:26.285 --> 37:28.285
oh, it was...
Dude, what's his name?

37:28.287 --> 37:29.720
- Um...
- Frank.

37:29.722 --> 37:30.721
- Frank.
- Yeah.

37:30.723 --> 37:32.423
Right. Right.

37:32.425 --> 37:34.491
That shit
was crazy, man.

37:34.493 --> 37:37.060
- And it was like all this stuff...
- Hey, hey.

37:37.062 --> 37:40.397
We just need you to kick that psychic
shit like you do every day, a'ight?

37:40.399 --> 37:43.000
Wha... What was it called when a...
when the spooks talk through ya?

37:43.002 --> 37:44.334
Channeling.

37:44.336 --> 37:47.238
Channeling. He is a
motherfuckin' professional.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.305
All right, channeling.

37:48.307 --> 37:51.109
I need you
to channel Cliff Bettis,

37:51.111 --> 37:53.111
get him to tell us
where that money at.

37:53.113 --> 37:56.080
What makes you think
that he will tell you now

37:56.082 --> 37:58.549
when he wouldn't tell you
when he was alive?

37:58.551 --> 38:00.517
‘Cause we got his
motherfuckin' bitch now, man.

38:00.519 --> 38:03.553
Shut up!
I got this, a'ight?

38:03.555 --> 38:05.059
All right.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.792
But we do got his
motherfuckin' bitch now.

38:08.794 --> 38:13.296
So I figure, look, if Ghost Cliff
don't talk, we just slay her ass.

38:13.298 --> 38:15.066
I don't have anything
to do with this!

38:15.068 --> 38:16.566
Aw, Sandra, baby.

38:16.568 --> 38:18.403
It's-It's not personal.

38:18.405 --> 38:21.408
I mean, we not monsters.
It's just business, a'ight?

38:22.408 --> 38:24.510
What if I told you...

38:26.245 --> 38:30.517
that the truth is
I cannot talk to dead people?

38:39.292 --> 38:40.327
This motherfucker.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.826
Nice try.

38:42.828 --> 38:45.296
Watch your show all the time, man.
We see what you can do.

38:45.298 --> 38:48.533
Besides, if you are a phony,

38:48.535 --> 38:52.236
I figure we just rob the place
and murder your ass, you know,

38:52.238 --> 38:53.837
so the night
won't be a total loss.

38:53.839 --> 38:55.640
Just askin'.

38:55.642 --> 38:57.107
Good question.

38:57.109 --> 39:00.211
I guess a séance is in order.

39:00.213 --> 39:02.479
Yeah, séance that shit.

39:02.481 --> 39:04.714
Okay. Uh, um...

39:04.716 --> 39:07.787
I, uh, I have to go to the
bathroom for a second.

39:28.441 --> 39:30.374
I'm so fucked.

39:30.376 --> 39:33.477
I am so fucked!

39:33.479 --> 39:35.412
I am so fucked!

39:35.414 --> 39:41.384
I am so fucked.

39:41.386 --> 39:43.720
Uh! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

39:43.722 --> 39:45.423
John! John, stop whi...
Stop whining.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.390
Stop, stop whining.

39:47.392 --> 39:49.128
Stop.

39:53.365 --> 39:57.435
You are a master showman.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.270
You fool
20 million people a week.

39:59.272 --> 40:02.372
You can sure as shit fool a bunch
of dumb-ass thugs from the hood!

40:02.374 --> 40:04.508
Now, you get out there...

40:04.510 --> 40:07.280
and you blow them
the fuck away.

40:24.564 --> 40:26.300
<i>And you call this a party?</i>

40:27.232 --> 40:28.435
<i>Could be.</i>

40:39.611 --> 40:43.814
Okay... I need you all...

40:43.816 --> 40:47.488
to concentrate on the red candles
at the center of the table.

40:49.189 --> 40:50.557
And concentrate...

40:52.258 --> 40:55.792
concentrate on the image
of Cliff's face.

40:55.794 --> 40:57.528
Look, all right, man,
we gonna do this,

40:57.530 --> 40:59.332
but, hey, but don't try
no funny shit, a'ight?

41:00.633 --> 41:02.136
I'm going to count down
from 12...

41:03.269 --> 41:05.569
and when I get
to the end,

41:05.571 --> 41:07.907
Cliff... should...

41:09.776 --> 41:11.408
possess my body.

41:11.410 --> 41:12.613
Let's do it.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.682
Twelve.

41:22.421 --> 41:23.423
Eleven.

41:27.727 --> 41:28.761
Ten.

41:30.796 --> 41:32.165
Nine.

41:33.800 --> 41:34.767
Eight.

41:36.935 --> 41:38.338
Seven.

41:39.805 --> 41:40.907
Six.

41:42.675 --> 41:43.776
Five.

41:45.410 --> 41:46.345
Four.

41:48.481 --> 41:49.783
Three.

41:51.551 --> 41:52.553
Two.

41:53.919 --> 41:54.954
One.
Oh, my God!

41:56.555 --> 41:57.921
What's going on?

41:57.923 --> 41:58.891
What's, wh...

42:07.267 --> 42:08.268
Marvin!

42:10.403 --> 42:13.437
Why the fuck you
have to strangle me, Marvin?

42:13.439 --> 42:16.573
I told you I wasn't
fuckin' nobody else.

42:16.575 --> 42:18.808
Latasha?
Oh, quit lyin', bitch.

42:18.810 --> 42:21.481
Your ass ain't nothin' but
old scandalous baldhead-ass ho!

42:24.617 --> 42:27.321
Hey, I know you.

42:27.953 --> 42:29.520
Hey, fuhgeddaboutit!

42:29.522 --> 42:32.656
You're that moolie

42:32.658 --> 42:35.026
You think
you're the new kingfish?

42:35.028 --> 42:36.493
Fuhgeddaboutit!

42:36.495 --> 42:38.562
Sammy the Shark?

42:38.564 --> 42:40.930
Wait-Wait, you-you-you

42:40.932 --> 42:41.934
You tried to cheat me!

42:45.738 --> 42:49.372
Booze, how you gonna put a knife
in your own cousin's back?

42:49.374 --> 42:51.341
Now, come on, Booze!
I...

42:51.343 --> 42:52.713
Pee-Wee? What the fuck?

42:55.414 --> 42:56.881
Gore, you're a punk!

42:56.883 --> 42:58.582
You had to shoot me
in a drive-by

42:58.584 --> 43:00.988
‘cause you were too chicken-shit
to face me straight up, huh?

43:03.689 --> 43:05.725
Well, you're the
bloody wanker who carjacked me.

43:08.827 --> 43:10.895
This fool's bringing up
every cat we ever did murder.

43:10.897 --> 43:13.330
Hey, we... we just wanna
talk to Cliff, man!

43:22.040 --> 43:25.475
I can't
believe you motherfuckers

43:25.477 --> 43:28.578
had the nerve
to bring me back.

43:28.580 --> 43:30.450
Oh, my God.

43:31.651 --> 43:34.618
Baby, is it really you?

43:34.620 --> 43:37.721
Yes, it is.

43:37.723 --> 43:40.894
And you are lookin' fine
tonight, sugar.

43:42.627 --> 43:44.595
Welcome back, nigga.

43:44.597 --> 43:45.995
Booze!
What the fuck you doin'?

43:45.997 --> 43:47.833
Shut up, nigga!
I know what I'm doin'.

43:49.535 --> 43:51.468
Now, you gonna tell us
where that money at,

43:51.470 --> 43:54.638
or I'm gonna paint the walls
with your bitch's brains. Huh?

43:54.640 --> 43:58.441
You can't do that, Booze,
cause your gun don't work.

43:58.443 --> 44:00.111
Oh, yeah?

44:00.113 --> 44:02.479
Oh, you done fucked
with the wrong nigger, huh?

44:02.481 --> 44:03.580
Come on.

44:07.720 --> 44:09.656
What the fuck?

44:11.524 --> 44:12.426
What the fuck?

44:21.934 --> 44:24.868
Ain't this a bitch?

44:24.870 --> 44:27.171
You couldn't find me
a better body

44:27.173 --> 44:29.740
than this muthafuckin'
piece of shit to get me, huh?

44:29.742 --> 44:32.442
I killed you once,

44:32.444 --> 44:35.178
I'm about to do it again with
your punk ass, motherfucker.

44:35.180 --> 44:38.616
Oh, oh, oh, uh-oh, yeah.

44:38.618 --> 44:40.417
What the fuck
is all this dancin' shit?

44:40.419 --> 44:44.421
Ever tell you what my
favorite soul group was, huh?

44:44.423 --> 44:45.823
Huh? From the '70s?

44:45.825 --> 44:47.524
What was it, baby?

44:47.526 --> 44:50.194
- The Spinners, baby.
- That's right. The Spinners.

44:50.196 --> 44:51.694
Whoo!

44:54.434 --> 44:55.635
Aw...

44:59.037 --> 45:00.136
Fuck, man!

45:00.138 --> 45:02.843
Shit.

45:05.477 --> 45:07.912
You kick their fuckin'
asses for me, Papi.

45:07.914 --> 45:10.714
- B-dog, what we gonna do?
- Nigga, I don't know!

45:10.716 --> 45:16.220
Gore, you always had
a big-ass mouth.

45:16.222 --> 45:17.390
Shut the fuck up!

45:22.227 --> 45:27.131
But people who eat glass
in glass houses

45:27.133 --> 45:29.468
shouldn't throw stones.

45:47.986 --> 45:48.954
Ugh.

45:58.698 --> 46:00.700
Oh, fuck!

46:06.671 --> 46:08.138
Damn.

46:08.140 --> 46:11.107
Somethin'
disagree with your tummy?

46:11.109 --> 46:13.209
They say it's 80 percent
what you eat, baby.

46:13.211 --> 46:15.245
That's right.

46:15.247 --> 46:17.548
- Get back, you spawn of Satan!
- Ah!

46:17.550 --> 46:19.549
In-In-In the name of Christ,
I command you!

46:19.551 --> 46:21.819
Oh, put that away!

46:21.821 --> 46:24.254
Put it away. Where'd
you get religion, boy?

46:24.256 --> 46:27.258
Since-Since Gore showed me
<i>Horror of Dracula.</i>

46:27.260 --> 46:30.093
Well, you got two problems
with that, nigga.

46:30.095 --> 46:32.595
One, you gotta have faith
for that thing to work,

46:32.597 --> 46:36.834
and two,
I ain't no vampire, fool!

46:36.836 --> 46:41.540
Next time, try watchin'
<i>The Exorcist.</i>

46:45.711 --> 46:47.076
Cliff, chill out, man!

46:47.078 --> 46:49.546
I-I ain't the one
that even killed you!

46:49.548 --> 46:51.781
That-That was Booze, man.

46:51.783 --> 46:53.950
I got this motherfucker
to bring you back, huh?

46:53.952 --> 46:55.955
Yeah, and I intend
to thank you for that.

46:56.789 --> 46:57.854
Come on now, man.

46:57.856 --> 46:59.256
You got a body now,

46:59.258 --> 47:02.026
and-and you know, he rich,
richer than a motherfucker, man.

47:02.028 --> 47:03.928
It's a famous-ass
white boy right here, man.

47:03.930 --> 47:06.062
Famous-ass nigga!

47:06.064 --> 47:08.999
Come on. You know what kind of life
you about to be pimpin' now? Huh?

47:09.001 --> 47:12.201
Shit, as far as I'm concerned, look,
you ain't got nothing to be mad about.

47:12.203 --> 47:14.039
Fuck.
That-That's a good trade.

47:15.140 --> 47:16.839
Right?

47:16.841 --> 47:18.744
Except my dick
was bigger before.

47:20.345 --> 47:23.279
Ah, man. That shit
way overrated, man.

47:23.281 --> 47:24.816
Ain't that right, Sandra?

47:28.888 --> 47:34.290
Brian, you never cared about
nobody in your life but yourself.

47:34.292 --> 47:38.227
All you cared about
is power.

47:38.229 --> 47:42.098
Well, I'm gonna give you
all the motherfuckin' power

47:42.100 --> 47:44.834
your greedy-ass heart
desires.

47:44.836 --> 47:48.040
How about 500 volts?

48:07.792 --> 48:11.629
That stinks, baby!

48:11.631 --> 48:14.832
Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

48:14.834 --> 48:16.169
Why are you
talkin' like that?

48:18.336 --> 48:20.638
I got to practice, baby.

48:20.640 --> 48:22.740
Ooh, I gots to practice.

48:23.709 --> 48:24.810
Mmm.

48:58.743 --> 49:02.314
Sit down!
Sit your ass down.

49:03.448 --> 49:04.948
All right, all right.

49:04.950 --> 49:07.950
Let's get this party started.

49:07.952 --> 49:10.386
I am the man
who gets paid,

49:10.388 --> 49:14.191
because I can really talk
to dead people.

49:14.193 --> 49:20.798
Now, which one a-you
motherfuckers wanna go first?

49:20.800 --> 49:24.638
<i>The tale has been
successfully stored in the Patriot's memory.</i>

49:26.805 --> 49:28.705
Who wants to go first?

49:28.707 --> 49:30.808
Now that's a story the
Robo-Patriot could learn from.

49:30.810 --> 49:32.776
I'm glad you liked it.

49:32.778 --> 49:34.343
I have more.

49:34.345 --> 49:35.879
Well, I hope it's as good.

49:35.881 --> 49:38.251
Um, excuse me a moment.
Excuse me, Lauren.

49:40.118 --> 49:41.919
Have you got
the progress report?

49:41.921 --> 49:44.721
He seems to be close
with his employees.

49:44.723 --> 49:47.390
He comes on to all the
women who work for him.

49:47.392 --> 49:49.028
- You too?
- Me too.

49:50.328 --> 49:54.163
But it is not why
I got the promotion.

49:54.165 --> 49:56.866
Why do you
put up with it?

49:56.868 --> 49:59.303
Because I believe
in the overall mission.

49:59.305 --> 50:00.437
American safety.

50:00.439 --> 50:03.506
Yeah, and making
a lot of money.

50:03.508 --> 50:05.408
I'm back.
Another story?

50:05.410 --> 50:07.211
Oh, ready to record.

50:07.213 --> 50:12.448
How about one that deals with
three favorite human pastimes?

50:12.450 --> 50:18.888
Sex, drugs, and this crazy
idea of bros over hos.

50:18.890 --> 50:22.292
I can't wait to hear this one.
Right, Kelly?

50:22.294 --> 50:23.196
Ah!

50:24.830 --> 50:27.901
Well, this one begins
as most modern romances do...

50:28.968 --> 50:30.901
with technology.

50:33.138 --> 50:36.406
<i>Hi, Ty. Carmen here
with my BFF, Liz.</i>

50:36.408 --> 50:38.776
<i>I told her all about you
and your buddy Kahad,</i>

50:38.778 --> 50:41.410
<i>and we're both really excited
to hook up with you.</i>

50:41.412 --> 50:44.548
<i>I texted you the address,
so we'll see you tonight.</i>

50:44.550 --> 50:46.183
- <i>Bye.</i>
- <i>Bye.</i>

50:46.185 --> 50:48.185
Mm. So, you met these
babes on Tinder?

50:48.187 --> 50:50.053
Oh, yes, I did.

50:50.055 --> 50:52.955
Well, Carmen right there, the one
on the right, I met her on Tinder.

50:52.957 --> 50:54.957
We were chattin' up
a storm, man.

50:54.959 --> 50:57.794
She asked if I had a good-looking
friend for her girl, Liz.

50:57.796 --> 50:59.196
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh!

50:59.198 --> 51:01.230
And I said no,
but I'll bring my boy Kahad.

51:01.232 --> 51:03.200
- Oh, ma... Fuck you, Ty.
- Yeah.

51:03.202 --> 51:06.002
You're lucky you're driving, 'cause I
woulda knocked your ass out just now.

51:06.004 --> 51:07.437
Would you? Yeah, tell me
that again after tonight,

51:07.439 --> 51:09.105
after you see how much
I hooked us up.

51:09.107 --> 51:10.506
These girls are smokin'.

51:10.508 --> 51:12.209
Oh, oh, okay!
All right.

51:12.211 --> 51:14.144
What did you tell them
to get 'em so hyped?

51:14.146 --> 51:16.212
I'm an agent and you're
a casting director.

51:16.214 --> 51:19.049
I can't believe
that keeps working.

51:19.051 --> 51:21.118
Like, that's not hard
to check up on at all.

51:21.120 --> 51:22.986
No, it isn't, at all.

51:22.988 --> 51:26.055
They are your typical actress,
model, wannabe singer types.

51:26.057 --> 51:27.290
It's stupid. It's easy.

51:27.292 --> 51:29.258
They're dumber than rocks,
that's what they are.

51:29.260 --> 51:32.562
Literally, and I mean, people
believe what they want to believe,

51:32.564 --> 51:35.899
they hear what they wanna hear, and I told
'em we were gonna get 'em real big parts.

51:35.901 --> 51:38.234
They gonna get
big parts all right.

51:38.236 --> 51:40.236
That's my boy.

51:40.238 --> 51:41.470
Yes!

51:41.472 --> 51:43.272
Goddamn it. You are bad.
I love it.

51:43.274 --> 51:45.609
- Can I get a amen?
- Amen!

51:45.611 --> 51:48.946
- Ooh!
- You know that!

51:53.986 --> 51:56.185
- Nice crib!
- Yeah.

51:56.187 --> 51:58.522
I thought you said
they were wannabes?

51:58.524 --> 52:00.357
Maybe they're trust fund babes.
I don't know.

52:00.359 --> 52:01.528
Let's go.

52:08.968 --> 52:10.200
Wannabes?

52:13.972 --> 52:15.104
Wow.

52:15.106 --> 52:17.174
Do you fuckin' see this?

52:17.176 --> 52:18.044
Yes!

52:33.057 --> 52:35.091
- Hi, guys! Welcome.
- Hello!

52:35.093 --> 52:37.261
- Come on in.
- Is this Mr. Kahad?

52:37.263 --> 52:39.296
- Yes, I am.
- Ooh.

52:39.298 --> 52:40.930
- Hi, baby.
- What's up, beautiful? How you doin'?

52:40.932 --> 52:43.600
So glad you're cute.
You look good.

52:43.602 --> 52:45.535
- Oh, my God. Thank you, thank you.
- Welcome to our home.

52:45.537 --> 52:49.006
- Yeah. Welcome.
- Mm, you look amazing. This is nice.

52:49.008 --> 52:51.375
- This is...
- This crib is insane.

52:51.377 --> 52:53.644
You guys can throw some
sick parties in here.

52:53.646 --> 52:57.013
- It's just y'all two livin' here?
- Yeah, it's what we're doin' right now.

52:57.015 --> 52:59.182
Mm, it only takes four
to make a party.

52:59.184 --> 53:01.151
Or three
if you're naughty.

53:01.153 --> 53:03.319
Mm.
I like that.

53:03.321 --> 53:04.921
- I wanna be naughty.
- Yeah?

53:04.923 --> 53:06.156
Yeah, I do.

53:06.158 --> 53:07.524
- You wanna be naughty with me?
- Mm-hmm.

53:07.526 --> 53:10.093
Hey, here's a crazy idea.

53:10.095 --> 53:13.263
You guys wanna play
a little game?

53:18.671 --> 53:22.071
"I've got 99 problems,
but blank ain't one."

53:22.073 --> 53:23.205
- All right.
- Okay.

53:23.207 --> 53:24.408
- Five.
- Whoa, whoa!

53:24.410 --> 53:26.709
- Four, three.
- You're going fast here.

53:26.711 --> 53:27.977
- Two.
- Okay, okay, okay.

53:27.979 --> 53:29.946
One!

53:29.948 --> 53:34.051
Okay, okay. What
do we have here?

53:34.053 --> 53:36.118
Okay, Ty.

53:36.120 --> 53:40.290
"I've got 99 problems,
but The Chronic ain't one."

53:40.292 --> 53:43.192
The Chronic, ladies. Come on, right?
Am I right?

53:43.194 --> 53:45.194
- Mm...
- That's who she thought was gonna win?

53:45.196 --> 53:48.298
- You can just hand me the card, man.
- Agree to disagree?

53:48.300 --> 53:50.734
- I don't know about that.
- Agree to disagree.

53:50.736 --> 53:52.201
Uh, Carmen.

53:52.203 --> 53:56.006
"I've got 99 problems,
but smegma ain't one."

53:56.008 --> 53:57.274
- Oh, my...
- That's right.

53:57.276 --> 53:58.575
- That is so...
- I'm done.

53:58.577 --> 54:00.711
What in the world
is smegma?

54:00.713 --> 54:01.979
I'll show ya later.

54:01.981 --> 54:03.046
- Ew!
- What?

54:03.048 --> 54:05.314
Nasty.

54:05.316 --> 54:11.421
And Liz, "I've got 99 problems, but
doin' the right thing ain't one."

54:11.423 --> 54:14.390
- No, it ain't.
- You better watch it. You better get your friend.

54:14.392 --> 54:16.759
That's my girl. Own it, baby.
Own it.

54:16.761 --> 54:19.698
And this round goes to...

54:21.232 --> 54:23.299
- Liz.
- Ooh-hoo!

54:23.301 --> 54:24.600
This is rigged.
This game...

54:24.602 --> 54:25.669
- That's messed up.
- I'm done.

54:25.671 --> 54:27.370
Stop hatin'.

54:27.372 --> 54:28.437
- All I got left... I don't like all that.
- Stop, stop hatin'.

54:28.439 --> 54:29.506
All right, all right, all right.

54:29.508 --> 54:31.073
Settle, children.
Settle.

54:32.477 --> 54:35.212
"A recent
laboratory study shows

54:35.214 --> 54:38.482
that undergraduates
have 50 percent less sex

54:38.484 --> 54:42.285
after being exposed to..."
Five...

54:42.287 --> 54:43.620
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Four...

54:43.622 --> 54:45.022
- Oh, whoa, shit, um...
- Three...

54:45.024 --> 54:45.788
- Ooh, girl.
- Two...

54:45.790 --> 54:47.491
- Um, okay.
- One...

54:47.493 --> 54:50.359
I'm in.
I'm in.

54:50.361 --> 54:51.660
All right.

54:51.662 --> 54:54.163
"A recent
laboratory study shows

54:54.165 --> 54:56.732

54:59.405 --> 55:01.437
Ooh...
"Coat hanger abortion."

55:01.439 --> 55:02.772
Oh, dude.

55:02.774 --> 55:05.642
Oh, don't act like
that's too far.

55:05.644 --> 55:07.778
- All right. Kahad.
- Mm-hmm.

55:07.780 --> 55:09.645

55:19.258 --> 55:21.191
That should get you more play
if you're doin' it right, babe.

55:21.193 --> 55:22.325
That was it.
That was it.

55:22.327 --> 55:24.093
- I'll give you that.
- That was a good one.

55:24.095 --> 55:25.328
Some people like that.

55:25.330 --> 55:27.363
- My girl, Carmen.
- Yes, baby.

55:27.365 --> 55:31.401
"A recent laboratory study shows that

55:36.374 --> 55:38.375
- Ooh!
- Why are you pointing this way?

55:38.377 --> 55:40.576
- Itty-bitty!
- Kahad, you got your feelings hurt just now, man?

55:40.578 --> 55:42.511
- Wait, why are... Don't... Hey.
- Super defensive.

55:42.513 --> 55:44.848
- Ooh!
- Don't say that too loud, you're gonna hurt Kahad's feelings.

55:44.850 --> 55:46.482
- Hey, once you go this way...
- First smegma.

55:46.484 --> 55:48.285
- Now micro-penis...
- You ain't goin' back, all right?

55:48.287 --> 55:52.392
We'll see, honey.
And the winner is...

55:53.559 --> 55:55.792
- my girl, Carmen.
- Oh, yes!

55:55.794 --> 55:58.595
- Wait, that beat "bleached assholes"?
- This is rigged.

55:58.597 --> 56:00.397
- Afraid so.
- Yeah, that beat "bleached"...

56:00.399 --> 56:01.564
- Really?
- They're kickin' our ass.

56:01.566 --> 56:03.600
- Super defensive.
- Getting really defensive.

56:03.602 --> 56:04.636
So defensive!

56:11.310 --> 56:14.280
So, uh, Ty tells me
you cast a lot of blockbusters.

56:15.580 --> 56:18.180
What's it like
to work with Marvel?

56:18.182 --> 56:23.752
Um, well, they're really open
to all of my opinions.

56:23.754 --> 56:28.325
In fact, I'm the one who suggested
Chris Pratt for <i>Guardians.</i>

56:28.327 --> 56:31.328
- Wow! That's very cool.
- Mm-hmm.

56:31.330 --> 56:33.763
I have a fourth eye
for spottin' talent.

56:33.765 --> 56:36.332
My third eye's for spottin'
beautiful women like you two.

56:38.202 --> 56:42.538
All right, ladies. After a performance
like that, you deserve a drink.

56:42.540 --> 56:45.278
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

56:47.412 --> 56:49.513
All right,
let's make a toast.

56:49.515 --> 56:52.915
To hot sweaty nights
spent howling at the moon.

56:52.917 --> 56:54.651
I like that.

56:59.290 --> 57:00.589
Ooh!

57:00.591 --> 57:01.725
- Ah.
- Mm.

57:01.727 --> 57:03.660
Mine tastes kinda funny.

57:03.662 --> 57:04.597
Mine too.

57:37.396 --> 57:40.763
Goddamn, these babes
are gorgeous.

57:40.765 --> 57:43.299
- Mm.
- Oh, my God. I want the one with the curly hair.

57:43.301 --> 57:45.267
All right,
don't get ahead of yourself,

57:45.269 --> 57:47.437
‘cause I'm-a have both first, and then
you gonna have your turn, all right?

57:47.439 --> 57:48.971
Wait, no. I'm not about to
have your sloppy seconds.

57:48.973 --> 57:50.973
Dude, that's
all you ever get.

57:50.975 --> 57:53.276
Oh-oh, okay. Okay.
So that's what we gonna do?

57:53.278 --> 57:54.778
- We gonna flip a coin, okay?
- Okay.

57:54.780 --> 57:56.546
That's what we gonna do.
Mm-mmm.

57:56.548 --> 57:59.482
I have been in a room just like
this before with that chick Ilsa.

57:59.484 --> 58:00.783
Uh-huh.

58:00.785 --> 58:03.220
I bet you these girls
are into bondage and BDSM

58:03.222 --> 58:04.220
and all sorts
of freaky shit.

58:04.222 --> 58:05.788
They probably like
what we're about to do to 'em.

58:05.790 --> 58:07.924
Oh, well,
maybe we should look around,

58:07.926 --> 58:09.692
find their
whips and chains.

58:09.694 --> 58:14.698
Damn, Kahad. What kind of man ties
up and beats unconscious women?

58:14.700 --> 58:17.500
You need to look at yourself.
I'm just sayin'.

58:17.502 --> 58:19.935
- Dang, you're right.
- Yeah.

58:19.937 --> 58:23.006
It is kinda sick, isn't it?
We should just fuck 'em.

58:24.676 --> 58:26.779
That's my boy right there.
Show some class.

58:28.946 --> 58:30.546
Oh, all right.
Look, look.

58:30.548 --> 58:32.549
I want you to frame in,
focus on her tits,

58:32.551 --> 58:34.250
and then we're gonna
pan over right here.

58:34.252 --> 58:36.519
No, what I want you to do is
not tell me how to do my job.

58:36.521 --> 58:38.388
- Kahad... Kahad...
- I'm the director here, okay?

58:38.390 --> 58:39.923
Focus on the tits,
all right?

58:39.925 --> 58:41.491
Okay, okay.

58:41.493 --> 58:43.259
Goddamn it.

58:43.261 --> 58:46.363
- Crazy. All right, man. We are...
- God.

58:46.365 --> 58:47.732
...set.

58:48.899 --> 58:50.403
We ready?

58:51.502 --> 58:52.801
Um...

58:52.803 --> 58:54.839
It... I don't know.
It's... I don't know.

59:01.879 --> 59:03.479
- What did you do?
- I-I...

59:03.481 --> 59:04.647
- It's broken...
- I didn't do nothin'.

59:04.649 --> 59:06.015
Same thing I've been
doing the past several...

59:06.017 --> 59:07.953
Okay. I'm gonna... Watch.
I'm gonna fix it.

59:28.640 --> 59:30.506
They're vampires. Vampires.

59:30.508 --> 59:32.075
No. Bullshit!

59:32.077 --> 59:33.613
These bitches must
think it's Halloween.

59:34.780 --> 59:37.046
Trick or treat.

59:37.048 --> 59:38.814
Trick or treat.

59:38.816 --> 59:42.519
Give us
something warm to drink.

59:44.589 --> 59:46.459
- Bring it the fuck on!
- Yeah, come on!

59:48.526 --> 59:50.428
Ah!

59:53.932 --> 59:55.999
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Get up!

59:56.001 --> 59:58.100
Get up, Ty!
Get up! Let's go!

59:58.102 --> 01:00:00.102
- Go, go, go!
- I'm going!

01:00:00.104 --> 01:00:02.071
Let's get the fuck
outta here!

01:00:02.073 --> 01:00:03.406
Oh, sh...

01:00:08.814 --> 01:00:10.379
No, get off!
Get off!

01:00:37.376 --> 01:00:39.642
What is this?
What is this?

01:00:39.644 --> 01:00:41.444
Oh, shit!
Where the hell are we?

01:00:41.446 --> 01:00:44.781
And what the fuck are those guys?
What the fuck?

01:00:44.783 --> 01:00:46.515
I don't know,
but I don't wanna find out.

01:00:46.517 --> 01:00:47.917
Let's get outta here.

01:00:47.919 --> 01:00:49.685
I'm not feelin'
too good at all, man.

01:00:49.687 --> 01:00:51.453
Ah! Me neither, man.

01:00:51.455 --> 01:00:54.424
Those bitches practically
drained us dry.

01:00:54.426 --> 01:00:56.392
<i>We thought you
two would never wake up.</i>

01:00:56.394 --> 01:00:57.926
Why are you doing this to us?
What do you want?

01:00:57.928 --> 01:01:00.162
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

01:01:00.164 --> 01:01:04.767
<i>We're a pair of predators who do our
hunting on the Internet just like you.</i>

01:01:04.769 --> 01:01:06.502
Ah, fuck!

01:01:06.504 --> 01:01:08.470
<i>Oh, but most
of our stud-morsels</i>

01:01:08.472 --> 01:01:10.707
<i>have the good manners
to shrivel up and die...</i>

01:01:11.943 --> 01:01:13.977
<i>...after we feed.</i>

01:01:13.979 --> 01:01:19.749
<i>But some turn, and we can't just
let them run loose in the streets.</i>

01:01:19.751 --> 01:01:22.618
<i>It wouldn't be very...
discreet.</i>

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:27.624
<i>So, we keep them locked down
here, starving with blood lust.</i>

01:01:32.696 --> 01:01:37.500
<i>It would be sad if they hadn't all
been such rotten little fuckers.</i>

01:01:37.502 --> 01:01:40.870
Look, look. We will not
tell anybody! Anybody!

01:01:40.872 --> 01:01:42.872
- Just let us go, okay?
- Christ, man.

01:01:42.874 --> 01:01:44.774
- Just let us fucking go.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:01:44.776 --> 01:01:47.176
Shut the fuck up, man!

01:01:47.178 --> 01:01:50.180
<i>We like to give them
the leftovers.</i>

01:01:50.182 --> 01:01:53.116
- Stop, no! No! Do not do this! Please...
- Please don't do this!

01:01:55.553 --> 01:01:57.153
No, no, no, no!

01:01:58.457 --> 01:02:01.691
- No! No! No! Ah!
- Oh, God!

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:07.464
No! No! Get off of me!

01:02:07.466 --> 01:02:10.066
Oh! Oh, no! Ah! Ah!

01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:15.571
Help me, please! Help!

01:02:21.213 --> 01:02:24.580
<i>The tale has been
successfully stored in the Patriot's memory.</i>

01:02:24.582 --> 01:02:26.115
Poor bastards.

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:27.019
Really?

01:02:29.086 --> 01:02:32.590
Sounds like the Robo-Patriot
won't be going after rapists.

01:02:33.258 --> 01:02:35.558
Like hell it won't.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:39.127
You do understand that
aliens crossing our borders,

01:02:39.129 --> 01:02:41.230
so many of
them criminals, rapists.

01:02:41.232 --> 01:02:44.734
We are providing
the answer.

01:02:44.736 --> 01:02:48.238
- But those young guys? Hormones.
- Hmm.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.607
Boys will be boys. I mean,
they have to be to become men.

01:02:51.609 --> 01:02:52.808
Am I right, Grant?

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.448
Yeah, b-boys have to
become men, right?

01:02:56.548 --> 01:02:58.651
You agree, Kelly?

01:03:02.787 --> 01:03:04.620
Here's the thing.

01:03:04.622 --> 01:03:08.726
Some women, far from virtuous,
if you get my meaning.

01:03:09.693 --> 01:03:11.961
Yes, virtue.

01:03:11.963 --> 01:03:15.098
Yeah, yeah,
and anyone who says

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:20.870
that all women are bastions of
virtue don't understand shit.

01:03:22.874 --> 01:03:25.140
The shit!

01:03:25.142 --> 01:03:30.115
No, Mr. Beach,
they do not understand the shit!

01:03:31.649 --> 01:03:36.752
They do not understand
the shit at all.

01:03:36.754 --> 01:03:41.493
In fact, no one really
understands the shit.

01:03:48.133 --> 01:03:49.835
Do we have time
for another tale?

01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:16.962
Stay back here, boy.

01:04:57.334 --> 01:04:58.937
You got two boys
from Chicago here?

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.741
Yes, sir.

01:05:05.743 --> 01:05:07.812
I want the one that did
all the talking down in Money.

01:05:14.752 --> 01:05:15.687
Yes, sir.

01:05:21.993 --> 01:05:23.292
Better turn on some lights,
preacher.

01:05:24.662 --> 01:05:27.231
Can't, sir.
Electricity's out.

01:05:48.687 --> 01:05:50.356
You the nigger
who did the talkin'?

01:05:56.861 --> 01:05:57.830
Yeah.

01:06:02.133 --> 01:06:05.870
Mm-hmm.
Don't you "yeah" me, boy.

01:06:07.738 --> 01:06:09.140
I'll blow your head off.

01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:12.110
Put your clothes on.

01:06:18.216 --> 01:06:19.385
You gonna do
what I said, boy?

01:06:25.323 --> 01:06:27.457
You okay?
Our baby kicking?

01:06:27.459 --> 01:06:28.727
It was that boy again.

01:06:30.127 --> 01:06:32.895
Emily, it's just a dream.
We talked about this.

01:06:32.897 --> 01:06:35.064
He's not sure
we deserve this baby.

01:06:35.066 --> 01:06:38.868
What?
Of course we deserve it.

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.770
Baby, I have this feeling
he wants to take it away.

01:06:41.772 --> 01:06:44.339
This time
will be different.

01:06:44.341 --> 01:06:46.241
What did Dr. Gwinett say
at your last visit?

01:06:46.243 --> 01:06:50.312
- "Everything looks fine."
- That was last week.

01:06:50.314 --> 01:06:54.984
Well, I'll give him a call to come
over first thing tomorrow, okay?

01:06:54.986 --> 01:06:59.421
Now, I just want you to close
your eyes, clear your mind,

01:06:59.423 --> 01:07:02.024
think about how beautiful
this baby is gonna be.

01:07:02.026 --> 01:07:03.796
Go back to sleep.

01:07:04.828 --> 01:07:06.796
No.

01:07:06.798 --> 01:07:08.801
No, he'll just be there
waiting for me.

01:07:12.035 --> 01:07:13.037
And then...

01:07:17.274 --> 01:07:19.977
He's gonna be here.

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.147
Emily, get back in bed.

01:07:29.453 --> 01:07:33.057
Please! Just leave him!

01:07:34.859 --> 01:07:35.994
Please.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:42.468
Just leave him! Please.

01:07:43.368 --> 01:07:44.901
Can't you just leave him?

01:07:44.903 --> 01:07:46.968
He ain't got good sense.

01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:48.473
He didn't know
what he was doin'.

01:07:49.307 --> 01:07:50.475
Don't take him.

01:07:51.843 --> 01:07:53.408
Just your shoes.

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:55.079
I don't wear shoes
without socks.

01:07:56.881 --> 01:07:58.214
Please.

01:07:58.216 --> 01:08:02.084
I will pay you gentlemen
for whatever damages

01:08:02.086 --> 01:08:04.089
if you will
just leave him here.

01:08:06.925 --> 01:08:08.227
How much you got?

01:08:14.833 --> 01:08:16.201
You best be
gettin' back to bed.

01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:20.502
And I mean,
I wanna hear springs.

01:08:20.504 --> 01:08:22.540
In fact, all you niggers
need to go back to sleep.

01:08:47.464 --> 01:08:48.930
You know anybody here?

01:08:48.932 --> 01:08:51.435
No, sir.
I don't know you.

01:08:53.636 --> 01:08:56.205
How old are you?

01:08:56.207 --> 01:08:59.108
Sixty-four.

01:08:59.109 --> 01:09:02.413
Well, if tomorrow you decide you know somebody
here, you're not gonna live to be 65.

01:09:03.412 --> 01:09:05.015
Now get inside...

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:08.053
if you want to live
to see another sunrise.

01:09:28.971 --> 01:09:30.542
Well, it happened again
last night.

01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:34.578
Well, I-I tried that, but...

01:09:36.647 --> 01:09:38.050
Okay.

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:44.185
Yeah, I... I appreciate it.
Whatever you can do.

01:09:44.187 --> 01:09:46.087
A-As soon as you can get here.

01:09:46.089 --> 01:09:47.859
Thank you.

01:10:09.713 --> 01:10:12.148
How is she?
How's Emily?

01:10:12.150 --> 01:10:15.318
Well, she finally went to sleep. I just got off
the phone with Dr. Gwinett. He's on his way.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.287
You know I don't think all this
activity is doing her any good.

01:10:19.289 --> 01:10:20.956
Mama, let's not
do this today, okay?

01:10:20.958 --> 01:10:24.093
I told you she doesn't need
to be worrying about a campaign.

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:26.362
You wouldn't be saying that if I was
throwin' support behind Jenkins.

01:10:26.364 --> 01:10:27.863
- It's only because it's Cotton.
- True.

01:10:27.865 --> 01:10:32.568
I don't understand you supporting a
race-baiting bastard like William Cotton.

01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:37.173
But no matter who it was, I would be
saying something, because she needs rest.

01:10:37.175 --> 01:10:39.274
- You remember last year.
- Yeah, I remember.

01:10:39.276 --> 01:10:41.577
I was there in the room.

01:10:41.579 --> 01:10:44.380
I'm just saying, another
loss will destroy her.

01:10:44.382 --> 01:10:46.618
You don't think I realize that?
You don't think I care?

01:10:48.552 --> 01:10:51.122
Well, you must got a pretty
low opinion about your son.

01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:54.991
For God sakes, Mama,
it was my child too!

01:10:54.993 --> 01:10:56.928
Then damn it, Henry,
act like it.

01:11:26.257 --> 01:11:27.392
If I were you...

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.029
I'd apologize
to Mr. Bryant.

01:11:36.199 --> 01:11:38.069
Maybe you'd get off with
just a bit of a beatin'.

01:11:42.406 --> 01:11:46.742
If you cared about your child's
future, your wife's, or my future,

01:11:46.744 --> 01:11:49.277
you wouldn't be
supporting Cotton.

01:11:49.279 --> 01:11:52.113
That man wants to close down
ten more voting locations,

01:11:52.115 --> 01:11:54.050
all of them
in black districts.

01:11:54.052 --> 01:11:56.684
No, no, no, all in Democratic
districts, and I'm a Republican.

01:11:56.686 --> 01:11:59.388
- Why you putting race into it?
- "Putting"?

01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:03.358
He's purposely making it harder
for black people to vote.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.162
- Race is already in it.
- No, it doesn't have to be.

01:12:07.164 --> 01:12:10.532
You and Daddy raised me to work
hard, get ahead, and beat the odds.

01:12:10.534 --> 01:12:13.068
Daddy said singles
don't mean a damn thing.

01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:15.371
Black man's gotta hit a home
run if he wants to score,

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:17.372
and that's
what I'm doing.

01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:19.675
Not everybody
can hit a home run.

01:12:19.677 --> 01:12:22.143
I bet William Cotton and every
one of those racist fools

01:12:22.145 --> 01:12:24.145
he appeals to
can't hit one either.

01:12:24.147 --> 01:12:25.747
William Cotton's
about to be governor.

01:12:25.749 --> 01:12:27.616
That's a home run.

01:12:27.618 --> 01:12:30.286
It is not a home run when
you're born on third base.

01:12:30.288 --> 01:12:32.420
Oh, Mama.

01:12:32.422 --> 01:12:34.091
What the hell is she doin'?

01:12:35.293 --> 01:12:36.528
Emily?

01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:42.331
Emily, shouldn't you stay in bed
until Dr. Gwinett gets here?

01:12:42.333 --> 01:12:44.300
He's having doubts.

01:12:44.302 --> 01:12:46.102
Who's having doubts?
About what?

01:12:46.104 --> 01:12:49.804
The boy. He's having
doubts about dying.

01:12:49.806 --> 01:12:52.108
And if he doesn't die, he's gonna
come right out of those woods.

01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:53.541
- I need to...
- No, no, no.

01:12:53.543 --> 01:12:55.643
- Nobody's gonna take our baby, okay?
- I do feel a presence.

01:12:55.645 --> 01:12:58.313
Mama, please! Stop!

01:12:58.315 --> 01:13:01.149
Can't you see
she's wound up enough?

01:13:01.151 --> 01:13:04.252
Now, listen,
both of you.

01:13:04.254 --> 01:13:07.825
Nobody's out there, and no one's
gonna touch our baby, all right?

01:13:09.627 --> 01:13:11.426
Let's go back inside.

01:13:11.428 --> 01:13:13.161
Dr. Gwinett'll be here
in a minute.

01:13:13.163 --> 01:13:14.598
Come on.
It's okay.

01:13:27.912 --> 01:13:30.446
Emily, the baby
seems to be just fine.

01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:32.680
- You're sure?
- Yes.

01:13:32.682 --> 01:13:36.719
But do yourself and your baby
a favor and stay in bed.

01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:40.355
And if things aren't better by
tomorrow, you come by my office.

01:13:40.357 --> 01:13:42.427
- Good?
- Yeah.

01:13:44.294 --> 01:13:46.261
- Keep an eye on her.
- Okay.

01:13:46.263 --> 01:13:48.163
What about the dreams?

01:13:48.165 --> 01:13:52.835
Pregnancy can do odd things
with body chemistry, hormones.

01:13:52.837 --> 01:13:54.636
They're just dreams.

01:13:54.638 --> 01:13:56.705
Like I used to tell
my children,

01:13:56.707 --> 01:13:59.241
think of something really
wonderful as you drift off.

01:13:59.243 --> 01:14:01.279
That often does the trick.

01:14:05.716 --> 01:14:08.651
So you mean, she shouldn't even come
downstairs for the fund-raiser this evening?

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:11.189
I'm telling you,
she shouldn't leave that bed.

01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:16.825
- All right. Thanks, Martin.
- Anytime, Henry.

01:14:16.827 --> 01:14:19.396
You think Dr. Gwinett
is right, Mama Bradley?

01:14:21.298 --> 01:14:22.501
I just need
to think good thoughts?

01:14:23.801 --> 01:14:27.205
I don't know,
but I know someone who might.

01:14:28.838 --> 01:14:30.605
Mama, where you goin'?

01:14:30.607 --> 01:14:32.774
I need you to stay with Emily while
I deal with this fund-raiser.

01:14:32.776 --> 01:14:34.843
You watch her until I get back.

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:37.246
And to hell
with that damn fund-raiser!

01:15:00.837 --> 01:15:02.537
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

01:15:02.539 --> 01:15:04.907
Thank you, sir.

01:15:04.909 --> 01:15:07.412
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could
have your attention, please.

01:15:08.846 --> 01:15:11.246
First of all, we'd like
to thank you for coming out.

01:15:11.248 --> 01:15:13.983
But for now, I want to
introduce the man of the hour,

01:15:13.985 --> 01:15:16.888
Mayor, soon to be governor,
William Cotton.

01:15:18.655 --> 01:15:19.721
- Thank you, Henry.
- Yes, sir.

01:15:19.723 --> 01:15:21.624
Appreciate that.

01:15:21.626 --> 01:15:24.760
Thank you very much.
Appreciate you coming out.

01:15:24.762 --> 01:15:27.528
I'd like to thank Henry
again for this fine event

01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:30.799
at this beautiful fabulous
home he's got here.

01:15:30.801 --> 01:15:32.404
What a place.
What a place.

01:15:33.570 --> 01:15:35.536
And take a look at this.

01:15:35.538 --> 01:15:37.572
Takes you back in time,
doesn't it?

01:15:37.574 --> 01:15:39.410
Goes well
with my campaign slogan.

01:15:41.345 --> 01:15:43.778
"Let's take Mississippi back"

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.348
to the core values we've always
had here in the South.

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.422
And to have
a man like Henry...

01:15:52.455 --> 01:15:55.560
who, in his past, would have
been serving this party...

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.725
instead of hosting it.

01:15:59.829 --> 01:16:04.599
Anyway, anyway, now Henry
has this fine plantation home.

01:16:04.601 --> 01:16:09.037
And a very fine, and a very white wife, as I recall.

01:16:09.039 --> 01:16:11.307
- Where is she, anyway, Henry?
- Ah, she's feeling a little tired, sir.

01:16:11.309 --> 01:16:12.610
The pregnancy and all.

01:16:13.843 --> 01:16:18.046
Well, we'll let
that little lady rest.

01:16:18.048 --> 01:16:21.752
I imagine it's big work carrying
around all that extra weight.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.888
It makes me glad I got
an outie instead of a innie,

01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:28.057
if you catch
my meaning.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:34.063
The thing is... thing is, Henry,
his beautiful white wife,

01:16:34.065 --> 01:16:36.665
this fine home,

01:16:36.667 --> 01:16:42.374
only goes to prove that we have moved
past all that racial rigmarole.

01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:48.613
Times have changed, my friends.
Times have changed.

01:17:11.769 --> 01:17:13.038
Hmm.

01:17:37.595 --> 01:17:38.930
Get on the post, boy.

01:17:44.735 --> 01:17:46.338
I've got him.
I've got him.

01:17:51.574 --> 01:17:55.710
Now, boy, you ain't
got the right

01:17:55.712 --> 01:17:58.682
to half look
at a white woman...

01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:04.085
much less whistle at one.

01:18:04.087 --> 01:18:06.690
- I do all the time back home.
- Well, you ain't back home.

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:11.428
Down here, niggers gonna respect
a white man and his woman.

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:17.369
I'm not respecting anyone
that's not respecting me.

01:18:19.736 --> 01:18:21.502
And that's all
there is to that.

01:18:21.504 --> 01:18:24.706
Chicago, would you
please apologize to the man

01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:26.175
so maybe he
take it easy on you?

01:18:26.177 --> 01:18:29.745
- You shut up, boy!
- That's right, boy!

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:33.551
I don't need one nigger tellin'
another nigger how to obey me.

01:18:35.886 --> 01:18:37.756
I can do that on my own.

01:18:40.024 --> 01:18:43.128
Them that want to get ahead can get ahead.
Them that want to vote...

01:18:45.128 --> 01:18:48.130
can get their lazy ass off the sofa
they bought with a welfare check.

01:18:48.132 --> 01:18:52.233
- Yeah.
- Sign up for an ID, and go to a voting booth!

01:18:52.235 --> 01:18:54.702
On a proper weekday to vote!

01:18:54.704 --> 01:18:59.808
Closing a few polling locations does not mean
that we're trying to keep the blacks from voting.

01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:01.076
No, sir.

01:19:01.078 --> 01:19:03.711
We just trying
to be efficient.

01:19:03.713 --> 01:19:06.247
After all, we're all
in the same party, right?

01:19:06.249 --> 01:19:08.752
- Indeed we are, sir.
- It doesn't have to be about race...

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.587
when it can be about money.

01:19:12.589 --> 01:19:14.622
And I'm-a take all your money
here tonight...

01:19:16.793 --> 01:19:18.693
to ensure our victory
in the fall

01:19:18.695 --> 01:19:23.534
so we can take Mississippi back to the
values that made this state great.

01:19:27.704 --> 01:19:29.670
I don't know what kind of poison
they feedin' niggers up north

01:19:29.672 --> 01:19:30.809
to make 'em act
the way you do.

01:19:35.745 --> 01:19:38.546
But down here,

01:19:38.548 --> 01:19:41.653
you're either gonna be a good
nigger or a dead nigger.

01:19:47.591 --> 01:19:49.928
I'll die like a man
before I live like a nigger.

01:19:50.628 --> 01:19:52.530
You uppity...

01:20:00.904 --> 01:20:02.573
You sure that's the way
you want it, boy?

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:04.542
I'm a reasonable man.

01:20:08.177 --> 01:20:09.948
I ain't ever beat
no nigger before.

01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:18.690
So I'm gonna give you
one more chance...

01:20:20.257 --> 01:20:21.693
to make the right decision.

01:20:28.065 --> 01:20:31.198
Rousing speech, sir.
I see a lot of checkbooks open.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.135
Yeah, money's important, Henry.

01:20:34.137 --> 01:20:36.837
But not near as important
as you remembering

01:20:36.839 --> 01:20:41.009
how to vote on closing those
polling locations, councilman.

01:20:41.011 --> 01:20:43.010
Now, we need you
to get out front,

01:20:43.012 --> 01:20:46.180
take some of the heat off of
your less civic-minded relative.

01:20:46.182 --> 01:20:49.785
Now, you do that,
and I'll see to it

01:20:49.787 --> 01:20:51.920
that you get
the Mayor's office

01:20:51.922 --> 01:20:55.823
when I get
the Governor's mansion.

01:20:55.825 --> 01:20:57.125
- I'm honored, sir.
- He's going to live!

01:20:57.127 --> 01:20:59.327
- Emily!
- Hold on, hold on.

01:20:59.329 --> 01:21:01.729
We all know what happened last time.
It'll be all right.

01:21:01.731 --> 01:21:04.265
Henry,
he's decided to live.

01:21:04.267 --> 01:21:07.169
Emily, we all happy to know
your baby done decided to live.

01:21:07.171 --> 01:21:10.138
That boy from the fields
has decided to live,

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:12.142
and if he does,
it will kill this baby.

01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:14.279
Emily!

01:21:17.914 --> 01:21:19.050
Emily!

01:21:20.016 --> 01:21:21.249
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

01:21:21.251 --> 01:21:23.751
No, he's out there.
He's in that field.

01:21:23.753 --> 01:21:26.054
Now I will kill him.
I'll kill him myself.

01:21:26.056 --> 01:21:28.090
Emily!

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:31.195
I see you!

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.799
He's right...
He's right there, Henry.

01:21:37.801 --> 01:21:40.368
- Emily, there's nobody there.
- He is killing our baby.

01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:42.103
Please, sweetie.
Just put down the knife.

01:21:42.105 --> 01:21:43.772
- The baby's fine.
- No, Henry, look.

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:45.941
No!

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:51.179
See? It's getting smaller.
He's killing our baby.

01:21:51.181 --> 01:21:53.851
- There's no one there.
- You go back and die!

01:21:57.354 --> 01:21:58.323
What?

01:21:59.656 --> 01:22:00.956
- No. No. No, Henry...
- Please.

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:02.224
- He's there! He has to die!
- No.

01:22:02.226 --> 01:22:03.925
- No, he has to die!
- Come on in, please.

01:22:03.927 --> 01:22:06.664
- He has to die!
- It's all right. Just come inside.

01:22:10.167 --> 01:22:11.666
Thanks for nothin', Mama.

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.875
Give us a minute.

01:22:22.846 --> 01:22:23.982
Emmett?

01:22:35.726 --> 01:22:38.026
I brought up some tea
and a little fruit.

01:22:38.028 --> 01:22:39.861
He can see him,
can't he?

01:22:39.863 --> 01:22:41.862
He ought to see something.
He's been out there all night.

01:22:41.864 --> 01:22:44.001
- I do believe he can.
- I knew it.

01:22:45.468 --> 01:22:46.703
You good?

01:22:49.707 --> 01:22:52.073
I can't believe you brought
that crazy voodoo man over here.

01:22:52.075 --> 01:22:54.175
Made me look like a damn fool
in front of everybody.

01:22:54.177 --> 01:22:57.845
Well, I'm glad to see you've
kept your priorities straight.

01:22:57.847 --> 01:22:59.947
Anyway, you've been lookin'
like a fool for months.

01:22:59.949 --> 01:23:02.149
Mama, not every black person
has to vote the same way.

01:23:02.151 --> 01:23:04.085
Some of us think
for ourselves.

01:23:04.087 --> 01:23:06.353
And some of you only
think <i>about</i> yourselves.

01:23:06.355 --> 01:23:09.057
More important to get
into office than do something.

01:23:09.059 --> 01:23:11.093
Well, we don't have to worry
about that after tonight.

01:23:11.095 --> 01:23:12.460
Thank you.

01:23:12.462 --> 01:23:13.997
- Did you see him?
- Yeah.

01:23:15.431 --> 01:23:16.400
And?

01:23:17.434 --> 01:23:19.233
He want to talk to you.

01:23:19.235 --> 01:23:21.435
What? I'm not playing along
with this BS...

01:23:21.437 --> 01:23:22.739
Henry, talk to him!

01:23:23.906 --> 01:23:25.273
I don't want to lose
another baby.

01:23:25.275 --> 01:23:30.010
- And you won't.
- Wrong. You gonna lose more than that.

01:23:30.012 --> 01:23:33.081
You're gonna lose everything
unless you talk to him.

01:23:33.083 --> 01:23:35.149
And what do I talk to this
invisible man about, huh?

01:23:35.151 --> 01:23:37.184
- Sacrifice.
- Sacrifice.

01:23:37.186 --> 01:23:39.153
He doesn't think
you worth dying for.

01:23:39.155 --> 01:23:40.354
Who the hell
asked him to?

01:23:40.356 --> 01:23:44.059
Jesus! Y'all got me talking like
somebody's really out there.

01:23:44.061 --> 01:23:47.496
He said that a black man
votin' to close the polls

01:23:47.498 --> 01:23:51.198
to keep other black folks
from voting... last straw.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.468
What?
Are you serious?

01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:55.970
So you conjure up this nonsense
to get me to change my vote?

01:23:55.972 --> 01:23:57.304
- I didn't make him say that...
- Unbelievable!

01:23:57.306 --> 01:24:00.343
Henry! It's getting smaller.

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:04.449
I'm calling Dr. Gwinett.

01:24:07.885 --> 01:24:11.185
Can't nothing good happen now...
unless he talk.

01:24:11.187 --> 01:24:12.824
Can I talk to him?

01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:15.158
It couldn't hurt.

01:24:28.337 --> 01:24:30.171
Hey, Martin.

01:24:30.173 --> 01:24:31.475
It's Dr. Gwinett.

01:24:32.575 --> 01:24:34.341
Where is she?

01:24:34.343 --> 01:24:35.980
Um, she's upstairs.

01:24:45.055 --> 01:24:47.354
I've never seen
anything like this before.

01:24:47.356 --> 01:24:49.256
It's like the child
is shrinking.

01:24:49.258 --> 01:24:51.926
What?
What do we do?

01:24:51.928 --> 01:24:53.394
We... We can't
lose another, Doc.

01:24:53.396 --> 01:24:56.430
It'll kill her.
It'll kill us both.

01:24:56.432 --> 01:25:00.202
Wait, are you saying that this
is your child inside her?

01:25:00.204 --> 01:25:01.502
What? Yes!

01:25:01.504 --> 01:25:04.371
Doc, wait, wait.
Where you going?

01:25:04.373 --> 01:25:07.408
I don't work for coloreds, and I definitely
don't work for any mixed marriage.

01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:09.544
No, he's not my husband.
He kidnapped me.

01:25:09.546 --> 01:25:11.947
- Emily, what?
- You need to leave this house now.

01:25:11.949 --> 01:25:13.447
You can't make me
leave my own house.

01:25:13.449 --> 01:25:16.184
Bull! Negroes can't own
homes in this district.

01:25:16.186 --> 01:25:18.987
Now do as I say and get your
black ass out of this house!

01:25:18.989 --> 01:25:20.455
- The only one leaving this house is you.
- No. No.

01:25:20.457 --> 01:25:21.488
- Get out!
- Don't touch him.

01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:22.957
Get out!
Emily, stop!

01:25:22.959 --> 01:25:24.059
No!

01:25:24.061 --> 01:25:26.094
Get...

01:25:26.096 --> 01:25:27.328
Get the hell out!

01:25:28.966 --> 01:25:30.497
You don't put your hands
on a white man like that!

01:25:30.499 --> 01:25:31.867
You bastard!

01:25:31.869 --> 01:25:33.237
Stop!

01:25:38.408 --> 01:25:39.941
Emily, stop!

01:25:39.943 --> 01:25:41.576
I don't know where
you stole that phone,

01:25:41.578 --> 01:25:44.411
but unless it's got an app on it
to turn your black ass invisible,

01:25:44.413 --> 01:25:46.180
you got hell
to pay, boy!

01:25:52.021 --> 01:25:56.090
Henry! It doesn't matter what I say.
You need to talk to him.

01:25:56.092 --> 01:25:58.359
Mama, not now.
I don't know what's goin' on.

01:25:58.361 --> 01:26:01.263
What's goin' on is that
you need to see that boy.

01:26:01.265 --> 01:26:03.434
Otherwise, your child
won't be the only one lost.

01:26:16.212 --> 01:26:19.514
All right,
where's this ghost?

01:26:19.516 --> 01:26:22.017
Stop being disrespectful,
Henry.

01:26:22.019 --> 01:26:25.323
He's right in front of you.
My apologies.

01:26:26.422 --> 01:26:28.255
Okay, this is stupid.

01:26:28.257 --> 01:26:31.492
If you want your wife back, you got
to see what's in front of you.

01:26:31.494 --> 01:26:33.560
Focus.
Open your eyes.

01:26:33.562 --> 01:26:36.600
Respect the sacrifices that's been gifted you.

01:26:42.306 --> 01:26:44.572
- Where'd you come from?
- The past.

01:26:44.574 --> 01:26:46.974
But I've been blessed
with a chance to see the future,

01:26:46.976 --> 01:26:49.079
and, well, it's not
at all what I thought.

01:26:50.113 --> 01:26:51.446
What kinda craziness
is this?

01:26:51.448 --> 01:26:53.480
No craziness, sir.

01:26:53.482 --> 01:26:56.651
Just realizing I went through a lot
of hell for nothing, so it seems.

01:26:56.653 --> 01:26:59.353
What do you mean?
Who the hell are you?

01:26:59.355 --> 01:27:02.092
My family calls me Bobo,
but you might know me by Emmett.

01:27:03.226 --> 01:27:04.662
Emmett Till, sir.

01:27:06.163 --> 01:27:08.063
You're trying to tell me
you're Emmett Till?

01:27:08.065 --> 01:27:10.668
Most people recognize me
more like this.

01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:26.281
Mr. Henry, a lot of folks think that Emmett's
death sparked the Civil Rights Movement.

01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:29.517
- Who the hell are you?
- Respect the sacrifice.

01:27:29.519 --> 01:27:32.319
I'm Carole Denise McNair, sir.

01:27:32.321 --> 01:27:34.458
And these are my friends
from Sunday school.

01:27:39.061 --> 01:27:43.298
Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia
Wesley and Carole Robertson.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:45.700
- You're the four little girls.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:45.702 --> 01:27:49.036
From 16th Street
Baptist Church.

01:27:49.038 --> 01:27:51.505
And Emmett standing up
and dying like he did

01:27:51.507 --> 01:27:54.442
helped us get voting rights.

01:27:54.444 --> 01:27:57.112
Why would you support a party
that wants to take them away?

01:27:57.114 --> 01:27:59.046
If this boy died
for civil rights,

01:27:59.048 --> 01:28:02.216
then he should want me to have the
freedom to do and vote as I please.

01:28:02.218 --> 01:28:05.185
I didn't die so you could have
more freedom to do as you please.

01:28:05.187 --> 01:28:08.255
I died so you could have more
freedom to do what's right.

01:28:08.257 --> 01:28:10.425
Like you had a choice.

01:28:10.427 --> 01:28:12.594
Respect the sacrifices.

01:28:12.596 --> 01:28:14.228
You always have a choice.

01:28:14.230 --> 01:28:16.499
Mine was to live like a coward
or die like a man.

01:28:17.601 --> 01:28:19.300
But maybe it wasn't worth it.

01:28:19.302 --> 01:28:21.469
Maybe none of our deaths
were worth it.

01:28:21.471 --> 01:28:26.107
But that would mean that James, Andrew and
Michael's deaths weren't worth it either.

01:28:26.109 --> 01:28:29.079
Chaney, Goodman, Schwerner.

01:28:30.747 --> 01:28:31.749
Or even Mr. Evers.

01:28:38.087 --> 01:28:39.589
And I'm pretty sure
you know who that is.

01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:41.592
Dr. King.

01:28:46.163 --> 01:28:47.732
Don't forget her.

01:28:51.234 --> 01:28:54.268
- Who is that?
- My mother.

01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:57.772
Her sacrifice was letting
the world see my body,

01:28:57.774 --> 01:29:01.376
knowing this horrible image would
haunt her for the rest of her life.

01:29:01.378 --> 01:29:03.644
A lot of folks
took a lot of pain

01:29:03.646 --> 01:29:07.247
for you to be so cavalier
about your freedom, Mr. Bradley.

01:29:07.249 --> 01:29:10.518
Respect the sacrifices
gifted you.

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:13.520
Respect the sacrifices
gifted you.

01:29:13.522 --> 01:29:16.424
Respect the sacrifices
gifted you.

01:29:16.426 --> 01:29:19.426
Respect the sacrifices
gifted you.

01:29:19.428 --> 01:29:22.563
- Respect the sacrifices given you.
- No.

01:29:22.565 --> 01:29:24.165
Respect the sacrifices
given you.

01:29:24.167 --> 01:29:25.433
- No, no, no!
- Respect...-

01:29:25.435 --> 01:29:27.202
Stop!

01:29:27.204 --> 01:29:29.403
Well, it seems
I have a second chance.

01:29:29.405 --> 01:29:31.605
And this time, I think I'm gonna
choose a bit differently.

01:29:31.607 --> 01:29:33.241
Emmett, you can't.

01:29:33.243 --> 01:29:36.478
Actually, he can.
But you can't let him.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:40.348
If Emmett doesn't die,
history changes.

01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:42.517
Perhaps
none of them die.

01:29:42.519 --> 01:29:48.122
Perhaps, the only thing that dies is a
chance at the civil rights you enjoy.

01:29:48.124 --> 01:29:51.492
No, this is crazy.
No way this can be happening.

01:29:51.494 --> 01:29:53.894
It is happening, Henry, and you
need to stop it before it...

01:30:02.739 --> 01:30:04.238
Go!

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.307
There he is! That's the
nigger that raped me.

01:30:06.309 --> 01:30:08.242
What?

01:30:08.244 --> 01:30:10.577
- Come here, boy.
- Emily, I'm your husband!

01:30:10.579 --> 01:30:13.447
You're just makin' it worse,
disrespectin' that white woman.

01:30:13.449 --> 01:30:15.316
Hold on a minute. He didn't rape her.
That's his wife!

01:30:15.318 --> 01:30:16.787
Hush up, you nigger bitch!

01:30:17.686 --> 01:30:18.819
Yeah, stay down.

01:30:18.821 --> 01:30:20.220
You motherfucker!
I'll kill you!

01:30:20.222 --> 01:30:21.622
Get...

01:30:24.828 --> 01:30:26.493
Watch it, now.

01:30:26.495 --> 01:30:28.462
- Get him outta here!
- Let me go!

01:30:28.464 --> 01:30:30.497
Let me go!
Let me go!

01:30:30.499 --> 01:30:31.698
Get him!

01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:33.568
- Wait! Get him!
- Hey!

01:30:33.570 --> 01:30:37.308
Can't you do something?

01:30:42.745 --> 01:30:44.812
What would you like us to do,
Mr. Bradley?

01:30:44.814 --> 01:30:46.848
Go back and die to make
your life a little easier?

01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:49.453
It's not for me. It's for
my child, for my wife.

01:30:51.954 --> 01:30:55.622
That's not her. She's not racist.
She loves me.

01:30:55.624 --> 01:30:58.128
She did.
And she can again.

01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:02.496
But you have to join us.
You have to sacrifice.

01:31:02.498 --> 01:31:03.630
What does that mean?

01:31:03.632 --> 01:31:06.201
It means you wouldn't
be here without me.

01:31:06.203 --> 01:31:07.568
Without us.

01:31:07.570 --> 01:31:11.471
And as you can see,
without all the sacrifices,

01:31:11.473 --> 01:31:13.273
everything in
your world changes.

01:31:13.275 --> 01:31:15.475
If what you want
is worth us dying for,

01:31:15.477 --> 01:31:17.248
why isn't it worth
you dying for?

01:31:18.614 --> 01:31:19.482
'Cause you're already dead.

01:31:21.717 --> 01:31:23.617
Don't have to be.

01:31:23.619 --> 01:31:26.754
I can make a different choice,
live a different life.

01:31:26.756 --> 01:31:28.790
Maybe we all live
different lives.

01:31:28.792 --> 01:31:33.497
Maybe I'll go to school, maybe I become
a councilman, and I can avoid this.

01:31:34.698 --> 01:31:36.831
But if you want me
to take that whooping,

01:31:36.833 --> 01:31:39.000
if you want us
to sacrifice our lives

01:31:39.002 --> 01:31:41.402
to make the lives of your
loved ones a little better,

01:31:41.404 --> 01:31:43.240
you need to change, sir.

01:31:45.976 --> 01:31:49.743
Okay. I won't vote to close the
polls, and I'll leave the party.

01:31:49.745 --> 01:31:50.881
That's no longer an option.

01:31:52.716 --> 01:31:54.385
You've got to go
the extra mile.

01:31:55.851 --> 01:31:57.687
Will you sacrifice with me?

01:32:04.327 --> 01:32:05.660
I, uh...

01:32:05.662 --> 01:32:07.397
Well, that seems
to answer it.

01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:09.732
Looks like this is good-bye.

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:12.500
No, wait.

01:32:12.502 --> 01:32:14.301
- Let's go!
- No, wait. Wait, wait!

01:32:14.303 --> 01:32:15.870
Please! Please!
I need more time.

01:32:15.872 --> 01:32:18.038
Just, I-I j...
I just need more time! Please!

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.410
Wait!
Get off me!

01:32:23.812 --> 01:32:25.979
- No, wait! I need more time...
- Take this black bitch too!

01:32:25.981 --> 01:32:28.750
Please! Let me go!
Let me...

01:32:28.752 --> 01:32:31.518
If you left any seed in me, you could
be damn well sure I'm gonna kill it.

01:32:36.359 --> 01:32:39.693
Okay, I will. I will! I will!

01:32:39.695 --> 01:32:41.429
- I will!
- Get him!

01:32:41.431 --> 01:32:43.934
Son of a bitch!
Get him!

01:32:46.802 --> 01:32:49.469
I'll do it.
I'll take your sacrifice.

01:32:49.471 --> 01:32:51.805
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:32:51.807 --> 01:32:52.842
I'm a man.

01:32:56.879 --> 01:32:58.348
Boy, he said "Are you sure?"

01:33:01.484 --> 01:33:03.885
I'm a man.

01:33:03.887 --> 01:33:07.258
And I intend to live like one until
the last breath God gives me.

01:33:16.565 --> 01:33:18.501
Then take
what you asked for.

01:34:55.998 --> 01:34:58.198
Oh, my God!
What happened?

01:36:27.824 --> 01:36:29.460
I'm proud of you, son.

01:37:03.159 --> 01:37:05.225
Can't say that was
your best story, Simms.

01:37:05.227 --> 01:37:08.763
Can't say that I liked
that one much at all.

01:37:08.765 --> 01:37:09.863
We should get moving,
Mr. Beach.

01:37:09.865 --> 01:37:12.265
The event
is ready to start.

01:37:12.267 --> 01:37:13.837
Grant, is the Robo-Patriot
prepped?

01:37:15.204 --> 01:37:17.040
Uh, entirely, sir.

01:37:19.309 --> 01:37:21.041
Here we go.

01:37:21.043 --> 01:37:25.845
When these
media assholes see this,

01:37:25.847 --> 01:37:29.116
it's just gonna
be like holy shit.

01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:34.921
- Yeah! The shit!
- Yeah.

01:37:34.923 --> 01:37:37.591
The doo-doo!
The poopity pop!

01:37:39.095 --> 01:37:40.126
Are you okay, Simms?

01:37:40.128 --> 01:37:42.729
Apologies.

01:37:42.731 --> 01:37:47.201
I mean, it's just that... Do you mind
if I watch the press conference?

01:37:47.203 --> 01:37:49.937
I mean...

01:37:49.939 --> 01:37:51.975
I would love
to see the shit!

01:37:53.876 --> 01:37:56.176
I think it's gonna
be quite amazing!

01:38:03.052 --> 01:38:05.889
Ooh, hoo hoo!

01:38:07.289 --> 01:38:09.091
- Oh!
- No harm, I suppose.

01:38:09.993 --> 01:38:12.026
Let's go.

01:38:12.028 --> 01:38:18.366
So, to further explain, let me bring up
the leader in corrective technology,

01:38:18.368 --> 01:38:20.037
Dumass Beach.

01:38:25.908 --> 01:38:28.975
Thank you, Kelly.
I'm gonna get right to it.

01:38:28.977 --> 01:38:32.846
Here at Beach Industries, we want
to do what's right for America.

01:38:32.848 --> 01:38:36.817
Now, that means safer
streets, cities and states.

01:38:36.819 --> 01:38:40.187
Beach Industries wants
to help create a country

01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:46.126
where foreign scum, terrorists,
rapists, and criminals of all kinds

01:38:46.128 --> 01:38:49.697
cannot only be quickly
and easily identified,

01:38:49.699 --> 01:38:51.666
but justly convicted,

01:38:51.668 --> 01:38:55.702
and punished in a way that saves
billions of tax dollars,

01:38:55.704 --> 01:38:59.005
that until now
have been wasted on funding

01:38:59.007 --> 01:39:02.678
a legal system that
is woefully ineffective.

01:39:09.718 --> 01:39:11.053
Thank you, Grant.

01:39:12.954 --> 01:39:18.325
So today, I present to you
the future of American security,

01:39:18.327 --> 01:39:20.361
the Robo-Patriot.

01:39:36.846 --> 01:39:40.480
This machine not only has the
ability to, within seconds,

01:39:40.482 --> 01:39:46.953
scan NSA, FBI, CIA, local
police, and social media files

01:39:46.955 --> 01:39:51.459
to quickly identify those who have
already committed criminal acts,

01:39:51.461 --> 01:39:55.462
but uses new technology
created by my company

01:39:55.464 --> 01:40:01.768
to predict a person's criminal
or anti-American threat level

01:40:01.770 --> 01:40:05.406
by reading brain waves,
heat patterns and DNA,

01:40:05.408 --> 01:40:11.211
which it captures, using molecules found
in a person's breath as they exhale.

01:40:11.213 --> 01:40:14.014
Well, this gives a whole new
meaning to the term, "bad breath."

01:40:15.051 --> 01:40:16.817
Uh, Mr. Beach, are you saying

01:40:16.819 --> 01:40:18.986
this thing can
predict criminal behavior?

01:40:18.988 --> 01:40:20.286
More than that.

01:40:20.288 --> 01:40:23.456
I'm saying it knows
100 percent

01:40:23.458 --> 01:40:26.527
if someone will or will not
commit a future crime

01:40:26.529 --> 01:40:30.898
that could harm any number
of lawful American citizens.

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:35.301
This is an intelligent machine
that can police our streets

01:40:35.303 --> 01:40:41.207
as well as serve as judge, jury,
and if need be, executioner.

01:40:45.882 --> 01:40:48.916
I know.
It sounds amazing, right?

01:40:48.918 --> 01:40:51.452
So, we prepared
a little demonstration.

01:40:51.454 --> 01:40:55.389
We have placed among you men and
women who have criminal histories.

01:40:55.391 --> 01:40:58.858
Let's see if the Robo-Patriot
can find them.

01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:01.161
Is this thing
gonna kill someone?

01:41:01.163 --> 01:41:07.367
The Robo-Patriot will do whatever is necessary
to protect America and its true citizens.

01:41:07.369 --> 01:41:09.905
So unless you have plans on,
uh, harming America...

01:41:11.039 --> 01:41:12.572
Anyone?

01:41:12.574 --> 01:41:14.575
You should all be fine.

01:41:21.551 --> 01:41:25.051
<i>Robo-Patriot is activated and looking
for threats against America.</i>

01:41:31.427 --> 01:41:34.929
<i>Robo-Patriot identifies
criminals at threat level two.</i>

01:41:34.931 --> 01:41:37.134
Threat level two is simply
small-time burglars.

01:41:40.468 --> 01:41:41.602
Whoa.

01:41:41.604 --> 01:41:43.269
Turn yourselves in

01:41:43.271 --> 01:41:45.939
to avoid further legal actions
to protect America.

01:41:45.941 --> 01:41:49.042
There we go.
There we go!

01:41:49.044 --> 01:41:50.243
How about that,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:41:51.547 --> 01:41:54.948
American technology at work.

01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:56.086
Built in America.

01:41:58.119 --> 01:42:01.589
<i>Robo-Patriot identifies
illegals without papers.</i>

01:42:01.591 --> 01:42:06.059
<i>Please turn yourselves in, or I will
do what it takes to protect America.</i>

01:42:06.061 --> 01:42:08.495
Ah, it's a beautiful thing.

01:42:08.497 --> 01:42:10.563
How about
that, ladies and gentlemen.

01:42:12.133 --> 01:42:16.138
Here to protect your families,
your American families.

01:42:17.906 --> 01:42:19.473
How do we know
these aren't plants?

01:42:19.475 --> 01:42:22.876
Well, as you know, I run the toughest prison...

01:42:22.878 --> 01:42:26.145
- What?
- Like a person, it can learn from secondhand experience.

01:42:26.147 --> 01:42:28.948
Stories, fables, tales.

01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:33.055
Those young guys? Hormones.
Boys will be boys.

01:42:36.092 --> 01:42:41.461
Your kind are
particularly accomplished liars.

01:42:41.463 --> 01:42:47.067
Your brothers and sisters make up
an enormous part of my profits.

01:42:47.069 --> 01:42:52.505
As well as serve
as judge, jury, executioner.

01:42:52.507 --> 01:42:54.610
Judge, jury, executioner.

01:42:57.113 --> 01:43:02.349
<i>Robo-Patriot identifies one immediate clear
and present threat to American civilization.</i>

01:43:02.351 --> 01:43:04.117
Oh!

01:43:04.119 --> 01:43:08.923
Uh-oh! Perhaps he thinks the fake media...
is a real threat.

01:43:10.626 --> 01:43:12.192
All right.

01:43:15.631 --> 01:43:19.366
<i>Robo-Patriot
recognizes Dumb Ass Bitch.</i>

01:43:24.507 --> 01:43:27.573
That's, uh, Dumass Beach.

01:43:27.575 --> 01:43:33.212
Um, it, uh, polices much better
than it speaks. Trust me.

01:43:33.214 --> 01:43:37.486
<i>As a lethal threat that must be immediately
neutralized to secure American safety.</i>

01:43:39.355 --> 01:43:44.524
<i>Neutralizing the threat
in five, four, three, two...</i>

01:43:44.526 --> 01:43:45.658
- What the hell's...
- <i>...one.</i>

01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:48.461
No!

01:43:48.463 --> 01:43:50.464
Goddamn thing!
What the hell is...

01:43:50.466 --> 01:43:52.599
No! No, stop!

01:43:54.035 --> 01:43:55.301
Somebody's gonna
lose their job...

01:43:55.303 --> 01:43:58.104
<i>Robo-Patriot recognizes
worthless accomplices</i>

01:43:58.106 --> 01:44:00.073
<i>aiding and abetting
Dumb Ass Bitch.</i>

01:44:00.075 --> 01:44:01.377
No! No!

01:44:06.614 --> 01:44:07.516
I never liked him!

01:44:09.985 --> 01:44:11.452
Help!

01:44:11.454 --> 01:44:13.290
This robot has
lost its damn mind!

01:44:19.427 --> 01:44:21.060
Shit! Shit!

01:44:21.062 --> 01:44:22.595
- <i>Robo-Patriot will protect America.</i>
- Fuck!

01:44:22.597 --> 01:44:24.398
No, no, no, no!

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:26.136
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:44:34.209 --> 01:44:35.776
Metal motherfucker!

01:44:35.778 --> 01:44:37.643
No! No, no!

01:44:37.645 --> 01:44:39.048
Help!

01:44:39.781 --> 01:44:42.081
Help! Help! No!

01:44:43.552 --> 01:44:47.020
Wait. No, no. Please.

01:44:47.022 --> 01:44:49.055
- Oh!
- Beach!

01:44:49.057 --> 01:44:50.426
Going my way?

01:44:52.727 --> 01:44:54.694
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Drive!

01:44:56.632 --> 01:44:58.668
I think it got me.

01:44:59.568 --> 01:45:02.435
Christ!

01:45:02.437 --> 01:45:05.139
I'm afraid Christ can no longer
be of service, Mr. Beach.

01:45:05.141 --> 01:45:08.242
Oh, skip the religious
lecture and drive, Simms!

01:45:08.244 --> 01:45:12.246
Holy shit!

01:45:12.248 --> 01:45:13.714
Ah, yes.

01:45:13.716 --> 01:45:17.151
The shit!

01:45:17.153 --> 01:45:19.085
What the hell is your
black ass laughing about?

01:45:19.087 --> 01:45:20.653
You think this is
some kind of joke?

01:45:20.655 --> 01:45:24.224
You drive this car
to a goddamn hospital

01:45:24.226 --> 01:45:28.194
before I bleed out and die,
you crazy nigger!

01:45:28.196 --> 01:45:30.296
This ain't no joke!

01:45:30.298 --> 01:45:32.299
This ain't no car.

01:45:32.301 --> 01:45:34.468
I ain't no nigger!

01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:38.538
And your worthless soul
is no longer alive!

01:45:47.115 --> 01:45:51.220
Where am I?
Where am I?

01:45:53.489 --> 01:45:59.559
Mr. Dumass Beach, welcome
to hell, motherfucker!

01:46:09.171 --> 01:46:10.837
No! No! No!

01:46:55.450 --> 01:46:58.919
Welcome to hell, motherfucker!

01:48:27.476 --> 01:48:28.709
Ha!

01:50:06.975 --> 01:50:10.012
Now that... was some shit.
