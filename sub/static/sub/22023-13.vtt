"Barbarian's Gate 3"
is being released today,

00:09.287 --> 00:11.251
so I need everybody on their A-game,

00:11.253 --> 00:13.887
as this store is going to be
packed with video game nerds.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.656
And we don't want to risk a trampling.

00:15.658 --> 00:17.841
Well, we're never going
to totally prevent tramplings.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.994
Oh, no, obviously we're never
going to have zero tramplings,

00:20.996 --> 00:23.464
but we can have fewer tramplings.

00:23.466 --> 00:25.321
Um, can I set one of
the video games aside

00:25.322 --> 00:26.392
before we sell out?

00:26.393 --> 00:29.770
Amy, employees can't reserve
merchandise, you know this.

00:29.772 --> 00:32.506
- You're into video games?
- After a long day of work,

00:32.508 --> 00:34.508
It's nice to have a glass
of wine and reach into

00:34.510 --> 00:36.477
a stable boy's chest and pull
out his still-beating heart.

00:36.479 --> 00:37.432
- [laughs]
- Feed the birds.

00:37.433 --> 00:38.779
I just don't get how

00:38.781 --> 00:41.615
murdering people is considered fun.

00:41.991 --> 00:43.917
I mean, what happened
to all those innocent games?

00:43.919 --> 00:47.287
You know, like "Frogger,"
and "Qbert," and "Donkey Kong."

00:47.289 --> 00:49.823
Innocent? "Qbert" is about
a big-nosed, creepily little

00:49.825 --> 00:52.226
freak that commits suicide
when things get hard.

00:52.228 --> 00:54.561
"Frogger" is basically a frog Holocaust.

00:54.563 --> 00:58.307
I remember a glitch in
the original "Donkey Kong"

00:58.307 --> 01:00.938
where it looks like the ape has a penis.

01:00.939 --> 01:04.498
Sometimes when I'm playing "The
Sims," I give myself a family.

01:07.376 --> 01:08.475

01:13.710 --> 01:18.469
[indistinct chatter]

01:19.619 --> 01:21.382
The nerd smell is overwhelming.

01:21.383 --> 01:22.876
It's like a potent blend of

01:22.877 --> 01:24.704
BO, pizza rolls, and misogyny.

01:25.063 --> 01:28.465
Hey, Dina, so I know that
employees aren't supposed

01:28.466 --> 01:30.595
to set aside merch,
but I was just wondering

01:30.596 --> 01:32.657
if maybe you'd want to make an exception

01:32.658 --> 01:33.879
for your best friend?

01:33.880 --> 01:35.613
My old best friend
is currently in prison

01:35.614 --> 01:37.019
for cheating on her taxes.

01:37.020 --> 01:39.428
Ask her if I'm willing
to "make an exception."

01:39.654 --> 01:40.920
[sniffs]

01:40.922 --> 01:43.250
Ugh, hair gel and urine.

01:44.377 --> 01:45.905
I can't, I can't.

01:46.796 --> 01:50.097
Oh, come on, three of them?
That's not fair.

01:50.099 --> 01:52.099
They're going to sell out
before my shift is over.

01:52.101 --> 01:53.917
Why don't you just
sneak one out of the cage

01:53.919 --> 01:55.869
- and put it aside for later?
- No, it's fine.

01:55.871 --> 01:57.905
I guess I'll just wait
until we get another restock.

01:57.907 --> 01:59.707
Oh, but you shouldn't have to.

01:59.709 --> 02:02.229
- You des...
- Don't say "you deserve this."

02:02.878 --> 02:04.862
- I wasn't going to say that.
- What were you going to say?

02:04.864 --> 02:07.096
[stammering] You... deserve this.

02:08.074 --> 02:09.550
Okay, you're right, I do deserve this.

02:09.551 --> 02:11.485
I deserve to disembowel warlocks.

02:11.487 --> 02:12.920
Yes, you... do.

02:12.922 --> 02:14.738
- Then let's do this.
- Let's do this.

02:15.773 --> 02:17.291
[sniffs] Oh, yep, urine.

02:18.842 --> 02:20.686
Thank you so much for coming by.

02:21.991 --> 02:23.364
Hey, how you doing, Mr. Evans?

02:23.366 --> 02:24.832
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

02:24.834 --> 02:27.301
I'm a huge fan of your voiceover work.

02:27.303 --> 02:30.217
In fact, my text alert
is you from "Alpha Strike"

02:30.218 --> 02:32.406
saying "Decapitation bonus!"

02:32.915 --> 02:35.142
[deep voice] Decapitation bonus!

02:35.969 --> 02:37.812
[laughing] That is awesome!

02:38.390 --> 02:40.154
- Thanks.
- Yeah, cool, well, hey.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.434
That's all I wanted to say.

02:41.435 --> 02:42.989
You know, I just think you're great,

02:42.989 --> 02:45.119
and you know, you mean the world to me.

02:45.221 --> 02:46.920
- Okay.
- That's...

02:46.922 --> 02:48.576
that sounded weird.

02:48.577 --> 02:50.577
I mean, not the world,
but a lot, you know?

02:50.579 --> 02:52.527
You, you mean a lot to me.

02:54.691 --> 02:57.017
Oh, my mouth, my mouth is so dry.

02:57.019 --> 02:59.081
[laughs]

02:59.785 --> 03:02.689
Yeah, yeah, I can taste it.

03:02.690 --> 03:07.909
If we could just, like, move,
and make a line to the side.

03:08.632 --> 03:10.778
And then people could pass on this side.

03:11.130 --> 03:14.715
And if we then...
if we could all go this way.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.669
Sandra, we need this area clear.

03:16.670 --> 03:18.427
- This is a fire hazard.
- I know.

03:18.428 --> 03:20.926
I told them and they told me
that my butt's a fire hazard.

03:20.927 --> 03:22.228
I'm trying to think of a comeback.

03:22.229 --> 03:26.621
Okay, guys, I really need you
to make a line that way.

03:27.433 --> 03:28.201
Okay?

03:29.336 --> 03:32.616
Attention, all soft boys.
Get off your butts,

03:32.617 --> 03:34.709
and move to the side, now!

03:35.126 --> 03:37.226
The first person to step out of line

03:37.228 --> 03:39.745
is going to get my foot in their throat.

03:40.881 --> 03:42.773
Use... less.

03:43.234 --> 03:44.128
Useless.

03:46.499 --> 03:49.915
[groans] Come on.

03:52.235 --> 03:53.904
You try. Your arms are longer.

03:54.123 --> 03:54.993
Me? Yeah, but you know,

03:55.010 --> 03:57.063
I think my bicep
might be a little big for...

03:57.135 --> 03:58.864
Oh, hey. Slipped right in there.

03:58.866 --> 04:00.833
Mmm, not long enough.

04:00.835 --> 04:02.007
[groans]

04:03.454 --> 04:09.038
Well, I guess I'll just stick to
"Barbarian's Gate 2," like a commoner.

04:09.039 --> 04:10.370
Wait, what's that back there?

04:10.370 --> 04:14.041
- Is that a door?
- Um, maybe.

04:14.041 --> 04:15.869
It kind of just looks like a closet.

04:16.401 --> 04:19.029
Or it's another way into the cage.

04:19.031 --> 04:21.171
- Like an access tunnel.
- You know,

04:21.624 --> 04:24.350
Glenn does still have the plans
from the renovation.

04:24.709 --> 04:28.111
We could break into his
office, steal the blueprints,

04:28.113 --> 04:29.562
and navigate our way around the...

04:29.564 --> 04:31.397
Okay, you don't have to mock me.

04:31.399 --> 04:33.208
We crawl through the tunnel
and then we jimmy the door...

04:33.209 --> 04:36.179
- I was only trying to help...
- I'm agreeing with you!

04:36.180 --> 04:38.590
Oh. Cool, all right.

04:38.591 --> 04:40.599
Well, uh, let's do this, then.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.008
It'll be like a little adventure.

04:42.010 --> 04:43.960
Yeah, it's going to be
the adventure of a lifetime.

04:44.528 --> 04:45.755
- Was that...
- Sarcasm.

04:45.765 --> 04:46.701
Definitely.

04:47.210 --> 04:50.160
Okay, so it seems like
there's another access point

04:50.191 --> 04:52.478
on this floor right around...

04:52.719 --> 04:55.575
- uh, this office.
- Really, where?

04:56.240 --> 04:58.655
According to this, it's right there.

04:58.755 --> 05:01.066
Well, there's clearly nothing there.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.328
To the naked eye.

05:02.329 --> 05:04.417
There might be a false wall, you know?

05:04.419 --> 05:06.386
The thing about drywall is,
you have to listen to it.

05:06.388 --> 05:08.121
- Because it sings a song.
- Oh.

05:08.123 --> 05:10.537
It lets you know where you need to go.

05:10.537 --> 05:11.475
- [knocking on wall]
- Uh-huh.

05:11.476 --> 05:14.815
What I'm trying to do right now
is find a hollow spot, okay?

05:16.589 --> 05:18.626
They're pretty much all hollow spots.

05:19.010 --> 05:20.567
Maybe this is it?

05:22.082 --> 05:22.826
Oh.

05:23.517 --> 05:24.666
I'm just guessing.

05:24.814 --> 05:27.607
I see what I did there.

05:27.608 --> 05:30.972
I confused the title block
and the revision block.

05:30.973 --> 05:33.391
Totally, yeah,
that happens all the time.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.995
Do you know why
we're always the victims?

05:36.997 --> 05:37.917
Because...

05:39.569 --> 05:40.999
I'm sorry, Glenn, I don't know.

05:41.001 --> 05:43.802
It's because we make
ourselves the victim.

05:43.804 --> 05:45.904
But I am done being a doormat.

05:45.906 --> 05:47.365
It would be nice
not to get pushed around.

05:47.366 --> 05:49.415
- Yeah.
- My mailman uses the bathroom

05:49.416 --> 05:51.069
in my apartment every day.

05:51.378 --> 05:54.289
He used to knock, but then
he made me make him a key.

05:54.631 --> 05:55.647
So...

05:55.649 --> 05:57.410
Well, no more.

05:58.361 --> 06:00.552
Yeah, from now on,

06:00.554 --> 06:02.671
we are going to stand up for ourselves.

06:02.673 --> 06:03.905
Okay, I guess.

06:03.907 --> 06:05.724
Come on, say it like you mean it.

06:05.726 --> 06:06.858
Okay, I guess!

06:06.860 --> 06:08.235
That's the spirit!

06:08.929 --> 06:10.377
Ah, got to get back to work.

06:10.377 --> 06:11.429
- Right.
- Good talking with you.

06:11.430 --> 06:12.226
No problem.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.886
Do you have any idea
who you were just talking to?

06:15.888 --> 06:17.502
- Who, that guy?
- Yeah, that's Erick Evans.

06:17.504 --> 06:19.804
He's been nominated for like,
five DICE awards.

06:20.342 --> 06:21.973
- Okay.
- He's a legend.

06:22.414 --> 06:24.064
That's like if you met J. Lo.

06:24.065 --> 06:26.560
Oh, what, just because
I'm gay, I like J. Lo?

06:27.217 --> 06:29.704
I mean, I do, she's flawless.
But expand your mind.

06:29.704 --> 06:30.887
What did you guys talk about?

06:30.889 --> 06:32.416
I don't know, just small talk.

06:32.991 --> 06:35.825
Tell me everything he said.

06:35.827 --> 06:37.577
Fine, ugh.

06:38.174 --> 06:38.928
He was like,

06:38.930 --> 06:40.864
"There's so much traffic
on Delmar this morning."

06:40.866 --> 06:43.433
And I was like, "You're right,
Delmar was bumper to bumper."

06:43.435 --> 06:44.734
- Forget it.
- No, no, wait.

06:44.736 --> 06:45.869
I haven't gotten to the juicy part yet.

06:45.871 --> 06:47.470
So, apparently,

06:47.472 --> 06:49.472
he doesn't think his Taurus
has enough power.

06:49.474 --> 06:50.623
Yeah, whatever, dude.

[clears throat] Hi, ma'am.

06:52.744 --> 06:56.362
Once again, mouth breathers,
this is not personal.

06:56.846 --> 06:58.381
It's not about who you are.

06:58.383 --> 07:00.350
It's about how you smell.

07:00.746 --> 07:02.869
And your stench is overwhelming.

07:03.587 --> 07:06.184
This is not attacking
any one individual.

07:06.418 --> 07:08.769
Although if I had to
single out the stink king,

07:08.770 --> 07:11.308
it would for sure be
fatty in the purple hoodie.

your illustrious Cloud 9 tenure

07:21.403 --> 07:22.612
you would have ventured back here.

07:22.628 --> 07:24.138
No, I think they give you access

07:24.139 --> 07:27.572
to the bowels of the store at
15 years, so I'm almost there.

07:27.652 --> 07:30.057
Well, this is weird.
According to the blueprints,

07:30.058 --> 07:33.575
there should be a ladder,
like, right here.

07:37.361 --> 07:39.916

I see what happened.
Texted the wrong Glen.

18:25.735 --> 18:29.311
"Sorry, pregnant with Glenn with two Ns.

18:29.737 --> 18:30.653
LOL."

18:31.586 --> 18:32.586
My mechanic.

18:32.587 --> 18:35.859
My assistant manager and I,
we're going to have a baby.

18:35.860 --> 18:36.495
Oh, boy.

18:36.981 --> 18:39.816
Oh, God, I can't wait to tell my wife.

18:40.807 --> 18:42.853
- What is happening here?
- I don't know.

18:42.854 --> 18:44.926
I'm going to be a daddy.

18:46.122 --> 18:48.151
Who's pathetic now?

18:49.259 --> 18:52.293
[all muttering]

18:53.296 --> 18:54.177
I was, um...

18:55.715 --> 18:57.182
No, no, never mind.

18:57.267 --> 18:59.313
[both laugh nervously]

19:00.368 --> 19:04.954
Um, set them up and knock them down?

19:05.518 --> 19:07.388
[exhales] Soap.

19:09.779 --> 19:10.714
Soap.

19:13.316 --> 19:15.800
So, this is... this is cool.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.707
I'm so glad we're doing this.

19:19.175 --> 19:21.403
Yeah, it's... it's very cool.

19:21.543 --> 19:23.126
[chuckles]

19:23.743 --> 19:25.006
No, it's not cool.

19:25.613 --> 19:27.175
Normally I'm the cool guy.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.482
They call me the Samuel L.
Jackson of this store.

19:29.483 --> 19:31.121
- Who calls you the...
- But for some reason,

19:31.122 --> 19:32.794
around you, and I don't know what it is,

19:32.795 --> 19:34.397
because you're just some guy
who stands in a booth

19:34.398 --> 19:35.883
and does a bunch of silly voices,

19:35.885 --> 19:37.554
so I don't know why
you think you're so great.

19:37.562 --> 19:39.125
I don't... I don't... I never said that.

19:39.126 --> 19:41.886
You know, I met Scott Bakula
at an Outback Steakhouse,

19:41.887 --> 19:45.125
and it was smooth sailing.
And that guy, he quantum leapt.

19:45.126 --> 19:48.319
Or leaped, or whatever it was.
I don't care, because I'm cool.

19:48.849 --> 19:50.294
You're not better than me!

19:51.133 --> 19:53.883
So enjoy losing another
DICE award to Troy Baker.

19:54.045 --> 19:54.668
Jerk.

19:55.408 --> 19:56.965
Taurus-driving loser.

19:59.931 --> 20:00.903
[clears throat]

20:01.901 --> 20:04.902
I mean, the sad thing is,
he is the cool one.

20:05.032 --> 20:05.394
So...

20:06.218 --> 20:08.401
- [sighs]
- Oh, no.

20:08.867 --> 20:11.117
- It's over, huh?
- Yeah.

20:11.305 --> 20:13.531
It's fine, I made too
big a deal out of it.

20:13.532 --> 20:16.306
Oh, okay, then I guess
you won't want this.

20:16.322 --> 20:19.192
- What? How?
- I bribed some kid

20:19.193 --> 20:20.892
with a couple of cans
of that malt drink.

20:20.893 --> 20:23.132
He was a bigger kid, so I think
his heart can handle it.

20:23.133 --> 20:25.448
Jonah, thank you!

20:25.449 --> 20:27.899
Oh, my God, I can't wait
to decapitate somebody.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.774
Yeah, well, I am happy to help.

20:29.866 --> 20:30.985
Do you want to see how it's done?

20:30.986 --> 20:32.443
I could put it in the demo,

20:32.529 --> 20:33.611
and I could show you really quick.

20:33.697 --> 20:35.593
- It's so much fun.
- Oh, uh...

20:35.594 --> 20:39.087
I kind of promised Kelly
that I would meet her tonight.

20:39.088 --> 20:40.223
I so would, though.

20:40.224 --> 20:42.141
- Oh, my God, of course.
- Yeah, no.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.070
But tomorrow.

20:43.545 --> 20:44.481
- Yes.
- Let's do this.

20:44.482 --> 20:47.570
Let's do it tomorrow. Play the game.

20:47.787 --> 20:49.848
- Okay.
- Okay, have a good night.

20:50.052 --> 20:52.400
- You too, enjoy that.
- I will, thank you.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.385
- [chuckles]
- Thank you.

20:56.251 --> 20:56.896
Ugh.

20:57.794 --> 20:59.256
I can still smell them.

20:59.489 --> 21:01.348
It's like Cool Ranch and scrotum.

21:02.225 --> 21:04.566
Hey, Rodriguez,
pay attention, I'm talking.

21:05.215 --> 21:08.031
What, have you got a crush
on Jonah or something?

21:09.016 --> 21:10.816
[exhales]

21:11.401 --> 21:13.317
Yeah, I think I do.

21:14.838 --> 21:15.741
[retching]

21:16.585 --> 21:18.573
It's the smell. It's not this.
