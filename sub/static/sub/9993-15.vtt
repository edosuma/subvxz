00:01.283 --> 00:02.266
Breakfirst's ready !

00:03.796 --> 00:05.768
Everybody ! Lunch !

00:07.006 --> 00:09.013
Lunch! lunch ! lunch, lunch, luuuunnch !!!

00:11.389 --> 00:13.558
Hi, someone please tell me
what's happening up there ?

00:14.356 --> 00:17.636
It's impossible to fire with all that ... 
lumber out there in the middle of the yard.

00:17.953 --> 00:21.699
You know, it's, it's a skateboard ramp
or it's going to be whenever he finishes it.

00:22.458 --> 00:23.471
When he finishes it...

00:28.701 --> 00:30.089
Well, what do you want to know ?

00:30.239 --> 00:32.360
Look, it's simple, you're living 
in a house with five other people.

00:32.711 --> 00:34.199
The backyard is everybody's backyard

00:34.882 --> 00:37.701
so you can't let your project sitting 
out there in the middle of the yard.

00:37.990 --> 00:40.504
- I don't understand why it's so a bid deal,
-You have to put it away.

00:40.603 --> 00:43.279
I mean if it's in your way, 
you can moove it, I won't get mad.

00:43.301 --> 00:44.616
Brian, you're missing the point.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.184
I don't want to put your things away.

00:46.475 --> 00:48.599
No one else in this family
wants to put your things away.

00:49.385 --> 00:50.346
You're 15.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.432
I shouldn't have to explain
common courtesy to you.

00:53.755 --> 00:56.394
No, no, not salad. Anything but salad.

00:56.737 --> 00:58.511
I don't want to hear anything about salad.

01:01.095 --> 01:01.966
Brian?

01:03.047 --> 01:03.898
Are you okay?

01:04.114 --> 01:04.789
Yeah.

01:05.867 --> 01:06.942
Here, drink that.

01:07.145 --> 01:07.682
No.

01:09.086 --> 01:10.185
You all right?

01:11.037 --> 01:11.610
No.

01:12.528 --> 01:13.282
Joe.

01:16.883 --> 01:18.177
Try and spit it out.

01:18.913 --> 01:19.962
Cough it up.

01:23.383 --> 01:24.338
Come on, now.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:33.158 --> 01:34.250
You okay?

01:36.716 --> 01:38.011
No. Yeah.

01:40.652 --> 01:41.745
It's nothing.

01:43.925 --> 01:45.023
It's almost spring.

01:47.147 --> 01:49.320
I had a Brian dream.

01:51.381 --> 01:53.246
I guess I was due.

01:57.869 --> 01:59.054
Hey, what are you doing?

02:01.788 --> 02:02.871
Where are you going?

02:03.066 --> 02:04.180
It's not even 6:00 a.m.

02:04.949 --> 02:07.084
I screwed up. We're all out of coffee.

02:08.241 --> 02:10.788
I was at the market,
I had it on my list and everything.

02:11.053 --> 02:12.258
I don't know what happened.

02:12.812 --> 02:13.822
We're all out.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.540
Okay. We're all out.

02:17.090 --> 02:18.278
We'll drink tea.

02:18.691 --> 02:22.045
We'll drink that nasty flavored stuff
that my mother gave us for Christmas.

02:22.562 --> 02:23.768
I'll go get the coffee.

02:24.750 --> 02:25.981
Hey, where you going?

02:26.397 --> 02:27.475
I'm going to get coffee.

02:29.369 --> 02:30.530
What time did you get up, Al?

02:31.300 --> 02:32.461
Hmm, 5:00 a.m.?

02:32.981 --> 02:33.568
4:00?

02:34.539 --> 02:35.152
3:00?

02:36.553 --> 02:37.940
What difference does it make?

02:38.306 --> 02:40.100
A while ago. And I've done nothing

02:40.798 --> 02:42.447
except get myself very upset.

02:42.707 --> 02:45.089
So why don't you cut me a little slack
and just let me get in the car

02:45.692 --> 02:48.144
and maybe cry a little where
no one can see me or hear me

02:48.526 --> 02:50.315
and I will come home with a sack of coffee.

02:50.936 --> 02:52.515
It's been 15 years, Al.

02:53.757 --> 02:56.305
For God's sake, cut yourself
a little bit of slack.

02:56.923 --> 02:57.847
It was nothing.

02:58.456 --> 03:02.658
It was Mother Nature's way of saying she didn't
get things quite right the first time, that's all.

03:02.723 --> 03:05.205
- God, don't give me a biology lesson.
- And to hurry up and to try again,

03:05.319 --> 03:06.413
which we did.

03:06.648 --> 03:07.610
Just let me get the coffee.

03:07.957 --> 03:08.919
And it worked out great.

03:17.621 --> 03:18.801
Are you guys not open yet?

03:19.134 --> 03:20.899
Um, manager hasn't shown up.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.742
She's supposed to be here at 5:30
for the morning rush, but...

03:23.670 --> 03:24.994
I think I have her cell number.

03:25.368 --> 03:26.501
It's almost 6:30.

03:36.408 --> 03:37.411
I hear something.

03:42.592 --> 03:44.187
I wonder why she isn't answering.

03:47.199 --> 03:47.933
Don't hang up.

03:49.148 --> 03:50.200
I think I hear something inside.

03:51.082 --> 03:52.013
I'm getting her voice mail.

03:52.627 --> 03:53.915
Hang up. Call again.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.218
Hang up, call the police.

04:04.992 --> 04:06.149
Watch out, please.

04:08.131 --> 04:09.525
- Help me with this.
- What...

04:09.615 --> 04:10.560
Help me with this.

04:18.663 --> 04:21.095
She must really be jonesing for that latte.

05:33.781 --> 05:34.539
Hello?

05:34.995 --> 05:36.837
Cancel that APB. I'm fine.

05:36.873 --> 05:40.233
I'm at The Coffee Palace and
have been for the last... hour.

05:41.167 --> 05:43.263
Okay. You're okay. Good. I'm glad.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.349
It's  not what you think. I got here,

05:45.408 --> 05:47.834
a woman had been assaulted,
so I called the police,

05:47.892 --> 05:49.227
I'm just waiting to hear.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.535
I'm sorry about before.

05:53.357 --> 05:54.828
Huh? What? There's nothing
to be sorry about.

05:56.171 --> 05:57.761
Um, oh, wait. Scratch that.

05:58.523 --> 05:59.530
You didn't bring home the coffee.

06:00.019 --> 06:01.640
You should be deeply sorry.

06:02.544 --> 06:03.699
Am I taking the girls to school?

06:05.101 --> 06:06.893
Uh, could you?

06:06.906 --> 06:08.202
I don't think I could leave right now.

06:08.928 --> 06:10.013
No, I figured.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.192
Listen, I got to run.

06:13.626 --> 06:14.452
Cool.

06:21.333 --> 06:23.147
They tell me you're the one
who found the body.

06:23.336 --> 06:24.352
Anything you want to tell me?

06:24.499 --> 06:26.245
I was just coming to buy some coffee, but

06:26.656 --> 06:30.129
it's almost 7:30 in the morning,
we got the District Attorney,

06:30.222 --> 06:31.619
someone from the mayor's office.

06:31.698 --> 06:32.891
Is there anything I should know?

06:33.273 --> 06:35.368
No. Me? I'm just showing the flag.

06:35.721 --> 06:37.798
There's been a string of robberies
in the neighborhood

06:38.152 --> 06:40.273
and the local store owners are
up in arms, as you can imagine.

06:41.337 --> 06:42.102
Her?

06:50.200 --> 06:53.602
Victim's name's Cristin Morehouse.
Age 32. She's the store manager.

06:54.066 --> 06:56.431
Looks like she died from blunt
force trauma to the head.

06:57.489 --> 07:00.914
The weapon was most likely a large,
stainless steel thermos they found near the body.

07:01.792 --> 07:02.804
They sell them here.

07:03.112 --> 07:05.226
Any theories on how
the perpetrator gained entry?

07:05.358 --> 07:07.914
We still don't know but there's a couple
of hundred missing from the register.

07:08.168 --> 07:09.325
So is that official?

07:09.677 --> 07:11.329
Are we characterizing
this as a robbery gone bad?

07:11.443 --> 07:13.247
I  mean, can I give that to the press?

07:14.103 --> 07:16.673
Wait a second...
who robs a store at 6:00 in the morning?

07:16.758 --> 07:18.548
There's no real money
at 6:00 in the morning.

07:19.035 --> 07:20.548
What did he still, her change?

07:23.399 --> 07:24.472
I'm sorry.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.088
I shouldn't have... I just...

07:28.540 --> 07:30.639
God, I would kill for a coffee.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.710
What are you doing?

07:40.167 --> 07:41.427
What have you got in there?

07:42.092 --> 07:43.940
This isn't your room anymore, Ariel.

07:44.188 --> 07:46.494
It's still my house, and if you
have something in there,

07:46.555 --> 07:47.989
I have the right to know what it is.

07:48.205 --> 07:49.119
No, you don't.

07:49.806 --> 07:52.195
Fine, then let's get dad.

07:52.659 --> 07:53.816
Can you keep a secret?

07:54.009 --> 07:54.837
I don't know...

07:55.397 --> 07:57.136
show me what's in
 the closet and I'll tell you.

08:03.063 --> 08:04.437
Dad!

08:11.786 --> 08:12.576
Hello?

08:13.176 --> 08:14.231
You're home.

08:14.684 --> 08:16.740
You figured that out, huh?

08:18.059 --> 08:20.252
Uh, have you been in the garage yet?

08:21.236 --> 08:22.917
Come on, man, do your thing.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.181
Time's a-wastin'.

08:29.470 --> 08:30.684
I hate dogs.

08:33.972 --> 08:34.808
Come on.

08:35.033 --> 08:35.714
Yes, sir.

08:36.321 --> 08:37.065
7:30.

08:38.801 --> 08:40.200
I'll be happy to go with you.

08:41.687 --> 08:42.482
Good night.

08:44.905 --> 08:47.761
My boss wants me to go to
a memorial service,

08:48.052 --> 08:49.645
tomorrow, for Cristin Morehouse.

08:50.524 --> 08:52.090
Apparently there's going
to be a lot press there

08:52.132 --> 08:54.597
and since I'm the one who found the body...

08:55.255 --> 08:55.756
Hmm.

08:56.162 --> 08:58.624
So you can handle the kids
tomorrow, and the dog?

08:58.861 --> 09:01.155
I left the patio door open.
Maybe he'll run away.

09:01.472 --> 09:02.351
You did not.

09:02.637 --> 09:03.662
All right, I did not.

09:04.503 --> 09:05.514
But what are we going to do?

09:05.807 --> 09:07.985
We're gonna make flyers,
see if he belongs to anyone.

09:08.229 --> 09:10.218
Okay, what if he does? 
What do we do then?

09:10.968 --> 09:13.020
Bridgette's already
completely attached to him.

09:13.583 --> 09:16.861
I heard her tell Marie that she wanted
to marry him and have his puppies.

09:18.314 --> 09:19.515
I'm serious.

09:19.152 --> 09:20.518
There's no winning on this.

09:20.523 --> 09:22.628
Either his owner comes to claim him

09:22.718 --> 09:25.908
and then I got to rip the dog out
of our sobbing daughter's arms,

09:26.011 --> 09:27.336
or he doesn't come to claim him

09:27.847 --> 09:31.141
and we're stuck with that mangy
mutt until Marie goes to college

09:31.575 --> 09:34.030
and I can lure him under
the wheels of a passing truck.

09:35.303 --> 09:37.063
God is gonna get you.

09:37.309 --> 09:39.851
All right, forget the passing truck.
I'll put something in his food.

09:40.269 --> 09:42.329
It's much more humane.
He won't feel a thing.

09:42.946 --> 09:44.758
You're such a liar.

09:45.194 --> 09:47.615
- You love that dog.
- I do not.

09:47.673 --> 09:49.029
- I do not.
- I know you do.

09:49.248 --> 09:52.324
All right, so who's gonna
make the flyers, me or you?

09:52.566 --> 09:53.440
I'll do it tomorrow.

09:53.691 --> 09:55.060
Do you think maybe
I should give him a bath?

09:56.942 --> 09:58.410
A little doggy bath?

09:58.957 --> 10:00.922
Hose him down, filthy little critter.

10:05.825 --> 10:06.694
Come here.

10:07.510 --> 10:10.601
Oh! What are you doing?

10:10.643 --> 10:12.761
I don't want your spit on me.

10:12.823 --> 10:13.714
Do you want them to give you a job?

10:13.935 --> 10:17.311
Well, people don't hire people who
don't wipe their mouths after they eat.

10:18.467 --> 10:19.289
You look nice.

10:21.004 --> 10:22.600
Go get 'em, kid.

10:23.058 --> 10:23.863
Thank you.

10:25.279 --> 10:25.840
You're crazy.

10:42.722 --> 10:43.374
What?

10:44.310 --> 10:46.433
Oh, I don't know. This.

10:47.682 --> 10:49.909
I've just put on this dark
suit too many times,

10:50.050 --> 10:52.260
been driven to too many
memorials, listened to

10:52.764 --> 10:56.794
too  many politicians promise way too often
that whoever it was didn't die in vain.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.007
That now we're going
to do something different,

10:59.080 --> 11:00.512
now we're gonna make it safe.

11:01.413 --> 11:04.561
Even made the speech
myself a couple of times.

11:05.401 --> 11:06.107
Sorry.

11:06.697 --> 11:09.048
It's just I know we'll never
get these two hours back.

11:09.661 --> 11:10.905
Still no leads?

11:11.069 --> 11:11.803
One.

11:11.862 --> 11:14.735
Turns  out Cristin Morehouse and her
husband were going through a bad time.

11:14.980 --> 11:16.934
Police were even called
to the apartment twice.

11:17.311 --> 11:18.966
He finally moved out about month ago.

11:19.201 --> 11:20.332
What are you saying?

11:20.815 --> 11:22.399
I'm not sure I'm really saying anything.

11:22.477 --> 11:25.044
Just a really smart lady asked me yesterday

11:25.638 --> 11:27.567
"Who robs a store at 6:00 in the morning?"

11:27.642 --> 11:28.794
It got me thinking. Kids

11:29.131 --> 11:31.565
or someone she knew that, uh,

11:32.010 --> 11:33.723
really wasn't interested
in the money at all.

11:39.443 --> 11:40.302
Morning.

11:40.841 --> 11:42.244
It's the new Deputy Mayor.

11:42.431 --> 11:43.639
Congratulations,by the way.

11:43.787 --> 11:44.553
Thank you.

11:44.970 --> 11:47.268
I think. I'll let you know in an hour or so.

11:47.325 --> 11:48.489
You'll do great.

11:48.597 --> 11:49.643
It's a memorial.

11:49.856 --> 11:51.427
It's not like anyone's charging admission.

11:51.531 --> 11:55.270
Just tell them that you're going to catch
the bad guys and make the streets safe again.

11:55.863 --> 11:57.292
Hit 'em with the task force thing.

11:57.570 --> 11:59.485
They love the task force thing.

12:00.698 --> 12:03.509
The Mayor, the District Attorney
and the Chief of Police

12:03.660 --> 12:08.118
are all keenly aware that robbery
and, yes, even murder,

12:08.369 --> 12:11.829
have become far too
matter-of-fact in Saguaro Heights.

12:12.484 --> 12:13.616
With that in mind,

12:13.750 --> 12:16.484
the Mayor has authorized
a special task force

12:16.885 --> 12:18.996
charged with addressing neighborhood crime

12:19.122 --> 12:21.034
in the Saguaro Heights area.

12:22.345 --> 12:23.603
Found the husband.

12:24.168 --> 12:25.304
He's coming in to talk.

12:26.559 --> 12:27.985
And here comes the press.

12:27.994 --> 12:28.832
James.

12:28.971 --> 12:31.627
This is Allison Dubois.
She works in my office.

12:31.744 --> 12:34.704
You might want to speak with her.
She's the one who actually discovered the body.

12:35.057 --> 12:35.911
Excuse me.

12:36.003 --> 12:36.986
Is that true?

12:37.033 --> 12:39.596
Uh... uh-huh. Yesterday morning.

12:39.960 --> 12:45.156
Uh... I-I couldn't sleep so I woke up
early and I was looking for a coffee place.

12:45.412 --> 12:47.520
As someone who works
in the prosecutor's office,

12:47.604 --> 12:51.416
do you think there's any truth to the charge
by locals that this area is under-policed?

12:51.523 --> 12:54.281
That some of the wealthier communities
in the town get more city protection?

12:57.113 --> 12:58.372
Ma'am would you answer to that ?

13:02.931 --> 13:03.972
Ma'am?

13:09.043 --> 13:10.758
You're saying you haven't
seen your wife since...

13:11.100 --> 13:12.205
A week ago Saturday.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.956
She called and said there was
a problem with the garbage disposal.

13:15.053 --> 13:16.195
I went over to the house to fix it.

13:16.686 --> 13:20.152
I mean, it's my house, too.
She's still my wife.

13:20.979 --> 13:22.522
I mean...

13:24.031 --> 13:26.074
she was.

13:28.596 --> 13:29.639
If you don't mind my asking,

13:29.997 --> 13:32.106
What exactly was the trouble
between you and your wife?

13:32.358 --> 13:33.487
So what's your sense of him?

13:33.796 --> 13:35.062
Excuse me?

13:35.303 --> 13:36.864
Our guys here, what do you think?

13:39.622 --> 13:40.879
I don't really have a sense.

13:42.384 --> 13:44.861
But mostly it was the kids thing.

13:45.978 --> 13:47.344
We  both wanted kids.

13:50.447 --> 13:53.004
There were problems.

13:54.988 --> 13:57.195
No matter what we did,
we couldn't seem to get pregnant.

13:58.153 --> 14:00.058
Well, that must have been tough on both of you.

14:00.892 --> 14:01.936
She blamed herself.

14:02.874 --> 14:04.015
Way before I knew her, she...

14:05.111 --> 14:06.321
I mean...

14:08.538 --> 14:10.005
she had problems with drugs.

14:11.490 --> 14:13.659
- But she wouldn't talk about it...
- A place like The Coffee Palace.

14:14.275 --> 14:15.967
They have to have employee files.

14:16.748 --> 14:18.684
Is there any way I could get a look at those?

14:18.843 --> 14:20.794
Job applications-- that kind of thing?

14:21.238 --> 14:24.296
I think Lee's already ahead of you
on this. I saw the files on his desk.

14:25.112 --> 14:26.958
Feel free to have a look at
them when we're done here.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.695
Jessie Andrews.

15:06.056 --> 15:06.860
Wow.

15:07.936 --> 15:11.826
So, I mean, by that point,
I already had his address.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.176
Wait a second, you didn't
actually go there, did you?

15:15.538 --> 15:16.539
How could I not?

15:17.305 --> 15:20.100
I mean, I didn't actually go up
to his door and knock.

15:20.730 --> 15:23.076
But I drove by. I parked across the street.

15:23.864 --> 15:25.209
Al, Al, Al.

15:25.824 --> 15:26.888
How could I not?

15:27.314 --> 15:30.237
See where he lives,
see the color of his house,

15:30.665 --> 15:33.827
what his street looks like,
who his neighbors might be.

15:34.093 --> 15:35.984
Al, it's easy-- you just don't go.

15:36.239 --> 15:37.838
You don't understand.

15:38.052 --> 15:39.350
No, Allison, I do.

15:39.501 --> 15:40.740
I understand completely.

15:40.917 --> 15:43.291
You had a dream about our unborn child.

15:43.532 --> 15:46.888
And in that dream,
our unborn child looked a lot like

15:46.926 --> 15:49.443
this kid that you saw at this memorial service.

15:49.551 --> 15:51.819
And that's it-- that's the whole connection.

15:54.050 --> 15:55.243
Look, Allison...

15:56.986 --> 15:58.275
take a step back.

15:58.941 --> 16:00.215
Get a little perspective.

16:01.022 --> 16:04.344
Joe, he looked exactly like...

16:04.444 --> 16:06.280
Fine, but that doesn't
mean that he's our son.

16:06.739 --> 16:08.615
That doesn't mean that he's anything to us,

16:08.737 --> 16:10.520
except a kid in a dream.

16:11.659 --> 16:14.257
Look, you go to this coffee shop once,
maybe twice a month, right?

16:15.404 --> 16:18.877
Well, isn't it possible that you saw him there
and that you just don't remember?

16:19.068 --> 16:23.368
And that you bore his face, and you put it...
you gave it to the kid in your dream?

16:25.285 --> 16:28.313
Daddy, Angus is scratching at the patio door!

16:28.464 --> 16:29.588
Yeah, I'll be right there, Bridge.

16:32.494 --> 16:33.951
Look, I-I'm sorry.

16:34.103 --> 16:36.523
I... I know that you're
going through something,

16:36.731 --> 16:40.257
and I want to...
I want to say something to make it...

16:40.367 --> 16:41.947
I don't know,not hurt so bad.

16:44.951 --> 16:46.156
Mom! Mom!

16:48.619 --> 16:49.416
Brian!

16:50.787 --> 16:52.592
It's Mrs. Morehouse-- she's dead!

16:53.003 --> 16:55.702
I'm sorry! She's just dead!

16:55.870 --> 16:57.410
What are you talking about? What happened?

16:58.085 --> 16:58.553
Brian...

16:59.882 --> 17:01.597
Brian, answer me!

17:02.041 --> 17:03.223
Why were you there?!

17:03.475 --> 17:05.228
You are not supposed to go there anymore!

17:05.488 --> 17:06.685
What were you thinking?!

17:07.145 --> 17:07.747
Brian!

17:12.921 --> 17:13.695
Brian.

17:28.793 --> 17:30.021
Okay... okay...

17:31.714 --> 17:34.162
Okay, we-we-we've got
everything under control now.

17:39.285 --> 17:41.811
I'll take care of your clothes.

17:47.827 --> 17:48.986
You finish your bath.

17:52.576 --> 17:53.974
And when you're done with your bath...

17:58.827 --> 18:00.033
I want you to take a shower.

18:00.893 --> 18:02.097
And when you're done with your shower,

18:02.821 --> 18:04.097
I want you to take another bath.

18:04.922 --> 18:05.508
And...

18:06.869 --> 18:08.021
when you're all finished...

18:12.831 --> 18:14.041
call me in and I'll...

18:15.197 --> 18:16.333
I'll clean everything up.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.171
Oh...

18:29.722 --> 18:30.458
Hello.

18:31.034 --> 18:31.756
Good morning.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.143
This is your official civil servant wake-up call.

18:34.816 --> 18:37.055
Mr. District Attorney.

18:37.427 --> 18:39.923
I  think we have a viable suspect
in the Morehouse case.

18:40.155 --> 18:42.366
And I've just authorized
Detective Scanlon to make contact

18:42.547 --> 18:44.961
and see if we can't bring him in here
and have a conversation.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.226
And I was hoping you might be able to join us.

18:47.566 --> 18:49.566
Wait a second, I'm confused.
What about the husband?

18:50.130 --> 18:51.797
The husband has a rock-solid alibi.

18:52.180 --> 18:54.928
Turns out he was with a woman
the morning of the murder.

18:55.140 --> 18:57.981
A married woman, no less.
And not withstanding

18:58.030 --> 18:59.843
the obvious embarassement for all involvment,

19:00.013 --> 19:01.502
she's willing to corroborate his whereabouts.

19:01.777 --> 19:03.885
I expect to hear  from Scanlon any minute.

19:03.998 --> 19:06.569
I wanted him to speak with this kid
before he left home to go to school.

19:07.244 --> 19:09.205
A kid?

19:09.637 --> 19:12.627
Yeah, we're zeroing in on one of the suspects
who worked there, if you can believe it.

19:13.249 --> 19:17.770
A boy named Andrews. Uh, Jessie Andrews.

19:24.785 --> 19:28.977
I don't know. I mean,
I figured the first boss I'd have

19:29.056 --> 19:31.921
would be some big fat guy who'd yell at me.

19:32.957 --> 19:36.367
And she wasn't like that.
She was really nice and-and pretty

19:36.659 --> 19:39.614
and... you could talk to her about stuff.

19:41.396 --> 19:43.277
She'd just talk back to you.

19:44.781 --> 19:47.388
I don't know, I-I really...
I really liked it there.

19:47.417 --> 19:48.570
She made it really nice.

19:48.947 --> 19:51.005
Some of the other kids said
you were buying her things.

19:52.426 --> 19:53.562
It was for her birthday.

19:53.686 --> 19:55.431
The other kids told him
that it was her birthday,

19:55.560 --> 19:56.754
so he brought her some perfume.

19:57.189 --> 20:00.801
It's nice, that's a very nice
thing for a young man to do.

20:00.980 --> 20:02.074
You should be very proud.

20:03.596 --> 20:05.115
Okay, so you bought her some perfume.

20:06.417 --> 20:08.409
Um, he didn't really buy it. He...

20:09.097 --> 20:12.367
borrowed it from my dresser. I mean...

20:14.610 --> 20:15.643
It was expensive.

20:17.252 --> 20:19.255
I think she was a little thrown by it.

20:20.184 --> 20:25.061
Jessie, do you think that contributed
to her decision to let you go?

20:26.786 --> 20:27.837
You guys know about that?

20:28.025 --> 20:30.800
We looked at your employee file
and some of your former colleagues

20:30.957 --> 20:33.494
filled us in on what happened, yes.

20:34.952 --> 20:36.313
I think it was both ways.

20:37.118 --> 20:41.568
I think... I mean, maybe I wasn't
concentrating enough at work, 'cause...

20:43.904 --> 20:47.406
I like... talking to her.

20:49.940 --> 20:53.550
But I also think that she really
liked talking to me when I was around.

20:53.688 --> 20:55.972
So, I don't know, I guess...

20:57.273 --> 20:58.814
I don't-I don't blame her.

20:59.512 --> 21:01.628
So you weren't mad at her?

21:01.749 --> 21:04.938
I mean, when she we was still alive
you weren't angry with her, right?

21:05.408 --> 21:07.235
No. God, no. I just...

21:09.301 --> 21:09.964
missed her.

21:13.299 --> 21:14.335
I still miss her.

21:15.575 --> 21:16.394
Okay?

21:18.498 --> 21:21.507
So, she fired you.

21:22.628 --> 21:23.892
But you didn't stay away.

21:26.132 --> 21:30.221
Obviously, Jessie didn't handle things
as well as he might have.

21:30.419 --> 21:32.565
He didn't tell me that he'd been fired at first.

21:32.984 --> 21:36.728
I think perhaps he was embarrassed.

21:38.344 --> 21:42.206
Be that as it may, it's our understanding
that things got a bit emotional.

21:43.205 --> 21:44.673
It was his first job.

21:45.079 --> 21:46.204
He didn't want to lose it.

21:46.504 --> 21:47.329
Of course not.

21:48.812 --> 21:52.220
Jessie, could you tell us where you were
Wednesday morning between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m.?

21:55.456 --> 21:59.561
Is my son being accused of something here?

21:59.797 --> 22:01.348
No one is being accused of anything.

22:01.511 --> 22:04.057
Every employee at The Coffee Palace
has been interviewed

22:04.184 --> 22:06.743
and every employee at The Coffee Palace
has answered that question.

22:07.092 --> 22:10.112
If you'd like to stop and
find Jessie an attorney,

22:10.478 --> 22:11.462
we'll certainly understand.

22:11.661 --> 22:13.806
But in my opinion,
if he has nothing to hide,

22:14.030 --> 22:17.671
then it would be a foolish waste of
time and money.  But it is up to you.

22:25.296 --> 22:26.310
Go ahead, Jess.

22:26.589 --> 22:28.727
- I was sleeping at home.
- Can anybody verify that?

22:29.051 --> 22:32.570
I can. I got home from
the hospital around 4:30.

22:32.648 --> 22:33.341
In the morning?

22:33.553 --> 22:36.017
I had performed an emergency C-section.
I'm an obstetrician.

22:36.191 --> 22:39.224
Anyway, I peeked in on him,
as I always do, and there he was.

22:40.513 --> 22:42.424
Was there anybody else at home with you, Dr. Andrews?

22:42.676 --> 22:43.182
No.

22:43.380 --> 22:44.757
I'm not married, Detective.

22:44.857 --> 22:47.622
It's just the two of us,

22:48.500 --> 22:50.489
Jessie and me.

22:51.334 --> 22:52.903
May I ask what size shoe you wear, Jessie?

22:53.063 --> 22:53.812
Excuse me.

22:54.631 --> 22:56.995
Did you ask all the other employees that?

22:57.652 --> 23:00.888
Dr. Andrews, I'm sure you read the papers,

23:01.292 --> 23:04.486
and I'm sure you know how much pressure
we're all under to get to the bottom of this.

23:05.165 --> 23:09.416
But we can't do that until we can eliminate all
the people that had contact with Mrs. Morehouse.

23:13.485 --> 23:16.097
We found footprints in the
victim's blood at the scene.

23:17.056 --> 23:19.935
The tread marks indicate they came from a pair of size nine sneakers.

23:20.142 --> 23:23.570
I'm no detective, but aren't there
a lot of people who wear size nine?

23:24.175 --> 23:24.988
Thank you.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.445
You ever own a pair of Z-Jams, Jess?

23:27.786 --> 23:28.915
You don't have to answer that.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.922
We came down here voluntarily
to help your investigation.

23:33.264 --> 23:36.652
If you're going to make my son out
as a suspect, I will find a lawyer.

23:36.764 --> 23:38.481
That's absolutely your prerogative, Dr. Andrews.

23:40.131 --> 23:42.709
- I wouldn't hurt her...
- No. Not another word, Jess.

24:29.186 --> 24:32.277
Mom, Bridgette's giving Angus our breakfast.

24:32.448 --> 24:33.076
Bridgette...

24:33.431 --> 24:35.362
Angus has his food and we have ours.

24:36.132 --> 24:37.173
Just checked my cell.

24:37.513 --> 24:39.683
No calls overnight to claim our friend here.

24:40.138 --> 24:41.718
Does that mean we get to keep him?

24:42.408 --> 24:43.106
Uh-oh.

24:46.208 --> 24:48.547
You know what, let's just
take it one step at a time.

24:49.197 --> 24:50.279
Give it a few more days.

24:59.107 --> 25:00.139
Nobody wants that dog.

25:00.423 --> 25:01.450
Bridgette wants that dog.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.919
I guess I got to go find a truck.

25:06.509 --> 25:07.064
So, what are you thinking?

25:07.261 --> 25:09.751
I'm thinking that maybe
I'll drop him off at the vet

25:10.976 --> 25:12.449
on my way to work this morning,

25:12.911 --> 25:15.196
do some due diligence,
see if he's got all his shots.

25:15.856 --> 25:19.483
At least that way, if we decide to keep him,
we'd know what to expect.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.699
Hey, good looking, what's cooking?

25:28.719 --> 25:29.474
Fish.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.321
You want to check this place out with me?

25:33.745 --> 25:35.838
I really appreciate you staying
open these extra 15 minutes.

25:36.126 --> 25:38.277
I tried to get off work early and then the phone rang...

25:38.219 --> 25:39.176
No, no, no, no.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.234
When they explained to me that you
and Angus were new clients...

25:43.607 --> 25:45.949
Mr. Dubois, did you say this dog was a stray?

25:46.785 --> 25:50.795
Well, yeah. My daughter brought
him home a few days ago.

25:51.178 --> 25:53.387
So, she's not too attached to him then?

25:54.462 --> 25:55.547
She's, well...

25:57.085 --> 25:58.386
You know kids, she's, uh...

25:59.188 --> 26:00.388
she's very attached.

26:01.512 --> 26:03.073
Are you saying he belongs to somebody else?

26:03.916 --> 26:05.143
I'm saying that he's sick.

26:05.911 --> 26:07.059
He's sick? What's wrong with him?

26:07.359 --> 26:08.659
Well, for starters,

26:09.278 --> 26:11.248
I'd say he's about 12 years old.

26:11.642 --> 26:15.291
So in dog years, that's... 84. He's 84?

26:15.477 --> 26:18.497
Well, the age thing is not
an exact science, but...

26:18.853 --> 26:20.119
it's about right, yeah.

26:20.967 --> 26:24.466
Even with a simple examination,
I can tell you that his liver's enlarged,

26:24.638 --> 26:26.637
his eyesight is going, and...

26:26.906 --> 26:29.129
his breathing is clearly labored.

26:30.667 --> 26:32.115
Is he going to be okay?

26:33.282 --> 26:34.512
I wish I had better news.

26:36.844 --> 26:39.776
So what are you saying?
Are you saying, he's going to die?

26:40.937 --> 26:42.050
I'm afraid so.

26:44.287 --> 26:45.512
How long?

26:46.954 --> 26:50.373
Anywhere from a week to a week and a half.

26:52.559 --> 26:53.620
When do you want to tell her?

26:54.538 --> 26:55.636
Do we have to tell her?

26:58.276 --> 26:59.296
I don't know.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.327
I'll give you a hundred dollars if you'll do it.

27:04.757 --> 27:05.159
No, thanks.

27:06.275 --> 27:09.121
I fear I've already destroyed
one child's life for the day.

27:09.409 --> 27:10.611
One is my limit.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.463
Good news and bad news.

27:19.135 --> 27:20.462
I'll take any news at this point.

27:21.646 --> 27:23.284
The good news is we tested the clothes.

27:23.452 --> 27:25.008
Blood came from Cristin Morehouse.

27:25.156 --> 27:27.605
And the sneakers match the
footprints from the crime scene.

27:28.311 --> 27:31.396
A laundry tag on the shirt is
traceable back to Jessie Andrews.

27:32.212 --> 27:34.151
We got a squad car on the way
to pick him up right now.

27:34.851 --> 27:37.613
And the bad news is, obviously,
we haven't gotten to the bottom

27:37.778 --> 27:39.338
of the bigger crime problem
in the neighborhood,

27:39.514 --> 27:41.066
but I'll take my victorieswhere I can get them.

27:41.762 --> 27:42.565
Allison?

27:44.678 --> 27:48.670
Congratulations. If you'll excuse me,
I'm not feeling terribly well.

27:55.424 --> 27:56.462
Feeling any better?

27:57.485 --> 27:58.363
I'm sorry?

27:59.575 --> 28:01.040
I asked if you were feeling any better.

28:01.197 --> 28:02.766
You said you were going
to leave almost two hours ago.

28:03.308 --> 28:06.417
Well, to answer your question, no,
I don't-I don't feel any better.

28:06.799 --> 28:07.851
I feel horrible.

28:11.682 --> 28:16.459
You asked me the other day if I though that
boy was innocent and I didn't say anything.

28:17.793 --> 28:23.903
Because, honestly, everything that I
dreamed tells me that he is guilty as hell.

28:25.133 --> 28:26.702
But what I can't make sense of...

28:29.789 --> 28:31.460
is everything I feel...

28:34.066 --> 28:35.624
tells me to protect him.

28:36.568 --> 28:38.179
Like a parent, like a mother.

28:41.913 --> 28:45.462
For what it's worth, just now when they
brought him in to book him he finally admitted that

28:45.503 --> 28:47.176
he did go see Morehouse that morning.

28:47.552 --> 28:49.980
Knew she'd be there all by
herself opening up the store.

28:51.076 --> 28:55.218
Of course, he claimed that she was
already dead when he got there,

28:55.372 --> 28:57.785
not that he called the police or anything.

28:57.839 --> 28:59.222
I mean, if it makes you feel any better.

29:01.433 --> 29:02.693
Well, maybe he's telling the truth.

29:02.806 --> 29:04.172
Maybe she was dead when he found her.

29:04.378 --> 29:04.986
Allison...

29:05.041 --> 29:06.621
Couldn't we at least consider the possibility?

29:07.196 --> 29:10.422
Take another look at the husband,
or the woman that he was seeing?

29:10.564 --> 29:12.626
Maybe she was the one who
wanted Cristin out of the picture.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.269
Okay, I'm going to go back to work now.

29:14.455 --> 29:18.213
Deal with some cases that are truly
unresolved and in need of some attention.

29:18.389 --> 29:19.440
Okay, you know what?

29:19.638 --> 29:21.951
If it's all the same to you,
can I just take another look at the files?

29:24.508 --> 29:25.182
Thank you.

29:29.605 --> 29:31.075
How goes the fine-tooth combing?

29:32.531 --> 29:33.592
Actually, I'm confused.

29:33.804 --> 29:35.350
Your boss mentioned that.

29:35.820 --> 29:36.969
That's not what I'm talking about.

29:38.467 --> 29:41.030
Kevin Morehouse said his wife
wasn't able to have children,

29:41.294 --> 29:42.786
but, according to the coroner's report,

29:43.139 --> 29:47.348
the shape of her uterus is indicative of her
having given birth at some point in her life.

29:48.192 --> 29:49.267
Okay.

29:51.634 --> 29:53.597
Look, I'm not sure where you're
going with this, but you should know,

29:53.698 --> 29:55.883
the kid's lawyer is on his way
down here now to talk deal.

29:58.217 --> 29:59.685
I'm sorry, Allison, but the kid's guilty,

30:00.025 --> 30:01.119
and even his attorney knows it.

30:02.939 --> 30:03.864
Let me tell you what we know.

30:05.524 --> 30:09.237
We know that your client had something
of an obsession with Mrs. Morehouse.

30:09.328 --> 30:12.880
We also know that he had a confrontation
with her the day she died,

30:13.063 --> 30:16.731
and she was upset to the point of calling
the young man's mother to take him home.

30:17.407 --> 30:21.065
We know that a bag of his blood-spattered clothing
was found in a Dumpster earlier this morning,

30:21.191 --> 30:24.270
and the the blood was a perfect
match for that of Mrs. Morehouse.

30:28.638 --> 30:29.988
Now I'll tell you what I think.

30:30.962 --> 30:34.306
I think I have more than enough here
to make a case against your client.

30:35.908 --> 30:38.810
And I think if I try him as an adult,
that the jury won't hesitate

30:39.668 --> 30:40.984
to give him the maximum sentence.

30:45.046 --> 30:48.448
He's barely 15 years old.

30:50.220 --> 30:55.034
You're talking about taking away
the next 30 years of his life.

30:55.621 --> 30:58.441
I'd be lying if I said that Jessie's
age didn't give me pause.

30:59.534 --> 31:02.954
Which is the only reason
that I will consider a deal.

31:03.412 --> 31:05.495
Provided he signs a full confession,

31:05.903 --> 31:07.300
I'll recommend manslaughter.

31:07.674 --> 31:09.751
Four years in a juvenile detention facility.

31:10.188 --> 31:12.913
If, however, you'd rather take this to trial,

31:13.030 --> 31:16.224
know that I will prosecute Jessie as an adult,
and I will seek the maximum.

31:18.195 --> 31:19.410
Feel free to talk it over.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.098
You've got 15 minutes.

31:36.546 --> 31:38.398
How long are you going to do this?

31:39.344 --> 31:42.558
For the rest of my life.
You got an issue with that?

31:42.967 --> 31:46.953
Not me. Just seems like there's going
to be a lot of wasted space in our bed.

31:48.066 --> 31:49.654
Maybe I should put an ad in the paper.

31:49.785 --> 31:51.152
See if I can rent out half.

31:52.513 --> 31:53.756
He confessed to everything.

31:56.343 --> 31:57.546
Did he say why he did it?

32:00.313 --> 32:03.276
The day she called his mother
to pick him up, he was humiliated.

32:03.836 --> 32:05.949
So he decided he didn't want it to end that way.

32:07.755 --> 32:08.777
He set his alarm,

32:10.207 --> 32:12.280
woke up early, went back the next morning,

32:13.514 --> 32:15.100
caught her when she was opening up.

32:16.703 --> 32:17.691
She got upset.

32:19.433 --> 32:20.364
He grabbed a thermos.

32:23.856 --> 32:24.940
And what about his real mom?

32:25.631 --> 32:27.219
Dr. Andrews? What about her?

32:27.508 --> 32:30.164
Did she confess to putting
his clothes in that Dumpster?

32:30.993 --> 32:32.703
No. It didn't come up.

32:33.447 --> 32:34.535
And I didn't say anything.

32:35.632 --> 32:36.658
She's an adult, Joe.

32:36.782 --> 32:38.009
She would have done more time

32:38.329 --> 32:41.203
for being an accessory than he's
going to do for the actual murder.

32:42.009 --> 32:43.110
So she just gets to walk?

32:43.573 --> 32:45.185
She was just trying to protect her kid.

32:46.355 --> 32:50.102
And at least this way she'll be able to be
there for him when he gets out in four years.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.182
And if you want to know the truth,

32:53.207 --> 32:55.668
if it was Ariel or Bridgette or Marie,

32:56.252 --> 32:58.511
I would have done the exact same thing.

33:01.100 --> 33:03.336
Speaking of protecting your kid,
I don't, I don't suppose

33:03.457 --> 33:07.011
you've come up with any bright ideas
for telling our middle child

33:07.174 --> 33:08.345
that her dog is dying.

33:10.130 --> 33:11.437
Yeah. Me, neither.

33:12.750 --> 33:15.593
Well, I got half a bed to try and rent.

33:17.011 --> 33:17.725
See ya.

33:33.639 --> 33:34.764
Jessie's manager?

33:35.436 --> 33:35.907
Uh...

33:36.647 --> 33:37.429
Cristin.

33:38.307 --> 33:39.636
Uh, Mrs. Morehouse.

33:40.491 --> 33:41.469
Dr. Andrews?

33:44.932 --> 33:47.355
I-I am so sorry about Jessie.

33:47.636 --> 33:48.670
Have we met before ?

33:49.366 --> 33:50.611
No, I don't believe we have, no.

33:53.906 --> 33:54.932
Are you sure?

33:55.721 --> 33:57.809
What kind of doctor are
you exactly? If I can ask.

33:58.749 --> 34:01.430
I have to run. I'm due back
at the hospital in 20 minutes.

34:02.004 --> 34:04.383
I'm terribly sorry.
He will not bother you again.

34:07.204 --> 34:08.234
Dr. Andrews?

34:09.751 --> 34:11.094
Dr. Andrews!

34:13.297 --> 34:14.406
Dr. Andrews!

34:17.661 --> 34:19.204
He's mine, isn't he?!

34:19.666 --> 34:20.697
He's mine!

34:21.425 --> 34:22.292
Mine...

34:23.239 --> 34:24.601
He's mine!

34:24.672 --> 34:25.739
What does she mean?

34:26.822 --> 34:27.942
What's she yelling about?

34:28.480 --> 34:29.529
Nothing, honey.

34:29.808 --> 34:31.208
Absolutely nothing.

34:41.114 --> 34:42.636
Come in.

34:45.781 --> 34:47.748
I know I'm a little late.
The hospital was just...

34:48.496 --> 34:49.496
I understand.

34:50.187 --> 34:52.147
I'm glad I caught you
while you were in the city.

34:52.679 --> 34:55.215
No, as soon as you said it might help Jessie...

34:56.067 --> 34:57.099
How's he doing?

34:58.377 --> 35:00.537
As well as can be expected.

35:01.083 --> 35:02.150
Considering.

35:03.146 --> 35:05.910
I just... there's some inconsistencies in here

35:06.020 --> 35:07.822
and I was hoping you could
help me clear them up.

35:08.435 --> 35:11.210
Anything I can tell you.
Anything you want to know.

35:13.141 --> 35:17.152
Uh, Dr. Andrews, the, the night
before Cristin Morehouse died,

35:17.410 --> 35:20.070
the night she called you and
had you come and pick up Jessie,

35:20.179 --> 35:21.703
was that the first time you'd ever met her?

35:22.691 --> 35:24.632
I believe so, yes.

35:25.362 --> 35:26.779
All right. Well, here's the thing.

35:26.929 --> 35:29.570
I was looking through
Cristin's autopsy report,

35:29.753 --> 35:33.577
and apparently she'd given birth
to a child at some point in her life.

35:34.228 --> 35:35.070
All right.

35:35.584 --> 35:38.644
Well, it made me curious because
her husband said that infertility

35:39.618 --> 35:40.961
was a real issue for them.

35:41.625 --> 35:43.811
So I-I did some checking, and I...

35:46.299 --> 35:47.946
came across this death certificate.

35:50.951 --> 35:54.466
Apparently she had  given birth to
a child many years before her marriage.

35:56.178 --> 35:59.988
The baby had died moments
after it came into the world.

36:02.709 --> 36:03.982
What am I looking at here?

36:04.236 --> 36:06.566
You signed the death certificate, Dr. Andrews.

36:07.255 --> 36:08.233
You were there.

36:14.346 --> 36:14.996
All right.

36:16.064 --> 36:17.623
Yes, that's my signature.

36:18.125 --> 36:18.444
It...

36:19.522 --> 36:21.216
15 years ago.

36:22.454 --> 36:23.758
A different last name.

36:24.977 --> 36:27.708
I honestly have no recollection of the woman.

36:28.026 --> 36:30.581
Well, here's another interesting thing--
contradiction-wise.

36:31.679 --> 36:37.892
Apparently, on the night you were
presiding over the death of Cristin's son,

36:39.308 --> 36:39.903
you...

36:42.747 --> 36:45.710
were also giving birth to one of your own.

36:48.783 --> 36:50.397
Dr. Andrews.

36:58.751 --> 37:03.516
15 years ago I was an intern volunteering
a few hours a week at a clinic downtown.

37:05.145 --> 37:08.407
One night a woman stumbled in,
high like most of our patients.

37:08.724 --> 37:10.731
She said she was in a lot of pain,
she didn't know why.

37:12.039 --> 37:15.595
After a short exam, I told her she was eight
months pregnant and she was in labor.

37:15.933 --> 37:16.921
She didn't know.

37:17.053 --> 37:18.341
She didn't want to know.

37:19.344 --> 37:21.496
She told me her whole life
was about doing drugs.

37:21.558 --> 37:23.133
She didn't know who the father was.
She didn't care.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.737
I told her the baby was comingand
she looked at me and said,

37:29.661 --> 37:33.617
people pay a lot for a white baby, right?"

37:35.122 --> 37:37.410
What did I think she could get for it?

37:39.113 --> 37:41.665
She was in pain, so I gave her
something to help her sleep,

37:42.486 --> 37:44.494
and an hour later, Jessie came into the world.

37:46.419 --> 37:48.094
I cleaned him up, wrapped him in a blanket,

37:48.228 --> 37:50.898
and I was going to call the police,
but he was shaking so hard.

37:51.032 --> 37:51.642
Shaking?

37:53.173 --> 37:54.862
Jessie was born an addict.

37:56.794 --> 37:58.568
So I just... waited.

37:59.421 --> 38:03.124
And I held him, rocked him
until he quieted down.

38:04.871 --> 38:08.811
I can still feel the weight
of his tiny body in my arms.

38:08.959 --> 38:10.372
I can still see his sweet face.

38:11.157 --> 38:14.028
He was so helpless, and he just
needed someone to take care of him,

38:14.391 --> 38:16.631
someone to protect him, and somehow I knew...

38:17.657 --> 38:19.425
that person had to be me.

38:20.934 --> 38:23.385
My life as I knew it was over.

38:25.032 --> 38:26.763
I gave it to him. I gave him...

38:29.613 --> 38:30.777
everything I had.

38:34.704 --> 38:36.179
You became his mother.

38:56.966 --> 38:58.355
When Cristin woke up,

38:59.679 --> 39:01.372
I told her the baby had died.

39:02.539 --> 39:03.988
I knew what I was doing was wrong,

39:05.114 --> 39:07.621
but I swear to you, Mrs. Dubois,if anything,

39:07.911 --> 39:09.790
she was relieved.

39:10.121 --> 39:13.007
And that's when I knew,
this was the best thing for everybody.

39:13.165 --> 39:14.652
It was certainly the best thing for Jessie.

39:14.798 --> 39:16.108
And you never saw her again.

39:16.390 --> 39:17.846
We moved to Tempe, he and I.

39:18.661 --> 39:19.843
No one knew us, no one cared.

39:21.019 --> 39:22.689
We moved here to Phoenix three years later.

39:22.801 --> 39:26.778
I-I supposed she was long gone,
probably long dead.

39:28.394 --> 39:29.563
And then last week...

39:30.858 --> 39:32.549
I went to The Coffee Palace.

39:35.297 --> 39:36.628
She recognized me.

39:40.272 --> 39:41.588
She told me that she was clean now,

39:41.653 --> 39:43.066
that she could be a good mother to Jessie.

39:43.130 --> 39:44.411
She said she had a right to him.

39:44.491 --> 39:47.515
I begged her to be reasonable, to work with me,

39:49.392 --> 39:49.862
but...

39:51.426 --> 39:53.396
she said she would call the police and...

39:56.885 --> 40:00.406
after that, I don't remember what happened
except she was reaching for the phone and...

40:03.200 --> 40:06.143
I must have hit her. I don't even know.

40:07.522 --> 40:09.077
I was so scared I just left.

40:12.024 --> 40:13.104
I just left her there.

40:13.249 --> 40:14.327
Where Jessie found her,

40:15.247 --> 40:16.892
when he went there hoping to talk to her.

40:22.381 --> 40:23.577
There are people I need to go get.

40:23.748 --> 40:25.199
There are people that we need to tell.

40:31.425 --> 40:35.339
I know you must think I'm a horrible person,
letting him take the blame for what I did.

40:35.429 --> 40:37.865
But you see, I thought, at least this way,

40:38.213 --> 40:40.138
I can be there for him when he gets out.

40:40.203 --> 40:41.258
And now...

40:47.183 --> 40:48.586
he'll go into foster care.

40:49.822 --> 40:54.341
And the only mother he's ever known
will spend the rest of her life apart from him.

41:01.367 --> 41:02.650
Ask yourself, Mrs. Dubois:

41:04.079 --> 41:08.101
Would you have done any
differently if you were in my shoes?

41:17.478 --> 41:18.824
I'll be right back.

41:30.199 --> 41:31.558
So you ready to do this?

41:33.107 --> 41:35.100
How did I get roped into this?

41:35.582 --> 41:37.359
Thank you. I appreciate your support.

41:38.736 --> 41:39.633
Bridge.

41:39.946 --> 41:41.497
We need to talk to you about something.

41:41.628 --> 41:42.711
Am I in trouble?

41:42.923 --> 41:44.295
You mind if I turn off the TV?

41:45.103 --> 41:46.113
What'd I do?

41:47.790 --> 41:50.799
Hey, Bridge, do you remember when
I took Angus to the vet the other day?

41:52.422 --> 41:54.892
Uh, well, it turns out Angus isn't really okay.

41:56.184 --> 41:57.546
I'm afraid he's very sick.

41:58.934 --> 42:00.201
He doesn't have long to live.

42:00.599 --> 42:01.695
Yeah, I know.

42:02.719 --> 42:03.783
You know?

42:03.960 --> 42:04.726
Sure.

42:04.801 --> 42:06.502
I knew the second I saw him.

42:07.135 --> 42:08.779
He's very old, you know.

42:10.333 --> 42:13.797
Bridge, honey, if you
knew he was going to die,

42:13.869 --> 42:15.512
why did you ask if we could keep him?

42:16.080 --> 42:18.229
Bridge, honey, why didn't you say something?

42:18.724 --> 42:21.430
Because I knew how much you liked him, Daddy.

42:21.827 --> 42:24.035
And I didn't want to see you all sad.

42:25.366 --> 42:27.509
I don't think I could've handled it.

42:30.421 --> 42:31.344
Aha.

42:31.849 --> 42:34.921
Can me and Angus have our cartoons back now?

42:44.474 --> 42:46.037
Did I mention I hate dogs?

42:46.203 --> 42:47.463
Once or twice.

42:48.599 --> 42:53.552
