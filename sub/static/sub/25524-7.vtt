00:01.320 --> 00:02.680
The man with your sister,

00:02.719 --> 00:04.440
I saw him with a bloody knife.

00:05.720 --> 00:07.320
I cannot say it any clearer,

00:07.400 --> 00:08.320
this man is a killer!

00:08.400 --> 00:10.000
So am I. Be silent

00:10.080 --> 00:11.560
or your lovely daughter hangs.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.720
There's a little Quiggy
growing inside me.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.880
You've taken my family from me.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.800
I want you to lose
your family too.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.600
I hate you.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.000
I'm taking her home.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.800
My secret is a child.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.160
She is his.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.440
I want news of Amelia.

00:28.480 --> 00:29.920
Take care of things for me.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.200
I confess to the murder
of Sir George Howard.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.000
I have the Wells girl
as my surety.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.120
And witnesses can perish.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.760
Tell Charlotte
I've gone to bed.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.400
I can tell you
the name of the man

00:39.520 --> 00:40.600
who stabbed Amelia.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.080
It is Lord Fallon.

02:13.880 --> 02:18.000
Amelia is at God's mercy,

02:18.080 --> 02:20.120
but Margaret Wells is at yours.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.560
I don't know if I am
to offer you payment.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.000
Not unless you would offend.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.880
It was a gift.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.960
One I took great pleasure
in giving.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.520
Will your companion
not have breakfast with us?

02:45.560 --> 02:46.976
Culls come to brothels
for something

02:47.000 --> 02:48.360
warmer and wetter than bread.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.160
She's not my cull.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.000
Nor is she my beloved.

02:55.080 --> 02:56.680
Friendship has many faces.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.960
Lydia will come for me.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.880
As surely as day
turns to night.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.280
Margaret is too long
visiting Amelia Scanwell.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.120
I will chase her.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.880
You offer me freedom on
condition of my silence?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.280
No, Abigail,
I want you to sing your song

03:21.400 --> 03:22.360
of kidnap and rape

03:22.400 --> 03:24.400
to the Lord Chief Justice.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.720
But he will hang you.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.720
Not when you tell him
it was Charlotte Wells

03:28.840 --> 03:30.280
who ensnared and pimped you.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.560
I would die before
I would become your helper.

03:34.360 --> 03:38.120
lf death is the worst thing
you can contemplate,

03:38.240 --> 03:40.520
you have not yet
known suffering.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.280
A girl was stabbed
in the street yesterday.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.720
Mercifully, she clings to life.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.560
What concern is it of mine?

04:03.600 --> 04:06.720
I believe it was you
that cut her down.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.680
I'm taking you to justice.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.560
Unless you have
a hundred reputable men

04:11.680 --> 04:14.840
to declare it,

04:14.960 --> 04:17.040
you are making a mistake.

04:17.160 --> 04:20.600
Will you dress
or come as you are?

04:20.720 --> 04:22.280
The Magistrate has come for me.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.560
I'm accused of assailing
the Scanwell girl.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.000
Your mother's lies
have taken root.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.920
You think she has caused this?

04:31.800 --> 04:34.040
You must go to
the Marquess of Blayne.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.160
Tell him that I am persecuted.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.920
I struggle
to believe it of her.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.840
These past days...

04:49.480 --> 04:51.480
have been heaven.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.360
You speak as though
they are over.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.040
I pray they are not.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.000
You're as soft as a kitten's
belly, Lord Fallon.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.120
Don't tell anyone.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.240
You creep home like
a befouled alley cat.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.400
I'm utterly spent.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.120
You'll excuse me while I sleep.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.120
You'll do no such thing.
I've arranged an outing.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.016
Well, it will wait.
lf you are not in your carriage

05:42.040 --> 05:43.240
in ten minutes

05:43.280 --> 05:45.600
I will drag you there
in your stays.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.560
Mr. North is here
for Mrs. Wells.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.600
Mrs. Scanwell.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.600
You do not know.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.480
Mrs. Wells confessed
to the slaying

06:05.600 --> 06:07.000
of Sir George Howard.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.360
No.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.480
She has been taken
to her reckoning.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.360
I hope I am detained

06:37.480 --> 06:39.480
on more than that woman's word.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.400
Mrs. Wells has thrown herself
upon a bonfire

06:42.480 --> 06:46.840
in the hope of dragging
a ddemon with her.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.800
I wish I were so brave.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.920
You're mistaken.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.360
They'll take her
to Newgate tomorrow

07:03.400 --> 07:04.800
and hang her soon after.

07:06.720 --> 07:07.800
I'm sorry.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.720
Why has she done it, Nance?

07:17.240 --> 07:20.360
I'll go to Lady Fitz.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.560
Implore her
to use her influence.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.040
Will you tell Lucy?

07:26.040 --> 07:28.040
Your ma will want to see ya.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.120
You give her comfort

07:30.160 --> 07:31.400
and I'll find a cure.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.280
Lucy, are you there?

07:35.360 --> 07:36.360
Lucy!

07:44.840 --> 07:47.160
Why, Margaret?

07:47.240 --> 07:50.560
Lucy told Fallon
she stabbed Sir George.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.920
He threatened
to use it against her.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.720
We could've found a way
to mute him.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.360
I'd have done so with my fists
to avoid this.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.600
Her secret weighed upon her.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.920
Even if we'd silenced Fallon

08:05.040 --> 08:06.840
she'd have told someone else
in time.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.240
She is unburdened now.

08:10.360 --> 08:13.120
You have replaced one burden
with another.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.360
And you've given it
to Charlotte too.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.000
And Jacob.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.800
Jacob will want for nothing
with you as his father.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.400
He will want for you!

08:27.480 --> 08:30.480
He will spend his boyhood
craving you

08:30.560 --> 08:33.240
like a hunger
that I cannot sate.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.000
I pray he will forget.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.640
I don't want him to forget!

08:39.720 --> 08:43.600
I want him to know your face,

08:43.640 --> 08:46.120
your laugh, and your love.

08:49.320 --> 08:53.120
The best things I've ever known,

08:53.200 --> 08:55.200
and you've robbed him of them.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.440
Lucy!

09:12.480 --> 09:14.120
Lucy, your ma is in trouble!

09:19.320 --> 09:20.360
Open up, Fallon!

09:20.480 --> 09:22.000
Open up!

09:22.080 --> 09:23.480
Lucy!

09:36.240 --> 09:38.360
What are we doing here?

09:38.440 --> 09:39.840
lt's a vision of your future.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.080
Some of them are
quite entertaining.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.720
That one there
believes it is an animal.

10:06.080 --> 10:09.520
It would require more effort
for me to purchase a new wig

10:09.600 --> 10:11.960
than it would
to intern you here.

10:18.520 --> 10:21.120
lf it is an oath of obedience
you demand,

10:21.200 --> 10:22.480
I will swear it.

10:24.240 --> 10:27.320
What is the secret that the
bawd Quigley torments you with?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.720
How can I reveal that
which does not exist?

10:29.760 --> 10:31.080
I think perhaps
you took a lover

10:31.120 --> 10:32.440
while I was in France.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.200
Am I correct?

10:35.240 --> 10:38.360
Make me believe you, Isabella.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.240
It would pain me
to leave you here.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.760
lt was a woman.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.880
She took me in her mouth
and sucked your venom from me.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.080
I could taste it on her lips.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.840
Her name?

10:54.880 --> 10:56.240
I won't expose her.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.360
Then I'm sure the bawd will.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.440
Well, where is this boy
who claims to have witnessed

11:07.480 --> 11:08.840
the attack on Miss Scanwell?

11:08.960 --> 11:11.240
He has fled,
but he confided in Mrs. Wells

11:11.320 --> 11:12.840
that the assailant
was Lord Fallon.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.120
The same Mrs. Wells
who has confessed

11:15.240 --> 11:16.480
to Sir George's murder!

11:16.600 --> 11:18.000
She wishes to go to her death

11:18.080 --> 11:19.520
with the truth told
in all matters.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.360
Or with a vendetta settled!

11:21.480 --> 11:22.880
lf Lord Fallon is set free,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.080
he might finish the job
he has started.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.720
Miss Scanwell
deserves our protection.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.840
Very well.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.200
But should that girl wake,

11:32.240 --> 11:34.240
she had better confirm
your accusation.

11:36.360 --> 11:40.480
ls there no way to avoid
hanging Margaret Wells?

11:40.520 --> 11:43.480
I believe she acted
to defend her child.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.760
She struck down an aristocrat!

11:46.840 --> 11:49.520
I'm going to have the hangman
tie the rope short.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.840
She'll be nobody's hero

11:50.880 --> 11:53.480
when she's kicking
in her own piss.

12:08.120 --> 12:11.320
A baby is a parasite.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.000
Sucking one's vitality

12:13.080 --> 12:15.600
like marrow from a bone.

12:15.720 --> 12:18.120
You told her!
Mumma is delighted.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.480
I bet she is.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.480
Emily,

12:24.520 --> 12:26.360
if we allow it,

12:26.440 --> 12:27.840
this baby will be the oil

12:27.880 --> 12:30.840
that calms the waters
between us.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.480
Am I to forget
that you sold me as meat

12:33.520 --> 12:35.240
to a pack of snarling mutts?

12:35.360 --> 12:37.360
Just as I must forget
that you conspired

12:37.440 --> 12:39.240
to have me
brought before the law.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.480
For trying to kill me!

12:40.600 --> 12:42.240
lf you will accept it,

12:42.320 --> 12:45.080
the hand of conciliation
is offered to you.

12:45.120 --> 12:48.320
As is the safety and comfort
of Golden Square.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.880
I don't know if you've noticed

12:51.000 --> 12:52.640
but I have
a thriving house here.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.960
Call in your best girl.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Cherry! lt's Harriet!

12:58.120 --> 13:00.480
Harriet!

13:00.600 --> 13:02.640
Yes?

13:05.240 --> 13:07.600
Do you read and write? Yes.

13:07.640 --> 13:10.440
Do you know your numbers
up to 100?

13:10.480 --> 13:12.080
Yes.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.760
lf Miss Lacey and Mr. Quigley

13:13.840 --> 13:15.120
were to move to Golden Square,

13:15.200 --> 13:16.680
would you be willing
to run this house

13:16.720 --> 13:18.320
on their behalf?

13:18.360 --> 13:19.840
lf I'm paid extra.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.600
She has an aptitude
for business.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.240
You may go.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.760
I do hope you will accept
my offer, Emily.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.760
Of course she will!

13:34.520 --> 13:35.720
Charles,

13:35.760 --> 13:37.840
you may have pricked the dough

13:37.960 --> 13:40.240
but it is the baker
who bakes the bread.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.600
Miss Wells,
what a delightful distraction

13:53.640 --> 13:56.480
from the business of the day.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.480
Lord Fallon has been arrested.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.000
A girl was stabbed yesterday
and the magistrate accuses him.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.720
My goodness,
what a dreadful misfortune!

14:03.840 --> 14:05.320
Lord Fallon left me
at Golden Square

14:05.360 --> 14:07.600
to go to his bank yesterday.

14:07.720 --> 14:11.760
Perhaps the banker
can confirm he was there.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.360
Well, I will make enquiries,

14:14.480 --> 14:16.200
and in the meantime.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.720
Lord Lidington will escort you
to the courthouse.

14:18.760 --> 14:22.000
But he will show you
nothing but deference.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.000
I guarantee it.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.600
Good.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.640
How did Lucy take the news?

14:39.720 --> 14:43.440
With shock and silence
like all of us.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.120
You did well
to keep her from coming.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.120
Take her as your own.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.000
Charlotte too.

14:59.240 --> 15:02.840
When we were small,
we only had each other.

15:02.960 --> 15:06.120
And then we grew and you gained
the little 'uns and Will.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.360
But you're still all I have.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.000
Nancy...

15:19.120 --> 15:21.320
Don't ask me to make promises
about what I'll do after

15:21.360 --> 15:23.280
because I don't know if
I'll be fit to keep them.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.840
I should go to Charlotte.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.600
She's asking Lady Fitz
to help you.

15:30.440 --> 15:33.520
Let her run her fool's errands
if it helps her.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.600
I need you here with me.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.720
Till the end.

15:48.960 --> 15:49.960
Charlotte.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.840
You must not come here.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.480
Something's happened?

15:53.520 --> 15:56.720
He threatened me with Bedlam.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.240
I almost gave up my secret.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.480
If he cannot browbeat
the truth from me,

16:01.600 --> 16:04.600
then he will buy it
from Lydia Quigley.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.200
Does she know where Sophia is?

16:06.240 --> 16:07.840
Yes.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.720
We must move her today.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.880
lsabella,
I need something from you.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.240
Help me keep my daughter safe

16:14.360 --> 16:15.856
and I will give you
anything you ask for.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.320
My mother is charged
with murder.

16:18.360 --> 16:21.440
You must intervene on her behalf
and you must do it now.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.480
My brother is closing in.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.960
I don't have time to waste.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.840
You need my help

16:27.960 --> 16:30.000
and I need yours.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.840
Let us work together.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.840
I pride myself on providing
a complete service,

16:38.880 --> 16:42.720
but telling falsehoods
to a magistrate...

16:42.760 --> 16:45.360
I'm sure you will find it
within yourself, Mrs. Quigley.

16:47.240 --> 16:51.240
What a very dear friend
Lord Fallon has in you.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.360
We're members of the same
gentleman's club.

16:54.440 --> 16:58.440
You share a taste
for unbroken girls.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.760
Well, I should think

16:59.840 --> 17:02.120
half the men in London
share that taste.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.480
Yes, but it is
the violent conquest

17:04.560 --> 17:07.640
that you and your friends enjoy.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.280
Isn't that so?

17:10.400 --> 17:12.720
Will you come to the aid
of Lord Fallon?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.480
Just picture it, Emily,

17:24.520 --> 17:26.680
Charles Quigley senior and son,

17:26.720 --> 17:29.200
of Golden Square.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.760
We don't have to call him
Charles.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.800
What's your father's name?

17:40.720 --> 17:41.800
Alphonsus.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.320
Well, we needn't decide it now.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.920
We've made ourselves
a business here.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.800
And we'll still skim the cream.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.320
I don't belong here, Emily.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.240
I want to go home.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.760
I want to take my family home.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.400
I detect ambition
in you, Lydia.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.480
lf you earn my friendship
I will make you procuress

18:12.520 --> 18:14.240
to some of the finest men
in England.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.080
Dukes, princes...

18:18.720 --> 18:21.400
I am, as ever,
your loyal priestess.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.880
Who is the lover my sister
is protecting?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.720
lt's not a lover...

18:29.760 --> 18:31.640
but a bastard.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.720
Goodness.

18:37.760 --> 18:40.240
She hides her in a school

18:40.320 --> 18:44.000
to ensure the father
does not learn of her.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.480
The father?

18:46.560 --> 18:48.520
She doesn't name him.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.640
No aspect of
Isabella's delusions

18:53.720 --> 18:55.280
should be believed.

18:55.400 --> 18:59.200
Arrangements have been made.

18:59.240 --> 19:00.480
Bedlam beckons.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.960
I presume the whereabouts
of the child

19:05.000 --> 19:06.760
are of interest.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.520
Of course.

19:09.640 --> 19:13.520
You should also consider
disarming Charlotte Wells.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.920
She inflames
your sister's lunacy.

19:20.720 --> 19:21.976
Well, then we must
bring her to heel

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
in the manner that
only Spartans can.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.280
Pa, Lady Fitz needs you

19:45.400 --> 19:48.480
to play the part of her servant.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.320
On any other day I'd tell her
to fuck off,

19:50.440 --> 19:52.920
and today doubly so.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.496
I'm trying to tell Jacob
about his ma.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.960
Well, help me
and you might not need to.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.200
You lure him in for a jiggle

20:01.240 --> 20:03.080
and while the two of you
are at it

20:03.200 --> 20:06.720
I'll knock him on the head
and we'll run.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.240
I don't lie with
red haired men.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.960
Since when?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.760
My ma told me
my father was one,

20:11.880 --> 20:12.976
so it was the best way
to ever avoid

20:13.000 --> 20:14.280
tupping him by mistake!

20:14.400 --> 20:17.000
Well, then I'll tup him
and you knock him on the head.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.400
What will he find down there,

20:21.480 --> 20:23.320
cobwebs?

20:23.440 --> 20:25.480
Yeah, a fucking mousetrap!

20:38.880 --> 20:40.920
Miss Wells.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.920
We will finish
hearing from Mrs. Quigley

20:43.000 --> 20:44.920
and then I will ask you
some questions.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.200
Soon after he arrived,

20:49.240 --> 20:51.880
Lord Fallon cut short
Miss Wells' visit

20:51.960 --> 20:53.440
to her older sister

20:53.480 --> 20:56.280
and escorted her
to the carriage.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.560
They both embarked

20:57.680 --> 20:59.480
and to the best of my knowledge

20:59.520 --> 21:01.560
returned home.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.720
Can you confirm this?

21:10.680 --> 21:12.440
Yes.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.440
You both boarded the carriage

21:16.480 --> 21:18.640
and journeyed straight home
without diversion?

21:21.720 --> 21:22.720
We did.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.920
You have my most profound
apologies, Lord Fallon.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.160
I'm sure Justice Hunt
wishes to add his own.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.920
I'm truly sorry
how events have unfolded.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.880
You impertinent wretch!

22:05.800 --> 22:08.080
You have rushed to judgment

22:08.200 --> 22:10.400
and let your envy
of your betters show.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.720
The girl was lying.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.480
II don't for one second
believe you can't see it.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.440
You are unburdened
of this office

22:16.480 --> 22:19.040
with immediate effect.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.200
His demise was overdue.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.280
lt is a shame.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.000
He is not without merit.

22:34.080 --> 22:39.440
Last night he apprehended
Sir George Howard's murderer.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.680
Who is the villain?

22:40.720 --> 22:43.800
She is a villainess.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.920
Margaret Wells.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.760
My sweet angel of deliverance.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.960
I have another errand for you.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.480
There is a young girl
in a school in Chelsea

23:10.560 --> 23:13.320
and I need her brought to me.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.480
She's my niece!

23:21.560 --> 23:23.240
Death has arrived early!

23:27.920 --> 23:29.760
I will speak with you alone.

23:29.880 --> 23:30.880
You will not.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.880
I'll be fine, Nancy.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.160
You vex her,

23:35.240 --> 23:37.440
I'll not be held responsible.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.080
Well,

23:45.200 --> 23:47.320
you've earned yourself
a fitting ending.

23:48.480 --> 23:51.800
May yours be cancer riddled
and long.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.720
Charlotte has put herself
on the black list

23:53.800 --> 23:55.720
of a powerful man.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.320
I do not want her
to meet the fate

23:57.440 --> 23:59.480
he has planned for her.

23:59.520 --> 24:02.280
Then protect her,

24:02.400 --> 24:04.000
I beg you.

24:07.720 --> 24:11.560
While she was mine
she was safe.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.520
But you poisoned her against me

24:13.640 --> 24:17.280
and now she is alone
and vulnerable.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.880
I only ever told her the truth.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.200
Well, then you must tell her
a different truth.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.760
That our feud dies with you.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.920
That she should return to me.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.440
She won't.

24:29.480 --> 24:32.160
I thought my hatred burnt hot,

24:32.240 --> 24:34.720
but next to hers mine is tepid.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.800
Then I cannot save her.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.560
Your interest in her,

24:40.680 --> 24:43.800
it almost looks like affection.

24:43.920 --> 24:46.920
But it is twisted and rotten.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.080
She said
I was more of a mother to her

24:49.200 --> 24:52.240
than you ever were.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.440
She fed you lies

24:54.480 --> 24:56.240
and you ate them up
like sugar lumps.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.640
Nobody feigns love that well.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.920
Taken in by a harlot!

25:05.000 --> 25:07.240
Thank you...

25:07.280 --> 25:11.320
thank you for ensuring that
my last laugh was a hearty one.

25:11.440 --> 25:14.720
She loved me...

25:14.800 --> 25:16.480
and you destroyed it.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.960
No one could ever love you,
Lydia.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.200
Soon I'll be dead,

25:24.240 --> 25:26.720
and you will still be
more putrid than I.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.440
Lady Isabella,
this is unexpected.

25:55.480 --> 25:58.400
We have come to plead
on behalf of Margaret Wells.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.320
She defended her daughter
from defilement

26:00.440 --> 26:02.240
by killing Sir George Howard.

26:02.280 --> 26:03.880
Even if it's true,

26:03.960 --> 26:06.240
a murder committed
in defense of another

26:06.320 --> 26:07.440
is still a murder.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.200
But perhaps one
that could be pardoned.

26:10.680 --> 26:13.440
Lady Isabella,
surely you don't lend your name

26:13.480 --> 26:16.480
to such an absurd plea?

26:16.520 --> 26:20.160
I find men
who visit brothels absurd.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.440
I beg your pardon?

26:21.480 --> 26:24.080
How absurd it is
to pay for affection,

26:24.200 --> 26:26.680
then enjoy it
as if it were real.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.920
This perfidious harlot

26:30.000 --> 26:32.320
has entangled you in her plot.

26:32.440 --> 26:33.920
Confirm it is so,

26:34.000 --> 26:35.720
I will show her the jail.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.560
Come, Miss Wells.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.160
We will attend our appointment

26:39.240 --> 26:40.520
with the Grub Street hack.

26:40.640 --> 26:44.240
Your brother would be horrified
by your behavior.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.720
What smut he will make

26:45.760 --> 26:48.640
of the Lord Chief Justice
and Mrs. Quigley!

26:55.200 --> 26:57.560
Are you taking me
to my mother's house?

26:57.680 --> 26:59.720
I'm taking you to your mother.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.000
She's only ever
written me one letter.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.240
In it, she said that
we could never meet.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.960
Well, now she's
changed her mind.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.640
Why? I don't know.

27:09.720 --> 27:13.240
A mother's love is
a complicated puzzle.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.080
He said he'd pardon me?

27:24.200 --> 27:26.960
He said he'd try to.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.200
A man will go to great lengths
to cup his private parts

27:29.240 --> 27:31.240
if he doesn't want them viewed.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.720
I'll be here to keep you safe.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.480
Charlotte Wells
tried to kill me,

27:42.560 --> 27:45.480
I demand she know justice.

27:49.280 --> 27:52.960
Don't you dare
make demands of me!

27:53.000 --> 27:54.520
Our seedy dalliance

27:54.640 --> 27:57.240
and your inability
to be discreet about it

27:57.280 --> 28:00.560
have left me exposed.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.400
I have not told a soul.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.000
Then why am I being blackmailed

28:05.040 --> 28:07.000
by Lady Isabella Fitzwilliam

28:07.040 --> 28:08.800
and her whoreinwaiting?

28:08.920 --> 28:11.160
What do they want?

28:11.240 --> 28:13.240
A pardon for the Wells mother.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.000
I'm going to have to grant it.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.800
That is the very opposite
of what you must do.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.760
I'm not left with much choice.

28:19.880 --> 28:20.976
They're going
to have me lampooned

28:21.000 --> 28:22.440
in the scandal rags.

28:22.480 --> 28:23.560
The Marquess of Blayne

28:23.680 --> 28:26.200
is having Lady Isabella
put in Bedlam.

28:26.240 --> 28:29.000
She will be in manacles
imminently.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.720
Even if they do print her lies

28:30.760 --> 28:32.880
they will not be believed.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.480
Charlotte Wells could still

28:34.560 --> 28:36.760
make me a punchline.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.240
Then make sure
people also hear about

28:39.280 --> 28:40.800
the ruthless efficiency

28:40.920 --> 28:44.760
with which
you executed her mother.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.680
The next hanging
isn't for two days.

28:49.760 --> 28:53.240
You are the Lord Chief Justice.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.160
Every day is a hanging day

28:55.240 --> 28:56.760
if you declare it.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.240
Lord Chief Justice.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.760
You will go to the jail
immediately

29:21.880 --> 29:23.720
and hang Margaret Wells.

29:25.520 --> 29:26.840
Will it not take place
at Tyburn?

29:26.880 --> 29:29.480
I need it done today
and I haven't yet replaced you.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.680
Sir, can there be no clemency

29:31.720 --> 29:34.000
for a woman who killed
to protect her child?

29:34.040 --> 29:36.080
Madam,
do not interject yourself

29:36.200 --> 29:38.720
into matters
that don't concern you.

29:38.760 --> 29:40.720
I will not hang Mrs. Wells

29:40.800 --> 29:42.440
while my "betters" are left free

29:42.480 --> 29:43.960
to slay with impunity.

29:47.080 --> 29:50.160
I believe you have some regard
for the woman.

29:52.000 --> 29:52.960
I do.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.360
lf you want
her hanged in a manner

29:54.440 --> 29:56.480
commensurate with that regard

29:56.520 --> 29:59.560
I urge you to complete the task.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.720
If I am forced
to instruct another,

30:01.760 --> 30:04.040
I'll have her unclothed carcass

30:04.160 --> 30:06.280
paraded through the streets.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.720
A bad deed done with compassion

30:10.800 --> 30:13.160
is still a merciful act.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.520
What manner of house is this?

30:29.960 --> 30:32.160
Welcome to Mrs. Wells' emporium

30:32.240 --> 30:34.240
of womanly wonderment!

30:34.280 --> 30:36.240
I've read about places
like this.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.520
I insist you take me
to my mother.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.000
I'm here, Sophia.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.280
lt will happen today.

31:09.400 --> 31:12.200
The pardon?

31:12.240 --> 31:14.000
The execution.

31:17.520 --> 31:19.800
The Lord Chief Justice said
he would spare her.

31:21.320 --> 31:22.480
He was unequivocal.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.000
I will go back to him.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.920
lt will not help.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.640
When will it happen?

31:31.720 --> 31:34.040
II will give you some time
to make your peace.

31:35.400 --> 31:36.760
I'm truly sorry, Mrs. Wells.

31:36.880 --> 31:39.640
Shove it up your hole!

31:39.720 --> 31:42.240
lt pains me ggreatly

31:42.280 --> 31:44.160
that your sacrifice
has been in vain.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.400
lt has not been in vain.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.280
I go to my end
knowing that Lucy is safe.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.960
Tell me she is safe.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.480
We do not know where she is.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.520
She is with Lord Fallon.

32:09.640 --> 32:10.880
ln his jail cell?

32:11.960 --> 32:14.040
We were forced to set him free.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.720
Your daughter provided an alibi.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.400
No!

32:23.480 --> 32:24.520
No, no!

32:27.040 --> 32:29.720
No, no!

32:29.800 --> 32:31.760
No!

32:31.880 --> 32:33.240
No!

32:33.280 --> 32:35.080
Charlotte, no!

32:35.200 --> 32:36.320
No!

32:36.440 --> 32:37.640
No!

32:38.880 --> 32:39.880
No!

32:54.760 --> 32:55.760
Oi!

32:55.800 --> 32:57.400
Wrong entrance, Mister!

33:02.880 --> 33:05.240
Don't tell me you miss
tuppenny stand ups?

33:08.040 --> 33:11.080
I'm not pregnant, Harriet.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.720
My belly's as empty
as a leper's coin cup.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.960
The predicaments
you find yourself in!

33:16.000 --> 33:18.080
lf witch Quigley
finds out I've lied...

33:18.200 --> 33:19.416
I'm not sure
this is the best way

33:19.440 --> 33:20.760
of making the lie true.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.880
I can't rely on Charles alone.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.960
His seed might be
as dopey as he is.

33:41.760 --> 33:45.560
This is a house of ill morals.

33:45.680 --> 33:48.240
The house I live in
is respectable

33:48.280 --> 33:50.240
and dangerous.

33:50.280 --> 33:53.160
I will not subject you to it.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.920
You speak of great danger

33:56.000 --> 33:58.480
but you will not define it.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.960
Your uncle is
a monstrous incubus.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.760
It is him I protect you from.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.880
I will keep Lucy safe.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.000
And yourself.

34:38.080 --> 34:40.639
I wish I could've been better.

34:44.480 --> 34:47.000
I love you, Ma.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.520
Goodbye,

35:24.600 --> 35:26.840
little Maggie mudpie...

35:31.040 --> 35:32.360
the dirtiest urchin

35:32.440 --> 35:35.480
that ever turned up
at Quigley's door.

35:39.680 --> 35:43.440
Farewell, Nancy Faceache,

35:43.480 --> 35:47.200
the only little girl
the culls were scared of.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.200
Take me to Lord Fallon.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.680
I'm here for my sister.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.960
She's overindulged.

36:38.480 --> 36:40.480
Come back and get her tomorrow.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.640
She's no prisoner here.

36:42.760 --> 36:43.840
What have you given her?

36:47.480 --> 36:50.320
I propose that we play a game.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.960
I don't care for your games.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.560
That's because we haven't
played the best one yet.

36:54.640 --> 36:57.600
It will leave you breathless,
I promise.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.640
You have outstayed your welcome.

37:04.760 --> 37:08.120
We will play very soon,
Miss Wells.

37:08.200 --> 37:12.640
You have no idea what it means
to be outside my protection.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.640
lt means I'm free of you,

37:14.760 --> 37:16.160
you septic cunt!

37:18.160 --> 37:21.000
The Lord Justice was going
to spare your mother,

37:21.080 --> 37:22.960
but I implored him not to.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Practically signed
the warrant myself.

37:37.840 --> 37:40.760
Can't lose sight
of the girls, Will.

37:40.840 --> 37:43.080
Of course not.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.000
They became mine

37:45.080 --> 37:47.640
the same moment you did.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.640
There.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.360
It's for Jacob.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.360
For Lucy.

38:07.440 --> 38:08.680
Nothing for Charlotte?

38:10.800 --> 38:12.000
Charlotte is my heir.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.480
I'm sorry, it's time.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.920
Live your life.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.600
I'll do as you ask.

39:04.680 --> 39:07.320
I'll make a complaint
against Charlotte Wells.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.280
lt no longer matters.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.480
You'll let me go?

39:11.560 --> 39:12.640
No.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.280
Once you have taken this path

39:18.360 --> 39:20.280
it cannot be untaken.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.160
Tell him to do it.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.960
He won't do it
unless you tell him.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.880
Tell him to do it, damn you.

41:39.520 --> 41:40.600
Please.

42:02.880 --> 42:05.000
Get her down, man!

42:05.080 --> 42:06.520
Get her down!

43:19.160 --> 43:20.560
Where are you taking me?

43:20.640 --> 43:22.680
You'll meet the ship
at Tilbury.

43:22.800 --> 43:25.000
Tomorrow you set sail
for America.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.280
The law says you must hang me.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.040
The law is ink
placed on parchment

43:29.120 --> 43:31.200
by selfserving rich men.

43:31.320 --> 43:33.120
Well, then break it
and let me go.

43:33.200 --> 43:34.880
The transportation
fits your crime,

43:34.960 --> 43:36.480
but it also leaves hope.

43:36.520 --> 43:37.840
When your sentence is served

43:37.920 --> 43:40.400
you'll be free
to start a new life. Go.

43:40.480 --> 43:41.960
No, no.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.280
No, there is no hope for me
without my family.

43:46.360 --> 43:48.680
There's no life!

43:48.800 --> 43:50.680
No!

43:50.800 --> 43:52.920
No!

43:53.000 --> 43:54.200
No!

43:57.560 --> 43:59.800
Was it Quigley's doing?

44:01.480 --> 44:04.440
Then I'm as good as dead too.

44:04.480 --> 44:07.360
She thinks I've got
Charles's babe inside me.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.480
But it's a lie.

44:09.520 --> 44:12.040
One that might keep you safe.

44:12.120 --> 44:14.160
She wants me to live with her

44:14.280 --> 44:16.360
in Golden Square.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Abigail.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.440
There's a girl at Quigley's.

44:27.480 --> 44:28.640
You turn her loose,

44:28.760 --> 44:30.016
she'll tell her tale to the law.

44:30.040 --> 44:32.080
Lydia will hang
and we'll be free of her.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.400
You promised me this before

44:33.480 --> 44:34.640
and she always slithers free.

44:34.680 --> 44:37.120
This time we have her tight.

44:37.200 --> 44:38.600
She'll not shed another skin.

44:38.680 --> 44:40.760
Nobody listens
to our tales, Nancy.

44:40.840 --> 44:41.840
Haven't you noticed?

44:41.920 --> 44:43.760
When your belly doesn't grow,

44:43.840 --> 44:46.640
Lydia's suspicions will.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.320
You have no choice.

44:51.840 --> 44:54.280
Emily and I will be
leaving this evening.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.680
I'm sure you'll agree that
our offer is attractive.

44:56.800 --> 44:59.440
The thought of you not
being here is attractive.

44:59.480 --> 45:03.320
Are you sure
that's what you want?

45:03.400 --> 45:05.080
I'll do what's best
for the baby.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.360
Can I come with you?

45:06.440 --> 45:10.040
You'll need a companion, Emily.

45:11.880 --> 45:12.960
Fine.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.440
But she's not sleeping
in our room.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.480
I'm not a pet!

45:18.440 --> 45:20.000
From now on we rule ourselves.

45:20.080 --> 45:21.880
Don't get comfortable.

45:21.960 --> 45:23.160
Emily won't be away long.

45:23.280 --> 45:24.600
She won't be back

45:24.680 --> 45:27.000
now that she's got her feet
under that fine table.

45:27.080 --> 45:28.600
That poor girl's
got bigger problems

45:28.680 --> 45:29.680
than chasing luxury.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.400
She should try
walking in my shoes.

45:31.480 --> 45:33.560
Or you in hers.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.120
She isn't pregnant.

45:45.560 --> 45:47.960
Amelia!

45:48.000 --> 45:49.560
Child, can you hear me?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.040
Mother.

45:59.600 --> 46:01.320
Hello, my precious girl.
