hooking up.

I think she did, too.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.784
Yeah.
I like fixing bikes.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.952
But it's my job because
someone gives me cash to do it.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.662
‐ But we really hit it off.
‐ [Fred crying]

09:39.746 --> 09:43.458
It wasn't like a gross
sex worker situation at all.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.876
Who's a sex worker?

09:44.959 --> 09:46.169
‐ Debbie.
‐ [Debbie] No.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.462
This is a misunderstanding

09:47.545 --> 09:48.963

Okay.

‐ Yeah?

Could you wake up Franny
in 20 minutes

09:54.219 --> 09:55.136

09:55.220 --> 09:56.805

daycare, get to work by noon.

‐ Cool. I owe you.
‐ [Lip] Wait, wait, wait, Debs.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.018
How much do you owe her?

10:02.102 --> 10:02.727
Because you have to be clear
about terms up front.

Plus, he's
a psychopath, so...

10:34.968 --> 10:36.177
Yeah, but you‐you really think

10:36.261 --> 10:37.804
Mickey would kill
a parole officer?

10:37.887 --> 10:39.264
We just had
this whole conversation

10:39.347 --> 10:40.932

he basically did it,

10:41.015 --> 10:42.559

of not saying he did it

10:42.642 --> 10:44.519

he did it.

Always lie.

The point is, V,

11:03.788 --> 11:05.206

you got to spend it.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.542
‐ Five‐dollar scratchers.
‐ No, Kev.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.377
But we have $800.

a little bit odd is,

54:18.964 --> 54:21.592
Mickey, come on, hold up.

54:21.675 --> 54:24.136
Leave me alone, Gallagher.

54:24.219 --> 54:25.471
[Ian] It's just
that I hadn't really thought

54:25.554 --> 54:26.472
this marriage shit through.

54:26.555 --> 54:28.724
I don't know, I didn't think
we were gonna be

54:28.807 --> 54:29.600
having this fucking
conversation today.

54:29.683 --> 54:32.519
Then why the fuck
did you bring it up?

54:32.603 --> 54:34.313
The whole thing was
your fucking idea!

54:34.396 --> 54:34.646
‐ You talked me into this shit!
‐ I know!

54:34.730 --> 54:36.148
I know!

54:36.231 --> 54:38.901
Frank and Monica aren't exactly

54:38.984 --> 54:40.611
the fucking picture
of marital bliss, okay?

54:40.694 --> 54:42.154
I don't really have
a frame of reference

54:42.237 --> 54:43.530
to connect this shit to.

54:43.614 --> 54:45.240
‐ Oh, poor fucking you.
‐ It's not personal.

54:45.324 --> 54:45.991
‐ It's fine, it's fine.
‐ It's not personal.

54:46.074 --> 54:48.202
Mickey, I love you!

54:50.954 --> 54:53.123
It's‐‐it's marriage that I
don't know if I love, you know?

54:53.207 --> 54:56.168
Maybe, I‐I‐‐
I don't know.

54:56.251 --> 54:57.628
But you're right, it is‐‐it is
really fucking important,

54:57.711 --> 55:01.840
so can we just talk about it
for one second, please?

55:01.924 --> 55:03.675
I‐‐

55:03.759 --> 55:04.676
I want to know
how you feel, you know?

Okay, so Aunt Oopie...

55:55.602 --> 55:58.105
she can't be
Fred's guardian, Tami.

She's weird and sad.

56:20.711 --> 56:23.839
Doesn't mean that Aunt Oopie
can't babysit, right?

56:25.841 --> 56:28.176
It's not like Fred understands
what she's saying.

happens to us?

56:36.560 --> 56:40.772
We don't have anyone
to be Fred's guardian.

56:42.316 --> 56:44.693
