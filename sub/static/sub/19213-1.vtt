00:43.540 --> 00:45.500
Kohza!

00:45.500 --> 00:47.790
Toto-ojisan!

00:46.480 --> 00:47.780
Vivi!

00:48.770 --> 00:51.030
Oi!

00:54.540 --> 00:55.440
Pell!

01:07.300 --> 01:08.530
Hey, Pell.

01:08.530 --> 01:09.350
Yes?

01:09.350 --> 01:12.550
Why do you practice fencing everyday?

01:12.550 --> 01:14.200
Because I'm a guardian.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.850
In order to protect this country,

01:16.850 --> 01:18.220
I need to become stronger.

01:18.220 --> 01:20.220
Who are you going to fight?

01:20.220 --> 01:21.180
Well...

01:21.180 --> 01:23.800
It's more about protecting than fighting.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.180
Is it different?

01:25.180 --> 01:26.680
The intention is different.

01:27.750 --> 01:28.810
That's strange.

01:31.310 --> 01:32.250
Papa.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.090
Soon I will reach the country.

01:34.090 --> 01:35.660
Don't be deceived.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.520
That man is not the country's hero.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.240
He's trying to steal Arabasta.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.410
Please don't do anything rash!

01:53.030 --> 01:53.700
What?

01:53.700 --> 01:54.540
What is it?

02:03.660 --> 02:04.950
Okama (gay) way

02:05.700 --> 02:08.150
We caught an Okama!

02:08.150 --> 02:09.350
What're you doing to Carue?!

02:10.070 --> 02:11.440
There's no bait left...

02:11.440 --> 02:13.560
You just ate a while ago, didn't you?!!

02:13.560 --> 02:15.050
But...

02:17.420 --> 02:18.940
Really, swan, swan...

02:19.490 --> 02:22.960
To think, I was rescued by a pirate crew that I don't even know.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.230
This favor, I shall never forget it.

02:25.230 --> 02:26.850
We didn't catch you on purpose.

02:26.850 --> 02:28.130
What're you doing in a place like this?

02:28.130 --> 02:29.770
It's a long story.

02:29.770 --> 02:30.630
Then, never mind.

02:30.630 --> 02:30.920
Huh?

02:31.400 --> 02:33.130
You're so cute!

02:33.390 --> 02:35.170
I really like you.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.130
Weird man.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.530
Even so, at the moment I fell into the sea,

02:39.530 --> 02:41.450
I thought I was done for.

02:41.450 --> 02:42.740
You can't swim?

02:42.740 --> 02:45.400
That's right, I'm a hammer.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.290
Are you a Devil's Fruit user?

02:47.290 --> 02:48.100
That's correct.

02:48.510 --> 02:50.270
I'm a rarity in this world.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.950
I ate the Devil's Fruit!

02:54.950 --> 02:56.930
What's that, not very surprised...

02:56.930 --> 02:58.430
You're nothing unusual.

02:58.690 --> 03:00.590
You're so full of yourself.

03:00.610 --> 03:04.560
Bastard! What you want is to provoke Nami-san, right?!

03:00.590 --> 03:02.580
There are abilities which you might not know.

03:02.580 --> 03:06.080
Since I've already seen so many, there's nothing that can surprise me now.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.140
Fine, then.

03:07.140 --> 03:09.200
I'll show you my amusing way of thanking.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.160
Alright! Alright! Show… us…

03:12.850 --> 03:13.080
Oi!

03:18.880 --> 03:19.800
What're you...

03:21.480 --> 03:22.620
No way.

03:23.090 --> 03:24.840
Hey you! What're you doing?!

03:25.250 --> 03:27.480
Wait.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.390
I told you it was amusing.

03:31.380 --> 03:33.350
It's no joke.

03:33.610 --> 03:34.430
It's me!

03:34.430 --> 03:35.360
Do I look like you?

03:35.360 --> 03:36.270
Surprised?

03:37.920 --> 03:41.400
This is the ability of the mane mane fruit I ate.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.400
mane: mimicry

03:41.400 --> 03:42.320
Amazing!

03:42.700 --> 03:44.780
But if I touch myself with my left hand…

03:45.090 --> 03:46.700
Look! I'm back to normal.

03:47.190 --> 03:47.900
The voice too...

03:47.900 --> 03:49.050
Even the complexion...

03:49.050 --> 03:49.970
To be honest.

03:50.920 --> 03:51.710
The truth is...

03:52.220 --> 03:55.580
It isn't really necessary to hit...

03:57.410 --> 03:58.320
Don't touch me.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.040
Well, it's okay.

03:59.270 --> 04:00.170
But if I...

04:00.590 --> 04:02.220
With my right hand...

04:02.620 --> 04:04.880
Touch the face of my partner...

04:06.870 --> 04:08.800
Like this, I can...

04:09.960 --> 04:12.250
Imitate anyone.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.370
My body too.

04:17.110 --> 04:18.240
Stop it!

04:18.240 --> 04:19.110
Ouch!

04:19.510 --> 04:20.410
You're amazing!

04:20.410 --> 04:21.320
Amazing!

04:21.910 --> 04:26.280
Furthermore, I can use my memory ability.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.670
The faces...

04:27.970 --> 04:28.630
I touched...

04:28.900 --> 04:29.730
Before...

04:30.090 --> 04:30.790
I definitely...

04:31.140 --> 04:31.860
Won't...

04:32.180 --> 04:32.750
Forget.

04:36.030 --> 04:36.910
How is it?

04:36.910 --> 04:38.580
My hidden talent.

04:38.580 --> 04:40.100
So cool!

04:40.100 --> 04:42.000
It's no joke!

04:42.000 --> 04:43.400
Do whatever you want...

04:46.090 --> 04:48.230
Hey, isn't that your ship?

04:48.230 --> 04:50.300
Oh? Time to part already?

04:51.900 --> 04:53.480
Don't be sad!

04:53.480 --> 04:54.770
Farewells are natural things.

04:55.570 --> 04:57.400
But, just don't forget this...

04:57.590 --> 04:59.120
In friendship...

05:00.120 --> 05:02.860
The time we've known each other doesn't matter!

05:02.960 --> 05:05.570
Let's meet again!

05:05.960 --> 05:08.620
Well, let's go guys!

05:08.620 --> 05:10.280
Yes! Bon Kurei-sama!

05:08.620 --> 05:10.280
Bon: Festival of the Dead; Kure: Year End

05:10.980 --> 05:11.740
Eh?!

05:12.000 --> 05:13.080
Bon Kurei?

05:13.530 --> 05:13.950
Vivi?

05:14.580 --> 05:16.160
Crocodile's subordinate!

05:16.640 --> 05:18.460
Didn't you recognize his face?

05:18.740 --> 05:20.920
I've never met him until now.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.680
When he looked back into his memory,

05:23.680 --> 05:24.880
My father's face was there.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.160
Why my father's face...

05:29.160 --> 05:31.920
For example, if you disguise yourself as a king…

05:32.780 --> 05:34.890
You can do some bad things…

05:37.230 --> 05:38.810
Dance powder… that guy…

05:39.310 --> 05:40.570
What is that?

05:40.570 --> 05:43.910
A powder that can make artificial rainfall.

05:43.910 --> 05:47.260
The World Government prohibited its production.

05:47.260 --> 05:49.140
That's a useful powder…

05:49.140 --> 05:50.140
Why not use it?

05:50.140 --> 05:51.280
Dance powder, right?

05:52.160 --> 05:54.680
It makes clouds that aren't ready for rainfall…

05:54.680 --> 05:58.940
Artificially grow into maturity in order to make it rain.

05:58.940 --> 06:02.600
It steals the rain from neighboring countries.

06:02.600 --> 06:06.800
And because of the frequent disputes between them…

06:06.800 --> 06:09.720
The World Government had to prohibit it, huh?

06:10.390 --> 06:11.530
2 years ago,

06:11.530 --> 06:17.310
A large quantity of dance powder arrived to the port city of Arabasta, Nanohana.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.660
At that time, except for Alubarna where the king lives,

06:20.660 --> 06:23.590
Abnormal incidents of rain not falling occurred.

06:23.590 --> 06:26.030
So they got suspicious of the king.

06:26.020 --> 06:29.700
As if he used that powder to posses the rain.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.540
Vivi!

06:30.530 --> 06:32.730
Then, your father is a bad guy!

06:32.730 --> 06:34.740
Idiot! He was framed!

06:34.770 --> 06:37.600
Vivi's father wouldn't do such a thing.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.180
He wouldn't.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.020
He wouldn't.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.990
It's as Sanji-san says.

06:40.990 --> 06:43.710
My father isn't an egoistical person, so something must have happened.

06:44.730 --> 06:49.140
At the port, the appearance of the person receiving the cargo was witnessed,

06:49.140 --> 06:50.550
And judging by the hat he was wearing...

06:50.550 --> 06:54.420
The identity of the man who was transporting the dance powder to the palace is now very clear.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.260
I see, that guy was disguised as the king.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.100
We let such a troublesome guy get away.

07:00.590 --> 07:04.190
Everything was the plan of Crocodile, his organization's boss.

07:04.670 --> 07:07.190
As he expected, it caused rebellion.

07:07.190 --> 07:08.400
I see.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.170
Make the royal army and the rebel army clash,

07:12.170 --> 07:15.570
So when both are weakened, he'll steal the throne.

07:15.570 --> 07:17.330
He disguises himself as the country's hero.

07:18.060 --> 07:20.440
He stole the royal family's trust, the rain,

07:20.440 --> 07:23.330
Even people's lives, and created disorder in Arabasta!

07:23.780 --> 07:25.130
That's Crocodile!

07:31.300 --> 07:33.050
Amazing!

07:39.750 --> 07:42.000
Crocodile! Crocodile!

07:42.000 --> 07:44.850
Sir Crocodile!

07:44.850 --> 07:47.620
The Protector God of Arabasta!

07:47.620 --> 07:49.680
The King of the Desert!

07:49.680 --> 07:52.280
Crocodile! Crocodile!

07:53.880 --> 07:55.410
Shut up, you ignorant fools!

07:55.960 --> 07:59.510
Even if you say that, you always come and rescue us.

07:59.510 --> 07:59.870
He's fantastic!

08:01.680 --> 08:04.280
Well, call it whatever you want.

08:06.760 --> 08:10.110
Your Majesty, Crocodile-sama has arrived.

08:15.310 --> 08:17.930
It's a present, Mr. Cobra.

08:19.470 --> 08:20.640
We always receive your help.

08:22.670 --> 08:23.540
It's fine.

08:23.540 --> 08:27.540
The royal army takes care of the rebel army. I take care of pirates.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.980
Well, I'll leave the disposal of this trash to you.

08:31.760 --> 08:32.690
By the way,

08:33.460 --> 08:37.250
I heard the rebel army was making a disturbance.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.450
What do you plan to do?

08:39.140 --> 08:41.210
The country is the people.

08:41.210 --> 08:43.909
If they intend to come and attack us, there's nothing to do.

08:44.620 --> 08:45.850
I see.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.480
We'll meet again before long.

08:52.470 --> 08:55.630
Anyway, this time there will be too many enigmas.

08:55.630 --> 08:56.260
I see.

08:56.790 --> 08:59.720
If we use this, there's no reason to distrust our nakama.

09:00.030 --> 09:02.070
Using a double mark, huh?

09:02.070 --> 09:04.410
It's a very clever strategy.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.110
Could it be that you're the okama bastard?

09:06.450 --> 09:07.790
I'll slice you up! Bastard!

09:07.790 --> 09:08.720
Oh, it's Zoro.

09:08.720 --> 09:09.770
So it's Zoro...

09:10.680 --> 09:11.230
Yosh!

09:11.640 --> 09:13.670
From now on, if anything happens,

09:13.670 --> 09:15.540
Show this on your left arm!

09:15.540 --> 09:16.070
Yeah!

09:23.700 --> 09:26.260
It's the mark of nakama!

09:28.680 --> 09:30.120
Let's land!

09:30.380 --> 09:32.120
At Arabasta!

09:32.120 --> 09:33.830
Yeah!

09:35.410 --> 09:36.050
Papa.

09:37.370 --> 09:41.000
I'll definitely stop the rebel army.

09:53.220 --> 09:59.980
Episode of Arabasta

09:53.220 --> 09:59.980
The Desert Princess and the Pirates.

10:00.550 --> 10:02.630
I'm thirsty...

10:02.630 --> 10:04.220
You sure are evil...

10:04.220 --> 10:07.620
Stealing our precious water and food.

10:07.620 --> 10:11.270
Soon we'll arrive at the rebel army headquarters in Yuba.

10:11.270 --> 10:13.630
But, will we really be okay?

10:14.110 --> 10:16.430
A lot of blood is going to my head...

10:16.430 --> 10:17.040
It's alright.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.380
We'll surely manage to persuade them.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.650
This is horrible.

10:26.110 --> 10:27.050
Where's the water?

10:27.050 --> 10:28.180
Hey, water.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.810
Where are you water?

10:29.810 --> 10:30.260
Water...

10:25.650 --> 10:27.440
It's covered with sand...

10:27.440 --> 10:29.810
Wasn't there an oasis here?

10:30.700 --> 10:32.770
The sand has covered the earth...

10:35.870 --> 10:36.720
Someone's there.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.020
Eh? Really?

10:40.210 --> 10:41.930
Travelers, right?

10:41.930 --> 10:44.500
A journey in the desert is tiring, isn't it?

10:44.500 --> 10:48.360
Sorry, this town is all dried up.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.330
Um...

10:50.330 --> 10:53.180
We heard the rebel army was in this town so...

10:53.840 --> 10:54.680
You!

10:55.310 --> 10:58.790
Could it be that you people want to join the rebel army!

10:59.740 --> 11:02.400
They're no longer in this town.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.040
No way!

11:04.040 --> 11:05.500
What's going on, Vivi?

11:06.920 --> 11:08.970
You just said Vivi...

11:07.220 --> 11:08.970
Umm...I...

11:08.970 --> 11:10.080
Oi, Ossan!

11:10.080 --> 11:11.640
Vivi is not the princess!

11:12.010 --> 11:12.910
Don't say it!

11:12.910 --> 11:14.250
Is that you Vivi-chan?

11:14.250 --> 11:15.740
Am I right?

11:15.740 --> 11:17.900
You're alive, I'm glad!

11:17.900 --> 11:18.750
It's me.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.120
Don't you recognize me?

11:20.120 --> 11:21.370
Toto-ojisan?

11:21.370 --> 11:22.030
That's right!

11:22.630 --> 11:23.750
No way!

11:23.750 --> 11:25.900
You've become… so thin…

11:25.900 --> 11:29.420
What? It's no big deal.

11:29.420 --> 11:34.200
I still believe in Vivi-chan and His Majesty.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.920
That man is definitely not the type that will betray the country.

11:38.520 --> 11:39.770
Am I right?

11:39.770 --> 11:41.320
I'm counting on you, Toto.

11:41.320 --> 11:44.880
I'll make sure Yuba becomes a prosperous town with abundant greenery.

11:45.630 --> 11:47.100
We'll build an amazing town,

11:47.100 --> 11:49.350
And make this country much more prosperous.

11:50.170 --> 11:51.360
See you, Vivi.

11:51.360 --> 11:56.340
Don't forget the pride of the Suna Suna Clan you got as sub-leader, and become a fine princess!

11:51.360 --> 11:56.340
Suna: Sand

11:56.340 --> 11:57.730
Yes, Leader.

11:57.730 --> 11:58.730
It's a promise!

11:59.580 --> 12:01.710
See ya!

12:01.710 --> 12:03.240
Rebellion is such a foolish thing.

12:04.150 --> 12:07.730
I tried to stop him many times, and yet...

12:07.730 --> 12:11.250
When they heard a rumor that the royal army was being used to invade...

12:11.250 --> 12:13.530
They went towards Nanohana.

12:13.530 --> 12:14.910
The royal army is in Nanohana?

12:15.470 --> 12:16.660
Toto-ojisan, when was that?

12:17.730 --> 12:19.170
About 5 hours ago.

12:29.690 --> 12:31.000
We're too late.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.640
What a terrible situation.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.180
But, where'd the royal army go?

12:35.950 --> 12:38.300
We came here hoping we might encounter them...

12:39.320 --> 12:41.370
This isn't the time to talk.

12:41.370 --> 12:43.020
Let's help everyone in town.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.000
Stay calm.

12:45.000 --> 12:45.860
Don't push the ones in front.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.430
To the west side of town!

12:47.430 --> 12:48.570
Run into the wind!

12:49.150 --> 12:50.340
Hang in there.

12:50.340 --> 12:51.610
There's still more to save.

12:51.610 --> 12:51.950
Be strong.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.790
The king... ordered to... burn the town...

12:55.790 --> 12:56.910
Don't talk!

12:57.550 --> 12:59.880
Oi! Kid, are you alright?

13:00.250 --> 13:02.140
Damn! Even the kids!

13:02.140 --> 13:03.110
Damn Cobra!

13:03.110 --> 13:04.760
His degradation has gone this far.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.720
At this rate, only death awaits Arabasta!

13:07.720 --> 13:08.700
Kohza!

13:09.360 --> 13:11.610
Contact everyone...

13:11.610 --> 13:13.290
Kohza, then...

13:13.290 --> 13:14.420
Yeah.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.060
We'll finish this country.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.970
The current Arabasta is already dead!

13:18.970 --> 13:20.610
This is the last battle!

13:20.610 --> 13:22.270
We'll invade Alubarna!

13:35.310 --> 13:37.620
Operation Utopia.

13:37.620 --> 13:39.880
The first step was completed nicely but,

13:39.880 --> 13:44.870
The arrival of Princess Vivi and the Strawhats to this place was not part of the calculations.

13:44.870 --> 13:47.760
But, that's not a big problem.

13:48.420 --> 13:55.010
Now, we have to prevent the princess and the young leader of the rebel army, Kohza, from making contact.

13:55.010 --> 13:57.180
Then, we'll move on to the second step.

13:58.230 --> 13:59.140
Good luck.

14:02.430 --> 14:04.060
It's almost time.

14:04.060 --> 14:07.390
By tomorrow, the Kingdom of Arabasta will be mine.

14:07.390 --> 14:10.280
We'll change it into our Utopia.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.980
The world's most terrifying ancient weapon...

14:13.450 --> 14:16.950
Once I have Pluton in my hands, this will become a great military country.

14:17.550 --> 14:19.770
Kohza and the others are already at their limits...

14:19.770 --> 14:22.870
They're even ready to die.

14:23.140 --> 14:27.130
I beg you Vivi-chan, please stop those fools.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.590
Toto-ojisan, don't worry.

14:30.590 --> 14:31.090
Vivi-chan.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.680
We'll definitely stop the rebellion.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.350
Vivi...

14:42.390 --> 14:45.870
Well then, we are leaving, Toto-ojisan.

14:45.870 --> 14:46.490
Yes.

14:46.490 --> 14:48.200
Please, take this with you.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.240
Oh! Water!

14:49.240 --> 14:50.210
Water!

14:50.210 --> 14:53.470
Can there really be water in such a dried up place?

14:53.470 --> 14:56.810
Yes, after all, Yuba won't lose to some sand.

14:56.810 --> 14:58.780
I excavated it yesterday after one week of trying.

14:58.950 --> 15:01.950
It's genuine Yuba water.

15:01.950 --> 15:03.460
Such precious water.

15:03.460 --> 15:04.460
Thank you!

15:04.460 --> 15:05.880
I will treasure it.

15:05.880 --> 15:06.810
See ya!

15:06.810 --> 15:07.870
Dried up-ossan.

15:24.070 --> 15:25.820
What's wrong, Luffy?

15:26.810 --> 15:28.090
Luffy-san?

15:28.090 --> 15:29.030
I quit.

15:30.420 --> 15:31.980
What do you mean by "I quit"?

15:32.410 --> 15:35.570
You know, we have no time for your jokes.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.110
We're going to stop the rebel army, right?

15:37.490 --> 15:38.750
Of course.

15:38.750 --> 15:39.550
It's pointless.

15:39.550 --> 15:40.450
What was that?!

15:42.190 --> 15:42.900
Vivi.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.580
I'm gonna kick Crocodile's ass.

15:49.310 --> 15:53.200
If we stop the rebels, will Crocodile stop?

15:53.810 --> 15:54.670
Well...

15:54.670 --> 15:57.770
This guy... once in a while has a point.

15:57.770 --> 15:58.760
Even though it's Luffy.

15:59.240 --> 16:03.550
You don't want anyone to die in this battle.

16:03.550 --> 16:06.020
The country's people, us, everyone.

16:07.410 --> 16:09.180
Aren't you being too naïve?

16:10.370 --> 16:13.440
Shouldn't I think that way?

16:13.950 --> 16:17.370
What's wrong with not wanting people to die?

16:17.370 --> 16:18.610
People die.

16:22.990 --> 16:25.240
Stop talking that way!

16:25.240 --> 16:27.180
If you say it again, I won't forgive you!

16:27.180 --> 16:31.080
The royal army, the rebel army, and the people of this country haven't done anything bad.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.790
Why can't I wish for people not to die?

16:35.490 --> 16:39.000
Then, why are you risking your life?!

16:39.020 --> 16:40.210
Oi! You're over doing it!

16:39.560 --> 16:40.210
Bastard!

16:40.690 --> 16:43.980
After seeing this country, we know what's the most important thing to do...

16:43.980 --> 16:44.710
What is it?!

16:44.710 --> 16:46.060
We all know!

16:46.530 --> 16:50.430
Do you think that risking your life is enough?

16:50.430 --> 16:53.690
Then, what else shall I risk?!

16:53.690 --> 16:55.580
Is there anything else...?

16:55.580 --> 16:58.710
Is there anything else I can risk?!

16:58.710 --> 16:59.660
I don't have anything...

17:01.700 --> 17:05.240
Try risking our lives together!

17:05.800 --> 17:07.790
We're nakama!

17:15.589 --> 17:18.690
What… the tears came out.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.150
The truth is, if you're the one suffering the most.

17:22.150 --> 17:24.109
I will kick those guys' asses.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.790
Show us.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.020
Crocodile's whereabouts.

17:44.540 --> 17:47.160
The royal army burnt down Nanohana?

17:47.160 --> 17:49.160
Such order was never given.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.920
It might be a trap from the rebel army.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.950
Assemble the entire army at once.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.380
Chaka, gather the officers.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.190
Assemble a battle formation.

17:59.190 --> 18:02.080
Pell, fly and inspect the enemy formation.

18:02.080 --> 18:02.840
Is that clear?

18:02.840 --> 18:04.800
We'll attack the rebel army.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.760
Resist to the very end!

18:07.600 --> 18:08.940
What're you doing?

18:08.940 --> 18:09.890
Yes!

18:11.340 --> 18:14.590
With this, they'll be confused.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.560
Mission accomplished.

18:20.910 --> 18:22.480
Amazing, so fast!

18:22.920 --> 18:26.830
Matsuge: Eyelashes

18:22.920 --> 18:26.830
Matsuge says that, since he was born in this area, he has a lot of friends around here.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.950
T-thank you, Matsuge.

18:30.740 --> 18:31.720
Luffy-san.

18:32.170 --> 18:37.130
Thank you.  I don't know how to repay you for helping me make this important decision.

18:37.130 --> 18:37.780
Is that so?

18:37.780 --> 18:39.340
Give me food.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.880
If I beat Crocodile, give me some food to die for.

18:44.440 --> 18:45.340
Yes.

18:46.170 --> 18:47.640
Just you wait.

18:47.640 --> 18:52.860
Cro-co-di-le!

18:54.540 --> 18:55.580
What's this?

18:57.810 --> 18:58.980
Stop Chopper!

18:58.980 --> 18:59.600
Got it.

19:07.370 --> 19:08.300
Vivi!

19:09.500 --> 19:12.460
Did you call for me, Strawhat Luffy?

19:12.610 --> 19:13.460
Get away from Vivi!

19:16.130 --> 19:16.850
Alright!

19:16.850 --> 19:18.670
So you're Crocodile?!

19:20.530 --> 19:21.590
Don't shout.

19:27.980 --> 19:29.720
Vivi-sama, why're you here?

19:29.720 --> 19:30.180
Pell!

19:39.520 --> 19:40.740
Bastard!

19:41.090 --> 19:42.160
What did you do?!

19:42.160 --> 19:42.900
Seis Fleur.

19:42.160 --> 19:42.900
Seis Fleur: Six Flower

19:47.950 --> 19:48.410
Clutch.

19:50.430 --> 19:51.290
Pell!

19:52.510 --> 19:55.120
The kingdom's best warrior isn't a big deal.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.580
What are these guys?

19:58.690 --> 19:59.800
It's useless.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.030
The party has already begun.

20:03.030 --> 20:04.630
Isn't that right, Miss All Sunday?

20:05.550 --> 20:06.340
Yes.

20:08.020 --> 20:08.800
It can't be...

20:09.520 --> 20:11.260
To Alubarna!

20:13.530 --> 20:18.370
The rebel army got weapons from a merchant ship in Nanohana...

20:18.370 --> 20:19.730
And with those, they began the attack.

20:21.730 --> 20:25.660
And so, the royal army intends to start a full scale attack.

20:25.660 --> 20:27.030
We will protect Arabasta!

20:28.450 --> 20:29.990
Doesn't it make you cry?

20:30.260 --> 20:33.450
Their love for this country will be the thing that destroys it.

20:35.380 --> 20:36.920
It's not too late yet...

20:36.920 --> 20:40.450
If I manage to get to the palace at Alubarna before the rebel army...

20:40.450 --> 20:43.420
We might stop this conflict.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.170
What a guy...

20:45.170 --> 20:48.020
The word "traitor" describes this guy perfectly.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.640
Where's Luffy?

20:55.680 --> 20:56.640
Zoro!

21:03.050 --> 21:04.610
You guys go ahead.

21:04.610 --> 21:06.200
I'll take care of this!

21:06.200 --> 21:07.110
Strawhat...

21:07.480 --> 21:08.530
Hurry up and leave!

21:09.620 --> 21:10.260
Chopper.

21:10.260 --> 21:10.990
Go, hurry!

21:13.260 --> 21:14.580
Are you stupid?

21:14.580 --> 21:16.180
Like I'll let you leave without...

21:18.100 --> 21:19.580
Your opponent is over here!

21:20.680 --> 21:21.790
Brat...

21:25.250 --> 21:26.840
So they escaped after all.

21:27.270 --> 21:28.190
Luffy-san!

21:28.190 --> 21:30.850
Vivi, he'll be fine.

21:30.850 --> 21:35.350
So far, once Luffy picks his opponent, there's no one that has gotten away unharmed.

21:35.350 --> 21:36.240
Listen, Vivi.

21:36.970 --> 21:38.810
He will keep Crocodile busy.

21:39.410 --> 21:40.360
Gomu Gomu no

21:40.510 --> 21:41.110
Pistol

21:48.660 --> 21:50.190
Crocodile will be defeated by him.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.260
The instant the rebel army started to advance...

21:53.260 --> 21:55.600
This country's time limit had been decided.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.120
And if you are the only hope for stopping them...

21:58.980 --> 22:00.290
We'll keep you alive no matter what.

22:00.350 --> 22:01.750
Gatling

22:02.850 --> 22:05.210
From here on, anything that happens to anyone here...

22:05.950 --> 22:07.590
Doesn't matter.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.590
Bazooka

22:12.050 --> 22:13.560
It's like the marimo says.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.180
You won't have to think of fighting alone anymore.

22:16.180 --> 22:19.150
Vi-Vi-Vivivi... you don't have to worry...

22:19.150 --> 22:21.040
Y-you can count on me...

22:21.570 --> 22:22.430
Luffy-san.

22:25.210 --> 22:27.350
I'll be waiting in Alubarna.

22:30.910 --> 22:32.010
Damn it...

22:32.010 --> 22:33.640
I can't hit him at all.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.100
He keeps dissolving!

22:35.100 --> 22:37.820
Our pirate levels are too different, Strawhat Luffy.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.750
Play time is over.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.370
Desert Espada

22:42.080 --> 22:43.370
Espada: Sword

22:49.100 --> 22:51.090
Eh? The desert was cut?!

22:51.330 --> 22:52.880
Impressive, you saw through it.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.580
Desert Girasol

22:52.880 --> 22:54.580
Girasol: Sunflower

22:58.150 --> 22:59.720
What? What? What?

23:00.080 --> 23:02.010
Haven't you heard of quicksand?

23:02.010 --> 23:04.020
There's no need for a gravestone, it's a desert coffin.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.280
You're now being dragged into an underground waterway.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.940
There's no one in this world that can match me in a desert battle.

23:11.340 --> 23:14.100
Like I'm gonna get buried alive by some sand.

23:14.700 --> 23:15.860
Gomu Gomu no

23:15.860 --> 23:16.910
Bazooka

23:17.880 --> 23:18.990
Gomu Gomu no

23:19.160 --> 23:20.220
Stamp

23:21.650 --> 23:22.200
It's no use.

23:23.390 --> 23:24.040
Barehand.

23:27.670 --> 23:29.550
My leg turned into a mummy!

23:29.550 --> 23:33.340
It's because the sand has absorbed your moisture.

23:33.630 --> 23:36.190
You gotta be kidding.

23:36.190 --> 23:36.550
That's right!

23:41.220 --> 23:42.260
Restored!

23:42.260 --> 23:43.340
Useless.

23:43.340 --> 23:44.510
It's not useless!

23:44.810 --> 23:49.150
The dried up-ossan dug this water, it's very precious water!

23:49.150 --> 23:50.650
Ossan said so!

23:51.090 --> 23:53.150
Yuba won't lose to just some sand!

24:03.270 --> 24:05.830
Who do you think I am?

24:06.140 --> 24:09.470
There are many rookies like you…

24:11.120 --> 24:14.250
There're many of them, Strawhat Luffy...

24:14.860 --> 24:17.680
On this Grand Line.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.660
It can't be...

24:35.660 --> 24:36.610
He's still alive...

24:39.560 --> 24:40.950
It's painful, isn't it?

24:40.950 --> 24:43.000
But, you'll soon be at peace.

24:44.310 --> 24:46.030
What a waste of time.

24:50.250 --> 24:52.790
Princess Vivi is heading to Alubarna,

24:52.790 --> 24:55.540
Contact the agents.

24:55.540 --> 24:56.170
I understand.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.090
Why do you fight?

25:02.450 --> 25:04.570
You people who hold the name "D"...

25:11.310 --> 25:14.640
Vivi, how much further until we reach the palace?

25:14.640 --> 25:15.810
Maybe about 50 km.

25:16.070 --> 25:18.150
Still that much?

25:17.210 --> 25:18.850
We're not gonna make it...

25:18.150 --> 25:21.240
Can't we speed up, Hasami-kun?

25:18.150 --> 25:21.240
Hasami: Scissors

25:21.750 --> 25:22.770
That's right!

25:22.770 --> 25:24.280
Hasami really likes dancers.

25:29.220 --> 25:30.460
Is this fine?

25:34.180 --> 25:34.880
He's looking this way.

25:38.000 --> 25:38.760
We accelerated!

25:38.760 --> 25:39.770
Pervert Power!

25:39.770 --> 25:41.530
Nami-swan!

25:41.530 --> 25:44.220
Controlling two idiots with the same trick.

25:47.230 --> 25:49.140
If we keep going this fast, we might be able to do something.

25:49.490 --> 25:51.700
However, don't get too confident yet.

25:51.700 --> 25:52.350
Yeah.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.190
The king disappeared, you say?!

25:58.790 --> 26:01.700
I looked all over the palace, but he's nowhere!

26:01.700 --> 26:05.580
Besides, we've confirmed the rebel army, about 20 km to the south.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.500
Defend all the gates!

26:08.500 --> 26:10.570
Don't let them take even one step into this town.

26:10.570 --> 26:10.790
Yes!

26:22.760 --> 26:24.640
Since they're coming here from Yuba...

26:24.640 --> 26:27.510
If we stick to the west gate, there's no way we won't notice them.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.080
They plan on getting here before the rebel army.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.450
Do they think they can stop them?

26:31.450 --> 26:32.470
Geez.

26:31.450 --> 26:35.570
They.. are... coming...

26:34.810 --> 26:35.570
What?

26:35.570 --> 26:37.880
Say it faster! You slow daruma!

26:35.570 --> 26:37.880
daruma: Japanese tumbling doll

26:37.880 --> 26:39.030
My hip!

26:40.320 --> 26:41.110
A moving crab...

26:41.740 --> 26:43.770
W-with six people!

26:44.190 --> 26:47.030
Don't bother with the others, our target is only Vivi.

26:47.270 --> 26:48.410
"Only" you say?

26:48.750 --> 26:49.490
Then you...

26:50.020 --> 26:52.450
Which one is Vivi, I can't tell the difference.

26:52.660 --> 26:54.270
These guys...

26:54.270 --> 26:55.210
They're using the same mantle!

26:55.770 --> 26:57.160
This is so confusing!

26:59.710 --> 27:01.680
We'll take care of those two!

27:01.680 --> 27:03.100
Let's go Mr. 4!

27:03.100 --> 27:03.750
Y-e-s...

27:05.980 --> 27:07.570
They split again!

27:07.570 --> 27:09.920
They're planning on getting inside separately.

27:09.920 --> 27:10.680
After them.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.050
Then I...

27:12.420 --> 27:13.680
Un... Deux...

27:19.570 --> 27:21.650
You're not getting away!

27:25.940 --> 27:27.820
Thank you, everyone.

27:32.430 --> 27:34.410
Is it okay that you came all this way?

27:35.870 --> 27:37.540
You guys made the correct choice,

27:37.540 --> 27:39.260
I'm Princess Vivi.

27:39.260 --> 27:40.470
What're you saying...

27:40.470 --> 27:41.390
I told you.

27:41.390 --> 27:42.630
I'm the real Vivi!

27:44.910 --> 27:46.800
Good job on getting this far.

27:47.780 --> 27:50.260
Now, let's show them our true face!

27:50.260 --> 27:51.280
It's a shame...

27:51.280 --> 27:52.530
You fail!

27:53.610 --> 27:54.430
The Princess Vivi...

27:54.670 --> 27:56.140
Where'd she go?!

27:57.060 --> 27:57.600
I'll kill you!

28:01.740 --> 28:03.730
I'm sorry!

28:09.510 --> 28:12.160
The rebel army should be coming soon.

28:39.140 --> 28:40.570
Leader...

28:40.570 --> 28:42.100
Listen to what I have to say...

28:42.540 --> 28:43.610
Everyone!

28:43.610 --> 28:45.380
Just a little more to break through the south gate!

28:45.380 --> 28:48.040
Next, we will attack from inside the front gate.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.320
Get ready!

28:53.130 --> 28:54.230
Please stop!

28:54.230 --> 28:55.240
Rebel army!

29:01.970 --> 29:04.130
This battle was planned!

29:08.860 --> 29:09.270
What was that?

29:09.270 --> 29:10.700
With this, the visibility...

29:11.990 --> 29:13.850
What a foolish thing to do...

29:14.610 --> 29:16.100
The royal army?

29:16.700 --> 29:19.200
I haven't given the order to fire yet!

29:19.200 --> 29:21.930
I-I'm really sorry...

29:21.930 --> 29:22.520
My hand slipped...

29:23.270 --> 29:25.480
Don't act on your own!

29:25.490 --> 29:27.540
Do not falter! Advance!

29:27.540 --> 29:28.700
It's just sand dust!

29:28.920 --> 29:29.800
Stop!

29:29.800 --> 29:31.150
Everyone! Wait!

29:31.940 --> 29:33.380
We're doing this for the country!

29:33.380 --> 29:35.140
The king won't be forgiven!

29:35.140 --> 29:36.810
Leader!

29:41.260 --> 29:42.620
Was it my imagination?

29:51.640 --> 29:52.700
Leader?

29:58.520 --> 30:00.020
Chaka-sama, your orders!

30:02.610 --> 30:03.560
Open fire!

30:04.100 --> 30:04.810
Shoot!

30:05.510 --> 30:07.610
Don't let them get inside!

30:09.170 --> 30:10.330
Don't falter!

30:10.330 --> 30:12.860
Attack Alubarna!

30:15.070 --> 30:17.490
Reinforce the protection of the south gate.

30:43.230 --> 30:43.890
Carue!

30:44.450 --> 30:46.440
You covered me.

30:47.810 --> 30:49.070
I'm sorry...

30:50.520 --> 30:54.240
Even thought we got here, the rebellion started.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.860
But I'll stop them.

30:56.160 --> 30:58.490
No matter how many times I get rejected.

30:58.490 --> 31:01.820
Just like I learned on the ship, I can't give up.

31:09.720 --> 31:10.840
Usopp!

31:12.830 --> 31:14.170
Santouryuu

31:17.500 --> 31:18.230
Ushibari

31:17.500 --> 31:18.230
Ushibari: Bull Horns

31:27.860 --> 31:28.610
Stinger

31:30.660 --> 31:31.000
Step

31:38.540 --> 31:40.470
At this rate, we won't settle it.

31:40.470 --> 31:42.160
I got it now!

31:42.600 --> 31:44.660
I'm gonna get really serious now!

31:46.290 --> 31:47.540
Try it.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.740
Are you really alright?

31:56.270 --> 31:59.590
Okay, but don't push yourself.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.060
We can't search for Kohza within this fray.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.620
The fight has only started in this place...

32:17.620 --> 32:19.550
Let's go to the palace to see Chaka!

32:25.630 --> 32:26.910
Carue?!

32:34.620 --> 32:35.040
Carue!

32:40.660 --> 32:41.470
I understand.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.350
You are...

32:54.660 --> 32:55.730
Please take care of Carue!

33:00.710 --> 33:03.210
That idio-! Is he your captain?!

33:03.210 --> 33:05.180
He was killed by the Boss.

33:05.180 --> 33:07.310
He's no pirate king.

33:07.850 --> 33:09.830
Geez, I'm glad he's dead.

33:09.830 --> 33:12.160
He was an idiot that didn't know who he was dealing with.

33:12.650 --> 33:14.580
You'll die too, Long-nose!

33:16.100 --> 33:17.670
Listen, Chopper!

33:17.670 --> 33:19.070
For a man!

33:19.070 --> 33:20.260
Mogurazuka Highway

33:19.070 --> 33:20.260
Mogurazuka: Molehill

33:27.690 --> 33:30.030
4 Ton Bat position!

33:30.030 --> 33:30.730
Here we go,

33:30.730 --> 33:31.770
Mogurazuka...

33:34.910 --> 33:36.330
Yonban Kousaten! 

33:34.910 --> 33:36.330
Yonban Kousaten: Intersection No. 4

33:38.960 --> 33:39.980
Usopp!

33:43.310 --> 33:44.360
Bastards!

33:44.990 --> 33:46.020
You...!

33:47.920 --> 33:49.770
No matter who the enemy is...

33:49.770 --> 33:52.810
There's a time when you must fight...

33:52.810 --> 33:53.880
You still...!

33:53.880 --> 33:58.290
That time is... when someone makes fun of the dream of a nakama.

33:59.810 --> 34:01.960
Luffy can't be dead.

34:01.960 --> 34:06.010
Because he'll definitely become the Pirate King!

34:06.260 --> 34:08.719
Don't you dare make fun of that!

34:09.780 --> 34:10.860
One more time.

34:10.860 --> 34:11.630
Take position!

34:14.600 --> 34:16.690
Like I'd let you do that!

34:19.020 --> 34:21.420
Chopper, get behind me!

34:21.420 --> 34:22.230
Got it!

34:22.610 --> 34:23.360
Take this!

34:23.360 --> 34:23.880
Hissatsu!

34:24.050 --> 34:24.679
Here we go

34:24.679 --> 34:25.590
Mogurazuka

34:26.949 --> 34:28.179
Kemuri Boshi

34:26.949 --> 34:28.179
Kemuri Boshi: Smoke Star

34:30.889 --> 34:33.010
I'll leave it to you, Chopper!

34:33.010 --> 34:34.750
That kid took off his shoes!

34:37.090 --> 34:37.949
What?!

34:37.949 --> 34:39.710
Mogurazuka Yonban Kousaten!

34:40.889 --> 34:42.489
W-wait! It's me!

34:43.630 --> 34:45.080
Idio-! Sto...

34:51.100 --> 34:51.909
Hissatsu

34:51.909 --> 34:53.120
UsoCho

34:51.909 --> 34:53.110
UsoCho: Usopp & Chopper

34:56.020 --> 34:58.330
Hammer Comet

35:34.820 --> 35:37.260
Even you doubt Papa, Leader?

35:37.770 --> 35:39.570
Go back, someone will hear you.

35:39.570 --> 35:40.350
Wait.

35:40.350 --> 35:41.810
I'll definitely prove it to you.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.780
So please, stop the fight!

35:46.290 --> 35:47.740
Vivi!

35:50.550 --> 35:51.530
Are you alright, Kohza?

35:53.680 --> 35:57.370
Now, I will enter the palace to demand Cobra's surrender.

35:57.650 --> 35:58.890
Don't be foolish.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.750
The royal army's main force is surrounding the palace.

36:02.030 --> 36:04.470
It isn't necessary for you to go there alone!

36:05.280 --> 36:06.720
It's too late...

36:07.270 --> 36:08.430
Cover me.

36:08.430 --> 36:10.140
Oi! Kohza!

36:11.010 --> 36:11.990
You!

36:11.990 --> 36:14.100
The townspeople must hurry up and take refuge.

36:14.770 --> 36:16.780
Leave this town at once!

36:18.260 --> 36:20.020
Are you listening, woman?

36:21.010 --> 36:22.170
Vivi-sama?

36:23.770 --> 36:25.190
Vivi-sama!

36:26.420 --> 36:28.680
Please take me to where Chaka is.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.400
There's something I need to discuss with him.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.420
Make them retreat!

36:43.030 --> 36:43.960
Fight them back!

36:47.790 --> 36:49.220
Don't falter!

36:49.220 --> 36:49.920
Advance!

36:59.030 --> 37:03.850
You seem to be nothing more than words, right?

37:04.190 --> 37:07.060
You... damn... okama bastard...

37:07.060 --> 37:08.320
Stop messing...

37:08.520 --> 37:10.520
Around.

37:11.010 --> 37:13.360
Damn... so cute...

37:14.880 --> 37:19.080
But, this country is really hot...

37:20.360 --> 37:22.410
I feel like getting rid of these clothes

37:22.690 --> 37:24.260
Need a hand?!

37:24.260 --> 37:25.370
Okama Chop

37:25.370 --> 37:27.000
My eyes!

37:27.330 --> 37:28.310
It's about time...

37:28.310 --> 37:31.100
To end this!

37:36.120 --> 37:37.300
Okama Kenpou

37:37.890 --> 37:39.370
That day of summer...

37:39.370 --> 37:40.770
Memories

37:41.660 --> 37:42.390
You... could it be...

37:45.730 --> 37:46.650
Joue

37:45.730 --> 37:46.650
Joue: Cheek

37:47.460 --> 37:49.200
Shot

37:52.740 --> 37:54.860
I've seen through the mane mane fruit.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.400
What?

37:57.400 --> 38:01.740
In the moment before you attack me, you're forced to turn back into an okama.

38:02.460 --> 38:04.950
As long as you're Nami-san, you can't use your kenpou, right?

38:04.970 --> 38:05.960
Sign: Bull's-eye

38:06.280 --> 38:09.040
Eh? I can't hear you at all!

38:09.040 --> 38:10.420
I got the correct answer, didn't I?

38:10.940 --> 38:13.020
So what?!

38:15.160 --> 38:17.840
Let me show you, the okama kenpou...

38:17.840 --> 38:18.370
Prima!

38:20.360 --> 38:20.970
Un...

38:21.610 --> 38:22.110
Deux...

38:31.430 --> 38:32.180
Longe.

38:31.430 --> 38:32.180
Longe: Loin

38:32.850 --> 38:33.460
Tendron.

38:32.850 --> 38:33.460
Tendron: Collar

38:39.430 --> 38:40.800
Cuisseau

38:39.430 --> 38:40.800
Cuisseau: Thigh

38:41.110 --> 38:41.700
Jarret

38:41.110 --> 38:41.700
Jarret: Shank

38:39.920 --> 38:42.270
Un... Deux... Trois

38:42.280 --> 38:44.080
Un... Deux... Trois

39:02.100 --> 39:04.500
Bombardier Arabesque

39:04.500 --> 39:06.490
Veau Shot

39:04.500 --> 39:06.490
Veau: Veal

39:30.320 --> 39:33.550
There's quite a number of broken bones again.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.520
Protect Alubarna!

39:44.510 --> 39:47.360
Capture Sir Crocodile?

39:47.570 --> 39:50.730
If only everyone could see me for a few seconds...

39:50.730 --> 39:52.740
I might be able to do something.

39:53.150 --> 39:54.240
Destroy...

39:55.840 --> 39:56.990
This palace!

39:57.910 --> 40:00.020
What're you saying, Princess?

40:00.020 --> 40:01.770
Have you lost your mind?

40:01.770 --> 40:04.110
Vivi-sama, if we do something like that...

40:04.110 --> 40:05.870
If we do something like that, what?

40:06.440 --> 40:08.380
This country will be finished?

40:09.210 --> 40:10.420
You're wrong.

40:10.420 --> 40:11.970
They said,

40:11.970 --> 40:13.190
This is only the beginning...

40:14.330 --> 40:14.970
Of the country!

40:17.520 --> 40:17.930
Listen...

40:18.840 --> 40:21.060
The country is the people.

40:25.730 --> 40:26.870
Vivi-sama.

40:30.230 --> 40:31.760
As you wish.

40:32.610 --> 40:33.390
Soldiers.

40:33.390 --> 40:36.200
Set all the gathered gunpowder around the palace base!

40:36.370 --> 40:37.450
Impossible.

40:37.450 --> 40:39.480
They actually intend to do it...

40:39.480 --> 40:42.010
A royal palace that has 4000 years of history.

40:43.930 --> 40:46.030
If we don't gain something from this solution...

40:46.030 --> 40:47.780
It's okay, I'm aware of it.

40:47.780 --> 40:51.920
You won't have any other way to counter the rebel army.

40:52.440 --> 40:55.630
I'm sorry, the country is in an emergency situation.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.550
However, it isn't over yet.

40:58.550 --> 41:00.490
Even if we manage to stop this rebellion,

41:00.490 --> 41:03.910
As long as Crocodile is alive, this country will not have peace.

41:05.620 --> 41:06.740
This bothers me.

41:09.850 --> 41:11.690
Isn't this a dangerous thing to do?

41:11.920 --> 41:14.590
Soon this place will become my house.

41:14.590 --> 41:16.400
Crocodile!

41:22.510 --> 41:24.820
Well, well, if it isn't the princess.

41:25.560 --> 41:26.240
Papa!

41:26.240 --> 41:26.910
Your Majesty!

41:29.200 --> 41:30.920
Vivi, why're you here?

41:34.810 --> 41:35.450
Well?

41:35.450 --> 41:36.260
Have you resigned?

41:36.770 --> 41:38.180
That would be you!

41:38.180 --> 41:39.510
Thunderbolt Tempo

41:42.250 --> 41:43.920
Sparkling Deity

41:47.320 --> 41:48.020
Blow away.

41:58.580 --> 41:59.400
Unforgivable.

42:04.170 --> 42:05.500
Sea Urchin

42:05.870 --> 42:07.070
Stinger

42:12.820 --> 42:16.680
This doesn't hurt... even a bit...

42:17.660 --> 42:20.340
Can you understand her pain?

42:20.810 --> 42:22.230
Compared to that...

42:22.230 --> 42:24.930
1, 2, or 3 legs...

42:24.930 --> 42:26.060
Don't matter!

42:27.130 --> 42:29.530
Tornado Tempo

42:44.060 --> 42:45.730
What? What? What?!

43:26.430 --> 43:27.710
Why...?

43:29.100 --> 43:32.000
Why are you here?!

43:32.420 --> 43:33.330
Where's Luffy-san?!

43:33.810 --> 43:35.040
He died.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.200
You're lying!

43:36.200 --> 43:39.380
There's no way Luffy-san would get killed by you!

43:40.340 --> 43:41.780
You think so?

43:43.350 --> 43:44.140
The door just!

43:44.410 --> 43:45.540
Go back to the palace.

43:45.540 --> 43:46.720
Open the gate!

43:47.090 --> 43:49.230
Dieciséis Fleur

43:47.090 --> 43:49.230
Dieciséis Fleur: Sixteen Flowers

43:50.320 --> 43:50.930
What?

43:50.930 --> 43:51.980
Hands?

43:55.920 --> 43:58.020
Why you... Crocodile!

43:58.580 --> 44:00.840
Idiots should be quiet.

44:00.840 --> 44:04.320
Cobra, I have just one question for you.

44:04.900 --> 44:07.860
Because this is my ultimate goal,

44:10.880 --> 44:13.040
Where's Pluton?

44:29.890 --> 44:31.890
Spiral Hollow

44:58.190 --> 45:00.420
I... am not at his level...

45:07.200 --> 45:08.340
Spar Break

45:33.700 --> 45:34.490
Bastard!

45:34.490 --> 45:35.790
What the hell did you do?

45:35.790 --> 45:37.120
Just getting hit with that technique...

45:37.900 --> 45:39.720
I can hear it.

45:39.720 --> 45:41.880
His iron's breathing...

45:42.600 --> 45:43.990
Fine.

45:43.990 --> 45:46.800
With the next strike, I'll totally stop your breathing.

45:50.020 --> 45:53.720
Don't think that you can stop my technique with just one katana.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.470
It's okay.

45:57.670 --> 45:59.190
I won't get hit anymore.

45:59.630 --> 46:01.340
You seem prepared...

46:01.340 --> 46:02.650
Fine then!

46:03.570 --> 46:05.910
Ittouryuu Iai

46:03.570 --> 46:05.910
Ittouryuu Iai: One Sword Style Sword Draw

46:05.910 --> 46:07.610
Shishi Sonson

46:05.910 --> 46:07.610
Shishi Sonson: Lion Song

46:08.020 --> 46:09.870
Atomic Spurt

46:28.140 --> 46:29.890
I thank you.

46:34.450 --> 46:35.310
Idiot...

46:35.720 --> 46:36.930
Why're you crying?

46:36.930 --> 46:38.680
Because that mole-hag said...

46:38.680 --> 46:40.900
Luffy is dead.

46:41.410 --> 46:42.610
I wonder if it's true.

46:43.440 --> 46:44.940
You guys believe that?

46:45.270 --> 46:48.070
Like I'm gonna believe it! You idiot!

46:48.070 --> 46:48.880
Me neither!

46:48.880 --> 46:50.400
I definitely don't believe it!

46:50.860 --> 46:54.830
In that case, we need to hurry and catch up with everyone.

46:54.830 --> 46:56.840
Wipe your nose.

46:56.840 --> 46:59.090
This bloodshed must be stopped.

47:06.580 --> 47:08.050
Finally got it.

47:16.930 --> 47:18.940
Where's Pluton?

47:22.120 --> 47:24.400
Bastard... how do you know that name...?

47:24.820 --> 47:26.570
Such a thing is... in this country...?

47:27.010 --> 47:29.280
The secret passed down with the throne succession...

47:31.550 --> 47:36.390
If I have it, I can build the greatest military country.

47:36.390 --> 47:40.200
A country with the power to even surpass that of the World Government.

47:40.400 --> 47:43.300
I don't know where you heard the name of Pluton, but...

47:43.300 --> 47:45.660
Even I don't know its whereabouts.

47:45.660 --> 47:48.920
I'm not sure if that thing even exists.

47:49.090 --> 47:50.500
I see...

47:51.190 --> 47:54.390
By the way, the plaza where the royal army is gathered...

47:54.620 --> 47:56.090
Today at 4:30 p.m., in other words,

47:56.090 --> 48:00.810
In 15 minutes, a powerful bomb will be shot according to the plan.

48:02.370 --> 48:03.850
Are you insane, bastard?!

48:04.250 --> 48:06.910
Its explosion will cover 5 km in diameter.

48:06.910 --> 48:10.400
From this place, we could have a nice view of the change in the landscape.

48:10.400 --> 48:11.380
If you do such a thing...!

48:11.380 --> 48:12.170
Aren't you happy?

48:12.170 --> 48:15.990
When both armies die, this rebellion will finally end.

48:15.990 --> 48:18.730
What have they ever done to you!

48:18.730 --> 48:19.400
Vivi-sama.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.740
How can you do such a thing?!

48:22.290 --> 48:25.960
Well then, Mr. Cobra, back to the question.

48:25.960 --> 48:28.760
The poneglyph that has been passed down for generations by the royal family...

48:28.760 --> 48:29.880
Where is it?

48:31.210 --> 48:33.800
If I take you to that place...

48:34.300 --> 48:35.590
No,

48:35.590 --> 48:38.010
I'll guide you... to the Hall of Burials.

48:39.750 --> 48:41.280
You're a wise ruler, Cobra.

48:41.280 --> 48:43.470
Accompany him to the Hall of Burials, Nico Robin.

48:43.790 --> 48:44.510
Understood.

48:55.640 --> 48:56.760
Papa!

48:56.760 --> 48:57.310
Hey,

48:58.000 --> 48:59.950
Who said you could go?

49:00.380 --> 49:03.260
Get your hands off Vivi-sama, traitor!

49:04.830 --> 49:06.420
Oh? Zoan type.

49:06.670 --> 49:08.830
Inu: Dog

49:06.660 --> 49:08.830
Inu inu fruit, model jackal.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.060
Nari Kiba

49:10.000 --> 49:11.060
Nari Kiba: Roaring Fang

49:16.450 --> 49:17.380
Chaka...

49:18.730 --> 49:21.060
You also intend to die for the sake of a stranger...?

49:21.060 --> 49:21.600
Vivi!

49:22.070 --> 49:22.610
Kohza!

49:22.610 --> 49:24.550
Are my eyes deceiving me?

49:24.780 --> 49:28.400
The rebel army leader shouldn't show up in this place!

49:33.430 --> 49:34.090
Kohza...

49:34.090 --> 49:35.850
Hang in there, Kohza!

49:36.410 --> 49:39.740
I came to... try to persuade the royal army... but...

49:41.050 --> 49:42.840
Everything was...

49:44.630 --> 49:45.830
My doing...

49:46.600 --> 49:48.120
Kohza.

49:50.480 --> 49:52.010
Zoro! Zoro!

49:52.010 --> 49:53.210
Wake up!

49:55.620 --> 49:58.070
This place has become very violent.

49:58.070 --> 49:58.630
Let's hurry!

50:00.730 --> 50:03.920
Without the king or the leader of the rebellion...

50:03.920 --> 50:07.600
This has already become lizards with their heads ripped off killing each other.

50:13.230 --> 50:14.630
A sudden sandstorm...

50:14.630 --> 50:16.010
I can't see what's in front.

50:17.700 --> 50:18.710
Don't falter!

50:18.710 --> 50:19.610
Hit them!

50:20.310 --> 50:22.080
What's with this storm?

50:22.370 --> 50:24.720
Don't lose formation!

50:25.660 --> 50:27.790
Fire back! Royal army!

50:40.180 --> 50:41.760
I...

50:42.050 --> 50:43.680
Can't give up.

50:43.910 --> 50:47.850
If we stop the explosion, we can decrease the number of victims.

50:48.200 --> 50:50.010
If I do this I can stop the rebellion.

50:50.010 --> 50:51.560
If I do that I can stop the rebellion.

50:51.780 --> 50:55.280
Your pathetic idealism disgusts me.

50:55.280 --> 50:57.490
I don't care if it disgusts you...

50:57.490 --> 50:58.990
I won't abandon my ideals...

50:59.310 --> 51:00.950
A very devoted woman you are.

51:01.140 --> 51:04.140
In the end, you couldn't stop anything.

51:04.140 --> 51:07.920
The only thing your attachment to your idealism caused was an increase in the number of innocent victims!

51:07.920 --> 51:09.910
I already told you!

51:10.440 --> 51:13.490
You can't save this country!

51:21.410 --> 51:23.340
Vivi...

51:23.620 --> 51:25.300
Vivi!

51:26.020 --> 51:27.260
VIVI!

51:28.210 --> 51:29.720
Luffy... san.

51:30.300 --> 51:31.540
Don't...

51:31.540 --> 51:32.690
GIVE UP YET!

51:33.250 --> 51:34.190
Luffy-san!

51:39.900 --> 51:41.270
Just in time.

51:42.010 --> 51:44.010
Luffy-san... Pell...

51:44.900 --> 51:48.060
My voice won't reach anyone anymore...

51:48.060 --> 51:48.950
Don't worry.

51:50.090 --> 51:52.970
We can hear your voice.

51:54.590 --> 51:55.080
Zoro.

51:55.080 --> 51:56.250
Look at that! Over there!

51:57.170 --> 51:59.050
Luffy is alive! Vivi too!

52:00.060 --> 52:01.250
Didn't I tell you?!

52:01.250 --> 52:02.180
I knew it all along!

52:02.600 --> 52:04.140
Is that the look of a guy who knew?

52:05.060 --> 52:07.150
Wait for me, Vivi-chan!

52:07.150 --> 52:08.450
Let's hurry up, Zoro!

52:08.450 --> 52:11.710
It's evident my wounds are more serious.

52:11.710 --> 52:14.100
My feet are hurt, I can't stand up!

52:14.100 --> 52:15.100
Liar.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.700
You can read the poneglyph?

52:18.700 --> 52:19.510
Yes.

52:19.510 --> 52:22.850
That's the main reason I associated with Crocodile.

52:22.850 --> 52:24.570
That's why he won't kill me.

52:25.740 --> 52:26.530
I see.

52:27.090 --> 52:29.250
The location of Pluton... as I thought is...

52:32.730 --> 52:34.700
Is there any other?

52:34.700 --> 52:37.090
Is this the only one in this country?

52:37.090 --> 52:38.130
Are you disappointed...?

52:38.130 --> 52:39.670
I kept my promise...

52:38.880 --> 52:39.670
Why?!

52:42.640 --> 52:45.410
What I seek isn't here either...

52:45.410 --> 52:47.340
Was it as he said, Nico Robin?

52:48.060 --> 52:49.670
That was fast.

52:49.670 --> 52:51.450
Did you managed to decipher it?

52:51.450 --> 52:51.810
Yes.

52:52.210 --> 52:53.880
In that case, hurry up and tell me Pluton's whereabo...

52:53.880 --> 52:55.710
It's not written here.

52:55.710 --> 52:56.270
What?

52:56.520 --> 52:58.730
Nothing more than history is written here.

52:59.630 --> 53:03.340
Nothing like the word Pluton appears here.

53:03.340 --> 53:04.950
I see, it's a shame.

53:05.570 --> 53:07.660
You have been an excellent partner but,

53:08.300 --> 53:09.950
You're going to die right here.

53:12.960 --> 53:14.850
I'm putting an end to all this!

53:15.170 --> 53:16.010
Yes!

53:17.120 --> 53:18.330
Vivi!

53:18.540 --> 53:19.890
Vivi-chan!

53:19.890 --> 53:20.790
Are you alright?

53:22.520 --> 53:23.340
Vivi!

53:23.700 --> 53:25.800
We're also here!

53:27.090 --> 53:28.760
Everyone is safe...

53:32.940 --> 53:34.430
Are you alright, Luffy-kun?

53:34.610 --> 53:35.720
Yeah...

53:37.180 --> 53:39.350
What you see below is the Hall of Burials.

53:39.600 --> 53:40.680
I see.

53:40.680 --> 53:42.080
Just you wait...!

53:42.080 --> 53:44.150
Croc!

53:52.860 --> 53:55.240
Just 5 minutes to search for the bombardiers?

53:55.690 --> 53:59.230
Crocodile created this sandstorm in order to...

53:59.230 --> 54:03.210
Hide the bomb that is going to be fired at the plaza, so the bombardiers must be nearby.

54:05.360 --> 54:06.670
Then, high places should be suspected.

54:07.150 --> 54:08.130
High places?

54:08.380 --> 54:12.040
It's gonna be a 5 km in diameter blast, so that's the most probable thing to do.

54:12.040 --> 54:15.100
Besides, it's more reliable to shoot down from above than from the ground.

54:15.540 --> 54:17.060
Amazing, Usopp!

54:17.060 --> 54:19.140
I'm a sniper after all.

54:19.140 --> 54:20.270
That's enough information.

54:20.270 --> 54:20.860
Let's hurry.

54:20.860 --> 54:22.140
Oi!

54:20.860 --> 54:22.140
Yes!

54:22.140 --> 54:23.910
I was born a talented genius...

54:23.910 --> 54:26.620
Equal parts natural ability and heredity...

54:26.620 --> 54:28.240
Huh? Wait...

54:28.520 --> 54:29.950
Water?

54:30.680 --> 54:32.910
But it's meaningless if you can't hit me.

54:35.230 --> 54:37.700
I forgive everything, Nico Robin.

54:37.700 --> 54:38.790
Because I...

54:39.150 --> 54:41.250
From the very beginning...

54:42.100 --> 54:44.710
Didn't trust anyone!

54:44.870 --> 54:48.670
I can tell by Cobra's reaction that Pluton really exists.

54:49.060 --> 54:50.530
I'll just search for it myself.

54:50.530 --> 54:54.350
When this country falls into my hands, it'll be just a matter of time.

55:02.890 --> 55:05.290
It's still too soon for the bombardment on the plaza.

55:05.290 --> 55:05.940
You?!

55:06.400 --> 55:11.150
This Hall of Burials was designed to collapse upon the removal of a single stone.

55:11.830 --> 55:15.330
Under the name of the twelfth king in the Nefertari dynasty.

55:15.330 --> 55:18.080
I won't let you have this country of sand.

55:18.190 --> 55:21.190
So you want to bury me alive in this place.

55:21.190 --> 55:24.040
You're such a devoted king.

55:24.420 --> 55:26.250
But, I can't be killed.

55:26.430 --> 55:29.520
If I turn everything into sand I can get out.

55:30.740 --> 55:34.490
You'll die in vain, Mr. Cobra.

55:42.440 --> 55:43.890
Found you, croc.

55:44.210 --> 55:44.970
You.

55:44.970 --> 55:46.520
How did you escape from that quicksand...?

55:47.030 --> 55:48.480
Why're you alive?

55:49.080 --> 55:52.880
Why do you keep standing in my way?!

55:52.880 --> 55:55.160
Eh?! Strawhat!

55:58.420 --> 56:00.950
You haven't returned it yet...

56:01.980 --> 56:03.420
What you stole.

56:03.700 --> 56:05.320
What I stole?

56:05.320 --> 56:06.290
Money?

56:06.750 --> 56:07.750
Fame?

56:08.150 --> 56:09.210
Trust?

56:09.700 --> 56:10.670
Lives?

56:11.100 --> 56:12.130
Rain?

56:12.190 --> 56:13.250
The country!

56:23.860 --> 56:25.320
Impossible...

56:26.660 --> 56:30.530
Crocodile!

56:35.070 --> 56:37.070
You... it can't be...

56:37.810 --> 56:39.600
When I was stuck in the desert...

56:39.600 --> 56:43.020
I realized it when your hand touched Yuba's water.

56:43.020 --> 56:46.260
If you touch water, you can't turn into sand.

56:46.260 --> 56:47.330
But, blood is the same, isn't it?

56:48.650 --> 56:49.860
Fine then.

56:49.860 --> 56:54.550
I'll let you see hell one more time as a reward for your tenacity in challenging me.

56:54.900 --> 56:55.970
As a pirate.

56:57.370 --> 56:58.090
What's that?

56:58.830 --> 57:00.100
Poison needle.

57:00.630 --> 57:01.390
I see.

57:01.910 --> 57:05.850
A pirate's duel is a survival battle in which you put your life on the line.

57:06.310 --> 57:08.810
Words such as "unfair" don't exist in it.

57:09.620 --> 57:11.530
This is the last one.

57:12.950 --> 57:14.490
Let's finish this once and for...

57:14.490 --> 57:15.490
All!

57:16.430 --> 57:18.170
What're you doing?!

57:18.170 --> 57:19.610
Thinking like Crocodile...

57:19.610 --> 57:20.830
Shut up and keep searching!

57:21.400 --> 57:22.530
Chopper!

57:22.530 --> 57:24.250
Can't you find it using your nose?

57:24.370 --> 57:25.270
Impossible.

57:25.270 --> 57:27.460
The whole town is filled with the smell of gunpowder.

57:27.560 --> 57:30.420
Then, follow the scent of whatever is aiming at the plaza...

57:30.420 --> 57:31.920
What smell is that?!

57:32.140 --> 57:33.990
Anyway, it's a huge bomb.

57:33.990 --> 57:35.880
And it also needs room to shoot out of the cannon and fall down.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.180
There's no time left.

57:50.570 --> 57:51.730
Oi!

57:51.730 --> 57:52.310
What's wrong, Vivi?

57:52.740 --> 57:54.910
Why didn't I realize it...

57:54.910 --> 57:57.810
It has to be there, a spacious place people wouldn't notice.

57:57.810 --> 58:00.370
The place where I used to play when I was little.

58:00.370 --> 58:01.090
Vivi, if we don't hurry...

58:01.090 --> 58:01.820
Vivi! Usopp!

58:02.220 --> 58:03.050
Did you find it?

58:03.050 --> 58:03.780
Well, no, that...

58:03.780 --> 58:05.470
Usopp-san, I got it!

58:05.470 --> 58:06.180
Really?

58:06.180 --> 58:07.210
Then, I'll call everyone.

58:12.740 --> 58:13.790
So, where is it?

58:13.790 --> 58:14.260
Over there!

58:16.410 --> 58:18.360
It's impossible in 1 minute.

58:18.360 --> 58:19.430
Nami-san!

58:19.880 --> 58:20.890
Vivi-chan!

58:20.890 --> 58:23.350
You guys, did you find the bombardiers?

58:25.550 --> 58:27.830
Why in the world are you up there?!

58:27.830 --> 58:29.140
Huh? I unintentionally...

58:29.410 --> 58:31.780
Usopp! Hurry, we're out of time!

58:31.780 --> 58:32.860
T-that's right.

58:33.260 --> 58:35.810
Honestly, there's no way we can make it in time.

58:35.810 --> 58:37.320
If only Pell came...

58:37.660 --> 58:40.080
The bombardiers are above the clock tower!

58:40.080 --> 58:42.100
You guys jump to the clock place!

58:42.100 --> 58:42.780
Don't talk nonsense!

58:43.030 --> 58:45.230
Use your legs or katana, but do something!

58:45.230 --> 58:45.740
That's it!

58:54.000 --> 58:59.090
Gero, gero, gero, gero…

58:54.000 --> 58:59.090
Gero gero: The sound a frog makes

58:59.420 --> 59:02.300
Gero, gero, gero, the trophy from before sure was big.

59:02.590 --> 59:03.790
That's right.

59:12.930 --> 59:14.690
Gero, gero, gero, gero, but,

59:14.690 --> 59:16.610
This time I think it'll be even bigger.

59:16.860 --> 59:18.400
That's right.

59:18.940 --> 59:23.030
We just have to shoot this huge cannonball into the middle of the crowd.

59:23.030 --> 59:23.920
Isn't it good?

59:57.700 --> 59:59.070
Gomu Gomu no

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.060
Soon the poison will take effect.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.220
The battle is over.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.690
So what?!

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.070
You don't understand anything at all.

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:42.530
What...

01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:44.950
Understand?

01:00:58.210 --> 01:00:59.340
Gomu Gomu no

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.420
Gatling

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.580
Don't you understand?

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.270
You're already dead.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.750
The poison already entered through your wound.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.990
It's over.

01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:38.840
What?

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:46.970
Why?

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.460
Why do you go that far?!

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:52.860
Your goal isn't in this country!

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.930
Will you die for such a thing?!

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:58.230
You all are so stupid.

01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:59.400
Vivi...

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:03.220
She tells other people not to die..

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.470
But she's always the first one to throw away her life in order to save other people.

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:10.360
If we leave her alone, she'll die.

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:13.130
Yes, as you just said, I sent her to the next world...

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:14.330
Idiot!

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:16.260
Vivi is safe.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.630
There's no way I'll let her die.

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:19.850
I don't...

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:22.010
I don't want her to die...!

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:24.290
We're nakama!

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.760
That's why, as long as she doesn't give up on the country,

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:31.890
We won't stop fighting!

01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:34.850
Even if you die?

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:38.330
When I die... that will be...

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:38.770
That...

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.780
It doesn't matter how much you shout.

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:53.030
Eventually your body will stop responding to you.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.990
It doesn't matter how much you and your nakama struggle...

01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:00.910
It doesn't matter how many times you stand up to thwart my plan...

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:02.040
Everything...

01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:05.000
Rests on whether you can defeat me.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.960
Gero, it's about time Mr.7.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.930
Preparing to ignite.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:14.040
Gero, gero, ignite!

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:21.640
Oi! Nami! What're you trying to do?!

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:22.680
Shut up!

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.570
Just be quiet and stand there.

01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:25.690
I'm calculating right now.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.450
Even if you say stand there,

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:28.690
I can't understand the meaning of this posture.

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:30.040
If I do it, you'll understand.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.180
Here I go!

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.320
The weather is typhoon!

01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:35.310
Cyclone Tempo

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.430
O-oi!

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:40.190
Cyclone tempo is just an instrument to have fun at parties...

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:43.280
The objective is the clock tower.

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.120
Chopper!

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.540
Jump to where Sanji-kun is!

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.050
Could it be that, the plan is...

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.300
To keep flying until we reach the top?

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.670
Sanji-kun!

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:53.760
You know the rest, right?

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.260
There's no time!

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:58.480
I can somewhat tell what Nami-san's intentions are...

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:58.930
Yosh!

01:03:58.930 --> 01:03:59.720
There's nothing but to do it!

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.030
There's no time to think about it.

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:03.230
Please, Tony-kun.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.610
Yosh!

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:05.730
Hang on tight!

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:07.940
I see.

01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:09.480
Sanji!

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.540
Get onto my right leg!

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:13.280
There they go, Zoro!

01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:16.240
Yosh, as I thought!

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.790
Zoro!

01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.280
Leave it to me.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.380
Katana?!

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:27.770
Don't be scared.

01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:29.420
I'm using the back of the swords.

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.440
Got it!

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.380
Fly!

01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:34.230
Go!

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:37.000
Gero?

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.230
Here we go, Vivi!

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:41.470
Please, give it all you got!

01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:43.480
Go!

01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:46.270
Kujakki String

01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:46.270
Kujakki: Peacock

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.350
Slasher

01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:52.670
Gero, gero, it's a shame.

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:53.570
You missed.

01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:55.280
Run back.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.780
Alright!

01:04:59.220 --> 01:04:59.740
Sorry.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:19.220
It's over!

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.150
D-did she stop it?

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.350
How long are you planning on staying there...!

01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:32.470
What happened?

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:34.390
Vivi hasn't come out.

01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:42.830
It can't be...

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:45.790
What a cowardly act!

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.820
That's what you call being careful in an assault.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:50.750
Mr. Cobra.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.720
You should make preparations for every possible accident in the plan.

01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.930
The difference is 2 minutes.

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:02.300
This can't be...

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:04.820
The bomb has a timer!

01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:07.480
At this rate, it will blow up!

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.780
What did you say?!

01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:18.860
Preventing the destruction of the plaza was impossible from the beginning?

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:23.710
How long are you going to make fun of people...

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.080
You can't save the country.

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:30.830
How long until you're satisfied with ridiculing the people?

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:46.640
There's no way...

01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:58.990
You can defeat me!

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.950
Are these the only words you can squeeze out?

01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:05.660
What you just blabbed sounded like the bluff of a loser.

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:07.620
Without support.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:08.580
I am...

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.190
The man who will become the Pirate King!

01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:15.840
I already told you!

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:20.470
There are many rookies like you in this sea!

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:24.510
The more you get to know the level of this sea...

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:27.140
The more you lose sight of those dreams!

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.570
I am...

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:40.630
The man...

01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:42.030
Who will surpass you!

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:47.000
It's a nostalgic place, isn't it?

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.630
The Suna Suna Clan secret base.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:50.750
Pell!

01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:53.720
The bomb has a timer.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.720
It'll blow up any minute now!

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:02.220
I no longer...

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.300
Vivi-sama...

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:07.050
I'm really proud from the bottom of my heart...

01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:13.000
To have served the Nefertari family.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:25.330
Pell!

01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:44.750
I am...

01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:46.760
The Guardian of Arabasta!

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:53.490
The Falcon!

01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:59.279
The one who destroys...

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:05.520
The royal family's enemies!

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:26.080
Hey, Pell.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:26.660
Yes?

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:29.740
Why do you practice fencing everyday?

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.250
Because I'm a guardian.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.560
In order to protect this country,

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.160
I need to become stronger.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.090
Who are you going to fight?

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:37.970
Well...

01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:40.520
It's more about protecting than fighting.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.060
Is it different?

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.760
The intention is different.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.109
That's strange.

01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:49.490
Pell...

01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:51.210
That bastard...

01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:53.050
He protected the country.

01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:55.160
Oi.

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.460
No way.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.230
Why don't they stop?

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.430
Please stop!

01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:34.450
PLEASE, STOP FIGHTING!

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:38.200
PLEASE, STOP FIGHTING!

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.880
Please, stop fighting!

01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:43.130
Vivi...

01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:46.350
PLEASE, STOP FIGHTING!

01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:49.300
Please, stop fighting!

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.710
You idiot...

01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:53.970
What're you just standing there for?!

01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:57.480
Punch them, kick them, and stop the rebellion!

01:10:58.530 --> 01:11:01.810
The scorpion's venom, without a doubt, has already taken effect.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.530
Where does this kid get his power from...?

01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:12.990
Who do you think I am?!

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:16.200
I don't care who the hell you are!

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:18.010
I...!

01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:18.910
Will...!

01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:21.370
Surpass you!

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.210
Bastard!

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:30.510
Sables Pesado

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:30.510
Sables Pesado: Heavy Sabers

01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:52.990
Gomu Gomu no

01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:54.830
Desert

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:56.450
Storm!

01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:58.030
La Espada

01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:36.990
Oi! Look at that!

01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:48.590
Crocodile!

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.740
Luffy... san...

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:03.520
Oi, you!

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.520
Even when there's no enemy...

01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:15.080
Are you alright?

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:18.250
This is...

01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:27.710
Please, don't shed more blood.

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:34.400
Please... STOP FIGHTING!

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:49.600
Rain...

01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:54.150
It rained!

01:13:55.910 --> 01:14:00.370
Just like it's raining now, it will rain again like it did before.

01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:03.160
Vivi's voice reached them.

01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:05.000
It's Vivi-sama.

01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:06.830
Vivi-sama...

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:13.000
The nightmare has ended.

01:14:18.930 --> 01:14:20.960
I thank you.

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.600
Don't mention it.

01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:33.670
Armies, drop your weapons!

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:34.710
Chaka-sama!

01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:35.900
Kohza-san!

01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:39.960
This battle was being manipulated from the beginning!

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.490
By Crocodile!

01:14:54.810 --> 01:14:56.760
Everyone... where are you?

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:01.500
He came.

01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:04.300
You guys are...?

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:07.760
Thanks for bringing that guy you've got on your back.

01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:09.270
He's one of ours.

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:10.520
The one in charge.

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.010
Everyone!

01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:12.910
Papa?

01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:13.740
It's Vivi!

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:14.770
Vivi...

01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:18.190
I see, so you're the ones who brought Vivi...

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.000
He's the one who saved us.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.910
After fighting Crocodile, even with that wounded body of his, he carried two people out to the exit.

01:15:26.150 --> 01:15:28.120
What impressive will power...

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.880
Let's hurry and treat his wounds.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:30.750
You guys too.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.920
Anyway, Vivi, you should hurry back to the plaza.

01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:39.190
At long last, after stopping the country's rebellion, a speech from the king and the princess...

01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:40.330
Is to be expected.

01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:41.930
Then, everyone also...

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:43.900
You understand, right?

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:49.770
We're just common people, we have nothing to do with this country or anything.

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.520
I'm hungry.

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.940
You can go to the palace if you want.

01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:56.310
I'm exhausted.

01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:57.000
Yes.

01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:08.330
Lamenting is natural.

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:10.700
The thoughts of regret are also natural.

01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:13.920
The losses are many, the winnings are not.

01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:16.160
King.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.840
However, this is the time to move forward.

01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:21.280
No matter who the enemy we fought was...

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.470
The battle that occurred here, is over now.

01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:29.310
No one can change what happened in the past!

01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:32.890
Let's stand above this war and show that we can keep existing!

01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:36.500
Kingdom of Arabasta!

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.210
Look, Kohza.

01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:49.740
It rained.

01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:53.490
Just 3 years...

01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:55.730
It just took that time...

01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:57.510
Right?

01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:59.000
Rain...

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.930
You are still awake, Vivi?

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:23.530
Papa...

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.490
You can't sleep?

01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:28.730
It's just that I don't want to sleep yet.

01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:33.260
I want to look at this rain a little more...

01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:38.470
Already the rain that wasn't forced to fall...

01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:42.760
For three days that rain hasn't stopped falling on this kingdom.

01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:48.340
What a great nap!

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:49.980
Luffy!

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.870
Ah! Where's my hat?

01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:58.380
Hat...

01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:59.470
I'm hungry!

01:17:59.470 --> 01:18:00.080
Where's breakfast?

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:00.670
Where's my hat?

01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:02.110
I'm hungry!

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.610
What a nice nap.

01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:03.290
I'm hungry.

01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:04.060
I'm hungry.

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:04.950
What a nice nap.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.070
I'm glad!

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:08.120
Luffy-san is fully recovered.

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:09.570
Ah! My hat!

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.430
Oh! Thank goodness!

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:14.190
Vivi, it's been a while!

01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:16.560
Ah? A while?

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:19.620
Well, you slept for 3 days, so that means you're recovered, right?

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:21.310
3 days?!

01:18:21.310 --> 01:18:23.880
That means I missed 15 meals?

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.740
How come you're so fast calculating that?

01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:29.050
Although, you calculated 5 meals per day.

01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:32.430
If you want to eat, just say so anytime you want.

01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:41.690
That's dirty!

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:45.370
Ah! Luffy, you got my plate!

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:46.820
Oi, oi.

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:49.090
There's still plenty...

01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:51.250
Are you Wapol?!

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:54.990
Everyone, big trouble!

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.710
A-a marine fleet is coming towards the country.

01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:05.170
Already?

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.790
We'll... there's no reason to keep staying.

01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:09.880
The captain already woke up.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.930
The marines should be coming soon.

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:13.810
Luffy, you decide.

01:19:13.810 --> 01:19:17.060
Yosh! We'll eat Arabasta food one more time and then leave.

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.890
We're leaving sooner! You idiot!

01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:24.320
Hey, everyone...

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:25.910
Vivi...

01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:27.050
I...

01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:28.770
What shall I do?

01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.010
Come with us, Vivi.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.990
Definitely come! Come now!

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.340
Vivi, tomorrow at 12:00 p.m., we'll come by the eastern harbor one last time.

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:44.070
If you want to keep traveling with us, please come.

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:45.950
Then we'll have a welcome party.

01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:47.500
As pirates though.

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.490
You're the princess of a country so,

01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:52.510
That's the best offer we can make.

01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:57.750
Carue...

01:19:58.650 --> 01:20:00.430
What would you want?

01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:02.950
I...

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:08.400
I've been saved twice by two who hold the name "D"...

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:10.860
Monkey D. Luffy and...

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:14.240
Yosh! Let's go up!

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.990
I no longer have a reason to keep living.

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:19.570
Please, put me down!

01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:25.370
Why should I listen to what you say?

01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.500
Jaguar D. Saul...

01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:32.720
Someday, without a doubt, you'll find your nakama.

01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:34.580
There's nothing as absurd as...

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:38.430
Being born into this world to be alone!

01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:42.510
My dream has too many enemies.

01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:44.390
Dereshishishi...

01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:46.820
Dereshishishi...

01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:49.380
They're definitely waiting for you somewhere in this sea...

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:52.320
Go meet your nakama, Robin!

01:20:57.050 --> 01:21:00.470
The plaza is full of people already.

01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:01.510
Really?

01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:05.770
It was announced that Vivi-sama's speech would began at 12:00 p.m.

01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:08.830
Originally, it was going to take place when you were 14 years old...

01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:10.130
Your coming of age ceremony.

01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:13.140
Today, everyone is expecting it.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.750
I'm coming in, Vivi.

01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:22.850
Sit down, Papa.

01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:25.500
No... Father.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.940
I have something important to tell you.

01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:45.900
Look! It's Vivi-sama!

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:47.290
Vivi-sama!

01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:49.140
We've been waiting!

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:50.750
Princess!

01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:53.270
You've grown!

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.310
I went on an adventure just for a while.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.270
Well... it's nothing to be alarmed about.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.370
Kohza! It started already!

01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:13.230
With something as big as that, it can be heard across the whole country.

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:19.040
It started as a journey full of despair across a dark sea.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.200
On my dark journey...

01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:24.870
Inside a storm, I found one small ship.

01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:28.370
The ship pushed my back, saying...

01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:32.430
Can't you see that light?

01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:38.880
Without losing it's course within the darkness, that ship...

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.250
Surpassed the big waves as if it were dancing.

01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:46.090
Never opposing the sea, always going forward!

01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:48.600
Then, a finger raised.

01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:51.470
Look, a light appeared.

01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:56.990
History, before long, will call this an illusion, but...

01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:01.600
To me, that's the only truth!

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.710
Did you hear the speech just now?

01:23:09.710 --> 01:23:11.380
Without a doubt it's Vivi's voice.

01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:12.320
Vivi...

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.160
It might be a voice similar to Vivi's.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.170
It's a ceremony being broadcast from Alubarna.

01:23:16.170 --> 01:23:17.830
She already decided not to come.

01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:19.460
Let's go, it's past 12:00 p.m..

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.670
There's no way she won't come.

01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:22.780
Let's get out and search.

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.020
She must be nearby.

01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.500
This is bad.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.270
The marine fleet is coming.

01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:28.060
They already came?!

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.580
Prepare the ship.

01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:31.480
Give it up, Luffy.

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:32.760
Vivi-chan is a princess.

01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:36.110
What the hell is going on?!

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.070
Show your face, fake princess!

01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:41.730
Where's the real Vivi-sama?!

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.120
Vivi-sama must now be...

01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:51.080
Everyone!

01:23:51.450 --> 01:23:52.310
Vivi!

01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:54.380
Carue!

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:57.090
Everyone!

01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:58.900
See?! She came!

01:23:58.900 --> 01:23:59.450
Vivi!

01:23:59.450 --> 01:24:01.300
Yosh! I'm turning back the ship!

01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:03.150
She came after all!

01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:06.380
Oi! Hurry up and turn back the ship.

01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:07.770
I came...

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.330
To say goodbye!

01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:13.440
What did... she say just now?

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:20.120
I can't go with you!

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.110
Who is she shouting to?

01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:26.240
Really, thank you for everything until now!

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.310
I want to keep going on adventures but, after all I...

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:34.750
Love this country!

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:46.740
So, I can't go...

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.660
I see.

01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:54.780
I...

01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:02.030
I'm... staying here but...

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.000
If someday...

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.490
We meet again...

01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:08.820
Will you one more time...

01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:13.730
Call me Nakama?!

01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:21.800
We'll always be naka...!

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:23.650
Don't answer!

01:25:23.650 --> 01:25:24.760
The marines are nearby.

01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:27.890
If they find out that we have something to do with Vivi...

01:25:28.150 --> 01:25:30.100
Vivi will also become a criminal.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.250
This will have to be a silent farewell.

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:05.000
From now on, if anything happens,

01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.720
Show this on your left arm!

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:36.290
It's the mark of nakama!

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.130
Depart!

01:26:56.870 --> 01:27:02.220
Mamoritai mono ga aru

01:26:56.870 --> 01:27:02.220
There's something I want to protect

01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:08.200
Kono basho de tsuyoku naru kara

01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:08.200
In this place where I became strong

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:18.410
Nigirishimeta kobushi wo mata nigirishimeta

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:18.410
This fist I once clenched tightly, I clenched again

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:29.860
Hontou ni daiji na koto wa kotoba dewa tsutawaranai

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:29.860
The important thing is to convey it in words

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:34.780
Yukkuri to yukkuri to ima

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:34.780
Slowly slowly now

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:41.220
Sono senaka wo mitsumete itanda

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:41.220
I was gazing at that back

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:51.200
Dou ikiru ka wa jibun de kimeru koto da to wakatta

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:51.200
Now I know the way to live is something you decide by yourself

01:27:51.200 --> 01:28:00.790
Hontou no yuuki wa kitto yasashisa dattanda ne

01:27:51.200 --> 01:28:00.790
True courage was definitely graceful, wasn't it?

01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:11.800
Nakanai koto wo kimeta hazu na no ni namida afurete tomaranakatta yo

01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:11.800
Although I decided not to cry, I couldn't stop the tears from overflowing

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:17.170
Samishiin janai kanashiin janai

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:17.170
It isn't lonely, it isn't sad

01:28:17.170 --> 01:28:22.360
Yuuki wo kureta kara nanda

01:28:17.170 --> 01:28:22.360
Because I've been given courage

01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:36.170
Tabidachi wo kimeta asa tomeru koto dekinakatta yo

01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:36.170
The morning you decided to set out, I couldn't do anything to stop you

01:28:36.170 --> 01:28:47.840
Michi no tsuzuki chigau keredo shinjiteru yo

01:28:36.170 --> 01:28:47.840
Though our paths have diverged, I believe in you

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:57.750
Daremo ga kodoku no kazu dake kokoro itame tsuke au darou

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:57.750
Anyone destined only for solitude is bound to have a heartache, it seems

01:28:57.750 --> 01:29:11.710
Kizuna wo wasurenaide

01:28:57.750 --> 01:29:11.710
I'll never forget our bonds

01:29:14.970 --> 01:29:16.860
What's this?

01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:18.210
This?

01:29:18.210 --> 01:29:19.660
It's a nakama mark.

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:20.770
Nakama?

01:29:20.770 --> 01:29:21.780
Yes.

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:24.560
The mark of very important nakama.

01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:30.740
Everyone, are you doing well?

01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.740
Right now, where are you traveling to?

01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:38.820
Sometimes I remember the memories of back then and come here.

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:42.000
Because, I...

01:29:42.730 --> 01:29:44.020
We...

01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:47.730
Will always be nakama!
