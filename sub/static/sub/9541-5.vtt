WEBVTT

00:06.533 --> 00:07.934
Broccoli head!

00:08.002 --> 00:11.437
You wanted to see me, sir?

00:12.840 --> 00:15.341
Deliver these packages
right away.

00:15.409 --> 00:18.945
Yes, Mr. Glubofunny.
Mr. Covighheim.

00:19.013 --> 00:20.813
Gabodaglophordia.

00:20.881 --> 00:22.682
How many times
I gotta tell you?

00:22.750 --> 00:24.517
Gabodaglophordia!

00:24.585 --> 00:28.688
Gablo...

00:31.759 --> 00:32.992
Huh?

00:33.060 --> 00:34.360
Bedtime, Arthur.

00:42.102 --> 00:43.303
Nighty night, Daphne.

00:43.370 --> 00:45.471
You're the bestest
babysitter ever.

00:45.539 --> 00:47.540
Mwah!

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.450 --> 00:58.151
Huh?

01:02.022 --> 01:03.056
That's odd.

01:03.123 --> 01:05.858
Who'd be playing a pan flute
at this hour?

01:11.565 --> 01:14.334
Arthur, are you all... Aah!

01:17.404 --> 01:19.005
Aah! Aah!

01:21.709 --> 01:23.476
Aah!

01:26.947 --> 01:28.915
Aah!

01:59.120 --> 02:09.288

02:15.262 --> 02:18.531
I just can't understand
what got into Arthur last night.

02:18.599 --> 02:20.366
One second he's
as sweet as can be,

02:20.434 --> 02:22.268
and the next,
he's trying to kill me.

02:22.336 --> 02:23.736
Maybe he had too much sugar.

02:23.804 --> 02:25.972
Sugar doesn't
make you grow fangs.

02:26.039 --> 02:27.140
Ha ha ha! Good!

02:27.207 --> 02:28.775
'Cause if there's
one thing I love,

02:28.842 --> 02:29.842
it's sugar.

02:29.910 --> 02:32.044
Me, too.

02:32.112 --> 02:33.846
Delicious!

02:33.914 --> 02:37.049
Like, you said it, Scoob.
Delicious.

02:37.117 --> 02:40.453
Shaggy, you promised me you weren't
going to use the word "like" so much.

02:40.521 --> 02:41.954
It makes you sound ignorant.

02:42.022 --> 02:43.389
- Oh.
- Oh, right.

02:43.457 --> 02:45.658
Like, um, I forgot.

02:46.693 --> 02:48.828
Ohh. Sorry.

02:48.896 --> 02:51.063
We're only a few blocks
from Arthur's house.

02:51.131 --> 02:52.732
Can we stop by
and see how he's doing?

02:52.800 --> 02:55.301
Sure. We're not gonna
miss anything at school.

02:55.369 --> 02:57.904
Oh, wait.
I forgot about civics class.

02:57.971 --> 02:59.172
I'm flunking out.

02:59.239 --> 03:01.574
Coach says if I don't pass,
I'm off the team.

03:01.642 --> 03:03.576
Hey, I'm great at civics.

03:03.644 --> 03:04.811
I could tutor you.

03:04.878 --> 03:08.247
I could come over and...
You know, help you study.

03:08.315 --> 03:09.916
Just you and me.

03:09.983 --> 03:11.584
Alone.

03:11.652 --> 03:12.718
Gee, Daph, thanks.

03:12.786 --> 03:14.353
But my dad already
hired a tutor.

03:14.421 --> 03:16.823
I'm supposed to meet her
in the library during lunch.

03:16.890 --> 03:18.658
- Her?
- Yeah, a senior.

03:18.725 --> 03:21.327
Dad said she's brilliant.

03:22.262 --> 03:24.664
Whoa, look at this.

03:35.008 --> 03:36.943
Like, where's everyone going?

03:37.010 --> 03:38.911
Oops. Sorry.

03:40.214 --> 03:42.114
Wait!

03:42.182 --> 03:45.051
Mr. and Mrs. Baywoosenthal,
what's going on?

03:45.118 --> 03:46.486
How's Arthur?

03:48.522 --> 03:49.822
Any other questions?

03:49.890 --> 03:51.791
Jinkies!
The whole block's leaving.

03:51.859 --> 03:53.226
And a good thing, too.

03:53.293 --> 03:55.495
Who knows what these kids
are capable of?

03:55.562 --> 03:57.230
Kids? You mean...

03:57.297 --> 03:58.297
Afraid so.

03:58.365 --> 03:59.932
Every child on this block

04:00.000 --> 04:04.637
has become inexplicably
spookified.

04:04.705 --> 04:06.639
Spookified?!

04:07.808 --> 04:09.742
- Good-bye, Tiffany.

04:11.245 --> 04:12.678
Ok.

04:12.746 --> 04:14.647
Don't forget to brush.

04:14.715 --> 04:16.781
They can't just leave
all the kids.

04:16.850 --> 04:18.317
They'll be fine.

04:18.385 --> 04:20.653
We'll air drop in
some freeze-dried camp food.

04:20.721 --> 04:22.522
Just 'cause they're spookified

04:22.589 --> 04:25.157
doesn't mean they can't
reconstitute macaroni.

04:25.225 --> 04:26.893
Any idea what caused this,
sheriff?

04:26.960 --> 04:28.561
We're not really sure,

04:28.629 --> 04:32.098
but it may have something
to do with this.

04:32.165 --> 04:33.833
Isn't that creepy?

04:33.901 --> 04:35.968
Ha ha.
Like, I'll say.

04:36.036 --> 04:38.538
Ouch! You're bruising
my kidney.

04:38.605 --> 04:40.573
This thing shows up,
plays its creepy flute,

04:40.641 --> 04:42.808
and all the kids are all...

04:42.876 --> 04:44.377
Spookified!

04:44.444 --> 04:48.681
Well, gang, looks like we've got
another mystery on our hands.

04:49.650 --> 04:50.650
But, dad.

04:50.717 --> 04:53.986
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, uh-uh.

04:54.054 --> 04:55.655
Absolutely no mystery solving.

04:55.722 --> 04:58.457
We've got one heck
of a monster here.

04:58.525 --> 05:03.062
I smell tourists, t-shirts,
concerts, tchotchkes.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.196
In.

05:04.264 --> 05:06.032
But, dad, we can help.

05:06.099 --> 05:09.602
You can help
by not flunking civics.

05:09.670 --> 05:11.270
I'll drive you back to school.

05:16.310 --> 05:17.577
Time for dessert.

05:17.644 --> 05:19.979
Like, mind bringing me
back some, too?

05:20.047 --> 05:22.214
Okie dokie.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.585
Oops. I said "like" again,
didn't I?

05:25.652 --> 05:27.219
Oh, boy, I'm sorry.

05:27.287 --> 05:28.487
I just can't help it.

05:28.555 --> 05:30.957
Here. Put this rubber band
around your wrist.

05:31.024 --> 05:32.592
Every time you say
the word like,

05:32.659 --> 05:33.626
snap it.

05:33.694 --> 05:34.894
Hard.

05:34.962 --> 05:36.829
Um, but that will hurt.

05:36.897 --> 05:38.931
That's the point.

05:38.999 --> 05:41.167
Here, pick out
a new pair of pants.

05:41.234 --> 05:43.235
What's wrong with my pants?

05:43.303 --> 05:46.439
You promised me you were going to start
caring more about your appearance.

05:46.506 --> 05:47.907
But I like these pants.

05:47.975 --> 05:49.809
You've worn them
since the eighth grade.

05:49.876 --> 05:51.577
They're comfortable pants.

05:51.645 --> 05:53.312
Fine.

05:53.380 --> 05:56.082
I'll pick them out
for you myself.

05:56.149 --> 05:57.917
Like, what is wrong with her?

05:57.985 --> 05:59.552
Oops.

06:01.221 --> 06:02.688
Ow!

06:04.558 --> 06:06.225
I wonder which one is my tutor.

06:06.293 --> 06:07.360
Me, too.

06:07.427 --> 06:09.261
- Fred Jones, Jr.
- Huh?

06:09.329 --> 06:11.364
Down here.

06:11.431 --> 06:13.666
I'm Mary Anne Geerdon,
your tutor.

06:13.734 --> 06:15.101
You?

06:15.168 --> 06:17.103
You're the brilliant senior?

06:17.170 --> 06:19.005
I have an IQ of 195.

06:19.072 --> 06:20.806
I should actually
be in college,

06:20.874 --> 06:23.409
but my parents want me to spend
a few weeks in high school

06:23.477 --> 06:25.311
to help develop social skills.

06:26.947 --> 06:28.714
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

06:28.782 --> 06:30.182
So you're pretty good
at civics, huh?

06:30.250 --> 06:31.617
It's my passion.

06:31.685 --> 06:33.886
That's how I met your father,
the Mayor.

06:33.954 --> 06:36.122
I asked to be appointed
to the city council.

06:36.189 --> 06:39.859
I have some brilliant ideas on how
to run the city more efficiently.

06:39.926 --> 06:42.061
He said I was too young.

06:43.597 --> 06:45.498
Come, Fredrick.
We have a lot of work to do.

06:45.565 --> 06:46.666
Oh!

06:46.733 --> 06:48.501
Have a good time, Fredrick.

06:48.568 --> 06:49.635
I'm so sorry!

06:49.703 --> 06:51.203
No, it's my fault.

06:51.271 --> 06:52.972
I was not looking
where my eyes were going.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.241
You're that new
exchange teacher.

06:55.308 --> 06:57.610
Yes,
Dr. Louis De Portillo.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.078
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:59.146 --> 07:03.816
I must prepare my lecture on South
American indigent mythology.

07:03.884 --> 07:07.653
Oh. Dr. Portillo!
Your book.

07:10.590 --> 07:11.791
That is none of your business.

07:14.895 --> 07:16.996
Hmm.

07:32.179 --> 07:35.214
It's happening again!

07:48.949 --> 07:52.084
Looks like the creepy flute
player struck again last night.

07:56.156 --> 07:57.623
How do you like your new pants?

07:57.691 --> 08:00.126
Um, they're a little tight.

08:00.193 --> 08:01.827
That's the style.

08:01.895 --> 08:03.095
You look great.

08:03.163 --> 08:05.231
I sort of feel like a sausage.

08:06.433 --> 08:08.400
More parents are leaving.

08:09.402 --> 08:11.036
At this rate,
crystal cove will be

08:11.104 --> 08:13.105
a town of nothing
but spookified kids.

08:13.173 --> 08:15.541
Hey, what's with the pets?

08:19.779 --> 08:23.149
This is the location
of the most recent attack

08:23.216 --> 08:25.384
by the creature
that's been spookifying

08:25.452 --> 08:26.652
the children of crystal cove.

08:28.889 --> 08:31.857
Velma, sweetheart, how are you?

08:31.925 --> 08:33.626
Sheriff, they're back!

08:33.693 --> 08:35.727
Mom, please.

08:35.794 --> 08:37.730
We just wanted to see
what was happening.

08:37.797 --> 08:39.198
There's nothing to see.

08:39.265 --> 08:41.033
Not unless you're paying.

08:41.101 --> 08:42.934
Now, get to school, darling.

08:43.003 --> 08:45.337
All of you!

08:45.405 --> 08:46.572
Be an angel
and take one of these

08:46.640 --> 08:47.806
and wear it around school.

08:47.874 --> 08:51.677
Oh, and if anyone asks,
they're $15.

08:51.745 --> 08:53.913
We've got to find out
what this thing is

08:53.980 --> 08:55.181
and where it comes from.

08:55.248 --> 08:57.516
And I think I know
who can help.

09:00.253 --> 09:02.655
- Hey, how much is...
- 15.

09:02.722 --> 09:04.456
Dr. Portillo?

09:04.524 --> 09:07.326
Hmm. He must be
teaching a class.

09:07.394 --> 09:09.595
Like, what kind of stuff
does this dude teach anyway?

09:09.663 --> 09:12.565
Oops!

09:12.632 --> 09:14.466
Ow!

09:18.338 --> 09:20.206
What are you doing
in my office,

09:20.273 --> 09:21.574
a personal, private space?

09:21.641 --> 09:24.043
Dr. Portillo, it's important
that we talk to you.

09:24.110 --> 09:26.045
Do you recognize this creature?

09:28.481 --> 09:30.549
Yes.

09:31.918 --> 09:35.154
It is Que horrifico.

09:35.222 --> 09:37.323
Who's Que horrifico?

09:37.390 --> 09:39.058
A mythological creature.

09:39.125 --> 09:41.060
Hey, cool blowgun.

09:41.127 --> 09:42.328
What size dart do you use?

09:42.395 --> 09:44.863
I prefer a 3 centimeter
with combed beaver bristles.

09:44.931 --> 09:48.467
Fred, that's not a blowgun.
It's a pan flute.

09:48.535 --> 09:51.370
So you are saying
because I have a pan flute

09:51.438 --> 09:52.838
I am the creature?
Oh, ho ho ho.

09:52.906 --> 09:55.774
This pan flute is purely for
recreational purposes, I assure you.

09:55.842 --> 09:57.810
Oh, how dare you accuse me?

09:57.877 --> 10:01.747
No one's accusing you
of anything.

10:01.815 --> 10:03.916
Just want to find out
about this thing.

10:05.352 --> 10:07.086
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

10:07.153 --> 10:09.588
Where are my manners?
Yes, of course I can help you.

10:09.656 --> 10:12.591
I gave a lecture on Que horrifico
to my honors class a few weeks ago.

10:12.659 --> 10:15.561
I'll get the slides.
They're in color!

10:15.629 --> 10:20.065
The peoples have long told
the tale of Que horrifico.

10:20.133 --> 10:21.734
A normal man by day,

10:21.801 --> 10:23.736
but every night at sundown,

10:23.803 --> 10:26.505
he changes into Que horrifico.

10:26.573 --> 10:28.374
He roams through the villages

10:28.441 --> 10:30.976
and plays his song
of mystery on a pan flute,

10:31.044 --> 10:33.779
turning the children
into terriblados!

10:35.915 --> 10:38.684
In America we call it
getting spookified.

10:38.752 --> 10:40.352
That's good to know.
Thank you.

10:40.420 --> 10:43.422
The childrens become
his servants of evil.

10:43.490 --> 10:45.791
Eventually he takes them
to his spooky town

10:45.859 --> 10:47.393
or cave or something.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.728
There's a lot of debate on that.
Who can say?

10:49.796 --> 10:51.797
Well, that's really all I know.

10:54.234 --> 10:56.635
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going home to rest.

10:56.703 --> 11:00.105
I haven't slept ll
these last 2 nights.

11:01.508 --> 11:03.709
Gang, I know this
sounds crazy, but...

11:03.777 --> 11:05.878
- hey, how much is...
- 15.

11:05.945 --> 11:08.447
But what is Dr. Portillo
is Que horrifico?

11:08.515 --> 11:10.516
He has the pan flute,
the blankets.

11:10.583 --> 11:13.218
He said he hasn't been
sleeping well the past 2 nights.

11:13.286 --> 11:15.287
And he has an accent.

11:15.355 --> 11:17.856
I say we keep a close eye
on Dr. Portillo.

11:17.924 --> 11:19.224
Fred Jones, Jr.

11:19.292 --> 11:21.327
You were supposed to
meet me in the library

11:21.394 --> 11:23.095
for your civics tutoring.

11:25.031 --> 11:26.565
Mary Anne, I can't.

11:26.633 --> 11:28.600
I have something important
I need to do.

11:28.668 --> 11:31.970
What could possibly
be more important

11:32.038 --> 11:34.340
than civics?

11:35.775 --> 11:37.409
That's Portillo's house.

11:37.477 --> 11:39.378
I got the address
off the school computer.

11:39.446 --> 11:41.980
Ok, gang, come on.

11:51.925 --> 11:54.827
Wait up!
I can't sneak in these pants.

11:59.532 --> 12:00.599
Is he in there?

12:00.667 --> 12:03.068
Shaggy, get down.
He'll see you.

12:03.136 --> 12:04.903
My legs won't bend.

12:04.971 --> 12:06.405
Down!

12:07.874 --> 12:10.976
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

12:11.044 --> 12:15.180
So, you do think
I am Que horrifico!

12:15.248 --> 12:18.984
Well, I am beginning to agree.

12:19.052 --> 12:21.120
Perhaps you can help.

12:22.288 --> 12:24.556
Wow, these chains
are fantastic.

12:24.624 --> 12:26.592
Who's your chain guy?
I want his number.

12:26.659 --> 12:28.794
Wouldn't you know
if you were Que horrifico?

12:28.862 --> 12:31.463
The transformation
may be so totally complete

12:31.531 --> 12:33.532
that I don't remember it
the next day.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.634
Like after you've had
too much fudge.

12:36.936 --> 12:38.670
The moon is up.

12:38.738 --> 12:39.705
Now what?

12:39.773 --> 12:40.973
We wait.

12:57.657 --> 13:00.659
Delivery for Mrs. [babbles].

13:00.727 --> 13:04.329
No, no.
It's bobbenconiblplatz.

13:14.707 --> 13:15.641
Oh, no!

13:15.708 --> 13:17.576
I think... I think
it's happening.

13:17.644 --> 13:19.545
Oh, no!
It's happening!

13:19.612 --> 13:20.612
It's happening!

13:20.680 --> 13:21.980
Aye! Here it comes!

13:22.048 --> 13:24.950
I'm so scared!
Oh! I'm so scared!

13:25.018 --> 13:26.318
Here it comes!

13:28.388 --> 13:29.955
No, it's just gas.

13:42.936 --> 13:45.871
It's Que horrifico!
He's back!

13:49.375 --> 13:51.610
Well, at least we know
it's not Dr. Portillo.

13:51.678 --> 13:54.813
- I am not the weirdo?
Whoop-Dee-Doo! Yay for me!

13:54.881 --> 13:56.582
We're gonna catch that thing.

13:56.649 --> 13:58.884
Like, how do you know that?

14:01.254 --> 14:04.389
Because I'm gonna build a trip.

14:08.654 --> 14:09.588
Jinkies!

14:09.655 --> 14:12.557
Kids have taken over
crystal cove.

14:14.427 --> 14:18.096
Yeah, like, this whole
neighborhood's been spookified.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.000
Yeah, but not this house.

14:22.068 --> 14:23.769
It's been for rent for a year.

14:26.472 --> 14:28.874
- A fully furnished,
3-bedroom, 2-bath charmer

14:28.941 --> 14:31.076
with upgraded appliances.

14:31.144 --> 14:33.445
Perfect for a couple
just starting out.

14:33.513 --> 14:35.380
Not when I'm done with it.

14:35.448 --> 14:39.184
But why would
Que horrifico come here?

14:39.252 --> 14:40.685
He wouldn't.

14:40.753 --> 14:42.921
Unless there was a new family
with kids moving in.

14:42.989 --> 14:45.624
But who'd be dumb enough
to do that?

14:45.691 --> 14:49.094
Oh, my. Don't our
2 young children

14:49.162 --> 14:51.563
seem to be having
a wonderful time?

14:51.631 --> 14:53.598
Ugh. How humiliating.

14:53.666 --> 14:56.201
At least I'm out of
those tight pants.

14:58.104 --> 15:00.806
This is nice.

15:00.873 --> 15:01.907
Watch it, Daphne.

15:01.974 --> 15:04.076
Remember, we're married.
Don't look so happy.

15:04.143 --> 15:05.410
It's almost sunset.

15:05.478 --> 15:06.545
You better get inside.

15:06.612 --> 15:08.013
Right.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.514
Come, 2 young children.

15:09.582 --> 15:10.849
It's bedtime.

15:10.917 --> 15:13.185
Grandma's gonna tell you
a story.

15:13.252 --> 15:14.786
Oh, goody!

15:26.899 --> 15:28.366
Quick, get upstairs.

15:36.309 --> 15:39.311
Aren't you gonna
tell us a story?

15:40.813 --> 15:42.180
Yes. The end.

15:42.248 --> 15:43.949
Now, shh.

15:45.551 --> 15:48.386
Like, I don't want
to be spookified.

15:48.454 --> 15:49.921
Ow!

15:49.989 --> 15:50.989
Thanks, Scoob.

15:51.057 --> 15:52.824
You're welcome, Shaggy.

15:57.230 --> 15:58.230
There it is.

15:58.297 --> 16:01.266
Come on. Come on,
just a little closer.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.936
Say hello to Mr. trap!

16:08.941 --> 16:11.543
Ha ha!
Got him!

16:25.224 --> 16:27.058
This town's ours now.

16:27.126 --> 16:28.627
Get them!

16:49.215 --> 16:50.582
Uhh!

16:58.391 --> 16:59.558
Aah!

16:59.625 --> 17:00.792
Aah!

17:07.733 --> 17:09.034
Aah!

17:15.308 --> 17:17.375
Ohh!

17:18.377 --> 17:19.978
Ohh!

17:20.046 --> 17:22.113
Aah!

17:22.949 --> 17:25.416
Aah!

17:28.654 --> 17:31.356
Ohh!

17:31.424 --> 17:33.925
Whoa!

17:46.639 --> 17:49.307
Aah!

18:06.592 --> 18:08.393
Daphne, Velma, over here.

18:08.461 --> 18:09.628
Get behind me.

18:20.873 --> 18:23.808
I never thought
it would end this way.

18:23.876 --> 18:25.176
Good-bye, Scooby-Doo.

18:25.244 --> 18:26.878
- Good-bye, Shaggy.

18:26.946 --> 18:28.980
You were a dog's best friend.

18:33.452 --> 18:37.455
Delivery for
Mrs. [babbles]

18:37.523 --> 18:39.291
No, no, no.

18:42.194 --> 18:45.664
Open your grotesque ears,
you ignorant freak.

18:47.300 --> 18:52.037
Now, I'm going to say it
once again very, very slowly.

18:52.104 --> 18:54.439
It's gabodaglophordia!

18:59.011 --> 19:00.445
What are you doing?

19:00.513 --> 19:02.614
Attack them!

19:02.682 --> 19:05.483
In a minute.
We want to watch this.

19:06.585 --> 19:09.421
Fools!
You'll ruining everything.

19:09.488 --> 19:11.556
Get him, gang.

19:12.758 --> 19:14.159
Uhh!

19:15.161 --> 19:16.127
Uhh!

19:20.099 --> 19:21.366
Aah!

19:21.434 --> 19:22.567
Uhh!

19:22.635 --> 19:24.869
What in the name of
whole wheat toast is going on?

19:24.937 --> 19:26.304
We got him, dad.

19:26.372 --> 19:28.473
You mean her.

19:28.541 --> 19:30.608
Mary Anne Geerdon!

19:30.676 --> 19:32.644
Your tutor?
But why?

19:32.712 --> 19:35.413
Was trying to scare all the
adults out of crystal cove

19:35.481 --> 19:37.382
so I could run the city my way.

19:39.318 --> 19:41.853
I told you,
I have brilliant ideas.

19:41.921 --> 19:43.088
With all the adults gone,

19:43.155 --> 19:45.657
there's be no one
to stand in my way.

19:45.725 --> 19:48.393
I learned about the legend
of Que horrifico

19:48.461 --> 19:50.662
in Dr. Portillo's
honors class.

19:50.730 --> 19:52.697
It was the perfect solution.

19:52.765 --> 19:54.866
I used the high school's
theater department

19:54.934 --> 19:56.468
for my costume.

19:56.535 --> 20:00.205
I went to every kindergarten and
elementary school in the city

20:00.272 --> 20:03.308
to convince the children
to pretend to be spookified.

20:03.376 --> 20:07.212
In return,
I offered them utopia.

20:08.347 --> 20:11.082
When that didn't work,
I offered them candy.

20:12.385 --> 20:14.853
Whenever the children
heard me playing the pan flute,

20:14.920 --> 20:17.655
that was their signal to put on
their fake hair and fangs

20:17.723 --> 20:19.491
and commence spookification.

20:19.558 --> 20:22.160
I almost had the whole town
cleared of adults.

20:22.228 --> 20:26.030
I would have, too, if it
weren't for you...

20:26.098 --> 20:27.198
Huh?

20:28.601 --> 20:31.302
Loosely translated it means
"meddlesome kids" in Latin.

20:31.370 --> 20:32.837
I'm going home.

20:32.905 --> 20:34.205
I miss my mom and dad.

20:34.273 --> 20:36.207
- Bye.
- See ya.

20:36.275 --> 20:38.410
By the way, this was lame.

20:40.346 --> 20:41.946
Wait, you're taking me to jail?

20:42.014 --> 20:43.348
But I'm just a kid.

20:43.416 --> 20:46.184
Do you know how many
boxes we're stuck with

20:46.252 --> 20:49.821
of Que horrifico t-shirts,
Que horrifico pamphlets,

20:49.889 --> 20:52.424
Que horrifico dance CDs,
Que horrifico...

20:52.491 --> 20:54.759
Ok, OK, I see your point.

20:58.030 --> 20:59.998
Congratulations, babies.

21:00.065 --> 21:02.100
Another mystery solved.

21:02.168 --> 21:03.802
Ooh.

21:08.073 --> 21:09.941
- Ahh!
- Got you, Scoob.

21:10.009 --> 21:12.210
I'm not scared of you.

21:12.278 --> 21:14.946
I'm scared of him.

21:16.882 --> 21:18.716
Que horrifico!

21:18.784 --> 21:19.984
He's back!

21:20.052 --> 21:21.820
No, it's just me.

21:21.887 --> 21:25.390
I have come to thank you
with a pan flute concert.

21:32.798 --> 21:35.633
Velma, I want you
to take these back.

21:35.701 --> 21:37.235
But...

21:37.303 --> 21:39.237
It's time you knew.

21:39.305 --> 21:42.907
Shaggy likes baggy.
