00:32.916 --> 00:37.361
Can you hear that?
Sounds like another hit.

00:37.396 --> 00:40.346
What? What?

00:40.975 --> 00:45.309
Well, you can't really
appreciate it over the phone.

00:45.344 --> 00:48.577
No, Chloe, darling,
we can't re-record it.

00:48.612 --> 00:52.450
We're already four
months behind schedule.

00:52.485 --> 00:56.075
Trust me.
Trust my gut, it's golden.

00:56.110 --> 00:57.667
Even Darwin loves it.

00:57.702 --> 01:00.074
He's been dancing around
the house all night.

01:00.109 --> 01:04.647
It's mommy.
Tell her how much you love her.

01:05.363 --> 01:08.582
He can't talk right now.
He's busy.

01:09.211 --> 01:14.808
Look, I love you, too.
All right.

01:20.752 --> 01:23.248
So...

01:29.572 --> 01:34.365
Nice. Slow fade.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.620
You know, everything fades, Darwin.

01:36.655 --> 01:42.506
Songs fade.
Love fades.

01:42.541 --> 01:49.337
Happiness fades.
Idea for album cover...

01:58.148 --> 02:00.795
It's okay, Darwin.
Come on. Don't be scared.

02:00.830 --> 02:05.252
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Darwin. Come on.

02:05.287 --> 02:07.303
Let's go to the panic room.
We'll be okay.

02:07.338 --> 02:10.144
Come on, Darwin.
Come on. It's okay, buddy.

02:10.179 --> 02:13.019
Come on. It's okay.
It's okay.

02:13.054 --> 02:15.925
It's okay.
It's okay.

02:15.980 --> 02:19.183
It's okay.
We're safe in here.

02:26.856 --> 02:30.421
Mr. Blackburn, are you in here?

02:30.456 --> 02:33.059
Hello, sir, We're the police!

02:33.094 --> 02:36.845
- Is there an intercom or something?
- I don't see one.

02:57.995 --> 03:00.904
Should I read him his rights?

03:08.162 --> 03:10.331
MONK Season 3 Epi. 02
Mr. Monk and the Panic Room

04:21.872 --> 04:24.063
Benjy, I am so disappointed in you,

04:24.098 --> 04:25.777
and you were lucky.
you weren't expelled.

04:25.812 --> 04:27.281
- Uh-oh.
- What?

04:27.316 --> 04:29.283
- Oh, the band-aid is...
- It's okay.

04:29.318 --> 04:31.624
It doesn't have to be perfect. Ow!

04:31.659 --> 04:33.736
You'll heal faster
if it's straighter.

04:33.771 --> 04:37.552
- Mom, can you please do this?
- You don't want me near you,

04:37.587 --> 04:39.180
and it serves you right for fighting.

04:39.215 --> 04:41.656
I wasn't fighting. You said
I should defend myself.

04:41.691 --> 04:43.148
You weren't defending yourself.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.676
You were defending that little boy,
and you know it.

04:45.711 --> 04:48.468
His name is Reuben.
Everyone was picking on him.

04:48.503 --> 04:51.223
- They were giving him a wedgie.
- What's a wedgie?

04:51.258 --> 04:53.804
It's when they lift your underwear
all the way out of your pants.

04:53.839 --> 04:56.142
Oh. When I was a kid,
they called it something else.

04:56.177 --> 04:58.346
- What?
- An Adrian.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.597
I feel sorry for Reuben, too.
I really do.

05:00.632 --> 05:03.189
But he's not your problem, and you
should have gone to another teacher.

05:03.224 --> 05:07.077
Teachers don't do anything.
He gets picked on every day.

05:07.112 --> 05:10.100
- He's too little to fight back.
- Benjy, rules are rules.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.918
Now, you're punished,
and there's no TV,

05:12.953 --> 05:14.606
- and there's no playstation.
- Mom.

05:14.641 --> 05:17.697
Sharona, he was just
sticking up for a friend.

05:17.732 --> 05:20.793
Adrian, you stay out of it.
You're not his father.

05:20.828 --> 05:23.894
That's true, but I care about
him as much as any father.

05:23.929 --> 05:28.080
Ow! Stop it!

05:31.392 --> 05:36.017
Hello? Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he's here. Uh-huh.

05:36.595 --> 05:42.855
Oh, okay. Yeah.
Uh, 715 vinton street. Okay, great.

05:42.890 --> 05:47.122
Yeah, we'll be there.
Okay, bye.

05:47.157 --> 05:50.717
Adrian, we have a job.
We got to go.

05:51.904 --> 05:56.107
What...
please look at me.

05:56.142 --> 05:58.360
Benjy, I'm going to call aunt Gail,

05:58.395 --> 06:01.121
and she's going to make you
dinner tonight, okay? - Yeah.

06:01.156 --> 06:09.056
Now, I want you to go to your room
and think about what you've done. - Yep.

06:09.652 --> 06:12.788
You know I still love you, right?

06:12.823 --> 06:16.308
All right. Go to your room.

06:35.664 --> 06:38.338
- Monk. Sharona.
- Lieutenant.

06:38.373 --> 06:40.027
Thank you for coming.

06:40.062 --> 06:44.154
We've got a very bizarre situation here.
I could use a second opinion.

06:44.189 --> 06:46.057
- Third opinion.
- What?

06:46.092 --> 06:49.010
Well, I already told you what I thought,
so this would be a third opinion.

06:49.045 --> 06:52.295
Whatever.
A third opinion.

06:52.330 --> 06:54.595
- Who's the victim?
- Ian Blackburn.

06:54.630 --> 06:57.425
He's a major-league record producer,
and he's worked with everybody.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.767
The Stones, Springsteen,
The Eagles. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:59.802 --> 07:01.045
Isn't he married to Chloe?

07:01.080 --> 07:03.121
Yeah, yeah, they've been
married for two years.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.065
He produces all of her stuff.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.183
At least he did until 5:09 this morning.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.560
Who's Chloe?

07:12.674 --> 07:17.240
Well, she's the most famous
singer on the planet.

07:17.275 --> 07:21.554
Oh, Chloe.
Yeah, sure. She's great.

07:21.589 --> 07:27.370
I love that song she does about...
loving that guy, 'cause...

07:27.405 --> 07:30.832
look, the press hasn't gotten wind of this
yet, but it won't be long.

07:30.867 --> 07:35.319
Captain? You wanted to see
the window? - Yes, sir.

07:35.354 --> 07:38.144
- He got in through here?
- No, he never got in.

07:38.179 --> 07:41.341
He broke the glass, set off the alarm,
and that scared him away.

07:41.376 --> 07:43.813
Probably just some
neighborhood kid. - Yep.

07:43.848 --> 07:47.317
- That is strange.
- What's strange?

07:47.352 --> 07:51.817
These footprints heading toward the house,
you see the whole foot.

07:51.852 --> 07:55.066
- He's walking.
- So?

07:55.101 --> 08:02.115
Look at these heading the other way.
You see the whole foot. Still walking.

08:02.150 --> 08:05.050
If somebody tripped an alarm,
especially a kid,

08:05.085 --> 08:07.481
you'd think they'd run away.

08:07.516 --> 08:09.672
You might be right,
but it doesn't matter,

08:09.707 --> 08:13.257
because whoever broke that glass
never got into the house.

08:13.292 --> 08:16.345
- He's not the killer.
- Then who is?

08:16.380 --> 08:18.806
- Do you have a suspect?
- Yep.

08:18.841 --> 08:21.213
You want to meet him?

08:32.768 --> 08:36.063
It's a monkey.

08:36.785 --> 08:41.846
Actually, uh, he's a chimpanzee.
His name's Darwin. He's 5 years old.

08:41.881 --> 08:44.995
He's been living with Mr. Blackburn
since he was a baby.

08:45.030 --> 08:50.555
I mean a baby chimp.
He was never a regular baby.

08:50.590 --> 08:57.418
- I don't understand.
- He's our suspect. He's the shooter.

08:59.214 --> 09:00.831
I don't understand.

09:00.866 --> 09:05.389
That chimp was alone in a
locked room with the victim.

09:05.424 --> 09:10.206
We found a gun in his hand.

09:12.194 --> 09:15.044
I don't understand.

09:15.079 --> 09:18.127
Oh, he's scared to death.
Come on, baby.

09:18.162 --> 09:19.992
Sharona, don't touch him.
Don't touch it.

09:20.027 --> 09:24.346
Don't, now you're going,
you're going to have to be quarantined,

09:24.381 --> 09:28.127
and you will, too.
You all will.

09:28.162 --> 09:30.433
I think he's hungry.
Has anybody fed him?

09:30.468 --> 09:33.420
We called animal control.
They'll be here soon.

09:33.455 --> 09:36.409
- Is there a kitchen around here?
- Yeah, in there.

09:36.444 --> 09:39.390
- I'll go with you.
- Why?

09:39.425 --> 09:42.641
He's dangerous, Sharona.
He's killed before.

09:42.676 --> 09:45.577
Oh, please. He wouldn't
hurt a fly. Look at him.

09:45.612 --> 09:49.769
Come on, honey.
Come on.

09:49.804 --> 09:52.182
This is his own private
recording studio.

09:52.217 --> 09:57.058
48 tracks, all-digital.
State of the art.

09:57.093 --> 10:00.826
- Is that the wife?
- Yep, Chloe.

10:00.861 --> 10:03.621
She's state of the art, too.
I just talked to her.

10:03.656 --> 10:06.419
She was in Dallas
doing a show last night.

10:06.454 --> 10:10.067
- How did she take the news?
- Shock, tears.

10:10.102 --> 10:14.661
- It sounded genuine.
- Whoa, whoa.

10:16.197 --> 10:18.108
Um...

10:18.143 --> 10:22.518
She's canceling her tour. She's flying
back here. She'll be here later today.

10:22.553 --> 10:25.962
She told me she spoke
to Ian at around 4:00 A. M.

10:25.997 --> 10:30.509
He was in here mixing a song.
Monk.

10:31.080 --> 10:36.030
And, uh, at 5:09, somebody
broke the window downstairs.

10:36.065 --> 10:40.267
- Which, which set off the alarm.
- Right. - Right.

10:40.302 --> 10:41.335
At which point Blackburn
grabbed the monkey,

10:41.370 --> 10:43.477
and they skedaddled down
that hall toward the bedroom.

10:43.512 --> 10:47.409
- Monk, stop it.
- What is that?

10:47.444 --> 10:51.790
- Do you, do you hear that?
- What? - Listen.

11:03.717 --> 11:06.469
It's a pill dispenser.

11:06.504 --> 11:10.773
Oh, yeah, she said that
he was on antidepressants.

11:10.808 --> 11:13.350
Karen's got one of those.
It's got a built-in alarm in it.

11:13.385 --> 11:14.933
It reminds her when to take the pills.

11:14.968 --> 11:20.400
This one's set for 4:30 A. M.,
But you said the alarm went off at 5:09.

11:20.435 --> 11:24.452
- So why didn't he take his pills?
- Why didn't he take his pills?

11:25.365 --> 11:27.700
- That's pretty weird.
- Hang on.

11:27.735 --> 11:31.080
It gets weirder.
Come on.

11:33.934 --> 11:35.708
Come on, honey.

11:35.743 --> 11:41.838
Feel better?
Do you feel better? Okay.

11:41.873 --> 11:44.857
What happened last night?

11:46.538 --> 11:48.844
Guess he's not going
to be the best witness.

11:48.879 --> 11:52.996
He's not a witness, Sharona.
He's the killer. Whoa.

11:53.031 --> 11:57.270
Hey, watch it.
He did it.

11:57.305 --> 12:00.516
We'll see what Adrian says.
He's very smart.

12:00.551 --> 12:03.362
He's going to figure it all out.

12:03.397 --> 12:05.120
They call it a panic room.

12:05.155 --> 12:06.575
I know that's a difficult concept,

12:06.610 --> 12:09.957
because for you, every room is
a panic room. - Thank you.

12:09.992 --> 12:12.367
If there's an intruder in the house,
you run in there, you lock the door,

12:12.402 --> 12:14.944
- and wait for the cavalry.
- Which is what Blackburn did.

12:14.979 --> 12:16.948
Exactly. The alarm came in at 5:09,

12:16.983 --> 12:19.334
two uniforms responded,
no sign of an intruder.

12:19.369 --> 12:23.294
They run upstairs, knock, knock,
door's locked, no answer.

12:23.329 --> 12:26.426
They cut their way in.

12:26.461 --> 12:28.782
They find him right there,
shot four times.

12:28.817 --> 12:32.172
Once in the chest, once in the head,
twice in the back.

12:32.207 --> 12:37.885
King kong is right there next to him,
covered with blood, with a gun in his hand.

12:38.843 --> 12:45.225
- And the room was locked from the inside?
- Oh, yeah, locked and bolted.

12:45.260 --> 12:47.500
As you can see, it's
completely self-contained.

12:47.535 --> 12:50.484
You could live in here for a week.

12:50.519 --> 12:53.999
Well, not you, but a person could.

13:03.957 --> 13:09.579
- Who owned the gun?
- He did. He kept it in here.

13:11.645 --> 13:15.682
So what do you think?
I mean, am I missing anything?

13:15.717 --> 13:18.952
Because I, I want to be sure
before I go on television and

13:18.987 --> 13:22.906
- utter the words "killer monkey."
- Mm.

13:24.288 --> 13:26.862
I don't know.

13:28.034 --> 13:30.868
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

13:30.903 --> 13:34.967
Help! Somebody!
Oh, my...

13:35.002 --> 13:38.216
I'm trapped in here.
I'm trapped in here!

13:38.251 --> 13:41.176
- Monk, you're not trapped.
- Captain!

13:41.211 --> 13:42.969
Monk, just push this button
here on the wall.

13:43.004 --> 13:45.276
It's sound proof.
Can you hear me?

13:45.311 --> 13:48.104
- Monk, I can hear you.
- I'm trapped in here!

13:48.139 --> 13:49.674
Monk, I can hear you.
I can see you.

13:49.709 --> 13:52.719
- There's a hole in the door. Monk.
- I'm running out of air.

13:52.754 --> 13:55.321
No, you're not running out
of air, Monk. Monk.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.527
- I'm running out of air!
- You're not running out of air.

13:57.562 --> 13:58.610
- There's a...
- I can't breathe!

13:58.645 --> 14:02.354
- Monk. Monk!
- I can't breathe!

14:02.389 --> 14:05.867
Monk, you can breathe.
There's a hole in the door.

14:05.902 --> 14:07.861
No more talking.

14:07.896 --> 14:10.098
Monk, look at me.
Monk, push the button.

14:10.133 --> 14:12.382
No more talking!

14:12.417 --> 14:15.752
Monk, look at me! Monk.

14:15.787 --> 14:19.544
Help me!
Got to conserve air.

14:19.579 --> 14:20.962
Monk, just push the button.

14:20.997 --> 14:23.885
Push, push,
push the green button.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.418
Monk.

14:26.453 --> 14:28.963
The green button
that says "open."

14:28.998 --> 14:35.023
No, the button here that
says "open" by the door. Monk.

14:43.529 --> 14:46.118
That's a panic room.

14:46.153 --> 14:49.908
- Adrian, are you all right?
- I almost ran out of air.

14:49.943 --> 14:53.278
Well, at least you didn't lose your head,
and that's the important thing.

14:53.313 --> 14:57.287
Excuse me.
We're from animal control.

15:04.802 --> 15:06.884
Please, darling, come here.
Oh, shh, shh.

15:06.919 --> 15:08.669
Here you go, fella.
You got to come with us now.

15:08.704 --> 15:11.104
- That's a good boy.
- No, what are you going to do with him?

15:11.139 --> 15:13.168
If he killed somebody, we're
going to have to put him down.

15:13.203 --> 15:18.989
- You're going to put him down?
- I'm afraid so. That's the law. - What?

15:19.024 --> 15:21.450
Adrian, you have to do something.
He didn't do it.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.746
Sharona, the room was locked.
There was nobody else in there.

15:23.781 --> 15:27.862
I don't care! He didn't do it!
I, he didn't do it.

15:27.897 --> 15:31.429
I know he didn't do it.

15:36.830 --> 15:40.041
You like that?
You miss me? Huh?

15:40.076 --> 15:44.134
- I missed you.
- So how long have you two been dating?

15:44.169 --> 15:46.431
He's just jealous 'cause
you're cuter than him,

15:46.466 --> 15:47.795
and you smell better.

15:47.830 --> 15:50.003
Well, they finally spelled my name right,

15:50.038 --> 15:52.757
the one time I wish they hadn't.

15:52.792 --> 15:54.713
I can't believe I let her
talk me into this.

15:54.748 --> 15:57.071
There are a few things
that don't add up.

15:57.106 --> 15:58.216
What? Footprints?

15:58.251 --> 15:59.458
And the pill dispenser.

15:59.493 --> 16:01.633
Monk, there's always going
to be a loose end or two.

16:01.668 --> 16:06.938
Lest we forget that the monkey and
the victim were in a locked room alone.

16:06.973 --> 16:08.485
There is that.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.261
Look, I called the San francisco zoo,

16:10.296 --> 16:12.619
and they don't think a chimpanzee
can fire a handgun.

16:12.654 --> 16:13.736
Of course he can.

16:13.771 --> 16:15.394
If you can peel a banana,
you can fire a gun.

16:15.429 --> 16:17.411
- What, are you an expert now?
- Are you?

16:17.446 --> 16:18.464
More than you.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.949
Hey, children, let's not fight
in front of the monkey, okay?

16:20.984 --> 16:23.619
It's a legitimate question,
and we're going to settle it

16:23.654 --> 16:26.798
once and for all right now.

16:26.833 --> 16:29.676
Lieutenant, give me that gun.

16:31.679 --> 16:33.510
- Is it loaded?
- No, sir.

16:33.545 --> 16:36.766
- I emptied it myself.
- Good. Okay.

16:36.801 --> 16:39.597
I'm going downstairs
with our suspect.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.676
I'm going to hand him a gun,
and we'll see what happens.

16:41.711 --> 16:43.014
Great. I'm going with you.

16:43.049 --> 16:46.845
No, Sharona, it's just
me and Darwin.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.182
I'm trying to recreate the
conditions in the panic room.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.434
I'm going to lock the door,
and I'm not coming out until I'm satisfied.

16:52.469 --> 16:57.155
Let's go.
Come on.

17:02.792 --> 17:06.513
Have a seat.

17:14.208 --> 17:20.251
So...
I understand you can use tools.

17:21.145 --> 17:25.022
I know you've seen
one of these before.

17:25.058 --> 17:28.402
There's a tool for you.

17:28.436 --> 17:31.990
- Monk, can I run a theory by you?
- Sure.

17:32.025 --> 17:34.486
Suicide by monkey.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.683
- Suicide by monkey?
- Yeah,

17:37.718 --> 17:41.518
what if Ian blackburn trained the
chimp to shoot him in the panic room?

17:41.553 --> 17:43.238
Why would he do that?

17:43.273 --> 17:45.715
So his wife could collect
on the insurance.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.549
Thus, suicide by monkey.

17:47.584 --> 17:50.220
Thus, theory by monkey.

17:50.255 --> 17:54.119
Randy, Ian blackburn had
a $100,000 life insurance policy.

17:54.154 --> 17:58.749
Chloe is worth, what, $20 million?

17:58.784 --> 18:02.259
It doesn't seem worth it.

18:05.271 --> 18:09.559
- That's true.
- You keep thinking, butch.

18:09.594 --> 18:12.403
You think you're pretty
cute, don't you?

18:12.438 --> 18:15.362
Hey, get your fingers out
of your ears. I'm talking to you.

18:15.397 --> 18:17.447
I'm talking to you.

18:17.482 --> 18:19.103
Are you laughing at me?

18:19.138 --> 18:22.075
I said, are you laughing at me.

18:22.110 --> 18:24.900
I think you've got an
attitude problem, my friend.

18:24.935 --> 18:26.970
Okay, opposable thumbs.

18:27.005 --> 18:28.339
Whoop-de-doo.

18:28.374 --> 18:31.710
Here, pick it up.
Here you go.

18:31.745 --> 18:33.637
What do you think of that?

18:33.672 --> 18:38.325
- Randy, do you have another piece of gum?
- Yeah, sure.

18:44.344 --> 18:47.167
Uh-oh.

18:47.202 --> 18:50.306
Is there a problem?

18:52.520 --> 18:55.540
Wrong gun.

18:58.276 --> 18:59.763
Go on, pull the trigger.

18:59.798 --> 19:03.725
Go on, pull it. Pull it. Pull it.
Pull, pull the trigger.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.361
You hungry, huh?

19:06.396 --> 19:08.252
Bang.

19:08.287 --> 19:10.159
Come on.

19:14.393 --> 19:18.469
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

19:22.664 --> 19:26.100
Here you go. Monkey. Hey.
You like that?

19:26.135 --> 19:30.323
Do you like him? Huh?

19:30.358 --> 19:35.825
Captain, open the door!
Open the door!

19:35.860 --> 19:39.239
Go away! Go away!
I'm not done yet!

19:39.274 --> 19:43.032
I told you to leave me alone!
Go away! I'm not done yet!

19:43.067 --> 19:45.288
The other door!

19:55.930 --> 19:58.093
Captain, captain!
The gun's loaded!

19:58.128 --> 20:00.429
Captain, the gun's loaded!

20:03.014 --> 20:06.967
- It's loaded!
- You've got the wrong gun! It's loaded!

20:07.002 --> 20:08.267
Come on, come on.

20:08.302 --> 20:11.901
- Empty gun!??? empty!
- It's loaded!

20:15.894 --> 20:19.692
Give me your best shot,
your stupid primate!

20:31.627 --> 20:34.961
The case is closed.

20:34.996 --> 20:38.333
Sharona, you were there.
He fired the gun.

20:38.368 --> 20:42.436
Yeah, but he didn't aim it.
He didn't hit anything.

20:42.471 --> 20:45.702
Look, in the panic room,
Ian blackburn was shot four times.

20:45.737 --> 20:47.114
Four shots, four hits.

20:47.149 --> 20:48.779
There is no way Darwin
could have done that.

20:48.814 --> 20:51.062
- There's no way.
- Maybe you're right.

20:51.097 --> 20:53.901
Okay, now, are you saying that
because you agree with me

20:53.936 --> 20:55.058
or because you're afraid of me?

20:55.093 --> 20:57.855
I'm saying that because
I'm afraid of you.

20:59.442 --> 21:02.480
Hey, good choice.
That's the ultra 4000.

21:02.515 --> 21:05.547
The strongest safe in the world.
Hi, I'm Kurt wolff.

21:05.582 --> 21:07.363
- Welcome to wolff security.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

21:07.398 --> 21:09.408
I'm, I'm Sharona,
and this is Adrian monk.

21:09.443 --> 21:10.909
Hi, how are you?

21:10.944 --> 21:13.664
All right, well,
what can I do for you guys today?

21:13.699 --> 21:16.757
We've got everything you'll need
to sleep a little easier at night.

21:16.792 --> 21:18.889
Oh, I doubt that.

21:18.924 --> 21:21.260
Let's see, I design
most of the stuff myself,

21:21.295 --> 21:25.443
like this necklace, for instance.
Take a look.

21:25.478 --> 21:27.631
It shoots pepper spray.

21:27.666 --> 21:30.165
I custom-made it for a famous movie star.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.833
Joey heatherton?

21:32.868 --> 21:38.068
Um, I can't tell you who.
All I can say is, uh, she's very beautiful.

21:38.103 --> 21:41.299
Joey heatherton.

21:42.865 --> 21:44.639
- Mr. Wolff?
- Yeah?

21:44.674 --> 21:48.321
We're helping the police investigate
the death of Ian blackburn.

21:48.356 --> 21:52.838
Oh. Um, according to the news,
they already know who did it.

21:52.873 --> 21:59.435
- That monkey of his.
- Well, he's a chimpanzee, okay?

21:59.470 --> 22:01.751
Um, you built the panic
room for them, huh?

22:01.786 --> 22:03.245
- Is that right?
- Um, yes, that's true.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.726
I designed it and installed it.

22:04.761 --> 22:07.389
Excuse me. Could I see that, please?

22:07.424 --> 22:09.046
Could I take a look at this?

22:09.081 --> 22:13.393
Sure. Excuse me.

22:13.428 --> 22:16.299
That $17,000 camera?

22:16.334 --> 22:18.705
Are you sure you're still interested?

22:18.740 --> 22:20.766
Okay. Well, I got to hand it to you.

22:20.801 --> 22:21.907
You got great taste.

22:21.942 --> 22:23.614
That is the best camera
in the world.

22:23.649 --> 22:26.371
I just sold five of them
to the British secret service.

22:26.406 --> 22:28.185
How did Chloe hire you?

22:28.220 --> 22:30.090
Oh, I've known Chloe for years.

22:30.125 --> 22:33.007
I used to do security for her band
when they were on the road.

22:33.042 --> 22:35.190
You know, most musicians
can be a little...

22:35.225 --> 22:37.039
- but, uh, she's okay.
- The silver one.

22:37.074 --> 22:39.375
Good people. It's a shame
what happened to them.

22:39.410 --> 22:41.008
Too big.
That's too big.

22:41.043 --> 22:44.542
- So there's only one way in, huh?
- Um, yeah.

22:44.577 --> 22:49.083
Once that door is locked,
there is, you'd need a tank to get inside.

22:50.304 --> 22:52.262
Ah. Here we go.

22:52.297 --> 22:56.022
The finest camera in the world.

23:03.616 --> 23:07.939
- Is that it?
- That's it. Thank you.

23:08.576 --> 23:11.329
- Let's go.
- Thanks a lot.

23:11.364 --> 23:13.984
I already told the police
everything I know.

23:14.019 --> 23:19.077
Well, we really appreciate your time.
I, I'm a big fan.

23:19.112 --> 23:20.487
And what about you?

23:20.522 --> 23:25.999
Me, no. I haven't really listened to
the pop rock 'n' roll since, uh... - Ever.

23:26.034 --> 23:29.940
That's about right. Ever.
But I have heard of you. - Thank you.

23:29.975 --> 23:33.639
And not just because the monkey
killed your husband.

23:33.674 --> 23:36.426
Can I get you something?
A drink?

23:36.461 --> 23:38.515
No, no, no, we're okay.

23:38.550 --> 23:42.659
Um, we just want to ask a couple
of questions, that's all.

23:42.694 --> 23:45.666
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

23:45.701 --> 23:47.720
Go ahead.

23:47.755 --> 23:50.100
- Mrs. Blackburn..
- Chloe.

23:50.135 --> 23:53.819
Chloe blackburn.
On sunday night,

23:53.854 --> 23:58.167
the police phoned you while they were
trying to open the panic room.

23:58.202 --> 24:02.632
Yeah, I was in Dallas.
At least, I think it was Dallas.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.380
It's all sort of a blur.

24:04.415 --> 24:08.982
And at that time, you said
that Ian probably killed himself.

24:09.017 --> 24:11.054
Ian was clinically depressed.

24:11.089 --> 24:13.976
He was in therapy and on medication.

24:14.011 --> 24:17.615
He talked about suicide all the time.

24:17.650 --> 24:20.561
Did you use the panic room a lot?

24:20.596 --> 24:25.397
Ian did. Um, he went there to meditate
and to get away from the world.

24:25.432 --> 24:27.855
Maybe even to get away from me.

24:27.890 --> 24:29.658
I don't know.

24:29.693 --> 24:33.362
Look, this isn't
the best time for me.

24:33.397 --> 24:35.378
The memorial service is tomorrow.

24:35.413 --> 24:36.743
Maybe we can talk next week.

24:36.778 --> 24:39.747
Next week's too late. They're
going to put Darwin to sleep.

24:39.782 --> 24:43.553
Good. That animal killed my husband.

24:43.588 --> 24:46.625
I couldn't stand having that beast around.

24:46.660 --> 24:49.654
- Is that all?
- Um...

24:49.689 --> 24:52.452
I'm in mourning, Mr. Monk.

24:52.487 --> 24:55.771
- I really need to be alone.
- Of course.

24:55.806 --> 25:01.006
- So then who was here last night?
- Um, I had a friend over.

25:01.041 --> 25:05.317
- We had some wine.
- Well, champagne.

25:05.352 --> 25:11.406
- Well, you're wearing a man's shirt.
- It's my husband's.

25:11.441 --> 25:13.560
Now do you believe me?
She's sleeping around.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.648
That's not a crime. In her world,
it's standard operating procedure.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.366
Can't we get a court order?

25:18.401 --> 25:20.879
Adrian, they're going to put
Darwin to sleep. He's innocent.

25:20.914 --> 25:24.497
Sharona, I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do.

25:36.275 --> 25:39.477
Honey, it's okay, okay.

25:40.641 --> 25:44.987
It's okay, honey.
I got you. It's okay.

25:48.723 --> 25:52.651
- I hate this.
- Why don't you stay out here, sir?

25:52.686 --> 25:57.239
- I can handle her.
- Oh, you can? Since when?

25:58.086 --> 26:00.367
- Hey.
- Sharona, we need to talk.

26:00.402 --> 26:05.511
- About what?
- I think you know.

26:05.546 --> 26:08.057
What happened here?
Did you have a party?

26:08.092 --> 26:11.795
Uh, it's Benjy.
He never picks anything up.

26:11.830 --> 26:14.604
Sharona, where's Darwin?

26:15.372 --> 26:20.153
- What are you talking about?
- We're going to find him. Is he here?

26:20.188 --> 26:24.347
Hey, will you put that away?
This is my house.

26:24.382 --> 26:28.717
- He's killed before.
- No, he hasn't.

26:28.752 --> 26:32.163
Sharona...
we know that you took him.

26:32.198 --> 26:35.111
Now, either you tell us where he is,
or I'm going to have to take you in.

26:35.146 --> 26:37.989
That is the law.

26:38.024 --> 26:40.824
Living room secure.
I'm heading to the kitchen.

26:40.859 --> 26:46.989
Randy...you don't have to use the
walkie-talkie. I'm 10 feet away.

26:47.024 --> 26:50.913
Roger.
Roger that.

26:55.329 --> 26:59.645
- Hey, what happened here?
- Benjy threw up.

26:59.680 --> 27:04.069
- On the wall?
- It was pretty awful.

27:04.104 --> 27:07.741
Kitchen secure.

27:08.776 --> 27:11.248
Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!

27:11.283 --> 27:16.028
False alarm!
False alarm.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.207
False alarm. Stuffed bear.

27:19.242 --> 27:22.629
- Give me that.
- Sharona...

27:24.082 --> 27:25.854
You were seen.

27:25.889 --> 27:27.488
The animal shelter has
a surveillance camera.

27:27.523 --> 27:30.756
It recorded your car's
license plate as you drove away.

27:30.791 --> 27:33.292
They were going to kill him.

27:33.327 --> 27:37.643
Are you going to tell me
where he is?

27:37.678 --> 27:38.938
I can't.

27:38.973 --> 27:41.401
Then I'm going to have to arrest you

27:41.436 --> 27:44.083
for breaking and entering
and obstruction.

27:44.118 --> 27:46.516
Go ahead.

27:46.551 --> 27:50.227
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Oh, Randy, give me a break.

27:50.262 --> 27:54.914
Damn it, Sharona,
you're under arrest. Just turn around.

27:56.857 --> 28:00.806
- Mom.
- Benjy, hey.

28:00.841 --> 28:02.188
What are you doing?

28:02.223 --> 28:06.702
Um, your mom bet Randy that she
could get out of his handcuffs,

28:06.737 --> 28:11.208
and, uh, she couldn't, so, uh...

28:11.243 --> 28:16.074
Take them off.
Take them off.

28:21.483 --> 28:24.507
- Benjy, you were right.
- About what?

28:24.542 --> 28:26.832
About standing up for that
little boy in school.

28:26.867 --> 28:28.492
You did the right thing.

28:28.527 --> 28:32.725
So now I'm standing up for somebody
who can't protect himself.

28:32.760 --> 28:36.731
- You mean Darwin?
- Yeah.

28:37.782 --> 28:40.294
Look, everything's going
to be okay, all right?

28:40.329 --> 28:44.173
Captain Stottlemeyer's going
to take you to aunt Gail's,

28:44.208 --> 28:48.907
and you tell her to call Adrian.
He'll know what to do...

28:48.942 --> 28:52.781
after I tell him.
All right.

29:01.216 --> 29:05.673
Hi. Remember me?

29:05.708 --> 29:09.630
Adrian, it's only been
two hours. Come on.

29:10.322 --> 29:12.553
- How's Benjy?
- Oh, he's good.

29:12.588 --> 29:15.904
I just talked to him.
Said he's very proud of you.

29:15.939 --> 29:18.721
- Yeah.
- Oh.

29:18.756 --> 29:21.906
Oh. Wipe.
Sharona, wipe.

29:21.941 --> 29:23.454
I don't have any wipes.
I'm in jail.

29:23.489 --> 29:27.370
Oh, what is it?
Oh, my god, get it off me.

29:27.405 --> 29:29.275
Oh, god, get it off.
It's jail goo.

29:29.310 --> 29:32.111
- This is, this is jail goo.
- You know what? You know what?

29:32.146 --> 29:33.551
I put an extra wipe
in your pocket.

29:33.586 --> 29:36.685
Give me, give me the wipe.

29:36.720 --> 29:39.957
Oh, god.
It's connected.

29:39.992 --> 29:43.668
Will you please relax?
I'm in no mood.

29:45.523 --> 29:47.890
Oh, my god.
Jail goo. God.

29:47.925 --> 29:52.926
Oh.

29:53.723 --> 29:56.076
Listen, Sharona,

29:56.111 --> 29:58.659
you have to tell the police
where Darwin is.

29:58.694 --> 30:02.152
- Please.
- I can't do that. They'll kill him.

30:02.187 --> 30:03.308
I'm falling apart here.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.068
Look, if you want me out of here,

30:05.103 --> 30:07.623
all you have to do is prove
that Darwin is innocent.

30:07.658 --> 30:10.497
- I think Chloe did it.
- Chloe? How?

30:10.532 --> 30:15.578
I don't know. You're the genius.
You figure it out.

31:59.615 --> 32:03.761
Dr, Dr. Kroger, please.

32:03.796 --> 32:07.050
It's Adrian monk.

32:07.085 --> 32:11.873
Yes.
When, when do you expect him back?

32:11.908 --> 32:14.735
I understand.

32:14.770 --> 32:17.145
Well, it is, uh..

32:17.180 --> 32:20.206
it is rather important.

32:20.241 --> 32:23.679
All right, good bye.
Thank you.

32:49.197 --> 32:52.986
- Adrian, are you all right?
- Dr. Kroger, yes. Thank you for coming.

32:53.021 --> 32:55.127
Well, yeah, I usually
don't make house calls,

32:55.162 --> 32:57.040
but you said that it couldn't wait.

32:57.075 --> 32:59.427
Would you like some juice?
There's an ape in my house.

32:59.462 --> 33:00.863
I have an ape in my house.

33:00.898 --> 33:06.762
Well, I've never, I've never
been to your house before.

33:07.463 --> 33:12.005
Adrian, is, is that Darwin
from the murder case?

33:12.040 --> 33:17.167
Well, uh, uh, Uh, maybe, maybe you
should just call the police.

33:17.202 --> 33:21.727
I can't do that.
Sharona left him here.

33:21.762 --> 33:26.310
She, she's protecting him.
She'd never forgive me.

33:26.345 --> 33:28.990
Hmm. Thank you.
Thank you.

33:29.025 --> 33:32.903
Um, okay, okay.
Why don't we just leave him here and

33:32.938 --> 33:35.546
- and we'll just go back to my office?
- I can't do that, either.

33:35.581 --> 33:38.827
She expects me to take care of him.

33:38.862 --> 33:42.834
Well, you know, Adrian, I, I can see that,
that your space has been violated,

33:42.869 --> 33:47.844
and I think you're handling it very well.
I'm, I'm proud of you.

33:47.879 --> 33:52.578
- How do, how do you feel?
- I'm fine. These things happen.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.923
- What can you do?
- Exactly, exactly.

33:54.958 --> 33:57.858
See, these are all just material objects.

33:57.893 --> 34:04.644
You know, you can always replace anything
that he breaks or chews or...pees on.

34:04.679 --> 34:08.428
Chews or pees on.
Chews or pees on.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.038
Where are you?
Are you in here?

34:11.072 --> 34:14.313
Hey, monk,
did you put this up?

34:14.348 --> 34:17.185
You can't sell this house.
You're renting.

34:17.219 --> 34:21.449
- I can't live here anymore.
- But it's not your house.

34:21.484 --> 34:24.592
- Chews or pees on.
- What are you, mental?

34:24.628 --> 34:26.985
Excuse me. I'm Adrian's
psychiatrist Dr. Kroger.

34:27.020 --> 34:30.918
You are... - I'm Leo navarro.
I'm Adrian's landlord.

34:30.953 --> 34:32.223
What the hell is going on here?

34:32.257 --> 34:34.839
Adrian is having a dissociative episode.

34:34.873 --> 34:38.020
He's just not thinking straight.

34:38.054 --> 34:40.985
What the hell is that?
No pets allowed.

34:41.021 --> 34:44.324
You know the rules.
Hey!

34:44.359 --> 34:47.272
Get off of that!

34:54.445 --> 34:56.788
What did I do?

34:58.726 --> 35:02.362
Excuse me.
Let me try something.

35:17.476 --> 35:19.973
What, he hates bald guys?

35:20.008 --> 35:24.108
Ad, Adrian, what's,
what's going on?

35:24.143 --> 35:28.439
I think I just solved the case.

35:29.813 --> 35:35.268
I think I know what happened
in that panic room.

35:38.652 --> 35:41.697
It was here the whole time.
I can't believe we missed it.

35:41.732 --> 35:43.757
- What is it?
- Digital tape recorder.

35:43.792 --> 35:47.576
Ian blackburn used to
record memos to himself.

35:47.611 --> 35:52.255
Look...the record switch is still
in the on position.

35:52.290 --> 35:54.542
I think it might have
recorded the murder.

35:54.577 --> 35:57.407
- Well, let's just play it back.
- No, no, we can't touch it. It's broken.

35:57.442 --> 35:59.830
If we move it,
we might damage the chip.

35:59.865 --> 36:02.647
The FBI will be here tomorrow
with a tech crew.

36:02.682 --> 36:06.739
- It'll be safe in there until then, right?
- Uh, yes, sir.

36:06.774 --> 36:09.450
Safer than the bank of England.

36:09.485 --> 36:10.930
- Here's the key for you.
- Good deal.

36:10.965 --> 36:13.310
- Is there anything else, uh...
- No, that'll do it.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.081
- Thank you very much.
- All right.

36:15.116 --> 36:17.572
- When's the FBI coming?
- First thing in the morning.

36:17.607 --> 36:21.657
Excuse me. - I can't wait to hear
what's on that tape.

36:21.692 --> 36:27.418
We'll finally know exactly
what happened in there. - Yep.

36:31.325 --> 36:33.516
- Ow!
- Sharona?

36:33.551 --> 36:35.976
- Adrian?
- Shh! Over here!

36:36.011 --> 36:38.452
Come here, come here.

36:38.487 --> 36:40.711
Sit down.

36:41.342 --> 36:42.936
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

36:42.971 --> 36:44.914
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

36:44.949 --> 36:46.215
I'm okay, too.

36:46.250 --> 36:49.259
I think we're all really okay.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.888
By the way, I found your monkey.

36:51.923 --> 36:53.427
Oh, god, I'm sorry about that.

36:53.462 --> 36:54.682
Look, I'll help you clean it up.

36:54.717 --> 36:56.537
Nah, I'll be fine.

36:56.572 --> 36:58.772
I've got 17 maids in there working on it.

36:58.807 --> 37:01.756
Shh! He's going to hear us.

37:01.791 --> 37:03.066
We're on a stakeout.

37:03.101 --> 37:04.604
Look, so, so what's going on?

37:04.639 --> 37:06.868
They let me out, but they
didn't tell me anything.

37:06.903 --> 37:08.737
You were right about the chimp.

37:08.772 --> 37:10.109
He wasn't involved at all.

37:10.144 --> 37:12.009
You were right about Chloe, too.

37:12.044 --> 37:14.858
She had a lover.
They were in on it together.

37:14.893 --> 37:17.922
- They killed her husband.
- Now, are you sure?

37:17.957 --> 37:21.219
There was a witness.
Your new boyfriend Darwin.

37:21.254 --> 37:23.584
Actually, Darwin solved the case.

37:23.619 --> 37:28.677
Yesterday at my apartment, my landlord
came in. Darwin went berserk.

37:28.712 --> 37:33.692
Then I remembered he acted
the same way on monday

37:33.727 --> 37:37.031
when he saw the animal control officer.

37:37.066 --> 37:39.306
The two men have something in common.

37:39.341 --> 37:43.579
- They're both bald.
- Bald.

37:43.614 --> 37:47.874
- Darwin is afraid of bald men.
- Why wouldn't he be?

37:47.909 --> 37:51.845
Ian blackburn was killed by a bald man,
and Darwin saw it happen.

37:51.880 --> 37:55.407
A bald man, the security guy.
Kurt wolff.

37:55.442 --> 37:59.054
The man who built the panic room.

37:59.089 --> 38:02.205
When he installed it, he built
a secret crawl space.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.297
It goes from the basement
to the panic room.

38:04.332 --> 38:07.437
There's a secret panel behind the furnace.
We found it last night.

38:07.472 --> 38:10.834
Excuse me, would you stop
pointing that in my face?

38:10.869 --> 38:13.334
- But you're talking.
- You can hear me talking.

38:13.369 --> 38:17.225
You don't need to see me talking.
You know it's me.

38:19.264 --> 38:22.831
Thank you.

38:25.355 --> 38:33.455
- He needs to see you.
- Okay, fine.

38:33.490 --> 38:39.588
So why? - Love and money,
the oldest motive in the world.

38:39.623 --> 38:42.100
Chloe met Wolff when he was
doing security for her,

38:42.135 --> 38:44.813
and they hooked up,
as the kids would say.

38:44.848 --> 38:47.410
The divorce would have
cost her $10 million.

38:47.445 --> 38:51.640
So they were planning this
for, like, a year? - Exactly.

38:51.675 --> 38:55.489
Kurt didn't build the panic room
to protect Ian blackburn.

38:55.524 --> 38:57.043
He built it to kill him.

38:57.078 --> 39:00.426
The plan was to make it
look like a suicide.

39:00.461 --> 39:01.799
It was a brilliant plan.

39:01.834 --> 39:04.621
That night Wolff snuck
into the panic room.

39:04.656 --> 39:06.402
He set the test alarm button,
so the alarm rang,

39:06.437 --> 39:10.851
but only inside the house.

39:10.886 --> 39:13.868
That's how he lured Ian
into the panic room.

39:13.903 --> 39:19.016
The plan was for Ian to be found dead
the next day in a locked room.

39:19.051 --> 39:21.353
Everybody would think
that he killed himself.

39:21.388 --> 39:23.713
There would be no other explanation.

39:23.748 --> 39:26.205
It was a perfect plan.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.043
Not quite perfect.

39:28.078 --> 39:31.627
They didn't count on one thing.

39:31.662 --> 39:34.121
Darwin.

39:36.359 --> 39:40.643
Darwin must have grabbed for the gun,
and there was a struggle.

39:46.449 --> 39:49.905
Ian was shot four times,
twice in the back.

39:49.940 --> 39:52.642
Their suicide story wasn't going to fly.

39:52.677 --> 39:56.500
- So he framed Darwin?
- Well, it was a long shot,

39:56.535 --> 39:59.961
but what else could he do?

39:59.996 --> 40:04.126
Of course, now he had to explain
what Ian was doing in the panic room,

40:04.161 --> 40:06.308
So as he left, he broke a window

40:06.343 --> 40:10.460
to make it look like a burglar
had tried to get in.

40:10.495 --> 40:17.136
And that's how we found it.
Broken window, killer monkey.

40:17.171 --> 40:21.504
- Can we prove it?
- That's why we're here.

40:21.539 --> 40:26.125
Shh. He's here.
He took the bait.

40:26.160 --> 40:29.870
He's in the basement.
He just climbed into the crawl space.

40:29.905 --> 40:36.393
Okay.
It's showtime.

41:03.420 --> 41:06.414
- What took you so long?
- Were you looking for this?

41:06.449 --> 41:08.973
You shouldn't have bothered.
We already played it.

41:09.008 --> 41:12.161
There's nothing on it.

41:12.196 --> 41:15.915
Ah, this is all going to go bad.
Would you excuse me?

41:15.950 --> 41:20.244
You're under arrest, Mr. Wolff,
for the murder of Ian blackburn.

41:20.279 --> 41:25.358
You have a right to remain silent.

41:40.572 --> 41:43.841
Uh, can we, can we go now?

41:43.876 --> 41:46.682
- Hey, Darwin. Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Darwin, hey.

41:46.717 --> 41:48.947
How you doing?
You remember us?

41:48.982 --> 41:51.051
- Oh, he asks about you all the time.
- Really? Is he doing good?

41:51.086 --> 41:53.109
He's fine, as long as
I keep my hat on.

41:53.144 --> 41:56.910
He still doesn't like
guys who are b, a, l, d.

41:56.945 --> 41:59.161
Bald.

41:59.196 --> 42:00.621
So what's going to happen to him?

42:00.656 --> 42:02.253
Well, he's off to the san francisco zoo,

42:02.288 --> 42:04.581
where he's going to be
treated like a prince.

42:04.616 --> 42:06.233
They say you can come
visit anytime you want.

42:06.268 --> 42:08.206
You, Benjy, and Mr. Monk
have a lifetime pass.

42:08.241 --> 42:10.425
Oh, a lifetime pass to the zoo.

42:10.460 --> 42:13.251
Your mom's a hero.

42:13.286 --> 42:16.131
- Is this for me? Is that for me?
- He's saying thank you.

42:16.166 --> 42:18.280
Yeah, that's good.
Then we have to go.

42:18.315 --> 42:20.115
Mr. Monk, he's trying
to say something to you.

42:20.150 --> 42:21.680
No, that's okay.
We got to go.

42:21.715 --> 42:25.436
No, no, no, no.

42:28.005 --> 42:31.082
Wipe. Wipe, wipe.
God.

42:31.117 --> 42:34.658
Worse than jail goo.
