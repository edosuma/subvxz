06:26.360 --> 06:28.680
Say, is this the moving-picture ship?

06:28.840 --> 06:30.640
<i>The Venture? Yeah.</i>

06:30.800 --> 06:34.200
<i>- Are you going on this crazy voyage?
- What's crazy about it?</i>

06:34.360 --> 06:38.240
<i>I don't know. But everybody is talking
about that crazy fella running it.</i>

06:38.400 --> 06:41.040
<i>- Carl Denham?
- Guess that's the name.</i>

06:41.200 --> 06:44.200
<i>He ain't scared of nothing.
If he wants a picture of lion</i>

06:44.360 --> 06:47.200
he just goes up to him
and tells him to look pleasant.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.960
<i>He's a tough egg. Why all this talk
about this voyage being crazy?</i>

06:51.120 --> 06:55.680
Everybody around the docks is talking
about the cargo, for one thing.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.800
And I never did see a ship
this size with such a crew.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.640
- Not enough men to handle her?
- Not enough!

07:01.800 --> 07:04.040
Three times more than
the ship needs.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.080
<i>I don't see where they're gonna
have room enough to sleep.</i>

07:07.240 --> 07:09.920
Hey, down there.
What do you want?

07:10.080 --> 07:12.440
- Denham aboard?
- Who are you?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.520
My name is Weston,
the theatrical agent.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.560
<i>Well, why didn't you say so?
Come on aboard.</i>

07:18.760 --> 07:23.200
<i>Denham's getting wild. I hope you've got
some good news for him.</i>

07:24.440 --> 07:28.040
Well, Mr. Denham, you know the reasons
for hurrying as well as I do.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.560
<i>Insurance company found out
we're carrying explosives.</i>

07:30.720 --> 07:32.960
Marshal will be aboard
tomorrow or next day.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.280
<i>If we make a legal case of it,
we'll be tied up for months?</i>

07:36.480 --> 07:39.440
With enough ammunition
to blow up the harbor.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.920
What do you think the marshal will say
to these new gas bombs of yours?

07:45.080 --> 07:48.600
According to you, one of them
is enough to knock out an elephant.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.760
<i>We've got to get where we're going
before the monsoon starts.</i>

07:51.960 --> 07:55.640
<i>- Trust me to see you through a blow.
- Oh, now, don't get sore, skipper.</i>

07:55.840 --> 07:59.840
<i>You can't run into the rainy season when
you're trying to make an outdoor picture.</i>

08:00.040 --> 08:02.240
Months wasted, money gone
and nothing to show.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.400
Still you always
bring back a picture.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.280
<i>And everybody says,
"There's only one Carl Denham."</i>

08:10.320 --> 08:12.440
Weston, I was just going ashore
to call you.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.440
<i>If I'd known that,
I would have waited.</i>

08:14.600 --> 08:17.120
This is the skipper.
Weston, the theatrical agent.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.280
I guess you met Driscoll,
the first mate.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.680
Well, Weston, how about the girl?

08:21.840 --> 08:23.680
<i>- It can't be done, Denham.
- What?</i>

08:23.840 --> 08:26.440
<i>It's got to be done.
Now, look here, Weston.</i>

08:26.640 --> 08:28.920
<i>Somebody's interfered
with every girl I try to hire.</i>

08:29.080 --> 08:32.159
Now all the agents in town
have shut down on me. All but you.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.120
<i>- You know I'm square.
- Everybody knows you're square.</i>

08:35.280 --> 08:37.520
<i>But you've got
a reputation for recklessness</i>

08:37.679 --> 08:40.520
<i>that can't be glossed over.
Then you're so secretive.</i>

08:40.720 --> 08:42.120
You said it.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.280
<i>Even skipper and mate don't
know where they're going, what.</i>

08:45.440 --> 08:47.920
<i>There you are.
I've got a conscience, Denham.</i>

08:48.080 --> 08:51.360
<i>I can't send a pretty girl
such as you ask on a job like this</i>

08:51.560 --> 08:54.760
without telling her what to expect.
- What is she to expect?

08:54.920 --> 08:57.800
To go off on a trip
for no one knows how long

08:58.000 --> 09:00.800
<i>to some spot
you don't even hint at</i>

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
the only woman on a ship with
the toughest mugs I ever looked at.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.840
I mean the crew.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.120
Good Lord, you talk as if
I never brought anybody back alive.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.040
The skipper and Driscoll
have stuck to me on two trips.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.520
<i>- They look well enough.
- Sure, we're healthy.</i>

09:20.720 --> 09:23.360
<i>But it's a different thing
taking a girl into danger.</i>

09:23.560 --> 09:25.600
<i>I suppose there's no danger
in New York.</i>

09:25.800 --> 09:28.600
Listen, there are dozens of girls
in this town

09:28.800 --> 09:31.520
that are in more danger
than they are with me.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.360
Yeah, but they know
that kind of danger.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.760
You never had a woman
in any of your pictures.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.920
- Why do you want one?
- Holy mackerel!

09:39.080 --> 09:41.080
Do you think I wanna haul
a woman around?

09:41.240 --> 09:44.080
- Then why?
- Because the public, bless them

09:44.240 --> 09:45.720
must have a pretty face.

09:45.920 --> 09:49.240
Sure, everybody likes romance.

09:49.400 --> 09:53.400
<i>Isn't there any romance or adventure
without having a flapper in it?</i>

09:53.560 --> 09:56.720
Well, Mr. Denham, why not take
a picture in a monastery?

09:56.920 --> 10:00.320
Makes me sore. I go out,
sweat blood to make a swell picture

10:00.480 --> 10:02.680
then the critics
and the exhibitors all say:

10:02.840 --> 10:06.200
<i>"If this picture had love interest,
it would gross twice as much."</i>

10:06.400 --> 10:09.840
<i>The public wants a girl, and this time
I'm gonna give what they want.</i>

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
<i>- Don't know where you'll get her.
- I've gotta get her, Weston.</i>

10:13.200 --> 10:14.560
<i>We've gotta leave by morning.</i>

10:14.720 --> 10:17.080
<i>- We've gotta be gone by daylight.
- Why?</i>

10:17.240 --> 10:19.400
<i>Well, there's a good reason.</i>

10:19.560 --> 10:22.200
Everything I hear about it
makes me like it less.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.040
<i>I'm glad I didn't get you a girl.</i>

10:24.200 --> 10:25.920
<i>You are, eh? Well, I'll show you.</i>

10:26.120 --> 10:29.280
<i>Do you think I'm gonna give up
because you can't find me a girl?</i>

10:29.440 --> 10:32.080
<i>I'm going to make
the greatest picture in the world.</i>

10:32.240 --> 10:34.920
<i>Something that nobody's
ever seen or heard of.</i>

10:35.080 --> 10:38.560
<i>They'll have to think up a lot
of new adjectives when I come back.</i>

10:38.760 --> 10:40.400
- Where you going?
- Going out

10:40.560 --> 10:44.520
and get a girl for my picture.
Even if I have to marry one.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.400
- Stand aside, please. Get your case later.
- Can I take my things?

11:14.400 --> 11:16.120
Say, lay off the shoving, will you?

11:16.280 --> 11:18.880
<i>- Oh, I didn't mean to shove you.
- Excuse me.</i>

11:19.080 --> 11:20.840
What do they give you in this joint?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.720
Soup tonight. Coffee and sinkers
in the morning.

11:43.160 --> 11:47.280
I catch you, you stealer.
Now, I get you cop. You like that, huh?

11:47.440 --> 11:50.760
<i>No, no. I didn't. Let me go.
I wanted to, but I didn't.</i>

11:50.920 --> 11:53.840
<i>- Had enough of these stealers.
- Dry up. Kid didn't take any.</i>

11:54.000 --> 11:56.240
<i>- Truly I didn't.
- Three people this week...</i>

11:56.440 --> 11:57.920
<i>- Here... Here's a buck.
- A buck.</i>

11:58.080 --> 11:59.640
Scram.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.040
Hey, taxi!

12:25.240 --> 12:27.200
Feeling better?

12:27.360 --> 12:29.320
Yes, thank you.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.280
<i>- You're very kind.
- Don't you fool yourself.</i>

12:32.440 --> 12:35.880
<i>I'm not bothering
about you just out of kindness.</i>

12:39.520 --> 12:42.880
<i>- How'd you ever get into this fix?
- Bad luck, I guess.</i>

12:43.040 --> 12:44.720
There are a lot of girls like me.

12:44.920 --> 12:49.560
- Not many with your looks.
- I can get by in good clothes all right.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.720
- But when a girl gets too shabby...
- No family?

12:52.880 --> 12:54.680
Supposed to have an uncle someplace.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.920
Did you ever do any acting?

12:58.080 --> 13:01.120
I used to do extra work now
and then over on Long Island.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.080
<i>The studio's closed now.</i>

13:03.280 --> 13:05.840
<i>- What's your name?
- Ann Darrow.</i>

13:06.040 --> 13:08.040
<i>Fine. I've got a job for you.</i>

13:09.000 --> 13:10.560
Costumes on the ship
will fit you.

13:10.720 --> 13:13.360
If the shops are still open,
I can get clothes for you.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.000
- Come on.
- But...

13:15.160 --> 13:18.440
<i>- But what is it?
- It's money and adventure and fame.</i>

13:18.600 --> 13:21.120
<i>It's the thrill of a lifetime.
A long sea voyage</i>

13:21.320 --> 13:23.760
that starts at
6:00 tomorrow morning.

13:23.920 --> 13:25.680
No, wait.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.000
<i>I don't understand.
You must tell me.</i>

13:29.200 --> 13:32.040
I do want the job so

13:32.440 --> 13:34.640
<i>but I can't.
- Oh, I see.</i>

13:34.840 --> 13:37.880
<i>No, you've got me wrong.
This is strictly business.</i>

13:40.360 --> 13:42.880
- I only wanted...
- Sure. Sure you did.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.920
<i>I got a little excited and I forgot
you didn't understand.</i>

13:47.600 --> 13:51.480
<i>Listen, I'm Carl Denham.
Ever heard of me?</i>

13:51.640 --> 13:55.360
Yes, yes. You make moving pictures
in jungles and places.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.200
<i>That's right. And I pick you
as lead in my next picture.</i>

13:58.400 --> 14:00.600
We sail at 6.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.640
- Where to?
- A long way off.

14:03.800 --> 14:08.360
<i>And listen, Ann, I'm on the level.
No funny business.</i>

14:09.520 --> 14:14.880
- What do I have to do?
- Just trust me and keep your chin up.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.240
Hey, you men on that winch

14:34.440 --> 14:37.400
down below on the deck
and help with these hatches.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.920
Hurry this line forward.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.280
Forward, you farmer and up here!

14:51.480 --> 14:53.120
What are you doing up here?

14:53.280 --> 14:56.240
- I just wanted to see.
- Oh, you just wanted to see.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.240
<i>Well, I'm sorry.
Make that line fast!</i>

14:59.400 --> 15:01.520
<i>You're that girl Denham
picked, aren't you?</i>

15:01.680 --> 15:05.560
<i>Yes. I think this is awfully exciting.
I've never been on a ship before.</i>

15:05.720 --> 15:07.840
<i>I've never been on one
with a woman before.</i>

15:08.680 --> 15:11.320
<i>I guess you don't think much
of women on ships?</i>

15:11.480 --> 15:13.600
<i>No, they're a nuisance.</i>

15:13.800 --> 15:16.680
<i>- I'll try not to be.
- You've been in the way already.</i>

15:16.880 --> 15:19.520
Bring that ladder aboard!

15:20.080 --> 15:21.520
Well, you better stay below.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.200
What? The whole voyage?

15:25.920 --> 15:28.240
<i>I'm afraid I didn't apologize
for hitting you.</i>

15:28.400 --> 15:30.800
That was a pretty tough rap
on the chin.

15:39.560 --> 15:42.520
<i>- Well, we're off.
- We're off.</i>

15:55.840 --> 15:59.080
<i>Say, how many potatoes do you think
you've peeled in six weeks?</i>

15:59.240 --> 16:00.560
Too many.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.080
<i>Sailors eat an awful lot,
don't they?</i>

16:03.240 --> 16:05.720
All time eat.
Someday me go back China.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.200
Never see no more potatoes.

16:09.440 --> 16:12.600
<i>- Charlie, isn't the ocean wonderful?
- Very pretty.</i>

16:12.800 --> 16:15.880
Pretty soon you be all same sailor,
only no eat so much.

16:16.040 --> 16:19.200
<i>I'd like to be. Only, of course,
it wasn't so nice up north</i>

16:19.360 --> 16:21.600
when it was cold
and rough was it?

16:21.760 --> 16:26.480
Ocean very nice when you order
weather or some eggs for breakfast.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.040
- Hello, Ann.
- Hello, Jack.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.560
Where you been all morning?

16:34.760 --> 16:36.320
Trying on costumes
for Mr. Denham.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.800
<i>He's gonna make some tests of me
here on deck</i>

16:39.000 --> 16:41.680
if the light is right.
- Tests, why?

16:42.600 --> 16:47.360
Oh, to see which side of my face
looks best and all that.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.200
Both sides look all right to me.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.160
<i>Yes, but you're not
the movie director.</i>

16:53.320 --> 16:56.120
<i>If I was, you wouldn't be here.</i>

16:56.680 --> 16:59.680
Well, is that a nice thing to say.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.320
This is no place for a girl.

17:02.520 --> 17:06.319
<i>I wish you wouldn't keep harping
on that. It's very mean of you.</i>

17:06.480 --> 17:09.800
<i>Anybody would think
I'd been a lot of trouble.</i>

17:09.960 --> 17:14.760
<i>I haven't. You can't say I've been
one bit of trouble to anyone</i>

17:15.160 --> 17:16.760
have I?

17:16.920 --> 17:19.480
<i>- Sure you have. Sure you have.
- I don't see...</i>

17:19.640 --> 17:21.599
Well, how?

17:21.760 --> 17:24.160
Just... Just being around is trouble.

17:24.560 --> 17:28.240
Oh, dear, and I thought everything
was going so nicely.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.960
<i>Oh, you're all right.</i>

17:30.120 --> 17:33.120
<i>But women just can't help
being a bother.</i>

17:33.280 --> 17:36.240
- Made that way I guess.
- Well, anyhow...

17:37.320 --> 17:41.200
<i>I've had the happiest time
of my life on this old ship.</i>

17:41.360 --> 17:43.320
<i>That's... That's fine.</i>

17:48.960 --> 17:50.320
Say...

17:50.480 --> 17:51.960
Did you really mean that, Ann?

17:52.120 --> 17:56.920
<i>Of course. Everyone's so nice to me.
Dr. Denham and the skipper...</i>

17:57.080 --> 18:00.960
<i>Don't you think the skipper
is a sweet old lamb?</i>

18:01.400 --> 18:03.640
<i>I'd hate to have him
hear me say that.</i>

18:03.800 --> 18:05.480
<i>Iggy's nice to me.</i>

18:05.680 --> 18:09.280
Iggy likes me better than
he likes anybody onboard.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.520
<i>Don't you, lggy?</i>

18:14.160 --> 18:17.680
<i>- That's right. Of course you do.
- Beauty and the beast, eh?</i>

18:17.840 --> 18:20.320
Well, now, I never thought
I was good-looking.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.720
<i>Put on one of the costumes.
The light's right for those tests now.</i>

18:23.880 --> 18:27.800
<i>All right, Mr. Denham.
I won't be a minute.</i>

18:27.960 --> 18:30.600
Beauty and the beast.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.920
Mr. Denham

18:33.080 --> 18:34.800
<i>l'm gonna do some butting in.</i>

18:34.960 --> 18:37.120
<i>- What's your trouble?
- When do we find out</i>

18:37.280 --> 18:38.960
<i>where we're going?
- Pretty soon.</i>

18:39.120 --> 18:40.800
Will you tell us
what happens after?

18:40.960 --> 18:43.920
<i>How can I? I'm not a fortuneteller.</i>

18:44.080 --> 18:46.080
<i>You must have
some idea what you're after.</i>

18:46.280 --> 18:47.880
<i>What's the matter?
You going soft.</i>

18:48.040 --> 18:51.240
<i>Oh, you know I'm not.
Not for myself.</i>

18:51.400 --> 18:54.200
- For Ann.
- Oh, you have gone soft on her, eh?

18:54.400 --> 18:57.880
<i>I've got enough troubles without
a love affair to complicate things.</i>

18:58.040 --> 19:01.320
- Better cut it out, Jack.
- Love affair.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.400
<i>- Think I'm gonna fall for any dame?
- I never knew it to fail.</i>

19:04.560 --> 19:07.600
Some big hard-boiled egg gets
a look at a pretty face, bang

19:07.800 --> 19:10.040
<i>he cracks up, gets sappy.
- Who's going sappy?</i>

19:10.200 --> 19:11.600
<i>I haven't run out on you?</i>

19:11.760 --> 19:13.560
<i>No. You're a pretty tough guy.</i>

19:13.720 --> 19:16.320
But if beauty gets you, you...

19:17.920 --> 19:21.000
<i>I'm going right
into a theme song here.</i>

19:21.480 --> 19:25.720
<i>- Say, what are you talking about?
- It's the idea of my picture.</i>

19:25.880 --> 19:27.800
The beast was a tough guy too.

19:27.960 --> 19:32.200
He could lick the world, but when
he saw beauty, she got him.

19:32.360 --> 19:36.240
He went soft, he forgot his wisdom
and the little fellas licked him.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.840
Think it over, Jack.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.240
Mr. Denham, skipper
wants you up on the bridge.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.600
<i>- He says we've reached the position.
- Good.</i>

19:42.760 --> 19:45.640
<i>Come on, Jack. You're in on this.
I'm gonna spill it.</i>

19:47.520 --> 19:51.480
<i>There's our noon position.
Two south, 90 east.</i>

19:52.040 --> 19:54.520
Now, you promised some information
when we got here.

19:54.720 --> 19:58.320
- Way west of Sumatra.
- And way out of any waters I know.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.720
I know the East Indies like
I do my own hand

20:00.880 --> 20:03.560
<i>but I've never been here.
- Where do we go from here?</i>

20:03.760 --> 20:05.400
- Southwest.
- Southwest?

20:05.600 --> 20:07.960
Well, there is nothing
for thousands of miles.

20:08.120 --> 20:11.200
<i>Keep your shirt on, skipper.
We're not going thousands of miles.</i>

20:11.360 --> 20:13.960
<i>Here's the island we're looking for.</i>

20:15.480 --> 20:18.200
<i>Well, that position.
Let's have the big chart.</i>

20:18.360 --> 20:20.320
<i>You won't find
that island on any chart.</i>

20:20.480 --> 20:23.240
That was made by the skipper
of a Norwegian bark.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.800
<i>- He must have been kidding.
- No, he wasn't.</i>

20:25.960 --> 20:30.280
Listen, a canoe full of natives from
this island was blown to sea.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.760
When the bark picked them,
there was one alive.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.800
He died before they reached port,
not before the skipper

20:35.960 --> 20:39.400
had a description of the island
and got an idea of where it lies.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.960
- Where did you get it?
- Singapore, two years ago.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.680
<i>Skipper knew I'd be interested.</i>

20:43.840 --> 20:47.160
<i>- Does he believe it?
- I don't know. But I do.</i>

20:47.320 --> 20:50.760
<i>Here. Here's what
the island looks like.</i>

20:54.520 --> 20:56.360
<i>There's a long, sandy peninsula.</i>

20:56.520 --> 20:59.280
The only possible landing place
is through this reef.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.320
<i>Rest of shoreline's sheer precipice,
hundreds of feet high.</i>

21:02.480 --> 21:05.120
And across the base
of the peninsula, cutting it off

21:05.280 --> 21:07.760
from the rest
of the island, is a wall.

21:08.320 --> 21:11.560
- A wall?
- Built long ago. People who lived there

21:11.720 --> 21:14.800
slipped back, forgotten
the high civilization that built it.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.520
That wall is as strong today
as it was centuries ago.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.160
The natives keep that wall in repair.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.320
- They need it.
- Why?

21:22.480 --> 21:26.000
<i>There's something on the other side
of it. Something they fear.</i>

21:26.200 --> 21:28.400
A hostile tribe.

21:35.160 --> 21:38.320
Did you ever hear of Kong?

21:40.440 --> 21:42.360
Why, yes.

21:42.520 --> 21:46.280
<i>Some native superstition, isn't it?
A god or a spirit or something.</i>

21:46.840 --> 21:49.400
Well, anyway,
neither beast nor man

21:49.560 --> 21:52.600
something monstrous,
all-powerful.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.320
Still living

21:54.480 --> 21:58.040
still holding that island
in a grip of deadly fear.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.560
Well, every legend
has a basis of truth.

22:03.720 --> 22:07.600
<i>I tell you, there's something on that
island that no white man has ever seen.</i>

22:07.760 --> 22:11.920
<i>- And you expect to photograph it?
- If it's there, you bet I'll photograph it.</i>

22:12.800 --> 22:15.440
<i>Suppose it doesn't like
having its picture taken?</i>

22:17.520 --> 22:21.800
Well, now you know why I brought
along those cases of gas bombs.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.880
<i>Oh, you've put on a beauty-and-beast
costume, eh?</i>

22:32.040 --> 22:33.960
<i>It's the prettiest.</i>

22:34.120 --> 22:37.120
All right. Just stand right over there.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.880
<i>I'm sort of nervous.
Suppose I don't photograph well?</i>

22:42.040 --> 22:45.120
<i>You don't have to worry about that.
If I hadn't been sure</i>

22:45.280 --> 22:47.960
<i>I wouldn't have brought you
around the world.</i>

22:48.200 --> 22:51.560
- What will I do?
- Well, we start with the profile.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.400
When I start cranking

22:53.560 --> 22:56.480
why, hold it a minute, and
then turn slowly toward me.

22:56.640 --> 23:00.200
You see me.
You smile a little, then you listen.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.120
Then you laugh. All right.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.840
Camera.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.760
<i>- Looks kind of silly, don't it?
- Pretty dame, huh?</i>

23:17.960 --> 23:20.040
You think maybe
he like to take my picture?

23:20.200 --> 23:23.520
<i>Them cameras cost money.
Shouldn't think he'd risk it.</i>

23:25.440 --> 23:28.440
<i>Now, that's fine, Ann.
Now we'll try one with a filter, eh?</i>

23:29.040 --> 23:31.040
Do you always take
the pictures yourself?

23:31.680 --> 23:33.640
Ever since a trip I made to Africa.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.400
<i>I'd have got a swell picture
of a charging rhino</i>

23:36.560 --> 23:38.080
but the cameraman got scared.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.880
The darned fool.
I was right there with a rifle.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.040
<i>Seems he didn't trust me to get
the rhino before it got him.</i>

23:44.200 --> 23:47.640
<i>I haven't fooled with a
cameramen since. I do it myself.</i>

23:47.800 --> 23:50.760
<i>- Think he's crazy, skipper?
- Just enthusiastic.</i>

23:51.160 --> 23:52.960
<i>Ann, in this one
you're looking down.</i>

23:53.160 --> 23:56.120
When I start to crank,
you look up slowly.

23:56.280 --> 23:59.200
<i>You're quite calm.
You don't expect to see a thing.</i>

23:59.360 --> 24:02.800
Then you just follow
my directions. All right?

24:04.080 --> 24:07.600
Camera. Look up slowly, Ann.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.960
<i>That's it. You don't see anything.</i>

24:11.120 --> 24:13.280
Now look higher

24:13.480 --> 24:15.920
still higher.

24:16.120 --> 24:19.680
<i>Now you see it. You're amazed.</i>

24:19.840 --> 24:23.760
<i>You can't believe it.
Your eyes open wider.</i>

24:23.960 --> 24:26.480
<i>It's horrible, Ann,
but you can't look away.</i>

24:26.640 --> 24:28.920
<i>There's no chance for you, Ann,
no escape.</i>

24:29.080 --> 24:31.000
<i>You're helpless, Ann, helpless.</i>

24:31.200 --> 24:33.880
<i>There's just one chance,
if you can scream</i>

24:34.040 --> 24:37.920
<i>but your throat's paralyzed.
Try to scream, Ann, try.</i>

24:38.080 --> 24:40.400
<i>Perhaps if you didn't see it,
you could scream.</i>

24:40.560 --> 24:44.960
Throw your arm across your eyes
and scream. Scream for your life.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.240
<i>What's he think
she's really gonna see?</i>

25:06.720 --> 25:10.360
This infernal fog.
Sure of your position, skipper?

25:10.520 --> 25:13.320
Last night before this fog shut down,
I got a good sight.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.240
We should be near the island.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.240
<i>If we don't see it when this fog lifts,
we never will.</i>

25:18.400 --> 25:19.840
<i>We've quartered these parts.</i>

25:20.320 --> 25:22.000
<i>Can't see your hand in front of your face.</i>

25:22.160 --> 25:25.120
<i>Hey, Charlie, I wish you'd make
your soup as thick as this.</i>

25:28.840 --> 25:31.840
No bottom at 30.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.120
<i>The Norwegian skipper must've
been guessing at the position.</i>

25:35.280 --> 25:36.920
<i>How will we know
it's the right island?</i>

25:37.080 --> 25:41.360
<i>- The mountain that looks like a skull.
- Oh, yes, I'd forgotten. You told me.</i>

25:41.520 --> 25:44.640
- Skull Mountain.
- By the deep 20.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.160
Shallowing fast.
Mr. Briggs, dead slow.

25:47.320 --> 25:49.280
Dead slow, sir.

25:49.440 --> 25:53.120
- Confound this fog.
- By the deep 16.

25:53.320 --> 25:56.240
<i>- What'd she draw, skipper?
- Four.</i>

25:56.400 --> 25:58.560
<i>Why don't he
heave to until it clears?</i>

25:58.720 --> 26:02.400
<i>'Tain't the old man.
It's that crazy guy, Denham.</i>

26:02.680 --> 26:05.560
Listen, you hear anything?

26:05.760 --> 26:07.600
No.

26:07.800 --> 26:12.200
- Breakers ahead.
- Let go.

26:17.600 --> 26:21.400
<i>That's not breakers. That's drums.</i>

26:39.720 --> 26:42.200
<i>Skipper, now the fog's lifted,
do you see anybody?</i>

26:42.360 --> 26:45.360
<i>- Not a living thing.
- Funny they haven't spotted us.</i>

26:45.760 --> 26:49.040
<i>I'd think the whole population
would be on the beach.</i>

26:49.240 --> 26:50.840
Listen.

26:55.400 --> 26:58.800
Maybe they have spotted us
and are signaling.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.040
Well, skipper, do you believe me now?
There it is.

27:02.440 --> 27:04.040
Skull Mountain, the wall.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.360
Everything just like
on my funny little map.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.000
<i>- Come on. Let's get started.
- All right.</i>

27:09.160 --> 27:11.400
Twelve men go with you.
The rest stay aboard.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.720
Have you got a good man
with those gas bombs?

27:14.880 --> 27:16.440
I think you better go along.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.680
You may be able to talk
to these birds.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.360
All right. Mr. Adams.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.240
Aye, sir.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.920
<i>- You'll take charge of the ship.
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

27:25.080 --> 27:28.240
<i>- I'm going ashore with you, aren't I?
- You bet.</i>

27:28.400 --> 27:30.800
<i>I don't think she should
until we know what's there.</i>

27:30.960 --> 27:32.760
<i>Wait a minute.
Who's running this show?</i>

27:32.920 --> 27:36.080
I found out from experience to
keep my cast and cameras with me.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.240
<i>You never can tell
when you'll want them.</i>

27:38.400 --> 27:40.080
<i>- But you're crazy to risk...
- Jack</i>

27:40.240 --> 27:42.680
run along and get
the rifles and ammunition.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.320
And get me a couple of huskies
to carry my stuff.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.560
<i>And, Jack, don't forget
the costume box.</i>

27:47.760 --> 27:51.160
<i>If we're lucky enough,
we may get a swell shot right away.</i>

27:51.320 --> 27:52.880
Come on, Ann.

27:56.280 --> 27:58.480
<i>All right, boys, let's go.</i>

27:58.640 --> 28:00.920
- Take it easy with that camera.
- Okay.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.480
- Plenty of ammunition for those guns?
- Yes, sir.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.640
Be careful with those bombs.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.680
<i>All right, Briggs, now we'll get
a look at Denham's island.</i>

28:10.200 --> 28:12.720
Stand by to lower away.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.840
You with the camera,
stick close.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.520
<i>- Okay.
- Who's got the bombs?</i>

28:49.720 --> 28:51.160
- I have, sir.
- Watch your step.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.920
<i>There's enough trichloride
to put hippos to sleep.</i>

28:54.120 --> 28:55.680
Aye, aye, sir.

28:55.840 --> 28:59.640
- What queer-looking boats.
- Yeah, outrigger canoes.

29:00.040 --> 29:02.720
Driscoll, I want two men left here
to guard the boat.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.720
- All attended to, sir.
- Good.

29:04.880 --> 29:08.000
We all ready, then?
Come on.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.520
Not a soul in sight.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.560
The people must all
be gathered up ahead.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.840
That wall, skipper.
What do you think of that?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.640
Colossal.
It might almost be Egyptian.

29:26.800 --> 29:29.560
<i>But what's on the other side
of that wall? I wanna know.</i>

29:29.760 --> 29:32.200
Who do you suppose
could have built it?

29:32.360 --> 29:34.360
Oh, I was up on Angkor once.

29:34.560 --> 29:37.480
<i>That's bigger than this,
and nobody knows who built it.</i>

29:37.640 --> 29:41.200
Oh, boy, what a chance.
What a picture.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.960
Come on.

29:56.120 --> 29:59.200
<i>Hear that?
They're saying, "Kong, Kong."</i>

29:59.360 --> 30:01.160
Hope you talk
their lingo, skipper.

30:01.320 --> 30:03.720
<i>- You catch any words yet?
- I'm not sure.</i>

30:03.880 --> 30:06.800
Sounds something like the language
Nias Islanders speak.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.520
What do you suppose is happening?

30:08.680 --> 30:10.800
<i>They're up to some
of their heathen tricks.</i>

30:10.960 --> 30:12.600
<i>But don't go rushing out to sea.</i>

30:12.760 --> 30:15.520
<i>- All right. But isn't it exciting?
- Sure.</i>

30:15.680 --> 30:19.280
<i>- I wish we'd left you on the ship.
- Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.</i>

30:19.480 --> 30:23.000
Wait. Easy, now.
Wait till I see what goes on.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.840
Holy mackerel! What a show.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.680
Hey, skipper, come here
and get a load of this.

30:43.320 --> 30:46.200
Did you ever see anything
like that before in your life?

31:31.720 --> 31:34.400
Boy, if I could only get
a picture before they see us.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.280
Hey, you with the camera.
Come here.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.240
I wanna see.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.160
Come on, but be careful.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.680
<i>- Too late. They see us.
- Let's... Let's beat it.</i>

32:08.840 --> 32:12.040
- Hey, what are you running for?
- No use trying to hide now.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.680
Everybody come out in plain sight.

32:49.680 --> 32:53.400
<i>- Say, let's scram out of here.
- Stand still, you fool.</i>

32:53.600 --> 32:56.280
Steady, boys, bluff them.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.440
Come on, skipper.
Make him a friendly speech.

33:28.760 --> 33:31.200
<i>He understands you, skipper.
What's he say?</i>

33:31.360 --> 33:34.360
<i>- He's telling us to get out.
- Well, talk him out of it.</i>

33:34.520 --> 33:36.680
Ask him what goes on.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.120
He says the girl there
is the bride of Kong.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.960
<i>Great. Find out
what they're gonna do.</i>

34:05.600 --> 34:08.320
<i>- What's that?
- He must be the witch doctor.</i>

34:08.480 --> 34:11.159
<i>He says the ceremony is spoiled
because we've seen it.</i>

34:11.320 --> 34:14.320
<i>Well, calm the old boy down.
What's the word for friend?</i>

34:25.360 --> 34:28.000
Steady with those rifles, boys.

34:34.560 --> 34:38.400
<i>- What's that?
- He says, look at the golden woman.</i>

34:38.560 --> 34:40.800
Yeah. Blonds are scarce
around here.

34:49.199 --> 34:52.679
- A gift for Kong, he says.
- Good Lord!

34:56.560 --> 34:58.560
Wants to buy her.

35:04.480 --> 35:07.440
<i>He's offering to trade
six of his women for Ann.</i>

35:09.080 --> 35:11.160
You got her into this, Denham.

35:21.960 --> 35:23.680
<i>I'm gonna take her
back to the ship.</i>

35:23.880 --> 35:26.760
<i>We'd better get out of here
before they think to cut us off.</i>

35:26.960 --> 35:29.920
<i>Guess so. But tell him we'll be back
tomorrow to make friends.</i>

35:35.800 --> 35:40.240
<i>Get going, Ann. Don't be scared.
Everything's all right.</i>

35:41.280 --> 35:43.720
Smile, Ann, and talk to Jack.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.640
Keep your chin up.

36:09.160 --> 36:13.840
<i>- Say, why aren't you in bed?
- Oh, I can't sleep.</i>

36:14.000 --> 36:17.760
The sound of those drums
makes me nervous, I guess.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.880
<i>I think Denham's off his nut
taking you ashore today.</i>

36:21.040 --> 36:22.440
Well, I was a little scared.

36:23.880 --> 36:28.160
<i>- I guess you weren't the only one.
- I wonder what we do next.</i>

36:28.320 --> 36:29.920
<i>That's just what's worrying me.</i>

36:30.080 --> 36:32.800
<i>Denham's a fool,
there's no telling what he might</i>

36:32.960 --> 36:34.720
ask you to do for this picture.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.440
<i>After all he's done,
I would take any chance for him.</i>

36:37.600 --> 36:39.240
<i>Don't talk like that.</i>

36:39.400 --> 36:41.760
<i>I'd say he's crazy enough
to try anything.</i>

36:41.920 --> 36:44.480
<i>Well, I won't go back on him.</i>

36:44.640 --> 36:49.000
<i>When I think of what might've happened
today, if anything had happened to you...</i>

36:49.200 --> 36:51.960
<i>Then you wouldn't be bothered
having a woman onboard.</i>

36:52.160 --> 36:55.840
<i>Don't laugh. I'm scared for you.</i>

36:56.000 --> 37:00.040
<i>I'm sort of...
Well, I'm scared of you too.</i>

37:00.240 --> 37:01.800
Ann...

37:02.800 --> 37:04.120
I...

37:07.880 --> 37:09.760
Say...

37:09.920 --> 37:12.880
I guess I love you.

37:13.040 --> 37:16.120
Why, Jack, you hate women.

37:16.840 --> 37:19.760
<i>Yeah, I know.
But you aren't women.</i>

37:21.640 --> 37:23.520
Say, Ann...

37:23.680 --> 37:26.200
<i>I don't suppose...</i>

37:26.400 --> 37:28.320
I mean...

37:28.480 --> 37:32.560
<i>Well, you don't feel anything
like that about me</i>

37:33.240 --> 37:35.040
do you?

37:42.320 --> 37:44.720
Mr. Driscoll, are you on deck?

37:46.920 --> 37:48.760
Yes, sir.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.960
Will you please
come up on the bridge?

37:54.480 --> 37:56.640
<i>You go on. I'll wait here.</i>

38:00.800 --> 38:02.400
Yes, sir.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.520
<i>There, that's about it.</i>

39:20.680 --> 39:23.080
<i>We'll make absolutely sure
tomorrow noon.</i>

39:23.240 --> 39:26.200
Oh, must be almost midnight.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.360
Hey.

39:28.520 --> 39:30.280
Look at that.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.640
Torches going through the village.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.440
Yeah, looks like the night
before election.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.160
<i>Listen to them. Wonder what's up.</i>

39:41.600 --> 39:43.520
Wish I could take pictures
by firelight.

39:43.680 --> 39:46.520
<i>- I'd sneak ashore and get a scene now.
- Oh, be sensible.</i>

39:46.680 --> 39:48.840
<i>We're lucky to be all safe
aboard tonight.</i>

39:49.040 --> 39:51.040
Yeah, I guess so.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.400
- Charlie, have you seen missy?
- Me no see one, two hours.

40:01.560 --> 40:04.720
When we leave this place?
Me no like.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.760
Ann.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.760
Ann.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.040
All hands on deck!
Everybody on deck!

40:35.200 --> 40:37.440
Everybody on deck!
All hands on deck!

40:37.600 --> 40:40.520
Everybody on deck!
Everybody on deck!

40:40.680 --> 40:43.320
<i>- What's the matter? What's happening?
- What's going on?</i>

40:44.800 --> 40:46.880
<i>- What's the matter?
- I'm out here.</i>

40:55.000 --> 40:56.480
Look, sir. Me find on deck.

40:56.640 --> 40:59.440
- A native bracelet.
- Crazy black man been here.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.400
What is it?
Who turned out the crew?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.600
<i>- Look. Someone's been aboard.
- Where's Ann?</i>

41:03.760 --> 41:06.720
<i>- In her cabin.
- No, she isn't. I just looked.</i>

41:07.000 --> 41:10.400
<i>- What's the matter, Mr. Driscoll?
- Search the ship. Find Miss Darrow.</i>

41:10.560 --> 41:13.400
Aye, aye.

41:13.560 --> 41:17.200
- Ann. Oh, Ann. Did you see her?
- No.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.240
<i>I'll look below.</i>

41:24.280 --> 41:26.400
<i>- Did you find her?
- Can't find her forward.</i>

41:26.560 --> 41:28.840
<i>- She's not below.
- Can't find her aft.</i>

41:29.040 --> 41:30.240
<i>Ann's gone!</i>

41:31.360 --> 41:34.200
Serve out the rifles. Man the boats.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.760
Take this ammunition outside.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.680
Come on, you fellas.
Grab these guns.

41:39.880 --> 41:42.640
Take these bomb cases
and be careful with them.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.120
Pass those rifles up over the side.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.720
Start packing those bombs.

41:50.360 --> 41:52.320
Me likey go too.
Me likey catch missy.

41:52.480 --> 41:55.520
This is no job for a cook.
Get out of here. Come on.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.360
<i>Shove her off, men.
We're going over the side.</i>

41:59.040 --> 42:01.440
Give way, gentlemen.
Right over there.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.160
<i>They've taken Ann.</i>

48:11.200 --> 48:15.040
Hurry. Hurry up.
She must be up ahead here.

48:15.200 --> 48:16.800
- Come on, men.
- Come on, boys.

48:16.960 --> 48:18.560
Has anybody seen her?
Come on.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.240
Get this gate open. Quick!

48:46.880 --> 48:49.640
Get up there, men.
Pull that thing back!

48:49.800 --> 48:52.080
<i>Pull that bar back.
He's got Ann.</i>

48:52.280 --> 48:55.000
Heave. Heave.

48:56.120 --> 48:58.520
Heave. Heave.

48:58.680 --> 49:00.520
<i>- Who's going with me?
- I'll go.</i>

49:07.280 --> 49:09.600
You stay with half the men
and guard the gate.

49:09.760 --> 49:12.280
<i>- Don't let them close it.
- We'll take care of it.</i>

49:55.320 --> 49:57.960
No telling which way
he went in this darkness.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.480
<i>He's been through here.</i>

49:59.680 --> 50:03.120
- Look at these broken branches.
- Yeah, look at that. Keep up, fellas.

50:04.840 --> 50:06.760
It ought to be sunup about now.

50:06.920 --> 50:10.000
Yeah, just listen to those birds.

50:10.160 --> 50:12.480
<i>It's dawn all right.</i>

50:12.640 --> 50:15.960
<i>- What's that?
- Holy mackerel!</i>

50:16.120 --> 50:18.840
<i>Yeah, that's his track.
Look at the size of that thing.</i>

50:19.040 --> 50:20.560
He must be as big as a house.

50:20.720 --> 50:22.080
<i>He's headed this way.</i>

50:22.240 --> 50:24.640
Come on, fellas, and keep
those guns cocked.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.800
Hate to have that thing
wrapped around me.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.760
<i>Here's another one.
We're on his trail.</i>

50:37.960 --> 50:41.160
Sure, sure. I know that.
Come on. Come on, fellas.

50:45.600 --> 50:47.360
Hey, look at that!

50:48.440 --> 50:50.960
<i>Keep quiet.
He doesn't see us.</i>

50:57.720 --> 50:59.920
Give me one of those bombs.

51:12.960 --> 51:15.080
<i>Look, it's gonna charge.</i>

51:22.800 --> 51:24.720
Keep quiet.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.560
Come on.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.960
Give him another one.

51:54.480 --> 51:55.800
Look out!

52:16.040 --> 52:18.600
<i>Look out. He's still alive.</i>

52:18.760 --> 52:20.480
Shoot.

52:26.880 --> 52:28.920
Come on. That got him.

52:35.240 --> 52:36.800
What do you call this thing?

52:37.000 --> 52:39.640
Why, something
from the dinosaur family.

52:39.840 --> 52:41.640
Dinosaur, eh?

52:41.800 --> 52:43.320
Yes, Jack

52:43.520 --> 52:46.080
a prehistoric beast.

52:49.400 --> 52:52.880
Say, just look at the length
of that brute.

52:54.760 --> 52:58.040
If I could only bring back
one of these alive.

52:58.200 --> 53:01.800
<i>- Watch that tail! He's still alive.
- Come on, looks like he's standing up.</i>

53:02.000 --> 53:04.160
<i>He's through. Come on.</i>

53:04.320 --> 53:07.160
Come on, men.

53:09.520 --> 53:11.600
Boy, one swipe of that.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.680
- Hear that?
- Yeah. What is it?

53:28.840 --> 53:31.000
<i>That's him, boys. Come on.</i>

53:44.120 --> 53:46.920
<i>Here. Here's his mark again.</i>

53:47.520 --> 53:50.520
<i>- There's water ahead.
- He's down in that fog somewhere.</i>

53:52.160 --> 53:54.240
<i>Yes, that's him splashing through.
Come on.</i>

53:54.400 --> 53:55.720
Be careful.

54:02.360 --> 54:05.920
Now, watch the step-off, boys.

54:06.080 --> 54:07.400
Must have swum across.

54:07.600 --> 54:10.760
<i>Yeah, it'll be tough for us
with these guns and bombs.</i>

54:10.920 --> 54:13.400
- What about these logs for a raft?
- Good idea.

54:13.600 --> 54:14.920
Come, fellas. Get busy.

54:15.080 --> 54:18.240
Put those guns down
on the bank and get going.

54:20.040 --> 54:21.480
Move!

54:21.640 --> 54:23.440
Come on with those poles.

54:23.600 --> 54:25.720
All set, everybody?

54:26.720 --> 54:28.440
Shove off!

54:51.040 --> 54:54.640
<i>- Hear anything?
- No, he's miles away by now.</i>

54:54.800 --> 54:57.840
<i>We'll be able to pick up
his trail all right.</i>

55:10.480 --> 55:11.880
Listen.

55:25.520 --> 55:27.200
Quiet.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.200
What was it?

55:44.680 --> 55:46.560
Hang on, men.

55:55.640 --> 55:58.160
Look out. Here he comes.

57:14.960 --> 57:16.720
Come on.

58:52.320 --> 58:54.240
Come on.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.400
Hey, Jack. Jack Driscoll.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.040
- Hey, Jack.
- Denham.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.000
<i>- It didn't get you, huh?
- No, I got to cover, same as you.</i>

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.080
<i>- Think we're safe?
- There are two of us</i>

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.240
<i>left alive to save her.
- I can't get across now.</i>

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.680
<i>Don't want you to.
Lam back and get more bombs.</i>

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.600
<i>Why, you wouldn't follow
that beast alone.</i>

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.880
<i>Someone's gotta stay on his trail.</i>

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.680
<i>I'll get a chance,
sneak her away.</i>

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.520
<i>I'll figure a way to signal you
where he's taken her.</i>

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.320
<i>- I guess that's our only out.
- Sure it is. Get going.</i>

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.720
<i>Don't get killed
till you see Englehorn.</i>

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.520
Okay, Jack. Good luck.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.720
Skipper, this Kong
is the biggest thing in the world.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.400
He shook those men off that log
like they were flies.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:04.240
<i>All those men lost.
It's incredible.</i>

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.960
<i>Driscoll said he'd try and signal us
if he found Ann.</i>

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.560
<i>- We'll never see them again.
- Don't give up.</i>

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.160
<i>- There's chance for Driscoll.
- Wait for daylight.</i>

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.800
<i>We'll bridge the ravine.
Where's that case of bombs?</i>

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.600
- Here, sir.
- This...

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:20.200
<i>This monster you've seen,
you think your bombs will stop him?</i>

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:23.640
<i>If we can get close enough
to use them, you bet they'll stop him.</i>

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.520
- Had any trouble with the natives?
- Yes, after you left.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.680
- What happened?
- We fired volleys over

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.920
their heads,
they ran like rabbits.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.600
<i>Gunpowder's new
in their lives?</i>

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.800
<i>- They're terrified.
- They haven't shown up.</i>

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.279
Take a man on the wall,
keep your eyes peeled.

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:39.600
We leave at dawn,
if we get a signal or not.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.040
Yes, sir.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.920
Hey, look.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.240
Hey, below, Mr. Denham.
Captain Englehorn.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.000
<i>Mr. Driscoll and the lady,
they're coming back.</i>

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.400
Come on, fellas.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.400
Are you both all right?

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.040
Pint, Jack. Here.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.680
<i>I'm all right.</i>

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.840
What happened? How did you do it?

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.040
- Came down the river.
- Oh, Jack.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.800
<i>There, there, you're safe now.</i>

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.680
<i>We'll have you back on the ship
in no time.</i>

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.240
Wait a minute. What about Kong?

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.360
Well, what about him?

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.920
We came to get a movie,
and we found something worth

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.400
more than all the movies in the world.
- What?

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.120
<i>We've got those gas bombs.</i>

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.400
<i>- Lf we can capture him alive...
- Why, you're crazy.</i>

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.600
<i>He's on a cliff
where a whole army</i>

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.080
<i>couldn't get at him.
- Yeah, if he stays there</i>

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:52.080
<i>but we've got
something he wants.</i>

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:55.200
<i>Yeah, something
he won't get again.</i>

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.680
<i>Hey, look out. It's Kong.
Kong's coming.</i>

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:26.480
Come around. Come here
and hold the gates. Quick.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:30.160
- Denham, natives are coming.
- Good work. Come on.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.400
Hey, come back
with those bombs, you...

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:08.640
Come on. Come on. I got him.

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.200
<i>He'll be out for hours.
Send to the ship.</i>

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.840
- For anchor chains and tools.
- What will you do?

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.520
A raft to float him to the ship.
The whole world will pay to see this.

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:21.680
<i>- No chains will hold that.
- We'll give him more than chains.</i>

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.040
<i>He's always been king of his world,
but we'll teach him fear.</i>

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.080
<i>We're millionaires, boys.
I'll share it with all of you.</i>

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.880
<i>In a few months,
it'll be up in lights on Broadway:</i>

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:35.000
<i>"Kong, the Eighth Wonder
of the World."</i>

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.120
<i>Say, what's Denham got anyway?</i>

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.880
It better be good
after all this ballyhoo.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.200
Heavens, what a mob.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.240
Well, you would come.
These tickets cost me 20 bucks.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.800
<i>I can't sit so near the screen.
It hurts my eyes.</i>

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.680
This is not a moving picture,
madam.

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.440
What? Mr. Denham
makes those pictures

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.000
of those darling monkeys
and tigers and things.

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.600
This is in the nature
of a personal appearance.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:31.240
Well, I never. I thought
I was gonna see something.

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.880
<i>- Say, what is it anyhow?
- I hear it's a kind of a gorilla.</i>

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:37.840
<i>Gee, ain't we got enough
of them in New York?</i>

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.120
<i>I don't like to look at him.</i>

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.840
It makes me think
of that awful day on the island.

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:51.560
<i>I wouldn't have brought you,
but you know how Denham insisted.</i>

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:54.240
We had to come
when he said it would help the show.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.480
<i>Do you think we'll
make a lot of money?</i>

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.680
Well, enough to pay him back
for these clothes anyway.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:03.360
<i>It's the first time I ever had on
one of these open-front suits.</i>

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:06.360
Hello, there. Just in time.
Gee, Ann, you look great.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.120
<i>I'm glad I dressed you up for this show.
Well, Jack, $ 10,000 in the box office.</i>

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.720
<i>- Not bad for one night.
- That's a lot of money.</i>

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:15.560
<i>We're gonna do that every night.</i>

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.360
<i>- Look at the size of that.
- I hope he's tied up tight.</i>

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:21.880
<i>Sure he is.
Denham's taking no chances.</i>

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.000
Here are the press.
Come in, boys.

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:26.640
- This is Ms. Darrow and Mr. Driscoll.
- How do you do?

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.760
Mr. Driscoll saved you from the ape?

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:32.480
Yes. He was alone too.
All the sailors with him had been killed.

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:36.240
- How did you ever tackle that baby?
- Well, Mr. Denham got him.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.520
The rest of us
were running scared.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:41.000
He had the nerve
to stand there and chuck bombs.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.680
<i>Oh, so you're the hero.
Come on, give us a story.</i>

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.120
Here now, wait a minute.
Lay off me, boys.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.920
<i>Miss Darrow is the story.
If it hadn't been for her</i>

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.960
<i>we couldn't have gotten near Kong.
He followed her.</i>

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.280
<i>- Beauty and the beast, huh?
- That's it.</i>

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.640
Play up that angle,
beauty and the beast.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.600
Kong could have stayed safe

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.760
<i>but he couldn't stay away
from beauty.</i>

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:03.720
<i>- That's your story, boys.
- That's a lead story, all right.</i>

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.840
- How about some pictures?
- Just a minute.

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.880
Come on the stage. Take pictures
in front of the audience.

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.560
<i>I'll make a speech and tell them
about Kong, Darrow</i>

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.320
Driscoll. When I call you,
come take pictures.

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.080
<i>- Okay.
- That's fine.</i>

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:17.880
Stand by, Ann, when I call you.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.520
<i>Now, now, it's all right.</i>

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.760
<i>We've knocked some of the fight
out of him since you saw him.</i>

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:43.040
Ladies and gentlemen, I am here tonight
to tell you a very strange story.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:46.120
A story so strange that no one
will believe it.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.720
But, ladies and gentlemen,
seeing is believing

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.720
and we, my partners and I

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.480
have brought back the living proof
of our adventure.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.600
... an adventure in which 12
of our party met horrible deaths.

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.000
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
before I tell you any more

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.480
I am going to show you the greatest
thing your eyes ever beheld.

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.200
He was a king and a god
in the world he knew

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.200
but now he comes to civilization
merely a captive

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.000
a show to gratify your curiosity.

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:20.520
Ladies and gentlemen, look at Kong.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.560
The Eighth Wonder of the World.

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.760
And now I want to introduce
Miss Ann Darrow

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.880
the bravest girl
I have ever known.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.000
There the beast
and here the beauty.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.720
She has lived through an experience
no other woman ever dreamed of.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.560
And she was saved from the very grasp
of Kong by her future husband.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:12.880
I want you to meet a very brave
gentleman, Mr. John Driscoll.

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.680
And now before I tell you
the full story of our voyage

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:29.800
I will ask the gentlemen
of the press to come forward

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:33.480
so that the audience may see them
take the first photographs

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.520
of Kong and his captors.

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:38.320
All right, boys.

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:47.480
Miss Darrow first, alone.
Stand in front of Kong, Ann.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.920
- All set? Make it a good one.
- Okay.

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.400
Shoot.

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:07.160
<i>Don't be alarmed. Those chains
are made of chrome steel.</i>

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:14.000
<i>- It's all right, Ann.
- Get them together, boys.</i>

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.640
<i>- They're going to be married tomorrow.
- Put your arm around her, Driscoll.</i>

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.720
Wait a minute. Hold on.

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:25.080
<i>- He thinks you're attacking the girl.
- All the roaring, swell picture.</i>

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.440
<i>Come on, it's loose!</i>

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:29.720
Send the riot squad and ambulances.
Kong has escaped.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.040
<i>You're safe now, dear.</i>

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:43.160
<i>It's like a horrible dream.</i>

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:46.320
<i>It's like being back
on the island again.</i>

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.280
<i>Now, it's all right. Don't worry.</i>

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:51.920
<i>I'm gonna stay right here with you.</i>

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.800
<i>Anyhow, you know
they're bound to get him.</i>

01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:55.880
<i>Jack, he's climbing up
outside there.</i>

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:58.440
<i>- He's got Ann. He's taken her up.
- The roof, quick.</i>

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.960
Ann, Ann!

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.120
<i>How can we follow him?
What'll we do?</i>

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.680
Fire department searchlights
on the roof.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.200
<i>Yeah, they'll keep him in sight.</i>

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:02.480
<i>Attention all stations.
Kong is going west.</i>

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.840
<i>He is making for
the Empire State Building.</i>

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:07.600
<i>Stand by for further reports.</i>

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:11.040
<i>- Lf he goes up there, what can we do?
- We won't get near him.</i>

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.760
<i>Kong is climbing
the Empire State Building.</i>

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:16.600
<i>He is still carrying Ann Darrow.
That is all.</i>

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:18.520
That licks us.

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:20.600
<i>- One thing we haven't thought of.
- What?</i>

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.960
Airplanes. If he should put
Ann down

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.440
and they fly close
to pick him without her...

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.120
<i>You're right. Planes.</i>

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:29.000
Call the field.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:05.520
<i>- Here come the planes.
- They'll get him.</i>

01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:11.000
<i>- Can they shoot him and not hit Ann?
- They'll be shooting.</i>

01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:57.560
Ann. Ann, hang on, dear.

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.840
- Ann, are you all right?
- Jack!

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:19.280
Just a moment. Wait a minute.

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:21.320
Let me through.
My name is Denham.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.880
Just a moment. Oh, lieutenant.

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.800
<i>- Lieutenant, I'm Carl Denham.
- Carl Denham.</i>

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:29.680
<i>Denham? Oh, that's the man
that captured the monster.</i>

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:36.360
Well, Denham, the airplanes got him.

01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:41.400
<i>Oh, no, it wasn't the airplanes.</i>

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:44.640
It was beauty killed the beast.
