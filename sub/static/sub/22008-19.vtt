00:02.085 --> 00:04.953
<i>- Previously on</i> The Blacklist:
- I'll make this simple.

00:05.422 --> 00:08.631
I have the suitcase.
And because I have the suitcase...

00:08.800 --> 00:10.883
...I need to speak with Reddington.

00:11.053 --> 00:14.012
I'm going to honor Tom's dying wish.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.639
- Which was?
- For me to know your truth.

00:16.808 --> 00:19.141
You have the bones, you know the truth.

00:19.311 --> 00:22.395
A truth. I want the whole truth.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.806
- What about Keen?
- Utter her name again...

00:24.983 --> 00:26.724
...I'll cut out your tongue.

00:26.902 --> 00:29.645
You have no idea who I am
or why I want the truth.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.483
Tell me again. I need to hear it.

00:31.657 --> 00:34.866
<i>I promise Ian Garvey
will not get away from me.</i>

00:35.369 --> 00:38.908
My name is Elizabeth Keen.
I'm a special agent with the FBI.

00:39.081 --> 00:41.038
I know what it's like...

00:41.208 --> 00:44.576
- ...to have a father who's a criminal.
- Ian isn't my father.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.585
He protected me from my father.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.919
Perhaps you've heard of him.
Name's Raymond Reddington.

01:23.125 --> 01:26.209
Ian Garvey is...
How do you Americans say it?

01:26.378 --> 01:28.290
...a dead man walking.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.579
I cut him off.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.841
He no longer represents
my interests in your country.

01:34.011 --> 01:37.595
He knows why and what he must do
to regain your patronage?

01:38.098 --> 01:41.262
Yes. He was not happy about it.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.927
Unhappiness motivates whimpering.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.562
Action is motivated by fear.

01:46.732 --> 01:49.395
Garvey has made a lot of money
distributing my product...

01:49.568 --> 01:51.434
...protecting my supply lines.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.729
I am the source
of his wealth and power.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.943
<i>He fears the loss of our alliance...</i>

01:57.117 --> 01:59.609
<i>...and is quite motivated to get it back.</i>

01:59.786 --> 02:03.200
Then he'll bring me what I need
and your debt will be paid.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.739
As the Gospels say:

02:04.916 --> 02:08.080
Render unto Caesar the things
that are Caesar's...

02:08.252 --> 02:11.872
...and unto Reddington
the things that are Reddington's.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.507
As the Russians say, "Trust but verify."

02:15.177 --> 02:18.420
Having saved your son from those
who suspect you work...

02:18.597 --> 02:21.635
...with American intelligence,
I'm sure you wouldn't want them...

02:21.808 --> 02:23.595
...to see photos proving that you do.

02:24.186 --> 02:28.806
Goodness knows, the next time
they take your son, I may not be in Paris.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.441
As you say, fear is a great motivator.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.691
I'll contact you with a time and place.

02:35.864 --> 02:40.905
When I get the bag, you get the photos,
and Garvey gets your good graces.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.570
<i>- Everybody wins.
- This bag...</i>

02:43.747 --> 02:47.206
...it must contain something
quite extraordinary.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.659
Extraordinarily human.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.829
Nothing more, nothing less.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.887
<i>- So?</i>
- Reddington knows too much.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.180
About both of us.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.440
- He believed your story?
<i>- Of course.</i>

03:12.901 --> 03:15.644
He lives in a world
where people do what he tells them.

03:15.821 --> 03:20.532
- So he expects me to bring him the bag.
- When you do, I expect you to kill him.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.284
I have questions I need him to answer.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.365
More than you need my support?

03:26.915 --> 03:28.201
No.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.742
Then the answers die with him.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.227
I'm good.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.530
- I have a daughter. Her name is Agnes.
- I wanna go home.

04:05.704 --> 04:09.038
She's with her grandmother
until it's safe to come back.

04:09.207 --> 04:12.371
- Am I free to go?
- It won't be safe until Garvey is in prison.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.831
- That a yes or no?
- I didn't force you to stay.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.587
I forced you to listen.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.170
I needed you to hear
that Garvey killed my husband.

04:20.302 --> 04:23.966
Right here!
Right where I'm standing now.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.678
I always fantasized about having a sister.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.179
Someone who I could be
completely honest with...

04:33.356 --> 04:36.190
...because I know she would be
completely honest with me.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.523
I am being completely honest with you.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.275
Ian is my surrogate father.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.406
He taught me to drive.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.818
He showed up to my graduation.

04:47.579 --> 04:51.323
He was there
after my real father abandoned me.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.701
And you want me
to help you arrest him.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.625
- I do.
- What if it was Reddington?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.539
Would you arrest him?

04:59.716 --> 05:02.675
You're an FBI agent,
he's on your Most Wanted list.

05:02.844 --> 05:07.179
Be honest. If you knew where he was
right now, would you arrest him?

05:07.724 --> 05:09.386
It isn't the same thing.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.218
Right.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.772
Like I said, it was a fantasy.

05:28.787 --> 05:33.452
I wish we could just forget all of this...

05:34.751 --> 05:36.617
...and get to know one another.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.713
I think we both know
it's a little late for that.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.600
After more than two decades
on your Most Wanted list...

05:56.773 --> 05:59.356
...I've become something of an FBI buff.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.392
I know all about your Wacos.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.732
Your Ruby Ridges. COINTELPRO.

06:03.905 --> 06:08.240
Going all the way back to John Dillinger,
Al Capone, all those communists.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.777
The incorruptible G-man.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.947
A colorless, if admirably professional, lot.

06:14.124 --> 06:17.208
Is there a case hidden
in that backhanded compliment?

06:17.961 --> 06:19.327
This apartment.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.211
Right here.

06:21.381 --> 06:27.127
My God, to have been the proverbial fly
on Clyde Tolson's duvet.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.966
Clyde Tolson lived here?

06:29.681 --> 06:33.049
- J. Edgar Hoover's lover?
- This was their secret hideaway.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.309
Imagine the conversations.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.686
Cooing over JFK's lovers.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.688
Slandering Dr. King.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.100
What peignoir to wear to bed.

06:42.277 --> 06:45.361
When I saw the apartment for sale,
I couldn't resist.

06:45.530 --> 06:49.069
You own the apartment
where the homophobic head of the FBI...

06:49.242 --> 06:51.575
...carried on his affair with his boyfriend?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.954
Allegedly. I wouldn't admit this
in mixed company...

06:55.123 --> 06:58.457
...but J. Edgar and I have
a surprising amount in common.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.415
For instance,
we both always get our man.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.954
He got Tolson.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.747
I got Garvey.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.339
- Or I will, by this time tomorrow.
- Is this why you wanted to see me?

07:08.511 --> 07:12.255
Mosadek has ordered Garvey
to bring me the duffel bag.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.391
Garvey thinks he'll give it to me
and walk away.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.473
I wanted to tell you
I've made other arrangements.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.434
To get your man and the bag.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.816
To get our man and keep my privacy.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.147
Hoover believed knowledge is power.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.313
He used his to hurt
a lot of good people.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.233
- You're using yours to hurt me.
- That's ridiculous.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.025
Tom died for a reason.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.490
You know why and you won't tell me.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.907
I won't tell you something
that's none of your business.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.121
That was none of Tom's business.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.206
You may feel entitled to know...

07:43.380 --> 07:47.624
...because he died trying to figure out
what it was, but you're not.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.545
A fact which I have patiently tried
to get you to understand.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.214
Be hurt. Blame me.
Howl at the moon for all I care.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.725
But this is my problem...

07:57.894 --> 07:59.681
...not yours.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.893
Hey. What's the matter?

08:07.696 --> 08:09.403
Are you like him?

08:09.572 --> 08:11.154
Like who?

08:11.324 --> 08:12.610
Reddington.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.241
Are you like him?

08:15.412 --> 08:19.247
- You know the answer to that.
- I know about the Nash Syndicate.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.286
- About Zarak Mosadek.
- There's an explanation for all of that.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.415
You saved me.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.626
You protected me.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.717
I don't know who you've been talking to,
but what matters...

08:36.890 --> 08:39.224
This matters to me, Ian.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.179
This matters to me.

08:41.895 --> 08:45.014
You don't need to be protected
from him anymore.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.270
Not after tomorrow.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.399
Are you gonna kill him?

08:51.906 --> 08:54.114
Like you killed Tom Keen.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.324
So that's who you've been talking to?

08:59.497 --> 09:01.113
Agent Keen?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.041
Are you gonna kill Reddington?

09:07.547 --> 09:10.415
Hey. You gotta come
to Mr. Cooper's office.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.630
- Why? What's wrong?
- Something you need to hear.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.886
Here... Here's your house keys.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.645
I figured I should...

09:24.814 --> 09:27.397
You know, since we're not...

09:30.904 --> 09:32.020
Thank you.

09:32.197 --> 09:35.406
- I'll bring your things tomorrow.
- You don't have to. I can...

09:35.575 --> 09:39.444
- I can pick them up whenever...
- It's no trouble. I'll bring them.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.167
Here he is.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.250
Agent Mojtabai says he recorded
a conversation Garvey had...

09:50.423 --> 09:53.291
- ...with a source of yours.
- Happened two minutes ago.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.336
We tracked Garvey to a bar
where he goes to see a woman.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.347
- A girlfriend, mistress?
- Just someone he knows.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.054
<i>I asked Aram for a bug,
which I placed on herjacket.</i>

10:02.227 --> 10:05.686
<i>- So, what have you got?
- Okay, I cued it up to the end.</i>

10:05.855 --> 10:08.848
Listen to the whole thing later,
but this part...

10:09.025 --> 10:12.393
...we gotta do something about it,
like, now. Here we go.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.357
<i>Are you gonna kill Reddington?</i>

10:14.531 --> 10:18.366
<i>A meeting's been set. He thinks
I'm giving him something he wants.</i>

10:19.452 --> 10:20.818
I have other plans.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.486
Meaning what?

10:22.664 --> 10:25.782
Meaning I'm about to do the world
a big favor.

10:30.046 --> 10:33.039
It's a trap, your meeting.
If you show up, you'll be killed.

10:33.216 --> 10:36.209
- How convenient.
<i>- What's that supposed to mean?</i>

10:36.719 --> 10:38.506
Yes.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.549
You gathering intel that indicates
I shouldn't go to a meeting...

10:42.725 --> 10:45.468
- ...you don't want me to attend.
- That's not what this is.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.261
"Two of your oxen have died.

10:47.438 --> 10:51.648
One round of play without an oxen card,
and everyone in your party has died."

10:51.818 --> 10:54.185
- I have oxen.
<i>- Are you listening?</i>

10:54.362 --> 10:57.446
- Where'd you get your information?
- I can't tell you.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.231
Then I'm not listening.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.118
"You have died of dysentery."

11:03.288 --> 11:04.620
Damn it.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.951
Elizabeth wouldn't lie about this.

11:07.125 --> 11:10.368
If she says it's dangerous for you to go,
I believe her.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.502
So do I.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.004
But I'm still going.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.926
- Yes?
- Mr. Sinclair.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.561
Raymond Reddington.

11:29.731 --> 11:33.224
<i>I told you a day would come
when I'd need you to perform...</i>

11:33.401 --> 11:36.269
...your peculiar brand of magic.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.483
That day has arrived.

11:41.701 --> 11:46.696
You want me to create a double for you
so that you can attend a meeting...

11:46.873 --> 11:49.991
...in which you anticipate
being assassinated.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.205
- Yes.
- Perhaps a better idea...

11:52.378 --> 11:54.335
...might be to skip the meeting.

11:54.505 --> 11:58.875
Perhaps. However, I'm afraid
the meeting is unavoidable.

11:59.052 --> 12:03.262
But I'm not in the business
of helping people skirt murder.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.798
I'm in the business of providing alibis.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.718
A trick that allows a man
to be in two places at once.

12:08.895 --> 12:13.060
An illusion I believe will come in handy
given the circumstances.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.226
Yes, but it's an illusion...

12:16.402 --> 12:20.146
...achieved by the most painstaking
of processes.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.819
It can take months to find a double.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.484
I then refine the likeness.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.528
Establish routines.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.412
Pattern behaviors.

12:29.582 --> 12:35.294
The whole meticulously crafted drama
that can take over a year to perfect.

12:35.463 --> 12:39.002
- You don't have a year.
- Mr. Reddington...

12:39.175 --> 12:43.135
...I want to help you, but there isn't time
to establish a routine.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.421
Without a routine,
there are no witnesses.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.715
Without witnesses, there is no alibi.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.305
I don't need an alibi, I need a double.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.969
And I need a year.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.603
You have 16 hours.

12:54.732 --> 12:59.397
Absolutely not. We're not putting you
in a dangerous situation like that.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.859
I must say, Harold,
I'm flattered by your concern.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.866
But I've spent a good part of my life
in such situations.

13:06.035 --> 13:09.028
- You have to call this off.
- What do you think will happen?

13:09.205 --> 13:12.789
Garvey's gonna confess
to murdering Singleton? And Tom?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.041
I'm sorry, Donald, I missed that.

13:15.211 --> 13:19.546
I was still basking in the glow
of Harold's concern for my well-being.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.082
Don't flatter yourself.

13:21.259 --> 13:24.593
And don't believe for one minute
we can protect you from Garvey.

13:24.762 --> 13:28.506
Oh, why, you're the FBI.
My God, what would J. Edgar think?

13:28.683 --> 13:31.847
Even if you could get Garvey to talk,
we'd need to explain...

13:32.020 --> 13:33.682
...how we recorded the meeting.

13:33.855 --> 13:38.646
How about you say you were looking
for the most wanted man in America...

13:38.818 --> 13:41.435
...and in a valiant but fruitless attempt...

13:41.612 --> 13:44.104
...to capture me,
you stumbled upon him.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.568
What's this really about?

13:45.742 --> 13:50.077
This is about justice for the man
who murdered Agent Keen's husband.

13:50.246 --> 13:54.411
<i>A dangerous and dirty cop,
who not only runs the ground troops...</i>

13:54.584 --> 13:58.077
<i>...for a drug syndicate,
but who also has exploited...</i>

13:58.254 --> 14:03.170
<i>...his considerable resources
within the U.S. Marshals Service.</i>

14:03.801 --> 14:05.918
Why make a play now?

14:06.304 --> 14:09.422
You kill Reddington,
you'll never get the intel you want.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.465
Reddington forced the issue.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.759
We take care of the bastard now.

14:13.936 --> 14:18.226
Ian Garvey has been untouchable.
I'm giving you a chance to do...

14:18.399 --> 14:21.187
...what the bureau has been unable to do
for over a year.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.822
Along with Garvey, if you're lucky,
you might even capture Zarak Mosadek...

14:25.990 --> 14:28.903
...who somehow slipped
through your fingers last time.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.444
You let Mosadek go,
now he's double-crossing you.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.203
That's what he thinks he's doing.

14:33.373 --> 14:37.538
In actuality, he's delivering Ian Garvey
to you on a silver platter.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.168
You just have to catch him
in the act of killing me.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.954
Not after he already has.

14:42.131 --> 14:46.216
If I sign off on this,
you're walking in there at your own risk.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.672
I feel confident.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.086
Why is that?

14:49.263 --> 14:52.552
God doesn't want me,
and the devil isn't finished.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.138
The meeting is scheduled
for 10 a.m. tomorrow.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.143
Do get a good night's sleep.

14:57.313 --> 15:02.058
I'll need you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
at the ass crack of dawn.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.862
I still think it's a dreadful idea.
A suicide mission.

15:11.369 --> 15:15.409
But I think I may have found
a way for you...

15:15.581 --> 15:18.665
...to attend the meeting
without being killed.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.872
Well, that's a start.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.412
We'll need vehicles and firearms.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.457
The usual makeup,
wardrobe and wig work.

15:26.634 --> 15:30.344
This reminds me of our high school
production of <i>Guys and Dolls.</i>

15:30.513 --> 15:33.677
A rousing rendition
of "Fugue for Tinhorns."

15:33.850 --> 15:36.968
Stubby Kaye has always been
something of a role model.

15:37.145 --> 15:40.434
- I don't know who that is.
- Stubby Kaye. <i>40 Pounds of Trouble?</i>

15:40.606 --> 15:43.314
Sam the Shade in <i>Cat Ballou?</i>

15:44.235 --> 15:46.727
Doesn't matter.
Let's hear about the plan.

15:46.904 --> 15:51.239
Well, first off, we're going
to need a very credible double.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.492
- Anthony.
- Mr. Reddington.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.995
This man is just the framework
upon which we will build.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.241
<i>It will be critical
that I have the right wardrobe.</i>

16:00.418 --> 16:05.004
<i>Color, cut, size.
Every detail is essential.</i>

16:05.173 --> 16:09.133
Shoe size, ties, suit size...

16:09.302 --> 16:12.716
<i>...all duplicates and exact matches.</i>

16:12.889 --> 16:16.348
<i>A little padding here, take in a little there.</i>

16:16.517 --> 16:20.056
And I'll need a very specific list
of theatrical supplies.

16:20.229 --> 16:24.769
<i>Molding clay, alginate,
latex, cheesecloth.</i>

16:24.942 --> 16:29.027
The supplies are not as important
as the craft.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.527
I can teach almost anyone anything...

16:32.700 --> 16:34.032
...given enough time.

16:34.202 --> 16:39.448
But for our purposes,
our double will have to learn quickly.

16:43.753 --> 16:46.871
In terms of our liabilities,
we have our work cut out.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.625
Dealing with Mr. Garvey and his men
will be difficult enough.

16:51.052 --> 16:55.592
But, additionally, we'll need
to contend with Mr. Mosadek...

16:55.765 --> 16:59.304
...and his fairly extensive security team.

16:59.477 --> 17:03.061
- And not to mention the FBI.
- All right, Aram, we're on site.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.814
What CCTV feeds do you have
in the area?

17:06.275 --> 17:07.435
<i>We're here.</i>

17:07.609 --> 17:11.148
Garvey and Mosadek's men
will likely take up positions...

17:11.321 --> 17:14.234
...here and here.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.820
The feds will hang back.

17:16.993 --> 17:20.031
They'll want altitude for clear sight lines.

17:20.205 --> 17:23.074
Here, here and possibly here.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.367
- Which means...
- You'll be surrounded.

17:26.587 --> 17:30.877
Even if our double is convincing
and nobody dies...

17:31.050 --> 17:34.919
...getting out of here is going
to be nearly impossible.

17:35.846 --> 17:39.760
Nearly. This extraction will require
two specific vehicles.

17:40.643 --> 17:45.058
A box truck and a sedan,
which you will arrive in.

17:45.231 --> 17:49.066
Chuck and Morgan can handle
the vehicles, whatever we need.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.428
What you need is to get
from this point...

18:22.602 --> 18:25.891
...to the northeast exit here.

18:26.314 --> 18:30.058
If you manage that
before you get shot or run over...

18:30.234 --> 18:33.022
...or arrested by the FBI...

18:33.195 --> 18:34.902
...this just might work.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.398
I will be a genius.

18:38.159 --> 18:42.073
Raleigh, are those new spectacles
or is that a twinkle in your eye?

18:42.246 --> 18:45.034
I am the first to admit
that a carefully planned job...

18:45.207 --> 18:48.291
...gives me great comfort.
But this sort of winging it?

18:48.461 --> 18:51.374
That has an exciting flair to it.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.789
That's the spirit. Let's have a little fun.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.502
But do your very best...

18:55.676 --> 18:59.044
...to make sure
Tony's not killed in the process.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.729
It's time.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.147
Check, check. Polar one, test.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.775
Check, check. Polar two, test.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.986
Polar one, we're getting interference.
Can you reposition...

19:21.160 --> 19:23.777
- ...10 degrees north?
- Ressler, what's your sitrep?

19:23.954 --> 19:26.321
Got two mercs,
30 yards to the southeast.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.161
- Concealed positions.
<i>- Agent Navabi.</i>

19:28.334 --> 19:31.168
I make one more pro,
20 meters southwest.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.546
I make two from the Nash Syndicate,
north of the quarry.

19:38.719 --> 19:42.429
Guys, Mr. Reddington is gonna be
completely surrounded.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.636
I will be in your ear the whole time.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.181
Now, remember, head high.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.347
Roll the walk.

19:58.072 --> 20:01.065
- All right, I got eyes.
- Principals are on the move.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.293
He's clean.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.963
To confirm our agreement...

21:06.140 --> 21:10.180
...you get your bag
and this war with Garvey ends.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.531
Stop.

21:35.002 --> 21:39.087
Were it not for the trouble the contents
of that bag have caused...

21:39.256 --> 21:41.498
<i>...you would have been dead long ago.</i>

21:41.675 --> 21:44.258
<i>You're still upset about that mess
with Tom Keen.</i>

21:44.428 --> 21:46.260
<i>Let's not forget Detective Singleton.</i>

21:46.680 --> 21:50.594
Takes a special kind of man
to kill his own colleague.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.054
<i>Keen was pleasure.</i>

21:52.561 --> 21:54.723
<i>Singleton was business.</i>

21:54.897 --> 21:57.640
- Keen, we've got him.
- Give us the green. We'll take him.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.399
<i>- Hold your position.
- Enough.</i>

21:59.568 --> 22:02.231
Mr. Garvey and I have
a lucrative business arrangement.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.943
- One that I would like to resume.
- The bag.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.197
Give it to him.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.823
Open it.

22:14.708 --> 22:18.042
Sorry, Mr. Reddington.
There's been a change of plans.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.499
- We've got a situation.
- Gun. Go. Move!

22:43.445 --> 22:45.311
Get out of there, son.

22:45.823 --> 22:47.940
- Go, go, go.
- I'm going, I'm going!

22:56.834 --> 22:59.121
Garvey's headed east to 395.

23:22.568 --> 23:25.732
Oh, my God! I murdered a drug lord!

23:25.905 --> 23:27.487
I'm having palpitations.

23:29.658 --> 23:32.150
Tony, quite a performance.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.989
<i>You did it.</i>

23:34.622 --> 23:36.488
My finest hour.

23:36.665 --> 23:40.284
I need some air.
Garvey's mug hurts my face.

23:54.558 --> 23:55.719
Where am I?

23:55.893 --> 23:58.010
Hello, Ian.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.977
Welcome back.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.230
I hope you had a good rest.

24:02.399 --> 24:05.267
There's much to discuss.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.607
<i>Following a shooting,
a manhunt is underway...</i>

24:12.785 --> 24:15.619
<i>- ...for U.S. Marshal Ian Garvey.</i>
- It feels good to be wanted.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.531
<i>a 30-year veteran
of the U. S. Marshals Service...</i>

24:18.707 --> 24:22.246
<i>...shot and killed an Afghan government
official named Zarak Mosadek.</i>

24:22.419 --> 24:24.411
What have you done?

24:24.838 --> 24:25.919
The impossible.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.503
I put you in two places
at the same time.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.087
I didn't shoot Mosadek.

24:30.260 --> 24:34.049
As a general rule,
a magician never explains his tricks.

24:34.223 --> 24:39.218
- I didn't shoot anyone.
- But this is too good to keep to myself.

24:39.395 --> 24:42.888
It started yesterday just after lunch.

24:43.065 --> 24:44.601
<i>Why make a play now?</i>

24:44.775 --> 24:47.768
<i>You kill Reddington,
you'll never get the intel you want.</i>

24:47.945 --> 24:49.527
<i>Reddington forced the issue.</i>

24:50.155 --> 24:52.067
We take care of the bastard now.

24:52.241 --> 24:56.235
<i>While you were plotting with your minions
from the Nash Syndicate...</i>

24:56.412 --> 25:00.497
<i>...I was hatching a plan with my men
to meet with you.</i>

25:04.211 --> 25:06.203
What the hell is this?

25:06.380 --> 25:12.718
With a butterfly kiss and a honeybee hug,
sleep tight little one, like a bug in a rug.

25:17.433 --> 25:21.052
<i>Then came a plaster mold
of your face, a willing double...</i>

25:21.562 --> 25:26.148
<i>...a little makeup,
a little make-believe, and voila!</i>

25:26.316 --> 25:28.023
Two Garveys with one stone.

25:28.193 --> 25:32.563
<i>While the real one slept, the imposter
picked up your men just in time...</i>

25:32.740 --> 25:37.860
...for them to see your off-Broadway debut
in all its theatrical glory.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.622
It's time.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.752
- Nobody's gonna believe this.
- They already do.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.797
The FBI believes you killed
an Afghan government official.

25:51.967 --> 25:55.631
Mosadek's colleagues believe
you killed the head of their cartel.

25:55.804 --> 25:59.388
The Nash Syndicate believes you killed
their biggest supplier.

26:00.768 --> 26:04.557
- If I give you the duffel bag?
- I'll perform another magic trick.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.518
My jet will take you and the missus
out of harm's way.

26:07.691 --> 26:11.981
I know a lovely little spot
on Namibia's Skeleton Coast.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.532
You can get me out?

26:18.452 --> 26:20.489
Where's the bag?

26:20.662 --> 26:24.076
Garvey was in business with Mosadek.
Why would he kill him?

26:24.249 --> 26:25.285
I don't know.

26:25.793 --> 26:29.787
- He cut a deal with Reddington?
- No. No way. Garvey...

26:29.963 --> 26:32.671
- ...hates Reddington.
- Then why not kill him?

26:32.841 --> 26:34.457
I told you, I don't know.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.259
Well, here's what we know.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.466
We know the meeting was a setup...

26:39.640 --> 26:42.553
...and Mosadek and Garvey conspired
to take Reddington out.

26:42.726 --> 26:46.720
You being there makes you part
of that conspiracy to murder.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.890
Now, you help us, we make it go away.

26:50.526 --> 26:54.190
- Why didn't Garvey kill Reddington?
- He was supposed to.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.729
Then why the double-cross?

26:55.906 --> 26:59.320
Garvey never said a bad word
about Mosadek. He admired him.

26:59.493 --> 27:02.156
He made a fortune off
protecting his cartel.

27:02.329 --> 27:06.323
Why Garvey killed Mosadek
instead of Reddington, I got no idea.

27:08.752 --> 27:12.837
He's got nothing. Whatever went down,
Garvey didn't tell him about it.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.965
- Did he tell Reddington?
- Think they were working together?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.717
Doesn't make sense otherwise.

27:17.886 --> 27:21.470
Garvey was in business with Mosadek.
Why kill him and not Reddington?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.348
- And there's no sign of them?
- Garvey's AWOL.

27:24.518 --> 27:26.635
Reddington isn't answering my calls.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.428
Guys.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.346
I got something.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.020
All right, so this...

27:33.193 --> 27:35.185
This is Garvey's sedan...

27:35.362 --> 27:38.105
...going under this freeway overpass.

27:38.282 --> 27:42.401
- And this is what came out.
- There's no sedan. Where did it go?

27:42.578 --> 27:44.319
- Is there an exit?
- Nope.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.782
It didn't disappear.

27:45.956 --> 27:48.994
It kind of did.
Into the back of that trailer.

27:49.168 --> 27:53.458
Courtesy of a Mr. Raleigh Sinclair.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.464
The Alibi, the man who can put you
in two places at once.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.716
We know why Reddington
kept him out of jail.

27:58.886 --> 28:02.004
He didn't double Reddington.
I saw him. He was at the meet.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.922
- Mosadek's dead.
- That leaves Garvey.

28:04.099 --> 28:07.638
Reddington knew Garvey was coming.
He got to him, doubled him...

28:07.811 --> 28:11.225
- ...had the double kill Mosadek.
- Garvey and Mosadek conspired...

28:11.398 --> 28:15.108
...to kill Reddington. Now one is dead
and the other is wanted for murder.

28:15.277 --> 28:18.441
Ressler, you're on The Alibi.
Put out a BOLO for Sinclair.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.823
Navabi, I want you on the impersonator.
He murdered Mosadek...

28:21.992 --> 28:24.655
...and got away in that truck.
Trace it, find it and him.

28:24.828 --> 28:28.071
We know where the real Garvey
and the duffel bag are. With Reddington.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.615
- He double-crossed us.
- Tell me about your contact.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.250
- How well does she know Garvey?
- Very well.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.537
If Red's forcing Garvey
to take him to that bag...

28:35.714 --> 28:38.047
...maybe your contact
can get us there first.

28:38.550 --> 28:42.385
- And why would I help you?
- If you do, Garvey will go to prison.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.216
If you don't, he'll be killed.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.221
- By Reddington.
- Yes. He has what Reddington wants.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.727
On TV, they're saying
he killed that man, Mosadek.

28:51.897 --> 28:55.436
- But you said they worked together.
- Did Garvey ever mention a duffel bag?

28:55.609 --> 28:58.568
Did he tell you where it might be?
A locker. A storage unit.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.649
- I don't know. Maybe.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

29:00.822 --> 29:04.611
- I'm at work.
<i>- Think about where the bag might be.</i>

29:04.785 --> 29:08.449
Helping me find it before Reddington
might save Garvey's life.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.671
What's that smell?

29:20.342 --> 29:22.208
Is that lavender?

29:24.096 --> 29:25.212
And mint.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.388
Is that your head?

29:28.558 --> 29:32.177
What kind of products do you use?
I'm dying of curiosity.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.845
Wouldn't that be nice.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.935
- You smell that?
- Yes. It's lovely.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.145
I'll say.

29:39.069 --> 29:41.686
Absolutely lovely.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.568
Whatever it is, we need to get some.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.802
Hey, mister. Can you hear me?
Easy, buddy.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.843
You're all right. You were in an accident.

30:18.608 --> 30:22.022
The other man. The one who was with us.
Where'd he go?

30:22.195 --> 30:24.312
I don't know. He took off.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.522
You all right?

30:27.367 --> 30:28.699
Come on.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.285
- Is that yours?
- Yeah.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.200
Please, I need your car.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.713
Thank you.

30:53.435 --> 30:56.052
- What have you done with Garvey?
<i>- There was an accident.</i>

30:56.229 --> 30:59.313
- You used The Alibi to double Garvey.
- Garvey got away.

30:59.483 --> 31:03.147
<i>- You expect me to believe that?</i>
- You knew the meeting was an ambush.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.858
You have a source.
Someone close to Garvey.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.317
I'm not answering that.

31:07.491 --> 31:11.531
If that source was assisting you,
Garvey knows and will try to get to him.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.696
I assume that's what you're doing.
Tell me where you're going.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.207
- So you can get to Garvey first?
<i>- I can protect you from him.</i>

31:18.377 --> 31:21.336
I don't need your protection.
What I need is that duffel bag.

31:21.505 --> 31:23.087
And I'm about to get it.

31:27.469 --> 31:28.505
We're closed.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.588
I said, we're clo...

31:32.933 --> 31:34.469
Ian.

31:36.937 --> 31:38.974
- Are you okay?
- Did you tell Keen?

31:39.147 --> 31:41.480
- What? No!
- Is that how Reddington knew?

31:41.650 --> 31:45.394
- You said you talked to her.
- Yeah, but I didn't say anything!

31:48.240 --> 31:51.108
On TV, they said
you killed that man, Mosadek.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.492
I'll pay you back when I can.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.029
What is happening, Ian?

31:56.665 --> 31:58.657
Meantime, say you were robbed.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.291
I am being robbed.

32:32.325 --> 32:35.409
<i>- Hello. Agent Mojtabai.</i>
- I need to find Agent Keen.

32:35.579 --> 32:36.820
<i>- It's urgent.</i>
- Reddington.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.284
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>
- Everything is not okay.

32:39.458 --> 32:43.828
She just hung up, angry and desperate.
I fear she's walking into a trap.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.120
<i>I need to find her.</i>

32:45.297 --> 32:47.755
<i>She probably doesn't
wanna talk to you...</i>

32:47.924 --> 32:52.339
- ...or have me help you find her.
- If your intent is to protect Elizabeth...

32:52.512 --> 32:55.004
...protect her from Garvey, not me.
She's in trouble.

32:55.182 --> 32:58.175
<i>- I thought you had Garvey.
- I did. He got away.</i>

32:58.351 --> 33:02.641
And now, like a hound, she's going
after an item Garvey took from me.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.181
I have no doubt
he's headed the same way.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.270
Okay. She went to meet someone.

33:07.444 --> 33:10.312
- Where?
<i>- I don't know, but this woman...</i>

33:10.489 --> 33:12.902
...Liz planted a listening device on her.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.987
If that device is within range
and transmitting...

33:16.161 --> 33:19.450
- ...I may be able to track it.
- Do it. Now.

33:23.835 --> 33:24.996
False alarm.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.873
- I didn't kill anyone.
- I didn't say anything to Keen.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.417
I believe you. I wish you'd believe me.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.795
I don't know what to believe anymore.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.009
I'm gonna need your car.

33:39.267 --> 33:42.010
Yeah. The keys are in the jacket.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.186
Ian, the whole world's looking for you.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.850
Where are you gonna go?

33:51.071 --> 33:52.607
Ian?

33:53.740 --> 33:55.322
What? What's wrong?

33:56.368 --> 33:57.404
What is that?

33:59.371 --> 34:01.283
That's how Reddington knew.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.743
It's a bug, put there by Keen.

34:03.917 --> 34:07.251
She heard us talk and squealed
to her lord and master.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.286
Why is the duffel bag so important?

34:09.464 --> 34:12.456
I need time to figure out
how to clear my name.

34:12.634 --> 34:15.047
When I do, I'll reach out.

34:15.219 --> 34:19.260
- There's so much you need to know.
- Can you please tell me now?

34:22.226 --> 34:25.264
Everything you believed
for the last 30 years has been a lie.

34:27.607 --> 34:30.440
You've spent a lifetime hiding
for no reason.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.023
Ian Garvey, FBI! Hands in the air!

34:33.989 --> 34:36.025
Do it now!

34:36.199 --> 34:38.612
You're under arrest.

34:39.034 --> 34:41.743
- You don't wanna do that.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.621
I can't think of anything
I've wanted more.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.286
I can.

34:47.710 --> 34:51.079
Hear what I have to say
about Reddington's little secret.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.996
You arrest me...

34:53.174 --> 34:55.460
...that's never gonna happen.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.140
Hands on the bar.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.815
- I'm listening.
- He didn't kill Mosadek.

35:11.985 --> 35:13.442
I know. I don't care.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.195
If I tell you what I know
about Reddington...

35:16.364 --> 35:18.902
...what guarantees do I have
that you won't arrest me?

35:19.075 --> 35:20.441
- None.
- He's innocent.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.827
If I can't get him
for murders he did commit...

35:22.996 --> 35:25.739
- ...I'm happy to get him for this.
- How can you say that?

35:25.915 --> 35:29.909
For the same reason she bugged you
and snitched on us. He owns her.

35:30.086 --> 35:34.251
She's an FBI agent in the pocket
of the FBI's most wanted criminal.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.548
He doesn't own her.

35:36.718 --> 35:41.463
- He is her. And she is him.
- Don't do this. I'm asking you not to.

35:42.724 --> 35:45.967
She's acting like a criminal
because she is the daughter of one.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.310
Reddington's her father.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.185
Yeah, and I'm her sister.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.405
Who I wish I could have gotten to know.

36:00.742 --> 36:04.326
I think we both know
it's too late for that.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.961
We've found no images on CCTV feeds
and no prints at the scene.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.964
We traced Sinclair's rig
to a warehouse in Takoma Park.

36:17.133 --> 36:21.127
We believe it was a staging area,
but it's been cleaned out.

36:21.304 --> 36:26.095
Okay, I hope I didn't make a huge mistake,
but I just hung up with Reddington.

36:26.267 --> 36:29.851
- What's wrong?
- He lost Garvey and can't reach Keen.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.647
He thinks she may be in danger,
so he asked me to help locate her.

36:33.817 --> 36:37.561
I pinged the transmitter on her
listening device before the signal cut out.

36:37.737 --> 36:40.696
- Back up. Reddington lost Garvey?
- So he says.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.824
- And the transmitter's off-line.
- Before the signal dropped...

36:43.993 --> 36:47.987
...it was broadcasting from East Fayette
Street in Baltimore. Pete's Tavern.

36:48.164 --> 36:51.077
- It's the same place Keen was meeting...
- With her source.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.538
- And where Reddington's headed.
- You tried Keen?

36:53.712 --> 36:55.829
- She's not answering.
- Keep trying. Get there.

36:56.005 --> 36:59.248
- Alert local P.D. and SWAT.
- On our way.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.336
Now I get it.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.551
Reddington and your husband,
how they knew each other.

37:07.267 --> 37:10.510
Reddington didn't know you through him.

37:11.438 --> 37:12.974
He knew him through you.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.275
- But the duffel bag...
- Where is it?

37:18.445 --> 37:20.903
How did your husband come by it?

37:21.072 --> 37:23.530
And why didn't he tell you
what was in it?

37:23.700 --> 37:28.161
Because you killed him before he could.
And if you try and tell it now...

37:28.663 --> 37:30.120
...I'll do the same to you.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.247
Utter one word.

37:32.417 --> 37:33.874
One article.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.626
A. An.

37:36.796 --> 37:37.877
The.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.413
And I'll shoot you.

37:40.925 --> 37:44.635
No, he won't.
Because if he does, I'll shoot him.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.757
You're right.
I'm unwilling to accept that...

37:49.934 --> 37:52.176
...I'm not entitled to know
why my husband died.

37:53.772 --> 37:57.265
I am hurt. I do blame you,
and pulling this trigger...

37:57.442 --> 38:01.482
...something I desperately do not want
to do, is me howling at the moon.

38:01.654 --> 38:04.271
Which is definitely your problem,
not mine.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.361
Tell the story.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.234
- Tell it!
- Stop.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.778
Wait. My hands are up.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.287
- No gun.
- What are you doing?

38:12.457 --> 38:15.200
- I'm not a threat to anybody.
- Except to yourself.

38:15.376 --> 38:18.619
I don't know what he's done to you
or what's in the duffel bag.

38:18.797 --> 38:22.962
And I don't care. All I know is that
my entire life he's protected me from you.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.421
It's about time I started protecting him.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.592
Look at me.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.679
Anything?

38:34.687 --> 38:35.848
I'm your daughter.

38:37.482 --> 38:41.442
The one you abandoned 28 years ago
on Christmas Eve.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.604
Jennifer.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.444
Did you think of me at all?

38:48.618 --> 38:52.703
In my pink room,
in my pink pajamas, waiting for Santa.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.081
When I went to sleep,
my world was perfect.

38:56.251 --> 38:59.039
And when I woke up, it was destroyed.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.503
My daddy gone.

39:01.923 --> 39:03.915
Did he just leave?

39:04.259 --> 39:06.967
Was it an accident? We didn't know.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.420
All we knew was my daddy...

39:09.597 --> 39:14.388
...my good, kind
and decent daddy was gone.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.141
And then come to find out,
you weren't good...

39:18.314 --> 39:20.226
...or kind or decent.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.517
You were a traitor.

39:23.736 --> 39:26.274
And we were sent into hiding.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.814
From you.

39:28.992 --> 39:30.984
From my father.

39:31.744 --> 39:36.034
And I'm telling you this because
if you are at all happy to see me...

39:36.207 --> 39:38.290
Which I'm sure you're not.

39:38.459 --> 39:42.499
But if there's one shred of relief
that I made it through this ordeal...

39:42.672 --> 39:44.334
...it's because of Ian.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.123
He saved me.

39:47.594 --> 39:50.052
That's why I'm standing here.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.838
Asking you, my father...

39:53.641 --> 39:55.928
...to please save him.

39:57.979 --> 40:00.062
That's entirely up to him.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.728
Dembe.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.365
- Ian.
- Call 911.

40:17.123 --> 40:21.493
Tell them there's been an officer-involved
shooting. It's a 10-33. Say it!

40:21.669 --> 40:24.207
- A 10-33.
- You will not die.

40:24.380 --> 40:28.499
You hear me, you piece of crap?
Not until you tell me what you know.

40:28.676 --> 40:31.134
You will not die.

41:31.781 --> 41:33.613
- Pulse 132 and thready.
- Get Cardiac down!

41:33.783 --> 41:35.820
- Cardiac Attending to Trauma 1.
- Six units of O-neg.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.156
- Eighty over 60.
- Let's get him to the OR.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.070
Now. Right now.

41:40.832 --> 41:45.668
Garvey. It's your last chance, Garvey.
Tell me about that duffel bag.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.204
I'll take care of Reddington, I promise.

41:54.345 --> 41:57.053
We're losing him. I don't have a pulse.
