WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:02.960
Mum! Mum!
Hey!

00:02.960 --> 00:04.960
I just wanna see them on my own.

00:04.960 --> 00:09.960
What if I could prove
that he arranged this whole thing?

00:09.960 --> 00:11.960
I know Theo.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.160
BECKY: While I'm sitting there
breaking his heart,

00:14.160 --> 00:16.320
his business is going up in flames.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.960
It's nice to finally meet you, Theo.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.960
This was Halloween?
Yeah.

00:21.960 --> 00:25.960
On Halloween, Â£90 worth of petrol
at the 24 service station.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.960
It's right there
on your bank statement.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.960
The CCTV would have shown you
filling up a load of canisters,

00:30.960 --> 00:31.960
but he's been following me.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.960
You was the one asking
about the cameras.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.960
GWEN: "Conspired with someone?"
What do you mean?

00:36.960 --> 00:38.960
You're here cos I saw Ed.
Or should I say Theo.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.960
THEO: 'This would all be simpler
if you could just stop pushing.'

00:41.960 --> 00:43.960
How do you know
what I have been doing?

00:43.960 --> 00:45.960
The day after Theo's car garage
burned down,

00:45.960 --> 00:48.960
I remember your washing
your clothes. They stank of petrol.

00:48.960 --> 00:49.960
You did it, didn't you?

00:49.960 --> 00:50.960
SHE YELPS
MAX: Mummy!

00:50.960 --> 00:53.960
It's OK. You're gonna be with Mummy
again soon, I promise you.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.960
She came to the house.
She can't prove anything.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.640
I hope so.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.800
WOMAN OVER PA: The train from
Platform 4 has been cancelled

01:26.800 --> 01:30.000
due to engineering works.
We apologise for any inconvenience.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.000
MAN OVER PA: Ladies and Gentlemen,
may I remind you

01:36.000 --> 01:38.960
that smoking is not permitted
anywhere on the station.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.960
WOMAN OVER PA: Welcome aboard.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.960
This is the service
to Glasgow Central,

01:47.960 --> 01:50.960
calling at Milton Keynes Central,

01:50.960 --> 01:52.960
Crewe, Warrington...

01:52.960 --> 01:54.640
THEO: Excuse me,
is anyone sitting there?

01:54.640 --> 01:55.960
OLIVIER: No. Please.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.960
'Ladies and gentleman...'

02:09.960 --> 02:10.960
Excuse me.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.160
Y'all right.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.960
'If you have any questions,
or would like to know

02:14.960 --> 02:16.960
'about our frequent
traveller's programme,

02:16.960 --> 02:18.960
'I'll be walking through the train.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.960
'My colleagues will be
coming through the train

02:20.960 --> 02:23.320
'with a trolley of drinks
and light refreshments.'

02:26.640 --> 02:27.960
Great minds, huh?

02:31.960 --> 02:35.960
Well, great minds might have given
up on it a few weeks ago, but...

02:35.960 --> 02:37.960
Yeah, maybe.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.960
CHIMES, MAN OVER PA:
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:39.960 --> 02:40.960
sorry, there are problems

02:40.960 --> 02:42.960
on the tracks today...
Oh, for f...

02:42.960 --> 02:43.960
'..and we'll be speed limited,

02:43.960 --> 02:46.320
'so our journey time
will be significantly longer...'

02:48.000 --> 02:49.960
Scotch, plain water, double.

02:49.960 --> 02:51.480
WOMAN: Of course.

02:51.480 --> 02:52.960
And for you, sir?

02:53.960 --> 02:55.960
Yeah, sounds good.
I'll have the same.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.960
Like I said. Great minds.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.960
Hm...

03:05.960 --> 03:08.960
You don't wanna go to this meeting,

03:08.960 --> 03:11.960
I definitely don't wanna go
to some bullshit christening,

03:11.960 --> 03:13.960
but here we are.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.960
And yet, we continue,
day in, day out.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.960
Cos what else is there?
Disruption!

03:18.960 --> 03:21.320
BOTH CACKLE

03:21.320 --> 03:23.160
I think we're causing enough
of that.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.960
What if there was something
you could do about your situation?

03:25.960 --> 03:27.160
There's nothing I can do.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.960
I've thought of every possible thing
I could do.

03:30.960 --> 03:35.960
All I can do is sit and wait for
the day she finally leaves for good.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.480
It was a warning this time,
it will happen again

03:38.480 --> 03:41.960
and she'll take my children
with her, out the door. Mine!

03:41.960 --> 03:43.960
And she wants to take my money
in the divorce.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.960
After all I gave her.
Men get a rough deal.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.960
Mm-hm.

03:48.960 --> 03:49.960
But...

03:51.960 --> 03:54.960
..what if there WAS something
you could do?

03:55.960 --> 03:57.960
Come on, you've thought about it,
haven't you?

03:57.960 --> 03:59.960
OLIVIER CHUCKLES GENTLY

03:59.960 --> 04:00.960
You have.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.960
Have you ever read a writer
named Ed Harrison?

04:06.960 --> 04:08.960
Can't say I have, no.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.960
I was reminded of it a few years ago

04:11.960 --> 04:13.960
when a girl in our office
went missing.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.960
She just disappeared.

04:17.960 --> 04:20.960
Anyway, that...
that's how the book starts.

04:21.960 --> 04:23.960
This girl goes missing and then...

04:25.960 --> 04:26.960
I was the...

04:26.960 --> 04:28.960
You know, sometimes I think of...

04:30.960 --> 04:32.640
OLIVIER CHUCKLES

04:32.640 --> 04:34.000
Oh, you can't tease me like that,
come on...

04:34.000 --> 04:36.960
No. Come on, it's...
It's just fantasy. That's all.

04:36.960 --> 04:37.960
Hey...
It's nothing.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.960
Hey, nothing wrong
with a bit of fantasy.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.960
No, look...
Come on, we all have 'em, though.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.960
Look, I have this car dealership,
right,

04:46.960 --> 04:49.960
and it's haemorrhaging money.
I kept it off the books

04:49.960 --> 04:53.960
for a while,
but I am fucked, Olivier.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.960
Well and truly.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.960
You want to know what my fantasy is?

05:00.640 --> 05:01.960
For that place to burn
to the ground

05:01.960 --> 05:03.960
and I get all the insurance money.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.960
The only problem with that...

05:07.960 --> 05:10.640
is the police
will look at me first.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.960
What I need is an alibi.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.480
OLIVIER CHUCKLES GENTLY

05:17.960 --> 05:19.960
I don't believe in fate, Olivier.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.320
I believe in luck.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.960
When you think about it,
the two of us meeting here today...

05:28.960 --> 05:30.960
Strangers.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.960
Nothing to connect us.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.960
I'm listening.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.960
All I'm saying is...

05:40.960 --> 05:45.160
Well... if I was to help you out
with your situation...

05:46.960 --> 05:48.960
..and if you were to help me out
with mine...

05:49.960 --> 05:51.960
No-one would ever know.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.960
She's the hero of the story.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.320
And what does she want, Max?

07:20.960 --> 07:22.800
One second, guys.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.480
Hi.
Hey.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.960
Sorry to bother you.
Is everything OK?

07:26.960 --> 07:29.960
I need to take the boys to hospital,
their dad's been taken in.

07:29.960 --> 07:33.480
God, I'm so sorry.
It's just weird timing.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.960
I'm sure you've heard
we're getting divorced, but erm...

07:35.960 --> 07:38.960
some things are more important,
aren't they?

07:38.960 --> 07:40.960
Of course.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.960
Max?

07:42.960 --> 07:44.960
SAM: Mummy, you're going too fast.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.960
MAX: What's going on?
We are going on an adventure.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.960
What, now?
What about school?

07:49.960 --> 07:52.960
School's off for today,
and the rest of the week.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.640
Maybe even longer.
Really?

07:54.640 --> 07:55.960
Yes!

07:55.960 --> 07:58.000
No way!

07:58.000 --> 08:00.960
So, where are we going?
Somewhere else.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.000
Thank you, bye!
Bye!

08:07.960 --> 08:09.960
I'm gonna beat you! Ah!

08:09.960 --> 08:12.960
Yes!
I beat you. I beat you!

08:14.960 --> 08:16.960
Right, this is what we need.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.960
There you go.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.960
When will we be there?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.960
Erm... not long. I don't think.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.960
Is it nice, the place we're staying?
I don't know.

08:30.960 --> 08:34.960
We are just gonna keep driving
until we find somewhere.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.800
Can I use your phone for the rest
of the journey? I'm afraid not.

08:37.800 --> 08:41.640
When we get there?
No, sweetheart. Sorry.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.960
But the group chat
with Blake and Sasha...

08:44.960 --> 08:47.000
I have to keep my phone off.
Mum, please?!

08:47.000 --> 08:49.960
It's for emergencies only,
otherwise it stays off.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.960
Are you serious?

08:51.960 --> 08:54.960
That is one rule
you guys cannot break. OK?

08:54.960 --> 08:57.960
But why?
No phones.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.960
Mum, please...
Just people. Talking. Oh...

09:01.960 --> 09:03.960
..and...

09:05.960 --> 09:08.960
..biscuits.
Oh, this is so cool!

09:08.960 --> 09:10.960
Is Dad going to meet us there?

09:10.960 --> 09:12.160
We have got biscuits.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.960
No.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.960
Dad won't be joining us.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.960
Why?

09:20.960 --> 09:23.960
Well, because... your dad and I...

09:27.960 --> 09:30.160
Well, because...

09:30.160 --> 09:31.960
Why not, Mum?

09:31.960 --> 09:33.960
He's busy.
Oh.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.960
Poor Daddy.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.960
Yeah.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.960
Poor Daddy.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.960
She just walked out of the school.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.960
My two children, she walks in,
she takes them,

09:47.960 --> 09:49.960
and not a single person
tries to stop her.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.960
How the fuck does that happen?

09:51.960 --> 09:53.640
MAN ON PHONE, FAINTLY:
'Er, Mr Meyer...'

09:53.640 --> 09:56.000
I'm... I'm sorry, Detective,
I apologise.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.960
My wife has not been well.
'Yes..'

09:58.960 --> 10:01.960
She was sectioned, not long ago,
and...

10:01.960 --> 10:03.960
and now she's...
she's stolen from me.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.960
She's abducted my children.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.320
I know my rights,

10:08.320 --> 10:11.960
and this is abduction,
and she's in no condition to...

10:11.960 --> 10:13.960
'Can you come into the station?'

10:13.960 --> 10:16.960
Yes, of course. I can come
into the station if that's...

10:16.960 --> 10:19.000
That's fine.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.960
Mm-hm.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.960
'..anywhere she might have gone,
a friend's?'

10:22.960 --> 10:25.480
No, I-I... I don't. No, I have...

10:25.480 --> 10:27.960
no idea where she could be.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.480
Uh-huh.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.960
'..mobile records, so we'll tell you
when to come to the station.'

10:32.960 --> 10:34.960
Thank you, Detective. Thank you.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.640
WELSH ACCENT: Can I help you?

11:56.640 --> 11:59.320
Oh, hi, yeah. I wondered
if you have anything available?

11:59.320 --> 12:00.960
There's three of us.
Me and two kids.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.960
Oh, little ones overexcited, is it?

12:02.960 --> 12:05.640
Something like that, yeah.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.960
Yeah, bless.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.960
School out early for them, eh?

12:09.960 --> 12:11.960
Right.

12:11.960 --> 12:12.960
Is it OK if I pay in cash?

12:14.480 --> 12:15.960
Course, yeah.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.960
OK.
No, no, no.

12:17.960 --> 12:20.960
Don't have to do that now, love.
Come on. Let's get you sorted.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.960
Thanks

12:25.160 --> 12:28.000
Mind your feet there.
Thanks.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.960
Just this one here.
Great.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.000
The penthouse.
Guys, come on.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.480
Watch the steps.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.960
There you go,
that's the living room.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.960
And er... there's your keys.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.960
Great.
There you go. If you need anything.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.160
Welcome to paradise.
Thanks.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.960
So, we're looking through
CCTV footage of the motorways,

13:02.960 --> 13:06.960
and we're obviously monitoring
her credit cards and her phone...

13:06.960 --> 13:08.160
Her phone's off.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.640
She's not stupid.
No. But she hasn't left the country.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.960
And with two young children in tow,
it's just a matter of time...

13:14.960 --> 13:17.160
"A matter of time?"

13:17.160 --> 13:19.960
How many of you
are even working on this?

13:20.960 --> 13:23.960
I-I told you, she's dangerous...

13:23.960 --> 13:25.960
She's not been well.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.960
We're doing what we can, Mr Meyer.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.160
She took my children.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.960
My children are in danger.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.960
I understand.
Right.

13:40.960 --> 13:41.960
So, I'll be off,

13:41.960 --> 13:44.960
and I'll let you know
if there are any developments.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.960
Please do.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.960
GRUNTING

14:50.960 --> 14:52.960
GRUNTING

15:09.960 --> 15:11.960
CHILDREN CHATTER EXCITEDLY

15:13.800 --> 15:15.960
Yes!
Yeah! Finally!

15:17.960 --> 15:19.960
Bye-bye!
Bye!

15:28.960 --> 15:30.960
Hey.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.160
Did you say a nice goodbye
to your friends?

15:33.160 --> 15:34.960
Will they come back?

15:34.960 --> 15:36.960
No, love, they were just here
for the weekend on holiday.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.000
They had to go back home.
When are WE going back home?

15:41.960 --> 15:43.960
Er...

15:47.960 --> 15:49.960
Well, erm...

15:51.960 --> 15:55.960
Remember when I wasn't very well,

15:55.960 --> 15:59.000
and we didn't see each other
for a long time?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.960
I didn't like that.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.960
No, sweetheart, nor did I.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.960
And the truth is...

16:10.960 --> 16:12.960
..that...

16:12.960 --> 16:16.000
it's your dad that's not very well.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.320
And he needs some help
with his anger.

16:20.320 --> 16:24.800
You've seen him when...
he shouts at me...

16:24.800 --> 16:26.960
at you.
You know how he can be sometimes.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.640
Well, we can't be around him
any more.

16:33.640 --> 16:34.960
For how long?

16:35.960 --> 16:38.000
I'm not sure.
But what about my friends,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.960
and my room, and my toys?
I know. I know, sweetheart.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.160
I miss home too. I do.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.960
But it's just not safe.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.320
Look...

16:49.320 --> 16:51.960
This is what we're gonna do.

16:51.960 --> 16:55.640
We are going to rest here,
just for a bit,

16:55.640 --> 16:58.960
catch our breath,
I'm gonna figure some things out.

16:58.960 --> 17:03.960
And things might not feel normal
for a while.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.960
But that just means

17:06.960 --> 17:09.960
that we have to really look
after each other, us three.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.960
And... we'll get through it.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.480
I promise.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.000
Quick, quick, before Mum sees.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.640
CHUCKLING

17:54.960 --> 17:55.960
WHISPERS: Hurry!

17:55.960 --> 17:58.960
Make sure to put it back.
Mm-hm.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.160
I'm gonna beat you!
You won't.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.160
Guys, don't go too far.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.640
Mum, Mum, the wellies.

18:21.640 --> 18:22.960
Ah!
Yes!

18:24.960 --> 18:27.960
Hey...
You shall not pass!

18:27.960 --> 18:30.800
OK, go, go.
Hi!

18:30.800 --> 18:33.960
You guys all right?
Er, yeah.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.960
Erm... I forgot to pack
their wellies.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.960
I just wondered if you had
any kids' ones? Yes.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.960
We're never short of those. Here.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.960
Let me show you...

18:42.960 --> 18:47.960
I reckon... these would be good.

18:47.960 --> 18:48.960
Great.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.960
DOOR OPENS, SHOP BELL RINGS,
SHE GASPS

18:50.960 --> 18:53.960
Wish they could turn the volume
on that thing down somehow.

18:53.960 --> 18:57.320
It's fine. Just...
one too many coffees this morning.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.640
MAN ON TV: For 15 points, Sally,

18:59.640 --> 19:02.960
can you tell me what item
of clothing was named

19:02.960 --> 19:05.960
after its Scottish inventor?

19:05.960 --> 19:07.960
For 15 points...

19:07.960 --> 19:10.320
Kilt!
..what item of clothing was named

19:10.320 --> 19:12.960
after its Scottish inventor?

19:12.960 --> 19:14.640
Erm...

19:14.640 --> 19:16.800
tartan?

19:16.800 --> 19:18.960
Tartan? Tartan's...
Tartan's not even...

19:18.960 --> 19:21.480
A mackintosh.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.960
It is, of course...

19:23.960 --> 19:26.960
a mackintosh!
AUDIENCE GROANS

19:28.960 --> 19:31.960
Can I help you?
I hope so.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.960
I'm looking for someone.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.960
A woman.
Two boys with her, six and nine.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.960
Must have arrived
in the last day or two?

19:41.960 --> 19:43.000
No, I, er...

19:45.160 --> 19:47.960
No. Er, no.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.960
I can't think of anyone
of that description that's been by.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.960
She said she was coming here.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.960
Must have gone somewhere else.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.960
Sorry.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.960
Don't be sorry.

20:03.640 --> 20:06.000
You're only trying to help.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.960
HE CHUCKLES GENTLY

20:09.960 --> 20:12.960
MAN ON TV: For 20 points now,

20:12.960 --> 20:15.480
where would you find
the Sea of Tranquillity?

20:17.960 --> 20:20.960
'For 20 points.'
WOMAN: Think I know this one.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.960
It's the moon, I think.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.960
The answer...

20:28.960 --> 20:31.320
The answer is...

20:31.320 --> 20:33.960
is the moon! Sally!

20:33.960 --> 20:36.320
What would you do if you got
to the top of the mountain, Sally?

20:36.320 --> 20:38.960
I'd go on a holiday.
A holiday, yeah!

20:38.960 --> 20:40.960
Anywhere in the world, Sally?
Cornwall.

20:40.960 --> 20:41.960
Cornwall?

20:41.960 --> 20:45.800
SOUND DISTORTS, CRACKLES

20:51.960 --> 20:53.960
Hiya.
Hiya, love, all right?

20:53.960 --> 20:55.960
Yeah, all good, yeah.
How did you get on?

20:55.960 --> 20:59.960
Good, yeah. Found some
in the charity shop in the end.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.960
Did you go to the ones
up the top of the high street?

21:01.960 --> 21:03.960
Yeah.
Proper bargain shops up that end.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.960
FAINT CHATTER

21:06.960 --> 21:09.960
CHUCKLING
..it's perfect.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.160
Whoa!

21:11.160 --> 21:12.960
Whoa!
Whoa!

21:35.960 --> 21:37.960
Give it back!

21:37.960 --> 21:39.960
Guys, just calm down, OK?

21:39.960 --> 21:41.960
Give them back. Mum!

21:41.960 --> 21:43.960
Ow! Ow!

21:43.960 --> 21:45.320
Mum!

21:45.320 --> 21:47.000
Boys, stop it!
Ow!

21:47.000 --> 21:48.640
SAM SQUEALS
Stop it! Ow!

21:48.640 --> 21:50.960
Boys, stop...
SHE GASPS

21:50.960 --> 21:52.960
Christ!
Are you OK?

21:52.960 --> 21:55.960
Yeah. Yeah, it's just, er...
It's just a little burn, that's all.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.640
Erm...
SAM SQUEALS

21:57.640 --> 21:59.320
Ow!
The water's gone.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.960
I'm just gonna, erm... erm...
No!

22:00.960 --> 22:03.960
OK, right. Just stay...
Guys... Guys, stop!

22:03.960 --> 22:06.960
OK, sit down, stay there.
I'll just be back in two minutes.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.000
OK?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.960
Ow! No! Mum!

22:14.960 --> 22:16.960
Mary, could you just keep an eye
on the kids?

22:16.960 --> 22:18.960
I just burned my hand.
Yeah. Yeah, course.

22:18.960 --> 22:19.960
Thanks.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.960
Angela?

23:15.960 --> 23:17.960
Thank God, you're here.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.960
Please, just come quickly.
Shit.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.960
Shit.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.960
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't really know what to do.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.960
Sam! Max!

23:32.960 --> 23:34.960
Max!

23:37.160 --> 23:38.960
Sam!

23:41.960 --> 23:43.960
CHILDREN GIGGLING

23:58.960 --> 24:02.480
PANTING

24:02.480 --> 24:04.960
Stop! Stop!

24:04.960 --> 24:06.960
Mum, what are you doing?

24:06.960 --> 24:08.960
What's going on?
Mum!

24:10.800 --> 24:12.640
I should fucking wring your neck!

24:12.640 --> 24:14.960
With your children watching?
Yeah, maybe I should.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.000
You've told them enough lies
about me, about my "anger".

24:17.000 --> 24:19.960
I told them the truth.
You told them YOUR truth.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.160
They didn't need a great deal
of persuasion

24:22.160 --> 24:23.960
to leave this fucking dump.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.960
I can't believe after everything,

24:25.960 --> 24:26.960
THIS is your choice?

24:26.960 --> 24:28.960
You didn't leave me with a choice!

24:28.960 --> 24:31.960
You never loved me.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.000
Not really.
Oh, but I did.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.960
That's the worst part.
I fucking did.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.640
Get out of the way. I'm leaving.

24:37.640 --> 24:39.960
You are fucking sick,
do you know that?

24:39.960 --> 24:42.960
Using Edgewater, making me believe
this fucking shit!

24:42.960 --> 24:45.960
But you did believe it,
didn't you?

24:45.960 --> 24:47.960
We convinced you.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.960
So was it all a lie?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.640
Yuki?
Yuki?

24:55.640 --> 24:56.960
The affair?

24:56.960 --> 24:58.960
Yuki Okubo went missing, Angela.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.320
That's what the police said,
isn't it?

25:03.320 --> 25:04.960
It wasn't easy,
I can tell you that.

25:04.960 --> 25:07.160
This can't be easy either,
standing there,

25:07.160 --> 25:08.960
not being able to lay a finger
on me.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.960
I bet you're desperate
to give me some stitches

25:10.960 --> 25:11.960
like the good old days.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.960
This needs to be the end of it,
Angela, and it will be.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.960
This little episode...

25:17.960 --> 25:20.960
..it won't help your custody
request.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.960
You'll be lucky enough
to serve time in prison.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.960
What's going on?
What's happening, Dad?

25:25.960 --> 25:28.960
Dad? We're going to have
to say goodbye to Mum.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.960
I'll be back soon, OK?
I'll be here, it's gonna be OK.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.000
Where are we going?
We won't see Mum for a while.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.960
Mum? Mum!
It's OK. It's OK.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.960
Mum? Mummy!
Mummy?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.960
Mum...
Mum!

25:40.960 --> 25:42.640
SOBBING: Mum...

25:42.640 --> 25:44.800
Mum, Mum...
Mum...

25:48.960 --> 25:52.960
SHE CRIES

26:09.960 --> 26:11.960
'I'm just so tired.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.960
'I'm tired of been angry
and scared.'

26:17.960 --> 26:19.960
SHE SCREAMS

26:19.960 --> 26:21.320
Get away from the house!

26:21.320 --> 26:22.960
'Mum, you're scaring us.'

26:22.960 --> 26:24.960
'It's like there's nothing left
of me any more.'

26:26.960 --> 26:28.960
This will pass.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.960
All of it.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.960
Yeah....

26:36.960 --> 26:39.000
It's just the last time
I felt like this...

26:40.640 --> 26:42.000
..was right before Edgewater.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.960
Like I'm not in control.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.960
'You think Edgewater
will make me believe this shit!'

26:49.960 --> 26:51.960
But you did believe it.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.960
'Didn't you?'
'Olivier?'

26:53.960 --> 26:56.160
'Monster.'
'We convinced you.'

26:56.160 --> 26:58.960
'What kind of person
does this to someone?

26:58.960 --> 27:01.320
'Someone that's suffered
like I have.'

27:01.320 --> 27:02.960
'What did I ever do
to deserve that?'

27:02.960 --> 27:04.640
SHE GRUNTS, YELPS

27:09.960 --> 27:11.960
'You push on something enough...

27:11.960 --> 27:13.160
'it breaks.'

27:15.960 --> 27:18.960
'If you keep pushing
on those pieces left behind...'

27:24.960 --> 27:27.640
'..then they'll break too.'

28:00.960 --> 28:03.960
Are you Craig Mantle?
Who's asking?

28:03.960 --> 28:06.960
My name's Angela Black.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.960
I wanted to talk to you
about Mantle Motors.

28:09.960 --> 28:10.960
Look, I'm sorry, I'm busy...

28:10.960 --> 28:12.960
You gave your business
to a man called Theo Walters.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.480
It wasn't a sale,
you just signed it over.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.960
Why did you do that?

28:16.960 --> 28:18.960
You can't just show up like this,
you know?

28:18.960 --> 28:20.960
On a man's doorstep, asking...
Please.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.000
Please. My husband, he....

28:23.960 --> 28:26.960
He knocked out my tooth. He's...

28:26.960 --> 28:29.960
dragged me, by my hair,
down a flight of stairs...

28:29.960 --> 28:32.800
He's kicked me, punched me.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.960
But now... he's taken my children.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.960
And that hurts more
than anything he's ever done to me.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.160
You've got kids, grandkids?

28:42.640 --> 28:44.960
Put things in perspective,
don't they?

28:44.960 --> 28:47.960
Get you thinking about what kind
of world they're gonna grow up in,

28:47.960 --> 28:49.960
what kind of example
we're setting for them?

28:49.960 --> 28:51.960
What do they see, when...

28:51.960 --> 28:54.480
when those kids look at you?
What do they see?

28:54.480 --> 28:57.160
Craig, what kind of a man are you?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.960
I do the best I can.

29:00.960 --> 29:04.960
Theo helped my husband
to take away my children.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.000
And I know nothing about him.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.960
I'm just trying to understand.
Please.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.960
If people come knocking,
asking questions, I'll deny 'em.

29:14.960 --> 29:17.960
Fine. That's fine.

29:17.960 --> 29:18.960
He lied for me.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.960
In court.

29:23.960 --> 29:27.160
I was in a lot of trouble with...

29:27.160 --> 29:29.960
with some particularly
hard bastards.

29:29.960 --> 29:32.960
Theo was just some guy.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.960
Someone who shared the same local.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.960
I needed a way out.

29:36.960 --> 29:37.960
He said he could help...

29:39.160 --> 29:41.160
..if I did something for him.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.960
So... I put him on the deed.

29:45.960 --> 29:47.000
Blokes like that,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.480
people who don't care
about anything or anyone.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.960
Vampires, leeching
on other people's misery...

29:54.960 --> 29:57.000
any way they can.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.960
Yeah,
I've known a few like that myself.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.960
Thank you.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.960
'Reminds me of something my nan
always used to say.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.960
