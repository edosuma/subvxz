00:46.440 --> 00:49.944
For some odd reason,
lost in the mists of time,

00:50.039 --> 00:53.612
there's an extraordinary
shortage of last names in Wales.

00:53.707 --> 00:57.985
Almost everyone seems to be
a Williams, a Jones or an Evans.

00:58.073 --> 01:00.383
To avoid widespread confusion,

01:00.473 --> 01:04.352
Welsh people often add
an occupation to a name.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.284
For example, there was
Williams the Petroleum...

01:07.373 --> 01:09.944
and Williams the Death.

01:10.039 --> 01:14.488
There was Jones the Bottle
and Jones the Prize Cabbage,

01:14.573 --> 01:17.281
which described his hobby
and his personality.

01:17.373 --> 01:21.879
Evans the Bacon...
and Evans the End of the World.

01:21.973 --> 01:23.884
The Lord God tells us.
It's all in His book.

01:23.973 --> 01:26.078
But one man's name
was a puzzle.

01:26.173 --> 01:30.588
And it wasn't until I was ten years old
that I asked my grandfather...

01:30.673 --> 01:35.213
about the man with the longest
and most enigmatic name of all.

01:35.306 --> 01:39.448
The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill
But Came Down A Mountain?

01:39.540 --> 01:42.851
Now there's a long name for you,
and a long story.

01:46.906 --> 01:49.147
You are not going
to fidget, are you?

01:49.240 --> 01:52.619
For this is a story--
an epic story.

01:52.707 --> 01:54.983
Yes, epic.

03:26.306 --> 03:29.219
It must have
been 1917, on a Sunday,

03:29.306 --> 03:33.755
when two retired army officers
arrived in Ffynnon Garw.

03:33.839 --> 03:38.083
The younger man, Anson,
was just startin' to enjoy life,

03:38.173 --> 03:41.017
having recently left hospital
after service in France.

03:41.106 --> 03:45.350
However, his superior,
George Garrad,

03:45.440 --> 03:47.647
had been retired
to the Ordnance Survey...

03:47.739 --> 03:50.686
in the hope that this would help
the morale of his troops,

03:50.772 --> 03:53.753
who'd been driven to drink
by his irksome personality.

04:03.772 --> 04:05.877
Many men had gone
to the Great War,

04:05.973 --> 04:08.749
and the rest of the village
was in chapel.

04:08.839 --> 04:11.547
All except Morgan the Goat,
of course.

04:16.639 --> 04:21.019
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Well, does anyone here speak English?

04:21.106 --> 04:24.280
Oh, English, are you?

04:24.373 --> 04:26.944
Huh? Huh. That would
explain everything.

04:27.039 --> 04:31.454
- Well, it's Sunday. They're all in chapel.
- We're just wondering if, um--

04:31.540 --> 04:34.419
Charming.
We'll press on, I think.

04:38.906 --> 04:42.115
Well, do you want to come in or don't you?

04:44.806 --> 04:47.912
As I said, the rest
of the village was in chapel,

04:48.006 --> 04:50.509
includin' mothers
with babies.

04:50.606 --> 04:55.316
Since the young men went to war, there
seemed to be a lot of ginger-haired babies.

04:55.406 --> 04:58.353
But in those hard times,
no one seemed to mind...

04:58.440 --> 05:00.716
except Reverend Jones,
of course.

05:00.806 --> 05:05.084
Are all of the wicked men
just in Germany?

05:05.173 --> 05:08.245
Wouldn't that be nice
if all the wicked men...

05:08.340 --> 05:10.911
were on the battlefields
of France?

05:11.006 --> 05:14.112
Oh, Reverend Jones
was in fine form that day.

05:14.206 --> 05:16.812
Nearly every Sunday
he preached against the war...

05:16.906 --> 05:19.614
and Morgan the Goat,
in that order,

05:19.706 --> 05:22.949
though he never mentioned
Morgan the Goat by name, of course.

05:23.039 --> 05:26.452
They are also among us here...

05:26.540 --> 05:30.044
in this very village.

05:30.139 --> 05:32.050
What's yours?

05:33.139 --> 05:35.676
Well, um,
that's very kind.

05:35.772 --> 05:38.685
I'll, uh, have
a pint of bitter, thank you.

05:43.006 --> 05:44.952
Morgan?

05:49.873 --> 05:53.218
Well, pleasant enough
sort of place, isn't it?

05:53.306 --> 05:56.185
I suppose so,
considering it's Wales.

05:58.139 --> 06:00.779
A valued guest.
A regular.

06:00.873 --> 06:04.013
Very particular.
Refined even.

06:10.706 --> 06:13.778
This is turning out to be quite a busy spot.

06:16.539 --> 06:20.715
Now then. Oh.

06:20.806 --> 06:22.752
Oh, I hate the summer.

06:22.839 --> 06:24.876
Ah, morning, Sergeant.

06:24.973 --> 06:28.045
Morning.
My name is Garrad. George Garrad.

06:28.139 --> 06:32.053
Uh, we're staying here
at the inn.

06:32.139 --> 06:35.382
I guessed that from your luggage.
English, are you?

06:35.473 --> 06:37.453
Looking for more coal,
I suppose.

06:37.539 --> 06:40.019
No.
Cartographer, actually.

06:40.106 --> 06:42.017
Yes, sort of surveyors,
if you like.

06:42.106 --> 06:44.177
We make maps. We're here
to measure the mountains.

06:44.273 --> 06:46.184
Very useful, I'm sure.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.879
I'll have you know it's
an important part of the war effort.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.884
One must know
one's terrain.

06:50.973 --> 06:53.283
You've come to the right
place with your measurings.

06:53.373 --> 06:57.412
There's some terrain. That's
a mountain. First mountain in Wales.

06:59.273 --> 07:01.719
- What's it called?
- Ffynnon Garw.

07:01.806 --> 07:04.582
Goodness gracious,
these Welsh names.

07:04.672 --> 07:07.380
Would you mind
saying that again?

07:07.472 --> 07:10.385
"Fuh-non Gar-rue," man.
It's simple. Listen.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.611
I'll write it down
for you now...

07:12.706 --> 07:14.686
so you can get it right
on your map doings.

07:14.772 --> 07:19.949
Thank you. Thank you very much. Of course, it
will only appear if it's over a thousand feet.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.747
Don't be twp, man.
That's well over a thousand.

07:24.472 --> 07:26.509
Now then.

07:31.073 --> 07:33.986
Oh, eh--
Excuse me.

07:34.073 --> 07:36.485
- I think--
- You ready for another?

07:36.572 --> 07:39.644
You can keep the change,
Mr. Morgan!

07:39.739 --> 07:43.050
Thank you, Miss Elizabeth.
Thank you very much.

07:43.139 --> 07:45.119
Ooh, that Morgan!

07:47.973 --> 07:51.352
Look, sorry.
Could I please have a pint of bitter?

07:51.439 --> 07:54.181
No need to get
all English about it.

08:08.206 --> 08:12.177
Hey, the English are in the pub, and they
say they come to measure the mountain.

08:12.273 --> 08:14.844
All this way
just to measure our mountain.

08:14.939 --> 08:17.510
Measuring it?

08:17.606 --> 08:21.110
Well, who needs to know
the height of a mountain, I ask.

08:31.373 --> 08:34.183
- Another drink, gentlemen?
- Ah-ha! No. No.

08:34.273 --> 08:37.186
- No, thank you. Most hospitable.
- Yes, no, no, thanks.

08:37.273 --> 08:39.582
- Anything else I can be getting you?
- No.

08:39.672 --> 08:43.414
All right then. I'll be taking the dog
for a walk. See you in the morning.

08:43.505 --> 08:46.042
Oh, there is one thing.

08:46.139 --> 08:50.212
I know it's hard to find staff in this time
of war, but we will require an assistant.

08:50.306 --> 08:52.411
Someone quite strong,
preferably.

08:52.505 --> 08:54.883
I think you will find that
His Majesty's Ordnance Survey...

08:54.973 --> 08:57.078
will provide
equitable remuneration.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.674
They'll pay,
but not very much.

09:00.772 --> 09:03.343
Oh.

09:03.439 --> 09:06.511
Well, those that aren't
in France are down the mines.

09:06.606 --> 09:09.280
- Of course, there's Johnny Shellshocked.
- Sorry. Who?

09:09.372 --> 09:12.285
Johnny Jones, back from the war.
Gone a little doodle-alley-tap.

09:12.372 --> 09:15.581
- He lives with his sister, poor thing. But strong.
- Oh, I see.

09:15.672 --> 09:18.016
As long as you don't
expect him to talk... or think.

09:18.106 --> 09:21.315
We will require
his services just as a porter.

09:21.405 --> 09:24.352
Oh, well.
Johnny should be able to manage that.

09:24.439 --> 09:28.353
- Perhaps we could meet him.
- Oh, absolutely. First thing in the morning.

09:30.939 --> 09:34.512
He seems to have rather
an impatient dog, wouldn't you say?

09:34.606 --> 09:37.348
Yeah.

09:59.539 --> 10:02.782
- Why not?
- Because he's not ready.

10:02.873 --> 10:05.183
All he has to do
is hold a pole straight.

10:05.273 --> 10:09.119
Don't be twp. No one gets paid
for just holdin' a pole.

10:09.206 --> 10:11.914
Unless you're Betty
from Cardiff.

10:12.006 --> 10:14.646
- Don't start that again.
- Megan said she saw her,

10:14.739 --> 10:17.549
all tarted up again
in the pub on Saturday.

10:17.639 --> 10:20.711
She's been advisin' me on
the refurbishment of my establishment.

10:20.806 --> 10:23.218
Refurbishin'
your establishment!

10:23.305 --> 10:25.876
I've never heard it
called that before.

10:40.706 --> 10:42.617
Mornin', Johnny.

10:44.372 --> 10:48.320
I got some English stayin' at the pub.
Makin' maps, daft buggers.

10:48.405 --> 10:51.352
They need help, of course.

10:51.439 --> 10:54.079
Someone to carry
what they can't or won't.

10:54.173 --> 10:56.653
There's money.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.117
So should I tell them
you're interested?

11:02.173 --> 11:06.019
Well, uh, come along
to the pub later, all right?

11:07.372 --> 11:10.717
Ah! Good mornin',
Reverend Jones.

11:10.806 --> 11:14.310
I see God's in His heaven
and all's well with the world.

11:14.405 --> 11:16.942
- Have you no shame?
- No!

11:19.873 --> 11:22.479
I can't think where I've left it.

11:40.873 --> 11:44.753
When does a hill
become a mountain?

11:45.139 --> 11:47.176
I think it must be a comparative term.
I mean,

11:47.239 --> 11:49.742
you take the Himalayas
of India.

11:49.839 --> 11:54.015
There they have mountains of 10,000 feet which
are referred to, I believe, as foothills.

11:54.106 --> 11:56.882
But take our mountain.
That isn't a foothill!

11:56.973 --> 12:00.682
Well, again, placed in the Alps, it
wouldn't even be considered a hillock.

12:00.772 --> 12:05.243
- But it isn't in the Alps! It's here! Here in Wales!
- Oh, quite.

12:05.339 --> 12:10.687
So who-- who decides
on British maps?

12:13.339 --> 12:17.151
Mr. Davies,
now this in confidence.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.677
- They're saying--
- What, the English?

12:20.772 --> 12:26.313
Yes! They're saying that
it must be over 1,000 feet.

12:26.405 --> 12:30.547
Really! I'd imagined
5,000 was the standard.

12:30.639 --> 12:32.812
But how high is Ffynnon Garw?

12:32.906 --> 12:35.648
Is it over a thousand?
Over two thousand?

12:35.739 --> 12:38.686
A thousand? I'd always imagined
it was a few hundred.

12:42.073 --> 12:46.283
Oh, dear. Oh, and I thought
you were an educated man.

12:46.372 --> 12:48.318
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

12:49.606 --> 12:51.916
The first mountain
in Wales.

12:52.006 --> 12:56.477
Yes, it is something we have
boasted about since time immemorial.

12:56.572 --> 12:59.610
We didn't have the biggest mountains
of the North...

12:59.706 --> 13:02.687
nor the beautiful mountains
of mid-Wales,

13:02.772 --> 13:06.743
but we could claim that we lived
in the shadow of the first mountain...

13:06.839 --> 13:08.750
inside the Welsh border.

13:08.839 --> 13:11.877
These mountains
have defeated every invader.

13:11.973 --> 13:13.884
This is where
the Britons fled...

13:13.973 --> 13:16.476
when they were invaded
by the Romans, the Angles,

13:16.572 --> 13:19.075
the Saxons, the Vikings,
the Normans.

13:19.172 --> 13:23.348
Oh, yes, they all invaded
this island of Britain,

13:23.439 --> 13:25.976
but they've never
taken the mountains from us.

13:26.073 --> 13:29.077
They've never taken
ancient Britain.

13:46.606 --> 13:51.612
My God. Those last
stretches are steeper than they look.

13:51.706 --> 13:54.619
- Yeah.
- I hardly think that your pedometer reading...

13:54.706 --> 13:56.617
will be much use.

13:56.706 --> 14:01.052
Uh, well, not much,
but, uh, nevertheless--

14:01.138 --> 14:06.053
So, can you see either
of our checkpoints from here?

14:06.138 --> 14:08.982
Uh,

14:09.072 --> 14:10.983
n-no.

14:11.072 --> 14:14.053
But I can see
those two men again.

14:14.138 --> 14:16.778
â™ªâ™ª

14:16.873 --> 14:21.845
Rather ominous. Reminds me
of surveying Abyssinia in '88.

14:23.305 --> 14:25.808
Come on, boys.

14:25.873 --> 14:30.413
Any more bets?
This may be your last chance.

14:30.505 --> 14:32.917
2,300.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.418
2,300.

14:35.505 --> 14:38.577
For Williams the Petroleum.
Good man, good man.

14:40.405 --> 14:43.045
Right, Anson.

14:43.138 --> 14:45.118
Oh, uh, well,

14:47.038 --> 14:48.949
same as you,
I imagine.

14:49.038 --> 14:51.018
Mmm, yes.
More or less.

14:51.105 --> 14:53.016
Good.

14:55.439 --> 14:58.909
The very men we need.
Mr. Garrad, sir.

14:59.005 --> 15:02.248
Settle our bet.
How high is our mountain?

15:02.339 --> 15:04.319
I'm sorry.
I can't say yet.

15:04.405 --> 15:07.011
We've only just done
the first recce.

15:07.105 --> 15:10.245
You must have some idea.

15:10.339 --> 15:12.979
Well, nothing accurate
as yet, I'm afraid.

15:14.505 --> 15:16.678
- Good night.
- Night.

15:19.672 --> 15:22.516
Uh, look.

15:22.606 --> 15:26.918
I may be wrong, but after 25 years
of doing this sort of thing, I doubt it.

15:27.005 --> 15:30.851
I would say about 930 feet.

15:32.305 --> 15:34.615
Gentlemen.

15:37.572 --> 15:41.019
- 930?
- 930?

15:45.072 --> 15:47.848
Come in.

15:47.938 --> 15:50.942
- Mr. Anson!
- Oh, Mr. Morgan.

15:51.038 --> 15:53.279
Yes. Perhaps you can help.

15:53.372 --> 15:57.514
Do you know, um, who those two gentlemen
down there in the street are?

15:57.606 --> 15:59.517
They've been
following us all day.

15:59.606 --> 16:02.610
Thomas Twp
and Thomas Twp Too. Local farmers.

16:02.706 --> 16:05.312
They're not quite
with it-- touched.

16:05.405 --> 16:07.851
- Oh.
- Stupid. Twp.

16:07.938 --> 16:11.511
That's Thomas Twp on the left
and his brother, Thomas Twp.

16:13.072 --> 16:16.178
- Sorry?
- Oh, he's Thomas Twp Too.

16:16.272 --> 16:19.685
- He is.
- Or is it the other way round?

16:19.772 --> 16:23.049
W-Well, whichever. Tha-That's fine.
It was just they were, um--

16:23.138 --> 16:26.381
- We were beginning to get a bit worried.
- Oh, quite harmless.

16:26.472 --> 16:28.383
Now I think
I can safely say...

16:28.472 --> 16:31.885
I'm speaking on behalf of all
of my patrons- villagers to a man--

16:31.972 --> 16:35.010
when I say I feel--
we feel--

16:35.105 --> 16:38.951
that your Mr. Garrad's done a pretty
shoddy job measuring Ffynnon Garw,

16:39.038 --> 16:41.541
which is, to any trained eye,
a mountain.

16:41.639 --> 16:44.916
- Beg your pardon?
- Oh. Accepted.

16:45.005 --> 16:48.851
No, no, no, no. I mean-- Sorry.
I-I'm not quite following what you--

16:48.938 --> 16:51.919
930 feet, man?

16:52.005 --> 16:57.079
I hope he doesn't intend sticking to
this obviously euphonious measurement.

16:57.172 --> 17:02.554
No, th-th-the thing is, Mr. Morgan, we haven't
really measured, um, your mountain yet.

17:02.639 --> 17:07.417
We've merely made a preliminary reconnoitre,
which has yielded a very approximate figure.

17:07.505 --> 17:10.781
Click, click,
click, click, click.

17:10.872 --> 17:13.853
- All the way to the top.
- That's it?

17:13.938 --> 17:16.851
- Yep.
- Well, no wonder they bloody got it wrong.

17:19.938 --> 17:25.251
And then finally, um, we'll make
measurements using... this.

17:25.339 --> 17:27.340
Uh, b-but
to use this thing,

17:27.439 --> 17:29.350
which we call
the transit,

17:29.439 --> 17:33.615
we have to be able to clearly view the summits
of Newton Beacon and Whitchurch Hill.

17:33.706 --> 17:37.210
- But they're not mountains.
- No, they're not mountains, Mr. Morgan. They're not.

17:37.305 --> 17:40.115
But Her Majesty's
Ordnance Survey of 1887...

17:40.205 --> 17:42.947
established their heights
and the distance between them...

17:43.038 --> 17:46.281
and the distance between them
and Ffynnon Garw.

17:46.372 --> 17:49.012
And, and, and, um,
given those measurements,

17:49.105 --> 17:53.212
we, we should be able to ascertain
the true height of Ffynnon--

17:53.305 --> 17:55.285
Uh, this elevation.

17:55.372 --> 18:00.515
Ah, so you're saying
it probably isn't 930 feet.

18:00.606 --> 18:05.112
Well, I'd be very surprised if today's
measurement was accurate, yes.

18:05.205 --> 18:08.243
Ah, good.
Well, I'll see you in the bar then.

18:08.339 --> 18:10.512
Yes, yes, yes.
You should bear in mind, Mr. Morgan,

18:10.606 --> 18:15.316
that your, uh, mountain- whatever--
may very well be more than 930 feet.

18:15.405 --> 18:18.682
- Yes!
- But it may also be less.

18:21.938 --> 18:23.849
Less?

18:23.938 --> 18:25.975
No!

18:27.706 --> 18:30.585
All this fuss.
Over what?

18:30.672 --> 18:33.243
Is it a hill?
Is it a mountain?

18:33.339 --> 18:37.185
Perhaps it wouldn't matter
anywhere else, but this is Wales.

18:37.272 --> 18:40.845
The Egyptians built pyramids.
The Greeks built temples.

18:40.938 --> 18:44.818
But we did none of that
because we had mountains.

18:44.905 --> 18:48.614
Yes, the Welsh
were created by mountains.

18:48.706 --> 18:51.687
Where the mountain starts,
there starts Wales.

18:51.771 --> 18:54.081
If this isn't a mountain--

18:54.172 --> 18:58.177
Well, if this isn't a mountain, then Anson
might just as well redraw the border...

18:58.272 --> 19:02.015
and put us all in England,
God forbid.

19:11.972 --> 19:14.452
Good morning, Thomas,
and Thomas.

19:14.539 --> 19:17.452
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- What can I do you for?

19:17.539 --> 19:20.418
We've come to see the men
who are measuring the mountain.

19:22.539 --> 19:24.450
Well, uh, hello.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.110
This is Mr. Garrad,
and, um, my name's Anson.

19:27.205 --> 19:29.947
And as you can see,
we are terribly busy.

19:30.038 --> 19:33.884
This is my brother, Thomas Twp,
and I am Thomas Twp Too.

19:33.972 --> 19:37.510
We've no learning,
and most people say we're twp.

19:37.606 --> 19:40.780
But we're not so twp as to
not know that we're twp.

19:45.038 --> 19:48.850
Well, how novel.
It was very nice to meet you.

19:48.938 --> 19:52.147
We would like to know how you intend
to measure the mountain.

19:52.239 --> 19:55.482
We would like to watch, and we'd
be happy to help carry your rule.

19:55.572 --> 19:58.849
Really? Well, thank you.
That's splendid.

19:58.938 --> 20:01.418
They don't call them
twp for nothin'.

20:46.539 --> 20:49.179
Good God.

20:56.305 --> 20:58.911
Thomas, I'm not
altogether happy...

20:59.005 --> 21:01.781
about you carrying
this equipment for the English.

21:01.872 --> 21:04.580
Are you suitably
rewarded?

21:04.671 --> 21:07.675
I don't know, sir,
but I'll put it down.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.749
- Morning.
- Morning.

21:13.838 --> 21:16.478
We're for the historical
measurement.

21:16.572 --> 21:19.280
Have you met
the Reverend Jones?

21:22.339 --> 21:25.445
N-N-No, no.
How do you do?

21:25.539 --> 21:28.019
You'll do your best now,
I'm sure, hmm?

21:50.339 --> 21:53.013
- Well?
- What's the result?

21:53.105 --> 21:55.346
Please. We have
hours of calculations ahead of us.

21:55.439 --> 21:59.080
I'm afraid you'll have to be a little patient,
but, uh, we should know this evening.

21:59.172 --> 22:01.083
Now, excuse me,
gentlemen.

22:03.205 --> 22:05.116
Oh. Thank you.

22:06.439 --> 22:08.350
Please be careful.

22:08.439 --> 22:13.684
- And how do you know later?
- Well, we've made measurements with those two hills,

22:13.771 --> 22:17.218
and we already know the height
of Newton Beacon and Whitchurch Hill.

22:17.305 --> 22:21.253
- But how were they measured?
- The same way. By comparing them with other hills.

22:21.339 --> 22:23.478
But who measured
the first hill?

22:23.571 --> 22:26.950
Well...
God, my boy. God!

22:28.938 --> 22:31.077
That night, the pub
did big business...

22:31.172 --> 22:33.618
as all gathered
to hear the result.

22:33.705 --> 22:36.879
All except Reverend Jones,
of course,

22:36.972 --> 22:40.112
who wouldn't step into
such a den of iniquity.

22:43.805 --> 22:47.617
- Same again?
- No, I wish to change my bet.

22:47.705 --> 22:51.152
- You can't do that.
- Well, then, I wish to place another one.

22:53.272 --> 22:55.479
- Feeling any better?
- No.

22:55.571 --> 22:59.951
No, I've got a shocking headache.
I think I should lie down.

23:02.038 --> 23:05.417
Do you, um, want me
to tell them then?

23:07.205 --> 23:12.416
That's a splendid idea, although it
really should be me. On the other hand,

23:12.504 --> 23:15.747
this might be a good chance for you
to get practice talking to the natives.

23:15.838 --> 23:19.445
- You don't know when it might be handy.
- Mmm. Yes, of course.

23:21.905 --> 23:25.114
- 980 feet.
- Ah-ah!

23:25.205 --> 23:27.685
Objection "substained."

23:29.005 --> 23:32.680
I'm not takin' any bets
under a thousand feet.

23:32.771 --> 23:35.183
- Traitor.
- Traitor?

23:40.605 --> 23:43.051
Are you sure you haven't got
any English blood in you?

23:50.205 --> 23:52.446
- Any result?
- No!

23:56.605 --> 23:59.142
They're not going
to like it very much, are they?

23:59.239 --> 24:02.550
No. All the same,
these figures are science.

24:02.638 --> 24:04.982
And what is science,
Mr. Anson?

24:05.072 --> 24:06.983
I always forget that one,
don't I?

24:07.072 --> 24:11.214
- Oh, come on.
- Um, science is dispassionate.

24:11.305 --> 24:13.216
Exactly.

24:17.504 --> 24:20.713
Ahem. Ahem!

24:28.138 --> 24:30.209
Oh. Evening.

24:33.605 --> 24:36.916
- Well, Mr. Morgan, with your permission.
- Mm-hmm.

24:37.005 --> 24:40.578
Gentlemen. Um, we have now...

24:40.671 --> 24:43.277
Completed the,
uh, survey of, um,

24:43.372 --> 24:45.613
Ffynnon Garw...

24:45.705 --> 24:48.914
and, um, I have to inform you
that it is...

24:49.005 --> 24:51.451
984 feet.

24:51.538 --> 24:53.916
What?

24:54.005 --> 24:57.885
Now I-I-I realize that this
may be a disappointment to you,

24:57.972 --> 25:01.351
um, but I would ask you to remember
that it is just a measurement...

25:01.438 --> 25:06.751
and in no way should detract from the
beauty of, or indeed your affection for,

25:06.838 --> 25:09.819
this, uh, uh--

25:15.239 --> 25:17.719
H-Hill.
Thank you.

25:21.239 --> 25:23.241
Hill?

25:25.905 --> 25:28.215
A result?
Tell me. Do they have a result?

25:28.305 --> 25:31.286
It's a... hill.

25:35.438 --> 25:37.349
A hill.

25:39.571 --> 25:41.482
Ohh.

25:45.671 --> 25:48.811
Perhaps it would have been different
if there hadn't been a war,

25:48.905 --> 25:53.820
but this was 1917, and
people were exhausted by loss.

25:55.471 --> 25:57.815
Those that were allowed to stay
manned the pits,

25:57.905 --> 26:00.351
mining the coal
that would fuel the ships.

26:00.438 --> 26:03.442
Twenty-four hours a day
they labored.

26:03.538 --> 26:07.145
Corners were cut.
Coal was hacked hastily,

26:07.239 --> 26:11.312
and those who survived
the trenches died for the coal.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.216
It was a sad time.

26:15.305 --> 26:18.343
Our friends had been taken,
our sons, our husbands.

26:18.438 --> 26:22.511
A once-close community
was slowly bein' destroyed.

26:22.605 --> 26:27.076
How could we face those who survived
if they returned to find no mountain?

26:27.172 --> 26:31.712
While they had fought the Germans, we
had lost the mountain to the English?

26:31.805 --> 26:35.947
Our village had been ruined, and now
they were takin' our mountain...

26:36.038 --> 26:38.075
and our Welshness.

26:44.504 --> 26:47.849
- Meeting in the village hall.
- Meeting in the village hall!

26:47.938 --> 26:50.043
Meeting in
the village hall!

26:50.138 --> 26:53.347
Reverend Jones...

26:53.438 --> 26:55.349
is assembling a meeting
in the village hall.

26:55.438 --> 26:58.647
- Now!
- What does that old coot think he's gonna do?

26:58.738 --> 27:02.208
- Raise the mountain?
- He's gonna organize an official complaint.

27:02.304 --> 27:05.183
Come on, boys.
Were you comin'?

27:05.271 --> 27:08.115
A complaint?

27:15.705 --> 27:18.914
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

27:19.005 --> 27:23.044
Look, I propose
a petition...

27:23.138 --> 27:26.779
demanding the inclusion
of Ffynnon Garw...

27:26.872 --> 27:30.445
as the first mountain
in Wales,

27:30.538 --> 27:35.351
to be included on all
of His Majesty's maps.

27:42.605 --> 27:47.076
And who's gonna read this petition?
Huh? Who's going to agree?

27:47.172 --> 27:50.415
- I don't think I need any advice from you, Mr. Morgan.
- I haven't finished.

27:50.938 --> 27:52.747
I haven't finished yet.

27:52.771 --> 27:56.275
I don't want Ffynnon Garw
to be on the map...

27:56.371 --> 28:00.080
because we begged for it,
because we-- we pleaded.

28:00.172 --> 28:03.619
No! If Ffynnon Garw
has to be a thousand feet,

28:03.705 --> 28:06.015
then I say
let it be a thousand feet!

28:06.105 --> 28:09.678
Twenty feet!
That's all we need!

28:09.771 --> 28:12.513
A 20-foot tump
and we have our mountain.

28:12.605 --> 28:16.280
- I'm not sure how legal that is.
- Yes. Or ethical.

28:16.371 --> 28:18.282
"Legal"? "Ethical"?

28:18.371 --> 28:22.285
How legal was it to say that
a thousand feet is a mountain...

28:22.371 --> 28:24.851
and 984 isn't, huh?

28:24.938 --> 28:30.251
Do we call a short man a boy
or, or, or a small dog a cat?

28:30.338 --> 28:32.841
No!

28:32.938 --> 28:35.817
This is a mountain--
our mountain--

28:35.905 --> 28:40.376
and if it needs to be a thousand feet, then
by God, let's make it a thousand feet.

28:40.471 --> 28:43.008
I would prefer it,
Mr. Morgan,

28:43.105 --> 28:46.245
if you did not take
the Lord's name in vain.

28:46.338 --> 28:48.340
Ye-Yes, Ivor, go on.
Have a go.

28:49.671 --> 28:54.313
Uh... Morgan the Goat--

28:56.138 --> 28:58.709
Sorry, Morgan.

28:58.805 --> 29:02.048
Morgan has a point.

29:02.137 --> 29:06.779
I have visited mountains that are topped
by ancient burial chambers,

29:06.872 --> 29:11.014
and it is that full height
which is measured.

29:11.105 --> 29:15.884
I see nothing wrong with
adding to Ffynnon Garw.

29:15.972 --> 29:18.213
In Rhondda Fawr,

29:18.304 --> 29:22.013
there's a huge coal tip above
the village, and that's on the maps.

29:25.204 --> 29:29.448
Am I the only one that thinks
this smacks of sharp practice--

29:29.538 --> 29:31.449
of cheating?

29:31.538 --> 29:35.850
What do we do? Lower one part
of Ffynnon Garw to raise another?

29:35.938 --> 29:38.942
Take it from your garden if
it makes you feel better.

29:39.038 --> 29:42.645
Yes! Yes! It would
make me feel better.

29:42.738 --> 29:44.684
I would be happier...

29:44.771 --> 29:49.049
if the mountain was raised
by toil, by sweat,

29:49.137 --> 29:51.447
by work,
by sacrifice.

29:51.538 --> 29:55.884
Yes! Take the earth
from our own gardens.

29:55.972 --> 30:00.182
- That would make me feel better.
- You're just making it impossible.

30:00.271 --> 30:02.842
No, Mr. Morgan,
I am not!

30:02.938 --> 30:04.849
Oh, that man.

30:10.605 --> 30:12.516
J-Johnny.

30:20.838 --> 30:23.011
- Well, this is--
- No, listen.

30:25.738 --> 30:28.116
In France--

30:28.204 --> 30:31.583
In France, we dug trenches
ten miles long.

30:34.104 --> 30:37.483
We took earth from here
and built hills there.

30:37.571 --> 30:41.018
We moved fields.
You wouldn't believe what we did.

30:47.071 --> 30:49.745
It's possible.
It's just hard work.

30:49.838 --> 30:51.749
I'll help.

30:54.438 --> 30:57.044
And that's how
it all started.

30:57.137 --> 31:01.483
The Reverend had an idea, but Morgan had a
better one, which the Reverend altered...

31:01.571 --> 31:04.142
and Johnny believed possible.

31:04.238 --> 31:07.378
Of course, it didn't change the fact
that Morgan the Goat...

31:07.471 --> 31:09.382
wouldn't talk
to Reverend Jones...

31:09.471 --> 31:12.611
and Reverend Jones
wouldn't talk to Morgan the Goat.

31:12.705 --> 31:15.584
And Johnny could rarely
talk to anyone.

31:23.605 --> 31:25.243
Sergeant.

31:25.338 --> 31:27.716
- Gentlemen.
- Mr. Anson.

31:27.805 --> 31:31.651
On behalf of the village, we would like
to convince you to persuade Mr. Garrad...

31:31.738 --> 31:35.413
to stay longer and
measure the mountain again.

31:35.504 --> 31:40.078
Again? Well, I-I'm sorry, but I think
today's reading was accurate.

31:40.171 --> 31:43.812
We're going to add
20 feet.

31:43.905 --> 31:47.114
- What do you mean add 20 feet?
- 'Tis legal, isn't it?

31:47.204 --> 31:51.346
Heights of other mountains
sometimes include burial mounds.

31:51.438 --> 31:54.442
- Even coal tips.
- Aye!
- Uh, well, now that is true--

31:54.538 --> 31:57.178
that permanent features
are sometimes allowed, but, uh--

31:57.271 --> 31:59.774
Good.
Twenty feet it is then.

31:59.872 --> 32:02.546
We can't possibly wait
while you, uh,

32:05.071 --> 32:06.982
add 20-- 20 feet.

32:07.071 --> 32:10.075
- I mean, how are you going to do this?
- Never you mind.

32:10.171 --> 32:13.152
We'll manage. You just
convince Mr. Garrad.

32:13.238 --> 32:16.583
Uh, n-no, I know
I'd be wasting my breath.

32:16.671 --> 32:20.278
We have a very tight schedule, and, um,
Mr. Garrad's very eager to get on.

32:20.371 --> 32:24.114
- All we're asking--
- No, it's very late, so if you don't mind,

32:24.204 --> 32:26.115
we will be leaving
first thing in the morning.

32:26.204 --> 32:28.184
Thank you.

32:31.538 --> 32:35.611
- Aye, it's a damn shame, man.
- Don't worry. They're not goin' anywhere.

32:35.705 --> 32:38.686
Sorry, Morgan?
I missed that.

32:38.771 --> 32:41.251
I must be goin' deaf
in this ear, man.

32:41.338 --> 32:44.251
- I said good night, Sergeant.
- Aye, aye.

32:44.338 --> 32:46.249
Good night now.

32:47.404 --> 32:49.748
- Morgan?
- I need two pounds of sugar.

32:49.838 --> 32:52.045
- Two pounds!
- Shh!

32:52.137 --> 32:55.175
- It's rationed.
- I know it's rationed.

32:55.271 --> 32:58.616
Come on, Ivor.
This is a national emergency.

32:58.705 --> 33:01.686
Yes, but...
two pounds?

33:01.771 --> 33:05.685
I don't want to have to tell people
that it failed because of you, Ivor.

33:12.705 --> 33:14.946
So, are they stayin'?

33:15.037 --> 33:18.712
Oh, I, uh, I think
I won them over, my love.

33:18.805 --> 33:20.716
I think I won them over.

33:24.338 --> 33:26.579
For God's sake, Anson,
crank harder.

33:26.671 --> 33:29.880
I am doing my very best.
Perhaps you'd like to have a try.

33:29.971 --> 33:32.281
I'd hate for you to have to
exert yourself a little bit.

33:32.371 --> 33:34.282
What did you say?

33:37.204 --> 33:39.115
Trouble, gentlemen?

33:40.204 --> 33:42.741
Uh, yes.
I'm afraid so.

33:42.838 --> 33:45.512
Oh. Dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear.

33:45.605 --> 33:47.949
Uh, Mr. Morgan.
By the way,

33:48.037 --> 33:51.484
I was wondering: What happened
to the, uh, the flagpole?

33:52.571 --> 33:54.573
Dry rot.

33:54.671 --> 33:58.585
Dry rot?
In Wales?

34:10.605 --> 34:14.951
- That looks more than 20 foot, man.
- Oh, it's 20.

34:15.036 --> 34:20.679
- Bloody hell. We're gonna need a
lot of earth to cover that.
- Aye.

34:22.071 --> 34:25.382
It is not 9:00--

34:25.471 --> 34:29.418
- Good morning.
- Reverend Jones.

34:30.504 --> 34:33.451
Uh, am I disturbing you?

34:33.538 --> 34:36.882
I thought you were
one of the children.

34:36.971 --> 34:38.882
Oh.

34:38.971 --> 34:41.315
Ah.

34:41.404 --> 34:44.248
Just what we need
to talk about.

34:44.338 --> 34:47.251
Today is
an historic day.

34:47.338 --> 34:49.545
Historic!

34:49.638 --> 34:53.279
A day which generations
will talk about...

34:53.371 --> 34:55.282
for years to come!

34:56.804 --> 34:59.375
- Is there news from the front?
- No.

34:59.471 --> 35:01.883
The news is here.

35:03.071 --> 35:05.517
The news is up there.

35:08.037 --> 35:10.074
Today...

35:10.171 --> 35:13.448
we are building
a mountain!

35:13.538 --> 35:16.747
And I want your pupils
to help.

35:16.837 --> 35:19.113
My pupils.
To labor.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.775
To help you falsify
the height of a--

35:21.871 --> 35:25.444
To falsify?
Oh, Mr. Davies,

35:25.538 --> 35:30.317
both your sense of community
and your vocabulary...

35:30.404 --> 35:32.350
leave much
to be desired.

35:34.871 --> 35:37.112
So?

35:38.271 --> 35:40.911
Ahem.
Well, um--

35:41.004 --> 35:43.382
Well what?

35:43.471 --> 35:46.315
Well, difficult to tell.

35:46.404 --> 35:49.317
And by now,
you've probably flooded it.

35:49.404 --> 35:51.315
We'd best leave it
for ten minutes.

35:53.004 --> 35:54.915
Fancy a drink?

36:20.404 --> 36:22.714
Forgive me, Lord.

36:22.804 --> 36:25.580
Sh-shh--

36:25.671 --> 36:28.652
No, they know not
what they do, as you said.

36:30.704 --> 36:33.446
â™ª Bread of heaven â™ª

36:33.538 --> 36:36.610
â™ª Bread of heaven â™ªâ™ª

36:38.605 --> 36:42.610
There you are. I've been standin'
at that bar like a lemon.

36:42.704 --> 36:44.706
I'm busy.
Refreshments.

36:44.804 --> 36:47.876
- Hey, get that.
- Ahem.

36:47.971 --> 36:50.781
- What shall I say to them?
- Don't say anything.

36:50.871 --> 36:53.715
Just push it to the garage
and take the engine apart.

36:53.804 --> 36:56.842
Yeah, but I've never taken one of these
apart. It isn't a two-stroke.

36:56.937 --> 37:01.943
- Now's your chance to learn.
- What if I can't put it back together again?

37:02.037 --> 37:04.847
You'll have done
a great service.

37:08.504 --> 37:11.883
All right, let's get this down
to the garage, eh?

37:11.971 --> 37:14.247
Ah, bloody hell.

37:14.338 --> 37:17.410
- Quite.
- When it rains it pours, eh?

37:17.504 --> 37:20.110
So, do you know
who's behind this?

37:21.504 --> 37:23.848
I don't know what
you're suggesting.

37:23.937 --> 37:25.974
What I am suggesting,
Mr. Williams,

37:26.071 --> 37:29.075
is that our problems
seem highly coincidental...

37:29.171 --> 37:32.448
with my qualification
of your mountain as a hill.

37:32.538 --> 37:36.486
I am beginning to suspect
childish revenge, bad sportsmanship--

37:36.571 --> 37:40.576
Stop! Now stop before you say
something that you will regret.

37:40.670 --> 37:44.083
Yes, it's true
a lot of people are upset,

37:44.171 --> 37:46.082
but to think that
anyone would--

37:47.304 --> 37:50.945
Mr. Garrad, sir,
we are an honorable people.

37:52.171 --> 37:55.209
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

37:55.304 --> 37:57.784
It just seems
very, very odd.

37:57.871 --> 38:02.081
Well, let's forget that for now,
get this down to the garage.

38:02.171 --> 38:06.551
And, um, how long do you think
the repairs will take exactly?

38:06.637 --> 38:09.379
Oh, I'll, uh--
I'll have you on your way in no time.

38:09.471 --> 38:13.283
Good. Because otherwise, we shall
have to make alternative arrangements.

38:13.371 --> 38:15.317
No need for that,
gentlemen.

38:15.404 --> 38:17.850
Now if you'd kindly
remove your luggage...

38:17.937 --> 38:20.713
and push me.

38:20.804 --> 38:22.715
Push?

38:24.438 --> 38:26.349
Push.

38:40.204 --> 38:43.083
- Tommy in?
- He's sleepin'. Night shift.

38:43.171 --> 38:46.778
- I have to see him.
- He's not going anywhere for you.

38:46.871 --> 38:49.613
Wake him, woman!
This is a matter of life and death!

39:12.537 --> 39:16.007
Oh, very good, very good.
Excellent.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.209
- Three buckets. Excellent, excellent.
- Hello, hello.

39:18.304 --> 39:22.013
- We've chosen a hot day for it.
- Oh, better than rain.

39:22.104 --> 39:24.209
But it's going
to rain later.

39:26.737 --> 39:30.275
Well, all the better
to refresh us, you see.

39:30.371 --> 39:33.477
Be optimistic. Now go on. Dig.
Fill that third one, quick.

39:35.503 --> 39:38.245
Ask some house on the way into Cardiff.
You can't miss it.

39:38.338 --> 39:40.249
But, Morgan,
I'm workin' nights.

39:40.338 --> 39:43.376
There's some of us
workin' day and night.

39:43.471 --> 39:46.816
I don't want to be telling people it all
failed because of Tommy Twostroke.

40:03.704 --> 40:05.684
Capital, capital.

40:05.770 --> 40:09.684
Right. Let me
just get my tools.

40:09.770 --> 40:12.876
And when we were talking about Llywelyn
the Last, you will remember that--

40:12.971 --> 40:15.076
Come in.

40:17.338 --> 40:20.319
- We've come for the children.
- We need them at home.

40:21.804 --> 40:23.977
Well, this is most irregular.

40:56.904 --> 41:00.181
Refreshments!
Anyone in need of refreshments?

41:17.670 --> 41:19.581
Ahem.

41:23.670 --> 41:26.742
Go on.
Go on home.

42:10.871 --> 42:14.614
I can't say I like this village.
It's altogether far too quiet.

42:16.104 --> 42:18.607
Yes, I noticed.
I rather like it.

42:21.937 --> 42:24.645
Do you think he has a clue
about what he's doing?

42:26.937 --> 42:29.247
Well, h-h-he's certainly
stripping it with great confidence.

42:29.337 --> 42:32.181
- I know, but--
- I'm afraid I don't know the first thing about motorcars.

42:32.271 --> 42:34.478
Unfortunately,
neither do I.

42:36.570 --> 42:41.144
Aha! I think, gentlemen,
I've found the problem.

42:42.904 --> 42:44.815
Ahem. Yeah.

42:47.570 --> 42:49.675
And what's that?

42:49.770 --> 42:52.717
Well, I don't know
the English word, but in Welsh,

42:52.804 --> 42:55.284
we call it a--
a bethangalw.

42:55.370 --> 42:57.748
- A what?
- A "bairthandgaloo."

42:57.837 --> 43:01.649
- Yeah. Close enough.
- And, um, where can we get a replacement?

43:01.737 --> 43:04.684
- Ooh, Cardiff.
- Cardiff!

43:04.770 --> 43:07.944
We'll send Tommy Twostroke
when he gets back.

43:10.171 --> 43:12.082
Right.

43:30.270 --> 43:32.181
- Tommy!
- I thought that--

43:32.270 --> 43:34.272
Never mind what you thought.
What the hell are you doin' here?

43:34.370 --> 43:37.579
- Morgan sent me.
- What does Morgan want? It's Thursday. I've got my work.

43:37.670 --> 43:41.015
- He wants you to come right away.
- And lose my job?

43:41.104 --> 43:45.348
It's an emergency. He said,
"Tell her I can't do it without her."

43:48.937 --> 43:52.908
- Can't do without me?
- Mmm, something like that.

44:01.337 --> 44:04.341
Ha'penny change.
Thank you.

44:04.437 --> 44:08.852
- Ah! Mornin', Reverend.
- Don't you "Good mornin', Reverend" me.

44:08.937 --> 44:11.144
This is typical.

44:11.237 --> 44:16.516
While the entire village-- with the
notable exception of Davies the School--

44:16.604 --> 44:19.608
toil in this heroic task,

44:19.704 --> 44:24.744
you have applied your labor
to, to, to making a profit...

44:24.837 --> 44:30.116
and to further disseminating
the evil of alcohol.

44:30.203 --> 44:33.616
Now, now, Reverend. I think the heat is
getting to your good temper.

44:33.704 --> 44:36.651
I'm supplyin' a service.

44:36.737 --> 44:40.412
A true service
would be free.

44:40.503 --> 44:42.505
Trust me.
I'm making no profit.

44:42.604 --> 44:44.811
Oh-ho-ho, dear.

44:44.904 --> 44:49.011
Trust you?
The day has yet to dawn...

44:49.104 --> 44:52.051
when I will trust you.

44:52.503 --> 44:55.347
Oh, come on, George.
It's not the end of the world.

44:55.470 --> 44:58.383
Just means we'll have to
stay here for another few days.

45:00.904 --> 45:03.612
Is there any transport
for hire at all?

45:03.704 --> 45:06.878
No, everything's
being used, um, for the, uh--

45:07.770 --> 45:10.182
Yes? For the what?

45:11.370 --> 45:14.180
- The war.
- Oh, the war. Yes.

45:14.270 --> 45:16.181
I thought I heard
a train last night.

45:16.270 --> 45:18.841
So is there
a railway station here?

45:18.937 --> 45:21.645
- Well, uh--
- It's a simple question.

45:21.737 --> 45:24.877
Is there or is there not
a railway station?

45:24.971 --> 45:27.383
Well, not really.

45:27.470 --> 45:29.973
Not really?

45:47.971 --> 45:51.180
- Ah. Morning.
- Oh.

45:51.270 --> 45:53.773
Do you have
a train timetable?

45:55.704 --> 45:58.378
- Trains?
- Yes, trains.

45:58.470 --> 46:01.212
Uh, you're English, are you?

46:01.303 --> 46:03.214
Anson?

46:04.237 --> 46:07.218
Uh, yes.
Yes, we are, yes. Um,

46:07.303 --> 46:09.544
and we-- we'd like
to catch a train.

46:09.637 --> 46:12.447
Ah. No trains.

46:12.537 --> 46:14.448
Good God, man,
I just heard one.

46:14.537 --> 46:19.179
They're coal. There's coal trains
all day, coal trains all night.

46:19.270 --> 46:21.341
But no passenger trains.

46:21.437 --> 46:26.182
Don't see any passengers, do you?

46:26.270 --> 46:28.944
Meat pies!

46:29.037 --> 46:31.881
apples! Pears!

47:42.437 --> 47:44.348
Now, now.

47:44.437 --> 47:48.214
The Good Lord took a day
to divide heaven and earth.

47:48.303 --> 47:50.749
We can't expect
to do better.

47:50.837 --> 47:53.545
And, and, and we've broken
the back of it.

47:53.637 --> 47:56.584
- That's the important thing.
- We haven't broken the back of it.

47:56.670 --> 47:58.581
Yes, we have.

47:58.670 --> 48:01.412
We're almost
up to 14 feet.

48:01.503 --> 48:03.813
We'll need more as we get higher
and the base grows wider.

48:03.904 --> 48:06.612
- He's right.
- Oh!

48:06.704 --> 48:09.378
Pessimists, all of you.
And you!

48:11.503 --> 48:15.007
- You! You said it would rain.
- And it will.

48:15.103 --> 48:17.242
God, dear. Ohh.

48:29.704 --> 48:31.911
Morgan, what the devil's goin' on?
I have Tommy Twostroke...

48:33.103 --> 48:35.481
comin' to the house
with a desperate message.

48:35.570 --> 48:38.176
Desperate!
That's the word, Betty.

48:38.270 --> 48:41.843
Desperate times, desperate measures,
desperate Englishmen.

48:43.437 --> 48:48.011
You had better not be suggestin'
what I think you're suggestin'.

48:52.270 --> 48:55.012
Oh. Hello.

48:55.103 --> 48:57.014
Um--

48:57.103 --> 48:59.709
Sorry. Could I, um,
possibly have a glass of beer?

48:59.804 --> 49:02.717
- Do I look like a barmaid?
- Barmaid? Never!

49:02.804 --> 49:05.410
I'm surprised at you, Mr. Anson,
makin' a mistake like that.

49:05.503 --> 49:09.349
This is our honored guest,
Miss Elizabeth.

49:09.437 --> 49:12.384
I'm sorry. I simply assumed
because you were behind the bar--

49:12.470 --> 49:17.818
Well, I like my regulars to feel that this isn't a pub.
It's a home away from home.

49:17.904 --> 49:20.407
- Home?
- Back so soon? Shame.

49:20.503 --> 49:23.916
Difficulty with the breathing again?
Terrible trouble with her chest.

49:24.003 --> 49:27.416
I knew you were returnin' to Cardiff
too soon. I told you so.

49:27.503 --> 49:29.915
She soldiers on
under adversity.

49:30.003 --> 49:32.483
What can I get you
to drink, huh?

49:34.170 --> 49:36.480
- Pint of bitter, please.
- Coming up.

49:36.570 --> 49:38.675
And put it
on my account.

49:38.770 --> 49:40.772
Your account?

49:40.871 --> 49:44.182
To show there's
no hard feelings.

49:45.837 --> 49:49.182
Oh, really, there's
no need for that.

49:49.270 --> 49:51.944
Thank you anyway.
Um, Reginald Anson.

49:52.036 --> 49:55.017
Elizabeth. Miss.
And it would be my pleasure.

49:55.103 --> 49:59.381
Well, there. Enjoy your drinks.
I'm sure you've a lot to talk about.

49:59.470 --> 50:01.381
Oh--

50:02.970 --> 50:05.280
Uh, I'm afraid
Mr. Morgan...

50:05.370 --> 50:09.409
does so like to discuss
one's private matters in public.

50:09.503 --> 50:12.109
Terribly bad taste,
I find.

50:12.203 --> 50:14.911
Quite common.

50:15.003 --> 50:18.951
Well-- You can
rely on me for complete discretion.

50:19.036 --> 50:22.483
I'm sure. Now,
would you excuse me?

50:24.470 --> 50:28.850
I gave up my first
real, honest job!

50:28.936 --> 50:30.847
Mr. Garrad, sir!

50:30.936 --> 50:33.041
Ah, excuse me.

50:35.003 --> 50:37.244
What can I do you for?

50:45.903 --> 50:49.248
- Anson. There's
dirty work at the crossroads.
- Hmm?

50:49.337 --> 50:52.318
I just spoke to Morgan
about staying another night,

50:52.403 --> 50:54.940
and he wasn't
the least bit surprised.

50:55.036 --> 50:57.710
Oh, no, no, no.
You shouldn't jump to conclusions.

50:57.804 --> 51:01.684
Williams the Garage Man had already
told him that the car was inoperable.

51:01.770 --> 51:04.649
He had?
Oh, I see.

51:04.737 --> 51:07.980
One can't be too careful
in foreign climes.

51:08.070 --> 51:11.847
- Well, it's only Wales, George.
- It's still foreign, Reginald.

51:11.936 --> 51:14.678
I understand.
I-I do! Completely!

51:14.770 --> 51:16.772
Especially
since they are English.

51:16.870 --> 51:18.781
Morgan, you're
missing the point.

51:18.870 --> 51:20.781
No, you are missin'
the point, girl.

51:20.870 --> 51:24.147
All you have to do
is charm the old fool...

51:24.237 --> 51:26.342
so his days
don't seem so empty.

51:26.437 --> 51:28.781
Morgan, your head's empty.

51:31.136 --> 51:33.616
All this for just a map!

51:33.704 --> 51:36.810
Just a map?
Is that what Tommy Twostroke said?

51:36.903 --> 51:39.406
Half-wit!
Just a map!

51:40.870 --> 51:44.682
Maps, dear Betty,
are the--

51:44.769 --> 51:48.114
uh, the undergarments
of a country.

51:48.203 --> 51:52.413
- They give shape to continents.
- You--!

51:59.070 --> 52:02.210
Oh, George.
L-Let me introduce you.

52:02.303 --> 52:05.978
This is, um,
Miss Elizabeth from Cardiff.

52:06.070 --> 52:08.414
Come for the good
mountain air.

52:08.503 --> 52:10.414
And this is
Mr. George Garrad.

52:10.503 --> 52:12.278
- Pleased to meet you.
- I'm sure.

52:29.936 --> 52:32.143
Damn and blast!
Oh, God.

52:39.437 --> 52:41.348
I said it would.

52:43.237 --> 52:46.741
By God, it reminds me
of the monsoons in the tropics.

52:49.470 --> 52:51.780
So have you ever been
to the tropics?

52:54.437 --> 52:56.348
Excuse me.

52:57.703 --> 53:00.343
Awful mud slides
on nights like these.

53:13.769 --> 53:17.581
Williams! Williams!

53:17.669 --> 53:21.242
- Morgan?
- We need tarpaulins up the mountain, quick.

53:21.337 --> 53:23.283
All our work
will be washed away!

53:23.370 --> 53:25.475
- That's the only one I've got.
- Right. That'll do.

53:25.570 --> 53:29.916
- Morgan!
- Get Johnny Shellshocked and get up the mountain, quick!

53:30.003 --> 53:34.509
- But, Morgan!
- Well, I can't do it all myself.

53:34.604 --> 53:38.142
Do you want me to have to tell people
it all failed because of you?

53:42.769 --> 53:47.240
We're nearly there,
Johnny boy, nearly there.

53:54.936 --> 53:58.474
Get down!

54:04.803 --> 54:07.716
Get down, Johnny,
you bloody idiot! Lightnin'!

54:07.803 --> 54:11.273
Get down!
Come on! Come on!

54:14.636 --> 54:16.809
Come on!
Come on!

54:18.470 --> 54:21.144
All right.
All right.

54:21.237 --> 54:24.514
Calm down. Calm down. Shh! Come on.

54:24.603 --> 54:29.109
Good boy.
You can get up now. Come on.

55:01.870 --> 55:05.181
So we forged through Palestine,
and then from there,

55:05.270 --> 55:10.276
on into Cairo, and finally
from there, we went on into Aden.

55:10.370 --> 55:12.748
D'you hear that,
Miss Elizabeth?

55:12.836 --> 55:15.976
Mr. Garrad's
been to Aden.

55:16.070 --> 55:17.981
Aden?

55:20.337 --> 55:23.079
Have you been to Aden,
Mr. Anson?

55:23.170 --> 55:27.175
Uh, no, no.

55:27.270 --> 55:29.375
Not yet, but I-I--
it sounds fascinating.

55:29.470 --> 55:31.416
Another for you,
Mr. Garrad?

55:32.870 --> 55:34.872
You all right there,
Mr. Anson?

55:34.970 --> 55:38.213
- Mmm.
- I'll have another.

55:38.303 --> 55:42.911
And one for Mr. Anson.
And put them on my account.

55:43.003 --> 55:47.179
Thank you very much. How charming to be
treated to a drink by a lady.

55:47.270 --> 55:51.184
Oh, Miss Elizabeth's
benevolence knows no bounds.

55:55.170 --> 55:59.016
- Bloody hell.
- It was only soddin' thunder and bloody lightnin', weren't it?

55:59.103 --> 56:01.709
Drove the poor bugger
half mad.

56:03.703 --> 56:07.446
- What about the mound?
- Oh, we saved your mound all right.

56:09.370 --> 56:12.010
You can't leave him here.
You should take him to Blod's.

56:12.103 --> 56:14.845
I've done enough
for one night.

56:23.203 --> 56:25.114
Get some towels
and a blanket, quickly.

56:25.203 --> 56:28.207
Damn shame, poor chap. I saw a lot
of this sort of thing in Sebastopol.

56:28.303 --> 56:30.874
Bugger Sebastopol, George.
Give me your jacket.

56:32.669 --> 56:36.173
Come on! A large brandy,
please. Quickly.

56:36.270 --> 56:38.682
Right. Unclench
his fingers.

56:38.769 --> 56:42.046
Undo his shirt. Get his shirt undone and
unclench his fingers. All right, all right.

56:42.136 --> 56:44.275
Let me see if he's
swallowed his tongue.

56:44.370 --> 56:47.579
That's it. Come on.
There. Just relax.

56:51.136 --> 56:54.083
- Blod!
- What have you done with him?

56:54.170 --> 56:56.081
I didn't do anythin'!

56:57.270 --> 56:59.341
Betty, give the man
the brandy.

56:59.437 --> 57:03.681
Betty? So this is Betty?
What the bloody hell is she doing here?

57:03.769 --> 57:07.376
No, Blod, you-- Don't get
the wrong idea. This is another lady.

57:07.469 --> 57:10.746
With these gentlemen.
Isn't that right?

57:13.469 --> 57:18.111
Uh, yes, yes, we're from London. Now can we
please get on with helping this poor fellow?

57:18.203 --> 57:21.343
- He's in deep shook. There.
- I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else.

57:21.436 --> 57:24.383
Come on, Morgan. Help me get him home.
I know what to do.

57:24.469 --> 57:26.380
All right.
Gently, gently.

57:45.970 --> 57:50.476
Well, I've had far too much
excitement for one evening.

57:50.536 --> 57:55.212
If you'll excuse me,
I'll say... good night.

57:55.303 --> 57:57.214
- Yeah, but, George--
- Good night!

58:18.569 --> 58:22.813
Oh, don't worry about Morgan. This isn't
the first time I've looked after him.

58:22.903 --> 58:25.315
He won't be back
tonight.

58:28.237 --> 58:30.148
And thank you...

58:30.237 --> 58:32.217
for helpin' me with Blod.

58:34.870 --> 58:38.079
Oh, it's fine.

58:38.170 --> 58:41.845
Just, uh, seemed the--
Seemed the thing to do, really.

58:54.336 --> 58:58.648
I mean that.
Thank you.

58:58.736 --> 59:00.647
That's fine.

59:08.402 --> 59:10.313
Good.

59:12.703 --> 59:18.585
Well, um, good night,
uh, Miss Elizabeth, and, uh--

59:18.669 --> 59:21.548
Betty.

59:21.636 --> 59:24.082
Betty. Yes. Um,

59:24.170 --> 59:27.811
and, uh, thank you for
a lovely evening, and, uh--

59:27.903 --> 59:30.281
Are you married?

59:30.369 --> 59:33.907
- I'm sorry?
- Are you married?

59:34.003 --> 59:35.914
No.

59:40.003 --> 59:41.914
Good night, Mr. Anson.

59:43.836 --> 59:46.680
You're a gentleman.

01:00:01.703 --> 01:00:03.614
Idiot.

01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:21.583
- Sleepin' quietly?
- No thanks to you.

01:00:21.669 --> 01:00:24.411
Well, I'll just go back and lock up.
I won't be long.

01:00:24.502 --> 01:00:27.915
Don't think for one minute
that you're stayin' here tonight.

01:00:28.003 --> 01:00:30.005
- After what you've done to Johnny?
- Blod.

01:00:30.103 --> 01:00:33.710
And another thing, Morgan.
If this was all for nothin',

01:00:33.803 --> 01:00:37.444
don't think about darkenin'
my door ever again.

01:00:37.536 --> 01:00:40.449
- Don't be rash now, girl.
- Bugger off, Morgan.

01:00:43.269 --> 01:00:45.909
Oh, no!

01:00:54.369 --> 01:00:56.280
Betty!

01:01:01.703 --> 01:01:03.649
Damn and blast!

01:01:34.003 --> 01:01:36.244
Good mornin'.
Couldn't you sleep?

01:01:36.336 --> 01:01:38.247
I slept like a log.

01:01:38.336 --> 01:01:41.715
It's so quiet without
Morgan bangin' around.

01:01:41.803 --> 01:01:44.044
Morning.

01:01:44.136 --> 01:01:46.309
I thought you might
already have gone.

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:48.473
You seemed rather impatient
last night.

01:01:48.569 --> 01:01:53.348
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not one
for runnin' around in the rain.

01:01:53.436 --> 01:01:56.883
I like to stay snug
in a warm bed and just stare at it.

01:01:58.769 --> 01:02:02.808
- Mm-hmm.
- Everythin' looks better when it's wet, don't you think?

01:02:09.836 --> 01:02:11.941
- Mm!
- Are you hungry?

01:02:12.036 --> 01:02:15.279
Were you lookin'
for somethin' to eat?

01:02:15.369 --> 01:02:19.476
- I'm fami-- famished. I'm famished.
- Yes, you look hungry.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.571
- Ah!
- George.

01:02:21.669 --> 01:02:23.706
Ah. Excuse me.

01:02:23.803 --> 01:02:26.249
Thank you.

01:02:26.336 --> 01:02:30.250
Right, Anson, the order of the day:
sort out this motorcar. Anson!

01:02:30.336 --> 01:02:33.180
- Yes?
- We can't be sitting around here forever...

01:02:33.269 --> 01:02:35.943
waiting for some joker
on a motorcycle.

01:02:36.036 --> 01:02:40.883
- We should be off.
- Back into England or further into Wales?

01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:44.315
Uh, well, to the north, north,
north into Wales, really.

01:02:44.402 --> 01:02:48.646
If it's rainin' here, it's rainin' more
there. You might as well wait here.

01:02:51.636 --> 01:02:53.673
And the inns
in North Wales-- Ugh!

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:56.909
- Come on, girl. Let me in.
- Like sleepin' in stables.

01:02:59.269 --> 01:03:02.216
I'm so wet I'm melting.
Ah. Mornin'.

01:03:02.302 --> 01:03:04.748
Morning.

01:03:10.569 --> 01:03:12.606
- So?
- So what?

01:03:12.703 --> 01:03:17.243
You know! Last night.
Miss Elizabeth and the English.

01:03:23.102 --> 01:03:27.050
Firstly, Miss Elizabeth
died in her sleep;

01:03:27.135 --> 01:03:31.311
and secondly, they're
not animals like you, Morgan.

01:03:31.402 --> 01:03:33.245
They're gentlemen.

01:03:43.803 --> 01:03:45.714
An animal.

01:03:55.803 --> 01:03:59.307
You're not very good at this, are you?
Come on. Concentrate.

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:02.474
That fool said he'd
be here by 11:00.

01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:06.540
"I'll have some news," he said. "I'll
have the part from Cardiff," he said.

01:04:06.636 --> 01:04:09.344
It's almost sodding noon!

01:04:09.436 --> 01:04:11.347
God, I hate the Welsh.

01:04:12.703 --> 01:04:14.683
The roads are probably
bad with the rain.

01:04:17.803 --> 01:04:19.714
Well, come on, Anson.

01:04:19.803 --> 01:04:22.147
Hmm?

01:04:22.236 --> 01:04:24.147
Sorry. Wh-Where
are we going?

01:04:24.236 --> 01:04:28.207
Well, where the hell
do you think? To get the car.

01:04:28.302 --> 01:04:30.976
To get the car.
To get the car. Yes. Yes.

01:04:34.936 --> 01:04:38.247
The truth is that,
while we Welsh like to believe...

01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:41.216
that it was the mountains that
beat the successive invaders,

01:04:41.302 --> 01:04:45.307
it was, really, the weather
that comes with mountains.

01:04:45.402 --> 01:04:49.373
- It was the rain that defeated every invader.
- Anson!

01:04:49.469 --> 01:04:52.382
Yes, simple rain.

01:05:17.502 --> 01:05:20.745
- Yes, sir?
- I would like--

01:05:20.836 --> 01:05:24.807
Oh, God. Anson.

01:05:24.903 --> 01:05:27.042
- We'd like to send a telegram, please.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:32.969 --> 01:05:35.711
I have been advised
by my department...

01:05:35.803 --> 01:05:39.012
that I can take a train
from here to Pontypridd.

01:05:41.603 --> 01:05:45.210
- A passenger train.
- Yes.

01:05:45.302 --> 01:05:48.215
But you told me that
there were no passenger trains.

01:05:48.302 --> 01:05:52.478
Going east. I didn't know
you wanted to go north.

01:05:52.569 --> 01:05:55.015
Why did you assume
that I wanted to go east?

01:05:55.102 --> 01:05:58.982
You're English,
and England is... east.

01:06:00.302 --> 01:06:02.213
Anson.

01:06:03.736 --> 01:06:06.774
Uh, well, could we possibly
then have, um, two first-class-

01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:09.077
eh, second-class tickets
to, to Pontypridd?

01:06:09.169 --> 01:06:10.910
To the north.

01:06:11.002 --> 01:06:13.482
I'm sorry.

01:06:13.569 --> 01:06:17.517
You could've gone yesterday,
but you can't today.

01:06:17.603 --> 01:06:20.209
- Oh?
- Flooding on the line.

01:06:23.202 --> 01:06:25.113
Fl-Flooding.

01:06:36.469 --> 01:06:39.507
Gentlemen, success?

01:06:39.603 --> 01:06:44.518
- Flooding.
- As predicted in the Bible.

01:06:44.603 --> 01:06:47.015
Yes, it's, it's interesting actually,
because the, uh, passenger trains...

01:06:47.102 --> 01:06:50.982
seem to be affected by the flooding, but,
uh, the coal trains are running as normal.

01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:53.208
Oh, different lines.

01:06:53.302 --> 01:06:56.749
Ah! Yes, of course. I knew there'd be
a simple explanation, George.

01:06:56.836 --> 01:07:00.545
- You see, it's different lines that they're on.
- Shut up, Anson.

01:07:02.236 --> 01:07:06.776
Now, please send...

01:07:06.869 --> 01:07:11.249
some more blankets and
a bottle of gin to my room.

01:07:11.336 --> 01:07:13.247
Thank you.

01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:18.481
it started rainin'
Thursday night,

01:07:18.569 --> 01:07:21.846
and it rained
all Friday mornin'.

01:07:21.935 --> 01:07:24.848
And it rained
all Friday afternoon.

01:07:26.669 --> 01:07:29.707
It seemed that the rain
would never stop.

01:07:29.803 --> 01:07:33.717
And for the first time, the Welsh and
the English were united by the fact...

01:07:33.803 --> 01:07:36.306
that there was
nothin' to do but wait.

01:07:40.636 --> 01:07:43.207
But then,
on Sunday mornin',

01:07:43.302 --> 01:07:45.782
two miracles occurred:

01:07:45.869 --> 01:07:48.975
It stopped rainin' and,
miracle of miracles,

01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:52.482
Morgan the Goat
talked to Reverend Jones.

01:07:54.369 --> 01:07:56.349
Ah. Reverend Jones.

01:07:56.436 --> 01:07:58.313
Morgan.

01:07:58.402 --> 01:08:00.211
It stopped rainin'.

01:08:01.502 --> 01:08:03.413
Yes, I'm
quite aware of that.

01:08:03.502 --> 01:08:05.914
There are
no trains today.

01:08:06.002 --> 01:08:10.849
Yes, yes. There are no trains
on the day of the Lord.

01:08:10.935 --> 01:08:13.438
Eh, look, wh-what
I'm sayin' is that, uh,

01:08:13.536 --> 01:08:17.006
today is our last chance
to build the mountain.

01:08:17.102 --> 01:08:19.810
But since it's Sunday,
everyone will be in chapel.

01:08:21.469 --> 01:08:26.282
Chapel will start at 10:30
as usual, Mr. Morgan.

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:30.283
But no one will work on a Sunday
without your blessin'.

01:08:30.368 --> 01:08:35.910
And tomorrow, the English will be on the mornin'
train out, and we'll have missed our chance.

01:08:36.002 --> 01:08:39.415
They have telegrams and tickets
and orders from head office.

01:08:39.502 --> 01:08:41.913
I can't keep them here
any longer.

01:08:42.002 --> 01:08:44.845
It's today or never.

01:08:44.935 --> 01:08:48.781
Chapel will start
at 10:30, Mr. Morgan.

01:08:48.868 --> 01:08:54.113
And it would make the good Lord
very happy if for once you were here!

01:09:11.469 --> 01:09:14.450
- Good morning.
- Yes, it is.

01:09:14.536 --> 01:09:16.447
A beautiful mornin'.

01:09:18.368 --> 01:09:22.317
- They're pretty.
- Mmm. Yes.

01:09:22.402 --> 01:09:24.678
But not as pretty as me.

01:09:24.768 --> 01:09:26.770
Y-You're supposed
to say that.

01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:30.511
Betty!

01:09:33.301 --> 01:09:36.374
Didn't you hear me calling?
I need a clean shirt.

01:09:36.469 --> 01:09:39.211
Don't look at me.

01:09:39.301 --> 01:09:44.216
Well, I-I would lend you one,
but I'm afraid this is the only
clean one I have.

01:10:55.603 --> 01:10:58.174
My text for today
comes from...

01:10:58.269 --> 01:11:02.843
Psalm 99: Verse 9.

01:11:05.302 --> 01:11:08.340
"Exalt the Lord our God,

01:11:10.502 --> 01:11:12.448
and worship...

01:11:12.536 --> 01:11:16.746
at His holy hill."

01:11:20.169 --> 01:11:22.080
First thing tomorrow?

01:11:22.169 --> 01:11:24.376
Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so.

01:11:24.469 --> 01:11:28.645
Uh, George had some, uh, pretty stern
orders from London last night,

01:11:28.735 --> 01:11:31.716
so, um, we're off
on the 8:30 train.

01:11:32.935 --> 01:11:35.040
Whatever his, uh,
state of health.

01:11:35.135 --> 01:11:38.639
He was very drunk last night.

01:11:38.735 --> 01:11:40.715
And the night before.

01:11:40.802 --> 01:11:43.578
"A habit
I picked up in india."

01:11:43.668 --> 01:11:47.047
Yes, I don't think he had
enough to do out there, poor chap.

01:11:47.135 --> 01:11:50.810
Oh, yeah.
You'd go mad here too.

01:11:50.902 --> 01:11:55.715
No, I-- I could live in a place
like this. I've-- I've enjoyed myself.

01:11:56.869 --> 01:11:59.475
You have?

01:12:01.269 --> 01:12:04.614
I see it as a prayer...

01:12:04.668 --> 01:12:08.480
made manifest in soil.

01:12:13.035 --> 01:12:17.484
One day,
our children's children...

01:12:17.568 --> 01:12:21.880
will play where
we are piling earth.

01:12:23.269 --> 01:12:27.581
Elderly people will be able
to see it from the valley...

01:12:27.668 --> 01:12:30.410
and be reminded
of their youth.

01:12:31.969 --> 01:12:35.849
And therefore,
even though it is a Sunday--

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:39.246
but especially because
it is a Sunday--

01:12:39.336 --> 01:12:42.715
you will see me immediately
after this service...

01:12:42.802 --> 01:12:45.305
climbing Ffynnon Garw...

01:12:45.402 --> 01:12:47.712
with God's soil in my hand.

01:12:48.969 --> 01:12:51.643
And I will build
that mound...

01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:54.113
and dedicate it to God.

01:12:55.802 --> 01:12:57.713
I will build that mound...

01:13:03.768 --> 01:13:08.217
in memory of our loved ones
who will...

01:13:08.302 --> 01:13:11.511
not return from war!

01:13:11.602 --> 01:13:14.242
And I will
build that mound...

01:13:14.336 --> 01:13:16.316
as a humble echo...

01:13:16.402 --> 01:13:20.748
of the great mountains...
the Lord has given us.

01:13:20.835 --> 01:13:25.045
And I will build that mound
in celebration of the joy...

01:13:25.135 --> 01:13:28.708
our mountain
has given us!

01:13:28.802 --> 01:13:31.976
And I will build
that mound knowing...

01:13:32.069 --> 01:13:36.313
that the Lord God
is with me.

01:13:36.402 --> 01:13:39.542
"Exalt the Lord our God,

01:13:39.635 --> 01:13:42.707
and worship
at His holy hill."

01:13:44.035 --> 01:13:48.814
Oh. And I expect
to see you all-- Huh?

01:13:48.902 --> 01:13:50.813
UP there!

01:14:04.236 --> 01:14:06.512
- Ah.
- But don't think for one minute...

01:14:06.602 --> 01:14:10.175
that you can sell beer
on the Sabbath.

01:14:18.302 --> 01:14:21.875
Though I must say I don't see what I
could usefully do in a place like this.

01:14:21.902 --> 01:14:23.813
Oh, it's easy for you.

01:14:23.902 --> 01:14:26.405
You can do anything.
You're an educated man.

01:14:26.501 --> 01:14:29.539
Well, I'm not really qualified
to do very much.

01:14:29.635 --> 01:14:31.478
I could teach, I suppose.

01:14:34.602 --> 01:14:37.708
Oh, dear.
Sorry. No, I--

01:14:37.802 --> 01:14:39.713
I was, um--

01:14:39.802 --> 01:14:43.306
I was going to ask you something
personal; it was probably indiscreet.

01:14:43.401 --> 01:14:45.472
I don't mind.

01:14:46.568 --> 01:14:49.014
Well, I just, uh--
You know, I-I-I--

01:14:49.102 --> 01:14:52.572
I know even less about you than I d--
I did about, um,

01:14:52.668 --> 01:14:55.114
M-Miss Elizabeth.

01:14:55.202 --> 01:14:59.116
Miss Elizabeth.
I couldn't keep that up for long.

01:15:01.169 --> 01:15:05.618
Well, there's nothing
very special about me.

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:09.411
I'm the kind of girl you
usually don't notice.

01:15:09.501 --> 01:15:13.916
I scuttle in with a tray of tea,
bow my head and scuttle out.

01:15:14.002 --> 01:15:16.448
- I'd notice.
- No, you wouldn't.

01:15:18.435 --> 01:15:20.346
Not usually.

01:15:25.535 --> 01:15:30.211
So, can I ask you
something personal?

01:15:34.702 --> 01:15:37.410
How come you aren't
in France?

01:15:40.635 --> 01:15:44.276
Well, I-I-I was.
Um, I w-- I was, uh--

01:15:44.368 --> 01:15:47.508
I-I went out with the, uh,
first wave in 1914.

01:15:49.035 --> 01:15:50.946
I was at Verdun.

01:15:52.702 --> 01:15:54.978
I came back like Johnny.

01:15:56.202 --> 01:15:58.204
Oh.

01:15:58.301 --> 01:16:00.212
I'm sorry.

01:16:02.135 --> 01:16:06.880
But you're all right now. You just
need some lookin' after.

01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:15.911
- What on earth?
- All right, boys. I'll see you up there.

01:16:19.335 --> 01:16:21.315
We've got
the miners now too.

01:16:21.401 --> 01:16:23.312
Looks like a carnival.

01:16:24.768 --> 01:16:26.748
I feel terribly
responsible. I--

01:16:26.835 --> 01:16:31.409
I hope your Mr. Garrad's ready. We'll have a
mountain for him to measure before tea time.

01:16:40.602 --> 01:16:42.513
Tea wallah!

01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:47.312
I-I-it's Anson, George.

01:16:49.835 --> 01:16:52.247
Oh, Anson. Morning.

01:16:52.335 --> 01:16:55.475
Um, I-I just thought I might,
uh, pop up the hill.

01:16:55.568 --> 01:16:59.482
It seems the, uh, the villagers have made
a little, tiny alteration to the height.

01:16:59.568 --> 01:17:03.072
I thought I might, uh, measure it.
Nothing much better to do, so--

01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:07.311
Capital. Good for you. You could
probably use the fresh air.

01:17:08.468 --> 01:17:10.379
Well, that's what
I thought. Yeah.

01:17:10.468 --> 01:17:13.005
Umm, y-you don't
want to join me?

01:17:13.102 --> 01:17:15.810
- Where?
- Eh, up the hill.

01:17:15.902 --> 01:17:17.813
Oh, good God, no, no, no.

01:17:17.902 --> 01:17:22.647
I'll stay here if you don't mind. Lots of paperwork.
Scads to catch up on and such.

01:17:22.735 --> 01:17:24.646
Absolutely.

01:17:24.735 --> 01:17:28.581
All right. Say, you don't want me
to open up a window or anything?

01:17:38.301 --> 01:17:43.478
Um, I'm not sure that I
can rely on Mr. Garrad.

01:17:43.568 --> 01:17:46.913
But, um, the thing is, I-I
will need an assistant. I--

01:17:48.702 --> 01:17:51.205
- You wouldn't, um--
- Me?

01:17:51.301 --> 01:17:53.679
Wh-Why not?

01:17:53.768 --> 01:17:57.079
Well... I've never
been to Abyssinia...

01:17:58.268 --> 01:18:01.272
or to Aden...
or Sebastopol,

01:18:01.368 --> 01:18:03.814
and I can't speak
with a posh accent for long.

01:18:03.902 --> 01:18:07.076
Well, I-I-I think
we can get over that.

01:18:07.168 --> 01:18:10.047
I'm just a maidservant.

01:18:10.135 --> 01:18:14.049
Well, I-I don't think the word "just"
could apply to you about anything.

01:18:15.602 --> 01:18:17.775
- Was that a compliment?
- Yes. Yes.

01:18:17.869 --> 01:18:20.748
And n-now I'm going
to blush, so, um,

01:18:20.835 --> 01:18:24.442
w-would you
help me... please?

01:18:24.535 --> 01:18:29.450
- Since you said please,
and you're blushin', yes, I will.
- No!

01:18:29.535 --> 01:18:31.378
Good. Then, uh,

01:18:31.468 --> 01:18:33.812
prepare the engineer's
transit, please.

01:18:33.902 --> 01:18:35.813
- The what?
- I'll show you.

01:19:26.035 --> 01:19:27.946
This is extraordinary.

01:19:28.035 --> 01:19:30.276
When Morgan gets
a bee in his bonnet--

01:19:55.235 --> 01:19:57.340
Let's keep
the hands up.

01:19:57.435 --> 01:19:59.506
You know, I think
they're going to succeed.

01:20:03.101 --> 01:20:05.809
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

01:20:05.902 --> 01:20:07.813
We'll have a mountain
for your map.

01:20:07.902 --> 01:20:11.315
Oh, indeed, I think you will. I--
I just hope you can finish it today.

01:20:11.401 --> 01:20:14.678
We lost a lot in the rain,
but we still have a chance.

01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:18.147
- Well, perhaps you should cover it with turf.
- Turf?

01:20:18.235 --> 01:20:22.183
- He means sod.
- Sod? We'll need good sod.

01:20:22.268 --> 01:20:24.248
A lot of good sod.

01:20:38.535 --> 01:20:40.947
This is an outrage!

01:20:41.034 --> 01:20:43.378
How dare you?

01:20:43.468 --> 01:20:47.041
Have the council been informed?
Does anyone have written permission?

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:50.138
I mean, look at this.
It's madness!

01:20:50.235 --> 01:20:52.738
Stop actin' so English.

01:20:58.935 --> 01:21:01.472
- Go on up there.
- Right, then, boys. Carry on.

01:21:01.568 --> 01:21:04.845
Come uppa!
Come uppa! That's it. That's it.

01:21:18.835 --> 01:21:22.544
Absolutely everyone
climbed Ffynnon Garw that day,

01:21:22.635 --> 01:21:24.546
except Davies the School,
of course,

01:21:24.635 --> 01:21:28.105
and Johnny, who was happy
to help down in the valley,

01:21:28.201 --> 01:21:31.011
but too fearful
to go up Ffynnon Garw again.

01:21:37.435 --> 01:21:39.346
Thank you, Johnny.

01:22:26.968 --> 01:22:28.879
I'll take that.

01:22:40.501 --> 01:22:43.038
There's not much daylight left
for a measurement.

01:22:43.134 --> 01:22:45.114
Well, stop
standing around and help.

01:22:46.735 --> 01:22:48.646
Come on.

01:22:55.869 --> 01:22:58.543
Look, I'm terribly sorry
about the motorcar.

01:22:58.635 --> 01:23:03.209
I covered it with tarpaulin, but
I don't know. The wind, uh, must've--

01:23:03.301 --> 01:23:06.009
W-Would that be this tarpaulin
by any chance?

01:23:07.468 --> 01:23:10.779
- Yes.
- That's all right, Mr. Williams.

01:23:10.868 --> 01:23:13.576
I wouldn't have missed this
for the world.

01:23:30.934 --> 01:23:34.609
It's Johnny.
It's Johnny!

01:23:52.301 --> 01:23:54.212
It was touch and go
to finish...

01:23:54.301 --> 01:23:57.373
while there was still light
for Mr. Anson to measure.

01:23:57.468 --> 01:24:00.312
And there are many who
still say we would've succeeded,

01:24:00.401 --> 01:24:02.711
but fate had one more trick
up her sleeve.

01:24:15.134 --> 01:24:17.045
Reverend Jones!

01:24:21.235 --> 01:24:23.215
Later,
when we all talked,

01:24:23.301 --> 01:24:29.217
we realized that Reverend Jones had climbed
Ffynnon Garw five or six times that day,

01:24:29.301 --> 01:24:31.941
enough to make
a young, fit man stiff,

01:24:32.034 --> 01:24:36.483
and definitely too much
for a man of 82.

01:24:36.568 --> 01:24:39.572
Yes. We didn't
know that either,

01:24:39.668 --> 01:24:42.672
but Reverend Jones was 82.

01:24:42.768 --> 01:24:46.409
And we thought
he was just in his 60s.

01:24:48.034 --> 01:24:49.945
Morgan!

01:24:50.034 --> 01:24:52.412
- Morgan the Goat!
- Morgan. Morgan.

01:24:56.068 --> 01:24:58.105
- He wants me?
- Yes.

01:25:14.068 --> 01:25:15.979
Come closer.

01:25:16.068 --> 01:25:17.979
Take my hand now.

01:25:21.834 --> 01:25:26.408
I know I can count on you.

01:25:27.801 --> 01:25:30.441
What's he saying?
What's he saying?

01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:37.305
What's he saying?

01:25:37.401 --> 01:25:39.312
Get Jones the J.P.!

01:25:44.001 --> 01:25:46.038
The sergeant
verified death,

01:25:46.134 --> 01:25:49.240
but Jones the J.P. would have
to consecrate the ground...

01:25:49.335 --> 01:25:53.374
before the Reverend Jones
could have his dyin' wish.

01:25:53.468 --> 01:25:57.507
This plot of earth
at the summit of Ffynnon Garw...

01:25:57.602 --> 01:26:01.106
is duly consecrated to receive
the mortal remains...

01:26:01.201 --> 01:26:04.978
of our dear friend
and spiritual leader,

01:26:05.068 --> 01:26:07.674
the Reverend Robert Jones.

01:26:07.767 --> 01:26:13.308
â™ªâ™ª

01:26:54.101 --> 01:26:56.877
So you'll be takin' the first train
out in the morning?

01:26:56.968 --> 01:26:59.972
Yes. Yes, I'm
afraid we will.

01:27:00.068 --> 01:27:02.275
Fair is fair.

01:27:02.368 --> 01:27:06.316
We had a damn good fight, didn't we?
If it wasn't for the reverend--

01:27:06.401 --> 01:27:09.314
If it wasn't for the reverend, it wouldn't
have been built in the first place.

01:27:09.401 --> 01:27:11.312
- Aye. True.
- True enough.

01:27:22.101 --> 01:27:24.012
Come on.

01:27:27.034 --> 01:27:29.378
Well-- I-it will be measured again.
I mean, eh--

01:27:29.468 --> 01:27:32.244
Perhaps we'll even come back
through here on our return, and--

01:27:32.335 --> 01:27:34.747
You won't be back.

01:27:34.834 --> 01:27:37.542
This isn't a place that people
like you come back to.

01:27:37.634 --> 01:27:40.410
Well, I'll try.
I'll really try.

01:27:40.501 --> 01:27:44.972
"I'll try" ?
Is that the best you can do?

01:27:45.068 --> 01:27:47.981
After all they've done.

01:27:48.068 --> 01:27:51.208
All this work.

01:27:51.301 --> 01:27:54.748
How would you like them to say
it failed because of you?

01:27:54.834 --> 01:27:58.111
But what am I supposed to do?
Measure it in the dark?

01:27:58.201 --> 01:28:00.738
Wait up here 'til the first light
of dawn, and th-then race down--

01:28:00.834 --> 01:28:03.212
The sun's up at 5:00.

01:28:03.301 --> 01:28:05.372
That's only a few hours away.

01:28:10.134 --> 01:28:12.045
I'd keep you company.

01:28:18.134 --> 01:28:20.774
W-Well, I-if it is
that late, and, uh,

01:28:20.868 --> 01:28:23.405
a-and the sun will
be up soon, I, uh--

01:28:23.501 --> 01:28:26.482
I mean, I may as well stay here
and, uh, wait for dawn.

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:30.379
Uh, after all,
we've come this far.

01:28:30.468 --> 01:28:32.948
Good night.

01:29:18.534 --> 01:29:20.445
Drink, Blod?

01:29:21.901 --> 01:29:23.812
Good night, Morgan.

01:29:41.634 --> 01:29:45.844
They're in chapel. It's Sunday.
What's yours?

01:30:09.401 --> 01:30:14.043
And so it was that Betty and
Anson stayed a night on Ffynnon Garw.

01:30:14.134 --> 01:30:16.580
Now you know what the Welsh
say about people...

01:30:16.667 --> 01:30:19.113
who stay on mountain peaks
at night, don't you?

01:30:19.201 --> 01:30:24.776
They become poets, madmen,
very, very wise, or--

01:30:42.901 --> 01:30:45.814
â™ªâ™ª

01:30:59.368 --> 01:31:01.746
And when they descended,
it was to announce...

01:31:01.834 --> 01:31:07.716
that Ffynnon Garw was indeed
a mountain- of 1,002 feet--

01:31:07.801 --> 01:31:11.442
and that they were
engaged to be married.

01:31:11.534 --> 01:31:14.037
Yes, it was
an odd courtship,

01:31:14.134 --> 01:31:17.274
but one befitting a man
who went up a hill...

01:31:17.368 --> 01:31:19.507
but came down a mountain.

01:32:04.934 --> 01:32:08.143
And should you think
this is just a shaggy-dog story...

01:32:08.235 --> 01:32:12.706
told by a senile man to his
young, impressionable grandson,

01:32:12.801 --> 01:32:15.042
I'd ask you to come
to South Wales,

01:32:15.134 --> 01:32:17.273
to the village
where I was born.

01:32:17.367 --> 01:32:19.677
And as you drive north
from Cardiff,

01:32:19.767 --> 01:32:22.008
look for
the first big hill--

01:32:22.101 --> 01:32:24.377
not just a hill,
but a mountain--

01:32:24.467 --> 01:32:27.914
and the children
of the people who built it.

01:32:37.734 --> 01:32:42.649
However, just before this film was made,
the mountain was remeasured...

01:32:42.734 --> 01:32:46.876
and found to be 997 feet.

01:32:46.968 --> 01:32:50.541
Thus the mound
had settled back into a hill.

01:32:51.901 --> 01:32:53.938
A hill?
