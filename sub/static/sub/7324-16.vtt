08:13.864 --> 08:15.165
(indistinct conversations)

08:15.165 --> 08:16.967
(gasping)

08:16.967 --> 08:18.268
OUT OF THE WAY, GREY.
I NEED TO GET IN THERE.

08:18.268 --> 08:20.631
WE'VE GOT A WHITE OUT ON
THE RIGHT. YANG, CHEST TUBE.

08:20.631 --> 08:22.102
SURE.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.934
(labored breathing)

08:23.934 --> 08:25.636
ROUGH NIGHT LAST NIGHT?

08:25.636 --> 08:26.807
HMM?

08:26.807 --> 08:27.978
YOU DIDN'T COME HOME.

08:27.978 --> 08:29.109
OH, YEAH. UH, M.V.C.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.782
I TEXTED, BUT, UH,
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN ASLEEP.

08:31.782 --> 08:33.283
(Meredith) OKAY, DEVIN,
WE ARE GONNA

08:33.283 --> 08:34.815
GIVE YOU SOME PAIN MEDS.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.787
AND WE'RE GONNA PUT
A TUBE IN YOUR CHEST

08:36.787 --> 08:37.948
THAT WILL DRAIN THE BLOOD,

08:37.948 --> 08:39.920
AND YOU WILL START
TO FEEL A LOT BETTER.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.151
I JUST RAN INTO TEDDY.

08:41.151 --> 08:42.993
SHE SAID THAT SHE BLEW HER PITCH
TO THE BOARD THIS MORNING.

08:42.993 --> 08:45.025
IT MIGHT BE NICE IF YOU
BACKED HER UP, YOU KNOW?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.897
PUT IN A GOOD WORD.

08:46.897 --> 08:48.699
PULSE IS FAINT ON THE LEFT.
I NEED A C.T. ANGIO.

08:48.699 --> 08:49.860
OKAY, DEVIN, ONCE WE GET
THIS TUBE IN,

08:49.860 --> 08:51.031
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU
TO C.T.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.132
DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY
WE NEED TO CONTACT?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.004
HI, THIS IS DR. GREY.
I NEED A C.T. ANGIO.

08:54.004 --> 08:55.305
MY PARENTS ARE OLD.
I DON'T WANT TO WORRY THEM.

08:55.305 --> 08:58.138
IF YOU COULD JUST
LET ANGIE KNOW I'M OKAY.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.109
SHE'S PROBABLY WORRIED.

08:59.109 --> 09:00.270
I'M SORRY. WHO'S ANGIE?

09:00.270 --> 09:01.742
UH, THE BURNED BARISTA
IN TRAUMA ONE.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.644
DR. GREY, DR. WEBBER'S
IN THE E.R.

09:03.644 --> 09:04.745
YEAH?

09:04.745 --> 09:05.876
NO, HE'S IN THE E.R.

09:05.876 --> 09:08.118
(people speaking indistinctly)

09:08.118 --> 09:10.651
(labored breathing continues)

09:10.651 --> 09:12.282
I-I CHECKED
THE OVER PRESSURE VALVE.

09:12.282 --> 09:13.984
I-IT WAS FINE.

09:13.984 --> 09:16.056
OR WAS THAT YESTERDAY?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.258
OH, GOD, IS THIS MY FAULT?
DID I MELT MY OWN FACE OFF?

09:18.258 --> 09:21.161
NOTHING'S BEEN MELTED OFF.
TRY TO STAY STILL, PLEASE.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.663
I MEAN, THEY CAN'T EXPECT ME
TO MONITOR THE MACHINE

09:22.663 --> 09:24.064
AND HANDLE THE MORNING RUSH,
RIGHT?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.265
I REALLY NEED YOU
TO STAY STILL.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.097
I MEAN, IT'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE,
THIS JOB.

09:27.097 --> 09:28.999
NOT ENOUGH PAY
AND WAY TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.240
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
HAVE NO IDEA.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.202
WE'RE FIXING YOUR FACE.
THAT IS PRESSURE.

09:32.202 --> 09:33.804
NOW IF YOU COULD
DO US BOTH A FAVOR AND--

09:33.804 --> 09:35.976
DR. AVERY, GO GET US
SOME MORE BANDAGES.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.047
NOW.

09:37.047 --> 09:40.050
(panting)

09:40.050 --> 09:42.813
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

09:42.813 --> 09:44.114
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

09:44.114 --> 09:47.157
CONTINUE TO CLEAN HERE.
I'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND.

09:47.157 --> 09:48.118
(man) OKAY, DOCTOR.

09:48.118 --> 09:50.991
YOU YELLED AT A PATIENT
AND A PARAMEDIC,

09:50.991 --> 09:52.993
TWO PEOPLE YOU DO NOT
WANT TO PISS OFF.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.294
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

09:54.294 --> 09:55.966
I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?

09:55.966 --> 09:57.127
I'VE JUST BEEN SO TENSE.
I'M STUDYING FOR THE BOARDS.

09:57.127 --> 09:59.770
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING.
YOU'LL DO FINE.

09:59.770 --> 10:01.702
I CAN'T DO FINE. I HAVE TO
DO GREAT. I'M AN AVERY.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.974
ARE YOU GETTING ANY?

10:03.974 --> 10:05.135
(elevator bell dings)
DID YOU JUST ASK ME
IF I'M GETTING ANY?

10:05.135 --> 10:07.207
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME?
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.879
JUST TELL ME.
I WON'T JUDGE.

10:08.879 --> 10:10.841
I AM FOCUSED.
THERE'S NO TIME.

10:10.841 --> 10:14.144
THERE'S ALWAYS TIME.

10:14.144 --> 10:16.246
MY MOTHER USED TO HAVE TROUBLE
WITH THE STOVE, TOO,

10:16.246 --> 10:18.719
AND THEN SHE STARTED
GETTING LOST DRIVING,

10:18.719 --> 10:20.090
AND THEN SHE STARTED
LEAVING THE HOUSE

10:20.090 --> 10:21.822
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.123
ADELE'S FINE.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.254
AND WE'RE--
WE'RE MANAGING.

10:24.254 --> 10:26.927
ROSE RIDGE IS TOP-NOTCH--

10:26.927 --> 10:29.199
GREAT DOCTORS,
GREAT FACILITY.

10:29.199 --> 10:32.132
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
WE'RE JUST NOT THERE YET.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.633
ANY DEEPER,

10:33.633 --> 10:36.136
AND THIS BURN COULD'VE
RETIRED YOU FROM SURGERY.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.267
YEAH, I'LL--
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

10:37.267 --> 10:38.809
YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO SHUT ME UP.

10:38.809 --> 10:40.010
YEAH, HOW AM I DOING?

10:40.010 --> 10:41.712
I DON'T HAVE PULL
MANY PLACES,

10:41.712 --> 10:43.243
BUT I'M KIND OF
A BIG DEAL THERE.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.075
SO IF YOU NEED ME TO MAKE
A CALL FOR YOU, I CAN.

10:49.079 --> 10:51.081
(Arizona) GOOD. ONLY A LITTLE
OF THE BOWEL IS NECROTIC.

10:51.081 --> 10:52.652
THERE SHOULD BE
MORE THAN ENOUGH TO SALVAGE.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.424
(Lexie) MAYBE HIS DAD SHOULD
FACTOR SPUNK

10:54.424 --> 10:56.156
INTO HIS STUPID ALGORITHM.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.428
HE'S A FOURTH YEAR. HE KNOWS
JUST ENOUGH TO BE ANNOYING.

10:58.428 --> 11:00.991
WELL, HE'S ACTING LIKE
THE BABY IS ALREADY DEAD.

11:00.991 --> 11:02.993
BUT LOOK AT HIM.
HE'S A CHAMP.

11:02.993 --> 11:05.235
YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE
MUHAMMAD ALI, AREN'T YOU?

11:05.235 --> 11:06.767
SOMEONE'S PEPPY.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.139
SHE'S ON A VACATION FROM
LOST-CAUSE BRAIN SURGERIES.

11:09.139 --> 11:10.971
SHE NEEDS TO HAVE
SOME FUN TODAY.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.102
YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY FUN?

11:12.102 --> 11:13.904
REMOVING DEAD BOWEL.
YOU WANT TO MAKE THE CUT?

11:13.904 --> 11:16.376
REALLY? ARE--ARE--
ARE YOU SURE?

11:16.376 --> 11:19.679
YEAH. GET OVER THERE
BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.082
(people speaking indistinctly)

11:22.082 --> 11:24.084
OKAY, THE TISSUE RIPS
REALLY EASILY,

11:24.084 --> 11:26.386
SO ONLY PRESS DOWN AS HARD
AS YOU WOULD NEED TO CUT A HAIR.

11:26.386 --> 11:30.460
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:30.460 --> 11:32.122
SO TORRES AND I ASSESSED
HIS SHOULDER,

11:32.122 --> 11:33.463
AND I MEAN, WOW.

11:33.463 --> 11:35.766
SO WE BOTH AGREED--

11:35.766 --> 11:37.297
YEAH, LET'S JUST DO THIS.
UH, SIR.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.169
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A SCAN
OF YOUR CHEST AND YOUR ARMS.
HERE YOU GO.

11:39.169 --> 11:41.301
SO JUST TRY AND RELAX.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.133
MY FRIEND ANGIE,
IS SH--IS SHE OKAY?

11:43.133 --> 11:45.806
SHE'S GOT SOME BAD BURNS,
BUT SHE'LL BE FINE.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.308
IT'S MY FAULT FOR GOING IN
DURING THE RUSH.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.980
SHE GETS TOO FLUSTERED
AROUND ME.

11:49.980 --> 11:52.282
AND THE SEXUAL TENSION'S
BEEN BUILDING FOR MONTHS--

11:52.282 --> 11:54.314
YOU KNOW, A LOOK HERE,
A SMILE THERE.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.116
IT CAN BE HARD TO FOCUS

11:56.116 --> 11:59.189
WITH ALL THOSE PHEROMONES
BUZZING AROUND YOU.

11:59.189 --> 12:01.021
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
IT'S BECOME DANGEROUS.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.192
OKAY, WELL, LET'S GET YOU
AND YOUR PHEROMONES

12:02.192 --> 12:03.323
INTO THE SCAN.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.126
YEAH, LATELY, SHE'S BEEN
TAKING IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL,

12:06.126 --> 12:09.199
ADDING THESE FOAM LEAF DESIGNS
ON TOP OF MY COFFEE...

12:09.199 --> 12:11.261
MM-HMM.
HANDMADE, JUST FOR ME.

12:11.261 --> 12:13.233
IT'D BE GREAT
IF I COULD SEND ANGIE

12:13.233 --> 12:14.965
A CAPPUCCINO OR SOMETHING.

12:14.965 --> 12:18.038
LET HER KNOW
I'M DOING OKAY.

12:19.169 --> 12:21.241
(switch clicks, scanner whirs)

12:21.241 --> 12:23.974
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

12:23.974 --> 12:25.315
NICELY DONE.

12:25.315 --> 12:26.947
(exhales)

12:26.947 --> 12:28.949
SO NOW WHAT?

12:28.949 --> 12:30.280
EVEN IF HE STABILIZES,

12:30.280 --> 12:32.222
HE'S LOOKING AT YEARS OF
PROCEDURES AND SURGERIES.

12:32.222 --> 12:33.884
HIS PARENTS ARE RESIDENTS.

12:33.884 --> 12:35.425
THEY CAN'T BOTH QUIT,
AND MEDICAL CARE

12:35.425 --> 12:37.287
FOR A LITTLE GUY LIKE THIS
IS EXPENSIVE.

12:37.287 --> 12:38.358
YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO TAKE
THE FUN OUT OF A PARTY,

12:38.358 --> 12:39.529
YOU KNOW THAT?

12:39.529 --> 12:41.231
(monitor beeping erratically)

12:41.231 --> 12:42.462
(Arizona) DAMN. LOOKS LIKE
HE'S IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.834
PUSH EPI AND ATROPINE.

12:43.834 --> 12:45.295
(beeping continues)
D-DID I--

12:45.295 --> 12:47.237
NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU DID
JUST FINE. IT'S JUST THAT--

12:47.237 --> 12:48.368
(beeping increases)

12:48.368 --> 12:50.270
HE'S BRADIED DOWN TO 52.
GREY, START C.P.R.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.972
HIS HEART HASN'T STOPPED.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.143
WITH PREEMIES,
WE START C.P.R.

12:53.143 --> 12:54.344
WHEN THE HEART RATE
GOES BELOW 60.

12:54.344 --> 12:56.146
NOW USE TWO FINGERS,
LIGHT PRESSURE. GO.

12:56.146 --> 13:00.010
(beeping continues)

13:03.814 --> 13:06.456
WE GET SEVEN MAJOR NEWSPAPERS
HERE EVERY DAY,

13:06.456 --> 13:09.389
AS WELL AS LIVE READINGS
FROM LOCAL AUTHORS.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.221
OH, LOOK, ADELE,
A MYSTERY SECTION.
(chuckles)

13:11.221 --> 13:13.363
SHE LOVES MYSTERIES,
DON'T YOU, HONEY?

13:13.363 --> 13:15.826
OUR LIBRARIAN READS A CHAPTER
EVERY DAY AFTER DINNER.

13:15.826 --> 13:18.268
ACTUALLY, WE'RE JUST FINISHING
"DEATH ON THE NILE,"

13:18.268 --> 13:20.030
SO IF YOU KNOW WHO DONE IT,
KEEP IT TO YOURSELVES.

13:20.030 --> 13:21.401
(laughs)

13:21.401 --> 13:22.833
(people speaking indistinctly)

13:22.833 --> 13:24.174
SHOULD WE CHECK OUT
THE GYMNASIUM?

13:24.174 --> 13:26.506
WE JUST ADDED
A PILOXING CLASS.

13:26.506 --> 13:30.280
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

13:38.248 --> 13:39.589
EVERY ROOM IS DIFFERENT,

13:39.589 --> 13:41.121
BUT THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN
INSTANT CALL BUTTON

13:41.121 --> 13:42.252
FOR ATTENDANTS,

13:42.252 --> 13:44.955
YOUR OWN BATHROOM,
AND A NICE VIEW OF THE GROUNDS.

13:44.955 --> 13:46.296
I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE

13:46.296 --> 13:47.597
SO YOU CAN LOOK THE PLACE OVER
ON YOUR OWN.

13:47.597 --> 13:50.160
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
I'LL BE AT THE FRONT DESK.

14:01.311 --> 14:03.143
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
ADELE?

14:03.143 --> 14:06.176
IT'S NICE.

14:06.176 --> 14:07.477
BUT IT'S TOO SMALL
FOR US.

14:07.477 --> 14:09.519
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

14:09.519 --> 14:12.022
YOU SAID THAT
YOU COULD AFFORD A HOUSE.

14:12.022 --> 14:15.325
WE CERTAINLY COULDN'T
POSSIBLY START A FAMILY HERE.

14:15.325 --> 14:17.227
RICHARD...

14:17.227 --> 14:20.430
WHERE WOULD THE NURSERY GO?

14:25.095 --> 14:27.337
YOU'RE RIGHT, HONEY.

14:27.337 --> 14:29.069
IT'S TOO SMALL.

14:30.470 --> 14:34.104
I SAID I'D GET YOU A HOUSE.

14:34.104 --> 14:35.405
LET'S GO.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.516
I GOT IT.

14:46.516 --> 14:48.358
GOT WHAT?
THE GRANT.

14:48.358 --> 14:49.519
(gasps)

14:49.519 --> 14:51.591
$4 MILLION TO GROW HEARTS
FROM STEM CELLS.

14:51.591 --> 14:52.993
YOU GOT IT?

14:52.993 --> 14:55.265
I'M GONNA GROW HEARTS.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

14:55.265 --> 14:56.666
(laughs) OH, GOD, TEDDY,
THAT'S AMAZING.

14:56.666 --> 14:59.569
I-I MUST HAVE NOT DONE AS BAD
AS I THOUGHT THIS MORNING

14:59.569 --> 15:02.072
UNLESS--OR I CHARMED THEM WITH
MY FUMBLING DESPERATION.

15:02.072 --> 15:04.504
I-I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DON'T CARE. I GOT IT.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.938
WE WERE ABLE TO CUT OUT
MOST OF THE NECROTIC BOWEL,

15:07.938 --> 15:09.579
BUT THEN HE WENT INTO C.H.F.

15:09.579 --> 15:10.540
(sighs)

15:10.540 --> 15:12.082
OH, MY GOD.

15:12.082 --> 15:14.544
MORGAN, HE'S 24 WEEKS OLD.

15:14.544 --> 15:16.286
BORN 16 WEEKS EARLY.

15:16.286 --> 15:18.088
THIS SHOULDN'T BE A SHOCK.
HE WASN'T READY.

15:18.088 --> 15:20.090
BUT THERE ARE A FEW THINGS
THAT WE CAN TRY

15:20.090 --> 15:21.651
TO HELP OXYGENATE HIM BETTER.

15:21.651 --> 15:23.353
AND THEN HOPEFULLY,
HE'LL GET STRONGER.

15:23.353 --> 15:24.654
WE COULD USE
LIQUID VENTILATION.

15:24.654 --> 15:26.926
WHICH COULD CAUSE HYPOCARBIA.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.229
WE COULD PUT HIM ON
A HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATOR.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.560
WHICH COULD CAUSE
AIR TRAPPING.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.202
OR WE CAN PUT HIM ON ECMO.

15:32.202 --> 15:34.064
WHICH, UH, JUST TO GET
AHEAD OF YOU, CHRIS,

15:34.064 --> 15:35.605
WE DON'T THINK HE WOULD
SURVIVE AT THIS STAGE.

15:35.605 --> 15:38.138
(Arizona) OKAY,
BUT BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING,

15:38.138 --> 15:40.040
WE JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW
AGGRESSIVE YOU WANT TO BE.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.672
I THINK WE STOP.
WE STOP RIGHT NOW.

15:44.644 --> 15:45.615
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

15:45.615 --> 15:48.478
THERE ARE--
ARE PLENTY OF OPTIONS. WE...

15:48.478 --> 15:50.380
WE SHOULD USE THEM.

15:50.380 --> 15:53.423
THESE ARE HIS CHANCES
OF SURVIVAL RIGHT HERE.

15:53.423 --> 15:54.584
THIS IS REALITY.

15:54.584 --> 15:56.286
NOW YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
THINK LIKE ONE.

15:56.286 --> 15:57.587
IF YOU HAD A PATIENT
WITH ODDS LIKE THAT,

15:57.587 --> 16:00.460
WOULD YOU OPERATE?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.662
(beeping continues)

16:02.662 --> 16:05.265
I'M SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.
THE WAY I--

16:05.265 --> 16:07.697
MY BEHAVIOR WAS
COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL.

IS HONOR HER IN SICKNESS

23:32.712 --> 23:35.485

MEANS THROWING THINGS,

23:38.588 --> 23:40.550

AS ADVANCED.

I JUST--I DON'T WANT HER

23:57.707 --> 23:59.909

23:59.909 --> 24:02.612

24:02.612 --> 24:05.174
HAVE THE SAME, UH,

SAME... ROOTS.

24:08.017 --> 24:09.649

24:10.820 --> 24:14.584
(suction gurgling)

24:14.584 --> 24:17.827
OKAY, LET'S JUST
RESECT THE TUMOR.

24:20.690 --> 24:22.031

ISN'T THE ANSWER.

24:22.031 --> 24:23.563
THEN LIQUID VENTILATION.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.565

IT'S NOT ABOUT GIVING UP.

24:31.501 --> 24:32.672
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.504
IT'S ABOUT DOING MORE HARM
THAN GOOD.

24:34.504 --> 24:37.246
HOW IS LETTING HIM DIE
GOOD, CHRIS, HOW?

24:37.246 --> 24:38.748
I KNOW YOU.

24:38.748 --> 24:41.751
DEEP DOWN, WE'RE BOTH THINKING
THE EXACT SAME THING.

24:41.751 --> 24:44.754
TELL ME WHAT WE'RE THINKING,
CHRIS.

24:44.754 --> 24:46.485
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:46.485 --> 24:49.158
WE'RE THINKING THAT GETTING
PREGNANT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

24:49.158 --> 24:50.890
THAT THIS BABY

24:50.890 --> 24:52.622
SHOULD NOT BE ALIVE
RIGHT NOW,

24:52.622 --> 24:54.263
THAT ITS CHANCES OF SURVIVAL

24:54.263 --> 24:56.996
OR HAVING ANY KIND OF LIFE
WORTH LIVING ARE SLIM TO NONE,

24:56.996 --> 24:59.228
THAT DOING EVERY DAMN THING
WE CAN TO KEEP IT ALIVE

24:59.228 --> 25:01.230
IS JUST SO THAT WE CAN FEEL GOOD
ABOUT OURSELVES AFTER HE DIES.

25:01.230 --> 25:03.272
NOW CAN YOU ADMIT
ANY OF THAT?

25:03.272 --> 25:06.275
(beeping continues)

25:09.979 --> 25:11.140
JUST GO.

25:11.140 --> 25:13.983
YOU CAN'T CUT ME OUT
OF THESE DECISIONS.

25:13.983 --> 25:15.785
I'M NOT CUTTING YOU OUT.

25:15.785 --> 25:18.117
I'M OFFERING YOU AN OUT.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.819
(beeping continues)

25:19.819 --> 25:22.151
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

25:22.151 --> 25:24.854
I'M SAYING,
TAKE THE OUT, CHRIS,

25:24.854 --> 25:27.627
BECAUSE MAYBE
YOU CAN'T ADMIT IT NOW

25:27.627 --> 25:29.198
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY,

25:29.198 --> 25:31.861
BUT YOU WANT IT.

25:31.861 --> 25:34.864

25:37.667 --> 25:39.308

25:40.970 --> 25:42.672

ON YOUR END, TORRES?

25:42.672 --> 25:44.173
HOW ARE WE DOING, GREY?

25:44.173 --> 25:45.715
UH, GOOD.

25:45.715 --> 25:47.216
I'M JUST FINISHING UP
THIS ARTERIAL REPAIR,

25:47.216 --> 25:49.178
AND THEN I'M GONNA
PUT IN THE ROD.

25:49.178 --> 25:51.881
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THE GIRL HE
LOVES HAS NO IDEA HE EXISTS.

25:51.881 --> 25:54.283
NOW THE T.S.A. IS GONNA HASSLE
HIM FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

25:54.283 --> 25:56.255

DOESN'T KNOW WHO HE IS?

25:56.255 --> 25:58.588

26:09.568 --> 26:11.741

26:17.146 --> 26:18.708

26:18.708 --> 26:19.979

GIVE HER A CALL--

26:19.979 --> 26:23.813
IF I WANTED YOUR ADVICE
ON MY SPECIALTY, DR. HUNT,

26:23.813 --> 26:24.984
I'LL ASK.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.919
ONCE TEDDY'S DONE WITH THE LUNG,
YOU CAN GET AT THE OTHER ARM

26:29.919 --> 26:31.621

THE REMAINING SHRAPNEL.

26:31.621 --> 26:33.262
(Owen) ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

26:33.262 --> 26:35.625

26:35.625 --> 26:37.627

26:37.627 --> 26:39.699

NO, NO, IT'D BE EASIER--

26:39.699 --> 26:42.702

27:01.851 --> 27:03.823
YOU AND AVERY SPEND A LOT

27:03.823 --> 27:04.994
WE DO, YES.

27:04.994 --> 27:06.325
UH, BUT WE'RE JUST

27:06.325 --> 27:07.827

27:10.760 --> 27:12.261
HYPNOTIC EYES, ETCETERA.

27:12.261 --> 27:13.733

27:13.733 --> 27:15.104

HE'S BEEN LATELY?

27:15.104 --> 27:17.636
UH, L-LIKE I SAID, WE'RE
STUDY BUDDIES, SO... (chuckles)

27:17.636 --> 27:19.638

27:19.638 --> 27:22.742

27:22.742 --> 27:25.915
MAYBE EXTEND
THAT BUDDY RELATIONSHIP.

27:25.915 --> 27:28.748
EXTEND? UM...
I-I DON'T--

27:28.748 --> 27:30.379
YOU'RE TWO ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE.

27:30.379 --> 27:33.422
ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW TO
ALLEVIATE THAT STRESS?

27:33.422 --> 27:36.686
WE COULD--WE COULD GO
FOR MORE WALKS?

27:36.686 --> 27:37.927
WALKS ARE GOOD.

27:37.927 --> 27:39.228
WALKS ARE NICE.

27:39.228 --> 27:42.732
I WAS THINKING, SINCE YOU'RE
ALREADY STUDY BUDDIES,

27:42.732 --> 27:45.064
YOU COULD EXTEND
THAT RELATIONSHIP...

27:45.064 --> 27:46.766
(elevator bell dings)

27:46.766 --> 27:49.699
BECOME THE OTHER KIND
OF BUDDIES.

27:49.699 --> 27:50.940

27:50.940 --> 27:52.101

27:53.873 --> 27:55.344
EVERYBODY WINS.

27:55.344 --> 27:57.847
TH-THIS IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

27:57.847 --> 27:59.709
I THINK OF IT
AS SEXUAL ENCOURAGEMENT.

27:59.709 --> 28:01.280
OH!

28:01.280 --> 28:02.411
THINK ABOUT IT, KEPNER.

28:02.411 --> 28:05.014
TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM.

28:05.014 --> 28:06.716

28:06.716 --> 28:08.057
YOU GOT HER
THE GRANT MONEY.

28:08.057 --> 28:09.719
LOOK, I KNOW YOU DID.
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER.

28:09.719 --> 28:11.220
IT'LL HELP THINGS
BETWEEN YOU GUYS.

28:11.220 --> 28:13.062
NO, IT WON'T.
ALL RIGHT, THEN I'LL TELL HER.

28:13.062 --> 28:14.463
NO, YOU WON'T.

28:14.463 --> 28:15.995
YOU CAN'T LET HER
TREAT YOU THIS WAY.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.696
WHEN HENRY DIED,

28:17.696 --> 28:19.198
YOU WERE JUST DOING YOUR JOB.
YOU'RE NOT A BAD GUY.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.930
(people speaking indistinctly)

28:20.930 --> 28:23.132
(huffs)
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

28:23.132 --> 28:25.034
LOOK... (sighs)

28:25.034 --> 28:26.205
SOMETIMES,
YOU JUST LASH OUT.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.706
IT MIGHT NOT
BE RATIONAL OR FAIR,

28:27.706 --> 28:29.779
BUT YOU DO IT
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO.

28:29.779 --> 28:31.781
IF SHE NEEDS ME FOR THAT,
IF SHE NEEDS A PUNCHING BAG,

28:31.781 --> 28:33.012
A BAD GUY
TO POINT THE FINGER AT

28:33.012 --> 28:34.483
AND HELP HER COPE,

28:34.483 --> 28:35.915
THEN LET THAT BE ME.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.246
FINE, YOU CAN BE A MARTYR,

28:37.246 --> 28:38.788
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO BE
THE CHIEF.

28:38.788 --> 28:40.249
AND WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT O.R. TODAY,

28:40.249 --> 28:42.752
THAT SHOULD
NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

28:42.752 --> 28:44.453
(people continue

28:44.453 --> 28:46.355

28:50.900 --> 28:53.302
WE WERE ABLE TO REPAIR YOUR LUNG
AND FIX YOUR SHOULDER,

28:53.302 --> 28:55.004
BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED
MONTHS OF REHAB.

28:55.004 --> 28:56.405
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

28:56.405 --> 28:57.736
LIKE I GOT HIT
BY A DUMP TRUCK.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.269
YEAH, IT'S GONNA FEEL
LIKE THAT FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

29:00.269 --> 29:02.741
BUT DON'T BE AFRAID
TO USE, UH,

29:02.741 --> 29:05.244

FOR, UH, PAIN MEDS.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.516

COME BY THE ROOM?

29:07.516 --> 29:08.918
(people speaking indistinctly)

29:08.918 --> 29:10.479

29:10.479 --> 29:13.923

29:13.923 --> 29:16.185
ANGIE HAS NO IDEA
WHO YOU ARE.

29:16.185 --> 29:18.087
WHAT?

29:18.087 --> 29:19.789

29:19.789 --> 29:22.461
SHE...
SHE KNOWS MY ORDER.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.433
I DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO SAY IT.

29:24.433 --> 29:26.035
THAT'S HER JOB.

29:26.035 --> 29:28.037
THE ACCIDENT...

29:28.037 --> 29:29.768
SHE'S CONFUSED.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.801
SHE KNOWS ME.

29:31.801 --> 29:33.242
WE HAVE THIS THING,

29:33.242 --> 29:35.774
THIS FLIRTATION.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.909

29:39.909 --> 29:42.381

EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAID.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.954
THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY IDEA

29:44.954 --> 29:46.485
WHO YOU ARE.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.557
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT SHE SAID.

29:48.557 --> 29:51.160
YOU'VE MADE UP THIS WHOLE THING
IN YOUR HEAD.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.962
NO. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:52.962 --> 29:54.894
I DO.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.025
IT HAPPENS.

29:56.025 --> 29:57.366
I MEAN, YOU SEE ONE THING

29:57.366 --> 29:58.998
AND YOU THINK IT MEANS
SOMETHING THAT IT DOESN'T,

29:58.998 --> 30:02.201
AND PRETTY SOON,
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE IT'S REAL.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.473
YOU HAVE TO STOP.

30:04.473 --> 30:06.805
YOU HAVE TO JUST...

30:06.805 --> 30:08.908
STOP.

30:08.908 --> 30:11.510
(beeping continues)

30:11.510 --> 30:14.143

HIS CARDIOVASCULAR

RIGHT?

30:15.584 --> 30:17.246

30:17.246 --> 30:18.888
WHEN WILL WE KNOW
IF IT'S WORKING?

30:18.888 --> 30:19.889
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

30:19.889 --> 30:21.220
BUT YOU SHOULD GO REST.
WE'LL UPDATE YOU.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.952
CHRIS LEFT.
I'M ALL HE HAS NOW.

30:22.952 --> 30:24.854
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

30:24.854 --> 30:26.595
WELL, IT'S BETTER
IF YOU GO REST.

30:26.595 --> 30:28.227
IT CAN BE HARD
FOR PARENTS TO WATCH.

30:28.227 --> 30:31.030

BUT I'M A DOCTOR, TOO.

OH, NO.

33:03.712 --> 33:05.984
IT IS 2012.
YOU WANT TO BE SHOCKED

33:05.984 --> 33:07.986

WITH A BLACK BABY...

33:07.986 --> 33:09.118
(lowered voice) YOU'RE ABOUT
THREE DECADES TOO LATE!

33:09.118 --> 33:10.659
I'M SORRY.
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

33:10.659 --> 33:11.690
(lowered voice)
WHAT--WHAT IS WRONG--

33:11.690 --> 33:13.062
SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE.

33:13.062 --> 33:14.393
SHE WAS NOT STARING AT YOU

33:14.393 --> 33:16.625
BECAUSE DADDY'S WHITE
AND HIS DAUGHTER IS BLACK.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.697
SHE WAS STARING AT YOU TWO

33:18.697 --> 33:20.769
BECAUSE DADDY HAS NICE HAIR,

33:20.769 --> 33:23.202
MAYBE PERFECT HAIR,
BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON,

33:23.202 --> 33:25.774
HIS DAUGHTER'S HAIR
IS 31 FLAVORS OF WRONG.

33:25.774 --> 33:27.376
IT'S HARD ON THE EYES.

33:27.376 --> 33:28.707
LOOK, YOU ARE WHITE,

33:28.707 --> 33:31.440

33:42.751 --> 33:44.123

33:44.123 --> 33:45.724
OW!
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

33:45.724 --> 33:48.597
YOU HAVE BONY, SHARP FINGERS.
WHAT PLAN? THERE'S NO PLAN.

33:48.597 --> 33:50.799

WHICH MAKES IT OUR PLAN.

33:50.799 --> 33:52.701

I NEED TO KNOW.

33:52.701 --> 33:54.703
ARE YOU PLOTTING A MURDER,
A NUCLEAR ATTACK?

33:54.703 --> 33:57.366
IT'S FINE. I'LL GET ON BOARD.
I'M SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON.

33:57.366 --> 34:00.409

34:16.655 --> 34:18.527
NO.

34:18.527 --> 34:20.159

SEE SOMETHING?

34:20.159 --> 34:21.760

34:22.691 --> 34:24.663
NO.
WELL, THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW--

34:24.663 --> 34:27.736
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW!
I JUST...

34:27.736 --> 34:29.168

34:37.646 --> 34:39.148

34:39.148 --> 34:41.810

34:44.313 --> 34:46.115
