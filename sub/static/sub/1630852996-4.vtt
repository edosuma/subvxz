It's a trial.

11:00.369 --> 11:02.496
I'm very sorry,

What is that meeting incidentally?
Who are you meeting?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.308
Ian, we're done.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.645

What's Project Beta?

11:28.480 --> 11:30.899

Yeah, and I tell you what.

the man with the sleeping bag.
DR. J: Yes, yes.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.143
But isn't the fact that they have

19:03.143 --> 19:06.146
such tight security proof
that they are legitimate?

19:06.146 --> 19:07.898
- If they would administer a test
and show us the labs,

19:07.898 --> 19:09.274
that would prove
that they're legitimate.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.360

how these start-ups work.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.154

19:14.154 --> 19:16.573
Why, why are they not
actively seeking FDA approval?

19:16.573 --> 19:20.369

before FDA approval all the time.

19:20.369 --> 19:22.287
- Right, but who is vetting them?
- Right.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.039

put in their own literature,

19:24.039 --> 19:27.000

uh, what is it?

19:28.126 --> 19:29.920

The economy is tanking.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.312
Start-ups are the only thing making money.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.939

19:55.696 --> 19:56.697
What's UberCab?

19:56.697 --> 19:59.992
- I believe it's where it lets you pay
for a cab on your phone.

19:59.992 --> 20:01.326
- Right? Is that right?
DR. J: That's right.

20:01.326 --> 20:03.704
- Jesus!
I could have thought of that.

20:03.704 --> 20:05.581
You could have used that, right, Wade?

20:07.499 --> 20:08.625
What do you mean?

20:09.418 --> 20:11.420
Because of that DUI you just got.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.844
Come on, we can laugh
about that, right?

20:22.639 --> 20:25.934

the device, the labs, everything.

who she's meeting or why?

21:05.474 --> 21:07.100
- No, no.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.977
I mean, you've been
working there for years.

21:08.977 --> 21:12.064

Elizabeth doesn't talk to me at all.

Well, who will talk to you?

21:32.334 --> 21:33.418
Cynthia.

21:34.545 --> 21:36.505
Ian, hi.

21:36.505 --> 21:39.591
- Listen, I know you're really busy,
but I just wondered, uh,

21:39.591 --> 21:41.969
is everyone here yet
for today's meeting?

21:41.969 --> 21:43.595
They're in the conference room.

21:46.682 --> 21:48.934
Elizabeth's with Sunny
finalizing something.

21:48.934 --> 21:50.811
They should be in there

21:50.811 --> 21:53.230
Were you going to that meeting?
I didn't have your name down.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.440
- No, no, no. You, you won't see
my name there.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.945
Um, E-Elizabeth asked if I could go
over the presentation materials.

21:59.945 --> 22:01.822
I just wondered if you had a copy.

22:01.822 --> 22:02.739
- Um--

22:03.657 --> 22:06.910
- Uh, she did say that I should ask you,
um, about Project Beta.

22:08.996 --> 22:11.498
Project Beta. Absolutely.

22:17.921 --> 22:19.965
Retail pitch deck tailored to Walgreens.

22:19.965 --> 22:21.008
- Wal-Walgreens?

22:21.008 --> 22:23.010
- Or did you want to see
the one for Safeway?

22:24.553 --> 22:27.264
No, this is, this is fine.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.645
- I never know what you guys
are doing down there in the labs,

22:33.645 --> 22:35.105
but it's so exciting.

22:35.814 --> 22:38.400
And Theranos is going
to be in stores! Hopefully.

22:39.818 --> 22:42.029
Let's see how the next couple days go.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.202

22:49.453 --> 22:51.538
- Oh, I think
they're coming out now.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.290
Did you want to give her your thoughts?

22:54.541 --> 22:59.129
♪

22:59.129 --> 23:02.257
♪

23:02.257 --> 23:04.968
♪

23:08.138 --> 23:11.225
- Gentlemen. Hello, hello, hello.
Hello, Wade.

23:11.225 --> 23:13.143
We are so happy you can join us here.

23:13.143 --> 23:15.562
- Great, thanks.
But I want to talk to you about why my--

23:15.562 --> 23:19.066
- Actually, we, uh, we'd like to present
to you something very special.

23:19.066 --> 23:20.442
In World War II,

23:20.442 --> 23:24.071
Walgreens put up a nonprofit pharmacy
in the Pentagon

23:24.071 --> 23:26.949
to give servicemen
the medicine they needed.

23:26.949 --> 23:29.493
And in the same spirit of patriotism,

23:29.493 --> 23:31.828
on behalf of all of us here at Theranos,

23:32.579 --> 23:34.331
we would like you to have this.

23:36.708 --> 23:41.588
This flag was just flown over
the battlefields of Afghanistan.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.548
Wow.

23:42.548 --> 23:45.676
ELIZABETH:
General Mattis has joined our board.

23:45.676 --> 23:48.178
- As you can see,
Elizabeth has signed the flag,

23:48.178 --> 23:50.055
especially for you, Wade.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.560
- You autographed a flag.
- This is great. Thanks.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.061
But we need to see the labs.

23:56.061 --> 23:59.523
- Wade, it's not possible
unless we have a deal in place.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.402
Shall we discuss over dinner?

24:03.402 --> 24:05.779
- We have--
- Reservations right now

24:05.779 --> 24:07.614
at one of the best restaurants
in the city.

24:08.824 --> 24:10.951
- Right now?
It's 3:30.

24:10.951 --> 24:12.035
We have a private room.

24:12.035 --> 24:14.538
For security reasons, we recommend
leaving at staggered intervals

24:14.538 --> 24:16.248
so no one will see us together.

24:16.248 --> 24:18.166
Oh, great idea. Should we?

24:18.166 --> 24:20.085
I mean, do you want us to go first or--

24:21.170 --> 24:23.589
Looks like this place has
some really good reviews on Yelp.

24:23.589 --> 24:25.465
Does it say if they have,
like, teriyaki or something?

24:25.465 --> 24:27.134
DR. J:
Oh, don't ask for teriyaki.

24:27.134 --> 24:28.927
-Why?
- There's teriya-- they do teriyaki.

24:28.927 --> 24:31.221
- Yeah, but this is like the premier
sushi restaurant in town.

24:31.221 --> 24:33.098
You don't want to order teriyaki.

24:33.098 --> 24:35.601
- You can get teriyaki.
- I've never had sushi.

24:35.601 --> 24:37.644
- No, it's insulting.
It's like ordering a cheeseburger.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.771
- I had teriyaki in Tokyo.
It was fine.

24:39.771 --> 24:40.731
Hey, Wade.

24:41.231 --> 24:42.566
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Wade.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.194
Oh, it's a big fucking secret
they're here.

24:45.194 --> 24:48.572
I mean, that's the most
recognizable car I've ever seen.

24:48.572 --> 24:50.199
It's cool, though, huh?

24:50.199 --> 24:52.826
You know, Wade, it's really good
that they're being so careful

24:52.826 --> 24:55.662
because you never know
who's watching you in Silicon Valley.

24:56.079 --> 24:58.874
- Jay, this is ridiculous, okay.
They're stalling.

24:58.874 --> 25:02.336
And if they can't commit to showing us
the labs at this dinner,

25:02.336 --> 25:03.795
we're walking, understood?

25:03.795 --> 25:05.464
- Good.
- Okay? Alright, let's go.

25:05.464 --> 25:06.673
- Thank you.
- Come on.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.800
Give us some sort of a signal
if you want us to leave.

25:12.513 --> 25:15.474
I think that's a Countach.
It's a style of Lamborghini.

25:15.474 --> 25:19.186
- They, uh, they gave us
a code name for the reservation.

25:19.603 --> 25:21.021
Oh, Jesus. What?

25:22.856 --> 25:24.316
Project Beta.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.575
Dr. J:
So this is the number one place in town?

25:40.165 --> 25:41.542
Two steps.

25:42.501 --> 25:43.961
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:45.504 --> 25:46.880
SUNNY:
So what are we eating?

25:46.880 --> 25:48.507
Does everyone like hamachi kama?

25:48.507 --> 25:49.925
Oh, my favorite.

25:50.509 --> 25:51.718
It's yellowtail cheeks.

25:53.303 --> 25:54.596
Um, you--

25:55.722 --> 25:58.058
- Should we sit?
- Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure.

25:58.058 --> 25:59.643
- Okay.
I'll go over here.

25:59.643 --> 26:00.811
Okay.

26:05.941 --> 26:08.318
- You alright? Oops.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

26:08.318 --> 26:10.737
- DR. J: Okay? Alright.
- Yup.

26:31.758 --> 26:32.676
Thanks.

26:33.427 --> 26:35.804
So what's going on?

26:37.514 --> 26:38.932
- Um--
- Ian, what is it?

26:38.932 --> 26:40.934
Is it the, the cancer?

26:40.934 --> 26:42.102
No.

26:42.102 --> 26:44.188
No, no, no. It's, it's--

26:44.188 --> 26:45.606
Elizabeth.

26:47.608 --> 26:49.026
I'm concerned.

26:50.485 --> 26:52.154
Well, then I'm concerned.

26:52.529 --> 26:53.739
- Things--

26:55.199 --> 26:57.492
Things have changed so much.

26:57.492 --> 26:59.286
She's changed so much.

26:59.286 --> 27:03.624
The voice, the turtleneck,
her whole demeanor.

27:03.624 --> 27:07.753
And Sunny, problematic.

27:07.753 --> 27:09.421
He's not everyone's cup of tea.

27:09.421 --> 27:10.714
It's not just him.

27:12.049 --> 27:13.300
What has she told you?

27:13.300 --> 27:14.885
About Sunny?

27:14.885 --> 27:18.430
No, about... what's happening?

27:19.765 --> 27:21.683
At Theranos?

27:21.683 --> 27:23.101
I know everything you know.

27:26.230 --> 27:27.397
Ian, talk to me.

27:28.106 --> 27:29.858
If there's something wrong,
I want to know.

27:29.858 --> 27:31.610
- I brought you into this.
- I know.

27:31.610 --> 27:33.278
I wanted to do this with you.

27:33.278 --> 27:34.488
I know!

27:34.488 --> 27:36.281
- Well, then, so if there's
something that--

27:36.281 --> 27:40.035
- She's planning to put
the machines into stores.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.623
With actual patients!

27:44.623 --> 27:47.543
Patients, Channing!

27:47.543 --> 27:49.586
Oh, this is about Walgreens?

27:51.171 --> 27:52.756
Did you know about that?

27:52.756 --> 27:54.550
Of course. I'm on the board.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.139
And... and you're all...

28:01.723 --> 28:03.016
you're all okay with it?

28:03.016 --> 28:04.434
Of course, we are.

28:06.019 --> 28:08.689
From what I understand,
the technology is almost there,

28:08.689 --> 28:10.816
and once it's out there,

28:10.816 --> 28:12.317
she wants to try to expand the board,

28:13.026 --> 28:14.945
make some government connections,

28:14.945 --> 28:17.364
try to fast track
the regulatory process.

28:17.364 --> 28:18.240
What--

28:19.616 --> 28:21.118
W-what's, what's the problem?

28:22.870 --> 28:25.080
What's the problem?

28:25.080 --> 28:30.002
The technology doesn't work.
It's years away. People will be at risk.

28:30.002 --> 28:32.546
Actual people, Channing.

28:33.505 --> 28:35.924
Actual... people.

28:40.637 --> 28:42.556
Do we put soy sauce on this?

28:42.556 --> 28:44.183
Just, just so I'm clear,

28:44.183 --> 28:45.642
when you're doing the PT test,

28:45.642 --> 28:48.896
you're adding the tissue factor
during the CBC.

28:49.980 --> 28:51.690
What about the anticoagulants?

28:51.690 --> 28:53.233
That's proprietary information.

28:53.233 --> 28:56.570
- Well, is it
proprietary information

28:56.570 --> 28:58.572
that I know you're talking
to Steve Burd at Safeway?

28:59.907 --> 29:01.074
Are you playing us?

29:01.074 --> 29:02.659
Because Safeway is a grocery,

29:02.659 --> 29:04.161
and we're a drug store.

29:04.912 --> 29:07.372
So how wide a net
are you casting exactly?

29:07.372 --> 29:09.374
As wide a net as we want.

29:09.374 --> 29:11.835
Our technology is
extremely valuable.

29:11.835 --> 29:15.380
- Really? Because I don't think
you're acting like a company

29:15.380 --> 29:17.132
that's financially solvent.

29:17.132 --> 29:19.635
I think you guys burn
through money fast,

29:19.635 --> 29:22.137
and now you're groping around
for a lifeline.

29:29.019 --> 29:31.688
- We're not the ones in need
of a lifeline here, Wade.

29:32.564 --> 29:33.899
Oh yeah?

29:34.316 --> 29:36.151
- Why were you a day late
to our meeting?

29:37.736 --> 29:39.488
That's proprietary information.

29:42.324 --> 29:45.953
- You were in the middle
of trying to renegotiate your deal

29:45.953 --> 29:47.329
with Express Scripts.

29:49.790 --> 29:53.210
Express Scripts is, what,
seven percent of your revenue,

29:53.210 --> 29:54.378
and, and they know that.

29:54.378 --> 29:56.004
And now they're gouging you

29:56.004 --> 29:58.340
on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.967
And you have to eat it.

30:01.218 --> 30:04.221
So you're going to have to find
a new source of revenue.

30:06.265 --> 30:08.016
For example, a wellness center.

30:08.016 --> 30:09.142
Oh, you're good.

30:11.186 --> 30:12.312
She's good.

30:12.312 --> 30:15.023
- Everyone is saying wellness,
what does wellness even mean?

30:15.023 --> 30:16.650
- To be well.
- Guys, okay.

30:17.943 --> 30:19.653
So what else do you know about us?

30:19.653 --> 30:21.947
- Retail's in freefall.
- Yeah, it's a recession.

30:21.947 --> 30:24.950
- And yet CVS's share
of prescription revenue

30:25.576 --> 30:26.910
has risen in the past year.

30:26.910 --> 30:28.662
- CVS sucks.
We hate CVS.

30:28.662 --> 30:31.248
- Are you talking to them?
Are you talking to CVS?

30:31.248 --> 30:34.543
- As I said, we are looking
for the right partners,

30:34.543 --> 30:37.129
partners who understand our vision.

30:37.129 --> 30:39.631
- So you're not going to tell us
who you're talking to.

30:44.928 --> 30:46.305
I went to your website,

30:46.305 --> 30:50.601
and I saw that you are
really embracing widgets.

30:50.601 --> 30:52.728
Is that, is that how you're going
to compete with Amazon

30:52.728 --> 30:54.938
because I think that you know, Wade,

30:54.938 --> 30:56.440
that you need to make a big move

30:56.440 --> 30:57.941
and you need to make that soon.

31:02.321 --> 31:07.201
- Well, I can't make any moves
until Kevin can assess the lab.

31:07.201 --> 31:08.994
Yes, please.

31:13.332 --> 31:14.583
Tomorrow morning?

31:15.250 --> 31:16.251
Tomorrow morning.

31:17.377 --> 31:19.254
- That's a guarantee?
- Can we get that in writing?

31:24.676 --> 31:26.845
Uh, you'll have to excuse me.

31:37.689 --> 31:38.649
Ian.

31:40.025 --> 31:41.235
Elizabeth.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.695
- I hear you wanted
to speak with me.

31:46.198 --> 31:48.158
- Where did,
where did you hear that?

31:48.825 --> 31:51.703
- From Channing Robertson?
He called me.

31:53.539 --> 31:55.040
Channing called you?

31:55.040 --> 31:56.625
You went to a board member

31:57.960 --> 31:59.419
behind my back.

32:00.003 --> 32:01.839
- But Channing is one
of my oldest friends.

32:01.839 --> 32:03.048
You went behind my back.

32:04.675 --> 32:06.718
- I-I would have gone
just to you, but--

32:07.636 --> 32:10.556
Well, we don't speak anymore, do we?

32:11.431 --> 32:13.100
And ever since Sunny started--

32:13.100 --> 32:14.476
- Don't blame this on Sunny. He's--

32:16.061 --> 32:17.855
He kept this company alive, okay.

32:17.855 --> 32:19.189
He understands the business.

32:19.189 --> 32:22.943
You can't put this in stores!

32:23.652 --> 32:26.446
You can't let people,

32:26.446 --> 32:28.657
human beings,

32:28.657 --> 32:30.951
be tested with this machine.

32:30.951 --> 32:32.703
- What-- what do you want me to do?

32:34.538 --> 32:36.456
I'm trying to keep your research funded.

32:36.456 --> 32:38.292
It's not about my research!

32:38.292 --> 32:40.085
- We need a long-term contract.

32:40.085 --> 32:41.253
No. No!

32:41.253 --> 32:43.255
- Which we couldn't get
from pharmaceutical companies.

32:43.255 --> 32:44.548
- No.
- So now we're trying with retail.

32:44.548 --> 32:46.884
- You must get your money from
somewhere else. You've done it before.

32:46.884 --> 32:48.927
I don't need your advice on this, Ian.

32:49.386 --> 32:50.971
You don't understand the business.

32:50.971 --> 32:53.473
And you don't understand the science!

33:00.022 --> 33:03.233
You don't understand the implications

33:03.233 --> 33:04.860
of what you're doing.

33:04.860 --> 33:05.944
No.

33:06.653 --> 33:07.654
You're wrong.

33:09.198 --> 33:11.283
I understand exactly what I'm doing.

33:16.246 --> 33:17.497
You're fired.

33:19.041 --> 33:20.125
No.

33:20.584 --> 33:21.752
You can't--

33:22.878 --> 33:24.588
We built this together.

33:24.588 --> 33:26.632
I-I'm part of this.

33:26.632 --> 33:28.884
- No, we don't share
the same vision anymore.

33:30.844 --> 33:32.346
I need to work.

33:32.346 --> 33:34.306
I, I want to work.

33:34.306 --> 33:36.141
- Your belongings will be sent
to your home address,

33:36.141 --> 33:38.477
and you will sign the paperwork

33:38.477 --> 33:40.854
that the legal team
sends to you immediately.

33:40.854 --> 33:42.064
Please.

33:57.329 --> 33:59.289
- Go. You need to,
you need to leave.

34:00.082 --> 34:02.543
I don't need to be escorted out.

34:02.543 --> 34:03.752
It's protocol.

34:54.970 --> 34:56.430
What's going on?

How much did you drink?
