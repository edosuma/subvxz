WEBVTT

00:27.000 --> 00:29.917
So, is that a maybe yes?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.333
Or a maybe, maybe?

00:31.417 --> 00:34.333
It's a...maybe yes.

00:34.417 --> 00:36.583
Maybe Friday night then?

00:36.667 --> 00:37.959
We're not talking
about when.

00:38.041 --> 00:39.709
We're still on
different types of maybes.

00:39.792 --> 00:41.291
I've known you
since I was 12.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.041
Maybe I can confuse you,
speed things up a little
bit?

00:44.125 --> 00:45.709
Huh?

00:45.792 --> 00:47.917
Don't kiss me so close
to your father's store.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.834
Don't worry.
He's not the jealous
type.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.875
I know exactly what your
father thinks of me.

00:52.959 --> 00:56.500
If my father knew you, he'd like
you even more than he likes me.

00:56.583 --> 01:00.750
You're just trying to change
my maybe yes into a yes, yes.

01:00.834 --> 01:01.959
Is it working?

01:03.583 --> 01:05.083
(Tam)
'I got to go.'

01:05.166 --> 01:06.458
They're starting without me.

01:06.542 --> 01:07.959
You coming tomorrow night?

01:08.041 --> 01:09.750
You've been practicing all
week.
I'm not going to miss it.

01:09.834 --> 01:11.041
Okay.

01:12.083 --> 01:14.166
Look out.
Your cousin's coming.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.583
Hey, Jack,
I just won
$20.

01:16.667 --> 01:17.709
They let you
in the
casino?

01:17.792 --> 01:19.125
I was outside,
playing dice.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.166
You're supposed to be
watching your little
sister.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.125
(Warren)
'Hey, watch where you're
going.'

01:28.417 --> 01:29.709
Have a good day.

01:31.583 --> 01:32.959
(Jack)
'Hey, pops.'

01:34.417 --> 01:37.041
Thank you, this orange tree
will bring us luck.

01:42.375 --> 01:43.500
Why do you bother
buying the tree?

01:43.583 --> 01:44.750
Why don't you just
give them the cash?

01:44.834 --> 01:46.458
The tree brings us luck.

01:46.542 --> 01:48.792
- It brings us flies.
- 'You're already late.'

01:48.875 --> 01:50.500
Haven't you insulted
me
enough today?

01:50.583 --> 01:52.250
Come on, I was kidding.

01:52.333 --> 01:53.792
'Dad.'

01:57.041 --> 01:59.291
Hope you're
kidding
about that girl.

01:59.375 --> 02:01.792
Dad finds out,
he'll have a
stroke.

02:01.875 --> 02:03.625
What's he going to do
when I marry her?

02:03.709 --> 02:05.083
Don't talk about
that.
Marriage--

02:05.166 --> 02:06.500
Is serious.

02:11.417 --> 02:12.625
You're a little punk.

02:12.709 --> 02:13.875
You need to grow up.

02:13.959 --> 02:16.583
Why, 'cause you make it
seem like so much fun?

02:35.375 --> 02:36.750
The usual, John.

02:36.834 --> 02:38.125
Don't tell me.

02:38.208 --> 02:40.875
Nobody saw anything
and nobody knows nothing.

02:40.959 --> 02:42.208
Nothing.

02:58.750 --> 03:01.834
People call in sick
all the time.

03:01.917 --> 03:04.333
You see my other shoe?

03:04.417 --> 03:06.583
I mean, the boss don't care.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.458
When's the last time
you called in sick?

03:09.542 --> 03:11.125
Oh, I don't know.

03:17.041 --> 03:19.333
You know what?
He'll buy it.

03:20.667 --> 03:24.458
Then what? Just stay
cooped up in here all
day?

03:24.542 --> 03:25.959
You know if you wanna go out

03:26.041 --> 03:28.500
all you got to do
is say the word.

03:30.041 --> 03:31.583
Oh, got it.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.875
'Yeah, I can hear it
in your voice.'

03:33.959 --> 03:36.709
You're definitely
coming
down with something.

03:36.792 --> 03:40.208
Thanks, doc, but, uh,
I got to go.

03:40.291 --> 03:42.041
Duty calls.

03:42.125 --> 03:43.583
Hey. Hey, hey.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.041
Let me look at
that face
again.

03:54.375 --> 03:57.750
Hey, boss, uh, there's a woman
here says her son Chao Lu

03:57.834 --> 03:59.041
was shot and killed in '83.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.792
He's your case.

04:06.542 --> 04:08.125
Jack Chao Lu.

04:08.208 --> 04:09.458
Jack?

04:09.542 --> 04:11.417
A young kid in Chinatown.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.333
Gang-related.
She got something new?

04:14.417 --> 04:16.375
Won't say
till she talks to
you.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.542
Mrs. Lu,
I'm Lieutenant Stillman.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.500
Do you remember my son?

04:24.583 --> 04:25.709
I do.

04:25.792 --> 04:26.959
I remember you as well.

04:27.041 --> 04:28.166
Then I apologize

04:28.250 --> 04:31.000
for the last time
we saw each other.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.834
Mr. and Mrs. Lu, I know
that this is a difficult
time--

04:41.917 --> 04:43.166
Leave us be.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.625
We have nothing to tell you.

04:44.709 --> 04:46.959
It's important, I get
information about your
son

04:47.041 --> 04:48.875
as soon as possible.

04:55.959 --> 04:59.041
My husband wouldn't allow
us
to talk to the police.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.792
I respected
his wishes.

05:00.875 --> 05:02.583
Recently he passed away.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.750
And now you want to talk?

05:07.583 --> 05:09.625
Jack was not in a gang.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.875
He was in love
with this girl from
Vietnam.

05:11.959 --> 05:14.083
It was very
shameful
for both kinds.

05:14.166 --> 05:15.333
Both kinds?

05:15.417 --> 05:17.208
My husband and I
are from China.

05:17.291 --> 05:20.583
Her family are Chinese,
but they came from
Vietnam.

05:20.667 --> 05:21.959
'No good.'

05:22.041 --> 05:24.041
You think dating this girl
got your son killed?

05:24.125 --> 05:26.750
In our culture we take
tradition
very seriously.

05:26.834 --> 05:29.709
Mrs. Lu, who else knew
that Jack had a girlfriend?

05:29.792 --> 05:31.542
I kept it a secret.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.083
My husband was
very
traditional.

05:34.166 --> 05:37.667
But for me, they
were
just kids in love.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.125
What's the girl's name?

05:39.208 --> 05:40.417
Tam Sung.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.625
- She was very beautiful.
- Was?

05:42.709 --> 05:44.041
She was shot and killed

05:44.125 --> 05:46.458
three months before
my son was murdered.

05:46.542 --> 05:48.709
(Scotty)
'You thought Jack's
murder was related'

05:48.792 --> 05:50.417
to another killing
and you didn't say anything

05:50.500 --> 05:52.583
about it for 26 years?

05:52.667 --> 05:56.041
I know you don't
understand,
but I had no choice.

05:56.125 --> 05:58.792
Mrs. Lu, this information
would have helped

05:58.875 --> 06:00.709
the investigation
back then.

06:00.792 --> 06:03.333
Am I too late, lieutenant?

06:39.375 --> 06:42.291
Jack Chao Lu, 17 years old.
Shot by a nine-millimeter.

06:42.375 --> 06:45.250
Two in the back, one in
the head, close range.

06:45.333 --> 06:47.000
I see why you went
with gang execution.

06:47.083 --> 06:48.792
Chinese gangs were
at war back then.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.166
Lot of casualties.
This kid was a good
student.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.542
I couldn't find the connect.

06:52.625 --> 06:55.041
- Which gang came out on top?
- Dragon Boys.

06:55.125 --> 06:58.375
Gun-toting punks prided
themselves on having no
limits.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.000
Extortion,
kidnapping,
murder..

07:00.083 --> 07:01.417
Are they still
running things?

07:01.500 --> 07:03.583
Far as I know, not much you can
do when no one

07:03.667 --> 07:05.041
will cooperate or testify.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.208
2,000 years of culture says,
don't talk to police.

07:08.291 --> 07:09.834
Hard to fight that.

07:09.917 --> 07:11.750
We started hiring
cops
in the late '80s

07:11.834 --> 07:13.667
that spoke
Mandarin,
some Cantonese.

07:13.750 --> 07:16.667
I'll talk to the Asian Gang
Unit
see if we made any progress.

07:16.750 --> 07:17.750
Hmm.

07:17.834 --> 07:19.166
This the girl
Jack was dating?

07:19.250 --> 07:21.458
Yeah, Tam Sung, 17.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.333
'Gang shootout
during a street festival.'

07:23.417 --> 07:25.291
Caught in the cross-fire.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.458
No witnesses,
no leads?

07:27.542 --> 07:29.166
Looked like a stray bullet.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.041
'Assigned didn't get
much further than that.'

07:31.125 --> 07:33.333
Three months later,
Jack winds up dead.

07:33.417 --> 07:34.500
Rotten coincidence.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.667
'Compounded
by Tam Sung's father.'

07:36.750 --> 07:39.375
Registered a gun in 1980.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.333
Nine-millimeter.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.041
Tam was my only girl.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.208
'She wanted
to be a dancer.'

07:45.291 --> 07:46.667
Was she dating anyone?

07:46.750 --> 07:49.417
No, she was too young.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.041
But very beautiful.

07:52.125 --> 07:54.041
I knew when she grew up

07:54.125 --> 07:55.083
I'd be in trouble.

07:55.166 --> 07:56.709
Still got that nine-millimeter

07:56.792 --> 08:00.041
'you bought in 1980, Joe?'

08:00.125 --> 08:01.709
I don't understand.

08:02.959 --> 08:04.583
Do you have new lead
on who killed my Tam?

08:04.667 --> 08:06.667
Answer the question,
Mr. Sung.

08:06.750 --> 08:09.375
I have the gun.
Locked up at home.

08:09.458 --> 08:11.417
Mind if we take a ride
with you to go get it?

08:11.500 --> 08:13.875
What's going on?
Why did you bring me here?

08:13.959 --> 08:16.291
You remember a kid
named Jack Lu?

08:18.959 --> 08:21.583
Do you think I would
kill
someone else's child

08:21.667 --> 08:23.375
after losing my Tam?

08:23.458 --> 08:25.375
'I would never hurt this boy..'

08:25.458 --> 08:27.750
...no matter
what his family think.

08:27.834 --> 08:29.417
How do you know
what they think?

08:29.500 --> 08:31.583
I had no problem with Jack, huh?

08:31.667 --> 08:34.291
But his father
looked down on my daughter.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.750
So you knew
she was seeing Jack?

08:35.834 --> 08:37.417
I knew he was interested in her.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.250
After she died,
did you confront him?

08:39.333 --> 08:40.875
No, after the funeral

08:40.959 --> 08:43.750
my wife and I went to Tianjin
to be with family.

08:43.834 --> 08:45.500
Gone six months.
Look for yourself.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.792
- Don't worry. We will.
- Good.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.291
Then look into
the murder of my daughter.

08:49.375 --> 08:51.583
We are, but we
need your help.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.375
I can't help.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.917
I was right there.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.166
The shooting started
and I couldn't do
anything.

09:40.125 --> 09:43.000
(Jack)
'I'm here. You-you're okay.'

09:43.083 --> 09:44.208
You're okay.

09:45.834 --> 09:47.083
No!

09:48.000 --> 09:49.458
No, no.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.125
God, no.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.208
We got to get
out of here.

09:54.291 --> 09:55.792
- Go without me.
- The police are coming.

09:55.875 --> 09:58.500
I saw 'em, three guys
with masks, dragon tattoos.

09:58.583 --> 10:01.166
One of them had an Uzi.
We've got to tell somebody.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.709
- Keep your mouth shut.
- We got to tell somebody.

10:02.792 --> 10:05.000
No, keep your mouth shut.
Get up. Come on. Let's go.

10:05.083 --> 10:06.750
Get up. Get up.
Let's go.

10:10.792 --> 10:13.542
I didn't know
how much he loved her.

10:13.625 --> 10:16.166
Those tattoos, it was
the Dragon Boys

10:16.250 --> 10:17.834
who did the shooting?

10:17.917 --> 10:20.250
I-I didn't see,
but we all knew.

10:20.333 --> 10:23.959
After the shooting, did Jack
mention going to the police?

10:24.041 --> 10:26.083
We never spoke again.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.583
I saw him
at Tam's
funeral

10:27.667 --> 10:31.333
but I was too
upset
to reach out.

10:32.834 --> 10:34.417
Wish I had.

10:35.291 --> 10:37.542
Alright, call me back.
Bye.

10:37.625 --> 10:39.917
(Will)
Thinking Jack might have
reached out to the police

10:40.000 --> 10:42.375
about Tam's murder.

10:42.458 --> 10:45.417
Ray Bianchi worked the Chinatown
narcotics unit back then.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.875
Said he'd never heard
of the kid.

10:46.959 --> 10:49.834
I'll run Jack's name through
NCIC, see if anything pops.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.041
Yeah, the Chinese go to the tong

10:51.125 --> 10:52.709
with problems
not the department.

10:52.792 --> 10:55.000
- The tong?
- 'Local Chinese merchants.'

10:55.083 --> 10:57.208
Lot of money, power.

10:57.291 --> 10:59.041
Fund the Chinese Trade Alliance.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.041
The CTA gives
out scholarships

11:01.125 --> 11:03.375
uh, helps immigrants
get jobs, loans.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.959
Sounds good.
What am I missing?

11:06.041 --> 11:09.625
Well, Kim Sing tong
also controls the Dragon Boys.

11:09.709 --> 11:10.959
Money from the heroin trade.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.750
Gang moves the drugs,
runs the brothels, casinos..

11:13.834 --> 11:16.333
The tong gets rich, but never
gets their hands dirty.

11:16.417 --> 11:19.917
So, a bunch of old
businessmen
control the gangs?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.250
Tong's like Chinese Mob.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.375
Only harder to crack.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.375
The tong never deals
directly with the gangs.

11:25.458 --> 11:28.917
Always through a go-between
<i>dai lo.</i>

11:29.000 --> 11:30.583
Department can't touch the tong

11:30.667 --> 11:33.250
'cause we never knew
dai lo

11:33.333 --> 11:34.625
(John)
'Yeah, we still don't.'

11:34.709 --> 11:37.917
It took 26 years for Jack's
mother to come forward.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.792
Let's find out
what the brother knows.

11:47.792 --> 11:50.667
Detectives Rush,
Valens, homicide.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.250
I'll be right with
you,
detectives.

11:53.709 --> 11:54.834
You don't need to close.

11:54.917 --> 11:56.583
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

11:56.667 --> 12:00.125
It'll be easier to talk
without
customers coming in and out.

12:00.208 --> 12:01.625
Please.

12:03.709 --> 12:05.667
(Scotty)
'You know your brother
had a girlfriend?'

12:05.750 --> 12:07.959
I was with him
when Tam got killed.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.750
I had no idea
my mother knew about her

12:09.834 --> 12:12.083
until she said she was going
to the police yesterday.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.959
You don't think she should
help
find your brother's killer?

12:15.041 --> 12:16.458
You don't understand.

12:16.542 --> 12:18.291
My father didn't want us
talking to the police.

12:18.375 --> 12:19.959
Well, you're right.
We don't understand.

12:20.041 --> 12:21.375
Think you'd want justice.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.709
American justice doesn't work
for people in Chinatown.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.291
Well, it definitely
won't
if you don't tell us

12:25.375 --> 12:27.834
what's going on,
that's for sure.

12:27.917 --> 12:30.417
Alright, say I get robbed
and I tell you who did it

12:30.500 --> 12:34.959
you arrest them, they get out
on bail and burn down my
store.

12:35.041 --> 12:37.333
Who pays to rebuild?
Not the police.

12:37.417 --> 12:39.709
Jack feel the same as
you
about talking to cops?

12:39.792 --> 12:41.667
Jack thought he was American,
not Chinese.

12:41.750 --> 12:45.083
I'm getting the impression
you two didn't get along.

12:45.166 --> 12:48.625
We were different,
but I loved my brother.

12:48.709 --> 12:51.166
I wish I'd tried to understand
him when I had the chance.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.500
Did Jack say he knew
who killed Tam?

12:53.583 --> 12:56.083
He thought it was
the Dragon Boys.

12:56.166 --> 12:59.375
Didn't know which one
so he was angry at them all.

13:01.291 --> 13:04.083
Thank you, this tree
will bring us much luck.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.667
We don't want
your orange tree.

13:08.750 --> 13:12.375
[scoffs]
Your pop already paid me.
See you next week.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.542
I said we don't want
the stupid tree.

13:14.625 --> 13:16.208
You're kidding, right?

13:16.291 --> 13:17.709
- Jack!
- I apologize for my son.

13:17.792 --> 13:20.375
We're not paying
for your junk
anymore.

13:20.458 --> 13:21.500
Ah-ho.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.000
What's going on here?

13:28.083 --> 13:31.125
Bo-Lin, we are fortunate
you came when you did.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.709
My son thanks you.

13:40.875 --> 13:43.041
Jack could have got
us all killed.

13:43.125 --> 13:44.417
You know who the thug was?

13:44.500 --> 13:46.375
Dragon Boy named Danny Yo.

13:46.458 --> 13:49.041
- Long dead.
- 'Who's this Bo-Lin?'

13:49.125 --> 13:50.875
(Scotty)
'Sounds like Danny Yo
was terrified of him.'

13:50.959 --> 13:53.041
(Ling)
'Terror is different
than respect.'

13:53.125 --> 13:56.000
Bo-Lin Chen is a very
respected man around here.

13:57.291 --> 13:58.583
(Scotty)
'CTA.'

13:58.667 --> 13:59.917
Chinese Trade Alliance.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.250
That's right.
My father was a businessman.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.250
Jack have a problem
with Bo-Lin Chen?

14:04.333 --> 14:05.917
No, I don't think so.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.166
'Bo-Lin was a great
friend to our family.'

14:08.250 --> 14:10.917
Do you have
any chrysanthemum tea here?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.375
I look for it everywhere.

14:12.458 --> 14:15.583
We ran out.
Um, just ordered some
more.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.542
Try the jasmine.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.250
You knew Jack Lu?

14:21.959 --> 14:23.333
He's my cousin.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.500
Um..

14:27.583 --> 14:30.417
Guess I'll just
have to come back
then.

14:41.750 --> 14:45.417
Danny Yo was shot
and killed in 1985.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.333
- No witnesses.
- No leads?

14:48.417 --> 14:51.083
But he was bailed out
three times.

14:51.166 --> 14:54.792
Bail slip always signed
by Mr. Bo-Lin Chen.

14:56.625 --> 14:59.083
Well, Ling didn't say
Mr. Do-gooder was involved

14:59.166 --> 15:00.625
with a thug like Danny Yo.

15:00.709 --> 15:02.291
Could be scared of him.

15:02.375 --> 15:04.709
Today Chen is
the president of the CTA.

15:04.792 --> 15:07.625
But back in '83,
he was on the front lines.

15:07.709 --> 15:10.333
Racketeering,
heroin trafficking..

15:10.417 --> 15:11.709
Charges all dropped.

15:11.792 --> 15:13.917
Witnesses never made it
to trial.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.041
Two to the body,
one to the head.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.792
Just like Jack.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.250
Bo-Lin was the connect
between the tong and the
gang.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.583
<i>dai lo.</i>

15:47.375 --> 15:49.500
Detectives,
how can I help you?

15:49.583 --> 15:51.333
Jack Chao Lu.

15:51.417 --> 15:52.667
You remember him?

15:52.750 --> 15:54.542
Oh, yes, of course.

15:54.625 --> 15:55.625
Hong Lu's son.

15:55.709 --> 15:57.333
Got killed
by street gangs, I think.

15:57.417 --> 15:58.458
Very tragic.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.083
We're looking
at the Dragon
Boys.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.208
I'm sure you're familiar.

16:01.291 --> 16:02.875
Gangs are horrible
for Chinatown.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.333
I've always tried
to get rid of them.

16:04.417 --> 16:06.500
That why your name is on
a dozen of their bail
slips?

16:06.583 --> 16:07.750
(John)
'Putting bangers
back on the street'

16:07.834 --> 16:10.208
your idea of cleaning
up
Chinatown?

16:10.291 --> 16:13.542
[laughing]
No, you misunderstand.

16:13.625 --> 16:16.291
I run the CTA
scholarship fund.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.542
We try to help children
who lost their way.

16:18.625 --> 16:20.083
Alright, drop
the act,
Bo-Lin.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.417
We know that you were
dai lo
1983.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.291
If Jack was targeted
it went through you.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.041
I'm just a local businessman.

16:26.125 --> 16:27.875
I wanna help,
but I don't know anything.

16:27.959 --> 16:29.542
Just tell us who had
a problem with Jack.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.041
We'll leave you alone.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.709
Otherwise we gotta
start
looking into your
affairs.

16:33.792 --> 16:36.125
It's your time
to waste, detective.

16:36.208 --> 16:39.291
I've been a friend to
the department for many years.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.917
That's what you'll find.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.709
This ain't going away, friend.

16:43.750 --> 16:46.166
Have a nice day, detectives.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.375
Huh.

16:57.166 --> 16:59.500
(Scotty)
'Yeah, I'm looking
for Emil Parker.'

16:59.583 --> 17:02.166
Okay, do you have
his new number?

17:02.250 --> 17:04.083
Well, he's not in any
trouble,
I just need to talk to him

17:04.166 --> 17:07.583
about something he saw
at the Dayley's parking lot.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.709
Ma'am?
Hello?

17:09.792 --> 17:11.208
Uh, who's printing

17:11.291 --> 17:12.417
five trees of paper?

17:12.500 --> 17:13.875
What are you looking for?

17:13.959 --> 17:16.000
"Chapter two.
Some elevator repairman
found

17:16.083 --> 17:18.083
"her rolled up in an old
throw
rug, fair-skinned

17:18.166 --> 17:19.875
"and
raven-haired."
Is that yours?

17:19.959 --> 17:21.500
What a man prints
is his own business.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.750
Oh, sorry, just trying
to do a little police
business.

17:24.834 --> 17:25.917
What'd you find?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.709
Jack talked to a
cop
after all.

17:27.792 --> 17:29.583
Two months before he died
someone logged him

17:29.667 --> 17:31.291
in as a ped stop.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.291
- Who?
- I'm trying to print that
out.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.625
But now it's in all this mess.

17:40.083 --> 17:42.291
Ray Bianchi, narcotics.

17:42.375 --> 17:46.417
Didn't boss say he asked
Bianchi
about Jack back in the day?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.000
Said he'd never heard
of the kid.

17:50.291 --> 17:51.542
I'm sorry, John.

17:51.625 --> 17:55.125
I want to help, but,
uh,
that was 26 years
ago.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.333
Uh, let me
refresh your memory.

17:57.417 --> 17:59.792
Jack Chao Lu.

17:59.875 --> 18:03.000
You stopped him outside
the 10th Street casino.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.208
June 15, 1983.

18:08.125 --> 18:10.875
You know how many Chinese kids
I stopped outside that casino?

18:10.959 --> 18:12.041
Come on.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.291
Back then you and me
both had a seat

18:13.375 --> 18:14.875
at Jimmy's
Thursday night game

18:14.959 --> 18:16.667
seven-card stud,
remember that?

18:16.750 --> 18:19.291
Of course, till the
wife
shut it down.

18:19.375 --> 18:20.917
One night at the table
I asked you.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.917
You said you never heard of him.

18:24.458 --> 18:28.333
Well...if that's what I said,
then I guess I had my reasons.

18:28.417 --> 18:31.083
I was working a homicide, Ray.

18:38.959 --> 18:40.166
Okay, look.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.417
I was on a joint task
force
with the Feds.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.834
Heroin trafficking.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.166
It was big.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.792
I beat my head against
the wall on this case.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.959
It was cold before the kid
was in the ground.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.125
Believe me, anything I had
on him wouldn't have helped
you.

18:52.208 --> 18:53.959
That was my call to make,
not yours.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.709
I'm sorry, John.

18:55.792 --> 18:58.625
I couldn't out myself
even after the kid got
killed.

18:58.709 --> 18:59.709
He was an informant?

18:59.792 --> 19:01.959
No, he was just a young kid

19:02.041 --> 19:04.000
looking for revenge.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.709
(Ray)
'Move out.'

19:27.792 --> 19:30.166
You, drop the knife.

19:32.834 --> 19:34.583
Get up on here.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.375
You are one dumb kid.

19:42.458 --> 19:44.417
They had guns and you
arrest me for a knife?

19:44.500 --> 19:46.166
I am not arresting you.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.291
I'm saving your ass.
What the hell were you
thinking?

19:48.375 --> 19:49.750
Just want to know
which one of them did it.

19:49.834 --> 19:52.458
- Did what, kid?
- My girl got shot.

19:53.875 --> 19:55.250
And nobody cares.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.041
Going after some Dragon Boy
won't make a difference.

19:58.125 --> 19:59.583
'You're just like
the rest of them.'

19:59.667 --> 20:01.250
You accept it how it is,
and you don't do anything.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.792
No, the department
is going after the
guys

20:03.875 --> 20:05.000
that run
the street
gangs.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.583
The heroin smugglers.

20:06.667 --> 20:09.542
And you, I want you
to stay away from those
thugs.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.750
You hear me?

20:10.834 --> 20:13.041
Then tell me what to do.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.959
I gotta do something.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.959
Had a flophouse
out in Fairhill.

20:20.041 --> 20:21.250
Paid the kid
a few bucks to come

20:21.333 --> 20:22.875
out once a week
and translate
tapes.

20:22.959 --> 20:24.417
God knows we
needed the
help.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.583
The Feds had translators.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.625
You didn't need
to get Jack involved.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.792
One guy spoke Cantonese.

20:29.875 --> 20:32.291
Came down from New York
twice a month.

20:32.375 --> 20:34.750
What was on those tapes?

20:34.834 --> 20:37.583
Not much, couple small
drug busts, that's it.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.000
I want the transcripts.

20:40.083 --> 20:43.583
Feds got that stuff.
I..
If they even still
have it.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.333
Call who you gotta call.

20:54.458 --> 20:56.500
(Lilly)
Yeah, I'll wait.

21:02.208 --> 21:03.917
I got all day.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.500
Uh, I'll call you back.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.500
Detective Rush?

21:07.583 --> 21:09.041
I brought you that tea
that you like.

21:09.125 --> 21:10.625
Well, thank you.

21:10.709 --> 21:12.709
Here, have a seat.

21:12.792 --> 21:16.667
Is there a...place
we could, uh, talk?

21:19.125 --> 21:20.917
I'm gonna make
some of this
tea.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.375
Want some?

21:27.500 --> 21:30.792
I worked at Hong Sheng Long
since I was a kid.

21:30.875 --> 21:34.208
Stock shelves,
deliveries,
whatever they need.

21:34.291 --> 21:36.875
Well, it sounds like you
gave
your life to that store.

21:36.959 --> 21:39.625
I owe them
at least that much.

21:39.709 --> 21:42.208
Why's that, Warren?

21:44.625 --> 21:47.500
You know, coming in here
took courage.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.083
No.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.041
I'm not that kind of person.

21:51.125 --> 21:53.000
You're here, aren't you?

21:53.083 --> 21:57.458
I used to want to be
like, like the Dragon
Boys.

21:57.542 --> 22:00.458
You know,
not afraid of anything.

22:00.542 --> 22:03.291
But it was Jack
who had the real
courage

22:03.375 --> 22:04.709
not me.

22:06.041 --> 22:08.333
[panting]
They took Stacey, Jack.

22:08.417 --> 22:09.917
I couldn't stop 'em.
They had guns.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.417
Calm down.
Just tell me what
happened.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.041
Supposed to watch my sister,
so I figured I'd take her

22:13.125 --> 22:14.875
to the arcade, just-just
for a little while.

22:15.000 --> 22:15.959
Which arcade?

22:16.041 --> 22:17.375
One near
the Tenth Street casino.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.792
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I screwed up!

22:19.875 --> 22:21.667
Bunch of Dragon Boys,
they told me..

22:21.750 --> 22:24.000
They told me to bring money
to this address.

22:24.083 --> 22:25.709
- They're going to kill
Stacey.
- Okay, okay.

22:25.792 --> 22:27.458
- Just let me think.
- What am I going to do?

22:27.542 --> 22:29.000
All they want is the money.
They're gonna give her back.

22:29.083 --> 22:31.792
They said they want $360
for luck.

22:38.834 --> 22:40.834
Warren, look at me.
Go home, okay?

22:40.917 --> 22:42.959
I'm gonna try
and bring her back to you.

22:44.208 --> 22:49.041
A van...dropped off
Stacey
few hours later.

22:49.125 --> 22:50.709
Then what happened to Jack?

22:50.792 --> 22:53.041
I found out the next
day
he was dead.

22:53.125 --> 22:54.834
You ask Stacey
what she saw?

22:54.917 --> 22:57.333
She didn't talk for a week.

22:57.417 --> 23:01.792
Made her promise not to tell
anyone what happened.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.417
She never trusted me again.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.000
We'll need to talk to Stacey.

23:05.083 --> 23:06.125
We don't talk anymore.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.709
She never comes
back to visit.

23:08.792 --> 23:10.834
If I could just go back..

23:12.083 --> 23:15.333
...I would have
brought
the money myself.

23:27.291 --> 23:29.375
(Eddie)
'Hey, gorgeous.'

23:29.458 --> 23:32.750
What's that you said,
I never take you out?

23:34.792 --> 23:36.750
No, not like that.

23:36.834 --> 23:38.542
What's the matter?
You don't like Italian?

23:38.625 --> 23:40.834
Food or the car?

23:42.417 --> 23:45.875
I know this great little
place
down the Shore. Come on.

23:45.959 --> 23:47.875
The Shore?

23:47.959 --> 23:49.417
How fast is that car?

23:49.500 --> 23:51.959
I'll get you
home
before sun-up.

23:59.750 --> 24:02.959
(Lilly)
Haven't done this
in a while.

24:03.041 --> 24:05.750
(Eddie)
What's that, skeeball
or the go-carts?

24:05.834 --> 24:07.250
Watch the sun
come up.

24:07.333 --> 24:08.625
Oh, that.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.500
It's good.

24:11.583 --> 24:14.667
I'm sorry I got us
kicked out back there.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.792
You ran a 10-year-old kid
off the track.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.417
Hey, him or me.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.542
Yeah, well, punk
tried
to box me in.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.208
Should see me
on the bumper
cars.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.083
So the wine,
the food..

24:28.166 --> 24:29.583
...the Maserati?

24:32.250 --> 24:34.875
What, you don't
think
I can rock that?

24:34.959 --> 24:36.500
I know what you make.

24:36.583 --> 24:38.375
You gotta play
the part
sometimes.

24:38.458 --> 24:41.041
You know I thought you
might get a kick out
of it.

24:41.125 --> 24:42.834
Oh, no, I did.

24:43.625 --> 24:46.125
It was fun.
Thanks.

24:46.208 --> 24:49.125
Figured diamond studs might seem
a little too forward, you know.

24:49.208 --> 24:52.083
Oh, yeah, this is
much more subtle.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.959
It's not a rental.

24:55.458 --> 24:58.041
Figured since
you're my girl and
all.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.333
Oh, it's-it's beautiful.

25:05.458 --> 25:07.583
I can't...wear this around.

25:07.667 --> 25:08.917
Not on my salary.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.834
Hold on to it
till the next time we go
out.

25:13.834 --> 25:16.417
Let me guess.
No returns or exchanges?

25:16.500 --> 25:18.208
You don't like it?

25:18.291 --> 25:20.750
Oh, I-I didn't
say that.

25:20.834 --> 25:23.750
Just don't throw it
in the Schuylkill.

25:26.083 --> 25:27.333
Hey.

25:30.333 --> 25:31.750
Thank you.

25:38.291 --> 25:39.709
But...what?

25:39.792 --> 25:41.625
You lied.

25:41.709 --> 25:44.208
Said you'd get me
back
before sun-up.

25:44.291 --> 25:45.625
Come on.

25:54.208 --> 25:55.667
You don't mind,
I'll give that back to you

25:55.750 --> 25:56.709
when we're done here.

25:56.792 --> 25:57.917
I don't mean to be rude

25:58.000 --> 26:00.291
but I've got a
condo
showing at 11:00.

26:00.375 --> 26:03.166
When was the last time you saw
your cousin Jack Lu?

26:03.250 --> 26:05.959
I'm not sure, he died when I
was
just a little kid.

26:06.041 --> 26:07.959
You remember being kidnapped?

26:09.542 --> 26:12.208
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking
about.

26:12.291 --> 26:14.500
Your brother said Jack went
off
to pay your ransom.

26:14.583 --> 26:17.500
You came home a few hours later
but he never did.

26:19.542 --> 26:21.083
Warren said that?

26:21.166 --> 26:24.208
He wants to help us
find out what happened to
Jack.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.041
Listen, maybe I went
missing a few hours

26:35.125 --> 26:36.792
but I don't remember specifics.

26:36.875 --> 26:39.166
Anything you saw or heard
could be helpful.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.959
I was six years old.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.500
I'm sorry, may I have my phone
back now?

26:43.583 --> 26:46.834
When I was five
I was playing outside.

26:46.917 --> 26:49.333
Neighbor's father
had a heart attack

26:49.417 --> 26:50.834
right in front of me.

26:50.917 --> 26:54.000
I remember the sound
when his head hit pavement.

26:54.083 --> 26:57.834
I can still see his mail
blowing into the street.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.458
I remember everything.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.166
I was five.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.000
Jack saved your life.

27:04.083 --> 27:07.792
(Will)
Don't you think you owe him
anything for that?

27:09.792 --> 27:14.166
There was this...dripping pipe.

27:16.375 --> 27:18.750
I'll never forget that pipe.

27:28.792 --> 27:30.542
Cut it out, stupid.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.959
Don't hurt her.
I got the lucky money. $360.

27:39.041 --> 27:40.625
Hand it over.

27:40.709 --> 27:43.041
I'd be honored to give it
to Mr. Bo-Lin Chen myself.

27:43.125 --> 27:44.458
Just give it to me.

27:44.542 --> 27:46.583
Please, I just want to talk
to Mr. Bo-Lin Chen.

27:46.667 --> 27:49.250
- 'I'll cause no trouble.'
- Mr. Bo-Lin Chen, huh?

27:49.333 --> 27:50.959
Stand still.

27:59.417 --> 28:00.959
You're gonna get
your wish.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.959
Bo-Lin will be the last
person
you ever see.

28:04.041 --> 28:05.333
Let's go.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.792
Some guy brought me home.

28:14.875 --> 28:17.792
Spent the rest of my
life
trying to erase it.

28:17.875 --> 28:19.375
Do you know where you were?

28:19.458 --> 28:22.000
I think it was
underneath
the Shah-Lo
Restaurant.

28:22.083 --> 28:24.959
Saw a bunch of take-out
boxes
and stuff like that.

28:25.041 --> 28:26.917
But they took
him
somewhere else.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.250
To see Bo-Lin Chen.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.166
I don't know where.

28:32.375 --> 28:34.792
But I never saw Jack again.

28:39.166 --> 28:42.166
- What can I do for you,
Detec--
- You can sit down.

28:42.250 --> 28:43.500
Sure.

28:43.583 --> 28:47.625
You own the Shah-Lo Restaurant,
Mr. Chen?

28:47.709 --> 28:49.709
I have many
business
interests.

28:49.792 --> 28:51.417
Like kidnapping for ransom?

28:51.500 --> 28:52.750
Is this some kind of joke?

28:52.834 --> 28:55.500
In 1983 a little girl
was held against her will

28:55.583 --> 28:57.041
in the basement
of your restaurant.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.125
That never happened.

28:58.208 --> 28:59.750
Well, she remembers
it pretty good.

28:59.834 --> 29:02.417
- Knows your name.
- Lots of people know my name.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.792
If she saw me commit
such a horrible crime

29:04.875 --> 29:06.250
you should arrest me.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.041
No?

29:09.917 --> 29:12.000
I didn't think so.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.166
I'd like to
leave now.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.875
Take a seat.

29:17.041 --> 29:21.000
Just need to confirm the last
time you saw Jack Chao Lu.

29:21.083 --> 29:22.667
Already told the lieutenant.

29:22.750 --> 29:25.083
I want to help
your
investigation

29:25.166 --> 29:26.458
but I don't see how I can.

29:26.542 --> 29:28.208
Well, stop
jerking us around for one.

29:28.291 --> 29:30.667
(Lilly)
'What'd you call yourself
last time we talked?'

29:30.750 --> 29:32.500
Friend to the department?

29:32.583 --> 29:34.125
Yeah, that's a joke.

29:34.208 --> 29:36.709
I serve as a liaison.

29:36.792 --> 29:38.709
Long as the tourists are safe

29:38.792 --> 29:42.333
the police don't care
about the people in
Chinatown.

29:42.417 --> 29:43.500
Oh, and you do?

29:43.583 --> 29:45.500
They come to me
when they need
help.

29:45.583 --> 29:47.917
No, you threaten them
so they won't talk to us.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.750
Exploit them in sweatshops,
casinos, brothels.

29:50.834 --> 29:52.166
That all ends today.

29:52.250 --> 29:53.333
What are you talking about?

29:53.417 --> 29:54.709
Well we're shutting it all down.

29:54.792 --> 29:56.458
Not mine,
but what's the
point?

29:56.542 --> 29:58.208
You shut 'em down.
Other ones pop up.

29:58.291 --> 30:01.458
Maybe, but between now and then
you'll lose a lot of money.

30:06.667 --> 30:09.792
I tell you what I know,
you leave Chinatown
alone?

30:09.875 --> 30:12.208
August 12, 1983.

30:12.291 --> 30:13.834
Jack Chao Lu.

30:15.750 --> 30:17.959
Jack grew up in Chinatown

30:18.041 --> 30:20.667
but didn't understand
how it works.

30:20.750 --> 30:22.667
I just tried to put
some sense to him.

30:32.083 --> 30:34.208
Look, don't hurt Stacey Lee,
please, alright.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.583
I've got your money.

30:37.792 --> 30:40.208
There's been some
misunderstanding.

30:40.291 --> 30:43.750
But I appreciate this token
of your respect.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.333
What is this about?

30:51.417 --> 30:52.917
You cooperate with police?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.500
I know what you are.

30:56.458 --> 30:57.917
(Bo-Lin)
'I'm a businessman.'

30:58.000 --> 31:00.083
And friend of your father's.

31:00.166 --> 31:02.750
He'd be so ashamed
if he saw how you speak to me

31:02.834 --> 31:04.667
with such disrespect.

31:04.750 --> 31:06.750
Businessman, my ass.
You smile in our face.

31:06.834 --> 31:07.959
You stab us in the back.

31:08.041 --> 31:11.875
No, no, no.
You got it wrong, son.

31:11.959 --> 31:13.583
You want criminal?

31:13.667 --> 31:15.125
Look at your cop friend.

31:15.208 --> 31:18.667
He's too busy lining his pockets
with my money to arrest anyone.

31:18.750 --> 31:19.875
That's not true.

31:19.959 --> 31:22.041
You've got a lot to learn
about the world.

31:35.166 --> 31:37.208
Jack left angry,
but he was alive.

31:37.291 --> 31:38.458
Angry with you.

31:38.542 --> 31:40.125
With the police
department,
of course.

31:40.208 --> 31:42.667
- They let him down.
- You're the one who buys
cops.

31:42.750 --> 31:45.291
Well, it's not bribery
if the cop takes the
money.

31:45.375 --> 31:46.959
It's extortion.

31:47.041 --> 31:48.166
I'm the victim here.

31:48.250 --> 31:49.750
(Scotty)
'Yeah, well, file a
complaint.'

31:49.834 --> 31:51.917
- Give us the cop's name.
- 'I can't do that.'

31:52.000 --> 31:53.500
I'm being extorted.

31:53.583 --> 31:56.750
Afraid for my life and so on.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.959
You seem to be smart.

32:01.041 --> 32:03.083
You'll figure it out.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.250
Anything on Bianchi?

32:11.333 --> 32:13.333
Found some financial
discrepancies.

32:13.417 --> 32:15.625
All three of his kids
went to private
colleges.

32:15.709 --> 32:20.625
On full scholarships paid for by
dummy corporations, foundations.

32:20.709 --> 32:22.375
Traced back to the CTA.

32:22.458 --> 32:24.709
(Will)
'Maybe Jack
confronted Bianchi.'

32:24.792 --> 32:26.291
(Kat)
'Had a lot to lose.'

32:26.375 --> 32:28.458
Pension, for sure,
probably jail time.

32:29.583 --> 32:31.250
Get him in here.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.083
CTA scholarships were the tip
of the iceberg, Ray.

32:42.166 --> 32:44.417
We're going through your tax
returns and bank statements
now.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.208
I'm retired, John.

32:46.291 --> 32:48.625
You're gonna call the rat
squad
without even talking to me?

32:48.709 --> 32:50.709
They even think you got
a kid's murder on your hands.

32:50.792 --> 32:53.458
Bribery's the least
of your problems.

32:53.542 --> 32:55.166
You know me, 30 years.

32:55.250 --> 32:56.792
You gotta know
I've never hurt that kid.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.208
You gave his name
to Bo-Lin Chen.

32:58.291 --> 33:00.000
- What do you call that?
- No. No way.

33:00.083 --> 33:02.041
That kid didn't need no help
to get himself into trouble.

33:02.125 --> 33:03.333
I was in a tough spot.

33:03.417 --> 33:04.542
You put yourself in a tough spot

33:04.625 --> 33:05.875
when you took money from Bo-Lin.

33:05.959 --> 33:07.166
We make deals, John.

33:07.250 --> 33:08.709
It's how Chinatown works.

33:08.792 --> 33:11.333
We got to take the gifts, or
the tong won't even talk to
us.

33:11.417 --> 33:13.166
- Don't say we.
- Fine.

33:13.250 --> 33:16.792
I
the gang shoot-outs over turf.

33:16.875 --> 33:18.208
In exchange for what?

33:18.291 --> 33:20.333
Let him smuggle drugs,
run brothels and
casinos?

33:20.417 --> 33:22.125
What was I supposed to do?

33:22.208 --> 33:23.417
Let tourists get killed
while they're eatin'

33:23.500 --> 33:24.792
their sweet and sour chicken?

33:24.875 --> 33:27.625
Jack Lu reached out
to the department for help,
Ray.

33:27.709 --> 33:30.000
He went against
what
everybody told him

33:30.083 --> 33:31.083
and he trusted a cop.

33:31.166 --> 33:32.583
He trusted you.

33:33.583 --> 33:35.250
What do you want from me?

33:38.500 --> 33:40.458
Start with the truth.

33:43.208 --> 33:44.625
I can't give you Bo-Lin.

33:44.709 --> 33:46.625
(John)
'Do you have proof
that he's the doer?'

33:46.709 --> 33:48.959
(Ray)
'No. There's not gonna be
none.'

33:49.041 --> 33:51.625
He never got within a foot
of the really dirty work.

33:51.709 --> 33:53.667
Then it's on you.

33:58.542 --> 34:00.834
I couldn't protect that kid.

34:00.917 --> 34:04.083
He had his own set of
keys
to the flophouse.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.291
Hey, kid.

34:10.375 --> 34:13.083
What you doing here?
It ain't Thursday.

34:15.166 --> 34:17.959
- What's up?
- I just want to know one
thing.

34:18.875 --> 34:20.333
Do you know who killed Tam?

34:20.417 --> 34:22.875
- Have you known all along?
- Hey.

34:22.959 --> 34:25.458
- What's wrong?
- Answer my question.

34:26.625 --> 34:28.083
They were rival tongs.

34:28.166 --> 34:31.333
One shoots up the
other's
festival over turf.

34:31.417 --> 34:32.625
I..

34:32.709 --> 34:34.750
No, you got
to let it
go.

34:34.834 --> 34:36.625
That's why you're going after
the heroin smugglers, right?

34:36.709 --> 34:38.709
Bo-Lin Chen, so you can
stop
that kind of violence?

34:38.792 --> 34:41.333
Look, I told you
we're gonna get those guys

34:41.417 --> 34:43.125
but first, we got
to build a case.

34:43.208 --> 34:45.458
How you gonna do that when
Bo-Lin Chen is paying you

34:45.542 --> 34:47.417
to make sure
he doesn't get
arrested?

34:50.583 --> 34:52.834
Who told you that?

34:52.917 --> 34:56.000
No wonder everything's
so messed up around here.

34:56.083 --> 34:58.250
Good guys are the same
as the bad guys.

35:03.834 --> 35:05.875
Went in the room, and..

35:05.959 --> 35:09.000
...whole place was torn apart.

35:10.417 --> 35:12.208
Jack got the other tapes.

35:12.291 --> 35:14.458
What other tapes?

35:17.875 --> 35:21.125
I held back the ones
with Bo-Lin's voice on
them.

35:21.208 --> 35:22.792
'It was my insurance policy.'

35:22.875 --> 35:24.834
Jack...got 'em all.

35:24.917 --> 35:26.667
- And where are they now?
- Gone.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.333
Bo-Lin probably destroyed
them
when he took Jack out.

35:29.417 --> 35:31.458
You could have made a case
against Bo-Lin

35:31.542 --> 35:33.375
with everything
you saw and did, Ray.

35:33.458 --> 35:34.667
It doesn't matter.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.417
It's the tong.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.834
You, you cut off one head of the
dragon the other one grows back.

35:39.917 --> 35:42.375
Then you go after that one, and
you go after the one after that.

35:42.458 --> 35:44.208
You get the guy
that did the crime, Ray.

35:44.291 --> 35:45.917
That's the job.

35:54.375 --> 35:56.500
I'm gonna need that phone now.

35:57.291 --> 35:59.041
Call my delegate.

35:59.125 --> 36:02.291
You might want
to call your wife first.

36:10.625 --> 36:12.959
If Jack went back to Bo-Lin

36:13.041 --> 36:15.083
he'd destroy those tapes.

36:15.166 --> 36:16.834
Not to mention Jack.

36:18.417 --> 36:20.667
Unless the kid
got smarter than that.

36:41.542 --> 36:42.667
I can't listen anymore.

36:42.750 --> 36:44.959
It's important
you ID the voices.

36:45.041 --> 36:48.333
Please don't
ask
me to do this.

36:52.333 --> 36:54.041
Mrs. Lu.

36:56.208 --> 36:59.291
Your son Jack
was very brave.

36:59.375 --> 37:01.125
'Honorable.'

37:02.542 --> 37:04.458
He deserves better.

37:04.542 --> 37:06.041
Justice.

37:07.375 --> 37:09.583
One of them is Bo-Lin Chen.

37:10.417 --> 37:12.041
And the other voice?

37:12.709 --> 37:16.208
Ling...my eldest son

37:16.291 --> 37:18.875
selling his soul to the devil.

37:24.709 --> 37:27.500
Hong Sheng Long Market
has two trucks.

37:27.583 --> 37:30.500
Can easily move shipments
without being stopped.

37:30.583 --> 37:32.542
What about your father?

37:32.625 --> 37:34.291
He's not the type
that can be
bought.

37:34.375 --> 37:36.166
Don't worry about him.

37:36.250 --> 37:38.542
He trusts what I say.

37:38.625 --> 37:40.333
He'll never know.

37:47.500 --> 37:50.000
(Bo-Lin on tape)
'Anything you need.'

37:50.083 --> 37:51.583
Hmm.

37:51.667 --> 37:52.875
I'm sorry, detectives.

37:52.959 --> 37:55.000
I don't recognize
either of the
voices.

37:55.083 --> 37:57.667
Oh, it's you...and Bo-Lin.

37:57.750 --> 37:59.166
No, no, you're mistaken.

37:59.250 --> 38:00.667
Your brother found this tape.

38:00.750 --> 38:02.166
Probably listened
to the whole thing.

38:02.250 --> 38:04.125
If I was him,
I'd be pretty
disappointed

38:04.208 --> 38:05.333
in my older brother.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.500
He was a naive little kid.

38:06.583 --> 38:08.000
Didn't know anything
about responsibility.

38:08.083 --> 38:10.250
He cared about
doing
the right thing.

38:11.417 --> 38:12.750
Doesn't count
in your book?

38:12.834 --> 38:14.959
Jack just cared about himself.

38:15.041 --> 38:17.291
In our culture, we honor
and protect our family

38:17.375 --> 38:18.500
above all else.

38:18.583 --> 38:20.959
Think your mother felt
the same way.

38:22.959 --> 38:24.333
Excuse me?

38:24.417 --> 38:28.250
Well, you said that you weren't
on the tape, but she heard it.

38:28.333 --> 38:29.625
- Told us herself.
- No.

38:29.709 --> 38:32.000
I think a mother
recognizes her own son.

38:35.417 --> 38:37.000
Is she here?

38:39.709 --> 38:41.917
N-no, she's gone home.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.792
But she did want us
to give you this.

38:52.834 --> 38:54.917
What's it say?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.583
"You have brought shame

38:56.667 --> 38:57.792
"to your father

38:58.959 --> 39:00.667
"and to our family name."

39:04.458 --> 39:07.000
That's why you had to stop Jack.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.625
[sobbing]
He never understood.

39:10.917 --> 39:12.250
He never understood.

39:12.333 --> 39:14.208
Never understood.

39:22.875 --> 39:24.000
What are you doing here?

39:24.083 --> 39:26.041
You're using dad's trucks
to ship heroin.

39:26.125 --> 39:28.250
I know when and where.

39:28.333 --> 39:31.291
I'm just making a
little
extra money for the
store.

39:31.375 --> 39:32.834
So dad knows?

39:32.917 --> 39:35.959
We already pay hundreds of
dollars a week to those
punks.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.417
Why shouldn't we get
a piece of the pie?

39:37.500 --> 39:39.291
Because they're lowlife
criminals, and we're not.

39:39.375 --> 39:41.458
Bo-Lin Chen asked for my help

39:41.542 --> 39:43.208
and is very
generous
in exchange.

39:43.291 --> 39:45.417
I can't believe you'd touch
money from his pockets.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.291
You're a
ridiculous
little child.

39:47.375 --> 39:48.750
I'd be a sucker
if I didn't take

39:48.834 --> 39:50.917
an opportunity handed
to me on a silver
platter.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.667
So, dad's a sucker?

39:55.041 --> 39:57.625
He's very traditional and
there's no point getting

39:57.709 --> 40:00.000
him confused
with more business
affairs.

40:00.083 --> 40:02.166
- I'm taking over the store.
- Not yet, you're not.

40:02.250 --> 40:03.458
Just leave this alone.

40:03.542 --> 40:04.917
Everybody around here wants
to leave it alone.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.291
That's why nothing ever changes.

40:06.375 --> 40:07.583
What do you want
to change, Jack?

40:07.667 --> 40:09.333
Your buddy Bo-Lin
ordered the Dragon Boys

40:09.417 --> 40:11.709
to shoot up
the summer festival.

40:11.792 --> 40:15.125
He didn't care who got hurt.
I'm going to make him care.

40:15.208 --> 40:16.959
You've lost your
mind,
little brother.

40:17.041 --> 40:18.667
Not me, Ling.

40:19.709 --> 40:21.834
They killed my Tam,
and I got proof.

40:24.583 --> 40:27.250
Where are you going? Wait.

40:27.333 --> 40:30.250
Jack, you're not going to
tell dad about the truck?

40:30.333 --> 40:32.834
You did this to yourself.

40:32.917 --> 40:35.041
He'll disown me.
You know that.

40:35.125 --> 40:36.834
You're not my brother.

40:40.667 --> 40:42.000
Stop!

40:43.333 --> 40:44.750
Jack!

40:45.875 --> 40:47.166
Stop!

40:48.917 --> 40:50.166
Jack!

43:40.542 --> 43:41.750
