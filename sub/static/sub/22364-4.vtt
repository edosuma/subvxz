WEBVTT

00:02.759 --> 00:07.791
The seven wonders of the world...
Christ the redeemer.

00:08.634 --> 00:11.035
The Taj Mahal.

00:11.103 --> 00:13.504
The great pyramids.

00:13.572 --> 00:17.141
Truly man's greatest achievements.

00:17.209 --> 00:20.044
But there's one man who
sees them differently.

00:20.112 --> 00:22.680
A building like that should be
going, "What's been going on?"

00:26.251 --> 00:28.686
Karl Pilkington.

00:28.754 --> 00:30.722
I don't know the
politically correct term.

00:30.789 --> 00:32.189
Close your mouth.

00:32.256 --> 00:33.458
Moron.

00:33.525 --> 00:38.763
I think he is a round,
empty-headed, chimp-like moron.

00:38.831 --> 00:39.664
And he's a friend.

00:39.732 --> 00:40.665
You're not meant to laugh.

00:40.733 --> 00:42.467
You're meant to go, "Ooh."

00:42.534 --> 00:44.569
He's a typical little englander,
and he doesn't like

00:44.637 --> 00:45.703
going out of his comfort zone.

00:47.306 --> 00:51.309
I just think that it'd be amazing
to send him around the world.

00:51.377 --> 00:53.678
Me eyes have never been so busy.

00:53.746 --> 00:55.613
There's always something
there going, "Look at me."

00:55.681 --> 00:57.715
So you're like that so your neck...
By the end of today,

00:57.783 --> 00:59.417
me neck will be well
and truly worn out.

00:59.485 --> 01:04.489
What we'd like to see is him experience
other cultures...

01:04.556 --> 01:08.660
...And see if in any way we can
change his outlook on the world.

01:08.727 --> 01:12.630
It's like something make an ornament
of sort of next to the telly.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.298
I've been to many exotic places.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.234
I genuinely think travel
broadens the mind.

01:16.301 --> 01:17.735
I want him to hate it.

01:17.803 --> 01:18.169
Oh.

01:18.237 --> 01:21.205
I want him to hate every minute
of it for my own amusement.

01:22.574 --> 01:27.078
Nothing is funnier than Karl in
a corner being poked by stick.

01:27.146 --> 01:28.264
I am that stick.

01:28.534 --> 01:31.634
And now I have the might
of sky behind me.

01:31.942 --> 01:34.381
Shit! Shit!

01:34.401 --> 01:36.695
This is one of the funniest, most
expensive practical jokes I've ever done.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.133
And it's gonna be great.

01:40.472 --> 01:42.891
Just let me go! Jesus.
No.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.280
Next up, Karl...

01:49.400 --> 01:51.434
Chichen Itza in Mexico.

01:51.502 --> 01:52.802
Never heard of it.

01:52.870 --> 01:56.439
No, I know you'll think it
looks a little like a pyramid.

01:56.507 --> 01:57.774
Yeah.

01:57.841 --> 02:00.543
Not just about the
building, though, is it?

02:00.611 --> 02:03.346
Mexico very different to Egypt.

02:03.414 --> 02:07.950
Completely different country on a different
continent thousands of miles away.

02:08.018 --> 02:11.688
Used, of course, for human
sacrifice back in the day.

02:11.755 --> 02:13.356
Yeah, the death thing is good.

02:13.424 --> 02:13.990
Right.

02:14.058 --> 02:18.761
So as opposed to celebrating life and
culture, you want to go around...

02:18.829 --> 02:20.797
Well, it's more relevant
to me than this, isn't it?

02:20.864 --> 02:21.998
A pyramid isn't for me, is it?

02:22.066 --> 02:23.966
I'm not gonna use a pyramid,
but I am gonna die.

02:24.034 --> 02:25.101
But it's not about death.

02:25.169 --> 02:27.503
And the great thing is, Karl,
that in a lot of these

02:27.571 --> 02:29.372
countries, it's a very
high murder rate.

02:29.440 --> 02:29.772
Yeah.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.475
So there's a strong chance that you're
one of the group could get killed.

02:32.543 --> 02:35.878
If you've got a building for it...
It's equivalent of, like,

02:35.946 --> 02:39.716
death hill in that if you've got
something cold, dark in an area,

02:39.783 --> 02:40.516
it encourages it.

02:40.584 --> 02:42.518
Knock it down and say,
"Don't do that anymore.

02:42.586 --> 02:43.052
It's bad."

02:45.756 --> 02:46.622
Well, there you go.

02:46.690 --> 02:47.557
Knock it down.

02:47.624 --> 02:49.125
Well, anyway, you're going.

02:49.193 --> 02:50.293
Get your bags, your passport.

02:50.360 --> 02:54.263
We've got to get you
to the airport.

02:54.331 --> 02:55.865
Packing again.

02:55.933 --> 03:00.470
Um... This time for Mexico.

03:00.537 --> 03:02.572
I mean, it's the same
clothes, really.

03:02.639 --> 03:03.840
It doesn't matter where I'm going.

03:03.907 --> 03:05.675
I've got the same pants,
I've got the same t-shirts.

03:05.743 --> 03:08.311
Um, maybe a different
flavor crisps.

03:08.378 --> 03:09.812
What crisps have you got?

03:09.880 --> 03:12.281
Uh, monster munch pickled onion.

03:12.349 --> 03:14.484
Uh, it's good, soft
things like this.

03:14.551 --> 03:17.153
What do you like in
that monster munch?

03:17.221 --> 03:20.289
It's just a bit... there's something
about them that cheers you up.

03:20.357 --> 03:23.126
Not only are they tasty...
You're just having a little

03:23.193 --> 03:26.162
monster talk out
when you're fed up.

<i>Hey, Karl.</i>

04:04.568 --> 04:05.735
<i>How are you doing?</i>

04:05.803 --> 04:06.302
<i>Karlos?</i>

04:06.370 --> 04:07.336
<i>How are you doing, man?</i>

04:07.404 --> 04:08.404
<i>I'm all right, yeah.</i>

04:08.472 --> 04:09.372
<i>Call me Karlos, yeah.</i>

04:09.439 --> 04:10.206
<i>That's all right.</i>

04:10.274 --> 04:11.040
<i>Let's go, man.</i>

04:11.108 --> 04:12.241
<i>What's up in there, huh?</i>

04:12.309 --> 04:13.209
<i>What's all this?</i>

04:13.277 --> 04:15.178
<i>Some [Bleep] Crashed me, man.</i>

04:15.245 --> 04:16.745
<i>Some [Bleep] Crashed you.</i>

04:16.814 --> 04:17.579
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:17.648 --> 04:19.382
<i>Is this yours? Huh? This dog?</i>

04:19.449 --> 04:20.016
<i>Yes.</i>

04:20.083 --> 04:20.882
<i>That's yours?</i>

04:20.951 --> 04:22.017
<i>Yeah, this is Jack.</i>

04:22.719 --> 04:24.353
<i>Oh.</i>

04:24.421 --> 04:26.455
<i>Normal.</i>

04:26.523 --> 04:27.723
<i>Is this a little chihuahua?</i>

04:27.791 --> 04:28.457
<i>Yes.</i>

04:29.827 --> 04:30.426
<i>Oh.</i>

04:34.631 --> 04:35.865
<i>Que pasa, Jack.</i>

04:35.933 --> 04:38.601
<i>When you first get them,
they're tiny, aren't they?</i>

04:38.669 --> 04:39.235
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

04:39.303 --> 04:43.773
<i>And a friend of me mum had one,
sat on the sea front... yeah.</i>

04:43.841 --> 04:45.842
<i>A seagull came down, took it away.</i>

04:45.909 --> 04:46.509
<i>Uh-huh?</i>

04:46.577 --> 04:47.677
<i>A seagull... bird.</i>

04:47.744 --> 04:48.211
<i>Yes.</i>

04:48.278 --> 04:52.048
<i>Came down, grabbed it, took it
out to see, never saw it again.</i>

04:52.115 --> 04:52.648
<i>No</i>

04:52.716 --> 04:54.884
<i>No</i>

04:54.952 --> 04:56.552
<i>, man.</i>

04:56.620 --> 04:57.720
<i>I know.</i>

04:57.788 --> 05:03.326
<i>Today is the day of the...
Jesus Christ die.</i>

05:03.393 --> 05:05.361
<i>Let me show you the celebration.</i>

05:05.429 --> 05:09.532
<i>It's a good celebration, man...
With a lot of romance and</i>

05:09.600 --> 05:12.902
<i>Mexican womans and...
Well, quite funny, man.</i>

05:12.970 --> 05:14.704
<i>I've got a girlfriend.</i>

05:14.771 --> 05:15.705
<i>Nice bod?</i>

05:15.772 --> 05:16.505
<i>What?</i>

05:16.573 --> 05:17.506
<i>Nice bod?</i>

05:17.574 --> 05:18.241
<i>Smart?</i>

05:18.308 --> 05:19.208
<i>Nice bod?</i>

05:19.276 --> 05:20.243
<i>Nice body?</i>

05:20.310 --> 05:21.010
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:21.078 --> 05:22.445
<i>She used to have.</i>

05:22.512 --> 05:23.179
<i>Yeah?</i>

05:23.247 --> 05:25.281
<i>But, you know, I'm
not having a go.</i>

05:25.349 --> 05:26.949
<i>I used to look better than this.</i>

05:27.017 --> 05:30.419
<i>So I just think, you know, we both
sort of lost out a little bit.</i>

05:30.487 --> 05:31.320
<i>Good</i>

05:31.388 --> 05:32.455
<i>Um...</i>

05:32.522 --> 05:33.623
<i>Yeah, they're fine.</i>

05:33.690 --> 05:35.091
<i>I mean... it's okay.</i>

05:36.093 --> 05:39.228
<i>I mean, you know, I've never...
It's good to have a good... </i>

05:39.296 --> 05:40.763
<i>A good body, you know?</i>

05:40.831 --> 05:41.430
<i>Ohh.</i>

05:41.498 --> 05:42.531
<i>Okay, Karlitos.</i>

05:42.599 --> 05:46.335
<i>You want to take this street, you
know, along the stone quarries.</i>

05:46.403 --> 05:47.136
<i>This one here?</i>

05:47.204 --> 05:50.306
<i>Yeah, the big celebration
is over there.</i>

05:50.374 --> 05:51.107
<i>See you later, Edgar.</i>

05:51.174 --> 05:52.108
<i>Ciao.</i>

06:00.817 --> 06:03.319
<i>It seems to be a big deal here... easter,
whereas at home,</i>

06:03.387 --> 06:05.721
<i>it's just... you know, "Sir,
sir, do you have a chocolate</i>

06:05.789 --> 06:07.056
<i>egg?," and he was like, "What?"</i>

06:07.124 --> 06:08.157
<i>He had no idea.</i>

06:08.225 --> 06:10.059
<i>They don't have
chocolate eggs here.</i>

06:10.127 --> 06:12.595
<i>I mean, for me, that's
what easter is.</i>

06:12.663 --> 06:14.430
<i>Take the eggs away, it's...
You know, what I mean?</i>

06:14.498 --> 06:17.633
<i>It's Friday.</i>

06:29.446 --> 06:31.847
<i>He fell over.</i>

06:31.915 --> 06:33.816
<i>I think it's part of the story.</i>

06:33.884 --> 06:36.185
<i>Somebody help him.</i>

06:36.253 --> 06:37.453
<i>Do you know the Bible story?</i>

06:37.521 --> 06:39.989
<i>No, I don't know, but surely he
wouldn't want someone helping</i>

06:40.057 --> 06:40.656
<i>him, would he?</i>

06:40.724 --> 06:41.924
<i>That's like saying, "Come on.</i>

06:41.992 --> 06:43.492
<i>I want to see you get crucified."</i>

06:43.560 --> 06:44.427
<i>Say, "Put it down.</i>

06:44.494 --> 06:45.461
<i>Don't be helping me."</i>

06:45.529 --> 06:48.097
<i>It's the one time in your life
where you don't want help.</i>

06:51.668 --> 06:52.668
<i>They're coming through.</i>

06:52.736 --> 06:53.602
<i>He's got a rush job.</i>

07:04.314 --> 07:06.048
<i>Just what you want, isn't it?</i>

07:06.116 --> 07:07.883
<i>Imagine that.</i>

07:07.951 --> 07:08.918
<i>Jesus being taken.</i>

07:08.986 --> 07:12.288
<i>You know, your life's gonna end,
you got someone with a recorder.</i>

07:13.190 --> 07:14.657
<i>It's the worst sound
going, isn't it?</i>

07:14.725 --> 07:16.258
<i>It's the worst instrument, that.</i>

07:16.326 --> 07:17.393
<i>I'd say, "Do it here."</i>

07:18.729 --> 07:19.428
<i>Bloody hell.</i>

07:30.913 --> 07:32.881
<i>I thought it was a proper
accident before when he was</i>

07:32.948 --> 07:35.984
<i>walking up and he fell over.</i>

07:36.051 --> 07:37.585
<i>I thought it was a proper
trip, and it was.</i>

07:37.653 --> 07:40.321
<i>He's obviously... he's leg locked.</i>

07:40.389 --> 07:43.057
<i>But it does sort of ruin the
whole sort of Jesus-type</i>

07:43.125 --> 07:46.027
<i>image when, you know, someone from St.
John's ambulance is</i>

07:46.095 --> 07:49.197
<i>sticking salve on his knee.</i>

07:49.265 --> 07:52.934
<i>You think they're gonna nail him?</i>

07:53.002 --> 07:53.735
<i>Not after.</i>

07:53.803 --> 07:56.738
<i>Because they were so concerned
about his knee, putting salve</i>

07:56.806 --> 07:57.772
<i>on and stuff on it.</i>

07:57.840 --> 07:59.974
<i>I don't they'd do that and say,
"All right, give us your hands."</i>

08:00.843 --> 08:02.877
<i>It'd be a bit, uh... be a
bit extreme, wouldn't it?</i>

08:02.945 --> 08:03.778
<i>They used to do it.</i>

08:03.846 --> 08:06.281
<i>Until 1984, they used
to do it with nails.</i>

08:06.348 --> 08:06.915
<i>Here?</i>

08:06.982 --> 08:07.615
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:07.683 --> 08:09.918
<i>Well, what sort of a nail
do you use for that?</i>

08:09.985 --> 08:11.553
<i>I always struggle.</i>

08:11.620 --> 08:12.020
<i>D.I.Y.</i>

08:12.087 --> 08:14.055
<i>You just never... you
never get it right.</i>

08:14.123 --> 08:20.128
<i>I do not know what sort
would go through... oh.</i>

08:32.408 --> 08:35.610
<i>Obviously, you know, all of this
means a lot to these people,</i>

08:35.678 --> 08:36.544
<i>doesn't it?</i>

08:36.611 --> 08:38.813
<i>Whereas, I've never seen
anything like this at home,</i>

08:38.881 --> 08:40.048
<i>you know... at home, really.</i>

08:40.115 --> 08:42.650
<i>It's a sort of a... it's got
religion linked to it, but,</i>

08:42.717 --> 08:45.386
<i>really, it's just the time of
the year for greedy people to</i>

08:45.454 --> 08:47.188
<i>feel like they're
doing a bit of good.</i>

08:47.256 --> 08:48.590
<i>"Oh, I love Jesus, mate.</i>

08:48.657 --> 08:49.557
<i>You got any eggs?"</i>

08:49.625 --> 08:50.925
<i>There wasn't an egg
even involved in it.</i>

08:50.993 --> 08:53.695
<i>I don't know the connection
between Jesus and an egg.</i>

08:53.762 --> 08:55.496
<i>'Cause he can't be happy
with that, can he?</i>

08:55.564 --> 08:57.665
<i>If he was his cross on his last
breath and someone said, "We're</i>

08:57.733 --> 08:58.633
<i>gonna remember you, Jesus."</i>

08:58.701 --> 08:59.534
<i>And it was like, "Great.</i>

08:59.602 --> 09:00.368
<i>What are you gonna do?"</i>

09:00.436 --> 09:01.269
<i>"We're gonna have egg."</i>

09:01.337 --> 09:01.803
<i>"What? Ugh."</i>

09:01.871 --> 09:02.737
<i>Do you know what I mean?</i>

09:02.805 --> 09:04.138
<i>You wouldn't be chuffed with that.</i>

09:07.042 --> 09:09.510
<i>It's not like this at
home, is it... easter?</i>

09:09.578 --> 09:12.347
<i>You know, my easter weekend,
I'm normally stuck watching</i>

09:12.414 --> 09:15.516
<i>James Bond or, you know, just
nipping out... stuff like</i>

09:15.584 --> 09:18.987
<i>that, but...
Somehow I can't see that</i>

09:18.988 --> 09:20.989
<i>somehow I can't see that</i>
<i>happening here.</i>

09:25.263 --> 09:28.832
Since I've been here, you know, I've sort
of been thinking about things that I

09:28.899 --> 09:31.101
know about Mexico, which isn't
that much, but then I just

09:31.168 --> 09:34.471
remember seeing a Mexican
jumping bean on "Sesame Street"

09:34.538 --> 09:35.605
when I was a kid.

09:35.673 --> 09:38.942
Mexican jumping beans.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.111
What are you laughing at?

09:41.178 --> 09:43.446
I told me mum about them, and she
was like, "What are you on about?"

09:43.514 --> 09:44.948
She ended up buying me
some marbles instead.

09:45.016 --> 09:47.584
I've always wanted to
see one in real life.

09:47.652 --> 09:49.185
Mexican jumping beans.

09:49.253 --> 09:51.154
Mexican jumping beans.

09:51.222 --> 09:52.656
Have you heard of them?

09:52.723 --> 09:53.189
No.

09:53.257 --> 09:55.625
It's like a bean...
and it jumps about.

09:55.693 --> 09:56.660
Bump-bump, bump-ba-bump.

09:56.727 --> 09:58.428
I don't know if you're
meant to eat them.

09:58.496 --> 10:00.563
I don't know if you get them
in a food shop or pet shop.

10:00.631 --> 10:02.098
Like a little bean,
pop it in your hand.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.267
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

10:04.335 --> 10:05.902
Probably be like Heinz beans.

10:05.970 --> 10:08.972
You can get them anywhere at home.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.074
Know Heinz beans?

10:11.142 --> 10:12.342
You got no brakes.

10:12.410 --> 10:12.776
Sí.

10:12.843 --> 10:13.810
How do you brake?

10:13.878 --> 10:14.644
Sí.

10:14.712 --> 10:15.779
Shhh! Brake.

10:15.846 --> 10:16.346
Sí.

10:16.414 --> 10:16.946
How?

10:17.014 --> 10:20.116
Sí.

10:20.184 --> 10:20.684
No brake.

10:20.751 --> 10:21.051
Sí.

10:21.118 --> 10:22.085
You might be Mexicans.

10:22.153 --> 10:23.386
You need brakes it's not safe.

10:24.555 --> 10:24.888
Sí.

10:24.955 --> 10:25.355
Brake.

10:26.524 --> 10:28.258
Oh.

10:40.338 --> 10:43.239
No, I didn't pack
anything like that, no.

10:50.815 --> 10:52.749
Wrestling?

10:52.817 --> 10:55.385
What's that got to do
with the seven wonders?

10:55.453 --> 10:57.320
I'm here to see a wonder.

11:12.803 --> 11:13.903
I've had enough practice.

11:13.971 --> 11:14.738
I mean, you know.

11:14.805 --> 11:20.844
You've sort of had me in that lock, so...
I know.

11:23.848 --> 11:25.115
That's the spirit.

11:25.182 --> 11:26.316
That's the spirit.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.620
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

11:30.688 --> 11:31.488
I'll see you later.

11:31.555 --> 11:32.922
All right.

11:38.129 --> 11:38.828
Oh, yeah.

11:38.896 --> 11:39.896
Are you Sandy?

11:39.964 --> 11:41.865
Hello.

11:41.932 --> 11:42.599
Bloody hell.

11:42.666 --> 11:44.501
I'm not doing it in
front of a crowd, am I?

11:44.568 --> 11:45.802
I'm just getting some training?

11:45.870 --> 11:49.272
Yeah, some training. Yeah.

11:50.608 --> 11:51.808
It's good, isn't it?

11:51.876 --> 11:55.445
I'm just about to go and
wrestle with the shocker.

11:55.513 --> 11:57.046
I told Susan about it, right?

11:57.114 --> 11:58.581
I said, "Don't be hassling me.

11:58.649 --> 11:59.983
I'm about to go wrestling."

12:00.050 --> 12:02.018
She sent me a text, "Be careful.

12:02.086 --> 12:04.254
How do you use the DVD player?"

12:04.321 --> 12:05.422
That's... that's good, isn't it?

12:05.489 --> 12:07.290
She's not that worried.

12:07.358 --> 12:08.057
Hey!

12:08.125 --> 12:10.126
I should introduce you.

12:10.194 --> 12:11.494
Nice to meet you, Karlitos.

12:11.562 --> 12:11.995
Karl.

12:12.062 --> 12:12.996
How are you doing?

12:13.063 --> 12:14.397
You're shocker.

12:14.465 --> 12:15.832
I'm shocker.

12:15.900 --> 12:16.766
Very pleased to meet you.

12:16.834 --> 12:17.667
Let me show you around.

12:17.735 --> 12:19.202
You're a lot bigger
than I thought.

12:19.270 --> 12:22.105
I thought they would have given me
a little fellow to sort of try out with.

12:22.173 --> 12:23.807
Oh, you want a little fellow?

12:23.874 --> 12:24.841
How big? This big?

12:24.909 --> 12:26.009
Just about like that.

12:26.777 --> 12:28.711
Come here, boy.

12:28.779 --> 12:29.846
Watch.

12:29.914 --> 12:31.981
Ugh!

12:32.049 --> 12:34.017
Ughh!

12:34.084 --> 12:35.084
Ugh!

12:35.152 --> 12:36.553
Aah!

12:36.620 --> 12:38.288
Ohh!

12:38.355 --> 12:41.191
Ugh!

12:41.258 --> 12:44.360
I know it's Ricky that set it up,
and it's folly, you know,

12:44.428 --> 12:46.896
to him, but this is, like,
how accidents happen.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.567
It's like the star of casualty.

12:48.857 --> 12:50.691
You watch that programme,
everyone's having fun,

12:50.926 --> 12:53.897
it's a party or something.
People are going on a holiday on a bus.

12:54.017 --> 12:55.582
And you know it's all gonna go wrong.

12:55.702 --> 12:57.230
And that's how this feels.

12:57.350 --> 12:59.505
It feels like the star of casualty.

13:00.019 --> 13:01.441
It was just somebody who chokes around.

13:01.561 --> 13:02.792
That could be me out there.

13:04.435 --> 13:07.604
I mean, does he know the full story
that I'm here to see the seven wonders?

13:07.672 --> 13:11.107
I didn't come here to be trained as a...
No, he doesn't know that.

13:11.175 --> 13:16.279
Yeah, well, it's...
You should tell him, really.

13:16.347 --> 13:17.647
Looks better on you.

13:17.715 --> 13:19.816
Wow.

13:19.884 --> 13:21.818
You look just like a wrestler.

13:26.057 --> 13:26.957
Hey, come on.

13:27.024 --> 13:29.459
Squat and then jump, kick your legs...
Go like that?

13:29.527 --> 13:30.327
Yeah, go ahead.

13:30.394 --> 13:31.461
That's all right.

13:31.529 --> 13:32.862
Whoa!

13:32.930 --> 13:33.797
Good job!

13:33.864 --> 13:35.131
Really?

13:35.199 --> 13:36.132
You almost got it.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.468
Okay, we're gonna start
with training of wrestling.

13:38.536 --> 13:39.469
Are you ready?

13:39.537 --> 13:40.770
Now what have I done there?

13:41.539 --> 13:43.106
You'll be okay
in a couple of days.

13:43.174 --> 13:43.573
Come on.

13:43.641 --> 13:43.940
Ready?

13:44.008 --> 13:46.009
You got to follow the lead, okay?

13:54.552 --> 13:55.852
There you go.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.988
See how easy that was?

14:07.164 --> 14:08.064
Okay?

14:08.132 --> 14:12.702
Can I be you in that one?

14:14.205 --> 14:16.139
Come on, you

14:22.146 --> 14:23.313
Oh, missed the thing.

14:27.952 --> 14:29.152
Go.

14:34.625 --> 14:35.892
Grab the ropes.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.461
Oh,

14:39.230 --> 14:40.063
Good job.

14:43.801 --> 14:44.300
Hold on.

14:44.368 --> 14:46.202
Don't just...
Oh, I'm going to be sick.

14:46.270 --> 14:47.837
Wait a minute.

14:47.905 --> 14:48.371
You're sick?

14:48.439 --> 14:48.905
I'm sick.

14:48.973 --> 14:49.706
Going to throw up?

14:49.774 --> 14:51.107
Like this.

14:51.175 --> 14:53.543
Is it normal to feel, like, sick?

14:53.611 --> 14:54.844
Ugh!

14:54.912 --> 14:56.379
Oh, yeah.

14:56.447 --> 14:57.213
Do you give up?

14:57.281 --> 14:58.281
Yeah.

14:59.784 --> 15:00.683
Ohh.

15:00.751 --> 15:02.852
Come on, Karl.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.020
Shocker, I can't.

15:04.088 --> 15:07.724
You see me shaking.

15:08.592 --> 15:12.295
That doesn't do me confidence
any good, really, because...

15:12.363 --> 15:14.531
I thought I was fitter than that.

15:14.598 --> 15:17.700
What do you think Suzanne
would say if she saw you now?

15:17.768 --> 15:19.002
I'm not wanting to watch this one.

15:19.070 --> 15:21.604
Whatever night this goes on, I'm gonna
take her out for something to eat.

15:21.672 --> 15:22.672
"I want to stay in and watch."

15:22.740 --> 15:25.175
"No, we're going out."

15:32.850 --> 15:36.653
Somebody said hang out, so, uh, I don't
know what I'm going to be doing.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.922
Rick and Steve probably
at home doing nothing.

15:38.989 --> 15:42.358
They haven't called up yet and
given any instructions, so I'm

15:42.426 --> 15:45.195
just gonna have a wander
about, see what's going on.

15:45.262 --> 15:46.096
Oh, look here.

15:46.163 --> 15:47.430
Look at the newspapers.

15:47.498 --> 15:50.567
Normally we've got Cheryl Cole
on the front of our newspapers.

15:50.634 --> 15:51.534
Yet, here, look.

15:51.602 --> 15:55.605
Fella sort of done in.

15:55.673 --> 15:59.275
Look at that.

16:03.981 --> 16:06.683
They're not scared of death
here in Mexico, are they?

16:06.750 --> 16:10.253
They're not worried about it.

16:10.321 --> 16:12.589
I mean, our graveyards don't
look like this, do they?

16:12.656 --> 16:14.824
This looks like they have
a holiday camp in a way with

16:14.892 --> 16:17.227
all the different colors and
everything... a little sort of

16:17.294 --> 16:20.730
beach like you get in Kent.

16:20.798 --> 16:27.837
Oh, this is the thing we're seeing,
isn't it... the Chichen... Chichen Itza.

16:27.905 --> 16:31.341
I mean, I've heard about
this day of the dead that they do.

16:31.408 --> 16:31.774
Yeah.

16:31.842 --> 16:35.645
Everyone basically has a party
to celebrate the dead people.

16:35.713 --> 16:36.779
We don't do that.

16:36.847 --> 16:39.282
We find it all a bit
morbid, don't we, death?

16:39.350 --> 16:40.850
We don't like to talk about it.

16:40.918 --> 16:43.853
Certainly don't have
a day dedicated to it.

16:43.921 --> 16:50.059
But then we waste days, you know,
dedicated to, like pancake Tuesday.

16:50.127 --> 16:56.566
Why have we got
a day for pancakes?

16:56.634 --> 16:59.002
This sort of thing,
me dad would do that.

16:59.069 --> 17:00.803
He built a barbecue
a bit like this.

17:00.871 --> 17:02.505
A little grill bit in there.

17:02.573 --> 17:04.473
That was a funnel.

17:09.887 --> 17:11.382
All right, mate.
How's it going?

17:13.290 --> 17:14.458
It's all right, you know.

17:14.526 --> 17:15.570
I'm not having a bad time here.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.782
Which is an odd thing to say
'cause it was wrestling yesterday.

17:20.232 --> 17:26.871
Um... it depends I mean, if he had hit
badly, I could come across like I'm weak.

17:26.938 --> 17:30.250
But, uh, I think I got
a few good moves in there.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.043
What do you mean?

17:44.923 --> 17:48.299
What do you mean they want... what
do you mean about the banning bit?

17:52.497 --> 17:54.999
I've been here now a couple of
days, and I've already seen

17:55.066 --> 17:57.735
that they're not really bothered
about health and safety.

17:57.802 --> 18:00.171
So the fact that there's
something that they are worried

18:00.238 --> 18:04.190
about the health and safety of means
that it must be pretty mental.

18:05.477 --> 18:09.313
I'm just waiting here for...
For Carlos, isn't it?

18:09.514 --> 18:11.515
Chicken with a gun.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.250
Hello, mate.

18:13.318 --> 18:13.851
Carlos.

18:13.919 --> 18:14.752
How are you doing?

18:14.819 --> 18:15.519
You all right?

18:15.587 --> 18:19.256
I'm glad, mate.

18:25.630 --> 18:27.698
What are they doing?

18:27.766 --> 18:32.937
That's a... it's kind of a...
A whistle we always do.

18:33.004 --> 18:35.539
No, I wasn't that shocked
with the whistle.

18:35.607 --> 18:38.209
It was the 30-foot frog
that they were carrying.

18:38.276 --> 18:39.476
Oh, yeah.

18:39.544 --> 18:41.111
It's called the Judas.

18:41.179 --> 18:46.350
We use things we don't
like and we burn them.

18:46.418 --> 18:49.653
They try to stop it because
it's a bit dangerous.

18:49.721 --> 18:52.523
What sort of...Danger?

18:52.591 --> 18:57.528
Uh... get an injury,
but not, like, death.

18:57.596 --> 19:00.331
But it's... there's a lot of injuries.

19:00.398 --> 19:01.432
Look.

19:01.499 --> 19:02.900
He's a master craftsman.

19:02.968 --> 19:03.567
Yeah?

19:03.635 --> 19:06.670
He makes fireworks.

19:06.738 --> 19:08.372
What, just on the
street like this?

19:08.440 --> 19:09.106
Yeah.

19:09.174 --> 19:09.974
Are these safe?

19:10.041 --> 19:10.474
Yeah.

19:10.542 --> 19:11.242
Look at him.

19:11.309 --> 19:12.943
Has he lost an eye
from doing this?

19:13.011 --> 19:13.544
Yeah.

19:13.612 --> 19:16.513
One of these fireworks, you
know, they turn on and then

19:16.581 --> 19:19.483
go. Like a
rocket, and they hit you.

19:19.551 --> 19:21.218
He got hit in the eye.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.786
Who's taking the
security measures?

19:22.854 --> 19:24.455
I haven't seen anyone
who looks official.

19:24.522 --> 19:27.825
I've seen a fellow with one eye who's
in charge of making the fireworks.

19:27.892 --> 19:32.029
Yeah, the... that's why the
government tried to ban it.

19:32.097 --> 19:35.299
But... but it would help the situation
if they just got a fellow with two eyes.

19:35.367 --> 19:36.233
Do you know what I mean?

19:36.301 --> 19:38.502
Maybe the government would say,
"Well, at least they're trying

19:38.570 --> 19:39.236
to make it safer."

19:39.304 --> 19:42.273
But I don't... I mean, respect
to the man for making a living

19:42.340 --> 19:46.176
out of it, but I don't think
he's the best man for the job.

19:53.551 --> 19:55.119
This is classico Torito.

19:55.186 --> 19:55.786
Yeah?

19:55.854 --> 19:58.622
This one is going to burn.

19:58.690 --> 19:59.456
Mental.

19:59.524 --> 20:00.624
It's not [Bleep] Mental.

20:00.692 --> 20:01.325
You'll see it.

20:01.393 --> 20:02.326
You'll enjoy it, mate.

20:02.394 --> 20:03.894
So all this is gunpowder, yeah?

20:03.962 --> 20:04.361
Yeah.

20:04.429 --> 20:05.596
I'm not getting under that.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.331
You're not getting
under that, mate.

20:10.101 --> 20:13.937
Well, Jamie's in charge of health and
safety, yet he's [Bleep] Back, you see.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.040
So I don't know what I'm
meant to be doing here.

20:16.107 --> 20:17.207
I'm meant to be over there?

20:17.275 --> 20:18.175
Is that a safe place?

20:18.243 --> 20:19.343
It's a safe place, mate.

20:19.411 --> 20:20.444
Let's go.

20:30.388 --> 20:31.388
Where are we going?!

20:31.456 --> 20:32.256
Behind the car!

20:32.324 --> 20:33.023
Behind the car!

20:33.091 --> 20:36.627
Quick! Behind the car!

20:36.695 --> 20:37.795
Whoo-hoo-hoo-ha!

20:37.862 --> 20:39.096
Get down! Get down!

20:39.164 --> 20:39.697
Get down, man!

20:46.137 --> 20:47.705
Whoo-hoo-hoo-ha!

20:50.375 --> 20:52.743
Whoo!

20:52.811 --> 20:53.410
Look, mate!

20:53.478 --> 20:53.844
What?

20:53.912 --> 20:55.412
I just got burned.

20:56.915 --> 20:58.082
Where are we going?

20:58.149 --> 20:59.550
Where's your house?

20:59.617 --> 21:01.552
House... it's over there.

21:01.619 --> 21:02.553
Let's go.

21:04.689 --> 21:04.955
Ohh!

21:05.023 --> 21:09.360
Down! Down that street!

21:09.427 --> 21:10.627
Whoo-hoo-hoo-ha!

21:10.695 --> 21:11.795
Come on, mate.

21:11.863 --> 21:12.563
Go on, man!

21:12.630 --> 21:14.431
Go on. I'll follow you.

21:19.504 --> 21:20.437
Where's Carlos?!

21:20.505 --> 21:21.872
Oh.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.040
Come on, mate.

21:23.108 --> 21:25.142
Get in.

21:25.677 --> 21:26.844
Whoo-hoo.

21:26.911 --> 21:27.845
Whoo!

21:31.316 --> 21:35.085
Well, what's this got
to do with Jesus?

21:35.153 --> 21:36.653
'Cause it's easter Sunday.

21:36.721 --> 21:37.187
Yeah.

21:37.255 --> 21:38.922
There's no hens going on.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.024
There's no chocolate eggs.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.927
I mean, I haven't read the
Bible, but I don't remember

21:43.995 --> 21:48.298
anyone mentioning setting fire to a
cow with a load of fireworks on it.

21:49.768 --> 21:55.406
The thing is, we burn things, and we think
that it's Judas iscariot, you know?

21:55.473 --> 21:57.307
It's like vengeance, you know?

21:57.375 --> 22:02.446
You betray Jesus Christ,
so you're going to burn.

22:02.514 --> 22:04.114
I wasn't getting that from that.

22:04.182 --> 22:06.650
I just saw lunatics.

22:10.989 --> 22:13.290
♪ Let's go work it out ♪

22:13.358 --> 22:15.225
Whoo-hoo!

22:18.363 --> 22:21.298
Steve sent me a text sort of
saying, "Right, you know, stop

22:21.366 --> 22:24.034
all your messing about,"
which has been out of order.

22:24.102 --> 22:27.704
He's the one who
sorted all this out.

22:27.772 --> 22:29.506
He said, "You know, you're
not there for messing about.

22:29.574 --> 22:32.743
You're meant to be
seeing the wonder."

22:32.811 --> 22:36.246
So I'm going to, uh, make my
way over that way today...

22:36.314 --> 22:39.082
Stop off on the way and
meet and meet some charros.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.484
Didn't know what they were.

22:40.552 --> 22:47.391
He said they're, uh,
Mexican cowboys.

22:47.459 --> 22:50.928
Ricky sort of said to Steve to
tell me to try a sombrero on.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.863
That was the ninth
thing he wanted.

22:52.931 --> 22:57.568
Not sort of broadening your mind of
meeting local people, trying local food.

22:57.635 --> 23:00.070
He just wants me to wear a hat.

23:00.138 --> 23:04.274
Close your mouth.

23:08.780 --> 23:09.813
Hey!

23:13.785 --> 23:16.987
It's not my sort of thing, really...
You know, cowboys and not.

23:17.055 --> 23:19.556
I've never been into it as a kid
or anything, but I'll have a look.

23:19.624 --> 23:21.892
Whoa.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.033
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:30.101 --> 23:31.802
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:35.740 --> 23:40.511
They're meant to be like proper
men, though, aren't they?

23:40.578 --> 23:43.413
If I went home, and he said, "Oh,
what are you doing these days?"

23:43.481 --> 23:44.615
"Oh, I've got into horses."

23:44.682 --> 23:46.817
They'd go, "What's... what's...
Is he an idiot."

23:47.352 --> 23:48.385
Do you know what I mean?

23:48.453 --> 23:50.454
It's not a very manly
thing to do at home.

23:50.522 --> 23:52.623
Turn! Turn!

23:53.892 --> 23:55.259
Turn!

23:55.326 --> 23:59.730
But for some reason when you think
of cowboys, you do think manliness.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.536
But I think maybe it's
losing it a little bit now.

24:05.603 --> 24:09.907
Maybe cowboys aren't like
that since... you know, since

24:09.974 --> 24:12.476
"Brokeback Mountain" and
the village people.

24:12.544 --> 24:14.878
There's been little things in
the way of cowboys, that's sort

24:14.946 --> 24:17.347
of ruining the
reputation a little bit.

24:17.415 --> 24:22.152
John Wayne... you know,
didn't he turn out to be gay?

24:23.656 --> 24:27.926
They will bring something to
toughen you up a little bit.

24:27.994 --> 24:29.527
And then you will ride the bull.

24:29.595 --> 24:30.495
I can't get on a bull.

24:30.563 --> 24:32.397
I shouldn't be getting on a bull.

24:32.465 --> 24:34.666
We've got loads of horses here
why are we messing about on an

24:34.734 --> 24:37.068
animal that you don't ride?

24:37.136 --> 24:40.505
They haven't got have
brains, have they?

24:40.573 --> 24:42.240
They'll just run riot.

24:45.144 --> 24:46.244
I don't want to do it.

24:46.312 --> 24:51.816
We'll have just a little
drink of tequila to smoothen

24:51.884 --> 24:56.888
your muscles and give you
a little bit of strength.

24:56.956 --> 25:01.926
One kind of tequila, they put
worms in it, and it's a very

25:01.994 --> 25:04.996
nice thing to offer the
worm to the guest.

25:05.064 --> 25:06.698
What is wrong with you people?

25:06.766 --> 25:08.133
May we split?

25:08.200 --> 25:11.536
Just [Bleep] About on
bulls, drinking worms.

25:11.604 --> 25:12.504
I've been wrestling.

25:12.571 --> 25:14.305
I've only been here
about three days.

25:14.373 --> 25:17.442
It's like everyone's daring each
other to do something stupid.

25:18.277 --> 25:19.677
Get on a cow, get on a bull.

25:19.745 --> 25:20.979
Yeah, let's have a wrestle.

25:21.047 --> 25:21.513
Eat a worm!

25:21.580 --> 25:22.514
Do you know what I mean?

25:22.581 --> 25:23.848
It's just it's never-ending.

25:23.916 --> 25:26.451
It's just...
Actually, for us, this is normal, man.

25:26.519 --> 25:29.587
I know, but that's
what's frightening.

25:31.657 --> 25:33.758
Do you chew or do
you just swallow?

25:33.826 --> 25:38.930
Of course you chew and you try to
figure out the flavor and everything.

25:38.998 --> 25:41.499
All right. There you go.

25:45.905 --> 25:48.106
Swallow it!

25:55.181 --> 25:57.682
It's still in there!

26:09.061 --> 26:10.328
Oh, gosh.

26:10.396 --> 26:11.396
Oh.

26:11.464 --> 26:13.298
Man.

26:13.365 --> 26:16.067
I daren't bend over
'cause I'm gonna be sick.

26:16.135 --> 26:17.569
Right, okay.

26:17.636 --> 26:18.636
Let's jump inside.

26:26.479 --> 26:28.012
Gracias.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.047
Can I see him?

26:31.951 --> 26:33.985
Eh, I've caught you
out, haven't I?

26:34.053 --> 26:36.821
Get him pissed off,
stick him on a bull.

26:36.889 --> 26:42.227
If anything happens, you just...
See, this isn't helping, Eugene.

26:42.294 --> 26:46.865
You know, seeing I've got to
suddenly jump out of the way.

26:47.766 --> 26:48.700
Look. Look, look, look.

26:51.770 --> 26:53.171
Hey, come on!

26:53.239 --> 26:54.472
I'm not going out there.

26:55.341 --> 26:56.174
No, seriously.

26:56.242 --> 26:57.008
Jamie, I can't.

26:57.076 --> 26:57.842
There's no way.

26:57.910 --> 26:58.943
Look.

26:59.011 --> 26:59.911
I can't!

26:59.979 --> 27:01.913
Keep it short.

27:03.082 --> 27:04.382
What's that he's got?

27:04.450 --> 27:07.352
It's for handling the...
Right. Exactly.

27:08.254 --> 27:09.687
No, no!

27:10.089 --> 27:10.622
Out of the way.

27:10.689 --> 27:10.889
Hey!

27:11.457 --> 27:13.725
No, no, no, no!

27:13.792 --> 27:14.893
No!

27:14.960 --> 27:15.827
Just let me go!

27:15.895 --> 27:16.294
No.

27:19.698 --> 27:21.399
Aah!

27:21.467 --> 27:21.933
What was that?

27:22.001 --> 27:23.935
Stop winding me up, now.

27:24.003 --> 27:25.403
Seriously, right?

27:25.471 --> 27:26.237
Enough's enough.

27:26.305 --> 27:27.005
Come on.

27:27.072 --> 27:30.508
Fuck no... no chance.

27:30.576 --> 27:31.576
Karl.
Forget it.

27:31.644 --> 27:33.978
Come back, man.
Karl.

27:34.046 --> 27:35.079
It's your turn.
No.

27:35.147 --> 27:36.548
Karl.
No, leave it.

27:36.615 --> 27:39.884
Seriously... I've ridden a horse,
I've had a drink, I've eaten a worm.

27:39.952 --> 27:40.952
Karl, come back.

27:41.020 --> 27:41.877
No.

27:45.191 --> 27:49.227
A lot of bees here.

27:49.295 --> 27:51.162
Is anywhere safe?

28:00.632 --> 28:04.167
Do you sell... do you sell
Mexican jumping beans?

28:04.235 --> 28:05.902
Mexican jumping beans?

28:05.970 --> 28:06.603
No.

28:06.671 --> 28:08.939
No?

28:09.007 --> 28:15.112
Do you know, uh...
Mexican jumping beans?

28:16.581 --> 28:17.347
No?

28:17.415 --> 28:19.349
I don't understand why
you've never heard of him.

28:19.417 --> 28:20.183
No.

28:20.251 --> 28:21.952
One of the best things
to come out of Mexico.

28:22.020 --> 28:23.453
Little bean.

28:25.690 --> 28:27.424
You all sit around
here, nothing to do.

28:27.492 --> 28:28.425
You'd love these things.

28:28.493 --> 28:33.363
Just pop them on the
floor, jump about.

28:33.431 --> 28:35.399
You seen that?

28:35.466 --> 28:37.100
What is it?

28:37.168 --> 28:40.203
It's the thing, isn't it?

28:40.271 --> 28:43.940
It's the, uh...
Chichen Itza that we're seeing.

28:44.008 --> 28:46.376
I mean, it's meant to be a place
that, you know, the used to

28:46.444 --> 28:49.980
sacrifice people and all that, but
they've stuck it on the plate.

28:50.815 --> 28:52.949
<i>You have one new message.</i>

29:10.368 --> 29:11.635
<i>Little change of plan there.</i>

29:11.703 --> 29:14.237
<i>I thought I was gonna be seeing
the wonder today, but Rick and</i>

29:14.305 --> 29:15.205
<i>Steve have called up.</i>

29:15.273 --> 29:16.640
<i>So forget that.</i>

29:16.841 --> 29:21.578
<i>Um, we're gonna be spending the
afternoon in a little village</i>

29:21.646 --> 29:23.280
<i>with some mayan people.</i>

29:23.348 --> 29:24.781
<i>So, it should be all right.</i>

29:24.849 --> 29:27.617
<i>You know, after all the hassle
on the... you know, the horses</i>

29:27.685 --> 29:30.020
<i>with the charros and that, it
should be a nice little relaxing</i>

29:30.088 --> 29:33.056
<i>afternoon, really.</i>

29:33.124 --> 29:33.623
<i>Luis?</i>

29:33.691 --> 29:34.391
<i>Hola!</i>

29:34.459 --> 29:35.459
<i>Eh, how you doing?</i>

29:35.526 --> 29:36.693
<i>Fine, thanks. And you?</i>

29:36.761 --> 29:37.361
<i>I'm Karl.</i>

29:37.428 --> 29:38.595
<i>Nice to meet you, Karl.</i>

29:38.663 --> 29:40.163
<i>Good to see you.</i>

29:40.231 --> 29:40.764
<i>Who's this?</i>

29:40.832 --> 29:41.865
<i>He's my Uncle... José.</i>

29:41.933 --> 29:43.100
<i>That's your Uncle... José.</i>

29:43.167 --> 29:43.900
<i>José.</i>

29:43.968 --> 29:44.501
<i>José.</i>

29:44.569 --> 29:45.736
<i>Nice to see you, José.</i>

29:45.803 --> 29:48.438
<i>The name of the small
village is Yashuna.</i>

29:48.506 --> 29:51.541
<i>Yashuna has around 500 people.</i>

29:51.609 --> 29:52.542
<i>It's a quiet place.</i>

29:52.610 --> 29:54.010
<i>It's not like a big city.</i>

29:54.078 --> 29:55.779
<i>Because we don't have a lot
of things to do here.</i>

29:55.847 --> 29:57.647
<i>No, there's nothing to do
here, is there, really.</i>

29:57.715 --> 29:58.749
<i>No, nothing.</i>

29:58.816 --> 30:02.352
<i>It's just working in the
cornfield, and then you go back</i>

30:02.420 --> 30:03.920
<i>to your home.</i>

30:06.758 --> 30:07.958
<i>Has he had a good day?</i>

30:08.025 --> 30:08.658
<i>Is he happy?</i>

30:08.726 --> 30:12.162
<i>Uh...</i>

30:12.230 --> 30:13.296
<i>Yes.</i>

30:13.364 --> 30:13.930
<i>He say yes.</i>

30:13.998 --> 30:16.166
<i>When did he last have a bad day?</i>

30:16.234 --> 30:20.370
<i>Uh...</i>

30:20.438 --> 30:20.737
<i>Never.</i>

30:20.805 --> 30:21.238
<i>Never.</i>

30:21.305 --> 30:22.205
<i>He's happy every day.</i>

30:22.273 --> 30:23.006
<i>He looks happy.</i>

30:23.074 --> 30:23.907
<i>He's got a happy face.</i>

30:23.975 --> 30:24.875
<i>Yeah, exactly. Yeah.</i>

30:24.942 --> 30:25.976
<i>He's constantly smiling.</i>

30:26.043 --> 30:27.077
<i>Everyone just stood around.</i>

30:27.145 --> 30:30.113
<i>Look, there's a fellow there just
playing with a bit of rubber.</i>

30:30.181 --> 30:33.250
<i>Now, what...
It can't be good for you, this, can it?</i>

30:33.317 --> 30:36.453
<i>That fellow who was smiling,
has he ever seen other life?</i>

30:36.521 --> 30:37.687
<i>Has ever been to, say...?</i>

30:37.755 --> 30:40.657
<i>No. Just here in this little
town, living here in the little</i>

30:40.725 --> 30:42.659
<i>house.</i>

30:42.727 --> 30:43.260
<i>But why?</i>

30:43.327 --> 30:45.562
<i>He doesn't know what he's
missing, though, does he?</i>

30:45.630 --> 30:50.200
<i>Anyway, he said, uh, "Let's go
knock down a wasp's nest."</i>

30:50.268 --> 30:51.401
<i>I said, "Do what?"</i>

30:51.469 --> 30:53.970
<i>He said, "Yeah, we knocked
down the wasp's nest and get</i>

30:54.038 --> 30:56.473
<i>all the, uh... get
the larva from it.</i>

30:56.541 --> 30:57.908
<i>What do you do with that?</i>

30:57.975 --> 31:00.477
<i>We eat it.</i>

31:00.545 --> 31:01.978
<i>Larva... wasp larva.</i>

31:02.046 --> 31:02.746
<i>Yes.</i>

31:02.814 --> 31:03.847
<i>You eat wasp larva?</i>

31:03.915 --> 31:04.381
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:04.449 --> 31:06.650
<i>There's the wasp nest.</i>

31:06.717 --> 31:07.284
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

31:08.219 --> 31:09.219
<i>Uh...</i>

31:09.287 --> 31:10.120
<i>Use that for wasps?</i>

31:11.823 --> 31:12.556
<i>They're all coming out.</i>

31:16.194 --> 31:18.128
<i>Oh!</i>

31:19.564 --> 31:20.530
<i>This is stupid.</i>

31:20.598 --> 31:23.133
<i>Seriously, how good could
a larva egg taste?</i>

31:23.201 --> 31:24.901
<i>Is it worth it?</i>

31:26.971 --> 31:31.942
<i>I got one in my...
Move your hand, move your hand.</i>

31:34.779 --> 31:36.379
<i>Oh!</i>

31:37.648 --> 31:39.015
<i>There it is.</i>

31:40.151 --> 31:44.020
<i>Ow.</i>

31:44.088 --> 31:45.388
<i>Don't run away, okay?</i>

31:45.456 --> 31:46.690
<i>Just look-it.</i>

31:46.757 --> 31:48.358
<i>No nothing.</i>

31:48.426 --> 31:51.895
<i>These little larvas... wasp
larvas, they still alive,</i>

31:51.963 --> 31:53.964
<i>and you can eat them like this.</i>

31:55.099 --> 31:56.967
<i>Went in their house... tiny place.</i>

31:57.034 --> 31:57.767
<i>Tight in here, isn't it?</i>

31:57.835 --> 32:01.905
<i>And a woman who was doing the
cooking, she made some, um,</i>

32:01.973 --> 32:05.909
<i>tortillas, and they got the
larva out of the wasp nest.</i>

32:05.977 --> 32:06.877
<i>And it's all right.</i>

32:06.944 --> 32:08.812
<i>We stuck them in some
chilies and stuff.</i>

32:11.048 --> 32:12.582
<i>That's really hot.</i>

32:12.650 --> 32:14.117
<i>I can't eat that.</i>

32:14.185 --> 32:14.985
<i>You can hardly taste them.</i>

32:15.052 --> 32:16.186
<i>The chilies are the more powerful.</i>

32:16.254 --> 32:17.187
<i>Well, don't put them in, then.</i>

32:17.255 --> 32:20.308
<i>If it's the chilies that's nice and the
sauce, don't bother with the grubs.</i>

32:20.958 --> 32:21.725
<i>Uhh!</i>

32:21.792 --> 32:22.959
<i>That's really hot.</i>

32:23.027 --> 32:27.430
<i>Uh, and then I thought I'd give
them some... some, you know,</i>

32:27.498 --> 32:29.933
<i>new experience.</i>

32:31.602 --> 32:32.235
<i>What's that?</i>

32:32.303 --> 32:33.303
<i>A bit of monster munch.</i>

32:33.371 --> 32:33.703
<i>Ahh.</i>

32:33.771 --> 32:38.742
<i>Pop it in your mouth.</i>

32:38.809 --> 32:40.610
<i>You like that?</i>

32:40.678 --> 32:41.945
<i>It's good, isn't it?</i>

32:42.013 --> 32:42.679
<i>Good.</i>

32:42.747 --> 32:45.882
<i>When I think Luis has had stuff
like that, you don't get</i>

32:45.950 --> 32:47.317
<i>that fat from wasp larva.</i>

32:47.385 --> 32:49.352
<i>I mean, he had a belly on him.</i>

32:49.420 --> 32:50.720
<i>And he kept saying, "Oh, no.</i>

32:50.788 --> 32:53.023
<i>It's the wasps that makes
you big and strong."</i>

32:53.090 --> 32:54.758
<i>How many are you eating?</i>

32:54.825 --> 32:58.128
<i>Because they're only that big, and
there's not much fat in them.</i>

32:58.195 --> 33:00.764
<i>Well, the Uncle... you could
tell he was kind of like,</i>

33:00.831 --> 33:02.332
<i>"Oh, this is all right, this."</i>

33:02.400 --> 33:04.334
<i>I think he enjoyed it.</i>

33:04.402 --> 33:05.802
<i>So I'm happy about that.</i>

33:05.870 --> 33:08.438
<i>I gave him a new experience
there I think...</i>

33:08.506 --> 33:12.142
<i>And just was open and get a
taste of something new and</i>

33:12.209 --> 33:13.109
<i>think, "You know what?</i>

33:13.177 --> 33:15.412
<i>I might leave this little
village and go into town and</i>

33:15.479 --> 33:16.862
<i>get some crisps."</i>

33:20.487 --> 33:23.687
<i>Anyway, off to see the wonder
that they built tomorrow.</i>

33:43.899 --> 33:46.101
I just saw something.

33:59.181 --> 34:00.615
What's that?

34:06.889 --> 34:09.791
Is someone pumping a tire up?

34:09.859 --> 34:12.327
Every wonder that I've been
to so far, I've been whinging

34:12.393 --> 34:14.896
a lot, so I'm gonna try and
change me attitude on this one

34:14.964 --> 34:17.165
'cause that's what this
trip's been about, really.

34:17.233 --> 34:20.400
I've been eating stuff all sorts of
stuff that I wouldn't normally eat.

34:20.469 --> 34:22.971
You know, I've been doing things
that I wouldn't normally do.

34:23.038 --> 34:25.572
So, I'm gonna try to go there with
the idea that I'm gonna love it.

34:25.641 --> 34:26.407
Is this it?

34:39.889 --> 34:42.824
Hello?

34:42.891 --> 34:44.292
Yeah, I'm filming now.

34:44.360 --> 34:49.797
I'm at the actual wonder.

34:49.864 --> 34:50.965
I told you what to do.

34:51.033 --> 34:55.303
Just get the... you get the
scart lead that's coming out

34:55.371 --> 34:57.605
of the back of the DVD player.

34:57.673 --> 34:59.841
Yeah, and just stick that
in the back of the telly.

34:59.909 --> 35:00.708
There's two holes.

35:00.776 --> 35:02.710
Use the first one.

35:06.115 --> 35:07.081
Yeah, it looks all right.

35:07.149 --> 35:10.251
Yeah, it's just a big pyramid.

35:10.319 --> 35:10.618
Right.

35:10.686 --> 35:12.720
Well, all you've got to do is
hit that a/v button on the

35:12.788 --> 35:14.856
remote control and
it will come up.

35:14.924 --> 35:16.391
All right.

35:16.458 --> 35:18.126
Talk to you later.

35:20.930 --> 35:21.729
<i>Iha!</i>

35:21.797 --> 35:25.400
<i>Welcome to Chichen Itza, home
to one of the most amazing and</i>

35:25.467 --> 35:28.736
<i>advanced cultures in
history, the Mayans.</i>

35:28.804 --> 35:31.639
<i>I'm Gabriella, and I
will be your host.</i>

35:31.707 --> 35:33.508
<i>Buenos días, Gabriella.</i>

35:33.576 --> 35:36.110
<i>Yes, the Maya were amazing.</i>

35:36.178 --> 35:38.613
<i>Archaeologists have uncovered
evidence that point to this</i>

35:38.681 --> 35:41.316
<i>site as once being covered
in human skulls.</i>

35:41.383 --> 35:44.352
<i>I mean, we only started
listening, and straightaway,</i>

35:44.420 --> 35:46.688
<i>it's, like, violence.</i>

35:46.755 --> 35:48.790
<i>It's just what they used to do
with all, like, these dead</i>

35:48.857 --> 35:52.660
<i>heads... stick the skulls
and frighten people off.</i>

35:52.728 --> 35:55.597
<i>So it was all cluttered in heads.</i>

35:55.664 --> 35:59.067
<i>If you lived around here, you'd
constantly be hearing, like,</i>

35:59.134 --> 36:01.736
<i>screaming going on and...
As nice as it is... it's lovely.</i>

36:01.804 --> 36:02.637
<i>Do you know what I mean?</i>

36:02.705 --> 36:05.740
<i>All these trees, nice buildings
and that, but that would make me</i>

36:05.808 --> 36:07.308
<i>go, "I want to move,"
to be honest.</i>

36:07.376 --> 36:09.877
<i>I mean, all that going on all
the time... someone screaming</i>

36:09.945 --> 36:10.645
<i>their trap out.</i>

36:10.713 --> 36:14.582
<i>"Aah."</i>

36:14.650 --> 36:17.185
<i>This would have been a good hiding
place when you think about it.</i>

36:17.253 --> 36:20.355
<i>If you're... if you're choosed to
have your head cut off, great</i>

36:20.422 --> 36:23.491
<i>place to sort of run
around, isn't it?</i>

36:23.559 --> 36:24.993
<i>Got too many, though.</i>

36:25.060 --> 36:29.864
<i>It's like an Ikea for,
like, columns, isn't it?</i>

36:29.932 --> 36:31.199
<i>Which one?
Which one would you want?</i>

36:31.267 --> 36:31.633
<i>Well, any.</i>

36:31.700 --> 36:32.400
<i>They're all the same.</i>

36:32.468 --> 36:34.602
<i>Just... can't get [Bleep] Of them.</i>

36:34.670 --> 36:35.870
<i>How many do you need?</i>

36:38.807 --> 36:41.943
<i>Standing at the tzompantli,
you can still get that eerie</i>

36:42.011 --> 36:45.013
<i>feeling that the spaniards felt
when they first witnessed the</i>

36:45.080 --> 36:47.615
<i>human sacrifice conducted
by the indigenous people</i>

36:47.683 --> 36:48.850
<i>throughout this region.</i>

36:48.917 --> 36:50.818
<i>Aaah!</i>

36:53.055 --> 36:56.257
That is big, isn't it?

36:56.325 --> 36:59.927
It's coming this way.

37:00.629 --> 37:02.229
No.

37:08.304 --> 37:11.072
Hey, he loved that.

37:11.140 --> 37:14.742
Want some more?

37:14.810 --> 37:16.177
Yeah, it seen it.

37:16.245 --> 37:19.314
Yeah, I'll have a
bit more of that.

37:19.381 --> 37:24.819
It's weird how you can have something
in common with something so different.

37:24.887 --> 37:30.325
That's like millions of
years old, isn't it?

37:30.392 --> 37:34.162
But he still likes to hobnob.

37:34.229 --> 37:36.564

38:37.661 --> 38:39.528
It's already starting.

38:39.730 --> 38:40.730
What's that?

38:42.199 --> 38:43.599
Oh, yeah.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.968
Got any, um, jumping beans?

38:46.036 --> 38:46.969
Mexican jumping beans?

38:47.037 --> 38:47.370
No.

38:47.437 --> 38:49.305
Do you know anyone who
does around here?

38:49.373 --> 38:50.206
No.

38:50.273 --> 38:50.840
No one.

38:50.907 --> 38:51.474
No.

38:51.541 --> 38:53.209
Why not?

38:53.276 --> 38:55.578
I tell you, you'd make a killing.

38:55.646 --> 38:58.681
Just get rid of half the plates,
add some jumping beans.

38:58.749 --> 39:00.182
So sorry.

39:02.185 --> 39:04.053
It's getting busy now, isn't it?

39:13.296 --> 39:14.864
What's the clapping thing about?

39:14.931 --> 39:17.299
Yeah, it's just...

39:26.176 --> 39:27.309
Oh, now I'm hearing it.

39:27.377 --> 39:28.511
It's like a boing, boing, boing.

39:28.578 --> 39:29.145
Yeah, yeah.

39:29.212 --> 39:33.649
Boing, boing, boing.

39:33.717 --> 39:34.517
Is that me doing that?

39:34.584 --> 39:36.018
Yeah.

39:38.922 --> 39:40.222
Just a fluke, though, isn't it?

39:40.290 --> 39:43.192
That can't be...
Whoever designed that didn't say

39:43.260 --> 39:44.627
to the builder, "Right, listen.

39:44.695 --> 39:47.830
I need some sort of structure,
some sort of platform that we

39:47.898 --> 39:51.067
can cut heads off, and when
the heads roll down, and just at

39:51.134 --> 39:53.703
the bottom, somebody want to clap,
and it sort of bounces back.

39:53.770 --> 39:55.805
They wouldn't... that just
wouldn't be on the to-do list.

39:56.673 --> 39:59.308
One, two, three.

39:59.376 --> 40:00.910
One, two, three.

40:00.977 --> 40:01.610
One, two, three.

40:02.679 --> 40:05.881
Is that... I mean, you know, is
that what they really wanted

40:05.949 --> 40:08.084
this to be like
when they built it?

40:08.151 --> 40:10.820
This wonder...
Wonder of the world?

40:10.887 --> 40:11.787
Is she all right, yeah?

40:11.855 --> 40:15.791
This woman's fainted.

40:15.859 --> 40:17.126
Oh.

40:17.194 --> 40:17.927
You see, though.

40:17.994 --> 40:18.861
Everybody loves it.

40:18.929 --> 40:21.530
It gets a bigger crowd then
the wonder now 'cause people go,

40:21.598 --> 40:23.299
"What's going on, Elsie?"

40:23.366 --> 40:25.067
Now they'll get the camera out.

40:25.135 --> 40:27.903
Think they're dying.

40:27.971 --> 40:28.804
Oh, she's still alive.

40:28.872 --> 40:31.307
Let's move on.

40:31.374 --> 40:32.608
The ambulance now.

40:35.846 --> 40:37.346
I prefer to get out of it now.

40:37.414 --> 40:38.414
I feel like I've seen it.

40:38.482 --> 40:40.850
I've had a bit of
a lesson with this.

40:40.917 --> 40:41.684
It's been all right.

40:41.752 --> 40:44.854
It's not been me favorite bit
of Mexico if I'm honest.

40:44.921 --> 40:48.190
More people flogging

40:48.258 --> 40:55.431
I'm half tempted just to sort of fall over
like that woman, get a lift home.

40:55.499 --> 40:58.534
I'm going home today.

40:58.602 --> 41:02.538
I'm always sort of happy
about going home.

41:02.606 --> 41:06.842
But, um, I've enjoyed
it here quite a lot.

41:06.910 --> 41:08.878
I'd probably say it's me
favorite place I've ever been

41:08.945 --> 41:12.882
to, which is a pretty big
statement, isn't it?

41:12.949 --> 41:14.583
I mean, the wonder wasn't great.

41:14.651 --> 41:17.953
I wouldn't say come to
Mexico to see the wonder.

41:18.021 --> 41:19.355
It's everything else.

41:19.422 --> 41:21.690
There doesn't seem to
be any sort of rules.

41:21.758 --> 41:24.393
They just do what they want to do.

41:24.461 --> 41:26.862
And I felt like I've been able
to do what I want to do once

41:26.930 --> 41:29.498
I've been here, really.

41:29.566 --> 41:30.800
Something else, as well.

41:30.867 --> 41:38.841
Women are quite... you know, they look
quite big... big people -a lot of them.

41:38.909 --> 41:41.210
Do you like that?

41:41.278 --> 41:41.777
In a way.

41:41.845 --> 41:43.379
Because they don't care.

41:43.446 --> 41:46.015
Our own women don't eat what
you want to eat, do they?

41:46.082 --> 41:47.183
You go, "What in the oven?"

41:47.250 --> 41:49.785
They'll go... you know, I'll say
to Suzanne, "We'll have chippy."

41:49.853 --> 41:50.553
"Yeah, all right.

41:50.620 --> 41:52.788
I'll just have... "I'll just
have haddock," and then I go,

41:52.856 --> 41:54.223
"Well, I'm having COD and chips."

41:54.291 --> 41:56.492
And you get them, and she's
like, "Can I have some chips?"

41:56.560 --> 41:57.159
"No, you can't.

41:57.227 --> 41:58.494
You had the option to have chips.

41:58.562 --> 41:59.528
You said you don't want to."

41:59.596 --> 42:02.932
It's all that thing about weight,
whereas here, she's having chips.

42:03.133 --> 42:04.366
She's having chips
day in, day out.

42:04.434 --> 42:05.267
She's not bothered.

42:05.335 --> 42:07.436
And I quite like that.

42:07.504 --> 42:11.006
It's a sort of a free spirit
they've got, isn't it?

42:11.074 --> 42:16.011
They live the life they want to live...
Which we don't really do at home.

42:17.409 --> 42:19.215
I like it.
I bet I could live here.

42:20.750 --> 42:21.632
For a bit.

42:23.736 --> 42:26.366
The only thing that I'm a bit
sort of *** about

42:27.212 --> 42:29.188
is not seeing
the Mexican jumping bean.

42:31.598 --> 42:32.878
Yeah...

42:34.868 --> 42:45.404
