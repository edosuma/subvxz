Stop moving,

00:02.828 --> 00:04.546
or you're gonna ruin your mani-pedi.

00:05.787 --> 00:06.999
After this pedi,

00:07.000 --> 00:09.159
I'm gonna have to return my man-i card.

00:10.516 --> 00:11.899
You know, if you had a girlfriend,

00:11.900 --> 00:14.419
you could do all this naily,
buffy, fluffy stuff with her.

00:14.836 --> 00:17.371
But you're the best kind
of girlfriend there is.

00:17.372 --> 00:18.690
You're not a girl.

00:20.173 --> 00:22.777
You know, women can be so gossipy.

00:23.186 --> 00:24.392
Oh my God, did I tell you what

00:24.393 --> 00:26.346
my boss, Ms. Jensen, said yesterday?

00:27.399 --> 00:29.469
Oh my God, what?

00:30.337 --> 00:32.534
She asked me to lunch.

00:32.536 --> 00:34.727
Which means she's gonna
ask me to the spa retreat,

00:34.728 --> 00:36.960
which leads to taking me under her wing,

00:36.961 --> 00:38.660
junior partner, partner,

00:38.661 --> 00:40.235
and one day, I'll be intimidating

00:40.236 --> 00:42.005
some poor girl over lunch.

00:43.405 --> 00:44.914
<i>Ben: Come on, Tucker. Why not?</i>

00:44.915 --> 00:46.350
Ohh! Here, take Emma.

00:46.351 --> 00:47.766
(Murmurs)

00:51.418 --> 00:54.693
Give me one good reason why I
can't meet your new girlfriend.

00:54.694 --> 00:57.084
Ben, you asked my last girlfriend

00:57.085 --> 00:59.290
if she wanted to
play peek-a-boob.

01:02.042 --> 01:04.027
And then you told her I moved

01:04.028 --> 01:06.690
when you decided you
didn't like her anymore.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.371
She was getting kind of clingy.

01:09.155 --> 01:10.754
Oh, Ben,

01:10.755 --> 01:13.474
a new girlfriend is like a gentle flower.

01:13.475 --> 01:15.547
She needs to be cared for and nurtured

01:15.548 --> 01:17.145
before she can blossom.

01:17.146 --> 01:20.253
And you, my friend, are
relationship weed killer.

01:21.522 --> 01:22.875
Oh!

01:25.465 --> 01:27.173
Hey, guys. What's going on?

01:27.488 --> 01:28.709
(Chuckles)

01:28.710 --> 01:30.168
Hey man, you can put socks on all you want,

01:30.169 --> 01:32.004
I still know it's pink under there.

01:32.932 --> 01:35.769
Tucker won't introduce us to
his new girlfriend, Stephanie.

01:35.770 --> 01:37.850
Oh, I already met her. She's nice.

01:37.851 --> 01:39.935
Yeah, me too. Super cute.

01:39.936 --> 01:40.907
(Mouthing)

01:41.767 --> 01:42.879
Tucker!

01:42.880 --> 01:44.499
Come on, man, I promise I'll be good.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.016
I'll do anything. Name it.

01:46.017 --> 01:47.881
Breakfast, lunch, dinner, cocktails?

01:47.882 --> 01:49.283
Just say when and where.

01:49.811 --> 01:51.060
Fine.

01:51.061 --> 01:53.473
She's in a play tonight.
Why don't you come see it?

01:54.175 --> 01:55.411
Could she be in a movie?

01:55.412 --> 01:57.179
I like those way more.

The last time I saw a play,

02:12.792 --> 02:15.897
you were prince charming and
Riley was tree number two.

02:16.316 --> 02:17.844
At least tonight mom
won't be in the audience

02:19.497 --> 02:20.551

02:20.552 --> 02:21.498
Well, let's just try to remember

02:28.468 --> 02:29.712
He's not coming.

02:29.713 --> 02:31.104
Well, if I knew that, I wouldn't have spent

02:31.105 --> 02:33.235
20 bucks to show I was a caring friend.

02:34.413 --> 02:37.223
Oh, here she is. Stephanie Morris.

02:37.771 --> 02:39.585
She kind of looks familiar to me.

02:40.519 --> 02:41.953
That's her.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.444
I just wish that I could place her.

02:46.073 --> 02:47.817
I...

02:47.818 --> 02:49.953
Release myself.

02:50.549 --> 02:52.164
And now I've placed her.

02:52.507 --> 02:54.392
Oh, this is not good.

02:54.393 --> 02:56.002
Really? I like it.

02:56.003 --> 02:57.875
Why don't we go to the theater more?

03:00.342 --> 03:02.000
How could you not remember dating her?

03:02.001 --> 03:03.366
I don't know. There's been like

03:03.367 --> 03:05.405
five or six Stephanies since then.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.467
Look, if they want me to remember faces,

03:07.468 --> 03:09.813
they should put them closer
to the parts I'm looking at.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.009
So have you told Tucker yet?

03:12.010 --> 03:13.354
Yeah, I was like "hey, bro,

03:13.355 --> 03:14.810
I dated Steph like three years ago.

03:14.811 --> 03:15.976
She totally hates me.

03:15.977 --> 03:17.403
Oh, and I saw her naked again."

03:17.404 --> 03:18.707
And then we hugged and he gave me

03:18.708 --> 03:20.090
a best friend trophy.

03:20.091 --> 03:22.475
Oh, good. I was afraid
that he was gonna be upset.

03:23.226 --> 03:24.700
No, I didn't tell him!

03:24.701 --> 03:25.870
If she finds out that I'm his roommate,

03:25.871 --> 03:27.306
she'll dump him in like two seconds.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.384
What did you do to her?

03:28.385 --> 03:29.614
Look, she had a really hot sister

03:29.615 --> 03:30.932
and a nice car.

03:30.933 --> 03:32.503
It was a crime of opportunity.

03:33.584 --> 03:35.908
You're probably wondering why
I asked you to lunch today.

03:35.909 --> 03:37.548
You want to invite me
to super swanky spa day

03:37.549 --> 03:39.711
at three pines spa from
10:00 to 2:00 on Wednesday?

03:40.441 --> 03:41.988
That's just a guess.

03:42.459 --> 03:43.828
Oh, hey, Riles.

03:43.829 --> 03:46.535
Working through lunch by
not being at work again?

03:46.536 --> 03:47.555
Mrs. Wheeler,

03:47.556 --> 03:50.169
you remember Ms. Jensen, my boss.

03:50.170 --> 03:51.703
As I recall, last time I saw you,

03:51.704 --> 03:53.264
you were threatening to sue me.

03:53.653 --> 03:55.882
Well, don't you have a terrific memory.

03:55.883 --> 03:57.500
What do you say we try to lose it, huh?

03:57.501 --> 03:58.617
Drinks on me.

03:58.618 --> 04:00.276
So what do lawyers drink?

04:00.277 --> 04:02.865
Scotch with an "ambulance" chaser?

04:02.866 --> 04:04.003
(Laughs)

04:04.587 --> 04:06.472
I won't "object" to that.

04:06.473 --> 04:07.672
Oh. (Chuckles)

04:07.673 --> 04:08.948
You care to join us?

04:08.949 --> 04:10.823
No no no, she is far too busy.

04:10.824 --> 04:12.289
Oh, no, I'm not.

04:12.896 --> 04:15.110
Oh. Your daughter is adorable.

04:15.111 --> 04:16.382
Oh, thanks, thanks.

04:16.382 --> 04:17.644
<i>But she's not mine.</i>

04:17.646 --> 04:20.130
My son knocked up some girl he barely knew.

04:20.132 --> 04:21.762
He's thoughtful like that.

04:22.257 --> 04:24.186
That's exactly how I got my grandson.

04:24.187 --> 04:27.531
Honey, we are far too young
and pretty to be grandmas.

04:27.532 --> 04:28.901
Okay, you are telling me.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.856
- Come on, hello.
- Look at that, yeah.

04:30.857 --> 04:33.935
This is fun. Thank you so much
for stopping by,

04:33.936 --> 04:36.650
but Ms. Jensen and I have some
important business to handle.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.869
No, we don't.

04:38.207 --> 04:39.950
Oh, but I forgot to mention

04:39.951 --> 04:41.960
all the guests get to bring a plus one.

04:41.961 --> 04:44.372
I don't trust a woman who
doesn't have any girlfriends.

04:44.841 --> 04:47.576
That's great, 'cause I have oodles.

04:47.985 --> 04:49.342
Really?

04:49.343 --> 04:50.844
Name one oodle.

04:51.568 --> 04:53.562
Well, you-dle.

04:55.076 --> 04:57.278
Perfect. Then you can bring her to spa day.

04:57.279 --> 04:58.936
(Gasps) Ooh, spa day.

04:58.937 --> 05:00.627
Oh, I love a good massage.

05:00.628 --> 05:02.090
Swedish, thai,

hands of some young guy.

05:03.786 --> 05:04.976
(Both chuckle)

05:05.830 --> 05:06.948
I just need to avoid her

05:06.949 --> 05:08.439
until the relationship runs its course.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.004
I give it like two weeks Max.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.266
It's not gonna be a problem.

05:11.968 --> 05:13.265
It's a problem.

05:13.828 --> 05:16.734
- Hey, what's up, Danny?
- Tucker, Stephanie, hi.

05:16.735 --> 05:18.834
I almost didn't recognize
you with your clothes on.

05:20.082 --> 05:21.988
What are you talking about?
What is he talking about?

05:22.886 --> 05:24.231
Oh, her play.

05:24.232 --> 05:26.961
The informatively titled "the naked girl."

05:26.962 --> 05:28.733
I thought that was a metaphor.

05:29.666 --> 05:30.963
Didn't I mention that?

05:30.964 --> 05:32.910
No. No no no. I think
I would have remembered.

05:32.911 --> 05:34.764
Yeah. I think I would have
invited a very different

05:34.765 --> 05:36.555
group of people to see it.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.272
<i>Riley: I can't believe I

Danny, hi.

05:54.947 --> 05:56.697
I seem to keep running into you everywhere.

05:57.844 --> 05:59.031
Oh, hi.

05:59.032 --> 06:00.813
You can have my room in like two minutes.

06:00.814 --> 06:03.295
Or here's a crazy idea

06:03.296 --> 06:05.906
maybe you two gal pals could
try on clothes together.

06:06.683 --> 06:07.848
Why would we do that?

06:07.849 --> 06:09.607
Because it's what girlfriends do.

06:09.608 --> 06:11.421
(Whispers) Oh, right. Thank you.

06:11.422 --> 06:13.504
Um, of course. Of course they do.

06:13.505 --> 06:15.850
I mean, 'cause at least that's what I do

06:15.851 --> 06:17.133

Yes.

08:42.416 --> 08:43.567
Wow.

08:43.568 --> 08:45.129
Take away your cellphones, and you kids

08:45.130 --> 08:46.847
don't know how to talk to each other.

08:46.848 --> 08:48.782
Ben, Steph, Steph, Ben. You good?

08:48.783 --> 08:50.105
I know I am.

08:50.106 --> 08:51.612
See you around.

08:51.613 --> 08:53.090
(Chuckles)

08:53.843 --> 08:55.650
It's nice to meet me?

08:55.651 --> 08:58.474
Oh, it is nice to meet you, Ben.

08:58.475 --> 09:00.513
It's when people actually get to know you

09:00.514 --> 09:02.079
you run into problems.

09:02.549 --> 09:05.617
I believe this is yours.

09:09.330 --> 09:10.511
Oh my God, Riley,

09:10.512 --> 09:12.475
I am so excited for spa day.

09:12.476 --> 09:14.119
I even bought new flip-flops.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.089
Well, actually, I stole
them from my last spa day.

09:18.273 --> 09:19.346
But don't worry,

09:19.347 --> 09:20.613
I won't do it again.

09:20.614 --> 09:22.025
I need towels now.

09:23.010 --> 09:24.943
Mrs. Wheeler, bad news.

09:25.294 --> 09:27.607
The spa burned down.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.904
What?!

09:28.905 --> 09:31.072
I know. Someone left the sauna on.

09:31.073 --> 09:32.565
So...

09:32.566 --> 09:34.744
I'll just let you know when we reschedule.

09:34.745 --> 09:35.781
Oh...

09:35.782 --> 09:37.614
But I just got waxed.

09:38.993 --> 09:41.731
You know, you gotta straighten
up before the cleaning lady comes.

09:43.637 --> 09:44.522
Oh.

09:44.956 --> 09:46.856
Hey, Riles, thank you so much

09:46.857 --> 09:48.886
for inviting Steph to spa day.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.039
You are a really good friend.

09:52.116 --> 09:53.398
Bye now.

10:00.272 --> 10:02.160
Liar, liar!

10:03.441 --> 10:06.868
It seems the spa is not on fire!

10:07.460 --> 10:08.469
Mrs. Wheeler.

10:08.470 --> 10:10.288
Mrs. Wheeler, I'm sorry, I just...

10:10.289 --> 10:12.429
I wanted to bring a real girlfriend.

10:12.430 --> 10:14.291
You know, one who hasn't given birth

10:14.292 --> 10:15.422
- to my friends.
- (Scoffs)

10:17.021 --> 10:19.833
Or maybe you think I'll be loud and crass

10:19.834 --> 10:21.805
and tell stories about how you used to be

10:21.806 --> 10:23.183
a chubby little
know-it-all,

10:23.184 --> 10:25.221
and then failed the bar three times.

10:26.233 --> 10:28.029
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

10:29.022 --> 10:30.319
And to think...

10:30.320 --> 10:31.991
I stole you an eye mask.

10:39.593 --> 10:42.085
Her last words to me were
"I will get even with you."

10:42.086 --> 10:44.383
There's no way that
Stephanie didn't recognize me.

10:44.384 --> 10:45.954
Maybe you weren't as big a deal to her

10:45.955 --> 10:47.283
as you thought you were.

10:47.999 --> 10:50.217
Oh, trust me, I was a big deal.

10:50.218 --> 10:52.402
That was the year I had
that awesome faux-hawk.

10:56.467 --> 10:58.274
Well, this is a little awkward.

10:58.275 --> 10:59.396
(Chuckles)

10:59.397 --> 11:01.048
Any chance you guys would
believe I wore this outfit

11:01.049 --> 11:02.210
two days in a row?

11:02.916 --> 11:04.245
Hi, Stephanie.

11:04.246 --> 11:05.366
Ben.

11:05.367 --> 11:06.432
Hey, how's it going?

11:06.433 --> 11:07.588
Didn't know you spent the night.

11:07.589 --> 11:09.959
Yeah, well, that Tucker
can be very persuasive.

11:10.574 --> 11:12.685
So persuasive I'm actually
late to meet Riley.

11:12.686 --> 11:13.795
I'll see you.

11:16.598 --> 11:18.198
Oh my God.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.001
Can you not see it? She's a monster.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.711
Of all the guys in New York,

11:22.712 --> 11:24.015
she's dating my roommate?

11:24.016 --> 11:26.549
And after two days, she's
best friends with Riley?

11:26.550 --> 11:28.741
Coincidence? I don't think so.

11:28.742 --> 11:30.790
So you really think she's doing all of this

11:30.791 --> 11:32.348
just to get even with you?

11:32.349 --> 11:33.957
Hey, I make women do things.

11:35.812 --> 11:37.285
Not always good things,

11:38.686 --> 11:40.039
but things.

11:44.933 --> 11:46.145
Hold the door.

11:47.152 --> 11:48.374
How's it going?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.501
Oh, you know how it's going.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.985
It's just you and me now, Steph.

11:51.986 --> 11:53.468
You can quit pretending.

11:53.469 --> 11:55.209
Should I pretend that I have any idea

11:55.210 --> 11:56.476
what you're talking about?

11:56.477 --> 11:58.095
Oh, okay. Fine.

11:58.096 --> 11:59.624
Maybe one of these catchy little phrases

11:59.625 --> 12:00.833
will jog your memory.

12:00.834 --> 12:01.970
"Get off my couch!

12:01.971 --> 12:03.172
Get off my property!"

12:03.173 --> 12:04.434
Or my personal favorite,

12:04.435 --> 12:05.825
"get off my sister!"

12:06.940 --> 12:08.911
Oh my God.

12:08.912 --> 12:11.053
You are still such a self-centered jerk.

12:11.054 --> 12:12.907
Ah-ha! You do remember me.

12:12.908 --> 12:14.093
I knew it.

12:14.094 --> 12:15.911
Yes, Ben. I remember you.

12:15.912 --> 12:18.014
I think I actually paid for that t-shirt.

12:19.340 --> 12:21.472
Well, I'm not gonna let you get back at me

12:21.473 --> 12:22.781
by using Tucker.

12:22.782 --> 12:24.506
How am I using Tucker?

12:24.507 --> 12:25.839
I never would have gone out with him

12:25.840 --> 12:27.547
if I knew he was your roommate.

12:27.548 --> 12:28.628
But there you were,

12:28.629 --> 12:29.949
so I thought we could both be cool

12:29.950 --> 12:32.058
and pretend we never happened.

12:32.059 --> 12:34.062
Oh, is that what we're doing?

12:35.103 --> 12:37.548
You know what? I can't do this.

12:38.417 --> 12:39.673
I can't come over here

12:39.674 --> 12:40.860
and worry about running into you

12:40.861 --> 12:42.665
every time I want to see Tucker.

12:42.666 --> 12:44.416
What are you saying?

12:44.417 --> 12:46.606
<i>- (Elevator dings)
- I have to break up with him.</i>

12:46.607 --> 12:48.983
Feel free to tell him why.

12:51.279 --> 12:54.252
Would you change your mind if
I paid you back for the t-shirt?

12:58.173 --> 13:01.598
So remember, ladies.
Today is all about fun.

13:01.599 --> 13:04.005
Not as much fun as suing people.

13:04.490 --> 13:05.468
(Chuckles)

13:05.469 --> 13:07.227
But if someone were to slip and fall,

13:07.228 --> 13:09.357
maybe we can kill two birds with one stone.

13:10.849 --> 13:12.053
Go enjoy.

13:12.613 --> 13:14.338
Ms. Jensen, hi.

13:14.339 --> 13:16.031
I just wanted to
introduce you to Stephanie,

13:16.032 --> 13:19.182
my plus one, gal pal, confidante.

13:19.183 --> 13:21.042
Because you know, if I'm anything,

13:21.043 --> 13:23.910
it's a girl who loves girls.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.263
As friends.

13:28.003 --> 13:29.043
(Chuckles)

13:29.044 --> 13:31.249
Well, sorry to hear about
your little scheduling snafu.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.343
Bonnie called and told me.

13:32.690 --> 13:34.203
Bonnie called you?

13:34.204 --> 13:36.282
Yeah. She said you'd forgotten

13:36.283 --> 13:37.735
you already had plans with Stephanie.

13:37.736 --> 13:39.712
Oh, she couldn't have
been more lovely about it.

13:39.713 --> 13:41.388
Really? I'm sorry.

13:41.389 --> 13:43.889
We're talking about Bonnie Wheeler, right?

13:44.199 --> 13:45.711
Yep!

13:48.898 --> 13:50.492
Hey, Maggie-mae.

13:50.493 --> 13:52.443
You ready to get our rub on?

13:53.096 --> 13:55.587
Whoa, this place is on fire,

13:55.588 --> 13:57.806
isn't it, Riley, huh?

13:58.219 --> 14:01.081
Oh, she's my plus one.

14:02.189 --> 14:04.580
All you had to do was
just keep your mouth shut.

14:04.581 --> 14:06.075
Why couldn't you just leave it alone?

14:06.076 --> 14:08.078
Well, if I knew that, I
would have left it alone.

14:09.476 --> 14:11.264
I just got a text from Stephanie.

14:11.265 --> 14:13.062
I think she's gonna break up with me.

14:13.063 --> 14:15.092
What? Why would she do that?

14:15.925 --> 14:17.917
You don't know why she
would do that, do you?

14:18.460 --> 14:19.760
No, I don't know.

14:19.761 --> 14:21.808
I mean, we just had our first sleepover.

14:22.288 --> 14:23.778
Ohh.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.204
That's probably it.

14:29.041 --> 14:30.871
Look, man, she just said
she needs to talk to me

14:30.872 --> 14:32.741
as soon as she gets home from the spa.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.655
You know what? I'm
gonna call her right now.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.012
No no no no, you can't call her.

14:36.013 --> 14:38.589
This isn't the kind of thing
you want to do over the phone.

14:39.366 --> 14:40.921
Yeah, you're right.
I'm gonna go down there,

14:40.922 --> 14:42.409
and I'm gonna make her
talk to me face-to-face.

14:42.410 --> 14:43.511
Wait, now?

14:43.829 --> 14:46.046
No no no. You can't go down there now.

14:46.047 --> 14:48.120
- Why not?
- Because...

14:48.121 --> 14:50.497
Because you need to figure
out what you're gonna say.

14:50.498 --> 14:51.678
You need to lay out your arguments

14:51.679 --> 14:54.185
and convince her she's making
the biggest mistake of her life.

14:54.669 --> 14:55.868
Yeah.

14:58.162 --> 14:59.872
Yeah, you're right, Danny. Thanks.

15:00.295 --> 15:01.369
All right, Stephanie,

15:01.858 --> 15:05.295
here's five reasons why you
should not break up with me.

15:06.498 --> 15:08.729
Number one, I'm a catch.

15:09.890 --> 15:11.009
And number two,

15:11.010 --> 15:12.537
I make good lists.

15:14.961 --> 15:16.531
Okay, perfect. Now we just
need to convince Stephanie

15:16.532 --> 15:18.404
not to break up with Tucker
before he finishes that list.

15:18.405 --> 15:19.675
Go go go go go.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.153
This is lovely, Marge.

15:24.154 --> 15:27.283
And I have to say, my first group massage.

15:28.253 --> 15:30.723
Well, at a spa.

15:32.448 --> 15:33.802
(Russian accent) You two,

15:33.803 --> 15:36.810
less talk, more relax!

15:38.329 --> 15:39.599
Yeah, this is us.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.920
Oh, I am so sorry, ladies.

15:40.921 --> 15:42.677
There's been some sort
of scheduling mix-up.

15:42.678 --> 15:45.105
I have pictures of you at
the Christmas party. Get out.

15:47.587 --> 15:49.047
- Thank you.
- You're tiny.

15:49.048 --> 15:51.132
I will try not to break you.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.047
Ooh, slow jams.

15:55.048 --> 15:58.190
♪ Uhh, uhh, forever

15:58.191 --> 15:59.488
♪ yeah.

15:59.489 --> 16:01.158
- Shh!
- (Grunts)

16:02.833 --> 16:04.848
Why couldn't you have just stayed home?

16:04.849 --> 16:06.505
And why couldn't you have invited me

16:06.506 --> 16:07.789
as your plus one?

16:07.790 --> 16:09.882
Oh, I guess we all have questions.

16:10.979 --> 16:12.363
But this is important to me.

16:12.364 --> 16:14.604
I have to make partner by 30.

16:14.605 --> 16:16.256
It's on my vision board.

16:19.233 --> 16:20.283
Stephanie?

16:20.284 --> 16:21.810
Who you? Where is Victor?

16:21.811 --> 16:23.672
Oh, uh, Victor is sick.

16:23.673 --> 16:25.901
(Sighs) Victor is always sick.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.208
Shoes off, this on, let's go.

16:28.209 --> 16:29.330
You know...

16:29.331 --> 16:30.479
I was just hoping I could...

16:30.480 --> 16:31.520
shut, you go.

16:31.521 --> 16:32.793
- Is there any chance...
- No, you go.

16:32.794 --> 16:34.280
- No, but I have to just talk to the girl...
- This one!

16:34.281 --> 16:35.764
- Okay, relax.
- Go! Come on.

16:35.765 --> 16:37.851
Less talk, more work. More work.

16:37.852 --> 16:39.684
Go.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.341
Hey.

16:44.342 --> 16:46.812
Those muscles aren't
gonna massage themselves.

16:46.813 --> 16:49.157
Now get up in there and
start moving stuff around.

16:50.204 --> 16:51.329
Go.

16:51.641 --> 16:52.746
Hey there.

16:52.747 --> 16:55.148
Can you tell me what time
Stephanie Morris will be done?

16:59.696 --> 17:01.633
Completely unrelated...

17:02.487 --> 17:06.201
If we were dating, would
you break up with me?

17:10.781 --> 17:13.175
Oh yeah. Oh, that's it.

17:13.175 --> 17:14.290
Oh!

17:14.290 --> 17:16.125
Get up in there!

17:16.126 --> 17:17.334
Ben!

17:17.335 --> 17:19.354
What is taking so long? Tucker is here.

17:19.355 --> 17:21.085
Who are you? Where's Dimitri?

17:21.086 --> 17:22.969
Oh, uh, Dimitri is sick too.

17:22.970 --> 17:24.471
Men, useless.

17:24.472 --> 17:26.106
One little sniffle,

17:26.107 --> 17:28.213
and oh, you think you are die.

17:28.708 --> 17:30.303
Shoes off.

17:30.304 --> 17:31.862
Um, I really don't think...

17:31.863 --> 17:34.243
no, shut face. Move, go. Go.

17:34.244 --> 17:35.830
Yes. Go.

17:35.831 --> 17:37.540
You take loud blonde lady.

17:37.541 --> 17:38.626
Go go go go.

17:38.627 --> 17:39.902
- Ben?
- Just do it.

17:39.903 --> 17:41.250
But I thought you just
wanted to talk to Steph.

17:41.251 --> 17:43.173
Less talk, more work. Go!

17:45.026 --> 17:47.678
Hey! Pokey-hontas.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.040
How about we use all 10 little Indians,

17:51.041 --> 17:53.043
all right? Put your back into it.

17:54.847 --> 17:56.966
Hey, what's going on up there?

17:56.967 --> 18:00.405
You got me saddled up, but we
don't seem to be leaving the stable.

18:02.555 --> 18:05.833
You two, lady-fingered girly hands,

18:05.834 --> 18:08.427
take stick and bird. Go.

18:10.896 --> 18:12.746
- (Grunts)
- Oh yeah.

18:12.747 --> 18:14.337
All right, there it is.

18:16.355 --> 18:18.095
Hey, Steph, can we talk?

18:18.096 --> 18:19.977
What are you doing here?

18:23.277 --> 18:24.611
(Gasps) Danny?

18:24.612 --> 18:27.198
What are you doing and
why are you massaging me?

18:27.646 --> 18:31.165
Well... They put me on my mom,
and that was just wrong.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.333
What's going on?

18:34.334 --> 18:35.709
I don't know what's going on,

18:35.710 --> 18:37.068
but I'm leaving.

18:38.138 --> 18:39.444
Oh, hey, Steph.

18:39.983 --> 18:41.270
Ben?

18:41.271 --> 18:43.690
Hey, Tuck. Look who I found.

18:43.691 --> 18:45.676
I just felt so bad that
we never met before.

18:45.677 --> 18:47.752
It's very nice to meet you, Stephanie.

18:48.471 --> 18:50.362
Well, too bad I can't say the same.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.924
Ooh, massage and a show.

18:53.863 --> 18:55.484
Girl, get up.

18:55.485 --> 18:56.906
You're missing a good one.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.598
Wait, do you two know each other?

18:59.599 --> 19:00.819
Yeah.

19:00.820 --> 19:03.611
Yeah, we do. We dated like three years ago.

19:03.612 --> 19:05.932
And are you why she
wants to break up with me?

19:05.933 --> 19:07.742
Yes. Yes, I am.

19:09.624 --> 19:12.476
I am so sorry about this.

19:12.477 --> 19:14.688
What does this have to do with you?

19:15.187 --> 19:17.028
Absolutely nothing.

19:18.568 --> 19:20.107
Stephanie, you're not dating me.

19:20.108 --> 19:21.552
You're dating Tucker.

19:21.553 --> 19:23.921
And Tucker's a really wonderful guy.

19:23.922 --> 19:27.244
So please, don't let your
future be dictated by our past.

19:28.399 --> 19:30.188
I just came up with that.

19:31.035 --> 19:32.499
Ben, if I had to stay away from

19:32.500 --> 19:34.393
every girl you've ever offended,

19:34.394 --> 19:36.225
I would never have a date in this city.

19:37.787 --> 19:38.910
Steph...

19:39.322 --> 19:41.029
I am perfectly capable

19:41.030 --> 19:42.700
of screwing up a relationship

19:42.701 --> 19:44.097
all on my own.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.727
And I would really like to
screw this one up with you.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.087
And if that's not a good enough reason,

19:52.088 --> 19:54.655
I got like five more just ready to go.

19:55.626 --> 19:57.399
I don't think I need to hear them.

19:57.715 --> 20:00.270
So you're not gonna break up with Tucker?

20:00.271 --> 20:01.610
No.

20:06.002 --> 20:07.422
Too bad.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.095
If change mind,

20:09.984 --> 20:12.067
I take little one.

20:16.856 --> 20:18.629
I make him man.

20:19.981 --> 20:21.385
(Mouthing)

20:21.386 --> 20:22.872
Well, if she's taking the little one,

20:23.329 --> 20:25.115
I'm gonna take the big one.

20:26.679 --> 20:28.669
Come on over here and take mama home.

20:30.899 --> 20:32.721
(Sighs) Oh my gosh,

20:32.722 --> 20:34.655
that felt so good.

20:34.656 --> 20:36.023
What did I miss?

20:36.024 --> 20:37.588
- Hey, mom.
- Oh God, Danny!

20:41.467 --> 20:43.123
<i>Bonnie: No, Margie, I'm telling you</i>

20:43.124 --> 20:46.862
nobody will work harder than
Riley to get that promotion.

20:46.863 --> 20:48.144
In fact,

20:48.502 --> 20:50.776
she's working right now.

20:52.359 --> 20:54.168
All right, Peggy-sue.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.841
Yeah, I'll see you at brunch tomorrow.

20:55.842 --> 20:57.619
Bye-bye. (Cellphone beeps)

20:57.620 --> 20:59.510
Okay, all right. My toes are happy,

20:59.511 --> 21:01.389
but my glass isn't.

21:02.496 --> 21:04.348
Sorry, Mrs. Wheeler.

21:04.349 --> 21:07.127
Thank you for putting
in a good word for me.

21:07.128 --> 21:09.530
Yeah. Well, that's what friends are for.

21:10.594 --> 21:12.001
You know what?

21:12.002 --> 21:13.533
You were right.

21:13.534 --> 21:16.210
Let's go back to that other color.
