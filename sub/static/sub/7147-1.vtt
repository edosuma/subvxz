00:35.786 --> 00:37.959
Agent Cortez? This is Danger D'Amo.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.873
Give me a status update.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.465
Visual ID has been made.

00:43.627 --> 00:46.722
The subject has entered
the location right on time.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.054
be on the alert.

00:50.801 --> 00:55.102
Subject known as Tick Tock has the
stolen OSS mini disc.

00:55.264 --> 00:58.643
Alpha and Bravo teams,
move in to apprehend the target.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.064
Freeze!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.402
He's got time bombs!

01:04.565 --> 01:06.533
Be careful what you wish for!

01:12.281 --> 01:14.784
Tick Tock has the stolen
OSS mini disc and is on the move.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.998
Sorry I can't hang around.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.164
On-site arrival in four minutes.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.083
We don't have four minutes!
I'll get him faster with the zip line.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.088
If I don't catch him now, who knows
how many people he'll freeze?

01:29.840 --> 01:31.342
You're pregnant.

01:31.883 --> 01:35.012
Yeah, well, they say you can exercise
up until the last day of pregnancy,

01:35.178 --> 01:36.350
so, here we go.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.815
- Contraction!

01:41.977 --> 01:44.321
You're about to become a mom.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.857
All the more reason
to get the job done now.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.361
We can't let Tick Took escape again.

01:59.328 --> 02:02.207
- Breathe.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.626
- Try not to hit that bus.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.508
- Mute road noise.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.594
- Call Wilbur.
- Calling husband.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.681
Oh, there she is. How's my girl?

02:15.552 --> 02:16.394
You just leaving work?

02:17.220 --> 02:19.973
Yeah, just tying up a few things.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.685
Nine months pregnant
and still working around the clock.

02:23.852 --> 02:27.402
You've got to be the most dedicated
interior decorator that ever lived.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.737
What can I say? I love my work.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.368
- Ooh!

02:32.235 --> 02:33.862
Here's what I really called about.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.082
Guess who decided
to pay us an early visit?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.036
Is this it?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.911
I'm on my way to the hospital.
Meet me there?

02:41.078 --> 02:44.252
Right. Hospital. Don't panic.
I'm here for you.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.167
- All you have to do...

02:47.334 --> 02:50.713
...is breathe easy and breathe often...

02:57.052 --> 02:59.601
I love you so... much.

03:02.182 --> 03:02.853
Keep breathing.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.018
- You're gonna be just fine.
- Yep. Gotcha. See you there.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.119
Wait for backup!

03:21.284 --> 03:23.878
Contractions are only

03:37.134 --> 03:40.479
OK, Tick Tock. Hand over the mini disc.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.766
- Ah, man.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.980
Don't underestimate her.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.646
- I think my water just broke.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.690
I hope that was my water.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.572
Clean her clock.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.874
Cut me some slack,
I'm having a contraction.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.629
- Congratulations...

04:19.593 --> 04:21.937
I look forward to doing this again.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.310
Swell work, Agent Cortez.

04:24.473 --> 04:27.727
Aces. I knew you had it in you.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.904
If this got into the wrong hands,

04:32.063 --> 04:34.486
our world would've
stopped in its tracks.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.867
Looks like an old OSS file.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.624
the ultimate weapon.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.878
This baby not only takes out
your enemy, it takes out everyone.

04:46.036 --> 04:50.132
No one ever notices time
until it's gone.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.889
This was our agreement.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.516
One last mission and I'm out for good.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.143
You're really gonna take a powder
on us? Leave us high and dry?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.805
No more dangling from zip lines
or high-speed chases.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.518
My family needs me now.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.354
And they can never know I was a spy.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.646
I respect that, agent. But a word
of advice: tell 'em who you are.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.610
Life's too short for secrets.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.109
Push out a good one, a nice little
fire-breather for us, all right?

05:17.275 --> 05:19.243
The future of the OSS depends on it.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.030
Let's not stand around
bumping gums, people.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.453
I wanna figure out what
makes Tick Tock tick.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.503
Go.

05:34.543 --> 05:38.093
Hey, kids. I got a new idea
for a reality show.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.178
It's called
Wilbur Wilson: Spy Hunter

05:41.341 --> 05:44.015
where I hunt real spies on TV.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.930
- What do you think?
- Uh, it's pretty out there, Dad.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.436
- Got you.

05:49.599 --> 05:54.025
One point for me. Yeah, I mean,
where are you gonna find a spy?

05:54.938 --> 05:57.111
- Hi! Honey!
- Hey, sweetheart!

05:57.274 --> 05:58.947
Hey, you look great.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.118
You owe me a dollar.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.873
Told you we would get here before her.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.908
I said take it slow, but that was
a night shy of eternity

06:07.075 --> 06:08.292
and a morning past forever.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.874
Stepmother is always
late for everything.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.792
Technically I'm early, 'cause the baby
wasn't even due until tomorrow.

06:14.958 --> 06:15.959
Ease up.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.423
What took so long?

06:17.586 --> 06:20.260
Uh, just must have lost track of time.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.641
- Here we go! Oh!

06:22.799 --> 06:24.893
Jeez! Guys, guys, guys, guys.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.429
From this point on,
everything'll be different.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.143
In a good way, right?

06:29.306 --> 06:31.308
Yeah. And you'll have
a new baby sister

06:31.474 --> 06:35.479
- in five, four, three, two...

06:53.872 --> 06:56.000
I put my life on the line

06:56.166 --> 06:57.793
every time I search for...

06:57.959 --> 07:00.132
...the spies among us.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.474
Look!

07:05.634 --> 07:07.432
I'm Wilbur Wilson...

07:07.844 --> 07:09.221
...Spy Hunter.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.185
Mondays after your local news.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.519
Last piece of bacon.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.365
Is the baby throwing food again?

07:26.321 --> 07:28.369
- I would say so.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.124
Can you watch her, please?

07:30.283 --> 07:33.628
I have to go change again.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.538
Again.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.503
- Ah! Seriously?

07:37.666 --> 07:41.045
Her gas bombs are gonna
take the paint right off this house.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.888
- You watch her.
- No. You.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.890
- Breath-holding contest?
- You're on.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.351
One point for me.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.892
- Good morning, little Spy Hunters.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.651
Do you have time
to eat breakfast with us?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.278
- I sure do.
- Yes!

07:59.813 --> 08:01.315
No, I don't.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.819
I swear I had an extra five minutes...

08:05.485 --> 08:07.453
...just a few minutes ago.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.204
- Where'd the time go?

08:12.283 --> 08:13.409
You owe me a dollar.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.921
Hey...
Do you remember our five-year plan?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.753
If my show does well,

08:18.915 --> 08:21.589
then I'll have all
the time in the world

08:21.751 --> 08:25.472
to spend with you and you, OK?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.598
Meanwhile, time is just slipping away.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.851
- Morning, honey.
- Oh, bye, honey.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.763
- I gotta get to work.
- Oh, um, OK.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.273
- Uh, good-bye hug?
- Oh, yeah.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.059
Uh...

08:41.229 --> 08:42.196
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.574
- Rebecca, behave at school. OK?
- I know.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.827
And, Cecil, uh...

08:47.152 --> 08:48.449
...feed the dog.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.284
He doesn't really eat.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.745
He just watches us.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.409
Here, Argonaut.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.630
It's kind of creepy.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.628
Time is speeding up.

09:04.794 --> 09:08.173
You're not cranking my chain, are you?
This is on the up and up?

09:09.007 --> 09:10.304
- Good night?

09:10.467 --> 09:13.186
What are you talking about, doll face?
You just got back from lunch.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.223
- But it's five o'clock, sir.
- Five o'clock?

09:21.978 --> 09:23.980
We're running out of time.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.494
and jelly sandwich in your face

09:29.652 --> 09:31.279
and then he stole your homework?

09:31.446 --> 09:35.246
Technically, it was his homework.
I was just doing it for him.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.503
And what about you, Miss Rebecca?
How was your day?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.914
Same old, same old.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.749
- So I heard.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.964
The principal called me
about your pranks.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.174
- Hey, kids!
- Dad! Come, sit by me!

09:47.337 --> 09:51.183
Sorry, kids, but I have to go write up
this report before I can do anything.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.718
Save me some leftovers.

09:52.884 --> 09:56.184
Hey, Dad? Can you teach me
how to be a Spy Hunter?

09:57.347 --> 09:59.691
Well, there's always time for that.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.318
OK. Repeat after me:

10:02.477 --> 10:05.071
"I'm Cecil Wilson, Spy Hunter,

10:05.230 --> 10:09.235
and I'll catch you... later."

10:09.609 --> 10:12.203
I'm Cecil Wilson, Spy Hunter,

10:12.362 --> 10:15.866
and I'll catch you... later!

10:16.032 --> 10:18.034
Here's the important part.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.370
Lift the eyebrow.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.715
Respect the golden arch.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.217
That's my secret.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.470
How many spies have you caught?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.557
Um... Well, none.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.309
Um... But that's not really
what the show's about.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.846
So you're not
a spy-catching superhero?

10:40.557 --> 10:42.104
_..but.._

10:43.101 --> 10:44.068
How's my girl?

10:44.227 --> 10:46.025
She made two poopies today.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.906
Two poopies?
She's six away from the house record.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.157
- Oh!

10:54.612 --> 10:56.205
I lost my appetite.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.912
I'll go talk to her.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.920
What am I doing wrong?

11:06.082 --> 11:08.255
I've tried so hard
to connect with her

11:08.418 --> 11:11.171
- but she just hates me.
- No, she doesn't hate you.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.841
- She totally hates me.
- No, she doesn't. Maybe a little.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.430
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

11:16.593 --> 11:20.348
I think she's just trying
to adjust to a new situation.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.021
We've been married for two years.

11:24.934 --> 11:25.935
Right.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.648
ever since Stepmother
entered the picture.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.738
And she's keeping something from us.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.948
I can feel it.
She's not who she says she is!

11:38.114 --> 11:40.458
You don't think she's
really an interior decorator?

11:40.617 --> 11:44.588
Well, look at this place!
She's obviously evil.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.248
Well, I think she's nice.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.463
There is something
she's hiding from us.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.470
Doesn't mean she deserves
your blue cheese dressing bomb.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.303
My best prank yet.

11:55.465 --> 11:58.139
Not hearing very well
increased my other senses.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.058
Don't worry, she never
comes into my room anyway.

12:05.892 --> 12:06.939
Do you have a sec?

12:07.352 --> 12:09.104
Yes.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.863
I was going through the basement

12:11.022 --> 12:15.277
and I found somethings
that I thought you might wanna have.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.914
Mom.

12:24.494 --> 12:29.671
I know you miss your mom
and I could never replace her.

12:30.792 --> 12:35.343
I just would really like it
if maybe we could be friends?

12:35.505 --> 12:38.429
Mom always said
she loved my practical jokes.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.686
I love your practical jokes.
I think you're hilarious.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.061
You think I'm funny?

12:43.221 --> 12:45.315
The one you did last month
to your father

12:45.473 --> 12:48.568
when you filled his toothpaste
with blueberry filling?

12:48.726 --> 12:51.195
And his teeth were blue
for like four days.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.152
That was epic.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.988
I hooked up his nose hair clipper

12:56.150 --> 12:57.823
- to a power saw?

12:57.986 --> 12:59.784
Some of my best work.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.369
Or the baby powder
in the hair dryer trick?

13:06.869 --> 13:09.463
I had meant that prank for you.

13:10.373 --> 13:11.875
I know.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.468
I'm sorry.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.629
It's OK. It was just a joke.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.548
There's something, um...

13:20.091 --> 13:22.014
...I would like you to have.

13:23.261 --> 13:27.732
This is something my parents gave me
when I was around your age.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.814
And my mother said
it would always protect me,

13:30.977 --> 13:33.150
even in my darkest hour.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.815
What I think she meant by that was,

13:35.982 --> 13:39.156
I would always have
her love and support.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.285
You're really giving this to me?

13:43.448 --> 13:47.203
It's something that's
very special to me and my family

13:47.368 --> 13:49.791
and I want you to have it...

13:50.913 --> 13:54.884
...because you're so very special.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.091
Rebecca. _ _

13:57.253 --> 14:00.223
...I'm really looking forward
to us being friends.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.266
MS, too.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.761
Good night.

14:18.733 --> 14:19.780
Marissa, wait!

14:32.705 --> 14:34.378
I'm so...

14:35.500 --> 14:36.672
...sorry.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.641
Good going.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.436
I tried to warn her!

14:47.053 --> 14:48.646
You got to make it up to her.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.149
Why do I have to be the one
to always apologize?

14:51.307 --> 14:54.277
Like what about that time that you
just kept on talking and I was...

14:57.480 --> 14:59.858
I turned off my hearing aids.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.328
OK! I'll make it up to her!

15:13.246 --> 15:14.589
He's right, you know.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.000
I mean, the show is called Spy Hunter.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.669
At some point,
I should actually catch a spy.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.179
He thinks I'm a complete loser.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.590
That's not what he meant.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.009
They just wanna spend
more time with you.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.644
What is that smell?

15:28.803 --> 15:30.350
Oh, did the baby spit up on you again?

15:30.513 --> 15:32.015
- Something like that.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.650
...Our worst fears have been confirmed.

15:34.809 --> 15:38.939
According to scientists, there are now,
literally, less hours in the day.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.325
Studies show that time is running out.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.450
Time is speeding up.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.453
At first, we were losing nanoseconds,
but now we're losing hours.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.957
By tomorrow, we'll have lost days.
By the day after that, a year.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.871
At this rate, we will be
completely out of time... in no time.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.539
Experts are divided
on what's causing this phenomenon,

15:56.706 --> 16:01.678
although one man has claimed credit.
We received this video moments ago.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.838
Citizens of the world,

16:04.005 --> 16:08.806
I find you all guilty of wasting time.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.939
You fill your days
with meaningless pursuits

16:13.097 --> 16:17.273
instead of treasuring moments
with those you love.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.063
You will no longer
take time for granted,

16:20.229 --> 16:25.201
for I am taking all
of the time in the world from you.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.158
Project Armageddon
has been activated

16:28.321 --> 16:33.623
and I will continue to speed up time
until time runs out,

16:33.784 --> 16:36.537
and the world will end.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.082
I am the Time Keeper

16:39.248 --> 16:43.594
and I want more time!

16:43.753 --> 16:47.223
Only minutes ago, OSS Director
Danger D'Amo addressed the threat.

16:47.381 --> 16:51.056
The OSS will find this Time Keeper,
and when we do,

16:51.219 --> 16:52.892
we will punch his clock.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.603
There 's a decrease of one minute
per hour as now...

16:59.227 --> 17:00.570
Oh, this is not good.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.355
Actually, this is awesome.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.273
Could you imagine
the promotion I would get

17:04.440 --> 17:07.284
if I landed an interview with this guy,
the Time Holder?

17:07.443 --> 17:09.444
- Time Keeper.
- Not to mention the hero factor

17:09.612 --> 17:13.207
for tracking down an international
supervillain. Not too shabby.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.915
Honey, I think being a hero isn't really
what the kids need from you right now.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.954
It's just what they need now.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.123
It's what the world needs.

17:24.919 --> 17:28.890
Where is the Chronos Sapphire
you promised me?

17:29.048 --> 17:32.177
Time waits for no man, no man but me.

17:32.343 --> 17:35.187
That one little rock
is the only element

17:35.346 --> 17:37.974
that can stop the Armageddon device.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.438
Trust me, it will be ours.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.820
Time and my temper are short.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.947
You waste my time...

17:46.148 --> 17:47.900
...and I'll waste you.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.042
We will find the Chronos Sapphire...

17:56.659 --> 17:57.751
...and when we do...

17:59.161 --> 18:01.835
...no one will be able to stop us.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.927
NO One.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.849
OK, princess.
You're a little sleepy head, huh?

18:16.887 --> 18:18.184
Oh, no.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.199
OSS directive. For your eyes only.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.325
Time Keeper threat confirmed.

18:30.484 --> 18:34.159
Chronos Sapphire
needed to stop Armageddon.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.326
Deliver Chronos to OSS immediately.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.702
Oh, Rebecca.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.292
I hope you're working on that apology.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.584
Make sure you write
"P.S., Cecil is innocent."

18:46.125 --> 18:47.422
A handmade coupon,

18:47.585 --> 18:50.680
good for one free month
of all household chores.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.058
And no pranks for a whole month.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.641
"And no pranks for a week."

19:00.097 --> 19:01.064
Hey, Rebecca?

19:01.223 --> 19:04.318
Do you have that necklace
from last night?

19:04.477 --> 19:05.649
Yeah. Why?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.734
I was just wondering
if maybe I could, um...

19:08.397 --> 19:09.569
...maybe I can have it back?

19:10.733 --> 19:12.735
You want the necklace back?

19:12.902 --> 19:17.703
I realized it needs to be cleaned,
and, uh... you know, it's old.

19:17.865 --> 19:21.540
Oh, I get it.
You can't trust me with it.

19:22.286 --> 19:25.335
What happened to "This necklace
is so special, and so are you"?

19:25.498 --> 19:27.250
Am I supposed to pretend
that you really meant that?

19:27.416 --> 19:31.046
I just need the necklace back.
I can't really explain it right now.

19:31.879 --> 19:32.926
You can have it!

19:33.089 --> 19:35.683
I never wanted your
stupid necklace anyway.

19:36.384 --> 19:39.934
You only care about yourself!
You don't care about us at all!

19:48.979 --> 19:52.279
I have to go on an important mission,
I mean, errand.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.819
There are snacks in the fridge.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.828
I'll be back in ten minutes.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.330
Do you guys need anything?

20:01.951 --> 20:03.123
My mom.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.631
We'll be fine.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.379
Right.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.466
Argonaut.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.470
Watch the kids.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.736
House is now armed.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.867
Buckle up, baby.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.203
- All right.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.830
Let's go for a ride.

20:47.163 --> 20:50.508
Hey! I thought you
gave that back to Marissa.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.010
Wait till she looks in the box.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.384
Is that the Chronos Sapphire?
Without that, our goose is cooked.

20:59.550 --> 21:02.178
Give it to Mommy. Thank you, pumpkin.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.848
Here, give it to me.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.858
Another prank.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.157
- Baby food.
- I'm sorry.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.365
My stepdaughter is a little... upset.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.699
She has the necklace.

21:19.862 --> 21:22.536
- I can get it back.
- Chronos Sapphire can wait.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.371
Your old pallie Tick Tock
has just been made

21:24.533 --> 21:25.830
and you're the only one
that can scoop him up.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.961
Pop the clutch.
You're back on the clock.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.497
What about the Chronos?

21:29.663 --> 21:32.007
You nab Tick Tock,
he'll lead us to the Time Keeper.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.543
We don't need the Chronos.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.711
So Rebecca can keep the necklace.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.260
It would mean a lot if she could.

21:38.422 --> 21:41.642
OK. I'll do it.
I just have to go get my kids first.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.394
Those ankle biters'll be fine!

21:50.893 --> 21:54.067
This is Seeker 17. We have a lock
on the Chronos Sapphire.

21:54.230 --> 21:56.528
Repeat, we have found
the Chronos Sapphire.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.364
Prepare to breach the entrance.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.869
You really shouldn't do that.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.585
But if you're going to,
give her vampire teeth.

22:11.747 --> 22:15.047
subject to immediate attack.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.632
Please take shelter
in the panic room now.

22:17.795 --> 22:20.765
You're really stepping up your game
with these pranks.

22:20.923 --> 22:22.095
That's not my prank.

22:22.258 --> 22:25.262
subject to immediate attack.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.771
Take shelter in the panic room now.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.854
- Where's the panic room?
- Don't fall for it.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.691
This is obviously Marissa's
attempt to get me back.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.944
Take shelter in the panic room now.

22:38.107 --> 22:42.157
Oh, and if we don't, I suppose
something really terrible

22:42.319 --> 22:43.821
will happen to us.

22:51.453 --> 22:52.545
Scanning.

22:53.622 --> 22:58.128
Identity match.
Please enter the panic room now.

23:01.797 --> 23:05.142
- Enter the panic room now.
- Let's go, Rebecca.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.395
Enter the panic room now.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.856
Well, this is obviously the panic room.

23:19.023 --> 23:22.948
- Why?
- 'Cause it's a room, and I'm panicking.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.333
Hello, children.

23:29.491 --> 23:32.335
I had this panic room installed
when I married your father

23:32.494 --> 23:34.917
in the event that my work
ever put the family in danger.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.332
Her work?

23:36.498 --> 23:38.171
There 's something
I never told you about myself

23:38.334 --> 23:41.008
because it was a matter
of national security.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.506
I am a spy.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.471
Our stepmother's a spy?

23:46.634 --> 23:48.011
Impossible.

23:48.177 --> 23:49.770
She's not cool enough.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.024
Argonaut is an Advanced Robotic
Guardian Operative

23:58.187 --> 23:59.655
designed to protect you.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.156
I still think this is a prank.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.536
The dog is talking.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.874
Well, it's not the sort of thing
you'd miss, is it, really?

24:11.033 --> 24:16.039
A small, handsome dog talking with
an English accent, like James Bond.

24:23.837 --> 24:27.683
Anyway, I've been assigned
to protect you, so give me five.

24:28.384 --> 24:31.558
That's what cool people say, isn't it?
Anyway, let's shake hands.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.722
Hello. How do you do?

24:33.889 --> 24:37.063
Ah! Oh, no! I hate when that happens!
I am gonna need that back.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.193
I think you better keep it
in sentry mode.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.824
any time you're ready.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.906
- Good thinking.

24:46.068 --> 24:48.116
Can I have it back now?
'Cause I am gonna fall over.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.920
The panic room is being attacked.

25:00.082 --> 25:01.550
You must leave now.

25:02.292 --> 25:05.011
The jet luges will take you
to OSS headquarters.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.047
And sit. Do you get it?

25:07.214 --> 25:09.308
It's what humans usually say to dogs.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.472
I reversed it, I flipped it.

25:13.095 --> 25:14.312
Oh, this is gonna be great.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.063
- I tell you, we're gonna have a...

25:21.687 --> 25:25.942
I usually have to eat grass
or a slipper to feel this sick. Oh.

25:26.108 --> 25:29.157
I wasn't ready, that's all.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

25:46.587 --> 25:49.511
Do not let the
Chronos Sapphire get away!

25:54.970 --> 25:56.847
A mini camera is not
that impressive any more.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.016
People have them in their phones.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.314
Well, how small is it?

26:02.227 --> 26:04.821
- That's impossible.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.657
Sorry. What?

26:09.068 --> 26:10.991
Sorry, there was an air show
behind me.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.372
There's no such thing
as invisibility powder.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.249
All right, Argonaut. Start talking.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.287
Who were those guys with the
giant goggles? What do they want?

26:19.453 --> 26:20.875
How long has Marissa been a spy?

26:21.038 --> 26:24.087
OK. Your stepmom will answer
all of your questions post-mission.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.672
I have a question.
Who's flying this thing?

26:27.002 --> 26:28.128
I thought you were.

26:28.295 --> 26:31.174
Oh, no.
They do not look like pet lovers.

26:31.340 --> 26:35.686
Hello, children. if you're watching
this, your escape jets are under attack.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.938
We are going to have to initiate
evasive maneuvers

26:38.097 --> 26:40.316
to get you to OSS even faster.

26:40.474 --> 26:41.851
- Brace yourselves.
- Oh, great.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.034
It's like a big video game.

26:51.193 --> 26:54.697
Grab your controller and steer slowly!

26:54.863 --> 26:57.867
- Whoa!
- I'm gonna crash!

27:00.577 --> 27:01.829
I'm gonna hurl.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.214
Right.
Puke goes in the bag, not on my fur.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.133
They're gaining!

27:23.058 --> 27:24.731
Cecil!

27:25.227 --> 27:26.820
Do something!

27:26.979 --> 27:28.981
He is doing something. He's puking.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.570
We might need a bigger bag.

27:30.732 --> 27:32.734
In fact, we might
need a bigger spaceship.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.745
It smells like fish socks in here.
Can we at least open a window?

27:35.904 --> 27:38.453
Ugh. it's not much fun in here.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.831
Hey! You opened up mine!

27:41.994 --> 27:44.838
Fresh air. That helps.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.967
I love this. I love sticking my head
out the window. it's my favorite thing.

28:07.269 --> 28:08.521
Sorry!

28:08.687 --> 28:11.691
Cecil!
How may puke bags do you have left?

28:29.958 --> 28:31.710
Good job, Cecil!

28:32.294 --> 28:35.468
Never underestimate the power of puke.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.769
Agent Argonaut reporting.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.851
Listen, the kids are fine.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.765
I can't say the same about the house.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.354
Why? What did they do?

28:46.516 --> 28:49.315
They didn't do anything. They didn't
destroy the house. Tick Tock's men did.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.697
What?! Argonaut,
I told you to watch them!

28:51.855 --> 28:54.153
I am watching them.
I'm watching them puke and scream.

28:54.316 --> 28:57.286
- We've gotta discuss hazard pay.
- Just get them to the OSS.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.491
I want a raise!

28:58.946 --> 29:00.994
There's only one person
I want waiting there to greet them.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.284
OSS Headquarters.
How can I direct your call?

29:03.450 --> 29:05.999
I saved your life. One point for me.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.664
Whatever. The puke bags were my idea.

29:08.830 --> 29:11.583
everything? You're brother and sister.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.593
You're fighting like cats and dogs,

29:13.752 --> 29:16.005
which I could understand
why cats and dogs fight.

29:16.171 --> 29:19.015
Cats are awful. Just chillax.

29:19.174 --> 29:23.304
Part "chill," part "relax."
I fused 'em to make a trendy word.

29:38.318 --> 29:39.535
Who are you?

29:39.695 --> 29:42.869
Carmen Cortez,
secret agent of the OSS.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.705
Your stepmom is my aunt.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.460
So, a word of caution to you
would-be supervillains out there...

29:50.622 --> 29:54.923
Your best defense may be...
a jelly donut.

29:56.586 --> 29:58.304
What am I saying?
What are they gonna do with that?

29:58.463 --> 30:00.682
What, are they gonna
throw them at 'em?

30:01.675 --> 30:04.224
Just say it. I'm too attractive.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.187
Let's face it.

30:06.346 --> 30:09.145
I've never caught a spy,
and I probably never will.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.152
I say we go after the Time Keeper.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.733
Oh, that's realistic.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.068
Where are you at with
that piece for Spy Week?

30:16.231 --> 30:17.403
It's not due till Friday.

30:17.566 --> 30:18.909
It is Friday.

30:19.067 --> 30:21.695
Time's speeding up, Wilson.
Don't you keep up with the news?

30:24.239 --> 30:26.241
Get me something on someone, anyone!

30:26.408 --> 30:27.500
And get it to me yesterday

30:27.659 --> 30:30.458
or there won't be a tomorrow
for you at the station. Got it?

30:35.459 --> 30:37.427
It's time to get serious.

30:38.754 --> 30:41.883
Marissa's not picking up.
Maybe she's under radio silence.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.222
She's got a lot
of explaining to do, man.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.762
She never told you she was a spy, huh?

30:47.471 --> 30:49.724
Well, in her defense, she was retired.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.860
- Well, hello.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.363
You're a big girl now.
Is that titanium alloy?

30:56.521 --> 30:58.273
- Treat?
- Yes, please.

31:04.321 --> 31:05.618
Cool.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.211
Wanna see how I got started as a spy?

31:20.462 --> 31:23.841
This is the old Spy Kids division.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.109
ago due to budget cuts.

31:34.267 --> 31:37.862
Really sad. It was ahead of its time.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.909
Spy Kids were an elite
juvenile division of the OSS.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.321
I'm going to explode you.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.535
Established to go where
adult spies couldn't go

31:47.697 --> 31:50.325
and do what ordinary spies
couldn't do.

31:50.492 --> 31:53.291
Ralphie, it's me!
We went to the academy together.

31:53.453 --> 31:54.420
How you do...

31:54.579 --> 31:58.800
Oh. Now I see what, they've turned
him off. Just as well. He's annoying.

31:58.959 --> 32:01.462
I'd like to bring back
the Spy Kids division one day.

32:03.380 --> 32:06.304
We call those Stompers
and Hammer Hands.

32:06.466 --> 32:10.016
They use electron fields
to create superhuman impact force.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.725
These SFS 3WeSOI'T1€.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.606
You can crush things.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.605
on-the-spot booby traps

32:19.771 --> 32:23.617
ambushes, mass confusion,
and pranks.

32:24.526 --> 32:26.244
- Pranks?
- I'll tell you what.

32:26.403 --> 32:29.122
I'll let you guys pick out
one gadget each as a souvenir.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.874
- Mine.
- Mine.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.751
Don't get too excited. I said that
I'd let you guys pick out e gadget,

32:33.910 --> 32:35.457
but I didn't say I'd activate it.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.214
Back in the day,
the kids who made the best spies

32:38.373 --> 32:41.001
were the ones who didn't wait around
for the perfect gadgets.

32:41.168 --> 32:44.297
They made stuff happen
with what they had on hand.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.181
Who's that?

32:54.681 --> 32:56.683
Me and my brother, Juni.

32:56.850 --> 33:00.150
We were the first and last
of the Spy Kids program.

33:02.272 --> 33:05.446
We shall not speak of him. Let's go.

33:07.027 --> 33:10.247
And this is where our grand tour ends.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.533
Wait here. Marissa will
pick you guys up in a minute.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.202
Can we be candidates
for the new Spy Kids program?

33:15.368 --> 33:18.087
Time will tell. Sorry, guys, gotta go.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.499
OSS has us working around the clock.

33:21.082 --> 33:25.588
We have to stop the Time Keeper
before the Time Keeper stops time.

33:25.754 --> 33:29.224
much of a villain's name, is it?

33:29.382 --> 33:31.680
Oh, the Time Keeper.
Has he got a watch, has he?

33:31.843 --> 33:34.062
It's not a scary name at all.

33:34.221 --> 33:35.564
Rubbish.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.510
your destination for this mission.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.137
Good luck, agent.

34:07.295 --> 34:10.094
So Tick Tock attacked our house

34:10.257 --> 34:12.510
and chased after your
brother and sister.

34:13.134 --> 34:14.476
What do you think we should do?

34:14.636 --> 34:16.013
Annihilate.

34:16.929 --> 34:20.560
Annihilate?
Good thinking.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.978
to the big-time, agent. Suit up.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.897
Intel places Tick Tock at this location.

34:26.063 --> 34:29.989
Spot him and let him lead us to
the Time Keeper's Armageddon device.

34:30.150 --> 34:32.995
Then call in and wait for backup.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.960
I need you at six o'clock, right here.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.501
Come on! Bring it in.

34:45.667 --> 34:48.386
The Armageddon device
will be here any minute

34:48.545 --> 34:51.969
and we must be ready for its arrival!

34:52.465 --> 34:53.637
Uh, cover the exit.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.848
There you go. Good work.

34:56.011 --> 34:58.184
Focus up, focus. Focus!

34:58.346 --> 35:00.815
What are you doing?
We're moments away.

35:00.974 --> 35:03.648
My plan is almost complete.

35:03.810 --> 35:07.656
I just need to get the Chronos
back from those meddlesome kids.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.584
Shh...

35:21.411 --> 35:24.381
Oh! Are you kidding me? Is that you?

35:24.539 --> 35:26.382
Did you drop your transmission?

35:26.541 --> 35:29.044
Oh, my God. Gentlemen, please.

35:29.210 --> 35:32.134
That smells like lentils
and desperation.

35:32.297 --> 35:35.722
My God, that's mental.
It's following you.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.512
Get back on your marks. Focus.

35:38.678 --> 35:41.557
I'm blinded. OW!

35:41.973 --> 35:44.647
It's here, it's here. it's finally here.

35:44.809 --> 35:50.066
Places, everyone. This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.569
Right on time.

35:54.736 --> 35:57.535
Hickory-dickory dock.

35:57.697 --> 36:00.416
The spy ran up the clock.

36:00.575 --> 36:04.250
The clock struck one,
and the spy was done.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.585
Game, set, and match, Tick Tock.

36:06.748 --> 36:09.922
Wait a minute. Hold on.

36:10.085 --> 36:13.089
This is your sidekick?
A nose-picking baby?

36:13.254 --> 36:15.256
Gentlemen, get in here.

36:15.715 --> 36:18.594
Baby, looks like we've been set up.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.558
Finish her. Boom.

36:21.763 --> 36:22.514
Boom.

36:37.904 --> 36:40.748
Better luck next time!

36:43.952 --> 36:47.832
The bigger the crime,
the better the time!

36:48.456 --> 36:51.630
He is really starting to tick me off.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.883
J" Ten green bottles hanging on a wall

36:58.049 --> 37:00.973
J" Ten green bottles hanging on a wall

37:01.136 --> 37:03.559
J* And if one green bottle
should accidentally fall J'

37:03.722 --> 37:05.724
I'm still mad at Stepmother...

37:05.890 --> 37:07.312
Marissa.

37:07.475 --> 37:09.853
...For not telling us she was a spy.

37:10.019 --> 37:11.441
For not telling Dad.

37:11.604 --> 37:14.608
Maybe she quit
to make more time for us.

37:14.774 --> 37:15.900
Yeah, right.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.570
Well, wouldn't you wanna be a spy?

37:19.821 --> 37:21.243
I will be.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.704
Even better spy than Marissa.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.161
What are you up to?

37:26.911 --> 37:31.257
Carmen said that the best Spy Kids
were the ones who didn't wait around.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.134
They went out and made stuff happen.

37:33.293 --> 37:35.671
It would have to be
something really amazing.

37:36.921 --> 37:40.141
- Like catching the Time Keeper?
- Bad idea.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.803
First person to get the bad guy wins.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.812
No. Not another competi...

37:44.971 --> 37:48.145
What part of "chillax"
don't you understand?

37:48.725 --> 37:49.726
Game on.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.195
Aw, man!

37:56.357 --> 37:59.281
This Electric Shock Gumball
doesn't work, either.

38:00.445 --> 38:04.325
While you're chewing gum over there,
I'm hacking into my Hammer Hands.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.585
- I think I got it!

38:10.705 --> 38:13.174
- OW!

38:17.879 --> 38:18.880
Why?

38:24.260 --> 38:26.388
I just don't understand.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.807
It says batteries are included.

38:29.766 --> 38:31.018
Read the fine print.

38:31.184 --> 38:33.232
"On and off button...

38:33.394 --> 38:34.816
...not included."

38:35.146 --> 38:36.614
Let's get out of here.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.697
Good idea.

38:45.490 --> 38:46.491
- Hey!
- Hey!

38:47.826 --> 38:51.080
What are you kids doing? You don't
have security clearance to be out here.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.214
Um... We lost our dog.

38:54.916 --> 38:57.419
Yeah, but we just found him. See?

38:57.585 --> 39:00.839
Hello. I mean, bark.
I mean, woof, woof.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.757
- Definitely, I meant...

39:02.924 --> 39:06.178
Yeah, they're not falling for it.
Looks we're all in this together now.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.937
Run!

39:08.555 --> 39:10.432
- Hey!
- Hey! Stop right there!

39:10.598 --> 39:13.192
Coming through. Nice shoes.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.653
- Oh!
- Sorry, sorry.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.774
Stop those kids!

39:20.316 --> 39:22.614
- We'll never outrun them!

39:22.777 --> 39:24.871
Yes, we will! Pull my collar!

39:25.405 --> 39:27.954
- Oil slick.

39:36.249 --> 39:37.296
Uh-oh.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.964
- They're still after us!
- Pull my tail.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.554
Butt bombs.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.898
This is the coolest dog ever!

39:56.060 --> 39:58.939
That's an award and I accept it.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.704
Wait, wait, one more. One more.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.908
Pull my finger.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.457
Do it.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.804
- Wait for it.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.184
What was that supposed to do?

40:28.343 --> 40:29.686
It just makes me laugh.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.515
Silent but lethal.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.564
How are we gonna
find the Time Keeper?

40:37.727 --> 40:40.697
I don't know, if it was that hard
just getting out of the lounge.

40:40.855 --> 40:45.031
Organism Oscillation Transporter...

40:45.193 --> 40:48.072
...otherwise known as TOOT.

40:48.780 --> 40:52.375
Carmen said not to rely on our gadgets,
but to use our heads.

40:53.368 --> 40:55.416
Argonaut, what do you know
about the Time Keeper?

40:55.578 --> 40:57.376
First, type in my passcode.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.040
Double-0-Woof.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.093
They've intercepted
several coded messages

41:02.251 --> 41:03.719
as to the Time Keeper's location.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.506
But no one's been able
to crack the code.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.179
It's not a code. it's an anagram.

41:09.342 --> 41:10.719
Drop all the numbers,

41:10.885 --> 41:14.355
switch all the letters around,
and it spells something else.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.063
"Big Time Watch Repair Shop"?

41:17.225 --> 41:20.479
The bad guy is holding the
world hostage from a watch shop?

41:20.645 --> 41:22.522
Well, he is called the Time Keeper.

41:22.689 --> 41:25.863
Villains do love their
secret hideouts to have a theme.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.993
to the Time Keeper's shop

41:28.152 --> 41:30.120
without having to leave the building.

41:35.076 --> 41:37.078
You better not disintegrate us.

41:39.914 --> 41:43.259
- I think that's sort of the point.
- What?

41:43.418 --> 41:46.171
They took the Chronos Sapphire.
Don't let them get away!

41:49.590 --> 41:52.013
You vaporized us!

41:57.181 --> 41:59.149
I've lost face.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.734
Something stinks around here.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.071
I always knew you were a butthead.

42:08.276 --> 42:11.780
I'd give you a knuckle sandwich
if I knew where my knuckles were!

42:23.124 --> 42:25.673
Oh, I think my stomach is inside out.

42:25.835 --> 42:27.803
I think I'm missing a kidney.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.306
I'm just pulling your leg.

42:35.303 --> 42:37.522
- Brilliant.
- A comedian.

42:40.683 --> 42:42.936
- Marissa's on the line.
- Marissa?

42:44.979 --> 42:46.481
- Hello?
- Give Mommy the comlink.

42:46.647 --> 42:48.695
There we go. Thank you.

42:50.151 --> 42:52.950
Sorry, technical difficulties, Carmen.
How are the kids?

42:53.529 --> 42:54.781
They're, uh...

42:54.947 --> 42:55.948
...lnapping?

42:56.115 --> 42:58.994
OK. Where are they really?

42:59.577 --> 43:03.457
I'm really sorry. They TOOTED
themselves out of the OSS.

43:03.623 --> 43:05.967
Send me their coordinates.
I'll meet you there.

43:06.793 --> 43:08.636
You know, she's a lot like you, Carmen.

43:08.795 --> 43:11.765
That's what I'm afraid of.

43:20.807 --> 43:22.684
Are you sure this is the place?

43:22.850 --> 43:25.228
He's called the Time Keeper.

43:25.394 --> 43:28.022
This is a room full of clocks.

43:28.189 --> 43:30.783
Nah, let's go, let's check out
that cheese shop across the road.

43:30.942 --> 43:32.535
It's another anagram.

43:32.693 --> 43:35.412
Switch all those letters around
and what do they spell?

43:37.865 --> 43:39.583
- Elevator.

43:43.162 --> 43:44.835
This must be the access panel.

43:44.997 --> 43:47.216
- Oops.

43:50.878 --> 43:53.631
- You could help, genius.
- And risk losing?

43:58.177 --> 44:00.976
before we call you the winner.

44:01.139 --> 44:04.814
You should have a competition to see
which one of you is the most annoying.

44:15.403 --> 44:17.701
All my own stunts, all my own stunts.

44:23.744 --> 44:26.748
And it's... a giant clock.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.473
So, what's...

44:41.679 --> 44:43.352
_..that?

44:43.514 --> 44:45.983
the cut-you-in-half hand.

44:58.696 --> 45:01.495
- Well, I'm going home.
- There's a door over there!

45:03.117 --> 45:04.790
So?

45:04.952 --> 45:08.126
First person to get across
without getting smushed...

45:08.831 --> 45:10.128
...wins.

45:13.878 --> 45:16.051
Now, listen, just because
one person jumps off a cliff,

45:16.214 --> 45:17.887
it doesn't mean you have
to follow them. Does it?

45:18.633 --> 45:19.759
Oh, it does, apparently.

45:20.468 --> 45:22.220
Brilliant. Here we go again.

45:23.638 --> 45:26.141
Here comes the cut-you-in-half hand!

45:26.307 --> 45:28.810
- Jump!
- I'll duck, thank you very much.

45:29.143 --> 45:30.486
Whoa!

45:33.439 --> 45:34.986
There's gotta be
a better way to pass the time.

45:35.149 --> 45:38.119
It's moving faster!

45:38.277 --> 45:40.279
That's because time is speeding up!

45:41.989 --> 45:45.163
Listen, I was told to watch you kids,
but not watch you die!

45:47.245 --> 45:49.339
Cecil! Hang on!

45:49.497 --> 45:51.340
Now this is fun to watch.

46:00.383 --> 46:02.977
- You OK?
- Yeah.

46:03.135 --> 46:06.560
I win.
One point for me.

46:08.849 --> 46:11.523
- OW.
- Come on. This way.

46:15.815 --> 46:19.240
- Hey... Hey, it's working!

46:19.402 --> 46:21.029
Sweet.

46:21.195 --> 46:23.914
I Spy 8 SPY-

46:24.699 --> 46:26.167
Go get the camera.

46:27.243 --> 46:28.836
It's show time.

46:32.164 --> 46:34.041
My five-year plan is coming together.

46:34.208 --> 46:36.210
This is my big break.

46:36.377 --> 46:40.848
Now we just build on this success
and maybe someday hit primetime.

46:41.007 --> 46:45.057
Primetime means free time...
to spend with my kids.

46:45.219 --> 46:48.268
Great plan. Only in five years,
they won't be kids any more.

46:49.223 --> 46:50.349
What are you saying?

46:50.516 --> 46:52.234
Spend the time now.

46:52.393 --> 46:54.816
'Cause the one thing
you'll always find time for later...

46:55.938 --> 46:57.155
...is regret.

47:04.447 --> 47:05.573
Jeez.

47:06.198 --> 47:09.077
cut in half for a computer?

47:11.537 --> 47:14.165
- There's a lot here about...

47:15.041 --> 47:16.759
"The Boy Trapped In Time."

47:16.917 --> 47:20.421
And that's gonna happen to us
if we don't stop the Time Keeper.

47:20.588 --> 47:23.091
According to this, he was part
of a time travel experiment.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.980
People sure did talk funny back then.

47:33.434 --> 47:36.529
Test Footage, 1936.

47:36.687 --> 47:41.989
Chronos Sapphire, discovered
to be the only known element

47:42.151 --> 47:44.745
able to stop the Armageddon device."

47:45.446 --> 47:47.744
- We have to get out of here!
- What's wrong?

47:48.324 --> 47:49.871
They're after the necklace!

48:01.295 --> 48:03.263
That'll stop your clock.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.937
Watch your head!

48:14.558 --> 48:16.981
Oops! Sorry about that.

48:17.144 --> 48:20.614
Well, the good news is, you're tall
enough to go on all the rides.

48:28.823 --> 48:31.793
You children think you have
all the time in the world,

48:31.951 --> 48:33.453
but soon I will.

48:33.619 --> 48:35.212
Hand over the necklace.

48:39.583 --> 48:42.462
found a more secret lair.

48:43.462 --> 48:45.715
- What?

48:47.925 --> 48:49.177
Leave my kids alone.

48:49.343 --> 48:50.640
Stepkids.

48:50.803 --> 48:53.352
Shh! She's here to save us.

48:53.514 --> 48:55.892
How dare you waste time
bickering about that?

48:56.058 --> 48:57.981
If you have no interest
in being a family,

48:58.144 --> 49:01.239
then you don't deserve
any time together.

49:01.397 --> 49:02.740
Well, he's right about one thing.

49:02.898 --> 49:06.072
If we're gonna get outta here,
we need to work as a family.

49:06.986 --> 49:08.033
Fire up your gadgets.

49:08.195 --> 49:09.447
They're not activated.

49:09.613 --> 49:11.615
- They're just souvenirs.
- Not any more.

49:25.087 --> 49:26.589
Hammer time.

49:44.315 --> 49:45.407
Cool.

49:57.620 --> 49:59.213
A watch shop?

50:00.998 --> 50:03.751
Slight left and proceed around building.

50:06.587 --> 50:08.180
Turn right now.

50:09.006 --> 50:10.599
Spy detected.

50:10.758 --> 50:12.931
- It's a dumpster.

50:13.093 --> 50:16.267
Walk forward now. Turn left now.

50:16.430 --> 50:19.650
Left foot, right foot,
left foot, big right foot.

50:19.808 --> 50:21.651
Center and stop.

50:21.810 --> 50:23.312
Proceed below.

50:23.479 --> 50:27.359
The annoying voice is saying
there's a spy right here. Look.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.778
- Proceed below now.

50:30.402 --> 50:33.121
This is more than a dumpster!

50:42.915 --> 50:45.464
- Sorry!
- It's OK! Do it again!

51:06.564 --> 51:09.067
Oh, shiitake mushrooms.

51:20.452 --> 51:22.671
Come here. Come here, come here.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.127
OK, ready?

51:24.290 --> 51:26.634
Wilbur Wilson, Spy Hunter here.

51:26.792 --> 51:29.261
As you can see, I'm in some
sort of underground secret lair

51:29.420 --> 51:31.047
where the battle
for freedom and justice

51:31.213 --> 51:33.341
is being fought
by our country's top spies.

51:33.507 --> 51:35.180
I really can't see much from up here

51:35.342 --> 51:38.937
but we can zoom in with our
Spy Hunt Cam and get a closer look.

51:39.096 --> 51:41.019
Oh, the kids are gonna flip
when they see this.

51:43.017 --> 51:45.315
Did you get that?
You got it? Go, go, go.

51:45.477 --> 51:47.195
Argonaut, do something!

51:47.354 --> 51:49.698
What do you want me to do?
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

51:55.070 --> 51:57.698
- Attack mode activated.

51:58.157 --> 51:59.454
It's show time!

52:08.208 --> 52:10.802
Oh, someone put that on YouTube!

52:14.089 --> 52:18.139
- Time flies when you're having fun.

52:25.392 --> 52:26.518
My necklace!

52:27.978 --> 52:29.446
Let's get the kids out of here!

52:33.025 --> 52:34.402
Argonaut!

52:34.943 --> 52:36.411
Release!

52:36.570 --> 52:39.198
Oh, come on!
I was gonna bury him in the backyard!

52:39.365 --> 52:43.461
Let them go. It's all part of the plan.

52:43.619 --> 52:46.543
We have the Chronos Sapphire.

52:46.705 --> 52:49.754
Nothing can stop us now.

52:56.256 --> 52:58.384
Sorry about the necklace, Marissa.

52:58.550 --> 53:00.268
"Sorry about the necklace, Marissa."

53:00.427 --> 53:01.929
I should've given it
back to you when you asked.

53:02.096 --> 53:03.097
Yes, you should've.

53:03.263 --> 53:05.516
We had no idea
the Time Keeper wanted it.

53:05.683 --> 53:07.105
"We're just dumb kids."

53:07.267 --> 53:09.941
You couldn't have known.
It was classified.

53:10.104 --> 53:12.573
The whole world's in big trouble.

53:12.731 --> 53:13.778
Don't look at me.

53:13.941 --> 53:15.033
It's all our fault.

53:15.192 --> 53:18.116
And I'm sorry I didn't share
with you that I was a spy.

53:18.278 --> 53:22.283
But it was important to me
that you were both protected and safe.

53:22.449 --> 53:24.918
What's important is
stopping the Time Keeper.

53:25.077 --> 53:26.454
Give us another chance.

53:26.620 --> 53:31.251
You two have been so very brave
and I'm so proud of you.

53:31.417 --> 53:34.421
That sounds like something
my mom would say.

53:38.424 --> 53:41.098
- They want us back for a debrief.
- Take the kids back to OSS.

53:41.260 --> 53:42.637
- I'll meet you there.
- Got it.

53:42.803 --> 53:44.680
Thanks for rescuing us.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.607
Any time.

53:49.727 --> 53:52.150
I used to get in trouble
like this all the time.

53:52.938 --> 53:55.157
Hi, sweetheart. Sorry I missed you.
Great news!

53:55.315 --> 53:59.036
I got the most amazing footage of
a real spy battle at the watch shop!

53:59.194 --> 54:02.494
I'm gonna put it
on the air tonight, primetime!

54:02.656 --> 54:03.908
- The kids are gonna be so proud.
- Oh, no.

54:04.074 --> 54:06.497
Love you, miss you, need you. Bye!
Call me back!

54:10.122 --> 54:11.749
That's great!

54:12.416 --> 54:14.839
We're gonna win an Emmy for this.
A Pulitzer.

54:15.002 --> 54:17.801
Whoa, go back, go back.
Does she have a baby with her?

54:18.338 --> 54:20.716
Oh, she does! Oh, that's priceless!

54:20.883 --> 54:24.308
OK, we're gonna need a graphic
that reads "Spies Are Unfit Moms."

54:24.470 --> 54:27.440
And, Wilbur, see if you can get a quote
from Child Protective Services.

54:27.598 --> 54:30.522
If we're lucky, they'll take the
kids away, put 'em in foster care! Yeah!

54:30.684 --> 54:32.436
- Whoo-hoo!

54:34.188 --> 54:36.532
- Wilbur!
- Sorry. I'm a Klutz.

54:36.690 --> 54:39.364
It's all right. I've got the original
tape right here.

54:40.694 --> 54:43.288
Hm!

54:43.614 --> 54:45.958
Tastes like chicken! Want some?

54:47.367 --> 54:48.414
Out!

54:59.880 --> 55:01.177
Oh, really? Great.

55:02.007 --> 55:03.384
Hi, honey.

55:04.176 --> 55:08.898
Don't "honey" me.
There's no "honey"ing any more.

55:09.056 --> 55:10.558
- You're a spy!

55:10.724 --> 55:14.069
- You found out.
- Well, I'm a Spy Hunter.

55:14.228 --> 55:16.697
And apparently I'm not a very good one,
since I've been living with one.

55:16.855 --> 55:19.904
I retired the day we had the baby...

55:20.901 --> 55:24.371
...because our family is the most
important thing in the world to me.

55:24.530 --> 55:25.998
And...

55:26.156 --> 55:28.033
...I'm so sorry.

55:28.200 --> 55:31.249
Wow. I feel like such a fool.

55:31.954 --> 55:33.581
Why did you marry me?

55:33.747 --> 55:36.500
- You must've lost a bet, right?
- You're the man I love.

55:36.667 --> 55:39.841
Well, uh, now I'm the man without a job

55:40.003 --> 55:42.347
and maybe without a family.

55:43.423 --> 55:44.720
Where are the kids?

55:45.133 --> 55:48.307
They're under protective
surveillance at the OSS.

55:49.304 --> 55:52.433
They're probably safer there anyway.

55:52.599 --> 55:54.442
I mean, their own dad
can't protect them.

55:56.603 --> 55:58.276
Just tell them I love them.

56:00.065 --> 56:01.863
What about us?

56:02.276 --> 56:03.869
I just...

56:04.403 --> 56:05.700
...need time.

56:19.918 --> 56:22.387
We 're all running out of time.

56:22.546 --> 56:25.220
Some predicted it would
come in a blaze of fire,

56:25.382 --> 56:29.103
a giant flood, but it was the
ancient Mayans who got it right

56:29.261 --> 56:32.265
when they predicted en end
to the human calender,

56:32.431 --> 56:34.479
the end of time itself

56:34.641 --> 56:37.895
Can anyone save us from this
impending apocalypse,

56:38.061 --> 56:40.063
this final doomsday, this...

56:42.482 --> 56:43.825
Armageddon.

56:43.984 --> 56:47.614
Also known as the Wells Experiment.

56:47.779 --> 56:49.952
Back in the day, this contraption

56:50.115 --> 56:52.083
almost caused the end
of the world as we know it.

56:52.242 --> 56:54.791
That's why the OSS
shut the experiment down

56:54.953 --> 56:59.379
and placed the device in Level 13
lockdown, where it remains today.

56:59.541 --> 57:01.339
The fate of the world
is on the line here.

57:01.501 --> 57:06.348
That's why I'm calling upon one of our
most valued and skilled operatives,

57:06.506 --> 57:08.179
Agent Cortez.

57:10.010 --> 57:13.355
He has even come out
of retirement to help us.

57:21.647 --> 57:22.990
Yeah!

57:41.667 --> 57:45.137
- It's good to be back.
- Then you never should have left.

57:45.295 --> 57:46.888
Where have you been
the last seven years?

57:47.047 --> 57:49.721
If I told you, then it wouldn't
be called a secret mission.

57:49.883 --> 57:53.353
It's not like I missed you or anything.
I needed a break from your face.

57:53.512 --> 57:56.140
Oh, what an incredible coincidence.

57:56.306 --> 57:58.559
- I needed a break from yours.
- Oh, whatever.

57:59.017 --> 58:00.394
What's going on over there?

58:03.563 --> 58:05.691
Family reunion.

58:06.191 --> 58:07.943
- This isn't about us.
- Gosh.

58:08.110 --> 58:11.410
Carmen, this is about saving the world.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.495
- You don't deserve to wear this badge.
- Uh...

58:17.577 --> 58:19.170
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

58:19.329 --> 58:22.458
All right, agents.
Let's make sure there is a tomorrow.

58:23.542 --> 58:26.591
- Let's go save the world!

58:26.753 --> 58:30.098
What do we get to do?
What's our assignment?

58:32.718 --> 58:34.516
Man! Why are we in time-out?

58:34.678 --> 58:38.308
We found the Time Keeper.
So, why are we grounded?

58:38.473 --> 58:41.101
And why do we have to watch the baby?

58:41.268 --> 58:42.815
Technically, I'm watching her.

58:42.978 --> 58:46.949
Sometimes you're the dog, sometimes
you're the baby entertainment center.

58:47.107 --> 58:49.075
Danger D'Amo, director of the OSS.

58:49.234 --> 58:51.862
I wanted to commend you
on your brave service.

58:52.029 --> 58:53.997
You bobbleheads really
take after your mom.

58:54.156 --> 58:56.204
Stepmom.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.036
Let me give you some advice, kiddo.

58:59.202 --> 59:01.455
Don't get balled up
over that kind of baloney.

59:01.621 --> 59:05.717
She takes the time to love you...
you love her back.

59:11.923 --> 59:14.301
- Nice watch.
- Thanks.

59:14.468 --> 59:15.890
It was a gift from my pops.

59:16.053 --> 59:19.102
- You sure talk funny.

59:20.390 --> 59:22.609
- Danger D'Amo.
- Yeah.

59:22.768 --> 59:25.317
Did you know your name
is an anagram?

59:27.314 --> 59:31.490
Switch the letters of your name around,
and it spells...

59:31.651 --> 59:33.073
...Armageddon

59:33.236 --> 59:35.204
As in the Armageddon device.

59:36.156 --> 59:38.033
Either that's a coincidence...

59:40.952 --> 59:45.173
...or that's just an
incredible coincidence.

59:49.669 --> 59:51.797
- You're ticking.

59:53.090 --> 59:54.307
It's an old watch.

59:54.466 --> 59:57.436
- But you're wearing three more.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.441
You're the Time Keeper.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.481
Yeah. I'd love to stick around
and chat but time is running out.

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:17.202
The head of the good guys is
actually the head of the bad guys?

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:20.575
I did not see that coming.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.873
Look around for a comlink or a phone!

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.042
We have to warn Marissa!

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.977
Agent Wilson.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.357
- Turn around!
- It's a trap!

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:47.645
- That's his secret identity!

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:51.315
Look, I don't have time
for your pranks right now. OK?

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.576
Watch Argonaut watch the baby.
Thank you.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.591
- The Armageddon device.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:14.054
It's tiny.

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:24.435
If time's the test, family is best.

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:26.066
It's a trap.

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:30.274
Hello, agents. You're right on time.

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:36.367
The kids were right.

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:42.199
...who you thought I was.

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:45.209
So where's the
real Armageddon device?

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:48.292
Back at the OSS,
where it's always been.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:49.877
And now...

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.046
...I must get back to it.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:54.962
- What's that?

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.471
A really nice watch.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:59.429
It's also a freeze transmitter

01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:01.593
for all agents at the OSS.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:04.141
It's time to take out the competition.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.200
Danger, don't.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:23.415
Now... to stop the world.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.183
Why didn't I freeze?

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:45.349
I'm... trapped in here.

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:48.181
I need reinforcements.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:51.192
But there are no reinforcements.
They're all frozen.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:54.362
Except...

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:59.526
Time has run out for most of the planet.

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:01.570
Eighteen time zones have been frozen

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:04.205
by the Time Keeper's
Armageddon device.

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:07.038
One thing's for certain...
it's heading our way.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.202
But we must not lose hope.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:12.877
Who are we kidding? It's over!
We 're toast!

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:18.178
Attention, Spy Kids.
You have been activated.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:21.510
I repeat, you have been activated.

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.259
Is he talking to us?

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:27.350
At this very moment, the Time Keeper
is taking over OSS Headquarters.

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:30.265
Your time has come to save the world.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.893
Every OSS agent has been frozen.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:36.359
It's up to you to shut down
the Armageddon device.

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:39.866
Get the necklace back.
It's the only thing that can stop him.

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:41.993
And how are we supposed to do that?

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:44.154
Spy Kids have always been able
to beat the bad guys

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:46.073
because adults over-think things.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:48.662
But to a kid, everything is possible.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:51.203
Trust me, I know.

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:54.122
Just use your imagination
and work with each other,

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.383
not against each other.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:59.420
So no more competing
against each other?

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:01.297
Good.

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:06.260
- Argonaut!
- Attack mode, por favor:

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:11.140
- Attack the door.
- Argo smash!

01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:15.106
What about the baby?

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.440
Spy Kids.

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:18.071
Spy Dog.

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:19.230
Spy Baby.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.617
activated as Spy Kids,

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.373
you are part of an elite team,

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:32.126
and we need to work together,
like Juni said.

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:33.958
No more competitions.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:37.382
We've got to break into the OSS vault,

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.213
get to the Time Keeper,

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.299
find the Chronos Sapphire,

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.634
then use it to stop
the Armageddon device,

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:46.300
and, of course, save the world.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:50.307
Cecil, you take the vault.
Rebecca, you're on pranks.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.599
And I, of course, will take
the toughest assignment of all...

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:55.688
I'll watch the baby.

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:01.023
So I realized the only way
he could freeze agents

01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:02.987
was through their OSS badges.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.321
There you go.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.578
Thanks for trashing mine, Carmen.

01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:10.157
Thanks, Juni. Unfreeze your sister.

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:12.496
OK, but first...

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:14.502
...this is how I remember you.

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:17.164
And there we go.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:18.297
- Juni!
- Hm?

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:19.799
Unfreeze her.

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.552
But it's so peaceful and quiet.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:24.759
There.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.970
This never would've happened
if I was mission leader.

01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:30.852
- I activated Rebecca and Cecil.
- What?

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.557
They're more ready than you think.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.770
If anything happens to those kids,
you're toast.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.025
This way.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:50.993
- Real smooth, diaper lady.

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:52.829
I was just following my instincts.

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:55.210
Well, your in-stinks!

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:58.167
You two were the best spy team ever.

01:05:58.329 --> 01:05:59.546
What happened?

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:01.504
Yeah.
Where have you been all these years?

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:05.512
I tried to strike out on my own,
and I struck out. OK?

01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:09.050
OK, but Mom and Dad left
the family business to the both of us.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:10.717
Yeah. Well...

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:15.060
I guess I thought it wasn't cool
to keep working with my sister.

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:18.391
It's what would've made you cool.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.651
Where's Marissa?

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.656
- It's quicksand!

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.165
Don't make me punch your lights out.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:56.392
Now you've seen my dark side.

01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:01.651
- Low battery?

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:12.654
"Don't rely on your gadgets."

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:21.458
Hmm...

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:30.005
Hello?

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:31.718
Is anyone in here?

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.642
You get the door open yet?

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:41.684
- I think we need another way in.

01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:43.647
OK. I'll be there in a minute.

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:53.278
You caught a kid.

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:11.846
Enjoy the ride!

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:18.348
Now what?

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:20.513
- We give up.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.808
it's the only way
we'll get the necklace back.

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:24.897
Just follow my lead.

01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:27.612
Hand over your weapons.

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:37.451
All of your weapons.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:55.180
OSS agents have been frozen in time.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.469
Is there someone, anyone,
out there that can save the day?

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:00.057
Hello, Wilbur

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:03.814
Yes, this is your dog, and I'm talking,
but never mind about that now.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.067
Rebecca and Cecil are in danger.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:08.899
They've been captured by the
Time Keeper and they need your help.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:13.363
I know it's hard to believe, sin
but you're their last hope.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.363
I 'd hurry if I were you.

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:26.473
What's with the jazz hands?
Huh, kiddies?

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:31.145
My brother's hearing impaired.
And your goon took his hearing aids.

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:33.984
Give him his hearing aids back.
We're not monsters here.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:38.656
No. You're only trying to end the world.

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.115
Why are you doing this?

01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:45.330
The Armageddon device was not
meant to end the world or stop time.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:48.540
It was meant to travel back in time.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:51.923
To get me back to that.

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:56.670
- My father.
- Son, come here! Take a look at this.

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:59.840
was an early attempt to time travel.

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:02.513
That's me before the accident.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:06.270
My father was working
on the original prototype.

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:10.350
They were just about to test
the machine when it went haywire.

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:15.359
He told me not to play near the lab.

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:20.785
But I never listened.

01:11:22.153 --> 01:11:25.953
It trapped me in time for
so many years I almost lost count.

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.785
You were the Boy Frozen In Time.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:31.959
My father spent his entire life...

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:33.964
...trying to set me free.

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:49.188
...and, eventually...

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:52.433
...die.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:55.694
The OSS shut down the experiment

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:59.232
with a solution
that literally fell from the sky...

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:00.991
...the Chronos Sapphire.

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:07.908
When the effects wore off
I was a grown man in a boy's body.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.751
All my friends were gone.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:12.962
My father...

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:14.751
gone.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:19.340
Everything and everyone
I cared about was no more.

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:22.597
And all of this is
so you can see your father again?

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:25.884
I want more time!

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:28.261
With him.

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:32.272
He gave me everything.

01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:34.354
And I couldn't even
give him the time of day,

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:36.611
because I didn't know...

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:40.569
...that our time
would be so short together.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:44.118
But now when I go back,
things are gonna be different.

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:46.700
- No, they won't.
- Excuse me?

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.957
travel through time.

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:50.492
Time stays the same.

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:53.411
You're just creating
multiple versions of yourself

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:56.081
that appear at
different points in time.

01:12:56.789 --> 01:13:00.293
He's wrong. Our plan will work.

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:02.757
You've tried this before and failed.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.139
And my guess is that you've...

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:09.261
...already gone back in time a lot.

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:13.811
This isn't the first time
you've traveled back.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:17.853
And every time you return,
you come back worse.

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:23.904
Each time, your plan fails.

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.943
You try it again with another you.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:27.828
But when are you going to learn...

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:29.660
...you can't change the past?

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:31.916
You will only cause Armageddon.

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:36.079
Don't listen to him.
This time, it will work!

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:39.465
You will go back and you will
have all the time in the world

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:41.467
to spend with your father.

01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:43.845
Danger, when my mom died,

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:46.347
it was the worst thing
that could ever happen to me.

01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:48.507
I wished I had more time with her.

01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:50.843
There is no going back.

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:53.896
Honor the years you had with him.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.103
Those brief..

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.109
...Special moments...

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.312
...are the ones we'll remember.

01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:06.701
It's not about how much time you have.

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:10.204
- It's what you choose to do with it.

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:13.537
T minus 20 minutes until Armageddon.

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:16.248
The Time Vortex is opening!

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:25.211
How'd you get outta my sand trap?

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:27.051
With my bare hands.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:29.557
Actually, it was my Atomic Lipstick.

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:33.265
Keep away from my stepkids.

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.722
Make that your kids.

01:14:36.847 --> 01:14:37.848
All right.

01:14:38.224 --> 01:14:40.568
Make that your Spy Kids.

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:45.648
Stay away from my Spy Kids.

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:47.317
Too late!

01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:02.882
It worked! It worked!

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.260
Everyone in the world
is frozen except us.

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.766
The Chronos!

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:18.390
of the watch or you'll freeze!

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:19.978
We have to use the necklace

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:23.611
to stop the Armageddon device
once and for all!

01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:26.652
Get into the Vortex.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:48.173
Wait, you don't
have your Hammer Hands.

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:50.796
I don't need Hammer Hands.

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:03.605
- Yeah!
- Cecil!

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:25.835
Hey, Marissa gave that to me!

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:35.762
- Don't do it, Danger!
- You can't bring back the past!

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.848
Time is the enemy of youth.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:39.683
I'm getting mine back.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.768
You won't change anything!

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:14.763
I thought you said
nothing would change.

01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:16.265
Wait for it.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:28.644
Who's that?

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:29.937
That's Danger.

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:39.826
You were right.

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.667
You can't go back.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:46.663
I tried.

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:49.756
My father still died...

01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:52.960
...no matter what
I tried to do to save him.

01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:58.890
He did tell me one thing

01:17:59.049 --> 01:18:00.972
that was very important.

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:06.228
You have to live life

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:09.519
moving forwards, not back.

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:13.321
This time...

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.152
...I'm gonna listen to him.

01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:40.349
Kids!

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.722
Marissa!

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.980
I was so worried about you guys.
Are you OK?

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:49.108
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry I brought you into this.

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:53.442
Worst stepmom ever.

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:55.485
Yeah.

01:18:55.648 --> 01:19:00.028
But best spy mom ever!
I like when you're being yourself.

01:19:01.779 --> 01:19:05.500
- Come here.

01:19:05.658 --> 01:19:08.252
- You think you've stopped me?

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.504
You've stopped nothing.

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:14.509
We're just gonna keep doing this
over and over and over again

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:17.011
until I get what I want!

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:20.844
Because this time, time is on my side!

01:19:25.302 --> 01:19:27.521
Yeah. Hard time.

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:35.067
- Clocked ya.

01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:37.690
Lucky punch!

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:41.823
How'd you find us?

01:19:41.986 --> 01:19:44.489
I'm Wilbur Wilson, your father.

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:46.453
You're the coolest dad ever.

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:54.290
I'm not gonna wait until I have enough
time for us to spend together.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.049
From now on...

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:58.336
...we're gonna make time.

01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:00.926
Now that's heroic.

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:09.100
So...

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:11.140
So...

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.648
You're a spy?

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:18.565
Yeah. I'm a spy.

01:20:20.024 --> 01:20:21.071
Well...

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:23.744
...I'm a Spy Hunter.

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.413
Got you.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:28.996
And I'm never letting go.

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:40.378
Now this is family time.

01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:45.182
Juni and I have decided
to become co-leaders

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:47.594
of the new Spy Kids program.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.603
We're gonna need some new recruits

01:20:49.762 --> 01:20:53.608
with ingenuity, creativity,
and heads-up thinking.

01:20:53.766 --> 01:20:56.360
Rebecca, Cecil?

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:58.316
And of course...

01:20:58.479 --> 01:20:59.776
...Spy Baby.

01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:04.489
Yeah. Baby's got a surprise for you.

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:08.622
Don't get... This is it, group,
that's it. Just...

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:10.874
Baby's first steps!

01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:14.913
You're more impressed by a kid
standing up than a dog that can talk?

01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:16.626
Hold on a second, I...

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:22.924
Nice!

01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:26.887
Oh! Baby's first bad guy!

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.892
- Wow!
- I taught her that.

01:21:29.426 --> 01:21:30.894
Well...

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:33.476
...you can never start 'em too young.

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:35.687
Mommy's so proud of you!

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:47.369
We are back on the clock,
back to taking our own sweet time

01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:50.748
to laugh, to cry,
to embrace our loved ones.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:53.659
We have all the time in the world.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.746
Or do we?

01:21:58.664 --> 01:22:01.338
Operation Spy Kid Recruitment.

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.805
Setting filters to max.

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:21.820
You have been activated.

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:26.867
And you have been activated.

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:30.450
I now declare you all Spy Kids.

01:22:32.739 --> 01:22:34.491
That's one point for me.

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:36.289
Ouch.
