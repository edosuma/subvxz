Watch some sports
like real men.

01:49.650 --> 01:51.883
This has 10 times the emotion
of your football.

01:53.819 --> 01:55.954
It's ridiculous.

01:55.956 --> 01:59.323
Hey. Sorry, some surfer
gave me wet money.

01:59.325 --> 02:00.758
Well, here
are your deliveries.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.695
Oh, and I would save
650 Cypress for last.

02:03.697 --> 02:06.630
Canadian bacon
and pineapple? No. Ew.

02:06.632 --> 02:08.332
Hey, he's cute,
and you might have fun.

02:08.334 --> 02:10.000
I don't have time for fun.

02:10.002 --> 02:11.335
Well, then
you're doing it wrong.

02:11.337 --> 02:13.071
Add it to the list.

02:13.073 --> 02:14.638
It's not ridiculous.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.141
These stories come
from real life.

02:16.143 --> 02:17.775
Crazy things happen
all the time.

02:17.777 --> 02:20.044
Come on,
back me up on this.

02:20.046 --> 02:21.380
I don't watch
this shit.

02:21.382 --> 02:23.542
I don't even hear it. It's
like working at my <i>abuela's.</i>

02:29.188 --> 02:30.525
Huh.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.827
<i>When suctioning
mucus from a patient's lung,</i>

02:35.829 --> 02:37.696
<i>which action completes
the procedure...</i>

02:38.566 --> 02:40.665
Hey, girls,
come on, let's go!

02:40.667 --> 02:41.833
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, Mom!

02:41.835 --> 02:43.938
Move! We gotta go!

02:47.007 --> 02:48.873
Really, Mom? The sign?

02:48.875 --> 02:50.007
Be embarrassed
in the car, okay?

02:50.009 --> 02:52.376
I've got eight minutes to get
these pizzas across town.

02:52.378 --> 02:53.580
Move!

02:53.947 --> 02:55.880
How was school?

02:55.882 --> 02:57.685
- Fine.
- Oh, don't tip 'em.

03:02.923 --> 03:04.655
Change of plans, sir.

03:04.657 --> 03:06.991
We're just having
some minor mechanical issues.

03:06.993 --> 03:09.828
We'll dock at the nearest
harbor for some repairs

03:09.830 --> 03:11.161
and I'll arrange to have

03:11.163 --> 03:13.064
the carpets
professionally cleaned.

03:13.066 --> 03:15.699
Don't need to know how
the sausage is made, Colin!

03:15.701 --> 03:18.104
Absolutely right, sir.

04:17.163 --> 04:18.798
- Papa. Papa.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:03.209 --> 05:04.610
<i>When swabbing fecal matter,</i>

05:04.612 --> 05:07.312
<i>a nurse should take which
of the following precautions?</i>

05:07.314 --> 05:08.846
- Bye, Mom!
- See ya, Mom!

05:08.848 --> 05:10.815
All right, listen
to your grandma, okay?

05:10.817 --> 05:11.750
Hi, Grandma!

05:11.752 --> 05:13.517
And, hey, I want you
to take a bath, Olivia!

05:13.519 --> 05:15.219
- Use soap.
- Okay.

05:15.221 --> 05:16.288
You're not gonna
believe this.

05:16.290 --> 05:18.856
Remember how I sang
that song from <i>Les Mis</i>

05:18.858 --> 05:20.024
at the Saint James talent show

05:20.026 --> 05:22.026
and everyone said
I was amazing?

05:22.028 --> 05:23.995
Okay, Mom, can you just
type this up in an e-mail,

05:23.997 --> 05:25.262
because I'm gonna be late
for my other job.

05:25.264 --> 05:27.298
Turns out, a producer

05:27.300 --> 05:31.202
from the Eugene Senior Theater
touring company was there.

05:31.204 --> 05:32.771
He had tears.

05:32.773 --> 05:35.305
Anyway, one of their leads
fell in the shower,

05:35.307 --> 05:37.041
and they want me to step in.

05:37.043 --> 05:39.110
What? When is this all
supposed to be happening?

05:39.112 --> 05:41.146
I'm leaving tonight.
They're already in tech.

05:41.148 --> 05:44.115
No! Mom, my nursing exam
is in less than a month

05:44.117 --> 05:45.283
and you agreed to help.

05:45.285 --> 05:49.219
I'm 72. If I don't follow
my dreams now, when will I?

05:49.221 --> 05:52.123
Never, Mom!

05:52.125 --> 05:54.825
The whole reason we moved here
is so I could study more.

05:54.827 --> 05:56.127
I already failed
the exam once.

05:56.129 --> 05:57.127
No, don't guilt me.

05:57.129 --> 05:58.562
You're not the only one
with a dead husband.

05:58.564 --> 06:01.865
Dad's not dead,
you're divorced!

06:01.867 --> 06:04.168
Oh, and I'm gonna need you
to take care of Fiona.

06:04.170 --> 06:06.303
The kennel won't take her.
She has crate anxiety.

06:06.305 --> 06:08.839
You can't possibly
be this selfish.

06:08.841 --> 06:11.308
I'm sorry, honey, but the
theater is calling me.

06:12.879 --> 06:15.413
Oh! Literally.
They need my dress size.

06:15.415 --> 06:19.220
Hi, there. Normally a zero,
but a two if I'm bloated.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.959
Good night.

06:28.961 --> 06:30.230
Hey, don't stay up too late.

06:51.350 --> 06:52.920
Oh, God.

07:04.197 --> 07:06.430
Holy crap.

07:06.432 --> 07:09.336
Here we are. I'll be
around if you need me.

07:20.980 --> 07:22.247
<i>Guess where I am?</i>

07:22.249 --> 07:24.014
Some dude's yacht.

07:24.016 --> 07:25.149
You little tramp.

07:25.151 --> 07:27.418
- I'm cleaning the carpets.
- Oh.

07:27.420 --> 07:30.024
Oh, my God. Theresa,
look at this bathroom.

07:30.990 --> 07:32.959
God, I could live in here!

07:33.225 --> 07:34.324
Oh.

07:34.326 --> 07:38.098
And they have candy.
Who has candy in the bathroom?

07:42.369 --> 07:43.901
That's not candy.

07:43.903 --> 07:45.469
<i>Yeah, because nobody has candy
in the bathroom.</i>

07:45.471 --> 07:47.505
- Oh, God.
- <i>Because it's a bathroom!</i>

07:47.507 --> 07:49.343
<i>Okay, come on, show me more.
Wait, wait, wait.</i>

07:50.374 --> 07:52.110
Is that the guy?
Is he married? He's cute.

07:52.112 --> 07:53.510
And that's not even
a very good picture.

07:53.512 --> 07:54.978
Hello, Theresa!

07:54.980 --> 07:56.447
- Oh, God.
- Hi!

07:56.449 --> 07:58.416
<i>By the way, she's single,
and horny.</i>

07:58.418 --> 08:00.250
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

08:00.252 --> 08:01.685
I'll get out of here.

08:01.687 --> 08:04.255
No, no, no. I should get up.
Busy day.

08:04.257 --> 08:06.093
I've got a lot of...
Whew!

08:07.127 --> 08:09.192
Really nothing to do.

08:09.194 --> 08:11.966
Colin, I'm ready for
my Bloody Mary. Yeah.

08:12.399 --> 08:14.401
Mostly Mary. Yeah.

08:20.273 --> 08:22.406
Well, now you know.

08:22.408 --> 08:25.108
I'm a grown man with
a tattoo on his butt.

08:25.110 --> 08:26.144
Is that Speedy Gonzales?

08:26.146 --> 08:29.279
Do you know another cartoon
mouse with a sombrero?

08:33.186 --> 08:35.152
I hate the pussycat.

08:36.490 --> 08:39.523
Let me guess, you were, uh, a
little tipsy when you got that?

08:39.525 --> 08:41.025
Not at all.

08:41.027 --> 08:43.527
I love Speedy.
He's fast, he's charming.

08:43.529 --> 08:45.363
He's Mexican.

08:45.365 --> 08:47.065
He outsmarts the pussycat

08:47.067 --> 08:49.434
and brings delicious
cheese to his people.

08:49.436 --> 08:51.906
And he's just fun to look at.

08:53.273 --> 08:54.472
My name is Leonardo.

08:54.474 --> 08:57.211
Kate. Sullivan.

08:59.511 --> 09:02.479
You're very attractive
for a carpet cleaning lady.

09:02.481 --> 09:03.580
Yeah.

09:03.582 --> 09:07.251
Although you maybe could do
something with your hair.

09:07.253 --> 09:08.419
Yeah...

09:08.421 --> 09:11.355
No, well, no, that's not it.
It's your face.

09:11.357 --> 09:13.590
Yeah. I mean, it's good.

09:13.592 --> 09:16.493
I wanna like it,
it's just...

09:16.495 --> 09:19.265
It's just somehow less than
the sum of its parts.

09:20.366 --> 09:23.233
What animal do people
say you look like?

09:23.235 --> 09:25.302
Apologies, sir, I thought
you were up and about already.

09:25.304 --> 09:27.305
Ah, finally.
It's about time.

09:27.307 --> 09:32.209
Um, have Chef Gerard prepare
breakfast. Then, fire him.

09:32.211 --> 09:34.545
Of course, but perhaps we could
give him a few weeks' notice.

09:34.547 --> 09:36.079
His wife's expecting.

09:36.081 --> 09:37.484
But his food is boring.

09:38.518 --> 09:39.987
Absolutely.

09:43.089 --> 09:45.623
There you are,
sleepyhead. Hi.

09:45.625 --> 09:49.093
Well, this is awkward.
We're wearing the same thing.

09:54.366 --> 09:56.633
Boop! Boop!

09:56.635 --> 09:58.201
Lead the way, girls!

09:58.203 --> 09:59.436
Okay.

09:59.438 --> 10:01.305
Boop! Boop!

10:03.109 --> 10:05.108
Boop!

10:05.110 --> 10:08.314
Oh, try to hurry. I'm pretty
sure I'm gonna need the room.

10:12.818 --> 10:14.451
- Excuse me, Captain?
- Yeah.

10:14.453 --> 10:16.253
Checked the engine,
you're in luck.

10:16.255 --> 10:18.522
It's just the anti-siphon
valve. No problem.

10:21.494 --> 10:23.294
I was just telling him

10:23.296 --> 10:26.329
that I was right,
and that he's a dumbass.

10:26.331 --> 10:28.266
Say, how'd this dude
make all his money, anyway?

10:28.268 --> 10:29.600
He didn't.

10:29.602 --> 10:32.469
His family owns the largest building
supply company in the world.

10:32.471 --> 10:34.307
Now this is what
he does all day.

10:36.576 --> 10:38.276
Chicken fight?

12:09.535 --> 12:11.234
All right. Here's my info.

12:11.236 --> 12:12.703
If you're ever in Norway,
look me up.

12:12.705 --> 12:14.472
The summers are insane.

12:14.474 --> 12:17.474
That's happening, Oddvar.
That's definitely happening.

12:17.476 --> 12:21.378
Hi. Excuse me, I was
told to clean in there.

12:21.380 --> 12:23.247
Something about
a glitter bomb?

12:23.249 --> 12:24.515
Is that gonna disturb you?

12:24.517 --> 12:25.949
No, not at all.

12:25.951 --> 12:28.953
Hmm. I'm craving something.
What is it?

12:30.255 --> 12:31.622
Excuse me,
are you talking to me?

12:31.624 --> 12:34.492
Sweet, but not
too sweet. Hmm.

12:34.494 --> 12:38.728
Is it mango? I'm pretty
sure it's mango.

12:38.730 --> 12:41.400
No. No, wait, wait.
It's papaya.

12:42.501 --> 12:43.733
Is it papaya?

12:43.735 --> 12:45.670
I would have no way
of knowing that.

12:45.672 --> 12:48.372
Of course.

12:48.374 --> 12:50.343
Could you be a doll
and get me a little of both?

12:51.374 --> 12:52.276
Hmm?

12:52.278 --> 12:54.545
You know I was just hired
to do carpets, right?

12:54.547 --> 12:57.381
I don't see why that should prevent
you from getting me a little snack.

12:57.383 --> 13:00.517
Don't you have, like, 10,000
other people to do that for you?

13:00.519 --> 13:02.320
Yeah. But you're right here.

13:02.322 --> 13:04.421
Okay, I'm sorry, but I really
have to finish up

13:04.423 --> 13:06.357
so I can pick my girls
up from school.

13:06.359 --> 13:08.392
Shh.

13:13.633 --> 13:15.733
Perhaps
you don't know who I am.

13:15.735 --> 13:17.535
I know exactly who you are.

13:17.537 --> 13:20.470
You showed me your ass and did
a number on my self-esteem.

13:20.472 --> 13:22.440
Then why don't
I have my fruit?

13:22.442 --> 13:24.608
Beats me.
But I'm not getting it.

13:24.610 --> 13:26.243
Okay. Fair enough.

13:26.245 --> 13:27.310
You're fired.

13:28.681 --> 13:30.614
For not getting you a mango?

13:30.616 --> 13:31.781
Or a papaya.

13:31.783 --> 13:33.850
Okay, you know what?
That's fine.

13:33.852 --> 13:36.289
Just pay me
and I'll be on my way.

13:37.990 --> 13:42.026
I'm not paying you or the "We
Care Carpet and Fabric Company."

13:42.028 --> 13:44.328
Dude, you have
a toilet in there

13:44.330 --> 13:46.530
that costs more than
I make in a year.

13:46.532 --> 13:49.733
You hired me to do a job.
I did it. You're paying me.

13:49.735 --> 13:50.734
Nope.

13:50.736 --> 13:53.470
Mr. Montenegro, ready
to ship out when you are.

13:53.472 --> 13:56.209
Great! Push off.
The Pacific awaits.

13:56.643 --> 13:58.378
Goodbye, Kate.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.684
You are a horrible person.

14:06.686 --> 14:08.585
<i>A first-class asshole!</i>

14:08.587 --> 14:10.854
"A first-class asshole."

14:10.856 --> 14:12.522
You're no charmer yourself.

14:12.524 --> 14:14.892
Oh, whoa! That stung.

14:16.328 --> 14:18.628
You selfish,
condescending prick!

14:18.630 --> 14:22.767
I bet you haven't worked a single day
in your entire, self-absorbed life.

14:26.471 --> 14:29.540
And to think I was
this, this close,

14:29.542 --> 14:31.511
to inviting you to join
us in the Jacuzzi.

14:33.413 --> 14:36.079
There isn't enough
penicillin in the world!

14:38.384 --> 14:39.916
No, no, wait.
No, no, no.

14:39.918 --> 14:42.585
No. Don't untie the boat.

14:42.587 --> 14:46.656
Excuse me, wait. Excuse me!
Captain! I'm still on board.

14:46.658 --> 14:48.592
Don't leave yet!

14:48.594 --> 14:53.797
Women adore me. I'm charming,
and fit, and disease-free.

14:53.799 --> 14:55.598
Oh, grow up.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.868
You are a vain,
empty little man,

14:57.870 --> 14:59.837
who'd be nothing
without his daddy's money.

15:01.374 --> 15:02.772
Oh, no!

15:02.774 --> 15:05.910
You gotta be kidding me!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait.

15:05.912 --> 15:07.478
Better jump off.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.815
No. No. I am not going
anywhere, until you,

15:10.817 --> 15:14.484
or one of your butlers
or bimbos writes me a check.

15:14.486 --> 15:17.787
Fine. Next stop,
San Francisco.

15:17.789 --> 15:21.294
Fine. I'll be a pain in your
ass for the next 12 hours.

15:24.496 --> 15:25.930
I guess I didn't
think this through.

15:25.932 --> 15:27.701
No, you didn't.

15:30.870 --> 15:33.307
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

15:39.745 --> 15:42.379
What the hell
is wrong with you?

15:42.381 --> 15:43.848
Wait! My equipment.

15:43.850 --> 15:45.319
Oh, of course.

15:46.652 --> 15:47.517
Here you are.

15:47.519 --> 15:50.590
No! No, no, no!
It's very expensive! No!

15:50.856 --> 15:52.623
Oh!

15:52.625 --> 15:55.759
Wait. I forgot something.
Your bucket.

15:55.761 --> 15:57.463
- Fetch.
- No!

16:04.736 --> 16:06.503
And just so you know,

16:06.505 --> 16:09.473
my life is not empty!
Hmm?

16:09.475 --> 16:13.477
Everyone wants my life
because it's meaningful.

16:13.479 --> 16:14.815
I hate you!

16:15.648 --> 16:17.484
Goodbye.

16:25.490 --> 16:26.625
Oh, God.

16:29.961 --> 16:33.597
And now I owe the cleaning company
$3,000 for a new machine!

16:33.599 --> 16:35.833
And they fired me.
He is the devil.

16:35.835 --> 16:37.568
Whoa, who's the devil?

16:37.570 --> 16:39.903
- Leonardo Montenegro.
- Who's that?

16:39.905 --> 16:42.906
Says here he's the son of the
third richest man in the world.

16:42.908 --> 16:46.509
A Latino? Hell yeah.
<i>Mi gente,</i> babe, showin' up.

16:46.511 --> 16:48.912
Hey! Those are for the crew,
right? Not their boss?

16:48.914 --> 16:50.815
What are you talking about,
babe? I lost eight pounds.

16:50.817 --> 16:52.977
Pretty soon I'm gonna be
breaking out my skinny shirts.

16:57.789 --> 16:59.456
I love when he dances.

16:59.458 --> 17:00.791
Bring back the Hasselbeck.

17:00.793 --> 17:02.493
You know what I got
in my bank account?

17:02.495 --> 17:06.497
$42. I need to get
another job. Like, tonight.

17:06.499 --> 17:07.698
Bobby, are you hiring?

17:07.700 --> 17:10.601
Yeah, sure, if you can haul
giant bags of concrete all day.

17:10.603 --> 17:13.536
We could probably scrape
together a few bucks for you.

17:13.538 --> 17:16.873
Just Benny started college
and somebody bought a boat!

17:16.875 --> 17:18.642
Come on, babe,
we're gonna relitigate this?

17:18.644 --> 17:20.678
I paid significantly
below market for that boat.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.078
I had to buy it.
It was a steal.

17:22.079 --> 17:23.948
Why am I even trying
to be a nurse?

17:23.950 --> 17:25.782
I'm gonna be
delivering pizzas

17:25.785 --> 17:27.651
and cleaning carpets
for the rest of my life.

17:27.653 --> 17:29.556
Kate, don't say that.
Hey, look.

17:30.522 --> 17:31.721
Have a garlic knot.

17:31.723 --> 17:34.624
It makes everything just a
little bit better, I promise.

17:34.626 --> 17:35.825
No, it doesn't.

17:35.827 --> 17:37.431
No? I'll have one.

17:49.275 --> 17:51.842
<i>Moretti
plays it back to midfield,</i>

17:51.844 --> 17:53.576
<i>controlling the
pace as always.</i>

18:09.795 --> 18:11.094
Oops.

18:11.096 --> 18:13.096
Give me a second.
Don't turn of.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.567
My condom drawer's empty.

18:17.569 --> 18:18.936
I'll fix this.

18:18.938 --> 18:22.072
<i>And the door was wide open,
but Magnusson hesitates...</i>

18:24.076 --> 18:25.709
I've told
the man repeatedly,

18:25.711 --> 18:27.777
for the nine minutes
I am having my supper,

18:27.779 --> 18:28.949
I am off the clock.

18:31.717 --> 18:33.653
What am I paying
these people for?

18:34.953 --> 18:36.053
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

19:04.349 --> 19:05.684
Please be here.

19:07.053 --> 19:09.789
Damn it,
I'm relentless.

19:14.926 --> 19:15.928
Hmm.

19:34.747 --> 19:35.815
Yes!

19:36.749 --> 19:37.851
Five!

19:52.198 --> 19:53.567
Whoa!

19:58.971 --> 20:00.203
Help me, somebody!

20:00.205 --> 20:02.672
Help me, please!

20:02.674 --> 20:04.711
Please, anyone, help!

20:05.076 --> 20:07.210
Colin! Help!

20:07.212 --> 20:09.148
- <i>Goal!</i>
- Yeah! Yeah!

20:12.218 --> 20:13.586
Help me!

20:15.855 --> 20:17.921
Help, Captain!

20:24.997 --> 20:27.701
Help! Help, somebody!

21:20.185 --> 21:21.654
Rough night, pal?

21:30.296 --> 21:31.495
Hey!

21:37.970 --> 21:39.737
I don't wanna get
your hopes up, ma'am,

21:39.739 --> 21:41.971
but we might
have found him.

21:41.973 --> 21:43.907
Like I told the officer,

21:43.909 --> 21:47.076
I don't know what day it is.
I don't know where I was born.

21:47.078 --> 21:49.846
I don't even know my own name.

21:49.848 --> 21:51.981
I remember nothing
except waking up

21:51.983 --> 21:53.950
on a beach with
an ass full of sand.

21:53.952 --> 21:55.151
You're a doctor, right?

21:55.153 --> 21:56.789
Well, fix it.

21:57.189 --> 21:58.725
And also...

22:00.925 --> 22:02.828
Can I get a prettier nurse?

22:04.096 --> 22:05.699
She is the pretty one.

22:12.070 --> 22:15.905
<i>Probably caused by acute
trauma to the medial temporal lobe.</i>

22:15.907 --> 22:19.176
Amnesia, really?
Is it permanent?

22:19.178 --> 22:21.545
Well, the brain
is a tricky thing.

22:21.547 --> 22:23.780
He might get his memory back
in a couple of days

22:23.782 --> 22:25.783
or maybe never at all.

22:25.785 --> 22:27.785
But to be honest,
we've only had

22:27.787 --> 22:29.920
one case of amnesia
here in Elk Cove

22:29.922 --> 22:33.323
and that was a pretty young
woman back in the '80s.

22:33.325 --> 22:36.325
Fingers crossed,
this is your brother,

22:36.327 --> 22:39.095
but this is a beach town, we do
get our share of homeless here.

22:39.097 --> 22:41.864
So what happens if he's just some
poor guy living on the street?

22:41.866 --> 22:45.169
Then he'll be shipped off to a
psychiatric facility up in Salem.

22:45.171 --> 22:46.905
- Oh, my God.
- People get lost up there.

22:47.972 --> 22:49.206
Here we are.

22:49.208 --> 22:52.276
And he really
remembers nothing?

22:52.278 --> 22:53.678
Not a thing.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.983
For the hundredth time,
I don't want chicken or beef.

22:58.017 --> 22:59.382
I want fish.

22:59.384 --> 23:03.222
A simple, grilled piece of sea bass.
With a buttery Chardonnay.

23:05.290 --> 23:06.890
That's not my brother.

23:06.892 --> 23:09.026
Do it! Today!

23:09.028 --> 23:10.594
What are you waiting for?

23:18.170 --> 23:19.906
Oh, shit.

23:20.239 --> 23:22.174
Shit! Ow.

23:23.308 --> 23:24.309
Shit!

23:25.211 --> 23:26.276
Shit.

23:26.278 --> 23:30.113
I got two weeks. I am having
a total anxiety attack.

23:30.115 --> 23:32.048
I can't make
those girls move again.

23:32.050 --> 23:34.383
Okay, honey, hang on. I got
a half a Xanax in my purse.

23:34.385 --> 23:36.053
We're gonna
figure this out.

23:36.055 --> 23:37.755
Kate. Look at this.

23:37.757 --> 23:42.124
I was searching for a used lawnmower in
the <i>Beachcomber,</i> and look what I found.

23:42.126 --> 23:45.895
Amnesia. Right here
in our little town.

23:45.897 --> 23:47.864
I told you this stuff happens
all the time.

23:47.866 --> 23:49.432
Dude has no idea who he is.

23:49.434 --> 23:50.869
Oh, my God.

23:51.936 --> 23:53.972
Oh, my God.
That's him.

23:54.940 --> 23:57.341
That's the asshole!

23:57.343 --> 23:59.910
"An unidentified homeless man.

23:59.912 --> 24:02.645
"General retrograde amnesia.

24:02.647 --> 24:04.381
"There was hope
a Mexico City woman

24:04.383 --> 24:07.217
"yachting nearby
might be his sister, but..."

24:07.219 --> 24:09.452
That was his sister.

24:09.454 --> 24:10.653
Unbelievable.

24:10.655 --> 24:12.189
I bet she's pretending
not to know him,

24:12.191 --> 24:13.422
so she can take over
the company.

24:13.424 --> 24:15.861
They did that on
<i>Amor sin Maquillaje.</i>

24:16.095 --> 24:17.094
Okay.

24:17.096 --> 24:19.095
We are going down
to the hospital right now

24:19.097 --> 24:20.363
and getting the money
he owes me.

24:20.365 --> 24:22.399
And add a little
for pain and suffering, too.

24:22.401 --> 24:25.902
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna add a lot.
He treated me like crap.

24:25.904 --> 24:27.203
Yeah, and I
need new cleats.

24:27.205 --> 24:28.905
We're all gonna
get new cleats!

24:28.907 --> 24:29.974
Okay, wait.
Hey, Kate?

24:29.976 --> 24:32.109
If he didn't pay you when
he knew who you were,

24:32.111 --> 24:34.080
what makes you think
he's gonna pay you now?

24:36.347 --> 24:38.981
This is so frustrating!

24:38.983 --> 24:41.285
I hate rich people.
They get away with everything.

24:41.287 --> 24:43.152
But you know what?
No, not this time.

24:43.154 --> 24:46.055
Because I am not gonna
tell them who he is.

24:46.057 --> 24:48.060
I am just gonna let him
rot in there.

24:48.928 --> 24:51.260
Yeah, you could do that,

24:51.262 --> 24:54.931
or you can be like them and take
advantage of the situation.

24:54.933 --> 24:56.699
How? How could I do that?

25:00.405 --> 25:01.875
What?

25:11.016 --> 25:12.349
State or federal?

25:12.351 --> 25:14.517
All right, hey, girls. I'm
gonna need you to help your mom

25:14.519 --> 25:15.986
dig up some old family photos.

25:15.988 --> 25:19.088
I'm gonna ask Bobby to loan us a box
of his useless, skinny clothes,

25:19.090 --> 25:21.458
because I have an idea
that you're gonna hate,

25:21.460 --> 25:24.931
but you're wrong because
it is poetic in its justice.

25:27.231 --> 25:28.731
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:28.733 --> 25:32.035
I'm here to pick up my
husband, the man with amnesia.

25:32.037 --> 25:33.970
Oh. You must be Kate?

25:33.972 --> 25:36.440
Dr. Fletcher was so excited
to get your call.

25:36.442 --> 25:37.442
We all were.

25:38.277 --> 25:39.345
I'll go get him.

25:41.046 --> 25:44.046
Almost forgot. Here's
everything he had with him.

25:44.048 --> 25:45.050
Thank you.

25:55.027 --> 25:57.059
Wait, okay,
you're just nervous.

25:57.061 --> 25:58.194
Yeah, really nervous.

25:58.196 --> 26:00.430
This is crazy
and probably illegal.

26:00.432 --> 26:04.433
Kate, come on.
Where are you going?

26:04.435 --> 26:06.469
Look, do you wanna get evicted?

26:06.471 --> 26:07.705
Of course not.

26:07.707 --> 26:10.474
Okay, well, then stick to the script.
We have a plan.

26:10.476 --> 26:13.276
One month until the test.
Bobby will hire him,

26:13.278 --> 26:16.013
and he'll be an extra paycheck,
so you have time to study.

26:16.015 --> 26:19.216
I barely know the guy.
I am not gonna let him move in.

26:19.218 --> 26:21.250
But you're gonna
be there, studying.

26:21.252 --> 26:22.219
That's why it's genius.

26:22.221 --> 26:24.086
He'll never have to be
alone with the kids.

26:24.088 --> 26:25.154
Come on.

26:25.156 --> 26:27.059
You're doing this
for your girls.

26:28.326 --> 26:30.227
I'm doing this for my girls.

26:30.229 --> 26:31.194
There you go.

26:31.196 --> 26:34.132
Okay, here, use this.
Bobby won't even notice.

26:35.634 --> 26:37.299
Good news.

26:37.301 --> 26:40.202
Your wife has come
to take you home.

26:40.204 --> 26:43.241
Finally.
It's about time.

26:44.576 --> 26:46.479
What? Wait.

26:47.479 --> 26:48.480
I'm married?

26:51.549 --> 26:52.985
Hi, honey.

26:56.821 --> 26:59.291
I do not recognize this lady.

27:01.093 --> 27:02.592
I was afraid
this would happen.

27:02.594 --> 27:05.398
Did you bring the materials
we talked about?

27:06.565 --> 27:10.366
I know this must be
very disorienting,

27:10.368 --> 27:12.538
but here's our
marriage license.

27:14.440 --> 27:17.407
My name is Leo Sullivan?

27:17.409 --> 27:20.242
Yes. Your great-grandfather...

27:20.244 --> 27:24.413
Your great-great-grandfather,
Finbar Sullivan,

27:24.415 --> 27:31.121
emigrated from Ireland, to fight
for Mexico in the war of 1846.

27:33.357 --> 27:36.461
That's gobbledygook!
It can't be true.

27:38.163 --> 27:42.565
Honey, we have been
married for 15 years.

27:42.567 --> 27:45.102
We have three
wonderful daughters.

27:45.104 --> 27:48.337
No, there's no way
I have children.

27:48.339 --> 27:50.140
And if I did,
they'd be sons.

27:50.142 --> 27:51.540
I'm just saying.

27:51.542 --> 27:56.181
I have your passport,
your birth certificate...

27:56.515 --> 27:58.347
Oh...

27:58.349 --> 28:00.717
Here's a photo
from our honeymoon.

28:00.719 --> 28:02.321
We went to Reno?

28:03.454 --> 28:05.188
Now I know you're lying.

28:05.190 --> 28:07.490
Leo! Sweetie,
stop puzzling.

28:07.492 --> 28:08.359
I'm puzzling.

28:08.361 --> 28:12.429
You and I are
Mr. and Mrs. Leo Sullivan.

28:12.431 --> 28:14.067
We met in Cancun.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.333
You were a tour guide.

28:16.335 --> 28:18.668
I was working
on a cruise ship.

28:18.670 --> 28:20.737
Is any of this
ringing a bell?

28:20.739 --> 28:22.706
Nope. Nothing.

28:22.708 --> 28:25.307
We dated
every time I docked.

28:25.309 --> 28:27.344
We would get
frozen yogurt

28:27.346 --> 28:30.247
and watch the sunset
over the Playa Tortugas.

28:30.249 --> 28:32.181
That's where
we fell in love.

28:32.183 --> 28:34.284
Sounds like you're
a romantic, Leo.

28:34.286 --> 28:35.619
Look, look, look.

28:35.621 --> 28:38.488
I admit there are many things
I've forgotten,

28:38.490 --> 28:40.590
but from the depths
of my soul,

28:40.592 --> 28:42.491
I know I'm not married
to this woman.

28:42.493 --> 28:46.263
So, unless I see
some real proof,

28:46.265 --> 28:48.701
I'm getting a slice
of pie at the cafeteria, hmm?

28:50.269 --> 28:52.270
Good luck, crazy lady.

28:53.204 --> 28:55.705
Wait, wait. Wait. Honey?

28:55.707 --> 28:58.542
I didn't wanna say this,

28:58.544 --> 29:00.544
because I know
it embarrasses you.

29:00.546 --> 29:05.384
But you have a tattoo of a cartoon
mouse on your right butt cheek.

29:05.951 --> 29:07.185
No, I don't.

29:19.198 --> 29:20.596
You're really my wife?

29:20.598 --> 29:22.701
For better or worse, baby.

29:50.429 --> 29:53.563
All right, here we are.

29:53.565 --> 29:57.603
I know it doesn't look like
much, but it's full of love.

30:07.445 --> 30:08.580
I'm poor?

30:08.814 --> 30:10.182
Yup.

30:15.586 --> 30:17.190
Come on in.

30:20.025 --> 30:21.757
Oh, Dad!

30:21.759 --> 30:24.526
- Daddy!
- We missed you so much.

30:25.730 --> 30:27.599
I'm so glad you're okay.

30:30.769 --> 30:31.867
Emily?

30:31.869 --> 30:33.269
Hey.

30:33.271 --> 30:35.337
She's too cool to admit it,

30:35.339 --> 30:38.475
but she was
the most worried of all.

30:38.477 --> 30:42.248
I'm sorry, I
don't recognize any of you.

30:42.748 --> 30:44.546
Oh, come on.

30:44.548 --> 30:48.485
Molly, Olivia, Emily,

30:48.487 --> 30:50.423
your three musketeers?

30:51.455 --> 30:52.488
No.

30:52.490 --> 30:55.294
Uh... I've got homework.

31:01.432 --> 31:02.766
How come they don't
look like me?

31:02.768 --> 31:04.500
Oh, sweetie...

31:04.502 --> 31:06.402
We had trouble
getting pregnant,

31:06.404 --> 31:08.374
so we had to use
a sperm donor.

31:09.674 --> 31:10.840
I'm sterile?

31:10.842 --> 31:12.842
That doesn't change a thing.

31:12.844 --> 31:14.678
You are still their father.

31:14.680 --> 31:17.780
You've done everything
for this family.

31:17.782 --> 31:21.386
Taken two, even three jobs.

31:21.686 --> 31:22.620
I work?

31:22.622 --> 31:24.787
How do you think
we can pay for all of this?

31:24.789 --> 31:28.658
I'm afraid to ask, but
what do I do for a living?

31:28.660 --> 31:30.660
Well, before
you got laid off,

31:30.662 --> 31:32.696
you were a foreman at
the poultry processing plant.

31:32.698 --> 31:34.363
Luckily, Bobby,

31:34.365 --> 31:36.665
my boss's husband,
you met bowling,

31:36.667 --> 31:39.335
gave you a job
at his construction company.

31:39.337 --> 31:42.671
It is awful, backbreaking
work, I know,

31:42.673 --> 31:44.507
but we are lucky
to have it.

31:46.377 --> 31:49.414
I need a drink.
Lots of them.

31:52.784 --> 31:55.552
What? Please don't tell me I'm sober?

31:55.554 --> 31:57.487
You had your three-year chip,

31:57.489 --> 31:58.755
but then you relapsed

31:58.757 --> 32:01.857
and you ended up on that beach.

32:01.859 --> 32:06.528
So what is that? Four days?
You got four days, honey.

32:06.530 --> 32:08.667
- We're still really proud of you.
- Mm-hmm.

32:09.367 --> 32:10.734
I see.

32:10.736 --> 32:13.439
No alcohol. Whatsoever.

32:13.771 --> 32:15.671
<i>Nada.</i>

32:15.673 --> 32:17.841
I need to use the restroom.

32:17.843 --> 32:20.876
I assume it's that room
over there with the toilet.

32:20.878 --> 32:24.146
Look at you, babe.
It's all coming back!

32:26.451 --> 32:27.519
Boop.

32:28.686 --> 32:29.986
I don't like that.

32:31.589 --> 32:33.390
One more.

32:33.392 --> 32:34.894
Boop, boop!

32:49.807 --> 32:51.711
This can't be my life.

33:13.999 --> 33:15.367
Honey!

33:18.036 --> 33:19.904
- Hey!
- Hi.

33:21.038 --> 33:23.475
Running low on toilet paper.

33:24.576 --> 33:25.874
Under the sink!

33:25.876 --> 33:26.979
Of course.

33:29.748 --> 33:31.514
Yes.

33:31.516 --> 33:33.786
Under the sink,
of course.

33:41.492 --> 33:43.793
Please keep my beloved brother
in your prayers

33:43.795 --> 33:45.027
as you head back to Mexico.

33:45.029 --> 33:47.796
I'm going to stay here
until I find him.

33:47.798 --> 33:49.801
Alive or...

33:54.806 --> 33:57.910
Good thoughts, people.
Only good thoughts.

34:04.915 --> 34:06.850
I was fat?

34:06.852 --> 34:11.954
Um, yeah. You didn't make the best
decisions when you were drinking, honey.

34:11.956 --> 34:13.655
Tomorrow
we're going to Goodwill.

34:13.657 --> 34:15.056
Bobby's skinny clothes
are not skinny.

34:15.059 --> 34:17.793
I assume these Seahawks
are some kind of sports team

34:17.795 --> 34:19.527
and I'm a big fan,

34:19.530 --> 34:20.795
because most of my clothes

34:20.797 --> 34:23.099
have this God-awful
green and blue bird on it.

34:23.101 --> 34:25.900
Football, Dad.
It's our thing.

34:25.902 --> 34:27.969
We watch every game together.

34:27.972 --> 34:29.838
Even when I haven't
done my homework.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.407
Hey. Everyone does
their homework.

34:31.409 --> 34:35.677
Including me. And right now I've gotta
memorize protocols for thoracic surgery.

34:35.679 --> 34:38.581
So, Leo, why don't you get
dinner started?

34:38.583 --> 34:41.918
What? Cook? Me? Cook?

34:41.920 --> 34:44.920
Sweetheart, I know
you had a head injury,

34:44.922 --> 34:46.958
but we made a deal.

34:47.893 --> 34:49.992
While I'm studying for my exam,

34:49.994 --> 34:52.728
you keep the house running.

34:52.731 --> 34:55.532
But I don't even know
how to turn on the stove.

34:55.534 --> 34:58.867
Oh! Honey, come on.

34:58.869 --> 35:01.873
Salad, pasta. There's a jar
of sauce in the fridge.

35:06.878 --> 35:08.077
Holy cow.

35:08.079 --> 35:10.615
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
uh, pardon me.

35:15.320 --> 35:18.524
Nothing like an icy cold beer
on a warm day.

35:19.757 --> 35:21.059
Mmm, mmm.

35:22.994 --> 35:25.498
Yes.

35:50.989 --> 35:52.621
Ugh!

35:52.623 --> 35:54.190
Is this the sauce
we always use?

35:54.192 --> 35:57.126
It tastes like red nothing.

35:57.128 --> 35:59.963
And how are you supposed to tell
when the noodles are done?

35:59.965 --> 36:00.966
Taste one.

36:11.041 --> 36:12.944
Mmm. Mmm.

36:14.980 --> 36:16.815
Hot, hot, hot!

36:24.688 --> 36:26.222
When's the maid coming?

36:26.224 --> 36:29.028
As I'm saying this,
I fear I'm the maid.

36:30.728 --> 36:32.830
No one cleans
like you do, sweetie.

36:38.103 --> 36:40.003
This is awesome.

36:40.005 --> 36:41.403
Honey?

36:41.405 --> 36:44.809
Try not to dilly dally.
We're all super hungry.

36:47.012 --> 36:49.112
I like having a dad around.

36:49.114 --> 36:51.414
He's not your dad, genius.

36:51.416 --> 36:53.749
You agreed to have
a good attitude.

36:53.751 --> 36:56.119
And I'll have a great attitude
if you let him babysit,

36:56.121 --> 36:58.987
so I'm not stuck here watching
these guys all the time.

36:58.989 --> 37:01.657
We went over this.
I don't want him to babysit.

37:01.659 --> 37:03.992
Why does he only get
to do your chores?

37:03.994 --> 37:06.963
I wanna go to the pool like
every other kid in my class.

37:06.965 --> 37:09.065
I don't care!
He's not babysitting.

37:09.067 --> 37:10.307
'Cause you think
he's a pervert?

37:11.835 --> 37:12.901
Of course not!

37:12.903 --> 37:14.237
What's a pervert?

37:14.239 --> 37:16.673
- Nothing.
- Then can I have one?

37:16.675 --> 37:20.144
No! He's not babysitting.
End of story.

37:21.012 --> 37:22.211
Good night.

37:22.213 --> 37:24.650
I never get anything.

37:28.152 --> 37:31.723
So, is this where
the magic happens?

37:34.159 --> 37:36.025
You don't even remember
who I am,

37:36.027 --> 37:37.896
and you still wanna
have sex with me?

37:38.963 --> 37:40.899
Yes. Very much.

37:42.132 --> 37:43.932
So, basically,

37:43.934 --> 37:46.735
you wanna have sex
with a complete stranger?

37:46.737 --> 37:48.871
Yes. Very much.

37:48.873 --> 37:50.807
All right, big boy.

37:50.809 --> 37:51.944
You know the rules.

37:53.978 --> 37:56.248
What? Hey, wait, wait, wait.

37:57.315 --> 37:58.851
I'm not sleeping with you?

38:00.050 --> 38:02.150
You need 30 days
clean and sober.

38:02.152 --> 38:05.790
You and your sponsor came up with that.
It was your idea, not mine.

38:06.925 --> 38:08.958
What are you saying?

38:08.960 --> 38:11.728
- Boop!
- You're gonna make me sleep on the couch?

38:11.730 --> 38:13.195
Nope. We tried that last time

38:13.197 --> 38:15.298
and you ended up
in the liquor cabinet.

38:17.501 --> 38:20.005
So, where am I sleeping?

38:22.172 --> 38:23.675
Here you go.

38:24.275 --> 38:26.211
You have a cot and everything.

38:28.045 --> 38:29.211
All right,

38:29.213 --> 38:32.248
so I'm gonna lock up
the house for the night.

38:32.250 --> 38:34.820
If you need to use the bathroom,

38:36.121 --> 38:37.222
here you go.

38:39.190 --> 38:40.858
I'm a nobody.

38:42.025 --> 38:45.894
A poor, sterile, drunk nobody,

38:45.896 --> 38:47.764
who has to pee in a bottle.

38:47.766 --> 38:49.932
But you're my nobody.

38:49.934 --> 38:53.536
All right, Bobby's picking you up
in the morning, bright and early.

38:53.538 --> 38:56.238
So you need to get
some rest, okay?

38:56.240 --> 38:58.844
Oh, and watch out for bears.

39:54.097 --> 39:56.335
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

39:59.436 --> 40:01.170
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you.

40:01.172 --> 40:03.139
Yeah, don't spill on it.

40:03.141 --> 40:05.043
It's a classic and everything.

40:06.844 --> 40:08.246
Seriously, they're hard to find.

40:14.184 --> 40:15.851
<i>Okay, everybody.</i>

40:15.853 --> 40:17.052
This is Leo.

40:17.054 --> 40:19.054
Burro. Burrito.

40:19.056 --> 40:21.090
Vito, because he loves
<i>The Godfather.</i>

40:21.092 --> 40:22.458
This is my worthless nephew,
Jason.

40:22.460 --> 40:25.228
We call him Lucky, because
he's lucky to have a job.

40:25.230 --> 40:28.164
And 'cause I got hit by
lightning. Twice. For real.

40:28.166 --> 40:29.365
I shouldn't even be here.

40:29.367 --> 40:31.367
Yeah. Gordo was like,
"Whoa, shit!"

40:31.369 --> 40:34.070
Bro, you don't get
to call me that, okay?

40:34.072 --> 40:36.371
And don't be so cocky.
I used to look just like you.

40:36.373 --> 40:38.974
The hair, the abs,
the little bedroom eyes.

40:38.976 --> 40:41.043
You definitely don't
get to call me that.

40:41.045 --> 40:43.765
You gotta work for me at
least six months, okay?

41:00.130 --> 41:01.930
Come on, we got
a pool to dig. Let's go.

41:03.367 --> 41:04.369
Hey.

41:06.204 --> 41:10.273
Listen, I'm pretty sure
I've never worked construction.

41:10.275 --> 41:14.010
So, I might be more suited
for running errands,

41:14.012 --> 41:16.012
or maybe
some light office work.

41:16.014 --> 41:17.979
I could be the guy
who gets the muffins.

41:17.981 --> 41:19.382
Look, I got your back,
all right?

41:19.384 --> 41:21.684
- I'll go easy on you.
- Good.

41:21.686 --> 41:23.088
Great.

41:31.161 --> 41:32.360
Yo!

41:32.362 --> 41:34.365
Any of this jogging your memory,
Lady Hands?

41:38.135 --> 41:40.369
After this I got
a real easy job for you.

41:40.371 --> 41:42.137
No, I'm just kidding, bro.

42:00.090 --> 42:01.326
Uh...

42:14.237 --> 42:16.040
No, no, no.

42:54.579 --> 42:57.045
- Coffee.
- Yes.

42:57.047 --> 42:58.280
Thank you.

42:58.282 --> 42:59.284
You're welcome.

43:00.083 --> 43:01.217
Look at this guy.

43:01.219 --> 43:04.153
He's got it all dialed in,
with his espresso machine

43:04.155 --> 43:05.524
and that sweet little peach.

43:06.523 --> 43:09.090
That's gonna be me one day.

43:09.092 --> 43:11.028
You can come over
whenever you want, bro.

43:13.231 --> 43:15.630
Hey, guys?

43:15.632 --> 43:19.367
Can I get you to haul the dirt
on the other side of the house?

43:19.369 --> 43:20.802
I know it's longer,

43:20.804 --> 43:23.724
but Nadia and I are trying
to have a quiet morning.

43:24.574 --> 43:26.608
- Right.
- No speak English.

43:26.610 --> 43:29.378
Sorry.
I will talk to Bobby.

43:29.380 --> 43:30.382
<i>Si.</i> Bobby.

43:33.583 --> 43:35.119
I love doing that.

44:36.146 --> 44:39.648
Remember, when you're
washing the jersey, cold water.

44:39.650 --> 44:42.554
You listen.
Gentle cycle. Okay?

44:44.322 --> 44:46.354
<i>Bueno.</i>

44:46.356 --> 44:49.258
Hey, respecting
the wash instructions

44:49.260 --> 44:52.193
is the best way
to respect the team.

44:52.195 --> 44:54.065
And no reds, they tend to bleed!

44:59.704 --> 45:03.341
Tortured, tired, thirsty.

45:05.742 --> 45:09.177
Hi, honey!
How was your first day?

45:09.179 --> 45:10.648
Terrible. My body.

45:11.615 --> 45:15.483
Pain. Every. Part.

45:15.485 --> 45:17.186
Oh.

45:17.188 --> 45:18.686
I was in the car...

45:22.659 --> 45:25.293
And I said, "What?"

45:25.295 --> 45:26.595
Do we need to take him
to the hospital?

45:26.597 --> 45:28.363
- I said, "Bobby..."
- No, no, no. No.

45:28.365 --> 45:30.733
He is fine.
He just needs some rest.

45:30.735 --> 45:32.700
Rest. Rest.

45:32.702 --> 45:34.403
Oh, that's right.

45:34.405 --> 45:36.505
Dirt is...

45:36.507 --> 45:38.606
You know what? Why don't you
take a few minutes,

45:38.608 --> 45:41.445
before you get started on all the
things you have to do tonight?

45:42.579 --> 45:45.514
What? There's more?

45:45.516 --> 45:48.416
I know you're
having trouble remembering,

45:48.418 --> 45:50.351
so I made you a list.

45:50.353 --> 45:51.487
No, no, no.

45:51.489 --> 45:55.257
It's physically impossible
for me to get off this couch.

45:55.259 --> 45:57.525
I mean, my legs are
no longer functioning.

45:57.527 --> 45:59.461
Look. Look.

45:59.463 --> 46:01.666
I want, but I can't.

46:03.400 --> 46:05.568
And even if I could move...

46:05.570 --> 46:09.374
I wouldn't want to do any of
the vile things on this list.

46:11.442 --> 46:13.344
There's a couple more
on the back, too.

46:34.231 --> 46:36.565
I know that guy.
How do I know that guy?

46:36.567 --> 46:38.737
Hey. Do you work
at Jiffy Lube?

46:40.704 --> 46:42.373
God, I hope not.

46:44.307 --> 46:46.277
This is gonna drive me crazy.

47:10.367 --> 47:12.635
Is this new sauce?
It tastes different.

47:12.637 --> 47:15.604
Yeah.
I added a few things.

47:15.606 --> 47:18.706
Some chopped onion,
a little red pepper

47:18.708 --> 47:21.342
and a pinch of something
called cumin.

47:21.344 --> 47:25.313
I couldn't bear another bowl
of that tasteless slop.

47:25.315 --> 47:27.218
I like it.
I like it a lot.

47:27.617 --> 47:28.719
It's better, right?

47:29.387 --> 47:30.320
I don't know.

47:30.322 --> 47:32.621
I feel like we've been
having pasta too much.

47:32.623 --> 47:34.722
Maybe you should
mix it up a little.

47:34.724 --> 47:38.459
Okay, I'm gonna take
mine up to study.

47:38.461 --> 47:41.766
Hey, after you clean the kitchen,
don't forget, it's garbage day.

47:48.438 --> 47:51.643
It's entirely clear to me now why
I blocked out my life, Fiona.

47:53.311 --> 47:54.813
It's a hideous existence.

47:58.815 --> 48:00.715
Good night, you guys.
I love you.

48:00.717 --> 48:02.477
- Good night, Mom.
- Love you.

48:06.923 --> 48:10.325
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Aren't you exhausted?

48:10.327 --> 48:12.764
Who would use exhaustion
as an excuse to not make love?

48:14.498 --> 48:15.697
Everybody.

48:16.735 --> 48:21.570
To the shed. I know. I know.
It's hard for me, too.

48:21.572 --> 48:22.774
Nice work today.

48:42.460 --> 48:43.827
Turn it off! Turn it off!

48:46.530 --> 48:48.365
Turn it off!

48:52.135 --> 48:54.436
Yo, I'm
gonna post this on my Snapchat.

48:54.438 --> 48:56.405
I'm gonna make you
a little beaver, bro.

48:56.407 --> 48:58.139
How come we always
get the shit jobs?

48:58.141 --> 49:00.141
Because you're unskilled laborers!

49:00.143 --> 49:02.443
Land of the free,
no land of the free lunch.

49:08.552 --> 49:11.519
Okay. You are a genius.

49:11.521 --> 49:13.454
I got seven hours
of sleep last night,

49:13.456 --> 49:15.858
and guess what
he's making for dinner?

49:15.860 --> 49:18.459
Chicken skewers, coconut rice.

49:18.461 --> 49:20.862
Aw, I want a fake husband.

49:20.864 --> 49:22.764
Thank you. Thank you.

49:22.766 --> 49:25.566
I got more studying done this
week than I have in months.

49:25.568 --> 49:26.901
Maybe next time I ask you
to commit a crime,

49:26.903 --> 49:28.440
you won't fight me on it.

50:59.262 --> 51:00.963
Bro,
you're lucky you have amnesia.

51:00.965 --> 51:02.498
I remember when I thought
my nephew

51:02.500 --> 51:03.898
was actually gonna
do something with his life.

51:03.900 --> 51:06.140
Music is something. I'm an artist.

51:06.737 --> 51:07.936
You're sleeping
on my couch, bro.

51:07.938 --> 51:08.836
Yeah, well,
that tune's gonna change

51:08.838 --> 51:10.838
when I thank you
at the Grammys, Gordo.

51:10.840 --> 51:11.940
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

51:11.942 --> 51:14.543
You better pick it up, dawg.
You know what I'm saying?

51:14.545 --> 51:17.079
'Cause the Diaz metabolism
slows down around 30.

51:17.081 --> 51:18.280
See this right here?

51:18.282 --> 51:21.983
It's not gonna get you on the charts, dawg.

51:21.985 --> 51:23.151
I got some work
I don't feel like doing.

51:23.153 --> 51:25.553
Why do you even wear that hard hat, man?

52:14.003 --> 52:16.003
"Act like a man."

52:22.012 --> 52:23.132
Act like a man.

52:29.820 --> 52:31.856
Act like a man!

52:38.996 --> 52:41.128
- See you tomorrow, Bobby.
- Okay, brother.

52:41.130 --> 52:43.934
Hey, remember, don't tell
Theresa about the chicken parm.

53:02.186 --> 53:03.555
Hey.

53:04.054 --> 53:05.720
Hey.

53:05.722 --> 53:07.025
I got you something.

53:07.824 --> 53:08.960
Frozen yogurt.

53:10.159 --> 53:12.661
Like the old days on the Playa.

53:12.663 --> 53:14.666
- What?
- On the Playa Tortugas.

53:16.132 --> 53:17.833
Oh, oh.

53:17.835 --> 53:20.802
Right. Yeah, the sunsets.

53:20.804 --> 53:23.804
- Yeah.
- Yes. Good times.

53:23.806 --> 53:26.407
I couldn't remember
which flavors we liked,

53:26.409 --> 53:28.242
so I got an assortment.

53:28.244 --> 53:30.614
Thanks. This was

53:31.181 --> 53:33.148
really nice of you.

53:33.150 --> 53:36.688
I know I haven't been the
easiest to live with lately,

53:37.788 --> 53:40.856
but I'm gonna try
a little harder.

53:40.858 --> 53:45.129
I can't promise a lot harder,
but maybe I'll surprise myself.

53:46.929 --> 53:48.966
Well, keep doing this.

53:50.099 --> 53:52.737
Maybe next time,
bring some toppings.

53:55.139 --> 53:56.737
Mmm.

53:56.739 --> 53:58.742
Mango. I love mango.

53:59.777 --> 54:00.979
Have I always loved mango?

54:02.780 --> 54:04.146
As long as I've known you.

54:04.148 --> 54:05.617
Ah, yes.

54:07.684 --> 54:09.150
When we were young

54:09.152 --> 54:11.221
and couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

54:18.228 --> 54:19.760
No.

54:19.762 --> 54:20.896
Okay.

54:20.898 --> 54:24.099
Well... I'll be in my shed.

54:24.101 --> 54:25.803
Trying to have a good attitude.

54:26.269 --> 54:28.038
Just me and the spiders.

54:28.871 --> 54:29.873
Oh.

54:31.474 --> 54:32.876
Forgot my bathroom.

54:36.780 --> 54:38.650
Whew. Whew!

55:22.025 --> 55:26.894
I'm calling to get a death
certificate for Leonardo Montenegro.

55:26.896 --> 55:29.232
He died a couple of weeks ago
in a shark attack.

55:31.201 --> 55:34.970
Yes. An attack by a shark fish?

55:34.972 --> 55:36.771
I think I'm saying
that correctly.

55:50.286 --> 55:52.022
Montenegro.

55:58.262 --> 55:59.297
Burro.

56:00.030 --> 56:01.032
Burrito.

56:09.373 --> 56:10.742
Hey! Hey!

56:23.253 --> 56:25.186
- Thanks, Bobby.
- You got it, bro.

56:26.856 --> 56:28.055
- All right.
- Hey!

56:28.057 --> 56:29.257
- Hey!
- Hey, sweetie!

56:29.259 --> 56:30.260
<i>Bueno.</i>

56:31.094 --> 56:33.028
Oi, remember Hasselbeck.

56:33.030 --> 56:35.767
He's way more mobile
than people give him credit for.

56:37.400 --> 56:39.133
Hey.

56:39.135 --> 56:42.840
- Why aren't you riding?
- It's no fun with training wheels.

56:45.309 --> 56:47.175
I never taught you
to ride a bike?

56:47.177 --> 56:50.177
It's okay. Some dads
can't be around that much.

56:50.179 --> 56:51.782
No, it's not okay.

56:53.150 --> 56:56.050
I'm gonna fix this. Right now.

56:56.052 --> 56:57.788
Let me just put this away. Okay?

56:59.956 --> 57:01.856
What are you doing here?

57:01.858 --> 57:04.025
They got us working bankers'
hours today.

57:04.027 --> 57:05.193
Whatever those are.

57:05.195 --> 57:08.396
So then it's cool if you
watch those guys,

57:08.398 --> 57:10.197
so I can go to the pool?

57:10.199 --> 57:11.935
Yeah, sure. Why not?

57:12.335 --> 57:13.370
Thanks, Dad.

57:15.038 --> 57:17.238
- Hey, Mom.
<i>- You're gonna be blown away.</i>

57:17.240 --> 57:21.909
<i>Modern Senior</i> magazine said
my performance stole the show.

57:21.911 --> 57:25.246
And the Saint Jude wellness
newsletter featured me on the cover.

57:25.248 --> 57:28.316
That certainly justifies
leaving me without childcare.

57:28.318 --> 57:29.483
Life's short, Kate.

57:29.485 --> 57:31.318
You gotta do
what makes you happy.

57:31.320 --> 57:32.519
<i>I don't wanna have regrets</i>

57:32.521 --> 57:35.090
<i>just because I didn't do
what I wanted to do.</i>

57:35.092 --> 57:36.391
<i>You'll understand
someday, honey.</i>

57:36.393 --> 57:38.193
Shit! I gotta go, Mom.

57:38.195 --> 57:39.961
Everyone's looking.

57:39.963 --> 57:41.061
I don't care!

57:41.063 --> 57:45.367
I asked you for one month,
just watch your sisters.

57:45.369 --> 57:48.103
And we don't even know
anything about this guy.

57:48.105 --> 57:50.405
Whose fault is that? I didn't
bring him into the house.

57:50.407 --> 57:52.039
That's not the point.

57:52.041 --> 57:54.045
And I'll tell you why
in two minutes.

58:00.983 --> 58:03.150
We're not done
talking about this!

58:03.152 --> 58:05.686
And because of you,
their pizza was cold

58:05.688 --> 58:07.488
and they gave me a lousy tip.

58:07.490 --> 58:10.460
Maybe you got a bad tip
because you run like a duck.

58:11.695 --> 58:14.061
You better hope
everything's okay.

58:14.063 --> 58:17.432
I hate this. I hate this
whole thing. It's so stupid.

58:21.405 --> 58:23.271
I love the Seahawks!

58:23.273 --> 58:26.240
Our team just ran the ball
to the finish line.

58:26.242 --> 58:27.409
The end zone.
We've been over this.

58:27.411 --> 58:30.045
Oh, right. Touchdown.

58:30.047 --> 58:31.479
It's coming back slowly.

58:31.481 --> 58:35.249
See, Mom, everything's fine.
No one died.

58:35.251 --> 58:39.155
Oh, and, Kate, I got some of the guys
to help me fix that leak in the roof.

58:40.123 --> 58:42.023
And you unpacked the boxes?

58:42.025 --> 58:45.126
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And I found these pillows.

58:45.128 --> 58:47.228
The couch needed
a splash of color.

58:49.166 --> 58:50.331
What?

58:50.333 --> 58:53.937
"Little by little, the bird
builds its nest." It's French.

58:54.438 --> 58:56.440
Wait. I speak French.

58:57.574 --> 58:59.043
Why do I speak French?

59:00.277 --> 59:01.443
Uh...

59:01.445 --> 59:05.112
Well, you were a tour guide,

59:05.114 --> 59:09.117
and it's well-known
that Parisians love Cancun.

59:09.119 --> 59:13.391
For it's chips and salsa
and its flamenco dancers.

59:15.525 --> 59:18.226
Thanks for humiliating me
for nothing.

59:18.228 --> 59:22.296
Hey! Hey, we had a deal,
and you didn't stick to it.

59:22.298 --> 59:23.298
You're grounded.

59:23.300 --> 59:26.568
Who cares? I'm basically
a prisoner here anyway!

59:26.570 --> 59:29.073
- For a week!
- Kate, Kate, Kate. Hey.

59:30.139 --> 59:32.106
Can I talk to you for a sec?

59:32.108 --> 59:35.445
Okay, listen, you remember
what it's like to be 13.

59:36.445 --> 59:39.046
I don't, but you probably do.

59:39.048 --> 59:40.447
What are you getting at?

59:40.449 --> 59:42.117
And no phone!

59:42.119 --> 59:45.086
Hey, hey, I just think
maybe you're being...

59:45.088 --> 59:47.222
I don't know,
a little hard on her.

59:47.224 --> 59:49.324
Don't tell me how
to raise my kids.

59:49.326 --> 59:51.329
"Your kids"?

59:52.061 --> 59:53.293
"Your kids"?

59:53.295 --> 59:54.429
Hey. Listen.

59:54.431 --> 59:58.032
Just because those girls
were not conceived with my seed,

59:58.034 --> 01:00:00.434
doesn't make me any less
their father or a man.

01:00:00.436 --> 01:00:01.503
Of course not. I just...

01:00:01.505 --> 01:00:03.470
I'm not done.

01:00:03.472 --> 01:00:07.175
All I do is work and work
and slave for this family.

01:00:07.177 --> 01:00:09.309
I may not have put us
in the lap of luxury,

01:00:09.311 --> 01:00:10.981
but I'm a provider.

01:00:11.581 --> 01:00:14.249
What you said was a low blow.

01:00:14.251 --> 01:00:18.485
An unfair and hurtful low blow.

01:00:18.487 --> 01:00:21.391
- Honey, I...
- Low blow.

01:00:22.525 --> 01:00:24.124
I need some air.

01:00:25.628 --> 01:00:27.030
Leo!

01:00:29.632 --> 01:00:31.231
Right after I check the score.

01:00:31.233 --> 01:00:33.503
<i>And it is good!</i>

01:00:35.304 --> 01:00:38.072
- We lost.
- <i>A stunning win for Arizona.</i>

01:00:38.074 --> 01:00:39.275
I hope you're happy.

01:00:40.409 --> 01:00:43.144
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

01:00:43.146 --> 01:00:45.213
And not because
I don't remember, hmm?

01:00:45.215 --> 01:00:47.284
Because I don't know.

01:00:53.356 --> 01:00:55.657
My name is Leo
and I'm an alcoholic.

01:00:55.659 --> 01:00:57.425
Hi, Leo.

01:00:57.427 --> 01:01:00.295
To be honest, I don't really
remember my drinking days.

01:01:00.297 --> 01:01:02.162
- Yep.
- Been there.

01:01:02.164 --> 01:01:05.133
I got in a fight
with my wife tonight.

01:01:05.135 --> 01:01:08.172
I stood outside a bar
for 20 minutes.

01:01:09.672 --> 01:01:13.176
I came this close. This...

01:01:16.213 --> 01:01:17.545
But here I am.

01:01:17.547 --> 01:01:20.315
- Keep coming back.
- One day at a time.

01:01:20.317 --> 01:01:24.184
<i>♪ Bloody stools
Bloody stools, bloody stools</i>

01:01:24.186 --> 01:01:27.190
<i>♪ Antiplatelet, bloody stools ♪</i>

01:01:29.291 --> 01:01:30.891
Holy shit!

01:01:36.432 --> 01:01:39.333
Leonardo Montenegro.

01:01:39.335 --> 01:01:42.737
Yeah, he was murdered by a shark in
your district several weeks ago.

01:01:42.739 --> 01:01:43.871
<i>Sorry, ma'am.</i>

01:01:43.873 --> 01:01:46.441
Haven't had a shark attack
around here in four years.

01:01:46.443 --> 01:01:47.508
<i>Really?</i>

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:50.244
Don't you have to check
with other police stations?

01:01:50.246 --> 01:01:51.679
<i>Lady, I promise you,</i>

01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:53.680
if anyone's gonna hear
about a shark attack,

01:01:53.682 --> 01:01:55.152
it's gonna be me.

01:01:56.219 --> 01:01:57.387
Good luck to you.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.322
Hmm.

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.229
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:07.197 --> 01:02:08.199
Um...

01:02:09.199 --> 01:02:10.201
Sorry about tonight.

01:02:11.233 --> 01:02:12.566
I'm the one
who should apologize.

01:02:12.568 --> 01:02:16.637
No, I really need to keep
my side of the street clean

01:02:16.639 --> 01:02:20.243
and, you know, cultivate
an attitude of gratitude.

01:02:21.677 --> 01:02:26.213
I overreacted. I talked
to Emily and ungrounded her.

01:02:26.215 --> 01:02:28.550
I'm just so stressed out
about this test.

01:02:28.552 --> 01:02:31.219
Well, you've been
working so hard and...

01:02:32.355 --> 01:02:33.487
I got it.

01:02:33.489 --> 01:02:36.392
And I've been thinking
how I can help.

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.358
So I talked to Theresa

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.597
and she's okay with me
picking up a few of your shifts.

01:02:41.797 --> 01:02:44.365
- Really? You'd do that for me?
- Yeah.

01:02:44.367 --> 01:02:45.465
I'm not being selfless.

01:02:45.467 --> 01:02:47.538
I'm just thinking
of myself less.

01:02:48.538 --> 01:02:50.405
You like it with milk, right?

01:02:50.407 --> 01:02:51.542
And a little sugar.

01:02:53.376 --> 01:02:56.476
Oh, and I'll take the kids
all day Sunday so you can study.

01:02:56.478 --> 01:02:57.681
By yourself? I can't let...

01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:02.416
Actually, that would be amazing.

01:03:02.418 --> 01:03:04.284
Great.

01:03:04.286 --> 01:03:06.521
I was also thinking
that I should... Oh! Ah!

01:03:06.523 --> 01:03:09.423
Sharp knife. Blood. Blood.
Lots of blood.

01:03:09.425 --> 01:03:10.425
- I do not like blood.
- All right.

01:03:10.427 --> 01:03:12.559
All right, take it easy. You're okay.

01:03:12.561 --> 01:03:14.295
- Let me see, let me see.
- Help.

01:03:14.297 --> 01:03:15.630
I'm just gonna wash it off.

01:03:15.632 --> 01:03:17.565
Feeling queasy. Gonna faint.

01:03:17.567 --> 01:03:18.766
No. You're not gonna faint.

01:03:18.768 --> 01:03:20.334
- I'm fainting.
- No.

01:03:20.336 --> 01:03:21.369
The room is spinning.

01:03:21.371 --> 01:03:23.838
All right, let's just
sit you down over here.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.740
How bad is it?

01:03:25.742 --> 01:03:27.708
Should I go to the hospital?
Do I need a tourniquet?

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:30.577
Relax. You are
with a trained professional.

01:03:30.579 --> 01:03:32.313
- Do I need stitches?
- No.

01:03:32.315 --> 01:03:34.451
Please help me.
I'm bleeding to death.

01:03:35.284 --> 01:03:36.818
Oh, God! It's really deep.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.320
What the hell are you doing?

01:03:39.322 --> 01:03:42.322
Cleaning the cut.
My God, you're such a baby!

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.559
I got this.

01:03:44.561 --> 01:03:46.260
I took a whole class on it.

01:03:46.262 --> 01:03:47.362
Dressing wounds?

01:03:47.364 --> 01:03:49.563
Dealing with
hysterical patients.

01:03:53.469 --> 01:03:54.504
All right.

01:03:55.472 --> 01:03:56.473
Okay.

01:03:57.407 --> 01:03:58.442
There.

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:09.219
You have very good
bedside manner.

01:04:10.853 --> 01:04:12.619
- You think so?
- Yeah.

01:04:12.621 --> 01:04:14.554
Sometimes I worry about that.

01:04:14.556 --> 01:04:16.659
No. No, you're a natural.

01:04:19.295 --> 01:04:23.266
All right. There you go.
Good as new.

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.476
Well, um...

01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:35.746
I guess I'll let you study.

01:04:37.447 --> 01:04:39.717
Thanks for taking
such good care of me.

01:04:43.485 --> 01:04:44.487
Okay.

01:04:51.594 --> 01:04:52.596
Good night.

01:04:54.396 --> 01:04:55.398
Wait.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.800
You can sleep inside.
Downstairs, on the couch.

01:05:02.438 --> 01:05:04.274
You've made me very happy.

01:05:40.744 --> 01:05:42.913
We'll pick you up
after the game, hmm?

01:05:44.847 --> 01:05:46.349
You're welcome!

01:05:49.952 --> 01:05:52.619
Why can't we go swimming?

01:05:52.621 --> 01:05:54.722
We're giving your sister
a little space.

01:06:01.831 --> 01:06:03.563
Too much space.

01:06:03.565 --> 01:06:04.934
We're giving her too much space.

01:06:06.802 --> 01:06:08.001
Everyone's watching.

01:06:08.003 --> 01:06:09.237
I don't care!

01:06:09.239 --> 01:06:13.574
I don't have to listen to you.
You're not even my real dad.

01:06:13.576 --> 01:06:16.610
What? Your mother told you?

01:06:16.612 --> 01:06:18.579
Well, I'm still not letting
you throw your life away

01:06:18.581 --> 01:06:21.883
for some sex-crazed,
curly-haired wolf.

01:06:21.885 --> 01:06:24.788
That boy wants one thing
and one thing only.

01:06:25.454 --> 01:06:26.456
He's gay.

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:29.590
Okay. One different thing.

01:06:32.027 --> 01:06:34.961
What are you doing?
Why are you crying?

01:06:34.963 --> 01:06:36.467
Because I'm miserable.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:37.901
You are?

01:06:38.534 --> 01:06:39.635
Yeah.

01:06:41.771 --> 01:06:43.970
I was really popular
in Portland,

01:06:43.972 --> 01:06:47.708
and here everyone's on group
texts that I'm not a part of.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:49.811
And there's this boy in
my Spanish class that I like,

01:06:49.813 --> 01:06:51.545
but he doesn't know
that I exist.

01:06:51.547 --> 01:06:54.014
And he's friends with the
lifeguard here and that's...

01:06:54.016 --> 01:06:56.419
Wait, you're taking Spanish?

01:06:58.954 --> 01:07:00.054
<i>Muy bien.</i>

01:07:00.056 --> 01:07:02.523
Your pronunciation
is very natural.

01:07:02.525 --> 01:07:04.758
I mean, you still need
to roll the "R's".

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.494
What?

01:07:06.496 --> 01:07:07.894
Say it.

01:07:07.896 --> 01:07:09.996
- You have to... Okay, okay.
- Dad!

01:07:09.998 --> 01:07:12.599
How could he
not know you exist?

01:07:12.601 --> 01:07:15.970
You're a beautiful, smart,
thoughtful young woman.

01:07:15.972 --> 01:07:17.804
He'd be lucky
to be your boyfriend.

01:07:17.806 --> 01:07:20.775
But you're way too young
for a boyfriend.

01:07:20.777 --> 01:07:22.242
They'd all be lucky
to be your boyfriend.

01:07:22.244 --> 01:07:25.012
Every boy here should beg
to be your boyfriend.

01:07:25.014 --> 01:07:28.483
But I forbid it. I forbid it!

01:07:28.485 --> 01:07:32.253
I know I'm all over the map.
It's just...

01:07:32.255 --> 01:07:35.590
It's very confusing
having a daughter.

01:07:35.592 --> 01:07:39.496
Look. I'm not gonna do
anything stupid. All right?

01:07:45.902 --> 01:07:47.438
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:07:56.746 --> 01:07:58.813
Blue 52. Hot route left.

01:07:58.815 --> 01:08:00.113
Hut, hut, hike!

01:08:07.056 --> 01:08:08.856
Yes! Yes!

01:08:08.858 --> 01:08:10.825
Go, go, go. Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:08:10.827 --> 01:08:13.528
Go! Go! Go! Yes!

01:08:14.931 --> 01:08:17.466
Woo-hoo!

01:08:19.068 --> 01:08:21.736
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:08:21.738 --> 01:08:24.807
- Go team! Yeah, we did it!
- That's my daughter.

01:08:25.307 --> 01:08:26.510
We know.

01:08:28.042 --> 01:08:29.676
Second touchdown.

01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:32.013
We're winning, actually.

01:08:32.015 --> 01:08:33.517
Yeah,
we kicked their butts!

01:08:34.917 --> 01:08:37.018
- Thanks for rescuing me.
- Ah.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.022
My mind was
turning into mush.

01:08:40.988 --> 01:08:42.822
Hey, Molly!

01:08:42.823 --> 01:08:45.559
When did you learn how to ride
without training wheels?

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.828
Dad taught me.

01:08:48.898 --> 01:08:50.734
She only fell once.

01:08:52.769 --> 01:08:54.902
Faster! Faster! Faster!

01:08:54.904 --> 01:08:57.148
Come on, come on, come on! Yes, yes, yes!

01:08:57.171 --> 01:08:59.773
Whoo!

01:08:59.774 --> 01:09:01.776
So how do I get rid
of the brain freeze?

01:09:01.778 --> 01:09:03.777
- Go like this.
- Like this?

01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:05.814
Mmm.

01:09:07.716 --> 01:09:09.951
Are you gonna leave us?

01:09:09.953 --> 01:09:12.986
What do you mean?
Of course not. I'm your dad.

01:09:12.988 --> 01:09:15.822
Sometimes dads leave.

01:09:15.823 --> 01:09:18.960
Well, I guess maybe they do,
but I'm not going anywhere.

01:09:18.962 --> 01:09:20.961
You're stuck with me.

01:09:20.962 --> 01:09:22.798
Thank you.

01:09:32.975 --> 01:09:35.209
"A. Sudden weight gain.
B. Abdominal itch.

01:09:35.211 --> 01:09:37.779
"C. Bloody stools. D. Light..."

01:09:39.747 --> 01:09:40.917
Bloody stools.

01:10:05.641 --> 01:10:06.842
<i>Ay,</i> Papa!

01:10:18.954 --> 01:10:20.122
Papa!

01:10:37.273 --> 01:10:38.906
Colin,
were you with Magdalena

01:10:38.908 --> 01:10:40.775
when she identified
my brother's body?

01:10:40.777 --> 01:10:43.777
No, ma'am, she was quite insistent
on handling the matter herself.

01:10:43.779 --> 01:10:45.012
Are you insinuating?

01:10:45.014 --> 01:10:46.046
Are you insinuating?

01:10:46.048 --> 01:10:47.748
Should I be insinuating?

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:48.848
Should I be insinuating?

01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:50.785
And before you answer that,
remember I'm Scottish.

01:10:50.787 --> 01:10:52.018
I can do this all day long.

01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:56.891
Hey! So, the test?

01:10:56.893 --> 01:11:00.160
There was a couple that I blanked
on, but at least it's over.

01:11:00.162 --> 01:11:02.796
Now I don't have
to keep up this insane lie.

01:11:02.798 --> 01:11:05.866
Are you sure you don't wanna wait a
couple of weeks before you tell him?

01:11:05.868 --> 01:11:07.468
I mean, good help
is hard to find.

01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:10.303
Yeah, totally. And the guys are
really starting to like him, too.

01:11:10.305 --> 01:11:12.740
No. No. Fair is fair.
He has paid his debt.

01:11:12.742 --> 01:11:14.107
I have tortured him
long enough.

01:11:14.109 --> 01:11:15.276
Okay.

01:11:15.278 --> 01:11:17.814
You're really gonna hate
doing your own laundry again.

01:11:18.814 --> 01:11:20.216
Guys...

01:11:21.216 --> 01:11:23.718
I feel pretty nervous.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.951
I think he's gonna freak out.

01:11:24.953 --> 01:11:26.254
Freak out?

01:11:26.256 --> 01:11:28.723
Kate, you're telling a ditch digger
he's a billionaire, you know.

01:11:28.725 --> 01:11:30.891
I'm pretty sure
he's gonna be okay with it.

01:11:30.893 --> 01:11:31.927
Yeah.

01:11:36.032 --> 01:11:37.197
Hey.

01:11:37.199 --> 01:11:38.201
Hey.

01:11:39.801 --> 01:11:42.068
Uh, I need to talk to you.

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:44.304
Yeah. What's up?

01:11:44.306 --> 01:11:47.741
I have to confess something,
and I don't know where to start.

01:11:47.743 --> 01:11:49.809
Well, whatever it is,

01:11:49.811 --> 01:11:51.914
I'm sure it's not
that big of a deal.

01:11:52.948 --> 01:11:54.815
- It's pretty big.
- Yeah?

01:11:54.817 --> 01:11:57.688
And this is gonna sound crazy.

01:11:58.787 --> 01:12:02.725
Maybe funny-crazy
or crazy-crazy.

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.925
But I did something terrible.

01:12:05.927 --> 01:12:08.198
Hold that thought.

01:12:09.231 --> 01:12:10.233
Girls!

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.769
Dinner's ready!

01:12:18.073 --> 01:12:20.009
Yeah. Sit down, please.

01:12:22.244 --> 01:12:25.780
- Be careful, it's hot.
- It smells so good.

01:12:25.782 --> 01:12:27.313
- I hope it tastes good.
- It looks so good.

01:12:27.315 --> 01:12:29.251
Use a spoon. Mmm.

01:12:30.819 --> 01:12:32.852
So...

01:12:32.854 --> 01:12:35.224
What's this awful thing
you need to confess?

01:12:37.292 --> 01:12:38.728
I...

01:12:40.962 --> 01:12:43.332
Come on, I'm your husband.
You can tell me anything.

01:12:52.307 --> 01:12:54.842
I forgot it's our anniversary.

01:12:54.844 --> 01:12:56.143
Really?

01:12:56.145 --> 01:12:57.343
Today?

01:12:57.345 --> 01:12:58.981
Happy anniversary!

01:13:00.349 --> 01:13:02.415
We're going out!

01:13:43.125 --> 01:13:44.424
You guys are really good.

01:13:44.426 --> 01:13:46.228
<i>Thanks, bro. Tell my uncle.</i>

01:13:55.171 --> 01:13:57.338
Fifteen years.

01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.943
A lot of couples don't
make it that long.

01:14:00.643 --> 01:14:01.845
Yeah.

01:14:02.444 --> 01:14:04.180
Thanks for sticking with me.

01:14:06.381 --> 01:14:08.484
I know I haven't made
things easy.

01:14:12.387 --> 01:14:14.888
- It's pretty out here.
- Beautiful.

01:14:18.426 --> 01:14:21.961
Do you know what it means when a
ship honks three times like that?

01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:24.868
Someone told me once,
but I forgot.

01:14:26.234 --> 01:14:27.304
Yes, I do.

01:14:28.371 --> 01:14:31.071
It's based on
an old, Spanish legend.

01:14:31.073 --> 01:14:32.673
Yeah.

01:14:32.675 --> 01:14:35.108
Very romantic, by the way.

01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:39.379
You see, there was a poor
housemaid named Catalina.

01:14:39.381 --> 01:14:45.052
She was very pretty and caught the eye
of the colonial governor's son, Arturo.

01:14:45.054 --> 01:14:47.454
Okay, wait. You don't
remember anything,

01:14:47.456 --> 01:14:48.988
yet you remember this?

01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:51.258
It's a very famous legend.

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.960
So, they fell in love.

01:14:52.962 --> 01:14:54.027
Of course.

01:14:54.029 --> 01:14:56.129
But Arturo's father forbade it.

01:14:56.131 --> 01:14:59.700
He couldn't have his only son
running around with a commoner.

01:14:59.702 --> 01:15:04.071
So, he ordered Arturo to return
to Spain, which he did.

01:15:04.073 --> 01:15:07.107
But not before
promising Catalina

01:15:07.109 --> 01:15:09.375
he'd come back
and signal for her

01:15:09.377 --> 01:15:12.148
with three long blasts.

01:15:13.015 --> 01:15:15.049
Just like you heard.

01:15:15.051 --> 01:15:19.152
This sounds suspiciously like one of
the shows the kitchen guys watch.

01:15:19.154 --> 01:15:21.287
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Uh-huh.

01:15:21.289 --> 01:15:25.526
Anyway, a year later,
everything went as planned.

01:15:25.528 --> 01:15:29.028
She swam out,
but the fog was too thick.

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:31.732
He called out,
"Catalina! Catalina!"

01:15:31.734 --> 01:15:34.434
She yelled back,
"Arturo! Arturo!"

01:15:34.436 --> 01:15:37.303
And with that,
he dove into the water.

01:15:37.305 --> 01:15:39.173
They reunited,

01:15:39.175 --> 01:15:41.442
and Catalina, who,
up until that point,

01:15:41.444 --> 01:15:42.977
had been resisting him

01:15:42.979 --> 01:15:45.916
because of some test
she had to study for,

01:15:46.448 --> 01:15:49.251
finally let him kiss her.

01:15:50.319 --> 01:15:51.352
Hmm.

01:15:51.354 --> 01:15:53.320
Oh. Now I remember.

01:15:53.322 --> 01:15:56.190
Three honks means a boat's
about to go in reverse.

01:15:57.993 --> 01:15:59.028
Okay.

01:15:59.462 --> 01:16:01.464
Maybe. Factually.

01:16:02.064 --> 01:16:03.199
But I...

01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:22.985
Was it always this good?

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.523
Every time with you
is like the first time.

01:16:38.067 --> 01:16:39.502
Look at this thing.
We built it.

01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:43.637
Your first pool, bro.

01:16:43.639 --> 01:16:45.272
Good job.

01:16:45.274 --> 01:16:48.107
Hey, look at you,
you got working man hands now.

01:16:48.109 --> 01:16:49.311
Yeah!

01:16:49.578 --> 01:16:51.644
Yes, I do!

01:17:03.826 --> 01:17:05.526
That's good.

01:17:05.528 --> 01:17:08.428
<i>Take that play, get
off the block there by Laken Tomlinson.</i>

01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:12.066
<i>This guy will be a defensive
MVP one day, I guarantee you.</i>

01:17:12.068 --> 01:17:14.003
Dad, what's a pervert?

01:17:17.405 --> 01:17:18.604
Um...

01:17:18.606 --> 01:17:20.473
Well, uh...

01:17:20.475 --> 01:17:22.177
When a man

01:17:23.279 --> 01:17:24.614
has a van...

01:17:26.347 --> 01:17:27.548
Kate!

01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:29.282
Molly has a question for you.

01:17:30.386 --> 01:17:32.419
What is taking them so long?

01:17:32.421 --> 01:17:33.653
Would you relax?

01:17:33.655 --> 01:17:36.255
They said they were gonna post
the results after 2:00 p.m.

01:17:36.257 --> 01:17:37.357
All right. Halftime.

01:17:37.359 --> 01:17:39.526
I'm getting lunch.

01:17:39.528 --> 01:17:41.564
Oh, wait. Where's my list?

01:17:42.331 --> 01:17:43.397
Here.

01:17:43.399 --> 01:17:45.435
Mmm... <i>Ciao.</i>

01:17:47.302 --> 01:17:49.303
Wait! Hey, I forgot.

01:17:49.305 --> 01:17:51.104
Honey!

01:17:51.106 --> 01:17:54.607
Get coleslaw, okay?
And maybe some potato chips.

01:17:54.609 --> 01:17:56.210
Okay, got it.

01:17:56.212 --> 01:17:59.245
Write it down. I know you.
You're gonna forget.

01:17:59.247 --> 01:18:01.581
And get cookies. I want cookies.

01:18:01.583 --> 01:18:03.052
Cookies.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:05.422
Pen.

01:18:14.662 --> 01:18:15.664
Kate!

01:18:17.332 --> 01:18:18.531
What's the matter?

01:18:18.533 --> 01:18:21.668
I don't know.
I was just wondering

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:25.171
what the wife on an
infertile man would be doing

01:18:25.173 --> 01:18:29.445
with a strip of ribbed,
reservoir-tipped Trojans?

01:18:30.345 --> 01:18:31.346
Okay...

01:18:32.213 --> 01:18:34.915
This is not what you think.

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:36.349
It's nothing.

01:18:36.351 --> 01:18:38.418
Nothing? We made a vow.

01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:41.287
A sacred vow,
which I kept, I think.

01:18:41.289 --> 01:18:44.191
And don't assume
I didn't have opportunities,

01:18:44.193 --> 01:18:45.358
because I did.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.630
Lots and lots of them. Probably.

01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:49.595
This is nuts.

01:18:49.597 --> 01:18:51.498
You know what, I'm glad.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.732
I'm glad you found these,

01:18:52.734 --> 01:18:56.105
because I have been trying to
think of a way to tell you this.

01:18:56.438 --> 01:18:57.707
You and I...

01:19:00.309 --> 01:19:02.177
We're not really married.

01:19:03.345 --> 01:19:04.945
Have I not made you happy?

01:19:04.947 --> 01:19:07.214
Yes, but that's not the point.

01:19:07.216 --> 01:19:09.215
I'm not your wife.

01:19:09.217 --> 01:19:12.385
Those kids in there,
they're not your children.

01:19:12.387 --> 01:19:14.157
Oh, this again.

01:19:14.689 --> 01:19:16.255
Low blow.

01:19:16.257 --> 01:19:17.659
All right, come on.
Come on!

01:19:18.293 --> 01:19:20.527
Girls?

01:19:20.529 --> 01:19:24.334
Girls, I just told him the truth,
and I want you to tell him, too.

01:19:27.502 --> 01:19:28.637
Go ahead, tell him.

01:19:30.405 --> 01:19:32.406
Tell him what?

01:19:32.408 --> 01:19:33.676
Tell him he's not your dad.

01:19:34.409 --> 01:19:35.375
But he is our dad?

01:19:35.377 --> 01:19:38.411
No, don't tell him
what I told you to tell him.

01:19:38.413 --> 01:19:40.647
Tell him what really
happened. Emily?

01:19:40.649 --> 01:19:43.282
He got drunk and
blacked out on the beach.

01:19:43.284 --> 01:19:45.285
We were really worried.
I couldn't sleep.

01:19:45.287 --> 01:19:47.286
No, damn it!
Tell him the truth!

01:19:47.288 --> 01:19:49.492
Don't you speak to
my three musketeers like that.

01:19:50.225 --> 01:19:51.460
I've had it.

01:19:54.529 --> 01:19:55.696
What do you think you're doing?

01:19:55.698 --> 01:19:57.697
- We like him.
- We want to keep him.

01:19:57.699 --> 01:20:00.666
You can't keep him.
He doesn't belong to you.

01:20:00.668 --> 01:20:03.704
He didn't belong to you, either,
but that didn't stop you.

01:20:03.706 --> 01:20:07.307
- You know I have my reasons.
- So do we.

01:20:07.309 --> 01:20:10.410
Leo, listen. Look, look, look.
Those condoms aren't Kate's.

01:20:10.412 --> 01:20:11.445
They're mine.

01:20:11.447 --> 01:20:12.545
Don't cover for her.

01:20:12.547 --> 01:20:15.749
No, I'm not.
She's covering for me.

01:20:15.751 --> 01:20:18.718
Yeah. I'm the one
sleeping with the customers.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.254
Really?

01:20:21.256 --> 01:20:24.590
I have a problem, Leo.
I'm obsessed with sex.

01:20:24.592 --> 01:20:25.726
Come on.

01:20:25.728 --> 01:20:28.027
I'm a sex addict!
It's a real thing.

01:20:28.029 --> 01:20:29.362
What are you talking about?

01:20:29.364 --> 01:20:30.597
Kate! I confessed.

01:20:30.599 --> 01:20:32.398
You don't have to lie
for me anymore.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.034
I can finally get
the help I need.

01:20:34.036 --> 01:20:35.736
Now, don't worry.
You don't have to tell Bobby.

01:20:35.738 --> 01:20:37.271
I'll tell him.

01:20:37.273 --> 01:20:38.274
Do you hate me?

01:20:40.576 --> 01:20:41.810
Of course not.

01:20:43.378 --> 01:20:45.215
I know the flesh is weak.

01:20:45.847 --> 01:20:49.516
Hey, one day at a time. Hmm?

01:20:49.518 --> 01:20:50.683
Yeah, one day at a time.

01:20:53.622 --> 01:20:56.526
I'm so sorry I didn't trust you.

01:20:57.693 --> 01:20:59.793
That really scared me.

01:20:59.795 --> 01:21:02.461
It was like my whole life
was a lie.

01:21:02.463 --> 01:21:03.763
Come on,
they're back on the field!

01:21:03.765 --> 01:21:06.500
Hey. Second half's
about to start.

01:21:06.502 --> 01:21:07.622
Mind doing the sandwich run?

01:21:10.872 --> 01:21:12.507
What are you doing?

01:21:13.708 --> 01:21:15.776
I can't keep this up forever.

01:21:15.778 --> 01:21:17.077
Why not?

01:21:17.079 --> 01:21:19.679
Okay, look, I know your relationship's
a little unconventional.

01:21:19.681 --> 01:21:22.683
But whose isn't?
You guys are good together.

01:21:22.685 --> 01:21:24.084
Stop fighting it.

01:21:24.086 --> 01:21:25.451
I'll tell you one thing.

01:21:25.453 --> 01:21:29.089
Pretend or not, Bobby's Latin ego
is not gonna like being cheated on.

01:21:29.091 --> 01:21:30.723
- Kate!
- Shit.

01:21:30.725 --> 01:21:31.728
They told him.

01:21:33.662 --> 01:21:35.431
You passed! You're a nurse!

01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:47.542
Congratulations, Mom!

01:21:57.386 --> 01:21:58.588
- Hike!
- Let's do this.

01:22:06.929 --> 01:22:08.461
- Hey, Gordo.
- Hey.

01:22:08.463 --> 01:22:09.465
You okay?

01:22:10.431 --> 01:22:11.365
Huh? Oh.

01:22:11.367 --> 01:22:13.700
Yeah, well, you know,
I've been better.

01:22:13.702 --> 01:22:14.567
Yeah.

01:22:14.569 --> 01:22:16.602
But this is the
wake-up call we needed.

01:22:16.604 --> 01:22:18.972
I wasn't as attentive to her
needs as I should have been.

01:22:18.974 --> 01:22:21.911
You know, I can be
emotionally remote, bro.

01:22:23.612 --> 01:22:25.512
We're starting couples therapy.

01:22:25.514 --> 01:22:26.716
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:30.717
Just, whatever you do,
you know, don't...

01:22:30.719 --> 01:22:33.422
I'm sorry, take Kate
for granted. Because...

01:22:35.591 --> 01:22:38.724
Look, I know we can be
a little <i>machista.</i>

01:22:38.726 --> 01:22:40.727
- It's our way. Yeah.
- You know?

01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:43.599
But your vulnerability
and honesty really touches me.

01:22:48.604 --> 01:22:49.605
You owe me.

01:22:49.971 --> 01:22:51.937
I know.

01:22:51.939 --> 01:22:54.641
Oh, yeah,
this is a Christmas card.

01:22:54.643 --> 01:22:55.875
Oh, God, it's cold!

01:22:55.877 --> 01:22:57.777
I got you!

01:22:57.779 --> 01:22:59.916
That's him.
The chicken fight guy.

01:24:03.744 --> 01:24:06.479
Hold the ashes!
Sorry, sorry.

01:24:07.582 --> 01:24:08.850
This was taken 20 minutes ago.

01:24:09.885 --> 01:24:11.050
- Leonardo?
- What?

01:24:11.052 --> 01:24:12.854
It's Leonardo!

01:24:24.832 --> 01:24:27.000
Hey, you guys! You guys!

01:24:27.002 --> 01:24:28.968
Before I cut the cake,

01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:31.705
I just want to thank you all
for being here.

01:24:31.707 --> 01:24:34.574
I could not have passed
the test without you all.

01:24:34.576 --> 01:24:36.910
- Nurse Kate!
- Nurse Kate!

01:24:36.912 --> 01:24:38.448
Especially you, Leo.

01:24:38.947 --> 01:24:40.679
He cooked, he cleaned.

01:24:40.681 --> 01:24:43.616
He worked two jobs,
he kept me laughing.

01:24:43.618 --> 01:24:45.085
And if you haven't tried
the empanadas yet,

01:24:45.087 --> 01:24:46.719
they are delicious.
He made them.

01:24:46.721 --> 01:24:47.954
They're gone!

01:24:50.024 --> 01:24:51.590
What, babe?

01:24:51.592 --> 01:24:53.512
They're delicious, bro.

01:24:58.867 --> 01:25:00.503
Wait, wait, wait.

01:25:00.935 --> 01:25:02.001
Wait, wait, wait.

01:25:02.003 --> 01:25:03.602
I want to say something, too.

01:25:03.604 --> 01:25:05.738
I mean, look at this face.

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.307
- Look at this face.
- Oh!

01:25:07.309 --> 01:25:09.942
Isn't this the most beautiful
face you've ever seen?

01:25:09.944 --> 01:25:11.777
Second. Second most beautiful.

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:15.016
She's too good for you!

01:25:16.752 --> 01:25:21.090
And also, I don't remember
the first time I did this,

01:25:22.658 --> 01:25:24.624
and that doesn't feel right.

01:25:24.626 --> 01:25:26.762
So, Kate,

01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:30.563
will you marry me again?

01:25:30.565 --> 01:25:32.501
Holy crap.

01:25:33.769 --> 01:25:34.904
Yeah.

01:25:35.737 --> 01:25:37.836
Yes! Yes, I will!

01:25:37.838 --> 01:25:39.772
- She said yes!
- She said yes!

01:25:41.042 --> 01:25:42.675
That's what
I'm talking about, Leo!

01:25:42.677 --> 01:25:43.777
Go, Mom!

01:25:43.779 --> 01:25:45.678
That's what
I'm talking about, bro!

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.580
That's my boy right there.

01:25:47.582 --> 01:25:49.648
Okay, that's love, baby.

01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:53.687
"'And now, gentlemen, ' said d'Artagnan,
without stopping to explain his conduct,

01:25:53.689 --> 01:25:56.656
"'all for one, and one for all.

01:25:56.658 --> 01:25:58.924
"'That is our motto, is it not?

01:25:58.926 --> 01:26:00.595
"'But still, look here.'"

01:26:43.971 --> 01:26:45.804
Wow.

01:26:45.806 --> 01:26:47.173
Whose fancy car is that?

01:26:47.175 --> 01:26:48.744
That's so cool.

01:27:06.161 --> 01:27:07.697
Hey, Papi!

01:27:08.130 --> 01:27:09.763
Sofia!

01:27:09.765 --> 01:27:10.863
Hi, Magda!

01:27:10.865 --> 01:27:12.665
Let me just drop this
in the house.

01:27:12.667 --> 01:27:13.735
Hey.

01:27:37.091 --> 01:27:38.094
Papi.

01:27:38.859 --> 01:27:39.862
Sofia.

01:27:40.796 --> 01:27:42.731
Magda.

01:27:43.731 --> 01:27:45.100
Oh, my God, I remember.

01:27:46.702 --> 01:27:48.738
I'm Leonardo Montenegro.

01:27:49.738 --> 01:27:51.039
Kate!

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.205
I'm cured!

01:27:53.207 --> 01:27:55.909
The doctor said my memory
could come back suddenly,

01:27:55.911 --> 01:27:57.710
and he was right.

01:27:57.712 --> 01:28:00.213
I mean, I saw Papi...

01:28:00.215 --> 01:28:03.016
I walked past him into
the house and poof!

01:28:03.018 --> 01:28:04.183
It came back!

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:08.220
Honey, ask me anything.

01:28:08.222 --> 01:28:11.090
Ask me about my childhood
in Mexico City.

01:28:11.092 --> 01:28:13.793
About my car collection.

01:28:13.795 --> 01:28:15.227
About my money.

01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:17.766
Money. I have money!

01:28:18.833 --> 01:28:21.934
Lots and lots of money.

01:28:21.936 --> 01:28:24.140
This is the happiest day
of my life!

01:28:27.175 --> 01:28:28.177
Wait.

01:28:32.814 --> 01:28:34.150
You're not my wife.

01:28:36.083 --> 01:28:37.787
Why would you make me think...

01:28:40.822 --> 01:28:42.123
Why would you do that to me?

01:28:45.926 --> 01:28:47.228
I know why.

01:28:49.797 --> 01:28:54.703
You're that awful carpet cleaner
lady who hates me.

01:28:57.372 --> 01:28:58.841
And...

01:28:59.841 --> 01:29:02.976
And these are your kids

01:29:02.978 --> 01:29:04.913
and you made me believe...

01:29:07.114 --> 01:29:08.117
Oh, God.

01:29:09.818 --> 01:29:11.119
Oh, God.

01:29:12.554 --> 01:29:14.056
You tricked me.

01:29:15.323 --> 01:29:16.826
You used me.

01:29:17.192 --> 01:29:18.258
Leo...

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:19.826
No, no, no.

01:29:19.828 --> 01:29:21.097
My name is not Leo.

01:29:21.997 --> 01:29:23.199
It's Leonardo.

01:29:25.065 --> 01:29:27.068
And I don't belong with you.

01:29:31.072 --> 01:29:32.274
And I don't belong with them.

01:29:41.349 --> 01:29:42.885
I'll get my things.

01:30:12.146 --> 01:30:13.882
There's nothing
in there that's mine.

01:30:17.918 --> 01:30:19.320
For what it's worth...

01:30:20.421 --> 01:30:21.956
I'm sorry.

01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:23.925
And...

01:30:25.193 --> 01:30:26.996
And thank you.

01:30:39.341 --> 01:30:40.342
Hey.

01:30:57.458 --> 01:30:58.991
Girls.

01:30:58.993 --> 01:31:00.125
Don't go!

01:31:00.127 --> 01:31:02.661
Dad! Dad! Don't go.

01:31:02.663 --> 01:31:05.231
Dad! Dad!

01:31:05.233 --> 01:31:06.268
Dad!

01:31:07.068 --> 01:31:08.101
Dad!

01:31:08.103 --> 01:31:10.236
No! Don't go, don't go!

01:31:10.238 --> 01:31:11.407
Wait, no.

01:31:16.478 --> 01:31:17.846
Daddy!

01:31:19.247 --> 01:31:20.883
Daddy, wait!

01:32:05.993 --> 01:32:07.293
Welcome back, sir.

01:32:07.295 --> 01:32:09.163
Your funeral was lovely,
by the way.

01:32:18.472 --> 01:32:21.240
I liked Dad's sauce better.

01:32:21.242 --> 01:32:23.308
Sweetie, you know
he was never really your dad.

01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:25.277
You should have tried
to stop him.

01:32:25.279 --> 01:32:27.080
What was I gonna say?

01:32:27.082 --> 01:32:30.249
I lied to him.
I basically kidnapped the man.

01:32:30.251 --> 01:32:34.023
So what? You're obviously
totally in love with him.

01:32:35.055 --> 01:32:36.356
What does it matter now?

01:32:36.358 --> 01:32:38.057
He's back to his old life,

01:32:38.059 --> 01:32:41.463
with his servants
and supermodels.

01:32:42.997 --> 01:32:44.065
It's over.

01:32:45.132 --> 01:32:48.938
Now finish up, 'cause
Grandma can't wait to see ya.

01:34:05.447 --> 01:34:07.016
No, I don't drink.

01:34:10.385 --> 01:34:13.489
Wait, wait. I do drink.

01:34:14.588 --> 01:34:15.554
Fill her up, Colin!

01:34:15.556 --> 01:34:18.191
Yes, that was definitely
my recollection, sir.

01:34:18.193 --> 01:34:20.860
- Give me the bottle.
- Ah, what was I thinking?

01:34:40.648 --> 01:34:42.682
This is horrifying.

01:34:47.255 --> 01:34:48.623
Why is she doing this?

01:34:50.358 --> 01:34:53.429
Because life's short, and you
don't wanna have regrets.

01:35:00.268 --> 01:35:01.534
Come on. We're getting Leo.

01:35:01.536 --> 01:35:02.634
Yay!

01:35:02.636 --> 01:35:05.470
Excuse us. Diarrhea. Excuse us.

01:35:05.472 --> 01:35:06.705
Where are you going?

01:35:06.707 --> 01:35:08.347
- I'll call you.
- Yes, yes, yes!

01:35:10.612 --> 01:35:12.213
Hurry up,
we gotta catch him.

01:35:19.487 --> 01:35:21.153
Sir, you should have called me.

01:35:21.155 --> 01:35:22.354
I'd have gotten that for you.

01:35:22.356 --> 01:35:24.557
You know, it's funny.

01:35:24.559 --> 01:35:26.659
I've had this boat for 10 years,

01:35:26.661 --> 01:35:29.629
and I don't think
I ever stepped foot in here.

01:35:29.631 --> 01:35:31.563
Well, that's because
you have people

01:35:31.565 --> 01:35:33.432
to take care
of everything for you.

01:35:33.434 --> 01:35:36.701
You know, when I was
working construction,

01:35:36.703 --> 01:35:39.472
I hated rich assholes like me.

01:35:39.474 --> 01:35:40.673
Hmm.

01:35:40.675 --> 01:35:43.742
Did you hate me, Colin?
You can be honest.

01:35:43.744 --> 01:35:46.411
Well. If I may
remind you, sir,

01:35:46.413 --> 01:35:49.615
the reason I got this job was because
the last steward was honest.

01:35:49.617 --> 01:35:52.121
Eh.

01:35:53.654 --> 01:35:55.123
Can I confess something?

01:35:55.489 --> 01:35:56.492
Hmm.

01:35:58.525 --> 01:36:01.529
I'm not exactly sure
where I fit in anymore.

01:36:02.462 --> 01:36:03.465
Is that crazy?

01:36:05.667 --> 01:36:10.635
Most of us only know the world
that we're born into.

01:36:10.637 --> 01:36:14.510
You've had the privilege of seeing life
from an entirely different perspective.

01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:17.276
Yeah, I did.

01:36:17.278 --> 01:36:18.547
And it sucked, didn't it?

01:36:26.453 --> 01:36:27.553
What's up, Kate?

01:36:27.555 --> 01:36:29.557
Bobby, we need your boat!

01:36:30.625 --> 01:36:33.326
You hear that?
She needs my boat.

01:36:33.328 --> 01:36:34.463
She needs it.

01:37:46.768 --> 01:37:49.402
"There was hope
a Mexico City woman

01:37:49.404 --> 01:37:52.274
"yachting nearby
might be his sister."

01:38:20.501 --> 01:38:22.181
Three.

01:38:22.502 --> 01:38:24.672
Three! That's Kate!

01:38:25.739 --> 01:38:27.473
That's Kate.

01:38:27.475 --> 01:38:29.541
Leonardo.

01:38:29.543 --> 01:38:31.313
Move away, Captain.

01:38:41.823 --> 01:38:44.559
Arturo! Arturo!

01:38:45.359 --> 01:38:48.693
Catalina! Catalina!

01:38:52.899 --> 01:38:55.835
- They're turning!
- Mom! Mom! Mom!

01:38:55.837 --> 01:38:58.403
They're turning around.
Why are they turning around?

01:38:58.405 --> 01:39:00.138
- I don't know.
- Bobby, do something.

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:01.676
No, no, no!

01:39:02.542 --> 01:39:03.612
Papa!

01:39:13.954 --> 01:39:15.754
Come on,
come on, we're losing them!

01:39:15.756 --> 01:39:16.921
Can't this thing go any faster?

01:39:16.923 --> 01:39:18.557
No, it's a leisure boat, babe!

01:39:18.559 --> 01:39:19.791
Just admit you overpaid.

01:39:19.793 --> 01:39:20.992
Okay, okay, I overpaid!

01:39:20.994 --> 01:39:22.727
We're never gonna catch them.

01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:24.249
I should have sprung
for the 40-footer.

01:39:27.601 --> 01:39:29.602
I'm sorry, Kate.
There's nothing I can do.

01:39:43.417 --> 01:39:45.718
I love you, Kate!

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:48.423
I love you, too!

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:00.669
What's he doing?

01:40:03.837 --> 01:40:06.640
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa! That was amazing!

01:40:10.211 --> 01:40:11.651
Man overboard!

01:40:17.984 --> 01:40:20.218
- What? Kate!
- Mom!

01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:21.553
- Mom!
- Kate.

01:40:21.555 --> 01:40:23.488
I'm coming!

01:40:23.490 --> 01:40:26.459
Mom! What are you doing?

01:40:26.461 --> 01:40:28.861
What are you waiting for? Get the dinghy!

01:40:28.863 --> 01:40:30.143
Get the dinghy, bro!

01:40:31.599 --> 01:40:33.933
I never want to be
apart from you!

01:40:33.935 --> 01:40:36.438
I'll never
let you go again!

01:40:40.475 --> 01:40:41.595
Leonardo!

01:40:48.548 --> 01:40:51.708
Never actually been in this thing, bro.

01:41:15.909 --> 01:41:17.645
Mom! What is he doing?

01:41:18.712 --> 01:41:19.911
I don't know!

01:41:19.913 --> 01:41:21.746
I'm negotiating!

01:41:21.748 --> 01:41:23.715
Kate, get in here!
You're gonna drown. Come on!

01:41:26.787 --> 01:41:27.789
Leo!

01:41:59.886 --> 01:42:01.789
Honey, are you coming?

01:42:08.895 --> 01:42:10.896
This is not how I envisioned
this moment.

01:42:10.898 --> 01:42:12.964
I know. I know.

01:42:12.966 --> 01:42:15.701
It's just that most people
don't actually

01:42:15.703 --> 01:42:17.769
have to choose between
love and money.

01:42:17.771 --> 01:42:19.573
It's not easy.

01:42:38.059 --> 01:42:41.192
It's easy. I choose you.

01:42:41.194 --> 01:42:43.661
<i>Oye,</i> Leo, you're giving up
a lot, dude.

01:42:43.663 --> 01:42:46.632
No one would begrudge you if you
wanted to take a few minutes.

01:42:46.634 --> 01:42:47.967
Bobby, would you stay
out of this?

01:42:47.969 --> 01:42:48.934
What? I'm just saying!

01:42:48.936 --> 01:42:51.669
Love fades, okay?
I mean, it's wonderful.

01:42:51.671 --> 01:42:54.005
But some of the excitement
goes away. Now, money...

01:42:54.007 --> 01:42:56.174
Bobby! Shut the hell up!

01:42:56.176 --> 01:42:59.077
- You shut up, babe!
- Yeah! Shut the hell up!

01:42:59.079 --> 01:43:00.649
Kate, listen.

01:43:01.849 --> 01:43:04.049
My life was richer
when I was poor with you

01:43:04.051 --> 01:43:05.854
than when I had all the money
in the world.

01:43:09.155 --> 01:43:11.156
If I jump back in the water,

01:43:11.158 --> 01:43:13.726
will you promise
to kiss me this time?

01:43:13.728 --> 01:43:14.762
Yes.

01:43:31.412 --> 01:43:32.646
Go, Kate!

01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:35.680
<i>Ay.</i>

01:43:46.661 --> 01:43:47.960
Go, Mom!

01:43:58.905 --> 01:44:00.973
Lunches are done!

01:44:00.975 --> 01:44:02.875
Bobby's picking me up in five.

01:44:02.877 --> 01:44:05.143
All right. You sure you can pick
up the girls from school today?

01:44:05.145 --> 01:44:06.978
- Uh, yeah.
- I got it.

01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:08.813
Emily, tell him I'm coming.

01:44:08.815 --> 01:44:09.815
Yes.

01:44:09.817 --> 01:44:11.717
Then I'll drop Olivia
at football practice,

01:44:11.719 --> 01:44:12.886
but you have to pick her up.

01:44:14.154 --> 01:44:16.888
- Colin?
- Hello again.

01:44:16.890 --> 01:44:19.124
What on Earth?

01:44:20.927 --> 01:44:22.663
Hey, come here.

01:44:23.130 --> 01:44:24.295
What are you doing here?

01:44:24.297 --> 01:44:25.464
I was hoping you might
be in the market

01:44:25.466 --> 01:44:29.034
for a top-notch, Scottish nanny
with excellent references.

01:44:29.036 --> 01:44:30.803
You know I'd love that,

01:44:30.805 --> 01:44:33.205
but there's no way
we can afford you.

01:44:33.207 --> 01:44:35.206
Well, in fact you can, sir.

01:44:35.208 --> 01:44:36.875
Sofia sent me back
with the yacht.

01:44:36.877 --> 01:44:37.809
She wanted to remind you

01:44:37.811 --> 01:44:40.778
it was a birthday present
from your father.

01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:43.717
The deed is in your name.
It's still yours.

01:44:45.786 --> 01:44:47.986
Oh, my God.

01:44:47.988 --> 01:44:49.824
You mean I can sell it?

01:44:50.858 --> 01:44:52.156
It must be worth a fortune.

01:44:52.158 --> 01:44:53.795
Over 60 million.

01:44:57.832 --> 01:44:58.833
Pesos?

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:01.970
God, no, ma'am. Dollars.

01:45:03.837 --> 01:45:04.937
Oh.

01:45:19.886 --> 01:45:23.254
By the power invested in me
by the Royal Norwegian Navy,

01:45:23.256 --> 01:45:25.759
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:45:32.533 --> 01:45:34.936
- Go, Mom!
- Go, Mom!

01:45:36.203 --> 01:45:37.839
Go, Dad!

01:46:18.112 --> 01:46:19.210
<i>Okay.</i>

01:46:19.212 --> 01:46:21.379
Before I toast the happy couple,

01:46:21.381 --> 01:46:23.882
let me just dispel a few rumors

01:46:23.884 --> 01:46:25.017
that have been floating around

01:46:25.019 --> 01:46:27.119
about me being cheated on.

01:46:27.121 --> 01:46:31.123
Never happened. Okay?
Not once, not ever.

01:46:31.125 --> 01:46:34.061
There's just so much
I wanna say.

01:46:34.595 --> 01:46:36.164
But I'm not a poet.

01:46:36.930 --> 01:46:39.130
I don't have words.

01:46:39.132 --> 01:46:40.902
I have music.

01:46:51.244 --> 01:46:55.046
I'm so sorry I couldn't
be there to celebrate with you.

01:46:55.048 --> 01:46:58.183
But I'm here in the Philippines,

01:46:58.185 --> 01:47:01.986
spearheading the Montenegros'
Children's Education Initiative,

01:47:01.988 --> 01:47:05.424
and, oh, I've been here
helping these kids

01:47:05.426 --> 01:47:10.062
have a happier, better life,
and they adore me.

01:47:10.064 --> 01:47:12.296
- Right?
- No.

01:47:12.298 --> 01:47:13.432
When we first met,

01:47:13.434 --> 01:47:15.467
I was the catch. Okay?

01:47:15.469 --> 01:47:17.436
I was the football player.

01:47:17.438 --> 01:47:19.170
I was the quarterback,
all right?

01:47:19.172 --> 01:47:20.638
She didn't even make
cheerleader.

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:22.307
She was on the spirit squad.

01:47:22.309 --> 01:47:23.978
When I look at Leo...

01:47:25.112 --> 01:47:26.381
When I look at Kate...

01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:31.631
When I look at Leo and Kate...

01:47:44.297 --> 01:47:47.232
Right now, I'm backstage

01:47:47.234 --> 01:47:49.166
at the Golden Pond
Retirement Home,

01:47:49.168 --> 01:47:51.202
about five minutes from curtain.

01:47:51.204 --> 01:47:53.504
I'm playing Hodel
in <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

01:47:53.506 --> 01:47:56.906
And I thought now was a good
time to talk about allowance.

01:48:02.949 --> 01:48:07.119
<i>♪ Leo has the best spaghetti
I ever tasted ♪</i>

01:48:07.121 --> 01:48:09.153
I have never in all my puff
been at a wedding

01:48:09.155 --> 01:48:10.354
where there's been a free bar.

01:48:10.356 --> 01:48:12.491
Usually, at the end, the
tries to settle up the bill.

01:48:12.493 --> 01:48:13.692
And they're,
"Oh, no, I didn't have it.

01:48:13.694 --> 01:48:15.259
"I only had beer,
you"

01:48:15.261 --> 01:48:16.495
There's always a
at a wedding.

01:48:17.997 --> 01:48:19.317
Leonardo.

01:48:29.409 --> 01:48:32.145
Bobby has asked me
to read a prepared statement.

01:48:34.148 --> 01:48:36.214
"I never cheated on my husband.

01:48:36.216 --> 01:48:37.214
"I never would.

01:48:37.216 --> 01:48:39.176
"No woman ever would."

01:48:49.997 --> 01:48:51.495
- Mwah!
- Cheers.

01:48:51.497 --> 01:48:53.130
Mmm.

01:48:53.132 --> 01:48:54.165
Ah!

01:48:54.167 --> 01:48:55.402
Whoo!
