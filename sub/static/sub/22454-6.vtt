00:24.627 --> 00:28.256
Plus it was so cold and wet and boring
in the outfield.

00:28.987 --> 00:32.423
I don't think I've ever seen
a ball that slippery.

00:32.467 --> 00:36.983
It was a difficult catch, Mark.
I wouldn't worry. And it's just softball.

00:37.027 --> 00:39.700
'This is it. All systems are go.

00:39.747 --> 00:43.217
'The apple is ripe,
the cross hairs are centralised. '

00:43.787 --> 00:46.506
Soph, I was... wondering.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.061
Do you... like Indonesian food?

00:49.107 --> 00:50.984
Erm, Thai, I quite like...

00:51.027 --> 00:55.066
'I can't do it. It's too much.
I'm not American. I can't... date.

00:55.107 --> 00:58.497
'Restaurant on a barge?
I might as well propose.

00:58.547 --> 01:01.266
'The pub. That's the English way. '

01:01.307 --> 01:02.899
Why?

01:02.947 --> 01:04.778
Oh, just... Nothing.

01:04.827 --> 01:07.785
Everyone's going to the pub.
You want to...?

01:07.827 --> 01:11.342
The work gang? I don't think so.
Mind if I get changed?

01:11.387 --> 01:13.378
Oh, no, no. Not at all.

01:14.067 --> 01:16.535
'Oh, my God. She's taking off her top.

01:16.587 --> 01:19.101
'This is very promising. Or is it...?

01:19.147 --> 01:21.581
'Would she do this if she fancied me?

01:21.627 --> 01:24.380
'Maybe we're... Oh, God, no, no.

01:24.427 --> 01:26.418
'We're only bloody friends! '

01:28.947 --> 01:32.144
And she gave me
a peck on the cheek. It's a nightmare!

01:32.187 --> 01:34.985
- Mm-hm.
- I've got to close the deal,

01:35.027 --> 01:37.780
ask her out without asking her out.

01:37.827 --> 01:40.819
One step forward, two steps back -
that's the key.

01:40.867 --> 01:44.337
- Mm. Yeah.
- So how was your day?

01:45.067 --> 01:47.058
Oh, fine. Kind of weird.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.144
Mum rang to say
that my Uncle Ray is a bit ill.

01:50.187 --> 01:52.701
- Yeah? Is it serious?
- Dunno.

01:52.747 --> 01:56.296
He's in the hospice
so I guess he's being looked after.

01:56.347 --> 02:00.977
Hospice? You... Jez, you know
what a hospice is, don't you?

02:01.027 --> 02:03.222
Like a hospital but nicer.

02:03.267 --> 02:07.624
A hospice is where people go to...
Who... are terminally ill.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.464
Oh. Right.

02:09.507 --> 02:12.260
Yeah, Mum said he was... what you said.

02:13.307 --> 02:16.185
I'm sure he'll be fine. He's not a quitter.

02:16.227 --> 02:19.299
Well, I have to say, probably not, mate.

02:19.347 --> 02:20.746
Probably not.

02:20.787 --> 02:25.258
No, he won't quit. Do you know
what I fancy now? Some Good Life.

02:25.987 --> 02:27.705
Where's more Good Life?

02:27.747 --> 02:31.979
- '? Sail away, sail away...? '
- Are you going to give him a call?

02:32.027 --> 02:34.257
Ray? No. No.

02:34.307 --> 02:38.186
He'll have people calling him
night and day, probably sick of it.

02:38.227 --> 02:42.061
I thought probably best
to give him some peace and quiet.

02:42.627 --> 02:46.415
- '... inside... '
- You should call him.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.857
'My stomach's in my mouth
and I think, "This isn't good. "'

02:49.907 --> 02:53.582
Good to see you, Uncle Ray.
What you been up to?

02:53.627 --> 02:56.778
Mostly I've been lying in bed
taking painkillers.

02:57.307 --> 02:59.582
Right. Cool.

02:59.627 --> 03:03.256
'Jesus, that wasn't very friendly.
At least I came. '

03:03.307 --> 03:05.616
So, Ray,

03:05.667 --> 03:08.056
Jez tells me you worked on the force.

03:08.107 --> 03:10.223
That's right, Mark. 30 years.

03:10.267 --> 03:11.985
Blimey.

03:12.027 --> 03:16.543
So must be nice getting a bit of support
from your police mates.

03:16.587 --> 03:19.624
The force. You can trust the force,
can't you?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.658
- Yeah.
- 'What's this?

03:21.707 --> 03:25.256
'This is meant to be my visit.
He's hijacking my visit. '

03:25.307 --> 03:27.696
Mostly they just eat me wine gums...

03:27.747 --> 03:32.343
'Come on, say something. Something
not about dying. Something inspiring. '

03:32.387 --> 03:34.184
Yeah.

03:36.067 --> 03:39.662
People can be so funny
when it comes to illness, can't they?

03:39.707 --> 03:42.267
I mean, it's good that you, you know...

03:42.827 --> 03:46.217
Yeah, that's the one upside
of this whole thing.

03:46.267 --> 03:50.624
Rediscovered that little guy with the
crown of thorns and the big old heart.

03:50.667 --> 03:53.101
Yeah, that's really...

03:53.147 --> 03:55.342
a great thing to have, a faith.

03:55.387 --> 03:56.979
Yeah.

03:57.027 --> 03:58.619
Oh, yeah.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.146
Yeah.

04:00.187 --> 04:03.623
'That's nice. Ray's such a nice guy.

04:03.667 --> 04:07.501
'What a shame everything he believes
is total rubbish. '

04:08.947 --> 04:11.256
OK, well, thanks for calling, Mum.

04:11.307 --> 04:13.138
OK, I will. Bye.

04:15.947 --> 04:17.539
Has it...?

04:17.587 --> 04:20.180
- Ray's dead.
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.

04:22.307 --> 04:23.979
Uncle Ray.

04:24.027 --> 04:25.824
Football, ciggies.

04:25.867 --> 04:29.860
He was gonna make me a bow and arrow
that could go through a dustbin.

04:29.907 --> 04:32.467
He never did, of course, but... wow.

04:33.067 --> 04:35.058
Shall I... turn over?

04:35.107 --> 04:37.746
Yeah. Maybe some Newsnight
or something.

04:38.707 --> 04:43.064
I mean, I wish... maybe
the family could come together.

04:43.107 --> 04:45.826
We could campaign against...

04:46.667 --> 04:48.464
or for something.

04:48.507 --> 04:51.465
Maybe a foundation.
The Ray Foundation,

04:51.507 --> 04:55.341
- for Christians and coppers.
- That's a nice idea.

04:55.387 --> 04:58.777
Something positive's
got to come out of all this.

04:58.827 --> 05:01.819
Something.

05:04.547 --> 05:08.699
I guess I just need some comfort.

05:08.747 --> 05:10.738
Why does it have to happen?

05:10.787 --> 05:12.618
Why does death happen?

05:12.667 --> 05:15.659
Shit, I don't even know
which day the binmen come.

05:15.707 --> 05:19.097
'This is pretty low.
Milking Uncle Ray to get a...

05:19.147 --> 05:22.423
'Hey, I'm feeling bad.
Why not get some nooky out of it? '

05:22.467 --> 05:24.617
I just feel so alone, you know?

05:24.667 --> 05:29.377
Sure. It's like after Tony left,
I thought, "This is it, everything's over. "

05:29.427 --> 05:32.225
But then I thought, "Hey, no, sort it out. "

05:32.267 --> 05:34.827
- Buy a juicer.
- Right. But Toni...

05:34.867 --> 05:36.858
You'd better go.

05:36.907 --> 05:39.546
Classified dates
can be uptight about times.

05:39.587 --> 05:43.296
Go. But I really feel that tonight,
I need someone to...

05:43.347 --> 05:44.985
Jeremy, this is a hot one.

05:45.027 --> 05:50.055
He's six foot, he loves movies and walks,
and we totally clicked on the phone.

05:50.107 --> 05:54.578
'How can she be this heartless to
someone who's as upset as I say I am?

05:54.627 --> 05:58.506
'Maybe I am as upset as I say I am,
it's just coming out weird. '

05:58.547 --> 06:03.223
Toni, listen, nothing could make me feel
better about Ray's death.

06:03.267 --> 06:06.464
Except maybe one thing could.

06:06.507 --> 06:09.977
Look, Jeremy, death happens,
people die. Move on.

06:10.027 --> 06:13.144
My dad died when I was three
but it didn't screw me up.

06:13.187 --> 06:15.337
'Right. '

06:15.387 --> 06:19.699
I don't waste my life looking for a man
to fill a dad-shaped hole.

06:22.427 --> 06:26.420
'It's perfect.
Big social occasion but no invites.

06:26.467 --> 06:28.697
'It's not a date but it is.

06:28.747 --> 06:31.056
'What if it all goes right, though?

06:31.107 --> 06:35.419
'What about my massive, freakish balls?
Don't get ahead of yourself. '

06:35.467 --> 06:37.935
- Hey, Soph.
- Hey, Mark, how's it going?

06:37.987 --> 06:41.059
Well, actually,
things have been a bit tough.

06:41.107 --> 06:44.463
- Jeremy's uncle passed away yesterday.
- Oh, no.

06:44.507 --> 06:47.704
- Oh, that is difficult. Is he OK?
- Yeah, bearing up.

06:47.747 --> 06:50.625
But listen, Sophie, I wanted to ask you,

06:50.667 --> 06:52.976
might you be free on Friday?

06:53.027 --> 06:55.700
- For the funeral?
- The funeral?

06:55.747 --> 06:59.376
'Oh, no, shit.
It's not perfect, it's cracked. Piss. '

06:59.427 --> 07:03.022
You don't have to.
I just thought it might be nice if...

07:03.067 --> 07:06.377
No, I'd be honoured.
If you want a friend to go, then...

07:06.427 --> 07:09.942
No, no, not friend. No. As a kind of... date.

07:10.907 --> 07:14.297
I thought afterwards, if you like,
we could go somewhere.

07:14.347 --> 07:17.384
- Won't there be a wake?
- Somewhere like the wake.

07:17.427 --> 07:21.705
Sure. Great.
Erm, er, if that's OK, I'm invited?

07:21.747 --> 07:24.625
That's the beauty. No invites at a funeral.

07:24.667 --> 07:26.897
Right.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.781
"As Jonno let rip
with the stolen Kalashnikov

07:30.827 --> 07:34.376
"and Squarehead fired off
a round of monkey puzzler,

07:34.427 --> 07:37.180
"I looked at the towel-head I'd slotted... "

07:37.227 --> 07:41.300
'Where did they get this guy?
This is a freak show.

07:41.347 --> 07:44.703
'Why am I even here? Why is she here? '

07:44.747 --> 07:49.298
"I didn't stop to think about it long.
We all get slotted sometime. "

07:52.707 --> 07:54.857
Thanks, Keith.

07:54.907 --> 07:58.343
Scorpio Patrol,
Real Life Behind Enemy Lines.

07:58.387 --> 08:00.617
One of my brother's favourites.

08:00.667 --> 08:04.819
Now, whilst no one would suggest
that the faith Ray claimed to find

08:04.867 --> 08:07.097
in those last weeks was only a product...

08:07.147 --> 08:10.696
'I'm glad we stopped going
to Liz's for Christmas.

08:10.747 --> 08:13.341
"'Thanks for the Fairtrade nuts, Auntie. "

08:13.387 --> 08:16.026
'She's loving this. What a stitch-up. '

08:16.067 --> 08:19.696
Now, in the humanist ceremony
at this point,

08:19.747 --> 08:24.184
we like to encourage anyone
who wants to share a thought or memory

08:24.227 --> 08:29.255
or reflection about my brother,
to speak up.

08:30.147 --> 08:32.102
'Words... coming. '

08:33.986 --> 08:37.024
'Hey, yeah. OK.
The sympathy vote. '

08:37.067 --> 08:40.342
'I'm gonna blow this gaff
wide open. '

08:40.386 --> 08:42.298
Er, yeah.

08:42.347 --> 08:47.057
I spent some time with Ray
before he... went.

08:47.107 --> 08:51.578
And I just wanted to say
that I think we should all remember

08:51.627 --> 08:55.666
that Ray, by the end, he loved Jesus.

08:56.587 --> 09:00.899
Now, I know, Liz,
there's no proof for Jesus,

09:00.947 --> 09:04.223
but then there's no proof
for lots of things

09:04.267 --> 09:08.419
like... science or... the stock market.

09:08.467 --> 09:10.537
And we believe in them.

09:10.587 --> 09:15.456
Look, what I'm trying to say is that,
if I was dying, and I decided that

09:15.507 --> 09:20.501
even though I'd never
particularly been into, say...

09:20.547 --> 09:22.139
Enya before

09:22.187 --> 09:26.066
but that now I really, really was into Enya

09:26.107 --> 09:29.816
and that in fact I thought Enya was great

09:29.867 --> 09:32.427
and that Enya died for our sins

09:32.467 --> 09:34.856
and I wanted an Enya-themed funeral

09:34.907 --> 09:39.901
with pictures of Enya
and lots and lots of mentions of... Enya,

09:39.947 --> 09:44.020
then I think it would be
a bit bloody rich for my sister

09:44.067 --> 09:48.106
to ban all mention of Enya
from my funeral.

09:48.147 --> 09:49.944
Yeah?

09:54.667 --> 09:58.262
'Well done, Jez, old mate.
You did him proud.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.298
' Oh, poor Ray.

10:00.347 --> 10:02.099
'He's in there,

10:02.147 --> 10:04.138
'in that cardboard box.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.984
'I can't believe it.

10:06.027 --> 10:08.825
'Shit! This just gets better and better. '

10:08.867 --> 10:11.859
Yeah, I guess it just came from in here.

10:11.907 --> 10:13.625
Or maybe...

10:13.667 --> 10:15.658
- up there?
- Ah, yes.

10:15.707 --> 10:17.220
Yeah?

10:17.267 --> 10:19.542
- Here's to God!
- To God.

10:19.587 --> 10:22.784
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm OK.

10:22.827 --> 10:26.581
I'll be fine.
I've got to be strong for Jeremy.

10:26.627 --> 10:31.576
He was great, wasn't he? Moments like
this make you realise how short life is.

10:31.627 --> 10:36.178
Right. One minute we're alive,
the next we're dead.

10:36.227 --> 10:39.822
Sometimes we're so wrapped up
in the nonsense of life.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.266
Right, yeah.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.697
I mean, if I want an Xbox,
why don't I just get an Xbox?

10:45.707 --> 10:47.698
- Yeah.
- 'You're losing her. '

10:47.747 --> 10:49.703
It's a brief candle.

10:49.747 --> 10:51.817
A bloody brief candle.

10:52.787 --> 10:54.379
Yep.

10:54.427 --> 10:56.304
Sophie...

10:56.347 --> 10:59.020
c- can I say how beautiful you look?

10:59.067 --> 11:01.342
- Thank you, Mark.
- Can...

11:01.387 --> 11:03.059
Can I kiss you, Sophie?

11:06.547 --> 11:08.538
'Oh, my God. Umm...

11:08.587 --> 11:10.896
'What about my abnormal knackers?

11:10.947 --> 11:14.178
'Ooh, this is nice. How weird are they?

11:14.227 --> 11:18.823
'What I really need is a good, long look
at another man's bollocks.

11:18.867 --> 11:22.257
'But that's so fraught
with potential problems. '

11:23.267 --> 11:25.223
Oh. That was nice.

11:25.267 --> 11:29.738
- Yeah, that was nice.
- 'Thank you, Ray! Thank you, Ray! '

11:31.427 --> 11:34.976
? Onward Christian soldiers

11:35.027 --> 11:37.780
? Marching as to war...?

11:38.987 --> 11:41.740
'It must have been taken
shortly before he died. '

11:41.787 --> 11:47.384
'God. You think you're in, then the
smiting, plagues and pestilence starts.

11:47.427 --> 11:49.258
'Shit, I can't believe it. '

11:49.987 --> 11:51.978
Hey, Jez! I've got news!

11:52.027 --> 11:54.905
- So have I.
- Sophie's coming away with me

11:54.947 --> 11:57.984
to a cottage with a bed for the weekend.

11:58.027 --> 11:59.665
Now, listen, mate,

11:59.707 --> 12:04.542
I need to ask you a straight-up,
man-to-man question about bollocks.

12:04.587 --> 12:08.899
The hospital called. What Ray died of,
Boden-Georgeson syndrome,

12:08.947 --> 12:12.098
- it's hereditary.
- What? Y-You're kidding.

12:12.147 --> 12:15.423
I might have it.
They want me to go in for tests.

12:15.467 --> 12:18.937
Tests? Jesus, mate. Fuck.

12:18.987 --> 12:21.547
- No, are you OK?
- Yeah.

12:22.627 --> 12:25.380
No. To be honest, I'm scared.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.859
- Look, don't be scared.
- I am scared.

12:30.707 --> 12:32.698
Don't be scared.

12:32.747 --> 12:34.658
I am scared.

12:35.267 --> 12:37.258
That's fine, that's fine.

12:37.307 --> 12:39.867
It's perfectly natural to be scared.

12:41.027 --> 12:44.463
'Doctor Runciman has seen this
a thousand times.

12:44.507 --> 12:48.819
'It's just two guys, one with his hand
on the other guy's balls. '

12:49.387 --> 12:51.378
Mark Corrigan?

12:52.707 --> 12:55.858
Dr Runciman's on call.
I'm the practice nurse.

12:55.907 --> 12:58.296
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

12:58.347 --> 13:00.019
'No. No, no, no, no, no. '

13:00.067 --> 13:02.627
- So how can I help?
- Oh, it was just...

13:03.467 --> 13:05.537
I think I should see the doctor.

13:05.587 --> 13:08.863
Not that I've got anything
against your... kind.

13:08.907 --> 13:12.263
If you tell me the problem,
maybe I can deal with it.

13:12.307 --> 13:16.505
Basically, it's -
not wishing to beat about the bush -

13:16.547 --> 13:18.902
it's a problem with...

13:18.947 --> 13:20.539
with my...

13:20.587 --> 13:22.100
Penis?

13:22.747 --> 13:24.544
Testisticles.

13:24.587 --> 13:28.899
- So if you'd feel happier, I...
- OK, trousers down, hop on the couch,

13:28.947 --> 13:31.063
let's have a look at the little fellows.

13:31.107 --> 13:35.225
'Oh, I hope I don't... No leaping
to attention, Captain Corrigan.

13:35.267 --> 13:38.179
'Anyone would say
she's an attractive woman.

13:38.227 --> 13:40.297
'She should have to wear a mask.

13:40.347 --> 13:42.417
'Reagan or Batman or...

13:42.467 --> 13:46.460
'Actually, she'd look pretty horny
as Batman. Jesus, no, don't! '

13:46.507 --> 13:49.305
So have you worked here long?

13:50.267 --> 13:53.498
- Blimey.
- Blimey? What's blimey?

13:53.547 --> 13:57.506
- Does that feel painful?
- No, no. That feels great.

13:57.547 --> 13:59.617
I mean, not great, just normal.

13:59.667 --> 14:02.227
'Oh, how much can a man take? '

14:02.267 --> 14:03.859
You've got a large hydrocele.

14:03.907 --> 14:09.027
It's a simple procedure. The scalpel just
slips in at the back of the scrotum.

14:09.067 --> 14:12.696
'That's cooled things off,
a regular bucket of water. '

14:12.747 --> 14:16.422
'Abandon self-cherishing,
love only others.

14:16.467 --> 14:18.298
'Yeah, well, Mr Dalai Lama,

14:18.347 --> 14:21.942
'you've got to be a suck-up
if you haven't got your own country.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.659
'OK, stay focused.

14:23.707 --> 14:28.701
'Don't have to do them all,
just till you find something to hold on to.

14:28.747 --> 14:32.103
'Islam. Not really
such a fashionable religion.

14:32.147 --> 14:34.741
'Hinduism? That's got a nice vibe.

14:34.787 --> 14:37.745
'Find out the Hindus and the Hindon'ts.

14:37.787 --> 14:41.541
'Good old Bible. Bit "dribble not
the ass's milk on Tuesday. "

14:41.587 --> 14:43.976
'And I know most of it from The Omen. '

14:44.027 --> 14:46.780
OK, Jez, mate. I think that's about it.

14:46.827 --> 14:49.500
Uh-huh. Well, have a good time, mate.

14:55.107 --> 14:57.098
- Is he OK?
- I don't know.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.377
He gets the test results on Monday.

14:59.427 --> 15:02.180
- What do you think?
- He seems a bit on edge.

15:02.227 --> 15:04.582
The thing is, he's not definitely dying.

15:04.627 --> 15:07.903
- He's not even definitely ill.
- You're probably right.

15:07.947 --> 15:11.576
- What about the carving on his arm?
- That's just Biro.

15:11.627 --> 15:15.222
Anyway, he seems to be over that now.
And the whinnying.

15:15.267 --> 15:20.182
Things are looking positive. He's
investigating the key to all spiritualities.

15:20.227 --> 15:23.742
'Try and read a poem,
listen to inspiring music,

15:23.787 --> 15:25.778
'look at a wonderful painting... '

15:25.827 --> 15:29.137
'Or I could finish
the last of that skunk,

15:29.187 --> 15:32.577
'sit on Big Suze's dildo
and wank myself dry.

15:32.627 --> 15:36.017
'I could go to that place Super Hans says
is a knocking shop.

15:36.067 --> 15:38.456
'Lf not, bang a tab and get a massage. '

15:38.507 --> 15:40.896
Er, Jez.

15:40.947 --> 15:43.586
Me and Soph,
we were just having a chat,

15:43.627 --> 15:47.939
and, well, what we were saying
is that what we both really want

15:47.987 --> 15:50.785
is for you to come along
on our weekend.

15:50.827 --> 15:54.536
Yeah? Oh, I kind of had plans.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.704
Oh, you can take
your religious texts with you.

15:57.747 --> 16:01.626
- 'Maybe he doesn't want to come. '
- No point, it's all bullshit.

16:01.667 --> 16:04.420
'God, he really wants me to come. '

16:04.467 --> 16:06.139
It'll be such a laugh.

16:06.187 --> 16:08.178
'Please say no, please say no. '

16:08.227 --> 16:12.106
Er, well, all right. I guess.
If you really want me to.

16:12.147 --> 16:14.820
'I didn't realise
he was this terrified of sex. '

16:16.187 --> 16:20.180
'If I can get the first one over
without major embarrassment.

16:20.227 --> 16:22.502
'First fuck is damage limitation.

16:22.547 --> 16:25.584
'In, out, as much pleasure
as I can give her,

16:25.627 --> 16:28.187
'apologise, and then we can move on.

16:29.067 --> 16:32.218
'Jesus, look at him. What a disaster. '

16:32.267 --> 16:34.462
Jeremy, it's your go, isn't it?

16:34.507 --> 16:37.385
Er, whatever.
I just want to rewind this bit.

16:37.427 --> 16:40.260
Do you have to?
We're trying to play a game.

16:40.307 --> 16:43.697
I gave you the choice -
Tom and Barbara being nice

16:43.747 --> 16:45.897
or Gloria and Mitzy being nasty.

16:45.947 --> 16:49.701
If you don't want your go,
I'll attack Irkutsk.

16:49.747 --> 16:55.219
Fine. Can't you get it into your closed-off
little mind that I don't give a flying fuck?

16:55.267 --> 16:57.098
You will when I take Asia.

16:57.147 --> 16:59.422
Bleaurgh, bleaurgh,
bleaurgh, bleaurgh, bleaurgh.

16:59.467 --> 17:03.062
Nothing means anything. It's all just shit!

17:03.107 --> 17:06.542
Games, snacks, fires, man, woman, love.

17:06.587 --> 17:11.615
We're all gonna end up in the cold,
deep ground, and that's all there is. OK?

17:12.987 --> 17:15.785
Well, fine. I'm off for a shower.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.818
Good night, Jeremy.

17:17.867 --> 17:22.179
- See you in the bed... room, Soph.
- Yeah, sure.

17:22.227 --> 17:25.424
'Oh, what I really want's a woman.

17:25.467 --> 17:29.142
'Oh, God, I'm never gonna have
a woman again in my life.

17:29.187 --> 17:33.624
'I never planted my seed.
My loins are like dried buckwheat.

17:33.667 --> 17:35.498
'It's not fair. '

17:35.547 --> 17:37.538
So Jeremy, I'm going to turn in.

17:37.587 --> 17:39.339
Hope you sleep OK.

17:40.347 --> 17:42.338
Er, thanks.

17:44.027 --> 17:46.905
Er, Sophie, could I have a quick word?

17:47.867 --> 17:51.576
- In private.
- Sure, I mean, this is private.

17:57.267 --> 17:59.701
Must be hell trying to cope with all this.

17:59.747 --> 18:01.738
Well, yeah.

18:02.867 --> 18:04.858
Bloody hell, what are you doing?

18:04.907 --> 18:07.785
Oh, go on.
This could be the last time I do it.

18:07.827 --> 18:09.818
Imagine how committed I'd be?

18:09.867 --> 18:12.700
- I'm here with Mark.
- Mark...

18:12.747 --> 18:15.739
doesn't love you.
He doesn't even like you.

18:15.787 --> 18:18.017
- What?
- He...

18:18.067 --> 18:21.264
He said he's only snogging you
for a joke.

18:21.307 --> 18:24.219
And he draws horrible, vicious
cartoons of you

18:24.267 --> 18:28.818
and wraps them up in sausage meat
and calls you a sausage muncher.

18:28.867 --> 18:32.143
You're drunk, Jeremy.
Try and get some sleep.

18:32.187 --> 18:34.576
Go on. I might be dead in a week.

18:35.307 --> 18:38.663
Jeremy, look, I'm flattered
but I'm here with Mark.

18:38.707 --> 18:41.062
- What about a threes-up?
- Jeremy, Mark's...

18:41.107 --> 18:43.826
All right, OK, I get the message.

18:44.907 --> 18:46.943
Sophie?

18:49.387 --> 18:52.185
Jez must've gone for a walk. Thank God.

18:52.227 --> 18:54.377
You think he'd be more grateful.

18:54.427 --> 18:58.181
He'll change his tune
when I'm in charge of the morphine.

18:58.227 --> 19:01.617
It's like that, is it?
That's how it's going to be?

19:01.667 --> 19:05.182
- Well, excuse me!
- Jez, I didn't... I didn't mean.

19:07.067 --> 19:09.422
'Oh, wow. Oh, yeah.

19:09.467 --> 19:12.584
'Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, she is so...

19:12.627 --> 19:15.425
'Where am I?
Put your tongue out and see.

19:15.467 --> 19:18.584
'Neck? Yeah, neck. Oh.

19:18.627 --> 19:22.586
'Whoo-hoo-ho-ho. Ha-ha!
You can do that again. Oh, yeah. '

19:22.627 --> 19:24.743
- Mark?
- Yeah?

19:24.787 --> 19:27.176
Are you going to take your pants off?

19:27.227 --> 19:29.218
Er, yeah.

19:29.267 --> 19:32.339
Yeah, I will. But, Sophie, before I do,

19:32.387 --> 19:34.776
I need to prepare you for something.

19:34.827 --> 19:37.546
I intend to have an operation

19:37.587 --> 19:41.785
but until I do, I don't want you to be
alarmed by the size of my...

19:41.827 --> 19:44.785
Mark, stop boasting
and get some johnnies.

19:45.747 --> 19:47.817
Shit, they're in the bathroom.

19:48.827 --> 19:52.422
- Stay there, don't go away.
- I'm not going anywhere.

19:52.467 --> 19:56.983
'Got to be quick. Don't want to
have to get her all worked up again.

19:57.027 --> 19:59.018
'Did she say johnnies plural?

19:59.067 --> 20:02.503
'Hope she doesn't think
I'm some sort of superman. '

20:04.147 --> 20:07.822
'Couldn't even be bothered to go to bed.
It's pathetic.

20:07.867 --> 20:10.779
'What's...? Oh, my God. He's...

20:10.827 --> 20:12.897
'No. Don't be dead, mate.

20:12.947 --> 20:15.939
'Shit, no. Oh, God, no. In front of...

20:15.987 --> 20:18.785
'Tenko. That was probably the last straw.

20:18.827 --> 20:22.979
'Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Don't be dead, mate!
Please don't be dead!

20:23.027 --> 20:25.905
'My cock's gone right down. Fuck. '

20:25.947 --> 20:29.337
Sophie! Soph!
Something awful has happened.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.617
What?

20:36.667 --> 20:39.784
He's opened his eyes.
Jez, we're right here, Jez.

20:39.827 --> 20:44.343
- What's going on?
- You're in safe hands now, Jez.

20:44.387 --> 20:47.299
Was he behaving strangely
before the overdose?

20:47.347 --> 20:49.736
No. No more than usual.

20:49.787 --> 20:54.065
Well, he did... I didn't tell you this.
He did make a pass at me.

20:54.107 --> 20:57.816
A pass? He... The bloody...!

20:57.867 --> 21:00.586
He's been under a lot of stress recently.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.936
How many pills did you take, Jeremy?

21:02.987 --> 21:06.263
It's important you remember
how many you took.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.423
Pills? Just the one.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.537
He's delirious, the bottle was empty.

21:10.587 --> 21:12.703
Yeah, it was the last one.

21:12.747 --> 21:16.786
I had a headache. Has anyone got
any Coke? My mouth's all...

21:16.827 --> 21:20.820
I invite you here
and you repay me by trying to...

21:20.867 --> 21:22.983
have it away with my girlfriend.

21:23.027 --> 21:27.100
- I don't think girlfriend's quite...
- I've been feeling very low.

21:27.147 --> 21:29.024
Oh, were you? Were you?

21:29.067 --> 21:31.137
Yeah. I was feeling desperate.

21:31.747 --> 21:35.217
I mean, that's why...
that's why I took the overdose.

21:35.267 --> 21:38.065
- What? But you...
- I couldn't admit it.

21:38.107 --> 21:40.416
I was ashamed. But I did it.

21:40.467 --> 21:44.255
The bottle was full,
I... I took the whole lot.

21:44.307 --> 21:48.664
OK, if you two step to one side,
I'm gonna do a stomach pump.

21:48.707 --> 21:51.426
What? Er, no... Actually...

21:51.467 --> 21:55.380
I admit it, I was joking.
I was lying just then, not before.

21:55.427 --> 21:58.499
I didn't take an overdose.
Put away the hardware.

21:58.547 --> 22:01.937
I was lying just then.
Don't pump me! Don't pump me!

22:07.347 --> 22:09.736
- What the fuck?
- Soph, it's only me.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.142
- I've got something for you.
- Don't do that.

22:12.187 --> 22:15.179
- No one was coming.
- That's not the point.

22:15.227 --> 22:18.617
- It's not?
- No. Mark, we need to have a talk.

22:19.347 --> 22:22.737
- A talk? Oh.
- Mark...

22:22.787 --> 22:26.097
a funeral, it's an emotional time,
lots of emotions.

22:26.147 --> 22:30.060
- Are you finishing with me?
- We weren't ever really...

22:30.107 --> 22:31.665
Right.

22:31.707 --> 22:34.585
Not that something might not,
some day...

22:34.627 --> 22:38.905
Everything was a bit "whoosh!" and
I'd rather it was "dum-de-dum-de-dum".

22:38.947 --> 22:42.462
OK, well, that's just... I guess...

22:42.507 --> 22:44.657
you know...

22:44.707 --> 22:46.937
Did you want to give me something?

22:46.987 --> 22:49.296
Er, no, it's...

22:51.507 --> 22:53.657
it's your pants.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.459
Oh.

22:55.507 --> 22:57.623
I found them in my suitcase

22:57.667 --> 22:59.658
and I thought you...

23:00.947 --> 23:02.938
Anyway, er...

23:02.987 --> 23:04.864
here you go.

23:06.827 --> 23:08.863
Er, well, thanks.

23:08.907 --> 23:10.579
Not a problem.

23:11.507 --> 23:13.498
OK, well, I'll see you.

23:13.547 --> 23:16.107
See you... not around but here.

23:16.147 --> 23:19.139
OK, g... great. See you.

23:37.907 --> 23:40.865
So I, er... I got the test results.

23:43.147 --> 23:45.138
It's positive.

23:45.187 --> 23:47.257
Oh dear.

23:47.307 --> 23:50.105
- Oh, Jez.
- Are you OK?

23:51.907 --> 23:54.421
It's all broken. It's knackered.

23:55.227 --> 23:57.218
He dumped me.

23:58.707 --> 24:00.504
Daddy's gone again.

24:02.427 --> 24:05.305
Why does it happen?

24:05.347 --> 24:09.340
There are all these people
singing and dancing but never me.

24:09.387 --> 24:12.379
I'm sorry, I'll shut up.

24:12.427 --> 24:15.066
My problems are nothing compared to...
