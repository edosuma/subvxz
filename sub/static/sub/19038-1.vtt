01:49.359 --> 01:50.350
Mum!

02:07.919 --> 02:09.380
<i>How does this story begin?</i>

02:13.467 --> 02:16.340
<i>It begins like so many stories.</i>

02:19.181 --> 02:20.640
<i>With a boy.</i>

02:21.475 --> 02:24.010
<i>Too old to be a kid.</i>

02:26.146 --> 02:28.850
<i>Too young to be a man.</i>

02:34.404 --> 02:36.396
<i>And a nightmare.</i>

05:34.584 --> 05:36.746
It's got two fundamental constants.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.209
E, the base of the natural
logarithm system,

05:40.423 --> 05:44.008
it's a number, it's a number
that emerges from asking:

05:44.177 --> 05:47.511
What is the mathematical function or thing

05:47.681 --> 05:51.891
which describes things
where the rate at which they change...

05:56.106 --> 05:58.063
Now, if you do that mathematically,

05:58.733 --> 06:01.567
it will give you
this fundamental constant.

06:05.657 --> 06:06.647
Conor?

06:08.577 --> 06:09.943
Are you all right, Conor?

06:10.829 --> 06:11.819
You look tired.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.405
Are you getting enough rest?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.663
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:17.836 --> 06:20.453
'Cause if you ever wanted to talk...

06:20.630 --> 06:21.791
I'm fine.

06:22.757 --> 06:23.747
Okay.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.678
Everyone, eyes front.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.890
Pi is the ratio of the circumference,
and when you put it...

06:34.144 --> 06:36.261
Careful there, O'Malley. You might fall.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.845
Are you drunk or something?

06:38.690 --> 06:40.932
He'll have to get his slaphead mother
to kiss it for him.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.571
You're always off
in your own little dream world.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.071
What's there so interesting?

06:54.956 --> 06:56.037
Get off!

06:59.544 --> 07:01.410
You've been a good boy.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.754
Remember, O'Malley,

07:04.215 --> 07:05.956
good boys don't talk.

07:32.827 --> 07:33.943
Hey, Con!

07:34.329 --> 07:35.661
Hey, Mum.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.291
What is that?

07:40.502 --> 07:41.959
It's a surprise.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.665
So, this is a VCR?

07:44.839 --> 07:46.956
This is much better than a VCR.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.671
It's your grandpa's old film projector.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.006
There we go.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.512
- I wish you could have known him.
- Who?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.261
Grandpa.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.223
Even Grandma softened up around him.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.013
Yeah, right.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.306
Here we go.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.331
What a bunch of assholes.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.835
Why are they trying to kill King Kong?

08:26.214 --> 08:29.002
People don't like
what they don't understand.

08:31.553 --> 08:32.919
They get scared.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.553
King Kong could just smash them all.

08:38.308 --> 08:40.847
Break them into a million pieces.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.350
Yeah.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.341
Conor.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.432
Mum?

14:10.350 --> 14:13.934
I have come to get you, Conor O'Malley.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.979
Why don't you run, Conor O'Malley?

14:25.156 --> 14:27.364
Why don't you run for your mother?

14:30.703 --> 14:33.116
You leave her alone!
I'm not afraid of you!

14:49.931 --> 14:53.424
I will visit you again
on further nights, Conor O'Malley.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.934
And I will shake your walls
until you wake.

14:56.104 --> 14:59.643
And then, I will tell you three stories.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.392
You're going to tell me stories?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.106
I am.

15:06.280 --> 15:10.816
I will tell you three stories,
and when I have finished my stories,

15:11.035 --> 15:13.322
you will tell me a fourth.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.032
I don't know anything about stories!

15:15.206 --> 15:18.040
You will tell me a fourth,
and it will be the truth.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.825
What are you talking about?

15:20.044 --> 15:23.754
This truth that you hide.
The truth you dream.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.173
- You will tell me your nightmare.
- No.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.299
Yes. That will be your truth.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.628
And if I don't?

15:58.541 --> 16:01.375
Con, I was asleep.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.713
You should be in your own bed, Con.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.212
Just five minutes.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.677
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

16:17.768 --> 16:21.478
- Come on, Con.
- Just five minutes. I promise.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.185
Five minutes.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.196
Night, night.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.823
I respect that. But the last thing
your father would want

17:56.993 --> 17:59.485
would be for him
to be taken off to America

17:59.662 --> 18:02.370
to live with some strange woman
and her strange child.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.202
We have to discuss this now.

18:04.792 --> 18:05.999
Hey, Con!

18:06.210 --> 18:07.621
There's the little man.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.286
Where did you say you got these?

18:09.463 --> 18:11.750
From a very nice old people's home.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.712
They're clearing it out to make flats,
and I'll be the agent.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.169
Your mother needs a cup of tea.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.929
Green, no sugar. I take mine black.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.969
What do you think, Con?

18:22.351 --> 18:23.262
He loves it.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.302
- Go on.
- Okay.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.514
Go on, try something else.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.020
Alright.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.029
You can't just drift, Lizzy.
You have to make some decisions.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.202
I am making all the decisions I can,

18:42.371 --> 18:44.829
and I will decide when I speak to Conor.

18:49.003 --> 18:52.622
Go and help Conor with the tea
or I'll literally go insane.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.508
You and I need to have a talk.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.172
I'm making tea.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.969
- Conor!
- I said, I'm making...

19:04.143 --> 19:05.725
We have to...

19:06.604 --> 19:08.846
I'm not the enemy.
I'm here to help your mother.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.059
I know why you're here.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.064
I'm here because 12-year-old boys

19:12.234 --> 19:15.272
shouldn't be wiping down counters
without being asked to first.

19:15.446 --> 19:16.402
You wanna do it?

19:16.572 --> 19:18.279
Less of your cheek.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.650
She's always sick after the treatments.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.069
She'll be better tomorrow.
And then you can go home.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.454
She'll seem better tomorrow.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.707
She needs to talk about this with you.

19:28.876 --> 19:29.957
Talk to me about what?

19:32.713 --> 19:36.172
- About you coming to live with me.
- I'm never coming to live...

19:36.342 --> 19:39.335
- Listen to me. If your mother...
- There's no if!

19:39.512 --> 19:42.721
She'll be better and then you can go.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.931
Lizzy?

19:46.310 --> 19:47.551
Lizzy!

19:47.937 --> 19:48.802
Oh, my God!

19:48.979 --> 19:51.062
Hold on, hold on.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.393
Where's the medicine?

19:52.566 --> 19:53.556
Conor!

19:54.276 --> 19:55.266
Conor!

19:55.861 --> 19:58.319
I'm here, darling. Deep breath.

19:58.489 --> 20:01.027
Conor, please!
Please give me the medicine.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.441
Hurry, hurry.

20:04.578 --> 20:05.694
It's coming.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.536
It's coming.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.369
Here we go.

20:15.256 --> 20:16.667
Deep breath.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.043
Deep breath.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.048
Deep breath.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.883
Deep breath.

20:27.476 --> 20:28.967
It's okay.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.571
Just don't touch anything.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.992
Trust me,
I'll be doing my very best not to.

20:55.296 --> 20:58.289
Our conversation isn't over, young man.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.669
Oh, yes, it is.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.159
Mum!

22:41.652 --> 22:43.769
What took you so long?

22:44.154 --> 22:46.612
It is time for me
to tell you the first tale.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.239
I don't need a tale.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.407
I need a bus ticket for my grandma.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.570
It is time for me to tell you the...

22:52.746 --> 22:55.830
Where do you think you're going?
I will be listened to!

22:56.000 --> 22:57.707
I am as old as this land and...

22:57.877 --> 22:59.493
What do you know about anything?

22:59.670 --> 23:02.913
I know everything about you,
Conor O'Malley.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.422
No, you don't!

23:04.592 --> 23:07.130
If you did, you'd know
I don't have time to listen

23:07.303 --> 23:10.717
to stupid stories from a stupid tree
that is just a dream.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.301
A dream?

23:12.474 --> 23:14.932
What is a dream, Conor O'Malley?

23:15.102 --> 23:18.470
And who is to say that it is not
everything else that is a dream?

23:19.982 --> 23:21.473
Never mind.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.893
I came to see you because I thought...

23:25.070 --> 23:27.904
You thought I might have come
to topple your enemies.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.655
Slay your dragons.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.487
Or at least help me with my grandmother.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.902
But all you want to do is tell me stories.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.571
Stories of how I toppled my enemies.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.787
Stories of how I slew dragons.

23:40.461 --> 23:43.204
Let me tell you a tale
of when I came walking.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.623
Let me tell you of the end
of a wicked queen

23:46.800 --> 23:50.919
and how I made sure
she was never seen again.

23:56.769 --> 23:57.759
Go on, then.

23:58.479 --> 23:59.845
Good.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.011
<i>What do you see?</i>

24:33.180 --> 24:35.422
<i>Nothing. There are leaves in the way.</i>

24:35.599 --> 24:37.966
<i>Use your imagination, Conor O'Malley.</i>

24:39.520 --> 24:41.056
<i>What do you see?</i>

24:44.775 --> 24:46.812
- <i>I see a spark.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

24:46.986 --> 24:48.147
<i>And?</i>

24:48.320 --> 24:50.107
<i>No, it's water.</i>

24:50.322 --> 24:51.483
<i>It's watercolor.</i>

24:51.657 --> 24:53.193
<i>Keep looking.</i>

24:54.868 --> 24:55.779
<i>Wow!</i>

24:55.953 --> 24:57.910
<i>Wow, indeed.</i>

24:58.080 --> 25:00.288
<i>Long ago, before this was a town,</i>

25:00.457 --> 25:04.542
<i>with roads and trains
and cars, this was a kingdom.</i>

25:04.712 --> 25:07.329
<i>Here? We don't even have a Tesco.</i>

25:07.965 --> 25:12.835
<i>It was a prosperous kingdom with a wise
king who had won peace for his people,</i>

25:13.012 --> 25:15.846
<i>but peace had come at a price.</i>

25:17.016 --> 25:21.977
<i>The king had lost all three
of his sons in battle to giants.</i>

25:24.148 --> 25:25.684
<i>To dragons.</i>

25:27.359 --> 25:30.022
<i>To armies of men led by great wizards.</i>

25:30.195 --> 25:32.107
<i>This is all sounding pretty fairytale-ish.</i>

25:32.281 --> 25:36.742
<i>You wouldn't say that if you heard
the screams of a man killed by a spear.</i>

25:41.749 --> 25:45.459
<i>The queen was unable to bear
the loss of all their three sons,</i>

25:48.213 --> 25:50.205
<i>leaving the king alone in despair</i>

25:50.382 --> 25:53.796
<i>with the company
of his only remaining heir,</i>

25:53.969 --> 25:56.177
<i>his orphaned grandson.</i>

26:02.311 --> 26:04.428
<i>The child was raised as a prince,</i>

26:04.646 --> 26:08.606
<i>winning the love of the kingdom
with his gallantry and good heart.</i>

26:14.990 --> 26:17.448
<i>His people loved him.</i>

26:18.118 --> 26:20.110
Our future king!

26:24.166 --> 26:28.251
<i>He was nearly a man
when his grandfather took a new wife.</i>

26:33.217 --> 26:38.011
<i>The king felt ill and rumour began
to spread that she was an evil witch,</i>

26:38.180 --> 26:41.139
<i>that she was bent on taking
the throne for herself</i>

26:41.308 --> 26:43.516
<i>by poisoning the king.</i>

26:47.314 --> 26:51.183
<i>A few weeks later, the king died.</i>

26:56.907 --> 27:00.150
<i>The prince was too young
to take the king's place,</i>

27:00.327 --> 27:05.288
<i>so, by law, the queen would rule
for another year.</i>

27:10.420 --> 27:12.912
<i>The future was uncertain.</i>

27:24.893 --> 27:28.557
<i>The prince, meanwhile,
had given away his heart.</i>

27:29.398 --> 27:31.481
<i>She was beautiful and smart,</i>

27:31.692 --> 27:36.153
<i>and though only a farmer's daughter,
the kingdom smiled on the match.</i>

27:40.617 --> 27:44.486
<i>The queen, however,
she was rather enjoying being queen.</i>

27:44.955 --> 27:49.040
<i>And what better way to remain so
than to marry the prince herself?</i>

27:49.209 --> 27:51.166
<i>What? That's disgusting!</i>

27:51.336 --> 27:53.953
- <i>She was his grandmother!</i>
- <i>Step-grandmother.</i>

27:54.131 --> 27:57.715
<i>And still a young, beautiful
woman herself, don't forget.</i>

27:57.968 --> 28:01.382
<i>The prince, however,
didn't like the idea either.</i>

28:05.809 --> 28:10.019
<i>He took the farmer's daughter
and they rode away into the night.</i>

28:12.566 --> 28:16.355
<i>They stopped to rest
under the branches of a yew tree.</i>

28:16.528 --> 28:17.735
<i>That's you!</i>

28:19.072 --> 28:21.530
<i>The next morning, the prince awoke.</i>

28:22.159 --> 28:25.197
<i>'Arise, my beloved', he said.</i>

28:25.370 --> 28:28.488
<i>But the farmer's daughter did not stir,</i>

28:31.001 --> 28:33.539
<i>which was when the prince
noticed the blood.</i>

28:33.754 --> 28:34.585
<i>Blood?</i>

28:34.755 --> 28:37.213
<i>Someone had killed his beloved
in the night.</i>

28:37.382 --> 28:38.372
<i>What?</i>

28:39.801 --> 28:41.542
<i>'The queen!', he cried.</i>

28:41.762 --> 28:44.379
<i>'The queen has murdered my bride!'</i>

28:45.515 --> 28:49.805
<i>The villagers, full of fury
and vengeance, rose up at the crime.</i>

28:50.312 --> 28:53.430
<i>It was then that I came walking.</i>

29:17.047 --> 29:20.165
<i>The queen was never seen again.</i>

29:23.595 --> 29:25.678
Good! She deserved it!

29:26.974 --> 29:29.887
Now, I don't suppose
you can help me with my grandma.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.926
The story is not yet finished.

29:33.063 --> 29:36.022
I took the queen
and carried her far enough away

29:36.191 --> 29:39.400
so the town's people would never find her.

29:39.569 --> 29:43.438
To a village by the sea,
where she began a new life.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.823
But she killed the farmer's daughter!

29:46.034 --> 29:48.367
How can you save a murderer?

29:49.037 --> 29:50.198
You really are a monster.

29:50.372 --> 29:53.035
I never said
she killed the farmer's daughter.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.542
I only said
that the prince said it was so.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.546
The prince never fell asleep that night,

30:01.133 --> 30:05.127
<i>but waited for the farmer's daughter
to be lost in her dreams,</i>

30:05.304 --> 30:08.217
<i>and then began his real plan.</i>

30:09.433 --> 30:10.514
<i>What?</i>

30:11.685 --> 30:17.056
<i>He knew her death would start a fire
that would consume the queen entire.</i>

30:21.903 --> 30:23.940
That's a terrible story! And a cheat!

30:24.364 --> 30:26.105
It's a true story.

30:26.283 --> 30:29.151
Many things that are true
feel like a cheat.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.411
Kingdoms get the princes they deserve.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.993
Farmers' daughters die for no reason.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.079
And sometimes witches merit saving.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.962
Quite often, actually. You'd be surprised.

30:43.050 --> 30:45.713
So, the good prince was a murderer

30:45.927 --> 30:47.964
and the evil queen
wasn't a witch after all?

30:48.138 --> 30:51.631
No, the queen most certainly was a witch

30:52.184 --> 30:55.427
and could well have been
on her way to great evil.

30:55.604 --> 30:56.720
Who can say?

30:56.938 --> 30:58.554
Then why'd you save her then?

30:58.732 --> 31:02.817
Because what she was not, was a murderer.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.771
<i>She hadn't poisoned the king.</i>

31:07.115 --> 31:09.653
<i>He had merely grown old.</i>

31:11.328 --> 31:14.036
- <i>Did the prince ever get caught?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

31:14.206 --> 31:16.448
<i>He became a much beloved king</i>

31:16.625 --> 31:20.369
<i>who ruled happily
until the end of his long days.</i>

31:20.545 --> 31:21.911
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

31:23.215 --> 31:24.296
I don't get it.

31:24.716 --> 31:25.957
Who's the good guy here?

31:26.134 --> 31:28.842
There is not always a good guy,
Conor O'Malley.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.171
Nor is there always a bad one.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.465
Most people are somewhere in between.

31:35.268 --> 31:38.432
So how is all this
meant to save me from Grandma?

31:39.940 --> 31:43.399
It is not her you need saving from.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.413
There are always two sides to a story.

32:05.590 --> 32:10.175
How many of you know the saying:
'Sticks and stones may break your bones,

32:10.345 --> 32:13.213
but words can never hurt you'?

32:13.390 --> 32:16.883
Next time, when someone
says something to you...

32:41.835 --> 32:43.792
Good, you're home.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.875
Your mum's upstairs.
She wants to talk to you.

32:47.090 --> 32:47.921
What?

32:48.091 --> 32:50.708
Your father's flying in on Sunday.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.752
Dad's coming? From America?

32:54.055 --> 32:56.468
Go on. She is waiting.

32:57.601 --> 32:58.887
And pack a bag.

32:59.102 --> 33:01.719
You're coming to stay with me
for a few days.

33:02.689 --> 33:03.805
Go on!

33:17.746 --> 33:19.078
That tree is amazing.

33:21.291 --> 33:23.954
It's been here for thousands of years.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.787
What do you think?

33:28.840 --> 33:31.833
I think Grandma is trying
to turn me into Tina Turner.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.175
She must be a fan.

33:39.643 --> 33:41.680
Why am I going to stay with Grandma?

33:45.482 --> 33:47.474
Are you going back to hospital?

33:49.361 --> 33:50.943
Come here, Con.

33:56.117 --> 33:59.610
This latest treatment's not doing
what it's supposed to.

34:01.164 --> 34:04.783
So they're going to adjust it,
try something else.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.416
- That's all?
- That's all.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.464
Are you sure?

34:15.344 --> 34:16.585
I'm sure.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.880
Because...

34:20.725 --> 34:22.808
You could tell me, you know?

34:42.163 --> 34:43.244
There.

34:44.456 --> 34:46.574
Everything will be fine, Conor.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.789
You'll see.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.943
...and bang, right into his side.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.296
Where are you going?

35:40.639 --> 35:43.382
- Don't touch him.
- With such a punchable face?

35:43.558 --> 35:44.924
I said don't touch him.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.103
O'Malley and I have an understanding.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.182
I am the only one who touches him.

35:53.735 --> 35:54.896
Isn't that right?

35:56.071 --> 35:57.437
Now tell me,

35:58.865 --> 36:03.200
why is it every time that I turn around,
you're there looking at me?

36:03.745 --> 36:06.738
Getting a bit odd, don't you think?

36:10.502 --> 36:11.743
Sorry, that was a bit harsh.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.287
Life's not really going
your way today, is it?

36:34.275 --> 36:35.982
I have a house to show.

36:36.152 --> 36:39.520
I'm trusting you here alone
until your father shows up.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.030
I'm not five years old.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.117
This is the correct time.

36:45.328 --> 36:46.910
Not the one on your phone,

36:47.080 --> 36:50.118
or on the computer, not even on the news.

36:50.417 --> 36:53.660
It was my mother's,
your great-grandmother's.

36:53.837 --> 36:56.830
Perfect time keeping
for over a hundred years.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.457
Conor, pick up your rucksack!

37:01.302 --> 37:05.262
I don't want your father to think
I'm keeping you in a pigsty.

37:05.432 --> 37:06.673
Not much chance of that.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.763
Now, when you go to the hospital,

37:10.186 --> 37:13.179
your father may not notice
how tired your mum is getting.

37:13.398 --> 37:16.436
So we have to make sure
that he doesn't overstay his welcome.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.610
Not that that's
historically been a problem.

37:19.779 --> 37:22.897
No eggs. You've already
had eggs twice this week.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.988
If you get hungry, there's spinach
in the fridge which you can steam.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.494
Yes, sure.

37:29.456 --> 37:31.072
Don't touch anything.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.751
I'll do my very best not to.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.075
Get in!

39:45.675 --> 39:46.665
Dad.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.289
How you doing? You look tired.

40:27.508 --> 40:28.749
I'm fine.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.627
Mum's on this new medicine.
It'll make her better.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.721
She goes into hospital
once every two weeks

40:34.891 --> 40:39.727
and they pump the medicine
into her bloodstream.

40:40.229 --> 40:43.813
She is sick for the next few days,
but she is better again.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.900
Your sister's doing better.

40:54.077 --> 40:55.488
Half-sister.

40:56.245 --> 40:57.326
Yeah.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.371
I'd still love you to meet her.

41:01.167 --> 41:04.001
I've been talking with your grandma
about bringing you out to LA.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.620
You want me to come to LA?

41:06.798 --> 41:08.130
Yeah, absolutely!

41:08.299 --> 41:10.586
- You would you like that, wouldn't you?
- Yeah.

41:10.760 --> 41:14.504
We were thinking over Christmas.
You can be back here in time for school.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.381
So you mean just for a visit, then?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.557
Yeah, but it would be great.

41:20.228 --> 41:22.515
I don't want to live with Grandma.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.931
It's an old lady's house,
with old lady's things.

41:25.108 --> 41:27.225
You can't touch anything or sit anywhere.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.268
You can't leave a mess for two seconds.

41:29.445 --> 41:30.526
Conor...

41:30.697 --> 41:33.531
I want to have my own room
in my own house and my own things.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.783
You wouldn't have that in America.
There's barely enough room for us.

41:35.952 --> 41:37.784
- I don't care!
- Conor, listen.

41:37.954 --> 41:40.196
- She is so strict.
- Your family, your life, your friends...

41:40.373 --> 41:44.162
- Her house is like a museum!
- All of it is here.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.078
- It'd be unfair to take you out of it.
- Unfair to who?

41:47.255 --> 41:48.336
Conor.

41:59.892 --> 42:02.225
Doesn't look like your grandma's home yet.

42:03.229 --> 42:06.813
She sometimes goes back
to the hospital after I go to bed.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.270
The nurses let her sleep in a chair.

42:09.777 --> 42:13.270
Just because she doesn't like me,
doesn't make her a bad person.

42:13.448 --> 42:16.191
She says you're all start and no finish.

42:17.994 --> 42:20.828
Well, she is entitled to her own opinion.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.622
How long are you here for?

42:24.792 --> 42:26.283
As long as I can be.

42:27.503 --> 42:29.210
What does that mean?

42:29.922 --> 42:33.632
We don't have a lot of money.
And Americans don't get a lot of holidays.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.669
- You're not American.
- But I live there now.

42:38.473 --> 42:40.180
I'll come back whenever I need to.

42:40.349 --> 42:41.931
And you are gonna come to LA
for Christmas.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.434
In your cramped house,
where there's no room for me.

42:44.645 --> 42:45.635
Conor!

42:48.733 --> 42:50.349
Why did you come?

42:56.824 --> 42:58.440
Conor, wait!

43:02.955 --> 43:04.992
Conor, I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

43:05.917 --> 43:07.749
There's still loads of time!

44:56.152 --> 45:00.066
As destruction goes,
that was remarkably pitiful.

45:01.032 --> 45:03.570
Now, I have come to tell you
the second tale.

45:03.743 --> 45:05.154
Is this as bad as the last one?

45:06.454 --> 45:10.164
It ends with proper destruction,
if that's what you mean.

45:10.333 --> 45:12.791
It's about a man
who thought only of himself,

45:12.960 --> 45:15.293
who wasn't as generous
as he should have been.

45:15.463 --> 45:18.797
A man who gets punished very badly indeed.

45:19.133 --> 45:22.001
Stories aren't real, though.
They don't help anything.

45:22.178 --> 45:25.342
Stories are wild creatures,
Conor O'Malley.

45:25.514 --> 45:28.678
When you let them loose, who knows
what havoc they might wreak?

45:28.851 --> 45:29.841
Oh, yes!

45:32.688 --> 45:33.678
Okay.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.056
Go on, then.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.692
Good.

46:16.899 --> 46:21.143
<i>150 years ago, the future came.</i>

46:22.446 --> 46:25.405
<i>Factories grew in the landscape
like weeds.</i>

46:26.826 --> 46:28.909
<i>Trees fell, rivers blackened</i>

46:29.078 --> 46:32.071
<i>and the sky choked on smoke and ash.</i>

46:34.250 --> 46:37.789
<i>But there was still green
if you knew where to look.</i>

46:38.796 --> 46:43.632
<i>On the edge of this town lived
a stubborn man who refused to change.</i>

46:47.054 --> 46:49.762
<i>He dealt in the old ways of medicine,</i>

46:49.932 --> 46:54.347
<i>herbs and barks and concoctions
brewed from berries and leaves.</i>

46:54.520 --> 46:57.684
<i>Villagers only ever called him
the apothecary.</i>

46:57.857 --> 46:58.597
<i>The what?</i>

46:58.774 --> 47:02.267
<i>The apothecary.
An old fashion name for pharmacist.</i>

47:03.237 --> 47:04.899
<i>Why didn't you just say?</i>

47:10.119 --> 47:12.702
<i>There was also a young parson
in this village,</i>

47:12.872 --> 47:15.034
<i>an enlightened man and a kind one</i>

47:15.207 --> 47:18.951
<i>who just wanted the very best
for his congregation.</i>

47:19.837 --> 47:23.171
<i>He preached against the apothecary's
use of the old ways,</i>

47:23.341 --> 47:25.833
<i>and the apothecary's foul temper and greed</i>

47:26.010 --> 47:30.345
<i>made certain some of these sermons
fell on eager ears.</i>

47:36.020 --> 47:38.933
<i>Much as he tried
to keep on helping the community,</i>

47:39.106 --> 47:44.017
<i>his business sank,
which only made him grow bitter.</i>

47:47.656 --> 47:51.149
<i>On the parsonage grounds
there also lived a yew tree.</i>

47:52.703 --> 47:54.035
<i>That's the hill where you live.</i>

47:54.205 --> 47:57.414
<i>The yew tree is the most important
of all the healing trees.</i>

47:57.583 --> 47:59.700
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Its berries, its bark,</i>

47:59.877 --> 48:02.915
<i>they thrum and burn and twist with life.</i>

48:03.089 --> 48:05.832
<i>It can cure almost any ailment.</i>

48:06.008 --> 48:07.215
<i>Really? Anything?</i>

48:07.385 --> 48:11.595
<i>Anything that can be cured,
if mixed by the right apothecary.</i>

48:20.606 --> 48:23.269
<i>The apothecary wanted
the yew tree very badly.</i>

48:23.442 --> 48:27.186
<i>But in order to harvest these things,
he would have to cut it down.</i>

48:27.363 --> 48:30.731
<i>And this, the parson would not allow.</i>

48:37.748 --> 48:41.082
<i>The parson had two daughters
who were the light of his life.</i>

48:41.252 --> 48:43.209
<i>He was a caring, loving father</i>

48:43.379 --> 48:45.712
<i>who'd have done anything for their sake.</i>

48:45.881 --> 48:50.467
<i>But one day, both little girls
were struck by a terrible sickness,</i>

48:51.470 --> 48:53.962
<i>and nothing the parson did helped.</i>

48:54.140 --> 48:58.635
<i>No cure from the more modern doctors,
no prayer, nothing.</i>

49:06.861 --> 49:10.821
<i>There was no choice
but to approach the apothecary.</i>

49:13.075 --> 49:16.409
<i>'Will you not help my daughters?',
the parson begged.</i>

49:16.579 --> 49:19.822
<i>'Will you not save two innocent girls?'</i>

49:20.791 --> 49:23.909
<i>'Why should I?', said the apothecary.</i>

49:24.086 --> 49:26.999
<i>'You have driven away my business
with your preachings</i>

49:27.173 --> 49:31.463
<i>and you have refused me the yew tree,
my best source of healing.'</i>

49:32.303 --> 49:34.966
<i>'You may have the yew tree',
said the parson.</i>

49:35.139 --> 49:37.131
<i>'I will preach sermons in your favor.'</i>

49:37.308 --> 49:40.801
<i>'I will do anything if you
would only save my daughters.'</i>

49:41.812 --> 49:45.977
<i>'You would give up everything
you believed in?', said the apothecary.</i>

49:46.150 --> 49:49.484
<i>'If it would save them,
I would give up everything.'</i>

49:50.821 --> 49:54.360
<i>'Then there is nothing
I can do to help you.'</i>

50:17.473 --> 50:20.807
The very next day,
both of the parson's daughters died.

50:20.976 --> 50:22.057
What?

50:22.228 --> 50:25.096
That night, I came walking.

50:25.397 --> 50:28.561
Good! He deserves
all the punishment he gets!

50:28.817 --> 50:30.103
Indeed.

50:30.277 --> 50:33.236
It was shortly after midnight
that I tore the parson's home

50:33.405 --> 50:34.896
from its very foundations.

50:35.115 --> 50:37.778
The parson? What are you talking about?

50:37.952 --> 50:39.693
The apothecary's the evil one.

50:39.870 --> 50:43.614
He was greedy and rude,
but he was still a healer.

50:43.999 --> 50:46.116
The parson? What was he?

50:48.921 --> 50:51.208
A man of faith without faith.

50:59.348 --> 51:00.930
Belief is half of all healing.

51:01.141 --> 51:04.760
Belief in the cure,
belief in the future that awaits.

51:05.479 --> 51:07.516
Your belief is valuable,

51:07.690 --> 51:10.649
so you must be careful where you put it,

51:10.818 --> 51:12.901
and in whom.

51:15.155 --> 51:17.863
Tell me, Conor O'Malley.
What shall I destroy next?

51:18.033 --> 51:18.773
What?

51:18.951 --> 51:21.113
It is most satisfying, I can assure you.

51:21.287 --> 51:24.496
Come on! Tell me! What should I destroy?

51:26.750 --> 51:28.412
Snap the chimney?

51:28.586 --> 51:29.918
The chimney!

51:31.547 --> 51:32.628
Next!

51:33.465 --> 51:34.546
Throw away their beds!

51:39.972 --> 51:41.213
Smash the furniture!

51:50.649 --> 51:51.639
Break the windows!

51:52.318 --> 51:53.684
Windows.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.274
Break them yourself.

52:00.326 --> 52:01.362
C'mon!

52:12.755 --> 52:14.712
Harder, Conor O'Malley! Come on!

52:14.882 --> 52:15.838
Harder!

52:16.008 --> 52:17.590
That's it, that's it!

52:18.427 --> 52:19.417
Yes!

52:22.389 --> 52:23.721
Feels good, doesn't it?

52:23.891 --> 52:25.052
Yes!

54:14.710 --> 54:15.871
Grandma.

54:16.670 --> 54:17.786
Grandma.

54:18.922 --> 54:19.912
Grandma.

54:21.759 --> 54:23.466
Grandma, please...

55:02.800 --> 55:04.041
Grandma.

56:05.153 --> 56:06.940
How do you like them sunny side up?

56:07.781 --> 56:09.147
What are you doing here?

56:09.616 --> 56:11.073
What do you think?

56:15.163 --> 56:17.325
Grandma called very early this morning.

56:20.043 --> 56:22.035
She's gone to the hospital
to see your mum.

56:22.212 --> 56:24.295
She has had a bad turn.

56:27.217 --> 56:28.549
I need to see her.

56:28.719 --> 56:30.335
We'll see what happens today

56:30.554 --> 56:33.797
and maybe you can visit
for a little while this afternoon.

56:39.605 --> 56:41.597
I can see how upset you are.

56:44.610 --> 56:46.442
I didn't mean to.

56:46.653 --> 56:49.691
- I don't know what happened.
- Worse things happen at sea.

56:50.532 --> 56:51.739
What does that mean?

56:52.868 --> 56:54.200
Aren't you going to punish me?

56:54.369 --> 56:56.531
What could possibly be the point in that?

57:04.671 --> 57:08.005
I gotta say, champ, this is
really just amazingly thorough.

57:15.390 --> 57:16.380
Buried treasure!

57:17.726 --> 57:19.308
These must be those...

57:19.811 --> 57:22.599
The home movies your mum used
to send to me when I moved away.

57:22.773 --> 57:23.763
Why did you move away?

57:28.487 --> 57:29.773
We were young.

57:30.238 --> 57:32.230
Too young. We had big dreams, and...

57:32.699 --> 57:33.735
What kind of dreams?

57:33.909 --> 57:36.617
Well, your mum wanted to go
to Art college.

57:39.915 --> 57:41.326
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:41.541 --> 57:44.124
- She didn't go, but she wanted to.
- What happened?

57:47.047 --> 57:49.664
- Because Mum got pregnant with me.
- Hey.

57:49.841 --> 57:53.300
Mum never regretted having you.
You were only ever good news.

57:53.637 --> 57:54.798
And I know that for a fact,

57:54.972 --> 57:57.180
because the one thing
she regretted was marrying me.

57:57.349 --> 57:59.011
Why did she marry you, then?

57:59.685 --> 58:01.142
Because I'm handsome.

58:06.608 --> 58:09.225
Your mum was amazing, and she still is.

58:09.403 --> 58:10.894
And we were in love.

58:11.905 --> 58:14.898
I mean, I still love her.
But, you see, the...

58:18.120 --> 58:19.907
Love isn't enough.

58:20.122 --> 58:21.704
It doesn't carry you through.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.367
So, you didn't get happily ever after.

58:25.585 --> 58:28.293
No, but that's life, you know?

58:29.631 --> 58:31.543
Most of us just get messily ever after.

58:33.260 --> 58:34.341
That's alright.

58:39.182 --> 58:41.890
But I'm happy you turned out like her.

59:32.027 --> 59:33.484
Mrs Chandler.

59:38.658 --> 59:41.401
Education is really important!

59:41.620 --> 59:43.532
You're telling me what to do.
I'm pulled in every direction.

59:43.747 --> 59:46.080
Are you going
to take him out of school then?

59:52.631 --> 59:53.712
Thank you.

59:57.552 --> 59:59.464
I'm gonna go and find something to eat.
You want anything, kid?

59:59.679 --> 01:00:01.887
I want you to stop calling me kid.

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:03.635
Fair enough.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.221
I'm sorry, Lizzy.

01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:18.399
Who was that man in the suit?

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:21.239
Just...

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:23.442
Nothing.

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:24.989
What happened this morning?

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:26.244
Nothing.

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:29.324
It's fine.

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.964
I just had a bit of a bad reaction.

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.506
But there's one more thing
they're going to try,

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:46.886
it's a medicine that's had
some really good results.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.177
Why didn't they try it in the first place?

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:51.016
Because this is something you take

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:54.023
when the other stuff hasn't worked
the way they want it to.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.902
Does that mean it's too late?

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:00.188
No, of course it doesn't mean
it's too late.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.156
Are you sure?

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:06.114
I believe every word I say.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.200
Belief is half of all healing.

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:16.787
Belief in the cure,

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.090
belief in the future that awaits.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.380
Yeah.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:28.804
You know that tree
that I'm always going on about?

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:29.933
Yeah.

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:34.097
Well, this drug is made
from trees like that.

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:35.856
- It is?
- Yeah!

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:36.766
Seriously?

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:41.028
All this time, we could have gone
out there and just chopped it down.

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:43.898
But not that one.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:50.413
That one's our friend.

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:29.819
Where are you?

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:32.575
I'm here.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:37.285
So can you do it?
Can you make my mum better?

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:40.455
If your mother can be healed,
the yew tree will do it.

01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:44.875
So that's a yes?

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.674
You still don't know why you called me.

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:48.970
I didn't call you.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.427
And even if I did,
it was obviously for my mum.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:52.967
- Was it?
- Why else?

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:55.386
To listen to idiotic stories
that make no sense?

01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:59.557
It is not yet time for the third tale.
But soon.

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:03.186
And after that, you will tell me
your story, Conor O'Malley.

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:05.312
No!

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:07.610
No, not this!

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:09.571
That's just a nightmare!

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.281
No, please!

01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:18.497
That's not my truth!
That's just a nightmare!

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:21.879
Nevertheless, this is
what will happen after the third tale.

01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:24.665
I want to know what's going
to happen with my mum.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:28.340
You waste the precious time
that is given to you.

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:30.675
Wait! Where are you going?

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:33.306
You're a tree of healing.
I need you to heal!

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:38.013
And so I shall.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:11.212
Conor, I'll come back. I promise.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.346
And you'll come to LA for Christmas.

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:16.224
I don't want to leave Mum
on her own for Christmas.

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:19.019
- This medicine your mum's taking...
- It's going to make her well.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:21.226
No, Conor. It probably isn't.

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:23.641
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's a last ditch effort.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:25.980
It'll heal her, okay? I know it.

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:30.694
- It's the reason it came, it has to be.
- Reason what came?

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:32.024
The monster.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.660
- Conor, what?
- It comes at 12.07.

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:36.786
At first I thought it was a dream, but...

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:38.614
Conor, stop it. It's a dream.

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:41.079
I'm sorry you have to face this,

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:43.369
but you have to be brave.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:45.754
Do you understand?

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:49.466
C'mon.

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:51.835
C'mon.

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:03.848
I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.394
What if it's not fast enough?

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:15.484
- Conor, listen...
- It's okay.

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:17.244
What's okay?

01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:18.950
Just...

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:20.493
You don't have to.

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:32.941
<i>Look. Can you see? Can you see?</i>

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:34.363
<i>Can you wave?</i>

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:36.114
<i>Can you see him?</i>

01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:40.403
<i>Look, then we wave to Grandma.</i>

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.125
<i>Hello, Grandma!</i>

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:49.582
<i>Con, can you say hello to Grandma and Mum?</i>

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:52.043
<i>Hello, Grandma!</i>

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:53.415
<i>There we go.</i>

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:56.377
<i>Mummy's heard this one a lot.</i>

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:58.713
<i>Okay, you ready?</i>

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.511
<i>Con, look, sit, come sit here.</i>

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:03.555
<i>Con, look.</i>

01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:08.306
- <i>Hello, Grandma.</i>
- <i>Mummy and...</i>

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.183
<i>There we go.</i>

01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:14.106
<i>We're doing you a picture, Grandma.</i>

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.148
<i>And then mix it together.</i>

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:18.861
<i>What colour is that?</i>

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:21.864
- <i>Brown.</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:25.414
<i>It's a nice sludgy brown.</i>

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:28.291
- <i>But we have brown here.</i>
- <i>That's true.</i>

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.545
<i>What can you see?</i>

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:33.835
<i>What's that? What are those?</i>

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.342
<i>What are these?</i>

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:40.425
- <i>The eyes.</i>
- <i>The eyes, that's it.</i>

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:42.890
<i>Life is always in the eyes.</i>

01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:48.099
<i>If you get that,
you'll be a proper artist.</i>

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:50.681
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:07:51.693 --> 01:07:52.774
<i>Look.</i>

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:56.403
<i>This is how we draw the eyes in.</i>

01:07:56.573 --> 01:08:00.283
<i>This is where the eyes
catch the reflection.</i>

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:04.904
<i>Then we see the life
in the eyes, see that?</i>

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.326
<i>Do it again.</i>

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.121
<i>It's life.</i>

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.839
<i>Maybe if we take a pencil,</i>

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:19.969
<i>and you can draw on there...</i>

01:08:20.888 --> 01:08:22.629
<i>Do you want to try it?</i>

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:25.140
<i>Show me how you do it.</i>

01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:38.938
<i>Look, Con.</i>

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.404
<i>That's his hair.</i>

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.862
<i>And this is his eyebrow.</i>

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:49.953
<i>There's the eyes.</i>

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:53.460
<i>Oh, look, there's his mouth.</i>

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:57.335
<i>There's his mouth, he's very angry.</i>

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.170
<i>Can you see?</i>

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.377
<i>Look at that!</i>

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:06.720
<i>And then we start to make a face.</i>

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:08.845
<i>And then...</i>

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.394
<i>There's our monster.</i>

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:13.479
<i>There's the monster.</i>

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:15.314
<i>Look at the monster.</i>

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:51.301
Very slowly.

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:54.854
That's it.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.534
It's a thirty-minute exam this morning,

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:19.376
and this is all the stuff we've
been doing for the last two weeks.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:23.759
So, if you've done your revision,
there won't be any surprises.

01:10:29.016 --> 01:10:32.305
In a moment I'm going
to ask you to turn your pages over

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:35.346
and there will be no talking
for the next thirty minutes.

01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:37.765
I want total silence in here,

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:41.686
because you're going to be using
your brains, not your mouths.

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:46.114
So, thirty minutes, starting now.

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:47.365
Good luck.

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:17.437
I think I've finally figured you out.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.681
After all this time.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:24.778
All that you are looking for
is someone to kick your head in.

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:28.816
But you know what?
I'm not that guy anymore.

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:37.828
Goodbye, O'Malley.

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:40.168
I no longer see you.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.956
Now you are invisible to me too.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.129
I hope your mum gets better.

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:14.319
What took you so long?

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:17.160
It is time for the third tale.

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:23.538
There was once an invisible man,

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:27.128
who had grown tired of being unseen.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:30.711
It was not that he was actually invisible.

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:36.304
It was just that people
had become used to not seeing him.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:41.389
One day, the invisible man
couldn't stand it anymore.

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.141
He kept wondering:

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:46.901
If no one sees you,

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:49.484
are you really there at all?

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.033
What did the invisible man do?

01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:57.658
He called for a monster.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.968
I don't even know
what to say to you, O'Malley.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.892
You sent him to hospital!

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:26.691
His parents are threatening to sue.

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:28.268
It wasn't me.

01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:29.644
What was that?

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:31.613
It wasn't me.

01:13:36.454 --> 01:13:38.821
I'm not invisible! I'm not invisible!

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:41.456
If you want to be seen,
this is not the best way.

01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:42.742
I'm not invisible!

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:45.957
Did you hear me? I'm not invisible!

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:50.541
School rules dictate immediate exclusion.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.586
But how could I do that

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:57.680
and consider myself any kind of teacher?

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:00.805
Go back to class.

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:04.513
We will talk about this one day,
but not today.

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.975
You're not punishing me?

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:12.317
What could possibly be the point?

01:14:24.919 --> 01:14:27.912
Let me give you an example
of emotional wellness.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:31.506
You know how difficult it is
sometimes to say no, right?

01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:35.010
How good it feels when you
finally find the courage to say it.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.213
Why is that?

01:15:22.727 --> 01:15:24.138
Aren't you coming?

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:27.266
I'll be right here.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:03.257
What did you do to your hands?

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:12.061
This is the talk, isn't it?

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:15.143
Everybody wants to have a talk lately.

01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:21.149
Con.

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:24.323
Look at me.

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:31.410
I spoke to the doctor this morning.

01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:40.256
The new treatment, it's not working.

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.888
The one from the yew tree?

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:48.426
Yeah.

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:51.688
How can it not be working?

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:54.474
Things have just moved really fast.

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:56.401
Faster than they thought.

01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:59.984
- But how can it not be working?
- I don't know.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:01.693
It has to.

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.535
So what happens now?

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:12.330
What's gonna be the next treatment?

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.291
I'm so sorry.

01:17:21.053 --> 01:17:23.295
I've never been more sorry

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:26.636
about anything in my life.

01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:39.194
It's okay that you're angry, Con.

01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:42.356
It really is.

01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:47.452
I'm pretty angry too,
to tell you the truth.

01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:51.331
But, Con...

01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:57.958
Con, are you listening?

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:03.669
One day,

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:07.593
if you look back and you feel bad

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:12.018
for being so angry
you couldn't even speak to me,

01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:14.680
you have to know that that was okay,

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:23.571
that I knew.

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:30.036
Because I know everything
you need to tell me

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:33.165
without you having to say it out loud.

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:41.039
And if you need to break things,

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:45.172
by God, you break them.

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:48.972
Break them, good and hard.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:51.383
And I'll be right there, Con.

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:06.611
I wish I had a hundred years.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:15.082
A hundred years I could give to you.

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.190
Wake up!

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:48.648
Wake up!

01:19:50.744 --> 01:19:51.951
Wake up!

01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:53.369
Wake up!

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:54.905
Wake up!

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:56.702
I don't care what time it is!

01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:59.288
You lied! Wake up!

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.461
Wake up!

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:04.038
Wake up!

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:07.170
I need you now!

01:20:21.108 --> 01:20:22.519
You will do yourself harm
if you keep that up.

01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:23.524
It didn't work!

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:26.528
You said the yew tree would
make her better, but it didn't!

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:27.813
Fix her! Make her better!

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:29.814
Conor!

01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:32.988
You were the one who called me,
Conor O'Malley.

01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:35.245
If I called you, it was to save her!

01:20:35.414 --> 01:20:36.450
It was to heal her!

01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:38.455
I did not come to heal her.

01:20:38.625 --> 01:20:39.661
Yes, you did!

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:42.202
- I came to heal you.
- Me?

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:44.663
I'm not the one who needs healing!

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:48.174
How many times do I have to tell you?

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:50.676
My mum's the one who.

01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:05.646
Help me.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:15.069
It is time for the fourth tale.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:19.572
No!

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.412
No, please! Get me out of here!

01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:23.076
It is time for your nightmare.

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:24.869
I need to get back to my mum!

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:27.289
She is already here.

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:33.586
No!

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:35.175
Mum, get out of here!

01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:36.715
I'm fine!

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:39.100
It's all right.
There's nothing to worry about.

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:41.010
Mum, run! Please, run!

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.430
Mum!

01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:53.606
Mum!

01:21:58.372 --> 01:21:59.704
Conor!

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:01.368
Mum!

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:08.454
Mum!

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:10.169
Mum!

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:11.082
Conor!

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.250
Mum!

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:14.260
- Don't let me go!
- I won't!

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:18.472
- Conor!
- Mum!

01:22:18.642 --> 01:22:19.678
Conor!

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:21.093
Mum!

01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:46.709
Conor!

01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:49.292
- Here is the fourth tale.
- Help!

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:51.422
Here is the truth of Conor O'Malley.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.427
Here is your nightmare.

01:23:08.942 --> 01:23:10.058
Mum!

01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:11.392
Mum!

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:14.521
Mum!

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:21.152
Mum!

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:48.016
This is when I wake up.

01:23:49.608 --> 01:23:51.600
This is when I always wake up.

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:54.526
The tale is not yet told.

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:56.653
Get me out of here! I need to see my mum!

01:23:56.823 --> 01:23:58.906
She is no longer here, Conor.

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:00.904
I couldn't hold on to her any more.

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:03.027
Conor!

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:05.537
- Speak the truth!
- No!

01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:08.954
Speak the truth
or you will never leave this place.

01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:11.411
What truth? I don't know what you mean!

01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:14.205
You must tell me the fourth tale,
Conor O'Malley.

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:17.547
You must tell me your nightmare
before it is too late.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:20.462
Yes! Tell me, Conor! Tell me the truth!

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:23.803
- It'll kill me if I do!
- It will kill you if you do not!

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:26.388
- Speak the truth!
- No!

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:29.396
The truth, Conor O'Malley!
Tell me the truth, boy!

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:30.305
No!

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:35.648
- Speak the truth!
- No!

01:24:35.821 --> 01:24:39.690
- Speak the truth, boy!
- I want it to be over!

01:24:51.545 --> 01:24:54.379
I can't stand knowing that she'll go.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:58.048
I want it to be finished.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.876
I let her fall.

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:01.461
I let her die.

01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:28.070
That was brave, Conor.

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.700
You finally said it.

01:25:34.254 --> 01:25:36.041
Why didn't it kill me?

01:25:37.007 --> 01:25:38.748
I deserve punishment.

01:25:39.885 --> 01:25:41.672
I deserve the worst.

01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:44.095
Do you?

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:50.017
I've known forever
that she wasn't going to make it.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:53.764
She'd keep telling me
she was getting better all the time

01:25:55.233 --> 01:25:57.475
because that's what I wanted to hear.

01:25:58.487 --> 01:26:00.399
And I believed her.

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:04.069
Except I didn't.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:12.077
And I started to think
how much I wanted it to be over.

01:26:14.795 --> 01:26:18.254
I couldn't stand how alone
it would make me feel.

01:26:19.383 --> 01:26:23.753
A part of you wished it would end,
even if it meant losing her.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.597
I let her go.

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:31.972
I could have held on for longer,

01:26:33.146 --> 01:26:35.012
but I always let her go.

01:26:35.482 --> 01:26:39.476
And that is your truth, Conor O'Malley.

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:45.899
I don't want it to be, though.

01:26:46.493 --> 01:26:47.859
Now it's for real.

01:26:48.662 --> 01:26:51.325
Now she's going to die and it's my fault.

01:26:51.498 --> 01:26:54.536
And that is not the truth at all.

01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:58.420
You were merely wishing
for an end of pain. Your own pain.

01:26:58.588 --> 01:27:02.127
- It is the most human wish there is.
- I didn't mean it, though.

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:05.551
You did, but you also did not.

01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:10.348
How can both be true?

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:14.557
How can a prince be a murderer
and be loved by his people?

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:18.644
How can an apothecary
be evil-tempered but right-thinking?

01:27:18.817 --> 01:27:22.561
How can invisible men make themselves
more lonely by being seen?

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:23.603
I don't know.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:26.318
Your stories never made any sense to me.

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:28.983
Because humans are complicated beasts.

01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:30.697
You believe comforting lies

01:27:30.871 --> 01:27:35.161
while knowing full well the painful truth
that makes those lies necessary.

01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:39.244
In the end, Conor,
it is not important what you think.

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:43.381
It is only important what you do.

01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:45.208
So what do I do?

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:48.758
What you did just now.
You speak the truth.

01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:49.967
That's all?

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:51.722
You think it's easy?

01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:54.885
You were willing to die
rather than speak it.

01:27:57.230 --> 01:28:00.598
I'm so tired. So tired of all of this.

01:28:01.067 --> 01:28:02.433
Then sleep.

01:28:02.986 --> 01:28:03.976
There's time.

01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:06.813
Are you sure? I need to see my mum.

01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:09.232
We will both see her tonight.

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:10.908
Will you be there?

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:12.284
Yes.

01:28:12.746 --> 01:28:16.205
It will be the final steps of my walking.

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:21.836
How does the fourth story end?

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.422
Sleep.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:27.967
Sleep.

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:30.252
Sleep.

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:05.830
Thank God!

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:06.997
Conor!

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:08.332
Conor!

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:13.467
I've been out of my mind
trying to find you.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:16.553
- There was something I had to.
- No time. We have to go now.

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:41.202
Damn it!

01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:48.089
Grandma.

01:29:49.676 --> 01:29:51.292
I'm sorry.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.712
About the sitting room and...

01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:55.596
and everything.

01:29:58.101 --> 01:29:59.967
It doesn't matter.

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:02.553
It doesn't matter.

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:18.906
You know, Conor?

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.742
You and me...

01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:24.083
We are not the most natural fit, are we?

01:30:26.129 --> 01:30:28.166
No. I guess not.

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.923
I guess not either.

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:35.052
But we're going to have to learn.

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:38.130
I know.

01:30:38.308 --> 01:30:40.015
You do know, don't you?

01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:42.093
Of course you do.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:50.519
But there is one thing we have in common.

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:53.313
Your mum.

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:00.953
That's what we have in common.

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:18.355
It's okay.

01:32:19.034 --> 01:32:20.491
I see you found him.

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:23.489
Thank you.

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:32.161
Hello, my darling.

01:32:33.089 --> 01:32:35.081
- Ma?
- Yes, I'm here.

01:32:35.842 --> 01:32:37.959
I'm here. Can you feel my hand?

01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:42.801
- And Conor's here, too.
- Is he?

01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:30.140
Here is the end of the tale.

01:33:32.565 --> 01:33:34.147
I'm afraid.

01:33:34.818 --> 01:33:36.275
Of course you are afraid.

01:33:38.071 --> 01:33:39.437
It will be hard.

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:41.981
It will be more than hard.

01:33:42.992 --> 01:33:46.451
But you will make it through,
Conor O'Malley.

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:48.991
You'll stay?

01:33:50.166 --> 01:33:52.453
I will be right here.

01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:02.043
What do I do?

01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:08.512
Now all that is left is for you
to speak the simplest truth of all.

01:34:30.415 --> 01:34:32.498
I don't want you to go.

01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:34.875
I know, my love.

01:34:41.551 --> 01:34:43.008
I don't want you to go.

01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:51.903
<i>How does the fourth story end?</i>

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:55.824
<i>It ends with the boy
holding on tight to his mother.</i>

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.212
<i>And by doing so,
he can finally let her go.</i>

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:45.129
Conor.

01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:55.383
This is your room now.

01:36:55.768 --> 01:36:58.010
I've been making it ready.

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:03.898
Thank you.
