03:37.233 --> 03:38.567
- OH, MY GOD!

03:38.567 --> 03:41.267
THEY COULD'VE
BURNED THE HOUSE DOWN.

03:41.267 --> 03:43.333
- WHO TOLD YOU
YOU COULD MAKE PANCAKES?

03:43.333 --> 03:46.500
- I SMELL PANCAKES.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.033
- DO YOU KNOW
HOW DANGEROUS IT IS

03:48.033 --> 03:49.400
TO BE PLAYING WITH A STOVE?

03:49.400 --> 03:51.467
- WHERE ARE THE PANCAKES?

03:51.467 --> 03:53.000
- YOU WANT A PANCAKE, GRANDPA?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.533
- WHAT THE HELL

03:56.900 --> 03:58.467
- ALLY, WHEN DID
YOU GET HERE?

03:58.467 --> 04:00.333
- THE SPENCERS DROPPED ME OFF
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

04:00.333 --> 04:03.000
- SO YOU WERE ALONE HERE
WITH THE BOYS?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.400
YOU MADE THE PANCAKES?

04:04.400 --> 04:06.833
- YEAH. THE BOYS WERE HUNGRY,
SO I FED THEM.

04:06.833 --> 04:08.367

WELL...YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

04:15.833 --> 04:17.400
WELL, THAT'S GREAT!

04:17.400 --> 04:19.233
YOU'RE DADDY'S BIG GIRL,
AREN'T YOU, HONEY?

04:19.233 --> 04:21.667
GIMME A PANCAKE.

04:21.667 --> 04:23.500
- GIMME THREE PANCAKES.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.200
- I ONLY HAD
A COUPLE LEFT, GRANDPA,

04:27.200 --> 04:28.833
AND THEY CAME OUT
KIND OF UGLY.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.867
- THIS STOMACH
KNOWS NOT UGLY.

04:31.867 --> 04:36.300
- AW, ALLY, HONEY,
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU...

04:36.300 --> 04:40.200
- YOUR MOTHER COULD BE
FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.467
- LISTEN, MARIE,
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

04:47.167 --> 04:49.367
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

04:49.367 --> 04:52.100
- YOU THINK I WANNA
THINK THESE THINGS?

04:52.100 --> 04:53.533
I DON'T.

04:53.533 --> 04:56.467
BUT THEN I LOOK AROUND,
AND, UH, HUH...

04:58.333 --> 05:01.233
- AND EVERY TIME I LOOK AROUND,
YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE?

05:01.233 --> 05:02.567
- HEY! HEY!
TRY ONE OF THESE.

05:02.567 --> 05:04.433
LOOK, IT'S A BUNNY.
HI, I'M A BUNNY.

05:04.433 --> 05:08.100
OH, THE BOTTOM
OF A COW, HUH?

05:14.100 --> 05:16.600
- DELICIOUS.
I'M DONE.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.667
BYE.

05:19.100 --> 05:22.367
COME ON, MARIE,
MAKE ME LUNCH.

05:22.367 --> 05:24.533
- HONEY, LISTEN,
I'LL GET THAT.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.733
- I CAN DO IT.

05:25.733 --> 05:27.533
- NO, HONEY, YOU'VE
HELPED MOMMY OUT ENOUGH.

05:27.533 --> 05:31.033
- YES, YOU HAVE, DEAR,
AND THANK GOD FOR YOU.

05:31.033 --> 05:34.667
YOU HAVE LEARNED
RESPONSIBILITY AND COOKING

05:34.667 --> 05:37.233
AGAINST ALL ODDS.

05:40.533 --> 05:42.633
- [sighs]
[door closes]

05:42.633 --> 05:45.967
IT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.

05:45.967 --> 05:47.000
- YEAH.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.367
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

05:48.367 --> 05:51.267
EVERYTHING WE DO
HAPPENS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.433
- ARE WE TERRIBLE PARENTS?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.500
- PROBABLY.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.000
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.133
I MEAN, HOW BAD COULD WE BE?
LOOK.

06:01.133 --> 06:03.200
LOOK AT HER.
SHE DID GREAT.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.567
SHE TOOK CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

06:04.567 --> 06:06.367
WE MUST BE DOING
SOMETHING RIGHT.

06:06.367 --> 06:10.300
WE RAISED A KID WHO'S RAISING
THE REST OF THE KIDS.

06:11.933 --> 06:14.467
- I'M NOT SURE THAT'S
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

06:14.467 --> 06:15.833
- WOULD YOU LIKE
ANOTHER PANCAKE, DADDY?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.133
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I'M STARVIN'.

06:17.133 --> 06:18.500
- LOOK,
I MADE YOU A FOOTBALL.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.867
- OH, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE LIKE AN ARTIST--

06:19.867 --> 06:21.333
A PANCAKE ARTIST.

06:21.333 --> 06:24.467
THAT'S THE KIND OF ART
THAT DADDY APPRECIATES.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.000
- I LIKE
DOING THIS STUFF.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.767
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I COULD DO?

06:27.767 --> 06:30.100
YOU MEAN YOU WANT TO DO MORE
STUFF AROUND THE HOUSE?

06:30.100 --> 06:31.233
- SURE. IT WAS FUN.

06:31.233 --> 06:32.767
- OF COURSE IT'S FUN.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.667
IT'S FUN TO HELP MOMMY.

06:38.067 --> 06:39.400
- LISTEN, I MEAN,
I WOULD BE THRILLED

06:39.400 --> 06:40.667
TO GET SOME MORE HELP
AROUND HERE.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.533
THERE'S CLEANING
AND LAUNDRY AND--

06:43.533 --> 06:46.133
- COOKING.

06:46.133 --> 06:48.333
- WELL, MAYBE SOME TIME
WHEN YOU GUYS GO OUT,

06:48.333 --> 06:49.967
I CAN BABYSIT FOR REAL.

06:49.967 --> 06:51.333
- OH, I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.233
- BUT YOU SAID I DID A GOOD JOB
WITH THE BOYS.

06:53.233 --> 06:54.733
- IT'S TRUE...RIGHT?

06:54.733 --> 06:59.067
TWINS ALIVE,
HOUSE--HOUSE NOT ON FIRE,

06:59.067 --> 07:00.667
PANCAKES IN STOMACH.

07:02.667 --> 07:06.133
- WELL, A LOT OF GIRLS
HER AGE DO BABYSIT.

07:06.133 --> 07:08.733
- AND COOK.

07:08.733 --> 07:10.167
IN SOME COUNTRIES,

07:10.167 --> 07:12.467
SHE'D BE MARRIED
AND RUNNING HER OWN FARM.

07:15.233 --> 07:16.500
- I DON'T KNOW.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.400
IT STILL MAKES ME
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.467
- YEAH. YOU KNOW,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, HONEY,

07:20.467 --> 07:22.133
WHEN IT COMES
TO BABYSITTING,

07:22.133 --> 07:24.433
WE KINDA
LEAVE THAT UP TO GRANDMA.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.400
- YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

07:31.400 --> 07:34.467
WHY DON'T YOU

07:34.467 --> 07:37.267
- I CAN BABYSIT?
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. NO, NO.

07:37.267 --> 07:39.467
- YOU CAN BABYSIT!
- YES!

07:39.467 --> 07:43.367
BOYS, MOM AND DAD

07:44.467 --> 07:45.500
- WELL...

07:45.500 --> 07:46.867
OKAY, BUT WAIT A MINUTE NOW.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.567
YOU'RE NOT CUTTING
MY MOTHER OUT ENTIRELY.

07:49.567 --> 07:50.933
- THIS COULD BE
THE BEGINNING.

07:50.933 --> 07:52.233
- NO, NO.
NO, NO, LISTEN.

07:52.233 --> 07:53.667

07:53.667 --> 07:55.433

I JUST LIKE PANCAKES.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.800

ALLY IS GROWING UP.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.067
SHE'S MATURE.
SHE'S RESPONSIBLE.

07:58.067 --> 07:59.233
SHE WANTS TO HELP OUT.

07:59.233 --> 08:00.900
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
BUT MY MOTHER--

08:00.900 --> 08:02.100

09:11.700 --> 09:15.567
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:15.567 --> 09:17.433
- NO, I'M JUST SAYING
SHE'S LOOKIN' GOOD,

09:17.433 --> 09:20.067
YOU KNOW,
ALL GLOWY AND HAPPY.

09:22.733 --> 09:24.067
- YEAH, YEAH,
YOU ARE LOOKIN' GOOD.

09:24.067 --> 09:25.933
WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.333
- NOTHING.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.267
I JUST FEEL GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

09:32.767 --> 09:35.000
- OH, ALLY.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.333
ALLY, HONEY...

09:40.600 --> 09:42.167
YOU DROPPED A SOCK.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.267
YOU MIGHT WANNA GET THE BOYS
STARTED ON BEDTIME.

09:48.267 --> 09:49.367
- OKAY, MOMMY.

09:49.367 --> 09:52.267
MICHAEL, GEOFFREY,
PAJAMAS!

09:52.267 --> 09:54.133
- HEY, ALLY,
SWEETIE, UH,

09:54.133 --> 09:56.067
I THINK MY GRILLED CHEESE
IS BURNING.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.133
- OKAY, GRANDPA.

09:57.133 --> 09:58.400
- HEY, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

09:58.400 --> 09:59.933
HOW 'BOUT ONE MORE
FOR THE OLD MAN?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.233
- OKAY, DADDY.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.700
- AND ONE MORE
FOR THE HANDSOME MAN.

10:03.700 --> 10:06.167
- WELL, THANK YOU, DAD,
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE ONE TOO.

10:06.167 --> 10:09.300
[laughing]

10:21.467 --> 10:23.033
- YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES
THIS SANDWICH SO GREAT?

10:24.067 --> 10:27.700
DOESN'T COME
WITH A SIDE OF MARIE.

10:27.700 --> 10:30.200
- FRANK.

10:30.200 --> 10:34.133
- SOMEBODY
SCREWED UP YOUR ORDER.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.433
- FRANK,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:35.433 --> 10:37.733
LEE AND STAN
ARE COMING OVER FOR DINNER

10:37.733 --> 10:38.867
IN A HALF AN HOUR.

10:38.867 --> 10:40.300
- I'M LOOSENING UP.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.367
- HEY, MA, WOULD YOU
LIKE ALLY TO MAKE YOU

10:42.367 --> 10:43.833
ONE OF THESE
GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES?

10:43.833 --> 10:47.133
I SWEAR, THEY'RE THE BEST
I EVER TA--

10:49.467 --> 10:53.500
- * TA...AKE ME
OUT TO THE BALL GAME *

10:53.500 --> 10:57.733
both: * TAKE ME OUT
TO THE CROWD *

10:57.733 --> 11:00.933
* BUY ME SOME PEANUTS
AND CRACKER JACK *

11:00.933 --> 11:03.167
- ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

11:05.467 --> 11:07.033
OH, HONEY,

11:07.033 --> 11:08.233
YOU'RE DOING THAT ALL WRONG.

11:08.233 --> 11:09.867
LET GRANDMA SHOW YOU
HOW TO DO THAT.

11:09.867 --> 11:12.000
- HEY, BUTT OUT,
SHE'S BUSY.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.167
- FINE.
WE HAVE TO GO ANYWAY.

11:14.167 --> 11:16.167
I DON'T WANNA BE LATE
FOR LEE AND STAN.

11:16.167 --> 11:17.433
- OH, YEAH.
MOM AND DAD,

11:17.433 --> 11:19.300
YOU GUYS SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING TOO.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.967
- OH, YEAH, RAY.
YOU KNOW, SHE'S RIGHT.

11:20.967 --> 11:22.433
COME ON.
WE GOTTA BE THERE BY 8:00.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.733
- [mumbles]
- WAIT.

11:23.733 --> 11:25.833
YOU'RE ALL GOING OUT?

11:25.833 --> 11:27.533
- UH...

11:27.533 --> 11:29.533
NOT OUT, IN.

11:29.533 --> 11:32.533
IN--INTO THE LIVING ROOM.
WE WANNA BE THERE BY 8:00.

11:32.533 --> 11:34.900
YEAH.

11:34.900 --> 11:37.033
- RAY, RAY...

11:37.033 --> 11:39.600
RELAX.
WE CAN TELL HER.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.667
- WELL, HA...

11:42.233 --> 11:43.667
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.333
BUT YOU'RE
CUTTIN' IT CLOSE, YOU KNOW?

11:45.333 --> 11:48.600
UH, I'M GONNA
MEET YOU BY THE COUCH.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.200
- I'LL BE
AT THE COFFEE TABLE.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.167
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE.
TELL ME WHAT?

11:53.167 --> 11:57.933
- GUYS, GUYS, COME ON.
MARIE WILL UNDERSTAND.

11:57.933 --> 11:59.133
WE'RE GOING OUT TONIGHT,

11:59.133 --> 12:02.700
AND WE'VE ASKED
ALLY TO BABYSIT.

12:02.700 --> 12:06.100
- OH, I UNDERSTAND...

12:06.100 --> 12:09.033
YOU'RE INSANE.

12:09.033 --> 12:10.300
- IT'S OKAY, GRANDMA.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.033
I BABYSAT
THE LAST TWO NIGHTS.

12:12.033 --> 12:13.633
- ALLY, SWEETIE, UH...

12:13.633 --> 12:15.467
THAT LAUNDRY'S
NOT GONNA FOLD ITSELF.

12:15.467 --> 12:18.200
COME ON.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.267
- MARIE, ALLY WILL BE FINE.

12:20.267 --> 12:22.467
I USED TO BABYSIT
WHEN I WAS HER AGE.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.900
- AND YOU USED TO SMOKE TOO,
DIDN'T YOU?

12:26.900 --> 12:28.900
- I DID NOT SMOKE.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.900
- WELL, YOUR PARENTS WERE
VERY LIBERAL, WEREN'T THEY?

12:31.900 --> 12:33.000
- YES, BUT...

12:33.000 --> 12:35.300
- THEY WERE HIPPIES.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.633
- THEY WERE NOT HIPPIES.

12:36.633 --> 12:38.067
I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION.

12:38.067 --> 12:39.733
WE'RE GOING
TO THE MOVIES.

12:39.733 --> 12:42.133
- YES. TO THE MOVIES WE GO.
- YEAH. LET'S GO TO THE MOVIES.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.033
- WELL, I'M STAYING
RIGHT HERE.

12:44.033 --> 12:45.367
- OKAY, GOOD NIGHT.

12:45.367 --> 12:46.933
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HAVING GUESTS OVER.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.967
- IT WAS JUST LEE AND STAN.
ENOUGH WITH THEM ALREADY.

12:48.967 --> 12:50.767
- ALL RIGHT.
BYE-BYE.

12:50.767 --> 12:52.700
- WELL, THEN, I GUESS
I'M THE ONLY ONE

12:52.700 --> 12:56.167
WHO THINKS THE CHILDREN
ARE IMPORTANT.

13:08.333 --> 13:11.100
- RAY, GET BACK IN HERE.

13:41.267 --> 13:44.833
MARIE, I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S BEST FOR MY KIDS.

13:44.833 --> 13:46.033
- OH, REALLY?

13:46.033 --> 13:48.867
BY MAKING YOUR DAUGHTER
COOK AND CLEAN?

13:48.867 --> 13:50.533
LOOK AT
THE POOR LITTLE THING.

13:50.533 --> 13:54.600
SHE'S TOO YOUNG TO BE FOLDING
GROWN-UP UNDERWEAR.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.233
WHAT'S NEXT? YOU GONNA
HAVE HER SWEEP THE CHIMNEY?

13:57.233 --> 14:00.000
- MA, COME ON.
SHE'S NOT SNOW WHITE.

14:05.233 --> 14:08.367
- CINDERELLA.
- SHUT UP.

14:13.567 --> 14:15.833
- MARIE, LOOK, WE'RE JUST
TRYING TO TELL ALLY

14:15.833 --> 14:18.500
THAT WE TRUST HER ENOUGH
TO TAKE ON MORE RESPONSIBILITY.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.200
- BY MAKING HER
INTO A SLAVE?

14:20.200 --> 14:22.300
- SHE'S NOT A SLAVE.
- YEAH.

14:22.300 --> 14:23.967
COME ON, THIS IS NOTHING
COMPARED TO WHAT

14:23.967 --> 14:25.300
DAD MADE US DO
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.533
- THAT'S TRUE.
TALK ABOUT SLAVES.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.100
- I BEG YOUR FREAKIN' PARDON.

14:31.533 --> 14:34.433
- COME ON.

14:34.433 --> 14:35.533
UH, UH,

14:35.533 --> 14:37.433
"RAKE THOSE LEAVES.
SHOVEL THAT SNOW."

14:37.433 --> 14:40.167
- "CHANGE THAT TIRE.
LIFT THAT PIANO."

14:42.800 --> 14:44.833
- HEY, I ONLY ASKED
YOU TWO BOZOS TO DO STUFF

14:44.833 --> 14:47.133
SO YOU COULD FEEL
THAT YOU WEREN'T WORTHLESS.

14:47.133 --> 14:49.067
IT'S CALLED
BEING A GOOD FATHER.

14:49.067 --> 14:50.300
- YEAH. HA.
- [mumbling]

14:50.300 --> 14:51.900
- HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

14:51.900 --> 14:53.433
I EVEN PAID YOU.

14:53.433 --> 14:55.600
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.
ONE NICKEL.

14:56.967 --> 14:59.367
ONE TIME.

14:59.367 --> 15:01.467
- AND WE HAD TO SHARE IT.

15:05.067 --> 15:07.267
- HEY, HEY,
REMEMBER THE TIME

15:07.267 --> 15:08.800
WE--WE PUT
OUR NICKEL TOGETHER

15:08.800 --> 15:10.400
AND BOUGHT NOTHING?

15:13.333 --> 15:15.200
- OKAY, SO, UH,
HOW MUCH ARE YOU PAYING

15:15.200 --> 15:17.167
YOUR LITTLE HELPER?

15:17.167 --> 15:19.567
- WELL, ACTUALLY...

15:19.567 --> 15:21.533
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN
INTO ANY SPECIFICS YET.

15:21.533 --> 15:23.367
YEAH. WE'RE
CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS.

15:24.900 --> 15:26.567
- ALLY, COME IN HERE.

15:26.567 --> 15:28.300
- UH, ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

15:28.300 --> 15:30.400
- YOU WANNA CRUNCH NUMBERS?
LET'S CRUNCH.

15:30.400 --> 15:34.400
I UNDERSTAND YOU DO NOT
RECEIVE COMPENSATION.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.300
- WHAT?

15:35.300 --> 15:36.600
- THEY'RE NOT PAYING YOU.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.800
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
DAD, WE GET IT.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.733
- NO. I'M GLAD YOU POINTED OUT
WHAT A BAD FATHER I WAS.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.300
I WOULD HATE TO SEE YOU
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.

15:47.333 --> 15:48.967
- HOW DOES $10
AN HOUR GRAB YOU?

15:48.967 --> 15:50.100
- FRANK.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.233
- EXCUSE ME.
I'M TALKING TO MY CLIENT.

15:54.233 --> 15:56.933
YOU LIKE NICE THINGS,
DON'T YOU?

15:56.933 --> 15:59.800
PARTY SHOES, TAFFY...

15:59.800 --> 16:01.900
DOLLS THAT PEE.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.933
- FRANK,

16:04.933 --> 16:08.900
WE GIVE ALLY
ALL THAT SHE NEEDS.

16:08.900 --> 16:11.200
- THAT IS MANAGEMENT TALKING.

16:11.200 --> 16:15.033
- I THINK THIS WHOLE TOPIC
IS INAPPROPRIATE.

16:15.033 --> 16:16.433
ALLY SHOULD NOT BE PAID

16:16.433 --> 16:18.533
BECAUSE THE CHILD
SHOULDN'T BE WORKING.

16:18.533 --> 16:20.800
SHE SHOULD BE OUT
CHASING BUTTERFLIES

16:20.800 --> 16:22.633
AND HOPPING SCOTCH.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.300
- OKAY.
HERE ARE HER DEMANDS--

16:32.300 --> 16:35.833
$10 PER HOUR,
BEDTIME OF HER CHOOSING,

16:35.833 --> 16:39.467
AN ASSORTMENT OF SUGARY
BREAKFAST CEREALS...

16:39.467 --> 16:42.667
- OHH, LUCKY CHARMS JUST ADDED
A NEW MARSHMALLOW SHAPE.

16:47.433 --> 16:49.400
RAINBOWS.

16:50.733 --> 16:52.633
- UH, SHE ALSO WANTS
A BUCKET OF CHICKEN,

16:52.633 --> 16:55.533
AND HER GRANDMOTHER
SHOULD TAKE A LONG VACATION.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.067
THAT'S MY COMMISSION.

16:59.067 --> 17:02.667
- DAD, LOOK, WE'RE NOT GONNA
PLAY YOUR STUPID GAME.

17:02.667 --> 17:06.500
- GAME?
YOU THINK THIS IS A GAME?

17:06.500 --> 17:07.867
WALK AWAY.

17:07.867 --> 17:09.233
- WHAT?

17:09.233 --> 17:10.700
- WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.633
- WHERE AM I GOING?

17:12.633 --> 17:14.567
- NOWHERE, HONEY.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.067
- YES, YOU ARE.
YOU'RE GOING ON STRIKE!

17:17.067 --> 17:19.300
WE'RE SHUTTIN' YOU DOWN!

17:20.467 --> 17:23.733
- I'M AVAILABLE,
IF YOU NEED ME.

17:23.733 --> 17:26.600
AND IT WON'T
COST YOU ANYTHING.

17:26.600 --> 17:29.167
- YO, SCAB,
YOU LIKE YOUR KNEECAPS?

17:29.167 --> 17:31.300
- OKAY, UH,
YOU KNOW, I...

17:35.967 --> 17:37.400
I--I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.300
FRANK, MARIE, IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO LEAVE.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.833
NOW THAT ALLY
IS AT A POINT

17:40.833 --> 17:42.800
WHERE SHE CAN
DO MORE AROUND THE HOUSE,

17:42.800 --> 17:47.900
WE WON'T BE NEEDING
AS MUCH...OUTSIDE HELP.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.533
- WELL, DEBRA, THAT SOUNDS

17:49.533 --> 17:51.667
LIKE YOU DON'T
WANT ME HERE AT ALL.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.367
- UH, NO, NO.

17:54.367 --> 18:00.367
NO, WE WELCOME YOU
AND YOUR DELIGHTFUL WAY.

18:00.367 --> 18:06.133
- NO, DEBRA'S NEVER BEEN
COMFORTABLE ACCEPTING MY HELP.

18:06.133 --> 18:07.867
AND I THINK NOW YOU'RE...

18:07.867 --> 18:11.867
TRYING TO USE THIS SITUATION
TO SHUT ME OUT ALTOGETHER.

18:11.867 --> 18:13.800
- MARIE, YOU THINK
I HAVE TIME TO SIT AROUND

18:13.800 --> 18:16.467
AND COME UP WITH SCHEMES
TO GET YOU OUT OF MY LIFE?

18:16.467 --> 18:20.833
- YEAH, MA, COME ON.
THAT'S NOT ALL SHE DOES.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.433
SOMETIMES SHE READS.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.600
- MARIE, LOOK,
WE ARE DOING THIS

18:27.600 --> 18:30.300
BECAUSE THIS
IS WHAT ALLY WANTS.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.433
- WHAT ALLY WANTS!

18:32.433 --> 18:34.733
- EVER SINCE WE LET HER
TAKE ON MORE RESPONSIBILITY,

18:34.733 --> 18:35.933
SHE'S BLOSSOMED.

18:35.933 --> 18:38.033
- LIKE A CHRYSANTHEMUM.

18:42.633 --> 18:45.233
- SHE'S MORE CONFIDENT,
SHE'S INDEPENDENT,

18:45.233 --> 18:47.733
AND SHE'S HAPPY.

18:47.733 --> 18:49.933
AND ISN'T
THAT WHAT WE ALL WANT,

18:49.933 --> 18:51.667
FOR ALLY TO BE HAPPY?

18:57.033 --> 18:58.400
- SO, SWEETIE,
DO YOU LIKE BABY-SITTING?

18:59.200 --> 19:01.200
DOES IT MAKE YOU HAPPY?
- YEAH.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.367
- BUT NOT FOR FREE.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.200
ALLY,
YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.433
LOOK AT THE NAPKIN--

19:05.433 --> 19:09.200
I WAS WORKING OUR WAY
UP TO PONY.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.900
- ALL RIGHT.
JUST STOP IT, DAD, OKAY?

19:10.900 --> 19:13.167
ALLY IS HAPPY,
AND THAT'S ALL WE CARE ABOUT--

19:13.167 --> 19:14.400
MAKING ALLY HAPPY.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.600
- REALLY?
- YES, OF COURSE, HONEY.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.800
- OH...BECAUSE...

19:19.800 --> 19:23.633
MOLLY INVITED ME OVER TONIGHT,
AND I KINDA WANTED TO GO,

19:23.633 --> 19:27.800
BUT I TOLD HER I COULDN'T
BECAUSE I WAS BABYSITTING.

19:27.800 --> 19:32.100
- WELL, HONEY, YOU SHOULD
DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.567
- SO I CAN GO TO MOLLY'S?
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE MOVIES?

19:34.567 --> 19:36.733
- SURE, HONEY,
YOU CAN GO TO MOLLY'S.

19:36.733 --> 19:37.867
RIGHT, DADDY?

19:37.867 --> 19:39.567
- WELL, UH...YEAH.

19:39.567 --> 19:41.333
YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH.

19:41.333 --> 19:44.200
YEAH, WE ONLY CARE
ABOUT YOUR HAPPINESS.

19:45.433 --> 19:47.000
- GREAT.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.267
OH, AND WERE YOU SERIOUS
ABOUT THE MONEY?

19:50.267 --> 19:52.533
'CAUSE I DID DO
A LOT OF LAUNDRY.

19:52.533 --> 19:56.100
- OH. OH, YEAH.
OKAY. YEAH, SURE.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.933
OH.
I ONLY GOT A 20.

19:58.933 --> 20:00.700
- THAT'S GOOD.
- WH--

20:00.700 --> 20:01.833
- HERE YOU GO, HONEY.

20:01.833 --> 20:02.933
- THANK YOU, GRANDPA.

20:02.933 --> 20:05.133
- THAT'S MY GIRL.

20:46.467 --> 20:48.800
WHOA.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.033
WELL, UM ...

20:51.033 --> 20:54.400

SHOULDN'T GO TO THE MOVIES.

20:55.700 --> 20:58.267
OH, WAIT. YEAH,
THERE'S A REASON RIGHT THERE.

20:58.267 --> 21:00.267
THAT'S ONE REASON.

21:03.133 --> 21:05.033
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART
OF BABYSITTING.

21:05.033 --> 21:06.700
[both laugh]

21:06.700 --> 21:09.467

21:28.433 --> 21:30.800
- ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR AGO.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.533
- THAT'S PRETTY LATE.

21:32.533 --> 21:35.667
WHAT, DID YOU LET THEM
HAVE CHOCOLATE OR SOMETHING?

21:35.667 --> 21:38.267
- NO.

21:38.267 --> 21:42.600
