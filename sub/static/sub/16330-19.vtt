WEBVTT

00:07.797 --> 00:09.331
Welcome to Bangkok.

00:09.333 --> 00:12.375
Do I want to know why you need all this?

00:12.400 --> 00:15.303
I'm not paying you $20
million to ask questions.

00:15.305 --> 00:17.239
But if I was you,

00:17.241 --> 00:20.484
I'd avoid the Western
Hemisphere for a while.

00:24.081 --> 00:26.348
How did Nas find
Sandstorm's bank accounts?

00:26.350 --> 00:29.951
She didn't say. Just said she
had to pull some serious strings.

00:29.953 --> 00:31.186
Whoa.

00:31.188 --> 00:33.088
She's... really good.

00:33.090 --> 00:37.125
Millions kept offshore spread
over dozens of countries?

00:37.127 --> 00:39.384
Can you freeze those accounts?

00:40.486 --> 00:43.415
- Okay. This is not good.
- What?

00:43.440 --> 00:45.667
All the money just funneled
into a single account.

00:45.669 --> 00:48.837
- When?
- Earlier today.

00:48.839 --> 00:52.340
Actually, the price is now 30.

00:52.342 --> 00:54.342
We agreed on 20.

00:54.344 --> 00:57.145
We ran into unanticipated costs.

00:57.147 --> 01:00.515
They ran into unanticipated costs.

01:00.517 --> 01:01.850
Hmm.

01:01.852 --> 01:03.462
Well, that's a shame.

01:04.988 --> 01:05.987
Hey!

01:05.989 --> 01:08.156
Where are you going?

01:08.158 --> 01:10.796
You cannot buy this
stuff in Siam Paragon.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.361
She funneled the money into
a private Panamanian account,

01:13.363 --> 01:17.032
which can only be frozen if you
have a court order, unless...

01:17.034 --> 01:19.034
it's a little tricky, but
I can do a little work...

01:19.036 --> 01:20.942
Look, all right, don't
explain it, just type it.

01:20.967 --> 01:22.900
Okay, typing, typing, typing.

01:23.907 --> 01:26.575
I have a Yakuza enforcer
ready to kill you

01:26.577 --> 01:29.277
and bring me that truck for 10 million.

01:30.480 --> 01:35.150
So why don't I just
kill you right... now?

01:35.152 --> 01:37.719
Because I've already ordered the hit,

01:37.721 --> 01:40.755
and unless I contact
him and call it off,

01:40.757 --> 01:43.020
you're as good as dead.

01:43.045 --> 01:46.584
Unless 20 still works?

01:54.104 --> 01:56.327
Account number.

01:57.174 --> 01:59.226
8-5-7...

02:02.132 --> 02:04.246
- Okay. There.
- _

02:04.248 --> 02:05.447
It's frozen.

02:05.449 --> 02:07.468
... 9-3-5-1.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.378
_

02:13.581 --> 02:16.057
- What the hell?
- No, this is a mistake.

02:16.059 --> 02:17.259
No!

02:17.261 --> 02:19.160
It's a setup!

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.387 --> 02:55.041
- So what now?
- Now nothing. It's frozen.

02:55.066 --> 02:57.580
That's pretty anticlimactic.

03:39.370 --> 03:40.714
Aah!

04:07.908 --> 04:10.305
Pop quiz. For ten points,

04:10.307 --> 04:12.407
who can tell me the
significance of this tattoo?

04:12.409 --> 04:14.290
It's the avatar for the
Russian hacker, right?

04:14.315 --> 04:17.478
Correct. Head to the front of the class.

04:17.481 --> 04:20.749
Serpent-16 was behind
the Nikkei Flash Crash.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.718
He disabled the cooling system
on a French nuclear reactor,

04:23.720 --> 04:25.587
shut down JFK Ground Control.

04:25.589 --> 04:27.985
We've known that he was
connected to this tattoo

04:28.010 --> 04:29.691
for a while now, but the guy is a ghost.

04:29.693 --> 04:31.159
That's him?

04:31.161 --> 04:35.063
The only known photo of
Serpent-16 until today.

04:35.065 --> 04:37.599
Facial rec picked up
our reptilian friend

04:37.601 --> 04:40.568
about 20 minutes ago,
boarding a Metro-North train.

04:40.570 --> 04:41.726
Well, he's a hacker.

04:41.751 --> 04:43.417
What does he need to
come to the U.S. for?

04:43.442 --> 04:46.007
If he physically hooked
into a local network,

04:46.009 --> 04:48.676
he could cause serious
damage to Wall Street,

04:48.678 --> 04:50.245
subways, water lines...

04:50.247 --> 04:51.679
We need to bring him in.

04:51.681 --> 04:54.296
- Where's his train stopping?
- Grand Central.

05:03.923 --> 05:06.227
His train arrived four
minutes ago, so let's split up.

05:06.229 --> 05:08.696
Jane, you two, take the left.

05:08.698 --> 05:10.932
Tasha, you two, take the right.

05:10.934 --> 05:12.564
Keep your eyes peeled.

05:28.885 --> 05:30.430
The target just picked up a dead drop.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.872
Jane, headed your way.

05:31.897 --> 05:35.237
He's holding a yellow
envelope. Black leather jacket.

05:35.262 --> 05:37.905
Target's moving towards the north exit.

05:43.108 --> 05:44.671
Uhh!

05:48.727 --> 05:51.094
Target is down! Repeat, target is down!

05:51.119 --> 05:52.907
Man in overcoat heading
south with the envelope!

05:52.909 --> 05:54.577
- On him!
- It's okay, it's okay...

05:58.915 --> 06:01.483
FBI! Freeze!

06:03.620 --> 06:05.648
How many people are after this thing?

06:07.290 --> 06:08.857
Third party has the package!

06:08.859 --> 06:10.632
He's headed for the tracks!

06:29.372 --> 06:31.193
It's a Rubik's cube.

06:31.273 --> 06:33.286
What the hell is going on?

06:35.852 --> 06:37.852
Two dead hackers,

06:37.854 --> 06:39.404
one that won't talk,

06:39.429 --> 06:41.777
and all we've got to show
for it is this child's toy.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.791
First of all, not a child's toy.

06:43.793 --> 06:45.652
Plenty of mature adults are into cubing.

06:45.677 --> 06:47.996
Second of all, I know
what this is about.

06:47.998 --> 06:50.174
- Leakhub.
- It's a website.

06:50.199 --> 06:53.067
They steal sensitive classified
documents and publish them online.

06:53.069 --> 06:54.669
Leakhub is run by the Garen brothers,

06:54.671 --> 06:58.204
reclusive anarchists who
believe in radical transparency.

06:58.229 --> 07:00.909
So what has this cube
got to do with Leakhub?

07:00.911 --> 07:03.678
The Mannequin Challenge.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.510
Allow me to clarify.

07:11.588 --> 07:14.188
Really? How is that supposed to clarify?

07:14.190 --> 07:16.057
All three of the men
from the train station

07:16.059 --> 07:17.559
had this on their phones.

07:17.561 --> 07:19.714
It's an encrypted
message. Look at the cars.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.260
Line up all three license plates

07:21.285 --> 07:23.815
and you get a dark web address.

07:24.971 --> 07:27.223
"Our time at Leakhub
now comes to an end.

07:27.248 --> 07:30.104
"If you want to take
charge, go here, my friend."

07:30.106 --> 07:32.340
Iambic pentameter. That's classy.

07:32.365 --> 07:34.809
That's the location of the
envelope at the train station.

07:34.811 --> 07:36.744
If the Garens are
looking for a successor,

07:36.769 --> 07:39.170
that means they're looking to
get out of the secret business.

07:39.172 --> 07:42.646
Their entire document cache would
be up for grabs. This is huge.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.162
Yeah, but shouldn't the documents
have been in the envelope?

07:45.187 --> 07:47.677
I mean, why make things so convoluted?

07:47.679 --> 07:49.690
The Garens would never
let it go that easily.

07:49.715 --> 07:52.316
The cube is the next step. It's
probably code for where to go next.

07:52.318 --> 07:55.463
- Well, what's the list?
- Their unreleased files.

07:55.488 --> 07:57.798
Details of covert military operations.

07:57.823 --> 08:01.494
Weapons storage facilities
and CIA cover identities.

08:01.519 --> 08:03.057
If someone else gets
their hands on these...

08:03.082 --> 08:05.129
Thousands of lives could be at risk.

08:08.213 --> 08:09.934
They got the Truman Protocol.

08:09.936 --> 08:12.895
It's the Truman Protocol.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.420
It's everything.

08:14.791 --> 08:17.533
I thought Nas said she couldn't
find anything on the Truman Protocol,

08:17.558 --> 08:19.710
that all record had
been completely erased.

08:19.712 --> 08:21.011
Looks like the Garens found it.

08:21.013 --> 08:23.180
Shepherd's mentor said
the Truman Protocol

08:23.182 --> 08:24.949
is key to her whole plan.

08:24.951 --> 08:26.350
And she killed him to keep it quiet.

08:26.352 --> 08:27.785
If we can get these documents,

08:27.787 --> 08:30.307
then we can blow the
lid off of phase two.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.609

08:54.634 --> 08:57.976
_

08:59.062 --> 09:00.226
_

09:07.250 --> 09:10.118
Destruction of property,
disturbing the peace.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.353
You've had a busy day, Kerry Coleman.

09:12.355 --> 09:13.765
Don't worry.

09:13.790 --> 09:15.890
The American consulate
opens in the morning.

09:15.892 --> 09:19.195
In ten hours, you're their problem.

09:32.709 --> 09:34.444
Do you speak English?

09:34.469 --> 09:36.750
Could I have a glass of water?

09:37.181 --> 09:38.805
Nam?

09:38.830 --> 09:41.197
Water, please?

09:41.222 --> 09:42.785
You think you can cause havoc

09:42.786 --> 09:45.524
all over my city and not pay a price?

09:45.550 --> 09:48.357
You know, this is all
a big misunderstanding.

09:48.359 --> 09:52.225
Until your government bails
you out, you are my prisoner.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.149
So sit down. Shut up.

09:54.174 --> 09:56.665
And speak when spoken to.

10:01.455 --> 10:03.321
Solved the Rubik's cube.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.599
Doesn't look like it.

10:06.624 --> 10:08.202
Not solved, like, unscrambled,

10:08.204 --> 10:09.837
although I could have
in, like, 30 seconds.

10:09.839 --> 10:11.171
20 when I was in tournament shape.

10:11.173 --> 10:13.107
The scrambled pattern was the code.

10:13.109 --> 10:14.308
Exactly.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.844
Every two square combo in the cube

10:16.845 --> 10:19.212
represents a letter or a number.

10:19.215 --> 10:20.814
It's governed by "Roy G. Biv" order,

10:20.816 --> 10:23.650
so you start with the red side
and you work your way around

10:23.652 --> 10:26.755
until you get another dark web address.

10:26.780 --> 10:29.091
"You want to prove that
you can beat the rest?

10:29.116 --> 10:31.595
"Then hack one off this
list is your next test."

10:31.597 --> 10:34.165
The Garens want us to
prove we're real hackers

10:34.167 --> 10:36.192
by stealing one of these files.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.970
So what do they mean by "beat the rest"?

10:38.971 --> 10:40.871
The Garens circulated
a bunch of versions

10:40.873 --> 10:42.673
of that mannequin challenge video.

10:42.675 --> 10:45.621
They had dead drop
locations all over the world.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.579
So this isn't the only Rubik's cube.

10:47.604 --> 10:50.638
And we're not the only ones competing
for the Leakhub document cache.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.540
The Garens want to hand
over their entire site

10:52.542 --> 10:54.275
to whoever wins a scavenger hunt?

10:54.277 --> 10:55.710
That's the culture.

10:55.712 --> 10:57.313
Hackers love puzzle hunts.

10:57.338 --> 10:58.430
Except the winner of this one

10:58.455 --> 10:59.899
gets the most dangerous
documents in the world.

10:59.924 --> 11:02.671
Can't we just fake one
of these wish list files?

11:02.696 --> 11:04.085
They'll spot a counterfeit.

11:04.087 --> 11:06.032
We need to hack one of these for real.

11:06.057 --> 11:07.557
So which one can we do

11:07.582 --> 11:09.741
without causing an international
diplomatic incident?

11:09.766 --> 11:12.601
Uh... I'd go with this one,

11:12.626 --> 11:15.288
Internal Research Memos
from Barnes AgroChemical.

11:15.313 --> 11:17.157
Yeah, their CEO is a total sleazebag.

11:17.196 --> 11:20.132
He supposedly buried studies
that his products cause cancer.

11:20.157 --> 11:22.116
All right, Patterson. Do your thing.

11:22.141 --> 11:24.101
Okay, hold on. It's not that easy.

11:24.103 --> 11:26.625
There's a reason that
they chose these documents.

11:26.650 --> 11:29.117
Remote access would take me a day.

11:29.142 --> 11:32.165
"We don't have that kind
of time, Patterson." I know.

11:32.190 --> 11:35.751
The only shortcut would be to
have the CEO's system password.

11:35.776 --> 11:38.515
Okay. So how do we get that?

11:38.680 --> 11:42.469
Anyone up for a nice, quiet
stroll through Park Slope?

11:47.872 --> 11:49.505
What?

11:49.530 --> 11:50.996
Nothing.

11:50.999 --> 11:54.167
It's just, it's not our
typical day at the office.

11:54.168 --> 11:55.800
Why?

11:55.802 --> 11:58.251
'Cause we're not getting shot at?

11:58.276 --> 12:00.517
It's just a nice change of pace is all.

12:03.751 --> 12:06.423
It's just... you know, normal.

12:06.448 --> 12:08.857
I don't know. I guess
normal ain't so bad.

12:12.441 --> 12:15.009
So have you heard from Nas today?

12:15.820 --> 12:17.820
She's keeping her distance.

12:17.822 --> 12:19.755
Laying low for a while.

12:20.276 --> 12:22.543
How do you feel about her leaving?

12:22.720 --> 12:25.696
We just have to finish what she started.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.656
Uh, no, I meant... I mean, like,

12:28.681 --> 12:31.179
with Allie in Colorado, I just...

12:31.204 --> 12:34.154
I just want to make sure that you're...

12:34.922 --> 12:36.712
I'll be fine.

12:38.427 --> 12:40.094
That's it.

12:56.291 --> 12:57.657
Step one complete.

12:57.659 --> 12:59.726
Okay, get into place for step two.

13:07.643 --> 13:09.344
Damn it!

13:11.070 --> 13:12.734
Need a ride?

13:13.742 --> 13:16.708
I'm late to a meeting, so don't
get cute with the yellow lights.

13:17.173 --> 13:18.508
Yes, sir.

13:21.192 --> 13:24.128
- Jerry Barnes.
- Mr. Barnes, this is Gloria from IT.

13:24.153 --> 13:26.261
- Yeah?
- Someone has your login info.

13:26.287 --> 13:27.950
They're trying to
break into your account.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.301
- Who?
- Uh, we're not sure yet,

13:30.326 --> 13:32.449
but I'm gonna need to access
your account, dig a little deeper.

13:32.474 --> 13:34.433
I'm gonna need your password first.

13:34.458 --> 13:36.709
Are you serious?

13:36.734 --> 13:40.194
I know what a phishing
scam is, lady, go to hell.

13:41.827 --> 13:43.855
IT, this is Cheri. How can I help you?

13:43.857 --> 13:45.195
This is Jerry Barnes.

13:45.220 --> 13:46.925
I just got a phishing call.
Someone's trying to hack me.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.094
Oh, that doesn't sound
good at all, Mr. Barnes.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.648
I'm so glad you called us.

13:50.673 --> 13:52.935
Has the server shown any
unusual connection attempts?

13:52.960 --> 13:53.999
I'm not seeing anything,

13:54.001 --> 13:55.867
but you should log in
and check your own device.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.077
Would you like me to hold the...

14:00.302 --> 14:02.588
This program uses
spatio-temporal dynamics

14:02.613 --> 14:03.963
to analyze his keystrokes.

14:03.988 --> 14:05.382
That's like reading lips for thumbs.

14:05.407 --> 14:06.958
Amazing.

14:11.490 --> 14:14.191
- You can't trust anyone these days.
- You said it, pal.

14:14.216 --> 14:16.817
That's why I keep all my
money under the mattress.

14:18.553 --> 14:21.354
I just sent the hacked
memos to the Garens.

14:21.356 --> 14:22.872
Now all we have to do is wait.

14:22.897 --> 14:25.564
All right, let me know the
second you hear anything.

14:31.039 --> 14:32.375
I quit.

14:33.359 --> 14:35.406
Let's talk in my office.

14:41.957 --> 14:43.820
I, uh...

14:45.194 --> 14:48.524
I want to apologize for
flying off the handle,

14:48.549 --> 14:50.416
throwing my badge down,

14:50.418 --> 14:52.217
messing up in the first place.

14:52.219 --> 14:53.899
It wasn't your finest hour.

14:53.924 --> 14:55.384
I was pissed off.

14:55.409 --> 14:57.989
At the world, at Zapata, at you.

14:58.015 --> 15:00.219
You still pissed off?

15:00.244 --> 15:02.077
I'm ready not to be.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.641
I can't just hand back your badge.

15:04.666 --> 15:07.071
I know. Um...

15:08.986 --> 15:10.492
I was hoping I could take you up

15:10.517 --> 15:12.836
on that offer to take
a leave of absence.

15:13.391 --> 15:15.539
If I give you the time,

15:16.220 --> 15:18.389
I need you to put everything into it.

15:18.415 --> 15:20.982
Clean up. See Dr. Sun.

15:20.984 --> 15:22.917
Hit the gym. Hit the range.

15:22.918 --> 15:25.340
- Get back to field shape.
- I will.

15:25.365 --> 15:27.388
I never reported you up the chain.

15:27.390 --> 15:29.390
If you come back a hundred percent,

15:29.392 --> 15:31.623
as far as I'm concerned,

15:32.226 --> 15:34.094
I never have to.

15:34.096 --> 15:35.663
Thank you.

15:35.665 --> 15:38.787
- I won't let you down.
- I know you won't.

15:41.604 --> 15:43.137
Hey.

15:43.139 --> 15:44.838
How'd it go with Weller?

15:44.840 --> 15:46.440
He's gonna give me some time.

15:46.442 --> 15:48.107
What about you?

15:48.143 --> 15:49.834
Last night was...

15:53.613 --> 15:55.292
Yeah.

15:56.502 --> 15:59.025
Thanks for being there for me.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.550
Not a lot of people would
have sat through that.

16:01.575 --> 16:04.525
Reade... I'm so sorry.

16:04.791 --> 16:07.649
Hey, at least I'm not in limbo anymore.

16:07.674 --> 16:10.007
I know what happened
to me, I can own it...

16:10.009 --> 16:12.085
and begin to move forward.

16:22.675 --> 16:25.219
- Still no word back from the Garens?
- Radio silence.

16:25.244 --> 16:26.516
Look, any chance they figured out

16:26.541 --> 16:28.047
the documents came from law enforcement?

16:28.072 --> 16:30.610
Zero. I sent them via Tor network

16:30.635 --> 16:33.433
after using multiple VPNs,
spoofed the IP address...

16:33.458 --> 16:35.404
Maybe somebody beat us to it.

16:36.623 --> 16:38.769
Wait, wait, wait. Here we go.

16:41.363 --> 16:43.946
"You've come this far,
now don't become a bust.

16:43.948 --> 16:46.815
"Come here, wear red and
bring someone you trust."

16:46.817 --> 16:48.605
These are coordinates for
an intersection in Queens.

16:48.630 --> 16:50.018
Okay, this is getting ridiculous.

16:50.020 --> 16:51.433
At best, we're wasting our time.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.043
At worst, we're walking into a trap.

16:53.068 --> 16:56.744
Or it's our last chance to get
thousands of highly classified documents

16:56.769 --> 16:59.269
off the market, before
they land in enemy hands.

16:59.294 --> 17:01.519
Yeah, not to mention
find the Truman Protocol.

17:01.544 --> 17:03.599
Look, I'm just as fed up
with this stunt as you are,

17:03.601 --> 17:05.133
but we have to keep pursuing it.

17:05.135 --> 17:07.950
Two people are invited,
so Jane and I will go.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.136
Wait. No, no, no. I should be there.

17:11.137 --> 17:12.871
What if they have you do

17:12.873 --> 17:15.874
more programming challenges, puzzles?

17:15.876 --> 17:17.715
I'm great at puzzles.

17:20.994 --> 17:23.188
Uh, yes...

17:23.213 --> 17:25.113
in your own way.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.386
Look, we don't know how dangerous

17:28.411 --> 17:30.457
this meet is going to be, so...

17:30.482 --> 17:32.969
Tasha, you run point on the
surveillance side of things,

17:32.971 --> 17:36.940
and Jane, it says that we
have to wear red, so, um...

17:36.942 --> 17:40.019
Let's go find you something hacker chic.

17:40.987 --> 17:43.111
I feel ridiculous.

17:43.370 --> 17:46.316
I don't know. This could
be a new look for you.

17:46.341 --> 17:48.792
I'm gonna burn these clothes
as soon as we get back.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.985
We shouldn't have let
them go in like this.

17:53.010 --> 17:54.745
Unarmed, no comms.

17:54.747 --> 17:57.394
It's too risky. We don't know
if they're gonna get swept.

17:58.643 --> 18:00.128
Jane.

18:02.653 --> 18:04.011
Follow me.

18:06.355 --> 18:08.480
They're moving. Let's go.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.256
We gotta get closer.

18:22.336 --> 18:24.503
- Do you see them?
- No.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.672
Got 'em.

18:49.623 --> 18:51.123
They're gone.

18:57.031 --> 18:58.054
All right.

18:58.079 --> 18:59.866
I pulled the ATM and traffic cams.

18:59.868 --> 19:01.267
Here's our mystery men.

19:01.269 --> 19:02.702
No hits on facial rec.

19:02.704 --> 19:04.046
Of course, 'cause that
would actually be helpful.

19:04.071 --> 19:05.770
Looks like Jane and
Weller stayed with the mob

19:05.795 --> 19:08.084
for a few blocks, then
everyone gets into these vans.

19:08.109 --> 19:10.376
Impossible to tell which
one Jane and Weller get into.

19:10.378 --> 19:12.445
Okay. Keep mining the cameras.

19:12.447 --> 19:14.312
I'll put BOLOs out on the vans.

19:19.312 --> 19:20.631
What is this place?

19:20.656 --> 19:22.422
I think it's an old sanatorium
where they used to keep

19:22.424 --> 19:24.677
tuberculosis patients in the 1900s.

19:24.702 --> 19:26.036
Sounds cozy.

19:26.061 --> 19:27.460
Yeah.

19:30.802 --> 19:33.166
"The simplest answer gets
you through this door.

19:33.168 --> 19:35.768
"Be smart, you only get one try.

19:35.770 --> 19:37.453
"No more."

19:37.478 --> 19:39.434
It's a math problem.

19:41.976 --> 19:45.078
"If two boings plus
four flarps equals six,

19:45.080 --> 19:48.506
"and six boings plus
eight flarps equals ten,

19:48.531 --> 19:51.918
"what is the square root
of boing over flarp?"

19:52.852 --> 19:55.639
It'd be really nice to
have Patterson right now.

19:55.664 --> 19:57.899
- I know.
- Maybe we should just guess.

19:57.924 --> 19:59.791
Wait. Jane.

20:05.666 --> 20:08.514
"The simplest answer gets
you through the door."

20:08.539 --> 20:09.930
See?

20:10.305 --> 20:12.315
Told you I was great at puzzles.

20:19.314 --> 20:20.980
Whoa.

20:20.982 --> 20:24.200
At least we weren't
on the turquoise team.

20:25.309 --> 20:28.287
I don't suppose we could
just shove the Garen brothers

20:28.289 --> 20:30.323
in a closet and steal the documents.

20:30.325 --> 20:32.847
Somehow, I don't think
their armed guards

20:32.872 --> 20:34.827
would be too thrilled by that.

20:34.829 --> 20:36.863
We don't even know what
the Garens look like.

20:36.865 --> 20:38.397
They could be in this room

20:38.422 --> 20:41.090
or they could be a thousand miles away.

20:43.304 --> 20:46.395
You think all these people
in this room are hackers?

20:47.527 --> 20:49.026
Most of them.

20:49.051 --> 20:52.545
Some are probably
mercenaries, enemy spies.

20:52.547 --> 20:54.347
There's a long list of people

20:54.349 --> 20:57.653
that are after these documents
for the wrong reasons.

20:57.986 --> 20:59.352
I don't know.

20:59.354 --> 21:01.721
I just... I don't get it.

21:01.723 --> 21:03.489
If the Garens wanted to retire,

21:03.491 --> 21:05.525
why not just sell to the highest bidder?

21:05.527 --> 21:07.994
Why this insane scavenger hunt?

21:07.996 --> 21:10.786
The same reason they're
after these documents.

21:10.843 --> 21:12.275
Power.

21:30.495 --> 21:33.252
What? A lady hacker?

21:33.254 --> 21:35.354
Every federale on the planet

21:35.379 --> 21:38.951
has two men on their most wanted list.

21:38.976 --> 21:41.444
Talk about unconscious bias.

21:41.469 --> 21:44.440
The future is female,
am I right, Hot Topic?

21:45.648 --> 21:49.476
I'm Kiva Garen, co-founder of Leakhub.

21:49.859 --> 21:51.637
Now, who wants to meet my sister?

21:51.639 --> 21:53.639
Come on, show of hands.

21:53.641 --> 21:55.474
How about you, glasses?

21:55.953 --> 21:57.810
Well, you can't meet her. She's dead.

21:57.812 --> 22:00.613
Thanks for bringing
up that painful memory.

22:00.615 --> 22:03.983
She was killed in a
boat crash last month.

22:03.985 --> 22:07.026
Some spook after our document cache.

22:07.051 --> 22:09.385
Now that she's gone,

22:09.410 --> 22:11.271
I want out.

22:11.296 --> 22:12.792
Whoever's gonna run this thing

22:12.794 --> 22:14.427
has to be able to think creatively,

22:14.429 --> 22:17.997
crack codes and stand
up in the face of danger.

22:17.999 --> 22:19.832
Two of you are about to walk away

22:19.834 --> 22:24.044
with the world's most
valuable classified documents.

22:24.069 --> 22:27.648
But first, someone in here is lying...

22:27.673 --> 22:29.718
about who they are.

22:32.266 --> 22:34.163
One of you is a cop.

22:44.585 --> 22:46.140
_

22:47.069 --> 22:49.670
Those things baffle me.

22:49.695 --> 22:53.318
The smarter they get, the dumber I feel.

22:57.820 --> 23:00.114
He's your father, isn't he?

23:00.139 --> 23:04.192
The captain who ordered you
to work the overnight shift?

23:04.217 --> 23:06.795
I can see the family resemblance.

23:06.820 --> 23:09.342
He's a real charmer.

23:11.494 --> 23:14.595
Tough house to grow up in, I'm guessing.

23:16.631 --> 23:18.762
Your father knows.

23:18.787 --> 23:20.688
He knows he's a tyrant.

23:20.690 --> 23:23.090
He knows you hate him.

23:23.092 --> 23:27.029
It's the first thing he
thinks of every morning

23:27.764 --> 23:30.772
and the last thing
before he goes to sleep.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.826
I don't hate my father.

23:36.013 --> 23:38.153
I just miss him.

23:40.705 --> 23:42.572
And one of you has the audacity to think

23:42.597 --> 23:45.769
I'd fall for a spoofed IP address.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.076
What about you?

23:50.078 --> 23:52.338
Who do you think the cop is?

23:52.363 --> 23:53.683
I wouldn't know.

23:53.708 --> 23:55.980
Aw, come on, take your best guess.

23:59.154 --> 24:00.769
What about her?

24:00.794 --> 24:02.227
I think it's her.

24:02.252 --> 24:04.185
We've been blindly following
you through this maze

24:04.210 --> 24:05.759
and now you're threatening us?

24:05.761 --> 24:07.675
Enough is enough.

24:07.700 --> 24:10.038
You know, you're
right. Enough is enough.

24:13.467 --> 24:15.264
Relax.

24:15.289 --> 24:16.903
I already knew she was MI5.

24:16.928 --> 24:19.306
I just had to make sure
nobody else was a narc, too.

24:19.308 --> 24:22.509
So does anybody have anything
they'd like to confess?

24:24.646 --> 24:27.213
Very good. Moving on...

24:32.063 --> 24:33.897
Get out, it's a trap!

24:38.004 --> 24:39.869
No, no, no, I'm not... I'm not a cop...

24:53.739 --> 24:56.087
The doors to your rooms will unlock

24:56.089 --> 24:57.955
once you complete the final challenge,

24:57.957 --> 25:00.896
and the first ones to meet
me in the boiler room...

25:00.921 --> 25:03.371
get this.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.897
The world's most sought-after documents.

25:05.899 --> 25:09.083
The treasure chest you all came for.

25:09.254 --> 25:11.214
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

25:11.239 --> 25:12.470
Especially you two.

25:12.472 --> 25:15.098
I don't have good feelings about you.

25:24.255 --> 25:25.819
"Prove you can trust each other

25:25.821 --> 25:29.456
"and you'll find your fates
will be forever intertwined."

25:30.528 --> 25:32.417
This woman is exhausting.

25:32.442 --> 25:35.229
She seriously wants us
to take polygraph tests?

25:35.254 --> 25:37.669
Well, we have no reason to lie, right?

25:46.275 --> 25:48.814
Leakhub is built on the idea

25:48.839 --> 25:51.111
of complete transparency.

25:51.113 --> 25:53.280
I need to be sure I can trust you

25:53.282 --> 25:55.628
and that you trust each other.

25:57.245 --> 25:59.729
How long are you gonna keep us here?

25:59.754 --> 26:01.735
What? I... I can't hear you.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.643
- How much longer...
- I'm messing with you.

26:03.668 --> 26:05.549
This is all pre-recorded.

26:05.574 --> 26:07.557
None of you had answering machines?

26:07.643 --> 26:09.743
Okay, first question.

26:09.784 --> 26:11.498
How did you meet your partner

26:11.500 --> 26:13.877
and what was your first impression?

26:16.572 --> 26:19.987
We met while we were in
the same holding cell.

26:20.463 --> 26:23.064
And my impression?

26:23.089 --> 26:24.655
I was terrified.

26:29.417 --> 26:30.690
_

26:33.856 --> 26:36.356
NYPD picked up a few
participants from the flash mob.

26:36.358 --> 26:38.225
- And?
- They all have the same story,

26:38.227 --> 26:40.928
saw a post on Craigslist
announcing a flash mob,

26:40.930 --> 26:42.821
- never met the organizers.
- Can you trace the posts?

26:42.846 --> 26:45.157
Negative. Dead end.

26:45.182 --> 26:47.430
- Something from Jane and Weller.
- No.

26:47.455 --> 26:49.622
Remember Sandstorm's document forger?

26:49.647 --> 26:51.480
The one Cade gave us.

26:51.505 --> 26:54.676
My text just recovered something
off one of his hard drives.

26:54.701 --> 26:57.835
A request from this month
for a bunch of fake passports.

26:57.837 --> 27:00.566
These are probably
aliases, but they're fresh.

27:00.591 --> 27:02.668
Some of these could
lead us to Sandstorm.

27:02.693 --> 27:04.108
Wait!

27:04.110 --> 27:06.043
Wait, one of these names just
went through customs in Bangkok.

27:06.045 --> 27:08.045
Kerry Coleman.

27:10.857 --> 27:13.222
Shepherd's in Bangkok right now.

27:13.247 --> 27:15.188
Yes, I've lied to my partner,

27:15.213 --> 27:18.013
and yes, it was about
something important.

27:19.662 --> 27:20.935
_

27:22.224 --> 27:23.699
Next question.

27:23.724 --> 27:27.012
What's the best thing your
partner's ever done for you

27:27.037 --> 27:28.973
and what's the worst?

27:28.998 --> 27:31.666
And, yes, I got most of these questions

27:31.668 --> 27:35.202
from a "Do You Know Your
Partner" quiz in O Magazine.

27:36.318 --> 27:39.701
I used to put a lot of walls up.

27:39.810 --> 27:43.611
She somehow found a
way to get inside them.

27:44.646 --> 27:46.466
Worst thing...

27:47.264 --> 27:49.098
same answer.

27:51.647 --> 27:52.991
_

27:53.513 --> 27:54.956
Last question.

27:54.958 --> 27:57.792
Why did you choose to
work with your partner

27:57.794 --> 28:00.695
and why did they
choose to work with you?

28:01.076 --> 28:02.638
I chose to work with my partner

28:02.663 --> 28:06.233
because he was... honest,

28:06.235 --> 28:10.404
loyal, and I trusted him with my life.

28:10.974 --> 28:13.074
As for him, uh,

28:13.076 --> 28:16.029
he didn't choose to work
with me, he was forced to.

28:16.712 --> 28:18.212
_

28:19.315 --> 28:21.360
Another challenge?

28:27.256 --> 28:29.697
Four locks. So that means...

28:29.722 --> 28:31.659
there's four keys hidden
in this room somewhere.

28:31.661 --> 28:33.728
Find these keys. Let's hurry.

28:42.105 --> 28:43.984
That's one. Nice work.

28:54.684 --> 28:57.084
"And every night about midnight."

28:57.674 --> 28:59.353
Weller, the clock.

28:59.355 --> 29:01.073
Turn the hands to midnight.

29:04.131 --> 29:05.479
Makes two.

29:16.706 --> 29:18.349
That makes three.

29:26.816 --> 29:28.549
I got one left.

29:28.551 --> 29:30.284
This one's got a round keyhole.

29:30.309 --> 29:32.489
Try the shackle in the last padlock.

29:34.103 --> 29:35.817
- That?
- Yeah.

29:40.831 --> 29:42.231
Weller.

29:42.256 --> 29:44.410
It's the room next door.

29:48.262 --> 29:51.082
"That button leads you
out, but watch the glass.

29:51.107 --> 29:54.539
"You'll fill the other
room with lethal gas."

29:54.564 --> 29:57.132
She can't mean that literally, can she?

29:57.157 --> 29:59.390
Unfortunately, I think she does.

29:59.415 --> 30:01.582
The only way she's gonna
let us out of this room

30:01.584 --> 30:03.446
is if we kill those two.

30:17.840 --> 30:21.144
Any chance of getting
that glass of water?

30:38.059 --> 30:39.614
_

30:39.639 --> 30:40.849
_

30:45.972 --> 30:48.394
Who was the tyrant?

30:48.542 --> 30:52.465
You were speaking from
experience earlier, no?

30:53.138 --> 30:56.832
Was your father the tyrant, or you?

30:57.825 --> 30:59.847
Both, actually.

30:59.849 --> 31:01.512
Hm.

31:03.687 --> 31:06.020
What is your kid's name?

31:06.045 --> 31:09.464
I have two. Remy and Roman.

31:09.489 --> 31:13.754
I think Remy and Roman miss you, too.

31:14.394 --> 31:15.871
Yeah.

31:17.225 --> 31:18.707
Maybe.

31:25.415 --> 31:27.927
I'm going to have a smoke.

32:13.288 --> 32:16.157
These vents are designed to
pump the gas in then seal it.

32:16.159 --> 32:18.148
Okay, we have to find another way out.

32:18.173 --> 32:20.382
There's got to be another key.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.507
Weller. They just finished the test.

32:24.955 --> 32:26.855
Don't! Don't!

32:29.128 --> 32:30.715
It was a trick.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.320
She's letting us out for
not pressing the button.

32:32.345 --> 32:34.745
No, no, no. We can't
let 'em die like that.

32:44.821 --> 32:46.461
Jane!

33:17.277 --> 33:20.651
Ooh! Oh, you missed it by that much.

33:22.042 --> 33:24.494
Meet Linnea, my sister.

33:24.519 --> 33:26.761
I thought you said she
died in a boat crash.

33:26.763 --> 33:29.363
Then she must be a ghost!

33:31.011 --> 33:33.901
Running this site has
become a massive drag.

33:33.903 --> 33:36.070
Governments are feeding us fake stuff

33:36.072 --> 33:37.572
to influence other governments.

33:37.574 --> 33:40.475
It all just requires
so much vetting now.

33:40.477 --> 33:42.315
It's no fun.

33:42.612 --> 33:46.503
And we wanted out, so this
seemed like the best solution.

33:46.528 --> 33:49.818
Yeah, but you said the first
ones that meet you here win.

33:49.819 --> 33:51.376
Where is his partner?

33:51.401 --> 33:53.347
Uh, technically speaking,

33:53.372 --> 33:55.805
according to rule six, subsection B...

33:55.830 --> 33:58.073
Nobody likes a sore loser.

33:58.098 --> 34:02.240
Okay, so this hard drive has
our whole document cache on it

34:02.265 --> 34:04.532
and this is the password.

34:04.534 --> 34:06.033
Hang on, hang on.

34:06.035 --> 34:08.697
That last test, the red button,

34:08.722 --> 34:11.563
That was to make sure your site

34:11.589 --> 34:14.475
went to someone with
a moral code, right?

34:14.476 --> 34:16.377
Now who's reading O Magazine?

34:16.379 --> 34:18.179
Okay, what's your point?

34:18.181 --> 34:21.349
You unlocked the doors and
this guy and his partner,

34:21.351 --> 34:23.384
he ran straight for the finish

34:23.386 --> 34:27.237
and we stayed back to save
the lives of two strangers.

34:27.263 --> 34:29.197
That's got to be worth something.

34:33.426 --> 34:35.059
Fair point.

34:36.362 --> 34:39.072
And I do love a twist ending.

34:39.098 --> 34:40.542
What the hell?

34:42.842 --> 34:44.775
I said nobody likes a sore loser.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.699
Pay attention.

34:46.725 --> 34:49.353
These documents, they make you a target,

34:49.379 --> 34:51.533
so take them somewhere safe.

34:51.558 --> 34:55.672
And remember, a wise woman once said,

34:55.697 --> 34:58.933
"Your fates will be
forever intertwined."

35:01.059 --> 35:04.573
I said that. I'm... I'm the wise woman.

35:08.798 --> 35:10.064
Hey.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.332
Jane and Weller just made
contact. They're safe.

35:12.357 --> 35:13.870
Thank God. Did they get the documents?

35:13.895 --> 35:16.205
They're en route with
the files as we speak.

35:16.230 --> 35:17.738
Sorry, I have to take this.

35:17.763 --> 35:19.369
Just let me know when
they're in the building.

35:19.394 --> 35:21.082
- Yeah, you got it.
- Josh, kind of a busy day.

35:21.107 --> 35:23.464
- Can I call you back?
- This will just take a second.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.761
Remember Yamada?

35:24.786 --> 35:26.947
The lead detective on the Jones murder?

35:26.972 --> 35:29.739
He's had a bug up his ass ever
since his suspect fled town.

35:29.764 --> 35:31.573
Yeah, that was forever ago. So?

35:31.598 --> 35:33.521
He's been digging around
the chain of custody

35:33.523 --> 35:35.089
on the murder weapon.

35:37.707 --> 35:40.995
He's talking about starting an
obstruction of justice investigation.

35:40.997 --> 35:42.371
Okay.

35:42.396 --> 35:43.636
You asked me to keep you in the loop,

35:43.661 --> 35:46.105
I figured I'd just make sure
you had your ducks in a row.

35:46.130 --> 35:48.130
I've got no ducks here, Josh.

35:48.155 --> 35:49.604
All the better.

36:55.520 --> 36:58.074
Watching that tape must have been awful.

36:58.589 --> 37:01.192
Yeah, it was, but...

37:01.848 --> 37:04.482
at least I can move on now, right?

37:04.507 --> 37:05.828
Okay.

37:05.830 --> 37:08.230
Do you think that's true?

37:08.232 --> 37:11.120
I went to the range today.

37:11.810 --> 37:15.042
And every time I fired
my weapon, I just...

37:15.206 --> 37:16.906
kept getting these flashes

37:16.908 --> 37:18.541
of everything I've been going through.

37:18.543 --> 37:21.877
Flashbacks are a normal reaction
to post-traumatic stress.

37:21.879 --> 37:24.251
Yeah, but I used to go into the field

37:24.276 --> 37:26.043
and feel completely in control.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.932
I used to trust my instincts,
I knew exactly who I was.

37:28.957 --> 37:31.625
Now, how do I get that back?

37:31.650 --> 37:35.378
There's no quick or absolute answers.

37:36.219 --> 37:39.119
But if you're finding that you're...

37:39.144 --> 37:41.278
reacting negatively to certain stimuli,

37:41.280 --> 37:42.784
then perhaps it's necessary

37:42.809 --> 37:44.970
to remove yourself from those triggers.

37:44.995 --> 37:46.817
I'm an FBI agent.

37:46.819 --> 37:48.451
You want me to stay away from guns?

37:48.453 --> 37:51.190
Maybe you're in the wrong line of work.

37:53.759 --> 37:55.339
You're serious.

37:55.364 --> 37:58.831
I'd suggest nothing should be
off the table at this point.

38:01.266 --> 38:03.600
She had a 100-digit password.

38:03.602 --> 38:05.268
Nine would have taken a decade to crack,

38:05.270 --> 38:07.163
but sure, err on the side of caution.

38:09.441 --> 38:11.741
Whoa. This is...

38:11.743 --> 38:14.644
This has the mental health
records of the entire Cabinet.

38:14.646 --> 38:17.273
Here's a list of all the double
agents inside the German government.

38:17.298 --> 38:20.179
And the security protocol for
all of our embassies abroad.

38:20.742 --> 38:22.651
If this would have gotten
into the wrong hands...

38:22.676 --> 38:24.421
Have you found the Truman Protocol yet?

38:24.423 --> 38:26.423
Uh...

38:26.425 --> 38:27.958
Here it is.

38:29.431 --> 38:30.930
That's Harry Truman's signature.

38:30.955 --> 38:33.723
And Eisenhower, and
every president since.

38:33.748 --> 38:35.932
So the only thing that we
know about the Truman Protocol,

38:35.934 --> 38:38.101
it goes to the highest
levels of the government.

38:38.103 --> 38:39.864
And whatever is behind those redactions

38:39.889 --> 38:41.981
is too classified for
even the Garens to uncover.

38:42.006 --> 38:43.770
Look at the bottom.

38:45.544 --> 38:48.812
My source at Sandstorm
told me to follow the cogs,

38:48.814 --> 38:51.281
that that would lead to the
answer behind everything.

38:51.283 --> 38:53.383
Cade told Nas to follow the cogs.

38:53.385 --> 38:55.518
So that somehow connects
to the Truman Protocol.

38:55.520 --> 38:57.939
And that all connects to phase two.

38:57.964 --> 39:00.181
Now we just have to find out how.

39:06.398 --> 39:08.245
We are getting close.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.290
Today was a win, no
matter how you look at it.

39:12.315 --> 39:15.405
Well, it was a big part
of the puzzle. I just...

39:15.407 --> 39:17.776
I can't figure out how
it all fits together yet.

39:17.801 --> 39:19.509
Do you know what gives me more clarity?

39:19.511 --> 39:21.678
- What?
- More alcohol.

39:23.649 --> 39:25.081
You know, she's right.

39:25.083 --> 39:27.175
Maybe round three is the charm. Come on.

39:36.328 --> 39:38.812
I was never forced to work with you.

39:38.977 --> 39:41.054
On the polygraph,

39:41.079 --> 39:44.273
you said that I was
forced to work with you.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.672
You never refused to let me
in the field multiple times?

39:49.890 --> 39:51.186
Doesn't sound like me.

39:51.211 --> 39:53.422
- Mm-hmm.
- No...

39:53.890 --> 39:56.947
Well, anyway, that's...
that's not what I meant.

39:57.461 --> 40:00.090
We're only here because
Shepherd wanted us here.

40:00.115 --> 40:01.615
Maybe.

40:02.398 --> 40:04.120
That's okay.

40:04.656 --> 40:06.359
We're doing a lot of good here.

40:06.384 --> 40:08.023
Saving a lot of lives.

40:08.048 --> 40:09.703
Yeah.

40:09.728 --> 40:11.187
And...

40:14.100 --> 40:15.366
What?

40:15.391 --> 40:16.710
All of this.

40:18.161 --> 40:20.007
That led me to you.

40:21.621 --> 40:23.736
And you to me.

40:25.264 --> 40:27.400
And that is something...

40:27.970 --> 40:31.438
that I would never want to undo.

40:39.147 --> 40:40.806
Here we go.

40:40.831 --> 40:42.742
- Round three.
- Yeah.

40:42.767 --> 40:44.877
The one with all the answers.

40:44.902 --> 40:46.401
Awesome.

40:47.205 --> 40:49.372
All of the answers we need.

40:49.374 --> 40:51.273
All right.

40:52.009 --> 40:54.810
Yes, I got out. How else do
you think I'm calling you?

40:54.812 --> 40:57.253
- What about the material.
- It's with me.

40:57.278 --> 40:59.173
We're still on schedule,

40:59.198 --> 41:01.601
but we can't afford any more problems.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.116
About that.

41:03.118 --> 41:05.418
It looks like the FBI may
have the Truman Protocol.

41:05.420 --> 41:07.461
What? How?

41:07.486 --> 41:09.122
It's, um...

41:09.124 --> 41:10.743
It's a long story.

41:10.768 --> 41:12.067
Summarize.

41:12.092 --> 41:13.693
It landed on the open market.

41:13.695 --> 41:15.961
- The whole thing?
- We aren't sure.

41:15.986 --> 41:17.263
We didn't want to take any risks.

41:17.265 --> 41:19.797
We sent a team to stop
Weller from getting it, but...

41:19.822 --> 41:21.534
they didn't succeed.

41:21.536 --> 41:24.275
He's too dangerous now.
We need to take him out.

41:24.300 --> 41:25.766
I thought he was a
key piece of the plan.

41:25.791 --> 41:27.250
The plan needs to change.

41:27.275 --> 41:28.841
He's getting too close,

41:28.866 --> 41:30.603
becoming a liability.

41:31.111 --> 41:33.369
Kurt Weller needs to die.

41:33.394 --> 41:34.986
Consider it done.

41:48.267 --> 41:49.627
That's her.

41:50.853 --> 41:52.892
On your knees, now!

41:52.917 --> 41:54.626
You're under arrest.
