00:05.800 --> 00:07.500
Do you need any help
getting that to the table?

00:07.540 --> 00:10.200
I have an extremely high
metabolism rate.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.500
That'd be my guess.

00:11.540 --> 00:13.260
It was worse
when I was growing up.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.360
Every morning for breakfast
mama had to fix me a few dozen eggs

00:16.400 --> 00:18.100
and a couple of pounds of bacon.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.000
My whole family lived
in constant fear.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.500
 -Of what?
-Grease fire.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.200
Don't take that pudding!

00:28.240 --> 00:29.700
Carla, there's plenty more.

00:29.740 --> 00:31.300
No, I mean, don't buy it.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.900
I got an extra.
You can have it.

00:34.940 --> 00:37.100
You got an extra bread pudding?

00:37.140 --> 00:38.700
I bought two.

00:38.740 --> 00:41.200
I guess my eyes
are bigger than my…

00:41.240 --> 00:43.300
Why don't you let me feel
that part in?

00:43.340 --> 00:45.000
You're so clever.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.400
I guess I am.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.800
Bye. Thanks, Carla.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.800
-I payed for it.
-That's a switch.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.200
Why don't you let me feel
that part in?

00:59.240 --> 01:00.100
I beg your pardon?

01:00.140 --> 01:02.800
You're so clever.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.560
Something bugging you, Lana?

01:04.599 --> 01:06.600
Harry, how can you take pudding
from a hooker?

01:08.800 --> 01:12.400
I never thought anyone
would ask me that question.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.600
You're a judge.
It's improper.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.700
Oh, come on.

01:16.740 --> 01:20.160
She's been in our court
every day this week
and she's not even on the docket?

01:20.200 --> 01:21.300
So?

01:21.340 --> 01:25.200
And you know, there's been a fresh rose
every night on your bench too.

01:25.240 --> 01:26.900
I noticed, thanks.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.000
You thought I…

01:33.500 --> 01:35.900
Excuse me,
could you hurry it up?

01:35.940 --> 01:38.500
I don't want
my fish sticks to get cold.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.100
There's nothing on you plate.

01:42.140 --> 01:44.000
They're in my pocket.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.100
I couldn't take any chances.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.100
Hi, Dan.

01:55.140 --> 01:57.000
What's the matter with you?

01:57.040 --> 01:58.900
I'm depressed.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.300
International crisis threaten us
with the possibility of nuclear holocaust?

02:04.340 --> 02:09.699
And the increase in violent crime
has raised so one of us is going
to be murdered in sleep tonight.

02:09.739 --> 02:11.400
I don't wanna park him __

02:12.300 --> 02:13.400
Hi, gang.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.660
Dan, look at this.
You'll love this.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.660
Squirting flower.
Just 59 cents.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.700
I had it in a big sale
at the Novelty Shop.

02:21.740 --> 02:25.000
No, thanks.
I'd better get right down there.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.500
-Dan, you all right?
-He's got the blues.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.900
I don't get the blues.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.600
Jelly Roll Morton gets the blues.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.700
I get devastated.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.600
-The returns must be coming in now.
-Yes, they are.

02:40.900 --> 02:44.160
Oh, my god, I almost forgot
the special election is tonight.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.200
You're up for a city council seat.

02:46.800 --> 02:51.060
You're losing.
That's why you're depressed.

02:51.100 --> 02:54.500
Yes, I am losing
but that's not the depressing part.

02:54.540 --> 02:57.100
Didn't your opponent die
two weeks ago?

02:58.700 --> 03:01.500
That's the depressing part.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.760
How bad are you…?

03:06.800 --> 03:09.300
The body is ahead by 20%.

03:10.900 --> 03:11.960
Come on, Dan,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.760
you know how unsophisticated
the public is.

03:14.800 --> 03:18.100
They don't vote for issues,
they vote for personality.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.900
I've got to make a call.

03:29.100 --> 03:34.800
Remember when "alive"
was a good thing to be?

03:38.300 --> 03:40.800
I need a napkin.
Anybody need anything while I'm up?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.200
I'll be right back.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.160
Need a glass of water?

03:49.200 --> 03:51.400
No, thanks, Carla.
I just need a napkin.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.900
Here.
I've got condiments too.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.400
A napkin will do.
Thanks a lot.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.700
Your honor,

04:00.500 --> 04:04.900
I just want to say that
since I started being brought up
in front of you,

04:04.940 --> 04:09.100
I have developed a tremendous respect
for our justice system.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.100
A very healthy respect.

04:12.140 --> 04:13.600
I sense that.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.500
I have a great deal of respect
for you too.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.800
I guess I've always been attracted
to a man in a robe.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.000
That's a fairly common phenomenon.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.600
-Enjoy your pudding.
-I'm looking forward to it.

04:29.700 --> 04:34.600
Excuse me,
do you happen to have a __ lasagna?

04:36.000 --> 04:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:17.400 --> 05:21.200
Ms. Williams,
do you have anything to say
on your defendant's behalf
before I pass __?

05:21.240 --> 05:24.100
Your honor,
although my client has pled guilty

05:24.140 --> 05:28.100
I sincerely hope you'll express
compassion for this pathetic

05:28.140 --> 05:32.800
miserable, wretched empty
shallow human being.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.300
__

05:35.500 --> 05:37.960
The bench is overwhelmed
with mercy.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.800
Let's make it 10 days,
suspended sentence,

05:40.840 --> 05:42.300
and let's take
a 10 minute recess.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.600
Your honor, thank you.

05:45.600 --> 05:50.000
Listen, I really appreciate
what you did for me.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.700
-And I'd like to thank you.
-Don't mention it.

05:52.740 --> 05:55.800
Shall we say
"over dinner"?

05:58.700 --> 05:59.900
What?

05:59.940 --> 06:02.700
Do you like seafood?

06:06.500 --> 06:09.300
-Your honor…
-"Harry", it's recess.

06:09.340 --> 06:14.400
Harry, I just wanted to say
that back there in the cafeteria

06:14.440 --> 06:15.900
maybe I got a little
off of the line.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.400
Don't worry about that.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.300
I mean, your personal life
is your personal life

06:20.340 --> 06:22.000
and I don't want
to interfere in that.

06:22.100 --> 06:25.300
It was just a friendly warning.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.400
Maybe I do get a little
overprotective at times.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.900
It's just that your position
is one of such honor.

06:32.940 --> 06:36.800
I feel that in some way
it's my responsibility.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.800
I just hope you understand.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.500
Thank you for listening.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.400
Judge…

06:51.000 --> 06:52.300
What's that?

06:52.340 --> 06:54.500
A green stick.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.200
I bought that champagne
and other stuff.

06:59.240 --> 07:02.500
Are we still having
that victory celebration
we planned for Dan?

07:02.540 --> 07:05.400
Sure. I think things will turn around
once all the returns are in.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.000
I bought white champagne.
Is that right?

07:10.800 --> 07:13.300
-Let's see. We're serving it with…
-Cheetos.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.400
Hello.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.300
Hello yourself.

07:23.000 --> 07:23.960
Got a sec?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.500
Sure. What can I do for you?

07:25.540 --> 07:27.400
That's what I was gonna ask you.

07:27.440 --> 07:28.800
I asked you first.

07:29.300 --> 07:34.900
Your honor, back in the cafeteria
I was trying to tell you something.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.760
-There's no need to.
-There's not?

07:38.800 --> 07:40.900
I think we both know
what's going on here.

07:40.940 --> 07:42.000
Then you feel it too?

07:42.040 --> 07:43.800
No. I didn't say "feel".

07:43.840 --> 07:45.200
I don't feel.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.760
I mean, I feel, but I don't feel
what you feel I feel.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.960
Do you know what I mean?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.660
No. But I just love hearing you
use that nonsense.

07:52.700 --> 07:55.900
-Papers. Sign them.
-Thank you.

07:55.940 --> 07:58.000
-We'll talk later.
-Great.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.900
I have to make some calls
so I'm gonna go in here

08:01.940 --> 08:04.200
since there is no phone out here.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.100
That's precious.

08:06.140 --> 08:07.400
Yeah.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.900
Bye.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.400
What a guy!

08:12.900 --> 08:14.700
What were you two
talking about?

08:15.400 --> 08:18.000
The judge and I were having
a personal discussion.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.800
How personal?

08:20.800 --> 08:22.800
What business is it of yours?

08:22.840 --> 08:24.500
You're right.

08:25.300 --> 08:29.560
It is none of my business but
if you want a little friendly advice

08:29.600 --> 08:32.799
forget it.
He's not your type.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
But I suppose
he's your type.

08:37.039 --> 08:39.860
He's a sensitive, intellectual
complex man.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.500
Eclectic in nature,
multidimensional in personality

08:42.539 --> 08:45.300
and frankly,

08:45.340 --> 08:48.500
he would need a woman
of similar qualities to stimulate him.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.080
Honey, I don't know
what those words mean

08:52.120 --> 08:55.200
but I do know what it takes
to please a man.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.900
Physical stimulation is not enough.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.600
I won't use gadgets.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.600
It's not what I meant.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.500
You see, dear,

09:10.540 --> 09:12.460
most psychologists
and experts agree

09:12.500 --> 09:15.800
the way a man and a woman
respond to each other is cerebral.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.800
What?

09:17.840 --> 09:21.700
The brain.
Sex takes place between the ears.

09:21.740 --> 09:23.800
You need a bond.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.300
You need a map.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.000
It's open. No need to break it down.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.660
-Judge Stone?
-Yeah, come on in.

09:40.700 --> 09:44.460
I was in session down the hall
Just thought I'd stop by and say hello.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.900
-Judge Robert T. Wheeler.
-Nice to meet you.

09:46.940 --> 09:48.360
Neat robe!

09:48.400 --> 09:49.160
I beg your pardon.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.900
How do you keep those little __
at the bottom from crinkling up?

09:56.800 --> 09:59.160
Some of the other judges and I
were talking

09:59.200 --> 10:01.800
and we just wanted you to know
we're available.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.700
You mean, for weddings and stuff?

10:03.740 --> 10:06.600
Weddings?
That's very amusing.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.400
So what do you mean "available"?

10:09.500 --> 10:13.460
We wanted you to know
that we were accessible

10:13.500 --> 10:16.600
if you have any questions,
need any advice.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.060
Thanks, great.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.300
-Can I get you a fresca?
-No, thank you.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.100
I love this stuff.
But it's a weird name, ain't it?

10:23.500 --> 10:28.300
You know what's even weirder?
I once knew a guy named "Fresca".

10:28.800 --> 10:30.800
I really don't have much time to…

10:31.000 --> 10:32.200
I'm sorry.
You were saying?

10:32.500 --> 10:37.960
I've heard a little about how you operate,
a bit too unconventional, some say.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.900
A bit of a __ perhaps.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.000
Thanks.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.460
Harry, if I may call you Harry.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.600
Sure, Bob.

10:48.500 --> 10:54.100
Judge Stone, we are entrusted
with a lot of responsibilities in our job

10:54.140 --> 10:56.600
and quite frankly,
a lot of power.

10:57.500 --> 11:02.800
We start making a lot of waves,
draw a lot of attention to ourselves.

11:07.300 --> 11:11.100
Before you know it,
some of that power could be taken away.

11:11.140 --> 11:12.500
Am I making myself clear?

11:12.540 --> 11:15.100
Don't rock the boat.
Is that it?

11:15.140 --> 11:20.500
Harry, don't misunderstand me.
We just think of ourselves as a paternity,

11:20.540 --> 11:24.300
a club if you will,
a very exclusive club,

11:24.340 --> 11:27.700
whose members care
about each other.

11:27.740 --> 11:32.000
Harry, we want you to be
a member of that club.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.600
I've got a lot of neat stuff
for the club house.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.900
Yes. Very good.

11:49.600 --> 11:53.200
I find the defendant guilty
and the fine will be 50 bucks.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.060
-Next case.
-That's it, your honor.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.300
That's a wrap!

12:05.200 --> 12:06.600
More returns?

12:07.500 --> 12:10.600
-I assume your opponent is still—
-Dead. Yeah.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.900
How is it going?

12:13.940 --> 12:16.100
The cadaver has opened up its lead.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.200
I'm sorry.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.800
I just hope there's no after-life
so he can't gloat.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.800
I'll keep a good thought.__

12:28.500 --> 12:30.560
Dan, I know you know

12:30.600 --> 12:33.460
but if it's of any consolation
I voted for you.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.360
Me too.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.200
We all voted for you,
didn't we?

12:37.240 --> 12:38.500
Absolutely.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.300
A secret ballot is our most treasured
right to __ us into the constitution.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.300
Who did you vote for?

12:59.340 --> 13:05.100
I mean, the right of privacy is a guarantee
to ensure an open and free election.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.800
Who did you vote for?

13:07.800 --> 13:13.600
We are indebted to our founding fathers
for creating and granting us this privilege.

13:13.640 --> 13:16.400
Whom did you vote for?

13:16.440 --> 13:19.500
I voted for the best man.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.200
I knew it.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.300
Come on, kids, it's party time.
The refreshments are this way.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.800
Judge Stone, so glad I caught you
before you left.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.900
We were going to listen to the returns
and have a drink.

13:36.940 --> 13:40.600
Oh, yes, Fielding.
Steve still bumping you?

13:43.400 --> 13:45.500
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

13:45.540 --> 13:48.000
-Would you join us, judge Wheeler?
-Just for a sec.

13:48.200 --> 13:53.200
I really came by to say that
if I came on a little strong earlier
I'd like to apologize.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.900
Forget it. We all come on a little strong
every once in a while.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.300
Surprise!

14:07.500 --> 14:09.200
What are these people doing here?

14:09.240 --> 14:10.700
What are you doing here?

14:10.740 --> 14:12.000
I was supposed to meet him here.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.800
There's been a misunderstanding.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.100
What is going on here?
Who is this woman?

14:16.140 --> 14:18.000
-You mean the hooker?
-Hooker?

14:18.900 --> 14:22.600
Yes. Hooker, prostitute, street walker,
whatever you wanna call it.

14:22.640 --> 14:23.800
Meretrix?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.200
Look it up.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.400
You lied to me.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.700
Carla, I didn't lie.
I never said a thing.

14:32.740 --> 14:34.400
You told me to meet you
in your office.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.200
You don't really think
he'd need a hooker in his office, do you?

14:38.240 --> 14:39.900
You wouldn't, would you?

14:40.800 --> 14:43.800
Is that it?
Everybody had their laughs?

14:43.840 --> 14:47.500
Everybody got a kick out of seeing a
little turd __ make a fool out of herself?

14:48.100 --> 14:49.100
Stay away from me.

14:49.140 --> 14:50.600
Come on, get dressed
and we'll talk.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.000
What's the matter?
Are you embarrassed?

14:53.040 --> 14:55.000
Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.100
Hi, everybody,
sorry I'm late.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.600
I threw my clothes
out the window.

15:02.100 --> 15:05.000
At most
I was expecting charades.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.800
Harry, do something.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.160
She's right, Stone.
This calls for positive action.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.500
What do you suggest?

15:12.540 --> 15:14.100
Take her.

15:14.140 --> 15:17.100
Anybody comes near me and I'll follow
my clothes down, understand?

15:17.140 --> 15:20.500
Sex body in judge's chambers
turns tragic.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.160
Great headline, huh?

15:22.200 --> 15:24.100
Makes me want to read further.

15:26.700 --> 15:30.300
Don't just stand around,
let's party.

15:30.340 --> 15:31.500
Bar is open.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.200
That's the spirit.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.400
Come on, people,
enjoy yourselves.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.600
Do you mind
if I make a phone call?

15:38.700 --> 15:40.700
Whatever turns you on, honey.

15:41.900 --> 15:45.500
Dan, how can you think of yourself
at a time like this?

15:46.100 --> 15:50.200
Because I have stood next to death
and people liked him better.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.800
Well, good luck, Stone.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.500
Nobody leaves or I'll jump.

15:56.540 --> 15:59.700
I'm not going to stand here
and be blackmailed by anyone.

15:59.740 --> 16:02.600
Get your pompous butt
back in here, Wheeler.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.100
Bull, if anyone tries to leave…

16:09.000 --> 16:10.600
Have a seat.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.400
Why don't I have a talk with her,
you know, woman to woman?

16:18.440 --> 16:19.500
That might help.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.700
All right, get down
off there.

16:23.740 --> 16:25.100
Nice start.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.800
Isn't that the little prude?

16:27.840 --> 16:29.300
I am not little.

16:30.900 --> 16:31.900
Or prude.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.600
You've made love
with a light on?

16:34.640 --> 16:36.100
Of course I have.

16:36.140 --> 16:38.500
A dimmer doesn't count.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.760
Carla, please,
come out of the window.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.860
I wonder
what it feels like to fly.

16:47.900 --> 16:48.960
You won't like it,
trust me.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
You get bugs in your eyes
and pigeons push you around.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.900
You're wasting our time
standing there, fooling around.

16:55.940 --> 16:59.500
Fooling around is preferable
to the alternative at this point.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.960
You aren't taking her seriously,
are you?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
He's right,
nobody takes me seriously.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.599
Maybe it's about time
they did.

17:08.599 --> 17:12.200
All right, Carla,
get the hell inside that window and do it now!

17:13.099 --> 17:14.400
Rough stuff, huh?

17:14.440 --> 17:18.200
I apologize and offer to talk.
What else can I do?

17:18.240 --> 17:21.800
For starters?
Give me a drink.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.598
It's a good idea.
Let's have a drink.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.200
You come over here,
we'll sit down and talk.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.800
-Here.
-Here.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.099
-Here.
-There.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.700
I'll get champagne,
don't go away.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.100
Operator, please. Keep trying.
There must be somebody there.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.800
Mr. Fielding
for city council headquarters.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.200
Yes, the joker who is losing
to the corpse.

17:47.700 --> 17:51.500
I'm sure he must be
a real nerd.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.300
Carla, listen to me.

17:55.800 --> 17:59.700
I am truly sorry if I said or did
anything to mislead you.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.500
You did plenty, all right.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.800
What did I do?

18:02.840 --> 18:04.200
What did you do?

18:04.240 --> 18:07.500
Every time I came to the court
you smiled at me.

18:07.540 --> 18:09.300
You treated me with respect.

18:09.340 --> 18:12.100
You were generally concerned
with my welfare.

18:12.140 --> 18:14.400
Damn it,
you were nice to me.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.600
For the most part
I'm nice to everybody.

18:17.800 --> 18:22.000
You just better get in your head
that everybody in this world
ain't used to being treated nice.

18:22.040 --> 18:25.900
And if they are treated nice
is because somebody wants something from them.

18:25.940 --> 18:30.000
So when somebody treats you nice
and they don't want anything from you,

18:30.040 --> 18:31.800
you think they love you.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.200
I thought you loved me.

18:35.100 --> 18:37.000
I know I love you.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.960
Come on, Stone,
this has gone on long enough.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.400
Take a look at her.
She's not going to jump.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.960
No, she never was.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.760
Then pull her down
and let's get out of here.

18:51.800 --> 18:55.400
She's just an emotionally mixed-up woman
who thought you were in love with her.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.600
Maybe she's right.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.900
I'm sorry.
What did he say?

19:01.500 --> 19:05.860
I said maybe she's right.
Maybe I am in love with her.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.600
Harry, what are you doing?

19:07.640 --> 19:09.900
Just trying to look at things
realistically.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.660
I did treat her nice.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.300
Maybe I treated her extra nice.
I don't know.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.000
Isn't that a thing
about her feelings?

19:17.040 --> 19:19.600
No, operator,
I don't mind.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.300
Sometimes you can't even make sense
out of your own.

19:25.340 --> 19:28.200
-Do you know what I mean?
-I do.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.200
Especially about love.

19:33.300 --> 19:36.200
When do you fall in love
with somebody?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.700
When do you think
you're in love with somebody?

19:39.740 --> 19:44.200
When do you start to love
and when is it complete?

19:44.800 --> 19:47.860
I don't know any more about love
than the next guy,

19:47.900 --> 19:49.800
I don't know
if anybody does.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.100
But I do know that if someone told me
that they loved you

19:55.600 --> 19:58.600
I wouldn't have to ask why.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.900
Your honor, I just…

20:20.800 --> 20:23.500
I always wanted to do that
to somebody.

20:24.500 --> 20:29.300
-Stone, mind if I go now?
-Not at all, judge Wheeler.

20:30.100 --> 20:34.360
About that club of yours,
I don't really think I'm interested.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.000
I mean, no secret handshakes
or anything.

20:38.040 --> 20:41.300
I'm not really sure you're fit
to wear that robe.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.300
I think you're right.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.600
Selma, you have a lady
in distress here.

20:53.640 --> 20:57.700
I've got some clothes in my locker
you can wear around the way home.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.200
What size are you?

20:59.240 --> 21:02.500
Seven. Extra shriveled.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.200
Listen, everybody,

21:08.700 --> 21:13.100
I want to apologize for acting
like a real fool.

21:13.700 --> 21:17.200
Forget it.
It could have happened to any of us.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.400
Well, most any of us.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.300
Judge Stone,

21:24.100 --> 21:26.500
thanks for the dignity.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.100
Thanks for the pudding.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.700
All the press __ have now reported in
and it's official.

21:39.740 --> 21:44.600
The 13th district city council seat
has been won by the late Edward Burns.

21:45.300 --> 21:48.500
Burns, who would have been 52
next January

21:48.540 --> 21:53.600
pulled up a stunning upset
in what many insiders felt
was a sure bet for the live candidate.

21:53.640 --> 21:57.000
That candidate,
assistant district attorney Dan Fielding…

21:59.700 --> 22:00.860
Sorry, Dan.

22:00.900 --> 22:02.760
So am I, Dan.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.800
I really am.

22:09.100 --> 22:13.500
I think this just goes to show you
how really uninformed the public is.

22:13.540 --> 22:18.300
I bet they even didn't know
the man they were voting for was dead.

22:18.900 --> 22:22.000
They knew.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.000
The cake.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.400
What's that?

22:32.400 --> 22:35.600
Well, we had reason
to believe you'd win.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.500
We just wanted to show you
how we felt about this.

22:38.540 --> 22:40.000
There's writing on it.

22:46.800 --> 22:50.700
"Dan, Dan,
he is our man"

22:50.740 --> 22:55.300
"If he can't do it
nobody can"

23:00.100 --> 23:04.000
That's very…

23:05.900 --> 23:07.400
Thank you.

23:08.300 --> 23:10.500
I'll treasure it always.
