03:08.120 --> 03:09.050
We're at dispatching range

03:09.620 --> 03:11.050
Ready the flyer squad

03:31.210 --> 03:33.070
This is base, preparing formation

03:33.070 --> 03:34.040
Repeat, preparing formation

07:13.460 --> 07:15.630
Send out the alert! Level three emergency!

07:16.830 --> 07:17.360
At once!

07:36.450 --> 07:38.880
Are these guys wind element users?

07:44.520 --> 07:46.260
It's chakra.

07:46.790 --> 07:48.590
They're molding chakra into their wings

07:48.600 --> 07:50.930
so the mists enable them to fly.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.440
Sky ninja? So these are the Sky Ninja?

08:07.280 --> 08:09.980
We're at our limits.

08:10.780 --> 08:12.450
Just who exactly are these people?

08:13.550 --> 08:17.560
The Second told me stones of people who excelled at manipulating chakra

08:17.720 --> 08:20.430
to create new techniques for flying through the sky

08:21.090 --> 08:23.100
They .formed the Sky Country

08:23.900 --> 08:27.530
It's a horrible sight for them to be in Konoha as an enemy.

08:28.070 --> 08:30.540
If that's really them could they be working
for an ally that wants to overthrow us?

08:30.540 --> 08:30.770
If that's really them could they be working

08:30.770 --> 08:32.240
for an ally that wants to overthrow us?
If that's really them could they be working

08:37.039 --> 08:39.250
Anyone who targets the village of Konoha

08:40.409 --> 08:43.480
no matter how incredible, will attract the whole Fire Country's revenge.

09:27.690 --> 09:30.100
What the hell happened here?

09:31.100 --> 09:34.570
Kid! Give me a hand!

09:41.880 --> 09:43.640
Gimme the beam, old man...

09:53.690 --> 09:54.790
Let's hurry him to the hospital.

09:56.090 --> 09:57.720
Unfortunately, he has a punctured lung

09:59.230 --> 10:00.990
At this rate, he wont make it to a hospital

10:01.660 --> 10:03.530
So old man. you're a doctor then?

10:05.870 --> 10:09.400
He has air leaking from his lungs into the pleural cavity

10:10.100 --> 10:11.640
his chest can't handle it much longer. Quickly.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.810
so down there?

10:22.220 --> 10:25.580
There! Now he should be okay for you to take him to the hospital.

10:25.790 --> 10:28.090
Take him? But I

10:28.250 --> 10:29.550
Those guys are still out there though!

10:30.220 --> 10:31.320
Concentrate on taking care of him.

10:32.330 --> 10:35.890
I have to get to where those crows are flying around; the
area will be packed with people that need attention

10:36.500 --> 10:37.160
Kitty.

10:37.730 --> 10:39.000
Hey! are you calling me a kitty?

10:39.330 --> 10:42.170
Yeah... and you'd be wise to take him there now.

10:43.370 --> 10:46.570
Now I must continue my search for lives that need saving.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.310
You'll return to the battle as soon after ."am I wrong?

10:51.380 --> 10:54.710
And be careful with his chest!

10:54.910 --> 10:57.080
Yo! Old Man!

10:59.150 --> 11:02.120
How the hell did he know my name?

11:18.700 --> 11:20.370
We've got to put out surveillance on those guys.

11:21.410 --> 11:22.740
Neji, what do you know about them?

11:23.710 --> 11:26.080
Their guns-are crafted with chakra

11:26.680 --> 11:27.480
I see...

11:27.850 --> 11:30.750
Judging from their current rate of chakra consumption
and their remaining chakra level

11:31.050 --> 11:36.050
I'm guessing that we .can calculate how far they'll be able to fly their craft.

11:36.690 --> 11:38.060
So it seems.

11:44.000 --> 11:44.700
Tsunade-sama

11:45.570 --> 11:46.570
You summoned us?

11:50.500 --> 11:53.640
I'm unable to read this situation well.

11:55.940 --> 12:02.810
From here, go tend to the people of Konoha

12:04.080 --> 12:05.850
Shinobi from the Sky Country?

12:09.460 --> 12:10.620
Sensei! These people need your care.

12:17.730 --> 12:18.160
What's this?

12:18.630 --> 12:20.500
This child is okay. Somebody saved him.

12:21.230 --> 12:22.030
This one too.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.000
Naruto also brought .someone that had gone through a flawless surgery

12:26.370 --> 12:32.080
Who the hell is doing all of this?

12:33.380 --> 12:35.350
l Saw  the old man

12:37.350 --> 12:41.550
This one... and that one... All of these are his work.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.390
Shinnou... sensei?

12:44.420 --> 12:46.560
Yeah. I've heard of this guy

12:47.560 --> 12:50.030
Hey you, do you know that old man?

12:50.330 --> 12:51.600
You saw him?

12:51.600 --> 12:54.030
Where at? Where the hell is he now?

12:54.200 --> 12:55.670
Hey. dammit.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.900
I swear? If anything bad's happened to him... Hurry and tell...

13:02.170 --> 13:04.440
Hey! Who is this guy?

13:05.380 --> 13:07.450
You've grown. Naruto

13:08.010 --> 13:11.080
Does your pupil always cause you this kind of trouble?

13:12.020 --> 13:13.050
Always...

13:13.050 --> 13:16.390
Ah, old man this boy... uh...

13:16.390 --> 13:16.920
Amaru

13:17.620 --> 13:20.020
Hah, Amaru, and you're his sensei?

13:20.490 --> 13:25.130
Out of gratitude, he'll call me sensei whether I want him to or not

13:25.130 --> 13:27.030
Hen. figures

13:27.330 --> 13:31.170
If you hadn't showed up and saved so many injured

13:31.340 --> 13:32.870
Sakura-chan said she and the others would
have really had their hands full.

13:36.080 --> 13:39.140
Amaru's village is on the outskirts of the fire country.

13:40.250 --> 13:43.450
There's a hidden village in the vicinity

13:44.220 --> 13:46.180
called "Navan" that true form is a temple that pierces the sky.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.190
I've lived here since I first heard about it.

13:50.590 --> 13:52.860
True...form...

13:53.760 --> 13:56.460
Hah did you faint boy?

13:56.530 --> 13:57.160
Eh?!

14:04.670 --> 14:08.310
Hey. so you'll be leaving now that things have settled, right?

14:08.710 --> 14:12.710
Heh! Shinnou-sensei just came to opened an office in this village.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.980
We need some kind of place to sleep

14:15.710 --> 14:16.550
Ah, I see

14:17.280 --> 14:20.720
and that's why Medical-nin has to be on a 3-Man-Cell.

14:21.290 --> 14:21.690
Eh?

14:23.460 --> 14:27.490
Sakura-chan? Hinata? Eehh? 3-Man Cell?

14:27.960 --> 14:31.560
Umm. with you along, makes our 3-Man-Cell

14:33.370 --> 14:35.670
for yer sake, kiddo - it's why they're goin along..

14:35.970 --> 14:37.700
Na -wait uh - hold uh hold up

14:37.870 --> 14:38.270
Here

14:38.540 --> 14:38.900
Huh?

14:40.210 --> 14:42.140
It's a charm from Jiraira-sensei

14:47.950 --> 14:49.510
Well then, its settled

14:50.980 --> 14:51.820
Naruto-kun.

14:52.050 --> 14:52.350
Heh?

14:54.250 --> 14:55.120
let's work our best

14:57.790 --> 15:00.120
What is she thinking?

15:30.220 --> 15:32.260
Ninpo: Chouju Giga
[Ninja art: Super Beat Scrolls]

15:51.540 --> 15:52.040
The enemy has arrived!

15:52.740 --> 15:53.210
How many?

15:54.010 --> 15:54.710
One

15:59.120 --> 16:02.020
Hen, Konoha must be blind with emotion, to be expected

16:02.350 --> 16:05.760
Still, let's can get fired up and take on this dog.

16:06.220 --> 16:09.430
Right! First-waves - welcomes them, and play nicely..

16:09.700 --> 16:13.260
Sir! Hurry men - make tums, then form an 8-fIyer-guard team

16:18.700 --> 16:20.540
One... two... three...  four...

16:21.640 --> 16:24.380
Can I do this? With only me I'll have to keep them from piling up on me.

16:27.410 --> 16:29.480
In the sky you'll be on par to compete with those guys.
Take flight with a bird into their occupied territory.

16:29.920 --> 16:34.290
But use your best (judgement and don't take any unnecessary risks

16:34.520 --> 16:38.120
We want to see how they respond to our actions,
and (then turn away and come back.

16:39.990 --> 16:43.030
Here I go...

16:43.530 --> 16:46.460
They shouldn't give me much trouble if I can knock them into the ocean.

16:46.470 --> 16:49.100
That should work    more or less

17:19.329 --> 17:22.470
That was kinda quick...but I wonder if it was a little too much.

17:23.700 --> 17:27.300
It's as Tsunade-sama said. They're making
repairs and didn't take much interest

17:27.810 --> 17:36.980
I can't believe they would just Sit out in the open
like that. Hey. your calculations were dead on.

17:37.780 --> 17:40.020
I knew their hiding place would be over there.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.520
Since we could observe their chakra with Neji's Byakugan,

17:44.820 --> 17:46.890
it was only(3 matter of time until a pilot's range could be determined.

17:47.290 --> 17:50.590
Even then, it would have taken us four months to find them.

17:51.430 --> 17:51.960
As expected from you, you saw through their plan.

17:52.060 --> 17:53.830
As expected from you. you saw through their plan

17:53.970 --> 17:57.400
that aside, with our Four-Man-Cell dispatched.
it's only natural that we'd finishes up, no sweat

17:58.400 --> 18:04.440
At this point though, I think the only thing Konoha can do to oppose
these sky ninja is to prevent them from occupying any territory.

18:04.840 --> 18:05.640
It should be a good plan. It should be a good plan.

18:19.220 --> 18:21.490
Thank you for coming, Sasuke-kun.

18:22.060 --> 18:22.930
What do you want?

18:23.800 --> 18:28.030
We received intelligence this morning that Konoha was attacked.

18:29.100 --> 18:33.200
We expect that it was completely destroyed
by the ninja from the sky country.

18:33.870 --> 18:38.040
Why would you think D still have any interest in Konoha?

18:39.410 --> 18:43.710
I don't care about Konoha anymore

18:44.180 --> 18:48.320
I didn't call you to talk about that

18:52.220 --> 18:53.120
Orochimaru-sama?

18:53.930 --> 18:54.760
Sasuke-kun

18:56.330 --> 18:59.430
there's a man there that I want you to bring to me

19:00.100 --> 19:01.000
A man?

19:01.530 --> 19:02.200
He's a doctor

19:03.030 --> 19:03.900
That doctor

19:04.300 --> 19:07.770
once gave me a valuable reincarnation jutsu.

19:08.870 --> 19:10.610
But he and I are different

19:10.880 --> 19:14.210
I expect his immortality jutsu is completely perfect.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.010
so that's why you want him?

19:17.550 --> 19:23.020
Bring him to me. I need that jutsu now.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.370
Amaru's village is in this jungle further upstream

19:36.330 --> 19:38.070
It's a hidden place with many historic ruins.

19:38.740 --> 19:42.240
Yeah, but why do we have to take these boats down the river?

19:43.170 --> 19:45.510
We'd be much faster on foot

19:45.710 --> 19:51.050
In this "friendly" jungle there are poisonous insects,
poisonous snakes and other beasts!

19:51.320 --> 19:51.920
Eah!!

19:52.520 --> 19:56.020
here are more cannibalistic monsters in this river as well.

19:56.050 --> 19:58.290
And I think I would stay away from the fish too.

20:03.130 --> 20:06.600
Huh?

20:06.660 --> 20:12.740
You're safe. In either of these boats and you
can go straight to the doctor riding with you.

20:13.910 --> 20:15.770
And I brought this scalpel, just in case.

20:16.370 --> 20:20.240
Hah! That's a laugh, a doctor protecting a Shinobi.
And just what can you save with that scalpel?

20:20.580 --> 20:26.280
Are you going to cut someone down with it?

20:26.520 --> 20:27.580
You're one to talk!

20:27.950 --> 20:30.750
Even if you're skilled I'm Shinnou-sensei's'best student!

20:31.090 --> 20:34.160
But you're just a ninja and don't have anything Dike that in your cold world!

20:34.790 --> 20:37.630
Do you even known what it's like to have friendships and create bonds with people?

20:37.800 --> 20:47.340
Why you! I can't let that go! I know lots of people...
Iruka-sensei, Kakashi-sensei, and even Ero-sennin.

20:47.640 --> 20:57.180
They're a STRONG force! I understand what it's like
 to have strong bonds that can never be broke

20:57.780 --> 20:59.020
oww!

20:59.750 --> 21:01.850
What was that for. Sakura-chan?

21:02.390 --> 21:03.720
Be quiet for a minute.

21:05.360 --> 21:05.720
Huh?

21:18.340 --> 21:22.470
There're wings made of chakra in the sky. A patrol pilot   It's
the same type that we saw dunng the assault on Konoha.

21:22.470 --> 21:22.510
the same type that we saw dunng the assault on Konoha.

21:22.510 --> 21:24.410
There're wings made of chakra in the sky. A patrol pilot. It's
the same type that we saw dunng the assault on Konoha.

21:25.140 --> 21:27.010
They really are pests...

21:28.210 --> 21:29.850
Get under cover, now!

21:36.120 --> 21:36.550
Crap, this is bad!

21:37.360 --> 21:38.990
Hey! What the hell!

22:07.120 --> 22:10.320
They definitely passed us by . That was close.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.900
Amaru? Amaru!

22:50.660 --> 22:53.000
Hey! Amaru! Hang in there!

22:53.730 --> 22:57.430
You're definitely,gonna make it!

22:57.940 --> 22:59.240
Amaru, well done.

23:02.470 --> 23:06.580
Shinnou-sama. It's my goal to become a ninja.

23:10.920 --> 23:11.980
Amaru,

23:12.680 --> 23:15.150
I've already abandonded the path of fighting.

23:15.950 --> 23:17.990
There was once a need for fighting strength.

23:18.590 --> 23:21.060
but the ability to save someone's life is much more valuable.

23:21.930 --> 23:23.760
The strength to save someone's life?

23:24.630 --> 23:29.430
And just as there is a sword that ends people.
there is also a sword that saves them.

23:34.300 --> 23:35.640
Naruto!

23:52.620 --> 23:53.260
Huh?

24:06.470 --> 24:07.000
*& Idiot! i

24:12.580 --> 24:15.180
Hey... by chance are you...

24:20.250 --> 24:20.820
Naruto?

24:24.720 --> 24:25.220
Poison!

24:28.130 --> 24:31.160
Naruto! Hang on! Naruto!

24:45.440 --> 24:47.610
Naruto? What were you doing to end up like this?

24:48.180 --> 24:51.210
Err... about that... it's nothing.

24:57.550 --> 24:59.720
The foreign substance spreads quickly,

25:00.190 --> 25:02.890
a person with a blade can give care for anything.

25:03.290 --> 25:06.400
If the wound has something in it the first thing is to squeeze it out.

25:07.230 --> 25:10.370
And save the fallen Shinobi who have become friends.

25:12.170 --> 25:13.940
They've grown

25:16.040 --> 25:17.110
There, it's fine now.

25:23.950 --> 25:28.350
This visitor managed to drain off the poison and
neutralize the rest with the perfect antidote.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.220
Amazing! It's flawless!

25:33.320 --> 25:33.860
Amaru

25:40.200 --> 25:41.960
Well done.

25:41.970 --> 25:43.070
Yes sensei

25:49.870 --> 25:51.770
It worked out

25:52.640 --> 25:53.780
I'm glad

26:07.990 --> 26:08.990
don't worry,

26:09.830 --> 26:11.690
the only beasts are bug catchers.

26:12.260 --> 26:13.830
Just a little further to Amaru's village.

26:22.670 --> 26:27.040
Hey umm, back there, you handled everything completely.

26:28.250 --> 26:29.510
You were amazing.

26:30.350 --> 26:31.510
No I'm not.

26:32.150 --> 26:33.680
Shinnou-sensei is the amazing one.

26:34.350 --> 26:36.390
But back there...

26:36.850 --> 26:40.520
Uh a corsage

26:40.520 --> 26:43.660
kinda womanly in the middle.

26:43.990 --> 26:44.930
umm... hey you don't happen to be...?

26:46.930 --> 26:51.600
EH? I knew it You're a girl!

26:52.140 --> 26:54.040
Same difference, isn't it?

26:54.270 --> 26:55.370
I'm just surprised is all

26:55.870 --> 26:57.910
For that reason isn't it easier to go as a boy?

26:58.510 --> 26:59.910
Uhh. Well... yeah.

27:05.180 --> 27:08.820
I wonder of Shinnou-sensei could ever see the real me.

27:11.620 --> 27:12.120
I get it.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.290
you're in love with Shinnou o-chan

27:15.490 --> 27:18.590
Idiot! That's not true!

27:23.500 --> 27:27.500
Dammit. I can't move well ye.

27:28.070 --> 27:29.100
Sorry

27:31.440 --> 27:32.670
Look! Over there!

27:32.940 --> 27:34.780
Huh? What's going on?

27:58.900 --> 27:59.330
Amaru

27:59.440 --> 28:00.740
Hey. calm down!

28:01.170 --> 28:02.040
Wait!

28:57.030 --> 28:59.900
No. it can't be

29:07.700 --> 29:08.770
Anybody?

29:09.270 --> 29:10.840
Where is everyone?!

29:11.770 --> 29:13.210
Isn't anyone here?

29:18.950 --> 29:22.450
Where did everyone run off to? Please come out!

29:48.710 --> 29:51.550
A..mara "Are you Alright?

29:54.980 --> 29:57.090
Sen..sei

30:14.600 --> 30:15.070
What?

30:15.940 --> 30:16.610
What happened here?

30:16.940 --> 30:17.410
Sensei

30:17.740 --> 30:18.770
Sensei hang in there

30:22.280 --> 30:23.210
Sninnou sensei

30:26.280 --> 30:27.580
How could I have been so

30:29.990 --> 30:32.890
jumping in was all I could do

30:34.220 --> 30:34.720
Why?

30:35.320 --> 30:41.230
because...you are...my student

30:48.540 --> 30:52.840
I'm leaving it up to you now

30:53.840 --> 30:59.050
Work together with the others...to rescue the villagers

31:01.050 --> 31:01.920
Sensei

31:02.150 --> 31:02.650
#unrecognized text#

31:05.520 --> 31:07.490
Sensei. Sensei

31:08.190 --> 31:10.360
please, don't die

31:28.840 --> 31:29.410
Why...

31:38.450 --> 31:42.020
Sensei..

31:51.430 --> 31:54.570
sensei Shinnou'saved my life

31:55.670 --> 31:59.540
I was an orphan to start with

32:00.240 --> 32:03.610
I was struggling from an unknown disease...no one wanted to help me

32:04.180 --> 32:10.050
but sensei Shinnou wasn't scared of the spread and looked after me

32:17.330 --> 32:22.930
When I woke up. Sensei Shinnou said to me with a smile

32:27.000 --> 32:28.970
you did well

32:37.980 --> 32:39.610
Umm...

32:39.620 --> 32:45.250
We can't find any of the villagers bodies, which
probably means they evacuated somewhere

32:45.850 --> 32:48.660
we should search for the villagers on our own.

32:49.190 --> 32:49.760
alright C

32:54.930 --> 32:58.400
I can't do well without you

33:10.310 --> 33:16.880
I haven't... I haven't told you ...anything yet

33:18.120 --> 33:19.250
not a thing

33:33.340 --> 33:34.800
What is this chakra?

33:43.450 --> 33:44.680
oh its just Naruto

33:46.280 --> 33:46.680
Naruto

33:47.780 --> 33:49.150
hey Sakura-chan

33:49.920 --> 33:51.020
Weren't you with Hinata?

33:51.720 --> 33:52.050
yea

33:52.890 --> 33:54.360
anyway, what are you doing?

33:54.990 --> 33:55.920
What about the search for the villagers?

33:57.030 --> 33:58.360
Sakura-chan, look at that

34:01.660 --> 34:02.300
what .is that!?

34:02.970 --> 34:05.800
Maybe the ruins Shinnou was talking about

34:24.020 --> 34:24.850
Amaru!

34:25.790 --> 34:27.090
what .are you doing here?

34:31.659 --> 34:33.030
I am Reibi
[Reibi- Zero tail (a tailed beast (bijou)]

34:34.260 --> 34:38.230
in the age filled with war, and man-kinds hearts filled with darkness

34:38.800 --> 34:40.199
I shall re-imerge (literal translation is I shall be revived)

34:40.699 --> 34:41.600
What's she saying?

34:41.940 --> 34:43.300
Amaru, what's wrong?

34:43.969 --> 34:50.139
I devour darkness of the minds, form, and grow

34:51.449 --> 34:54.179
to conquer this world with darkness

34:57.350 --> 34:57.890
damn

34:58.290 --> 34:59.020
where is he?

35:06.430 --> 35:08.030
ninpou choujuugiga

35:16.070 --> 35:17.300
One more to go

35:18.110 --> 35:21.340
I can't buy anymore time

35:25.480 --> 35:27.450
Sai is approaching his limit

35:29.680 --> 35:31.050
Kakashi sensei, stay here

35:31.650 --> 35:35.020
It's close to time. I will draw their attention

35:42.930 --> 35:44.370
Finally, my part is over

35:48.200 --> 35:49.440
I'll leave the rest to you

35:50.210 --> 35:51.710
I hate to do work but

35:52.610 --> 35:54.380
It can't be helped

35:57.710 --> 35:58.480
alright then,

36:02.620 --> 36:05.420
Planning on blinding me using the Sun as his background huh

36:05.420 --> 36:07.420
They are well trained

36:07.720 --> 36:09.760
But that's a mistake

36:11.290 --> 36:13.360
ninpou, kage shibari no jutsu

36:29.180 --> 36:31.780
Hits about time for the counter attack

36:32.480 --> 36:35.850
rest is up to you, 4th of our 4 man formation

36:49.560 --> 36:52.500
what is this...strange chakra

37:07.450 --> 37:07.980
Sakura-chan?

37:09.380 --> 37:10.150
you...!

37:28.770 --> 37:29.870
You...

37:30.440 --> 37:32.870
you got something very interesting

37:33.470 --> 37:35.610
why don't you use that power?

37:36.010 --> 37:38.750
That power you have.

37:39.180 --> 37:40.510
I want it!

37:46.020 --> 37:47.320
Sakura-chan.

37:47.490 --> 37:48.590
perv-hermitt (ero-sennin)

37:49.490 --> 37:52.030
This power that hurt everyone

37:52.430 --> 37:53.730
I shouldn't use it

37:54.460 --> 37:57.800
Show me your dark powers

37:58.830 --> 38:01.440
the darkness within your heart

38:02.400 --> 38:05.410
I will...rescue Amaru with my own strength

38:06.010 --> 38:08.040
You know best

38:08.510 --> 38:10.810
That you can't do it without that power

38:10.810 --> 38:12.010
What?

38:12.280 --> 38:14.110
His name is Sasuke?

38:14.920 --> 38:18.620
you couldn't shine out the darkness in his heart

38:20.620 --> 38:22.220
you can't rescue anyone

38:22.220 --> 38:25.030
Thats it...

38:43.040 --> 38:48.050
get-angry, more anger

39:03.730 --> 39:07.100
There's nothing...you can do

40:05.360 --> 40:06.260
Ero-sennin

40:12.330 --> 40:14.630
thats right

40:15.240 --> 40:18.240
I need to  do this., bring her back with my own powers

40:24.810 --> 40:25.410
Amaru!

40:26.980 --> 40:28.550
Amaru, wake up!

40:28.950 --> 40:31.890
aren't you Shinnou's student?

40:32.690 --> 40:34.720
a student should follow the master's teaching

40:35.390 --> 40:39.130
Don't you want to be told you did well?

40:41.860 --> 40:43.300
Shinnou sensei

40:56.580 --> 41:02.450
not only Naruto but...I even lost Amaru's dark mind

41:10.890 --> 41:13.790
It should be enough to activate it

41:14.600 --> 41:21.970
If D drag the world into this war. it will be easy enough
to gather more darkness of the hearts

41:39.850 --> 41:42.460
rise Ancolbuntium

41:42.490 --> 41:49.030
Destroy the 5 countries and ressurect the country of sky

42:04.080 --> 42:04.640
Amaru

42:06.550 --> 42:07.210
are you ok?

42:08.250 --> 42:09.120
you did well

42:10.080 --> 42:11.020
you came back

42:11.750 --> 42:14.520
Shinnou is probably saying the same

42:19.330 --> 42:19.560
yea

42:30.500 --> 42:31.100
Sakura-chan

42:31.970 --> 42:32.570
Are you ok?

42:42.950 --> 42:45.790
why ..why do you have to hit me

42:46.020 --> 42:48.750
you were staring at me so close up

42:50.260 --> 42:51.860
so. what happened?

42:53.390 --> 42:55.900
I'm not really sure how to explain it but

42:56.500 --> 42:58.400
case solved!

43:00.700 --> 43:02.400
what's happening!?

43:02.740 --> 43:04.840
what's sloved9 nothing is sloved at all!

43:05.310 --> 43:09.010
Could Hinata and the missing villagers all be inside this thing?

43:09.540 --> 43:13.780
Sakura-chan. take Amaru and go back to town now

43:13.980 --> 43:17.020
I will rescue Hinata and the villagers

43:17.480 --> 43:20.820
alright. I will be back ..with reinforcements

43:20.820 --> 43:22.820
Amam-chan. lets go

43:24.460 --> 43:26.930
what's wrong? get on my back

43:27.330 --> 43:29.300
hurry. Amaru-chan

43:29.460 --> 43:30.700
I don't want to?

43:33.200 --> 43:35.670
I want to do what Shinnou sensei would have

43:36.770 --> 43:38.040
I want to rescue them

43:40.940 --> 43:43.280
but you staying won't make any difference

43:43.580 --> 43:44.780
alright then

43:45.480 --> 43:46.580
Come with me

43:48.280 --> 43:49.480
hold on Naruto

43:50.980 --> 43:51.220
yes!

43:52.250 --> 43:53.020
We'll be-fine

43:53.450 --> 43:55.790
I will protect Amaru

43:56.220 --> 43:57.260
Hey!

44:03.460 --> 44:05.160
oh well...he never listens

44:08.740 --> 44:11.070
anyway, reporting back to town is first priority

44:13.670 --> 44:14.140
what!?

44:16.840 --> 44:17.310
The forest...

44:18.550 --> 44:19.510
It's moving...

45:14.530 --> 45:15.970
Naruto!

45:29.350 --> 45:30.020
Whats the orders?

45:30.150 --> 45:31.050
Should we alttack again?

45:31.850 --> 45:33.520
There should be no need for it

45:34.220 --> 45:35.790
hurry it up with the restocking!

45:36.190 --> 45:36.490
understood

45:37.020 --> 45:39.160
hurry it up with the restocking

45:39.160 --> 45:41.390
We will gladly be your opponent

45:42.060 --> 45:44.030
As a bonus to annihilating Konoha

45:48.300 --> 45:49.200
Bits almost time

45:49.840 --> 45:51.740
The enemies are almost done restocking

45:52.370 --> 45:54.840
We are going to get hit hard

45:58.010 --> 45:59.950
You shouldn't worry about that

46:02.350 --> 46:07.420
Because...It's impossible...for me to fail

46:20.730 --> 46:21.600
What's happening?

46:52.830 --> 46:54.300
imp impossible!

47:00.110 --> 47:01.540
in...insects!?

47:18.360 --> 47:19.890
Oh well

47:58.160 --> 47:58.930
hey Naruto

47:58.930 --> 47:59.260
hmm?

47:59.830 --> 48:03.670
We are ...nah, the whole ruins is flying

48:05.070 --> 48:08.640
damn it, what's going on?

48:08.810 --> 48:12.540
How many times am I going to be surprised today

48:13.180 --> 48:15.080
You are my student

48:16.020 --> 48:16.750
Sensei...

48:17.520 --> 48:17.950
Amaru

48:19.920 --> 48:20.490
Lets go

48:23.190 --> 48:23.420
..Alright

48:26.760 --> 48:30.360
As long as this was made by people, someone have to be controlling it

48:31.160 --> 48:35.070
yea. we need to find the person and stop this ruin

48:35.500 --> 48:38.700
and then save the villagers

48:40.710 --> 48:41.870
Those guys are

48:42.340 --> 48:42.770
Damn it

48:47.280 --> 48:48.180
Orah!

48:48.410 --> 48:49.750
Get out of the way!

49:02.400 --> 49:04.500
Well done both of you

49:15.240 --> 49:17.880
knew it! I knew it!!

49:22.820 --> 49:24.020
I believed in you

49:24.050 --> 49:25.420
I believed in you!

49:25.820 --> 49:27.650
I knew you couldn't have died

49:28.190 --> 49:31.020
I knew you wouldn't leave me be

49:31.120 --> 49:31.790
Why?

49:32.760 --> 49:33.590
How is this possible?

49:34.890 --> 49:36.630
What is going on here?

49:37.060 --> 49:42.500
hmm... Where can I start explaining to have you
 delinquents to understand what's going on

49:44.570 --> 49:47.870
This flying ruins is called "Antourupantiamu"

49:48.010 --> 49:50.010
it-looks like a ruin, but...

49:50.210 --> 49:56.250
It was made by the soranins over couple of decades with their research

49:56.680 --> 49:58.850
It is the ultimate weapon of destruction

49:59.850 --> 50:01.350
Antourupantiamu?

50:02.990 --> 50:06.660
It means "the stronghold of the King's capital"

50:06.890 --> 50:07.930
hey old man

50:08.530 --> 50:10.030
What are you doing inside their stronghold!?

50:10.430 --> 50:13.570
After getting hit by so many,of their Kunai

50:14.400 --> 50:18.940
It's easy enough to fool amature ninjas such
as Hinata and Sakura to make my death

50:25.610 --> 50:26.280
jutsu?

50:27.210 --> 50:30.280
Why are you talking so funny!?

50:31.080 --> 50:32.720
What are you trying to accomplish here old man?

50:33.520 --> 50:36.690
You're here to fight the sora-nins right!?

50:38.690 --> 50:40.330
Why can't you figure it already?

50:40.760 --> 50:43.360
Sensei...

50:44.330 --> 50:47.270
Why should I fight with my own people?

50:48.030 --> 50:48.600
Amaru!

50:53.110 --> 50:57.480
14 years ago. in order to steal the jutsushiki of the Reibi

50:58.010 --> 51:01.750
disguised myself as a traveling doctor

51:02.180 --> 51:03.180
you...

51:03.650 --> 51:05.050
you lied to Her all along!

51:05.450 --> 51:09.720
13 years to find the jutsushiki to revive Reibi

51:10.320 --> 51:12.290
I finally found it

51:12.790 --> 51:14.230
In the Konoha village,

51:14.560 --> 51:17.530
and the power of Reibi

51:17.930 --> 51:20.500
The dark chakra

51:20.900 --> 51:22.630
Dark Chakra!?

51:23.070 --> 51:24.140
Wait Naruto!

51:27.540 --> 51:29.370
He's not himself right now

51:29.980 --> 51:32.010
So we should bring him back

51:32.010 --> 51:33.300
Please!

51:39.550 --> 51:41.920
To bad Amaru

51:42.920 --> 51:45.790
I didn't go crazy and nothing is wrong with me

51:46.630 --> 51:50.460
If there is something wrong, that would be me in the past

51:54.400 --> 51:56.200
What are you doing Amaru?

51:56.470 --> 51:57.970
Are you trying to imitate Shinnou-sama?

51:58.170 --> 52:00.840
Even if you dress the same, your skills aren't

52:03.010 --> 52:05.580
Amaru, it looks great on you

52:07.450 --> 52:08.480
Thank you

52:10.050 --> 52:12.350
When darkness forms in human heart.

52:13.620 --> 52:18.990
Reibi's seeds can be implanted into them to materialize them.

52:20.290 --> 52:22.930
It's easy to understand it once realised

52:23.330 --> 52:25.560
It took 14 years though

52:25.930 --> 52:27.600
Darkness  of the heart?

52:29.100 --> 52:31.000
humans lose hope

52:32.370 --> 52:34.740
When about to be taken over by sorrow.

52:35.270 --> 52:37.980
the emotion that gets directed towards those who caused it.

52:38.310 --> 52:40.710
Anger. Hatred

52:41.180 --> 52:44.050
all of those emotions creates dark chakra

52:45.080 --> 52:50.020
D made them attack your village, to implant Reibi into you

52:51.490 --> 52:52.020
No way...lies, lies

52:52.020 --> 52:52.690
Its all lies

52:53.190 --> 52:55.030
right sensei?

52:55.890 --> 52:57.030
Sensei!

52:59.230 --> 53:00.800
Master?

53:01.300 --> 53:02.300
Student?

53:02.530 --> 53:05.040
What is this useless relationship?

53:05.870 --> 53:09.410
You went with my plan and you were used

53:16.010 --> 53:18.020
Your skill progressed Amaru

53:18.750 --> 53:19.850
you've done well

53:20.290 --> 53:20.750
Yes

53:26.260 --> 53:31.530
A person that had their life saved never doubts their saviour

53:32.260 --> 53:32.760
Amaru!

53:33.900 --> 53:34.930
Hey Amaru!

53:41.010 --> 53:41.540
ohh. I feel it

53:41.540 --> 53:43.310
I feel it

53:43.310 --> 53:46.340
Strong dark chakra

53:57.260 --> 53:58.460
I won't forgive you for this

54:01.390 --> 54:04.160
You I cannot forgive!

54:08.900 --> 54:13.440
power of the dark chakra is not used only for reviving Reibi

54:14.110 --> 54:16.140
Depending on how its used

54:16.710 --> 54:18.440
Things like this can be done to!

54:43.170 --> 54:45.740
This is the jutsu of nikutai kassei

54:46.540 --> 54:54.240
by having this ultimate body? it is possible for the
 first time to open up all 8 gates up to the shimon
Shimon is death gate, he is referring to the opening of the
 chakra gates in which Rock Lee and Gai uses as well

55:11.730 --> 55:13.600
Do you understand now?

55:13.600 --> 55:19.000
what it means to have an ultimate body

55:20.140 --> 55:22.040
ohh sorry

55:22.340 --> 55:26.340
Its still hard to control this power!

55:37.820 --> 55:39.320
Now i see

55:40.020 --> 55:44.230
It was sized for the person with the ultimate body to sit on

55:45.230 --> 55:48.830
Its truely a seat made for the king

55:58.080 --> 55:59.510
I don't agree to this!

56:17.900 --> 56:18.530
you...

56:18.900 --> 56:20.960
the king?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.270
I don't agree!

56:34.510 --> 56:35.480
Amaru?

56:36.410 --> 56:37.710
muscle...

56:38.350 --> 56:41.820
by destroying and rebuilding gets strengthened

56:42.690 --> 56:47.120
By knowing the mechanism of tissue reconstruction by medical-ninjutsu

56:47.590 --> 56:48.990
and by destroying the body

56:49.560 --> 56:54.930
It is possible to strengthen the body at any time

56:55.300 --> 56:56.400
you...

56:57.840 --> 57:01.270
Chakra release utilizing the ultimate body

57:02.140 --> 57:06.280
and this is the ultimate shot

57:07.040 --> 57:09.610
Chou-kassei-ken
[Super Speed Fist]

57:29.200 --> 57:31.000
I so happy

57:31.270 --> 57:34.000
You can still move after that hit?

57:35.540 --> 57:36.040
but...

57:36.710 --> 57:39.880
you dirtied my seat

57:40.380 --> 57:41.980
and you'll pay for that

57:48.090 --> 57:50.690
You think you you fooled me?

57:51.260 --> 57:52.690
to bad

58:00.900 --> 58:02.570
Now show me

58:03.800 --> 58:06.200
The dark power that you possess

58:07.670 --> 58:09.040
No way you are getting away with that!

58:17.350 --> 58:18.980
Why do you hold back?

58:20.020 --> 58:21.450
Reibi lets me know

58:22.550 --> 58:27.290
You have powers sealed in you that can entertain me

58:28.460 --> 58:29.560
I won't...

58:30.090 --> 58:31.560
use it!

58:37.970 --> 58:39.640
I want to test out

58:40.470 --> 58:41.810
This power

58:42.210 --> 58:44.310
The power of the dark chafers

58:44.310 --> 58:45.180
you...

58:45.280 --> 58:45.510
you...

58:46.680 --> 58:51.050
If I don't punch you with my fist

58:51.920 --> 58:54.820
I won't be satisfied

59:04.130 --> 59:05.130
Naruto...

59:05.860 --> 59:06.560
This is

59:07.100 --> 59:10.400
no, this is it

59:11.500 --> 59:16.410
The power you believe in, which can be obtained .from years of work

59:17.370 --> 59:20.280
This is the limits of it

59:21.480 --> 59:23.010
mankind are weak

59:23.980 --> 59:25.520
do not possess any fangs nor claws

59:27.280 --> 59:29.620
capable of only crying

59:31.090 --> 59:35.390
but why were they able to make this world their own?

59:36.030 --> 59:37.860
Its because.

59:38.760 --> 59:41.230
out of all creatures..

59:42.570 --> 59:43.470
humans are the most.

59:45.470 --> 59:47.040
Creul!!!

59:53.680 --> 59:54.580
Am I wrong?

59:55.480 --> 59:59.150
desiring for higher grounds than other creatures

59:59.750 --> 01:00:00.720
Mankind left animals behind

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:03.320
and evolved

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:06.590
That power that maid it happen.

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:08.360
Is definitely.

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:10.860
Not love!!!

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:19.200
You've gotta be kidding. Just because you got some strange jutsu.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.410
Well I'm not paying around.

01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:30.550
I don't feel like comparing the two,but...

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:38.350
My sensei, friends that are always there for me. Ero-sennin.

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:45.560
I Dove them. I loved them all. I can't take it anymore!

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:55.740
That's enough. Give me a break. I was wrong.

01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:02.510
What was it I was trying to teach someone like you? Defending someone

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:08.780
to the death? Love? Heh. heh!

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:13.960
Listen to how things have changed. Amaru.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.960
I'm going torment you without hesita (tion)

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:18.900
Shut up!

01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:30.170
Naruto! I... I... my strength...

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.340
That doesn't hurt at all!

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.440
Naruto.

01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:36.080
Let's go!

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.680
Chakra resuscitation sword
Kasseiken!

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:49.890
Naruto!

01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:59.970
That's a nice expression, Amaru. Don't forget that hatred.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:12.280
Never forgive me. Hahaha

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.020
Where there is a blade for .wounding people, there is

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:20.260
also a blade for saving people

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:31.570
Amaru. I...can still fight. All those things that make you sad,

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:38.770
that you regret, they don't matter. You can't hold yourself back

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:54.460
anymore. All the sadness, everything. I'll take it all in for you

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.570
You stay right there! Cause now I'm gonna kick your ass!

01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:13.310
Naruto...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...   Sensei.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:26.990
You're wrong. That's not what I meant You have to keep on living

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:36.370
That's, that's why you have to say good bye. You haven't said anything.

01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:46.710
have you. You haven't said...how you feel. You've gotta tell

01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:48.240
him right?

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:06.030
Yeah. It was the first time. I had been praised for doing something.

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:14.700
He praised me. For the first time, someone taught me what I should do.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.940
I see

01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:22.410
For the first time I thought, "am I pretty?". "I wonder what he

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:31.920
thinks of me?" Thoughts of sensei filled my head.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:41.700
For the first time I wanted to be liked. I wanted him to like me.

01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:53.910
Always...always. I've always loved you. sensei!

01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:57.610
Hahahaha!

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:12.890
twisted way of thinking on people! People, the feeling of

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:24.810
loving someone, the very heart of that emotion, there's no

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:35.220
way they'd all just turn into darkness! Guys like you are just.

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:39.890
worthless filth!

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:54.270
Cha. my chakra is...huh?

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:09.990
never...forgive you. Rasengan!

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.840
Wha...Sasuke?! You!

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:37.710
Sorry to butt .in but Orochimaru wants to borrow your power.

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:46.150
My power? And if I refuse you'll take me away by force?

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:49.290
If that's what you wish.

01:06:55.060 --> 01:07:01.170
You underestimate me. Thought my dark chakra had disappeared,

01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:04.970
did you? How naive! I have enough darkness swirling in my

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.440
heart to make it rot! Using my kassei no jutsu...
[Resosusculation Technique]

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:13.720
Try it.I don't mind, so give it a try.

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:21.190
Hurry up and show me.

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:26.230
Sasuke, knock it off! The more you beat him up the stronger he gets!

01:07:48.550 --> 01:07:49.250
Sensei...

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:53.790
What's wrong? Can't heal yourself?

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.130
Wha, what did you do?

01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:03.360
I already cut off your flow of chakra.   It-appears as though

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:07.200
you didn't even notice my Chidori Senbon?
1000 Birds

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:15.810
You disrupted my chakra control? When did you.

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:24.990
I would not kill you. I'm taking you to Orochimaru.

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:32.990
I'm not what Orochimaru is after. He probably wants this.

01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:37.000
The scroll I stole from Konoha

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:46.010
Hahaha? Don't .think you've won! This is far from over!

01:08:49.779 --> 01:08:50.479
Sasuke!

01:08:54.250 --> 01:09:01.859
Amaru. D have to go after him...Just.like you said. Amaru.

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:08.130
I may be able to save him. Giving up is easy. But that's all the more

01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:11.300
reason  ou have to go help everyone from the village.

01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:17.310
That's what he taught you about saving people, right?

01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:38.729
Sasuke, wait? How long have you been here! Tell me!

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:45.770
What's wrong?

01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:03.420
They followed me here so unknowingly, the idiots!

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.690
Who's the idiot!

01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:19.430
What do you think? You cant even use Chidori can you. This place takes

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.840
the chakra the Reibi collected and absorbs it. turning it

01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:34.420
into energy. All the chakra you've used up till now has been absorbed as

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.720
energy for the Ankol Vantian. You're powerless!

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:44.030
Quit your blabbering. Chakra has nothing to do with it!

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:50.770
I'll just beat you up with my fists then!

01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:56.570
Whether or not our chakra is being absorbed makes no difference.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.480
What a happy-go-lucky bunch you are

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:09.650
Did you honestly think I'd bring you all the way to the
center of the Vantian just to seal your chakra?

01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:11.050
Did you honestly think I'd bring you all the way to the
center of the Vantian just to seal your chakra?

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:33.610
Ahaha! Did you truly believe the Ankol Vantian was just a flying fortress?

01:11:33.610 --> 01:11:40.150
Bijou just for that? Within this fortress is a weapon

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:47.920
powerful enough to destroy the 5 Great Ninja Countries in an instant!

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:48.860
What did you say!

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.260
Watch!

01:12:25.930 --> 01:12:27.900
Wha. What was that just now?

01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:40.540
Did you see it!? The power of the Sky Country! After I've destroyed the

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:49.120
5 Ninja Countries, the brotherhood of the Sky Empire will rule all!

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.250
Don't screw with me! Like I'd let you get away with it!

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:55.560
Fools!

01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:11.370
Sasuke!

01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:20.180
Hehehe! I'll start with you. Sasuke.

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:32.830
Damn you! Let Sasuke go!

01:13:48.980 --> 01:14:01.090
Everyone! Are you all okay...eh!  Wha, what is this?

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:06.990
Wha. What happened. Hold on. I'll save you!

01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:19.570
You mustn't touch it. This dungeon absorbs chakra.

01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:20.740
Hinata-san?

01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:26.380
Amaru-chan. at this rate the village people will.

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:29.820
See if you cant do something about the lock

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:34.350
Over there.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:58.980
Sensei...

01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:14.730
Sensei. I'll do my best.

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:30.840
What's wrong? Gan't do anything without, our chakra?

01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:33.810
Shitfaced kids!

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:40.590
Hehe. Look who's talking. You can't even fight against some

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:50.460
shitfaced kids without transforming into a monster! Don't fact so tough!

01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:02.710
shut will know the full power of the Sky Emperor1

01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:07.380
How unsightly   Someone who doesn't even
take time to measure his own strength

01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:11.990
calling himself the Sky Emperor. It's so pitiful it's humorous.

01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:13.720
What are you trying to do?

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:27.030
Surely you don't want to hasten your own death?

01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:31.170
So that's what you're planning. I understand, Sasuke.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:38.340
If you really want chakra so much. I'll give you all that you can handle!

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:56.900
Impossible! A mass of chakra so big the Reibi can't .absorb it!

01:16:57.930 --> 01:17:00.430
Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!

01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:07.140
Not yet! Alight!

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.550
Like I'd let you!

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.560
Die! Die!!

01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:30.630
What!?

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:35.470
Tatsumaki Rasengan!
[Tornado Rasengan]

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:52.090
I see. So that's your little trick.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.360
It's over.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Go!

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:29.720
You're no protector of lives, damn it

01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:45.470
To think that you'd get this far. However, I can't die like this!

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:46.240
What?!

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:52.650
It seems you figured it out. But to think that you managed

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:58.580
to sever the Reibi's attachment... I should have expected as much

01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:02.460
from the last surviving Uchiha. And the Kuubi Jiichuuriki

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:06.490
But in the end you two are nothing more

01:19:06.490 --> 01:19:08.060
than clueless brats!

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.600
What did you say

01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:17.040
Even I don't know what will happen if the Reibi is let loose!

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.690
Wait, Sasuke! Where are you going!

01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:52.710
What's happening. Wait! Stop!

01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:24.100
Hurry! Everyone get on! How do we make this thing fly?

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.410
Over there! Underneath that face, right in the middle

01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:38.120
Hurry up and get on. Amaru. Hinata, I need to pull this, right?

01:20:38.690 --> 01:20:39.520
Naruto-kun!

01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:42.560
Naruto...se, sensei...

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.960
Amaru, get on

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:52.260
What are you going to do? You can't fly

01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:57.640
There's still something left for me to do.
You go with everyone from the village.

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:00.010
No! I'm staying here!

01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:00.640
You can't!

01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:04.640
I said I'd stay so I'm staying! How many times do I have to tell...ah!

01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:07.750
Sasuke-kun!

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:09.350
Annoying.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.420
Naruto!

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:35.040
Alright! Thank you. Sasuke

01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:28.530
Get a grip You've gotta stop that guy

01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:36.200
Do you know why shinobi have students? We do it to have them inherit

01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:42.670
our Nindou. Your jutsu still has a long
Nindou means way of the ninja

01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:50.820
way to go. but you have the guts to never give up. Your Nindou is the

01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:53.020
spitting image of mine.

01:22:56.890 --> 01:22:58.220
Ero-sennin

01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:17.680
Guts...Guts...Guts!

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:26.490

01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:33.230

01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:58.620
He never stops does he

01:23:59.190 --> 01:24:00.150
He is an idiot, after all

01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:02.490
It coming this way.

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:04.560
We should get out of the way. shouldn't we.

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:05.760
Yeah.

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:13.770
Guts!

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.180
What's this?

01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:27.910
Can you see it. Neji?

01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:32.080
Heh. This isn't something you need byakugan to see.

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:32.780
Yeah.

01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:48.730
How's that for guts. Ero-sennin?

01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:50.840
Rasengan!

01:24:59.150 --> 01:25:00.280
Naruto-kun!

01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:06.450
Amaru-chan!

01:25:17.130 --> 01:25:18.600
Naruto! Naruto. I won't let you be alone.

01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:32.810
Naruto   I won't let you be alone

01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:55.670
Amaru, you're incredible.

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.570
Who is? You're the one always doing crazy things, idiot.

01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:05.980
Haha. Sasuke once told me something.
He said, "You have no idea what it

01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:13.150
Haha Sasuke once told me something
He said, "You have no idea what.it

01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:18.960
feels like for someone who's been Deft all alone." But. I had always been

01:26:19.190 --> 01:26:23.130

I an feel it. I can feel-our friendship.

01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:06.000
Good grief.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:14.580
This is the scroll containing the sassei no jutsu, huh?

01:32:15.810 --> 01:32:20.480
It's not liks,yoj to fail in bringing back Shinnou.

01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:23.790
Sasuke-kun.

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:28.930
Did anything good happen?

01:32:33.330 --> 01:32:35.100
I just had the feeling

01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:52.420
