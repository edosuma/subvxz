WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.170
Let me find it.
Let me watch it real quick.

00:44.962 --> 00:48.215
It's really good.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.470
I love it.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.264
The ad was polarizing.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.932
Yeah and it did end up getting banned.

00:57.015 --> 01:00.853
Stations would not run the ad because
it was, you know, so shocking for people.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.481
There was tension for the company
to be doing this gaming thing

01:04.565 --> 01:05.941
because it was really different

01:06.024 --> 01:08.443
than really the image
that the company was trying to cultivate.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.654
Some of the stuff like that commercial

01:10.737 --> 01:12.614
I don't think senior leadership
saw until it was done.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.700
You know we don't talk
about Microsoft Xbox.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.326
We just talk about Xbox.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.288
Because Microsoft was good
on the funding side,

01:19.371 --> 01:20.622
but bad on the branding side.

01:20.706 --> 01:23.292
And if they wanted to go market it
like they market Windows

01:23.375 --> 01:25.460
and they market Office,
it was a deal-breaker,

01:25.544 --> 01:27.254
it was not gonna be successful.

01:27.337 --> 01:32.092
The games industry did not speak
the same language as Microsoft.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.845
But, if we were gonna
do this really hard thing

01:34.928 --> 01:37.472
and not lose billions
and billions of dollars forever,

01:37.556 --> 01:38.932
we had to get it right.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.268
People had to have the belief
that they were working

01:41.351 --> 01:43.478
with the Xbox team,
and if that meant there was

01:43.562 --> 01:45.647
something slightly unconventional
that had to be done,

01:45.856 --> 01:48.400
the Microsoft bureaucracy
wasn't going to get in the way.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.613
There's a new contender
in the video game wars.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.031
Xbox is going to be....

01:54.114 --> 01:56.575
- The future.
- Truly the future of video games.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.243
Xbox.
Taking over the living room.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.704
Limitless, connected
digital entertainment.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.080
You guys never understood.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.458
The company is going
to face fierce competition.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.084
Sniper. Nooo!

02:06.168 --> 02:07.711
It's a ticking time bomb.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.546
It makes me very nervous
to actually play this for you.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.507
Xbox, getting a major overhaul.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.301
A bold vision for the future of gaming.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.178
It's the Xboooooooooooox!

02:28.482 --> 02:33.820
The Xbox is a breakthrough
game console that ships in fall 2001.

02:33.904 --> 02:38.450
Most console companies
start working on the next console

02:38.867 --> 02:41.912
as soon as they finish
the current console.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.249
So five years, six years, seven years.

02:45.332 --> 02:50.587
So for Microsoft to go from announcing
in 2000 to being on store shelves

02:50.671 --> 02:53.340
in the fall of 2001, is kind of insane.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.718
Before Xbox landed on store shelves,

02:56.802 --> 02:59.805
the team had to run
a gauntlet of very public deadlines.

02:59.888 --> 03:04.059
A hardware rollout in Las Vegas
at the Consumer Electronics Show.

03:04.142 --> 03:09.147
A first glimpse of Xbox games
at Microsoft's Gamestock event in Seattle.

03:09.690 --> 03:14.319
And finally, an event that brought
the entire global gaming industry together

03:14.403 --> 03:17.614
to see what was new...
and judge it mercilessly.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.535
E3 is the biggest moment
of the year for games.

03:22.119 --> 03:26.915
For new entrants, it was really important
to show up and make a good impression.

03:26.999 --> 03:32.004
That E3 was critical for the Xbox,
but you know, a lot of what you're showing

03:32.087 --> 03:34.756
is beta software and beta hardware.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.343
Hardware that's not proven yet,
or probably not even finished.

03:38.427 --> 03:41.471
A lot of things at E3 can go wrong.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.848
Adding pressure,

03:42.931 --> 03:46.101
the lead executive
on Xbox development, Rick Thompson,

03:46.185 --> 03:49.479
had just left Microsoft,
which meant Microsoft's mission

03:49.563 --> 03:53.650
to quickly deliver an industry-changing
game console needed a new leader.

03:54.610 --> 03:58.030
The idea of finding somebody
else externally didn't make sense.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.616
We had a schedule
that is crazy to begin with.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.826
The project just didn't
have the time for that.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.037
Nor did we think that somebody externally

04:05.120 --> 04:07.289
could sort of fit into Microsoft
and make this happen.

04:07.539 --> 04:11.710
And so, I concluded
that it was something I needed to do.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.630
A new challenger enters!

04:15.297 --> 04:17.257
Sort of a fateful decision,

04:17.341 --> 04:20.177
because it led to the worst
18 months of my professional career.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.304
It's a hard project,
I mean what we are doing

04:22.387 --> 04:24.556
is something that is intensely difficult.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.849
Robbie was...

04:26.350 --> 04:28.644
Robbie was the grownup, was Robbie's role.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.354
Booo!

04:30.437 --> 04:33.524
We were a young group
of kinda rag-tag kids.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.734
Let's go ahead and take the cars,
give 'em 3...

04:36.318 --> 04:38.237
What the hell's that?

04:39.446 --> 04:40.864
You know I gotta demo to do up here.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.700
Really... I don't think Robbie
should be seeing this.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.664
What we needed more than anything else
is we needed an adult in the room.

04:48.747 --> 04:52.709
I was part of Office when it was,
was smaller, and then as it grew big...

04:52.793 --> 04:54.378
Robbie also has a sense of propriety

04:54.461 --> 04:56.588
and I don't think we had
a sense of propriety at all.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.967
The opportunity here way outpaces that
opportunity, I think is very exciting.

05:00.050 --> 05:03.428
He was the one inside
of Microsoft that Bill Gates trusted

05:03.512 --> 05:05.597
with all the complexity and the cost

05:05.681 --> 05:08.016
and the risk involved
in doing something like this.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.978
Robbie's a good guy. People can trust him.
He doesn't break his word.

05:11.061 --> 05:16.525
However, everyone who comes into games
can't be prepared for what it's like.

05:16.608 --> 05:17.985
Because it's an entertainment business.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.320
The software doesn't just have to work

05:20.404 --> 05:22.656
and have the right features,
it has to entertain also.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.408
This is hard.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.285
I had no clue what I was doing.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.621
I didn't play games.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.790
The business model I barely understood.

05:31.874 --> 05:34.042
We are launching an entirely new business,

05:34.126 --> 05:36.253
competing against two
established competitors

05:36.336 --> 05:38.964
in one of the largest
entertainment industries in the world.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.049
I was learning
something new every single day,

05:41.133 --> 05:43.719
and that meant obviously
I failed most days, too.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.555
I think the next six to eight weeks
are going to be super exciting.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.098
Little challenging.

05:48.182 --> 05:52.728
I didn't think about how to plan
for going from 20 people to 2000 people.

05:52.811 --> 05:56.064
We went from 4 people to a dozen people

05:56.148 --> 06:02.988
to hundreds to honestly thousands involved
in some way with the creation of Xbox.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.157
It was crazy. I mean it was no time at all

06:05.240 --> 06:08.744
before I didn't know everybody
in the organization anymore.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.538
When I think about it today it just makes
my head kind of spin sideways.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.999
Every week I would hear about
somebody I knew in the game industry

06:14.082 --> 06:16.627
that was moving up to Redmond
to work for the Xbox.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.462
We just said, this all has to get done.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.964
We need bodies.
So we hired people in bulk.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.341
We brought in teams of people.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.551
I remember thinking,
this is a lot of people

06:24.635 --> 06:26.553
changing their lives for this effort.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.555
It's either got to be something
that everybody believes in

06:28.639 --> 06:30.057
and they're willing
to uproot their families

06:30.140 --> 06:32.142
and get behind this initiative,
or it's going to be one

06:32.226 --> 06:35.521
of the biggest
cluster of all time.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.070
It became clear
that we needed our own place

06:43.153 --> 06:44.780
because we were just
gonna bust at the seams.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.074
So Microsoft has this beautiful campus

06:47.157 --> 06:49.409
and all these beautiful buildings
and everyone works together.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.203
We were not part of that.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.996
We went to this campus called Millennium

06:53.205 --> 06:56.458
which was still in Redmond
but pretty far away from Microsoft.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.919
Part of that was we needed space.

06:59.002 --> 07:02.548
But part of it is like we need
a few miles away from main campus

07:02.631 --> 07:04.716
to get some breathing room
to do something different.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.638
We were deliberately a renegade team.

07:09.721 --> 07:13.350
They were rebels
inside of the Microsoft empire.

07:13.892 --> 07:17.938
We were kids in our early 20s
who loved video games

07:18.021 --> 07:22.025
and could not believe that Microsoft
had given us jobs to go create them

07:22.109 --> 07:24.152
and we were all kind
of growing up together.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.530
The thing about games is,
it's Hollywood for nerds.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.448
You have your star directors.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.702
You have your Ferrari-driving
rendering engineers.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.828
Congratulations!

07:32.911 --> 07:35.622
And after a full day
of working on making games,

07:35.706 --> 07:37.374
we would get together and play games.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.793
And there was a little bit
of a weird culture of not leaving

07:40.335 --> 07:42.171
which I think was,
maybe not the healthiest.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.966
Maybe like a college dorm room
kind of vibe.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.719
Your social circle was Xbox.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.597
Your family was kind of Xbox.

07:51.722 --> 07:55.267
But we all had a common purpose,
a passion around games.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.519
Being able to do something very different

07:57.603 --> 08:01.481
and revolutionary was where
you was getting our energy from.

08:02.065 --> 08:05.611
Because we were still
young, we had moments where we were like,

08:06.486 --> 08:09.239
"Wait a minute, like,
am I the best person to be doing this?"

08:10.199 --> 08:14.161
It was definitely open to kids
making decisions above their pay grade.

08:14.244 --> 08:18.457
You had a bunch of passionate people
who weren't necessarily 100%

08:18.540 --> 08:20.959
the most qualified people
to be doing their jobs,

08:21.043 --> 08:23.962
running as fast as they can
to make this thing happen.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.714
We were young and we were naive.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.133
You know I always call it
the best funded startup ever.

08:28.217 --> 08:32.346
Me, in my twenties, you know, I had,
millions, millions of dollars of budget.

08:32.930 --> 08:36.850
And there wasn't really any oversight,
it was a little bit of the Wild West.

08:36.934 --> 08:39.728
You know I had to negotiate
all the components that went in.

08:39.811 --> 08:43.649
Hard drives, power supplies,
the circuit board.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.943
Here I am, this kid,
negotiating these deals

08:46.026 --> 08:49.071
that are hundreds of millions of dollars.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.740
There were definitely
some terrible decisions being made.

08:51.865 --> 08:55.953
But on the other hand, that level
of freedom, you know, made Xbox happen.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.873
What resulted was sort of a weird
combination of craziness and genius.

09:02.376 --> 09:06.296
My recollection of that time was
being so fascinated by watching

09:06.380 --> 09:10.300
this big company around us
try to wrap its brain

09:10.384 --> 09:12.845
around what it meant
to be an entertainment brand.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.557
We didn't have a lot of interdependencies
with the rest of the company.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.476
It was Robbie, right,
that had to go over to main campus

09:19.560 --> 09:21.520
and deal with Microsoft people.

09:21.603 --> 09:25.107
One day some executives
came to visit the studio.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.776
And one of those people
who came was Bill Gates.

09:27.860 --> 09:31.822
I showed him my cinematic tools
and how I wrote scripts

09:31.905 --> 09:34.032
and how I laid down cameras in the engine.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.411
Bill spent time with Marty O'Donnell,
our audio director.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.496
Chief whatever you're gonna do,
make it quick.

09:39.580 --> 09:44.626
It's raining aliens!
Oh Jesus, why you do this to me?

09:44.710 --> 09:47.796
The hopes of all the covenant
rest on your shoulders, Chieftain.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.840
He spent time actually

09:49.923 --> 09:52.467
watching Marty play some
of the themes from <i>Halo.</i>

10:00.934 --> 10:04.396
He went to go see our art department
- where one of our 3
- D artists

10:04.479 --> 10:07.691
was sculpting a character in clay,
making a maquette.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.611
And at the end of the Bill visit,
we got in the conference room,

10:10.694 --> 10:12.863
the leads of the studio
and there was a pause.

10:13.780 --> 10:17.159
And you can see the magnificent machine
that is his brain,

10:17.242 --> 10:21.330
calculating down the Microsoft org chart,
from him at the top all the way down

10:21.413 --> 10:26.960
to the crazy artists in this studio,
in a gravel pit, literally.

10:27.044 --> 10:33.133
And Bill leaned forward and he said,
"So, there are artists who work here?

10:33.634 --> 10:36.720
It really was
a cultural change for the company.

10:38.931 --> 10:42.476
Xbox was already forcing people
within Microsoft to think differently..

10:42.643 --> 10:45.479
But what really mattered
was changing public perception.

10:45.771 --> 10:50.400
Behind the scenes, software engineers were
hard at work building Xbox's capabilities.

10:50.609 --> 10:54.988
Now the hardware team had a chance
to win over the doubters on a big stage.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.408
At the Consumer Electronics Show
in Las Vegas.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.954
CES was a trade show,
where companies from around the world

11:02.037 --> 11:04.998
would come to unveil
the latest in technologies.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.542
A lot of buying decisions from retailers

11:06.625 --> 11:09.294
get made at that show
for the holiday season,

11:09.378 --> 11:11.004
and so we had a lot of proving to do.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.924
The press was skeptical,
gamers were skeptical.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.385
"You don't know how to do this stuff,
you've never done this before, good luck."

11:16.468 --> 11:18.846
The gaming industry is not a believer.

11:18.929 --> 11:21.807
While Microsoft works
on the insides of the new Xbox,

11:21.890 --> 11:25.602
it focuses an equal amount
of attention on the outside.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.689
I was the creative director of Xbox.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.149
Horace Luke is the man.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.279
Horace Luke is the man.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.073
What Horace had to do was,
take the thing that we had

11:38.156 --> 11:40.826
produced in hardware and then
figure out some wrapping around it.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.329
The first time we ever showed him
like "Hey, you're going to need to put

11:44.454 --> 11:48.208
this board that we're about to manufacture
for, you know, millions of consoles

11:48.292 --> 11:50.294
into something that looks good."

11:50.460 --> 11:52.504
He's like, "What the [BLEEP]?"

11:52.588 --> 11:55.883
My office was where
everybody brought their ideas,

11:55.966 --> 12:00.596
from the technology team to the
design team, to the management team.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.389
At the time that we were building

12:02.472 --> 12:04.892
the original Xbox,
there were no other consoles

12:04.975 --> 12:07.102
with a hard drive or an Ethernet port.

12:07.186 --> 12:10.898
So how do we put something
around this that vents heat,

12:10.981 --> 12:13.567
that survives a drop test, and looks cool.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.652
And you have to fit all of this of course

12:15.986 --> 12:19.865
into a box that's not gonna be giant
sitting in your living room.

12:20.449 --> 12:23.535
It was a constant battle
between the different groups.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.079
I went through thousands
of different sketches,

12:26.205 --> 12:29.583
trying to jam it and shrink it
in every way possible into a box.

12:29.875 --> 12:33.170
I remember him saying like, "Well
maybe we just gotta slim it down, like,

12:33.253 --> 12:34.838
you know, we'll just dress it in black."

12:36.590 --> 12:38.383
Everything was very aggressive-looking.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.427
The console itself was large.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.387
It was bulging on the top.

12:43.013 --> 12:46.308
It looked like
the engine cowling on a Dodge Hemi.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.477
It was the physical embodiment of power,

12:48.560 --> 12:50.479
like no other console's
ever been designed like this.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.565
It was quite a miracle
to fit everything in that box.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.609
Looking back today,
you say the thing is huge,

12:55.776 --> 12:59.154
but in comparison to the PC
of the '90s, it was tiny.

12:59.238 --> 13:02.741
It is a small miracle that
we actually were able to pull this off.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.868
And it looked awesome!

13:08.914 --> 13:11.959
The 2001 Consumer
Electronics Show is packed

13:12.042 --> 13:15.379
with every new gadget and gizmo
about to hit stores.

13:15.671 --> 13:22.135
CES 2001, in Las Vegas, in the convention
center hall, Bill Gates was there.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.096
CES will give actually
give us a better idea

13:24.179 --> 13:27.307
of just where Microsoft is going
to fit into the gaming market.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.852
For the very first time,
Microsoft was going to get

13:29.935 --> 13:32.855
to show off
its final Xbox hardware design.

13:32.938 --> 13:33.981
Good morning.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.441
Welcome to CES.

13:37.192 --> 13:40.988
Everybody felt like we were on the verge
of doing something special, historic.

13:41.071 --> 13:44.992
Ah, for the first time,
let me now unveil Xbox.

13:47.536 --> 13:50.873
But when you show up as the third entrant

13:50.956 --> 13:54.126
into the space
with well-established competitors,

13:55.127 --> 13:56.879
you have to break out,
you have to be bold.

13:57.671 --> 14:01.008
How do you unveil a product
in a way that might surprise the world

14:01.091 --> 14:03.969
and get the world to see Microsoft
doing something differently?

14:04.052 --> 14:09.016
If you smell what The Rock is cookin'.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.438
The Rock says...

14:14.521 --> 14:18.108
We decided to bring The Rock to CES.

14:18.192 --> 14:20.694
There was honestly some disbelief,

14:20.777 --> 14:24.740
like you know, Bill Gates, The Rock,
like, what's going on here?

14:25.407 --> 14:26.408
Thank you. Thank you, Bill.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.911
It was really like
muscle-bound Hollywood meets,

14:28.994 --> 14:31.371
you know, gamer geek of the tech world.

14:31.455 --> 14:33.874
It just might appear
that The Rock and Bill Gates

14:34.124 --> 14:35.501
don't have a heck of a lot in common.

14:39.296 --> 14:42.341
Well The Rock's here to say that
that can't be farther from the truth.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.928
The Xbox is everything The Rock is.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.096
Cutting edge, powerful, exhilarating.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.140
And they were funny together.
Like, it actually worked.

14:50.224 --> 14:52.017
And they looked like
they were best friends.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.478
I mean The Rock doesn't impress
easily, Bill, you know that.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.481
But I'm pretty damn impressed
with what we're seeing here today.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.193
And considering that this Xbox
at this moment is only running on

15:01.276 --> 15:04.196
one-fifth of the system's power
is very impressive.

15:04.738 --> 15:08.116
Bill, do you have any idea
what The Rock would be like

15:08.200 --> 15:10.744
if he were only running
on one-fifth of his power?

15:11.036 --> 15:14.623
- Well I, I would think that...
- It doesn't matter what you think, Bill!

15:17.835 --> 15:20.629
I'm sorry, Bill.
It's just a force of habit.

15:20.712 --> 15:21.797
Rock apologizes.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.050
It went well.
We showed nothing, technically.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.927
But it started to build the excitement.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.847
We gave it five out of five stars.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.306
We really like the Xbox a lot.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.600
You throw in an 8-gigabyte hard drive,

15:33.684 --> 15:35.936
a 10/100 Ethernet adapter,
and you basically have

15:36.019 --> 15:37.563
the most powerful system on the block.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.648
The Xbox is really slick.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.067
With excitement building
around the console,

15:42.150 --> 15:44.152
Microsoft was under tremendous pressure

15:44.236 --> 15:48.031
to build a portfolio of hit games
before the Xbox launch.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.159
By the time they had announced
that they wanted to do Xbox

15:51.243 --> 15:54.246
to the time when we needed to launch,
was an incredibly short period of time.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.540
We didn't really have
the luxury of saying,

15:56.623 --> 15:58.792
"Start building a game from ground up."

15:58.876 --> 16:00.252
That was almost impossible.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.129
What we were looking for were games

16:02.212 --> 16:05.424
that were partially in development,
ports already in development.

16:06.008 --> 16:09.344
We went out and started to look
for developers all over the world.

16:09.428 --> 16:13.390
A barnstorming tour
across North America, Europe,

16:13.473 --> 16:16.268
and ultimately Japan,
to create some sort of excitement

16:16.351 --> 16:18.937
around the console,
and convince game developers

16:19.021 --> 16:21.023
in particular that we could be successful.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.066
All right boys, let's roll.

16:23.150 --> 16:27.029
One day we presented a new idea from a,
a small game publisher that had come to us

16:27.112 --> 16:31.491
and said, "Hey, we want to dust off one
- of the 2
- D games that we had done for PC.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.243
We're going to really invest in it,

16:33.327 --> 16:34.578
we think it's going to be
really exciting."

16:34.661 --> 16:38.081
And these
newly-important executives in Xbox,

16:38.165 --> 16:40.751
who would review all the pitches

16:40.834 --> 16:44.630
from publishers and developers,
they said, "I don't think that game

16:44.713 --> 16:47.341
is going to be able to make
- the transition from 2
- D to 3D."

16:48.842 --> 16:50.761
They felt that it was complicated,

16:50.844 --> 16:52.387
they didn't really
understand the user interface,

16:52.471 --> 16:56.016
they thought that it was based on a game
that hadn't been all that successful.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.976
To my surprise it was rejected.

17:00.646 --> 17:03.941
And that game was called<i>Grand Theft Auto III.</i>

17:08.278 --> 17:10.948
It ended up selling
14-and-a-half million units,

17:11.031 --> 17:13.951
it was the top selling game of 2001

17:14.034 --> 17:16.537
and would have been
the top selling game of 2002

17:16.703 --> 17:19.373
if it wasn't beaten by its own sequel.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.875
It was the "pass" heard
around the industry.

17:21.959 --> 17:25.295
Despite seeing <i>Grand Theft Auto III</i>
go to PlayStation,

17:25.379 --> 17:27.631
Microsoft was still well-positioned

17:27.714 --> 17:29.883
to attract other developers
to its platform.

17:29.967 --> 17:33.929
We needed a vibrant
and strong third-party lineup of games

17:34.012 --> 17:35.222
that customers would love.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.225
And we wanted the industry to look at us

17:38.559 --> 17:41.603
as something that was going
to be worthy of development.

17:41.687 --> 17:44.273
We wanted to have the very best games.

17:48.026 --> 17:51.572
On March 13th, 2001,
Microsoft put their commitment

17:51.655 --> 17:55.409
to developers on public display
at their Gamestock event in Seattle.

17:57.828 --> 18:00.581
Thanks, and welcome to Gamestock 2001.

18:00.664 --> 18:04.334
What you're seeing
is a sneak peek at what's to come on Xbox.

18:04.418 --> 18:08.005
We're gonna start off
with a game whose vision was really

18:08.088 --> 18:12.342
just too big to fit in the PS2,
so we brought it over to the Xbox.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.143
Our characters certainly aren't the,

18:21.226 --> 18:23.854
muscle-bound superheroes,
you know, that we want to be.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.191
They're more like the poor, sad,
schmucks that most of us really are.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.445
Getting <i>Oddworld</i>.
That, that was important.

18:32.029 --> 18:34.698
It was an established
PlayStation franchise,

18:34.781 --> 18:37.743
beloved by the console game community.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.537
That's the last damn Gabbit there is!

18:40.621 --> 18:44.082
We had a chance to work with
an amazing creator in Lorne Lanning.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.543
Did all the voice acting for his own game.

18:46.627 --> 18:49.046
So Munch had these things
we called Fuzzles,

18:49.129 --> 18:51.256
and they were like "memememememe!"

18:51.340 --> 18:53.842
And Munch was like "You've got
to come over and do this for me."

18:53.926 --> 18:56.094
You know, and so then Abe's like,
"Come on guys, let's go!"

18:56.178 --> 18:58.305
Here goes... Whoa!

18:58.388 --> 19:00.974
And they were really vulnerable characters

19:01.058 --> 19:04.937
living in extremely dangerous worlds
that you're trying to keep them alive,

19:05.521 --> 19:06.772
but when they get whacked it's hilarious.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.149
Ooh!

19:10.275 --> 19:13.570
Next, we're really happy
to announce our new relationship

19:13.695 --> 19:19.785
with one of the premier racing developer
teams in the world, Bizarre Creations.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.829
<i>Project Gotham</i>.
It's a new product for Xbox.

19:24.456 --> 19:26.375
Now check out the reflections on this car.

19:26.625 --> 19:31.380
The whole environment is completely mapped
to the entire surface of this vehicle.

19:31.463 --> 19:35.342
<i>Project Gotham Racing</i>
was based on your style of driving

19:35.425 --> 19:38.011
as much as how fast
you crossed the finish line.

19:38.679 --> 19:41.098
For us it was an opportunity
to make this amazing,

19:41.181 --> 19:45.811
really accessible,
fun, arcade racing game.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.062
It was a really important
part of our launch.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.439
And that was just the beginning.

19:49.523 --> 19:52.776
Hardcore, freestyle snowboarding.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.361
This is only one mountain

19:54.444 --> 19:57.155
of seven international mountains
we'll be bringing to you in <i>Amped</i>.

19:57.865 --> 19:59.658
<i>AZURIK</i> That double-ended axe
is pretty wicked looking,

19:59.741 --> 20:01.952
and we can tell this is a
hand-to-hand fighting game.

20:03.996 --> 20:06.081
<i>NFL FEVER</i> Playing a football
game you wanna kick your buddy's butt

20:06.164 --> 20:07.583
so hard he's gonna wear it for a helmet.

20:09.918 --> 20:13.755
And that's it for our show today, I hope
you got to see everything that you wanted.

20:13.839 --> 20:15.299
Did you see everything?

20:15.674 --> 20:18.051
<i>Halo! Halo!</i>

20:18.802 --> 20:21.346
Oh, I feel like I am forgetting something.

20:21.430 --> 20:22.764
What was... What was it?

20:23.348 --> 20:26.226
Oh, <i>Halo.</i> How could I forget <i>Halo?</i>

20:26.518 --> 20:27.895
Hey everybody, so I'm Jason.

20:27.978 --> 20:30.397
I'm one of the co-founders
of Bungie and the lead on <i>Halo.</i>

20:34.359 --> 20:36.570
Bungie was a Mac-first developer.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.947
That's where they started,
that's where they'd had their success

20:39.031 --> 20:42.117
with <i>Marathon</i> and <i>Myth</i> and <i>Myth II</i>.

20:42.201 --> 20:45.746
But Bungie was also dealing
with the aftermath of a catastrophe.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.457
<i>Myth II</i>, one of their hottest titles,

20:48.540 --> 20:52.419
had an installer bug that could erase
a user's entire hard drive.

20:52.836 --> 20:55.589
In order to fix the bug
and keep the company above water

20:55.672 --> 20:59.801
and working on new games,
they needed a serious cash infusion.

20:59.885 --> 21:01.470
Apparently they had
this thing called <i>Halo</i>.

21:01.553 --> 21:02.721
I hadn't seen it yet.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.389
Some of my guys had.

21:04.765 --> 21:07.142
They had multiple games in development,

21:07.226 --> 21:10.062
but all I wanted was this new thing
that they were working on.

21:10.145 --> 21:14.483
So we did a deal, and bought out the
company and they started to work on <i>Halo</i>.

21:15.484 --> 21:19.988
That's really when true development
began on what the game would be.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.033
When we were purchased,<i>Halo</i> was not a game.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.993
There was no real story.

21:25.077 --> 21:28.664
There was no real sense
of what the gameplay tempo would be like.

21:28.747 --> 21:32.543
We knew it was powerful
to control a space marine

21:32.626 --> 21:35.045
who moved fast and could jump
into a sophisticated vehicle

21:35.128 --> 21:37.840
and you know haul ass
around this alien world.

21:37.923 --> 21:39.174
And that was it.

21:39.258 --> 21:40.717
What do you think Jason?
- I got something for ya.

21:40.801 --> 21:42.135
Do you?

21:42.219 --> 21:43.303
People knew about <i>Halo</i>.

21:43.387 --> 21:45.681
They knew that we'd been acquired
by Microsoft, they knew about Xbox,

21:45.764 --> 21:47.140
they knew we were still
working on the game.

21:47.224 --> 21:50.936
That period of getting <i>Halo</i>
from a series of prototypes

21:51.019 --> 21:56.525
to on a disk playable by an Xbox
was just a mad rush to get this game done.

21:56.608 --> 22:01.697
But there was this excitement
that we had something special.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.866
It makes me very nervous
to actually play this for you.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.076
Um, welcome to <i>Halo</i> on the Xbox.

22:12.457 --> 22:16.879
We started off that demo showing you
flying to the land in a Covenant ship.

22:16.962 --> 22:18.255
You know, running around the environment,

22:18.338 --> 22:21.592
getting in a vehicle, doing all those,
you know, building block <i>Halo</i> things.

22:23.051 --> 22:26.138
We had our test environment,
what we called a B30.

22:26.763 --> 22:30.392
The island map in the middle of the water
with <i>Halo</i> in the background.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.605
It was just fun to play.

22:36.440 --> 22:37.774
Whew!

22:39.234 --> 22:43.155
Gamestock was that real
first coming-out party for us

22:43.238 --> 22:45.574
and it was just that moment where I think

22:45.657 --> 22:48.327
the whole organization
began to wake up to,

22:48.785 --> 22:50.954
oh, there's something really special here.

22:51.914 --> 22:53.498
Thank you. That's it. Good night.

22:54.875 --> 22:57.461
Xbox had made a high risk bet on <i>Halo</i>.

22:57.669 --> 23:01.381
At the time, first-person shooters
were considered PC games.

23:01.465 --> 23:04.092
The only right way to play
was with a keyboard and mouse.

23:04.676 --> 23:07.721
At the time, people thought,
well how are you going to translate,

23:07.804 --> 23:10.349
you know, mouse and keyboard game
into a console game?

23:10.432 --> 23:15.479
Dual-stick first-person shooters had
almost never been done on a console.

23:15.562 --> 23:18.023
I remember,
right before the demo, Ed was very clear.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.191
He's like, "Hey when you're playing,

23:19.274 --> 23:22.694
like make sure that people
see the controller.

23:22.778 --> 23:25.572
What we need to demonstrate is,
you can play a shooter

23:25.656 --> 23:28.408
with thumb sticks,
maneuvering around the environment."

23:31.119 --> 23:32.412
You can go back and you can look.

23:32.538 --> 23:37.584
Adamant blog posts
that shooter games like <i>Doom</i>

23:37.960 --> 23:40.003
would never work with a game controller.

23:40.587 --> 23:45.133
Can people actually play a first-person
shooter on a controller like this?

23:45.217 --> 23:46.969
Is the audience going to accept it?

23:48.178 --> 23:50.055
While gamers wrestled with the idea

23:50.138 --> 23:52.224
of a first-person shooter on a console,

23:52.307 --> 23:55.686
critics also keyed in
on a not-so-tiny issue.

23:56.353 --> 23:57.729
I don't like the controller.

23:57.980 --> 24:00.983
Unfortunately, it's big,
I think it's too big.

24:01.066 --> 24:02.442
The Duke, they call it.

24:02.776 --> 24:06.154
The Duke wasn't
a small controller, it didn't feel cheap.

24:06.238 --> 24:08.407
It felt, it felt like
you could kill somebody with it.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.450
You had to have gorilla hands
to work with this thing,

24:10.534 --> 24:13.120
it was the industry's
biggest game controller.

24:13.203 --> 24:15.455
The Duke controller was like
a newborn baby.

24:15.539 --> 24:18.834
I mean
the thing was like 9 pounds, 3 ounces.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.294
You had to kind of hug it.

24:20.377 --> 24:23.213
As an adult with big hands
you can hold it farther back,

24:23.297 --> 24:24.381
and it's really comfortable and cool.

24:24.464 --> 24:27.593
It was done bass-ackward
as most things were in the original Xbox.

24:27.676 --> 24:31.138
To get to that design,
we kind of used you know

24:31.221 --> 24:33.599
the human factors, ergonomic approach.

24:33.682 --> 24:37.477
For those of us with smaller hands,
we all thought, "Oh my God,

24:37.561 --> 24:39.271
did all these guys
just sit in a room and go,

24:39.354 --> 24:41.481
'Oh, yeah! This is gonna be great!'"

24:41.565 --> 24:45.319
It was like, "Oh, yeah, this is
totally not going to work for us."

24:45.402 --> 24:47.654
And it was like,
"Okay, this is a problem."

24:47.738 --> 24:51.617
Perhaps we didn't take into account
the full range of hand sizes.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.703
There's no way we can ship Duke in Japan.

24:54.786 --> 24:57.080
People couldn't use it there.

24:57.164 --> 24:59.583
There was almost a plea,
you know, "Carl-san,

25:00.751 --> 25:03.337
you've gotta find a way
to make this smaller, please."

25:03.420 --> 25:06.632
We knew it wasn't the right thing,
but we didn't have enough time.

25:07.216 --> 25:11.595
E3 was coming up,
and so we had to go with what we had.

25:15.349 --> 25:17.309
On May 17th, 2001,

25:17.392 --> 25:22.439
global gaming's biggest event, E3,
kicked off in Los Angeles.

25:22.648 --> 25:26.401
The E3 is clearly the Super Bowl,
the Olympics, the World Cup,

25:26.485 --> 25:28.529
all rolled into one
for the video-game industry.

25:29.112 --> 25:32.032
For Team Xbox,
it was the most important public test

25:32.115 --> 25:35.452
for their new console
before a looming November launch date.

25:35.994 --> 25:38.497
We're trying to make an impression at E3,

25:38.789 --> 25:41.458
and we don't know what hardware
we're gonna be able to show,

25:41.667 --> 25:44.586
and are we gonna try
to show a lot or a little?

25:44.670 --> 25:45.963
Should we show games at all?

25:46.046 --> 25:49.550
We were heads down,
focused on having all of our games

25:49.633 --> 25:51.802
prepped for E3 and it nearly killed us.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.220
It's Broadway. It's opening night.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.180
You're going to read the reviews
the next morning

25:55.264 --> 25:57.307
and you're either hot or you're a flop.

25:57.391 --> 26:01.228
I was pretty eager to get to E3
and get hands-on with the Xbox.

26:01.812 --> 26:05.065
But, your first time
making hardware, is painful.

26:05.607 --> 26:08.986
And what you demo,
and what ends up on the store shelves

26:09.069 --> 26:10.821
are often very different things.

26:10.904 --> 26:14.658
And so, I was really skeptical
that this Xbox is gonna be ready.

26:16.410 --> 26:20.038
It's a pleasure for me to be
the first to welcome you to Los Angeles,

26:20.664 --> 26:22.875
for what I'm sure is going to be
quite an exciting week.

26:24.126 --> 26:26.044
- So, it's 8
- AM in the morning.

26:26.420 --> 26:31.758
The hardware team is like literally
using duct tape to get the box done.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.721
Sony had had their event the night before,
and a party afterwards.

26:39.516 --> 26:44.730
This was gonna be our coming-out party,
and we now have a hungover media group

26:45.063 --> 26:49.443
at 8 o'clock in the morning,
coming to see Xbox.

26:49.526 --> 26:51.653
That is not where you want to be.

26:51.737 --> 26:53.655
We've made Xbox a reality.

26:54.698 --> 26:57.326
And you can see here if I slide this down,

26:58.452 --> 27:02.414
Xbox itself, now live, and ready to go.

27:02.497 --> 27:05.542
I walk out on stage,
and I do my first line.

27:06.126 --> 27:08.420
And in fact, if I press this
little button here in the front...

27:08.921 --> 27:13.091
And then I, you know, hit the magic button
that's supposed to start the Xbox.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.260
You'll see Xbox will actually start up.

27:16.261 --> 27:17.304
We can bring that video up.

27:20.182 --> 27:21.642
We can bring that video up?

27:22.267 --> 27:23.936
And nothing happens.

27:26.271 --> 27:27.731
Nothing happened.

27:28.232 --> 27:31.777
Well if we could bring the video up, Xbox
would be live and starting and running.

27:31.860 --> 27:33.987
I didn't know what to do
so, I just went on.

27:34.071 --> 27:35.906
So it's with great confidence

27:36.782 --> 27:40.369
that on November the 8th
in the North American market,

27:40.827 --> 27:42.704
you'll be able to go into retail stores...

27:44.122 --> 27:47.000
In less than a year's time, you're going
to release this thing into the wild

27:47.084 --> 27:49.044
and people are going to be able to play it
and you're gonna love it...

27:49.545 --> 27:50.796
and it doesn't turn on!

27:50.879 --> 27:52.339
It was a devastating moment.

27:52.422 --> 27:55.592
As the hardware planner,
like, I mean, my heart just sank.

27:55.676 --> 27:59.972
And you'll be able to get a box
just like this with Xbox in it.

28:01.181 --> 28:04.643
It was, um... a disaster.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.979
A legendary sort
of press conference snafu.

28:07.062 --> 28:09.773
We had to convince the press very quickly

28:09.857 --> 28:13.110
that we had a box that worked,
and we needed to get

28:13.193 --> 28:16.071
their hands on these games
as quickly as we possibly could

28:16.154 --> 28:19.408
so we could wash away
that moment that we had on stage.

28:19.491 --> 28:21.076
We're very excited about that.

28:21.785 --> 28:23.495
But the disasters kept rolling.

28:27.165 --> 28:28.500
The Xbox wasn't done yet.

28:28.584 --> 28:30.627
The graphics hardware
that they were running on

28:30.711 --> 28:32.796
was running about half the speed

28:32.880 --> 28:35.632
of what we expected
the final product to be at.

28:35.716 --> 28:38.927
Basically, I'm making excuses for it.
It was slow.

28:41.847 --> 28:46.727
Microsoft had never had
a meaningful presence at E3 before.

28:46.810 --> 28:48.395
The booth was packed.

28:48.478 --> 28:50.898
And we decide to show <i>Halo</i>
because we feel like we have

28:50.981 --> 28:52.900
to show what's going to be our key title.

28:53.150 --> 28:56.278
In terms of the games we were working on,<i>Halo</i> had the biggest role.

28:56.361 --> 28:59.615
And so, it was the E3 demo on the floor.

28:59.698 --> 29:02.201
So many people were coming in
with huge curiosity

29:02.284 --> 29:04.828
about what it was capable of,
and I was completely disappointed.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.496
I'm like, the frame rate's terrible.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.207
The split screen stuff, it's kind of cool

29:08.290 --> 29:10.501
but it just doesn't feel
like it's powerful enough.

29:10.584 --> 29:13.962
On the show floor,
the unfinished game seemed to fall short

29:14.046 --> 29:16.882
of its original promise
of revolutionary gameplay.

29:17.299 --> 29:22.054
So now you have
a bad launch event and the key title

29:22.179 --> 29:27.434
that's gonna carry the day looks bad
and people start to think we're crazy.

29:30.145 --> 29:32.439
Shortly thereafter E3, Peter Moore,

29:32.981 --> 29:36.193
he's at Sega, and he says "Hey, I wanna
give you our feedback from E3."

29:36.276 --> 29:39.321
That E3 was critical
for Sega to stay alive.

29:40.989 --> 29:43.951
In February of 2001,
Sega made the decision

29:44.076 --> 29:47.829
to discontinue the Dreamcast
and focus exclusively on software.

29:48.080 --> 29:53.544
Part of that transition included a huge
bet to focus on making games for Xbox.

29:53.627 --> 29:58.006
But a disastrous showing at E3
from Microsoft meant danger for Sega.

29:59.174 --> 30:04.137
As we were moving from being a first-party
to a classic third-party publisher,

30:04.221 --> 30:07.015
we absolutely needed
somebody like a Microsoft

30:07.099 --> 30:09.017
to get us through this difficult period.

30:09.268 --> 30:13.313
And so Peter comes up to me, he looks at
me and says, "Well, here's our feedback.

30:13.397 --> 30:16.441
Retailers aren't gonna stock you,
developers aren't gonna develop for you

30:16.525 --> 30:19.027
and consumers think the product's
not very good and it's too expensive."

30:20.487 --> 30:22.322
<i>MORTAL KOMBAT</i> Scorpion!

30:23.156 --> 30:24.283
I took it very personally.

30:24.867 --> 30:26.702
I'm the leader of the team.
It's my responsibility,

30:26.785 --> 30:29.913
it's my obligation
and I felt like I failed.

30:30.789 --> 30:33.750
This is my resignation letter
to my boss Rick Peluso.

30:33.834 --> 30:37.504
I wrote this on Friday,
- May 25th, 2001 at 2:02
- AM.

30:38.213 --> 30:41.300
It starts off, "My status
Importance High.

30:42.050 --> 30:44.011
This is not going to be
an easy email to write

30:44.094 --> 30:46.430
and frankly I've postponed
doing it several times.

30:47.055 --> 30:50.225
The short summary is that my direct
involvement in Xbox needs to end

30:50.726 --> 30:52.644
and sooner than either of us would like.

30:53.145 --> 30:56.273
I think this is both in my best interest
and the best interest of Microsoft."

30:57.232 --> 30:59.943
But Bill Gates
and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer

31:00.027 --> 31:02.362
did not accept Robbie's resignation.

31:02.446 --> 31:05.532
They just encouraged me to get it done and
said you've done a great job, keep at it.

31:05.741 --> 31:07.910
We're with you.
I mean it wasn't much more they could say.

31:08.702 --> 31:10.162
Right?
There's no advice they could give me.

31:10.245 --> 31:12.372
They were too far away to say,
"Hey, go do this."

31:12.456 --> 31:14.458
The only person who could
figure that out was me.

31:15.459 --> 31:16.793
I never told anybody on the team.

31:17.085 --> 31:19.046
Rick and Steve and Bill.

31:19.630 --> 31:21.131
They're the only people that ever knew.

31:21.215 --> 31:24.510
That gives you the sense
how personally challenging it was

31:24.593 --> 31:26.803
for a person who hates losing.

31:28.722 --> 31:30.432
Electronic Arts.

31:30.516 --> 31:32.309
It's one of the biggest
game makers in the world

31:32.392 --> 31:36.563
and its CEO Larry Probst was quoted
in the Financial Times as saying this,

31:36.647 --> 31:39.566
that "Microsoft has a lot to do
over the next few months.

31:39.650 --> 31:41.735
They are on a death march now."

31:41.818 --> 31:44.196
I don't think anybody had
an easy ride to launch.

31:44.279 --> 31:48.116
All we're thinking about
is getting the device done

31:48.408 --> 31:49.868
so that we can make launch date.

31:49.952 --> 31:56.917
If you didn't have console units on retail
shelves for a holiday, you missed a year.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.544
That holiday was vital.

32:00.337 --> 32:02.756
There were a lot of late nights.

32:02.840 --> 32:06.468
We were trying to engineer and design
something that we'd never done before.

32:06.552 --> 32:10.264
We were building the technology,
we were building the hardware inside.

32:10.347 --> 32:13.684
The Xbox circuit board is about, yea big.

32:14.268 --> 32:16.937
It had probably on the order of 800 parts.

32:17.020 --> 32:19.898
Parts of the Xbox were coming
from all over the world.

32:19.982 --> 32:21.733
Like Hungary, and Mexico.

32:21.817 --> 32:23.735
You know there were people
who went and lived in China,

32:24.236 --> 32:26.029
in a hotel room, for weeks on end.

32:26.113 --> 32:30.576
We would be flying back and forth with
hard drives to get stuff back to test.

32:31.076 --> 32:33.036
Microsoft had never
shipped a console before.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.873
It turns out there's a lot of regulation,
everywhere in the world.

32:36.081 --> 32:39.543
You had to be certified
by the right agency, and approved.

32:39.710 --> 32:42.129
Their approval
took longer than we expected.

32:42.212 --> 32:44.798
Parts wound up
getting delayed from suppliers.

32:44.882 --> 32:49.261
It was, every day, come into the office,
see a fire, try to put the fire out.

32:49.344 --> 32:51.972
We were tracking
the hardware, tracking the components,

32:52.055 --> 32:55.475
tracking our launch dates
with such an accelerated pace.

32:55.559 --> 32:57.019
It was, um, chaotic.

32:57.102 --> 32:58.270
- Chaos.
- Total chaos.

32:58.353 --> 33:00.647
People themselves
were doing Herculean things.

33:00.731 --> 33:02.482
We would sleep at the office.

33:02.566 --> 33:04.985
This was all happening in real time.

33:05.068 --> 33:06.361
It had just never been done before.

33:10.490 --> 33:15.412
Xbox was the toughest job
I will ever have or have ever had.

33:15.579 --> 33:16.914
I will never do it again.

33:16.997 --> 33:20.417
Every day was a challenge,
both sort of technically

33:20.501 --> 33:22.503
and professionally, but also personally.

33:23.086 --> 33:24.922
You know, you were lucky if you had

33:25.005 --> 33:28.175
a personal relationship
that survived launch.

33:28.509 --> 33:29.635
Mine did not.

33:29.718 --> 33:32.429
It's kind of like you're on this horse
that's bucking and you're thinking,

33:32.513 --> 33:35.766
"Okay, is this ever gonna stop
or will this be the end of me?"

33:37.559 --> 33:41.730
8 to 12 weeks before launch, we're coming
in way hotter than anyone expected to.

33:41.813 --> 33:44.858
We doubted whether
the hardware's gonna be done in time.

33:44.942 --> 33:47.319
We're not sure any of the games
are gonna be done in time.

33:47.402 --> 33:49.613
The ship is still on fire,
the plane hasn't landed,

33:49.696 --> 33:52.282
all the metaphors
for crashes you can think of.

33:53.158 --> 33:56.161
But in the end, that team believed.

33:57.079 --> 34:02.334
There's no second try at the Xbox,
so this was a Hail Mary culture,

34:02.417 --> 34:06.213
and if we were to succeed
it was going to be absolutely epic.

34:06.296 --> 34:07.673
Touchdown!

34:09.216 --> 34:14.972
November 15th, 2001,
Xbox was released in Times Square.

34:18.308 --> 34:21.228
Mr. Bill Gates!

34:24.648 --> 34:26.900
We painted Times Square green.

34:28.110 --> 34:30.696
Everywhere you looked
you saw the Xbox green logo.

34:30.779 --> 34:33.323
Xbox was up on all these big billboards.

34:35.951 --> 34:38.537
One of those moments in your life
you're never gonna forget.

34:39.788 --> 34:44.376
Here we are, huge line of gamers
down the street waiting to buy this Xbox.

34:44.459 --> 34:47.296
20 years old,
first time going to the city alone.

34:47.379 --> 34:50.424
I get on a bus
and I show up in Times Square.

34:50.507 --> 34:53.844
I go straight to the new Toys R Us
and I'm looking for the line.

34:53.927 --> 34:55.679
I'm prepared to stay there all day.

34:57.097 --> 35:00.809
We worked with the city
to open up the WWF Restaurant,

35:00.934 --> 35:03.187
across the street
from Toys R Us Times Square.

35:03.770 --> 35:05.731
And that's where all
the gamers came first.

35:05.814 --> 35:08.817
They have Xbox consoles set up everywhere.

35:08.901 --> 35:11.195
They pretty much just allowed
all the gamers to hang out

35:11.278 --> 35:13.655
and play and test out all these games.

35:17.910 --> 35:19.828
Bill wanted to be on-site.

35:19.912 --> 35:22.873
He wanted
to help hand over the first console.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.752
Bill Gates is down at a gaming system,

35:26.835 --> 35:29.296
shook my hand
and said, "You ready to play?"

35:29.379 --> 35:31.298
And then we were playing <i>Fusion Frenzy</i>.

35:31.632 --> 35:33.926
And Bill Gates made a comment
that he had actually taken

35:34.009 --> 35:36.512
two weeks off of work
just to practice this game.

35:37.221 --> 35:38.805
He wanted to beat the gamers.

35:38.889 --> 35:41.058
Does anyone know what the shoot button is?

35:42.100 --> 35:43.894
- It's the A, I think.
- A?

35:46.647 --> 35:48.065
He couldn't beat me.

35:48.815 --> 35:51.485
I absolutely took pleasure
in beating Bill Gates, yes.

35:52.236 --> 35:53.445
Thank you for this.

35:53.529 --> 35:55.989
I've been waiting a long time.

35:56.073 --> 36:00.327
Everybody got a tag on their wrist
and when your color was called,

36:00.410 --> 36:02.246
we brought you
across the street to Toys R Us,

36:02.329 --> 36:05.290
and Bill was there
to hand out the very first Xbox.

36:05.374 --> 36:09.086
Tonight's kind of a celebration,
it's after a lot of hard work.

36:09.169 --> 36:11.046
Ah, so, they count down.

36:11.129 --> 36:13.423
Bill Gates has it rung in on the register.

36:14.258 --> 36:16.885
Price is up there, 299.99.

36:16.969 --> 36:19.638
Four, three, two...

36:19.721 --> 36:23.517
One hits and he hands me the box and says,
"Don't worry, I'm buying it for you."

36:23.600 --> 36:27.062
I turn around with even more excitement

36:27.145 --> 36:30.440
and raise my prized
possession over my head.

36:31.525 --> 36:37.781
Edward Glucksman became the first gamer
in the world to ever own an Xbox.

36:38.991 --> 36:40.284
It was a magical night.

36:40.367 --> 36:42.744
I'm a 20-year-old kid
looking for a console.

36:42.870 --> 36:44.121
That's all I wanted to do.

36:44.204 --> 36:46.039
First time going to the city alone.

36:46.248 --> 36:47.749
I managed to get sent home in a limo.

36:47.833 --> 36:49.585
- He's a celebrity.
- Every night.

36:54.256 --> 36:55.591
They actually did it.

36:55.674 --> 36:58.510
You know, Microsoft actually built
and delivered this thing.

36:58.594 --> 37:03.223
The feeling was like, you know,
crying level of exhaustion

37:03.307 --> 37:06.143
and like intense pride
for the thing that we had made.

37:06.435 --> 37:10.355
There's never been a prouder
moment in somebody's early career.

37:10.439 --> 37:12.691
You know, I still have goosebumps today
thinking about it.

37:12.858 --> 37:15.235
I tell people that faith
is a force multiplier.

37:15.319 --> 37:17.362
That team believed.

37:17.821 --> 37:20.782
And because that team believed,
Xbox got done.

37:20.866 --> 37:22.784
If that team doesn't believe
and they're just there

37:22.868 --> 37:24.745
doing their jobs, we never finish.

37:24.828 --> 37:30.209
That small group of big personalities
managed not only to convince Bill Gates

37:30.334 --> 37:34.296
and the board that we wanted
to get into this nascent industry,

37:34.379 --> 37:38.717
but they also managed
to get an entire organization

37:38.800 --> 37:42.346
of game people created
and pointed in the right direction.

37:43.805 --> 37:49.853
Get on the subway, the whole station
is covered in Xbox logos.

37:51.647 --> 37:53.649
I had to sit down and started to cry.

37:53.732 --> 37:55.400
And even Kevin got emotional.

37:55.484 --> 37:59.279
It was an impossible task
that we should not have been able to do.

37:59.363 --> 38:01.365
I was tremendously proud of it.

38:01.448 --> 38:05.035
But at the same time, that was the end

38:05.118 --> 38:08.789
of that special moment in time
that we were all able to be part of.

38:10.290 --> 38:11.708
It was the end of an era.

38:14.795 --> 38:16.755
With the Xbox out of their hands

38:16.839 --> 38:20.801
and into living rooms around the world,
Kevin Bachus and Seamus Blackley

38:20.884 --> 38:24.096
left Microsoft for new adventures
in the game industry.

38:27.724 --> 38:30.227
Microsoft Xbox
went on sale at midnight,

38:30.310 --> 38:31.770
but when it comes to video games,

38:31.854 --> 38:34.481
it's not the system that counts,
it's the games.

38:34.565 --> 38:36.275
Nobody actually really cares
about the hardware,

38:36.900 --> 38:38.235
all they care about is the content.

38:38.485 --> 38:41.071
To be successful,
you have to give the gamers

38:41.154 --> 38:43.282
that platform-defining title

38:44.992 --> 38:48.495
that you had to go out
and buy an Xbox if you wanted to play.

38:48.996 --> 38:51.206
<i>Halo</i> was like this gem,
like this was going to be

38:51.290 --> 38:54.835
the diamond we offered up at Xbox launch.

38:55.043 --> 38:56.920
But remember, <i>Halo</i> showed up at E3

38:57.004 --> 38:59.631
6 months before the game
was supposed to launch,

38:59.715 --> 39:01.341
with pretty serious framerate issues.

39:02.259 --> 39:05.262
Why is it running like Internet video
from the early '90s?

39:05.345 --> 39:08.432
We got hammered
for how it showed up on the floor.

39:08.515 --> 39:10.142
This is our lead title.

39:10.225 --> 39:13.395
Are we gonna actually launch something
that is this terrible game?

39:13.478 --> 39:14.771
I think there was a bunch of panic.

39:14.855 --> 39:16.607
People didn't see what they expected.

39:16.690 --> 39:19.151
That was the part where people
actually got super worried.

39:19.651 --> 39:23.322
There was
an incredible amount of pressure on <i>Halo</i>.

39:23.405 --> 39:27.075
If <i>Halo</i> wasn't a hit, then
the future of Xbox really was in doubt.
