We've never used those engines.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.448

- But we do use the LS motors.

03:28.532 --> 03:30.116

03:30.210 --> 03:32.461
What do you think about putting
something like that engine

03:32.620 --> 03:34.046
into a Cadillac

03:34.205 --> 03:35.872
without having the, like,
Cadillac heartbeat in it?

03:35.965 --> 03:38.133
- It's basically the same thing.

03:38.292 --> 03:40.877
An LS setup in this car,
in my opinion,

03:40.962 --> 03:42.796
is the way to go.

03:42.889 --> 03:46.225
You can easily
get full 450, 500 horsepower

03:46.384 --> 03:48.393
out of an LS engine
and drive it every day.

03:48.552 --> 03:49.886
- I like it.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.813
- And it's never
gonna misbehave on you.

03:51.973 --> 03:53.398
You'll have tons of horsepower.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.725
You'll have tons
of dependability.

03:55.810 --> 03:57.477
If this was mine,
that's what I'd do.

03:57.561 --> 03:59.229
- All right,
that's what I like to here.

03:59.313 --> 04:00.730
That's why I'm here.
- Awesome. Awesome.

04:00.815 --> 04:01.648
That's what I would do.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.066
I got a pretty good idea

04:03.150 --> 04:06.078
as to mechanically
what all we got to do.

04:06.162 --> 04:09.581
So I want to get in your brain,
and tell me, what do you see?

04:09.740 --> 04:12.251
- Black, not gloss black,
but maybe, you know,

04:12.335 --> 04:13.910
some kind of a matte,
maybe a little bit of--

04:13.995 --> 04:15.328
- A little satin.
- Yeah.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.914
I see old-school flames.
- Okay, all the way down?

04:17.999 --> 04:20.759
I mean, this car's a mile long,
so we should go for it, man.

04:20.918 --> 04:22.502
- You think flames all the way
or just the front?

04:22.595 --> 04:23.920
- I'd go all the way.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.347
- You would? Okay.
- Yeah.

04:25.506 --> 04:27.590
To me, there's a way
to go all the way

04:27.675 --> 04:29.434
without doing too much.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.595
So you can do more
going on up here.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.190
And then if it just starts
to taper down, it...

04:35.275 --> 04:36.599
- I like that.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.193
- Accentuates the length
of the car.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.686
- Yeah. I can see it.

04:39.770 --> 04:41.521
- But yet it's still satin
black car with flames,

04:41.614 --> 04:43.273
as opposed to it just
being covered in the turquoise.

04:43.357 --> 04:44.783
It'd be gorgeous.

04:44.942 --> 04:45.951
- Yeah.
That's what I'm thinking.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.536

04:47.695 --> 04:50.038

the question of the day--

04:50.123 --> 04:53.292
Obviously I'm the business guy.
- I see it coming.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.369
- So what kind of budget
are you thinking?

04:56.454 --> 04:57.954
- I think my top number
would be 80,000, all righ?

04:58.039 --> 04:59.289
- Okay.

04:59.373 --> 05:00.882
- If I could come in around
75,000...

05:01.042 --> 05:02.217

05:02.302 --> 05:03.802

08:11.398 --> 08:12.649
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

08:12.733 --> 08:15.827
- What I was thinking
is a white Indian,

08:15.986 --> 08:19.080
if you can do
the white Indian headdress,

08:19.165 --> 08:20.490
and I'm an army aviator.
- Okay.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.502
- So what I'd like
on that Indian

08:23.661 --> 08:26.922
is a set of goggles
and a little scarf.

08:27.006 --> 08:30.416
- Yes.
- You know, whatever colo,

08:30.501 --> 08:31.760
you know, red, white,
blue kind of thing...

08:31.919 --> 08:33.345

going with that.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.930
- Whatever you think looks best.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.339
- Absolutely.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.933

look really cool.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.267
- I like that.

08:39.426 --> 08:41.010
- And one more thing--
- Huh?

08:41.095 --> 08:42.762
- Nothing gets taken off
as far as, like,

08:42.855 --> 08:45.598
all your badging and stuff,
just the gas tank?

08:45.683 --> 08:47.359
- Yeah. I'd like to leave it
all chromed up.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.694
- With the classic design
we're gonna do and the colors

08:49.853 --> 08:51.446
and everything,
the more chrome, the better.

08:51.605 --> 08:52.855
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.115
- You know, it's not every day

08:54.200 --> 08:55.784
that we get to work
on an Indian motorcycle,

08:55.868 --> 08:57.702
and it's actually nice to do
something a little differen,

08:57.861 --> 08:59.538
especially when the client
has a clear vision

08:59.697 --> 09:01.030

09:01.123 --> 09:02.699

is to show it to you.

10:13.687 --> 10:15.280
These floor pans were gone,

that's all been cut out,

10:17.283 --> 10:18.700

it just goes on from there.

it's just toast,
I mean, throughout.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.797

32:55.881 --> 32:58.883
So I flew helicopters

patriotic," right?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.515
When it comes to satins,
there's no touching up.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.851
No buffing, there's only
sand it and redo it.

40:46.935 --> 40:48.111
- Yeah.

40:48.195 --> 40:50.029
Could not ask for anything more.

40:50.189 --> 40:51.939
You absolutely brought it right
out of my head and nailed it,

40:52.024 --> 40:53.107
and I really appreciate it.

40:53.192 --> 40:54.192
- Cool.
- Let's do this.

40:54.276 --> 40:55.618
- Tell me.
- Come with me.

40:55.703 --> 40:57.278
Come with me, you two.
- All right.

40:57.362 --> 40:59.372
- I just want
to soak it up for a minute

40:59.457 --> 41:00.957
and look at this insane machine.

41:01.116 --> 41:04.118
- It's got everything
that I could possibly want

41:04.203 --> 41:06.463
and more, amplified, right?

41:06.547 --> 41:08.623
Like, it's aggressive.

41:08.707 --> 41:12.051
It's mean but classy
at the same time.

41:12.136 --> 41:15.054
This car's perfect. It's me.
It's everything that I am.

41:15.139 --> 41:17.974
- That's all I needed to hear,
'cause...

41:18.133 --> 41:20.885
Let's go do some paperwork.
- Oh, man! Come on!

41:20.969 --> 41:23.062
- Mike Finn is a cool guy, man.

41:23.147 --> 41:26.307
So of course we had to build
a car worthy of its owner.

41:26.391 --> 41:28.651
The initial metalwork
on this thing was a challenge,

41:28.736 --> 41:31.062
but we were rewarded
when Mike upped the budget

41:31.146 --> 41:34.073
so we can build a true
show-quality Cadillac.

41:34.233 --> 41:35.733
<i>I think it's safe to say</i>

41:35.817 --> 41:37.744
<i>that Mike is really happy
with his decision.</i>

41:37.828 --> 41:41.247
Man, my guys killed it--Mike's
dream Caddy is a reality,

41:41.332 --> 41:44.325
and that, my friends,
is a job well done.

41:44.409 --> 41:46.494
