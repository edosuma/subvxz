- Police scanner.

- Well, who reported it?
- Some hiker named Buzz.

Oh, no. It's real, all right.
There's corroboration.

a family that was camping...

04:37.676 --> 04:40.737
and a fly fisherman
by the name of Rocky Calhoun.

- No.
- Well, how big was it?

05:07.740 --> 05:10.835

How long did it last?

- Of course not.
- You know what they do with those people?

05:18.617 --> 05:20.949
They lock them up tight
in the loony bin.

about that, Rocky.

- You mind if I call you Rocky?
- Everyone does.

05:27.559 --> 05:32.326
Look, Sheriff, there's been dry lightning
all over these woods for days.

05:32.398 --> 05:35.026
Did this look like
dry lightning to you, Rocky?

05:38.303 --> 05:40.294
All right.

07:09.661 --> 07:11.993

make a commitment.

07:16.735 --> 07:19.932

at the art house theater
this Friday night.

08:24.203 --> 08:27.298
I wanted to know if maybe
you wanted to, uh, go.

08:27.372 --> 08:30.000
No, I'm not really into that.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.506

<i>Told you that place
would get to you.</i>

09:00.305 --> 09:02.399

09:02.474 --> 09:04.943
- Five basket cases.
- Then why has Valenti already closed off...

09:05.010 --> 09:09.709
a four-square-mile area of the forest
near the Indian reservation?

09:09.781 --> 09:12.580
You mean near the cave?

09:12.651 --> 09:14.881
- Max, you don't think this sighting-
- <i>It</i> was n0 <i>coincidence.</i>

09:14.953 --> 09:18.184
So we need to get there before Valenti does
in case there's something to find.

09:18.257 --> 09:20.385
We don't know how many guys
he has patrolling.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.894

just make him more curious.

09:22.961 --> 09:25.726
What do you do
in Frazier Woods?

09:25.797 --> 09:29.358
You hike, you fish, you camp out.

gonna suggest this, but...

09:32.537 --> 09:36.633
- we could go on that camping trip this
weekend. - You're kidding me, right?

09:36.708 --> 09:40.201
If anybody found us, we would just be
kids missing from our school group.

09:40.279 --> 09:44.978
There's only one problem:
It's a fathers' weekend.

09:45.050 --> 09:47.576

- Yeah, like you care.

- See what?

11:46.338 --> 11:49.103
It was real.

What was-

11:54.513 --> 11:57.210
The sighting.

How do you know?

grossly overrated myself.

12:42.294 --> 12:44.922
And he has been getting so nosy lately.

It's like he wants to know
like every single detail of my life.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.801
He even asked me about
Max and Michael and Isabel.

12:50.869 --> 12:55.397

13:08.553 --> 13:12.217
and then I'll do your math homework
for an entire week.

13:12.290 --> 13:14.224
You're good.

13:16.995 --> 13:19.794
- [ Sneezes]
- Ooh.

13:19.865 --> 13:23.665
Hey, I brought you some more echinacea
and threw in a little goldenseal too.

13:23.735 --> 13:25.669
The bus leaves at 5:00.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.517
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

13:47.959 --> 13:49.893
Here's your root beer, son.

13:49.961 --> 13:52.453
- Hanson, I'm 16.
- I'm sorry.

13:52.531 --> 13:56.161
Here's your root beer, sir.
You sure you want to wait?

13:56.234 --> 13:58.168
He knows we've got
to get a new tent.

13:58.236 --> 14:00.705
- He told me to meet him here 15 minutes ago.
- It's been crazy around here.

14:00.772 --> 14:04.970
You know, the sighting.
He is a walking bundle of stress.

14:05.043 --> 14:08.104
- <i>That's my dad.</i>
- <i>[ Valenti] Hanson!</i>

14:09.548 --> 14:12.313
Coffee.
That son of a bitch hiker.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.318
He spilled his guts
to the Roswell Gazette.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.787
USA <i>Today</i> picked it up off the wire.

14:16.855 --> 14:19.790
Now Rocky's negotiating with <i>Dateline.</i>

14:19.858 --> 14:21.792
Hey, Kyle.

14:21.860 --> 14:25.455
<i>I guess that means you won't be returning
Agent Stevens's call first thing?</i>

14:25.530 --> 14:27.692
Get Miller on the phone.
Tell him to rush the search.

14:27.766 --> 14:29.700
I want every inch
of that woods combed...

14:29.768 --> 14:32.135
before Agent Stevens sends
his “Feebee“ goons out there.

14:36.074 --> 14:38.008
Shouldn't you be
in school or something?

14:38.076 --> 14:41.410
I have third period free,
remember?

14:41.479 --> 14:44.244
We have exactly 36 minutes
to buy this tent...

14:44.316 --> 14:46.683
unless something more important
has come up.

14:46.751 --> 14:51.848
- Oh. Listen, Kyle, about this weekend-
- You mean fathers' weekend?

14:51.923 --> 14:55.382
- The only two clays in a row we
spend together all year? - Yeah.

14:55.460 --> 14:59.397
- You know, I wouldn't do this if it wasn't
an emergency. - What's the emergency?

14:59.464 --> 15:03.401
Come on, you can tell me.
I'm family, right? Is it the big invasion?

15:04.436 --> 15:06.370
<i>Mayor Higgins on the line, sir.</i>

15:06.438 --> 15:09.408
I'll be right there.
Look, Kyle...

15:09.474 --> 15:11.966
I don't know what this is yet...

15:12.043 --> 15:14.671
but I can't have anybody else
find out first.

15:14.746 --> 15:17.681
You can't or you won't?

15:18.917 --> 15:21.887
I tell you what.
You go on ahead without me.

15:21.953 --> 15:25.548
I'll call Coach Clay. I'll make sure
he takes care of you out there.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.150
Thanks for your effort.

15:28.226 --> 15:30.627
See you on Monday.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.059
So River Dog saw the light.

15:36.134 --> 15:38.535
<i>- The Dog himself.</i>
- <i>[ Isabel jAnd he said/t was real?</i>

15:38.603 --> 15:41.834
- You know what this could mean?
- Our first real proof.

15:41.906 --> 15:43.840
Could even lead to actual contact.

15:43.908 --> 15:47.276
- If we haven't had it already.
- What do you mean?

15:47.345 --> 15:49.939
Why is River Dog following me?
Why does he care?

15:50.015 --> 15:52.245
Because he knew the fourth alien.

15:52.317 --> 15:56.777
- Yeah, that's what he said.
- And you don't believe him.

15:56.855 --> 15:59.922
How does he know so much?
How did he know to heal me when I was sick?

15:59.923 --> 15:59.946
How does he know so much?
How did he know to heal me when I was sick?

16:00.056 --> 16:02.286
<i>I mean, that's some memory
from when he was a kid.</i>

16:02.358 --> 16:04.759
And where'd he get those stones from?

16:04.827 --> 16:07.455
Maybe River Dog's the guy
we've been looking for all along.

16:10.300 --> 16:15.101
- The fourth alien.
- I think he's our father, Maxwell.

16:16.506 --> 16:20.500
- Michael, I don't think so.
- Why, because you and Max already have one?

16:20.576 --> 16:22.305
No, that's not what I'm trying to say-

16:22.378 --> 16:25.143
River Dog knows more about us
than Philip Evans ever will...

16:25.214 --> 16:28.479
no matter how many
camping trips you guys take.

16:31.187 --> 16:33.986
Okay, okay, okay,
is she looking at me?

16:34.057 --> 16:37.425
<i>Oh. Um, she's not--</i>

16:37.493 --> 16:39.484
she's not really looking at you.

16:39.562 --> 16:41.621
Isabel Evans and Alex Charles Whitman
out on a date?

16:41.698 --> 16:44.065
That's like so miraculous, you know.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.330
This is the biggest moment
of Alex Charles Whitman's life.

16:47.403 --> 16:49.371
- Why don't you take some deep breaths, okay?
- [ Exhales]

16:49.439 --> 16:53.307
It'sjust- It's amazing, you know?
It's totally amazing.

16:53.376 --> 16:56.471
It's- It's too amazing.

16:56.546 --> 16:59.277
Oh, God!
It's a joke, isn't it?

16:59.349 --> 17:01.647
It's a practical joke.
You two are in on it.

17:01.718 --> 17:04.585
- You bastards.
- Alex, Alex, Alex.

17:04.654 --> 17:07.146
Your paranoid schizophrenia,
it's kicking in.

17:07.223 --> 17:09.453
Right.

17:09.525 --> 17:12.324
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and go have a little talk with myself.

17:12.395 --> 17:14.329
Okay.

17:16.531 --> 17:18.329
See what I'm saying?

17:18.401 --> 17:21.701
These Czechoslovakians have
way too weird ofan effect on us.

17:21.771 --> 17:23.796
If you don't stay away from them,
I'm gonna be picking up...

17:23.873 --> 17:26.171
the pieces of your heart
for the rest of your life.

17:26.242 --> 17:30.201
No, you're not, because I am
staying away from him, Maria.

17:30.279 --> 17:32.748
Max and I haven't even
talked to each other for days.

17:32.815 --> 17:34.715
- Really?
- Yes.

17:34.784 --> 17:38.584
- Then why has he been staring at
you since he came in? - He has?

17:38.654 --> 17:40.588
[Sighs]

17:46.295 --> 17:48.320
Am I gonna have to do
an intervention with you?

17:48.398 --> 17:52.164
Liz, make him think that you are over him,
that your life is so exciting.

17:52.235 --> 17:54.363
Lie if you have to.
It's for your own good.

17:55.638 --> 17:58.767
- H6)!-
- H6)!-

17:58.841 --> 18:02.004
Um, thanks.

18:02.078 --> 18:03.876
Haven't seen you in a couple of days.

18:03.946 --> 18:05.914
Uh, yeah. It's been kind of busy.

18:07.650 --> 18:09.584
She means she's been kind of busy.

18:09.652 --> 18:12.212
Actually, we've both been kind of busy.

18:12.288 --> 18:14.086
Yeah, I can see that.

18:14.157 --> 18:17.923
[Sighs ] You know, getting ready
for the big weekend and all.

18:17.994 --> 18:20.292
You have a big weekend?

18:20.363 --> 18:22.923
Dates. We have dates.

18:22.999 --> 18:25.866
- With men.
- Men?

18:25.935 --> 18:29.735
These college guys that we met
during winter break...

18:29.806 --> 18:33.299
<i>and they're taking us out for dinner--
an expensive dinner.</i>

18:34.811 --> 18:38.042
Great. Well, have a good time.

18:45.188 --> 18:49.056
- Maria, I know you'rejust trying
to be helpful, but- - But nothing.

18:49.125 --> 18:52.789
Liz, trust me.
It's for your own good, okay?

18:54.197 --> 18:56.928
- Yeah.
- Oh, great.

18:58.334 --> 18:59.733
So, lsabel-

18:59.802 --> 19:03.067
Another one being
sucked into the alien abyss.

19:03.139 --> 19:06.131
- Listen, about our plans for tonight-
- Oh, God.

19:06.209 --> 19:09.941
Alex, I'm so sorry. My dad is insisting
we go on this lame camping trip together.

19:10.012 --> 19:14.279
- I have to cancel.
- Cancel?

19:14.350 --> 19:16.614
- Yeah. <i>I'm really sorry.</i>
- <i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

19:16.686 --> 19:19.246
Not at all.
Don't worry about it.

19:19.322 --> 19:23.782
It's funny, because I was just about to
tell you that I was gonna have to cancel...

19:23.860 --> 19:27.455
because of this fathers'
camping weekend fiesta.

19:27.530 --> 19:30.522
I mean,you know how
dads can be sometimes.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.535
You're going camping?

19:33.603 --> 19:37.130
- Some coincidence, huh?
- Huh.

19:40.977 --> 19:46.347
Pop! Let me go get my dad,
and then I'll get the tags for that. Pop!

19:46.415 --> 19:50.443
Hey, I'm glad you could make it
on such short notice.

19:50.520 --> 19:54.047
You sure you wanna do this, Alex?

19:54.123 --> 19:57.957
- Yeah, I'm sure. Come on.
- But we're not really prepared.

19:58.027 --> 20:00.621
Oh, our parkas,
two sleeping bags...

20:00.696 --> 20:03.188
the wind at our backs-
what else do we need?

20:06.169 --> 20:08.866
Are you sure you guys
really want to do this?

20:08.938 --> 20:10.872
We've been looking forward to it.

20:11.941 --> 20:14.069
Yeah, absolutely.

20:14.143 --> 20:17.977
Mosquitoes, pit toilets
and animal droppings. Yes!

20:18.047 --> 20:21.642
Well, I can't say it doesn't make me happy
to see you twojoining in like this.

20:21.717 --> 20:24.948
That's our new policy, Dad.
We'rejoiners.

20:25.021 --> 20:26.989
- Right, Max?
-joiners.

20:27.056 --> 20:29.616
<i>Maria, I am so glad
you're gonna come with us.</i>

20:29.692 --> 20:34.220
- Yeah, me too. - Because there's something
that we should all talk about...

20:34.297 --> 20:36.322
and it'll be good to get away...

20:36.399 --> 20:39.835
<i>- from all the outside influences
thatyouve been... - Oh, my God'.!</i>

20:39.902 --> 20:42.667
distracted by.
What the-

20:42.738 --> 20:44.968
Oh, my God!
[ Panting]

20:45.041 --> 20:47.169
Maria, what am I gonna do?
He's here.

20:47.243 --> 20:50.543
No problem. Let's tell them that
the two college guys had midterms...

20:50.613 --> 20:52.547
and we're gonna meet them
next week in Albuquerque.

20:52.615 --> 20:54.640
Having a life is one thing,
but having a whole fantasy life...

20:54.717 --> 20:56.776
is just a little bit troubling,
don't you think?

20:56.852 --> 21:00.584
<i>[ Man]
Bennett! Butler!</i>

21:00.656 --> 21:03.353
- <i>Hey Valenti!</i>
- <i>Hey, Coach.</i>

21:03.426 --> 21:05.724
I understand we're gonna be
bunking together this trip.

21:05.795 --> 21:07.923
Pinch me.

21:07.997 --> 21:09.761
I'll take it from here, Coach.

21:12.268 --> 21:14.532
- New tent, right?
- Right.

21:16.339 --> 21:18.273
So, I thought you had to work.

21:18.341 --> 21:21.709
They'll get ahold of me if they need to.
I'll go check us in.

21:24.146 --> 21:27.241
Hey. Squeezed another year
out of it, huh?

21:27.316 --> 21:29.876
Oh, yeah. You know,
you're lucky you got a boy.

21:29.952 --> 21:32.785
- Hello, Sheriff.
- Hey.jim.

21:32.855 --> 21:34.789
This weekend ifsjim.

21:34.857 --> 21:37.849
- So, Frazier Woods, huh?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

21:37.927 --> 21:40.328
I don't know about you,
but it makes me a little nervous.

21:40.396 --> 21:42.387
Why? It's a well-marked campsite.

21:42.465 --> 21:45.799
I mean about the sighting.
Isn't it close to where we're going?

21:45.868 --> 21:48.894
It's three, maybe four miles.

21:52.975 --> 21:54.909
It's nothing to worry about.

21:54.977 --> 22:00.575
<i>[Coach Clay]
Coleman! Daskal! Evans!</i>

22:00.650 --> 22:04.086
<i>I don't know what to do.
He's gonna find out.</i>

22:04.153 --> 22:08.181
- They're going alphabetically, Marie.
- Ka/inowski!

22:08.257 --> 22:11.488
<i>Parker! Ferris!</i>

22:11.560 --> 22:13.961
<i>Pullman! Ruhl!</i>

22:14.030 --> 22:16.829
No, uh, expensive dinner?

22:18.067 --> 22:20.502
Actually, there's been a change in plans.

22:23.005 --> 22:26.441
And we were making such progress.

22:26.509 --> 22:29.911
Everyone on the bus, please!
Load up, everyone!

22:29.979 --> 22:31.913
Yeah, it's me.

22:31.981 --> 22:34.279
Tell Miller to put some
extra men on the perimeter.

22:34.350 --> 22:38.287
I think something might happen tonight.
I want to be ready.

22:51.967 --> 22:55.961
Hey, hey.
This looks like a good one.

22:56.038 --> 22:59.030
What about over there?
It's closer to the trees.

22:59.108 --> 23:01.668
Oh. Good call.

23:09.418 --> 23:12.615
It'll be easier to get away
if we're near the woods.

23:14.623 --> 23:16.614
This is crazy, Max.
Valenti is right here.

23:16.692 --> 23:19.491
That's exactly why
we have to do this, Isabel.

23:19.562 --> 23:24.557
If that sighting is real and there is something
out there, then we have to find it first.

23:26.035 --> 23:28.003
We have no choice.

23:28.070 --> 23:31.165
I'm gonna break the all-time record.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.641
Last year I ate five bratwurst.

23:33.709 --> 23:35.905
<i>This year I'm gonna eat six.</i>

23:37.213 --> 23:39.147
How about you?

23:40.549 --> 23:42.847
Dad.

23:42.918 --> 23:44.977
Focus. Son.

23:45.054 --> 23:46.988
Sorry, Kyle.
What were you asking?

23:47.056 --> 23:50.185
What is that?
What are you doing?

23:50.259 --> 23:52.694
I promised Miller
I'd stay in touch tonight.

23:52.762 --> 23:55.993
<i>You know what?
The reception's low in this area.</i>

23:56.065 --> 23:58.659
- Let's try a different site.
- But I picked this one.

23:58.734 --> 24:00.896
- Kyle.
_ l__

24:02.037 --> 24:04.165
Hey, look at us.
We're campin'.

24:05.641 --> 24:07.575
Hey-

24:08.644 --> 24:10.806
Okay, here we go.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.144
Now we're ready
to have some fun.

24:22.725 --> 24:24.716
Bingo. Reception.

24:26.429 --> 24:29.091
Hey, you got space
for a few more around here?

24:37.139 --> 24:39.039
This'll do just fine, son.

24:41.510 --> 24:44.810
<i>Jeff? Over here. Come on.
We'll make a party of it.</i>

24:46.449 --> 24:48.417
[Both] I don't think
that's such a good idea.

24:50.853 --> 24:54.790
Look, there's Alex. Come on, it'll be fun.
I can get to know your friends.

25:02.832 --> 25:07.429
That summer, they found five cows
all mutilated with surgical precision...

25:07.503 --> 25:09.904
on Hattie Wexlefs farm.

25:09.972 --> 25:11.906
When she died two months later,
they did an autopsy.

25:11.974 --> 25:14.272
Sure enough, they found
perfectly bored holes in her skull...

25:14.343 --> 25:18.177
just where she claims the aliens made them
when they abducted her that night.

25:18.247 --> 25:23.276
That skull is now buried deep
somewhere within Area 51.

25:23.352 --> 25:25.650
Got 'em on the edge of their seats, son.

25:25.721 --> 25:29.248
- Where'd you hear that?
- It's one of Grandpa's favorite ones, isn't it?

25:33.496 --> 25:36.329
I'll seeyour nickel
and raise you a quarter.

25:38.534 --> 25:41.868
I fold. I know better.

25:41.937 --> 25:44.031
Too rich for my blood.

25:46.141 --> 25:49.702
What are you hidin', Max?
Got some power over these guys...

25:49.778 --> 25:51.837
makes 'em do exactly what you want?

25:56.952 --> 26:00.286
