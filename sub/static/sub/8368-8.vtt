You have
a perfect ensemble here.

00:02.112 --> 00:04.948
They have such bizarre coloring.

00:04.982 --> 00:06.816
Spectacular.

00:06.850 --> 00:08.317
Thank you.

<i>McKenzie: And tonight,

00:17.995 --> 00:19.796

and mirrors.</i>

00:19.830 --> 00:22.599

- Wow.

00:22.633 --> 00:24.000
This is fun.

00:24.034 --> 00:25.368
That does not read female.

00:25.402 --> 00:26.803
- No.
- I am freaking out.

00:26.837 --> 00:29.739
This is taking me forever.
I can't just have a cowl.

00:29.773 --> 00:31.608
Not gonna have enough time
to sculpt a face.

00:33.244 --> 00:34.377
It's just gorgeous.

00:34.411 --> 00:36.045
It doesn't hold up as a whole.

Dragons, anyone?
That'd be cool.

01:53.023 --> 01:54.991
<i>It's really big,
and it's really old-looking.</i>

01:55.025 --> 01:58.394
I'm hoping it's dragons,
because it's a castle.

01:58.429 --> 02:00.496
Castles and dragons.
That's a thing.

02:05.069 --> 02:07.036
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, McKenzie.

02:07.071 --> 02:09.405
Welcome to the incredible
Lobo Castle.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.507
It's beautiful, isn't it?

02:11.542 --> 02:12.642
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah, beautiful.

02:12.676 --> 02:15.044
Well, as you all know,
looks can be deceiving.

02:15.079 --> 02:18.147
Now, while this castle home
is stunning,

02:18.182 --> 02:19.882
<i>sometimes exterior beauty</i>

02:19.917 --> 02:21.918
is nothing more than a façade.

02:26.490 --> 02:27.724
Ooh.

02:33.897 --> 02:36.332
<i>All these models come out,
and they're very different.</i>

02:36.367 --> 02:38.334
I start thinking "fantasy."

02:38.369 --> 02:39.969
<i>And I love fantasy,</i>

02:40.003 --> 02:41.971
<i>so I'm excited
for this challenge.</i>

02:42.005 --> 02:43.139
It's gonna be fun.

02:43.173 --> 02:44.674
- Wow.
- This is fun.

02:46.143 --> 02:48.411
As you can see,
our evil sorceresses

02:48.445 --> 02:50.580
are all young and beautiful...

02:50.614 --> 02:52.782
a façade
that is clearly the result

02:52.816 --> 02:54.884
of their magical powers.

02:54.918 --> 02:56.185
So, for this week's

02:56.220 --> 02:58.988
Spotlight Challenge, you
will choose one of these models

02:59.022 --> 03:02.992
and turn her into the monstrous
or hideous evil sorceress

03:03.026 --> 03:07.296
she truly is
when all that magic wears off.

03:07.331 --> 03:09.699
My genre is scary beautiful,

03:09.733 --> 03:12.969
so this challenge
is a perfect match.

03:13.003 --> 03:15.338
All right, it's time
to pick your evil sorceress.

03:15.372 --> 03:17.240
We've drawn your names
at random.

03:17.274 --> 03:19.242
Rob, you have first pick.

03:19.276 --> 03:20.777
The dragon queen.

03:20.811 --> 03:22.078
Corpse conjurer.

03:22.112 --> 03:23.813
The Wiccan of the woods.

03:23.847 --> 03:25.348
Shadow enchantress.

03:25.382 --> 03:27.083
Sea witch.

03:27.117 --> 03:29.051
Temptress of the flame.

03:29.086 --> 03:31.721
Emerald empress.

03:31.755 --> 03:33.790
All right, now, keep in mind
that the judges

03:33.824 --> 03:37.660
expect to see your sorceress's
true evil nature

03:37.694 --> 03:39.529
on full display
at the reveal stage.

03:39.563 --> 03:40.863
Good luck.

03:40.898 --> 03:41.898
Thank you.

03:47.671 --> 03:51.007
I couldn't be more excited
because I got my dragon queen.

03:51.041 --> 03:54.811
You lure younger girls
to live in your castle

03:54.845 --> 03:56.012
and then you steal their youth.

03:56.046 --> 03:58.614
I want to stick with the colors
of her dress,

03:58.649 --> 04:01.617
<i>so it's a lot
of tans and browns and golds.</i>

04:01.652 --> 04:03.753
Those colors
scream "dragon" to me.

04:03.787 --> 04:06.355
So, a lot of scales,
a lot of horns poking out,

04:06.390 --> 04:07.790
old age.

04:07.825 --> 04:10.526
So right now I'm thinking
of doing a face, the back piece,

04:10.561 --> 04:12.161
<i>and maybe some hand appliances.</i>

04:12.196 --> 04:14.630
<i>It's kind of a lot
for one person to do all that,</i>

04:14.665 --> 04:18.267
<i>so hopefully I can get
it all done.</i>

04:18.302 --> 04:19.802
One, two, three.

04:19.837 --> 04:22.338
<i>I end up with one of the ones
I really didn't want...</i>

04:22.372 --> 04:23.940
the emerald empress.

04:23.974 --> 04:27.543
<i>I don't know how to incorporate
emeralds in a hideous creature.</i>

04:27.578 --> 04:29.278
<i>I really got to think
about this one</i>

04:29.313 --> 04:32.949
and pull from things I know
to come up with a cool concept.

04:37.387 --> 04:39.956
<i>My character is the Wiccan
of the woods,</i>

04:39.990 --> 04:41.657
<i>and in Wicca and witchcraft,</i>

04:41.692 --> 04:44.327
a common theme is
that when you send out a spell,

04:44.361 --> 04:45.862
it comes back times three.

04:45.896 --> 04:48.998
<i>So this beautiful witch</i>

04:49.032 --> 04:51.567
<i>is the character
who sends out the spell,</i>

04:51.602 --> 04:53.269
but if you send out
an evil spell,

04:53.303 --> 04:56.606
she comes back in her true form
to exact vengeance.

05:00.344 --> 05:02.745
I want to incorporate trees
and bark

05:02.779 --> 05:04.380
<i>and some element of decay,</i>

05:04.414 --> 05:07.550
<i>and I want to make her overall
sculpt very asymmetrical,</i>

05:07.584 --> 05:10.019
<i>like a tree choked by burls
and vines.</i>

05:10.053 --> 05:13.189
<i>I have not sculpted a cowl yet
for the competition on my own,</i>

05:13.223 --> 05:15.658
<i>but I think if I pace
myself correctly with the time,</i>

05:15.692 --> 05:17.326
I should be able
to knock everything out.

05:25.435 --> 05:28.638
The sorceress I pick
is the temptress of flame.

05:28.672 --> 05:31.941
<i>She works with Satan
by manifesting things</i>

05:31.975 --> 05:34.043
<i>people are tempted by,</i>

05:34.077 --> 05:36.279
and if they don't give in
to temptation, they're fine.

05:36.313 --> 05:38.314
But if they do, they get burned.

05:38.348 --> 05:41.751
<i>I'm thinking of putting
the flames on these ram horns.</i>

05:41.785 --> 05:44.420
<i>The only thing that's causing
me stress about this makeup</i>

05:44.454 --> 05:47.924
<i>is sculpting the flames in a
way that doesn't look cartoony.</i>

05:47.958 --> 05:49.292
<i>I definitely want the silhouette</i>

05:49.326 --> 05:51.260
<i>to be a powerful image,</i>

05:51.295 --> 05:53.996
and I just hope
I can get it in clay.

06:00.571 --> 06:03.072
You're definitely gonna be,
like, scary.

06:03.106 --> 06:05.041
<i>I picked the shadow enchantress.</i>

06:05.075 --> 06:07.009
<i>She is a demon sorceress</i>

06:07.044 --> 06:10.146
that seduces people
into getting what she wants.

06:10.180 --> 06:11.581
<i>It's gonna be a darker makeup.</i>

06:11.615 --> 06:12.815
<i>I want her to have</i>

06:12.849 --> 06:15.117
<i>a hollowed-out face,
sunken-in cheeks.</i>

06:15.152 --> 06:17.920
<i>I want to turn the spikes that
are coming out of her crown</i>

06:17.955 --> 06:19.488
<i>into some sort of horns.</i>

06:19.523 --> 06:21.023
So I have a lot
of work ahead of me.

06:21.058 --> 06:22.358
Hope this works out.

06:24.061 --> 06:26.362
All right, everybody.
Let's go back to the lab.

06:26.396 --> 06:27.396
All right.

06:38.075 --> 06:39.709
<i>So we get back to the lab,</i>

06:39.743 --> 06:42.311
<i>and I start sculpting
the sea witch.</i>

06:42.346 --> 06:45.982
My sorceress name
is Maris Tenebris,

06:46.016 --> 06:50.786
which is Latin
for "Darkness of the sea."

06:50.821 --> 06:53.723
<i>My concept is to show</i>

06:53.757 --> 06:57.760
<i>like she's transforming
into a fish-like sea creature,</i>

06:57.794 --> 07:01.297
but I'm thinking of just turning
half of her face,

07:01.331 --> 07:03.799
<i>and there's a side
I keep normal.</i>

07:03.834 --> 07:06.769
My sea witch
is pretty in the daytime,

07:06.803 --> 07:09.605
<i>and sailors fell for her,
and then by the time</i>

07:09.640 --> 07:12.074
<i>she shows her real face,
it's already too late.</i>

07:12.109 --> 07:16.545
What she does to them is so
twisted that we can't really

07:16.580 --> 07:18.414
talk about it on television.

07:25.255 --> 07:27.556
<i>I'm still stuck
on this character,</i>

07:27.591 --> 07:29.759
<i>but as I'm looking
at my reference photo,</i>

07:29.793 --> 07:33.529
I realized my model was
already very powerful-looking,

07:33.563 --> 07:36.298
<i>and I want to use her features
to my advantage.</i>

07:36.333 --> 07:39.168
<i>So I'm gonna have emeralds
coming out of her cheeks</i>

07:39.202 --> 07:40.636
<i>following up to her forehead,</i>

07:40.671 --> 07:42.038
<i>emerald shoulder pieces,</i>

07:42.072 --> 07:43.406
<i>and I'm gonna do a crown piece</i>

07:43.440 --> 07:46.175
<i>with the emeralds
shooting out of her skin.</i>

07:46.209 --> 07:48.310
Once I get into it,
I'm really liking this.

07:48.345 --> 07:50.179
And it's something
that I could see as,

07:50.213 --> 07:51.847
like, an action figure.

07:56.586 --> 07:58.954
<i>I am so excited
that I got the corpse conjurer.</i>

07:58.989 --> 08:02.525
My idea is that every time
she conjures the dead,

08:02.559 --> 08:05.861
she turns into a corpse version
of herself.

08:05.896 --> 08:07.830
<i>I want to take her skeletal
system</i>

08:07.864 --> 08:10.399
<i>and make it look like it's
pressing through the skin.</i>

08:10.434 --> 08:13.035
It's like a shape
that's coming out.

08:13.070 --> 08:14.570
It's, like, pushing
through the skin.

08:14.604 --> 08:15.905
- Does that look like that?
- Yeah.

08:15.939 --> 08:17.840
It's gonna be hard
to sculpt without just

08:17.874 --> 08:19.075
turning it into a skull,

08:19.109 --> 08:20.843
<i>but at this point
in the competition,</i>

08:20.877 --> 08:22.278
<i>after finishing the gauntlet,</i>

08:22.312 --> 08:24.647
I'm more confident
in my abilities.

08:30.253 --> 08:31.787
Hey, guys.
Here to check in on you.

08:31.822 --> 08:32.788
- Yay.
- Hello.

08:32.823 --> 08:33.823
- How are ya?
- Hi.

08:33.857 --> 08:36.826
I have the Wiccan of the woods.

08:36.860 --> 08:38.260
I'm trying to, like, yeah,
make it look like

08:38.294 --> 08:39.828
knots and burls
and stuff like that.

08:39.863 --> 08:43.666
What's so important about this
is just not painting them brown.

08:43.700 --> 08:48.738
You're gonna have to go in
and pick up some wood texture.

08:48.772 --> 08:50.840
Otherwise it's gonna
look like brown boils.

08:50.874 --> 08:53.843
- Yeah.
- I got the emerald empress.

08:53.877 --> 08:56.011
<i>Now, are you gonna
use any stones on the face?</i>

08:56.046 --> 08:57.913
I want them to come down
a little bit

08:57.948 --> 08:59.215
up on the higher cheekbone.

08:59.249 --> 09:01.717
These things that are
coming down here on the cheeks

09:01.752 --> 09:06.889
should be more of accents
than trying to do giant things.

09:06.923 --> 09:08.991
You have to be careful
you don't start making

09:09.025 --> 09:10.025
her look like a porcupine.

09:10.060 --> 09:11.026
Yeah.

09:11.061 --> 09:13.763
I want to kind
of keep her pretty,

09:13.797 --> 09:15.531
but scary and disturbing.

09:15.565 --> 09:18.200
Right. I think your nose
is too perfect.

09:18.235 --> 09:19.835
I'd take
and distort that nostril.

09:19.870 --> 09:21.370
You know, like a fish,

09:21.404 --> 09:24.140
a fish is so smooth
around the front of their faces.

09:24.174 --> 09:26.041
But do away with that

09:26.076 --> 09:28.377
and literally bring
this into the face here.

09:28.411 --> 09:29.445
Oh, make it bigger?

09:29.479 --> 09:30.946
Yeah. Yeah.

09:30.981 --> 09:34.016
I got the shadow enchantress.

09:34.050 --> 09:37.286
My model had this really
cool headpiece,

09:37.320 --> 09:40.990
so I thought it would be cool to
have this be a bunch of horns.

09:41.024 --> 09:43.459
Right now,
that looks like a bald cap.

09:43.493 --> 09:46.395
I think you need something
back here, though.

09:46.429 --> 09:49.732
Maybe a ridge
that's going to come down here.

09:49.766 --> 09:52.134
- I like the ridge idea.
- Yeah.

09:52.169 --> 09:54.870
So I got temptress of the flame.

09:54.905 --> 09:56.806
This is gonna be sculpted
into flame.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.407
I'm just working on symmetry
right now.

09:58.441 --> 09:59.809
The shape is really interesting.

09:59.843 --> 10:02.011
- Just don't over-flame it.
- Mm-hmm.

10:02.045 --> 10:04.980
The flame, it's symbolic
as opposed to reality.

10:05.015 --> 10:06.682
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

10:06.716 --> 10:09.285
My sorceress was
the dragon queen.

10:09.319 --> 10:12.822
<i>She's this old, haggard dragon
who steals youth.</i>

10:12.856 --> 10:16.258
I love what you got going on
from here up.

10:16.293 --> 10:17.793
Okay.

10:17.828 --> 10:21.597
This, to me, might look
like a normal old age makeup.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.034
That can be a problem.

10:25.068 --> 10:27.970
Try adding a little fantasy
to it and give her more nostril.

10:28.004 --> 10:30.039
You know, the dragons have the...

10:30.073 --> 10:31.273
- A little more flared?
- Yeah.

10:31.308 --> 10:33.175
- Flared and a little bigger.
- Okay.

10:33.210 --> 10:35.077
Because the ones
you have here are too small.

10:35.111 --> 10:37.413
- Okay.
- Good luck to everybody.

10:37.447 --> 10:38.514
- Thank you.
all: - Bye.

10:41.384 --> 10:44.820
Mr. Westmore's advice
makes me rethink my entire plan.

10:44.855 --> 10:46.322
<i>I'm trying to change the nose</i>

10:46.356 --> 10:49.058
and make it more dragon-y
and fantasy.

10:49.092 --> 10:52.027
<i>But, it's looking really
masculine.</i>

10:52.062 --> 10:53.162
This has to read female,

10:53.196 --> 10:54.530
and right now it
does not read female.

10:54.564 --> 10:56.765
No, it doesn't.

10:56.800 --> 11:00.569
I'm getting really frustrated
and stressed, and every minute

11:00.604 --> 11:02.738
<i>that I spend trying
to make this work,</i>

11:02.772 --> 11:05.174
<i>I'm worrying more and more
about everything else</i>

11:05.208 --> 11:07.243
that I need to get done.

11:07.277 --> 11:09.411
<i>I might have bitten off
more than I can chew,</i>

11:09.446 --> 11:10.846
and I'm freaking out.

11:17.005 --> 11:18.772
<i>I'm spending more time
than I want to</i>

11:18.807 --> 11:20.474
<i>trying to get
this face piece done.</i>

11:20.508 --> 11:22.443
It's not reading
"old dragon lady."

11:22.477 --> 11:23.477
<i>It's reading "old man."</i>

11:23.511 --> 11:25.245
Are there any forms
of her anatomy

11:25.280 --> 11:27.481
that I can just tweak
to make it seem more female?

11:27.515 --> 11:28.515
'Cause I'm lost.

11:28.550 --> 11:30.084
<i>I go over to Anna and Mel,</i>

11:30.118 --> 11:31.385
and sort of ask for help.

11:31.419 --> 11:33.087
You could lessen up this jowl
a little bit.

11:33.121 --> 11:35.489
- Yeah.
- Should I round out the jaw?

11:35.523 --> 11:37.558
Rounder shapes
are gonna be softer, yeah.

11:37.592 --> 11:39.193
Yeah.
It's good advice.

11:39.227 --> 11:43.363
So I knock down the jowls, try
to create a more rounded form,

11:43.398 --> 11:44.698
<i>and it's helping.</i>

11:44.732 --> 11:45.833
I'm still nervous about it,

11:45.867 --> 11:47.534
but I do feel better.

11:47.569 --> 11:49.103
I think you just saved my ass,
Anna.

11:49.137 --> 11:50.104
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:50.138 --> 11:51.705
- Is it working?
- Yeah.

11:58.213 --> 12:00.214
I feel like the sculpture
is progressing nicely,

12:00.248 --> 12:01.915
so it's time to mold.

12:03.518 --> 12:05.652
<i>I'm trying to get
this face ready for foam</i>

12:05.687 --> 12:08.222
so that I can have
a completed face for day two

12:08.256 --> 12:10.491
so I can make sure all the
little vines and everything line

12:10.525 --> 12:11.992
<i>up on the cowl.</i>

12:12.026 --> 12:14.027
<i>I have enough time
to get everything molded,</i>

12:14.062 --> 12:16.830
but whether or not I have time
to clean it out is a question.

12:16.865 --> 12:19.633
<i>So, I'm just trying to get
it done as quickly as possible.</i>

12:23.705 --> 12:24.705
- You gonna go mold?
- Yep.

12:24.739 --> 12:25.739
<i>Whoo-hoo.</i>

12:27.642 --> 12:29.543
I'm trying to figure out
how to make these flames

12:29.577 --> 12:31.612
look realistic and not cartoony,

12:31.646 --> 12:33.647
<i>but all the forms
are not what I want,</i>

12:33.681 --> 12:35.482
so Yvonne actually talks to me

12:35.517 --> 12:38.652
about how she's used vacu-form
plastic for flame in the past.

12:38.686 --> 12:40.721
You just got the plastic
and melted it with a heat gun?

12:40.755 --> 12:42.089
Yes.

12:42.123 --> 12:45.459
So, I get some vacu-form
and heat it with a heat gun

12:45.493 --> 12:48.595
<i>and bend it in a way to create
watery-looking flame shapes</i>

12:48.630 --> 12:50.330
that I couldn't have created
on my own.

12:50.365 --> 12:51.865
- Anna.
- What?

12:51.900 --> 12:52.966
Just like fire.

12:53.001 --> 12:54.134
[laughter]

12:54.169 --> 12:56.170
At first, it's not working.

12:56.204 --> 12:57.938
Yeah.
This is not great.

12:57.972 --> 13:01.441
But eventually I land
on something that looks organic.

13:01.476 --> 13:04.511
It's not perfect, but I'm happy
with what's happening.

13:04.546 --> 13:07.548
- Does that look like fuego?
- Yeah, totally.

13:07.582 --> 13:08.949
It looks sweet as hell.

13:14.856 --> 13:16.256
This was fun to sculpt.

13:16.291 --> 13:18.659
I'm pretty much done
with my cowl.

13:18.693 --> 13:20.861
<i>I do have to do
some detailing tomorrow,</i>

13:20.895 --> 13:22.896
<i>but other than that,
by the end of the day,</i>

13:22.931 --> 13:24.965
I'm exactly where I need to be.

13:24.999 --> 13:26.466
That's time, everyone.

13:29.337 --> 13:30.871
Are you serious?

13:30.905 --> 13:32.206
<i>It's my first cowl</i>

13:32.240 --> 13:34.408
and face sculpt
of this competition on my own,

13:34.442 --> 13:36.476
so time management
is super important.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.712
<i>But I'm headed
in a good direction,</i>

13:38.746 --> 13:40.447
<i>so as long as I stay on track,</i>

13:40.481 --> 13:42.182
<i>I should be
in a totally good spot.</i>

13:52.026 --> 13:54.695
- Okay.
- Let's rock and roll.

13:54.729 --> 13:56.096
Hello.

13:56.130 --> 13:59.566
I have to finish sculpting
and mold everything.

13:59.601 --> 14:01.568
I think yesterday
I had too many ideas,

14:01.603 --> 14:03.637
and I was confusing myself.

14:03.671 --> 14:06.607
That's how I feel every day.

14:06.641 --> 14:08.809
I think yesterday
I was really scatterbrained,

14:08.843 --> 14:10.944
<i>and I was mixing myself
up trying</i>

14:10.979 --> 14:13.180
<i>to do everything all at once.</i>

14:13.214 --> 14:14.915
So, I'm hoping today
is different,

14:14.949 --> 14:17.985
and I really need to focus
and get things done.

14:18.019 --> 14:19.720
<i>The first thing
I do is redo the back.</i>

14:19.754 --> 14:21.655
<i>Instead of doing dragon wings,</i>

14:21.689 --> 14:24.558
<i>I decide to go with more
of an exaggerated spine.</i>

14:24.592 --> 14:26.526
It's only a one piece mold,
and it won't take that long,

14:26.561 --> 14:28.262
so I can spend my time
sculpting.

14:34.102 --> 14:35.736
<i>I'm excited
and a little intimidated,</i>

14:35.770 --> 14:39.206
since I do have to sculpt
and mold a cowl in one day.

14:39.240 --> 14:42.342
<i>But, luckily, I got my face
piece that I had run.</i>

14:42.377 --> 14:44.678
<i>I'm like, "I can use that
to have a smooth form</i>

14:44.712 --> 14:47.514
as I go from the face sculpt
to the cowl."

14:47.548 --> 14:48.982
<i>This kind of cowl, I think,</i>

14:49.017 --> 14:51.852
<i>in real life would take me
at least a couple weeks to do.</i>

14:51.886 --> 14:54.588
<i>So, just trying
to nail all my ideas, get</i>

14:54.622 --> 14:56.890
<i>it done as quickly as possible,
nail up some textures.</i>

14:56.924 --> 14:58.058
It can be a little rough,

14:58.092 --> 14:59.526
and I'll correct it
in the paint job.

15:06.968 --> 15:09.870
Are you doing the spine
or are you doing this?

15:09.904 --> 15:11.738
Originally it was the spine,
but that doesn't really

15:11.773 --> 15:13.940
make sense to push through.

15:13.975 --> 15:15.275
Wouldn't it?

15:15.310 --> 15:16.877
<i>I'm struggling with the neck
a little bit</i>

15:16.911 --> 15:19.446
<i>because I'm not sure if I want
the neck muscles to come out</i>

15:19.480 --> 15:21.381
or if I want more
of the skeleton

15:21.416 --> 15:22.816
from behind the neck
to come out.

15:22.850 --> 15:24.017
It might be kind of cool

15:24.052 --> 15:28.689
if you mimic these sort
of shapes.

15:28.723 --> 15:29.956
Mimicking that more than this?

15:29.991 --> 15:32.626
Like, sort of the little
vertebrae or whatever.

15:32.660 --> 15:35.128
Even if it's, like,
a light impression of it.

15:35.163 --> 15:36.963
Rather than it's like a limbo
between the two?

15:36.998 --> 15:37.964
Yeah.

15:37.999 --> 15:39.633
I really need this to be
accurate

15:39.667 --> 15:41.601
<i>and read as proper anatomy.</i>

15:41.636 --> 15:45.305
<i>So I exaggerate the neck bones
a little bit more.</i>

15:45.340 --> 15:46.473
I'm happy enough.

15:46.507 --> 15:48.742
I'm still not 100%
satisfied with the neck,

15:48.776 --> 15:51.111
but I just have to get it off
to the mold room.

15:52.647 --> 15:53.814
- Rob.
- Hmm?

15:53.848 --> 15:56.483
Do you think
it would be better if I ran it

15:56.517 --> 15:57.851
across the back?

15:57.885 --> 15:59.653
So, I finish my shoulder pieces,

15:59.687 --> 16:01.521
<i>but it's gonna be a tricky mold,</i>

16:01.556 --> 16:04.057
and I'm not exactly sure
how I'm gonna do it.

16:04.092 --> 16:05.792
The thing is,
there's no under cup.

16:05.827 --> 16:08.962
- You would do a cup, then?
- Yes.

16:08.996 --> 16:11.331
Rob suggests
that I just make it like a pod

16:11.366 --> 16:13.900
<i>that is just a one piece
that goes over the shoulders.</i>

16:13.935 --> 16:15.035
<i>So, never done that before.</i>

16:15.069 --> 16:16.169
I'm gonna give it a try.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.955
This mold is taking me forever.

16:34.989 --> 16:38.258
This mold is bigger
than I anticipated it to be.

16:38.292 --> 16:40.494
It's not really setting up
quickly,

16:40.528 --> 16:42.963
and it's taking far too long.

16:42.997 --> 16:44.197
I'm scared
I'm not gonna have enough time

16:44.232 --> 16:46.400
to sculpt and mold a face.

16:46.434 --> 16:49.669
I'm concerned that I haven't
started sculpting my face yet.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.905
There's not
that much time left today,

16:51.939 --> 16:54.508
<i>and I think I might be
in trouble.</i>

16:54.542 --> 16:56.676
Why is this mold
taking me so long?

16:56.711 --> 16:59.846
I don't want to put just a cowl
out in front of the judges,

16:59.881 --> 17:02.416
especially looking
around, and the other artists

17:02.450 --> 17:04.684
<i>are doing cowls, faces,</i>

17:04.719 --> 17:06.653
<i>and Rob's doing an entire body.</i>

17:06.686 --> 17:09.423
So, I can't just have a cowl.

17:09.457 --> 17:11.191
<i>I'm really feeling the pressure.</i>

17:16.756 --> 17:18.189
I'm scared
I'm not gonna have enough time

17:18.223 --> 17:20.391
to sculpt and mold a face.

17:20.425 --> 17:22.727
I'm spending way too long
on this cowl mold.

17:22.762 --> 17:24.128
I just have to call it quits

17:24.163 --> 17:25.997
and hope that it doesn't break
when I open it.

17:27.165 --> 17:29.567
This is going to be
the fastest face sculpt

17:29.602 --> 17:30.835
<i>I've ever done in my life.</i>

17:30.870 --> 17:33.104
But I have to have a face
for this makeup,

17:33.139 --> 17:34.773
or else
my whole concept is shot.

17:38.678 --> 17:40.812
<i>I want to make a eel
for my sorceress,</i>

17:40.846 --> 17:42.881
which she can then wrap
around her arm.

17:42.915 --> 17:44.149
What are you gonna
run that out of?

17:44.183 --> 17:46.284
- Gelatin.
- Gelatin?

17:46.319 --> 17:47.919
It's gonna be gross.

17:47.954 --> 17:48.987
Yeah.

17:49.021 --> 17:51.056
Gelatin is translucent,

17:51.090 --> 17:54.125
and it looks very eel-like
normally.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.027
<i>So, when my mold is ready to go,</i>

17:56.062 --> 17:59.331
I mix some color
into the gelatin

17:59.365 --> 18:00.765
<i>so I don't have to paint it.</i>

18:00.800 --> 18:03.635
<i>Pour it in and then hopefully
it comes out tomorrow.</i>

18:03.669 --> 18:04.769
Okay.

18:10.710 --> 18:13.011
I want to start
knocking out these vines.

18:13.045 --> 18:14.379
<i>I grab some foam tubing.</i>

18:14.413 --> 18:16.681
<i>I start snipping in
to create little thorns,</i>

18:16.716 --> 18:18.016
<i>and then I heat it up.</i>

18:18.050 --> 18:20.018
<i>And what that does
is it causes it to expand,</i>

18:20.052 --> 18:21.786
<i>and it also
slightly shifts the color</i>

18:21.821 --> 18:24.322
<i>so it looks more dark
and less silvery.</i>

18:24.357 --> 18:26.491
It's pretty much the effect
that I'm looking for.

18:26.525 --> 18:28.827
It's not perfect, but, you know,
given the time I have,

18:28.861 --> 18:29.861
<i>it's pretty damn good.</i>

18:36.769 --> 18:39.771
I'm finally done
with the facial sculpture.

18:39.805 --> 18:41.606
I'm not happy with it,
but if I don't

18:41.641 --> 18:43.742
<i>mold it now,
there's no molding it at all.</i>

18:45.144 --> 18:46.478
<i>30 minutes.</i>

18:51.150 --> 18:52.951
All right.
I'd say you're kind of good.

18:54.353 --> 18:56.154
That's time.

18:56.188 --> 19:00.625
<i>That was the fastest mold
I've made in my life.</i>

19:00.660 --> 19:02.560
I was like, "How am I
gonna deal with Anna tonight

19:02.595 --> 19:04.696
if she doesn't get
that fucking face done?"

19:04.730 --> 19:06.965
These were not the best molds
I ever made.

19:06.999 --> 19:08.566
<i>I hope my foam turns out.</i>

19:08.601 --> 19:10.535
If not, I am in serious trouble.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.007
How many frigging molds
did you make?

19:16.042 --> 19:17.142
Like, 15?

19:17.176 --> 19:20.278
Three stone molds,
a little silicone mold,

19:20.312 --> 19:23.448
and then I attempted
to brush up the horns.

19:23.482 --> 19:25.550
- No good?
- I probably don't have horns.

19:25.584 --> 19:28.286
This is the most work
I've done in this competition.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.789
I'm worried about
how mine's gonna come together.

19:30.823 --> 19:31.923
- Same.
- Yeah.

19:31.957 --> 19:33.858
Everybody feels pretty
stressed right now.

19:33.893 --> 19:36.561
<i>This is a lot of work
that we all undertook,</i>

19:36.595 --> 19:38.730
so everybody feels crazy.

19:41.133 --> 19:45.537
Recently, my trick is
to summon demons into my makeup.

19:45.571 --> 19:47.272
So, that new demoness,

19:47.306 --> 19:50.108
she will be pissed off
if I mess it up.

19:50.142 --> 19:52.677
I should be more afraid of that
than of losing the challenge,

19:52.712 --> 19:54.612
because then she owns my soul.

19:56.816 --> 19:58.883
Damn it, Robert.

19:58.918 --> 19:59.884
What?

19:59.919 --> 20:01.953
[laughter]

20:01.987 --> 20:03.488
It's been a long day.

20:03.522 --> 20:04.656
<i>But I'm serious.</i>

20:10.663 --> 20:15.100
- Thank you, sir.
- All right. Let's do this.

20:15.134 --> 20:16.301
Oh, I actually have edges.

20:16.335 --> 20:19.037
- Walt.
- Oh, fuck!

20:19.071 --> 20:20.438
Oh, yay.

20:20.473 --> 20:22.774
<i>The first thing I do is check
on my foam pieces,</i>

20:22.808 --> 20:24.943
and they actually look okay.

20:24.977 --> 20:27.011
<i>This is way better
than I thought it was gonna be.</i>

20:31.650 --> 20:33.284
- How are you?
- All right.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.453
Hey.
How you doing?

20:35.488 --> 20:38.723
I hope to God
you can walk in these.

20:40.459 --> 20:42.961
<i>The porcupine quills
are pretty dangerous,</i>

20:42.995 --> 20:45.396
so before I put
on the face piece,

20:45.431 --> 20:48.466
I have to protect her skin
with a piece of plastic.

20:48.501 --> 20:50.034
<i>It's kind of like armor</i>

20:50.069 --> 20:51.603
in case she suddenly decides,

20:51.637 --> 20:53.938
"I want to run with my face
against the wall."

20:53.973 --> 20:55.073
It's a pretty big piece,

20:55.107 --> 20:57.008
so it might take a while
to get all that on.

20:57.042 --> 21:02.213
The way I sculpted my appliance,
it is going into her hairline,

21:02.248 --> 21:04.849
<i>and I can't really
give it down into her hair.</i>

21:04.884 --> 21:07.585
So, I stick it
under her wig cap,

21:07.620 --> 21:09.788
<i>and hopefully the wig
on top will hide it.</i>

21:13.692 --> 21:15.894
If this rips, it's okay.
It's gonna be covered in burn.

21:18.464 --> 21:20.064
I'm so happy that it lines up.

21:20.099 --> 21:23.601
I take my time applying face and
it all turns out really well.

21:23.636 --> 21:25.703
<i>So, now I can start painting.</i>

21:25.738 --> 21:27.906
<i>I start basing the entire face</i>

21:27.940 --> 21:32.110
and cowl out in a PAX tone...
which is like a pinky-white...

21:32.144 --> 21:34.879
<i>and then I take
the porcelain airbrush paint</i>

21:34.914 --> 21:36.447
<i>and just even it out.</i>

21:36.482 --> 21:40.318
After that, I start going from
light to dark with my airbrush.

21:40.352 --> 21:43.188
<i>I really need to make sure
my highlights and shadows</i>

21:43.222 --> 21:44.622
<i>make this sculpture pop.</i>

21:46.592 --> 21:48.193
- Do you feel pretty in there?
- Yeah.

21:48.227 --> 21:50.995
After I apply the cowl
and the brow piece,

21:51.030 --> 21:55.900
<i>I mix latex with coffee grounds
and I start applying the burns.</i>

21:55.935 --> 21:58.036
Once I paint it,
it looks like charred skin.

21:58.070 --> 21:59.337
So cool.

21:59.371 --> 22:02.507
I put it in the negative space
of the horns,

22:02.541 --> 22:04.709
<i>and I'm just trying
to lay it unevenly</i>

22:04.743 --> 22:06.711
and much like charred skin
would look,

22:06.745 --> 22:08.880
and then I used
black Aquacolor on it,

22:08.914 --> 22:09.914
and it's looking cool.

22:09.949 --> 22:11.015
You smell like coffee.

22:11.050 --> 22:13.218
The judges are gonna know
what I did here.

22:19.325 --> 22:20.758
<i>I get the face and cowl on.</i>

22:20.793 --> 22:22.360
So, I start putting in
the vines.

22:22.394 --> 22:25.330
<i>Basically, all I'm doing is
using give to put the vines in,</i>

22:25.364 --> 22:27.465
and it's kind of holding.

22:29.001 --> 22:31.135
<i>I'm trying to create this sort
of big head piece</i>

22:31.170 --> 22:35.006
so that it looks like
this flowing mess on one side,

22:35.040 --> 22:36.875
<i>and I think
it'll look really cool,</i>

22:36.909 --> 22:39.210
but not if the vines
fall off on the stage.

22:45.217 --> 22:47.118
<i>As I'm applying all the pieces,</i>

22:47.152 --> 22:48.620
<i>it's looking really cool,</i>

22:48.654 --> 22:50.889
and even though I didn't get
to finish the horns

22:50.923 --> 22:52.156
<i>that I tried to mold,</i>

22:52.191 --> 22:56.227
I actually find stock horns
that fit perfectly.

22:56.262 --> 22:57.862
<i>But there's not much time left,</i>

22:57.897 --> 23:00.031
and I need to finish
the paint job.

23:00.065 --> 23:01.232
It's acrylic paint and water.

23:01.267 --> 23:02.667
So, it's, like,
really thinned out.

23:02.701 --> 23:05.303
So, it sinks into
all the cracks and wrinkles.

23:05.337 --> 23:08.473
The acrylic wash, it's difficult
and it's time consuming.

23:08.507 --> 23:10.742
<i>So, I'm worried
about how much time I have left</i>

23:10.776 --> 23:12.277
<i>and if I can do it well.</i>

23:12.311 --> 23:13.645
That actually works.
Holy crap.

23:13.679 --> 23:14.679
Yay.

23:17.316 --> 23:18.650
These are taking way too long.

23:18.684 --> 23:20.718
<i>I'm trying to base out
all these emeralds</i>

23:20.753 --> 23:23.054
because I know I'm not gonna
have time in Last Looks

23:23.088 --> 23:24.589
<i>to highlight, shadow,</i>

23:24.623 --> 23:26.925
and put a shine
over all the emeralds.

23:26.959 --> 23:29.327
So, I'm worried that it's not
gonna have the look

23:29.361 --> 23:30.628
<i>that I really wanted it to,</i>

23:30.663 --> 23:32.897
but there's nothing I can do.

23:32.932 --> 23:34.732
15 minutes, everyone.

23:41.707 --> 23:43.641
That's time, everybody.

23:43.676 --> 23:44.676
Whoo.

23:44.710 --> 23:46.010
I got to give down your mouth.

23:46.045 --> 23:47.912
And then finish
your entire makeup.

23:47.947 --> 23:50.581
<i>I'm surprised that nobody's
looks totally painted</i>

23:50.616 --> 23:52.517
<i>and ready to go,
but I'm still nervous.</i>

23:52.551 --> 23:55.119
I'm still worried about
how much work I have left to do.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.729
Where's my vibrant green?

24:06.763 --> 24:08.831
We get to Last Looks,
and I got to start painting

24:08.866 --> 24:11.434
because I've got a lot
of detail work to do,

24:11.468 --> 24:13.970
<i>as well as all my lining
and cracking.</i>

24:14.004 --> 24:17.340
My hands are crazy
shaky right now.

24:20.244 --> 24:22.612
There's something
weird on this foam.

24:22.646 --> 24:24.780
<i>There is a piece of the foam</i>

24:24.815 --> 24:27.116
that I needed to patch
that I never did.

24:27.151 --> 24:31.220
We're just gonna
have to pretend it's not there.

24:31.255 --> 24:32.788
At this point,
it's way too late.

24:32.823 --> 24:33.890
I have to just let it go.

24:33.924 --> 24:35.324
There's no time to fix that.

24:35.359 --> 24:37.059
<i>I have to still do her eyes.</i>

24:37.094 --> 24:38.528
<i>I have to paint her arms.</i>

24:38.562 --> 24:39.695
So, I'm worried.

24:41.965 --> 24:44.233
<i>I don't have anything
that will work for the hands,</i>

24:44.268 --> 24:47.737
but then I realize that I
can use this extra face piece.

24:47.771 --> 24:49.338
<i>So, I tear up the face piece</i>

24:49.373 --> 24:51.774
and put bits
of the prosthetic on her hands.

24:51.808 --> 24:53.442
We're just gonna
bypass the fingernails.

24:53.477 --> 24:55.578
<i>It looks very woodsy,
and I'm excited.</i>

24:58.215 --> 25:01.217
The paint job on the face
piece is only halfway done.

25:01.251 --> 25:02.451
What in the hell?

25:02.486 --> 25:04.153
And my airbrush clogs.

25:04.188 --> 25:05.588
Gonna have to wing it.

25:05.622 --> 25:08.124
<i>So I grab some super color
and the foundation brush</i>

25:08.158 --> 25:11.227
<i>and I start painting as fast
as I possibly can.</i>

25:11.261 --> 25:12.528
15 minutes.

25:21.638 --> 25:24.106
All right, guys.
It's time.

25:24.141 --> 25:26.209
Oh, my God.

25:26.243 --> 25:27.577
That was pure madness.

25:27.611 --> 25:29.745
I look around in the room
and see the other makeups,

25:29.780 --> 25:33.349
<i>and I think my design
is still pretty interesting.</i>

25:33.383 --> 25:35.384
So, I hope the judges get it.

25:44.661 --> 25:47.730
Welcome to the Face Off
reveal stage.

25:47.764 --> 25:50.566
You know our fantastic series
judges.

25:50.601 --> 25:52.268
Owner of Alchemy Studio,
Glenn Hetrick.

25:52.302 --> 25:53.402
Good evening.

25:53.437 --> 25:54.704
- Hi, Glenn.
- How you doing?

25:54.738 --> 25:57.573
Oscar and Emmy award-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

25:57.608 --> 25:58.608
Hello, everyone.

25:58.642 --> 25:59.775
All: Hi.

25:59.810 --> 26:01.944
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

26:01.979 --> 26:04.013
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Neville.

26:04.047 --> 26:05.748
All right, let's get to it.

26:05.782 --> 26:09.518
This week, we presented you
with various evil sorceresses

26:09.553 --> 26:12.555
who use magic to maintain
their beautiful appearances.

26:12.589 --> 26:14.790
Your Spotlight Challenge
was to choose one

26:14.825 --> 26:16.459
and show us what her monstrous

26:16.493 --> 26:20.896
or hideous true self looks
like after the magic wears off.

26:20.931 --> 26:22.365
Let's take a look
at your creations.

26:24.568 --> 26:27.536
<i>[spooky music]</i>

26:27.571 --> 26:35.578
♪ ♪

26:45.722 --> 26:48.157
<i>I really think I hit the mark
on this challenge.</i>

26:48.191 --> 26:51.294
The hard work and stress
is finally paying off.

27:10.414 --> 27:12.315
<i>I like my sculpture
and the paint job.</i>

27:12.349 --> 27:15.851
So, I'm feeling good
about this overall character.

27:37.174 --> 27:39.008
<i>It's better than I thought
it was going to be,</i>

27:39.042 --> 27:41.477
but at this point,
I just want to be safe.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.401
<i>This vine thing
looks pretty cool.</i>

28:05.435 --> 28:06.569
With the exception
of the wardrobe,

28:06.603 --> 28:08.738
I'm very pleased
with how it looks.

28:30.727 --> 28:34.530
<i>Seeing my sorceress look
at herself as what I've created</i>

28:34.564 --> 28:37.099
is really cool,
and I think she looks awesome.

28:58.488 --> 29:00.790
<i>I am aware
of my technical flaws.</i>

29:00.824 --> 29:02.892
<i>But I still
really like my design.</i>

29:02.926 --> 29:04.727
She is pretty evil.

29:24.514 --> 29:25.948
<i>I know that it's incomplete,</i>

29:25.982 --> 29:28.050
<i>but the overall look
of her I'm really pleased with,</i>

29:28.084 --> 29:30.753
and I really like
how powerful and evil she looks.

29:34.791 --> 29:37.092
Judges, why don't you go ahead
and take a closer look?

29:43.867 --> 29:44.967
The breakup's nice.

29:45.001 --> 29:46.735
I love the color choice.

29:46.770 --> 29:48.404
Wow, he even got her hands done.

29:48.438 --> 29:51.373
With some really specific
scaling.

29:51.408 --> 29:52.842
Let's see the back.

29:52.876 --> 29:55.711
There's a beautiful echoing
of the human anatomy

29:55.745 --> 30:00.349
with these scapula peaks and
this beautiful vertical piece.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.154
This is even better up close.

30:05.188 --> 30:06.689
And the sculpting
is a really subtle.

30:06.723 --> 30:09.692
Just these tiny
little wrinkly lines here.

30:09.726 --> 30:11.861
You can't figure out
if it's bone or flesh.

30:11.895 --> 30:13.429
And this really nice
countershading

30:13.463 --> 30:15.064
separating everything out.

30:15.098 --> 30:16.432
It's really creepy.

30:16.466 --> 30:19.235
So much of the sculpting is
happening in the airbrush work.

30:21.471 --> 30:24.773
Wow, this is far worse
up close than I had feared.

30:24.808 --> 30:26.342
The proportions
are all off for me.

30:26.376 --> 30:28.844
If she would have made the top
of the head much bigger, that

30:28.879 --> 30:29.912
would have really helped a lot.

30:29.946 --> 30:31.514
It would've.

30:31.548 --> 30:33.516
<i>It's obvious the judges
aren't into this makeup.</i>

30:33.550 --> 30:34.750
Open your mouth.

30:34.784 --> 30:36.819
You don't need the teeth.

30:36.853 --> 30:38.921
At this point, I need a miracle

30:38.955 --> 30:40.523
to keep me in this competition.

30:43.660 --> 30:45.528
All right, guys, it's time
to get on Twitter

30:45.562 --> 30:47.863
and tell us who made your
favorite evil sorceress

30:47.898 --> 30:49.532
using #FaceOff

30:52.687 --> 30:55.789
Wow, this is actually far
worse up close

30:55.823 --> 30:56.990
than I had feared.

30:57.025 --> 30:59.459
Yeah. The proportions
are all off for me.

30:59.494 --> 31:03.063
They're looking at everything
that is wrong with it.

31:03.097 --> 31:04.665
I'm just hoping
to be safe this week.

31:08.536 --> 31:10.637
First off,
I don't like this at all.

31:10.672 --> 31:13.573
Second off, there's some really
cool stuff happening with it.

31:13.608 --> 31:15.575
The color choices
are bizarre, too.

31:15.610 --> 31:17.044
It's almost like an avant garde

31:17.078 --> 31:18.345
approach to the challenge.

31:20.782 --> 31:23.116
Her beauty makeup part
of this is really well done.

31:23.151 --> 31:24.551
She's really quite exquisite.

31:24.585 --> 31:27.087
Okay, turn to the side, honey.

31:27.121 --> 31:28.989
All the way around.

31:29.023 --> 31:32.259
Even as an attempt
to sculpt the illusion of flame.

31:32.293 --> 31:33.794
This is nothing like it.

31:33.828 --> 31:36.530
It looks like she got her head
shoved in baked Alaska.

31:40.201 --> 31:41.668
Wow, this is kooky-looking.

31:41.703 --> 31:44.705
It looks like she's not all the
way transformed or something.

31:44.739 --> 31:46.540
I don't think
that was a good choice.

31:46.574 --> 31:49.810
Seeing this as a full
symmetrical character

31:49.844 --> 31:51.745
would've been
so much more interesting.

31:53.247 --> 31:55.415
It's way too many
different tones

31:55.450 --> 31:56.783
that are fighting one another.

31:56.818 --> 31:58.685
I really love what's happening
with the mouth here.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.922
Not the colors,
but that texture is gorgeous.

32:07.829 --> 32:09.963
All right. The judges
have scored your creations.

32:09.998 --> 32:11.665
Let's find out
what they thought.

32:11.699 --> 32:14.234
Mel.

32:14.268 --> 32:16.803
<i>Melissa.</i>

32:16.838 --> 32:17.871
<i>Walter.</i>

32:20.041 --> 32:21.742
Congratulations,
you are all safe

32:21.776 --> 32:23.543
and can head back
to the makeup room.

32:23.578 --> 32:24.578
Thank you.

32:31.452 --> 32:32.519
That means the rest of you

32:32.553 --> 32:34.454
were the best
and the worst this week,

32:34.489 --> 32:36.490
and the judges would like
to hear from each of you

32:36.524 --> 32:38.125
before making their decisions.

32:38.159 --> 32:40.694
Yvonne, please step forward.

32:46.334 --> 32:48.001
- Hi, Yvonne.
- Hi.

32:48.036 --> 32:51.004
Tell us about your approach
to this corpse conjurer.

32:51.039 --> 32:52.939
She enchants the dead,

32:52.974 --> 32:57.878
and when she does she starts to
transform into a corpse herself.

32:57.912 --> 33:00.280
I wanted the skull
to press through her skin.

33:00.314 --> 33:01.815
I didn't want
her to be like a corpse

33:01.849 --> 33:03.316
when she conjures the dead.

33:03.351 --> 33:04.718
I absolutely love this.

33:06.721 --> 33:08.422
It is so smooth.

33:08.456 --> 33:11.892
That soft, subtle touch
with the airbrush

33:11.926 --> 33:15.495
is exactly what gives it
such a fantasy look.

33:15.530 --> 33:16.930
It's just gorgeous.

33:16.964 --> 33:18.932
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Oh, my God.

33:18.966 --> 33:22.636
It's like her skin
has fused with her skull.

33:22.670 --> 33:25.205
I love your paint job.
I love the colors you chose.

33:25.239 --> 33:26.873
It's really nicely done, honey.

33:26.908 --> 33:28.175
Thank you.

33:28.209 --> 33:30.010
It's a skull
for all intents and purposes,

33:30.044 --> 33:32.245
but retains her beauty,

33:32.280 --> 33:34.648
and I think that that's
a difficult thing to pull off,

33:34.682 --> 33:36.483
and you've managed
it quite well.

33:36.517 --> 33:38.385
Thank you so much.

33:38.419 --> 33:39.753
Yvonne, please step back.

33:39.787 --> 33:41.822
Thank you.
Thanks.

33:47.662 --> 33:48.662
Robert.

33:56.471 --> 33:57.504
Hello, Robert.

33:57.538 --> 33:58.638
Hello.

33:58.673 --> 34:00.841
Please tell us
about this evil sea witch.

34:00.875 --> 34:03.643
This is Maris Tenebris,

34:03.678 --> 34:06.513
which translates to
"darkness of the sea."

34:06.547 --> 34:08.915
She lures the men
with her beauty,

34:08.949 --> 34:13.954
and when she reveals her true
face, it's already too late.

34:13.987 --> 34:16.690
I'm bummed out that you didn't
complete the whole makeup.

34:18.559 --> 34:20.127
Instead of doing
it mid-transition,

34:20.161 --> 34:21.393
if we would have
seen the whole thing,

34:21.429 --> 34:23.196
it would have been
a lot cooler-looking.

34:23.231 --> 34:25.065
I wanted her sort
of be kind of pretty,

34:25.099 --> 34:26.600
so I kept, like, one half.

34:26.634 --> 34:29.002
I'm not quite sure there's
enough of that pretty side

34:29.036 --> 34:30.871
left under there, unfortunately.

34:30.905 --> 34:32.572
What is the detail

34:32.607 --> 34:34.841
that's sticking out
on her right-hand side?

34:34.876 --> 34:36.109
- Oh, this here?
- Yeah, yeah.

34:36.143 --> 34:39.980
It's like a little wing
for fishes.

34:40.014 --> 34:41.248
A wing for fishes?

34:41.282 --> 34:42.748
Oh, yeah.
You know, a fish-wing.

34:42.783 --> 34:44.284
- No, that's a fin.
- Tiny ones.

34:44.318 --> 34:45.784
Okay.
I get it.

34:45.820 --> 34:47.721
I don't like it, but I get it.

34:47.755 --> 34:50.090
If it was a gill-like feature,

34:50.123 --> 34:53.025
I think it would have elevated
the sophistication of it.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.393
There's some great stuff
happening,

34:54.428 --> 34:57.964
it just doesn't hold up
as a whole for me.

34:57.999 --> 35:00.333
I really like the forms
that you have going on here,

35:00.368 --> 35:02.169
and I think if you would have
just concentrated on bringing

35:02.203 --> 35:04.704
that across the face
in a nice, tight paintjob,

35:04.739 --> 35:07.674
you could have ended up
with a very successful makeup.

35:07.708 --> 35:09.075
Okay.

35:09.110 --> 35:10.977
Robert, you can head back.

35:17.985 --> 35:19.686
Anna, please come forward.

35:26.861 --> 35:27.961
- Hi, Anna.
- Hello.

35:27.995 --> 35:30.430
Tell us about your shadow
enchantress.

35:30.464 --> 35:34.201
She is a demon
that wants what she can't have,

35:34.235 --> 35:37.971
so she seduces people
and takes their souls.

35:38.005 --> 35:41.141
I wanted these to be horns
on top of her head,

35:41.175 --> 35:42.542
like she was, you know, a demon.

35:42.577 --> 35:44.978
But I didn't just want,
like, two horns coming out.

35:45.012 --> 35:48.348
I wanted her to look more
sunken in and hollow,

35:48.382 --> 35:50.517
but it got away from me.

35:50.551 --> 35:53.453
It's just a bit
too cliché and on the nose.

35:55.423 --> 35:58.458
Some of the forms are so
either asymmetrically sculpted

35:58.492 --> 36:00.026
or asymmetrically applied.

36:00.061 --> 36:01.361
It's those elements

36:01.395 --> 36:05.732
that affect the integrity
of this particular design.

36:05.766 --> 36:07.100
I'll give you an E for effort,

36:07.134 --> 36:10.036
but you didn't quite
get there in terms of the build.

36:10.071 --> 36:12.739
The stalagmite-type formations

36:12.773 --> 36:15.642
just issuing forth from the top
of her head

36:15.676 --> 36:19.346
to me echoes more your confusion
in terms of what your design

36:19.380 --> 36:24.017
was going to be than it
does the point of the challenge.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.186
From a distance,
she looks fantastic.

36:26.220 --> 36:28.788
It's when you get up close where
everything starts falling apart.

36:28.823 --> 36:31.124
You're putting something
on top of somebody's head

36:31.158 --> 36:32.559
that's covering their ears.

36:32.593 --> 36:34.694
That's gonna make this part
of their face really wide,

36:34.729 --> 36:37.063
and whatever is on top
is gonna get very narrow,

36:37.098 --> 36:40.066
so the proportions
get all kind of wonky.

36:40.101 --> 36:41.167
Thank you.

36:41.202 --> 36:43.403
Anna, if you please, step down.

36:43.437 --> 36:44.437
Thank you.

36:49.844 --> 36:51.311
Rob, please step forward.

36:58.719 --> 37:00.220
Tell me about your dragon queen.

37:00.254 --> 37:03.590
She is this ancient
dragon empress

37:03.624 --> 37:06.593
who lures young girls
into her service and then

37:06.627 --> 37:09.195
slowly drains their youth
and absorbs their energy.

37:09.230 --> 37:10.764
My goal for this was to create
something

37:10.798 --> 37:12.599
that was obviously dragon,

37:12.633 --> 37:15.135
but I didn't want
to build a dragon.

37:15.169 --> 37:17.304
I think it turned out
pretty good.

37:17.338 --> 37:20.473
I think you're right
about that, Rob.

37:20.508 --> 37:23.109
You covered so much
and gave us details,

37:23.144 --> 37:26.713
but you didn't go nuts and
bite off more than you can chew.

37:26.747 --> 37:28.848
It's a hard thing to do
with the time that you're given.

37:28.883 --> 37:30.483
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

37:30.518 --> 37:34.354
Would you please have
your model turn around for us?

37:34.388 --> 37:36.890
Amazing, dude.
That's phenomenal.

37:36.924 --> 37:38.058
I would have liked to have seen

37:38.092 --> 37:40.093
her face look
a little bit more feminine.

37:40.127 --> 37:41.995
- But it's beautiful makeup.
- Thank you.

37:42.029 --> 37:44.698
You managed to integrate
the form language

37:44.732 --> 37:47.267
of that head horn
with that beautiful bone line

37:47.301 --> 37:51.104
as well as allowing for
a classic demon furrowed brow.

37:51.138 --> 37:53.473
The overall vision
is really spectacular.

37:53.507 --> 37:54.941
Thank you.

37:54.975 --> 37:56.543
Rob, please step back.

37:56.577 --> 37:57.577
Thank you.

38:02.817 --> 38:04.551
All right, guys, please head
back to the makeup room

38:04.585 --> 38:06.286
while the judges deliberate.

38:13.661 --> 38:16.563
Okay, you guys still have
your special immunity available

38:16.597 --> 38:18.264
if you'd like to use it tonight.

38:18.299 --> 38:20.333
So, with that, why don't we talk
about your favorite looks?

38:20.368 --> 38:22.602
Why don't we start with Yvonne?

38:22.636 --> 38:26.239
<i>Such a beautiful,
clean sculpture and paint job.</i>

38:26.273 --> 38:28.975
I'm just so impressed
with the symmetry of this.

38:29.009 --> 38:30.877
I just love the way
that the skin

38:30.911 --> 38:32.479
<i>looked like it was
fused to the bone.</i>

38:32.513 --> 38:35.315
<i>Really beautiful, subtle
sculpting all over that makeup.</i>

38:35.349 --> 38:36.483
<i>Really nicely done.</i>

38:36.517 --> 38:38.585
She's getting
better every single week.

38:38.619 --> 38:40.887
All right, let's move on to Rob.

38:40.921 --> 38:42.422
<i>Absolutely brilliant.</i>

38:42.456 --> 38:44.891
<i>The back's just as good
if not better than the front.</i>

38:44.925 --> 38:46.259
It's all gorgeous.

38:46.293 --> 38:48.228
Even the accuracy of the hands,

38:48.262 --> 38:51.030
<i>which was done quickly, but it
didn't look like it at all.</i>

38:51.065 --> 38:52.766
<i>In fact, none of it looked like
it was done quickly.</i>

38:52.800 --> 38:54.267
<i>Everything was cohesive.</i>

38:54.301 --> 38:55.702
It was so beautifully done.

38:55.736 --> 38:57.203
All right,
so let's move on to the looks

38:57.238 --> 38:59.105
that didn't work
for you so well this week.

38:59.140 --> 39:00.807
Let's start with Robert.

39:00.841 --> 39:02.942
<i>I fear that he's being a bit
too playful.</i>

39:02.977 --> 39:04.778
<i>He's like the class clown
of Face Off.</i>

39:04.812 --> 39:06.346
<i>And this isn't the challenge
for it.</i>

39:06.380 --> 39:08.348
<i>I don't believe it should
have been a transition makeup.</i>

39:08.382 --> 39:10.150
<i>It should have been
a complete character,</i>

39:10.184 --> 39:11.951
which is what we didn't get.

39:11.986 --> 39:13.286
I think if he applied himself,

39:13.320 --> 39:15.422
he could really pull out
a great makeup.

39:15.456 --> 39:17.190
This certainly wasn't one.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.025
All right,
let's move on to Anna.

39:19.059 --> 39:20.326
<i>Well, I love the idea.</i>

39:20.361 --> 39:21.961
<i>It was very Maleficent-like.</i>

39:21.996 --> 39:24.264
<i>A distance read was pretty
good, but, you know,</i>

39:24.298 --> 39:26.900
when you get up close, you see
how wonky the whole thing was.

39:26.934 --> 39:29.102
It looks like it was glued
on asymmetrically.

39:29.136 --> 39:31.137
<i>The nose is moving just a touch
to the right,</i>

39:31.172 --> 39:32.605
<i>and the chin a bit to the left.</i>

39:32.640 --> 39:36.042
The only thing she got right
is the idea of the white

39:36.076 --> 39:37.744
<i>and the black... the palette
with the wardrobe.</i>

39:37.778 --> 39:40.346
Other than that, everything
on this makeup has failed.

39:40.381 --> 39:41.681
- Yeah.
- All right, then.

39:41.715 --> 39:43.950
Judges, have you made up
your minds?

39:43.984 --> 39:45.218
- Yes, we have.
- Okay.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.286
Let's bring them back out.

39:55.429 --> 39:57.464
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top looks.

39:57.498 --> 39:58.765
Yvonne,

39:58.799 --> 40:01.334
<i>you gave us a gorgeous,
fantastical character,</i>

40:01.368 --> 40:03.336
<i>and you struck
a really interesting balance</i>

40:03.370 --> 40:05.605
<i>between the horrific
and the beautiful.</i>

40:05.639 --> 40:07.106
And Rob,

40:07.141 --> 40:10.410
<i>we love the detailed sculpting
in the face and the back,</i>

40:10.444 --> 40:11.878
<i>and we were impressed</i>

40:11.912 --> 40:14.948
<i>with how well you put
the whole character together.</i>

40:14.982 --> 40:16.916
So, who is the winner
of this challenge?

40:16.951 --> 40:18.952
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

40:26.672 --> 40:28.039
So, who is the winner
of this challenge?

40:28.073 --> 40:30.541
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

40:34.713 --> 40:35.847
Rob.

40:38.383 --> 40:41.052
<i>You really,
really wowed us this week.</i>

40:41.086 --> 40:44.288
<i>You did so much,
and you did it so well.</i>

40:44.323 --> 40:47.125
It's almost unbelievable
that you did it by yourself.

40:47.159 --> 40:48.126
Thank you.

40:48.160 --> 40:50.261
Ah! I'm so excited.

40:50.295 --> 40:52.497
<i>This is my favorite makeup
so far,</i>

40:52.531 --> 40:55.800
and I'm so happy that I've done
this well and gotten this far.

40:55.834 --> 40:58.002
- Rob, congratulations.
- Thank you.

40:58.036 --> 41:00.204
You and Yvonne can head back
to the makeup room.

41:00.239 --> 41:01.405
Thank you.

41:05.377 --> 41:06.711
All right, guys.

41:06.745 --> 41:09.313
That means the two of you
are on the bottom this week,

41:09.348 --> 41:12.216
and one of you will be going
home.

41:12.251 --> 41:13.284
Please step forward.

41:21.827 --> 41:23.828
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

41:23.862 --> 41:26.931
Robert, despite a few
cool shapes in your sculpture,

41:26.965 --> 41:28.299
<i>your makeup felt half-baked</i>

41:28.333 --> 41:30.968
<i>and bit of an odd fit
for this challenge.</i>

41:31.003 --> 41:32.703
And Anna, from afar,

41:32.738 --> 41:35.439
<i>your character definitely
captured that classic look,</i>

41:35.474 --> 41:38.810
<i>but it was littered
with technical problems.</i>

41:38.844 --> 41:40.912
So who is going home tonight?

41:40.946 --> 41:42.446
The person
going home tonight is...

41:45.818 --> 41:47.051
Anna.

41:48.720 --> 41:51.055
Clearly, a lot
went wrong for you this week.

41:51.089 --> 41:52.490
The concept was lacking,

41:52.524 --> 41:57.195
and your technical execution was
pretty poor across the board.

41:57.229 --> 42:00.164
Anna, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

42:00.199 --> 42:01.866
That means,
Robert, you're safe this week

42:01.900 --> 42:03.801
and can head back
to the makeup room.

42:03.836 --> 42:04.869
Bye, Robert.

42:09.141 --> 42:11.609
Anna,
although you're leaving us,

42:11.643 --> 42:13.878
just know that you're also
leaving us

42:13.912 --> 42:16.647
with some great exposure
to your talents.

42:16.682 --> 42:18.616
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

42:18.650 --> 42:21.686
I've been wanting to be
on Face Off since season one,

42:21.720 --> 42:23.521
so this is a dream come true,

42:23.555 --> 42:25.189
and I had a great, great time.

42:25.224 --> 42:26.824
And we're glad you were here.

42:26.859 --> 42:29.327
Anna, it's been so great
having you here with us,

42:29.361 --> 42:31.262
and if you'll please,
head back to the makeup room

42:31.296 --> 42:32.864
and pack up your kit.

42:32.898 --> 42:34.699
- Thank you so much.
- Good luck, Anna.

42:34.733 --> 42:36.466
- Thank you, Anna.
- Bye-bye.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.616
This challenge totally
got away from me.

42:40.862 --> 42:42.980
- It's me.
- What?

42:42.981 --> 42:46.196
But, I'm leaving here with
my head held high.

42:47.778 --> 42:50.306
I love special-effects makeup.

42:50.307 --> 42:52.019
So I'm definitely gonna
keep going for it,

42:52.020 --> 42:53.110
I'm not giving up.

42:53.527 --> 42:55.644
This has not set me back at all.
