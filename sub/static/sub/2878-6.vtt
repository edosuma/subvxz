WEBVTT

00:01.677 --> 00:04.145
So what kind of cruise
is this you're going on?

00:04.147 --> 00:07.015
It's called
the Born Again Boat Ride.

00:07.017 --> 00:10.401
Christian Quarterly gave
it their highest rating--

00:10.403 --> 00:12.821
five thorny crowns.

00:12.823 --> 00:15.156
I do wish you'd
come with me, Sheldon.

00:15.158 --> 00:19.027
Well, Mom, if I did, it
would be conclusive proof

00:19.029 --> 00:21.246
that your God
can work miracles.

00:22.331 --> 00:23.348
You're missing out.

00:23.350 --> 00:24.782
It's gonna
be wall-to-wall fun.

00:24.784 --> 00:25.834
It's all themed.

00:25.836 --> 00:27.818
There's Jonah
and the Whale Watching.

00:29.388 --> 00:32.340
All-you-can-eat
Last Supper Buffet.

00:32.342 --> 00:34.709
And my personal favorite,
Gunning with God.

00:34.711 --> 00:38.263
What's Gunning with God?
I'm afraid to ask.

00:38.265 --> 00:40.965
Oh, it is a hoot
and a half.

00:40.967 --> 00:43.668
You write your sins
on a clay pigeon,

00:43.670 --> 00:45.803
they fire 'em up in the air,
and you pulverize them

00:45.805 --> 00:47.555
with a 12-gauge shotgun

00:47.557 --> 00:51.609
full of our Lord's
forgiveness.

00:51.611 --> 00:54.362
Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged
to see how advanced

00:54.364 --> 00:56.364
your group has become--
willing to sail out

00:56.366 --> 00:59.951
into the ocean without fear
of falling off the edge.

00:59.953 --> 01:01.736
For example,

01:01.738 --> 01:03.621
if Shelly was aboard,
he'd write,

01:03.623 --> 01:05.790
"Smart mouth"
on his pigeon,

01:05.792 --> 01:09.627
and then bam!

01:09.629 --> 01:12.130
The Lord giveth and
the Lord bloweth away.

01:12.132 --> 01:13.414
Well, Mom,

01:13.416 --> 01:16.301
according to my itinerary
for our weekend together,

01:16.303 --> 01:18.117
the fun begins with
fried chicken.

01:18.142 --> 01:19.342
Sounds delicious.

01:19.472 --> 01:21.639
Good, 'cause I got you everything
you need to make it.

01:21.641 --> 01:24.158
You are in for a treat.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.510
My mother's fried chicken

01:25.512 --> 01:29.347
is why we had to buy my dad
the extra large coffin.

01:29.349 --> 01:31.382
Sheldon, she just
got off the plane.

01:31.384 --> 01:32.817
She doesn't want to cook.

01:32.819 --> 01:34.269
Of course she does.

01:34.271 --> 01:36.988
Making me food is her way
of saying "I love you""

01:36.990 --> 01:39.190
Making me food when
she's too tired to cook

01:39.192 --> 01:41.326
is her way of saying
"I really love you."

01:41.328 --> 01:43.912
Actually, I wouldn't mind going
out for a bite, Sheldon.

01:43.914 --> 01:45.363
Won't that spoil our appetites

01:45.365 --> 01:47.231
for the chicken you're
going to make me?

01:47.233 --> 01:49.200
All right, that settles it, we're
going out. Do you like sushi?

01:49.202 --> 01:51.836
There's a great little
place down the street.

01:51.838 --> 01:53.479
I've never had it,
but there's no harm in

01:53.504 --> 01:54.722
trying something new.

01:55.575 --> 01:58.075
There's a lot of harm
in trying something new.

01:58.077 --> 01:59.838
That's why we test out
drugs and cosmetics

01:59.863 --> 02:01.063
on bunny rabbits.

02:01.381 --> 02:04.632
Sheldon, you're talking
like a crazy person.

02:04.634 --> 02:08.019
Actually, I had him
tested as a child.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.770
Doctor says he's fine.

02:09.773 --> 02:11.356
Told you.

02:11.358 --> 02:13.358
Although, I do regret
not following up

02:13.360 --> 02:14.976
with that specialist in Houston.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.835
Irasshaimase!

02:46.905 --> 02:49.356
Stop yelling!

02:49.720 --> 02:51.836
I'm not happy about this.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.855
What's the last thing
you were ever happy about?

02:53.857 --> 02:56.608
The prospect
of fried chicken.

02:58.477 --> 03:00.011
This is exciting.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.397
Back home, the diner on
Route Four serves sushi,

03:02.399 --> 03:05.900
but it's just cut up fish sticks
and a side of Uncle Ben's.

03:05.902 --> 03:07.518
They put it on the menu

03:07.520 --> 03:12.073
in those kung fu letters,
but that don't make it sushi.

03:12.075 --> 03:16.711
Uh, kung fu letters might
not be politically correct.

03:16.713 --> 03:20.331
Oh, I thought the one we
couldn't say was "ching chong""

03:20.333 --> 03:23.752
Yeah, yeah, that, too.

03:23.754 --> 03:25.553
So, Shelly, what's up

03:25.555 --> 03:27.422
with you and your friend Amy,

03:27.424 --> 03:29.641
if you don't mind
a mother prying a bit?

03:29.643 --> 03:33.178
Well, there's actually
big news on the Amy front.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.634
She's been studying the

03:34.659 --> 03:37.305
neurobiology of addiction
in lower animals.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.769
She's this close to getting
a starfish hooked on cocaine.

03:40.771 --> 03:44.322
Do you have any idea what's
going on with those two?

03:44.324 --> 03:46.574
It's kind of like
the Loch Ness monster.

03:46.576 --> 03:47.997
Maybe there's something
there, maybe there isn't.

03:48.022 --> 03:49.222
We'll probably never know.

03:50.830 --> 03:55.166
But sometimes it's fun to creep
yourself out thinking about it.

03:57.620 --> 04:01.089
How are you doing on
the young lady front?

04:01.091 --> 04:03.958
I hear you're in some sort
of a long distance situation?

04:03.960 --> 04:06.244
Yeah, it's Raj's sister.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.545
It's kind of tough.

04:07.547 --> 04:09.080
She's in India.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.932
Also, her parents aren't happy
she's dating someone white.

04:10.934 --> 04:12.917
Oh, that's funny
turn, isn't it?

04:12.919 --> 04:17.387
You never think about it
going the other way.

04:19.475 --> 04:22.610
Well, you can't force things.

04:22.612 --> 04:24.762
You need to figure out if
you're in a relationship

04:24.764 --> 04:26.397
or if you're just
calling it one.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.233
It's like they say--
a cat can have kittens

04:28.235 --> 04:31.820
in the oven but that
don't make 'em biscuits.

04:31.822 --> 04:33.938
And that reminds me
of another saying.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.067
You can lead a chicken
to Crisco, but you can't

04:36.092 --> 04:37.371
make your mother fry it.

04:39.444 --> 04:42.914
Sheldon, you pester me one
more time about chicken,

04:42.916 --> 04:46.217
I will put you over my knee
right here in this restaurant.

04:47.470 --> 04:50.088
Please pester her.
Please, for me.

04:53.642 --> 04:55.977
So, Mrs. Cooper, what did
you think of the sushi?

04:55.979 --> 04:57.228
It was good.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.647
The only thing that would
have made it better

04:59.649 --> 05:01.683
is if it was cooked

05:01.685 --> 05:05.019
and if it was beef.

05:05.021 --> 05:08.156
Sheldon, when is your landlord
going to fix the elevator?

05:08.158 --> 05:09.941
I don't know.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.659
Lately we've been talking about

05:11.661 --> 05:15.113
converting it
into a missile silo.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.248
Your son seems to think

05:17.250 --> 05:20.752
we need to launch
a preemptive strike on Burbank.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.705
Get them before
they get us.

05:29.845 --> 05:33.381
Hey, look who decided
to show up.

05:33.383 --> 05:35.383
Raj, what are you doing?

05:35.385 --> 05:39.721
I couldn't find you guys
so I bought six new friends.

05:40.656 --> 05:44.209
Three, sadly, are dead.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.444
Mom, you
remember Rajesh?

05:46.446 --> 05:48.563
- Rajesh, my mother.
- Of course.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.782
Mrs. Cooper.
So nice to see you again.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.318
Well, it's so nice
to see you, too.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.521
I thought it was
our Indians

05:57.523 --> 06:00.858
that had the occasional
alcohol problem.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.879
We don't say that, either.

06:06.198 --> 06:08.917
I'll make you a list.

06:08.919 --> 06:10.969
Oh, that would be mighty
white of you.

06:12.871 --> 06:16.674
So, Raj, what pain
are you trying

06:16.676 --> 06:18.927
to cover up with alcohol?

06:18.929 --> 06:20.678
- Nothing, I'm fine.
- Are ya?

06:20.680 --> 06:22.814
No.

06:22.816 --> 06:23.932
That's better.

06:23.934 --> 06:25.366
Now tell me what's
bothering you.

06:25.368 --> 06:27.685
I'm so lonely.

06:27.687 --> 06:30.238
Oh, yes, born alone,
die alone.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.523
It's a tragic
human condition.

06:32.525 --> 06:33.575
Now, Raj,

06:33.577 --> 06:34.892
if you'll excuse my mother,

06:34.894 --> 06:36.694
she's about to make a pecan pie

06:36.696 --> 06:38.580
that'll be so good
I'll almost forget

06:38.582 --> 06:40.748
how she blew it
with the fried chicken.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.784
Sheldon, your
friend is hurtin'.

06:42.786 --> 06:44.752
What do we do when
someone's hurtin'?

06:44.754 --> 06:47.905
Offer them a hot beverage.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.407
And when they're
drunk as a skunk,

06:49.409 --> 06:50.842
what beverage
do we offer?

06:50.844 --> 06:52.927
Coffee.

06:52.929 --> 06:55.263
And what do we do it with?

07:01.537 --> 07:04.755
Now you listen to me.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.775
I know you feel like
you can't find someone,

07:07.777 --> 07:09.477
but there's a
lock for every key.

07:09.479 --> 07:10.862
Back home, there's a girl

07:10.864 --> 07:14.282
works at the Wal-Mart.
Tall, tall girl.

07:14.284 --> 07:17.035
Woman could hunt
geese with a rake.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.569
Thought she'd never

07:18.571 --> 07:21.789
find a man, then one day,
wouldn't ya know,

07:21.791 --> 07:24.459
Harlem Globetrotters
come to town.

07:24.461 --> 07:27.445
Long story short,

07:27.447 --> 07:29.631
today that woman
travels the world

07:29.633 --> 07:31.499
with a semi-professional
basketball player

07:31.501 --> 07:34.752
and two beautiful
mixed-race babies.

07:34.754 --> 07:39.057
I didn't get a lot of that
because of your accent,

07:39.059 --> 07:40.892
but the general tone
was soothing

07:40.894 --> 07:42.793
and somehow I feel better.

07:44.263 --> 07:48.232
I'm not going to get
my pecan pie, am I?

07:48.234 --> 07:49.967
You want some Oreos?

07:49.969 --> 07:51.602
- Double Stuf?
- No, regular.

07:51.604 --> 07:54.355
Nice. Kick a man when he's down.

07:55.491 --> 07:58.443
I'm glad we're finally getting
to do something together,

07:58.445 --> 08:00.078
just the two of us.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.341
Sure. One thing you really
miss when you're on

08:01.366 --> 08:03.085
vacation is laundry.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.284
Careful, you're using
too much Downey.

08:06.286 --> 08:09.037
You know if my clothes get
too soft it makes me sleepy.

08:09.039 --> 08:11.155
Well, this takes me back.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.258
Me doing your laundry, you
next to me criticizing.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.210
It is nice, isn't it?

08:16.212 --> 08:18.880
Mrs. Cooper.

08:18.882 --> 08:22.500
- Hi!
- Oh, hello, darlin'.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.352
Sheldon, you didn't tell
me your mom was coming.

08:24.354 --> 08:26.888
It was in my weekly
e-mail blast.

08:26.890 --> 08:27.789
Right between

08:27.791 --> 08:29.857
"Beet season is finally here"

08:29.859 --> 08:34.062
and "Uh-oh, red stool from
beets leads to cancer scare."

08:37.032 --> 08:39.033
So, how've you been?

08:39.034 --> 08:40.150
Good, good.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.736
I hear that Leonard
has a new girlfriend.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.203
How are you doing
with all that?

08:43.206 --> 08:45.206
Oh, fine. You know,
it's been a while.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.824
I'm getting
back out there.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.327
Let me ask you, when
you get back out there,

08:49.329 --> 08:51.913
are you wearing this?

08:52.831 --> 08:55.533
Well, it's super cute on.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.472
That top has paid for itself
in free drinks like ten

08:57.497 --> 08:58.971
times what it cost.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.540
Yes, Penny has a lot
of her money tied up

09:02.542 --> 09:03.707
in promiscuity futures.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.010
Hon, you think

09:06.012 --> 09:08.763
maybe the reason why
you're having trouble

09:08.765 --> 09:10.598
finding a guy
to settle down with

09:10.600 --> 09:12.934
is because you're letting them
ride the roller coaster

09:12.936 --> 09:15.052
without buying a ticket?

09:15.054 --> 09:18.906
Oh, they don't always get
to ride the roller coaster.

09:18.908 --> 09:22.944
Sometimes they only get
to spin the teacups.

09:25.714 --> 09:27.498
Now I'm going out tonight.
Would it be crazy

09:27.500 --> 09:29.834
to ask you to look at the
outfit I'm going to wear?

09:29.836 --> 09:31.735
Oh, not crazy at all.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.037
And don't beat yourself up.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.790
When I was your age, you could
have me for a car ride

09:35.792 --> 09:37.575
and a bottle
of strawberry wine.

09:42.064 --> 09:45.883
That will not be
in this week's e-mail blast.

09:47.002 --> 09:48.719
So, this spring,
I get to go

09:48.721 --> 09:51.589
to the International
Space Station.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.643
Oh, my word,
a trip to the heavens.

09:56.779 --> 09:58.980
If you ever want
to live there eternally,

09:58.982 --> 10:01.282
I've got a good book
you could read.

10:01.284 --> 10:04.202
Thanks, but I watch the
Charlie Brown Christmas special

10:04.204 --> 10:06.120
every year, so I get the gist.

10:06.122 --> 10:08.489
I bet your mom
is really proud of you.

10:08.491 --> 10:09.791
Nope.

10:09.793 --> 10:11.375
She says if I don't back out

10:11.377 --> 10:13.327
she's going to go
on a hunger strike.

10:13.329 --> 10:14.829
It would take years before

10:14.831 --> 10:17.498
she'd be in any kind of danger,
but still.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.384
I've got a treat
for us tomorrow, Mom.

10:20.386 --> 10:21.636
I'm taking you

10:21.638 --> 10:24.388
to see Saul Perlmutter
give a lecture

10:24.390 --> 10:26.424
about his Nobel Prize-winning
work in cosmology.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.758
And the best part is,

10:27.760 --> 10:29.644
at the Q and A afterward,

10:29.646 --> 10:31.179
I've worked up
a couple of "Q's"

10:31.181 --> 10:34.065
that will stump
his sorry "A."

10:35.100 --> 10:36.734
I don't know, Shelly.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.853
I thought we could do
a little sightseeing.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.472
What sight is better
than your little boy

10:41.474 --> 10:43.875
embarrassing a Nobel laureate?

10:43.877 --> 10:45.976
Come on, Sheldon,
we'll take your mom

10:45.978 --> 10:47.662
to see the Hollywood sign,

10:47.664 --> 10:49.480
the wax museum,
the Walk of Fame.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.616
Ooh, maybe
a little Rodeo Drive.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.785
Well, I can't spend
$12,000 on a handbag,

10:54.787 --> 10:56.654
but it's free
to look upon those

10:56.656 --> 10:59.157
who do with righteous
condemnation.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.093
What do you say?

11:02.095 --> 11:04.178
What do I say?

11:04.180 --> 11:06.964
I say you people need
to stop ruining my mom's visit

11:06.966 --> 11:10.935
with your sushi, and your
sadness and your slutty shirts.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.104
Stop it.

11:16.358 --> 11:19.644
He's not talking about your
shirt. Your shirt is fine.

11:26.907 --> 11:28.656
These are delicious.

11:28.657 --> 11:30.941
The trick to pancakes
is bacon grease.

11:30.943 --> 11:33.193
I cook everything in it.

11:33.195 --> 11:35.996
Everything? Aren't you
worried about your health?

11:35.998 --> 11:38.331
Oh, doctors are always
changing their mind.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.033
One week bacon grease
is bad for you.

11:40.035 --> 11:42.919
The next week we're not
getting enough of it.

11:43.955 --> 11:46.206
Good morning, Shelly.

11:46.208 --> 11:50.176
Mom, I want to apologize
for my behavior last night.

11:50.178 --> 11:52.545
- Apology accepted.
- Great.

11:52.547 --> 11:54.497
Now, you're going to love
the Perlmutter lecture.

11:54.499 --> 11:57.517
Look, he will be stating
that the universe is older

11:57.519 --> 11:59.135
than 6,000 years,
but I thought

11:59.137 --> 12:00.804
you could stick your
fingers in your ears

12:00.806 --> 12:03.607
and hum "Amazing Grace"
during those parts.

12:03.609 --> 12:06.359
I am still going out
with your friends.

12:06.361 --> 12:08.612
But I apologized.

12:08.614 --> 12:12.365
And that was hard for me because
I didn't do anything wrong.

12:13.567 --> 12:18.071
Shelly, I hung out with you
in enough dusty lecture halls

12:18.073 --> 12:19.990
while you were growing up.

12:19.992 --> 12:21.207
I want to go sightseeing.

12:21.209 --> 12:22.692
So why don't you
have some pancakes,

12:22.694 --> 12:23.860
get dressed and come with us.

12:23.862 --> 12:27.414
I'm not going,
and you can't make me.

12:27.416 --> 12:31.134
You're right, I can't.
Have a nice day.

12:31.136 --> 12:34.054
Well, I'm going to stand here
until you change your mind.

12:34.056 --> 12:36.306
Well, then you are going
to stand there all day.

12:38.559 --> 12:43.229
I'm just gonna take my bacon
grease and slide over there.

12:43.231 --> 12:46.349
I can't believe my own
mother is abandoning me.

12:46.351 --> 12:48.518
I am not abandoning you.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.770
Sheldon, abandoning you
is leaving you in a basket

12:50.772 --> 12:52.072
on a church doorstep.

12:52.074 --> 12:56.743
I am going to Hollywood and
thank a wax Ronald Reagan

12:56.745 --> 12:59.062
for his service
to our country.

13:01.231 --> 13:03.867
We appear to be at a crossroads
in our relationship, Mother.

13:03.869 --> 13:05.502
Well, I guess we are.

13:05.504 --> 13:07.704
Sorry.
Syrup.

13:08.506 --> 13:10.040
All right, Mom.

13:10.042 --> 13:13.009
When you're at the Ripley's
Believe It Or Not Museum,

13:13.011 --> 13:16.412
if they have an exhibit about a
mother who threw away a chance

13:16.414 --> 13:18.581
to spend the day with the
world's most wonderful son,

13:18.583 --> 13:20.300
believe it,
because it's true.

13:22.887 --> 13:25.355
I hadn't...

13:26.507 --> 13:29.225
That lecture was
a waste of time.

13:29.227 --> 13:31.144
I made more accurate diagrams

13:31.146 --> 13:33.730
of the expansion of the early
universe on the nursery wall

13:33.732 --> 13:35.765
with the contents
of my diaper.

13:37.736 --> 13:39.402
Are you getting sick?

13:39.404 --> 13:41.654
No, I'm just allergic to people

13:41.656 --> 13:44.574
who get Nobel Prizes
for no good reason.

13:44.576 --> 13:47.660
Sheldon, is it possible
that your foul mood--

13:47.662 --> 13:51.965
or, to use the clinical
term, bitchiness--

13:51.967 --> 13:54.718
is because your mother
isn't making you a priority?

13:54.720 --> 13:59.923
No. Or to use the
clinical term, "nuh-uh""

14:00.841 --> 14:02.809
Are you sure?
The infant-mother pair-bond

14:02.811 --> 14:04.194
is the building block
of primate psychology.

14:04.196 --> 14:05.311
Oh, there it is.

14:05.313 --> 14:07.263
It always comes back
to monkeys with you.

14:07.265 --> 14:10.299
Just monkeys,
monkeys, monkeys.

14:10.301 --> 14:12.519
Sheldon, we're all animals.

14:12.521 --> 14:15.071
And granted, there are aspects
of you that are extraordinary,

14:15.073 --> 14:17.473
but when it comes to
emotions and relationships,

14:17.475 --> 14:18.775
you're just like everybody else.

14:18.777 --> 14:21.861
Are you trying to suggest
that my emotional problems

14:21.863 --> 14:25.665
are no different than
those of a stupid person?

14:25.667 --> 14:27.751
Actually, some research
indicates

14:27.753 --> 14:29.035
that by not overthinking,

14:29.037 --> 14:31.171
the less intelligent
handle emotions better.

14:34.091 --> 14:35.759
Sure you're not coming
down with a cold?

14:35.761 --> 14:37.844
Oh, yes, the common cold.

14:37.846 --> 14:38.962
Just like everyone else.

14:38.964 --> 14:40.346
You'd love that,
wouldn't you?

14:42.767 --> 14:45.635
Oh, this one's sweet.

14:45.637 --> 14:48.972
You know,
for your rosary rattlers.

14:48.974 --> 14:54.694
Mrs. Cooper, we say "Catholics""
not "rosary rattlers."

14:54.696 --> 14:56.646
My goodness, it's a wonder
you people in California

14:56.648 --> 14:57.981
can talk at all.

14:59.533 --> 15:01.401
This is like the
worst Hollywood tour ever.

15:01.403 --> 15:03.486
What are we gonna do?
She wanted to see churches.

15:03.488 --> 15:06.406
Hey, they have wine
here, don't they?

15:08.859 --> 15:12.528
None of our gods
have abs like that.

15:12.530 --> 15:15.398
Yep, that's the last
Jew who did sit-ups.

15:16.533 --> 15:19.135
And look where it got him.

15:20.454 --> 15:23.473
Hey, while we're here, why
don't we all do some praying?

15:23.475 --> 15:25.608
Let's put a little
church in this church.

15:25.610 --> 15:27.043
Oh, I'm not sure we should...

15:27.045 --> 15:29.212
It's easy.
I'll show you how.

15:29.214 --> 15:30.814
Lord, Mary Cooper here.

15:30.816 --> 15:34.267
Coming to you from
Gomorrah, California.

15:34.269 --> 15:35.935
I want to thank you

15:35.937 --> 15:38.688
for the blessing that
is my little Shelly.

15:38.690 --> 15:41.574
I also want to thank you
for the continued strength

15:41.576 --> 15:44.744
not to coldcock him
with my Bible.

15:46.030 --> 15:48.397
All right, Penny, your turn.

15:48.399 --> 15:50.166
Okay, um...

15:50.168 --> 15:51.167
Hey, God.

15:51.169 --> 15:53.837
What's up?

15:53.839 --> 15:57.257
Um, I'm good, but, uh, it would
be a big help to my family

15:57.259 --> 15:59.459
if you could get my brother
to stop cooking meth.

16:02.163 --> 16:05.014
But no cops. Be cool.

16:06.517 --> 16:10.253
She also goes a little overboard
on the "love thy neighbor."

16:10.255 --> 16:13.857
Could probably use that chat
you had with Mary Magdalene.

16:13.859 --> 16:15.859
Leonard, you're up.

16:15.861 --> 16:17.727
Wasserman, you're on deck.

16:17.729 --> 16:19.445
Okay. I don't know...

16:19.447 --> 16:24.534
it's probably a little late
to ask you to make me taller.

16:28.122 --> 16:31.124
Oh, um... if you could help
out with me and my girlfriend.

16:31.126 --> 16:33.376
She's all the way in India.
That would be great.

16:33.378 --> 16:34.627
Hear that? Girl trouble.

16:34.629 --> 16:37.413
Turns out we were both wrong
on that front.

16:40.801 --> 16:42.302
How about you?

16:42.304 --> 16:43.670
Oh, me? No.
Thanks, I'm good.

16:43.672 --> 16:47.456
I'm really just trying not
to burst into flames.

16:49.727 --> 16:51.177
Rajesh?

16:53.681 --> 16:57.567
He says he's having trouble
dropping those last five pounds.

16:57.569 --> 17:01.571
Huh, I might have gone with
the talking-to-girls thing.

17:03.157 --> 17:05.157
No, you only get one wish.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:22.843 --> 17:25.811
Look at the two of us.

17:25.814 --> 17:28.831
Me, a highly
regarded physicist.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.017
The kind of mind that
comes along once,

17:31.019 --> 17:33.102
maybe twice in a generation.

17:33.104 --> 17:35.504
You, the common man,

17:35.506 --> 17:39.142
tired from your labors
as a stockbroker,

17:39.144 --> 17:43.346
or vacuum cleaner salesman,
or bootblack.

17:44.848 --> 17:47.516
But deep down inside...

17:47.518 --> 17:50.153
apparently we're just
two peas in a pod.

17:50.155 --> 17:53.206
A regular pea,

17:53.208 --> 17:55.875
and the kind of pea
that comes along once,

17:55.877 --> 17:58.244
maybe twice in a generation.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.699
Rain.

18:03.701 --> 18:06.135
Another great equalizer.

18:06.137 --> 18:08.004
Falling on the head
of the brilliant

18:08.006 --> 18:10.139
and the unremarkable alike.

18:17.181 --> 18:19.382
Smarty-pants.

18:22.853 --> 18:25.221
Oh, Mrs. Cooper,
it smells so good.

18:25.223 --> 18:26.439
You take notes, darlin'.

18:26.441 --> 18:28.858
The real way to get a man
is with melted cheese

18:28.860 --> 18:30.660
and cream of mushroom soup.

18:30.662 --> 18:34.330
He'll die at 50 but
his love will be true.

18:39.003 --> 18:41.237
I need a tissue.
This one got wet.

18:44.408 --> 18:45.625
Here.

18:45.627 --> 18:49.178
Thank you. Yeah, I've
learned something today.

18:49.180 --> 18:53.049
You and I, in so many ways,

18:53.051 --> 18:56.352
other than intelligence and
what counts, we're the same.

18:58.589 --> 19:01.190
Sweetheart, are you sick?

19:01.192 --> 19:04.093
I hope so, because if this is
well, life isn't worth living.

19:04.095 --> 19:07.397
Oh, sugarpie,
you are burning up.

19:07.399 --> 19:09.649
- We've got to get you to bed.
- Okay.

19:09.651 --> 19:12.101
Don't worry. Mama's here
to take care of her baby.

19:12.103 --> 19:16.205
And just to be clear,
only her baby

19:16.207 --> 19:17.490
and not these other people.

19:17.492 --> 19:19.442
Of course.

19:19.444 --> 19:22.879
Can I have tea with honey and
toast with the crust cut off?

19:22.881 --> 19:25.498
You can have
whatever you want.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.384
Thanks, Mom.
You're the best.

19:39.741 --> 19:41.654
Boy, last time I put
VapoRub on you,

19:41.655 --> 19:44.606
you didn't have hair
on your chest.

19:44.608 --> 19:47.910
I know, it filled in last year.

19:49.963 --> 19:52.881
I didn't get to spend a lot of
time with you on this visit.

19:52.883 --> 19:54.967
And whose fault was that?

19:55.785 --> 19:57.953
Yours.

19:59.138 --> 20:01.306
Shelly, you're not eight
years old anymore.

20:01.308 --> 20:03.225
We have to have
a different relationship.

20:03.227 --> 20:05.143
No, we don't.

20:05.145 --> 20:06.645
The one we have
works great.

20:06.647 --> 20:08.347
Sweetheart, you are a grown man.

20:08.349 --> 20:10.799
Or maybe I'm part of
a new species,

20:10.801 --> 20:12.684
that lives for
hundreds of years,

20:12.686 --> 20:15.771
which means I'm still
basically a toddler.

20:15.773 --> 20:18.974
Oh, I so should have
taken you to Houston.

20:22.579 --> 20:24.997
Does this mean you're not
going to sing "Soft Kitty"?

20:24.999 --> 20:28.617
No, I will always
sing you "Soft Kitty."

Get out!

20:41.097 --> 20:42.097
