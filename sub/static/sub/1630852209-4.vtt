WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.935
- [Jason] This is Peaches.
- [Caroline] Here you go, bud.

00:02.937 --> 00:05.537
[Kathleen Lamattina] <i>Because our
animals get really close to people,</i>

00:05.539 --> 00:07.906
<i>we are planning on him
getting his vaccination.</i>

00:07.908 --> 00:10.376
<i>What's different this year,
he's about 100 pounds.</i>

00:10.443 --> 00:12.044
[man 1] What happened?

00:12.046 --> 00:14.947
[Leela Samaroo] <i>Our Red-Crested
Turaco chick has been giving us trouble</i>

00:14.949 --> 00:16.448
<i>for quite some time now.</i>

00:16.450 --> 00:19.251
You could see the parents
looking for the chick.

00:19.253 --> 00:23.022
This is the first time that
Babatunde's been anaesthetized.

00:24.491 --> 00:25.891
[growling]

00:25.893 --> 00:28.927
He's a silverback gorilla.
His instinct is to bite.

00:28.929 --> 00:31.363
[Sabrina] We're all gonna
behave, right?

00:33.466 --> 00:35.901
[Jim Breheny] <i>If you ask a
child to draw a picture of a zoo,</i>

00:35.903 --> 00:39.571
<i>chances are they'll draw
an animal behind bars.</i>

00:39.573 --> 00:43.008
We've got to take that image
and change it.

00:43.010 --> 00:46.412
<i>I really enjoy this. It strengthens the
bond that we have with these guys.</i>

00:47.781 --> 00:49.148
Come on. I know,
you don't like doors.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.749
[woman 1] Come on, ladies.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.218
<i>[Jim] It's not enough to keep
animals and exhibit</i>

00:53.220 --> 00:54.553
<i>just for people to look at.</i>

00:54.555 --> 00:57.089
<i>There has to be a higher
purpose, and for us,</i>

00:57.091 --> 00:59.358
<i>it's conservation of species
in the wild.</i>

00:59.360 --> 01:01.326
[man 2] Are you rolling?

01:01.328 --> 01:03.896
<i>[Jim] The general public would
never get the access you're gonna get.</i>

01:03.898 --> 01:05.864
- [woman 2] Good girl!
<i>- [Jim] Which is to see</i>

01:05.866 --> 01:09.101
<i>what goes on
behind the scenes everyday.</i>

01:09.103 --> 01:11.537
That's how we do it here
in the Boogie Down Bronx.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.272
[all laughing]

01:18.078 --> 01:20.079
- [man 3] Look at the other one there.
- [woman 3] Say hi.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.147
- [woman 4] Oh, oh, oh.
- [kid 1] Cool.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.984
[kid 2] Look at that one
over there.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.887
-[birds chirping] -[Leela Samaroo]
Come here. You just stay right here.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.056
The marsh exhibit is
our African bird exhibit

01:31.058 --> 01:32.925
at the Aquatic Bird House.

01:32.927 --> 01:36.295
It houses our African species.
Crested Coua,

01:36.297 --> 01:39.998
<i>African Spoonbills,
Madagascar Crested Ibis,</i>

01:40.000 --> 01:41.133
<i>Pied avocet,</i>

01:41.135 --> 01:42.768
<i>our Red-Crested Turacos.</i>

01:42.770 --> 01:44.803
<i>I like the exhibit
mostly because</i>

01:44.805 --> 01:47.706
<i>it's very colorful and I know
what it is this time of year,</i>

01:47.708 --> 01:49.975
we're gonna have
tons of babies in there.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.049
This'll be our fruit salad
for our Turacos.

01:57.051 --> 02:00.752
It's a mix of apples,
pears, carrots,

02:00.754 --> 02:05.891
string beans, peas
and some fresh whole fruits.

02:05.893 --> 02:09.928
The Latin name for Turaco
actually means banana eater.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.498
We've got to give them
what their names sake is.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.837
All right, and we're off
to feed these guys.

02:18.839 --> 02:22.141
<i>Ever since I came here as a kid, I
knew I wanted to work at the Bronx Zoo.</i>

02:23.977 --> 02:26.178
<i>In college, I was pre vet,</i>

02:26.180 --> 02:28.013
<i>but I had an internship here...</i>

02:28.015 --> 02:29.348
Hi.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.150
<i>and I just loved
what the keepers did.</i>

02:31.152 --> 02:31.783
Hello.

02:31.785 --> 02:32.951
<i>Just feeding the animals</i>

02:32.953 --> 02:35.687
<i>and getting to know them
and interacting with them</i>

02:35.689 --> 02:38.724
<i>I loved it so much more than
working in the hospital setting.</i>

02:38.726 --> 02:40.926
And so I thought, okay,
well, maybe this is what I

02:40.928 --> 02:43.228
actually wanted all along
was to be a keeper.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.032
Oh, and you could get
a peek right here.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.668
That's the Red-Crested Turacos.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.003
There are male and female pair.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.839
Male and female are about
the same color.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.108
The female's just
a little smaller.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.043
They are an African species.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.612
Most of the population is
found in jungle

03:00.614 --> 03:03.182
and densely forested areas.

03:06.586 --> 03:10.689
We first realized that they had
inclination of a breeding season

03:10.691 --> 03:13.091
because we found a broken egg
in the pool one day.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.194
<i>We're like, "Oh, my gosh,
they're ready.</i>

03:15.196 --> 03:16.995
<i>Let's got some stuff
set up for them."</i>

03:16.997 --> 03:18.797
<i>So we had gotten a black tub,</i>

03:18.799 --> 03:20.766
<i>mounted it to a bracket
and put it up.</i>

03:20.768 --> 03:23.468
<i>And sure enough,
after a couple weeks or so,</i>

03:23.470 --> 03:26.772
<i>we saw eggs in the nest tub.</i>

03:26.774 --> 03:29.942
These birds spook very easily
and if they don't feel safe,

03:29.944 --> 03:33.078
they will abandon
or throw the egg.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.014
<i>So once it was close to like
the hatch date,</i>

03:36.016 --> 03:37.983
<i>we just stopped checking.</i>

03:37.985 --> 03:40.052
<i>So the last Red-Crested
Turaco chick,</i>

03:40.054 --> 03:42.154
<i>I believe hatched
in the late '80s,</i>

03:42.156 --> 03:44.356
so I'm hoping for babies.

03:49.796 --> 03:50.829
[woman 5] Look right there.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.431
So cool, is it?

03:57.203 --> 03:58.904
[Donna-Mae Butcher]
They came in October, right?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.472
[Terria Clay speaking]

04:02.375 --> 04:03.809
[Donna-Mae] Hey, sweet stuff.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.844
Come on.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.547
<i>We're here at the Health
Centre of the Bronx today,</i>

04:08.549 --> 04:11.483
<i>we're gonna do a training
session with the puma cubs.</i>

04:11.485 --> 04:14.386
<i>The game plan is
to get them as comfortable</i>

04:14.388 --> 04:17.889
to coming to the crate
with myself present

04:17.891 --> 04:20.192
<i>to eventually bring them to their
new home at the Queens Zoo.</i>

04:20.194 --> 04:22.127
- Come on, buddy.
- [Terria] All right.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.195
[Donna-Mae] Come on, bud.

04:23.197 --> 04:25.497
<i>I first saw them last fall
when they came in.</i>

04:25.499 --> 04:27.232
<i>So they were kittens.</i>

04:30.069 --> 04:31.203
[Craig] I know.

04:31.205 --> 04:34.039
<i>We have got the call,
and I was told that there were</i>

04:34.041 --> 04:36.308
three orphan puma cubs in Utah,

04:36.310 --> 04:38.677
<i>and that if we could take
them, they're ready to go.</i>

04:38.679 --> 04:40.279
[woman 6] Hi.

04:42.515 --> 04:44.683
- [Donna-Mae] Good job, bud.
- [Terria] Good boy.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.185
-[Donna-Mae] I know. Who is this person?
-[Terria] Good boy.

04:47.187 --> 04:50.789
We initially had them trained
just before the lockdown,

04:50.791 --> 04:52.624
so they were ready to go
in March.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.893
<i>And so we had to wait.</i>

04:54.895 --> 04:56.995
<i>And now that the restrictions
have been lifted,</i>

04:56.997 --> 04:58.997
<i>we were able to resume training,</i>

04:58.999 --> 05:01.566
which was now starting
from the beginning.

05:01.568 --> 05:04.202
- Terria, I'm not going to stay still. Okay?
- [Terria] Okay.

05:04.204 --> 05:07.172
[Donna-Mae] <i>During the
training sessions, what I will do</i>

05:07.174 --> 05:08.840
<i>is move around the crate,</i>

05:08.842 --> 05:11.810
<i>jiggle the doors a little bit
and I move stuff around.</i>

05:11.812 --> 05:15.380
<i>It's just sort of desensitize
them to sudden noises,</i>

05:15.382 --> 05:16.848
<i>- sudden movements...
- [Terria] Good boy.</i>

05:16.850 --> 05:19.051
Because at the day of crating,
you just never know

05:19.053 --> 05:20.485
what can and will go wrong.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.922
- Yeah, moving stuff around, see?
- [Terria] Target.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.857
When we got the puma cubs
of the Bronx Zoo,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.859
there were three of them,

05:27.861 --> 05:31.063
<i>and the plan was to transition
them to the Queens Zoo.</i>

05:31.065 --> 05:33.031
<i>So they had to be kind of
be acclimated,</i>

05:33.033 --> 05:35.867
<i>and we just have to make sure
that they were healthy.</i>

05:35.869 --> 05:37.836
<i>Unfortunately,
during one of the kind of</i>

05:37.838 --> 05:40.739
<i>routine medical procedures,
one of the females</i>

05:40.741 --> 05:44.676
<i>died under anesthesia,
and it was just a heartbreak.</i>

05:44.678 --> 05:48.146
But I know, you know, rationally
that if we had not taken the cats,

05:48.148 --> 05:49.781
they all would have
been euthanized.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.984
So it's a shame we lost
that female.

05:52.986 --> 05:56.855
But I'm really happy that we were able
to provide a home for these two cats.

05:56.857 --> 05:57.823
[Donna-Mae] Good job.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.925
[Terria] You finished
everything, buddy.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.361
[Donna-Mae] And your sister's
going to be equally as great.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.732
[Terria] Hi, girl.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.101
- What are you doing?
- [Donna-Mae] Hey, Mama.

06:09.103 --> 06:11.069
[Terria] Let's go
in the crate. Come on.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.304
[clicks tongue]

06:12.872 --> 06:14.106
Good girl.

06:14.108 --> 06:16.908
- [Donna-Mae] Nice.
- [Terria] Good girl.

06:16.910 --> 06:20.145
I'm so excited for them
to experience Queens

06:20.147 --> 06:24.049
in a bigger space and be on view so
that other people can get to see them.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.684
[Donna-Mae] And she's eating
well from you.

06:25.686 --> 06:30.021
- She's focused on you.
- [Terria] Yes, she's looking at the food.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.923
[Donna-Mae] I'm just gonna
step to my left for a second.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.225
[Terria] Yeah,
she's watching you.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.694
[Donna-Mae laughs heartily]
Miss Cautious.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.295
[Terria] I'm gonna end it

06:37.297 --> 06:39.297
- before she walks away.
- [Donna-Mae] Yes. Absolutely.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.299
[Terria] Here you go, girl.
You're done.

06:42.034 --> 06:43.402
Leaving the crate.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.071
The next step for the cubs
is to continue

06:46.073 --> 06:48.740
with the training sessions
until both cubs go into

06:48.742 --> 06:50.675
the crate comfortably
and stress free.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.345
<i>Once we are happy
with how they look in there,</i>

06:53.347 --> 06:54.980
<i>that's when we'll move them
to the Queens Zoo.</i>

06:54.982 --> 06:57.115
[Terria] Okay, perfect.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.184
- [Donna-Mae] All right.
- [Terria] She did great.

07:01.854 --> 07:04.523
-[woman 7] There they are. You see them?
-[girl] Uh-huh.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.425
[woman 8] You want to see?

07:10.797 --> 07:11.863
[Sabrina Squillari]
This is the Bronx Zoo,

07:11.865 --> 07:14.166
Congo Gorilla Forest.

07:14.168 --> 07:16.501
<i>We're going to check on our
two gorilla groups</i>

07:16.503 --> 07:18.203
<i>who are outside today.</i>

07:20.206 --> 07:22.107
They like to be camera ready.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.176
Suki.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.211
Hi.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.113
<i>They were from
New York City, Queens,</i>

07:28.115 --> 07:31.716
<i>and my mom would take me here
every weekend.</i>

07:31.718 --> 07:33.084
[laughs]

07:33.086 --> 07:35.387
And I just would see
the zookeepers and say,

07:35.389 --> 07:37.155
"One day, that's gonna be me."

07:37.824 --> 07:38.757
Oh.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.492
Oh. [laughs]

07:41.727 --> 07:46.231
<i>I got put with primates
and I just fell in love.</i>

07:46.233 --> 07:48.400
That's really cute. [chuckles]

07:49.869 --> 07:51.136
Hi.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.272
We're all gonna behave, right?

07:55.107 --> 07:56.741
We're on the roof.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.910
We call this the Gorilla Roof.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.879
It's a way for the keepers to
have visual access

08:00.881 --> 08:03.515
on checking on the gorillas.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.785
<i>Our bachelor group
has four males in it,</i>

08:06.787 --> 08:09.187
<i>between the ages of 14 and 15,</i>

08:09.189 --> 08:11.890
<i>and they've been together
about seven years now.</i>

08:11.924 --> 08:12.924
[laughs]

08:12.926 --> 08:14.726
Down there, we have Baraka.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.062
He's our largest gorilla here.

08:17.064 --> 08:19.798
And Johari,
he's our oldest bachelor.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.132
He's also the smallest.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.501
He's like our little teddy bear.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.336
Hi, bubba.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.137
Then there is M'Domo.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.507
What's that?

08:28.509 --> 08:29.808
Are you displaying?

08:29.810 --> 08:31.276
Are you gonna eat the bark?

08:32.845 --> 08:35.180
Look at these boys, standoff.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.083
Being that this is
a bachelor group of males,

08:38.085 --> 08:40.185
like coming into their own,

08:40.187 --> 08:41.920
there's a lot of displaying.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.855
So you see, when they have
their arms

08:43.857 --> 08:45.657
stiff like that
and their lips pursed?

08:45.659 --> 08:48.126
It's a kind of a display.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.895
And then once they get that
out of their system,

08:49.897 --> 08:53.865
they'll settle down for the
day and take naps and forage.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.835
So there's Babatunde up
in the back.

08:56.837 --> 09:00.539
He's probably the most
cautious of the four bachelors.

09:01.841 --> 09:04.476
Hey, Baba, are you surveying
the land?

09:05.511 --> 09:08.146
<i>Working with Babatunde is</i>

09:08.148 --> 09:09.948
<i>a really fun
and amazing experience.</i>

09:09.950 --> 09:11.116
Hey. [chuckles]

09:12.952 --> 09:16.121
<i>But it takes a little bit
longer to gain the trust</i>

09:16.123 --> 09:18.023
<i>and make him be comfortable.</i>

09:18.025 --> 09:19.257
Open.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.126
<i>We had done the training set.</i>

09:21.128 --> 09:22.928
Open. Let me see that tooth.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.897
<i>And we're able to see that
his tooth was injured</i>

09:25.899 --> 09:27.899
<i>and the vet determined that
we would need to</i>

09:27.901 --> 09:30.936
<i>have it looked at
by a specialist.</i>

09:30.938 --> 09:33.905
There's always a level of concern
when any animal undergoes

09:33.907 --> 09:36.608
a procedure involving
anesthesia.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.811
<i>But Babatunde being
that he is extra cautious,</i>

09:39.813 --> 09:42.480
<i>we want to make sure that
he's comfortable</i>

09:42.482 --> 09:45.817
and we're hopeful that maybe
his tooth can be saved.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.987
This means mugging up there.

09:51.223 --> 09:54.960
[Chuck] Right now, the parents
know that the chick went to the ground.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.429
Hopefully, we can
do this quickly.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.898
How high is it?

09:59.900 --> 10:03.001
- Welcome to Queens!
- Thank you very much.

10:03.003 --> 10:07.205
All these new smells and sounds
from the public and other animals.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.975
For now, we need them to
get very comfortable.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.082
- [laughs]
- [indistinct chatter]

10:40.139 --> 10:41.906
We knew the parents had
some eggs in their nest tub.

10:41.908 --> 10:45.877
<i>So we just kind of let time pass and
hope that a chick would have hatched</i>

10:45.879 --> 10:48.346
and they were like, "Hey, it's
kind of been about a week now.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.016
We should just go see
what's up with the eggs."

10:51.018 --> 10:52.784
And sure enough, we got a hatch,

10:52.786 --> 10:54.386
<i>we found him on the ground,</i>

10:54.420 --> 10:57.856
<i>just sitting next to the pool.
We had to scoop him up</i>

10:57.858 --> 11:00.392
<i>and take him downstairs, and
he was just begging for food.</i>

11:00.960 --> 11:02.560
You got this. Whoa!

11:02.562 --> 11:04.095
<i>[Leela] It's been about 30 years</i>

11:04.097 --> 11:06.531
<i>since our last Red-Crested
Turaco chick hatched,</i>

11:06.533 --> 11:09.834
so it's the first chick
of a lot of newer keepers here

11:09.836 --> 11:14.172
<i>and I think it's a very amazing
thing, you know, to experience.</i>

11:15.641 --> 11:18.677
You could see the parents
looking for the chick.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.145
The parents are looking
for the chick.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.880
They know that their
chick fledge.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.014
Then it went to the ground

11:23.016 --> 11:26.084
and hopefully,
we can do this quickly.

11:30.489 --> 11:33.158
This current nest that we have
is pretty bare.

11:33.160 --> 11:37.829
If we just put the bird back in the nest,
we may end up with the same result.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.865
So what we're planning on doing is
trying to expand the footprint of that nest

11:40.867 --> 11:44.169
<i>by adding some branches
so that it has a spot to go</i>

11:44.171 --> 11:46.738
<i>and it can come and go from
the nest of the branching as it likes.</i>

11:46.740 --> 11:48.940
[birds chirping]

11:48.942 --> 11:50.308
We got that ladder,
right? Easy.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.143
- [man 4] Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.714
Yeah.

11:55.716 --> 11:58.116
We're trying to move quickly
to get the perches installed

11:58.118 --> 11:59.050
and get it ready to put him back

11:59.052 --> 12:00.652
because the longer they're
out of the nest

12:00.654 --> 12:03.321
the more likely it is that
parents may not come back to it.

12:06.325 --> 12:09.260
Cool. I think we're ready
for baby.

12:09.628 --> 12:10.729
Let's go get the chick.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.907
The adults saw the chick,
and that's some vocalizing,

12:22.909 --> 12:25.110
so anxious to get to it.

12:26.979 --> 12:29.581
<i>There's still a lot of hurdles
left for this bird,</i>

12:29.583 --> 12:31.783
<i>even though it's already come
so far.</i>

12:31.785 --> 12:35.553
<i>Over the course of the next few days,
we'll keep a real close eye on the exhibit</i>

12:35.555 --> 12:37.822
<i>and the chick and the parents
and just make sure</i>

12:37.824 --> 12:41.059
<i>that the parents are accepting
it and taking care of the chick</i>

12:41.061 --> 12:43.495
and that the chick's not
getting into any trouble.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.402
[indistinct chatter]

13:00.279 --> 13:02.480
- Morning.
- [Donna-Mae] Good morning.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.083
Hey, hey.

13:05.085 --> 13:08.520
<i>It's a great day today because
we're bringing the puma cubs</i>

13:08.687 --> 13:10.989
<i>from the Bronx Zoo,
home to Queens Zoo.</i>

13:10.991 --> 13:12.891
The cubs
crate trained perfectly.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.592
They were very cooperative.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.294
Everything couldn't have
gone smoother,

13:16.296 --> 13:19.164
<i>and we were able to move it
along within a week.</i>

13:20.232 --> 13:21.366
[Terria] Hi, boy.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.168
What's up?

13:24.770 --> 13:28.373
Both cats will be crated
and they'll go to Queens Zoo.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.842
Where they'll get to go on
exhibit and, you know, experience

13:30.844 --> 13:32.777
grass and dirt and trees.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.579
<i>It's a really great ending,
I hope</i>

13:34.581 --> 13:36.214
<i>of a long journey.</i>

13:36.216 --> 13:38.049
- [Donna-Mae] What's up, buddy?
- [Terria] Hi, buddy.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.284
Are you hungry?

13:39.286 --> 13:41.152
Look what I have for you.

13:41.687 --> 13:45.156
Some food. So, I mean...

13:45.158 --> 13:49.027
[Donna-Mae] Wow,
you are unbelievable.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.995
[Terria] He just does not care.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.997
Plan is, he's still
interested in eating

13:52.999 --> 13:55.500
once the door's closed,
keep feeding him

13:55.768 --> 13:58.770
<i>which will keep him more
relaxed when we're moving them.</i>

13:58.772 --> 13:59.804
[Terria] Good man.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.639
What a good boy you are.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.875
[Donna-Mae] <i>And do the
same thing with the female.</i>

14:03.877 --> 14:06.110
[Terria] Want to come
in the crate, girl?

14:07.046 --> 14:08.980
- Good girl. [laughs]
- [Donna-Mae] Okay.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.520
Hoo! Yay.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.191
It's bittersweet.
It's a good and a sad feeling.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.627
Yes, thank you.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.629
<i>I will certainly visit them.</i>

14:24.631 --> 14:26.764
I'll look forward to
seeing them on exhibit.

14:26.766 --> 14:30.501
No, no tears from you
guys, all right? No tears.

14:30.803 --> 14:34.038
[Terria] Maybe I'll go in the
bathroom and shed one, but not now.

14:42.848 --> 14:45.283
[birds chirping]

14:47.820 --> 14:52.090
<i>[Sabrina] Today, Babatunde is
undergoing a medical procedure.</i>

14:52.092 --> 14:54.759
We are going to see if we can
save the tooth

14:54.761 --> 14:56.728
or if it has to be removed.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.663
That canine looks
little bit loose.

14:58.665 --> 15:02.200
<i>So we have our dental
consultant with us today.</i>

15:02.202 --> 15:05.370
<i>He will help us decide
what kind of care this need.</i>

15:06.505 --> 15:10.108
So we're here to work
on Babatunde.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.810
This is his first
immobilization in 14 years.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.913
We'll dart him initially.

15:14.915 --> 15:15.914
Series of two darts,

15:15.916 --> 15:19.017
hoping that will be enough
to get him down fully.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.719
We don't want the animals
we work with to associate us

15:21.721 --> 15:25.690
with any kind of negative
activity they have to go through.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.426
So after isolating him to
the enclosure,

15:28.428 --> 15:32.030
we need to move in
then I remove myself.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.734
[Dr. Robert Moore] Okay. So we've
got the barrel, we got the darts. Ready?

15:36.736 --> 15:37.535
- [Sabrina] We're ready.
- This way?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.771
[Sabrina] We got to go that way.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.206
<i>[Dr. Robert] Many large animal
immobilization is kind of a big deal,</i>

15:42.208 --> 15:45.043
but gorillas especially
they don't do anything easily.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.978
So darting is a challenge.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.379
<i>Anesthesia is a challenge.</i>

15:48.480 --> 15:51.916
So the fact that it is his first,
you know, makes it a little bit more

15:51.918 --> 15:55.086
kinda ratchet up the level
of anxiety a little bit. [laughs]

15:55.088 --> 15:56.421
Hey, Baba.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.499
[gorilla roars]

16:15.207 --> 16:16.674
Sorry, Baba.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.142
<i>He's a silverback gorilla.</i>

16:18.144 --> 16:21.079
His instinct is to fight,
or at least to show,

16:21.081 --> 16:23.081
you know, show strength,
show aggression.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.949
Trying to tell me, "Hey,
get the heck out of here.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.818
I don't want you around."

16:26.820 --> 16:29.220
So luckily, there was
something between us.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.460
[gorilla roars]

16:44.036 --> 16:45.069
Boy.

16:45.071 --> 16:46.838
He was not easy.

16:46.872 --> 16:48.940
So he's kind of worked up.

16:48.942 --> 16:53.177
Hopefully, the drugs will be
not kind of overridden by all that.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.013
[Sabrina] He's starting to
yawn more.

16:55.981 --> 16:57.915
<i>[Dr. Robert] He's showing
the first effect of the drug.</i>

16:57.917 --> 17:00.785
So he's doing
what he's supposed to do.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.154
<i>Now it's the difficult
waiting time.</i>

17:05.024 --> 17:07.058
Do you think we can do a
face test from the other side?

17:07.060 --> 17:09.160
[Dr. Robert] I think so.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.165
If he's still able to move,
he's still able to grab

17:14.167 --> 17:16.134
and he's still able to bite.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.803
<i>And so it's not safe for us</i>

17:18.805 --> 17:20.905
<i>to handle him
until he's completely still.</i>

17:20.907 --> 17:23.041
[Sabrina] No movement.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.943
-I don't see anything.
-[Dr. John Sykes] Pretty good to me.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.617
- [Sabrina] He's moving.
- What?

17:32.619 --> 17:35.019
[Sabrina] He's moving,
he's moving.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.160
- [Sabrina] He's moving.
- Close the way on the door.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.996
[Sabrina] He's moving.
Get ready on the door.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.865
You want us close?
Close, close.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.334
Close it, oh, my.

17:53.872 --> 17:54.705
[Dr. Robert] I'm giving
another gram of it.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.108
- Okay.
- At least.

17:57.110 --> 18:00.011
<i>[Dr. John] It's taking a very long
time to get Babatunde to go to sleep.</i>

18:00.013 --> 18:02.013
[Sabrina] Oh, no, don't sit up.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.916
<i>[Dr. John] But what doing is
we're choosing the medication</i>

18:04.918 --> 18:06.017
<i>that's the safest
and the best choice</i>

18:06.019 --> 18:08.786
<i>for the exam that we need
to do with him today,</i>

18:08.788 --> 18:13.091
and it'll take a long as it needs to
until we can get him under control.

18:23.902 --> 18:26.037
- [Dr. Robert] I think we're good, are we?
- I think so.

18:26.505 --> 18:28.239
[Sabrina grunts]

18:28.674 --> 18:30.274
You guys good? That's good.

18:30.276 --> 18:34.612
[Sabrina] He's heavy. He's
heavy. He's heavy. Okay. Whew!

18:34.614 --> 18:35.780
Yeah, that's fine.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.915
<i>Seeing Babatunde
under anesthesia</i>

18:37.917 --> 18:39.617
for the first time
is a bit concerning.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.153
<i>We want to make sure
everything's okay</i>

18:42.155 --> 18:46.257
<i>and been just waiting for what the
dentists and the vets have to say.</i>

18:46.259 --> 18:50.728
[Dr. Django Martel] This is too
broken, looks like a, looks like a--

18:50.730 --> 18:54.432
To just crack that tooth right
at the gum line the way he did,

18:54.434 --> 18:58.369
I cannot imagine the amount of
force that went into that.

18:58.371 --> 19:03.541
<i>So I imagine he's going to feel
better pretty quickly having that out.</i>

19:03.543 --> 19:05.743
Let me try to clean this up.

19:05.745 --> 19:09.881
The big question is, are we
going to be able to root canal

19:09.883 --> 19:14.085
this broken tooth
versus extract it?

19:14.087 --> 19:15.920
<i>I'm praying that we can
get in there</i>

19:15.922 --> 19:19.457
<i>do a much faster root canal,</i>

19:19.459 --> 19:23.127
<i>you know, easier for this
guy to recover from.</i>

19:23.129 --> 19:25.796
<i>[Dr. John] A lot of our animals
will put up with a lot of pain.</i>

19:25.798 --> 19:29.667
<i>If you broke your tooth
and your root was exposed,</i>

19:29.669 --> 19:31.969
you'd be calling your dentist
three times a minute

19:31.971 --> 19:34.338
just to find out when you
could get in to get it done.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.942
- [Dr. Django] So, John?
- [Dr. John] Yeah.

19:37.944 --> 19:40.244
[Dr. Django] I still feel
like a root canal is a better

19:40.246 --> 19:43.080
option than extraction.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.415
[Dr. John] Got it.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.085
Oh, that hurts.

19:48.087 --> 19:49.787
[Dr. Django] Yeah.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.989
Now you feel like
you're at the dentist.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.258
[machine whirring]

19:59.998 --> 20:01.799
- Done up.
- We done upfront.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.068
[Dr. John] <i>Everything went
really well with the procedure.</i>

20:04.070 --> 20:05.636
The whole root has been
filled up.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.639
He has a seal on the outside
of the tooth

20:08.641 --> 20:12.276
<i>and we're expecting that that
will take care of the problem.</i>

20:12.278 --> 20:14.512
<i>And he won't have any more
issues with this tooth.</i>

20:14.514 --> 20:16.747
[indistinct chatter]

20:16.749 --> 20:20.051
<i>[Sabrina] Whenever we do any
kind of medical immobilization</i>

20:20.053 --> 20:21.752
<i>with the gorilla or primates,</i>

20:21.754 --> 20:23.888
<i>there's usually
a period afterward</i>

20:23.890 --> 20:27.191
where you have to regain
some sort of trust with them.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.859
A lot of them can be forgiving

20:28.861 --> 20:31.996
but, Babatunde, it will probably

20:31.998 --> 20:35.099
<i>take a little bit longer
to gain that trust back.</i>

20:45.143 --> 20:47.245
[people laughing]

20:48.981 --> 20:51.082
Here you go, buddy.
He's coming out.

20:51.316 --> 20:53.084
Oh.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.052
Let's go, buddy.

20:55.054 --> 20:58.189
This is Peaches,
he is going outside.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.358
[snorting]

21:01.660 --> 21:03.995
- Who's that here?
- [Kathleen] Hi.

21:03.997 --> 21:06.864
<i>We all hanging out
with Peaches our warthog.</i>

21:06.866 --> 21:08.966
<i>That's good bonding
for all of us.</i>

21:08.968 --> 21:10.668
<i>Just to hang out
and sit with the pig.</i>

21:10.670 --> 21:13.871
I love you.
We'll play. [laughs]

21:13.873 --> 21:17.908
He wouldn't be social if he
was a male warthog in the wild.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.811
- And he just likes to be around us.
- Do you like that?

21:20.813 --> 21:22.246
[laughs]

21:22.248 --> 21:24.915
<i>[Kathleen] We're planning on
him getting his vaccinations.</i>

21:24.917 --> 21:25.983
Oh, you're good pig.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.718
I love you.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.388
Vaccines are important even
for your domestic animals.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.922
Your dogs and cats at home.

21:32.157 --> 21:35.559
They have to get vaccinated in the
same here at the Tractable Animal Building.

21:35.561 --> 21:36.827
[crowd exclaiming]

21:36.829 --> 21:39.230
<i>[Kathleen] Most of our animals
get really close to people.</i>

21:39.232 --> 21:41.932
<i>We want to make sure they are
vaccinated to keep them safe</i>

21:41.934 --> 21:43.634
<i>and also to keep you safe.</i>

21:43.636 --> 21:45.136
[all exclaiming]

21:45.138 --> 21:46.904
[Kathleen] Look
how good he looks.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.172
- [laughs]
- Peaches.

21:48.174 --> 21:49.340
Inside.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.108
Good boy.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.910
<i>[Kathleen] When Peaches
was smaller,</i>

21:52.912 --> 21:54.679
<i>we are able just to hold him.</i>

21:54.681 --> 21:56.247
<i>Talk to him, keep him calm.</i>

21:56.249 --> 21:59.016
<i>What's different this year,
he's about 100 pounds.</i>

21:59.618 --> 22:01.686
<i>We don't want to restrain him.</i>

22:01.688 --> 22:04.121
<i>So, Caroline fix some
of our training boxes</i>

22:04.123 --> 22:06.190
<i>and made a little squeeze
outside my office.</i>

22:06.192 --> 22:08.092
[Caroline Walsh] Hi, come on.

22:08.094 --> 22:12.096
Peaches is going to enter
into our makeshift squeeze.

22:12.098 --> 22:15.333
Hey, handsome.
Good boy, you go inside?

22:16.001 --> 22:18.035
I started training
and working with Peaches,

22:18.037 --> 22:21.072
probably within maybe
about a month

22:21.074 --> 22:22.006
<i>since I started working here.</i>

22:22.008 --> 22:23.708
Good, Peaches.

22:23.710 --> 22:27.278
<i>He is an animal that work
strictly with relationships.</i>

22:27.280 --> 22:29.513
<i>What I give him,
he gives right back to me.</i>

22:29.815 --> 22:31.082
Okay, good.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.018
It's just fun for me because
he's such an intelligent animal

22:34.020 --> 22:36.687
that we are able to have
those relationships.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.023
<i>He just has a really
fun personality.</i>

22:39.025 --> 22:41.759
Jason, can you get one
in the muscle area?

22:41.761 --> 22:42.827
-Yeah,
-[Jason] That's it.

22:42.829 --> 22:43.994
[Caroline] And like, hold it.

22:43.996 --> 22:46.297
- [Jason] Okay.
- Good, Peaches. Sit.

22:47.933 --> 22:51.001
Yeah, see that's what's
gonna-- Good boy.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.270
- We do that again and see?
- Yeah.

22:53.272 --> 22:56.107
<i>[Caroline] Jason right now
is just using feeding prongs.</i>

22:56.109 --> 22:57.174
<i>It's a pointy edge.</i>

22:57.176 --> 23:00.211
So it's pretty similar enough
in feeling for Peaches

23:00.213 --> 23:01.545
to at least get used to.

23:01.547 --> 23:05.649
<i>And we increase the pressure
that Jason is poking</i>

23:05.651 --> 23:08.919
so that it will feel like
in the exact amount of time

23:08.921 --> 23:11.789
that is going to
need to stick for.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.058
<i>So we're trying to mimic
the amount of time</i>

23:14.060 --> 23:15.092
<i>as well as the pressure.</i>

23:15.094 --> 23:16.494
That's a good boy.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.462
<i>As close as possible
to what we can.</i>

23:18.497 --> 23:20.965
[women laughing]

23:20.967 --> 23:23.801
- Is it all right if he heads back?
- [Kathleen] I think so.

23:23.803 --> 23:24.935
- [Jason] He's going back.
- [all laughing]

23:24.937 --> 23:27.104
[Caroline] Hey, right here.

23:27.839 --> 23:30.975
- He did good.
- [Jason] He did good. Yeah.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.977
[Kathleen] I think
if I could make one comment,

23:32.979 --> 23:34.044
I think if you,

23:34.046 --> 23:37.081
the sticker, actually says,
"Stay, touch."

23:37.083 --> 23:39.583
Yeah, because you're
looking at you for cue.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.986
- [Caroline] Mmm-hmm.
- I think if you just focus, you tell him when

23:41.988 --> 23:44.188
'cause you're in control
at the business end

23:44.190 --> 23:46.056
and then you say sticking.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.158
But that was good.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.360
We decided to probably
work it around

23:49.394 --> 23:50.895
maybe two more times.

23:50.897 --> 23:54.799
Um, I'll probably work it even
more honestly to just make sure that

23:54.801 --> 23:57.034
that he's really comfortable
and then we're gonna try it.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.602
- Nice job, guys.
- He's the best.

23:58.604 --> 24:01.038
[women laughing]

24:11.883 --> 24:14.118
-Welcome to Queens!
-[Donna-Mae] Oh. Thank you very much.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.386
You got some puma.

24:15.388 --> 24:17.021
[Donna-Mae]
We got some kitties.

24:19.925 --> 24:21.058
Lift.

24:22.894 --> 24:24.161
All right.

24:26.231 --> 24:28.032
- [man 5] Ready?
- [Raul] Yeah.

24:30.268 --> 24:31.869
- [Raul Vasquez] Are they out?
- [Donna-Mae] One's out.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.938
One's out. The boy's out.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.906
- [Raul] I like that.
- [man 5] All right.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.142
And we got puma. All right.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.511
- [man 6] Good job, everybody.
- [man 7] Been a long time.

24:40.513 --> 24:42.613
- [man 5] Excellent.
- [Donna-Mae] Fantastic.

24:42.615 --> 24:46.217
<i>[Raul] It got crated this
morning, came to a new zoo,</i>

24:46.219 --> 24:50.855
all these new smells and sounds
from the public and other animals.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.357
<i>So for now, we need them
to get very comfortable.</i>

24:54.192 --> 24:56.060
All right.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.263
See if we could feed
the two new cubs.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.967
Let's hope they're hungry.
I think he'll eat.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.703
She on the other hand,
she's a lot shier than he is.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.238
They just kind of getting
to know things, you know.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.507
So, this is all new to them.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.244
What are you guys doing?

25:13.845 --> 25:15.746
You're not hungry?

25:15.748 --> 25:18.048
We're looking forward to
be able to build relationships

25:18.050 --> 25:20.684
and develop great bonds
with them

25:20.686 --> 25:22.786
<i>so we can train them
and enrich them.</i>

25:22.788 --> 25:25.489
Come on, buddy, I'm going to
drop another meatball there for you.

25:25.491 --> 25:28.459
You're not hungry? I know you're
hungry. You're always hungry.

25:28.493 --> 25:31.762
You don't get that big by
not being hungry all the time.

25:31.764 --> 25:36.033
<i>The male seems to not care too
much whose around them.</i>

25:36.035 --> 25:38.035
<i>The female, his sister,
is a little more apprehensive</i>

25:38.037 --> 25:40.004
<i>being around new people.</i>

25:40.006 --> 25:42.039
You know you want some meat.

25:42.707 --> 25:45.042
Come on, buddy. That a boy.

25:45.977 --> 25:48.879
You don't care that much
who feed you, you're like me.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.214
As long as I get fed.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.083
That a girl.

25:53.251 --> 25:54.919
That just makes me very happy.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.820
Here you come. That's okay.

25:56.822 --> 25:59.089
It's just Britney. Oh, it's
just Britney, come on, guys.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.292
[Britney] I'm not very scary.

26:01.294 --> 26:03.060
- [Raul] Oh, come on, guys.
- That's a scaredy-cat.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.062
[both chuckle]

26:05.931 --> 26:07.498
[Raul] I see you
licking your chops.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.237
[Britney] Oh, what a good girl.

26:13.905 --> 26:16.807
[Raul] It's like
feeding a toddler.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.910
This is awesome. Just to have the
opportunity to work with new animals

26:19.912 --> 26:22.179
and then have them come over
and eat from you

26:22.181 --> 26:24.048
the first time they're
in their new home.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.783
Oh, it is... It's great.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.184
It's a great feeling.

26:28.486 --> 26:30.854
That's it, buddy.
You ate it all.

26:30.856 --> 26:32.523
I think it's nap time now.

26:33.224 --> 26:35.593
Yeah, that's a good boy.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.294
Plop down.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.829
It's going to take a while
to develop a bond

26:38.831 --> 26:41.498
but obviously it's moving
a lot faster than I thought.

26:45.036 --> 26:47.638
[Sabrina] Here, Babi.
Come and eat breakfast.

26:47.640 --> 26:52.042
Any time we do a medical
procedure afterwards, it's kind of like,

26:52.044 --> 26:56.280
hey, you know, you've betrayed me and
you have to regain that trust with them.

26:57.215 --> 26:58.949
Where did you go?

27:03.955 --> 27:07.057
[woman 9] Look at the monkeys.
They're hugging.

27:12.764 --> 27:15.099
-[Ken Huth] Never a dull moment.
-It's always fun.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.901
[Ken] It is always fun.

27:17.903 --> 27:21.005
You never know what you're
gonna expect when you come to work.

27:26.511 --> 27:29.847
This is a Red-crested
Turaco chick.

27:29.849 --> 27:32.983
Today is the second day in a row

27:32.985 --> 27:35.753
that this bird has decided
to leave the nest,

27:35.755 --> 27:37.354
and fall into the exhibit,

27:37.356 --> 27:40.824
which is not where
we want it to be.

27:40.826 --> 27:44.862
<i>Yesterday we added some perching
and some branching up around the nest,</i>

27:44.864 --> 27:46.430
<i>but we put the chick back
in the nest.</i>

27:46.432 --> 27:50.734
<i>And then, by this afternoon,
the chick had once again</i>

27:50.736 --> 27:54.138
<i>fledged out of the nest and
was falling down below the nest.</i>

27:54.773 --> 27:56.507
So it looks like
it wants to eat.

27:56.509 --> 27:59.677
So he's trying to bite me
so that's good, too.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.612
Can't see any
the injuries though.

28:01.614 --> 28:03.947
<i>This to Turaco chick
is at that fledging stage,</i>

28:03.949 --> 28:07.785
which you could equate to
a toddler running around.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.787
You know, you have to
baby proof your house.

28:09.789 --> 28:12.222
<i>So now we're coming up
with a plan B.</i>

28:15.260 --> 28:17.661
- [man 8] Okay.
- [man 9] We put the nest in?

28:17.663 --> 28:19.430
- Sure.
- First.

28:19.432 --> 28:22.199
- Yeah, that works.
- [Ken] This is the most important part.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.601
[Chuck Cerbini] We're going to
put a small enclosure within

28:24.603 --> 28:25.869
the larger enclosure.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.038
It's an area where we can
contain the chick

28:28.040 --> 28:30.140
but allow the parents
to go in and out

28:30.142 --> 28:32.676
to still take care of it
before it's really

28:32.678 --> 28:35.412
to navigate the exhibit and fly.

28:38.116 --> 28:40.551
<i>[Ken] Even though this
Red-crested Turaco chick</i>

28:40.553 --> 28:42.720
<i>has fledged for a second time,</i>

28:42.722 --> 28:46.323
we still are trying
to keep it with the parents.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.025
<i>It's going to be better
for the parents.</i>

28:48.027 --> 28:50.894
<i>They kind of have to learn
how to raise this chick.</i>

28:50.896 --> 28:53.063
<i>In addition to that, it'll be
better for the chick</i>

28:53.065 --> 28:55.532
because they're less likely
that chick will think that

28:55.534 --> 28:57.901
it's a person that's imprinted,

28:57.903 --> 29:00.938
<i>and that would be better
for the breeding population.</i>

29:00.940 --> 29:04.174
<i>You want to have more parent-raised
birds than hand-raised birds.</i>

29:06.311 --> 29:08.746
- [Chuck] Good.
- [Ken] Good. Okay.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.881
So, I think
all we need is a chick.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.282
All right, I'll be back.

29:12.884 --> 29:15.919
We're working on it, guys,
we're working on it.

29:15.921 --> 29:19.389
It looks like it's hungry. It's
waiting for food from its parents.

29:20.024 --> 29:23.193
<i>[Chuck] This chick is really
important for the zoo.</i>

29:23.195 --> 29:26.029
<i>The goal is to wind up
with young, healthy offspring</i>

29:26.031 --> 29:28.732
<i>that eventually get set up
in a breeding situation</i>

29:28.734 --> 29:30.200
<i>and start having chicks
of its own.</i>

29:30.869 --> 29:32.503
That's a nice papaya. Yeah.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.107
Calling us.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.509
[Ken] Yeah, they've been
watching us.

29:39.377 --> 29:40.711
There you go.

29:40.713 --> 29:43.514
You can have more
if you're still hungry.

29:43.516 --> 29:45.149
[woman 10 speaking]
That's just me.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.985
Yeah, now she has name for it.

29:48.920 --> 29:49.953
[laughs]

29:49.955 --> 29:51.355
I like it.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.358
[Ken] Okay, look, see.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.394
Yeah, you see. Good.

30:08.239 --> 30:10.073
[chirps]

30:13.478 --> 30:16.146
[Leela] Oh, I love it.

30:17.515 --> 30:20.217
<i>[Chuck] Even though the parents
are with him and taking care of it,</i>

30:20.219 --> 30:23.554
<i>we're certainly not out of the
woods with this Turaco chick yet.</i>

30:23.556 --> 30:25.556
<i>It does have some more
developing to do.</i>

30:25.558 --> 30:29.459
<i>Once I see the juvenile
moving around and flying,</i>

30:29.461 --> 30:33.263
navigating the exhibit really well
and finding the food pan on its own

30:33.265 --> 30:36.400
and feeding itself, then I'll
feel really good about the chick.

30:39.037 --> 30:41.271
[indistinct chatter]

30:50.682 --> 30:53.283
[Sabrina] We're in
the Congo kitchen.

30:53.285 --> 30:56.520
Just getting some treats
for Babatunde

30:56.522 --> 30:58.522
and the boys breakfast.

31:02.727 --> 31:04.261
Come here, Babi.

31:07.131 --> 31:09.499
Come on, what's going on?

31:10.001 --> 31:11.401
Come on.

31:14.339 --> 31:17.174
Take that,
come and eat breakfast.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.544
Babi.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.217
Good boy.

31:30.154 --> 31:31.655
Baba.

31:31.657 --> 31:34.258
<i>Any time we do
a medical procedure</i>

31:34.260 --> 31:37.127
<i>or anything that is
a discomfort to them,</i>

31:37.129 --> 31:38.962
<i>we can't explain
why we're doing it.</i>

31:38.997 --> 31:40.998
Here.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.667
Although I am a comfort for him.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.536
It's kind of like, hey,
you know, you betrayed me,

31:46.538 --> 31:49.873
and you have to regain
that trust with them.

31:49.875 --> 31:51.275
Target.

31:53.144 --> 31:57.381
Baba. Here. Okay.

31:59.017 --> 32:00.384
Target.

32:02.020 --> 32:04.054
- [clicks]
- Good. Shoulder.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.422
- There he goes.
- [clicks]

32:06.124 --> 32:07.524
Do you want to do this for me?

32:09.327 --> 32:10.494
- [clicks]
- Open.

32:12.030 --> 32:13.397
Good boy.

32:14.265 --> 32:17.200
Open. Oh, open.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.069
Let's see that tooth-y.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.203
It's looking good.

32:20.205 --> 32:23.173
No signs of irritation

32:23.175 --> 32:25.909
or inflamed gums, or anything.

32:25.911 --> 32:28.912
- Open, good. Tongue.
- [clicks]

32:28.914 --> 32:30.714
<i>Moving forward to help</i>

32:30.716 --> 32:32.983
<i>repair my relationship
with Babatunde.</i>

32:32.985 --> 32:35.786
<i>I'll just spend some
extra time with him,</i>

32:35.788 --> 32:39.256
<i>do training sets
more often with him.</i>

32:39.258 --> 32:41.191
And then it's just
a day to day waiting

32:41.193 --> 32:43.527
how he reacts to me.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.862
Can you get the target for me?

32:45.864 --> 32:49.132
So he's still a little nervous
but this is a good step.

32:50.234 --> 32:51.468
Here, Babi.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.071
Where'd you go?

32:56.507 --> 32:59.810
[Raul] You forget you're in Queens,
when you look into this exhibit.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.378
Go ahead and I'll pull the gate.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.313
There she goes.

33:07.885 --> 33:09.519
[seals barking]

33:15.126 --> 33:19.229
-[Kathleen] All right. You guys ready?
-[woman 11] Yeah.

33:19.231 --> 33:24.001
[Jim] It's just so surreal of this
warthog just trotting down the hall.

33:24.003 --> 33:26.770
You come trotting down.
You came trotting down.

33:26.772 --> 33:29.773
[laughing]

33:29.775 --> 33:32.609
<i>[Kathleen] I asked Jim to come
over today just to get his opinion.</i>

33:32.611 --> 33:35.612
He's new to this
whole operation,

33:35.614 --> 33:38.281
<i>and he has a good gut
instinct with this stuff.</i>

33:38.283 --> 33:41.685
<i>So I'm interested on his take
on the whole training session.</i>

33:41.687 --> 33:43.020
[Caroline] Ready?

33:43.022 --> 33:45.188
- [Jason] Stick it.
- [Caroline] Good boy.

33:46.090 --> 33:47.891
- Good, Peach.
- [Kathleen] That was good.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.059
[Jim] Yeah.
That was really good.

33:49.061 --> 33:51.128
<i>Unlike the people
that work in this building,</i>

33:51.130 --> 33:52.963
<i>I don't get to see
Peaches every day.</i>

33:52.965 --> 33:56.066
I was here when he came in
the first day from Columbus

33:56.068 --> 33:57.801
when he was this
tiny little piglet.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.837
<i>And now he looks like
a big old warthog.</i>

34:00.839 --> 34:04.274
[Kathleen] How confident are
you to do the actual vaccine?

34:04.276 --> 34:05.575
[Caroline] I think we're ready.

34:05.577 --> 34:08.512
- [Jim] I would be pretty confident.
- [Kathleen] Okay, good.

34:08.780 --> 34:12.382
[Jim] I wish my doctor would
stand there, feed me a Snickers bar

34:12.384 --> 34:14.217
when I got my shot.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.752
[Kathleen] You don't need
a Snickers bar.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.154
[Jim laughs]

34:18.790 --> 34:20.524
You can just hear me
heavily breathing

34:20.526 --> 34:22.659
the entire time
leading up to this. [laughs]

34:22.661 --> 34:24.528
<i>I'm nervous for Peaches.</i>

34:24.762 --> 34:28.832
Dr. Chaney's gonna come over
and give him his first of the vaccines.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.034
[Dr. Sarah Chaney] Where would
you like me to stand?

34:31.036 --> 34:33.637
[Caroline] Jason normally stands
right where you're standing right now.

34:33.639 --> 34:37.040
Um, but honestly, whatever
you feel comfortable with.

34:37.042 --> 34:39.276
- [Dr. Chaney] So we're doing rabies today.
- [Caroline] Okay.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.178
-[Dr. Chaney] Ready if you are.
-[Caroline] I'm ready.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.747
Come on, handsome boy.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.515
<i>It's what we've been practicing</i>

34:45.517 --> 34:49.319
and working on for months now,
so I'm super excited.

34:49.321 --> 34:52.189
Definitely a little bit nervous,
but that's kind of to be expected.

34:52.723 --> 34:54.157
Go inside.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.993
- Hi, handsome.
- Good job, good.

34:59.497 --> 35:01.064
I'm ready when you are.

35:01.066 --> 35:03.200
- [Dr. Chaney] Okay.
- [Caroline] Good.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.801
[Dr. Chaney] Sticking.

35:04.803 --> 35:05.902
- [snorts]
- [Caroline] You're okay.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.771
- [Dr. Chaney] Oh.
- [Caroline] Go ahead.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.506
- You let me know when you want to try again.
- Yeah.

35:10.141 --> 35:11.541
All right, I'm ready.

35:12.810 --> 35:15.312
- Poking.
- [grunts]

35:16.814 --> 35:18.915
He did not squeal
like I thought he would.

35:18.917 --> 35:21.485
- But I think most went in him.
- I think, too.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.720
- Good boy, you did it.
- [Dr. Chaney] All righty.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.155
Good job, Peaches.

35:25.157 --> 35:27.257
- Good job, piggy.
- [laughs]

35:27.259 --> 35:30.193
Oh, such a good boy.

35:30.561 --> 35:32.129
<i>I am super excited.</i>

35:32.131 --> 35:35.966
<i>I've been working on Peaches'
vaccination basically since last year.</i>

35:35.968 --> 35:39.136
So to know that it's done
and he did so well

35:39.138 --> 35:40.804
and it wasn't stressful
for him at all.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.006
I am so excited today.

35:43.008 --> 35:45.375
He's just such a good pig.
I'm so proud of him.

35:53.985 --> 35:54.851
Mama gazelle.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.419
[snorts]

36:03.060 --> 36:06.129
[Raul] All right, Right now
we're entering puma holding.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.465
Today's the big day.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.635
We're putting up our new puma cubs
and introduce them to their new exhibit.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.136
<i>It's a big step for the cubs.</i>

36:13.138 --> 36:15.338
<i>This is the first time they're
going to have access</i>

36:15.340 --> 36:17.440
<i>to actual trees and grasses.</i>

36:21.679 --> 36:23.880
<i>Before we ever put
our animals out on exhibit,</i>

36:23.882 --> 36:25.982
<i>first thing we do
is go through the exhibit,</i>

36:25.984 --> 36:27.617
<i>make sure there's no dangers
to the animals,</i>

36:27.619 --> 36:29.019
<i>no, like, escape hazards.</i>

36:29.021 --> 36:32.956
<i>Anything that cause problems
to the integrity of the exhibit.</i>

36:32.958 --> 36:35.091
Sure, they're gonna love
sleeping on there.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.594
[Jim] I think It looks good.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.930
<i>Because the animals
are new to the exhibit,</i>

36:39.932 --> 36:41.631
<i>what we generally do
is put soap on the window</i>

36:41.633 --> 36:45.168
to make it obvious that
there's a boundary there

36:45.170 --> 36:48.238
<i>that doesn't look like something
the animals can run through.</i>

36:50.274 --> 36:52.209
- All set?
- I guess we're all set.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.376
Let's see what happens.

36:53.378 --> 36:56.213
All right, I'll call Britney
and tell her to pull the gate.

36:56.747 --> 36:58.215
And on to...

36:58.217 --> 37:00.083
<i>Right now I am pulling it.</i>

37:02.620 --> 37:04.154
There she goes.

37:07.491 --> 37:09.926
You see, I would have thought he
would have been the first one to come out,

37:09.928 --> 37:11.328
but you never know.

37:14.999 --> 37:16.933
[Jim] Look how
they look great in there.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.535
[Raul] Oh, it's a beautiful
exhibit for them.

37:19.637 --> 37:20.937
Very natural.

37:21.072 --> 37:24.975
You forget you're in Queens
when you look into this exhibit.

37:24.977 --> 37:26.543
Oh, wow, she's very curious.

37:29.113 --> 37:30.747
Look at that.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.282
Oh, that's beautiful.

37:34.585 --> 37:36.519
They seem very,
very comfortable.

37:36.787 --> 37:37.887
<i>Soon as we brought 'em here
to the Queen's zoo...</i>

37:37.889 --> 37:41.358
<i>It just seemed like
this was their home.</i>

37:41.360 --> 37:44.694
Look at them playing around and not
very cautious about their surroundings.

37:44.696 --> 37:47.764
They just kind of enjoying
what they have right now.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.899
That's great,
didn't expect that.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.134
[Donna-Mae] That was amazing.

37:51.136 --> 37:53.637
They couldn't have
gone any better.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.171
Good to see
that exhibit alive again.

37:55.173 --> 37:57.474
[Raul] I know. Yeah, well,
definitely, definitely.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.045
[Jim] Just remarkable.

38:02.713 --> 38:04.381
That's a good sign.
That's really good.

38:16.727 --> 38:18.862
- [Jim] Hey, Chuck. Good.
- How you doing?

38:18.864 --> 38:21.731
- [Jim] You see the chicks?
- Right over here.

38:21.733 --> 38:24.501
- Up front, looking at us.
- [Jim] Look at this little guy.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.536
[Chuck] Yeah,
pretty confident, huh?

38:26.538 --> 38:28.705
<i>[Jim] Last time
I saw this Turaco chick,</i>

38:28.707 --> 38:32.942
<i>he was kind of a dark
colored feathered, mass.</i>

38:32.944 --> 38:35.178
<i>Now he's colored up,
he's way more active.</i>

38:35.180 --> 38:37.147
<i>He's bouncing around the exhibit</i>

38:37.149 --> 38:39.749
<i>in typical Turaco fashion.</i>

38:39.751 --> 38:40.817
It's just remarkable.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.819
So he's eating on his
own right there.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.354
I mean, they may feed him but...

38:44.356 --> 38:46.256
[Chuck] That's a good sign,
that's really good.

38:46.258 --> 38:49.526
[Jim] Last time I came over,
he was on that howdy cage

38:49.528 --> 38:51.027
hunkered down.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.529
You took that out now.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.898
[Chuck] Yeah, right now this
chick is between

38:54.900 --> 38:56.933
seven and eight weeks old,
which is around the time

38:56.935 --> 39:00.236
that they'll start weaning
and becoming independent.

39:00.238 --> 39:02.839
<i>After a couple of months,
we observed that the bird was</i>

39:02.841 --> 39:04.941
<i>very comfortable in the exhibit.</i>

39:04.943 --> 39:07.077
It was navigating the
perching very well,

39:07.079 --> 39:10.080
it was starting eating on its
own and it was starting to fly, too.

39:10.082 --> 39:11.781
<i>So at that point,
we chose to remove</i>

39:11.783 --> 39:13.283
<i>the howdy from the exhibit</i>

39:13.285 --> 39:17.721
<i>because we're really comfortable
with how the bird was adapting.</i>

39:17.723 --> 39:21.257
[Jim] It's really nice that you got
them to raise the chick in this exhibit.

39:21.259 --> 39:23.360
We have two great parents,
and it's a great sign

39:23.362 --> 39:25.528
this is their first chick
they've ever raised.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.831
'Cause once they're successful,
you know, they'll keep doing it.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.967
So we should keep having
success with the parents.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.704
[Jim] After almost three decades
of now breeding Red-crested Turaco

39:34.706 --> 39:36.740
for us to have
this kind of success,

39:36.742 --> 39:39.042
there's so much
to celebrate here.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.378
[Chuck] Yeah, we're pretty
pleased about it.

39:48.953 --> 39:50.954
[kid 3] That's a huge gorilla.

39:53.858 --> 39:56.059
[indistinct chatter]

39:57.495 --> 39:59.162
[Sabrina] So I just locked
Babatunde from the yard.

39:59.164 --> 40:02.165
- So that he just go out there and never come in.
- Right?

40:05.136 --> 40:06.302
What do you think?

40:06.670 --> 40:08.238
Triska.

40:09.039 --> 40:11.508
Today we're doing
an ultrasound training set

40:11.510 --> 40:13.977
with Babatunde
and Dr. Bartlett.

40:14.311 --> 40:16.179
Hi, Tundi.

40:16.181 --> 40:19.916
Come on, come here,
what a good boy.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.718
[Dr. Bartlett] Hi, bud.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.787
I've made a lot of progress
with rebuilding

40:23.789 --> 40:25.755
the relationship with Babatunde.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.525
<i>So I'm hoping that will
lead to less hesitation</i>

40:28.527 --> 40:31.027
with his participation
in his training sets.

40:31.896 --> 40:34.063
All right, I'm gonna try
to put some lube on them.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.432
Oh, come on.

40:37.067 --> 40:39.035
He's just gonna eat it.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.370
So maybe the probe's there.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.975
I know, hold, good.

40:45.977 --> 40:47.977
[Dr. Bartlett]
Think we just should focus on

40:47.979 --> 40:50.647
his behavior and not the image.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.482
-[Sabrina] Okay? Just holding it.
-Yeah.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.385
[Sabrina] Good boy,
that was great.

40:55.886 --> 40:57.220
Hold.

40:58.022 --> 41:00.190
- Good job.
- [Dr. Bartlett] Nice.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.060
He's making progress.

41:04.062 --> 41:06.496
- [Sabrina] Yeah.
- Like before our very eyes.

41:06.498 --> 41:08.264
[both laugh]

41:08.266 --> 41:10.867
[Sabrina] That's a good thing
once they understand.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.002
- Yeah.
- You do one more.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.604
Good job.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.005
We'll leave it at that.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.074
- We can work with this.
- [Dr. Bartlett] Yeah.

41:19.009 --> 41:21.978
[Sabrina] Here you go from
me and Dr. Suzie.

41:22.780 --> 41:24.848
Good boy.

41:24.850 --> 41:27.784
<i>Working with gorillas
was just a really fun</i>

41:27.786 --> 41:28.952
<i>and amazing experience.</i>

41:28.954 --> 41:32.021
Okay, you can go back outside.

41:32.023 --> 41:34.424
<i>They're all so individual,
then you form</i>

41:34.426 --> 41:36.926
<i>different relationships
with each gorilla.</i>

41:36.928 --> 41:38.962
Hi!

41:38.964 --> 41:40.296
They're just amazing animals.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.465
What a gorilla.
