00:07.931 --> 00:09.413
- You run Black Rock Boys?

00:09.413 --> 00:11.586
- I love the dangerous shit.
You know that.

00:11.586 --> 00:14.448
Previously, on
"All The Queen's Men"--

00:14.448 --> 00:17.344
- Please put me down!
I wanna make a deal with you.

00:17.344 --> 00:19.275
Give her to me.
- Who is "her"?

00:19.275 --> 00:21.172
- I wanted to talk to you about

00:21.172 --> 00:23.172
booking some of your guys
this weekend.

00:23.172 --> 00:24.965
- So how many do you want?

00:24.965 --> 00:26.965
- Every single one
I've seen dancing here.

00:26.965 --> 00:28.586
- You do know we have
to find her, right?

00:28.586 --> 00:29.931
- Yeah.

00:29.931 --> 00:31.137
- I don't like an
unstable bitch out there

00:31.137 --> 00:32.551
unless I have my eyes on her.

00:55.241 --> 00:57.896
- Miss Patrice Ellis?

00:57.896 --> 01:00.206
- What the hell
are you doing here?

01:00.206 --> 01:03.482
- Your son had some of his
friends assault my nephew, Amp.

01:05.586 --> 01:08.344
- I am not in
the mood for this.

01:08.344 --> 01:10.137
- We're gonna have this
conversation here and now,

01:10.137 --> 01:11.793
or we're gonna have it
at Terry's funeral.

01:15.793 --> 01:17.034
- And you are?

01:17.034 --> 01:19.344
- Blue, Madam's
head of security.

01:22.448 --> 01:23.896
- The Madam?

01:23.896 --> 01:26.034
Cadillac's daughter?

01:26.034 --> 01:27.620
- Yes.

01:27.620 --> 01:30.103
Now, Miss Ellis, I'm gonna
make this very quick.

01:30.103 --> 01:33.379
I can only imagine what you and
your family have gone through

01:33.379 --> 01:36.034
with the death of your daughter.

01:36.034 --> 01:39.310
My nephew, Amp, is very sorry.

01:39.310 --> 01:40.965
Now, I'm not here to ask you
to forgive him,

01:40.965 --> 01:42.620
because that's between
you and God.

01:43.931 --> 01:48.206
But he made a terrible mistake,
and he has paid for his mistake.

01:48.206 --> 01:50.034
He did his time.

01:50.034 --> 01:53.275
Now he is out, and he is trying
to get his life back together.

01:59.137 --> 02:04.758
Am I supposed to...feel bad?

02:04.758 --> 02:08.827
'Cause he got a couple
of lumps and bruises?

02:08.827 --> 02:11.620
I don't.

02:11.620 --> 02:16.000
My daughter's bed is still
empty,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.137
like it's been
for the last nine years.

02:18.137 --> 02:20.758
She ain't never coming back.

02:22.862 --> 02:28.793
So excuse me if I don't
shed a tear for your nephew.

02:28.793 --> 02:31.689
- I would hate for you to have
to bury your son

02:31.689 --> 02:34.310
next to your daughter.

02:34.310 --> 02:37.034
Talk to your son.

02:37.034 --> 02:38.793
Only warning.

03:06.655 --> 03:09.241
- You okay, Ma?

03:09.241 --> 03:11.586
Don't worry, I'll
take care of them.

03:11.586 --> 03:14.206
- You need to drop this, Terry.

03:14.206 --> 03:15.793
- What?
- Drop it.

03:17.206 --> 03:20.517
That woman is Satan's sister.

03:22.655 --> 03:24.965
I knew her father
back in the day.

03:24.965 --> 03:28.206
He was a hustler
and a killer too.

03:28.206 --> 03:31.344
And she is worse than he was.

03:31.344 --> 03:35.931
She will kill you with
a smile on her face.

03:35.931 --> 03:37.965
So you need to let this go.

04:23.068 --> 04:25.172
-He's still in there.

04:25.172 --> 04:27.000
-He won't be long.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.896
-How can you tell?

04:29.896 --> 04:33.068
- I'm the one that
started this poker game.

04:33.068 --> 04:35.275
Still cool with the dealer.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.379
Said Roman's on his last couple
of chips, and when he's done,

04:39.379 --> 04:41.137
then he'll send him out.

04:41.137 --> 04:42.793
And we'll wait.

05:02.827 --> 05:04.896
-Don't.
- Okay, okay.

05:04.896 --> 05:08.206
- I don't like having
to repeat myself, Roman.

05:08.206 --> 05:11.689
So what am I about to say?

05:11.689 --> 05:13.931
-That I better get
you your motherfucking money.

05:13.931 --> 05:16.724
And this is the last warning
I'm gonna get from you.

05:19.862 --> 05:22.034
- Good talk.

05:22.034 --> 05:26.034
-Uh, fuck!

05:39.655 --> 05:41.827
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:47.241 --> 05:50.137
- Um, thank you for stopping by
the bank so I could open up

05:50.137 --> 05:51.655
that savings account.

05:51.655 --> 05:54.931
You should have seen the
tellers' faces when I pulled out

05:54.931 --> 05:56.517
all them damn ones.

05:56.517 --> 06:01.931
- So you gonna tell me what
last night was all about?

06:01.931 --> 06:03.103
- Mm.

06:03.103 --> 06:04.862
Uh...

06:04.862 --> 06:07.482
I do owe you an
explanation, huh?

06:07.482 --> 06:11.034
- I would say so.

06:11.034 --> 06:16.655
- The guys who jumped me were
sent by a dude named Terry.

06:16.655 --> 06:19.551
I used to date his sister,
Shannon, back in college.

06:21.310 --> 06:22.931
I was about 19.

06:22.931 --> 06:25.517
One night, we was
coming from a party.

06:25.517 --> 06:29.000
And I had been...

06:29.000 --> 06:30.724
I was fucked up.

06:30.724 --> 06:34.655
I knew I shouldn't have been
driving, but I drove anyway.

06:34.655 --> 06:38.482
I thought I was in my lane...

06:38.482 --> 06:40.517
until I heard her scream.

06:42.172 --> 06:44.413
I lost control.

06:44.413 --> 06:47.310
The car spun out.

06:47.310 --> 06:49.793
Flipped a couple times and, um,

06:49.793 --> 06:52.344
Shannon was thrown
from the vehicle.

06:52.344 --> 06:55.482
She, uh...

06:55.482 --> 06:59.103
died later that night
at the hospital.

07:01.586 --> 07:03.034
Head trauma.

07:03.034 --> 07:04.655
- Shit.

07:06.206 --> 07:09.034
- Yeah.

07:09.034 --> 07:09.931
Um...

07:11.482 --> 07:17.137
Drunk driving
and vehicular homicide.

07:17.137 --> 07:22.379
Sentence was 9 to 15 years.

07:22.379 --> 07:25.655
I did nine.

07:25.655 --> 07:28.758
Anyway, I'll finish out
the rest at the house.

07:28.758 --> 07:30.896
- So that's why
you don't drink?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.310
- Yeah.

07:36.310 --> 07:38.758
Yo, if I was her brother,
I'd wanna kill me too, right?

07:43.620 --> 07:48.586
- I saw something on
social media that said...

07:48.586 --> 07:52.103
we all have a chapter in our
lives

07:52.103 --> 07:54.862
that we don't read out loud.

07:54.862 --> 07:56.000
It's true.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.310
-Yeah.

07:58.310 --> 08:03.379
- A few years before Madam
hired me at the nightclub,

08:03.379 --> 08:05.758
I was dancing too.

08:05.758 --> 08:09.103
- Wait, so you was a stripper?

08:09.103 --> 08:13.448
- An exotic dancer, as
you so eloquently put it.

08:17.689 --> 08:21.000
- One day, I...

08:23.586 --> 08:28.689
went to a regular's
house to dance.

08:28.689 --> 08:32.310
He was a super nice guy, so I--

08:32.310 --> 08:35.862
I didn't think I'd be in danger
of going by myself.

08:37.241 --> 08:40.862
So, I'm dancing.

08:40.862 --> 08:43.068
And all of the sudden, he...

08:47.620 --> 08:51.517
He gets all handsy...

08:51.517 --> 08:54.206
and real aggressive.

08:54.206 --> 08:57.172
I asked him to stop.

08:57.172 --> 08:58.620
And he wouldn't.

09:03.206 --> 09:07.344
He started kissing me,
forcing himself on me.

09:11.275 --> 09:12.827
And...

09:16.310 --> 09:19.172
I almost got raped.

09:19.172 --> 09:23.275
Uh, I could barely
keep the guy off me.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.827
That was it.

09:27.827 --> 09:29.793
It wasn't worth it.

09:33.068 --> 09:35.068
I quit.

09:35.068 --> 09:37.620
I started looking
for another job.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.275
And I applied everywhere,

09:39.275 --> 09:43.965
but Madam...

09:43.965 --> 09:47.896
was the only one
that gave me a chance.

09:47.896 --> 09:50.517
- I'm really sorry that
happened to you,

09:50.517 --> 09:52.758
that you had to go through that.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.413
Your story's safe with me.

09:54.413 --> 09:58.310
- Yeah, I know.

09:58.310 --> 10:01.517
Likewise.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.068
- Yeah.

10:10.034 --> 10:11.379
- What the fuck?

10:11.379 --> 10:12.344
- Motherfucking dyke.
- Yo!

10:12.344 --> 10:13.379
- So you wanna be a dude?

10:13.379 --> 10:14.862
- Don't fucking touch me!

10:16.172 --> 10:19.103
- Yo, what you think
this shit about?

10:19.103 --> 10:20.655
- Hell if I know.

10:23.551 --> 10:25.068
- Think we should go help her?

10:25.068 --> 10:27.931
- I'm already there, bro.

10:38.620 --> 10:41.551
- Get the fuck out of here.

10:41.551 --> 10:43.896
- I don't need your help.

10:43.896 --> 10:45.586
- So I guess we should have let
'em just keep

10:45.586 --> 10:47.517
kicking your ass, huh?
- Fuck you.

10:47.517 --> 10:49.172
- Oh, you into that, huh?
- You know what?

10:49.172 --> 10:50.310
- Hey, hey, hey.

10:50.310 --> 10:51.517
What was that all about?

10:51.517 --> 10:52.793
- Nothing.

10:52.793 --> 10:54.275
- We stick together
around here.

10:54.275 --> 10:56.413
And Madam seems to like you.

10:56.413 --> 10:59.034
So, uh, you may end
up dancing here.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.724
You can say thank
you at any time.

11:00.724 --> 11:02.620
- What the fuck I
gotta thank you for?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.310
- Mm, matter of fact,
what's their number?

11:04.310 --> 11:06.275
Maybe we should call 'em back
and let them fuck you up.

11:06.275 --> 11:09.000
- Right.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.068
- Man, she pipping.
- I'm sorry.

11:11.068 --> 11:14.689
Look, I'm not used to having
people do shit for me.

11:14.689 --> 11:16.793
I'm used to doing
it for myself, so--

11:16.793 --> 11:18.482
- Well, not here.

11:18.482 --> 11:19.862
We're family.

11:21.758 --> 11:23.931
- Yeah, you was holding
your own, though.

11:23.931 --> 11:25.586
- I know, right?

11:25.586 --> 11:27.275
Some big motherfucker.

11:27.275 --> 11:28.931
- Nah, I'm kidding,
they was fucking you up.

11:28.931 --> 11:31.793
- Whooping that ass.

11:31.793 --> 11:34.172
- Oh, come on.
- Beat the shit out of her.

11:34.172 --> 11:35.827
- What's this?
What's going on here?

11:35.827 --> 11:37.965
- Somebody don't
fucking listen.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.620
- Yo, you was in
there watching?

11:39.620 --> 11:41.793
- I don't fucking get in that
shit, I fucking warned you.

11:41.793 --> 11:43.275
- Damn, it's like that?

11:43.275 --> 11:44.827
- Yeah.

11:44.827 --> 11:46.965
- Do I wanna know?

11:46.965 --> 11:48.310
- No.

11:48.310 --> 11:51.379
- Alright.

11:51.379 --> 11:52.655
- Come on.

12:04.689 --> 12:06.689
- Y'all know I don't
play this late shit.

12:06.689 --> 12:09.655
To be early is to be on time,
to be on time is to be late.

12:09.655 --> 12:12.206
And to be late is unacceptable.

12:12.206 --> 12:13.620
- Sorry.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.551
- That's cute, but
it's a $100 fine payable

12:18.551 --> 12:20.379
before you leave here today.

12:20.379 --> 12:23.965
Anyway, with our social media
taking off,

12:23.965 --> 12:25.965
we've got a lot
of new customers.

12:25.965 --> 12:28.275
Which means a lot more
money for everyone.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.310
This is Trouble.

12:38.310 --> 12:40.586
- I thought we
was here to please women.

12:40.586 --> 12:42.413
- Hey!

12:42.413 --> 12:45.000
If you have a problem
with it, you can leave.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.551
I am the only one here
that is irreplaceable.

12:48.551 --> 12:50.586
There is way too much
motherfucking money to be made

12:50.586 --> 12:54.137
around here, if you all be
worried about a new dancer.

12:54.137 --> 12:57.620
Step your game up,
perfect your performances.

12:57.620 --> 12:59.068
Your money will keep coming.

13:00.517 --> 13:03.655
Any questions?

13:03.655 --> 13:05.068
- Where she gonna
get dressed at?

13:05.068 --> 13:07.137
- I've seen dick before.

13:07.137 --> 13:08.379
- You might just have one.

13:10.379 --> 13:12.586
- Don't make me get fired on my
first day for smacking you

13:12.586 --> 13:14.551
in the mouth, pretty boy.
- Ooh!

13:14.551 --> 13:16.413
- Oh shit!
- Oh whee!

13:16.413 --> 13:19.793
- Alright, fellas, the van will
be here shortly to pick you up

13:19.793 --> 13:21.689
for the private party.

13:21.689 --> 13:23.206
You already know what to do.

13:24.344 --> 13:27.689
And, amateurs, it's on
y'all tonight, okay?

13:27.689 --> 13:30.482
So keep my money up.

13:30.482 --> 13:31.793
- We got you.

13:31.793 --> 13:33.310
- Thank you.

13:33.310 --> 13:35.551
- Alright, let's
have a good night.

13:39.034 --> 13:41.034
Not you, Amp, come here.

13:45.931 --> 13:47.103
- Yeah?
- You good?

13:48.724 --> 13:50.655
- Yeah.
- You're sure?

13:50.655 --> 13:52.827
- Yes.

13:52.827 --> 13:54.137
-Look--
- Yeah, I'm good.

13:54.137 --> 13:57.517
- That's not gonna
happen again, okay?

13:57.517 --> 14:00.241
- Okay.
- Alright.

14:00.241 --> 14:02.758
You nervous?

14:02.758 --> 14:04.551
- Uh, about this party?

14:04.551 --> 14:06.000
-Yeah.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.344
- It's my first one.

14:08.344 --> 14:10.206
- You'll be fine.

14:10.206 --> 14:12.206
Now catch the guys.
- Okay.

14:12.206 --> 14:13.379
- Alright.

14:13.379 --> 14:15.241
- See ya later.
- See ya later.

14:30.206 --> 14:31.586
- So...

14:34.655 --> 14:36.620
- This is very nice, Tandy.

14:36.620 --> 14:39.931
- Oh, Madam,

14:39.931 --> 14:42.758
don't act like you ain't
impressed by this shit.

14:42.758 --> 14:45.310
- Excuse me?

14:45.310 --> 14:47.413
This pool.

14:47.413 --> 14:48.965
My home.

14:52.034 --> 14:54.551
- I've seen better.

14:54.551 --> 14:55.931
You know what, Tandy, um,

14:55.931 --> 14:57.310
you're well connected.
- I am.

14:57.310 --> 14:58.758
- I wouldn't even deny that,
right?

14:58.758 --> 15:00.931
- Mm-hmm.
- But humble?

15:00.931 --> 15:03.103
Humble might be the route
for you to go right now.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.862
- Oh, humble?
- Mm-hmm.

15:06.862 --> 15:10.379
- Oh, darling, I've worked
way too hard

15:10.379 --> 15:12.965
to be humble.

15:12.965 --> 15:15.482
- Okay. Indeed you have.
- Yeah.

15:15.482 --> 15:19.965
- But you--you could
use some laying low time.

15:19.965 --> 15:21.000
- Pardon me?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.206
- Your name.

15:23.206 --> 15:29.068
Your name's been coming up
in...all the wrong circles.

15:29.068 --> 15:30.827
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:30.827 --> 15:32.724
- Mm.
- Yeah.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.137
So as you said, you
know, I'm very well connected.

15:35.137 --> 15:36.965
- Very. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

15:36.965 --> 15:39.275
And I just think that you
should

15:39.275 --> 15:42.344
just be a little bit careful.

15:42.344 --> 15:45.724
Because I don't wanna be without
your men...

15:45.724 --> 15:48.206
helping me
in such a trying time.

15:48.206 --> 15:49.862
- Well, Ms. Tandy, would you
like to take a seat

15:49.862 --> 15:53.068
in your own home? Shall we?

15:53.068 --> 15:54.724
- We shall.
- Thank you.

16:00.413 --> 16:03.379
- Well, Ms. Tandy, you can
rest assured,

16:03.379 --> 16:06.413
because nothing is gonna happen
to me...

16:06.413 --> 16:08.517
or my men.

16:08.517 --> 16:10.034
- You sure about that?

16:10.034 --> 16:11.724
- All positive.
- Mm-hmm.

16:11.724 --> 16:13.448
- Mm-hmm.

16:13.448 --> 16:16.241
Now you on the other hand,
um,

16:16.241 --> 16:18.551
I can't say the same about you.

16:18.551 --> 16:20.241
- Meaning?

16:20.241 --> 16:24.551
- Meaning that you too have
been coming up in circles.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.724
- Oh, darling.

16:27.724 --> 16:32.689
But the circles I'm talking
about actually have power.

16:32.689 --> 16:33.862
- Oh.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.517
- Yeah.

16:35.517 --> 16:39.310
- So, are we to assume that the
ones I'm talking about...

16:39.310 --> 16:41.827
don't?

16:41.827 --> 16:43.655
- No offense.

16:43.655 --> 16:46.379
- None taken.

16:46.379 --> 16:50.620
Oh honey,
you're like a blog.

16:50.620 --> 16:53.000
I'm a press conference.
- Oh, okay.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.379
- There's a different.

16:54.379 --> 16:55.965
- Oh, there's absolutely
a difference, yes.

16:55.965 --> 16:57.137
- Yeah, yeah.

16:57.137 --> 16:58.551
So what do you make?

16:58.551 --> 17:02.689
Five, ten thousand in
profit----

17:02.689 --> 17:05.620
from your guys a month,
at the most?

17:05.620 --> 17:06.965
- Yeah, that's about it.

17:06.965 --> 17:08.517
Sounds like, yeah.
- Oh.

17:08.517 --> 17:10.103
So again,

17:10.103 --> 17:11.724
the conversations
you're having

17:11.724 --> 17:13.793
are like whispers.
- Ooh.

17:13.793 --> 17:16.551
- Mine are like shouts.

17:16.551 --> 17:19.241
Yeah.
- Understood.

17:19.241 --> 17:20.862
- Yeah, definitely.

17:20.862 --> 17:25.724
So, what time can we
expect your men to be here?

17:25.724 --> 17:29.862
- Well, let's see, they should
actually--

17:29.862 --> 17:30.931
they should be arriving soon.

17:30.931 --> 17:33.275
- Awesome, great.

17:33.275 --> 17:36.931
Well, if you'll excuse me, I
have to make sure that my guests

17:36.931 --> 17:38.758
are okay and they're
arriving properly.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.379
Is that okay?

17:52.724 --> 17:54.724
- Now you sure you don't
wanna give that bitch up?

17:54.724 --> 17:56.931
- Oh no.

17:56.931 --> 17:59.758
Look at her, she's cute...

17:59.758 --> 18:04.034
in a rabbit getting fucked by a
lion kind of a way.

18:05.620 --> 18:06.965
- She ain't got
no fucking clue.

18:06.965 --> 18:08.931
- None at all.

18:08.931 --> 18:10.482
Where are the guys?
- In the van.

18:10.482 --> 18:12.448
- Alright. You staying?

18:12.448 --> 18:14.965
- Mm, I'll be out front.
- Okay.

18:14.965 --> 18:17.172
- Madam.

18:17.172 --> 18:19.482
- You ready?
- Yeah.

18:19.482 --> 18:20.862
- Alright.

18:20.862 --> 18:22.931
So tell me, Dime.

18:22.931 --> 18:27.137
- How exactly you gonna
handle this shit tonight, huh?

18:27.137 --> 18:30.413
- What do you mean?

18:30.413 --> 18:32.206
- So we still gonna act like
you don't like my nephew?

18:32.206 --> 18:35.896
- No, I do.

18:35.896 --> 18:37.448
- I know you do.
- Mm-hmm.

18:37.448 --> 18:41.724
- So like I said, how you
gonna handle this tonight?

18:41.724 --> 18:43.448
- We're not together.

18:43.448 --> 18:46.206
He needs to do his own
thing, I'm gonna do mine.

18:46.206 --> 18:48.137
- Okay.

18:48.137 --> 18:50.172
I see.

18:50.172 --> 18:54.034
- And...he told me.

18:54.034 --> 18:56.586
- What?
About him going to jail?

18:56.586 --> 18:58.448
- Yeah.

18:58.448 --> 19:00.655
- And?

19:00.655 --> 19:04.206
- I mean, we have
all made mistakes.

19:04.206 --> 19:05.517
- Yes, we have.

19:05.517 --> 19:08.241
I know your mistakes.

19:08.241 --> 19:10.172
- So I'm fine with it.

19:10.172 --> 19:12.517
- Good.

19:12.517 --> 19:15.034
Dime, he's a good guy, okay?

19:15.034 --> 19:16.758
- Yeah.
- Alright.

19:16.758 --> 19:21.689
- I can sense it, but those
guys coming after him, and--

19:21.689 --> 19:27.172
- Look, I promise you that
will never happen again, okay?

19:27.172 --> 19:29.034
- I knew you'd take care of it.

19:29.034 --> 19:31.000
- You already know.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.172
- Thank you.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.137
- Thank you for
letting me know.

19:35.137 --> 19:37.551
- No worries.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.310
- Alright.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.310
Are you gonna hold
this shit down tonight?

19:41.310 --> 19:43.068
- Yeah, I got you.

19:43.068 --> 19:44.413
- Good.

19:44.413 --> 19:45.655
I'm gonna go check
on the fellas.

19:45.655 --> 19:47.275
- Okay.
- Bye.

19:53.655 --> 19:55.724
Alright, fellas,
you all know the drill.

19:55.724 --> 19:58.068
Ms. Tandy's wealthiest friends
are here tonight

19:58.068 --> 20:00.758
for this divorce party,
so have fun.

20:00.758 --> 20:02.172
Be safe.

20:02.172 --> 20:04.551
And hopefully, you
motherfuckers can swim.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.206
- I know, right.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.379
- Now the newly divorced
lady's name is Dawn.

20:08.379 --> 20:10.827
She'll be the one
wearing a tiara.

20:10.827 --> 20:13.206
Make sure you spoil her.

20:13.206 --> 20:14.896
- What's a tiara?

20:14.896 --> 20:17.068
- It's one of those things
women wear in beauty pageants.

20:17.068 --> 20:18.965
- Queens wear them.

20:18.965 --> 20:21.689
They're shiny with jewelry on
them, like a skinny crown.

20:23.724 --> 20:26.034
- You really don't
know what a tiara is?

20:26.034 --> 20:28.551
- I've never been to a
motherfucking beauty pageant.

20:28.551 --> 20:31.206
- Make sure you guys have
condoms

20:31.206 --> 20:35.275
for those of you going the extra
mile tonight.

20:38.034 --> 20:39.379
- You're not staying?

20:39.379 --> 20:40.965
- Uh, no, look.

20:40.965 --> 20:45.448
If you need anything, tell
Dime, and she'll hit me.

20:45.448 --> 20:46.344
Okay?

20:46.344 --> 20:47.827
Have fun, fellas!

20:52.448 --> 20:54.689
- You have no much idea how
much I thank you for this.

20:54.689 --> 20:59.206
- No, I--I really do, because
that asshole you married, yeah,

20:59.206 --> 21:02.689
you--you deserve so much
more than that, okay?

21:02.689 --> 21:04.655
- I'm just scared, I mean--
- No, I understand.

21:04.655 --> 21:06.862
I understand, but tonight
we are celebrating.

21:06.862 --> 21:09.137
Okay, so stop
all--this is all for you.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.310
- Yes.
- This is all for you.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.413
- Yes.
- Okay?

21:11.413 --> 21:12.896
Alright, alright.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.758
Let me get you--can we
get some more champagne?

21:14.758 --> 21:17.034
- No, honestly, I've
had enough already.

21:17.034 --> 21:18.448
I need to stop.
- You sure?

21:18.448 --> 21:19.931
- Yes.
- Okay, we're gonna elevate

21:19.931 --> 21:24.103
this thing, and you are going to
hit this right now.

21:24.103 --> 21:25.931
- Okay.
- Come on.

21:25.931 --> 21:27.310
- Um...

21:27.310 --> 21:28.758
- Pull it.

21:28.758 --> 21:31.862
Pull...it.

21:31.862 --> 21:36.000
There, yes, yes.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.655
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:37.655 --> 21:40.206
So now I--I don't need none of
that sadness tonight, okay?

21:40.206 --> 21:41.586
- Okay, fine. Fine.
- Alright, alright,

21:41.586 --> 21:44.344
so enjoy yourself.
You can continue to do that.

21:55.241 --> 21:57.344
- Yes!

23:28.896 --> 23:31.103
- MS.Dime?

23:31.103 --> 23:33.137
Dime, come smack it one time!

23:34.413 --> 23:35.413
-I'm good, Ms. Tandy.

23:35.413 --> 23:36.793
- MS.It's so fine.

23:36.793 --> 23:38.206
-It looks like
you got everything.

23:38.206 --> 23:41.655
- No--Look, you
just--come on, just--just give

23:41.655 --> 23:43.551
it a chance, just
like a little pop.

23:43.551 --> 23:46.034
And, see, let me show you how to
do--it's--it's a twist

23:46.034 --> 23:49.586
and an up.
Twist, it's like a--ah, ah!

23:49.586 --> 23:51.275
Like that, go ahead, go ahead.

23:51.275 --> 23:52.586
Yes, treat yourself.

23:52.586 --> 23:54.137
Go treat yourself, baby.

23:54.137 --> 23:56.068
Ahh, yes, that was good.

23:56.068 --> 23:59.206
The--you did it, that whoo.
That was good.

23:59.206 --> 24:04.172
- Yes, yes, mm-hmm.

24:04.172 --> 24:05.413
Oooh!

24:06.965 --> 24:08.206
- Sandwich.

24:08.206 --> 24:10.379
Yes, God, excuse me.

24:49.379 --> 24:51.206
- Hey.

24:51.206 --> 24:55.241
- First party.
- Yeah.

24:55.241 --> 24:57.310
- What do you think?

24:57.310 --> 25:00.689
- Uh...ready to
get out of here.

25:00.689 --> 25:02.206
- What's the problem?

25:02.206 --> 25:06.413
- Yeah, I'm just ready to
get out of here with you.

25:06.413 --> 25:09.620
- So these women
around here

25:09.620 --> 25:10.931
have you made you horny?

25:10.931 --> 25:12.517
- No, these women
ain't make me horny.

25:12.517 --> 25:15.862
But you make me that
way all the time.

25:15.862 --> 25:18.517
- Okay, well, you're working.

25:18.517 --> 25:22.344
- Yeah, but can't we just go
somewhere after

25:22.344 --> 25:25.344
we get out of here, please?

25:25.344 --> 25:28.413
- This could go on for a while.

25:28.413 --> 25:30.862
- Oh man, Dime, get it.

25:32.758 --> 25:34.620
Shit has been weird.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.172
- What you mean?

25:36.172 --> 25:38.482
- Like over there.

25:38.482 --> 25:41.103
You don't see all the drugs?

25:41.103 --> 25:44.379
- I do my gig.

25:44.379 --> 25:47.655
- Hey, yo, motherfuckers
starting to hook up and shit.

25:47.655 --> 25:48.793
We're cool.

25:48.793 --> 25:53.379
- Yeah, well, that's...

25:53.379 --> 25:54.965
- What?
- It is what it is.

25:54.965 --> 25:56.379
- What? You don't seem
surprised?

25:56.379 --> 25:58.000
- Not at all,
I told you,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.724
that's the kind of thing that
goes down at this.

26:00.724 --> 26:03.379
- Yeah, well...

26:03.379 --> 26:05.310
that's not my thing.
I'm gonna tap out, alright?

26:06.551 --> 26:08.103
- Okay, I see.

26:08.103 --> 26:10.103
- Yeah. You see?

26:12.827 --> 26:14.896
Alright, I guess I'm gonna
get a cab home, okay?

26:17.034 --> 26:20.172
- Well, if you wait,
I can drive you.

26:24.413 --> 26:25.931
- No way--

26:25.931 --> 26:29.275
- Just wait for me,
you're being annoying.

26:29.275 --> 26:33.379
- Alright, alright, well,
I will wait on the curb.

26:33.379 --> 26:35.344
I'm gonna go get dressed, okay?

26:35.344 --> 26:37.827
- Sit in my car.

26:37.827 --> 26:39.241
- Sit in your car?

26:39.241 --> 26:40.655
Girl, I've been to prison.

26:40.655 --> 26:42.517
I can sit on the curb.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.862
What you trying to say?

26:43.862 --> 26:47.482
- Fine, suit yourself.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.827
- Alright, well, fine.

26:49.827 --> 26:52.172
Don't take too long.

26:52.172 --> 26:54.206
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:00.413 --> 27:02.827
- You know what you need?
- What?

27:02.827 --> 27:04.137
- To get fucked.

27:04.137 --> 27:07.620
- You ain't lying.
- Yeah.

27:07.620 --> 27:10.275
So which one of
them do you want?

27:10.275 --> 27:11.827
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

27:11.827 --> 27:15.103
- This is hard.
- I know, very hard.

27:15.103 --> 27:17.655
- Uh, ooh.

27:17.655 --> 27:18.758
I want that one right there.

27:18.758 --> 27:20.448
- Okay, okay.

27:20.448 --> 27:22.482
Midnight!
-Right now?

27:22.482 --> 27:24.413
- Yes, right now, right now.

27:24.413 --> 27:25.827
Hey.
- Hey, baby.

27:25.827 --> 27:27.482
- Hey, good, good, good, good.

27:27.482 --> 27:30.724
So, um, Madam said that if we
wanted to have a little bit more

27:30.724 --> 27:34.000
fun, that we could, uh,
make a deal with you.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.344
- Yeah, I'm all for that.

27:36.482 --> 27:38.827
So how much will it cost?

27:38.827 --> 27:42.413
- You tell me.

27:42.413 --> 27:44.241
- Oh, really?

27:44.241 --> 27:45.586
I gotta do that?

27:45.586 --> 27:47.482
I don't understand.

27:47.482 --> 27:49.379
- What do you think I'm worth?

27:49.379 --> 27:51.655
- Oh God, so he's asking
me to be the judge of that.

27:51.655 --> 27:54.275
Alright,
is there a floor?

27:54.275 --> 27:56.172
- Five hundred is the floor.
- Okay.

27:56.172 --> 27:59.275
But I think we're
gonna need a little more.

27:59.275 --> 28:01.275
- Okay.

28:01.275 --> 28:02.551
- Yeah.

28:02.551 --> 28:04.275
- Well, what do
you have in mind?

28:04.275 --> 28:08.931
- I mean, I think we need more
because it's gonna take at least

28:08.931 --> 28:11.206
two or three people
to tame both of us.

28:11.206 --> 28:14.000
- Mm, that--
- Right, so--so what about him?

28:15.827 --> 28:19.620
Square, no weed, no nothing.

28:19.620 --> 28:21.965
- Um, well, what about him?

28:24.586 --> 28:27.344
- I can ask him, but his head
been hella fucked up

28:27.344 --> 28:29.034
lately, so--
- Shit.

28:29.034 --> 28:30.379
- So, look, what
about Babyface?

28:30.379 --> 28:34.517
- Ooh, shit, yes.

28:34.517 --> 28:37.241
I could do the Babyface

28:37.241 --> 28:40.689
all day...long.

28:40.689 --> 28:41.931
- Let me go get him.
- Okay.

28:41.931 --> 28:43.413
- I got you.
- Alright.

28:46.931 --> 28:48.689
- Are we really
about to do this?

28:48.689 --> 28:51.310
- Yes, so smoke.

28:51.310 --> 28:52.931
Okay?
- Uh-huh.

28:52.931 --> 28:54.724
- Because I'm gonna teach you
how to get over one man

28:54.724 --> 28:57.482
by getting under another.

28:57.482 --> 29:00.137
Just let yourself go.

29:00.137 --> 29:02.103
Let it go.

29:24.413 --> 29:27.482
- Next orgasms, we're
switching, okay?

29:27.482 --> 29:33.137
- Uh, that--

30:20.379 --> 30:21.620
- Here you go.

30:21.620 --> 30:25.310
- Mm, good night.

30:25.310 --> 30:26.931
Yes.

30:26.931 --> 30:29.896
- Maybe for Midnight and Face.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.103
- Where they at?

30:31.103 --> 30:32.482
- You know where they at.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.103
- I see.

30:34.103 --> 30:36.482
- Good night.

30:36.482 --> 30:37.896
- Bye.

30:50.655 --> 30:52.103
- Yo.

30:52.103 --> 30:53.793
-Did you
get the address?

30:53.793 --> 30:56.827
- You there now?
-Yeah.

30:56.827 --> 30:59.000
- Tina, you better
not be setting me up.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.275
-I promise, I'm not.

31:01.275 --> 31:03.862
- Alright, better
not be no bullshit.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.482
-I just wanna see you.

31:05.482 --> 31:07.482
I wanna hold you, shit.

31:07.482 --> 31:10.172
- Alright, I'm on my way.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.206
But, Tina, I'm letting you
know--

31:12.206 --> 31:14.275
-Doc, just come.

31:16.620 --> 31:17.793
- Alright.

31:24.689 --> 31:26.344
-This
motherfucker here.

31:48.241 --> 31:50.206
-It's a bit late
for a house call, isn't it?

31:56.137 --> 31:58.517
- I know it's in bad taste
dropping in on you

31:58.517 --> 31:59.758
like this unannounced.

31:59.758 --> 32:01.689
Um, I need a word.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.793
- Don't make a habit of it.

32:05.793 --> 32:08.068
Come in.

32:08.068 --> 32:10.655
- Ecuadorian Connecticut shade
with Nicaraguan

32:10.655 --> 32:12.793
Habanos fillers, yes?

32:12.793 --> 32:14.137
I remember seeing
them in your office.

32:18.241 --> 32:20.448
Anyway.

32:20.448 --> 32:23.620
I needed to be transparent with
you about

32:23.620 --> 32:25.344
the urgent nature of things.

32:26.931 --> 32:30.896
We usually process
2 1/2 to $3 million

32:30.896 --> 32:33.482
per property per year.

32:33.482 --> 32:37.482
You took a key piece
of our chess board.

32:37.482 --> 32:40.793
I'm sure you had your reasons,
none of which are my concern.

32:40.793 --> 32:43.793
But if our pieces aren't
properly moving,

32:43.793 --> 32:45.862
we are essentially losing.

32:45.862 --> 32:47.793
And that's problematic.

32:47.793 --> 32:51.034
Have you come to a decision?

32:51.034 --> 32:52.827
- Yes, I have.

32:52.827 --> 32:55.793
I do not...

32:55.793 --> 32:57.758
agree to your deal.

32:57.758 --> 32:59.379
- Really?

32:59.379 --> 33:02.206
- Yes. Really.

33:02.206 --> 33:07.896
I do however agree to process
300 a month,

33:07.896 --> 33:11.862
50 of that I keep.

33:11.862 --> 33:14.310
Take it or leave it.

33:17.034 --> 33:19.413
- You are what
they say you are.

33:19.413 --> 33:20.689
Fearless.

33:20.689 --> 33:23.827
Quite the businesswoman.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.655
- That and more.

33:25.655 --> 33:28.482
- I don't foresee them
taking issue with this deal.

33:28.482 --> 33:30.413
But I would like to confirm
with the family

33:30.413 --> 33:33.896
before we get anything going.

33:33.896 --> 33:36.344
- Very well.

33:36.344 --> 33:41.896
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
a very sexy,

33:41.896 --> 33:46.103
full-bodied glass
of red waiting for me.

33:48.551 --> 33:51.137
- Lucky glass.

33:51.137 --> 33:52.655
Enjoy your evening, Madam.

34:12.689 --> 34:16.310
- Hey.

34:16.310 --> 34:17.620
- Hey.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.965
- You ready?

34:18.965 --> 34:20.241
- Hell yeah, you
know I've been ready.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.206
- Okay, come on.

34:23.206 --> 34:28.896
- Wait, um...can I
ask you a question?

34:28.896 --> 34:31.551
- Yeah.

34:31.551 --> 34:35.896
- Dime, you--you
think this shit is me?

34:35.896 --> 34:37.241
- What?

34:37.241 --> 34:40.896
- Like all that,
all this,

34:40.896 --> 34:42.275
is it me?

34:43.827 --> 34:45.758
- What you mean?

34:45.758 --> 34:51.241
- I mean, like I like dancing
at the club for money, right?

34:51.241 --> 34:54.965
But, yo, these houses.

34:54.965 --> 34:57.172
They ain't got no rules.

34:57.172 --> 35:00.103
- You make your own rules as to
what you will do

35:00.103 --> 35:01.413
and what you won't do.

35:03.172 --> 35:07.172
- Yeah, that's true, but like
what if one night

35:07.172 --> 35:09.206
you're at the wrong house?

35:11.310 --> 35:12.827
- It has happened.

35:16.517 --> 35:20.724
- I don't know about
this shit, Dime.

35:20.724 --> 35:24.758
- Well, it seems like you
got some decisions to make.

35:24.758 --> 35:29.827
- That's true, but--yo, real
talk, I never made two grand.

35:31.103 --> 35:33.689
- No, for--I made
two grand tonight.

35:33.689 --> 35:35.724
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:35.724 --> 35:36.724
- That's good.

35:38.137 --> 35:39.862
- That's lit.

35:39.862 --> 35:43.172
But...is it me?

35:46.379 --> 35:50.034
- Okay, what is this?

35:50.034 --> 35:51.793
- I've just been
thinking, right?

35:54.413 --> 35:55.689
What am I doing with my future?

35:58.862 --> 36:01.482
- Your future?
- Yeah.

36:05.034 --> 36:09.655
- Well, the way I see it, you
got bills to pay right now.

36:09.655 --> 36:10.793
- True.

36:10.793 --> 36:12.344
- Keep some standards about
yourself,

36:12.344 --> 36:13.793
and you do what you gotta do.

36:18.896 --> 36:23.000
- You always gotta speak
some true shit, huh?

36:23.000 --> 36:25.275
- Damn right.

36:25.275 --> 36:27.827
- You got any other options?

36:27.827 --> 36:29.689
- Uh, shit, not right now.

36:29.689 --> 36:31.310
So--

36:31.310 --> 36:33.103
- Okay then, well
stop tripping.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.965
- Damn.

36:34.965 --> 36:38.793
- Do what you're comfortable
with and stop when you're not.

36:38.793 --> 36:40.689
- Alright, strong ass.

36:40.689 --> 36:43.275
- Yeah, now can
I take you home?

36:43.275 --> 36:44.586
Please?

36:44.586 --> 36:48.379
- Yes, you can take
me home, please.

36:50.137 --> 36:52.448
Come on.

36:52.448 --> 36:54.344
- Okay.
- Alright.

37:15.655 --> 37:16.827
- Tina.

37:18.103 --> 37:19.551
- Hey.

37:28.241 --> 37:31.034
- What are you doing?

37:31.034 --> 37:32.482
- Nothing.

37:32.482 --> 37:34.379
So, what's going on?

37:34.379 --> 37:36.862
Why you run?

37:36.862 --> 37:39.793
- I just...

37:39.793 --> 37:42.275
I'm sorry.

37:42.275 --> 37:44.517
- Yeah.

37:44.517 --> 37:46.344
What you doing in this place?

37:46.344 --> 37:48.551
- Nobody can find me here.

37:48.551 --> 37:50.275
- Yeah.

37:56.275 --> 37:57.896
- What is that?

38:01.586 --> 38:03.896
What are you looking for?

38:03.896 --> 38:07.655
- Just trying to make
sure...you're not setting me up.

38:10.172 --> 38:11.758
- Are you satisfied?

38:17.758 --> 38:20.551
- I'm satisfied.

38:20.551 --> 38:25.344
- Would I look like this
if I was setting you up?

38:29.896 --> 38:31.517
- I missed you.

39:09.241 --> 39:11.310
- What the fuck?

39:11.310 --> 39:14.655
- You keep lying to me.

39:14.655 --> 39:16.896
- Tina, what the fuck
are you talking about?

39:16.896 --> 39:20.137
- You told me you
would be with me.

39:20.137 --> 39:21.275
- Calm down.

39:21.275 --> 39:25.275
- You got some whore pregnant.

39:25.275 --> 39:28.206
- Calm...down.

39:28.206 --> 39:30.379
- She had a baby for you.

39:30.379 --> 39:33.310
I know.

39:33.310 --> 39:35.827
Shit, we all know.

39:37.034 --> 39:42.793
And then you let
that bitch kill my husband.

39:42.793 --> 39:45.517
You know he took care of me.

39:45.517 --> 39:48.689
What am I supposed to do, huh?

39:48.689 --> 39:50.586
And now you're fucking over me?

39:50.586 --> 39:53.448
- Just calm down.
- No!

39:53.448 --> 39:55.206
I'll get mad as shit.

39:55.206 --> 39:57.241
- Tina, that shit is sharp.

39:57.241 --> 40:00.379
- I'm cutting this
motherfucker off.

40:00.379 --> 40:01.965
- Tina, don't.
