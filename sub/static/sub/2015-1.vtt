my name's Jimmy Tong,

03:42.757 --> 03:45.760

there's anything I could say

that would convince you
to have a lunch with me.

Oh, Jimmy, you're so cute.

[Jimmy] You got me
nervous again.

- It's just a salesgirl.
- To you, but, to me...

04:02.944 --> 04:06.214
I dream of her
before I ever saw her.

04:06.314 --> 04:09.818
- No, that there! That!
That is the line.
- Shh.

04:09.918 --> 04:13.922
- Go tell her that. That line.
- Listen.

04:14.022 --> 04:17.225
Hi. My name
is Jimmy Tong.

04:17.325 --> 04:20.560
When I see you,
I have a wet dream.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.630
- Is that what I say?
- No, you know,

04:22.731 --> 04:24.465
just ask her out
to lunch now,

04:24.565 --> 04:26.735
and later,
we work out that line.

But hurry up, man.
We be wasting time, man.

Come on.
We have to drive.

[man 2] And whatever you do, do
not be yourself. Just joking.

- [woman] Thank you so much.
- [man] You're welcome. Goodbye.

Uh, let me, as owner
of this gallery,

of friendly advice.

05:46.014 --> 05:49.517
You go over there,
and you ask Jennifer out.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.920
- You think so?
- Yes.

05:52.020 --> 05:53.955
That way,
she can say "no"

05:54.055 --> 05:57.058
and we can get on
with our little lives.

05:59.127 --> 06:02.396

- Yeah.

he drowned?

14:04.177 --> 14:08.048
Well, there was water in his
lungs, but the pulmonary vein

14:08.148 --> 14:09.517
was filled with
collapsed platelets,

14:09.617 --> 14:13.587
indicative of dehydration.
He died of thirst.

- Thirst.
- It wasn't just city tap water.

15:58.926 --> 16:01.261
I've seen the way you drive. You
have the same instincts I do.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.963
You lack confidence.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.933
The girl in the art gallery's
not beyond you, you know.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.469
- You know about her?
- Every time we leave the house,

16:08.569 --> 16:10.538
we go by the art gallery
and slow down.

16:10.638 --> 16:13.707
You just need
a little polish.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.744
- I'll never be a Clark Devlin.
- Don't tell anyone this,

16:16.844 --> 16:19.079
but there's a lot less
to Clark than meets the eye.

16:19.179 --> 16:22.349
I've got a couple of good lines
and very expensive suits.

16:22.450 --> 16:24.317
Apart from that,
we're exactly the same.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.420
How about a couple
hundred million?

16:26.520 --> 16:28.088
Trust me. Ninety percent
of it is the clothes.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.790
The other ten percent?

16:29.890 --> 16:32.893
The other ten percent's in
there. You've got plenty of it.

16:32.993 --> 16:37.030
- Oh. Mr. Devlin,
can I ask you a big favor?
- Yeah?

16:37.130 --> 16:39.833
Can l stop
wearing my hat?

16:45.639 --> 16:47.307
- All right.
- Thank you.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.110
No, just stay smooth.
Remember, smooth.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.979
Thank you.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.349
Steena, Devlin.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.819
This driver, this Jimmy,
I like him.

16:58.919 --> 17:00.788
Let's get him
a proper suit.

17:00.888 --> 17:03.524
Something sexy.
You pick it out.

17:03.624 --> 17:07.194
All right. Always a delight
talking to you, too, darling.

17:07.294 --> 17:11.865
- Home, James.
- Absolutely, Mr. Devlin.

18:33.781 --> 18:37.217
This definitely

Hello. My name's
Clark Devlin.

18:39.853 --> 18:42.222

like to dance?

18:42.322 --> 18:45.092
Would you like
to dance? [chuckles]

18:45.192 --> 18:47.194
Admirable.

18:51.899 --> 18:54.602
There is just one rule:

18:54.702 --> 18:57.537
Never touch my tuxedo.

18:57.638 --> 19:00.240
- I didn't.
- Good.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.110
- Don't.
- Yes, sir.

19:04.244 --> 19:08.882
Jimmy, get the car.
Let's go for dinner.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.619
Yes, sir.

19:26.033 --> 19:27.901
What'll you have?
It's my treat.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.970
Anything.

19:30.070 --> 19:31.805
Two Whoppers, hold the
onion, extra ketchup.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.674
Toast the bottom bun only,
medium well done.

19:33.774 --> 19:35.242
Two large fries,
extra well-done.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.610
Two chocolate milkshakes,

19:36.710 --> 19:38.779
however the chef likes.
That's it.

19:38.879 --> 19:41.682
[woman] Your order's
ready. Pull forward.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.055
- That's pretty quick.
- It's fast food. Anything else?

19:48.155 --> 19:51.692
Yeah. I'll have a personal
pizza, crispy crust.

19:53.060 --> 19:56.997
He doesn't eat out much. They
don't serve pizza at Burger...

have chicken chow mein?

20:06.373 --> 20:07.808

- Jimmy?
- Yes? It's a drive-through.

Watch out!

- Watch it, man!
- Sorry, pal.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.629
Let's go.

20:40.774 --> 20:43.243
Why are we running away
from a skateboard?

20:43.343 --> 20:44.644
I think it's
probably a bomb.

you said "a bomb."

Yeah. Yeah, all
in a day's work.

Oh, damn.

22:27.881 --> 22:30.683
- Mr. Devlin.
- You got any aspirin?

- Who did this to you?
- Water Stri...

- OK.

I'm sorry.

Last time she was in here,
I was born.

23:49.162 --> 23:52.365
I'm sure my dad had something to
do with it. At least I hope so.

- I was nervous. How is he?
- He might be here a while.

You might want to get him
some things from home

24:17.757 --> 24:20.093

Nervous, but excited.
I'm pumped.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.161
I knew I was doing good work
for Banning International,

24:54.261 --> 24:57.564
but I didn't know Mr. Banning
would take notice of me so soon.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.833
When I'm CEO of this place, I
won't be having my headquarters

25:00.934 --> 25:03.836
in the bottom of a boat,
you know what I mean?

25:03.937 --> 25:07.107
[man] Why did you
choose Mr. Lundeen?

25:07.207 --> 25:10.110
He questioned
my growth projections.

25:16.283 --> 25:18.251
No, that's not it.

25:19.352 --> 25:22.055
I don't like
his hair.

25:23.790 --> 25:26.159
[man] Mr. Banning.

25:26.259 --> 25:30.730
So word filtered down to me
that you don't share my optimism

25:30.830 --> 25:35.102
- about our company's future.
- Oh, no. Actually, I just...

25:35.202 --> 25:37.504
- Drink?
- Oh, yes, thank you.

25:37.604 --> 25:40.440
I just felt that
to meet your projections,

25:40.540 --> 25:42.675
every person on Earth
would have to drink

25:42.775 --> 25:44.144
only Banning Springs water.

25:44.244 --> 25:47.047
Yes, indeed.
Water, Mr. Lundeen,

25:47.147 --> 25:49.349
comprises 60 percent
of your body.

25:49.449 --> 25:51.018
[Banning] Don't you
find it incredible

25:51.118 --> 25:53.686
that two hydrogen atoms
and an oxygen atom

25:53.786 --> 25:55.155
can combine to
create something

25:55.255 --> 25:58.725
so beautiful, so useful,
so essential?

25:58.825 --> 26:02.695
I find water to be...
miraculous.

26:02.795 --> 26:07.967
- [Banning] You think I'm silly?
- Not at all. [clears throat]

26:09.136 --> 26:11.771
- Feeling thirsty?
- Yes.

26:11.871 --> 26:15.475
You're helping me out by being
a guinea pig for a new product.

26:15.575 --> 26:19.012
Oh, I see.
What a brilliant idea.

26:19.112 --> 26:22.849
Water that makes you
thirsty. What's in it?

26:22.949 --> 26:26.019
- Salt?
- [heart beating]

26:26.119 --> 26:28.988
There's no
profundity in salt.

26:29.089 --> 26:30.890
Bacteria.

26:30.990 --> 26:35.762
Once ingested, its DNA will
instruct your cells' cytoplasm

26:35.862 --> 26:39.199
to spill electrolytes
into your bloodstream,

26:39.299 --> 26:41.368
causing dehydration.

26:41.468 --> 26:45.672
It's virulent, but,
unfortunately, it's too fast.

26:45.772 --> 26:50.343
Way too fast. As we speak, your
internal organs are shriveling.

26:50.443 --> 26:54.147
- Ah!
- [Banning] You're
becoming as dry as...

26:54.247 --> 26:58.585
Well, as dry as
your limited imagination.

won't you? Thank you.

- What? What accent?
- [Del] All right.

- Very funny.

- Hello.
- Mr. Devlin, there's
been a change of plans.

31:53.813 --> 31:56.215
- But I'm here. Where are you?
- Don't get all pissy.

31:56.315 --> 32:00.687
They just told me,
I'm telling you. We'll
meet tonight, 8:00, Pier 17,

and forget the password.

32:07.226 --> 32:10.463
- Oh, now you tell me.
- There he is.
Oh, my God, that's him.

32:10.563 --> 32:12.965
- I got to go.
See you tonight. Sorry.
- Get him!

32:13.065 --> 32:16.035
- [man] Stop!
- [woman] Get back here,
you creep!

32:39.158 --> 32:41.694
So we've got five minutes
to get into position.

32:41.794 --> 32:44.864
I secured the rooftop.
Equipment's good,
and I have to say

32:44.964 --> 32:48.968
it is such an honor to be
working with the legendary...

32:50.169 --> 32:53.039
...Clark Devlin?

32:54.807 --> 32:59.912
- I'm Del Blaine.
- Have we met before?

33:00.012 --> 33:03.115
- No.
- Good.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.752
OK, Del Blaine, let's do
what we've come here to do.

33:05.852 --> 33:11.491
- I'll follow you.
- Ladies first.

33:12.459 --> 33:14.594
OK.

33:16.362 --> 33:19.265
Couple of details changed
from what was in the
file. You read it?

33:19.365 --> 33:22.034
The files are crap.
Uh, give me the short version.

33:22.134 --> 33:25.337
Banning's holding a
meeting of international
water company CEOs.

33:25.438 --> 33:28.841
He's trying to force them
into selling their companies.

33:28.941 --> 33:31.911
- Where are you going?
- I'm thinking.

33:32.011 --> 33:34.847
We had Agent Wallace working
undercover at his factory.

33:34.947 --> 33:37.584
That is, until last week.
Wallace calls us
on his cell phone

33:37.684 --> 33:42.455
to tell us the operation
had reached critical mass
and, suddenly, wham! Dead.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.836
As you requested,

33:56.936 --> 34:00.473

20-time infrared sniper-scope

34:00.573 --> 34:03.042
and counterweighted
micro-rifled barrel.

34:05.244 --> 34:08.414
My favorite gun. But I
don't kill people anymore.

34:08.514 --> 34:11.449
Killing?
You're planting a bug.

34:11.551 --> 34:17.724
- It was in that "crap" file.
- Go look through
your binoculars.

34:23.663 --> 34:26.632
[beeping]

34:55.094 --> 34:57.129
They're arriving. Ready?

34:57.229 --> 35:01.233
It's critical we get a listening
device in Banning's meeting.

35:01.333 --> 35:05.672
- [beeping]
- [Del] Range: 962 feet.

35:05.772 --> 35:07.840
Aim for the briefcase.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.577
Should be a piece
of cake for you, sir.

35:13.546 --> 35:16.515
- [man screaming]
- [ship horn blaring]

35:19.051 --> 35:21.020
You kind of missed.

35:23.055 --> 35:25.658
[beeping]

35:53.786 --> 35:56.088
In the year 2001,

35:56.188 --> 36:00.760
$35 billion worth of bottled
water was consumed worldwide.

36:00.860 --> 36:04.530
Today, bottled water costs
more per gallon than gasoline.

36:04.631 --> 36:08.500
We, my friends,
are the new oil barons.

36:08.601 --> 36:12.404
[Banning on radio] We at
Banning Springs have developed
a new filtration process

36:12.504 --> 36:16.909
that would protect your assets
against the biological
holocaust that's coming.

36:17.009 --> 36:21.614
- Looks like we got company.
- CSA would be my bet.

36:23.215 --> 36:26.653
You've heard what I have to say.
Now I'd like to hear you.

36:26.753 --> 36:29.288
How much is this plan
gonna cost us?

36:29.388 --> 36:32.859
It won't cost you a penny,
out of pocket.
All I ask is to become

36:32.959 --> 36:36.162
your slightly-more-
than-equal partner.

36:36.262 --> 36:38.998
[Del] Banning says he's got the
only process to make water safe.

36:39.098 --> 36:41.300
To use it, they've got to give
him half of their companies?

36:41.400 --> 36:45.337
He's trying to muscle
these guys into selling
their companies to him.

36:45.437 --> 36:49.208
- [beeping]
- [Del] Banning says
water sources are in danger.

36:49.308 --> 36:52.411
Something about everyone being
defenseless against bacteria.

36:52.511 --> 36:57.183
I can barely make out
what he's saying.
Do you want to listen to this?

37:00.653 --> 37:02.689
- What do you think that means?
- Del Blaine!

37:02.789 --> 37:05.524
Yeah, I'll be
there in a minute.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.861
Yeah, I'd really like
some help up here, sir.

37:10.229 --> 37:13.232
- Del Blaine!
- [Del] Do you hear me, sir?

37:13.332 --> 37:15.735
I know this is not as exciting
as most of your missions,

37:15.835 --> 37:18.938
but could you humor me with
just a little professionalism?

37:19.038 --> 37:21.708
I would really
love some help...

37:21.808 --> 37:23.642
What are you doing?

37:25.511 --> 37:28.948
- What's with the jumpy-jumpy?
- Take off your headphones!

37:29.048 --> 37:31.117
- What?
- Your headphones!

37:39.792 --> 37:42.194
OK, chapter six
of the training manual.

37:42.294 --> 37:45.464
Unarmed assailant,
frontal attack. Begin!

37:45.564 --> 37:47.934
Stomach, head!
Stomach, head!

37:48.367 --> 37:49.869
[whimpers]

37:53.039 --> 37:54.306
Ah!

37:57.877 --> 38:02.248
God!
What's my name?! Yeah!

38:13.726 --> 38:17.930
- You OK? Oh!
- Where the hell have you been?!

38:19.065 --> 38:21.433
- [Del] Stop pushing!
- [man] Ow! My hand!

38:21.533 --> 38:23.435
Ah!

38:25.471 --> 38:28.174
[squealing]

38:35.982 --> 38:38.885
Yeah! Not bad. Sir?!

38:38.985 --> 38:43.722
Sir, are you OK, sir?

38:47.593 --> 38:52.264
- Don't let go! Don't!
- No, no, no, let go! [screams]

38:52.364 --> 38:56.135
[Del] You're
ripping my sleeve!

38:56.235 --> 38:57.970
[screams]

38:58.070 --> 39:00.506
No, no. No, not, not my...

39:00.606 --> 39:03.475
- Ah!
- Sir!

39:04.343 --> 39:05.778
My ring.

39:05.878 --> 39:09.015
[screaming]

39:14.686 --> 39:17.089
Oh, my God! Oh, my...

39:34.006 --> 39:37.776
This was not
part of the plan.

39:41.247 --> 39:43.015
Del Blaine?

39:52.491 --> 39:54.026
- Del!
- [footsteps]

40:24.756 --> 40:26.458
[beeping]

40:29.028 --> 40:30.829
Confidence.

40:43.542 --> 40:44.944
Del...

41:24.116 --> 41:28.054
[muttering] Moron...
Not in the manual.

41:30.656 --> 41:31.690
Creep!

41:31.790 --> 41:33.559
[tires squealing]

41:56.082 --> 41:59.085
Del Blaine! Stop!

42:06.192 --> 42:11.030
- Ah! Get off of me!
- Why didn't you stop?

42:11.130 --> 42:15.101
What the hell is wrong
with you?! How do you
fall off a building

42:15.201 --> 42:18.204
and end up... Oh!

42:18.304 --> 42:20.306
You OK?

42:21.540 --> 42:24.676
[both panting]

42:24.776 --> 42:26.712
Would you stop that?

42:26.812 --> 42:28.314
[Jimmy] It's OK.

42:28.414 --> 42:30.949
[Del] I am in the car
with a psychopath.

42:31.050 --> 42:33.119
- We are not safe.
- Are you upset?

42:33.219 --> 42:34.553
Why would I be upset?

42:34.653 --> 42:36.355
I've always wanted to
begin and end my career

42:36.455 --> 42:40.792
with a big fat failure!
Thank you very much, Mr. Devlin.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.528
It's my first time.

42:42.628 --> 42:45.497
I mean, every mission
is like my first time.

42:45.597 --> 42:49.201
It's so difficult
being Clark Devlin.

42:52.071 --> 42:55.341
Sorry.

42:55.441 --> 42:57.176
[screams]

42:57.276 --> 42:59.611
- Ah!
- [coughing]

42:59.711 --> 43:03.615
- I didn't do that.
- What is wrong with you?!

43:03.715 --> 43:06.985
- I'm not who you think I am.
- Stay away!

43:07.086 --> 43:10.956
I'm a little over-amped
myself right now.
Let's just call it a day.

43:11.057 --> 43:14.026
- Get some rest and medication.
- What?

43:14.126 --> 43:16.562
We'll be in
communication.

43:22.034 --> 43:24.570
I don't have
your phone number!

43:34.246 --> 43:38.717
[Del] Who am I kidding?
I have no idea what I'm doing
or why I'm doing it.

43:38.817 --> 43:41.520
[Steena] I felt the same way
when I took my first assignment.

43:41.620 --> 43:44.223
Then I met Devlin and life
just got a whole lot better,

43:44.323 --> 43:47.793
- and a little more complicated.
- [man] Can we get a close...?

43:47.893 --> 43:50.129
- [man 2] How do we pan...?
- [man] Hit the second button.

43:50.229 --> 43:54.333
Everybody warned me he was
unorthodox but he's irrational,
bordering on nutso.

43:54.433 --> 43:58.170
[man 2] We'll just get...
That's it. There, yeah.
That's it, there.

43:58.270 --> 44:00.239
- [man] Look at that.
- [man 2] Move it over a bit.

44:00.339 --> 44:04.743
He's getting under
your skin, isn't he?
He got under my skin once,

44:04.843 --> 44:06.678
and I'm still feeling it.

44:09.548 --> 44:12.318
Yeah, you told me.
What about his English?

44:12.418 --> 44:16.255
I can never understand
half of what he says,
but don't you love his accent?

44:16.355 --> 44:20.092
- She can't hear anything?
- No, I don't think... Whoa!

44:20.192 --> 44:23.095
God, I wish I was still
back in the field.

44:25.063 --> 44:27.199
How do you like me now?

44:34.306 --> 44:36.775
- She's got issues, man.
- [man] Holy...

44:36.875 --> 44:40.579
- [man 2] Can your
girlfriend shoot...?
- [man] A groin out of a target?

44:40.679 --> 44:44.450
Let's go.
Let's get our nails done.

44:44.550 --> 44:47.519
- OK.
- [Steena] Have a nice day.

44:47.619 --> 44:53.225
[woman on PA] Dr. Angelo,
Dr. Angelo...

44:53.325 --> 44:55.661
They ran out of
"Get well soon."

44:55.761 --> 44:58.264
You said to wear this,
but I don't know.

44:58.364 --> 45:01.833
Being Clark Devlin
is not easy.

45:01.933 --> 45:04.370
[phone rings]

45:06.972 --> 45:08.840
- Hello.
- [Del] So, Mr. Devlin,

45:08.940 --> 45:14.446
- how are you feeling today?
- Not so good, I'm afraid.

45:14.546 --> 45:17.183
[Del] You've got a few hours
to pull yourself together.

45:17.283 --> 45:20.252
- What do you mean?
- After the fiasco
of planting the bug,

45:20.352 --> 45:21.853
I'd say we have
only one choice:

45:21.953 --> 45:26.292
- Level One surveillance.
- In other words...

45:26.392 --> 45:28.827
Infiltration. Banning's
at the Lanford Hotel

45:28.927 --> 45:32.030
entertaining three of his
partners. Chalmers agreed to...

45:32.130 --> 45:35.567
- ...get us at the next table.
- Is this a black-tie event?

45:35.667 --> 45:37.536
No. But I'm sure you'll
wear whatever you want.

45:37.636 --> 45:39.905
Maybe we can
find Walter Strider.

45:40.005 --> 45:42.040
Meet you there at 8:00.

45:42.140 --> 45:44.576
- [Devlin] Water... strider...
- What?

45:44.676 --> 45:47.078
- Water...
- Mr. Clark Devlin.

45:47.179 --> 45:48.847
Strider...

45:48.947 --> 45:53.285
- What are you doing?
- Huh? Uh, he needs help.

45:53.385 --> 45:55.721
Security! Security!

46:27.753 --> 46:31.857
I know how partial you
are to that monkey suit,
so I got gussied up.

46:31.957 --> 46:34.393
Good job.
You gussy very well.

46:34.493 --> 46:38.264
And here's a little
something for you.

46:39.565 --> 46:42.401
Thank you. Sorry, I don't
have anything for you.

46:42.501 --> 46:44.870
- It's a video camera.
- Shh. Act normal.

46:44.970 --> 46:48.106
- We don't want
everybody to know.
- Sorry.

46:48.206 --> 46:50.108

Um...

46:57.182 --> 47:00.319

47:00.419 --> 47:03.289
- Washington.
- [chuckles]

47:03.389 --> 47:05.491
Washington.

47:07.526 --> 47:11.129
You're a billionaire
and you try to grease the guy
with seven bucks?

47:11.229 --> 47:15.501
- You think I have
money to throw away?
- You on the list?

47:15.601 --> 47:17.569
- Perfect.
- Let me talk to him.

47:17.669 --> 47:21.407
No. We'll do this
my way. I've got a T-135
disorientation module.

47:21.507 --> 47:23.542
You just stand there.

47:23.642 --> 47:29.415
Hi. Could you hold this
for me? Aw, thanks.

47:29.515 --> 47:33.885
Now, where did I
put those tickets?

47:33.985 --> 47:36.722
- What's happening, Snowman?
- What's happening?

47:36.822 --> 47:40.326
- What's happening, Snowman?
- What's happening, Snowman?

47:40.426 --> 47:42.361
Hey, what's happening?

Oh, hey.

I can't believe it. James Brown.

47:55.607 --> 47:57.476
- Hello.
- [Brown] What's happening?

47:57.576 --> 48:00.612
Forgive us for bothering you.
We came to see your show and...

48:00.712 --> 48:02.848
- She forgot to make
reservations.
- Don't worry about it.

48:02.948 --> 48:07.218
- I can get tickets
for the front row.
- Oh! Thank you very much.

48:07.319 --> 48:10.989
- See? The things work out.
- [Brown] One more thing
I'd like to say.

48:11.089 --> 48:14.660
It's not the in thing
today to give compliments
to a young lady,

48:14.760 --> 48:16.995
but I just got
to let you know that...

48:17.095 --> 48:19.498
...you got a nice rack.

48:19.598 --> 48:23.669
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Brown.
- Enjoy the show.

48:23.769 --> 48:25.203
Whoa!

48:25.303 --> 48:28.907
- What is wrong with you?!
- He fell down by himself.

48:29.007 --> 48:32.644
- You killed James Brown.
- No, he's fine.

48:32.744 --> 48:35.414
He's not fine.
And Banning is gonna leave.

48:35.514 --> 48:38.083
Don't panic.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

48:38.183 --> 48:42.754
- Are you... praying?
- Miss Cleo told me
this would happen.

48:42.854 --> 48:46.024
- $4.99-a-minute Miss Cleo?
- Just go out and tell them

48:46.124 --> 48:50.429
Mr. Brown is not here.
There will be another act.

be appearing tonight

Don't touch the tequila
for me and Mr. Banning.

01:08:14.792 --> 01:08:16.493
- Whatever you say.
- Yes.

01:08:16.594 --> 01:08:19.529
- Louder!
- [both] Yes, Dr. Simms.

01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:21.966
We better hope the
little ones follow the queen.

01:08:22.066 --> 01:08:24.468
If they don't the stock
is gonna be worthless.

01:08:24.569 --> 01:08:27.671
- Follow the queen?
- Have you seen Cheryl?

01:08:27.772 --> 01:08:30.707
- Maybe he's gay.
- Cheryl? No.

01:08:30.808 --> 01:08:33.944
[man] Man, let's get out of
here. Let's go have a smoke.

01:08:41.786 --> 01:08:44.654
Hey. How did you...?

01:08:44.755 --> 01:08:46.657
Whatever.

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:49.560
[Jimmy] Look at this.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.395

He's pinpointed the
national reservoirs.

01:08:53.964 --> 01:08:55.933
[Jimmy] He's going to
poison the water?

01:08:56.033 --> 01:08:57.434
Not with that stuff.
It's too detectable

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:58.868
and there's
government safeguards.

01:08:58.969 --> 01:09:00.537
Let's check out
the computer.

01:09:00.638 --> 01:09:02.673
Now, you're thinking.

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:09.145
- Who are they?
- They shouldn't be in the lab.

01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:11.548
Let's go.

01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:13.917

- Oh, your God what?

Drink it, you'll

01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:27.598
The big question is,
how is he gonna

01:09:27.698 --> 01:09:30.000
introduce it
into the water supply?

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:34.304
- [door opening]
- I think we better go.

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:40.144
Quick, over there
by the wall.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.582
- Nobody here.
- Let's check the hatchery.

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:52.156
[Del] You're on my foot.

01:09:55.459 --> 01:09:58.729
- What was that about?
- Shh. Go!

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.332
How did they miss us?
Are they blind?

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:04.769
Don't look up my skirt.

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.362
Banning's got the bacteria,
but has to transport it

01:10:32.462 --> 01:10:35.565
- from his lab to the water.
There's no way he can.
- Maybe with airplanes.

01:10:35.666 --> 01:10:40.304
Not possible. Besides,
even if he could get it
to a reservoir undetected,

01:10:40.404 --> 01:10:42.873
an alarm would trigger the
second the surface is broken.

01:10:42.973 --> 01:10:44.842
You're really smart.

01:10:44.942 --> 01:10:47.511
It's an act. I'm an
inexperienced girl

Come on, stop humoring me.
Just be honest.

Yeah. Yeah,
I can handle it.

01:11:19.243 --> 01:11:23.914

- Can we go somewhere
and be alone?

01:11:24.014 --> 01:11:26.050
Sure.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.923
- I didn't know you
were so strong.
- Take off your clothes.

01:11:33.023 --> 01:11:36.160
- Let's not do
anything we'll regret.
- Take off your clothes.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:38.662
- What's happening?
- I knew the second I met you

01:11:38.763 --> 01:11:41.732
you weren't Clark Devlin.
Take off the tuxedo,
it doesn't belong to you

01:11:41.832 --> 01:11:43.934
I wanted to tell you,
but I just didn't know how.

01:11:44.034 --> 01:11:48.138
- Take off your clothes.
What is that?

01:11:48.238 --> 01:11:51.475
- Hey! You, out here!
- OK.

01:11:51.575 --> 01:11:53.610
- Take the clothes.
- OK.

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:57.514
Slow down. My name is Jimmy

01:11:57.614 --> 01:11:59.483

find Walter Strider.

I don't want to hear your lies.
Give me the watch and the shoes.

Where's Clark? How'd you
think you were gonna
get away with this?

01:12:05.923 --> 01:12:08.926
Things happened.
I decided to go with the flow.

01:12:09.026 --> 01:12:12.429
- What about the underwear?
- They're mine.

01:12:12.529 --> 01:12:15.866
I mean, my roommate.

01:12:15.966 --> 01:12:19.303

[Jimmy] Dear Mr. Devlin,

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:30.374
I did the best I could,
but it wasn't good enough.

01:13:30.474 --> 01:13:35.312
I did not find Walter Strider
for you. I also
lost your tuxedo.

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:37.581
I'm sure you will
get it back.

01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:44.088
I guess I will go back to being
what I was before I met you.

01:14:12.983 --> 01:14:15.552
Water strider.

01:14:20.357 --> 01:14:24.995
Water strider.
Water strider! Stupid!

01:14:25.095 --> 01:14:29.934
- [Banning] My beautiful
little darlings.
- [Del] Gerris maginatus.

01:14:30.034 --> 01:14:35.505
Species native
to Southeast Asia. Commonly
known as the water strider.

01:14:35.605 --> 01:14:37.874
Walter Strider.

01:14:37.975 --> 01:14:40.911
Yes, the water strider.
Very good. Very good.

01:14:41.011 --> 01:14:44.781
Well, it's brilliant.
They touch down
on the reservoirs.

01:14:44.881 --> 01:14:48.485
Their little feet transfer
deadly bacteria without
breaking the surface

01:14:48.585 --> 01:14:53.123
so no alarms sound, and it
looks like a nasty
little trick of nature.

01:14:53.223 --> 01:14:57.094
Fortunately, there is one
drinkable water source.

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:00.965
- Yours.
- [laughs]

01:15:01.065 --> 01:15:05.936
Dietrich, you're a genius.
Too bad it won't work.

01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:12.742
Oh! You so wrong.
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong.

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:16.513
It will work because my plan
is perfect. Sorry, Mr. Banning,

01:15:16.613 --> 01:15:20.484
it's your plan...
and mine. It's ours.

01:15:20.584 --> 01:15:24.254
- Shut up. Explain.
- Oh. Alrighty.

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:28.292
The life cycle of the Gerris
maginatus begins with mating,

01:15:28.392 --> 01:15:32.762
something Dr. Simms is not
personally familiar with.

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:35.865
Anyhoo, the insects
swarm to fresh water,

01:15:35.966 --> 01:15:38.902
where fertilized eggs are
then deposited on the
underside of lotus leaves

01:15:39.003 --> 01:15:44.508
- and hatch into larvae.
- Spare me the
Discovery Channel blather.

01:15:44.608 --> 01:15:49.179
- Tell me why it won't work.
- Yes, tell us.

01:15:49.279 --> 01:15:54.184
Why it won't work? This is the
northern hemisphere, correct?

01:15:54.284 --> 01:15:57.421
You incubated insects native
to the southern hemisphere.

01:15:57.521 --> 01:16:01.525
So, simply, it is too cold
for them to mature sexually,

01:16:01.625 --> 01:16:04.528
much like Simms here.

01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:10.134
Therefore, they won't mate.
Therefore, they won't
seek out water.

01:16:10.834 --> 01:16:13.170
- Is this true?
- No.

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:16.806
I knew a girl once, in college,
quite well. Very well.

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:21.645
- And then you
remember cousin Doris?
- No, Simms, the bugs.

01:16:21.745 --> 01:16:26.083
The bugs. Oh! You're not
gonna believe this hoochie,

01:16:26.183 --> 01:16:28.985
- are you, Mr. Banning?
- Oh, yeah?

01:16:29.086 --> 01:16:31.388
Ask him if I lied
about the tuxedo.

01:16:31.488 --> 01:16:33.923
This tuxedo is...
It's all right. It's...

01:16:34.024 --> 01:16:39.463
All right? That is the
most incredible piece of
technology on the planet.

01:16:39.563 --> 01:16:44.901
And I am laying it
in your big, hot hands.

01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:49.439
- Mr. Banning, release the bugs.
- Go ahead.
Do what he tells you.

01:16:49.539 --> 01:16:53.043
You might have a chance
at second prize at a

His head's about to explode.
Look at him.

01:23:12.088 --> 01:23:14.791
Look at him!

01:23:16.259 --> 01:23:21.631
You might know a few tricks, but
you're just a sad, pathetic man.

01:23:36.279 --> 01:23:37.747
Ah!

01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:47.924
Smoking is bad

01:23:48.024 --> 01:23:51.060
- You OK?
- Yeah, duh.
By the way, nice going.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:55.499
Millions of people

You left the hatch open.

01:23:55.599 --> 01:23:58.134
[Jimmy] They're not
flying away.

01:23:58.234 --> 01:24:03.873

[Del] Oh, my God.
For once, you're right.

01:24:08.745 --> 01:24:10.446
The queen is gonna
lead the striders

01:24:10.547 --> 01:24:12.448

01:26:58.682 --> 01:27:00.684

01:27:01.317 --> 01:27:02.652
Trouble.

01:27:13.997 --> 01:27:17.566
OK, OK, make hustle, ladies.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:27:17.667 --> 01:27:19.736
Watch out, Aqua Lung.

01:27:19.836 --> 01:27:21.905
Hey, pal, nice suit.

01:27:22.005 --> 01:27:24.007
It's OK. Everything's
gonna be all right.

01:27:24.107 --> 01:27:26.509
It's not OK.
You just decked the hero.

01:27:26.609 --> 01:27:29.913
I'm a genius and I can testify
for a piece of immunity.

01:27:30.013 --> 01:27:33.683
- Also, I'm from
a neutral country...
- Shut it.

01:27:33.783 --> 01:27:35.484
Looks like we
got here just in time.

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:38.621
- To what? Take credit?
- You're hilarious, Blaine.

01:27:38.722 --> 01:27:42.525
Winton Chalmers, CSA.
I spearheaded the operation
that took down Banning.

01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:46.662

- Here's your tuxedo.
You happy now?

01:27:46.763 --> 01:27:49.632
I will be when I get it
safely back to headquarters.

01:27:49.733 --> 01:27:53.369
By the way, Blaine,
not a bad job for your
first time in the field.

01:27:53.469 --> 01:27:57.473
- I didn't do it alone.
- She always says
nice things about me.

01:27:57.573 --> 01:27:59.909
You finally do something right,
you deserve the credit.

01:28:00.009 --> 01:28:03.747
Well, sir, it's an honor to help
the United States of America.

01:28:03.847 --> 01:28:05.949
I feel exactly
the same way, soldier.

01:28:06.049 --> 01:28:07.683
Don't think you're
gonna be able to get away

01:28:07.784 --> 01:28:09.853
with a bureaucratic
pat on the butt, do you?

01:28:09.953 --> 01:28:13.056
- Well, I'm hoping to.
- [laughing]

01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:24.433
Ooh! Man down, people.

01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:32.275
Well... there is one thing
you can do for me.

01:28:32.375 --> 01:28:36.145
- And that would be?
- [Steena] Tracking systems
locked on.

01:28:36.245 --> 01:28:38.181
Anybody screws up,
your ass is mine.

01:28:38.281 --> 01:28:40.817
- Block off this end
of the street.
- [man] Roger.

01:28:40.917 --> 01:28:43.219

- [man] Roger that.
- [Steena] Hustle, people.

01:29:05.241 --> 01:29:06.642
[man] The package
is on the move.

01:29:06.742 --> 01:29:09.946
All right,
it's show time.

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:13.817
- How's our package?
- I forget what to say.

01:29:13.917 --> 01:29:18.955
But you can do this.
Focus. Go. Go.

01:29:19.055 --> 01:29:21.590
- [man] Package dropped.
- [man 2] Roger. Target locked.

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:23.960
Jimmy, what do you say?

01:29:27.931 --> 01:29:30.299
The name's Tong.

01:29:30.399 --> 01:29:32.969
James Tong.

01:29:33.069 --> 01:29:35.338
I'm the man.
I'm the man.

01:29:35.438 --> 01:29:38.341
- [Steena] Del, you tell
him to say that?
- [Del] No. Well, sort of.

01:29:38.441 --> 01:29:40.910
- [Steena] Oh, God.
- [Devlin] Ladies, relax.

01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:42.846
- He's pumping out pheromones.
- [Steena] Shut up.

01:29:42.946 --> 01:29:46.182
- [Devlin] I'm in charge.
- [Steena] Package is locked on
target.

01:29:46.282 --> 01:29:48.184
Why did you
wear those pants?

01:29:48.284 --> 01:29:50.086
- [Devlin] He's stopping.
- [Del] What for?

01:29:50.186 --> 01:29:51.888
[Devlin] Use the door, Jimmy.

01:29:51.988 --> 01:29:53.656
- [man] He's breathing heavy.
- [man 2] Seen her?

01:29:53.756 --> 01:29:56.059
[man] He's out of his league,
if you know what l mean.

01:29:56.159 --> 01:29:57.894
- [Devlin] A hunter.
- [man] Gallery owner.

01:29:57.994 --> 01:30:00.930
- [Steena] Quiet.

01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:03.166
- [Steena] Clark, focus.
- He's about to speak.

01:30:03.266 --> 01:30:05.301
- Open your mouth.
- Hi.

01:30:05.401 --> 01:30:08.637
- Hi.
- That's the girl?

01:30:08.737 --> 01:30:12.141
- She's not that pretty.
- [Steena] Jimmy,
smile, come on.

01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:14.777
- [Devlin] Move on, quick.
- He doesn't look so good.

01:30:14.878 --> 01:30:16.880
- Doesn't look so good.
- Doesn't look so good.

01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:18.747
- Doesn't look so good.
- Give him a line.

01:30:18.848 --> 01:30:21.885
- Steena, shut up.
- [Devlin] Look deep
into her eyes...

01:30:21.985 --> 01:30:24.653
- [Del] Clark, no.
- [man] He's hyperventilating.

01:30:24.753 --> 01:30:29.125
- Don't listen. Listen to me.
- I can't think with you
screaming in my ear.

01:30:29.225 --> 01:30:31.194
- [Steena] Everybody calm down.
- Not you, her.

01:30:31.294 --> 01:30:34.230
- No, no, her, her.
- Look deep into her eyes,

01:30:34.330 --> 01:30:36.966
and tell her you had
a dream about her last night.

01:30:37.066 --> 01:30:39.102
- Be quiet.
- Del, will you shut up?

01:30:39.202 --> 01:30:40.603
Uh...

01:30:40.703 --> 01:30:43.306
I hate to say, but don't take
advice from women about women.

01:30:43.406 --> 01:30:46.910
- [Del] Shut up.
- The voice is
screaming in my ear.

01:30:47.010 --> 01:30:49.812
If you can hear me,
wipe that look off your face.

01:30:49.913 --> 01:30:54.350
Remember me? Hooters.
Soul patch.

01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:56.619
OK, I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

01:30:56.719 --> 01:30:58.955
- I'm the love of my life...
- [Devlin] No, no!

01:30:59.055 --> 01:31:00.423
You're the love
of my life.

01:31:00.523 --> 01:31:01.891
[Devlin] Never tell
them you love them.

01:31:01.991 --> 01:31:04.293
Can you have
dinner with me?

01:31:04.393 --> 01:31:05.694
Get out.

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:07.696
Pretty sure
he crapped his pants.

01:31:07.796 --> 01:31:08.864
[Jimmy] I just want
to have dinner.

01:31:08.965 --> 01:31:09.798
- Get out now.
- [Jimmy] Lunch?

01:31:09.899 --> 01:31:11.400
- Now!
- Oh!

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.236
[Steena] We're
terminating this mission.

01:31:13.336 --> 01:31:16.572
Pack it up
and roll home.

01:31:16.672 --> 01:31:20.243
- I think I blew it, Mr. Devlin.
- I wrote the book
on this stuff.

01:31:20.343 --> 01:31:22.211
You didn't blow it.
You outgrew her.

01:31:22.311 --> 01:31:25.048
- Maybe.
- [Devlin] Tell you what.

01:31:25.148 --> 01:31:28.484
Take the weekend off.
Monday, we'll head somewhere
with interesting prospects.

01:31:28.584 --> 01:31:33.089
- How about Monte Carlo?
- Sounds good.
Thanks, Mr. Devlin.

01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:35.791
- Thanks, everybody.
- [man] It's OK, Jimmy.

01:31:35.891 --> 01:31:37.360
- Hang in there.
- [man 2] Next time.

01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:39.762
Well, if you were trying
to get her to notice you,

01:31:39.862 --> 01:31:41.564
mission accomplished.

01:31:41.664 --> 01:31:44.800
What are you planning
for the second date?
Running at her with a knife?

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:46.602
- It's difficult for me.
- What is so hard?

01:31:46.702 --> 01:31:51.140
You just have to say
something like, "You want
to go get some coffee?"

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.343
When I around beautiful
women, I can't talk.

01:31:54.443 --> 01:31:57.646
- Sure. Beautiful women.
- You know, a real knockout.

01:31:57.746 --> 01:32:03.186
- Like the beautiful lady
in the gallery.
- Thank you very much.

01:32:03.286 --> 01:32:07.290
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:11.360
- What?
- You can't tell how I feel?

01:32:12.095 --> 01:32:14.998
- You look sad.
- No.

01:32:15.098 --> 01:32:17.866
- Sick?
- No.

01:32:17.967 --> 01:32:22.171
- Constipated?
- No.

01:32:22.271 --> 01:32:25.308
- A little.
- Tell me, what's wrong?

01:32:25.408 --> 01:32:29.212
It's just no guy would ever
do anything for me
like what you did for her.

01:32:29.312 --> 01:32:33.349
- Or tried to do.
- You know why?

01:32:33.449 --> 01:32:37.853
Because you are
a pain in the butt.

01:32:37.953 --> 01:32:40.689
Yeah, nice working
with you, too.

01:32:42.125 --> 01:32:45.328
Hello. Delilah, excuse me.

01:32:46.162 --> 01:32:47.963
You want to have a coffee?

01:32:48.064 --> 01:32:50.666
I only drink
organic green tea.

01:32:50.766 --> 01:32:55.671
Eh! Wrong answer. You're
never gonna have a boyfriend.

01:32:55.771 --> 01:32:57.940
Fine. Coffee.

01:32:58.041 --> 01:33:02.278
- I love coffee.
- You learn quick.

01:33:04.247 --> 01:33:06.549
Is that your happy face
or your horny face?

01:33:06.649 --> 01:33:08.317
I tell you later.

01:33:08.417 --> 01:33:13.322

- Huh?
- [woman] Is this
a bunch of crap?

01:33:49.692 --> 01:33:51.127
Is this a bunch crap?

01:33:51.227 --> 01:33:54.297
- [woman] Bunch of crap.
- OK.

01:33:54.397 --> 01:33:57.300
You think I'm speak
very good English?

- [man] That's OK. Cut.
- No wonder.

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:09.345
This is why you
don't have a boyfriend.

01:34:10.179 --> 01:34:13.182
- That's...

- Fraud.

01:34:17.853 --> 01:34:19.355
[laughing]

01:34:19.455 --> 01:34:22.991
Look at her ugly face.
Every time I look...

01:34:23.092 --> 01:34:25.761
Every time,
she just like this.

01:34:26.962 --> 01:34:28.297
How can I act?

01:34:28.397 --> 01:34:30.799
- Can we do a single on me?
- No.

01:34:30.899 --> 01:34:33.769
[mumbling] Ah!

01:34:33.869 --> 01:34:36.672
No, no, no. Cut! Cut!

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:44.847
- They'll take us to the lab.
- Who?

01:34:44.947 --> 01:34:46.182
[laughing]

01:34:46.282 --> 01:34:50.286
- Let's... [laughing]
- Cut.

01:34:50.386 --> 01:34:53.489
I got the happy
partner over here.

01:34:56.359 --> 01:35:00.196
Jimmy. What do you...?
[laughing]

01:35:02.598 --> 01:35:06.802
She smile the whole movie.
Waste of film, waste of time.

01:35:06.902 --> 01:35:09.172
What is she doing?

01:35:09.272 --> 01:35:11.340
- * Hit me
- Oh, no!

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:13.909
You're fast.

01:35:14.009 --> 01:35:15.878
But I'm faster.

01:35:15.978 --> 01:35:18.214
[Brown] Good God!
