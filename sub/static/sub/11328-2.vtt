Of american Teenger".

00:03.300 --> 00:04.200
you want to help me out?

00:04.200 --> 00:04.900
If i help you out,

00:04.900 --> 00:06.500
you'll never learn
to do this on your own.

00:06.600 --> 00:07.900
Mom, you're gaining weight.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.300
You're tired all the time.
Your hands and feet are swollen!

00:10.400 --> 00:12.100
How could you be pregnant
at your age?

00:12.200 --> 00:13.600
I don't mind
if my dad dates.

00:13.700 --> 00:15.800
I just don't see her
as stepmother material.

00:15.900 --> 00:18.000
Jack and i are having sex
for the first time.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.500
You can't keep jack
just by having sex with him.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.700
Any possibility that
she's pregnant with your baby?

00:23.900 --> 00:24.600
Nope.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.600
I'm not comfortable
with ricky hanging out

00:26.600 --> 00:27.400
In your room all the time.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.100
He's not there for me.
He's there for john.

00:29.200 --> 00:29.900
I want to have sex.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.700
I just had a baby.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.000
I just don't like that
he's going away on a long trip

00:34.000 --> 00:35.700
And the two of you
are at odds with each other.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.700
You haven't been around
for 16 years

00:37.800 --> 00:39.800
And now it's your business
if i'm here with adrian.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.800
I know more about her
than you do.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.300
You're absolutely sure that
the vasectomy worked, right?

00:44.400 --> 00:46.200
I feel stronger
than i ever have.

00:46.300 --> 00:47.600
We just had sex.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.500
Marshall's dead!

00:49.500 --> 00:52.200
There was a plane crash.
It was a private jet.

00:52.800 --> 00:53.900
I'm sorry.

Mrs. Bowman,
i'm so sorry.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.200
Thank you, adrian.

01:11.900 --> 01:12.800
Please, come in.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.800
Is there anything
i can do?

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
How's grace?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.500
Oh, she's not
doing very well.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.100
Not that any of us are.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.300
Oh, honey?

01:27.800 --> 01:28.900
Adrian's here.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.500
Let's see if grace
will talk to her.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.400
Why? It is her fault.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.600
Tom, it isn't anyone's fault.

01:34.700 --> 01:37.800
Grace killed him,
but she is the one

01:37.800 --> 01:41.700
Who made sex look like fun.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.600
That's why grace had sex.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.900
And that's why dad is dead.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.900
I'll go talk to her.
Okay?

01:49.100 --> 01:50.000
Thank you, adrian.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.200
Don't worry, mom.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.400
I will take care of you.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.200
I am the man
of the house now.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.600
Oh.

02:06.700 --> 02:07.400
Grace?

02:10.300 --> 02:11.300
Grace, it's me.

02:19.500 --> 02:20.600
I'm sorry.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Grace, i'm sorry
about your dad.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.300
Do you want to talk?

02:26.300 --> 02:28.100
Just talk to me, grace.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.300
Go away.

02:29.600 --> 02:30.800
All right, grace.

02:31.100 --> 02:35.100
But if you need
someone to talk to, Call me, okay?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.700
Grace, you don't think you...

02:48.600 --> 02:50.800
you don't think you killed
your father, do you?

02:51.900 --> 02:53.300
You didn't kill him, grace.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.100
You would never kill anyone.

02:55.100 --> 02:56.700
You would never even
hurt anyone.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.900
It was an accident.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.700
It was an accident.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.300
I can't believe you would
do this to this family.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.400
He didn't do this
to this family. I did.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.600
- No-
- So just go home.

03:17.700 --> 03:18.900
I don't want
to talk to you.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.600
I don't want
to talk to anybody.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.200
Just get out!

03:22.201 --> 03:22.751

Oh, hi, kathleen.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.600
I was gonna call you,
but i don't know what to say.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.100
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.300
I need some help.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.100
George,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.500
My parents aren't here
and marshall has no family.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.700
And... well...

04:26.200 --> 04:28.100
i need you to do
something for me,

04:28.100 --> 04:28.900
If you would.

04:29.000 --> 04:29.600
Anything.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.500
And i mean that.
Anything.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.100
I guess you heard
about dr. Bowman?

04:40.400 --> 04:41.100
I did.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.900
Mom and i wanted to go by to see
grace and her family This morning,

04:43.900 --> 04:45.700
take something by to them,

04:46.200 --> 04:48.000
But i had to drop
john off.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.100
Maybe we should
go over there after school.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.500
How am i gonna do that?
I have to go to work.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.400
Right. Yeah.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.100
And you have to go to work.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.700
Are you staring
at my breasts again?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.100
No. No, i'm sad.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.200
I'm looking down
because i am down.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.200
- I'm sad.
- You are disgusting.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.500
If you don't want me
to look at you-

05:08.600 --> 05:10.700
If you don't want every guy
in this school to look at you,

05:10.700 --> 05:13.300
Then why do you...
dress like that?

05:13.500 --> 05:14.800
Because i want to.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.300
That's kind of
hard to argue with.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.300
But why do you want to?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.600
Why do you want
to do what?

05:19.000 --> 05:19.900
Nothing.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.500
- Did you hear about grace's dad?
- Yeah.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
We should call her.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.200
Or take something over
for the family.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.100
Or send flowers or something.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.300
I think my mom and i
are going by there tonight

05:30.300 --> 05:32.900
If ricky can babysit,
and i don't know if he can

05:33.000 --> 05:34.900
Since he'll probably want
to go over there, too.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.000
I can babysit.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.300
- No, i don't think so.
- Why not?

05:38.500 --> 05:40.300
Ben, you've never
been alone with john.

05:40.700 --> 05:41.800
Alice and henry
will come by.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.700
- No.
- We can babysit.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.600
Yeah, i'd love to babysit.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.000
Then you could go over
for all three of us.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.800
I'm just not that good
with death.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.200
You don't need
to go over there.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.500
I need to go over there.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.300
Grace made it possible
for me to keep the baby

05:54.300 --> 05:55.500
By finding me a job,

05:55.500 --> 05:57.800
And she totally supported me
when i came back to school.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.900
I have to.
I want to go.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.400
The three of us could go.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.500
We should.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.300
The three of us,
as friends.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.600
Uh, if ricky can babysit.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.500
I'm still here.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.800
The four of us can go.
Our driver can take us.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.000
No, i can't.

06:12.700 --> 06:13.900
I don't want to.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.700
I don't really
want to go, either,

06:17.700 --> 06:19.600
So i'll just stay
with madison.

06:19.700 --> 06:22.000
And if you don't
need us to babysit-

06:22.100 --> 06:23.600
You don't really think
you could handle a baby

06:23.600 --> 06:24.700
for a couple of hours?

06:24.700 --> 06:25.700
Not really.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.100
But i do think ben could.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.900
- Really?
- Yeah, i do.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.800
Thanks, lauren.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.700
- I have to get to class.
- I can babysit. Let me do it.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.900
Not with me and my mom
both out of the house, ben.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.300
I love you,
most of the time,

06:42.300 --> 06:44.100
But you can't
babysit john. Not yet.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.300
And i- I don't mean
to hurt your feelings by saying that.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.400
You're really good
at holding him,

06:47.500 --> 06:49.500
But you've never even
changed his diaper.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.000
So thanks for offering,

06:51.100 --> 06:52.500
But really,
ricky can help.

06:52.900 --> 06:54.200
John is his responsibility.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.700
I'll see you later,
okay?

07:10.100 --> 07:11.700
- How was she?
- Terrible.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.100
She thinks it's all her fault
for some reason.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.800
- What?
- That's what she's thinking-

07:15.800 --> 07:17.200
That she killed
her own father.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.800
But tom feels that even though
grace killed him,

07:21.200 --> 07:22.200
It's my fault.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.000
- How could it be your fault?
- I don't know.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.200
How could it be
anyone's fault?

07:25.200 --> 07:26.300
It was a plane crash.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.400
I didn't cause it.
Neither did grace.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.600
Why would she think that?

07:29.700 --> 07:30.700
Because she had sex.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.200
Her dad told her she and jack
needed to wait,

07:33.200 --> 07:35.200
And apparently they didn't.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.200
- What?
- I told her she wasn't ready.

07:37.300 --> 07:39.900
I knew she wasn't ready,
but she did it anyway.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.500
And that caused
the plane to crash?

07:41.700 --> 07:43.000
Grace is superstitious.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.500
You mean religious,
don't you?

07:45.200 --> 07:46.500
Grace had sex?

07:46.700 --> 07:47.300
Yep.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.200
Hi, adrian, ricky.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.000
Hi.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.200
Sorry to interrupt,

07:52.400 --> 07:53.700
But, ricky, could you
come over tonight

07:53.700 --> 07:55.500
And watch john so i can
go to grace's house?

07:55.600 --> 07:56.800
she doesn't want
to see anyone.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.200
I went over
on my way to school.

07:58.300 --> 07:59.500
My mom and i
want to go by.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.900
Just for a few minutes.

08:01.000 --> 08:01.600
No.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.400
I just said she doesn't
want to see anyone.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.700
My father was married
to grace's mother.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.400
Uh-Huh.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.500
Listen, i know you think
you're an adult

08:09.500 --> 08:11.500
Now that you're a mother,
but you're not.

08:11.600 --> 08:14.100
So stop acting like you're older
and wiser than anyone else.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.800
Who says mrs. Bowman
and grace and tom

08:15.800 --> 08:17.000
Want you and your mother
over there?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.300
I'll take care
of grace, okay?

08:18.400 --> 08:19.400
She's my friend.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.800
She's my best friend.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.000
She's my friend, too.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.700
And i want to see her.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.600
So could you watch john?

08:27.700 --> 08:28.600
I guess. Yeah.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.500
Are you going over there,
to grace's house?

08:30.600 --> 08:31.400
We're not married.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.200
I don't have to tell you
what my plans are.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.500
Yet i have to tell you
what my plans are

08:35.500 --> 08:37.100
Every time i need
to go somewhere.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.799
- Around 7?
- Yeah.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.100
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you with grace?

08:44.200 --> 08:46.400
She doesn't want me there
and i didn't feel like being home alone.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.200
What am i gonna do?

08:47.300 --> 08:48.900
We made love for
the first time last night,

08:48.900 --> 08:50.900
And it was great.
She was great.

08:51.300 --> 08:53.300
- She's a wild woman.
- Don't tell me about that.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.500
I don't want
to know about that.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.800
- About you and grace.
- That's part of it.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.800
She had a good time.
She really did.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.400
That's what's making it
all the worse.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.500
She thinks
she committed a sin

09:02.500 --> 09:03.800
And that god's punishing her.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.600
She thinks she killed
her father.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.100
And of course,
i helped kill her father.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.000
- Did her father know?
- No, but god knew.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.800
God knows i have sex, too.
My dad's still alive.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.300
So sex and death-
The two things are not connected.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.900
Yeah, i know that
and you know that,

09:16.900 --> 09:18.600
But now that the idea's
in her head,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.100
I don't think she's ever
going to be the same.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.200
I don't know what to do.

09:21.700 --> 09:22.600
What should i do?

09:23.100 --> 09:24.600
Don't ask me.
Ask your dad.

09:24.700 --> 09:25.700
I haven't even told him yet.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.800
- It's all over the news.
- About the sex.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.200
I didn't tell him
grace and i did anything.

09:29.300 --> 09:30.900
I don't think grace
would want him to know.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.500
Could you go over there?
What am i gonna do?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.900
Talk to her.
Just talk to her. She won't talk to me.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.300
This is why i never
sleep with virgins.

09:37.300 --> 09:38.600
Just too much responsibility.

09:38.700 --> 09:39.500
You slept with amy.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.800
Yeah, and you see
what happened?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
At least you didn't
kill anybody.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.200
Snap out of it.
The two things are not related.

09:44.300 --> 09:46.500
Listen to me, do not go
to the dark side on this.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.800
Don't. If you let grace
believe the two of you

09:48.800 --> 09:51.200
Killed her father
by having sex, it's over.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.500
She'll never be the same.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.500
And it'll be over between
the two of you forever.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.400
I know that.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.600
I don't have
anyone else i can ask.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.500
I don't know, kathleen.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.200
I've never had to do
anything like this before.

10:05.300 --> 10:09.100
- I can't. I just can't.
- Oh, i- I understand.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.300
George, please.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.600
Oh, no, i wasn't
saying i wouldn't.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.200
I was just saying-

10:12.400 --> 10:13.700
Just meet him
at the airport.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.100
All right.

10:17.700 --> 10:21.300
I'll, uh, take one of the trucks
from the store.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.400
Save you a couple of bucks.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.500
Someone from the funeral home
will meet you there.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.800
They'll handle all of that.

10:26.900 --> 10:27.600
Oh, all right.

10:27.700 --> 10:29.200
- I was just trying to-
- I know.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.200
Thank you.

10:31.900 --> 10:34.000
So the funeral arrangements
have been made already?

10:34.600 --> 10:35.200
Yeah.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.500
He left a will.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.400
And he left instructions
for everything.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.100
He planned everything.

10:41.400 --> 10:45.100
Said he wanted a happy,
uplifting service celebrating his life.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.500
That's not gonna be
too easy.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.700
Especially if
there's no alcohol.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.300
It wouldn't be easy
no matter what.

10:52.000 --> 10:52.800
No, it wouldn't.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.400
But you let me know
if there's anything i can do

10:56.400 --> 10:57.500
That would make it easier.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.800
If you would just meet him.

11:00.900 --> 11:01.600
How's tom?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.300
Better than grace.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.700
I don't think she's ever going
to get over this.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.200
Oh.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.900
What am i going
to do, george?

11:14.100 --> 11:15.700
What am i going to do
without him?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.100
Marshall bowman
was the best man

11:21.400 --> 11:22.700
I have ever known.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.600
Oh, sorry.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.500
??

11:44.800 --> 11:45.300
Thank you.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.300
They're beautiful.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.600
Sorry about
the phone call last night.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.600
yeah. I just-

11:53.300 --> 11:54.500
I didn't know
how to tell you.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.400
I'm sorry. I'm not.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.100
We're gonna have a baby.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.100
- Yep.
- That's unbelievable.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.000
Yeah.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.900
Look, i really didn't
expect for this to happen,

12:06.900 --> 12:08.700
And i know
you didn't, either.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.200
You know, it kind of
took me by surprise,

12:10.200 --> 12:12.800
Especially since
we've been so careful.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.700
That's the thing about sex.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.800
Babies aren't necessarily
A thousand percent preventable.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.200
No, they're not.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.500
- So...
- so.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.300
How's the divorce coming?

12:27.000 --> 12:27.800
Slowly.

12:28.000 --> 12:28.800
Want to get married?

12:28.900 --> 12:30.100
Before i'm divorced?

12:30.700 --> 12:31.700
I think that's illegal.

12:31.800 --> 12:32.700
I don't care.

12:37.700 --> 12:38.800
You know, i won't break.

12:39.100 --> 12:39.900
I might.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.900
It's kind of scary,
isn't it?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Eh, i like scary.
We'll be fine.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.700
I'm gonna be a...daddy.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.500
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

12:49.800 --> 12:51.300
Am i okay with this?

12:52.100 --> 12:53.600
You're not, are you?

12:54.700 --> 12:56.300
No! I am.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.000
It's just, it's new.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.600
It's new for me.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.800
And it's a surprise.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.100
A big surprise.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.600
A really big, wonderful surprise.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.300
I don't know
how this happened.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.400
Doesn't matter.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.300
I love you.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.300
You've never said that
to me before.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.400
You don't have to say that
just because i'm pregnant.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.100
I feel guilty
on so many levels,

13:20.100 --> 13:21.300
I can't even tell you.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.300
I'm a grown woman.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.200
I just went through

13:23.200 --> 13:24.700
An unplanned pregnancy
with my daughter,

13:24.800 --> 13:27.300
And now i'm going through
the same thing and it's-

13:27.400 --> 13:28.800
It's not the right time
for this.

13:28.900 --> 13:29.900
This isn't fair to you.

13:29.900 --> 13:33.900
Hey, i'm not a life's-Not-Fair
Kind of guy. You know that.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.300
Life's a challenge,
but i think we're up to it.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.100
You do?

13:38.900 --> 13:39.800
I love you.

13:41.000 --> 13:41.700
Me, too.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.600
I love you, too.

13:49.000 --> 13:49.900
Grace, honey.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
You should get up.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.000
Take a shower,
clean up.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.700
It might not make you
feel better,

13:56.700 --> 13:58.100
But we have
people coming over

13:58.100 --> 14:00.400
And your friends
are gonna want to see you.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.700
I don't have any friends.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.800
Oh, yes, you do,
honey.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.700
You have a lot of friends.
You'll see.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.000
I don't want any friends.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.900
I don't deserve any friends.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.200
I killed my own father.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.000
Do you really believe that?

14:16.200 --> 14:18.000
Mom, god punishes people.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.100
Especially people
who do bad things.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.700
And what did your father do
that god is punishing him?

14:23.100 --> 14:26.800
Grace, things happen in life
That we just can't explain.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.600
But i can explain this.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.400
I committed a sin.
I had sex.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.100
And dad told me not to.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.300
He just told me not to
yesterday morning.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.500
And now he's not here
to tell me anything ever again

14:37.500 --> 14:38.500
'Cause what's the point?

14:38.800 --> 14:39.900
What's the point
in having dad here

14:39.900 --> 14:41.400
If i'm not going to do
what he tells me?

14:42.300 --> 14:44.000
So god took him away
because of me.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.900
It was an accident, grace.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.300
There are no accidents.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.100
No, there really are
no accidents.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.200
If i hadn't been
in such a hurry to have sex,

14:51.500 --> 14:53.900
Then i wouldn't have gotten into that
whole argument with him yesterday.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.000
And if i hadn't gotten
into that argument,

14:56.100 --> 14:58.400
And if i hadn't
been so determined to prove him wrong

14:58.500 --> 15:00.100
Then i wouldn't have had sex.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.900
If i hadn't had sex,
then he would still be alive.

15:03.000 --> 15:03.900
Listen to me!

15:04.500 --> 15:06.400
One has nothing
to do with the other.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.600
You didn't kill him, grace.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.000
God is not punishing you
for having sex.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.700
You are punishing you,
so stop.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.100
Stop punishing yourself.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.400
'Cause this is hard enough.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.700
This is hard enough
for me and for tom

15:20.800 --> 15:22.200
And for all of us.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.900
We have to be strong, honey.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.400
And our strength
comes from our faith.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.600
I don't know
why this happened.

15:31.900 --> 15:33.800
I don't even think
there is a why.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.200
There's not a reason, honey.
It just happened.

15:36.300 --> 15:37.800
Haven't you heard anything
that i just said?

15:37.800 --> 15:40.300
I do know why this happened
and you do, too.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.300
There is a reason.
It didn't just happen.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.800
It's not a mystery.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.000
I had sex,
and now dad is dead.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.300
And he had a horrible death
because i had incredible sex.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.400
It's just the way
life works, and death.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.600
I did this.
I did it.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.800
And if i hadn't done it,
if i hadn't had sex,

15:58.800 --> 16:00.900
And if i hadn't enjoyed
having sex so much,

16:00.900 --> 16:03.300
Then dad would still be alive,
and you know it, mom.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.900
I can babysit.
You know i could babysit.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
You don't have to come over every night
if you don't want to.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.900
I want to. And no,
you can't. You can't babysit.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.500
You've never been around
a baby before in your life.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.500
You can't even get
that veal chop into the box.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.100
Look, amy just doesn't
want to hurt your feelings,

16:23.200 --> 16:24.800
But you're not that good
at holding john.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.000
And you've yet
to change a diaper.

16:28.100 --> 16:31.700
Baby, baby, baby.
Does this look like a baby store?

16:31.800 --> 16:33.100
Are we selling babies here?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.000
Uh, baby cow. Veal chop.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.500
You got a problem with veal,
You're working in the wrong place.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.900
We may need to be off tomorrow.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.700
- Why?
- For a funeral.

16:40.900 --> 16:41.700
How do you know
when it is?

16:41.800 --> 16:42.800
What funeral?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.300
Don't tell me we have
a mutual deceased friend.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.100
It's dr. Bowman, grace's dad.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.600
She's our friend, grace.

16:48.700 --> 16:49.700
And so was he.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.300
I didn't know
you knew the bowmans.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.400
He dated grace bowman
for a short period of time.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.200
Good choice. Nice girl.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.900
The bowmans go to my church,
so we're gonna have to

16:59.000 --> 17:01.600
Flip a coin here
to decide who goes.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.200
Oh, no.
Wait a minute.

17:03.300 --> 17:06.300
I know two people who can cover
for me tomorrow afternoon.

17:07.099 --> 17:07.800
You two.

17:07.900 --> 17:09.500
But grace and i
are really close.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.200
I need to be there
to pay my respects.

17:11.300 --> 17:14.000
Dr. Marshall has been
my family pediatrician

17:14.099 --> 17:16.300
And friend for 12 years.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.200
He was a great man
and a great doctor.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.900
I- I didn't realize
you had children.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
She has three children.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.700
- How did you know that?
- I talk to her.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.599
What is going on here?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.900
Let's not get
in a fight over me.

17:27.000 --> 17:27.900
I'm taken.

17:28.099 --> 17:30.900
And i don't want to have to file
A sexual harassment claim.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.600
I see the way the two of you
look at me.

17:36.200 --> 17:36.900
Like that.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.300
Sorry. We won't look
at you like that again.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.200
But bunny, i really need
to be at the funeral.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.400
- Yeah, and so do i, so-
- No, you don't.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.900
All right, already.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.600
One of you has to cover for me
while i go to the funeral.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.400
I don't care
which one it is.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.000
Well, i do. But i'm gonna leave it
up to the two of you.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.100
All right, you stay here,
and i'll go to the funeral.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.400
I've been
through this before, okay?

17:58.500 --> 17:59.400
I lost my mother.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.200
Maybe i could be
of some help to grace.

18:01.300 --> 18:02.100
Maybe, maybe not.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.800
Come on. Ben, i'm closer
to grace than you are.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.900
I'm sorry about your mother.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.900
But that would only make this
harder for you, wouldn't it?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.800
Oh. I get it.

18:12.100 --> 18:15.200
You just want to go to the funeral
So you can console grace.

18:15.300 --> 18:15.900
What?

18:16.100 --> 18:17.200
You're just trying to get laid.

18:17.300 --> 18:20.000
I can get laid anytime i want.
You're the one who can't get laid.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.300
You know, i'd be willing
to give up going to the funeral

18:23.300 --> 18:24.300
If you could, um...

18:26.400 --> 18:27.700
could you help me
with that?

18:29.100 --> 18:31.000
okay, i've reached
a breaking point.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.100
I can't take it.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.200
I can't think about anything
Other than having sex with amy,

18:34.300 --> 18:36.400
And i'm thinking about that
20 hours a day.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.600
So you are a man.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.800
Congratulations.

18:38.900 --> 18:39.900
- Well?
- I don't know.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.200
I'll think about helping you.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.400
And you think about helping me.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.100
Learn how to change diapers
and do a few things, okay?

18:45.300 --> 18:46.600
You have no life skills.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.100
Amy won't let me change diapers.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.000
Stop with the "let."
There's no "let" in a man's language.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.000
Take initiative.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.300
That's what makes
a man a man.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.300
- Initiative.
- Okay.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.500
I'll tell amy that
i'm babysitting tonight

18:57.600 --> 18:58.900
And that you're gonna
have the night off,

18:59.000 --> 19:00.300
And that's what
you and i worked out.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.600
And if she doesn't like it,

19:01.600 --> 19:03.400
Well, then, she can
stay at home with john

19:03.400 --> 19:05.100
And i'll go over
to see grace.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.200
Now you're talkin'.

19:06.700 --> 19:09.200
Is that what people do
when someone dies?

19:09.200 --> 19:10.400
People go over to their house?

19:11.200 --> 19:13.500
That seems like the last thing
the family would want-

19:13.600 --> 19:14.800
A bunch of people over.

19:14.900 --> 19:17.000
Yeah. But the people bring food.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.500
Lots and lots of food.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.700
And somehow, that helps.

19:45.900 --> 19:46.900
Let's go, amy.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.200
I'm tired. I just want
to go and get back.

19:49.300 --> 19:52.100
It's been a long day.
You're tired?

19:52.200 --> 19:53.500
Just wait till
the baby gets here.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.500
Then you'll be tired.

19:54.900 --> 19:56.400
I know what it's like
to have a baby.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.400
- I've had two of them.
- I know that.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.300
You've probably just forgotten.
It's been a while.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.800
How'd it go with David?

20:02.100 --> 20:04.300
I think it went okay.
He's kind of excited.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.200
"Kind of"? Just kind of?

20:06.200 --> 20:07.800
Well, he's still in shock.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.600
I've had more time to think about it.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.300
Where's Ricky? We have to go.

20:11.300 --> 20:14.600
I hear you, Mom, but Ricky's not
here yet, as you can see.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.700
Well, let's just bring John
over to your dad's.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.200
I need to have a word with him anyway.

20:18.200 --> 20:22.000
Dad's not home. Ashley's home, but
she's studying for some kind of test.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.300
Where's your dad?
She shouldn't be there by herself.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.500
She likes being there by herself.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.200
I don't know where Dad is.
She wouldn't tell me.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.900
They don't tell me anything now
that you and I are living together.

20:29.900 --> 20:32.100
I was only in on their secrets
before the split.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.100
How did your father know
that I was pregnant?

20:34.700 --> 20:36.400
you look pregnant?

20:36.800 --> 20:38.500
I don't look that pregnant.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.300
Mom, you're not 15. You can't
hide a pregnancy as long as I did.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.700
Don't glamorize teen pregnancy, okay?

20:43.700 --> 20:46.100
It's not an asset to
be able to hide a pregnancy.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.600
Well, it would be in your case.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.400
So, what are you going to tell people?

20:50.900 --> 20:52.800
I think I still have time to think about it.

20:54.900 --> 20:55.800
What?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.400
I'm here to babysit.

21:05.500 --> 21:09.300
- Could we have a minute?
- One minute, yes. Five minutes, no.

21:09.700 --> 21:10.600
Thanks, Anne.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.700
When did you start calling
my mother by her first name?

21:14.700 --> 21:16.300
You always called her Mrs. Juergens.

21:16.300 --> 21:17.500
I don't know what she's going by.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.400
Is she still Mrs. Juergens, or
is she taking back her maiden name?

21:20.400 --> 21:23.200
What is her maiden name?
Or what's Mimsy's last name?

21:23.300 --> 21:25.500
Or will she be changing her
name when she gets married?

21:25.500 --> 21:27.400
She's getting married to
that David guy, right?

21:27.400 --> 21:30.400
Don't try distracting me with a bunch
of questions that no one can answer.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.300
Back to babysitting. You're not
babysitting. I told you that.

21:33.300 --> 21:34.400
I worked it out with Ricky.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.800
??

21:35.800 --> 21:37.600
You can't work it out with Ricky.
I'm the mother.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.200
He's the father, and he said I could.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.600
Yes, you can.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.900
- Let's go, Amy.
- He doesn't get to decide.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.700
Ricky doesn't get to decide.

21:44.700 --> 21:47.000
Yeah, sometimes Ricky
does get to decide.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
This evening is going to be unpleasant
enough without all the arguing.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.400
- Let's go.
- Is that a party platter?

21:53.100 --> 21:55.400
- No, it's a cheese tray.
- Mom, it's a party platter.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.600
- No, it isn't. Let's go.
- I can't go. Ben can't handle John.

21:59.700 --> 22:00.700
You can't handle him.

22:00.700 --> 22:01.600
If you could handle him,

22:01.600 --> 22:04.300
I would've accepted your offer this
morning when we talked at school.

22:04.300 --> 22:07.100
??I'm telling you now you can't handle it.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.300
I'm not comfortable leaving
just you here alone with him.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.100
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.300
Okay, if that's the way you feel,

22:12.300 --> 22:13.900
then my dad and his
girlfriend are in the car,

22:13.900 --> 22:16.100
and I'm sure they'll be happy
to come in and hang out with me.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.600
- But I am babysitting.
- No, you're not!

22:18.600 --> 22:20.100
Amy, sooner or later,

22:20.100 --> 22:23.500
this is going to work to your advantage
to have a boyfriend who wants to babysit,

22:23.500 --> 22:24.900
so just let him do it.

22:25.100 --> 22:28.800
And he doesn't need Leo and his date
to babysit him while he babysits.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.200
Ben has been here every day
since John was born.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.000
He's going to be fine.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
And if there's a problem,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.500
he can go next door to his grandpa's
and to Aunt Ashley's,

22:35.500 --> 22:38.400
not to mention the fact that we
are going to be five minutes away.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.700
So let's go! I'm leaving now.
You're leaving with me.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.100
We'll be fine-- John and me. Go.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.400
I don't mind if she makes
the decisions for her own baby,

22:51.400 --> 22:53.100
but I make the decisions for John.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.500
I make the decisions!

22:54.500 --> 22:55.700
I know you feel out of control,

22:55.700 --> 22:58.000
but sometimes other
people make the decisions.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.500
I made the decision tonight.

22:59.700 --> 23:01.500
Oh. I get it.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.000
You're trying to be the man.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I am the man.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.800
And I am the woman,
and I can make my own decisions.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.700
Amy!

23:17.000 --> 23:18.600
<i>- Hello.
- Oh, hey, Dad,</i>

23:18.600 --> 23:20.700
could you let Amy and her mother
back out of the driveway?

23:20.700 --> 23:24.100
And then maybe you and Betty could
come in just for a minute or two.

23:24.100 --> 23:26.500
All right. We'll be there.
She's just pulling out.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.800
Okay, thanks. But don't waste
any time. I think John's crying.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.800
<i>You think? You don't know?</i>

23:31.800 --> 23:33.500
<i>Well, get in there and find out.</i>

23:39.800 --> 23:41.100
Oh, good.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.500
I can't wait to see the baby.

23:44.300 --> 23:46.000
I love babies.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.300
Me, too.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.300
But I don't want to have any babies.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.700
You okay with that?

23:50.800 --> 23:52.100
You're my baby.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.100
You're the only baby I need.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.500
I feel the same way,

23:56.300 --> 23:57.200
and that's why...

23:58.000 --> 23:59.100
I got you this.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.700
Oh, my gosh! Is it real?

24:02.700 --> 24:03.600
It's real.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.100
'Cause it's okay if it's not.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.600
It's beautiful!

24:09.200 --> 24:11.100
And you're a beautiful man.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.200
- I love you, Betty.
- I love you, too, Leo.

24:14.200 --> 24:15.900
It's an engagement ring, you know.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.900
I don't care what it is.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Engagement ring, friendship ring.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.500
Or a ring-ring.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.500
Hello?

24:25.500 --> 24:27.400
What I'm trying to say is--

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
And I apologize.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.300
I wanted to take you out tonight
somewhere special, but...

24:32.600 --> 24:36.000
I'm so excited, and that kind of
thing seemed so clich? and...

24:36.000 --> 24:38.600
Well, making out with you in the car

24:38.600 --> 24:40.700
makes me feel like
I'm in high school again.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.200
me, too.

24:42.200 --> 24:45.100
And with the accident
and Dr. Bowman being killed--

24:45.400 --> 24:47.500
it's just a reminder that life is short.

24:48.300 --> 24:51.100
I want to spend whatever time
I have left with you.

24:51.300 --> 24:54.700
So, would you do me
the honor of marrying me?

24:55.400 --> 24:59.400
Yes! My answer is yes!

25:01.700 --> 25:04.200
There's only one slight complication.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.200
Okay.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.700
You know that story I told you about?

25:08.300 --> 25:12.000
The one about how I kept coming home
to that dog that wasn't so nice,

25:12.500 --> 25:14.900
the one that kept
attacking me all the time?

25:15.400 --> 25:17.900
You know, the one that
I thought might have rabies?

25:17.900 --> 25:22.000
- Yeah.
- Well, it's not rabies or a dog.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.200
It's a man,

25:24.200 --> 25:28.500
and I'm still married to him, I-I think.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.600
I mean, I haven't seen him
in many, many years,

25:30.600 --> 25:33.000
but he's the reason
that I became a court reporter.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.200
I had to support myself.

25:35.700 --> 25:40.200
Well, we'll find that dog
and we'll take care of him.

25:40.300 --> 25:43.000
Oh, Leo, you're my hero!

25:43.300 --> 25:45.800
And you know what?
If you need to take this ring back

25:46.100 --> 25:49.700
and sell it so you can use
the money to find that dog,

25:50.100 --> 25:51.800
then that's okay with me,

25:52.100 --> 25:53.800
'cause I just want to be with you.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.100
You can keep the ring.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.000
And that's a yes?

25:59.400 --> 26:00.800
That's a yes.

26:01.700 --> 26:02.800
Oh, Betty.

26:05.800 --> 26:09.800
I don't know where they are,
but it doesn't matter, John.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.000
Everyone has to change
a diaper for the first time.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.600
And I'm just grateful that
it's just me and you,

26:15.600 --> 26:18.800
so that if I screw up, then every--

26:21.500 --> 26:22.800
That's very funny.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
But as your mother might have told you,
I'm not easily discouraged.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.200
There we go.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.400
- Looks like you got it.
- Hey.

26:37.600 --> 26:40.900
Oh, you just missed it. I, uh--
I got it right in the face.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.600
That happens. You got me
a few times before I learned.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.700
Betty and I want to show you something.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.200
We're getting married.

26:53.300 --> 26:55.300
As soon as we can find my dog.

26:56.500 --> 26:57.900
Congratulations.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.200
I mean that.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.500
Welcome to the family, Betty. Hey.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.200
People are here.

27:17.300 --> 27:20.700
I don't know where
to put any more food.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.200
Help me. I need help.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.200
You can do it.

27:23.500 --> 27:26.900
- Just get Tammy to help you.
- I don't want Tammy to help me.

27:26.900 --> 27:29.000
I want my sister to help me.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.300
Well, I'm not coming out of my room.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.800
I told you, I'm never coming
out of here ever again.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.100
So I can't help you.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.600
Besides, I can't go down there
and face all those church people,

27:37.600 --> 27:38.900
not after what I did.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.400
Grace, I was wrong.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.800
You did not kill Dad.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.100
It's okay.

27:46.100 --> 27:47.600
Yeah, I did kill him.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.200
You're right.

27:50.300 --> 27:53.100
I was just trying to be nice.

27:53.100 --> 27:57.200
I'm just doing what Mom tells me to do,

27:57.400 --> 28:02.800
because we have to think of
her now, not just ourselves.

28:02.800 --> 28:06.300
You're being selfish,
and you're being stupid!

28:07.100 --> 28:10.000
You know Dad is in heaven.

28:10.200 --> 28:13.800
He's okay, even if you killed him.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.200
He is with Jesus now.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.000
Mom isn't.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.700
She is with you and me and George.

28:25.400 --> 28:28.100
I know it's hard,
but you'll get through it.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.000
Thank you for everything
today, George--

28:33.800 --> 28:37.300
for going to the airport
and for going to the funeral home

28:37.900 --> 28:39.900
and for hiding in here with me.

28:40.300 --> 28:42.100
I can't take another visitor.

28:45.300 --> 28:46.300
Hi, Anne.

28:48.300 --> 28:49.700
Hi, Kathleen.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.100
- Hi.
- How you doing?

28:51.100 --> 28:53.400
Not so good. Thanks for asking.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.400
Well, I guess you don't really need this.

28:55.900 --> 28:58.700
Oh, no, no, no. Sure we do.
Thank you for bringing it.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.800
I mean, there'll be people over
here after the funeral tomorrow,

29:00.800 --> 29:02.300
so it's always good to have a...

29:02.800 --> 29:05.000
thousand pieces of cheese.

29:05.000 --> 29:05.900
I'll take it.

29:15.000 --> 29:15.800
I didn't know.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.200
Oh, I'm not really telling people yet.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.100
I am sorry.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.700
I'm so sorry, Anne.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.700
I just wasn't expecting--

29:29.900 --> 29:32.000
That's a bad choice of words.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.000
I--

29:35.000 --> 29:37.200
I have been up--
I have been up all night.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.400
I am sorry. Please forgive me.

29:40.300 --> 29:45.700
This is totally inappropriate,
but I just can't stop.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.100
Okay?

29:49.200 --> 29:50.100
Okay.

29:53.900 --> 29:55.000
I'm sorry.

29:57.300 --> 29:58.500
So that's why I came.

29:58.500 --> 29:59.800
After all you've done for me,

29:59.800 --> 30:02.100
I just wanted to do
whatever I can do for you.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.500
Well, you can't do anything for me.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.500
Nobody can do anything for me.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.400
And I don't want you
to do anything for me.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.200
We both got what we deserved.

30:11.700 --> 30:13.600
You had sex and you got pregnant.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.300
I had sex and I killed my father.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.200
I was punished more
than you were, though, I guess,

30:17.200 --> 30:18.800
'cause I knew better than you did,

30:19.700 --> 30:21.600
and I enjoyed it more
than you enjoyed it.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.700
John is not a punishment for anything.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.700
I'm very sorry for your loss, Grace.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.700
You ever think that I might
want to tell David? Did you?

30:39.800 --> 30:42.100
You don't think at this point
you have to tell anyone, do you?

30:42.500 --> 30:44.500
- What, are you jealous?
- You know I'm not.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.600
I'm very happing living
next door to you and Amy.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.800
I'm very happy with just
Ashley and me in the house.

30:49.100 --> 30:50.400
- Thanks.
- Oh, come on, honey.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.000
You know I love you and John.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.600
I even love you.

30:53.900 --> 30:56.600
Just not like I did.
I'm over it, Anne. I'm--

30:57.200 --> 30:58.000
I'm over it.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.700
You go have a baby
with your boyfriend,

30:59.700 --> 31:01.600
and I hope the two of you
will be very happy together.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.500
And I hope that you'll
be very happy with...

31:06.200 --> 31:07.000
Never mind.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.600
I'm not even going to say it.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.500
I saw the way that
you were touching her.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
It hasn't been 24 hours.

31:15.800 --> 31:16.600
You love her.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.400
You've always loved her.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.000
Come in.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.500
- How'd you know it was me?
- How could I not know?

31:43.500 --> 31:45.900
I can see over there.
So what do you want? I'm studying.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.500
Anything I can help you with?

31:47.500 --> 31:48.500
The GED.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.300
You're too young
to take the GED, aren't you?

31:50.300 --> 31:52.300
Yeah, but I want to be ready
in case I hate high school

31:52.300 --> 31:54.000
as much as I think I'm going to.

31:54.100 --> 31:55.500
So, Ben, what do you need?

31:55.500 --> 31:57.500
Diapers. I can't find the diapers.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.700
Or maybe we're out of
diapers? I don't know.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.200
I figured you'd have some over here.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.700
Yeah. They're under the bed.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.600
- Which bed?
- Amy's bed.

32:04.600 --> 32:05.200
She keeps them there

32:05.200 --> 32:08.000
so she doesn't have to go all the way
into the baby's room during the night.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.600
I think John needs to
sleep in his own room.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.300
Is that because Ricky's in Amy's
room all the time with the baby?

32:13.800 --> 32:14.800
Yes, it is.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.300
And so you're jealous.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.900
Okay, are you jealous because
you and Amy just started having sex,

32:18.900 --> 32:21.000
or because you still haven't had sex?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.800
Ashley, that's very personal,

32:22.800 --> 32:26.200
and I don't think Amy would want me
to discuss that with you.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.300
- So you're not.
- No, we're not.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.900
I'm just asking for my dad.
He wanted me to find out for him.

32:32.700 --> 32:33.800
You left the baby!

32:33.800 --> 32:35.900
You left John all alone with
your dad and that Betty woman?

32:35.900 --> 32:37.500
Yeah, I did, and I'm sure
he's fine with them.

32:37.500 --> 32:40.300
??He's probably better off being
left with them than with me.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.900
But I left him with you.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.900
I knew I shouldn't
have left him with you.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.800
I thought you were out of diapers.
The room's slightly disorganized.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.300
Big deal. I don't exactly have time
to do a lot of housekeeping.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.300
And I'm not out of diapers.
They're under my bed.

32:53.300 --> 32:54.700
I know that. Ashley told me that.

32:54.700 --> 32:57.100
I just thought you were out of diapers,
and that's why I came over here.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.200
I don't even know
that woman-- that Betty.

32:59.300 --> 33:00.500
And she looks like a hooker.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.200
Yeah, well, I might be
getting a hooker soon

33:02.200 --> 33:04.800
if we don't have some sort of
contact in the near future.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
You are being a little
too pushy here, Ben.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.600
Pushy? We made out more
when you were pregnant.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.800
Yeah. Because if we'd had sex
when I was pregnant,

33:11.800 --> 33:13.900
I couldn't get pregnant
on top of being pregnant.

33:13.900 --> 33:15.900
But now that I'm not pregnant and
now that I've been through childbirth,

33:15.900 --> 33:19.000
believe me, Ben, I will not be having
sex for a very, very long time.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.100
That's all you think about-- sex.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.600
'Cause you have nothing else to do.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.400
And when you do have
something to do, like babysit,

33:24.400 --> 33:26.200
you bail and come over here
to hang out with Ashley.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.300
- Let's go.
- One second.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.200
Kiss me, Amy.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.800
- Ben...
- Kiss me.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.800
Just one kiss.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.300
I'm sorry.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.500
I've missed that.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.000
I've missed kissing you.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.800
But I don't want to do
anything more than kiss.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.400
And if you want more than that, Ben,

34:08.400 --> 34:10.400
then you're going to
have to go somewhere else.

34:10.900 --> 34:12.100
Because I can't.

34:12.699 --> 34:15.500
I-- I just can't. And I don't want to.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.000
Oh, man!

34:28.699 --> 34:30.100
Oh, that was...

34:30.100 --> 34:32.300
- Yeah.
- Oh, I needed that.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.800
I've been thinking about death all day.

34:38.500 --> 34:41.199
Wow, I still can't
believe Dr. Bowman's--

34:42.800 --> 34:44.400
...not with us anymore.

34:44.800 --> 34:45.600
Yeah.

34:46.300 --> 34:47.699
He was a nice guy.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.600
He was good at talking
to people, even me.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.100
She thinks she killed him.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.800
Grace.

34:55.500 --> 34:58.500
She thinks when she and Jack
had sex, that she killed him.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.500
I know. Jack told me.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.100
But she'll get past that,
don't you think?

35:03.500 --> 35:04.500
I don't know.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.000
I don't know if she'll
get past it any time soon.

35:07.500 --> 35:10.600
- I told her not to do it.
- Yeah, I know.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.200
But now you gotta tell her
it's okay that she did do it.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.700
You have to convince her.

35:14.700 --> 35:17.600
- She won't even talk to me.
- She's got to talk to someone.

35:19.300 --> 35:20.500
Well, maybe you should talk to her.

35:20.500 --> 35:24.700
No. This is your area of expertise--
not having any guilt about sex.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.100
You take this one.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.900
Well, are you going to the funeral?

35:28.900 --> 35:32.400
Yeah. I know Amy wants to go,
but she got to go over there tonight.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.000
No, you should go.

35:34.100 --> 35:36.600
You knew him better than Amy,
and I want you there with me.

35:36.800 --> 35:37.700
I'll try.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.100
Don't forget. I got a kid now.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.600
Jeez, I still can't believe it.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.600
I'm tired. I don't know
how people do it.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.100
How does anyone have sex
and have a baby?

35:47.100 --> 35:48.800
Yeah, well, I'm sure I wouldn't know.

35:48.800 --> 35:52.600
- Oh, come here. Don't get jealous.
- I can't help it. I am jealous.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.600
I'm jealous that you
spend so much time with Amy.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.900
With John, not Amy.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.400
You know her mom's pregnant?

35:59.000 --> 36:00.600
- What?
- Yeah.

36:00.900 --> 36:02.100
She and George?

36:03.200 --> 36:04.000
Who?

36:04.200 --> 36:05.000
Me.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.700
Come on. I don't know.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.200
I think she has a boyfriend.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.800
And I thought
my family was messed up.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.000
What? What do you want?

36:21.000 --> 36:22.100
Go inside.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.800
I want to talk to Ricky, again.

36:25.300 --> 36:27.500
- Why?
- I said go inside.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.500
Good night. I had a nice time.

36:32.900 --> 36:33.900
See you at school.

36:39.100 --> 36:40.000
Hey, I'm home.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.100
Been a busy night.
Ben dropped over, then Amy.

36:43.300 --> 36:46.300
Then they had a big fight
about not having sex.

36:46.300 --> 36:48.700
- So they're not having sex?
- Nope. I asked him.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.600
All right. Thanks.

36:50.900 --> 36:52.600
It's just she's looking like
she's having sex.

36:52.600 --> 36:53.800
I don't know what that's about.

36:53.900 --> 36:56.300
That's just her thinking
that she's a woman now.

36:56.300 --> 36:59.200
Well, as long as she's a woman
not having sex, I'm okay with that.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.200
- Bad day?
- Yeah.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.300
I've been doing awful stuff for Kathleen.

37:03.500 --> 37:04.900
I had to identify the body.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.100
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You know, Ash--

37:08.300 --> 37:09.600
...life is short.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.600
We should enjoy it.

37:12.900 --> 37:16.600
I feel like buying a big RV and hanging
the Harley off the back of it,

37:16.600 --> 37:17.700
and the two of us
just taking off, you know?

37:17.700 --> 37:19.000
Driving across the country.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.800
We'll get a dog. We can bring the dog.

37:20.800 --> 37:25.200
Now that we're free,
we should act free, be free.

37:25.300 --> 37:27.200
Did you see Mom
over at the Bowmans'?

37:28.300 --> 37:29.200
Yep.

37:32.300 --> 37:33.200
Dad,

37:34.100 --> 37:35.200
I'm so sorry...

37:35.600 --> 37:36.700
about the baby,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.200
about Mom and David and the baby.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.800
You sure there's no chance
that it's your baby?

37:40.800 --> 37:42.100
No. No.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.000
Your mom had me fixed.
You know that.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.100
Okay. And, uh,

37:46.100 --> 37:48.400
did she go with you
when you were fixed?

37:48.400 --> 37:50.800
I don't remember.
It was very traumatic.

37:51.300 --> 37:52.600
You're doing that thing.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.400
- What thing?
- That--

37:54.400 --> 37:56.700
That thing that you do with
your mouth when you're lying.

37:56.700 --> 38:00.000
- What are you talking about?
- Did you, or did you not get fixed?

38:00.500 --> 38:01.500
See? You did it again!

38:01.500 --> 38:03.100
Well, it's 'cause you're
making me self-conscious!

38:03.100 --> 38:05.200
Oh, Dad. Please no.

38:05.800 --> 38:06.700
No.

38:11.500 --> 38:12.600
Okay.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.200
Here are the boundaries:

38:14.400 --> 38:16.000
He can come over when I'm not here,

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
but not weeknights, no school nights.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.900
You should be studying
and so should he.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.000
And no drinking, no drugs.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.600
I don't drink or do drugs.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.900
I like that about you, Adrian. I do.

38:28.700 --> 38:29.500
But tell me.

38:29.700 --> 38:32.200
How is it you never got
into drinking and drugs, hmm?

38:32.200 --> 38:33.600
What kept you from doing that?

38:34.900 --> 38:39.800
Well, I always thought that
one day I would meet my father,

38:39.800 --> 38:42.300
and we would have
a conversation like this,

38:42.300 --> 38:45.600
and, well, he would ask me
if I drink or do drugs,

38:45.900 --> 38:48.500
and I wanted to be able to
look him right in the eye

38:48.500 --> 38:50.700
and say, "No, I don't."

38:50.700 --> 38:53.500
No drinking, no drugs and no lying.

38:53.500 --> 38:54.500
I'm not lying.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.400
Not about the drinking and drugs.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.400
I got a feeling
the story wasn't quite true.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.900
Okay, one, I don't have money
to buy alcohol or drugs,

39:02.000 --> 39:03.900
not even the cheapest alcohol or drugs.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.700
I'd rather have new clothes
if I had any money to spend.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.300
Or makeup.

39:08.900 --> 39:10.200
Yeah, I like makeup.

39:10.300 --> 39:15.500
And two, I like to be
stone-cold sober when I have sex.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.400
I don't want to make any mistakes,

39:17.400 --> 39:21.500
I don't want to make any bad choices
or forget to take care of myself.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.000
- Too much information?
- No, no.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.500
It's just that, um,

39:28.000 --> 39:29.900
we're still new
at this dad-daughter thing,

39:29.900 --> 39:32.300
and these conversations
aren't easy for me.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.200
But these are things
we need to talk about.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.900
You and Ricky
having sex in the house...

39:39.300 --> 39:41.300
Maybe the car wasn't the worst idea.

39:42.700 --> 39:43.800
That was a joke.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.000
I'm just really uncomfortable with
your having sex with your boyfriend

39:49.000 --> 39:50.800
in the house when I'm in the house.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.400
So, here's the thing:

39:52.400 --> 39:54.100
I know I'm not divorced yet,

39:54.200 --> 39:59.200
but I was wondering what you would think
if I asked your mother if it'd be okay

39:59.200 --> 40:02.400
if the three of us got a house together.

40:02.500 --> 40:06.700
And she can rent this place
out until we see how it goes.

40:06.900 --> 40:07.900
A house?

40:08.700 --> 40:11.400
R-Really? We could move to a house?

40:11.400 --> 40:13.400
Well, we have to ask your mom, but--

40:14.000 --> 40:15.600
Thank you, Dad! Thank you!

40:15.600 --> 40:18.100
Thank you for even
trying to make us a family!

40:18.100 --> 40:19.500
thank you, thank you!

40:20.700 --> 40:23.800
With being a family, there are
going to be some boundaries.

40:24.600 --> 40:28.000
But a house will give us
a little bit more privacy

40:28.500 --> 40:31.300
and, at the same time, it'll
give us a place to be together.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
I love you.

40:33.500 --> 40:34.700
I love you, too, Adrian.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.200
You're not even going
to look at me, Grace?

40:44.600 --> 40:46.400
I'm sorry about your dad,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.900
but you know it
had nothing to do with us.

40:54.100 --> 40:57.100
Grace, I am so sorry.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.100
And I know it's a shock,

41:00.100 --> 41:02.100
and I feel terrible
for you and your family,

41:02.100 --> 41:03.700
but we didn't do it.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.900
He didn't die
because you and I had sex.

41:06.900 --> 41:08.300
Yes, he did.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.500
Don't.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.900
Don't pull away from me now, Grace.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.300
I love you.

41:22.800 --> 41:24.100
I've always loved you.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Well, just stop loving me, okay?

41:29.600 --> 41:32.600
I don't want you to love me,
and I don't love you anymore,

41:32.900 --> 41:35.900
and I'm never, ever going to
have sex with you again.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.200
So why don't you just
go to Adrian or Shawna

41:38.200 --> 41:40.700
or all the other girls you had sex
with that I don't know about!

41:40.700 --> 41:42.609
Go have sex with them!

41:42.610 --> 41:47.184
