01:18.112 --> 01:20.941
Have you ever wondered
how it all gets done?

01:21.274 --> 01:24.186
How Santa gets in and
out of millions of homes

01:24.228 --> 01:26.474
all in one night?

01:26.516 --> 01:29.761
Let's just say, he
has a little help.

01:35.710 --> 01:38.165
The operation has
its challenges...

01:41.036 --> 01:44.074
but we're always prepared.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.934
Our mission statement...

01:53.975 --> 01:57.969
get in, get out,
never be noticed.

02:02.962 --> 02:05.084
I'm part of Prep & Landing...

02:05.125 --> 02:08.745
an elite unit of elves,
getting houses around the world

02:08.787 --> 02:11.325
ready for the
big guy's arrival.

02:20.187 --> 02:23.681
The name's Wayne. Call
sign: Little Drummer Boy.

02:24.430 --> 02:27.717
And I've been doing
this a long time.

02:29.672 --> 02:32.752
A really long time.

02:35.165 --> 02:38.617
Now I'm ready to move up
and leave this job behind.

02:40.740 --> 02:43.485
Oh, yeah. Next year's
gonna be different.

02:56.550 --> 03:00.044
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Excuse me.
This spot is reserved for...

03:00.252 --> 03:01.792
Wayne?

03:01.792 --> 03:03.664
Ah, ah, ah! No ticket
this time, Waterkotte.

03:03.664 --> 03:06.077
You received the promotion?
I was not informed of this!

03:06.119 --> 03:07.907
I'm just heading over to
Magee's office right now...

03:07.907 --> 03:10.404
You know, make it official.
blah, blah, blah...

03:10.487 --> 03:13.233
You just make sure you get a parking
sticker on there pronto, mister!

03:13.275 --> 03:16.811
Hey, hey, hey. Scratch it, I'll
put you on the Naughty List.

03:16.852 --> 03:19.598
Just kidding... but I could.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.469
All Prep & Landing
teams report in.

03:22.511 --> 03:24.882
Oh, Jingle Bells,
Wayne is swell,

03:24.924 --> 03:27.046
he's a director...

03:27.088 --> 03:32.663
Don't be late for our
date under the mistletoe...

03:33.162 --> 03:35.991
Hey, Wayne, we're gonna miss you!
-I'll miss you, Gabe.

03:36.033 --> 03:37.447
It's Bryan!

03:37.447 --> 03:40.318
Naughty List houses
coming online now.

03:40.983 --> 03:43.272
All coal elves check in.

03:43.314 --> 03:44.895
Oh, here he comes.
Here he comes.

03:44.895 --> 03:47.806
Hey, new boss.
-Hey, boss!

03:47.848 --> 03:49.721
My wife, she made
you fruit cake.

03:49.721 --> 03:52.258
Why, thank you! Whoa, heavy!

03:52.799 --> 03:55.545
Feels more like
a pound cake, huh?

03:59.955 --> 04:01.370
What was your name again?

04:01.370 --> 04:04.033
Gristletoe Joe, sir. But
my friends call me Nancy.

04:04.074 --> 04:06.613
I'm gonna remember you
when I'm in charge, Nance.

04:06.654 --> 04:08.859
Now you tell that
lovely wife of yours

04:08.859 --> 04:11.064
that I am gonna savor
every last bite. Yeah.

04:12.895 --> 04:14.808
From me to you.
-Hold on. Hello?

04:14.850 --> 04:18.137
I'll see you at the
Christmas party tomorrow.

04:18.178 --> 04:20.591
Hey, Magee.
-Hello?... Oh, yeah?

04:20.632 --> 04:22.423
Well, this year I'm
Santa's secret Santa.

04:22.423 --> 04:24.336
What am I supposed to
do about that, Jerry?

04:24.877 --> 04:26.791
Hi, Wayne.

04:27.124 --> 04:30.785
Aw, did you lose a bet, sweety?
-It's my celebration tie.

04:30.827 --> 04:33.739
Wayne... you didn't
get the promotion.

04:34.654 --> 04:36.402
What?
-Peterson got it.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.732
My... partner?
-Yeah.

04:39.355 --> 04:41.977
So, ah, no parking sticker?

04:45.222 --> 04:50.506
You're disappointed!
-Oh, no, no! I'm glad for Peterson.

04:50.548 --> 04:53.668
What, are you crazy?
'Cause he was trained by me.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.955
I mean, seriously, are
you crazy? I'm so glad...

04:56.997 --> 05:01.115
that the big guy noticed him...
and not me. So there you go.

05:01.156 --> 05:04.527
Well, good! Because now you
have a new partner to train!

05:04.568 --> 05:06.440
Ah, Tiny? Tiny? Ah, Tiny!

05:06.440 --> 05:07.939
Send him in.

05:07.980 --> 05:12.931
I think you'll really like him.
Top of his class at Kringle Academy.

05:15.635 --> 05:18.714
Ah, a little help here.
-It was a small class.

05:19.837 --> 05:22.356
Please!

05:25.526 --> 05:28.571
I'm Lanny. Call
sign: Tree Skirt.

05:28.612 --> 05:31.031
I'm so excited to
be working with you.

05:31.073 --> 05:32.992
I had a poster of you
on my wall growing up!

05:33.033 --> 05:35.995
Talk about a
Christmas gift, huh?!

05:36.036 --> 05:40.583
Okay! Thrasher is the last
transport, so let's get a move on.

05:40.624 --> 05:43.127
Thrasher? Thrasher,
the reindeer?

05:44.962 --> 05:47.381
Oh, there he is!
Great garland!

05:47.423 --> 05:50.926
I heard Dasher had a cousin, but
I always thought you were a myth!

05:50.968 --> 05:53.012
I am a myth.
-What?

05:53.053 --> 05:57.099
Tell anyone I exist,
and you won't exist.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.354
Wayne, what's
Thrasher's top speed?

06:02.354 --> 06:05.733
Mach 2? Mach 3? I bet it's
more like Mach-a-billion!

06:05.774 --> 06:07.526
This is so tinsel!

06:07.526 --> 06:11.363
Does the phrase, "Silent
Night" mean anything to you?

06:12.615 --> 06:16.493
3, 2, 1...

06:28.422 --> 06:32.218
Wow, that house is
a winter wonderland.

06:51.195 --> 06:53.113
We have an L-shaped
living chamber.

06:53.656 --> 06:56.408
Two visible exits
to the north,

06:56.408 --> 06:58.410
and to the east.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.914
No hidden cameras.

07:03.290 --> 07:07.169
Hey, you know, it seems like you've
got this really holiday... zest going.

07:07.211 --> 07:09.296
You -You know what?
What do you say you fly solo?

07:09.338 --> 07:11.340
Solo? "Solo".

07:11.382 --> 07:17.137
But, it's m-m-m-my first mission.
-You are highly trained, aren't you?

07:17.179 --> 07:19.598
I'll report in at
regular intervals.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.226
I'm going upstairs.

07:22.268 --> 07:26.188
Right. And I'll handle
cookie assessment.

07:33.779 --> 07:35.614
Tree Skirt to
Little Drummer Boy.

07:35.614 --> 07:38.742
No creatures stirring. Over!

07:49.545 --> 07:52.548
Stockings are hung with care.

07:52.590 --> 07:56.218
Am I doing okay?
-Ah, doing fantastic!

07:57.803 --> 08:00.681
That's right.
I'm being naughty.

08:01.515 --> 08:04.602
Tell your buddy Peterson
to put me on his list.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.647
Oh, a bike!

08:08.689 --> 08:11.525
Oh, he's gonna be so happy!

08:19.992 --> 08:24.997
Merry Christmas!
-A Christmas special! That's nice.

08:24.997 --> 08:27.875
Do you wanna watch a
Christmas special? You do?

08:29.460 --> 08:32.880
Oops! Oh, another one?
Do you like that? I don't.

08:32.922 --> 08:35.216
That one? Too bad.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.967
Ah, here we go.

08:46.268 --> 08:48.354
Ah, Little Drummer Boy...

08:49.146 --> 08:51.523
Ah, I could really
use some advice here.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.776
Go with your gut, kid.

09:01.283 --> 09:04.662
Merry Christmas, big guy!

09:06.789 --> 09:08.749
Stale.

09:25.975 --> 09:27.685
It's Jingle Time!

09:27.685 --> 09:29.979
Open hangar doors.

09:34.358 --> 09:37.069
Doors open.
-Cue Rosebud.

09:46.745 --> 09:48.539
Instruments are holly jolly.

09:48.539 --> 09:50.499
Rev up the engines.

09:58.132 --> 09:59.633
Reindeer ready to roll.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.802
We are go for partridge.

10:04.513 --> 10:07.057
He's on his way. I've
made the list, sir.

10:07.057 --> 10:09.768
You checked it twice?
-Per redundancy protocol.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.478
Prep & Landing
teams are under way.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.772
Everything seems to be in proper order.
-Excellent!

10:13.814 --> 10:15.399
Thank you, Miss Holly.

10:15.399 --> 10:18.027
The partridge is in the pear
tree. We are go for launch.

10:18.068 --> 10:19.695
Vehicle?
-Dash away.

10:19.695 --> 10:21.155
Engines?
-Dash away.

10:21.155 --> 10:23.073
Partridge?
-Dash away.

10:25.409 --> 10:27.286
Dash away all!

10:27.328 --> 10:30.873
10, 9, 8, 7...

10:30.998 --> 10:36.712
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

10:37.254 --> 10:41.342
Ho, Ho... Go!

10:52.394 --> 10:54.188
Okay, people, this is it!

10:54.188 --> 10:58.067
364 days of preparation, one
night of perfect execution.

11:00.361 --> 11:02.488
Nothing will go wrong. Nothing
will go wrong. Nothing will...

11:02.530 --> 11:05.032
Sir, there's a storm
alert over Sector 7.

11:05.366 --> 11:07.284
Oh... frostbite!

11:08.077 --> 11:11.163
Hi, I'm Timmy.
What's your name?

11:11.163 --> 11:13.332
I-I-I,
ah...

11:13.832 --> 11:15.292
I-It's Wayne.

11:15.292 --> 11:18.003
You're a lot smaller than
Santa's helpers at the mall.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.922
Are you a baby elf?

11:19.922 --> 11:22.132
No, I'm not a baby!
I have a pension!

11:23.133 --> 11:24.593
You're squeezy.

11:24.593 --> 11:26.637
Little Drummer Boy,
creature stirring!

11:26.845 --> 11:28.973
Another one!

11:32.893 --> 11:35.729
Security breach. Subject
has been sparkled.

11:36.522 --> 11:39.233
Hey, is this one of
the big guy's cookies?

11:39.275 --> 11:40.693
Not anymore.

11:40.693 --> 11:43.028
Oh, we're definitely
behind schedule now!

11:43.070 --> 11:44.488
Then we better get going.

11:44.488 --> 11:46.991
But... but doesn't
section code 808 state:

11:46.991 --> 11:49.493
"All children shall
be snug in their beds"?

11:52.913 --> 11:56.000
So you were having a
jolly holiday downstairs.

11:56.041 --> 11:58.919
Oh, yeah. Fa la la la la!

11:58.919 --> 12:01.338
What's wrong?
Don't you even care?

12:01.463 --> 12:05.509
I've been working Prep
& Landing for 227 years,

12:05.509 --> 12:08.262
and believe me,
the thrill is gone.

12:08.304 --> 12:12.016
But this the most tinsel job ever.
I mean, bringing joy to children?

12:12.057 --> 12:14.476
Sorry.
-Look, Tree Skirt.

12:14.476 --> 12:18.022
We are just tiny ornaments
on some gigantic tree...

12:18.063 --> 12:21.233
slaving away... all for what?

12:21.275 --> 12:23.944
"For what"? For him.

12:24.570 --> 12:29.283
Just look at this face, Wayne. Imagine
the joy on this face tomorrow morning.

12:29.325 --> 12:31.952
Imagine all the great
memories he'll pass

12:31.952 --> 12:34.538
onto his children, and
his children's children.

12:35.623 --> 12:38.292
The thrill may be
gone for you, Wayne,

12:38.918 --> 12:41.795
but it's not gone for him.

12:43.088 --> 12:45.007
You'll learn, rookie.

12:45.883 --> 12:49.553
I thought you were "the"
Prep & Landing guy, Wayne...

12:50.095 --> 12:52.765
but you're just
a lump of coal.

12:53.724 --> 12:57.645
Yeah, well... sometimes
we don't get what we want.

13:04.485 --> 13:06.695
Yes, dear?
-Wayne, it's Magee.

13:06.737 --> 13:09.073
I'm sure you've noticed,
the snowstorm is pretty bad.

13:09.114 --> 13:11.659
Oh, well I have now.
I mean, uh, oh...

13:11.700 --> 13:13.327
What do you mean?
You-you-you-you're not

13:13.327 --> 13:14.995
on the roof? You're...
you're not done?

13:15.037 --> 13:18.749
Oh, okay. Fine. We have
a coal in the stocking.

13:18.749 --> 13:20.793
What?
-We're putting him to bed.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.711
Relax.
-I told you to pull it together,

13:22.711 --> 13:24.463
not crumble like
a Christmas cookie!

13:24.463 --> 13:26.590
If you have...
-8 maids a-milking, this is Jingle Bell.

13:26.632 --> 13:28.175
Come in, 8 maids a-milking.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.053
I really hate that call sign.
-Can barely hear you, Jingle Bell.

13:31.095 --> 13:33.973
We are in the soup here.
-We're flying blind, man!

13:34.014 --> 13:36.100
Tell her we're flying blind!

13:36.141 --> 13:38.269
Why didn't I
listen to Jerry...

13:38.269 --> 13:40.187
and stay in toy design?

13:40.896 --> 13:44.191
Tiny, bring me Big Red.

13:48.696 --> 13:51.699
It's just a little snow,
Magee. I can handle it.

13:51.740 --> 13:54.159
You don't understand, sir.
The site's not prepped.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.120
We have no choice...

13:56.787 --> 13:58.706
Figgy Pudding.

13:59.331 --> 14:02.543
It's never come to
that. What about Timmy?

14:02.543 --> 14:04.253
Sir, with all due respect,

14:04.253 --> 14:07.131
there are millions of other kids
counting on you. It's just not safe.

14:07.172 --> 14:09.675
We'll make it up to
Timmy somehow, I promise.

14:10.593 --> 14:12.678
All right then.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.680
You heard her team.

14:22.771 --> 14:25.232
Figgy p-pudding?

14:25.274 --> 14:28.277
B-b-b-but that means the
big guy's passing us by.

14:28.319 --> 14:31.155
What about Timmy? What
about his Christmas?

14:33.324 --> 14:37.369
Well, I, uh,
never meant for...

14:37.411 --> 14:39.663
this to happen.

14:41.707 --> 14:45.836
This will be the
best Christmas ever.

14:49.798 --> 14:52.426
Thanks, Wayne.

15:09.568 --> 15:12.488
Magee, patch me through to the big guy.
-Wayne, it's over.

15:12.530 --> 15:15.324
Patch me through or I'll tell
everyone about you and Tiny!

15:15.366 --> 15:18.452
Patching you through.
-Hello? This is Partridge.

15:18.494 --> 15:20.746
Sir, my name's Wayne
from Prep & Landing.

15:22.373 --> 15:24.375
I need you to come
to this house, sir.

15:24.416 --> 15:26.710
Oh, I'm afraid Magee's
rerouting me, son.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.921
Sir, there's a child here
that's really excited for you.

15:28.921 --> 15:31.715
We cannot let him down.
I can land you safely.

15:31.757 --> 15:34.051
I have a plan,
and there is time.

15:34.093 --> 15:36.095
Please, sir, let me do my job.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.972
I can't let Timmy down.

15:37.972 --> 15:42.059
I was hoping you'd say that.
Let's give it a shot, my boy.

15:46.230 --> 15:49.817
This is the most tinsel
job ever, huh, partner?

15:51.485 --> 15:53.737
I should never have
patched him through.

15:54.446 --> 15:56.323
Sir!

15:56.532 --> 15:59.410
Roasting chestnuts!
He's turned back!

16:04.999 --> 16:07.084
Oh, no!

16:08.127 --> 16:10.004
No!

16:15.843 --> 16:18.470
You can't see
anything in this storm!

16:18.470 --> 16:20.806
Except your winter wonderland.

16:36.071 --> 16:38.490
How are we gonna make
it through all this snow?

16:38.532 --> 16:42.328
Laughing all the way, my
friend. Laughing all the way.

16:47.958 --> 16:50.502
Lanny! I need some rope!

17:02.056 --> 17:03.974
Is this enough?

17:12.233 --> 17:14.151
Light 'em up!

17:25.788 --> 17:27.705
Good job, Tree Skirt!

17:27.748 --> 17:29.625
Yes!

17:36.298 --> 17:38.551
I'm gonna die!

17:39.426 --> 17:41.303
I'm alive!

17:53.524 --> 17:56.861
Little Drummer Boy, Little Drummer
Boy. We don't see the landing strip.

17:56.861 --> 17:58.779
Almost there, sir.

18:05.744 --> 18:07.538
We have a visual.

18:07.538 --> 18:09.206
The landing zone is prepped.

18:09.206 --> 18:11.333
We're going in.
Cut the engines.

18:16.547 --> 18:18.048
Come in too hot!

18:18.048 --> 18:21.468
It's too late to pull up,
man! It's too late to pull up!

18:21.510 --> 18:23.053
Keep it together, Dancer!

18:23.053 --> 18:24.972
Hang on!

18:27.600 --> 18:29.476
The tail hook!

19:09.725 --> 19:13.479
Um, hi. I-I don't have an appointment,
uh, but I-I was wondering if, um...

19:13.520 --> 19:16.065
Go right in. He's been expecting you.
-He is?

19:17.441 --> 19:19.360
Oh, well, uh... Okay.

19:19.693 --> 19:22.071
Hey, Wayne. You're
missing the party!

19:22.112 --> 19:24.657
They're gonna start
the gift exchange!

19:24.698 --> 19:28.285
No, no. You-You... You go
ahead. I'll catch up later.

19:39.171 --> 19:40.589
Come in, Wayne.

19:40.589 --> 19:44.468
Sir, I am very sorry
about last night.

19:45.094 --> 19:48.472
If you wanna transfer
me, or fire me, I...

19:48.806 --> 19:51.267
...I completely understand.

19:52.226 --> 19:56.230
But, please... make sure
you find Lanny a new partner.

19:56.230 --> 19:58.774
He's a good elf, sir.

19:59.358 --> 20:04.405
Well, uh... that's why
I assigned him to you.

20:05.072 --> 20:09.535
But, don't be silly, Wayne. I'm
not gonna bite your head off.

20:09.577 --> 20:13.455
Everyone slips onto the
naughty list once in a while.

20:13.497 --> 20:15.791
I'm glad you
stopped by though...

20:15.833 --> 20:19.837
so I could say...
Merry Christmas.

20:19.879 --> 20:21.922
It's... It's Timmy's house!

20:21.922 --> 20:26.969
It's a reminder of why
our job is so important.

20:27.011 --> 20:31.015
Now go on. We're not getting
any younger, you know.

20:37.229 --> 20:39.565
Thanks... Santa.

20:39.607 --> 20:42.860
Oh, Wayne... one more thing.

20:45.988 --> 20:48.490
Well? Wha
-What did he say?

20:48.532 --> 20:51.202
He offered me a promotion.
-Wow!

20:51.243 --> 20:53.871
Director of the Nice List.

20:53.913 --> 20:56.332
Congratulations!

20:56.373 --> 20:59.418
I turned him down.
-What?

20:59.919 --> 21:02.880
I'm more of a
Prep & Landing guy.

21:12.765 --> 21:14.683
Oh! Fruit cake?!

21:15.684 --> 21:19.271
Thanks, Magee!
Best Christmas ever!
