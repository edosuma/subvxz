WEBVTT

00:19.216 --> 00:20.537
I don't, uh...

00:21.400 --> 00:22.860
I don't think I can do it.

00:24.159 --> 00:26.950
Oh, sure you can.

00:26.951 --> 00:31.397
It's easy.
Besides, I do all the work.

00:32.542 --> 00:34.184
Watch.

00:57.317 --> 01:00.115
Excuse me.
Two margaritas, please.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.796
Cute shoes !

01:11.797 --> 01:14.702
- Ocean Boulevard.
- The best sales.

01:16.216 --> 01:17.703
Hey. Where're those drinks ?

01:17.774 --> 01:20.973
Oh, so impatient. This is
my dear friend, Robert.

01:20.974 --> 01:23.170
He and I were college roommates.
And now, he's

01:23.171 --> 01:28.624
a big-time financier from DC working
on some big deal that's way over my head.

01:28.688 --> 01:29.817
She's playing dumb.

01:29.898 --> 01:32.017
Truth is, she's smarter
than any man in here.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.915
I'd like to hear about your deal.

01:33.916 --> 01:34.754
Really ?

01:34.755 --> 01:39.800
I-I mean, cool. I've got some, uh,
Cristal chilling, if you want...

01:51.028 --> 01:54.717
This should cover
anything else he orders.

01:58.515 --> 02:01.262
Bed seven's covered. Got it.

02:10.815 --> 02:12.278
Kim Burton.

02:12.363 --> 02:15.949
Poor baby.
She left a beautiful corpse.

02:16.077 --> 02:17.634
Aside from the petechiae.

02:17.635 --> 02:19.209
Asphyxiation.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.640
She was strangled ?

02:20.641 --> 02:24.030
No marks.
My money's on smothering.

02:24.218 --> 02:27.701
She put up a fight.
Couple of broken nails.

02:27.984 --> 02:29.053
Time of death ?

02:29.054 --> 02:31.553
No stiffness in the extremities.

02:31.656 --> 02:34.205
She's fresh. A couple hours ago.

02:34.206 --> 02:38.211
Okay, so that puts it at
about 3:00 or 4:00 A.M., right ?

02:39.284 --> 02:41.730
All these sheers, and
no one saw the murder ?

02:41.731 --> 02:46.413
It being a place like this, sex and
murder might be indistinguishable.

03:44.021 --> 03:45.424
CSI Duquesne.

03:45.787 --> 03:47.232
CSI Delko.

03:49.615 --> 03:50.949
That's not going to work.

03:55.435 --> 03:56.890
Badge must've come loose.

03:56.891 --> 03:58.438
Check your vehicle ;
I'll still be here.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.568
I can vouch for him.

03:59.569 --> 04:02.299
Okay, but it's on you
if this comes back to bite me.

04:06.511 --> 04:08.403
Eric, losing a badge is major.

04:08.404 --> 04:09.764
Yeah, I know.

04:09.765 --> 04:11.569
When was the last time you had it ?

04:11.570 --> 04:13.034
Last night ; I went out.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.618
Can you call her,
see if she found it ?

04:14.619 --> 04:16.535
I would if I knew her name.

04:18.111 --> 04:22.990
Look, I was... toothing. I got a hookup,
and I met a girl in a parking lot.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.246
"Toothing" ?
Random anonymous sex ?

04:25.247 --> 04:26.710
You going to tell me something ?

04:26.711 --> 04:28.653
Besides "wear protection" ?

04:28.961 --> 04:30.334
Yeah. Retrace your footsteps.

04:30.335 --> 04:32.715
See if you can find your badge
before you get another callout.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.605
Uh, what about the crime scene ?

04:34.847 --> 04:36.446
Ryan's here.

04:36.494 --> 04:38.564
All right. Thanks.

04:41.829 --> 04:43.155
Delko get another case ?

04:43.156 --> 04:44.515
Yeah, kind of.

04:54.502 --> 04:58.549
According to our bartender, our victim,
uh, booked a bed around 1:00 A.M.

04:58.550 --> 05:00.531
Dropped about five large last night.

05:00.532 --> 05:01.265
She paid ?

05:01.266 --> 05:04.305
And not just for herself. She bought
drinks for a bunch of people.

05:05.989 --> 05:08.157
That's because she was working.

05:08.403 --> 05:10.601
Did you, uh, know Kim, Miss... ?

05:10.602 --> 05:12.525
Gabrielle Marinelli.

05:12.526 --> 05:16.187
I've seen her out.
Um, I think she's a pro.

05:16.188 --> 05:16.922
A prostitute ?

05:16.923 --> 05:18.422
More like a madam.

05:18.423 --> 05:19.643
I'm going to need your statement.

05:19.644 --> 05:22.654
Look, I'm a teacher. I don't want to
get caught in the middle of something.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.665
We'll be as discreet as possible.

05:24.841 --> 05:26.617
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Tripp.

05:48.681 --> 05:49.842
Biological ?

05:53.269 --> 05:54.404
Salty.

05:55.089 --> 05:58.606
- I'm not going to say anything.
- As in margarita salty.

05:58.607 --> 06:01.892
The vic must have spilled her drink.
I don't see any other stains.

06:04.599 --> 06:08.120
Ooh ! It's odd for a bed,
especially in a place like this.

06:28.029 --> 06:29.500
It's a death mask.

06:29.501 --> 06:31.776
Pillow as murder weapon.

06:33.795 --> 06:35.684
It's quick and quiet.

06:43.754 --> 06:47.067
The killer might have left some
epithelials on the pillowcase.

06:47.715 --> 06:49.705
You know what...
Let's collect all the bedding.

06:49.705 --> 06:51.925
I think we need to go
through it back at the lab.

06:52.921 --> 06:57.617
I got a lead on Kim's, uh, business.
Turns out she works out of her house.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.533
I'll go with you.

06:58.534 --> 06:58.910
All right.

06:58.911 --> 07:00.753
- Are you good ?
- Yeah.

07:14.669 --> 07:17.801
Kim had an appointment
with a client last night.

07:17.802 --> 07:19.216
She went to Prone.

07:19.217 --> 07:20.292
Kim was a madam ?

07:20.293 --> 07:21.602
Madam ? No.

07:21.603 --> 07:22.828
Kim was a Wing Chick.

07:22.829 --> 07:23.733
"A Wing Chick" ?

07:23.734 --> 07:25.836
We have a business : Wing Chicks.

07:25.904 --> 07:29.006
We're an introduction service.
We introduce men to women.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.947
For a price. I mean,
come on, this is about sex.

07:31.948 --> 07:35.674
That part's up to the guy.
We do the intro, and then we're out.

07:36.070 --> 07:38.797
You see, women are more likely
to talk to a strange man

07:38.840 --> 07:40.797
if they're introduced by a woman.

07:40.798 --> 07:42.831
Even if the woman is a stranger, too.

07:42.832 --> 07:45.068
So, your company
has a high success rate.

07:45.069 --> 07:46.622
Try 100%.

07:46.623 --> 07:49.489
We need to know who Kim
was winging for last night.

08:03.290 --> 08:04.896
Robert Smith.

08:04.897 --> 08:06.646
Let me check his profile.

08:11.165 --> 08:14.862
None of these guys seem like they would
have a problem getting a date on their own.

08:14.863 --> 08:18.692
We do have a screening process.
After all, we are vouching for them.

08:18.693 --> 08:21.506
No shorties, fatties, baldies...

08:22.685 --> 08:23.846
Sorry.

08:24.791 --> 08:27.250
Mouth breathers, uglies...

08:27.291 --> 08:29.664
Sounds like you reject
a lot of potential clients.

08:29.665 --> 08:32.486
It's called Wing Chicks,
not Miracle Workers.

08:32.486 --> 08:34.318
You can make a lot of
enemies that way.

08:34.366 --> 08:36.681
- Do you know of any enemies ?
- No.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.706
Here it is. Robert Smith.

08:39.707 --> 08:42.732
Out-of-towner. He's staying at
the National on Collins.

08:42.732 --> 08:44.014
"Out-of-towner" ?

08:44.143 --> 08:45.984
Comes to South Beach
for the weekend,

08:45.985 --> 08:49.184
gets a hotel, rental car
and calls us to meet a girl.

08:49.185 --> 08:51.606
Can we take this with us
and make a couple of copies ?

08:51.607 --> 08:53.885
- Long as I get it back.
- Sure.

08:59.439 --> 09:00.773
H. You got a minute ?

09:00.774 --> 09:01.654
Always.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.738
Listen, I lost my badge,
or someone took it.

09:05.849 --> 09:06.807
Are you sure ?

09:06.808 --> 09:08.316
I've looked everywhere.
It's in the wind.

09:08.317 --> 09:10.338
Okay, it's got to be somewhere.

09:11.670 --> 09:13.736
Maybe this girl I met.

09:15.060 --> 09:16.907
You think she took it, Eric ?

09:17.870 --> 09:20.465
- It could be.
- Have you talked to her ?

09:20.466 --> 09:21.528
I can't.

09:21.529 --> 09:23.981
Eric, when there is a badge
in the wrong hands...

09:23.982 --> 09:27.743
Yeah, I know. I just need a little
advice on how to handle this.

09:27.744 --> 09:30.339
Play it straight. We file
the paperwork, we take the hit.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.599
That means involving IAB.
I mean, that's

09:32.600 --> 09:35.798
- guilty until proven innocent.
- Well, you've done nothing wrong.

09:36.853 --> 09:39.562
Then how come it feels like
I'm going to slit my own throat ?

09:39.563 --> 09:41.871
Find the girl, all right ?

10:22.813 --> 10:23.867
Breath strip.

10:25.901 --> 10:27.286
Extremely fragile.

10:27.826 --> 10:30.119
I'll have to photograph it
and then scan it.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.643
Okay, this is a priority.

10:31.644 --> 10:32.845
They all are.

10:32.846 --> 10:34.308
Why don't you take a seat ?

10:36.033 --> 10:38.658
I'll have to set up the camera
without lights first,

10:38.659 --> 10:40.326
then bracket the stops.

10:40.327 --> 10:42.151
Just don't melt it.

10:58.599 --> 11:02.000
Robert Smith checked out of
the National. He paid cash.

11:02.027 --> 11:05.007
I'm thinking it's a fake name.
I'm having Tripp check into it.

11:05.397 --> 11:06.627
Joseph, is this our case ?

11:06.662 --> 11:08.364
Yeah, I found it
stuck to the bedding.

11:10.850 --> 11:12.161
Harry Klugman.

11:12.396 --> 11:13.644
Let's bring him in.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.544
We found your fingerprint

11:15.579 --> 11:18.377
on this mint strip at
Club Prone last night.

11:19.208 --> 11:20.842
Must have dropped it.

11:29.740 --> 11:30.949
Can I help you ?

11:35.574 --> 11:37.220
It was lodged between
the sheets of a bed

11:37.255 --> 11:38.900
with a dead woman lying in it.

11:38.935 --> 11:39.744
Kim Burton.

11:40.007 --> 11:41.171
Can you explain that ?

11:41.206 --> 11:43.237
Never even heard of her, so...

11:44.481 --> 11:47.533
Yet, we found you
in her reject pile.

11:52.608 --> 11:55.088
Girl was a bitch, okay ?

11:55.612 --> 11:58.899
She told me that I'd
never be a client of hers.

11:58.934 --> 12:00.209
Too ugly.

12:00.244 --> 12:02.287
So I got a little work done.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.385
Went to the gym.

12:03.420 --> 12:04.523
Got a spray tan.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.105
Then you went to
the club to find Kim.

12:06.140 --> 12:07.672
She didn't even recognize me.

12:09.289 --> 12:10.760
She gave me a card.

12:12.326 --> 12:14.629
She said that I was
a prime candidate.

12:14.664 --> 12:16.452
Love to introduce me to girls.

12:16.487 --> 12:17.343
Here.

12:19.974 --> 12:22.469
I'm the same guy she
rejected six months earlier.

12:22.504 --> 12:24.532
Wouldn't even give me
the time of day, so...

12:26.275 --> 12:27.481
So you killed her ?

12:29.231 --> 12:31.414
No way. I took the card, and I left.

12:32.431 --> 12:34.248
Hey, she picked me.

12:34.283 --> 12:36.354
She wanted me as a client.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.004
That, that was the victory
that I wanted, okay?

12:39.512 --> 12:41.258
You'd make a great client.

12:45.441 --> 12:47.113
No, you're gonna have
to do better than that.

12:47.148 --> 12:48.700
I don't think so.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.023
I want my lawyer.

12:53.831 --> 12:55.379
We want your DNA.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.307
So how'd you two hook up ?

13:03.602 --> 13:05.089
After our initial message,

13:05.124 --> 13:07.232
she sent me a
second text message

13:07.267 --> 13:08.552
to meet her outside the club.

13:09.107 --> 13:11.409
We did, and we walked across
the street into the building.

13:11.444 --> 13:12.890
Where you engaged in
sexual intercourse ?

13:12.925 --> 13:14.729
Consensual sexual intercourse.

13:14.764 --> 13:17.418
Nevertheless, it was outside
in a public place, right ?

13:17.453 --> 13:19.498
It was night, and the
building was closed.

13:23.912 --> 13:25.927
You could have been arrested
for indecent exposure.

13:26.454 --> 13:28.362
Lose your job, your
reputation here.

13:29.447 --> 13:32.086
Your police report states that
this woman can be contacted

13:32.121 --> 13:35.237
or identified
through a screen name.

13:36.212 --> 13:37.764
You don't know
who she is, do you ?

13:38.405 --> 13:39.956
No, I don't.

13:39.991 --> 13:41.564
Your behavior is reckless.

13:41.599 --> 13:43.397
You're putting the
department at risk.

13:43.432 --> 13:45.289
Look, what I did
was not a crime

13:45.324 --> 13:46.824
and nobody got hurt.

13:46.859 --> 13:49.545
I'm thinking there's got to be
some kind of underlying problem

13:49.546 --> 13:52.231
for you to be putting your
career at risk this way, you know ?

13:52.266 --> 13:53.284
I'm fine.

13:53.319 --> 13:55.571
How long have you been engaging
in this kind of activity ?

13:56.148 --> 13:59.252
See, if I had to guess, I'd say about
the time of Speedle's death, right ?

13:59.287 --> 14:01.142
What ? You're gonna
make this about Speedle ?

14:01.177 --> 14:02.837
I mean, everybody knows
you guys were tight.

14:02.872 --> 14:04.008
His death you know

14:04.043 --> 14:06.039
may have caused you to suffer
some feelings of abandonment.

14:06.074 --> 14:09.024
That's a bunch of
psychobabble... crap.

14:09.059 --> 14:11.586
You can't lose somebody you never
cared about in the first place.

14:11.621 --> 14:13.810
Speedle lost his life.

14:14.193 --> 14:15.970
Now you lost your badge.

14:16.365 --> 14:17.644
So you even yet ?

14:19.057 --> 14:20.688
I'm done with this interview.

14:34.708 --> 14:38.448
Okay, Section 232 of our
pillowcase murder weapon.

14:49.536 --> 14:51.172
These things take time.

14:51.207 --> 14:52.648
I see you cut up
the murder weapon,

14:52.683 --> 14:53.615
I get antsy.

14:53.650 --> 14:54.913
This pillowcase's been in a club.

14:54.948 --> 14:56.944
There's probably DNA all over it.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.366
According to the club owner, at
1:00 a.m., the beds double in price.

14:59.401 --> 15:01.709
At ten to, the beds get fresh linen.

15:01.744 --> 15:03.691
That helps, I guess.

15:08.331 --> 15:09.554
Got you a profile.

15:09.589 --> 15:12.084
You compare that to Harry
Klugman's DNA, please.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.447
Okay, but I can tell you
right now it's not a match.

15:14.774 --> 15:15.669
How ?

15:15.704 --> 15:17.766
Amylogenin says
DNA's from a female.

15:19.854 --> 15:20.910
Then the question is:

15:20.945 --> 15:23.201
what female would benefit
most from her death?

15:29.639 --> 15:31.126
You've got it all wrong.

15:31.283 --> 15:33.258
Without Kim,
there is no Wing Chicks.

15:33.293 --> 15:35.207
I thought the two of you
were business partners.

15:35.242 --> 15:38.694
We are, but I provide finance
and manage the paperwork.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.276
Strictly behind the scenes.

15:40.311 --> 15:42.386
Kim works the bars and the clients.

15:42.421 --> 15:45.626
Does your company introduce,
uh, women to women ?

15:45.661 --> 15:46.856
No, silly.

15:46.891 --> 15:48.714
Women don't have any
trouble meeting women.

15:48.749 --> 15:50.858
That's the premise
behind our whole business.

15:50.893 --> 15:52.421
What about angry girlfriends ?

15:52.456 --> 15:54.529
Guys with girlfriends
don't need us either.

15:54.604 --> 15:56.442
They meet all the
women they want.

15:58.151 --> 15:59.462
MBL.

15:59.497 --> 16:00.722
What's that ?

16:00.757 --> 16:03.055
Client category :
"married but looking".

16:03.090 --> 16:04.870
You fix up married men ?

16:04.905 --> 16:06.055
We're here to make a profit.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.031
And break up some homes, apparently.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.358
We don't really look
at that end of it.

16:11.393 --> 16:13.676
Well, it may have cost
your partner her life.

16:21.168 --> 16:23.203
Your car was parked at
the National last night.

16:23.238 --> 16:24.635
Under the name Robert Smith.

16:24.670 --> 16:26.442
Only it's registered
to a Butch Raleigh.

16:27.168 --> 16:28.278
What do you want ?

16:28.313 --> 16:30.284
How'd you get those
scratches on your face ?

16:30.640 --> 16:32.527
Bought a new kitten for my kids.

16:32.562 --> 16:34.248
How about that fat lip ?

16:34.382 --> 16:35.613
It's a big kitten.

16:36.014 --> 16:38.456
Maybe you got all scratched
up when you killed Kim Burton.

16:46.084 --> 16:47.484
I didn't kill anyone.

16:47.711 --> 16:48.740
Kill ?

16:49.350 --> 16:50.598
Are you cops ?

16:50.849 --> 16:51.828
Yes, ma'am.

16:52.483 --> 16:53.833
What did he do ?

16:53.868 --> 16:56.459
We're here investigating
the murder of a young woman.

16:56.494 --> 16:58.046
She was an acquaintance
of your husband.

16:58.973 --> 17:00.369
Acquaintance.

17:00.404 --> 17:01.785
Is that what they
call themselves now ?

17:01.820 --> 17:02.382
Lucy...

17:02.417 --> 17:04.223
Found out he was
fooling around on me.

17:04.361 --> 17:06.025
Got home late last night.

17:06.060 --> 17:08.104
And let's just say we
came to an agreement.

17:08.138 --> 17:10.347
You make those
scratches on his face ?

17:10.646 --> 17:12.118
I'm not admitting anything.

17:12.233 --> 17:13.248
All I can tell you

17:13.282 --> 17:16.037
is Butch will cooperate
fully with your investigation.

17:16.071 --> 17:18.117
Great. We'll start
with a DNA sample.

17:18.153 --> 17:19.343
Whatever you need.

17:19.377 --> 17:20.256
From you.

17:20.580 --> 17:21.742
From me ?

17:25.712 --> 17:27.166
What's the range
on these things ?

17:27.636 --> 17:29.447
Uh, 30 feet. Give or take.

17:29.778 --> 17:31.065
That's awfully narrow.

17:31.100 --> 17:33.849
Yeah, this technology's
based on an RF protocol.

17:33.884 --> 17:35.991
Sends out a
short-range beacon.

17:36.026 --> 17:36.970
It's kind of like, um,

17:37.005 --> 17:39.745
sending an instant message
to the air around you.

18:01.023 --> 18:03.195
Wireless dating, Delko ?

18:03.300 --> 18:05.036
I don't know why you just
don't go talk to them.

18:05.071 --> 18:06.786
I mean, you're, like, 30 feet away.

18:06.821 --> 18:08.075
It's not a date.

18:08.572 --> 18:10.847
Besides, I'd rather
just cut to the chase.

18:12.581 --> 18:14.361
You tooth all these girls ?

18:14.712 --> 18:17.055
They answer back if
they're interested. Simple.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.146
Seems kind of desperate to me.

18:19.285 --> 18:21.054
Would you just help me find her ?

18:21.089 --> 18:24.129
Yeah, uh, so, you
remember her screen name ?

18:24.982 --> 18:26.502
"Up4anything."

18:26.537 --> 18:27.780
"Up4anything" ?

18:27.815 --> 18:28.900
Run it.

18:37.364 --> 18:38.548
Oh. No dice.

18:38.583 --> 18:42.099
She's either out of
range or her phone's off.

18:42.134 --> 18:43.739
Screen name's all I've got.

18:43.774 --> 18:46.068
Once you're out of
range, you're untraceable.

18:46.103 --> 18:47.746
Not for long.

18:47.781 --> 18:50.237
Look, if anybody
asks, I'm in the field.

19:28.312 --> 19:31.041
"H", I got the prints
from last night's hookup.

19:31.076 --> 19:32.003
One could be the girl.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.449
You're gonna have to follow it.
I've got a shooting, Eric.

19:34.770 --> 19:35.650
It's trouble ?

19:35.685 --> 19:38.948
The suspect... flashed a badge.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.952
- So what do we have ?
- Ed Godfrey.

19:46.987 --> 19:48.193
Single gunshot wound.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.654
Shooter's still at large.

19:50.737 --> 19:52.762
And this gentleman is our witness?

19:52.797 --> 19:54.649
Yep. Clint Roster.

19:55.731 --> 19:56.999
Owns the vehicle.

19:57.390 --> 19:59.795
- I'll notify the ME's office.
- Thank you, ma'am.

19:59.830 --> 20:00.490
You got it.

20:00.525 --> 20:02.757
Mr. Roster, can you
tell me what happened ?

20:02.834 --> 20:04.440
My buddy and I were just talking.

20:04.545 --> 20:07.052
Cop walks up and
starts shooting at us.

20:07.136 --> 20:10.407
A police officer walked up to you and
your buddy and just started shooting.

20:10.442 --> 20:11.836
I find that hard to believe.

20:11.914 --> 20:14.336
Yeah, tell it to the dude who
shoved his badge in my face

20:14.371 --> 20:15.958
just before he shot my buddy.

20:21.673 --> 20:22.776
You get a badge number ?

20:22.811 --> 20:25.279
I was too busy staring
down the barrel of his gun.

20:25.415 --> 20:28.107
I notice that your trunk
is open, Mr. Roster.

20:28.186 --> 20:30.268
Cop must've opened it. After.

20:30.303 --> 20:33.559
After he just started shooting
at you and your buddy, right ?

20:38.458 --> 20:42.058
Well, here's the
problem, Mr. Roster.

20:42.123 --> 20:45.391
The bullet strike is inside the trunk

20:45.426 --> 20:48.234
which means it happened
during the shooting.

20:50.779 --> 20:52.325
So it was open. So what ?

20:52.410 --> 20:54.224
This is what, Mr. Roster.

20:54.259 --> 20:56.128
You see this white
powder right there ?

20:57.416 --> 20:59.635
It's my guess that
that's cocaine.

21:00.569 --> 21:02.133
And you were dealing.

21:02.599 --> 21:05.383
Well, it doesn't give one of
your cops the right to rip us off.

21:05.458 --> 21:07.139
Here's a newsflash for you.

21:07.174 --> 21:10.010
The man who shot your friend
was not a police officer,

21:10.045 --> 21:11.655
and you're under arrest.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.219
Take him, please.

21:27.706 --> 21:29.868
You killed my brother,
Raymond Caine.

21:29.933 --> 21:31.814
And now I can prove it.

21:33.813 --> 21:36.308
He was a degenerate.

21:37.026 --> 21:37.925
Sir?

22:20.657 --> 22:21.910
You wanted to see me, Horatio ?

22:21.941 --> 22:24.070
Do you have something to tell me, Rick ?

22:24.353 --> 22:26.461
I haven't made a determination
on Delko's case...

22:26.463 --> 22:29.661
I'm not talking about Delko.
Bob Keaton.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.286
- It's your brother's killer.
- Correct.

22:33.458 --> 22:34.784
- He got life imprisonment.

22:34.858 --> 22:37.284
Then why did I see him
on the street today ?

22:38.342 --> 22:39.638
That's impossible.

22:41.368 --> 22:43.589
You don't know anything about this, do you ?

22:43.743 --> 22:45.717
No. I do not.

22:47.830 --> 22:50.946
- But I can look into it.
- Don't bother. I'll do it.

22:55.622 --> 22:56.455
Hey.

22:56.921 --> 22:59.404
Look, I got six lifts I need scanned.

22:59.573 --> 23:00.561
Rush.

23:00.607 --> 23:02.627
Look, I heard your badge problem.

23:02.745 --> 23:05.876
I'm not jeopardizing my job
to help you find some girl, Delko.

23:05.914 --> 23:09.349
Listen, we think the badge could
have been used in a murder today.

23:10.367 --> 23:11.678
Like I said...

23:12.549 --> 23:13.860
I'll get right on it.

23:13.922 --> 23:14.735
So,

23:14.881 --> 23:16.701
these were at the scene of the crime ?

23:17.845 --> 23:19.294
You could say that.

23:33.784 --> 23:35.126
Try it again.

23:49.783 --> 23:51.279
All right. Next.

24:00.627 --> 24:02.015
Patti Welborn.

24:02.293 --> 24:04.082
All right, I need an address.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.504
- Out of luck.
- There's none listed ?

24:07.457 --> 24:09.843
This guy hold anyone up
since the coke bust ?

24:09.843 --> 24:11.103
No, not yet.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.553
But the day's young.

24:43.556 --> 24:45.072
Your doper's car give it up ?

24:45.125 --> 24:46.110
Yeah.

24:46.233 --> 24:48.572
The bullet from the trunk and then some.

24:49.402 --> 24:50.848
. 357.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.802
Same caliber that killed your vic.

24:53.013 --> 24:54.382
You got anything else ?

24:54.413 --> 24:56.536
Some sort of impression on the bumper.

24:56.598 --> 24:57.982
I haven't figured it out yet.

24:58.001 --> 25:00.647
You will. I'll take a look at this.

25:21.781 --> 25:22.998
IBIS get us anything ?

25:23.029 --> 25:24.862
Four hits on the. 357.

25:24.893 --> 25:26.280
All commercial robberies.

25:26.587 --> 25:27.928
Any suspect info ?

25:28.005 --> 25:29.976
No. Not in custody.

25:30.161 --> 25:31.871
I'm afraid we've hit a dead end.

25:33.045 --> 25:35.633
My badge is being used in murders.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.052
I got no one to blame but myself.

25:40.133 --> 25:42.675
If it helps, this is
atypical behavior for you.

25:42.798 --> 25:43.784
Yeah.

25:43.985 --> 25:47.300
Stetler seems to think this has
something to do with Speedle.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.640
That's interesting.

25:48.686 --> 25:50.596
You know what I think about Stetler.

25:56.897 --> 25:59.609
Lucy Raleigh, wife of
married-but-looking ?

25:59.670 --> 26:02.797
She wasn't the one holding
a pillow over Wing Chick's face.

26:02.843 --> 26:05.293
My money's on Noelle,
the business partner.

26:06.446 --> 26:07.948
Not Noelle, either.

26:08.072 --> 26:10.937
- You sure ?
- DNA's funny that way.

26:12.264 --> 26:14.174
Find me another woman to compare it to.

26:14.583 --> 26:17.371
Okay. Run the pillowcase
results through CODIS.

26:17.464 --> 26:18.776
You're looking for a female ?

26:18.776 --> 26:23.176
I know, I know. 95% of the samples in the
offender database are male. Just humor me.

26:34.087 --> 26:36.598
- What ?
- Case from our department.

26:38.277 --> 26:40.304
You get a CODIS hit from the pillowcase ?

26:40.381 --> 26:43.354
It's flagged. Get out.
You can't see this.

26:45.587 --> 26:46.863
Gabrielle Marinelli.

26:46.894 --> 26:48.234
The schoolteacher at the bar ?

26:48.265 --> 26:50.684
- Get out.
- Is she our murderer ?

26:51.623 --> 26:52.841
Oh, God.

26:52.902 --> 26:55.090
State Attorney's gonna kill me.

27:00.032 --> 27:03.067
You put the DNA profile of a rape victim

27:03.159 --> 27:05.393
into a criminal database ?

27:05.732 --> 27:07.904
Six months ago.
I don't know how it happened.

27:07.935 --> 27:09.752
Don, it was a mistake.

27:09.787 --> 27:14.778
Complete violation of a victim's privacy.
If you use this, we're all looking at lawsuits.

27:14.809 --> 27:17.074
The girl in question could be my killer.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.830
She is a rape victim...

27:19.264 --> 27:20.681
who cooperated.

27:21.190 --> 27:23.685
She cannot be penalized
for that in any way.

27:23.740 --> 27:25.573
Okay, then we'll find another way.

27:25.604 --> 27:26.606
Good.

27:27.970 --> 27:29.418
Because until you do,

27:29.495 --> 27:32.132
Gabrielle Marinelli is untouchable.

27:36.415 --> 27:37.755
I'm sorry.

27:37.896 --> 27:40.068
No worries. We go forward. Okay ?

27:45.216 --> 27:47.501
Yeah, Calleigh. Listen,
we need to reapproach

27:47.501 --> 27:51.501
the club case and table all the
information we got from Valera.

27:51.587 --> 27:54.776
Right. Bring everyone from
the club back in here, please.

28:02.044 --> 28:03.984
I already told you what I know.

28:04.363 --> 28:07.490
We're reinterviewing all
of the witnesses from the bar.

28:07.632 --> 28:11.006
See if anyone remembers
anything about Kim Burton that night.

28:11.052 --> 28:13.270
You are the bartender.
You were there all night.

28:13.362 --> 28:15.134
Somebody saw me, right ?

28:15.799 --> 28:16.615
Yes.

28:16.985 --> 28:18.217
She was passed out.

28:18.325 --> 28:21.167
I thought she was passed out.
I didn't know she was dead.

28:22.712 --> 28:25.130
Went over like I was giving her change,

28:25.577 --> 28:27.456
I took 200 from her purse.

28:35.623 --> 28:39.120
Did you see anyone else approach
her bed that night before you did ?

28:39.228 --> 28:41.646
- Am I going to jail ?
- It depends.

28:45.865 --> 28:49.192
I saw some chick climb onto the bed,
but that happens all the time.

28:49.324 --> 28:51.619
Girls want to tell her
their broken-heart stories.

28:51.681 --> 28:53.467
Do you see the girl out there ?

28:54.195 --> 28:55.119
Yeah.

28:55.212 --> 28:57.430
Yeah, the hot one next to the blonde.

28:59.065 --> 29:00.883
Okay. Thank you.

29:02.562 --> 29:05.631
Are you wearing the same clothes
you wore last night at the club ?

29:05.692 --> 29:07.094
No. Why ?

29:07.140 --> 29:10.624
We'd like to process them
regarding the murder of Kim Burton.

29:10.740 --> 29:13.166
I told you, I hardly even know her.

29:13.590 --> 29:16.210
We have a witness who saw
the two of you together on her bed.

29:16.272 --> 29:17.658
They're lying.

29:17.874 --> 29:19.168
I don't think so.

29:19.540 --> 29:22.898
Miss Burton spilled something
on her bedspread. It was a margarita.

29:22.944 --> 29:26.472
You have a stain on the bottom
of your purse, and I can see salt in it.

29:32.935 --> 29:36.077
Hey, can I ask you a couple of
questions about your business ?

29:36.092 --> 29:37.725
Sure. For a drink.

29:45.564 --> 29:47.336
Do you care if we test it ?

29:48.568 --> 29:51.849
Go ahead. All it proves is
I sat next to her.

29:51.879 --> 29:53.882
Now you're changing your story.

29:58.157 --> 30:00.394
Miss Marinelli, because we've
caught you in a lie

30:00.465 --> 30:02.394
based on the residue on
the bottom of your purse,

30:02.428 --> 30:05.157
we are able to pursue an
investigation into your background

30:05.228 --> 30:07.157
and as to why you would want
to kill Kim Burton.

30:07.182 --> 30:08.506
Are you trying to scare me ?

30:08.568 --> 30:09.436
No, Miss.

30:09.436 --> 30:13.836
We're giving you the opportunity to confess
to whatever might have transpired last night.

30:14.100 --> 30:15.410
I went out,

30:15.441 --> 30:17.720
talked to some people, and went home.

30:17.751 --> 30:19.661
Just like I'm doing now.

30:29.985 --> 30:31.788
Out on good behavior ?

30:32.085 --> 30:34.711
The man killed a police officer. Well...

30:35.219 --> 30:38.285
Just hang on a second.
You are his probation officer. I want...

30:38.502 --> 30:40.720
I want you to explain it to me, that's all.

30:41.259 --> 30:43.154
Okay, um, you know what ?

30:43.188 --> 30:45.052
Could I have his place of employment ?

30:45.668 --> 30:47.855
Right. I know where that is. Thank you.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.457
- Hi.
- Hey.

30:51.977 --> 30:54.503
Why do you have Ray's case file out ?

30:54.596 --> 30:56.999
- That's his killer.
- You know, I...

30:57.553 --> 30:59.833
I just want to make sure
that everything's in order.

30:59.879 --> 31:02.843
- And it is, right ?
- Yeah. Everything is...

31:02.858 --> 31:04.031
Everything's fine.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.722
- You would tell me, right ?
- Of course I would.

31:36.549 --> 31:38.228
- Your phone.
- What ?

31:38.275 --> 31:41.193
Give me your phone.
I think I figured something out.

32:33.796 --> 32:35.475
What the hell did you do to my phone ?

32:35.521 --> 32:37.893
Uh, that's a 2.4-gigahertz antenna.

32:37.922 --> 32:41.234
You just went from 30 feet to 5,000.

32:41.450 --> 32:42.929
That's a mile.

32:43.591 --> 32:44.962
That's great.

32:45.140 --> 32:46.357
I owe you one.

33:10.995 --> 33:11.963
"Wanna get together ?"

33:22.013 --> 33:23.223
"R U Hearby ?"

33:25.996 --> 33:28.968
"Where have you been ?"

33:32.932 --> 33:36.301
"Let's hook up."

33:39.949 --> 33:41.438
"How bout now, our spot."

33:49.354 --> 33:49.926
Hi.

33:50.343 --> 33:51.608
I missed you.

33:51.757 --> 33:53.451
Who did you give my badge to ?

33:53.580 --> 33:56.260
Listen to me.
Who did you give my badge to ?

33:56.295 --> 33:58.666
- I've been trying to get a hold of you.
- Yeah, sure you have.

33:58.714 --> 34:01.374
Look, I knew if I called your
department you'd get in trouble.

34:01.382 --> 34:04.029
I'm already in trouble.
That badge was used in a murder.

34:04.029 --> 34:04.699
What ?

34:04.854 --> 34:05.494
Yes.

34:05.868 --> 34:09.342
I figured you'd message me back
or something, so I kept it at home.

34:09.404 --> 34:10.915
Then what happened to it ?

34:11.172 --> 34:12.568
Somebody took it out of my room.

34:12.580 --> 34:13.947
Somebody like who ?

34:15.456 --> 34:17.945
Only one who's been there
recently is my brother.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.273
Give me his address.

34:22.681 --> 34:25.322
- You got squat.
- Actually, no.

34:25.603 --> 34:28.047
A search of your apartment
recovered a gun.

34:28.089 --> 34:29.944
Anybody could have shot that gun.

34:30.690 --> 34:31.822
And these.

34:33.090 --> 34:33.697
What ?

34:33.775 --> 34:34.879
My jeans ?

34:35.886 --> 34:37.364
You cops make me laugh.

34:37.456 --> 34:38.784
So they're yours ?

34:39.301 --> 34:41.027
'Course they are.
What does that prove ?

34:41.518 --> 34:43.911
The black residue on them
matches the exhaust

34:43.911 --> 34:45.453
from the car at the murder scene.

34:45.536 --> 34:46.110
So ?

34:46.572 --> 34:48.745
So the irregular pattern on the bumper--

34:48.827 --> 34:51.141
that matches the
stitching on your jeans.

34:56.168 --> 34:59.728
They're individually sewn,
which makes each pair unique,

34:59.868 --> 35:01.015
one of a kind.

35:01.149 --> 35:02.787
It's like denim DNA.

35:03.561 --> 35:05.199
You killed Ed Godfrey.

35:07.565 --> 35:08.752
Open the trunk.

35:08.915 --> 35:10.684
Miami-Dade Police. Let's go.

35:31.315 --> 35:33.292
You're under arrest for murder.

35:34.285 --> 35:36.641
Give me back my badge.

35:57.961 --> 36:00.227
All right, check it out
and call me back.

36:01.218 --> 36:02.275
Hey, Tripp,

36:02.476 --> 36:04.656
can we run an EI from your computer ?

36:04.741 --> 36:06.701
Uh, yeah, have at it.

36:06.924 --> 36:08.553
Actually, we want you to do it.

36:08.637 --> 36:10.121
You got a broken arm today ?

36:10.211 --> 36:10.909
It's a...

36:10.909 --> 36:13.968
sticky situation.
We need to be above reproach.

36:16.386 --> 36:18.702
All right, but I'm going to
warn you : I hunt and I peck.

36:18.752 --> 36:20.776
I don't want anybody
breathing down my neck.

36:20.886 --> 36:23.025
All right, we won't even
exhale until you're done.

36:23.995 --> 36:24.555
Okay.

36:24.841 --> 36:26.854
The individual is Gabrielle

36:27.307 --> 36:28.176
Marinelli.

36:45.047 --> 36:46.239
Okay, there it is.

36:46.239 --> 36:48.775
She was a complainant in
a rape charge six months ago.

36:48.896 --> 36:51.911
She was raped in the parking lot
across the street from the club.

36:51.949 --> 36:54.396
Still, that doesn't explain
why she went after Kim.

36:54.482 --> 36:56.450
It might. What's the suspect's name ?

36:56.533 --> 36:57.665
Scott Brown.

36:58.138 --> 37:01.233
Listen, I ran every one of
the guys in that lady's client list.

37:02.396 --> 37:04.023
I've got a Steve Brown.

37:07.345 --> 37:09.974
Yeah, it's the same guy.
Was he convicted ?

37:10.091 --> 37:10.905
No,

37:11.277 --> 37:12.836
the case was never filed.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.155
We may have found our motive.

37:18.610 --> 37:21.053
Kim introduced you to Scott Brown.

37:21.449 --> 37:23.426
He was the suspect in your rape.

37:25.260 --> 37:27.404
She told me they were old friends.

37:27.866 --> 37:29.251
Vouched for him.

37:30.789 --> 37:34.117
I never would have talked to him
if she hadn't introduced me.

37:35.298 --> 37:37.474
He hired her for just that reason.

37:40.014 --> 37:42.179
I totally let my guard down.

37:42.873 --> 37:44.751
Started talking to him.

37:45.821 --> 37:48.188
We left to go to another club, and...

37:48.527 --> 37:49.510
he raped me.

37:52.556 --> 37:54.117
I did everything right.

37:54.993 --> 37:58.479
I called the police, went
to the hospital, did the exam.

37:58.576 --> 38:02.545
Then the prosecutor won't file,
since we were on a date.

38:02.648 --> 38:05.259
Guy claimed the sex was consensual.

38:05.495 --> 38:09.148
Prosecutor said something
about it being hard to prove.

38:09.663 --> 38:12.151
So you went back to
the club to look for Kim.

38:12.239 --> 38:12.909
No.

38:13.475 --> 38:17.206
I hadn't gone anywhere in
four months because of fear.

38:17.610 --> 38:21.273
I went back to the club
so I could face my fear

38:21.273 --> 38:23.294
and get on with my life.

38:23.365 --> 38:24.618
And you saw Kim.

38:26.849 --> 38:27.640
Excuse me,

38:27.640 --> 38:29.176
two margaritas, please.

38:30.267 --> 38:31.725
This is my dear friend Robert.

38:31.725 --> 38:35.451
We were college roommates,
and now he's a financier from DC...

38:39.784 --> 38:42.050
That's when I realized what she did.

38:43.138 --> 38:44.441
"Wing Chick."

38:45.390 --> 38:47.921
Passing off strangers as friends.

38:47.980 --> 38:51.032
Nobody heard or saw any
arguments with Kim that night.

38:51.311 --> 38:53.054
That's 'cause we didn't fight.

38:56.077 --> 38:57.547
You look familiar.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.531
Must be the margarita.

39:01.482 --> 39:05.845
Do you even worry about the girls
you fix these guys up with ?

39:05.923 --> 39:08.603
The only thing I worry about
is if the check clears.

39:08.951 --> 39:11.643
What about the girl who
gets her heart broken ?

39:11.724 --> 39:13.026
Or worse ?

39:13.735 --> 39:14.665
Own it.

39:16.749 --> 39:18.571
Take responsibility.

39:19.836 --> 39:21.745
Just quit the blame game.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.949
I can't believe I really did it.

39:49.963 --> 39:54.425
But if I just saved one girl
from one of her dates,

39:55.295 --> 39:57.133
maybe it was worth it.

40:05.206 --> 40:08.058
You might not want to say that
to the State Attorney.

40:10.975 --> 40:11.780
Oh.

40:12.302 --> 40:13.293
Okay.

40:14.303 --> 40:15.768
Thanks.

40:43.109 --> 40:45.035
Valera, what's going on ?

40:45.144 --> 40:46.889
Getting kicked out of my lab.

40:46.998 --> 40:48.262
Relieved of duty.

40:48.342 --> 40:48.871
What ?

40:48.896 --> 40:51.318
You'll have to get
someone else to do your DNA.

40:51.541 --> 40:53.722
I'm sorry I saw the vic's name.

40:55.350 --> 40:56.456
It's okay.

40:58.491 --> 40:59.684
I looked.

41:01.115 --> 41:04.224
It's like that Greek thing
in the Bible where the guy looks

41:04.224 --> 41:05.655
and turns into stone.

41:05.710 --> 41:08.109
- Only I did.
- Greek and Bible ?

41:09.036 --> 41:11.241
It's a pillar of salt.

41:11.838 --> 41:13.622
Salt. Stone.

41:14.568 --> 41:15.597
Either way...

41:16.582 --> 41:17.937
I'm gone.

41:26.179 --> 41:26.833
Hi.

41:28.154 --> 41:29.860
What's with the evidence boxes ?

41:29.879 --> 41:33.783
Review of all Valera's casework
over the last six months.

41:34.216 --> 41:37.345
Something about DNA and ASCLAD.

41:37.582 --> 41:40.120
- She gone for good ?
- I don't know.

41:40.206 --> 41:43.000
I guess it depends on
what these boxes say.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.787
We meet again, Bob.

42:36.053 --> 42:38.254
I wasn't sure you
recognized me today.

42:38.321 --> 42:40.068
I never forget a face.

42:41.638 --> 42:43.310
Now, Bob, you're a cop killer.

42:43.310 --> 42:44.907
What are you doing out on the street ?

42:46.122 --> 42:48.385
My paperwork says I'm out on parole.

42:49.179 --> 42:51.384
Are you working undercover, Bob ?

42:54.204 --> 42:55.651
DEA ?

42:56.177 --> 42:58.334
Just like your brother, Raymond.

42:59.043 --> 43:01.007
So you didn't shoot Raymond.

43:02.282 --> 43:03.843
I shot him.

43:04.739 --> 43:06.650
We had to make it look good.

43:06.842 --> 43:08.266
It was a drug deal.

43:11.630 --> 43:14.145
Is Raymond still alive, Bob ?

43:17.195 --> 43:18.387
Yeah.

43:23.900 --> 43:27.322
- Look, man, I'm deep undercover.
- I didn't see you,

43:27.469 --> 43:30.044
and you didn't see me, okay ?
