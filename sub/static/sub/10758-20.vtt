WEBVTT

00:10.484 --> 00:12.945
Frasier, was that the author
Dr. Gordon Edelstein?

00:13.153 --> 00:14.780
- Yes.
- I wasn't aware that you knew him.

00:14.989 --> 00:17.866
We just met. You see, the station
is hiring another call-in psychiatrist

00:18.075 --> 00:19.243
for a one-week trial period.

00:19.451 --> 00:21.412
They've asked me
to choose among the finalists.

00:21.620 --> 00:23.622
Well, he'd be wonderful.

00:23.831 --> 00:29.211
I just finished his book on the victims
of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:29.420 --> 00:33.006
Poor tic-ridden devils.

00:33.215 --> 00:36.969
Niles, before you take out your
utensil chamois, I've got to tell you,

00:38.345 --> 00:40.472
I've got another interview
in just a few minutes,

00:40.681 --> 00:42.683
though it's gonna be hard
to top Dr. Edelstein.

00:42.891 --> 00:46.186
- I'd say you're taking this rather well.
- What do you mean?

00:46.395 --> 00:50.232
Many people in your position would
feel threatened at the thought of,

00:50.440 --> 00:53.110
well, another cat
sharing the litter box.

00:54.987 --> 00:57.948
Your flattering analogy aside, Niles,
I take it as a tribute.

00:58.156 --> 01:00.492
Obviously, the station
is so pleased with my show

01:00.701 --> 01:02.244
they're looking
for more of the same.

01:02.411 --> 01:04.538
They can hardly ask me
to do another three hours.

01:04.745 --> 01:06.581
You can imagine
how exhausting that would be.

01:06.790 --> 01:08.750
And for you as well.

01:11.503 --> 01:15.340
Anyway, moving on to me,
what's the verdict?

01:15.841 --> 01:18.760
- Verdict?
- On my new look.

01:18.969 --> 01:21.805
- I say you deserve some of the credit.
- Really?

01:22.013 --> 01:24.933
Yes, you keep saying I should accept
Daphne's relationship with Donny

01:25.141 --> 01:27.811
and find a paramour of my own.
Well, the hunt is on.

01:27.978 --> 01:33.858
I thought to bolster my self-esteem,
I would adopt this raffish new look.

01:34.442 --> 01:37.445
Well, it suits you.

01:37.904 --> 01:41.074
Dashing and yet understated and...

01:41.282 --> 01:44.119
Oh, I give up.
What are we talking about?

01:44.661 --> 01:46.788
My moustache.

01:50.291 --> 01:51.835
I grant you, it's at an early stage.

01:52.043 --> 01:54.420
What stage?
Research and development?

01:55.296 --> 01:59.050
- Dr. Crane. Dr. Nora Fairchild.
- Oh, yes, of course. Welcome.

01:59.259 --> 02:01.302
I can't tell you
what a privilege this is.

02:01.511 --> 02:04.263
I listened to your show today
and I was amazed.

02:04.472 --> 02:05.473
Well...

02:05.682 --> 02:07.642
I hope that doesn't sound
too fawning.

02:07.850 --> 02:10.269
Fawning is just fine. Fawning is fun.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.397
I hope I'm not interrupting
another interview.

02:12.605 --> 02:15.274
No, no, this is my brother, Niles Crane.
He's just about to leave.

02:15.441 --> 02:17.068
I should have known
you two were brothers.

02:17.276 --> 02:19.612
The same superb fashion sense,

02:19.821 --> 02:23.074
the same refined
yet masculine good looks.

02:23.282 --> 02:27.161
You must be so proud
of your kid brother, the radio star.

02:27.370 --> 02:29.038
Well, yes.

02:29.247 --> 02:33.334
Congratulations on your new job.
I hope you'll be very happy at KACL.

02:34.085 --> 02:35.419
Isn't that a bit premature?

02:35.628 --> 02:37.964
Oh, well, let's just say
I know my little brother.

02:44.095 --> 02:48.015
- Well, here's where it all happens.
- Dr. Nora, welcome. Please come in.

02:48.224 --> 02:50.226
I see you've already met
our crack station manager.

02:50.434 --> 02:51.560
Yes. I wanna thank you both

02:51.769 --> 02:53.437
for making me
and my producer feel welcome.

02:53.646 --> 02:55.731
Is everyone around here
as friendly as you two?

02:55.940 --> 02:58.609
- Well...
- Well, hello there.

02:59.318 --> 03:01.612
Some are even friendlier.

03:01.821 --> 03:04.156
This is my producer, Roz Doyle.

03:04.365 --> 03:06.325
Dr. Nora.
And this is my producer, George.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.369
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

03:08.577 --> 03:11.372
Follow me
and I'll give you the lay of the land.

03:14.166 --> 03:18.087
Let's just hope that's a figure
of speech and not a sales pitch.

03:19.338 --> 03:22.341
Well, Nora, please, please,
do come in. Make yourself at home.

03:22.549 --> 03:26.512
Here we are. Get settled in.
Here's your headset.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.014
Of course, the phone lines.
Everything's self-explanatory.

03:29.223 --> 03:31.058
Cough button, on-air button.

03:31.266 --> 03:35.312
Listen, I want you to remember,
it's all right to be nervous.

03:35.479 --> 03:38.565
Even my first show
was a tad bumpy.

03:38.774 --> 03:40.359
Bumpy?

03:41.568 --> 03:45.280
It was a train wreck.
Medic, we got incoming.

03:45.489 --> 03:47.366
Thank you, Kenny.
You weren't even here then.

03:47.574 --> 03:49.201
I got a tape of it
from my Secret Santa.

03:50.744 --> 03:52.204
- Break a leg, Dr. Nora.
- Thank you.

03:52.412 --> 03:53.664
I'll get out of your hair.

03:53.872 --> 03:56.625
Godspeed, Dr. Nora.

04:01.421 --> 04:02.631
What are you smirking about?

04:02.839 --> 04:05.175
Oh, gosh, it's just so much fun
to have a protégé.

04:05.384 --> 04:07.052
Do you see the way
she behaves towards me?

04:07.260 --> 04:12.599
It's like a shy Japanese novice
bowing before her Frasier sensei.

04:13.266 --> 04:15.936
I feel a bow coming on myself.
Could you pass me that wastebasket?

04:16.144 --> 04:18.271
Stop it. All right, she's about to start.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.773
I just wanna catch the beginning,

04:19.981 --> 04:23.360
make sure she's got those
first-show jitters under control.

04:23.568 --> 04:25.654
Let's get right to our first caller.
Who do we have?

04:25.862 --> 04:27.906
We have Jenny from Tacoma
on line one.

04:28.114 --> 04:30.659
Hello, Jenny.
I'm Dr. Nora and I'm here to help.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.494
<i>Hi, Dr. Nora.</i>

04:32.702 --> 04:35.372
<i>My boyfriend and I have been
living together for about two years.</i>

04:35.538 --> 04:36.748
Are you having sex?

04:36.956 --> 04:39.793
<i>Our sex life's not the problem.
It's great.</i>

04:39.959 --> 04:42.879
<i>But whenever I mention marriage,
he changes the subject.</i>

04:43.088 --> 04:44.798
<i>Do you think
that he's afraid of commitment?</i>

04:45.006 --> 04:46.091
No, that's not it.

04:46.299 --> 04:48.635
Let me help you see this
from a different perspective.

04:48.843 --> 04:50.845
You're a whore, Jenny.

04:56.559 --> 04:58.520
You're sleeping with a man
you're not married to.

04:58.728 --> 04:59.771
In my book, that's a whore.

04:59.979 --> 05:02.941
<i>Well, I'm not a whore.
I'm a flight attendant.</i>

05:03.149 --> 05:05.276
Oh, you think there's no overlap?

05:08.154 --> 05:10.907
Well, she's got her jitters
under control.

05:11.074 --> 05:13.743
Wake up, Jenny, you've blown it.
Dump this creep.

05:13.910 --> 05:15.995
Find a new guy,
and until you're Mrs. New Guy,

05:16.204 --> 05:18.998
you keep those knees together, okay?
Staple them.

05:21.167 --> 05:23.252
I don't care
if you have to hop to the altar.

05:23.836 --> 05:26.589
God bless, honey. Who's next?

05:28.466 --> 05:30.843
- Hello, Daphne.
- Hello.

05:35.431 --> 05:37.266
Notice anything?

05:38.684 --> 05:41.854
Oh, yes. Don't you look dashing.

05:42.063 --> 05:43.689
Blue really is your colour.

05:45.274 --> 05:47.860
Hold still, though,
there's something on your lip.

05:52.531 --> 05:55.451
Oh, wait, it's some sort of hair.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.372
Actually, it's a moustache.

06:00.539 --> 06:05.753
Oh, yes, so it is.
Still a bit on the wispy side.

06:06.045 --> 06:09.340
Yeah, it puts me in mind
of me Grammy Moon.

06:10.174 --> 06:13.594
Or rather, it will do,
once it's grown in a bit.

06:16.096 --> 06:18.432
- Turn on the radio.
- Is something the matter?

06:18.641 --> 06:20.434
Just turn the radio on
to KACL, please.

06:21.143 --> 06:24.021
<i>Listen to me. You have a child.</i>

06:24.229 --> 06:25.939
<i>You think you have the right
to get divorced</i>

06:26.148 --> 06:27.858
<i>just because you're tired
of your husband?</i>

06:28.067 --> 06:29.568
<i>But he's gay.</i>

06:30.069 --> 06:33.030
<i>You picked him.
You made a baby with him.</i>

06:33.238 --> 06:34.239
<i>Maybe you got him drunk,</i>

06:34.448 --> 06:36.617
<i>maybe you dressed up
as Antonio Banderas, I don't care.</i>

06:36.825 --> 06:39.119
<i>Just make it work.</i>

06:39.328 --> 06:41.163
Well, that's a bit harsh.

06:41.371 --> 06:44.333
Please, this is a woman
who believes the Spanish Inquisition

06:44.541 --> 06:47.544
was just tough love for heretics.

06:49.129 --> 06:51.506
We were listening to her
while I was doing my exercises,

06:51.715 --> 06:53.884
- and I don't think she's so bad.
- Excuse me?

06:54.092 --> 06:57.387
Well, it's nice to have someone
stand up for old-fashioned values.

06:57.596 --> 07:00.724
Like sex. I mean, I'm no prude,
but in my day,

07:00.933 --> 07:04.353
sex was still something sacred
and mysterious.

07:04.561 --> 07:06.438
Nowadays, you can't even
turn on the television

07:06.647 --> 07:10.108
without hearing all this... stuff.

07:10.317 --> 07:14.446
Well, I think that explains
our 90-dollar cable bill this month.

07:20.786 --> 07:24.539
I liked her too.
She reminds me of my old mum.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.417
She'll point out
every little flaw you've got,

07:27.626 --> 07:30.462
remind you of every mistake
you ever made.

07:30.629 --> 07:32.756
Tell you you're lazy,
you'll never amount to anything

07:32.964 --> 07:34.925
and no good man will ever have you.

07:35.133 --> 07:38.678
But it's just because she loves you.

07:39.262 --> 07:42.307
In fact,
I think I'll give old Mum a call.

07:42.766 --> 07:45.060
You know, if you hate her so much,
why did you hire her?

07:45.268 --> 07:48.313
Well, I didn't know
she was going to behave this way.

07:48.521 --> 07:50.690
She said all the right things
at the interview.

07:50.899 --> 07:53.234
She certainly did.

07:53.443 --> 07:56.863
She complimented his clothes,
his looks,

07:57.071 --> 08:00.825
she even pretended to think
I was the older brother.

08:01.242 --> 08:04.579
Of course, the moustache may have
clouded her judgement on that.

08:09.542 --> 08:12.003
She has a moustache?

08:15.131 --> 08:19.260
Well, like it or not,
I am responsible for her being here.

08:19.469 --> 08:22.305
I'll just have to have a talk with her,
tell her to soften her approach

08:22.513 --> 08:24.140
before she alienates
her entire audience.

08:24.349 --> 08:25.516
People can tell the difference

08:25.725 --> 08:28.644
between constructive criticism
and outright abuse.

08:28.853 --> 08:31.230
No, Mum, me boyfriend
hasn't dumped me

08:31.439 --> 08:33.941
for someone prettier
and smarter yet.

08:34.609 --> 08:37.111
She's such an old tease.

08:42.658 --> 08:45.494
Until tomorrow, then,
this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

08:49.165 --> 08:50.750
Dr. Nora.

08:50.958 --> 08:53.711
Such a frosty tone.
Is something the matter?

08:53.919 --> 08:56.255
I have just one question for you.

08:56.464 --> 08:58.758
What kind of vicious,
judgemental, name-calling,

08:58.966 --> 09:01.719
machete-mouthed bitch are you?

09:04.764 --> 09:07.141
I was going
for the less feisty version.

09:07.349 --> 09:09.477
I heard what you said
to that single mother yesterday.

09:09.685 --> 09:11.854
For your information,
I happen to be a single mom too.

09:12.062 --> 09:14.899
That doesn't surprise me, after
watching you pounce on poor George

09:15.107 --> 09:16.734
like a Kodiak bear on a salmon.

09:16.942 --> 09:18.694
- That does it!
- Roz, Roz, stop it.

09:18.903 --> 09:20.696
I've got to talk to Dr. Nora
before her show.

09:20.905 --> 09:23.032
Just pencil in
the hair-pulling for later, all right?

09:23.240 --> 09:25.910
All right,
but this isn't over between us.

09:26.076 --> 09:28.746
If you want to,
I'll take this out on the street.

09:29.371 --> 09:32.166
That would hardly be fair.
You'd have the home-field advantage.

09:32.374 --> 09:35.836
Roz, Roz, Roz, get out. Out.

09:39.048 --> 09:41.467
Well, I don't even know
where to begin.

09:41.675 --> 09:43.927
Save it.
Whatever it is, I've already heard it.

09:44.136 --> 09:46.555
"Dr. Nora is mean.
Dr. Nora hurts people's feelings."

09:46.764 --> 09:48.307
Too bad.
I'm not here to coddle people.

09:48.515 --> 09:49.975
- I'm here to help them.
- Oh, really?

09:50.267 --> 09:52.936
And just how were you helping
that poor confused bisexual woman

09:53.145 --> 09:56.356
by calling her
an equal-opportunity slut?

09:57.691 --> 10:01.194
The worst thing about this is how you
misrepresented yourself to get this job.

10:01.403 --> 10:03.280
You're hardly one
to question my ethics.

10:03.488 --> 10:04.489
We both know you hired me

10:04.698 --> 10:06.742
because you hoped
I might sleep with you.

10:06.950 --> 10:10.287
- That thought never occurred to me.
- Now who's lying?

10:10.495 --> 10:11.955
You won't admit that,
like most men,

10:12.122 --> 10:14.207
you leave all major decisions
to your penis.

10:16.043 --> 10:18.587
Fortunately for Seattle,
your penis chose right.

10:18.795 --> 10:20.380
It just didn't know why.

10:22.299 --> 10:24.426
Yes, well, you're just forgetting
one thing, Dr. Nora.

10:24.634 --> 10:27.596
You are here on my recommendation.
You may consider it withdrawn.

10:28.221 --> 10:30.432
- Hey, Dr. Crane.
- Kenny, just the man I wanted to see.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.851
Dr. Nora. Don't hit me.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.936
I wanna talk about Dr. Nora's show.

10:35.145 --> 10:36.980
Get in line.
The switchboard's been going nuts.

10:37.188 --> 10:39.107
- I don't doubt it.
- They love you.

10:39.316 --> 10:40.525
Excuse me?

10:40.734 --> 10:43.486
Except for the ones that hate you.
Either way, they're listening.

10:43.695 --> 10:45.322
So you consider that option
picked up.

10:45.530 --> 10:47.115
- Ten seconds.
- Thank you, Kenny.

10:47.324 --> 10:49.159
Now get out of my booth.

10:49.743 --> 10:51.327
Yes, ma'am.

10:53.204 --> 10:54.789
Kenny.

10:54.998 --> 10:57.834
You can't be serious
about hiring that woman full-time.

10:58.042 --> 10:59.335
Putting that woman behind a mike

10:59.544 --> 11:01.588
is like putting Typhoid Mary
in a kissing booth.

11:01.796 --> 11:04.549
I'm sorry, doc. Ratings are ratings.

11:04.757 --> 11:06.134
<i>Hello, Dr. Nora.</i>

11:06.342 --> 11:08.887
<i>My name is Tom
and I have this co-worker</i>

11:09.095 --> 11:11.681
<i>who's really driving me up the wall.
What can I do about it?</i>

11:11.890 --> 11:16.185
Not a thing, Tom.
Not one damn thing.

11:23.443 --> 11:25.486
<i>Nothing I ever do
is good enough for her.</i>

11:25.695 --> 11:29.657
<i>I baked a cake for her birthday
and she said it tasted like sawdust.</i>

11:30.324 --> 11:31.492
<i>I know she's my mother,</i>

11:31.701 --> 11:34.662
<i>but sometimes
I just wanna shut her out of my life.</i>

11:34.871 --> 11:37.957
Oh, Denise,
burning bridges solves nothing.

11:38.166 --> 11:41.169
I'd like to suggest
that you seek family counselling

11:41.377 --> 11:43.796
to help you and your mother
get to the root of these issues,

11:44.005 --> 11:45.798
provided your mother
is willing to cooperate.

11:46.007 --> 11:48.134
If not, perhaps
individual counselling would help.

11:48.342 --> 11:50.678
Will you stay on the line
so Roz can give you some numbers?

11:50.887 --> 11:52.805
<i>Okay. Thank you, Dr. Crane.</i>

11:53.014 --> 11:54.724
It's my pleasure.

11:55.349 --> 11:59.979
Well, I see through the glass
that Dr. Nora either disagrees with me

12:00.187 --> 12:03.107
or has just eaten a bad clam.

12:07.028 --> 12:09.697
<i>I'm sure she'll tell us which
when the Dr. Nora Show begins,</i>

12:09.864 --> 12:13.117
right after this traffic report
from Chopper Dave.

12:16.245 --> 12:17.913
Okay, Denise,
I've got the numbers for you.

12:18.122 --> 12:20.082
- Do you have a pencil?
- Come on, Roz, hurry up.

12:20.291 --> 12:22.293
I wanna get out of here
before her trainer shows up

12:22.501 --> 12:25.462
with a bucket of live mice
for her pre-show feeding.

12:26.255 --> 12:29.466
I'm sorry to cut you off, Chopper Dave,
but we have a therapy emergency.

12:29.675 --> 12:31.510
<i>- Denise, are you still on?
- Yes.</i>

12:31.719 --> 12:33.178
- That's my caller.
- Denise.

12:33.345 --> 12:36.181
I want you to ignore everything
Dr. Crane just told you.

12:36.348 --> 12:37.933
I know more about mothers
than he does.

12:38.142 --> 12:40.978
And here is fact number one:
They don't change.

12:41.186 --> 12:42.521
Cut this woman out of your life.

12:42.730 --> 12:45.315
<i>- I don't believe this.
- You don't think that with counsel...?</i>

12:45.524 --> 12:47.025
When you have a tumour,
what do you do?

12:47.234 --> 12:51.196
Do you sit it down and say,
"Hey, tumour, let's get along, okay?"

12:51.405 --> 12:56.452
No, you take a knife and you cut it out.
Well, Denise, your mother is a tumour.

12:57.578 --> 13:00.497
My heart bleeds for you,
because I have been there.

13:00.706 --> 13:03.083
I know how hard it is to look
at your mother's face and say:

13:03.292 --> 13:07.629
"Bye-bye, you toxic harpy.
You're not hurting me again."

13:07.838 --> 13:09.214
But that is what you have to do.

13:09.423 --> 13:10.966
<i>I think maybe you're right.</i>

13:11.174 --> 13:12.342
I'm always right.

13:13.010 --> 13:14.553
And you know what else?

13:14.761 --> 13:19.016
I bet your cake was yummy.
God bless, honey.

13:19.474 --> 13:22.728
- Who's next?
- We have Frasier from here.

13:27.232 --> 13:29.734
How dare you ambush Denise
that way?

13:29.943 --> 13:30.986
Well, what a surprise.

13:31.194 --> 13:33.613
I dare to give one of Frasier's callers
a second opinion,

13:33.822 --> 13:34.906
and what does Frasier say?

13:38.952 --> 13:41.788
Yes, sound effects,
the therapist's best friend.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.957
You realize what you're doing
is unprofessional.

13:44.165 --> 13:46.418
Denise called my show.
She didn't ask for your opinion.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.671
And I didn't ask for yours.
Back to you, Chopper Dave.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.340
She just cut me off.

13:52.841 --> 13:54.175
All right, let's just settle this.

13:54.384 --> 13:56.886
We don't like each other,
but we're gonna have to coexist here.

13:57.095 --> 13:59.014
So why don't we agree
that I won't criticize you

13:59.222 --> 14:00.765
and you won't criticize me. Deal?

14:00.974 --> 14:02.350
- No.
- No?

14:02.517 --> 14:04.269
No, I will undermine you
every chance I get,

14:04.477 --> 14:06.563
because you, Dr. Crane,
are a dangerous man.

14:06.896 --> 14:08.731
- I'm dangerous?
- Yes.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.692
Seattle's great enabler.

14:10.900 --> 14:14.195
You tell tramps and fornicators
that their problem is low self-esteem.

14:14.404 --> 14:17.156
They should have low self-esteem.
They're going to hell.

14:20.577 --> 14:21.786
I take it back.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.080
You're not unprofessional,
you're a freaking loon.

14:24.539 --> 14:26.457
Five seconds.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.836
All right, if it's war you two want,
it's war you'll get.

14:30.128 --> 14:31.587
Right, Roz?

14:31.796 --> 14:34.674
You don't actually buy
all this no-sex stuff of hers, do you?

14:34.882 --> 14:38.803
- Yeah.
- Well, it's war!

14:44.559 --> 14:45.977
- Oh, hi, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.

14:46.185 --> 14:49.522
As you've probably noticed,
I shaved my moustache.

14:54.193 --> 14:57.822
I decided a better way to change
my look was to pump some iron.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.908
- So, what, you joined a gym?
- I certainly did.

15:01.409 --> 15:05.121
I start the minute my weight belt
gets back from the monogrammer's.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.083
Frasier, you free for dinner?

15:09.250 --> 15:10.876
Well, I suppose so, yes.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.087
Hey, look who I bumped into
in the elevator.

15:13.295 --> 15:14.296
- Roz.
- Hey, Roz.

15:14.505 --> 15:17.174
I've been on the phone all day
digging up dirt on Dr. Nora,

15:17.383 --> 15:19.844
- and you will not believe what I found.
- Really?

15:20.052 --> 15:23.013
I called the station where she worked
and they couldn't wait to dish her.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.765
For starters,
she has no medical degree.

15:24.974 --> 15:28.352
Her doctorate
is in Physical Education.

15:28.561 --> 15:32.398
She's a gym teacher.

15:32.940 --> 15:35.859
Wouldn't wanna be the chubby kid
in that gym class.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.946
Or the boy
in the monogrammed weight belt.

15:42.324 --> 15:44.284
Well, this is just dynamite, Roz.

15:44.493 --> 15:46.996
Oh, that's not even half of it.
Her name isn't Fairchild.

15:47.204 --> 15:48.288
She was born Mulhern.

15:48.497 --> 15:51.667
And Little Miss Family-Values
has two divorces behind her

15:51.875 --> 15:53.544
and an affair with a married man.

15:53.752 --> 15:56.338
Tomorrow, I am going to drop
this little bombshell

15:56.547 --> 15:58.632
to start my show and end hers.

15:58.841 --> 16:00.425
You know, Fras,
when I was on the force,

16:00.634 --> 16:02.761
I went through a feud like this
with Charlie Drucker,

16:02.970 --> 16:04.304
and believe me, it's not worth it.

16:04.513 --> 16:06.765
I started out by making a joke
about his chest.

16:06.974 --> 16:07.975
- His chest?
- Yeah.

16:08.183 --> 16:13.897
He was, like, a heavyset guy and
he had those, you know, man bosoms.

16:14.940 --> 16:17.401
So he heard about it
and he got mad at me

16:17.609 --> 16:19.778
and he wrote something about me
on the men's room wall,

16:19.987 --> 16:22.364
and I should have just called it quits
right there and then,

16:22.572 --> 16:26.034
but his name being Drucker
brought out the poet in me.

16:26.827 --> 16:28.286
And it just got worse and worse,

16:28.495 --> 16:30.288
and we both ended up
looking like idiots.

16:30.497 --> 16:33.875
I don't intend to get into a feud with
her, I just wanna get her off the air.

16:34.084 --> 16:37.170
But if you attack her like that,
aren't you just descending to her level?

16:37.379 --> 16:38.755
You know, Roz, maybe they're right.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.007
Look at what this woman
has reduced me to already:

16:41.216 --> 16:45.512
Trading barbs, yelling over the air.
Now I'm spreading rumours about her.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.431
Is that any way for a psychiatrist
to deal with conflict?

16:48.640 --> 16:49.724
Don't you wimp out on me.

16:49.933 --> 16:52.310
Now, Roz, just think about it.
There may be a better way.

16:52.519 --> 16:56.523
You know what, Dr. Nora is clearly
a damaged and angry woman.

16:56.731 --> 16:58.525
Maybe I could find out

16:58.733 --> 17:01.194
what's at the root of that anger
and help her,

17:01.403 --> 17:04.614
also proving that my method of therapy
is the more valid one.

17:04.823 --> 17:08.242
Why are you doing this to me?
Look, if you have a tumour...

17:08.451 --> 17:10.244
Roz, stop it!

17:11.663 --> 17:14.665
If you wanna analyse her, you might
start with that whole mother thing.

17:14.874 --> 17:17.710
I caught her show yesterday.
That seemed to be a hot-button issue.

17:17.877 --> 17:20.255
Yes, it did, didn't it?
They've been estranged for years.

17:20.463 --> 17:21.964
Perhaps we could find the woman

17:22.173 --> 17:24.133
and discover
what caused this rift between them.

17:24.342 --> 17:27.804
- Maybe even effect a reconciliation.
- Of course, it won't be easy.

17:28.012 --> 17:30.056
We don't even know
if the woman's still alive.

17:30.265 --> 17:32.684
Yes, all sorts of things could happen
to a woman her age.

17:32.892 --> 17:34.936
Her mother could've had
a heart attack or a stroke.

17:35.144 --> 17:36.187
Exactly.

17:36.396 --> 17:39.440
She could be hit by a bus
as she's coming out of the pub,

17:39.649 --> 17:42.527
or fall asleep smoking a cigarette

17:42.735 --> 17:45.947
and be burned to a crisp
right there in her smelly bed.

17:47.615 --> 17:51.577
Or she could fall off a ferry
and be pulled down under the water,

17:51.786 --> 17:54.747
the roar of the waves drowning out
her cries for help,

17:54.956 --> 17:59.418
until no one could hear that shrill voice
of hers, not ever again.

17:59.627 --> 18:02.672
Well, I'm all done with me darks.

18:06.676 --> 18:07.885
Listen to me.

18:08.094 --> 18:11.764
You should be shunning this woman,
not rewarding her with gifts.

18:11.973 --> 18:16.644
A baby shower for an unwed mother.
Now I've heard it all. Who's next?

18:16.852 --> 18:18.396
Roz. Did her mother get here all right?

18:18.604 --> 18:19.980
Yes, but I'm begging you,

18:20.189 --> 18:23.109
we could drive a stake
through that thing's heart right now!

18:23.317 --> 18:26.570
Roz, please, trust me.
My way is better. Get in there.

18:27.863 --> 18:31.534
Mrs. Mulhern, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

18:31.742 --> 18:35.829
Dr. Crane, I can't thank you enough
for finding me and bringing me here.

18:36.038 --> 18:39.458
Well, I was so moved by your story,
it's a joy to do this for you.

18:39.667 --> 18:42.586
For 20 years,
I've wondered where my little girl was

18:42.795 --> 18:44.004
and if I'd ever see her again.

18:44.213 --> 18:46.048
What did you two fight about
to begin with?

18:46.256 --> 18:47.299
Oh, I blame myself.

18:47.508 --> 18:50.427
I thought the man she wanted to marry
wasn't good enough for her.

18:50.636 --> 18:54.515
So she eloped, and I've been so afraid
the emphysema would finish me

18:54.723 --> 18:57.476
before I could ask her forgiveness
and tell her I love her.

18:57.935 --> 19:01.355
Well, tell her you shall.

19:01.563 --> 19:03.440
Roz?

19:04.483 --> 19:06.860
Forget couples therapy, Allison.
He is a loser.

19:07.069 --> 19:08.362
If you don't drop him right now,

19:08.570 --> 19:10.656
you deserve every bit of misery
that you get.

19:10.864 --> 19:12.991
God bless, honey. Who's next?

19:13.200 --> 19:15.285
We have Frasier Crane on line one.

19:16.620 --> 19:19.289
Frasier, you wanna yell at me
for that last call?

19:19.498 --> 19:22.084
No, although I do believe
that a gifted therapist

19:22.292 --> 19:24.002
can help two people
put aside their anger

19:24.211 --> 19:25.963
and heal the differences
between them.

19:29.675 --> 19:31.259
I have someone here with me today.

19:31.468 --> 19:34.388
Someone you haven't seen
for quite a while.

19:34.846 --> 19:36.515
There's something
she'd like to tell you.

19:36.723 --> 19:41.895
Something she's wanted to tell you
for a very long, long time.

19:42.104 --> 19:44.022
Mrs. Mulhern?

19:44.231 --> 19:46.149
You little whore!

19:48.610 --> 19:49.611
Mother!

19:49.819 --> 19:51.863
So you thought you could get away
from me, did you?

19:52.072 --> 19:54.324
Thought you could leave me
to rot in that dump

19:54.532 --> 19:57.202
without barely enough cash
for a bottle of Mateus.

19:57.369 --> 19:59.329
You'll pay for that, missy.

19:59.537 --> 20:02.374
I was wrong, Frasier.
Your way is better.

20:03.416 --> 20:06.169
- Mrs. Mulhern!
- Keep out of this!

20:06.378 --> 20:09.297
- Mother, please, I am doing my show.
- Yes.

20:09.506 --> 20:11.966
You're Little Miss Perfect now,
aren't you?

20:12.175 --> 20:14.386
Telling everybody else
how wicked they are.

20:14.594 --> 20:16.471
They should hear about your past.

20:16.679 --> 20:18.890
Mrs. Mulhern, please.

20:20.183 --> 20:23.853
The shame you brought on me,
you ungrateful tramp.

20:24.437 --> 20:27.774
Please, I'm a good girl now.

20:27.982 --> 20:32.695
How you were paid. Paid to leave town
by that nice boy's family.

20:32.904 --> 20:34.781
For God's sake, Nora,
go to commercial.

20:34.989 --> 20:36.824
There, Seattle,
now you know what I mean

20:37.033 --> 20:39.369
when I say there's people
you just don't need in your life.

20:39.577 --> 20:42.121
- Help me out, George.
- What do they pay you here?

20:42.330 --> 20:44.082
I want my cut.

20:44.290 --> 20:47.752
I knew that you hated me, but I just
can't believe you could be so cruel.

20:47.960 --> 20:51.005
I was trying to help.
She seemed delightful on the phone.

20:51.214 --> 20:54.258
I want $50 right now.

20:54.717 --> 20:58.012
How many times will I have to move
before I'm finally free of her?

20:58.221 --> 20:59.889
Nora, I'm sorry.

21:01.015 --> 21:04.060
- You owe me, missy. I gave you life.
- Mrs. Mulhern.

21:04.268 --> 21:06.062
How could you?

21:08.439 --> 21:10.399
Frasier, we've got dead air.

21:12.151 --> 21:14.820
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

21:15.029 --> 21:19.408
I'm sure Dr. Nora's listeners join me
in hoping that she and her mother

21:19.617 --> 21:21.410
can resolve
these differences very soon.

21:21.661 --> 21:24.747
They're off to a bit of a bumpy start...

21:27.083 --> 21:30.252
...but at least
the lines of communication are open.
