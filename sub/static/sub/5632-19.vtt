WEBVTT

00:02.723 --> 00:04.657
Wow, Hurricane Brennan,
tearing through the house

00:04.692 --> 00:06.126
early in the morning.

00:06.160 --> 00:07.994
I thought we were supposed
to be organizing it.

00:08.028 --> 00:10.296
Yes, and in order to do
that properly, we must

00:10.331 --> 00:11.865
sort through all of our possessions,

00:11.899 --> 00:13.533
purge everything we can,

00:13.567 --> 00:15.468
and keep only what we need.

00:15.503 --> 00:18.238
Oh, no way. You got to be kidding me.

00:18.272 --> 00:19.839
No way, the Cocky belt buckle stays.

00:19.874 --> 00:21.574
Booth, you haven't worn that in years.

00:21.609 --> 00:25.044
A Decluttering Handbook,

00:25.079 --> 00:27.413
Fay Wolf says, "If you don't use it

00:27.448 --> 00:28.715
and/or love it,

00:28.749 --> 00:29.749
you must let go of it."

00:29.784 --> 00:30.750
Well, Fay Wolf is out, okay?

00:30.785 --> 00:32.418
But the Cocky belt buckle stays.

00:32.453 --> 00:34.387
Ain't going anywhere. You know what?

00:34.421 --> 00:36.589
- You can get rid of these things.
- No, no. Booth, Booth, Booth!

00:36.624 --> 00:40.493
Booth, Booth, those are extremely rare

00:40.528 --> 00:42.862
African fertility river stones.

00:42.897 --> 00:43.930
We already have two
beautiful kids together;

00:43.964 --> 00:45.098
we don't need it.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.599
Well, speaking of things
we can get rid of...

00:46.634 --> 00:47.901
- No way! Are you kid...
- This beer hat.

00:47.935 --> 00:49.202
- Now, that's not happening.
- Booth, Booth!

00:49.236 --> 00:51.037
- Aha!
- Booth!

00:51.071 --> 00:52.639
We're not making any progress,

00:52.673 --> 00:54.574
Hank and Christine are getting big fast,

00:54.608 --> 00:56.109
and we agreed to make space.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.811
Beer hat stays, and the Cocky belt buckle,

00:57.845 --> 00:59.612
- Ugh.
- and you can keep those weird stones.

00:59.647 --> 01:02.315
Fine, as long as we do something
with that pile of socks.

01:02.349 --> 01:04.184
What?

01:04.218 --> 01:05.585
No.

01:05.619 --> 01:06.853
No way, these are my socks.

01:06.887 --> 01:08.321
No way.

01:08.355 --> 01:10.323
Booth, I know they're your way

01:10.357 --> 01:11.691
of keeping your individuality at the FBI,

01:11.725 --> 01:12.992
but you don't need a hundred pairs.

01:13.027 --> 01:14.394
I do need a hundred pairs.

01:14.428 --> 01:16.596
I wear these socks, I
actually put them on my feet.

01:16.630 --> 01:18.765
You know, unlike you with those books.

01:18.799 --> 01:20.900
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, all those books over there.

01:20.935 --> 01:22.402
Look at all those books.

01:22.436 --> 01:24.637
Books are educational,
aesthetically pleasing,

01:24.672 --> 01:26.639
and great to have around children.

01:26.674 --> 01:28.708
But you already read
them. Get rid of them.

01:28.742 --> 01:29.809
You don't get rid of books, Booth.

01:29.844 --> 01:30.722
Ah.

01:30.723 --> 01:31.609
That's crazy.

01:31.612 --> 01:34.280
Oh, okay, lab confirms that
you got to get rid of the books.

01:35.416 --> 01:37.417
We also have a dead body, so...

01:41.856 --> 01:43.456
Yeah! Eat that there, Oliver.

01:43.490 --> 01:44.457
You like that, huh?

01:44.491 --> 01:45.625
You like how that tastes?

01:45.659 --> 01:47.160
Want to eat a little bit more?

01:47.194 --> 01:48.995
I will be doing no eating of any kind.

01:49.029 --> 01:51.264
You, on the other hand, will
be eating whatever I'm serving.

01:51.298 --> 01:52.799
Hey, don't do... no, no, Oliver, stop!

01:52.833 --> 01:54.334
Come on, man, you can't do that.

01:54.368 --> 01:56.603
You can't do multiple
boosters, it's not fair.

01:56.637 --> 01:58.671
- Your face isn't fair.
- That doesn't even make sense.

01:58.706 --> 01:59.772
Your face doesn't make sense.

01:59.807 --> 02:00.807
Your face doesn't.

02:00.841 --> 02:01.808
Your face doesn't.

02:01.842 --> 02:03.409
Your face doesn't.

02:03.444 --> 02:05.879
Your face is so big that it
creates non-Euclidian triangles

02:05.913 --> 02:07.313
of over 180 degrees around it.

02:07.348 --> 02:08.314
Is that right? Really?

02:08.348 --> 02:09.282
- Yeah.
- Really?

02:09.316 --> 02:10.883
Okay, well, your face is so expansive

02:10.918 --> 02:12.151
that the lensing effect is such

02:12.186 --> 02:14.487
that a light passing within

02:14.521 --> 02:16.055
one Astronomical Unit
has a radius of curvature

02:16.090 --> 02:17.624
- of six E to the ninth meter.
- Ooh.

02:17.658 --> 02:18.958
Am I interrupting?

02:18.993 --> 02:19.959
- Yes.
- Yes.

02:19.994 --> 02:21.160
Well, too bad.

02:21.195 --> 02:22.896
A body from the Anacostia
River just came in.

02:22.930 --> 02:24.497
Oh!

02:24.531 --> 02:26.900
Yes! I will eat whatever you can dish out,

02:26.934 --> 02:28.167
24 hours a day, good sir.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.248
You cheated.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.316
You like cheating, yeah?

02:30.351 --> 02:31.384
You, do you?

02:31.418 --> 02:32.719
You feel good when you cheat, cheater?

02:32.753 --> 02:33.720
Guys! Now.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.954
I want a rematch, cheater.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.389
And I will consider giving you one.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.890
- I'm sorry, consider?
- Guys.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.727
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.434
Based on the femoral heads

02:48.469 --> 02:50.770
and the auricular surfaces of the ilia,

02:50.804 --> 02:54.140
the victim was a white male in his 30s.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.143
A white male in his 30s who
suffered massive injuries.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.312
There are fractures on
his clavicle, his ribs,

02:59.346 --> 03:00.713
his anterior tibial crest,

03:00.748 --> 03:02.515
multiple foot fractures,

03:02.549 --> 03:04.017
including the calcaneus, the talus,

03:04.051 --> 03:05.785
the metatarsals, and the phalanges.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.353
Well, maybe he cheated at video games,

03:07.388 --> 03:08.888
so his friend threw him off a cliff.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.124
Or he was simply so depressed
at being such a sore loser,

03:11.158 --> 03:15.695
- that he jumped.
- Those hypotheses are juvenile

03:15.729 --> 03:17.230
and not rooted in facts.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.032
Dr. Wells, please determine

03:19.066 --> 03:22.535
which injuries are postmortem
and which are perimortem.

03:22.569 --> 03:23.970
Already on it.

03:24.004 --> 03:27.140
Okay, I am seeing evidence
of dislocated shoulders,

03:27.174 --> 03:28.741
sprains to the hips, knees and groin,

03:28.776 --> 03:31.044
wrist strains, and abdominal tears,

03:31.078 --> 03:33.713
and that's just from the
tissue that I have to work with.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.049
Well, the fish definitely made
a few nibbles here and there,

03:36.083 --> 03:37.917
but I think most of the damage I'm seeing

03:37.951 --> 03:39.685
is done by Chelydra serpentina.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.922
That would be the eastern
snapping turtle, loser.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.425
Yeah, that's what I said, cheater.

03:45.459 --> 03:48.628
Based on the lack of intestinal bloating

03:48.662 --> 03:50.797
and the degree of early skin slippage,

03:50.831 --> 03:53.833
the body's been in the
river about 12 to 15 hours.

03:53.867 --> 03:54.967
That means he was dumped there

03:55.002 --> 03:56.702
between 9:00 and midnight last night.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.871
The lack of hemorrhagic
staining around the margins

03:58.906 --> 04:02.975
indicates the decapitation
was very likely postmortem

04:03.010 --> 04:04.410
and not cause of death.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.913
Uh, yeah, it was definitely postmortem.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.315
And this is a violent cut,

04:09.349 --> 04:11.050
done with tremendous force.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.286
Maybe it was ritualistic.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.654
Perhaps done with a sword.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.122
Uh, no.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.656
No, it was not a sword.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.791
It was definitely a curved weapon

04:19.827 --> 04:22.295
spinning really, really fast.

04:22.329 --> 04:25.465
What do you know that we don't?

04:25.499 --> 04:27.667
So I did a comprehensive tag search

04:27.701 --> 04:30.870
for "Anacostia," "body,"
"head," and "decapitation,"

04:30.904 --> 04:32.972
and this is the viral video

04:33.006 --> 04:34.140
that I came up with.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.275
Wow. Over 200,000 hits.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.844
In less than an hour.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.813
Oh, that's on the Anacostia,
near where the body was found.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.316
Ten beers and zero fish, baby!

04:43.350 --> 04:45.518
Yeah, yeah!

04:45.552 --> 04:47.420
Holy crap, Doc,

04:47.454 --> 04:48.821
is that a dead body?

04:48.856 --> 04:50.656
No, I don't think so, bro.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.891
Doc, I think it's real.

04:51.925 --> 04:52.925
I think it's a mannequin.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.227
Oh, I don't know, Doc,

04:54.261 --> 04:55.394
I'm thinking it's real.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.696
Angela, perhaps you can

04:56.730 --> 04:57.697
fast-forward through this part.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.698
Yeah.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.134
Jumping ahead five minutes.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.435
I don't think it's real, bro.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.703
But what if it is, Doc?

05:03.737 --> 05:04.770
Oh, it can't be...

05:04.805 --> 05:06.339
Maybe a few minutes more.

05:06.373 --> 05:08.875
But what if it is? What if it...

05:08.909 --> 05:10.643
All right, all right,
fine. What if it is, Goheen?

05:10.677 --> 05:12.378
- What are we gonna do, huh?
- I don't know, I don't know...

05:12.412 --> 05:14.714
Angela, skip to the end of the video.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.983
Yeah. Right.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.317
Holy crap, Doc,

05:18.352 --> 05:19.519
it is a dead body!

05:19.553 --> 05:20.720
Look how gross it is.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.355
- Oh!
- Let it be known,

05:22.389 --> 05:24.390
on this day, Thursday 9:00 a.m.,

05:24.424 --> 05:27.360
I, Nathan Goheen, and
my friend, Jeff Dockerty,

05:27.394 --> 05:29.662
found this dead body!

05:29.696 --> 05:31.397
Oh, Doc, should we alert the mayor?

05:31.431 --> 05:33.332
We got to tell the mayor, dude.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.035
No, Doc!

05:36.069 --> 05:38.171
Holy crap, you cut off his head, Doc!

05:38.205 --> 05:39.939
Unbelievable.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.207
Angela, one more thing...

05:41.241 --> 05:42.742
I know, I've already
tagged the coordinates

05:42.776 --> 05:44.210
and pinpointed the location.

05:44.244 --> 05:47.947
No, please press the thumbs up button.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.449
I find imbeciles amusing.

- Synced and corrected by chamallow -

06:22.502 --> 06:23.902
Based on the remodeling,

06:23.903 --> 06:26.004
I categorized the victim's injuries,

06:26.038 --> 06:28.940
and only a few of the
fractures occurred postmortem.

06:28.974 --> 06:30.942
Caused by the rocks in the river?

06:30.976 --> 06:32.010
Precisely.

06:32.044 --> 06:33.478
However, almost all of the other injuries

06:33.512 --> 06:34.913
were sustained gradually

06:34.947 --> 06:36.347
over the past 17 years.

06:36.382 --> 06:38.616
That's a long time to be
getting repeatedly injured.

06:38.651 --> 06:40.952
Maybe he had a high-risk occupation.

06:40.986 --> 06:42.120
Like an MMA fighter.

06:42.154 --> 06:43.421
Ooh, or a rodeo clown.

06:43.456 --> 06:46.124
Or maybe he just got
in a lot of bar fights.

06:46.158 --> 06:47.759
No, actually, he wasn't a drinker.

06:47.793 --> 06:49.260
According to his tox screen?

06:49.295 --> 06:52.097
Yeah, he had no alcohol
or drugs in his system.

06:52.131 --> 06:53.364
He was in tip-top shape.

06:53.399 --> 06:55.366
The last thing he ate was a protein bar.

06:55.401 --> 06:56.367
Hey.

06:56.402 --> 06:58.136
- Hey, so you got an I.D.?
- No.

06:58.170 --> 06:59.237
I don't have one.

06:59.271 --> 07:00.271
You don't have one?

07:00.306 --> 07:03.241
I don't have any fingerprints, implants,

07:03.275 --> 07:05.910
or surgical replacements
of any kind to work with.

07:05.945 --> 07:07.345
Oh, and I don't have a head.

07:07.379 --> 07:08.513
You have the victim's sex,

07:08.547 --> 07:10.582
his height, his weight,
and his hair color.

07:10.616 --> 07:14.385
Yeah, that narrowed it down
to a whopping 29,000 people.

07:18.724 --> 07:20.158
- Booth.
- Hey, Bones. Look at that, huh?

07:20.192 --> 07:21.826
Look what I got you.

07:22.962 --> 07:24.262
What is this?

07:24.296 --> 07:25.864
That's an e-reader.

07:25.898 --> 07:27.866
You can download thousands
of books, and you know what?

07:27.900 --> 07:29.834
It's thinner than a single hardcover.

07:29.869 --> 07:31.536
I know what an e-reader is.

07:31.570 --> 07:33.638
Told you, if she wanted
one, she'd already have it.

07:33.672 --> 07:35.640
- Order something, Aubrey.
- Don't have to tell me twice.

07:35.674 --> 07:37.909
Booth, I like reading
actual, physical books.

07:37.943 --> 07:40.245
Which I'll never understand.

07:40.279 --> 07:41.379
Plus, a lot of the books I have

07:41.413 --> 07:42.914
are too rare to upload onto an e-reader.

07:42.948 --> 07:44.916
No problem, no problem.
I will just return that.

07:44.950 --> 07:46.518
- That's no big deal.
- Ready to order?

07:46.552 --> 07:48.253
Uh, yeah, let me get
a burger, medium-well,

07:48.287 --> 07:49.654
and, uh, that's it.

07:49.688 --> 07:51.723
Actually, let me add some
fries to that, extra crispy,

07:51.757 --> 07:54.425
and a side of that fruit
salad; chocolate milk. Thanks.

07:54.460 --> 07:55.660
Are you sure that's it?

07:55.694 --> 07:57.862
Uh, you're right... and...
and some onion rings, too?

07:57.897 --> 07:58.863
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

07:58.898 --> 08:00.465
So, we didn't have any luck

08:00.499 --> 08:02.500
cross-referencing the victim's injuries

08:02.535 --> 08:05.036
to hospitals, so either
he lived out of town

08:05.070 --> 08:06.504
or he traveled a lot.

08:06.539 --> 08:08.473
Perhaps we should widen
the search geographically.

08:08.507 --> 08:10.909
I mean, his list of
injuries is quite extensive.

08:10.943 --> 08:13.745
Fractured foot bones in '04,

08:13.779 --> 08:15.180
broken collarbone in '08,

08:15.214 --> 08:17.348
broken wrist in 2011.

08:17.383 --> 08:18.416
Hold on.

08:18.450 --> 08:20.552
Is this guy... what, is he six-two,

08:20.586 --> 08:22.020
220, brown hair, athletic?

08:22.054 --> 08:23.488
That's correct.

08:23.522 --> 08:25.423
- I think I know who this is.
- What? No way.

08:26.559 --> 08:27.692
Did he break his ribs last year?

08:27.726 --> 08:29.394
Yes. Wha... how could
you possibly know that?

08:29.428 --> 08:30.695
Well, because his injuries

08:30.729 --> 08:33.431
are really well-known, at least to me.

08:33.465 --> 08:36.134
We're talking about seven-time
all-star hockey great Seth Lang.

08:36.902 --> 08:37.936
The Seth Lang.

08:40.806 --> 08:42.273
Hey.

08:42.368 --> 08:45.637
Booth I.D.'d the victim as a
hockey player named Seth Lang.

08:45.671 --> 08:48.773
Last seen by multiple
teammates around 10:30 p.m.

08:48.807 --> 08:51.142
So, if the body was dumped
between 9:00 and midnight...

08:51.176 --> 08:53.611
We have a 90-minute
window for time of death.

08:53.646 --> 08:55.213
90 minutes.

08:55.247 --> 08:56.547
Good job, Cam.

08:56.582 --> 08:57.982
That's really,

08:58.017 --> 08:59.717
really amazing stuff.

08:59.752 --> 09:02.253
Okay, what's going on?

09:02.288 --> 09:04.455
You are being way too polite

09:04.490 --> 09:06.090
and you're clearly in
the middle of something.

09:06.125 --> 09:08.393
Oh, this?

09:08.427 --> 09:09.928
Oh, I'm so glad that you mentioned this.

09:09.962 --> 09:11.229
This is actually my plan

09:11.263 --> 09:14.032
to track down the victim's missing head.

09:14.066 --> 09:16.200
But our search team's already on it.

09:16.235 --> 09:18.303
Yeah, a search team that's
in a single boat, Cam.

09:18.337 --> 09:20.004
And they're just, like, randomly

09:20.039 --> 09:21.673
floating on the Anacostia
looking for a head.

09:21.707 --> 09:23.541
I mean, that's like
throwing darts in the wind.

09:23.575 --> 09:24.609
They're not gonna find it.

09:24.643 --> 09:25.610
And you can?

09:25.644 --> 09:27.211
Come see.

09:27.246 --> 09:31.683
We know that the head is
between five and 5.9 kilograms,

09:31.717 --> 09:33.217
which would be visible at water level.

09:33.252 --> 09:34.385
Okay, I'm listening.

09:34.420 --> 09:36.054
So, tidal currents in the Anacostia

09:36.088 --> 09:37.822
are moving no faster
than two knots, right?

09:37.856 --> 09:39.791
So, if you take three hours,

09:39.825 --> 09:41.859
which is six nautical miles
from the point of separation...

09:41.894 --> 09:43.328
Bottom line, Dr. Hodgins.

09:43.362 --> 09:44.329
Right, bottom line.

09:44.363 --> 09:45.730
Bottom line is that the head

09:45.764 --> 09:47.598
would be in this section of the Anacostia,

09:47.633 --> 09:51.035
potentially drifting downstream
at two knots, as we speak.

09:51.070 --> 09:53.237
Okay, and what are those?

09:53.272 --> 09:54.572
Oh, those.

09:54.606 --> 09:59.510
Now, those are blueprints
for souped-up drones.

09:59.545 --> 10:00.778
How souped-up are we talking?

10:00.813 --> 10:04.182
You know, high-speed satellite cameras,

10:04.216 --> 10:05.583
video and audio capabilities,

10:05.617 --> 10:07.285
ooh, and retractable claws.

10:08.119 --> 10:09.920
Remember when you were
a kid? The claw game?

10:09.954 --> 10:11.755
Where you, you know, try
and win some stuffed animals?

10:11.790 --> 10:12.987
I remember those games.

10:13.092 --> 10:16.160
So imagine that, but a
hundred times stronger.

10:16.195 --> 10:17.728
They're already using
these just outside Shanghai

10:17.763 --> 10:18.963
to deliver packages.

10:18.997 --> 10:20.698
But, instead of packages,

10:20.732 --> 10:23.601
you'd be picking up a decapitated head.

10:23.635 --> 10:24.635
Exactly.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.674
So, the fractures

10:29.708 --> 10:32.910
on the calcaneus and
cuboid of the right foot...

10:32.945 --> 10:34.579
Well, you know, sometimes hockey players

10:34.613 --> 10:36.180
block shots with their
feet, but, you know, skates,

10:36.215 --> 10:37.782
they can only protect so much.

10:37.816 --> 10:39.250
- And the broken ribs?
- Well, there's cross-checking.

10:39.284 --> 10:41.085
I mean, being slammed into the boards,

10:41.120 --> 10:43.254
not to mention all the fighting
that there is in hockey.

10:43.288 --> 10:44.589
This is very useful, Booth.

10:44.623 --> 10:45.890
You're practically an intern on the case.

10:45.924 --> 10:47.258
All right, stop.

10:47.292 --> 10:48.960
Not an intern, don't call me an intern,

10:48.994 --> 10:50.561
don't even think about
calling me a squint, all right?

10:50.596 --> 10:52.296
I just happen to know a
little bit about hockey.

10:52.331 --> 10:54.132
And what do you know
about this Katie Stober

10:54.166 --> 10:55.833
we're going to meet?

10:55.868 --> 10:58.669
Not much, I mean, except
she's the widowed trophy wife

10:58.704 --> 11:00.705
of the last owner, Jerry Stober.

11:00.739 --> 11:02.540
- So she inherited the team.
- Mm-hmm.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.842
Well, I imagine an asset like
that comes with a lot of perks.

11:04.877 --> 11:06.244
Yeah, but anything
that valuable, you know,

11:06.278 --> 11:07.912
comes with enemies, too.

11:11.383 --> 11:12.750
Katie Stober? FBI.

11:12.784 --> 11:14.585
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.587
- This here...
- I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan.

11:16.622 --> 11:18.022
Hi. Yes, I heard you.

11:18.056 --> 11:19.023
Just... just one second.

11:19.057 --> 11:20.925
Oh, there it is.

11:20.959 --> 11:23.194
Sorry, I just...

11:23.228 --> 11:25.196
Ah...

11:25.230 --> 11:27.798
Lang's death has been really overwhelming.

11:27.833 --> 11:30.268
- Is this a bad time, Mrs. Stober?
- I...

11:30.302 --> 11:32.270
No. Look, I'm a new team owner.

11:32.304 --> 11:34.839
Just... a lot of pressure from the media

11:34.873 --> 11:36.240
and corporate sponsors and the fans.

11:36.275 --> 11:38.242
Jerry died last year,

11:38.277 --> 11:41.646
and so I'm just in a little
over my head with everything.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.248
No, that's... that's...
that's understandable.

11:44.283 --> 11:45.416
So when was the last time you saw Lang?

11:45.450 --> 11:47.251
It's hard to say exactly.

11:47.286 --> 11:49.453
Uh, we met, you know,
often throughout the season.

11:49.488 --> 11:50.855
How often?

11:50.889 --> 11:53.090
Did the two of you have
a romantic relationship?

11:53.125 --> 11:55.459
God, no. Lang was our only all-star,

11:55.494 --> 11:57.862
so meetings with him were really
about catering to his needs.

11:57.896 --> 11:59.297
So what was the relationship like

11:59.331 --> 12:01.432
between Lang and his
teammates and the staff?

12:01.466 --> 12:03.768
Uh, you'd have to ask the head coach.

12:03.802 --> 12:05.903
Jeremy Roenick?

12:05.938 --> 12:07.271
Yes. Yeah, he's down
at the rink right now.

12:07.306 --> 12:09.106
- Who is Jeremy Roenick?
- JR!

12:09.141 --> 12:11.909
Jeremy Roenick played 18 years
as a pro, 500 goals scored.

12:11.944 --> 12:13.611
He's a hockey legend.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.746
We'll head down and we'll
ask him some questions.

12:15.781 --> 12:17.348
You know, they... they're just
finishing up practice right now,

12:17.382 --> 12:19.150
so you'd have to wait a
little bit unless you want

12:19.184 --> 12:21.319
to throw on some skates and
go talk to him out on the ice.

12:55.887 --> 12:57.855
- Good job today, boys.
- Hey, Coach. Sorry to bother you.

12:57.889 --> 12:59.323
FBI. Special Agent Seeley Booth here.

12:59.358 --> 13:01.926
Yeah, I heard you had
some questions for me.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.861
Hey, good job, Fields.
Good job today, bud.

13:03.895 --> 13:05.496
Yeah, just curious if, uh, I don't know,

13:05.530 --> 13:06.931
any of your players or
staff had, uh, any problems

13:06.965 --> 13:08.532
with, um, Seth Lang.

13:08.567 --> 13:10.368
No, you'd be crazy to
have a beef with Lang.

13:10.402 --> 13:11.902
He was, like, the face of our team.

13:11.937 --> 13:14.972
Although there was Poppleton.

13:15.007 --> 13:17.375
Drew Poppleton, the defenseman?
Wait, wait, your enforcer?

13:17.409 --> 13:19.143
Yeah, he was kind of
Lang's personal bodyguard.

13:19.177 --> 13:20.978
Right, why'd he have a beef with him?

13:21.013 --> 13:22.747
Well, he wasn't actually our best player.

13:22.781 --> 13:24.015
Lang thought he slowed us down,

13:24.049 --> 13:25.182
so he asked me to get rid of him.

13:25.217 --> 13:27.151
Uh, that's good to know.

13:27.185 --> 13:29.987
- Yeah, yeah.
- What's going on, boys? What's happening?

13:30.022 --> 13:32.323
I bet Berkstresser he couldn't
hit the post from 20 feet out.

13:32.357 --> 13:33.991
I'm taking he didn't do that, huh?

13:34.026 --> 13:35.593
Whatever. Good luck collecting.

13:35.627 --> 13:37.428
Oh, so it's like that, huh?

13:37.462 --> 13:38.863
Double or nothing.

13:38.897 --> 13:41.799
$500 here says the suit
can hit it in one shot.

13:41.833 --> 13:44.802
Wait a second, guys. 500 bucks?
I don't even know you guys.

13:44.836 --> 13:46.070
Exactly, that's how bad he sucks.

13:46.104 --> 13:48.139
- Yeah, yeah, keep it up, tough guy.
- Wow.

13:48.173 --> 13:50.041
- You play?
- Yeah, I mean, I play.

13:50.075 --> 13:52.143
Yeah, sure, I... I played, I mean...

13:52.177 --> 13:53.811
All right, you're on.

13:55.847 --> 13:59.016
Okay, this should be interesting, huh?

13:59.051 --> 14:01.419
One shot, double or nothing.

14:01.453 --> 14:03.721
Let's do it, suit.

14:03.755 --> 14:05.156
I don't know, the suit looks confident.

14:05.190 --> 14:07.258
No way. Two-and-a-half-inch target.

14:17.669 --> 14:19.670
Oh!

14:21.907 --> 14:24.374
- Not bad, suit.
- Yeah, I'm back.

14:28.645 --> 14:30.446
Drew Poppleton.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.649
How many fights you been
in during your career, Drew?

14:33.683 --> 14:36.819
I don't know. 65? 250?

14:36.853 --> 14:39.655
That's kind of a big difference.
I guess I can work with that.

14:39.689 --> 14:42.491
You get any major injuries
protecting Lang in those fights?

14:42.526 --> 14:44.493
Uh, yeah.

14:44.528 --> 14:47.096
Broken jaw, broken hand, cracked ribs.

14:47.130 --> 14:49.098
Wow, you must have been pissed

14:49.132 --> 14:50.533
when he wanted to kick you off the team.

14:50.567 --> 14:53.269
Not gonna lie, it stung pretty bad.

14:53.303 --> 14:55.771
I'd totally understand
if you wanted retribution.

14:55.776 --> 14:57.306
- Totally.
- Totally?

14:57.541 --> 14:59.709
So you admit to wanting retribution?

14:59.743 --> 15:01.544
Yeah.

15:01.578 --> 15:03.012
Wait, what does retribution mean again?

15:03.046 --> 15:05.114
Is that, like, when
you... you get a refund

15:05.148 --> 15:07.617
from money, like, that you
paid out of your own pocket?

15:07.651 --> 15:08.718
Close.

15:08.752 --> 15:10.052
That's reimbursement.

15:10.087 --> 15:12.054
Retribution is revenge.

15:12.089 --> 15:14.690
Did you want revenge on Lang?

15:14.725 --> 15:17.093
Oh, no, I didn't want that.

15:17.127 --> 15:19.428
I mean, I... I didn't kill the
guy, if that's what you mean.

15:22.332 --> 15:23.499
Is that why I'm here?

15:23.533 --> 15:25.334
Yeah, you're a suspect,

15:25.369 --> 15:27.169
because Lang wanted to take away your job.

15:27.204 --> 15:30.573
There aren't many
enforcers left in hockey.

15:30.607 --> 15:31.974
Yeah, but I'm one of the best.

15:32.009 --> 15:33.576
Lots of teams want me.

15:33.610 --> 15:35.278
That's why I wasn't
sweating losing my job.

15:35.312 --> 15:37.847
Where were you last night,
between 10:30 and midnight?

15:37.881 --> 15:39.749
I was working out.

15:39.783 --> 15:40.750
That late?

15:40.784 --> 15:41.917
Where were you working out?

15:41.952 --> 15:43.152
Mainly my arms.

15:43.186 --> 15:45.588
It was a bis, tris and abs day.

15:45.622 --> 15:47.957
Okay.

15:47.991 --> 15:49.759
Let me rephrase that.

15:49.793 --> 15:53.796
So I found massive amounts of
fluid in the victim's lungs.

15:53.830 --> 15:55.798
So cause of death was drowning?

15:55.832 --> 15:58.567
He may have been alive when
he was dumped in the Anacostia.

15:58.602 --> 16:00.970
Perhaps. I'm still waiting
for further biopsy details.

16:01.004 --> 16:02.605
What do you have?

16:02.639 --> 16:04.607
Bilateral perimortem
fractures of the carpal bones

16:04.641 --> 16:06.475
suggest the victim threw several punches

16:06.510 --> 16:08.311
around the time he was killed.

16:08.345 --> 16:09.745
According to Booth, Lang wasn't the type

16:09.780 --> 16:11.747
of hockey player to get into fights.

16:11.782 --> 16:14.417
So maybe the fight wasn't
about hockey. It was personal.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.552
Well, that would certainly cause...

16:17.788 --> 16:18.954
... these... uh...

16:21.725 --> 16:22.725
Okay.

16:35.872 --> 16:37.306
Hey, check it out.

16:37.341 --> 16:38.974
I have to say,

16:39.009 --> 16:42.978
I am equal parts scared and fascinated.

16:43.013 --> 16:44.080
Coming your way.

16:51.121 --> 16:53.522
Hey, Oliver, looks like you got

16:53.557 --> 16:54.623
a little piece of lint there, buddy.

16:57.260 --> 16:59.495
I suppose that's very impressive.

16:59.529 --> 17:01.464
Watch this.

17:08.271 --> 17:11.741
Okay, that will certainly be
helpful in finding the head.

17:11.775 --> 17:12.875
What's that?

17:12.909 --> 17:14.242
Yeah, that's a second drone.

17:14.277 --> 17:16.811
- A second drone?
- Mm-hmm.

17:16.847 --> 17:19.248
You want help finding
the victim's missing head?

17:19.281 --> 17:22.050
I don't know. Think you
can find it before me?

17:22.085 --> 17:23.886
You want a rematch.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.388
Yeah, I do want a rematch.

17:26.423 --> 17:29.225
Okay, guys, this is not
a drone-measuring contest.

17:29.259 --> 17:32.061
Just find the missing
head as soon as possible.

17:32.095 --> 17:33.195
Go ahead.

17:33.230 --> 17:34.797
Ugh.

17:38.735 --> 17:40.569
Oh, game on.

17:41.772 --> 17:43.239
All right, so we're gonna go see

17:43.273 --> 17:44.740
the team's equipment manager, right?

17:44.775 --> 17:46.142
Yeah, Daryl Patterson.

17:46.176 --> 17:47.777
Lang lived in a gated community,

17:47.811 --> 17:49.779
and security said that he
visited three nights in a row

17:49.813 --> 17:50.980
before Lang was killed.

17:51.014 --> 17:52.815
Daryl Patterson.

17:52.849 --> 17:54.417
Why does that name sound familiar to me?

17:54.451 --> 17:55.418
Does he have a record?

17:55.452 --> 17:56.819
No, he's clean.

17:56.853 --> 17:58.187
Just a regular working-class guy,

17:58.221 --> 17:59.889
been with the team about 15 years.

17:59.923 --> 18:01.824
- Whoa.
- Whoa what?

18:01.858 --> 18:04.660
Good thing you got that
huge bag of socks back there.

18:04.694 --> 18:06.495
Never know when there
might be an emergency,

18:06.530 --> 18:07.897
you need 70 pairs right away.

18:07.931 --> 18:09.298
It's for Bones, okay?

18:09.332 --> 18:10.733
We're spring-cleaning,

18:10.767 --> 18:13.402
and, you know, we're
kind of at a standoff.

18:13.437 --> 18:14.904
I know, books versus socks.

18:14.938 --> 18:16.872
Right, okay, and I thought
that I'd take initiative

18:16.907 --> 18:18.407
and donate mine first.

18:18.442 --> 18:20.042
You're being the bigger man. That's great.

18:20.076 --> 18:21.644
I'm just saying, you should
probably throw them away.

18:21.678 --> 18:23.078
See, socks,

18:23.113 --> 18:25.214
they're like Social
Security numbers and diapers.

18:25.248 --> 18:26.949
Should only have one owner.

18:26.983 --> 18:27.950
Stop, okay?

18:27.984 --> 18:29.251
Just stop.

18:34.925 --> 18:36.292
Daryl Patterson?

18:36.326 --> 18:38.961
Special Agent James Aubrey, FBI.

18:38.995 --> 18:39.962
This is my partner.

18:39.996 --> 18:41.797
Seeley Booth.

18:41.832 --> 18:43.365
Sorry, do we know each other?

18:43.400 --> 18:45.134
It's me, Daryl.

18:45.168 --> 18:46.435
Daryl Patterson.

18:46.470 --> 18:48.037
Yeah, the equipment manager.

18:48.071 --> 18:49.939
Yeah, but n... no, uh...

18:49.973 --> 18:51.474
from the state championships
back in high school.

18:51.508 --> 18:53.342
I was the goalie for NA High.

18:53.376 --> 18:55.177
Yes, you were. Right, I told you.

18:55.212 --> 18:57.179
I... I knew I knew that name.

18:57.214 --> 18:59.148
Yeah, you were the goalie I...
I scored the penalty shot on

18:59.182 --> 19:00.916
- to win the championship.
- You know, I...

19:00.951 --> 19:03.319
That goal was controversial.

19:03.353 --> 19:06.455
I swiped the puck away
before it crossed the line.

19:06.490 --> 19:08.891
But, hey, who's keeping track, right?

19:08.925 --> 19:11.827
Um, apparently you are, 20 years later.

19:11.862 --> 19:13.596
You still play hockey?

19:13.630 --> 19:15.264
Yeah, here and there, but
that's not why we're here.

19:15.298 --> 19:17.366
We're here to talk about Seth Lang.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.001
Right.

19:19.035 --> 19:20.936
Yeah, it's really sad
what happened to him.

19:20.971 --> 19:22.538
Were you close with him?

19:22.572 --> 19:24.039
Yeah, you know, he wasn't one of those,

19:24.074 --> 19:25.474
uh, standoffish stars.

19:25.509 --> 19:27.309
He was... he was close with everyone.

19:27.344 --> 19:29.278
So you want to tell us
why you were at his house

19:29.312 --> 19:30.980
every night, before he was murdered?

19:31.014 --> 19:32.381
I'll tell you what, let's
head over to the rink.

19:32.415 --> 19:34.383
If Seeley gives me a penalty shot rematch,

19:34.417 --> 19:36.051
we can finally settle this debate.

19:36.086 --> 19:37.486
There's no debate.

19:37.521 --> 19:38.888
I took the shot, it went in,

19:38.922 --> 19:40.789
we won, you lost, life goes on.

19:40.824 --> 19:43.959
But if you give me a rematch,
I'll tell you why I was there.

19:43.994 --> 19:46.028
Or you could just tell
us why you were there,

19:46.062 --> 19:48.297
and we won't arrest you for
impeding an investigation.

19:48.331 --> 19:50.332
Geez, okay, uh...

19:50.367 --> 19:53.335
I was in... installing,
uh, an infinity rink.

19:53.370 --> 19:56.171
It's... it's like a
treadmill but for ice-skating.

19:56.206 --> 19:58.173
That's why you were at
his house after work.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.075
Those can be a hassle to set up.

20:00.110 --> 20:01.710
You know, I... I can hook you up with one,

20:01.745 --> 20:04.179
if you, uh, can score
a penalty shot on me.

20:04.214 --> 20:05.714
Just drop it, okay?

20:05.749 --> 20:07.716
We're not here to relive the glory days.

20:07.751 --> 20:10.553
We're here about a murder investigation.

20:25.035 --> 20:26.001
Is that it?

20:26.036 --> 20:27.202
Is that the head?

20:29.439 --> 20:30.706
Zooming in.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.747
Ah, not even close.

20:38.782 --> 20:41.584
Oh, not so hot when you don't cheat, huh?

20:41.618 --> 20:43.586
Keep talking smack,
Dr. Hodgins, seriously.

20:43.620 --> 20:45.588
Yeah? Your mom talks smack.

20:45.622 --> 20:47.256
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna plant

20:47.290 --> 20:49.658
a cypress tree in your mom's butt

20:49.693 --> 20:51.527
and then I'm gonna pull you
under the shade of that tree

20:51.561 --> 20:53.362
and I'm gonna slap you across the face.

20:53.396 --> 20:55.497
So you guys haven't found the head yet.

20:55.532 --> 20:58.133
Dr. Saroyan. Um, no, not... not yet.

20:58.168 --> 21:00.436
And, uh, sorry for all
that planting-trees-

21:00.470 --> 21:01.770
in-mom's-butt talk.

21:01.805 --> 21:04.773
That's just, uh,
testosterone-driven banter.

21:04.808 --> 21:07.676
Meanwhile, uh, I did get swab results,

21:07.711 --> 21:10.813
uh, from Lang's carpal bones
back, and I found traces

21:10.847 --> 21:13.248
of iron oxide as well as
synthetic blue pigments.

21:13.283 --> 21:16.251
It's basically blue paint and
rust that matches the lockers

21:16.286 --> 21:18.420
in the training room
at the hockey complex.

21:18.455 --> 21:21.757
Booth and Aubrey just questioned
the team's equipment manager.

21:21.791 --> 21:23.859
Well, he may or may not be clean,

21:23.893 --> 21:25.461
but Lang was likely
killed within the complex.

21:25.495 --> 21:28.297
Oh, this is Angela.

21:28.331 --> 21:31.133
Notify me when you find the
head, whoever finds it first.

21:31.167 --> 21:32.167
I will.

21:36.206 --> 21:37.573
Hey, what have you got?

21:37.607 --> 21:40.409
Uh, Lang's finances.

21:40.443 --> 21:43.846
He's clean, but there's
one recurring charge

21:43.880 --> 21:45.648
on his credit card
statement that stands out.

21:45.682 --> 21:47.216
"The Penalty Box."

21:47.250 --> 21:49.451
Yeah, it's a well-known hockey bar.

21:50.587 --> 21:52.388
Can you check social media

21:52.422 --> 21:53.822
to see if anyone tagged photos of Lang

21:53.857 --> 21:55.224
the last night he was there?

21:55.258 --> 21:56.659
Yeah, absolutely.

21:56.693 --> 21:58.627
Celebrity sightings are tagged a lot.

22:04.401 --> 22:05.501
- Uh, there.
- Oh.

22:05.535 --> 22:07.970
He's with Little Miss Tight Dress.

22:08.004 --> 22:10.072
And she is obviously mad.

22:10.106 --> 22:12.174
Can you run facial recognition on her?

22:12.208 --> 22:13.375
Uh, yeah.

22:13.410 --> 22:14.877
Already on it.

22:14.911 --> 22:16.211
Uh, okay.

22:16.246 --> 22:18.247
Alex Conrad, 30.

22:18.281 --> 22:20.182
Can you put her with Lang anywhere else?

22:23.219 --> 22:24.319
Uh, no,

22:24.354 --> 22:26.355
but I can put her with everyone else.

22:26.389 --> 22:28.791
Looks like we have a
hockey groupie on our hands.

22:35.996 --> 22:37.635
Alex Conrad,

22:38.097 --> 22:40.098
I'm Special Agent Aubrey, would you... Oh.

22:40.132 --> 22:41.099
You have a...

22:42.768 --> 22:43.735
Are you... ?

22:43.769 --> 22:45.536
I'm four months pregnant.

22:45.571 --> 22:46.537
Got it.

22:46.572 --> 22:47.639
Just been wrong before,

22:47.673 --> 22:49.607
never want to make that mistake again.

22:49.642 --> 22:50.808
Would you have a seat?

22:53.312 --> 22:55.480
So, tell me,

22:55.514 --> 22:57.081
what's it like being a hockey groupie?

22:57.116 --> 22:58.716
Excuse me?

22:58.751 --> 23:00.885
Social media, it's a
cop's new best friend.

23:00.919 --> 23:02.420
Online you were tagged having drinks

23:02.454 --> 23:04.889
with ten different
players at The Penalty Box.

23:04.923 --> 23:05.890
One of them...

23:05.924 --> 23:07.892
was Seth Lang.

23:07.926 --> 23:09.227
So?

23:09.261 --> 23:10.228
So what?

23:10.262 --> 23:11.462
So Lang is now dead.

23:11.497 --> 23:12.764
In that picture, whew!

23:12.798 --> 23:15.900
You look, I'd say, angry enough to kill.

23:15.934 --> 23:18.403
So you think I killed him?

23:18.437 --> 23:20.405
Why would I do that?

23:20.439 --> 23:21.706
Well, off the top of my head,

23:21.740 --> 23:22.774
I can think of two different scenarios.

23:22.808 --> 23:24.609
Scenario number one,

23:24.643 --> 23:27.712
you're pregnant with his kid and
extorting him for child support.

23:27.746 --> 23:29.447
Seth is not the father of my child.

23:29.481 --> 23:31.416
Which leads me to scenario

23:31.450 --> 23:34.118
numero dos, you're pregnant
with someone else's kid

23:34.153 --> 23:35.286
and Seth got jealous.

23:35.321 --> 23:38.823
So, tell me, who's the father?

23:38.857 --> 23:42.093
You think you've got this
all figured out, don't you?

23:42.127 --> 23:44.195
No, but I feel like I'm getting closer.

23:44.229 --> 23:46.030
In any case, the key seems to be

23:46.065 --> 23:48.132
in the details of your pregnancy.

23:48.167 --> 23:50.802
So what would you say if the
FBI started looking into that?

23:50.836 --> 23:52.970
I'd say that would be illegal

23:53.005 --> 23:55.573
since I didn't commit a felony
and you don't have a warrant.

23:57.142 --> 23:58.910
Well, then I guess getting a warrant

23:58.944 --> 24:01.079
is just what we'll have to do.

24:07.252 --> 24:08.920
Well, this is a good compromise.

24:08.954 --> 24:10.488
Booth gets those books out of the house,

24:10.522 --> 24:12.557
and you still get to hang on to them all.

24:12.591 --> 24:15.526
Unfortunately, these are
merely a fraction of my library.

24:15.561 --> 24:17.128
Okay.

24:17.162 --> 24:19.464
I can't imagine this
is related to the case.

24:19.498 --> 24:20.865
No, but just so you know,

24:20.899 --> 24:23.730
I found multiple curved
fractures of the ulnae.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.695
The plotting indicates
that they were caused by

24:26.772 --> 24:28.639
a thin, curved weapon.

24:28.674 --> 24:30.575
Hodgins swabbed for particulates,

24:30.609 --> 24:32.910
and we don't have anything to
do until he gets the results.

24:32.945 --> 24:35.746
So you're just stockpiling
books in the meantime?

24:35.781 --> 24:37.315
We're decluttering our home.

24:37.349 --> 24:40.418
Booth wanted me to get
rid of my books, but...

24:40.452 --> 24:42.147
I'm finding that to be quite difficult.

24:42.151 --> 24:44.619
Well, that's understandable.

24:44.654 --> 24:48.190
I mean, books have been
your escape your entire life.

24:48.224 --> 24:51.493
During the foster system
and then with your parents.

24:51.527 --> 24:54.229
But books are just inanimate objects.

24:54.263 --> 24:56.665
Oh, trust me, inanimate objects can carry

24:56.699 --> 24:58.500
a very deep emotional attachment.

24:58.534 --> 25:01.903
Oh, my God! Ah!

25:01.938 --> 25:04.606
Wow, it's the engagement ring.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.842
Arastoo did good.

25:06.876 --> 25:07.943
I agree.

25:07.977 --> 25:10.078
As far as well-marketed minerals

25:10.112 --> 25:12.948
masquerading as good investments go,

25:12.982 --> 25:14.516
this is exquisite.

25:14.550 --> 25:16.618
Thanks, I think.

25:16.652 --> 25:18.453
It's beautiful, Cam.

25:18.488 --> 25:20.121
Thank you.

25:20.156 --> 25:21.590
And... and anyway, I... I didn't
mean to hijack the conversation.

25:21.624 --> 25:23.158
The point is,

25:23.192 --> 25:25.227
I totally understand how
you feel about your books.

25:25.261 --> 25:27.462
I mean, if you get rid of them

25:27.497 --> 25:30.098
or if you keep them, you
still have those memories

25:30.132 --> 25:31.399
to hold on to.

25:31.434 --> 25:33.335
All right, Hodgins just got

25:33.369 --> 25:35.070
his swab results back...
it's stainless steel.

25:35.104 --> 25:37.506
The cold tub at the training facility.

25:37.540 --> 25:39.841
It's stainless steel, and
the fractures of the ulnae

25:39.876 --> 25:43.778
were very likely the result
of the victim flailing

25:43.813 --> 25:44.779
while being drowned.

25:44.814 --> 25:45.881
Okay, I'll tell Booth.

25:47.950 --> 25:51.686
Man, gone over every inch of the banks.

25:51.721 --> 25:53.688
Maybe you miscalculated
the discovery area.

25:53.723 --> 25:55.357
I did not make a miscalculation.

25:55.391 --> 25:56.758
You know what maybe did
make a miscalculation?

25:56.792 --> 25:57.959
Please do not say my face.

25:57.994 --> 25:59.261
Your butt.

25:59.295 --> 26:00.862
You're like a child.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.166
Wait a second, that's actually it.

26:05.201 --> 26:06.401
What's "it," your butt?

26:06.435 --> 26:07.502
The abutment.

26:07.537 --> 26:09.137
We got to get over to the bridge

26:09.171 --> 26:10.739
in the discovery area,
and check the abutments.

26:10.773 --> 26:13.508
That's a prime location for
the head to have gotten stuck.

26:13.543 --> 26:15.143
Race to the bridge?

26:15.177 --> 26:16.845
Oh, game on.

26:28.658 --> 26:29.724
Wait.

26:29.759 --> 26:31.793
That's it.

26:31.827 --> 26:33.728
Next to the abutment. Or
at least what's left of it.

26:33.763 --> 26:35.530
I win!

26:37.233 --> 26:38.633
No, no, no, no, no, what are you doing?

26:38.668 --> 26:39.868
That's my head. I got there first.

26:39.902 --> 26:42.037
Yeah, well, I discovered the abutment.

26:42.071 --> 26:44.372
Yeah, well, I made the butt
joke that led to your discovery.

26:47.710 --> 26:49.344
Come on, come on, come on.

26:52.181 --> 26:53.515
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

27:00.022 --> 27:01.022
Oh!

27:01.057 --> 27:05.493
And I am off for my triumphant
flight back to the lab.

27:08.531 --> 27:10.298
- Drowned in the cold tub, huh?
- Yeah, and the person

27:10.333 --> 27:12.901
who locks up the training
room is your old hockey rival,

27:12.935 --> 27:14.369
- Daryl Patterson.
- Oh, stop, will you?

27:14.403 --> 27:15.570
Come on, he's not my rival.

27:15.605 --> 27:16.871
That was a long time ago.

27:16.906 --> 27:19.040
Look, Booth, uh, ever since you scored

27:19.075 --> 27:20.342
that winning goal against him,

27:20.376 --> 27:23.044
you've gone on to a
series of heroic moments,

27:23.079 --> 27:25.347
while he became an equipment manager.

27:25.381 --> 27:27.415
That's his choice if he wants
to dwell on the past, not mine.

27:27.450 --> 27:29.751
Well, speaking of the past, I
looked into his eBay history:

27:29.785 --> 27:31.853
Turns out he's been selling some
of Lang's personal stuff online,

27:31.887 --> 27:32.887
making some good money.

27:32.922 --> 27:33.888
What kind of stuff?

27:33.923 --> 27:35.690
Oh, everything from pucks, jerseys,

27:35.725 --> 27:37.225
mouthpieces, jockstraps.

27:37.259 --> 27:39.728
Jockstraps?

27:39.762 --> 27:41.363
It's getting to you, isn't it, Seeley?

27:41.397 --> 27:43.231
What are you talking about?

27:43.265 --> 27:44.633
You replaying our epic penalty shot

27:44.667 --> 27:46.067
over and over in your head

27:46.102 --> 27:47.235
and finally realizing that maybe

27:47.269 --> 27:49.104
it wasn't a goal after all.

27:49.138 --> 27:51.272
Well, I hadn't given a second
thought to you or that goal.

27:51.307 --> 27:52.807
Well, then, what do you have to lose

27:52.842 --> 27:54.609
in giving me a rematch?

27:54.644 --> 27:55.810
Scared, Seeley?

27:55.845 --> 27:57.145
I don't think Agent Booth

27:57.179 --> 27:58.913
has as much to lose here
as you do, Patterson.

27:58.948 --> 28:00.649
What do you mean?

28:00.683 --> 28:02.684
I mean, you are now a
suspect in Lang's murder.

28:02.718 --> 28:04.219
What?

28:04.253 --> 28:07.088
I already told you why I was at his house.

28:07.123 --> 28:08.757
Yeah, but you conveniently
left out the fact

28:08.791 --> 28:10.225
that you've been stealing
Lang's personal items

28:10.259 --> 28:11.459
and selling them online.

28:11.494 --> 28:12.627
A jockstrap?

28:12.662 --> 28:13.928
Come on.

28:13.963 --> 28:15.697
Hey, I got 120 bucks for that.

28:15.731 --> 28:17.399
And all you had to do was
rummage through his locker

28:17.433 --> 28:18.400
and steal it.

28:18.434 --> 28:19.801
No, I didn't steal anything.

28:19.835 --> 28:21.736
He gave me everything I sold,

28:21.771 --> 28:23.071
including the jockstrap.

28:23.105 --> 28:24.105
Why would he do that?

28:26.008 --> 28:27.876
Because Lang was a... a good dude

28:27.910 --> 28:29.778
and he was throwing me a bone, all right?

28:29.812 --> 28:31.646
He knew I wasn't getting paid a lot,

28:31.681 --> 28:33.948
so, with the recent cutbacks...

28:33.983 --> 28:35.316
What recent cutbacks?

28:35.351 --> 28:38.820
Ever since Jerry Stober's trophy wife

28:38.854 --> 28:41.089
took the team over, she
made a bunch of moves,

28:41.123 --> 28:44.592
starting with cutting
staff salaries by 15%.

28:44.627 --> 28:45.927
Wait, Katie Stober did that?

28:45.961 --> 28:48.697
It seems kind of drastic
for a clueless new owner.

28:48.731 --> 28:50.165
Katie Stober isn't clueless.

28:50.199 --> 28:51.533
No, you're saying that she's just

28:51.567 --> 28:52.867
a shrewd businesswoman.

28:52.902 --> 28:55.203
No, I'm saying she's a
cold, calculating bitch.

29:06.849 --> 29:08.316
Dr. Hodgins...

29:08.350 --> 29:10.385
Uh-uh, don't try to steal my moment here.

29:10.419 --> 29:12.387
No, no, seriously, uh, Dr. Hodgins.

29:12.421 --> 29:14.489
What?

29:14.523 --> 29:17.392
It's somebody's head!

29:17.426 --> 29:19.327
Ooh.

29:19.361 --> 29:21.029
- Come on, honey, let's go.
- Look at that.

29:21.063 --> 29:23.865
Maybe I should've taken
a different route home.

29:27.083 --> 29:29.483
Any progress weeding
through the team documents?

29:29.484 --> 29:31.752
Yeah, it turns out that
Booth's lead was right.

29:31.786 --> 29:34.788
Katie Stober made some pretty
shrewd business decisions

29:34.822 --> 29:36.623
when she took over that team.

29:36.658 --> 29:39.826
Looks like she immediately
reduced the team's overhead.

29:39.861 --> 29:44.031
Yeah, she cut back on everything
from equipment to catering.

29:44.065 --> 29:45.165
It's like she was intentionally trying

29:45.200 --> 29:46.700
to milk the team dry.

29:46.734 --> 29:48.368
Booth, good timing.

29:48.403 --> 29:50.304
If anyone can make
sense of this, it's you.

29:50.338 --> 29:51.805
Really, Cam? A flying head?

29:51.839 --> 29:53.640
Okay, that may be the most
confusing phone greeting

29:53.675 --> 29:54.708
I've ever gotten.

29:54.742 --> 29:55.742
Okay, look,

29:55.777 --> 29:57.144
I just got reports, all right?

29:57.178 --> 29:59.846
Of a drone carrying a decapitated head

29:59.881 --> 30:00.881
around the DC area.

30:00.915 --> 30:01.982
Oh.

30:02.016 --> 30:04.418
I, uh, guess we found the head.

30:04.452 --> 30:05.852
I thought the drones

30:05.887 --> 30:07.754
were supposed to locate
and search for the head;

30:07.988 --> 30:09.263
I didn't really... think
through the logistics.

30:09.303 --> 30:12.272
Well, Aubrey's on his way
over to slap some wrists.

30:12.306 --> 30:14.541
Okay, we'll be ready for an earful.

30:14.575 --> 30:17.244
Hey, Booth, while we have you, um,

30:17.278 --> 30:19.413
I just sent over some team documents.

30:19.667 --> 30:21.435
Oh, all right.

30:21.469 --> 30:23.570
These confused us a little.

30:23.604 --> 30:25.172
Wait a second.

30:25.206 --> 30:26.573
These trade proposals don't make sense.

30:26.607 --> 30:27.674
- How so?
- Well, it looks

30:27.709 --> 30:29.242
like she's trying to tank the team.

30:29.277 --> 30:31.044
Why would anyone do that?

30:31.079 --> 30:32.245
Well, you know, player performance

30:32.280 --> 30:33.880
and ticket sales are low enough, you know,

30:33.915 --> 30:35.582
she could legally move the team.

30:35.616 --> 30:37.050
Move the team? To where?

30:37.085 --> 30:38.251
To a bigger market.

30:38.286 --> 30:40.020
So, making the team bad

30:40.054 --> 30:41.588
would be lucrative for her.

30:41.622 --> 30:42.656
How lucrative?

30:42.690 --> 30:45.025
At least $200 million, give or take 50.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.268
Ooh.

30:55.303 --> 30:57.037
Come to papa.

31:02.243 --> 31:04.344
What are you doing?

31:07.615 --> 31:09.249
This, my friend,

31:09.283 --> 31:10.250
is what we call

31:10.284 --> 31:11.885
a victory lap.

31:44.352 --> 31:45.952
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

31:45.987 --> 31:47.320
is how it's done.

31:47.355 --> 31:49.222
Huh? How cool was that?

31:49.257 --> 31:50.891
Gentlemen.

31:50.925 --> 31:52.259
Wipe that smile off your face.

31:52.293 --> 31:54.928
- Agent Aubrey is here to scold us.
- That's right.

31:54.962 --> 31:57.697
So, if anyone asks, I gave you
both a pretty intense spanking.

31:57.732 --> 32:00.400
I will not be admitting
to a spanking of any kind.

32:00.435 --> 32:02.536
Okay, we got it, Aubrey, you
gave us a stern talking to.

32:02.570 --> 32:04.104
Thank you.

32:04.138 --> 32:05.238
Whoa.

32:05.273 --> 32:07.307
No way.

32:07.341 --> 32:10.143
High-speed surveillance
cameras, retractable claw.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.645
I mean, it's like a real-life version

32:11.679 --> 32:13.613
of the game Aerial Attack.

32:13.648 --> 32:15.148
Yeah, that was the
inspiration for the design.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.150
Wait... wait a second, you play?

32:17.185 --> 32:18.418
Uh, yeah.

32:18.453 --> 32:20.053
Pretty good, too.

32:20.087 --> 32:22.088
Oh, I'm sure you think you're pretty good.

32:22.123 --> 32:24.324
I  think I'm pretty good?

32:24.358 --> 32:25.926
Aubrey, look at us. We're lab nerds, okay?

32:25.960 --> 32:27.461
I'm sure, when you play
with your jock friends,

32:27.495 --> 32:29.296
you're good, but when it
comes to Aerial Attack,

32:29.330 --> 32:30.831
you can't hang with us.

32:30.865 --> 32:32.132
You guys, I'm a gamer, okay?

32:32.166 --> 32:33.733
I was just being humble
by saying I'm pretty good,

32:33.768 --> 32:34.734
I'm actually very good.

32:34.769 --> 32:36.670
Really? What level are you?

32:36.704 --> 32:39.139
Level 50 pilot, all red gear. You?

32:39.173 --> 32:42.809
You know, we... we just
started playing, so...

32:42.844 --> 32:44.644
- Oh, just started?
- Yeah.

32:44.679 --> 32:46.046
I could be a level 50 pilot

32:46.080 --> 32:48.181
if I wanted to, but, for
me, it's really a time thing.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.382
Hmm, the time, right.

32:49.417 --> 32:51.017
Well, maybe when the
case is over, we can...

32:51.052 --> 32:52.152
Yeah, you just make sure

32:52.186 --> 32:55.021
you never, ever do anything as stupid

32:55.056 --> 32:57.724
as fly a decapitated head over civilians.

32:57.758 --> 32:59.326
Hey, well, I just wanted to make sure

32:59.360 --> 33:01.328
you get X-rays to Dr.
Brennan as soon as possible,

33:01.362 --> 33:02.729
and I will be back to examine in ten.

33:02.763 --> 33:04.264
You got it.

33:04.298 --> 33:06.099
Sorry for the holdup,
Cam. Just wanted to issue

33:06.133 --> 33:08.101
a warning to these two
on behalf of the FBI.

33:08.135 --> 33:11.505
Don't want to have to restrict
them from public airspace.

33:11.539 --> 33:14.040
Thank you. I'm sure
that they appreciate it.

33:14.075 --> 33:17.911
Especially if they ever want to
be a level 50 with all red gear.

33:28.489 --> 33:30.290
Sorry, still a mess.

33:30.324 --> 33:32.292
I'm such a scatterbrain.

33:32.326 --> 33:34.060
You can drop the act.

33:34.095 --> 33:36.496
What are you talking about?

33:36.531 --> 33:38.498
We're talking about
you sabotaging the team

33:38.533 --> 33:41.501
with financial cutbacks and bad trades.

33:41.536 --> 33:43.370
You wanted to have a horrible team.

33:43.404 --> 33:46.206
Why would I want that?

33:46.240 --> 33:48.475
So you can move the team to a
bigger market, make more money.

33:51.479 --> 33:53.880
Moving the team isn't a crime.

33:53.915 --> 33:57.050
Then why the charade as
the victimized trophy wife?

33:58.920 --> 34:01.721
Because if the fans and the
media caught wind of the move,

34:01.756 --> 34:03.823
I'd be hanged in my own hometown.

34:03.858 --> 34:05.959
I'd say the bigger problem is,
it gives you motive for murder.

34:05.993 --> 34:08.460
- You think I killed Lang?
- You can only move the team

34:08.496 --> 34:10.697
if you come in last place
and have poor attendance.

34:10.731 --> 34:13.132
Getting rid of your star
is the best way to do that.

34:13.167 --> 34:16.402
I'll admit I'm not as clueless
as I'd have the public believe,

34:16.437 --> 34:17.670
but I would never kill anyone.

34:17.705 --> 34:19.005
I don't know.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.007
Couple hundred million
dollars is pretty enticing

34:21.042 --> 34:23.043
to a shrewd businesswoman.

34:23.077 --> 34:26.045
Look, Lang and I had a good relationship.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.947
He really cared about the game,

34:27.982 --> 34:29.783
and I was even helping
him clean up the sport.

34:29.817 --> 34:31.284
How so?

34:31.319 --> 34:32.719
He found out that a
woman named Alex Conrad

34:32.753 --> 34:34.219
was causing trouble for the team.

34:34.255 --> 34:36.456
Wait, you care which hockey groupies

34:36.489 --> 34:37.891
are sleeping with your players?

34:37.925 --> 34:39.592
Alex Conrad isn't a groupie.

34:39.627 --> 34:40.594
She's a pusher.

34:40.628 --> 34:41.695
A drug dealer.

34:41.728 --> 34:43.563
The corporate kind.

34:43.598 --> 34:46.565
She supplies painkillers, speed, HGH.

34:46.601 --> 34:48.568
She had met with a bunch
of Lang's teammates.

34:48.603 --> 34:51.237
Lang found out and he
was not happy about it.

34:51.272 --> 34:53.940
He said he was gonna
to confront her, but...

34:53.975 --> 34:56.810
after he did, I never
heard from him again.

35:00.314 --> 35:01.781
The fractured mandible

35:01.816 --> 35:05.218
and the missing
mandibular central incisors

35:05.252 --> 35:07.120
are documented hockey injuries.

35:07.154 --> 35:10.123
The sharp force trauma on
the inferior margin of the C6

35:10.157 --> 35:13.560
was clearly caused by
the powerboat propeller.

35:13.594 --> 35:15.562
The contusions on the
occipital and parietal bones

35:15.596 --> 35:18.264
are from banging against the
abutment in the Anacostia.

35:18.299 --> 35:22.268
There's also the comminuted
fracture on the occipital.

35:22.303 --> 35:24.270
It appears to have been
obscured by the bruising

35:24.305 --> 35:25.672
caused by the abutment.

35:25.706 --> 35:27.674
The severity and placement of the blow

35:27.708 --> 35:30.310
would have been powerful enough
to knock Lang unconscious.

35:30.344 --> 35:33.079
Precisely, but before he
was drowned in the cold tub.

35:33.114 --> 35:36.082
If you're not engaged
in a childish video game

35:36.117 --> 35:38.251
- with Dr. Hodgins...
- Currently I am not.

35:38.285 --> 35:40.687
... then I will have
him swab the fracture.

35:49.363 --> 35:51.264
Sorry.

35:51.298 --> 35:52.999
Am I, uh, interrupting a date?

35:53.034 --> 35:54.467
Maybe a drug deal?

35:55.836 --> 35:57.437
Excuse me for a minute.

35:57.471 --> 35:59.906
Yeah, just a minute.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.908
Or maybe five to ten years.

36:01.942 --> 36:05.512
So... you aren't a
groupie at all, are you?

36:05.546 --> 36:06.646
I never said I was.

36:06.681 --> 36:08.181
You did.

36:08.215 --> 36:09.582
Well, now I'm saying
that Lang was a purist

36:09.617 --> 36:11.317
who wanted to clean up the game.

36:11.352 --> 36:13.753
He was the face of his team,
head of the players' union.

36:13.788 --> 36:16.589
- So?
- So he found out that you were a pusher

36:16.624 --> 36:18.425
and was gonna out your whole drug scandal.

36:18.459 --> 36:20.427
That would have put you
in jail for a long time,

36:20.461 --> 36:22.095
which is why you killed him.

36:22.129 --> 36:24.964
There's no way you can prove any of that.

36:24.999 --> 36:26.700
You know, a lot of guilty people say that.

36:26.734 --> 36:29.869
No, I am saying that
because I didn't do it.

36:31.906 --> 36:34.908
Look, Seth did confront me here,

36:34.942 --> 36:36.910
and, yes, he did threaten to out me,

36:36.944 --> 36:40.313
but after that, he left,
and I never saw him again.

36:40.347 --> 36:44.317
You are dealing with drugs,
murder and jail time here.

36:44.351 --> 36:46.953
You really want to bring
a child into that world?

36:49.423 --> 36:51.858
I didn't think I...

36:54.595 --> 36:55.995
You didn't think what?

36:56.030 --> 36:58.998
Nothing.

36:59.033 --> 37:01.634
I, I want a lawyer.

37:07.073 --> 37:10.753
Now that the skull is clean,
I see a faint extension

37:10.755 --> 37:12.889
of the comminuted
fracture on the occipital.

37:13.204 --> 37:15.972
The plotting of the sections indicates

37:16.007 --> 37:18.408
that this was also
performed by a curved weapon.

37:18.442 --> 37:21.478
Will you bring up the X-rays
of the victim's ulnar fractures?

37:21.512 --> 37:24.314
I see where you're going with this.

37:24.348 --> 37:27.851
If we overlay the X-rays, we can see...

37:27.885 --> 37:30.920
if the fractures match.

37:30.955 --> 37:32.922
They're not a match.

37:32.957 --> 37:35.925
So we're looking for a different
curved weapon than the cold tub.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.360
Hey, I have the results.

37:37.465 --> 37:39.466
So I found a carbon composite

37:39.500 --> 37:42.435
with 70% graphite and 30% fiberglass.

37:42.470 --> 37:44.270
A curved weapon of that composite

37:44.305 --> 37:46.306
is most likely a hockey stick.

37:46.340 --> 37:48.174
Yeah, obviously.

37:48.209 --> 37:49.943
But that's no help.

37:49.977 --> 37:51.778
There's probably hundreds of hockey sticks

37:51.812 --> 37:53.780
owned by hundreds of different
players within that complex.

37:53.814 --> 37:55.548
We need to get this information to Booth.

37:55.583 --> 37:57.984
Why? These are simply
composition statistics.

37:58.018 --> 37:59.819
No, this is his world.

37:59.854 --> 38:02.288
If anyone can decipher the data
we've accumulated, it's him.

38:08.129 --> 38:09.462
So it looks like the warrant that we got

38:09.497 --> 38:10.630
for Alex Conrad paid off.

38:10.664 --> 38:12.298
Yeah, you got her medical records?

38:12.333 --> 38:14.601
No, not yet, but her credit
card shows multiple payments

38:14.635 --> 38:16.603
for parking meters near her ob-gyn,

38:16.637 --> 38:18.004
which is strange because
there's no evidence

38:18.038 --> 38:19.839
that she paid any of her medical bills.

38:19.874 --> 38:21.841
Looks like her baby daddy was
footing the bill, that's why.

38:23.711 --> 38:25.145
What do you got?

38:26.480 --> 38:28.882
All right, this is good.
Looks like Seth Lang

38:28.916 --> 38:31.151
was whacked over the
head with a hockey stick.

38:31.185 --> 38:33.987
No. A hockey player got
attacked with a hockey stick?

38:34.021 --> 38:35.522
- That's useful.
- Yeah, it is.

38:35.556 --> 38:37.357
I mean, every professional hockey player

38:37.391 --> 38:39.793
has their own personalized custom stick,

38:39.827 --> 38:42.629
from composition to flex to blade pattern.

38:42.663 --> 38:44.964
So each stick is like a fingerprint.

38:44.999 --> 38:47.367
Exactly. Okay, we find that
stick that matches the player,

38:47.401 --> 38:48.768
we got the murderer.

38:48.803 --> 38:50.436
I'm gonna call Bones.

39:02.416 --> 39:05.285
- Ironic, isn't it?
- What is?

39:05.319 --> 39:08.221
Your job was to protect Lang,
and you ended up killing him.

39:08.255 --> 39:10.290
What? That's ridiculous.

39:10.324 --> 39:13.293
After all the injuries
you sustained from hockey,

39:13.327 --> 39:15.461
you were in considerable pain,

39:15.496 --> 39:16.863
so you started taking OxyContin.

39:16.897 --> 39:18.932
I took some painkillers. Big deal.

39:18.966 --> 39:21.434
It's a big deal 'cause that's
how you met Alex Conrad, huh?

39:21.468 --> 39:23.570
You found love,

39:23.604 --> 39:26.339
which is why you're paying
for her prenatal care.

39:26.373 --> 39:29.342
Her baby is yours.

39:29.376 --> 39:32.178
Well, that still doesn't prove anything.

39:32.213 --> 39:34.214
Well, Lang found out that she
was pushing drugs on the players.

39:34.248 --> 39:35.849
He wanted to put her in jail,

39:35.883 --> 39:39.819
but then he got knocked
unconscious with a hockey stick.

39:39.904 --> 39:44.474
A carbon composite stick
with a slightly opened pattern

39:44.508 --> 39:46.075
and a 110 flex.

39:46.110 --> 39:48.077
Do those specifications sound familiar?

39:48.112 --> 39:49.913
Because after you knocked him unconscious,

39:49.947 --> 39:52.549
you drowned him in the cold tub.

39:52.583 --> 39:55.018
It was either that

39:55.052 --> 39:57.453
or see the love of your life go down.

40:02.493 --> 40:05.461
I protected him on the ice for years.

40:05.496 --> 40:09.132
All I asked for was for him
to protect me just this once.

40:12.903 --> 40:14.871
Look, I didn't want my kid to grow up

40:14.905 --> 40:16.906
with a mother behind bars.

40:35.159 --> 40:37.961
Booth, are you sure you're
ready for a hockey rematch?

40:37.995 --> 40:39.362
You haven't played in a while.

40:39.396 --> 40:40.797
It's not a rematch. This guy just wants

40:40.831 --> 40:42.265
to redo the penalty shot, okay?

40:42.299 --> 40:44.334
Besides, I know his
weakness, it's four-hole.

40:44.368 --> 40:45.535
Four-hole?

40:45.569 --> 40:47.370
Yeah, it's the lower stick side.

40:47.404 --> 40:50.039
Wait a second, you're gonna...
you're gonna read your books

40:50.074 --> 40:51.674
- at my shoot-out?
- Oh, no.

40:51.709 --> 40:53.509
I finally made the decision to let go.

40:53.544 --> 40:55.545
I'm getting rid of all the
books that I can live without.

40:55.579 --> 40:57.080
Wow, that's amazing. You're getting rid

40:57.114 --> 40:58.548
of all of them except those three?

40:58.582 --> 41:00.583
No, Booth. No.

41:00.618 --> 41:02.585
These are the three I'm
willing to part with.

41:02.620 --> 41:03.987
- The rest I'm keeping.
- Whoa.

41:04.021 --> 41:05.088
Wait a second, are you serious?

41:05.122 --> 41:06.689
Yes. You ready to go?

41:06.724 --> 41:08.658
- Let's go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:12.496 --> 41:14.564
Go!

41:17.501 --> 41:19.035
Go, Booth!

41:25.075 --> 41:27.076
Let's do this, Booth!

41:39.290 --> 41:40.590
It's all you!

41:40.624 --> 41:42.625
Come on, Daryl! You got this!

41:51.535 --> 41:53.236
Concentrate!

42:11.622 --> 42:12.588
Nice save.

42:12.623 --> 42:14.023
That was a good move, Booth.

42:14.058 --> 42:15.758
Good try.

42:15.793 --> 42:17.026
You got me this time.

42:20.631 --> 42:21.698
Yeah!

42:24.601 --> 42:26.002
You lost on purpose.

42:26.036 --> 42:27.670
That wasn't the four-hole.

42:27.705 --> 42:30.073
No, I guess it wasn't.

42:30.107 --> 42:32.675
I guess now this guy
can move on with his life

42:32.710 --> 42:33.943
and forget about the past.

42:33.978 --> 42:36.379
Just like me and my books?

42:36.413 --> 42:38.014
Three measly books.

42:38.048 --> 42:39.349
You're getting rid of three measly books.

42:39.383 --> 42:40.817
It's a big step for me, Booth.

42:40.851 --> 42:42.552
You're letting go of three
books... that's not a big step.

42:42.586 --> 42:43.820
Okay, I guess, you know, tomorrow,

42:43.854 --> 42:46.155
- I'll go buy some new socks.
- N... no.

42:46.190 --> 42:48.124
- No, don't you dare.
- What do you mean?

42:48.158 --> 42:49.792
- I'm not going out and buying...
- Great idea.

42:49.827 --> 42:51.828
You're getting skates right now.
