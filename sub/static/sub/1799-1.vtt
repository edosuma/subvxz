01:41.185 --> 01:42.544
Lucky ring on

01:43.350 --> 01:44.860
I feel so much safer

01:44.895 --> 01:46.688
We're coming in hot

02:30.359 --> 02:31.058
Hold on

03:43.480 --> 03:44.396
Let's go

03:58.561 --> 03:59.503
What's the hold up?

04:00.038 --> 04:01.595
Nothing, we're on our way.

04:02.430 --> 04:03.553
Let's go!

04:21.392 --> 04:23.104
Your dude's trippin'

04:53.002 --> 04:55.637
Stay on the wall, beware

05:25.174 --> 05:27.721
- Hey forget this maniac
- I'm not leaving him

05:31.842 --> 05:32.623
Come

06:17.718 --> 06:20.981
You're just gonna rolled up on me huh?
After 8 damn years

06:22.071 --> 06:23.276
What's up with that?

06:23.311 --> 06:26.901
You're in a black ops prison that
doesn't officially exist

06:26.936 --> 06:29.678
I just got the location from a guy named Church

06:30.458 --> 06:31.797
An agency spook

06:31.832 --> 06:32.703
Excuse me?

06:33.582 --> 06:35.791
Agency's official relax

06:35.826 --> 06:37.521
Thank you for this, man.

06:38.334 --> 06:39.742
What a waste of life

06:39.777 --> 06:41.972
You make 1 damn mistake

06:42.007 --> 06:43.465
It wasn't a mistake

06:43.500 --> 06:46.705
It was stupid. You'd done that to me I would've
chopped you into pieces

06:46.740 --> 06:48.184
You would've tried

06:49.142 --> 06:50.121
Hey you want to thank the guys?

06:50.156 --> 06:53.106
The guys?
Where our guys?

06:53.141 --> 06:55.705
Hammer, Guzman..
- Gone

06:55.740 --> 06:57.996
They'd gone?

06:58.031 --> 06:59.583
Yeah

07:19.789 --> 07:21.396
Heard you killed more people than the plague

07:21.431 --> 07:22.906
What about that?

07:22.941 --> 07:24.832
The way they called you "Doctor Death"?

07:24.867 --> 07:26.800
I've been in the medical field

07:28.706 --> 07:30.104
But that was a long time ago

07:30.139 --> 07:32.455
So why'd you get locked away?

07:34.457 --> 07:36.104
Tax evasion

07:39.532 --> 07:41.844
So you're all that's left of The Expendables

07:41.879 --> 07:43.635
We're it

07:43.670 --> 07:45.429
We started out with 5

07:45.464 --> 07:46.864
Built up to 22

07:50.769 --> 07:52.869
I see Barney still hanging the tags up there

07:54.952 --> 07:57.584
See that jingling sounds the tags make

07:57.619 --> 08:01.543
That's a reminder that our brothers are still here

08:03.266 --> 08:05.280
Somewhere

08:06.604 --> 08:07.566
Come on viking

08:08.990 --> 08:11.555
Quit screwing with your blade

08:12.572 --> 08:15.255
Or else you might find your tags up there

08:15.290 --> 08:17.427
Jingling too

08:18.764 --> 08:21.811
Jingling...jingling jingling

08:27.404 --> 08:28.907
Sharpen it when you're done

08:45.194 --> 08:46.942
I think your friend is a little off

08:46.977 --> 08:49.750
Come on Christmas, he's been in
a hole for over a year

08:49.785 --> 08:50.945
How'd he get so lucky

08:50.980 --> 08:56.845
He tried pulling it off his half-assed political assassination
for a few bucks in this place called Swaziland

08:56.880 --> 08:58.052
And he blew it

08:59.206 --> 09:00.479
Self destructive

09:00.514 --> 09:02.563
Yes something like that.
But in all those years he's a good medic.

09:03.398 --> 09:04.596
I would need to do a little checkup

09:04.731 --> 09:06.538
- Why are you so sarcastic?
- You're fake

09:07.073 --> 09:08.549
- Fake?
- Secrets, idiot.

09:09.284 --> 09:12.132
I mean why do you take me off running around the
planet

09:12.137 --> 09:15.188
To save this medical genius

09:15.223 --> 09:16.413
As you describes

09:16.448 --> 09:17.645
For what?

09:17.680 --> 09:20.112
He's an Expendables

09:20.147 --> 09:20.747
Come on

09:20.782 --> 09:22.082
He's an Expandables

09:22.117 --> 09:23.029
So he's 1 of the flock

09:23.064 --> 09:24.190
Well let me tell you something

09:24.225 --> 09:26.371
When you're incarcerated for years

09:27.046 --> 09:28.701
I will come and save you

09:28.736 --> 09:30.181
Thank you

09:31.414 --> 09:32.402
But I doubt it

09:32.437 --> 09:34.088
And I know you'd do the same for me

09:34.123 --> 09:35.590
Truthfully?

09:35.625 --> 09:37.124
You'd let me ride?

09:37.159 --> 09:38.193
Exactly

09:42.155 --> 09:43.736
Hey Doc

09:46.401 --> 09:47.386
What's your name?

09:47.421 --> 09:49.042
Christmas

09:49.077 --> 09:50.835
Is that real?

09:50.870 --> 09:52.195
Authentic

09:52.230 --> 09:53.855
Is that real too?

09:53.890 --> 09:58.986
Oh no, I uh...spend 3 hours every morning
putting this up

09:59.995 --> 10:00.524
This is real

10:01.953 --> 10:02.536
Authentic

10:03.371 --> 10:04.533
Original

10:04.568 --> 10:05.591
Look at that

10:10.868 --> 10:12.168
Ballast is a little off

10:13.890 --> 10:16.136
You uh, a knife man?

10:16.171 --> 10:18.598
Best, ever

10:19.363 --> 10:20.984
I'm the knife before Christmas

10:21.019 --> 10:22.770
Ain't that right Barney

10:22.805 --> 10:24.176
If you say so

10:24.211 --> 10:27.164
Probably freestyling with a blade while you're
still sucking on your dad titties

10:27.199 --> 10:29.133
Trying to learn how to eat with a spoon

10:29.168 --> 10:30.636
Yeah

10:30.671 --> 10:33.484
You want to let us on a little secret you're
keeping

10:33.519 --> 10:35.417
Stay out of my brain

10:35.452 --> 10:37.008
I'm gonna tell you
I can't wait to get home

10:37.043 --> 10:38.765
Eat some good food

10:38.800 --> 10:41.057
Put on some fine threads

10:41.092 --> 10:43.099
Break up my 49' Pontiac

10:43.134 --> 10:45.915
Keep that baby until the engine blows up

10:47.469 --> 10:49.018
You didn't tell him did you?

10:49.053 --> 10:50.489
Tell me what?

10:50.524 --> 10:52.642
We're not going home

10:57.019 --> 10:57.019
We're stopping at a dealer
The delivery of a shipment of bombs Altherometekih

10:57.054 --> 10:58.917
Ow, come on man

10:58.952 --> 11:00.539
That shit is hellfire

11:00.574 --> 11:00.578
Hey we're changing stuff

11:01.413 --> 11:03.569
You know why don't you just pick me up on your way back

11:03.804 --> 11:04.545
We're a man short

11:05.280 --> 11:06.557
Well, you know, I'd love to party with you boys

11:07.492 --> 11:10.501
But, uh, I don't have my shit

11:18.651 --> 11:19.563
That's my shit

11:19.598 --> 11:20.477
That is your shit

11:24.521 --> 11:27.621
Doc, have you thank the guys,
helping you out?

11:30.815 --> 11:31.587
Say something

11:38.518 --> 11:39.683
Uh listen up

11:41.767 --> 11:45.034
It's been a long time since I had a reason to say thank you

11:45.069 --> 11:47.539
So I just want

11:47.574 --> 11:50.350
Oh you know I

11:50.385 --> 11:52.282
Just want to say

11:58.156 --> 11:58.965
Thank you

11:59.000 --> 12:01.576
Sincerity is overwhelming

12:01.711 --> 12:02.770
I think him gonna weep

12:02.805 --> 12:03.525
You know what? Enough

12:06.776 --> 12:07.578
Do not be sarcastic

12:08.113 --> 12:10.537
That was great Doc

12:10.572 --> 12:12.222
You haven't got the time to talk for a long time

12:12.257 --> 12:13.590
You got the gift

12:13.625 --> 12:14.950
It's like writing a book

12:14.985 --> 12:16.568
Churchill is best

12:16.603 --> 12:18.259
I think I made my point

12:18.294 --> 12:21.676
I've moved you too

12:21.711 --> 12:22.881
Stunning

12:25.690 --> 12:27.766
Doc, great to have you back

12:30.080 --> 12:31.346
No better place to be, yeah

13:04.837 --> 13:06.569
About time you boys showed up

13:10.595 --> 13:11.437
Nice boat

13:11.472 --> 13:12.956
Thanks ladies, but I looked myself

13:12.991 --> 13:16.054
Got 3 more just like him patrolling the hub

13:16.089 --> 13:18.200
2 men ground teams every 400m

13:18.235 --> 13:19.638
Good work

13:19.673 --> 13:21.675
Just cause you can fly a plane don't make you smarter than me

13:21.710 --> 13:23.465
I'm sure it does

13:24.695 --> 13:26.813
So you're the reason I've been stuck down here in this shithole

13:26.848 --> 13:27.893
Shithole?

13:29.079 --> 13:30.528
Brother you have no idea

13:31.933 --> 13:32.550
Oh yeah, hahahaha

13:35.117 --> 13:36.076
What the hell is that?

13:36.111 --> 13:38.215
This bitch will solve all your problem

13:38.250 --> 13:39.907
Yeah, maybe for 10 seconds

13:39.942 --> 13:43.038
We're gonna blow this watch -
So now you got that problem too?

13:46.447 --> 13:47.923
You walked into that 1

13:49.544 --> 13:50.713
Come on, look alive, look alive

15:00.842 --> 15:01.547
It was all under control

15:02.282 --> 15:03.512
Yeah, that's what it looked like

15:09.035 --> 15:09.600
Where you've been?

15:09.635 --> 15:11.245
I had a doctors' appointment

15:13.522 --> 15:15.072
Catch up with you boys later

15:16.755 --> 15:17.382
What's he had?

15:28.873 --> 15:30.211
Watch your overhead

15:53.275 --> 15:54.775
Doc go

16:30.684 --> 16:32.475
Ooh sadly, the man attacked me with a knife

16:34.334 --> 16:34.920
He's good

16:34.955 --> 16:35.975
Compared to you

16:41.073 --> 16:42.199
You do not want to see this

16:42.234 --> 16:43.292
See what?

16:43.327 --> 16:44.350
I'll show you

17:17.833 --> 17:18.428
Damn

17:18.463 --> 17:19.484
He's really good

17:19.520 --> 17:20.284
Say it again and I'll shoot you

17:23.588 --> 17:24.554
Get in

17:40.706 --> 17:41.787
Where is the bomb?

17:41.822 --> 17:43.053
It'll be here

17:45.269 --> 17:47.311
Barney looks like the target is right on its time

17:48.884 --> 17:50.497
There is a place in the second

17:53.059 --> 17:54.469
Barney I'm gonna put you down

18:11.480 --> 18:12.603
It can't be

18:12.638 --> 18:13.619
What can't be?

18:13.654 --> 18:15.124
We're gonna shoot this guy or what?

18:15.159 --> 18:16.840
What's the hold up?

18:16.875 --> 18:18.063
He's dead

18:18.098 --> 18:20.348
Who's dead?

18:23.269 --> 18:24.257
Stonebanks

18:28.270 --> 18:29.858
Stonebanks

18:38.551 --> 18:40.067
Come on, get in

18:40.102 --> 18:42.186
Come on, move!
Go go go!

19:02.451 --> 19:03.290
Come

19:04.132 --> 19:05.535
Time to load her up

19:20.935 --> 19:21.706
I told you

19:21.741 --> 19:22.688
10 seconds

19:30.219 --> 19:30.822
Hang on

19:30.857 --> 19:32.013
Found you a ride

19:39.189 --> 19:40.212
Time to go

19:55.862 --> 19:56.623
Come on, go go go!

20:02.777 --> 20:04.020
- How much we're getting pay for this?
- Not enough

20:20.228 --> 20:20.825
Go right

20:50.082 --> 20:51.312
You're not gonna fit

20:51.347 --> 20:52.289
Always negative

21:04.428 --> 21:05.583
I'm getting carsick

21:09.285 --> 21:10.448
Hang on Doc

21:25.366 --> 21:25.890
Get out

21:37.014 --> 21:37.813
Come on

21:48.748 --> 21:49.436
Caesar

21:49.471 --> 21:50.845
We're coming your way, where are you?

21:50.880 --> 21:53.305
In this filthy river, behind you

21:55.408 --> 21:57.099
Try to stay as close as you can

22:02.274 --> 22:03.592
Make room for Caeser

22:04.027 --> 22:06.502
Move your ass in

22:10.637 --> 22:11.367
Who's it?

22:11.402 --> 22:13.197
I think it's my guy on boat

22:19.517 --> 22:20.673
---

22:26.749 --> 22:28.151
Hold it, hold it, you got it going

22:34.517 --> 22:35.888
- You alright?
- Yeah

22:42.224 --> 22:43.239
Turn over

23:28.403 --> 23:30.549
Incoming!

23:31.804 --> 23:32.783
Move!

23:32.818 --> 23:33.981
Move!

23:34.016 --> 23:35.518
We got you man, come on!

26:10.946 --> 26:12.497
Maybe this will bring you luck

26:40.787 --> 26:41.816
Is he gonna make it?

26:41.851 --> 26:43.153
I don't know

26:43.188 --> 26:44.027
Who did this?

26:44.062 --> 26:46.430
Stonebanks

26:48.080 --> 26:49.032
I thought you killed him

26:49.740 --> 26:50.974
So do I

26:52.288 --> 26:53.973
He shot Caeser to get back in me

26:55.631 --> 26:57.535
Yeah I'm getting out of this business

26:57.570 --> 26:59.399
And so should you

27:02.105 --> 27:02.544
Not yet

27:05.176 --> 27:06.583
If you need any help with
Stonebanks

27:26.975 --> 27:28.908
It's supposed to be the guy named Church

27:28.943 --> 27:30.063
I know who you are

27:30.098 --> 27:31.645
So who are you?

27:31.680 --> 27:33.792
Operations officer Drummer

27:35.060 --> 27:37.452
You don't have to worry about Church anymore

27:38.508 --> 27:41.425
He's um, he's out of the picture

27:43.785 --> 27:44.841
Jesus Ross

27:44.876 --> 27:46.575
What a mess

27:47.771 --> 27:48.871
We gave you everything

27:48.906 --> 27:52.953
Target opportunity, all the intel you could asked for

27:52.988 --> 27:56.687
And you got decimated

27:56.722 --> 27:59.331
And my target went away

27:59.366 --> 28:00.588
Am I wrong huh?

28:01.023 --> 28:02.073
Am I missing something?

28:02.108 --> 28:06.545
Yes, sure you said the target name was Victim

28:06.680 --> 28:07.552
- And?
- It was wrong

28:08.387 --> 28:11.067
His real name was Conrad Stonebanks

28:13.247 --> 28:16.372
We knew him only as Victor Maines

28:17.214 --> 28:22.066
Arms dealer, made billions selling to every psycho warlord in Africa and the Middle East

28:22.101 --> 28:26.006
His own mercenary army is personally responsible

28:26.041 --> 28:29.733
For the torture and killing

28:29.768 --> 28:32.253
2 of the best men I ever knew friend

28:33.339 --> 28:35.305
I don't give a shit what his name is

28:35.340 --> 28:36.929
I don't like him

28:37.984 --> 28:39.714
I want him as bad as you do

28:40.981 --> 28:43.367
This happened on my watch

28:43.402 --> 28:48.324
You fucked up, and I'm wearing it

28:51.774 --> 28:53.111
I'll find him

28:53.146 --> 28:54.122
Again

28:54.157 --> 28:56.470
You have 1 more shot

28:59.848 --> 29:01.574
Nice to finally meet you Barney

29:05.746 --> 29:10.325
Your man are shot to shit, what are
you gonna do for a team

29:10.360 --> 29:12.477
Don't worry about it
I'll handle it

29:15.716 --> 29:17.302
Relax

29:18.632 --> 29:20.777
You're gonna give yourself a stroke

29:22.445 --> 29:24.766
What's with these guys

29:24.801 --> 29:26.134
Do you mind?

29:59.864 --> 30:03.575
Do you think when the artist painted this, he ever thought
it would go for such a ridiculous price?

30:04.410 --> 30:09.690
I mean what is this? Just some paint, brushes, some shape,
canvas, what's the big deal?

30:14.611 --> 30:15.911
It's shit

30:15.946 --> 30:16.998
What do you want for it?

30:17.033 --> 30:18.331
3 million

30:18.366 --> 30:20.222
Done

30:29.271 --> 30:30.051
You know

30:30.086 --> 30:32.871
It's very hard for me to say this

30:32.906 --> 30:35.613
But at 1 time, you guys were the best

30:37.013 --> 30:37.995
Maybe still are

30:40.113 --> 30:41.654
But nothing lasts forever

30:45.649 --> 30:48.044
Hard as it is to hear

30:51.252 --> 30:53.077
We're not the future anymore

30:53.112 --> 30:54.773
Unfortunately for us

30:54.808 --> 30:56.526
We're part of the past

31:05.647 --> 31:06.537
As I see it

31:07.472 --> 31:08.542
If we keep this life up

31:10.493 --> 31:12.842
The only this thing ends

31:13.719 --> 31:15.791
Or all of this

31:18.885 --> 31:21.651
Is in a hole in the ground and no 1 giving a shit

31:24.481 --> 31:27.894
Now, if that's the way I'm suppossed to go out,
I can live with that

31:30.387 --> 31:31.259
For me

31:33.837 --> 31:35.552
But what I can't live with

31:36.803 --> 31:38.364
And I won't live with

31:41.001 --> 31:42.971
Is taking you with me

31:43.006 --> 31:45.118
What are you saying?
That's our call

31:45.153 --> 31:47.400
I'm changing things now

31:49.756 --> 31:51.302
You

31:51.337 --> 31:53.094
Me

31:54.442 --> 31:56.091
All of us

31:59.746 --> 32:00.519
It's over

32:00.654 --> 32:02.576
We're done

32:03.111 --> 32:05.543
Done? You ripped me out

32:05.678 --> 32:06.695
Cut me loose

32:06.730 --> 32:08.563
You'll survive

32:08.798 --> 32:10.069
You all will

32:13.028 --> 32:14.894
You live your lives while you can

32:19.808 --> 32:20.871
Where are you going, Barney?

32:32.603 --> 32:34.993
Hey you think you just pulled the plug and that's it?

32:35.028 --> 32:36.571
- Just did.
- Yeah?

32:36.606 --> 32:38.047
Well it doesn't work that way

32:38.082 --> 32:39.356
What?

32:39.391 --> 32:40.830
We've been through the mud

32:40.865 --> 32:42.340
We shit in the blood

32:42.375 --> 32:44.526
And I've saved your arse more times than I can count

32:47.231 --> 32:49.967
You don't want me to shot this this guy that took Caeser down?

32:52.106 --> 32:53.631
We're not doing that

33:00.178 --> 33:00.947
You know when I joined

33:03.374 --> 33:04.599
I joined for the whole ride

33:06.709 --> 33:07.596
I know you did

33:10.414 --> 33:11.570
Rides over

34:32.760 --> 34:34.275
Bonaparte

34:34.310 --> 34:35.920
Sorry to hear about Caeser

34:35.956 --> 34:38.571
I hope you pulls through with the good ones

34:38.606 --> 34:39.342
Yeah

34:39.377 --> 34:41.306
Well here we are again

34:41.342 --> 34:42.216
What do you need?

34:42.251 --> 34:43.445
New Team

34:43.480 --> 34:45.411
Retired the old ones

34:45.447 --> 34:47.454
Welcome to the 21st century

34:48.829 --> 34:50.027
Any guys you looking for?

34:50.062 --> 34:53.331
Young, hungry to take a bullet

34:53.366 --> 34:55.541
We're going after Stonebanks

34:55.576 --> 34:56.179
Stonebanks

34:57.270 --> 35:00.548
Let's see, I'm not the only one sleeping.
Stonebanks is dead my friend

35:01.383 --> 35:02.089
No, he's not

35:05.192 --> 35:05.537
That is not good

35:07.306 --> 35:08.572
If it was half of what it used to be, 5 or 4 ain't gonna cut it

35:09.407 --> 35:10.819
You're gonna need 50

35:10.854 --> 35:12.047
We gotta move fast, no time

35:12.082 --> 35:14.467
If I go to do it fast then I can't guarantee the best

35:14.502 --> 35:16.080
Just give me something, don't give it to him

35:16.115 --> 35:17.523
What?

35:17.558 --> 35:18.575
Was it a 1 way ticket?

35:18.610 --> 35:20.262
Could be

35:20.297 --> 35:22.617
Fine

35:22.652 --> 35:24.825
I got in line with a few head cases

35:25.443 --> 35:27.588
Couple of these guys are crying up to shoot themselves

35:28.818 --> 35:29.420
Wait

35:29.455 --> 35:31.847
What about these guys?
They're anything?

35:31.882 --> 35:32.718
These guys are pussies

35:39.436 --> 35:42.555
Foreign, expert hacker

35:42.590 --> 35:43.853
Commander pilot

35:43.888 --> 35:46.516
Did 18 month for hacking in Seattle central operating systems

35:46.608 --> 35:48.545
Shut down the whole city for 3 days

35:48.580 --> 35:50.022
Why the hell would he do that?

35:50.057 --> 35:51.284
Because he can

35:53.784 --> 35:54.341
What?

35:55.565 --> 35:57.392
I'm not looking for an office worker

35:57.427 --> 35:58.712
Oh that's not him

36:06.390 --> 36:09.732
Another 1 with a death wish.
You 2 got a lot in common.

36:12.703 --> 36:13.483
I can't do that

36:21.853 --> 36:22.653
You know what?

36:22.688 --> 36:23.882
I'm gonna come around and I'll say it

36:23.917 --> 36:25.670
I belong on you

36:36.807 --> 36:38.877
- You can't do that.
- No.

36:38.912 --> 36:40.879
He was special on that 1

36:40.914 --> 36:43.438
Yeah, yeah, that's the p-----

36:46.173 --> 36:49.728
Always on the damn road going someplace you don't give a damn about

36:49.763 --> 36:51.027
Beat standing still

36:51.062 --> 36:52.284
Yeah I got 2 ex-wives

36:52.319 --> 36:54.392
- and 3 kids I've lost my numbers with disagree

36:59.981 --> 37:02.514
- Hey did you turned off the autopilot?
- I didn't touch the autopilot.

37:02.949 --> 37:04.000
Read this

37:04.810 --> 37:05.531
Are we off course?

37:07.759 --> 37:09.641
Where the hell are we?
Hang on for a second

37:10.587 --> 37:12.568
Is that the Big Dipper?

37:12.603 --> 37:13.931
Yeah we gotta turn around

37:16.345 --> 37:20.203
Next candidate is an expert in field craft and close quarters combat

37:22.478 --> 37:23.258
Luna

37:23.293 --> 37:24.254
Hi

37:24.289 --> 37:27.209
Young lady, meet a friend of mine. Barney Ross.
Barney Ross, Luna. Luna, Barney Ross.

37:27.244 --> 37:29.457
Nice to meet you Mr. Ross

37:29.492 --> 37:31.789
Gentlemen if you'd follow me

37:31.824 --> 37:33.606
Come on

37:34.554 --> 37:35.503
So Luna how are things?

37:35.538 --> 37:37.270
The same thing

37:37.305 --> 37:39.259
What do you do?

37:40.946 --> 37:42.774
Forget this

37:44.136 --> 37:45.572
All right so what are we doing here?

37:45.607 --> 37:46.597
Have a drink

37:47.407 --> 37:48.569
Where's your candidate?

37:48.604 --> 37:52.008
Right there in the red dress about to chop those guys in half

37:56.046 --> 37:58.544
- The hostess?
- Not the hostess

37:58.579 --> 37:59.586
She's the bouncer

38:20.948 --> 38:22.031
I can't do that

38:22.066 --> 38:23.542
You want to slip on a dress and give it a shot

38:27.612 --> 38:28.483
Men

38:32.404 --> 38:33.459
She's good

38:33.494 --> 38:35.531
You wanna see her without heels

38:43.646 --> 38:45.155
When did you last checkup?

38:45.437 --> 38:46.992
I don't know, a while back

38:47.027 --> 38:49.100
Our cholesterol ---

38:49.135 --> 38:50.083
Yeah pretty much

38:50.118 --> 38:51.418
Except with me

38:53.427 --> 38:54.687
I've found a lump in my lung

38:56.553 --> 38:58.026
Buried dark they said

38:58.061 --> 39:00.563
Why shouldn't I see that coming?

39:02.743 --> 39:05.553
Well, what do you do?

39:05.688 --> 39:08.544
I try to make as much money as I can,
fast as I can.

39:08.579 --> 39:11.247
For those kids you know
The 1 you don't talk to

39:11.282 --> 39:13.607
Make some kind of a good impression on them, before I'm gone

39:16.457 --> 39:17.829
Sad isn't it?

39:17.864 --> 39:19.805
Yeah it is sad. I'm sorry.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.844
Nah that's all bullshit, I'm fine

39:21.879 --> 39:23.948
Just checking you're still human

39:29.472 --> 39:30.979
Had you going there now didn't you?

39:31.014 --> 39:32.455
Yeah you did goddammit

39:32.490 --> 39:34.916
That can never happen again
I'll never trust you again

39:34.951 --> 39:37.067
Next kid has a bit of a dark force

39:37.102 --> 39:41.050
Just came across my desk. I don't like throwing in a wildcard.

39:41.085 --> 39:43.551
But this guy is too much to just passed up

39:45.099 --> 39:46.506
Anybody see Felipe

39:48.751 --> 39:51.041
Yo Felipe

39:58.422 --> 39:59.581
This gotta be good Bonaparte

40:00.627 --> 40:01.541
Yeah I bet

40:01.576 --> 40:03.552
Finally got it right

40:09.701 --> 40:10.799
Damn

40:16.702 --> 40:17.362
(In advance)

40:17.397 --> 40:18.723
Meet Barney Ross

40:22.866 --> 40:24.975
Galgo, you sent me another fake resume

40:25.010 --> 40:28.981
Mr. Ross I can do what you need, whatever you need

40:29.016 --> 40:31.265
I am healthier than I look, stronger than I look

40:31.300 --> 40:32.566
Faster than I look

40:32.601 --> 40:35.450
Actually, shit, you were born in 1984

40:35.485 --> 40:36.539
Of course not

40:36.574 --> 40:38.574
But I feel like that I was born in 1984

40:38.609 --> 40:40.405
Do not waste your time, Barney we leave

40:40.440 --> 40:41.994
Mr. Ross, Mr. Ross, Mr. Ross

40:42.029 --> 40:43.622
Please

40:43.657 --> 40:47.735
It's like uh, it's like I have this uh, called the fountain of youth

40:47.770 --> 40:50.975
I mean, not the fountain of youth

40:51.010 --> 40:53.075
Ponce de Leon

40:53.110 --> 40:54.341
Um by the way

40:54.376 --> 40:57.723
I know a little Spanish

40:57.758 --> 40:59.961
Mr. Ross

40:59.996 --> 41:03.571
Age is just a state of mind

41:05.172 --> 41:07.597
You're only old, when you surrender

41:07.632 --> 41:10.772
When you give up, and I haven't, not yet

41:10.807 --> 41:12.455
- Galgo, this shit has got to stop
- I gotta go

41:12.490 --> 41:13.926
This is the third time this month

41:13.961 --> 41:15.755
Seriously, moved on

41:15.790 --> 41:17.580
What's this guy story?

41:17.615 --> 41:19.131
Actually I feel a little sorry for him

41:19.166 --> 41:20.431
His last team dropped him

41:20.466 --> 41:22.819
Back in the day, you couldn't catch him

41:22.854 --> 41:25.710
- Very fast, maybe even faster than you
- No way

41:25.745 --> 41:26.595
Oh maybe

41:26.630 --> 41:28.175
But, what am I gonna say

41:28.210 --> 41:29.683
It's a young man's game

41:31.645 --> 41:33.082
I need a job!

41:33.117 --> 41:39.239
All I know what to do is killing people
And I do that very well

41:39.274 --> 41:42.015
Damn

41:49.635 --> 41:54.429
- What's the story on this guy?
- Found him in DARPA

41:54.464 --> 41:56.644
- DARPA?
- Sounds like a town in North Africa

41:56.679 --> 41:59.486
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency

41:59.521 --> 42:02.589
Now that's where the brightest military minds develop next-gen weapons

42:02.724 --> 42:04.563
Google it

42:04.798 --> 42:06.555
I'm not looking for weapons nerd

42:08.079 --> 42:09.558
Ah, then you've come to the right place

42:14.312 --> 42:15.061
Yo Marlito

42:23.462 --> 42:25.051
Mars I like you to meet Barney Ross

42:25.086 --> 42:27.584
Now truth is, Mars is as gifted as they get

42:27.619 --> 42:28.746
Whatever you say

42:29.621 --> 42:30.463
What do you say?

42:30.498 --> 42:33.301
What I've got here is an X-25 assault rifle

42:33.336 --> 42:36.185
Laser range, 25mm high explosive burst rounds

42:36.220 --> 42:38.721
Can be programmed to detonate over or behind the target

42:48.952 --> 42:49.689
He'll do

42:53.294 --> 42:57.481
Final candidate, John Smilee.
Guy's got the most in the industry.

42:57.516 --> 43:00.595
A lot of skills, Marines, special operator

43:01.030 --> 43:02.542
- But there is, an issue
- What issue?

43:03.277 --> 43:06.545
Yeah classic authority problem

43:09.002 --> 43:11.074
There's a couple more swimming around in there too

43:41.370 --> 43:45.018
Sorry Barney for wasting your time like this.
He's not the guy I thought he was.

43:45.053 --> 43:46.270
No

43:46.305 --> 43:47.302
I want to meet him

43:55.834 --> 43:56.577
John

43:56.612 --> 43:58.507
Meet Barney Ross

44:00.365 --> 44:02.557
Didn't do much to impress out there today didn't you?

44:03.292 --> 44:05.578
You called me, I didn't call you

44:05.613 --> 44:07.517
Think you'd die for the money?

44:09.448 --> 44:11.659
Maybe you like getting your ass kicked in front of strangers

44:21.747 --> 44:23.197
What do you guys want from me?

44:24.625 --> 44:25.854
You running from something?

44:26.832 --> 44:28.309
I don't know you

44:28.344 --> 44:29.517
But I know you

44:29.552 --> 44:30.503
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah

44:30.538 --> 44:31.237
How's that

44:31.272 --> 44:34.653
Maybe he thinks you got potential and we're short on time.
That's about right?

44:34.688 --> 44:36.057
That's about it

44:36.092 --> 44:37.509
What's your problem?

44:37.544 --> 44:41.130
Your problem is you're rolling around the dirt for chump change

44:42.465 --> 44:44.853
I hear you lost a few friends in the desert

44:44.888 --> 44:47.099
They bought it, and you didn't

44:47.134 --> 44:48.223
And you wear the guilt

44:49.271 --> 44:50.577
I've been there

44:50.612 --> 44:52.162
He's been there

44:52.197 --> 44:54.021
We all lived it

44:55.249 --> 44:57.251
Well you don't know me

44:57.286 --> 44:58.957
I know the type

45:08.240 --> 45:09.784
Bonaparte you're right

45:11.935 --> 45:12.956
He did waste my time

45:25.299 --> 45:26.432
Hey, you didn't waste your time

45:43.262 --> 45:46.430
If we're going after Stonebanks,
we might want to talk about financials now

45:46.465 --> 45:48.760
Normally it's just 10%, but

45:48.795 --> 45:55.300
I figured with Stonebanks in the equation I might want to get my fee possibly now

45:57.014 --> 46:00.279
I mean, not that you're not good for it,
just, if you don't mind

46:00.314 --> 46:01.579
I don't mind

46:02.114 --> 46:04.524
It sounds like you don't have too much faith in me

46:04.859 --> 46:06.965
I don't

46:35.681 --> 46:37.294
How was your occassion?

46:37.329 --> 46:38.780
Ready to go to work?

46:38.815 --> 46:40.184
You find them yet?

46:40.219 --> 46:43.694
He's in Bucharest putting together a deal with some Albanian mobster

46:43.729 --> 46:46.287
And get 36 hours, that's your window

46:46.676 --> 46:48.362
After that he's back off the gird

46:48.397 --> 46:50.427
Satellite map

46:50.462 --> 46:52.639
Coordinates for where he'll be

46:54.287 --> 46:55.728
Interesting guy

46:56.843 --> 46:58.432
Your friend Stonebanks

46:58.467 --> 46:59.590
You're not gonna like this but

47:00.325 --> 47:01.566
They want him alive

47:01.801 --> 47:03.535
Are you kidding me?

47:03.770 --> 47:05.540
They want to try him at Hague

47:07.613 --> 47:08.568
For war crimes

47:08.803 --> 47:11.996
You're gonna give this guy a chance in court?

47:12.031 --> 47:12.876
It's not my decision

47:15.409 --> 47:18.547
- Now never is
- That's the way it's gotta be

47:19.916 --> 47:23.425
Agency's got a local safehouse

47:24.516 --> 47:25.906
You're gonna need it

47:27.097 --> 47:28.598
Don't trash the place

48:14.394 --> 48:15.298
I heard you got a job

48:15.333 --> 48:16.386
That's right

48:17.549 --> 48:19.033
Who the hell are they?

48:19.068 --> 48:20.363
They're with me

48:23.453 --> 48:24.756
And we're not?

48:24.791 --> 48:27.885
Gunner I had told you everything I had to tell you back in the bar

48:27.920 --> 48:28.940
Stop drinking so much

48:30.207 --> 48:32.163
You want to get yourself killed

48:32.198 --> 48:33.859
With those youngsters

48:36.103 --> 48:37.864
Do us all a favor and get the hell out of here

48:41.211 --> 48:42.371
Wheels up in 10

48:53.337 --> 48:54.880
If your guys wanted to fight,

48:54.915 --> 48:56.532
why didn't they just get married?

48:57.066 --> 49:00.103
You seriously somking next to aviation fuel?

49:07.625 --> 49:08.586
Amateur

49:08.921 --> 49:11.271
Amateur assholes

49:11.767 --> 49:13.158
Balugd calls from my grandfather?

49:14.015 --> 49:16.761
Grandpa's about to crash your windpipe

49:19.363 --> 49:21.147
What is this? It's your toy?

49:21.182 --> 49:22.730
Boy?

49:22.765 --> 49:24.910
You want to dance big guy?

49:27.023 --> 49:28.637
Hey! It's just a job

49:39.000 --> 49:40.235
You're young and you're dumb

49:48.118 --> 49:49.823
Jingling jingling

49:51.999 --> 49:52.844
Keep it

49:54.254 --> 49:55.309
You're gonna need it

50:05.947 --> 50:07.555
Never thought you'll be calling that favor

50:07.990 --> 50:10.039
I'm also not happy about it

50:46.717 --> 50:47.771
Got a minute?

50:51.057 --> 50:52.120
What do you need?

50:52.155 --> 50:54.826
Tell me more about this gut we're going after

50:54.861 --> 50:57.590
It doesn't matter you're hired to do a job

50:59.980 --> 51:01.551
What about answering why we're doing this job?

51:06.488 --> 51:08.503
I owe you a salary that's it

51:11.802 --> 51:13.811
Why are we going after Stonebanks?

51:13.846 --> 51:16.493
You have a hard time taking orders don't you?

51:16.528 --> 51:18.327
If I don't know what they are, yeah

51:22.817 --> 51:24.482
I know you don't give a damn about us

51:24.517 --> 51:25.857
I get that

51:26.389 --> 51:30.359
But just tell me why you want to take out this guy so bad

53:30.186 --> 53:31.656
30s to drop

53:31.691 --> 53:32.824
Copy that

53:34.227 --> 53:34.579
Let's go

53:40.160 --> 53:41.314
I can take care of myself

53:41.349 --> 53:43.218
20s to drop

53:48.557 --> 53:49.970
10s

54:49.485 --> 54:50.854
We're on

55:01.618 --> 55:03.269
This guy got more muscle than a cartel king

55:03.304 --> 55:04.593
Maybe he's up for a competition or something

55:05.028 --> 55:06.526
What you're drinking Barney?
Is that like vanilla latte or somehting?

55:07.061 --> 55:07.516
Stay sharp

55:08.983 --> 55:09.716
Moved

55:09.751 --> 55:12.497
You have to think about this again Mr.

55:12.532 --> 55:14.786
I promise you this won't happen again

55:14.821 --> 55:16.124
Move the cart

55:38.173 --> 55:39.396
Nice driving Mars

55:39.431 --> 55:40.660
Good performance

55:40.695 --> 55:42.214
Yeah, too good

55:42.249 --> 55:43.876
Any closer and I'd beat his ass

55:43.911 --> 55:44.939
I believe her

55:44.974 --> 55:46.025
Got 'em

55:54.891 --> 55:56.851
Oh man, this guy's protected better than the president

55:56.886 --> 55:58.712
Yeah, it's like a 5-star fortress

55:58.747 --> 55:59.534
Listen we're not gonna taking him there

56:00.369 --> 56:02.561
I bet the hotel is full of guests

56:02.796 --> 56:03.512
So where do we hit them?

56:03.847 --> 56:04.507
At the meet

56:05.142 --> 56:06.549
We'll hit them on all 4 sides

56:07.284 --> 56:08.483
Hit him hard

56:09.785 --> 56:10.630
Ok, um, so

56:10.665 --> 56:15.469
Our plan is to what? Kick down the door and start spraying bullet?

56:15.504 --> 56:16.484
It's a great plan

56:16.519 --> 56:17.781
If it's 1985

56:17.816 --> 56:19.042
And what's that supposed to mean?

56:20.456 --> 56:21.329
You heard me

56:24.956 --> 56:27.029
You got a better plan?

56:27.064 --> 56:28.013
Much better

56:28.048 --> 56:29.252
Let's hear it

56:29.287 --> 56:30.971
Thorn, you're up

56:32.631 --> 56:33.831
Ok, I'm the plan

56:36.573 --> 56:37.455
This better be good

56:37.490 --> 56:39.353
First I hacked the security grid main server, boom

56:39.388 --> 56:42.515
Bypassed the motion detector laser and biometric sensors, pow

56:42.550 --> 56:46.481
Override the surveillance videos and CCTV systems, ba-bam

56:46.516 --> 56:48.130
An we are in

56:49.756 --> 56:51.506
It's child play

56:51.541 --> 56:53.519
Just like that?

56:53.554 --> 56:54.578
Just like that

56:54.613 --> 56:56.165
Just like that

56:56.166 --> 56:58.228
Exactly, like that

57:04.417 --> 57:04.598
You better be right

57:08.928 --> 57:09.703
Let's go

57:38.264 --> 57:39.489
So why'd you let your team go?

57:42.511 --> 57:45.397
It was time

57:45.432 --> 57:47.647
They didn't seem to happy about it

57:48.521 --> 57:51.054
If you're looking to go the family route,

57:53.870 --> 57:55.418
it's the wrong job for you

57:55.453 --> 57:58.622
There are different kinds of family

58:00.586 --> 58:02.060
And when my life is on the line

58:03.075 --> 58:04.598
That's my family fighting with me

58:12.013 --> 58:12.996
You know what I mean

58:13.031 --> 58:15.421
Yeah, I know what you mean

58:31.313 --> 58:32.763
Right on time

58:37.121 --> 58:38.216
Ladies First

58:38.251 --> 58:39.627
Go ahead the Thorn

58:39.662 --> 58:40.807
Will you shut up and get in this sewer

59:54.300 --> 59:57.710
And ladies and gentlemen, we officially have eyes in the skies

59:57.745 --> 59:58.720
Copy that

59:58.755 --> 59:59.527
Let's do this

01:00:00.162 --> 01:00:00.568
Thought you'd never ask

01:00:42.492 --> 01:00:43.013
Good to go

01:00:45.538 --> 01:00:45.994
Good luck boys

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.593
Heck

01:01:08.128 --> 01:01:08.868
What's the problem?

01:01:08.903 --> 01:01:10.759
The buyer, they're early

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.316
Threat just doubled

01:01:27.729 --> 01:01:28.713
You're early

01:01:30.089 --> 01:01:31.954
What do you think?

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:35.122
It's ok

01:01:45.074 --> 01:01:46.461
When Cain's the little brother

01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:49.697
God banish him from civilization

01:01:49.732 --> 01:01:52.189
But before that he placed a mark on him

01:01:53.907 --> 01:01:55.542
---

01:01:56.593 --> 01:01:59.019
It protect him from roving hunters

01:02:01.655 --> 01:02:02.596
This is not X-ray artwork

01:02:04.156 --> 01:02:04.548
Only oils

01:02:05.383 --> 01:02:06.080
Very good

01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:10.224
There you have it

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:11.490
Gabil

01:02:12.621 --> 01:02:13.154
My pleasure

01:02:13.189 --> 01:02:13.924
As always

01:02:16.656 --> 01:02:21.052
Can you access nuclear weapons?

01:02:26.115 --> 01:02:26.959
I might

01:02:27.842 --> 01:02:31.360
But generally I find people a little too emotional for ownership

01:02:32.594 --> 01:02:35.125
And I'd hate you killing all my other customers by accident

01:02:35.823 --> 01:02:36.983
Or on purpose

01:02:39.341 --> 01:02:40.511
In position

01:02:42.811 --> 01:02:43.903
In position

01:02:44.569 --> 01:02:45.451
Set

01:02:45.486 --> 01:02:46.891
I'll pay you what you want

01:02:48.178 --> 01:02:49.022
Let me think about it

01:02:52.399 --> 01:02:53.354
We're on

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:11.314
Stonebanks is moving, watch it

01:03:15.393 --> 01:03:17.572
I will do this

01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:25.189
Try again

01:03:26.739 --> 01:03:28.603
Open Sesame

01:03:31.133 --> 01:03:32.082
Go go go

01:03:34.014 --> 01:03:35.467
Move

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.219
Go

01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:52.873
Barney Ross says hello

01:04:00.943 --> 01:04:02.034
Nice job

01:04:05.473 --> 01:04:05.536
Trench you copy?

01:04:07.868 --> 01:04:08.573
I'm waiting

01:04:09.308 --> 01:04:10.860
Got it secured

01:04:10.895 --> 01:04:12.343
I'll hurry up

01:04:12.378 --> 01:04:13.291
It's boring

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.061
Why don't you just a bullet in his head and be done with it

01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:37.401
Hey you said we're just taking them out

01:04:40.847 --> 01:04:41.585
Good morning

01:04:46.755 --> 01:04:48.684
These are your students?

01:04:48.719 --> 01:04:50.952
Hey kids what you learnt tonight huh?

01:04:52.081 --> 01:04:53.637
What happened to the old crew?

01:04:53.672 --> 01:04:55.533
Oh that's right

01:04:55.568 --> 01:04:59.572
They stuck their noses into other people's world and got fatally injured

01:05:00.107 --> 01:05:02.499
Now they're The Deletables

01:05:02.534 --> 01:05:04.567
Hey you hear that kids?

01:05:04.602 --> 01:05:06.577
Take note cause that what you're doing right now

01:05:07.312 --> 01:05:08.569
Let me show him

01:05:08.904 --> 01:05:12.363
You're talking pretty tough your guys incapacitated which is good for you

01:05:12.398 --> 01:05:16.504
Why don't you cut me loose and I'll open your meat shirt and show you your own heart

01:05:18.618 --> 01:05:19.996
Hey Barney

01:05:21.575 --> 01:05:24.141
Why don't the 2 of us just end this? What do you say?

01:05:24.176 --> 01:05:28.609
Mix it up, either you snapping my spine or me snapping yours

01:05:28.644 --> 01:05:30.507
You know, make it snappy

01:05:32.163 --> 01:05:33.884
He thinks I'm joking.
I'm not joking.

01:05:33.919 --> 01:05:35.461
You should see me when I'm angry

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:37.067
You'd be very impressed

01:05:37.102 --> 01:05:38.661
And very dead

01:05:40.661 --> 01:05:41.327
So come on pal

01:05:41.362 --> 01:05:44.126
Anything you want to get off your chest

01:05:46.405 --> 01:05:47.303
Come on, lay it out

01:05:47.338 --> 01:05:48.812
I'm a good listener

01:05:51.692 --> 01:05:53.834
You're gonna take me back to the has been crew?

01:05:53.869 --> 01:05:55.481
Carved me up around the fire

01:05:55.516 --> 01:05:57.135
Very tribal

01:06:03.044 --> 01:06:04.584
When we stop, I wanna break every bone on your body

01:06:05.019 --> 01:06:07.527
And drop what's left at The Hague

01:06:08.362 --> 01:06:13.396
The Hague

01:06:13.431 --> 01:06:15.299
I'm a war criminal

01:06:15.334 --> 01:06:16.382
Keep laughing

01:06:18.526 --> 01:06:20.325
Do you think,

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.559
that you could just deliver me like a package?

01:06:29.671 --> 01:06:31.597
We were close once

01:06:31.632 --> 01:06:34.014
See we started this whole Expendables thing together, see?

01:06:34.049 --> 01:06:35.626
Look I've got the marks

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:40.852
It's been faded but, we had a falling out

01:06:40.887 --> 01:06:42.005
You went dark

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.267
And to dark business Barney don't pretend you're not in it

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:48.646
The baddest survive, those are the rules, I didn't make them up

01:06:49.568 --> 01:06:52.693
You see Barney here was content to work for the small end money

01:06:52.728 --> 01:06:54.139
As an employee

01:06:54.174 --> 01:06:58.246
Now being boss is more lucrative but that's a concept that somehow eluded you

01:06:58.281 --> 01:07:01.269
Plus you got that pesky moral conscience

01:07:01.304 --> 01:07:03.229
God that stuff gets in the way

01:07:03.264 --> 01:07:04.601
He thinks he's the good guy

01:07:04.636 --> 01:07:05.544
Keep talking while you can

01:07:06.079 --> 01:07:08.566
Sure, you got a conscience that makes you weak

01:07:08.601 --> 01:07:10.816
Success, real success

01:07:10.851 --> 01:07:13.802
Is being willing to do the things that other people are not

01:07:13.837 --> 01:07:15.816
Not everyone's as sick as you

01:07:15.851 --> 01:07:17.857
Oh, but you are

01:07:17.892 --> 01:07:20.183
Kill any Barney

01:07:20.218 --> 01:07:22.232
Blow any shit up

01:07:22.267 --> 01:07:24.538
How bout you kids? Killed anyone?

01:07:24.573 --> 01:07:28.934
Before you all start grabbing bricks to stone me at The Hague

01:07:28.969 --> 01:07:32.359
You might want to check your own hands for blood

01:07:34.774 --> 01:07:36.600
But I digress. Where was I?

01:07:36.635 --> 01:07:38.702
Yes, business is booming right?

01:07:38.737 --> 01:07:41.271
A chopper here, a missile there, guns

01:07:41.306 --> 01:07:43.443
Whatever, when suddenly

01:07:43.478 --> 01:07:44.534
a competitor

01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:46.576
I've been calling Uncle Sam a competitor

01:07:46.611 --> 01:07:50.614
Hires my own team. Barney and the whole gang to whack me.

01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:54.194
Things got ugly real fast and a lot of poeple got dead

01:07:54.229 --> 01:07:55.904
3 former brothers in arms

01:07:55.939 --> 01:07:58.021
- Shut your mouth.
- 3 Expendables

01:07:58.056 --> 01:08:00.550
Our brothers, men we ate with, fart with, bled with, dead!

01:08:01.085 --> 01:08:05.572
He puts 3 slugs into my chest thank God for body armor even I thought I was dead

01:08:06.507 --> 01:08:11.527
And then he b--- it out with the casualty, all dead!
Because you couldn't stay out of my business!

01:08:11.562 --> 01:08:13.782
Shut your mouth!

01:08:13.817 --> 01:08:15.338
Go on, do it!

01:08:15.373 --> 01:08:16.471
Go on!

01:08:32.393 --> 01:08:33.615
It's hard enough to fathom

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:35.142
I can't believe you forgot

01:08:35.176 --> 01:08:36.308
What?

01:08:36.343 --> 01:08:39.877
That it's hard to beat an enemy when you're living inside your own head

01:08:39.912 --> 01:08:42.975
You see you tie me up

01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:44.423
Like an animal

01:08:44.457 --> 01:08:47.270
Leave me to the slaughter. You humiliate me. Disgrace me.

01:08:47.305 --> 01:08:49.697
And when the time comes to kill you

01:08:49.732 --> 01:08:53.176
And it will. I will not use a weapon. I will use my hand

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:56.162
Because I want you to feel the way that I feel right now

01:08:59.889 --> 01:09:00.595
Just cause we were brothers

01:09:06.604 --> 01:09:07.156
What's that?

01:09:07.191 --> 01:09:10.144
It's GPS tracker

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:11.379
How about that?

01:10:32.842 --> 01:10:33.728
Hold it

01:10:35.518 --> 01:10:36.248
We may need them

01:10:37.548 --> 01:10:38.845
I need a body find them

01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:05.526
- What happened?
- We found a shitstorm

01:12:07.611 --> 01:12:08.504
It's gonna getting worse

01:12:08.839 --> 01:12:11.672
This come in for you, 10 minutes ago

01:12:15.153 --> 01:12:16.943
Hey Barney

01:12:16.978 --> 01:12:19.896
My search party's dead so I'm taking it you're still with us

01:12:19.931 --> 01:12:23.938
Now you should've killed me where you had the chance cause that's your last window, and it's gone

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:26.083
Now, I got something to show you here

01:12:46.207 --> 01:12:49.469
You want them?

01:12:49.504 --> 01:12:50.810
Come get them

01:12:52.143 --> 01:12:52.988
What are you gonna do?

01:13:21.879 --> 01:13:24.346
Wow, looking a little strung out there kids

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.462
And this is what you get for being pawns in Barney's moral chess game

01:13:30.866 --> 01:13:32.132
That 1 looks a little slack

01:13:38.494 --> 01:13:40.244
You know I feel most bad for you

01:13:40.279 --> 01:13:42.528
I don't give a shit how you feel

01:13:42.563 --> 01:13:44.495
I do, I have a daughter

01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:46.538
I had feelings, anyway

01:13:46.573 --> 01:13:50.008
You know, when the CIA, I, er
presume that's who you're working for

01:13:50.043 --> 01:13:51.854
Am I right?

01:13:54.102 --> 01:13:55.689
I bet you don't even know who you're working for

01:13:55.724 --> 01:13:58.008
But for Barney?

01:13:58.043 --> 01:14:00.249
Do you know who's he working for?

01:14:02.375 --> 01:14:03.501
Does he know who's he working for?

01:14:03.536 --> 01:14:04.592
It gets very confusing

01:14:05.127 --> 01:14:08.607
Anyway, when the CIA wanted guys doing the dangerous work

01:14:08.642 --> 01:14:10.179
in the dangerous places,

01:14:10.214 --> 01:14:12.143
they called us. When they didn't want to get their hands dirty,

01:14:13.344 --> 01:14:14.650
they called us.

01:14:14.685 --> 01:14:18.141
Yup, we cleared every hotspot they had

01:14:18.176 --> 01:14:22.404
We bumped the bad guys so that the good guys could rolled in looking like heroes

01:14:27.775 --> 01:14:28.727
We killed a lot

01:14:30.093 --> 01:14:31.921
But we saved more lives

01:14:31.956 --> 01:14:36.484
Than you can possibly imagined

01:14:36.519 --> 01:14:40.301
Then the boys on the hills wanting no loose ends

01:14:40.954 --> 01:14:42.262
Tried to bury me

01:14:43.703 --> 01:14:45.071
I was an American

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:46.804
Working for America

01:14:47.962 --> 01:14:48.649
What's?

01:14:50.716 --> 01:14:52.236
They'd eat their own children

01:14:54.236 --> 01:14:55.450
The lesson here is

01:14:56.636 --> 01:14:59.800
Never do business with the government

01:15:01.976 --> 01:15:03.553
Never gonna save you that heartache

01:15:05.104 --> 01:15:05.521
Never will

01:15:19.633 --> 01:15:20.864
So you're getting your old team?

01:15:20.899 --> 01:15:22.092
Nah, I've burned that bridge

01:15:22.127 --> 01:15:24.372
You know your pride is gonna get you killed

01:15:24.407 --> 01:15:25.427
Better me than them

01:15:26.738 --> 01:15:28.361
- So you're really gonna go back?
- Yeah

01:15:28.396 --> 01:15:29.838
- Alone?
- Yeah

01:15:30.966 --> 01:15:32.057
You're an idiot

01:15:32.656 --> 01:15:34.027
Thanks for showing up

01:15:35.504 --> 01:15:37.021
The I guess our favors are done

01:15:41.059 --> 01:15:42.784
But you're still an idiot

01:16:10.908 --> 01:16:12.044
The hell did you find me?

01:16:13.557 --> 01:16:14.924
People talks

01:16:14.959 --> 01:16:15.833
I hear things

01:16:15.868 --> 01:16:17.626
You got a mission

01:16:17.661 --> 01:16:19.173
I can help

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:21.802
My name is Galgo

01:16:21.837 --> 01:16:23.482
Let me fill you in

01:16:23.517 --> 01:16:25.878
I am good, very good

01:16:25.913 --> 01:16:27.177
At warfare

01:16:27.212 --> 01:16:29.322
You know good memory, afraid of nothing

01:16:29.357 --> 01:16:32.171
I want to be your friend

01:16:32.206 --> 01:16:33.820
I don't need a friend

01:16:34.872 --> 01:16:36.145
Yes, you do

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:38.111
Everybody does

01:16:38.146 --> 01:16:42.718
I don't have any friends
That's why I know

01:16:42.753 --> 01:16:45.217
Besides my friendship issues,

01:16:45.252 --> 01:16:47.888
what I really need now is somehting to do

01:16:47.923 --> 01:16:50.493
Well not just anything but

01:16:51.657 --> 01:16:53.206
what I was born to do

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:55.039
It was a 1 way trip

01:16:55.074 --> 01:16:56.896
Excuse me sir, but

01:16:56.931 --> 01:16:59.007
1 way trip

01:16:59.042 --> 01:17:00.513
is better than no way

01:17:00.648 --> 01:17:02.554
which is the way I live now

01:17:10.265 --> 01:17:11.129
Help me with the crate

01:17:13.757 --> 01:17:15.128
I'm sorry

01:17:17.426 --> 01:17:18.995
On the plane Gogo

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:22.398
On the plane, yes. But Gogo no Gogo, Galgo.

01:17:23.592 --> 01:17:25.350
- Galgo.
- Gogo sounds like a Parisian hooker.

01:17:38.677 --> 01:17:40.745
I am the bridegroom of death

01:17:41.516 --> 01:17:44.368
The lyrics of a spanish legion old songs

01:17:44.403 --> 01:17:46.482
that we used to sing when we're on a mission in Croatia

01:17:46.517 --> 01:17:48.942
That's where I met Mingo

01:17:50.106 --> 01:17:52.031
The best point man ever

01:17:53.325 --> 01:17:55.414
Some kind of servant you know, ambush

01:17:55.449 --> 01:17:57.492
under fire

01:17:57.527 --> 01:17:59.146
The coolest cat ever

01:17:59.181 --> 01:18:00.551
Just pure eyes in his veins

01:18:01.186 --> 01:18:03.521
We were pinned down once like 2 bullets left

01:18:04.456 --> 01:18:05.515
I looked over

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:07.596
No 1 bit of sweat

01:18:12.853 --> 01:18:14.099
Yeah

01:18:14.134 --> 01:18:15.790
Can I help you up there

01:18:15.825 --> 01:18:17.335
You're a mechanic now?

01:18:17.370 --> 01:18:20.329
Of course I am a mechanic. I am whatever you need me to be sir.

01:18:20.364 --> 01:18:22.195
Ok then just be quiet.

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.743
Yes, sir

01:18:23.778 --> 01:18:24.685
Tiger,

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:26.227
This sniper I knew

01:18:26.262 --> 01:18:27.946
I mean, this guy got it all figured out

01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:30.161
Wind speed, temperature

01:18:30.196 --> 01:18:32.904
Barometric pressure

01:18:32.939 --> 01:18:35.366
But you know what he says the most important?

01:18:35.401 --> 01:18:36.312
No

01:18:36.347 --> 01:18:37.540
Patience

01:18:37.575 --> 01:18:39.016
Really?

01:18:39.051 --> 01:18:40.174
Yes, I've said this

01:18:40.209 --> 01:18:44.890
This thing smells good, what is that?
Kerosene? Gasoline?

01:18:44.925 --> 01:18:47.325
Aviation fuel

01:18:48.585 --> 01:18:50.274
It's good

01:18:52.439 --> 01:18:56.369
The best team member ever, his name was Torres

01:18:56.404 --> 01:18:57.714
Holy shit

01:18:57.749 --> 01:18:59.966
You wouldn't believe what this guy was capable to do

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:01.505
Un-believable

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.054
I'm telling you, man.

01:19:03.089 --> 01:19:03.566
- Galgo?
- Yes, sir

01:19:04.001 --> 01:19:05.930
I think I know why your team let you go

01:19:08.414 --> 01:19:08.544
You do?

01:19:09.179 --> 01:19:11.005
Really?

01:19:13.901 --> 01:19:14.564
Yes

01:19:24.618 --> 01:19:25.942
Last chance

01:19:25.977 --> 01:19:27.533
You sure you want to do this?

01:19:29.219 --> 01:19:30.444
I like travelling

01:19:30.479 --> 01:19:31.395
Good

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.998
Uh, who are those guys?

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.439
My old team

01:20:00.258 --> 01:20:01.525
What the hell are you doing here?

01:20:02.936 --> 01:20:05.586
You're stupid enough to get yourself into this mess

01:20:06.237 --> 01:20:08.573
We're trying to get you out of it

01:20:11.904 --> 01:20:12.652
Come on

01:20:12.687 --> 01:20:14.059
We leave for war

01:20:22.142 --> 01:20:25.161
Galgo you might want to get out of that seat, Christmas is coming

01:20:25.899 --> 01:20:26.921
But it's June

01:20:26.956 --> 01:20:28.783
Galgo, get the hell out

01:20:28.818 --> 01:20:30.607
Yes sir

01:20:32.078 --> 01:20:33.872
My hat

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:42.486
I'm curious

01:20:42.521 --> 01:20:43.020
What?

01:20:43.055 --> 01:20:45.091
Since when did suicide become your hobby?

01:20:45.126 --> 01:20:46.567
I got a will

01:20:46.602 --> 01:20:49.587
You know I'm probably the only friend you got

01:20:49.622 --> 01:20:50.825
I got a lot of friends

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.975
People jump on the tables

01:20:55.541 --> 01:20:56.950
I missed you Christmas

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:58.998
I miss you too you demented bastard

01:20:59.033 --> 01:21:00.548
You could've loved that demented

01:21:02.511 --> 01:21:04.519
Solid structure

01:21:05.354 --> 01:21:07.504
That is taking us from 1 place to another

01:21:07.539 --> 01:21:08.581
Through unbelievable speeds

01:21:09.016 --> 01:21:09.926
Think about it

01:21:09.961 --> 01:21:13.932
If God...if God... if he would've liked us you know flying

01:21:13.967 --> 01:21:17.238
He would've give us feathers

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:18.849
Do you have feathers?

01:21:18.884 --> 01:21:19.900
Do you have feathers?

01:21:19.935 --> 01:21:23.026
- I don't have feathers
- It's gonna be a long ass flight fella

01:21:23.061 --> 01:21:24.255
It's going to be

01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:26.752
It's going to be a long flight but don't worry

01:21:26.787 --> 01:21:30.093
I'm here, because I can

01:21:31.434 --> 01:21:32.068
Yeah

01:21:32.103 --> 01:21:34.597
Thought you should know Barney, you're walking into a shitstorm

01:21:34.632 --> 01:21:38.460
NSA ran a signal and frequencies checks on your team's phone

01:21:38.495 --> 01:21:40.903
This bastard's not even trying to hide them

01:21:40.938 --> 01:21:41.711
Where has he taken them?

01:21:41.746 --> 01:21:43.150
They're in

01:21:43.185 --> 01:21:44.940
Another honeymoon hotspot

01:21:45.315 --> 01:21:46.131
Who is that?

01:21:46.166 --> 01:21:47.541
Lee Christmas

01:21:47.576 --> 01:21:49.512
Not far off Christmas

01:21:49.547 --> 01:21:52.326
Stonebanks's compound is where he trained is goons

01:21:52.361 --> 01:21:54.581
It's very heavily fortified

01:21:54.616 --> 01:21:56.018
What's up with the local army?

01:21:56.053 --> 01:21:58.184
I don't understand a word this guy is saying

01:21:58.219 --> 01:21:59.522
Local army status

01:22:00.157 --> 01:22:01.559
Small, corrupt

01:22:02.294 --> 01:22:05.489
Stonebanks got all the brass in his pocket

01:22:05.524 --> 01:22:09.005
Been running his operations through this shithole of a country for years

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.310
Wants some advice?

01:22:10.345 --> 01:22:13.570
- What's the advice?
- What goddamn language is that?

01:22:13.605 --> 01:22:16.340
Look who's talking

01:22:16.375 --> 01:22:17.951
What's the advice Drummer?

01:22:17.986 --> 01:22:19.527
Forget about what you're thinking

01:22:19.562 --> 01:22:20.861
Remember our deal

01:22:20.896 --> 01:22:22.123
We need him alive

01:22:22.158 --> 01:22:25.175
So he could sit in his courtroom and beat us over the technicality

01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:27.583
Those are orders Barney

01:22:28.929 --> 01:22:30.614
- You broke the phone
- I got another 1

01:22:33.746 --> 01:22:35.191
Think we'll make it back from this 1?

01:22:35.226 --> 01:22:36.937
You didn't have to come along

01:22:36.972 --> 01:22:38.838
Sure I did

01:22:40.856 --> 01:22:42.439
Morons need friends

01:22:49.013 --> 01:22:49.892
Gentlemen

01:22:49.927 --> 01:22:51.125
Change of plans

01:23:08.386 --> 01:23:08.515
This is it?

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:10.627
This is your evac team?

01:23:10.838 --> 01:23:11.822
Short notice

01:23:11.857 --> 01:23:13.019
Yeah

01:23:13.054 --> 01:23:14.001
Very short

01:23:14.036 --> 01:23:15.940
Where is your team?

01:23:15.975 --> 01:23:17.523
Major Drummer?

01:23:17.558 --> 01:23:19.637
No team, this one's off the book

01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:22.136
I'm not even here

01:23:23.792 --> 01:23:24.664
Nobody's here

01:23:26.574 --> 01:23:28.113
I thought Church was asshole

01:23:43.643 --> 01:23:46.595
I mean, if you're hysterically strong

01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:48.108
You don't even have to go to the gym

01:23:48.143 --> 01:23:51.030
You are just strong. You just got it

01:23:51.065 --> 01:23:54.888
This is similar to reality

01:23:54.923 --> 01:23:58.015
In the 19th century

01:23:58.050 --> 01:23:59.770
You know what I mean

01:23:59.805 --> 01:24:02.408
Well, this is interesting place

01:24:02.443 --> 01:24:02.544
Give me a migraine

01:24:03.479 --> 01:24:04.517
I hear that

01:24:04.852 --> 01:24:05.576
Don't you think?

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:07.503
Look at the bright side

01:24:07.938 --> 01:24:10.368
You run out of bullet

01:24:10.403 --> 01:24:11.672
Roger that

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:14.033
Tall 1 doesn't like me

01:24:14.068 --> 01:24:15.128
He doesn't like anybody

01:24:15.163 --> 01:24:16.496
- What you say?
- He likes you

01:24:28.046 --> 01:24:28.999
The hell is that?

01:24:29.671 --> 01:24:30.864
What?

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:32.407
The computer strap to your wrist

01:24:32.442 --> 01:24:33.996
Nothing

01:24:33.997 --> 01:24:36.491
The same thing you were busting that kid's balls about

01:24:36.526 --> 01:24:38.047
Nah, I had it for 1

01:24:49.521 --> 01:24:51.138
Why'd your team let you go?

01:24:55.164 --> 01:24:56.192
Why is it matter now?

01:24:56.227 --> 01:24:57.739
I want to know who I'm working with

01:25:02.271 --> 01:25:03.523
They are not around anymore

01:25:07.905 --> 01:25:08.560
So

01:25:10.037 --> 01:25:11.161
This um,

01:25:15.137 --> 01:25:16.058
So why they let you go?

01:25:16.093 --> 01:25:17.954
They didn't

01:25:28.406 --> 01:25:30.263
Benghazi

01:25:30.298 --> 01:25:34.185
I wasn't in the army anymore. We were

01:25:35.046 --> 01:25:37.646
retreating hostage something like uh

01:25:38.908 --> 01:25:40.986
like what we are doing here

01:25:43.343 --> 01:25:46.301
It was a beautiful day

01:25:47.328 --> 01:25:49.660
No problems

01:25:49.695 --> 01:25:52.579
And then it all went bad

01:25:54.367 --> 01:25:56.085
We got hit, got off

01:25:57.213 --> 01:25:59.501
Waited for support, no 1 came

01:26:06.492 --> 01:26:06.538
Everybody died

01:26:11.231 --> 01:26:12.565
Except me

01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:14.927
Ready to go?

01:26:15.946 --> 01:26:17.844
This forces us

01:26:22.067 --> 01:26:23.860
To see

01:26:23.895 --> 01:26:25.583
Yeah

01:26:28.611 --> 01:26:29.838
Thank you

01:27:08.852 --> 01:27:10.150
So what do you think?

01:27:11.496 --> 01:27:13.914
I think we should get this over with

01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:45.005
4 signals

01:27:45.916 --> 01:27:47.155
They are ready

01:27:47.190 --> 01:27:48.767
This is way too wrong

01:27:49.786 --> 01:27:50.946
It's not I don't like it

01:27:50.981 --> 01:27:52.944
You know he got eyes on us now

01:27:52.979 --> 01:27:56.532
- May I suggest something?
- No. No, later.

01:27:56.567 --> 01:27:57.840
That's what I thought

01:27:57.875 --> 01:27:59.278
That's fine

01:29:05.144 --> 01:29:05.551
Go

01:29:38.098 --> 01:29:38.809
Break it

01:29:47.312 --> 01:29:48.255
The hell

01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:52.256
Hello Barney

01:29:55.006 --> 01:29:56.133
I knew you couldn't stay away

01:29:57.017 --> 01:29:59.051
But I'm relieved someone will take up the kids

01:30:00.006 --> 01:30:03.063
You got them in there, now try gettting them out

01:30:04.292 --> 01:30:05.508
But unfortuantely for you

01:30:05.943 --> 01:30:09.133
The entire complex has been wired with C-4

01:30:10.263 --> 01:30:15.173
It takes a regular Joe about 90 seconds to get out of there.
You got, how about 45 seconds?

01:30:29.239 --> 01:30:30.962
He's turned this whole place into a bomb

01:30:33.847 --> 01:30:34.965
Maybe not

01:30:40.441 --> 01:30:42.309
9% battery? You didn't charge it?

01:30:42.344 --> 01:30:44.706
Excuse me but what are you doing?

01:30:44.741 --> 01:30:47.233
Try to run some code, should be able to jam the signal

01:30:47.268 --> 01:30:48.208
Why didn't you think of that?

01:30:48.243 --> 01:30:49.655
Well I use it to check the weather

01:30:49.690 --> 01:30:51.308
Will you just shut up and let him do his thing?

01:30:51.343 --> 01:30:52.419
You sure you're gonna do this Thorn?

01:30:52.454 --> 01:30:53.785
I can do it, I can do it.

01:30:59.452 --> 01:31:01.562
Come on, man.

01:31:01.697 --> 01:31:02.748
Come on, man.

01:31:02.783 --> 01:31:04.050
Come on, come on.

01:31:04.085 --> 01:31:06.257
Come on

01:31:06.292 --> 01:31:07.664
Come on

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.578
You're good, come on Thorn.

01:31:13.898 --> 01:31:15.057
Focus, focus.

01:31:15.092 --> 01:31:17.168
Got it

01:31:17.203 --> 01:31:19.767
Good job, my boy

01:31:24.795 --> 01:31:26.972
We lost override. The signal is jammed.

01:31:27.007 --> 01:31:28.686
Send them in

01:31:31.412 --> 01:31:34.369
Barney the battery's at 8%. When this thing died, we lose override.

01:31:34.404 --> 01:31:36.409
That gives us about 25 minutes tops

01:31:39.848 --> 01:31:42.092
Don't pop the bottle yet, we still got troubles

01:31:42.127 --> 01:31:44.061
Big trouble

01:31:58.058 --> 01:31:59.034
Lucky again bro

01:31:59.069 --> 01:32:02.506
Try to enjoy the view because shortly the building that you're currently standing in

01:32:03.041 --> 01:32:05.544
Will be surrounded by the ---stan army

01:32:07.492 --> 01:32:10.159
- How did you shitheads managed to get captured?
- Shut up!

01:32:17.337 --> 01:32:18.504
Step back

01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:23.736
That's about to be an accident.
And we're trapped in here.

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:27.046
This is exactly what he knew would happen

01:32:27.081 --> 01:32:29.655
Us, tearing at each other

01:32:30.646 --> 01:32:32.269
This stops now

01:32:33.889 --> 01:32:34.552
We can do this

01:32:35.777 --> 01:32:38.415
But only if we do this together

01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:41.045
If we work as a team

01:32:42.795 --> 01:32:44.764
We just may get out of this alive

01:32:47.091 --> 01:32:50.534
And you, I want to make it work

01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:52.865
That simple

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.756
You got any weapons?

01:32:54.791 --> 01:32:57.820
Here's the plan. We're gonna break up into small groups

01:32:57.855 --> 01:32:59.439
And go out to the ground floor

01:32:59.474 --> 01:32:59.520
Get ready

01:33:00.355 --> 01:33:01.265
Come on

01:33:24.582 --> 01:33:26.342
You Stay with me

01:33:26.377 --> 01:33:27.599
Thorn you stay with me. I want you to take Galgo.

01:33:27.634 --> 01:33:28.235
Yeah I don't want to

01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:30.270
What, what? Shhh

01:33:47.875 --> 01:33:49.029
Don't stop

01:33:49.064 --> 01:33:50.540
1 there, 1 there

01:34:03.487 --> 01:34:04.572
There's too many

01:34:04.607 --> 01:34:06.529
They're on our flank. Bring it to them

01:34:24.398 --> 01:34:26.045
That's enough, light them up

01:34:32.937 --> 01:34:33.785
Incoming

01:34:43.837 --> 01:34:46.128
Up the shaft Thorn. You gotta protect the signal jammer

01:35:04.829 --> 01:35:05.990
I thought you could fight

01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.566
Jesus God, you're ok?

01:35:57.601 --> 01:35:58.894
Do not worry I love this

01:35:58.929 --> 01:36:00.521
Good keep moving

01:36:49.095 --> 01:36:50.601
Relax

01:36:50.636 --> 01:36:53.021
I told you you'd give yourself a stroke

01:36:54.354 --> 01:36:56.072
We got a tank problem pal

01:36:56.107 --> 01:36:57.404
Do something about it

01:36:57.439 --> 01:36:58.321
I'm on it

01:37:01.166 --> 01:37:01.519
Trench, on your right

01:37:08.012 --> 01:37:08.589
That's gotta hurt

01:37:13.332 --> 01:37:14.980
Drummer's in the house

01:37:39.696 --> 01:37:40.351
Let's go

01:37:42.254 --> 01:37:44.223
Time to pick up the tempo boys

01:37:54.250 --> 01:37:55.401
Look out for the chopper

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:56.635
Not good

01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:58.433
Hold on

01:38:20.268 --> 01:38:21.920
This does not happen

01:38:21.955 --> 01:38:23.012
You want to do something?

01:38:51.174 --> 01:38:53.102
Beware

01:38:54.216 --> 01:38:55.194
Oh shit

01:39:05.777 --> 01:39:06.576
Hi there

01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:16.463
Closer

01:39:16.498 --> 01:39:18.824
Closer

01:39:22.477 --> 01:39:23.849
Yang, hit something

01:39:30.073 --> 01:39:31.059
Next

01:39:38.134 --> 01:39:39.399
Your name is Luna right?

01:39:39.434 --> 01:39:41.865
Luna means moon

01:39:43.061 --> 01:39:45.588
Hypnotic, mysterious, magical, like yourself

01:39:50.056 --> 01:39:52.451
Would you like to hold my gun?

01:39:54.074 --> 01:39:55.410
Goodbye sweet

01:40:01.087 --> 01:40:02.561
There is

01:40:19.650 --> 01:40:20.700
Come on, drive this thing

01:40:29.571 --> 01:40:31.111
See you assholes

01:40:34.012 --> 01:40:34.570
Yeah

01:40:34.605 --> 01:40:36.158
Damn that's cool

01:40:47.064 --> 01:40:48.825
It was all under control

01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:49.989
That's what it looked like

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:15.810
This the happiest moment of my life

01:42:33.545 --> 01:42:34.839
Jingling jingling

01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:40.418
You finished here?

01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:05.542
Men

01:43:07.916 --> 01:43:09.882
- You're no gonna believe this
- Oh, god

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:11.675
I've been thinking of you the whole time

01:43:11.710 --> 01:43:13.148
Can we just go

01:43:17.435 --> 01:43:18.497
Come on

01:43:19.939 --> 01:43:21.416
Hold up

01:43:24.442 --> 01:43:25.773
Where did you learn how to fly?

01:43:40.544 --> 01:43:42.156
Warning, we got reinforcements

01:43:52.990 --> 01:43:53.822
Shit

01:44:00.812 --> 01:44:03.514
Drummer, there's another wave coming

01:44:03.749 --> 01:44:05.502
The only way out is up

01:44:05.937 --> 01:44:06.548
On my way

01:44:07.383 --> 01:44:08.542
Evac in 5

01:44:09.177 --> 01:44:10.418
Got it

01:44:10.453 --> 01:44:11.929
Everybody get to the roof now
