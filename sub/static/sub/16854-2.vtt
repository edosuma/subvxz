WEBVTT

00:00.185 --> 00:02.585
Previously,
on "Childrens Hospital"...

00:02.620 --> 00:04.288
Dori, that was a little intimate.

00:04.322 --> 00:06.256
Oh, I don't think
I'll get pregnant from that.

00:06.291 --> 00:07.724
Let me guess.
You're pregnant.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.259
Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:09.327 --> 00:12.696
We are going to oversee
the opening of a clinic

00:12.730 --> 00:15.199
on a U.S. army base in Japan.

00:15.233 --> 00:16.533
- No!
- What?

00:16.600 --> 00:17.600
That is so complicated.

00:17.635 --> 00:19.671
Do you remember
Detective Chance Briggs,

00:19.778 --> 00:21.782
Owen's former partner
on the police force?

00:21.806 --> 00:23.540
Uh, I think so.

00:23.574 --> 00:26.176
What, he has brown hair
and a mustache?

00:26.211 --> 00:28.169
Anybody up
for a mustache contest?

00:28.204 --> 00:29.263
I win.

00:29.298 --> 00:30.488
- What about him?
- I don't know.

00:30.523 --> 00:32.343
Just something to keep in mind,
I guess.

00:34.454 --> 00:39.061
5.02 - Triangles

00:39.290 --> 00:40.757
Attention!

00:40.791 --> 00:42.893
Staff, that is all.

00:42.927 --> 00:43.961
Hey, Dori.

00:43.962 --> 00:44.895
Where you headed?

00:44.929 --> 00:46.616
Oh, I'm taking Willy
into the city.

00:46.690 --> 00:48.101
He's never had soup noodles.

00:48.232 --> 00:50.901
Oh. Well, Osaka
is a very dangerous town.

00:50.935 --> 00:52.202
I could be your escort.

00:52.237 --> 00:54.771
Who knows? We might even
enjoy each other's company.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.236
I've been told I make
a pretty great escort,

00:57.306 --> 00:59.139
like the Ford Motor Corporation.

00:59.174 --> 01:01.745
The Escort
was discontinued in 2003.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.914
Right. Got me good.

01:03.948 --> 01:05.883
You are so smart.

01:05.917 --> 01:06.950
Blake!

01:06.985 --> 01:08.785
Um, I'm taking our son
into the city.

01:08.819 --> 01:09.853
Did you get my e-mail?

01:09.888 --> 01:11.288
Uh, I don't know.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.590
I don't really open e-mails
from people like you.

01:13.657 --> 01:14.691
I mean, I'm a doctor.

01:14.759 --> 01:15.558
You get it.

01:15.593 --> 01:17.194
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17.228 --> 01:18.762
Love those bangs.

01:18.796 --> 01:19.429
Oh.

01:19.497 --> 01:20.430
Hey, listen.

01:20.464 --> 01:21.731
Um, here's 30,000 yen.

01:21.766 --> 01:24.467
I mean, buy him a taco
or something, okay.

01:24.502 --> 01:27.504
Want to come into the city
with us, Mr. Dad?

01:27.538 --> 01:29.946
Well, I would,
because we're technically family,

01:30.015 --> 01:32.374
but, I mean, you get it.

01:32.802 --> 01:34.304
Come on, honey.

01:37.782 --> 01:39.749
Hmm.

01:39.784 --> 01:40.717
Na.

01:44.588 --> 01:45.755
I have to pee.

01:45.790 --> 01:47.958
Sounds like someone
has to go pee.

01:47.992 --> 01:48.691
Let's go.

01:48.726 --> 01:50.394
I can go by myself.

01:50.461 --> 01:51.594
Okay, honey.

01:51.629 --> 01:52.662
Just be careful.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.898
And remember to tap
your pee-pee!

01:54.933 --> 01:56.599
I pre-tapped it!

01:56.667 --> 01:57.801
Okay.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.242 --> 02:36.440
But, officer...

02:39.538 --> 02:41.788
I'm sorry. I don't understand
what you're saying.

02:42.847 --> 02:45.715
Maybe I can be
of some assistance here.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.784
My name
is Detective Chuck Engel.

02:47.818 --> 02:48.818
My partner and I are here

02:48.853 --> 02:51.062
as part of an international cop
exchange program.

02:51.097 --> 02:52.933
Partner?
I don't see any partner.

02:52.968 --> 02:55.925
That's because you
weren't looking in this direction.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.799
If we're gonna catch
those mean man,

02:57.834 --> 03:00.263
we need to know
exactly what you saw.

03:20.385 --> 03:23.320
My word.
That's urine. Pure.

03:23.354 --> 03:24.621
Son, those men...

03:24.688 --> 03:26.911
are they the murderers
or are you just peeing in your pants

03:26.984 --> 03:28.572
because you pee
in your pants?

03:28.607 --> 03:30.927
I've had a lot
of sports drinks today,

03:30.961 --> 03:33.863
but in this case, murderers.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.633
Police Chief Kaiju.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.368
Chief Kaiju.
It's Briggs.

03:38.403 --> 03:39.202
I know who did it.

03:39.270 --> 03:40.404
It's Gojira and Mosura.

03:40.438 --> 03:43.173
The kid took one look at 'em
and peed in his pants.

03:43.207 --> 03:45.574
Uh, did my name come up?

03:45.609 --> 03:46.945
No. Why?

03:46.980 --> 03:49.478
I just want to make sure
I wasn't under suspicion in any way.

03:49.546 --> 03:52.649
No. Like, why would you
even ask that?

03:52.684 --> 03:53.382
Forget I mentioned it.

03:53.416 --> 03:56.853
Hey, Briggs someone's at the door.
Will you hold on a sec?

04:09.466 --> 04:11.601
Briggs, I'm back.
Wrong number.

04:11.673 --> 04:13.647
Chief, while I was
on hold with you,

04:13.719 --> 04:15.657
Gojira and Mosura
got a phone call

04:15.767 --> 04:17.038
and then ran off.

04:17.072 --> 04:19.475
- Kinda weird, huh?
- Yes and no.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.110
What about you, Briggs?

04:21.144 --> 04:22.344
Where do you live?

04:22.379 --> 04:24.547
What's your exact address?

04:24.581 --> 04:27.864
I live at 465
Lick My Butthole Lane.

04:30.788 --> 04:33.156
Get your stuff!
We're getting out of here now!

04:33.190 --> 04:34.919
Wait! Damn it, Briggs!
What the hell is going on?

04:35.125 --> 04:36.399
I need to disappear.

04:36.434 --> 04:37.601
Watch your back, partner.

04:37.636 --> 04:39.161
Wait, did you say,
"Watch your black partner?"

04:39.196 --> 04:40.763
How am I suppose
to respond to that?

04:40.798 --> 04:42.966
No, I said,
"Watch your back, partner,"

04:43.000 --> 04:44.968
although I can definitely see
how it sounded like "black" to you.

04:45.002 --> 04:46.803
No, that's a funny
misunderstanding.

04:46.837 --> 04:48.771
Especially considering
you do have a black partner.

04:48.806 --> 04:50.306
Right. Absolutely.

04:50.340 --> 04:52.642
I don't think I can
operate without you, Briggs.

04:52.676 --> 04:53.342
Try, Engel.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.678
- No, I'm serious...
- I said try, Engel.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.714
Come on.

05:01.184 --> 05:03.185
Dori! You're back!

05:03.220 --> 05:04.721
I was worried sick about you!

05:04.788 --> 05:05.822
Don't worry.

05:05.890 --> 05:08.124
She's safe in my capable
yet calloused hands.

05:08.158 --> 05:10.444
Detective Chance Briggs.

05:10.479 --> 05:12.631
You plus-sized
woman's panty set!

05:12.666 --> 05:14.357
What's my old partner
doing here?

05:14.392 --> 05:15.598
Put 'er there.

05:15.633 --> 05:17.867
You guys were cops together?

05:17.935 --> 05:20.036
Yeah, and we went
to the same college.

05:20.103 --> 05:21.895
Who would have thought
a couple of Oberlin grads

05:21.965 --> 05:23.409
would end up carrying badges?

05:23.444 --> 05:24.707
So what are you doing here,
old boy?

05:24.742 --> 05:27.076
Well, let's just say
that I need a place to hide.

05:27.110 --> 05:28.845
"That I need a place
to hide."

05:28.879 --> 05:30.713
But surely
you can't be serious.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.015
I am serious...

05:32.049 --> 05:34.183
And don't ever question
my seriousness.

05:34.217 --> 05:35.718
Please, Dr. Maestro.

05:35.786 --> 05:37.954
If they find Willy,
they'll kill him, too.

05:37.988 --> 05:39.856
What do you say,
old friend?

05:39.890 --> 05:41.991
Help us out?

05:42.026 --> 05:43.826
Well, you're gonna need a disguise.

05:43.861 --> 05:45.635
Come with me.

05:47.698 --> 05:49.131
Congratulations,
Private Briggs!

05:49.166 --> 05:51.300
You're in the United States
army now.

05:51.334 --> 05:52.969
All right.

05:53.003 --> 05:54.078
Where's Briggs?

05:54.153 --> 05:58.797
'Cause there's no such place
as 465 Lick My Butthole Lane.

05:58.976 --> 06:01.915
Lick My Butthole Lane
ends at 426

06:01.950 --> 06:04.948
then skips right to the 700s
after Central Boulevard.

06:04.982 --> 06:05.882
It's a sham address.

06:05.916 --> 06:08.117
Look, I told you.
He didn't tell me anything.

06:08.151 --> 06:09.218
Watch your back.

06:09.252 --> 06:11.153
Did you say,
"Watch your black"?

06:11.188 --> 06:12.521
What's that supposed to mean?

06:12.590 --> 06:13.856
I said, "back."

06:13.891 --> 06:15.660
I've just got kind
of a wonky accent,

06:15.738 --> 06:18.349
so it sounded like I said "black",
but I said "back."

06:18.384 --> 06:19.228
I gotcha. I gotcha.

06:26.704 --> 06:27.980
Hi.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.238
Hi.

06:29.272 --> 06:31.107
I brought you
a piece of pie

06:31.174 --> 06:34.877
and some Doritos
and two slices of watermelon.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.755
Triangle-shaped foods.
My favorite.

06:38.215 --> 06:41.618
Thank you, Detective Briggs,
for all that you've done for us.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.753
Folks usually aren't so nice
to me and Willy.

06:43.787 --> 06:46.022
Here's an oldie
for all you lovers out there.

06:46.056 --> 06:48.224
Oh, I love this song!

06:48.258 --> 06:51.227
I watched Owen lose his virginity
to this song at Oberlin.

06:51.261 --> 06:52.495
Cool.

06:52.530 --> 06:54.030
Can you just keep it down
for a second?

06:54.064 --> 06:55.832
Yeah. Sorry. Sorry.

06:55.866 --> 06:58.935
Would you to care
to dance, my lady?

06:58.969 --> 07:00.837
I would love to.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.692
Can you feel it?

07:06.844 --> 07:08.578
My erection?

07:12.650 --> 07:14.984
I haven't had a man
in so long.

07:15.019 --> 07:17.586
Take me! Take all of me!

07:26.329 --> 07:27.263
Chance Briggs!

07:27.330 --> 07:28.965
Yeah! Chance!

07:28.999 --> 07:29.899
Shh!

07:29.933 --> 07:31.868
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

07:31.902 --> 07:33.002
Chance Briggs!

07:33.037 --> 07:33.970
Attention staff,

07:34.004 --> 07:35.071
Chance Briggs.

07:35.105 --> 07:36.105
That is all.

07:38.608 --> 07:39.709
Moshi moshi.

07:39.743 --> 07:40.910
Yes, I have some information

07:40.978 --> 07:43.743
on the whereabouts
of Detective Chance Briggs

07:43.854 --> 07:46.694
that you may be
very interested in.

07:49.319 --> 07:51.788
Mommy, I heard
weird noises last night.

07:51.822 --> 07:52.722
Is everything okay?

07:52.756 --> 07:54.924
Your mom and I
were making love, son.

07:54.958 --> 07:56.893
What does "making love"
mean?

07:56.927 --> 08:00.329
Umm, it's...
it's kind of hard to explain, honey.

08:00.363 --> 08:02.899
Our bodies fit together
like puzzle pieces.

08:02.933 --> 08:05.802
You know when mommy
tries to put a Pringles can

08:05.836 --> 08:06.903
down the disposal?

08:06.937 --> 08:08.571
I don't understand.

08:08.605 --> 08:11.040
It's like when a man
puts his penis

08:11.150 --> 08:14.109
inside a woman's vagina
a bunch of times in a row.

08:14.144 --> 08:15.712
You did that
to my mommy?

08:15.746 --> 08:16.913
Damn right I did.

08:16.947 --> 08:18.647
Wow. I regret asking.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.085
- Owen!
- No, no, no!

08:22.119 --> 08:24.053
What the heck was that
all about?

08:24.088 --> 08:26.989
The killers found Briggs!
You have to help him, please!

08:27.024 --> 08:29.125
Oh, you're trembling.
You look so cold.

08:29.159 --> 08:30.193
I'm so scared!

08:30.227 --> 08:31.194
Oh, thank you so much.

08:31.228 --> 08:32.260
Okay.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.263
This feels so right,
doesn't it?

08:34.297 --> 08:35.798
What?

08:35.866 --> 08:39.235
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

08:43.774 --> 08:45.041
Hey, guys.

08:45.075 --> 08:46.075
Guys, wait up!

08:46.110 --> 08:48.607
Look, Mosura,
I just talked to Chief Kaiju,

08:48.642 --> 08:50.713
and he needs to talk to you
right away.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.681
So I'll watch the prisoner.

08:54.043 --> 08:57.286
He's at 465
Lick My Butthole Lane.

08:57.354 --> 08:59.188
Hai!

08:59.223 --> 09:00.923
Whew.

09:00.991 --> 09:03.492
Got ourselves out
of another jam, huh, partner?

09:03.560 --> 09:04.193
Yeah.

09:07.408 --> 09:09.197
Oh, wait.
No, this is still going.

09:11.568 --> 09:12.778
No, you're not!

09:16.006 --> 09:17.240
Don't worry.

09:17.274 --> 09:20.542
You did really great,
for a black guy.

09:20.577 --> 09:22.611
What'd you say?

09:22.679 --> 09:24.213
Forget about it.
I just heard you wrong.

09:25.249 --> 09:27.683
Mommy! Help me!

09:27.717 --> 09:28.717
Oh, right.

09:28.752 --> 09:30.499
My son, this whole thing.

09:30.534 --> 09:31.737
I'm gonna kill him!

09:31.772 --> 09:33.109
No, you're not!

09:33.944 --> 09:35.107
Let him go.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.616
Why should I?

09:36.651 --> 09:38.862
Because he's
the only family I've got.

09:50.864 --> 09:53.373
Well, I guess
I should be going now.

09:57.881 --> 09:59.615
You're not going anywhere,
Briggs.

09:59.683 --> 10:00.983
You're in the army now.

10:01.018 --> 10:02.551
We're shipping out to Kandahar.

10:02.619 --> 10:04.086
But I was just hiding!

10:04.121 --> 10:07.223
We're all hiding
from something, private.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.767
♪ Get me out of this place ♪

10:18.836 --> 10:20.703
