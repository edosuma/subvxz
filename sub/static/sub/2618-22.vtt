WEBVTT

00:38.477 --> 00:41.410
Help me!

00:46.611 --> 00:48.110
Can anyone hear me?!

00:53.978 --> 00:55.477
<i>( over speaker ):
Man overboard!</i>

01:00.611 --> 01:05.078
Help! Get me out!

01:02.777 --> 01:04.878
Sir! Are you all right?!

01:04.944 --> 01:06.711
Can you swim?

01:06.777 --> 01:08.310
Just hang in there!

01:08.377 --> 01:09.777
We'll get you some help!

01:13.377 --> 01:17.544
Get me out!

01:17.611 --> 01:20.244
Mike, is that you?

01:20.310 --> 01:22.077
That's my husband, Mike!

01:22.143 --> 01:23.444
Man overboard!

01:23.511 --> 01:26.043
Someone, please,
do something! Help him!

01:41.244 --> 01:42.711
MIKE:
They're everywhere!

01:44.143 --> 01:45.611
Get me out of here!

01:45.677 --> 01:47.010
You swim, Mike!

01:47.077 --> 01:49.377
You kick your feet
right now! Swim!

01:51.344 --> 01:53.344
Sharks! Sharks!

01:53.410 --> 01:55.043
Somebody do something!

01:58.711 --> 02:01.777
Someone help!
I've got a man overboard
on the port side.

02:01.844 --> 02:04.244
Let me get a rescue
craft in the water now.

02:05.844 --> 02:06.944
Help!

02:07.010 --> 02:08.377
I got sharks in the water!

02:08.443 --> 02:09.511
Where's that craft?!

02:21.077 --> 02:22.644
Talk to me, baby!

02:27.244 --> 02:28.978
Oh, God.

02:29.077 --> 02:33.177
Come on! Let's get
that boat in the water!

03:19.744 --> 03:21.611
MAN:
I expected to see the FBI.

03:21.677 --> 03:24.210
TRIPP:
Someone dies within three miles
of Miami shoreline,

03:24.277 --> 03:25.744
you're stuck with us.

03:25.811 --> 03:26.978
So who alerted you?

03:27.043 --> 03:29.544
No one.
I heard the screams.

03:29.611 --> 03:31.177
So there were witnesses.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.177
Well, no one that
actually saw him go over.

03:33.244 --> 03:34.511
There weren't a lot of people

03:34.577 --> 03:35.811
on deck at that time--
it was 6:00 a.m.

03:35.878 --> 03:38.611
So, Captain, you fired
three shots in the water

03:38.677 --> 03:41.110
in an attempt to save
the victim who is...

03:41.177 --> 03:42.911
Mike Harris, is that right?

03:42.978 --> 03:44.544
That's right.

03:44.611 --> 03:47.410
We couldn't get a boat in
the water in time to save him.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.310
I had to do whatever I could
to try to scare them off.

03:50.377 --> 03:52.043
I've never seen
sharks in this close.

03:52.110 --> 03:53.410
I hit one of them,

03:53.477 --> 03:55.477
but... it wasn't enough.

03:55.544 --> 03:58.811
So you wouldn't consider this
to be a normal rescue procedure.

03:58.878 --> 04:01.711
It wasn't a normal situation.
I had to make a judgment call.

04:01.777 --> 04:03.577
Do you know where
he went over?

04:03.644 --> 04:07.210
Could have been any one
of our five decks.

04:07.277 --> 04:09.777
Frank, I've got blood
right here.

04:12.511 --> 04:14.611
And there's a shoe print.

04:14.677 --> 04:16.177
TRIPP:
Scuff marks, too.

04:16.244 --> 04:18.777
Signs of a struggle.

04:18.844 --> 04:20.444
TRIPP:
Railing's pretty high.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.244
Looks like Mike didn't
dive in there by choice.

04:23.310 --> 04:26.177
So if he didn't dive,
he was pushed.

05:26.807 --> 05:28.640
Dive team's doing
a routine check

05:28.707 --> 05:30.440
on the underside
of the boat.

05:30.507 --> 05:32.674
Gonna need more than that, Eric.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.707
You want to find a body?
Mm-hmm.

05:34.774 --> 05:37.841
And, Eric, there are blacktip
sharks out there-- be careful.

05:37.907 --> 05:40.308
You know me, I love fish.

05:46.451 --> 05:48.750
MAN:
Mike Harris was traveling
with Gwen Creighton

05:48.817 --> 05:49.917
and her daughter, Mandy.

05:49.984 --> 05:51.284
What was their relationship?

05:51.351 --> 05:52.750
CAPTAIN:
Newlyweds, actually.

05:52.817 --> 05:54.017
They met
onboard the ship.

05:54.084 --> 05:55.683
I performed the
ceremony myself.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.217
That's quite
a brief honeymoon.

05:57.284 --> 05:58.583
Brief
relationship.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.351
They met the first
day of the cruise.

06:00.418 --> 06:02.251
So they only knew
each other a week.

06:02.317 --> 06:04.617
Oh, it happens all
the time on these cruises.

06:04.683 --> 06:05.984
They're like
floating singles bars.

06:06.051 --> 06:07.650
Okay, I need to speak
to the Creightons.

06:07.717 --> 06:09.151
Where are you holding
the passengers?

06:09.217 --> 06:11.184
We're not-- the passengers
disembarked when we arrived.

06:11.251 --> 06:12.750
You let them go?

06:12.817 --> 06:14.151
This is a cruise ship,
Lieutenant.

06:14.217 --> 06:15.750
Most of these people
were on vacation.

06:15.817 --> 06:17.217
Not anymore.

06:26.617 --> 06:28.717
Hello.
Is there anyone in here?

07:01.784 --> 07:05.384
Did you run that glass
I got from Mike's stateroom?

07:05.451 --> 07:07.817
You are scary good.

07:07.884 --> 07:09.650
Someone slipped
Mike a Mickey.

07:09.717 --> 07:12.251
Diazepam.

07:12.317 --> 07:14.850
Good old-fashioned
sleeping pills.
So, I got a lead.

07:14.917 --> 07:17.451
Me, too.
Well, we'll save
the best for last.

07:17.518 --> 07:19.351
You go first.

07:19.418 --> 07:22.418
Well, for starters,
found out from the wife,

07:22.484 --> 07:24.850
70 grand was taken
from Mike's safe-- motive.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.184
And Mike was drugged.

07:26.251 --> 07:28.683
It would make it very easy
to throw him overboard.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.217
Beat that.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.151
Shoe print that Horatio
found by the railing.

07:32.217 --> 07:34.117
It's a Pelgado.

07:34.184 --> 07:36.484
Mm-hmm, that's a unique shoe.
Who wears those?

07:36.550 --> 07:38.484
Every male officer
on board the ship,

07:38.550 --> 07:39.917
they're standard issue.

07:39.984 --> 07:41.650
So that narrows it down
to, like, what, 40 officers?

07:41.717 --> 07:42.650
Oh, less than that.

07:42.717 --> 07:44.650
It's a size 14.

07:44.717 --> 07:50.184
Hmm.

07:50.251 --> 07:52.151
I was on the Sun Deck
early this morning,

07:52.217 --> 07:53.717
and I ran into this guy.

07:53.784 --> 07:55.117
CAINE:
His name is Mike Harris.

07:55.184 --> 07:56.984
MAN:
That's right. He was drunk.

07:57.051 --> 07:58.484
Belligerent.

07:58.550 --> 07:59.583
He could barely
stand up.

07:59.650 --> 08:00.884
I tried
to help him out,

08:00.950 --> 08:03.184
but he wanted
nothing to do with me.

08:08.251 --> 08:10.518
Sir, why don't you
take it back...

08:10.583 --> 08:11.850
Leave me alone.

08:11.917 --> 08:14.351
Just take it easy.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.484
It took some... convincing.

08:18.550 --> 08:19.917
How far did you take it?

08:19.984 --> 08:22.184
Enough to get him to get him
to go back to his room.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.418
Yes, but he didn't make it
back to his room, did he?

08:24.484 --> 08:28.817
Why would I throw the man
overboard, Lieutenant?

08:28.884 --> 08:31.583
$70,000 may have been a factor.

08:31.650 --> 08:34.317
What $70,000?

08:34.384 --> 08:37.217
$70,000 was missing
from his safe.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.317
Look, I didn't
touch Mike Harris,

08:39.384 --> 08:41.582
or his safe--
check the database.

08:41.650 --> 08:43.549
Keycard access is all recorded.

08:43.616 --> 08:44.917
I'm going to.

08:59.017 --> 09:01.884
DUQUESNE:
I heard Horatio's got
that deck officer squirming.

09:01.950 --> 09:03.184
You think he's our guy?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.683
I'm about to find out.

09:05.650 --> 09:07.483
I'm going through
the ship's keycard log.

09:07.550 --> 09:08.684
It tracks card usage.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.117
So every time someone

09:10.184 --> 09:11.318
swipes their keycard
it gets recorded.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.717
Exactly-- if you, uh...

09:12.784 --> 09:15.450
if you open a door, you pay
a bill at a restaurant...

09:15.517 --> 09:16.784
Open a safe?

09:16.850 --> 09:18.483
Right.

09:18.550 --> 09:21.850
This is Mike's stateroom.

09:21.917 --> 09:24.351
Let's see.

09:29.384 --> 09:34.418
So, the last time the safe
was opened was at 5:00 a.m.

09:42.351 --> 09:44.550
It's an hour before
Mike went overboard.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.917
Who opened it, size 14?

09:50.418 --> 09:51.917
No, his wife.

09:51.984 --> 09:55.850
Of three days.

09:58.650 --> 10:02.418
Somebody must've taken my card.

10:02.483 --> 10:05.418
Well, is it missing?

10:13.117 --> 10:16.017
Maybe whoever took it
put it back.

10:16.084 --> 10:18.017
Why would I kill Mike
for 70 grand

10:18.084 --> 10:20.117
when he was worth
more than 21 million?

10:20.184 --> 10:22.583
You've been married
to Mike for three days

10:22.650 --> 10:25.051
and you know his
exact net worth.

10:25.117 --> 10:28.717
The point is,
it doesn't make sense.

10:28.784 --> 10:32.784
Maybe you took the 70 grand
to throw us off.

10:32.850 --> 10:35.784
Then you could collect
the big life insurance policy

10:35.850 --> 10:37.917
and we'd be looking
for some petty thief.

10:37.984 --> 10:39.418
Like you said,
we've only been

10:39.483 --> 10:41.084
married three days.

10:41.151 --> 10:43.450
Mike didn't have time to contact
his lawyers about me yet.

10:43.517 --> 10:46.184
Where were you last night,
Miss Creighton?

10:46.251 --> 10:48.217
Having a drink at the Mango Bar.

10:48.284 --> 10:49.550
All night?
Yes.

10:49.617 --> 10:51.351
Ask the wait staff.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.784
I was there killing time
while Mike was at the show.

10:52.850 --> 10:54.017
Mike was
at the show?

10:54.084 --> 10:57.384
Why...
Why weren't you with him?

10:57.450 --> 10:59.750
I mean,
you're newlyweds.

10:59.817 --> 11:01.717
He asked me not to go.

11:01.784 --> 11:03.117
Mike wanted to bond with Mandy.

11:03.184 --> 11:03.418
Mandy, your daughter, Mandy?

11:05.384 --> 11:05.817
Yeah, she's waiting
for me over there.

11:10.184 --> 11:13.951
Sit tight,
Miss Creighton.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.418
Mandy, your mom said
that you went

11:23.483 --> 11:26.450
to the show with Mike
last night, is that right?

11:26.517 --> 11:28.717
We were supposed to,
but he never showed.

11:28.784 --> 11:31.151
Didn't you wonder what
happened to him?

11:31.217 --> 11:33.483
I just thought
he got sidetracked.

11:33.550 --> 11:36.017
WOLFE:
That just seems
strange to me.

11:36.084 --> 11:38.817
You weren't worried?
Mm-hmm.

11:38.884 --> 11:42.017
Now, though, I wish
I went looking for him.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.483
Did you find the body?

11:58.550 --> 12:01.151
DELKO:
Yeah, of a dead shark.

12:01.217 --> 12:03.984
It's got a small caliber round
in the front of its head.

12:04.051 --> 12:06.817
From the captain's
service pistol.

12:06.884 --> 12:09.450
If this is the shark
that attacked our victim,

12:09.517 --> 12:10.817
it's going to tell
us plenty more.

12:10.884 --> 12:12.483
I'm going to need some help
getting it out.

12:12.550 --> 12:15.284
Ho, ho, hold on there, cowboy.

12:15.351 --> 12:16.550
I'll get somebody
down here.

12:16.617 --> 12:17.850
Yeah.

12:30.717 --> 12:31.884
CAINE:
Marisol.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.617
Hi.

12:33.684 --> 12:35.184
Are you okay?

12:35.251 --> 12:37.617
I-I don't know.

12:37.684 --> 12:40.051
What do you mean?

12:40.117 --> 12:43.151
I was brought in today
for questioning.

12:43.217 --> 12:45.850
Questioned by who, sweetheart?

12:45.917 --> 12:47.483
Um, it was some
federal agent.

12:47.550 --> 12:49.051
I guess the FBI?

12:49.117 --> 12:50.583
Okay. What did he ask you?

12:50.650 --> 12:52.917
He... he asked me about
you and about Eric.

12:52.984 --> 12:55.483
He wanted to know everything
I knew about the lab.

12:55.550 --> 12:57.418
I told him I don't
know anything.

12:57.483 --> 12:58.517
He just... he wouldn't stop.

12:58.583 --> 13:01.418
It scared me.
I understand.

13:01.483 --> 13:02.450
What was his name?

13:02.517 --> 13:04.517
Oh, wait, he
gave me a card.

13:08.717 --> 13:10.351
Special Agent Wynn.

13:10.418 --> 13:11.817
MARISOL:
You know him?

13:11.884 --> 13:14.151
No, I don't.

13:14.217 --> 13:17.184
Hey, are you in trouble?

13:17.251 --> 13:18.650
No, but he is.

13:27.984 --> 13:30.717
TRIPP:
That looks like a guppy.

13:30.784 --> 13:32.917
What took you so long?

13:32.984 --> 13:36.384
<i>DELKO ( laughs ):
Little shortage
of manpower, Tripp.</i>

13:40.151 --> 13:42.251
Something stuck in its teeth.

13:42.318 --> 13:44.917
It's not a piece of fish.

13:48.483 --> 13:50.951
It's a human belly button.

13:51.017 --> 13:53.750
That means
maybe there's more inside.

13:53.817 --> 13:56.583
All right, we'll get this shark
back to the lab

13:56.650 --> 13:59.051
and have them start a necropsy.

13:59.117 --> 14:01.984
Do me a favor,
crank it up a little bit.

14:02.051 --> 14:03.617
<i>( metallic clanking )</i>

14:03.684 --> 14:05.817
DELKO:
Whoa, whoa, all right.

14:05.884 --> 14:09.450
TRIPP:
Looks like trash
from the cruise ship.

14:15.217 --> 14:16.884
Yeah.

14:16.951 --> 14:18.884
Maybe the reason the sharks
were in so close.

14:18.951 --> 14:20.450
Illegal dumping.

14:20.517 --> 14:22.583
Sharks can smell that
from a mile away.

14:22.650 --> 14:23.917
That's right.

14:23.984 --> 14:25.750
Captain had to know about this.

14:25.817 --> 14:27.917
I'd bet on it.

14:33.184 --> 14:36.151
If any trash came from my ship,
it must've been an accident.

14:36.217 --> 14:38.617
You've had a number
of those recently.

14:38.684 --> 14:40.051
Are you going to accuse me

14:40.117 --> 14:41.784
of throwing
that man overboard, too?

14:41.850 --> 14:42.850
Did you?

14:42.917 --> 14:45.084
I don't have
time for this.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.450
I have a ship sitting
in the port of Miami

14:47.517 --> 14:50.951
like a lame duck and
that is bad for business.

14:51.017 --> 14:53.017
So is negligence.

14:53.084 --> 14:54.817
I have nothing to hide,
Lieutenant.

14:54.884 --> 14:56.483
Okay, well,
you won't mind

14:56.550 --> 14:58.617
if I look into the history
of your ship then.

14:58.684 --> 14:59.850
Please, be my guest.

15:20.951 --> 15:23.917
CAINE:
Agent Wynn.

15:23.984 --> 15:27.284
Lieutenant Caine.

15:27.351 --> 15:29.951
Oh, I hope you don't
mind me dropping in.

15:30.017 --> 15:31.351
It doesn't work
to call ahead.

15:31.418 --> 15:33.117
What do you want?

15:33.184 --> 15:35.117
Well, actually, I need
your help, Lieutenant.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.418
Something doesn't
smell right to me.

15:38.483 --> 15:40.418
The woman central to
the investigation

15:40.483 --> 15:41.750
against Officer Delko

15:41.817 --> 15:44.717
becomes your girlfriend,
thus protecting her

15:44.784 --> 15:46.984
from further scrutiny
and, suddenly,

15:47.051 --> 15:50.117
her own drug charges
just disappear.

15:50.184 --> 15:51.784
Agent Wynn, you should've
done better research.

15:51.850 --> 15:54.084
There were no charges
filed on the Delkos.

15:54.151 --> 15:57.151
You know, I did you
a favor, Lieutenant.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.650
I could've subpoenaed Marisol.

15:59.717 --> 16:02.717
Stuck her in front of
a white light and a grand jury.

16:02.784 --> 16:05.184
I was just trying to see if
there was something there.

16:05.251 --> 16:07.117
So you wasted your time.

16:07.184 --> 16:11.517
An investigation into a dirty
lab is never a waste of time.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.984
Agent Wynn,
I don't know who you are

16:14.051 --> 16:15.817
or who you work for,

16:15.884 --> 16:18.483
but if you ever
contact Marisol again,

16:18.550 --> 16:20.850
it'll be the last thing
you ever do.

16:32.017 --> 16:33.617
How's our gunshot victim?

16:34.750 --> 16:37.617
I'm never eating seafood again.

16:39.450 --> 16:42.384
These guys
really are garbage disposals.

16:44.583 --> 16:46.117
Chicken bones, vegetables.

16:46.184 --> 16:48.117
Mmm, that looks delicious.

16:53.517 --> 16:57.284
Doubt the cruise line
serves this.

16:57.351 --> 17:00.117
Mike Harris's leg.

17:00.184 --> 17:03.884
DUQUESNE:
My God, those bite marks
look like daggers.

17:03.951 --> 17:05.884
Hold on.

17:05.951 --> 17:08.884
One of these was caused
by a dagger.

17:08.951 --> 17:11.617
That'll work.

17:11.684 --> 17:13.684
WOODS:
This laceration is larger.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.417
Isolated.

17:15.483 --> 17:18.084
No tears
in the associated tissue.

17:18.151 --> 17:20.351
Doesn't match
the other shark bites.

17:20.417 --> 17:22.817
Hmm.

17:22.884 --> 17:25.817
This victim has sharp force
trauma injury.

17:25.884 --> 17:27.884
So he was stabbed.

17:37.717 --> 17:40.884
That explains why Horatio found
blood on the railing.

17:40.951 --> 17:42.318
How much blood did he find?

17:42.384 --> 17:45.384
Couple of drops,
a smear.

17:45.483 --> 17:46.884
Why? What are you thinking?

17:46.951 --> 17:48.884
Well, I mean,
I won't know

17:48.951 --> 17:50.550
until I see the
rest of the body,

17:50.617 --> 17:52.450
but based on the
location of this wound,

17:52.517 --> 17:57.084
I'd be surprised if Mike
was stabbed just once.

17:57.151 --> 17:59.384
If that's true, there should be
a lot more blood.

18:07.784 --> 18:11.418
So our victim was stabbed,
but there's no mess?

18:11.483 --> 18:12.784
Yeah, I know.

18:12.850 --> 18:16.384
2,000 people aboard,
and no one sees a thing.

18:16.450 --> 18:18.217
I think our killer
cleaned up.

18:18.284 --> 18:20.217
Well, lucky for us,

18:20.284 --> 18:22.617
other people's idea
of what clean is

18:22.684 --> 18:24.984
is different than ours.

18:25.051 --> 18:27.984
I heard the field
agent hit your sister
pretty hard, man.

18:28.051 --> 18:29.483
Who?

18:29.550 --> 18:32.017
What are you talking about?

18:32.084 --> 18:35.217
The fed that
interviewed Marisol.

18:35.284 --> 18:37.450
I thought you knew about that.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.217
No, Wolfe, I don't know--
why don't you tell me?

18:40.284 --> 18:42.117
Cooper said that Marisol
came by the lab,

18:42.184 --> 18:43.418
that she was very upset,

18:43.483 --> 18:45.151
and that she wanted
to talk to Horatio.

18:45.217 --> 18:46.850
Why is the FBI
talking to my sister?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.151
I think it's about you.

18:48.217 --> 18:50.051
What the hell about?

18:50.117 --> 18:52.684
About the... the marijuana.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.684
Look, I don't know, man,

18:54.750 --> 18:56.951
they want to talk about
Horatio, or something.

18:57.017 --> 18:58.750
It's wrong, okay,
she's a civilian.

18:58.817 --> 19:00.184
Yeah, I think it was
pretty messed up...

19:00.251 --> 19:01.817
It's more than
than messed up, Wolfe.

19:01.884 --> 19:05.750
All right, Eric, relax,
I'm just the messenger, man.

19:05.817 --> 19:07.284
I-I know.

19:07.351 --> 19:08.951
All right, I know that.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.850
I don't want to talk about it
anymore.

19:12.917 --> 19:14.384
All right, we're
going to drop it.

19:14.450 --> 19:16.318
I'm sorry.

19:16.384 --> 19:18.784
<i>( sniffs ):
Smell that?</i>

19:20.917 --> 19:22.884
It's paint.

19:29.550 --> 19:32.917
DELKO:
These moldings are glossy.

19:33.951 --> 19:37.583
Yeah, they're still tacky.

19:40.384 --> 19:41.984
Hey, it looks like

19:42.051 --> 19:45.084
there's gravitational spatter
under this paint.

20:03.483 --> 20:05.583
It's blood.

20:07.418 --> 20:09.084
This could be where
Mike was stabbed,

20:09.151 --> 20:10.583
and someone tried
to cover it up.

20:10.650 --> 20:12.717
Yeah, the infirmary
is right here.

20:14.151 --> 20:15.750
Maybe he was running in
to see a doctor.

20:22.583 --> 20:23.850
Maybe not.

20:25.251 --> 20:26.850
Look at the directionality
of the spatter.

20:28.884 --> 20:31.217
He was coming out.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.184
We had an 12-year-old boy
come in yesterday

20:45.251 --> 20:46.750
with a cut on his foot.

20:46.817 --> 20:48.418
DELKO:
Was he bleeding
when he left?

20:48.483 --> 20:50.051
Of course not. No.

20:50.117 --> 20:51.717
Well, somebody was,

20:51.784 --> 20:54.984
and the blood was covered
with a fresh coat of paint.

20:57.217 --> 20:59.117
Delko.

20:59.184 --> 21:02.418
I found where
the blood came from.

21:02.483 --> 21:04.583
Hang on.

21:07.217 --> 21:09.151
This doesn't have anything to do
with Mike Harris.

21:09.217 --> 21:11.784
DELKO:
Who does it have
to do with?

21:11.850 --> 21:13.917
Rebecca Farraday.

21:13.984 --> 21:16.650
What was this patient's
prognosis, Doctor?

21:16.717 --> 21:19.951
I should clear this
with the captain first.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.217
Okay, well, you don't
use restraints

21:21.284 --> 21:22.784
for someone with seasickness.

21:23.817 --> 21:25.384
And there's blood here.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.450
So what happened?

21:27.517 --> 21:30.483
Rebecca Farraday was brought in
with an eye infection

21:30.550 --> 21:32.517
and acute respiratory distress.

21:32.583 --> 21:35.318
She was delirious
and resistant to treatment.

21:35.384 --> 21:38.051
Lay still, Miss Farraday.

21:38.117 --> 21:41.151
DOCTOR:
Please, take it easy.

21:42.684 --> 21:45.483
I restrained her
so my staff wouldn't get hurt.

21:48.817 --> 21:52.117
Did you suspected
avian influenza?

21:52.184 --> 21:54.984
Her symptoms were consistent
with the bird flu, yes.

21:55.051 --> 21:56.850
Where is she now?

21:56.917 --> 21:58.384
She got out
of the restraints.

21:58.450 --> 21:59.684
We can't find her.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.017
Rebecca, no!

22:02.450 --> 22:04.850
Did you fly a blood sample
to the CDC?

22:04.917 --> 22:07.850
Uh, no, I was, um,
asked to wait.

22:07.917 --> 22:10.684
That we were less than 24 hours
away from shore.

22:10.750 --> 22:13.217
And I suppose that you were
asked to wait by Captain Taylor,

22:13.284 --> 22:14.884
those are his orders.

22:14.951 --> 22:17.650
Yes.

22:17.717 --> 22:20.217
So what the hell
kind of ship are you
running, Captain?

22:20.284 --> 22:22.951
Excuse me...
who are you?

22:23.017 --> 22:24.418
The man that just found
those bloody restraints

22:24.483 --> 22:25.617
in your infirmary.

22:25.684 --> 22:27.984
Now, holding
Rebecca Farraday

22:28.051 --> 22:30.051
against her will,
that's kidnapping.

22:30.117 --> 22:32.450
It was for her own safety.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.884
And if she dies
as a result of her injuries,

22:34.951 --> 22:36.684
that constitutes murder.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.483
Dies? From a small cut?

22:38.550 --> 22:40.184
Or the bird flu.
Bird flu?

22:40.251 --> 22:43.151
Yeah, so you're going
to deny that, too?

22:43.217 --> 22:45.151
This is getting ridiculous.

22:45.217 --> 22:47.017
So you are lying.

22:47.084 --> 22:51.583
We have charts and a statement
from the doctor.

22:53.217 --> 22:55.217
I didn't want to cause
any panic.

22:55.284 --> 22:57.717
So you put the city at risk
instead of your boat?

22:57.784 --> 23:00.583
Okay, you need
to step away from me.

23:00.650 --> 23:02.117
Now!
I don't need to do anything.

23:02.184 --> 23:03.583
You're the suspect in a
murder investigation.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.318
Are you going
to arrest me, Officer?

23:06.384 --> 23:07.550
Not yet.

23:07.617 --> 23:08.984
All right, then.

23:09.051 --> 23:10.850
I have a ship to prepare
for a cruise.

23:10.917 --> 23:13.650
I have 20 years at sea, and I
have never missed a launch.

23:13.717 --> 23:15.483
First time for everything.

23:15.550 --> 23:17.051
Good day.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.483
Horatio.
The blood
on the restraints, Frank?

23:24.550 --> 23:26.217
CDC said it was
too degraded.

23:26.284 --> 23:27.617
Still don't know if
it's bird flu.

23:27.684 --> 23:29.384
We have to find
Rebecca Farraday.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.217
You think she's
still on the ship?

23:31.284 --> 23:33.550
I don't know, but that ship
is not leaving port
till we know for sure.

23:33.617 --> 23:35.284
What if she got off
with everyone else?

23:35.351 --> 23:37.650
If she did, she did not
get off alive, Frank.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.017
Could have two murders.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.450
Two and counting.

23:55.704 --> 23:58.170
Eric, I spoke to Jessop.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.337
Jessop? Why?

23:59.404 --> 24:00.671
Said he was concerned

24:00.737 --> 24:02.637
about a conversation
you had with a suspect.

24:02.704 --> 24:03.971
What, is everyone
a mole now?

24:04.038 --> 24:06.004
Eric, somebody's watching us.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.437
The feds?

24:07.504 --> 24:09.704
I don't know, but
every move we make

24:09.771 --> 24:11.837
on and off the job
is being scrutinized.

24:11.904 --> 24:13.937
Why?

24:14.004 --> 24:16.871
<i>( camera shutter clicking )</i>

24:16.937 --> 24:19.370
I think someone is planning
to destroy this lab,

24:19.437 --> 24:21.504
and they're about
to make their move.

24:21.570 --> 24:23.337
I don't want to help them.

24:37.837 --> 24:39.370
Did you page me?

24:39.437 --> 24:42.404
Got a lead
on the man overboard case.

24:42.470 --> 24:44.404
The results off the
new wife's keypad?

24:44.470 --> 24:45.537
That is correct.

24:45.604 --> 24:46.737
What took you so long?

24:46.804 --> 24:49.871
Someone's not returning
her pages.

24:49.937 --> 24:53.104
That is because someone
has been below deck.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.004
Got a lot of smudges,

24:58.071 --> 24:59.804
but decent partial.

24:59.871 --> 25:02.071
Is it Gwen Creighton's?

25:02.138 --> 25:05.237
Nope. Ran it through all
the databases, nothing popped.

25:05.303 --> 25:09.038
What about the cruise
line's employee manifest?

25:09.104 --> 25:11.871
Good call.

25:15.971 --> 25:17.570
KAYLE:
What kind of
entertainer?

25:17.637 --> 25:19.704
Every cruise has one.
I read the manifest.

25:19.771 --> 25:21.437
He's a magician.

25:21.504 --> 25:23.237
Our murder victim was
worth a fortune.

25:23.303 --> 25:26.138
Looks like Mr. Judd
made it disappear.

25:28.071 --> 25:30.270
DUQUESNE:
So, you're a magician?

25:30.337 --> 25:31.737
Yeah, and no stage.

25:31.804 --> 25:33.470
My magic's up
close and personal.

25:33.537 --> 25:35.737
So that's how you got
Gwen Creighton's ID card?

25:35.804 --> 25:37.771
The wife of the guy
who went overboard?

25:37.837 --> 25:38.771
Yeah.

25:38.837 --> 25:40.337
Every cruise,

25:40.404 --> 25:41.771
there's some woman who
flashes you the eyes,

25:41.837 --> 25:44.237
and you just know she'll
be fun to work with.

25:44.303 --> 25:46.203
Gwen was here,
a little lit up,

25:46.270 --> 25:47.404
friendly.

25:47.470 --> 25:48.804
And you took advantage of that.

25:48.871 --> 25:49.637
I entertained her.

25:49.704 --> 25:52.237
Nothing here, right?

25:52.303 --> 25:54.170
Nope.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.971
Is this your room key?

25:59.038 --> 26:01.504
<i>( laughing ):
Oh, my God.</i>

26:03.004 --> 26:08.303
You can keep searching me,
if you want.

26:08.370 --> 26:10.203
She wanted me to go back
to her room with her.

26:10.270 --> 26:11.904
Instead, you went back alone.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.637
Why would I do that?

26:13.704 --> 26:15.404
To take the 70 grand
that she had in her safe.

26:15.470 --> 26:16.570
That's absurd.

26:16.637 --> 26:18.704
Look, you can search
me if you want.

26:18.771 --> 26:20.971
I'd rather check your kit.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.370
Go ahead.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.104
Hmm.

26:46.170 --> 26:47.637
Abracadabra.

26:47.704 --> 26:49.337
So I lifted the card.

26:49.404 --> 26:52.104
She kept bragging about all
the money she had in the safe.

26:52.170 --> 26:54.203
Said her family was
out for the night.

26:54.270 --> 26:56.237
And you thought
you'd up your salary.

27:14.071 --> 27:15.871
Hey.

27:15.937 --> 27:17.237
Hey, hey, who...?

27:18.537 --> 27:20.170
That's the last
I saw of him.

27:20.237 --> 27:21.804
I swear I
didn't kill him.

27:21.871 --> 27:24.671
I went right back to
her and slipped the
card into her purse.

27:24.737 --> 27:26.971
You know, I'm afraid
it just doesn't mean very much

27:27.038 --> 27:29.370
coming from a guy who
deceives people for a living.

27:31.237 --> 27:33.671
VALERA:
Hey, I heard you guys
found the 70 grand.

27:33.737 --> 27:35.138
WOLFE:
Yeah, we did.

27:35.203 --> 27:36.937
So Trace said they
sent you the glass

27:37.004 --> 27:38.470
from Mike Harris's
room. What's up?

27:38.537 --> 27:40.537
Yeah, they said
there may have been biologicals

27:40.604 --> 27:41.837
in addition to the diazepam.

27:41.904 --> 27:44.071
And?
They were right.

27:44.138 --> 27:45.504
Found desiccated
cranial epithelials

27:45.570 --> 27:47.504
on the edge of the glass.

27:47.570 --> 27:48.804
Dandruff?

27:48.871 --> 27:50.104
And DNA matches one

27:50.170 --> 27:52.337
of the elimination samples
you got off the ship.

27:52.404 --> 27:53.971
Mandy Creighton.

27:54.038 --> 27:55.904
Do you really think
the victim's

27:55.971 --> 27:57.904
own stepdaughter drugged him?

28:07.337 --> 28:10.138
So I slipped a sleeping thing
in his drink.

28:10.203 --> 28:12.203
It's no big deal.

28:12.270 --> 28:13.904
He's dead now.

28:13.971 --> 28:16.270
It's a very big deal.

28:17.871 --> 28:19.904
Yeah, I know.

28:19.971 --> 28:23.038
Look, I know that this is gonna
sound lame, but I was

28:23.104 --> 28:25.170
really happy
for my mom.

28:25.237 --> 28:26.871
I-I don't want her
to be alone.

28:26.937 --> 28:28.937
Then why did
you drug Mike?
I just...

28:29.004 --> 28:30.737
I didn't want to spend
my last night

28:30.804 --> 28:31.904
on the ship with him.

28:31.971 --> 28:34.837
So you knocked him out?

28:34.904 --> 28:37.504
It was my only way
that I could spend time...

28:39.104 --> 28:41.138
...with other people.

28:41.203 --> 28:42.904
Who were you with, Mandy?

28:45.270 --> 28:47.537
I don't want him
to lose his job.

28:47.604 --> 28:50.771
I think you need to worry
about yourself right now.

28:50.837 --> 28:53.771
All right.

28:53.837 --> 28:57.971
I met Keith the very first day.

28:58.038 --> 29:00.871
Keith Murray. The first mate?

29:00.937 --> 29:02.437
Yeah.

29:11.237 --> 29:12.337
There you go.

29:12.404 --> 29:14.270
Thank you.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.871
My pleasure.

29:18.037 --> 29:20.604
Anything else
I could do for you?

29:23.737 --> 29:26.171
We said that-that we'd meet
on the deck

29:26.237 --> 29:27.904
to say good-bye
that morning.

29:27.970 --> 29:30.571
But then your new
stepdad caught you.

29:30.638 --> 29:32.504
Almost.

29:38.670 --> 29:40.471
Oh, my God,
that's my stepdad.

29:40.538 --> 29:41.904
How did he find us?

29:41.970 --> 29:43.137
It's okay.

29:43.204 --> 29:44.904
I'll take care of it.
Go up there.

29:47.737 --> 29:50.204
Was Keith the one who gave
you the diazepam, too?

29:50.271 --> 29:51.937
Yeah, but,

29:52.004 --> 29:54.904
they get to keep whatever
passengers leave behind.

29:54.970 --> 29:56.837
It's not illegal.

29:56.904 --> 29:59.070
But murder is, Mandy.

30:04.437 --> 30:06.070
So, I was... I
was with her.

30:06.137 --> 30:08.037
Why would I want to
kill her stepfather?

30:08.104 --> 30:10.337
'Cause he caught you
with his 16-year-old daughter.

30:12.471 --> 30:14.670
All right, all right.

30:14.737 --> 30:18.670
Uh... things did happen
a little different.

30:18.737 --> 30:21.471
I'm listening.

30:21.538 --> 30:24.737
Um, Mike was pissed.

30:24.803 --> 30:27.337
And I didn't want him
to see me with Mandy.

30:27.404 --> 30:28.770
So you roughed him up.

30:28.837 --> 30:30.970
No. I tried to get
him to calm down,

30:31.037 --> 30:32.837
and point him in
the right direction.

30:32.904 --> 30:35.437
Away from you and Mandy.

30:37.104 --> 30:39.037
Look, I...

30:39.104 --> 30:41.437
I left right after he did.

30:41.504 --> 30:44.504
She's 16 years old.

30:46.471 --> 30:48.571
Okay.

30:48.638 --> 30:50.337
Okay, that's all it took for me

30:50.404 --> 30:52.137
to come to my senses.

30:52.204 --> 30:54.137
It's against the rules
for us to get involved
with the guests.

30:54.204 --> 30:57.471
Keith, you don't seem concerned
about the rules.

30:58.504 --> 31:00.737
I don't want to lose my job.

31:00.803 --> 31:01.904
Hmm.

31:01.970 --> 31:03.937
You know, right now, my friend,

31:04.004 --> 31:06.604
that is the least
of your problems.

31:09.770 --> 31:12.504
All right. Thanks.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.037
Damn it.

31:14.104 --> 31:16.504
That's never a good sign.

31:17.837 --> 31:19.437
Rebecca Farraday's
a Miami native,

31:19.504 --> 31:20.837
so I contacted
her family,

31:20.904 --> 31:22.504
checked the local
hospitals, morgues.

31:22.571 --> 31:23.770
Nothing.

31:23.837 --> 31:25.471
What about the ship?

31:25.538 --> 31:27.271
Searched all
the common areas,

31:27.337 --> 31:29.271
ship's quarters,
you name it.

31:29.337 --> 31:31.070
That girl is not
on the boat.

31:31.137 --> 31:32.371
You checked everything?

31:32.437 --> 31:34.604
Unless I don't know the
meaning of the word.

31:34.670 --> 31:37.471
Checked the bilge,
septic tanks, garbage room?

31:37.538 --> 31:39.803
Why would she be
in the garbage?

31:39.870 --> 31:42.571
Cause that's the only place
you didn't check, Tripp.

31:42.638 --> 31:46.204
Come on,
come with me, let's go.
Jessop?

31:46.271 --> 31:47.538
Sir?

31:47.604 --> 31:49.304
I got a job for you.

31:49.371 --> 31:51.604
Yeah. Come on, Jessop, let's go.

31:54.504 --> 31:57.437
It's a nice move,
Frank. Okay.

32:31.070 --> 32:32.204
Delko?

32:32.271 --> 32:33.937
Yeah?

32:34.004 --> 32:36.337
Am I being punished?

32:36.404 --> 32:38.404
What do you mean?

32:39.803 --> 32:41.204
Because

32:41.271 --> 32:43.437
I said something
to Horatio about...

32:43.504 --> 32:45.670
your interrogation
techniques.

32:45.737 --> 32:48.571
You have a guilty conscience,
Jessop?

32:50.837 --> 32:53.471
Never asked me to work
anything else with you before.

32:53.538 --> 32:55.937
I didn't ask you to
work this, either.

32:56.004 --> 32:58.471
Tripp did.

32:58.538 --> 33:00.538
Still.

33:00.604 --> 33:03.538
This is feeling like
a bit of a message.

33:03.604 --> 33:05.837
Well, it is.

33:05.904 --> 33:07.337
Really?

33:07.404 --> 33:08.604
Yeah. Message is,
I have confidence

33:08.670 --> 33:09.970
that you can do the work.

33:10.037 --> 33:12.037
Got it.

33:32.803 --> 33:35.037
Delko.

33:48.104 --> 33:50.070
Can tell us two things.

33:50.137 --> 33:51.870
What's that?

33:51.937 --> 33:54.870
Well, I think you just
found Rebecca Farraday.

33:54.937 --> 33:57.504
And she was definitely murdered.

33:57.571 --> 33:58.904
How do you know that?

33:58.970 --> 34:00.437
Ligature marks
on her neck.

34:00.504 --> 34:02.271
She was strangled.

34:22.154 --> 34:24.353
So Eric, What was used to strangle Rebecca?

34:27.154 --> 34:29.054
Well, whatever it was,

34:29.121 --> 34:32.288
it left a deep impression
but no obvious pattern.

34:32.353 --> 34:34.887
So it wasn't a rope.
No.

34:34.954 --> 34:36.021
I'm thinking a belt.

34:36.087 --> 34:37.620
You see this indentation here?

34:37.687 --> 34:40.188
It looks like
it's from a small buckle.

34:45.954 --> 34:47.987
An adjustment clasp.

34:48.054 --> 34:50.054
Yeah, like on a strap
from a camera.

34:51.087 --> 34:53.887
No, binoculars.

35:00.554 --> 35:01.987
CAPTAIN:
Welcome aboard, sir,
enjoy your trip.

35:02.054 --> 35:03.254
Welcome, young lady.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.221
Please, thank
you for coming.

35:04.288 --> 35:05.620
Welcome aboard, sir.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.254
Thank you, ma'am, thank
you for coming aboard.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.453
Welcome. You're going to have
a great trip ahead of you.

35:09.520 --> 35:10.687
Thank you for coming.

35:10.754 --> 35:12.554
Welc...

35:12.620 --> 35:13.954
<i>Captain?
( sighs )</i>

35:14.021 --> 35:15.420
Lieutenant,
I'm working.

35:15.487 --> 35:17.787
You can contact the
ship's legal counsel.

35:17.854 --> 35:20.687
You are relieved of command,
effective immediately, Captain.

35:20.754 --> 35:22.787
What?

35:22.854 --> 35:25.420
DELKO:
A warrant got us into your
quarters, where we found these.

35:25.487 --> 35:26.787
Take a look at that.

35:26.854 --> 35:29.487
That strap was used
to strangle Rebecca Farraday.

35:32.754 --> 35:35.320
A lot of people have
the same binoculars,

35:35.387 --> 35:36.954
especially on a cruise.

35:37.021 --> 35:40.087
But not every one of them
has a DNA match to the victim.

35:41.121 --> 35:43.320
Officer.

35:46.487 --> 35:48.453
Miss Farraday was
running around bleeding.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.687
I tried to calm her down,
but she was delirious.

35:50.754 --> 35:52.221
She left the infirmary.

35:54.087 --> 35:55.921
She was endangering
the entire ship.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.154
So you neutralized the threat.

36:06.288 --> 36:08.453
You would have done exactly
the same thing, Lieutenant.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.320
She was infected
with avian flu.

36:10.387 --> 36:12.420
She was misdiagnosed.

36:12.487 --> 36:15.987
I had to make
a split-second decision.

36:16.054 --> 36:18.054
There were 2,000
lives to protect.

36:18.121 --> 36:20.654
Along with your reputation,
Captain.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.021
I have been a sea
captain for 20 years.

36:23.087 --> 36:25.420
Well, consider this
a career change.

36:25.487 --> 36:26.687
Take him.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.487
CAPTAIN:
Wait a minute.

36:38.687 --> 36:40.387
WOLFE:
Hey, Alexx, we got your page.

36:40.453 --> 36:41.887
What's the 911?

36:41.954 --> 36:44.121
Yeah. You and Calleigh
have a job to do.

36:44.188 --> 36:45.854
I work in a morgue.

36:45.921 --> 36:47.554
If I say something
smells...

36:50.987 --> 36:52.754
...it smells.

36:52.821 --> 36:55.453
Well, what is that?

36:55.520 --> 36:59.453
The rest of the contents
from the shark's stomach.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.121
And, guys, I need
this room back ASAP.

37:01.188 --> 37:02.821
Okay, we'll get it logged.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.687
Wait, hold on,
but we got Mike's leg.

37:05.754 --> 37:07.787
Anything that touches the body
is evidence.

37:07.854 --> 37:10.054
Ryan, honey,
procrastinating

37:10.121 --> 37:13.420
is only going to
prolong the agony.

37:20.021 --> 37:21.954
That looks like it was ripped
off something.

37:22.021 --> 37:24.821
I've seen it before.

37:28.954 --> 37:30.221
Mandy's dress.

37:35.821 --> 37:38.620
We just found out
who killed Mike.

37:43.453 --> 37:46.087
Mandy, would you
remove your cover-up, please?

37:48.087 --> 37:49.821
Why?

37:49.887 --> 37:52.720
Remove your cover-up.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.188
Mike scratched you
when you pushed him

38:11.254 --> 38:12.654
off the ledge, didn't he?

38:13.921 --> 38:15.320
No, the ship
has a rock wall.

38:15.387 --> 38:16.520
I was rock climbing.

38:16.587 --> 38:20.254
Mandy, it's too late.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.954
Why don't you just tell me
what happened?

38:29.520 --> 38:33.387
Mike ruined everything.

38:33.453 --> 38:35.787
Is it because
he caught you with Keith?

38:40.054 --> 38:44.121
Did you know that this is
my mom's fifth marriage?

38:44.188 --> 38:46.288
She said that
this trip

38:46.353 --> 38:50.353
was "for us."

38:50.420 --> 38:53.787
Our chance to finally
spend some time together.

38:54.887 --> 38:57.720
But she met Mike,
and she married him.

38:57.787 --> 39:01.021
Every three years,
it is a different guy

39:01.087 --> 39:04.821
wanting me to him "Dad."

39:04.887 --> 39:06.754
They don't care about me.

39:06.821 --> 39:09.254
They just want me
out of the way

39:09.320 --> 39:11.787
so that they can
sleep with my mom.

39:11.854 --> 39:14.021
You know, Mandy,
I think it's entirely possible

39:14.087 --> 39:16.320
that Mike did want
to get to know you.

39:16.387 --> 39:18.387
I mean, isn't that why
you had to drug him?

39:18.453 --> 39:20.654
Yeah, well, I didn't want
to get to know him.

39:21.754 --> 39:23.987
I thought we were going
to the show, Mandy.

39:28.188 --> 39:29.420
I hate you!

39:29.487 --> 39:30.487
I hate you!

39:30.554 --> 39:31.921
You ruined everything!

39:31.987 --> 39:34.154
<i>Mandy! ( grunts )</i>

39:35.154 --> 39:37.320
I hate you!

39:37.387 --> 39:39.487
Mandy, no!

39:57.520 --> 40:01.254
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

40:01.320 --> 40:03.620
I didn't plan on it.

40:03.687 --> 40:06.453
I know you didn't.

40:07.420 --> 40:14.221
I just didn't want
to lose my mom again.

40:14.288 --> 40:18.054
Why am I not enough for her?

40:18.121 --> 40:20.787
I don't know.

40:20.854 --> 40:23.687
I wish I did.

42:24.054 --> 42:25.554
There she is.

42:25.620 --> 42:27.021
Hi.

42:27.087 --> 42:28.554
Are you okay?

42:28.620 --> 42:31.154
I just want to be
clear about something.

42:31.221 --> 42:32.787
Go ahead.

42:32.854 --> 42:34.921
Last week, during
my treatment,

42:34.987 --> 42:37.487
you said you were
there for me.

42:37.554 --> 42:39.154
Right.

42:39.221 --> 42:41.320
What does that mean?

42:41.387 --> 42:45.320
I, um, I thought we agreed

42:45.387 --> 42:49.987
that we would do
whatever we wanted.

42:50.054 --> 42:53.987
Does that...

42:54.054 --> 42:56.520
Does that include marriage?

42:56.587 --> 42:58.154
It does.

43:00.188 --> 43:03.221
It does.
