Huh? Hey!

02:12.048 --> 02:14.092
There's something you don't see
in a toilet every day.

02:14.175 --> 02:17.428
Anybody lose their glasses?

02:17.512 --> 02:19.848
Last chance.
Whoo-hoo!

02:22.600 --> 02:25.728
The sum of the square roots of any
two sides of an isosceles triangle

02:25.812 --> 02:27.564
is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.983
-That's a right triangle, ya idiot!
-D'oh!

02:30.066 --> 02:33.653
Thank you so much for visiting
our plant, Dr. Kissinger.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.071
It was fun.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.823
We'll let you know
if your glasses turn up.

02:36.906 --> 02:40.535
Uh, yes. Well, I'm sure
I left them in the car.

02:40.618 --> 02:43.079
<i>(thinking) No one must know</i>
<i>I dropped them in the toilet.</i>

02:43.163 --> 02:47.041

02:47.125 --> 02:50.211
-Mm-Hmm. Mmm.
-Mm. Huh.

02:50.295 --> 02:53.548
-(scoffs, sighs)
-Mmm. Hmm.

02:53.631 --> 02:56.384
Sir, bad news from accounting.
The economy's hit us pretty hard.

02:56.467 --> 02:59.846
(scoffs) Tough times, huh?
I've lived through 12 recessions,

02:59.929 --> 03:02.432
eight panics and five years
of McKinleynomics.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.391
I'll survive this.

03:03.474 --> 03:06.186
Even so, sir, we could stand
to lay off a few employees.

03:06.269 --> 03:10.857
Oh! Very well. Lay off...
him, him, him, him-- Hmm.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.902
Better keep the egghead.
He just might come in handy.

03:13.985 --> 03:17.113
Dad, you shouldn't wear glasses
that weren't prescribed for you.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.867
Lisa, just because you're 10 feet tall
doesn't mean you can tell me what to do.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.494
-I'm Bart.
-Give me those.

03:23.578 --> 03:25.663
<i>And finally, Henry Kissinger</i>

<i>Now over to Kent Brockman</i>

03:31.294 --> 03:33.379
Scott, things aren't as happy
as they used to be

03:33.713 --> 03:35.590
down here at
the unemployment office.

03:35.673 --> 03:38.468
Joblessness is no longer
just for philosophy majors.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.387
Useful people are starting
to feel the pinch.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.641
I haven't been able
to find a job in six years.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.476
Huh. And what training
do you have?

03:46.559 --> 03:49.646
Five years of modern dance.
Six years of tap.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.773
BROCKMAN: The economic slump
began last spring,

03:51.856 --> 03:53.733
when the government
closed Fort Springfield,

03:53.816 --> 03:57.153
devastating the city's liquor
and prostitution industries.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.113
Now, at the risk
of being unpopular,

03:59.197 --> 04:00.865
this reporter places the blame

04:00.949 --> 04:02.659
for all this squarely on you,
the viewers.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.664
I propose that I use what's left
of the town treasury...

04:07.747 --> 04:10.291
to move to a more prosperous
town and run for mayor.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.460
And once elected,
I will send for the rest of you.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.588
Boo!

04:15.672 --> 04:19.008
-Excuse me, Mr. Mayor?
-The chair recognizes

04:19.092 --> 04:21.135
the little chick with the gleam
of hope in her eyes.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.889
This piggy bank contains $15
I saved from my allowance.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.518
It isn't much,
but I would like to help.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.646
Aw, just what I need
to tip the skycaps.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.856
I'll tell you what
made this town great!

04:33.940 --> 04:36.484
Good, old-fashioned gumption!

04:36.567 --> 04:39.487
There's nothing here
a little elbow grease won't fix!

04:39.570 --> 04:41.698
So let's roll up our sleeves...

04:41.781 --> 04:43.574
and--
(snoring)

04:43.658 --> 04:45.618
People! People!

04:45.702 --> 04:46.995
Let's be a little
more realistic.

04:47.078 --> 04:49.372
Now, I, uh, hesitate
to bring this up,

04:49.455 --> 04:51.666
but a number of cities
have rejuvenated their economies...

04:51.749 --> 04:53.960
with, uh, legalized gambling.

04:54.043 --> 04:55.878
(crowd murmuring)

04:55.962 --> 04:58.756
There is an added bonus.
Some of the revenue...

04:58.840 --> 05:01.175
can go to help our underfunded
public schools.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.971
(distant cricket sound)

05:05.054 --> 05:08.933
-Well, I like the part about the gambling.
-What do you think, Reverend?

05:09.017 --> 05:12.687
Once something has been approved by
the government, it's no longer immoral.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.647
-(cheering)
-By building a casino,

05:14.731 --> 05:17.734
I could tighten my stranglehold
on this dismal town!

05:17.817 --> 05:19.068
(cheering)

05:19.152 --> 05:21.279
-(belches)
-(cheering)

05:23.406 --> 05:25.325
Well, now.
Are there any objections?

05:25.408 --> 05:27.744
MAN: Oh, probably Marge
is gonna have some.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.746
(crowd murmuring Marge's name)

05:29.829 --> 05:32.248
Actually, I think it might
really help our economy.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.584
(murmuring excitedly)

05:34.667 --> 05:37.128
Very well then.
Instead of fleeing this town,

05:37.211 --> 05:40.381
I'll stay here and grow fat
off kickbacks and slush funds.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.799
(cheering)

05:41.883 --> 05:44.552
(shouting, cheering)

05:46.429 --> 05:48.556
This could be a whole new
beginning for Springfield.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.683
And you know
what the best part is?

05:50.767 --> 05:53.728
We've really done
something for the children.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.897
(man shouting)

06:07.867 --> 06:09.285
MAYOR QUIMBY:
We're thrilled you've decided

06:09.369 --> 06:11.037
to build your casino
on our waterfront.

06:11.120 --> 06:15.416
Oh, I 'll never forget my carefree boyhood
days on this old boardwalk.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.711

I mean, carry on.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.845

-(giggling)

06:27.929 --> 06:30.765
Me leg's gone gimpy!
Who'll provide for me little ones?

06:32.433 --> 06:33.643
(laughing)

06:35.770 --> 06:37.313
(laughing continues)

06:39.357 --> 06:40.900
(laughing continues)

06:43.528 --> 06:45.488
(laughing continues)

06:48.199 --> 06:49.742
(laughing continues)

06:51.869 --> 06:54.455
Oh! What was I laughing at now?

06:54.539 --> 06:56.165
(panting)

06:56.249 --> 06:58.376
Oh, yes.
That crippled Irishman.

06:58.459 --> 07:02.004
(laughing)

07:02.088 --> 07:04.549
Sir, the designers are here
with some prototypes for your casino.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.884
Gentlemen,
I give you Britannia!

07:06.968 --> 07:09.011
Gambling with all the glitz
and glamour of the British Isles.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.181
Best of all, the waitresses
and showgirls are all real Brits.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.767
Fresh from the streets of Sussex they are!
(clicks tongue)

07:14.851 --> 07:16.644
Freshen your drink,
governor?

07:16.727 --> 07:20.022
-Get out.
-Okay. All right. Wait--

07:20.106 --> 07:22.150
- Now-- Now, dig this, man--
- Get out!

07:22.233 --> 07:24.110
(chuckles) Wow. Oh, let me
just get my head together.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.112
Now!

07:26.195 --> 07:29.157
I'll need three ships
and 50 stout men.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.368
We'll sail round the Horn
and return with spices and silk,

07:32.452 --> 07:34.954
the likes of which
ye have never seen.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.999
-We're building a casino!
-Arr.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.001
Can you give me five minutes?

07:40.084 --> 07:43.504
(scoffs) Idiots. I'll design it myself!
I know what people like.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.966
It's got to have sex appeal
and a catchy name.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.556
Mom, we're having
a geography pageant at school,

07:53.639 --> 07:55.725
and I don't know
which state to go as.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.978
In honor of legalized gambling,
why not go as the state of Nevada?

07:59.061 --> 08:01.105
No. Nevada makes
my butt look big.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.399
Then how 'bout going
as Florida?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.527
You enjoy orange juice.
Old people like you.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.612
Dad, what do you think?

08:07.695 --> 08:11.032
Shh! I'm trying to teach
the baby to gamble.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.826
-Why?
-I got a job at Burns' casino.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.413
As you know, it's been my lifelong dream
to become a blackjack dealer.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.416
Your lifelong dream was to be
a contestant on <i>The Gong Show.</i>

08:20.500 --> 08:23.211
And you did it in 1977.
Remember?

08:23.294 --> 08:27.298
-♪♪ ("Oh! Susanna")
-(audience jeering)

08:28.633 --> 08:31.219
(gonging continues)

08:31.302 --> 08:35.473
We got more gongs than the break-dancing
robot that caught on fire.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.940
Hello. I'm retired
heavyweight boxer Gerry Cooney.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.025
Welcome to Mr. Burns' casino.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.236
If there's anything I can do to
make your visit more enjoyable,

08:48.319 --> 08:49.612
please, just let me know.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.863
Yeah, great. See ya!

08:50.947 --> 08:52.573
Uh, don't forget
to apply for...

08:52.657 --> 08:54.784
our V.I.P. platinum club
for special discounts on--

08:54.867 --> 08:57.370
-Hey! I said bug off!
-(whimpers)

09:00.498 --> 09:03.417
Uh, let's see.
Eighteen, 27, 35--

09:03.501 --> 09:07.004
Dealer bust!
Looks like you all win again.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.048
Yee-Haw! Homer,

09:09.131 --> 09:11.509
I want you to have
my lucky hat.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.511
I wore it the day
Kennedy was shot,

09:13.594 --> 09:16.013
and it always
brings me good luck.

09:16.097 --> 09:19.600
Why, thanks, Senator. Oop!
Looks like my shift is over.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.519
(all)
Uh-Oh!

09:21.602 --> 09:23.980
GRAMPA:
Come on, lucky seven!

09:24.063 --> 09:26.399
Papa needs
a new pair of spats.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.569
I want some of that
sweet, sweet do-re-mi!

09:29.652 --> 09:31.862
Fat City, here I come!

09:31.946 --> 09:33.990
Please throw the dice now.
Please. Now.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.325
Don't rush me!
I have arthritis.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.327
Will the gentleman
please roll the dice?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.329
All right, all right,
smart guy.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.499
(gasps) Oh, for crying out loud,
I dropped one.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.501
Oh! Now it's in my shoe!

09:45.585 --> 09:47.587
Ow! Ow! Ooh!

09:47.670 --> 09:49.630
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!

09:52.925 --> 09:56.095
A round of applause please
for Anastasia!

09:56.178 --> 09:58.222
She loves show business.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.641
So much nicer than the savagery
of the jungle, ja?

10:06.188 --> 10:08.065
-(honking)
-(low growl)

10:08.149 --> 10:10.651
Hey, tiger! Wake up!

10:10.735 --> 10:12.486
(growling)

10:12.570 --> 10:14.363
(roaring)

10:18.743 --> 10:20.536

-(screaming)

10:20.620 --> 10:21.996
(shouting in German)

10:26.917 --> 10:29.295
Whoo-hoo! Jackpot.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.505
Wait a minute!
Are you over 21?

10:31.589 --> 10:33.799
-Are you?
-I'm not authorized to answer that.

10:35.551 --> 10:38.429
(grunts)
By the way, your martinis suck!

10:38.512 --> 10:41.140
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?
Start your own casino,

10:41.223 --> 10:43.851
in your tree house and get all
your little friends to come?

10:43.934 --> 10:46.479
I'd like to see that!
(laughing)

10:46.562 --> 10:50.107
Hi. Yeah, welcome.
Have a lucky day! Mm-hmm.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.193
Well, he certainly showed me.

10:53.402 --> 10:56.322
MARGE:
Hi, Homie!

10:56.405 --> 10:59.450
Hey, Marge, after your big tantrum
against legalized gambling,

10:59.533 --> 11:02.161
I bet it feels pretty weird
to be in a casino.

11:02.244 --> 11:05.581
-I was for the casino!
-Strike three, Marge!

11:05.665 --> 11:08.959
I remember that meeting,
and I have a photographic memory.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.588
Legalized gambling
is a bad idea.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.049
You can build a casino
over my dead body.

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.805
-For you. It's the president.
-Y'ello?

11:20.888 --> 11:23.432
And then I said to the president--
get this--

11:23.516 --> 11:25.643
Marge? Marge?

11:26.769 --> 11:28.104
Hmm.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.233
Hmm, I wonder if they have
a lost and found.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.152
Oh, what the hey!

11:38.155 --> 11:40.282
-(coins clanking)
-♪♪ (fanfare)

11:40.366 --> 11:42.785
Mmm!

11:45.579 --> 11:46.831
Hmm.

-(distant chatter)

11:51.919 --> 11:55.047

Hey, how's it goin'? Hey!
Good to see you. Tell your friends.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.219
Lookin' lucky! Hey, what's happenin'?
Love the jacket.

12:00.302 --> 12:03.889
-(meows)
-Behold the box of mystery!

12:03.973 --> 12:07.601
The cat goes in-- (straining)
Right here--

12:07.685 --> 12:11.397
(screeching)

12:11.480 --> 12:13.566
(screeching continues)

12:13.649 --> 12:15.860
Twenty-one?

12:15.943 --> 12:18.404
Do that card-counting thing again.
Come on. Do it again.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.114
Definitely have
to leave the table.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.158
No! Please, please,
please, please, please.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.119
Gotta watch Wapner. Leave the table.
Yeah, leave the table.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.621
-No!
-(screaming)

12:27.705 --> 12:30.207

12:39.300 --> 12:42.720
Sir, you haven't slept since
the casino opened five days ago.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.930
I've discovered
the perfect business.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.933
People swarm in,
empty their pockets and scuttle off!

12:48.017 --> 12:50.019
Nothing can stop me now!

12:50.102 --> 12:52.521
Except microscopic germs.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.064
But we won't let that happen,
will we, Smithers?

12:54.148 --> 12:55.858
Uh-- No, sir.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.907

-(whimpering)

13:05.367 --> 13:07.828

That's good luck!

13:14.460 --> 13:15.878
ALL: Yay!

13:15.961 --> 13:18.839
-Snake eyes. Sorry.
-ALL: Boo!

13:18.923 --> 13:24.136
Garsh, it must be excitin'
to live in the casino.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.681
<i>-Ja.</i>
-You know, we are having a party tonight.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.978
-(roaring)
-(grunts)

13:33.062 --> 13:36.106
Whoa, Marge!
You gotta watch out.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.026
Your little boy Bart could have been
eaten by that pony!

13:39.109 --> 13:41.529
(gasps) Oh, my God!
Barney, thank you.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.614
I would never have
forgiven myself.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.908
Now, you stay put,
young lady.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.035
-(grunting)
-Oh!

13:48.118 --> 13:50.371
Man, that's classic
compulsive behavior.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.290
Wow! Free beer!

13:53.374 --> 13:55.209

Herpes! Trust me.

14:20.317 --> 14:24.029
-Anybody here have herpes? Huh? Huh?
-(person coughing)

14:24.113 --> 14:26.949
You people are the worst
audience I've ever seen.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.034
Well, you're the worst
comedian we've ever seen!

14:29.118 --> 14:32.663
Oh, great! Well, we'll just sit here
silently for the next 90 minutes.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.915
-Fine with us.
-(groans)

14:39.128 --> 14:42.965
They're all covered with filthy germs!
Aren't they, Smithers?

14:43.048 --> 14:44.174
Why, what do you mean, sir?

14:46.093 --> 14:49.221
-GERMS: Freemasons run the country!
-Ew!

14:49.305 --> 14:51.599
(Marge grunting)

14:54.143 --> 14:56.020
Marge, you waited for me!

14:56.103 --> 14:58.147
(grunts)

14:58.230 --> 15:00.232
-Okay, Marge. Let's go.
-I'll catch up to you.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.776
-Marge, I'm taking the car.
-I'll walk.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.779
-This late? Through the bad neighborhood?
-Yeah.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.324
-Marge--
-Go home! You're bad luck!

15:08.407 --> 15:12.453
Wait! I see
what's happening here.

15:12.536 --> 15:17.499
You're just mad because everyone in
this town loves gambling except for you!

15:17.583 --> 15:21.337
-Well, that's just sad.
-(grunting continues)

15:25.925 --> 15:28.928

15:29.011 --> 15:31.221
-Um--
-What?

15:31.305 --> 15:32.765
Excuse me, ma'am. Don't you
think you've gambled enough?

15:33.390 --> 15:34.308
No!

15:34.391 --> 15:38.854
Okay. We're required by law to ask every
75 hours. Get her another free drink.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.689
(meows)

15:40.773 --> 15:42.066
Do you get the feeling
this family is disintegrating?

15:42.149 --> 15:44.526
I mean, we haven't had
a meal with Mom all week.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.904
And she hasn't even started my costume
for the geography pageant.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.698
Pipe down, sister! I gotta book
a new act for tonight.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.826
Turns out that Liza Minnelli impersonator
was really Liza Minnelli.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.204
(shivers, grunts)

15:55.287 --> 15:58.332
-There's nothing to eat for breakfast!
-You gotta improvise, Lisa.

15:58.415 --> 16:02.795
Cloves, Tom Collins mix,
frozen pie crust-- Mmm!

16:02.878 --> 16:05.172
Maybe Mom just doesn't realize
we miss her.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.383
We could go down to
the casino and let her know.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.635
Aw, come on, Lisa.
There's no reason to--

16:11.929 --> 16:13.931
Let's go see Mom.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.100
(grunting)

16:16.183 --> 16:18.769
Marge, we need to talk.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.062
You're spending
too much time at the casino,

16:20.145 --> 16:21.563
and I think you may
have a problem.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.565
I won $60 last night.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.026
Whoo-hoo!
Problem solved!

16:26.110 --> 16:28.946
Smithers,
I've designed a new plane.

16:29.029 --> 16:32.157
I call it the Spruce Moose,
and it will carry 200 passengers...

16:32.241 --> 16:37.121
from New York's Idlewild Airport
to the Belgian Congo in 17 minutes!

16:37.204 --> 16:39.957
-That's quite a nice model, sir.
-Model?

16:40.040 --> 16:43.627
-Mom!
-Huh? What? Lisa, what's up?

16:43.711 --> 16:46.505
-I just had a bad dream.
-Oh, sure.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.966
You just lie down
and tell me all about it.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.926
Well, I know it's absurd,

16:51.010 --> 16:52.970
but I dreamed the bogeyman
was after me, and he's hiding--

16:53.053 --> 16:54.972
(screams)
Bogeyman!

16:55.055 --> 16:57.182
You nail the windows shut.
I'll get the gun.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.977
(grunts) Bart, I don't want
to alarm you,

17:00.060 --> 17:02.855
but there may be a bogeyman
or bogeymen in the house.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.023
(screams)

17:04.106 --> 17:06.567
(tires screeching)

17:10.279 --> 17:12.197
(trembling audibly)

17:12.281 --> 17:14.408
-(Bart and Lisa sighing)
-Hmm.

17:14.491 --> 17:17.619
-What happened here?
-Nothing, Marge. Just a little incident

17:17.703 --> 17:19.747
-involving the bogeyman!
-(gunshot)

17:19.830 --> 17:20.956
None of this would have happened

17:21.040 --> 17:23.792
if you had been here to keep me
from acting stupid!

17:23.876 --> 17:27.546
Oh, I'm sorry. I have been spending
too much time at the casino.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.548
I'll be around more
from now on.

17:29.631 --> 17:32.009
Does this mean you'll help me
with my costume?

17:32.092 --> 17:35.095
Oh, sure, honey.
I promise.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.598
-Thanks, Mom.
-Mmm.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.225
Aw, just like on TV.

17:40.309 --> 17:44.063
-(grunts)
-(canned laughter, applause)

17:46.565 --> 17:48.150
Hi. You from the casino?

17:48.233 --> 17:50.277
-I'm from a casino.
-Good enough. Let's go.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.404
(lights buzzing)

17:54.490 --> 17:57.159
I'm afraid Robert Goulet
hasn't arrived yet, sir.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.370
Hmm. Very well.
Begin the thawing of Jim Nabors.

18:00.454 --> 18:04.041
(panting)

18:04.124 --> 18:06.919
Are you sure this is the casino?

18:07.002 --> 18:09.046
I think I should
call my manager.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.590
Your manager says
for you to shut up!

18:11.673 --> 18:13.592
Vera said that?
Huh.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.345
(grunting)

18:16.428 --> 18:19.681
Dad! Mom said she'd be home
to help me with my costume.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.518
And she's not!
And the geography pageant is tonight!

18:22.601 --> 18:25.062
Lisa, your mom
still loves you.

18:25.145 --> 18:28.899
It's just that she has a career now.
She's a slot jockey.

18:28.982 --> 18:32.402
But, Dad, if I don't show up in a rubber
suit shaped like the state of Florida,

18:32.486 --> 18:35.239
I'll be the laughingstock
of the whole school.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.324
Oh, it's always something,
isn't it?

18:37.407 --> 18:40.285
First I have to drive your
pregnant mother to the hospital...

18:40.369 --> 18:42.538
so she can give birth to you,
and now this!

18:42.621 --> 18:45.707
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.918
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow!

18:50.504 --> 18:53.632
-Dad!
-(chuckling) Oh, yeah. The costume.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.510
Hello, "Floreda"!

18:56.593 --> 18:59.221

I'm not a state!

18:59.304 --> 19:01.974
I'm a monster!
(sobbing)

19:04.184 --> 19:06.770
No, Lisa. The only monster here
is the gambling monster...

19:06.854 --> 19:08.897
that has enslaved
your mother!

19:08.981 --> 19:10.983
I call him Gamblor!

19:11.066 --> 19:14.528
And it's time to snatch your mother
from his neon claws!

Fine. We'll transfer him

Oh, my beloved plant.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.737

-And, uh, the jars of urine?
-Oh, we'll hang on to those.

20:06.413 --> 20:09.124
Now, to the plant!
We'll take the Spruce Moose!

You made her cry.
Then I cried.

I'm so sorry.

You know,
you're right, Homer.
