02:17.902 --> 02:21.406
There you go.

02:21.407 --> 02:23.412
Good, bring it down. Bring
it down, bring it down.

02:26.412 --> 02:30.281
Whoo! Great! That was
the best one yet.

02:30.282 --> 02:31.816
You know, I think you might
be getting as good as me.

02:31.817 --> 02:34.686
You'll never be as good as me,
but you're getting there.

02:34.687 --> 02:36.928
- You're getting close.
- I'm way better than you.

02:36.955 --> 02:38.356
Perfect.

02:38.357 --> 02:39.924
What...

02:39.925 --> 02:42.260
What, are you trying to take a
little bit off the top right here?

02:42.261 --> 02:43.460
- Yeah, you need a haircut.
- Yeah.

02:43.461 --> 02:44.829
- Yeah.
- Watch this. Ready?

02:44.830 --> 02:47.698
Yeah, go.

02:47.699 --> 02:50.234
- Nice! Nice!
- See? Ready? Wait, wait.

02:50.235 --> 02:51.668
Upside down.

02:51.669 --> 02:54.305
- Boom!
- Nice! Nice!

02:54.306 --> 02:55.908
Oh, man, that was great, huh?

02:56.908 --> 02:59.410
Oh, yeah.

02:59.411 --> 03:01.846
- Turbulence. Turbulence.
- No.

03:01.847 --> 03:04.281
- Turbulence.
- Oh, no.

03:04.282 --> 03:05.949
- Turbulence!
- No, no!

03:05.950 --> 03:08.519
- Turbulence!
- Whoa. Ah!

03:08.520 --> 03:10.421
- Where is it?
- Turbulence.

03:10.422 --> 03:12.257
- It's over there. Where is it?
- No!

03:12.258 --> 03:13.591
Okay, bring her in
for a landing, now, okay?

03:13.592 --> 03:15.859
I got it.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.380
Right, nose down a little bit.

03:18.597 --> 03:20.632
Oh, it's windy.
It's windy.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.333
Can he do it? Can he do it?
Can he do it? Can he do...

03:22.334 --> 03:23.768
Aw...

03:23.769 --> 03:25.572
Oh! Whoo!

03:26.572 --> 03:27.871
Yeah!

03:27.872 --> 03:29.774
That is a dead stick,
my friend.

03:29.775 --> 03:32.043
Absolutely perfect,
bring it right in to us.

03:32.044 --> 03:33.978
Turn it, turn it,
turn it, turn it.

03:37.849 --> 03:39.551
What? Boosh!

03:40.551 --> 03:42.620
Unbelievable.

03:42.621 --> 03:44.422
Who taught you how to
do that, I wonder?

03:44.423 --> 03:46.958
I don't know.
I guess I... Instinct.

03:46.959 --> 03:48.393
- Instinct?
- Instinct!

03:48.394 --> 03:49.860
You know what you can do?

03:49.861 --> 03:51.596
You can shut up!

03:51.597 --> 03:52.463
You can shut up.

03:52.464 --> 03:53.764
No, you can shut up!

03:53.765 --> 03:54.799
I want a milkshake.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.302
You're not getting one.
You're getting buttermilk.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.403
Dude, did you see that landing?

03:58.404 --> 04:00.604
You get warm buttermilk.

04:00.605 --> 04:02.472
Thumbs out.
Big smiles.

04:02.473 --> 04:03.547
This one's a looker.

04:08.547 --> 04:10.748
- Hi
- Hi.

04:10.749 --> 04:13.351
Sorry, y'all, I don't
usually pick up hitchhikers.

04:13.352 --> 04:15.887
Especially people as
shady-looking as you are.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.422
Well, if it's the little dude you're
worried about I can vouch for him.

04:18.423 --> 04:21.426
Actually, you seem kind of
suspicious to me.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.061
If he looks so shady, Mom,
why'd you marry?

04:23.062 --> 04:24.962
I don't know.

04:24.963 --> 04:26.567
I ask myself that every day!

04:28.567 --> 04:31.035
All right, y'all ready
for some house-hunting?

04:31.036 --> 04:32.903
Haven't we hunted
every house in the city?

04:32.904 --> 04:34.571
Yeah, but we haven't
found one yet, Dad.

04:34.572 --> 04:36.874
And our lease is about to be up

04:36.875 --> 04:39.545
and we are gonna be out sleeping
under the Congress Avenue Bridge.

04:40.545 --> 04:42.879
- That's awesome.
- Not awesome.

04:42.880 --> 04:43.981
It is awesome.

04:43.982 --> 04:45.850
No. MICHAEL: Yes, it is.

04:45.851 --> 04:48.119
It's closer to the University.
I can walk to school.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.520
Yeah, I'd love to see
that happening!

04:51.790 --> 04:52.989
I hope you
brought your checkbook

04:52.990 --> 04:54.926
because this is the one!

04:54.927 --> 04:56.494
- This is it, huh?
- Yeah!

04:56.495 --> 04:57.695
Right, we haven't
heard that before.

04:57.696 --> 05:01.032
Oh! Hurry, come on. Before
someone else snaps up this gem!

05:01.033 --> 05:02.702
Oh, this one looks cute.

05:04.702 --> 05:06.703
Ah!

05:06.704 --> 05:09.640
Rosalba. It's not done.
Where are the walls?

05:09.641 --> 05:12.477
Oh, but you said,
"open plan." Open plan.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.645
No, no, no, no, we need, um...

05:14.646 --> 05:16.166
- Walls?
- We need a house that's done.

05:16.648 --> 05:20.551
Look. Walls! Uh?

05:20.552 --> 05:22.787
Huh. Yeah.

05:22.788 --> 05:24.989
But no windows, Rosalba.

05:24.990 --> 05:26.827
Uh, it's like a dungeon.

05:28.827 --> 05:30.528
I like this one.

05:30.529 --> 05:32.729
Hmm?

05:32.730 --> 05:33.630
Oh, yeah.

05:34.031 --> 05:36.434
- Yeah, windows!
- Look at this, man.

05:36.435 --> 05:38.602
That's good.
Light, natural light!

05:38.603 --> 05:40.470
Yes! This is, this is
a lot more our speed.

05:40.471 --> 05:41.806
- Rosalba, how much are we talking for this one?
- Uh-huh.

05:41.807 --> 05:42.707
- Yeah?
- Oh.

05:45.677 --> 05:48.879
Um...

05:48.880 --> 05:51.982
This one is just a touch
above your price range.

05:51.983 --> 05:53.717
- How much is a touch?
- Just a smidgen.

05:53.718 --> 05:55.619
- Like, 20?
- Above a hair.

05:55.620 --> 05:56.520
Forty? What?

05:59.091 --> 06:01.058
- More than 40?
- Come on. Let's go.

06:01.059 --> 06:02.527
- Rosalba!
- Come on, Rosalba.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.794
Ay...

06:03.795 --> 06:05.196
Did you find anything?

06:05.197 --> 06:06.830
- No.
- Nothing we can afford?

06:06.831 --> 06:08.698
Nothing we can afford.

06:08.699 --> 06:10.701
It's all right.

06:10.702 --> 06:13.102
Maybe we'll find something when
we get back from San Antonio.

06:14.072 --> 06:16.441
San Antonio?

06:16.442 --> 06:18.475
Uh-huh. Thanksgiving
with your family.

06:18.476 --> 06:20.210
We were there last month.

06:20.211 --> 06:22.780
I know, but this month it's
Thanksgiving with your family.

06:22.781 --> 06:25.581
So, now that there's a turkey on the
table, it's supposed to mean more?

06:27.786 --> 06:30.220
My dad probably put the Christmas
decorations up already.

06:30.221 --> 06:33.090
I did get a call
from your mom yesterday.

06:33.091 --> 06:35.993
She'd really love for us
to think about Christmas.

06:35.994 --> 06:37.160
Christmas, too?

06:37.161 --> 06:39.629
You know, David talks
about it all the time.

06:39.630 --> 06:40.765
I got a better idea.

06:40.766 --> 06:41.666
What?

06:42.634 --> 06:44.135
Cancun.

06:44.136 --> 06:45.903
Again with Cancun?

06:45.904 --> 06:48.873
If we order the tickets now
we get awesome rates

06:48.874 --> 06:52.109
and it's awesome-ly fun,
come on.

06:52.110 --> 06:54.744
- I just, I know...
- Think about it. Just think about it.

06:54.745 --> 06:56.746
I know Christmas
is hard for you.

06:56.747 --> 06:59.784
Sunshine. Beach.

06:59.785 --> 07:00.984
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.225
I know what you're waiting for.

07:02.488 --> 07:03.956
What?

07:04.956 --> 07:06.157
Massage.

07:06.158 --> 07:08.258
No! Not in the
creepy voice!

07:08.259 --> 07:09.260
- Massage.
- Not in the creepy voice.

07:09.261 --> 07:10.862
Give me a massage, yeah.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.162
Without the creepy voice.
Canc... Cancun.

07:12.163 --> 07:13.198
No.

07:13.199 --> 07:16.566
Where you get good massage.

07:16.567 --> 07:20.037
So, the ancient Greeks took the idea
of hospitality quite seriously.

07:20.038 --> 07:22.739
It could mean the difference
between life and death.

07:22.740 --> 07:24.542
For example...

07:24.543 --> 07:26.844
When Paris...

07:26.845 --> 07:28.578
Betrayed his host...

07:28.579 --> 07:30.047
And took Helen back to Troy...

07:30.048 --> 07:31.549
- Professor Walker?
Mmm-hmm?

07:31.550 --> 07:33.184
- One quick question?
- Go ahead.

07:33.185 --> 07:34.818
So you're saying
what the Greeks did

07:34.819 --> 07:36.686
is kind of like when
we celebrate Christmas?

07:37.788 --> 07:40.157
No, I'm saying just the
opposite as a matter of fact.

07:40.158 --> 07:42.292
Personal gatherings
and celebrations

07:42.293 --> 07:43.573
were powerful,
they were genuine.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.963
They were very spiritual
for the ancient Greeks.

07:46.964 --> 07:48.204
Just like Christmas for us now.

07:49.201 --> 07:51.568
Um...

07:51.569 --> 07:54.804
No, Christmas has become so
completely over-commercialized

07:54.805 --> 07:56.005
that's it's really lost any...

07:57.942 --> 08:00.143
Okay, Kylie, nice work.

08:00.144 --> 08:01.946
We've run out of time.

08:01.947 --> 08:03.814
See you Monday.

08:03.815 --> 08:06.985
Thank your friend here
for, uh, no homework.

08:07.985 --> 08:10.087
All right, watch the master now.
You watchin'?

08:10.088 --> 08:11.593
This is why I get paid
the big bucks.

08:15.593 --> 08:16.826
Ooh!

08:16.827 --> 08:18.307
That's your "S".
One more for "HORSE."

08:20.132 --> 08:22.198
We're playing
"HORSERADISH."

08:22.199 --> 08:23.301
That's, like,
seven more letters.

08:23.302 --> 08:24.936
Yeah, sure.

08:24.937 --> 08:25.837
Okay.

08:27.105 --> 08:28.873
If I make this one,

08:28.874 --> 08:31.075
we get to go to
San Antonio for Christmas.

08:31.076 --> 08:32.876
How 'bout if you
make this shot,

08:32.878 --> 08:34.278
you get to pick where we
go for lunch, all right?

08:34.312 --> 08:35.312
Come on, Dad.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.581
Grandpa said that he'd
put up so many lights,

08:37.582 --> 08:38.903
you could see it
from outer space.

08:41.953 --> 08:44.254
I don't doubt that.

08:44.255 --> 08:45.755
But we're going there
for Thanksgiving

08:45.756 --> 08:47.196
and I think that's
enough, all right?

08:48.726 --> 08:49.626
Go ahead, your shot.

08:57.235 --> 08:58.740
David.

09:02.740 --> 09:03.640
Okay.

09:05.110 --> 09:07.043
Wait.

09:07.044 --> 09:09.312
So, if I make this shot,

09:09.313 --> 09:10.874
we get to go to
Grandpa's for Christmas?

09:12.717 --> 09:14.687
I mean even if you don't.

09:26.999 --> 09:30.033
Hey, look. Grandpa put up
Burp, Snort and Poot.

09:30.034 --> 09:33.704
Yeah, he probably should just
leave 'em up all year round.

09:33.705 --> 09:34.638
- Whoo!
- Hey!

09:34.639 --> 09:36.641
Y'all made it!

09:36.642 --> 09:38.274
- Hey, hey!
- Look at that beauty, I love it!

09:38.275 --> 09:39.647
- Hey, Suze.
- Hey.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.980
Howdy y'all!
Yoo-hoo!

09:43.981 --> 09:46.883
Travis! Oh, honey!

09:46.884 --> 09:48.853
So happy you're
coming for Christmas.

09:48.854 --> 09:50.124
Yes. It's great.

09:52.124 --> 09:54.859
Good to see you!
You look beautiful.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.094
- Happy Thanksgiving. Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

09:57.095 --> 09:59.129
Come on in.

09:59.130 --> 10:01.264
Hey, brother. Hey, sis.

10:01.265 --> 10:04.368
So I hear you're here for
Thanksgiving and Christmas this year!

10:04.369 --> 10:06.737
- Grandpa!
- What did you do to your hair?

10:06.738 --> 10:08.109
David. God, you're
getting so big!

10:11.109 --> 10:12.209
Hey, Pop.

10:12.210 --> 10:13.114
Michael.

10:16.114 --> 10:18.416
Wanna help me get
the food inside?

10:18.417 --> 10:20.216
- See you in there.
- See you in there.

10:20.217 --> 10:22.952
Here's my fruitcake!

10:22.953 --> 10:24.455
Da-dah! Oh, wow!

10:24.456 --> 10:25.989
Is that jalapenos?

10:25.990 --> 10:27.992
Close, there's jalapenos

10:27.993 --> 10:29.859
and poblanos and habaneros.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.162
So, do you want
to try it? Come on.

10:31.163 --> 10:32.897
- It's really...
- Um...

10:32.898 --> 10:35.166
I call it my
"three peppers fruitcake."

10:35.167 --> 10:36.933
- I'm gonna have a little taste...
- Just a little?

10:36.934 --> 10:38.835
...'cause I don't wanna,
I don't wanna fill up.

10:38.836 --> 10:40.470
- Well, you're gonna want more, because it's really amazing.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:40.471 --> 10:42.273
Despite all these chilies,

10:42.274 --> 10:43.874
you can still taste the pickles

10:43.875 --> 10:46.177
and the pineapples and the prunes!

10:46.178 --> 10:47.378
Try this, it's so good!

10:47.379 --> 10:49.312
You gotta try
Claire's fruitcake!

10:49.313 --> 10:51.481
It's kind of like an explosion
of flavor in your mouth!

10:51.482 --> 10:54.284
I worked so hard on it.
I made 12. I made a dozen.

10:54.285 --> 10:56.754
One for everybody in the family.
We all get one?

10:56.755 --> 10:58.822
Oh, Claire!

10:58.823 --> 11:00.957
Hey! MAGGIE: Hey! Aunt Jocelyn!

11:00.958 --> 11:02.826
You made it!

11:02.827 --> 11:04.729
Of course we made it!

11:04.730 --> 11:07.064
Everyone, you remember Bob?

11:07.065 --> 11:09.365
He, uh... That's your
second husband, right?

11:09.366 --> 11:11.071
Oh, God, no!
Totally different Bob!

11:24.816 --> 11:26.316
All in.

11:31.756 --> 11:33.389
You are so bluffing.

11:33.390 --> 11:36.261
<i>♪ When you dance,
you go, cha, cha, cha</i>

11:37.261 --> 11:38.382

11:45.035 --> 11:46.403
Yeah!

11:46.404 --> 11:48.538

11:48.539 --> 11:50.774
- Aw!

11:50.775 --> 11:52.276
Yeah, yeah!

11:52.277 --> 11:53.253
Whoo! Momma wins!

12:01.253 --> 12:03.990
David! What are you
doing, man?

12:04.990 --> 12:06.856
Are you crazy?

12:06.857 --> 12:07.994
Think that's sweet enough?

12:08.994 --> 12:11.262
- Yeah.
- Ahh-ha-ha-ha-ha!

12:11.263 --> 12:12.963
Oh, everybody's tasting!

12:12.964 --> 12:15.465
Mmm. Well, I might
as well do the same.

12:17.134 --> 12:18.201
I'm going to do it!

12:20.337 --> 12:22.239
Get out of my way!
Shut up! I'm doing it!

12:22.240 --> 12:23.875
What is going on?

12:24.875 --> 12:28.045
You have lost your mind!

12:28.046 --> 12:30.480
No, 'cause, see,
there's a, there's a spring.

12:30.481 --> 12:32.516
- Okay. Uh-huh.
- Yeah, I've...

12:32.517 --> 12:34.151
See, it's... We're good.
We're good!

12:34.152 --> 12:35.518
We're good to go.
I fixed it.

12:35.519 --> 12:37.120
He was just making sure
it was safe.

12:37.121 --> 12:39.156
I see that.

12:39.157 --> 12:41.057
- Right, Dad?
- Yeah, I got it. I did it.

12:41.058 --> 12:42.330
Yeah!

12:53.238 --> 12:54.604

15:21.019 --> 15:22.020
Thank you, Ma.

15:23.020 --> 15:25.390
So, Grandpa, when are you gonna
put the Christmas lights up?

15:26.390 --> 15:27.490
Oh...

15:27.491 --> 15:29.759
Maybe tonight after supper.

15:29.760 --> 15:33.229
I thought you and Travis might
help me untangle all those lights.

15:33.230 --> 15:34.697
It's a big job.

15:34.698 --> 15:37.100
That sounds like
a good job for y'all.

15:37.101 --> 15:38.601
Uh, hmmm.

15:38.602 --> 15:40.504
Hey, Dad, when we
come down for Christmas,

15:40.505 --> 15:43.273
could we stay the whole week?

15:43.274 --> 15:46.176
Oh, yeah. Yes.

15:46.177 --> 15:48.278
I like that idea.

15:48.279 --> 15:50.380
Great idea.

15:50.381 --> 15:51.861
We're, we're not
coming for Christmas.

15:54.619 --> 15:57.354
What? Why?

15:57.355 --> 15:59.590
You're kidding. Why?

15:59.591 --> 16:00.528
It's Christmas.

16:03.528 --> 16:04.449
Well, that's that then.

16:09.333 --> 16:10.701
Let's eat up here, folks,

16:10.702 --> 16:12.603
that turkey's gonna get cold.

16:31.822 --> 16:33.292
Hey, son.

16:34.292 --> 16:35.628
Hey.

16:44.168 --> 16:45.538
Years ago,

16:46.538 --> 16:48.504
when I was a kid,

16:48.505 --> 16:51.844
the whole family used to go to your
great-grandpa's house for Christmas.

16:52.844 --> 16:53.744
The one by the lake?

16:55.113 --> 16:56.013
Yeah.

16:57.816 --> 17:00.283
And one Christmas
in particular I remember

17:00.284 --> 17:02.724
because I was your age and Uncle
David was about a year older,

17:04.320 --> 17:07.590
and all we wanted
was one present

17:07.592 --> 17:08.592
<i>for Christmas, you know.</i>

17:09.527 --> 17:10.426
<i>Just one.</i>

17:12.195 --> 17:14.097
Racers.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.733
You know what that is?

17:16.733 --> 17:18.805
<i>Ice skates.
That's all we wanted.</i>

17:20.805 --> 17:22.771
So after lunch,

17:22.772 --> 17:25.241
<i>we snuck out of the house
and went down to the lake.</i>

17:25.242 --> 17:27.678
We were gonna race.

17:27.679 --> 17:29.960
Now, you gotta remember something
about Uncle David. He...

17:31.449 --> 17:33.217
<i>He was older than I was,
you know.</i>

17:33.218 --> 17:35.379
<i>So he is a better skater.
He's faster, he's stronger.</i>

17:37.255 --> 17:38.557
So, one, two three, go!

17:40.557 --> 17:42.595
Flying down the ice,
and guess what?

17:43.595 --> 17:44.555
I was winning this time.

17:46.163 --> 17:47.864
I was beating him.

17:47.865 --> 17:51.134
For the first time in my life,
I was beating him.

17:51.135 --> 17:52.536
And I'm skating
as hard as I can.

17:52.537 --> 17:54.505
<i>I hear him calling my name.</i>

17:54.506 --> 17:55.706
Michael, Michael!

17:57.275 --> 17:59.509
I didn't stop though
'cause I...

17:59.510 --> 18:01.210
I knew he was playing
one of those tricks on me.

18:01.211 --> 18:03.146
You know, he was trying to get
me to stop so he could...

18:03.147 --> 18:04.047
Skate past me.

18:04.048 --> 18:05.716
<i>So I kept going, I kept going.</i>

18:05.717 --> 18:06.851
<i>I was winning, you know.</i>

18:06.852 --> 18:08.612
<i>I was going to beat him
for the first time.</i>

18:10.387 --> 18:12.588
And he caught up to me,

18:12.589 --> 18:15.392
and he grabbed
ahold of my jacket

18:15.393 --> 18:18.231
<i>and swung me around
as hard as he could.</i>

18:21.231 --> 18:22.233
And I fell down.

18:23.233 --> 18:25.335
And I went sliding

18:25.336 --> 18:27.874
with my face on the ice
toward the shore.

18:31.742 --> 18:33.847
I heard the ice cracking.

18:36.847 --> 18:37.747
I could, um...

18:40.617 --> 18:42.490
I could feel it cracking.

18:45.490 --> 18:46.729
I looked up...

18:51.729 --> 18:52.938
And, um, I didn't see him.

18:59.938 --> 19:02.233
And that's why
Uncle David isn't here.

19:29.233 --> 19:30.803
Mmm.

19:31.803 --> 19:32.703
You did it.

19:34.605 --> 19:35.773
How do you feel?

19:36.773 --> 19:38.874
I'm really glad I told him.

19:38.875 --> 19:40.779
- I am too.
- Michael?

19:42.779 --> 19:44.683
I'll let y'all talk.

19:46.683 --> 19:49.885
I got a favor to ask.

19:49.886 --> 19:53.325
We'd like David to stay with
us here for a few days.

19:54.325 --> 19:56.293
Not for Christmas,

19:56.294 --> 19:58.862
but just a few days before
when he gets out of school.

19:58.863 --> 20:00.764
Yeah, I don't...
I don't know, Pop.

20:00.765 --> 20:02.298
You know, um...

20:02.299 --> 20:03.467
You and Ma kinda...

20:03.468 --> 20:05.635
We're getting old and creaky.

20:07.505 --> 20:10.374
Maybe so.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.314
But I think we can take care of
a 10-year-old for a few days.

20:16.314 --> 20:17.548
Okay.

20:18.548 --> 20:19.448
Thank you, Michael.

23:21.097 --> 23:23.499
Oh, well, I...

23:23.500 --> 23:25.860
I tried riding it, but you can
see how well that turned out.

23:27.171 --> 23:30.574

23:47.023 --> 23:47.923

23:50.560 --> 23:52.499
Oh, I don't know.

know, I like to keep busy.

24:33.604 --> 24:34.940

24:35.940 --> 24:38.240
Oh.

24:38.241 --> 24:40.041
- I don't know what to say, man, it's incredible.
Mmm-hmm.

24:40.044 --> 24:41.845

24:53.223 --> 24:55.624

24:55.625 --> 24:57.160
After you have seen the whole
place here, what do you think?

24:57.161 --> 25:00.896
I gotta tell you, I think it's the
most beautiful house I've ever seen.

25:00.897 --> 25:03.167
And I've completely
wasted your time.

25:04.167 --> 25:06.569
Oh?

25:06.570 --> 25:09.072
This, this place is,
is way outta my price range.

25:09.073 --> 25:13.242
I mean, way out of
my price range.

25:13.243 --> 25:16.145
To tell you the truth, I don't have
any idea what this place is worth.

25:16.146 --> 25:18.815
Uh, why don't you
make me an offer?

25:18.816 --> 25:21.284
Just, uh, write it down,
the old school time way.

25:21.285 --> 25:22.852
Yeah, um...

25:22.853 --> 25:24.254
Mister?

25:24.255 --> 25:27.190
- Call me Nick.
- Nick, yeah, I, uh...

25:27.191 --> 25:30.693
I've looked at property for about a
year around here with my wife...

25:30.694 --> 25:32.595
And, um...

25:32.596 --> 25:34.864
I have a pretty good idea
what this house is worth.

25:34.865 --> 25:36.669
Mmm-hmm, so, show me.

25:38.669 --> 25:39.569
Okay.

25:41.172 --> 25:42.641
All right, uh...

25:43.641 --> 25:44.708
Got a pen?

25:44.709 --> 25:45.609
Sure.

25:53.250 --> 25:54.221
Uh.

25:58.221 --> 25:59.192
That's a feather.

26:01.192 --> 26:02.696
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:06.696 --> 26:08.257
This is easily twice
what we can afford.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.920
So this is what you think
is a fair honest price?

26:11.001 --> 26:13.737
Yes, sir.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.405
Well, you're either the most
honest guy I've ever met or...

26:16.406 --> 26:17.941
The dumbest.

26:17.942 --> 26:19.409
Take your pick.

26:19.410 --> 26:21.310
Either way, it don't matter.
Buy you a lemonade.

26:21.311 --> 26:24.247
Sounds great.

26:24.248 --> 26:27.083

- Yes.

26:33.057 --> 26:35.191

26:35.192 --> 26:36.127

26:37.127 --> 26:39.129
Piece of work?

26:39.130 --> 26:41.264
Several pieces.

26:41.265 --> 26:43.133
Yeah, well.

26:43.134 --> 26:45.134
He'll get into a lot of trouble
running around this big old house.

26:45.135 --> 26:47.103
Man, you're not kidding.

26:47.104 --> 26:49.139
Hmm, well, let's do it!

26:49.140 --> 26:52.741
- Excuse me?
- You wanna buy the house or not?

26:52.742 --> 26:56.278
Nick, I've already told you.
I can barely afford

26:56.279 --> 26:57.913
half of what
this place is worth.

26:57.914 --> 27:00.383
Well, if you can afford
half of what it's worth,

27:00.384 --> 27:02.218
half is what
I'm gonna charge you.

27:02.219 --> 27:03.379
- What?
- It's important to me

27:04.020 --> 27:06.422
that the right family
wind up in this house.

27:06.423 --> 27:07.923
I'll take half.

27:07.924 --> 27:09.992
You're not serious?

27:09.993 --> 27:11.861
I'm serious as a heart attack.

27:11.862 --> 27:13.229
You trying to weasel
out of the deal?

27:13.230 --> 27:14.931
No, I just might...

27:14.932 --> 27:17.400
I need an answer right now.

27:17.401 --> 27:20.836
I'm taking a huge
leap of faith with you

27:20.837 --> 27:23.710
and I need us to leap together.
What do you say?

27:25.710 --> 27:28.178
Yes! Yes! Yes!

27:28.179 --> 27:30.217
We got a deal.
Oh, one condition.

27:33.217 --> 27:36.352
The people in this neighborhood take
a lot of pride in it, you know.

27:36.353 --> 27:38.387
So you gotta
do the right thing.

27:38.388 --> 27:40.757
It's important that
you keep the lawn mowed

27:40.758 --> 27:42.826
and you can't
paint the house pink.

27:42.827 --> 27:45.495
It's important that you keep
up the neighborhood standards.

27:45.496 --> 27:46.396
I understand.

27:47.298 --> 27:49.065
No pink.

27:49.066 --> 27:49.966
It's very important.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.867
I get it.

27:51.868 --> 27:53.903
Absolutely. No problem.

27:53.904 --> 27:55.874
Congratulations, you got
yourself a house.

27:56.874 --> 27:58.442
Oh, I...

27:59.442 --> 28:01.981
My wife's gonna...

28:12.155 --> 28:13.456
Hey, Susan?

28:15.859 --> 28:17.960
Hey!

28:17.961 --> 28:19.929
It took you forever.

28:19.930 --> 28:20.830
Where you been?

28:22.266 --> 28:23.399
What?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.901
I bought a house.

28:24.902 --> 28:26.970
What?

28:26.971 --> 28:29.905
I think he just said that
he bought a house.

28:29.906 --> 28:31.386
What do you mean
"you bought a house"?

28:33.277 --> 28:34.877
I wrecked my bike.

28:34.878 --> 28:36.945
I'm walking it down the street,

28:36.946 --> 28:38.847
and on the right side of the
street is this unbelievable house.

28:38.848 --> 28:40.450
Unbelievable house. There's an
old man sitting on the porch,

28:40.451 --> 28:41.985
says, "You want it?
You can buy it,

28:41.986 --> 28:43.219
"but you have to
buy it right now.

28:43.220 --> 28:45.154
"You can't wait, you have
to buy it right now."

28:45.155 --> 28:47.323
I bought a house, Susan.

28:47.324 --> 28:49.459
Hold on. You didn't
sign a contract?

28:49.460 --> 28:51.128
I signed the contract. What?

28:52.128 --> 28:54.130
I tried calling you,

28:54.131 --> 28:55.498
but I got your voicemail.

28:55.499 --> 28:57.179
- Hold on.
- I got your voicemail.

28:58.803 --> 29:00.103
What?

29:00.104 --> 29:03.206
I'm gonna get between
you and the knives.

29:03.207 --> 29:05.441
Because I don't want you to do
something that you're gonna regret.

29:05.442 --> 29:07.576
You sign a contract. You bought
a house without consulting me.

29:07.577 --> 29:08.814
Without consulting us.

29:09.814 --> 29:10.714
Yes.

29:13.049 --> 29:14.883
Michael.

29:14.884 --> 29:16.920
Did you get scammed?

29:16.921 --> 29:18.354
Okay, do you think
I got scammed?

29:18.355 --> 29:20.222
I did not get scammed.

29:20.223 --> 29:21.924
I mean, you fall off your bike,

29:21.925 --> 29:24.227
some man walks up to you,
takes you to his "mansion"?

29:24.228 --> 29:25.929
Susan, it happened so fast.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.564
Hey, Mom? After you
finish killing Dad,

29:27.565 --> 29:28.686
can we go look at our house?

29:33.203 --> 29:34.938
Let's go right now.
Come on!

29:34.939 --> 29:36.306
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

29:36.307 --> 29:37.239
Let's go right now.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.441
Let's see this house.

29:38.442 --> 29:39.402
Dude, you're in trouble.

29:47.050 --> 29:48.985
Hey, Nick! NICK: Hey.

29:48.986 --> 29:50.185
How are you doing?

29:50.186 --> 29:51.453
Didn't think we'd come back?

29:51.454 --> 29:53.155
Welcome back.

29:53.156 --> 29:54.556
Good to see you. You too.

29:54.557 --> 29:56.526
Got my family.
This is my wife, Susan.

29:56.527 --> 29:58.260
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi, Susan. How are you?

29:58.261 --> 29:59.996
- My son, David.
- Hey, David.

29:59.997 --> 30:02.158
Hello. Come on,
let me show you the house.

30:08.972 --> 30:10.308
Hmm. Hmm.

30:12.308 --> 30:13.912
Are those crown moldings
up there?

30:14.912 --> 30:17.180
- Yes, yes.
- Beautiful.

30:17.181 --> 30:19.181
- I like that fireplace.
- Yes, ma'am.

30:19.182 --> 30:20.452
Mmm.

30:21.452 --> 30:22.813
- Eleven foot ceilings?
- Twelve.

30:23.654 --> 30:25.990
Twelve.

30:26.990 --> 30:28.156
Hmm.

30:28.157 --> 30:30.058
Oh, nice hardwood floors.
Yes, ma'am.

30:30.059 --> 30:32.194
Ah-ha.

30:32.195 --> 30:33.632
Oh, wow.

30:34.632 --> 30:36.231
Blue ceilings,
that's interesting.

30:36.232 --> 30:37.467
That keeps out the bees.

30:37.468 --> 30:39.302
- I knew that.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:39.303 --> 30:40.203
It's in the almanac.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.105
I'd heard that,
I had heard that.

30:43.106 --> 30:44.473
Is this a pantry?

30:44.474 --> 30:46.643
- Yes, it is.
- Oh!

30:46.644 --> 30:49.312
I've always wanted a pantry.

30:49.313 --> 30:51.647
I don't even know what a pantry is.
I know, honey.

30:51.648 --> 30:54.287
Oh, this is just
gorgeous, my goodness.

30:58.689 --> 31:01.257
That is a beautiful room.
Thank you, yes, it is.

31:01.258 --> 31:03.625
Is this all original? This, that,
the bead-board up there, you know?

31:03.626 --> 31:05.327
Uh, yes it is, every bit.

31:05.328 --> 31:06.288
Oh, my goodness.

31:07.131 --> 31:09.364
Wow!

31:09.365 --> 31:11.334
We have a pool?

31:11.335 --> 31:13.201
You didn't tell me
there was a pool!

31:13.202 --> 31:15.337
Of course there's a pool.

31:15.338 --> 31:18.473
I'm sorry, uh, kid. The pool's
not included in the deal.

31:18.474 --> 31:20.075
Wait, what?

31:20.076 --> 31:20.976
Just kidding.

31:26.717 --> 31:28.757
I still can't believe you
bought a house without me.

31:29.653 --> 31:32.087
I think I'll give you
a pass this time, but...

31:33.523 --> 31:37.993
I've already picked out my
room, and it is awesome!

31:37.994 --> 31:40.697
Well, you know, your husband
here should've checked with you

31:40.698 --> 31:43.633
before he made the deal,
you know, but I...

31:43.634 --> 31:46.435
I have to admit
I kinda pushed him into it.

31:46.436 --> 31:48.337
But say the word and I'll tear
the contract up right now.

31:48.338 --> 31:50.105
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

31:52.409 --> 31:55.044
Well in that case...

31:55.045 --> 31:57.565
Y'all come back tomorrow and I'll
have the keys waiting for you.

31:59.215 --> 32:01.416
I just, I...

32:01.417 --> 32:02.652
I can't help but feel like

32:02.653 --> 32:05.421
we're gonna wake up from some
wonderful dream or something.

32:05.422 --> 32:08.056
Yeah, this is,
this is unbelievable.

32:08.057 --> 32:10.338
Y'all turn this place into a
home, and we'll call it even.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.465
Okay.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.471
Could you pull up
to this house every day?

32:21.471 --> 32:24.539
Oh, my gosh, my gosh.

32:24.540 --> 32:26.508
How are you gonna ask him to
get his stuff out of here?

32:26.509 --> 32:27.610
Why do I have to ask him?

32:27.611 --> 32:30.546
'Cause you have to ask.

32:30.547 --> 32:33.316
It takes a long time to move
all that beautiful stuff out.

32:33.317 --> 32:34.438
- Is he here?
- I don't know.

32:36.286 --> 32:37.761
Hey, Nick?

32:44.761 --> 32:45.661
Hello?

32:47.431 --> 32:48.471
Where is everything?

32:57.040 --> 32:58.175
Oh!

32:59.175 --> 33:00.675
My gosh.

33:00.676 --> 33:01.781
Unbelievable.

33:04.781 --> 33:06.382
You're not getting tired,
are you, man?

33:06.383 --> 33:08.383
- Nope.
- Get up there.

33:08.384 --> 33:10.318
Oh, good, honey, those can
go right into your cabinets.

33:10.319 --> 33:11.787
Mmm-hmm.

33:11.788 --> 33:14.089
I can't believe how
big the bedroom is.

33:14.090 --> 33:16.392
You could fit five families
in that bedroom.

33:16.393 --> 33:17.460
But we don't have to!

33:31.407 --> 33:32.775
Welcome to the neighborhood!

33:32.776 --> 33:35.077
We're the Oswalts from
right across the street.

33:35.078 --> 33:36.778
I'm Laura and this is Griffin.

33:38.449 --> 33:41.183
Wow, I'm, uh, I'm Michael.
Susan. David. Hi.

33:41.184 --> 33:42.451
Well, here you go!

33:42.452 --> 33:44.319
This'll get you started!

33:44.320 --> 33:46.389
- Oh! Thank you!
- Get us started?

33:46.390 --> 33:48.691
Nothing fancy. Just
a dozen or so strings.

33:48.692 --> 33:50.358
Crackle.
Clear finish.

33:50.359 --> 33:51.693
Christmas lights.

33:51.694 --> 33:54.262
My dad loves Christmas lights.

33:54.263 --> 33:55.864
Don't you, Dad?

33:55.865 --> 33:58.567
Yeah? Didn't Nick tell you about
the neighborhood tradition?

33:58.568 --> 34:01.370
No, no-no-no. What's the
neighborhood tradition?

34:01.371 --> 34:03.472
- Oh!
- Every year all the neighbors come caroling

34:03.473 --> 34:05.740
and bringing over their
Christmas decorations for Nick.

34:05.741 --> 34:06.875
For you now!

34:06.876 --> 34:08.210
This is Live Oak Lane.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.112
The Live Oak Lane.

34:10.114 --> 34:13.149
During the holidays, we're the
most famous street in Austin.

34:13.150 --> 34:14.649
The Live Oak Lane
Trail of Lights.

34:14.650 --> 34:16.752
This is that Live Oak Lane?

34:16.753 --> 34:19.121
Yeah! Pretty cool, huh, Dad?

34:19.123 --> 34:20.554
Everybody decorates.

34:20.556 --> 34:22.424
Every year we all go all out.

34:22.425 --> 34:25.393
People from all over the world
come here just to see our street.

34:25.393 --> 34:27.496
Oh! GRIFFIN: Nick's
house, your house,

34:27.498 --> 34:29.165
is always the crown jewel.

34:29.166 --> 34:31.868
That's why we bring over
so many lights every year,

34:31.869 --> 34:34.349
so that your house will be even
more spectacular than the last.

34:37.141 --> 34:38.241
Thank you.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.574
Oh, yeah!

34:39.576 --> 34:41.377
And I'll be happy to
give you a hand.

34:41.378 --> 34:43.812
Putting so many lights on a
house this size is a big job.

34:43.813 --> 34:45.580
Wouldn't wanna be a bother.

34:45.581 --> 34:47.460
No trouble at all, I can
come over this evening.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.754
We are so busy, uh,

34:51.755 --> 34:55.290
unpacking, with the move,
and there's just...

34:55.291 --> 34:57.826
Stuff. We'll definitely
try to get around to it.

34:57.827 --> 34:59.462
They'll try
to get around to it!

35:01.797 --> 35:03.765
All right.
Thanks a lot.

35:03.766 --> 35:05.935
Great to meet y'all,
thank you so much.

35:05.936 --> 35:07.376
Nice to meet y'all.
Nice to meet you!

35:08.338 --> 35:10.705
- Bye.
- Bye-bye!

35:10.706 --> 35:12.867
Well, they seem nice, don't they?

35:15.445 --> 35:18.680
The Live Oak Lane
Trail of Lights.

35:18.681 --> 35:24.520
Michael Walker moves into the
Live Oak Lane Trail of Lights.

35:24.521 --> 35:26.421
- That's funny.
- It's not funny.

35:26.422 --> 35:28.390
It's pretty funny!

35:28.391 --> 35:30.259
And I think if our neighbors
are gonna be so generous

35:30.260 --> 35:32.395
as to give us all these
beautiful lights,

35:32.396 --> 35:34.397
the least we could do
is put them up.

35:34.398 --> 35:36.665
Yeah, come on, Dad, it's
the neighborhood tradition.

35:36.666 --> 35:38.600
Don't you want
our neighbors to like us?

35:38.601 --> 35:41.337
No, I wanna understand why
people spend days and days

35:41.338 --> 35:43.738
putting up thousands and
thousands of Christmas lights

35:43.739 --> 35:45.607
so that people can
walk past their house

35:45.608 --> 35:46.508
and ooh and aah.

35:48.445 --> 35:50.413
How about hours
and hours putting up

35:50.414 --> 35:52.448
hundreds and
hundreds of lights?

35:52.449 --> 35:54.951
Or minutes and minutes putting
up dozens and dozens?

35:54.952 --> 35:57.285
How about no time
putting up no lights?

35:57.286 --> 35:58.966
I think our neighbors
will understand that.

36:01.824 --> 36:02.984

37:48.931 --> 37:50.501
I know, man,
I'm pretty blown away.

37:51.501 --> 37:52.701
Yeah!

37:52.702 --> 37:55.604
And this, this is
Live Oak Lane.

37:55.605 --> 37:56.708
Yeah, it sure is.

37:57.708 --> 37:58.629
It's the Live Oak Lane.

38:03.079 --> 38:05.480
Yep.

38:05.481 --> 38:08.049
Like, Trail of Lights

Yes, it is. It's...
Yes, it is.

38:14.358 --> 38:16.759
Wow. Live Oak Lane.

38:16.760 --> 38:17.728
Okay, I got a question.

38:18.728 --> 38:20.663
For the kids.

38:20.664 --> 38:22.598
Me and Uncle Jeff.

38:22.599 --> 38:23.866
Fist fight.
Who wins?

38:25.402 --> 38:27.370
Uncle Jeff.

38:27.371 --> 38:28.703
What do yo mean, Uncle Jeff?

38:28.704 --> 38:30.105
- It's the reach.
- Daddy!

38:30.106 --> 38:31.806
But I got street skills.
I have street skills.

38:31.807 --> 38:33.509
Ooh! Honey!

38:33.510 --> 38:35.076
We'll talk about this
in a minute.

38:35.077 --> 38:36.977
- There's the door, I think that's for you.
- Yeah, whatever.

38:36.978 --> 38:38.381
- This is 20 times.
- What?

38:38.382 --> 38:39.547
This is incredible.

38:39.548 --> 38:40.783
I know.

38:40.784 --> 38:41.716
This is gonna drive him...

38:41.717 --> 38:42.884
It's driving him crazy.

38:42.885 --> 38:44.153
- Mom, listen.
- Crazy.

38:44.154 --> 38:45.421
I love this one.

38:45.422 --> 38:46.555
I know, it's...

38:46.556 --> 38:47.917
They're wonderful,
but of course...

38:48.023 --> 38:50.058
Who was it, honey?

38:50.059 --> 38:52.395
Who was it? Was it
door-to-door salesmen?

38:52.396 --> 38:54.796
- Oh. What'd ya get?
- Oh!

38:54.797 --> 38:55.878
Was it the Christmas girls?

38:57.634 --> 38:59.067
- Whoa, whoa.
- Wait, little man.

38:59.068 --> 39:00.970
Whoa, whoa, no,
come here, come here.

39:00.971 --> 39:02.171
Bye, Mom.

39:02.172 --> 39:03.906
Bye, honey.

39:03.907 --> 39:05.908
What am I gonna do without you?
I don't know.

39:05.909 --> 39:06.942
Dad.

39:06.943 --> 39:08.412
I don't know, you're
leaving me alone with him?

39:08.413 --> 39:10.178
I know what I'm gonna do. I'm
gonna get some sleep finally.

39:10.179 --> 39:11.916
- Yeah.
- Hey, do me a favor.

39:12.916 --> 39:14.950
I need you to take care
of Grandpa for me.

39:14.951 --> 39:16.551
- Okay.
- You promise?

39:16.552 --> 39:18.587
Promise. All right,
man, give me a hug.

39:18.588 --> 39:20.122
- I love you.
- Love you too, Dad.

39:20.123 --> 39:21.790
Be safe, now. I will.

39:21.791 --> 39:23.192
- All right.
- Okay. I love you, Mom.

39:23.193 --> 39:24.692
- Call us.
- Okay.

39:24.693 --> 39:26.529
Have a fun time, most of all.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.438
Yep, okay, I'll... See
you whenever I get back.

40:32.596 --> 40:33.796
Ho.

40:33.797 --> 40:34.697
Ho.

40:36.666 --> 40:37.905
Ho.

40:41.905 --> 40:45.274
You think you might think about
putting up some lights this year?

40:45.275 --> 40:48.148
Just because of the new house
and it'd be so fun for David.

40:53.148 --> 40:54.048
Maybe?

40:58.188 --> 41:00.893
- I'll get it.
- It's for you.

41:02.893 --> 41:04.795
Howdy, Michael.

41:06.795 --> 41:08.930
What is that, Griffin?

41:08.931 --> 41:11.299
It's a ladder.

41:11.300 --> 41:13.569
You know, I got to thinking I bet I know
why Michael hadn't put his lights up yet.

41:13.570 --> 41:15.539
He needs a ladder.

41:16.539 --> 41:17.805
I don't.

41:17.806 --> 41:19.274
So, you have one already?

41:19.275 --> 41:20.612
No.

41:22.612 --> 41:25.333
Michael, Christmas here on Live Oak
Lane is really something special.

41:26.016 --> 41:27.950
Everybody's included.

41:27.951 --> 41:31.287
We got a Jewish family, a Muslim
family, there's a family from India.

41:31.288 --> 41:33.756
Heck, they got a Santa Clause
with four arms and three eyes.

41:33.757 --> 41:34.924
It'll blow your mind.

41:34.925 --> 41:36.860
That's great.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.662
Look, Michael.

41:39.663 --> 41:41.830
These lights and these
decorations mean a whole lot

41:41.831 --> 41:43.000
to a whole lot of people.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.935
Last year, a family flew here all the
way from Japan, just to see 'em.

41:46.936 --> 41:49.605
That's wonderful.

41:49.606 --> 41:51.941
I don't mean to poke my nose
into your business...

41:51.942 --> 41:53.318
- But...
- Then don't.

42:02.318 --> 42:05.220
Boy, you don't think we have
enough lights up there, already?

42:05.221 --> 42:06.754
No way.

42:06.755 --> 42:08.156
Let's put them all up.

42:08.157 --> 42:12.097
You know, I haven't used these
lights for a long time.

42:14.097 --> 42:16.101
Maybe we better test 'em.

42:19.101 --> 42:20.605
They still work.

42:22.672 --> 42:25.844
I'll bet these lights
haven't been used since...

42:28.844 --> 42:31.814
Since your father,
your uncle and I used them.

42:31.815 --> 42:34.183
My dad used to help you
put Christmas lights up?

42:34.184 --> 42:35.783
He sure did.

42:35.784 --> 42:37.953
I remember one Christmas,

42:37.954 --> 42:40.324
when the three of us put up so
many lights, the roof sagged!

42:42.324 --> 42:43.725
No, it didn't.

42:43.726 --> 42:45.127
It did.

42:45.128 --> 42:48.333
And then, your father said, we have
to remember Burp, Snort, and Poot.

42:50.333 --> 42:51.834
So, up they went on the roof

42:51.835 --> 42:54.636
and the roof sagged even more.

42:54.637 --> 42:57.110
Till everyone had to crawl
around on their hands and knees.

43:48.391 --> 43:50.359
One more question.

43:50.360 --> 43:52.828
Are there gonna be camel rides through
the neighborhood for the kiddos?

43:52.829 --> 43:53.729
Watch out!

43:56.465 --> 43:58.751
Sorry, mister.

45:15.945 --> 45:21.917
Well. He insists on doing
his packing all by himself.

45:21.918 --> 45:26.522
He told me, "Grandma, I'm
not a little kid anymore!"

45:26.523 --> 45:28.524
He's not.

45:28.525 --> 45:30.195
Hey, what's this?

45:32.195 --> 45:34.129
I thought I might
take it with us

45:34.130 --> 45:37.064
when I drive David back up to Austin.

45:37.065 --> 45:38.901
What? Give it to Michael.

45:38.902 --> 45:40.838
Just in case.

45:42.838 --> 45:45.811
Oh, honey, you think
that's a good idea?

45:47.811 --> 45:50.554
I don't have
any others left, darling.

45:58.554 --> 46:01.390
Hey, Grandpa,
I just thought of something.

46:01.391 --> 46:04.892
Maybe we could wait a few
hours before we drive back.

46:04.893 --> 46:05.793
Till after dinner.

46:07.230 --> 46:10.165
And why would we wanna do that?

46:10.166 --> 46:13.538
Well, because then we could see the
lights on the house lit up before I go.

46:15.538 --> 46:17.538
Your father
won't like it, David.

46:17.539 --> 46:20.308
I told him I'd have you
home before dark.

46:20.309 --> 46:23.212
Yeah, but we'd only be there
just a tiny bit after dark.

46:23.213 --> 46:25.848
So he'll only be
a tiny bit mad.

46:25.849 --> 46:27.181
David.

46:27.182 --> 46:28.584
Please, Grandpa.

46:28.585 --> 46:29.484
I mean...

46:29.485 --> 46:33.355
We worked so hard
on the lights and...

46:33.356 --> 46:35.230
It'll be my only chance
to really see them.

46:40.230 --> 46:42.263
Five minutes at dusk.

46:42.264 --> 46:44.165
Not a minute longer.

46:44.166 --> 46:45.267
Deal?

46:45.268 --> 46:46.401
Deal.

48:38.347 --> 48:40.052

48:43.052 --> 48:44.151
Hey, babe.

48:44.152 --> 48:46.988
Are they okay?

48:46.989 --> 48:50.058
David is getting an x-ray
and your dad's in surgery.

48:50.059 --> 48:52.361
What happened?

48:52.362 --> 48:56.364
A truck went over the median or something and hit the car.

48:56.365 --> 48:57.732
They were right... Hi.

48:57.733 --> 48:59.600
Now, your son's
x-rays look good.

48:59.601 --> 49:01.303
Uh, he's got a
slight concussion

49:01.304 --> 49:03.671
but we're optimistic
he'll make a full recovery.

49:03.672 --> 49:05.473

How are you, Ma?

51:46.434 --> 51:47.938
Well, you know...

51:48.938 --> 51:51.172
I keep saying to people,

51:51.173 --> 51:52.175
I'm fine.

51:54.744 --> 51:55.646
But you know,

51:56.646 --> 51:58.447
truth be told,

51:59.447 --> 52:01.918
it all feels...
I don't know...

52:02.918 --> 52:04.387
Unreal, somehow.

52:05.387 --> 52:06.956
I know, Ma.

52:07.956 --> 52:11.426
I want you to come and
live with Susan and me.

52:11.427 --> 52:13.861
I know Maggie is a lot closer.

52:13.862 --> 52:16.297
Well, what makes you think

52:16.298 --> 52:19.301
that I'm gonna go living
with either one of you?

52:19.302 --> 52:21.569
Because, Ma,
we have a big house.

52:21.570 --> 52:22.971
We have plenty of room.

52:22.972 --> 52:24.942
I know, I know, and...

52:25.942 --> 52:27.378
It's a very generous offer.

52:29.378 --> 52:30.712
I tell you what.

52:30.713 --> 52:32.580
I'll come and stay
for a few weeks

52:32.581 --> 52:35.450
until David is back
to himself again.

52:35.451 --> 52:36.917
- Ma.
- No!

52:36.918 --> 52:38.257
You hold your breath.

52:41.257 --> 52:42.656
You know where you get that

52:42.657 --> 52:44.661
stubborn streak from, don't you?

52:45.661 --> 52:46.561
Yes, I do.

52:52.434 --> 52:54.768
Michael, you know,

52:54.769 --> 52:57.690
your father was
so very proud of you.

53:19.628 --> 53:21.696
How you doing, sir?
Mr. Walker?

53:21.697 --> 53:22.897
Yeah, is there a problem?

53:22.898 --> 53:24.034
Uh, no, sir. Uh...

53:26.034 --> 53:26.994
I'm sorry for your loss.

53:28.336 --> 53:29.638
Thank you.

53:29.639 --> 53:32.040
Anyways, uh, your
father's car was totaled,

53:32.041 --> 53:34.340
but we did find
some personal belongings.

54:04.340 --> 54:05.574
Dad?

54:06.574 --> 54:07.878
What do you need, son?

54:09.878 --> 54:11.199
I thought you were
finally asleep.

54:15.016 --> 54:16.688
When people die

54:19.688 --> 54:21.608
do you think they can still
see you and hear you?

54:27.028 --> 54:28.389
I wish that I could
tell Grandpa...

54:34.369 --> 54:35.942
That I'm sorry.

54:39.942 --> 54:41.646
Sorry for what, son?

54:43.646 --> 54:44.546
It was all my fault.

54:49.452 --> 54:51.092
I didn't wanna drive back
till after dark.

54:53.956 --> 54:56.797
I just wanted to see all the
lights on the house lit up.

55:01.797 --> 55:02.718
David, that's not true.

55:04.467 --> 55:05.570
It was an accident.

55:07.570 --> 55:10.708
You had absolutely
nothing to do with that.

55:12.708 --> 55:14.385
You have to understand
that, okay?

55:23.385 --> 55:26.520
David, welcome home, honey.

55:26.521 --> 55:28.492
Oh, how good that you're here.

55:30.492 --> 55:33.528
Come on in!
You know what?

55:33.529 --> 55:37.098
We might be able to rustle up
some hot chocolate for you.

55:37.099 --> 55:39.667
- How about that?
- That sounds good.

55:39.668 --> 55:41.829
I think he wants some more
of that hospital Jell-O, Ma.

55:45.740 --> 55:46.640
Hey, man.

55:50.445 --> 55:51.913
You're not gonna eat
that mac and cheese?

55:51.914 --> 55:52.954
I know it's your favorite.

55:54.916 --> 55:56.621
I'm just not hungry.

55:58.621 --> 55:59.824
Yeah.

56:05.994 --> 56:07.315
David, I want you
to listen to me.

56:11.065 --> 56:12.902
You are not to blame

56:13.902 --> 56:15.141
for what happened to Grandpa.

56:19.141 --> 56:20.177
The truck that hit you...

56:21.177 --> 56:22.547
The tire blew out.

56:24.547 --> 56:25.787
You had nothing
to do with that.

56:31.654 --> 56:33.757
The driver tried
to keep from swerving.

56:34.757 --> 56:35.657
He couldn't.

56:39.228 --> 56:41.498
I think I'm tired now, Dad.

56:43.498 --> 56:44.398
Hey, hey.

56:46.001 --> 56:47.739
Listen to me.

56:50.739 --> 56:53.875
That highway should have
had a center barrier, man.

56:53.876 --> 56:56.581
It didn't.
It was an accident.

56:58.581 --> 57:00.655
Nothing was your fault.

57:07.655 --> 57:09.960
Hey, you know
what this house needs?

57:10.960 --> 57:13.560
Christmas lights.

57:13.561 --> 57:14.796
How about you take a couple
of bites of mac and cheese...

57:14.797 --> 57:15.697
No.

57:18.099 --> 57:20.234
Dude, we've got this big giant
Christmas tree out back.

57:20.235 --> 57:22.842
- You know how great...
- No.

57:27.842 --> 57:28.742
You were right, Dad.

57:32.248 --> 57:33.757
Christmas is stupid.

58:03.177 --> 58:04.215
What in the world?

58:06.215 --> 58:07.614
Michael?

58:23.231 --> 58:25.735
David hates Christmas now.

58:27.735 --> 58:29.415
He blames himself
for what happened to Pop.

58:37.211 --> 58:39.279
- I know.
- I told him it was an accident.

58:39.280 --> 58:40.849
It couldn't have
been his fault.

58:41.849 --> 58:43.685
I explained it to him.

58:43.686 --> 58:46.989
I explained it to him
every way I know how.

58:47.989 --> 58:50.758
Well, sometimes that just
isn't enough, is it?

58:52.226 --> 58:53.965
Look at me, Michael.

58:55.965 --> 58:57.867
You remember
all those years ago

58:58.867 --> 58:59.767
after it happened,

59:01.603 --> 59:03.937
you remember what your
father said to you?

59:03.938 --> 59:06.140
Morning, noon, and night

59:06.141 --> 59:08.261
for months on end, you remember
what your father said?

59:11.012 --> 59:12.252
"Michael, it wasn't
your fault."

59:17.052 --> 59:18.925
He only said that
'cause he had to.

59:22.925 --> 59:24.760
Oh, Michael.

59:25.760 --> 59:27.097
You're a smart man.

59:29.097 --> 59:30.765
Who was it who gave you

59:30.766 --> 59:32.127
and your brother
those skates? Hmm?

59:38.039 --> 59:39.043
Right.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.399
Hey, Ray.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.903
Howdy, Nick. I haven't seen
you in here since breakfast.

01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:05.171
- Give us some of everything.
- All right.

01:04:05.172 --> 01:04:06.540
You know, Nick, I'm
really not that hungry.

01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:08.509
I should probably
be heading home.

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:11.444
What's that? You say
you're not hungry?

01:04:11.445 --> 01:04:13.965
Oh, come on, Michael. For once in
your life have a little faith!

01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:22.163
- Wow!

01:04:28.163 --> 01:04:29.397

01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:48.181
Hey, Dale.
Thanks, maybe later.

01:04:48.182 --> 01:04:49.283
Okay, I gotcha.

01:04:49.284 --> 01:04:50.286
Let's take a break, boys.

01:04:52.286 --> 01:04:53.607
I thought we had
an understanding.

01:04:55.123 --> 01:04:56.589
What do you mean?

01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:59.195
You promised not to paint
the house pink, remember?

01:05:00.195 --> 01:05:01.398
Paint the house pink?

01:05:04.398 --> 01:05:05.732
Christmas lights.

01:05:05.733 --> 01:05:07.003
Not a one.

01:05:08.003 --> 01:05:11.105
It's not really living up to the
neighborhood standards, now.

01:05:11.106 --> 01:05:13.073
Can I ask you a question?

01:05:13.074 --> 01:05:15.042
Does this really
make sense to you?

01:05:15.043 --> 01:05:17.444
People celebrating
the birth of Jesus

01:05:17.445 --> 01:05:20.615
by seeing how many lights that
they can cram onto their houses?

01:05:21.615 --> 01:05:24.218
Come on, man. I mean,

01:05:24.219 --> 01:05:26.153
doesn't that sound
like a bunch of...

01:05:26.154 --> 01:05:27.087
Horse hockey? Yeah.

01:05:27.088 --> 01:05:28.189
Horse hockey.

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.422
Maybe it is

01:05:29.423 --> 01:05:30.323
a lot of horse hockey.

01:05:31.025 --> 01:05:32.727
I guess it depends
on the way you look at it.

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:34.289
Well, how else
are you gonna look at it?

01:05:34.596 --> 01:05:35.496
Um, well...

01:05:37.132 --> 01:05:38.335
What ties a family together?

01:05:40.335 --> 01:05:44.337
It's not the blood. It's not
having the same last name.

01:05:44.338 --> 01:05:46.073
It's the memories.

01:05:46.074 --> 01:05:48.341
Well I have plenty
of bad memories.

01:05:48.342 --> 01:05:51.345
Well there's nothing
you can do about those.

01:05:51.346 --> 01:05:53.086
But you do have a say-so
over the good ones.

No, no, please.

01:06:53.507 --> 01:06:55.076

01:06:56.811 --> 01:06:59.446

was a box of Christmas lights.

01:07:27.442 --> 01:07:28.342
You sure about that?

01:07:30.277 --> 01:07:31.686

You know, I don't think

01:15:54.815 --> 01:15:57.297
there's really any explaining
his behavior today.

01:17:08.989 --> 01:17:10.395
Are you still

What are you looking at?

01:18:08.483 --> 01:18:10.317
Burp, Snort and Poot.

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:11.827
Couldn't do it without them.

01:18:19.827 --> 01:18:21.894
You know, I learned something

01:18:21.895 --> 01:18:24.100
pretty cool from
your grandpa yesterday.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:27.802
Yesterday?

01:18:28.802 --> 01:18:30.403
Yeah.

01:18:30.404 --> 01:18:32.106
I was blaming myself.

01:18:33.106 --> 01:18:35.908
I was blaming Christmas.

01:18:35.909 --> 01:18:37.470
That's about the worst
thing I could do.

01:18:39.279 --> 01:18:40.239
Grandpa loved Christmas.

01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:43.855
So did your Uncle David.

01:18:48.855 --> 01:18:50.859
Remember you were laying
in bed in the hospital

01:18:51.859 --> 01:18:53.993
and you asked me,

01:18:53.994 --> 01:18:58.935
"Do you think people can still
see us after they die?"

01:19:00.935 --> 01:19:02.070
Yeah.

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:05.880
I think they can.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.949
So let's make it
worth their while.

01:19:15.949 --> 01:19:16.849
Ready?

01:19:29.063 --> 01:19:30.563
Wow, Dad.

01:19:30.564 --> 01:19:32.898

lights up this year.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.554

01:19:54.555 --> 01:19:56.288

01:20:12.006 --> 01:20:14.606
Thanks a lot, Michael, now we gotta
get more lights for our house!

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:18.111
I think you'll manage, Griff.
You'll find some.

01:20:18.112 --> 01:20:20.072

That's very cool.

01:20:48.975 --> 01:20:50.577
It's awesome. Mmm-hmm.

01:20:50.578 --> 01:20:52.018
Maybe we can play
something together.

01:20:52.145 --> 01:20:54.281
Maybe.

01:20:54.282 --> 01:20:56.148
Let me just learn how to play guitar.

01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:58.550
Yeah, I'm working' on this myself.
Then, we can play.
