00:46.647 --> 00:47.647
Hey, thanks, man.

00:50.918 --> 00:51.819
You okay, buddy?

00:51.820 --> 00:53.553
I'm okay, I'm okay.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.722
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

00:55.723 --> 00:56.723
Okay.

01:03.931 --> 01:06.166
Oh, I'm so happy to hear that.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.800
Okay.

01:07.801 --> 01:11.372
Yeah, working with
Andrew Walsh was great,
it was smooth and...

01:13.741 --> 01:17.477
Okay, yeah, just give him
a call and, um...

01:17.478 --> 01:19.146
we'll take it from there.

01:19.147 --> 01:21.148
Thank you.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.549
Fuck!

01:22.550 --> 01:23.550
Dude.

01:25.018 --> 01:28.288
Oh, my God,
I've missed you so much.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.989
Ditto.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.691
Why are you screaming "fuck"?

01:31.692 --> 01:35.362
Oh, I was just, like,
this close to getting
a sub gig in Houston,

01:35.363 --> 01:38.665
but it turns out that
Andrew Walsh just, like,
knows everyone, so...

01:38.666 --> 01:41.601
So you're secretly stoked
you won't have to
mess with Texas?

01:41.602 --> 01:44.471
I appreciate you.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.038
What's up with the outfit?

01:46.039 --> 01:49.276
So I got really into
this 1930s Czech composer

01:49.277 --> 01:50.777
named Vítêzslava Kaprálová.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.079
She happens to look
exactly like me.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.448
I started singing
some of her songs
and they're...

01:55.449 --> 01:57.184
They really got to me, so, yeah,

01:57.185 --> 01:58.285
I'm dressing like her now.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.386
Of course you are.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.753
Yeah.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.190
Oh, my God.
And I bought, um,
a dive bar...

02:03.191 --> 02:04.857
- What?
- With the rest of
my uncle's money, yeah.

02:04.858 --> 02:08.094
And I'm turning it into
a 1930s Czech speak easy.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.229
- So, you're a bar owner.
- Yeah.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.999
And now you're dressing like
a dead Czech lady.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.033
Yeah.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.436
How long have I been gone?

02:16.237 --> 02:19.206
This is the one.

02:19.207 --> 02:24.211
Sublet, sweet sub...
Hello.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.613
Are you Shawn?

02:26.614 --> 02:30.683
Oh. Sebastian said, um...
Well, I thought that

02:30.684 --> 02:32.285
you were gonna be in Prague.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.987
Uh, Prague didn't happen.
Come in, come in.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.256
Okay.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.225
He told me not to come,
but it's fine.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.059
It'll be great to have
someone to talk to.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.328
Welcome to the Ferndale.

02:41.329 --> 02:44.231
So this is the gallery space.

02:44.232 --> 02:47.901
And this is
the performance space.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.137
Wow.

02:51.138 --> 02:54.307
And...

02:54.308 --> 02:56.142
do you notice any resemblance?

02:56.143 --> 02:58.144
Yeah.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.280
She was, like, 25 when she died.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.948
Oh.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.750
How much shit she wrote.

03:03.751 --> 03:06.052
Orchestral suites,
Czech art songs.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.154
I would love you
to do something
for the opening,

03:08.155 --> 03:09.289
some oboe piece or something.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.523
Yeah. Maybe.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.325
This is...
Where is it?

03:12.326 --> 03:14.994
This is the one
that I'm working on.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.001
I guess everyone knows now.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.804
Well, I think that's
the least of your worries,
darling.

03:57.805 --> 04:01.541
Ha. I'm just going to keep
a smile on my face,

04:01.542 --> 04:02.809
and everything will be fine.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.477
Good, that's what you always do.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.579
- Maestro.
- Bob. How are you?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.014
- Great, sir. How are you?
- Wonderful to see you.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.683
- Maestro, welcome.
- Oh, how nice to see you.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.218
Did you have a good summer,
everyone?

04:12.219 --> 04:14.220
Oh, it was a little slow.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.455
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.956
- Are the happy couple...
- Thomas.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.225
Listen, I think we're gonna
get this settled.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.428
Thomas.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.063
Yes, darling, coming.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.632
- Hello.
- Tanya: Hey.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.166
- Hailey.
- Hi.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.535
- Welcome home.
- Oh, thank you.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.069
Is the Maestro coming?

04:30.070 --> 04:33.573
Uh, no, he just
kind of disappeared
after the concert.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.708
What's his thinking
about the lock out?
Is he gonna help us?

04:35.709 --> 04:39.012
Uh, hi.
Um, I don't know.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.851
Nice to see you guys, too.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.892
Dee Dee.
I had no idea.

04:52.893 --> 04:58.531
Pastor Dee Dee of
the online Church of
the Collective Creator.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.433
- Nice bangs.
- Thank you.

05:00.434 --> 05:03.069
And look who's back from Hawaii.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.872
Oh, what was it like
playing with
the Honolulu Phil?

05:05.873 --> 05:08.608
- Dreamy. Hey, kid.
- Hi.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.978
Oh, great cameo. Loved you
flailing around on stage.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.515
- You saw that?
- The whole world did,
sweetie.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.485
Where are you going?

05:18.486 --> 05:20.387
Back in a second.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.389
- Betty.
- Darling.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.391
Missed you.
Missed you too much.

05:24.392 --> 05:28.661
Ohh, precious.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.631
Aloha, sweet baby.

05:31.632 --> 05:34.767
- Do you want to hold him?
- Oh, fuck, no.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.537
Management on one side,
us on the other.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.738
I see nothing's changed.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.907
The bird is ready to fly.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.776
Treat her well. Okay?
That's all I ask.

05:43.777 --> 05:47.146
What? It's supposed to be
a coded conversation.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.616
- I say the bird's
ready to fly, you say...
- The bird...

05:49.617 --> 05:51.017
- Falcon.
- Falcon, yes.

05:51.018 --> 05:54.421
Not bird, falcon.
The falcon has left
the nest.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.022
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.258
Um, and yes. Of course,
I'll treat her well,

05:59.259 --> 06:01.928
not that it's
any of your business.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.431
Maestro. Love that
eraseface song.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.899
Welcome to earth, motherfuckers.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.034
Number one in Korea.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.136
Hey, look.
The godfather's
in the house.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.438
Hey.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.272
- Come on down, Maestro.
- How are you, man.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.141
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you as well.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.009
- Hai Lai.
- Hey.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.578
We have to talk, eh?
We have to talk.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.513
Yes. Hey.
Hey. Hello. Hi.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.781
Maestro, Maestro,

06:21.782 --> 06:23.650
we're planning a
solidarity concert.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.552
- Will you join us?
- Vivalio. Vivaldi.
Oh, I like this. Hey.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.319
Thank you for coming back.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.755
- Thank you for
coming back, Maestro.
- No problem.

06:28.756 --> 06:29.956
Your old room is waiting.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.324
Actually, he's bunking
with me, so...

06:32.325 --> 06:33.660
- An interesting idea.
- You are?

06:33.661 --> 06:35.361
Yes, the... Where...
Where's the baby?

06:35.362 --> 06:38.130
Where's the Ba...
Oh, hey, the baby.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.832
Yes, of course.
Yay!

06:39.833 --> 06:41.934
Hey, how are you?
Okay? Yes? Good.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.870
- Here's your goddaughter.
- Thank you very much.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.772
Thank you.
Yes, please.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.474
Oh, yes, I have her.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.475
- All right.
- Yes. Hey.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.176
Okay. Wow,
she's grown so much.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.245
- Yeah.
- Wow. Okay. Well, everyone,

06:53.246 --> 06:55.682
Artists, management,
welcome, welcome.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.183
Sit down. Take a seat,
take a seat, take a seat.

06:57.184 --> 07:00.553
Let's do this. Okay,
we are gathered here today

07:00.554 --> 07:03.823
for this beautiful Olivia.
Hm? Yes?

07:03.824 --> 07:08.495
Who, eh... Oh!
We're also gathered here today
for the beautiful parents,

07:08.496 --> 07:11.263
Virgil, who works with
the numbers,

07:11.264 --> 07:13.099
and Christophe,
who works with the violin.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.868
They are both
the most important
for this baby.

07:15.869 --> 07:19.872
Olivia, she comes to
the world as a new song.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.709
You know?
Played for the first time.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.011
She's like music.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.514
Every time she cries,
or she laughs,

07:27.515 --> 07:32.051
she takes us to a place that
we don't know the name of.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.954
Christophe, can you hold her
by the feet, please?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.589
- Sure.
- Yes, yes.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.526
And Virgil, can you
hold her by the hands?

07:39.527 --> 07:41.127
- Oh, yeah.
- Please. Yeah?

07:41.128 --> 07:43.262
You have the baby?
You have the baby
in your hands?

07:43.263 --> 07:44.997
Now pull her apart!

07:44.998 --> 07:47.066
- Oh.
- Tear her into two pieces.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.801
'Cause that's what you've
all done with music!

07:48.802 --> 07:50.803
What the hell is he doing
with my granddaughter?

07:50.804 --> 07:52.171
No, don't worry,
don't worry, Grandfather.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.640
Don't worry.
They won't hurt her.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.007
Because they love her.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.809
You don't hurt the thing
you love most. Right?

07:56.810 --> 07:57.977
You're damn right there,
Maestro!

07:57.978 --> 08:00.046
Thank you, Maestro, thank you.

08:00.047 --> 08:03.015
And I'm sorry
I abandoned you all.
I'm sorry I left you.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.817
I went away.
I went away because

08:04.818 --> 08:08.354
I couldn't put myself to
conduct this horrendous score,

08:08.355 --> 08:11.223
the symphony of red tape.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.126
I think we all understand
and appreciate the message.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.095
Certainly, but it's more
complicated than that.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.631
It's simple, it's simple.
I'll make it very simple.

08:18.632 --> 08:22.268
In this place, in this church
today, right now,

08:22.269 --> 08:26.806
with this amazing priest
and this beautiful baby,

08:26.807 --> 08:29.942
we will solve the lock out
with a locking you in.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.243
What's he talking about?

08:31.244 --> 08:32.979
- Yes.
- I never really know.

08:32.980 --> 08:36.048
If you don't make a deal
by today...

08:36.049 --> 08:37.616
- I quit.
- No, please don't.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.085
- Please, please don't.
- Yes, I quit. I quit.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.754
I... Ciao, Rodrigo,
ciao, ciao, ciao, yes.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.256
But, if you do reach a deal,

08:44.256 --> 08:46.726
then you have me.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.961
For whatever you want.
You know?

08:48.962 --> 08:51.231
As long as you want.
Okay?

08:57.204 --> 09:01.040
Right. Everyone,
friends of the family
and family themselves.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.642
Please, if you wouldn't mind

09:02.643 --> 09:05.945
following Pavel
out to the courtyard,

09:05.946 --> 09:09.315
where we have prepared
a beautiful buffet.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.482
And martinis for you all.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.118
Well, what about the ceremony?

09:12.119 --> 09:13.485
- Oh...
- Mother of Virgil,
don't worry.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.021
Don't... No, no,
because,

09:15.022 --> 09:16.989
I mean, we can't have
the christening in this...

09:16.990 --> 09:20.727
In this atmosphere of
hate and division, can we?

09:20.728 --> 09:22.261
I think you're right, Maestro.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.464
Good, then.
Members of the orchestra
and management,

09:25.465 --> 09:27.066
please stay here.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.969
Everyone else, come on,
let's clear the church
right now.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.137
- Rodrigo...
- Let's go, everyone.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.139
Rodrigo, there are
no lawyers here.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.074
I don't know how we can
continue and make this...

09:35.075 --> 09:36.976
She's right, she's right,
it doesn't work like this.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.711
You see, you both
are agreeing already.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.446
That's fantastic.
That's a great start.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.948
So you're in on this.

09:41.949 --> 09:45.551
I'm sick and tired of
this lock out bullshit.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.086
Nonetheless,
both of you maestros

09:47.087 --> 09:49.088
understand
what the problem is...

09:49.089 --> 09:52.759
The problem is money.
Money, money, money,
it's always money, right?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.961
Yes. So, you know what,
for the pot,

09:54.962 --> 09:57.329
I will add
all my earnings I did
in the Venice concerto.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.998
And I made a lot of money
for that.

09:58.999 --> 10:03.970
I will cut my fee to
half of whatever Pavel makes.

10:03.971 --> 10:07.606
Do... Do you know how much
Pavel makes?

10:07.607 --> 10:10.677
No.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.112
After tax.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.048
- Wow.
- Yeah.

10:16.049 --> 10:19.485
Oh. Okay, well,
we'll manage, we'll manage.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.020
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.222
If you excuse me,
I have to leave now.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.692
- I'm gonna watch a show.
- Where are you going?

10:25.693 --> 10:27.459
I'm gonna see a show.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.428
A bubble show.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.930
You can't leave us here.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.832
You have your mission,
I have mine.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.767
- Ciao, Rodrigo.
- Wait.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.135
I need you to
help me out with this.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.237
I'm not even really
in the orchestra.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.172
- We have to talk,
you and I...
- Rodrigo.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.341
- We have to talk.
All right? We'll talk.
- Rodrigo. Come on.

10:42.342 --> 10:45.177
We'll talk later.
I'm sorry, Hai Lai.
I'm sorry.

10:45.178 --> 10:48.180
I'm sorry but it had to be done.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.784
- It's locked.
- Yes,
I just said that.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.721
- You ready?
- I'm ready to step down.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.989
- What? Why?
- She and I won't get there.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.391
It's too personal.
It can't be me leading this.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.894
We need someone smart,
aggressive, conniving.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.595
Fine. I'll do it.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.065
- Bob, sorry, no.
- What?

11:06.066 --> 11:08.035
Betty.
Hey, Betty.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.437
Betty.

11:11.438 --> 11:12.839
Okey dokey.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.840
I'm on it.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.649
Windsor.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.457
Betty.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.771
I never really hung out
in church much.

11:44.772 --> 11:49.408
I hear there's supposed
to be wine somewhere.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.409
Uh-huh.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.186
So at first, he was
my meditation teacher,

12:00.187 --> 12:03.857
but then we just wound up
having a lot of sex.

12:05.025 --> 12:08.627
Ooh, my kind of priest.
Cups?

12:08.628 --> 12:10.629
Will these do?

12:10.630 --> 12:13.465
Honey, I could drink
out of a shoe.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.968
Bring 'em here.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.469
Okay, first thing
we have to do is

12:17.470 --> 12:18.938
we gotta call
the reception place,
and we gotta cancel.

12:18.939 --> 12:22.208
Can we just try to be
Zen about this?

12:22.209 --> 12:24.243
I'm sorry,
I think I'm being
quite Zen right now.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.145
- I think you're panicking.
- I'm not... I'm not panicking.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.615
I'm... I'm being functional,
I'm trying to help out with...

12:29.616 --> 12:33.385
Hey! It's Polka time!

12:36.423 --> 12:38.157
Pavel.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.992
Can you do something about this?

12:39.993 --> 12:42.528
- No, I'm not...
- Can you do something
about this?

13:32.279 --> 13:35.547
- No, no, no. Keep going.
- No, that's okay.

13:35.548 --> 13:39.351
Just something that was
buzzing around my head
in Venice, you know.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.520
Oh, it...
It doesn't matter.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.690
Hey, um...

13:44.691 --> 13:49.896
I just wanted to...
to thank you for stepping in...

13:49.897 --> 13:51.130
with the orchestra.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.999
I was clearly in over my head.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.103
Oh. That's fine.
My pleasure.

13:57.104 --> 14:00.272
You know, I'm...
I'm half embarrassed
to say this, but...

14:00.273 --> 14:02.808
I once pissed my pants

14:02.809 --> 14:05.044
conducting a full
orchestra rehearsal.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.178
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.047
Of course,
I was drunk at the time.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.249
Out of my mind on coke.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.719
And I leaned over to
the first viola player,

14:13.720 --> 14:16.322
beautiful girl that
I was running around with
at the time,

14:16.323 --> 14:18.457
and without missing a down beat,

14:18.458 --> 14:19.591
I whispered to her,

14:19.592 --> 14:22.161
"I've pissed my pants,
haven't I, darling?"

14:22.162 --> 14:24.430
And she whispered back,

14:24.431 --> 14:27.366
"Maestro, you're not
wearing any pants."

14:29.336 --> 14:31.303
I suppose the moral
of that one is,

14:31.304 --> 14:33.940
we have to celebrate
our failures.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.308
Yeah.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.645
Maybe I'll
piss myself one day
in second chair.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.780
Oh, now, come on.

14:41.781 --> 14:44.283
Are we supposed to
feel sorry for you
or something,

14:44.284 --> 14:48.120
or you think you're gonna be
handed the baton?

14:48.121 --> 14:50.489
And told, "Woo, look here,
she's a genius."

14:50.490 --> 14:53.059
No, that's not
what I was looking for.

14:53.060 --> 14:57.063
- I...
- You know, from what
I've noticed,

14:57.064 --> 15:00.066
you're a half decent
oboe player.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.333
And that's the story.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.302
Maestro, with all due respect,

15:03.303 --> 15:05.137
I've just been doing
what my conductors

15:05.138 --> 15:06.738
have been telling me
I should do,

15:06.739 --> 15:09.775
which is basically
be their assistant
or be fired,

15:09.776 --> 15:11.877
so...

15:11.878 --> 15:13.245
Are you going to accept that,

15:13.246 --> 15:17.016
or do you have something to say?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.986
Can you help me?

15:19.886 --> 15:21.520
So that's an impasse.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.456
Then prost.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.198
- Ah.
- Ugh.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.000
You're a tough negotiator.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.235
Well, I've been through
four divorces.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.204
Well, I've broken off
three engagements.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.838
So I guess we're just
two fucked up broads

15:39.839 --> 15:42.008
who are never gonna find
a solution to any of this.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.776
Shall we try again?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.246
Three... percent
on pension.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.615
Three and a quarter.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.251
You really want to have
another toast?

15:52.252 --> 15:53.252
Fine.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.026
Okay.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.033
I heard you.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.536
Hello?

16:10.537 --> 16:12.038
Hello.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.573
How'd you get in here?

16:14.574 --> 16:15.807
I know everything.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.610
All the little
secret passages
in this building.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.379
I know it.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.482
How can I help you,
Mr. DeSousa?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.717
The New York Symphony Orchestra.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.886
My family.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.588
We need our home.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.658
- No go.
- No go?

16:32.659 --> 16:36.928
Those are very big...
two little words, no go.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.264
I have a family, too.

16:38.265 --> 16:41.067
If your family moves in,

16:41.068 --> 16:42.501
my family moves out.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.637
That breaks my heart
because it's two families.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.906
No?
And two parents.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.342
Both of our families
need a home.

16:50.343 --> 16:55.281
How can we put
two bubbles in one?

16:55.282 --> 16:57.316
You know, like,
put the music bubble

16:57.317 --> 17:01.153
inside the bubble
of the bubbles.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.688
Know what I'm talking about?

17:02.689 --> 17:05.357
Okay, let me show you,
let me show you.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.393
One bubble inside
the other, you know?

17:07.394 --> 17:10.096
One is music,
and the other is the
bubble of bubbles.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.696
Okay... Uh, no.
Okay, wait.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.464
Wait a minute.
It's about to be there.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.367
Okay. No.
There, you see?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.469
But they don't exist
within each other.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.838
Like this?

17:19.839 --> 17:24.810
Melody.
How did you do that?

17:24.810 --> 17:29.248
That's incredible.
Wow!

17:29.249 --> 17:31.450
Melody, that...

17:31.451 --> 17:33.185
That's impressive, yes, exactly.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.122
That's even beyond
what I imagined.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.224
Which one is the music?

17:38.225 --> 17:42.394
Okay. Melody,
the bubble can hold us both.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.631
Maybe you can rehearse
during the day.

17:45.632 --> 17:48.334
We'll just need the stage
every night.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.736
And one more thing.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.204
Bubbles are not empty.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.673
They're filled with everything.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.609
35... 36.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.077
I'm okay with
those insurance cuts

19:06.078 --> 19:07.413
if you contribute to dental.

19:07.414 --> 19:10.382
Look at these numbers,
they're terrifying.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.918
We're toxic to donors,
we're toxic.

19:15.288 --> 19:20.892
I'm giving you
everything you need.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.894
But...

19:22.895 --> 19:25.497
I still think we may be
dead in the water.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.833
You know why I broke up
those engagements?

19:27.834 --> 19:33.439
Because for 35 years,
this orchestra has been
my husband, my kids.

19:33.440 --> 19:37.443
I missed vacations,
holidays, weddings,
funerals.

19:37.444 --> 19:41.813
I never traveled anyplace
that my oboe didn't take me.

19:41.814 --> 19:45.484
I love this fucked up orchestra.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.886
I'd take a bullet for it.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.522
That's what I'm offering.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.823
You want me to shoot you?

19:51.824 --> 19:55.228
I want you to listen to
what I have to say.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.198
It feels strange not to be
in there with them.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.101
You know what you need?

20:03.102 --> 20:08.073
When was the last time
you did something really fun?

20:08.074 --> 20:11.977
I honestly have no idea.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.714
Well, maybe if, um...

20:15.915 --> 20:17.549
If we get out of here
tonight, I could...

20:17.550 --> 20:20.719
You know, that looks like fun.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.256
I was thinking more...
No, but okay.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.263
Okay, uh... Yeah.

20:31.264 --> 20:34.199
Sorry.
Could you actually
just bring out

20:34.200 --> 20:37.168
the A in the tenth measure?

20:37.169 --> 20:38.470
Bring it out?

20:38.471 --> 20:40.606
Oh, yes, sorry.
Um...

20:40.607 --> 20:43.074
Oh, please, please.
Ugh. Don't do that.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.176
- What?
- Um, well...

20:45.177 --> 20:48.447
You know, you have to
command the room.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.783
And when you were in Venice,
I noticed it was the giggle.

20:51.784 --> 20:55.321
That little giggle,
I think it killed you.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.323
- Sorry.
- Uh!

20:57.324 --> 20:58.490
You're being too nice.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.626
Okay, I disagree,
because I don't think

21:00.627 --> 21:03.128
that you have to be a dick
to be a great artist.

21:03.129 --> 21:06.632
By all means,
you can be pleasant,

21:06.633 --> 21:10.469
but your players
want to be told what to do.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.070
Okay, I get it.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.906
- Okay.
- All right,
from the same spot.

21:14.907 --> 21:15.907
Mm-hm.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.348
Faster.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.350
Okay, let it go.
Let it go.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.051
- Yell it.
- Faster!

21:26.052 --> 21:27.953
Yell it.
Let it go!

21:27.954 --> 21:29.187
Faster, you dumbass!

21:29.188 --> 21:31.490
Hey! Come on!
This is shouting!

21:31.491 --> 21:33.224
Shout! Shout!
Come on!

21:33.225 --> 21:35.060
Faster, dumbass!

21:35.061 --> 21:37.228
Faster, you dumbass!

21:37.229 --> 21:39.432
No giggling!

21:41.167 --> 21:43.402
All right.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.571
Now, stop asking for permission.

21:45.572 --> 21:48.139
Get yourself some musicians,

21:48.140 --> 21:49.975
a piece of music,

21:49.976 --> 21:51.910
and just conduct.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.979
Okay?
And if you do,

21:53.980 --> 21:56.382
I'll come and see you.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.922
We did it!

22:07.159 --> 22:08.927
- We did it!
- Yeah!

22:08.928 --> 22:11.763
Just one.

22:11.764 --> 22:12.764
Oh, yeah.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.414
Over the next five years,

22:28.415 --> 22:31.149
management will increase
cost of living

22:31.150 --> 22:33.952
1.5 percent per year.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.988
- What happened to two?
- Nice one, Betty.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.458
Hey. Get over here
and read this one,

22:39.459 --> 22:40.893
you tall freak of nature.

22:43.062 --> 22:46.632
"The number of tenured
players will be sunset

22:46.633 --> 22:47.799
"in the coming year."
What does that mean?

22:47.800 --> 22:49.435
It means I'm gonna retire.

22:49.436 --> 22:52.938
- What, Betty?
- Boohoo, I know, I know.
You'll get over it.

22:52.939 --> 22:55.941
Three of us are gonna
have to step down to
make all of this work.

22:55.942 --> 22:59.210
- Wait, what? Who?
- We need to figure that out.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.680
But, as part of the agreement,

23:01.681 --> 23:03.582
Betty is moving on to represent

23:03.583 --> 23:05.751
the players' interests
on the board.

23:05.752 --> 23:08.319
Yes! You guys did it!

23:08.320 --> 23:10.556
Yes!

23:14.827 --> 23:16.327
- Yes!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

23:16.328 --> 23:18.597
we're still working out
the details,

23:18.598 --> 23:19.965
and we still have to call votes,

23:19.966 --> 23:22.000
but... but we're headed in
the right direction.

23:22.001 --> 23:25.505
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

23:36.282 --> 23:38.550
Where are we gonna perform?

23:41.754 --> 23:44.756
Guys, I just got
a really brilliant idea.
