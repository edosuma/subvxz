00:00.752 --> 00:02.295
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.504 --> 00:05.382
<i>I need everything
you can tell me about
Mr. Boss' crime organization.</i>

00:05.590 --> 00:07.884
<i>The media's calling you
the Chaos Killer.</i>

00:08.093 --> 00:10.011
The vic who went
missing in Seward Park...

00:10.220 --> 00:12.138
<i>We just learned that his pooch
had one of those
GPS tracking devices.</i>

00:12.347 --> 00:14.349
This man is dying,
and your first thought
is to bring him here?

00:14.557 --> 00:17.018
He's the only person who knows
where to find tainted Utopium.

00:17.227 --> 00:19.604
I can't make the cure without
more tainted Utopium.

00:19.813 --> 00:21.481
I guess I should thank you
for saving my life.

00:21.690 --> 00:24.567
We have two bodies
packed full of tainted Utopium

00:24.776 --> 00:26.444
<i>buried in a shallow grave.</i>

00:26.653 --> 00:28.947
<i>We can narrow
the location to
a single 100 acre field.</i>

00:29.155 --> 00:30.699
John Deaux?
I'm agent Dale Bozzio.

00:30.907 --> 00:33.076
- Who's this?
- Suspect in the
Meat Cute Massacre.

00:33.284 --> 00:34.953
I just met him.
This is our guy!

00:41.626 --> 00:42.794
Can I help you?

00:43.003 --> 00:45.005
I'm just using the computers.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.631
Do you need
the Wi-Fi password?

00:46.840 --> 00:48.967
What have I told you? Out.

00:49.175 --> 00:51.261
- For real? Come on...
- Do I need to call security?

00:51.469 --> 00:52.429
Go.

00:54.723 --> 00:55.932
Bitch.

00:58.351 --> 01:00.395
- Porn?
- Snuff films.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.981
You're not leaving
all that shelving

01:03.189 --> 01:05.525
for me to do again, are you?

01:05.734 --> 01:10.155
I'm so sorry,
I'm just not
feeling too great.

01:10.363 --> 01:12.032
Would it be
awful if I left early?

01:12.240 --> 01:13.283
Fine.

01:13.992 --> 01:14.993
Thank you.

01:35.972 --> 01:37.057
Hey! Stop that!

01:37.265 --> 01:39.434
Get down from there!

01:39.642 --> 01:42.062
I'm calling the police!

01:42.270 --> 01:45.315
That kid was trying
to tip the shelves
on to you, I think.

01:45.523 --> 01:47.358
He what?

01:47.567 --> 01:49.277
Uh... Please cover your mouth!

01:49.486 --> 01:50.820
Oh, my!

01:53.990 --> 01:55.533
Oh...

02:00.830 --> 02:02.332
Oh!

02:27.273 --> 02:28.441
Meet Grace LeGare.

02:28.650 --> 02:30.318
Victim of hemlock poisoning.

02:30.527 --> 02:32.779
She was a librarian,
collapsed at work
three days ago.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.365
She's been in hospital since.
Died, obviously.

02:35.573 --> 02:37.742
But doctors couldn't
figure out
the underlying cause.

02:37.951 --> 02:40.537
She's 30
and otherwise healthy.
Makes no sense.

02:40.745 --> 02:42.831
So they send her to us.

02:43.039 --> 02:45.834
And she might've been
categorized a "respiratory
failure" due to "unknown."

02:46.042 --> 02:47.460
- But...
- But Ravi figured it out

02:47.669 --> 02:49.337
and he's super desperate
for an attaboy.

02:52.799 --> 02:55.176
Attaboy.

02:55.385 --> 02:56.970
All I'm saying is,
a lesser pathologist

02:57.178 --> 02:59.222
might have missed
trace amounts of
stool in her intestines,

02:59.430 --> 03:01.599
which contained trace amounts
of water hemlock.

03:01.808 --> 03:03.393
What do we know about hemlock?

03:03.601 --> 03:04.853
Well, I believe it was
Socrates who
said of hemlock,

03:05.061 --> 03:06.896
"I drank what?"

03:07.105 --> 03:09.941
Claudius kills Hamlet Senior
with a drop of hemlock
in his ear.

03:10.150 --> 03:11.693
Will one of you give me
a hand signal or something

03:11.860 --> 03:13.319
when you're about to
say something useful?

03:15.155 --> 03:17.365
Hemlock is a leafy plant.
Highly lethal.

03:17.574 --> 03:21.161
It can be slipped
into a salad, a tea,
a green smoothie...

03:21.369 --> 03:23.538
In the morning I'll drop in
on the husband, Andy LeGare.

03:23.746 --> 03:25.832
You free?

03:26.040 --> 03:28.042
To see the poor man
hear that his wife didn't
just die, she was murdered?

03:28.251 --> 03:31.171
Seeing his first reaction
to the news will tell us
a lot about him.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.339
Like if he's surprised
we figured it out.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.690
Whoa! Sorry, boys,
no visitors tonight.

03:50.899 --> 03:51.858
Boss' orders.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.776
He's expecting me.

03:53.985 --> 03:55.862
That might be true,
but we got
conflicting stories here.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.615
Because just 10 minutes ago,
he told me
not to let anyone in.

03:58.823 --> 04:01.034
Now, I'd say that request
is, uh, pretty fresh.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.452
Straight out of the oven,
piping hot.

04:03.203 --> 04:04.621
Questions?

04:04.829 --> 04:06.456
Thoughts? Feelings?

04:06.664 --> 04:07.874
I feel like you're a punk-ass
and you better watch yourself.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.918
You know, I'm working on that.

04:10.126 --> 04:12.003
My ex says I put
a wall up in my
interpersonal relationships...

04:12.212 --> 04:14.380
Yo, Mouth, our stash house
got raided tonight again.

04:14.589 --> 04:17.133
Unless Boss is down with
donating 100 G's
worth of product

04:17.342 --> 04:20.637
to the cops on the reg,
he's gonna wanna know there's
a leak in his crew. Move!

04:20.845 --> 04:22.972
I'd be happy to pass
the message along to our man,

04:23.181 --> 04:26.309
but any other options
don't end pretty. Sorry.

04:26.517 --> 04:27.560
Do you know who I am?

04:28.853 --> 04:30.563
A big Danny Trejo fan?

04:30.772 --> 04:31.981
Better do your math, son.

04:32.190 --> 04:33.316
There's three of us
and there's one of you.

04:36.194 --> 04:38.446
You're right.
You're right, man. I'm sorry.

04:38.613 --> 04:39.822
I really should've...

05:15.483 --> 05:16.985
Bad day at school, kiddo?

05:17.193 --> 05:19.862
Yeah, I nearly just got
my ass handed to me.

05:20.071 --> 05:21.614
Boss' guys figured out
there's a rat.

05:21.823 --> 05:23.616
And there's only so much time
before they know it's me.

05:23.825 --> 05:25.535
You keep feeding so much
to the DA,

05:25.743 --> 05:27.078
you're gonna get me killed.

05:27.287 --> 05:29.497
I hear you, man,
I know you're in a tough spot.

05:29.706 --> 05:31.708
But this is us striking
while the iron is hot.

05:31.916 --> 05:35.295
Boss is on the ropes,
can't let up now.

05:35.503 --> 05:40.216
Soon all that was
his will be, um, well, mine.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.557
Would you look at that.
No garden full of wife poison.

05:47.765 --> 05:49.183
There's always the backyard.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.935
Besides, if the hubby wanted
to be smart about it,

05:51.144 --> 05:53.896
he'd grow his hemlock
off the premises.

05:54.105 --> 05:56.733
I've got a good feeling
about this husband.

05:56.941 --> 05:58.693
This news is
going to destroy him.

06:07.160 --> 06:11.622
Mr. LeGare,
I'm Detective Clive Babineaux,
Seattle PD.

06:11.831 --> 06:13.124
Oh, I'm not... I'm Todd.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.667
Andy's home health aide.

06:14.876 --> 06:16.377
Come on in.

06:17.837 --> 06:20.673
Andy, you have visitors.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.928
Hey, uh...

06:26.137 --> 06:27.347
They're from
the police department.

06:28.598 --> 06:30.808
Hi. What's going on?

06:31.017 --> 06:32.560
Mr. LeGare,
I have some bad news.

06:32.769 --> 06:34.645
Someone poisoned your wife.

06:34.854 --> 06:37.190
What are you saying?
Grace was murdered?

06:37.398 --> 06:39.317
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

06:40.151 --> 06:41.527
Oh, God.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.241
You're saying somebody
deliberately poisoned Grace?

06:47.450 --> 06:51.329
With water hemlock.
It's a leafy green plant, it
can easily be snuck into food.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.207
- Are you growing
anything like that, sir?
- No.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.000
No, my gardening days
are behind me.

06:56.209 --> 06:58.211
Todd does everything
except wipe my nose.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.754
That's a great photo.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.589
Thanks.

07:01.798 --> 07:03.800
I'm sorry, can I ask how...

07:04.008 --> 07:06.052
Sure. I was a firefighter.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.762
Five years ago,
I was out on a call,

07:07.970 --> 07:10.181
a support beam collapsed,
flattened me.

07:10.390 --> 07:11.808
Caused a burst fracture
in my L1.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.018
I'm sorry.

07:14.227 --> 07:16.020
- Yeah.
- Mr. LeGare,

07:16.229 --> 07:17.772
is it possible your wife
had enemies?

07:17.980 --> 07:19.440
Enemies? No.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.276
There was a woman at work...

07:22.485 --> 07:24.987
Uh, Muriel.

07:25.196 --> 07:26.572
The librarian
Grace worked with?

07:26.781 --> 07:27.949
Yeah. She was no picnic.

07:28.157 --> 07:30.201
Grace used to complain
about her all the time.

07:30.410 --> 07:32.578
Did she get specific?

07:32.787 --> 07:35.623
She'd look over her
shoulder when she was
using the computers, you know?

07:35.832 --> 07:37.250
Grace used to say the...

07:48.845 --> 07:50.888
Oh, Grace couldn't wait
to get away from Muriel.

07:51.097 --> 07:53.141
As soon as that advance money
came in, she was gonna quit.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.227
I'm sorry... Advance money?

07:56.436 --> 07:57.687
Grace just sold a novel.

07:57.895 --> 07:58.980
Impressive.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.982
She had a dream
and she made it happen.

08:01.190 --> 08:03.818
Major publisher. Book tour.
The whole deal.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.736
Book comes out
in a couple weeks.

08:05.945 --> 08:08.948
Out of curiosity, what kind
of book did Grace write?

08:09.157 --> 08:10.116
Romance.

08:11.451 --> 08:12.660
About this Muriel...

08:12.869 --> 08:13.744
Murdered?

08:13.953 --> 08:15.830
I'm afraid so.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.499
And according
to Grace's husband,
you're the only enemy she had.

08:18.708 --> 08:20.877
Me? He thinks I killed Grace?

08:21.085 --> 08:23.754
I always tried
to be friendly with Andy.

08:23.963 --> 08:25.798
But not Grace.

08:26.007 --> 08:27.550
Grace used work time
inappropriately

08:27.758 --> 08:29.385
and when I caught her,
I'd reprimand her.

08:29.594 --> 08:30.636
Inappropriately how?

08:30.845 --> 08:32.013
She'd work on her book.

08:32.180 --> 08:34.474
And that's frowned on?

08:34.682 --> 08:39.020
I'm a writer too, and
I would never expect taxpayers
to fund my private activities.

08:39.228 --> 08:41.439
Grace was getting
a big advance for her book.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.275
Did that cause friction?

08:44.484 --> 08:45.860
You're asking me
if I was jealous?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.947
You must not know what kind
of book Grace was writing.

08:50.156 --> 08:51.157
A romance novel.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.367
That's one way to describe it.

08:55.536 --> 08:59.999
Ah. This is Grace's
pre-release copy
of her audiobook.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.169
Have a listen.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.088
<i>"The Upright Position,
as read by Kristen Bell.''</i>

09:06.297 --> 09:07.924
I've always felt
a kind of connection to her.

09:12.178 --> 09:14.222
<i>He tore off my scarf,
a savage beast in heat.</i>

09:14.430 --> 09:17.183
<i>"You've been a
bad little bitch,
haven't you?"</i>

09:17.391 --> 09:22.438
<i>My breasts heaved against
the cool, molded plastic
of the airplane's instruments.</i>

09:22.647 --> 09:24.774
<i>He pressed his
maleness against me.</i>

09:24.982 --> 09:29.612
<i>"Sonja," he growled,
husky with passion.</i>

09:29.820 --> 09:33.241
<i>"I'm gonna show you
why they call it a cockpit."</i>

09:40.164 --> 09:42.041
Honey, I'm home.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.502
Oh, good.

09:44.710 --> 09:47.505
Tell me librarian brain
has filled you with an urge
to create order out of chaos.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.423
Our medical files are a mess.

09:52.218 --> 09:54.637
I've been a
bad morgue attendant.

09:54.845 --> 09:57.557
I'll understand if there
are punitive measures.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.518
Liv, did you eat a librarian
from a porno?

10:02.228 --> 10:03.813
I am so sorry.

10:04.021 --> 10:06.274
She wrote erotica and I can
barely keep it in my pants.

10:06.482 --> 10:09.902
Then you think about
something sacred,
like your mum.

10:10.111 --> 10:12.321
Or something gross,
like Margaret Thatcher.

10:12.530 --> 10:14.699
What do American boys
think about?

10:14.907 --> 10:16.701
Baseball, I guess?

10:16.909 --> 10:18.119
Then think about baseball.

10:19.704 --> 10:22.123
Go forth,
direct your lust elsewhere.

10:27.169 --> 10:28.337
Liv.

10:30.965 --> 10:32.049
God help me.

10:32.258 --> 10:33.634
I'm glad you're here.

10:33.843 --> 10:34.677
I would've called but
I don't have your number.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.012
Babe...

10:37.054 --> 10:38.222
Ruth.

10:38.431 --> 10:39.473
You okay?

10:39.682 --> 10:41.225
Sorry, Drake. It's the brains.

10:41.434 --> 10:43.936
You got some time
for a little
zombie-to-zombie advice?

10:45.062 --> 10:46.564
Happy to help. What's up?

10:46.772 --> 10:48.357
You know I'm a bouncer, right?

10:49.275 --> 10:50.359
Yeah, well, uh...

10:50.568 --> 10:51.986
This thing happened
last night.

10:52.194 --> 10:53.738
There was a fight.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.448
I lost control
and I pretty much threw

10:55.656 --> 10:57.575
a rowdy customer
across the parking lot.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.744
- What's that about?
- Drake!

10:59.952 --> 11:01.787
Got time to leave
some blood samples today?

11:01.996 --> 11:03.664
- Yeah, sure.
- Great, let me...

11:03.873 --> 11:04.957
- I'll do it.
- Oh, it's no problem.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.334
I'll do it.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.590
So, losing control,
throwing a guy

11:12.798 --> 11:16.636
across a parking lot,
it sounds like
full-on zombie mode.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.180
Eyes go red.
Adrenaline pumping.

11:19.388 --> 11:22.266
You'll only go full-on
zombie mode when there's

11:22.475 --> 11:24.352
a perceived threat
to survival.

11:26.062 --> 11:27.313
An acute stress...

11:27.521 --> 11:29.065
- An acute stress?
- It's a zombie thing.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.817
It's impossible to control.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.654
Okay,

11:34.862 --> 11:37.615
uh, well, let me ask you a
survival-related question.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.700
- Our buddy Blaine...
- Not my buddy.

11:39.909 --> 11:42.703
Or mine. But he's got me
over a barrel, brain-wise.

11:42.912 --> 11:44.664
He's got me doing
odd jobs for him.

11:44.872 --> 11:45.831
Morgue stuff, mainly.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.500
Body pickups, whatever.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.085
That doesn't sound like fun.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.378
No, it's not.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.129
So, here's the thing...

11:52.338 --> 11:55.675
If I can't deal
with Blaine anymore,
you think I could, um...

11:56.926 --> 11:58.135
Get brains from you?

12:00.262 --> 12:01.722
From here?

12:03.140 --> 12:04.475
I don't really know you.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.478
Oh. No, I totally get it.

12:07.687 --> 12:09.313
I'll make the
Blaine situation work.

12:10.648 --> 12:11.816
But I'd like to know you.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.235
Yeah?

12:15.945 --> 12:17.154
Just say when.

12:22.535 --> 12:25.287
I hate tea.
Burnt water with plants in it.

12:25.496 --> 12:26.956
Some dick took the last K-cup.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.461
I'd throw this on your lap

12:32.670 --> 12:33.713
if I wasn't going
to use it later.

12:35.464 --> 12:37.049
What do we got?

12:37.258 --> 12:38.884
This is the guy you spoke with
at the funeral home, right?

12:39.093 --> 12:40.428
- John Deaux?
- Definitely.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.847
He's the guy
I met at Meat Cute.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.516
But Suzuki didn't write
"John Deaux" on the walls
of Meat Cute in his own blood.

12:45.725 --> 12:47.435
He wrote "Blaine."

12:47.643 --> 12:49.937
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say John Deaux
is an alias.

12:50.146 --> 12:51.355
What did the records say?

12:51.564 --> 12:53.941
Last year, Deaux applied
for a business license.

12:54.108 --> 12:55.943
Before that,
the man didn't exist.

12:56.152 --> 12:59.238
What about school records,
Social, DMV fingerprinting?

12:59.447 --> 13:02.450
All mysteriously unavailable.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.326
Someone's protecting
him here in Seattle.

13:06.996 --> 13:09.248
So we use FBI resources.

13:09.457 --> 13:11.083
Get the mother
of all databases on it.

13:11.292 --> 13:12.668
And then we bust this S.O.B.

13:12.877 --> 13:14.587
And then victory sex.
High five!

13:16.088 --> 13:18.048
Good news on
the Chaos Killer case.

13:18.257 --> 13:21.427
The kidnapped tech guy whose
dog has a GPS tracker?

13:21.635 --> 13:24.054
I got through the red tape,
we're turning the
tracker on tonight.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.182
Oh, let me know when,
I'll ride along.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.476
It's a long shot,
but who knows?

13:28.684 --> 13:30.895
Maybe the dog will lead us
right to the Chaos Killer.

13:31.729 --> 13:32.938
Major Lilywhite.

13:33.147 --> 13:35.483
Who's a pretty boy?

13:35.691 --> 13:37.109
Minor should be ready by 7:00.

13:37.318 --> 13:38.444
You're still at the same
address and phone number?

13:38.652 --> 13:39.695
Yep. You know
where to find me.

13:41.447 --> 13:43.073
Come on, let's go.

13:43.282 --> 13:44.700
Come! Good boy!

13:51.123 --> 13:54.126
Okay. Mmm. Date on Thursday.
Tell me about this guy.

13:55.377 --> 13:56.837
He's got these thick biceps

13:57.046 --> 13:59.465
that stretch the
cottony limits of his T-shirt.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.050
Hmm.

14:01.258 --> 14:04.053
He's got a scar on his face
that speaks of sin.

14:04.261 --> 14:08.390
This is a man who knows when
to take a woman by the
back of her neck and...

14:08.599 --> 14:10.142
Oh!

14:10.351 --> 14:13.979
Sorry. I'm on
horny-librarian-slash-
erotica-novelist brain.

14:14.188 --> 14:15.731
Is your erotica novelist
any good?

14:15.940 --> 14:17.107
I'll read you some.

14:20.528 --> 14:23.781
It's about this porny
flight attendant
who's down for anything.

14:24.657 --> 14:27.034
Grace LeGare...

14:28.744 --> 14:30.329
"Your search did not
match any products?"

14:31.539 --> 14:35.334
<i>Upright Position.</i>

14:35.543 --> 14:38.420
Bingo! Written by
Emmanuelle LeFevre?

14:38.629 --> 14:40.130
Pen name, I guess.

14:40.339 --> 14:43.008
Okay. "'Turn around
and face me,' he orders."

14:43.217 --> 14:44.677
- Hmm.
- "I do what I'm told.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.805
"I know I'm in trouble.
It frightens me,
and thrills me.

14:48.013 --> 14:51.433
"Johnny leers at the
cotton dress clinging
to my hips and breasts.

14:52.351 --> 14:53.561
"He demands..."

14:55.312 --> 14:57.690
You are not going out
dressed like that.

14:57.898 --> 15:01.110
You're gonna put something on
that's not gonna make all
my friends want to nail you.

15:03.529 --> 15:04.655
Oh. Welcome back.

15:04.864 --> 15:05.990
Okay.
I'm pre-ordering this book.

15:06.198 --> 15:07.741
You're not the only one
in a dry spell.

15:10.119 --> 15:13.247
Still not hopping on your
always-the-spouse-bandwagon,

15:13.455 --> 15:15.958
- but Grace's husband, Andy?
- Yeah...

15:16.166 --> 15:17.459
Super possessive.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.420
I had a vision of him
laying into her

15:19.628 --> 15:22.089
for wearing a fairly standard
summer dress.

15:22.298 --> 15:24.884
What are you considering
fairly standard these days?

15:25.092 --> 15:28.262
A good man admires
his wife's beauty,
he doesn't slut shame her.

15:28.470 --> 15:31.265
Speaking of "good men,"
I did a background on him.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.725
You know how he ended up
in that wheelchair?

15:32.933 --> 15:34.643
Oh, he said
a beam fell on him.

15:34.852 --> 15:37.897
After he ran back into
a burning building
to save a six-year-old.

15:38.105 --> 15:41.150
Well, he was still
the jealous type.

15:41.358 --> 15:45.029
And I saw online that
somewhere between receiving
the audio book approval copy

15:45.237 --> 15:49.783
and when she was murdered,
Grace replaced her name
on the book with a pen name.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.870
Maybe her husband wasn't
as cool with Grace's book
as he's letting on.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.873
Let's go pay him a visit.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.584
- She took her
name off the book?
- Grace never mentioned it?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.961
I mean, we talked about it.

16:01.170 --> 16:05.215
Grace was worried about
the book being under her name
if we had kids one day.

16:05.424 --> 16:07.593
I mean, it's kind of dirty.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.971
Do you think your wife
might have been writing about
her own sexual fantasies,

16:11.180 --> 16:13.349
using a sexy stewardess
as her proxy?

16:13.557 --> 16:15.601
I don't know.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.603
Maybe?
I mean, it can't have been
easy being married to...

16:19.688 --> 16:23.651
Mr. LeGare, do you mind
if we take a look
at your backyard?

16:23.859 --> 16:27.071
Stone patio in the back,
grass in the front.
Nowhere to grow hemlock.

16:27.279 --> 16:28.447
Maybe he bought it.

16:28.656 --> 16:30.491
I've scoured the darkest
parts of the Internet.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.493
All I could find were
some seeds on
a witchcraft website.

16:32.660 --> 16:34.036
But you still gotta
grow 'em.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.000
Sexy flight attendant.

16:41.752 --> 16:43.587
Excuse me, ma'am?

16:43.796 --> 16:45.255
Clive Babineaux, Seattle PD,

16:45.464 --> 16:47.466
this is Liv Moore with
the medical examiner's office.

16:47.675 --> 16:49.009
Alyssa Tramell.

16:49.218 --> 16:51.178
We're looking into the murder
of Grace LeGare.

16:51.387 --> 16:53.931
Did you know she'd
written a book that
she was getting published?

16:54.139 --> 16:56.266
Of course.
She was thrilled about it.

16:56.475 --> 16:59.311
Did you know it was about
the erotic adventures
of a sexy flight attendant?

17:00.604 --> 17:02.773
- Hey, baby...
- Hi.

17:02.982 --> 17:05.776
Oh, they're from the police.
They're looking into
Grace's murder.

17:05.985 --> 17:08.278
Oh. It's awful, isn't it?

17:08.487 --> 17:10.239
This is my husband.

17:10.447 --> 17:12.074
Did you need anything else?

17:16.578 --> 17:18.247
Here's my card.

17:20.249 --> 17:23.544
If you think of anything,
don't hesitate to call.

17:23.752 --> 17:26.588
Or if we don't hear from you,
maybe we'll drop back by.

17:27.715 --> 17:29.174
Thank you, Detectives.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.347
Why do people
bury license plates?

17:35.556 --> 17:37.641
Do they think cars are going
to grow out of the ground?

17:37.850 --> 17:40.227
All this digging in a field,
and still no tainted Utopium,

17:40.436 --> 17:42.813
but I have license plates
from 30 states.

17:43.022 --> 17:44.356
I'm booked tomorrow,
but I can do the day after.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.650
Have you guys ever wrestled?

17:46.859 --> 17:48.694
Stripped down, oiled up,

17:48.902 --> 17:51.447
seen who winds up on top?

17:51.655 --> 17:54.450
- Have we?
- Strangely enough, no.

17:55.534 --> 17:57.161
Night's young.

17:57.369 --> 18:00.497
Sorry. Porny librarian
sneaking through.

18:00.706 --> 18:02.041
It's just you two...

18:03.042 --> 18:04.334
Oh. Oopsie.

18:07.629 --> 18:10.257
Liv. Our flight attendant
neighbor just reached out.

18:10.466 --> 18:12.676
- You available if
she comes in now?
- Sure.

18:12.885 --> 18:16.180
If you do wrestle, film it.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.682
A change of plans.
That was Bozzio.

18:18.891 --> 18:19.933
Your lover?

18:21.268 --> 18:22.644
FBI Agent Bozzio.

18:22.853 --> 18:24.730
We'll bring the
flight attendant tomorrow.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.940
I've gotta follow up
on this GPS thing,
they finally turned it on.

18:27.733 --> 18:29.193
Good luck.

18:30.861 --> 18:33.030
He really fills out
those fitted shirts, huh?

18:33.238 --> 18:34.364
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.492
What's the GPS thing?

18:36.700 --> 18:38.535
One of the missing rich guys
had a dog.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.205
And the dog has a GPS tracker
and they turned it on.

18:41.413 --> 18:43.624
They're hoping it leads them
to the Chaos Killer.

18:47.044 --> 18:48.796
Well...

18:49.004 --> 18:51.840
Gotta run, kids. Duty calls.

18:52.049 --> 18:53.425
Why leave now? It's rush hour.

18:53.634 --> 18:54.802
All the more reason.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.697
Ugh. Why is the little dot
not coming up?

19:15.906 --> 19:17.116
You gotta tap reload
to make it...

19:17.324 --> 19:19.743
- Did you hear that?
- What?

19:19.952 --> 19:23.831
It sounded like a man who's
never used this app in his
life trying to mansplain.

19:24.039 --> 19:26.500
- You asked me.
- Mmm...

19:26.708 --> 19:28.043
We got it.

19:28.252 --> 19:30.337
Signal's locked.
Looks like it's holding still.

19:30.546 --> 19:32.339
Good. Traffic's bad,
it's gonna take 10 minutes.

19:50.524 --> 19:52.651
Hello? Hello?

19:53.527 --> 19:55.279
Hello?

19:55.487 --> 19:57.114
- Are you all right?
- Hey, I'm fine,
I just need my dog.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.365
Oh, he's not
quite ready yet.

19:58.574 --> 20:00.617
Just give me
my dog!

20:00.826 --> 20:03.370
Hey, hold on!
I'm sorry.

20:03.579 --> 20:05.372
I don't mean to yell.
It's just, uh...

20:07.749 --> 20:09.042
Minor is stolen.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.836
I stole him.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.380
- What?
- I'm a personal trainer. Okay?

20:13.589 --> 20:15.883
Minor belonged to
a guy I was training. A cop.

20:16.091 --> 20:18.719
- But the cop abused him,
beat him.
- Oh, my God.

20:18.927 --> 20:23.056
I know it's scary,
but I need you
to cover for me.

20:23.265 --> 20:26.268
Please, just give me Minor,
and when the cops show up,

20:26.476 --> 20:28.729
- I was never here.
- The police?

20:28.937 --> 20:30.772
- You want me to lie...
- Please!

20:30.981 --> 20:33.358
Please. This guy is a monster.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.819
We close?

20:36.945 --> 20:38.238
We're right on top of it.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.414
Okay. Here we go.

20:47.623 --> 20:49.583
Here we go. Here's daddy.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.084
Come on, sweetheart.
There you go.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.046
Thank you.

21:06.892 --> 21:09.061
Oh, come on, man,

21:09.269 --> 21:11.146
you're telling me the
rich tech guru didn't spring
for the microchip implant?

21:11.355 --> 21:13.273
- The tracker's not in the dog?
- You're holding it.

21:13.482 --> 21:15.484
It's in the dongle.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.612
We're not far from the park
where our missing tech guru
was abducted.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.280
The kidnapper
probably tossed it.

21:22.241 --> 21:26.203
You're going to be famous,
buddy. Yeah! You know that?

21:27.287 --> 21:28.747
Huh?

21:29.790 --> 21:31.583
Everyone's looking for you.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.504
Yeah, I know.

21:35.712 --> 21:38.423
This time tomorrow,
you'll have a great home,

21:38.632 --> 21:40.300
maybe a couple of kids.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.721
I'm sorry, buddy.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.601
I'm gonna miss you.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.265
Ms. Tramell.
Thanks for coming in.

22:28.473 --> 22:30.392
Alyssa, please.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.437
And thank you for
letting me do this here.

22:33.645 --> 22:36.565
It seemed like you didn't
want to answer our questions
in front of your husband.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.276
Can you blame me?
Grace's book is about me.

22:39.484 --> 22:42.195
I told her about my flings
because I felt bad for her.

22:42.404 --> 22:43.739
They were the only
sex life she had.

22:43.947 --> 22:45.741
Only? You mean Andy couldn't?

22:45.949 --> 22:47.909
Worse. Wouldn't.

22:48.118 --> 22:51.747
She's gone without
for five years,
since his accident.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.957
Five years!

22:54.166 --> 22:55.584
Were you worried people
would read her book
and figure out it was you?

22:55.792 --> 22:57.294
I knew they would.

22:57.502 --> 22:59.421
A Latina flight attendant
named Ally?

22:59.629 --> 23:01.631
How did you get
to see the manuscript?

23:01.840 --> 23:04.760
Grace showed me.
She wanted me to sign a
release, but I wouldn't do it.

23:04.968 --> 23:07.262
A week later, I get
a call from her editor,

23:07.471 --> 23:09.139
lady's name was Lerna Stern,

23:09.348 --> 23:11.933
saying they'd changed
the character's name
and hair color,

23:12.142 --> 23:15.062
and they felt confident enough
to go ahead and publish
without my release.

23:15.270 --> 23:18.315
Did Grace offer
to use a pen name?
Help disguise you that way?

23:18.523 --> 23:20.609
A pen name?
Are you kidding?

23:20.817 --> 23:24.446
Getting that book published
was her dream.

23:24.654 --> 23:26.448
Do you have the number
for Grace's editor
saved on your phone?

23:30.327 --> 23:32.245
- Ladies room?
- Through those doors.
To the right.

23:38.835 --> 23:41.296
Men are always so
phallocentric, Clive.
Why is that?

23:41.505 --> 23:42.839
Just are.

23:43.048 --> 23:45.092
Ms. Stern. This is
Clive Babineaux, Seattle PD.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.302
I'm investigating the murder
of Grace LeGare.

23:47.511 --> 23:48.845
<i>I thought it was an accident.</i>

23:49.054 --> 23:51.556
I'm afraid she was murdered.
Hemlock poisoning.

23:51.765 --> 23:53.558
<i>Was hemlock sprinkled
in her salad?</i>

23:56.812 --> 23:58.647
Ma'am, would you, uh...
Could you repeat that?

23:58.855 --> 24:01.650
<i>I asked if the hemlock
was sprinkled in her salad.</i>

24:01.858 --> 24:02.984
Why do you ask?

24:03.193 --> 24:05.654
<i>A few weeks back,
Grace sent me a manuscript
by a friend of hers.</i>

24:05.862 --> 24:06.822
<i>A murder mystery.</i>

24:07.030 --> 24:08.490
<i>The death was
hemlock poisoning.</i>

24:08.698 --> 24:10.826
Was the author
Muriel Fletcher?

24:11.034 --> 24:13.870
<i>Wow. Yeah. That's right.</i>

24:14.079 --> 24:17.124
I think we can get
a search warrant
for Muriel's off this.

24:17.332 --> 24:21.378
Calderon's getting Utopium,
plus the oxy he
was handling already.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.463
And he'll be taking deliveries
from the Blue Cobras.

24:23.672 --> 24:26.508
That is the primo Utopium
supply point in all
of our fair city.

24:31.012 --> 24:32.889
This is gold
you're giving me, Deaux.

24:33.098 --> 24:36.685
Nah. Just the humble
wit and wisdom of a
reformed U slinger.

24:36.893 --> 24:39.771
The mayor wouldn't be
sending free booze if
your info was humble.

24:41.064 --> 24:43.150
- That's from the mayor?
- Yeah.

24:45.402 --> 24:49.072
"Keep up the good work.
You're a credit
to your gender."

24:49.281 --> 24:52.200
Well, looks like she means it.
This is quality stuff.

24:56.538 --> 24:57.956
I couldn't have done
this without you.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.670
You want in?

25:07.883 --> 25:10.552
You did not do time
in a Colombian prison.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.179
All right.
We're cutting you off.

25:14.598 --> 25:17.726
Costa Rica.
And it was more of a
drunk tank than a prison.

25:17.934 --> 25:20.061
- Still, it sounds made up.
- Oh, it's all true.

25:20.270 --> 25:23.231
My cousin Timmy and I flew
down to Tamarindo
after graduation.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.568
One night, Tim and I
are getting yacked up
on kamikazes at this bar.

25:26.776 --> 25:28.612
We're running up a tab.

25:28.820 --> 25:31.072
And at some point, one of us
reaches for our wallet,
it's gone.

25:31.281 --> 25:32.407
We'd both been pickpocketed.

25:32.616 --> 25:35.202
So you got busted
trying to walk a check?

25:36.244 --> 25:37.579
That's not really badass.

25:37.787 --> 25:40.207
Patience. All right? Now,
the pedicab driver

25:40.415 --> 25:41.625
that delivered us to this dive

25:41.833 --> 25:44.127
is getting more blitzed
at the bar than us.

25:44.336 --> 25:46.755
So I walk outside,
I steal the pedicab,

25:46.963 --> 25:48.757
I drive American tourists
around for three hours,

25:48.965 --> 25:51.051
I make 80 bucks,
and I walk back in the bar.

25:51.259 --> 25:52.469
Grand theft bicycle.

25:52.677 --> 25:54.262
That would have been
way cooler, but no.

25:54.471 --> 25:57.224
The cop arrested me for
operating a cab
without a license.

26:01.186 --> 26:04.022
You expected a "no" when you
asked me if I've ever been
arrested, didn't you?

26:06.441 --> 26:08.735
I didn't ask if
you'd been arrested.

26:11.488 --> 26:15.575
I asked if you'd
ever been handcuffed.

26:30.465 --> 26:31.633
No! Wait!

26:31.841 --> 26:33.593
I'm taking advantage of you.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.762
I don't think that's true.

26:35.971 --> 26:39.099
Wait. I roofied you
with horny librarian brain.

26:39.808 --> 26:40.934
That's a first.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.353
Mmm.

26:43.562 --> 26:45.855
Oh, she hadn't gotten
laid in years.

26:46.064 --> 26:49.317
- This really isn't me.
- This isn't, uh, far from me.

26:49.526 --> 26:52.487
Really, I would've been
willing pre-brain. Pre-zombie.

26:52.696 --> 26:54.281
Pretty much any time
after my 12th birthday.

26:55.490 --> 26:56.950
Okay...

26:58.493 --> 27:00.328
Here's the plan.

27:00.537 --> 27:04.499
If we're still interested when
this brain wears off a bit,

27:04.708 --> 27:07.961
we can pick up
where we left off.

27:08.169 --> 27:10.422
But right now,
we can't do this.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.467
Story of my life.

27:14.676 --> 27:17.929
Zombie date sends me away
until horny brain wears off.

27:30.400 --> 27:34.487
I don't know why I do it,
but it started in college.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.364
I'm not hearing it.

27:36.573 --> 27:37.741
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:37.949 --> 27:39.701
Hmm. It's just whiskey.

27:40.869 --> 27:42.662
And I don't...

27:42.871 --> 27:44.539
I don't know what it is,

27:44.748 --> 27:45.749
but it makes me
drunk southern.

27:45.957 --> 27:47.375
- Uh-huh.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:47.584 --> 27:48.918
What about champagne?

27:49.127 --> 27:50.545
Do you go French?

27:50.754 --> 27:53.048
Ooh! What about tequila?

27:53.256 --> 27:55.216
Oh, God, no.
You do not want to know

27:55.425 --> 27:57.886
what happens to me
when I drink tequila.

27:58.094 --> 27:59.346
I'm pretty sure I do.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.681
- No. No.
- Yes.

28:01.890 --> 28:03.725
As for me...

28:03.933 --> 28:06.269
I go drunk cockney, I do.
Oh!

28:06.478 --> 28:10.690
A cuppa mudder's ruin,
luv, an it's all "Varder
those bonnie lallies."

28:10.899 --> 28:12.567
Etcetera, etcetera.

28:24.579 --> 28:26.539
- So, this hair...
- Mmm-hmm?

28:26.706 --> 28:28.541
Hmm.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.251
How much product do
you got working in here?

28:30.460 --> 28:34.798
It's just a dollop of pomade
and I'm out the door.

28:35.006 --> 28:36.216
- No!
- Yup.

28:38.093 --> 28:40.762
I think you put some
serious time into this look.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.430
Well, we can't
all look like

28:42.639 --> 28:46.393
we were created in a lab
by 14-year-old boys, can we?

29:03.576 --> 29:04.744
Oh, God.

29:24.431 --> 29:27.267
Little white flowers in an
umbrella pattern. Use gloves.

29:29.644 --> 29:32.147
Muriel Fletcher.
This is a warrant
to search your property.

29:32.355 --> 29:34.441
On what grounds?

29:34.649 --> 29:37.652
You failed to mention that
a character in your novel
eats a hemlock salad.

29:37.861 --> 29:39.320
You had access
to Grace's lunch.

29:39.529 --> 29:40.655
You were jealous.

29:40.864 --> 29:42.490
Grace wrote pornography.

29:42.699 --> 29:44.993
If that's success,
I want no part of it.

29:45.201 --> 29:48.621
Is that why you asked Grace
to give your manuscript
to her publishers?

29:48.830 --> 29:50.623
Sir. You've gotta see this.

30:00.300 --> 30:03.678
Yes. Yes, I garden.
But I don't grow hemlock.

30:03.887 --> 30:06.473
And my book is nothing
like Grace's murder!

30:06.681 --> 30:08.516
The publisher sent the PDF.

30:08.725 --> 30:11.352
"The little fool had no idea
I put hemlock in her salad.

30:11.561 --> 30:15.315
"There she sat, her molars
mashing the leaves into
the shape of her destiny."

30:17.525 --> 30:19.277
"The shape of her destiny"?

30:20.528 --> 30:22.363
She wants me to send it
to my editor,

30:22.572 --> 30:24.324
but I can't do that to Lerna.

30:24.532 --> 30:26.034
Here, let me see that.

30:28.411 --> 30:30.872
Sir, this was
in the fireplace.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.332
First thing we saw.

30:37.253 --> 30:39.005
Bound galleys
for Grace's book.

30:41.424 --> 30:43.092
I'm guessing you tried to
destroy it when you heard

30:43.301 --> 30:45.845
we had figured out Grace
had to have been poisoned.

30:46.054 --> 30:50.475
All these nasty comments you
wrote in the margins
speak to motive.

30:52.393 --> 30:53.645
Should've stoked
your fire better.

30:55.396 --> 30:57.232
Clive, look.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.360
In this version, Grace used
her real name.
And a photograph.

31:01.361 --> 31:03.029
It's not very anonymous...

31:03.238 --> 31:05.031
Is that what I think it is?

31:08.368 --> 31:09.536
Water hemlock.

31:10.912 --> 31:14.707
In the window box of
Grace and Andy's house.

31:14.916 --> 31:20.088
I'll be inside,
itemizing a bill
for the damages to my garden.

31:24.259 --> 31:27.428
In my vision, I saw Grace
reading Muriel's book to Andy.

31:27.637 --> 31:29.597
But she wasn't giving it
to her editor.

31:29.806 --> 31:32.267
What if Andy sent the book,
posing as Grace?

31:32.475 --> 31:37.105
Then uses the book as
a blueprint to kill his wife.

31:37.313 --> 31:41.109
Your wife's publisher provided
us the email where Grace
requested a pen name.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.820
Funny thing,
it was from a new account.

31:44.028 --> 31:46.447
One set up from your home
while Grace was at work.

31:46.656 --> 31:48.199
You sent that email.

31:48.408 --> 31:50.952
Your nurse Todd confirmed
you had a window box planter.

31:51.160 --> 31:54.497
The week before Grace's death,
you ordered him to
take it down, trash it.

31:54.706 --> 31:57.250
He didn't. He gave it to
another one of his patients.

31:57.458 --> 31:59.127
Now we have it.

31:59.335 --> 32:01.087
What do you think
the soil analysis
is gonna show us?

32:03.172 --> 32:04.382
Water hemlock.

32:07.427 --> 32:10.305
I'm going to be in this chair
for the rest of my life.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.641
You know what gets me
through my days?

32:13.850 --> 32:17.353
Knowing that people look at me
and they see a hero.

32:17.562 --> 32:19.230
You know what I was going
to be once that book came out?

32:21.316 --> 32:23.610
The guy who couldn't give it
to his wife,

32:23.818 --> 32:26.362
so she fantasizes about
doing it with everybody else.

32:26.571 --> 32:28.823
Threesomes. French guys.

32:29.032 --> 32:30.825
- Ex-cons.
- She didn't cheat on you.

32:31.034 --> 32:32.160
They weren't her stories.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.620
No one's gonna believe that.

32:33.828 --> 32:35.496
I begged her not to publish.

32:35.705 --> 32:36.831
She didn't care.

32:38.166 --> 32:41.169
My wife didn't care.

32:53.723 --> 32:56.059
If this is about your missing
tech millionaire's
basset hound,

32:56.267 --> 32:58.353
I heard someone
found him on a bus.

32:58.561 --> 33:00.313
It's not about that dog.

33:00.521 --> 33:03.191
It's about this one.

33:03.399 --> 33:05.026
- Deaux's got a record?
- And a different name.

33:05.234 --> 33:07.487
DeBeers, comma, Blaine.

33:12.158 --> 33:13.868
Blaine.

33:14.077 --> 33:16.996
- We found him.
- Gets crazier.

33:17.205 --> 33:19.332
DeBeers is an alias too.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.709
It's a moniker he picked up
from some high schoolers
he sold beer and pot to

33:21.918 --> 33:24.587
with a real winner,
Julien DeWeed.

33:24.796 --> 33:28.257
As in "Blaine's got da beers,
Julien's got da weed."

33:28.466 --> 33:29.717
That's Julien DeWeed?

33:29.926 --> 33:32.053
- AKA Julien Dupont.
- You know him?

33:32.261 --> 33:34.347
He was one of the
corpses at Meat Cute.

33:34.555 --> 33:37.892
This is the guy
Major Lilywhite
claimed attacked him.

33:38.101 --> 33:41.896
And that is a completely
crazy revelation,
but here's the coolest part.

33:42.105 --> 33:44.065
How can what I just said
not be the coolest part?

33:45.942 --> 33:48.027
Blaine's real last name
is McDonough.

33:48.236 --> 33:51.239
He is the son
of Angus McDonough.

33:51.447 --> 33:54.075
Blaine's father is one
of the Chaos Killer's victims.

33:54.283 --> 33:57.870
To go with the two other
victims, whose phones
contained Blaine's number.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.710
Okay. We gotta go slow.
It's all circumstantial.

34:03.918 --> 34:06.045
Or we go arrest him right now.

34:06.254 --> 34:09.632
Never mind we don't have any
physical evidence
connecting him to the crimes.

34:09.841 --> 34:11.926
How much would you like me
if I told you

34:12.135 --> 34:14.554
Blaine DeBeers has an
outstanding warrant
for possession

34:15.596 --> 34:17.223
with intent to sell?

34:20.059 --> 34:21.978
I'd like you a lot.

34:22.186 --> 34:24.605
Let's put him in
jail for a few years.
Figure out the rest later.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.117
I'm chafing a little here.

34:36.325 --> 34:38.536
I suppose it's too much
to ask for the fuzzy ones?

34:38.745 --> 34:41.873
You've been
read your rights.
You've had your phone call.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.709
We spoke a few days ago
about your number turning up
in the phones

34:44.917 --> 34:46.044
of two kidnapping victims.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.087
A couple rando,
would-be customers.

34:48.296 --> 34:49.630
I told you,
it's a coincidence.

34:49.839 --> 34:51.049
Seems pretty unlikely.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.301
Yeah. That's what
"coincidence" means.

34:53.509 --> 34:57.930
So two would-be customers
abducted by the Chaos Killer
is a coincidence.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.558
What's it called when
we add your dad to the list?

35:01.267 --> 35:03.394
A miracle?

35:03.603 --> 35:05.813
Why didn't you mention your
father was one of the
Chaos Killer's victims,

35:06.022 --> 35:06.939
Mr. McDonough?

35:08.649 --> 35:11.235
I didn't know.

35:11.444 --> 35:14.489
- We don't talk a whole lot.
- It's on the front page.

35:14.697 --> 35:17.241
- When did you find out?
- Right now.
I'm distraught.

35:17.450 --> 35:20.411
I won't rest until the
scoundrel is behind bars.

35:22.455 --> 35:26.626
This sketch was
based on a description
provided by someone

35:26.834 --> 35:29.629
you hired at the
Meat Cute charcuterie.

35:29.837 --> 35:31.631
Were you there the
night of the massacre?

35:31.839 --> 35:33.591
No. I was a part-timer.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.176
But the detective who was
killed that night

35:35.384 --> 35:37.345
didn't scrawl the names
of other part-timers

35:37.553 --> 35:38.805
on the wall in blood.

35:39.013 --> 35:40.389
Just yours.

35:43.476 --> 35:45.353
You want to tell me what
coincidence means again?

35:50.108 --> 35:54.445
We've met, haven't we?

35:54.654 --> 35:58.282
We have. After that
delivery kid went missing,
you swung by Meat Cute.

35:58.491 --> 36:00.118
You ever find out
what happened to that guy?

36:00.326 --> 36:01.577
Let's focus on you.

36:01.786 --> 36:03.162
But your lovely friend
will feel left out.

36:05.164 --> 36:06.874
Which neighborhood
are you living in, DB?

36:07.083 --> 36:09.043
So tricky finding the
right place to live when
you're new in town.

36:09.252 --> 36:10.878
- What makes you think I'm new?
- I assumed.

36:11.087 --> 36:13.923
You said you were
with the FBI, so...

36:15.341 --> 36:16.843
Which neighborhood?

36:17.051 --> 36:19.804
<i>♪ Which neighborhood? ♪</i>

36:20.012 --> 36:21.013
I want to say Ballard.

36:23.141 --> 36:24.976
I knew it. It's a gift.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.519
- Watch yourself.
- I'm sorry.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.604
I didn't mean
to upset your girl.

36:29.897 --> 36:31.649
Not to say that
I know she's your girl.

36:31.858 --> 36:35.987
I'm just assuming from the
chemistry which is <i>en fuego.</i>

36:36.195 --> 36:38.739
That drug charge of yours
has a 10-year max sentence.

36:38.948 --> 36:40.908
And once we let a judge
know everything you've
been up to...

36:41.117 --> 36:42.827
You can mail us some
of these threats from prison.

36:45.580 --> 36:47.540
This interview is over.
I need you to cut him loose.

36:47.748 --> 36:49.250
- Ms. Charles?
- Who the hell is this?

36:49.458 --> 36:50.960
Assistant District Attorney
Peyton Charles.

36:52.712 --> 36:55.214
The warrant is void.
He has immunity

36:55.423 --> 36:57.175
in exchange for his
cooperation in a case.

36:58.885 --> 37:01.304
We need to talk.

37:04.265 --> 37:05.349
Okay.

37:06.559 --> 37:09.187
Hang tight.

37:09.395 --> 37:10.646
You look good
on a white horse.

37:15.026 --> 37:16.694
What the hell is
happening here, Peyton?

37:16.903 --> 37:18.237
Why are you
protecting this creep?

37:18.446 --> 37:20.406
Look, the four-year-old
drug charges?

37:20.573 --> 37:22.700
I mean, they're meaningless
compared to the information
he's giving us.

37:22.909 --> 37:25.536
Look, I promise,
he is more valuable to me
than he is you.

37:25.745 --> 37:27.747
Besides, he's reformed.
He's a business owner.

37:27.955 --> 37:29.582
He's the Chaos Killer.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.459
What do you have?

37:31.667 --> 37:33.920
His number,
stored in the phones
of two of our victims.

37:34.128 --> 37:36.964
- It's thin.
- Plus, one of the
victims was his dad.

37:37.173 --> 37:40.092
He mention anything about
his dad going missing
while you were deposing him?

37:40.301 --> 37:43.262
We also like him for
the Meat Cute Massacre.

37:43.471 --> 37:45.640
- That case was solved.
- Yeah, officially, maybe.

37:45.848 --> 37:47.725
But this is
a police sketch done

37:47.934 --> 37:49.936
from Liv's little brother's
description of the man
who hired him.

37:50.144 --> 37:53.105
The detective killed
that night at Meat Cute?

37:53.314 --> 37:55.900
He wrote that man's name
in blood on the walls.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.944
That guy in there,

37:58.152 --> 38:00.238
that guy you
granted immunity to,

38:01.405 --> 38:02.615
has murdered a dozen people.

38:05.618 --> 38:07.578
Unless you have enough
to book him for
either of these crimes,

38:07.787 --> 38:08.746
I need you to turn him loose.

38:17.255 --> 38:18.714
What happens next is on you.

38:47.994 --> 38:50.621
Peyton? What's wrong?

38:53.124 --> 38:54.292
Do you know who this is?

38:56.711 --> 38:57.837
Come inside.

39:03.175 --> 39:04.969
Why are you showing
me a photo of Blaine?

39:05.177 --> 39:07.680
He's dangerous.
Stay away from him.

39:07.888 --> 39:09.223
That's not an option.

39:09.432 --> 39:10.808
He's my star witness
against Mr. Boss.

39:11.017 --> 39:12.184
He's pretty much
the whole case.

39:12.351 --> 39:14.520
Peyton, he killed Lowell.

39:14.729 --> 39:17.481
He tried to kill Major.
He got Evan blown up.

39:17.690 --> 39:20.234
He turned me into a zombie.

39:20.443 --> 39:23.195
He murdered God knows
how many homeless teenagers

39:23.404 --> 39:25.698
and sold their brains
to zombies as food.

39:34.665 --> 39:35.708
What's going on?

39:38.919 --> 39:40.171
I slept with him.

39:43.215 --> 39:44.508
I didn't know who he was.

39:48.012 --> 39:49.513
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

39:51.265 --> 39:52.725
It's okay.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.853
It's okay.

40:09.241 --> 40:13.537
Minor, guess
who found some bones!

40:15.456 --> 40:17.249
Hey.

40:17.416 --> 40:20.461
Good night of making
rich white people less fat?

40:20.669 --> 40:24.298
- Yeah,
it's God's work, what I do.
- Where's Minor?

40:24.507 --> 40:25.883
Gone, I'm afraid.

40:27.718 --> 40:30.262
Gone? Gone where?

40:30.471 --> 40:32.973
I saw a missing dog flyer
on a telephone pole
with a photo of Minor.

40:33.182 --> 40:35.893
So I called the number,
the owners swung by
and picked him up.

40:37.103 --> 40:38.479
Oh.

40:38.687 --> 40:40.022
They must've been thrilled.

40:40.981 --> 40:43.067
Yeah. Happy ending.

40:43.275 --> 40:44.944
Bummer for us, though.

40:45.152 --> 40:48.447
Yeah, I do wish I could've
said goodbye.

40:49.407 --> 40:50.616
Oh, I'm sorry. I just...

40:50.783 --> 40:52.076
You know,
they got here so fast.

40:58.499 --> 40:59.625
I should, uh,

41:00.960 --> 41:03.421
head home and
take a Silkwood shower.

41:03.629 --> 41:05.548
Are you sure you're okay?

41:08.300 --> 41:09.593
Yeah.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.652
You know,
you sleep with someone,

41:28.195 --> 41:29.447
you think you know them.

41:31.657 --> 41:32.950
But they could be anybody.

41:34.702 --> 41:36.287
Good night.

41:52.428 --> 41:53.387
Everything okay?
