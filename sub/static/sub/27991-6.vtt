00:00.001 --> 00:01.601
Previously on Miracle Workers

00:01.810 --> 00:04.410
You want to destroy the entire world?

00:04.480 --> 00:06.056
Yeah. But that's not why
I brought you in here.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.280
This here is a restaurant.

00:08.290 --> 00:11.350
What? I call it... Lazy Susan's.

00:11.420 --> 00:15.690
I already have a prototype for the claw.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.360
All we have to do is
get these two to kiss.

00:19.430 --> 00:21.160
Friday? Friday.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.230
Yes!

00:22.300 --> 00:23.499
Yes!

00:23.500 --> 00:25.300
Is that enough time?

00:25.370 --> 00:27.700
Just barely.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.850
This is it.

00:45.920 --> 00:46.920
The big day.

00:47.790 --> 00:51.790
If I don't land these investors...

00:51.860 --> 00:54.500
Lazy Susan's doesn't stand a chance.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.670
Who you pitching to?

00:57.730 --> 01:00.140
A couple of real power players.

01:03.210 --> 01:06.610
Mom, Dad?

01:06.680 --> 01:08.210
I'm coming home.

01:40.110 --> 01:42.240
Da-doo-di-da

01:42.310 --> 01:44.110
Da-doo-di-da

01:44.180 --> 01:46.250
Da-doo-di-da

01:46.320 --> 01:47.920
Da-doo-di-da

01:47.980 --> 01:49.650
♪ Da-da-da, di-da

01:54.990 --> 01:56.930
No, buddy. No, you listen to me, okay?

01:56.990 --> 01:59.260
What don't you understand
about supply and "command"?

01:59.330 --> 02:00.599
I mean, it's easy.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.200
I want those numbers going up, not down.

02:02.270 --> 02:03.870
And if you can't... Sorry.

02:03.930 --> 02:06.330
If you can't put... Then
it's your ass, all right?

02:06.400 --> 02:07.799
I-I want... Yes.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.600
At the end of the quarter,
I want those numbers

02:09.610 --> 02:10.740
on my desk, yesterday.

02:10.810 --> 02:11.810
Right.

02:11.811 --> 02:13.009
We're sorry.

02:13.010 --> 02:14.209
Wow.

02:14.210 --> 02:15.540
Sorry. Work stuff.

02:15.610 --> 02:18.880
Just, if I leave for
a minute, it's, uh...

02:18.905 --> 02:20.355
Anyway, hi.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.180
Hey, there, kiddo. It's been a while.

02:22.205 --> 02:24.020
Bring it in.

02:24.090 --> 02:27.690
Mom, Dad.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.930
Okay.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.630
All right, guys, how's it looking?

02:37.700 --> 02:39.700
All good here. Sam showered today.

02:39.770 --> 02:42.570
Good here, too. Laura's picked
out her least-stained shirt.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.556
Craig, have they finalized
their plans for the date?

02:44.580 --> 02:45.970
Yes. They are going to the cinema.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.110
That is perfect!

02:47.180 --> 02:49.040
Dark theater, sitting
next to each other...

02:49.050 --> 02:50.556
It doesn't get more romantic than that.

02:50.580 --> 02:53.520
What are they seeing? Oh. This.

02:53.580 --> 02:54.980
The sewer.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.249
Tunnels filled with feces.

02:57.250 --> 02:59.120
Rats and slime.

02:59.190 --> 03:01.190
The stench of human waste.

03:01.260 --> 03:04.260
Descend with me into
this nightmare world

03:04.330 --> 03:05.659
of our own making...

03:05.660 --> 03:07.059
in 3-D.

03:07.060 --> 03:08.446
Yeah, they're not gonna
kiss watching that.

03:08.470 --> 03:09.730
What do we do?

03:09.800 --> 03:11.600
We gotta get them on a better date.

03:15.470 --> 03:16.869
So, how's your planet, son?

03:16.870 --> 03:18.386
It's going great,
Dad. Thanks for asking.

03:18.410 --> 03:20.879
We just celebrated another
million years without war.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.410
Wow. Somebody's going
after his mom's record.

03:23.480 --> 03:25.680
And, sweetheart,

03:25.750 --> 03:27.950
I heard you're doing an
amazing job running your planet.

03:28.020 --> 03:29.750
Well, you know, it's a utopia,

03:29.820 --> 03:31.820
so it kind of runs itself.

03:31.890 --> 03:33.690
Of course.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.020
Me too.

03:42.045 --> 03:43.075
What?

03:43.100 --> 03:46.499
Oh, uh, yeah, I'm
also doing really good.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.040
Oh, right.

03:48.110 --> 03:49.500
Your... planet.

03:49.570 --> 03:52.370
Uh, how is Turd?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.040
It's... It's "Earth."

03:54.110 --> 03:55.580
Earth. Right. Sorry.

03:55.650 --> 03:56.980
Earth.

03:57.050 --> 03:58.050
My apologies.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.780
It's going really great.

03:59.850 --> 04:01.180
Thanks for asking.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.120
But... ahem...

04:03.190 --> 04:05.919
I've actually been working
on a whole new project.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.719
Here we go. All right.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.330
Mom, Dad, it's pitch time.

04:10.390 --> 04:11.730
Come on.

04:17.529 --> 04:18.800
Okay, okay, new pitch.

04:18.870 --> 04:20.670
Uh, how about a romantic carriage ride?

04:20.740 --> 04:22.400
Nope. Sam's afraid of horses.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.670
Doesn't like their eyes.

04:23.740 --> 04:25.740
All right, then, uh, what
about an eyeless horse?

04:25.810 --> 04:27.139
We get some crows, right?

04:27.140 --> 04:28.456
Wait, where are you getting crows from?

04:28.480 --> 04:29.880
It's Earth. Anywhere.

04:29.950 --> 04:31.280
We get them to swoop down

04:31.350 --> 04:33.349
and peck the eyes out of the horse.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.126
No, crows only peck eyes
out of dead things, though.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.549
So unless you're gonna
get a dead horse...

04:36.550 --> 04:37.949
Then I'll get a dead horse!

04:37.950 --> 04:40.160
Have you guys ever
thought about a Kiss Cam?

04:40.220 --> 04:41.759
Rosie. That's brilliant!

04:41.760 --> 04:43.359
Sorry. What... W-What is a "Kiss Cam"?

04:43.360 --> 04:45.076
Oh, it's this thing they
do at sporting events.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.500
They find two people in the stands,

04:46.560 --> 04:48.360
point a camera at them,
and they have to kiss.

04:48.430 --> 04:50.070
There's a basketball game tonight.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.860
The arena is in Sam and
Laura's neighborhood.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.546
Oh, okay. Sorry. Are we
all... We all positive

04:53.570 --> 04:55.930
this is the best idea, just
putting them on a massive screen

04:55.970 --> 04:57.170
in front of loads of people?

04:57.240 --> 04:58.510
Let's make it happen.

04:58.580 --> 05:01.040
Yeah.

05:01.110 --> 05:04.510
And on this island, there
are dozens of capable chefs

05:04.580 --> 05:06.110
making all sorts of foods...

05:06.180 --> 05:09.520
pizza, pasta, even French, right?

05:09.590 --> 05:10.920
And when you see a food you like,

05:10.990 --> 05:13.520
you grab it with this long claw.

05:13.590 --> 05:15.660
And it all goes down...

05:15.730 --> 05:18.060
at Lazy Susan's.

05:32.140 --> 05:33.740
I don't know how they put up with this.

05:33.810 --> 05:38.480
Mom's on a lot of pills.

05:38.550 --> 05:39.880
Whoo!

05:39.950 --> 05:41.326
Okay, Nelson, I think we've got it,

05:41.350 --> 05:42.890
but let's just get a few more takes,

05:42.950 --> 05:44.290
just to be on the safe si... Wow.

05:44.350 --> 05:46.150
So, I guess what's
left is to talk numbers?

05:46.220 --> 05:50.290
Well, uh, before your father
and I invest in this... thing,

05:50.360 --> 05:52.160
we need to talk in private. Yes.

05:52.230 --> 05:54.630
Ohh! I see. You want to
get together your offer.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.229
All right.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.146
But if you think you're
gonna take more than 49%,

05:58.170 --> 05:59.700
you got another thing coming.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.710
All right.

06:03.770 --> 06:05.310
I was just kidding.

06:05.380 --> 06:06.510
I love you guys.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.610
Love you.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.280
Hey, Sam. So, this is weird,

06:13.350 --> 06:15.280
but it looks like the theater
we were gonna go to tonight

06:15.290 --> 06:17.820
is on fire.

06:17.890 --> 06:18.950
Is everyone okay?

06:19.020 --> 06:20.820
No. A lot of people died.

06:20.890 --> 06:22.820
Oh, God. So, is there anything else

06:22.890 --> 06:24.289
you might want to do tonight?

06:24.290 --> 06:26.490
This is gonna sound weird, but, uh,

06:26.500 --> 06:29.230
two tickets to a basketball
game landed on my head.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.370
What? Yeah, I was eating lunch,

06:31.440 --> 06:33.300
and a crow dropped them on me.

06:33.370 --> 06:35.300
They look like pretty good seats.

06:35.310 --> 06:36.640
Okay.

06:36.710 --> 06:38.310
Should we do that?

06:38.380 --> 06:39.380
Sure.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.440
Nice.

06:42.910 --> 06:44.650
What? - I just...

06:44.710 --> 06:47.119
How can we even be sure they're
going to end up on camera?

06:47.120 --> 06:48.296
All right, there's gonna be dozens

06:48.320 --> 06:49.626
of other couples going to this game.

06:49.650 --> 06:52.520
Actually, there's...

06:52.590 --> 06:53.790
212. - Right.

06:53.860 --> 06:55.036
So there's virtually no chance

06:55.060 --> 06:56.340
of Sam and Laura getting picked.

06:56.365 --> 06:57.372
Craig's right.

06:57.397 --> 06:59.190
We need to cull the herd. What?

06:59.260 --> 07:03.060
We take out all the other
couples, by any means necessary.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.470
Good job, Craig. - Amazing work.

07:04.530 --> 07:06.870
- This is really great.
- Thanks?

07:06.940 --> 07:09.070
Thank you.

07:09.140 --> 07:12.940
The good news is that
we are very proud of you.

07:13.010 --> 07:18.280
And we love that you have... ideas.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.949
- Great.
- That being said,

07:20.950 --> 07:22.280
with the market being what it is,

07:22.350 --> 07:24.420
we just don't think now is a good time

07:24.490 --> 07:26.090
for us to invest in anything.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.159
What about them?

07:29.160 --> 07:31.290
You invest in their stuff all the time.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.490
Well, uh...

07:32.560 --> 07:35.830
we just think the concept
for your restaurant...

07:35.900 --> 07:37.700
might be difficult to execute.

07:37.770 --> 07:41.570
Oh, well, I mean, if you
have any notes at all,

07:41.640 --> 07:44.569
I mean, big or small,
I'm... I'm totally open.

07:44.570 --> 07:47.779
Well, if you're asking for
notes, um, the "food claw"...

07:47.780 --> 07:50.110
Yeah, the claw stays.
I'm married to the claw.

07:50.180 --> 07:52.110
You lose the claw,
and you're compromising

07:52.180 --> 07:53.580
the integrity of Lazy Susan's.

07:53.650 --> 07:54.780
I mean...

07:54.850 --> 07:57.189
"Get rid of the claw," she says.

07:58.990 --> 08:00.189
Anything else?

08:00.190 --> 08:02.189
All right, guys. Keep it up.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.460
Only a few couples left.

08:03.530 --> 08:06.460
Come on, baby.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.070
Nice work, Eliza.

08:12.740 --> 08:14.070
Aah!

08:14.140 --> 08:15.800
Aah! Aah! No!

08:15.870 --> 08:17.070
Ah! Great job, Rosie.

08:17.140 --> 08:20.680
I can't go to the game.

08:20.740 --> 08:22.280
I have diarrhea.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.280
Sanjay, gross.

08:26.350 --> 08:29.135
That wasn't me. That
guy just has diarrhea.

08:29.257 --> 08:30.277
Oh.

08:30.873 --> 08:32.619
Well, anyway, we're in great shape.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.159
Look.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.230
Not as many people as I expected.

08:37.289 --> 08:40.229
Yeah, looks like we have this entire row

08:40.230 --> 08:42.030
to ourselves. -

08:43.100 --> 08:44.700
Maybe these are bad teams?

08:44.770 --> 08:46.100
That's okay.

08:46.170 --> 08:48.770
Honestly, I don't know that
much about basketball anyway.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.170
Me neither.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.039
I was just gonna start
cheering for the team

08:52.040 --> 08:54.039
that you started cheering for.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.580
Wait. That was my plan, too.

08:57.050 --> 08:58.780
Cheers? Cheers.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.780
Ahh.

09:02.850 --> 09:05.590
You know, I'm glad those
tickets fell on your head.

09:05.660 --> 09:06.860
This is fun.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.659
You're not bored?

09:08.660 --> 09:10.459
I think you could have
taken me anywhere tonight,

09:10.460 --> 09:11.859
and I wouldn't have been bored.

09:11.860 --> 09:13.636
No, okay. I think we should
disable the Kiss Camera.

09:13.660 --> 09:16.000
Craig. No. They are
getting there on their own.

09:16.070 --> 09:17.306
They don't need any extra pressure.

09:17.330 --> 09:18.670
The Kiss Cam's gonna work.

09:18.740 --> 09:20.400
I mean, think about it.

09:20.470 --> 09:22.069
Put yourself in Sam's shoes.

09:22.070 --> 09:23.340
How so?

09:23.410 --> 09:26.140
Imagine you're, like, this lonely guy,

09:26.210 --> 09:28.340
not a lot of friends, socially awkward,

09:28.410 --> 09:29.880
everyone thinks you're weird.

09:29.950 --> 09:31.410
Okay, I will imagine that.

09:31.480 --> 09:35.080
And then one day, out of
the blue, this girl shows up,

09:35.150 --> 09:39.089
and you think she's the
coolest person you've ever met.

09:39.090 --> 09:41.689
Right, yes. And the more
you spend time with her,

09:41.690 --> 09:45.090
the more you realize
this girl kicks ass.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.960
She's awesome. You really like her.

09:47.030 --> 09:49.630
Okay. And it builds, and it builds

09:49.700 --> 09:52.430
until, one night, she's
sitting right next to you...

09:52.500 --> 09:54.499
like, as close as I am to you right now.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.140
Mm-hmm. And everyone's looking.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.980
You'd go for it. Right?

10:00.040 --> 10:02.640
Well, no, not necessarily.

10:02.710 --> 10:05.650
Not if I was unsure about
how she felt about me,

10:05.720 --> 10:08.050
or was scared to death
of losing her as a friend,

10:08.120 --> 10:10.850
and also pretty frightened
of her in general.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.320
What? What?

10:12.390 --> 10:13.990
Anyway, let's put it to a vote.

10:14.060 --> 10:16.060
Um, all against.

10:16.130 --> 10:18.660
All for.

10:18.730 --> 10:21.400
Okay, well, I suppose I have no choice

10:21.470 --> 10:22.646
but to accept the will of the group.

10:22.670 --> 10:24.400
This is a democracy, after all,

10:24.470 --> 10:26.370
so, yeah, consider the matter settled.

10:27.070 --> 10:28.339
- Craig!
- Whoa!

10:28.340 --> 10:29.610
- Hold on!
- What the

10:29.670 --> 10:32.270
No! You're wrong! These
are two very shy people!

10:34.140 --> 10:35.680
- Oh!
- I'm sorry.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.150
I'm very sorry. That was unprofessional.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.080
And I'm completely out of line.

10:40.150 --> 10:41.880
Frankly, I am ashamed of myself.

10:41.950 --> 10:43.420
No! - Oh!

10:43.490 --> 10:45.090
- You open that cabinet!
- No!

10:45.160 --> 10:46.550
- Yes.
- No, you'll ruin this!

10:46.620 --> 10:48.960
Do not put me in there! No!

10:49.030 --> 10:51.030
- Get him in.
- No! No, no!

10:51.090 --> 10:53.900
Ah, you're making a huge mistake!

10:53.960 --> 10:56.360
Let's get back to work.

10:56.370 --> 10:58.370
You guys, I... I

10:58.440 --> 11:00.900
I-I don't get the hesitation, right?

11:00.970 --> 11:02.170
You love the concept.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.569
And there's hardly any overhead.

11:03.570 --> 11:05.840
There's no tables, no waiters,

11:05.910 --> 11:07.579
no bathrooms, no walls...

11:07.580 --> 11:09.450
Why aren't there any bathrooms?

11:09.510 --> 11:11.379
Well, because it's a lazy river.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.120
So people would just...

11:13.180 --> 11:14.720
Yeah. They just go.

11:14.780 --> 11:18.589
Son, I'm not sure this is for us.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.720
Why?

11:19.790 --> 11:22.789
It just seems like a...
a very ambitious project,

11:22.790 --> 11:23.860
and we're worried...

11:23.930 --> 11:26.730
That you might not be able to handle it.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.330
Whoa.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.270
Y-You don't think I can do this?

11:32.340 --> 11:35.470
You think I'm not... good enough?

11:35.540 --> 11:38.009
You think there's
something wrong with me?

11:38.010 --> 11:39.270
No. No, sweetie,

11:39.340 --> 11:40.940
that's not what we were saying at all!

11:41.010 --> 11:44.350
No, no, no, no. We... We...
We love the river restaurant.

11:44.410 --> 11:45.950
Really?

11:46.020 --> 11:48.150
Yep. Count us in, champ.

11:48.220 --> 11:50.350
Okay, good!

11:50.420 --> 11:52.619
Now, for the first 10
locations, I've budgeted...

11:52.620 --> 11:54.890
- Are you kidding me?
- You're gonna bankroll this?!

11:54.960 --> 11:56.420
He's very passionate about it.

11:56.430 --> 11:57.630
It... It seems unique.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.500
That's just what you
said about the Earth.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.700
Okay, wait. This is way
different from the Earth.

12:01.770 --> 12:03.700
Mom, it's not. It's the same thing.

12:03.770 --> 12:06.230
Just another water circle
with people scrambling for food

12:06.300 --> 12:07.700
and shitting everywhere!

12:07.770 --> 12:08.770
Look.

12:11.710 --> 12:13.180
Remember when he pitched this?

12:13.240 --> 12:14.840
It was insane.

12:14.910 --> 12:16.040
It makes no sense.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.850
But we haaaad to be supportive
'cause he's the baby.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.756
Yeah, let's just forget
that he flunked out of school

12:20.780 --> 12:23.050
and write him a blank check
to start his own planet.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.720
Hey, I started nine planets.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.436
Yeah, well, you only
got one of them to work.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.060
Kids, that's enough.

12:29.130 --> 12:30.530
Your brother tried his best.

12:30.590 --> 12:31.790
That's what makes it so sad.

12:31.860 --> 12:33.330
You guys are being too harsh.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.860
How bad can Turd possibly be?

12:35.870 --> 12:37.130
We'll tell you.

12:41.870 --> 12:43.540
Oh!

12:43.610 --> 12:45.140
Whoo!

12:54.280 --> 12:57.550
What-What-What-What.
What the what?!

12:57.620 --> 13:00.890
It's time for the Jammin' 103 Kiss Cam!

13:00.960 --> 13:05.330
Brought to you by T.J.
and Piggie In The Morning.

13:06.560 --> 13:09.330
Ooh, there's a cozy-looking couple.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.640
Ho-ho! A little shy, I guess.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.500
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

13:15.510 --> 13:17.370
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Come on. Kiss her.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.910
Come on. Get it over with.

13:18.980 --> 13:22.709
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

13:22.710 --> 13:24.450
Craig was right. They're choking.

13:24.510 --> 13:26.750
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

13:31.020 --> 13:32.820
You guys, it's gonna be fine, okay?

13:32.890 --> 13:35.360
Just relax. They're gonna do it.

13:35.430 --> 13:36.666
Wait, what the hell is this now?!

13:36.690 --> 13:39.690
Uh-oh. Look who's on the prowl!

13:39.700 --> 13:41.760
Here comes a real stud, folks.

13:41.830 --> 13:44.570
It's M.C. Dunks. Go get 'em, Dunks!

13:46.640 --> 13:49.970
Looks like M.C. Dunks wants a smooch.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.780
Damn it, M.C. Dunks! Get away from them.

13:52.840 --> 13:56.580
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

13:56.650 --> 13:59.950
I said, "Get... away"!

14:01.450 --> 14:03.850
Oh!

14:03.920 --> 14:06.519
Aah! Help!

14:06.520 --> 14:07.648
Ohh! Oh, help! Oh!

14:07.673 --> 14:08.680
Oh! Oh, God.

14:08.705 --> 14:10.105
Oh. Aah! Hey, man.

14:10.130 --> 14:11.506
- What are you... What...
- Hey, you gotta help me.

14:11.530 --> 14:12.660
What are you talking about?!

14:12.685 --> 14:13.685
- Oh, my...
- Help me!

14:13.704 --> 14:14.704
- What? Stop!
- Please!

14:14.729 --> 14:16.300
- Aah!
- Oh!

14:19.400 --> 14:22.870
M.C. Dunks is dead.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.610
He's dead!

14:24.680 --> 14:26.010
They killed him.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.480
Murderers!

14:30.210 --> 14:33.080
- They're leaving the arena.
- It's over.

14:37.420 --> 14:38.620
Explain cows.

14:38.690 --> 14:39.936
I don't want to do this anymore.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.560
Tell Mom and Dad what a cow is.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.090
It's like a big dog you can drink from.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.430
And what's a dog?

14:45.500 --> 14:47.900
A small cow you can be friends with.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.300
Tell them about giraffes.

14:50.370 --> 14:52.570
What's a giraffe?

14:52.640 --> 14:54.369
It's just a tall dog with...

14:54.370 --> 14:55.970
Louder. Speak up.

14:56.040 --> 14:59.770
Tall dog with a leg for a neck.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.710
What is going on? What is happening?

15:01.780 --> 15:04.250
Are... Are these real animals?

15:04.310 --> 15:06.850
You made all these things?

15:06.920 --> 15:10.120
This is what you did with
the 4 grand we gave you?!

15:10.145 --> 15:11.165
T-T-That's it. I'm done.

15:11.190 --> 15:13.190
I-I'm not talking about this anymore.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.589
We're almost finished.

15:14.590 --> 15:17.460
Explain your pièce de résistance.

15:17.530 --> 15:18.860
Explain humans.

15:18.930 --> 15:21.060
Oh, come on, Ricky. Just stop it!

15:21.130 --> 15:22.199
You made your point.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.200
These creatures live on his planet.

15:24.270 --> 15:27.740
But only on the surface, because
he forgot to build the middle.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.940
So the inside is just fire.

15:30.010 --> 15:33.610
Anyway, these humans are born
nude... like, fully naked.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.009
He gave them no instructions,

15:35.010 --> 15:36.550
and they just do whatever they want.

15:36.610 --> 15:37.610
What do you mean?

15:37.611 --> 15:39.150
He gave them free will.

15:39.220 --> 15:42.220
Son, is this true?

15:42.290 --> 15:44.150
Why would you do that?

15:44.220 --> 15:46.090
I thought it would make them happy.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.690
I thought, with all that freedom,

15:47.760 --> 15:50.490
they... they could do great things.

15:52.030 --> 15:56.100
Instead, they... they
just mostly ended up...

15:56.170 --> 15:57.870
like me.

15:59.970 --> 16:01.600
Ah...

16:10.310 --> 16:14.649
It was supposed to be better.

16:26.430 --> 16:28.230
♪ Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket

16:28.300 --> 16:29.370
♪ You live on a shelf

16:29.430 --> 16:31.370
♪ One is wet, and one is dry

16:31.440 --> 16:33.299
♪ And you are both my friends

16:33.300 --> 16:35.500
♪ Mr. Mop and Mrs.... Hey.

16:35.510 --> 16:37.240
So, um...

16:37.310 --> 16:39.980
I'm sorry we put you in the cabinet.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.510
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.510
And, also, guys, I've
been thinking about it,

16:43.580 --> 16:45.110
and you're absolutely right.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.580
The Kiss Cam really is our best shot.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.990
- It failed.
- Oh.

16:52.060 --> 16:54.260
I mean, m-maybe it's not all bad.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.190
I mean, traumatic events
bring people together,

16:56.260 --> 16:58.390
so... so maybe Sam and
Laura can bond over this.

16:58.460 --> 17:00.400
Right? Maybe?

17:00.460 --> 17:04.470
That was horrible.

17:04.530 --> 17:05.670
Yeah.

17:05.740 --> 17:08.739
So, uh, I guess you want to go home now.

17:08.740 --> 17:10.609
What do you mean?

17:10.670 --> 17:12.739
Well, um, I don't know.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.339
Because you just said
that you were having

17:14.339 --> 17:16.540
a horrible time, so...
That's not what I said.

17:16.609 --> 17:18.549
Well, that's what it
sounded like you said.

17:18.550 --> 17:21.150
Okay, well, sounds like
you want to go home.

17:21.220 --> 17:22.819
What? What do you mean?

17:22.890 --> 17:25.349
Like, you're the one who keeps
talking about going home, so...

17:25.420 --> 17:26.596
Well, that's 'cause I-I was thinking

17:26.619 --> 17:28.089
that you wanted to go home.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.959
W-Well, I kind of do, now.

17:32.830 --> 17:35.760
Okay, fine. So, um...

17:35.830 --> 17:37.569
I'm going home.

17:37.570 --> 17:39.300
Okay, fine. Go home.

17:39.370 --> 17:41.040
I'll go home. We'll both go home.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.170
Okay.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.910
Good night.

17:45.980 --> 17:47.780
Okay.

17:47.850 --> 17:49.310
Bye.

17:58.060 --> 18:00.060
Goodbye.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.470
You know what?

18:12.540 --> 18:14.470
No. I'm not giving up.

18:14.540 --> 18:16.140
Son, it's a bad restaurant.

18:16.210 --> 18:18.340
I'm not talking about Lazy Susan's.

18:18.410 --> 18:20.540
I know my planet is weird.

18:20.610 --> 18:23.150
I mean, it's frozen
on the top and bottom,

18:23.210 --> 18:25.680
and the sky changes colors,

18:25.750 --> 18:27.950
and people, they don't
know what they're doing,

18:28.020 --> 18:29.219
and they mess up a lot.

18:29.220 --> 18:31.220
But I love it.

18:31.290 --> 18:34.090
And I'm proud of it.

18:34.160 --> 18:36.160
And, come on. Giraffes are cool.

18:36.230 --> 18:38.090
I mean, if you don't get giraffes,

18:38.160 --> 18:40.300
if you can't find the joy

18:40.360 --> 18:42.560
in a tall dog with a leg for a neck,

18:42.630 --> 18:44.570
then I feel sorry for you.

18:44.630 --> 18:47.239
I mean, you guys can
pick on me all you want.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.840
But don't pick on Earth.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.110
'Cause it's here to stay.

18:51.180 --> 18:52.639
I'm not gonna blow it up.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.510
You were gonna blow it up? Well, yeah.

18:54.580 --> 18:56.710
I got this whole gold-ball thing

18:56.780 --> 19:00.380
that is setting off this
asteroid that's coming to...

19:00.450 --> 19:03.250
You know what? It's over your head.

19:09.660 --> 19:12.130
How are we gonna fix this?

19:21.410 --> 19:24.010
Did someone order a miracle?

19:24.070 --> 19:25.410
The bet's off.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.740
I'm here to save the world.

19:30.150 --> 19:33.520
- O - Okay. Okay.

19:35.220 --> 19:37.350
- Oh, um, it's not gonna...
- Ah.

19:37.420 --> 19:39.289
Okay.

19:39.290 --> 19:41.889
- Ah.
- Ah! Aah.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.042
- Oh, no!
- Aah!

19:43.067 --> 19:44.067
- Don't hurt yourself.
- Stop it.

19:44.090 --> 19:46.360
That's just... Okay.

19:46.430 --> 19:47.630
Whew! Damn it. Rosie!

19:47.700 --> 19:50.008
It's sealed... permanently.

19:50.033 --> 19:51.040
Remember?

19:51.065 --> 19:52.299
Shit.

19:54.700 --> 19:55.800
Okay.

19:57.310 --> 19:59.140
Oh, how's this thing going?

20:07.980 --> 20:10.390
A basketball game became
a horror show tonight

20:10.450 --> 20:13.260
when a beloved mascot
died in screaming agony

20:13.320 --> 20:14.860
in front of hundreds of fans.

20:14.930 --> 20:18.460
James "M.C. Dunks"
Morowitz collapsed suddenly

20:18.530 --> 20:21.060
during tonight's game due
to what doctors diagnosed

20:21.130 --> 20:23.800
as an "explosive
rupture of the appendix."

20:23.870 --> 20:26.470
The mascot has already
been permanently retired,

20:26.540 --> 20:29.400
as psychologists believe
even seeing his image

20:29.470 --> 20:32.670
may trigger scarring flashbacks
for those unlucky enough

20:32.740 --> 20:34.940
