00:06.966 --> 00:09.673
(theme music playing )

00:27.236 --> 00:29.227
- ( whip cracks)
- Doctore: Switch!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.113
Switch.

00:42.335 --> 00:44.371
( cracks whip )
Switch.

00:48.674 --> 00:50.585
Crixus!

00:50.760 --> 00:52.751
Did you not hear my instruction?

00:52.929 --> 00:55.170
Apologies, Doctore.

00:55.348 --> 00:57.213
I did not mean to scare
the rabbit.

00:59.352 --> 01:01.684
The games of the magistrate
approach.

01:01.854 --> 01:05.062
Listen carefully
to my instruction,

01:05.233 --> 01:07.474
and every man chosen

01:07.652 --> 01:09.768
will see victory in the arena.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.401
Perhaps not every man.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.111
- ( laughter)
- Pietros.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.742
Save the water
for men who deserve it.

01:28.256 --> 01:32.795
Rain. By Jupiter's cock,
would you fucking rain?

01:34.595 --> 01:36.005
Lucretia:
What are you doing?

01:36.180 --> 01:37.716
Praying.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.505
Blaspheming.

01:39.684 --> 01:42.892
The two are narrowly separated
in these trying times.

01:43.062 --> 01:45.553
Perhaps the gap widens.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.892
More creditors
seeking action?

01:48.067 --> 01:50.649
Something of more cheerful note,
recently delivered.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.989
From Magistrate Calavius.

01:58.577 --> 02:01.740
He is coming here to personally
select men for his games.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.371
Games to appease the gods
and end the drought.

02:04.542 --> 02:07.500
The biggest games since Theokoles
bested 100 men in the arena.

02:07.670 --> 02:09.251
But why come himself?
Unless...

02:11.048 --> 02:13.004
The primus.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.166
If we were to secure the main event
at these games...

02:15.344 --> 02:17.551
He arrives within the hour.

02:19.432 --> 02:21.764
Prepare food.
And gather all the water we have.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.471
- Quintus, your robe.
- It's nothing.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.101
Fetch the medicus.

02:26.272 --> 02:27.762
Lucretia.

02:29.692 --> 02:31.978
I should talk to the magistrate
about it.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.644
Those men tried to kill you--
an honest man.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.028
In a dishonest place.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.940
No, we won't concern the Magistrate
with these things,

02:39.118 --> 02:41.609
not with the primus
in the balance.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.620
l'll tend to the matter myself.

02:49.962 --> 02:53.955
That was the mark of one of the slaves
who tried to kill Batiatus.

02:57.136 --> 02:59.343
The mark is unknown to me.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.719
Perhaps a closer look.

03:03.184 --> 03:07.803
Details of such craftsmanship
should not be viewed in haste.

03:11.317 --> 03:14.809
I may have seen
a similar mark.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.488
Ahh.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.397
So what do you think?

03:19.575 --> 03:22.157
You adorn them like a god.

03:22.328 --> 03:26.537
I would be out of them
and deep into you.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.325
Apologies.
Magistrate Calavius arrives.

03:30.503 --> 03:32.209
Our fortunes rise

03:32.380 --> 03:33.961
like your cock.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.622
Stay wet and we'll make it rain
presently.

03:36.801 --> 03:38.837
( groans )

03:42.056 --> 03:43.671
Magistrate,

03:43.849 --> 03:47.182
you do us honor with your...

03:47.353 --> 03:48.513
presence.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.348
Good Batiatus,
l was telling Solonius

03:50.523 --> 03:52.184
howl knew your father.

03:52.358 --> 03:54.474
Now there was a true Roman.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.188
A great man,

03:56.362 --> 03:58.694
none of his like to follow.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.071
I will attempt to fill your needs
as he would have.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.857
To business then.

04:04.870 --> 04:05.985
Magistrate:
As you well know,

04:06.163 --> 04:08.449
the drought has parched the city
to the point of madness.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.831
We've tried everything
to tempt the sky into tears,

04:11.001 --> 04:13.538
even to the point
of a hecatomb.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.203
100 cattle sacrificed,
yet not a drop,

04:16.382 --> 04:18.043
because the gods do not want
the blood of cattle.

04:18.217 --> 04:19.502
They want the blood of men.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.542
Good Solonius has been
kind enough to lend a hand

04:21.720 --> 04:24.257
in organizing games
to appease their appetite.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.047
It will be sine missione--

04:26.225 --> 04:28.386
no draw, no mercy shown.

04:28.561 --> 04:31.769
Only the finest gladiators
will be invited to participate.

04:31.939 --> 04:36.228
Only the finest are offered
in the house of Batiatus.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.893
Come, examine my wares.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.117
An impressive selection,

04:47.288 --> 04:49.825
rivaling that
of good Solonius himself.

04:49.999 --> 04:52.081
Yet l have the primus.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.491
Half,

04:53.669 --> 04:55.250
your opponent
still to be chosen.

04:55.421 --> 04:57.207
Batiatus: If you wish
to appease the gods,

04:57.381 --> 04:59.588
you must have one
upon the sands.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.965
Crixus, the champion of Capua,

05:02.136 --> 05:04.923
will willingly fight anyone
that Solonius has to offer.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.257
ExceHent

05:06.432 --> 05:08.639
It will truly be
a contest between legends.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.634
Legends?

05:12.813 --> 05:15.520
Oh, did I fail to mention?

05:15.691 --> 05:18.478
Good Solonius has secured
Theokoles for the primus.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.903
Theokoles?

05:20.070 --> 05:23.437
Solonius: I managed to coax him
to our fair city at great expense.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.356
With our gratitude.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.775
If the gods fail to grant us rain
with such a tribute,

05:27.953 --> 05:29.659
then we are surely cursed.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.492
I fear the gods will be displeased.
The match is unbalanced.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.749
Only one man has ever
stood against Theokoles and lived.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.712
What if Crixus were joined
by your man Spartacus?

05:40.883 --> 05:43.215
His death was fated in execution,

05:43.385 --> 05:45.467
yet he refused to own it

05:45.638 --> 05:48.880
and cost me four men
in his defiance.

05:49.058 --> 05:52.300
Your debts are well-known,
Batiatus.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.764
Even if you lose the men,
the purse is enough

05:54.939 --> 05:58.022
to hold off your creditors
for a moment.

05:58.192 --> 06:01.025
Unless of course you would rather
sit out these games

06:01.195 --> 06:02.810
or any others that follow,
which--

06:02.988 --> 06:05.104
No, I will set my men
to the task.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.201
My titans!

06:15.376 --> 06:17.537
Pause and hear glorious news.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.499
Magistrate Titus Calavius

06:21.674 --> 06:25.667
has invited our best men
to fight in his primus.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.335
Crixus, step forward.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.257
Spartacus, step forward.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.607
You have been chosen
to fight as one

06:41.777 --> 06:43.688
against Theokoles,

06:43.862 --> 06:46.353
The Shadow of Death.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.707
Fuck! Ow! Ow!

06:58.877 --> 07:00.617
Fuck. Shit. Fuck.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.957
Ow. Ow. Shit.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.373
Fuck. Ow.

07:10.723 --> 07:13.260
I think you two will make
a fine couple.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.635
I'd rather fight without him.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.314
And die the same.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.518
This Theokoles--

07:22.693 --> 07:24.729
the legends can't be true.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.235
He's been cut a thousand times
in the arena.

07:27.406 --> 07:30.398
He's never fallen.

07:30.576 --> 07:33.158
I fear you would have been safer
in the pits.

07:33.329 --> 07:36.036
If we were to win,

07:36.206 --> 07:38.333
how large would be the purse?

07:38.500 --> 07:42.288
Large enough to wrest
10 wives from the Syrian.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.382
Doctore: You send them to certain death.
Let me fight in their stead.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.092
Lucretia: That's an excellent
suggesﬁon.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.473
- I owe Theokoles a debt of pain.
- You were not requested.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.600
Look, no one has forgotten
how bravely you fought

07:58.771 --> 08:00.887
- against Theokoles, old friend.
- Yet without victory.

08:01.065 --> 08:03.681
You stand the only man
to face him in the arena and live.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.520
That in itself is a victory.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.771
Set your purpose to the task of training
Crixus and Spartacus for the match.

08:09.948 --> 08:13.315
I fear no amount will save them
from The Shadow's grasp.

08:13.494 --> 08:16.452
Then prepare them
for a glorious death.

08:22.795 --> 08:24.410
The brand belonged
to Remus,

08:24.588 --> 08:26.624
a slave trader
plying wares north of the city.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.790
Remus? The name holds
no recognition.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.128
Nor to l. Yet, if I were
to purchase a slave,

08:31.303 --> 08:32.964
intent on foul designs...

08:33.138 --> 08:35.129
Then it would be
from outside Capua,

08:35.307 --> 08:37.514
to avoid simple discovery.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.846
Find Remus and bring him.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.760
I would have conversation.

08:41.939 --> 08:43.895
Dominus.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.483
Water.

08:58.163 --> 09:01.280
From Domina,
to help with your training.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.424
Wait a moment.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.881
To what purpose?

09:19.935 --> 09:22.847
Need there be one?

09:25.023 --> 09:27.685
You shouldn't look at me
in that way.

09:27.860 --> 09:31.569
I try with all my strength
not to.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.355
But I am weak.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.953
Sleep then.

09:42.124 --> 09:44.661
And regain your strength.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.589
I seek no quarrel.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.504
Your presence here
would state otherwise.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.388
We've had our differences.

10:00.559 --> 10:03.050
I own my part in them.
Yet if we are to defeat Theokoles--

10:03.228 --> 10:04.729
We?

10:04.897 --> 10:07.388
There is no such thing
in the arena.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.682
You believe

10:09.860 --> 10:12.567
you can slay the giant alone?

10:12.738 --> 10:14.945
As | always stand.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.275
This time you do not.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.236
When Theokoles falls,

10:18.410 --> 10:20.492
the glory will be mine.

10:20.662 --> 10:24.655
And if we do not come
to common ground,

10:24.833 --> 10:26.744
the death shared
will be ours.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.432
Oh, as if they stand a chance
against Theokoles.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.593
Perhaps the gods
will favor them.

10:45.771 --> 10:48.638
Yes, and perhaps I should
sprout wings and flutter off.

10:48.816 --> 10:52.058
The odds lay a thousand to one
against them.

10:52.236 --> 10:55.694
No man has ever won
betting against Crixus.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.355
I would lay coin
towards their victory.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.785
A fool's wager, happily received.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.959
- You leave without words?
- None to give.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.461
Each time you step
beyond these walls,

11:13.632 --> 11:15.372
I fear for you and what--

11:15.551 --> 11:17.291
Grab hold of your cock
and be a man.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.304
I do what I must, Pietros.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.466
l'll return soon.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.402
Mind the birds.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.318
Pietros, weapons.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.252
- ||ithyia?
- She comes at my invitation.

11:54.423 --> 11:57.210
Now's not the time to be entertaining
that spoiled little bitch.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.500
Her father Albinius
holds the magistrate's ear.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.795
If he were to place a word in it, then
Crixus may be replaced in the primus.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.009
He could place a thousand
and to no result.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.515
Solonius maneuvered you.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.517
With the aid of the magistrate.
Refuse and

12:09.688 --> 12:12.555
we would quickly find ourselves
excluded from the arena altogether.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.974
And if Crixus falls?
Who will be our champion?

12:15.152 --> 12:17.313
Who will the crowds clamor to see
from the house of Batiatus?

12:17.487 --> 12:19.398
Not Spartacus,
that thing from the pits?

12:19.573 --> 12:20.983
( door opens)

12:22.367 --> 12:25.700
Your guest arrives.
Do not broach the subject with her.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.742
||ithyia, you do us honor
with your presence.

12:29.917 --> 12:33.205
I would trade honor
for water.

12:35.881 --> 12:39.499
Oh, the heat is a thing living,
crawling down the throat.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.712
Well, let us quench that thirst.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.718
I must attend
the business of the games.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.880
I leave you in loving hands.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.141
- Is it true then?
- What?

12:49.311 --> 12:52.519
Crixus and Spartacus
face The Shadow of Death?

12:52.689 --> 12:54.645
They do.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.102
Blood will surely flow
on the day.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.940
I long to see it pour
from the Thracian.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.792
Doctore:
You attack as you would a man.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.580
Theokoles is beyond flesh,

13:19.758 --> 13:22.295
beyond blood and bone.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.632
He is the shadow
that precedes death.

13:25.806 --> 13:29.469
Allow him
to fall upon you alone,

13:29.643 --> 13:31.258
and you are dead.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.596
Now rise,

13:32.771 --> 13:35.387
and come at me as one!

13:37.901 --> 13:40.017
Give way, you fuck.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.435
The advantage was mine.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.957
How Crixus moves.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.373
The way his muscles
catch the sun.

14:07.305 --> 14:10.297
Truly the champion of Capua.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.215
None his equal.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.970
You jostle and trip over the other
like fools.

14:17.149 --> 14:19.686
You face Theokoles
in the primus!

14:21.695 --> 14:24.027
Prove yourselves worthy!

14:42.424 --> 14:44.255
Pathetic.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.168
I crave a closer look.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.472
Can we go down
among them?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.852
My husband
would never allow it.

14:58.023 --> 15:01.857
The bowels of a ludus are no place
for a senator's daughter.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.814
A private viewing then,
in the villa?

15:04.988 --> 15:07.900
I would pay for it, of course.

15:08.075 --> 15:12.034
A favor amongst friends.

15:12.204 --> 15:15.037
You must let me
return it then.

15:15.207 --> 15:17.539
I've given thought
to your problem

15:17.709 --> 15:19.950
and have discovered
a solution.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.460
Problem?

15:22.631 --> 15:24.542
Children.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.835
Yes?

15:27.010 --> 15:30.127
I've heard of a woman,
a priestess of Juno,

15:30.305 --> 15:33.012
blessed with certain gifts
of fertility.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.344
Many prominent women
speak of her--

15:35.519 --> 15:38.852
Servillia, Cornelia, Laelia.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.387
Ovidius's wife?

15:40.565 --> 15:42.066
You know her?

15:42.234 --> 15:44.099
Oh, in passing.
She has a small boy.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.861
And would have none, if not touched
by the woman I speak of.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.738
Will you let me
arrange it for you

15:50.909 --> 15:54.401
as a gift
for your hospitality?

15:59.584 --> 16:01.415
We are friends, aren't we?

16:01.586 --> 16:03.702
The very best.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.800
How are we to fare
against Theokoles

16:10.971 --> 16:13.428
when we cannot even
best Doctore?

16:13.598 --> 16:15.463
I could have bested him
a dozen times

16:15.642 --> 16:17.303
if you'd not gotten underfoot.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.934
I take the sands beside you
in this fight, Crixus.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.391
Just because you stand beside me
with sword and shield,

16:22.566 --> 16:24.978
do not mistake yourself
as a gladiator.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.484
I fight to honor these walls.
You fight to leave them.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.817
You fight

16:30.991 --> 16:33.448
because you are a slave

16:33.618 --> 16:34.994
like me.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.278
No. Not like you.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.662
I accept my place here.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.198
I embrace it.

16:41.376 --> 16:42.661
Butyoun

16:42.836 --> 16:45.077
you still dream of a life
beyond the arena

16:45.255 --> 16:47.041
where that wife of yours
we've all heard about

16:47.215 --> 16:49.171
is still nestled by your side.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.550
And that is all it is, Spartacus--
a dream.

16:52.721 --> 16:55.679
And one day soon you will awaken
to the truth.

16:56.933 --> 17:00.050
You will never leave this place.

17:00.228 --> 17:03.561
And your wife,
if she's not dead already,

17:03.732 --> 17:06.849
has been fucked to madness
by a hundred Roman cocks.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.169
Get yourselves cleaned up.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.335
Domina requests your presence,

17:34.512 --> 17:36.503
both of you.

17:48.652 --> 17:52.520
Do you know who lam,
Thracian?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.907
Speak.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.403
l have seen you

18:01.581 --> 18:04.789
with Legatus Glaber.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.747
I am his wife.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.499
He is regrettably abroad

18:13.677 --> 18:15.338
and will not be able
to witness

18:15.512 --> 18:17.719
your death
against Theokoles.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.723
But...

18:26.189 --> 18:29.773
I shall whisper of it to him,

18:29.943 --> 18:33.777
replaying the moment

18:33.947 --> 18:37.235
when we are entwined
in our bed.

18:43.999 --> 18:46.991
Apologies. I require the Thracian
for a moment.

18:47.168 --> 18:50.581
Extend it by a lifetime.
I am done with him.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.746
(snaps fingers)
My office.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.093
The champion of Capua--

18:59.264 --> 19:01.676
a rare honor to receive
a private audience.

19:01.850 --> 19:05.388
One I am most appreciative of.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.427
Although

19:07.605 --> 19:09.470
he does seem

19:09.649 --> 19:14.268
a touch overd ressed
for the occasion.

19:14.446 --> 19:17.188
Yoursungaﬁan
remove it.

19:26.333 --> 19:30.451
Your champion
is bold to his purpose.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.664
I take my leave.

19:54.152 --> 19:57.360
His flesh is hard.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.371
Like marble.

20:15.256 --> 20:20.000
Would that every man
were carved so.

20:22.514 --> 20:24.345
We'd best not keep him.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.758
His training resumes
at first light.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.552
Do you think he will survive
against The Shadow?

20:32.190 --> 20:35.808
Only the gods know.

20:35.985 --> 20:40.524
It would be a pity
to see such a man marred.

20:48.915 --> 20:53.079
Perhaps there is a way
to see such a tragedy averted.

20:54.879 --> 20:58.622
If your father were
to speak to the magistrate perhaps...

20:58.800 --> 21:00.586
To what end?

21:02.053 --> 21:04.430
To seeing Crixus
replaced in the games.

21:06.975 --> 21:09.591
Is that what you want?

21:09.769 --> 21:13.136
Do you fear entering the arena
with Theokoles?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.642
I long for it.

21:23.491 --> 21:26.073
As I long to see it.

21:31.249 --> 21:33.581
Batiatus: You survived being dragged
from your homeland

21:33.751 --> 21:37.960
by Legatus Glaber.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.713
You survived execution
by four gladiators in the arena.

21:40.884 --> 21:43.296
You even survived
the horror of the pits.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.976
Can you survive this?

21:54.522 --> 21:56.683
Crixus and I fight
at cross purposes.

21:56.858 --> 21:59.770
Then find a way
to unite them.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.609
You may have saved my life,

22:02.780 --> 22:04.907
but yours is yet worth little
in the arena.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.689
But to lose Crixus
along with you--

22:06.868 --> 22:10.611
that would be a blow from which
this ludus would not recover.

22:10.788 --> 22:13.279
My concern is only
for my wife.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.289
And her fate is tied
to these walls.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.997
If they collapse around me,
then lwill be unable to help her

22:18.171 --> 22:20.127
from beneath the rubble.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.798
I will not die
until she is safe.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.629
Well, prove it so.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.634
Fight as one with Crixus
to best Theokoles

22:27.805 --> 22:30.387
or we are all fucked.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.674
Yes?

22:37.482 --> 22:40.599
Barca has returned
bearing gifts.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.903
Remove him to the barracks.

22:56.668 --> 23:00.126
Two slaves
broken by your hand

23:00.296 --> 23:02.412
made attempt on my life.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.000
Who purchased them?

23:04.175 --> 23:05.551
I know not of what you speak.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.095
I speak of being fucked

23:08.263 --> 23:10.174
by the gods, by the magistrate,

23:10.348 --> 23:12.339
by that cocksuck Solonius

23:12.517 --> 23:14.633
and his grinning schemes.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.847
l'm of proud family,

23:17.021 --> 23:19.012
a family of means and history,

23:19.190 --> 23:22.603
you fucking cunt.

23:22.777 --> 23:24.017
You sold the men,

23:24.195 --> 23:26.652
common slaves

23:26.823 --> 23:28.654
who tried to kill me,

23:28.825 --> 23:31.191
tried to fuck me like a whore.

23:31.369 --> 23:34.031
But I will not be fucked.

23:34.205 --> 23:36.366
I will not-- not be fucked,

23:36.541 --> 23:38.907
you fuck,
you fucking cocksucking

23:39.085 --> 23:41.201
you fucking
hemorrhoid sucking fuck,

23:41.379 --> 23:43.415
you fuck.

23:49.721 --> 23:50.927
Ovidius.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.553
What?

23:52.724 --> 23:54.214
Ovidius.

23:54.392 --> 23:58.886
Sold to Ovidius.

24:01.649 --> 24:04.732
There. Was that
so fucking hard?

24:07.280 --> 24:08.986
He could be cousin
to Jupiter himself.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.818
I don't give a shit.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.983
I will have satisfaction.

24:14.996 --> 24:17.032
You dishonor me.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.367
The Thracian impedes
my attack.

24:19.542 --> 24:22.249
- I seek to strengthen it.
- I seek no aid.

24:22.420 --> 24:23.705
No.

24:23.880 --> 24:27.418
You need the gods to descend
and fight by your side.

24:27.592 --> 24:29.924
Even then victory is doubtful.

24:33.222 --> 24:36.214
Words falling on deaf ears.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.266
Attend your eyes then.

24:52.116 --> 24:54.778
My failure--

24:54.952 --> 24:56.943
your lesson.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.542
His first cut...

25:06.255 --> 25:08.667
dealt when I thought him
vulnerable

25:08.841 --> 25:11.958
and pressed my attack
unwisely.

25:15.473 --> 25:17.464
His next assault

25:17.642 --> 25:19.758
came as I fell back

25:19.936 --> 25:22.393
to regain position.

25:25.149 --> 25:28.858
Yet these wounds are nothing--

25:29.904 --> 25:31.860
a game of blood
to amuse the crowd.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.987
And when he tires of playing,

25:34.158 --> 25:36.319
he will move

25:36.494 --> 25:38.655
to separate your head

25:38.830 --> 25:40.912
from your neck.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.708
| live because I survived longer

25:45.878 --> 25:48.290
than any man
that stood against him.

25:48.464 --> 25:51.672
Some herald that
as a victory.

25:51.843 --> 25:55.051
lam not among them.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.259
You tell us
The Shadow wounds

25:58.433 --> 26:00.424
both when he is pressed
and when he is given ground.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.853
How will he to be defeated?

26:03.020 --> 26:05.636
By accomplishing
both at once.

26:05.815 --> 26:08.898
Press and defend;

26:09.068 --> 26:11.445
Distract and strike;

26:11.612 --> 26:15.104
Fight as one

26:15.283 --> 26:18.116
or die as two.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.914
Now

26:30.089 --> 26:32.466
show me the way to honor.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.014
The game's tomorrow,
and yet he presses them.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.389
To their benefit.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.555
l have business in town.

26:45.730 --> 26:48.062
It'll take me
until late into the night.

26:49.901 --> 26:51.562
- Lucretia.
-Hmm?

26:51.736 --> 26:52.976
Business.

26:53.154 --> 26:55.941
Yeah, business.
I heard you.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.492
If YOU W0uld prefer I delay-—

26:59.911 --> 27:02.243
No, l have diversion.

27:02.413 --> 27:05.120
||ithyia's coming
with her priestess.

27:10.880 --> 27:14.247
May the gods
grant us miracle.

27:14.425 --> 27:16.290
They fucking owe us
something.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.984
A word of advice, Spartacus.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.898
(Ashur sighs)

27:41.077 --> 27:42.613
At what cost?

27:42.787 --> 27:44.027
Freely given.

27:44.205 --> 27:47.288
Do not think you can come
to terms with Crixus.

27:47.458 --> 27:50.370
I trusted him once
in the arena

27:50.545 --> 27:53.252
and this was the result.

27:54.257 --> 27:57.340
He may as well have cut
the balls from my shaft.

28:00.137 --> 28:01.923
He'd turn a sword
against his ally?

28:02.098 --> 28:05.431
Even Barca, if stood
between him and glory.

28:05.601 --> 28:09.014
The only way to survive
against Theokoles

28:09.188 --> 28:12.976
is to consider Crixus
an equal enemy.

28:39.343 --> 28:41.595
How often do you engage
in intercourse?

28:43.347 --> 28:46.430
Several times a week,
sometimes more.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.717
Has seed ever taken hold?

28:48.895 --> 28:51.227
Neven

28:52.857 --> 28:56.020
Have there been other men
besides your husband?

28:59.864 --> 29:02.025
What bearing does that have?

29:02.199 --> 29:05.862
Well, it will inform the correct
combination of elements.

29:06.037 --> 29:08.904
The ritual is usually
a private matter. Perhaps...

29:09.081 --> 29:11.868
Oh please, can I stay?

29:12.043 --> 29:14.534
I've never seen one of these.

29:14.712 --> 29:16.373
It's so intriguing.

29:20.176 --> 29:21.416
Other men--

29:21.594 --> 29:23.550
have there been any?

29:25.139 --> 29:27.721
Yes.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.428
How many?

29:29.602 --> 29:32.264
One, but frequently.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.100
Then the difficulty lies not
with the seed

29:35.274 --> 29:36.889
but within the vessel.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.527
You mean there's
something wrong with her?

29:42.698 --> 29:45.906
The gods have decided to withhold
the joy of children.

29:46.077 --> 29:48.568
But we will entreat them
to reconsider.

29:56.545 --> 29:59.457
(speaking in Latin )

30:08.975 --> 30:10.806
Drink.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.646
Juno has blessed you.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.152
You must copulate
within the hour.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.607
So soon?

30:24.782 --> 30:26.773
Before the flame of life expires.

30:29.203 --> 30:31.569
Good fortune be with you.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.375
Only an hour?

30:42.550 --> 30:44.882
You think she would have told you that
before she started,

30:45.052 --> 30:46.917
considering her price.

30:47.096 --> 30:48.381
Gratitude for arranging this.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.763
Unnecessary words
from a friend.

30:50.933 --> 30:53.140
And I being yours,

30:53.310 --> 30:56.017
I'll leave you
to complete the ritual.

30:56.188 --> 31:00.056
Although tales of this
other man

31:00.234 --> 31:03.601
will be most expected
when time is not of issue.

31:08.993 --> 31:11.405
Why are the fucking torches
not lit?

31:11.579 --> 31:14.036
Laelia.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.799
I owe you a debt, Ovidius,

31:34.977 --> 31:36.842
I've come to repay.

31:40.608 --> 31:43.145
Please.

31:43.319 --> 31:45.685
The boy is unstained.

31:47.907 --> 31:51.399
No child is unstained
by the deeds of his father.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.533
They are not my own.

31:53.704 --> 31:56.241
Two slaves sent from Remus
to take my life.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.828
Do you deny giving coin
to the cause?

32:00.002 --> 32:01.708
I hired the men, yes,

32:01.879 --> 32:03.790
but to another's purpose.

32:03.964 --> 32:05.374
Whose?

32:09.887 --> 32:11.047
Whose?

32:13.015 --> 32:16.382
Speak the name and I swear to the gods
|wi|| not kill you.

32:19.855 --> 32:22.016
Solonius.

32:22.191 --> 32:25.649
He paid the balance
of your debt to me

32:25.820 --> 32:29.779
in exchange for me
arranging your death.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.450
Gratitude for your honesty,
Ovidius.

32:36.914 --> 32:39.246
You're not going to
kill me then?

32:39.416 --> 32:41.498
No.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.547
My slave is going to kill you.

33:03.399 --> 33:06.015
Burn this fucking place
to the ground.

33:07.069 --> 33:09.025
But first

33:09.196 --> 33:11.528
take care of the child.

33:19.957 --> 33:22.664
You were right.

33:22.835 --> 33:25.702
I do not honor these walls.

33:26.714 --> 33:29.581
A fact well known.

33:30.634 --> 33:33.171
Has it always been so for you?

33:34.805 --> 33:37.296
When you were brought here
for the first time

33:37.474 --> 33:39.465
against your will,

33:39.643 --> 33:41.850
your life

33:42.021 --> 33:44.478
traded for a few coins?

33:44.648 --> 33:46.980
More than a few.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.527
Is that your worth then?

33:56.285 --> 33:59.277
Has it ever occurred to you
why the great Theokoles

33:59.455 --> 34:01.571
would grace us
with his presence?

34:02.833 --> 34:05.540
A promise of wealth.

34:08.172 --> 34:10.754
The Shadow has earned
a thousand fortunes.

34:10.925 --> 34:13.837
He comes here not for coin.

34:14.011 --> 34:16.047
He comes here for the glory

34:16.222 --> 34:19.464
of facing the champion of Capua,

34:19.642 --> 34:21.849
the undefeated Gaul.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.803
Glory.

34:25.981 --> 34:29.098
There is no greater thing

34:29.276 --> 34:31.858
than standing victorious
in the arena.

34:33.489 --> 34:35.730
Is there no purpose

34:35.908 --> 34:38.194
beyond the blood,

34:38.369 --> 34:40.200
no dream

34:40.371 --> 34:42.327
beyond the cheering crowd?

34:42.498 --> 34:45.786
Is there nothing else you fight for?

34:47.503 --> 34:50.210
Crixus, you are summoned.

35:15.406 --> 35:17.988
Step into the light.

35:20.202 --> 35:24.161
Let me gaze upon
the champion of Capua.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.867
You truly are a wonder.

35:29.044 --> 35:32.377
As are you, Domina.

35:33.424 --> 35:35.585
We don't have much time

35:35.759 --> 35:38.501
and I would see it well used.

35:41.265 --> 35:43.972
Do | stir you to passion?

35:44.143 --> 35:46.429
Yes, Domina.

35:50.941 --> 35:53.182
Your cock would disagree.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.271
Excuse my distraction, Domina.

35:55.446 --> 35:57.277
l have thoughts of tomorrow.

35:59.491 --> 36:03.359
And lwould have you
in the moment

36:03.537 --> 36:06.574
deep inside me.

36:07.583 --> 36:10.791
I've never faced an opponent
like Theokoles.

36:10.961 --> 36:15.125
And he has never met
a man like you.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.924
I beg a favor, Domina.

36:23.098 --> 36:26.181
Love makes a man weak
before battle.

36:41.784 --> 36:44.321
I would have you strong.

36:46.205 --> 36:49.868
We will forgo the pleasures
of a single evening

36:50.042 --> 36:52.829
and pray to the gods
for many more to come.

37:00.761 --> 37:02.752
Domina.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.981
(crying)

37:30.124 --> 37:32.206
You are going to die tomorrow,
aren't you?

37:34.044 --> 37:36.751
Only the gods
divine the future.

37:38.465 --> 37:41.298
Why didn't you let ||ithyia
help you?

37:41.468 --> 37:43.754
She could have spoken
to her father.

37:43.929 --> 37:46.045
To what end?

37:47.558 --> 37:49.549
Humiliation?

37:51.603 --> 37:54.470
Honor and glory--

37:54.648 --> 37:57.310
that's all you care about,
isn't it?

38:06.410 --> 38:08.275
Not all.

38:14.710 --> 38:17.076
Still a fool.

38:19.423 --> 38:21.414
Still.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.012
You said love drains a man.

38:33.061 --> 38:36.098
It can give him hope

38:36.273 --> 38:38.264
in the right arms.

38:57.211 --> 38:59.873
The odds do not favor you.

39:00.047 --> 39:03.084
They seldom do.

39:04.301 --> 39:07.543
I've heard Barca has laid
a large amount of coin on you.

39:07.721 --> 39:10.178
More towards Crixus, but still...

39:10.349 --> 39:12.806
And you?

39:15.020 --> 39:18.057
If I had the means,

39:18.232 --> 39:21.395
I would wager all with Barca.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.854
You're too fucking stubborn
to die.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.862
( chuckles )

39:27.032 --> 39:29.739
Every man has his end.

39:29.910 --> 39:33.778
I pray to the gods
you have not yet reached yours.

39:37.501 --> 39:41.619
If they do not answer,

39:41.797 --> 39:43.879
I would ask a thing of you.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.215
I will do everything I can
to find her.

39:52.349 --> 39:54.681
Now sleep.

39:54.851 --> 39:57.342
Tomorrow you face a legend

39:57.521 --> 40:00.228
and may yet
become one yourself.

40:14.204 --> 40:16.581
( crowd cheering )

40:22.337 --> 40:23.668
Did you see it?

40:23.839 --> 40:25.545
Septimus-- the victor, as I said.

40:25.716 --> 40:29.584
Valerius always drops his shield
when he attacks--

40:29.761 --> 40:31.752
a disadvantage
against the spear.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.545
The boy has a keen eye.

40:33.724 --> 40:36.716
Towards gladiators, yes.
His studies are another matter.

40:45.986 --> 40:48.068
My hour of glory is long past.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.696
Yours stands before you.

40:51.867 --> 40:55.451
Heal old wounds.

40:55.621 --> 40:58.738
Kill that fucking son of a whore.

41:05.005 --> 41:07.087
Finally the primus.

41:07.257 --> 41:10.169
Another moment
and my tongue would turn to dust.

41:10.344 --> 41:12.175
Water.

41:12.346 --> 41:14.007
Apologies, Domina.

41:14.181 --> 41:16.092
We've used our last.

41:16.266 --> 41:19.303
Please share some of mine.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.469
You're too kind,
good Solonius.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.933
You'd do the same
if you were able.

41:24.107 --> 41:26.098
No matter.

41:26.276 --> 41:28.767
Soon Theokoles will honor the gods
with blood,

41:28.945 --> 41:32.073
and they in turn will bless us
with endless rain.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.447
I pray for the truth in it.

41:34.618 --> 41:36.700
This drought
is driving the city mad.

41:36.870 --> 41:39.828
Unfortunate word has reached us
that our dearest cousin Ovidius

41:39.998 --> 41:42.489
was murdered in his home.

41:45.253 --> 41:46.584
Ovidius?

41:46.755 --> 41:48.461
||ithyia: No.

41:48.632 --> 41:51.749
I mentioned his wife
not a night ago.

41:51.927 --> 41:53.337
What of his son?

41:53.512 --> 41:55.343
He was so young.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.300
Magistrate: Their villa was burnt,

41:57.474 --> 41:59.760
only a few bodies yet recovered.

41:59.935 --> 42:03.052
I fear the boy
is among the ruins.

42:03.230 --> 42:05.391
A tragedy.

42:05.565 --> 42:09.478
One cannot but wonder
what might prompt such an act.

42:12.906 --> 42:15.147
Magistrate: Let us turn our minds
to thoughts of rain

42:15.325 --> 42:17.441
to cool the fevered brow
ofourcﬂy.

42:19.996 --> 42:23.124
Citizens of Capua,

42:23.291 --> 42:27.910
brothers of Rome,

42:28.088 --> 42:30.670
in the name of my forefathers,

42:30.841 --> 42:33.048
l, Titus Calavius,

42:33.218 --> 42:36.506
present to you the final event,

42:36.680 --> 42:38.887
- a spectacle...
- Your woman--

42:39.057 --> 42:41.673
- ...of blood and death...
- --is she the reason you refuse to die?

42:41.852 --> 42:44.059
Magistrate:
...a sacrifice to Ceres...

42:44.229 --> 42:45.389
Spartacus: She is.

42:45.564 --> 42:47.520
...the great goddess of renewal.
May her lips...

42:47.691 --> 42:49.807
Then perhaps there is something
beyond glory.

42:49.985 --> 42:52.897
Magistrate: ...then shower us
with an ocean of rain.

42:53.071 --> 42:54.686
From the house

42:54.865 --> 42:58.653
of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus,

42:58.827 --> 43:04.038
behold Spartacus Thraex...

43:04.207 --> 43:06.368
( crowd booing )

43:10.464 --> 43:12.705
...joined in battle today

43:12.883 --> 43:15.465
by the undefeated Gaul...

43:15.635 --> 43:18.718
- ( cheering )
- ...the champion of Capua!

43:18.889 --> 43:23.974
Behold Crixus murmillo!

43:28.565 --> 43:31.432
Crixus! Crixus! Crixus!

43:34.696 --> 43:37.028
Capua!

43:40.410 --> 43:42.241
Shall we begin?

43:53.799 --> 43:56.916
Together they stand

43:57.093 --> 44:00.005
against a man
who has never fallen,

44:00.180 --> 44:03.172
a beast that has never
been tamed,

44:03.350 --> 44:07.764
alegend
that has never been tarnished.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.845
By the grace

44:11.024 --> 44:15.313
of Marcus Decius Solonius,

44:15.487 --> 44:18.479
behold Theokoles,

44:18.657 --> 44:21.069
The Shadow of Death!

44:51.022 --> 44:53.513
(crowd murmuring)

45:20.260 --> 45:22.251
(yelling)

45:24.431 --> 45:25.546
Begin.

45:43.450 --> 45:44.610
They draw blood.

46:42.258 --> 46:43.543
Yes!

46:43.718 --> 46:45.925
Yes! ( laughs)

47:04.489 --> 47:06.901
( crowd cheering )

47:32.684 --> 47:34.265
Yeah!

47:34.436 --> 47:36.643
Yeah, Capua!

48:00.003 --> 48:04.121
Capua, shall I begin?

48:04.299 --> 48:06.005
(thunder crashing )

48:17.062 --> 48:18.427
Get out of the way.

48:25.570 --> 48:28.858
Give ground
or I'll kill you myself.

48:32.660 --> 48:34.196
- ( screams )
-(gaspS)

50:02.792 --> 50:05.249
Theokoles!

51:05.438 --> 51:08.225
Crowd:
Kill! Kill! Kill!

51:08.399 --> 51:10.560
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

51:10.735 --> 51:14.023
(screaming )

51:19.244 --> 51:20.529
Yes!

51:36.552 --> 51:38.964
(thunder rumbling)

52:58.092 --> 53:02.631
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!

53:02.805 --> 53:05.842
( crowd continues chanting )

53:23.993 --> 53:26.325
(theme music playing )
