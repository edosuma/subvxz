WEBVTT

00:12.160 --> 00:14.320
Oh, wow, Catherine.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.040
-Ah! -That looks amazing.

00:17.080 --> 00:20.440
Thank you, J.P. But where's Humphrey?

00:20.480 --> 00:22.800
Let's not worry about him, he's always late.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.960
I suggest we get stuck in.

00:33.400 --> 00:37.600
Hey, Bumba! Don't tell me you managed to sell

00:33.400 --> 00:37.600
that old rustbucket.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.760
Bumba Dupuis, he's been trying to sell that old boat

00:40.840 --> 00:44.760
as long as I've known him.

00:44.800 --> 00:49.640
So, go on, now. What idiot did you trick into

00:44.800 --> 00:49.640
buying her

00:51.600 --> 00:52.760
Ahoy there!

00:54.160 --> 00:55.480
Look what I've just bought.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.640
Come on, we live on an island.

01:03.680 --> 01:07.120
And I realised I should be out there

01:03.680 --> 01:07.120
on the water, sailing.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.320
So you bought a boat.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.240
Yes, well, you've got to have a boat if you

01:09.360 --> 01:12.240
want to go sailing, J.P.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.640
Yes, Chief. But you bought that boat.

01:14.680 --> 01:18.480
Yes, I know she's a bit tired around the edges,

01:14.680 --> 01:18.480
needs a lick of paint,

01:18.520 --> 01:20.640
but I can get her into shape and then, imagine!

01:21.440 --> 01:23.560
Come on, admit it.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.160
Don't you just want to be, you know,

01:26.920 --> 01:28.280
out there,

01:30.320 --> 01:31.440
sailing?

01:47.120 --> 01:48.640
Right, then, we're here!

01:50.800 --> 01:52.720
Guys?

01:52.760 --> 01:56.520
I just wanted to remind you, I want your best work,

01:52.760 --> 01:56.520
everyone.

01:56.560 --> 02:00.000
Clean samples. No contamination, okay?

02:00.040 --> 02:02.120
Nicky, if you'd like to take it from here?

02:02.160 --> 02:06.160
Sure. Er, okay, guys, we're doing three dives today,

02:02.160 --> 02:06.160
each 20 minutes long,

02:06.200 --> 02:09.040
so we need to keep an eye on

02:06.200 --> 02:09.040
our bottom time, yeah?

02:09.080 --> 02:12.480
Dan will be staying on board, so that's me, Sam, Laura

02:09.080 --> 02:12.480
and Jonathan

02:15.160 --> 02:18.320
-Not now, Jonathan. -Please, I've got to know.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.880
And I've told you, I haven't made up

02:19.880 --> 02:22.880
my mind, okay?

02:22.920 --> 02:24.360
I'll let you know when I have.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.760
SAM: Here, let me help you with that.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.120
Takes ages before this sort of stuff

02:31.800 --> 02:35.120
becomes second nature.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.240
-Thank you, Sam. -All right.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.560
Where's your sample bag?

02:40.320 --> 02:43.840
-Oh, I, erm... -I think you left it

02:40.320 --> 02:43.840
in the cabin.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.080
Yeah, let... Sorry, let me just go and grab it.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.600
Cut her some slack, will you?

02:55.320 --> 02:56.760
Have you seen my sample bag?

02:57.600 --> 02:58.760
Oh, I don't know.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.680
Found it!

03:09.560 --> 03:10.880
You know I love you, huh?

03:11.520 --> 03:12.680
And I love you, too.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.320
NICKY: Come on, Laura!

03:20.440 --> 03:21.600
Right, then.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.880
Let's go diving.

03:49.320 --> 03:54.560
I'll never get used to how beautiful the reef is.

03:49.320 --> 03:54.560
Those colours!

03:54.600 --> 03:56.440
Dan? We're back.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.120
-I'll get him. -LAURA: Okay.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.440
Thing is, Laura, the reef's not actually

03:58.160 --> 04:00.440
different colours, 'cause coral's only

04:00.480 --> 04:02.760
the one colour, white.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.160
It's Dan!

04:53.680 --> 04:56.080
Witnesses over here. The victim is on the boat.

04:56.120 --> 04:59.560
His name is Dan Hagen, a marine biologist.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.200
The witnesses are saying they were all scuba diving

05:01.240 --> 05:02.920
at the coral reef when he was shot.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.000
They reckon it was crooks on a passing boat.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.880
Robbery at sea? Well, let's check out

05:05.040 --> 05:06.880
the crime scene,

05:06.920 --> 05:08.560
see if that theory stacks up.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.000
Er, and I'll stand over there with the witnesses, you know,

05:11.040 --> 05:12.360
make sure they're all okay.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.560
Er, yes. Okay, J.P., good idea, you do that.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.440
That's us three working the crime scene, then.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.000
Looks like a small-calibre firearm.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.000
So, was he shot and then the place was ransacked,

05:36.040 --> 05:39.000
or was the place trashed first and then he was killed?

05:39.040 --> 05:42.680
It's hard to tell, sir, but someone

05:39.040 --> 05:42.680
was looking for something.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.720
And what do you think that was, Florence?

05:44.760 --> 05:47.560
Well, if it was a robbery, Chief, it would be for cash,

05:44.760 --> 05:47.560
portable goods.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.920
You know, the usual thing.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.960
I can't find the victim's wallet.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.400
HUMPHREY: Look at his wrist. There are tan marks

05:52.000 --> 05:55.400
but no watch,

05:55.440 --> 05:57.640
and I can't see a wallet or watch nearby.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.600
A toy soldier.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.400
HUMPHREY: Hmm, bizarre. What's a toy soldier doing

06:11.440 --> 06:13.880
on a science boat?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.760
Thanks, J.P. Could you help Dwayne finish processing

06:19.000 --> 06:22.760
the crime scene, please?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.800
Of course, sir. Er, I'm on it.

06:25.840 --> 06:29.920
Thank you all for waiting. Er, we have a few questions,

06:29.960 --> 06:32.680
er, starting with exactly who you all are.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.720
Of course. I'm Dr Sam Blake,

06:34.760 --> 06:37.600
head of the oceanography department

06:34.760 --> 06:37.600
at Princeton University.

06:37.640 --> 06:41.080
Er, this is Dr Nicky Hoskins of West Lothian University,

06:41.120 --> 06:43.720
a marine biologist and our lead diver.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.920
Jonathan Taylor, research graduate.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.120
And this is Laura, Dan's wife.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.520
Can I ask what you were all doing out at sea?

06:51.560 --> 06:53.160
We've been studying the coral reef,

06:53.200 --> 06:55.040
collecting groups of polyps that have lost their colour,

06:55.080 --> 06:57.200
it's a phenomenon known as coral bleaching.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.720
And you've all been doing this for how long?

06:59.760 --> 07:01.800
This trip? Four days.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.320
Dan and Laura already live here and we stay at

07:01.840 --> 07:05.320
his villa when we're working.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.600
In the first morning, we did a general survey and trash

07:05.360 --> 07:08.600
collection on the reef

07:08.640 --> 07:10.080
and then in the afternoon

07:10.120 --> 07:12.160
we finished up collecting the rest of the samples.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.440
But what you should know is that we were all underwater

07:12.200 --> 07:15.440
on the reef

07:15.480 --> 07:18.320
when, you know... When it happened.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.800
Mr Hagen stayed on the boat on his own?

07:20.840 --> 07:23.160
You always leave someone on the boat for safety.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.240
It was his turn, so...

07:25.280 --> 07:26.720
HUMPHREY: Yes, I'm sorry about this,

07:26.760 --> 07:28.760
but I'm having difficulty picturing the scene.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.760
If you could all explain exactly where you were

07:30.800 --> 07:32.520
when you last saw Mr Hagen?

07:32.560 --> 07:35.080
Sure. I was at the back of the boat

07:32.560 --> 07:35.080
putting on my diving gear

07:35.120 --> 07:38.320
when Dan went into the cabin.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.600
LAURA:<i> I went into the cabin</i> <i>to get a sample bag.</i>

07:40.640 --> 07:41.800
Found it!

07:41.840 --> 07:43.800
That was when I last saw him.

07:43.840 --> 07:48.080
And that's the last place I saw him as well,

07:43.840 --> 07:48.080
in the cabin, kissing Laura.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.360
<i>He was alive when we left.</i>

07:51.400 --> 07:52.560
Right, then.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.040
Let's go diving!

07:55.080 --> 07:57.880
And Jonathan

07:57.920 --> 08:00.080
Er, I don't really remember.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.400
I was just getting ready for the dive,

08:00.120 --> 08:03.400
that's what I was focusing on.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.320
I see. So Mr Hagen was killed and the boat was searched

08:06.360 --> 08:09.520
sometime in between you all leaving it

08:06.360 --> 08:09.520
and you all returning.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.840
What time was this?

08:10.880 --> 08:13.240
We started our dive at 10:00 this morning.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.320
<i>It took us a few minutes</i> <i>to swim down to the reef.</i>

08:15.360 --> 08:17.760
<i>We collected samples</i> <i>for 20 minutes</i>

08:17.800 --> 08:20.040
<i>and then we all swam back up</i> <i>to the boat.</i>

08:20.080 --> 08:24.480
So the window of opportunity is somewhere between

08:20.080 --> 08:24.480
10:00 a.m. and 10:30?

08:24.520 --> 08:26.440
I think so.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.760
Then were you in sight of each other the whole time

08:26.480 --> 08:29.760
you were underwater?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.960
Well, not exactly. I mean, we do try

08:29.800 --> 08:31.960
and stay together,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.640
but obviously we're focusing on collecting samples.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.320
So, one of you could have swum back to the boat.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.280
No, it's crystal clear down there.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.280
If anyone had swum away, someone would have

08:38.320 --> 08:41.280
noticed them go.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.360
You're sure about that?

08:42.400 --> 08:43.520
-Yeah. -Yeah.

08:43.560 --> 08:45.320
Pretty sure.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.360
Which is why you think Mr Hagen was killed

08:45.360 --> 08:48.360
by passing robbers?

08:48.400 --> 08:50.320
We noticed that his watch was missing.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.920
Does Mr Hagen normally carry a wallet on him?

08:52.960 --> 08:55.520
Always, with usually quite a few thousand dollars in it.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.600
Then, finally, can I ask,

08:57.640 --> 09:00.120
does anyone know why I found a little toy soldier

09:00.160 --> 09:02.120
near Mr Hagen's body?

09:02.680 --> 09:04.320
I'm sorry?

09:04.360 --> 09:08.200
I found a little metal toy soldier

09:04.360 --> 09:08.200
by the victim's body.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.600
Does anyone know why that might

09:08.240 --> 09:10.600
have been there?

09:10.640 --> 09:12.920
There weren't any children, perhaps, on the boat?

09:12.960 --> 09:14.320
-No. -SAM: No.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.320
And we clean the boat out every morning.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.760
So, if you found a toy in the cabin, it wasn't there

09:16.360 --> 09:19.760
when we set out.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.120
Oh, don't worry.  I'm sure it's not important.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.560
-Yes.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.160
Why don't you go and check and see

09:31.600 --> 09:33.160
if all the divers

09:33.200 --> 09:35.760
used the same amount of oxygen from their tanks.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.640
Er, good idea. Good idea.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.760
Hey! Why are you doing it over there?

09:52.800 --> 09:57.240
No reason. Just thought I'd do it here,

09:52.800 --> 09:57.240
you know?

09:57.280 --> 09:58.560
The light's better.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.120
Oh.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.040
That's good to know. Thank you.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.960
Tell you what I don't get, Florence.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.280
The victim was a millionaire,

10:14.320 --> 10:15.840
he'd have handed over his wallet and watch

10:15.880 --> 10:18.520
the moment the robbers asked for them, wouldn't he?

10:18.560 --> 10:20.960
So why did they have to shoot him dead?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.960
And you should know, sir, that was the Coast Guard

10:24.000 --> 10:25.560
and as far as they're aware,

10:25.600 --> 10:27.360
there weren't any other boats in the area this morning.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.680
And our witnesses are not getting on as well

10:29.920 --> 10:33.680
as they'd like us to think.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.160
Nicky Hoskins clearly has problems

10:33.720 --> 10:37.160
with the deceased's wife.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.840
If this wasn't a gang of criminals committing

10:42.640 --> 10:45.840
robbery at sea,

10:45.880 --> 10:47.440
have you found a gun anywhere on the boat?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.200
DWAYNE: No, sir.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.280
If you are the killer, sir, you'd just throw

10:49.240 --> 10:51.280
the gun overboard

10:51.320 --> 10:54.000
once the victim's dead, along with the wallet

10:51.320 --> 10:54.000
and watch.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.280
To make it look like robbery gone wrong.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.280
Yes, very good.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.640
Any chance of recovering them?

10:58.680 --> 11:00.160
FLORENCE: I'm sure we'll be able to find out

11:00.200 --> 11:02.080
the boat's coordinates at the time of the murder.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.760
I'm going to speak to the Saint-Marie Diving School,

11:03.800 --> 11:05.880
see if we can search the seabed nearby.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.960
Yes, please do. So we're going to need all the help

11:05.920 --> 11:08.960
we can get on this case,

11:09.000 --> 11:10.720
because I think you're right, Florence.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.800
One of those four people is our killer.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.080
But he was alive when they went

11:12.840 --> 11:15.080
into the water,

11:15.120 --> 11:16.960
and they're all saying they were all

11:15.120 --> 11:16.960
in sight of each other

11:17.000 --> 11:18.920
the whole time they were underwater.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.760
How did one of them swim back to the boat,

11:18.960 --> 11:22.760
shoot Dan Hagen dead,

11:22.800 --> 11:24.640
before then taking the time to trash the cabin

11:24.680 --> 11:26.320
to make it look like a robbery gone wrong,

11:26.360 --> 11:27.880
swim back to the reef

11:27.920 --> 11:29.560
and all without any of the other witnesses

11:29.600 --> 11:32.040
noticing the killer's absence at any time?

11:32.720 --> 11:34.120
Seemingly impossible.

11:34.840 --> 11:35.960
SAM: Excuse me?

11:39.360 --> 11:40.840
Yes?

11:40.880 --> 11:42.400
I just wanted to know when we could get our samples.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.600
I'm sorry, Dr Blake, but the boat's a crime scene.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.320
You won't be able to access your samples.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.960
Ah, but can we ask you a question?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.400
-Of course. -Could you tell us a bit about

11:51.440 --> 11:54.400
Nicky Hoskins' relationship with Mrs Hagen?

11:54.440 --> 11:56.600
Nicky used to be Dan's girlfriend.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.520
-Well, hold on a minute.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.280
Nicky, Dan and I have been working together on and off

12:00.320 --> 12:02.320
for about a decade and a half now.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.160
I didn't think she was the sort of person

12:06.200 --> 12:08.400
who was interested in relationships,

12:08.440 --> 12:10.560
but few years back, she and Dan got together.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.840
How was Nicky when it ended?

12:11.880 --> 12:13.640
Not great. We were out here at the time.

12:13.680 --> 12:17.440
She left the expedition and flew back

12:13.680 --> 12:17.440
to the UK soon after.

12:18.840 --> 12:22.840
I just think it's Laura that Nicky has a problem with.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.480
Ex-girlfriends, new wives,

12:24.520 --> 12:27.360
I mean, they're never going to be best friends, are they?

12:35.000 --> 12:40.120
So, I've been looking into Dan Hagen's life, sir,

12:35.000 --> 12:40.120
and he was very rich.

12:40.160 --> 12:44.000
He inherited a fortune when his parents died

12:40.160 --> 12:44.000
in his early 20s,

12:44.040 --> 12:47.960
and since then, he's dedicated his life

12:44.040 --> 12:47.960
to researching the oceans.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.680
HUMPHREY: A fortune that I presume

12:48.000 --> 12:50.680
his wife Laura inherits,

12:50.720 --> 12:52.680
which is interesting, because...

12:52.720 --> 12:56.920
Now, hold on a moment, erm... No, not you.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.480
Not you. No, not you. Ah, yes, right, here we go.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.640
So, Laura married Dan just under a year ago,

13:00.520 --> 13:03.640
but before,

13:03.680 --> 13:06.840
she worked as a flight attendant

13:03.680 --> 13:06.840
but she had a rich upbringing.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.800
Private school, parents both worked

13:06.880 --> 13:09.800
in the city.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.320
But there was a flag against her father's name

13:09.840 --> 13:12.320
on the system.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.640
-Yes, I've put in

13:12.360 --> 13:14.640
a request for them

13:14.680 --> 13:16.240
to release the file to us.

13:16.280 --> 13:19.160
-Ah, Commissioner,

13:16.280 --> 13:19.160
good afternoon!

13:19.200 --> 13:21.720
Good afternoon, Detective Inspector.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.440
-Good afternoon, Detective Sergeant.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.440
-Sir.

13:24.480 --> 13:28.600
So, word reaches me that a wealthy tourist

13:24.480 --> 13:28.600
has just been killed

13:28.640 --> 13:30.600
-while out on his boat. -Yes, that's right, sir.

13:30.640 --> 13:34.840
Only you should know, I've got a dinner at

13:30.640 --> 13:34.840
the yacht club tomorrow night

13:34.880 --> 13:37.480
and I want to be able to reassure the members

13:34.880 --> 13:37.480
of the committee

13:37.520 --> 13:40.280
that there isn't in fact a gang of pirates

13:40.320 --> 13:42.360
operating off the coast of Saint-Marie.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.920
Well, sir, I wouldn't want to rule

13:42.400 --> 13:45.920
anything out at this moment.

13:45.960 --> 13:49.560
Erm, but equally, I wouldn't want to rule

13:45.960 --> 13:49.560
anything in, either. I suppose what I'm saying

13:49.600 --> 13:53.200
is that it's, er, it's very early days.

13:53.240 --> 13:56.760
Then I'd appreciate it if you kept me

13:53.240 --> 13:56.760
abreast of the situation.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.200
Yes, of course, sir.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.560
So there's a yacht club on the island, is there?

14:02.600 --> 14:03.920
Oh, yes.

14:03.960 --> 14:07.640
Only, I've, erm... I've bought a yacht myself.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.920
You have?

14:12.960 --> 14:14.760
-Well, she needs

14:14.800 --> 14:17.520
a little bit of a spit and polish but, er,

14:14.800 --> 14:17.520
once she's shipshape,

14:17.560 --> 14:19.640
maybe I could join?

14:19.680 --> 14:22.000
Well, is that the time?

14:22.040 --> 14:24.760
Thank you very much, Detective Inspector, but, erm,

14:24.800 --> 14:27.280
I'm sure you're extremely busy.

14:27.320 --> 14:30.000
Good day. Good day.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.880
Yes, always glad to be of assistance, sir.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.840
What do you think he actually does all day?

14:38.880 --> 14:40.480
-Sir. -No, yes, of course, yes.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.640
Erm, carry on with background checks,

14:40.520 --> 14:42.640
would you?

14:42.680 --> 14:44.320
And see if you can put some pressure

14:42.680 --> 14:44.320
on the Met

14:44.360 --> 14:47.080
to release Laura's dad's file ASAP.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.640
I'm going to see what we can discover

14:48.680 --> 14:51.240
from the toy soldier we found at the scene.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.120
Okay, you've got to tell me what's going on.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.920
Excuse me?

15:13.960 --> 15:16.400
You've been acting strange ever since you

15:13.960 --> 15:16.400
came aboard that boat.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.160
I don't think I have, Dwayne. I'm... I'm cool.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.720
That was you being cool?

15:21.760 --> 15:26.280
Listen, I'm your partner, you've got to tell me

15:21.760 --> 15:26.280
if something's up.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.920
Okay.

15:30.960 --> 15:36.240
It's just... I can't swim, so I kind of don't like

15:30.960 --> 15:36.240
hanging around boats.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.440
You know, I don't like hanging around boats.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.760
No, no! Not that bit, the bit before that,

15:42.800 --> 15:44.600
the bit where you said you can't swim.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.640
-Well, that's because I can't. -But everybody can swim!

15:47.680 --> 15:49.840
I know. It's just, I can't.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.200
Is that bad?

15:53.240 --> 15:55.800
A police officer on an island in the middle

15:53.240 --> 15:55.800
of the Caribbean?

15:55.840 --> 15:58.160
It's not good, I can tell you that much.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.680
There are no fingerprints on this toy anywhere.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.480
-Not even a partial,

16:11.520 --> 16:14.760
or a partial of a partial. It's been wiped

16:11.520 --> 16:14.760
entirely clean.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.160
Why would you wipe a toy clean of fingerprints?

16:18.200 --> 16:21.240
Anyway, how are you getting on?

16:21.280 --> 16:26.040
Well, sir, Sam Blake only took up his post

16:21.280 --> 16:26.040
of Head of Oceanography

16:26.080 --> 16:28.640
at Princeton University earlier this year.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.000
-And as far as I can tell,

16:31.040 --> 16:34.000
he got the job partly because of

16:31.040 --> 16:34.000
a famous scientific paper

16:34.040 --> 16:37.240
-he and Mr Hagen published last year.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.240
-I see.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.120
"Mr Hagen and Dr Blake have revolutionised

16:37.280 --> 16:40.120
our understanding

16:40.160 --> 16:43.480
"of the coral reefs in the Caribbean."

16:40.160 --> 16:43.480
That's impressive.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.120
As for Jonathan Taylor, he graduated

16:43.520 --> 16:47.120
from Plymouth University

16:47.160 --> 16:49.520
with a first-class degree in Marine Biology.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.640
So, what about Nicky Hoskins, the, er,

16:49.560 --> 16:52.640
victim's ex

16:52.680 --> 16:56.040
She's got no prior convictions,

16:52.680 --> 16:56.040
but I spoke to Immigration

16:56.080 --> 16:57.480
and Sam Blake was right.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.960
He and Nicky were on Saint-Marie

16:57.520 --> 16:59.960
two years ago,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.120
but Nicky returned to the UK after only three days.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.560
-One moment, sir.

17:04.600 --> 17:05.880
Yes.

17:05.920 --> 17:09.800
It's all a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?

17:09.840 --> 17:14.160
Her being here at the precise moment

17:09.840 --> 17:14.160
her ex-boyfriend is killed,

17:14.200 --> 17:15.440
wouldn't you say?

17:15.480 --> 17:16.920
Okay, sir, this is an email

17:16.960 --> 17:18.880
-from the Metropolitan Police. -Yes.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.600
They have released Laura's dad's file,

17:20.640 --> 17:24.400
and it says here he was convicted

17:20.640 --> 17:24.400
of fraud 15 years ago.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.200
Was he?

17:26.240 --> 17:28.800
He was declared bankrupt and went to prison.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.520
HUMPHREY: So Laura's father

17:28.840 --> 17:30.520
is a criminal?

17:30.560 --> 17:32.160
FLORENCE: Who was once very rich.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.160
Laura would have lost everything when

17:32.200 --> 17:35.160
her dad went to prison.

17:35.200 --> 17:39.800
Yes, but with her husband dead,

17:35.200 --> 17:39.800
she's now very rich again.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.560
This is where Dan worked and kept all his

17:44.600 --> 17:47.560
research papers.

17:50.160 --> 17:54.000
The police wanted to see Dan's study,

17:50.160 --> 17:54.000
if that's okay with you?

17:54.840 --> 17:56.560
Of course.

18:06.280 --> 18:10.280
Is it really bad I can't swim?

18:10.320 --> 18:14.360
Okay, I'm going to tell you something you won't believe.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.920
When I started out as a young copper,

18:14.400 --> 18:17.920
I was a bit slack.

18:17.960 --> 18:21.320
Unreliable, even.  I know!

18:21.360 --> 18:23.680
But I remember my chief pulling me over

18:21.360 --> 18:23.680
to one side and saying,

18:23.720 --> 18:28.960
"Dwayne, a policeman can't have any weaknesses.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.520
"He needs to be the complete package."

18:31.560 --> 18:35.320
Yes, but, you know, on the subject of swimming.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.280
And that means we need to be able to give chase

18:35.360 --> 18:38.280
at a moment's notice,

18:38.320 --> 18:42.120
which is why I keep myself in a state of peak

18:38.320 --> 18:42.120
physical fitness.

18:42.160 --> 18:47.120
We need to be able to swim, J.P.

18:42.160 --> 18:47.120
The full package.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.200
You only have to look at me to see that.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.120
No weaknesses.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.120
I understand your father was convicted of fraud?

19:02.760 --> 19:05.920
-Your father went to prison.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.760
He broke the law, yes.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.560
That must have been tough.

19:11.600 --> 19:15.280
It was. I went off the rails, if I'm honest.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.760
Dropped out of school, left home as soon as I could.

19:19.800 --> 19:23.000
-I moved in with a friend

19:19.800 --> 19:23.000
from London.

19:24.360 --> 19:28.000
She was a flight attendant. That's how I became one.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.480
How did you meet Mr Hagen?

19:29.520 --> 19:32.160
It was on a flight from here to Heathrow.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.840
I was working the first-class cabin.

19:34.880 --> 19:39.520
Dan was reading an article in<i> The New York Times</i>

19:34.880 --> 19:39.520
on coral reefs.

19:39.560 --> 19:43.200
That's how we got talking. I had an interest in ecology

19:39.560 --> 19:43.200
from travelling.

19:43.240 --> 19:46.520
-About the things

19:43.240 --> 19:46.520
that mattered.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.000
Then again, it was easy.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.000
We had the same interests, the same sense of humour.

19:51.040 --> 19:54.880
I'm really sorry to ask, but do you inherit

19:51.040 --> 19:54.880
your husband's fortune?

19:54.920 --> 19:58.400
We were only married nine months ago.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.920
What are you suggesting?

19:59.960 --> 20:03.200
He was the most wonderful man I ever met.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.600
Yes.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.880
We understand that Nicky Hoskins was once

20:05.640 --> 20:08.880
your husband's girlfriend.

20:08.920 --> 20:12.560
Only, it just strikes us as odd that she'd be

20:08.920 --> 20:12.560
on this trip with you.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.480
LAURA:<i> Dan had said</i> <i>they always worked together</i>

20:14.520 --> 20:18.280
<i>and that Nicky was the best</i> <i>research diver he knew.</i>

20:18.320 --> 20:20.800
Anyway, I was the one that was married to him.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.320
<i>I didn't have anything</i> <i>to worry about.</i>

20:26.240 --> 20:28.960
And Miss Hoskins said yes to the invitation?

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Apparently there weren't many research jobs around.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.520
And she stayed in the house with you all?

20:34.560 --> 20:36.520
Your husband's ex

20:36.560 --> 20:41.000
Dan said we worked long hours and that we all

20:36.560 --> 20:41.000
needed to stay together.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.720
But you're right.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.040
It wasn't easy.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.520
<i>Nicky didn't have</i> <i>a problem with Dan.</i>

20:50.560 --> 20:53.080
<i>She had got over him.</i>

20:53.120 --> 20:55.800
<i>It was me</i> <i>she had a problem with.</i>

20:55.840 --> 20:58.480
Yeah, I'm sorry. There really

20:55.840 --> 20:58.480
wasn't any tension

20:58.520 --> 21:01.400
between Miss Hoskins and your husband?

21:02.440 --> 21:04.320
-There wasn't.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.560
But if you're asking if anyone argued with him before,

21:09.400 --> 21:12.600
there was somebody. But it wasn't Nicky.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.640
<i>It was yesterday.</i>

21:14.680 --> 21:18.720
<i>We'd been collecting samples</i> <i>all day and I was passing</i>

21:14.680 --> 21:18.720
<i>by Dan's study</i>

21:18.760 --> 21:21.000
<i>when I heard him</i> <i>arguing with Sam.</i>

21:21.880 --> 21:23.680
Do you know what it was about?

21:23.720 --> 21:26.880
It was something to do with the data that they'd

21:23.720 --> 21:26.880
been collecting.

21:26.920 --> 21:32.320
It was all in one folder and Sam didn't want it

21:26.920 --> 21:32.320
to be published.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.600
And would you, by any chance, know where this folder

21:32.360 --> 21:35.600
of data might be?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.480
DWAYNE: Mmm-hmm. Okay.

21:40.520 --> 21:43.600
So, that was Frankie from the Saint-Marie Dive School.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.560
He said he's had everyone searching the seabed

21:43.640 --> 21:46.560
where Dan was shot.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.240
But no sign of a wallet, a gold watch or a gun.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.720
-Well, it's a big sea

21:49.280 --> 21:51.720
out there, Chief!

21:51.760 --> 21:53.880
And you should know, sir, in saltwater,

21:53.920 --> 21:56.000
fingerprints start dissolving fast.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.760
So it's possible the evidence wouldn't

21:56.040 --> 21:58.760
tell us anything, anyway.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.080
Yes, yes. Well, thank you for trying. Er, how about you,

21:58.800 --> 22:02.080
Florence?

22:02.120 --> 22:03.520
How are you getting on with the folder

22:03.560 --> 22:05.720
that Dr Blake and Mr Hagen were arguing over?

22:05.760 --> 22:08.520
It's a lot of data, sir. It's hard to know

22:05.760 --> 22:08.520
what it means.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.680
Yes, well, maybe there's an independent expert

22:10.720 --> 22:12.400
you can rustle up to help you go through it.

22:15.520 --> 22:18.120
Well, sir, I'm going through Mr Hagen's laptop.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.920
And it's pretty clear he loved his wife.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.080
There are a lot of emails to her

22:23.120 --> 22:24.880
of a personal nature, if you see what I mean.

22:24.920 --> 22:27.640
-But no leads yet. -Okay. Keep digging.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.160
But in the morning, let's finish up for now.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.040
But I want everyone to keep thinking.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.760
One of those four people is our killer.

22:33.800 --> 22:37.200
So how come everyone said they were down here

22:37.240 --> 22:38.960
collecting samples the whole time,

22:39.000 --> 22:45.120
when in reality one of them was up here committing murder?

22:45.160 --> 22:48.680
How does our little metal friend

22:45.160 --> 22:48.680
fit into all of this?

22:53.680 --> 22:55.800
DWAYNE: Ahoy!

22:55.840 --> 22:58.560
Now, this is what I call sailing!

22:58.600 --> 23:00.600
A boat tied to the jetty

23:00.640 --> 23:03.680
that has its own bar at the other end.

23:03.720 --> 23:06.040
Ah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.800
-There's just so much to do

23:07.840 --> 23:10.120
to get the boat shipshape, Dwayne.

23:10.160 --> 23:14.520
So, how about we sand the combing first, you and me,

23:14.560 --> 23:16.840
then we can have a drink?

23:16.880 --> 23:19.920
I'll tell you what. Why don't you do 10

23:16.880 --> 23:19.920
to 15 minutes of sanding

23:19.960 --> 23:22.280
while I sit here and have a quick drink

23:22.320 --> 23:26.120
and then we'll swap

23:29.760 --> 23:31.920
All right, your time starts now!

23:31.960 --> 23:34.400
Jolly good. Right, here we go.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.400
-Better than sanding. -Better than sanding.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.120
And who knew the sun was going to go down

23:46.160 --> 23:48.600
before you even got a chance to give it a go?

23:48.640 --> 23:51.680
-Yes.

23:51.720 --> 23:55.760
She's going to be absolutely amazing

23:51.720 --> 23:55.760
when she's ready.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.120
So much that<i> Nancy</i> and I are going to do together.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.360
<i>Nancy?</i>

23:59.400 --> 24:00.880
Yes, apparently the boat's called<i> Nancy.</i>

24:00.920 --> 24:02.800
The funny thing is, when I was growing up,

24:02.840 --> 24:05.080
I used to live next door to a girl called Nancy.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.680
She'd babysit for us.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.360
That's why you bought a boat called<i> Nancy?</i>

24:08.400 --> 24:10.200
No! No, no, of course not.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.400
No, it's just complete coincidence

24:12.440 --> 24:16.760
that I bought a boat called, er,<i> Nancy.</i> Why are

24:12.440 --> 24:16.760
you looking at me like that?

24:16.800 --> 24:18.240
Like what?

24:18.280 --> 24:19.960
Like you're deciding whether to say something

24:18.280 --> 24:19.960
or not.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.600
No way!

24:24.960 --> 24:27.800
So, how's your love life?

24:27.840 --> 24:31.400
That went down the wrong hole. Yeah.

24:31.440 --> 24:34.560
Right. Erm, er, fine, thanks, Dwayne.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.160
-No reason.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.880
I was just shooting the breeze.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.160
Yeah.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.760
Right, come on, Harry. What is that?

24:54.800 --> 24:57.760
Right over left or left...

25:01.040 --> 25:02.200
Ah.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.760
Not again! Ah!

25:06.800 --> 25:08.000
HUMPHREY:  <i>Please leave a message</i>

25:06.800 --> 25:08.000
<i>after the beep.</i>

25:09.960 --> 25:12.680
FLORENCE:<i> Sir,</i> <i>if you're there, pick up!</i>

25:09.960 --> 25:12.680
<i>This is important.</i>

25:12.720 --> 25:14.440
<i>I found something!</i>

25:14.480 --> 25:16.960
Oh, get that for me, Harry. I'm a bit tied up

25:14.480 --> 25:16.960
at the moment.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.160
FLORENCE:<i> Sir, are you there?</i>

25:18.200 --> 25:21.920
No

25:23.880 --> 25:25.800
FLORENCE:<i> Okay, well,</i> <i>I'll meet you at the station.</i>

25:30.720 --> 25:34.640
Ah, good morning, Florence. Erm, where are

25:30.720 --> 25:34.640
Dwayne and J.P.?

25:34.680 --> 25:37.360
Following up a lead. We found a receipt

25:34.680 --> 25:37.360
for a lock-up

25:37.400 --> 25:40.160
in Dan Hagen's name, so they've gone

25:37.400 --> 25:40.160
to check it out.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.680
Ah, jolly good. So what did you

25:40.200 --> 25:42.680
want to tell me?

25:42.720 --> 25:45.800
Well, sir, you were right to make me get hold

25:42.720 --> 25:45.800
of an expert.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.840
Because when I talked through the data

25:47.880 --> 25:51.680
with a professor from the oceanography department

25:47.880 --> 25:51.680
in Marseille University,

25:51.720 --> 25:53.800
he was able to spot it at once.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.400
Spot... Spot what?

25:55.440 --> 25:58.000
Well, sir, last time Mr Hagen and Dr Blake

25:58.040 --> 26:00.560
were getting readings from the reef of temperature,

26:00.600 --> 26:03.520
salinity, carbon dioxide and so on,

26:06.080 --> 26:08.080
All other readings are back to normal.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.080
As my expert put it, either the data they used

26:11.120 --> 26:13.560
for the famous paper was contaminated,

26:13.600 --> 26:15.920
or much worse.

26:15.960 --> 26:17.480
It was faked.

26:17.520 --> 26:21.280
I think it's time we spoke to Dr Sam Blake. Don't you?

26:26.480 --> 26:27.960
What's up?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.040
You ever get the sixth sense someone's watching you?

26:30.920 --> 26:32.440
Come on, open it up!

26:32.480 --> 26:35.440
Let's see what Mr Hagen keeps in here.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.440
I understand you and Mr Hagen published a paper

26:48.480 --> 26:51.480
on the coral reefs of Saint-Marie last year.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.960
Well, that's very gratifying.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.280
Did you read about it at the time

26:54.000 --> 26:56.280
in the national press?

26:56.320 --> 26:57.760
No.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.800
Yeah, but it has come up as part of our enquiries.

26:59.840 --> 27:04.000
In the paper, you proved that in elevated sea temperatures,

27:04.040 --> 27:08.440
high levels of dissolved CO2 resulted

27:04.040 --> 27:08.440
in increased bleaching.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.320
Whereas the zooxanthellae in the polyps died.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.760
You have done your research.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.480
Yes, I have no idea what she's talking about.

27:14.520 --> 27:17.800
Well, most people can't even pronounce zooxanthellae,

27:17.840 --> 27:19.280
let alone know what it means.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.000
But on this trip,

27:21.040 --> 27:24.640
you're not getting the same data

27:21.040 --> 27:24.640
from the reef, are you?

27:24.680 --> 27:28.000
Well, it's early days.

27:24.680 --> 27:28.000
There's still time.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.600
Please, don't lie to us.

27:31.960 --> 27:33.680
I'm sorry?

27:33.720 --> 27:35.800
Before you try and deny it, Mrs Hagen overheard

27:33.720 --> 27:35.800
the argument

27:35.840 --> 27:39.120
you had with her husband in his lab the night

27:35.840 --> 27:39.120
before he was killed,

27:39.160 --> 27:42.600
when you tried to get him to suppress your new findings.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.960
Look, you don't understand.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.960
This has been my life's work.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.520
And when we were here the last time,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.520
we got amazing readings.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.160
It was our breakthrough, a chance to publish

27:56.200 --> 27:57.800
and to really make our names.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.520
<i>But this time it was obvious</i>

28:00.560 --> 28:02.760
<i>that our previous data</i> <i>had been contaminated.</i>

28:02.800 --> 28:04.840
<i>And we soon worked it out,</i> <i>the dissolved CO2 reader</i>

28:04.880 --> 28:07.760
<i>had been</i> <i>calibrated incorrectly,</i>

28:04.880 --> 28:07.760
<i>but the point was</i>

28:07.800 --> 28:11.400
<i>our famous paper</i> <i>was based on false readings.</i>

28:13.520 --> 28:15.920
What did Nicky say about this?

28:15.960 --> 28:17.800
We haven't told her about it.

28:17.840 --> 28:21.920
Isn't she supposed to be a core member of your team?

28:21.960 --> 28:24.160
Okay, so it was just you and Mr Hagen in on this,

28:24.200 --> 28:27.160
which brings us back to the evening

28:24.200 --> 28:27.160
before he was killed

28:27.200 --> 28:29.600
and your argument with him in his lab.

28:29.640 --> 28:32.440
SAM:<i> Dan wanted to retract</i> <i>the paper at once.</i>

28:32.480 --> 28:33.760
<i>This was my triumph, too.</i>

28:33.800 --> 28:35.440
<i>I begged him to wait</i>

28:35.480 --> 28:37.680
<i>until we collected more data.</i> <i>But he wouldn't listen to me.</i>

28:37.720 --> 28:39.680
Then again, why would he? He's a multi-millionaire.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.480
He doesn't care what people think about him.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.160
It's not the same for me.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.840
It took me a long time to get here.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.880
If I lose my reputation...

28:50.920 --> 28:54.360
You'd lose your new job in the United States.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.440
So you killed Dan Hagen to keep your reputation.

28:58.480 --> 29:02.400
No, no!

29:02.440 --> 29:04.000
No, you don't understand, I'm trying to explain

29:04.040 --> 29:06.760
why Dan and I argued the night before he died.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.760
Why it was important to me.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.400
But with Dan alive, he'd have discredited you.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.240
And with him dead,

29:15.280 --> 29:18.600
your reputation and job are once again safe,

29:15.280 --> 29:18.600
aren't they?

29:22.680 --> 29:24.760
It's just science stuff in here, isn't it?

29:24.800 --> 29:26.000
What?

29:29.160 --> 29:30.800
You still think we are being watched?

29:30.840 --> 29:32.400
Eh? No way.

29:32.440 --> 29:36.480
Because if there was someone out there,

29:32.440 --> 29:36.480
I would know.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.520
Remember, J.P., the complete package!

29:40.560 --> 29:43.360
Don't worry yourself, man. You'll be just fine!

29:48.040 --> 29:50.560
Let us out! We're the police!

29:50.600 --> 29:52.560
Let us out!

29:52.920 --> 29:54.200
Man!

29:59.440 --> 30:02.880
You okay? -Of course I'm okay!

30:02.920 --> 30:06.200
-You don't look okay. -Look, I'm okay.

30:06.240 --> 30:09.960
It's just... You know how I said policeman can't

30:06.240 --> 30:09.960
have any weaknesses?

30:12.400 --> 30:15.200
Well, I don't. Of course not.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.520
It's just... Okay.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.200
I used to be scared of the dark.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.440
You're scared of the dark?

30:23.680 --> 30:26.200
The dark and enclosed spaces.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.560
But I'm cured now, you know.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.240
I'm 100% cured!

30:35.520 --> 30:37.440
-I'm going to ring

30:35.520 --> 30:37.440
the Inspector.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.400
Let me see if I can get a signal.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.040
-He will be able to get us out of here.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.040
-Mmm-hmm.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.200
Now, that is very interesting!

30:48.240 --> 30:52.440
-Ah! No, no. Er, you go first.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.840
What have you been able to dig up?

30:53.880 --> 30:56.360
And then I shall tell you my breakthrough.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.640
Well, sir, I've been doing financial checks

30:58.680 --> 31:03.320
and the student, Jonathan Taylor, is the only

30:58.680 --> 31:03.320
witness with money problems.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.120
He's over his limit on two credit cards

31:06.160 --> 31:08.400
and he's got significant student loans.

31:08.440 --> 31:12.360
Although he doesn't benefit financially from Dan's death

31:08.440 --> 31:12.360
in any way, does he?

31:12.400 --> 31:13.640
No, sir.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.440
As for Laura Hagen, you know how she said

31:16.480 --> 31:18.760
she dropped out of school at 17?

31:18.800 --> 31:21.200
Turns out she didn't have much choice.

31:21.240 --> 31:26.120
She was expelled for having an affair

31:21.240 --> 31:26.120
with a teacher.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.400
Gosh!

31:28.440 --> 31:30.840
So she wasn't wrong when she said

31:28.440 --> 31:30.840
she went off the rails.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.920
And Nicky Hoskins' boss at the university

31:30.880 --> 31:33.920
has been in touch.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.200
But there's still nothing that helps us.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.640
She shares a flat with someone from

31:36.240 --> 31:39.640
the English faculty

31:39.680 --> 31:43.640
and her boss says Nicky is basically well-liked

31:39.680 --> 31:43.640
and well-respected.

31:43.680 --> 31:44.880
Good.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.760
So, that's me, sir. What have you got?

31:47.800 --> 31:50.120
Well, it is, like I said, a bit of a breakthrough.

31:52.080 --> 31:55.840
Because our soldier turns out to be

31:55.880 --> 31:59.120
a model of a Duke of Wellington

31:55.880 --> 31:59.120
infantryman

31:59.160 --> 32:00.760
from the 1815 Napoleonic Wars.

32:00.800 --> 32:04.160
Made by Hemsworth and Platt, a company based in Harrogate.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.720
-Sir. -Yes, I know, I know, I know.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.800
But come on.

32:08.840 --> 32:12.760
Why did we find a toy soldier with no fingerprints

32:08.840 --> 32:12.760
on a science boat?

32:16.600 --> 32:18.160
It's odd.

32:19.120 --> 32:22.200
Hello? Ah, yes, J.P.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.400
How you getting on down at the lock

32:25.520 --> 32:27.480
I'm sorry. What?

32:28.280 --> 32:30.040
You okay, Dwayne?

32:30.080 --> 32:32.200
We've been locked in here for a reason.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.600
I'm just trying to find out why.

32:36.160 --> 32:39.080
You know, it happened when I was three.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.200
Huh?

32:41.240 --> 32:44.480
My brother, he pushed me into a swimming pool.

32:44.520 --> 32:47.440
I've been scared of water ever since.

32:47.480 --> 32:50.480
I was five. My sister locked me

32:47.480 --> 32:50.480
inside an old trunk

32:50.520 --> 32:51.960
and wouldn't let me out.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.720
For three hours, you know.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.320
You have a sister?

32:56.360 --> 32:59.400
So it's lucky we don't have any weaknesses, eh, J.P.?

33:00.760 --> 33:03.560
-No weaknesses! -Good!

33:04.480 --> 33:05.680
Ah.

33:09.160 --> 33:12.320
-Yeah, don't worry.

33:09.160 --> 33:12.320
We're just fine.

33:12.360 --> 33:15.080
-Glad to hear it.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.400
Dwayne?

33:18.400 --> 33:19.600
Don't worry, sir.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.480
Dwayne is in no way scared or worried.

33:22.520 --> 33:23.920
He's a complete package.

33:23.960 --> 33:27.520
Hmm, and speaking of complete packages...

33:29.800 --> 33:31.760
-Cocaine. -Crikey.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.840
DWAYNE: I reckon about half a kilo, Chief.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.720
So what's a millionaire marine biologist

33:35.760 --> 33:39.080
doing with half a kilo of cocaine in his lock

33:35.760 --> 33:39.080
Hmm?

33:42.640 --> 33:45.000
You see, all along we've been presuming

33:42.640 --> 33:45.000
this was about money,

33:45.040 --> 33:47.280
rather than someone protecting their reputation

33:47.320 --> 33:49.600
or a jilted girlfriend getting revenge.

33:49.640 --> 33:52.040
But what if it's got nothing to do

33:49.640 --> 33:52.040
with any of that?

33:52.080 --> 33:54.760
-HUMPHREY: Exactly.

33:54.800 --> 33:55.920
-Yes.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.760
We've got another fingerprint.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.560
-No, sir.

33:59.600 --> 34:00.960
It's the first fingerprint on the drugs

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
that doesn't belong to Dan Hagen.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.560
Jonathan Taylor, the student.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.080
We should go and interview him.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.720
Wait. Er, J.P., ring the witnesses' villa,

34:08.760 --> 34:10.960
let's see if anyone's seen Jonathan this afternoon.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.160
That if Jonathan is the guy that locked

34:12.840 --> 34:15.160
Dwayne and J.P. in,

34:15.200 --> 34:17.240
he must have known they'd get out at some point,

34:17.280 --> 34:20.560
that they'd find the cocaine at some point

34:17.280 --> 34:20.560
with his fingerprints on.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.160
So what's he been up to in the meantime?

34:22.200 --> 34:24.560
But he can't get off the island.

34:22.200 --> 34:24.560
We've got his passport.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.720
There's more than one way off Saint-Marie, Florence.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.200
I'm speaking to Laura. -Yes.

34:29.240 --> 34:31.040
She says Jonathan just cleared out his room,

34:31.080 --> 34:33.680
packed and left. She doesn't know

34:31.080 --> 34:33.680
where he's gone to.

34:33.720 --> 34:35.600
You know what? I bet I do. Come on, let's go!

34:46.080 --> 34:47.520
MAN: Whoa. Whoa.

34:53.240 --> 34:55.200
Hey! Stop. Hey!

35:07.400 --> 35:09.200
HUMPHREY: Florence?

35:32.160 --> 35:34.280
Now, that's what I call "no weaknesses," Dwayne.

35:34.320 --> 35:36.160
Gosh! You can say that again.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.960
It's not what you think.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.920
HUMPHREY: Doesn't matter what we think,

35:42.000 --> 35:43.920
it's what a jury thinks

35:43.960 --> 35:46.680
when they discover your fingerprints all over

35:43.960 --> 35:46.680
half a kilo of cocaine.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.560
And that you locked up two serving police officers

35:48.600 --> 35:50.040
in a dark garage.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.240
-That as well. -And then tried to escape.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.840
Oh, yes. And that as well.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.600
It's been my dream, this job.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.560
Working out here with Dan in the Caribbean,

36:00.600 --> 36:02.400
it's all I've ever wanted to do.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.840
Tell us about the cocaine.

36:06.240 --> 36:09.200
There was this guy that I met at the Student Union,

36:10.200 --> 36:12.040
we got chatting.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.800
He knew all about my job.

36:13.840 --> 36:16.440
He said all I had to do was collect a package

36:13.840 --> 36:16.440
while I was out here

36:16.480 --> 36:19.560
and take it back to him in the UK,

36:16.480 --> 36:19.560
and that he would... He would pay me

36:19.600 --> 36:22.680
5,000 pounds to do it.

36:22.720 --> 36:23.960
You're a drugs mule.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.400
HUMPHREY: Mr Hagen found out, didn't he?

36:26.440 --> 36:27.920
JONATHAN:<i> Yeah,</i> <i>he caught me red-handed.</i>

36:31.520 --> 36:33.400
<i>Dan said he had to</i> <i>report me to the police</i>

36:33.440 --> 36:36.200
<i>and I begged him to wait,</i> <i>'cause I'd be finished</i>

36:33.440 --> 36:36.200
<i>if he did.</i>

36:36.240 --> 36:37.640
<i>And he said</i> <i>he'd think about it.</i>

36:37.680 --> 36:39.200
Please, I've got to know.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.840
And I've told you, I haven't made up

36:39.240 --> 36:41.840
my mind, okay?

36:41.880 --> 36:43.280
When I saw Dan had been killed,

36:43.320 --> 36:46.040
I knew I had to find the stuff before you did.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.280
So eventually I realised maybe they're

36:46.080 --> 36:48.280
in Dan's lock up.

36:48.320 --> 36:51.680
And when I got there, I saw your two

36:48.320 --> 36:51.680
police officers.

36:51.720 --> 36:54.200
<i>I knew I was right</i> <i>that that's where</i>

36:51.720 --> 36:54.200
<i>Dan had put the drugs,</i>

36:54.240 --> 36:57.880
<i>covered in my prints!</i> <i>And I just panicked.</i>

36:58.920 --> 37:00.160
Okay.

37:08.160 --> 37:11.080
Now, let me put an alternative theory to you.

37:11.120 --> 37:13.480
Dan Hagen decided to tell the police that

37:11.120 --> 37:13.480
you were a drugs mule,

37:13.520 --> 37:15.400
so you killed him.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.360
And you thought you'd got away with it

37:15.440 --> 37:17.360
until you saw my two officers

37:17.400 --> 37:19.600
about to find the cocaine that proves that you

37:17.400 --> 37:19.600
were a murderer.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.080
So you decided to make a run for it.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.120
No, no, I shouldn't have run. I know that now.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.520
But you have to believe me,

37:24.560 --> 37:27.720
I've never done anything like this before.

37:27.760 --> 37:31.400
I'll admit to the drugs but I couldn't kill anyone!

37:46.320 --> 37:50.680
Well, I think we all owe our amazing

37:46.320 --> 37:50.680
Detective Sergeant a drink

37:50.720 --> 37:53.760
after all those athletic heroics.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.560
-Well done, Sarge! -Thank you, Dwayne!

37:55.600 --> 37:58.880
Eh, J.P., you're coming for a celebratory drink,

37:55.600 --> 37:58.880
or two or three?

38:00.840 --> 38:02.880
Chief?

38:02.920 --> 38:05.720
Oh, er, I'd love to, but I've, erm, well, I've

38:02.920 --> 38:05.720
still got my boat.

38:05.760 --> 38:09.800
Er, so I'll be spending the evening sanding.

38:05.760 --> 38:09.800
I love it!

38:09.840 --> 38:12.560
-Okay, Chief. -Okay.

38:20.280 --> 38:23.320
-Oh. Officer. -Just came for some food.

38:23.360 --> 38:26.080
Hey, no worries. Have a good evening.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.000
CATHERINE: Would you like a table outside?

38:30.040 --> 38:33.240
-Sure have.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.920
DWAYNE: Then we better stay here.

38:34.960 --> 38:38.560
This is now a very important undercover police operation.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.440
Which means the drinks are on expenses.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.120
Hello!

39:05.080 --> 39:06.320
Oh...

39:09.440 --> 39:11.320
Inspector?

39:11.360 --> 39:13.120
-Oh, God.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.160
Commissioner!

39:19.680 --> 39:21.840
Can I, er, get you some help?

39:21.880 --> 39:24.440
Er, no, no. Don't worry, sir.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.840
It's just merely a flesh wound.

39:26.880 --> 39:30.240
And this eye still works.  Yes.

39:31.400 --> 39:32.600
So...

39:34.360 --> 39:35.520
this...

39:36.600 --> 39:38.480
is your yacht?

39:38.520 --> 39:39.720
Yes, sir.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.560
You should know, sir,

39:42.600 --> 39:44.800
Mr Hagen wasn't murdered by criminals.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.000
I think it was one of his team.

39:47.040 --> 39:52.040
We just need to work out the how and the, er, who.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.800
And the, you know, why.

39:54.840 --> 39:58.520
Then I'll be sure to tell the president

39:54.840 --> 39:58.520
of the yacht club right now.

39:58.560 --> 40:01.240
-Oh, yes!

40:01.280 --> 40:04.720
I'm having dinner with him on his boat.

40:05.880 --> 40:08.240
Just there.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.480
HUMPHREY: Right.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.480
Have a good evening, Inspector.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.320
Yeah.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.600
Yeah.

40:27.240 --> 40:28.920
ALL: Commissioner!

40:39.760 --> 40:41.040
CATHERINE: Oh, Humphrey!

40:41.080 --> 40:42.320
Oh, good evening, Catherine.

40:42.360 --> 40:44.440
What on earth have you done to your leg?

40:44.480 --> 40:46.720
Er...

40:46.760 --> 40:49.240
-I'll get the first aid kit.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.920
HUMPHREY: Thanks.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.640
DWAYNE: We've been keeping them under

40:50.960 --> 40:52.640
surveillance, Chief.

40:52.680 --> 40:53.880
HUMPHREY: Yes, I see.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.360
LAURA: I was the one that was married!

40:58.560 --> 41:00.720
SAM: Laura.

41:00.760 --> 41:02.320
Just give her...

41:08.320 --> 41:10.400
Why did you do that, hmm?

41:12.200 --> 41:15.720
Well, that was interesting.

41:15.760 --> 41:17.840
HUMPHREY: Yes, it was. Wasn't it?

41:25.640 --> 41:28.040
Oh! Good morning, sir.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.080
You're in early.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.480
It's Nicky Hoskins, Florence.

41:32.520 --> 41:34.440
All along, she's been our most obvious suspect.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.960
I mean, what kind of person

41:36.000 --> 41:38.680
takes a job with their ex-boyfriend

41:36.000 --> 41:38.680
and his new wife?

41:38.720 --> 41:40.640
-Nicky needed the work. -True.

41:40.680 --> 41:42.560
But I remembered your notes said Nicky had a flatmate.

41:42.600 --> 41:45.440
So I got her number and I've just finished

41:42.600 --> 41:45.440
talking to her.

41:45.480 --> 41:49.000
-Yes, and I wrote it

41:45.480 --> 41:49.000
all down here.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.640
So,

41:50.680 --> 41:52.560
the flatmate said that Nicky, er, kept herself to herself.

41:52.600 --> 41:53.880
<i>Quelle surprise</i> there.

41:53.920 --> 41:56.280
And she hasn't had a boyfriend in two years.

41:56.320 --> 42:00.080
But when I pressed her, I hit gold, Florence, gold.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.440
Because a few months ago,

42:01.480 --> 42:03.560
the flatmate got back early from a night out

42:03.600 --> 42:06.600
and found Nicky on the phone in the sitting room.

42:06.640 --> 42:09.360
She'd been drinking, she was crying,

42:09.400 --> 42:14.040
and pleading to be with the person on the other

42:09.400 --> 42:14.040
end of the phone.

42:14.080 --> 42:18.080
Only her ex-boyfriend, Dan Hagen.

42:18.120 --> 42:19.600
No way!

42:19.640 --> 42:21.360
How do you know that?

42:21.400 --> 42:24.560
Because her flatmate very clearly heard her say

42:21.400 --> 42:24.560
"I miss you,"

42:24.600 --> 42:27.920
"I want you" and "I love you" a number of times.

42:27.960 --> 42:30.800
-No.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.720
I think it's time that Nicky told us the truth.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.800
Don't you?

42:47.920 --> 42:50.080
Hello.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.920
Er, the others said you were down here.

42:51.960 --> 42:55.520
I needed to clear my head.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.200
You see, all along, we've been struggling to understand

42:59.800 --> 43:01.520
what made you take this job.

43:01.560 --> 43:02.840
Dan asked me to.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.760
But you didn't have to accept.

43:05.760 --> 43:06.960
What is this?

43:07.000 --> 43:09.120
If you could just answer the question.

43:09.160 --> 43:11.320
We were all on the reef when Dan was shot.

43:11.360 --> 43:13.360
Why are you treating me like a suspect?

43:13.400 --> 43:15.160
Well, because you...

43:15.200 --> 43:17.440
You used to go out with him.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.400
Because we know you're still in love with him.

43:25.200 --> 43:26.440
You rang him a few months ago.

43:26.480 --> 43:29.440
Your flatmate Louise overheard the call.

43:29.480 --> 43:33.000
That was, erm, just one moment of madness.

43:33.040 --> 43:36.520
But that is why you decided to take this job again, right?

43:36.560 --> 43:39.320
Isn't it? Because you still loved him.

43:39.360 --> 43:41.280
So why have you been lying to us?

43:44.960 --> 43:48.000
The day that Dan told me it was over,

43:48.040 --> 43:51.160
I thought he was going to propose to me.

43:51.200 --> 43:53.920
Hmm. Imagine how that made me feel.

43:53.960 --> 43:57.160
And when he married the next woman

43:53.960 --> 43:57.160
that came along...

43:57.200 --> 43:59.520
Well, I tried to get over him.

43:59.560 --> 44:01.040
I tried so hard.

44:01.760 --> 44:03.000
But you couldn't.

44:03.760 --> 44:05.840
I thought I had.

44:05.880 --> 44:10.640
Until that one night of weakness.

44:10.680 --> 44:15.000
And a few weeks later, he contacted me

44:10.680 --> 44:15.000
and invited me out here.

44:15.040 --> 44:19.240
-Which I don't understand. -That's the type

44:15.040 --> 44:19.240
of man he was.

44:19.280 --> 44:22.680
<i>I think that he even</i> <i>thought that if I met his wife</i>

44:22.720 --> 44:24.480
<i>I would come to like her.</i>

44:24.520 --> 44:26.360
FLORENCE:<i> But you didn't?</i>

44:27.200 --> 44:28.400
NICKY:<i> Would you?</i>

44:29.960 --> 44:31.360
So you took this job

44:31.400 --> 44:32.880
so you could be in the company of Mr Hagen again.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.400
Isn't that right?

44:36.440 --> 44:39.080
But it was impossible to forgive him, wasn't it?

44:39.120 --> 44:40.920
Not for what he'd done.

44:40.960 --> 44:43.040
-So he had to die. -No, no.

44:45.120 --> 44:48.120
I would gladly kill that bitch.

44:48.160 --> 44:51.200
But I would never harm Dan.

44:51.240 --> 44:53.440
He was my soulmate.

44:53.480 --> 44:55.520
He just didn't know.

45:00.200 --> 45:05.000
So Nicky Hoskins kills Dan Hagen because

45:00.200 --> 45:05.000
if she can't have him,

45:05.040 --> 45:06.600
then no one can have him.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.240
Although killing him is the only way

45:06.640 --> 45:08.240
of guaranteeing

45:08.280 --> 45:11.600
-she'll never see him again. -I know what you mean.

45:11.640 --> 45:13.880
Not that any of that matters, Florence,

45:13.920 --> 45:16.320
because Nicky's right.

45:17.160 --> 45:19.840
She's got three witnesses

45:19.880 --> 45:21.960
who say she was underwater at the coral reef

45:22.000 --> 45:24.040
at the time Dan was killed.

45:24.080 --> 45:26.480
So how could she, or indeed anyone else,

45:26.520 --> 45:29.080
possibly have been in two places

45:26.520 --> 45:29.080
at the same time?

45:31.760 --> 45:33.480
Hold on.

45:33.520 --> 45:36.480
-Boats dump their rubbish

45:33.520 --> 45:36.480
in the sea.

45:36.520 --> 45:37.880
It then washes up later.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.840
Yes, but look at the edges, they're all smooth.

45:39.880 --> 45:43.120
Well, sir, everything gets worn down in the sea.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.360
Yes.

45:46.240 --> 45:49.200
In saltwater, fingerprints start dissolving fast.

45:51.320 --> 45:53.320
-Hold on!

45:55.760 --> 45:59.280
Now, you're out on your boat, say, having a great time.

45:59.320 --> 46:01.360
You drop a bottle overboard.

46:01.400 --> 46:03.880
-You're getting wet, sir! -Hold on!

46:08.600 --> 46:09.680
So that's that!

46:12.040 --> 46:14.920
You see, it's all very simple when you look at it properly,

46:12.040 --> 46:14.920
Florence.

46:15.680 --> 46:17.040
What does that mean?

46:17.080 --> 46:19.040
There are no fingerprints on this toy, anyway.

46:19.080 --> 46:21.640
So, was he shot and then the place

46:19.080 --> 46:21.640
was ransacked

46:21.680 --> 46:24.680
or was the place trashed first and then he was killed?

46:24.720 --> 46:28.760
In the first morning, we did a general survey and

46:24.720 --> 46:28.760
trash collection on the reef.

46:28.800 --> 46:32.080
But was that before the gun and the wallet and watch,

46:32.120 --> 46:34.360
or was it after?

46:34.400 --> 46:36.600
And was the boat trashed before,

46:34.400 --> 46:36.600
or was it after?

46:36.640 --> 46:39.440
If you are the killer, sir, you'd just throw

46:36.640 --> 46:39.440
the gun overboard

46:39.480 --> 46:40.840
once the victim's dead.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.000
You shoot him...

46:42.040 --> 46:44.120
No, that's not possible, is it?

46:44.160 --> 46:45.680
Unless...

46:45.720 --> 46:48.040
If X then Y, if X then Y...

46:48.080 --> 46:50.480
I thought he was going to propose to me.

46:50.520 --> 46:51.760
I always thought she was one of those people

46:51.800 --> 46:53.640
who wasn't interested in relationships.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.600
That's why you'd say that.

46:55.640 --> 46:58.600
And finally, that's how you get to and from

46:55.640 --> 46:58.600
the coral reef, of course!

46:58.640 --> 47:00.080
It's the riddle of the two barbers.

47:00.120 --> 47:02.280
-The riddle

47:00.120 --> 47:02.280
of the two barbers.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.560
Understand that, Florence,

47:03.600 --> 47:05.120
and you understand who killed Dan Hagen.

47:05.160 --> 47:07.560
-Yes, I do.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.760
And how the killer got to and from the reef

47:09.800 --> 47:11.280
without anyone noticing?

47:11.320 --> 47:13.720
That as well!

47:13.760 --> 47:15.800
Although to prove it, I'm going to need

47:13.760 --> 47:15.800
some flight details.

47:15.840 --> 47:18.000
-I think there's a phone call

47:20.200 --> 47:23.920
An academic institution, Florence. But you knew that,

47:20.200 --> 47:23.920
didn't you?

47:36.320 --> 47:38.360
Thank you all for joining us.

47:38.400 --> 47:39.840
What's going on here?

47:43.000 --> 47:45.040
There's a small town

47:45.080 --> 47:48.120
and in that town, there are only two barbers.

47:48.160 --> 47:49.680
Now, one of them is great at cutting hair,

47:49.720 --> 47:52.480
has a spotless salon and charges reasonable prices.

47:52.520 --> 47:56.560
The other barber is terrible at his job.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.960
And charges exorbitantly for his services.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.800
What is this?

48:00.840 --> 48:05.120
Now, there is a man in this town who needs

48:00.840 --> 48:05.120
a haircut.

48:05.160 --> 48:07.680
And even though he knows the reputation

48:05.160 --> 48:07.680
of the two barbers,

48:07.720 --> 48:11.040
he chooses to get his hair cut

48:07.720 --> 48:11.040
by the bad barber.

48:11.640 --> 48:12.800
Why?

48:12.840 --> 48:14.720
What's this got to do with anything?

48:14.760 --> 48:18.200
Don't worry. We don't know, either.

48:18.240 --> 48:21.040
Is that what you brought us together for,

48:18.240 --> 48:21.040
to ask us riddles?

48:21.080 --> 48:24.520
No, I brought you here to reveal who

48:21.080 --> 48:24.520
killed Dan Hagen.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.440
So was it you, Laura?

48:31.160 --> 48:32.640
No.

48:32.680 --> 48:35.240
-We'd only just got married. -HUMPHREY: That's right!

48:35.280 --> 48:37.600
It doesn't make sense that you'd kill

48:35.280 --> 48:37.600
the love of your life

48:37.640 --> 48:40.160
so soon after marrying him.

48:41.320 --> 48:43.240
So maybe it was Dr Sam Blake here.

48:43.280 --> 48:46.760
After all, how would his university react

48:43.280 --> 48:46.760
once they found out

48:46.800 --> 48:48.880
that the famous paper he and Dan published

48:48.920 --> 48:50.840
was based on fraudulent data?

48:50.880 --> 48:52.040
What?

48:52.080 --> 48:53.920
HUMPHREY: A bit like that, I suppose.

48:53.960 --> 48:57.440
Which brings us to you, Jonathan.

48:53.960 --> 48:57.440
Because we can well imagine

48:57.480 --> 49:00.200
why you needed Dan dead as soon as possible.

49:00.240 --> 49:02.680
-I didn't kill him! -HUMPHREY: I know.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.320
Because it wouldn't make sense to kill Dan

49:04.360 --> 49:06.640
before you'd found the cocaine that incriminated you.

49:08.040 --> 49:11.200
So that leaves only you, Nicky.

49:08.040 --> 49:11.200
And I have to say

49:11.240 --> 49:15.160
that all along, you felt like

49:11.240 --> 49:15.160
our most likely killer.

49:15.200 --> 49:18.360
The jilted lover who still carried a flame.

49:19.040 --> 49:20.360
And yet, I now know

49:21.360 --> 49:23.240
you didn't shoot Dan dead, either.

49:23.280 --> 49:26.320
But if she didn't kill him, then who did?

49:26.360 --> 49:27.960
Well, to understand the who,

49:28.000 --> 49:32.080
we first need to understand just how Dan Hagen was killed.

49:32.120 --> 49:33.720
<i>Now, you were all</i> <i>in each other's sight</i>

49:33.760 --> 49:35.800
<i>the whole time</i> <i>you were under water.</i>

49:35.840 --> 49:37.880
Yet one of you managed to swim back to the boat,

49:37.920 --> 49:40.240
commit murder, trash the boat and get back to the reef.

49:40.280 --> 49:43.720
And all without anyone noticing you'd left the reef.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.240
That's intriguing, isn't it?

49:46.600 --> 49:49.000
Impossible, even.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.200
Wouldn't you say so...

49:51.240 --> 49:52.920
Laura?

49:54.680 --> 49:58.960
-It was you who

49:54.680 --> 49:58.960
shot your husband dead.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.400
But that's not possible. If she'd tried to swim

49:59.000 --> 50:02.400
back to the boat,

50:02.440 --> 50:05.000
-then we'd have seen. -HUMPHREY: I know.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.800
But that's not when Dan Hagen was killed.

50:07.840 --> 50:11.880
Because this is when I finally realised

50:07.840 --> 50:11.880
no one left the reef.

50:13.440 --> 50:17.560
Dan Hagen was dead before you all went diving.

50:17.600 --> 50:21.840
He wasn't. He was still alive, in the cabin where I left him.

50:21.880 --> 50:25.560
That's true. And Laura was only in there

50:21.880 --> 50:25.560
for a few seconds.

50:25.600 --> 50:27.000
Sam's right.

50:27.040 --> 50:30.840
God knows I don't like the woman,

50:27.040 --> 50:30.840
but I can't lie.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.240
Dan was still alive when Laura left the cabin.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.560
I saw both of them with my own eyes.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.680
And this is where the two barbers come in.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.440
Who in that town would get their hair cut

50:40.360 --> 50:42.440
by the bad barber?

50:42.480 --> 50:44.440
The answer is, of course, the good barber.

50:44.480 --> 50:46.440
'Cause he can't cut his own hair, can he?

50:46.480 --> 50:48.120
Just as Laura couldn't commit murder on her own,

50:48.160 --> 50:51.440
she needed to have help from a second party.

50:51.480 --> 50:53.360
A second barber.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.200
That was you, Nicky.

50:58.320 --> 51:00.800
That's right. Laura and Nicky

51:00.840 --> 51:02.960
have been working together from the start.

51:04.240 --> 51:08.920
As this little toy soldier proves.

51:08.960 --> 51:11.400
A toy soldier we found near the body

51:11.440 --> 51:14.400
and yet didn't have any fingerprints on it.

51:14.440 --> 51:15.960
So how did it get on the boat?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.680
The reef wasn't clean when you first went there.

51:18.720 --> 51:21.600
On day one, you did a trash collection.

51:21.640 --> 51:25.440
Removing old bottles and other litter,

51:21.640 --> 51:25.440
like a toy soldier

51:25.480 --> 51:28.160
that a kid might have dropped overboard

51:25.480 --> 51:28.160
from their boat,

51:28.200 --> 51:30.000
which didn't have any fingerprints on it.

51:30.040 --> 51:33.320
But then, after long enough in the sea,

51:30.040 --> 51:33.320
fingerprints get eroded.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.360
So this is my question to you, Jonathan.

51:35.400 --> 51:37.440
After you cleared the reef,

51:37.480 --> 51:39.560
how did you get the litter back to the boat?

51:39.600 --> 51:41.400
In sample bags.

51:41.440 --> 51:44.600
And why did Laura go into the cabin the very

51:41.440 --> 51:44.600
last time she saw Dan?

51:44.640 --> 51:47.360
-To get a sample bag. -A sample bag

51:44.640 --> 51:47.360
she placed there earlier,

51:47.400 --> 51:51.280
which contained a silenced pistol.

51:51.320 --> 51:53.280
<i>She then hid</i> <i>Dan's wallet and watch.</i>

51:54.680 --> 51:56.040
<i>That way she could</i> <i>dispose of them later</i>

51:56.080 --> 51:58.040
<i>to make it look</i> <i>like a robbery gone wrong.</i>

52:00.240 --> 52:02.400
Laura and Nicky then contrived to make an excuse

52:02.440 --> 52:05.720
for Laura to go into the cabin just before the dive.

52:05.760 --> 52:07.440
I think you left it in the cabin.

52:07.480 --> 52:10.120
HUMPHREY:<i> Which is when Laura</i> <i>retrieved her sample bag.</i>

52:10.160 --> 52:11.680
Found it!

52:11.720 --> 52:15.440
<i>Not realising there was</i> <i>a piece of litter still in it,</i>

52:15.480 --> 52:18.440
<i>a toy soldier from the tidy-up</i> <i>the day before.</i>

52:20.440 --> 52:21.920
-Oh!

52:25.880 --> 52:29.960
<i>With Nicky watching</i> <i>from outside</i>

52:25.880 --> 52:29.960
<i>without saying a word.</i>

52:33.440 --> 52:34.920
NICKY: Come on, Laura!

52:35.960 --> 52:37.160
Let's go diving!

52:37.880 --> 52:39.280
No, I don't understand.

52:39.320 --> 52:41.240
Even if what you're saying is true,

52:41.280 --> 52:43.160
Laura may have had time to kill Dan

52:43.200 --> 52:45.240
but there's no way she could also have

52:43.200 --> 52:45.240
trashed the cabin.

52:45.280 --> 52:49.520
Ah, yes. But just as Dan Hagen was killed before

52:45.280 --> 52:49.520
we thought possible,

52:49.560 --> 52:52.400
the cabin was smashed up

52:52.440 --> 52:54.600
after we thought possible.

52:54.640 --> 52:56.280
After your dive, in fact.

52:56.320 --> 52:59.280
When Nicky made sure it was her who discovered

52:56.320 --> 52:59.280
the body,

52:59.320 --> 53:02.760
while the rest of you were still getting out

52:59.320 --> 53:02.760
of your dive kit.

53:02.800 --> 53:04.040
I'll get him.

53:11.840 --> 53:14.280
But why would Nicky help Laura?

53:14.960 --> 53:16.440
They hate each other.

53:16.480 --> 53:18.560
Laura told us she was working as a flight attendant

53:18.600 --> 53:21.760
on the Saint-Marie-to-Heathrow route when she met Dan.

53:22.760 --> 53:24.440
But if that was the case,

53:24.480 --> 53:26.920
and we should have realised,

53:26.960 --> 53:29.600
she could also have been on the same route

53:26.960 --> 53:29.600
a few weeks earlier

53:29.640 --> 53:33.000
when Nicky returned to the UK, having just been dumped

53:29.640 --> 53:33.000
by Dan Hagen.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.720
When you saw a woman. Hmm?

53:37.760 --> 53:39.040
Travelling alone in first class.

53:39.080 --> 53:41.800
Upset, perhaps. Vulnerable, for definite.

53:41.840 --> 53:44.240
And you got talking.

53:44.280 --> 53:47.640
'Cause you're not the sweet innocent

53:44.280 --> 53:47.640
you pretend to be.

53:47.680 --> 53:52.040
You are a cold-hearted manipulator, someone who

53:47.680 --> 53:52.040
preys on the weak.

53:52.080 --> 53:54.000
And while we found out that you were

53:52.080 --> 53:54.000
kicked out of school

53:54.040 --> 53:55.400
for having an affair with a teacher,

53:55.440 --> 53:58.240
it took a phone call to your old school

53:58.280 --> 54:02.320
to ask the one question that mattered.

54:02.360 --> 54:06.360
The teacher you had an affair with

54:02.360 --> 54:06.360
was a woman.

54:09.920 --> 54:11.640
HUMPHREY: You and Laura became lovers.

54:11.680 --> 54:14.560
Laura very much in charge.

54:14.600 --> 54:17.320
I'm guessing it was her that got you

54:14.600 --> 54:17.320
to agree to her plan,

54:17.360 --> 54:20.240
that you'd give her all the inside information

54:17.360 --> 54:20.240
on Dan

54:20.280 --> 54:21.800
so she could seduce him.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.560
What he liked, what he disliked,

54:21.840 --> 54:23.560
what he found funny.

54:23.600 --> 54:27.320
We have the same sense of humour,

54:23.600 --> 54:27.320
the same interests.

54:27.360 --> 54:29.240
And you made sure you were working

54:27.360 --> 54:29.240
on Dan's flight

54:29.280 --> 54:31.400
when you flew back to the UK.

54:31.440 --> 54:34.760
And primed with Nicky's insight and knowledge,

54:34.800 --> 54:37.440
you were able to dazzle, entrap him.

54:37.480 --> 54:41.480
And then, all Nicky had to do was make sure she

54:37.480 --> 54:41.480
got back her old job

54:41.520 --> 54:43.800
on the next research mission to Saint-Marie.

54:43.840 --> 54:46.320
Because, I mean, if you're looking

54:43.840 --> 54:46.320
for two people

54:46.360 --> 54:48.480
who would never be accomplices,

54:48.520 --> 54:51.160
well, then, you'd be hard-pressed to find

54:48.520 --> 54:51.160
anyone more unlikely

54:51.200 --> 54:53.600
than the left-on-the-shelf ex-girlfriend

54:53.640 --> 54:55.960
and the young beauty who replaced her.

54:57.200 --> 54:58.760
SAM: But why?

54:58.800 --> 55:00.200
Why would they do this?

55:00.240 --> 55:02.480
Why would anyone want to kill a multi

55:03.800 --> 55:06.280
As for proof, we've spoken to your flatmate,

55:06.320 --> 55:09.680
who overheard a phone call you made while you were upset.

55:09.720 --> 55:14.600
Only she, and we, presumed that this call was to your ex,

55:09.720 --> 55:14.600
Dan Hagen.

55:16.880 --> 55:19.760
But as a copy of your house's

55:16.880 --> 55:19.760
phone bill proves,

55:19.800 --> 55:21.520
the number you dialled that night wasn't Dan's,

55:21.560 --> 55:24.000
it was Laura's.

55:24.040 --> 55:27.600
And a phone call that lasted 47 minutes.

55:27.640 --> 55:29.760
You were overheard professing your undying love to her

55:29.800 --> 55:31.760
over and over.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.080
-I'm so sorry. -Don't say a word.

55:36.120 --> 55:38.480
J.P., Dwayne, take them away.

56:00.440 --> 56:04.440
-Okay, so breaststroke is easiest.

56:04.480 --> 56:06.240
Do you think we'll be okay?

56:06.280 --> 56:08.800
Grew up on an island, how on earth did he

56:06.280 --> 56:08.800
never learn to swim?

56:08.840 --> 56:11.320
I've got no idea!

56:11.360 --> 56:13.880
-Hold on. More water, Chief. -Yes.

56:13.920 --> 56:16.280
-DWAYNE: Quick, water, water! -Yes, Dwayne.

56:13.920 --> 56:16.280
Yes, yes, coming.

56:17.320 --> 56:19.200
What did... Oh!

56:20.240 --> 56:21.920
Erm, sorry.

56:21.960 --> 56:24.960
Water, paraffin. Don't worry. I've got it now.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.080
-Grab the bowl, man! -Yes, yes, sorry.

56:33.760 --> 56:35.400
-So, Chief... -Yes.

56:35.440 --> 56:36.840
Tell me something.

56:36.880 --> 56:40.160
What exactly did the name Nancy remind you of?

56:40.200 --> 56:41.400
How do you mean?

56:41.440 --> 56:42.720
Well, it's just you said you had a neighbour

56:42.760 --> 56:44.440
who used to babysit for you called Nancy.

56:44.480 --> 56:46.880
Yes, but she wouldn't remind me of a boat.

56:46.920 --> 56:50.880
Well, she was... ...well,

56:46.920 --> 56:50.880
like an angel, really.

56:51.520 --> 56:53.320
Golden hair, legs that used

56:53.360 --> 56:55.160
to go on forever.

56:56.400 --> 57:00.840
-Er... -It's called

56:56.400 --> 57:00.840
transference, Chief.

57:00.880 --> 57:03.520
You don't need a boat. You need a woman.

57:03.560 --> 57:05.280
I do?

57:05.320 --> 57:07.800
Yes, well, it's a thought, isn't it?

57:07.840 --> 57:10.240
But how do I go about it, Dwayne?

57:07.840 --> 57:10.240
I mean,

57:10.280 --> 57:12.640
attracting women isn't really in my skillset.

57:12.680 --> 57:14.320
What are you talking about?

57:14.360 --> 57:17.520
You could have any woman on the island.

57:14.360 --> 57:17.520
You're a catch!

57:19.680 --> 57:21.120
Of course you are!

57:21.800 --> 57:23.520
Geez.

57:23.560 --> 57:25.720
Ah, Johnny Weissmuller.

57:25.760 --> 57:26.880
How did it go, then?

57:26.920 --> 57:29.000
Eh, pretty good.

57:29.760 --> 57:31.240
I hope.

57:31.280 --> 57:32.640
It's a start, anyway, you know?

57:32.680 --> 57:34.400
You did great!

57:36.120 --> 57:38.200
-HUMPHREY: Er,

57:36.120 --> 57:38.200
paraffin, Florence.

57:38.240 --> 57:41.480
It's paraffin prawns. It's a<i> specialite de region.</i>

57:45.880 --> 57:47.880
-A toast, then. -Ah.

57:49.600 --> 57:52.200
-To conquering your fears. -To conquering your fears.

57:52.240 --> 57:53.400
To conquering your fears. Dwayne.

57:56.360 --> 57:57.880
Come on, then.

57:57.920 --> 57:59.000
These prawns aren't going to eat themselves, you know.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.240
Let's eat.

58:01.360 --> 58:04.240
So, J.P., doggy paddle or backstroke?

58:04.280 --> 58:05.920
J.P.: Er...

58:10.240 --> 58:11.680
God, I need this.

58:12.960 --> 58:15.120
Ah! Someone get a doctor, now!

58:15.160 --> 58:18.240
Why would Spinner's Rock be a reason to kill

58:15.160 --> 58:18.240
Governor Bamber?

58:18.280 --> 58:21.600
<i>Dwayne, J.P.,</i> <i>I want you to visit</i>

58:18.280 --> 58:21.600
<i>this Spinner's Rock.</i>

58:21.640 --> 58:25.120
I reckon we'll find out exactly what it is

58:21.640 --> 58:25.120
from up there.

58:26.600 --> 58:27.880
<i>Ti mal!</i>
