male announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.541 --> 00:11.379
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.647
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.681 --> 00:15.616
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.649 --> 00:17.051
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.085 --> 00:18.786
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.422
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:21.455 --> 00:24.758
[loud dance music]

00:24.792 --> 00:33.367
*

00:40.841 --> 00:42.610
[volume decreases]

00:42.643 --> 00:45.079
- THE FEDS KEEP PUMPING MONEY
INTO THE RESERVE,

00:45.113 --> 00:46.714
AND INTEREST RATES STAY LOW.
- YEAH.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.617
BUT HOW LONG CAN THE IMF KEEP
BAILING OUT GREECE AND ITALY?

00:49.650 --> 00:50.851
- THEY JUST GOT TO HOLD OUT
UNTIL THE ELECTION.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.621
OH, YES.

00:53.654 --> 00:54.655
- OKAY.

00:54.688 --> 00:58.859
LET'S TAKE IT EASY
ON THE CHAMPAGNE, OKAY, HONEY?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.662
- WE GOT A SITUATION.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.504
- OFFICERS.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.106
OH, YOU GUYS
ARE WITH THE THIRD?

01:12.140 --> 01:14.508
MY DAD SPEAKS REAL HIGHLY
OF YOUR CAPTAIN.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.809
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

01:15.843 --> 01:17.878
- A NEIGHBOR CALLED IN
WITH A NOISE COMPLAINT.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.381
- COME ON, FELLAS,
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.815
I'M JUST THROWING
A LITTLE BACHELOR PARTY

01:21.849 --> 01:23.751
FOR MY BOY HERE.
- WE'LL TRY AND KEEP IT DOWN.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.120
- OKAY.
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

01:26.154 --> 01:29.290
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.491
- IT'S SHOWTIME, BABY.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.127
I'LL GET EVERYBODY INSIDE.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.796
[loud hip-hop music]
- WOW.

01:35.829 --> 01:43.837
*

01:52.813 --> 01:54.815
- YOU'VE TAKEN CARE
OF EVERYONE ALL NIGHT.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.717
LET ME TAKE CARE
OF YOU.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.119
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK
THEY'LL MISS US.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.332
- OH, THAT'S BETTER.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.610
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
- WHAT?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.645
- WAIT, WAIT.
- WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

02:24.678 --> 02:25.846
[gasps]

02:25.879 --> 02:27.748
- OH, MY GOD!
- OH, MY GOD.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.683
OKAY.
- OH, MY--OH!

02:29.717 --> 02:31.919
- OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
OH, GOD.

02:31.952 --> 02:35.689
IT'S OKAY.
LET ME JUST THINK.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.861
- PENTHOUSE OWNER
IS CLAYTON HANNIGAN.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.196
- CABLE NEWS HOST?

02:42.230 --> 02:43.831
- YEAH,
BACHELOR PARTY GONE WRONG.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.200
VICTIM'S
AN UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE--

02:46.234 --> 02:47.968
WHITE,
FOUND IN THE ROOFTOP POOL.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.871
- AND THE PRECINCT DECIDED
TO CALL SVU BECAUSE...?

02:50.904 --> 02:53.841
- MY CAPTAIN'S
NOT A RISK TAKER.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.809
- ANY GUESTS STICK AROUND?
- NOT ON PURPOSE.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.511
THEY WERE IN SUCH A HURRY
TO GET OUT,

02:57.545 --> 02:58.879
THEY OVERLOADED
THE PENTHOUSE ELEVATOR.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.748
IT'S BEEN STUCK
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

03:00.781 --> 03:04.452
- WELL, WHEN YOU GET THEM OUT,
BRING THEM UP.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.989
SHE LOOKS SO YOUNG.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.925
YOU FOUND HER?

03:11.959 --> 03:14.395
- NO.
A CATER WAITER DID.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.863
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
SKINNY-DIPPING OR SOMETHING.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.698
- ANYONE FIND HER CLOTHES?

03:17.731 --> 03:20.434
- ALL I KNOW IS I JUMPED IN,
PULLED HER OUT,

03:20.468 --> 03:22.002
DID MOUTH-TO-MOUTH,
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.971
- SHE WAS ONE OF YOUR GUESTS?
- OH, I DON'T KNOW HER.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.640
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
SOMEONE'S PLUS-ONE.

03:26.674 --> 03:27.875
- WELL, WE'LL NEED
YOUR INVITE LIST.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.710
- IT WAS MORE
OF A WORD-OF-MOUTH THING.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.912
- YOU'RE A JOURNALIST,
AREN'T YOU, MR. HANNIGAN?

03:31.945 --> 03:35.449
DO YOUR BEST TO RECONSTRUCT.
- HEY.

03:35.483 --> 03:36.817
I THINK WE FOUND OUT

03:36.850 --> 03:38.252
WHY THE LOCAL PRECINCT
DOESN'T WANT TO TOUCH THIS ONE.

03:38.286 --> 03:39.787
- WHO WAS
IN THE ELEVATOR?

03:39.820 --> 03:41.422
- ONE FORMER YANKEE,

03:41.455 --> 03:43.891
TWO CURRENT MAJOR LEAGUERS,
ONE NHL,

03:43.924 --> 03:46.960
TWO HEDGE FUND GUYS,
AND TWO SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.229
- THEN THERE'S THE BACHELOR...

03:53.033 --> 03:57.505
WILL BRADY,
POLICE COMMISSIONER'S SON.

04:48.889 --> 04:49.857
- I'VE SPOKEN
TO MY DAD.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.059
HE OBVIOUSLY TOLD ME
TO COOPERATE COMPLETELY.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.427
IT'S TERRIBLE
WHAT HAPPENED.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.294
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

04:54.328 --> 04:55.896
WHO THIS GIRL CAME
TO YOUR PARTY WITH

04:55.929 --> 04:57.498
OR WHO HIRED HER?

04:57.531 --> 04:59.500
- NO, YOU'D HAVE
TO ASK CLAYTON.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.435
I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE
WAS HIRED.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.103
AND IF THEY WERE,
THAT'S NOT A CRIME.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.840
- WELL, THE PROBLEM IS ALL YOU
GUYS CRAMMED INTO THAT ELEVATOR.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.843
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU WERE FLEEING THE SCENE.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.513
- I GET IT, DETECTIVE.
YOU'RE IN A TOUGH SPOT HERE.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.114
- EXCUSE ME?

05:14.147 --> 05:16.817
- WE APPRECIATE
THE COOPERATION, WILL.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.953
- WHATEVER I CAN DO,
CAPTAIN, BUT, UH...

05:19.987 --> 05:23.424
I SHOULD CALL MY FIANCEE
BEFORE THIS THING GOES VIRAL.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.092
- WILL BRADY AND I
WERE IN COLLEGE TOGETHER.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.394
I'M HIS BEST MAN.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.530
- AND THE DEAD GIRL
IN YOUR POOL?

05:29.563 --> 05:30.998
- TRAGIC.

05:31.031 --> 05:34.802
BUT LIKE I SAID,
I DON'T KNOW HER.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.539
- SO WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN THE BODY WAS DISCOVERED?

05:38.572 --> 05:40.140
- I WAS IN THE LIVING ROOM,
GIVING A TOAST.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.809
WILL AND ALL OUR GUESTS
WERE THERE.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.612
- INCLUDING THE GIRLS YOU HIRED?
- PARDON ME?

05:44.645 --> 05:46.514
- I MEAN, WHERE DID YOU GET
THOSE GIRLS--

05:46.547 --> 05:47.848
FROM A STRIP CLUB,
ESCORT SERVICE?

05:47.881 --> 05:49.917
- LOOK, I CAN'T KEEP SOMEONE

05:49.950 --> 05:52.019
FROM BRINGING A DATE
TO MY PARTY.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.588
- SO HOW ARE YOU DOING
ON THAT GUEST LIST?

05:56.557 --> 05:59.393
- [exhales sharply]
HER?

05:59.427 --> 06:02.162
MOSTLY, I REMEMBER
THE TOP OF HER HEAD.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.399
UH, SHE COULD BARELY TALK.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.401
- WHAT, LIKE SHE WAS ON
SOMETHING?

06:07.435 --> 06:09.503
- NOTHING
THAT I GAVE HER.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.905
- [sighs]

06:11.939 --> 06:15.976
- DO YOU EVER USE
YOUR HANDCUFFS IN BED?

06:16.009 --> 06:19.947
- YOU EVER, UH, GET LAID
WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT?

06:21.515 --> 06:23.183
- NINE GENTLEMEN STUCK
IN THE ELEVATOR,

06:23.216 --> 06:25.819
AND THEY'RE ALL DEAF,
DUMB, AND DUMBER.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.955
- AND ONE SUIT SAYS
THAT THE VIC SEEMED WOOZY.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.457
- WE'RE PULLING
SECURITY FOOTAGE

06:29.490 --> 06:31.592
FROM THE ELEVATOR
AND THE LOBBY CAMS.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.094
- IT WAS A BACHELOR PARTY.
I MEAN, GUYS FILM THE ACTION.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.195
WE SHOULD CONFISCATE
CELL PHONES.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.565
- THESE PEOPLE?
NOT WITHOUT A WARRANT.

06:37.598 --> 06:42.536
NO, LET'S JUST SLOW DOWN
TILL WE HEAR FROM THE M.E.

06:42.570 --> 06:45.439
- CAPTAIN, WHY ARE WE TREADING
SO LIGHTLY?

06:45.473 --> 06:50.043
- THE HARDER WE PUSH,
THE QUICKER THEY LAWYER UP.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.947
- [sighs]

06:53.981 --> 06:57.217
- I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU HOME.

06:57.250 --> 07:01.889
- I SPENT THE NIGHT TALKING
TO RICH DRUNKS.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.558
I GOT AN HOUR BREAK.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.495
FIGURED I'D SLEEP.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.103
WHAT?
- NOTHING.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.106
IT'S JUST YOU'VE BEEN NAPPING
AT THE PRECINCT LATELY.

07:19.139 --> 07:23.911
- THE BREAK ROOM STINKS
OF DIRTY LAUNDRY.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.446
I WANTED TO SEE ZARA.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.486
- NICK, YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS

07:32.520 --> 07:34.488
AT SOME POINT, RIGHT?

07:42.730 --> 07:46.500
- I KNOW.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.610
- SHE DIDN'T DROWN.
THERE'S NO WATER IN HER LUNGS.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.647
SHE DIED FROM A LETHAL OVERDOSE
OF SCOPOLAMINE.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.015
- ISN'T THAT
FOR SEASICKNESS?

08:02.049 --> 08:03.651
- AND A FEW OTHER
MEDICAL CONDITIONS--

08:03.684 --> 08:05.185
NONE OF WHICH SHOWED UP
ON AUTOPSY.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.187
- I'VE SEEN IT USED
AS A MICKEY FINN.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.956
WORKING GIRLS SLIP IT
TO THEIR JOHNS.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.124
- SO SOMEBODY TURNED
THE TABLES ON HER.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.660
WE'RE LOOKING
AT A HOMICIDE HERE.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.194
- MAYBE.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.295
THERE'S NO SIGNS
OF TRAUMA

08:15.328 --> 08:17.297
EXCEPT FOR ABRASIONS
ON HER KNEES.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.267
SEMEN IN HER MOUTH
AND THROAT

08:20.300 --> 08:22.269
AND 2 1/2 OUNCES
IN HER STOMACH CONTENTS.

08:22.302 --> 08:25.072
- THAT'S MORE THAN ONE GUY.
THIS GIRL WAS WORKING HARD.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.776
- YEAH, BUT NOTHING INCONSISTENT
WITH CONSENSUAL ENCOUNTERS.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.210
I'M KICKING THIS BACK
TO YOU.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.311
IT'S A CUPPI.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.214
- A PENDING POLICE
INVESTIGATION?

08:34.247 --> 08:37.250
YOU TOLD US SHE WAS DEAD
WHEN SHE WENT INTO THAT POOL.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.020
- SOMEBODY MOVING THE BODY
DOESN'T PROVE HOMICIDE.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.154
THAT'S YOUR JOB.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.656
- THANKS A LOT.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.992
- MELINDA...

08:45.025 --> 08:48.095
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO
TO HELP US I.D. THIS GIRL?

08:48.128 --> 08:50.263
- SHE HAD SILICONE
BREAST IMPLANTS.

08:50.297 --> 08:53.233
WE'RE TRACKING
THE SERIAL NUMBER.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.768
- WE RESPOND TO A NOISE
COMPLAINT AT 2:20.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.037
WE ISSUE A STERN WARNING.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.706
- AND THE SECOND CALL
AT 3:50?

08:58.739 --> 09:01.575
- FEMALE,
NO NAME, SPANISH ACCENT--

09:01.609 --> 09:03.577
SAYS THERE'S A GIRL
NEEDING MEDICAL ATTENTION.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.012
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.647
THAT WAS BEFORE
CLAYTON HANNIGAN CALLED

09:06.680 --> 09:08.081
ABOUT THE BODY
IN THE POOL?

09:08.115 --> 09:10.083
- WHILE EN ROUTE,
WE GET HIS CALL.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.119
MY PARTNER ATTENDS
TO THE DECEASED

09:12.152 --> 09:13.320
WHILE I SECURE
THE PREMISES.

09:13.353 --> 09:18.091
- AND YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS THE COMMISSIONER'S SON?

09:18.125 --> 09:20.360
- FIRST I HEARD OF IT WAS
WHEN THE WHITE SHIRTS SHOWED UP.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.528
WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED ANYWAY.

09:21.561 --> 09:25.232
AS MY CAPTAIN SAYS, "ALL MEN
ARE EQUAL UNDER THE LAW."

09:25.265 --> 09:27.067
- FIN,

09:27.100 --> 09:29.302
NICK...

09:31.805 --> 09:34.007
THOSE TWO GUYS
GIVE YOU ANYTHING?

09:34.041 --> 09:36.243
- THEY'RE WELL REHEARSED.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.145
- WE GOT A HIT ON OUR VIC'S
BREAST IMPLANTS.

09:38.178 --> 09:42.282
HER PLASTIC SURGEON I.D.'D HER
AS MAGGIE MURPHY FROM WINNIPEG.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.852
SHE'S 16.
- 16, AND HE GAVE HER IMPLANTS.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.220
- LIV, WE CAN'T PROSECUTE
A WINNIPEG SURGEON.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.321
HOW DID SHE GET HERE?

09:48.355 --> 09:50.724
- SHE RAN AWAY FROM
HER FOSTER HOME SIX MONTHS AGO.

09:50.758 --> 09:54.227
SHE HAD HER SSI CHECKS FORWARDED
TO AN ADDRESS IN ASTORIA.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.296
- CSU AND TARU
ARE AT MAGGIE'S SUBLET--

09:56.329 --> 09:58.632
NO ROOMMATES, NEIGHBORS
DON'T SEEM TO KNOW HER.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.267
- SHE ONLY HAD ONE FRIEND
AT THE PARTY,

10:00.300 --> 10:02.402
AN UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE
WITH A SPANISH ACCENT.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.272
SHE CALLED 911
ABOUT A SICK GIRL.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.308
- WELL, WHERE ARE WE
ON I.D.'ING THE STRIPPERS?

10:10.343 --> 10:14.147
- THESE WOMEN CERTAINLY KNOW HOW
TO DODGE A SECURITY CAMERA.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.283
- AND THE INVITE LIST?

10:16.316 --> 10:18.318
- OH, THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
ARE BEING DEBRIEFED

10:18.351 --> 10:19.386
BY HOMELAND SECURITY.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.422
"IF WE HAVE ANYTHING PERTINENT
TO YOUR INVESTIGATION,

10:22.455 --> 10:23.691
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW."

10:23.724 --> 10:25.225
- ANYBODY ELSE?

10:25.258 --> 10:27.294
- GOALIE'S BACK IN CANADA.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.329
THE BALLPLAYERS
ARE AT THE STADIUM,

10:29.362 --> 10:32.065
HUNG OVER
IN FRONT OF 50,000 FANS.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.300
- I MEAN, THEY'RE RICH
AND POWERFUL.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.168
THEY KNOW HOW TO DUCK
AND COVER.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.904
- BUT THE GIRL'S BODY
WAS MOVED.

10:36.937 --> 10:40.173
THAT MAKES CLAYTON'S PENTHOUSE
A CRIME SCENE.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.408
GO BACK WITH CSU.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.845
IT'S SUNDAY.
THE GARBAGE HASN'T GONE OUT.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.847
- CAPTAIN, WE'RE ALSO LOOKING
AT MULTIPLE COUNTS

10:46.880 --> 10:48.181
OF STATUTORY RAPE.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.817
- WELL, THAT'S
THE D.A.'S CALL.

10:49.850 --> 10:53.086
FOR NOW, WE JUST FOCUS
ON HOW SHE DIED.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.325
- WE NEED TO GO
AFTER THESE GUYS.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.761
MAGGIE MURPHY WAS 16.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.196
SHE SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT
ON HER KNEES.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.798
[knock on door]

11:04.832 --> 11:08.201
- CAPTAIN.
- COUNSELOR.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.903
THANKS FOR COMING IN, WILL.
- OF COURSE.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.304
ONCE YOU TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT GIRL,

11:11.338 --> 11:13.807
I WANTED TO HELP
ANY WAY I COULD.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.309
- THIS IS A U.S.B. DRIVE
WHICH CONTAINS FOOTAGE

11:16.343 --> 11:19.913
OF ALL MY CLIENT'S ACTIVITY
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PARTY,

11:19.947 --> 11:22.750
PROVING THAT HE WAS NEVER
WITH THE VICTIM.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.387
[overlapping shouts and cheers]

11:33.861 --> 11:36.830
- AGAIN, MY CLIENT
IS NEVER ALONE.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.466
- I THINK
WE GET THE IDEA.

11:39.499 --> 11:43.236
SO THIS GIRL--
MAGGIE MURPHY--

11:43.270 --> 11:46.306
DID YOU SEE HER
WITH ANY OTHER GUESTS?

11:46.339 --> 11:48.341
- NO ONE SPECIFIC
I RECALL.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.744
- IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU DO RECALL?

11:50.778 --> 11:52.245
- LIV.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, CAPTAIN.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.480
I KNOW
SHE'S DOING HER JOB.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.950
UM, LOOK,
THE GIRL SEEMED OUT OF IT.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.152
UM, SHE WAS SLOPPY.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.889
I MEAN, I SAW HER MAKING OUT
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN--

12:01.922 --> 12:04.391
A TALL, TAN BRUNETTE.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.226
- OKAY, WILL,
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND

12:06.259 --> 12:08.361
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH
ALL OF THIS FOOTAGE.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.463
WHAT IS IT--
FOUR, FIVE HOURS?

12:10.497 --> 12:12.800
- MORE LIKE EIGHT.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.368
HEY, YOU ONLY GET MARRIED
FOR THE FIRST TIME ONCE.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.841
- LONG NIGHT
FOR THESE GIRLS.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.542
- AND GUYS LIKE THIS,

12:22.575 --> 12:26.246
THEY ACTUALLY THINK THESE GIRLS
DON'T SEE THEM AS JOHNS.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.549
- NEVER UNDERESTIMATE MAN'S
CAPACITY FOR SELF-DELUSION.

12:29.582 --> 12:33.286
- DON'T TELL ME YOU NEVER BEEN
TO A STRIP CLUB.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.923
- ON THE JOB, A LOT...

12:35.956 --> 12:37.891
MY COUSIN'S BACHELOR PARTY.

12:37.925 --> 12:42.362
BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU,
IT MAKES ME FEEL...

12:42.395 --> 12:44.564
UNCOMFORTABLE.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.333
- OH, YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE GUYS.
YEAH.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.935
TURNS DOWN
THE LAP DANCE,

12:47.968 --> 12:50.337
TELLS THE STRIPPER
SHE HAS BETTER CHOICES

12:50.370 --> 12:52.405
SHE CAN MAKE WITH HER LIFE.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.274
- YOU KNOW,
I RESPECT WOMEN.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.510
I GREW UP WITH SISTERS.
I GOT A DAUGHTER, MAN.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.913
- FELLAS,
I THINK I GOT SOMETHING.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.016
THE TIME STAMP
WAS ENCODED 3:25 A.M.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.819
MAGGIE EXITS THE LIVING ROOM.
- MM-HMM.

13:05.853 --> 13:08.355
HEADING WHERE?
- TO CLAYTON'S BEDROOM.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.490
- THE WAY SHE'S STAGGERING--
I MEAN,

13:10.523 --> 13:11.391
SHE'S ALREADY
ON HER WAY TO DIE.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.526
SHE'S ALREADY DOPED
WITH SCOPOLAMINE.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.595
- IS SHE ANYWHERE ELSE
IN THIS FOOTAGE?

13:15.628 --> 13:18.031
- NO, SHE DOESN'T APPEAR
ANYWHERE ELSE.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.466
BUT LOOK...

13:19.499 --> 13:22.469
- OKAY, CLAYTON
WITH A FRIEND.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.338
- IT'S A LITTLE BIT
AFTER MAGGIE LEFT--WATCH.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.040
THEY'RE HEADING
IN HER DIRECTION,

13:27.074 --> 13:29.609
TOWARDS THE BEDROOM
PRESUMABLY.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.378
- THAT'S A LITTLE THIN.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.380
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO CONVINCE HIM TO COME IN.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.248
- WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS?
CALL FROM THE LAB.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.984
THEY FOUND VOMIT ON SHEETS

13:37.017 --> 13:38.952
RECOVERED FROM THE TRASH
IN CLAYTON'S BUILDING.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.588
THEY'RE TESTING FOR SCOPOLAMINE.
- WHERE IS HE NOW?

13:41.621 --> 13:42.956
- I JUST TALKED
TO HIS NEWS DIRECTOR.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.391
HE'S TOLD ME CLAYTON'S
LEAVING TODAY

13:44.424 --> 13:45.425
TO COVER THE CRISIS
IN NORTH KOREA.

13:45.458 --> 13:48.361
- WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD
BECAUSE HE'S GOT A CRISIS

13:48.395 --> 13:49.262
BREAKING RIGHT HERE.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.498
I'LL HAVE PORT AUTHORITY
HOLD THE PLANE.

13:51.531 --> 13:55.002
GO PICK HIM UP.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.970
- CAPTAIN...

13:57.004 --> 13:59.006
THIS FOOTAGE
LETS WILL OFF THE HOOK.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.407
WE CAN KEEP THE CASE.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.443
- I'M TRYING.

14:03.476 --> 14:08.015
1PP WANTS THE D.A.'S OFFICE
TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATION.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.917
- OR BURY IT.

14:09.950 --> 14:13.120
I WILL CALL DAVID HADEN.
HE WILL BACK US.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.588
- DON'T.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.425
YOU KNOW WHERE THIS GOES, LIV.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.427
THAT GUEST LIST,
THE COMMISSIONER'S SON--

14:20.460 --> 14:21.929
TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.932
THOSE GIRLS HAVE OTHER CLIENTS--

14:24.965 --> 14:27.467
POLITICIANS, D.A.s, BRASS.

14:30.037 --> 14:33.440
- SO WE LET SOMEONE
GET AWAY WITH MURDER?

14:35.075 --> 14:39.512
- WE PLAY OUR CARDS CLOSE
TO THE VEST.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.356
[door opens]

14:58.465 --> 15:00.033
- MY CLIENT WILL TELL YOU
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.336
- GOOD. WHO HELPED YOU PUT
MAGGIE'S BODY IN THE POOL?

15:03.370 --> 15:05.038
- THERE WERE SOME
MIDDLE EASTERN DIPLOMATS THERE.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.573
THEIR SECURITY GUYS HELPED.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.541
- SO MORE WITNESSES
WE CAN'T TALK TO.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.676
- I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.544
- LIKE YOU DID
THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY?

15:11.578 --> 15:15.282
THE WET SUIT, DIVING IN
TO SAVE HER WAS A NICE TOUCH.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.018
- THAT WAS THE WRONG MOVE,
OBVIOUSLY.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.552
BUT SHE WAS DEAD
WHEN I FOUND HER.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.289
- SO WHY DON'T WE BACKTRACK?

15:22.322 --> 15:23.556
TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.592
- OKAY.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.327
I TOOK A BREAK
FROM THE PARTY,

15:27.360 --> 15:29.362
WENT TO MY ROOM...

15:29.396 --> 15:32.332
AND THE GIRL--
SHE WAS IN MY BED, DEAD.

15:32.365 --> 15:37.037
- AND YOU DECIDED NOT TO CALL
911 RIGHT WAY BECAUSE...?

15:37.070 --> 15:39.306
- SECRET SERVICE NEEDED
TO ESCORT A FEW OF THE GUESTS

15:39.339 --> 15:40.640
THROUGH THE SERVICE ELEVATOR.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.742
- THAT WAY,
THERE ARE NO CAMERAS.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.277
- RIGHT.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.514
- NOW, DID YOU KNOW
SHE WAS 16?

15:47.547 --> 15:50.117
- I DIDN'T I.D. PEOPLE
AT THE DOOR.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.651
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.320
FROM THE M.E.'S REPORT,

15:53.353 --> 15:55.388
AT LEAST FIVE
OF YOUR FRIENDS HAD SEX

15:55.422 --> 15:57.290
WITH AN UNDERAGE GIRL--
MAYBE YOU DID TOO.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.291
- I DIDN'T TOUCH HER.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.327
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THIS GIRL WAS AT MY PARTY

16:00.360 --> 16:01.694
UNTIL SHE WAS DEAD
IN MY BED.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.630
- ANYBODY CONFIRM YOUR STORY?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.999
OR DID YOU GO
INTO YOUR BEDROOM ALONE?

16:06.033 --> 16:08.468
- YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR IMAGE, MR. HANNIGAN--

16:08.501 --> 16:10.770
BEING WITH AN ESCORT?
WE'RE WAY PAST THAT.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.671
- FALSIFYING
A CRIME SCENE,

16:11.704 --> 16:13.673
ACCOMPLICE
TO UNDERAGE SEX TRAFFICKING.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.475
- THE THREATS AREN'T NECESSARY.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.611
CLAYTON?

16:18.645 --> 16:21.148
- SHE'S NOT AN ESCORT.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.116
SHE'S A FRIEND.
- GREAT.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.384
WE'LL NEED
HER NAME AND NUMBER.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.518
- CARISSA.

16:25.552 --> 16:29.122
[pen scratching]

16:29.156 --> 16:31.324
I DON'T KNOW HER LAST NAME.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.393
- OH, SO A CLOSE FRIEND.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.164
NOW, YOU MAY WANT TO WAIT
FOR YOUR LAWYER.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.767
BUT ONCE HE SHOWS,
WE CAN'T HELP YOU.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.436
- AM I BEING CHARGED
WITH SOMETHING?

16:43.470 --> 16:45.338
- NOT YET.

16:45.372 --> 16:48.341
- WE JUST HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS, CARISSA.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.378
- I'D STILL FEEL BETTER
IF MY ATTORNEY WERE HERE.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.580
- OKAY.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.715
- COULD I GET SOMETHING
TO DRINK, DETECTIVE...

16:55.748 --> 16:58.351
AMARO, WAS IT?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.389
- UH, YEAH,
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

17:02.422 --> 17:05.792
- SOME WATER WOULD BE GREAT.

17:05.825 --> 17:09.129
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU AROUND.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.630
- EXCUSE ME?

17:10.663 --> 17:13.433
- WE GET A LOT OF GUYS
ON THE JOB.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.402
YOU'RE MR. CLEAN?

17:19.572 --> 17:21.474
- WELL...

17:24.211 --> 17:25.612
I'M MARRIED, SO...

17:25.645 --> 17:27.780
- THAT'S NICE.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.417
AND YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
TEMPTED?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.685
- NO.

17:35.722 --> 17:39.092
- AH.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.794
[chuckles]
IT'S YOUR WIFE.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.599
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.801
- YES, YOU DO.

17:51.838 --> 17:55.442
SHE'S HURT YOU.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.810
HAVE YOU TOLD ANYONE?

17:59.612 --> 18:02.782
MM.
IT'S BOTTLING UP INSIDE YOU.

18:02.815 --> 18:06.553
YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO LET GO OF THAT.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.791
SOMETIMES EVENING THE SCORE,
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.697
[knock on door]

18:31.211 --> 18:34.181
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

18:34.214 --> 18:37.150
- WITNESS STARTS TALKING,
I LISTEN.

18:37.184 --> 18:39.852
- ABOUT THE CASE, OKAY.
THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

18:39.886 --> 18:44.691
- WELL, YOU KNOW, CAPTAIN,
SOMETIMES THAT'S HOW IT STARTS.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.793
- WE'RE GONNA WAIT
FOR HER LAWYER.

18:46.826 --> 18:50.897
LAST THING WE NEED RIGHT NOW
IS EVEN THE HINT OF IMPROPRIETY.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.640
- MS. GIBSON DIDN'T KNOW
THE VICTIM.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.309
SHE BARELY SAW HER
THAT NIGHT.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.610
TELL THEM, SWEETHEART.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.812
- I ASSUMED
SHE WAS SOMEBODY'S DATE.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.180
- MM-HMM.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.815
BUT YOU WERE
WITH CLAYTON HANNIGAN

19:08.848 --> 19:10.217
WHEN YOU DISCOVERED
THE BODY?

19:10.250 --> 19:11.751
- AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,

19:11.784 --> 19:14.554
HE CALLED ALL THE SHOTS
FROM THAT POINT FORWARD.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.422
- HOW ABOUT BEFORE THAT?

19:15.455 --> 19:17.957
A WOMAN CALLED 911
ABOUT A SICK GIRL.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.192
- THAT WASN'T ME.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.159
- OKAY.

19:20.193 --> 19:23.263
[clears throat]
AND THE OTHER WOMEN THERE--

19:23.296 --> 19:27.267
YOU KNOW ANY OF THEM?

19:27.300 --> 19:29.202
- JUST TELL THE TRUTH,
CARISSA--

19:29.236 --> 19:33.506
THE WHOLE TRUTH
AND NOTHING BUT.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.542
- I KNEW ALL OF THEM
EXCEPT FOR THE GIRL.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.210
- AND MAY I ASK
WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE?

19:37.244 --> 19:38.578
- I'M AN ESCORT.

19:38.611 --> 19:42.215
I GET PAID TO GO TO DINNERS,
ATTEND PARTIES.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.817
- THERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL
ABOUT MY CLIENT'S BUSINESS.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.753
- IN THAT CASE,

19:46.786 --> 19:48.255
WE'LL NEED THE NAME
OF YOUR BOOKER.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.590
- WELL, THAT SHOULDN'T BE
A PROBLEM.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.659
I REPRESENT HIM AS WELL.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.665
- SEE THIS?
- UH-HUH.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.534
- THIS IS STEPHANIE
FROM NORTHERN NORTHERN VIRGINIA.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.570
I LIKE THE HAIR,
IF IT'S BACK THERE.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.238
"HAIR BACK THERE"--
I'M A POET!

20:05.272 --> 20:06.973
[chuckles]
OKAY.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.642
I MISS YOU.
I DO.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.612
[cell phone ringing]
- HELLO?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.647
YEAH.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.684
YEAH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.752
HEY, DANIELA.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.255
COME SEE ME LATER,
OKAY?

20:22.289 --> 20:24.924
- YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYBODY'S
GOT THAT MUCH TALENT.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.693
IF YOU GO ALONG
WITH THAT KIND OF HEIGHT--

20:26.726 --> 20:29.829
- BOSS, HEY.
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.631
- I'M KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING, CASSIDY.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.800
- WE GOT TO GO, NOW.

20:33.833 --> 20:37.937
CHOP-CHOP.
COME ON.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.772
- [chuckles]

20:39.806 --> 20:40.807
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.409
- WE NEED TO TALK
TO BART GANZEL.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.311
- OH, NOT A GOOD TIME,
DETECTIVES.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.745
- HEY, BART.
NYPD.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.381
- HEY, YOU GOT A WARRANT?
- YOU KIDDING ME?

20:48.415 --> 20:51.384
- HEY, GET THE HELL BACK.
- TAKE IT EASY.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.419
- LET ME SEE
SOME IDENTIFICATION.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.820
- I NEED TO SEE A WARRANT.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.289
- YOUR I.D. NOW.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.859
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

20:59.892 --> 21:02.295
- STAY DOWN.
STAY DOWN!

21:02.329 --> 21:03.430
YOU, HANDS ON YOUR HEAD.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.298
- [chuckles]

21:05.332 --> 21:07.300
[handcuffs clicking]

21:07.334 --> 21:08.968
- YOU JUST
GOT YOURSELF ARRESTED, PAL.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.003
- YEAH.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.878
- GANZEL THINKS
HE'S GOT EX-NYPD ON THE PAYROLL.

21:18.911 --> 21:19.779
I HAD TO MAKE IT
LOOK REAL.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.682
- YEAH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

21:22.715 --> 21:25.785
I WAS U.C. FOR YEARS.
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS.

21:25.818 --> 21:29.789
- I'M SORRY IF I HURT YOU.
- YOU DIDN'T HURT ME.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.959
SO WHO ARE YOU UNDERCOVER FOR,
HMM, INTERNAL AFFAIRS?

21:32.992 --> 21:34.694
- NEED-TO-KNOW.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.764
- CASSIDY, YOU ASS.

21:37.797 --> 21:38.965
YOU PUNCHED MY PARTNER?

21:38.998 --> 21:41.801
- NICE TO SEE YOU TOO,
OLIVIA.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.803
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.838
YOU LOOK GOOD.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.006
- WHAT, YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

21:47.039 --> 21:50.443
- USED TO WORK SVU...
LAST CENTURY.

21:50.477 --> 21:53.880
AND NOW YOU'RE MOONLIGHTING
FOR BART GANZEL.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.649
HE MENTION THE DEAD GIRL
AT HIS PARTY?

21:56.683 --> 21:57.984
- MIGHT HAVE COME UP.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.886
- AND YOU COULDN'T GIVE US
A CALL?

21:59.919 --> 22:01.888
- HEY, I'VE BEEN UNDER
FOR THREE YEARS.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.557
I'M NOT GONNA JEOPARDIZE THAT.

22:04.591 --> 22:06.826
- FOR A MURDER CHARGE,
SEX TRAFFICKING?

22:06.859 --> 22:08.761
- WE ALL HAVE
OUR MARCHING ORDERS.

22:08.795 --> 22:09.696
- YEAH, SO DO WE.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.931
SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT MAGGIE MURPHY?

22:11.964 --> 22:14.967
SHE ONE OF HIS REGULARS?

22:15.001 --> 22:15.902
- I DON'T KNOW THE NAME.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.838
AND I KNOW MOST
OF HIS GIRLS PRETTY WELL.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.507
- YEAH, I'LL BET.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.874
SO HOW'D SHE GET
INTO CLAYTON'S PARTY?

22:21.908 --> 22:23.943
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE A FRIEND BROUGHT HER.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.813
- WHO?
CARISSA?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.715
- DOUBTFUL.

22:28.748 --> 22:31.684
SHE'S THE QUEEN BEE.
HEY...

22:31.718 --> 22:32.852
I HEARD YOU TWO
HIT IT OFF.

22:32.885 --> 22:35.788
- HEY, BOYS,
ALL ON THE SAME SIDE HERE.

22:35.822 --> 22:38.024
- ARE WE?

22:38.057 --> 22:40.126
- WE NEED THE NAMES
OF EVERY ESCORT

22:40.159 --> 22:42.729
WHO WORKED THAT PARTY.

22:42.762 --> 22:45.732
- LOOK, MY BOSS
HAS EVERY REASON TO COOPERATE.

22:45.765 --> 22:46.766
GET THAT FROM HIM

22:46.799 --> 22:49.502
AND PUT ME IN RIKERS
FOR THE NIGHT.

22:49.536 --> 22:53.005
OTHERWISE
HE'S GONNA GET SUSPICIOUS.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.907
- IT'S ON YOU, LIV.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.911
AND ONE LAST THING--

22:58.945 --> 23:03.650
YOU AND GANZEL WERE CUTTING OUT
JUST AS WE GOT THERE.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.021
SOMEONE TIP YOU OFF?

23:09.055 --> 23:11.724
- WHO WOULD DO THAT?

23:20.132 --> 23:22.101
- HEY.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.603
- OH!

23:23.636 --> 23:25.872
YOU LIKE IT ROUGH, HUH?
- SHUT UP.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.041
- COME ON, GANZEL,
YOUR LAWYER'S HERE.

23:29.075 --> 23:32.545
THIS WAY.

23:32.579 --> 23:35.915
- THAT'S THE UNDERAGE GIRL
WHO DIED?

23:35.948 --> 23:38.651
THAT'S AWFUL.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.052
BUT NOT ONE
OF MY ESCORTS.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.789
NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE,
HAND TO GOD.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.757
- MY CLIENT WAS CONTRACTED
TO PROVIDE

23:44.791 --> 23:47.059
FEMALE ENTERTAINERS
FOR THE BACCHANAL--

23:47.093 --> 23:49.796
TO DANCE,
TALK TO THE GUESTS--

23:49.829 --> 23:53.933
NOTHING ILLEGAL,
AS DOCUMENTED HERE.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.803
ALL OVER 18.

23:56.836 --> 24:00.072
- IT WAS A HIGH-PROFILE EVENT,
LOTS OF SECURITY.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.808
ANY IDEA HOW MAGGIE GOT IN?

24:01.841 --> 24:02.942
- I WISH I KNEW.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.944
I CALLED EVERY ESCORT
I'D SENT.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.913
THEY ALL SWORE
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE GIRL,

24:06.946 --> 24:08.781
THAT SHE CAME WITH ANYA SOLAR.

24:08.815 --> 24:11.017
AND ANYA HASN'T CALLED ME BACK.

24:11.050 --> 24:14.220
- WHAT DOES ANYA LOOK LIKE?

24:14.253 --> 24:17.056
- BRUNETTE, TALL, TAN...

24:17.089 --> 24:19.826
HOT.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.829
- WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TALK
TO ANYA.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.931
- YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE HER?

24:27.900 --> 24:31.904
OH, MAN,
THAT JUST SUCKS.

24:34.073 --> 24:37.043
- TALL AND TAN...

24:37.076 --> 24:39.912
AND HOT.

24:39.946 --> 24:42.982
- YEAH, THIS IS ANYA SOLAR,
AKA ANYA SOLDAZ,

24:43.015 --> 24:45.785
AKA FOUR OTHER NAMES.

24:45.818 --> 24:46.886
SHE'S A COLOMBIAN NATIVE.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.721
SHE WAS HERE
ON A STUDENT VISA.

24:48.755 --> 24:49.656
SHE'S 23.

24:49.689 --> 24:52.091
SHE FLEW BACK TO CARTAGENA
SUNDAY MORNING.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.727
- SO WHO PAID
FOR HER TICKET--GANZEL?

24:54.761 --> 24:57.697
- MAYBE, IF HE PAID THROUGH
AN OFFSHORE SHELL ACCOUNT.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.131
- WE SEARCHED ANYA'S APARTMENT.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.332
SHE LEFT IN A HURRY.

25:00.366 --> 25:03.870
THE DOORMAN SAYS SHE RACED
IN AND OUT 7:00 A.M., SUNDAY.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.138
- WE FOUND THIS.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.740
THAT'S JUST LIKE THE ONE
IN THE VIDEO.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.108
- WITH THIS INSIDE.

25:09.141 --> 25:13.946
SCOPOLAMINE
MADE OUT TO ANYA BROWN.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.047
- SO IT WASN'T AN OVERDOSE.

25:15.081 --> 25:19.852
ANYA BRINGS MAGGIE TO THE PARTY
AND THEN DRUGS HER?

25:19.886 --> 25:21.087
- YEAH, WHY?

25:21.120 --> 25:23.890
IF SHE JUST WANTED MAGGIE DEAD,
THERE'S A HUNDRED EASIER WAYS.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.892
- SOMEONE WANTED A SCANDAL...

25:25.925 --> 25:28.895
TO HURT CLAYTON HANNIGAN
OR THE COMMISSIONER.

25:28.928 --> 25:29.762
I MEAN,
ANYA MUST HAVE BEEN

25:29.796 --> 25:31.898
THE ONE WHO MADE
THE SECOND 911 CALL.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.066
- CASSIDY SAYS HE KNOWS
ALL OF GANZEL'S GIRLS.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.068
THAT WOULD INCLUDE ANYA.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.705
- PICK HIM BACK UP.
- WE CAN'T.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.973
IT'LL BLOW HIS COVER.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.910
WE TREAT HIM
LIKE A HOSTILE WITNESS.

25:43.943 --> 25:46.178
- THAT WON'T BE HARD.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.181
[brooding rock music playing,
indistinct chatter]

25:49.215 --> 25:55.054
*

25:55.087 --> 25:57.056
THIS WHAT GANZEL PAYS YOU FOR?

25:57.089 --> 25:58.257
NICE LIFE.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.926
- I DO SOME SCOUTING
FROM TIME TO TIME.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.994
- THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE A CLASSIER ACT.

26:02.028 --> 26:04.096
- SOMETIMES YOU FIND
A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.866
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

26:06.899 --> 26:09.101
OH, GORGEOUS ANYA.
[chuckles]

26:09.135 --> 26:10.269
- HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW HER?

26:10.302 --> 26:11.938
- SHE DOESN'T REALLY OPEN UP
TO PEOPLE.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.305
- WELL, DID YOU KNOW
SHE LEFT THE COUNTRY

26:13.339 --> 26:16.743
SIX HOURS
AFTER MAGGIE DROWNED?

26:16.776 --> 26:20.046
- HOOKERS--
NEVER TRUST THEM, EVER.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.949
RISSA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- BOSS MISSES YOU.

26:22.982 --> 26:25.051
- YEAH? GIVE US A MINUTE,
BABY, WOULD YOU?

26:25.084 --> 26:26.185
- MM-HMM.
- ONE SECOND--

26:26.218 --> 26:28.054
YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

26:28.087 --> 26:31.724
WHY DON'T YOU GO
CATCH UP?

26:37.029 --> 26:39.966
- SHE CHECKING UP ON YOU?
- I DON'T BLAME GANZEL.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.968
SOMEBODY SET HIM UP GOOD.
- YEAH?

26:42.001 --> 26:44.103
YOU THINK
IT WAS ANYA'S IDEA?

26:44.136 --> 26:45.838
WHO'S SHE WORKING FOR?

26:45.872 --> 26:47.774
- SHE WAS ONE
OF DELIA WILSON'S TOP GIRLS

26:47.807 --> 26:49.308
UNTIL GANZEL TOOK HER AWAY.

26:49.341 --> 26:52.011
- DELIA WILSON?
I DON'T KNOW THE NAME.

26:52.044 --> 26:54.046
SHE RUNS AN ESCORT SERVICE?
- YEAH.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.949
VERY HIGH PROFILE,
VERY DISCREET,

26:56.983 --> 26:58.985
UPPER-ECHELON MATCHMAKING--

26:59.018 --> 27:03.122
CABINET MEMBERS, CEOs, BFDs.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.291
TWO EX-GOVERNORS HAVE HER NUMBER
ON THEIR SPEED DIAL.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.126
USED TO BE THE BIGGEST ONE
ON THE EAST COAST

27:07.159 --> 27:08.360
TILL GANZEL MOVED IN.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.863
HE'S GOT
THE HOTTEST GIRLS.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.866
SHE'S GOT THE MOST
HIGH-POWERED CLIENT LIST.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.334
- I DON'T KNOW ANYA WELL.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.269
- ANY IDEA WHO PAID
FOR HER PLANE TICKET?

27:17.303 --> 27:20.239
- NO.
AND I'D TELL YOU IF I DID.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.408
I FEEL LIKE
I COULD TELL YOU ANYTHING...

27:22.441 --> 27:23.976
LIKE I WANT TO.

27:24.010 --> 27:28.214
- LOOK, CARISSA, DON'T WORK ME.
- I'M NOT.

27:28.247 --> 27:31.083
AND I MEANT
WHAT I SAID BEFORE.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.986
IF YOU EVER WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING...

27:34.020 --> 27:37.156
OR MAYBE NOT TALK AT ALL...

27:37.189 --> 27:39.091
- YOU TRYING TO BRIBE
A POLICE OFFICER?

27:39.125 --> 27:43.062
- I JUST THINK
YOU NEED A FRIEND.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.998
THERE ARE THINGS YOU DON'T
EVEN TELL YOUR PARTNER,

27:46.032 --> 27:48.034
AREN'T THERE?

27:52.271 --> 27:55.274
- WHEN YOU WERE A GIRL,

27:55.307 --> 27:59.011
IS THIS THE LIFE
YOU ENVISIONED FOR YOURSELF?

28:03.082 --> 28:06.052
- BART AND I ARE ENGAGED.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.054
WE HAVEN'T GONE PUBLIC YET,

28:08.087 --> 28:10.990
BUT I'M GONNA BE FINE.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.192
- IT'LL CATCH UP WITH HIM
EVENTUALLY.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.962
AND, CARISSA,
YOU'LL GO DOWN TOO.

28:15.995 --> 28:19.465
- YOU LIKE SAVING WOMEN,
DETECTIVE?

28:19.498 --> 28:22.234
I GET THAT.

28:22.268 --> 28:26.372
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT TOO,
IF YOU WANT.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.410
- SO WHY IS DELIA GOING
AFTER GANZEL?

28:31.443 --> 28:33.145
- GANZEL'S THE NEW WORLD.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.014
SHE'S THE OLD.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.016
TWO MONTHS AGO, SHE SENT
SOME GOONS OVER TO THE LOFT.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.018
THEY MADE THREATS,
TOLD GANZEL

28:39.051 --> 28:42.054
TO STOP TAKING HER GIRLS,
HER CLIENTS.

28:42.088 --> 28:45.057
- AND NOW HE'S FIELDING
QUESTIONS FROM THE COPS

28:45.091 --> 28:47.059
ABOUT A DEAD GIRL.

28:47.093 --> 28:50.196
WHY DIDN'T HE TELL US THAT?

28:53.199 --> 28:55.467
BECAUSE HE WANTS
TO GO AFTER HER HIMSELF.

28:55.501 --> 28:59.238
- LOOK, IF YOU TWO ARE GONNA GO
AFTER DELIA WILSON,

28:59.271 --> 29:02.308
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.

29:02.341 --> 29:05.111
NOBODY--
AND I MEAN NOBODY--

29:05.144 --> 29:08.147
KNOWS HOW DEEP HER HOOKS GO.

29:11.483 --> 29:14.053
- DELIA'S OUT BACK.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.455
YOU SHOULD HAVE WORN BOOTS.
- WE'RE FINE.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.390
A LITTLE MUD'S
NOT GONNA KILL US.

29:18.424 --> 29:22.528
- IT'S MORE THAN MUD.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.064
- DELIA WILSON.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.266
- THANK YOU, IRIS.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.002
- I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

29:30.036 --> 29:32.338
HE'S ON A STRICT
FEEDING SCHEDULE.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.006
HE'S THREE DAYS OLD,

29:34.040 --> 29:36.075
HAD TO PUT HIS MOTHER DOWN--
POOR THING.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.044
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

29:38.077 --> 29:39.979
- DO YOU KNOW AN ANYA SOLAR?

29:40.012 --> 29:41.948
- I DON'T THINK SO.
SHOULD I?

29:41.981 --> 29:43.082
- WELL, WE HEARD
SHE WORKED FOR YOU.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.152
- IT DOESN'T RING A BELL.
- HOW ABOUT MAGGIE MURPHY?

29:46.185 --> 29:49.188
- NO.
CAN I ASK WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

29:49.221 --> 29:52.291
- CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH BART GANZEL?

29:52.324 --> 29:55.027
- [scoffs]
THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP.

29:55.061 --> 29:57.163
- BUT YOU KNOW HIM?
- WELL, I'VE HEARD OF HIM.

29:57.196 --> 30:01.033
HE DOESN'T EXACTLY KEEP
HIS PERSONAL AMBITIONS A SECRET.

30:01.067 --> 30:03.069
- BUT YOU ARE IN THE SAME LINE
OF WORK THAT HE IS.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.303
- I'M A MOTHER OF THREE.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.438
THAT, PLUS TAKING CARE
OF MY HUSBAND

30:06.472 --> 30:10.042
AND RUNNING THE FARM--
I BARELY HAVE TIME FOR MYSELF.

30:10.076 --> 30:12.044
IT'S NOT EASY
BEING A WORKING WOMAN,

30:12.078 --> 30:13.112
JUGGLING A LIFE.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.447
I'M SURE YOU CAN RELATE,
DETECTIVE.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.950
- BUT YOU DO FIND THE TIME
TO RUN AN ESCORT AGENCY.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.551
- IT'S A MATCHMAKING SERVICE.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.954
AND, UH, IT'S A HOBBY.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.222
- A HOBBY?

30:23.255 --> 30:26.458
MR. GANZEL TOLD US
YOU THREATENED HIM.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.194
YOU TRIED
TO SHUT HIM DOWN.

30:28.227 --> 30:31.397
- HE TOLD YOU THAT?
WHY ON EARTH?

30:31.430 --> 30:33.399
- HE'S UNDER THE IMPRESSION
A FEW OF THE WOMEN

30:33.432 --> 30:36.468
FROM YOUR MATCHMAKING SITE--
THERE'S SOME CROSSOVER THERE.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.004
- I WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.306
I'VE NEVER EVEN MET GANZEL.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.041
I TAKE IT
YOU'RE INVESTIGATING HIM?

30:42.074 --> 30:44.310
- ANYTHING YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TELL US?

30:44.343 --> 30:47.179
- I WISH I COULD.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.348
SEEMS LIKE A CRIMINAL TO ME.

30:49.381 --> 30:53.285
I'M SORRY YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY
FOR NOTHING, DETECTIVES.

30:53.319 --> 30:56.222
- I DON'T BUY
HER SUNNYBROOK FARM ACT.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.390
DELIA WILSON
PUT A DEAD UNDERAGE HOOKER

30:58.424 --> 31:01.193
IN CLAYTON'S BED
AS AN OPENING SALVO

31:01.227 --> 31:03.162
IN HER WAR
AGAINST BART GANZEL.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.098
- LIV, ON PAPER,
DELIA WILSON TEACHES

31:06.132 --> 31:07.499
AT HER CHILDREN'S
SUNDAY SCHOOL.

31:07.533 --> 31:10.202
SHE DRIVES THEM
TO SOCCER GAMES.

31:10.236 --> 31:15.374
NOW, IF SHE IS NEW YORK CITY'S
MOST NOTORIOUS MADAM,

31:15.407 --> 31:18.410
SHE IS PUTTING UP
QUITE A FRONT.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.246
- WELL, VICE INVESTIGATED HER
FOR FIVE YEARS.

31:20.279 --> 31:23.149
I'M TRYING TO GET HER FILES.
- WELL, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

31:23.182 --> 31:26.385
IF THEY HAD SOMETHING,
THEY WOULD HAVE MOVED ON IT.

31:26.418 --> 31:30.189
- YOU'RE TELLING ME TO DROP
A PERFECTLY GOOD LEAD?

31:33.125 --> 31:35.294
- THIS WAS SLID
UNDER MY APARTMENT DOOR.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.070
- LENA...

31:44.103 --> 31:46.138
WHEN YOU WERE UNDERCOVER--
THIS IS COMPLETELY LEGIT.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.406
- YOU KNOW THAT,
AND I KNOW THAT.

31:47.439 --> 31:50.209
BUT OUT OF CONTEXT,
IT LOOKS BAD.

31:50.242 --> 31:54.646
I'M GONNA HAVE TO RECUSE MYSELF
AND SVU FROM THIS CASE.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.683
- YOU'RE GONNA KICK THIS
UPSTAIRS TO 1PP?

31:57.716 --> 32:00.186
FOR ALL WE KNOW, THEY'RE THE
ONES WHO LEAKED THESE PHOTOS.

32:00.219 --> 32:03.622
- "FOR ALL WE KNOW" IS RIGHT.
[knock on door]

32:03.655 --> 32:07.093
- CAPTAIN,
WE'VE GOT A CALL.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.499
- THE ASSISTANT WAS HERE

32:13.532 --> 32:15.701
WORKING WITH THE FORMER GOVERNOR
ON HIS MEMOIRS,

32:15.734 --> 32:18.070
AND HE JUST HAS A HEART ATTACK?

32:18.104 --> 32:19.371
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.140
- WHY CALL SVU?

32:21.173 --> 32:22.641
- I'M NOT A SKILLED
SEX-CRIMES DETECTIVE

32:22.674 --> 32:25.177
LIKE YOU GUYS,
BUT MY SUSPICIONS WERE AROUSED

32:25.211 --> 32:27.179
WHEN I NOTICED THAT
THE FORMER GOVERNOR'S PANTS

32:27.213 --> 32:30.616
WERE UNZIPPED
AND ON BACKWARDS.

32:30.649 --> 32:34.286
- OKAY.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.027
- WE WERE EDITING
CHAPTER SEVEN--

32:41.060 --> 32:43.595
HIS FIRST
GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.297
HE JUST KEELED OVER.

32:45.331 --> 32:48.167
- DID HE GRAB HIS CHEST
OR HIS ARM?

32:48.200 --> 32:50.069
- NO.
[stutters] I DON'T KNOW.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.237
NOT THAT I RECALL.

32:51.270 --> 32:54.206
- DID YOU LOOSEN HIS CLOTHES?
- WHAT?

32:54.240 --> 32:55.407
- HIS PANTS
WERE ON BACKWARDS, HONEY.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.043
NOW, WHAT CHAPTER, AGAIN,
WAS THAT, THAT YOU WERE EDITING?

32:57.076 --> 32:58.310
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU THINK THAT I--

32:58.344 --> 33:00.479
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT YOUR PICTURE
IS ABOUT TO BE

33:00.512 --> 33:02.481
ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF EVERY NEW YORK PAPER

33:02.514 --> 33:04.183
IN A MATTER OF HOURS, SO...

33:04.216 --> 33:06.485
- THE GOVERNOR WAS...

33:06.518 --> 33:08.587
GETTING A MASSAGE
WHEN HE DIED.

33:08.620 --> 33:12.291
- FROM YOU?
- NO, NO, NOT--NOT ME.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.193
THE GOVERNOR'S AIDE
CALLED ME.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.794
[clears throat]
WE MET HERE.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.297
WE DRESSED
GOVERNOR FLETCHER.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.199
- SO HE WAS NAKED.

33:20.232 --> 33:24.236
- YES...

33:24.270 --> 33:26.705
ON THE COUCH--

33:26.738 --> 33:27.873
IT WAS SO UNDIGNIFIED.

33:27.906 --> 33:31.577
- OKAY, SO HIS AIDE ASKED YOU
TO SUPPLY A COVER STORY.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.679
- THE GOVERNOR
HAS A WIFE AND CHILDREN.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.814
THERE'S NO REASON WHY
THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT--

33:35.847 --> 33:38.250
- HE DIED GETTING
A HAPPY ENDING.

33:38.284 --> 33:40.719
WE'RE GONNA NEED THE NAME
OF THAT MASSEUSE.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.222
- UM, SHE WAS,
UM...

33:43.255 --> 33:45.557
J-JAPANESE, I THINK.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.827
HIS ROLODEX IS ON THE DESK.
- MA'AM?

33:48.860 --> 33:51.197
- AT LEAST
THAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.599
I'D HATE TO THINK HERS
WAS THE LAST FACE HE SAW

33:53.632 --> 33:56.635
BEFORE HE CHECKED OUT.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.571
- GOVERNOR FLETCHER WAS
WITH HIS YOUNG ASIAN MASSEUSE,

33:59.605 --> 34:03.575
AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO ASSUME
HE DIED OF LOW BLOOD PRESSURE...

34:03.609 --> 34:07.846
70 UNDER 25.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.582
- THAT'S NOT WHAT KILLED HIM?
- NO.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.784
IN ADDITION
TO HEART MEDS AND ALCOHOL,

34:12.818 --> 34:14.253
HE HAD 200 MILLIGRAMS

34:14.286 --> 34:16.355
OF AN ERECTILE-DYSFUNCTION DRUG
IN HIS SYSTEM.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.357
THAT'S FOUR TIMES
THE DOSAGE.

34:18.390 --> 34:21.660
PLUS EIGHT MILLIGRAMS
OF SCOPOLAMINE.

34:21.693 --> 34:25.197
- THE FORMER GOVERNOR
WAS MURDERED.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.337
NOTHING OF VALUE
WAS MISSING FROM HIS OFFICE.

34:31.370 --> 34:32.338
THIS WAS A HIT.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.641
- LOOK, YOUR BOY CASSIDY
ALL BUT OUTED FLETCHER

34:35.674 --> 34:37.243
AS ONE OF DELIA'S REGULARS.

34:37.276 --> 34:39.378
- DELIA'S NOT GONNA KILL
HER OWN CLIENT.

34:39.411 --> 34:42.414
- GANZEL MUST HAVE GOTTEN
TO THE MASSEUSE.

34:42.448 --> 34:46.285
DELIA STARTED A WAR.
HE'S STRIKING BACK.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.820
- NO, NO.
I DID NOT KILL MR. FLETCHER.

34:48.854 --> 34:51.390
- OKAY, WE KNOW YOU WERE THERE
IN THE TOWNHOUSE.

34:51.423 --> 34:54.426
WE FOUND YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ON THE DOORKNOB, THE PHONE--

34:54.460 --> 34:57.329
- I SEE HIM EVERY TUESDAY
AND THURSDAY, 8:00 P.M.

34:57.363 --> 34:58.297
HE HAD A BAD BACK.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.832
- STOP LYING, YUKO, OKAY?

35:00.866 --> 35:03.135
WE'LL REVOKE
YOUR WORK VISA.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.404
YOU CAN GO BACK TO JAPAN
AND TELL YOUR FAMILY WHY.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.306
- NO, PLEASE,
I TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.308
- YOU GIVE HIM DRUGS
TO KEEP HIM GOING?

35:09.341 --> 35:11.177
- WHAT?
NO!

35:11.210 --> 35:13.412
HE HAD A HEART CONDITION--
VERY BAD TO TAKE THOSE.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.913
- SOMEBODY SLIPPED HIM
THOSE PILLS.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.283
- NOT ME.

35:17.316 --> 35:20.386
WHEN I GOT THERE,
HE WAS LYING ON THE COUCH,

35:20.419 --> 35:23.622
NOT MOVING,
NOT BREATHING...

35:23.655 --> 35:24.723
NAKED.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.392
- YOU CALL 911?

35:26.425 --> 35:28.394
- I WAS AFRAID.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.196
I CALLED IRIS.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.864
- IRIS?
SHE WORKS FOR THE GOVERNOR?

35:32.898 --> 35:36.268
- NO, SHE'S MY BOOKER
AT THE AGENCY.

35:36.302 --> 35:40.472
SHE SAID TO JUST GO,
SO I GO.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.908
HE WAS A VERY NICE MAN--

35:42.941 --> 35:46.812
VERY GENEROUS AND VERY QUICK.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.814
- YUKO CALLED, PANICKED.

35:48.847 --> 35:51.650
I TOLD HER TO LEAVE, AND
I CALLED THE GOVERNOR'S AIDE.

35:51.683 --> 35:54.653
- THE GOVERNOR'S AIDE
DENIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS.

35:54.686 --> 35:57.356
- OF COURSE HE DID.
CHECK MY CELL PHONE.

35:57.389 --> 36:00.326
WHY WOULD I LIE ABOUT THAT?
- WHY NOT?

36:00.359 --> 36:03.395
YOU'RE LYING
ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE.

36:03.429 --> 36:04.796
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.199
- THE GOVERNOR DIDN'T DIE
OF NATURAL CAUSES.

36:07.233 --> 36:11.437
HE WAS GIVEN DRUGS
THAT CAUSED A HEART ATTACK.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.372
- OH, MY GOD.

36:13.405 --> 36:16.208
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

36:16.242 --> 36:19.411
WE JUST WANTED TO PROTECT
HIS WIFE, HIS REPUTATION.

36:19.445 --> 36:20.912
IS THAT A CRIME?

36:20.946 --> 36:23.449
- NO, BUT COVERING UP
A MURDER IS.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.384
- I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS A MURDER.

36:25.417 --> 36:28.287
- YOU HAVE
TWO DAUGHTERS, RIGHT?

36:28.320 --> 36:31.423
IF YOU'RE CONVICTED
FOR FALSIFYING A CRIME SCENE,

36:31.457 --> 36:33.725
OBSTRUCTION,

36:33.759 --> 36:36.395
THEY WILL BE TEENAGERS
BEFORE YOU GET OUT.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.529
[knock on door, door opens]

36:37.563 --> 36:39.431
- DETECTIVES,

36:39.465 --> 36:41.800
OUR GOOD FRIEND MARVIN EXLEY
FOR THE DEFENSE.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.235
- I NEED YOU
TO STOP TALKING, IRIS.

36:43.269 --> 36:44.236
- IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

36:44.270 --> 36:46.472
YOU DO THAT, AND YOU WILL LOSE
YOUR LAST CHANCE

36:46.505 --> 36:47.339
TO HELP YOURSELF.

36:47.373 --> 36:48.807
- SWEETHEART,
THEY'RE LYING TO YOU.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.409
CAN I HAVE A MOMENT ALONE
WITH MY CLIENT?

36:50.442 --> 36:52.478
- SO WHO HIRED YOU, EXLEY, HMM--
DELIA WILSON?

36:52.511 --> 36:54.413
- THAT IS NONE
OF YOUR CONCERN, DETECTIVE.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.915
I AM HERE TO HELP IRIS.

36:56.948 --> 37:00.286
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

37:00.319 --> 37:02.788
IRIS, YOU'RE DONE HERE.

37:08.794 --> 37:12.298
- YOU ARE.
I'M NOT.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.164
- EXCUSE ME?

37:13.198 --> 37:16.802
- I AM NOT TAKING THE FALL
FOR THIS.

37:16.835 --> 37:20.238
I'LL TALK
TO THE DETECTIVES ALONE.

37:29.348 --> 37:32.418
[door closes]
- TELL US ABOUT DELIA.

37:34.986 --> 37:37.423
N.Y.P.D.
[siren wails]

37:37.456 --> 37:39.325
YOUR RUN'S OVER, DELIA.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.992
- YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
THE PARKWAY, DETECTIVES.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.428
YOU WOULD HAVE MADE
BETTER TIME.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.462
- DELIA WILSON,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

37:43.495 --> 37:45.897
FOR PROMOTING PROSTITUTION
IN THE THIRD DEGREE.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.468
- I MAKE FRESH GOAT CHEESE,
AND I HELP PEOPLE FIND LOVE.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.570
THERE'S NO CRIME
IN EITHER OF THOSE THINGS.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.372
- ONE OF GANZEL'S WHORES
GOT TO THE GOVERNOR

37:53.405 --> 37:54.873
AN HOUR BEFORE YUKO SHOWED.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.408
WHY DON'T YOU
BULLY THEM?

37:56.442 --> 37:57.543
- WELL, IF EITHER ONE OF YOU
HAVE ANY EVIDENCE,

37:57.576 --> 38:00.579
WE'D BE HAPPY
TO TAKE YOUR STATEMENT.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.417
- YOUR HONOR,
WE HAVE CORROBORATED

38:05.451 --> 38:06.585
LAW-ENFORCEMENT EVIDENCE

38:06.618 --> 38:09.355
THAT DELIA WILSON HAS BEEN
RUNNING A PROSTITUTION RING

38:09.388 --> 38:10.989
WITH IMPUNITY
FOR TEN YEARS.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.791
- PLEASE, YOUR HONOR,
THIS IS PURE SLANDER.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.025
MRS. WILSON
IS A SHADCHAN.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.495
THAT MEANS SHE RUNS
A MATCHMAKING SERVICE

38:16.528 --> 38:18.897
AS A KINDNESS--
SHE HAS A BIG HEART.

38:18.930 --> 38:22.501
- SHE'S ALSO A SUSPECT IN THE
MURDER OF A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

38:22.534 --> 38:25.036
- THEN WHY ISN'T SHE BEING
CHARGED WITH THAT CRIME?

38:25.070 --> 38:27.339
MY CLIENT
IS A MOTHER OF THREE.

38:27.373 --> 38:28.306
SHE'S A FARMER.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.476
SHE'S NOT A FLIGHT RISK.
SHE HAS NO ASSETS.

38:30.509 --> 38:31.877
- HER ASSETS
ARE HIDDEN OVERSEAS.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.379
WE'VE TRACED PAYMENTS

38:33.412 --> 38:35.614
TO ANGUILLAN CORPORATIONS
THAT MR. EXLEY HIMSELF

38:35.647 --> 38:37.048
HELPED SET UP FOR HER.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.385
AS SUCH, WE'LL BE MOVING
TO HAVE MR. EXLEY

38:39.418 --> 38:40.586
DISQUALIFIED AS COUNSEL.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.421
- THIS IS A WITCH HUNT,
YOUR HONOR.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.288
- THANK YOU, MR. EXLEY.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.391
BUT GIVEN THE WEIGHT
OF THESE CHARGES

38:45.424 --> 38:48.394
AND THE FLIGHT RISK,
BAIL IS SET AT $2 MILLION.

38:48.427 --> 38:50.529
[gavel bangs]

38:50.562 --> 38:53.331
[murmurs from the courtroom]

38:59.405 --> 39:01.440
- THANK YOU.

39:01.473 --> 39:04.876
WELL, DELIA WILSON
IS OUT ON BAIL.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.678
- HOW? I THOUGHT
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY ASSETS.

39:06.712 --> 39:09.948
- MR. EXLEY PUT UP
HIS OWN TOWNHOUSE.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.884
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT, I DID.
SHE'S A FRIEND.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.387
SO YOU PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET
THE BIG PICTURE, DO YOU?

39:15.421 --> 39:16.488
- WHICH IS WHAT?

39:16.522 --> 39:19.124
- WELL, SHE'S AVOIDED ARREST
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS.

39:19.157 --> 39:22.428
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT IS?

39:22.461 --> 39:24.430
SHE HAS THE GOODS
ON EVERYONE YOU WORK FOR,

39:24.463 --> 39:27.999
EVERYONE YOU WILL EVER CONSIDER
WORKING FOR.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.903
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW DEEP THIS GOES.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.440
- WE'LL DO OUR JOB.
YOU DO YOURS.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.008
- RIGHT, AND YOU
AND YOUR D.A. FRIEND HADEN--

39:37.042 --> 39:39.578
YOU'RE IN THIS
WAY OVER YOUR HEAD, SWEETHEART.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.447
I GET PAID TOP DOLLAR
FOR MY LEGAL ADVICE.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.483
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU
FOR FREE.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.017
WALK AWAY,
LITTLE PEOPLE.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.587
- NOW WATCH YOURSELF,
COUNSELOR.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.688
- YEAH.

39:49.721 --> 39:54.025
AND YOU--YOU THINK YOUR MARRIAGE
IS ROCKY NOW, KIDDO?

39:54.059 --> 39:56.161
JUST WAIT TILL YOUR WIFE FINDS
OUT ABOUT YOU

39:56.194 --> 39:57.596
AND YOUR STAR WITNESS.

40:03.502 --> 40:06.472
- HE'S PLAYING
SOME PRETTY SERIOUS HARDBALL.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.707
IS THERE ANYTHING
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

40:08.740 --> 40:10.942
- NOTHING, CAPTAIN.

40:10.976 --> 40:13.044
WE'RE GOOD.

40:23.522 --> 40:26.024
- DETECTIVE AMARO...

40:26.057 --> 40:30.629
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

40:30.662 --> 40:33.031
- YEAH. OF COURSE.

40:33.064 --> 40:36.735
LOOK, LET'S COME INSIDE.
COME ON.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.638
WHAT'S GOING ON, CARISSA?

40:42.541 --> 40:44.510
- IF I TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S DEATH,

40:44.543 --> 40:46.144
CAN YOU PROTECT ME?

40:48.647 --> 40:50.549
- WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME?

40:53.018 --> 40:54.953
WERE YOU THERE?

40:59.224 --> 41:00.626
- YOU ALREADY KNOW
THERE'S A WAR GOING ON

41:00.659 --> 41:03.194
BETWEEN GANZEL AND DELIA.

41:03.228 --> 41:05.631
MAGGIE GOT CAUGHT,
THE GOVERNOR...

41:05.664 --> 41:06.965
I THINK I'M NEXT.

41:11.136 --> 41:14.540
- OKAY.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.775
LOOK, WE CAN PROTECT YOU.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.210
COME INSIDE WITH ME RIGHT NOW.
I'LL TAKE YOUR STATEMENT.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.747
- UH...

41:21.780 --> 41:23.081
I THINK I SHOULD GO.

41:23.114 --> 41:25.517
UM, THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

41:25.551 --> 41:27.285
- HEY, CARISSA...

41:27.318 --> 41:31.523
JUST TAKE MY CARD...

41:31.557 --> 41:32.724
AT LEAST.

41:37.796 --> 41:41.767
JUST CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ME...

42:31.282 --> 42:34.319
[breathing heavily]
