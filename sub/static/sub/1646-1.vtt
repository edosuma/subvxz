Let's make sure we got
what we wanted.

- Linc.
- Yeah.

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.162

B and E, and we're out of here.

That's a good question.

it is a monster of a code.

...about what happened in Panama...

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:23.838
...but I think I already know
what you're gonna say.

01:21:23.963 --> 01:21:25.006
How's that?

01:21:25.423 --> 01:21:27.550
Because you're a little like me.

01:21:28.301 --> 01:21:31.554
Because you're gonna say you're fine,
that you can handle it.

01:21:33.347 --> 01:21:35.016
Um...

01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:36.976

I'm here.

Whenever you wanna talk...

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:43.983
...I'm here.

01:21:45.026 --> 01:21:46.360
Thank you.

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:53.993
You know that the only thing...

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:57.914
...that kept me alive when I was being
held was the thought of being with you.

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:03.252
Also if anything happened to me,
you were gonna blame yourself...

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:07.090
...and you would spend the rest of
your life punishing yourself for it.

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:10.051
And I can't bear the thought of that.

01:22:14.347 --> 01:22:17.308
So can we make a deal right now
that we're even...

01:22:17.475 --> 01:22:23.356
...and just wipe the slate clean,
and no guilt and no responsibility?

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:27.735
If we're gonna be together, I don't want
it to be out of a sense of obligation.

01:22:27.902 --> 01:22:33.533
Or even that we should be
because of what we've been through.

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:36.369
I just wanna start over.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:39.288

I have to divorce my wife?

01:22:48.339 --> 01:22:50.758
Because you're still married
to a Russian stripper.

I don't understand.
You said we copied the card.

01:23:04.564 --> 01:23:07.108
Well, we did,
but according to the encryption code...

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:11.821
Okay, how do I make this clear?
If Scylla was like a pizza...

01:23:11.988 --> 01:23:13.447
...all we got's a slice.

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:17.952
- So where's the rest of the data?
- I don't know. I don't know. I mean...

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:21.664
I don't know how we didn't
see this coming. It makes perfect sense.

01:23:21.831 --> 01:23:25.501
It's like nuclear launch codes. You don't
give all information to one person.

01:23:25.668 --> 01:23:28.921
- How many do you give it to?
- Okay, that quote your father held onto.

01:23:29.297 --> 01:23:31.048
Scylla is a six-headed monster...

01:23:31.174 --> 01:23:34.218
...that requires a sacrifice of six soldiers
in order to pass.

01:23:35.136 --> 01:23:36.929
So Scylla isn't one card.

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:40.266
It's six.

How are we gonna find five more?

- Yeah, I'm fine.

is to find those five other cards.
