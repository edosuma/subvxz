Oh, that's another
great bumper sticker.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.300
Walden, you're a great guy,

20:02.302 --> 20:05.002
But we lead
two very different lives.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.904
Did I mention
that I have a plane

20:06.906 --> 20:09.106
And I can take you anywhere
you want to go?

20:09.108 --> 20:13.044
Do you see?
You want to fly over everything.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.279
For you, it's all about
the destination.

20:15.281 --> 20:18.015
For me, the journey
is the destination.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.551
Okay, are you writing
these down?

20:22.754 --> 20:24.822
Go home, walden.

20:27.359 --> 20:29.627
(stammering)

20:29.629 --> 20:31.262
But I-I walked
four miles to get here

20:31.264 --> 20:33.631
In the dark.
In the woods!

20:33.633 --> 20:36.767
I don't even know
if I can find my way home.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.403
Maybe I should just stay
with you.

20:43.508 --> 20:45.009
(alarm chirps)

20:45.011 --> 20:46.377
Ah, dude, there's your car.

Here you go, sweetie.

20:53.987 --> 20:55.186
Thank you.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.659
I'm so sorry
I freaked out on you.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.261
It's not your fault.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.429
I should've known better.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.064
Vivian:
I'm sorry, too.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.933
I should have never let you go.

21:10.802 --> 21:12.603
Well, you're both here now...

21:12.605 --> 21:14.972
And I'm ready to enjoy the view.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.408
You want us to kiss, walden?

21:17.410 --> 21:20.278
Yeah, kiss each other.

21:23.749 --> 21:24.782

21:24.784 --> 21:26.517

Well, it is his house.
