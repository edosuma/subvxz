the tongue in the refrigerator.

and 75 cents.

                     you get it?

Here, read this.                

03:35.849 --> 03:39.784
"Keep in tune                   
with Sweetheart Prunes."        

03:41.687 --> 03:44.622
        I sent a coupon         
      to the prune company      

03:44.624 --> 03:46.390
    from the box top,           

03:46.392 --> 03:48.592

to send me a free quarter,

         and they did.          

03:49.996 --> 03:52.596
    And the next day,           
 they sent me another quarter,  

03:52.598 --> 03:57.468
     and then the next day      
 it started coming in bunches.  

03:57.470 --> 04:00.371
     And it's still coming.     

04:00.373 --> 04:02.440
                      You know  
                what that is?   

04:02.442 --> 04:04.175
                 It's a computer
                     foul-up.   

04:04.177 --> 04:06.610
Yeah, Ma, it's the company's    
fault, not yours.               

04:06.612 --> 04:10.915
Well, I know, Gloria,           
but it ain't right to keep them.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.322
     Why don't you just         
  send the quarters back?       

04:17.324 --> 04:18.957
             I tried that, Mike,

04:18.959 --> 04:23.361
  and every quarter I sent back,
    they sent me two more.      

04:24.563 --> 04:26.597
    They probably just read     
      the computer wrong.

     Well, they never stop.     

04:29.169 --> 04:32.103

    some Sweetheart Prunes.

     Well, I'm gonna tell Archie
          about it tonight.

    don't tell Archie!

04:42.115 --> 04:44.382
    Ma, if you tell Archie,     
  he's gonna want to spend it.  

04:44.384 --> 04:45.984
          And he's got          
     no right to spend it.      

04:45.986 --> 04:50.621

         notice nothing

                last night?

         I found her laying over
         on my side of the bed. 

05:26.359 --> 05:28.859
 She's never done that before.  
     I couldn't believe it.     

05:28.861 --> 05:32.363
     I jumped in, I thought     
I landed on a beach ball.

             the quarters here. 

06:26.552 --> 06:29.753
             Edith! Oh, my God. 

06:29.755 --> 06:32.123
         How much money is that?

06:32.125 --> 06:35.159
Forty-seven dollars             
and 75 cents.                   

06:35.161 --> 06:39.864
All I done was send in a coupon 
to the prune company.           

06:39.866 --> 06:43.901
              You sent <i>a</i> coupon 
             to a prune company?

06:43.903 --> 06:47.571
Yeah. And they were supposed    
to send me one quarter.         

06:47.573 --> 06:50.908
And they did. But then they     
started coming every day.       

06:50.910 --> 06:54.778
Sometimes four and five,        
and I can't stop it.            

06:54.780 --> 06:58.749
                  Why would you 
                  wanna stop it?

06:58.751 --> 07:01.185
                [MUTTERS]       

07:03.422 --> 07:05.390
                Oh, Edith,      

07:05.392 --> 07:08.692
     I think you found the goose
     that laid the golden prune.

07:08.694 --> 07:11.496
            Oh, Edith,          
I'll tell you what we'll do.    

07:11.498 --> 07:14.432
    After supper we'll decide   
        how we'll spend it, eh? 

07:14.434 --> 07:16.734
Archie, we can't                
spend this money.               

07:16.736 --> 07:19.404
It ain't ours.                  
It didn't come to me honest.    

07:19.406 --> 07:21.906
      Edith, don't tell me that.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.908
      I don't wanna hear nothing
         about how you got it.  

07:23.910 --> 07:25.910
     I don't wanna hear nothing 
         I gotta deny later.    

07:25.912 --> 07:28.146
  You know, you sound just like 
     Haldeman and Ehrlichman.   

07:28.148 --> 07:32.983
    And you sound like that     
  Heeb congressman Sam Erving.  

07:32.985 --> 07:33.918
            Come on.            

07:35.087 --> 07:36.720
              Don't pay         
        no attention to them.   

07:36.722 --> 07:38.156
        What are you            
         gonna do?              

07:38.158 --> 07:40.958
    The first thing I want you  
  to know is I ain't mad at you.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.061
            Will youse two      
            get away from here? 

07:43.063 --> 07:44.162
                 Come over here.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.963
                Now, all I wanna
                  know is this. 

07:45.965 --> 07:48.166
            You say the quarters
            are still coming in?

07:48.168 --> 07:52.002
Oh, yeah, they're               
up to $8 a week now.            

07:52.004 --> 07:53.704
        Eight dollars a week?   

07:53.706 --> 07:56.274
             Edith, let me see, 
            that is $400 a year.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.209
          That's-- In 10 years, 
            that's over $4000.  

07:58.211 --> 07:59.444
                  That ain't    
              counting interest.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.145
        No, no, no, no,         
      forget about the interest.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.413
            We can't get that   

08:02.415 --> 08:04.014
        because that would come 
          from a savings bank,  

08:04.016 --> 08:05.349
            see, and there would
                 be records,    

08:05.351 --> 08:07.151
        we'd get mixed up with  
     the Infernal Revenue there.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.186
Archie--                        

08:08.188 --> 08:10.154
            Edith, Edith, Edith.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.090
            I know-- I know     
              what we gotta do. 

08:12.092 --> 08:14.024
     We gotta do the right thing
            with this money.    

08:14.026 --> 08:15.025
Good, Archie.                   

08:15.027 --> 08:17.761
              We gotta spend it.

08:17.763 --> 08:19.063
Oh, no, Archie.                 

08:19.065 --> 08:21.932
We can't spend it.              
That money ain't ours.          

08:21.934 --> 08:24.935
  Edith, Edith, don't say that. 
      Don't even think that.    

08:24.937 --> 08:26.937
     Now just turn right around,
    go back in the kitchen,     

08:26.939 --> 08:28.339
                 and get dinner 
              on the table, huh?

08:28.341 --> 08:32.210
Daddy, you got to send that     
money back to the prune company!

08:32.212 --> 08:35.413
  Shut up, you. Go and help your
 mother get dinner on the table.

08:35.414 --> 08:36.414
          But, Daddy!           

08:36.416 --> 08:38.482
Gloria, we'll get               
dinner on now.                  

08:38.485 --> 08:40.217
    You're cheating             
     that company, Arch.        

08:40.220 --> 08:41.419
    You're cheating             
     that company!              

08:41.421 --> 08:42.453
                    Oh, come on.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.554
                 Don't you think
                  big companies 

08:43.556 --> 08:45.189
            are always cheating 
          little people like us?

08:45.191 --> 08:47.091
     What about that big company
              last year         

08:47.093 --> 08:49.127
  offering a free trip to Hawaii
          and two free cars     

08:49.129 --> 08:50.194
 and never delivered on nothing?

08:50.196 --> 08:51.295
              You remember that.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.430
Yeah, I remember that.          

08:52.432 --> 08:53.931
I told you about it.            
                        Well?   

08:53.933 --> 08:55.933
You said, "So what?             
That's the American way."       

08:55.935 --> 08:57.835
                  Well, it is   
            the American way.   

08:57.837 --> 08:59.870
            And this is         
         the other American way:

08:59.872 --> 09:01.872
                getting even    
        on that American way.   

09:01.874 --> 09:03.374
All right.                      

09:03.376 --> 09:05.476
Go ahead, go ahead,             
cheat the companies,            

09:05.478 --> 09:06.844
let the companies cheat you.    

09:06.846 --> 09:08.879
Meanwhile, there's no more      
human contact left.             

09:08.881 --> 09:11.115
The whole country's             
being ruled by machines.        

09:11.117 --> 09:12.683
            Ah, get out of here,
                  will you?     

09:12.685 --> 09:14.519
You're always singing the blues 
    about the country.          

09:14.521 --> 09:16.220
      Let me tell you something.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.888
              This country ain't
              ruled by machines,

09:17.890 --> 09:19.923
        this country is ruled   
             by our president.  

09:19.925 --> 09:23.561
There you go, Arch,             
proving my point again.         

09:23.563 --> 09:25.129
              Ah, there he goes,

09:25.131 --> 09:28.699
          taking another rap at 
          poor Richard E. Nixon.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.134
                  Listen, buddy,

09:30.136 --> 09:33.504
that ain't rapping Mr. Nixon,   
    calling him a machine.      

09:33.506 --> 09:34.738
            That's a compliment.
                You know why?   

09:34.740 --> 09:35.939
                Because machines
                    are great.  

09:35.941 --> 09:37.508
        And American machines   
             are the greatest.  

09:37.510 --> 09:39.310
     American machines are what 
keeps this country number one   

09:39.312 --> 09:40.978
            and ahead of        
          the rest of the world.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.680
        What, do you wanna be   
              like the Chinks,  

09:42.682 --> 09:44.782
    counting up things on beads?

09:44.784 --> 09:46.684
Don't you see                   
what computers are doing?       

09:46.686 --> 09:48.219
They're making everything       
depersonalized.                 

09:48.221 --> 09:50.321
I mean, if something goes wrong,
you got a complaint,            

09:50.323 --> 09:52.657
wouldn't you rather talk        
to a human being face to face?  

09:52.659 --> 09:56.927
            Sure I would,       
        but all I got is you.   

09:56.929 --> 09:58.329
        Dinner.                 

09:58.331 --> 09:59.330
        [DOORBELL RINGS]        

09:59.332 --> 10:00.364
    I'll get it.                

10:00.366 --> 10:01.999
              Well, I was trying
            to make a point,    

10:02.001 --> 10:04.468
         but I guess the one    
     on your head beat me to it.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.437
            Will you get        
        away from me?           

10:06.439 --> 10:08.839
  Arch, don't you see? If things
keep going the way they are,    

10:08.841 --> 10:11.075
pretty soon computers will be   
  doing all our thinking for us.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.943
If computers can do it          
better than us,                 

10:12.945 --> 10:14.445
then what's the difference?     

10:14.447 --> 10:16.880
 None to you, Arch, because you 
haven't been thinking for years.

10:16.882 --> 10:19.617
Listen, buddy, I work for       
a living, I don't have to think.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.819
            That makes sense.   
     Ah!                        

10:21.821 --> 10:25.055
  Archie, here's a letter from  
 the Veterans' Administration,  

10:25.057 --> 10:26.490
        special delivery.       

10:26.492 --> 10:27.958
    Well, give me it.           

10:27.960 --> 10:30.060
No. It's addressed to me.       

10:30.062 --> 10:31.862
        Why would the VA        
    be writing to you?          

10:31.864 --> 10:32.996
      You ain't a veteran.      

10:32.998 --> 10:35.700
 I got a death benefit coming.  

10:40.839 --> 10:42.106
        You got a what?         

10:42.108 --> 10:44.508
        A death benefit.        

10:44.510 --> 10:45.643
        A death--?              

10:45.645 --> 10:47.245
    Edith, that means           
    you're collecting           

10:47.247 --> 10:48.579
on some kind of insurance.      

10:48.581 --> 10:51.616
Edith, this is                  
a red-letter day for us.        

10:51.618 --> 10:52.617
Look at this.                   

10:52.619 --> 10:53.618
Forty-seven dollars             
worth of quarters               

10:53.620 --> 10:56.019
and now somebody died.          

10:57.522 --> 10:58.623
Who died?                       

11:00.259 --> 11:01.992
                     You did.   

11:11.903 --> 11:13.971
         Yes, operator,         
    I'm still holding.          

11:13.973 --> 11:16.173
Here's your toast, Gloria.      

11:16.175 --> 11:17.375
Thanks, Ma.                     

11:17.377 --> 11:18.776
You're looking kind of tired,   
you know.                       

11:18.778 --> 11:20.645
Didn't you sleep well           
last night?                     

11:20.647 --> 11:21.945
         Not too good.          

11:21.947 --> 11:25.916
    I had an awful nightmare    
about Archie really being dead, 

11:25.918 --> 11:28.653
     and he got mad at me.      

11:29.721 --> 11:30.854
         In the dream?          

11:30.856 --> 11:32.723
     No, when I woke him up     

11:32.725 --> 11:36.226
to make sure he was alive.      

11:36.228 --> 11:39.229
     Hey, Ma, I got through to  
the prune company in Buffalo.   

11:39.231 --> 11:40.598
                    Hello?      

11:40.600 --> 11:42.667
          Is this Mr. Henderson?

11:42.669 --> 11:44.101
                 Yeah. Uh, good.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.404
              I'm calling you   
        for my mother-in-law,   

11:46.406 --> 11:47.605
             Mrs. Archie Bunker.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.740
     She sent you a letter      
    about a week ago.           

11:49.742 --> 11:52.910
Right. Right, about the $47.75. 

11:52.912 --> 11:55.279
    Well, she's sending you     
     a money order by mail.     

11:55.281 --> 11:56.280
             And--              

11:56.282 --> 11:57.415
             Hello?

        I brought my sample book
                 with me.       

18:02.014 --> 18:06.684
    Now, this here is a picture 
of our model "Peace With Honor."

18:06.686 --> 18:08.418
                 Now, ain't that
                 something, huh?

18:08.420 --> 18:12.222
No, I think I like the chocolate
     box number over here.      

18:12.224 --> 18:13.991
         What are you           
         doing here?            

18:13.993 --> 18:15.392
                 I'm just trying
                 to make a buck.

18:15.394 --> 18:16.794
             Your name turned up
                 on my list.    

18:16.796 --> 18:18.162
Yeah, that's just like you,     
Whitehead,                      

18:18.164 --> 18:20.363
trying to get me into the ground
while I'm still twitching.      

18:20.365 --> 18:21.598
                 Come on, Edith!

18:21.600 --> 18:22.966
    Archie, look,               
     it ain't my fault.         

18:22.968 --> 18:25.069
            Oh, whoa, whoa,     
            it ain't your fault.

18:25.071 --> 18:28.772
Here, get your coat and let's go
before this guy embalms me.     

18:28.774 --> 18:30.607
         Archie, can I          
        give you a lift?        

18:30.609 --> 18:32.542
            Get away from me!   

18:35.180 --> 18:37.014
Sorry to keep you folks waiting,

18:37.016 --> 18:39.549
             but I finally found
                your file.      

18:39.551 --> 18:41.118
                    Don't worry,
                    Mrs. Bunker,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.353
              we here at the    
        Veterans' Administration

18:43.355 --> 18:46.323
    understand these problems   
            very well.          

18:46.325 --> 18:47.557
                            Now,

18:47.559 --> 18:50.594
        the first thing         
      I need to know is...      

18:50.596 --> 18:53.030
         where is your          
        husband buried?         

18:56.101 --> 18:57.968
Her husband                     
ain't buried.                   

18:57.970 --> 19:02.372
        Well, we'll certainly   
             take care of that. 

19:03.541 --> 19:04.842
            Where's the body?   

19:04.844 --> 19:08.045
Hey, Mac, I'm the body.         
I'm her husband.                

19:08.047 --> 19:09.713
            Oh, no.             

19:09.715 --> 19:11.849
What do you mean, no?           

19:11.851 --> 19:13.951
Am I your husband?              
                    Oh, yeah.   

19:13.953 --> 19:15.652
I'm her husband.                
I'm her husband.                

19:15.654 --> 19:16.920
I'm alive,                      
believe me.                     

19:16.922 --> 19:18.688
                Mr. Bunker,     
         I believe you're alive.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.224
              You believe it,   
          your wife believes it,

19:20.226 --> 19:23.426
     but now we've got to get   
 the computer to believe it too.

19:24.829 --> 19:26.764
            Oh, uh, Dundee here.

19:26.766 --> 19:32.302
    Can you get me a quick check
            on 2-357-58?        

19:32.304 --> 19:33.771
                      Thank you.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.005
              Oh.               

19:35.007 --> 19:38.441
         You don't know         
     what we're up against.     

19:38.443 --> 19:42.880
 We have to wipe out this tape  
    and reprogram it.           

19:42.882 --> 19:45.983
        You've given us         
    a lot of overtime here.     

19:45.985 --> 19:47.885
Well, don't blame me, Mac.      

19:47.887 --> 19:52.156
I mean, I didn't commit suicide.
  Your computer bumped me off.  

19:54.592 --> 19:58.328
    Well, let me show you       
just how complicated this is.   

19:58.330 --> 20:01.498
        This is your card       
        from our deceased file. 

20:01.500 --> 20:04.168
Oh, I hate that.                

20:04.170 --> 20:09.773
 And each of these little holes 
has a meaning all its own.

         Archie Bunker.

    A bunch of holes?

 That's what it comes down to.  

20:22.354 --> 20:24.721

    little hole here?

Yeah?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.803
        Uh, Dundee. Yes?        

20:39.805 --> 20:41.205

      One number out of place.

 Mr. Bunker, you're the victim  
      of a slipped digit.       

20:54.252 --> 20:55.886
    You're not dead at all.     

20:55.888 --> 20:58.288
          Well, there.          
 I'm off the death list anyway. 

20:58.290 --> 20:59.756
          No, not yet.          

20:59.758 --> 21:03.193
 Not until you receive official 
confirmation in the mail.

 Ohh.                           

21:04.196 --> 21:06.063
          Well, ain't this nice?

21:06.065 --> 21:08.131
        It means nobody died.   

21:08.133 --> 21:11.235
          Well, a man           
named Archie Binker died.       

21:11.237 --> 21:13.436
             Oh, that's too bad.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.972
What do you mean,               
too bad?                        

21:14.974 --> 21:16.706
You want me to be dead?         

21:16.708 --> 21:20.744
        No, Archie, I don't want
            nobody to be dead.  

21:20.746 --> 21:25.515
Edith, somebody's gotta be dead.
That's life.                    

21:27.185 --> 21:28.785
    What do we have here?       

21:28.787 --> 21:30.220
         Nothing from the VA,   

21:30.222 --> 21:32.622
    and that creep Dundee       
    told me three days ago      

21:32.624 --> 21:35.192
            he's gonna fill     
                  my hole in.   

21:39.530 --> 21:40.998
Is there anything               
for me?                         

21:41.000 --> 21:42.565
 No, nothing for you, Meathead. 

21:42.567 --> 21:44.768
  Just for your mother-in-law.  
        Sympathy cards.

      you're still alive.

Uh, excuse me, please.

It's a man from the Welcome Mat 
real estate company.            

22:06.292 --> 22:07.590
              What does he want?

22:07.592 --> 22:10.693
He wants to know                
if I wanna sell the house.      

22:10.695 --> 22:13.530
He says lots of widows          
sell their houses.

 somebody to tell me I'm alive,

    in the ground somewheres
