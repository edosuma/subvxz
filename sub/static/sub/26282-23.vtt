00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.602 --> 00:04.605
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs...

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.064
- Previously on The Resident...
- A few weeks ago,

00:20.088 --> 00:22.590
a wonderful man who loved me
proposed.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.493
I took so long to decide
that he changed his mind.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.604
- Wait, is this for us?
- Yes, of course it's for us.

00:27.628 --> 00:31.065
- We can get a hot tub. Raise chickens.
- What?

00:31.099 --> 00:33.434
I don't move in with you,
so you just leave me.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.045
If you're not interested
in going forward, for me,

00:35.069 --> 00:36.704
it's time to take a step back.

00:36.737 --> 00:37.847
So my kidneys will
never work again?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.240
You have to stay on dialysis

00:39.273 --> 00:41.409
- for the rest of your life, Jess.
- Come on.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.010
There's got to be
another option.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.945
It's not that you can't
give Jessie your kidney,

00:44.978 --> 00:46.214
it's that you won't!

00:46.247 --> 00:48.682
Why can't you for once,
for once,

00:48.716 --> 00:50.050
do something that
is not selfish?

01:05.099 --> 01:07.468
That's exactly my point!

01:30.358 --> 01:32.460
- Hey, this is Kyle.
- You know what to do.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.852
What's wrong?

02:31.885 --> 02:34.154
Everything okay?

02:34.188 --> 02:36.190
Can I come in?

02:43.831 --> 02:47.301
Look...

02:47.335 --> 02:49.570
I've been thinking a lot
about us.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.804
And I realized something,

02:50.838 --> 02:53.974
so just hear me out.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.043
Of course.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.146
Life is hard.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.549
And the problems keep coming.

03:01.582 --> 03:05.018
And I keep... trying
to solve them all by myself.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.721
Jessie, my dad, our patients.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.224
I seem...

03:10.258 --> 03:14.228
completely incapable
of asking for help.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.230
I don't know why I do that.

03:16.264 --> 03:19.333
Well, you lost your mom

03:19.367 --> 03:20.868
- as a kid.
- No, no, I don't...

03:20.901 --> 03:22.035
I don't want to do that.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.036
I don't want to make excuses.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.738
I want to see the pattern,

03:24.772 --> 03:27.841
take responsibility, and change.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.446
Okay, I'm listening.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.016
You said you want
to move forward

03:36.049 --> 03:37.618
in our relationship.

03:37.651 --> 03:40.621
I want that, too.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.924
I just need you
to meet me halfway.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.527
- What do you mean?
- It means...

03:46.560 --> 03:49.229
I want to start talking
about moving in,

03:49.263 --> 03:52.633
marriage, a family, all of it.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.635
But you can't push me.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.236
You can't rush me.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.840
Let me do this at my own pace.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.711
Okay. Yeah.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.513
I can do that.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.918
This is a big deal.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.856
Yeah.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.330
I'm in.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.405
I just...

04:31.439 --> 04:33.941
I just only have one request.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.943
What?

04:35.976 --> 04:39.146
I really want those chickens.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.183
No chickens.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.259
Your company,
Red Rock Mountain Medical,

04:52.292 --> 04:55.095
is the top health care
conglomerate in the Southeast.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.964
Your motto? "We're like family."

04:56.997 --> 05:01.168
But your family is missing
a crucial piece.

05:01.201 --> 05:05.138
We now own every major hospital
within a hundred-mile radius.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.174
We don't need Chastain.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.275
But you do.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.277
To control pricing.
