00:54.240 --> 00:59.944
I want to sin!
I burn  in the flames of fornication!

01:06.720 --> 01:08.569
I want to be consumed by you.

01:19.540 --> 01:20.865
Arnica?

01:21.460 --> 01:24.663
I´m Erszebet. You are Arnica.

01:25.140 --> 01:27.483
In don´t want to die in flames like you.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.167
If you die now, you stay young forever.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.352
As shouldn´t travel alone.  Its not safe,

01:46.353 --> 01:48.119
especially during the war.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.810
I have all the protection I need.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.444
I represent the  interests of the king.

01:54.020 --> 01:56.829
I hope you don´t want to assault me.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.362
You are lucky,
I haven´t the strength for it.

02:02.320 --> 02:06.086
Rumours about your healer
have reached the Viennese court.

02:06.140 --> 02:08.576
She´s hurting your reputation.
Get rid of her!

02:08.577 --> 02:10.477
Darvulia in not your concern!

02:10.478 --> 02:13.444
Erzsebet, you should think about
the future of Pal.

02:13.911 --> 02:17.382
If we both join forces with the  Habsburgs,
they will win the war,

02:18.383 --> 02:21.167
and we become fabulously wealthy.

02:23.360 --> 02:28.752
The Bathory family will never, never
convert to Catholicism.

02:28.780 --> 02:32.387
I am a Protestant, as well as you.
But think about it.

02:32.540 --> 02:37.953
If we come together to achieve peace
between the Habsburgs
and the Hungarian nobility,

02:38.640 --> 02:41.145
your son could become emperor.

02:41.146 --> 02:46.983
- Is that the interest of the King?
-This is my wish.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.340
I want you.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.790
What are you doing?

02:57.540 --> 03:00.545
-Ferenc would have killed you.
Ferenc is dead.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.736
Then I will kill you!

03:21.380 --> 03:23.591
I´m sorry, my lady.
My hand slipped.

03:31.340 --> 03:33.230
You wanted to kill me!

03:36.220 --> 03:38.622
No, I would give my life for you.

03:39.780 --> 03:44.877
I know, Sara.  I know ...

04:31.300 --> 04:33.904
I can not tell dream from reality.

04:34.380 --> 04:35.999
I´m tired. I want to die.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.623
You can not leave  this world, dear.

04:42.020 --> 04:43.751
Your children need you.

04:46.860 --> 04:48.862
Especially little Pal.

04:49.980 --> 04:54.805
-Pal?  Yes, your son.

04:56.820 --> 04:58.384
I don´t have a son.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.710
I don´t understand.

05:12.700 --> 05:16.921
The medicine that helped you,
is now working against you.

05:29.540 --> 05:34.182
Holy God.
Again.  Did you notice the code of arms?

05:34.380 --> 05:36.428
Three dragon´s teeth.

05:36.580 --> 05:40.301
They say she has full barrels of blood
of virgins in the cellar.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.789
Sooner or later, it will be
the blood of all of us.

06:03.740 --> 06:05.999
For, if you are not to be saved
by good words.

06:06.420 --> 06:10.928
It is a sure and certain thing
that you will be damned by evil ones.

06:11.460 --> 06:14.271
The Jezebel is still among us!

06:14.780 --> 06:17.151
Hidden in the walls of her castle,

06:17.380 --> 06:21.372
bathing in the blood
of innocent virgins.

06:24.660 --> 06:29.146
Leave!  The truth will follow you!

06:30.460 --> 06:32.481
Look!  A miracle!

06:33.860 --> 06:37.878
God confirmed my words!

06:41.740 --> 06:43.451
The mail arrived.

06:47.220 --> 06:49.382
-Easy!  -Thank you, mother.

06:50.558 --> 06:52.343
You help me in the kitchen.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.799
Margita, hurry!

07:06.940 --> 07:08.726
-Margita ...
-I need you in the kitchen.

07:12.180 --> 07:14.223
Cyril, what was it this time?

07:16.480 --> 07:20.139
Cardinal Forgach wants proof
that Ponicky is right.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.909
We have to sneak into the castle.

07:23.340 --> 07:29.068
Don´t you think its strange?
She look about 20 years younger than she is.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.763
Father Peter, you must really hate her?

07:44.717 --> 07:46.777
Why did Sarah came in to comb my hair?

07:47.382 --> 07:52.124
Don´t you remember? Really?

07:56.100 --> 08:00.583
-What is it that you drinking all the time?
-Your potion.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.220
God!

08:04.760 --> 08:06.225
Mushrooms.

08:09.740 --> 08:14.029
Don´t eat or drink anything that
I haven´t prepared for you.

08:14.140 --> 08:15.790
You understand?

08:16.540 --> 08:18.224
Take this one!

08:21.226 --> 08:23.703
No, I don´t want any more
eat raw liver.

08:23.707 --> 08:26.803
You have to  purify your blood.

08:27.220 --> 08:30.389
Blood!  Blood!

08:33.919 --> 08:38.820
I want Sara!  Where is Sara?

08:39.480 --> 08:41.220
Sara is dead.

08:44.820 --> 08:47.027
-You killed Sara?
-I can help you.

08:47.140 --> 08:49.620
-You killed Sara!
-I can help you.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.509
Somebody wants to poison your soul.

08:51.660 --> 08:52.786
No!

08:53.100 --> 08:56.741
Look what these  mushrooms
have caused you.

08:57.460 --> 09:00.304
-A murderer.  -No.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.705
I didn´t...

09:07.100 --> 09:08.382
I didn´t killed her.

09:09.483 --> 09:13.880
You ...
You!  Deceived me all these years!

09:14.420 --> 09:15.706
Ficzko!

09:16.300 --> 09:19.998
-Ficzko!
Ficzko!  Yes, my lady?

09:20.420 --> 09:25.347
Take that witch.
Chain her to the wall!

09:26.801 --> 09:28.491
I´m not your enemy.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.237
I would never hurt you!

09:46.460 --> 09:48.543
Take your poison with you.

09:50.030 --> 09:52.984
May God forgive you, Erzsebet!

10:06.140 --> 10:08.507
Fast, Father!  Fast!

10:25.260 --> 10:27.786
We are right on time!

10:31.500 --> 10:34.265
-We should have used disguise.  -Remember ...

10:34.420 --> 10:38.664
A guest entering a house,
is God entering

10:38.860 --> 10:40.466
even if he´s a catholic.

10:41.620 --> 10:44.227
Then, why not enter  the front door?

10:54.460 --> 10:56.383
Move!  Move!

10:58.940 --> 11:01.202
Lucia, wait for me!

11:07.410 --> 11:08.626
timo!  timo!

11:19.100 --> 11:20.670
Come, Cyril!

11:20.760 --> 11:22.100
Witch!

11:23.100 --> 11:25.580
We´ve got to find those barrels with blood.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.810
Father Peter!

11:30.620 --> 11:32.588
Pastor Ponicky was right.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.824
Prepare the device.

11:36.980 --> 11:39.028
We capture the moment!

11:43.820 --> 11:47.188
A beautiful proof!  Cyril!

12:00.660 --> 12:04.421
-Spy!  - We were just looking ...

12:06.040 --> 12:07.410
What are you?

12:08.460 --> 12:12.626
-Spies? Thieves?  -We lenserers.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.910
We´re mapping the mountains
of Upper Hungary.

12:16.260 --> 12:19.503
You´re trespassing on my land.
That is what you´re doing.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.583
I will have your eyes put out.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.580
We are under the protection
of Cardinal Forgach.

12:28.780 --> 12:30.999
Not even the Pope
can protect you here.

12:47.620 --> 12:48.860
Cyril?

12:50.060 --> 12:53.906
The boy I healed!
You were attacked by wolves!

12:54.620 --> 12:56.006
Yes, its me.

12:56.950 --> 13:00.614
You patched me and  sent me to school.

13:02.100 --> 13:04.547
Thank you, my lady,
I will pray for you.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.845
But you became a catholic.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.990
Why did you renounce
the faith of your forefathers?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.662
I always wanted to be a lenserer.

13:13.820 --> 13:16.642
Mommy, mommy!
They found Sara

13:17.300 --> 13:18.506
Sara ...

13:18.660 --> 13:22.042
-What have they done to her?
-She was buried in church yard.

13:22.300 --> 13:25.483
Some dug her up.
-How did her body get here?

13:25.540 --> 13:29.181
I was on guard all night,  my lady.
Nothing passed me by.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.787
Poor girl!
A vampire  attacked and
sucked her blood.

13:32.940 --> 13:34.903
Now your soul never finds peace.

13:36.260 --> 13:40.004
This was not a vampire.
They are trying to trick us.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.543
Look at the bathtub.

14:03.220 --> 14:05.107
Bring Darvulia here.

14:10.994 --> 14:13.629
-Where is she?
-She´s gone.

14:14.140 --> 14:15.665
Thank God!

14:15.820 --> 14:20.155
Somebody helped.  The chain was cut.

14:20.540 --> 14:23.610
Throw these two spies
out of the castle now.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.503
-We are all Christians!  -Leave me alone.
..

14:28.620 --> 14:29.924
Leave me alone.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.941
Leave me alone.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.642
Leave me alone.

14:43.860 --> 14:47.425
Thank you!  Thank you!

14:47.540 --> 14:52.785
Thank God!
Saving us from the clutches
of the beast!

14:53.180 --> 14:57.305
One exhumed maid doesn´t make her a murderer
or a vampire, Peter.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.871
What about the blood in the bathtub?

15:03.620 --> 15:07.067
Only red herbs.  Look!

15:08.500 --> 15:10.025
Red herbs ...

15:11.900 --> 15:15.985
Siding with your beloved
Countess again.

15:16.140 --> 15:19.849
Once Lutheran ...  always a Lutheran.

15:22.740 --> 15:26.142
-I think she is innocent!
-You´re a surveyor!

15:26.300 --> 15:29.224
You mustn´t believe. You must see.

15:29.340 --> 15:31.591
He didn´t have our eyes cut out.

15:31.940 --> 15:35.786
The greater the legends,
so few facts.

15:35.940 --> 15:40.389
All what I believed  seemed
not to make sense.

15:40.500 --> 15:45.450
There were no vampires
or bloodbaths.

15:46.660 --> 15:48.071
Darvulia?

15:48.220 --> 15:52.384
What puzzled me was the  disappearance
of the witch Darvulia.

15:56.060 --> 16:00.702
It became a challenge for me,
a spy of the Cardinal Forgach,

16:00.900 --> 16:05.862
to find out who was behind
these strange events.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.486
Thurzo?

16:16.180 --> 16:19.470
Bytca - Thurzo family estate

16:24.060 --> 16:27.787
I am very happy you accepted
our invitation, Erzsebet.

16:28.260 --> 16:31.621
-How could I refuse?
-Welcome to our library!

16:32.220 --> 16:34.982
Countess Bathory brought
a  partner for dance, girls!

16:35.520 --> 16:37.573
They Pal to the garden.

16:39.220 --> 16:41.791
-Are you well?  -Very well, thank you.

16:41.980 --> 16:43.982
We are very happy that
you are healthy again.

16:44.180 --> 16:46.481
We have books here  in five languages.

16:46.740 --> 16:50.222
But I have another book,  I think
it will interest you more.

16:50.420 --> 16:54.630
Your king is missing
You are missing something to.

16:55.540 --> 16:58.999
-Where did you get my book?
-You draw very well.

16:59.860 --> 17:04.082
But you understand that
if Church finds out

17:05.060 --> 17:07.604
you´ll be burned alive.

17:11.339 --> 17:15.223
We all do this, don´t we?
But we must be discreet.

17:15.980 --> 17:19.858
All these rumours in the village,
about cutting up corpses,

17:19.980 --> 17:22.483
in the long run
it will harm you.

17:23.260 --> 17:25.148
As will the story about

17:25.150 --> 17:27.549
stabbing the maid to death with scissors.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.345
How did you know this?

17:35.900 --> 17:37.425
Darvulia?

17:41.100 --> 17:45.310
That old witch thought that you
and Thurzo are enemies.

17:45.460 --> 17:48.200
She came here crawling here
to give him your book.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.505
-How could you?
-I forgot to say ...

17:53.380 --> 17:56.827
She doesn´t have a tongue any more,
but still has a black soul.

17:56.980 --> 17:59.187
I´ll take her back.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.742
I told to get rid of that witch.

18:08.980 --> 18:12.462
Imagine if she had gone to someone
who wants to harm you.

18:12.620 --> 18:15.544
-Who wants to harm me?
-The Habsburgs.

18:15.550 --> 18:18.988
They paid the witch.
They want Hungary to be catholic again.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.931
And you, the most powerful
protestant in the land

18:22.000 --> 18:23.931
are standing in their way.

18:24.380 --> 18:26.747
I heard you want to become
the new Palatin.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.140
I can´t protect you.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.600
In Hungary, even a  powerful widow,

18:29.700 --> 18:32.350
can loose everything in the flash.

18:37.460 --> 18:40.560
As I already said,  I can
take care of myself.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.822
Mama, the girls go for Vienna
to see the new King Mathias.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.550
Can I go too?

18:46.800 --> 18:49.972
Please!  Please!

18:50.140 --> 18:54.384
Yes. You can´t miss a royal ball.
Monterverdi will show us his new Opera,

18:54.540 --> 19:00.000
and the painter Caravaggio exhibits
a painting in the Cathedral.

19:00.204 --> 19:01.460
Caravaggio?

19:01.740 --> 19:05.067
We are much stuff as dreams are made on.

19:05.460 --> 19:10.671
He, who yields for power and wealth,
would even sell his soul to hell.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.671
That was my bitter truth.

19:24.820 --> 19:28.222
VIENNA - CAPITAL of
THE HOLY Roman Empire

19:51.940 --> 19:55.062
You still have the smile  and
the eyes of the Mona Lisa.

19:55.980 --> 19:57.470
Merisi!

19:59.060 --> 20:02.259
So, you´d rather want to see
Monterverdis work in progress

20:02.380 --> 20:04.782
than see my completed masterpiece?

20:21.130 --> 20:23.349
The painting´s not good enough.

20:25.820 --> 20:29.222
You far more beautiful than my Madonna.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.200
And older.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.766
Paintings capture you for eternity.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.841
I have to see your birthmark again.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.664
Not here. Its a sin.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.483
At least we don´t need
to go far for confess.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.080
You once gave me a ring.

21:46.140 --> 21:48.065
I had to sell it to
to get back home.

21:48.066 --> 21:49.776
Here´s one for you.

21:51.140 --> 21:55.507
It will bring you luck.
Blue like the Venetian rose.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.306
I´m offering you my eternal friendship.

22:03.340 --> 22:06.802
King Mathias wants to see you.
You like my mask?

22:09.300 --> 22:11.409
Glad to see that  you´re
having fun.

22:14.340 --> 22:17.100
I´m glad you accepted my  suggestions
to come to Vienna.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.728
She´s not as smart as you thought.

22:28.420 --> 22:33.659
God, have mercy for me.
Forgive me, please.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.223
Let her remember my prophecy.

22:37.500 --> 22:41.949
Not that she´s past
beyond my protection.

22:42.140 --> 22:45.015
Let her come under yours.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.223
Your Majesty,  Countess
Erzsebet Bathory,

22:58.180 --> 23:03.305
whose unfading beauty
has become a legend.

23:10.272 --> 23:12.774
Countess, I wish to know your secret.

23:12.775 --> 23:16.769
-What secret?
-From your eternal youth.

23:19.180 --> 23:23.822
If you tell the king yours secret
he will let you see your future.

23:23.980 --> 23:29.300
My seer is blind,  but she can see
the future clearly.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.639
You will not be satisfied.

23:44.900 --> 23:47.510
You are on a journey,
and you travelling faster and faster

23:51.130 --> 23:53.791
You are going towards the flames.

23:53.980 --> 23:57.746
You´re conspiring with the devil!
The end is near you.

23:57.900 --> 24:00.602
Do not believe everything
what you hear, Countess.

24:14.660 --> 24:15.881
All this time,

24:15.990 --> 24:18.381
you´ve been paving my way to hell.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.711
On the contrary.

24:20.020 --> 24:22.551
I am here to ensure your  safety
and your interests.

24:22.860 --> 24:24.942
And yet, you reject me.

24:25.140 --> 24:27.983
You see what will happen to you,
without my protection!

24:28.660 --> 24:30.351
I seek protection from the king.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.551
I am the only one who can help you.

24:34.940 --> 24:37.407
Now, I want a third of your property

24:37.940 --> 24:40.620
or the prophecy of the Gipsy
will become true tomorrow!

24:40.621 --> 24:42.823
God! Not even you  could go that far!

24:43.980 --> 24:47.666
We could have done this the easy way
without involving the king,

24:47.667 --> 24:50.551
if you weren´t so stubborn!
This is my last offer.

24:50.660 --> 24:54.062
No matter what you do,
you will never see me on my knees.

24:54.180 --> 24:58.569
Oh yes, I will.
perhaps not today,
but eventually tomorrow.

24:58.570 --> 25:01.022
Soon I will be the second
man of the kingdom.

25:01.023 --> 25:02.401
Bastard!

25:03.340 --> 25:05.741
Just a word from  and everything
can change.

25:05.860 --> 25:09.399
One day you will realize that  I´m
better than your Ferenc.

25:14.940 --> 25:16.499
The king is backing me.

25:29.660 --> 25:31.600
Cut the maids bellies open,

25:31.831 --> 25:36.668
so the Countess can
take a warm bath.

25:43.700 --> 25:46.341
When you finished,
leave by the back door.

25:52.116 --> 25:54.559
Royal Guard,  at your positions!

26:03.420 --> 26:07.417
Open the doors.  Fast! Come on, men!

26:07.418 --> 26:08.418
Move!

26:13.540 --> 26:15.441
Where is the Countess?

26:23.860 --> 26:27.109
Since when a captain enters
the chambers of a Countess

26:27.110 --> 26:28.876
without permission?

26:38.420 --> 26:40.741
Darvulia!  Darvulia!

26:44.060 --> 26:45.471
Darvulia?

26:49.560 --> 26:50.671
No!

26:51.976 --> 26:53.471
No!

26:56.100 --> 27:01.231
No! No! No!

27:10.540 --> 27:15.265
Forgive me, Darvulia.
I swear that I will avenge you.

27:21.060 --> 27:24.507
From now on, profits
profits from our land

27:24.508 --> 27:26.827
will go to my nephew Gabor
in Transylvania.

27:27.180 --> 27:30.279
Are you sure?
Gabor is a distant relative.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.030
Gabor is the only one  I trust

27:32.031 --> 27:33.860
and the only one,
 whose army the king fears.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.788
You´re making decisions about money
that eventually will be ours.

27:38.260 --> 27:43.687
There will only be one ??? to the family estate, Pal.

27:44.980 --> 27:46.550
You will need his protection

27:46.551 --> 27:49.351
and the single way to do this,
is to remain strong.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.350
What about us?
We married your daughters.

27:52.460 --> 27:55.910
-What do we get?
You will get his protection to.

28:05.079 --> 28:08.270
PART III  Thurzo

28:09.780 --> 28:13.148
Long live palatine Thurzo!
Long live the champion!

28:13.780 --> 28:18.265
Pressburg
Seat of the Hungarian Palatine

28:24.780 --> 28:26.818
I´ll get her next time.

28:28.420 --> 28:32.074
Swear you are doing this
for us, not for her.

28:32.860 --> 28:35.588
Get out.  Get out.

28:57.380 --> 28:59.232
Don´t sleep, Erzsebet.

29:00.900 --> 29:04.580
Wake up!  Wake up!

29:06.234 --> 29:08.234
Get up.

29:09.140 --> 29:12.661
Why can´t you find peace
in your grave, Darvulia?

29:23.540 --> 29:27.770
Alarm!
Alarm!  Intruders in the castle!

29:29.500 --> 29:31.823
Intruders in the castle!

29:37.220 --> 29:38.631
Alarm!

29:40.340 --> 29:43.500
Leave it! Poison.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.963
Pal ...

29:48.784 --> 29:50.063
My son ...

29:51.780 --> 29:53.750
He tried to kill my son?

29:56.300 --> 30:01.223
Thurzo and his killers.
The third managed to escape.

30:06.920 --> 30:09.220
Throw their heads
to Thurzos doorstep.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.650
He wants to play, I´ll play!

30:12.740 --> 30:15.981
Turks!  Turks!

30:24.100 --> 30:27.388
The Turks!  Hide the children!

30:40.020 --> 30:43.573
Thurzo will know that this was us
and not the Turks, aunt Erzsebet.

30:43.820 --> 30:47.108
-That's what I wanted.
-I don´t think this is the end.

30:47.260 --> 30:50.503
He may threaten you.
If you need anything,

30:50.504 --> 30:55.328
send me a message and I bring
my entire Army.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.029
Thank you, Gabor.

31:01.780 --> 31:03.792
I have bad news for you.

31:04.360 --> 31:07.684
The Italian painter he´s dead.

31:08.660 --> 31:11.008
-Caravaggio?  -God bless his soul!

31:12.180 --> 31:14.811
He died of fever ...  alone.

31:16.180 --> 31:17.627
I had no chance...

31:20.480 --> 31:22.477
to say goodbye.

31:50.143 --> 31:53.981
A painting can preserve  what time destroys.

31:55.818 --> 31:57.749
Nothing lasts, Merisi.

31:59.360 --> 32:02.147
Not even the faces in paintings.

32:07.660 --> 32:11.188
Why are, all the people I love,
leaving me.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.650
This was a warning.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.847
This pig from Transylvania,  Gabor

32:20.848 --> 32:22.597
has burned your third village.

32:23.020 --> 32:24.869
He´s willing to declare
war on the king,

32:24.870 --> 32:26.489
to protect his aunt.

32:26.490 --> 32:29.364
We need to take the bitch
to  court immediately.

32:29.780 --> 32:31.573
We can´t get the Countess to court,

32:32.060 --> 32:34.733
unless we have six nobles
to testify against her.

32:35.228 --> 32:37.292
Why don´t we just lay
siege to her castle?

32:37.293 --> 32:39.134
It can take months,  perhaps years.

32:39.420 --> 32:43.585
No, the single way  to make it,
is to catch her inflagranti delicto 

32:44.670 --> 32:46.183
in the act of murder,

32:46.500 --> 32:49.097
and get witnesses  for
her abomination.

33:05.933 --> 33:08.188
-No, stop!  -Stop!

33:12.190 --> 33:17.622
Father, the Countess went crazy.
She´s killing in daylight.

33:43.607 --> 33:45.318
The devil came back.

33:47.419 --> 33:49.470
I have to inform  the Palatine.

33:51.900 --> 33:54.392
In this letter, Pastor
Ponicky asks the king

33:55.254 --> 33:57.180
and me as the new Palatine,

33:58.802 --> 34:01.647
to put an end to the killings
of Countess Bathory.

34:01.682 --> 34:04.245
As a noble,  she has the right

34:04.345 --> 34:06.280
to put her subjects to death.

34:06.281 --> 34:08.183
We´re talking about
dozens of murders.

34:08.340 --> 34:13.572
The pastor says here that
she turns into a black cat.

34:13.940 --> 34:19.228
If we can´t accuse her of witchcraft...
That will work

34:19.737 --> 34:21.735
She gets burned as a witch.

34:22.331 --> 34:24.675
The church will confiscate her property

34:25.980 --> 34:30.358
and we are defending the  interests
of the king, don´t we?

34:30.801 --> 34:34.549
SARVAR

34:39.020 --> 34:42.263
You are very angry,
when you fight.
That's not such good thing.

34:42.264 --> 34:44.183
Anger is my best weapon, Bathany.

34:47.300 --> 34:49.998
A message from Cachtice, Mylady.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.999
My war is not over yet.
I must return to Cachtice.

34:59.660 --> 35:01.369
Thurzo is making his next move.

35:06.820 --> 35:09.816
Every castle can be conquered...
from within!

35:10.300 --> 35:12.268
Cachtice is not conquerable.

35:13.700 --> 35:17.774
It protected me from the Turks.
I will protect from Thurzo.

35:20.980 --> 35:23.631
I´ve made up my mind.
I´m going.

35:25.740 --> 35:27.885
Not her, Margita. Not here.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.464
Margita!  Margita!

35:34.500 --> 35:37.510
You´´re kissing a catholic?
Go and wash your mouth.

35:38.540 --> 35:39.885
He wants to marry me!

35:39.900 --> 35:42.148
And convert back to our faith, for me.

35:42.860 --> 35:45.389
Then you want to marry a renegade?
Get out!

35:46.100 --> 35:47.226
No!

35:47.460 --> 35:51.222
Take your hands of her, or you will
lose more than one ear.

35:55.860 --> 35:58.340
We are no longer welcome here.

36:05.740 --> 36:10.829
In not going back to the monastery.
I´m tired of being a spy.

36:13.020 --> 36:15.651
They´ll send other spies.  Listen ...

36:23.870 --> 36:25.286
Divine music.

36:27.020 --> 36:29.904
We haven´t managed to
remove prince Gabor

36:29.905 --> 36:32.182
but the Bathory case is going well.

36:32.340 --> 36:37.062
Many witnesses testified
about her crimes.

36:37.580 --> 36:41.380
If you manage to achieve this,
I´ll give you a fat salary.

36:43.640 --> 36:44.721
Who is this?

36:44.722 --> 36:49.612
Count Druget, husband of Katarine,
a family member.

36:50.380 --> 36:53.685
I can no longer keep the crimes
  of countess Bathory secret.

36:55.180 --> 36:59.920
And if she is arrested, her property
will be confiscated by the Crown.

37:00.620 --> 37:03.066
But you said it would be
divided between us.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.522
There is a solution,

37:04.523 --> 37:09.183
its unpleasant, but if you´ll both be loyal
it can work.

37:09.380 --> 37:10.903
You can count on us.

37:11.420 --> 37:15.489
In this case, her property
 goes neither to the king or church.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.141
It will stay within the family -
that's you.

37:20.330 --> 37:21.674
And it will be divided

37:21.675 --> 37:25.131
equally between you and your protector,

37:25.942 --> 37:27.294
that's me.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.845
And if she is innocent?

37:37.180 --> 37:42.314
Now, I want both of you
to swear agreement to this plan.

37:49.940 --> 37:54.510
Your father protected
Hungary with this sword

37:56.020 --> 38:01.488
and before him, his father,
and his grandfather.

38:14.580 --> 38:17.205
Uncle Gabor will teach you how to use it,

38:18.620 --> 38:20.585
and you´ll be our protector.

38:25.260 --> 38:26.944
The blood of our family.

38:40.137 --> 38:45.205
Whatever happens,  you
remember who you are

38:46.533 --> 38:48.106
and where you belong.

38:48.260 --> 38:49.466
Yes

39:02.740 --> 39:04.739
Forgive me for arriving unannounced.

39:05.620 --> 39:08.230
Anna and I did  plans for Christmas.

39:08.480 --> 39:12.808
We think that we should spend the
holiday together as a family.

39:12.809 --> 39:13.884
Sorry.

39:13.903 --> 39:15.233
Druget and Katalin  agreed.

39:15.234 --> 39:16.683
No, Miklos.

39:17.035 --> 39:19.204
I promised Pal,
that we spend New Year

39:19.304 --> 39:20.994
in Transylvania, with my family.

39:21.740 --> 39:23.602
We must go  before Christmas.

39:24.060 --> 39:27.785
But your daughters were so looking forward
to your company.

39:29.660 --> 39:34.141
Stay at least for Christmas.
I really want to see my sisters, mama.

39:37.380 --> 39:41.769
A few days won´t make any difference.
Come!

39:51.980 --> 39:54.425
There must be a traitor
amongst your servants.

39:54.660 --> 39:57.947
How else would Thurzo know
when you wanted to leave?

40:01.540 --> 40:03.047
He´s planning something.

40:03.860 --> 40:07.621
The have stationed Royal Guard patrols
around Cachtice.

40:07.622 --> 40:09.509
The town´s been sealed off.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.075
Get him.

40:13.860 --> 40:16.667
Your safety is at stake, your grace.

40:17.180 --> 40:19.508
Don´t worry, Gabor will protect me.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.548
I will send him a message
to come after Christmas

40:22.549 --> 40:24.019
with his Swiss Army.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.831
Until then l, will celebrate
birth of Our Lord,

40:27.232 --> 40:29.891
right here in the castle,
with my family.

40:30.280 --> 40:34.789
I promised to Pal.  For your services.

40:37.690 --> 40:40.867
-Remember me in your prayers.  -Thanks.

40:46.180 --> 40:50.799
They sent a message!
It´s from the castle! Kill the pigeon!

40:59.300 --> 41:01.667
Cachtice,  29 DECEMBER 1610

41:09.940 --> 41:14.218
Ficzko, this will warm you up.

41:30.020 --> 41:33.991
That was wonderful.
Girls, give candy to children!

41:34.460 --> 41:37.187
Everybody in the castle!
Guests arrive soon!

41:38.300 --> 41:40.371
Lucia, come with me!

41:40.892 --> 41:42.492
Hurry, hurry.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.616
a pity that in the can´t
go with you, my lady.

41:51.909 --> 41:53.363
Especially now ...

41:53.782 --> 41:55.984
I learned to open  my veins alone.

41:56.740 --> 41:59.506
I know you want to help me
but I need only herbs.

42:00.660 --> 42:02.578
I can´t even look at blood any more.

42:04.901 --> 42:06.999
Dorota, what you  are doing here?

42:08.623 --> 42:10.747
I forgot to close the window.

42:11.500 --> 42:12.865
Go on!

42:19.260 --> 42:21.370
This my gift for Christmas for you.

42:22.900 --> 42:26.063
Take all the herbs
to Ficzko, at the castle,

42:31.460 --> 42:33.089
and go home.

42:33.380 --> 42:35.311
Freedom for me  and for my family?

42:36.200 --> 42:40.332
-I don't deserve this.
-Yes, you do, Lucia.

42:42.500 --> 42:44.224
You are like a daughter to me.

42:46.380 --> 42:48.675
May I kiss you goodbye, my lady?

43:21.010 --> 43:22.291
Its almost dark.

43:23.180 --> 43:25.131
I´m worried that Lucia
is not home yet.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.701
Ficzko!
Mylady has set us free!

43:34.020 --> 43:37.911
-Where were you?  -Don´t come closer!

43:40.300 --> 43:41.525
Who are you?

43:47.620 --> 43:50.490
-Wasn´t it Lucia?  Lucia?

43:50.740 --> 43:53.550
What would she do in
Church at this hour?

43:53.610 --> 43:55.590
However, it  have been somebody.

44:01.420 --> 44:03.630
-Someone´s definitely here..
H-yes ...

44:04.820 --> 44:06.743
You see the light?

44:10.180 --> 44:11.728
Where does this lead?

44:23.220 --> 44:25.713
-Shit!  -Cyril, God hears you!

44:26.300 --> 44:27.999
Don´t get your feet wet, Father.

44:31.940 --> 44:34.557
I found the church, you want
it closed, no?

44:41.940 --> 44:44.943
What is the Royal guard doing here?

44:53.414 --> 44:55.218
Ficzko is the traitor.

44:55.219 --> 44:58.436
It looks like a secret way
to the castle.

45:01.620 --> 45:04.888
Open the gate!  It´s me, Zrinyi!

45:05.200 --> 45:06.999
Master Zrinyi!

45:11.580 --> 45:13.423
The countess awaits you.

45:21.080 --> 45:23.276
I pray to God to save us!

45:24.445 --> 45:25.655
Father.

45:28.207 --> 45:30.317
Poor girls.  Let´s help them.

45:35.580 --> 45:38.680
Go, go, go, go!

45:51.180 --> 45:53.447
Get out here.
You´ll be safe in the bell tower.

45:53.448 --> 45:56.059
Go, go! Here.

45:56.060 --> 45:57.886
Quick, Cyril!  Quick!

46:01.540 --> 46:07.107
-Leave me alone!
-Where are the little bitches?

46:08.620 --> 46:12.130
They have fled.
You didn´t tied them up properly..

46:13.460 --> 46:16.669
-Ficzko!  -Its you, you scum!

46:26.711 --> 46:27.972
Lets go, Lucia.

46:38.520 --> 46:39.587
Who are you?

46:41.900 --> 46:45.488
-Dora?  -Don´t kill me, Ficzko!

46:48.860 --> 46:50.645
I must warn her grace.

46:55.420 --> 46:58.048
Thurzo!  You pig!

47:02.100 --> 47:05.981
God, just do something!

47:06.380 --> 47:08.870
Now is the time for one of Your miracles.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.545
Damn!

47:17.390 --> 47:20.530
Make way for the Palatine Thurzo.
Clear!

47:28.580 --> 47:31.186
Hurry, Pal!  You have to hide.

47:33.460 --> 47:35.894
I wasn´t expecting so many guests.

47:39.140 --> 47:43.048
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas to you!

47:45.180 --> 47:47.415
I heard, that you were leaving.

47:48.460 --> 47:50.999
And I couldn´t let you go,
without saying goodbye.

47:51.740 --> 47:53.086
Enough of this.

47:54.197 --> 47:57.999
Erzsebet Bathory, I arrest you
in the name of the king

47:58.000 --> 48:01.303
for imprisoning, torturing,
and murdering young women

48:01.304 --> 48:02.934
in the dungeons of your castle.

48:07.180 --> 48:10.558
You can not arrest a noble woman
without witnesses of equal rank.

48:11.380 --> 48:14.623
You´re breaking the law.
The law doesn´t applies here,

48:14.624 --> 48:19.385
cause I caught in the act.
Take her into the dungeons!

48:22.420 --> 48:23.999
Find her son!

48:28.780 --> 48:30.184
You´re a traitor!

48:30.700 --> 48:32.270
Stop!  Stop!

48:32.960 --> 48:34.286
Stop!

48:34.386 --> 48:37.201
- So, you got me, no?
-Where are the girls?

48:37.940 --> 48:40.399
-Where are they?  -The girls fled!

48:41.100 --> 48:43.601
We did everything as ordered, my lord.

48:44.060 --> 48:46.885
What are you talking about,
you stupid whore?

48:48.140 --> 48:52.031
-Those monks released them!  -Find them.

48:52.110 --> 48:53.699
Come!

48:57.740 --> 48:59.626
They are herbs.

49:00.212 --> 49:02.826
In the eyes of most people, its evidence.

49:04.860 --> 49:07.764
People like over legends more than truth.

49:07.980 --> 49:12.113
Just one word  and everything
can be different.

49:12.900 --> 49:16.427
What will it be?  Stalemate or checkmate?

49:38.180 --> 49:39.250
Checkmate.

49:39.792 --> 49:42.797
One move. Only one move

49:42.823 --> 49:44.743
and I send you straight
to hell,  where you belong.

49:47.340 --> 49:49.999
-Lower your weapons!
-Do what she sends.

49:50.740 --> 49:53.664
Ilona, Katalin.  Arrest them.

49:56.940 --> 49:58.350
Ficzko, what´s going on?

50:00.940 --> 50:02.750
Drop your weapons.  Open the gates.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.849
Drop!  Drop!

50:05.950 --> 50:07.948
Get Pal.
He´s in the secret chamber.

50:08.029 --> 50:09.518
Yes, my lady.

50:09.619 --> 50:11.670
-Drop your weapons!
-So the paladin orders.

50:11.770 --> 50:14.502
an order from Palatine Thurzo...

50:15.670 --> 50:17.172
an order from the Palatine ...

50:17.520 --> 50:18.945
Sit.

50:20.740 --> 50:22.105
Open the doors!

50:22.220 --> 50:25.497
Open the doors!  Let the Countess out!

50:28.060 --> 50:30.240
Countess, you´ve been betrayed!

50:32.020 --> 50:35.530
Close the gates.  -Release the Palatine.

50:43.860 --> 50:46.215
Close the gates.  -Release the Palatine.

50:57.660 --> 51:02.368
-Mama, I won´t let them take you!
-Let him be! Let her be!

51:04.460 --> 51:07.828
-Pal!  -Mama, I will fight for you.

51:07.980 --> 51:10.711
You will obey the soldiers,
or they´ll hurt you.

51:10.820 --> 51:12.822
Yes, mama.  I´ll wait for you.

51:12.940 --> 51:18.185
Remember, I will always be yours
and you´ll always be mine.

51:18.900 --> 51:20.140
I love you.

51:25.580 --> 51:27.870
Mama ...

51:28.340 --> 51:32.948
-Pal! Pal!  -I love you, mama!

51:33.260 --> 51:38.949
Pal, I will always be yours  and
you´ll always be mine.

51:42.900 --> 51:45.585
We found a bag  full of frogs.

51:45.740 --> 51:47.541
-We found chests full of jewels.
- Make an inventory.

51:47.660 --> 51:48.941
Okay.

51:48.962 --> 51:52.185
Palatine Thurzo
found new evidence.

51:52.340 --> 51:56.743
The mutilated bodies of girls,
buried in the garden of the manor house.

51:56.988 --> 51:59.107
And for those who  mocked me

51:59.207 --> 52:02.494
when I compared  this heartless beast

52:02.802 --> 52:05.133
a to bloodthirsty vampire ...

52:05.140 --> 52:09.999
Come to the table and sign
testimony of what you have seen.

52:10.240 --> 52:14.930
You, you ...  and you.

52:16.260 --> 52:19.309
-A gold necklace, seven diamonds.
Seven-diamond ...

52:19.420 --> 52:21.361
An Emerald  size of a coin.

52:21.820 --> 52:23.470
A ruby necklace ...  A ruby necklace ...

52:23.620 --> 52:25.306
-with a pendant ...
-with a pendant ...

52:25.420 --> 52:29.306
Four-diamond in a ring.
Four-diamond ...

52:31.780 --> 52:35.021
This my last message
for you, Cardinal.

52:36.260 --> 52:37.830
God!

52:47.780 --> 52:53.266
Good good, what beautiful
wings you gave to the angels.

52:54.620 --> 52:58.102
A pity that you didn´t
also gave us wings,

52:58.300 --> 53:00.701
so that we go high a see

53:00.900 --> 53:04.106
how small pitiable we are.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.467
Why have we stopped?

53:10.660 --> 53:12.467
The horses fear the wolves.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.655
Catch the whore!

53:19.540 --> 53:20.999
Stop, whore!

53:26.871 --> 53:29.026
You idiot! We needed her alive.

53:29.726 --> 53:32.411
You pay for this with your head.

53:34.420 --> 53:35.764
Dorota Sentesz,

53:35.820 --> 53:39.404
Countess had  record of here victims?

53:39.460 --> 53:43.369
Yes, she wrote their
names in a book.

53:43.980 --> 53:47.606
-How many were they?
- Don´t say anything ...

53:48.340 --> 53:50.630
Thirty-!  -Liar!

53:52.820 --> 53:56.727
Thirty a month!  -Whore! You whore.

54:21.460 --> 54:25.667
Cyril, you must leave now.
God bless you!

54:27.140 --> 54:29.268
Bytca
2. JANUARY 1611

54:29.380 --> 54:33.146
As prosecutor of the king, I demand
the most severe punishment

54:33.260 --> 54:37.949
for these accomplices
who participated in the crimes.

54:38.020 --> 54:40.191
Hear the verdict!

54:40.700 --> 54:43.688
Janos Ujvary, nickname Ficzko,

54:43.690 --> 54:48.064
Ilona Jo, Katalin Beniczka
and Dorota Sentesz

54:48.582 --> 54:52.906
shall be taken to a place
close to this court.

54:53.060 --> 54:57.941
And will have their fingers plucked,  except
Ficzko, who will be beheaded.

54:58.100 --> 55:03.106
The Countess Erzsebet Bathory
is sentenced to a life in jail,

55:04.300 --> 55:06.667
isolated from the rest of the world.

55:06.860 --> 55:11.024
A red gallows will erected red
at the castle of Cachtice,

55:11.460 --> 55:14.430
symbolizing here slow death.

55:50.083 --> 55:52.347
Kill the pigs!

56:11.243 --> 56:13.747
I am innocent!

56:15.380 --> 56:17.717
I am innocent!

56:18.860 --> 56:20.967
I am innocent!

56:30.371 --> 56:33.265
You imprisoned Countess
Bathory in here castle

56:33.271 --> 56:34.631
against her will.

56:34.720 --> 56:38.124
Yes, but I have hundreds of
testimony of witnesses.

56:38.980 --> 56:41.985
Yes, but they all commoners.

56:42.500 --> 56:44.941
The evidence won´t be
inadmissible in court.

56:45.580 --> 56:47.947
Your majesty are telling me something?

56:48.100 --> 56:49.823
Has the political climate changed?

56:50.140 --> 56:52.320
Noble can not be above the law.

56:52.740 --> 56:56.267
I, Mathias II, will not allow
the imprisonment of a noble woman

56:56.420 --> 56:58.669
without substantial prove of guilt.

57:00.100 --> 57:02.627
The Countess Bathory was  sentenced
in her absence.

57:03.780 --> 57:06.543
She could not defend herself.

57:07.100 --> 57:09.421
All the general witnesses
have been executed

57:09.540 --> 57:12.925
with a speed than  I can describe
only as suspicious.

57:18.380 --> 57:22.704
If you can not show that you
have been acting in good faith,

57:23.020 --> 57:24.655
God have mercy on you!

57:32.540 --> 57:34.639
There mustn´t be a court here, Cardinal.

57:35.240 --> 57:37.663
The king turned against you, Count.

57:38.980 --> 57:41.324
You may have executed the witnesses

57:41.980 --> 57:44.620
but Erzsebet Bathory can not may remain in

57:44.680 --> 57:46.720
her castle forever.

57:47.455 --> 57:50.729
-Unless ...  -Unless, what?

57:52.110 --> 57:56.671
Unless you think the Church can benefit

57:56.780 --> 58:00.769
from the profits you removed
from her castle.

58:03.260 --> 58:08.027
For example, nine chests
of treasure, a necklace ...

58:10.660 --> 58:14.827
Well, I like to win,

58:19.500 --> 58:21.888
but I can be a  good loser as well.

58:27.290 --> 58:31.290
The one thing that I require in exchange,
are the names of the monks.

58:32.460 --> 58:36.500
I can not help you.  Both are dead.

58:45.140 --> 58:48.991
Lord, how can one handle this?

58:50.660 --> 58:55.528
Who else can straighten
what was left?

58:56.940 --> 59:01.240
Is justice only
for the most powerful?

59:01.340 --> 59:04.742
Cachtice Castle
Black tower, 1614

59:06.880 --> 59:11.914
Excuse me, my lady,  a
monk want to see you.

59:19.500 --> 59:20.767
Your grace.

59:25.980 --> 59:27.141
Peter!

59:28.860 --> 59:30.788
Don´t look at me like that.

59:33.780 --> 59:37.057
I know, I´ve aged.

59:39.500 --> 59:43.792
What´s happening outside?
Here I have no news.

59:45.540 --> 59:47.898
Thurzo is playing  on both sides,

59:48.660 --> 59:53.605
but he has a single goal
to dispossess your family.

59:57.340 --> 01:00:02.445
Why isn´t Gabor doing something?
Gabor, he´s dead.

01:00:03.188 --> 01:00:05.548
He was killed by his own people.

01:00:06.676 --> 01:00:09.038
Thurzo is probably behind that.

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.091
The Habsburgs are gaining.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.486
I´m afraid to ask about Pal.

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.904
Zrinyi is now his guardian.

01:00:30.905 --> 01:00:33.881
He is under pressure to renounce you.

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.575
My son would never renounce me.

01:01:15.347 --> 01:01:17.195
You need to give him  my will.

01:01:18.971 --> 01:01:20.978
He´ll need it.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.341
You must not let Thurzo win.

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:32.183
If I still believed, that is God Almighty

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.382
I would pray for you.

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.828
I was born at a time
that was not right for me.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.689
I´m not as strong as thought.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.269
Remember me  when I leave.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.741
Lord ...

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.535
The weight of the cross you placed
on my shoulders is to much for me.

01:02:29.903 --> 01:02:32.231
Save my soul.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.664
Erzsebet Bathory will be given a dignified funeral.

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.999
But she committed suicide, Palatine.

01:04:11.945 --> 01:04:14.825
She was heard singing
a hymn as burned.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.301
She killed others  and
then killed himself.

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.321
She may be buried in  hallowed ground.

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.658
She can not be buried in sanctified soil.

01:04:27.075 --> 01:04:28.896
Who gave you the  right to judge?

01:04:30.442 --> 01:04:32.262
She made the move  most daring of all.

01:04:33.281 --> 01:04:35.516
One that I never expected.

01:04:37.683 --> 01:04:40.895
With this move,  she won the game.

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.630
I loved her.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.447
THURZO SURVIVED ERZSEBET BATHORY
BY NO MORE THAN TWO  YEARS.

01:05:06.841 --> 01:05:09.108
HIS HARD-EARNED WEALTH WAS SOON APPROPRIATED

01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:12.204
BY COUNT ESTERHAZY, WHO HAD REPLACED HIM

01:05:12.205 --> 01:05:15.054
IN THE OFFICE OF HUNGARIAN PALATINE.

01:05:15.554 --> 01:05:18.524
THURZOS WIDOW DIED IN POVERTY AND SOLITUDE.

01:05:18.934 --> 01:05:23.500
PAL NADASY´S  LINE CONTINUES
UNTIL THIS VERY DAY

01:05:23.934 --> 01:05:25.932
BECAUSE OF THURZO´S UNSUBSTANTIATED ACCUSATIONS,

01:05:25.933 --> 01:05:28.084
COUNTESS ERZSEBET BATHORY IS LISTEN
IN THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS

01:05:28.085 --> 01:05:31.254
ASS THE GREATEST MURDERESS OF ALL TIME.
