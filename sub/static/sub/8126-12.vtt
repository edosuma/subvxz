00:56.221 --> 00:58.690
- Mother!
- Oh, I'll be with you

Your father wants

Gloria!

What are you doing up?
You're supposed
to be resting.

01:35.027 --> 01:38.529
I know, mom,
but you're so busy,
and I want a cup of tea.

01:38.597 --> 01:41.733
[ Archie ] Edith, you dingbat!
You brung me
the milk of magnesia!

01:46.072 --> 01:49.774
I got 'em mixed up.
I'm sorry, Archie!

01:49.842 --> 01:52.711
<i>That's all right, mom.</i>
<i>I'll get the tea.</i>
<i>No! I'll get the tea.</i>

01:52.778 --> 01:55.379
You go down and rest.
<i>[ Archie ]</i>
<i>Edith, come on!</i>

[ Mike ]
Ma!
She's in the kitchen!

02:00.753 --> 02:05.223
What? I can't hear you!
I said,
she's in the kitchen!

02:05.290 --> 02:09.360
Mike, God, you know
how lousy I feel!
Must you make me scream?

02:10.795 --> 02:12.797
What did you say?

02:12.865 --> 02:15.499
I need some orange juice, ma!

02:15.567 --> 02:18.402
[ Archie ]
Edith, come on!
Here's your tea, dear.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.739
Nice and hot.
Thank you, ma.

Edith, you got me
walkin' a plank!
The kaopectate!

02:26.411 --> 02:30.414
Coming, Archie!
Don't forget the ginger ale
to kill the taste of it!

02:30.482 --> 02:34.786
Oh, ginger ale.
[ Panting ]
Oh-oh, my.

02:34.854 --> 02:39.190
Stop, ma.
Enough is enough.
Daddy, Michael,

02:39.258 --> 02:43.027
you two bundle up
and come down here before
ma falls on her face!

02:43.095 --> 02:45.196
Come on, ma.
You gotta sit down and rest.

02:45.264 --> 02:49.600
Well, I'll be all right
just as soon as
I catch my breath.

02:49.668 --> 02:51.602
Oh, my!

02:51.670 --> 02:54.338
It wasn't so bad
the first two days...

02:54.406 --> 02:57.909
When I wasn't so tired
and you wasn't so sick.

02:57.977 --> 03:01.079
Oh, ma, we just gotta send
for cousin maude
to come and help out,

03:01.147 --> 03:03.014
or you're gonna
get sick too.

03:03.082 --> 03:07.952
I phoned her, but
your father sent her a telegram
and told her not to come.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.121
He won't have her around.

03:10.189 --> 03:13.391
[ Coughing ]

03:13.458 --> 03:17.361
Where's the kaopectate?
Don't you wanna open
the ginger ale first?

03:17.429 --> 03:19.630
There ain't no time
for the ginger ale now.

03:21.801 --> 03:24.269
Oh, geez! Edith,
get the ginger ale now.

03:27.206 --> 03:31.342
How could you mix up
milk of magnesia
with kaopectate, Edith?

03:31.410 --> 03:35.713
It's like mixing up prune juice
with radiator sealant.

03:35.781 --> 03:38.382
Get out of my chair,
meathead!

03:38.450 --> 03:40.518
[ Groaning ]

03:40.585 --> 03:43.654
Come on, Edith, with
the ginger ale, huh?
Here you are, Archie.

03:43.722 --> 03:47.125
Daddy,
this has gotta stop.
We're killing mom.

03:47.193 --> 03:50.261
I don't know why
you won't let cousin maude
come and help out.

03:50.329 --> 03:52.263
Oh, go blow your nose!

03:52.331 --> 03:56.301
We ain't lettin' that woman
in this house, and that's
the end of the discussion.

03:56.368 --> 03:59.103
How could you hate her
through all these years?

03:59.171 --> 04:02.106
Are you kidding?
Archie's hatred's
like a fine wine.

04:02.174 --> 04:04.108
It mellows with age.

04:04.176 --> 04:07.879
Why don't you go take
a pill for yourself, huh?

04:07.947 --> 04:10.181
I need some vitamin "c."
I'll get it, Michael.

04:10.249 --> 04:14.886
You go sit down
on the sofa next to Gloria.
You can share the blanket.

04:14.954 --> 04:18.189
I'm not sittin' next to Gloria.
She's highly infectious!

04:18.257 --> 04:20.825
She's the one
I caught this thing from
in the first place.

04:20.892 --> 04:23.928
Don't you blame that on me.
I warned you I was
coming down with something.

04:23.996 --> 04:25.930
Why'd you have to kiss me?

04:25.998 --> 04:28.766
'Cause I liked you that day.

04:28.834 --> 04:32.603
[ Coughing ]
Aw, cut that out, huh?

04:32.671 --> 04:36.307
You're spraying all
your "infecterous" germs
over on me.

04:36.375 --> 04:40.444
Archie, if there's
no personal contact, there's
no danger of further infection.

04:40.512 --> 04:42.446
That's with regular germs.

04:42.514 --> 04:46.985
Them polack bugs of yours
are too dumb
to know the rules.

04:47.052 --> 04:50.955
[ Coughing ]
Thanks, ma.
Here you are, Mike.

04:51.023 --> 04:54.259
Ma? Ma, will you please
get me the nose spray?

04:54.326 --> 04:56.261
Yes, dear.
And some orange juice, ma.

04:56.328 --> 04:59.197
Wait a minute, Edith.
Hold it.
Stop runnin' around.

04:59.265 --> 05:03.301
Get over here.
Now, we're all gonna
be down here.

05:03.369 --> 05:08.406
I'm gonna make up some
rules here and regulations
and "priorororities."

05:08.473 --> 05:12.476
And the first "priorority"
is me, 'cause I'm the one
that's really sick.

05:12.544 --> 05:14.612
You're sick?

05:14.679 --> 05:18.116
My leg and my back muscles ache,
and I'm nauseous all the time.

05:18.183 --> 05:22.320
Oh, I feel for you, Gloria.
I really do.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.989
But you have one of
the lesser strains of the virus.

05:25.057 --> 05:27.725
I have the big one!
[ Exaggerated cough ]

05:27.793 --> 05:30.962
I'm the one!
I'm the guy!

05:31.030 --> 05:33.164
I'm the breadwinner
here, all right?

05:33.232 --> 05:36.200
And I gotta get well.
Geez.

05:36.268 --> 05:39.003
I gotta feed
three human beings
and a government mule.

05:41.506 --> 05:45.243
Now, if the two of youse
want anything, you'll just have
to serve yourselves, that's all,

05:45.311 --> 05:47.745
'cause Edith is gonna be
waitin' on me.

05:47.813 --> 05:49.747
I got a very
delicate condition.

05:49.815 --> 05:53.851
And keep the path clear
between here and the bathroom
at all times.

05:53.919 --> 05:57.721
Daddy, I think it's high time
we reconsidered cousin maude.

05:57.789 --> 06:00.058
Well,
you just forget that.
Oh, boy.

06:00.125 --> 06:04.329
She's the only relative
on the two sides of the family
that'll come when you need her,

06:04.396 --> 06:06.464
and you won't
have her around.

06:06.531 --> 06:08.666
I don't see what on earth
you've got against her.

06:08.733 --> 06:12.837
Well, she's a big mouth
buttinsky. She was from
the first day I met her.

06:12.904 --> 06:16.074
Oh. I remember that day.
[ Chuckles ]

06:16.141 --> 06:18.176
Maude and me
was sittin' in...

06:18.243 --> 06:23.047
The puritan maid
ice cream parlor,
havin' their special.

06:23.115 --> 06:27.452
It was called a steamboat.
Five flavors of ice cream,

06:27.519 --> 06:31.689
three different toppings--
whipped cream, marshmallow,

06:31.756 --> 06:34.792
butterscotch sauce--
all right, Edith!
Cut it out, huh?

06:34.860 --> 06:38.929
Will you lay off that stuff?
My belly's turnin' over here.

06:38.998 --> 06:41.499
No, go on, ma.
I wanna know what happened.

06:41.566 --> 06:44.902
Well, I'll tell it,
and I'll save you some time.

06:44.970 --> 06:49.573
Your mother and her cousin maude
were sittin' in the puritan maid
ice cream parlor, that's all.

06:49.641 --> 06:52.776
I was in there with
another guy, Rupert Pratt.

06:52.844 --> 06:55.480
Talkin' about gettin' sick.
You should've seen
Rupert Pratt...

06:55.547 --> 06:58.749
Turn his eyelids inside out.

06:58.817 --> 07:01.785
Well, anyway, I was in there,
and I was just, uh,

07:01.853 --> 07:04.022
tryin' to get your mother's
attention, that's all.

07:04.089 --> 07:07.392
- How'd you do that, daddy?
- He was so cute.

07:07.459 --> 07:10.594
I'm tellin' the story,
Edith.

07:10.662 --> 07:12.630
I was tryin' to make
your mother laugh.

07:12.697 --> 07:16.700
'Cause that was my--
what do you call--
style in them days.

07:16.768 --> 07:19.870
Oh, yeah.
You should've seen him.

07:19.938 --> 07:25.076
First, he stuffed
two straws up his nose
like a walrus.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.545
All right, Edith, eh?

07:27.612 --> 07:31.249
And then he made out
like he was shot in the belly,

07:31.316 --> 07:35.053
and he put his head back
like this and let
chocolate syrup...

07:35.120 --> 07:37.522
Drip out of
the corner of his mouth.

07:37.589 --> 07:39.690
Will you stifle yourself!

07:39.758 --> 07:43.127
Go on, ma.
Did he make you laugh?

07:43.195 --> 07:45.129
Oh, I'll say.
[ Chuckles ]

07:45.197 --> 07:47.198
Finally, he got up
and came over...

07:47.266 --> 07:50.068
To where maude and me
were sittin'.

07:50.135 --> 07:53.571
And while he looked at me
straight in the eye,

07:53.638 --> 07:56.274
your father
squished his hand...

07:56.341 --> 08:00.644
Right down into my steamboat.

08:00.712 --> 08:03.147
Well, I had to laugh,

08:03.215 --> 08:08.586
'cause there he was
up to here in five flavors,
three toppings--

08:08.653 --> 08:12.490
marshmallow,
whipped cream--
all right, Edith, huh?

08:12.558 --> 08:15.226
We all heard
how you make a steamboat.

08:15.294 --> 08:17.895
If you want to
tell 'em something,
why don't you tell 'em...

08:17.963 --> 08:21.532
What your cousin maude,
that gorgeous
cousin maude of yours,

08:21.600 --> 08:23.534
said to me on that occasion.

08:23.602 --> 08:27.972
Well, she said--
oh, Archie, you really
want me to repeat it?

08:28.039 --> 08:30.241
Certainly.
Let the two of 'em know.

08:30.309 --> 08:33.777
Let 'em know what
a no-class person she really is.

08:33.845 --> 08:36.581
Well, she said that...

08:36.648 --> 08:39.883
She hadn't seen
nothin' so disgustin'...

08:39.951 --> 08:44.489
Since her kid brother
heaved up his whole dinner
at his confirmation.

08:46.191 --> 08:49.160
There. Hear that?

08:49.228 --> 08:51.329
Nice, huh?

08:51.396 --> 08:55.733
I pull off the funniest stunt
in the whole history of the
puritan maid ice cream parlor,

08:55.800 --> 08:59.903
and maude comes up
with a revoltin' story
about confirmation.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.107
I hate that dame.

09:03.175 --> 09:07.378
Well, she ain't too crazy
about you neither.

09:07.446 --> 09:11.915
Ever since that fight
your father and maude had
one Christmas,

09:11.983 --> 09:14.952
when she caught him drawin'
horns and a moustache...

09:15.020 --> 09:17.921
On a picture
of president Roosevelt.

09:17.989 --> 09:20.291
Cousin maude liked
Roosevelt, huh, ma?
Oh, yeah.

09:20.359 --> 09:22.760
She was nuts about the guy.

09:22.827 --> 09:27.131
Once, she ran 30 blocks
up Broadway during a parade...

09:27.199 --> 09:30.334
Just to catch up with his car
and touch his hand.

09:30.402 --> 09:33.404
Certainly. She was
a new deal fanatic.

09:33.472 --> 09:35.973
Oh, boy, I'm feelin'
lousier by the minute.

09:36.041 --> 09:41.179
Aw, quit complainin', huh?
Cut out the fakin'
with that thermometer there.

09:41.246 --> 09:44.915
Fakin', huh?
Look at that inflammation!

09:44.983 --> 09:47.451
Get that ugly tongue
away from me!
Oh, yeah?

09:47.519 --> 09:49.620
Feel those
swollen glands there.
Get out of here!

09:49.688 --> 09:52.323
I don't wanna feel
no part of you.
Why?

09:52.391 --> 09:55.593
You're afraid you'll find out
that I'm really sicker than you?

09:55.661 --> 09:58.596
You're sicker than me?
Did you hear that, Edith?
Yes!

09:58.664 --> 10:01.299
He said-- Edith, get me
the other thermometer,
right now.

10:01.366 --> 10:05.069
<i>We'll find out</i>
<i>who's the sickest here.</i>
<i>Fine.</i>

10:05.136 --> 10:08.306
Yeah, all right.
Take that out and
shake it down all the way.

10:08.373 --> 10:11.975
All right.
You shake yours down.
This one's already shook down.

10:12.043 --> 10:15.379
Now, stick that
in your yap and clam up.

10:15.447 --> 10:18.916
I'll time it.
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi,

10:18.983 --> 10:21.419
three Mississippi,
four Mississippi--

10:21.486 --> 10:24.689
- what are you doin', ma?
- I'm countin' 60 seconds.

10:24.756 --> 10:27.425
That's they way
they taught us in school.

10:27.492 --> 10:30.728
Oh, my.
What Mississippi
was I up to?

10:30.795 --> 10:33.598
[ Mumbling ]
You got to four Mississippi.
What did you say, Archie?

10:33.665 --> 10:36.200
Five Mississippi,
six Mississippi--
oh, yeah.

10:36.268 --> 10:39.136
Four Mississippi,
five Mississippi--
you're going back!

10:39.204 --> 10:41.439
Ma, you lost count.
You're way behind.

10:41.506 --> 10:44.041
I know.
I'll time it by
"the minute waltz."

10:44.109 --> 10:47.545
- ¶ [ Humming ]
- Oh, will you shut up!

10:51.717 --> 10:53.851
Next time you wanna
time somethin', Edith,

10:53.918 --> 10:56.554
just let the sand
run out of your head.

11:00.425 --> 11:03.594
That's it. Time's up.
What've you got?

11:03.662 --> 11:05.663
Oh, no.
No, no.

11:05.731 --> 11:08.666
I'm callin' you.
What do you got?

11:08.734 --> 11:11.001
Can you beat 99?

11:11.069 --> 11:13.271
Can I beat 99?

11:13.338 --> 11:16.374
I can beat 99
with points to spare.
What does that say, Edith?

11:16.441 --> 11:19.943
Mckesson and Roberts--
aw, give me that!

11:24.483 --> 11:28.653
Can I beat 99?
What do you say to 99.3?

11:28.720 --> 11:31.889
Read it and weep.
101.2.

11:31.956 --> 11:35.159
Let me see that.
All right.
There it is-- 101.2.

11:35.226 --> 11:38.362
Yeah, we found out
who's really sick around here.
[ Chuckles ]

11:38.430 --> 11:41.165
What am I happy about?
I'm dying.

11:41.232 --> 11:43.200
Gloria, get up.
Let me lie down on the couch.

11:43.268 --> 11:46.170
Oh, no, you don't.
My temperature's 101.

11:46.237 --> 11:48.238
And for two tenths of a point,
you're not taking my couch.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.374
Gloria, I am sick!
Will you let me
lie down on the couch?

11:50.442 --> 11:52.543
Aw, dummy up,
the two of youse, will ya?

11:52.611 --> 11:54.978
Hypochondriac!
Hypochondriac, huh?

11:55.046 --> 11:57.715
I got a 101.2!
That ain't hypochondriac!

11:57.783 --> 12:01.185
<i>[ Doorbell ringing ]</i>
<i>Edith, the doorbell</i>
<i>is ringing!</i>

12:01.252 --> 12:03.721
<i>[ Yelling continues ]</i>

12:03.789 --> 12:06.624
Edith, the doorbell--
ah, what's the use!

12:06.692 --> 12:08.626
[ Mike ]
That's it! I'm gettin' hotter!
I'm gettin' worse!

12:08.694 --> 12:12.663
Shut up, all of ya!
Shhhh!
[ Arguing stops ]

12:15.033 --> 12:17.201
There's a person
at the door.

12:20.405 --> 12:23.974
- Maude!
- Edith!

12:24.042 --> 12:29.179
Wait a minute! Didn't you get
my telegram telling you to
stay the hell away from here?

12:29.247 --> 12:31.716
Of course
I got your telegram...

12:31.783 --> 12:35.085
Telling me to stay
the hell away from here.

12:35.153 --> 12:39.724
Edith, honey!
You can rest easy now.

12:39.791 --> 12:42.326
Maudie is here.

12:43.662 --> 12:45.596
Aw, geez.

12:49.868 --> 12:54.905
Okay, everybody.
Rise and shine.
Time to get up.

12:54.973 --> 12:58.208
¶ Lazy Mary, will you get up
will you get up
will you get up ¶

12:58.276 --> 13:02.613
come on, everybody!
Edith!

13:02.681 --> 13:06.584
Mike, Gloria, everybody,
we're gonna have breakfast
downstairs together.

13:06.651 --> 13:09.553
The exercise'll
do you good.

13:09.621 --> 13:12.590
¶ Good morning
good morning ¶

13:12.657 --> 13:15.426
¶ you've slept
the whole night through
good morning ¶

13:15.494 --> 13:18.396
¶ good morning to you ¶

13:18.463 --> 13:20.931
are you waiting
for a special invitation?

13:20.999 --> 13:23.233
I said breakfast
is on the table.

13:23.301 --> 13:27.405
I heard ya.
So did every moose
up in Canada.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.511
Listen, Archie,
I'm not going to
let you upset me.

13:33.578 --> 13:35.513
I'm only here
because of Edith.

13:35.580 --> 13:39.750
The fact that
you happen to be here with her
is beyond my control,

13:39.818 --> 13:42.019
like any other
freak of nature.

13:45.089 --> 13:47.425
Now, you can either
come to the table and eat,

13:47.492 --> 13:50.360
or you can lie there
and feed off your own fat.

13:58.503 --> 14:02.005
And if you choose the latter,
you could probably
lie there for months.

14:07.245 --> 14:11.181
I didn't sleep
a whole wink here last night!

14:11.249 --> 14:14.552
It's daytime now,
so get off the couch.
You'll be in the way.

14:14.619 --> 14:17.755
What are you talkin' about?
You're the one
that put me on the couch.

14:17.823 --> 14:21.391
You're the one that wouldn't
let me sleep with my own
wife up there in my own bed.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.226
Your wife needs her rest.

14:23.294 --> 14:27.397
Probably the first
peaceful night's sleep
she's had in 20 years.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.934
Dear, sweet Edith.

14:30.001 --> 14:32.035
I'd kill for that girl.

14:41.613 --> 14:45.850
Geez, maude, you already buried
two husbands. Ain't that
enough killin' for ya?

14:48.052 --> 14:53.156
It's only 8:00 in the morning,
and already that foul mouth
is open for business.

14:55.393 --> 14:58.395
Fred died
of a brain hemorrhage,

14:58.463 --> 15:00.698
and Bert died
of a heart seizure.

15:00.765 --> 15:02.766
And you know that
very well, Archie bunker.

15:02.834 --> 15:04.768
All I know,
I seen the two of them...

15:04.836 --> 15:08.171
Layin' up at the funeral parlor
with big smiles on their faces.

15:12.744 --> 15:14.845
Good morning, everybody.

15:14.913 --> 15:17.681
Here's Edith.
Get up, Archie.
What for?

15:17.749 --> 15:20.183
Oh, look, you got
everything ready.

15:20.251 --> 15:22.285
That's right.
Sit there, Archie.

15:22.353 --> 15:24.622
You know, Bert and Fred--
God rest their souls--

15:24.689 --> 15:27.992
used to jump up
and hold my chair for me.

15:28.059 --> 15:31.795
[ Edith ]
It's a shame they both
had to die so young.

15:31.863 --> 15:34.965
It was all that jumpin' up,
holdin' out chairs.

15:35.033 --> 15:36.967
Watch it, Archie.

15:37.035 --> 15:39.904
[ Blows raspberry ]

15:39.971 --> 15:41.939
You're common.
Here, sweetheart.

15:42.007 --> 15:45.475
You drink your juice,
and I'm gonna make you
a nice hot breakfast.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.912
Oh, my!

15:47.979 --> 15:50.781
I feel so rested.

15:50.849 --> 15:55.452
I bet that's
the first good night's sleep
I've had in 20 years.

15:59.024 --> 16:01.358
How do you feel,
Archie?

16:01.426 --> 16:04.828
How would you feel
if you was woke up by
a singin' storm trooper?

16:06.164 --> 16:08.331
But she's
such a big help,
[ Groans ]

16:08.399 --> 16:10.467
And she means well.

16:10.535 --> 16:13.303
Don't walk so close to me,
will ya?
You're breathin' on me.

16:13.371 --> 16:15.539
Then walk faster,
'cause I'm hungry.

16:15.607 --> 16:18.341
Well, how do you two
feel this morning?

16:18.409 --> 16:22.112
Well, my temperature's
down to 100,
but my throat still feels bad.

16:22.180 --> 16:24.414
My eyes are clearin' up,
but my nasal passage--
who cares, Michael?

16:24.482 --> 16:28.185
Who cares?
Do you know what
he did to me?

16:28.252 --> 16:31.455
He set the alarm to wake
himself up every two hours
all night long...

16:31.522 --> 16:33.457
So that he could gargle
and take his pills...

16:33.524 --> 16:35.459
And wheeze over his inhaler
for ten minutes.

16:35.526 --> 16:39.229
You know something, Michael?
When you're sick,
you're sick!

16:41.399 --> 16:43.834
Good morning, children.
Here, sweetheart.

16:43.902 --> 16:47.671
I made you a lovely breakfast--
bacon and eggs,
toast and potatoes.

16:47.739 --> 16:50.741
Thank you.
And for you,
I made delicious custard.

16:50.809 --> 16:54.511
Oh, thank you.
Good for the tum-tum.
And this is for you.

16:54.579 --> 16:57.114
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

16:57.181 --> 16:59.516
Custard for them?
What the hell
do you call this?

16:59.584 --> 17:03.988
It's my own invention--
cream of wheat with cheese.

17:05.857 --> 17:08.092
Cream of wheat
with cheese?

17:08.159 --> 17:11.294
It's light,
but it binds.

17:21.906 --> 17:24.608
This here looks like
somethin' I ate and lost.

17:26.678 --> 17:30.447
Oh, daddy,
don't be so crude.
<i>[ Maude ] Crude?</i>

17:30.515 --> 17:32.616
He was always crude.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.652
I remember when
he and Edith were courting,

17:34.719 --> 17:36.654
they used to love
to go to the movies.

17:36.721 --> 17:41.025
With a screen full of
Leslie Howards, Spencer Tracys
and Clark gables,

17:41.092 --> 17:44.128
he took her to see
Buster crabbe.

17:44.195 --> 17:46.764
Damn right.
A hell of an actor.

17:46.831 --> 17:49.033
You never knew
what was any good, maude.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.802
You was always wrong
about everything.

17:51.870 --> 17:55.572
The luckiest day
in Edith's life was the day
I took her away from you...

17:55.640 --> 17:58.976
And your whole family
of dreamy-eyed screwballs.

17:59.044 --> 18:02.012
You're not stopping at me.
Now you're attacking
the whole family.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.848
And after that wedding,
those presents we gave you!

18:04.916 --> 18:06.884
Presents?
What presents?

18:06.951 --> 18:09.820
All I remember
Edith bringing with her
was a waffle iron,

18:09.888 --> 18:14.024
a raincoat that leaked,
four cavities and
a compacted wisdom tooth.

18:14.092 --> 18:17.194
Presents.
[ Mock laughter ]

18:17.261 --> 18:20.130

Get out of my way!

18:20.198 --> 18:23.867
Cream of wheat
and cheese, huh?
Wrong again, maude!

18:32.577 --> 18:36.213
Don't mind him, maude.
He ain't himself today.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.916
He wasn't so great
yesterday either.

18:38.983 --> 18:43.220
Well, what can you expect
from a man who used to laugh
out loud at ish kabibble?

18:43.287 --> 18:45.956
What's ish kabibble?

18:46.024 --> 18:49.159
He was a person.
He played in kay kyser's band.

18:49.227 --> 18:51.595
The college
of musical knowledge.

18:51.662 --> 18:55.332
- Was he funny?
- Like a migraine.

18:55.399 --> 19:00.904
But every time kay kyser said,
"and here's ish kabibble,"
your father laughed.

19:00.972 --> 19:03.540
Now, come on, everybody. Let's
all go into the living room.
Leave the dishes.

19:03.608 --> 19:06.243
I'll clean them up later.
Come on, sweetheart.

19:06.310 --> 19:09.446
Now, you sit over here, Edith.
Make yourself comfortable,
honey.

19:09.513 --> 19:14.785
I want you to get
all the rest you need.
Don't worry about me, maude.

19:14.853 --> 19:17.454
You know, this is
the first time I've been
off my feet today.

19:17.521 --> 19:22.559
It really feels good.
Maude, maybe you'd better
not sit in that chair.

19:22.627 --> 19:25.896
Why not?
This old chair
is just perfect for me.

19:25.964 --> 19:29.466
- You see, Archie--
- Archie, Archie.

19:29.533 --> 19:33.570
Oh, Edith, when I think of
the hundreds of men
you could have married.

19:33.638 --> 19:35.572
Who?

19:37.575 --> 19:40.744
Well, there was, uh--
there was Bruce pellet, for one.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.913
He liked you a lot,
Edith.

19:42.981 --> 19:45.849
Bruce pellet.
Bruce--

19:45.917 --> 19:48.919
oh, I remember him.

19:48.987 --> 19:53.223
He was always
pickin' at himself like
his underwear was too tight.

19:55.226 --> 19:58.628
And then one day,
we didn't notice it no more.

19:58.696 --> 20:00.497
Oh, you mean he stopped?

20:00.564 --> 20:03.767
No, he moved out
of the neighborhood.

20:05.837 --> 20:08.138
Hey, hey, hey.

20:08.206 --> 20:10.740
You're in my chair,
maude.

20:10.809 --> 20:13.576
So?
I wanna sit in my chair.

20:13.644 --> 20:17.214
- Oh?
- You gonna get
out of my chair?

20:17.282 --> 20:19.216
No!

20:19.284 --> 20:22.085
Now, maude, if you don't
get out of that chair,

20:22.153 --> 20:24.421
I got a way to make you
very, very upset.

20:24.488 --> 20:27.157
- Archie, please.
- Stay out of this now, Edith.

20:27.225 --> 20:29.293
Come on, maude.
Last chance.
You gonna get out of there?

20:29.360 --> 20:31.461
Get lost.

20:32.530 --> 20:35.065
Ho, ho, ho.

20:35.133 --> 20:38.936
Well, I got the
secret weapon that can lay
this little lady right away.

20:39.003 --> 20:43.340
Here we go.
This country was ruined...

20:43.407 --> 20:46.810
By Franklin
delano Roosevelt!

20:52.383 --> 20:54.318
You're fat.

20:57.621 --> 21:01.658
Sticks and stones
may break my bones, but
Franklin delano Roosevelt--

21:01.726 --> 21:05.695
you promised never
to say that name again
in front of maude.

21:05.763 --> 21:08.598
Franklin delano Roosevelt!
He don't mean nothin'.

21:08.666 --> 21:10.901
His whole family
was for Roosevelt.

21:10.969 --> 21:13.403
That was for two terms,
but that was it!

21:13.471 --> 21:16.273
We didn't know the guy
was gonna hang on
to the job like a pope!

21:16.341 --> 21:20.043
He hung on...
To save the country.

21:20.111 --> 21:24.114
The people adored him.
He was a Saint.
That man had charisma.

21:24.182 --> 21:26.149
I don't care
if he was sick.

21:29.287 --> 21:32.622
He always had
his big mouth open
at them fireside chats.

21:32.690 --> 21:36.293
Those fireside chats
kept this country informed.

21:36.361 --> 21:39.396
And one "my friends"
from Roosevelt...

21:39.463 --> 21:43.466
Was worth a barrel full of
"let me make this
perfectly clears."

21:43.534 --> 21:45.568
Ohh!

21:45.636 --> 21:48.038
Now you're rappin'
my president, huh?

21:48.106 --> 21:51.141
Well, let me tell you
one thing about
Richard e. Nixon.

21:53.511 --> 21:56.746
He knows how to keep
his wife pat home.

21:56.814 --> 21:59.582
Roosevelt could never
do that with Eleanor.

21:59.650 --> 22:02.585
She was always
out on the loose,

22:02.653 --> 22:05.488
runnin' around
with the coloreds,

22:05.556 --> 22:08.292
tellin' 'em they was gettin'
the short end of the stick.

22:08.359 --> 22:10.360
She was the one that
discovered the coloreds
in this country.

22:10.428 --> 22:12.362
We never knew
they was there.

22:15.833 --> 22:19.702
And we've been havin'
nothin' but trouble
with them ever since!

22:19.770 --> 22:22.705
It was a question
of civil rights
or civil war.

22:22.773 --> 22:25.642
We got civil war, maude!
We got riots in the streets!

22:25.709 --> 22:27.644
Because of poverty
and unemployment.

22:27.711 --> 22:32.115
No! Because of
Franklin delano Roosevelt,
the first creepin' socialist.

22:32.183 --> 22:34.484
He brought the country
back from the depression.

22:34.552 --> 22:37.054
And dumped us right into
the middle of world war ii.

22:37.121 --> 22:39.222
Which he won as
our commander in chief.

22:39.290 --> 22:43.060
No! That's a lie!
General macarthur won that war.

22:43.127 --> 22:47.064
And Roosevelt
fired him for it.
That was Truman.

22:47.131 --> 22:50.300
Under secret sealed orders
from f.D.R.

22:52.170 --> 22:55.439
Oh, come on!
That's a fact, maude!

22:55.506 --> 23:00.043
Just like that other fact--
that he sold us out
to Joe Stalin at Gibraltar.

23:00.111 --> 23:04.414
They met at yalta.
He sold us out
there too!

23:04.482 --> 23:07.717
He handed all of Europe
over to the russkies
on a silver platter.

23:07.785 --> 23:11.888
I don't wanna argue
with you no more, maude!
And I got my chair back!

23:21.199 --> 23:23.733
You know, Archie,
I think I liked you better...

23:23.801 --> 23:26.569
When you were shoving straws
up your nose.

23:28.306 --> 23:30.440
I'm leaving this house!

23:30.508 --> 23:34.277
Maude!
Let her go!
I got my chair back.

23:34.345 --> 23:36.779
Archie,
you can have your chair.

23:36.847 --> 23:40.783
Only don't move around
too much.
You'll crush your brains.

23:46.624 --> 23:48.725
Maude--
don't say nothin' to her!
Let her go, Edith!

23:48.792 --> 23:51.294
I don't want her around--
what's the matter with you?
Oh, my.

23:51.362 --> 23:53.663
What's wrong, honey?
Archie,

23:53.731 --> 23:56.699
when you first got sick,
where did it hit you?

23:56.767 --> 23:59.369
Oh, geez, you know
where it hit me.

23:59.437 --> 24:01.371
Mike, where did you feel it?

24:01.439 --> 24:03.206
It was my head.
I got dizzy.

24:03.274 --> 24:07.077
- You, Gloria?
- Suddenly, I felt nauseous
and I started throwing up.

24:07.145 --> 24:10.514
That's the one!
Wait a minute! Edith!
Where are you going?

24:10.581 --> 24:13.016
Edith, what's the matter
with you?
I'm sick!

24:13.084 --> 24:16.119
Edith, you can't be sick!
What's gonna happen to us?

24:16.187 --> 24:18.588
Who the hell's
gonna take care of us?

24:24.662 --> 24:26.863
Maudie's here.

24:39.077 --> 24:41.178
Aw, geez.

24:41.245 --> 24:43.180
In sickness and in health.

24:44.549 --> 24:48.618
Oh, boy.
What are youse tryin' to do,

24:48.686 --> 24:51.854
give your germs
a new lease on life?

24:51.922 --> 24:55.692
Come on, daddy. Don't be
so grumpy. You should be
happy we're feeling better.

24:55.759 --> 24:58.995
How can I be happy...
With that woman up there?

24:59.063 --> 25:01.531
Hangin' around my neck
like an albatross.

25:03.601 --> 25:06.603
Archie, you have to have
patience. That's the way
it is with the flu.

25:06.670 --> 25:09.506
Sometimes it lasts
a couple of days, sometimes
you can be sick for a week.

25:09.574 --> 25:11.941
God, work a miracle today,
will ya?

25:12.009 --> 25:15.945
[ Maude ]
Are you sure you can manage?
[ Edith ] I'm fine, maude, now.

25:16.013 --> 25:18.515
Here, look, Archie.
Look who's up.

25:36.267 --> 25:40.370
