00:22.439 --> 00:24.974
See you later!

00:24.976 --> 00:26.945
Come on, guys.
Leave him alone.

00:36.488 --> 00:37.988
<i>Hello?</i>

01:06.417 --> 01:07.753
Boy.

01:13.289 --> 01:15.256
Wow. That was amazing.

01:15.258 --> 01:17.595
Why don't you play outside
with your friends?

01:18.596 --> 01:20.430
I don't know.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.671
Come here.

01:28.673 --> 01:29.939
You don't know, huh?

01:29.941 --> 01:31.674
Sometimes they make fun of me.

01:31.676 --> 01:33.177
Hmm.

01:36.581 --> 01:38.180
Is that real?

01:38.182 --> 01:39.280
Yes.

01:39.282 --> 01:42.385
It's real.
Everything here is real.

01:42.387 --> 01:44.920
Whoa. Is that real?

01:47.691 --> 01:50.024
That cat is real.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.559
Real monster.

01:58.470 --> 01:59.771
What's that?

02:00.238 --> 02:01.704
This?

02:01.706 --> 02:03.508
This is Lloyd.

02:08.179 --> 02:10.713
Hmm.

02:10.715 --> 02:14.416
He looks like
a very brave fighter.

02:14.418 --> 02:16.851
No, he's just a kid.

02:16.853 --> 02:18.921
He can't do anything.

02:18.923 --> 02:22.027
He might look different, but...

02:24.496 --> 02:26.998
But he can do great things.

02:29.033 --> 02:30.034
Whoa.

02:32.403 --> 02:34.303
You just have to look at it,

02:34.305 --> 02:36.874
from a different
point of view.

02:46.550 --> 02:48.119
Whoa!

02:50.420 --> 02:52.022
This is his teacher.

02:52.958 --> 02:54.492
Very old,

02:54.992 --> 02:56.357
very wise

02:56.360 --> 02:57.894
and very handsome.

03:00.365 --> 03:06.067
Have you ever heard the legend
behind the legend of NINJAGO?

03:06.069 --> 03:07.435
No.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.704
I will tell you.

03:08.706 --> 03:12.240
But to truly see it,
you must forget

03:12.242 --> 03:14.277
everything you know.

03:16.247 --> 03:18.949
And see things in a new way.

03:22.453 --> 03:24.852
The story of NINJAGO

03:24.854 --> 03:27.389
is the story of a boy.

03:27.391 --> 03:29.290
His name is Lloyd.

03:29.293 --> 03:34.032
And his dad is the worst guy
in the history of the world.

03:35.931 --> 03:39.067
<i>Today on</i>
Good Morning NINJAGO...

03:39.069 --> 03:40.335
<i>Buenos d√≠as,</i> NINJAGO!

03:41.639 --> 03:42.839
G'day, NINJAGO!

03:42.841 --> 03:43.839
<i>Guten Morgen,</i>
NINJAGO.

03:43.841 --> 03:45.009
<i>Bonjour,</i> NINJAGO.

03:46.176 --> 03:47.609
<i>When Garmadon attacks...</i>

03:49.280 --> 03:50.678
<i>...we are there!</i>

03:50.681 --> 03:53.516
<i>When Garmadon crashes
the stock market,</i>

03:53.518 --> 03:54.883
<i>we're there again!</i>

03:54.885 --> 03:57.653
<i>When Garmadon defaces</i>
Whistler's Mother,

03:57.655 --> 03:59.056
<i>we're still there!</i>

03:59.958 --> 04:01.923
<i>We are the only news team</i>

04:01.925 --> 04:03.726
<i>watching Garmadon's
volcanic lair</i>

04:03.728 --> 04:05.326
<i>24 hours a day.</i>

04:05.329 --> 04:08.898
- <i>This is...</i>
- Good Morning, NINJAGO!

04:08.900 --> 04:11.867
- I'm Robin Roberts.
- And I'm Michael Strahan.

04:11.869 --> 04:14.869
And I am pumped
to be bringing you the news.

04:14.871 --> 04:16.738
<i>- Pumped!</i>
- Whoo!

04:16.740 --> 04:19.809
Well, looks like everyone
is on pins and needles

04:19.810 --> 04:21.910
waiting for
Garmadon's next attack.

04:21.911 --> 04:23.710
<i>Attack forecast!</i>

04:23.713 --> 04:25.114
Our experts predict

04:25.116 --> 04:28.850
a 95% chance
of a Garmadon attack today.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.419
Yikes! NINJAGO,
you better stay inside.

04:31.421 --> 04:33.823
You better stay right there.
Don't you dare come out!

04:33.825 --> 04:36.792
<i>At least until our
Secret Ninja Force steps in.</i>

04:36.794 --> 04:38.427
Thank goodness
for those Ninjas.

04:38.429 --> 04:40.628
<i>But who are these
Secret Ninjas, Robin?</i>

04:40.631 --> 04:41.996
<i>We have
so many questions.</i>

04:41.999 --> 04:44.068
<i>Burning questions!</i>

04:44.901 --> 04:46.335
<i>Fire Ninja.</i>

04:46.337 --> 04:48.938
<i>Where is he on a scale of
one to awesome?</i>

04:48.940 --> 04:50.306
I'm not gonna lie.

04:50.308 --> 04:52.574
I'm awesome!

04:52.576 --> 04:53.843
<i>Earth Ninja.</i>

04:53.845 --> 04:55.778
<i>When will he upgrade
to digital?</i>

04:55.780 --> 04:57.015
No, I would never do that.

04:58.515 --> 04:59.647
<i>Ice Ninja.</i>

04:59.650 --> 05:02.218
<i>Is he a real boy or a robot?</i>

05:02.220 --> 05:04.987
<i>How dare you. I'm a wild teen.</i>

05:04.989 --> 05:06.222
<i>Lightning Ninja.</i>

05:06.224 --> 05:08.556
<i>Is he the bravest ninja
of them all?</i>

05:09.826 --> 05:12.160
<i>I'll take that as a yes.</i>

05:12.162 --> 05:13.595
<i>Water Ninja.</i>

05:13.597 --> 05:16.097
<i>She's a girl and a ninja!
Can she really have it all?</i>

05:16.099 --> 05:19.802
You fellas
need to inform yourselves

05:19.804 --> 05:21.235
of where we're at culturally.

05:21.237 --> 05:24.008
<i>And finally the Green Ninja.</i>

05:24.975 --> 05:26.641
<i>He fights in the air,</i>

05:26.643 --> 05:28.009
<i>on the ground,</i>

05:28.011 --> 05:30.778
<i>and in the kitchen
with a refrigerator.</i>

05:30.780 --> 05:32.814
<i>But what is he hiding?</i>

05:32.816 --> 05:34.616
<i>And who is he really?</i>

05:34.618 --> 05:36.018
<i>Local birthdays!</i>

05:36.020 --> 05:37.886
Celebrating birthdays today

05:37.888 --> 05:40.189
<i>are this hot dog guy,
this panda</i>

05:40.191 --> 05:41.422
and, uh-oh...

05:41.424 --> 05:43.224
<i>Lloyd Garmadon.</i>

05:43.226 --> 05:45.794
The son of
the evil Lord Garmadon.

05:48.998 --> 05:51.102
<i>Must be tough
to be that kid.</i>

06:03.681 --> 06:04.746
Hello?

06:07.751 --> 06:08.953
<i>Hello.</i>

06:09.919 --> 06:11.254
<i>What do you want?</i>

06:12.320 --> 06:15.356
- Uh... You called me.
- <i>Hang on a second.</i>

06:15.359 --> 06:18.460
<i>Mm. I must have
butt dialed you. Who is this?</i>

06:18.462 --> 06:21.063
It's Lloyd.

06:21.065 --> 06:24.232
- Lloyd Garmadon, your son.
- <i>No.</i>

06:24.234 --> 06:27.169
<i>My son is totally bald
and has no teeth.</i>

06:27.171 --> 06:30.239
Yeah, well, surprise.
I'm not a baby anymore.

06:30.241 --> 06:31.371
<i>Duly noted.</i>

06:31.374 --> 06:32.874
<i>How old are you?
You're seven, right?</i>

06:32.876 --> 06:34.676
- <i>You're seven? Huh.</i>
- Sixteen.

06:34.678 --> 06:36.078
Just add nine to that.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.277
- <i>Well, good talk, son.</i>
- Wait.

06:37.279 --> 06:39.847
Are you sure there isn't
a special reason

06:39.849 --> 06:42.218
why you might have
called me today?

06:42.220 --> 06:43.085
On this day.

06:43.087 --> 06:45.420
Specifically today.

06:45.422 --> 06:48.891
<i>Look, I didn't call you.
My butt called you.</i>

06:48.893 --> 06:50.558
Oh.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.494
<i>Well, no time to chat. Sorry,
Daddy's got to go to work.</i>

06:52.496 --> 06:54.196
- <i>Gotta get that Green Ninja.</i>
- Yeah.

06:54.198 --> 06:56.232
<i>Glad the teeth
finally came in. Bye-bye.</i>

06:57.933 --> 07:01.136
Lloyd! Good morning!

07:01.138 --> 07:05.006
Mom, hey,
um, here's a thought.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.977
What if I didn't go
to school today?

07:07.979 --> 07:09.278
What? Oh, no!

07:09.280 --> 07:10.879
You don't want to
miss school, honey.

07:10.881 --> 07:12.513
These are the best years
of your life.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.984
Um, have you...
Have you been to high school?

07:15.986 --> 07:17.619
'Cause, uh...

07:17.621 --> 07:19.821
It's judgey. Pretty judgey.

07:19.823 --> 07:21.422
Oh, honey.

07:21.424 --> 07:23.492
You just need to give them
a chance to see the real you.

07:23.494 --> 07:24.794
Yeah, I don't think

07:24.796 --> 07:28.229
I can actually show people
the real me.

07:28.231 --> 07:29.330
That's not true.

07:29.333 --> 07:30.866
All you've got to do
is just show them

07:30.868 --> 07:33.402
the person you are
on the inside.

07:33.404 --> 07:34.636
Right here.

07:34.638 --> 07:36.571
Where it matters most.

07:36.573 --> 07:37.972
Oh, and also don't forget,

07:37.975 --> 07:39.809
if your dad attacks
the city again today,

07:39.811 --> 07:41.210
just be sure to...

07:41.212 --> 07:42.477
Duck and cover
until the Secret Ninjas

07:42.479 --> 07:43.545
give the all clear.

07:43.547 --> 07:46.247
- Oh, and also, don't forget,
- LLOYD: Yeah?

07:46.249 --> 07:48.451
Have a happy birthday, honey.

07:48.453 --> 07:49.652
Thanks, Mom.

07:49.654 --> 07:50.852
I'll try my best.

07:50.854 --> 07:52.253
Of course you will!

07:53.857 --> 07:55.657
Hello!

08:04.034 --> 08:06.302
Shh.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.276
Hey.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.316
Cool.

08:42.873 --> 08:44.640
Shh.

08:48.513 --> 08:50.544
That's the kid
I was telling you about.

08:50.546 --> 08:52.316
His dad ruins everything.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.617
Hello, fellow teenager!

08:55.619 --> 08:57.151
Zane, hey!

08:57.153 --> 09:00.088
Man, my mom is on my case
all the time. She's all...

09:04.128 --> 09:06.428
And I'm like, "Lay off, Mom.
I'm just a teenager."

09:06.430 --> 09:08.463
I hear that.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.531
Bro!

09:09.533 --> 09:10.899
Dude, gimme a hug, man!

09:10.901 --> 09:12.900
- Gimme a birthday hug.
- Kai.

09:12.902 --> 09:14.769
- That's a good one.
- Birthday hug?

09:14.771 --> 09:16.103
Let me get in on that.

09:16.105 --> 09:18.006
I'll increase
the pressure dramatically.

09:18.008 --> 09:19.328
Zane, Zane, Zane...

09:20.243 --> 09:22.044
Watch out!

09:22.046 --> 09:24.245
- Lloyd!
<i>- Nya!</i>

09:24.247 --> 09:25.847
- Yo, bro.
- What's up, sis?

09:25.849 --> 09:27.116
Oh, hey, actual bro.

09:27.118 --> 09:29.083
Hey, Nya!
Where'd you get that bike?

09:29.085 --> 09:32.253
At the great
stuff store? Uh...

09:32.255 --> 09:34.924
Guys, check out
my new paint job,

09:34.926 --> 09:36.891
'cause I did it myself!

09:36.893 --> 09:39.660
The Lady Iron Dragon.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.995
My hero!

09:40.998 --> 09:42.264
<i>Hey, everyone, look!</i>

09:42.267 --> 09:45.265
It's Garma-dork
and the dork squad!

09:45.267 --> 09:46.800
You wanna hear our new cheer?

09:46.802 --> 09:49.671
L-L-O-Y-D.
His dad is bad and so is he.

09:49.673 --> 09:50.905
Boo, Lloyd!

09:50.907 --> 09:52.005
Boo, Lloyd!

09:52.008 --> 09:53.575
Boo, Lloyd!

09:53.577 --> 09:54.843
Great chant!

09:54.845 --> 09:57.545
I'll bet you got a number one
hit on your hands.

09:57.547 --> 10:00.548
<i>And straight in
at number one with a bullet.</i>

10:00.550 --> 10:02.584
<i>It's</i> Boo, Lloyd.

10:02.586 --> 10:04.853
Hey, ladies.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.255
<i>L-L-O-Y-D.</i>

10:06.257 --> 10:07.856
<i>His dad is bad and so is he.</i>

10:07.858 --> 10:09.491
<i>Boo, Lloyd!</i>

10:09.493 --> 10:11.160
<i>Boo, Lloyd!</i>

10:11.162 --> 10:12.927
<i>Boo...</i>

10:35.018 --> 10:37.352
<i>Citizens of NINJAGO!</i>

10:37.354 --> 10:39.987
<i>Get ready</i>

10:39.989 --> 10:43.323
<i>to welcome your new overlord!</i>

10:43.325 --> 10:46.794
<i>Who goes by the name of...</i>

10:46.796 --> 10:48.197
Garmadon!

10:48.199 --> 10:49.631
<i>What's my name?</i>

10:49.633 --> 10:50.965
Garmadon!

10:50.968 --> 10:52.568
Say it again!

10:52.570 --> 10:53.635
Garmadon!

10:53.637 --> 10:55.136
I can't hear you!

10:55.138 --> 10:56.905
- Garmadon!
- Garmadon!

10:56.907 --> 10:58.274
<i>Don't wear it out!</i>

10:58.276 --> 10:59.641
<i>Okay, General Number Six.</i>

10:59.643 --> 11:00.675
Yes, sir.

11:00.677 --> 11:02.276
<i>You and your team
of crab men</i>

11:02.278 --> 11:04.158
- <i>overthrow the police station.</i>
- I can do that.

11:06.016 --> 11:07.281
General Number One,

11:07.283 --> 11:09.049
- <i>take the TV station.</i>
- 10-4!

11:09.051 --> 11:10.251
What?

11:10.253 --> 11:11.486
<i>General Number Five,</i>

11:11.488 --> 11:13.322
- <i>crash the stock market.</i>
- Okey-doke.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.522
<i>General Number Three,</i>

11:14.524 --> 11:16.357
<i>knock over that table.</i>

11:16.360 --> 11:18.093
<i>General Number Two,
pop that kid's balloon.</i>

11:19.196 --> 11:20.596
<i>General Number Four,</i>

11:20.598 --> 11:22.097
<i>make the school bus
dangle precariously</i>

11:22.099 --> 11:23.198
<i>over an overpass or something.</i>

11:23.200 --> 11:24.435
<i>I've never seen that before!</i>

11:29.638 --> 11:30.638
We're gonna die!

11:30.641 --> 11:31.939
Now,
all I have to do is climb

11:31.941 --> 11:33.242
<i>to the top of NINJAGO Tower,</i>

11:33.244 --> 11:35.044
<i>and then I will rule
over NINJAGO.</i>

11:35.046 --> 11:36.544
Wait. What?

11:36.546 --> 11:40.750
I said I will rule
over NINJAGO, forever!

11:42.719 --> 11:44.651
Where are the ninjas?

11:47.624 --> 11:49.391
- MS.
- Uh-oh.

11:49.393 --> 11:50.924
It's Garmadon!

11:50.926 --> 11:52.461
Thanks, Lloyd.

11:52.463 --> 11:54.496
You know what
to do. Duck and cover!

11:54.498 --> 11:55.996
Can I have
a bathroom pass?

11:55.998 --> 11:58.266
I think you mean, "May I."

11:58.268 --> 12:01.337
"May I have a bathroom pass?"

12:01.339 --> 12:02.739
You know what?
Do whatever you want.

12:03.907 --> 12:04.972
Come on, come on!

12:09.945 --> 12:11.615
Ninja, go!

12:17.321 --> 12:19.253
<i>Ninja computer
system initiated.</i>

12:19.255 --> 12:20.457
Come on!

12:21.325 --> 12:22.757
Ninja team,

12:22.759 --> 12:24.126
shout out your call signs.

12:24.128 --> 12:25.926
- Ha-ha!
- Kai, light it up!

12:25.928 --> 12:27.496
Whoo! Fire mech!

12:27.498 --> 12:28.564
So ninja!

12:28.566 --> 12:29.798
<i>Fire mech ignited.</i>

12:29.800 --> 12:30.833
All right,
take it away, sis!

12:30.835 --> 12:32.467
Water mech.

12:32.469 --> 12:34.102
Ready and standing by.

12:34.104 --> 12:35.469
- Zane!
- Come on!

12:35.471 --> 12:37.205
- Your turn, buddy!
- Ice mech.

12:37.207 --> 12:40.041
<i>Loading. Loading. Loading...</i>

12:40.043 --> 12:41.476
Ready, Jay?

12:41.478 --> 12:43.578
Yeah, yeah, I got this.
Lightning mech, ready.

12:43.580 --> 12:45.647
Wait! No, not ready. Ready.

12:45.649 --> 12:47.182
<i>Cole, do you wanna kick
Garmadon's butt?</i>

12:47.184 --> 12:48.717
Earth mech.

12:48.719 --> 12:50.486
<i>Turntables
at 33 and a third RPM.</i>

12:50.488 --> 12:52.255
Ready and standing by.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.421
Green Ninja.

12:54.423 --> 12:56.024
Ready and standing by.

12:59.095 --> 13:00.730
All ninjas, hit it!

13:06.970 --> 13:08.536
All right, ninjas, follow me!

13:08.538 --> 13:10.338
As long as we have
these mechs,

13:10.340 --> 13:11.506
<i>we're unstoppable!</i>

13:11.508 --> 13:12.775
If we were the Beatles,

13:12.777 --> 13:14.342
you would be John,
you would be Paul,

13:14.344 --> 13:15.477
you would be George

13:15.479 --> 13:17.215
and I would be their computer.

13:21.085 --> 13:22.586
Run!

13:23.454 --> 13:24.620
Everybody, run!

13:24.622 --> 13:26.019
Get away from the docks!

13:26.022 --> 13:27.222
We're all gonna die!

13:27.224 --> 13:28.459
We're all gonna die!

13:29.225 --> 13:31.193
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

13:31.195 --> 13:32.327
Ninjas!

13:32.329 --> 13:33.862
There they are. Ninjas.

13:33.864 --> 13:35.363
Go, Ninjas! Go!

13:35.365 --> 13:36.964
Thank you for coming
to help us, Ninjas!

13:41.138 --> 13:43.137
We love you,
Green Ninja!

13:43.139 --> 13:44.805
Jay, you take the air.

13:44.807 --> 13:46.275
10-4, good buddy.

13:46.277 --> 13:47.775
Nya, water.

13:47.777 --> 13:50.245
It's a dangerous
and fascinating environment.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.913
I know, right?

13:51.915 --> 13:55.851
Kai, Zane, and Cole,
you guys take downtown.

13:55.853 --> 13:58.120
Already here, dude.

13:58.122 --> 13:59.757
Taking some heavy fire.

14:01.992 --> 14:03.257
Hold on, Kai.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.992
I got you covered.

14:04.994 --> 14:06.227
Have you heard
my latest track?

14:06.229 --> 14:08.197
It's a smash.

14:08.199 --> 14:09.433
Thanks, Cole.

14:10.801 --> 14:12.600
Jay, you've got bogeys
on your six.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.102
<i>You've also
got them on your three,</i>

14:14.104 --> 14:15.169
<i>one, seven, five,</i>

14:15.171 --> 14:17.772
<i>six, eight, nine, and two.</i>

14:17.774 --> 14:19.072
I've got good tone.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.975
Firing.

14:20.978 --> 14:22.410
Too close for missiles.

14:22.412 --> 14:23.812
Switching to crabs!

14:23.814 --> 14:26.180
Crab! Crab! Crab!
Crab! Crab! Crab!

14:26.182 --> 14:27.781
Oh, crabs! Crabs!

14:27.783 --> 14:31.718
Get your affairs
in order, Lightning Ninja.

14:31.721 --> 14:34.323
Ah! I gotta charge up
my supersonic dynamo.

14:34.325 --> 14:36.158
Come on, charge!

14:36.160 --> 14:37.391
Charge!

14:37.393 --> 14:39.060
Hurry up!
Charge, charge, charge!

14:39.062 --> 14:40.663
Charge! Hurry up!
Charge, charge!

14:40.665 --> 14:41.665
Clear!

14:47.037 --> 14:48.372
Whoo-hoo!

14:53.009 --> 14:54.778
Whoo! Bam!

14:58.248 --> 14:59.615
Zane, you are the man!

14:59.617 --> 15:02.416
Yes. I'm a normal
human teenager.

15:02.418 --> 15:03.550
Nice work, guys.

15:03.552 --> 15:05.687
I'm going after Garmadon.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.325
Somebody help us!

15:10.327 --> 15:12.495
Classmates, hold on.

15:17.066 --> 15:18.768
Roar!

15:22.772 --> 15:23.838
Oh, no!

15:27.845 --> 15:29.444
N-I-N-J-A!

15:29.446 --> 15:33.247
N-I-N-J-A! Ninjas!

15:34.652 --> 15:36.919
Thank you, Green Ninja!

15:36.921 --> 15:38.553
You're our hero!

15:38.555 --> 15:40.321
I wanna be him
when I grow up!

15:40.324 --> 15:42.891
Hey, Lloyd, your dad...
I mean, uh...

15:42.893 --> 15:45.126
Garmadon's almost
at the mayor's office!

15:45.128 --> 15:46.761
I'm on it.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.265
We've got you surrounded,
Garmadon.

15:50.267 --> 15:52.165
<i>You're too slow, Green Ninja.</i>

15:52.167 --> 15:53.300
<i>You can't catch me.</i>

15:53.302 --> 15:55.904
<i>Where am I?
Am I over here?</i>

15:55.906 --> 15:56.938
<i>Or am I over there?</i>

15:56.940 --> 15:59.006
You are right behind
that building.

15:59.008 --> 16:00.842
<i>I can see your shark tail
sticking out.</i>

16:00.844 --> 16:02.976
<i>Oh, let me grab that.</i>

16:02.978 --> 16:04.313
<i>Where's Garmadon now?</i>

16:04.315 --> 16:05.746
Am I over here, here, here?

16:05.748 --> 16:07.315
Or am I over there,
there, there, there?

16:07.317 --> 16:08.916
It's like a house of mirrors
in here.

16:08.918 --> 16:10.584
Do you think
you're hiding right now?

16:10.586 --> 16:12.286
Do you actually think
I can't see you?

16:12.288 --> 16:14.588
<i>Well, if you can see me,
why don't you shoot me?</i>

16:14.590 --> 16:16.558
<i>Ow! That was, like,
in my kidney!</i>

16:16.560 --> 16:19.862
Why do you want to conquer
NINJAGO so badly?

16:19.864 --> 16:24.301
Because there's something
very, very special here.

16:25.002 --> 16:26.068
What?

16:26.070 --> 16:27.366
I'm gonna let the walls down

16:27.368 --> 16:29.036
for just a second,
Green Ninja.

16:29.038 --> 16:30.270
Go... Go on.

16:30.272 --> 16:32.073
About 16 years ago,

16:32.075 --> 16:34.675
I lost something
I should have never given up.

16:34.677 --> 16:36.243
What is it? Just say it.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.312
It's okay, you can say it.

16:37.314 --> 16:39.013
I had this guitar in college,

16:39.016 --> 16:42.049
and I traded it stupidly for,
like, a jacket or something.

16:42.051 --> 16:43.649
That's what you were
referring to?

16:43.651 --> 16:44.919
Yeah. What else would I be
referring to?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.054
I don't know.
Maybe something else.

16:47.056 --> 16:48.289
- Think about it.
- What? No!

16:48.292 --> 16:49.958
Are you sure
there's not any other

16:49.960 --> 16:52.361
sort of connection
you have to the city?

16:52.363 --> 16:53.694
- Nothing?
- There is someone

16:53.696 --> 16:55.429
in the city I love very much.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.799
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:56.801 --> 16:58.700
I remember when I first
laid eyes on him.

16:58.702 --> 16:59.867
Go on.

16:59.869 --> 17:02.270
The last time
I saw him was, uh,

17:02.272 --> 17:04.138
I guess about
16 years ago, too.

17:04.141 --> 17:05.439
Yeah?

17:05.441 --> 17:08.443
I was just
an irresponsible kid and...

17:08.444 --> 17:09.877
Uh-huh.

17:09.878 --> 17:11.377
There was this

17:11.380 --> 17:13.311
guy who made,
probably, the best sushi

17:13.314 --> 17:14.616
I've ever had in my life.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.148
You never knew
what was coming next.

17:16.151 --> 17:17.415
And you didn't even order.
It was one of those places

17:17.419 --> 17:18.286
where you don't
even get a menu.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.354
Omakase.

17:19.356 --> 17:20.820
Is that the name of the place?

17:20.823 --> 17:22.124
No, that just means
he brings it to you...

17:22.126 --> 17:23.723
That is!
That's the name of the place.

17:23.726 --> 17:24.858
...and you don't
choose, he chooses.

17:24.859 --> 17:25.726
- That's the place.
- Omakase.

17:25.728 --> 17:27.327
Anyway, just to clarify,

17:27.329 --> 17:28.629
nothing, nothing else, if you
really racked your brain,

17:28.631 --> 17:30.432
there's no other connection?

17:30.434 --> 17:33.267
Yes. There was a boy

17:33.269 --> 17:34.569
that I had in my life.

17:34.571 --> 17:36.805
What happened to your child?

17:36.807 --> 17:39.339
He was bald, had no teeth,
couldn't chew,

17:39.342 --> 17:41.108
always crying, couldn't walk.

17:41.110 --> 17:42.609
Couldn't even walk.
I mean, I was like,

17:42.611 --> 17:44.045
"What are we gonna do
with this kid?"

17:44.047 --> 17:45.680
I'm like, "I don't want
a hairless, crying son

17:45.682 --> 17:47.415
"for the rest of my life."

17:47.417 --> 17:48.883
- Zip it! Zip! No!
- And that was when

17:48.885 --> 17:50.418
I made the decision
to go away and live my life.

17:50.420 --> 17:52.053
Stop talking!
You're done!

17:52.055 --> 17:54.122
<i>Mega missile
mode. Right claw missile.</i>

17:54.124 --> 17:55.222
<i>Left claw missile.</i>

17:55.224 --> 17:56.290
<i>Feet bombs.</i>

17:56.292 --> 17:57.892
<i>Tongue rocket. Spine missile</i>

17:57.894 --> 17:59.126
<i>one, two, three, four.
Tail rocket, one, two...</i>

17:59.128 --> 18:00.796
<i>Eye missile.
Other eye missile.</i>

18:00.798 --> 18:02.463
<i>Toenail missile. Wrist rocket.</i>

18:02.465 --> 18:03.697
<i>Head missile.
Other head missile.</i>

18:03.699 --> 18:05.032
<i>Backup head missile.</i>

18:05.034 --> 18:06.100
<i>Metacarpal missile.</i>

18:06.102 --> 18:07.737
<i>Butt torpedoes.</i>

18:19.882 --> 18:22.517
Oh. Phew.
Just one day till retirement.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.630
Jeez, where did
that come from?

18:35.632 --> 18:37.632
I did not see that coming.

18:37.634 --> 18:40.134
Your missiles are very
accurate, Green Ninja.

18:40.136 --> 18:43.937
Too bad for you,
I upgraded all of my shields!

18:43.939 --> 18:45.374
That's all I seem to have
at the moment,

18:45.376 --> 18:46.473
just some upgraded shields.

18:46.475 --> 18:47.842
<i>Face it, Garmadon.</i>

18:47.844 --> 18:50.243
You will never
take over NINJAGO,

18:50.245 --> 18:53.181
so why don't you just give up
and go away for good?

18:53.183 --> 18:55.450
Well, anything's open
for discussion.

18:55.452 --> 18:57.385
Oh, yeah, except that.

18:57.387 --> 18:58.485
Shields down!

18:58.487 --> 18:59.722
Here, catch! Shields up!

19:02.892 --> 19:03.893
No!

19:06.330 --> 19:07.761
Did you see that?

19:07.763 --> 19:09.263
Oh, yeah, we saw it.

19:09.265 --> 19:11.199
I mean, who taught
you how to catch, man?

19:12.302 --> 19:13.835
Nice catch, loser!

19:13.837 --> 19:16.003
Oh, yeah? Well, take this!

19:19.975 --> 19:22.644
That's amazing!
Who taught you how to throw?

19:22.646 --> 19:23.712
It's funny you ask.

19:23.714 --> 19:25.312
Um, no one, because I, uh...

19:25.314 --> 19:27.482
I never had a dad
to play catch with me.

19:27.484 --> 19:28.683
Well, it shows.

19:28.685 --> 19:29.715
'Cause that was
the worst thing

19:29.718 --> 19:31.152
I've ever seen in my life.

19:31.154 --> 19:33.020
Or, uh, you know,
teach me how to ride a bike,

19:33.022 --> 19:35.155
or shave...

19:35.157 --> 19:37.157
Or how to defuse a bomb!

19:37.159 --> 19:38.259
You know what's funny?

19:38.261 --> 19:40.194
Is I know how to do
all those things.

19:40.196 --> 19:41.261
- Do you?
- Yeah.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.597
Oh, good to know.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.832
And they're just sitting
there, idle in my brain.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.768
Just wasted. Floating away.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.936
- Never taught them to anybody.
- Mm-hmm.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.538
And they'll
probably die with me.

19:50.540 --> 19:51.839
Really?

19:51.841 --> 19:53.441
When I die, if I die.

19:53.443 --> 19:56.108
- Just leave NINJAGO already...
- Which will never happen.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.611
- ...please!
- I will never die.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.414
- And get out of my life!
- Ever. Ever.

19:59.416 --> 20:00.681
I...

20:00.683 --> 20:03.117
Get out of your life?

20:03.119 --> 20:05.186
Weirdly kinda personal,
isn't it?

20:05.188 --> 20:07.557
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, man.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.590
Um...

20:09.592 --> 20:11.125
No.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.294
You've got a lot of issues,
Green Ninja.

20:13.297 --> 20:14.596
I hope you get the chance to

20:14.598 --> 20:16.297
work 'em all out
by the time I'm back.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.799
And when I return,

20:17.801 --> 20:20.434
I'll have something really
wicked in store for you.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.069
Something big!

20:22.071 --> 20:24.105
Uh, did he just say
he's coming back?

20:24.107 --> 20:26.508
Can't those Ninjas
get rid of him for good?

20:26.510 --> 20:30.110
Oh, great. Now I have to
rebuild my Pilates studio.

20:30.112 --> 20:31.212
That stinks.

20:31.214 --> 20:32.981
I don't know how,
but I bet Lloyd Garmadon

20:32.983 --> 20:34.148
has something to do with this.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.414
You can sure
say that again.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.217
I don't know how...

20:37.219 --> 20:39.253
Is that Green Ninja
still staring at me?

20:39.255 --> 20:40.922
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

20:40.924 --> 20:42.926
Ugh. What a weirdo.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.905
<i>Volcano base,
this is Alpha Squad.</i>

20:58.907 --> 21:00.575
<i>Arriving shortly at LZ.</i>

21:00.577 --> 21:01.974
<i>Bakery team,</i>

21:01.976 --> 21:03.377
<i>the victory cake
goes back in the fridge.</i>

21:03.379 --> 21:06.012
<i>The victory cake
goes back in the fridge.</i>

21:06.014 --> 21:08.549
<i>There is
a magma spill on Deck Three.</i>

21:08.551 --> 21:11.789
<i>Avoid Deck Three
if sensitive to magma.</i>

21:14.757 --> 21:16.722
<i>Just passed
Garmadon in the hallway,</i>

21:16.725 --> 21:17.991
<i>he seems pretty angry.</i>

21:17.993 --> 21:19.461
<i>He's requesting</i>

21:19.463 --> 21:22.296
<i>a mandatory staff meeting
by the fireplace.</i>

21:22.298 --> 21:23.764
<i>Is that
the room with the lava</i>

21:23.766 --> 21:25.265
<i>or the room
where people get fired?</i>

21:25.267 --> 21:26.633
<i>It's both.</i>

21:40.649 --> 21:42.584
Well, generals,

21:42.586 --> 21:44.752
congratulations.

21:44.754 --> 21:47.190
We finally conquered NINJAGO.

21:48.591 --> 21:51.925
I'm not certain we did that.

21:51.927 --> 21:53.962
- I was being sarcastic!
- Whoa!

21:53.964 --> 21:56.263
Every time I try
and conquer NINJAGO,

21:56.265 --> 21:58.867
that meddling Green Ninja
thwarts me.

21:58.869 --> 22:00.202
I mean,
who are these super ninjas?

22:00.204 --> 22:01.802
Every time I come up
with a new plan,

22:01.804 --> 22:03.104
they still beat me!

22:03.106 --> 22:04.872
And they don't even have
cool suits!

22:04.874 --> 22:06.039
You guys have, like,

22:06.042 --> 22:08.041
crab outfits
and shark outfits.

22:08.044 --> 22:10.944
I mean, maybe we're spending
too much on outfits.

22:10.946 --> 22:13.280
That sounds right to me, sir.

22:13.282 --> 22:14.449
Oh, come on!

22:14.451 --> 22:16.183
Look, you guys gotta
think for yourselves.

22:16.185 --> 22:18.252
I'm not your father,
all right?

22:18.254 --> 22:20.020
Is that a weird
thing for him to say to us?

22:20.022 --> 22:21.622
<i>General Number One,</i>

22:21.624 --> 22:23.824
do you wanna be a follower,
or do you wanna be a leader?

22:23.826 --> 22:26.360
Uh... A leader?

22:26.362 --> 22:28.363
How dare you.

22:28.365 --> 22:30.365
I mean, follower!

22:30.367 --> 22:31.531
You! What's your title?

22:31.533 --> 22:33.100
Uh, I'm General
Number Two, sir.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.702
Well, now,
you're General Number One.

22:34.705 --> 22:36.471
- Oh.
- And you, what's your title?

22:36.473 --> 22:37.739
General Three?

22:37.741 --> 22:38.971
Well, now you're
General Number Two.

22:38.973 --> 22:39.874
You see
where I'm going with this?

22:39.876 --> 22:40.774
No.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.077
I told the Green Ninja

22:42.079 --> 22:43.511
I was coming back
with something big,

22:43.513 --> 22:46.547
something wicked,
something with some pizzazz.

22:46.549 --> 22:48.148
General Number One,

22:48.150 --> 22:50.017
go ahead. Give me some ideas.

22:50.019 --> 22:51.552
Well, sir,
I was thinking maybe

22:51.554 --> 22:53.454
we could work
on the morale of the troops.

22:53.456 --> 22:56.455
They're always scared of being
fired!

22:56.458 --> 23:01.695
We could do the
same thing we did last time?

23:01.697 --> 23:03.063
Whoa!

23:03.065 --> 23:04.700
What if we dress up
as the Secret Ninjas?

23:04.702 --> 23:06.334
It's time we develop
a code language.

23:06.336 --> 23:08.868
Intimidation. We paint angry
eyebrows on the troops' faces.

23:08.870 --> 23:10.672
What if you just ran
for mayor?

23:10.674 --> 23:13.308
Whoa! Whoa!

23:13.310 --> 23:17.177
Oh, come on. How hard is it
to come up with a genius idea?

23:17.179 --> 23:18.713
<i>Anyone? Come on,
jump ball.</i>

23:18.715 --> 23:20.482
<i>This is a safe place.</i>

23:20.484 --> 23:21.982
Go ahead. Just grab it.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.484
- Excuse me, Lord...
- Nerd! You're interrupting.

23:24.486 --> 23:27.855
Sorry, sir. We just cooked
this up in engineering.

23:27.857 --> 23:29.460
Give me that!

23:30.659 --> 23:32.495
Garma-daddy likey!

23:37.234 --> 23:38.932
<i>- Lloyd...
- Yeah?</i>

23:38.934 --> 23:41.135
<i>That's your dad.
You were open, man.</i>

23:41.137 --> 23:43.805
<i>It was highly poignant.</i>

23:43.807 --> 23:45.206
<i>For me,
it's easy to fight him</i>

23:45.208 --> 23:46.974
<i>'cause he's, like,
not my father.</i>

23:46.976 --> 23:49.041
<i>But for you,
that must be so complicated.</i>

23:49.044 --> 23:50.611
<i>Not that complicated.</i>

23:50.613 --> 23:53.713
<i>You also really pulled
at my heartstrings, man.</i>

23:53.715 --> 23:55.781
I felt for you.

23:55.784 --> 23:57.085
With... With the missiles.

23:57.087 --> 23:58.854
No. With the other...
The other stuff.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.686
The dad stuff.

24:00.688 --> 24:03.657
Yeah, but, like, exactly what
are you referring to?

24:03.659 --> 24:06.092
- Watching you and your father.
- The vulnerability.

24:06.094 --> 24:07.426
You got so emotional.

24:07.429 --> 24:10.130
Emotions were the last thing

24:10.132 --> 24:12.767
that was going on out there.

24:12.769 --> 24:14.969
- Um, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

24:14.972 --> 24:17.971
It's okay, Lloyd.
Nobody's parents are perfect.

24:17.973 --> 24:21.009
I mean, my mom is weird
and collects seashells.

24:21.011 --> 24:24.412
Your dad levels cities
and attacks innocent people.

24:24.414 --> 24:27.047
So, they've all got
their quirks, you know?

24:28.451 --> 24:30.885
Uh, where's that
tranquil music coming from?

24:30.887 --> 24:34.122
<i>Hey, look, everyone!
Master Wu is back.</i>

24:34.124 --> 24:36.290
- Hello, students.
- Master Wu!

24:36.292 --> 24:38.125
- <i>Shock.</i>
- How was your trip?

24:38.127 --> 24:40.427
It was a deep
spiritual journey

24:40.429 --> 24:42.963
that took me to depths
inside myself

24:42.965 --> 24:44.298
I never knew existed.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.834
Yeah. You have
a pretty serious tan line.

24:46.836 --> 24:48.168
Don't judge me.

24:48.170 --> 24:50.338
So, did you see us kick
Garmadon's butt?

24:50.340 --> 24:52.106
- We vanquished him.
- Ba-ba bam!

24:52.108 --> 24:55.777
I saw you fight
and I saw Garmadon retreat.

24:55.779 --> 24:57.811
But you did not defeat him.

24:57.813 --> 24:59.213
What?

24:59.215 --> 25:02.149
There's nothing ninja
about you ninjas.

25:02.151 --> 25:03.885
We're so ninja. I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:03.887 --> 25:06.752
You will never
truly defeat Garmadon

25:06.755 --> 25:08.288
until you see things

25:08.290 --> 25:10.492
from a different
point of view.

25:10.494 --> 25:13.793
You have the power to win
the battle without fighting.

25:13.795 --> 25:15.829
When you start using
your mind,

25:15.831 --> 25:18.232
you won't need mechs
and machines.

25:18.234 --> 25:20.902
Your call signs
are not just cool names.

25:20.904 --> 25:24.905
They are the elemental powers
you were all born with.

25:24.907 --> 25:28.609
Nya, you can create water
on your own.

25:29.677 --> 25:32.146
- And Kai, fire!
- Wow!

25:32.148 --> 25:33.948
Jay, lightning.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.082
So ninja.

25:35.084 --> 25:37.484
- Cole, earth.
- Whoa!

25:37.486 --> 25:38.618
We both spin.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.320
And Zane, ice.

25:40.322 --> 25:41.489
Ice is nice.

25:41.491 --> 25:44.792
These elemental powers
are why I chose you

25:44.794 --> 25:46.593
to form
the Secret Ninja Force.

25:46.595 --> 25:50.264
It is the highest level that
you can achieve as a ninja.

25:50.266 --> 25:54.201
I wrote a book about it.
It's called <i>Ninjanuity.</i>

25:54.203 --> 25:55.569
Copyright, Master Wu.

25:55.571 --> 25:58.505
And what about me?
What am I?

25:58.507 --> 26:02.108
Lloyd, yours is the most
important element of all.

26:02.110 --> 26:03.810
Okay. Hit me with it.

26:03.812 --> 26:07.682
Your elemental power is green.

26:07.684 --> 26:09.616
- What's that?
- Green.

26:09.618 --> 26:12.052
Okay, so, uh, just to recap.

26:12.054 --> 26:14.888
Fire. Ice. Water. Earth.

26:14.890 --> 26:16.723
Lightning. And...

26:16.726 --> 26:17.991
Green.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.194
Don't think
it's an element though.

26:19.196 --> 26:20.694
- Lloyd...
- Can I be gold?

26:20.696 --> 26:21.994
- No.
- Wind isn't taken.

26:21.996 --> 26:23.063
Can I be wind?

26:23.065 --> 26:24.531
- No.
- Earth, green, and fire.

26:24.533 --> 26:25.999
- Rolls right off the tongue.
- Lloyd...

26:26.002 --> 26:29.236
Could I be
the element of surprise?

26:29.238 --> 26:31.572
No. That's the Fuchsia Ninja.

26:31.574 --> 26:33.006
Surprise.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.741
There are
so many elements left.

26:34.744 --> 26:37.677
This feels kinda purposeful
that I don't have one.

26:37.679 --> 26:40.682
Enough, Lloyd.
Come with me for mentor talk.

26:40.684 --> 26:43.251
The rest of you,
practice Spinjitzu.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.117
That's easy. Watch this.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.754
Exertion.

26:46.756 --> 26:48.422
For three hours.

26:48.424 --> 26:51.059
Three hours! Are you kidding
me with this guy!

26:51.061 --> 26:52.425
And read my book!

26:52.427 --> 26:55.032
Oh, man!

26:58.467 --> 27:01.401
Master Wu,
you don't understand.

27:01.404 --> 27:04.739
Right now, on that volcano...

27:04.741 --> 27:07.907
<i>Garmadon is making something
really big.</i>

27:07.909 --> 27:09.743
<i>He's building something huge.</i>

27:09.745 --> 27:13.347
<i>And something
surely shark themed.</i>

27:15.819 --> 27:18.989
<i>And he's gonna come back
sooner rather than later.</i>

27:19.589 --> 27:21.355
So, what do I do?

27:21.357 --> 27:25.325
Nephew, weapons alone
will not solve your problem.

27:25.327 --> 27:27.828
I have every kind of weapon
in my dojo.

27:27.830 --> 27:31.231
Big weapons, little weapons,
sharp weapons, dull weapons,

27:31.233 --> 27:32.899
even the Ultimate Weapon.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.434
But the strongest weapon
is inside you.

27:35.437 --> 27:37.637
Wait. I'm sorry,
what did you just say?

27:37.639 --> 27:39.405
The strongest weapon
is inside you.

27:39.407 --> 27:41.642
No, no, no. Before that.
The thing right before that.

27:41.644 --> 27:43.076
What? You mean...

27:43.079 --> 27:45.048
<i>The Ultimate Weapon!</i>

27:51.553 --> 27:53.654
And you've been
hiding this why?

27:53.656 --> 27:54.955
In the wrong hands,

27:54.957 --> 27:58.393
the Ultimate Weapon
could spell doom for NINJAGO.

27:58.395 --> 28:00.761
Put that in my hands.

28:00.763 --> 28:02.930
Why does it matter
how we beat Garmadon

28:02.932 --> 28:04.232
as long as we beat him?

28:04.234 --> 28:06.500
Because, nephew, right now,

28:06.502 --> 28:10.139
your hands
are the wrong hands.

28:16.746 --> 28:18.078
Lloyd,

28:18.080 --> 28:19.680
I'm his brother.

28:19.682 --> 28:23.550
I, too, feel responsible
for the safety of NINJAGO.

28:23.552 --> 28:26.019
But I will not always
be here to train you.

28:26.022 --> 28:27.887
- Why?
- Because,

28:27.889 --> 28:32.092
I'm super, super old.

28:32.094 --> 28:33.626
Oh.

28:33.628 --> 28:37.396
That's why I need you to
lead the Secret Ninja Force.

28:37.399 --> 28:40.867
But you must promise
to walk a different path.

28:40.869 --> 28:45.472
One that only
the son of Garmadon can walk.

28:45.474 --> 28:48.145
No matter how hard it may be.

28:50.213 --> 28:53.213
Honestly, I would
happily give up

28:53.215 --> 28:55.081
being a Secret Ninja

28:55.083 --> 28:59.252
if it meant I didn't have to
be the son of Garmadon.

28:59.254 --> 29:01.821
I know you've had
a hard life, Lloyd,

29:01.823 --> 29:03.457
filled with many knocks.

29:03.459 --> 29:05.292
Why don't I play you a song?

29:05.294 --> 29:07.426
Perhaps it will speak to you.

29:20.310 --> 29:21.578
Thanks, Uncle Wu.

29:41.263 --> 29:43.464
No, no.
I don't know where he is.

29:43.466 --> 29:45.668
No, he hasn't come home
from school.

29:47.837 --> 29:50.504
No, he did not join forces
with his father.

29:50.506 --> 29:53.109
That is ridiculous.
Like your husband's a saint.

29:58.047 --> 29:59.914
I am trying
not to freak out right now,

29:59.916 --> 30:01.482
but I have called 18 people

30:01.484 --> 30:03.451
and I cannot locate my son.

30:03.453 --> 30:04.684
Yes, I know you said you never

30:04.686 --> 30:06.353
wanted him to play
with your kids,

30:06.355 --> 30:08.556
I just didn't know if,
maybe...

30:08.558 --> 30:10.156
- Lloyd!
- Hey, Mom.

30:10.158 --> 30:12.193
No. I've got him right here.
He just walked in. Bye-bye.

30:12.195 --> 30:13.660
Oh, my gosh.
I was so worried about you.

30:13.662 --> 30:16.563
Uh, I'm fine. I just took
the long way home.

30:16.565 --> 30:17.632
Why did we get
on a family plan

30:17.634 --> 30:19.000
if you're not gonna text me?

30:19.002 --> 30:20.501
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to worry you.

30:20.503 --> 30:22.235
I love you and I'm sorry.

30:24.306 --> 30:25.638
I don't know what I'd do

30:25.640 --> 30:27.274
if anything
ever happened to you, okay?

30:27.276 --> 30:28.842
Thanks, Mom.

30:28.844 --> 30:31.310
I'm just really glad that
those ninjas saved the day.

30:31.312 --> 30:33.882
Yeah. Yeah, I was there.

30:33.884 --> 30:35.183
What?

30:35.185 --> 30:39.185
Watching with
the other regular kids.

30:39.187 --> 30:41.655
Okay. Well,
you must be starving.

30:41.657 --> 30:43.491
I don't know,
I'm not really that hungry.

30:43.493 --> 30:46.360
But I'll make your favorite.
Dumplings!

30:46.362 --> 30:49.364
Oh! Enticing,
but I'm just gonna...

30:49.366 --> 30:51.132
I'm just gonna go to bed,
I think.

30:51.134 --> 30:53.934
Just really tired.

30:53.936 --> 30:55.906
- Oh.
- Good night, Mom.

30:58.407 --> 31:00.276
Okay, well, good night.

31:07.884 --> 31:09.714
<i>And back
at number one with a bullet,</i>

31:09.716 --> 31:13.820
<i>no surprises there,
is</i> Boo, Lloyd, <i>the remix.</i>

31:13.822 --> 31:17.393
<i>L-L...
L-L-O-Y-D...</i>

31:18.695 --> 31:21.828
<i>L-L-O-Y-D.
His dad is bad and so is he.</i>

31:21.830 --> 31:24.631
<i>Boo, Lloyd!
Boo, Lloyd!</i>

31:24.633 --> 31:26.834
- Huh?
- What is that?

31:34.711 --> 31:37.677
<i>Hey, Green Ninja, I'm back!</i>

31:37.679 --> 31:39.914
<i>And look
what I brought with me.</i>

31:43.886 --> 31:45.254
<i>Breaking news.</i>

31:46.320 --> 31:48.056
Garmadon is attacking the city
in a never-before-seen mech.

31:48.058 --> 31:49.388
Run! Run!

31:49.391 --> 31:51.591
- Garmadon!
- Garmadon!

31:51.593 --> 31:53.260
You all came out to greet me?

31:53.262 --> 31:54.760
Don't run away.

31:54.763 --> 31:56.765
That's a nice little
hot dog stand you got there.

31:57.265 --> 31:58.598
Scu-smash!

31:58.600 --> 32:00.267
The Ninjas are going to have

32:00.269 --> 32:02.369
their hands full
with this thing.

32:02.371 --> 32:03.872
Ninja, go!

32:08.444 --> 32:10.344
We got a message
from your brother Garmadon.

32:10.346 --> 32:11.745
You wanna hear it?

32:11.747 --> 32:14.014
Oh, yeah? What did he say?

32:14.016 --> 32:16.716
He says you're a big stupid
dumb-dumb with a dumb face

32:16.718 --> 32:18.184
and a big butt
and your butt stinks

32:18.186 --> 32:20.120
and you smell like a butt.

32:20.122 --> 32:22.088
That sounds like my brother.

32:22.090 --> 32:23.257
Get him!

32:29.465 --> 32:30.897
- Jay.
- Yeah?

32:30.899 --> 32:32.098
You take the air.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.734
Kai, Zane and Cole, downtown.

32:34.736 --> 32:36.603
- Nya, water.
- You got it.

32:36.605 --> 32:38.070
I'm going
after Garmadon.

32:38.073 --> 32:40.508
Why don't I take
your dad this time?

32:40.510 --> 32:42.742
I got this. I'm totes profesh.

32:42.744 --> 32:44.278
Wait.
What does that mean?

32:44.280 --> 32:46.346
I think he's trying to say
he's a total professional.

32:46.349 --> 32:48.080
Then why is he
totes abbrevin'?

32:48.083 --> 32:49.715
I'm pretty sure
Lloyd's nervous.

32:49.718 --> 32:52.853
What?
That's crazy talk.

32:52.855 --> 32:54.055
Incorrect.

32:54.057 --> 32:55.489
Hey, I got this!

32:55.491 --> 32:57.157
Stand down, Garmadon.

32:57.159 --> 32:59.059
<i>Well, hello, Green Ninja!</i>

32:59.061 --> 33:02.829
It's time for you
to ninja go away for good.

33:02.831 --> 33:03.897
Take this!

33:03.899 --> 33:05.499
<i>Mega missile mode.</i>

33:05.501 --> 33:06.901
<i>Left claw missile.
Toenail missile. Wrist rocket.</i>

33:06.903 --> 33:09.036
<i>Feet bombs. Spine missile one,
two, three, four.</i>

33:09.038 --> 33:10.270
<i>Tail rocket one, two.</i>

33:10.272 --> 33:11.805
<i>Eye missile.
Other eye missile.</i>

33:11.807 --> 33:14.040
<i>Tongue rocket. Head missile.
Other head missile.</i>

33:14.042 --> 33:15.878
<i>Backup head missile.
Butt torpedoes.</i>

33:19.749 --> 33:22.819
<i>Your weapons are powerless
against my new mech.</i>

33:23.453 --> 33:24.518
What?

33:27.689 --> 33:29.357
Well, take this!

33:29.359 --> 33:31.157
<i>Releasing full payload.</i>

33:31.159 --> 33:32.492
Here it comes...

33:32.494 --> 33:34.060
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

33:34.062 --> 33:36.329
You having trouble with that
dragon mech, Green Ninja?

33:38.001 --> 33:39.066
Bye-bye.

33:39.068 --> 33:40.503
Wait. No!

33:43.539 --> 33:44.805
<i>Jay, what's happening?</i>

33:44.807 --> 33:46.874
Garmadon has
taken out Lloyd.

33:46.876 --> 33:48.308
<i>- What?
- Wait, what?</i>

33:48.310 --> 33:49.842
<i>I'm sorry.
What did you say?</i>

33:49.844 --> 33:53.013
<i>Repeat.
Garmadon has taken out Lloyd!</i>

34:00.522 --> 34:02.055
Looks like the police,
the army

34:02.058 --> 34:03.389
and the coast guard have

34:03.391 --> 34:05.826
<i>all been rendered useless
by Garmadon's forces.</i>

34:08.465 --> 34:10.898
<i>Guys, Garmadon's
almost at city hall.</i>

34:10.900 --> 34:13.467
<i>Can one of you
please stop him?</i>

34:13.469 --> 34:15.068
<i>I'm swamped down here.</i>

34:15.071 --> 34:16.670
<i>I'm a little busy.</i>

34:16.672 --> 34:19.373
<i>Look at me go!</i>

34:20.875 --> 34:23.976
<i>Who wants a shark?
You want a shark?</i>

34:23.978 --> 34:25.112
<i>You get a shark!</i>

34:25.114 --> 34:26.380
We're shark bait!

34:26.382 --> 34:27.947
Come on, come on, come on.

34:36.090 --> 34:40.462
Just walking up the tower.

34:43.031 --> 34:45.933
Uh, Lloyd would be
really beneficial right now.

34:47.101 --> 34:48.768
Where are you, Lloyd?

34:48.770 --> 34:51.070
I'm a ninja master!

34:52.308 --> 34:56.076
You are no match
for me! Whoo-hoo!

34:56.078 --> 34:58.878
I came here to drink boba
and kick butt,

34:58.880 --> 35:01.417
and I am all out of boba.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.388
Hey, NINJAGO!

35:09.391 --> 35:11.192
Oh, wait. That's bad.

35:11.194 --> 35:15.195
<i>Garmadon
is conquering NINJAGO!</i>

35:17.099 --> 35:20.733
<i>Robin, this is a day
that will live in infamy.</i>

35:20.735 --> 35:22.168
- I just made that up.
- No, you didn't.

35:22.170 --> 35:23.704
Yes, I did.
Copyright, Michael Strahan.

35:23.706 --> 35:24.770
It's mine now.

35:24.773 --> 35:27.039
Whoo! I've done it!

35:27.042 --> 35:30.478
I'm finally the ruler
of NINJAGO!

35:30.480 --> 35:33.279
Forever! And ever!

35:35.817 --> 35:37.953
Stand down, Garmadon!

35:40.956 --> 35:42.192
Green Ninja?

35:43.759 --> 35:46.626
And the legendary
Ultimate Weapon?

35:46.628 --> 35:48.464
Ugh, it's not fair.

35:50.833 --> 35:54.432
I'm sick and tired of you
trying to conquer NINJAGO!

35:54.435 --> 35:57.804
All right, Green Ninja.
Now, listen. Just calm down.

35:57.806 --> 35:59.606
You don't have to use
that thing.

35:59.608 --> 36:01.174
So you're gonna leave NINJAGO?

36:01.176 --> 36:02.341
- Yeah.
- Forever?

36:02.343 --> 36:04.277
I promise.

36:04.279 --> 36:06.246
Why is your hand
behind your back?

36:06.248 --> 36:08.382
What are you doing back there?
Are you crossing your fingers?

36:08.384 --> 36:10.116
That's physically impossible.

36:10.118 --> 36:12.286
How could I be crossing my
fingers? I have these things.

36:12.288 --> 36:13.552
I'm warning you, Garmadon!

36:13.554 --> 36:15.788
Fine! No crossies!
No crossies!

36:15.790 --> 36:17.791
Just chill. Okay.
Look,

36:17.793 --> 36:19.425
I'm getting rid
of all my sharks.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.161
See? No sharks.

36:21.163 --> 36:23.095
And the sharks
in your ankle holster.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.831
I don't have any sharks.

36:24.833 --> 36:26.967
- What's in your ankle?
- It's a couple dolphins, man.

36:26.969 --> 36:29.203
Now you're acting loco.
I mean...

36:29.205 --> 36:30.370
Hey! Get rid of 'em.

36:30.373 --> 36:32.672
Fine. You happy now?

36:32.674 --> 36:35.006
I'm done. You win.

36:35.008 --> 36:36.642
What are you doing?
What are you doing right now?

36:36.644 --> 36:38.478
Easy, Green Ninja.

36:38.480 --> 36:39.645
Don't come any closer!

36:39.647 --> 36:41.148
Easy.

36:41.150 --> 36:43.015
I'm warning you,
Garmadon.

36:43.017 --> 36:46.152
Let's just keep
this interaction very chill.

36:46.154 --> 36:49.222
I'm the definition
of chill right now!

36:49.224 --> 36:51.090
I know.

36:55.230 --> 36:56.395
Stand back!

36:56.398 --> 36:58.664
Put down the Ultimate Weapon,
Green Ninja.

36:58.666 --> 37:00.666
We both know
you're not gonna fire it.

37:00.668 --> 37:02.936
Oh, yeah?
This is your last chance.

37:02.938 --> 37:07.273
Get out of NINJAGO,
now and forever!

37:07.275 --> 37:08.543
No.

37:08.545 --> 37:10.310
All right, fine.
You ready for this?

37:10.312 --> 37:11.678
- Yeah.
- It's coming.

37:11.681 --> 37:13.112
- Okay.
- You've been warned.

37:13.114 --> 37:14.680
- I'm waiting.
- Here it comes.

37:14.682 --> 37:16.349
- Any time.
- All right,

37:16.351 --> 37:18.585
here it comes!

37:18.587 --> 37:19.987
Oh, my gosh!

37:19.989 --> 37:23.023
He actually shot
and it exploded, and then...

37:23.025 --> 37:26.726
But nothing is happening.
Why is nothing happening?

37:26.728 --> 37:28.027
What the heck?

37:28.029 --> 37:29.563
It's like
the Ultimate Lamest Weapon.

37:29.565 --> 37:31.330
Come on!

37:31.332 --> 37:32.866
Why won't you work?

37:32.868 --> 37:35.735
Get off my Vespa!

37:39.674 --> 37:41.176
You hear that?

37:43.679 --> 37:45.045
What have you done?

37:49.618 --> 37:51.119
Whoa.

37:57.259 --> 37:59.295
Aw!

38:02.831 --> 38:04.900
How do I turn this thing off?

38:07.036 --> 38:08.466
Ah.

38:08.469 --> 38:09.703
Come on!

38:13.074 --> 38:14.808
Generals,
grab the Green Ninja.

38:14.810 --> 38:16.378
Keep away.

38:18.681 --> 38:20.114
Whoa. Whoa.

38:20.116 --> 38:21.715
Wait!

38:21.717 --> 38:22.782
Wait! No, no, no!

38:22.784 --> 38:24.083
Remember, Green Ninja,

38:24.085 --> 38:26.887
I didn't fire this thing
first. That's on you.

38:26.889 --> 38:28.956
But, since you got it all
warmed up,

38:28.958 --> 38:31.657
let's try it
on some moving targets.

38:34.394 --> 38:35.663
No!

38:38.766 --> 38:40.770
What the heck!

38:45.775 --> 38:48.342
Stop it, Garmadon!
Just stop it!

38:51.480 --> 38:53.314
What is this thing?

39:04.860 --> 39:07.360
I'm gonna throw up!

39:10.898 --> 39:13.835
Prolonged scream.

39:21.576 --> 39:22.878
Five ninjas down,

39:23.411 --> 39:24.446
one to go.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.795
Bang! I win! Cue the music!

39:43.265 --> 39:44.265
Whoo!

39:47.402 --> 39:48.701
Awesome job, sir!

39:48.703 --> 39:50.771
What? Are you gonna cry?

39:50.773 --> 39:52.206
I'm not gonna cry.

39:52.208 --> 39:53.738
I bet he's gonna cry.

39:55.677 --> 39:57.714
I'm not gonna cry...

39:58.246 --> 39:59.246
Dad.

40:06.422 --> 40:07.420
La-Loyd?

40:07.422 --> 40:10.623
That's right!
It's me! Your son!

40:10.625 --> 40:12.658
And it's Lloyd, Dad.

40:12.660 --> 40:16.829
No. L-L-O-Y-D. I named you.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.298
You ruined my life!

40:18.300 --> 40:20.737
How could I ruin your life?
I wasn't even there.

40:34.148 --> 40:36.418
I wish you weren't my father.

40:53.302 --> 40:56.101
And we're back in
three, two, one...

40:56.103 --> 40:58.806
Welcome back, NINJAGO.
I'm Robin Roberts.

40:58.808 --> 41:00.672
And as you can see,
our city is in the midst

41:00.674 --> 41:02.409
of total annihilation.

41:02.411 --> 41:04.110
<i>And for a city
that gets attacked</i>

41:04.112 --> 41:05.779
<i>pretty frequently, Robin...</i>

41:07.080 --> 41:08.348
<i>...that's really
saying something.</i>

41:08.351 --> 41:10.217
<i>As we struggle
to survive,</i>

41:10.219 --> 41:12.119
<i>we're left
with so many questions like,</i>

41:12.121 --> 41:14.221
<i>"Who has
truly conquered NINJAGO?"</i>

41:14.223 --> 41:16.525
<i>The monster?</i>

41:17.992 --> 41:20.259
<i>Or Garmadon?</i>

41:20.261 --> 41:22.295
We did it!

41:22.297 --> 41:23.366
Party time!

41:25.368 --> 41:26.464
Incoming!

41:26.467 --> 41:27.633
We did it!

41:27.635 --> 41:29.636
Let's go.

41:31.741 --> 41:34.041
"I wish you weren't
my father."

41:34.043 --> 41:35.641
Huh?

41:35.643 --> 41:38.145
Is it just me, or was that
kind of a weird thing to say?

41:38.147 --> 41:40.045
"I wish
you weren't my father."

41:40.047 --> 41:42.849
And the tone,
it was so disrespectful.

41:42.851 --> 41:44.451
Yes, sir.
Plus, he tried to shoot you.

41:44.453 --> 41:47.253
Yeah! Right before you
totally conquered his city!

41:47.255 --> 41:49.322
We
conquered your greatest foe,

41:49.324 --> 41:51.125
turned out to be
your son though...

41:51.127 --> 41:52.625
I'm sure he meant it
as a compliment,

41:52.627 --> 41:56.063
but it's a weird thing, right?
General Number One!

41:56.065 --> 41:57.163
Sir!

41:57.165 --> 41:58.831
Have you captured my son yet?

41:58.833 --> 42:01.099
No, not yet, sir.

42:01.101 --> 42:02.668
And yet, here you are.

42:02.670 --> 42:04.037
Partying on the rooftops

42:04.040 --> 42:06.706
with a paper umbrella
in your drink.

42:07.909 --> 42:09.208
What about
La-Loyd's ninja friends?

42:09.210 --> 42:10.676
You captured any of them yet?

42:10.678 --> 42:12.112
No, sir.

42:12.114 --> 42:13.947
And what about my brother, Wu?

42:13.949 --> 42:15.581
No, sir.

42:15.583 --> 42:18.217
What about my ex, Koko?
You found her?

42:18.219 --> 42:20.487
No, sir.

42:20.489 --> 42:21.753
Well, you certainly
had no trouble

42:21.755 --> 42:22.822
finding the bar, did you?

42:22.824 --> 42:24.257
We're on it, sir.

42:24.259 --> 42:25.625
We searched the whole city
from top to bottom.

42:25.627 --> 42:28.060
You're not on the list.
Oh! My clipboard!

42:28.063 --> 42:30.499
Look, here she is now.

42:37.272 --> 42:39.840
Hey, Koko.
Glad you made it to the party.

42:39.842 --> 42:41.339
Pretty on the chain, isn't it?

42:41.341 --> 42:43.677
Wipe that smile off your face,
Garmadon.

42:43.679 --> 42:45.311
Ugh, same old Kokes.

42:45.313 --> 42:48.114
It just kills you to see me
having any fun, doesn't it?

42:48.116 --> 42:49.982
Oh, by the way,
uh, quick question.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.284
What was it again?

42:51.286 --> 42:53.487
Oh, yeah. Why did you
turn our son against me?

42:53.489 --> 42:56.354
Me? You turned him
against you, Garm.

42:56.356 --> 42:58.190
You're a maniacal
twisted villain.

42:58.192 --> 43:00.159
All right, look,
enough with the compliments.

43:00.161 --> 43:02.262
Whose idea was it for him
to become a ninja?

43:02.264 --> 43:04.130
Lloyd is not a ninja.

43:04.132 --> 43:06.032
Who's the absentee parent now?

43:06.034 --> 43:07.333
What are you talking about?

43:07.335 --> 43:10.837
La-Loyd. He's the Green Ninja.

43:10.839 --> 43:11.971
One of my greatest enemies,

43:11.973 --> 43:14.273
honor-bound
and sworn to destroy me.

43:14.275 --> 43:17.143
You know what he said to me?
He said that he wished...

43:17.145 --> 43:18.945
What have you done with him?

43:22.717 --> 43:24.286
Where's Lloyd?

43:25.922 --> 43:27.920
My gosh, woman,
what happened to us?

43:27.922 --> 43:31.291
- Ugh.
- I miss that fire.

43:31.293 --> 43:34.392
You know, I've always tried
to get Lloyd to see

43:34.394 --> 43:37.663
that he shouldn't be ashamed
of who his father is.

43:37.665 --> 43:40.500
But now,

43:40.502 --> 43:43.139
I'm starting to think
he could be right.

44:30.185 --> 44:33.121
Oh, no. No, no. Please.
Please, no.

44:35.590 --> 44:36.992
Uncle Wu...

44:40.594 --> 44:42.529
Oh, my gosh!
You guys are okay!

44:42.531 --> 44:43.396
Barely.

44:43.398 --> 44:45.099
You used the Ultimate Weapon.

44:45.101 --> 44:46.300
Not cool.

44:46.302 --> 44:47.701
Dude,
our mechs are totaled.

44:47.703 --> 44:49.335
And now,
that cat's destroying NINJAGO.

44:49.337 --> 44:51.204
We were the only people
that didn't hate you,

44:51.206 --> 44:52.806
and now we hate you!

44:52.808 --> 44:56.107
Deleting all data related to
treating Lloyd as a friend.

44:58.145 --> 44:59.913
Guys, I'm sorry.

44:59.915 --> 45:04.817
I put everyone in danger
and now Master Wu is dead.

45:04.819 --> 45:06.853
Hello, students.

45:06.855 --> 45:08.120
Master Wu!

45:08.123 --> 45:10.022
You're alive!

45:10.024 --> 45:12.024
Duh! I'm a ninja master.

45:12.026 --> 45:16.061
If I was gonna die, it would
be to teach you a lesson.

45:17.299 --> 45:19.866
Lloyd, you have
awakened Meowthra.

45:19.868 --> 45:20.933
Meowthra?

45:20.935 --> 45:22.701
Yes, Meowthra.

45:22.703 --> 45:27.474
<i>The six-toed fluffy demon,
with her sandpaper tongue.</i>

45:27.476 --> 45:30.776
<i>Her reign of terror
will stretch on and on</i>

45:30.779 --> 45:35.680
<i>until all of NINJAGO is her
own personal litter box.</i>

45:37.786 --> 45:39.217
There's only one hope.

45:39.219 --> 45:42.521
One thing that can drive
Meowthra away.

45:42.523 --> 45:44.456
- What?
- What is it?

45:44.458 --> 45:46.561
The Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

45:51.632 --> 45:52.998
Whoa!

45:53.000 --> 45:54.266
Where is this thing?

45:54.268 --> 45:56.469
On the other side
of the island,

45:56.471 --> 45:59.972
hidden where only a true
ninja master can find it.

45:59.974 --> 46:02.308
<i>You must follow
the right path.</i>

46:02.310 --> 46:04.411
<i>Otherwise you will end up</i>

46:04.413 --> 46:08.714
<i>trapped in the deadly
Jungle of Lost Souls,</i>

46:08.717 --> 46:11.918
<i>unable to cross the Bridge
of Fallen Mentors,</i>

46:11.920 --> 46:16.455
<i>and mired in the Canyon of
General Unhappiness.</i>

46:16.458 --> 46:18.257
And if you're still alive,

46:18.259 --> 46:19.592
<i>you'll be crushed</i>

46:19.594 --> 46:21.034
<i>by the Temple of
Fragile Foundations.</i>

46:22.130 --> 46:25.864
It's a journey many have tried
and none have returned.

46:25.866 --> 46:28.400
That does sound difficult.

46:28.402 --> 46:29.634
And terrifying.

46:29.636 --> 46:31.137
But you know what?
We're ready.

46:31.139 --> 46:32.672
No, you're not.

46:32.674 --> 46:35.708
It will take great patience,
courage, and hard work.

46:35.710 --> 46:38.777
All the skills
of a true ninja master.

46:38.779 --> 46:43.416
So, I will make this journey
on my own. Bye.

46:43.418 --> 46:44.983
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Master Wu, wait!

46:44.985 --> 46:47.521
Hold on a second, please.

46:47.523 --> 46:49.554
Master Wu,
I know I let NINJAGO down.

46:49.556 --> 46:52.326
It's true, Lloyd let
NINJAGO down. Sorry, dude!

46:52.328 --> 46:53.860
We want to fix
his terrible mistake.

46:53.862 --> 46:55.761
- Train us to be true ninjas.
- We have the potential.

46:55.764 --> 46:57.230
- Come on!
- Wait! We'll do anything.

46:57.232 --> 46:58.831
Please, Master Wu,

46:58.833 --> 47:00.500
you can't do this alone.

47:00.502 --> 47:02.467
I know we're not
ninja masters yet,

47:02.469 --> 47:04.337
but you said it yourself.

47:04.339 --> 47:07.706
It's important
to look at things differently.

47:07.708 --> 47:11.813
Is there anything I can do
to change your point of view?

47:12.813 --> 47:14.213
Hmm.

47:14.215 --> 47:17.752
Students, are you willing
to give Lloyd a second chance?

47:19.755 --> 47:20.887
Uh...

47:20.889 --> 47:22.053
- Too soon.
- No.

47:22.055 --> 47:23.355
- Pass.
- Just processing, so...

47:23.357 --> 47:25.358
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

47:25.360 --> 47:27.527
Lloyd, you have
a long way to go

47:27.529 --> 47:30.062
to regain your friends' trust.

47:30.065 --> 47:34.333
Luckily, there's a long
journey ahead of us.

47:34.335 --> 47:36.902
Thank you, Master Wu.
Thank you.

47:36.904 --> 47:40.239
The fate of NINJAGO
is in your hands.

47:40.241 --> 47:41.375
Are you ready?

47:41.377 --> 47:43.108
- Yes, I am on it!
- Oh, yeah!

47:43.110 --> 47:44.709
- Yep!
- Maybe.

47:44.711 --> 47:45.813
Let's go!

47:53.389 --> 47:55.657
Sir, I think we found them.

47:56.924 --> 47:58.759
There's a group of
brightly colored ninjas

47:58.761 --> 48:01.527
heading towards the obviously
dangerous jungle.

48:01.529 --> 48:04.130
Mm. Zoom in a little closer.

48:04.132 --> 48:05.697
Closer.

48:07.268 --> 48:09.902
No, closer. Closer.

48:09.904 --> 48:13.507
Yes! Right in on my stupid
brother's dirty beard.

48:13.509 --> 48:16.074
What's he saying?
Something about a weapon.

48:16.076 --> 48:18.377
The Omelet Omelet weapon.

48:18.380 --> 48:20.480
It sounds delicious.

48:20.482 --> 48:22.782
Delicious, yet quite possibly
dangerous.

48:22.784 --> 48:25.651
He's talking about
an Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

48:25.653 --> 48:28.554
That's what I said,
the Ultimate Omelet Weapon.

48:28.556 --> 48:30.290
Sir, where are you going?

48:30.292 --> 48:31.657
This is pure warrior stuff.

48:31.659 --> 48:33.726
Alone in the field,
tracking ninjas.

48:33.728 --> 48:35.493
Finding out exactly
what La-Loyd meant

48:35.496 --> 48:37.697
when he said, "I wish
you weren't my father."

48:37.699 --> 48:39.501
So, I guess
I'm going to the jungle.

49:06.594 --> 49:08.694
Dope fluting, Master Wu.

49:08.696 --> 49:09.697
Thank you.

49:11.599 --> 49:13.166
Students,

49:13.168 --> 49:18.639
your elemental powers come
from this lush green world.

49:18.641 --> 49:22.610
Feel the energy
flowing through you.

49:24.513 --> 49:26.913
Good. Good.

49:26.915 --> 49:29.817
The power is inside you.

49:30.652 --> 49:33.119
Now say to yourself,

49:33.121 --> 49:35.221
"I've got the power."

49:39.094 --> 49:40.595
I've got the power!

49:41.295 --> 49:42.498
What was that?

49:45.266 --> 49:47.502
Mm. Ninja tracks!

49:48.670 --> 49:52.404
I sense the presence of evil.

49:52.406 --> 49:54.873
Students, true ninja knows
when to fight

49:54.875 --> 49:57.576
and when to become one
with the elements.

49:57.578 --> 49:59.512
<i>Quickly, blend in the shadows.</i>

50:02.683 --> 50:04.717
You are all terrible ninjas.

50:04.719 --> 50:07.487
I will take care of Garmadon
on my own.

50:07.489 --> 50:08.554
I'm close.

50:08.556 --> 50:10.824
- He's close.
- Real close.

50:10.826 --> 50:12.094
Really close.

50:19.134 --> 50:20.266
- You!
- You!

50:33.380 --> 50:34.913
Oh, hello, brother.

50:34.915 --> 50:38.918
Where are your
little ninja nerds?

50:38.920 --> 50:40.051
Nailed it.

50:40.053 --> 50:41.221
They are surrounding you,

50:41.223 --> 50:43.055
perfectly hidden.
Ready to strike.

50:43.058 --> 50:44.491
Oh, really?

50:46.693 --> 50:48.360
Students, next lesson.

50:48.362 --> 50:50.096
How to fight
like a true ninja...

50:57.839 --> 51:00.373
Ow! Ow!

51:00.375 --> 51:01.873
Ow!

51:01.875 --> 51:02.877
Huh?

51:09.417 --> 51:10.583
Ah.

51:10.585 --> 51:13.585
Oh, look at me!
I'm Master Wu!

51:13.587 --> 51:16.657
Today's lesson is something
totally boring!

51:21.797 --> 51:23.163
Looks like you need a lesson

51:23.165 --> 51:25.599
in learning how to shut
your stupid face.

51:25.601 --> 51:27.500
Well, here's something
you won't learn in school,

51:27.502 --> 51:29.601
the Seven Deadly Butterflies
of Shaolin.

51:29.603 --> 51:31.102
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven!

51:31.105 --> 51:32.940
I don't need a deadly
butterfly to beat you.

51:34.042 --> 51:35.808
Hyah!

51:35.810 --> 51:37.677
We are totes
blending in right now.

51:37.679 --> 51:38.911
I can still see you!

51:38.913 --> 51:40.581
- Oh, man.
- Come on, this way.

51:53.161 --> 51:55.029
Ho-ho! Wu's your daddy?

51:57.598 --> 51:59.133
- Huh?
- Ha!

52:01.469 --> 52:02.735
Get off of my head.

52:02.737 --> 52:04.003
Hey, bro,
get off my foot!

52:04.005 --> 52:05.304
- Get off!
- No, you get off my foot

52:05.306 --> 52:06.808
so I can kick you in the head.

52:13.313 --> 52:14.614
Whoa!

52:16.750 --> 52:18.985
Ow.

52:18.987 --> 52:20.051
Master Wu!

52:20.053 --> 52:22.387
- Look out! He's behind you!
- Where?

52:25.393 --> 52:26.458
Oh!

52:26.460 --> 52:28.828
Really? Tighty-whities? Still?

52:28.830 --> 52:30.496
Face it,
you're out of moves, Wu.

52:30.498 --> 52:32.599
Oh, yeah? How about this one?

52:32.601 --> 52:33.836
Oh-oh.

52:35.203 --> 52:37.603
I call it the Caged Monkey..

52:37.605 --> 52:39.271
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me!

52:39.273 --> 52:41.171
Gasp.

52:41.174 --> 52:42.675
And that, my students,

52:42.677 --> 52:45.545
is how you fight
like a true ninja.

52:45.547 --> 52:47.812
Well, a true ninja

52:47.815 --> 52:50.016
would have counted
all seven butterflies.

52:50.018 --> 52:51.483
What? I did.

52:51.485 --> 52:54.253
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

52:54.255 --> 52:55.422
Seven.

53:00.895 --> 53:02.195
No!

53:25.552 --> 53:26.886
Master Wu!

53:26.888 --> 53:29.322
Lloyd, always remember...

53:29.324 --> 53:30.655
Yeah?

53:30.657 --> 53:34.293
Stay on the right path
to find your inner peace.

53:34.295 --> 53:35.962
- No, no, no.
- Oh, my gosh!

53:35.964 --> 53:37.630
Master Wu, we need you,
please! Don't leave!

53:37.632 --> 53:38.864
Uncle Wu!

53:38.866 --> 53:41.099
Did he say inner peace?

53:41.101 --> 53:42.235
The right path?

53:42.237 --> 53:43.536
Why is he bringing
these things up

53:43.538 --> 53:45.204
so late in our adventure?

53:45.206 --> 53:47.074
Well, well, well.

53:51.612 --> 53:54.582
Looks like your precious
ninja master's gone.

53:55.882 --> 53:57.217
Now, come on, La-Loyd.

53:57.219 --> 53:59.886
Open the cage.
Let out your papa.

53:59.888 --> 54:01.687
So, now you wanna be my dad?

54:01.689 --> 54:03.623
I'm not gonna
ask you again, La-Loyd.

54:03.625 --> 54:05.761
Open the cage right now.

54:06.295 --> 54:07.628
One...

54:09.062 --> 54:10.132
Two...

54:11.498 --> 54:12.801
Three...

54:15.268 --> 54:17.235
I thought that was
supposed to work with kids.

54:17.237 --> 54:20.005
Listen, La-Loyd and friends
whose names I don't know...

54:20.007 --> 54:21.775
- I'm Jay.
- It's not a question.

54:21.777 --> 54:24.075
Oh.

54:24.077 --> 54:26.112
Now, for you to make it
through this journey alive,

54:26.114 --> 54:28.681
you're gonna need someone
to teach you the ninja way.

54:28.683 --> 54:30.082
What do you know
about being a ninja?

54:30.085 --> 54:32.384
Oh, I know plenty, La-Loyd.

54:32.386 --> 54:34.718
You don't get to be a warlord
without knowing a thing or two

54:34.720 --> 54:36.221
about the ninja arts.

54:36.223 --> 54:38.257
The dark ninja arts.

54:39.725 --> 54:41.559
What is that?

54:41.561 --> 54:42.628
You're a ninja?

54:42.630 --> 54:44.197
Indeed, I am.

54:44.199 --> 54:46.532
As a matter of fact, I wrote
the book on Ninjelligence.

54:46.534 --> 54:48.832
Why are there
so many one-star reviews?

54:48.835 --> 54:50.770
I think that's trolls,
personally.

54:50.772 --> 54:52.538
- Oh.
- We don't need your book,

54:52.540 --> 54:54.139
Garmadon. Wu is our master.

54:54.141 --> 54:55.641
Well, Wu is gone.

54:55.643 --> 54:57.976
And you're gonna need me to
get you out of this jungle,

54:57.978 --> 54:59.143
or you're all gonna die.

54:59.145 --> 55:00.945
Oh, great!
We're all gonna die.

55:00.947 --> 55:02.581
We're not gonna die, Jay.

55:02.583 --> 55:04.383
And while
I'm keeping you alive,

55:04.386 --> 55:07.587
maybe I'll teach you some of
my sick dark ninja moves,

55:07.589 --> 55:09.288
like the Buzzkill.

55:09.290 --> 55:10.255
Wow.

55:10.257 --> 55:11.824
- The Miso Slap.
- Wow.

55:11.826 --> 55:13.659
- Or the Chainsaw Chop.
- Wow.

55:13.661 --> 55:15.493
- Or the Dance of Doom.
- Wow.

55:15.496 --> 55:16.962
Hang on just a second.

55:16.964 --> 55:19.031
This is Garmadon
we're talking about.

55:19.033 --> 55:20.366
We can still make it to

55:20.368 --> 55:22.301
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon
on our own.

55:22.303 --> 55:24.637
We just have to remember
what Master Wu taught us.

55:24.639 --> 55:28.007
All I can remember is
we really need a ninja master.

55:28.009 --> 55:30.678
And you are not
a ninja master.

55:31.813 --> 55:33.913
So what are we gonna do?

55:33.915 --> 55:36.382
We take him.

55:36.384 --> 55:37.886
Fantastic!

55:40.188 --> 55:41.587
You know what's funny?

55:41.589 --> 55:44.857
I had La-Loyd
when I was 158 years old.

55:44.859 --> 55:46.625
- Wow.
- Wait a minute.

55:46.627 --> 55:49.526
- You're 174?
- Yes.

55:49.529 --> 55:52.097
Master Wu says he's 167,

55:52.099 --> 55:54.064
and he's your younger brother?

55:54.066 --> 55:55.367
He's my younger brother.
Correct.

55:55.369 --> 55:58.170
How is that possible?
You look much...

55:58.172 --> 55:59.137
Younger.

55:59.139 --> 56:00.672
- Thank you.
- Yeah, do you moisturize?

56:00.674 --> 56:03.043
Yes, that's when I got
the upper hand on Master Wu.

56:03.045 --> 56:05.009
- "Upper hands."
- Yeah, upper hands.

56:05.011 --> 56:06.545
How did you gain two arms?

56:06.547 --> 56:07.980
Oh, don't put it like that.

56:07.982 --> 56:09.748
I don't know if that's
the best way to say it.

56:09.750 --> 56:11.282
- Well, he's got four arms.
- Correct!

56:11.284 --> 56:12.985
You know, a lot of people
don't ask me about it.

56:12.987 --> 56:14.920
So, I'm glad
that he's comfortable asking.

56:14.922 --> 56:16.188
Lloyd's never asked me once
about my arms.

56:16.190 --> 56:18.590
- Have you, Lloyd?
- Don't talk to me.

56:18.592 --> 56:19.692
I was bit by a snake.

56:19.694 --> 56:20.893
- No!
- Yes.

56:20.895 --> 56:22.195
So the snake
had a bunch of arms?

56:22.197 --> 56:23.828
- They don't have arms.
- Exactly.

56:23.831 --> 56:24.896
Do you mean like a spider?

56:24.898 --> 56:26.266
Oh, no, I was bit by a snake.

56:26.268 --> 56:27.800
And the snake
had been bitten by a spider.

56:27.802 --> 56:28.902
And then the snake bit me.

56:28.904 --> 56:30.402
- Oh.
- Are you guys actually

56:30.404 --> 56:31.837
buying any of this?

56:31.839 --> 56:33.438
How else would you explain it,
La-Loyd? You weren't there.

56:33.440 --> 56:35.275
So, when the two extra arms
started growing,

56:35.277 --> 56:36.909
were you like, "Yes, this is
awesome!" Or were you like...

56:36.911 --> 56:38.444
No, at first, I was, like,
totally freaked out,

56:38.446 --> 56:40.482
and sometimes
I get self-conscious about it.

56:42.549 --> 56:43.616
Hey, uh, Garmadon.

56:43.618 --> 56:44.683
Can I ask you
another question?

56:44.685 --> 56:46.217
Yeah, go ahead.

56:46.219 --> 56:48.954
It's about the arms. Um,
can you shake your own hand?

56:48.956 --> 56:51.056
- Look! Check it out, ninjas.
- Oh, my gosh.

56:51.058 --> 56:52.858
Oh, he's his own best friend!

56:52.860 --> 56:54.124
Oh, the double shake!

56:54.127 --> 56:55.594
I love your bad boy charm.

56:55.596 --> 56:57.329
Look at this. This is one of
my favorite things.

56:57.331 --> 56:58.963
I look like I'm making out
with two people, don't I?

56:58.965 --> 57:01.266
- I'm impressed.
- Wonderful amusement!

57:01.268 --> 57:03.235
Hey, you know what?
We should, uh...

57:03.237 --> 57:05.637
We should be
practicing silence right now.

57:05.639 --> 57:07.072
Sorry.

57:07.074 --> 57:09.708
It's just, when you talk,
I don't wanna listen,

57:09.710 --> 57:12.078
but when he talks,
I wanna listen.

57:12.080 --> 57:12.978
I agree.

57:12.980 --> 57:14.412
I've always said
he's weak-voiced.

57:14.415 --> 57:15.882
I think we're gettin'
off point a little bit,

57:15.884 --> 57:17.250
just a little bit.

57:17.252 --> 57:18.518
You see what I mean
about the weak voice?

57:18.520 --> 57:19.985
"Like a little bit!"

57:19.987 --> 57:21.219
- That's how he talks.
- Do it again.

57:21.221 --> 57:22.755
"A little bit!"

57:22.757 --> 57:24.323
Oh, that's not how I...
That doesn't sound like me!

57:24.325 --> 57:26.625
His sounds more like this.

57:26.627 --> 57:27.994
Look what he's doing to us!

57:27.996 --> 57:30.096
We have to focus.
He's turning our minds.

57:30.098 --> 57:31.563
Thank you, Zane. You get it.

57:31.565 --> 57:34.835
My sensors indicate
a fork in the road.

57:35.871 --> 57:37.435
Hmm.

57:37.438 --> 57:40.739
The right path is long,
and arduous, and enlightening.

57:40.741 --> 57:43.509
And the left... A shortcut!

57:43.511 --> 57:45.043
Why would
they say "possible"?

57:45.045 --> 57:46.411
They would know, right?

57:46.413 --> 57:47.947
We're taking the shortcut.
Let's roll!

57:47.949 --> 57:49.681
No, no.
Okay. Just wait.

57:49.683 --> 57:52.217
Master Wu said we should stay
on the right path.

57:52.219 --> 57:53.552
What?

57:53.554 --> 57:55.121
You wanna listen to the guy
who fell off the bridge,

57:55.123 --> 57:56.763
or the guy who didn't
fall off the bridge?

57:59.393 --> 58:01.393
Hey, Zane,
could you record this

58:01.395 --> 58:03.027
and then
never play it back to me?

58:03.029 --> 58:05.432
Yes.

58:06.333 --> 58:09.335
Um... Guys?

58:09.337 --> 58:11.540
Maybe this isn't
such a great idea.

58:19.179 --> 58:22.215
This is my least favorite
place I've ever been in.

58:22.217 --> 58:25.287
Did you hear that?

58:27.255 --> 58:29.188
- We're backing it out.
- What?

58:29.190 --> 58:30.989
- We're backing out.
- What did you just say?

58:30.991 --> 58:32.090
- We're backing out.
- Go, go, go.

58:32.092 --> 58:33.893
Back it.
Continue to back it out.

58:33.895 --> 58:35.326
Continue to back it out.

58:35.328 --> 58:37.096
Alert. More danger.

58:37.098 --> 58:39.065
- I'm gonna throw up.
- What do we do?

58:39.067 --> 58:40.333
There's too many of them.

58:40.335 --> 58:43.168
Wait a minute.
Oh, my gosh. La-Loyd,

58:43.170 --> 58:46.905
they look like
my former General Number Ones.

58:46.907 --> 58:48.474
You guys look great.

58:48.476 --> 58:50.140
Your skin
has such a lovely glow.

58:50.143 --> 58:51.876
Have you all been
tanning lately or something?

58:51.878 --> 58:54.112
We were fired.

58:57.652 --> 58:59.783
Out of a volcano.

58:59.785 --> 59:02.021
Oh! Right, right, right.

59:02.023 --> 59:03.621
Yeah, but other than that,
you're well?

59:03.623 --> 59:05.156
Uh, Garmadon,

59:05.159 --> 59:09.094
did you fire all of these
generals out of a volcano?

59:09.096 --> 59:11.796
No! Not all at the same time.

59:11.799 --> 59:14.366
Don't worry. These guys
are like family. They love me.

59:14.368 --> 59:17.036
Right, Generals?

59:17.038 --> 59:20.639
Oh, we're family all right.

59:20.641 --> 59:21.808
Ninja, go!

59:21.810 --> 59:22.875
Guys, wait!

59:22.877 --> 59:24.677
We need to use
our ninja powers.

59:24.679 --> 59:27.146
What do we do? We're worthless
without our mechs.

59:27.148 --> 59:29.446
Come on. Remember
what Master Wu told us.

59:29.448 --> 59:32.217
Nya, you can make a flood
to wash these guys outta here.

59:32.219 --> 59:33.585
The only hope
for water is

59:33.587 --> 59:35.020
if Jay has another accident
in his pants.

59:35.022 --> 59:37.121
Yeah, she's right.
We gotta get outta here!

59:37.123 --> 59:38.556
- Ow, that hurts.
- Let's go.

59:38.558 --> 59:40.725
No, no, guys.
Use your elemental powers.

59:40.727 --> 59:44.465
We have the power!

59:46.367 --> 59:48.634
<i>We've got Garmadon</i>

59:48.636 --> 59:50.869
<i>And this random kid</i>

59:50.871 --> 59:53.005
<i>We are going to kill them</i>

59:53.007 --> 59:55.273
<i>Oops, we shouldn't have
said that</i>

59:55.275 --> 59:57.342
I command you
to release me and my son.

59:57.344 --> 59:58.944
That's an order, Generals.

59:58.946 --> 01:00:00.445
I can't hear you!

01:00:00.447 --> 01:00:03.248
I said, I command you
to release me and my son.

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:06.050
Hey, the reason
Bob can't hear

01:00:06.052 --> 01:00:07.585
is 'cause
his eardrums blew up

01:00:07.587 --> 01:00:09.954
after you shot him
out of the volcano!

01:00:09.956 --> 01:00:11.590
I can't hear you!

01:00:11.592 --> 01:00:12.758
You stupid butt!

01:00:12.761 --> 01:00:15.194
What? Can you believe
what they're saying?

01:00:15.196 --> 01:00:16.829
It's like I'm being treated
worse than anyone

01:00:16.831 --> 01:00:18.063
in the history of the world.

01:00:18.065 --> 01:00:19.397
A good thing you never have to

01:00:19.399 --> 01:00:21.166
experience anything
like this, La-Loyd.

01:00:21.168 --> 01:00:24.103
Yeah. Yeah. No one ever says
mean things to me

01:00:24.105 --> 01:00:27.239
when my dad knocks over
their Pilates studio,

01:00:27.241 --> 01:00:30.476
or their waxing salon,
or their kayak repair store,

01:00:30.478 --> 01:00:32.578
or that place
that sells toner cartridges.

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.248
And you better believe
no one ever makes fun of me,

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.550
for not knowing
how to throw or catch a ball.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:40.652
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

01:00:40.654 --> 01:00:42.419
I know it's funny,
but what kind of jerk

01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:43.688
would make fun of you
for that?

01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:44.891
You're kidding, right?

01:00:44.893 --> 01:00:46.224
You gotta stand up
for yourself,

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:47.559
and shoot them out
of a volcano.

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:48.661
That's how I roll.

01:00:48.663 --> 01:00:50.728
You gotta get yourself
a volcano, kid.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.333
Yeah.

01:00:52.967 --> 01:00:54.199
Blowing stuff up

01:00:54.201 --> 01:00:57.136
and never putting it
back together.

01:00:57.138 --> 01:01:00.241
That is what you're best at,
isn't it?

01:01:03.545 --> 01:01:04.844
Well, hello!

01:01:04.846 --> 01:01:07.444
We have got a present for you.

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:10.016
Fire him! Fire him! Fire him!

01:01:10.018 --> 01:01:12.684
Oh, an exact reproduction
of my volcanic lair.

01:01:12.686 --> 01:01:13.718
And let me guess,

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.353
you're going to fire us
out of it.

01:01:15.355 --> 01:01:19.192
Oh, no, we're gonna fire you
into the volcano.

01:01:19.194 --> 01:01:22.061
The 15 million kelvin magma
will melt your skin

01:01:22.063 --> 01:01:23.862
before you can even feel
the heat!

01:01:23.864 --> 01:01:26.666
Omar, take them to the top.

01:01:26.668 --> 01:01:27.898
Okey-dokey.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.670
Up you go!

01:01:36.177 --> 01:01:39.645
Whoa.

01:01:39.647 --> 01:01:40.846
What is that?

01:01:40.848 --> 01:01:42.681
- Hey!
- What's up?

01:01:44.118 --> 01:01:45.650
Zane! Are you okay?

01:01:45.652 --> 01:01:47.719
I think I might be
an adrenaline junkie.

01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:49.454
I got you, dude!
I got you!

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.122
I really could've walked out
by myself,

01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:53.124
but thank you. Ow!

01:01:53.127 --> 01:01:55.059
Wait, where's Lloyd?

01:01:55.061 --> 01:01:56.695
- Um...
- Uh...

01:01:56.697 --> 01:01:58.096
Oh, no.

01:01:58.098 --> 01:02:00.266
I can't believe we just ran
off and left him back there.

01:02:00.268 --> 01:02:01.366
This is terrible.

01:02:01.368 --> 01:02:03.101
We are horrible friends.

01:02:03.103 --> 01:02:05.136
And sub-par ninjas, too.

01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:06.505
That's right. That's right.

01:02:06.507 --> 01:02:08.741
Wait. Guys...

01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:11.811
Fire him! Fire him!

01:02:11.813 --> 01:02:13.545
- Um...
- Oh, no!

01:02:13.547 --> 01:02:14.447
Lloyd!

01:02:14.449 --> 01:02:16.114
- He's in trouble.
- Oh, man.

01:02:16.116 --> 01:02:17.250
What are we going to do?

01:02:17.252 --> 01:02:18.851
We can still do this, guys.

01:02:18.853 --> 01:02:22.355
We just gotta figure out
how to be real ninjas.

01:02:22.357 --> 01:02:24.055
You know what would be
really brave?

01:02:24.057 --> 01:02:25.690
Making camp,
sleeping for the night,

01:02:25.692 --> 01:02:26.824
wake up in the day.

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:28.293
Yeah, that's brave.

01:02:28.295 --> 01:02:30.695
Wait, Zane, don't you have,
like, 700 gigabytes

01:02:30.697 --> 01:02:32.565
of martial arts movies
on your hard drive?

01:02:34.368 --> 01:02:36.000
- Correct!
- Great! Roll 'em.

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:37.636
<i>Zane's
Martial Arts Movie Club.</i>

01:02:37.638 --> 01:02:39.570

01:02:39.572 --> 01:02:41.273

- The Mainframe.</i>

01:02:46.647 --> 01:02:48.146
<i>- Caffeinated Master.
- Hip Man.</i>

01:02:48.148 --> 01:02:49.215
<i>Judo Future Boy.</i>

<i>Locke Two: The Joy Locke Club.</i>

01:02:50.518 --> 01:02:51.849
<i>I Told You
You're Wasting Your Time</i>

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:53.585
<i>I Vowed To Give Up
That Way Of Life.</i>

01:02:53.587 --> 01:02:55.054
<i>- Look Who's Punching.
- Look Who's Punching Too.</i>

01:02:55.056 --> 01:02:56.554
- Whoa!
- Ay, ay, ay!

01:02:56.556 --> 01:02:59.391
I learned so many things
so fast.

01:02:59.393 --> 01:03:00.858
- That's right. That's right.
- I'm ready.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.194
Time to get down and dirty.
Ninja style.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.717
- Oh, yeah.
- Right!

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:13.271
Whoa, is that a whale?

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:18.146
Guys, no swimming.
We just ate!

01:03:24.817 --> 01:03:26.750
Time to blend in.

01:03:33.694 --> 01:03:37.132
Fire him! Fire him! Fire him!

01:03:44.938 --> 01:03:46.739
La-Loyd...

01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:47.809
Yeah.

01:03:48.609 --> 01:03:50.476
Um... I...

01:03:50.478 --> 01:03:52.076
I just...

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:53.612
- Lloyd!
- Guys!

01:03:53.614 --> 01:03:54.746
Oh, hey!

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.513
Oh, my gosh!
How did you all get up here?

01:03:56.516 --> 01:03:58.384
Oh, man.
We did all that stuff

01:03:58.386 --> 01:04:00.151
that you and Master Wu
told us to do.

01:04:00.154 --> 01:04:01.253
Ninja style, bro.

01:04:01.255 --> 01:04:02.419
Whoa!

01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:03.922
All right.
Let's get outta here

01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:05.824
and make it to
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

01:04:05.826 --> 01:04:07.792
That's not gonna be easy,
girl ninja.

01:04:07.795 --> 01:04:10.529
Because I fired
a ridic amount of generals.

01:04:10.531 --> 01:04:11.896
All right, all right.
I got an idea.

01:04:11.898 --> 01:04:14.299
If we can hold these
generals off long enough,

01:04:14.301 --> 01:04:15.733
we can build a way
out of here.

01:04:15.735 --> 01:04:17.603
Great idea.
You kids start building.

01:04:17.605 --> 01:04:19.204
La-Loyd and I will
throw you bricks.

01:04:19.206 --> 01:04:21.139
Lloyd, I need a two-by-two.

01:04:21.141 --> 01:04:22.741
Here it comes.

01:04:22.743 --> 01:04:23.608
That was terrible.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.110
Throw me a couple one-bys.

01:04:25.112 --> 01:04:27.179
I got it. Check this out.

01:04:27.181 --> 01:04:28.547
How can you be so bad at this?

01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:30.080
Yeah. You got a mental block?

01:04:30.082 --> 01:04:31.550
Hang on, everybody.

01:04:31.552 --> 01:04:32.716
You ninjas, keep at it.

01:04:32.718 --> 01:04:34.084
La-Loyd, you're coming
with me.

01:04:34.086 --> 01:04:35.420
I'll be in charge
of the tunes.

01:04:35.422 --> 01:04:36.855
I'll just put it
on shuffle here.

01:04:36.857 --> 01:04:38.690
Please not Jim Croce,
please not Jim Croce.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.159
Ah! Jinxed us. Whatever.

01:04:41.161 --> 01:04:42.962
All right!
Ninjas, keep building!

01:04:42.964 --> 01:04:45.163
La-Loyd, I'm gonna teach you
how to throw.

01:04:58.645 --> 01:04:59.680
Come on!

01:05:03.518 --> 01:05:05.619
- Nya, look alive!
- Thank you.

01:05:09.357 --> 01:05:10.456
Yeah!

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:16.261
Run for it.

01:05:20.067 --> 01:05:22.233
Lloyd!
Over here, I'm open.

01:05:22.235 --> 01:05:24.401
Okay. All right.
I can do this.

01:05:24.403 --> 01:05:26.605
Quiet your mind, La-Loyd.

01:05:26.607 --> 01:05:28.005
Okay.

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:30.710
Throw like no one's watching
except your judging father.

01:05:30.712 --> 01:05:31.675
Not helping.

01:05:31.677 --> 01:05:34.616
Oh, right.
You got this. Do it.

01:05:39.186 --> 01:05:40.987
- Ha! La-Loyd.
- Yes!

01:05:40.989 --> 01:05:42.654
Look at that.
I actually taught you

01:05:42.656 --> 01:05:44.222
- how to do something.
- Right?

01:05:44.224 --> 01:05:46.156
- Nice! Dude, that was awesome!
- You did it, Lloyd!

01:05:46.159 --> 01:05:47.424
Cole, catch.

01:05:47.426 --> 01:05:49.395
- Kai.
- Right here, I'm open!

01:05:49.397 --> 01:05:50.561
- Great throw.
- Give me another. Quick!

01:05:50.563 --> 01:05:52.931
Zane, your turn, buddy.

01:05:52.933 --> 01:05:54.032
Whoa!

01:05:54.034 --> 01:05:55.733
<i>You've got
a cannon for an arm.</i>

01:05:55.735 --> 01:05:57.304
<i>Seriously,
an awesome throw.</i>

01:06:01.842 --> 01:06:03.775
La-Loyd, something's
happening to my face.

01:06:03.777 --> 01:06:05.878
It's turning upwards
in an unfamiliar motion.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.545
Oh, I think they've deployed
nerve gas!

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:09.380
It's happening to you, too!

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:11.951
Listen, listen. We're smiling!

01:06:11.953 --> 01:06:14.319
What is this "smiling"?

01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:16.288
Go with it!
It feels good, right?

01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:17.588
It does.

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:19.424
Oh, this whole experience
is so foreign to me.

01:06:19.426 --> 01:06:21.125
- I know, right?
- Yeah!

01:06:21.127 --> 01:06:23.161
All right, here it comes.

01:06:23.163 --> 01:06:24.262
La-Loyd!

01:06:30.705 --> 01:06:32.738
Time to fire you out...

01:06:33.873 --> 01:06:35.005
La-Loyd!

01:06:37.377 --> 01:06:38.677
La-Loyd, are you okay?

01:06:38.679 --> 01:06:40.011
Yeah, yeah!
I think it was my arm.

01:06:40.013 --> 01:06:40.913
Is it bad?

01:06:40.915 --> 01:06:42.346
- Whoa!
- I don't wanna look!

01:06:42.348 --> 01:06:45.317
It looks okay, I guess.

01:06:45.319 --> 01:06:47.184
Scale of one to 10,
how bad is it?

01:06:47.186 --> 01:06:48.587
Oh, I'd say it's about

01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:51.290
a seven-point...
Arm-ripped-off.

01:06:51.292 --> 01:06:53.425
My arm is what? What did...
Say it one more time?

01:06:53.427 --> 01:06:54.525
Just, don't look down.

01:06:54.527 --> 01:06:55.994
Don't look down
below your neck.

01:06:55.996 --> 01:06:57.561
Don't do that face.
Why are you doing that face?

01:06:57.563 --> 01:07:00.632
It's just a harmless little...

01:07:00.634 --> 01:07:02.499
I gotta puke. It's disgusting.

01:07:02.502 --> 01:07:03.802
Should I look?

01:07:03.804 --> 01:07:06.603
I looked! I have no arm!
I have no arm! No!

01:07:06.605 --> 01:07:07.838
I told you it was bad.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.541
Ah! That's way worse
than anything

01:07:09.543 --> 01:07:10.909
I could have thought!
That's bad!

01:07:10.911 --> 01:07:12.844
You're gonna be fine.
Let me text your mother.

01:07:12.846 --> 01:07:14.913
Dad, no! I need you!
Stay with me!

01:07:14.915 --> 01:07:17.516
Be here with me right now,
all right? Do something.

01:07:17.518 --> 01:07:19.417
All right, I'm gonna find it.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:20.951
What does it look like?

01:07:20.953 --> 01:07:24.188
It looks like my left arm,
except it's the right one.

01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:25.255
Oh, of course, yes.

01:07:25.257 --> 01:07:26.491
Okay, everybody, fan out,

01:07:26.493 --> 01:07:27.826
form a grid.
Find La-Loyd's arm.

01:07:27.828 --> 01:07:29.360
It's got a little hand
like a cup holder

01:07:29.362 --> 01:07:32.162
and a black sleeve and
a little piece of green on it.

01:07:32.165 --> 01:07:33.465
You'll know it
when you see it.

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:35.467
It's La-Loyd's arm,
for heaven's sake.

01:07:35.469 --> 01:07:36.867
- Does this look like it?
- No.

01:07:36.869 --> 01:07:38.402
All right,
let's try this arm out.

01:07:38.404 --> 01:07:39.672
That's a leg.

01:07:39.674 --> 01:07:41.105
Have you ever had
an arm that kicks?

01:07:41.107 --> 01:07:43.474
- I mean, that could be cool.
- Can't say I have.

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.177
Hey, how about this one?

01:07:45.179 --> 01:07:47.579
That's a sword.
That's a sword!

01:07:47.581 --> 01:07:49.648
Oh, man, to have a sword arm,
that'd be sweet!

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.583
You know, the idea of it

01:07:51.585 --> 01:07:53.686
is a lot cooler
than the reality.

01:07:53.688 --> 01:07:56.353
Oh, oh, wait...
Wait a minute. Found it!

01:07:56.355 --> 01:07:58.190
- Here we go!
- Okay.

01:07:58.192 --> 01:08:00.492
I'm gonna pop that arm
back into place.

01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:01.761
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

01:08:01.763 --> 01:08:03.594
But it's only gonna hurt
for a second, right?

01:08:03.596 --> 01:08:04.962
Hurt for a second? No!

01:08:04.964 --> 01:08:06.597
This is gonna be agony
for a while.

01:08:06.599 --> 01:08:07.800
Who gave you
that misinformation?

01:08:07.802 --> 01:08:09.067
All right, all right,
all right.

01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:10.268
Just do it, just do it,
just do it.

01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:12.637
Okay. On the count of 12...

01:08:12.639 --> 01:08:14.340
No, no, no, no.
I don't wanna do 12.

01:08:14.342 --> 01:08:16.506
Let's do... Let's do, like,
a, you know, three.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:19.044
Okay, three.

01:08:19.046 --> 01:08:20.109
One,

01:08:20.112 --> 01:08:21.545
two...

01:08:21.546 --> 01:08:23.080
Ah! I wish your mom
was here to do this.

01:08:23.082 --> 01:08:25.149
You're killing me. You got...
You gotta just do it.

01:08:25.152 --> 01:08:27.251
All right. One,

01:08:27.252 --> 01:08:28.456
two,

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:29.890
three.

01:08:31.256 --> 01:08:32.825
Wow.

01:08:32.827 --> 01:08:34.024
It, uh...

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:35.660
Feels, uh...

01:08:35.662 --> 01:08:37.127
It feels pretty good.

01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:39.932
Feels pretty good.

01:08:39.934 --> 01:08:43.102
You did that,
put my arm back on

01:08:43.104 --> 01:08:45.036
like a real dad.

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:46.370
You...

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:47.974
You called me "Dad."

01:08:48.442 --> 01:08:49.506
Yeah.

01:08:49.509 --> 01:08:52.111
Wow! I guess I...
I guess I did.

01:08:52.113 --> 01:08:55.046
I really stepped up there
in kind of a "Dad" way.

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:56.145
Right?

01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:58.549
Lloyd, come on!
We gotta get outta here!

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.517
- Come on!
- Run! Run!

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.020
Guys, we have to go.

01:09:02.022 --> 01:09:04.656
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Come on!

01:09:04.658 --> 01:09:05.990
Let's get moving.

01:09:05.992 --> 01:09:07.511
Come on, everybody, let's go!

01:09:08.662 --> 01:09:09.928
I can't believe
it worked.

01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:12.533
Temple, here we come!

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:15.700
Hey, La-Loyd,

01:09:15.702 --> 01:09:16.901
let me show you
how to fly this thing.

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:19.169
Hands, 10 and two.

01:09:19.171 --> 01:09:21.973
I build and drive mechs
all the time.

01:09:21.975 --> 01:09:23.073
I think I'm good.

01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:26.247
Oh. Okay. Yeah,
you're probably right.

01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:32.049
Um... What, uh...

01:09:32.051 --> 01:09:34.718
What were you saying?
10 and...

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.254
- Oh, two! 10 and two.
- Two. Two.

01:09:36.256 --> 01:09:37.721
- Yeah, just 10 and two.
- Okay, all right, all right.

01:09:37.724 --> 01:09:38.956
That's kind of a rule of thumb

01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:40.158
- in driving.
- That's good to know.

01:09:40.161 --> 01:09:41.559
And don't forget
to check your rear-view.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.761
You wanna see
what's back there.

01:09:42.763 --> 01:09:43.661
You have blind spots
everywhere.

01:09:43.662 --> 01:09:44.795
Rear-view, check.

01:09:44.796 --> 01:09:46.031
Keep your eyes peeled.

01:09:46.033 --> 01:09:47.298
You really wanna be
looking ahead.

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.367
Noted, thank you.

01:09:49.368 --> 01:09:50.832
You want me to really
open this thing up?

01:09:50.836 --> 01:09:52.871
Sure. Yeah,
let's see what it can do.

01:09:52.872 --> 01:09:54.005
Okay.

01:09:55.242 --> 01:09:56.340
Yeah!

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.713
Okay, that's enough!

01:10:01.715 --> 01:10:03.014
- That's too fast.
- You didn't like that?

01:10:03.016 --> 01:10:04.182
I mean, I liked it.
If I was driving,

01:10:04.184 --> 01:10:05.816
- I would be fine with it.
- Sure, sure.

01:10:05.818 --> 01:10:07.585
Right. I felt a little scared.
Were you scared?

01:10:07.587 --> 01:10:09.119
Um, yeah. I'm not gonna lie,

01:10:09.121 --> 01:10:10.989
I might need
a change of armor.

01:10:10.991 --> 01:10:12.557
I want you to guard

01:10:12.559 --> 01:10:13.625
the brake a little bit.

01:10:13.627 --> 01:10:15.194
Okay, okay, got it, got it.

01:10:15.196 --> 01:10:17.696
You're doing great, buddy,
this is going real... Goat!

01:10:17.698 --> 01:10:20.131
Goat, goat, goat!

01:10:39.519 --> 01:10:40.751
Is everyone okay?

01:10:40.753 --> 01:10:42.187
- Not really.
- Huh?

01:10:43.523 --> 01:10:48.325
Behold, the Temple
of Fragile Foundations.

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:53.797
The helicopter crash has
destabilized the entire area.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.099
And I'm not blaming anyone,

01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:56.567
but if I ever see
that goat again,

01:10:56.569 --> 01:10:57.870
he and I are gonna have words.

01:10:57.872 --> 01:10:58.937
And you can bet
some of those words

01:10:58.939 --> 01:11:00.169
are gonna have four letters.

01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:01.876
And I'm not talking
about "goat."

01:11:02.809 --> 01:11:04.578
Give us the first letter.

01:11:09.382 --> 01:11:12.150
This is my new least
favorite place I've ever been.

01:11:12.152 --> 01:11:15.754
I've spent a lot
of time here, and trust me,

01:11:15.756 --> 01:11:17.388
doesn't get any better.

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:22.061
Wait a minute.
So, you know this place?

01:11:22.063 --> 01:11:23.797
Who doesn't know

01:11:26.233 --> 01:11:27.731
their childhood home?

01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:31.870
Yeah, this place
is so unstable

01:11:31.872 --> 01:11:34.709
I had to move to a volcano
just to feel safe.

01:11:36.175 --> 01:11:38.044
Well, shall we?

01:11:42.916 --> 01:11:44.114
Stay close.

01:11:44.116 --> 01:11:45.584
I will lead you
through this perilous...

01:11:45.586 --> 01:11:47.285
Oh, look, a light switch.

01:11:47.287 --> 01:11:48.785
Do you guys have
a bathroom I could use?

01:11:48.787 --> 01:11:49.852
Nope.

01:11:49.855 --> 01:11:51.188
Fresh fruit!

01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:53.023
- Finally, food!
- I'm starving!

01:11:53.025 --> 01:11:54.593
Ow! I think I chipped a tooth.

01:11:54.595 --> 01:11:56.661
Yeah, my parents were really
into plastic fruit.

01:11:56.663 --> 01:11:58.464
Whoa! Check out
those old photos.

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:01.598
Look at that!

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.535
<i>Aw! They're so cute!</i>

01:12:03.537 --> 01:12:05.102
<i>Look at his baby goatee!</i>

01:12:05.104 --> 01:12:08.272
<i>I mean, Master Wu
looks like a really old man.</i>

01:12:08.274 --> 01:12:11.375
<i>He even
schooled you back then.</i>

01:12:11.377 --> 01:12:12.910
Whatevz.

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:14.612
Come on, let's go find
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

01:12:14.614 --> 01:12:15.815
Wait.

01:12:17.516 --> 01:12:19.153
That's... That's you.

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.218
And that's...

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.588
<i>It's Lady Iron Dragon,</i>

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:24.955
my hero!

01:12:24.957 --> 01:12:27.892
Yes, Lady Iron Dragon,

01:12:27.894 --> 01:12:30.896
aka La-Loyd's mom.

01:12:30.898 --> 01:12:32.464
Wait, what?

01:12:32.466 --> 01:12:33.998
Mom was a ninja?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.531
<i>That's right.</i>

01:12:35.534 --> 01:12:38.402
She was the most awesome
ninja warrior I'd ever seen.

01:12:38.404 --> 01:12:42.106
I remember the first time
I laid eyes on her.

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:43.976
<i>It was during a raging war.</i>

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:46.745
<i>I was pillaging
a peaceful village</i>

01:12:46.747 --> 01:12:48.213
<i>with my skeleton army</i>

01:12:48.215 --> 01:12:50.781
<i>when I spotted this beautiful
warrior queen</i>

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:53.151
<i>from across
a crowded battlefield.</i>

01:12:53.153 --> 01:12:56.955
<i>She was fighting for good
and looking great doing it.</i>

01:12:56.957 --> 01:13:00.091
<i>Even as she decimated
my evil forces,</i>

01:13:00.094 --> 01:13:02.761
<i>I couldn't take
my eyes off her.</i>

01:13:02.763 --> 01:13:05.230
<i>I was speechless.</i>

01:13:05.232 --> 01:13:08.432
<i>I summoned all my courage
to approach her.</i>

01:13:08.434 --> 01:13:11.369
<i>I asked her
if she fought here often.</i>

01:13:11.371 --> 01:13:14.374
<i>She said, "I do."</i>

01:13:15.509 --> 01:13:17.241
<i>And let me tell you, La-Loyd.</i>

01:13:17.243 --> 01:13:20.081
<i>When our eyes met,
sparks flew.</i>

01:13:23.583 --> 01:13:27.888
<i>It was love at first fight!</i>

01:13:29.256 --> 01:13:32.624
<i>Your mother and I
were a true power couple.</i>

01:13:32.626 --> 01:13:36.261
<i>I thought we were gonna
conquer the world together.</i>

01:13:42.434 --> 01:13:46.036
<i>It was the happiest
time of my life.</i>

01:13:46.038 --> 01:13:47.606
<i>Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.</i>

01:13:47.608 --> 01:13:51.345
If you guys were so perfect,
then why did you leave us?

01:13:52.777 --> 01:13:54.147
It's...

01:13:55.282 --> 01:13:56.751
Complicated.

01:13:59.987 --> 01:14:02.456
<i>One day, we came upon NINJAGO.</i>

01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:06.490
<i>I told your mother</i>

01:14:06.492 --> 01:14:08.058
<i>that I wanted to build
our son's future</i>

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:11.031
<i>on the ashes
of that fine city.</i>

01:14:13.266 --> 01:14:16.533
<i>But it was at that moment
that your mother realized...</i>

01:14:18.604 --> 01:14:21.207
<i>...that the life
of a conquering warlord...</i>

01:14:24.177 --> 01:14:26.113
<i>...was not the life
she wanted...</i>

01:14:29.983 --> 01:14:31.918
<i>For you.</i>

01:14:34.988 --> 01:14:37.091
I could've changed.

01:15:01.881 --> 01:15:04.150
But I didn't.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.496
<i>And before I knew it...</i>

01:15:19.733 --> 01:15:21.302
<i>She was gone...</i>

01:15:23.768 --> 01:15:25.438
<i>And you were gone.</i>

01:15:42.787 --> 01:15:46.259
La-Loyd,
your mom was the best.

01:15:47.161 --> 01:15:50.128
She expected the best of me

01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:52.498
<i>and only ever wanted
the best for you.</i>

01:15:58.872 --> 01:16:01.475
I never should
have let you go.

01:16:03.943 --> 01:16:08.112
<i>Lloyd! We found
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon!</i>

01:16:08.114 --> 01:16:09.347
Here, in the bedroom!

01:16:09.349 --> 01:16:10.682
We think it's in that box.

01:16:10.684 --> 01:16:11.886
Open it, open it, open it!

01:16:13.921 --> 01:16:15.786
<i>Whoa!</i>

01:16:15.788 --> 01:16:17.422
<i>What a bunch of junk.</i>

01:16:17.424 --> 01:16:20.558
Maybe there's something
important under it.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.794
<i>This is the Ultimate
Ultimate Disappointment.</i>

01:16:22.796 --> 01:16:24.529
- Correct.
- No. Wait.

01:16:24.531 --> 01:16:27.499
There's a piece for each
of our elements.

01:16:27.501 --> 01:16:28.903
Fire.

01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:32.038
Whoa!

01:16:32.906 --> 01:16:34.705
And earth.

01:16:34.707 --> 01:16:36.374
This rocks!

01:16:36.376 --> 01:16:40.678
- And water.
- H-2, oh yeah!

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.980
And ice.

01:16:41.982 --> 01:16:43.781
Cool.

01:16:43.783 --> 01:16:45.382
<i>And lightning.</i>

01:16:45.384 --> 01:16:46.552
Ah!

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:51.755
And I'm... Green.

01:16:51.757 --> 01:16:54.825
But I'm so happy for you guys.

01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:57.497
Yay.

01:16:59.099 --> 01:17:00.464
You know, La-Loyd,

01:17:00.466 --> 01:17:02.766
after spending
all this time with you,

01:17:02.768 --> 01:17:05.536
seeing the amazing ninja
warrior you've become...

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:06.605
Yeah?

01:17:06.607 --> 01:17:08.373
You know, I've realized

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:10.741
that we don't need
to fight each other

01:17:10.743 --> 01:17:12.775
when we can fight
alongside each other.

01:17:12.777 --> 01:17:13.844
Really?

01:17:13.846 --> 01:17:16.013
Yeah.

01:17:16.015 --> 01:17:20.150
La-Loyd, will you go back
to NINJAGO with me

01:17:20.153 --> 01:17:22.754
as father...

01:17:22.756 --> 01:17:25.723
...and General Number One?

01:17:25.725 --> 01:17:27.592
Wait, what? You...

01:17:27.594 --> 01:17:29.660
You're General Number One?

01:17:29.662 --> 01:17:31.427
Exactly!

01:17:31.429 --> 01:17:34.766
But... But you just said how
you regretted letting me go.

01:17:34.768 --> 01:17:37.634
Because you'd make the perfect
General Number One.

01:17:37.636 --> 01:17:40.105
We're an amazing team,
La-Loyd.

01:17:40.107 --> 01:17:42.839
You, me,
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

01:17:42.841 --> 01:17:44.308
We'd be unstoppable.

01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:47.910
No. I don't wanna be
your General Number One.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:52.016
But just imagine it.
We can rule NINJAGO, together.

01:17:52.018 --> 01:17:53.651
Come with me, La-Loyd.

01:17:53.653 --> 01:17:56.453
We have so much lost time
to make up for!

01:17:56.455 --> 01:17:58.289
And since I'll no longer
be attacking the city,

01:17:58.291 --> 01:17:59.657
no one will hate you anymore.

01:17:59.659 --> 01:18:01.258
And I'll never forget
your birthday again

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.593
because we'll celebrate
your birthday every day!

01:18:03.595 --> 01:18:06.297
And think of all the things
I could teach you.

01:18:06.299 --> 01:18:09.565
Tie a tie, ride a bike,
conquer a city.

01:18:09.568 --> 01:18:11.436
And if we leave now,
we can unleash

01:18:11.438 --> 01:18:13.237
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon
on Meowthra

01:18:13.239 --> 01:18:15.307
and conquer NINJAGO together.
Come on!

01:18:15.309 --> 01:18:17.409
Dad, please don't.

01:18:18.644 --> 01:18:21.279
Come back to NINJAGO with me
and save the city.

01:18:21.281 --> 01:18:22.879
- What?
- You'll be a hero.

01:18:22.881 --> 01:18:24.748
But that's not who I am,
La-Loyd.

01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:26.450
People would never
see me as a hero.

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:29.788
But it doesn't
have to be this way.

01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:32.423
This is your chance
to make a change.

01:18:32.425 --> 01:18:34.593
I didn't want it to be
this way either,

01:18:34.595 --> 01:18:35.859
but here we are.

01:18:35.862 --> 01:18:38.795
Dad, please, don't go.

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:41.230
If I couldn't change then,

01:18:41.233 --> 01:18:44.001
what makes you think
I could change now?

01:18:44.003 --> 01:18:45.203
No, no.

01:18:45.205 --> 01:18:46.469
- Stop!
- No, no, no!

01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:48.138
- Back off!
- No way!

01:18:48.141 --> 01:18:50.107
Hey, that's my sister!

01:18:50.109 --> 01:18:52.175
- Get off my face!
- Bam!

01:18:52.177 --> 01:18:53.878
- I got it!
- Give that back!

01:18:55.448 --> 01:18:57.648
I can help you.
We can do it together.

01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:00.218
If you just give me the box,
we can talk about it.

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:03.120
I can't.
You'll just leave.

01:19:03.122 --> 01:19:04.923
- I got it!
- Look out!

01:19:04.925 --> 01:19:07.258
- Cole!
- Gotcha! Nice try.

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.861
We're like
the Harlem Globetrotters.

01:19:09.863 --> 01:19:11.361
Hey!

01:19:11.363 --> 01:19:12.931
- Over here, over here!
- Get outta my way.

01:19:12.933 --> 01:19:14.163
Lloyd, catch it!

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:15.833
<i>- Run, Lloyd! Run!</i>
- I got it!

01:19:15.835 --> 01:19:17.302
I got it! I got it!

01:19:17.304 --> 01:19:18.870
<i>Predictable but regrettable.</i>

01:19:18.872 --> 01:19:20.070
Bummer.

01:19:20.072 --> 01:19:22.342
Oh, La-Loyd.

01:19:23.976 --> 01:19:25.179
Dad.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.147
I should have taught you
how to catch.

01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:31.185
No!

01:19:43.630 --> 01:19:45.364
So long, La-Loyd.

01:19:55.707 --> 01:19:58.375
Get outta the way! This whole
thing is coming down!

01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:00.378
We don't have those pieces.

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.245
Yeah, and we don't
even have our mechs.

01:20:02.247 --> 01:20:03.781
We're doomed!

01:20:03.783 --> 01:20:05.349
- Oh, no! We're gonna die.
- What do we do?

01:20:05.351 --> 01:20:09.352
<i>Our chances
of survival are 0.00...</i>

01:20:09.354 --> 01:20:12.758
Stay on the right path
to find your inner peace.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.195
Did he say inner peace?

01:20:19.533 --> 01:20:22.365
<i>The power is inside you.</i>

01:20:22.367 --> 01:20:25.236
<i>The power is inside you.</i>

01:20:25.238 --> 01:20:27.773
<i>The power is inside you.</i>

01:20:34.281 --> 01:20:35.612
Inner peace?

01:20:35.614 --> 01:20:38.115
<i>Find your inner peace.</i>

01:20:38.117 --> 01:20:39.651
Inner peace! Inner piece!

01:20:39.653 --> 01:20:41.951
Guys. Guys, we don't
need those pieces.

01:20:41.953 --> 01:20:45.755
The Ultimate Ultimate Weapon
is inside of you.

01:20:45.757 --> 01:20:49.326
- What?
- Yes, you have the power.

01:20:49.328 --> 01:20:50.895
<i>Look within.</i>

01:20:50.897 --> 01:20:54.130
Harness what you already have
inside and let it out.

01:20:54.132 --> 01:20:56.601
I believe in each of you.

01:20:56.603 --> 01:20:59.571
Nya, you can create water.

01:20:59.573 --> 01:21:01.805
Kai, you can make fire.

01:21:01.808 --> 01:21:03.673
Okay. All right.
I can make a fire.

01:21:03.675 --> 01:21:06.710
The power is inside
of all of you.

01:21:06.712 --> 01:21:08.978
Now, calm your mind.
Concentrate.

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:11.348
Build up your powers.

01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:15.352
Just think about earth,
fire, water, ice.

01:21:15.354 --> 01:21:18.388
And you, Jay, lightning, baby.
Do it!

01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:20.124
Jay, you got the power!

01:21:20.126 --> 01:21:22.526
Say, "I've got the power!"

01:21:22.528 --> 01:21:25.263
I've got the power!

01:21:29.434 --> 01:21:31.370
I've got the power.

01:21:32.573 --> 01:21:34.908
Good work, Cole.
Go, go, go!

01:21:36.376 --> 01:21:37.508
I've got the power.

01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:38.744
I too, have the power.

01:21:40.779 --> 01:21:42.549
Here we go.
Come on, hurry up.

01:21:44.083 --> 01:21:45.148
What now?

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:46.482
- Kai, your turn.
- Got it.

01:21:46.484 --> 01:21:47.753
I've got the power!

01:21:49.823 --> 01:21:51.692
I think I made it worse!

01:21:52.757 --> 01:21:54.290
<i>Jump, Lloyd. Jump.</i>

01:21:54.292 --> 01:21:56.160
Master Wu?

01:21:56.162 --> 01:21:58.463
Guys, I can hear the dead,

01:21:58.465 --> 01:22:02.433
and Master Wu says to jump!

01:22:09.074 --> 01:22:10.441
<i>Great jump, students.</i>

01:22:10.443 --> 01:22:12.477
Master Wu!

01:22:12.479 --> 01:22:13.611
You're alive!

01:22:13.613 --> 01:22:16.080
Of course.
I'm a ninja master

01:22:16.082 --> 01:22:17.581
who lives life on the edge

01:22:17.583 --> 01:22:19.282
and cheats death
at every turn.

01:22:19.284 --> 01:22:21.251
- Wow!
- Really?

01:22:21.253 --> 01:22:23.254
No. I thought being dead

01:22:23.256 --> 01:22:24.856
would make you listen
to me more.

01:22:24.858 --> 01:22:26.023
And I was right.

01:22:26.025 --> 01:22:28.158
Master Wu, we found
our elemental powers.

01:22:28.161 --> 01:22:30.426
All because Lloyd wouldn't
give up on our training.

01:22:30.428 --> 01:22:31.928
Lloyd saved us.

01:22:31.930 --> 01:22:34.665
He also decoded your
needlessly cryptic metaphors.

01:22:34.667 --> 01:22:36.968
Lloyd, I'm so proud of you.

01:22:36.970 --> 01:22:39.102
You helped your friends
be great.

01:22:39.104 --> 01:22:42.740
And that makes you
truly a ninja master.

01:22:42.742 --> 01:22:46.576
Now, let's go save the city
from the giant kitty.

01:22:46.578 --> 01:22:48.748
I second that!

01:22:50.617 --> 01:22:52.883
This cat
is destroying everything!

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.852
Where are the Ninjas
when we need them?

01:22:54.854 --> 01:22:56.890
We have to evacuate!

01:22:58.491 --> 01:22:59.656
Run! Run!

01:22:59.658 --> 01:23:01.492
Hey, NINJAGO,

01:23:01.494 --> 01:23:03.026
Garmadon's back!

01:23:03.028 --> 01:23:06.829
Generals, stop anyone
that gets in my way.

01:23:06.832 --> 01:23:08.066
Yes, sir.

01:23:09.903 --> 01:23:11.636
<i>Whoa,
it's the Destiny's Bounty.</i>

01:23:11.638 --> 01:23:13.036
<i>I've always wanted
to shoot at it.</i>

01:23:13.038 --> 01:23:14.272
Attack!

01:23:14.274 --> 01:23:15.976
<i>Alpha team, on it.</i>

01:23:17.176 --> 01:23:19.545
We have company.
Hold on tight.

01:23:23.815 --> 01:23:26.482
<i>Hey, where'd they go?</i>

01:23:26.484 --> 01:23:28.387
All right, Ninjas,
follow me.

01:23:31.957 --> 01:23:33.523
Ninja, go!

01:23:33.525 --> 01:23:34.994
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:23:36.762 --> 01:23:39.863
Nya, we need to get
to Garmadon and that cat fast.

01:23:39.866 --> 01:23:40.934
You got it.

01:23:44.134 --> 01:23:45.803
All right, you beast.

01:23:45.805 --> 01:23:49.574
Get ready to feel the wrath of
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

01:23:49.576 --> 01:23:50.708
Hmm?

01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:52.241
Here they come.

01:23:52.244 --> 01:23:53.544
Come on! Let's go!

01:23:53.546 --> 01:23:54.748
Follow Nya.

01:24:00.753 --> 01:24:02.922
Take that.

01:24:03.724 --> 01:24:04.725
What?

01:24:08.561 --> 01:24:10.564
- Zane, freeze these guys out.
- Copy.

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:14.231
Kai, make a smoke screen.

01:24:14.233 --> 01:24:16.801
Yeah, baby! <i>Fu-fu-fuego!</i>

01:24:18.872 --> 01:24:20.138
Where'd they go?

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:21.972
I can't see them anywhere.

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:25.011
Okay. Well, how about this?
Hyah!

01:24:25.845 --> 01:24:27.111
These things aren't working.

01:24:27.113 --> 01:24:28.913
Jay, now's your chance, buddy.

01:24:28.915 --> 01:24:29.981
Roger that.

01:24:39.425 --> 01:24:40.760
Let's rock!

01:24:46.466 --> 01:24:48.499
Hey, cat, back off!

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:49.933
I'm Garmadon, baby.

01:24:49.935 --> 01:24:51.268
I'm the greatest
warlord of all...

01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:53.736
Somebody help me!

01:24:53.738 --> 01:24:55.741
- Dad?
- Please!

01:24:57.208 --> 01:24:58.709
Go, ninjas, go!

01:24:58.711 --> 01:25:00.044
Hip hip hooray!

01:25:00.046 --> 01:25:01.612
The cat ate Garmadon!

01:25:01.614 --> 01:25:03.547
Now all we have to do
is take out the cat

01:25:03.549 --> 01:25:04.949
and NINJAGO is saved.

01:25:04.951 --> 01:25:06.817
- Get him!
- Take out that monster!

01:25:06.819 --> 01:25:09.420
Blast that cat
with your awesome hand powers.

01:25:09.422 --> 01:25:13.624
La-Loyd! Please help me!

01:25:13.626 --> 01:25:16.361
Oh, I can use my fire.
But is that too much?

01:25:16.363 --> 01:25:17.995
Or I could blast him
with my water.

01:25:17.997 --> 01:25:20.129
Cats hate water.

01:25:20.131 --> 01:25:21.635
You were right, Master Wu.

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:24.968
I need to walk the path

01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:27.205
that only the son of Garmadon
can walk.

01:25:32.244 --> 01:25:34.044
Oh, my gosh!

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:37.414
The Green Ninja
is Lloyd Garmadon?

01:25:37.416 --> 01:25:38.982
Lloyd.

01:25:38.984 --> 01:25:42.320
All we have to do is scare off
Meowthra and we've won.

01:25:42.322 --> 01:25:45.022
- No.
- What?

01:25:45.024 --> 01:25:46.155
Uh, Lloyd,

01:25:46.157 --> 01:25:47.825
where are you going?

01:25:48.728 --> 01:25:50.594
Lloyd? Come back.

01:25:53.198 --> 01:25:56.133
Here, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

01:26:01.407 --> 01:26:03.374
Yeah, come here.

01:26:03.376 --> 01:26:04.474
Lloyd, no!

01:26:04.476 --> 01:26:06.909
It's okay. He's got this.

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:09.847
<i>That's a good kitty.</i>

01:26:09.849 --> 01:26:13.953
You're okay.
Yeah, you're okay.

01:26:19.158 --> 01:26:22.593
Yeah, yeah,
that's a good kitty.

01:26:22.595 --> 01:26:25.866
What a sweet, sweet kitty.

01:26:27.567 --> 01:26:31.037
Everything's gonna be
just fine.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:34.737
Hey. I know it.

01:26:34.739 --> 01:26:37.610
I know it. You don't mean
to destroy everything.

01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:43.917
<i>When, uh...
When people look at you,</i>

01:26:44.649 --> 01:26:46.816
they see a monster.

01:26:50.089 --> 01:26:52.388
But I know that

01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:56.762
you just feel
scared and alone.

01:26:59.698 --> 01:27:02.133
<i>I know how that feels.</i>

01:27:04.603 --> 01:27:06.605
To be judged unfairly.

01:27:15.146 --> 01:27:20.753
So, um... I just wanna say
that I forgive you.

01:27:23.522 --> 01:27:24.890
<i>And...</i>

01:27:30.296 --> 01:27:31.731
I'm sorry.

01:27:33.232 --> 01:27:36.569
When I said "I wish
you weren't my father,"

01:27:38.304 --> 01:27:40.206
I didn't really mean it.

01:27:43.376 --> 01:27:46.075
<i>What I...
What I should've said is</i>

01:27:46.077 --> 01:27:52.482
I wish we didn't
fight all of the time.

01:27:52.484 --> 01:27:57.656
<i>I wish I could've
spent more time with you.</i>

01:27:58.757 --> 01:28:00.790
<i>And that you could've seen,</i>

01:28:00.792 --> 01:28:03.427
<i>like, everything
I've been through,</i>

01:28:03.429 --> 01:28:05.062
<i>but you weren't there.</i>

01:28:05.064 --> 01:28:09.333
<i>I wish we could get
that time back, and...</i>

01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:15.875
I need my dad.
I just... I need my dad.

01:28:27.418 --> 01:28:28.686
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

01:28:28.688 --> 01:28:30.321
Dad!

01:28:30.323 --> 01:28:32.822
- Are... Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:28:32.824 --> 01:28:34.193
You're alive!

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:36.393
Son?

01:28:36.395 --> 01:28:37.628
Yeah?

01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:41.400
Did you mean
all that stuff you said?

01:28:42.268 --> 01:28:43.766
To the cat?

01:28:43.768 --> 01:28:46.370
Every word.

01:28:46.372 --> 01:28:49.005
Well, I know for a fact

01:28:49.007 --> 01:28:52.476
that the cat feels exactly
the same way.

01:28:53.878 --> 01:28:57.414
Dad? Are you crying?

01:28:57.416 --> 01:28:59.115
No!

01:28:59.117 --> 01:29:03.388
It's just that
I'm kind of allergic to cats.

01:29:08.327 --> 01:29:09.660
- Lloyd!
- Mom!

01:29:09.662 --> 01:29:12.062
Let me look at you. Let me
look at you. Are you hurt?

01:29:12.064 --> 01:29:13.664
Let me see
your fingers and toes.

01:29:13.666 --> 01:29:16.901
Okay. You still don't have
fingers and toes. That's good.

01:29:16.903 --> 01:29:18.669
- Is everything okay?
- I'm... I'm fine. I'm good.

01:29:18.671 --> 01:29:20.603
Lloyd, I was
so worried about you.

01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:22.074
Mom. Mom, wait!

01:29:23.007 --> 01:29:24.473
I'm, uh... I'm sorry.

01:29:24.475 --> 01:29:25.642
It's okay. I'm just...

01:29:25.644 --> 01:29:27.143
I'm just so happy
you're all right.

01:29:27.145 --> 01:29:30.848
No. Mom, I'm really sorry.

01:29:30.850 --> 01:29:33.650
I took you for granted.

01:29:33.652 --> 01:29:35.989
All you ever did
was support me.

01:29:36.555 --> 01:29:38.187
The real me.

01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:42.026
The person I am on the inside.

01:29:42.028 --> 01:29:43.026
Oh.

01:29:43.028 --> 01:29:44.594
I'm really sorry, Mom.

01:29:44.596 --> 01:29:46.730
I love you so much.

01:29:46.732 --> 01:29:48.400
I love you, too.

01:29:49.702 --> 01:29:51.535
Bring it in.
Let's hug this out.

01:29:51.537 --> 01:29:53.870
Okay. That's cool. Uh...

01:29:53.872 --> 01:29:56.107
I found two people
to hug me over here.

01:29:57.844 --> 01:29:59.309
Uncle Wu,

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:02.647
I know why you wanted me
to be the Green Ninja.

01:30:02.649 --> 01:30:04.248
Oh, you do?

01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:05.452
Yeah.

01:30:06.519 --> 01:30:08.754
<i>Green is the color of life.</i>

01:30:09.855 --> 01:30:12.224
<i>It flows through
all living things,</i>

01:30:13.058 --> 01:30:15.258
<i>connecting them all.</i>

01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:17.263
<i>The way I connect the Ninjas.</i>

01:30:22.101 --> 01:30:23.334
Hi!

01:30:25.904 --> 01:30:30.040
<i>Or the way I connect
my family,</i>

01:30:30.042 --> 01:30:33.376
<i>whether we're together or not.</i>

01:30:33.378 --> 01:30:36.446
Some powers are ones
you cannot see,

01:30:36.448 --> 01:30:40.886
but those are the most
important powers of all.

01:30:43.889 --> 01:30:45.723
Lloyd was a hero.

01:30:45.725 --> 01:30:46.956
Who are you talking to?

01:30:46.958 --> 01:30:50.026
He saved Garmadon
and he saved his family.

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:51.195
We're standing right here.

01:30:51.197 --> 01:30:53.030
And the whole city of NINJAGO.

01:30:53.032 --> 01:30:54.298
Where are you going?

01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.965
They even made Meowthra
the mascot.

01:30:55.967 --> 01:30:58.000
She's so fluffy!
I love her.

01:30:58.002 --> 01:30:59.402
Wu, come back!

01:30:59.404 --> 01:31:01.839
<i>Koko and Nya
opened a school</i>

01:31:01.841 --> 01:31:05.540
<i>to teach former shark generals
life skills.</i>

01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:09.480
<i>And Garmadon taught Lloyd
something very important.</i>

01:31:09.482 --> 01:31:10.681
Hey, catch!

01:31:12.351 --> 01:31:14.383
Whoa.

01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:17.021
<i>And Lloyd taught everyone</i>

01:31:17.023 --> 01:31:19.156
that even if you're different,

01:31:19.158 --> 01:31:21.592
you can still do great things.

01:31:21.594 --> 01:31:22.692
Whoa!

01:31:22.694 --> 01:31:24.560
So does that mean
I'm a ninja now?

01:31:24.563 --> 01:31:26.129
No.

01:31:26.131 --> 01:31:28.633
All you did
was listen to a story.

01:31:28.635 --> 01:31:29.967
Doesn't make you
a martial artist.

01:31:29.969 --> 01:31:31.566
Or does it?

01:31:36.007 --> 01:31:37.409
Okay, okay, okay.

01:31:38.543 --> 01:31:41.145
Listen, to be a master,

01:31:41.147 --> 01:31:44.447
it takes patience,
hard work,

01:31:44.449 --> 01:31:47.587
courage, and...

01:31:50.555 --> 01:31:52.225
Whoa.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.328
Good.

01:31:58.797 --> 01:32:00.630
Your training begins at dawn.

01:32:00.632 --> 01:32:01.932
Whoa.

01:32:01.934 --> 01:32:03.666
Whoa.

01:32:03.668 --> 01:32:05.669
Can we bring the cat?

01:32:05.671 --> 01:32:06.736
No.

01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:18.281
Okay, kids.

01:32:18.283 --> 01:32:20.784
There's one last thing
I have to teach you ninjas.

01:32:20.786 --> 01:32:22.885
Get on your feet. You ready?

01:32:22.888 --> 01:32:25.856
Here comes the Dance of Doom.

01:35:19.931 --> 01:35:21.164
A mark.

01:35:21.166 --> 01:35:22.231
<i>Jackie Chan!</i>

01:35:22.234 --> 01:35:23.568
B mark.
