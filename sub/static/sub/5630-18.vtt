[tires squealing]

00:06.606 --> 00:09.008
- Get back!
Move back!

00:14.582 --> 00:17.416
Dispatch relayed
the witness heard screams

00:17.418 --> 00:19.785
- Store's quiet.
No gunshots since we got here.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.320
No movement,
no sign of hostages.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.055
Shooter might still be inside.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.456
- Thanks.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.592
Move in!
Stack it up.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.106
- Clear.
- Clear.

00:55.588 --> 00:57.089
- No.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.758
- Whatever's up there,
he died protecting it.

01:14.674 --> 01:17.443
Clear.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.213
[women screaming]
- Chicago police!

01:21.215 --> 01:22.314
I need to see everyone's hands!

01:22.316 --> 01:23.549
- Please!
Please don't shoot us!

01:23.551 --> 01:24.716
Don't shoot us!
- Are you okay?

01:24.718 --> 01:26.185
Is everybody okay?

01:26.187 --> 01:27.453
- Is he gone?

01:27.455 --> 01:28.654
- Who's he?
- I don't know.

01:28.656 --> 01:29.855
- Who's he?
Hey, come on out of there.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.423
Come on out of there.
It's okay, guys.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.392
It's okay.
- Gunshot wound!

01:33.394 --> 01:35.394
- 5021 Emergency.
<i>- Go ahead, 5021.</i>

01:35.396 --> 01:38.564
- We responded to that call
of shots fired.

01:38.566 --> 01:42.301
- Need you to roll ambulances
to 1950 South Throop.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.203
Multiple victims
of gunshot wounds.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.739
We'll put out a flash message
as soon as we can.

01:47.741 --> 01:51.543
- Sarge, offender's in the wind.
We got patrol looking for him.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.544
<i>- Copy that.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

01:52.546 --> 01:53.846
Jess! Jess!

01:53.848 --> 01:54.847
- Do you have
a first aid kit here?

01:54.849 --> 01:55.848
- I don't.

01:55.850 --> 01:59.384
- Yes, okay.
- What the hell is this place?

01:59.386 --> 02:01.186
- It's a battered woman's
shelter.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.421
Secret location.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.224
- Yeah, not so secret.
- Hold on.

02:05.226 --> 02:08.360
- [rasping and whimpering]

02:08.362 --> 02:10.395
- You're gonna be okay.

02:23.209 --> 02:24.710
- What can you tell me
about Jess?

02:24.712 --> 02:26.912
How long has she been here?

02:26.914 --> 02:30.182
- She runs it.
Is she gonna be okay?

02:30.184 --> 02:32.217
- We don't know yet.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.353
- She's strong.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.921
She's the strongest woman
I know.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.190
- That'll help.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.693
- Oh, God, is that Edwin?

02:41.695 --> 02:43.228
- I'm so sorry.

02:43.230 --> 02:46.165
- How could this happen?
[sobs]

02:46.167 --> 02:48.867
- Listen, none of this
is your fault.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.770
Not yours or any of the women
who were seeking safety here,

02:51.772 --> 02:53.672
you understand that?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.741
When I tell you that
we are gonna find the person

02:55.743 --> 02:59.311
who did this and put him away
forever, I mean it.

03:01.514 --> 03:05.384
Did you see who did this?

03:05.386 --> 03:08.387
- Just for, like,
a split second.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.423
White guy, average height.

03:11.425 --> 03:15.961
Um, he was fit,
kinda muscular.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.697
He had his hat pulled down,
so I didn't see his face.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.732
- Okay.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.634
Thank you.
- Come on.

03:22.636 --> 03:26.238
- The shelter's unaffiliated
with any city services.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.240
Got nine women, three children
living here.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.676
- Well, three of those women
fled when the gunmen opened up.

03:30.678 --> 03:34.980
So everyone here needs to be
interviewed and identified.

03:34.982 --> 03:40.252
So, ma'am, can you tell us
the names of the women

03:40.254 --> 03:41.386
who ran away
when this all started?

03:41.388 --> 03:42.654
- I don't know names.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.623
Jess, she said
everything's confidential.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.925
First name's okay, but keep
everything else to yourself.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.460
- Okay.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.362
Can you talk to us
about what happened?

03:50.364 --> 03:51.563
- I was asleep.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.965
I heard gunshots.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.766
Thought I was having
a nightmare, you know?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.935
Then another shot, louder.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.738
I grabbed Darrion
and hid under the bed.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.441
He was scared half to death.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.744
We just closed our eyes
and started praying.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.780
Poor Jess and Edwin.

04:08.782 --> 04:12.251
- All right, let's get you
with family services, come on.

04:12.253 --> 04:15.354
of domestic violence prevention
en route.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.257
They've got placements for all
the women and the families here.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.591
- Good job.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.330
- According
to CPD Special Victims,

04:25.332 --> 04:27.699
Jess Saxon takes on
the most extreme cases,

04:27.701 --> 04:30.702
- Yeah doing a job that must
make a lot of enemies.

04:30.704 --> 04:35.007
No indication of when we're
gonna be able to talk to her,

04:35.009 --> 04:36.808
but Sharon Goodwin
says we will be alerted

04:36.810 --> 04:38.443
as soon as she is in recovery.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.279
Sergeant Platt
already has a protective detail

04:40.281 --> 04:41.413
on her room at the hospital.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.415
- So, the three missing
witnesses.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.018
No logs?
No contact cards at the shelter?

04:46.020 --> 04:48.420
- We recovered a laptop,
but nothing--nothing useful.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.788
- Lady from the shelter said

04:49.790 --> 04:51.456
that Jess wanted everybody
to stay anonymous, so.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.891
- There is a camera
at the rear of the building.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.360
Footage is stored offsite
by a private company.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.528
Judge just signed a warrant,

04:56.530 --> 04:58.030
so we should have it
in about an hour.

04:58.032 --> 05:01.300
- Jess Saxon has an ex with a
laundry list of violent priors.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.635
Jarrod Ganek.
Broke her jaw two years ago.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.870
- Look at this jagoff.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.571
- Yeah, he recently did
30 days in county

05:06.573 --> 05:08.507
for violating
a restraining order against her.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.676
He was released from
Division Six a couple weeks ago.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.377
- Start there.
- I'm gonna go with you.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.579
- No.
You and Al.

05:14.581 --> 05:17.316
Your adrenaline
needs to drop a little.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.385
- That was scary.

05:20.387 --> 05:21.520
- I mean, those poor women.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.621
How're they gonna believe it

05:22.623 --> 05:25.590
- They won't, not after that,
not for a long time.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.926
- You two.
Over here.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.761
- Okay, how can we be
of service, sergeant?

05:29.763 --> 05:31.029
- You see that guy over there?

05:31.031 --> 05:33.665
Robbery victim.
Kent Kosar.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.600
You're gonna love him.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.003
- Home phone.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.505
- Can't you just call me
on my cell?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.374
- Okay.
Leave that one blank.

05:42.376 --> 05:45.811
- Shangri-La motel,
but it is not what you think.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.480
You took a hooker to a motel
and she robbed you?

05:48.482 --> 05:50.749
- What?
No, we matched on Kasuall.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.484
- I don't know what that means.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.653
- It's a dating app.
Short-term dating.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.923
- Keep things casual,
that's what they promise.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.592
Her profile said she was
looking for something NSA.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.961
- No strings attached.
- Yeah, I got that.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.396
- And then what happened?

06:04.398 --> 06:06.531
- You swipe diagonal.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.767
That means, "Let's hook up."
She texts me her address.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.469
I go over there,
lights are out.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.371
A real nice time, right?
Wrong.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.539
Dude comes outta nowhere,
puts a knife to my throat.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.008
Big, huge,
definitely a dude.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.744
- Okay, you got the hair color,
the eye color?

06:18.746 --> 06:21.079
- I already told you
the lights were off.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.415
- Okay, just show me
the profile.

06:23.417 --> 06:26.385
- She--he already erased it.
It's gone.

06:26.387 --> 06:29.454
The name was Spanish.
Carmela, something like that.

06:29.456 --> 06:30.756
Look, I-I don't care about
my wallet.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.091
I just need you to get
my wedding ring back.

06:33.093 --> 06:36.728
- My wife, she had had
back surgery six month ago--

06:36.730 --> 06:37.963
- Yeah, no, no, no, no,
we don't need that part.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.631
- Yeah, we'll look into this,
sir, all right?

06:39.633 --> 06:42.667
Now keep your phone on.
That's all.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.573
- I signed up for it,
like, four months ago.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.409
Out of curiosity.

06:50.411 --> 06:52.477
I never hooked up
or anything.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.112
- Okay.

06:55.014 --> 06:58.550
[vehicle beeps]

06:58.552 --> 07:01.052
- That's him.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.188
Jarrod Ganek.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.956
We need to talk to you about
your ex-wife.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.725
- What'd she say?
- What would she say?

07:06.727 --> 07:10.529
I go to talk to her about money
she owes me after the divorce.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.097
That's it, and I get arrested.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.698
Haven't been within
a million feet of her since.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.501
So if she's saying different,
she can kiss my ass.

07:16.503 --> 07:17.803
- Where were you this morning?

07:17.805 --> 07:20.105
- Why?
- Answer the question.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.440
- I'm not answering a damn thing

07:21.442 --> 07:22.808
until you tell me
what this is about.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.910
- Why don't you take
a step back there, Jarrod?

07:24.912 --> 07:27.546
- I got up at 6:30, after that,
Go Go Donuts, then here.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.947
That's it.
Okay?

07:28.949 --> 07:31.483
So now how 'bout you tell me
what this is about?

07:31.485 --> 07:35.487
- Well, Jess is in the ICU
with a bullet inside her ribs.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.959
- Wait--
w-what?

07:40.961 --> 07:42.961
- We're gonna need
the address of the donut joint

07:42.963 --> 07:45.096
or dig up the receipt.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.566
And you better find somebody
that can verify

07:47.568 --> 07:48.733
when and where you were at.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.869
- Is she gonna be okay?

07:50.871 --> 07:52.971
- What do you care?

08:00.079 --> 08:01.947
- Ganek's alibi held.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.516
Supervisor and a handful
of coworkers confirmed

08:04.518 --> 08:05.951
he was on the clock
during the shooting.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.919
- And we've been digging through
his financials,

08:07.921 --> 08:09.621
just to see if he hired anyone,

08:09.623 --> 08:11.857
and the guy doesn't have
two nickels to rub together.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.792
- You like him for it?

08:13.794 --> 08:16.161
- Once a wife beater,
always a wife beater.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.996
- So Ganek stays on the board,

08:17.998 --> 08:20.065
but we drill down
on the other suspects.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.500
- It's a long list, Sarge.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.834
Lot of men
with a lot of grudges.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.704
- Hey, boss,
we got the security footage.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.710
This is the loading dock
behind the store, right?

08:31.712 --> 08:34.546
- Mm-hmm.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.547
- Ooh.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.715
- All right,
there's more.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.116
This is two minutes later.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.922
- Back it up.

08:47.159 --> 08:48.660
- Who the hell is that?

08:48.662 --> 08:51.029
[phone rings]

08:51.031 --> 08:53.865
- Detective Lindsay.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.034
Yeah, send her up.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.302
One of the women

08:57.304 --> 08:59.604
who fled the shelter
this morning's downstairs.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.776
- I heard gunshots.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.812
And screaming.

09:07.814 --> 09:11.783
So I opened my door
and I looked out.

09:11.785 --> 09:15.687
I saw the back of this man.

09:15.689 --> 09:19.858
He was pointing a gun at Jess.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.060
She had her hands up.
She was--

09:22.062 --> 09:25.130
She was trying to stop him from,
I guess...

09:25.132 --> 09:27.666
shooting one of the women
at the shelter.

09:27.668 --> 09:32.003
I looked over Jess's shoulder
and I saw it was Val.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.607
She was, like...

09:35.609 --> 09:39.177
She was, like, curled up,
crying.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.785
- Can you tell us anything
about the shooter?

09:48.854 --> 09:51.990
- He was tall, white.

09:51.992 --> 09:55.360
He had a ball cap.
It didn't have a logo on it.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.929
I think he had a beard,
but I'm not sure.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.865
- You ever seen him before?

10:03.603 --> 10:06.972
Do you know Val's last name?

10:06.974 --> 10:10.709
No, Jess didn't like us
using last names.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.113
Is Jess gonna be all right?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.848
- She's hanging in there.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.919
- Clarissa, can you--

10:20.921 --> 10:24.255
can you describe Val for us?

10:24.257 --> 10:27.759
- Brown hair.
My height.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.928
Brown eyes.
Thin.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.998
She went to school
in St. John, Indiana.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.101
I think--I think
she played soccer.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.802
- Okay.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.305
- I pulled the virtual yearbooks

10:40.307 --> 10:42.273
for both high schools
in St. John, Indiana.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.742
Now if this girl's about 27,

10:43.744 --> 10:45.910
that means she graduated
about 2007.

10:45.912 --> 10:49.247
- Problem is that there are
no girls named Val or Valerie

10:49.249 --> 10:51.383
on either the JV
or varsity soccer teams.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.852
But I tried the next town over.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.687
One high school.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.788
And...two Valeries.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.356
- Great.
Give me a printout on both.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.991
- You got it.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.760
- Okay.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.194
- That's her.
That's Val.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.663
- Great.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.331
You've been really helpful.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.734
Do you have anywhere to go?

11:09.736 --> 11:12.937
No family in the area
or anything, right?

11:12.939 --> 11:16.341
- Not since I left my husband.
I'm not gonna call him.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.045
- Of course.

11:20.047 --> 11:23.214
Don't worry.
I'll get you taken care of.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.351
Thank you.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.853
- Valerie Holt.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.889
She was our target
at the shelter.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.791
She's got a file
with Special Victims

11:32.793 --> 11:34.859
that names her live-in
boyfriend, Reed Danzig,

11:34.861 --> 11:36.061
as the abuser.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.862
- Danzig beat her
with a blunt object.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.932
Responding officers reported
he was not on scene.

11:40.934 --> 11:44.703
and Valerie got an order
of protection against him.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.037
- All right, Mouse,
what do you got?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.806
- Looks like he's got
a pretty deep sheet.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.307
Possession, aggravated assault,

11:49.309 --> 11:52.343
and domestic battery
to his mother.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.746
- That was
the 34th Tactical Team.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.881
They've been looking for Danzig
for an outstanding warrant

11:56.883 --> 11:59.284
for the domestic battery
and failure to appear.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.953
They, uh, already checked
his addresses.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.388
They can't find him.
- Hey, hold on.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.023
The last three times
Danzig was arrested,

12:05.025 --> 12:07.759
he was bonded out
by a Matthew Markum.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.394
Markum's another valedictorian.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.896
He's got felony possession
of drugs, battery.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.399
- And an address.
Everybody, gear up.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.934
- Yep.

12:31.383 --> 12:33.151
- Got at least one down.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.419
- Get it.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.032
- Clear!
- Sarge.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.400
- Got it.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.145
- We got dope.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.913
- I see it.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.217
- Body.

13:18.030 --> 13:21.933
- Reed Danzig.
Val's boyfriend.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.040
- Guy on the floor,
that's Matthew Markum.

13:29.042 --> 13:33.311
I counted 1/2 dozen shell
casings for a Sig .357,

13:33.313 --> 13:36.281
- Medford, you got an idea
on time of death?

13:36.283 --> 13:38.149
- Body temp
suggests two hours tops.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.219
- Whoever kidnapped Val
came here after the shelter.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.921
- Hey, got a hammer
that we found in the bathtub

13:42.923 --> 13:44.189
that was used
to bludgeon Danzig.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.456
Can you get that
over to the crime lab,

13:45.458 --> 13:50.228
- Looks like they were breaking
down a load of heroin.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.563
- Then why snatch Valerie?

13:51.565 --> 13:53.031
- Trojan Horse.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.200
No sign of forced entry.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.202
Danzig opened the door
for his girlfriend,

13:57.204 --> 13:59.003
shooter pushes past,
rips him off.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.872
- Then she might have outlived
her purpose.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.842
Neighbors say they saw two cars
leaving this place

14:03.844 --> 14:05.176
and one of them was a BMW.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.346
I noticed that he owned
a late model Beemer.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.015
- Huh.
Well, maybe she was in on it?

14:11.017 --> 14:12.283
- All right, tap your CIs.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.286
This is gonna lead us
to Val's kidnapper.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.526
- What's up, Freddie?

14:21.528 --> 14:23.394
- Hey.

14:29.168 --> 14:32.103
- Reed Danzig.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.539
- I heard he came
into some serious weight.

14:38.444 --> 14:39.644
- I already knew that.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.046
- Did you know
he was dumping it cheap?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.615
Which means he probably
stole the load.

14:43.617 --> 14:46.651
In fact, as I see it, that's for
sure what had to happen, right?

14:46.653 --> 14:50.321
I mean, small time charlie
like himself,

14:50.323 --> 14:52.657
ain't no way
he got a couple kilos legit.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.528
Man, are you
kidding me, man?

14:57.530 --> 14:59.631
- There's a girl that's mixed up
in this, Freddie.

14:59.633 --> 15:02.200
She might not live long
if we don't get to her quick.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.102
You feel me?

15:04.104 --> 15:06.905
Now come on.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.207
- Danzig hangs out at this place
near River North

15:09.209 --> 15:11.676
called Club Volume
damn near every night.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.145
That's all I know on the guy.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.513
- Look at me.

15:25.324 --> 15:28.026
You get the rest
if this pans out.

15:28.028 --> 15:31.596
- Yo, are you--are you serious?
You funny, huh?

15:33.198 --> 15:34.933
- Yep, that's Danzig.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.334
- Does Danzig have a beef
with anyone?

15:36.336 --> 15:40.571
I had him blackballed for
knocking his girlfriend around.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.273
- Her?

15:42.275 --> 15:45.710
Val, something like that.
Punching bag type.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.145
- "Punching bag type"?

15:47.147 --> 15:48.713
- Yeah, you know.
- No, I don't know.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.349
- More than once I saw her
catch the back of Danzig's hand.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.318
Led me to believe
she got off on it somehow.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.420
- She got off on it so--
She got off on it?

15:55.422 --> 15:57.155
- Does Danzig come here often?

15:57.157 --> 15:58.289
- A lot.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.458
- Is he mixed up
with any dealers?

16:03.228 --> 16:05.430
- Reed was pretty tight
with this guy,

16:05.432 --> 16:07.732
Billy Shaw, nicknamed Pac Man.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.600
Him I kicked out too.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.536
Trying to sell coke
in the VIP room.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.205
Now, are we done here?

16:16.442 --> 16:18.543
- [scoffs]

16:21.613 --> 16:24.048
- Pulled up everything we had
on Billy "Pac Man" Shaw.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.984
Guy just beat
a manslaughter charge

16:25.986 --> 16:27.251
after running over
a rival dealer

16:27.253 --> 16:28.453
in a Taco Bell parking lot.

16:28.455 --> 16:29.554
Here's the problem.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.356
Silvar from Narcotics
just called.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.591
He hasn't left the house.
He's no good for the murders.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.259
Certainly didn't abduct Valerie.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.328
- Okay, thank you.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.496
That was Chicago Med.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.198
Jess Saxon just got out
of surgery.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.600
- Run code.
Go with.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.236
- Sarge, we think that guy,
Kent Kosar,

16:45.238 --> 16:48.039
was targeted through
a dating app.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.374
- You get this over
to Area Central?

16:49.376 --> 16:53.244
Detectives Lopez and Lillard
said add it to their pile.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.512
- Great, so add it.

16:54.514 --> 16:59.217
Go on the app, put in a profile
similar to Kosar's.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.220
Catfish the catfisher.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.788
- Is that a Dr. Seuss book?

17:03.790 --> 17:06.691
- No...what--
No.

17:06.693 --> 17:10.294
There are two other cases this
month with similar complaints

17:10.296 --> 17:13.531
with MOs using the same dating
app, Kasuall with a "K."

17:13.532 --> 17:15.500
Spanish name,
profile gets erased.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.733
We'll draw them out.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.203
Maybe Sean and I will get lucky.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.805
- That didn't mean
what it sounded like.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.473
- Yeah.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.675
- Okay, run with it.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.152
- So we removed the bullet and
managed to stop the bleeding,

17:34.154 --> 17:35.620
but she's got a long road ahead.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.088
- Thanks, doc.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.356
- If you guys had been
five minutes later,

17:38.358 --> 17:40.258
she would have bled out.

17:43.328 --> 17:47.732
- My mother tried
to talk me out of it.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.535
She called me
Don Quixote.

17:52.304 --> 17:56.074
But I couldn't let what happened
to me happen to others.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.608
I just couldn't.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.611
- It was a brave thing
that you did for those women.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.580
A noble thing.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.648
- [whimpers]

18:03.650 --> 18:06.284
Is Valerie still out there?

18:06.286 --> 18:08.753
- Yeah.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.355
- When she came in,

18:11.357 --> 18:14.358
she was broken,

18:14.360 --> 18:16.627
scared of her own shadow.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.499
The man who did this,

18:21.501 --> 18:24.102
the man who shot me,

18:24.104 --> 18:26.170
he knew her name.

18:26.172 --> 18:29.674
- We think she got away
or he let her go.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.709
- [whimpering]

18:31.711 --> 18:33.845
[sobs]

18:33.847 --> 18:36.414
- Hey.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.483
You are okay.

18:38.485 --> 18:41.786
- [crying]

18:41.788 --> 18:44.555
- You did nothing wrong.

18:44.557 --> 18:49.594
- Do you have any idea
where Valerie might be?

18:49.596 --> 18:51.762
Anything that could help us?

18:51.764 --> 18:54.665
- Did you find my safe?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.767
- At the shelter?

18:56.769 --> 19:01.606
- When the women arrive, they
give me what they came in with.

19:01.608 --> 19:05.409
Anything that can remind them of
what they're hiding from,

19:05.411 --> 19:09.147
or...what they're fighting for.

19:14.386 --> 19:18.222
- They name parks and streets
after politicians in this city.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.524
Women like that
are the real heroes

19:19.526 --> 19:21.192
and nobody ever knows
their names.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.460
- You all right?

19:22.462 --> 19:23.694
- Yeah.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.429
- All right,
I'll call Voight.

19:33.272 --> 19:34.705
- Got it.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.444
- What's this?

19:40.446 --> 19:42.914
- Valerie has a son?
- How'd we miss that?

19:42.916 --> 19:44.382
- Things are moving fast.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.250
Different last name?

19:46.252 --> 19:48.719
- Or he's deceased.
Here's a prayer card.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.788
In loving memory of...

19:52.391 --> 19:54.659
- Mouse, is there a cemetery
in West Chesterfield

19:54.661 --> 19:56.427
where Danzig's car was dumped?

20:05.637 --> 20:08.739
- [crying quietly]

20:19.218 --> 20:20.585
- Valerie Holt?

20:23.522 --> 20:25.623
- [sniffs]

20:27.526 --> 20:29.594
It's all my fault.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.934
- After he--

20:36.936 --> 20:40.705
After he killed
Reed and Matthew,

20:40.707 --> 20:42.373
he got a phone call.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.842
I grabbed the keys
and I just ran out the back.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.744
- Who is he?

20:46.746 --> 20:49.547
- I don't know, I swear.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.515
- The police officers
that picked you up

20:51.517 --> 20:54.385
said you told them
that this was your fault.

20:54.387 --> 20:55.853
- I...

20:55.855 --> 20:57.355
He made me knock on the door

20:57.357 --> 21:03.261
And when Reed answered the door,
I tried to scream, but--

21:03.263 --> 21:04.829
I'm sorry.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.764
I'm sorry, I don't--
I don't--

21:06.766 --> 21:10.368
I don't know how I got here.
I'm not this person.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.837
I've just been on a slide.

21:12.839 --> 21:16.340
- Ever since you lost your son?

21:16.342 --> 21:18.409
- Yes.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.849
I guess I just gave up.

21:26.485 --> 21:30.288
I stopped caring about what
happened to me and sometimes...

21:30.290 --> 21:31.856
sometimes I think these things
I've gone through,

21:31.858 --> 21:34.058
I think it's--
think it's punishment,

21:34.060 --> 21:38.062
- I know what you mean.
- No, you don't, you haven't...

21:38.064 --> 21:42.066
just like the one you were in
for three months.

21:43.335 --> 21:45.036
I was 11.

21:45.038 --> 21:47.371
And my mom was...

21:49.074 --> 21:53.544
She was never very good
at taking care of herself.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.613
Always on something,
always with a guy who hit her,

21:55.615 --> 21:56.781
and I thought it was my fault.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.450
I thought I didn't
support her enough.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.721
- But you came through it.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.994
- Let us help you, Val.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.831
Okay?

22:16.902 --> 22:19.370
Talk to me about
how this all got started.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.408
- Reed and I were hanging out
at this club.

22:24.410 --> 22:27.078
He told me he was gonna steal
the owner's stash of dope

22:27.080 --> 22:28.646
and I said
that was crazy stupid,

22:28.648 --> 22:31.415
but he wouldn't listen to me.

22:31.417 --> 22:35.753
I told him that I was gonna
tell them what he was gonna do,

22:35.755 --> 22:37.955
thinking that maybe
he would stop this insane plan,

22:37.957 --> 22:40.458
but he got so mad, he hit me.

22:42.394 --> 22:44.895
He k-kept hitting me.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.668
I went to the shelter
after that.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.137
- And Reed stole the drugs.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.539
- The guy who got me
at the shelter,

22:55.541 --> 22:57.041
I don't know his name,

22:57.043 --> 22:59.543
but I've seen him at the club.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.878
- What club?

23:00.880 --> 23:03.147
- Volume on La Salle.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.648
I've seen him talking
to the owner,

23:04.650 --> 23:08.085
this guy named Martin Ainge.

23:08.087 --> 23:11.522
- So Martin gets ripped off

23:11.524 --> 23:13.924
and he sends this guy
to grab you this morning.

23:13.926 --> 23:16.494
- He didn't know
where Reed lived.

23:18.163 --> 23:20.564
But he knew where to find me.

23:26.505 --> 23:30.007
- Martin Ainge, club owner
at Volume in River North

23:30.009 --> 23:31.709
and apparent drug trafficker.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.177
Didn't take kindly
to being ripped off,

23:33.179 --> 23:34.945
so he unleashed the wrath of God
to get even.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.180
- That name Ainge gave us

23:36.182 --> 23:38.048
when we first interviewed him,
Pac Man,

23:38.050 --> 23:40.918
just a wank to get us
to chase our tail.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.952
- Clearly.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.754
- Get Ainge in here.

23:52.497 --> 23:53.964
- Oh, God, I mean,

23:53.966 --> 23:56.967
this is depressing
and desperate and lonely.

23:56.969 --> 23:58.702
- Check this out.
- Yeah?

23:58.704 --> 24:00.037
- I know that face.
- How?

24:00.039 --> 24:01.806
- I read "Sports Illustrated,"
that's how.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.908
She's a swimsuit model
from Brazil.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.643
Her name's Esperanza Ricupero,

24:05.645 --> 24:10.014

in Chicago under a false name.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.582
Check this out.
- What?

24:11.584 --> 24:12.950
- NSA.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.119

- Yeah, no, I got it.

24:16.988 --> 24:18.556
Now what?

24:18.558 --> 24:20.024
- Now we wait.

24:22.928 --> 24:26.497

24:26.499 --> 24:28.232

24:28.234 --> 24:30.167

24:35.107 --> 24:36.740

of his comedies.

24:36.742 --> 24:38.876
It's put together and, like,
you're in a--sort of--

24:38.878 --> 24:41.545

24:41.547 --> 24:43.047

when I bought the tickets.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.682
- This is getting sadder
by the minute, Burgess.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.050
- Is it any sadder
than you being on this site

24:46.052 --> 24:49.053

you never followed through.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.755

24:53.693 --> 24:55.626
You and Ruzek,
there's an argument to be made

24:55.628 --> 24:57.828
for keeping things casual
with a "K."

24:57.830 --> 24:59.563
And for your information,
Burgess,

24:59.565 --> 25:03.167
I have never hooked up on this.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.269
Wait, they hit me back.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.037

25:07.039 --> 25:08.672
[engine turning over]

25:08.674 --> 25:11.041
- You seem like
a reasonable man, Mr. Ainge.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.276
- Well, I like to think so.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.712
Which is why I'm here
without my attorney.

25:14.714 --> 25:17.615
That and I don't have
to pay the $500 retainer fee.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.183
How 'bout you guys?
You guys reasonable?

25:19.185 --> 25:20.551
- Absolutely.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.152

25:22.154 --> 25:24.021
"Let there be commerce
between us."

25:24.023 --> 25:25.623
- Okay, we've been dealing

25:25.625 --> 25:27.758
with a couple different
parts of an investigation.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.693

25:29.695 --> 25:31.095
Where they all lead to
is your club,

25:31.097 --> 25:32.696

25:32.698 --> 25:34.565

25:34.567 --> 25:36.567

Mr. Ainge?

25:36.569 --> 25:39.236
- We've got a pretty reliable
source says that he did.

25:39.238 --> 25:42.039
- Guys, I am legit.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.041
I'm good friends
with the commander

25:44.043 --> 25:46.310

Eric O'Quinn.

25:46.312 --> 25:49.647
Give him a call.
He will definitely vouch for me.

25:49.649 --> 25:53.651
I sponsor two holes
at his annual golf benefit.

25:53.653 --> 25:56.820
He runs his promotion parties
out of my club.

25:58.123 --> 26:01.191

- Atlantic City, why?

26:01.193 --> 26:03.193

26:03.195 --> 26:06.664

26:06.666 --> 26:07.865

26:07.867 --> 26:09.667
They're all dead.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.770
Markum, Danzig, they're from
your side of the street,

26:12.772 --> 26:17.041
so I don't really care about
that, but this man...

26:17.043 --> 26:20.578
That's Edwin Sanders.

26:20.580 --> 26:24.114
He died protecting innocent
women and children at a shelter.

26:24.116 --> 26:27.351
Six people are gonna be
carrying his casket.

26:27.353 --> 26:30.321
Four of 'em will be
his own children.

26:30.323 --> 26:33.991
There's a woman
fighting for her life

26:33.993 --> 26:36.226

It leads to you.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.343
I have no doubt in my mind.

26:53.979 --> 26:57.915
So you want to keep
doing business in this town,

26:57.917 --> 27:02.319
give us the name that is on the
tip of your tongue right now.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.655
- I think you've been dealing
with too many

27:04.657 --> 27:07.091
of those women
at that shelter, Detective.

27:14.232 --> 27:16.000
- Okay.

27:22.674 --> 27:24.908
Why don't you explain that
to me?

27:24.910 --> 27:27.211
- They like
to get pushed around.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.780
I don't.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.182
- I don't think you really know

27:32.184 --> 27:35.886
what getting pushed around is,
Martin.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.988
- Call my attorney.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.757
Unless I'm being arrested.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.932

Crime techs were able to get
a fingerprint off the handle

28:00.946 --> 28:02.780

to cave in Danzig's head.

your ex-boyfriend to death?

28:24.169 --> 28:26.470
- You are gonna get straight
with me, Valerie, right now.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.405
- I didn't do it.

28:28.407 --> 28:31.942
I couldn't.
- Your prints are on the hammer.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.144
- He handed it to me.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.946
He had Reed on his knees
in the bathroom

28:35.948 --> 28:39.283
and he handed me the hammer
and he said to do it.

28:39.285 --> 28:43.187
He said to hit him,
but I didn't.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.222
He put a gun to my head

28:45.224 --> 28:48.125
and said he would kill me too,
but I still couldn't do it.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.293
- Valerie--

28:49.295 --> 28:51.395
- I wanted to.

28:51.397 --> 28:55.132
After everything Reed's
ever done to me, I wanted to.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.200
But I didn't.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.001
I didn't do it.

28:58.003 --> 29:00.938
I didn't even raise my hand.
I couldn't.

29:02.941 --> 29:05.375
He laughed.

29:05.377 --> 29:09.313
He snatched the hammer back
from me, and he just started...

29:09.315 --> 29:11.782
whacking the back
of Reed's head.

29:16.154 --> 29:18.889
He was wearing gloves.

29:18.891 --> 29:21.825
He took the hammer from me.
That's the truth.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.195
And then he made me
get on my knees.

29:25.197 --> 29:28.332
And I thought for sure
he was gonna kill me too.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.933
But he got a phone call.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.436
Ainge, probably.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.538
I had seen Reed's keys
by the front door.

29:34.540 --> 29:37.808
My heart started
beating out of my chest,

29:37.810 --> 29:39.276
and I knew I had, like,
a second to make a move,

29:39.278 --> 29:42.813
and I just--I just grabbed
the keys and I ran.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.785
- Okay.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.419
But you didn't go
to the police.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.889
Why?

29:51.891 --> 29:55.325
- I knew they were gonna
find me eventually anyway.

29:57.896 --> 30:00.564
So I drove to Brady's gravesite.

30:02.867 --> 30:06.303
If I was gonna die,
I wanted to die with him.

to prosecute.

35:51.183 --> 35:55.752
So, you know,
some patsy takes the fall.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.622
Worse, he ends up dead,
that sort of thing.

36:00.791 --> 36:05.495
Me and my unit end up muzzled,
even though we know who did it.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.531
Hmm?

36:14.272 --> 36:16.573
I was thinking about something.

36:19.710 --> 36:22.679
See, a long time ago,
they told me,

36:22.681 --> 36:27.217
those little statues of Justice
are blindfolded so she can...

36:27.219 --> 36:29.853
What is it?

36:29.855 --> 36:32.222
So she can remain impartial.

36:34.559 --> 36:35.959
You know what I'm thinking?

36:35.961 --> 36:41.531
I'm thinking I'm glad
she's blindfolded, 'cause...

36:41.533 --> 36:43.900
there are times...

36:43.902 --> 36:46.636
I gotta do things
she wouldn't want to see.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.875
- You want to work something
out, we can work something out.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.511
- Listen.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.281
Go back to Atlantic City, Ainge.

37:00.551 --> 37:04.454
You got 24 hours, and trust me,

37:04.456 --> 37:06.489
I'll come looking for you.

37:08.826 --> 37:11.661
I mean, you're not out
of my city by then...

37:14.265 --> 37:16.566
you and me are gonna
take a ride.

37:18.903 --> 37:22.339
I'll show you parts of Chicago
you never seen before.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.842
You understand what I'm saying?

37:28.946 --> 37:32.949
- Yeah, yeah, o-o-okay.
All right, yeah, I get it.

37:34.785 --> 37:36.453
- Good.

37:49.033 --> 37:50.767
- You ready?

37:53.604 --> 37:55.839
- She really asked to see me?

37:57.875 --> 37:59.643
'Cause I don't think
I can go in there.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.645
- She did,
and you can.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.513
- But--
[inhales]

38:03.515 --> 38:05.415
- Listen, you want to leave,
the door's right there

38:05.417 --> 38:06.983
and I can make up an excuse.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.452
But this is a chance
for you to start

38:09.454 --> 38:11.988
taking control
of your own life.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.891
Right here, right now.

38:21.932 --> 38:24.868
Okay.
Come on.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.744
- Jess.

38:38.015 --> 38:40.016
[sobs]
I'm so sorry.

38:43.921 --> 38:46.423
- I'm just glad you're okay.

39:11.115 --> 39:12.415
- Hey.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.486
I knew you wouldn't
eat those tickets.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.588
- What are you doing here?

39:18.590 --> 39:21.458
- I was taught to never let your
partner go through a door alone.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.596
Shall we?

39:26.598 --> 39:27.831
- Yeah.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.099
[laughs]
Okay.

39:33.704 --> 39:37.006
- You know what a millimeter is?

39:37.008 --> 39:38.508
That's how close
that bullet came

39:38.510 --> 39:40.810
to nicking your victim's
aortic artery.

39:42.146 --> 39:44.547
- When it's not your time...

39:44.549 --> 39:46.149
- Hey, another round, guys?

39:46.151 --> 39:48.385
Extended happy hour
for family and friends.

39:48.387 --> 39:51.154
Just don't tell Herrmann.
- I gotta run actually.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.956
Conference at
U Chicago tomorrow.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.091
- Well, leave it.
I'll take it.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.826
Leave the bottle.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.061
- Put it on my tab, Otis.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.662
- You got it.

40:05.569 --> 40:08.171
- You never told me you stayed
in a shelter.

40:11.776 --> 40:14.444
- Um...

40:17.681 --> 40:21.050
- We don't have
to talk about it, but...

40:21.052 --> 40:23.153
- No, no, it's not a thing.

40:23.155 --> 40:25.688
It's not, like,
a bad memory.

40:25.690 --> 40:28.525
Um...

40:28.527 --> 40:31.161
It was summer.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.829
Air conditioner rattled a lot.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.898
It was, like,
right next to my bed.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.136
Bunny forgot my first day
of school.

40:40.138 --> 40:43.072
So the lady that ran the place,

40:43.074 --> 40:45.575
she walked me all the way there.

40:45.577 --> 40:47.744
She held my hand the whole way.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.147
Actually drove by there
a couple weeks ago,

40:51.149 --> 40:53.550
and I saw her and she was...

40:53.552 --> 40:56.553
walking another little girl
to school.

40:56.555 --> 40:58.087
- She recognize you?

40:59.723 --> 41:01.891
- I don't know.
I didn't stop.
