"Workin' Moms".

00:07.255 --> 00:08.588
Richard: You got the job.

00:08.588 --> 00:11.172
Can you leave in a week?
- A week?

00:11.172 --> 00:12.547
- Anne?

00:12.547 --> 00:14.130
- I landed on my stomach.

00:14.130 --> 00:16.088
Val: Are you prepared for the
hormonal shift that can occur

00:16.088 --> 00:17.422
when you quit breast feeding?

00:17.422 --> 00:19.588
- I already had postpartum,
can't get it twice.

00:19.588 --> 00:22.088
- The baby is fine.
- What?!

00:22.088 --> 00:24.172
- You don't seem happy.

00:24.172 --> 00:27.505
- Because of me, we can
potentially get out of debt.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.172
- I guess you don't even
need me, Kate.

00:32.172 --> 00:34.047
(Axe thuds)

00:34.047 --> 00:36.088
- (Huffs) I really thought
I'd be better at this,

00:36.088 --> 00:37.880
otherwise I never would
have suggested it.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.172
- That's a revealing statement.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.838
Try using your ass next time.
Clench it.

00:40.838 --> 00:42.755
- You've done this before?
- Yeah, of course I have.

00:42.755 --> 00:46.297
- So I guess no one else
is coming?

00:46.297 --> 00:48.047
- Yeah, it seems our fellow
"Mommy and Me'rs"

00:48.047 --> 00:49.922
disapprove of my field trip
choice.

00:49.922 --> 00:51.797

are weak.

00:51.797 --> 00:53.713
Frankie, drive it home!

00:55.172 --> 00:57.130

Yes!

- Does Lionel know you're here,
in your, uh, condition?

01:00.255 --> 01:03.630
- Hey, I'm not even throwing.
What, should I just be dead?

01:03.630 --> 01:05.630
Is that one of the approved
list on activities?

- Woo!

01:10.713 --> 01:11.963

01:11.963 --> 01:13.338
- I always thought
you could run

01:13.338 --> 01:15.422

country, Anne.

01:15.422 --> 01:18.422

Britney: No. So, Kate,
what is it that you do?

09:53.713 --> 09:55.630
- Yeah, Sarah
hasn't said much about you.

09:55.630 --> 09:57.422
It's so sweet,
she's helping you out.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.630
- Family is so important.
- Aren't they?

09:59.630 --> 10:02.880
Yeah, it's numero uno for me.
The most important.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.047
All: (Unimpressed) Hm.

10:05.047 --> 10:08.255
- Oh, Yeah.
- Which is why I've, uh...

10:08.255 --> 10:11.172
decided to spend most of my
days at home with him.

10:11.172 --> 10:14.380
- So, then, um...
why do you need help?

10:14.380 --> 10:17.005
- I need help because well...

10:18.338 --> 10:20.088
You know what?
I think I got this.

10:20.088 --> 10:22.213
Little play date. If you wanna
go take some "you" time.

10:22.213 --> 10:23.630
- Okay, Cool.

10:23.630 --> 10:26.088
Bye girls.
Girls: Bye.

10:28.547 --> 10:29.963
- She's obsessed with him.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.005
You know, and she, she's decided
not to have children.

10:33.005 --> 10:34.755
Girls: Oh.
- So sad.

10:36.422 --> 10:39.588
- It is so sad.
So sad and so true.

10:40.713 --> 10:42.547
(Baby coos)

10:43.588 --> 10:44.963
(Grunts in discomfort)

10:44.963 --> 10:48.297
- Can I help you with that?
Anne: I got it.

10:48.297 --> 10:52.213
Hey Alice,
where should we go now, huh?

10:52.213 --> 10:54.505
Where have you always
dreamt of going?

10:54.505 --> 10:56.047
- Disney World.

10:56.047 --> 10:57.963
- How 'bout within driving
distance?

10:57.963 --> 10:59.672
- Wal-Mart!

10:59.672 --> 11:01.963
- Okay. (Sneezes)

11:01.963 --> 11:03.797
- Gesundheit.

11:06.338 --> 11:08.880
(Car keys clatter
on the ground)

11:08.880 --> 11:10.963
- Mommy! You're bleeding!

11:12.130 --> 11:14.047
- Shit.
- Oh no.

11:14.047 --> 11:15.630
Okay, Alice get in the car!

11:15.630 --> 11:17.338
Okay, we've gotta get you
to the Hospital right now.

11:17.338 --> 11:18.588
C'mon, let's go.

11:18.588 --> 11:20.922
(Doors slam)

11:20.922 --> 11:23.672
You in?

11:23.672 --> 11:25.005
(Engine whirs,
seatbelts click)

11:25.005 --> 11:27.047
(Anne inhales and exhales)

11:27.047 --> 11:29.047
- You're not funny.
- Thank you.

11:29.047 --> 11:30.380
(Laughing)

11:31.463 --> 11:33.713
(Hard whack)
- Ow! Charlie, no.

11:33.713 --> 11:35.297
No hitting.

11:36.505 --> 11:37.755
What's wrong?

11:37.755 --> 11:39.963
- It's just that this
is a "no" free circle.

11:39.963 --> 11:41.797
- Yeah.
- It's important.

11:41.797 --> 11:44.547
- So you guys never say no?

11:44.547 --> 11:46.130
Girls: No.

11:47.755 --> 11:49.463
- So, can I borrow a hundred
thousand dollars?

11:49.463 --> 11:51.172
(Laughs) Can't say no.

11:51.172 --> 11:54.672
- Oh, do you need money?
- No. Of course not.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.588
- 'Cause I could talk
to my husband.

11:57.588 --> 11:59.255
- Yeah?

11:59.255 --> 12:01.630
- (Chuckles) I'm kidding.
I'm kidding, geez.

12:01.630 --> 12:03.422
(Laughing)

12:04.755 --> 12:05.922
Come on.

12:05.922 --> 12:07.755
- No, totally.
I'm more joking than you.

12:07.755 --> 12:11.838
I'm totally financially stable.
Britney: Yeah.

12:11.838 --> 12:13.547
- Well, this,
this has been great.

12:13.547 --> 12:15.463
This has been a really fun
play-date.

12:15.463 --> 12:17.505
Um, we're gonna hit it though

12:17.505 --> 12:20.088
because we gotta a lot
of errands to run.

12:20.088 --> 12:21.213
But you guys,

12:21.213 --> 12:24.505
Sarah should get all your
numbers

12:24.505 --> 12:27.213
and we'll do this again.

12:27.213 --> 12:29.963
- Once again, the baby is fine.
- Okay, thank goodness.

12:29.963 --> 12:32.672
- You, on the other hand,
I warned you.

12:32.672 --> 12:34.922
As you're aware, at the
slightest sight of blood,

12:34.922 --> 12:36.297
we have to be more cautious,

12:36.297 --> 12:38.005
so you are officially
on bed rest.

12:38.005 --> 12:40.130
- God dammit!
- Anne.

12:40.130 --> 12:42.172
- Something tells me you
weren't taking it as easy

12:42.172 --> 12:43.713
as I advised.

12:43.713 --> 12:45.672
- Yeah, uh, how could you go
pony riding in your condition.

12:45.672 --> 12:47.130
I mean, you promised me!

12:47.130 --> 12:48.838
- Those ponies had their
spirits crushed along time ago.

12:48.838 --> 12:50.547
We barely moved.
- In any case,

12:50.547 --> 12:52.797
it's your lucky day.
I've decided to allow you

12:52.797 --> 12:55.005
to have your bed rest at home,
for now.

12:55.005 --> 12:57.463
Any changes and it'll
be hospitalization.

12:57.463 --> 12:58.880
- Lucky day, indeed.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.755
- That means you're only
permitted to get out of bed

13:00.755 --> 13:02.963
when absolutely necessary.
- Spectacular.

13:02.963 --> 13:06.755
- And lastly, you're on pelvic
rest until further notice.

13:06.755 --> 13:09.797
- Uh, wait, how's she supposed
to go number two?

13:09.797 --> 13:11.713
- Through her anus.

13:11.713 --> 13:13.963
Pelvic rest means
no sexual intercourse.

13:13.963 --> 13:16.047
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay,
that won't be a problem.

13:16.047 --> 13:18.797
- Good.
- Are we done, can we go?

13:18.797 --> 13:20.463
- Sure.

13:20.463 --> 13:22.880
- Anne.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.588
Your bed rest starts now,
in case that wasn't clear.

13:28.797 --> 13:31.213
They're comfier than they look.
Lionel: Hmm?

13:33.838 --> 13:36.088
- Oh my dear, Frankie.

13:36.088 --> 13:38.422
We got some great times
over the years, haven't we?

13:38.422 --> 13:40.797
- Ah, the house formally owned
by the artist

13:40.797 --> 13:43.713
formally known as Bryan Adams.

13:43.713 --> 13:47.005
- Uh, and you invested
that nest egg well, right?

13:47.005 --> 13:49.463
- Yeah, of course, Giselle
made me put it in the bank.

13:49.463 --> 13:50.838
- Good. So...

13:50.838 --> 13:53.922
I'm sensing something
has been a bit...

13:55.255 --> 13:58.213
off with you lately.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.963
Frankie there have been
a few complaints.

14:01.963 --> 14:05.047
- Complaints? Uh, right. Okay.

14:05.047 --> 14:06.755
- Now I don't know
what happened today,

14:06.755 --> 14:10.797
but I heard from Adam Frasier--
- Yeah.

14:10.797 --> 14:14.463
Yeah, I ran into
Adam Frasier today.

14:14.463 --> 14:18.713
- Frankie, I am in
a tricky position.

14:18.713 --> 14:22.047
I mean, what do you think
I should do here.

14:22.047 --> 14:23.255
- Um...

14:24.630 --> 14:28.297
you think I should...
take some time off?

14:31.255 --> 14:33.922
- That's a very logical
decision.

16:25.922 --> 16:28.380
I will get some fresh paint

friends.

Best friends.

a break from work.
