00:01.555 --> 00:03.163
***

00:03.164 --> 00:06.126
******

00:06.127 --> 00:07.873
You seem to forget I'm your boss.

00:10.057 --> 00:12.003
This is my son Sam.

00:12.004 --> 00:13.514
Sam hasn't lived with me

00:13.515 --> 00:15.045
since he was 11.

00:15.046 --> 00:19.378
His dad dropped him off
at my doorstep yesterday.

00:19.379 --> 00:21.067
Figuring out why you both chose

00:21.068 --> 00:22.820
to do what you did

00:22.821 --> 00:25.530
will allow the relationship
to move forward.

00:25.531 --> 00:27.615
Why did you agree to marry Ryan?

00:28.315 --> 00:29.423
I don't know. Um...

00:29.424 --> 00:31.548
Would you both consider
a little time apart?

00:31.549 --> 00:34.075
It might give Cate the
emotional space she needs.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.370
Ryan.

00:35.371 --> 00:37.064
You still owe me one.

00:37.065 --> 00:39.203
I see you've met Mr. Daniels.

00:39.628 --> 00:40.254
You're a...

00:40.255 --> 00:41.333
Teacher.

00:41.712 --> 00:44.662
Lux, have you ever been tested
for a learning disability?

00:44.663 --> 00:45.604
What?

00:45.605 --> 00:47.875
Because I think that you might have one.

00:47.876 --> 00:48.869
If Cate and Baze find out

00:48.870 --> 00:50.851
that Eric and I were
in a hotel last night.

00:50.852 --> 00:52.837
Tash, he could lose his job.

00:55.839 --> 00:57.632
Okay. You guys, we're serious.

00:57.633 --> 01:00.925
Wait. I actually stayed at that hotel.

01:00.926 --> 01:01.715
You messed up

01:01.716 --> 01:03.867
big time. I really hope
that it was worth it.

01:03.868 --> 01:05.758
Yeah, me, too.

01:15.245 --> 01:16.684
Good morning, Portland.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.181
Now, for those of you just joining us,

01:18.182 --> 01:20.901
we are trying to get to the
bottom of Kelly's issues.

01:20.902 --> 01:22.906
I don't have any issues, Ryan.

01:22.907 --> 01:24.119
You have issues.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.006
Come on, Kelly. You know
what I'm talking about.

01:26.007 --> 01:27.185
You were on your book tour.

01:27.186 --> 01:28.347
For my current bestseller,

01:28.348 --> 01:29.427
you can't have it all.

01:29.428 --> 01:30.615
In a different city,

01:30.616 --> 01:32.228
in a different hotel every weekend

01:32.229 --> 01:33.580
for the last two months.

01:33.581 --> 01:36.893
And yet you still manage to not get laid.

01:36.894 --> 01:38.712
Stop talking about my sex life.

01:38.713 --> 01:40.162
Yeah, well, stop talking
about my marriage.

01:40.163 --> 01:41.453
What marriage?

01:43.944 --> 01:45.995
All right. We'll be right
back with more morning madness

01:45.996 --> 01:47.415
after this.

01:50.889 --> 01:52.619
Is Ryan getting moodier?

01:53.098 --> 01:54.419
It's like he's turning into you.

01:58.524 --> 01:59.563
Okay. So.

02:00.855 --> 02:03.571
You and Kelly. You really
seem to be getting along.

02:03.769 --> 02:05.105
Yeah. About as well as you and I.

02:05.106 --> 02:07.359
Yeah, yeah. How's Baze's?

02:08.130 --> 02:11.243
Aside from the fact that the
place smells like burnt beer...

02:13.043 --> 02:14.057
It's fine.

02:14.947 --> 02:16.876
You know you didn't
have to move in with him.

02:16.877 --> 02:18.352
He owed me one.

02:18.791 --> 02:20.489
In fact, he owed me 100.

02:20.643 --> 02:22.806
And you wanted space,
so... yeah, well, you said

02:22.807 --> 02:24.427
you married me because your ex-girlfriend

02:24.428 --> 02:25.630
didn't want to marry you.

02:25.631 --> 02:27.156
Okay, Cate, you're
oversimplifying what I said.

02:27.157 --> 02:28.964
I hate when you do that.

02:29.606 --> 02:32.599
Look, at least I tried
to give an honest answer.

02:34.525 --> 02:36.540
Any chance you figured
out why you married me?

02:40.807 --> 02:41.469
Yeah.

02:43.031 --> 02:44.502
Better keep working on that.

02:50.043 --> 02:52.953
Tomorrow night is homecoming.
Better "bee" there.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.567
I see you found a legal
way to graffiti the place.

03:06.237 --> 03:07.845
T, I'm-I'm sorry.

03:08.667 --> 03:11.857
Sorry enough to fess up to
Cate about you and Minnesota?

03:12.888 --> 03:15.320
Look, I appreciate what you did

03:15.526 --> 03:16.823
covering for us.

03:16.824 --> 03:18.054
I don't.

03:18.055 --> 03:20.712
Because of your island vacation with Eric,

03:20.713 --> 03:22.988
I don't get to go to
homecoming with Jones.

03:22.989 --> 03:24.044
Wait. What?

03:24.045 --> 03:27.961
He asked me but Cate won't
let me go 'cause I'm grounded.

03:27.962 --> 03:29.231
All right, let me talk to her.

03:29.232 --> 03:31.583
Maybe... maybe I can promise
her that if I go with you

03:31.584 --> 03:33.051
then you won't get into trouble.

03:33.052 --> 03:36.402
As if you're the poster
child for responsibility.

03:36.403 --> 03:38.138
I will convince her.

03:38.139 --> 03:39.570
Come on.

03:39.924 --> 03:41.717
Okay, I want to make it up to you.

03:43.237 --> 03:44.949
It's not like I have a date.

03:45.468 --> 03:47.550
Yeah, the downside of dating.

03:47.551 --> 03:48.153
Lux.

03:50.402 --> 03:51.945
Your parents are here.

03:54.924 --> 03:56.018
Teacher.

03:57.823 --> 03:59.019
As you know, Ms. Jennings and I

03:59.020 --> 03:59.927
have been trying to figure out

03:59.928 --> 04:01.750
what's holding Lux back in school.

04:01.751 --> 04:03.959
There's a condition called dysgraphia.

04:03.960 --> 04:07.452
It's an inability to
express thoughts in writing.

04:07.453 --> 04:09.612
Oh. Well, I have that.

04:09.613 --> 04:11.063
You know the term "buck naked"?

04:11.064 --> 04:13.213
I always write down "butt naked."

04:13.638 --> 04:16.248
Which isn't really wrong,
because butts are naked.

04:16.249 --> 04:19.500
Well, you can see how she
struggles to complete sentences.

04:20.196 --> 04:21.894
Thoughts get jumbled.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.799
Words are illegible.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.012
At a glance it just looks
like poor penmanship,

04:26.013 --> 04:27.089
but it's actually

04:27.090 --> 04:28.902
a neurological disability.

04:28.903 --> 04:31.133
Oh, so, what, she was born with this?

04:31.134 --> 04:32.668
Did one of us give it to her?

04:32.669 --> 04:35.216
Well, in looking at Lux's file,

04:35.217 --> 04:38.004
Mr. Daniels noticed that
her handwriting was perfect

04:38.005 --> 04:39.238
till seventh grade.

04:39.239 --> 04:41.643
Well, I mean, the question is,

04:41.644 --> 04:43.068
what changed?

04:43.069 --> 04:45.213
You mean something caused this?

04:45.214 --> 04:46.958
Well, we can't exactly answer that.

04:46.959 --> 04:48.991
Maybe a neuro-physiologist could.

04:48.992 --> 04:49.923
The school has someone

04:49.924 --> 04:52.752
that they highly
recommend. And I called him,

04:52.753 --> 04:55.217
and he could give her an mri tomorrow.

04:56.222 --> 04:59.112
You can't say the teachers
at Westmonte don't care.

04:59.391 --> 05:00.685
If possible, Lux should also start

05:00.686 --> 05:02.902
working with a dysgraphia specialist.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.804
It's an added expense, but...

05:04.805 --> 05:05.254
Yeah.

05:06.787 --> 05:09.144
Whatever it takes. Money's no problem.

05:09.145 --> 05:09.727
Okay.

05:10.138 --> 05:12.285
Well, I have a list of
contacts in the main office.

05:12.286 --> 05:13.570
Why don't you come with me.

05:14.173 --> 05:15.312
Stay here, okay?

05:19.518 --> 05:20.397
Thank you.

05:31.295 --> 05:33.569
Gosh, this is so...

05:33.570 --> 05:34.875
Typical.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.620
While every other teenager in the world

05:36.621 --> 05:38.545
is getting ready for homecoming,

05:38.546 --> 05:41.095
I will be getting my head examined.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.356
I spent most of my life in hospitals.

05:43.357 --> 05:45.442
I... I hate them.

05:47.101 --> 05:48.757
I'll make a deal with you.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.326
You go get that mri tomorrow,

05:51.327 --> 05:53.266
and tomorrow night, I'll make you

05:53.267 --> 05:54.524
a homecoming of our own.

05:54.525 --> 05:56.365
Complete with spiked punch, bad music,

05:56.366 --> 05:57.751
the whole nine.

06:01.031 --> 06:02.665
You'd really do that for me?

06:03.153 --> 06:05.166
Don't you get it by now, Lux?

06:05.925 --> 06:07.517
For you, I'd do anything.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.113
Hey. So I was...

06:19.114 --> 06:20.237
Oh!

06:21.170 --> 06:23.192
I was looking for your mom.

06:23.370 --> 06:24.401
Sam, right?

06:25.058 --> 06:26.701
The guy who was yelling about bus sex

06:26.702 --> 06:28.447
outside of her condo, right?

06:30.476 --> 06:32.758
So does your, does your mom know

06:32.759 --> 06:34.452
that you're here? Are you kidding me?

06:34.453 --> 06:36.182
She's the reason I'm here.

06:36.183 --> 06:39.069
She's afraid if I stay home,
I'll burn the place down.

06:39.218 --> 06:40.967
Hmm, that a valid concern.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.509
Just happened to me, actually.

06:42.510 --> 06:45.231
There was this bartender.
Her body was nuts.

06:45.232 --> 06:45.937
Hey.

06:46.497 --> 06:48.618
The cashews... I love cashews.

06:49.010 --> 06:50.010
How's it going?

06:50.011 --> 06:51.079
Here.

06:51.961 --> 06:53.460
I warmed your seat for you.

06:54.436 --> 06:55.342
Where are you going?

06:55.343 --> 06:56.500
To get a soda, okay?

06:56.501 --> 06:59.388
Relax. I'm not going to
rob the vending machine.

06:59.944 --> 07:00.703
Hmm.

07:03.470 --> 07:04.805
Did you see these?

07:04.806 --> 07:07.855
The firm bought two tickets
to this charity cocktail gala.

07:07.856 --> 07:10.569
It's at Candice Carter's house.

07:10.925 --> 07:13.280
She has more money than God. Yeah.

07:13.281 --> 07:17.045
"More money than God."

07:17.046 --> 07:18.401
I know who she is.

07:18.402 --> 07:21.789
She's been waffling between
Fenmore and Suntrust for months,

07:21.790 --> 07:22.982
and I've tried signing her,

07:22.983 --> 07:24.828
but she's a bitch billionaire

07:24.829 --> 07:26.596
with a thing against women. So...

07:26.597 --> 07:28.906
What does that mean? It means trash it.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.406
There's no point in going.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.390
Look, until I sort things out

07:32.391 --> 07:34.719
with Sam's boarding
school, I'm stuck with him,

07:36.209 --> 07:38.372
and I can't leave him
home alone that long.

07:38.373 --> 07:40.459
Emma, he's 16 years old.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.655
It's like a couple of
hours. It only takes him

07:42.656 --> 07:44.556
a couple of seconds to
raid my medicine cabinet

07:44.557 --> 07:46.628
and snort all my dexatrim.

07:46.876 --> 07:48.368
I learned that the hard way.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.388
All right, look...

07:52.185 --> 07:53.321
Here's the thing.

07:53.804 --> 07:56.383
I told you about Lux's mri.

07:56.384 --> 07:57.481
Well, there's going to be

07:57.482 --> 08:00.294
doctor bills and specialist people and...

08:01.744 --> 08:03.259
I don't want to be the deadbeat dad

08:03.260 --> 08:04.720
who can't pay for any of it.

08:04.721 --> 08:06.929
So if I help land this client,

08:06.930 --> 08:09.116
maybe I could share the bonus with you?

08:11.421 --> 08:12.273
Come on.

08:13.398 --> 08:14.511
Please.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.943
I can even find something
to keep Sam occupied.

08:21.944 --> 08:23.358
We'll go, we'll sign moneybags

08:23.359 --> 08:26.473
and I will have you home
before Sam has a chance

08:26.474 --> 08:28.306
to snort anything.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.397
Fine, fine.

08:32.633 --> 08:36.541
Okay, this is interesting. See there?

08:36.542 --> 08:39.629
That tiny spot? It's evidence

08:39.630 --> 08:41.905
that at some point that
small part of the brain

08:41.905 --> 08:43.393
lost blood flow.

08:44.328 --> 08:46.632
You suffered a stroke.

08:48.457 --> 08:51.554
Kids don't have strokes.
Grandparents have strokes.

08:51.555 --> 08:53.443
I see in Lux's files

08:53.444 --> 08:55.227
she was born with a heart defect.

08:55.228 --> 08:57.284
Mm-hmm. Which she had repaired.

08:57.285 --> 08:59.813
I think there's a chance
this may be related.

08:59.814 --> 09:02.411
Sometimes, after cardiac surgery,

09:02.412 --> 09:04.839
a blood clot can develop in the heart.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.387
And if there's trauma,

09:06.388 --> 09:08.537
that clot could have broken off

09:08.538 --> 09:11.527
and traveled up to the
brain, causing a stroke.

09:11.528 --> 09:13.963
Lux, the pronounced change in your writing

09:13.964 --> 09:15.876
in junior high, makes
me believe that this is

09:15.877 --> 09:17.244
when this happened.

09:17.245 --> 09:19.796
Do you remember anything
specific from that time?

09:21.810 --> 09:26.912
Besides government cheese and
some minor shoplifting, no.

09:26.913 --> 09:28.806
Did you play any sports
where you may have been

09:28.807 --> 09:31.834
knocked in the chest? Do
you recall any injuries?

09:33.536 --> 09:37.070
Uh, no, no, nothing.

09:37.986 --> 09:39.428
You two don't remember anything?

09:39.429 --> 09:40.400
Perhaps a call

09:40.401 --> 09:41.709
from the school nurse?

09:41.710 --> 09:44.287
She was still in foster care, so, um...

09:44.288 --> 09:45.780
Where were you living then?

09:45.781 --> 09:48.494
Um... at sunnyvale.

09:48.792 --> 09:50.345
And nothing happened?

09:50.346 --> 09:51.638
Just take a second and think.

09:51.639 --> 09:53.474
I don't remember anything.

09:55.591 --> 09:56.640
I'm sorry.

10:11.466 --> 10:15.671
***

10:17.352 --> 10:19.226
there's something that she's not saying.

10:19.227 --> 10:20.980
Well, we can't press her, Cate.

10:20.981 --> 10:22.708
No, I'm supposed to
press her. I'm her mom.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.572
I'm supposed to know things and I don't.

10:24.573 --> 10:26.742
Whatever happened, we can't change it.

10:26.743 --> 10:30.326
So what matters now is that
we figure this thing out

10:30.327 --> 10:31.664
and we're here to take care of it.

10:31.665 --> 10:32.822
I know. You're right.

10:32.823 --> 10:34.431
I just don't know my kid,

10:34.432 --> 10:35.821
I don't know why I married my husband.

10:35.822 --> 10:38.333
I feel like I've just suddenly woken up

10:38.334 --> 10:40.257
in someone else's life.

10:40.258 --> 10:41.400
Here you go.

10:42.236 --> 10:44.603
Um, so this is going to be covered, right,

10:44.604 --> 10:45.650
like by our insurance?

10:45.651 --> 10:47.899
You can try submitting it after you pay,

10:47.900 --> 10:49.553
but I wouldn't hold my breath.

10:49.554 --> 10:51.210
I'm doing this. No, Baze, I got it.

10:51.211 --> 10:53.140
You can't afford it. I'm on
the verge of a huge bonus.

10:53.141 --> 10:55.073
Put your card away. I got it.

10:55.074 --> 10:57.427
Cate, I'm her dad, okay?

10:57.428 --> 10:59.098
And that's what dads do... they provide.

10:59.099 --> 11:01.247
So you want to worry about the past, okay,

11:01.248 --> 11:02.056
and that's your thing,

11:02.057 --> 11:04.276
but I want to take care of
what's happening right now.

11:07.955 --> 11:10.794
It's just a lot to process, Lux.

11:11.214 --> 11:14.423
You had a stroke in seventh grade,

11:14.424 --> 11:16.159
but now you're fine?

11:16.160 --> 11:19.188
Yes, the doctor said
I'm fine, so it's fine.

11:20.435 --> 11:21.534
You sure?

11:22.141 --> 11:24.493
Because that's really scary, Lux.

11:24.494 --> 11:29.348
Okay, all right, let's
focus on homecoming.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.296
How high school is this dress?

11:34.025 --> 11:35.143
Well, since you're going

11:35.144 --> 11:37.547
to a high school dance, allegedly,

11:38.310 --> 11:41.118
I'd say it's a very fitting disguise.

11:45.776 --> 11:48.559
Wow, Eric is going all out.

11:48.636 --> 11:50.900
Thank you for letting
us use your place, Tasha.

11:51.397 --> 11:54.097
He didn't tell me his plan
included pink balloons.

11:54.098 --> 11:55.681
And crepe paper.

11:57.447 --> 11:59.524
If Cate finds out, I'm
gonna lose my apartment.

12:00.015 --> 12:01.525
You know that, right?

12:01.526 --> 12:03.678
Don't worry. I'm gonna go to
the dance with you and Jones,

12:03.679 --> 12:04.933
and then I'll be back before they

12:04.934 --> 12:06.631
hand out the p

12:08.627 --> 12:09.628
thank you for checking.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.859
I'll just, I'll call when she's back. Bye.

12:11.860 --> 12:14.837
Hey. Oh, look at you guys!

12:14.838 --> 12:17.300
Lux, that dress is adorable.

12:18.135 --> 12:19.832
It's totally high school.

12:21.328 --> 12:22.715
I'm changing.

12:22.716 --> 12:24.099
Here, try this one.

12:25.237 --> 12:26.078
Yellow?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.352
Yes, yellow!

12:27.353 --> 12:29.104
Lux, you know, I was just trying to find

12:29.105 --> 12:31.506
your medical records
from junior high school.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.301
And, um, fern's out of town,

12:34.302 --> 12:36.407
so I called sunnyvale, but nothing.

12:36.408 --> 12:37.804
Sunnyvale only keeps records

12:37.805 --> 12:39.689
from when you actually lived there.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.672
I thought you were
living at sunnyvale then.

12:44.057 --> 12:45.126
I was.

12:46.153 --> 12:48.164
Sorry. I was thinking about me.

12:50.170 --> 12:50.970
I'll get it.

13:01.977 --> 13:02.981
What was that about?

13:02.982 --> 13:04.245
What? Oh, nothing.

13:05.372 --> 13:06.270
Tasha...

13:08.783 --> 13:11.012
For Lux's sake, if you know something...

13:14.374 --> 13:15.647
I don't.

13:17.087 --> 13:20.573
But, um, I can give you the address

13:20.574 --> 13:22.529
of someone who might.

13:31.550 --> 13:32.667
Coming.

13:34.263 --> 13:35.244
Hi. Hi!

13:35.245 --> 13:36.070
How are you?

13:37.702 --> 13:38.971
Uh, hi.

13:41.176 --> 13:42.335
Lux...

13:42.935 --> 13:44.438
You remember Emma.

13:44.940 --> 13:46.279
Well, this, um,

13:46.535 --> 13:47.975
this is her son Sam.

13:48.178 --> 13:49.262
You have a son?

13:49.263 --> 13:50.535
Long story.

13:50.536 --> 13:52.357
Sam, Lux.

13:52.358 --> 13:54.220
It's a longer story.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.435
But good news.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.349
You have a date for homecoming.

13:58.350 --> 13:59.200
What?

13:59.201 --> 14:01.337
Yeah. Well, Cate told
me you were going alone.

14:02.945 --> 14:04.557
Well, now you don't have to.

14:09.233 --> 14:10.838
Do you remember when you were the new kid

14:10.839 --> 14:12.057
on the block, how good it felt

14:12.058 --> 14:14.132
when all the other kids,
they reached out to you?

14:14.133 --> 14:15.865
No, because they didn't.

14:15.866 --> 14:17.617
It's a lot to ask, yeah.

14:17.618 --> 14:18.886
I know... no, Baze.

14:18.887 --> 14:20.690
But listen, listen.

14:20.691 --> 14:22.787
I need this, okay?

14:22.788 --> 14:24.271
He needs this.

14:24.272 --> 14:26.905
Just think of it like it's a good deed.

14:26.906 --> 14:28.634
You know, like when you donate your hair

14:28.635 --> 14:30.635
or you hang out with old people.

14:30.636 --> 14:33.475
Okay. It makes you feel good inside, Lux.

14:33.476 --> 14:34.342
Okay, you know what?

14:34.343 --> 14:36.100
You're gonna be there anyway, right?

14:37.642 --> 14:39.740
Hmm? So, what's the difference?

14:45.877 --> 14:46.709
Fine.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.061
Fine, fine. Thanks,
thanks. You're the best.

14:49.062 --> 14:49.769
All right.

14:50.942 --> 14:53.221
Okay, you have nothing to worry about

14:53.222 --> 14:56.850
because Lux is a super
responsible kid, okay?

15:01.822 --> 15:03.016
Have fun, kids.

15:03.017 --> 15:03.719
Bye.

15:06.294 --> 15:07.359
Well...

15:08.303 --> 15:09.532
I guess we'll just...

15:10.010 --> 15:11.855
Have to make the best out of this.

15:11.856 --> 15:13.138
Agreed.

15:14.691 --> 15:17.437
Mind if I peruse your
mom's medicine cabinet?

15:33.781 --> 15:36.064
I can't believe you got me this.

15:36.065 --> 15:38.875
Jones takes all the new
girls to their first dance.

15:38.876 --> 15:40.134
Oh, what a guy.

15:42.379 --> 15:43.778
Hey, do you got any bud?

15:43.779 --> 15:45.589
Uh, no. I don't do drugs, man.

15:45.590 --> 15:47.392
Oh, wow. I didn't think

15:47.393 --> 15:49.909
you could possibly be even
lamer than you look. Congrats.

15:54.937 --> 15:57.996
I really hope Baze is paying
you to babysit his ass.

15:57.997 --> 16:00.063
Great smiles. Oh, you look beautiful.

16:02.351 --> 16:03.768
Uh, you know what, guys? Go ahead.

16:03.769 --> 16:06.253
I'm just gonna make a
quick phone call to someone.

16:06.254 --> 16:08.392
Oh. I'll wait here for you.

16:08.393 --> 16:09.705
Since you're my babysitter

16:09.706 --> 16:10.808
and all, you probably shouldn't

16:10.809 --> 16:12.436
let me out of your sight, right?

16:14.295 --> 16:15.402
Never mind.

16:16.057 --> 16:17.093
Forget it.

16:21.118 --> 16:22.170
There she is.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.311
Whoa.

16:29.309 --> 16:30.171
Her family's money comes

16:30.172 --> 16:31.733
from taking large equity stakes

16:31.734 --> 16:33.230
in oil explorate Bazile.

16:33.231 --> 16:34.708
They made their fortune by taking risks,

16:34.709 --> 16:36.472
so don't be shy in taking some now. Okay.

16:36.473 --> 16:38.992
Let's not bore her by
talking fixed income.

16:38.993 --> 16:40.312
All right, you got it.

16:40.313 --> 16:41.669
Don't be boring.

16:43.055 --> 16:45.613
Candy, lovely party.

16:46.915 --> 16:48.451
Amy, right?

16:48.452 --> 16:51.163
Emma... bradshaw.

16:51.164 --> 16:53.067
And this is Nate Bazile. Hi.

16:53.068 --> 16:53.995
Hi. How are you?

16:53.996 --> 16:55.541
Thank you for having us. Sure.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.329
That is a cool piano.

16:57.330 --> 16:59.545
I bet you've had a lot fun on that thing.

17:00.964 --> 17:02.049
Excuse me?

17:02.863 --> 17:04.888
I meant playing it.

17:04.890 --> 17:07.515
Well, I don't play. I mean, I wish I did.

17:07.516 --> 17:09.476
Because this guy that
my assistant hired is

17:09.477 --> 17:10.872
boring my pants off.

17:12.142 --> 17:14.636
Um, I used to have a piano.

17:14.637 --> 17:16.722
It burned up when my bar burned down.

17:17.259 --> 17:20.176
So I don't have one anymore.

17:20.178 --> 17:21.526
Really?

17:23.011 --> 17:25.934
So, candy, it's, it's wonderful to see

17:25.935 --> 17:27.320
how invested you are in charity,

17:27.321 --> 17:28.406
how much you've given.

17:28.407 --> 17:29.969
Are you any good?

17:30.351 --> 17:33.303
Well, my repertoire is not
what you would call classy,

17:33.304 --> 17:35.395
but I mean, if you want...

17:35.396 --> 17:36.886
I like "not classy."

17:39.381 --> 17:43.496
Eyes eyes baby, hmm

17:43.497 --> 17:48.192
eyes eyes baby, hmm

17:48.193 --> 17:50.649
eyes eyes baby

17:50.650 --> 17:52.803
hey, Eric, it's me.

17:53.704 --> 17:55.623
Um, I need you to call me
back as soon as you get this.

17:55.624 --> 17:58.649
I'm so sorry, but I'm not gonna
be able to make it tonight.

17:59.283 --> 18:01.002
What, are you stalking me now?

18:01.003 --> 18:03.037
What's with all the secretive phone calls?

18:05.826 --> 18:07.384
Relax, cinderella.

18:07.385 --> 18:09.420
Sorry I crashed your ball.

18:10.746 --> 18:13.441
But the good news is...

18:13.604 --> 18:15.292
I found a hook-up.

18:15.293 --> 18:16.391
What?

18:20.445 --> 18:22.041
Minnesota? What does that mean?

18:22.042 --> 18:23.699
Is the whole state calling you?

18:26.279 --> 18:27.105
Hello.

18:27.712 --> 18:30.792
Hey, um, sorry, I-I can't really talk,

18:30.793 --> 18:32.424
but I'm stuck at homecoming...

18:32.425 --> 18:34.170
Who's that, your boyfriend?

18:34.171 --> 18:35.343
No one.

18:35.753 --> 18:37.603
Yeah, yeah, can I just call you later?

18:37.604 --> 18:40.000
Okay, all right. Bye.

18:40.492 --> 18:42.593
So that's why you're pissed off, huh?

18:43.438 --> 18:44.466
You were gonna ditch the dance

18:44.467 --> 18:46.141
to go sneak off with your boyfriend,

18:46.142 --> 18:49.289
but instead you got stuck here with me?

18:49.908 --> 18:51.799
Here, take a hit.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.253
Maybe it'll help retract your claws.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.679
You know what? Screw you
and your stupid joint!

18:57.680 --> 18:59.007
Lux?

19:22.252 --> 19:23.858
Hi. Can I help you?

19:23.859 --> 19:26.608
Yeah, I'm looking for
some information on a child

19:26.609 --> 19:29.281
that you fostered a few years ago.

19:29.803 --> 19:31.180
Whatever you want should be on file.

19:31.181 --> 19:33.115
Caseworkers are supposed
to go through the state.

19:33.116 --> 19:34.376
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

19:34.377 --> 19:35.704
I'm not a caseworker.

19:35.705 --> 19:37.633
I'm Lux Cassidy's mom.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.362
They don't know exactly what happened;

19:49.363 --> 19:51.129
what triggered the disability.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.343
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to find out.

19:54.077 --> 19:55.597
Uh, the doctor thinks it could've been

19:55.598 --> 19:58.050
from some sort of physical trauma.

19:58.051 --> 19:59.068
A car accident?

19:59.069 --> 20:02.467
Anything that was jarring or violent.

20:03.107 --> 20:04.811
Did you ask Lux about it?

20:04.812 --> 20:06.194
Yeah, I did,

20:07.979 --> 20:09.379
but, um, you know, she
didn't want to talk about it.

20:09.380 --> 20:11.453
Which made me worry even more.

20:11.454 --> 20:13.248
In fact, she told me that she was

20:13.249 --> 20:14.825
living at sunnyvale in junior high.

20:14.826 --> 20:17.430
But tasha... her best friend...

20:17.431 --> 20:20.976
told me that Lux was living here.

20:21.611 --> 20:24.695
Oh, I see.

20:26.622 --> 20:30.454
Did Lux tell you that Tasha
was living here recently?

20:30.455 --> 20:32.380
That I was fostering her?

20:32.381 --> 20:36.326
That the two of them graffitied my house?

20:36.947 --> 20:38.245
What? No.

20:40.539 --> 20:44.086
Lux said that the family
that Tasha was living with

20:44.087 --> 20:45.361
changed their mind

20:47.312 --> 20:48.959
and they didn't want her.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.093
And I'm sure if you ask
Lux about her time here,

20:51.094 --> 20:54.360
she'd say the same thing, but
my husband and I wanted Lux

20:54.361 --> 20:56.628
just as much as we wanted Tasha.

20:56.629 --> 20:57.496
More.

20:59.353 --> 21:00.062
Lux...

21:02.610 --> 21:04.643
She was like a daughter to me.

21:12.783 --> 21:14.198
Yay!

21:14.253 --> 21:15.309
All right, we're done with this.

21:15.310 --> 21:17.190
I can't believe that
people actually tipped me.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.011
Oh, come on. You're worth it.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.978
Your rendition of the wu
tang clan was masterful.

21:22.510 --> 21:23.541
It is a gift.

21:24.718 --> 21:25.285
Um, you know what?

21:25.286 --> 21:27.304
I would like to give this to the charity.

21:27.305 --> 21:30.671
That's amazing. All... hmm... $17.

21:31.299 --> 21:33.024
This is very generous. Thank you.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.042
Uh, well, you know, every dollar counts.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.649
That is the original
mantra of investing...

21:38.324 --> 21:42.168
Which we should probably talk about,

21:42.169 --> 21:44.867
which is why I'm here

21:45.184 --> 21:46.687
we don't need to.

21:47.080 --> 21:50.034
Look, I read that portfolio
that Amy sent over.

21:50.035 --> 21:51.498
It's very impressive.

21:51.499 --> 21:53.573
And I would've signed
with Fenmore a while ago,

21:53.574 --> 21:55.166
if her skinny ass hadn't kept trying

21:55.167 --> 21:56.759
to shove it down my throat.

21:57.184 --> 21:58.509
See, I don't know what it is about her.

21:58.510 --> 22:03.895
She just has this aggression,
like she hates women.

22:05.085 --> 22:07.200
All right, well, if you

22:07.201 --> 22:10.201
sign with Fenmore, you will
also be signing with me.

22:10.978 --> 22:14.486
And I can assure you, I don't hate women.

22:16.865 --> 22:19.219
I'll come by the office on Monday.

22:20.722 --> 22:21.916
All right.

22:25.091 --> 22:25.900
Awesome.

22:26.430 --> 22:27.338
Okay.

22:27.633 --> 22:28.891
That's it, we're leaving.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.242
Uh... wow.

22:30.243 --> 22:32.119
Okay. We're leaving.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.559
Okay. Awesome. Thank you.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.972
Thank you for saving my party.

22:34.973 --> 22:36.291
My-my pleasure.

22:36.292 --> 22:37.687
See you Monday. Bye-bye.

22:37.688 --> 22:39.317
Ah, she agreed to sign.

22:39.318 --> 22:42.126
I don't care what she agreed to do.

22:42.127 --> 22:43.802
Flying off solo, flirting,

22:43.803 --> 22:46.932
staring at fake boobs... that
is not how we do business!

22:46.933 --> 22:47.801
Whoa.

22:48.591 --> 22:49.769
W-why not?

22:50.173 --> 22:52.379
It worked, didn't it, Amy?

22:54.740 --> 22:56.164
Okay, all right. You're upset.

22:56.165 --> 22:58.024
I see that. But you didn't even
want this client, all right?

22:58.025 --> 22:59.473
This was my idea. And you know how much

22:59.474 --> 23:02.003
I need this bonus, for Lux.

23:02.333 --> 23:04.478
Oh... so all that inappropriateness,

23:04.479 --> 23:06.147
that was for Lux?

23:06.148 --> 23:09.402
'Cause whoring yourself out
really is a great way to parent.

23:10.307 --> 23:11.112
All right.

23:11.410 --> 23:13.696
It's better than shipping your
kid off to a boarding school

23:13.697 --> 23:15.951
because you clearly don't
know how to deal with him.

23:17.088 --> 23:17.985
You know what, I would spend

23:17.986 --> 23:19.318
a little more time getting to know my kid

23:19.319 --> 23:21.404
before you start giving me advice on mine.

23:26.239 --> 23:27.375
I just can't believe this.

23:27.376 --> 23:30.402
I mean, this is all
from when Lux lived here?

23:34.568 --> 23:35.989
This is my favorite.

23:36.594 --> 23:38.009
It's from my birthday.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.469
She doesn't even call me mom.

23:46.037 --> 23:47.542
You know, Cate, there may be a reason

23:47.543 --> 23:50.700
why Lux never told you
she was living here.

23:53.508 --> 23:55.384
There was a violent incident.

23:55.385 --> 23:57.027
It's just...

23:57.398 --> 23:59.644
The one who was violent was Lux.

23:59.645 --> 24:00.584
What?

24:00.987 --> 24:02.895
She was fine when she first came here.

24:03.402 --> 24:05.908
And I was always trying to
make up for the life she led

24:05.909 --> 24:07.627
before she got to me.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.062
But... it was like

24:10.063 --> 24:12.139
I could never do enough for her.

24:12.551 --> 24:14.626
The harder I tried to connect to her,

24:15.883 --> 24:17.804
the more she lashed out at me.

24:18.317 --> 24:19.858
What do you mean "lashed out"?

24:20.994 --> 24:22.539
She hit my husband.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.330
She hurt him badly.

24:26.621 --> 24:29.147
She told lie upon lie...

24:30.012 --> 24:33.477
And, I mean, sounds like she still does.

24:34.770 --> 24:35.862
There's nothing worse

24:35.863 --> 24:38.147
than not being able to trust
the people that you love.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.042
I'm-I'm sorry.

24:46.686 --> 24:47.793
Hello.

24:55.929 --> 24:56.734
It wasn't me.

24:56.735 --> 24:58.665
I-I wasn't the one who was smoking.

24:58.666 --> 25:00.592
Thanks for the solidarity.

25:00.593 --> 25:02.677
I only took his joint to put it out.

25:06.696 --> 25:07.382
Go wait in the car.

25:07.383 --> 25:08.908
I want to talk to Lux.

25:08.909 --> 25:09.694
What?!

25:09.973 --> 25:12.621
You just gave a total
pothead your car keys.

25:16.891 --> 25:18.223
Who is this?

25:23.010 --> 25:24.849
Did you go through my stuff?

25:25.941 --> 25:26.939
I went to Valerie's.

25:26.940 --> 25:28.689
Tasha gave me the address.

25:29.883 --> 25:30.537
What?

25:30.538 --> 25:31.845
I know everything.

25:31.846 --> 25:33.160
I know that Tasha lived there.

25:33.161 --> 25:35.255
I know what you guys did
to get her kicked out.

25:35.256 --> 25:37.277
I know what happened when
you were living there.

25:37.278 --> 25:39.888
And what did Valerie tell you?

25:40.392 --> 25:42.068
That you pushed them away.

25:43.929 --> 25:45.325
You know, that you were violent with them,

25:45.326 --> 25:47.113
that you hit her husband,

25:47.114 --> 25:49.561
that you were lying constantly.

25:49.562 --> 25:52.897
All of this time, you have
said that nobody wanted you,

25:52.898 --> 25:53.905
that you were all alone.

25:53.906 --> 25:56.479
And I went over there, and
I saw cards and pictures

25:56.480 --> 25:57.959
and letters.

25:59.395 --> 26:02.072
Valerie... I mean, she-she wanted you.

26:02.073 --> 26:03.362
She loved you, Lux.

26:03.363 --> 26:04.881
And you believed her?

26:04.882 --> 26:06.763
You only knew her for,
what, like, two seconds?

26:06.764 --> 26:07.927
I'm not saying that I believe her,

26:07.928 --> 26:10.417
I am just saying that I
don't know what to believe.

26:10.418 --> 26:13.762
Because every time I turn
around, you are lying to me.

26:15.616 --> 26:17.608
I just want to know the truth.

26:17.609 --> 26:20.739
You know, whatever it is,
if you could just tell me.

26:22.219 --> 26:22.983
Well, it seems like

26:22.984 --> 26:24.847
you've already got the truth from Valerie.

26:38.151 --> 26:39.628
This is insane, right?

26:39.629 --> 26:41.076
Homecoming court?

26:41.077 --> 26:42.867
I feel like we're in a John Hughes film,

26:42.868 --> 26:44.980
in a very, very good way.

26:44.981 --> 26:46.600
You look cute in a tiara.

26:46.601 --> 26:47.360
Come on.

26:49.818 --> 26:52.117
Hey, Lux, look, it's homecoming court.

26:52.118 --> 26:53.501
Can you believe it?

26:55.581 --> 26:57.520
Lux. Lux.

26:57.521 --> 26:58.518
Lux, wait.

26:58.519 --> 26:59.885
You told Cate.

26:59.886 --> 27:02.024
You told her about Valerie.

27:02.025 --> 27:04.309
Lux, Cate was worried about you.

27:04.633 --> 27:06.830
Okay? And I'm worried about you.

27:07.102 --> 27:08.894
And she knew that you
were hiding something.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.514
And you are, right?

27:10.756 --> 27:12.468
That's why you didn't
want me living there.

27:14.790 --> 27:16.476
She told Cate that it was me.

27:17.540 --> 27:19.498
That I was the one who hurt them,

27:19.499 --> 27:22.123
which is total crap, okay?

27:22.124 --> 27:22.948
They hurt me.

27:22.949 --> 27:24.853
Valerie knows exactly what happened.

27:24.854 --> 27:26.181
Lux, wait!

27:26.684 --> 27:28.920
Wait. Talk to me, please!

27:29.644 --> 27:30.747
Get out of the car.

27:30.748 --> 27:32.403
What? No.

27:32.404 --> 27:34.925
Get out of the damn car!

27:34.926 --> 27:37.644
I'm not getting out of the car
till your mom takes me home.

27:38.509 --> 27:39.579
Fine.

27:40.925 --> 27:43.170
You know you can't drive, right?

27:43.171 --> 27:45.694
Whoa, you don't, you don't have a license?

27:55.069 --> 27:57.725
Where the hell are we?
You need to take me home.

27:58.245 --> 27:59.261
Wait here.

28:00.109 --> 28:01.436
I'm not waiting in the car.

28:01.437 --> 28:04.071
You wanted to stay in the
car, so stay in the stupid car!

28:04.072 --> 28:05.313
Why are we here, Lux?

28:05.314 --> 28:06.373
What are you doing?

28:15.462 --> 28:16.425
Lux.

28:16.426 --> 28:18.475
I'm the violent one?

28:18.804 --> 28:20.109
That's what you told Cate?

28:20.110 --> 28:21.482
Lux... I can't even believe you.

28:21.483 --> 28:23.611
I finally have a real
mom, and what do you do?

28:23.612 --> 28:25.469
You-you sabotage it!

28:25.470 --> 28:27.099
God, you haven't screwed
me enough already?

28:27.100 --> 28:28.954
You have to screw me over again?

28:28.955 --> 28:29.936
You should go.

28:29.937 --> 28:31.593
This is the reason it didn't work out.

28:31.594 --> 28:33.075
Oh, I'm the reason?

28:33.076 --> 28:34.671
I'm the problem?

28:34.977 --> 28:37.325
Yeah, I hit your stupid-ass husband,

28:37.326 --> 28:39.435
but what about what he did to me?

28:39.436 --> 28:40.183
I didn't just

28:40.184 --> 28:42.254
push myself down a flight of stairs!

28:42.255 --> 28:44.718
I didn't just punch myself in the chest!

28:44.719 --> 28:46.745
I think you're confused
and you're troubled,

28:46.746 --> 28:48.263
just like you were when you lived here.

28:48.264 --> 28:49.204
What the hell?!

28:51.130 --> 28:52.175
You think you can just show up here

28:52.176 --> 28:54.152
and yell at my wife? Trey...

28:54.153 --> 28:55.644
This isn't about you.

28:55.645 --> 28:57.406
Get off my property.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.046
Get the hell off my property.

29:09.135 --> 29:10.658
Get away from her!

29:12.591 --> 29:13.901
Stay away from me.

29:13.902 --> 29:15.783
Stay away from my family!

29:15.784 --> 29:16.703
You hear me?

29:24.369 --> 29:25.192
Lux, run.

29:27.728 --> 29:29.680
Trey? Trey?

29:29.681 --> 29:31.482
The car, Lux... start
the car, start the car.

29:31.483 --> 29:33.131
Okay, I will, I will!

29:35.640 --> 29:36.845
What the hell was that?! We're fine.

29:36.846 --> 29:38.175
Just go. No, we're not.

29:38.176 --> 29:40.643
You just hit a guy with
a shovel! Sam, shut up!

29:41.967 --> 29:42.813
Somebody!

29:49.243 --> 29:50.577
Let me out of the car.

29:50.578 --> 29:51.535
Let me out of the car!

29:51.536 --> 29:52.673
Sam, shut up!

29:52.674 --> 29:54.772
Lux, I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?

29:54.773 --> 29:55.467
I don't know!

29:55.468 --> 29:56.987
Not hit him over the head with a shovel!

29:56.988 --> 29:59.108
I mean, he was moving, right?

29:59.109 --> 30:00.159
I know he was moving.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.115
He was fine. Right.

30:01.116 --> 30:02.036
Lux, he wouldn't let you go.

30:02.037 --> 30:03.191
He was hurting you. Yeah, no...

30:03.192 --> 30:04.433
what if they call the cops or what if

30:04.434 --> 30:06.522
you get sent back to juvie, Tasha?!

30:06.523 --> 30:07.746
Back to juvie?

30:07.747 --> 30:08.944
You've been in juvie?

30:08.945 --> 30:10.622
This-this is crazy. Sam!

30:10.623 --> 30:11.428
Look, Sam, I will let you

30:11.429 --> 30:12.411
out of the car!

30:12.412 --> 30:13.326
Just stop!

30:13.327 --> 30:14.876
Just hold on!

30:14.877 --> 30:16.007
Lux, Lux!

30:34.100 --> 30:34.859
Hey, you.

30:34.860 --> 30:36.693
Ryan, I'm so sorry.

30:37.205 --> 30:38.192
I'm sorry, I just... whoa, wait, wait.

30:38.193 --> 30:40.126
Lux, hold on. Just calm-calm down.

30:40.127 --> 30:41.647
I don't know where we are.

30:41.648 --> 30:43.515
Can you just get me,
please? Yeah. No, look...

30:43.516 --> 30:44.813
okay, look, no, just stay there.

30:44.814 --> 30:46.117
No, as long as you're okay.

30:46.118 --> 30:47.603
All right, look, I'm on my way.

30:49.188 --> 30:50.931
You know, I didn't even want to be here!

30:50.932 --> 30:53.474
This is seriously screwed
up, Lux, you know that?!

31:02.057 --> 31:02.952
Lux...

31:03.368 --> 31:05.364
I'm sorry.

31:06.639 --> 31:08.428
Lux, I don't know what happened, okay?

31:08.429 --> 31:10.098
But whatever those people did to you,

31:10.099 --> 31:12.520
whatever I did, I am so sorry.

31:12.521 --> 31:15.484
No one can know what happened tonight, t.

31:19.739 --> 31:20.628
Promise.

31:20.995 --> 31:22.063
Okay, I promise.

31:24.560 --> 31:26.324
Yeah, just hurry, okay?

31:26.325 --> 31:26.864
Thanks.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.880
Um, okay, so that was Ryan.

31:30.168 --> 31:31.859
Lux called him, and, um,

31:32.359 --> 31:34.023
they're on their way over, but...

31:34.385 --> 31:38.685
Um, apparently, she crashed my car.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.374
Oh, I cannot believe this.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.335
I guess I'll be bumming rides

31:46.336 --> 31:48.023
from you for a little while now

31:48.275 --> 31:50.105
no, I understand.

31:50.415 --> 31:52.655
What happened to your kid
being the responsible one

31:52.656 --> 31:54.594
and that Sam would be safe with her?

31:55.327 --> 31:58.285
Um, I thought that he would be.

31:58.555 --> 32:01.271
This-this isn't, this isn't like Lux.

32:01.575 --> 32:02.667
I don't know.

32:03.126 --> 32:04.012
Maybe it is.

32:04.013 --> 32:04.959
I just feel like there is

32:04.960 --> 32:07.278
a lot about her that we don't know, Baze.

32:07.897 --> 32:08.958
Good to know I'm not the only one

32:08.959 --> 32:10.581
who doesn't know between us.

32:25.123 --> 32:26.435
Ryan, thank you.

32:28.390 --> 32:30.998
Wait, where's Tasha?

32:31.483 --> 32:32.239
I took her home.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.320
She's okay.

32:33.931 --> 32:36.345
Your car is definitely not.

32:36.346 --> 32:38.173
It's okay. I don't
really care about my car.

32:38.174 --> 32:39.169
I just...

32:39.858 --> 32:40.434
I care about

32:40.435 --> 32:42.697
what is going on between us.

32:46.052 --> 32:48.278
Hey... let go of me!

32:51.741 --> 32:53.161
What is going on?

32:53.162 --> 32:54.898
You want to know what's going on?

32:54.899 --> 32:56.613
Here's what's going on.

32:56.614 --> 32:58.085
You can't figure out why everything is

32:58.086 --> 32:59.391
so screwed up with you and Ryan,

32:59.392 --> 33:00.457
so you're putting

33:00.458 --> 33:02.532
all your neurotic,
psychotic attention on me,

33:02.533 --> 33:04.014
and-and I don't want it.

33:04.015 --> 33:06.504
Look, I just want to
understand what is going on,

33:06.505 --> 33:07.599
because I want to help you.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.003
There's nothing to understand, Cate.

33:09.004 --> 33:10.154
Yes, there is.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.977
Yes. I mean, you're...

33:12.440 --> 33:13.899
You're just becoming this kid

33:13.900 --> 33:16.303
that, that lies and steals my car,

33:16.304 --> 33:17.731
you're cheating, I just feel like

33:17.732 --> 33:20.423
I don't even know or trust you anymore.

33:21.127 --> 33:23.198
I haven't... become this kid, Cate.

33:23.199 --> 33:24.522
Isn't that what you want to hear?

33:24.523 --> 33:26.793
That I was already like
this when, when you got me,

33:26.794 --> 33:28.637
that-that this isn't your fault?

33:28.638 --> 33:30.071
Lux didn't steal the car.

33:30.594 --> 33:31.828
I-I did.

33:34.376 --> 33:35.371
What?

33:36.392 --> 33:38.396
She's just trying to protect me, you know?

33:38.397 --> 33:39.681
I'm the one who took it.

33:40.818 --> 33:41.832
I was already in trouble, and

33:41.833 --> 33:42.671
I wanted to get out of there,

33:42.672 --> 33:44.571
and Lux and Tasha tried to stop me, but...

33:44.572 --> 33:46.394
When I wouldn't, they got in.

33:46.688 --> 33:47.772
I'm sorry I crashed your car,

33:47.773 --> 33:50.558
but you can lay off Lux, all right?

33:51.271 --> 33:52.924
I'm sure my mom will confirm it.

33:52.925 --> 33:54.860
The only screwup here is me.

34:21.248 --> 34:22.408
How's Lux?

34:23.239 --> 34:26.753
Honestly, I... I don't know.

34:27.844 --> 34:30.326
Well, she'll talk to
you, Cate. Eventually.

34:31.165 --> 34:33.299
The answers that you need,
they'll, they'll come.

34:34.222 --> 34:35.216
I know.

34:36.375 --> 34:39.797
I know, now, why I married you.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.527
I mean, yeah, I loved you.

34:43.529 --> 34:45.344
I wanted to be with you, but...

34:45.346 --> 34:47.661
I wasn't really looking to get married.

34:48.498 --> 34:50.928
You know, I didn't need
that to be with you.

34:51.264 --> 34:54.567
And I-I remember sitting
here, in this booth,

34:54.568 --> 34:56.773
the day after Lux found me.

34:57.484 --> 34:58.999
You asked me to marry you.

34:59.000 --> 34:59.602
Mm-hmm.

35:06.442 --> 35:08.838
I didn't think that I
could do it on my own.

35:09.309 --> 35:11.718
I just, I didn't think that
I could take care of her.

35:13.485 --> 35:16.157
I knew that I couldn't rely on Baze,

35:16.455 --> 35:18.034
so I relied on you.

35:19.154 --> 35:22.905
I did then, and I... I still do.

35:22.906 --> 35:24.125
I mean, Ryan, I mean...

35:24.126 --> 35:25.379
you are the one that
she called last night.

35:25.380 --> 35:27.547
She didn't call me or Baze.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.323
You know, that means something.

35:29.324 --> 35:32.166
We both need you. I mean, I need you.

35:35.025 --> 35:37.132
Look, I will always be there for Lux.

35:39.359 --> 35:40.571
But I don't want that to be the reason

35:40.572 --> 35:42.465
why you and I stay married.

35:44.624 --> 35:47.058
We are going to find our own reasons.

35:47.329 --> 35:50.247
You know, we... we are
going to find our way back.

35:51.653 --> 35:53.683
We're going to figure this out, right?

35:58.983 --> 36:00.758
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

36:14.645 --> 36:15.635
Hey.

36:16.806 --> 36:17.968
You alone?

36:18.272 --> 36:20.390
I dropped Sam off at school.

36:21.419 --> 36:23.195
Oh, don't worry, not boarding school.

36:23.196 --> 36:25.118
I didn't ship him off again.

36:30.753 --> 36:31.849
Okay.

36:32.202 --> 36:33.190
Um...

36:34.844 --> 36:37.290
I was way out of line the other night.

36:37.430 --> 36:39.373
There's so much I missed with Lux.

36:39.374 --> 36:41.965
There was so much I wasn't
there for, that I kind of...

36:42.948 --> 36:44.725
I don't know, I overreacted.

36:44.855 --> 36:46.303
Trying to make up for it.

36:46.304 --> 36:47.386
So everything I said to you,

36:47.387 --> 36:49.446
I should have been yelling at myself.

36:54.390 --> 36:58.690
If we're being... completely honest,

37:00.877 --> 37:04.541
I was jealous... okay?

37:07.108 --> 37:09.721
Of, um, me and candy?

37:09.722 --> 37:12.485
No. That was just incredibly annoying.

37:13.212 --> 37:17.859
I'm jealous at how easy
everything seems for you.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.447
I mean, whether it's you

37:19.448 --> 37:22.669
waltzing into a room and
signing a client, or...

37:22.670 --> 37:24.308
Becoming a parent overnight,

37:24.309 --> 37:25.946
and having a relationship with your kid

37:25.947 --> 37:28.900
that I would kill to have with mine.

37:30.222 --> 37:34.525
I don't... I don't know
how to make my kid like me.

37:34.526 --> 37:36.518
And it's a horrible thing to admit,

37:36.519 --> 37:41.599
but I... I don't know how to like my kid.

37:42.751 --> 37:45.509
You know that you are
not alone in this, Emma.

37:46.547 --> 37:50.076
And I know there's some
good in there. In Sam.

37:51.641 --> 37:53.654
Well, seriously, I will give you

37:53.655 --> 37:55.377
all of Candy's

37:55.378 --> 37:57.704
if you could just help me find it.

37:58.333 --> 38:00.080
You know, okay, fine. Half.

38:00.587 --> 38:01.820
Fine, yeah.

38:02.404 --> 38:03.323
Deal.

38:24.261 --> 38:26.802
Sorry I didn't make it the other night.

38:28.365 --> 38:30.163
It's okay, I don't care about that.

38:30.164 --> 38:31.835
I care about the mri.

38:32.520 --> 38:33.814
What did the doctor say?

38:34.122 --> 38:35.524
Oh, uh, nothing... just a bunch

38:35.525 --> 38:37.059
of technical, m

38:37.060 --> 38:38.124
but it's fine.

38:38.440 --> 38:41.526
And I start with the specialist
tutor guy next week, so...

38:41.527 --> 38:42.817
Third one's the charm, right?

38:42.818 --> 38:44.115
Cinderella!

38:46.283 --> 38:49.229
Um... what-what are you doing here?

38:49.230 --> 38:50.598
My mom enrolled me.

38:50.599 --> 38:52.124
Unfortunately.

38:53.339 --> 38:54.514
Oh! Um...

38:54.515 --> 38:57.587
This is Mr. Daniels, one
of our English teachers.

38:57.588 --> 38:58.767
Sam.

38:59.149 --> 39:00.858
I figured I'd see you today.

39:01.823 --> 39:03.608
Found this online this morning.

39:03.609 --> 39:05.225
Local news.

39:08.672 --> 39:09.879
Oh, what's that?

39:10.238 --> 39:14.167
Oh, um... nothing, I... Sam
just moved here from Madison,

39:14.168 --> 39:16.070
and I was telling him that Portland

39:16.071 --> 39:18.582
is much safer, so I guess he was just...

39:18.583 --> 39:20.826
pointing out that you're never
as safe as you think you are.

39:21.380 --> 39:22.192
Yeah.

39:22.536 --> 39:25.093
No. So you're from, uh, Wisconsin?

39:26.409 --> 39:28.231
I was at boarding school there.

39:28.232 --> 39:30.477
Ah. Minnesota.

39:30.478 --> 39:32.215
We're practically neighbors.

39:32.216 --> 39:33.355
Huh.

39:33.356 --> 39:34.804
Minnesota.

39:40.121 --> 39:41.309
I gotta go.

39:41.548 --> 39:43.582
Hey, welcome to Westmonte, Sam.

39:51.996 --> 39:55.637
I think... I'm gonna like it here.
