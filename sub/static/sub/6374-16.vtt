WEBVTT

00:01.900 --> 00:03.500
that would
make her el you have a secret husband?

00:03.500 --> 00:05.800
- i'm sick. 
- what are we talking about here?

00:05.800 --> 00:08.700
$100,000 for
an experimental treatment.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.600
we need to find
a surrogate we can control,

00:10.600 --> 00:14.900
- someone who's desperate for money.
- we're almost done. have a look.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.300
i really like this girl.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.600
- i take these. 
- if you think that's gonna make me

00:18.600 --> 00:21.800
- want to be with you any
less, you're wrong. 
- really?

00:21.800 --> 00:24.100
- will you move in with me?
- i'm so sorry.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.800
- i really thought i was getting better. 
- i'm sorry, too.

00:26.900 --> 00:29.300
charlie, i didn't even know
you were in town.

00:29.300 --> 00:30.400
charlie's not feeling well,

00:30.400 --> 00:32.299
so i'm gonna have
to take her to the doctor.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.100
- hi. 
- i thought you were at the doctor.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.200
i think charlie was just trying
to ruin my night with betty.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.100
i love you.
that's all that matters to me.

00:42.600 --> 00:46.000
* i'll be loving you forever *

00:46.000 --> 00:49.500
everything's so nice
and romantic.

00:50.900 --> 00:51.700
to us, betty.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.400
to us,

00:54.600 --> 00:57.400
and to making the most of
the time we have left together.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.000
yeah.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.099
uh-oh. am i too early?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
i am so sorry.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.500
<i>i swear, i stayed out
as long as i could.</i>

01:11.500 --> 01:13.600
really? 'cause you only left
15 minutes ago.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.800
oh, i had no idea.
i can't wear a watch

01:15.800 --> 01:19.200
because my arms are so bloated
from carrying your child, so...

01:20.300 --> 01:21.400
oh, whoa.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.200
what? are you okay?

01:22.200 --> 01:25.100
oh, whoa, whoa.
um, so-so.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.100
i just think my blood sugar
might be low.

01:27.100 --> 01:29.100
- what do you need?
- some food.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.400
- uh...
- oh, this will work.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.600
what? uh...
mmm.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.300
mmm. mmm.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.200
she's a monster.

01:39.600 --> 01:44.000
<i>i mean, we're at the movies,
she calls ten times.</i>

01:44.100 --> 01:45.200
we're at dinner,

01:45.400 --> 01:48.200
emergency text-
"i need flaxseed right away."

01:48.700 --> 01:50.900
pregnant women
are difficult.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.200
oh, please.
we're bitches.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.600
plus she also
has it in for you,

01:54.600 --> 01:55.800
'cause you did
steal her man.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.700
wait.
she cheated on henry.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.200
<i>she didn't love him.
i love him,</i>

01:59.200 --> 02:01.100
and i've got three weeks
left with him,

02:01.200 --> 02:04.400
and she is making it impossible
for us to spend time together.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.800
well, what about lunchtime?
oh, i know.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.800
you could rent one of these
"by the hour" hotel rooms.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
free movies.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.000
that's a good idea.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
ooh.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.200
not the smutty hotel room,
the lunch hour...

02:16.200 --> 02:18.700
and i think charlie is busy
in her prenatal yoga class.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.300
mm. that reminds me.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.500
i've got the baby doctor
this afternoon.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.400
it's the end
of the first trimester.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.700
i just hope the doctor's
not gonna say

02:25.700 --> 02:28.600
it's okay to go runnin'
or swimmin' or something.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.000
hello?
are you listening to me?

02:32.500 --> 02:36.300
yep-baby doctor,
trimester, hate exercising...

02:36.900 --> 02:38.600
i have
lunch plans with henry.

02:42.700 --> 02:43.600
where is she?

02:43.600 --> 02:45.500
eating with betty.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.400
oh, great.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.000
we need the baby
to be healthy, not flabby.

02:49.000 --> 02:49.400
don't worry.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.800
we'll put it on a juice fast
the minute it pops out.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.800
oh. listen, everything's gonna
check out okay with the doctor,

02:57.800 --> 03:00.900
and then monday,
all hell will break loose

03:00.900 --> 03:02.900
as the exiled queens
of "mode"...

03:02.900 --> 03:05.900
- make their triumphant return. 
- how are we doing on the press coverage?

03:06.000 --> 03:06.900
i've pitched it

03:06.900 --> 03:08.900
as a major
fashion world announcement,

03:08.900 --> 03:11.200
so all the women-friendly
networks are in a lather.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.900
"the view" is doing
a special live broadcast,

03:13.900 --> 03:14.800
which they
never could've done

03:14.800 --> 03:16.600
if potty-mouthed rosie
was still around.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.700
good.
i want this moment.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.300
i need this moment.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.000
- all eyes on me...
- me.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.000
<i>you.</i>

03:31.000 --> 03:33.600
as i march up the steps
of the meade building.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.400
it'll be
the greatest comeback since...

03:37.100 --> 03:38.300
jesus.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.300
blasphemous...

03:41.200 --> 03:42.200
and sexy.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.000
hey, what's goin' on?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.500
uh, thought we had
a meeting with a photographer.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.400
we did. amelie bissou,
she canceled.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.000
photographers...
they are so flaky, huh?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.300
yeah,
this flaky photographer

03:58.300 --> 03:59.600
won't come out
of her bathroom

03:59.600 --> 04:02.700
because someone...
who works at this magazine

04:02.700 --> 04:04.400
slept with her
and never called.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.700
what a jerk, huh?

04:08.700 --> 04:11.400
oh, no. sh-she never gave me
her number.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.600
ever since renee, you have
been on a downward spiral-

04:13.700 --> 04:16.899
- out every night, missing meetings... 
- we think you may need some 
professional help.

04:16.899 --> 04:20.600
you mean like a shrink?
no way. no. i'm fine.

04:20.700 --> 04:23.300
the woman you fell in love with
almost killed your assistant

04:23.300 --> 04:24.800
and burned
your apartment down.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.500
you are not fine.
you need to talk to someone.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.100
another voice could help.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.300
entonces...

04:37.400 --> 04:39.600
<i>papi, i love you,
but your handwriting stinks.</i>

04:39.600 --> 04:40.900
what does this say?

04:40.900 --> 04:43.200
well, there was a message
on the machine from coach diaz.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.300
<i>he wants to talk
to you about justin...</i>

04:45.800 --> 04:49.400
and this is perfect penmanship.
you need your eyes checked.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.200
justin!
what does coach diaz want?

04:52.600 --> 04:55.000
remember when i told you
that coach diaz is a total jerk

04:55.100 --> 04:57.600
- and the meanest gym teacher
i've ever had? 
- yeah, you told me.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.600
- you told everybody.
- now he's gonna fail me in gym.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.900
- what about all those notes i wrote
excusing you from class? 
- he doesn't care.

05:03.900 --> 05:07.000
he said that every student has
to fulfill a "p.e. requirement."

05:07.100 --> 05:10.500
<i>well, every student should...
but not you.</i>

05:10.800 --> 05:12.000
you're special.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.800
coach diaz does not get me.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.400
well, don't you worry.
he is gonna get you,

05:15.400 --> 05:19.500
because my taxes pay his salary,
which means i'm his boss. 'kay.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.000
hilda, i don't think
you paid any taxes last year.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.900
so amelie bissou
is out of the bathroom,

05:28.900 --> 05:30.800
and the photo shoot
is back on.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.600
- that's great. 
- it only took an
hour on the phone with her agent,

05:33.600 --> 05:34.500
tripling her fee,

05:34.500 --> 05:37.700
<i>and you are not allowed
anywhere near the photo studio</i>

05:37.700 --> 05:39.800
- on the day.
- betty, you're the best.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.700
daniel, i know
that part of my job

05:42.700 --> 05:44.900
is following you around
and cleaning up your messes,

05:45.700 --> 05:46.900
but ever since renee,

05:47.300 --> 05:49.600
there just isn't
a pooper-scooper big enough.

05:49.700 --> 05:53.500
- you've been talking to my mom and sister?
- as your unofficial, occasional thepist,

05:53.500 --> 05:54.500
i think that it would be

05:54.500 --> 05:56.700
a really good idea
for you to see somebody.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.400
i am not gonna go see
a therapist.

05:58.400 --> 06:03.400
- i am doing fine on my own, betty.
- according to reliable internet sources,

06:03.400 --> 06:05.300
the definition
of an insane person-

06:05.500 --> 06:08.000
"one who or that which
performs the same actions

06:08.000 --> 06:10.800
over and over again
expecting different results."

06:10.900 --> 06:13.000
insanity or optimism.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.400
if you want things
in your life to be different,

06:15.500 --> 06:17.100
you must do things differently.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.300
therefore, if your instincts
are telling you

06:19.300 --> 06:23.700
<i>not to go to therapy,
then go to therapy.</i>

06:26.300 --> 06:28.600
your appointment's at 2:00
with dr. wallace.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.400
i didn't say yes.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.300
henry, you ready
for our lunch date?

06:35.300 --> 06:38.400
um, i would be,
but charlie called,

06:39.300 --> 06:41.000
and her
yoga partner canceled.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
so i have to-

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
betty?

06:46.600 --> 06:49.400
- you do realize she's doing
this on purpose, don't you? 
- yes.

06:49.400 --> 06:54.100
<i>- she's trying to get in between us because 
she hates me. 
- no. no, no, no. she doesn't hate you.</i>

06:54.200 --> 06:55.800
look, betty, i'm sorry.

06:55.900 --> 06:59.600
- i guess i hoped that you guys
could be friends. 
- friends? friends?

06:59.600 --> 07:01.000
how can i be friends
with her

07:01.000 --> 07:04.100
when she is always trying
to get in between us,

07:04.400 --> 07:07.100
- over and over and over again?
- i know.

07:07.100 --> 07:08.500
she will never stop...

07:11.100 --> 07:13.200
 -unless...
- unless what?

07:13.300 --> 07:14.900
unless
i do things differently.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.400
hi.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.200
where's henry?

07:23.300 --> 07:24.400
he can't make it,

07:24.500 --> 07:27.200
so i'm here
to be your yoga partner

07:27.200 --> 07:29.100
and your friend.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.000
betty, no.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.600
we can't be
yoga partners or friends.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.800
charlie, don't you remember
when we first met?

07:48.300 --> 07:50.100
i bought you a brownie.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.200
charlie, we could go back to
those times, the brownie times.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.500
look, brownie!

07:54.500 --> 07:55.800
well, i've got
gestational diabetes,

07:55.800 --> 07:58.000
so i could die if i ate that,
okay? but thank you.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.600
welcome to baby bump yoga.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.500
let's start
with downward dog.

08:03.700 --> 08:07.000
so you're
having a natural childbirth.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.700
- is that like a pool or a bathtub or
- go away. now.

08:09.700 --> 08:10.800
shh!

08:13.400 --> 08:14.600
good job, guys.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.700
excuse me.
are you coach diaz?

08:19.400 --> 08:20.900
yeah. can i help you?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.300
you're the gym teacher?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.200
yes, and you are?

08:27.000 --> 08:30.700
- i am justin suarez' mother.
- i guess you heard he's failing.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.500
i did hear, and i think
there's been a big mistake,

08:33.500 --> 08:34.900
because i have been
sending notes

08:34.900 --> 08:37.900
asking that justin be excused
from p.e., so...

08:37.900 --> 08:39.000
you know, tell me,
when you were in school,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.200
did you get excused
from math class with a note

08:41.200 --> 08:45.000
- or english class? 
- not officially because i would skip those,

08:45.200 --> 08:48.100
but this is not math...
or english.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.100
well, i believe
fitness and exercise

08:50.100 --> 08:54.400
- are just as important. 
- yes, but my justin is not really an athlete.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.400
well, luckily you don't have
to be an athlete

08:56.400 --> 08:57.600
to be in my class.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.200
he just needs to show up,
make an effort.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.000
okay, let's just...
get right to it.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.800
if you fail justin,

09:05.100 --> 09:06.600
i'm gonna talk
to the principal.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.300
great. you should
swing by his office,

09:08.300 --> 09:11.900
- schedule an appointment.
- hey, i am not joking here.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.200
oh, neither am i.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.300
ms. suarez, i have a master's
in wellness training.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.500
i just happen to believe

09:16.500 --> 09:19.700
that everyone can benefit
from a gym class, even you.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.500
whoa. what is that
supposed to mean?

09:24.200 --> 09:25.800
do not turn your back on me.

09:25.900 --> 09:29.600
this is not over.
i pay your salary, coach diaz!

09:35.000 --> 09:35.600
you know what?

09:35.600 --> 09:38.500
i read that babies
born in water

09:39.000 --> 09:40.700
have higher i.q.s
than the babies-

09:40.700 --> 09:42.700
oh, my god. please stop.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.300
- okay, partners. grab your mommy's waist. 
- don't touch me. don't touch me.

09:46.300 --> 09:47.600
don't touch me.
don't touch me. don't touch me.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.600
- betty, don't touch me!
- but that's what she told me-

09:49.600 --> 09:52.900
okay, you two
with the bad energy-out!

09:54.000 --> 09:55.100
you're still touching me.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.800
i'm sorry.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.400
i know that your situation
at the moment is not ideal.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.600
oh. oh,
it is far from ideal.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.300
this weekend i was supposed
to be at home in tucson

10:08.300 --> 10:10.300
having a baby shower
with my friends,

10:10.300 --> 10:12.800
- so unless you want to-
- throw you a baby shower?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
- what? - wasn't that what
you were just about to say?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.700
- unless i want to throw you a baby shower?
- do you want to throw me a baby shower?

10:18.700 --> 10:22.300
- um, yes.
- when?

10:23.300 --> 10:24.900
tomorrow.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.600
wow. you're not at all
what i expected.

10:30.700 --> 10:31.900
when i heard
the name "dr. wallace,"

10:31.900 --> 10:34.000
i thought
it would be a guy.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.900
but then i thought,
no, don't be closed-minded.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.300
it could be
an old lady, too.

10:39.600 --> 10:43.300
- so what exactly are you hoping
to get out of therapy? 
- a date?

10:43.600 --> 10:44.800
have you been depressed?

10:45.500 --> 10:47.500
nothing a drink with you
wouldn't cure.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.200
- get out.
- wha-seriously?

10:50.200 --> 10:52.500
i'm not in the business
of wasting my time with patients

10:52.500 --> 10:54.400
who aren't prepared
to take therapy seriously.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.500
when you're ready
to face up to your emotions

10:56.500 --> 10:58.800
and talk about them
like an adult, you can return.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.500
until then, good-bye.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
so?

11:11.200 --> 11:13.600
everything's fine. the fetus
is healthy and growing,

11:13.600 --> 11:16.700
- and you'll be giving birth in six months. 
- so i can go back to work?

11:16.900 --> 11:19.100
absolutely. you can work.
you can exercise-

11:19.100 --> 11:20.700
let's just stick
with the work.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.700
so is it safe to start
telling people we're pregnant?

11:23.700 --> 11:26.800
sure. tell whoever you want-
friends, family...

11:26.800 --> 11:30.300
- 400 members of the news media. 
- thank you, dr. weiss.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.900
christina, put your muumuu on.
we'll meet you in the lobby.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.800
- oh, do you want a video of
the sonogram? 
- uh, don't care.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.300
marc,
call barbara at p.m.k.-

11:37.300 --> 11:39.900
- pretty barbara, not
freckly barbara. 
- on it.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.500
quite a driven woman,
isn't she?

11:42.500 --> 11:43.600
she's a bitch.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.400
that, too.

11:46.500 --> 11:50.800
oh. why does that say
"meade/slater baby"?

11:51.500 --> 11:53.200
don't worry.
that's just for your file.

11:53.900 --> 11:54.800
i'm sure
it must be strange

11:54.800 --> 11:56.500
carrying the child
of a dead man.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.400
betty.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.400
- oh, henry.
- hey.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.400
guess what?

12:02.500 --> 12:04.400
for her shower, charlie wants
her favorite tamales

12:04.400 --> 12:07.300
- from this place in tucson, and i
tracked them down. 
- wait, her shower?

12:07.300 --> 12:09.200
oh, yeah, i'm throwing
charlie a baby shower,

12:09.200 --> 12:10.400
so that she'll see me
as a friend

12:10.400 --> 12:12.200
and let you and i
spend more time together.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.700
- you would do that?
- i am doing it.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.100
- so get this-so escobar's-
do you know the place? 
- yeah.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.000
well, they won't ship
their tamales overnight-

12:18.000 --> 12:21.900
- ruins the flavor-so i have to buy 
them a seat on a plane. 
- it sounds like that's a lot of work.

12:21.900 --> 12:25.600
it is, but i don't mind.
it's for us,

12:26.000 --> 12:27.600
and when you want
something bad enough,

12:27.600 --> 12:28.500
you work harder.

12:29.900 --> 12:30.600
oh.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.500
oh, thank you
for calling me back.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.000
it's escobar's. i have
to take this. oh, yeah.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.100
so, um,
my first question is,

12:37.600 --> 12:39.000
can the tamales fly coach?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.400
look,
i'm sorry about before.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.400
it's just, i...
i like to flirt.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.600
and what do you get
out of flirting?

12:49.900 --> 12:51.100
i don't know.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.200
- is it approval?
- yeah, i guess.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.900
feels good to be wanted?

12:57.400 --> 12:58.800
guess i need that right now.

12:59.700 --> 13:00.600
why?

13:02.300 --> 13:03.500
there was this woman...

13:04.100 --> 13:07.100
i just wanted so badly
for things to be different,

13:07.400 --> 13:12.100
for meo...
find something... deeper.

13:13.100 --> 13:14.900
instead i ended up
with nothing.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.500
i think this is something
we should explore.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.400
what is keeping her?

13:23.600 --> 13:26.100
i'm due at sergio rossi
to pick out new work shoes.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.100
oh, these scottish types-
no concern for time.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.200
if tilda swinton says 7:30,

13:30.200 --> 13:33.200
<i>- do not expect her before 10:00. 
- christina.</i>

13:34.000 --> 13:37.200
<i>johan, pleascome to
the outpatient surgical center.</i>

13:37.200 --> 13:38.800
where is she?

13:38.800 --> 13:41.500
maybe the bathroom?
ugh. these scottish types.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.000
if tilda swinton
says she has to pee-

13:43.000 --> 13:47.200
no. she knows
it's bradford's baby.

13:49.300 --> 13:50.400
she's gone.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.900
they're arriving
at laguardia on flight 47?

13:56.100 --> 13:58.400
perfect. a messenger
will be waiting. thank you.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.200
is it crazy that i'm flying
in tamales from tucson

14:03.200 --> 14:05.300
<i>because that's what charlie
wants to eat at her baby shower?</i>

14:05.300 --> 14:07.600
- okay, stop begging. i'll come. 
- what?

14:07.600 --> 14:10.200
- huh? i didn't say anything. 
- you just said you'd come to the shower.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.200
- why would i say i'd come to the shower? 
- i don't know, amanda.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.500
do you want
to come to the shower?

14:14.500 --> 14:16.200
do i want to come
to the shower

14:16.200 --> 14:17.600
for someone
i don't even know?

14:17.700 --> 14:20.400
why would i do that?
what are you serving?

14:21.100 --> 14:24.200
well, tamales, a bunch
of fun little appetizers,

14:24.200 --> 14:26.100
and my dad
is making empanadas.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.600
okay, well, that's crazy.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.900
don't cancel the shower
just because i'm not coming.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.300
let me see
what i can do.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.900
he gave you detention?

14:35.900 --> 14:37.200
<i>gym detention.</i>

14:37.200 --> 14:38.900
what is "gym detention"?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.500
it got invented today
for me.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.400
i had to organize
the equipment room.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.900
there were balls and bats.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.900
it was like a nightmare
that would never end.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
- this is all your fault. 
- well, i was just trying to help you out.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.400
you came to my school
and yelled at my teacher.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.100
- what did you think would happen?
- okay, look. i can fix this.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.200
please don't.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.200
he might make me quarterback
of the hockey team or something.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.600
hey. what if i change
my approach?

15:02.800 --> 15:04.500
oh, my god, mom. no.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.300
this is all getting
very "sweeney todd" now.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.000
so, christina,

15:11.200 --> 15:13.900
i would love
to sit and chat

15:13.900 --> 15:16.700
and clear up
this whole misunderstanding.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.000
call me.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.600
i'm worried sick about you.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.200
even i didn't believe that.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.200
well, you are
your toughest critic.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.600
what a screwup.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.200
remind me to get that
stupid doctor's license revoked.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.200
done. by the time
we're through with him,

15:33.200 --> 15:35.100
he'll be neutering dogs
in buffalo.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.100
this is bad, marc.

15:37.700 --> 15:38.600
if she disappears,

15:38.600 --> 15:41.100
if that baby disappears,
we've got nothing.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.500
no baby means
no return to "mode,"

15:43.500 --> 15:46.700
means no future
for either of us.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.900
oh, willie, why can't things
just be easy for once?

15:50.700 --> 15:53.400
on the surface,
our plans are rock solid,

15:53.800 --> 15:55.100
and we're both so attractive.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.400
perhaps that's our curse,
marc-

15:58.100 --> 16:00.400
that and our humanity.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.900
i was
so stupid to trust her!

16:05.900 --> 16:07.900
there's no way
you could've known.

16:07.900 --> 16:12.100
stuart, this is the worst thing
that could happen.

16:13.000 --> 16:13.900
oh.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.300
or is it the best thing?

16:16.800 --> 16:17.900
no, i'm serious.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.200
we know that she was willing to
pay all that money for this...

16:21.900 --> 16:23.400
- yeah.
- enough for my operation.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.100
so?

16:24.100 --> 16:26.200
so maybe she'll pay more.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.300
you're thinking she's got you.
i say you've got her.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.300
- when that thing inside you
- stuart that "thing" is going to be a baby.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.400
well, she needs it,

16:35.900 --> 16:37.700
and when
people need something,

16:38.600 --> 16:39.800
that makes them weak.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.800
yeah.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.100
okay, what just happened?

16:55.100 --> 16:56.500
i looked over at you,

16:56.600 --> 16:59.300
- and there was a silence, and 
the next thing i know
- you kissed me.

16:59.300 --> 17:03.300
- no, no, no, you kissed me. 
doctor, you lunged at me
- because you seduced me.

17:03.300 --> 17:06.099
- i didn't do anything.
- oh, you can't help it.

17:06.300 --> 17:10.000
- you're a seducer. that's what you do.
- but it's not working for me anymore.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.400
who are you calling?

17:11.500 --> 17:12.400
my shrink.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.700
but i-look, i'm so sorry.

17:13.700 --> 17:18.000
- i- i promise, i'll pay you for this. 
- and now i feel like a whore. super.

17:18.099 --> 17:22.800
- derrick, i need to see you right away. 
i'm coming over now. 
- i'm the one who needs help.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.500
- you showed me this. what am i
supposed to do now? 
- i don't know.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.200
you're not my problem anymore.
you're an animal.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.400
leave, please.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.200
go out, find women
and ruin their lives.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.400
uh, listen, ms. suarez,

17:36.400 --> 17:38.600
it's very nice of you
to offer to cut my hair,

17:38.600 --> 17:40.500
but i'm happy
just to talk about justin.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.700
it's-it's my job.

17:41.700 --> 17:44.600
oh, please, it's nothing.
it's nothing. here.

17:44.600 --> 17:49.100
it's just my way of saying
we got off on the wrong foot.

17:50.900 --> 17:51.800
you know,
and i-i didn't mean anything

17:51.800 --> 17:53.100
about you needing
a gym class.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.300
you got a great body.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.800
not that i was looking
at your body.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.600
oh, yeah, right. right.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.000
i mean, you're the parent,
i'm the teacher.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.800
i mean, i'm the parent.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.000
oh, gosh, sorry. i just-
i get a little bit worked up

18:07.000 --> 18:10.400
- over justin sometimes. 
- hey, don't worry about it. 
it's your kid. i get it.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.000
look, if it makes
you feel any better,

18:12.100 --> 18:13.800
i swear to you
that i would never do anything

18:13.800 --> 18:15.100
to embarrass him.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.700
thank you. that does
make me feel better.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.300
mm.

18:26.000 --> 18:26.800
you were gonna-

18:26.900 --> 18:27.800
oh, yeah.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.900
okay.
this is a great place.

18:31.900 --> 18:34.900
- oh, thank you. yeah, we just o
- oh!

18:35.200 --> 18:35.700
aah!

18:35.700 --> 18:39.800
- <i>oh, my god! let me see.
- no! uh, no. tha-i-it's okay.</i>

18:39.900 --> 18:42.200
- let me get some alcohol.
- oh, wow.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.700
- here.
- that's nail polish remover.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.800
- yeah, but it-it-it sanitizes. 
- it's okay. don't worry about it. 
i'm fine, okay?

18:47.800 --> 18:50.000
- i'm just gonna go bleed at home. 
- oh.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.600
oh, man.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.500
oh. ugh. hilda.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.500
um, no. no, i'm looking
at the plates right now.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.700
they are definitely not
what i ordered.

19:06.700 --> 19:09.200
these have father time
on them-

19:09.400 --> 19:11.800
father time, not a baby.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.100
he has a beard.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.000
look, i'm sorry
i'm being such a pain.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.800
i am generally
a much nicer person.

19:17.800 --> 19:18.800
i just-

19:22.600 --> 19:23.500
my fault.

19:23.700 --> 19:24.500
i know.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.500
i'm sorry, mrs. meade.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.400
oh, betty, it's fine.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.500
it's a purse, not a baby.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.600
once in nantucket,

19:33.600 --> 19:35.800
i dropped daniel
in a bucket of ice,

19:36.300 --> 19:37.300
landed on his head.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.000
okay.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.900
uh, well,
he should be fine now.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.900
i got him
to see the therapist.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.800
- i heard. thank you for that.
- oh, don't worry about it.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.400
just another one
of the many things

19:48.400 --> 19:49.500
i had to do today.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.400
- betty, when are you
going to stop? 
- i can't.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.800
i agreed to throw
this last-minute baby shower

19:54.800 --> 19:59.500
- for charlie, henry's pregnant ex-girlfriend. 
- oh, right. that ordeal.

20:02.362 --> 20:04.113
something i have to do
to spend time with henry.

20:04.113 --> 20:07.862
i mean, he's leaving
in three weeks and-aah. ow!

20:08.812 --> 20:10.222
why did you do that?

20:10.222 --> 20:13.599
to get your attention.
wake up, betty.

20:13.666 --> 20:16.133
this relationship you are in
has no future,

20:16.199 --> 20:18.067
and the sooner
you realize that,

20:18.133 --> 20:20.466
<i>the sooner you'll get back
to living your life,</i>

20:20.533 --> 20:23.050
instead of planning
babyhowers

20:23.050 --> 20:25.866
for your boyfriend's
ex-girlfriends.

20:32.738 --> 20:35.533
henry, it's over.

20:35.599 --> 20:37.866
ugh. it just
doesn't sound right.

20:37.933 --> 20:41.112
i mean, this is henry.
i don't want it to be over.

20:41.112 --> 20:43.300
this jacket makes me
look like a nerd.

20:43.300 --> 20:46.253
why do you need to apologize
to this guy in person?

20:46.253 --> 20:49.237
i can't just call
coach diaz.

20:49.237 --> 20:51.706
i nearly maimed him
for life.

20:51.706 --> 20:54.613
and justin needs
to pass gym, so...

20:55.300 --> 20:57.862
now i look
like a slutty nerd.

20:57.862 --> 21:00.487
<i>i don't think this
has anything to do with justin.</i>

21:00.487 --> 21:02.690
what are you talking about?
oh, come on, hilda.

21:02.690 --> 21:05.050
<i>first, you pick
a fight with this guy.</i>

21:05.050 --> 21:07.738
then you invited him over
for a haircut?

21:07.738 --> 21:08.925
you know what this is?

21:08.925 --> 21:12.660
<i>this is hector reale
from ninth grade all over again.</i>

21:12.660 --> 21:13.691
that is ridiculous.

21:13.691 --> 21:17.925
i did not give hector reale a
haircut. i know what you gave him.

21:18.612 --> 21:19.441
come on, hilda.

21:19.441 --> 21:22.159
you totally like
this coach guy.

21:22.453 --> 21:24.862
what's his name?
coach diaz.

21:24.862 --> 21:26.268
what's his first name?

21:27.640 --> 21:28.738
coach?

21:28.738 --> 21:29.503
well,
you should fix that,

21:29.503 --> 21:30.362
'cause it's gonna sound
really weird

21:30.362 --> 21:31.284
when you guys are kissing

21:31.284 --> 21:34.425
and you're all like,
"ooh, coach. ooh."

21:34.691 --> 21:36.863
shut up! stop talking
about it. "oh, coach."

21:36.863 --> 21:37.690
there's not gonna be
any kissing.

21:37.690 --> 21:40.800
<i>ay, you're getting me
all freaked out. hilda.</i>

21:41.565 --> 21:44.331
i don't know, betty.
i just-

21:44.331 --> 21:46.487
i felt something
when i was talking to him,

21:46.487 --> 21:50.316
and it was just
the first time since santos.

21:51.250 --> 21:53.425
you have a crush...

21:53.863 --> 21:54.268
mm.

21:54.344 --> 21:57.613
and i have henry.

21:58.063 --> 21:59.612
check us out.

22:02.987 --> 22:04.300
who is that?
i don't know.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.925
it's-it's not time.
we're not ready.

22:10.706 --> 22:11.925
we need to talk.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.565
all we've been doing lately
is obsessing

22:15.565 --> 22:17.738
about how little time
we have ft together.

22:18.687 --> 22:21.238
i know, and it's horrible,

22:21.238 --> 22:23.339
and it so stressful
for the both of us,

22:23.405 --> 22:24.206
and i-i don't-i-

22:24.206 --> 22:25.999
that's why i'm here.

22:26.815 --> 22:29.785
i think there's only
one thing to do. oh, god.

22:30.339 --> 22:33.138
we have to
stay together forever.

22:33.205 --> 22:36.105
oh! that's not what
i thought you were gonna say,

22:36.172 --> 22:38.105
but i like it! go on.

22:38.172 --> 22:40.439
my cousin lance just got
a new job at transwest airlines.

22:40.505 --> 22:42.378
he says i can use
his friends and family discount.

22:42.378 --> 22:44.175
i have to do his taxes
for 20 years,

22:44.175 --> 22:46.238
but i can see you every
other weekend. really?

22:46.238 --> 22:49.675
and-and once in a while, you can come out
and see me. or we could meet in the middle.

22:49.675 --> 22:52.812
yes. yes.
god, i love you.

22:52.862 --> 22:56.031
the middle just happens
to be springfield, missouri,

22:56.081 --> 22:58.753
a.k.a.
queen city of the ozarks,

22:58.753 --> 23:00.425
renowned throughout america
for having

23:00.425 --> 23:02.300
the most varied weather in
the natn. i love weather.

23:02.300 --> 23:03.644
i know you do.

23:03.644 --> 23:04.425
and in the meantime,

23:04.425 --> 23:07.315
we can call or-or e-mail
or video chat.

23:07.315 --> 23:09.800
it-it's the 21st century.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.238
we can see each other
every day if we want to.

23:12.238 --> 23:16.050
wow. you really thought
about this.

23:17.156 --> 23:18.999
you're the most important thing
in my life.

23:30.313 --> 23:33.175
oh, god. is 11:00.
charlie-her baby shower.

23:33.175 --> 23:35.144
oh. i guess it's too late
to call it off.

23:35.144 --> 23:38.269
are you kidding?
now it's even more important.

23:38.269 --> 23:40.707
charlie will be
part of my life forever.

23:42.656 --> 23:45.675
charlie,
welcome to your baby shower.

23:45.765 --> 23:46.488
henry.

23:46.488 --> 23:48.940
i was just leaving.
you ladies have fun.

23:49.875 --> 23:50.737
bye.

23:54.344 --> 23:56.581
i'm late because
your directions were messed up.

23:57.000 --> 23:57.660
oh.

23:57.660 --> 24:00.738
wow. i don't remember
your house being so small.

24:00.738 --> 24:02.847
something smells
really funny.

24:04.438 --> 24:05.925
come on in.

24:11.266 --> 24:12.878
stuart.

24:17.203 --> 24:19.050
hello, christina.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.487
how did you find me?

24:21.487 --> 24:24.644
i called her. it was the
right thing, christina.

24:24.644 --> 24:26.362
you don't have
a lot of options.

24:26.362 --> 24:28.737
nyet options.

24:28.737 --> 24:31.204
but what stuart was
savvy enough to recognize

24:31.254 --> 24:33.582
is you do have power.

24:33.582 --> 24:37.534
i need this baby, christina,

24:37.534 --> 24:41.503
and i will pay to ensure
you follow through with this.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.362
what do you want?

24:44.425 --> 24:45.500
nothing.

24:45.550 --> 24:46.675
christina-

24:46.675 --> 24:47.941
no. don't.

24:54.800 --> 24:55.972
she'll be back.

24:57.110 --> 24:59.129
she has nowhere else to go.

25:02.079 --> 25:03.269
thank you.

25:07.128 --> 25:08.112
thanks.

25:12.488 --> 25:14.750
welcome... amanda.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.612
calm down. i can only stay
for, like, five minutes.

25:17.612 --> 25:19.999
i have a million things
to do today.

25:21.406 --> 25:22.612
what's that?

25:22.806 --> 25:25.362
uh, shrimp empanadas
in mole sauce.

25:25.362 --> 25:26.456
my dad made 'em
this morning.

25:26.456 --> 25:27.612
mm.

25:28.863 --> 25:31.675
it's pretty good.
wish i didn't have to leave.

25:32.328 --> 25:32.800
is there more?

25:32.800 --> 25:34.800
betty? hey, betty?

25:34.800 --> 25:35.362
yes?

25:37.315 --> 25:39.363
what is that?

25:39.422 --> 25:42.300
<i>oh, uh,
that is a pi袮ta.</i>

25:42.300 --> 25:45.440
i thought it would be really fun. well,
the plastic lining chokes the birds

25:45.440 --> 25:47.941
that feed at the landfills.
oh, uh-

25:47.941 --> 25:48.566
and i'm sorry,

25:48.566 --> 25:49.988
but are these vegetables
fresh cut?

25:49.988 --> 25:52.221
because they sure
don't look like it.

25:52.750 --> 25:55.125
um, well,
i could cut some now.

25:55.175 --> 25:56.050
that'd be great.

26:00.925 --> 26:02.394
why is everyone
so fat at this party?

26:04.925 --> 26:08.500
betty, you don't seem
like you're having much fun.

26:08.550 --> 26:11.769
yeah, well,
i just gotta let that go,

26:11.769 --> 26:15.347
because i'm the one who decided
to throw charlie this party.

26:15.347 --> 26:16.425
besides, henry and i
have found a way

26:16.425 --> 26:18.425
to make it work
long-distance.

26:18.425 --> 26:20.753
long-distance?

26:21.050 --> 26:22.363
dad, i know that voice.

26:22.363 --> 26:24.999
the skeptical,
i- know-better-than-you voice

26:24.999 --> 26:27.250
that you trot out every time
you think i'm making a mistake,

26:27.300 --> 26:29.563
and hilda used to get it
more often.

26:29.613 --> 26:31.613
look, i'm sure
you have a great plan.

26:31.613 --> 26:34.675
all i'm saying is that
long-distance is no replacement

26:34.675 --> 26:36.488
for spending time together.

26:36.488 --> 26:38.956
henry will be back and forth
all the time.

26:41.250 --> 26:44.143
he said i was the most
important thing in his life.

26:45.187 --> 26:50.784
<i>amor, the thing is,
he's having a baby,</i>

26:50.784 --> 26:52.237
and once you're a parent,

26:52.237 --> 26:54.656
nothing's ever the same.

26:54.706 --> 26:57.175
it'll be hard work,
but we can do it.

26:59.562 --> 27:01.812
daniel.
can i borrow some money?

27:01.862 --> 27:02.987
what are you doing here?

27:02.987 --> 27:06.312
uh, therapy, uh,
didn't exactly work out.

27:06.362 --> 27:10.112
uh, y-yeah. i can see that.
what happened?

27:10.112 --> 27:12.613
i slept with her.
then i went out.

27:12.613 --> 27:14.437
i met this girl at a club,

27:14.487 --> 27:17.062
went back to her apartment,
where i met her roommate,

27:17.112 --> 27:18.675
who took me out
to another club,

27:18.675 --> 27:20.550
where i met
these russian ballerinas.

27:20.550 --> 27:22.237
they turned out
to be strippers,

27:22.237 --> 27:24.613
and i woke up
somewhere in queens,

27:24.613 --> 27:26.800
um, and i lost my wallet.
betty.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.738
christina. um, i really
need to talk to you.

27:29.738 --> 27:31.863
um-
is there soy milk?

27:31.863 --> 27:35.878
and why do these plates have an
old man on them? ugh. uh, um, okay.

27:35.878 --> 27:37.999
uh, daniel,
borrow cab fare from my dad.

27:37.999 --> 27:39.999
dad, go to the market.
get soy milk.

27:39.999 --> 27:42.487
christina, upstairs now.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.738
sounds like you had,
uh, quite a night.

27:48.047 --> 27:48.800
yeah.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.188
wanna take a walk?
sure.

27:52.472 --> 27:54.160
good. come on.

27:56.203 --> 27:58.125
and i-i don't know
what to do.

27:58.175 --> 27:59.999
betty, she's done this
to me before,

27:59.999 --> 28:01.957
and i can't believe
i've been so stupid.

28:01.957 --> 28:05.425
okay, first of all,
stop blaming yourself.

28:05.425 --> 28:06.753
ohh.
this is wilhelmina.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.703
this is what she does.
she uses people.

28:08.753 --> 28:11.269
i know, i know,
and that i can cope with.

28:11.269 --> 28:15.675
but this time, it's not just me.
there's gonna be a baby.

28:15.675 --> 28:18.613
christina, there is a difference
between you and her.

28:18.613 --> 28:19.925
oh, is there?

28:19.925 --> 28:23.316
<i>yes,
you are a good person.</i>

28:23.316 --> 28:24.988
really?

28:26.125 --> 28:27.112
really.

28:27.112 --> 28:30.550
betty!
are there tamales or not?

28:30.550 --> 28:31.999
ugh.

28:32.562 --> 28:34.719
i'll be right there!

28:35.063 --> 28:36.487
she is annoying.

28:40.688 --> 28:41.500
you know what they say

28:41.550 --> 28:44.562
about pregnant women
being so beautiful?

28:44.612 --> 28:46.237
well, i have a question.

28:46.237 --> 28:48.175
what if u're already
really beautiful?

28:48.175 --> 28:50.800
is it possible
to become too beautiful?

28:50.800 --> 28:52.800
i mean, is it dangerous?
could you hurt someone?

28:52.800 --> 28:56.160
ladies, straight
from tucson, arizona-

28:56.160 --> 28:58.050
especially for charlie-

28:58.050 --> 29:01.988
escobar's famous
green corn tamales!

29:01.988 --> 29:02.862
ooh!

29:02.999 --> 29:04.471
no. charlie?

29:07.739 --> 29:09.272
here. take that.

29:13.187 --> 29:14.487
this isn't the right tamale.

29:14.487 --> 29:17.050
yes, it is.
i think i would know, betty.

29:17.050 --> 29:19.441
those are from escobar's.
they wouldn't even ship them,

29:19.441 --> 29:22.363
so i had to have them flown out.
then they got ruined on the plane.

29:22.363 --> 29:25.175
they flew first-class.
well, they're soggy.

29:25.175 --> 29:26.331
you know what, charlie?

29:26.331 --> 29:29.969
i have broken my back to try
and make this shower happen.

29:29.999 --> 29:31.894
yeah, well, maybe that's
the way you want it to look.

29:31.894 --> 29:34.300
<i>no, that is the way it is.</i>

29:34.300 --> 29:35.894
this isn't
what i wanted, betty.

29:35.894 --> 29:37.988
well, i'm sorry that this isn't
good enough for you, charlie,

29:37.988 --> 29:39.628
but i have worked
really hard,

29:39.628 --> 29:42.250
and now i feel stupid for even
trying to be nice to you

29:42.300 --> 29:43.750
<i>when you have been
such a jerk.</i>

29:43.800 --> 29:44.863
and i don't know why

29:44.863 --> 29:47.175
i'm letting your crabby
littlettitude get to me,

29:47.175 --> 29:49.112
because henry and i
have already decided that

29:49.112 --> 29:52.050
<i>we're gonna be together even
after he goes back to tucson,</i>

29:52.050 --> 29:54.313
whether you like it or not!

29:55.438 --> 29:58.144
what? nothing to say?

29:58.144 --> 30:01.425
no. my water just broke.

30:05.339 --> 30:07.139
um, are you sure
your water broke?

30:07.206 --> 30:09.439
either that
or i just peed my pants.

30:09.506 --> 30:11.406
okay, i see
how you're playing this.

30:11.473 --> 30:13.128
i remember
last new year's eve,

30:13.128 --> 30:15.506
<i>i was so drunk
that my water broke, too.</i>

30:15.573 --> 30:16.425
ohh!
aah. uhh.

30:16.425 --> 30:20.190
oh, i just had a contraction.
good idea. stick with your story.

30:20.190 --> 30:24.487
um, okay. uh, all right.
um, everything's gonna be okay.

30:24.487 --> 30:28.050
just, uh, sit. sit down
and-and try to relax. okay.

30:28.050 --> 30:29.312
breathe.
okay.

30:40.657 --> 30:41.375
hi.

30:42.250 --> 30:44.378
hi. how's your ear?

30:44.378 --> 30:46.613
eh, just a couple
of stitches.

30:46.613 --> 30:49.050
the good news is, it doesn't
stick out as far anymore.

30:49.988 --> 30:51.847
i'm so sorry,

30:51.847 --> 30:55.425
and i-i totally hear you
about gym class,

30:55.425 --> 30:59.175
so maybe justin should go.
maybe i could meet you halfway.

30:59.175 --> 31:03.050
what do you have in mind? he helps
choreograph the cheerleading routines

31:03.050 --> 31:05.000
for the rest of the year,
he passes.

31:05.612 --> 31:07.266
think he'd be into that?
are you kidding?

31:07.316 --> 31:09.487
he calls espn
"the cheerleading channel."

31:09.487 --> 31:12.500
he's gonna love it. wow.

31:13.191 --> 31:15.437
thank you, coach diaz.

31:15.831 --> 31:16.705
you're welcome.

31:20.175 --> 31:23.828
hey, um, what's
your first name, anyway?

31:23.878 --> 31:26.175
tony.
i'm hilda.

31:26.175 --> 31:28.453
nice to meet you, hilda.

31:28.503 --> 31:29.690
you, too.

31:40.750 --> 31:43.375
you know, daniel,
when i was a young man,

31:43.425 --> 31:44.738
i was a lot like you.

31:45.550 --> 31:46.375
well, maybe
not as much like you

31:46.425 --> 31:47.987
as i would have liked,

31:47.987 --> 31:51.503
but it wasn't until
i felt good about myself

31:52.113 --> 31:53.988
that i met someone special.

31:54.375 --> 31:56.362
so what happened?

31:56.362 --> 31:58.253
mole happened.

31:58.253 --> 31:59.078
is that a girl?

31:59.128 --> 31:59.969
no.

31:59.999 --> 32:03.937
it's a sauce that
everyone makes with chilies

32:03.987 --> 32:07.269
and garlic and peppercorns
and chocolate and broth,

32:07.269 --> 32:09.456
and that's how
i would make it.

32:09.456 --> 32:11.250
until one day i thought,

32:11.300 --> 32:14.675
i wonder how molasses
would make this taste.

32:14.675 --> 32:15.690
so i add molasses,

32:15.690 --> 32:17.738
serve it to my boss,

32:17.738 --> 32:19.237
eyes pop out of his head-

32:19.237 --> 32:21.050
the best thing
he's ever tasted,

32:21.050 --> 32:23.999
and i say, "i know."

32:23.999 --> 32:27.300
'cause i knew
that it was special, unique.

32:27.300 --> 32:29.703
so what, you want me
to cook something?

32:29.753 --> 32:30.800
no way.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.613
cooking was my passion.

32:33.613 --> 32:35.250
it changed the way i felt.

32:35.375 --> 32:38.925
what makes you
feel good about yourself?

32:48.125 --> 32:50.550
you're right.
i don't have any options.

32:50.550 --> 32:53.999
so i've decided
to take you up on ur offer.

32:53.999 --> 32:56.050
there is something
that i want from you.

32:56.050 --> 32:57.659
and what is that?

33:01.750 --> 33:05.500
this is the heartbeat
of the child that i'm carrying.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.125
i want you to watch it,

33:07.175 --> 33:09.425
and for once
in your monstrous life

33:09.425 --> 33:11.250
for you to think
about someone else,

33:11.300 --> 33:14.675
because this baby
is not just some instrument

33:14.675 --> 33:16.687
for whatever wicked game it is
that you're playing.

33:16.737 --> 33:21.144
it's your child, and what
i want from you is a promise

33:21.144 --> 33:22.925
that you will love this baby,

33:22.925 --> 33:26.503
and you will give it
everything that it needs.

33:34.191 --> 33:38.050
ohh, god,
this really hurts!

33:38.050 --> 33:39.500
does it hurt?

33:39.550 --> 33:40.941
i just said
that it does.

33:40.941 --> 33:43.550
you know, a few years ago,
i had some work done on my nose.

33:43.550 --> 33:44.750
it was not a nose job.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.112
<i>everybody thought
it was a nose job,</i>

33:46.112 --> 33:47.425
but it was just
to fix some breathing-

33:47.425 --> 33:49.691
had to get it done,
not a nose job-

33:49.691 --> 33:53.891
and it was so painful. it was just like childbirth.

33:53.941 --> 33:56.566
i'm sorry. are you gonna be here the whole time?

33:56.566 --> 33:57.737
whatever you need,

33:57.737 --> 33:59.675
because i know
what you're going through.

33:59.675 --> 34:03.300
okay, well,
i'm kind of thirsty, so...

34:03.300 --> 34:05.894
mm, that reminds me-
i am starving.

34:05.894 --> 34:07.938
okay, guys,
uh, thanks for coming.

34:08.339 --> 34:11.773
i just left henry a message.
he must be in the subway. okay.

34:11.840 --> 34:14.425
oh! oh, yes. taxi's here.

34:14.425 --> 34:17.175
come on. let's get you to the hospital.
no, no, no, no, no, not a hospital. no.

34:17.175 --> 34:19.550
i'm going to a birthing center.
i have a midwife.

34:19.550 --> 34:21.112
you know, i want to do this
all natural. no drugs.

34:21.112 --> 34:24.675
<i>i want to feel everything!
oh, god!</i>

34:24.675 --> 34:27.737
okay, uh, well, then let's
get you to the birthing center.

34:27.737 --> 34:31.572
we just need to get you out
the door and in the cab. okay.

34:31.639 --> 34:32.690
look, you're doing it.

34:32.690 --> 34:33.925
you're doing it.
you're doing it.

34:33.926 --> 34:37.188
i'm doing it. ohh, god!
i'll call your midwife.

34:37.237 --> 34:39.050
no, don't do that!
why?

34:39.050 --> 34:41.050
because i don't want her
to hear me say this-

34:41.050 --> 34:43.503
i want the drugs.
what?

34:43.503 --> 34:44.737
i want the drugs, betty.
call the hospital.

34:44.737 --> 34:49.112
call the ambulance.
i want the drugs!

34:49.112 --> 34:50.375
okay.
ohh!

34:50.425 --> 34:53.940
um, 9-1-1,
we have a woman in labor.

34:53.940 --> 34:55.362
aah!

34:55.362 --> 34:57.784
she wants the drugs.

35:02.999 --> 35:04.238
oh, my god.

35:04.238 --> 35:07.675
i don't want to be here
when that thing pops out of her.

35:08.063 --> 35:08.629
bye.

35:11.187 --> 35:13.250
betty,
is the ambulance here?

35:13.300 --> 35:13.875
any second.

35:13.925 --> 35:16.203
okay. okay, and henry?

35:16.253 --> 35:17.688
he's on his way.

35:17.738 --> 35:18.675
mm. mm.

35:20.050 --> 35:21.050
hold my hand.

35:21.813 --> 35:22.050
what?

35:22.050 --> 35:24.175
hold my hand.

35:25.875 --> 35:26.863
why'd you do it, betty?

35:26.863 --> 35:28.988
why did you
throw me a shower?

35:29.375 --> 35:32.800
because you're away
from home, stranded-

35:32.800 --> 35:33.737
oh, betty, that is bull!

35:33.737 --> 35:35.862
ow! okay,
maybe that's not why.

35:35.862 --> 35:39.862
maybe i did it because i thought
that if i was friendlier,

35:39.862 --> 35:41.750
you would stop
getting in the way

35:41.800 --> 35:43.313
of henry and i so much.

35:43.363 --> 35:47.113
i'm sorry, betty.
i am so sorry.

35:47.500 --> 35:50.297
t do you know how hard it was
watching the guy that i love

35:50.347 --> 35:52.425
falling in love
with somebody else?

35:54.313 --> 35:56.550
is that why
you cheated on him?

35:59.188 --> 36:00.487
charlie, i'm so sorry.

36:00.487 --> 36:04.250
no, no, no,
it's not your fault. i just...

36:04.300 --> 36:06.040
i never thought it would
be like this, you know?

36:06.106 --> 36:09.550
i never thought i'd be
having a baby... alone.

36:10.628 --> 36:13.562
no. no, no, no,
you're not alone.

36:14.688 --> 36:16.425
hurry. right in here.

36:16.425 --> 36:18.425
oh, thank god. they're here.
the ambulance is here.

36:18.425 --> 36:19.691
okay, okay.

36:20.813 --> 36:23.187
what do you do with these?
where do you begin?

36:23.237 --> 36:27.438
i see exactly what you mean.
the photos just sit there. yes.

36:27.488 --> 36:29.675
they need a point of view.
mm-hmm.

36:29.675 --> 36:31.425
can i weigh in?

36:31.750 --> 36:33.078
you look like hell.

36:33.128 --> 36:34.550
yeah, i know.

36:36.125 --> 36:38.687
ooh.
these are not very good.

36:38.737 --> 36:40.112
no. no.

36:41.828 --> 36:44.487
we could saturate the colors,
make 'em pop,

36:44.487 --> 36:47.328
that way we focus on the outfits
instead of the models... mm-hmm.

36:47.378 --> 36:50.237
so it's strictly about the
fashion. yeah, that's great.

36:50.237 --> 36:52.112
i was also thinking,

36:52.112 --> 36:54.093
we always put the photo essays
in the back of the book.

36:54.143 --> 36:55.737
why don't we move 'em
in the front?

36:55.737 --> 36:58.347
you know,
stir things up a little.

36:58.740 --> 37:01.953
well, look at you.
what happened, daniel?

37:04.188 --> 37:05.999
i realized something.

37:07.250 --> 37:10.438
i mean, i'm always looking
for meaning in my life

37:10.550 --> 37:12.862
everywhere but the place
i can actually find it-

37:13.719 --> 37:14.675
right here.

37:15.206 --> 37:18.628
<i>i love this job.</i>

37:25.312 --> 37:27.875
i'm sorry, ma'am,
but you're over 9 centimeters.

37:27.925 --> 37:30.675
i don't think it's a good idea to
move you. here. i'll get some towels.

37:30.675 --> 37:33.062
oh, god,
this really hurts.

37:33.112 --> 37:35.613
i know, but you're
too far along for the drugs.

37:35.613 --> 37:36.940
it's gonna be
the old-fashioned way.

37:36.940 --> 37:40.875
oh, the old-fashioned way,
just like you wanted.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.437
oh, shut up, betty!

37:42.487 --> 37:43.891
ow!

37:45.674 --> 37:48.507
oh, oh, i'm sorry.

37:49.503 --> 37:51.703
oh, i'm sorry. you know
i don't really mean that.

37:51.753 --> 37:54.265
i just can't believe i'm having
a baby in your living room.

37:54.315 --> 37:57.453
it's okay. it's okay.
it's okay, charlie.

37:57.503 --> 37:58.425
charlie?

38:00.250 --> 38:01.988
henry? oh, thank you so much, betty.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.050
henry, henry, henry.
d, you have no idea.

38:04.050 --> 38:05.925
betty's kept me
from totally freaking out.

38:05.925 --> 38:08.425
oh, my god. oh, my god.
this is really happening.

38:08.425 --> 38:11.363
okay. it's gonna be okay.
it's gonna be okay.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.425
um, um, here.

38:16.187 --> 38:18.488
no, no, no, no, no. stay, betty.
stay if you want. stay.

38:18.488 --> 38:22.237
yeah, betty, please stay.
no... you're gonna be okay.

38:22.469 --> 38:25.269
aah.
okay.

38:25.269 --> 38:26.644
okay. okay.

38:26.644 --> 38:28.500
it's good to
have you back, daniel.

38:28.550 --> 38:29.734
to work.

38:29.784 --> 38:32.425
to meade publications.

38:32.425 --> 38:33.893
to family.

38:42.375 --> 38:44.238
what the hell is that?

38:49.375 --> 38:52.737
that is a sonogram
of my baby,

38:53.206 --> 38:54.828
of your father's baby.

38:54.878 --> 38:59.438
what are you talking about?
i'm having your father's child.

38:59.488 --> 39:00.953
oh, dear god.

39:01.191 --> 39:02.050
and i want you to know,

39:02.050 --> 39:05.237
my only concern
is protecting this baby

39:05.237 --> 39:08.925
<i>and giving it everything
it deserves.</i>

39:09.390 --> 39:11.175
yeah,
and what would that be?

39:11.175 --> 39:14.893
one-third
of the meade empire.

39:18.687 --> 39:21.050
oh, my god.
ohh!

39:24.562 --> 39:26.750
here you go, sweetie.
no.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.828
wow.
this turned out to be

39:30.878 --> 39:32.988
one hell
of a baby shower.

39:40.313 --> 39:41.628
it's a boy.

39:41.987 --> 39:43.440
ohh.
oh.

39:47.999 --> 39:49.128
congratulations.

39:49.128 --> 39:49.628
oh, thanks.

39:49.628 --> 39:51.141
you're a papa now.

39:51.191 --> 39:52.453
<i>oh, felicidades.</i>

39:56.125 --> 39:58.050
* remember when you left? *

39:58.472 --> 40:02.063
* yeah, you had your own rules about playing the game *

40:02.113 --> 40:03.988
* and any day you could walk away *

40:03.988 --> 40:04.363
our baby.

40:04.363 --> 40:06.774
* feeling no pain *

40:07.441 --> 40:11.550
* now look at yourself *

40:11.550 --> 40:14.862
* yeah, you're all hung up on somebody else *

40:14.862 --> 40:17.765
* and in your eyes i see all the signs *

40:17.815 --> 40:20.253
* of the misery *

40:20.253 --> 40:21.188
* ooh *

40:21.300 --> 40:24.406
* you used to be so proud *

40:24.456 --> 40:26.250
* now your head's a little lower *

40:26.300 --> 40:27.641
* and you walk a little slower *

40:27.691 --> 40:29.316
* and you *

40:29.359 --> 40:31.999
* don't talk so loud *

40:33.406 --> 40:36.500
* now you've gotten wise *

40:37.125 --> 40:38.688
* yeah, you know how love *

40:38.738 --> 40:41.500
* can build you up one moment *

40:41.613 --> 40:43.816
* and t next,cut you down to size *

40:43.816 --> 40:45.188
* down to size *

40:45.238 --> 40:47.375
* and then you discover *

40:47.425 --> 40:50.875
* all she told you was a bunch of lies *

40:50.925 --> 40:54.703
* didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime? *

40:54.753 --> 40:59.141
* oh *
