ADAM CONOVER
(VOICEOVER): Previously

00:07.390 --> 00:09.000
on Adam Ruins Everything.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.010
I still have a lot to learn.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.550
I think it's time
I go see who else

00:12.550 --> 00:14.020
is out there I can learn from.

00:14.020 --> 00:15.350
Hello, my internet girlfriend.

00:15.350 --> 00:16.150
Can I live with you?

00:18.700 --> 00:19.710
How did we meet?

00:19.710 --> 00:20.980
It was so cute.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.260
We were both editing
the same Wikipedia page.

00:23.260 --> 00:25.270
We got into this
fight over what source

00:25.270 --> 00:27.020
to use for one of the citations.

00:27.020 --> 00:28.450
So we started emailing.

00:28.450 --> 00:31.120
And then we realized we both
had a significant other die

00:31.120 --> 00:32.350
on the very first date.

00:32.350 --> 00:34.330
So, one thing led to another.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.770
And a month ago
I showed up here

00:35.770 --> 00:37.450
in South Dakota
unannounced and have been

00:37.450 --> 00:41.020
staying with her ever since.

00:41.020 --> 00:42.010
Yeah, I know.

00:42.010 --> 00:44.230
You've told me this story
three times already.

00:44.230 --> 00:46.960
And it never gets old.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.700
Well, you are a
lucky man, Adam.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.460
Melinda is the best
fountain designer

00:51.460 --> 00:53.740
at our fountain design firm.

00:53.740 --> 00:56.100
And she makes a mean brunch.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.190
To new love.

01:00.780 --> 01:02.220
Champagne is lovely.

01:02.220 --> 01:04.930
Must have been expensive.

01:04.930 --> 01:06.400
Should I say?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.360
What?

01:07.360 --> 01:10.030
Well, pricey wines don't taste
any better than cheap ones.

01:10.030 --> 01:12.020
Even wine snobs can't
tell the difference.

01:12.020 --> 01:13.580
Boom!
You're ruined.

01:13.580 --> 01:14.380
God, babe.

01:14.380 --> 01:16.060
You are so cute
when you ruin stuff.

01:16.060 --> 01:20.900
Melinda says I'm an LA
6, but a South Dakota 12.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.220
Hey, look at the time.

01:23.220 --> 01:25.630
Gosh, that went so well.

01:25.630 --> 01:28.070
Even my boss loves you.

01:28.070 --> 01:29.130
I'm so amped.

01:29.130 --> 01:29.910
I know.

01:29.910 --> 01:32.580
I used to be lonely and unhappy
but meeting you fixed me

01:32.580 --> 01:34.230
and it's going to last forever.

01:34.230 --> 01:36.380
Well, what else should we
do to celebrate our love?

01:36.380 --> 01:37.910
- Dinner with your parents?
- We can't.

01:37.910 --> 01:38.610
They're dead.

01:38.610 --> 01:39.810
Oh, right.

01:39.810 --> 01:42.030
What about a romantic vacation?

01:42.030 --> 01:43.320
I love it.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.600
We can go to my favorite place
in all of South Dakota, Mt.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.300
Rushmore.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.610
Oh, and then I
can ruin it for you.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.430
Oh wait, what?

01:50.430 --> 01:51.870
This is going to be great.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.280
Hi, I'm Adam Conover.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.310
And I'm his girlfriend
Melinda Patel.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.920
And this is Adam
Ruins Everything!

01:57.920 --> 02:01.200
[THEME MUSIC]

02:08.990 --> 02:11.820
Oh, I love Mount Rushmore.

02:11.820 --> 02:15.030
The history, the grandeur,
the outdoor freeze

02:15.030 --> 02:17.520
resistant pedestal fountains.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.010
It's America's greatest
national monument.

02:20.010 --> 02:21.150
I have to disagree.

02:21.150 --> 02:21.850
Mt.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.000
Rushmore is America's
weirdest national monument,

02:24.000 --> 02:25.110
not the greatest.

02:25.110 --> 02:26.340
ADAM CONOVER
(VOICEOVER): First, it's

02:26.340 --> 02:27.990
actually surprisingly small.

02:27.990 --> 02:31.890
The heads are only 60 feet
tall, or about 1/10 the size

02:31.890 --> 02:33.750
of the Washington Monument.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.880
And it was also
it never finished.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.610
The rubble at the base is just
debris from the construction

02:38.610 --> 02:40.290
no one cleaned up.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.360
But most importantly,
the history of Mt.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.470
Rushmore is real weird.

02:44.470 --> 02:48.120
Oh yeah, I did always wonder
why we carved president heads

02:48.120 --> 02:49.860
into the side of a mountain.

02:49.860 --> 02:50.700
What's up with that?

02:50.700 --> 02:53.970
Well, this national
monument was actually designed

02:53.970 --> 02:56.430
to be a national tourist trap.

02:56.430 --> 02:59.400
In the 1920s a group of
South Dakota historians

02:59.400 --> 03:01.380
was trying to figure
out how to attract

03:01.380 --> 03:02.910
tourists to their state.

03:02.910 --> 03:06.580
Hmm, how do we get people to
come see our big boring rocks?

03:06.580 --> 03:08.630
Oh!

03:08.630 --> 03:11.880
We'll carve wild west
legends into them.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.610
Cow boy rocks.

03:14.610 --> 03:17.950
Cow boy rocks.

03:17.950 --> 03:20.290
Cow boy rocks.

03:20.290 --> 03:21.690
Cow boy rocks!

03:21.690 --> 03:24.260
Cow boy rocks!

03:24.260 --> 03:25.350
Bit of a leap.

03:25.350 --> 03:27.780
Unfortunately for them,
the sculptor they hired,

03:27.780 --> 03:29.430
a man named Gutzon Borglum--

03:29.430 --> 03:30.950
Ugh, bad name.

03:30.950 --> 03:32.880
Well, he had his own ideas.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.430
Screw this wild west crap.

03:35.430 --> 03:39.260
I shall fill your
mountain with presidents.

03:39.260 --> 03:43.610
A noble project that will
immortalize me, Gutzon Borglum.

03:43.610 --> 03:44.520
OK.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.580
But then he carved all
our greatest presidents.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.020
Washington was the first.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.480
Jefferson wrote the
Declaration of Independence.

03:51.480 --> 03:52.980
Lincoln ended slavery.

03:52.980 --> 03:56.080
And Roosevelt, he liked hunting.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.510
ADAM CONOVER (VOICEOVER): And he
was friends with the sculptor.

03:58.510 --> 04:01.590
Teddy, you are the coolest.

04:01.590 --> 04:04.980
I'm going to sculpt your
face into a mountain.

04:04.980 --> 04:09.180
Wow, you're like,
obsessed with me.

04:09.180 --> 04:11.340
That's the reason he
was on the monument?

04:11.340 --> 04:12.630
And people were cool with that?

04:12.630 --> 04:14.340
They pretty much had to be.

04:14.340 --> 04:17.640
Borglum was incredibly stubborn
about doing things his way.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.010
In fact, his original
plan for the monument

04:20.010 --> 04:22.650
was a little bit too ambitious.

04:22.650 --> 04:25.980
I'll sculpt the heads,
then their entire torsos,

04:25.980 --> 04:30.660
and inside the heads I'll
build a hall of records.

04:30.660 --> 04:33.450
And that's where we'll
store the Constitution

04:33.450 --> 04:36.930
and the Declaration
of Independence.

04:36.930 --> 04:38.400
He wanted to put
the Constitution

04:38.400 --> 04:40.030
in a mountain in South Dakota?

04:40.030 --> 04:42.440
I mean, I love South Dakota
and even I think that's insane.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.140
Yep.

04:43.140 --> 04:45.810
Borglum became so obsessed
that Congress even

04:45.810 --> 04:47.490
threatened to cut his funding.

04:47.490 --> 04:49.930
I'm not paying for
your passion project.

04:49.930 --> 04:53.850
Stick to the sculpture or
you're cut off Borglum.

04:53.850 --> 04:59.040
But he had only finished the
heads when in 1941, he died.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.750
Oh, come on!

05:00.750 --> 05:02.670
Since the sculptor
was dead and the project

05:02.670 --> 05:06.150
was out of money, his workers
decided to call it quits.

05:06.150 --> 05:09.100
Well, we did the heads and
Borglums dead, time for us

05:09.100 --> 05:11.670
to go to bed.

05:11.670 --> 05:15.180
OK, so the sculptor was
a maniac whose name sounds

05:15.180 --> 05:17.250
like some Swedish
Muppet's death rattle

05:17.250 --> 05:18.630
and the monument
was never finished.

05:18.630 --> 05:19.990
That's not so bad.

05:19.990 --> 05:23.700
And it was built on
stolen Native American land.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.720
Yeah, that's worse.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.640
ADAM CONOVER (VOICEOVER):
In 1868 the United States

05:26.640 --> 05:29.370
signed a treaty agreeing
that this land would remain

05:29.370 --> 05:31.050
part of the Sioux nation.

05:31.050 --> 05:32.230
We've taken a lot from y'all.

05:32.230 --> 05:33.750
So you keep this land
and we'll stay out.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.280
ADAM CONOVER (VOICEOVER):
But six years later,

05:35.280 --> 05:38.550
that all changed when
General Custer found gold.

05:38.550 --> 05:39.790
You found what?

05:39.790 --> 05:42.330
It's worth how much?

05:42.330 --> 05:44.340
Sorry, should have
said no take backsies.

05:47.730 --> 05:50.370
It was a real Custer fluck.

05:50.370 --> 05:53.340
In 1980, the Supreme
Court ruled this land

05:53.340 --> 05:56.850
grab unconstitutional and
ordered federal compensation

05:56.850 --> 06:01.100
now worth over $1 billion.

06:01.100 --> 06:04.330
The problem is, the Sioux
don't want the money.

06:04.330 --> 06:07.980
So to this day, it's sitting
on hold in the US treasury.

06:07.980 --> 06:10.600
Wait, why don't
you take the money?

06:10.600 --> 06:12.640
It was never about the money.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.850
We just want our land back.

06:15.850 --> 06:18.680
[EAGLE SCREECH]

06:18.680 --> 06:19.690
Think about it.

06:19.690 --> 06:23.620
Our government broke a treaty,
stole Native American land,

06:23.620 --> 06:28.380
and then carved our own
leaders' faces into it.

06:28.380 --> 06:31.990
That's such an
insult. And for what?

06:31.990 --> 06:34.440
So tourists can come see
a big version of the heads

06:34.440 --> 06:36.220
on our money?

06:36.220 --> 06:39.890
I never thought I'd say this,
but North Dakota was right.

06:39.890 --> 06:40.590
Mt.

06:40.590 --> 06:42.810
Rushmore does suck.

06:42.810 --> 06:44.260
I'm sorry.

06:44.260 --> 06:46.260
I didn't mean to ruin
your favorite place.

06:46.260 --> 06:49.050
I just thought you'd want
to know the real history.

06:49.050 --> 06:51.510
No, it's fine.

06:51.510 --> 06:54.390
How about this, why don't
we do something you like

06:54.390 --> 06:55.770
so there's nothing to ruin?

06:55.770 --> 06:57.330
Well, I love games.

06:57.330 --> 06:58.710
And there's a gas
station in Aberdeen

06:58.710 --> 07:00.660
that has a Ms. Pac-Man machine.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.920
I think we can do better.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.110
Why don't we go to Vegas?

07:04.110 --> 07:05.400
We can point out
all the engineering

07:05.400 --> 07:07.620
flaws in the Bellagio
fountain then hit the slots.

07:07.620 --> 07:09.300
That sounds great.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.280
Except, slot machines
aren't games at all,

07:11.280 --> 07:14.210
they're deliberately
engineered addiction machines.

07:14.210 --> 07:16.890
Babe, remember
we're on vacation.

07:16.890 --> 07:19.050
You don't have to find
something to ruin everywhere--

07:19.050 --> 07:20.260
never mind, I see that you do.

07:27.230 --> 07:28.690
Here we are, Sin City.

07:28.690 --> 07:31.070
It's so glamorous.

07:31.070 --> 07:34.220
Hey, they even have slot
machines right in the lobby.

07:34.220 --> 07:37.010
Wait a minute.
Adam, is that you?

07:37.010 --> 07:38.600
Yeah, once you
have a TV show you

07:38.600 --> 07:40.970
kind of lose control over
what they put your face on.

07:40.970 --> 07:43.250
Well, I'm going to go score
us tickets to Carrot Top.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.350
We have the same hair guy.

07:45.350 --> 07:46.730
Oh, don't play these.

07:46.730 --> 07:50.330
They suck you right in.

07:50.330 --> 07:51.970
Why shouldn't I play it?

07:51.970 --> 07:53.300
It's just a slot machine.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.220
Actually, today's
slot machines

07:55.220 --> 07:58.830
don't just steal your money,
they're deliberately engineered

07:58.830 --> 07:59.840
addiction.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.490
Interesting
marketing strategy.

08:01.490 --> 08:02.760
Definitely going to
play this one now.

08:05.740 --> 08:06.970
Oh, I get it.

08:06.970 --> 08:08.850
I got stuck sucked in.

08:08.850 --> 08:11.410
Whatever, I'm not
going to get addicted.

08:11.410 --> 08:13.300
In the old days,
you wouldn't have.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.490
Early slot machines
were so simple they were

08:15.490 --> 08:16.890
barely thought of as gambling.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.270
Ah shucks, Cal.

08:21.270 --> 08:22.930
We lost again.

08:22.930 --> 08:23.750
No matter.

08:23.750 --> 08:27.680
Let's cap off this harmless fun
with a harmless cocaine cola.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.620
But as slot machines
became computerized

08:33.620 --> 08:37.310
in the '80s, casinos realized
that frequent slot players

08:37.310 --> 08:39.530
could be even more
profitable then the high

08:39.530 --> 08:41.450
rollers who played table games.

08:41.450 --> 08:43.160
So they began to
look for ways to make

08:43.160 --> 08:47.340
slot machines harder to win
and more enticing to play.

08:47.340 --> 08:51.020
All right Mr. Computer,
let's get these chumps hooked.

08:51.020 --> 08:53.090
ADAM CONOVER (VOICEOVER): In the
old mechanical slot machines,

08:53.090 --> 08:55.400
the reels were
controlled by gears

08:55.400 --> 08:57.590
and the odds of landing
on any given stop

08:57.590 --> 08:59.750
were equal with each spin.

08:59.750 --> 09:02.120
But these new slots
are capable of hundreds

09:02.120 --> 09:04.520
of different virtual stops.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.910
That means casinos can program
different odds for each symbol

09:07.910 --> 09:12.090
and it takes a lot
more plays to win.

09:12.090 --> 09:15.790
And they're also programmed
to land on more near misses.

09:15.790 --> 09:18.390
A near miss makes it
look like you almost

09:18.390 --> 09:20.670
hit the jackpot, which
psychologically tricks

09:20.670 --> 09:22.770
you into feeling like
you can improve your luck

09:22.770 --> 09:24.000
the more you play.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.970
Next time will be different.

09:25.970 --> 09:27.240
ADAM CONOVER
(VOICEOVER): Yes it will.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.960
Because now, things
are even worse.

09:29.960 --> 09:34.380
Today, most machines are
video slots: bigger, flashier,

09:34.380 --> 09:36.850
and even more addictive.

09:36.850 --> 09:38.350
So many chances to win.

09:38.350 --> 09:40.320
ADAM CONOVER (VOICEOVER): Modern
slot machines are designed

09:40.320 --> 09:43.020
to be so confusing that
it's really hard to tell

09:43.020 --> 09:46.490
when you're actually losing.

09:46.490 --> 09:47.360
Woo-wee!

09:47.360 --> 09:48.880
I'm a winner.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.430
Actually, you're not.

09:50.430 --> 09:53.940
You bet $1, but
you only won $0.50.

09:53.940 --> 09:56.400
This is called a false win.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.290
The lights still
flash and the buzzers

09:58.290 --> 10:01.080
sound, so even
though you lost money

10:01.080 --> 10:04.740
you still feel like you're
winning and keep on spinning.

10:04.740 --> 10:06.630
Whatever, I can
stop if I want.

10:06.630 --> 10:10.410
You can try, but you'll
be fighting your own brain.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.020
With each false win
you get a tiny hint

10:13.020 --> 10:15.420
of dopamine, the
chemical that activates

10:15.420 --> 10:18.420
your brain's reward centers.

10:18.420 --> 10:19.500
Whoa, mama.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.110
The old noggin'
noodle's loving this.

10:22.110 --> 10:24.340
I am in the zone.

10:24.340 --> 10:28.350
The zone is what gamblers
call it when they're completely

10:28.350 --> 10:30.390
absorbed in the flow of a game.

10:30.390 --> 10:33.570
And using player loyalty
cards, casinos track your

10:33.570 --> 10:35.760
every move to keep you there.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.040
Ooh, shiny.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.840
The data on your
player loyalty card

10:42.840 --> 10:46.530
tells the casino which games you
like, how much money you bet,

10:46.530 --> 10:48.510
even what snacks you order.

10:48.510 --> 10:51.120
Most importantly, they also
know when you tend to get

10:51.120 --> 10:53.630
frustrated and walk away.

10:53.630 --> 10:56.460
Huh, I haven't won in a while.

10:56.460 --> 10:58.300
Maybe I should stop.

10:58.300 --> 11:00.180
She's coming out of it.

11:00.180 --> 11:02.580
Send in the luck
ambassador, now!

11:02.580 --> 11:04.420
Complementary fried cheese?

11:04.420 --> 11:06.090
Guess I could stay
a little while longer.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.200
Back in the zone, baby!

11:13.200 --> 11:15.600
Some machines are so
sophisticated they don't even

11:15.600 --> 11:17.070
need to interrupt your game.

11:17.070 --> 11:18.570
When you reach your
frustration point,

11:18.570 --> 11:22.170
they just put a play credit
right on your screen.

11:22.170 --> 11:25.760
The goal of all this tracking
is to keep you hooked

11:25.760 --> 11:29.240
and in the zone as
long as possible.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.460
Go away, slot
machine boyfriend.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.410
I'm no a gambling addict.

11:34.410 --> 11:36.690
I can stop any time.

11:36.690 --> 11:38.940
I'm sorry Melinda, but
the design of these games

11:38.940 --> 11:42.090
is so addictive they're not just
preying on problem gamblers,

11:42.090 --> 11:43.500
they're creating them.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.890
This is Natasha Dow Schull,
associate professor at NYU

11:46.890 --> 11:48.990
and the author of
Addiction by Design.

11:48.990 --> 11:51.240
Casinos would love you
believe that some of us

11:51.240 --> 11:53.010
are born addicts
and the rest of us

11:53.010 --> 11:54.450
will never develop a problem.

11:54.450 --> 11:58.110
But according to a 2002 study,
people who regularly play slot

11:58.110 --> 12:00.600
machines become addicted
three to four times

12:00.600 --> 12:02.890
faster then people
who play other games,

12:02.890 --> 12:04.790
even if they've never
had a problem before.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.690
I've met people whose lives were
destroyed by their addiction

12:07.690 --> 12:08.640
to slots.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.980
They've gotten divorced,
they've gone bankrupt,

12:10.980 --> 12:14.190
they've gone to jail, they've
even committed suicide.

12:14.190 --> 12:16.290
That's terrible.

12:16.290 --> 12:19.770
But the Casino wants us
to gamble responsibly.

12:19.770 --> 12:22.950
That's just them trying
to shift the blame onto you.

12:22.950 --> 12:25.860
That little sticker does nothing
compared to this hardcore

12:25.860 --> 12:27.180
addiction machine.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.150
And the Casino has no incentive
to do anything that could

12:30.150 --> 12:33.000
actually protect its customers
because slot machines are

12:33.000 --> 12:34.920
such a huge moneymaker.

12:34.920 --> 12:39.120
Upwards of 85% of the casino's
profits come from slots.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.730
And multiple studies
have shown that problem

12:41.730 --> 12:45.750
gamblers generate 30% to 60%
of total gambling revenues.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.360
Casinos are making
addictive products

12:48.360 --> 12:51.510
and profiting off of
the addicts they create.

12:51.510 --> 12:55.560
Slot machines are deliberately
engineered addiction.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.580
Deliberately
engineered addiction.

12:58.580 --> 13:00.750
Deliberately
engineered addiction.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.570
Will somebody
shut this thing up?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.380
OK my sweet, two tickets--

13:09.380 --> 13:10.170
No, no, no, Adam.

13:10.170 --> 13:11.340
We've got to get out of here.

13:11.340 --> 13:13.050
I can't believe it, but you--

13:13.050 --> 13:16.260
this machine ruined
Vegas for me.

13:16.260 --> 13:18.260
Can't we just go to a
beach somewhere where

13:18.260 --> 13:20.910
we can get fun tropical drinks
with little umbrellas in them

13:20.910 --> 13:22.070
and just relax?

13:22.070 --> 13:23.220
No more ruining.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.930
Like, what if we
just went to Hawaii?

13:24.930 --> 13:26.820
That sounds perfect.

13:26.820 --> 13:29.460
Just don't ask how Hawaii
became part of the US

13:29.460 --> 13:31.840
because that story
is real messed up.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.170
Nope, see, that's
what I'm talking--

13:37.040 --> 13:40.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

13:43.820 --> 13:46.740
Look Melinda, I got laid.

13:46.740 --> 13:49.240
I've always wanted
to do and say that.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.370
Now, this is relaxing.

13:51.370 --> 13:53.380
Let's just sit back,
sip our drinks,

13:53.380 --> 13:56.200
and enjoy all of this
traditional Hawaiian culture.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.080
Yeah, every year
over 8 million tourists

13:58.080 --> 13:59.610
come to Hawaii thinking
they're getting

13:59.610 --> 14:01.560
a traditional
Hawaiian experience.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.380
But the truth is, most of
this isn't traditional at all.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.630
Adam, that sounded like
the beginning of a ruin.

14:06.630 --> 14:07.770
You promised.

14:07.770 --> 14:08.970
Just relax.

14:08.970 --> 14:10.720
Of course, of course.

14:10.720 --> 14:15.150
But real quick, tiki bars
were invented by a California

14:15.150 --> 14:16.110
restaurant owner.

14:16.110 --> 14:18.900
And hula dancers only
started wearing grass skirts

14:18.900 --> 14:21.740
on the US vaudeville circuit.

14:21.740 --> 14:24.030
And let me guess, Hawaii
was taken from the natives

14:24.030 --> 14:26.150
by General Custer and
a sleazy Casino owner.

14:26.150 --> 14:26.980
Did I get it?

14:26.980 --> 14:28.380
Ruin over.
- Nope.

14:28.380 --> 14:32.040
The real story of Hawaii is way
weirder and darker than that.

14:32.040 --> 14:35.660
And the real irony is,
almost no one knows about it.

14:35.660 --> 14:38.220
Come on, I'll show you.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.320
Long before it became
a state, Hawaii

14:40.320 --> 14:43.080
was a full fledged
sovereign nation.

14:43.080 --> 14:43.860
They had a queen.

14:43.860 --> 14:46.370
No splashing, everyone.

14:46.370 --> 14:47.300
No splashing.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.170
ADAM CONOVER (VOICEOVER): A
democratically elected House

14:49.170 --> 14:49.950
of Representatives.

14:49.950 --> 14:52.880
All those in favor
of Marco, say Polo.

14:52.880 --> 14:53.580
Polo.

14:53.580 --> 14:56.470
ADAM CONOVER (VOICEOVER): And
ambassadors all over the world.

14:56.470 --> 15:00.990
So then I said
aloha, and aloha.

15:00.990 --> 15:03.180
Classic Hawaii.

15:03.180 --> 15:04.970
I love your country.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.760
Wow, I had no idea.

15:06.760 --> 15:07.720
So what happened?

15:07.720 --> 15:09.240
We just straight up
invaded them, didn't we?

15:09.240 --> 15:10.200
What?
No.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.800
Come on, this is a
sovereign country.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.100
We wouldn't just take it.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.990
Not yet, you wouldn't.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.210
The strange story of
Hawaiian statehood

15:18.210 --> 15:20.940
begins with a group of
white, Hawaiian businessmen.

15:20.940 --> 15:21.860
Sup.

15:21.860 --> 15:23.420
Wait, they're
white and Hawaiian?

15:23.420 --> 15:25.980
Yeah, we're the descendants
of Christian missionaries.

15:25.980 --> 15:28.740
And us white guys could do a way
better job running this place.

15:28.740 --> 15:30.570
Cheers, bros.

15:30.570 --> 15:33.240
They called themselves
the Hawaiian League

15:33.240 --> 15:36.870
and they were basically a secret
club for powerful racists.

15:36.870 --> 15:40.890
So powerful, that in 1893
they threatened a violent coup

15:40.890 --> 15:43.500
and forced the queen
to give up her throne.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.270
Out of the pool, queen!

15:45.270 --> 15:46.960
I have no choice.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.690
Hawaii is yours.

15:48.690 --> 15:50.710
Woo!

15:50.710 --> 15:51.410
What?

15:51.410 --> 15:52.220
How?

15:52.220 --> 15:53.940
Did they have an army?
- Nope.

15:53.940 --> 15:57.270
But a corrupt US ambassador did.

15:57.270 --> 16:00.030
Hey, US ambassador,
I was thinking maybe

16:00.030 --> 16:01.580
you could back me
up with some Marines

16:01.580 --> 16:03.690
until this whole coup was over.

16:03.690 --> 16:06.170
That's against the law.

16:06.170 --> 16:06.990
But what the heck.

16:06.990 --> 16:09.640
I mean, you're letting us
keep the Navy at Pearl Harbor.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.490
The Hawaiian
League also realized

16:11.490 --> 16:13.830
it would be better for
trade if they became

16:13.830 --> 16:15.600
part of the United States.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.050
So they appealed for annexation.

16:18.050 --> 16:20.280
Me and the Ambassador have
been thinking, if you annex

16:20.280 --> 16:22.140
Hawaii I'll make
a lot of scratch,

16:22.140 --> 16:23.520
you'll basically
have military control

16:23.520 --> 16:25.080
over the entire Pacific, bro.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.170
It would be rad.

16:26.170 --> 16:27.450
Hey!

16:27.450 --> 16:28.740
That's against the rules.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.560
You can't sign that
treaty with them.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.120
They stole my country.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.660
I have a petition from
95% of native Hawaiians

16:38.660 --> 16:42.330
saying we do not want to be
part of the United States.

16:42.330 --> 16:46.050
Ambassador, did you help to
overthrow a foreign government?

16:46.050 --> 16:48.420
You put me in a real bind here.

16:48.420 --> 16:50.760
Old Uncle Sam doesn't
know what to do.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.000
Conflicted, America didn't
make up its mind for years,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.640
until the start of the
Spanish-American war.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.510
Hola.

16:57.510 --> 16:58.830
Spain?

16:58.830 --> 17:00.330
Get out of here!

17:00.330 --> 17:01.410
OK, that's it!

17:01.410 --> 17:03.170
This is America now.

17:03.170 --> 17:05.270
Get him boys!
- Aye!

17:05.270 --> 17:06.270
Aye!

17:06.270 --> 17:07.710
No, get off of me!

17:07.710 --> 17:11.010
So Congress declared
they were annexing Hawaii

17:11.010 --> 17:13.640
and they were officially
declared a US territory.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.270
We still live here!

17:15.270 --> 17:17.330
My people aren't just
going away, you know!

17:17.330 --> 17:18.760
- Whatever.
- Come on.

17:18.760 --> 17:19.860
This is insane.

17:19.860 --> 17:21.570
America just took Hawaii?

17:21.570 --> 17:23.770
Yes, that's actually
how it happened.

17:23.770 --> 17:25.540
And it was illegal.

17:25.540 --> 17:28.320
This is Williamson
Chang, he's a law professor

17:28.320 --> 17:30.120
at the University of Hawaii.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.480
According to
international law in 1898,

17:33.480 --> 17:38.820
the only way to annex another
country is by war or treaty,

17:38.820 --> 17:42.540
but the United States never
invaded Hawaii and treaty

17:42.540 --> 17:45.000
attempts died in Congress.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.780
Instead, they passed a joint
resolution, which is only

17:48.780 --> 17:51.180
supposed to apply
to domestic affairs,

17:51.180 --> 17:54.600
not acquiring a foreign
sovereign nation.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.880
That means that the
annexation of Hawaii

17:56.880 --> 17:59.950
was illegal under our own laws.

17:59.950 --> 18:03.600
And the saddest part is that
for years many Hawaiians didn't

18:03.600 --> 18:05.310
know this history existed.

18:05.310 --> 18:08.400
The real story wasn't
taught in the schools.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.490
They were told that
the treaty was legal,

18:11.490 --> 18:14.070
and many native
Hawaiians believed it.

18:14.070 --> 18:15.180
That's terrible.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.070
So today, our
community is divided.

18:17.070 --> 18:20.430
There are those who would like
to see the kingdom restored.

18:20.430 --> 18:22.450
Others think it's in
Hawaii's best interests

18:22.450 --> 18:24.480
to remain part of
the United States.

18:24.480 --> 18:28.770
Regardless, an apology
for the annexation of 1898

18:28.770 --> 18:31.180
would be a huge step forward.

18:31.180 --> 18:32.730
But until then,
why don't we start

18:32.730 --> 18:34.170
with a complimentary Mai Tai.

18:37.470 --> 18:41.010
Americans travel to Hawaii
every year on vacation

18:41.010 --> 18:42.720
but when we do,
almost none of us

18:42.720 --> 18:46.810
realize that this was once
a respected sovereign nation

18:46.810 --> 18:49.290
and we just kind of took it.

18:49.290 --> 18:50.580
This is awful.

18:50.580 --> 18:51.540
Oh, I know.

18:51.540 --> 18:53.130
America's history of
foreign policy is--

18:53.130 --> 18:55.710
No, I mean this is awful.

18:55.710 --> 18:58.710
We were supposed to be having a
fun, relaxing vacation together

18:58.710 --> 19:01.640
but everywhere we went
you just ruined things.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.790
This was a terrible
first trip together.

19:04.790 --> 19:08.860
Here, go get laid by yourself.

19:08.860 --> 19:13.600
Wow, you are history's
greatest monster.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

19:16.500 --> 19:20.410
[MUSIC PLAYING]

19:20.410 --> 19:21.750
Hello, we are here
behind the scenes

19:21.750 --> 19:22.840
at Adam Ruins Everything.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.490
I'm here with Professor
Williamson Chang

19:24.490 --> 19:26.080
because I have way
more questions for him

19:26.080 --> 19:27.700
about the history of Hawaii.

19:27.700 --> 19:31.040
So, I'm very curious about
the culture of Hawaii.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.490
What was it like
before, you know,

19:33.490 --> 19:35.020
it became part of
the United States?

19:35.020 --> 19:37.030
And how did the culture change?

19:37.030 --> 19:39.190
Well, Hawaii was a kingdom.

19:39.190 --> 19:44.680
1887 Iolani Palace had lights
before the White House.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.340
Really?
Electric lights?

19:46.340 --> 19:47.290
Electric light.

19:47.290 --> 19:49.780
The native Hawaiian people
were declared the most

19:49.780 --> 19:52.420
literate people on earth.

19:52.420 --> 19:55.120
They came from a
culture which was

19:55.120 --> 19:59.110
completely sustainable before
the first Westerner came.

19:59.110 --> 20:02.860
Hawaii had 800,000 people
on these islands who lived

20:02.860 --> 20:04.750
off the land and the waters.

20:04.750 --> 20:08.830
Today, we only have,
let's say, five days

20:08.830 --> 20:10.950
worth of food on the island.

20:10.950 --> 20:13.810
If that's gone, we're
in real great trouble.

20:13.810 --> 20:15.450
So before, the
800,000 people--

20:15.450 --> 20:17.170
They were absolutely
sustainable.

20:17.170 --> 20:19.070
They didn't even have money.

20:19.070 --> 20:21.280
There was no need
for private property.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.700
Everyone had a place in society.

20:23.700 --> 20:26.470
It was very, very harmonious.

20:26.470 --> 20:28.630
Well, we'll be right back
with more Adam Ruins Everything

20:28.630 --> 20:33.160
and more Williamson
Chang right after this.

20:33.160 --> 20:37.000
[MUSIC PLAYING]

20:37.000 --> 20:38.570
Hello, we're back
behind the scenes here

20:38.570 --> 20:40.620
on Adam Ruins Everything with
Professor Williamson Chang

20:40.620 --> 20:41.990
because we've got a
couple more questions

20:41.990 --> 20:43.490
about the history of Hawaii.

20:43.490 --> 20:46.540
How did things change
after annexation?

20:46.540 --> 20:50.000
Well, the majority of people,
or the plurality of voters,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.530
were native Hawaiian.

20:51.530 --> 20:53.720
Then after the overthrow,
Hawaiians couldn't vote.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.790
They weren't allowed to vote.

20:54.790 --> 20:57.530
Native Hawaiians were not
allowed to vote in the state

20:57.530 --> 20:58.400
or federal government?

20:58.400 --> 21:02.390
They didn't have power
because, like in the South

21:02.390 --> 21:04.730
of the United States, there
were barriers to voting.

21:04.730 --> 21:07.280
Like, you have to own
$600 worth of property

21:07.280 --> 21:09.860
and have an income of so and so
and Hawaiians couldn't qualify.

21:09.860 --> 21:11.630
You have to be
loyal, and Hawaiians

21:11.630 --> 21:15.020
weren't going to side with
those who overthrew the queen.

21:15.020 --> 21:18.860
Hawaiians were so unhappy,
so depressed, they began

21:18.860 --> 21:20.990
to lose their sense of place.

21:20.990 --> 21:23.810
By the time they were
allowed to vote in 1959,

21:23.810 --> 21:26.120
they had become
a small minority.

21:26.120 --> 21:29.360
So the question of what
we do with this information

21:29.360 --> 21:32.360
is such a difficult
one, because this

21:32.360 --> 21:33.920
happened over 100 years ago.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.810
You're absolutely right.

21:35.810 --> 21:38.670
The history of Hawaii has
been kept from Hawaiians.

21:38.670 --> 21:40.610
There's been
deliberate deception.

21:40.610 --> 21:43.490
But it's been over 100
years, what do you do?

21:43.490 --> 21:47.270
Even though the original, you
know, annexation was illegal,

21:47.270 --> 21:49.980
it's sort of the
political reality today.

21:49.980 --> 21:51.230
That's a very good point.

21:51.230 --> 21:54.590
So it's difficult to
know how we would--

21:54.590 --> 21:56.540
I mean, how would you like
to see the issue addressed?

21:56.540 --> 22:02.180
This is a question that
requires deep thought.

22:02.180 --> 22:05.420
There are many Hawaiians who
say, we want the kingdom back.

22:05.420 --> 22:06.920
Some people are saying,
well, why do you

22:06.920 --> 22:08.510
want to go back to a monarchy?

22:08.510 --> 22:10.310
The question is, after
100 years of being

22:10.310 --> 22:13.160
told you're not a country,
you're not a people,

22:13.160 --> 22:13.910
no one's ready.

22:13.910 --> 22:15.380
But it seems like the
most important thing

22:15.380 --> 22:18.350
is to have an open
conversation about this.

22:18.350 --> 22:21.260
The worst part is that the
government and the people

22:21.260 --> 22:23.450
writing the textbooks
aren't open about it

22:23.450 --> 22:25.290
and aren't honest
about what happened.

22:25.290 --> 22:28.970
Well, it's like the
South African experience.

22:28.970 --> 22:31.190
So much wrong for so long.

22:31.190 --> 22:33.320
Nelson Mandela said, let's
have a process called

22:33.320 --> 22:35.790
truth and then reconciliation.

22:35.790 --> 22:38.210
So, what we're doing today
is great because it's

22:38.210 --> 22:40.280
the first step is the truth.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.920
Thank you so much for coming
on the show, Professor Chang.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.340
And now, back to Adam
Ruins Everything.

22:49.330 --> 22:52.360
Melinda, are you mad?

22:52.360 --> 22:54.620
No, I'm just sketching
a new fountain.

22:54.620 --> 22:57.520
It shoots a column of water 100
feet into the air, which then

22:57.520 --> 22:59.380
lands directly on your
dumb, adorable face

22:59.380 --> 23:01.260
because, yes, I'm mad.

23:01.260 --> 23:04.120
Yeah, that's what I thought.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.800
I just don't get
why you couldn't just

23:05.800 --> 23:08.050
relax and spend time with me.

23:08.050 --> 23:10.570
Ruining is just what I do.

23:10.570 --> 23:12.610
That's how I
connect with people.

23:12.610 --> 23:14.260
I thought you liked it.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.120
But when you're
constantly correcting me

23:16.120 --> 23:19.180
and finger snapping your
learning ghosts everywhere

23:19.180 --> 23:21.550
and telling me everything I
like has a terrible history,

23:21.550 --> 23:23.050
it makes me feel like
I'm not good enough

23:23.050 --> 23:24.310
for you or something.

23:24.310 --> 23:26.740
I didn't know
you felt that way.

23:26.740 --> 23:28.660
You probably wish
I would die just

23:28.660 --> 23:30.220
like all your other boyfriends.

23:30.220 --> 23:32.610
No, God no!

23:32.610 --> 23:34.120
I think you need to
learn how to turn

23:34.120 --> 23:35.830
it off every once in a while.

23:35.830 --> 23:38.920
Not just for me, but
because it's good for you.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.030
What do you mean?

23:40.030 --> 23:43.860
Look, as a nation, Americans
are really bad at relaxing.

23:43.860 --> 23:49.330
In 2015, we let 658 million
vacation days go unused.

23:49.330 --> 23:52.030
And even when we did go
on vacation, 30% of us

23:52.030 --> 23:52.960
brought work to do.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.030
But studies show that
going on vacation

23:55.030 --> 23:56.500
actually makes people
more productive

23:56.500 --> 23:57.760
when they go back to work.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.890
So it's really important
to take time off.

23:59.890 --> 24:03.640
And look, I really do love
it when you ruin things,

24:03.640 --> 24:05.820
that's what makes you Adam.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.750
I just think if you could take
a break every once in a while,

24:08.750 --> 24:12.150
well, that's how you'll be
the best Adam you can be.

24:12.150 --> 24:15.810
Oh, you taught me something.

24:15.810 --> 24:17.280
OK, I'll do it.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.360
For the rest of the
trip no more ruining.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.140
I am going to relax.

24:21.140 --> 24:23.900
Bartender, one virgin
Mai Tai, please.

24:23.900 --> 24:25.670
I'm proud of you, babe.

24:25.670 --> 24:27.790
Of course, it does have
a lot of sugar in it.

24:27.790 --> 24:30.430
And sugar is the
primary cause of--

24:30.430 --> 24:33.700
wait, of course, almost
ruined the moment.

24:33.700 --> 24:36.670
Yeah, almost.
