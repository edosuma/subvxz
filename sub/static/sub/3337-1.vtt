<i>Who am I? You sure you want to know?</i>

03:11.508 --> 03:14.762
<i>The story of my life</i>
<i>is not for the faint of heart.</i>

03:14.928 --> 03:17.556
<i>If somebody said</i>
<i>it was a happy little tale...</i>

03:17.765 --> 03:22.227
<i>... if somebody told you I was just an</i>
<i>average guy, not a care in the world...</i>

03:22.394 --> 03:24.188
<i>... somebody lied.</i>

03:25.063 --> 03:28.650
<i>But let me assure you, this,</i>
<i>like any story worth telling...</i>

03:28.817 --> 03:30.235
<i>... is all about a girl.</i>

03:31.111 --> 03:35.574
<i>That girl. The girl next door.</i>
<i>Mary Jane Watson.</i>

03:35.741 --> 03:38.827
<i>The woman I've loved</i>
<i>since before I liked girls.</i>

03:38.994 --> 03:41.663
<i>I'd like to tell you that's me</i>
<i>next to her.</i>

03:41.830 --> 03:43.832
<i>Aw, heck, I'd even take him.</i>

03:45.250 --> 03:47.753
Hey! Stop the bus!

03:48.754 --> 03:49.922
<i>That's me.</i>

03:50.130 --> 03:52.007
Tell him to stop! Please!

03:52.216 --> 03:53.425
Stop!

03:53.634 --> 03:55.844
Hey! Stop the bus!

03:56.011 --> 03:59.098
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven.

03:59.264 --> 04:00.516
Catch a cab, Parker!

04:04.978 --> 04:07.773
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

04:13.195 --> 04:14.488
What a geek!

04:15.155 --> 04:19.368
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

04:19.535 --> 04:21.120
Would you date him?

04:39.012 --> 04:41.223
Midtown High seniors.

04:41.390 --> 04:45.102
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.

04:45.394 --> 04:48.856
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

04:49.231 --> 04:52.484
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.903
So behave accordingly.

04:55.070 --> 04:58.115
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

04:58.323 --> 04:59.950
Come on, stay together.

05:00.117 --> 05:03.036
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

05:04.204 --> 05:07.249
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

05:07.416 --> 05:09.960
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

05:11.712 --> 05:15.549
- Can we drive around the corner?
- Why?

05:15.758 --> 05:17.551
The entrance is right there.

05:17.718 --> 05:21.430
Dad, this is public school.
I can't show up in a Rolls.

05:21.638 --> 05:23.974
I should trade my car for a Jetta...

05:24.141 --> 05:26.935
...because you flunked out
of private school?

05:27.227 --> 05:30.272
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

05:30.939 --> 05:35.277
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.

05:35.486 --> 05:36.779
It's just...

05:36.945 --> 05:38.405
Just what, Harry?

05:38.614 --> 05:40.115
Forget it.

05:43.118 --> 05:44.453
Pete!

05:44.870 --> 05:47.372
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

05:48.248 --> 05:50.459
- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks.

05:51.418 --> 05:55.380
- This is my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.

05:55.589 --> 05:59.051
- It's an honor, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.

05:59.301 --> 06:02.137
I'm something of a scientist myself.

06:02.304 --> 06:05.474
I read your research
on nanotechnology. Brilliant.

06:05.641 --> 06:08.685
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

06:08.894 --> 06:12.189
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

06:12.356 --> 06:16.902
- I live with my aunt and uncle.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!

06:17.069 --> 06:20.739
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.

06:23.075 --> 06:26.578
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.

06:26.745 --> 06:28.705
I think he wants to adopt you.

06:28.872 --> 06:29.498
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

06:29.498 --> 06:33.585
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

06:33.794 --> 06:37.589
They're in the order <i>Araneae</i>,
divided into three suborders.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.882
That's amazing!

06:39.049 --> 06:42.970
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the East Coast.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.347
It's unreal.

06:45.514 --> 06:48.308
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

06:48.517 --> 06:52.020
...varying strengths
to help them search for food.

06:52.229 --> 06:56.442
For example, the Delena spider,
family <i>Sparassidae</i>...

06:56.608 --> 07:00.779
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

07:00.946 --> 07:02.698
For the school paper?

07:07.202 --> 07:12.207
Next, we have the net web spider,
family <i>Filistatidae</i>...

07:12.416 --> 07:14.293
...genus <i>Kukulcania</i>.

07:14.543 --> 07:18.881
Spins a funnel- shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...

07:19.089 --> 07:24.344
...proportionately equal to
the high-tension wires used in bridges.

07:24.803 --> 07:26.472
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

07:26.638 --> 07:29.641
Or his father will fire your father.

07:30.058 --> 07:32.394
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

07:32.561 --> 07:35.064
What is going on?

07:35.230 --> 07:38.317
The next person who talks
will fail this course.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.527
- This spider...
- Let's go.

07:40.694 --> 07:44.865
...hunts using reflexes with
n <i>erve</i>- conduction velocity so fast...

07:45.074 --> 07:48.577
...that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

07:48.744 --> 07:50.913
- An early awareness of danger.
- Jerks.

07:51.121 --> 07:52.873
A spider- sense.

07:53.499 --> 07:55.167
Hey, look at that spider.

07:55.334 --> 07:59.755
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

08:00.005 --> 08:01.924
It's a defense mechanism.

08:02.091 --> 08:05.385
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?

08:05.552 --> 08:06.762
Who wouldn't?

08:06.929 --> 08:10.766
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's research facility...

08:10.933 --> 08:15.312
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

08:15.521 --> 08:20.275
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.

08:20.484 --> 08:24.154
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

08:24.363 --> 08:25.739
I love them!

08:26.281 --> 08:27.950
Yeah, me too.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.788
You know, spiders can change
their color...

08:32.955 --> 08:36.792
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?

08:36.958 --> 08:41.087
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.

08:41.296 --> 08:44.675
- Transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

08:44.842 --> 08:47.970
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

08:48.137 --> 08:52.808
...into these 15 genetically
designed super- spiders.

08:52.975 --> 08:54.476
There's 14.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.311
I beg your pardon?

08:56.478 --> 08:59.022
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.570
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

09:05.070 --> 09:09.783
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the East Coast?

09:09.950 --> 09:14.037
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

09:14.204 --> 09:15.956
Let's talk about listening.

09:20.043 --> 09:22.796
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

09:22.796 --> 09:24.131
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

09:24.339 --> 09:26.216
...but at Midtown High...

09:34.683 --> 09:38.437
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

09:38.604 --> 09:40.064
- Sure.
- Great.

09:40.272 --> 09:42.566
Where do you want me?
Over here?

09:42.775 --> 09:44.109
Yeah, that's great.

09:44.526 --> 09:46.195
Don't make me look ugly.

09:46.570 --> 09:48.405
That's impossible.

09:55.662 --> 09:56.914
Perfect.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.215
- Is that good?
- Great.

10:11.762 --> 10:13.138
That's great.

10:18.727 --> 10:20.729
M.J., let's go!

10:22.272 --> 10:24.858
Wait. Thanks!

10:38.330 --> 10:41.083
Parker, let's do it.

10:57.808 --> 11:01.270
We've solved the horizon glide
and the balance issues.

11:01.437 --> 11:03.981
I've already seen the glider.

11:04.398 --> 11:06.442
That's not what I'm here for.

11:06.650 --> 11:09.319
General Slocum, good to see you again.

11:10.154 --> 11:12.322
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

11:12.573 --> 11:14.408
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

11:14.575 --> 11:18.120
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

11:18.328 --> 11:21.749
I want the report on human
performance enhancers.

11:21.915 --> 11:26.420
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.

11:26.587 --> 11:28.464
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?

11:28.630 --> 11:29.715
Once.

11:29.882 --> 11:32.551
All the tests since
have been successful.

11:32.718 --> 11:36.472
In the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?

11:36.638 --> 11:38.974
Violence, aggression...

11:39.641 --> 11:40.893
...and insanity.

11:41.059 --> 11:43.812
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

11:44.063 --> 11:47.900
Except for Dr. Stromm,
our staff certifies the product...

11:48.067 --> 11:50.986
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

11:52.321 --> 11:55.991
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

11:57.242 --> 11:59.661
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

12:00.829 --> 12:02.664
I'll be frank with you.

12:02.915 --> 12:07.753
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.672
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...

12:10.839 --> 12:13.759
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton.

12:14.093 --> 12:18.013
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...

12:18.180 --> 12:22.267
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

12:22.518 --> 12:26.897
...l'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

12:28.690 --> 12:30.359
Gentlemen. Ladies.

12:35.447 --> 12:40.869
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voilÃ ! There is light.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.205
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

12:43.372 --> 12:48.210
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

12:48.544 --> 12:50.963
I'm already on my ass, May.

12:51.130 --> 12:55.634
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

12:55.801 --> 12:58.512
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.056
Hand me that dish. The green one.

13:01.306 --> 13:04.059
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

13:04.518 --> 13:06.395
...and upsizing their profits.

13:06.645 --> 13:09.565
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

13:10.566 --> 13:13.485
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

13:14.611 --> 13:17.406
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

13:17.573 --> 13:19.199
Computer...

13:19.408 --> 13:23.162
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

13:23.328 --> 13:27.082
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

13:27.374 --> 13:32.671
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.758
I love you. And Peter loves you.

13:36.008 --> 13:39.261
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

13:39.511 --> 13:43.932
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

13:45.058 --> 13:49.354
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.

13:49.563 --> 13:52.107
How you doing? How was the field trip?

13:52.274 --> 13:55.110
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

13:55.277 --> 13:57.780
- You won't have a bite?
- Had a bite.

13:57.946 --> 14:00.365
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

14:01.200 --> 14:04.036
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

14:05.454 --> 14:07.039
What's that all about?

14:28.310 --> 14:30.521
<i>In this recombination lab...</i>

14:30.687 --> 14:35.317
<i>... we use synthesized transfer RNA</i>
<i>to encode an entirely new genome...</i>

14:35.526 --> 14:38.570
<i>... combining the genetic</i>
<i>information from all three...</i>

14:38.779 --> 14:43.575
<i>... into these 15 genetically</i>
<i>designed super-spiders.</i>

14:58.048 --> 15:02.010
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

15:02.177 --> 15:05.514
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

15:05.681 --> 15:09.351
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

15:09.518 --> 15:11.729
Don't be a coward.

15:12.187 --> 15:14.773
Risks are part of laboratory science.

15:14.982 --> 15:18.694
Let me reschedule,
with a medical staff and a volunteer.

15:18.902 --> 15:21.363
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks?

15:21.530 --> 15:26.034
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.954
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

15:29.121 --> 15:31.790
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

15:31.957 --> 15:35.711
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

15:38.630 --> 15:40.299
40,000 years of evolution...

15:40.466 --> 15:44.219
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

15:58.067 --> 15:59.401
Oh, that's cold.

16:57.876 --> 16:59.128
Norman?

17:03.632 --> 17:04.925
Norman!

17:15.644 --> 17:16.979
Oh, my God.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.897
Oh, my God!

17:22.568 --> 17:24.403
Oh, my God! Norman!

17:40.794 --> 17:42.421
Back to formula?

18:17.039 --> 18:18.540
Weird.

18:29.468 --> 18:30.844
- Peter?
- Yeah?

18:31.053 --> 18:32.805
Are you all right?

18:34.723 --> 18:36.350
I'm fine.

18:36.934 --> 18:40.312
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?

18:41.313 --> 18:43.232
Yep. Big change.

18:43.399 --> 18:47.403
- Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
- Right.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.172
Okay.

19:11.885 --> 19:15.681
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.558
- I got better.
- See?

19:17.724 --> 19:21.103
- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?

19:21.270 --> 19:24.940
Don't forget, we're painting
the kitchen after school.

19:25.107 --> 19:27.901
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

19:28.110 --> 19:30.195
And don't start up with me.

19:31.780 --> 19:35.451
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

19:36.410 --> 19:40.122
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

19:40.289 --> 19:43.876
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?

20:01.268 --> 20:02.936
Hi, M.J.

20:03.812 --> 20:05.314
Hey, M.J.

20:05.564 --> 20:10.110
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.

20:10.277 --> 20:13.614
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

20:13.822 --> 20:15.115
I got the car. Hop in.

20:15.282 --> 20:18.160
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

20:18.368 --> 20:22.206
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

20:22.456 --> 20:23.707
Or not.

20:29.171 --> 20:31.882
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

20:33.425 --> 20:35.969
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!

20:36.386 --> 20:38.013
Tell him to stop.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.682
- Check him out!
- Dork!

21:03.163 --> 21:04.415
Dad!

21:04.873 --> 21:06.750
Dad, are you all right?

21:07.584 --> 21:08.877
Harry.

21:12.214 --> 21:14.216
What are you doing on the floor?

21:14.383 --> 21:15.717
I don't know.

21:16.552 --> 21:18.887
Have you been there all night?

21:20.889 --> 21:22.141
Last night I was...

21:24.476 --> 21:25.728
What?

21:26.979 --> 21:29.398
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

21:29.606 --> 21:31.275
Sir, I asked her to wait.

21:31.442 --> 21:35.779
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

21:35.946 --> 21:36.989
What?

21:37.156 --> 21:40.743
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

21:40.909 --> 21:44.288
- What?
- And the flight suit and the glider...

21:44.455 --> 21:46.457
- What about it?
- Stolen, sir.

22:11.398 --> 22:14.151
Wow! Great reflexes!

22:15.027 --> 22:17.196
- Thanks.
- No problem.

22:18.280 --> 22:22.201
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

22:22.951 --> 22:24.620
You just get contacts?

22:31.376 --> 22:33.545
Well, see you.

23:15.337 --> 23:18.841
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

23:19.299 --> 23:20.676
Did you see that?

23:22.261 --> 23:23.929
Parker?

23:55.794 --> 23:58.213
- It's a fight!
- Think you're funny?

23:58.380 --> 24:01.383
- It was an accident.
- So is my breaking your teeth.

24:01.592 --> 24:04.303
- Flash, stop.
- I don't want to fight you.

24:04.470 --> 24:07.890
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.

24:26.784 --> 24:28.118
Help him, Harry.

24:33.082 --> 24:34.583
How'd he do that?

24:35.667 --> 24:36.919
Which one?

24:37.086 --> 24:38.462
He's all yours, man.

24:53.977 --> 24:55.687
Flash, get up!

24:57.314 --> 25:00.442
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

25:02.361 --> 25:03.862
That was amazing.

25:04.780 --> 25:06.782
I'm out of here. Come on.

26:51.970 --> 26:53.013
Go, web!

26:54.598 --> 26:56.225
Fly.

26:57.810 --> 26:59.895
Up, up and away, web.

27:01.480 --> 27:02.898
Shazam!

27:03.482 --> 27:04.733
Go! Go!

27:04.983 --> 27:06.735
Go, web, go!

27:39.852 --> 27:41.603
Tallyho.

28:25.522 --> 28:28.108
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

28:28.317 --> 28:29.568
Bring me some beer.

28:29.777 --> 28:32.321
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...

28:32.488 --> 28:33.989
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

28:34.156 --> 28:36.492
You're as stupid as your mother.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.954
Where's she going?
Where you going?

28:42.039 --> 28:45.375
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.

28:45.584 --> 28:48.879
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

28:49.088 --> 28:53.217
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!

28:53.425 --> 28:55.928
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

28:56.261 --> 28:59.515
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

28:59.681 --> 29:02.434
I guess you can always hear us.

29:02.601 --> 29:04.895
Everybody shouts.

29:05.354 --> 29:07.481
Your aunt and uncle don't.

29:07.648 --> 29:10.192
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

29:11.610 --> 29:15.823
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...

29:16.073 --> 29:17.699
You really freaked us out.

29:17.908 --> 29:20.160
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

29:20.452 --> 29:24.415
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

29:27.501 --> 29:30.712
So where are you going
after you graduate?

29:35.467 --> 29:37.761
I wanna move into the city.

29:38.679 --> 29:43.475
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.

29:43.642 --> 29:46.478
Work my way through college.

29:47.479 --> 29:48.814
What about you?

29:48.981 --> 29:50.983
Headed for the city too.

29:51.692 --> 29:53.944
Can't wait to get out of here.

29:55.112 --> 29:56.613
I wanna...

29:57.865 --> 29:59.366
What?

30:02.202 --> 30:04.455
No, come on. Try me.

30:05.372 --> 30:06.874
I wanna...

30:08.000 --> 30:09.334
...act...

30:10.502 --> 30:12.004
...on-stage.

30:12.588 --> 30:14.423
Really?

30:14.798 --> 30:16.967
Oh, that's perfect.

30:17.259 --> 30:19.803
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

30:20.137 --> 30:21.972
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:22.598 --> 30:25.601
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

30:26.101 --> 30:28.312
Peter, that was first grade.

30:28.812 --> 30:30.314
Well...

30:30.856 --> 30:32.357
...even so.

30:33.358 --> 30:35.277
Sometimes...

30:36.111 --> 30:37.780
...you know people.

30:38.947 --> 30:42.534
You can just see what's coming.

30:45.621 --> 30:48.373
What do you see coming for you?

30:50.959 --> 30:52.628
I don't know.

30:54.963 --> 30:59.635
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

31:03.222 --> 31:06.141
And what for me?

31:06.308 --> 31:07.643
For you?

31:09.061 --> 31:11.814
You're gonna light up Broadway.

31:13.315 --> 31:14.650
You know...

31:19.029 --> 31:21.657
...you're taller than you look.

31:21.824 --> 31:23.367
I hunch.

31:25.619 --> 31:27.121
Don't.

31:30.666 --> 31:34.211
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

31:35.295 --> 31:36.588
Come on.

31:37.673 --> 31:39.007
I gotta go.

31:39.842 --> 31:41.009
Bye.

31:41.677 --> 31:44.346
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.

31:44.513 --> 31:46.515
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

31:46.682 --> 31:48.934
Oh, my God. What a cool car!

31:49.184 --> 31:50.769
Pretty tight, huh?

31:51.186 --> 31:55.524
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

31:57.276 --> 31:58.527
Cool car.

33:31.245 --> 33:33.288
What's going on in there?

33:33.497 --> 33:36.125
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

33:36.291 --> 33:39.962
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

33:40.254 --> 33:42.339
Okay. Thanks.

34:13.161 --> 34:16.498
Something's wrong.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me.

34:16.665 --> 34:19.333
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.

34:20.127 --> 34:22.170
I just don't know anymore.

34:22.588 --> 34:25.132
I'm going to the library.
See you later.

34:25.340 --> 34:28.719
- Wait. I'll drive you there.
- I'll take the train.

34:28.886 --> 34:32.139
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

34:43.192 --> 34:46.652
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait. We need to talk.

34:46.820 --> 34:51.199
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

34:52.076 --> 34:54.328
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

34:54.495 --> 34:58.540
We haven't talked for so long.
May and I don't know who you are.

34:58.707 --> 35:03.712
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

35:03.879 --> 35:08.008
- You start fights at school.
- I told you I didn't start that fight.

35:08.217 --> 35:11.178
- You sure finished it.
- Was I supposed to run away?

35:11.387 --> 35:14.390
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

35:14.556 --> 35:19.103
You're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

35:19.311 --> 35:21.313
No. Not exactly.

35:22.689 --> 35:25.401
These are the years
when a man changes...

35:25.567 --> 35:29.571
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

35:29.738 --> 35:32.825
Just be careful who you change into.

35:34.368 --> 35:38.872
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably des <i>erve</i> d what happened.

35:39.415 --> 35:42.126
But just because you can
beat him up...

35:42.584 --> 35:44.837
...doesn't give you the right to.

35:45.504 --> 35:50.759
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

35:51.343 --> 35:56.348
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

35:56.515 --> 35:59.935
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing.

36:00.227 --> 36:04.440
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know I'm not your father.

36:04.606 --> 36:07.443
Then stop pretending to be!

36:11.530 --> 36:12.781
Right.

36:15.743 --> 36:17.703
I'll pick you up here at 10.

36:48.942 --> 36:49.443
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

36:49.443 --> 36:51.612
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

36:51.612 --> 36:54.782
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

36:59.495 --> 37:03.540
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

37:07.669 --> 37:09.880
Ladies and gentlemen...

37:10.047 --> 37:14.593
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

37:17.679 --> 37:21.350
For $3000...

37:21.517 --> 37:25.145
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

37:25.312 --> 37:30.025
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

37:32.611 --> 37:34.696
Who?

37:34.947 --> 37:36.824
I know who.

37:37.032 --> 37:41.829
The Flying Dutchman!

37:42.162 --> 37:43.622
Next.

37:44.456 --> 37:47.751
There's no featherweight
division here. Next.

37:47.918 --> 37:49.753
No, no. Sign me up.

37:50.170 --> 37:53.590
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

37:53.799 --> 37:57.970
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain in said event?

37:58.178 --> 38:01.306
And you're participating
under your own free will?

38:01.473 --> 38:05.519
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

38:08.105 --> 38:10.357
Told you! Told you!

38:10.566 --> 38:12.359
Winner!

38:12.568 --> 38:13.777
Next victim!

38:15.654 --> 38:18.532
Are you ready for more?

38:19.658 --> 38:23.245
Bone Saw is ready!

38:25.664 --> 38:30.335
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

38:30.544 --> 38:35.257
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

38:35.507 --> 38:39.887
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...

38:40.763 --> 38:43.766
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

38:44.349 --> 38:46.727
That's it? That's the best you got?

38:46.894 --> 38:49.021
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

38:49.188 --> 38:53.692
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

38:53.859 --> 38:57.112
...the terrifying, the deadly...

38:57.362 --> 39:00.574
...the amazing Spider- Man!

39:02.951 --> 39:05.579
- It's "The Human Spider."
- Get out there.

39:05.746 --> 39:08.791
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.

39:11.293 --> 39:13.837
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out.

39:14.088 --> 39:16.131
I hope you brought your mommy.

39:16.298 --> 39:20.552
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

39:21.095 --> 39:26.225
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

39:26.725 --> 39:28.769
Oh, my God!

39:28.977 --> 39:30.604
Oh, my legs!

39:30.771 --> 39:33.399
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

39:33.565 --> 39:35.567
Kill! Kill! Kill!

39:43.826 --> 39:45.327
Cage! Cage! Cage!

39:45.494 --> 39:46.703
Cage!

39:56.046 --> 39:57.506
Hello? Guys?

39:58.549 --> 40:03.512
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

40:04.221 --> 40:08.517
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

40:09.685 --> 40:12.187
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

40:12.396 --> 40:14.189
Hey, freak show!

40:14.398 --> 40:17.025
You're going nowhere.

40:17.192 --> 40:19.570
I got you for three minutes.

40:19.737 --> 40:22.030
Three minutes of playtime.

40:28.662 --> 40:32.124
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

40:32.332 --> 40:36.378
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

40:42.051 --> 40:43.594
Finish him off!

40:50.768 --> 40:52.311
Smash him!

40:59.485 --> 41:01.236
- Hit him!
- Harder!

41:03.238 --> 41:05.574
Kick his spider ass!

41:07.576 --> 41:08.744
Hit him!

41:22.174 --> 41:23.967
One, two, three!

41:24.176 --> 41:26.970
That's it! That's it!
Winner!

41:27.137 --> 41:32.226
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider- Man!

41:49.618 --> 41:51.286
Now get out of here.

41:52.913 --> 41:55.749
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.

41:55.958 --> 41:58.335
Well, check it again, webhead.

41:58.502 --> 42:02.381
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

42:02.589 --> 42:05.968
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

42:06.135 --> 42:07.511
I need that money.

42:07.970 --> 42:11.056
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

42:19.148 --> 42:22.484
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.

42:24.319 --> 42:25.654
Hurry up!

42:31.994 --> 42:34.079
Hey! He stole the gate!

42:34.246 --> 42:36.206
Stop that guy!

42:36.498 --> 42:39.042
Stop him! He's got my money!

42:39.251 --> 42:40.502
Thanks.

42:41.754 --> 42:44.131
What's wrong with you?
You let him go!

42:44.298 --> 42:46.550
Cut him off and call the cops!

42:46.717 --> 42:50.763
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away.

42:50.929 --> 42:54.308
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

43:12.701 --> 43:13.911
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

43:13.911 --> 43:15.621
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

43:16.872 --> 43:18.248
Old dude, man.

43:18.457 --> 43:22.628
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

43:22.795 --> 43:25.631
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

43:28.008 --> 43:31.220
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.555
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

43:35.724 --> 43:38.352
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

43:38.477 --> 43:42.022
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

43:42.231 --> 43:43.607
Uncle Ben?

43:44.525 --> 43:46.026
Uncle Ben.

43:49.780 --> 43:51.115
Uncle Ben?

43:54.743 --> 43:56.245
Peter.

43:57.121 --> 43:58.914
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

44:04.545 --> 44:05.754
Peter.

44:27.735 --> 44:30.779
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.

44:30.988 --> 44:35.701
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

47:12.816 --> 47:14.735
Get a unit to the rear!

47:17.780 --> 47:19.323
I got the back!

47:32.252 --> 47:33.587
Who's there?

47:59.863 --> 48:02.991
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

48:03.158 --> 48:07.663
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

48:07.830 --> 48:09.331
Answer me!

48:12.668 --> 48:14.002
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

48:19.466 --> 48:21.176
<i>Thanks.</i>

48:31.061 --> 48:32.187
See you.

48:53.876 --> 48:57.337
<i>Freeze! We've got the place</i>
<i>completely surrounded.</i>

49:39.838 --> 49:42.508
Oh, no. My God.

49:44.385 --> 49:48.097
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

49:56.438 --> 49:59.400
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

50:00.192 --> 50:03.070
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.

50:03.237 --> 50:08.659
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

50:09.368 --> 50:12.913
- He's clear! Go!
- You're confident about this test?

50:13.080 --> 50:15.374
Absolutely. Curtis is our top pilot.

50:16.125 --> 50:18.877
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

50:19.044 --> 50:22.965
Nothing would please me more
than to put Osborn out of business.

50:25.300 --> 50:28.345
Preflight complete. Mark.

50:32.474 --> 50:35.102
<i>An unidentified object</i>
<i>is closing fast.</i>

50:35.269 --> 50:36.353
What's that?

50:36.520 --> 50:38.021
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

50:38.480 --> 50:39.857
Oh, my God!

50:50.159 --> 50:52.995
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

50:53.495 --> 50:55.372
Peter!

50:55.581 --> 51:00.127
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

51:00.294 --> 51:03.797
Dad got the place in New York,
so we're all set for fall.

51:03.964 --> 51:05.507
- Great!
- You made it.

51:08.260 --> 51:11.597
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

51:13.015 --> 51:15.184
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

51:15.601 --> 51:18.187
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

51:18.604 --> 51:19.897
Yeah.

51:22.858 --> 51:26.236
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

51:26.403 --> 51:29.656
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

51:29.865 --> 51:31.408
Commencement:

51:31.575 --> 51:35.704
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

51:37.539 --> 51:41.210
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

51:42.086 --> 51:43.962
You know what? Whatever.

51:44.505 --> 51:45.964
Your loss.

51:46.673 --> 51:50.219
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

51:50.386 --> 51:54.223
And if you ever need anything,
give me a call.

52:08.112 --> 52:10.364
Can I fix you something?

52:10.531 --> 52:12.032
No, thanks.

52:56.785 --> 52:58.996
I missed him a lot today.

53:01.582 --> 53:03.083
I know.

53:04.835 --> 53:06.670
I miss him too.

53:08.422 --> 53:10.758
But he was there.

53:13.927 --> 53:19.141
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

53:19.433 --> 53:24.354
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

53:26.106 --> 53:28.192
You loved him...

53:29.860 --> 53:32.112
...and he loved you.

53:32.988 --> 53:36.658
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

53:36.825 --> 53:40.287
How you were meant for great things.

53:40.829 --> 53:43.165
You won't disappoint him.

54:16.698 --> 54:20.869
<i>With great power</i>
<i>comes great responsibility.</i>

54:21.036 --> 54:24.248
<i>Remember that, Pete. Remember that.</i>

54:34.258 --> 54:35.509
Hurry up!

54:47.896 --> 54:51.650
He's not a man. My brother saw him
build a nest in Lincoln Center.

54:51.817 --> 54:55.028
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.

54:59.116 --> 55:01.869
Bobby. Get a load of this!

55:05.038 --> 55:09.293
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out, and he climbs up them.

55:09.585 --> 55:13.714
I see the web, his signature,
and I know Spider- Man was here.

55:13.881 --> 55:16.508
The guy protects us,
protects the people.

55:16.675 --> 55:19.428
Some kind of freakyloo or something.

55:19.595 --> 55:21.638
He stinks and I don't like him.

55:22.347 --> 55:23.932
Don't move, lady!

55:32.024 --> 55:34.777
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

55:34.985 --> 55:37.112
Those tights and that tight little...

55:37.279 --> 55:40.616
<i>Dresses like a spider</i>
<i>He looks like a bug</i>

55:40.824 --> 55:44.578
<i>But we should all just give him</i>
<i>One big hug</i>

55:44.787 --> 55:49.374
<i>Look out</i>
<i>Here comes the Spider-Man</i>

55:53.045 --> 55:56.799
"Who is Spider- Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

55:56.965 --> 55:59.093
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

55:59.093 --> 55:59.968
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

55:59.968 --> 56:00.969
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

56:00.969 --> 56:01.470
<i>Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...</i>

56:01.470 --> 56:02.471
<i>Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...</i>

56:03.472 --> 56:04.306
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.

56:04.306 --> 56:06.642
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.

56:06.809 --> 56:08.352
- Well?
- He's news.

56:08.560 --> 56:11.063
- The clients can't wait.
- They're about to.

56:11.230 --> 56:15.234
- He pulled six people off a subway.
- From a wreck he probably caused.

56:15.401 --> 56:19.571
Something goes wrong and he's there.
Look! He's fleeing the scene.

56:19.738 --> 56:23.700
He's probably going to save
somebody else. He's a hero!

56:23.867 --> 56:26.662
Then why the mask?
What's he got to hide?

56:26.829 --> 56:29.873
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille.

56:30.040 --> 56:32.501
- Whichever's cheaper.
- It's like this:

56:32.668 --> 56:36.505
We double- booked page six.
Macy's and Conway's both have...

56:36.672 --> 56:39.842
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

56:40.008 --> 56:41.218
Every copy.

56:42.010 --> 56:45.597
Tomorrow, Spider- Man, page one.
Move Conway to page seven.

56:45.764 --> 56:48.684
- That's a problem.
- Then make it page eight.

56:48.851 --> 56:50.519
- That can't be done.
- Get out!

56:50.686 --> 56:55.566
We can't get a decent picture. Eddie's
on it, but we can barely see him.

56:55.733 --> 56:57.860
Aw, what is he, shy?

56:58.026 --> 57:02.030
If we can get Julia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.

57:02.197 --> 57:05.617
On the front page:
"Cash for a Spider- Man picture."

57:05.784 --> 57:09.246
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

57:21.717 --> 57:23.135
Buzz off.

57:23.844 --> 57:26.805
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!

57:28.515 --> 57:33.395
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?

57:33.896 --> 57:37.608
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting?

57:37.775 --> 57:38.817
Yeah.

57:39.026 --> 57:42.905
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

57:43.072 --> 57:44.239
That's great.

57:44.823 --> 57:48.035
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Glamour girl!

57:48.202 --> 57:49.828
Your drawer was short $6!

57:49.995 --> 57:52.623
Next time, I'll take it
from your check.

57:53.707 --> 57:57.503
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

57:57.711 --> 58:00.005
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

58:00.172 --> 58:04.301
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

58:11.266 --> 58:12.976
Some dream, huh?

58:13.852 --> 58:16.480
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

58:16.647 --> 58:19.441
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

58:19.858 --> 58:24.446
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

58:24.863 --> 58:26.448
Oh, yeah. Right.

58:26.698 --> 58:29.785
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

58:29.952 --> 58:34.373
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.

58:34.706 --> 58:39.044
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.

58:40.546 --> 58:42.464
No, I guess not.

58:47.469 --> 58:49.054
Thanks, Pete.

58:50.472 --> 58:52.391
We should catch up sometime.

58:56.603 --> 58:59.148
Let's get some lunch some evening.

59:00.399 --> 59:04.903
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

59:05.112 --> 59:07.823
- And I won't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry.

59:07.990 --> 59:09.241
I won't.

59:11.410 --> 59:13.162
I won't tell Harry.

59:24.465 --> 59:26.925
Timing's perfect. Hey.

59:27.134 --> 59:30.429
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

59:32.556 --> 59:35.267
Norman's making his weekly inspection.

59:36.060 --> 59:38.312
Spent half of it on the phone.

59:38.896 --> 59:43.609
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

59:44.443 --> 59:45.736
Are you all right?

59:47.071 --> 59:51.617
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

59:52.910 --> 59:55.871
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

59:56.038 --> 59:57.581
You were late again?

59:58.207 --> 01:00:02.169
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

01:00:02.336 --> 01:00:03.587
Around.

01:00:03.754 --> 01:00:05.464
Peter Parker.

01:00:05.798 --> 01:00:08.300
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who?

01:00:08.467 --> 01:00:11.553
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.

01:00:11.929 --> 01:00:13.597
When do I get to meet her?

01:00:13.764 --> 01:00:17.059
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

01:00:19.937 --> 01:00:23.190
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

01:00:23.399 --> 01:00:26.235
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

01:00:26.402 --> 01:00:30.739
- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- I'll make a few calls.

01:00:30.906 --> 01:00:35.202
I couldn't accept it. I like to earn
what I get. I'll find work.

01:00:35.411 --> 01:00:37.037
I respect that.

01:00:37.746 --> 01:00:39.873
You want to make it on your own.

01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:41.875
That's great.

01:00:42.751 --> 01:00:45.087
What other skills do you have?

01:00:45.295 --> 01:00:47.423
I was thinking about photography.

01:00:50.384 --> 01:00:51.635
Hello.

01:00:53.554 --> 01:00:55.848
Let's go! Move it!

01:00:57.015 --> 01:00:58.684
Watch the street!

01:01:14.116 --> 01:01:15.492
Cheese!

01:01:24.418 --> 01:01:25.711
They're crap.

01:01:25.919 --> 01:01:28.881
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:32.259
- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.

01:01:32.468 --> 01:01:34.219
Take them somewhere else.

01:01:34.636 --> 01:01:38.724
<i>- Your wife says the tile's out of stock.</i>
- We'll put a rug there.

01:01:39.099 --> 01:01:41.060
Sit down. Give me that.

01:01:42.644 --> 01:01:45.189
Give you 300.
That's the standard fee.

01:01:45.355 --> 01:01:47.691
- Scrap page one. Run that.
- Headline?

01:01:47.983 --> 01:01:51.195
"Spider- Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Photos."

01:01:51.361 --> 01:01:54.490
- Menace? He was protecting...
- You take the photos...

01:01:54.698 --> 01:01:57.367
...l'll make up the headlines. Okay?

01:01:57.534 --> 01:01:59.536
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.

01:01:59.995 --> 01:02:03.499
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

01:02:03.957 --> 01:02:06.752
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.587
Best thing for you.

01:02:08.796 --> 01:02:13.092
You bring me more shots of that clown,
maybe I'll buy them.

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:16.261
But I never said you have a job. Meat.

01:02:16.428 --> 01:02:20.724
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Bring me more photos.

01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:23.519
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:02:23.727 --> 01:02:27.147
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

01:02:28.232 --> 01:02:31.360
- Welcome to th <i>e Daily Bugle</i>.
- Thank you.

01:02:31.902 --> 01:02:33.278
I'm Peter Parker.

01:02:35.781 --> 01:02:37.950
I'm a photographer.

01:02:38.742 --> 01:02:41.286
Yes. I can see that.

01:02:49.002 --> 01:02:50.838
As of today...

01:02:51.004 --> 01:02:55.008
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...

01:02:55.259 --> 01:02:59.680
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

01:02:59.847 --> 01:03:02.683
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:06.019
...costs are down, revenues are up...

01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:09.106
...and our stock
has never been higher.

01:03:09.273 --> 01:03:13.694
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.

01:03:14.528 --> 01:03:15.779
What?

01:03:15.988 --> 01:03:21.118
Quest is recapitalizing in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.

01:03:21.368 --> 01:03:24.121
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

01:03:24.288 --> 01:03:25.456
Why wasn't I told?

01:03:25.622 --> 01:03:29.710
They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.

01:03:30.002 --> 01:03:32.296
The deal is off if you come with it.

01:03:32.463 --> 01:03:35.883
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

01:03:36.091 --> 01:03:38.052
You can't do this to me.

01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:43.515
I started this company.

01:03:44.558 --> 01:03:46.977
You know how much I sacrificed?!

01:03:50.814 --> 01:03:56.278
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:00.824
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

01:04:00.991 --> 01:04:02.493
I'm sorry.

01:04:03.494 --> 01:04:05.621
You're out, Norman.

01:04:15.506 --> 01:04:17.007
Am I?

01:04:20.803 --> 01:04:21.470
<i>Welcome to OSCORP Industries</i>
<i>Unity Day Festival.</i>

01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:23.972
<i>Welcome to OSCORP Industries</i>
<i>Unity Day Festival.</i>

01:04:23.972 --> 01:04:24.973
<i>Let's hear it for Macy Gray.</i>

01:04:24.973 --> 01:04:25.474
<i>Let's hear it for Macy Gray.</i>

01:04:25.474 --> 01:04:26.016
<i>Let's hear it for Macy Gray.</i>

01:04:26.016 --> 01:04:27.726
<i>Let's hear it for Macy Gray.</i>

01:05:04.138 --> 01:05:07.683
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

01:05:08.726 --> 01:05:12.396
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

01:05:12.563 --> 01:05:17.109
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.

01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:20.028
I think you're beautiful.

01:05:32.833 --> 01:05:36.086
I forgot my drink inside.

01:05:46.305 --> 01:05:48.432
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.

01:05:49.516 --> 01:05:54.688
- Have you seen my father?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.203
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

01:06:14.083 --> 01:06:15.376
What is that?

01:06:15.542 --> 01:06:17.461
That's our glider!

01:06:27.846 --> 01:06:29.306
What the hell was that?

01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:59.128
Code three!

01:07:15.144 --> 01:07:17.312
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!

01:07:23.277 --> 01:07:26.739
Harry! Help me! Harry!

01:07:32.703 --> 01:07:34.455
Out, am I?

01:07:39.001 --> 01:07:42.212
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!

01:07:44.214 --> 01:07:46.091
Hello, my dear.

01:07:47.092 --> 01:07:48.927
It's Spider- Man!

01:08:00.439 --> 01:08:02.399
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!

01:08:05.903 --> 01:08:08.238
Somebody help him!

01:08:08.447 --> 01:08:10.491
No!

01:08:11.492 --> 01:08:13.035
Mommy!

01:08:15.037 --> 01:08:16.997
- Hold it!
- I surrender.

01:08:17.581 --> 01:08:20.084
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!

01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:27.131
Lmpressive.

01:08:51.407 --> 01:08:54.868
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!

01:09:20.227 --> 01:09:21.270
Hold on!

01:09:22.895 --> 01:09:23.939
Watch out!

01:09:33.073 --> 01:09:36.868
We'll meet again, Spider- Man!

01:10:22.373 --> 01:10:25.042
Well, beats taking the subway.

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:28.504
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:29.797
Wait.

01:10:29.963 --> 01:10:31.215
Who are you?

01:10:31.382 --> 01:10:33.967
- You know who I am.
- I do?

01:10:34.176 --> 01:10:36.804
Your friendly neighborhood Spider- Man.

01:10:48.524 --> 01:10:52.403
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:57.241
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'll come over.

01:10:57.908 --> 01:10:59.576
No, I'm gonna come...

01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:03.330
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

01:11:03.539 --> 01:11:06.500
And we'll go and have breakfast and...

01:11:06.667 --> 01:11:08.961
...I want to buy you something.

01:11:09.128 --> 01:11:12.464
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

01:11:13.507 --> 01:11:17.177
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

01:11:20.013 --> 01:11:22.391
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

01:11:22.558 --> 01:11:24.309
Don't let the bedbugs...

01:11:29.982 --> 01:11:33.026
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

01:11:34.737 --> 01:11:38.365
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.369
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

01:11:42.536 --> 01:11:45.581
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

01:11:46.665 --> 01:11:48.167
You're right.

01:11:49.084 --> 01:11:50.586
I didn't.

01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:57.009
I'm gonna get some rest.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.512
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

01:12:01.597 --> 01:12:03.348
What was that thing?

01:12:03.932 --> 01:12:05.267
I don't know.

01:12:06.685 --> 01:12:10.064
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

01:12:25.954 --> 01:12:27.456
Somebody there?

01:12:27.456 --> 01:12:28.248
<i>Somebody.</i>

01:12:28.248 --> 01:12:29.917
<i>Somebody.</i>

01:12:31.251 --> 01:12:32.795
Who said that?

01:12:33.462 --> 01:12:36.799
<i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>

01:12:39.259 --> 01:12:41.929
<i>You've known all along.</i>

01:12:45.933 --> 01:12:47.309
Where are you?

01:12:47.476 --> 01:12:51.522
<i>Follow the cold shiver</i>
<i>running down your spine.</i>

01:12:58.404 --> 01:13:00.239
<i>I'm right here.</i>

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:03.992
I don't understand.

01:13:04.993 --> 01:13:08.163
Did you think it was coincidence?

01:13:08.414 --> 01:13:11.959
So many good things,
all happening for you.

01:13:12.126 --> 01:13:15.796
All for you. Norman.

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.758
What do you want?

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.344
To say what you won't.

01:13:22.636 --> 01:13:25.180
To do what you can't.

01:13:25.347 --> 01:13:29.935
To remove those in your way.

01:13:33.897 --> 01:13:35.858
The board members.

01:13:37.151 --> 01:13:38.527
You killed them.

01:13:38.694 --> 01:13:40.237
We killed them.

01:13:40.571 --> 01:13:41.613
We?

01:13:41.822 --> 01:13:43.365
Remember?

01:13:43.532 --> 01:13:46.201
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

01:13:48.078 --> 01:13:49.872
The performance enhancers.

01:13:50.039 --> 01:13:55.335
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

01:13:55.544 --> 01:13:59.339
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

01:13:59.506 --> 01:14:02.384
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

01:14:02.551 --> 01:14:05.054
And it's only the beginning.

01:14:06.555 --> 01:14:10.893
There's only one who can stop us.

01:14:11.685 --> 01:14:15.064
Or imagine if he joined us.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:23.072
Spider- Man. And the Green Goblin.

01:14:23.322 --> 01:14:26.575
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

01:14:26.742 --> 01:14:29.745
- These weirdos all got to have a name.
- Mr. Jameson...

01:14:29.912 --> 01:14:31.580
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:36.543
Copyright "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.

01:14:36.752 --> 01:14:39.046
How about "Green Meanie"?

01:14:39.213 --> 01:14:42.091
Spider- Man wasn't attacking.
That's slander.

01:14:42.257 --> 01:14:44.593
It is not. I resent that.

01:14:44.843 --> 01:14:47.596
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

01:14:47.763 --> 01:14:49.431
You don't trust anybody.

01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:51.642
I trust my barber.

01:14:52.476 --> 01:14:53.977
Are you his lawyer?

01:14:54.186 --> 01:14:58.941
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...

01:15:06.448 --> 01:15:09.576
Jameson, you slime.

01:15:09.785 --> 01:15:13.080
Who takes the pictures of Spider- Man?

01:15:13.288 --> 01:15:16.208
- I don't know. His stuff comes by mail.
- Liar!

01:15:16.375 --> 01:15:19.378
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.

01:15:19.545 --> 01:15:22.464
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.

01:15:22.673 --> 01:15:24.925
Set him down, tough guy.

01:15:25.175 --> 01:15:29.763
- Speak of the devil.
- I knew you two were in this together!

01:15:29.972 --> 01:15:32.558
Kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute.

01:15:32.766 --> 01:15:35.227
Sleep...

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:53.704
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

01:15:53.871 --> 01:15:58.292
No, you're not dead yet.

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.669
Just paralyzed...

01:16:00.836 --> 01:16:02.796
...temporarily.

01:16:03.797 --> 01:16:06.884
You're an amazing creature,
Spider- Man.

01:16:07.092 --> 01:16:09.762
You and I are not so different.

01:16:10.471 --> 01:16:13.807
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

01:16:14.016 --> 01:16:16.894
Well, to each his own.

01:16:17.061 --> 01:16:20.022
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:25.319
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

01:16:25.527 --> 01:16:28.781
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

01:16:28.989 --> 01:16:32.576
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

01:16:32.743 --> 01:16:37.289
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

01:16:37.498 --> 01:16:38.540
Why bother?

01:16:38.749 --> 01:16:43.462
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

01:16:43.879 --> 01:16:46.882
There are eight million people
in this city.

01:16:47.091 --> 01:16:51.387
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

01:16:51.595 --> 01:16:55.557
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

01:16:55.724 --> 01:16:57.142
You, me...

01:16:57.726 --> 01:16:59.645
...we're exceptional.

01:16:59.895 --> 01:17:04.566
I could squash you like a bug
right now.

01:17:04.775 --> 01:17:08.445
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

01:17:08.612 --> 01:17:12.199
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

01:17:12.408 --> 01:17:15.160
What we could create.

01:17:15.744 --> 01:17:17.746
Or we could destroy.

01:17:17.913 --> 01:17:21.875
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

01:17:22.084 --> 01:17:26.964
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?

01:17:28.966 --> 01:17:31.844
Think about it, hero.

01:17:43.814 --> 01:17:49.153
<i>In spite of everything you've done for</i>
<i>them, eventually, they will hate you.</i>

01:17:59.496 --> 01:18:00.956
It's me again.

01:18:01.331 --> 01:18:02.750
How was your audition?

01:18:02.958 --> 01:18:05.961
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...

01:18:06.128 --> 01:18:08.088
...told my aunt, told me.

01:18:08.547 --> 01:18:09.882
So you just came by?

01:18:10.090 --> 01:18:13.719
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

01:18:13.886 --> 01:18:18.474
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

01:18:18.724 --> 01:18:20.225
So how'd it go?

01:18:22.394 --> 01:18:24.980
They said I needed acting lessons.

01:18:25.147 --> 01:18:28.901
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

01:18:29.068 --> 01:18:34.406
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

01:18:35.741 --> 01:18:37.826
I'd like a cheeseburger.

01:18:38.285 --> 01:18:41.747
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

01:18:42.164 --> 01:18:43.582
Come with us.

01:18:43.749 --> 01:18:46.502
No, thanks. How's it going with...?

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.923
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

01:18:51.423 --> 01:18:52.925
It's not?

01:18:54.343 --> 01:18:56.011
Why so interested?

01:18:56.678 --> 01:18:58.180
I'm not.

01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:59.807
You're not?

01:19:01.433 --> 01:19:04.186
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.

01:19:04.436 --> 01:19:06.230
Why would you be?

01:19:08.107 --> 01:19:10.442
I, that's a...

01:19:10.651 --> 01:19:12.152
I don't know.

01:19:14.363 --> 01:19:17.199
Sorry you won't come with us.

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.620
I'd better run, tiger.

01:19:30.337 --> 01:19:32.339
Hey, check it out, man.

01:19:32.506 --> 01:19:34.174
Come on, man.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.973
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

01:19:58.866 --> 01:20:00.325
Get off me!

01:20:33.609 --> 01:20:35.110
Wait!

01:20:39.948 --> 01:20:42.326
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

01:20:42.493 --> 01:20:46.872
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

01:20:47.081 --> 01:20:48.957
I was in the neighborhood.

01:20:50.834 --> 01:20:53.462
You are amazing.

01:20:54.421 --> 01:20:57.132
Some people don't think so.

01:20:58.217 --> 01:21:01.220
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.

01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:05.182
Do I get to say thank you this time?

01:21:06.058 --> 01:21:07.559
Wait.

01:22:16.545 --> 01:22:18.672
Let me in! My baby's in there!

01:22:18.839 --> 01:22:20.966
- Let me go!
- The roof's collapsing!

01:22:21.133 --> 01:22:24.636
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!

01:22:24.845 --> 01:22:26.180
Look! Up there!

01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:34.605
Save my baby, please!

01:22:58.337 --> 01:22:59.463
No!

01:23:07.221 --> 01:23:11.225
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!

01:23:12.267 --> 01:23:15.187
God bless you, Spider- Man.
Bless you.

01:23:15.396 --> 01:23:17.147
Don't let him get away!

01:23:17.356 --> 01:23:20.609
Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.

01:23:20.776 --> 01:23:24.113
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

01:23:25.572 --> 01:23:26.907
I'm going.

01:23:28.575 --> 01:23:31.620
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back.

01:23:32.037 --> 01:23:33.163
Go! Go!

01:23:42.089 --> 01:23:43.799
Where are you?

01:23:45.843 --> 01:23:47.428
Where are you?

01:23:52.808 --> 01:23:55.185
I'm gonna get you out of here!

01:23:57.771 --> 01:23:59.273
It's okay.

01:24:06.321 --> 01:24:08.907
You're pathetically predictable.

01:24:09.074 --> 01:24:10.993
Like a moth to the flame.

01:24:11.869 --> 01:24:14.329
What about my generous proposal?

01:24:15.372 --> 01:24:18.208
Are you in or are you out?

01:24:18.417 --> 01:24:24.339
- It's you who's out. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.

01:24:24.757 --> 01:24:26.258
Oh, great.

01:25:04.922 --> 01:25:07.716
No one says no to me!

01:25:15.057 --> 01:25:18.477
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

01:25:20.979 --> 01:25:22.231
He's here.

01:25:23.023 --> 01:25:24.525
Are you ready?

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.029
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

01:25:29.238 --> 01:25:32.324
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

01:25:32.533 --> 01:25:35.953
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

01:25:36.203 --> 01:25:38.914
Who is this lovely young lady?

01:25:39.081 --> 01:25:43.377
I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

01:25:43.585 --> 01:25:46.255
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

01:25:46.463 --> 01:25:50.175
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

01:25:50.342 --> 01:25:52.720
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.

01:25:58.475 --> 01:26:02.062
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

01:26:05.065 --> 01:26:06.567
Peter?

01:26:14.616 --> 01:26:16.326
Is that you?

01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:25.961
How strange. There's nobody here.

01:26:32.426 --> 01:26:36.889
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

01:27:09.505 --> 01:27:12.132
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!

01:27:12.299 --> 01:27:14.051
It's a jungle out there.

01:27:14.218 --> 01:27:18.138
Had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

01:27:18.597 --> 01:27:21.433
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.185
...and we can say grace.

01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:28.482
Here we go.

01:27:35.447 --> 01:27:37.783
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.

01:27:41.578 --> 01:27:43.872
Will you do the honors?

01:27:55.551 --> 01:27:58.804
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:06.979
I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

01:28:07.146 --> 01:28:08.689
Well, let me see.

01:28:08.897 --> 01:28:10.399
Oh, my goodness.

01:28:10.649 --> 01:28:13.068
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

01:28:13.235 --> 01:28:16.363
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

01:28:16.572 --> 01:28:21.869
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
here, and we'll do things properly.

01:28:22.828 --> 01:28:25.914
How did you say that happened?

01:28:26.331 --> 01:28:28.042
Bike messenger.

01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:30.210
Knocked me down.

01:28:35.591 --> 01:28:39.261
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
- Why?

01:28:40.179 --> 01:28:43.557
Something has come to my attention.

01:28:43.766 --> 01:28:45.017
Are you all right?

01:28:45.225 --> 01:28:48.729
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

01:28:49.354 --> 01:28:51.732
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!

01:28:53.901 --> 01:28:57.696
I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
and now you have to leave?

01:28:57.905 --> 01:28:59.573
I've got to go.

01:28:59.907 --> 01:29:04.036
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.

01:29:04.244 --> 01:29:08.207
Think she's sniffing around
because she likes your personality?

01:29:08.457 --> 01:29:11.460
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful.

01:29:11.627 --> 01:29:17.049
They're all beautiful until they're
snarling after your money like wolves.

01:29:17.257 --> 01:29:18.509
You're wrong, Dad.

01:29:19.051 --> 01:29:22.262
A word to the not-so-wise
about your girlfriend:

01:29:22.429 --> 01:29:26.308
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

01:29:36.693 --> 01:29:39.238
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

01:29:39.446 --> 01:29:42.408
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

01:29:42.616 --> 01:29:46.495
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.

01:29:46.745 --> 01:29:49.081
Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!

01:29:49.248 --> 01:29:50.916
Harry Osborn!

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.044
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

01:29:57.005 --> 01:30:00.342
<i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>

01:30:00.509 --> 01:30:03.637
<i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>

01:30:03.846 --> 01:30:05.180
I can't.

01:30:05.347 --> 01:30:08.350
<i>Betrayal must not be countenanced.</i>

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.853
<i>Parker must be educated.</i>

01:30:13.021 --> 01:30:14.314
What do I do?

01:30:14.523 --> 01:30:18.610
<i>Instruct him in the matters</i>
<i>of loss and pain.</i>

01:30:18.777 --> 01:30:21.822
<i>Make him suffer.</i>
<i>Make him wish he were dead.</i>

01:30:22.072 --> 01:30:23.365
Yes?

01:30:23.532 --> 01:30:25.451
<i>And then grant his wish.</i>

01:30:26.368 --> 01:30:27.661
But how?

01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:32.166
<i>The cunning warrior attacks</i>
<i>neither body nor mind.</i>

01:30:32.374 --> 01:30:33.542
Tell me how!

01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:35.878
<i>The heart, Osborn.</i>

01:30:36.128 --> 01:30:39.173
<i>First, we attack his heart.</i>

01:30:41.050 --> 01:30:44.553
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

01:30:44.762 --> 01:30:47.723
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:30:47.973 --> 01:30:51.810
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

01:30:59.568 --> 01:31:02.112
Deliver us!

01:31:02.321 --> 01:31:03.697
Finish it!

01:31:03.989 --> 01:31:07.910
- Finish it!
- From evil!

01:31:13.624 --> 01:31:15.793
Two milligrams IV.

01:31:17.586 --> 01:31:18.837
Get the BP.

01:31:19.254 --> 01:31:22.841
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

01:31:23.050 --> 01:31:24.385
You have to leave.

01:31:24.551 --> 01:31:26.261
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

01:31:26.428 --> 01:31:30.516
Those horrible yellow eyes!

01:31:35.354 --> 01:31:37.898
He knows who I am.

01:32:21.859 --> 01:32:23.444
I'm sorry.

01:32:27.156 --> 01:32:29.616
- Will she be okay?
- She'll be fine.

01:32:29.783 --> 01:32:32.453
She's been sleeping all day.

01:32:33.454 --> 01:32:36.206
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

01:32:40.377 --> 01:32:43.297
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

01:32:43.464 --> 01:32:47.176
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

01:32:47.384 --> 01:32:50.345
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

01:32:50.804 --> 01:32:52.973
I haven't called him back.

01:32:55.059 --> 01:32:56.769
The fact is...

01:32:57.936 --> 01:33:00.773
...l'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

01:33:00.939 --> 01:33:03.150
At least I think I am.

01:33:04.818 --> 01:33:07.863
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.

01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:11.283
Would I know his name, this guy?

01:33:11.492 --> 01:33:14.370
You'll think I'm a little girl
with a crush.

01:33:14.536 --> 01:33:15.913
Trust me.

01:33:16.163 --> 01:33:17.414
It's funny.

01:33:19.416 --> 01:33:23.379
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

01:33:23.545 --> 01:33:26.924
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.

01:33:27.132 --> 01:33:30.094
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

01:33:30.302 --> 01:33:34.598
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say?

01:33:34.765 --> 01:33:37.684
Not Spider- Man,
not a chance in the world.

01:33:37.893 --> 01:33:39.520
I know him a little bit.

01:33:39.728 --> 01:33:42.606
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

01:33:42.815 --> 01:33:45.943
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

01:33:46.276 --> 01:33:47.736
What'd he say?

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.655
I said...

01:33:50.739 --> 01:33:55.035
He asked me what I thought about you.

01:33:55.953 --> 01:33:57.996
And what did you say?

01:33:58.706 --> 01:34:02.793
I said, "Spider- Man."

01:34:03.127 --> 01:34:08.006
I said, "The great thing about M. J...

01:34:08.215 --> 01:34:09.758
...is...

01:34:10.676 --> 01:34:13.929
...when you look in her eyes...

01:34:16.473 --> 01:34:19.685
...and she's looking back in yours...

01:34:20.686 --> 01:34:23.689
...everything feels...

01:34:24.898 --> 01:34:26.734
...not quite normal.

01:34:27.985 --> 01:34:29.778
Because you feel...

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.947
...stronger...

01:34:33.490 --> 01:34:37.119
...and weaker at the same time.

01:34:38.162 --> 01:34:40.289
You feel excited...

01:34:41.165 --> 01:34:43.208
...and at the same time...

01:34:43.834 --> 01:34:45.461
...terrified.

01:34:47.796 --> 01:34:52.092
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:57.139
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

01:34:59.850 --> 01:35:01.727
It's as if you've...

01:35:02.352 --> 01:35:05.522
...reached the unreachable...

01:35:07.107 --> 01:35:09.818
...and you weren't ready for it."

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.032
You said that?

01:35:15.824 --> 01:35:18.160
Well, something like that.

01:36:02.454 --> 01:36:03.956
Dad?

01:36:09.294 --> 01:36:11.380
Dad, is that you?

01:36:17.970 --> 01:36:19.471
What is it?

01:36:21.724 --> 01:36:26.729
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

01:36:27.730 --> 01:36:30.441
She's in love with Peter.

01:36:30.733 --> 01:36:32.526
- Parker?
- Yeah.

01:36:32.693 --> 01:36:35.821
And how does he feel about her?

01:36:37.239 --> 01:36:39.783
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

01:36:40.743 --> 01:36:45.998
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

01:36:48.917 --> 01:36:50.669
I'm so sorry.

01:36:53.130 --> 01:36:56.592
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?

01:36:58.343 --> 01:37:01.555
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

01:37:01.722 --> 01:37:03.557
That's no excuse.

01:37:04.558 --> 01:37:06.351
I'm proud of you.

01:37:06.894 --> 01:37:11.774
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you.

01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:15.194
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

01:37:29.333 --> 01:37:31.126
<i>Wake up, little spider.</i>

01:37:31.293 --> 01:37:32.795
Wake up.

01:37:34.129 --> 01:37:35.714
Go home, dear.

01:37:35.923 --> 01:37:37.257
You look awful.

01:37:37.466 --> 01:37:39.760
- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:37:39.927 --> 01:37:43.263
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.

01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:46.141
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

01:37:46.308 --> 01:37:51.855
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

01:37:52.606 --> 01:37:54.358
A smile. Finally.

01:37:54.525 --> 01:37:58.862
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.

01:37:59.029 --> 01:38:01.323
You were supposed to be asleep.

01:38:02.157 --> 01:38:06.912
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

01:38:07.121 --> 01:38:11.125
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

01:38:11.333 --> 01:38:17.589
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, is that an angel?"

01:38:17.798 --> 01:38:21.343
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.

01:38:24.012 --> 01:38:26.765
Well, Harry's in love with her.

01:38:26.974 --> 01:38:30.728
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

01:38:30.936 --> 01:38:35.524
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

01:38:35.733 --> 01:38:38.861
You're so mysterious all the time.

01:38:39.111 --> 01:38:41.864
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

01:38:42.072 --> 01:38:46.035
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

01:38:46.493 --> 01:38:48.912
Everybody else knows.

01:38:51.832 --> 01:38:53.125
I'll be right back.

01:38:53.834 --> 01:38:55.127
But...

01:39:02.468 --> 01:39:04.470
Come on, pick up.

01:39:04.636 --> 01:39:07.931
- Hey M.J.
<i>- Hi. Sing your song at the beep.</i>

01:39:08.974 --> 01:39:11.018
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:14.146
Hello? You there?

01:39:14.646 --> 01:39:19.151
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

01:39:19.318 --> 01:39:20.736
All right, well...

01:39:21.153 --> 01:39:22.196
Don't...

01:39:22.988 --> 01:39:25.199
Don't go up any dark alleys.

01:39:25.407 --> 01:39:26.909
Hello?

01:39:29.328 --> 01:39:33.040
<i>Can Spider-Man come out to play?</i>

01:39:33.248 --> 01:39:35.000
Where is she?

01:40:21.255 --> 01:40:22.923
- What is that?
- That's cool!

01:40:23.132 --> 01:40:27.761
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i>
<i>Went up the water spout</i>

01:40:27.928 --> 01:40:32.099
<i>Down came the goblin</i>
<i>And took the spider out</i>

01:40:48.907 --> 01:40:50.659
Goblin, what have you done?

01:41:33.118 --> 01:41:36.997
Spider- Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.

01:41:37.373 --> 01:41:39.041
Because you never know...

01:41:39.208 --> 01:41:43.962
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

01:41:45.089 --> 01:41:47.716
Let die the woman you love...

01:41:52.012 --> 01:41:57.101
...or suffer the little children.

01:41:59.478 --> 01:42:01.980
- Spider- Man!
- Save us!

01:42:02.481 --> 01:42:04.775
Save us!

01:42:05.067 --> 01:42:07.653
Make your choice, Spider- Man...

01:42:07.861 --> 01:42:11.240
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

01:42:11.407 --> 01:42:13.492
Don't do it, Goblin!

01:42:13.659 --> 01:42:16.578
We are who we choose to be.

01:42:16.829 --> 01:42:19.581
- Now, choose!
- No!

01:42:48.277 --> 01:42:49.862
Everybody stay still!

01:42:59.371 --> 01:43:00.664
Ahoy up there!

01:43:00.831 --> 01:43:03.792
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:15.429
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

01:43:15.596 --> 01:43:17.097
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

01:43:22.186 --> 01:43:25.230
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

01:43:25.397 --> 01:43:26.982
Trust me.

01:43:28.484 --> 01:43:32.321
Hold on tight and go quickly.

01:43:36.658 --> 01:43:38.702
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.

01:43:38.911 --> 01:43:40.579
Hang on, Mary Jane!

01:44:09.024 --> 01:44:11.652
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

01:44:21.537 --> 01:44:24.748
It's time to die.

01:44:31.755 --> 01:44:35.592
- I got something for you!
- We ought to kick your ass!

01:44:35.759 --> 01:44:39.179
Leave Spider- Man alone!
You'd pick on a guy saving kids?

01:44:39.847 --> 01:44:43.350
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

01:44:43.517 --> 01:44:47.062
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

01:44:59.575 --> 01:45:01.368
Spider- Man, watch out!

01:45:33.233 --> 01:45:37.488
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

01:45:38.405 --> 01:45:41.033
I offered you friendship...

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:43.077
...and you spat in my face.

01:46:34.169 --> 01:46:37.840
You've spun your last web, Spider- Man.

01:46:38.006 --> 01:46:41.343
Had you not been so selfish,
your girlfriend's death...

01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:43.178
...would have been quick.

01:46:43.345 --> 01:46:46.765
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

01:46:47.015 --> 01:46:51.895
...l'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

01:46:56.483 --> 01:46:58.527
M.J. And I...

01:46:59.361 --> 01:47:02.656
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:58.003
Peter, stop!

01:47:58.170 --> 01:48:00.631
Stop! It's me.

01:48:09.598 --> 01:48:11.100
Mr. Osborn.

01:48:11.266 --> 01:48:12.810
Thank God for you.

01:48:13.018 --> 01:48:15.354
You killed those people
on that balcony.

01:48:15.521 --> 01:48:18.565
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

01:48:18.732 --> 01:48:20.484
Don't let him take me again.

01:48:20.651 --> 01:48:22.695
I beg you. Protect me.

01:48:22.861 --> 01:48:26.448
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

01:48:26.615 --> 01:48:28.117
But not you.

01:48:28.784 --> 01:48:32.746
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.

01:48:32.955 --> 01:48:35.040
I would never hurt you.

01:48:35.249 --> 01:48:37.167
I knew from the beginning...

01:48:37.376 --> 01:48:40.295
...if anything ever happened to me...

01:48:40.462 --> 01:48:42.589
...it was you I could count on.

01:48:42.756 --> 01:48:46.135
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

01:48:46.719 --> 01:48:48.554
Thank God for you.

01:48:49.555 --> 01:48:50.973
Give me your hand.

01:48:52.141 --> 01:48:55.561
Believe in me
as I believed in you.

01:48:56.979 --> 01:48:59.773
I've been like a father to you.

01:49:01.316 --> 01:49:02.985
Be a son to me now.

01:49:04.778 --> 01:49:06.655
I have a father.

01:49:07.406 --> 01:49:09.908
His name was Ben Parker.

01:49:11.785 --> 01:49:13.245
Godspeed, Spider- Man.

01:49:32.181 --> 01:49:33.682
Peter.

01:49:36.018 --> 01:49:37.853
Don't tell Harry.

01:50:09.551 --> 01:50:11.261
What have you done?

01:50:11.428 --> 01:50:13.013
What have you done?!

01:50:41.166 --> 01:50:43.210
I'm so sorry, Harry.

01:50:44.128 --> 01:50:47.256
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

01:50:49.425 --> 01:50:52.720
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

01:50:54.304 --> 01:50:56.598
One day Spider- Man will pay.

01:50:58.475 --> 01:51:01.603
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider- Man will pay.

01:51:06.608 --> 01:51:08.444
Thank God for you, Peter.

01:51:09.153 --> 01:51:11.613
You're the only family I have.

01:51:36.138 --> 01:51:38.432
<i>No matter what I do...</i>

01:51:38.599 --> 01:51:41.727
<i>... no matter how hard I try...</i>

01:51:42.311 --> 01:51:46.148
<i>... the ones I love will always</i>
<i>be the ones who pay.</i>

01:51:56.867 --> 01:51:59.203
You must miss him so much.

01:52:00.162 --> 01:52:03.207
It's been so hard without him.

01:52:06.126 --> 01:52:09.004
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

01:52:10.798 --> 01:52:12.591
When I was up there...

01:52:13.342 --> 01:52:16.136
...and I thought I was gonna die...

01:52:17.763 --> 01:52:21.600
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

01:52:22.893 --> 01:52:26.105
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

01:52:27.564 --> 01:52:29.983
It was you, Pete.

01:52:30.859 --> 01:52:32.736
I kept thinking:

01:52:33.153 --> 01:52:35.948
"I hope I make it through this...

01:52:37.408 --> 01:52:41.787
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

01:52:43.163 --> 01:52:44.665
Really?

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:50.838
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

01:52:52.089 --> 01:52:54.049
...who makes me feel...

01:52:54.508 --> 01:52:58.220
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

01:53:00.347 --> 01:53:02.015
That I'm just...

01:53:02.683 --> 01:53:04.184
...me.

01:53:05.269 --> 01:53:07.187
And that's okay.

01:53:09.398 --> 01:53:10.858
The truth is...

01:53:12.985 --> 01:53:14.778
...I love you.

01:53:16.905 --> 01:53:18.824
I love you so much, Peter.

01:53:39.553 --> 01:53:44.308
<i>All I wanted was to tell her</i>
<i>how much I loved her.</i>

01:53:44.475 --> 01:53:46.393
I can't...

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.064
You can't what?

01:53:51.190 --> 01:53:52.649
Tell you...

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:58.697
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

01:53:59.782 --> 01:54:03.702
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:06.580
I want you to know...

01:54:06.997 --> 01:54:09.666
...that I will always be there
for you.

01:54:09.875 --> 01:54:13.837
I will always be there
to take care of you.

01:54:14.838 --> 01:54:16.840
I promise you that.

01:54:20.135 --> 01:54:22.429
I will always be your friend.

01:54:25.349 --> 01:54:27.226
Only a friend...

01:54:28.102 --> 01:54:29.645
...Peter Parker?

01:54:31.814 --> 01:54:34.650
That's all I have to give.

01:55:01.009 --> 01:55:03.679
<i>Whatever life holds in store for me...</i>

01:55:03.846 --> 01:55:06.724
...I will never forget these words:

01:55:06.932 --> 01:55:11.979
<i>"With great power</i>
<i>comes great responsibility. "</i>

01:55:12.146 --> 01:55:14.398
<i>This is my gift.</i>

01:55:14.565 --> 01:55:16.692
<i>My curse.</i>

01:55:17.192 --> 01:55:19.111
<i>Who am I?</i>

01:55:19.486 --> 01:55:20.863
<i>I'm Spider-Man.</i>

01:55:21.305 --> 01:55:27.547
