WEBVTT

01:12.039 --> 01:13.172
- Oh God!

01:13.174 --> 01:14.773
Oh God, help me!

02:07.962 --> 02:08.860
Oh God!

02:08.863 --> 02:10.229
Oh God, help me!

03:54.535 --> 03:56.101
- Michael.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.472
Oh my gosh, we did it.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.406
- We did it.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.242
- This is the dream.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.176
- Yes.

04:04.178 --> 04:06.445
- It is!

04:06.447 --> 04:07.646
- Everything's
beautiful here.

04:07.648 --> 04:08.580
Look at this.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.382
It's literally like fake.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.283
You look beautiful.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.484
Isn't that crazy?

04:12.486 --> 04:15.520
- Oh my gosh,
it's so beautiful.

04:17.091 --> 04:17.956
Michael.

04:22.830 --> 04:26.665
- Hi, this is
Michael, leave a message.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.735
- Hey Michael,
it's Isabella.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.837
I just wanted to say hi.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.740
I know it's been
almost a year now

04:35.876 --> 04:38.677
since everything that
happened with Jess and

04:38.679 --> 04:41.079
I just want to see
how you're doing.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.181
I heard you're
dating someone new

04:43.183 --> 04:44.449
and I think that's great.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.818
I'd love to meet her.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.521
I'd also like to talk to
you because I think that

04:49.523 --> 04:52.491
I have a way that
maybe you and I

04:52.493 --> 04:54.660
can finally find some closure.

04:54.662 --> 04:59.564
So, let's try to meet up in
the city, maybe this Saturday?

05:02.236 --> 05:03.535
Let me know what you think.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.137
Talk to you soon.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.889
- Good evening, Mr. Swartz.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.324
This is my stunning wife.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.992
- Yep, see you right
here, RJ's VIPs.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.661
Thank you, have a good evening.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.231
- Michael, what's up, baby?

05:33.233 --> 05:34.466
Long time.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.034
- The renovations
look fantastic.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.303
- Yeah, it took us awhile
but we got it done.

05:38.305 --> 05:39.237
Carl.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.540
- Michael, nice to meet you.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.343
Shit, RJ.

05:44.345 --> 05:48.580
RJ, this is Kayla, Kayla this
is RJ, an old time friend.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.216
- Pleasure to met you.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.651
- This is so dope.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.120
- Dope, dope, dope, that's
exactly what we're looking for.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.288
You know what I'm saying?

05:56.290 --> 05:58.090
We have the dopest
booth in the whole club

05:58.092 --> 05:59.791
waiting on you guys
right in the back.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.828
- Yeah, let me show you the way.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.729
- Oh yeah.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.398
That's the temporary part.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.801
Renovations went a
little bit over budget.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.403
He's very temporary.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.605
You better go check your girl.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.806
- Good to see you.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.775
- Yeah, yeah, don't
lose sight of that dude.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.176
- Good evening.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.611
- Guests on RJ's list.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.946
Mike, Vinny and Tony.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.048
- Check the VIP for us, please?

06:25.085 --> 06:27.652
- RJ, do you know
somebody named Ty?

06:27.654 --> 06:30.021
- If he's not on the
list he can't get in.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.023
- Hey, paisano.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.125
- Carl.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.025
- Hey.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.193
- My man.
- What's up, Ty?

06:35.195 --> 06:36.294
- Place looks--

06:36.296 --> 06:37.629
- Don't say dope.
- What?

06:37.631 --> 06:40.465
- Just don't say dope,
what's the occasion?

06:40.467 --> 06:42.334
- I don't know, Michael
said he wanted to go out.

06:42.336 --> 06:43.668
Said he had something
important to run by me.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.237
- He's got a booth in the back.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.171
- Who's he with?

06:46.173 --> 06:48.206
- His new chick, Isabella,

06:48.208 --> 06:51.676
some hippy-looking girl and
some weird-looking dude.

06:51.678 --> 06:52.711
- Isabella?

06:52.713 --> 06:53.645
What's she doing here?

06:53.647 --> 06:54.880
- How the fuck should I know?

06:54.882 --> 06:55.781
- Well.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.722
- Ty's here.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.623
Hi, honey.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.359
- Glad you could make it.

07:07.361 --> 07:09.327
- For sure, bro.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.862
Good to see you.
- You too.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.097
- Gia, hey babe.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.165
- Hi, Tyler.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.368
- Is.

07:16.370 --> 07:20.238
I like the bullseye
right between your tits.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.740
- Fuck you, Tyler.

07:23.710 --> 07:24.876
- Begory.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.211
- What?

07:26.213 --> 07:27.446
- Begory.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.815
- Yeah, we all heard you, bro.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.083
- My name is Begory.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.318
You greeted everybody else,

07:33.320 --> 07:36.188
so I figured I'd
introduce myself.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.390
- Right.

07:38.392 --> 07:40.292
Sorry, how rude of me.

07:41.094 --> 07:41.993
Tyler.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.495
Nice to meet you.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.270
- Well, I think I'm
ready for another drink.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.539
Would anyone else like to
join me up at that bar?

07:54.541 --> 07:55.507
- Fuck yeah.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.142
Let's get this party started.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.945
- Okay, I was not
talking to you.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.640
- Oh no, man, I'm good.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.908
- Fuck that.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.443
We haven't been out
together in forever.

08:31.445 --> 08:32.744
- Should we even be in here?

08:32.746 --> 08:34.044
RJ's an ex-cop.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.514
- I come back here all the time.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.782
Don't worry about it.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.551
- I shouldn't.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.686
I don't wanna get too
fucked up in front of Kayla.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.421
- Don't be a bitch.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.657
You've known her for
like three months.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.658
- Yep.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.026
And things are going well.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.227
I don't wanna fuck it up.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.495
- What about Is?

08:50.497 --> 08:51.897
- What about Is?

08:51.899 --> 08:53.999
- Your girlfriend
doesn't mind, you know,

08:54.001 --> 08:55.233
that you're hanging out with--

08:55.235 --> 08:57.302
- My missing wife's sister?

08:57.304 --> 08:58.937
- Okay, yeah, that.

08:59.806 --> 09:00.972
- Kayla's cool.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.707
She understands.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.509
That's why we're
all here tonight.

09:04.511 --> 09:07.178
You of all people know
that I had a hard time

09:07.180 --> 09:10.916
with Jessica's disappearance
but I'm better now.

09:10.918 --> 09:11.816
- Yeah.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.120
- Isabella hasn't
had such an easy time

09:15.122 --> 09:17.322
trying to close that door.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.724
That's where Gianna
and Begory come in.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.059
- Who?

09:21.061 --> 09:21.927
- Begory.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.897
- The guy with two
different eyes and the scar?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.132
What the fuck is
that guy's deal?

09:27.134 --> 09:28.733
- Why are you giving
him such a hard time?

09:28.735 --> 09:31.236
Listen, Isabella thinks this
will help her find closure

09:31.238 --> 09:35.240
and, quite frankly, it
won't hurt me either.

09:35.242 --> 09:39.010
- So what's that got to do
with "Big Gary" and Gia?

09:39.012 --> 09:39.911
- Begory.

09:40.747 --> 09:41.846
- Whatever.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.649
- What the fuck?!

09:44.651 --> 09:46.051
Busted, motherfuckers!

09:46.053 --> 09:47.052
- RJ, I'm sorry, man.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.787
- Are you fucking kidding me?!

09:48.789 --> 09:51.089
Girls sitting there smell
weed coming from back here

09:51.091 --> 09:53.491
and it's you motherfuckers,
are you serious, man?

09:53.493 --> 09:54.426
- Sorry.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.660
- This a good idea to you?

09:55.662 --> 09:56.828
Fucking disrespectful!

09:56.830 --> 09:57.862
You think that's okay?

09:57.864 --> 09:59.097
- No, RJ, my bad.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.400
- You said you come
in here all the time.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.338
- I love scaring white boys.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.308
It's cool with me.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.677
Don't let Carl bust you, okay?

10:12.679 --> 10:15.246
He's got a lot of money
invested in this club.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.682
They won't think
it's funny, okay?

10:17.684 --> 10:18.583
- Yeah.

10:26.393 --> 10:29.794
- So just a fireman
husband, that's it?

10:29.796 --> 10:32.597
- Well, that and I also
want a princess wedding.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.232
- Of course you do.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.671
Have you talked to
Michael about any of this?

10:39.673 --> 10:42.607
- I've always known that
I'd be with a fireman.

10:42.609 --> 10:45.310
They're just so hot and manly.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.512
- And what about a career?

10:47.514 --> 10:49.514
Do you have any thoughts about

10:49.516 --> 10:51.349
something like
that for yourself?

10:51.351 --> 10:53.418
- Well, I do some work
for Victoria Secret

10:53.420 --> 10:55.520
and Michael's about to
go back to, you know,

10:55.522 --> 10:57.122
being a fireman.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.823
- So, you're a model.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.892
- Most people do
think I'm a model

11:00.894 --> 11:05.397
but, for now, I just work
part-time at the mall.

11:05.399 --> 11:06.431
- I'm sorry.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.769
So you work at a
Victoria Secret.

11:10.771 --> 11:14.205
You just said "you do some
work" for Victoria Secret.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.473
So I thought.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.776
- Well, I could do the
whole modeling thing

11:17.778 --> 11:22.514
but I don't wanna take any
time away from my family.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.984
- Family is important,
I will give you that.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.819
Do you come from a big family?

11:27.821 --> 11:29.387
- What? No.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.356
My parents said that
one of me is enough.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.426
I mean, why try and
top this, right?

11:35.595 --> 11:36.494
- Right.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.531
I mean, you did just say you

11:39.533 --> 11:41.099
didn't wanna take
time away from family,

11:41.101 --> 11:42.834
so I thought maybe you had.

11:42.836 --> 11:47.806
- Oh, for when Michael and
I get married and have kids.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.541
Two girls and two boys.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.576
Michael Junior, of course.

11:51.578 --> 11:52.677
The white picket fence.

11:52.679 --> 11:55.413
- I'm gonna be out by the table.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.389
- Compliments of the house.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.492
- The house special,
Sledgehammers and Roar.

12:07.494 --> 12:08.693
- I love Roar.

12:09.796 --> 12:12.797
- Why does everybody
look so serious?

12:12.799 --> 12:14.365
- You guys know that
Jess went missing

12:14.367 --> 12:16.401
on Clinton Road, right?

12:16.403 --> 12:18.803
- Wait a minute, you guys
come here to have a good time

12:18.805 --> 12:21.039
and that's the
topic of discussion?

12:21.041 --> 12:23.842
- Well, this guy is clairvoyant

12:23.844 --> 12:27.812
and he's gonna take Mike and
Is out there to talk to Jess,

12:27.814 --> 12:28.646
find out what happened.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.081
- Fuck that, man!

12:30.083 --> 12:31.883
That place is dark, man.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.419
Everybody knows that
place is haunted.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.121
- Isn't it just a
bunch of urban legends?

12:36.123 --> 12:37.655
- Says who, you?

12:37.657 --> 12:38.823
My aunt had a house near there,

12:38.825 --> 12:40.792
I know a lot about that place.

12:40.794 --> 12:41.993
- Wait, you've been there?

12:41.995 --> 12:43.294
- Been there?

12:43.296 --> 12:45.897
Had a fucking
experience on that road.

12:45.899 --> 12:50.502
Listen, one night I'm driving,
I'm by myself, it's dark.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.570
Driving down the
road about two miles

12:52.572 --> 12:54.939
and I see this lady
standing in the road.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.508
She's got her thumb out.

12:56.510 --> 12:59.511
So, me, I'm a nice guy, I
decide I'm gonna pick her up.

12:59.513 --> 13:03.314
She gets in the car, she
doesn't say one single word.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.250
So we drive about three miles

13:05.252 --> 13:06.851
and she says she
wants to get out.

13:06.853 --> 13:10.388
So I stop the car,
I let her out.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.625
She walks right
off into the woods.

13:13.627 --> 13:14.826
Now that's not my problem,

13:14.828 --> 13:16.461
I'm not gonna go
after her or anything

13:16.463 --> 13:19.764
but let me tell you, when
she got out of that car,

13:19.766 --> 13:23.568
the hair was standing up
on the back of my neck.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.570
- Big deal, a hitchhiker.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.006
- No, no, no, it
doesn't stop there.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.843
I drive about two more miles
and I see the same lady

13:31.845 --> 13:35.513
standing on the road
with her thumb out.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.447
And it gets worse from there.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.416
I'm nervous so I punch out.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.884
And the next thing you know,

13:39.886 --> 13:43.621
I'm back on the same road
where I first started.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.690
Like some time-shift shit.

13:45.692 --> 13:49.194
Like, I'm back, like I'm going
in fucking circles and shit.

13:49.196 --> 13:52.363
Fuck that place, man, that shit
is dark, that place is evil.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.765
Do not go there.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.201
- Evil?

13:56.203 --> 13:59.404
Come on, RJ, you don't
actually believe in that shit.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.072
- Listen, man,

14:01.074 --> 14:04.342
haven't you ever felt
somebody was watching you?

14:04.344 --> 14:06.444
Like they was standing over you.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.146
I mean, so close

14:08.148 --> 14:12.951
you could feel their breath
on the back of your neck

14:12.953 --> 14:16.855
and then when you look
around, nobody's there.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.591
- Hey.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.359
- What the fuck are
you doing, man?!

14:21.361 --> 14:23.294
What is so important you
gotta talk to me right now?!

14:23.296 --> 14:24.629
Are you crazy?!

14:24.631 --> 14:25.697
- You know, fuck this!

14:25.699 --> 14:27.432
You tell him.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.133
- Boss, the table in the back,

14:29.135 --> 14:30.935
they don't wanna pay the check.

14:30.937 --> 14:31.903
- Do you wanna die?
- No.

14:31.905 --> 14:32.971
- Walk away.

14:36.977 --> 14:37.842
- Going to Clinton Road.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.077
- Yes.

14:39.079 --> 14:39.978
- Cheers.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.031
- So let me get this straight.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.568
You're some spiritual
medium from Ohio

15:03.570 --> 15:05.270
and you're gonna talk to Jess

15:05.272 --> 15:07.739
using this hocus pocus
stuff in the woods

15:07.741 --> 15:10.341
off of some haunted
road in Jersey

15:10.343 --> 15:11.843
and find out what
happened to her?

15:11.845 --> 15:15.079
- Not to be condescending
but in layman's terms, yes.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.482
- Michael,
you're okay with this?

15:17.484 --> 15:18.683
- Yeah.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.184
If it'll help Isabella
and I move forward

15:20.186 --> 15:21.986
then what can it hurt?

15:21.988 --> 15:24.422
- Nobody asked your
opinion, Tyler.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.557
- No but Michael's my friend

15:26.559 --> 15:28.593
and I have a right to look
out for his best interests.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.827
- Tyler, you only
think it's stupid

15:29.829 --> 15:31.529
because you don't understand it.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.065
- No, I think it's stupid
because I think you

15:34.067 --> 15:36.000
and your new boyfriend here

15:36.002 --> 15:39.237
are trying to con my
boy out of some money.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.105
Or are you telling me your
boyfriend's doing this

15:41.107 --> 15:43.341
out of the kindness
of his heart?

15:43.343 --> 15:45.276
- Well, it's typical
for someone to get paid

15:45.278 --> 15:47.345
for services such as these.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.546
- Right.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.683
Oh and now it all becomes clear.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.818
- You know what, Tyler, none
of this is your business anyway

15:53.820 --> 15:57.322
but Michael's not paying
for anything, okay, I am

15:57.324 --> 15:59.857
and I invited him to come
with me because we might

15:59.859 --> 16:03.194
finally find out what
happened to my sister.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.597
Do you get off on
being a arrogant fuck?

16:07.567 --> 16:08.466
Move!

16:09.736 --> 16:11.636
- You're just a
skeptical asshole, Tyler.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.105
- And you're just some
crazy hippy wannabe

16:14.107 --> 16:16.507
that's pimping out your
new boyfriend for a buck.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.842
- Fuck you.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.716
- Guys, we're here to have fun.

16:28.054 --> 16:28.953
Just fun.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.595
- RJ, they made it here.

16:37.597 --> 16:41.733
- Hey, RJ, not fucking
bad for an ex-cop.

16:41.735 --> 16:43.468
- Congratulations, Mister Mayor.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.036
- Thank you very much.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.371
- Who the fuck are
you looking at?

16:46.373 --> 16:47.472
- Nobody important.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.406
- Yeah?

16:48.408 --> 16:50.041
- Hey, hey, calm down, dickhead,

16:50.043 --> 16:52.043
we're here to have a fucking
good time, all right?

16:52.045 --> 16:53.311
- Enjoy yourself, come on.
- Thank you.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.114
- Yeah, you're
lucky you got elected.

16:56.116 --> 16:59.317
- Take it easy,
he's the mayor now.

17:08.627 --> 17:11.162
- That shit's all in his head.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.964
- Makes my heard
heavy to see somebody

17:12.965 --> 17:15.800
that doesn't understand
the energies of the earth.

17:15.801 --> 17:18.403
- Listen, Begory, don't spit
your spiritual shit out--

17:18.405 --> 17:20.070
- I'm not finished.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.642
This process requires
faith and focus.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.512
Neither of which you have.

17:27.513 --> 17:28.679
With you coming along,

17:28.681 --> 17:32.183
it jeopardizes all
that for everyone else.

17:34.687 --> 17:35.553
- You done?

17:35.555 --> 17:36.821
- You know I am.

17:36.823 --> 17:37.855
- Good.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.624
And all I have to say is that

17:39.626 --> 17:41.592
I don't want my friend
getting his hopes up

17:41.594 --> 17:43.127
and be disappointed.

17:43.129 --> 17:44.796
He's already been through a lot

17:44.798 --> 17:46.798
and it's my responsibility
to make sure

17:46.800 --> 17:49.600
he doesn't get fucked over.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.135
- Good luck.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.006
- Luck?

17:55.008 --> 17:56.407
- Yeah,

17:56.409 --> 17:57.308
luck.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.882
- Hey, guys, Begory and I
are gonna get out of here.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.584
- Cool, we're right behind you

18:06.586 --> 18:08.052
once we just pick up the bill.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.654
- You don't have to get the
whole thing by yourself.

18:09.656 --> 18:10.688
Let me chip in.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.490
- No, no, no, I got it.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.892
- Well, at least let me tip.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.128
- Thanks, Gia.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.196
- Of course.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.431
I'm gonna talk to Is later

18:20.433 --> 18:21.666
and she's gonna fill
you in on everything.

18:21.668 --> 18:22.800
- Okay.

18:22.802 --> 18:23.701
- Bye.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.971
Oh God, what the hell?!

18:29.142 --> 18:30.241
- Are you okay?

18:30.243 --> 18:31.175
- Oh shit, that hurt.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.177
- I'm so sorry, honey.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.779
- It's actually not that bad.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.681
No, it's not that bad.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.056
You're gonna need some more
drinks before we go anywhere.

18:45.058 --> 18:45.957
Yeah.

18:48.061 --> 18:49.260
- Hi, good evening.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.428
- Dolores.

18:50.430 --> 18:54.398
- Yes,
RJ's waiting for you.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.967
Have a great time.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.370
- Eric Roberts, I'm on the list.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.273
- You're not
Eric Roberts, I know Eric.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.009
He's handsome and he's taller.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.477
And he's younger.

19:07.780 --> 19:08.613
- Wow.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.148
- Yeah, sorry.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.048
- I guess.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.185
- May I see?

19:16.055 --> 19:18.956
Oh, Mr. Roberts, I'm so
sorry, I didn't even realize.

19:18.958 --> 19:19.891
- What's your name?

19:19.893 --> 19:21.526
- Shiane.
- Call me Eric.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.560
- I'm so sorry.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.028
- It's all right.

19:24.030 --> 19:27.798
- I apologize, Mr. Roberts,
please take care of him.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.669
- Why don't you keep this on
your ear until you get home?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.437
- Can't I say with
you tonight, baby?

19:33.439 --> 19:34.572
- Of course.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.707
Let me just get us a cab.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.980
- Are you okay?

19:45.952 --> 19:46.784
- Yeah.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.619
Yeah, no, I'm good.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.354
Let's just get home.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.267
I got you some water.

20:03.269 --> 20:04.135
- Thanks, babe.

20:04.137 --> 20:05.203
- Of course.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.073
How're you feeling?

20:09.075 --> 20:09.974
- Okay.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.412
- Actually doesn't
look that bad.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.313
- Really?

20:18.985 --> 20:20.518
- If you're okay, I'm gonna
get a little work done

20:20.520 --> 20:22.587
at the desk before we go to bed.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.323
- Okay, I'm gonna grab a shower.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.152
Hey, babe.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.053
- Jesus.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.725
Babe, I thought you
were taking a shower.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.394
- I was thinking that I
wasn't quite ready enough

21:03.396 --> 21:05.696
to take a shower just yet.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.998
- I was just...

21:26.619 --> 21:28.185
- Baby?

21:28.187 --> 21:29.353
- Yeah, babe?

21:30.857 --> 21:33.291
- I changed my mind.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.258
- Now what?

21:35.862 --> 21:37.995
- I wanna come with you
when you go with Isabella

21:37.997 --> 21:39.397
to talk to Jess.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.100
- Why?

21:43.102 --> 21:45.202
- Because you're my man.

21:45.204 --> 21:48.039
This is important to you.

21:48.041 --> 21:48.539
I love you.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.278
- I love you too, babe.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.280
Of course you can come.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.455
This is it.

22:38.491 --> 22:41.092
This is the last
place anyone saw Jess.

22:41.094 --> 22:44.061
- I love getting out of
the city, it's so freeing.

22:44.063 --> 22:47.031
- Yeah, the great outdoors.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.600
- All right, so what
happens now, Gia?

22:49.602 --> 22:51.936
- Now we find Begory.

22:51.938 --> 22:52.837
- Okay.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.642
- Well, I hope you didn't
pay this ghost whisperer

22:58.644 --> 23:00.544
because it looks
like he's a no-show.

23:00.546 --> 23:03.848
- Knowing him, he
probably walked here.

23:06.219 --> 23:10.955
- Actually, he's right there,
leaning up against a tree.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.160
- Is he talking to that tree?

23:16.162 --> 23:18.529
- Didn't think we came
out here to talk to trees.

23:18.531 --> 23:21.365
- Right?

23:24.737 --> 23:26.237
- Gia.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.739
I wanna say thank you for
setting this whole thing up.

23:28.741 --> 23:29.907
I really appreciate it.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.909
- Oh, girl, anything for you.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.811
Well, that and I love watching
him to his voodoo shit,

23:33.813 --> 23:35.146
it's so hot.

23:35.148 --> 23:36.380
- What?

23:36.382 --> 23:38.048
- He gets so
serious and sweaty.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.084
- Please tell me this
isn't gonna turn into some

23:40.086 --> 23:41.852
weird drug-induced
love in thing.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.622
- No, babe, he's a
legit witch doctor.

23:44.624 --> 23:45.990
I wouldn't do this if I wasn't

23:45.992 --> 23:48.125
like 60 percent
sure he could do it.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.127
I mean, we might go
fuck in the woods after

23:50.129 --> 23:52.863
but it's all business first.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.032
- That's very reassuring.

24:22.128 --> 24:25.696
You actually have done this
with him before, right, Gia?

24:25.698 --> 24:27.031
- You mean contact a spirit?

24:27.033 --> 24:28.232
- Yeah.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.100
- Yeah, we contacted
my dead granny.

24:30.102 --> 24:31.769
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.137
It was amazing.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.206
- How did you know
it was actually her?

24:35.208 --> 24:37.641
- It was her, trust me.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.310
He's amazing, okay?

24:40.880 --> 24:42.112
It'll be good.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.073
- Here.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.211
- Really?

25:14.213 --> 25:15.212
Right here?

25:16.916 --> 25:18.415
- Fire goes here.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.719
- Isn't a fire gonna
piss off all these tree?

25:25.458 --> 25:27.858
- Oh come on, babe, I'm sorry
but that was funny as shit.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.126
- You know what,

25:29.128 --> 25:30.828
this is actually sort of
serious for some of us,

25:30.830 --> 25:32.596
so if you two are
gonna keep making jokes

25:32.598 --> 25:34.532
and fucking around then
why don't you just go

25:34.534 --> 25:36.467
sit in the truck together?

25:36.469 --> 25:38.769
- I thought it was a
pretty legitimate question.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.170
- It's not.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.907
- All right, fine, I'll shut up.

25:44.443 --> 25:46.010
- Shit.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.711
- What's wrong?

25:47.713 --> 25:49.146
- My phone.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.148
I think I left it in the car.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.117
Babe, can you go get it for me?

25:53.119 --> 25:54.251
- Yeah, sure.

25:55.988 --> 25:56.887
Keys.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.333
"Babe, will you get my phone?"

26:09.335 --> 26:10.234
Sure.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.747
Holy shit, you scared
the fuck out of me!

26:23.749 --> 26:26.050
- That wasn't my intention.

26:29.622 --> 26:30.554
- How may I help you?

26:30.556 --> 26:32.022
Are we okay to park here?

26:32.024 --> 26:35.759
- There's absolutely no
camping in this area.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.461
- That's good.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.029
We're not camping.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.764
- No fires.

26:40.766 --> 26:41.932
- Understood.

26:43.402 --> 26:47.271
- Most importantly,
stick to the road.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.772
- Yeah.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.642
Yeah, it's just me and some
friends, you know, hiking.

26:51.644 --> 26:53.444
No camping, no fires.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.981
- Stick to the road.

26:56.983 --> 26:57.948
- The road?

27:05.591 --> 27:06.824
What the fuck?

27:21.240 --> 27:22.106
Keys.

27:30.616 --> 27:33.350
- Not the best time for selfies.

27:34.387 --> 27:36.286
- Yeah, babe, come on.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.222
- Whatever.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.691
There's no reception
here anyway.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.847
- Is this normal, Gia?

28:46.192 --> 28:48.325
- Gianna, is this normal?

28:49.628 --> 28:51.028
Gianna?
- Huh?

28:51.030 --> 28:52.930
- Is he okay,
should we do something?

28:52.932 --> 28:54.264
- I don't know.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.238
- What's he saying?

29:01.240 --> 29:03.040
- Sounds like French.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.610
- I don't speak French.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.155
- Baby, are you okay?

29:20.126 --> 29:21.024
Baby?

29:22.328 --> 29:24.628
- If I had a signal we
could use Google Translate.

29:24.630 --> 29:26.563
Hashtag, "fucked up
shit in the woods."

29:26.565 --> 29:29.466
- Kayla, what the
hell, seriously?

29:29.468 --> 29:33.704
Put your goddamn phone
away and show some respect.

29:39.011 --> 29:39.910
Kayla.

29:41.046 --> 29:42.513
I'm sorry.

29:42.515 --> 29:43.413
Kayla.

29:44.984 --> 29:47.484
You can't just go walking off.

29:47.486 --> 29:48.952
- Stay here, bro.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.622
Take care of this shit.

29:51.624 --> 29:52.923
Kayla, hold up!

29:54.927 --> 29:55.826
- Damn it.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.130
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.398
- Michael, we don't
know that, okay?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.267
We need to be patient.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.201
All right?

30:04.203 --> 30:06.503
Maybe something is gonna happen.

30:11.243 --> 30:12.476
- I gotta get some air.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.377
- Michael.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.113
Michael, come on.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.149
Gia, you got this?

30:19.151 --> 30:20.284
- I'm good, girl.

30:20.286 --> 30:21.185
- Michael.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.422
- Kayla, be careful.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.723
Kayla, hold on!

30:27.760 --> 30:29.193
Just relax.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.127
He didn't mean that.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.662
- Yeah, he did.

30:31.664 --> 30:33.564
Such an asshole sometimes.

30:33.566 --> 30:36.366
- No, he's really
stressed right now.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.869
- Oh yeah, well I came all
the way out here for him

30:38.871 --> 30:40.671
so he should be showing a
little more appreciation,

30:40.673 --> 30:41.505
don't you think?

30:41.507 --> 30:42.806
- Yes, I agree.

30:43.876 --> 30:44.942
Listen, I've got a
lot of respect for you

30:44.944 --> 30:47.344
coming all the way out here.

30:48.581 --> 30:50.347
- You're so nice.

30:50.349 --> 30:53.584
Michael's lucky to
have a friend like you.

30:53.586 --> 30:57.821
- Any friend of Michael's
is a friend of mine too.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.916
- I have something to admit.

31:25.918 --> 31:27.150
- What's that?

31:28.587 --> 31:31.154
- I didn't come out
here to support Michael

31:31.156 --> 31:33.657
and search for his missing wife.

31:33.659 --> 31:34.825
- No?

31:34.827 --> 31:36.126
Why'd you come?

31:37.396 --> 31:38.962
- Selfish reasons.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.433
- There's nothing I can
think of less selfish

31:43.435 --> 31:46.303
than helping someone
find closure.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.305
- Yeah, it's that but--

31:49.808 --> 31:50.807
- But what?

31:52.511 --> 31:55.512
- It's nothing, I'm
just being stupid.

31:55.514 --> 31:56.413
- Come on.

32:00.519 --> 32:01.752
- I thought...

32:02.721 --> 32:03.587
What if...

32:08.727 --> 32:10.494
What if he found her?

32:11.430 --> 32:13.430
- She's been missing awhile.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.666
If she hasn't turned up by now,

32:15.668 --> 32:18.435
I really don't think
she's going to.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.303
- Okay.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.439
What about Isabella?

32:22.441 --> 32:24.007
- Is?

32:24.009 --> 32:25.542
What about her?

32:25.544 --> 32:27.244
- I don't know.

32:27.246 --> 32:28.578
They're close.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.213
- Really?

32:30.215 --> 32:32.182
You think Michael came
all the way out here

32:32.184 --> 32:34.918
to hook up with his
missing wife or her sister?

32:34.920 --> 32:37.821
- It's stupid and
selfish, I told you.

32:37.823 --> 32:40.724
- Look, Michael likes you.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.060
He's with you and he's loyal.

32:43.062 --> 32:46.163
You have nothing to worry about.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.064
- Thanks.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.533
That means a lot.

32:55.708 --> 32:57.240
- Am I totally insane
for bring us out

32:57.242 --> 32:59.843
into the middle of
the woods for this?

32:59.845 --> 33:00.744
- No.

33:02.915 --> 33:05.248
It's a beautiful sentiment.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.526
I'm not sure that Begory is
the right man for the job.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.061
- Are you shitting me?

33:18.063 --> 33:19.363
We have a dude back there who
is convulsing on the ground

33:19.365 --> 33:20.530
and speaking in tongues.

33:20.532 --> 33:21.832
Do you know of a
better guy for the job?

33:26.705 --> 33:29.706
- Feels good to laugh with you.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.742
- I'm glad you're still
in my life, Michael.

33:31.744 --> 33:35.078
You are still an
awesome brother-in-law.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.547
- And you're a neurotic
workaholic with crazy ideas.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.116
- Okay, you can just--

33:41.086 --> 33:42.786
- Did you hear that?

33:42.788 --> 33:44.688
- Yeah, what was that?

34:20.793 --> 34:21.591
Wow.

34:25.330 --> 34:26.996
- Looks like an old fireplace.

34:26.998 --> 34:29.232
- It's actually a foundry.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.773
- Like for a smith?

34:36.775 --> 34:38.041
- Yeah, I mean I guess so

34:38.043 --> 34:39.141
but it doesn't look
like it's been used

34:39.143 --> 34:41.777
in like a hundred or 200 years.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.221
Okay, I am ready to
get back now, Michael.

34:51.223 --> 34:54.257
- Yeah, I'm one
step ahead of you.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.321
- I saw a mechanic.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.624
His daughter.

36:02.161 --> 36:04.361
This iron worker.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.196
A boy in the water.

36:06.198 --> 36:09.099
- What're you
talking about, baby?

36:10.135 --> 36:11.568
- The purest evil

36:11.570 --> 36:15.105
and those who were wrongfully
killed and then tricked.

36:15.107 --> 36:16.573
They were tricked, these people,

36:16.575 --> 36:18.208
they were tricked into thinking

36:18.210 --> 36:20.110
that the only way they'd
be able to pass on

36:20.112 --> 36:22.078
by collecting the
souls of the damned.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.781
- You're not making any sense.

36:24.783 --> 36:25.849
- Fuck!

36:25.851 --> 36:28.418
This place is fucking so evil!

36:29.555 --> 36:31.488
They're not gonna
let us leave here.

36:31.490 --> 36:32.956
We gotta get out.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.224
- Then let's go, let's
get the fuck out of here.

36:34.226 --> 36:35.592
I just wanna go, I
just wanna leave,

36:35.594 --> 36:36.793
I wanna get the
fuck out of here!

36:36.795 --> 36:38.128
- We can't go yet.

36:38.130 --> 36:39.996
Were the fuck is my satchel?

36:45.037 --> 36:47.604
- What the fuck is that?

36:47.606 --> 36:49.139
- What?

36:49.141 --> 36:51.308
- I don't know, it's like
something dropping into the water.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.210
You don't hear that?

36:54.513 --> 36:56.713
Yeah, did you just see that?

36:56.715 --> 36:57.948
It's like a little
pebble or something

36:57.950 --> 37:00.483
falling off the bridge.

37:00.485 --> 37:03.386
- Maybe someone's
fishing from the bridge.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.955
- I don't know.

37:04.957 --> 37:07.023
Let's go check that out.

37:15.234 --> 37:18.468
- Are you sure
this is the way that we came?

37:18.470 --> 37:19.736
- I thought so.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.972
It's just dark,
it's hard to tell.

37:21.974 --> 37:24.808
- It feels like
we've been walking far enough

37:24.810 --> 37:26.843
we should be back already.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.578
- Totally.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.849
I just can't see anything,
we must've got turned around.

37:32.851 --> 37:35.118
- Let's just make sure
we're going the right way.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.155
And not that way.

37:39.157 --> 37:40.056
- Agreed.

37:42.094 --> 37:42.993
Hey, look.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.295
- What's that?

37:45.297 --> 37:46.529
- Headlights.

37:48.734 --> 37:51.001
If there's a car,
there's a road.

37:51.003 --> 37:53.003
I vote we go that way.

37:53.005 --> 37:53.903
- Agreed.

38:00.746 --> 38:01.611
- What the fuck?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.446
Check this out.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.081
Coins.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.816
- That's weird.

38:06.818 --> 38:09.886
That must've been what was
splashing into the water.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.722
- Yeah but how,
they're just sitting.

38:12.724 --> 38:17.160
- The wind?

38:17.162 --> 38:19.596
- It's definitely what I heard.

38:22.601 --> 38:26.469
- Don't see
anything over there.

38:26.471 --> 38:27.737
- A squirrel.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.205
- A what?

38:29.207 --> 38:30.373
- A squirrel.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.474
You know, those little
fuzzy tree rats?

38:31.476 --> 38:33.710
- I know what a squirrel is.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.078
Maybe a squirrel came running--

38:36.882 --> 38:38.281
- What was that?

38:39.484 --> 38:40.884
- What the fuck?

38:42.387 --> 38:43.687
Holy shit!

38:43.689 --> 38:45.689
There's a kid in the water!

38:45.691 --> 38:48.058
- Oh my God, Tyler, hurry!

38:48.060 --> 38:50.794
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

38:51.963 --> 38:53.396
Oh my God!

38:53.398 --> 38:55.665
- Kayla, where's the kid?!

38:55.667 --> 38:57.300
- He's right there!

38:58.637 --> 38:59.536
- Where?!

39:00.872 --> 39:01.705
- He's right there!

39:01.707 --> 39:02.639
- Kayla, where?!

39:02.641 --> 39:03.707
- Tyler, he's right there!

39:03.709 --> 39:06.176
Hurry, he's gonna drown!

39:06.178 --> 39:07.977
- Kayla, where?!

39:14.286 --> 39:15.185
- Tyler?

39:17.622 --> 39:18.521
Tyler?

39:22.327 --> 39:23.793
Tyler?

39:23.795 --> 39:24.694
Tyler?

39:25.964 --> 39:26.863
Tyler?

39:27.899 --> 39:28.798
Tyler?!

39:32.003 --> 39:35.672
Got him!

39:35.674 --> 39:38.908
- Come on, come on,
come on, please!

39:42.714 --> 39:44.748
- What the fuck?!

39:44.750 --> 39:45.982
- Tyler?

39:45.984 --> 39:47.050
- Kayla!

39:50.689 --> 39:51.588
- Tyler!

39:53.458 --> 39:54.958
- Fuck!

40:03.335 --> 40:04.234
Help!

40:16.314 --> 40:17.313
- Somebody!

40:17.315 --> 40:19.716
Somebody, help, please!

40:19.718 --> 40:20.683
Somebody!

40:26.992 --> 40:27.991
Oh my God.

40:27.993 --> 40:30.727
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

40:38.970 --> 40:39.869
- Hold on.

40:40.972 --> 40:42.238
Michael, there's
absolutely no way

40:42.240 --> 40:44.340
that those lights
were this far off.

40:44.342 --> 40:47.210
- I was just thinking
the same thing.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.879
- How could we have
possibly missed the road?

40:49.881 --> 40:51.014
- I don't know.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.816
It was a car or truck lights.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.350
I just don't understand how
they drove through here.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.521
- What?
- Listen.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.226
- Is that?

41:03.228 --> 41:06.229
- Sounds like a crackling
of a fire, right?

41:08.200 --> 41:09.899
I think it's coming
from over there.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.601
That has to be them.

41:12.637 --> 41:13.503
Right?

41:17.809 --> 41:19.175
- Baby,
can we just leave?

41:19.177 --> 41:20.677
I wanna get out of here.

41:20.679 --> 41:23.313
- No, I have to figure this out.

41:24.516 --> 41:25.415
Oh, shit.

41:30.222 --> 41:31.120
Gianna?

41:32.257 --> 41:33.089
Gianna?!

41:33.091 --> 41:33.923
- What?!

41:33.925 --> 41:35.391
- Where are my notes?

41:35.393 --> 41:37.894
- I don't know,
they're in your bag.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.596
- No, no, no, they
were in the car,

41:39.598 --> 41:41.397
I said put them in my bag.

41:41.399 --> 41:43.366
Could you have left
them in the car?

41:43.368 --> 41:45.568
- Maybe, I don't know.

41:45.570 --> 41:46.469
- Fuck!

41:50.375 --> 41:52.075
You're gonna have
to go get them.

41:52.077 --> 41:54.544
- You want me to
go out there alone?

41:54.546 --> 41:56.346
- I can't leave here.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.283
I need them to
cleanse this place

42:00.285 --> 42:02.218
and cleanse ourselves.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.989
It's the only way we're
gonna get out of here.

42:18.470 --> 42:21.771
- I feel like we are
walking in circles.

42:23.108 --> 42:25.742
We should've come across
a trail or the road

42:25.744 --> 42:27.610
or anything by now.

42:27.612 --> 42:30.680
I don't know, maybe we should
be going towards the pounding.

42:30.682 --> 42:33.750
Maybe that's part
of Begory's thing.

42:36.655 --> 42:37.587
Shit, I just--

42:37.589 --> 42:39.689
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:41.993 --> 42:43.560
Do you smell that?

42:45.564 --> 42:46.462
Smoke.

42:48.533 --> 42:49.432
- Okay.

42:52.270 --> 42:54.270
It's right there.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.005
- All right.

42:56.007 --> 42:58.575
Let's get to the others and
get the hell out of here.

42:58.577 --> 42:59.475
- Finally.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.846
- Show yourselves.

43:04.683 --> 43:06.082
Show yourselves.

43:07.352 --> 43:08.751
Show yourselves.

43:10.021 --> 43:11.387
Show yourselves.

43:14.459 --> 43:16.392
- I'm sorry that I
dragged us our here.

43:16.394 --> 43:17.527
- No, that's fine.

43:17.529 --> 43:18.828
Just not do it again.

43:18.830 --> 43:21.564
Let's chalk it up and move on.

43:21.566 --> 43:22.465
- Agreed.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.539
What?

43:30.875 --> 43:32.208
- How could we?

43:39.517 --> 43:41.584
- There's a little girl.

43:51.863 --> 43:52.829
Sweetheart.

43:55.533 --> 43:58.601
Sweetheart, do you
live around here?

43:59.571 --> 44:01.738
Sweetheart, we're a little lost

44:01.740 --> 44:03.473
and we're trying
to find our friends

44:03.475 --> 44:05.642
and get back to our car.

44:05.644 --> 44:08.711
And we just are looking
for someone to help us.

44:08.713 --> 44:11.314
Do you know where
you parents are?

44:21.926 --> 44:24.594
- Go, go, go, go, go!

45:11.876 --> 45:13.276
- Michael!

45:13.278 --> 45:14.444
Michael!

45:15.480 --> 45:16.345
- Come on.

45:16.347 --> 45:17.246
Come on.

45:33.965 --> 45:35.531
- Show yourselves.

45:36.868 --> 45:38.267
Show yourselves.

45:39.270 --> 45:40.503
Where are you?

45:43.942 --> 45:45.341
Show yourselves.

46:32.157 --> 46:33.689
- Michael, what was that?

46:33.691 --> 46:35.091
Was is that back there?

46:35.093 --> 46:37.393
What is that fucking noise?

46:38.530 --> 46:40.429
- I don't know.

46:40.431 --> 46:41.631
We gotta get out of here.

46:41.633 --> 46:42.899
- Michael, where?

46:42.901 --> 46:43.900
We're just running
around in circles.

46:43.902 --> 46:45.701
We're completely lost.

46:45.703 --> 46:49.105
- No we're not,
look, it's a bridge.

46:49.107 --> 46:51.974
The ranger said
stick to the road.

46:51.976 --> 46:53.209
We got this.

46:53.211 --> 46:55.311
It's like 50 steps
and we're there.

46:55.313 --> 46:56.245
Come on, let's go.

46:56.247 --> 46:57.814
- Let's go, let's go.

46:57.816 --> 46:59.148
- Wait!
- What?

47:04.222 --> 47:05.188
What is it?

47:06.758 --> 47:09.625
- Looks like Tyler's shorts.

47:09.627 --> 47:10.593
Tyler!

47:10.595 --> 47:12.528
- Tyler!

47:12.530 --> 47:14.430
- Ty!
- Tyler!

47:16.501 --> 47:17.400
- Tyler!

47:18.903 --> 47:19.802
- Tyler!

47:21.439 --> 47:22.572
- Ty!
- Tyler!

47:24.175 --> 47:25.942
Tyler!

47:25.944 --> 47:27.476
Michael!

47:27.478 --> 47:28.544
- Oh my God!

47:29.581 --> 47:31.747
- Michael, no, Michael!

47:31.749 --> 47:32.582
- Is!

47:34.118 --> 47:35.051
- Michael!

47:35.053 --> 47:36.586
Oh my God, Michael!

47:36.588 --> 47:37.520
Michael!

47:37.522 --> 47:40.356
What was it that got you?!

47:41.559 --> 47:43.192
Are you okay, what
just happened?

47:43.194 --> 47:44.227
- Something grabbed me.

47:44.229 --> 47:45.728
- What?

47:45.730 --> 47:47.630
What do you mean,
something grabbed you?

47:47.632 --> 47:48.898
What do you mean?

47:48.900 --> 47:50.867
- Let's just get out of
here before we find out.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.440
- Are you okay?

47:57.442 --> 47:58.574
Are you okay?

47:58.576 --> 47:59.709
- Let's just get to the road.

47:59.711 --> 48:01.010
- Okay.

48:01.012 --> 48:02.845
I got you, I got you.

48:20.131 --> 48:21.597
- Oh, fuck.

48:21.599 --> 48:22.498
Okay.

48:24.836 --> 48:26.068
Check this.

48:26.070 --> 48:26.969
Got it.

48:30.675 --> 48:31.807
- You got it?

48:38.049 --> 48:41.050
Okay, just watch out for this.

48:41.052 --> 48:44.120
- I can't go any
further, hold on.

48:44.122 --> 48:46.188
Oh, it really hurts.

48:46.190 --> 48:48.157
- Let me look, come here.

48:48.159 --> 48:49.792
Let me take a look.

48:51.262 --> 48:52.161
Oh my God.

48:53.865 --> 48:54.931
- Is it bad?

48:56.401 --> 48:58.100
- It's really bad.

48:58.102 --> 48:59.001
- Okay.

49:04.642 --> 49:05.541
Oh, fuck.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.349
Oh, thank you.

49:31.469 --> 49:32.368
- Michael?

49:34.105 --> 49:35.004
- Yeah.

49:37.542 --> 49:39.108
- I wanna go home.

49:41.279 --> 49:42.678
I wanna go home.

49:43.681 --> 49:44.580
- I know.

49:45.717 --> 49:46.615
Me too.

49:50.655 --> 49:54.890
Let's just get to the others
and get the fuck out of here.

49:54.892 --> 49:56.892
We never crossed a bridge.

49:56.894 --> 50:00.296
So Tyler's truck has
got to be that way.

50:02.500 --> 50:06.402
- I am not going back
into the woods, Michael.

50:07.605 --> 50:08.938
- I understand.

50:10.842 --> 50:12.842
Walk right down this road.

50:12.844 --> 50:16.045
It's gotta go to the
other road, the main road.

50:16.047 --> 50:17.913
Once we get to the others,

50:17.915 --> 50:20.783
we'll figure it out
from there, okay?

50:23.688 --> 50:24.820
- Okay.

50:24.822 --> 50:25.721
Okay.

50:31.429 --> 50:33.029
- Help me up.

50:33.031 --> 50:34.930
You got this, come on.

50:42.140 --> 50:43.039
- Okay.

50:45.343 --> 50:46.242
- Okay.

51:30.588 --> 51:32.021
- Stop, do you hear that?

51:32.023 --> 51:33.556
- What?

51:35.093 --> 51:36.025
What is that?

51:36.027 --> 51:37.093
- It sounds like a little girl.

51:39.097 --> 51:40.563
- It's a trick, ignore it.

51:40.565 --> 51:42.398
- No, it's not,
Michael, I can hear her.

51:42.400 --> 51:43.866
- She's not real.

51:45.436 --> 51:46.569
Keep walking.

51:55.113 --> 51:58.314
- "Go to the vehicle
and get my things."

51:58.316 --> 52:01.317
How dare he talk
to me like that.

52:01.319 --> 52:03.152
How the fuck am I supposed
to get into the truck

52:03.154 --> 52:05.387
without any keys?

52:05.389 --> 52:06.255
Asshole.

52:15.833 --> 52:16.699
Begory?

52:19.437 --> 52:20.302
Oh my God.

52:21.439 --> 52:22.638
Oh my God.

52:26.444 --> 52:27.343
Oh my God.

52:28.913 --> 52:29.812
Help!

52:29.814 --> 52:31.547
Somebody help!

52:31.549 --> 52:32.581
Help!

52:55.940 --> 52:56.939
- Was that?

52:57.808 --> 52:58.707
- Come on.

53:36.380 --> 53:38.280
- Please help me, God.

53:41.986 --> 53:43.018
Help me!

53:43.020 --> 53:44.553
Please!

53:44.555 --> 53:45.387
- Run!

54:12.049 --> 54:13.616
- Gianna!
- Is!

54:13.618 --> 54:14.516
Oh my God!

54:15.653 --> 54:16.952
We need to run! We need to run!

54:16.954 --> 54:18.320
We need to get the
fuck out of here!

54:18.322 --> 54:19.755
- Okay, calm down, calm down.

54:19.757 --> 54:20.889
Slow down, what's going on?

54:20.891 --> 54:22.157
- You don't understand.

54:22.159 --> 54:23.892
There was a girl in the woods

54:23.894 --> 54:25.661
and Begory is dead.

54:25.663 --> 54:26.929
- A girl wearing a dress?

54:26.931 --> 54:29.098
- Yes and I
threw a rock at her.

54:29.100 --> 54:30.232
Another guy--

54:30.234 --> 54:32.268
- Begory is dead, are you sure?

54:32.270 --> 54:35.037
- Yes, we need to get
the fuck out of here!

54:35.039 --> 54:37.573
- Okay, all right,
we're together.

54:37.575 --> 54:39.441
We're together now.

54:39.443 --> 54:41.143
Michael, we need to go.

54:41.145 --> 54:42.978
- Yeah, we're going.

54:42.980 --> 54:44.680
- Where's
Kayla and Tyler?

54:44.682 --> 54:46.181
- We don't know, we
haven't seen them.

54:46.183 --> 54:51.153
- We found Tyler's shorts in
the river down by the bridge.

54:51.689 --> 54:52.621
- What bridge?

54:52.623 --> 54:54.056
- There's a bridge that way.

54:54.058 --> 54:56.425
- Begory was saying something
about a boy and a bridge

54:56.427 --> 54:59.662
and a man and a truck and
he wasn't making any sense.

54:59.664 --> 55:01.397
I'm not going anywhere
near any fucking bridge!

55:01.399 --> 55:03.332
- We're not going back to the
bridge either, don't worry.

55:03.334 --> 55:04.900
We're just gonna
stick near the truck

55:04.902 --> 55:06.402
and wait for
somebody to drive by.

55:06.404 --> 55:07.269
- Why are we gonna wait?

55:07.271 --> 55:08.337
Why don't we just leave?

55:08.339 --> 55:09.238
- No keys.

55:10.708 --> 55:12.675
Listen, they know we're here.

55:12.677 --> 55:13.909
- Who knows we're here?

55:13.911 --> 55:15.444
- When I came to
get Kayla's phone,

55:15.446 --> 55:16.912
a forest ranger came

55:16.914 --> 55:18.781
and he was suspicious about
us camping in the woods.

55:18.783 --> 55:22.818
I'm sure he's gonna come back
and make sure that we aren't.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.053
We're as good as out of here.

55:24.055 --> 55:24.953
Hey!

55:26.057 --> 55:27.222
Hey!

55:27.224 --> 55:28.057
- Help!

55:28.059 --> 55:29.658
- Hey!

55:29.660 --> 55:30.959
- Help! Help!

55:30.961 --> 55:32.027
- He's not stopping!

55:32.029 --> 55:33.028
Hey! Hey!

55:39.503 --> 55:41.570
What the fuck?!

55:41.572 --> 55:43.205
Yeah, you?

55:43.207 --> 55:44.340
- Gianna?!

55:44.342 --> 55:45.407
- I'm okay!

55:52.016 --> 55:53.048
- Gianna!

55:53.050 --> 55:54.717
No!
- No! No! No! No!

55:54.719 --> 55:55.751
Come back! Come back!

55:55.753 --> 55:57.419
No! No! No!

55:57.421 --> 55:59.021
We need to get help!

55:59.023 --> 56:00.389
- She needs help!

56:00.391 --> 56:01.824
- No! No! No!

56:01.826 --> 56:03.459
We need to get help!

56:03.461 --> 56:06.028
- How are we gonna
get help, Michael?!

56:06.030 --> 56:07.963
- We're gonna walk out of here.

56:07.965 --> 56:10.699
Straight down this fucking road.

56:11.569 --> 56:12.768
Come on.

56:12.770 --> 56:13.669
- Gia!

56:41.899 --> 56:43.132
You okay?

56:43.134 --> 56:45.667
- It just hurts.

56:45.669 --> 56:47.403
Just tie it tighter.

56:57.448 --> 56:58.647
- We're gonna get you back,

56:58.649 --> 56:59.615
we're gonna get you
straight to a hospital,

56:59.617 --> 57:01.116
okay, Michael?

57:01.118 --> 57:03.919
- Maybe to a priest too.

57:09.260 --> 57:10.426
Don't! Don't!

57:18.469 --> 57:19.802
- Michael?

57:19.804 --> 57:21.870
What the fuck is that?

57:21.872 --> 57:23.672
- They want us to run.

57:23.674 --> 57:25.207
- Why?

57:26.577 --> 57:27.910
- I don't know.

57:28.779 --> 57:30.579
But I'm done running.

57:31.415 --> 57:33.248
We have to get going.

57:42.193 --> 57:43.692
Shit, shit, shit.

57:57.675 --> 57:59.808
It's okay, he's gone, let's go.

57:59.810 --> 58:01.643
- I can't take this anymore.

58:01.645 --> 58:03.345
- We have to be
close to someone.

58:03.347 --> 58:04.246
Come on.

58:12.857 --> 58:13.755
- Michael.

58:16.594 --> 58:17.493
- Finally.

58:20.197 --> 58:21.096
- Come on.

58:24.235 --> 58:26.802
We're gonna go get some help
and then we're gonna go back

58:26.804 --> 58:28.804
and we're gonna get
our Gianna, okay?

58:28.806 --> 58:29.705
- Okay.

58:31.375 --> 58:33.609
- Okay, almost there.

58:33.611 --> 58:34.776
- Oh, shit.

58:34.778 --> 58:36.078
- Almost there.

58:38.048 --> 58:39.448
Hello?!

58:40.651 --> 58:41.617
Hello?!

58:41.619 --> 58:43.886
- Hello?!

58:43.888 --> 58:45.954
- Hello?!

58:45.956 --> 58:47.923
Is there anyone there?

58:47.925 --> 58:49.691
Come on! Come on!

58:52.696 --> 58:55.831
- Who
leaves the door open?

58:57.101 --> 58:58.433
- Hello, is there anybody there?

58:58.435 --> 59:00.636
Please, we need help!

59:00.638 --> 59:03.171
Can we come in, please?!

59:03.173 --> 59:04.072
Please?!

59:06.443 --> 59:08.210
Michael, please.

59:08.212 --> 59:10.078
Anywhere is fucking
better than out there.

59:10.080 --> 59:11.680
I can't be in the woods anymore!

59:11.682 --> 59:14.049
I can't be on that
road anymore, okay?!

59:14.051 --> 59:15.484
Look,

59:15.486 --> 59:16.418
this is a good place.

59:16.420 --> 59:18.820
We'll just get you off your foot

59:18.822 --> 59:21.023
and we'll check it out
and we'll just wait,

59:21.025 --> 59:23.125
we'll wait until the morning,
until the sun comes up,

59:23.127 --> 59:24.560
and then we'll go
back out to the road

59:24.562 --> 59:27.496
and wait for someone
to come, okay?

59:27.498 --> 59:28.864
Let's just go inside.

59:28.866 --> 59:30.065
- All right.
- Okay?

59:30.067 --> 59:31.300
Please.

59:31.302 --> 59:32.401
- It wouldn't hurt
to get off my foot.

59:32.403 --> 59:33.802
- Okay, come on.

59:34.672 --> 59:35.571
Come on.

59:45.683 --> 59:47.983
Just a little bit farther.

59:47.985 --> 59:51.286
All right, we're
gonna get you sat down

59:53.857 --> 59:55.057
and comfortable.

59:55.059 --> 59:57.626
- Take it slow, take it slow.

59:57.628 --> 59:58.760
- You got it.

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:02.264
- Look.

01:00:05.502 --> 01:00:07.002
- There's a fire.

01:00:07.972 --> 01:00:10.038
- Somebody must be here.

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:12.207
- Hello?

01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:14.776
- Hello?

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:18.880
- Come on, come on.

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:20.549
Put you right here.

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:25.754
Okay.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:27.222
- Take your time.

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:34.363
- Okay.

01:00:34.365 --> 01:00:35.497
Are you okay?

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:37.499

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:50.712

01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:58.920

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:29.578
Jess, is that you?

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:49.698

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:24.933
Jess?

01:03:47.558 --> 01:03:49.891
I missed you so much.

01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:33.668
- Jess!

01:04:37.274 --> 01:04:38.740
- That's Kayla!

01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:39.908

Kayla, it's me, babe!

01:04:53.357 --> 01:04:57.259

01:04:57.261 --> 01:04:58.727
Isabella?

01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:04.099

No, no, no, no.

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:57.612
Oh my God.

01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:07.055
Don't!

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:09.290
No!

01:07:35.519 --> 01:07:36.651
I'll be back.

01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:03.745

01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:07.015
Michael, Michael, Michael.

01:08:07.017 --> 01:08:08.349
Michael.

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:09.818
Michael, Michael.

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:12.620
- I can't!

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:13.288
- Michael,
Michael, Michael.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:14.422

What're you doing?

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.154
- You look beautiful.

01:09:25.162 --> 01:09:26.794
- Come here, silly.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.478

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:48.409
Jessica!

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:05.860
- This is it, babe.

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:06.928
- Stay on the road!

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:07.895
- Fuck!

01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:08.863
Get the fuck out of here!

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:10.365

01:11:12.569 --> 01:11:13.835
Holy shit.

01:11:13.837 --> 01:11:16.237
- Oh my God, what was
wrong with that guy?

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:18.006
- Don't worry, babe.

01:11:18.008 --> 01:11:21.309
It was just some
drunk on the road.

01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:23.444
- He scared the piss out of me.

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:24.879
What was he even saying?

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:27.482
- Just some drunk gibberish.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:30.418
- Too much tequila, I guess.

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.319
- Yeah.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:35.156
- You trying to scare
the panties off of me?

01:11:35.158 --> 01:11:36.724
- I didn't think you
were wearing any.

01:11:38.228 --> 01:11:39.627
- Maybe I'm not.

01:11:41.398 --> 01:11:43.031
- Surprise, surprise.

01:11:43.033 --> 01:11:44.966
I did scare the
panties off you, huh?

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:56.044
What the fuck?!

01:11:56.046 --> 01:11:58.546
- Oh my God, there's
a little girl outside.

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:00.014
- Where? I don't see anything.

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:02.016
- I swear, she was right
there looking right in here,

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:03.751
all creepy looking little girl.

01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:06.521
- Babe, babe, we're miles
away from the closest home.

01:12:06.523 --> 01:12:09.424
There I no way there's
a kid on this road.

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:13.161
- I know what I saw.

01:12:13.163 --> 01:12:14.128
What're you doing?

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:15.363
- I'm gonna go check it out.

01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:16.364
- No, don't go
out there, please.

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:17.298
- I'm going.

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.867
- No, John, stay here.

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:21.769
No, don't go out there.

01:12:22.806 --> 01:12:24.872
- Babe, seriously, look at me.

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:28.509
I'm pretty sure the kid sees
me, I'm gonna scare 'em off.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:29.410
Okay?

01:12:39.255 --> 01:12:40.922
- John!
