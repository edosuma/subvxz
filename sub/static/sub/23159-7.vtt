00:00.023 --> 00:05.222
Newspapers from 1936?
All about the Danforth murder case.

00:06.029 --> 00:09.931
- You're the private eye.
- You must be the dame in trouble.

00:09.966 --> 00:14.460
- I don't think you're in any condition to drive.
- Of course I can drive.

00:15.505 --> 00:18.633
T.C.? I knew I'd find you here, buddy!

00:18.675 --> 00:21.109
I ain't never seen you before in my life.

00:21.144 --> 00:23.806
- You get away from us.
- My father is innocent.

00:23.846 --> 00:26.440
I don't wanna see you till they execute him.

00:26.482 --> 00:29.883
T.C., behind you!

01:37.320 --> 01:41.256
<i>Someone told me once, with the wisdom
of too much beer and not enough sleep...</i>

01:42.100 --> 01:43.897
<i>Always listen to your dreams</i>,

01:44.427 --> 01:49.296
<i>because they're mirrors to your soul
and they always tell you the truth.</i>

01:52.268 --> 01:54.566
Hello? Magnum.

01:54.604 --> 01:57.937
<i>Listen, pal,
get down here right away. A client.</i>

02:01.310 --> 02:04.302
- Rick, what time is it?
- <i>A dame in big trouble</i>.

02:04.347 --> 02:07.009
<i>She just got off the clipper
and buzzed on over.</i>

02:11.220 --> 02:12.687
Clipper?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.401
<i>Number, please.
Number, please.</i>

02:28.471 --> 02:30.302
<i>Number, please</i>.

02:31.207 --> 02:33.368
<i>What party do you wish, sir?</i>

02:34.811 --> 02:37.143
Nothing. Nothing at all.

03:13.783 --> 03:14.772
Higgins.

03:19.355 --> 03:21.016
Higgins.

03:33.503 --> 03:37.337
- Higgins! Higgins!
- Lads, avert your eyes.

03:37.373 --> 03:40.399
What the hell did you do to my house?

03:40.443 --> 03:45.107
Magnum, old stick, isn't your attire a trifle
bi <i>z</i> arre even for you, even for breakfast?

03:45.148 --> 03:46.581
My underwear!

03:46.616 --> 03:48.914
What happened to my underwear?

03:48.951 --> 03:52.352
Another sordid night
with a chorus girl at the Kit Kat Club.

03:52.388 --> 03:55.880
Please stand downwind.
I'm sure you reek of cheap rye whiskey.

03:55.925 --> 03:59.520
What is this?
What kind of cra <i>z</i> y practical joke...

03:59.562 --> 04:05.694
I? I cra <i>z</i> ed? My dear fellow, it is not I
ranting about the lawn in my BVDs.

04:05.735 --> 04:10.695
- I'd suggest a shower and black coffee.
- OK, OK. Enough's enough.

04:10.740 --> 04:14.904
I can take a joke.
See? I'm smiling like a good sport!

04:14.944 --> 04:19.540
In 25 minutes, the members of my croquet
club will arrive for practice and brunch.

04:19.582 --> 04:23.712
- Since it's our last opportunity for strategy...
- Croquet?

04:25.087 --> 04:30.184
You short-sheet my whole house
and you wanna talk about croquet?

04:30.226 --> 04:34.686
With the Depression's unemployment,
despite President Roosevelt's efforts...

04:34.730 --> 04:39.690
- Sure, good old FDR! I'm with you!
- .. the chaps decided polo was ostentatious.

04:39.735 --> 04:42.568
So we turned to more proletarian pursuits.

04:42.605 --> 04:45.073
- Everybody was...
- Enough, enough!

04:46.409 --> 04:47.774
This is not funny.

04:49.045 --> 04:53.675
OK. OK, you croquet your hearts out,
but hear this ultimatum.

04:53.716 --> 04:56.241
I- mmediately!

04:56.285 --> 05:01.018
Immediately, I want my furniture,

05:01.057 --> 05:02.718
my phone

05:02.758 --> 05:05.750
and my shorts... back!

05:12.969 --> 05:14.402
A lesson, lads.

05:14.437 --> 05:17.634
Cheap whiskey in this heat can rot the brain.

05:24.714 --> 05:27.308
<i>I know what you're thinking,
but I was ahead of you.</i>

05:27.350 --> 05:33.255
<i>Higgins somehow, for some strange reason,
was playing an elaborate, expensive joke.</i>

05:33.289 --> 05:37.783
<i>Since he'd set the stage, I figured
I'd read enough Hammett and Chandler</i>

05:37.827 --> 05:40.352
<i>to give him a good performance</i>.

05:41.864 --> 05:46.699
Clearly this situation necessitates
a punishing but da <i>zz</i> ling sacrifice,

05:46.736 --> 05:49.330
not unlike the Second Battle of the Marne.

05:49.372 --> 05:50.805
Oh, Higgins.

05:53.175 --> 05:55.541
Excuse me just a moment.

05:59.548 --> 06:02.540
I hope this won't be
another embarrassing scene.

06:02.585 --> 06:05.053
I, interrupt the Battle of the Marne?

06:05.087 --> 06:08.420
Second Battle of the Marne.
After your squalid display...

06:08.457 --> 06:12.120
The Ferrari, where is it, old stick,
and I'll be on my way?

06:12.161 --> 06:16.495
- What the bla <i>z</i> es are you talking about?
- You haven't forgotten the automobile?

06:16.532 --> 06:18.363
Just gimme the keys!

06:18.401 --> 06:20.995
Since you insist on leaving it in the ignition,

06:21.037 --> 06:25.098
I though it only prudent
to protect Mr. Masters' property.

06:26.342 --> 06:27.832
What...?

06:29.145 --> 06:30.134
Where is it?

06:47.663 --> 06:50.154
It's beautiful, of course.

06:50.199 --> 06:52.030
Well, it should be.

06:52.068 --> 06:56.664
Freshly re-lacquered after you took
that shortcut through a cane field.

06:59.108 --> 07:03.101
- This the handbrake?
- Yes, precisely where it's always been.

07:03.145 --> 07:06.979
- I don't think you're in any condition to drive.
- Course I can drive!

07:23.632 --> 07:25.793
Yanks.

07:26.836 --> 07:32.103
<i>I could understand Higgins switching
the furniture, the phone, the clothes. Almost.</i>

07:32.141 --> 07:37.306
<i>But the whole island was different,
as if I'd made a left turn back into my dream.</i>

07:37.346 --> 07:40.543
<i>Where were the highways,
the high rises, the people?</i>

07:40.583 --> 07:45.919
<i>Even Higgins couldn't change all that.
There were two possible explanations.</i>

07:45.955 --> 07:48.788
<i>Either I was crazy,
in which case I could scream,</i>

07:48.824 --> 07:53.318
<i>or I was still dreaming, in which case
I could lie back and enjoy this fantasy.</i>

07:53.362 --> 07:56.024
<i>You're right, it wasn't much of a choice</i>.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.133
<i>It was kinda fun, actually</i>.

08:04.173 --> 08:08.166
<i>I had an appointment at the old
King Kamehameha Club 50 years ago</i>

08:08.210 --> 08:10.610
<i>with a dame just off the clipper</i>.

08:10.646 --> 08:16.209
<i>The club turned out to be some kinda place,
with a manager that was vaguely familiar.</i>

08:16.252 --> 08:18.618
Magnum.

08:18.654 --> 08:22.351
- Hey, pal, it's about time.
- Rick!

08:23.459 --> 08:26.121
Where ya been? There's a dame in trouble.

08:26.162 --> 08:31.259
Dame in trouble? You work here?
Oh, yeah, sure, of course you do.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.631
- Magnum, you OK?
- Rick...

08:34.669 --> 08:37.639
do I look different to you?

08:38.207 --> 08:40.198
You look just swell.

08:41.744 --> 08:44.679
Brenda McCutchen, Thomas Magnum.

08:44.713 --> 08:47.876
- You're the private eye.
- Private investigator.

08:52.154 --> 08:54.952
You must be the dame in trouble.

08:56.659 --> 09:00.686
- Got an extra beer, Rick?
- Yeah, Magnum, coming right up.

09:03.599 --> 09:08.002
- It's about my father Hank. He's been...
- I know.

09:08.037 --> 09:12.770
He's been accused of murdering
Taft Danforth, the construction magnate.

09:12.808 --> 09:15.470
The police are holding him for questioning...

09:16.579 --> 09:19.412
while they continue their investigation.

09:20.749 --> 09:22.876
How... how could you know all of that?

09:24.220 --> 09:26.688
That's what I get paid for, Miss McCutchen.

09:31.827 --> 09:35.957
Did I tell ya, baby, or did I tell ya?
One peach of a detective.

09:35.998 --> 09:40.435
That's what took you so long to get here.
You were out checking... Hey, you OK?

09:40.469 --> 09:42.403
I cut my...

09:43.405 --> 09:44.394
lip.

09:44.440 --> 09:48.706
I'll take care of that.
I'll give that bartender a two-inch neck.

09:49.345 --> 09:54.339
- Mr. Magnum, is it terribly painful?
- No, it's just...

09:55.818 --> 09:58.218
dreams aren't supposed to bleed.

10:04.894 --> 10:10.230
Taft Danforth told your father he'd shut the
company down rather than let the union in?

10:10.266 --> 10:16.000
Right. He called him names and then
he accused him of being a communist.

10:16.038 --> 10:21.442
- Daddy was even afraid for his life.
- Is that when he started carrying a gun?

10:21.477 --> 10:24.139
I don't know anything about any gun.

10:25.314 --> 10:29.148
Maybe Taft Danforth didn't either.
He wound up dead.

10:29.184 --> 10:33.848
Look, if you knew my father,
you'd know exactly how ridiculous that is.

10:35.491 --> 10:38.927
He reads classical Greek
and he loves Mo <i>z</i> art.

10:38.961 --> 10:42.124
He's the gentlest man
you'd ever want to meet.

10:42.164 --> 10:48.501
Brenda, ask yourself the same question
the police have been asking your father.

10:49.505 --> 10:52.906
What was he doing
in Danforth's house that night?

10:54.443 --> 10:56.434
He swallowed his pride

10:56.478 --> 10:59.641
and he went to appeal
to Mr. Danforth one last time.

11:00.649 --> 11:04.141
But he was already dead,
slumped there at his desk.

11:05.721 --> 11:12.058
- Two minutes later the police arrived.
- The police report said your father ran for it.

11:12.094 --> 11:14.824
Well, of course he ran for it. He was set up.

11:18.100 --> 11:22.161
They don't have a gun.
How will they prove murder without a weapon?

11:22.204 --> 11:26.334
Well, the police figure that...

11:26.942 --> 11:30.343
your father hid the gun in the garden...

11:32.281 --> 11:34.272
when they were arriving.

11:36.619 --> 11:41.579
And then ran back inside so they could
find him next to the body? Mr. Magnum!

11:45.194 --> 11:48.027
My father's time is running out.

11:48.063 --> 11:51.658
The Danforths are very wealthy and powerful.

11:52.635 --> 11:56.036
If you're not willing to take them on,
I'll find someone who is.

11:58.774 --> 12:02.175
Those of us
who loved Taft Danforth in life,

12:02.211 --> 12:05.009
admired his straightforward character

12:05.047 --> 12:09.609
and appreciated his lively aesthetic sensibility,

12:09.652 --> 12:12.382
feel the sharp pain of loss,

12:12.421 --> 12:15.788
but we cannot selfishly grieve.

12:15.824 --> 12:21.057
Not his devoted wife Marion
nor his loyal son Drew,

12:21.096 --> 12:25.760
because our God has taught us that,
like His own son,

12:25.801 --> 12:31.330
our son has found life everlasting.

12:41.917 --> 12:43.908
Sure this isn't a mistake?

12:45.320 --> 12:48.483
I have nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. Magnum,

12:48.524 --> 12:51.015
and neither does my father.

12:51.060 --> 12:55.156
And I can't let that poor woman
think we are so unfeeling

12:55.197 --> 12:59.793
that we can't go over and say
how sorry we are for her and her son.

13:05.074 --> 13:08.339
Excuse me. Excuse me, Mrs. Danforth.

13:09.411 --> 13:11.743
I'm sorry for intruding,

13:11.780 --> 13:15.773
but I wanted to tell you
how very sorry I am about your husband.

13:15.818 --> 13:19.811
- You were acquainted with my husband?
- Well, no, ma'am.

13:20.823 --> 13:23.087
My father is Harold McCutchen.

13:24.126 --> 13:27.391
Leave us alone.
Hasn't your family done enough to us?

13:27.429 --> 13:30.921
- Brenda, maybe we'd better go.
- No, wait.

13:30.966 --> 13:33.491
Look, I just want to make you understand.

13:33.535 --> 13:35.162
My father is innocent.

13:35.204 --> 13:39.664
- He could never do anything like this.
- Your father...

13:39.708 --> 13:45.010
Your father came to our islands
uninvited, unwanted,

13:45.047 --> 13:48.983
and tried to destroy our business
with his greedy union.

13:49.017 --> 13:52.783
And, when he failed,
he destroyed my husband instead.

13:53.655 --> 13:56.385
He broke into our... home...

13:56.425 --> 13:59.121
and shot my husband through the head.

14:03.866 --> 14:08.132
Get away from us. I don't wanna see you
till the day they execute your father.

14:09.371 --> 14:11.362
We were just leaving.

14:19.481 --> 14:24.111
Drew, I think it'd be wise
to find out who that man was back there.

14:24.153 --> 14:27.247
I can't tolerate any problems right now.

14:27.289 --> 14:31.282
If there are any problems,
we should eliminate them.

14:33.295 --> 14:36.128
I only wanted to make them understand.

14:37.499 --> 14:41.094
Somehow, I get the feeling
that's gonna be pretty tough.

14:48.735 --> 14:54.503
Magnum, I managed to find the newspapers
with the salient details of this tragic story.

14:54.547 --> 14:58.540
- You will treat them with great care.
- Higgins, I will be careful.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.617
I thought you chaps gave up polo.

15:04.657 --> 15:09.492
I said we had given up on what has
come to seem like ostentatious display.

15:09.529 --> 15:13.989
An afternoon canter is eminently civili <i>z</i> ed.
Please take care of those!

15:14.033 --> 15:17.025
I can't explain. I've got this little time problem.

15:17.070 --> 15:20.062
I don't suppose you know the Danforth family.

15:20.106 --> 15:24.270
On this entire island, there are
only a few do <i>z</i> en people worth knowing.

15:24.310 --> 15:27.643
Of course I'm acquainted with the Danforths.

15:28.881 --> 15:32.942
- Well?
- You're asking me to engage in gossip?

15:32.986 --> 15:36.683
- Pernicious speculation about the private...
- Yes, yes!

15:36.723 --> 15:40.352
I am asking you to tell me everything -
every last detail.

15:41.127 --> 15:43.789
A man's life is at stake here,
an innocent man,

15:43.830 --> 15:49.200
and that outweighs any consideration
for the Danforth reputation, living or dead.

15:52.071 --> 15:56.064
Well, since you choose to put it so primitively.

15:58.311 --> 16:02.270
Marion Hubbell
was a 25-year-old spinster in the making.

16:02.315 --> 16:07.810
Not an unattractive girl, but hardly the sort
to captivate a dashing rogue like Taft.

16:07.854 --> 16:11.449
Let me guess, her father was filthy rich.

16:11.491 --> 16:14.654
A bank, a plantation
and a large construction company,

16:14.694 --> 16:17.094
but no family except Marion.

16:17.130 --> 16:20.827
When Taft wanted to buy the company,
Mr. Hubbell accommodated him.

16:20.867 --> 16:25.361
Marion and Taft were married.
In due course, their son Drew was born.

16:25.405 --> 16:27.532
Some would say that's a fair trade-off.

16:27.573 --> 16:32.306
In good conscience, I hasten to add
that no scandal ever touched the Danforths.

16:32.345 --> 16:35.678
They are... were a perfect couple.

16:36.616 --> 16:38.379
One more question.

16:38.418 --> 16:43.685
- Is there an air charter service round here?
- One wretchedly impoverished outfit.

16:43.723 --> 16:47.989
No doubt engaging it would
instantly result in either death or mutilation.

16:48.027 --> 16:50.689
And now, if this interrogation is over,

16:50.730 --> 16:54.393
I have an appointment with a captivating mare.

17:16.356 --> 17:19.848
<i>It took me two hours to find
Higgins' wretched little airport.</i>

17:19.892 --> 17:23.726
<i>When I finally got there,
I knew I'd never seen it before,</i>

17:23.762 --> 17:28.723
<i>but somehow I knew exactly who'd be there
to greet me when I arrived.</i>

17:30.103 --> 17:35.473
I knew I'd find you here, buddy!
Come on, let's go have a drink.

17:36.776 --> 17:41.372
- I know you, mister?
- Well, sure! Hey, don't you recogni <i>z</i> e me?

17:45.885 --> 17:50.549
Sorry, sir, I ain't never seen you
before in my life. You OK?

17:51.491 --> 17:52.753
Well, yeah, sure.

17:53.793 --> 17:56.523
I'm fine, I just thought you'd know.

17:57.330 --> 18:00.595
You here to charter a plane?
Cos the place is closed.

18:04.237 --> 18:08.936
<i>* Ain't nobody's business if I do</i>... <i>*</i>

18:08.975 --> 18:12.035
Looks like you take good care of that engine.

18:12.078 --> 18:13.102
You the pilot?

18:14.147 --> 18:16.445
No, I ain't the pilot.

18:17.517 --> 18:21.783
- What did you say?
- I said, you know I ain't the pilot.

18:21.821 --> 18:25.416
Us coloreds don't fly the planes,
we just work on 'em.

18:26.859 --> 18:31.694
You come up here to make fun of me?
Cos if you are, I got work to do.

18:31.731 --> 18:35.258
No. No,
I'm just interested in planes, that's all.

18:40.740 --> 18:43.573
Hey, T.C., look,

18:43.609 --> 18:47.477
all I'm asking is for you to have a drink with me

18:47.513 --> 18:49.413
and I'm paying.

18:49.449 --> 18:51.178
So as a favor, a favor for...

18:52.351 --> 18:55.752
an almost friend, would you do this for me?

18:59.125 --> 19:00.615
Mr...?

19:01.627 --> 19:04.027
- Magnum.
- Yeah.

19:04.063 --> 19:07.226
Theodore Calvin. You got a place in mind?

19:07.266 --> 19:09.257
The China Terrace.

19:11.637 --> 19:14.800
You're gonna take me to the China Terrace?

19:15.875 --> 19:18.867
Begging your pardon, sir, but you're cra <i>z</i> y.

19:20.313 --> 19:22.907
So cra <i>z</i> y, I might just go for the fun of it.

19:30.122 --> 19:33.683
* Am I blue?

19:34.627 --> 19:38.791
* Am I blue?

19:38.831 --> 19:48.331
* Ain't these tears in these eyes tellin' you?

19:49.542 --> 19:54.002
* Am I blue?

19:54.046 --> 19:57.607
* You'd be too... *

19:57.650 --> 20:00.585
<i>As it turns out,
this was the hottest club in Honolulu</i>

20:00.620 --> 20:04.215
<i>where only the finest people
came to dance and drink.</i>

20:04.257 --> 20:06.282
<i>But from the looks we got,</i>

20:06.325 --> 20:09.988
<i>I had the feeling T.C. and I
might not be on the A list.</i>

20:10.029 --> 20:12.964
- Good evening, sir. Will we be one tonight?
- Hello.

20:12.999 --> 20:15.661
No, we will be two tonight, thank you.

20:19.639 --> 20:22.574
I'm sorry, sir. You see, our club is...

20:22.608 --> 20:24.633
We're exclusive.

20:25.711 --> 20:28.703
Oh, you mean no lowlife. I should hope not.

20:28.748 --> 20:33.082
No, sir, what I mean is... we're restricted.
I'm sure you understand.

20:33.119 --> 20:36.247
Oh, well,
I'm sure Mr. Louis would appreciate that.

20:36.289 --> 20:39.452
He's in training for his next fight
and it's essential

20:39.492 --> 20:41.653
that his mental balance not be disturbed.

20:42.662 --> 20:46.291
Mr. Louis? You mean, Joe...?

20:46.332 --> 20:50.826
We'll be in the bar. If you could steer
the lowlife away from us, we'd appreciate it.

20:50.870 --> 20:52.861
Thank you very much.

21:00.179 --> 21:03.171
I'll have a beer.
Cup of coffee for my friend here.

21:03.215 --> 21:06.048
How do you know I don't drink?

21:06.085 --> 21:08.212
It's my dream.

21:09.322 --> 21:13.782
* Was I gay

21:13.826 --> 21:17.694
* Till today? *

21:17.730 --> 21:19.391
Thank you.

21:20.166 --> 21:23.761
Well, Mr. Magnum,
you may be cra <i>z</i> y, but you got style.

21:24.770 --> 21:33.838
* Am I blue? *

21:48.427 --> 21:50.759
I smell trouble. Come on.

21:50.796 --> 21:55.859
Uh... what about my cup of coffee?
My exclusive, restricted cup of coffee.

21:55.901 --> 21:59.462
- It can wait.
- Yeah, man, but I can't.

21:59.505 --> 22:04.204
Right. You stay here,
keep an eye on things.

22:04.243 --> 22:06.803
I'm gonna check on a friend.

22:06.846 --> 22:10.009
For a guy who just got into town,
you make friends quick.

22:10.049 --> 22:12.984
You think she'll know who you are?

22:13.019 --> 22:15.419
Everybody else does.

22:18.391 --> 22:19.722
Uh...

22:19.759 --> 22:23.251
He'll be back, friend. I'll watch it for him.

22:29.802 --> 22:31.394
Yes?

22:38.844 --> 22:40.106
You like fresh air?

22:41.247 --> 22:42.942
It gets stale in this place.

22:45.751 --> 22:47.082
This is great.

22:47.119 --> 22:49.815
<i>Lieutenant</i>...

22:49.855 --> 22:51.789
What are you? A cop?

22:57.329 --> 22:58.819
Do I look like a cop?

23:00.566 --> 23:03.194
You don't have flowers, so you're not a fan.

23:03.235 --> 23:06.932
Is that what Drew Danforth was? A fan?

23:06.972 --> 23:10.806
You don't look rich enough
to be anything interesting.

23:11.977 --> 23:16.175
- You must be a cop.
- I'm a private investigator.

23:20.720 --> 23:24.121
You wanna keep your ears
attached to your head, don't move.

23:24.156 --> 23:27.057
- Right.
- Where's your friend?

23:27.093 --> 23:31.120
- Mr. Magnum.
- Mr. Magnum? He ain't no friend of mine.

23:31.163 --> 23:35.827
- I just met him two or three hours ago.
- I said, where is he?

23:35.868 --> 23:39.861
I've been working
on the murder of Drew's father.

23:41.941 --> 23:45.638
Which is why I was wondering
what he was doing here.

23:45.678 --> 23:49.512
The islands are full of rich boys
who consider a singer fair game.

23:49.548 --> 23:51.914
They come backstage thinking...

23:52.585 --> 23:55.179
Well... you know...

23:56.756 --> 24:00.021
I'm almost grateful you knocked on my door.

24:00.059 --> 24:03.187
Grateful enough to tell me about... Drew?

24:04.096 --> 24:06.223
I already have.

24:22.715 --> 24:24.706
T.C., behind you!

24:34.927 --> 24:39.091
Stop! I absolutely insist
you stop this pugilistic display!

24:49.809 --> 24:53.745
T.C., I can't take you anywhere. Come on.

24:59.118 --> 25:04.146
<i>Even though T.C. didn't finish his coffee,
I got the feeling he enjoyed himself anyway.</i>

25:04.190 --> 25:06.556
<i>Me, I was just confused</i>.

25:06.592 --> 25:11.188
<i>I had no idea what the three yo-yos from
Taft Danforth's funeral were doing there,</i>

25:11.230 --> 25:12.720
<i>but I'm sure Marion did</i>.

25:12.765 --> 25:15.393
<i>I wished someone'd tell me</i>.

25:15.434 --> 25:17.265
<i>The one thing I knew for certain was</i>

25:17.303 --> 25:22.172
<i>the evening's events would give Brenda
and her father something to smile about.</i>

25:22.208 --> 25:24.472
- Hello?
- Thomas?

25:24.510 --> 25:26.637
<i>Brenda? What's wrong?</i>

25:27.880 --> 25:32.681
Marion Danforth has made
a positive identification of my father's voice.

25:32.718 --> 25:37.519
She said he was the man she heard shouting
at her husband just before he was shot.

25:37.556 --> 25:39.956
- She was there at the house?
- <i>Yes</i>.

25:41.227 --> 25:46.255
The DA's decided he's going
to prosecute my father for first-degree murder.

25:53.203 --> 25:56.366
<i>Someone once said,
"Living well is the best revenge."</i>

25:56.406 --> 26:01.207
<i>If that's true, Mrs. Danforth
had gotten more than her share, a lot more.</i>

26:04.981 --> 26:08.974
<i>I got in by convincing a maid
and two butlers I was a long-lost cousin.</i>

26:09.019 --> 26:13.820
<i>I know, it's an old trick,
but 50 years ago, it was still pretty fresh.</i>

26:14.658 --> 26:16.819
Strange...

26:17.861 --> 26:20.352
I don't see a family resemblance,

26:20.397 --> 26:24.390
but then no one in my family
was ever arrested for breaking and entering.

26:24.434 --> 26:27.597
Maybe I'm here to re-finish the furniture.

26:28.905 --> 26:31.635
Your butler said you were out.

26:31.675 --> 26:35.270
- He's so very protective.
- Like your chauffeur and his two pals?

26:37.581 --> 26:40.982
I won't even pretend
to know what that means.

26:41.017 --> 26:42.951
Thank you.

26:44.688 --> 26:48.681
They did their best to take me
apart at the China Terrace.

26:49.726 --> 26:53.389
Their best doesn't seem
to have been good enough, does it?

26:55.265 --> 26:59.759
- You're not surprised to see me?
- Very surprised to see you at the funeral.

26:59.803 --> 27:03.967
Now you're like an old friend -
an unwanted old friend.

27:04.007 --> 27:09.070
- Do you work for my husband's murderer?
- Did these things work with fluid?

27:09.112 --> 27:11.603
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

27:11.648 --> 27:14.981
My name is Thomas Magnum.
I'm a private investigator.

27:15.018 --> 27:19.819
I just dropped by to search your garden
for the missing gun. You haven't seen it?

27:20.390 --> 27:22.756
It's a very large garden.

27:23.760 --> 27:28.663
Perhaps the thief took it. While we were at
the funeral, someone broke into Taft's desk.

27:28.698 --> 27:31.861
Oh, really? What did he take?

27:31.902 --> 27:34.393
My husband's desk was private.

27:35.472 --> 27:40.307
And since you didn't know what was in it,
you couldn't know what was missing.

27:40.343 --> 27:46.771
When I was at school, I was very unpopular.
For some reason, the other girls hated me.

27:46.816 --> 27:51.276
It's given me a certain...
independence later in life.

27:52.289 --> 27:54.587
I'll come to the point.

27:54.624 --> 27:59.561
How much is it going to cost me to make
you go away and stop this harassment?

27:59.596 --> 28:00.961
How about $10,000?

28:00.997 --> 28:06.458
It seems like a fair price for
a wealthy widow to pay for peace of mind.

28:13.310 --> 28:16.711
My lawyer will send you a check
in the morning.

28:17.847 --> 28:22.011
Tell him not to bother.
I just wanted to see if you'd pay it.

28:24.254 --> 28:30.090
Take my advice. Cut back on your smoking.
Turns out it's harmful to your health.

28:33.463 --> 28:36.955
<i>- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's my head.</i>

28:37.000 --> 28:38.661
<i>I'm so tired</i>.

28:38.702 --> 28:42.365
<i>- Would you mind awfully if I went to bed?
- No, not a bit.</i>

28:43.840 --> 28:48.777
<i>Oh, gosh, I guess most of the gang is
and I'm no different than any of the rest.</i>

28:48.812 --> 28:52.805
<i>I think you'd know enough by now
when to leave the girl alone.</i>

28:52.849 --> 28:55.079
<i>It'll be hard enough getting Laura married</i>.

28:55.118 --> 28:58.349
- Thank you for coming.
- <i>I don't wanna get Laura married</i>.

28:58.388 --> 28:59.719
- Popcorn?
- Shh.

28:59.756 --> 29:01.314
<i>Any of our children married</i>.

29:01.358 --> 29:06.022
It's real butter. And you can get to your seat
without your feet sticking to the floor.

29:06.062 --> 29:09.657
I called you when I heard
they'd charged that poor man with murder.

29:10.433 --> 29:15.769
- I know he's innocent.
- The thought just suddenly came to you, huh?

29:15.805 --> 29:19.741
The night Taft died,
my house was broken into, torn apart.

29:19.776 --> 29:22.904
They didn't find what they were looking for.

29:23.980 --> 29:29.850
- You just called Danforth by his first name.
- We were lovers for almost three years.

29:30.820 --> 29:34.722
He wrote me love letters,
even signed papers so I'd have money.

29:35.458 --> 29:38.359
Is that why his son came to see you?

29:38.395 --> 29:41.228
Taft was going to divorce his wife.

29:42.932 --> 29:45.526
Marisa...

29:45.568 --> 29:48.833
they're always going to divorce their wives.

29:50.106 --> 29:51.266
Taft was.

29:52.075 --> 29:56.569
He had a reason. I'm pregnant with his child.

30:08.658 --> 30:13.561
- Tell me about the papers that he signed.
- They have a cottage at Kahana Bay.

30:13.596 --> 30:14.585
Taft and I...

30:16.599 --> 30:18.464
we spent time there.

30:18.501 --> 30:21.868
- That's where I hid the papers.
- Can we get them?

30:21.905 --> 30:25.500
Meet me tonight at this address.
I'll take you there.

30:32.849 --> 30:37.650
<i>Oh, what a pity.
And the baby coming any time now.</i>

30:39.656 --> 30:44.252
Keep it up, old girl.
You just might have a future as an actress.

30:46.229 --> 30:48.163
<i>No, no, no, no</i>.

30:48.198 --> 30:52.362
I know you're a terrific pilot.
I can tell by just looking at you.

30:52.402 --> 30:56.998
Go on, tell me the truth.
You've been flying on the sly.

30:57.040 --> 31:01.067
Well... so what if I have, maybe once or twice?

31:01.111 --> 31:04.569
- See, I knew it!
- I haven't got no license.

31:05.148 --> 31:09.812
- You're asking me to steal a plane?
- Borrow. No one will know the difference.

31:10.420 --> 31:14.083
Fly and land on a pile of sand or rock
in the middle of nowhere?

31:14.124 --> 31:17.924
- Yeah, it's better than a runway.
- Just saying it makes my skin crawl.

31:17.961 --> 31:20.623
- I know you can do it.
- The cost.

31:20.663 --> 31:24.292
Hey, gas all the way out there
would cost at least a buck, easy.

31:24.334 --> 31:28.498
Gas money. I was just getting around to that.
I'll pay for gas.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.597
Yeah, same way you paid for that drink?

31:30.640 --> 31:35.577
You know, something has been telling me
to leave this man alone.

31:35.612 --> 31:38.775
- This time, I'm listening.
- No, no, wait, wait, wait.

31:38.815 --> 31:44.651
Hold on a minute. I'll make a deal with you.
Just go with me to Marisa's. No obligation.

31:44.687 --> 31:48.145
If you're not genuinely moved by her story,
go home.

31:48.191 --> 31:50.682
- No hard feelings.
- No hard feelings?

31:50.727 --> 31:53.321
None. Now, what harm can it do?

31:55.131 --> 31:58.965
Harm? We'll get arrested for trespassing.
She ain't home.

32:01.404 --> 32:04.396
She probably just fell asleep. Come on.

32:04.441 --> 32:06.432
What's with this "come on"?

32:08.945 --> 32:10.936
Hey, this is as far as I'm goin'.

32:12.315 --> 32:14.306
Hey, you hear me?

32:16.986 --> 32:20.979
Mr. Magnum, what's going on?
I'm starting to sound as cra <i>z</i> y as he is.

32:23.893 --> 32:27.294
Mr. Magnum, what's going... on?

32:28.865 --> 32:33.199
She's dead, T.C.
They shot her and left her for me to find.

32:36.906 --> 32:38.897
Oh, my goodness.

32:43.313 --> 32:47.773
Mr. Magnum, come on.
Somebody else is about to find her and us, too.

32:47.817 --> 32:50.615
- We can't just leave her.
- No! Come on, come on.

32:50.653 --> 32:55.317
- You go. I'll talk to the police.
- Man, can't you see you been set up?

32:55.358 --> 33:00.022
Somebody killed her and called the cops.
They'll nail you for this as sure as daybreak.

33:00.063 --> 33:01.724
Now, come on!

33:07.670 --> 33:11.299
Mr. Magnum, come on,
we got a plane to get ready.

33:16.546 --> 33:18.878
<i>The sound of that single-engine</i>

33:18.915 --> 33:22.407
<i>was as sweet as T.C.'s chopper
in Nam on a rescue mission.</i>

33:22.452 --> 33:25.046
<i>I knew he could make
the landing at Kahana Bay</i>

33:25.088 --> 33:27.352
<i>just like I knew I could count on him</i>.

33:27.390 --> 33:29.381
<i>Some things are timeless</i>.

33:47.844 --> 33:53.680
You stay here. If I'm not back within an hour,
leave without me and get some help.

33:53.716 --> 33:57.948
Oh, and, T.C., thanks a lot... for everything.

33:58.421 --> 34:00.480
Just like old times!

34:31.420 --> 34:35.357
<i>The Danforth cottage at Kahana Bay
was right out of F. Scott Fitzgerald.</i>

34:35.391 --> 34:41.056
<i>I half expected to see Marisa and her lover
sipping mint juleps and enjoying the sunset.</i>

34:43.099 --> 34:48.264
<i>But after what happened to Marisa,
I was just as happy not to see anyone at all.</i>

35:00.917 --> 35:03.249
<i>You know, it's funny about dreams</i>.

35:03.286 --> 35:05.413
<i>I'd never seen the Danforth cottage,</i>

35:05.455 --> 35:09.949
<i>but somehow I knew exactly
where Marisa had hidden those papers.</i>

35:49.932 --> 35:51.593
Magnum.

35:53.970 --> 35:57.462
I know what you've got there.
Just put it on the step... slowly.

35:57.507 --> 36:03.173
This is none of your business, Magnum,
any of it. It's certainly not worth dying for.

36:06.049 --> 36:08.449
- Or worth killing for?
- It's a family affair.

36:09.118 --> 36:12.485
I know, it's all about family honor
and dishonor.

36:12.522 --> 36:15.548
- You don't know anything.
- But I can guess.

36:15.591 --> 36:19.857
They didn't find a gun cos you
took it with you after you shot your father.

36:19.896 --> 36:23.730
Your mother waited for McCutchen
to show up and called the cops.

36:23.766 --> 36:26.428
- Like you said, guesses.
- You murdered Marisa.

36:27.770 --> 36:30.432
With your father dead, there was no divorce,

36:30.473 --> 36:37.140
but with Marisa and her baby dead,
there was no ugly scandal and no heir.

36:37.180 --> 36:42.777
That baby... would've been
a bastard half-breed, not a Danforth.

36:42.819 --> 36:45.481
Was it your idea
or did your mother talk you into it?

36:45.521 --> 36:48.319
- Leave her out of this.
- What was hardest for her?

36:48.357 --> 36:53.659
The idea of divorce, the thought
of another woman, or was it the baby?

36:53.696 --> 36:56.859
Just put the papers on the step there,
Magnum.

36:58.668 --> 37:00.966
- Don't have them.
- Too bad.

37:24.627 --> 37:26.288
Magnum!

38:07.469 --> 38:09.403
Magnum.

38:09.438 --> 38:14.273
<i>Thomas, buddy, you planning on
sleeping the day away? Get right down here.</i>

38:14.309 --> 38:17.437
- What's going on?
- <i>Your client's looking for you</i>.

38:17.479 --> 38:19.947
<i>I can't stall her forever, pal</i>.

38:35.130 --> 38:37.690
Magnum?

38:38.500 --> 38:40.764
Hello in there.

38:44.573 --> 38:46.564
Are you decent?

38:47.776 --> 38:51.769
"Decent" probably isn't the proper word.
It implies moral judgment.

38:51.814 --> 38:56.308
- "Presentable" would be more appropriate.
- No bullet hole!

38:57.052 --> 38:58.713
No bullet hole, Higgins!

39:00.422 --> 39:02.049
I say, Magnum, are you all right?

39:05.627 --> 39:06.616
Sneakers!

39:08.430 --> 39:09.920
Sneakers, Higgins!

39:10.499 --> 39:12.126
No more cream-and-tans!

39:13.068 --> 39:17.562
No more baggy underwear!
No great white suit either, but that's OK.

39:17.606 --> 39:20.666
- Magnum... Magnum...
- I had this dream...

39:20.709 --> 39:24.167
I came in here to pick up
these newspapers which I borrowed

39:24.213 --> 39:26.773
- from the university archives...
- Newspapers?

39:26.815 --> 39:31.218
And which you promised to treat
with the respect due historic documents.

39:31.253 --> 39:33.721
Newspapers from 1936?

39:34.723 --> 39:38.386
- All about the Danforth murder case!
- Are you all right?

39:38.427 --> 39:43.592
I was reading these when I went to bed!
By God, I did just dream it all!

39:43.632 --> 39:49.468
You're not all right. I have some black coffee
left over from breakfast. I'll heat it up for you.

40:05.821 --> 40:10.656
<i>The trouble with dreams is you can't tell
what in them is reality and what's fantasy.</i>

40:10.692 --> 40:14.184
<i>My subconscious had been
working overtime on the case</i>

40:14.229 --> 40:17.198
<i>and maybe, just maybe</i>
<i>had figured it out.</i> .. <i>maybe</i>.

40:17.232 --> 40:19.996
<i>There was only one sure way to find out</i>.

40:20.035 --> 40:23.266
- Rick. I'm sorry.
- Thomas, buddy, it's about time.

40:23.305 --> 40:27.969
It's a long story, but I think I got good news
for you, Cassie, about your grandfather.

40:28.010 --> 40:32.174
Thomas, look, it's OK.
You don't have to make any excuses to me.

40:32.214 --> 40:36.708
This was probably an impossible case
to solve in the time that you had.

40:36.752 --> 40:39.118
No, wait, I mean it.

40:39.154 --> 40:43.386
When your mother hired me
to save your grandfather, I start...

40:44.693 --> 40:48.424
- Thomas, are you OK?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

40:48.463 --> 40:53.298
I've been so wrapped up in trying to clear
Hank's name that when I went to sleep...

40:53.335 --> 40:56.532
You're exhausted, completely exhausted.

40:56.572 --> 41:02.238
Thomas, I'm sorry, all of this is my fault
because I pressured you into doing this

41:02.277 --> 41:05.269
because I only had enough money
to stay for a week.

41:05.314 --> 41:10.445
What I'm trying to explain is
that while I was sleeping,

41:10.485 --> 41:13.943
my mind must've still been working on the case

41:13.989 --> 41:17.481
because it sort of came to me
who really killed Danforth.

41:17.526 --> 41:22.691
You dreamed it? I said you were a great
investigator, but you dreamed the solution?

41:22.731 --> 41:27.896
Of course not. Well, not exactly.
See, actually, I did have this dream.

41:27.936 --> 41:30.302
Whatever it was, I know.

41:33.976 --> 41:36.103
Who? What's your proof?

41:36.144 --> 41:39.739
That's the only problem.
I don't have the proof yet.

41:57.099 --> 41:59.431
Mr. Danforth, Thomas Magnum.

41:59.468 --> 42:03.131
Magnum? I'm afraid
I don't know any Thomas Magnum.

42:03.171 --> 42:05.162
<i>I'm a private investigator, Drew</i>.

42:05.207 --> 42:09.234
<i>Hank McCutchen's granddaughter
hired me to help clear his name.</i>

42:12.481 --> 42:16.645
Well, in that case,
she's wasting her money and your time.

42:16.685 --> 42:20.348
Do you know how many left-wingers,
labor people and liberals

42:20.389 --> 42:25.292
have tried to prove
that McCutchen did not kill my father?

42:25.327 --> 42:27.295
They failed

42:27.329 --> 42:29.854
because McCutchen was as guilty as sin.

42:31.133 --> 42:33.294
So, if you don't mind...

42:33.335 --> 42:36.998
Well, see,
I've got something they didn't have.

42:39.074 --> 42:41.668
- Marisa.
- Marisa?

42:41.710 --> 42:46.807
<i>The letters your father wrote her, the papers
he signed for her, I know where they are.</i>

42:46.848 --> 42:49.681
<i>In the old cottage your family used to keep</i>.

42:49.718 --> 42:54.553
<i>I just thought that
you might be interested in buying them back.</i>

43:07.636 --> 43:10.161
<i>I was certain Drew would
remember the cottage.</i>

43:10.205 --> 43:12.765
<i>There were things I wasn't certain about</i> -

43:12.808 --> 43:16.141
<i>whether it was still standing
after 40 years and, if it was,</i>

43:16.178 --> 43:18.942
<i>whether the papers
Taft had signed were still there.</i>

43:18.980 --> 43:21.710
<i>Or more importantly,
whether they'd ever been there</i>

43:21.750 --> 43:25.015
<i>or anywhere except in my dream</i>.

43:25.887 --> 43:27.377
Down there?

43:27.422 --> 43:31.085
You want me to take you down there?
There's no place to land down there.

43:31.126 --> 43:34.653
Yes, there is.
Right over the next ridge.

43:34.696 --> 43:36.857
- You been here before?
- We both have.

43:36.898 --> 43:41.267
- You're cra <i>z</i> y. I ain't been here before.
- T.C., trust me.

43:51.713 --> 43:55.911
This time, if I don't come back,
don't you dare leave.

44:18.373 --> 44:21.774
<i>My heart was pounding,
my hands were sweating.</i>

44:21.810 --> 44:27.146
<i>My mind was telling me there was nothing
there, but my gut told me something else.</i>

45:05.220 --> 45:06.881
Magnum?

45:08.690 --> 45:10.851
Hello, Drew, it's been a long time.

45:12.127 --> 45:15.460
How do you know me?
How do you know about this place?

45:15.497 --> 45:20.264
Oh, I know a lot more about you
than you think. You want a sample?

45:21.269 --> 45:25.603
After you murdered your father,
you searched Marisa's house for these.

45:25.640 --> 45:30.270
When they weren't there, you broke into
your father's desk looking for 'em.

45:31.112 --> 45:35.242
Ruined the locks, scratched it all up.
Too bad. Such a nice piece...

45:35.283 --> 45:36.875
That's enough.

45:38.253 --> 45:41.051
The papers, put them on the step.

46:04.646 --> 46:05.635
Magnum!

46:16.691 --> 46:18.158
Hold it.

46:32.874 --> 46:35.934
Sorry, I only let people kill me once.

46:37.212 --> 46:41.148
You can tell me now.
How did you know the papers would be there,

46:41.182 --> 46:45.949
or that Danforth would come out there,
or that he shot the singer?

46:45.987 --> 46:49.787
Or that cra <i>z</i> y old man
would miss you when he shot at you?

46:49.824 --> 46:52.156
- It was all in my...
- No, no, no!

46:52.193 --> 46:54.957
Don't start with that dreaming stuff.

46:54.996 --> 46:58.454
- Just tell the truth. We're your pals.
- Yeah, that's right.

46:59.801 --> 47:00.961
OK.

47:01.002 --> 47:05.701
See, a private investigator
has to take chances.

47:05.740 --> 47:09.107
He has to rely on instincts,
make gut decisions.

47:09.144 --> 47:14.480
When I had all the facts, I reali <i>z</i> ed
there was only one possible decision

47:14.516 --> 47:18.452
that could satisfy my special intuition.

47:18.486 --> 47:19.475
OK?

47:20.522 --> 47:21.921
I knew it, I knew it.

47:23.058 --> 47:28.121
- You are the best.
- Yeah, I know, a peach of a detective.

47:28.163 --> 47:32.156
You bought that?
Man, he ain't that good. Come on.

47:32.200 --> 47:36.899
<i>Maybe every dream in paradise doesn't
have a happy ending, but this one did.</i>

47:36.938 --> 47:41.602
<i>For a good man,
for Cassie McCutchen and for me.</i>

47:41.643 --> 47:45.579
<i>The dream had been so real,
I wasn't sure I could switch back to reality,</i>

47:45.613 --> 47:51.415
<i>but Higgins and the guys were the same,
the sun was shining, the wind was cool.</i>

47:51.453 --> 47:54.479
<i>Things were back to normal in paradise</i>.
