WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.593
I only ever wished to offer you comfort.

00:01.617 --> 00:03.217
Comfort was not worth tasting.

00:03.297 --> 00:06.789
Temperance Yeardley told me
I must remarry. And quickly.

00:06.851 --> 00:09.285
Every instinct makes me fight
against such a confinement.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.620
I am sick

00:11.700 --> 00:14.447
of the likes of you vermin!

00:14.486 --> 00:16.660
You said I was...

00:16.740 --> 00:19.620
I've heard tell of men,
Master Massinger,

00:19.700 --> 00:20.700
made blind with rage.

00:20.780 --> 00:24.140
Tell the governor that you found
the secretary on his knees.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.820
It will make no difference.
He already possesses me.

00:26.900 --> 00:30.860
And that is why he refuses
to suspect you as the Spanish spy.

00:30.948 --> 00:33.374
No, he already knows who that is.

00:33.429 --> 00:35.589
Does it say if Governor Yeardley's
cargo was also lost?

00:35.620 --> 00:37.060
No, it doesn't say that.

00:37.140 --> 00:39.660
Ours is stolen, but his is safe.
In't that suspicious?

00:39.740 --> 00:42.860
If Yeardley believes he's seen
the last of the Sharrows' anger,

00:42.940 --> 00:44.220
then he will need new eyes.

Every working man in the town

00:57.620 --> 00:59.974
that cares about his livelihood,
gather round!

01:00.100 --> 01:02.460
A whole year's work! Robbed from us!

01:09.603 --> 01:14.194
Privateers, we're told.
Now, if our tobacco can go missing,

01:14.257 --> 01:15.944
then any man's can. Yeah?

01:15.983 --> 01:18.964
You dare to fire off your
musket in this settlement, Sharrow?

01:19.060 --> 01:22.380
We want to know why our tobacco
was stolen out at sea,

01:22.460 --> 01:24.500
- but our governor's was not.
- Yes.

01:24.580 --> 01:26.140
Yes!

01:26.220 --> 01:27.700
Is that right?

01:27.780 --> 01:31.661
The proper place for matters such as
this is the house of burgesses.

01:31.716 --> 01:35.638
Everyone knows how Yeardley
resents our prospering.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.060
The Spanish are coming.

02:08.588 --> 02:13.053
Philip the Papist has sent
a fleet of warships to attack us.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.660
They might be off our coast any day now.

02:17.254 --> 02:21.895
People of Jamestown,
we will soon be under siege!

02:22.220 --> 02:26.380
Every man amongst you
must prepare for battle.

02:27.860 --> 02:31.940
The marshal will order you into
readiness to defend our settlement.

02:32.363 --> 02:34.740
Our purpose here is holy.

02:35.900 --> 02:39.020
We fight with God on our side!

02:39.100 --> 02:40.340
Yes!

02:40.420 --> 02:43.780
Farmers from the farms close by must
gather inside the fortifications

02:43.860 --> 02:46.933
and remain here to make ready
to defend our colony.

02:46.996 --> 02:48.839
Yes!

04:14.756 --> 04:17.339
How the world doth darkle.

04:17.904 --> 04:20.019
A dispatch from God, Lady Yeardley.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.060
To warn us that menace draws near

04:22.140 --> 04:24.220
and that we must be ready to fight it.

04:26.060 --> 04:28.940
Don't it suit the governor
to have such news,

04:29.020 --> 04:32.591
when there is an uprising
on his own doorstep?

04:33.020 --> 04:34.498
What shall we do now, Henry?

04:34.630 --> 04:36.958
Silas. I know what this means.

04:37.013 --> 04:39.700
I've seen it before,
back at my home in England.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.185
Some terrible spirit is coming here.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.106
Aye.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.957
Governor, why is it the Spanish
should choose to invade us now?

05:02.059 --> 05:03.692
Because they have always
coveted our colony.

05:03.716 --> 05:06.012
So surely it is because
they have a spy amonst us.

05:06.059 --> 05:07.916
I do not understand why you
stand back from denouncing...

05:07.940 --> 05:10.100
We might soon be facing Spanish cannons.

05:10.180 --> 05:13.418
I do not need you snapping
at my heels, madam!

05:16.863 --> 05:20.500
Who is it? Keep away! You keep away!

05:20.580 --> 05:22.963
It's Mercy Myrtle, sir.

05:23.299 --> 05:25.789
Widow Castell's maid, and no one else.

05:27.340 --> 05:30.420
Mr Massinger. You can't see anything.

05:31.220 --> 05:33.140
The world's as black as hell.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.780
Sir, will you take my hand?

05:38.156 --> 05:39.660
Why will you help me?

05:40.021 --> 05:42.101
Why, sir? Because you need help.

05:58.875 --> 06:01.555
- To the blacksmith!
- Keep your eyes open, lads!

06:01.727 --> 06:03.820
We'll need swords, Read. And daggers.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.095
A call will go out for anything
that might be smelted,

06:06.172 --> 06:08.438
- and made into weapons or ammunition.
- I can forge swords, sir.

06:08.462 --> 06:10.017
But it'll be quicker to make halberds,

06:10.080 --> 06:12.720
and easier to use
for them that aren't skilled.

06:14.634 --> 06:17.282
Why do you look so contented,
Master Read?

06:17.360 --> 06:20.340
Something like this gives a man
a chance to prove himself.

06:20.420 --> 06:23.660
Prove himself to a king who hasn't
as much as set foot here,

06:23.740 --> 06:27.380
or to a governor who had you whipped
and hanged by your neck?

06:28.660 --> 06:31.620
You mean display your courage
to a woman.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.620
Your filthy face cannot hide
your chivalrous heart.

06:36.140 --> 06:38.386
Suppose a woman has
no call for chivalry?

06:39.771 --> 06:42.824
When I asked you to promise me
you wouldn't love me,

06:43.180 --> 06:45.700
it was not because you're a blacksmith.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.780
It's because you're a man.

06:54.104 --> 06:55.540
Verity.

06:56.980 --> 06:59.020
The black sun was a sign.

06:59.612 --> 07:01.420
Do you see anything strange about?

07:01.500 --> 07:04.260
Hell's teeth, woman. It's all strange.

07:04.450 --> 07:07.963
There's to be a war,
and here we are, fetchin' food.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.380
Look at them.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.700
Strutting cocks, the lot of them.

07:12.980 --> 07:15.894
Well, I want to be in.
Amongst the fighting.

07:15.948 --> 07:19.082
- Verity, you can't.
- Did you ever hear of Mary Ambree?

07:35.988 --> 07:39.708
In Congo, I was the best warrior
with a sword.

07:39.780 --> 07:43.460
Everybody knew it.
The Spanish will see it.

07:43.540 --> 07:46.180
I have heard tales
of the Spaniards' fighting men.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.420
Ruthless. Merciless.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.860
Vile torturers.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.020
I hope they will come soon.

07:57.420 --> 07:59.613
Close up the gates!

08:00.140 --> 08:01.918
Hold hard!

08:08.020 --> 08:09.860
What has become of him?

08:09.940 --> 08:12.420
As the sky went black, sir,
there he were,

08:12.467 --> 08:15.220
cursin' and roarin'
and strikin' at nothin'.

08:16.016 --> 08:18.576
I ain't never seen nothin' so pitiful.

08:18.820 --> 08:21.180
Pitiable. Pitying.

08:21.512 --> 08:23.222
Piteous.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.300
Sorrowful.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.540
Bring him to my apothecary, Mercy.

08:32.556 --> 08:37.659
Pedro, I have such frail blood,
cowardice is my only religion.

08:37.740 --> 08:41.860
I fear, as men die about me,
I will run like a cur.

08:42.940 --> 08:48.047
Pedro. You are a man of rare pluck.

08:48.922 --> 08:50.620
Where might I find the same?

08:50.700 --> 08:52.500
Shake your beard, Meredith Rutter!

08:52.580 --> 08:54.380
You're dying already

08:54.460 --> 08:57.273
from the creeping and crawling
around your own soul!

08:57.980 --> 09:00.820
Give death a slap, my friend.

09:02.648 --> 09:03.889
But how?

09:03.914 --> 09:06.613
Which men amongst you
will take the first night watch?

09:06.691 --> 09:10.460
I will, Marshal! I have
the best eyes in all of Virginia.

09:10.540 --> 09:12.700
And so will Master Rutter!

09:13.124 --> 09:15.484
My brave companion wishes
to show to Jamestown

09:15.544 --> 09:17.540
that he is a fearless warrior.

09:17.620 --> 09:22.020
If you are to be the watch, Rutter,
then you will be sober.

09:24.989 --> 09:28.980
Marshal. Did you ever hear
of Captain Mary Ambree?

09:29.060 --> 09:30.940
She fought boldly against the Spanish.

09:31.020 --> 09:33.300
Me ma sang me the ballad of it
at her knee.

09:33.380 --> 09:35.380
I wish to fight like her. Sir.

09:35.460 --> 09:38.020
You couldn't so much as lift a sword.

09:38.451 --> 09:41.399
I'll have no woman's
warm cake in my militia.

09:41.438 --> 09:43.500
Hah!

09:52.228 --> 09:55.660
It seems, sir, that the vital
spirits of your body have...

09:55.740 --> 09:59.175
boiled up like an earthquake
and attacked your every part.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.020
That is what has reached your eyes
and taken your sight away.

10:04.140 --> 10:06.340
I must have my eyes back.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.949
We'll try with a tincture
of mistletoe and peony.

10:11.700 --> 10:14.551
If that fails, Master Massinger,

10:15.100 --> 10:17.300
we must let blood from your head.

10:18.340 --> 10:21.540
I will pray for you, sir,
with all my living soul.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.399
Sir, I might pray better
if I had my hand free.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.480
If a ship comes, Rutter,

10:43.220 --> 10:47.515
it will advance from the river,
not from the woods.

10:47.562 --> 10:51.759
Yes, Secretary, but them Spaniards,
sir, they're known to be devious.

10:52.420 --> 10:54.180
Devious, Rutter.

10:54.260 --> 10:56.298
Not miraculous.

11:27.380 --> 11:29.700
Did you see him, Meredith?

11:30.860 --> 11:32.980
I saw something.

11:34.220 --> 11:35.950
Was it a man?

11:37.220 --> 11:39.700
He passed amongst
the graves there below.

12:08.300 --> 12:11.165
Silas. Silas, come and see.

12:13.340 --> 12:15.430
Look, there on the floor.

12:16.305 --> 12:20.245
Maggots. Maggots
are a sign of the walking dead.

12:43.242 --> 12:44.580
Ma'am?

12:47.060 --> 12:49.382
Ma'am?

13:41.906 --> 13:44.968
I smell perfume. Is it the widow?

13:44.993 --> 13:47.165
Mercy, take Master Massinger
outside for some air.

13:47.189 --> 13:48.507
Yes, ma'am.

13:50.427 --> 13:52.314
Here we go.

13:53.546 --> 13:55.906
Christopher, when I left
my wedding ring here with you,

13:55.986 --> 13:59.423
- what did you do with it?
- I placed it here.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.066
In this box.

14:11.026 --> 14:13.546
- It was beside me on the pillow.
- A trick.

14:14.546 --> 14:17.232
Someone attempting to torment you.

14:18.466 --> 14:21.378
Samuel has risen from the grave.

14:21.464 --> 14:24.506
Mistress Castell,
there is wild talk about the town

14:24.586 --> 14:27.066
that you witnessed a ghost abroad.

14:27.146 --> 14:29.946
Mercy saw the apparition
at the window. She said...

14:33.506 --> 14:35.341
She told me it was Samuel.

14:35.388 --> 14:38.746
Your maid spends half her life
in a state of fright or fantasy.

14:39.161 --> 14:41.786
There is no domain
between Earth and Heaven.

14:41.866 --> 14:43.106
It is a trick by Papists

14:43.186 --> 14:45.866
to herd the fearful
into their malicious embrace.

14:45.946 --> 14:48.746
I will not allow any talk
of spirits and demons

14:48.826 --> 14:49.986
as men prepare for battle.

14:50.066 --> 14:52.421
There'll be no mention of this.
Do you understand, Jocelyn?

14:52.504 --> 14:55.132
I fear it is too late for that,
Governor.

14:55.866 --> 14:57.703
Others saw it too.

14:58.135 --> 15:01.615
Hands! They attacked me by the throat.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.768
Claws, they were! Drizzling blood!

15:05.495 --> 15:06.775
I had to fight 'em off.

15:07.159 --> 15:09.919
Yeah, I saw no claws drizzling blood.

15:10.535 --> 15:14.388
That part of the affair Pedro did
not witness, for he looked away.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.855
What's this talk of spirits
walking amongst us, Rutter?

15:16.935 --> 15:18.810
Know this, Marshal...

15:19.386 --> 15:21.546
It weren't human. That's what.

15:22.815 --> 15:26.336
- Eyes like shrieks from Hell.
- I'll have none of it!

15:26.415 --> 15:29.235
You make the tale taller
with every telling, Rutter.

15:29.575 --> 15:33.608
My own mother's ghost lay beside me,
beneath my bedsheets,

15:33.686 --> 15:36.553
her hand upon my cheek,
every night for a month.

15:37.015 --> 15:39.815
That is why I came
to the other side of the globe.

15:47.495 --> 15:49.655
Men dream up spectres before their eyes

15:49.735 --> 15:52.055
when their senses are assailed
with fears and terrors.

15:52.135 --> 15:54.855
- Who will volunteer for the night watch?
- I will, Marshal.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.940
And my brave friend, Master Rutter.

15:57.454 --> 15:58.876
You're keen to boast you're not shaken

15:58.900 --> 16:00.940
by the fright of the dark, Rutter?

16:01.355 --> 16:03.144
You'll do.

16:13.012 --> 16:16.244
- What was it that you saw, Pedro?
- I was not afraid.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.322
But what did you see?

16:19.500 --> 16:21.900
Ma'am, I cannot trust
what my eyes told me in the dark.

16:21.980 --> 16:25.920
Well, you have the best eyes in
Virginia, Pedro, I heard you say.

16:28.660 --> 16:30.466
I saw Master Castell.

16:30.660 --> 16:32.940
But it was not him.

16:33.540 --> 16:37.039
It was only the dead corpse of the man.

16:37.260 --> 16:38.900
Walking.

16:40.020 --> 16:41.300
Walking.

16:47.620 --> 16:50.561
We had to rework swords and armoury
to make farm tools,

16:50.620 --> 16:53.020
cos the talk was all of land and peace.

16:53.389 --> 16:55.756
Show me how to make a sword, James Read.

16:59.300 --> 17:02.794
The fire, the billet,
the hammer and the anvil.

17:09.258 --> 17:12.180
We Sharrows are loyal Virginia men.

17:12.260 --> 17:14.420
But after this business
with the Spanish is done,

17:14.500 --> 17:15.969
we will be asking our governor

17:16.023 --> 17:18.453
what happened to our shipment
that went missing at sea.

17:18.531 --> 17:21.858
Do you doubt me, Sharrow?
Do you dare threaten me?

17:21.897 --> 17:23.980
Perhaps you will prefer to tell us, sir,

17:24.242 --> 17:27.260
why our tobacco was lost, and not yours.

17:27.339 --> 17:30.172
I see why you might arrive
at such a suspicion,

17:30.211 --> 17:32.540
but the explanation
might not be as convenient

17:32.620 --> 17:34.580
as you so clearly hope for.

18:25.740 --> 18:27.860
Life without eyes in this place.

18:28.902 --> 18:31.662
I wouldn't wish that on any man,
not even Massinger.

18:31.687 --> 18:32.980
Sure you would.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.873
Didn't Massinger tell me
he would do anything in his power

18:35.943 --> 18:38.020
to stop the Sharrows from prospering?

18:40.620 --> 18:43.020
Now, wouldn't that make sense of it?

18:43.100 --> 18:45.460
Massinger arranged with the captain
of the Royal Moon

18:45.540 --> 18:47.420
for our cargo of tobacco to be lost.

18:47.740 --> 18:50.980
That man said many times
how he wants to destroy you.

18:51.060 --> 18:53.982
Don't mean it was him
who had your cargo stolen.

18:55.340 --> 18:58.900
The confirmation of it might
come from the man himself.

19:01.244 --> 19:06.594
Mistress Castell, Pedro said it was
your husband he saw by the graves.

19:07.740 --> 19:10.492
Mercy witnessed the same
through the window.

19:10.820 --> 19:13.625
Alice, he left our wedding ring
on the pillow.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.260
What does it mean?

19:18.332 --> 19:21.692
I lived on a farm in the most
faroff corner of nowhere.

19:22.700 --> 19:25.460
Trees that shrouded the house
in darkness.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.740
Night owls calling low.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.260
My father said that when I was a child,

19:31.340 --> 19:33.740
I was touched
by a sense of things beyond.

19:34.660 --> 19:37.020
I heard such creaks and moans.

19:37.100 --> 19:40.655
I told him there was a spirit
attempting to come into our house.

19:41.020 --> 19:43.700
But then,
such strange apparitions came about

19:43.780 --> 19:46.842
as pots and pans would move
when no one touched them.

19:47.540 --> 19:50.712
When we saw the ghost, my uncle wept.

19:50.767 --> 19:52.900
Told us he recognised him.

19:52.980 --> 19:56.580
He admitted he'd stolen a purse
from a dying man by the roadside.

19:56.660 --> 20:00.337
He took some coins from it, burned
the love letter that was inside.

20:00.660 --> 20:03.580
And the next morning,
we found my uncle dead,

20:03.660 --> 20:06.260
his own knife in his eye
and his own hand upon it.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.540
This is a story of vengeance, Alice.

20:10.020 --> 20:12.179
That is why Samuel has returned.

20:12.380 --> 20:16.296
Because my toying with romance has
angered him from beyond the grave.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.460
No. No!

20:20.420 --> 20:23.316
Men try to possess me
even from beyond this world.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.613
What must I do, Alice?

20:27.715 --> 20:29.660
I've seen what such evil spirits can do.

20:29.740 --> 20:31.460
I will not let that happen again.

20:31.540 --> 20:34.214
We must banish the ghost.
Prevent him from returning.

20:34.315 --> 20:35.440
How?

20:35.526 --> 20:38.112
It's a foul business, ma'am,
but I will help you do it.

20:38.940 --> 20:41.598
We must ask James Read
to make us metal spikes

20:41.661 --> 20:43.588
with the sharpest points upon them.

20:55.104 --> 20:58.183
What do food taste of
to a blind man, sir?

20:59.471 --> 21:02.214
Food?

21:30.369 --> 21:33.391
When I take this blade
out of your mouth,

21:34.220 --> 21:36.540
you will tell me the dealings you've had

21:36.854 --> 21:38.774
with the captain of the Royal Moon.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.540
The arrangement that you made with him

21:40.620 --> 21:42.985
for our tobacco never to reach England.

21:43.016 --> 21:46.313
You speak, Master Massinger.

21:47.524 --> 21:49.868
While you still have
a tongue to speak with.

21:55.060 --> 21:57.860
Cut out me tongue. If you dare.

21:59.460 --> 22:01.780
What is this?

22:14.206 --> 22:17.006
Governor, we believe that this man
made corrupt dealings

22:17.079 --> 22:19.204
with a ship's captain
to steal away our profit.

22:19.300 --> 22:22.447
First you blame me,
then you accuse Master Massinger.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.602
Marshal, take him to the garrison.

22:34.943 --> 22:39.507
Do not make me prove to you
what kind of fighting man I am.

22:44.925 --> 22:48.005
Leave this business to me
to resolve as I see fit.

22:53.020 --> 22:55.780
He will not leave his grave
while they are there.

22:55.860 --> 22:57.540
You must do it with me, ma'am.

22:57.885 --> 23:00.365
He must know
that you refuse him returning.

23:06.180 --> 23:08.580
Why won't God let my master rest?

23:45.700 --> 23:48.020
You know what that is, Pedro?

23:50.700 --> 23:52.769
Darkness.

23:53.220 --> 23:56.332
In the darkness,
there is terror, that's what.

23:56.808 --> 23:59.153
You told me you wanted
to find your courage, Meredith.

23:59.231 --> 24:01.580
Yeah, and I want to lose it again.

24:01.660 --> 24:03.420
Don't you volunteer me no more.

24:03.895 --> 24:09.020
I mean, I might be bold enough if
I had a glass or two, but sober...

24:09.215 --> 24:11.140
Even the word of it is ugly.

24:12.100 --> 24:14.780
Sober. Sober.

24:16.940 --> 24:18.540
Sober.

24:22.060 --> 24:24.060
How is it that men like you, Pedro,

24:25.020 --> 24:27.500
or like James Read and the Sharrows,

24:27.580 --> 24:30.004
you can forego the drink,

24:30.260 --> 24:33.918
and the world is not made
of filth and fear to you?

24:37.860 --> 24:39.460
Pedro?

24:41.740 --> 24:42.820
Pedro?

24:43.940 --> 24:45.620
Pedro?

25:09.100 --> 25:11.100
Is someone there?

25:12.940 --> 25:14.900
Who is it?

25:15.460 --> 25:16.820
Speak!

25:16.845 --> 25:19.344
It is Maria.

25:19.980 --> 25:21.700
Maria, what are you doing about?

25:21.780 --> 25:25.220
Mistress Sharrow,
what are you doing about?

25:25.300 --> 25:27.900
Maria, I do admire your defiance.

26:03.780 --> 26:05.980
The spirit is about.

26:06.060 --> 26:09.100
The phantom will call
to Widow Castell's house.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.500
Why would you do such a thing, George?

27:07.580 --> 27:09.460
It does not say attack!

27:09.539 --> 27:11.441
It is only that the Spanish
are out to get here.

27:11.496 --> 27:15.300
It is only angry talk,
as it has been for years.

27:15.380 --> 27:19.565
Why has the whole town been put
into a state of fear and worry?

27:20.256 --> 27:24.256
Fields left untended.
Families huddled, afraid, at night.

27:25.700 --> 27:27.740
Since you have returned
this time, my dear,

27:27.820 --> 27:30.221
you have possessed
a new boldness about you.

27:30.300 --> 27:33.604
I plead with you,
as a devoted, obedient wife.

27:33.659 --> 27:35.667
See what is about you!

27:35.740 --> 27:38.220
The sun turned black!

27:38.273 --> 27:40.060
A man struck blind!

27:40.132 --> 27:42.652
Did we offend God?

27:42.740 --> 27:46.258
Sh, sh, sh, sh, my pet.
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

27:48.048 --> 27:50.688
Your difficulty does not lie
in the letter.

27:50.752 --> 27:54.525
It is your wish to read it that has
brought you to such a condition.

27:54.580 --> 27:58.460
I saw something in your face
as you made your pronouncement.

27:59.816 --> 28:02.696
Some delicate telltale sign of deceit.

28:02.750 --> 28:05.100
Then let me show you

28:05.180 --> 28:08.580
how you might know relief
from such anxieties.

28:10.020 --> 28:13.258
Never see such things in my face

28:13.353 --> 28:15.313
ever again.

28:29.580 --> 28:31.635
Someone's pulled them from the grave.

28:32.213 --> 28:34.338
Did you see anyone out there
last night, Pedro?

28:34.385 --> 28:36.665
No, Mistress Sharrow.

28:38.265 --> 28:40.392
I saw Maria about.

28:40.455 --> 28:42.013
You didn't notice her?

28:54.918 --> 28:57.731
Hold hard! Hold hard!

29:06.065 --> 29:09.625
When a man, a good man,

29:09.705 --> 29:13.737
dies a long way from home,
as a true Englishman,

29:13.776 --> 29:15.979
like Samuel Castell did,

29:16.237 --> 29:22.566
it is not unknown for a man's soul
to become susceptible to demons.

29:23.020 --> 29:26.260
The poor spirit might rail around
in the night, to plead for our aid.

29:26.344 --> 29:28.929
And I, for one, will not deny him.

29:29.007 --> 29:33.145
We will implore God for the
deliverance of our trusted recorder.

29:33.225 --> 29:37.989
And I know that all you true Christians

29:38.625 --> 29:41.005
will want to offer prayer.

29:43.305 --> 29:45.305
Led by my wife.

30:01.425 --> 30:04.225
We pray and beseech You, O Lord,

30:04.507 --> 30:07.147
as many as are here present,
with humble voice.

30:08.141 --> 30:11.221
You raise the dead to life
in the spirit.

30:11.283 --> 30:15.576
O Lord, have mercy
upon us miserable offenders.

30:15.825 --> 30:18.665
Deliver unto Heaven, O God,

30:18.745 --> 30:20.825
them that have lost their way.

30:20.905 --> 30:23.185
Restore them to Thy grace.

30:24.105 --> 30:25.945
In Christ Jesus, our Lord.

30:26.564 --> 30:28.183
Jesus have mercy.

30:30.905 --> 30:34.199
I myself will join the night watch.

30:34.261 --> 30:38.743
Let no man fear nor doubt
shades of the dark

30:39.505 --> 30:44.905
when our mettle is needed
to save this glorious colony.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.305
Take up your duties!

30:48.385 --> 30:51.505
We'll fight with every
last drop of Albion blood!

30:55.465 --> 30:57.985
Maria. Did you take the spikes
from the ground?

30:58.065 --> 30:59.737
No.

31:02.136 --> 31:03.588
Why do you believe me so easily,

31:03.635 --> 31:05.689
when I know you saw me in the night?

31:06.425 --> 31:08.425
Because you are Maria.

31:09.145 --> 31:12.025
It was the widow took the spikes
from the ground,

31:12.056 --> 31:14.625
because I told her it was a suffering

31:14.705 --> 31:17.225
for a spirit to be quiet
when he needs to speak.

31:24.787 --> 31:26.591
Ma'am?

31:28.505 --> 31:32.385
I couldn't help but see that when
James Read comforted you last night,

31:32.465 --> 31:34.305
the apparition's attack stopped.

31:34.385 --> 31:36.905
I do not believe the spirit's anger
is aimed at you.

31:36.985 --> 31:38.625
It seems he wants to shake you.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.905
Samuel was killed, but the true cause
of it is yet to be named.

31:42.985 --> 31:46.665
Our faith forbids any living soul
from speaking with a ghost, but...

31:46.745 --> 31:48.785
it seems we must do it.

31:53.981 --> 31:56.639
This sword is such a beauty, James.

31:58.185 --> 32:00.185
Might it be mine for the keeping?

32:02.905 --> 32:04.945
Will you teach me how to use it?

32:05.025 --> 32:07.305
I don't care what the marshal says.

32:07.385 --> 32:09.425
I ain't afraid of dying.

32:09.505 --> 32:12.945
And I ain't afraid of killin' any
would seek to trample us underfoot.

32:14.705 --> 32:16.545
Come here.

32:17.709 --> 32:20.429
All right. Grip the sword
in your strong hand,

32:20.476 --> 32:22.950
your other hand underneath it.

32:23.025 --> 32:26.121
Hold the sword here so the pommel's
away from your body.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.185
Then stab at the sky,

32:29.265 --> 32:34.204
left hand...
left hand past your eye, and then...

32:34.305 --> 32:36.265
down onto your foe.

32:36.337 --> 32:38.657
So, use the right hand
to guide the blade

32:38.745 --> 32:42.105
and the left hand
to set the force into it.

32:42.185 --> 32:43.825
Go on.

32:45.331 --> 32:49.200
Have you killed many men, James Read?

32:49.665 --> 32:52.465
It ain't the number that matters, Verity.

32:53.465 --> 32:55.913
It's the cry of a man put to the sword.

32:56.385 --> 32:58.545
That haunts you.

32:58.625 --> 33:00.585
It in't a sound I wish you to know.

33:00.665 --> 33:03.305
But if you want to fight,
that's the price.

33:35.225 --> 33:36.585
What did you say, man?

33:36.774 --> 33:39.254
If a man's manitou is here,

33:39.359 --> 33:41.505
it is because his life is not finished.

33:41.887 --> 33:45.529
There are deeds yet to do,
matters he must see.

33:45.609 --> 33:47.969
He cannot move away to the spirit world

33:48.049 --> 33:50.409
until his business is done.

33:50.489 --> 33:51.994
Is it likely, Governor,

33:52.057 --> 33:54.041
that the recorder wants
his killer to be named?

33:54.081 --> 33:56.588
When the frog tries to swallow the sun,

33:56.666 --> 33:58.761
it is a sign of things to come.

34:00.641 --> 34:04.765
He means, sirs, the eclipse
is a message of the ghost coming.

34:04.828 --> 34:05.857
My wife said the same thing.

34:05.881 --> 34:09.085
Here is the very reason we must not
sink to superstitions.

34:09.139 --> 34:11.039
It is pagan blasphemy.

34:11.109 --> 34:13.641
An eclipse is no more
than a shadow on the sun.

34:13.721 --> 34:15.641
Maggots mean maggots and nothing more.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.565
A broken window's a common occurrence.

34:17.620 --> 34:22.268
Fearful minds will see walking shades
in every shadow.

34:58.521 --> 35:01.071
When you are seen speaking Pamunkey
in the village,

35:01.096 --> 35:03.065
it brings suspicion upon you, Silas.

35:03.104 --> 35:05.245
Suspicion is not guilt.

35:05.521 --> 35:07.481
Tell that to the hangman.

35:17.341 --> 35:19.021
If he appears, I will address him.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.260
He must understand
that we will help him,

35:21.340 --> 35:23.508
but he cannot remain here.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.380
Perhaps the master won't come.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.700
I don't believe he will come.

35:29.780 --> 35:32.091
Don't the fire crackle
with a ghostly crickcrack?

35:32.153 --> 35:34.860
- It never crackled like that before.
- Hush, child.

35:34.940 --> 35:38.060
I'm only saying, ma'am, that I
don't think the spirit will return,

35:38.140 --> 35:39.483
because that's what I hope,

35:39.534 --> 35:42.037
and sometimes it is best
to believe what you hope,

35:42.300 --> 35:45.060
because, ma'am,
there he is at the window.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.200
It is James Read.

35:49.247 --> 35:51.060
I shall send him away.

35:51.140 --> 35:53.580
He likely wants
to serve as our guardian.

35:56.340 --> 36:00.260
I wanted only to say
that if this is my doing,

36:00.340 --> 36:02.260
if what happened between us
is the reason

36:02.340 --> 36:05.063
that your husband has returned
to torment you,

36:05.620 --> 36:08.020
then I will face any demon.

36:09.220 --> 36:10.540
Sometimes I look at you

36:10.612 --> 36:13.492
and I want to take your hand
and lead you into the night again.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.940
But you can't,

36:22.780 --> 36:26.161
- cos you are to marry the doctor.
- I intend to live as a widow.

36:27.180 --> 36:30.220
I think you'll find that the
governor has other ideas on that.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.100
Hey, Governor.

37:02.740 --> 37:04.740
I see nothing, Pedro.

37:56.049 --> 37:58.283
Sing all you like, Yeardley.

37:58.580 --> 38:01.830
It's your own conscience
at you scratching.

38:02.140 --> 38:06.154
The captain of the Royal Moon
is known as the corruptible kind.

38:06.532 --> 38:08.568
When I saw you enjoying his company,

38:08.620 --> 38:11.498
I asked Recorder Castell
to keep a watch on you both.

38:12.380 --> 38:16.220
- He did not live to make that report.
- Even a blind man can see...

38:17.460 --> 38:20.620
- you have no evidence.
- Did you arrange with the captain

38:20.700 --> 38:24.420
to have the Sharrows' tobacco
lost at sea?

38:26.740 --> 38:29.740
And was it in exchange
for you offering some favours

38:29.820 --> 38:33.340
to that Spanish adder,
the Count of Gondomar?

38:33.420 --> 38:35.420
I have no eyes, Governor.

38:36.938 --> 38:38.360
Come closer.

38:39.124 --> 38:40.806
Come closer...

38:41.820 --> 38:44.940
that I might bite off your face.

38:47.060 --> 38:49.260
I'm waiting for the captain's return,

38:49.340 --> 38:51.540
so that I might ply him with rum,

38:51.620 --> 38:53.740
put a blade to his throat,

38:53.820 --> 38:55.980
and have him speak your name.

39:31.780 --> 39:33.940
I came to implore you.

39:34.060 --> 39:37.660
It is only spirits of evil who
create the illusion of ghosts.

39:37.723 --> 39:41.585
You must, I beg you, by no means
communicate with the shade.

39:41.632 --> 39:45.700
Whether or not the demon speaks
for God or the devil, I know this.

39:45.780 --> 39:47.700
He will return each and every night

39:47.780 --> 39:49.820
until such time as his call is heard

39:49.900 --> 39:52.140
and his slayer is named.

39:52.392 --> 39:54.832
There is a means by which
we can have Samuel himself

39:54.913 --> 39:58.180
tell us who it was that took his life.

39:59.140 --> 40:01.100
Cruentation.

40:01.412 --> 40:03.260
Cruentation?

40:03.340 --> 40:07.500
The ceremony of touching
the dead man's body.

40:20.347 --> 40:22.019
What is this cruentation, Alice?

40:22.059 --> 40:24.808
Because the soul
speaks through the blood,

40:25.082 --> 40:28.993
if the murderer lays his hand
upon the corpse of his victim,

40:29.134 --> 40:30.509
that body will bleed.

40:30.564 --> 40:32.844
And so God's verdict is declared.

40:51.789 --> 40:53.612
Guards!

41:00.945 --> 41:03.945
Lay your hand upon the body,
Master Massinger.

41:34.825 --> 41:36.825
There is no blood.

41:39.242 --> 41:42.105
Governor, are we to let this declare
Massinger is innocent?

41:42.185 --> 41:44.031
Let the widow do the same.

41:44.117 --> 41:48.268
Let us see if she
is as free of guilt as I am.

41:50.505 --> 41:52.345
Will she dare?

41:54.985 --> 41:56.985
Mistress Castell?

42:02.449 --> 42:03.865
The Spanish are upon us!

42:15.234 --> 42:19.101
- Hold fast!
- Hold your fire, you damn fools!

42:26.793 --> 42:28.513
It looks like the Royal Moon.

42:30.222 --> 42:32.571
It flies an English flag.

42:32.753 --> 42:35.314
An ensign cannot always be trusted, sir.

42:35.633 --> 42:38.486
One ship alone is not a Catholic attack.

42:41.273 --> 42:44.393
Lay down your arms. A friendly ship.

42:54.993 --> 42:57.542
This letter contains welcome news.

42:58.011 --> 43:00.833
Escort the good captain
to the assembly hall.

43:00.913 --> 43:03.890
Stand down the militia!
The Spanish threat is ended.

43:03.961 --> 43:06.673
Was there ever truly
a Spanish threat, Governor?

43:06.753 --> 43:10.073
Men have had their arms broken for
saying less than that, Sharrow.

43:10.153 --> 43:11.793
We have business to conclude.

43:19.393 --> 43:22.536
Mercy, you must fetch
something for me. Quickly.

43:34.913 --> 43:37.673
It will only bleed if the hand
that killed him touches it.

43:37.753 --> 43:39.348
That is so.

43:53.873 --> 43:56.162
I see no blood.

44:00.585 --> 44:02.248
Master Massinger,

44:02.303 --> 44:05.201
we would have you place your hand
on the corpse once more.

44:06.227 --> 44:09.267
What trick is this?
The whole town is here to witness

44:09.347 --> 44:11.827
that no false claim
be made against you, sir.

44:13.397 --> 44:16.321
You must do as the governor bids,
Master Massinger.

44:20.787 --> 44:24.507
You failed to prove
any guilt upon me once already.

44:25.467 --> 44:27.947
What have I to fear?

45:11.467 --> 45:13.188
Blood.

45:14.176 --> 45:16.039
Blood.

45:20.286 --> 45:22.326
Damn you!

45:23.522 --> 45:25.722
You vile widow!

45:26.227 --> 45:28.230
Damn you, Yeardley.

45:28.427 --> 45:30.664
Pox butcher of Virginia.

45:31.227 --> 45:33.141
Yes!

45:35.267 --> 45:38.992
I cut the throat
of your primping recorder.

45:43.072 --> 45:45.375
And I fed him to the birds.

45:52.507 --> 45:54.883
Arrest the captain of the Royal Moon!

45:54.962 --> 45:58.168
Massinger's cohort
in this rotten business.

45:58.193 --> 45:59.873
Be still!

46:06.567 --> 46:09.317
Was it you had our cargo stolen,
Massinger?

46:09.379 --> 46:11.778
Tell us, man, before you die.

46:12.507 --> 46:14.590
That is my final curse on you Sharrows,

46:14.653 --> 46:16.507
that you should never know
if it is true.

46:16.587 --> 46:19.187
The captain of the Royal Moon
will tell us.

46:25.787 --> 46:27.797
Thank you, child.

46:32.191 --> 46:35.107
I know that you know, Jocelyn,
that the bleeding from his nose

46:35.187 --> 46:37.067
was caused by his collar.

46:38.227 --> 46:42.107
Not by God,
nor a ghost pointing to his guilt.

46:42.187 --> 46:45.107
Do you suppose I have magical gifts,
Christopher?

46:45.960 --> 46:48.594
How might I make a man's nose bleed?

47:23.347 --> 47:25.627
I will wait for you in Hell, Yeardley.

47:58.467 --> 47:59.787
Bury him.

48:09.329 --> 48:11.587
What will become
of Massinger's land, Governor?

48:11.667 --> 48:13.368
The man is not yet in the ground.

48:13.461 --> 48:16.344
Have at least the pretence
of dignity about you, Sharrow.

48:39.507 --> 48:41.426
Verity.

48:42.251 --> 48:44.811
The deed is done.
We must open up the tap.

48:45.587 --> 48:48.427
Will you let the man
have a moment's pity over him?

48:49.827 --> 48:51.947
Even Massinger deserves that.

49:07.580 --> 49:10.477
Let me be! Let me be, let me be!

50:10.174 --> 50:12.436
It is like the cry of an owl.

50:48.082 --> 50:51.701
You Sharrows are known
as masterly hunters.

50:53.427 --> 50:55.482
You will track the Negro down

50:55.545 --> 50:57.607
if you wish me to favour your petition.

51:00.107 --> 51:02.307
What have you beneath those blankets,
James Read?

51:02.473 --> 51:05.667
We have a chance to get back
what we have lost.

51:05.747 --> 51:08.005
I will not give Maria up.

51:08.052 --> 51:10.347
The more they seek to shame me,

51:10.427 --> 51:13.782
the more I refuse to be tamed.
