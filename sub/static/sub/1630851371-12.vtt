Faith Evans!
Welcome to the Group B finals.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.560
Yeah!

00:28.996 --> 00:34.134
Men in black,
go check that out.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.379
Your versatility
knows no bounds.

00:45.379 --> 00:50.517
Probably one of my favorite
performances ever on this show.

00:50.517 --> 00:53.120
Whoa! So good.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.156
<i>Only one will face
the Bull in the finale.</i>

00:56.156 --> 00:57.791
<i>For the other, it's...</i>

00:57.791 --> 01:00.594

Welcome to "The Masked Singer"
and our Group B finals.

01:30.123 --> 01:36.563
Are you guys as excited as I am?
Ow! Oh, yeah.

01:36.563 --> 01:39.099
And then there were two,

01:39.099 --> 01:43.637
Banana Split
and Queen of Hearts.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.874
Oh, it's gonna be good.
It's gonna be good.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.976
Tonight's winner
will go mask‐to‐mask

01:48.976 --> 01:52.779
against our Group A winner
the Bull.

01:52.779 --> 01:57.451
That's right.
We are just seven days away
from our season finale.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.352
What?

01:58.352 --> 02:01.121
But first,
here's how tonight works.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.123
Both Banana Split
and Queen of Hearts

02:03.123 --> 02:06.326
will perform
one solo performance
and one duet.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.829
The singers' duet partners
are some young upstarts

02:08.829 --> 02:11.031
we found hanging around
the parking lot.

02:11.031 --> 02:13.267
A guy by the name
of Robin Thicke.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.969
‐ Nice! Yeah!
‐ Yeah!

02:15.969 --> 02:17.337
‐ Yeah, let's go!
‐ We're doing this.

02:17.337 --> 02:18.839
‐Let's go!
‐ We're doing this.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.041
‐ Let's go.
‐ Yes!

02:21.041 --> 02:24.611
And a super talented,
gorgeous young lady,

02:24.611 --> 02:26.213
uh, Nicole Scherzinger.

02:26.213 --> 02:32.286
‐ Yeah!
‐ Come on! Come on!

02:32.286 --> 02:35.122
How did it take us,
like, six seasons

02:35.122 --> 02:36.657
to get to hear you guys sing?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.926
Well, there was a lot
of singers on the show.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.128
That makes sense.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.830
Yo, it's about time.
I'm so excited.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.233
Well, since
we're already talking to them,
let's give it up for them.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.335
Make some noise for our panel,

02:48.335 --> 02:52.005
the best‐looking
and most amazing panel on TV.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.875
Who raised you?
Get off the furniture!

02:54.875 --> 02:56.610
All right, all right.
Sorry, Daddy.

02:56.610 --> 03:00.347
Farrah Fawcett flip!
Super fly right there.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.882
And speaking of super fly,

03:01.882 --> 03:03.951
give it up for my man
Robin Thicke.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.085
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

03:05.085 --> 03:10.924
I sat and you mocked me,
and he sat and you praise him?

03:10.924 --> 03:12.759
You kinda, like, sprawled.

03:12.759 --> 03:15.696
‐ Sit your butt down, Ken.
‐ Okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.899
All right, let's get
this clash of titans started.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.001
You guys ready?

03:21.001 --> 03:24.371
We're kicking things off
with Banana Split.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.679
It's almost impossible
to not hear the things
that people will say about you.

03:32.713 --> 03:36.750
I mean,
in the world that we live in,
it's kind of everywhere.

03:36.750 --> 03:41.388
People say I'm fame obsessed,
like I'm an egomaniac.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.690
I've heard people say
I'm not very bright

03:43.690 --> 03:46.660
but at least I'm pretty,
like that makes it hurt less.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.062
Sometimes it can feel like
the weight of the world really.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.366
It can dampen your self esteem,
and it kinda makes you
question everything.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.034
It feels like they've been
through a lot together.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.336
‐Yeah.
‐ The critics,
they can be cruel.

03:56.370 --> 03:59.239
But when we're performing,
we shut out the noise.

03:59.239 --> 04:03.076
‐ The static is gone.
‐ Windy City? I know that.

04:03.076 --> 04:08.815
And for that moment,
nothing else matters.

04:08.815 --> 04:11.985
Yeah, together we know
that we can get through
any kind of storm.

04:11.985 --> 04:17.791
Oh, you cheese ball.
I think I saw a kiss at the end.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.561
‐ A Banana Split kiss.

‐ We've never had tap dancing.

06:24.918 --> 06:29.623

06:38.165 --> 06:40.300
Only on
"The Masked Singer."

06:40.300 --> 06:42.102
First of all, Miss Thing,

06:42.102 --> 06:45.806
every week, like, your vocals
sound like a record.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.174
They're always perfect.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.576
And, Banana,
you know how much we love you.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.745
We know that you're the genius
behind the mask,

06:51.745 --> 06:55.082
and together you are the light
of our show this season.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.084
So thank you so much.
We love you.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.620
Yes. Absolutely.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.356
Honestly, the Banana is one
of my favorite characters

07:02.356 --> 07:04.625
‐ in "Masked Singer" history.
‐ Wow! Ken!

07:04.625 --> 07:07.060
I can attest.
He will not stop talking
about Banana.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.963
I hang every word
the Banana says,

07:09.963 --> 07:12.699
and that's why you are
a perfect duo. Amazing.

07:12.699 --> 07:16.069
I feel like one day you should
do a duet with Banana.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.106
I would be‐‐
I would be honored,

07:19.106 --> 07:21.108
but I gotta work
on my own terms.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.110
I don't like to get up
before noon,

07:23.110 --> 07:24.611
and I like to have a big limo
shovel me in.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.381
‐ I need
a certain temperature...
‐ No. Ken, Ken?

07:27.381 --> 07:29.149
Yep. Yes, sir.
I don't get to talk very much,

07:29.149 --> 07:32.586
but I think I can
make you sound great.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.622
‐Ooh.
‐Is he a producer?

07:35.622 --> 07:39.560
That is the highest compliment
I've ever received in my life.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.094
Thank you.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.629
‐ From a talking fruit.
‐In my life.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.900
All right, well, tonight
we'll be gifted a t‐shirt

07:46.900 --> 07:49.069
with a one‐word clue
from our singers

07:49.069 --> 07:51.605
that is a connection to one
of our panelists actually.

07:51.605 --> 07:55.742
‐ Ooh.
‐ But how do I get it
to our panel?

07:55.742 --> 08:00.881
Get excited, y'all.
Because it's the return...

08:00.881 --> 08:05.018
...of the Nick Cannon Cannon.

08:05.018 --> 08:08.155
‐ Yes!
‐ Bring it out, men in black!

08:08.155 --> 08:11.291
‐ I love the Nick Cannon Cannon.
‐ I mean, really?

08:11.291 --> 08:13.927
Who doesn't love
the Nick Cannon Cannon?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.229
Are you guys ready?

08:15.229 --> 08:17.865
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah!
‐ Yes, sir.

08:17.865 --> 08:21.235
All right,
this one's for Nicole.

08:21.235 --> 08:23.003
‐Oh, it's gonna‐‐
‐Oh, be careful.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.204
‐ Be careful.
‐Oh, wow.

08:24.204 --> 08:29.776
‐ What does it say here?
‐All right.

08:29.776 --> 08:34.882
Oh. Madison Square
Garden maybe! Ah!

08:34.882 --> 08:40.220
Nicole, I love when
you plant a little seed,

08:40.220 --> 08:41.955
and then you watch it grow

08:41.955 --> 08:46.193
and do great things over
the years. Oh, Nicole.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.395
I think he said
some key words there.

08:48.395 --> 08:51.031
So, Nicole, were you
picking up on anything?

08:51.031 --> 08:53.834
Yeah, I'm trying
not to cry right now.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.202
Aw, you're gonna make me cry.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.204
Yeah, Banana went
for the heartstrings.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.640
I didn't expect to cry,
like‐‐ whoo!

08:59.640 --> 09:03.944
Um, I got my start
on a show called "Popstars."

09:03.944 --> 09:07.014
And I had a very famous
big time producer

09:07.014 --> 09:09.616
on the show by the name
of David Foster.

09:09.616 --> 09:14.288
‐ Oh!
‐Who mentored us
and discovered us.

09:14.288 --> 09:18.225
And just recently he produced me
with Andrea Bocelli.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.361
And Andrea Bocelli
and I performed
at Madison Square Garden

09:21.361 --> 09:23.697
which,
thanks to David Foster,
brought us together.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.366
‐ That's amazing!
‐I agree with Nicole.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.101
I mean, they had a clue,
the Windy City.

09:28.101 --> 09:32.005
David Foster saved
the group Chicago.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.208
He reinvented their sound.

09:34.208 --> 09:37.344
Basically,
he is a perfect producer.

09:37.344 --> 09:42.182
And I do feel that the Split
is Katharine McPhee, who‐‐ Yes.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.385
I've had the pleasure of working
with Katharine on "Community."

09:45.385 --> 09:47.354
And plus, the fact
that they're a couple,

09:47.354 --> 09:51.058
it's gotta be David Foster
and Katharine McPhee.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.360
How amazing would that be?

09:53.360 --> 09:56.196
That level of talent
on our show?

09:56.196 --> 09:58.999
‐ It would be insane.
‐ Let me interject here.

09:58.999 --> 10:02.069
When I was born,
David Foster and my father
were best friends, right?

10:02.069 --> 10:03.136
So I grew up with Uncle David.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.073
Let me tell you why
this is not David Foster.

10:06.073 --> 10:09.042
‐ It's not Uncle Dave?
‐ Let me tell you why
that's not Uncle Dave.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.777
Oh, I'm getting my popcorn
out right now.

10:10.777 --> 10:14.047
Because Uncle Dave is so proud
of himself and his work,

10:14.047 --> 10:17.317
he would never come
on this show as a Banana. Oh!

10:17.317 --> 10:20.120
He'd come on as a yacht
or a helicopter,

10:20.120 --> 10:22.289
killer whale, or something.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.625
No, no, but seriously,
I still think it could be

10:24.625 --> 10:27.094
a great collaborative
producer/singer team.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.963
‐ Right.
‐ Like a Ryan Tedder,
Leona Lewis.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.231
Ryan Tedder's
from "OneRepublic."

10:31.231 --> 10:33.800
‐ He writes for Adele.
He plays drums, piano.
‐Epic.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.902
‐ Absolutely.
‐There it is.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.638
All right, our clue expert.
Jenny, what you got?

10:37.638 --> 10:41.308
You know, I'm all over
the place a little bit

10:41.308 --> 10:44.978
even though I think Nicole
and Ken are onto something.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.648
But I saw the Windy City
license plate

10:47.648 --> 10:50.918
and it actually
made me think of Richard Gere
and Catherine Zeta‐Jones.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.953
You know, 'cause
they performed in "Chicago."

10:52.953 --> 10:55.689
But then they kissed
in the package,

10:55.689 --> 10:58.759
and that made think
it's gotta be a couple.

10:58.759 --> 11:02.930
So I'm sticking
with Jeff Goldblum
and his wife Emily.

11:02.930 --> 11:06.233
‐There we go.
‐Interesting.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.168
All I know is
you guys were a blast,

11:08.168 --> 11:10.204
and I can't wait to see
you guys perform again.

11:10.204 --> 11:12.573
We are in the presence
of greatness.

11:12.573 --> 11:17.277
Banana Split, go ahead
and head backstage
and ice yourself off.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.747
Aw, they're so great.

11:20.747 --> 11:25.319
Hey there, Banana Split.
It's your BFF/doc, Dr. Phil.

11:25.319 --> 11:28.989
It is so much fun watching you
on "Masked Singer."

11:28.989 --> 11:31.124
As for the audience
and you judges,

11:31.124 --> 11:34.228
you might need a lot
of therapy after this,

11:34.228 --> 11:37.998
and I ain't cheap,
so good luck to you too.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.900
<i>Coming up,</i>

11:39.900 --> 11:42.336
<i>the battle
for the finals continues.</i>

11:42.336 --> 11:44.938
This is the greatest show ever.

11:44.938 --> 11:49.877
<i>And for the first time ever,
Robin and Nicole take the stage
for a pair of epic duets.</i>

11:49.877 --> 11:51.411
‐ Yeah!
‐ <i>And later...</i>

11:51.411 --> 11:55.282
One of the most
competitive races we've had
in "Masked Singer" history.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.318

12:20.965 --> 12:24.335
Up next is her majesty,
Queen of Hearts.

12:28.973 --> 12:33.545
For my entire life,
I wanted to have
a sense of community,

12:33.545 --> 12:39.584
and I found it in some really
unusual and unexpected places.

12:39.584 --> 12:40.985
There was definitely a time
in my life

12:40.985 --> 12:42.887
when I was living
like an animal.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.790
My primary concerns
were where to get food,

12:45.790 --> 12:47.592
where to get shelter
that was safe.

12:47.592 --> 12:50.428
‐ Wow.
‐ Oh, that's a devil.
Red devil.

12:50.428 --> 12:52.831
I remember this one time
I was walking down the street,

12:52.831 --> 12:54.532
and I was really losing hope.

12:54.532 --> 12:56.901
And this man I passed by,
he looked at me,

12:56.901 --> 13:00.572
and darn it if that man
did not reach into his pocket

13:00.572 --> 13:02.874
and hand me out a $5 bill.

13:02.874 --> 13:05.710
Knowing that he wanted me
to eat that night,

13:05.710 --> 13:07.045
‐ it just meant the world.
‐ Wow.

13:07.045 --> 13:10.181
Look at your own life,
and you go, "I gotta
stop complaining."

13:10.181 --> 13:12.717
I've gotten to see life
from both sides now,

13:12.717 --> 13:16.321
real poor and real wealthy,
and I still gotta say,

13:16.321 --> 13:23.595
it is the poorest people
who are the most generous.

13:23.595 --> 13:26.097
She's gone through so much.

I mean, all hail the queen,

15:37.395 --> 15:43.368
Like, probably one
of my favorite performances
ever on this show.

15:43.368 --> 15:46.504
There's a reason
that you're the Heart.

15:46.504 --> 15:49.474
You're like the blood in our
veins to our heart right now
through that performance.

15:49.474 --> 15:52.577
‐ Thank you so much.
‐Absolutely.

15:52.577 --> 15:56.948
It's one thing
just as a fan of music
to enjoy performance,

15:56.948 --> 16:02.220
but it's another thing
to feel it, and God bless you.

16:02.220 --> 16:09.561
We're just honored to be

Y'all, I am shaking

Okay, I'm pulling it together.

16:20.939 --> 16:23.007
So that's
a heartfelt performance.

16:23.007 --> 16:25.944
Extremely powerful, but before
we get to the guessing,

16:25.944 --> 16:27.846
I'm sure the panel
needs some help.

16:27.846 --> 16:33.518
Men in black, bring out
the Nick Cannon Cannon.

16:33.518 --> 16:36.955
Yeah! Come on!

16:36.955 --> 16:39.624
‐ I'm ready!
‐ You think you're so cool
with that cannon.

16:39.624 --> 16:44.696
All right, Ken,
this one's for you. Oh, for me?

16:44.696 --> 16:45.997
‐ Oh, oh!
‐ Where is it?

16:45.997 --> 16:49.501
There it is, Ken.
- There it is,
- Thank you.

16:49.501 --> 16:50.935
Wrestle.

16:50.935 --> 16:53.838
Huh. Did you do
"WrestleMania" or something?

16:53.838 --> 16:55.907
Well, Queen of Hearts
can help us out.

16:55.907 --> 16:59.777
So I'm not afraid, like you,

16:59.777 --> 17:03.148
to get in the ring and get
a little bit "dirrrty."

17:03.148 --> 17:04.549
‐ Ooh!
‐ "Dirrrty."

17:04.549 --> 17:08.653
‐Dirty.
‐ Did you get dirty with
the Queen of Hearts, Ken?

17:08.653 --> 17:11.723
First of all,
don't tell my wife.

17:11.723 --> 17:15.693
Second of all,
I was on "WWE Raw."

17:15.693 --> 17:18.596
Is "dirty"
a Christina Aguilera reference?

17:18.596 --> 17:19.831
It's‐‐ I think that's right.

17:19.831 --> 17:22.433
Did you have a fling
with Christina Aguilera?

17:22.433 --> 17:25.703
I did not have a fling.

17:25.703 --> 17:27.906
Your face turned as red
as that shirt.

17:27.906 --> 17:29.841
I know. I know. Why am I‐‐

17:29.841 --> 17:34.445
Oh! That's amazing!

17:34.445 --> 17:36.648
All right, back to the clues.

17:36.648 --> 17:41.386
I don't know
if Christina Aguilera
had guested on "WWE Raw."

17:41.386 --> 17:42.887
And the way she said "dirty,"

17:42.887 --> 17:46.391
all that reminds me of X‐tina
because she's‐‐

17:46.391 --> 17:48.726
Is that what
you call her? X‐tina?
That's your little nickname?

17:48.726 --> 17:51.830
Yes, Christina is
a family friend, Nick Cannon.

17:51.830 --> 17:52.931
We carpool to work.

17:52.931 --> 17:57.569
When she recorded
her last album,
I was her ride.

17:57.569 --> 17:59.571
Oh, my God.

17:59.571 --> 18:02.307
Could you sit
your "Genie in a Bottle"
ass down, please?

18:02.340 --> 18:05.710
Yes! Thank you, Nick.
Thank you, Nick.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.913
Christina could pull that off.
That's for sure.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.615
‐ Christina could pull it off.
‐She could pull it off.

18:10.615 --> 18:11.850
And she sang in French
a couple weeks ago.

18:11.850 --> 18:12.851
She did
the "Moulin Rouge" thing.

18:12.851 --> 18:14.352
She's an amazing singer,

18:14.352 --> 18:17.722
but if I'm going off
of some of the clues this week,

18:17.722 --> 18:19.457
I saw a devil.
Did y'all see a red devil?

18:19.457 --> 18:20.859
‐ I did.
‐We did.

18:20.859 --> 18:25.663
This artist sang the theme song
to "Devil Wears Prada."

18:25.663 --> 18:26.898
KT Tunstall.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.267
‐Oh, yeah.
‐Oh.

18:29.267 --> 18:32.170
"Suddenly I See," people, okay?
"Suddenly I See."

18:32.170 --> 18:33.571
That's a good name.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.306
But we take it back,
last time,

18:35.306 --> 18:37.609
I think they won a
Blockbuster Movie Award, right?

18:37.609 --> 18:38.877
Right.

18:38.877 --> 18:40.845
Now the era of
the Blockbuster Movie Award,

18:40.845 --> 18:45.350
it was the time of
the Lilith Fair, right?

18:45.350 --> 18:46.584
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐Do we remember
the Lilith Fair?

18:46.584 --> 18:47.685
I love Lilith Fair. Yeah.

18:47.685 --> 18:50.955
So I'm thinking Sarah McLachlan,
Natalie Merchant,

18:50.955 --> 18:54.459
Joan Osborne,
and you know what? Paula Cole.

18:54.459 --> 18:57.996
"Where Have All
the Cowboys Gone," people?

18:57.996 --> 18:59.931
What are you,
an MTV VJ right now?
What's going on here, Nicole?

18:59.931 --> 19:03.701
I'm helping them out
for the bobble heads, Ken.

19:03.701 --> 19:06.838
But you know who else was from
the Lilith Fair as well? Who?

19:06.838 --> 19:07.972
I know
I said this before,

19:07.972 --> 19:09.707
but I'm hearing it in the voice.

19:09.707 --> 19:12.744
I've been feeling it
for a little bit now.

19:12.744 --> 19:15.280
‐ Jewel.
‐Oh.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.550
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Did Jewel go to
"WrestleMania" or‐‐

19:18.550 --> 19:20.752
Probably.
Jewel does everything, Ken.

19:20.752 --> 19:22.587
Well, whoever you are,

19:22.587 --> 19:23.922
Queen of Hearts,
you were just incredible.

19:23.922 --> 19:25.790
I don't know who
is gonna win tonight,

19:25.790 --> 19:27.859
but you going up
against the Bull

19:27.859 --> 19:29.761
could be one of the best finals
we've ever had.

19:29.761 --> 19:32.964
So thank you so much.
Absolutely.

19:32.964 --> 19:35.166
Y'all keep it going
for Queen of Hearts.

19:35.166 --> 19:42.440
She did amazing.
Now head on backstage.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.508
This is a hard one.

19:43.508 --> 19:44.943
Two of the best
that we've ever seen,

19:44.943 --> 19:46.911
the Queen of Hearts
or Banana Split.

19:46.911 --> 19:48.947
Banana Split,
they're entertainers.

19:48.947 --> 19:51.716
‐ They put on a good show.
‐ They do both, yeah.

19:51.716 --> 19:53.852
And then Queen of Hearts
just tugs at your heartstrings.

19:53.852 --> 19:55.987
‐Right.
‐ This is gonna be a battle.

19:55.987 --> 20:00.425
All right, will Queen of Hearts
have a Golden Mask trophy

20:00.425 --> 20:01.926
to go along with her tiara?

20:01.926 --> 20:03.428
Hold on for a second.
Time out.

20:03.428 --> 20:05.897
What? What? You're interrupting
my throw to commercial.

20:05.897 --> 20:08.633
Let me tell you this.
He thinks he's so cool.

20:08.633 --> 20:13.838
Every time we're in the back,
all you do is brag about
your t‐shirt cannon.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.774
We are sick of it.
Poom, poom, poom, poom.

I've got something better.

<i>But it's so weird because we've
been preparing separately,</i>

23:13.807 --> 23:15.809
<i>and this will be
the first time we're all
on the stage together.</i>

23:15.842 --> 23:18.945
Let's hope it goes well.
You and Robin can carry it,
I'm sure.

25:20.900 --> 25:28.875
Robin, that was so good!

25:28.875 --> 25:35.048
Oh!

25:35.048 --> 25:37.751
I need to be able
to download that right now.

25:37.751 --> 25:40.820
Robin Thicke
and Banana Split!

25:40.820 --> 25:42.689
‐Wow!
‐ So amazing.

25:42.689 --> 25:44.591
Ken, talk to
Banana Split, please.

25:44.591 --> 25:49.829
First of all, another
pitch perfect performance
from Banana Split as usual.

25:49.863 --> 25:54.567
But I forget, after six
seasons of "The Masked Singer,"
we're all family.

25:54.567 --> 25:58.939
And this is just a reminder
every single day I go to work,

25:58.939 --> 26:01.641
we're in the presence
Totally.

26:01.641 --> 26:05.111
And he paid me to say that.
Okay, great.

26:05.111 --> 26:08.114
Tackling Stevie Wonder
and wrestling him to the ground

26:08.114 --> 26:10.717
and doing the splits on him?
Come on, people!

26:10.717 --> 26:13.653
So good. Brilliant job.
Thank you so much.

26:13.653 --> 26:14.854
We love it.

26:14.854 --> 26:16.957
Now, Robin,
I got a question for you.

26:16.957 --> 26:20.994
What do you learn by performing
with Banana Split?

26:20.994 --> 26:22.862
You know,
we've heard a lot of Broadway,

26:22.862 --> 26:25.498
we've heard a lot of classics,
and like Nicole said,

26:25.498 --> 26:29.336
to tackle Stevie Wonder
is to tackle the greatest
soul singer of all time.

26:29.369 --> 26:33.974
So I think that
it really showed that she has
unlimited range and colors.

26:33.974 --> 26:35.976
Even though
we're headed to finals,

26:35.976 --> 26:37.744
‐ I think there's
still more to see.
‐Absolutely.

26:37.744 --> 26:40.046
I want to know,
Robin, you're such a pro.

26:40.046 --> 26:41.114
But do you still get nervous
to perform?

26:41.114 --> 26:42.115
I did actually.
You know what?

26:42.115 --> 26:44.784
Here I am in front
of my friends of six seasons.

26:44.784 --> 26:46.386
‐ Aw.
‐You were a rock star.

26:46.386 --> 26:47.921
And I don't want to
be the reason they don't
make it to the finals,

26:47.921 --> 26:49.122
so I tried my best.

26:49.122 --> 26:50.857
Well,
you don't worry about that,

26:50.857 --> 26:52.058
because that
was an amazing job.

26:52.058 --> 26:55.962
All right, Banana Split,
head on backstage.

26:55.962 --> 26:59.099
Y'all keep it going for them.

26:59.099 --> 27:01.968
<i>Well, my heart is still beating
from that performance.</i>

27:01.968 --> 27:04.104
It was so fun to be
up there with Robin.

27:04.104 --> 27:06.773
But now we've gotta get
our sights set on the finale.

27:06.773 --> 27:08.975
Yeah, we hear Bull is,
like, a real showman.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.844
‐ Like, a real showman.
‐ But trust us.

27:10.844 --> 27:14.047
‐ No one puts on a show
like Banana...
‐ Split.

27:14.047 --> 27:16.082
<i>Coming up, Nicole's first ever</i>

27:16.082 --> 27:18.785
<i>performance on this stage
with Queen of Hearts.</i>

27:18.785 --> 27:22.822
That was a diva love session.
Yes, it was!

27:22.822 --> 27:25.792
<i>Then who will secure
their spot in the finale?</i>

27:25.792 --> 27:28.842
‐ The winner is...
-‐ Who is it?
- No way!

27:32.977 --> 27:34.512
Hey, it's your
old buddy Hilary.

27:34.512 --> 27:38.282
I'm just here to wish you
the best of luck
with all my heart.

27:38.282 --> 27:42.920
Go get them, Queen of Hearts.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.424
Welcome back
to "The Masked Singer"
Group B finals.

27:46.424 --> 27:52.030
Now it's Queen of Hearts' turn
to blaze the stage with Nicole.

27:52.030 --> 27:57.068
Watch this.

27:57.068 --> 28:00.505
<i>I'm so grateful that I said yes
to this experience,</i>

28:00.505 --> 28:03.541
and the fact that I said yes
might surprise some people.

28:03.541 --> 28:05.543
<i>Because I've been known
to turn down</i>

28:05.543 --> 28:09.113
<i>some really big opportunities
with big price tags,</i>

28:09.113 --> 28:12.483
but something about
"The Masked Singer" just
really made me want to do it.

28:12.483 --> 28:15.553
<i>Because I knew
I'd be excited to play</i>

28:15.553 --> 28:17.488
<i>and do things
I've never done before.</i>

28:17.488 --> 28:19.223
I mean, I even sang in French.

28:22.427 --> 28:24.962
That is, by far,

28:24.962 --> 28:27.065
one of the best
vocal performances

28:27.065 --> 28:28.232
‐ in six seasons.
‐Yes.

28:28.232 --> 28:30.968
<i>I don't like
to brag about myself,</i>

28:30.968 --> 28:33.271
<i>but I feel really good
about what I'm doing here,</i>

28:33.271 --> 28:37.141
and it just taught me
that I just got to keep pushing.

28:37.141 --> 28:42.580
<i>Only one performance stands
between me taking on the Bull
in the grand finale.</i>

28:42.580 --> 28:45.083
<i>And I'm nervous,</i>

28:45.083 --> 28:50.455
but at least I got Nicole
by my side. I am so excited.

28:50.455 --> 28:52.423
<i>Heart is all about
the emotions,</i>

28:52.423 --> 28:55.460
and every time she sings,
I'm just moved.

28:55.460 --> 28:58.129
<i>Although rehearsing without
being in the same room</i>

28:58.129 --> 29:02.266
has been the weirdest.
<i>I always like to be prepared,</i>

29:02.266 --> 29:04.402
so doing a duet
with someone I have not met

29:04.402 --> 29:06.170
<i>in front of millions of people?</i>

29:06.170 --> 29:09.107
<i>It's way out
of my comfort zone.</i>

29:09.107 --> 29:14.979
So I'm right where I wanna be.
Whoo! I'm so excited.

Yeah, this wasn't a performance.
This was a concert.

31:58.176 --> 32:01.979

32:01.979 --> 32:03.247

32:21.232 --> 32:23.201
Two queens! Two queens!

32:23.201 --> 32:28.172
Nicole, is there
anything that you learned
from this performance,

32:28.206 --> 32:31.509
whether it's about
who this could be or even
just as a performer?

32:31.509 --> 32:34.545
As a performer, I mean, God,
she's just born with it.

32:34.545 --> 32:37.548
She's a natural, and she's just
all heart and soul.

32:37.548 --> 32:39.550
And she's so generous
and so giving.

32:39.550 --> 32:41.319
I mean, it's just a blessing

32:41.319 --> 32:43.421
to have you on this show
this season.

32:43.421 --> 32:46.190
‐ That was diva love session.
‐ A diva love session!

32:46.190 --> 32:49.961
Yes, it was! Yes, it was.

32:49.961 --> 32:52.530
Can we just say how fine
Miss Cleopatra looks over there?

32:52.530 --> 32:53.998
‐That's what
I'm saying, like‐‐
‐ Yo.

32:53.998 --> 32:56.801
‐ The glow is real.
‐ I mean, Nick,

32:56.801 --> 32:59.170
you're not the only one
with capes, okay?

32:59.170 --> 33:00.505
‐Okay.
‐ Ha!

33:00.505 --> 33:02.073
Look, I mean,
I've been waiting

33:02.073 --> 33:05.143
six season to sing,
all right, people?

33:05.143 --> 33:07.078
And you killed it indeed.

33:07.078 --> 33:08.880
Incredible job
to the both of you.

33:08.880 --> 33:13.151
Now, Queen of Hearts,
you can head on backstage
to your throne.

33:13.151 --> 33:16.220
Keep it going
it going for her.

33:16.220 --> 33:19.490
Nicole, it was so good!
I love you guys.

33:19.490 --> 33:22.427
<i>I was excited to sing
with Nicole,</i>

33:22.427 --> 33:25.163
but never having met the person
you're singing with,

33:25.163 --> 33:26.764
it's definitely strange.

33:26.764 --> 33:29.524
But, hey, I had to see
and feel with my heart.

33:29.524 --> 33:31.055
<i>♪ Who is that?</i>

33:35.410 --> 33:40.057
Welcome back
to "The Masked Singer"
Group B finals.

33:40.057 --> 33:43.594
Before we go any further,
how about those duets?

33:43.594 --> 33:46.397
‐ Yes! That's great.
‐ Amazing!

33:46.397 --> 33:48.633
You guys killed it.

33:48.633 --> 33:51.969
I'm here with Banana Split
and Queen of Hearts

33:51.969 --> 33:55.640
in one of the most
competitive races we've had
in Masked Singer history.

33:55.640 --> 33:58.843
‐ Ever.
‐ It's time for the audience,

33:58.843 --> 34:01.879
panel, and super fans
across America

34:01.879 --> 34:04.315
to vote for their favorite
of the night.

34:07.718 --> 34:15.092
Come on!

34:15.092 --> 34:18.329
That's some season
six lights, guys.

34:18.329 --> 34:20.631
The loser will be
forced to unmask,

34:20.631 --> 34:21.599
and the winner will move on

34:21.599 --> 34:29.273
to face Bull in next week's
season finale. The votes are in.

34:29.273 --> 34:36.981
‐ Oh, man. My heart.
‐ The winner of Group B... Is...

34:36.981 --> 34:43.521
You guys are all amazing!

34:43.521 --> 34:44.589
Two of the best ever.

34:44.589 --> 34:49.093
Oh, man, this is too hard.
They're too different.

34:49.093 --> 34:55.633
Come on, Nick!
It's killing me! Queen of Hearts!

34:55.633 --> 34:59.670
Whoo! Wow!

34:59.670 --> 35:06.244
‐ Oh, this is so hard.
‐ Crazy. Congratulations.

35:06.244 --> 35:10.348
Queen, you are headed
to next week's finale.

35:10.348 --> 35:14.152
‐ How are you feeling?
‐ Whoo! Lord.

35:14.152 --> 35:18.489
I'm just shaking.
Thank you so much.

35:18.489 --> 35:21.492
I really,
really appreciate this.

35:21.492 --> 35:25.496
This is so fun!
I'm gonna come back.

35:25.496 --> 35:29.400
Now how do you feel
about taking on the Bull?

35:29.400 --> 35:31.969
Gosh, I guess we'll just
have to see when we get there.

35:31.969 --> 35:35.373
It's gonna be a tough match
for that Golden Mask trophy,

35:35.373 --> 35:37.675
but we believe she can
get to it and do it, right?

35:37.675 --> 35:40.211
Thank y'all.
Queen of Hearts!

35:40.211 --> 35:43.347
Now go ahead and head on
back to the lair

35:43.347 --> 35:46.617
and prepare
for next week's finale.

35:46.617 --> 35:51.122
Take care, queen!
Men in black, help her out.

35:51.122 --> 35:52.457
And while we're cheering,

35:52.457 --> 35:58.429
let's give it up
for Banana Split. Yes!

35:58.429 --> 36:01.632
‐ I don't like
seeing them go home.
‐ We love you.

36:01.632 --> 36:05.369
Hey, why don't you do a recount?
Let's rethink this, okay?

36:05.369 --> 36:09.240
So, so sorry to see you go.
Some of the best characters

36:09.240 --> 36:11.409
we've ever had
on this show, right?

36:11.409 --> 36:14.612
‐ Come on.
‐ And even though
we hate to see you go,

36:14.612 --> 36:17.515
we are so glad
we get to see who you are!

36:17.515 --> 36:19.517
But before we get to that,

36:19.517 --> 36:22.220
panel,
you know what time it is.

36:22.220 --> 36:23.354
Oh, man.

36:23.354 --> 36:26.257
Men in black, bring out
the first impression guesses.

36:26.257 --> 36:32.563
Uh‐oh.

36:32.563 --> 36:35.433
Oh, this‐‐
this is gonna be bad.

36:35.433 --> 36:40.104
All right,
let's start with Robin. Sure.

36:40.104 --> 36:41.906
Your first impression.

36:41.906 --> 36:47.245
"Jennifer Nettles
and that other guy."

36:47.245 --> 36:50.081
‐ Right.
‐ That was a Nicole guess.

36:50.081 --> 36:52.350
‐ I'm not sticking with the‐‐
‐I was about to say,

36:52.350 --> 36:54.252
going with "Jennifer Nettles
and the other guy?"

36:54.252 --> 36:56.220
No, although
I love the other guy.

36:56.220 --> 36:59.457
I'm gonna land on
where I've been recently

36:59.457 --> 37:01.092
which is Ryan Tedder,

37:01.092 --> 37:03.227
and one of his frequent
collaborators, Leona Lewis.

37:03.227 --> 37:05.496
‐Nice.
‐ Okay.

37:05.496 --> 37:06.597
‐ Great guess.
‐ All right.

37:06.597 --> 37:09.600
Ken, your
first impression guess,

37:09.600 --> 37:11.469
Katharine McPhee
and David Foster.

37:11.469 --> 37:16.274
‐Whoa.
‐ Are you sticking
with that guess?

37:16.274 --> 37:18.810
I'm sticking with it, Daddy.

37:18.810 --> 37:19.944
All right.

37:19.944 --> 37:22.213
Which takes us
to Jennifer McCarthy Wahlberg,

37:22.213 --> 37:23.948
‐ our clue expert.
‐ Okay!

37:23.948 --> 37:27.485
Your first impression guess
happens to be

37:27.485 --> 37:29.654
Katharine McPhee
and David Foster.

37:29.654 --> 37:31.222
‐There you go.
‐Okay.

37:31.222 --> 37:35.460
‐ Whoo.
‐ Are you sticking with that?

37:35.460 --> 37:37.528
Of course it's them.
They're amazing.

37:37.528 --> 37:42.366
Hands down, no doubt,
this is David and Kat.

37:42.366 --> 37:46.103
All right, Nicole
your first impression guess

37:46.103 --> 37:49.207
was David Foster
and Katharine McPhee.

37:49.207 --> 37:51.609
‐Oh.
‐ Are you sticking with it?

37:51.609 --> 37:55.480
I'm sticking with it.
The "garden" clue
confirmed it all.

37:55.480 --> 37:58.349
I really hope and pray
it's David and Kat.

37:58.349 --> 38:00.151
It would just be an honor.

38:00.151 --> 38:04.088
I mean,
that's some season six talent
right there, guys, okay?

38:04.088 --> 38:06.591
Indeed, indeed.

38:06.591 --> 38:09.160
Well, you made
your final guesses, panel.

38:09.160 --> 38:11.262
Let's see
if any of you are right.

38:11.262 --> 38:13.264
Yes! I wanna know

39:21.890 --> 39:24.359
We bow down.
We are not worthy.

39:24.359 --> 39:27.029
To have you guys on our stage
is an honor.

39:27.029 --> 39:30.065
What was it like
being Banana Split?

39:30.065 --> 39:32.935
You literally feel like you're
a part of some weird circus act.

39:32.935 --> 39:35.704
‐ Yeah.
‐ I don't have the pleasure
of knowing Ken,

39:35.704 --> 39:37.873
although I'm a huge fan.
But the other three I know,

39:37.873 --> 39:40.075
and so it was kind of thrilling
to try and fool them,

39:40.075 --> 39:41.810
but we didn't really fool them.

39:41.810 --> 39:43.812
Is that because
we're a duo or what?

39:43.812 --> 39:45.814
You guys guessed us
right away. What the heck?

39:45.814 --> 39:46.882
Well, Ken noticed
right off the bat

39:46.882 --> 39:50.052
that you were conducting
while you were playing piano.

39:50.052 --> 39:51.887
And you're known for that.
That's one of the‐‐

39:51.887 --> 39:54.022
Right, but I'm actually a really
conductor, so...

39:54.022 --> 39:57.059
‐ I really am.
‐ I'm such a fan.

39:57.059 --> 39:58.694
I was waiting for you to sing,

39:58.694 --> 40:00.696
because I know you put
records back in the day.

40:00.696 --> 40:01.997
That's what
I would've loved to see.

40:01.997 --> 40:03.899
You could've flipped it on us!

40:03.899 --> 40:06.335
No, there would be no reason
for me to sing

40:06.335 --> 40:08.537
with this incredible singer
on stage with me.

40:08.537 --> 40:10.839
None, none, zero.

40:10.839 --> 40:12.941
Did you guys ever bicker
like a normal couple?

40:12.941 --> 40:14.843
You know what?
No, we didn't.

40:14.843 --> 40:16.745
We just decided
to go into this,

40:16.745 --> 40:19.348
just try to be as silly
as we possibly could, right?

40:19.348 --> 40:21.617
‐ Yeah.
‐ We are not a conventional
relationship.

40:21.617 --> 40:25.754
There can be lots
of quick judgments
about me and him together.

40:25.754 --> 40:26.989
And we just thought,
wow, this is such

40:26.989 --> 40:30.125
a cool opportunity
to present ourselves.

40:30.125 --> 40:32.694
We just truly love each other,

40:32.694 --> 40:34.062
and it's best not
to judge people, right?

40:34.062 --> 40:36.098
‐ Yep, absolutely.
‐ Absolutely.

40:36.098 --> 40:39.468
‐ Aw, I love you, hon.
‐The real love.

40:39.468 --> 40:41.870
Look, can I just say
that all four of you
did an amazing job.

40:41.870 --> 40:44.640
And, Ken, you and I
will get to it before long.

40:44.640 --> 40:47.476
‐ I'm gonna be a pop star!
‐ Oh, my God!

40:47.476 --> 40:52.347
‐ He's gonna make me...
‐ You told Ken you could
turn him into a star.

40:52.347 --> 40:53.849
Yes! He can do anything!
He can make me a star!

40:53.849 --> 40:54.983
I've been to karaoke
with this man.

40:54.983 --> 40:57.319
You know,
I was just trying to win.

40:57.319 --> 40:59.755
Oh. Got it. Got it.

40:59.755 --> 41:02.958
Not the first time,
won't be the last.

41:02.958 --> 41:06.261
All right, well,
next week it's finally here,

41:06.261 --> 41:08.297
our big season finale...

41:08.297 --> 41:11.466
‐ Yeah!
‐ Yes, yes, yes!

...where Queen of Hearts
will face off with the Bull

41:13.936 --> 41:16.071
for the coveted
Golden Mask trophy.
