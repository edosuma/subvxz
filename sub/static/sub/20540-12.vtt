00:36.567 --> 00:39.600
[cheers and applause]

00:40.567 --> 00:43.867
- Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:43.867 --> 00:45.033
I'm John Oliver.

00:45.033 --> 00:46.867
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:46.867 --> 00:50.367
And let us begin with
the biggest story of the week,

00:50.367 --> 00:52.734
which once again concerns
President Trump,

00:52.734 --> 00:55.500
two words that continue
to sound revolting together

00:55.500 --> 01:00.266
like "viscous discharge"
or "moist stockings."

01:00.266 --> 01:01.967
The president made news
on Tuesday

01:01.967 --> 01:03.934
with a startling decision.

01:03.934 --> 01:08.233
- Breaking news:
President Trump has just fired

01:08.233 --> 01:10.967
the embattled FBI director
James Comey.

01:10.967 --> 01:13.367
- Surprise, everyone!

01:13.367 --> 01:16.433
Do you remember normal weeks?
'Cause I don't.

01:16.433 --> 01:19.767
I don't remember what
they felt like.

01:19.767 --> 01:22.133
Everything about
Comey's firing was unusual,

01:22.133 --> 01:24.834
from the fact that he himself
found out about it from TV

01:24.834 --> 01:28.166
to the termination letter,
which was genuinely weird,

01:28.166 --> 01:30.633
and not just because it featured
Trump's signature

01:30.633 --> 01:33.100
which looks like
a heart rate monitor

01:33.100 --> 01:34.700
of a hamster on meth.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.033
It really does.

01:36.033 --> 01:37.633
It looks more like that

01:37.633 --> 01:40.066
than it looks like his name.

01:40.066 --> 01:42.734
But--but it was weird
because of this.

01:42.734 --> 01:46.200
- Trump firing Comey
in a bizarre letter stating...

01:59.834 --> 02:02.734
- Okay, it is just
inherently suspicious

02:02.734 --> 02:04.333
to try and put words
in Comey's mouth

02:04.333 --> 02:05.867
as you kick him out the door.

02:05.867 --> 02:08.767
That--that is the equivalent
of a breakup text reading,

02:08.767 --> 02:11.166
"Which I greatly appreciate
you informing me

02:11.166 --> 02:12.500
"on three separate occasions

02:12.500 --> 02:14.767
"that I was the most
enthusiastic, dexterous,

02:14.767 --> 02:16.667
"and intuitive lover
you ever had,

02:16.667 --> 02:19.467
"I nevertheless must
terminate your position

02:19.467 --> 02:21.000
as my girlfriend."

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Eggplant emoji.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.133
And--and it kept going,

02:25.133 --> 02:27.000
because the White House
spent the week

02:27.000 --> 02:30.200
emitting a series of confusing
and contradictory explanations

02:30.200 --> 02:32.066
claiming that Trump was
following the recommendation

02:32.066 --> 02:34.867
of his Deputy Attorney General
Rod Rosenstein,

02:34.867 --> 02:37.300
who had barely been in office
two weeks,

02:37.300 --> 02:40.367
and that he was acting on behalf
of a demoralized FBI,

02:40.367 --> 02:42.600
neither of which seemed
entirely plausible.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.400
And Trump blew up
the whole narrative anyway

02:45.400 --> 02:47.400
on Thursday when he sat down
with Lester Holt

02:47.400 --> 02:49.633
and undid two days
of damage control

02:49.633 --> 02:51.133
in just a few sentences.

02:51.133 --> 02:53.400
- Monday you met with
the Deputy Attorney General,

02:53.400 --> 02:54.633
Rod Rosen--Rosenstein--

02:54.633 --> 02:55.734
- Right.

02:55.734 --> 02:57.133
- Did you ask for
a recommendation?

02:57.133 --> 03:01.133
- Uh, what I did is,
I was going to fire Comey.

03:01.133 --> 03:02.734
My decision.
It was not--

03:02.734 --> 03:04.233
- You had made the decision
before they came in the room?

03:04.233 --> 03:06.300
- I was going to fire Comey.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.467
- Now, think about what
just happened there.

03:08.467 --> 03:10.800
Trump is so desperate
to appear dominant,

03:10.800 --> 03:13.066
he will rush to take the credit
for anything,

03:13.066 --> 03:15.200
no matter how bad it is.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.533
If you wanted him to confess
to murder,

03:17.533 --> 03:19.533
all a lawyer would have to say
is, "Your Honor,

03:19.533 --> 03:21.834
"the killer could not possibly
have been Donald Trump.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.100
"It must have been someone
much stronger

03:24.100 --> 03:26.867
and smarter, with a much
hotter daughter."

03:26.867 --> 03:28.767
And before they finish
that sentence,

03:28.767 --> 03:31.166
Trump would be yelling,
"I did it, it was me!

03:31.166 --> 03:34.333
Lock me up! Lock me up!
Lock me up!"

03:34.333 --> 03:39.300
But--but Trump didn't just
clarify who advised him

03:39.300 --> 03:40.867
to fire Comey.

03:40.867 --> 03:43.033
And quick recap,
it was a mirror.

03:43.033 --> 03:47.233
He also--he also indicated
one reason why he did it.

03:47.233 --> 03:50.667
- And in fact, when I decided to
just do it, I said to myself--

03:50.667 --> 03:52.800
I said, "You know...

03:52.800 --> 03:55.333
"This Russia thing
with Trump and Russia

03:55.333 --> 03:56.767
"is a made-up story.

03:56.767 --> 03:58.567
"It's an excuse by the Democrats

03:58.567 --> 04:00.033
"for having lost an election

04:00.033 --> 04:01.834
that they should have won."

04:01.834 --> 04:04.266
- What are you doing?

04:04.266 --> 04:06.200
"I was thinking
of the Russia investigation

04:06.200 --> 04:08.467
when I fired Comey"
is the one thing

04:08.467 --> 04:10.834
that you are not supposed
to say out loud.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.967
It's the kind of response that
makes you ask three questions:

04:13.967 --> 04:16.467
one, can he really
be this stupid?

04:16.467 --> 04:20.000
Two, does he really think we
as a country are this stupid?

04:20.000 --> 04:23.700
And three, are we as a country
this stupid?

04:23.700 --> 04:27.233
And it's entirely possible the
answer to all three questions

04:27.233 --> 04:29.133
are "yes."

04:29.133 --> 04:30.467
And it got even worse

04:30.467 --> 04:32.400
as Lester Holt asked Trump
about his claim

04:32.400 --> 04:35.166
that Comey had exonerated him
three times.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.000
- He said it once at dinner,

04:37.000 --> 04:38.967
and then he said it twice
during phone calls.

04:38.967 --> 04:40.500
- Did you call him?

04:40.500 --> 04:43.266
- Uh, in one case I called him;
in one case he called me.

04:43.266 --> 04:44.967
- And did you ask,
"Am I under investigation?"

04:44.967 --> 04:46.066
- I actually asked him, yes.

04:46.066 --> 04:47.367
I said...

04:47.367 --> 04:50.033
"If it's possible,
would you let me know,

04:50.033 --> 04:51.867
am I under investigation?"

04:51.867 --> 04:54.433
He said, "You are not
under investigation."

04:54.433 --> 04:56.567
- I call bullshit.

04:56.567 --> 04:59.467
I call turbo bullshit on that.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.400
There is no way
those conversations

05:01.400 --> 05:02.767
went down in that manner.

05:02.767 --> 05:05.233
Trump has somehow managed
to be both a terrible

05:05.233 --> 05:06.967
and an amazing liar,

05:06.967 --> 05:09.400
and I don't know how that's
physically possible.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.967
And sure enough, Comey's
far more plausible version

05:11.967 --> 05:14.700
of the dinner Trump mentioned
soon made its way to the press.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.834
- Comey told associates
that at dinner,

05:16.834 --> 05:19.767
the president asked if
he would pledge his loyalty.

05:19.767 --> 05:21.500
Comey declined,

05:21.500 --> 05:24.633
instead telling the president
he would always be honest.

05:24.633 --> 05:27.100
The president asked
two more times,

05:27.100 --> 05:28.767
and Comey refused again.

05:28.767 --> 05:32.567
The third time, Mr. Trump
asked for "honest loyalty."

05:32.567 --> 05:34.266
To that, Comey responded...

05:36.600 --> 05:39.667
- To which Mr. Trump said,
"How about loyal honesty?"

05:39.667 --> 05:41.400
And then Mr. Comey said,

05:41.400 --> 05:43.467
"Well, how's that different
from honesty loyalty?"

05:43.467 --> 05:44.834
And then Mr. Trump said,

05:44.834 --> 05:46.367
"If you don't see what
difference it makes,

05:46.367 --> 05:47.834
just agree to it."

05:47.834 --> 05:49.900
And then Mr. Comey said,
"No way,"

05:49.900 --> 05:51.367
to which Mr. Trump replied,

05:51.367 --> 05:53.000
"Why not? Scared?",

05:53.000 --> 05:54.934
prompting Mr. Comey to respond,

05:54.934 --> 05:56.233
"Idiot says what?",

05:56.233 --> 05:57.834
to which Mr. Trump replied,

05:57.834 --> 05:59.800
"What?"

05:59.800 --> 06:02.967
And then Comey's soul
left his body,

06:02.967 --> 06:04.333
walked out of the room,

06:04.333 --> 06:05.867
turning back to him
and saying,

06:05.867 --> 06:07.066
"Are you coming?

06:07.066 --> 06:09.533
Because frankly,
I'm done with this shit."

06:09.533 --> 06:12.467
Now, Trump unsurprisingly
denied Comey's account.

06:12.467 --> 06:13.934
And then on Friday morning,

06:13.934 --> 06:16.867
he tweeted something ominous
even by his standards.

06:16.867 --> 06:18.467
- The breaking news
this morning:

06:18.467 --> 06:21.033
the President of the United
States just threatened the man

06:21.033 --> 06:23.200
he fired as FBI director.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.567
- In an extraordinary
tweet today, Trump warned...

06:31.934 --> 06:35.033
- Tweets like that are actually
really difficult to parse,

06:35.033 --> 06:36.266
because they are somehow both

06:36.266 --> 06:38.200
a borderline obstruction
of justice

06:38.200 --> 06:41.467
and the meaningless rantings
of a confused old idiot.

06:41.467 --> 06:44.967
They exist in two opposite
states simultaneously.

06:44.967 --> 06:47.967
Trump is truly
a Schrodinger's Asshole.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.900
And--and I will say this.

06:49.900 --> 06:53.734
If he  is
recording everything
that happens in the Oval Office,

06:53.734 --> 06:56.033
I actually don't want
to hear those tapes,

06:56.033 --> 06:57.667
'cause I'm assuming
it's just his voice

06:57.667 --> 06:59.100
muttering the sentence,

06:59.100 --> 07:02.066
"I never wanted any of this"
over and over again,

07:02.066 --> 07:05.000
occasionally interrupted by
mattress commercial jingles

07:05.000 --> 07:06.767
and string cheese farts.

07:06.767 --> 07:08.800
So--so at this point,

07:08.800 --> 07:10.633
President Trump has
made it very clear,

07:10.633 --> 07:12.834
he fired the director
of the FBI

07:12.834 --> 07:14.900
at least partially due
to unhappiness

07:14.900 --> 07:16.567
with the Bureau's investigation

07:16.567 --> 07:19.033
into his campaign's possible
collusion with Russia,

07:19.033 --> 07:22.367
which is both shocking and yet
completely unsurprising.

07:22.367 --> 07:24.433
There is really nothing
Trump could do

07:24.433 --> 07:26.367
to genuinely shock me right now.

07:26.367 --> 07:28.100
If--if you said he fired Comey

07:28.100 --> 07:30.433
because he's investigating
Russia, I'd believe you.

07:30.433 --> 07:33.033
If you said he did it
because Comey is 6'8"

07:33.033 --> 07:35.700
and Trump feels like a tiny
little man standing next to him,

07:35.700 --> 07:37.033
I would believe you.

07:37.033 --> 07:38.400
If you said he fired Comey,

07:38.400 --> 07:39.900
walked into the Oval Office,

07:39.900 --> 07:41.266
spread peanut butter
on his genitals,

07:41.266 --> 07:43.200
brought in 35 squirrels
and yelled,

07:43.200 --> 07:45.133
"Buckle up,
Daddy's brought dinner,"

07:45.133 --> 07:47.600
I'd say "Sure, yeah.
Sure, why not?"

07:47.600 --> 07:49.166
That sounds like something

07:49.166 --> 07:51.266
the President of
the United States would do.

07:51.266 --> 07:53.533
That's the world we live in now.

07:53.533 --> 07:55.000
You know what?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.333
It--it is too easy

07:56.333 --> 07:58.033
to point at Trump being crazy.

07:58.033 --> 08:00.533
That's what he does,
that is not going to stop,

08:00.533 --> 08:02.734
and it's going to be
exhausting for everyone.

08:02.734 --> 08:06.066
The important question is,
what do the rest of us do?

08:06.066 --> 08:08.233
And that brings us to Congress:

08:08.233 --> 08:11.300
534 people less annoying
than Ted Cruz

08:11.300 --> 08:14.133
and also Ted Cruz.

08:14.133 --> 08:18.166
Because it is time for each
and every one of them

08:18.166 --> 08:19.333
to pick a lane here.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.700
They do have options.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.233
Obviously, there are
the investigations that

08:22.233 --> 08:23.233
are currently ongoing.

08:23.233 --> 08:24.533
Uh, but they could also, uh,

08:24.533 --> 08:26.200
press Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein

08:26.200 --> 08:28.834
to appoint a special counsel
within the Justice Department.

08:28.834 --> 08:31.200
But at the very,
very least here,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.233
they need to acknowledge
that what has happened

08:33.233 --> 08:34.633
is fucked up

08:34.633 --> 08:37.066
and not continue to give
non-answers

08:37.066 --> 08:38.400
like the one Paul Ryan did

08:38.400 --> 08:40.867
when asked about Trump's
tape-recording threat.

08:40.867 --> 08:42.400
- I've decided
I'm not gonna comment

08:42.400 --> 08:44.000
on the tweets of the day
or the hour.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.834
Uh, I haven't seen them all,
to be candid with you.

08:45.834 --> 08:48.333
Uh, look, the comment, I'm--
I'm sure some of you

08:48.333 --> 08:49.867
probably want to ask
this question as well,

08:49.867 --> 08:52.266
um, no one's disputing
the fact that the president

08:52.266 --> 08:55.533
has the right to hire or fire
an FBI director.

08:55.533 --> 08:57.700
He made that decision;
it's been made.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.433
- Yeah, but that's not
answering the question, is it?

09:00.433 --> 09:02.467
That's just regurgitating
what happened.

09:02.467 --> 09:04.500
It's honestly incredible
to watch a man

09:04.500 --> 09:07.300
who spends 90 minutes
every morning working out

09:07.300 --> 09:10.200
refuse to show
any strength whatsoever.

09:10.200 --> 09:14.667
Apparently, no part of P90X
targets the backbone.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.834
And--and at town halls
this week,

09:16.834 --> 09:19.133
some members of Congress
like Rod Blum from Iowa

09:19.133 --> 09:20.734
have been in such deep denial,

09:20.734 --> 09:22.533
they don't seem aware of how bad

09:22.533 --> 09:24.133
what they're saying sounds.

09:24.133 --> 09:27.567
- Will you support
an independent investigation

09:27.567 --> 09:32.467
into Trump and his campaign's
purported ties to Russia?

09:32.467 --> 09:33.867
- Not at the current time.

09:33.867 --> 09:35.233
If Trump was guilty
of something,

09:35.233 --> 09:36.834
would he fire
the FBI director?

09:36.834 --> 09:39.033
'Cause that's a pretty--
that'd be a pretty dumb move.

09:39.033 --> 09:40.467
- Yeah.

09:40.467 --> 09:41.800
Yes, it would, Rod.

09:41.800 --> 09:42.800
Yes.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.266
And unless Plum has a disease

09:44.266 --> 09:47.200
where he says genuine things
in a sarcastic voice,

09:47.200 --> 09:49.600
that was also
a very stupid thing to say.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.467
"Oh, yeah, right,
unicorns are imaginary.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.767
"And penises are where
the pee comes from.

09:54.767 --> 09:57.934
Whatever, idiot.
Leave me alone."

09:57.934 --> 10:00.667
The point is, the founding
fathers created a system

10:00.667 --> 10:03.300
of checks and balances to limit
the power of the president,

10:03.300 --> 10:07.133
but it only works if someone
fucking checks or balances.

10:07.133 --> 10:08.300
And if you don't,

10:08.300 --> 10:10.000
it's no longer on Trump.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.500
It's on you.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.667
Because when you've got
the presidential equivalent

10:13.667 --> 10:15.934
of a five-year-old shitting
on the salad bar

10:15.934 --> 10:18.867
of a Ruby Tuesday's,
at some point

10:18.867 --> 10:20.633
you stop blaming
the five-year-old,

10:20.633 --> 10:23.500
and you start blaming the people
who are not stopping him.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.667
Stop that boy.
That's what I'm saying.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.467
Stop that boy now.

10:28.467 --> 10:29.467
[cheers and applause]

10:29.467 --> 10:32.133
Now, for now--move--moving on

10:32.133 --> 10:35.000
to a quick update regarding
New Zealand,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.500
Wallaby Fuck Island.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.967
Now, you may remember last week,

10:38.967 --> 10:41.266
we talked about the historically
stupid legal battle

10:41.266 --> 10:43.300
involving that country's
ruling National Party

10:43.300 --> 10:45.433
being accused of ripping off
the "8 Mile" song

10:45.433 --> 10:47.533
"Lose Yourself" by Eminem,

10:47.533 --> 10:50.400
or as they call him
in New Zealand, Eemineem.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.033
Our piece was actually brought
to the attention

10:53.033 --> 10:55.100
of New Zealand's prime minister
Bill English,

10:55.100 --> 10:58.367
uh, the very poorest man's
Daniel Craig.

10:58.367 --> 11:02.333
And it turns out
he is not a fan.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.066
- Have you seen
the John Oliver piece

11:04.066 --> 11:06.166
where he mocks, uh,
the National Party

11:06.166 --> 11:09.100
for allegedly
ripping off Eminem?

11:09.100 --> 11:10.333
- No, I haven't.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.467
- Do you intend to watch--
watch it?

11:11.467 --> 11:12.934
- Nah, no.

11:12.934 --> 11:14.900
Yeah, for the sake of his
audience, I hope it's funny.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.900
Some of the stuff I've seen
he does isn't very funny.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.934
[audience oohs]

11:21.433 --> 11:23.600
- You really want
to do this, Bill?

11:23.600 --> 11:25.133
[laughter and applause]

11:25.133 --> 11:27.600
Is this really what you want?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.834
Because need I remind you

11:29.834 --> 11:31.767
that when your fellow
party member

11:31.767 --> 11:33.734
Steven Joyce got dick-smacked
in the mouth

11:33.734 --> 11:35.433
by a rubber floppy cock

11:35.433 --> 11:38.233
and then suggested "someone send
the gift over to John Oliver

11:38.233 --> 11:39.834
so we can get it over with,"

11:39.834 --> 11:43.433
we ended that show with
a flying dildopalooza.

11:43.433 --> 11:46.266
So careful, Bill, 'cause
when it comes to Kiwis,

11:46.266 --> 11:48.500
Johnny don't play.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.400
And Bill English must know

11:50.400 --> 11:52.033
that the moment
he mentioned my name,

11:52.033 --> 11:54.433
I was going to immediately
find the stupidest,

11:54.433 --> 11:56.834
most humiliating things
about him that I could,

11:56.834 --> 11:59.166
like this actual photo
of Bill English

11:59.166 --> 12:01.333
in a virtual reality headset,

12:01.333 --> 12:04.900
which makes him look like
a masturbating cyborg.

12:04.900 --> 12:09.767
Or this indescribably lame video
he made of his exercise routine.

12:32.767 --> 12:34.100
- What?

12:34.100 --> 12:36.133
You know, after seeing that,

12:36.133 --> 12:38.133
I would give anything
for Bill English

12:38.133 --> 12:39.767
to make a sex tape.

12:39.767 --> 12:43.233
"Well, I'm about to head in
for what I call a penis-vagina,

12:43.233 --> 12:45.400
"uh, where I penis
the vagina bits

12:45.400 --> 12:47.667
"and, uh, she vaginas
the penis bits.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.967
"Uh, this is the bit
where I penis fast.

12:49.967 --> 12:52.667
"And this is the bit
where I penis slow.

12:52.667 --> 12:56.033
Uh, stick around,
this is gonna take a while."

12:56.033 --> 12:58.300
But perhaps the worst thing
Bill English

12:58.300 --> 12:59.767
has ever been responsible for

12:59.767 --> 13:01.900
is this recent Facebook post
where he writes,

13:01.900 --> 13:03.900
"Cooked dinner for
the family last night.

13:03.900 --> 13:07.200
Like if you agree with
tinned spaghetti on pizza,"

13:07.200 --> 13:09.834
with photos of fucking
canned spaghetti

13:09.834 --> 13:12.700
poured all over
a revolting pizza he made.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.033
And I think I speak on behalf
of all humanity

13:15.033 --> 13:16.734
when I say, no.

13:16.734 --> 13:18.767
Hard no there, Bill.

13:18.767 --> 13:22.000
I do not agree with
canned spaghetti on a pizza,

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
because that is not a thing
anybody should be doing.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.300
A divorced dad cooking
for his kids on the weekend

13:28.300 --> 13:30.500
would not put canned spaghetti
on a pizza.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.433
The caterer for
Chef Boyardee's funeral

13:33.433 --> 13:35.900
would not put canned spaghetti
on a pizza.

13:35.900 --> 13:37.567
And let's not forget, Bill,

13:37.567 --> 13:40.700
you also added pineapple
to that abomination.

13:40.700 --> 13:41.934
And that's not dinner.

13:41.934 --> 13:43.300
That is--and this is true--

13:43.300 --> 13:45.433
an actual hate crime.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.333
What the fuck is
your problem, Bill?

13:47.333 --> 13:49.333
You made that to feed
to your family?

13:49.333 --> 13:50.800
To your children, Bill?

13:50.800 --> 13:53.767
How are you not in prison
right now?

13:53.767 --> 13:55.800
The point is...

13:55.800 --> 13:57.500
I'm sorry, the point is,

13:57.500 --> 13:59.934
I am sorry if our show

13:59.934 --> 14:01.834
is not to your liking,
Bill English,

14:01.834 --> 14:04.433
Prime Minister of New Zealand.

14:04.433 --> 14:06.934
Although to be honest, judging
from your pizza choices,

14:06.934 --> 14:09.100
if I appeal to someone with
your level of taste,

14:09.100 --> 14:12.066
I'd be absolutely mortified.

14:12.066 --> 14:13.500
And you know,
it's times like these

14:13.500 --> 14:16.166
that a lyric from the song
"Lose Yourself"

14:16.166 --> 14:17.533
comes to mind:

14:17.533 --> 14:20.500
"Yo, his palms are sweaty,
knees weak,

14:20.500 --> 14:21.767
"arms are heavy.

14:21.767 --> 14:23.900
"There's vomit on his
sweater already.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.600
Mom's spaghetti."

14:25.600 --> 14:29.033
And the reason
those lyrics come to mind is,

14:29.033 --> 14:30.934
though I would honestly
rather eat

14:30.934 --> 14:34.000
Eminem's vomit spaghetti
off his sweater

14:34.000 --> 14:35.767
than canned spaghetti
and pineapple

14:35.767 --> 14:38.500
off one of your
garbage pizzas, Bill.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.100
[cheers and applause]

14:40.100 --> 14:42.300
And now, this.

14:50.066 --> 14:52.767
A pizza topped with Skittles,
baking soda,

14:52.767 --> 14:54.333
and condoms.

14:54.333 --> 14:57.300
A pizza topped with Altoids
and horse laxatives.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.967
And you don't know
which is which.

14:58.967 --> 15:00.900
So good luck with that.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.500
A pizza made by a purebred
Golden Retriever.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.500
Good boy.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.667
A pizza topped with blueberries,

15:08.667 --> 15:10.600
onions, and a printed-out copy

15:10.600 --> 15:13.467
of the Wikipedia entry
for "pizza."

15:13.467 --> 15:17.200
And finally, a pizza topped
with 25 Blu-Rays

15:17.200 --> 15:20.233
of "8 Mile,"
because fuck you.

15:22.233 --> 15:24.900
You filthy animal.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.500
[playful music]

15:27.500 --> 15:29.767
[cheers and applause]

15:29.767 --> 15:33.066
- Moving on.
Our main story tonight

15:33.066 --> 15:34.867
is something that you're
probably not expecting,

15:34.867 --> 15:37.700
because we're going to talk
about kidney dialysis.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.567
And I know that right now
you're probably getting ready

15:39.567 --> 15:41.567
to push the button
on your TV remote marked

15:41.567 --> 15:43.967
"Dear God,
Literally Anything Else."

15:43.967 --> 15:47.066
But I promise you
this is worth listening to,

15:47.066 --> 15:48.500
because dialysis
is not something

15:48.500 --> 15:50.066
that everybody understands.

15:50.066 --> 15:52.400
Just listen to one patient
describe a conversation

15:52.400 --> 15:54.133
that she had with her neighbor.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.900
- I have a--the lady
next door to me now,

15:55.900 --> 15:57.400
she said to me,
"Where do you go

15:57.400 --> 15:58.467
three days a week?"

15:58.467 --> 16:00.066
She knew
the three days a week.

16:00.066 --> 16:02.700
I said, "Why, are you
writing a book, a mystery?"

16:02.700 --> 16:04.100
I said, "I go to dialysis."

16:04.100 --> 16:05.800
She said, "Oh, you're a drunk.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.300
I thought you said
you didn't drink."

16:07.300 --> 16:09.433
I said, "If you don't
get out of my face,

16:09.433 --> 16:11.400
you will need a doctor."

16:11.400 --> 16:12.667
- Wow.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.500
If--if I was her neighbor,

16:14.500 --> 16:16.767
I would not fuck with that lady.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.934
What I would do is
get out of her face,

16:18.934 --> 16:21.266
go home,
Google what dialysis is,

16:21.266 --> 16:22.967
just to cool down
the temperature

16:22.967 --> 16:24.133
in that relationship.

16:24.133 --> 16:25.800
And--and here is the answer
to that.

16:25.800 --> 16:29.667
Dialysis is basically where
a machine acts as your kidneys

16:29.667 --> 16:32.433
by taking blood out
of your body, cleaning it,

16:32.433 --> 16:33.934
and then returning it to you.

16:33.934 --> 16:36.600
Think of it as a Brita pitcher
for your blood,

16:36.600 --> 16:40.300
which yes, is more disgusting
than I needed to make it sound.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.133
Dialysis can be a truly
exhausting process.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.900
Uh, you're typically
sitting in a chair,

16:44.900 --> 16:46.533
physically attached
to a machine

16:46.533 --> 16:48.700
for three four-hour sessions
a week.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.834
And Americans have been at
increasing risk of needing it,

16:51.834 --> 16:53.200
because chronic kidney disease

16:53.200 --> 16:55.166
is the ninth leading
cause of death

16:55.166 --> 16:56.934
in the United States.

16:56.934 --> 16:58.667
And while a lucky few
manage to get transplants,

16:58.667 --> 17:01.867
for many, dialysis is their
only option to stay alive.

17:01.867 --> 17:03.300
But interestingly here,

17:03.300 --> 17:05.667
while America spends more,
by some accounts,

17:05.667 --> 17:07.934
than any other nation
on dialysis care,

17:07.934 --> 17:10.433
we have one of
the industrialized world's

17:10.433 --> 17:11.900
highest mortality rates.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.166
So we're spending the most

17:13.166 --> 17:15.300
to essentially get the least.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.867
We're basically paying for
a fully-loaded Lamborghini

17:17.867 --> 17:21.300
and receiving a drunk donkey
on roller skates.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.834
This--this story,
the story of dialysis,

17:23.834 --> 17:26.200
is an amazing case study
of good intentions

17:26.200 --> 17:28.200
being thwarted by
bad incentives,

17:28.200 --> 17:30.266
poor oversight,
and profiteering.

17:30.266 --> 17:31.967
And one of the key characters
in this story

17:31.967 --> 17:34.200
is, incredibly, this guy.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.934
- â™ª Just take those old
records off the shelf â™ª

17:37.934 --> 17:41.800
â™ª I sit and listen to 'em
by myself â™ª

17:41.800 --> 17:45.567
â™ª Today's music ain't
got the same soul â™ª

17:45.567 --> 17:49.166
â™ª I like that old time
rock and roll â™ª

17:49.166 --> 17:52.300
- Now, if you are
understandably thinking,

17:52.300 --> 17:55.300
"Who is that man doing barefoot
gymnastics to Bob Seger

17:55.300 --> 17:57.400
"while dressed like
the third saddest waiter

17:57.400 --> 17:58.867
at a Medieval Times?"

17:58.867 --> 18:02.500
Well, that is the CEO
of DaVita Incorporated,

18:02.500 --> 18:04.533
a for-profit kidney
dialysis company,

18:04.533 --> 18:07.433
and I promise we will get
to that man in a moment.

18:07.433 --> 18:09.500
But first, let me give you
a sense of the history

18:09.500 --> 18:11.266
of dialysis in this country,

18:11.266 --> 18:13.467
'cause in the early years
of, uh, the machines,

18:13.467 --> 18:15.600
access to them was so limited,

18:15.600 --> 18:18.233
one hospital had
an actual death panel

18:18.233 --> 18:20.467
to decide who would
get to use them.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.166
- Somebody has got to decide

18:22.166 --> 18:24.533
who shall live
and who shall die.

18:24.533 --> 18:26.166
- Two or three were rejected,
I think.

18:26.166 --> 18:27.166
I don't know why.

18:27.166 --> 18:28.433
Either for medical reasons

18:28.433 --> 18:30.233
or psychological reasons

18:30.233 --> 18:33.266
or just didn't have
the $30,000.

18:42.467 --> 18:46.100
- Mr. Duff, what happened
to those who were turned down?

18:46.100 --> 18:47.433
- They're dead.

18:47.433 --> 18:50.033
- Oh, my God!

18:50.033 --> 18:52.200
That man does not
sugarcoat things.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.700
"They're dead.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.000
"Also, your pet only loves you
'cause you feed it,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
"the tooth fairy
is your father,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.500
"and 30% of babies grow up
to be assholes.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.767
Good day to you, sir."

19:02.767 --> 19:04.834
Now, in 1972, though,

19:04.834 --> 19:06.633
something amazing happened.

19:06.633 --> 19:08.900
Richard Nixon--
yes, Richard Nixon--

19:08.900 --> 19:11.867
signed a bill into law which
said that the government

19:11.867 --> 19:14.100
would pay for dialysis for
anyone who needed it,

19:14.100 --> 19:15.667
which is really incredible.

19:15.667 --> 19:18.033
Essentially, we have
universal health care

19:18.033 --> 19:21.066
in this country
for one organ in the body.

19:21.066 --> 19:23.800
It's--it's like your kidneys,
and only your kidneys,

19:23.800 --> 19:24.967
are Canadian.

19:24.967 --> 19:28.033
"Oh, sorry there's
two of us, eh.

19:28.033 --> 19:32.233
Don't mean to take too much
space up down here, eh."

19:32.233 --> 19:35.367
That's a good accent, and
I do not apologize for it.

19:35.367 --> 19:38.600
Now--now, at the time--
that's a great accent.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.667
Now, at--at the time
that bill was passed,

19:41.667 --> 19:43.700
it only covered around
10,000 patients.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.467
But four decades later,
thanks in part

19:45.467 --> 19:47.800
to the rise of diabetes
and high blood pressure,

19:47.800 --> 19:51.200
nearly half a million people
are undergoing dialysis.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.500
That's a 46-fold rise.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.100
46 folds!

19:55.100 --> 19:58.433
Technically speaking, that is
a pug's face worth of folds.

19:58.433 --> 20:00.467
And--and as a result,

20:00.467 --> 20:02.934
and this is true, treating
end-stage kidney disease,

20:02.934 --> 20:07.133
uh, takes up nearly 1%
of the entire federal budget.

20:07.133 --> 20:08.734
Just think about that
for a second.

20:08.734 --> 20:11.266
We devote 2%
of the federal budget

20:11.266 --> 20:13.266
to the Department of Education.

20:13.266 --> 20:15.000
And that's the thing
that helps you know

20:15.000 --> 20:17.533
what a percent is.

20:17.533 --> 20:20.500
And--and a vast industry
has emerged to accommodate

20:20.500 --> 20:22.033
all these patients.

20:22.033 --> 20:24.900
There are around 7,000
outpatient dialysis clinics

20:24.900 --> 20:25.900
in the country today.

20:25.900 --> 20:27.266
And around 70%

20:27.266 --> 20:30.500
are owned by just two
big for-profit companies:

20:30.500 --> 20:32.433
Fresenius and DaVita.

20:32.433 --> 20:34.900
And let me be clear,
there are significant issues

20:34.900 --> 20:37.133
with both of them,
but to understand this system,

20:37.133 --> 20:39.600
tonight we're going
to focus on DaVita.

20:39.600 --> 20:43.000
Their CEO, Kent Thiry,
is the showboating musketeer

20:43.000 --> 20:44.467
that you saw earlier.

20:44.467 --> 20:46.834
And he loves to inspire
his employees at meetings.

20:46.834 --> 20:50.600
He--he's also made grand
entrances, uh, on a bicycle.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.100
He's even ridden in on a horse.

20:53.100 --> 20:56.100
And spare a thought
for that horse there.

20:56.100 --> 21:00.133
That--that is by far the most
humiliating credit on its resume

21:00.133 --> 21:01.867
and it did use to do porn,

21:01.867 --> 21:05.033
so you have to
bear that in mind.

21:05.033 --> 21:08.567
Thiry is a former
Bain & Company consultant

21:08.567 --> 21:10.467
who managed to take DaVita
from near-bankruptcy

21:10.467 --> 21:13.333
to being valued today
at $13 billion.

21:13.333 --> 21:16.367
He's even been the subject
of an admiring case study

21:16.367 --> 21:17.900
taught at
Harvard Business School,

21:17.900 --> 21:19.367
which called
his management style

21:19.367 --> 21:20.934
"arguably eccentric,"

21:20.934 --> 21:22.266
and you can see why.

21:22.266 --> 21:24.066
He calls his company
a "village,"

21:24.066 --> 21:26.934
uh, his employees "teammates"
or "citizens,"

21:26.934 --> 21:30.367
and as for himself, well,
he's got his own special title.

21:30.367 --> 21:32.500
- This is K.T. here, your mayor

21:32.500 --> 21:35.900
from the Casa Nueva
in Colorado.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.633
- Yes, you heard right.

21:37.633 --> 21:39.467
He calls himself "the mayor,"

21:39.467 --> 21:40.967
a title so ridiculous,

21:40.967 --> 21:42.300
you may not have noticed

21:42.300 --> 21:43.967
he's standing next
to a fucking falcon.

21:43.967 --> 21:45.133
[laughter]

21:45.133 --> 21:46.900
That is the most
humiliating thing

21:46.900 --> 21:48.367
on that bird's resume,

21:48.367 --> 21:49.767
and it used to do porn.

21:49.767 --> 21:53.433
So, at this--at this point,

21:53.433 --> 21:55.967
at this point,
we should probably address

21:55.967 --> 21:57.600
the whole weird musketeer thing.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.266
It's an obsession
that apparently stems

21:59.266 --> 22:01.233
from the Leonardo DiCaprio movie

22:01.233 --> 22:02.967
"The Man in the Iron Mask,"

22:02.967 --> 22:05.667
which, yeah--which Thiry says
inspired him to make

22:05.667 --> 22:07.367
a "transformative life decision"

22:07.367 --> 22:10.066
to take the DaVita job,
which is already insane,

22:10.066 --> 22:13.100
because this is
a ridiculous movie to choose

22:13.100 --> 22:14.567
as the basis for anything.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.433
Let me give you
just a small taste.

22:17.433 --> 22:19.834
- If we must die...

22:19.834 --> 22:21.567
let it be like this.

22:21.567 --> 22:23.100
- One for all.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.133
All for one.

22:24.133 --> 22:27.133
[rousing music]

22:27.133 --> 22:34.166
â™ª â™ª

22:36.467 --> 22:38.734
- That--that remains

22:38.734 --> 22:41.834
one of the weirdest decisions
in moviemaking history.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.834
"Hey, the world's
biggest heartthrob

22:43.834 --> 22:45.433
"at the peak of his popularity

22:45.433 --> 22:46.967
"agreed to be in our movie.

22:46.967 --> 22:48.300
"What should we do with him?

22:48.300 --> 22:50.633
"Oh, I know, let's put him
in a weird mask

22:50.633 --> 22:52.066
"that covers his whole face

22:52.066 --> 22:53.734
"and just have him stand there.

22:53.734 --> 22:57.033
"I guarantee that teenage girls
all across America

22:57.033 --> 22:59.600
"are going to have that image
on their bedroom walls.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.433
He looks even hotter now."

23:02.433 --> 23:04.834
Thiry even closes
company meetings

23:04.834 --> 23:06.500
quoting that movie.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.367
- If we must dialyze,
let it be like this.

23:08.367 --> 23:09.467
One for all!

23:09.467 --> 23:10.667
crowd: All for one!

23:10.667 --> 23:11.734
- One for all!

23:11.734 --> 23:13.000
crowd: All for one!

23:13.000 --> 23:14.166
- One for  all!

23:14.166 --> 23:15.500
crowd: All for one!

23:15.500 --> 23:17.300
- Damn straight.
Have fun, good night.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.900
[cheers and applause]

23:18.900 --> 23:21.900
- â™ª Celebrate good times â™ª

23:21.900 --> 23:23.934
â™ª Come on â™ª

23:23.934 --> 23:25.934
- Cool.

23:25.934 --> 23:27.667
And--and look, here's the thing.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.200
For shareholders,
Thiry's techniques have worked.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.867
DaVita posted nearly
$800 million

23:32.867 --> 23:34.266
in profit last year.

23:34.266 --> 23:37.100
But the experience for patients
can be different.

23:37.100 --> 23:39.734
DaVita runs a pretty
lean operation,

23:39.734 --> 23:41.100
which the government allows.

23:41.100 --> 23:43.300
The federal guidelines
don't require clinics

23:43.300 --> 23:44.834
to have a doctor onsite

23:44.834 --> 23:46.200
at any given time,

23:46.200 --> 23:47.633
which seems a little odd.

23:47.633 --> 23:50.300
Uh, they also require that
only one nurse be present

23:50.300 --> 23:51.734
in the facility.

23:51.734 --> 23:54.033
And a study has found
that for-profit clinics

23:54.033 --> 23:56.100
have about as third fewer nurses

23:56.100 --> 23:57.867
than their non-profit
competitors,

23:57.867 --> 23:59.834
and that might explain
why some DaVita patients

23:59.834 --> 24:03.900
say they can feel like they're
a product on a factory line.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.934
- I have techs come up to me

24:05.934 --> 24:07.967
and say, "Oh,
that's enough dialysis."

24:09.100 --> 24:10.633
"You done pulled off plenty."

24:10.633 --> 24:13.367
So, a--a wager in my mind

24:13.367 --> 24:14.900
to believe,

24:14.900 --> 24:16.667
am I getting my full treatment

24:16.667 --> 24:18.600
that I'm supposed
to be getting,

24:18.600 --> 24:20.967
just because they're behind?

24:20.967 --> 24:23.700
- Yet you can't just
speed up dialysis

24:23.700 --> 24:25.166
because you're behind schedule.

24:25.166 --> 24:28.667
It's a critical medical
procedure, not a shower.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.033
"Oh, I've only got
three minutes,

24:30.033 --> 24:31.700
"so I'm just washing
the important parts.

24:31.700 --> 24:36.033
"Hair, armpits, and penis,
'cause it's my little buddy.

24:36.033 --> 24:39.033
I'd never forget you, bud."

24:39.033 --> 24:41.066
Dialysis workers in California

24:41.066 --> 24:42.633
are currently trying
to unionize

24:42.633 --> 24:44.633
over issues including
staffing levels.

24:44.633 --> 24:47.467
And one former DaVita nurse
of more than a decade,

24:47.467 --> 24:49.700
who DaVita told us was fired
for violating company policy

24:49.700 --> 24:51.934
by asking employees
to join a union

24:51.934 --> 24:53.800
at a clinic where
he no longer worked,

24:53.800 --> 24:56.166
says workers felt
constantly pressured

24:56.166 --> 24:57.934
to transition between patients

24:57.934 --> 24:59.734
as fast as possible.

24:59.734 --> 25:01.233
- Well, when I was
working at DaVita,

25:01.233 --> 25:05.266
the priorities for, uh,
transitioning patients

25:05.266 --> 25:07.166
was to get them on dialysis

25:07.166 --> 25:11.166
and get the next patient on
as soon as possible.

25:11.166 --> 25:13.033
And it was all about numbers.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.367
You--you want to get 'em in,

25:14.367 --> 25:16.100
get their dialysis done,

25:16.100 --> 25:17.567
and get the next patient on.

25:17.567 --> 25:22.066
And you would have sometimes
15, maybe 25 minutes

25:22.066 --> 25:24.033
to get that next patient on--
on the machine,

25:24.033 --> 25:26.500
so you were not
properly disinfecting

25:26.500 --> 25:29.934
or doing the things that
you needed to do properly.

25:29.934 --> 25:33.467
- Not properly disinfecting?
That cannot be okay!

25:33.467 --> 25:35.734
I don't even want to go
into a movie theater

25:35.734 --> 25:37.567
that hasn't had enough
time to be cleaned.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.233
And the worst thing that
can happen to you there

25:39.233 --> 25:41.200
is shuffling through
a waist-deep layer

25:41.200 --> 25:43.400
of popcorn and dried,
sticky Cherry Coke.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.467
And--and look,
DaVita will tell you

25:45.467 --> 25:47.967
its clinics operate
to a high standard of care,

25:47.967 --> 25:49.400
its patients aren't rushed,

25:49.400 --> 25:51.166
they have many happy
staff and customers,

25:51.166 --> 25:53.700
and they've shown steady
improvement over the years.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.967
And they'll even point
to the high number of clinics

25:55.967 --> 25:58.266
that have received
four and five stars

25:58.266 --> 25:59.900
from the government's
rating system.

25:59.900 --> 26:03.567
But that actually points to
another oversight issue here,

26:03.567 --> 26:06.300
because weirdly, those ratings
don't reflect things

26:06.300 --> 26:09.166
like government inspection
reports for the clinics.

26:09.166 --> 26:11.200
Because remember that patient
from before?

26:11.200 --> 26:13.734
We actually pulled her clinic's
most recent report,

26:13.734 --> 26:15.200
which cited among other things

26:15.200 --> 26:18.033
multiple problems with
infection control practices

26:18.033 --> 26:21.033
and a "failure to demonstrate
over-all responsibility

26:21.033 --> 26:23.800
for the governance
and operation" of the facility,

26:23.800 --> 26:26.767
which "placed all patients,
staff, and visitors

26:26.767 --> 26:28.900
at risk of harm
and possible death."

26:28.900 --> 26:31.033
And guess how many stars it has:

26:31.033 --> 26:32.667
four stars!

26:32.667 --> 26:34.967
So that--that four-star rating

26:34.967 --> 26:37.000
should really come
with a big asterisk

26:37.000 --> 26:39.166
which, to be fair, does
technically constitute

26:39.166 --> 26:40.600
a fifth star.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.266
Congratulations.

26:43.266 --> 26:44.633
And if it's beginning to feel

26:44.633 --> 26:46.700
like DaVita is run like
a volume business,

26:46.700 --> 26:48.133
well, when you listen
to Kent Thiry,

26:48.133 --> 26:50.166
that can seem like
it's by design.

26:50.166 --> 26:53.266
Just listen to him addressing
business students at UCLA

26:53.266 --> 26:54.467
about what he sees

26:54.467 --> 26:56.900
as his company's role
in society.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.333
- I almost never
refer to patients

26:58.333 --> 27:00.300
in the entire, uh, thing,

27:00.300 --> 27:01.734
because it's--for me it's
not about the patients.

27:01.734 --> 27:03.033
It's about the teammates.

27:03.033 --> 27:04.367
When you're in health care,
it is...

27:04.367 --> 27:06.533
[stammering]
It is nicer, easier, whatever,

27:06.533 --> 27:08.734
in the sense that you're
actually very directly

27:08.734 --> 27:10.000
helping human beings.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.467
But that's--to me,
that's just not it.

27:11.467 --> 27:14.767
If I--if I had
1,400 Taco Bells,

27:14.767 --> 27:18.467
uh, and 32,000 people
who worked in them,

27:18.467 --> 27:20.000
I would--I would be doing

27:20.000 --> 27:21.834
all the same stuff.

27:21.834 --> 27:24.033
- Yes, you heard him right.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.166
He just said he manages DaVita,

27:26.166 --> 27:27.600
a health care company,

27:27.600 --> 27:29.400
like he would a Taco Bell,

27:29.400 --> 27:32.266
the exact opposite
of a health care company.

27:32.266 --> 27:33.266
Look.

27:33.266 --> 27:34.333
- Taco Bell has made a shell

27:34.333 --> 27:35.834
entirely out of fried chicken.

27:35.834 --> 27:38.166
Sounds crazy.
But is it?

27:38.166 --> 27:39.867
- So when you see
the Naked Chicken Chalupa

27:39.867 --> 27:41.934
with the first shell made
entirely out of fried chicken,

27:41.934 --> 27:43.433
you might think it's crazy.

27:43.433 --> 27:45.967
Crazy delicious.

27:45.967 --> 27:47.667
- You know,
it's a pretty safe sign

27:47.667 --> 27:49.000
that your product is awful

27:49.000 --> 27:50.800
when your commercial
has to assure people

27:50.800 --> 27:52.233
on two separate occasions,

27:52.233 --> 27:54.800
"Look,
we know we sound mentally ill,

27:54.800 --> 27:57.967
"but trust us, it is food.

27:57.967 --> 28:01.300
It's actually food.
I know, I know."

28:01.300 --> 28:03.066
And look, to be fair,

28:03.066 --> 28:05.467
DaVita might tell you
that they have to run

28:05.467 --> 28:08.033
their business so lean, because
the reimbursement they get

28:08.033 --> 28:11.100
from the government doesn't
really cover their costs.

28:11.100 --> 28:13.767
But they have been
repeatedly accused

28:13.767 --> 28:16.200
of finding innovative ways
around that.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.300
For instance, a few years ago,

28:17.300 --> 28:18.734
the company was sued

28:18.734 --> 28:21.166
over accusations it had
paid kickbacks to doctors

28:21.166 --> 28:22.600
for business.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.333
- The scheme is
kind of complicated,

28:24.333 --> 28:25.867
but it basically
works like this.

28:25.867 --> 28:28.133
DaVita would pick out doctors

28:28.133 --> 28:29.567
and physicians' groups

28:29.567 --> 28:32.133
who cared for
a large number of patients

28:32.133 --> 28:34.100
who had renal disease,

28:34.100 --> 28:36.000
and then it would offer them
lucrative deals

28:36.000 --> 28:39.266
to refer patients to
their dialysis clinics.

28:39.266 --> 28:41.400
- Okay, so that is
obviously not good.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.900
You want to be sure
that a doctor

28:42.900 --> 28:44.266
is referring you to a clinic

28:44.266 --> 28:45.900
because it's the best one
for you,

28:45.900 --> 28:48.500
not because they have
a financial relationship.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.400
You should only advocate
for a product

28:50.400 --> 28:51.567
that you really believe in,

28:51.567 --> 28:53.100
like DeWalt's ladders.

28:53.100 --> 28:56.200
They--they don't pay me
to say nice things

28:56.200 --> 28:57.667
about their products, people.

28:57.667 --> 28:58.834
Why would they?

28:58.834 --> 29:00.934
The ladders speak
for themselves.

29:00.934 --> 29:03.567
Now--now,
DaVita denies wrongdoing.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.567
But they did settle that lawsuit

29:05.567 --> 29:08.734
for $389 million,
and remember that,

29:08.734 --> 29:10.533
because it's about
to become a theme.

29:10.533 --> 29:13.533
Because in 2012,
a former medical director

29:13.533 --> 29:16.100
at a DaVita facility
went public with claims

29:16.100 --> 29:18.700
about how DaVita treated
some of the medicine

29:18.700 --> 29:20.500
that it could charge
Medicare for.

29:20.500 --> 29:24.433
For instance, let's say, uh,
a patient needed 100 milligrams

29:24.433 --> 29:25.934
of a drug called Venofer.

29:25.934 --> 29:29.967
Uh, you could give them,
say, one 100-milligram vial,

29:29.967 --> 29:32.800
or you could do this.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.200
- What DaVita did--
instead of just one vial,

29:35.200 --> 29:38.600
they gave 50 milligram
out of this vial--

29:38.600 --> 29:40.867
residual trash.

29:40.867 --> 29:45.066
25, 75 to the trash.

29:45.066 --> 29:47.467
25 again, 75 to the trash.

29:47.467 --> 29:49.300
- The more vials DaVita used,

29:49.300 --> 29:52.233
the more DaVita was able
to bill the government.

29:52.233 --> 29:55.333
- Holy shit, that is
the biggest waste of drugs

29:55.333 --> 29:58.066
since anyone who's done
cocaine in a windstorm.

29:58.066 --> 30:00.233
Although, you know what?
You know what?

30:00.233 --> 30:02.867
On the bright side,
those pigeons look confident,

30:02.867 --> 30:05.834
and they have somehow
written screenplays.

30:05.834 --> 30:07.066
There you go.

30:07.066 --> 30:10.000
That's the beauty of cocaine,
everyone.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
That's the beauty.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.967
Now--now again, again,

30:14.967 --> 30:17.233
DaVita strongly
denied wrongdoing.

30:17.233 --> 30:19.066
And they did so
even as they agreed to pay

30:19.066 --> 30:23.166
up to $495 million
to settle that case.

30:23.166 --> 30:26.100
That's an almost
half-a-billion-dollar oops.

30:26.100 --> 30:27.600
Or as Yankees fans call it,

30:27.600 --> 30:28.767
an A-Rod.

30:28.767 --> 30:32.133
Uh, and a--and a separate case

30:32.133 --> 30:34.500
accused them not so much
of throwing extra drugs

30:34.500 --> 30:37.033
into the trash
as throwing them into patients.

30:37.033 --> 30:39.367
And then involved something
called Epogen,

30:39.367 --> 30:41.367
a medication used
to raise a patient's

30:41.367 --> 30:43.066
red blood cell count.

30:43.066 --> 30:44.867
A whistleblower said
the DaVita personnel

30:44.867 --> 30:46.967
referred to it as "liquid gold."

30:46.967 --> 30:48.266
And with good reason.

30:48.266 --> 30:50.300
At one point,
it accounted for a quarter

30:50.300 --> 30:51.867
of the company's revenue

30:51.867 --> 30:54.567
and up to 40% of its earnings,

30:54.567 --> 30:56.200
although it was
later discovered

30:56.200 --> 30:58.000
that at the higher dosage levels

30:58.000 --> 30:59.166
that DaVita was using,

30:59.166 --> 31:01.100
there was no solid evidence

31:01.100 --> 31:03.200
that Epogen made people
feel better,

31:03.200 --> 31:07.133
improved survival, or had
any clinical benefit at all,

31:07.133 --> 31:09.734
which is incidentally
also the new tagline

31:09.734 --> 31:11.567
for this television show,

31:11.567 --> 31:12.800
and it seems fair.

31:12.800 --> 31:16.233
It seems harsh
but increasingly fair.

31:16.233 --> 31:19.266
And--and I--I think you know
what is coming now.

31:19.266 --> 31:21.333
DaVita denied any wrongdoing

31:21.333 --> 31:24.767
and settled that lawsuit
for $55 million.

31:24.767 --> 31:26.633
And DaVita will say that
they keep settling cases

31:26.633 --> 31:29.000
because they can't afford
to get shut out from Medicare,

31:29.000 --> 31:30.233
but the fact remains,

31:30.233 --> 31:32.333
just the three cases
I have mentioned

31:32.333 --> 31:35.266
in the last five years have
resulted in them paying out

31:35.266 --> 31:38.033
nearly a billion dollars
in settlements.

31:38.033 --> 31:39.834
And that doesn't exactly
give you confidence

31:39.834 --> 31:41.066
in their product.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.834
If the Fleshlight company

31:42.834 --> 31:45.200
paid a billion dollars
in settlements,

31:45.200 --> 31:47.100
you would do what
everyone else does,

31:47.100 --> 31:49.433
and you would fuck
a microwaved cantaloupe.

31:49.433 --> 31:52.333
Yeah, 30 seconds on defrost.
Trust me.

31:52.333 --> 31:54.767
30 seconds.
30 seconds.

31:54.767 --> 31:56.633
No more, but no less.

31:56.633 --> 32:00.300
30 seconds is the sweet spot.
Ding, business time.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.567
But forget that.
What was the point?

32:02.567 --> 32:05.533
The point is, here is where
we get to the final

32:05.533 --> 32:07.800
and possibly the hardest
part of this story,

32:07.800 --> 32:10.533
because the fact is, no matter
what standard of care you get,

32:10.533 --> 32:12.567
the longer you are on dialysis,

32:12.567 --> 32:14.900
the worse things look for you.

32:14.900 --> 32:17.600
- People who are on dialysis,
how long are they gonna last?

32:17.600 --> 32:19.900
- Right, so the statistics
are that

32:19.900 --> 32:22.000
one year after being
on dialysis,

32:22.000 --> 32:25.066
your--your death rate is 25%.

32:25.066 --> 32:27.867
By five years, it's 65%.

32:27.867 --> 32:29.767
- And numbers like that are why

32:29.767 --> 32:32.433
if you are at all eligible
to get a kidney transplant,

32:32.433 --> 32:34.400
you absolutely should get one.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.734
It can double or even triple
your survival rate.

32:37.734 --> 32:40.200
And yet the government's
main requirement

32:40.200 --> 32:42.567
for dialysis clinics
in educating patients

32:42.567 --> 32:45.500
about transplants is that
they simply check a box

32:45.500 --> 32:47.300
indicating that they've done so.

32:47.300 --> 32:49.867
And multiple studies
of the industry

32:49.867 --> 32:53.433
have questioned the quality
of some clinics' education.

32:53.433 --> 32:55.734
- Thousands of kidney patients
in the United States

32:55.734 --> 32:58.700
start dialysis without
first being told

32:58.700 --> 33:00.100
about kidney transplants

33:00.100 --> 33:01.533
or that the procedure
would be cheaper

33:01.533 --> 33:02.967
and lead to longer lives.

33:02.967 --> 33:04.533
The newspaper reviewed records

33:04.533 --> 33:06.567
from the United States
Renal Data System

33:06.567 --> 33:08.900
and they found that some
patients spent five years

33:08.900 --> 33:12.800
on dialysis before being put
on the kidney transplant list.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.533
- It's true, some clinics
are leaving out information

33:15.533 --> 33:17.266
that people really should know.

33:17.266 --> 33:20.100
And information on transplants
at a dialysis clinic

33:20.100 --> 33:23.533
is a bit like information about
the number of ferrets you own

33:23.533 --> 33:24.934
while you're on a Tinder date.

33:24.934 --> 33:27.900
You need to disclose that shit
right up front

33:27.900 --> 33:30.367
so that people don't make
a huge mistake.

33:30.367 --> 33:32.467
You have to do that.
You have to do that.

33:32.467 --> 33:35.767
It's not right!
You disclose that shit!

33:35.767 --> 33:39.500
You let her know!
What's wrong with you?

33:39.500 --> 33:42.200
And--and look, DaVita disputes

33:42.200 --> 33:44.400
that those studies
reflect their practices,

33:44.400 --> 33:46.867
saying that, uh, their
most recent internal figures

33:46.867 --> 33:48.533
show them outperforming
their competitors

33:48.533 --> 33:51.266
in percentage of patients
receiving a transplant,

33:51.266 --> 33:52.767
although for what it is worth,

33:52.767 --> 33:54.166
we wanted to get a glimpse

33:54.166 --> 33:56.100
of what their education
might look like,

33:56.100 --> 33:58.133
and honestly, it wasn't great.

33:58.133 --> 34:00.400
DaVita offers
Kidney Smart classes,

34:00.400 --> 34:03.000
basically orientation
for pre-dialysis patients.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.166
And they're open to the public,
so we sent four staffers,

34:06.166 --> 34:08.800
uh, to classes
at four different clinics

34:08.800 --> 34:10.900
here in New York,
and they were all struck

34:10.900 --> 34:12.600
by how little emphasis
was placed

34:12.600 --> 34:14.667
on the benefits of transplants

34:14.667 --> 34:16.100
and that they were
often presented

34:16.100 --> 34:18.467
as an equivalent choice
to dialysis.

34:18.467 --> 34:21.433
In fact, here is what happened
when one staffer asked

34:21.433 --> 34:24.800
specifically about whether
people who came to that clinic

34:24.800 --> 34:26.333
sought transplants.

34:59.934 --> 35:01.233
- Okay, okay.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.367
Suggesting that
the cozy atmosphere

35:03.367 --> 35:05.166
of a DaVita dialysis center

35:05.166 --> 35:08.033
is a valid reason to turn down
a kidney transplant

35:08.033 --> 35:10.066
is the moral equivalent
of watching someone

35:10.066 --> 35:12.400
tread water in the middle
of the ocean

35:12.400 --> 35:15.400
and not encouraging him
to take a fucking rope.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.834
"Are you sure?

35:16.834 --> 35:19.266
"Are you sure the ocean
isn't your 'community'?

35:19.266 --> 35:21.166
"Are you sure you want the--

35:21.166 --> 35:23.367
"people have turned down
this rope before, you know.

35:23.367 --> 35:26.467
There's no bad decision here."

35:26.467 --> 35:28.533
And look, we focused on DaVita

35:28.533 --> 35:30.100
because they have
the most patients

35:30.100 --> 35:33.266
and Kent Thiry dresses
like an idiot all the time.

35:33.266 --> 35:36.333
But a lot of the problems
we've seen run throughout

35:36.333 --> 35:38.133
the for-profit
dialysis industry,

35:38.133 --> 35:40.800
including their main
competitor, Fresenius,

35:40.800 --> 35:44.333
who just last year agreed to
a $250 million settlement

35:44.333 --> 35:45.767
for thousands of lawsuits

35:45.767 --> 35:47.734
claiming that the company's
products had caused

35:47.734 --> 35:49.133
heart problems and deaths,

35:49.133 --> 35:51.600
claims that they deny,
because, you know,

35:51.600 --> 35:53.200
of course they do.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.667
So here's the thing.

35:54.667 --> 35:57.000
I know that all of this
has been very complicated.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.600
But there--there are actually
a few key lessons here.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.734
First, we need to make sure
that dialysis clinics

36:02.734 --> 36:04.033
have better oversight.

36:04.033 --> 36:06.233
And we need to create
better incentives

36:06.233 --> 36:09.467
for transplants and for
treating kidney disease earlier

36:09.467 --> 36:12.800
to keep patients out of dialysis
in the first place.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.400
And there are things
that everyone can do

36:14.400 --> 36:16.033
to combat the kidney shortage.

36:16.033 --> 36:19.500
Truly amazing people can donate
one of their own kidneys

36:19.500 --> 36:20.900
while they're still alive,

36:20.900 --> 36:23.300
and if you are someone
considering doing that,

36:23.300 --> 36:26.233
holy shit,
you're an amazing human being.

36:26.233 --> 36:29.300
Feel free to go
to giveandlive.us

36:29.300 --> 36:31.166
for more information on that.

36:31.166 --> 36:33.300
And for the rest of us
complete assholes,

36:33.300 --> 36:36.333
uh, we should at least--
at the very least--

36:36.333 --> 36:38.033
be organ donors when we die.

36:38.033 --> 36:39.900
'Cause organs can go to waste

36:39.900 --> 36:41.834
as families hesitate
to give approval

36:41.834 --> 36:43.200
when a loved one dies.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.100
So please, please make sure

36:45.100 --> 36:47.967
that your family knows
that you want to be a donor.

36:47.967 --> 36:50.100
And once you've done that,
maybe tweet out...

36:52.867 --> 36:55.400
'Cause if nothing else,
it will really fuck with

36:55.400 --> 36:57.967
Twitter's trending
topics tomorrow.

36:57.967 --> 36:59.633
But--but here's the thing.

36:59.633 --> 37:02.633
This country did
a truly amazing thing.

37:02.633 --> 37:04.734
Richard Nixon did a truly--
- Whoo!

37:04.734 --> 37:06.433
- Really?
Wow.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.333
History has changed.

37:08.333 --> 37:11.867
Richard Nixon did
a truly amazing thing.

37:11.867 --> 37:15.467
He--he said we should take care
of people with kidney disease,

37:15.467 --> 37:16.500
and we did it.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.767
And we should keep doing it,

37:17.767 --> 37:19.900
but--but we could do it
a lot better.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.900
The care of America's kidneys

37:21.900 --> 37:23.433
is way too important

37:23.433 --> 37:25.500
to be treated like
a fast food experience,

37:25.500 --> 37:26.867
which--which actually
reminds me,

37:26.867 --> 37:29.233
there is another victim
of this story,

37:29.233 --> 37:30.934
and that is Taco Bell.

37:30.934 --> 37:32.367
Yes, that's right.

37:32.367 --> 37:34.467
Taco Bell is owed an apology,

37:34.467 --> 37:37.233
and that sentence has
never before made sense

37:37.233 --> 37:38.734
in the English language.

37:38.734 --> 37:41.433
But Taco Bell, I am truly sorry

37:41.433 --> 37:44.400
that a middle-aged musketeer
dragged you into this.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.734
And I know that you're not
gonna stand up for yourselves,

37:46.734 --> 37:47.800
Taco Bell.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.300
You're too busy plotting
your next

37:49.300 --> 37:51.000
Kristallnacht
for the bowels.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.600
So--so don't worry.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.967
Take it easy.

37:54.967 --> 37:56.467
We've prepared a commercial

37:56.467 --> 37:58.033
to return fire for you.

37:58.033 --> 37:59.734
Please enjoy.

37:59.734 --> 38:01.500
- Hi, we're Taco Bell.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.867
You may know us from
Volcano Nachos,

38:03.867 --> 38:05.433
the Beefy Fritos Burrito,

38:05.433 --> 38:07.734
and that taco with
fried chicken for a shell.

38:07.734 --> 38:09.133
Take it from us...

38:09.133 --> 38:10.734
- You don't want to run
a health care business

38:10.734 --> 38:11.967
like a Taco Bell.

38:11.967 --> 38:13.266
[together]
No.

38:13.266 --> 38:14.533
- To be honest,
you shouldn't really

38:14.533 --> 38:16.400
run a Taco Bell
like a Taco Bell.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.867
[together]
No shit.

38:17.867 --> 38:20.467
- Because we're nothing
like dialysis clinics.

38:20.467 --> 38:23.100
For a start, you may actually
be more likely

38:23.100 --> 38:24.700
to find a doctor
in one of our restaurants

38:24.700 --> 38:26.433
than in a dialysis clinic.

38:26.433 --> 38:29.233
- Shit.
Can you blur my face?

38:29.233 --> 38:30.867
- Sure.
- And the Crunchwrap?

38:30.867 --> 38:32.834
- Fuck yeah we can.
- Oh, nice.

38:32.834 --> 38:34.800
- And look, we've certainly
made our fair share

38:34.800 --> 38:36.233
of dubious claims.

38:36.233 --> 38:38.400
You know those breakfast
burritos in our ads?

38:38.400 --> 38:40.533
This is what one
actually looks like.

38:40.533 --> 38:42.100
Gross.

38:42.100 --> 38:44.100
But we sure as shit haven't
spent the last few years

38:44.100 --> 38:47.400
paying out nearly a billion
dollars to settle lawsuits,

38:47.400 --> 38:49.867
because we run a tight ship
at Taco Bell.

38:49.867 --> 38:52.066
- If I lick the dust off
the Doritos taco shells,

38:52.066 --> 38:54.433
they become regular taco shells.

38:54.433 --> 38:55.834
[rock music]

38:55.834 --> 38:58.133
- Okay, uh,
the important thing is,

38:58.133 --> 39:00.900
our food may be barely fit
for human consumption,

39:00.900 --> 39:04.000
but at least our CEO dresses
in a suit like a human person.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.667
And he doesn't make us
call him "the mayor"

39:05.667 --> 39:08.166
or do any of that weird
musketeer nonsense.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.667
And you know why?

39:09.667 --> 39:12.333
- We're a company,
not a child's birthday party.

39:12.333 --> 39:13.900
- Exactly.

39:13.900 --> 39:15.900
And while our food may be
medically inadvisable,

39:15.900 --> 39:17.667
even we know that if you can,

39:17.667 --> 39:19.700
you should get
a kidney transplant.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.033
- Oh, you know, yeah, yeah,

39:21.033 --> 39:22.700
you should absolutely get
a kidney transplant.

39:22.700 --> 39:24.467
- Yeah, no shit.

39:24.467 --> 39:26.834
- How'd you get back here?
- Hm?

39:26.834 --> 39:28.000
[bell dings]

39:32.000 --> 39:33.667
- That's our show.
Thanks so much for watching.

39:33.667 --> 39:35.233
See you next week.
Good night.

39:35.233 --> 39:37.400
[cheers and applause]

39:37.400 --> 39:44.433
