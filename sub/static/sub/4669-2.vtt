00:21.237 --> 00:22.671
Hand me the syringe.

00:23.563 --> 00:25.741
If they manage to get the
cure from Kara's unborn baby,

00:25.775 --> 00:27.070
they will absolutely kill her

00:27.095 --> 00:29.185
and everyone aboard
the <i>Nathan James</i>.

00:31.793 --> 00:33.308
Can they really get that from a baby?

00:33.333 --> 00:35.073
Yes, they can.

00:43.935 --> 00:45.117
We're almost there, boss.

00:45.142 --> 00:47.122
- Outstanding.
- Ready?

00:47.529 --> 00:49.359
Sun's been down for 30 minutes.

00:49.384 --> 00:50.644
It's dark enough.

00:51.491 --> 00:52.911
Let's turn out the lights.

00:52.936 --> 00:54.110
Pass word on to Green.

00:54.134 --> 00:55.349
Roger that.

01:26.075 --> 01:28.094
Was that a scheduled shutdown?

01:28.355 --> 01:29.415
I'm not sure, ma'am.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.696
Vasquez.

01:31.705 --> 01:33.885
Avocet Power, come in.

01:33.910 --> 01:36.060
Avocet Power, what's going on?

01:36.085 --> 01:37.395
Baltimore Water and Power.

01:37.420 --> 01:38.850
How can I help you this evening?

01:38.875 --> 01:40.495
The current hold tie is forever.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.210
If you need immediate assistance,

01:42.235 --> 01:44.805
please place your lips
firmly on my ass cheeks

01:44.830 --> 01:46.514
and press the pound sign.

01:48.539 --> 01:50.898
Yeah. That ought to get a rise out of her.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.156
- Secure this building.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.977
And send as many troopers as
you can to the power plant.

01:57.002 --> 01:59.112
Take reinforcements from
the ship, if you have to.

01:59.137 --> 02:01.665
I want the power back on immediately.

02:01.690 --> 02:03.633
- Copy that.
- Alisha!

02:04.630 --> 02:07.088
Go and get her.

02:12.101 --> 02:14.233
There's been an attack on the power plant.

02:14.376 --> 02:15.776
We need troops outside.

02:16.334 --> 02:19.361
Outside right now! All right,
everybody. To your positions.

02:19.386 --> 02:20.937
Got it! Stay here.

02:22.221 --> 02:24.074
Grab a lamp. We're gonna finish this.

02:30.249 --> 02:31.392
Move.

02:31.983 --> 02:33.192
Wait here.

02:43.117 --> 02:44.871
The Avocet vans are leaving.

02:45.055 --> 02:47.175
All right, Detective, you're on.

02:47.515 --> 02:48.930
All right, men, come on!

02:49.230 --> 02:51.189
Let's move! Let's move!

02:51.759 --> 02:53.119
Fire in the hole.

03:09.654 --> 03:11.835
Okay, okay.

03:50.212 --> 03:51.554
Okay.

03:59.578 --> 04:01.939
- Get away from the girl!
- Don't shoot her!

04:01.964 --> 04:04.484
Hands on your head! Get
down on your knees, now!

04:04.781 --> 04:05.843
Kara!

04:06.015 --> 04:07.403
I'm so sorry.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.692
Okay, we're gonna get
you out of here. Okay.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.529
Let's get you out of these.

04:12.140 --> 04:13.261
Let's get moving.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.805
Startin' to leave a lot of bodies behind.

04:14.849 --> 04:16.559
All right. I've got her.

04:16.584 --> 04:18.269
Go, go, go, go, go.

04:19.016 --> 04:20.254
Go.

04:48.612 --> 04:51.392
I'm sending a helo and
two boats back to town.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.703
I say again... the
power plant has been hit.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.278
I want all available assets
off the ship and headed back.

04:56.303 --> 04:58.055
- Copy that.
- On Granderson's orders.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.351
Understood.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.195
Tom.

05:56.015 --> 05:57.351
- What's going on?
- Shh.

05:57.376 --> 06:00.919
- Get over to the power plant, now!
- Copy that. Let's go.

06:05.061 --> 06:06.861
They're leaving the armory. No more guards.

06:06.886 --> 06:07.583
Why?

06:07.916 --> 06:09.159
I don't know. I don't care.

06:09.184 --> 06:10.214
Now's our chance.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.055
All right, that's enough stretching.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.391
Sit down.

06:43.143 --> 06:44.494
I said sit down!

06:44.519 --> 06:45.979
Get 'em in their seats.

06:55.079 --> 06:56.413
Ma'am.

06:57.252 --> 06:59.698
You said there'll come a time.

07:04.752 --> 07:06.382
I think it's about that time.

07:19.039 --> 07:19.889
Move. Move.

07:21.547 --> 07:22.783
Go.

07:25.290 --> 07:27.209
Right. Left.

07:28.727 --> 07:30.065
Right there.

07:30.604 --> 07:31.929
Clear.

07:35.232 --> 07:36.999
Granderson's command
center's on the top floor.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.609
You take the east wing,
we'll take the west,

07:38.634 --> 07:39.940
Work our way up.

07:47.268 --> 07:48.306
Be safe.

07:48.331 --> 07:50.850
I didn't come all this
way to die in Baltimore.

08:39.779 --> 08:41.256
Armory.

08:43.332 --> 08:45.238
My boys.

08:57.936 --> 09:00.167
All right, take five
guys. Cover the east wing.

09:00.192 --> 09:01.824
Secure the lab. I'll see you up top.

09:01.849 --> 09:03.567
Roger that. Let's go.

09:10.171 --> 09:12.494
Ma'am, we have a security breach.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.169
Shots fired inside the building.

09:14.271 --> 09:15.840
Hamada is dead.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.163
The pregnant sailor and
Dr. Scott are missing.

09:18.188 --> 09:19.108
And my daughter?

09:19.133 --> 09:20.444
No sign of her yet.

09:36.530 --> 09:38.083
Seal all exits!

09:38.108 --> 09:39.718
No one gets in or out of the building!

09:39.743 --> 09:40.819
Find my daughter.

09:40.845 --> 09:42.178
Yes, ma'am.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.554
All right, we got to move.

09:47.765 --> 09:50.747
Fire escape's across the
roof behind the A/C unit.

09:52.233 --> 09:53.515
Are you doing all right?

09:53.540 --> 09:54.640
I'm fine. I'm fine.

09:55.127 --> 09:56.490
Wait there.

09:58.116 --> 10:00.429
You two, understood? I want eyes on them.

10:00.983 --> 10:02.090
What?

10:02.115 --> 10:03.671
- Change of plans.
- What is it?

10:03.696 --> 10:05.276
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

10:05.301 --> 10:07.044
Go, go.

10:10.718 --> 10:12.757
Don't know how many there are.

10:12.782 --> 10:14.091
No sign of them from overhead.

10:14.116 --> 10:15.899
Get the power back up.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.818
Fan out. Get to the main unit.

10:20.843 --> 10:21.803
How many are there?

10:21.828 --> 10:23.051
I counted three.

11:16.595 --> 11:17.858
Up there.

11:18.196 --> 11:19.726
Somebody's watching us.

11:19.751 --> 11:20.911
Damn. We got comms.

11:28.171 --> 11:30.140
Mess decks, night vision.

12:12.050 --> 12:12.650
Clear!

12:12.650 --> 12:13.500
Clear!

12:13.500 --> 12:14.220
Clear!

12:17.760 --> 12:19.390
Everyone okay? Anyone hit?

12:19.980 --> 12:21.550
Any more where you came from, sailor?

12:21.550 --> 12:22.730
Ma'am, there's someone in comms.

12:22.730 --> 12:25.000
Don't know who, but
he's looking out for us.

12:25.373 --> 12:27.523
Got some goodies for
you. Everyone, take one.

12:27.730 --> 12:30.560
All right, listen up.
You all know the drill.

12:30.560 --> 12:33.030
We flush them up, out, and back aft.

12:33.030 --> 12:34.140
Let's go, sailors.

12:34.140 --> 12:35.700
Everyone to your battle stations.

12:35.710 --> 12:37.064
Time to fight!

12:38.010 --> 12:39.200
Thatababy.

12:39.690 --> 12:44.400
Okay, boys, let's take back our ship.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.270
I grabbed some antibiotics,
in case we need 'em.

12:55.270 --> 12:57.820
You use them for your arm, Master Chief.

12:57.890 --> 12:59.400
Your wound's opened up again.

12:59.580 --> 13:00.690
I'm fine.

13:03.890 --> 13:06.010
Looks like the power's
out all over the street.

13:08.470 --> 13:09.890
That's my son's doing.

13:10.159 --> 13:11.249
I'm sure of it.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.140
Grandpa.

13:17.321 --> 13:19.431
That's an Avocet van. Someone's coming.

13:19.456 --> 13:21.576
Blow out the candles. Keep an eye out.

13:24.290 --> 13:25.280
Get down, Ash.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.605
Kids, come over here.

13:26.630 --> 13:28.610
Get down.

13:33.966 --> 13:35.241
Is that the place?

13:35.266 --> 13:36.880
You gonna pay me?

13:41.820 --> 13:43.560
I got twice as many rations last time.

13:43.560 --> 13:44.980
Can I at least get some water?

13:45.260 --> 13:46.840
Come on, man. I'm giving you good leads.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.960
This whole neighborhood would
be full of sickies without me.

13:48.970 --> 13:50.175
Get lost.

13:51.062 --> 13:52.598
Call for backup.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.219
Is anyone in there?!

14:48.244 --> 14:49.673
We're here to help you!

15:12.180 --> 15:14.321
AAH!

15:24.187 --> 15:25.715
There are gonna be more
where these guys came from.

15:25.740 --> 15:27.110
We can't stay here.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.115
Let's go.

15:41.170 --> 15:42.880
Hey, Commodore.

15:46.566 --> 15:48.306
What's Lieutenant Foster doing with you?

15:48.331 --> 15:50.971
Crazy witch doctor tried
to get the cure from Kara.

15:51.698 --> 15:53.635
I killed him, sir.

15:56.884 --> 15:58.312
You okay?

15:58.590 --> 16:02.026
I'm fine. Quincy's dead.

16:04.283 --> 16:06.153
Can your men help get them out of here?

16:07.678 --> 16:08.798
Take them.

16:09.860 --> 16:10.850
On me.

16:19.090 --> 16:20.990
Go right! Go right!

16:22.100 --> 16:23.270
Move in!

16:23.650 --> 16:26.743
Go! Go! Cover me.

16:28.119 --> 16:29.069
Go.

16:32.135 --> 16:34.455
The Navy's in the building
with Thorwald's men.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.926
They came in through the basement.

16:36.820 --> 16:39.201
Ma'am, I think we should
call back the chopper

16:39.226 --> 16:40.526
and get you out of here.

16:41.190 --> 16:42.910
Do you think we're giving up?

16:43.418 --> 16:44.883
No, ma'am.

16:49.700 --> 16:53.070
Get me the power plant. I
want to know what's going on.

17:08.750 --> 17:09.690
Jimmy.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.859
Thorwald.

17:15.730 --> 17:16.910
You're a cop.

17:17.589 --> 17:19.020
You don't belong here.

17:20.030 --> 17:21.780
You really don't get it.

17:32.970 --> 17:33.930
Kara!

17:34.250 --> 17:35.600
Wait. Take it.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.300
Go on. I'll catch up.

17:37.300 --> 17:37.940
What?!

17:37.940 --> 17:39.650
That's an order. Get safe.

17:39.650 --> 17:40.700
Te...

17:42.040 --> 17:43.840
"That's an order." Jesus.

17:43.950 --> 17:45.300
All right, let's go this way.

17:54.220 --> 17:55.016
What's your count?

17:55.041 --> 17:57.152
I got 67 of them in the cafeteria.

17:57.890 --> 17:58.880
Copy that.

17:59.850 --> 18:01.500
Find another way to Granderson.

18:01.525 --> 18:03.375
I got to get these people out of here.

18:09.734 --> 18:11.940
Copy that.

18:12.766 --> 18:13.766
Aah!

18:14.300 --> 18:16.300
United States Navy! We're
gettin' ya out of here!

18:16.325 --> 18:17.650
Everyone, come on!

18:17.675 --> 18:19.281
In here! Come on!

18:19.368 --> 18:20.738
Come on! Go!

18:20.763 --> 18:22.865
Come on! Come on!

18:28.450 --> 18:29.150
Lab is secure.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.100
Say again, lab is secure.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.090
We've got Dr. Scott in pocket.

18:33.090 --> 18:35.215
Lieutenant Green, what is your sitrep?

18:38.555 --> 18:40.355
Sir, I can't hold them off much longer.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.400
All right. Get out of there.

18:52.420 --> 18:54.140
I'm running out of ammo!

18:54.420 --> 18:56.130
Get out of there! That is a direct order!

18:56.130 --> 18:58.030
- Move, now!
- Roger that!

19:00.600 --> 19:01.665
Shit.

19:30.856 --> 19:32.566
Don't move.

19:33.696 --> 19:34.973
Okay!

19:43.960 --> 19:45.590
Wh-where are we going?

19:46.080 --> 19:47.720
We still have the primary rally point.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.730
We can wait there.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.730
Vulture team, I'm on
foot. I'm being pursued.

19:50.730 --> 19:53.440
I say again, I have at least
six troopers on my tail.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.272
And I don't want to bring them your way.

19:58.835 --> 20:00.575
I'm gonna swing back around at Saratoga

20:00.600 --> 20:02.785
And... where am I?... Fremont.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.420
Saratoga and Fremont!

20:06.269 --> 20:08.509
Master Chief, we have two vans now.

20:08.534 --> 20:10.274
You take one. I'll take the other.

20:10.299 --> 20:12.199
I promised the captain I'd look after you.

20:12.224 --> 20:13.444
And you did.

20:13.591 --> 20:14.931
I got it from here.

20:14.956 --> 20:16.586
We'll meet you at the rally point.

20:16.720 --> 20:17.910
I still know how to hide

20:17.920 --> 20:19.300
and I still know how to fight.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.360
Go. Help your shipmates.

20:22.710 --> 20:24.805
Lieutenant Green, Cobra
Team. I've got wheels

20:24.830 --> 20:26.554
and can have eyes on you
in less than five minutes.

20:26.579 --> 20:27.649
Hang tight.

20:28.206 --> 20:29.272
Good luck.

20:29.420 --> 20:30.820
All right, kids, get in the van.

20:31.328 --> 20:33.155
Come on, quick!

20:34.010 --> 20:35.384
Come on. Let's go.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.336
Go. They're gone.

20:39.270 --> 20:40.420
Nicely intercepted.

20:40.580 --> 20:43.180
Get the main unit up.
All right, check it out.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.180
I'm trying. Give me a second.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.880
All right, good.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.560
Okay, go. Check it.

20:48.950 --> 20:52.630
Power up in 5, 4, 3...

20:52.655 --> 20:53.896
Power up.

20:54.924 --> 20:56.481
Good. It's on.

20:59.777 --> 21:01.686
Gloria, get to the other post.

21:04.470 --> 21:08.425
Attention people of Avocet,
we are under attack...

21:08.450 --> 21:09.985
Keep coming. Try to stay together.

21:10.010 --> 21:12.077
From rogue elements of the military.

21:12.102 --> 21:13.686
We are under attack!

21:13.712 --> 21:16.122
If you see a Navy uniform,

21:16.147 --> 21:17.702
- Don't be fooled.
- Keep coming.

21:17.727 --> 21:20.115
- Try to stay in this room.
- They've sabotaged our water supply.

21:20.140 --> 21:21.388
There. That's one of 'em.

21:21.413 --> 21:24.285
No. I am a member of the U.S. Navy.

21:24.309 --> 21:25.671
- I'm here to help you.
- We are all warriors now.

21:25.696 --> 21:27.585
- I repeat, this is Amy Granderson.
- Get her!

21:27.610 --> 21:31.070
- No.
- Get her. Get her!

21:31.095 --> 21:32.934
We are under attack.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.499
I repeat, we are under attack.

21:35.524 --> 21:36.794
Stop right there!

21:37.116 --> 21:38.625
- Don't be fooled.
- Listen to me.

21:38.650 --> 21:41.120
There are hundreds of innocent
people in the building.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.230
They are in danger.

21:42.255 --> 21:44.517
We have to help them, get them out of here.

21:44.542 --> 21:46.052
We are under attack.

21:46.077 --> 21:48.261
They've infiltrated our power plant.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.502
We must fight to take what's ours.

21:55.331 --> 21:58.542
We must fight to defend
everything we've built.

22:08.838 --> 22:10.298
Radios down.

22:10.323 --> 22:11.983
We'll link up on the lower level.

22:18.409 --> 22:19.869
Thanks, Master Chief.

22:19.894 --> 22:21.154
Anytime, sir.

22:43.199 --> 22:44.429
They're not fighting.

22:44.454 --> 22:46.274
They're running away!

22:46.775 --> 22:49.076
Ma'am, people are just trying
to get out of the cross fire.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.371
I don't want them out of the cross fire.

22:53.408 --> 22:55.818
We're not making this
easy for Captain Chandler.

22:55.930 --> 22:58.220
Nobody leaves the building. See to it.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.080
Go.

22:59.105 --> 23:00.413
Yes, ma'am.

23:01.990 --> 23:03.910
- Got it. Got it. Clear. Clear.
- Just hang in there.

23:03.976 --> 23:04.886
You'll be okay.

23:04.911 --> 23:08.164
- Green, that you?
- She's lost a lot of blood, sir.

23:09.166 --> 23:11.200
Captain.

23:12.230 --> 23:14.065
I had no idea.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.421
You have to believe me.

23:16.446 --> 23:19.106
I know, Lieutenant. I know.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.151
Clark!

23:22.470 --> 23:23.490
We got to move her.

23:23.490 --> 23:26.330
She's not gonna make it, not
till we close this wound up.

23:26.420 --> 23:28.730
You got people in the
tunnels. Can they help?

23:28.750 --> 23:30.160
- Follow me.
- All right. Get her out of here.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.360
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Up.

23:33.230 --> 23:36.330
I got you. I got you. Here we go.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.380
You're gonna be okay.

23:40.430 --> 23:42.140
Get back! Get back, now!

23:42.140 --> 23:42.860
Let us go!

23:42.860 --> 23:44.070
Everybody, stay back!

23:44.070 --> 23:44.970
They're gonna kill us!

23:44.970 --> 23:46.575
Nobody leaves!

23:51.740 --> 23:54.272
Get your asses out of here.
Come on, come on, come on.

23:59.580 --> 24:00.932
Now.

24:22.860 --> 24:24.068
Barker.

24:27.710 --> 24:29.318
Barker.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.655
Cover me!

24:57.340 --> 24:59.000
Come on, boys.

25:31.486 --> 25:32.740
Cover me.

25:54.316 --> 25:55.801
Yeah!

25:57.270 --> 25:59.193
Smokin' and sinkin'!

26:20.210 --> 26:21.975
I found Dr. Scott at the tunnel entrance.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.875
She's secure. She was
with Lieutenant Foster.

26:24.900 --> 26:26.133
Kara?

26:26.158 --> 26:28.548
Just hang on, baby girl. We're
getting you back to the ship.

26:28.573 --> 26:30.303
No, I can't go back. I can't go back.

26:30.328 --> 26:32.108
I got it from here. You're clear. Go. Go!

26:32.133 --> 26:35.213
No. I can't. I can't go back.

26:35.627 --> 26:37.486
Not to the ship.

26:50.808 --> 26:52.168
Andrew.

26:52.891 --> 26:53.915
Amy.

26:54.199 --> 26:55.989
Gonna read me my rights?

26:56.900 --> 26:59.850
No, and I forgot to bring my handcuffs.

27:00.561 --> 27:02.681
Hoping I'd go without a fight?

27:02.835 --> 27:05.045
Not your style. Why change now?

27:06.420 --> 27:08.990
The things we could've done for this city.

27:10.150 --> 27:11.620
We didn't have to be enemies.

27:11.620 --> 27:13.280
Yeah, we did.

27:14.250 --> 27:15.350
Oh, well.

27:23.622 --> 27:26.481
Ma'am, time to go.

27:33.340 --> 27:35.440
Sailors are out and fighting on the ship!

27:35.460 --> 27:37.330
Someone took control of their cameras!

27:37.955 --> 27:39.635
- Who?
- The hell if I know.

27:39.660 --> 27:41.290
We're getting hit from all sides!

27:43.130 --> 27:44.630
Son of a bitch!

29:05.548 --> 29:06.858
Roof.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.330
She's headed for the roof.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.890
Attention, people of Baltimore.

29:26.325 --> 29:30.065
U.S.S. <i>Nathan James</i> is
back under the control of her crew.

29:30.090 --> 29:31.664
- Let's go.
- This ship is now engaged

29:31.689 --> 29:35.372
in the fight to free
Baltimore and spread the cure

29:35.397 --> 29:37.937
of the red flu to all of its citizens.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.120
This message goes out to Amy Granderson

29:42.145 --> 29:44.266
and all those loyal to her.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.495
Nathan James has been liberated

29:46.520 --> 29:48.450
and has joined the fight against you.

29:48.475 --> 29:50.685
We demand your immediate surrender.

29:50.710 --> 29:52.400
Lay down your arms...

29:54.180 --> 29:55.991
or be subject to the full force

29:56.016 --> 29:58.356
of the United States Navy.

30:05.655 --> 30:07.465
How far out is the helicopter?

30:07.490 --> 30:09.619
- Two minutes away, ma'am.
- Secure the plant.

30:09.644 --> 30:11.810
Head back to base. And where is Norris?

30:11.835 --> 30:13.775
Norris is dead by now.

30:15.790 --> 30:18.650
You want to be the last
to die for a lost cause?

30:20.175 --> 30:21.925
What are you doing? Shoot him!

30:21.950 --> 30:24.490
There are 200 more where I came from.

30:25.940 --> 30:27.620
You heard my X.O.

30:27.645 --> 30:29.545
We've taken back our ship,

30:29.790 --> 30:31.745
this building is ours,

30:31.770 --> 30:33.605
and we're telling the people of Baltimore

30:33.630 --> 30:35.456
that your killing zone at Olympia

30:35.481 --> 30:36.844
is out of business.

30:37.432 --> 30:39.142
You have two choices...

30:40.532 --> 30:41.894
a trial...

30:42.555 --> 30:43.945
or a funeral.

30:48.369 --> 30:50.049
I gave you a direct order.

30:50.074 --> 30:51.144
Shoot.

30:56.456 --> 30:58.850
I am not going anywhere with you.

30:58.875 --> 31:00.255
I found your daughter

31:00.280 --> 31:02.527
lying in a pool of her own blood,

31:02.552 --> 31:06.753
Shot by your guards, under your order!

31:09.058 --> 31:10.672
My children

31:11.627 --> 31:13.887
were lined up to be murdered

31:14.014 --> 31:15.894
and sent to the ovens,

31:15.919 --> 31:18.789
along with thousands of desperate people...

31:20.794 --> 31:23.095
all so you can keep the lights on

31:23.120 --> 31:24.581
for your select few.

31:24.606 --> 31:26.456
You don't know!

31:26.481 --> 31:28.606
The virus was spreading!

31:28.631 --> 31:31.631
So you get to decide
who lives and who dies?!

31:31.656 --> 31:34.343
There was panic, Captain,

31:34.638 --> 31:37.158
and I remained calm.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.500
Everybody was fleeing underground,

31:39.525 --> 31:41.410
but I stood firm!

31:41.435 --> 31:44.585
There was no plan and I built this.

31:45.763 --> 31:48.369
I'm the reason these people
have survived this long.

31:48.394 --> 31:51.594
Except when you had the cure in hand,

31:52.249 --> 31:53.779
you wouldn't stop!

31:53.804 --> 31:55.813
You continued killing.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.503
It's over.

32:00.969 --> 32:04.795
Your grand social experiment is history.

32:06.957 --> 32:08.917
I'm offering you the chance.

32:11.645 --> 32:13.155
Surrender with honor.

32:13.180 --> 32:16.050
And who will judge me? You?

32:16.075 --> 32:19.455
Not me. A jury of your peers.

32:21.980 --> 32:23.410
Pick up the radio.

32:24.270 --> 32:26.360
Stand down your troopers.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.490
Shut down Olympia.

32:29.550 --> 32:32.240
Turn away your helo and come peacefully.

32:32.910 --> 32:34.700
It's the only way for you now.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.690
Th-this is Amy...

32:52.815 --> 32:54.631
This is Amy Granderson.

32:54.934 --> 32:56.381
Stand down.

32:57.277 --> 33:00.455
Cease and desist

33:00.480 --> 33:03.863
all operations at Olympia.

33:04.985 --> 33:09.614
Repeat... stand down.

33:10.847 --> 33:12.734
We are surrendering.

33:27.420 --> 33:29.760
I am not a monster.

33:30.380 --> 33:32.870
I am not.

33:33.740 --> 33:37.110
Dr. Hamada assured me

33:37.135 --> 33:38.855
that the cocktail provided

33:38.880 --> 33:41.740
a quick and painless death.

33:42.950 --> 33:45.940
I insisted on it.

34:10.860 --> 34:13.253
<i>Nathan James</i>, arriving.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.143
You saved it?

35:17.570 --> 35:18.573
Not me.

35:19.291 --> 35:20.634
Doc Rios.

35:21.930 --> 35:23.490
And Quincy.

35:29.650 --> 35:32.110
Doc said to get that on ice ASAP.

35:38.306 --> 35:39.524
Right.

36:19.090 --> 36:20.840
Thank you, Holland. I got it from here.

36:20.865 --> 36:21.985
Sir. Yes, sir.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.299
Animals.

36:47.270 --> 36:50.197
You'll stay here until I
can find you a stateroom.

36:55.036 --> 36:57.388
I'll use my at-sea cabin for now.

36:58.433 --> 36:59.963
And then what?

37:01.525 --> 37:04.053
We'll sort things out here in Baltimore.

37:09.721 --> 37:11.871
Then we head back home to Norfolk,

37:11.976 --> 37:14.753
so the crew can look for their families.

37:16.420 --> 37:19.445
And, from there, we'll figure things out.

40:23.155 --> 40:25.046
So, this is home.
