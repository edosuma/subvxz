WEBVTT

00:06.700 --> 00:08.065
- PREVIOUSLY ON PSYCH...
- WE WERE QUITE A TEAM.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.499
BACK IN THOSE DAYS,

00:09.540 --> 00:11.701
HONOR AND RESPECT FOR THE BADGE
MEANT SOMETHING.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.071
YOU TOOK AN OATH, JACK.

00:13.110 --> 00:14.771
WE HAD NO CHOICE.
THE JOB WAS ALL WE HAD.

00:14.810 --> 00:16.368
- YOU HAD A CHOICE.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.503
- THERE ARE STILL PLENTY
OF GOOD COPS ON THE FORCE,

00:18.550 --> 00:20.279
AND THEY PUT THEIR LIVES
ON THE LINE EVERY DAY

00:20.320 --> 00:22.117
FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS.

00:22.150 --> 00:24.243
- IT'S JUST NOT MY GAME
ANYMORE.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.358
- OH, MY GOD.

00:31.390 --> 00:34.791
- OH, YOU KNOW,
50 GRAND WAS A LOT BACK THEN.

00:34.830 --> 00:37.219
- I DIDN'T TELL YOU
HOW MUCH THEY WERE GE'ITIN' PAID.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.577
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO DO THE RIGHT THING, JERRY.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.071
- [sighs]

00:52.120 --> 00:54.111
I'M SORRY, HENRY.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.281
- JERRY, NO!

01:04.830 --> 01:06.252
DAD.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.791
TALK TO ME.
COME ON, TALK TO ME!

01:08.830 --> 01:10.627
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GO GET HIM.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.490
- NO, NO, NO. I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.429
ALL RIGHT, JUST STAY CALM, OKAY?
I'M PRETTY SURE, LIKE,

01:15.470 --> 01:17.438
90% OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS
ARE PSYCHOLOGICAL,

01:17.470 --> 01:19.176
HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS,
THE BODY IS ACTUALLY DESIGNED

01:19.210 --> 01:21.269
FOR THIS SORT OF THING.
- UH, NO, IT'S NOT.

01:21.310 --> 01:22.777
- I'M JUST SAYING,
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR HIM

01:22.810 --> 01:24.744
TO KEEP MOVING, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WALK IT OFF.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.748
THIS ISN'T SERIOUS. THIS ISN'T
LIKE HAVING APPENDICITIS.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.316
- WE'RE TAKING HIM TO SURGERY.
- OKAY, GREAT. THAT'S GREAT.

01:28.350 --> 01:29.817
WHERE DO I STAND? WHERE--
DO I NEED TO WASH UP?

01:29.850 --> 01:31.613
LOOK, MY HANDS
ARE CRAZY CLEAN. LOOK.

01:31.650 --> 01:34.153
I HAD ONE OF THOSE DORITO TACOS
FROM TACO BELL ABOUT AN HOUR--

01:34.190 --> 01:36.158
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME?
I STAY HERE?

01:36.190 --> 01:39.853
OKAY, GOOD CALL.
I'LL MAN--I'LL MAN THE HALLWAY.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.495
YOU GOT TO SAVE HIM,
THAT'S MY DAD!

[heart monitor beeping]

01:49.610 --> 01:53.171
LOOK, I KNOW
I HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN GREAT.

01:54.810 --> 01:58.746
HOLY CRAP, AM I ACTUALLY
GIVING THIS SPEECH?

01:58.780 --> 02:01.510
[exhales deeply]

02:01.550 --> 02:05.680
LET'S JUST SKIP
TO THE END, OKAY?

02:05.720 --> 02:09.520
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO...

02:09.560 --> 02:14.190
NOT ALWAYS HOW YOU DO IT,
BUT, YOU KNOW...

02:14.230 --> 02:17.222
WHAT YOU DO IS GOOD.

02:19.470 --> 02:22.507
AND I JUST--I DON'T THINK NOW
IS A GOOD TIME FOR YOU TO GO,

02:22.540 --> 02:25.134
OKAY?

02:27.940 --> 02:31.205
THAT'S ALL.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.943
AND I LOVE YOUR...

02:35.980 --> 02:38.949
FRENCH TOAST.
[clears throat]

02:38.990 --> 02:40.582
[footsteps approaching]

02:40.620 --> 02:42.952
- I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD.
I AM SO SORRY.

02:42.990 --> 02:44.548
I BROUGHT A SIX-FOOTER.

02:44.590 --> 02:47.889
- WOODY, WHAT ARE YOU--?
WHOA, LOOK. HE--

02:47.930 --> 02:50.819
- OH, AWKWARD.

- HOL--WHA--WHAT?
I-I-I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU

03:06.550 --> 03:08.575
SINCE YOU FOLLOWED MY DAD
TO THAT RESORT.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.212
- MM-HMM.
- WHAT ARE YOU--

03:10.250 --> 03:12.912
UH, DO YOU WORK HERE?
- NOPE. JUST TROLLIN'.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.258
[laughs]

03:16.790 --> 03:18.724
HOW'S THAT SEXY DAD
OF YOURS?

03:18.760 --> 03:19.954
- HE GOT SHOT
IN THE CHEST.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.458
- OH, I FEEL TERRIBLE.
I NEVER CALLED HIM.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.968
- NO, YOU DID. YOU CALLED HIM
MANY TIMES--MANY, MANY TIMES,

03:26.000 --> 03:27.968
AND THEN HE CHANGED
HIS NUMBER...

03:28.000 --> 03:29.729
NOT BECAUSE OF YOU, THOUGH.

03:29.770 --> 03:32.409
I THINK HE WAS GOING THROUGH
SOME OF HIS OWN--

03:32.440 --> 03:34.476
YEAH, HE THOUGHT
YOU WERE GREAT.

03:39.350 --> 03:40.908
- SHAWN, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

03:40.950 --> 03:42.918
- I'M NOT SURE YOU DO.

03:42.950 --> 03:45.783
- YOU'RE IN SHOCK.
YOU'RE DELIRIOUS.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.754
YOU'VE BEEN AWAKE
FOR 36 HOURS.

03:47.790 --> 03:49.428
THE WORST POSSIBLE THING
YOU COULD DO

03:49.460 --> 03:51.951
IS GET INVOLVED
WITH THIS CASE.

03:51.990 --> 03:55.596
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'LL SIT THIS ONE OUT.

03:57.830 --> 03:59.331
- YOU'RE RIGHT--
I AM DELIRIOUS.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.497

04:01.540 --> 04:03.531

TO PICK ME UP.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.333
I'M GONNA TRY
TO GET SOME SLEEP.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.874
[sniffs] CLEARLY
NOTHING I CAN DO HERE.

04:08.910 --> 04:11.799
- ALL RIGHT.
- [grunts]

04:11.850 --> 04:14.648
- SHAWN, JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU NEED.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.648
- I'M A LITTLE HUNGRY.
- ME TOO. HOW ABOUT--

04:16.690 --> 04:18.544
- MOLE TACOS.
- THAT'S SCARY.

04:18.590 --> 04:20.581
- I'M IN. THERE'S ONE THING
I'D LIKE TO DO

04:20.620 --> 04:22.554
BEFORE WE EAT, THOUGH.
- WHAT'S THAT?

04:22.590 --> 04:26.026
- LET'S GO CATCH THE
SON OF A BITCH WHO SHOT MY DAD.

WE'RE JUST
GETTING STARTED.

DEFYING JULIET IS ONE THING,

04:59.900 --> 05:01.595
BUT THIS IS
A HIGH-PROFILE CASE.

05:01.630 --> 05:03.928
A COP WAS SHOT.
- NO, GUS, A COP WAS NOT SHOT.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.665
MY DAD WAS SHOT.
- I KNOW THIS, SHAWN.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.691
- IF YOU WANT OUT,
JUST SAY THE WORD NOW.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.935
- I'M IN, SHAWN.
I'M OBVIOUSLY IN.

05:09.970 --> 05:11.506

- YOU JUST OFFERED ME AN OUT.
- YEAH, AND YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT.

05:35.730 --> 05:38.858
IT'S A NICE HOUSE.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.868
TOO NICE.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.765
I MEAN,
THERE'S A LOT MORE MONEY HERE

05:42.810 --> 05:44.937
THAN THE 50 GRAND HE TOOK
UNDER THE TABLE...

INTO SOME SERIOUS WEALTH HERE.

WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING
ABOUT SOME BAD COP

05:56.850 --> 06:00.388
WHO WAS ON THE TAKE
ONCE 20 YEARS AGO.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.665
IT TAKES MONEY
TO DISAPPEAR, GUS.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.725

HE HASN'T TOUCHED HIS ATM.

06:11.770 --> 06:12.998

MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
NEEDS HELP RIGHT NOW, SHAWN.

- I'M OUT.

06:34.490 --> 06:36.048
- YOU CAN'T TAKE THE SECOND OUT!
- WHY NOT?

06:36.090 --> 06:37.557
- BECAUSE IT'S A COURTESY OUT.
IT'S PERFUNCTORY.

06:37.590 --> 06:38.750
YOU HAVE TO
TURN IT DOWN FIRST.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.052
- HOW MANY RULES
DO THESE OUTS HAVE?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.852

KNOW ALL OF 'EM.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.048
- ALL RIGHT,
WE SIMPLY TACKLE HIM,

07:01.080 --> 07:02.911
BECAUSE HE'S 118 YEARS OLD.

07:02.950 --> 07:05.145
- WHAT? NO. THE ONE THING
WE DO KNOW ABOUT THIS GUY

07:05.190 --> 07:07.909
IS THAT HE HAS DOES HAVE A GUN,
AND HE LIKES TO USE IT.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.053

THAT I BROKE HIS FIGURINE?

IS SHOWING SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.749
- SO WHY DO YOU LOOK UNHAPPY?

09:26.800 --> 09:27.949
- BECAUSE IT SOUNDED
LIKE HE SAID

09:28.000 --> 09:30.321
HIS FIANCEE
WAS HELPING OUT A LOT.

09:37.670 --> 09:40.605
- HEY!

09:49.990 --> 09:52.015
- WHY ARE WE VISITING
AN OFFENSIVE ESTABLISHMENT?

09:52.050 --> 09:54.052
- BECAUSE CARP OWNS IT.
- NO, HE DOES NOT.

09:54.090 --> 09:56.627
WE SAW HIS HOLDINGS IN HIS FILE.
THE COPS CHECKED HIM OUT--

09:56.660 --> 09:58.287
THE SAME COPS WHO TOLD YOU
TO STAY OFF THIS CASE.

09:58.330 --> 10:00.218

ON THIS PLACE, GUS.

10:00.260 --> 10:02.626
IT MEANS HE'S CONNECTED,
AND IF HE'S A SILENT PARTNER,

11:01.190 --> 11:03.681
THIS IS OLD AND RIDICULOUS.
IT WON'T DO.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.220
- I BEG YOUR PARDON?

11:05.260 --> 11:08.821
- I NEED SOMETHING BIGGER, MAN.
MAYBE SOMETHING SEMIAUTOMATIC--

11:08.860 --> 11:11.021
SOMETHING I CAN SHOOT
A CARIBOU WITH.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.391
THAT'S MY DREAM--
NOT FOR SPORT,

11:13.440 --> 11:15.863
JUST FOR THEIR GENERAL
SUPERIOR ATTITUDE.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.004
I WOULDN'T KILL ONE.
NO, SIR.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.474
JUST TEACH THOSE COCKY BASTARDS
A LITTLE HUMILITY

11:20.510 --> 11:21.909
BY GRAZING IT IN ITS HORN.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.909
GIVE ME THAT.
I WANT TO TALK TO THE OWNER.

11:24.950 --> 11:27.976
- JACK DON'T COME OUT HERE
UNLESS THERE'S A PROBLEM.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.715
- REALLY?

11:29.750 --> 11:32.116
- PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.311
- SCREW YOU, ANGRY BIRDS!

11:46.940 --> 11:48.896
WOLVERINE!

11:50.770 --> 11:53.830
- [grunts]
- AAH!

11:53.880 --> 11:55.177
- DO NOT GO BONELESS, SHAWN.

11:55.210 --> 11:56.973
- I DEMAND
TO SPEAK WITH JACK!

11:57.010 --> 11:59.911
- YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A HELL OF A WAIT.

11:59.950 --> 12:01.918
AIN'T NO ONE GONNA SEE ATWATER
FOR A WHILE.

12:01.950 --> 12:04.783
- WHOA.
HOLD UP, HOLD UP.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.048
JACK ATWATER?

12:06.090 --> 12:08.251
- YOU KNOW HIM?

12:08.290 --> 12:10.326
- JACK!
- WHO ARE WE CHASING?

12:10.360 --> 12:13.955
- JACK ATWATER--DETECT IVE
WHO USED TO WORK WITH MY DAD.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.221
YEAH, I PUT HIM IN JAIL.
LAST WEEK.

12:18.270 --> 12:19.999
- AND WHY IS HE
GONNA TALK TO US?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.065
- WHY DO YOU THINK, GUS?
ANYTHING HE SAYS TO HELP OUT

12:22.100 --> 12:23.931
MEANS LESS TIME FOR HIM
ON THE INSIDE.

12:23.970 --> 12:25.437
- THIS GUY TRIED TO KILL YOU
LAST WEEK.

12:25.470 --> 12:27.404
- PRETENDED TO TRY AND KILL ME.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.806
TRUST ME--WE NEED HIM.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.477
ALL RIGHT, JACK,
WE'RE ALL EARS.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.068
- SHAWN, YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME,
I WAS JUST TRYING

12:33.120 --> 12:34.769
TO SCARE YOU OFF.

12:34.820 --> 12:35.946
ALL RIGHT, I DID A BAD THING.

12:35.980 --> 12:38.016
I TRIED TO HIDE
THAT BLUE DERBY BUSINESS,

12:38.050 --> 12:41.087
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT CARP
WOULD SHOOT HENRY. I DIDN'T.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.951
I TOLD THE D.A.
I'LL TELL EVERYTHING,

12:42.990 --> 12:44.480
EVEN BEFORE YOU CAME HERE.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.556
IF IT MAKES ME LOOK BETTER
WITH THE JUDGE, SO BE IT.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.488
- I JUST NEED TO KNOW
WHERE CARP IS.

12:49.530 --> 12:50.963
- HE'S GOT A LOT
OF FRIENDS, SHAWN.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.934
HE DON'T NEED TO GO FAR.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.130
[gunshot]

12:55.940 --> 12:58.067
- PRISONER IS DOWN.
I REPEAT--ATWATER'S DOWN.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.269
- I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LIKE THIS.

13:05.310 --> 13:07.175
- HONESTLY, JULES,
WHAT HAVE I DONE...

13:07.220 --> 13:08.539
BESIDES COME UP
WITH SOME ANSWERS FOR THIS CASE,

13:08.580 --> 13:10.138
AND NOT CHARGE YOU
FOR THEM?

13:10.190 --> 13:12.909
- YOU ARE ACTING IMPULSIVELY
IN A VERY DANGEROUS WAY.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.882
YOU DON'T SEE
THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS ERRATIC?

13:14.920 --> 13:17.127
AND NOW OUR BEST WITNESS
IS DEAD.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.378
- LOOK, WHOEVER THE SHOOTER IS,
THEY WERE GONNA KILL JACK

13:19.430 --> 13:20.988
WHETHER WE WERE THERE OR NOT,

13:21.030 --> 13:23.863
AND, TECHNICALLY,
I HAD AN OUT.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.868
- THE SHOOTER'S POSITION
WAS OPTIMAL.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.868
IT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE WHO KNEW
THE AREA, KNEW THE PICKUP TIME.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.128
I'M GUESSING LOCAL.

13:29.170 --> 13:31.001
TOOK THAT SHOT
AT 150 YARDS IN A CROSSWIND.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.234
THERE'S ONLY
A FEW PEOPLE IN TOWN

13:32.270 --> 13:33.999
WHO CAN MAKE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

13:34.040 --> 13:36.076
AND, WELL,
I'M STANDING HERE.

13:36.110 --> 13:37.907
- NICELY DONE, ALL.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.542
I MEAN, MR. GUSTER,

13:39.580 --> 13:42.515
YOU SUBSEQUENTLY COMPLIMENTED
AND THEN SOLD OUT YOUR FRIEND,

13:42.550 --> 13:45.041
AND, CARLTON, YOU JUST
COMPLIMENTED YOURSELF

13:45.090 --> 13:46.387
ON YOUR SHOOTING ABILITIES,

13:46.420 --> 13:49.856
AND, O'HARA, YOU JUST
IMPLICATED YOURSELF

13:49.890 --> 13:51.949
IN HAVING KNOWLEDGE
OF SPENCER'S WRONGDOINGS.

13:51.990 --> 13:54.527
- IN MY DEFENSE, CHIEF,
I AM THAT GOOD,

13:54.560 --> 13:56.152
AND THERE'S
AN ANATOMICALLY CORRECT TROPHY

13:56.200 --> 13:58.065
OVER MY TOILET
THAT CONFIRMS THAT FACT.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.938
- CLEAR THE ROOM, NOW.

14:01.970 --> 14:04.109
- YES, MA'AM.

14:05.010 --> 14:08.639
- BUT NOT YOU, SHAWN.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.545
THERE IS NOTHING
MORE DANGEROUS

14:10.580 --> 14:12.912
THAN HAVING AN INVESTIGATOR
WHO IS EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.

14:12.950 --> 14:14.315
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

14:14.350 --> 14:16.989
HOW ABOUT A RACCOON
WITH A DISCARDED MALARIA SAMPLE?

14:17.020 --> 14:19.545
- AND I'D BE CRAZY TO TELL YOU
TO GO AFTER JERRY CARP.

14:19.590 --> 14:23.048
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT, CHIEF.
- NO, YOU DON'T.

14:23.090 --> 14:26.582
SEE, I WOULD BE
ABSOLUTELY CRAZY TO TELL YOU,

14:26.630 --> 14:28.450
THE CLOSEST THING THAT WE HAVE
TO A SURE THING,

14:28.500 --> 14:31.992
TO GO OUT THERE AND FIND
THIS DIRTY SON OF A BITCH.

14:32.030 --> 14:34.066
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, CHIEF?

14:34.100 --> 14:38.036
- YOU ARE NOT
TO GO AFTER CARP...

14:39.240 --> 14:42.971
AND WE NEVER HAD
THIS CONVERSATION.

14:43.010 --> 14:44.648
- WE DID.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.187
WE DIDN'T.

14:58.990 --> 15:00.992
- SHAWN, WHEN WE WERE THROWN
OUT OF HERE,

15:01.030 --> 15:03.191
WHAT PART OF "BANNED FOR LIFE"
DID YOU MISINTERPRET?

15:03.230 --> 15:05.994
- ALL OF IT. I ACCEPT THE FACT
THAT SHAWN SPENCER

15:06.030 --> 15:08.590
HAS BEEN BANNED FOR LIFE,
HOWEVER...

15:08.640 --> 15:12.531
SOUPCAN SAM
HAS NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS.

15:12.570 --> 15:14.504
- NO, NO, NO, SHAWN.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.508
NOT ONLY DO THESE PEOPLE
HAVE GUNS,

15:16.540 --> 15:18.349
THEY HAND THEM OUT
TO OTHER PEOPLE

15:18.380 --> 15:20.519
WHO HATE YOU FOR RUINING THEIR
"RULES AND REGULATIONS" SIGN.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.142
YOU'RE NOT GOING IN THERE
WITH YOUR WORST DISGUISE.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.045
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THIS IS MY BEST DISGUISE,

15:24.090 --> 15:26.046
SECOND ONLY TO JAUNDICE JIMMY,
WHICH I WOULD HAVE GONE WITH

15:26.090 --> 15:27.978
IF YOU HADN'T EATEN
ALL THE YELLOW MUSTARD.

15:28.020 --> 15:29.715
DID YOU MAKE YOLNIJSELF CORN DOGS?

15:29.760 --> 15:32.627
- I REST MY CASE.

15:32.660 --> 15:35.322
[sighs]
I'M JUST GONNA GO IN THERE,

15:35.360 --> 15:37.225
ACT LIKE
I NEED TO USE THE CAN,

15:37.270 --> 15:39.067
MAYBE GIVE MYSELF
A LITTLE BUM BATH--

15:39.100 --> 15:40.965
YOU KNOW, "SPLASH, SPLASH,
CHEEK, CHEEK," THEN CALL IT.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.661
- SHAWN--
- LOOK, BOTTOM LINE...

15:42.700 --> 15:45.009
I NEED TO SEE
THAT HALL-OF-FAME BOARD.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.598
- TOOK THE SHOT
AT 150 YARDS IN A CROSSWIND.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.176
THERE'S ONLY A FEW PEOPLE
IN TOWN WHO CAN MAKE THAT SHOT.

15:48.210 --> 15:52.943
- A GUN RANGE?
- THAT'S RIGHT, BUT FOR KIDS.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.516
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
MY HEINIE?

15:57.550 --> 16:01.384
- OH, MY GOSH. YOU LOOK LIKE
THE BIRD LADY FROM MARY POPPINS.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.058
I CAN'T LET YOU
GO IN THERE ALONE.

16:03.090 --> 16:05.456
- GUS, I HAVE ONE BEARD--ONE.

16:05.490 --> 16:08.425
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO?

16:11.170 --> 16:14.230
- UH, $10, 4 CHAIRS...

16:14.270 --> 16:17.398
CLEAN WHISTLE...
HELP MYSELF.

16:17.440 --> 16:25.074
- [coughing]
- [laughing]

16:26.810 --> 16:28.414
- WHAT THE HELL VOICE IS THAT?

16:28.450 --> 16:30.782
- THAT'S MY DELIVERY MAN,
SATCHEL--SATCHEL GIZMO.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.742
HE'S LIKEABLE, SO EVERYONE
LET'S HIM INTO PLACES.

16:32.790 --> 16:35.054
- HE'S INDECIPHERABLE
AND CONSTIPATED.

16:35.090 --> 16:36.682
- THAT'S A PART OF HIS CHARM.
- HIS CHARM IS THAT

16:36.720 --> 16:38.779
HE'S ALL STOPPED UP?
- HE'S BEEN MARRIED NINE TIMES.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.196
- HOW MUCH BACKSTORY DID YOU
COME UP WITH FOR THIS GUY?

16:41.230 --> 16:43.562
OH, RIGHT.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.694
[door opens, closes]

16:46.730 --> 16:50.507
[laughs]

16:52.110 --> 16:55.432
LASSIE WASN'T KIDDING.
HE IS THAT GOOD.

16:58.110 --> 17:01.147
OUR FRIEND JERRY IS KNEE-DEEP
INTO SOMETHING BIGGER, GUS.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.772
WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING
ABOUT SOME BAD COP

17:02.820 --> 17:05.141
WHO WAS ON THE TAKE ONCE
20 YEARS AGO.

17:05.190 --> 17:09.650
[cell phone ringing]

17:09.690 --> 17:12.488
- WHAT ARE YOU BOYS DOIN'
BACK HERE?

17:17.730 --> 17:19.129
- HEY, POP.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.694
- HE'S NOT TALKING YET.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.061
THAT'S ONE OF THE LAST THINGS
TO COME BACK,

17:23.110 --> 17:24.338
SO HE'S WRITING
TO COMMUNICATE.

17:24.370 --> 17:25.701
HE'S NOT FAR
FROM OUT OF THE WOODS,

17:25.740 --> 17:27.105
BUT HE'S COMING ALONG
REALLY WELL,

17:27.140 --> 17:29.438
THANKS TO HIS REMARKABLE
LITTLE LADY HERE.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.175
- [laughs]

17:31.210 --> 17:33.519
I'VE JUST BEEN
KEEPING ON TALKING,

17:33.550 --> 17:36.348
JUST KEEPIN' HIM AWAY
FROM THAT WHITE LIGHT.

17:36.380 --> 17:38.689
[giggIeSI
JUST TALK AND TALK.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.211
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST LIKE THIS.
IT KEEPS HIM AWAKE.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.228
- I WILL NOT.
STOP IT.

17:43.260 --> 17:46.127
GUS, SERIOUSLY?
- HE'S NOT GONNA EAT IT, SHAWN.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.856
- LISTEN, POP,
I KNOW WHO JACK'S SHOOTER IS.

17:48.900 --> 17:52.825
HE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF CARP'S
NAMED JAMES EARL VEST.

17:52.870 --> 17:55.839
YEAH?
DO YOU KNOW WHO?

17:57.710 --> 18:00.873
HE'S A COP.
STILL ON THE FORCE?

18:00.910 --> 18:01.877
NO.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.208
[paper rustling]

18:04.250 --> 18:06.104
HE'S A PRIVATE SECURITY GUY.

18:06.150 --> 18:09.278
ALL RIGHT, WE, UH--ANY IDEA
WHO HE'S WORKING FOR?

18:13.290 --> 18:16.157
"FEED EVERYONE."
- YOU GOT IT.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.384
- HE DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT, GUS.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.682
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE MEANT, SHAWN.

18:19.730 --> 18:22.494
- YOU HANG IN THERE.
WE'RE ON THIS.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.869
- OH...

18:24.900 --> 18:28.461
LOOK AT YOU,
ALL SPRINGY AND NEW.

18:28.500 --> 18:32.266
I HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR
THE SPONGE BATH OF A LIFETIME.

18:32.310 --> 18:35.108
[purrs, giggles]

18:39.180 --> 18:40.841
- SPREAD THE WORD.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.438
LOVELY.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.517
- VEST LEFT THE FORCE,
NOT BY CHOICE, I MIGHT ADD.

18:45.550 --> 18:47.552
NOW HE HEADS UP SECURITY
FOR JULIAN DRAKE,

18:47.590 --> 18:50.184
WHOSE BOOK TITLE YOU USED
AS JUSTIFICATION TO STEAL FOOD

18:50.230 --> 18:51.879
FROM A MAN ON LIFE SUPPORT.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.522
- WHY WOULD YOU GIVE CAKE
TO A MAN WHO HAS FEEDING TUBES?

18:53.560 --> 18:54.891
- [whispering]
THERE HE IS.

18:54.930 --> 18:56.921
THAT'S HIM.
THAT'S VEST, THE BALD GUY.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.564
DOLLARS FOR DOUGHNUTS,
THAT'S THE SNIPER

18:58.600 --> 19:00.192
THAT KILLED JACK ATWATER.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.662
- WHAT'S THE PLAN?

19:01.700 --> 19:03.463
- PUSH OUR WAY TO THE FRONT,
DISARM HIM,

19:03.510 --> 19:06.536
FORCE HIM TO TURN OVER CARP,
POSSIBLY INVOLVE PEPPER SPRAY.

19:06.570 --> 19:07.935
- CAN WE DO SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.174
[both clicking tongue]

19:09.210 --> 19:11.178
- FINE.

19:12.550 --> 19:15.212
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
- THANKS.

19:16.550 --> 19:18.643
- YOU WANT THIS SIGNED?
- YES, PLEASE.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.817
- THIS ISN'T MY BOOK.
- OH, REALLY? MY MISTAKE.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.283
- THIS IS EVERYONE POOPS.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.752
- EXCEPT MY GIRLFRIEND.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.485
WOULD YOU MAKE IT OUT
TO "SHAWN," ANWVAY?

19:26.530 --> 19:28.498
"SHAWN," THE GUY WHO'S GONNA
BRING DOWN JERRY CARP.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.964
- JERRY--
- SIR, CAN WE HAVE A WORD?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.820
- YEAH, IN A MINUTE.
COULD YOU ALSO ADD

19:32.870 --> 19:34.963
THAT I KNOW WHO KILLED
JACK ATWATER AS WELL?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.797
I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE LONG INSCRIPTION,

19:36.840 --> 19:39.365
BUT TRUST ME, IT'S GONNA BE
WAY MORE POWERFUL THIS WAY.

19:39.410 --> 19:41.469
- I'M CONFUSED.
- IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU, SIR.

19:41.510 --> 19:43.501
AND LET ME JUST SAY,
I REALLY LIKE YOUR INITIATIVE

19:43.550 --> 19:44.847
TO NOURISH
THE VICTIMS OF WAR.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.939
- THANK YOU.
- ATWATER WITH AN "A"...

19:46.980 --> 19:49.972
K-I-L-L-E-D ATWATER.
- THAT'S ABOUT ENOUGH.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.510
- WHY?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

19:51.550 --> 19:53.211
YOU GONNA SHOOT ME
WITH YOUR LONG-RANGE RIFLE?

19:53.260 --> 19:54.784
ISN'T THAT YOUR MOVE?

19:54.820 --> 19:56.811
OR YOU GONNA DO IT POINT-BLANK
STYLE LIKE YOUR BUDDY JERRY?

19:56.860 --> 19:58.521
- SIR, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS OUTSIDE.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.357
- WE'RE OUTMANNED HERE, SHAWN

20:00.400 --> 20:02.493
- PLEASE, THESE GUYS ARE LIKE
BUCKINGHAM PALACE GUARDS, GUS.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.919
THEY CAN'T EVEN LAY
A FINGER ON US.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.837
AAAH!

20:07.870 --> 20:10.532
- AAAH!

20:15.540 --> 20:16.837
- SEE YOU SOON.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.802
- GET IN LINE.

20:26.590 --> 20:29.684
- SHAWN,
YOU CAN'T DUCK ME FOREVER.

20:29.720 --> 20:32.518
THIS IS CRAZY. YOU ARE CRAZY.
YOU NEED TO STOP.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.653
WE ARE IN
WAY OVER OUR HEADS.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.521
WE HAVE REDEFINED THE WORDS
"OVER OUR HEADS."

20:37.570 --> 20:40.459
- "OVER OUR HEADS,"
GREAT TITLE FOR A MOVIE

20:40.500 --> 20:42.639
ABOUT TWO SHORT GUYS
WHO PRETEND TO BE ONE TALL GUY

20:42.670 --> 20:44.968
IN ORDER TO GET
A BASKETBALL SCHOLARSHIP.

20:45.010 --> 20:47.831
GUS, WOULD YOU RELAX?
OKAY?

20:47.880 --> 20:49.939
WE JUST NEEDED TO STIR UP
THE HORNET'S NEST A BIT.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.538
CARP IS GONNA MAKE A MOVE,

20:51.580 --> 20:55.346
AND I MADE
JERK CHICKEN APOLOGY NACHOS.

20:58.890 --> 21:01.779
- I'M LISTENING,
BUT ONLY UNTIL I FINISH EATING.

21:01.820 --> 21:04.288
- UH, UH, WAIT A BEAT.
THEY'RE PIPING HOT.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.753
LOOK, WE NEED
TO FLUSH HIM OUT, RIGHT?

21:06.790 --> 21:10.362
AND WHAT DO WE KNOW?
WELL, FOR ONE, WE KNOW--

21:10.400 --> 21:12.618
[click]

21:12.670 --> 21:16.390
- UH, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

21:16.440 --> 21:17.907
- YES, I DID.

21:17.940 --> 21:22.536
- IS THAT THE SOUND OF--
- CARP'S LAND MINE?

21:22.580 --> 21:24.047
YES, IT IS, GUS.

21:37.560 --> 21:41.098
- SHAWN IS GOING TO BE
JUST FINE--I'M SURE OF IT.

21:41.130 --> 21:44.725
- THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE TWO
BODY BAGS TUCKED UNDER YOUR ARM?

21:44.770 --> 21:48.399
- NO REASON, DEAR.
NO REASON AT ALL.

21:48.440 --> 21:52.399
- [whispering]
WHAT IF I GRAB THEM?

21:52.440 --> 21:54.431
- THEN WE'LL DIE.

21:54.480 --> 21:58.507
- UH, WE'RE GONNA DIE
ANYWAY, SHAWN.

21:59.980 --> 22:01.971
- [over megaphone]
OKAY, LISTEN CAREFULLY.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.989
IN A FEW MOMENTS, MY MEN WILL BE
COMING IN TO FREEZE THE DEVICE.

22:05.020 --> 22:06.681
ONCE THAT'S BEEN ACCOMPLISHED,

22:06.720 --> 22:09.484
OUR MOBILE DISPOSAL UNIT
WILL ENTER TO REMOVE IT.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.852
IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT YOU DO NOT MOVE.

22:11.890 --> 22:13.949
DO YOU SEE
THE REMOVAL UNIT?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.956
- NO...

22:16.000 --> 22:19.492
BUT WE DO SEE JOHNNY 5
FROM THE SHORT CIRCUIT MOVIES.

22:19.530 --> 22:22.090
- JUST GUIDE US TO THE GENERAL
VICINITY, AND WE'LL TAKE OVER.

22:22.140 --> 22:24.734
- OKAY, FINE.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.609
GO STRAIGHT.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.902
JUST KEEP GOING STRAIGHT.

22:29.940 --> 22:32.477
SLOW DOWN. NOW TURN.

22:32.510 --> 22:34.546
NO, NO, NO.
THE OTHER WAY.

22:34.580 --> 22:37.708
STOP, CLAMP, AND SPIN.

22:37.750 --> 22:41.550
- I'M NOT SURE
THIS IS THE CORRECT POSITION.

22:41.590 --> 22:44.980
- CLAMP AND SPIN,
DAMN IT!

22:47.860 --> 22:51.728
- DEVICE DISARMED,
PERFORMING EXTRACTION.

22:57.970 --> 23:00.871
WE HAVE CLEARED THE BUILDING,
PREPPING FOR DISPOSAL.

23:06.210 --> 23:10.044
- DEFUSED AND SECURE--
ALL CLEAR.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.446
[both breathing heavily]

23:12.490 --> 23:15.414
- OH. OH!
- JELLY LEGS!

23:15.460 --> 23:16.916
[both whimpering]

23:20.090 --> 23:23.127
[both grunting]

23:32.240 --> 23:34.003
- I WONDER
IF THEIR BUNS ARE GLAZED.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.837
- JULES,
WHY ARE YOU SO WORRIED?

23:35.880 --> 23:38.007
- SHAWN, YOU'RE LUCKY THEY
WERE ABLE TO DEFUSE THAT THING.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.006
NOW THAT CARP HAS GONE
AFTER YOU AND YOUR DAD,

23:40.050 --> 23:43.042
I'M WORRIED YOU'RE GONNA GO
ALL MEL GIBSON FROM THAT MOVIE.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.015
- LOOK, THE SIMILARITIES
BETWEEN ME AND MEL'S CHARACTER

23:46.050 --> 23:48.211
END WITH HIS WASHBOARD ABS
AND THE FACT

23:48.260 --> 23:50.751
THAT I HAVE A BLACK PARTNER
WHO MUMBLES A LOT.

23:50.790 --> 23:53.793
I AM OFF THIS CASE, OKAY?
RELAX.

23:53.830 --> 23:54.649
IN FACT, I'M ABOUT TO HAVE

23:54.700 --> 23:56.725
A NICE BREAKFAST
WITH GUS RIGHT NOW.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.625
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
BIG, FAT KISSES.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.535
- BIG, FAT KISSES.

24:00.570 --> 24:02.492
- SHAWN,
YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T JETHRO'S,

24:02.540 --> 24:04.599
HOME OF THE DEEP-FRIED
DOUGHNUT BURGER.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.200
IN FACT, THIS IS THE WAREHOUSE
FOR FEED EVERYONE.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.107
- UH, I'M SORRY, GUS.
THIS IS MY MISTAKE.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.904
BUT, UH,
SINCE WE'RE HERE...

24:12.950 --> 24:14.474
[grunts]

24:14.520 --> 24:15.976
MIGHT AS WELL
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

24:16.020 --> 24:17.442
- WHAT?

24:20.560 --> 24:23.211
MM-MM.
NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.922
I WANT TO USE MY OUT NOW.

24:33.900 --> 24:35.959
- YOU'D BE WISE
TO HOLD ON TO IT, GUS.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.763
REMEMBER WHEN THE JUDGES
ON AMERICAN IDO USED THE SAVE

24:37.810 --> 24:40.233
ON THAT BLIND PIANIST
WHO LOOKED LIKE BRUCE HORNSBY?

24:40.270 --> 24:42.079
- SCOTT MACINTYRE
WASN'T SAVED.

24:42.110 --> 24:43.509
- WELL,
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.040
THE MAN SANG
LIKE A SIGHTLESS ANGEL.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.672
- SHAWN, I'M PRETTY SURE
THERE ARE EXTRA LAWS

24:46.710 --> 24:48.041
AGAINST BREAKING INTO A CHARITY.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.048
- NOT WHEN SAID CHARITY
IS THE HEADQUARTERS FOR THE GUY

24:50.080 --> 24:51.786
WHO JUST TRIED TO KILL YOU.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.685
- I THOUGHT CARP WAS THE GUY
GOING AFTER US.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.915
- HE IS.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.279
VEST MUST BE HIS TRIGGERMAN.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.026
HE HAD HIM POP JACK
BEFORE HE COULD SQUEAL,

24:59.060 --> 25:00.288
AND THEN TRIED
TO DO THE SAME THING TO US.

25:00.330 --> 25:02.127
HERE, GIVE ME
MY BREAK-IN BRICK.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.299
- I'M NOT LIFTING A FINGER
UNTIL I GET SOME NOURISHMENT.

25:04.330 --> 25:06.821
THE ONLY THING I'VE HAD
SINCE THOSE NACHOS LAST NIGHT

25:06.870 --> 25:09.191
IS A BOX OF POP-TARTS
AND A MOONS OVER MY HAMMY.

25:09.240 --> 25:13.734
- FINE. HERE, HAVE SOME, UH--
HAVE SOME TUNA.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.873
- THAT WOULD BE LIKE TAKING FOOD
OUT OF POOR PEOPLE'S MOUTHS,

25:15.910 --> 25:17.901
SHAWN.
- THEY ALSO HAVE PEACHES.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.874
- OH, I'LL EAT ME
SOME PEACHES.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.070
COME ON.

25:29.190 --> 25:31.784
- THERE'S ANOTHER CRATE
IN HERE.

25:32.890 --> 25:34.096
- MMM, MMM, MMM.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.893
BREAK ENOUGH GLASS TODAY?

25:45.070 --> 25:46.901
- [grunts]

25:46.940 --> 25:49.909
THAT DIRTY, FILTHY
SON OF A BITCH.

25:49.940 --> 25:52.204
- I REALLY LIKE YOUR INITIATIVE
TO NOURISH THE VICTIMS OF WAR.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.877
- THANK YOU.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.172
- DRAKE'S NOT SUPPLYING FOOD
TO WAR-TORN REGIONS.

25:56.220 --> 25:58.040
HE'S SUPPLYING WEAPONS.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.842
NO WONDER
THE GUY IS SO RICH.

25:59.890 --> 26:02.814
HE TAKES PEOPLE'S DONATIONS,
USES 'EM TO BUY GUNS,

26:02.860 --> 26:05.624
SELLS 'EM OFF TO WARLORDS.
- WARLORDS?

26:05.660 --> 26:07.082
- USING THE ACCESS
HE HAS FROM HIS CHARITY.

26:07.130 --> 26:10.622
- I'M SICK TO MY STOMACH.
- YEAH, I KNOW, GUS.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.069
THIS IS ABOUT AS SLEAZY
AS IT GETS.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.658
- NO, I'M REALLY SICK
TO MY STOMACH.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.031
I THINK THESE PEACHES
ARE ROTTEN.

26:15.070 --> 26:17.129
- THEN STOP EATING THEM.

26:17.170 --> 26:20.207
I BET YOU ANYTHING DRAKE'S
THE ONE WHO'S PROTECTING CARP.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.129
WHY? BECAUSE CARP
PROVIDES HIM WITH HIS WEAPONS.

26:23.180 --> 26:25.944
HOW? THROUGH
HE AND JACK'S BUSINESS.

26:25.980 --> 26:29.848
THEY JUST SWAPPED 'EM OUT,
MAKE 'EM UNTRACEABLE.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.759
- CAN I HELP YOU, BOYS?
- WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

26:33.790 --> 26:36.315
WE FIND DRAKE,
WE FIND CARP.

26:39.730 --> 26:41.891
[gun cocks]
- YOU MADE A MAJOR MISTAKE.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.323
WELL, SO HAVE YOU, MAN.

26:46.370 --> 26:49.168
WEARING LOAFERS WITH WHITE SOCKS
IS A SERIOUS NO-NO.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.633
- FREEZE!

26:50.670 --> 26:52.308
- NO, YOU FREEZE.

26:52.340 --> 26:53.932
- WELL, LOOK AT THIS.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.631
IT SEEMS WE HAVE OURSELVES
A LITTLE MEXICAN STANDOFF.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.944
- IT WOULD ONLY BE
A MEXICAN STANDOFF, SHAWN,

26:58.980 --> 27:01.119
IF YOU WERE
POINTING A GUN AT LASSIE.

27:01.150 --> 27:02.879
- HOW DOES THAT MAKE IT MEXICAN?
- I DON'T KNOW.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.285
- WATCH IT, MACK.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.288
I WILL THROW
THIS CUP OF ROTTEN PEACHES

27:06.320 --> 27:08.709
DIRECTLY AT YOUR FACE
AS HARD AS I CAN.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.352
- I'M FBI.

27:10.390 --> 27:12.221
- BULL.

27:12.260 --> 27:15.297
- HAVE A LOOK FOR YOURSELF.
CHECK MY FRONT POCKET.

27:15.330 --> 27:16.888
- GUSTER, CHECK IT.
- WHAT?

27:16.930 --> 27:18.864
- CHECK IT!

27:18.900 --> 27:21.198
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, MAN.
I GOT YOU.

27:24.070 --> 27:26.038
both: THE BLAZER!

27:26.070 --> 27:27.833
- WHY WOULD YOU GO LOW?

27:27.880 --> 27:30.769
- HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO--
- JUST CHECK IT!

27:36.050 --> 27:40.282
- PUT YOUR GUN DOWN.

27:40.320 --> 27:43.209
- WHY WOULD YOU GO LOW?

27:43.260 --> 27:46.354
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW LONG
I'VE BEEN WORKING UNDERCOVER

27:46.390 --> 27:48.028
FOR JULIAN DRAKE?
- AND I ASSURE YOU,

27:48.060 --> 27:49.823
HAD THEY KNOWN
THAT YOU WERE ON THE JOB,

27:49.860 --> 27:51.919
THEY WOULD HMME BACKED OFF.

27:51.970 --> 27:54.359
- IT'S TAKEN US SIX MONTHS TO
GET A HANDLE ON HIS OPERATIONS.

27:59.340 --> 28:00.807
- SERIOUSLY?

28:00.840 --> 28:01.932
IT TOOK ME
ALL OF THREE HOURS.

28:01.980 --> 28:03.971
- PLEASE,
LIKE YOU KNOW ANYTHING.

28:04.010 --> 28:05.841
- I KNOW JULIAN DRAKE
RUNS A PHONY CHARITY

28:05.880 --> 28:07.074
AS A FRONT
FOR HIS ARMS BUSINESS--

28:07.110 --> 28:10.011
ARMS THAT ARE BEING SUPPLIED
BY A JERRY CARP.

28:10.050 --> 28:12.314
CARP IS CURRENTLY
BEING PROTECTED BY DRAKE

28:12.350 --> 28:14.079
SOMEWHERE IN SANTA BARBARA
RIGHT NOW.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.781
HOW AM I DOIN' SO FAR?

28:15.820 --> 28:17.481
- JERRY CARP'S
A LOW-LEVEL PLAYER.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.181
WE DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT HIM.
- WELL, I DON'T GIVE A DAMN

28:19.230 --> 28:23.724
ABOUT YOUR SOFT, PEACHY,
ANTHONY MICHAEL HALL-ISH FACE!

28:23.770 --> 28:26.295
- TAKE A BREATH.
- WHAT IS THE POINT OF HIS FACE?

28:34.010 --> 28:38.071
CHIEF, PLEASE TELL ME WE'RE
NOT GONNA LISTEN TO THAT THING.

28:38.110 --> 28:39.270
- WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

28:39.310 --> 28:42.370
THE FBI
NOW HAS JURISDICTION HERE.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.081
OKAY, SO NO ONE--
I REPEAT--

28:44.120 --> 28:46.315
NO ONE ASSOCIATED
WITH THIS DEPARTMENT

28:46.350 --> 28:49.319
CAN NOW GO AFTER CARP OR DRAKE.
IS THAT CLEAR?

28:53.130 --> 28:54.358
- [scoffs]

29:11.110 --> 29:12.475
- YOU'RE GOING AFTER HIM,
AREN'T YOU?

29:12.510 --> 29:14.171
- COME ON, JULES,
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

29:14.220 --> 29:17.075
- HONESTY WOULD BE A GOOD START.
I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.348
- OH, YEAH? THEN HELP ME
FIND THIS GUY.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.982
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT.

29:20.020 --> 29:22.989
LOOK, I'M WORRIED
ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU.

29:23.020 --> 29:24.453
- LOOK, IF THEY FIRE ME,
THEY FIRE ME.

29:24.490 --> 29:26.151
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT, SHAWN.

29:26.190 --> 29:29.853
THESE ARE
VERY DANGEROUS PEOPLE.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.868
- LOOK, I APPRECIATE
THE CONCERN, I DO,

29:31.900 --> 29:34.869
BUT I GOT TO GO.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.891
- [sighs]

29:50.550 --> 29:52.814
- ARE YOU SURE THAT CHIEF VICK
SAID THIS WAS OKAY?

29:52.850 --> 29:56.013
- GUS, SHE SIMPLY
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY CLEARER.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.551
THERE'S VEST.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.023
THERE'S JULIAN.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.129
NOW WE'RE JUST MISSING CARP.

30:02.160 --> 30:04.025
WHERE ARE YOU,
YOU SON OF A BITCH?

30:04.070 --> 30:06.322
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE
SOMEWHERE.

30:06.370 --> 30:07.997
BINGO.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.167
WE GOT HIM.
WE GOT HIM!

30:10.200 --> 30:12.009
I'M GUESSING NOW IS
ABOUT THE TIME YOU'D LIKE TO--

30:12.040 --> 30:13.132
- USE MY OUT?
MOST DEFINITELY.

30:13.170 --> 30:14.569
- I WAS GONNA SAY,
"HAVE SOME BACON."

30:14.610 --> 30:16.237
THERE ARE TWO STRIPS
OF VERY CRISP BACON

30:16.280 --> 30:18.100
THAT I BROUGHT
FOR YOU IN MY BAG.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.845
- MAN, I ATE THOSE
A HALF HOUR AGO.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.177
THEY WERE
SURPRISINGLY CRISP,

30:21.220 --> 30:23.017
BUT WHAT EXACTLY
IS THE PLAN HERE?

30:23.050 --> 30:25.018
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE PLAN IS, MAN?

30:25.050 --> 30:26.483
WE'RE GONNA BARGE IN THERE.
WE'RE GONNA BUST CARP'S ASS.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.885
- AND WHAT ABOUT
THE THREE DUDES ON THE DECK

30:27.920 --> 30:29.080
PLAYING CARDS
WITH HOWITZERS?

30:29.120 --> 30:30.610
- WOULD YOU STOP
OVERTHINKING THIS?

30:30.660 --> 30:32.127
- IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK
UNLESS YOU HAVE A SURE-FIRE WAY

30:32.160 --> 30:33.479
TO TAKE OUT
THREE ARMED DUDES, SHAWN.

30:33.530 --> 30:35.350
- [clicks tongue]

30:35.400 --> 30:38.858
[rock music playing]

30:38.900 --> 30:45.339
*

30:56.950 --> 30:58.941
I TIED IT
TO THE SUPPORT BEAM.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.083
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A MADMAN.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.553
- MORE LIKE A LETHAL WEAPON.
- WHAT?

31:02.590 --> 31:04.956
- I'M ABOUT TO TAKE OUT
THIS BALCONY.

31:04.990 --> 31:07.458
_ - WHAT?_
[tires squealing]

31:07.490 --> 31:09.094
- SHAWN, THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK!

31:09.130 --> 31:13.066
AAAH!

31:13.100 --> 31:15.091
[loud crash]

31:20.010 --> 31:23.571
- YOU HIT A SPEED BUMP, HUH?
- YEAH.

31:23.610 --> 31:26.078
DAMN GERMAN ENGINEERING.

31:26.110 --> 31:27.543
- CAR'S JAPANESE.
- THAT'S CORRECT.

31:27.580 --> 31:30.617
BUT, UH, THE SPEED BUMP
WAS MADE IN HAMBURG.

31:30.650 --> 31:36.213
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE
MINI BERLIN WALL--OLD VERSION.

31:36.260 --> 31:40.185
- THIS IS GONNA TAKE A WHILE.
- UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

31:49.300 --> 31:51.029
SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

31:51.070 --> 31:53.231
- THERE'S NO
"OUR NEXT MOVE," SHAWN.

31:53.270 --> 31:54.578
I'M DONE HELPING YOU
GO AFTER CARP.

31:54.610 --> 31:56.100
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

31:56.140 --> 31:57.630
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU AN OUT.
- I DON'T CARE.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.375
THE ONLY REASON
WHY WE'RE NOT DEAD RIGHT NOW

31:59.410 --> 32:02.140
IS BECAUSE THEIR CARD GAME ENDED
AND THEY WENT BACK INSIDE.

32:02.180 --> 32:04.045
JULIET WAS DEFINITELY RIGHT
ABOUT YOU.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.012
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
RIGHT ABOUT ME? ABOUT WHAT?

32:06.050 --> 32:08.018
- THAT YOU'RE TOO EMOTIONALLY
INVESTED IN THIS CASE

32:08.060 --> 32:09.357
TO BE INVOLVED.
- [CIICKS tongue]

32:09.390 --> 32:11.051
- LOOK, I WANT NOTHING MORE
THAN TO BUST CARP,

32:11.090 --> 32:12.626
BUT WE KEEP GOING
ON THIS CRAZY TRAIN,

32:12.660 --> 32:14.321
WE'RE GONNA END UP
LIKE THE BLUEBERRY.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.055
- OKAY, FINE, FINE, FINE!
YOU WANT OUT? THEN GET OUT!

32:16.100 --> 32:17.624
- YES, I WILL, I WILL.
- YOU GET OUT!

32:17.660 --> 32:18.661
- ON SECOND THOUGHT,
I'M OUT OF HERE.

32:18.700 --> 32:19.667
- FINE.
- SEE YA!

32:19.700 --> 32:21.998
- SEE YA!

32:22.040 --> 32:24.338
WHY AREN'T YOU LEAVING?
- I DON'T HAVE A RIDE.

32:24.370 --> 32:27.931
- [sighs]

32:31.110 --> 32:32.270
- GET IN THE CAR.

32:32.310 --> 32:34.016
- ALL RIGHT.

32:34.050 --> 32:35.347
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:35.380 --> 32:38.645
- JUST GET IN THE CAR.

32:38.690 --> 32:42.080
I HOPE YOU ATE.
WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

32:51.030 --> 32:53.123
- ALL RIGHT, JULIAN AND ONE OF
THE GUARDS ARE OUT OF THE HOUSE.

32:53.170 --> 32:54.364
NOW'S THE TIME.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.038
YOU WANT TO GO OVER
THE PLAN AGAIN?

32:56.070 --> 32:57.435
- NOPE. NO, I THINK I GOT IT.

32:57.470 --> 33:00.200
[sniffs]

33:00.240 --> 33:02.128
- LOOK, I'M SORRY THIS IS
AS FAR AS I CAN TAKE YOU.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.398
- LASSIE, YOU'VE ALREADY DONE
ENOUGH TO LOSE YOUR JOB

33:04.450 --> 33:05.747
AND THEN SOME.

33:05.780 --> 33:07.702
PLUS, YOU GOT TO THINK
ABOUT MARLOWE.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.377
THE FACT THAT YOU GUYS
STILL HAVEN'T, YOU KNOW--

33:09.420 --> 33:12.014
- I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOU.

33:12.050 --> 33:13.483
LOOK, JUST--
IF THERE'S ANY SURPRISES,

33:13.520 --> 33:15.715
GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE, OKAY?
- NO SWEAT.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.318
- OKAY.

33:17.360 --> 33:20.022
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
- IF YOU MUST.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.051
- WHY ARE YOU HELPING ME,
REALLY?

33:24.100 --> 33:26.091
- I FIGURE,
THERE WAS NOTHING ON EARTH

33:26.130 --> 33:27.597
THAT WAS GOING TO STOP YOU FROM
GOING AFTER YOUR DAD'S SHOOTER.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.234
- RIGHT.

33:29.270 --> 33:31.409
- I'D DO THE SAME THING
IF I WERE IN YOUR SHOES.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.568
- AND?
- AND WHAT? THAT'S IT.

33:34.610 --> 33:37.431
- YOU CARE ABOUT ME.

33:37.480 --> 33:40.779
- GET OUT OF THE CAR.
- YOUR HEART HEARTS ME.

33:40.810 --> 33:44.280
- SERIOUSLY, GET OUT OF THE CAR.
- ALL RIGHT.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.548
[grunts]

33:45.590 --> 33:47.615
BUT IF YOU JUST
SAID IT ONCE ALOUD,

33:47.650 --> 33:51.359
I PROMISE YOU'D FEEL FREE.

33:51.390 --> 33:54.052
I LOVE YOU, MAN.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.749
I...

33:55.800 --> 33:58.291
LOVE YOU.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.775
HELLO, ASS FACE.

34:15.550 --> 34:17.142
- OH!

34:17.180 --> 34:18.181
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:18.220 --> 34:19.517
- I JUST PICKED UP
THE CRANBERRY

34:19.550 --> 34:20.847
AND THOUGHT I'D SWING BY
TO MAKE SURE

34:20.890 --> 34:22.118
YOU WEREN'T
DOING SOMETHING STUPID.

34:22.160 --> 34:23.354
- WHAT IS THE CRANBERRY?

34:23.390 --> 34:24.857
- IT'S THE LOANER
I GOT FROM THE SHOP,

34:24.890 --> 34:27.120
WHICH YOU'RE NEVER TOUCHING,
BY THE WAY.

34:27.160 --> 34:29.094
IT'S THE SAME CAR,
BUT IN MAROON.

34:29.130 --> 34:30.859
- GREATEST NAME EVER.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.322
- I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO
WHATEVER YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO.

34:32.370 --> 34:33.621
YOU'RE GONNA
GET YOURSELF KILLED.

34:33.670 --> 34:35.399
- NO, NO, NO.
DON'T WORRY.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.237
LASSIE HELPED ME DRAW UP A PLAN
TO GET IN THERE AND NAIL CARP.

34:37.270 --> 34:38.760
- YOU'RE TAKING IDEAS
FROM LASSIE?

34:38.810 --> 34:40.266
MAN, YOU'VE REALLY LOST
YOUR MIND.

34:40.310 --> 34:41.777
- SERIOUSLY,
IT'S PRETTY SWEET.

34:41.810 --> 34:45.177
HERE, CHECK OUT THAT GUARD.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.768
[chuckles]
THAT WAS US.

34:50.820 --> 34:52.879
LOOK, THEY ORDERED CHINESE
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.252
WE INTERCEPTED IT, TOOK IT BACK
TO THE PSYCH OFFICE,

34:55.290 --> 34:57.349
LACED IT WITH A VOMITING AGENT
CALLED IPECAC.

34:57.390 --> 34:59.187
- THAT'S WHY THERE WERE
RANDOM PIECES OF ORANGE CHICKEN

34:59.230 --> 35:00.822
ON YOUR DESK?

35:00.860 --> 35:03.124
- OH, COME ON, GUS,
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.764
- [groans]

35:04.800 --> 35:06.665
- I'M SORRY,
THIS WON'T BE PRETTY FOR YOU.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.531
LOOK, MAN,
I GOT TO INITIATE PHASE TWO.

35:08.570 --> 35:10.731
IT INVOLVES LURING THE GUARDS
AWAY FROM THE HOUSE.

35:10.770 --> 35:12.328
- HOW?

35:12.370 --> 35:15.828
- LASSIE PLANTED SOME EXPLOSIVES
OVER THERE IN THAT AREA.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.609
YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THIS.

35:22.550 --> 35:23.812
- THE CRANBERRY!

35:23.850 --> 35:26.842
- HUH.
I GUESS HE PUT 'EM OVER THERE.

35:26.890 --> 35:28.653
- [retches]

35:28.690 --> 35:30.885
[whimpers]

35:30.920 --> 35:33.184
- PLEASE TELL ME YOU HAVE
INSURANCE ON THAT THING.

35:33.230 --> 35:35.221
- [vomits]

35:35.260 --> 35:37.922
[whimpers]

35:37.960 --> 35:39.666
- I GUESS THAT'S A "NO."

35:39.700 --> 35:41.861
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- CHECK IT OUT.

35:54.780 --> 35:56.771
- FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON!

36:25.780 --> 36:28.908
[bullets firing]

36:28.950 --> 36:31.510
- [grunts, screaming]

36:34.890 --> 36:37.859
- EVENING, JERRY.

36:37.890 --> 36:41.724
- SHAWN SPENCER,
I HAD A FEELING YOU WERE COMING.

36:44.330 --> 36:45.797
I APPLAUD YOU
FOR YOUR BRAVERY.

36:45.830 --> 36:48.264
- YEAH, I WISH I COULD RETURN
THAT COMPLIMENT.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.632
COME ON,
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

36:50.670 --> 36:54.299
- [laughing] NOW, WHY WOULD
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE--

36:54.340 --> 36:55.932
- BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
I WILL BLOW YOU AWAY.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.868
NOW DROP IT.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.649
- HEY, THAT'S MY GUN.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.908
- SO YOU KNOW IT WORKS.

37:07.950 --> 37:09.850
NOW MOVE.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.490
- THINK ABOUT THIS, SHAWN.
I GOT A LOT OF MONEY.

37:15.530 --> 37:17.555
- TRUST ME, JERRY,
YOU'LL NEED EVERY PENNY.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.898
DIRTY COPS ARE ALL THE RAGE
AT LOMPOC.

37:19.930 --> 37:22.398
- THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.500
- JULIAN.
[laughs] I'LL BE DAMNED.

37:25.540 --> 37:26.859
THIS IS
THE SECOND MEXICAN STANDOFF

37:26.910 --> 37:28.730
I'VE BEEN A PART OF TODAY.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.975
- I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW
THE PROPER MEANING OF THAT TERM.

37:31.010 --> 37:32.602
DROP IT.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.679
YOU'RE MAKING THINGS
VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME LATELY.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.813
I'M A VERY BUSY MAN.
- OH, I KNOW.

37:40.850 --> 37:43.557
YOU'VE GOT DONORS TO DEFRAUD
AND WARS TO WORSEN

37:43.590 --> 37:45.558
AND KITTENS TO DROWN,

37:45.590 --> 37:47.956
ALL WHILE MOVING
YOUR OPERATIONS TO, UH...

37:50.000 --> 37:51.490
ANGOLA.

37:51.530 --> 37:52.997
- YES, I FOUND
THEIR GOVERNMENT

37:53.030 --> 37:55.430
TO BE A BIT FRIENDLIER
TO PEOPLE IN MY LINE OF WORK.

37:55.470 --> 37:57.028
- YEAH, WELL, UNLESS
YOU'RE LEAVING IN THE NEXT HOUR,

37:57.070 --> 37:58.833
YOU'RE STILL TOTALLY SCREWED.

37:58.870 --> 38:00.735
I'M BETTING THERE'S A TEAM
OF FBI AGENTS

38:00.770 --> 38:02.032
HEADED HERE RIGHT NOW.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.036
- REALLY?
DID YOU TIP THEM OFF?

38:04.080 --> 38:06.640
- NO, BUT I KNOW WHO DID.

38:06.680 --> 38:10.275
- DOES HE LOOK LIKE THAT GUY?

38:14.020 --> 38:17.387
I'M AFRAID
THE CAVALRY ISN'T COMING.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.957
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

38:19.990 --> 38:22.754
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT A MEXICAN STANDOFF IS.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.688
- [grunts]
- OH!

38:28.870 --> 38:29.894
- HEY!

38:32.710 --> 38:35.031
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD THAT IN YOU.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.900
- REALLY?

38:36.940 --> 38:38.749
THE MAN'S A WRITER...
FROM ENGLAND.

38:38.780 --> 38:40.441
- YOU KNOW, SHAWN,
I USED TO THINK

38:40.480 --> 38:41.879
YOU WERE DIFFERENT
FROM YOUR DAD, BUT YOU'RE NOT.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.616
YOU'RE BOTH STUBBORN,
AND YOU'RE BOTH STUPID,

38:44.650 --> 38:46.345
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO QUIT.

38:46.390 --> 38:48.654
- I'LL QUIT...
WHEN YOU'RE BEHIND BARS...

38:48.690 --> 38:50.112
OR DEAD.

38:50.160 --> 38:52.856
I HONESTLY DON'T HAVE A
PREFERENCE AT THIS POINT, JERRY.

38:52.890 --> 38:54.391
- GOOD-BYE, SHAWN.

38:54.430 --> 38:56.352
[gunshots]

38:59.670 --> 39:00.796
- JULES!

39:00.830 --> 39:02.866
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- NEVER BETTER.

39:02.900 --> 39:04.367
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY THANK YOU
FOR THIS ONE?

39:04.410 --> 39:05.866
- GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.935
- I KIND OF MEANT THAT
RHETORICALLY.

39:10.980 --> 39:12.845
- [sighs]

39:12.880 --> 39:15.769
- I'VE GOT
THE GREATEST GIRLFRIEND EVER.

39:21.590 --> 39:24.013
- [sighs] JULES...

39:24.060 --> 39:26.654
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
SHOOTING JERRY CARP IS EASILY

39:26.690 --> 39:28.658
THE MOST ROMANTIC THING
ANYONE HAS EVER DONE FOR ME.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.157
- WELL, I KIND OF FIGURED
THE WHOLE "COUPLES MASSAGE

39:31.200 --> 39:33.668
FOLLOWED BY A HOME-COOKED MEAL"
THING WAS A LITTLE PLAYED OUT.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.497
- [scoffs]
WELL...

39:35.540 --> 39:37.098
- S0 DO YOU FEEL BETTER
NOW THAT YOU GOT CARP?

39:37.140 --> 39:39.529
- I CERTAINLY
DON'T FEEL ANY WORSE.

39:39.570 --> 39:41.162
DIDN'T MAKE MY DAD
ANY BETTER.

39:41.210 --> 39:44.008
- JUST REMEMBER, YOU'RE NOT
GOING THROUGH THIS ALONE, OKAY?

39:44.040 --> 39:46.975
SO THE NEXT TIME
YOU DECIDE TO RISK YOUR LIFE,

39:47.010 --> 39:48.978
REMEMBER THAT THERE'S SOMEONE
THAT LOVES YOU

39:49.020 --> 39:50.146
WHO'S WORRIED SICK.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.989
- I KNOW.

39:52.020 --> 39:53.009
GUS.

39:53.050 --> 39:54.551
I KID, I KID.

39:54.590 --> 39:55.955
[imitates punch landing]
"OH, BUT I LOVE YOU!"

39:55.990 --> 39:57.150
- [laughs]
- [imitates punch landing] UGH!

39:57.190 --> 39:59.124
[cell phone chimes]

40:01.760 --> 40:03.990
- WHAT IS IT?
- MY DAD'S DOCTOR.

40:04.030 --> 40:05.964
HE SAYS I NEED TO GET
DOWN THERE A.S.A.P.

40:06.000 --> 40:06.819
- WHAT?

40:10.740 --> 40:12.833
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

40:12.870 --> 40:15.998
- HE'S MORE THAN ALL RIGHT.
HIS VITALS HAVE ALL STABILIZED.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.507
HE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

40:17.540 --> 40:20.008
- I WAS JUST TELLING
THE NICE DOCTOR HERE

40:20.050 --> 40:22.917
THAT THIS TRAGEDY
HAS ACTUALLY BROUGHT OUR FAMILY

40:22.950 --> 40:24.440
CLOSER TOGETHER.

40:24.490 --> 40:27.141
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE, JULIET?

40:27.190 --> 40:29.158
- WHO IS THAT?
- [mumbling] I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

40:29.190 --> 40:30.885
- UH, YOU'RE JUST IN TIME,
ACTUALLY.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.524
I'M JUST ABOUT TO REMOVE
HIS TUBES.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.028
HE'LL BE ABLE TO SPEAK
MOMENTARILY.

40:35.060 --> 40:39.997
- THANK YOU
FOR MAKING OUR SHAWN SO HAPPY.

40:40.030 --> 40:42.567
- YOU'RE WELCOME?

40:42.600 --> 40:43.999
- OH.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.031
- DAD, SPEAK.

40:47.770 --> 40:49.579
- CHELSEA,
YOU'RE A SWEET GIRL

40:49.610 --> 40:51.749
WHO PROBABLY HAS A LOT TO OFFER,
BUT I'M A BIT OLDER THAN YOU

40:51.780 --> 40:53.543
AND IN A DIFFERENT PLACE
IN MY LIFE,

40:53.580 --> 40:55.013
SO I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT,
BUT WE SHOULD PART OUR WAYS

40:55.050 --> 40:57.143
AND NEVER, EVER
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN,

40:57.180 --> 40:59.944
SO PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS
PERSONALLY--IT'S ME, NOT YOU.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.581
BUT MOSTLY YOU.
[chuckles]

41:04.630 --> 41:06.757
- [chuckles]
HE'S BACK.

41:10.200 --> 41:14.091
- OH, POP-POP,
LET'S MAKE A BABY.

41:16.970 --> 41:18.858
- I HEAR YOU.
I JUST--I'M JUST SAYIN', POP,

41:18.910 --> 41:20.901
I THINK YOU COULD DO
A LOT WORSE THAN

41:20.940 --> 41:23.238
A CONSIDERABLY YOUNGER BLONDE
WITH BOUNDLESS ENERGY

41:23.280 --> 41:24.941
WHO DOESN'T MIND
GIVING SPONGE BATHS.

41:24.980 --> 41:26.948
- PASS.

41:26.980 --> 41:28.868
LISTENING TO THAT CACKLE
FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS

41:28.920 --> 41:30.979
WAS WORSE THAN BEING SHOT.

41:31.020 --> 41:32.942
- IT'S SHRILL.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.015
WELL...

41:35.060 --> 41:36.880
IN ANY CASE, IT'S GOOD TO HEAR
YOUR VOICE AGAIN.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.024
- THANKS.

41:39.060 --> 41:41.790
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE AN IDIOT
FOR GOING AFTER CARP LIKE THAT?

41:41.830 --> 41:43.923
OF ALL THE STUPID, BONEHEADED--
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

41:43.960 --> 41:45.518
I TAKE BACK
WHAT I JUST SAID.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.060
NURSE, CAN WE GET
SOME MORE TUBES IN HERE?

41:47.100 --> 41:48.863
