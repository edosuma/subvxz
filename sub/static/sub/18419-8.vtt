WEBVTT

01:35.363 --> 01:37.165
What's going to happen?

01:37.198 --> 01:39.367
I don't know.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.436
But for now,
the Führer's condition

01:42.503 --> 01:44.838
is going to be kept
secret from the public.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.476
And if things
turn for the worse?

01:48.542 --> 01:51.078
You're probably going
to have to get Thomas

01:51.179 --> 01:53.181
packed and ready
as soon as possible.

01:53.181 --> 01:56.717
Listen, you're going to have
to be ready for anything.

01:58.819 --> 01:59.853
Helen...

02:01.054 --> 02:03.056
we've been through worse.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.692
We'll get through this.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.496
Stay close to the phone.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.645
You might want
to put those pieces
back in the cupboard

02:24.712 --> 02:26.414
before Nori sees.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.684
No need to dredge up
bad memories.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.426
What bad memory?

02:41.729 --> 02:42.830
Well,

02:42.896 --> 02:43.864
never mind.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.933
No. No. Please.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.335
Tell me.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.806
Come on. You really
don't remember?

02:55.676 --> 02:57.378
You were upset.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.315
I know you didn't mean
to scare the baby.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.256
I did this?

03:10.991 --> 03:12.493
Yeah.

03:16.864 --> 03:20.334
You are different
than what I remember.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.538
You seem to have
found a purpose here.

03:25.906 --> 03:26.974
Meaning.

03:28.676 --> 03:29.843
You are free.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.715
Why, yes, I am.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.721
Nori and I are very happy,

03:40.788 --> 03:43.757
and I'm glad
you're warming to that.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.962
Was I that disapproving?

03:50.130 --> 03:51.732
Look, that-- that night,

03:51.799 --> 03:54.435
Nori didn't actually think
you'd go through with it.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.837
But I ran after you,

03:56.904 --> 04:01.875
and I lost you in the fog
by the bridge.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.311
I got scared.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.313
Scared?

04:05.313 --> 04:07.648
Scared that you jumped.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.003
It's good to see you
happy, too.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.969
Danke, Sylvia.

05:07.575 --> 05:10.143
This is so nice of her,
I'm starting to feel guilty.

05:10.210 --> 05:13.146
Mm. No, no, no.
On the contrary.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.748
You make her happy,
Josef.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.618
It has been so many
years since--

05:20.654 --> 05:22.089
since I had a family.

05:23.891 --> 05:27.628
But now I finally have
someone to share it with.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.064
It's not New York,
but...

05:32.600 --> 05:34.167
yeah, I guess this place
could grow on me.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.503
Good. I'm glad.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.838
We have a bright future.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.873
You mean anschluss?

05:39.940 --> 05:42.510
After that,
there's no stopping us.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.878
There's the space program.

05:44.945 --> 05:48.148
And after we've perfected
the face of the earth,

05:48.215 --> 05:50.017
we can look onto the stars.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.423
You know, if Nicole's friends
could hear the way you talk,

05:55.423 --> 05:57.491
they might be less critical.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.428
So...

06:02.663 --> 06:03.964
you like her, huh?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.298
Nicole.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.435
She's, uh, intelligent,
ambitious,

06:07.501 --> 06:10.871
and she's very pretty.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.339
Glad you approve.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.608
You don't sound
so convinced.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.447
There is, uh...

06:21.014 --> 06:22.916
was--

06:22.983 --> 06:24.485
someone else.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.787
Someone in America?

06:26.854 --> 06:28.522
She died.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.524
Someone you loved, huh?

06:32.125 --> 06:33.160
I'm sorry.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.229
What was her name?

06:36.296 --> 06:37.765
Juliana.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.604
What was your wife's name?

06:45.773 --> 06:48.075
My wife's name was Gerda.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.178
I'm sorry.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.653
To the women we lost

06:59.720 --> 07:03.023
who made us better men.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.658
Prosit.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.860
Thanks.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.703
Reichsminister Heusmann--

07:35.989 --> 07:38.592
Whatever happens,
you stay close to me.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.533
Achtung!

07:55.208 --> 07:56.309
What is that?

07:56.376 --> 07:58.045
The Führer's office,
I guess.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.146
Don't worry.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.752
And a pleasure to meet you...

09:13.020 --> 09:14.221
Josef.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.758
I'm your godfather.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.727
Did you know that?

09:19.793 --> 09:22.095
As a child
of Lebensborn.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.100
I look forward to seeing
a great deal more of you

09:27.167 --> 09:28.869
in the days to come.

09:36.543 --> 09:37.510
Heil Hitler.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.647
Heil Hitler.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.293
Where's the Führer?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.795
The Führer...

09:56.697 --> 09:58.098
is in a coma.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.700
The doctors say

09:59.767 --> 10:03.136
it is unlikely
he will recover.

10:03.203 --> 10:07.507
Until the Party meets
and selects his successor,

10:07.574 --> 10:08.742
the Führer had ordered

10:08.809 --> 10:11.979
that I be named
acting chancellor.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.683
Trust me,
it's not an honor

10:15.749 --> 10:17.785
anyone would want,
Josef.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.588
I don't understand.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.457
You see, this has
happened before.

10:24.524 --> 10:27.194
Once the Führer
was unwell,

10:27.260 --> 10:31.531
and for a time
it was thought
as he would die,

10:31.598 --> 10:32.966
so Reichsmarshall
Göring

10:33.033 --> 10:35.102
declared himself
acting chancellor.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.071
I never heard about that.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.874
That's because Hitler
had Göring shot,

10:40.941 --> 10:43.777
along with his
entire family.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.217
This is different,
right?

10:50.283 --> 10:51.518
- He chose you.
- Yes.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.486
And because
I've been chosen,

10:53.553 --> 10:54.587
I must do my duty.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.890
Well, why?
You're an engineer.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.358
An engineer. Exactly,

10:58.425 --> 10:59.526
and therefore
not a threat,

10:59.592 --> 11:01.729
unlike Himmler
and the others

11:01.762 --> 11:03.230
who would kill
for this,

11:03.296 --> 11:04.631
and very well might,

11:04.732 --> 11:06.734
whether the Führer
recovers or not.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.169
I will be held
directly responsible

11:09.236 --> 11:12.973
for everything that
is bound to go wrong
in the days ahead.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.543
Or maybe they'll thank you.

11:20.180 --> 11:25.452
Ah, the American in you
remains so optimistic...

11:26.887 --> 11:28.756
and naive, Josef.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.959
I want you
to go back there.

11:34.027 --> 11:34.762
What?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.897
Return to New York today.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.432
It is no longer safe
for you here.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.902
Please go.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.490
Thank you for coming.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.159
The rumors are true,
then?

12:06.226 --> 12:09.629
I need to know
if what my father is
telling me is right.

12:09.696 --> 12:10.798
Did he ask you to leave?

12:10.864 --> 12:13.000
Yes, he did.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.536
He's acting Chancellor now.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.605
He's in charge.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.240
So you agree with him.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.443
From a political point
of view or personal?

12:23.510 --> 12:26.246
How about you just give me
a straight answer for once?

12:28.949 --> 12:32.519
Your father is a good man,
but that won't save him now.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.954
He's surrounded by jackals,

12:34.021 --> 12:36.023
and I'm afraid
they will eat him alive.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.926
And if you stay,
they will eat you, too.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.409
Miss Mills.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.711
Hello, John.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.679
May I?

14:06.746 --> 14:08.581
Why, yes, of course.

14:09.716 --> 14:10.984
Is everything all right?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.329
Take a seat.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.171
I was...hoping

14:31.238 --> 14:34.041
we'd have had
this conversation by now

14:34.107 --> 14:36.276
and that you would have
initiated it.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.180
In fact, I'm--

14:41.648 --> 14:44.384
you know, I was prepared
to just sit and wait

14:44.451 --> 14:46.186
until you did so.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.623
But unfortunately,

14:50.690 --> 14:53.793
I can wait no longer.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.996
Gosh, I'm sorry.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.399
I don't know what it is
you're referring to.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.501
You're very good...

15:03.103 --> 15:07.340
in this, uh...
this role you play.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.978
The bird
with the broken wing.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.747
I'm sure it works...

15:14.814 --> 15:17.584
more often than not.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.086
But we both know...

15:20.487 --> 15:24.291
you're much stronger
than you want people to know.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.225
Don't we?

15:25.292 --> 15:27.494
John, I-- I don't know

15:27.560 --> 15:29.062
what it is you think
I've done.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.230
What I know you've done

15:30.297 --> 15:32.199
is withhold information
from me,

15:32.265 --> 15:35.502
despite the fact that I
welcome you into the Reich,

15:35.568 --> 15:36.436
into my home,

15:36.503 --> 15:38.705
and into the life
of my family.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.707
I would never do anything
to harm your family.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.010
If you keep secrets
from me,

15:43.043 --> 15:46.013
you place my family
in danger.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.417
I know you met him,
Juliana.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.687
Hawthorn Abendsen.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.526
The Man In the High Castle.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.066
I couldn't have told you
where to find him.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.268
I know, or you
wouldn't have made it

16:08.335 --> 16:10.403
out of
the Immigration Center.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.440
Well, if you have
his name, you--

16:13.506 --> 16:15.608
you must have
other information.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.812
I only met him once
for a matter of minutes,

16:19.879 --> 16:22.049
and I was drugged.
I don't know what else
I could have given you

16:22.049 --> 16:23.450
that you don't
already have.

16:24.684 --> 16:25.952
What did he say to you?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.287
I didn't tell you
because I was afraid

16:27.354 --> 16:28.888
you'd turn me over
to the kempeitai.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.757
Answer the question,
please.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.129
He wanted to know if I--

16:39.532 --> 16:41.134
He wanted to know
about the film,

16:41.201 --> 16:43.203
the one I gave to Joe.

16:44.737 --> 16:45.938
What about it?

16:46.073 --> 16:48.308
He wanted to know
if I'd watched it.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.312
And?

16:53.313 --> 16:54.981
Am I under arrest?

16:55.082 --> 16:56.516
Just answer the question.

16:58.951 --> 17:03.656
Yes. I watched it.
Wouldn't you?

17:06.859 --> 17:08.361
Tell me what you saw.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.300
Uh...

17:14.734 --> 17:16.336
it shows a bomb,
an A bomb,

17:16.403 --> 17:18.105
destroying
San Francisco,

17:18.138 --> 17:20.107
and members
of the Resistance

17:20.173 --> 17:21.641
being executed
in the street

17:21.708 --> 17:23.110
by Nazis and...

17:25.312 --> 17:26.546
And?

17:28.981 --> 17:30.750
And one of them
was Joe Blake.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.655
But it--
it wasn't real.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.458
Couldn't possibly
have been real,

17:38.525 --> 17:40.127
and I asked Abendsen how
they could have faked it,

17:40.160 --> 17:41.761
but he wouldn't
answer me.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.031
And then the Resistance
came back,

17:45.132 --> 17:47.167
and they drugged me again,

17:47.234 --> 17:48.935
and they locked me
in the trunk of a car,

17:49.001 --> 17:50.470
and you know the rest.

17:54.707 --> 17:55.708
Thank you.

17:58.678 --> 17:59.779
Is that all?

17:59.846 --> 18:03.516
I'd like you to go about
your day, Miss Mills.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.153
No one need know
about this visit.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.620
It'll stay between us.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.623
Yes. Yes, sir.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.221
He knows everything.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.755
He's probably
watching us right now.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.191
Well,
if he knew everything,

18:44.257 --> 18:45.425
he wouldn't need
to talk to you.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.826
Why am I not sitting in a cell

18:46.893 --> 18:48.595
somewhere on my way
back to San Francisco?

18:48.661 --> 18:50.530
I don't know.
He must have another
idea for you.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.865
I've got to get out of here.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.202
Listen, Juliana,

18:55.202 --> 18:57.069
we're hearing
whispers.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.938
The S.S.
is on alert.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.274
They're securing
key locations
around the city.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.843
They're nervous
about something.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.746
And then Smith
chooses today

19:06.813 --> 19:08.348
to show you his hand?

19:08.415 --> 19:09.916
We need to know
what is going on.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.251
Don't.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.486
He told you to go
about your day, right?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.288
So what were you
supposed to be doing?

19:15.355 --> 19:18.090
Lucy and I were supposed
to go and check on Helen.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.226
Well, then you should.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.760
You've got to be kidding me.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.462
Helen may know
what is going on,

19:22.529 --> 19:24.731
and if you run,
Smith will find you.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.534
Unless you help me.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.003
But we both know you're
not going to do that.

19:31.070 --> 19:34.274
You wanted the truth about
the films, about Trudy.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.344
And now you have the most
powerful Nazi in the country

19:37.410 --> 19:38.911
asking about them.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.748
We're close to something.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.350
We cannot stop now.

19:51.758 --> 19:52.959
I'll get it.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.539
Hello, Helen.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.476
Julia, hi.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.810
Just thought
I'd check on you.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.313
I know Lucy was planning
on coming by as well.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.514
Well, that's very sweet,

20:14.581 --> 20:17.149
but I am a little
tied up here.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.319
You going away?

20:23.155 --> 20:24.291
Mm-hmm.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.025
I got picked
by the Hitler Youth

20:26.092 --> 20:28.461
to go on a trip
to Argentina.

20:28.528 --> 20:32.999
Wow. That's fantastic.
Congratulations.

20:33.065 --> 20:33.966
It is an honor.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.868
But Thomas knows

20:35.935 --> 20:38.438
he is not supposed
to tell the whole world.

20:38.505 --> 20:40.407
People do get envious.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.644
So...when do you go?

20:44.711 --> 20:46.846
Thomas, take your things
upstairs, please.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.482
Quickly now.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.660
He's feeling better?

21:02.128 --> 21:04.331
Much. Thank you.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.335
Listen, Helen, I--
I know

21:08.335 --> 21:09.936
how difficult
yesterday was for you,

21:10.002 --> 21:14.441
and I just wanted to say
that you can count on me.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.582
That'll be Lucy.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.684
Yeah, unless you'd
rather us leave you be.

21:24.751 --> 21:28.355
No. No, I'd like
for you to stay.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.256
I could fix us
some lunch.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.425
If you're sure.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.762
Okay.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.434
Hai.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.512
Chief Inspector,

21:52.579 --> 21:54.647
a representative from
the Nazi Embassy is here.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.916
He's asking to speak
with General Onoda.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.018
Who is he?

21:59.085 --> 22:00.720
Oberführer Diels.

22:13.299 --> 22:15.101
Oberführer.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.769
Chief Inspector.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.407
General Onoda is unavailable.

22:20.407 --> 22:22.675
Perhaps I may be of service.

22:22.742 --> 22:26.779
He is upstairs
in his office as we speak.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.481
I will wait.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.784
What I have to say is for
the general's ears alone.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.487
Then I will get him a message

22:34.554 --> 22:38.558
if I knew what the purpose
of your visit was.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.430
Tell him

22:43.496 --> 22:45.432
I am here to defect.

22:49.335 --> 22:51.438
This is lovely, Helen.
Thank you.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.172
You make everything
look so easy.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.647
Did Alice call you?

23:01.814 --> 23:04.517
I spoke to her, yes.
So did John.

23:04.584 --> 23:08.020
She called me six times.
Henry was furious.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.355
She kept tying up the phone.

23:09.456 --> 23:10.990
It's been taken care of.
More wine?

23:11.057 --> 23:12.459
Sure.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.827
Might we have the TV on?

23:14.894 --> 23:16.663
I was hoping
to catch the news.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.531
I'd figure you'd already know

23:18.598 --> 23:20.667
what the stories are like,
given Henry's job.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.334
That's why I want to see it.

23:22.469 --> 23:24.003
He was up most of the night.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.772
Why is that?

23:25.838 --> 23:28.875
Actually, we try not to have
the television on while we eat

23:28.941 --> 23:31.478
or discuss matters
better left at work.

23:31.544 --> 23:34.280
I imagine
it must be difficult

23:34.346 --> 23:36.382
having such important
husbands--

23:36.483 --> 23:38.184
wanting to be
supportive, of course,

23:38.250 --> 23:39.986
but then at home
there's things

23:40.052 --> 23:41.788
they can't talk about,
even to you.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.122
It certainly
can be difficult.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.893
Actually, a woman's
role in the Reich

23:46.959 --> 23:50.396
is to run her house
and rear her children,

23:50.497 --> 23:51.931
and they make the world

23:51.998 --> 23:54.200
look like a completely
different place.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.768
Every choice
that you make

23:55.835 --> 23:57.837
is no longer
about your future

23:57.904 --> 23:59.405
alone.

23:59.506 --> 24:01.040
Everything changes.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.512
You said that you had
a serious boyfriend out west.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.179
You didn't want children?

24:08.314 --> 24:09.749
He did.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.519
I was too scared

24:12.552 --> 24:13.820
to bring a child
into that world.

24:13.886 --> 24:14.987
It seemed...

24:16.288 --> 24:17.524
seemed unfair.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.260
Well, thankfully you're
not there anymore.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.364
Excuse me, ladies.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.804
Hello.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.643
Just one moment.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.551
Hi.

24:44.551 --> 24:45.885
Sorry, honey.
It looks like

24:45.952 --> 24:47.754
I'm going to be
working late tonight.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.623
Okay. Thank you
for letting me know.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.327
Is everything all right?

24:55.394 --> 24:56.596
What was all that
about Alice?

24:56.663 --> 24:57.730
I see.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.699
They went ahead
with the cremation.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.033
- What?
- I know.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.202
They burned poor Gerry
without Alice knowing it.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.604
They say it was a mix-up,

25:04.671 --> 25:06.205
but Alice is still
looking into it.

25:06.272 --> 25:09.441
She's still convinced
it's some kind of conspiracy.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.644
She wanted a post mortem.

25:14.581 --> 25:15.982
Right?

25:16.048 --> 25:17.650
Too late for that.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.485
Do you think there
could be something

25:19.586 --> 25:20.920
in what Alice is suggesting?

25:20.987 --> 25:23.022
Greater Nazi News
Service has learned,

25:23.089 --> 25:25.024
in a last-minute
change of plans,

25:25.091 --> 25:27.326
the Führer will be spending
the next few weeks

25:27.393 --> 25:30.296
in his mountain
retreat in Austria.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.865
Uh, listen, you don't
happen to remember

25:32.932 --> 25:35.367
Martin Heusmann,
do you?

25:35.434 --> 25:36.903
Joe's father?

25:36.969 --> 25:38.605
Yeah.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.840
I just heard from Berlin.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.775
It seems he's been...

25:44.977 --> 25:46.012
promoted.

25:47.614 --> 25:48.781
But that's--

25:48.848 --> 25:51.517
that's good news,
isn't it?

25:51.618 --> 25:53.786
I don't know.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.956
Yeah. I think so.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.157
It certainly...

26:00.026 --> 26:01.761
changes things.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.064
I see.

26:05.131 --> 26:08.735
What does that mean
for the trip we've planned?

26:08.801 --> 26:10.236
I think it just means

26:10.302 --> 26:12.171
we're going to have to
wait a little longer.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.040
We certainly
shouldn't pack yet.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.310
No more said, okay?

26:22.448 --> 26:24.016
I understand.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.317
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

26:39.365 --> 26:42.001
Perched high in spectacular
Alpine scenery

26:42.068 --> 26:44.671
stands the Führer's
dominating house frontier.

26:44.737 --> 26:47.674
Just peering up at this
magnificent medieval castle

26:47.740 --> 26:49.341
fills the viewer with awe.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.210
With so few
moments to himself,

26:51.277 --> 26:53.179
it is here
that the Führer comes

26:53.245 --> 26:54.380
to clear his mind

26:54.446 --> 26:56.515
and enjoy
his favorite pastime.

26:56.582 --> 26:58.084
That's what you've
been wanting to see?

26:58.150 --> 27:00.486
Henry was on the phone
all night with Berlin.

27:00.552 --> 27:03.155
The Ministry of Information
wanted the broadcast service

27:03.222 --> 27:06.025
to air footage
of the Führer's
holiday retreat

27:06.092 --> 27:07.259
all day today.

27:07.326 --> 27:08.294
But this

27:08.360 --> 27:09.862
is old footage.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.564
They had Henry pull it
from the archive.

27:12.699 --> 27:15.167
- Why?
- Why do you think?

27:15.234 --> 27:17.603
When you have to result
to old footage,

27:17.704 --> 27:19.706
it means you can't
get anything new.

27:19.772 --> 27:22.809
Maybe because there'll
never be anything new.

27:22.875 --> 27:26.445
That's treason
even to suggest it.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.314
...over the next few wee--

27:29.849 --> 27:31.884
I-- I'm sorry.
I was just--

27:31.951 --> 27:33.452
Just gossiping
as usual.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.021
I'm sorry, Helen.
It was my fault.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.288
I-- I shouldn't
have asked.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.725
No. You shouldn't have.

27:43.863 --> 27:47.066
We should go, I think.

27:47.133 --> 27:49.435
Uh, thank you
for lunch, Helen.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.870
Yes. Thank you.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.438
Again, I'm sorry.

28:21.768 --> 28:22.969
Sir.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.337
Something
you need to see.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.786
When did this happen?

28:39.819 --> 28:41.020
Within the hour.

28:45.657 --> 28:47.159
No calls.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.402
Kido-tai'i.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.839
One moment, please.

29:12.518 --> 29:15.187
You may speak freely,
Obergruppenführer.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.458
Is it true?

29:19.525 --> 29:20.559
General Onoda

29:20.626 --> 29:22.128
is personally considering

29:22.194 --> 29:25.031
Oberführer Diels'
request for asylum.

29:26.833 --> 29:31.337
And, uh, is it likely
to be granted?

29:32.905 --> 29:34.506
The Oberführer
brought with him

29:34.573 --> 29:37.009
convincing evidence
that our Crown Prince

29:37.076 --> 29:38.978
was shot by Nazi agents.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.490
So...

29:51.557 --> 29:53.292
he is one of them.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.628
Obergruppenführer,

29:56.695 --> 29:58.797
Heydrich's conspirators
could have sent him

29:58.865 --> 30:01.968
to defect at any time.

30:02.034 --> 30:05.337
Why do they seek to provoke
the Empire today.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.376
I couldn't say.

30:12.144 --> 30:15.514
But one thing's certain,
Chief Inspector.

30:15.581 --> 30:19.585
It won't be long before
your actions in this matter

30:19.651 --> 30:20.819
come to light.

30:22.354 --> 30:23.956
There might be a way
I can help you.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.958
Our agreement
was to cooperate

30:26.025 --> 30:28.194
for the benefit
of our nations,

30:28.260 --> 30:29.561
not ourselves.

30:29.628 --> 30:30.662
I know.

30:30.729 --> 30:32.731
But, uh...

30:32.798 --> 30:36.335
to those that don't
understand,

30:36.402 --> 30:38.938
your actions...

30:39.005 --> 30:40.706
could make you
look like a traitor.

30:40.772 --> 30:44.476
Then I will face
the consequences.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.084
As you wish.

30:54.653 --> 30:56.455
Good luck,
Chief Inspector.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.957
To us all,

30:58.024 --> 31:00.026
Obergruppenführer.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.337
Yes?

31:45.404 --> 31:47.473
Have your people worked out
what's going on yet?

31:47.539 --> 31:48.640
Because I have.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.142
I'm afraid you have
the wrong number.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.577
Listen, if they
want to hear it,

31:51.643 --> 31:53.745
you better get me
in front of them right now.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.982
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.883
This is Mr. Willet.

31:57.984 --> 32:00.152
Maybe you're looking
for the Springs.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.621
They used to live here.

32:02.688 --> 32:03.990
Right.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.215
I told you not
to use that number

32:29.281 --> 32:30.582
unless it was an emergency.

32:30.649 --> 32:31.750
It is an emergency.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.419
Did you set
the meeting or not?

32:33.485 --> 32:34.720
Follow me.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.334
Where are we?

32:48.400 --> 32:49.101
Right here.

32:53.772 --> 32:56.275
Used to be part
of an old subway station.

32:56.342 --> 32:59.311
The Nazis actually allow
a place like this?

32:59.378 --> 33:01.047
Well, there's
nothing illegal

33:01.080 --> 33:04.050
about a little booze
and music.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.651
Well,
maybe this music.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.219
But if the Nazis
show up...

33:08.520 --> 33:10.422
they break
into a polka.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.727
Thank you.

33:15.794 --> 33:16.795
Thank you.

33:16.862 --> 33:18.364
We'll be back after a beer.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.112
Hello.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.585
Hello. Who are you?

33:39.651 --> 33:41.820
George said you have
something to say

33:41.887 --> 33:43.455
that I need to hear.

33:45.524 --> 33:46.692
Maybe.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.895
I'll give you what I have,

33:49.961 --> 33:51.330
and then I'm done.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.700
Your bargaining position

33:54.766 --> 33:57.636
depends on the value of
the information to have.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.408
Hitler's dying.

34:02.474 --> 34:05.477
He's been dying for at least
the past decade, dear.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.114
Tell me something
I don't already know.

34:10.249 --> 34:11.483
The broadcasters were told

34:11.550 --> 34:13.619
to put old footage
of him on the news today.

34:13.685 --> 34:18.190
And Helen Smith snapped
when Lucy Collins let it slip.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.126
That would explain
the security alert

34:20.159 --> 34:22.294
and Smith coming
to see you this morning.

34:22.361 --> 34:25.431
Today of all days,
unless you think
that's a coincidence.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.570
If this is true,

34:31.637 --> 34:32.871
it's time.

34:32.938 --> 34:33.939
We'll have to move fast.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.841
Hang on a minute.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.309
I gave you the information.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.511
- I'm done playing house.
- We'll see.

34:46.152 --> 34:48.454
What the hell is she
talking about, George?

34:48.520 --> 34:50.789
Something we've been,
uh, waiting for,

34:50.856 --> 34:54.160
preparing for,
for a very long time.

34:54.193 --> 34:56.562
Hitler's death
is a trigger.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.164
For what?

34:58.230 --> 34:59.431
An uprising.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.336
What if this
is how it happens?

35:05.904 --> 35:07.206
What are you talking about?

35:07.273 --> 35:09.175
What I saw happen
in the film, George--

35:09.208 --> 35:10.942
the end of everything.

35:11.009 --> 35:13.179
What if I just started it?

35:16.415 --> 35:18.450
This is a bad idea.

35:18.517 --> 35:21.187
I bypass the surveillance
on this end,

35:21.253 --> 35:24.556
but the Pons can
hear every word.

35:30.196 --> 35:31.530
Hello.

35:31.597 --> 35:32.631
Arnold.

35:32.698 --> 35:33.832
It's Juliana.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.100
My God,
where are you?

35:35.201 --> 35:36.402
Listen, Arnold,
I don't have long.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.604
Whatever you believe in,
if you truly love Ma,

35:38.670 --> 35:40.439
you get her out
of that city right now.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.208
Oh, Jesus, not this again.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.375
Please listen to me,

35:43.442 --> 35:45.844
and you tell Frank,
okay? And Ed.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.579
Arn, it's George.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.615
Dixon? Dix, what the hell
is going on?

35:49.681 --> 35:52.050
Everything she's about
to tell you is true,

35:52.117 --> 35:53.752
so listen to her.

35:57.456 --> 35:58.857
Hello. Are you there?

35:58.924 --> 36:00.626
I'm here.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.580
Good morning.

36:24.316 --> 36:26.585
You've eaten our nazuki.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.587
There's more.

36:28.654 --> 36:30.956
Oh, I'm--
I'm not hungry.

36:32.157 --> 36:33.325
Thanks.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.363
Juliana
is a special woman.

36:40.131 --> 36:42.268
Yes. She is.

36:42.334 --> 36:45.271
You met her in college?

36:45.271 --> 36:48.607
You already know
this story.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.277
Uh, yes.

36:51.310 --> 36:54.280
Please, tell me again,

37:00.118 --> 37:01.953
We were in college,

37:02.020 --> 37:05.657
but we, uh----

37:05.724 --> 37:07.393
we met at a rally.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.563
Protesting your government.

37:13.164 --> 37:14.900
Remarkable.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.537
She, uh...

37:20.005 --> 37:21.607
ah, she stood out.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.743
She was so bright...

37:26.177 --> 37:27.713
so together.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.317
And brave.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.554
In some ways
she's very Japanese.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.991
That isn't why I fell
in love with her.

37:41.327 --> 37:42.561
I wasn't suggesting--

37:42.628 --> 37:44.396
Look, Dad,

37:44.463 --> 37:46.332
I'm not trying
to forget my heritage

37:46.365 --> 37:49.100
by being an American.

37:49.167 --> 37:50.802
But this is America.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.505
It's a world
where you can be both.

37:55.140 --> 37:56.975
You do understand that,
right?

38:01.713 --> 38:03.014
Noriaki.

38:06.352 --> 38:08.354
I'm happy for you.

38:09.421 --> 38:11.590
And I'm proud to call her...

38:31.777 --> 38:33.712
There's something
I've been considering,

38:33.779 --> 38:37.849
and...well, what I'm
trying to say is this.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.519
I think that we--
uh, the three of us,

38:40.586 --> 38:41.953
you, me, and Frank--

38:43.422 --> 38:44.523
Well, here it is.

38:44.590 --> 38:47.225
I think we make
a pretty good team.

38:47.292 --> 38:49.928
I thought you hated us.

38:51.397 --> 38:54.099
It's true
that, as house guests,

38:54.165 --> 38:56.435
you leave much
to be desired.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.804
You're incredibly uncouth,

38:58.870 --> 39:01.139
and, as you've discovered
for yourself,

39:01.206 --> 39:03.842
I do like my privacy.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.811
There's a "but"
in there, right?

39:05.877 --> 39:07.045
Yes.

39:07.112 --> 39:11.683
You've shown some
promise as a salesman.

39:13.151 --> 39:15.421
Great promise, in fact.

39:15.421 --> 39:18.690
And Frank
is a real talent.

39:18.757 --> 39:21.493
His forgeries
have more wu

39:21.560 --> 39:23.795
than many actual artifacts
I've come across.

39:23.862 --> 39:28.299
So you put those qualities
alongside my contacts

39:28.434 --> 39:30.168
and my reputation,

39:30.235 --> 39:31.803
and the fact
that we're no longer

39:31.870 --> 39:34.540
under the thumb
of the Yakuza,

39:34.606 --> 39:36.675
think of the profit
we could make.

39:38.343 --> 39:39.978
Are you asking us
to become partners?

39:40.045 --> 39:44.450
I am suggesting a very
limited business venture

39:44.483 --> 39:46.217
within clearly defined
parameters.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.820
You're asking us
to become partners.

39:50.556 --> 39:51.690
Ed.

39:53.592 --> 39:56.094
Can I talk to you
for a second?

39:56.161 --> 39:57.496
Yeah.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.132
You mind giving us a minute?

40:01.199 --> 40:02.133
I beg your pardon?

40:02.200 --> 40:03.635
I need a minute.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.173
I'll ask him.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.182
By all means.

40:23.321 --> 40:24.556
It's his place, Frank.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.091
He'll get over it.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.062
I don't even know you
anymore.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.331
Why?

40:33.398 --> 40:34.733
Because I don't
sit around with you

40:34.800 --> 40:36.367
waiting for things
to just change?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.870
No. because you used
to be a nice guy

40:38.937 --> 40:40.438
who looked out
for me and Jules,

40:40.506 --> 40:41.807
but now you're
just an asshole.

40:41.873 --> 40:42.974
She left, Ed,
with another guy.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.644
Yeah? Well, maybe
she was right to.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.414
I don't want to argue.
I need your help.

40:49.481 --> 40:50.549
We-- We need your help.

40:50.616 --> 40:53.018
"We"? I told you, Frank.

40:53.084 --> 40:55.020
I don't want anything more
to do with the Resistance.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.188
The Pons are building
an atomic bomb

40:57.255 --> 40:59.758
right here
in San Francisco.

41:01.760 --> 41:02.561
What?

41:02.628 --> 41:04.530
We're going to do
something

41:04.596 --> 41:06.131
to stop it.

41:06.197 --> 41:07.533
How?

41:07.533 --> 41:09.535
With the explosive
we've recovered.

41:09.535 --> 41:10.669
Are you listening
to yourself?

41:10.736 --> 41:12.370
Come on, please,
stick with me.

41:12.437 --> 41:13.739
You're all I've got.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.841
There's a gentleman here
to see you, Mr. Frink.

41:17.008 --> 41:17.976
Who is it?

41:18.043 --> 41:20.579
I've learned some time
ago not to ask.

41:32.357 --> 41:33.592
Well?

41:35.561 --> 41:37.696
Uh, he says
he'll think about it.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.571
Arnold?

41:48.106 --> 41:50.576
What the hell
are you doing here?

41:50.609 --> 41:51.910
How did you know
where I was?

41:51.977 --> 41:53.378
I called Ed's grandfather.

41:53.444 --> 41:56.582
I figured if I could find
Ed, I could find you.

41:56.615 --> 41:57.916
Is Anne all right?

41:57.983 --> 41:59.618
She will be.

41:59.685 --> 42:02.253
Frank, I just
came here to tell you

42:02.320 --> 42:04.255
that we're leaving today.

42:09.094 --> 42:11.797
I didn't think your employer
allowed you to take time off.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.331
I don't work for them anymore,

42:13.398 --> 42:16.602
and I'm not talking
about any kind of vacation.

42:16.635 --> 42:17.769
We're leaving for good,

42:17.836 --> 42:19.337
and I was asked to come here

42:19.404 --> 42:20.606
to suggest to you

42:20.639 --> 42:22.040
that you should do
the same thing.

42:22.107 --> 42:23.274
Oh, yeah? Why?

42:30.315 --> 42:32.250
Frank, Hitler is dying,

42:32.317 --> 42:36.154
and when he goes, there's going
to be a Resistance uprising,

42:36.221 --> 42:39.390
not to mention
a very good chance

42:39.457 --> 42:42.093
that this entire city's going
to be wiped off the planet

42:42.160 --> 42:44.630
- by an A bomb.
- Who told you that?

42:45.664 --> 42:47.165
You don't think
I'm crazy?

42:47.232 --> 42:48.634
Who, Arnold?

42:50.401 --> 42:52.203
Juliana.

42:52.270 --> 42:54.139
She called me.

42:57.442 --> 42:58.644
Ju--

43:00.746 --> 43:02.547
But how did she--

43:02.648 --> 43:04.783
Yeah. Yeah,
her Nazi boyfriend.

43:04.850 --> 43:07.318
Hold on. Wait a minute. Frank.

43:07.385 --> 43:09.655
She is in the Reich,

43:09.655 --> 43:11.857
but she's not with the Nazis.

43:11.923 --> 43:14.192
She's working
with the Resistance.

43:14.259 --> 43:17.328
No, she's lying
to you, Arnold.
She's been lying--

43:17.395 --> 43:19.898
It did not come
from her, Frank.

43:20.932 --> 43:22.467
It came from an old
war buddy of mine

43:22.533 --> 43:23.735
and the kind of guy

43:23.802 --> 43:25.536
who would give up
his life for you.

43:25.671 --> 43:26.905
He wouldn't lie.

43:26.972 --> 43:29.140
And did he know
about your day job?

43:31.109 --> 43:32.678
All right.

43:32.744 --> 43:34.579
Frank, that's fair.

43:34.680 --> 43:36.381
I wouldn't expect you
to understand

43:36.447 --> 43:37.716
what I did for my family,

43:37.783 --> 43:40.351
but do not call
my daughter a liar.

43:40.418 --> 43:41.720
She never betrayed you.

43:41.787 --> 43:43.521
She never betrayed
any of us.

43:43.588 --> 43:44.723
And I'm here today

43:44.790 --> 43:46.291
because
she asked me to come

43:46.357 --> 43:49.695
and tell you and Ed
to get the hell
out of this city...

43:50.996 --> 43:52.998
because she still
cares about you.

43:56.301 --> 43:57.736
So I did it.

43:59.037 --> 44:01.239
The rest is up to you.

44:18.556 --> 44:20.158
Change of plans, Frank.

44:20.225 --> 44:21.960
We're moving up
our time table.

44:22.027 --> 44:23.161
Because Hitler's dying

44:23.228 --> 44:24.730
and there's going
to be an uprising.

44:26.464 --> 44:28.233
How would you know that?

44:28.299 --> 44:31.136
Is Juliana working
with the Resistance?

44:34.272 --> 44:35.206
Did you know?

44:35.273 --> 44:36.842
Of course not.

44:36.908 --> 44:38.509
How could you be
okay with that?

44:38.576 --> 44:40.045
Not my call.

44:40.111 --> 44:41.747
You fucking
manipulated me.

44:41.780 --> 44:43.048
You let me believe
Jules was a traitor.

44:43.114 --> 44:44.515
Because she is,
and when she's done

44:44.582 --> 44:45.851
being useful to our people,

44:45.917 --> 44:47.085
she's going to get
what she deserves.

44:47.152 --> 44:48.619
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

44:48.754 --> 44:50.889
This is war. It's bigger
than all of us.

44:50.956 --> 44:52.223
So stop making this

44:52.290 --> 44:54.425
about your own personal
bullshit, Frank.

45:10.809 --> 45:12.277
I know.

45:12.343 --> 45:14.780
I really thought
she ran off with him.

45:15.781 --> 45:17.215
This whole time...

45:19.017 --> 45:21.820
we were fighting
for the same side.

45:22.954 --> 45:24.589
It wasn't just you,
Frank.

45:24.655 --> 45:25.824
I doubted Jules, too.

45:25.891 --> 45:27.893
You never hated her, Ed.

45:29.027 --> 45:32.430
You know,
I actually hated her.

45:38.436 --> 45:39.838
Well, now that we
know the truth,

45:39.905 --> 45:41.339
what are we going to do?

45:42.573 --> 45:43.975
I don't know.

45:46.544 --> 45:47.846
You can't let them hurt her.

45:47.913 --> 45:49.114
They're not going
to listen to me.

45:49.180 --> 45:50.481
They think she's a traitor.

45:53.584 --> 45:55.686
We never had to pay
the Yakuza.

45:55.821 --> 45:57.022
We could use that money

45:57.088 --> 45:58.723
to buy two plane tickets
to New York.

45:58.824 --> 45:59.991
I'm part
of something now.

46:00.058 --> 46:01.259
I can't just leave.

46:01.326 --> 46:03.161
Because it's more
important to you

46:03.228 --> 46:04.830
to get revenge
for Laura and the kids.

46:04.830 --> 46:06.131
No. No,
that's not the reason.

46:06.197 --> 46:07.833
You're about
to bomb the building

46:07.899 --> 46:09.700
where they killed them.
Of course that's the reason.

46:09.835 --> 46:11.402
It's bigger than I am.

46:12.570 --> 46:14.005
That's your pal Gary
talking.

46:14.072 --> 46:17.308
The same asshole
who wants to kill Jules.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.444
You don't owe the Resistance
anything, Frank.

46:19.510 --> 46:20.611
Come with me.

46:20.678 --> 46:22.881
They gas people like me
in the Reich.

46:22.948 --> 46:24.182
Then I'll go.

46:24.249 --> 46:26.852
Heck, they gas people
like you, too.

46:26.852 --> 46:28.854
I'll risk it.

46:28.887 --> 46:30.889
You don't even know
how to find her.

46:34.059 --> 46:36.494
We can't
just do nothing.

46:38.663 --> 46:40.465
This whole time,
I convinced myself

46:40.531 --> 46:41.867
I was the one saving her,

46:41.900 --> 46:43.869
but it was
the other way around.

46:43.902 --> 46:47.105
She can take care
of herself.

46:47.172 --> 46:49.340
She's stronger
than both of us, Ed.

47:27.645 --> 47:29.180
Dad?

47:31.282 --> 47:32.450
Dad?

49:39.277 --> 49:41.112
Josef, what are you
still doing here?

49:41.179 --> 49:42.313
I'm not leaving.

49:42.380 --> 49:43.681
Josef, you must
understand that--

49:43.748 --> 49:45.683
That I could get myself
killed by staying here.

49:45.750 --> 49:46.917
I know.

49:47.052 --> 49:49.820
The girl I lost died for me

49:49.887 --> 49:51.422
because,
for some crazy reason,

49:51.489 --> 49:53.824
she believed
that my life mattered.

49:53.891 --> 49:56.094
And I think,
being here with you,

49:56.161 --> 49:58.096
maybe it can.

50:00.531 --> 50:02.100
Please.

50:02.167 --> 50:04.402
Don't send me away.

50:42.773 --> 50:44.309
Obersgruppenführer,

50:44.375 --> 50:46.377
if you will please
get dressed,

50:46.444 --> 50:48.613
we must evacuate you
immediately.

51:24.615 --> 51:28.453
Please forgive our hastiness,
Obersgruppenführer.

51:30.221 --> 51:32.290
We don't afford to take
chances with your safety

51:32.357 --> 51:33.824
at a time like this.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.427
Reinhardt...

51:38.163 --> 51:39.697
I don't speak for myself.

51:39.764 --> 51:41.666
What is this?

51:41.732 --> 51:42.667
Please.

51:44.302 --> 51:46.471
Please hear me out.

51:50.608 --> 51:53.244
I know it's too late for me.

51:54.879 --> 51:56.247
I accept that.

51:57.948 --> 52:00.785
But I ask you to bear in mind

52:00.851 --> 52:02.653
that I was just a soldier...

52:04.189 --> 52:07.192
a loyal soldier...

52:07.225 --> 52:08.726
doing his duty.

52:08.793 --> 52:13.097
Am I to believe
the Führer is dead?

52:13.198 --> 52:15.200
I ask you one thing.

52:17.302 --> 52:19.770
Will you give me your word

52:19.837 --> 52:23.408
that you will spare Helen
and the children?

52:26.344 --> 52:29.280
How do I know
this is not a deception?

52:33.284 --> 52:34.852
I wish it were.

52:37.655 --> 52:38.556
One hour ago,

52:38.623 --> 52:40.090
San Francisco was flattened

52:40.225 --> 52:41.459
with an atomic blast.

52:41.526 --> 52:45.696
I won't presume
to tell you the details,

52:45.763 --> 52:48.499
but our invasion of the
Pacific States is underway.

52:50.235 --> 52:53.003
And then I receive
an order from Berlin

52:53.070 --> 52:55.373
demanding your
immediate release.

52:58.243 --> 52:59.677
You won, Reinhardt.

53:01.579 --> 53:02.613
You won.

53:31.141 --> 53:34.279
You had your chance, John,

53:34.312 --> 53:35.880
and now...

53:35.946 --> 53:38.883
you are on the wrong
side of history.

53:38.949 --> 53:42.287
When the Japanese
are eradicated,

53:42.287 --> 53:43.888
we will have a better world.

53:45.122 --> 53:47.992
A world, sadly,

53:48.058 --> 53:50.861
you will now never see.

54:03.808 --> 54:06.577
Do I have your word that you
will spare my family?

54:06.644 --> 54:10.948
That is up to the new Führer.

54:17.322 --> 54:19.457
It's not you?

54:22.627 --> 54:24.595
No.

54:24.662 --> 54:29.634
It is someone with
a much grander vision.

54:47.251 --> 54:49.354
Heil Heusmann!

54:49.420 --> 54:50.855
Sieg heil!

54:50.921 --> 54:52.590
Seig heil!

55:00.365 --> 55:01.899
Reinhardt?

55:01.966 --> 55:03.734
Yes, John.

55:06.704 --> 55:08.172
Thank you.

55:24.489 --> 55:26.391
Cancel the film.

55:38.102 --> 55:40.170
We're too late.
