00:46.666 --> 00:48.751
Eyes on Kahili objective.

00:49.711 --> 00:53.465
19:30 hours.
Entering surveillance hour four.

00:54.507 --> 00:56.176
No sign of target.

01:01.723 --> 01:03.183
Noncombatant approaching.

01:14.652 --> 01:15.862
Two noncombatants.

01:15.945 --> 01:18.948
<i>Fresh op. New heading, 1-8-0.</i>

01:19.866 --> 01:22.660
<i>Insurgents sighted four klicks north,
deploying weapons.</i>

01:26.706 --> 01:29.751
Sensor, slew the ball
to new coordinates.

02:04.661 --> 02:06.287
Eyes on new objective.

02:07.205 --> 02:08.413
Throttling back.

02:08.497 --> 02:12.168
<i>Guns are hot. Target qualifies.
Engage at your discretion.</i>

02:12.252 --> 02:13.419
Roger that.

02:20.218 --> 02:22.720
Civilian bus, one klick south.

02:25.265 --> 02:28.184
<i>Too close, Major.
Get the strike on this pass, or abort.</i>

02:29.686 --> 02:30.770
Copy that.

02:31.771 --> 02:32.772
I can get it.

02:32.897 --> 02:33.898
<i>Rifle when ready.</i>

02:33.982 --> 02:35.483
Master arm hot.

02:35.567 --> 02:37.110
Fly the laser.

02:37.193 --> 02:38.528
<i>Target, lasered.</i>

02:39.404 --> 02:41.155
Three, two,

02:42.073 --> 02:44.284
one, rifle.

02:44.742 --> 02:48.079
Missile away.
Time of flight, 10 seconds.

02:58.256 --> 02:59.299
Splash.

03:14.981 --> 03:16.316
Good kill.

03:18.985 --> 03:20.903
Well, they don't call it
a Hellfire for nothing.

03:20.987 --> 03:24.032
Best use of $68,000 taxpayer dollars
I've seen today.

03:24.115 --> 03:26.409
Master arm off. Weapon's safe.

03:27.118 --> 03:28.494
Laser safe.

03:29.329 --> 03:30.455
Damage assessment.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.501
Come on, Carlos. Tighten up.

03:38.338 --> 03:39.339
What's the body count?

03:44.010 --> 03:45.637
I count six, sir.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.514
But good luck figuring out
which bits go in what casket.

03:49.641 --> 03:51.934
Setting a course for J-bad.

03:53.895 --> 03:55.188
Watch yourself, Tommy.

03:55.355 --> 03:57.398
You're beak-to-beak
with that Reaper relieving you.

03:57.482 --> 03:58.816
- Yes, sir.
- Two o'clock.

03:59.275 --> 04:02.487
MQ-9. American engineering
at its finest.

04:03.696 --> 04:06.616
All right. Hand off to
Captain Christie for recovery.

05:20.648 --> 05:21.858
Is that real?

05:23.943 --> 05:27.029
You ever get to, like,
fly in a war or something?

05:29.157 --> 05:32.160
Blew away six Taliban
in Pakistan just today.

05:33.453 --> 05:34.787
Now I'm going home to barbeque.

05:35.163 --> 05:36.497
Yeah, right.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.535
- It's not my fault.
- Travis, get back here right now.

06:15.536 --> 06:18.039
Get back here
and pick up the crap you just dumped!

06:18.122 --> 06:20.583
Do not walk away from me, young man!

06:21.000 --> 06:22.710
Do not walk away from me.

06:24.003 --> 06:25.338
Travis!

06:28.299 --> 06:30.343
Feel free to step in anytime, Tommy.

06:30.426 --> 06:31.636
I'll talk to him.

06:32.345 --> 06:36.098
I got a call from the principal's office.
He was fighting with another boy.

06:36.182 --> 06:37.558
Did he Win?

06:39.477 --> 06:42.480
Hey, Jesse, how's that book?
You recommend it?

06:43.356 --> 06:46.484
- Sorry the house looks like...
- A bomb hit it?

06:47.819 --> 06:49.028
I didn't say it.

06:49.445 --> 06:52.240
I'd ask how your day was,
but there's a limit...

06:52.323 --> 06:53.449
- I know. I'm sorry.
- How many times

06:53.533 --> 06:55.868
- I can ask the same question.
- Thank you for not asking.

06:57.370 --> 06:59.831
You know he's flunking math.
He needs a tutor.

07:00.706 --> 07:04.001
How much will that cost?
Can't you help him?

07:05.127 --> 07:07.964
Where do you think he gets it from?
I'm the reason he's flunking.

07:08.047 --> 07:09.507
That's true.

07:10.132 --> 07:11.801
I start nights tomorrow.

07:14.220 --> 07:15.471
Okay.

07:51.757 --> 07:53.551
You look miles away.

07:57.597 --> 07:58.764
Seven thousand?

08:01.392 --> 08:02.685
That's a joke.

08:07.106 --> 08:09.108
I think I'm gonna go get a glass of water.

08:10.651 --> 08:12.278
You need anything?

08:15.448 --> 08:16.616
Yeah, I do.

08:31.881 --> 08:33.299
Living the dream, Tommy.

08:34.299 --> 08:35.842
Hey, Dan.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.372
Ladies and gentlemen,
the aircraft you're looking at

09:04.455 --> 09:06.624
is not the future of war.

09:06.707 --> 09:08.793
It is the here and fucking now.

09:09.377 --> 09:10.795
Any time of day or night,

09:10.878 --> 09:13.965
there are dozens of
these things in the sky

09:14.048 --> 09:15.424
above our theaters of operation.

09:15.508 --> 09:19.387
And most are currently working in the
Garden of Eden they call Afghanistan.

09:19.470 --> 09:21.870
Where they're starting to think
it's their new national bird.

09:22.974 --> 09:24.266
Now, I assume you know

09:24.350 --> 09:26.602
we don't fly them all the way there
from here in Vegas,

09:26.686 --> 09:28.437
but I guess I shouldn't assume anything.

09:28.521 --> 09:30.856
I got food in my fridge
older than most of you.

09:30.982 --> 09:33.776
Now, all take-offs and landings occur

09:33.859 --> 09:36.529
in and around
whatever godforsaken place

09:36.612 --> 09:38.531
we're at war with that day.

09:38.614 --> 09:41.784
That's 'cause these things are a bitch
to take off and land.

09:41.867 --> 09:44.120
So once they're airborne,
that's when we take over.

09:44.203 --> 09:46.664
And these gentlemen here are gonna
take you through the nuts and bolts

09:46.747 --> 09:48.082
of exactly how we do that.

09:49.208 --> 09:52.837
But before they do, there's one thing
I want to say about this program.

09:53.295 --> 09:55.548
We get a lot of shit from the public.

09:56.007 --> 09:58.801
And I've heard
all the bleeding heart arguments.

09:58.884 --> 10:01.095
I've read all the fucking bumper stickers.

10:01.178 --> 10:02.847
"It's not the air force,
it's the chair-force,"

10:02.930 --> 10:04.265
"waging a Wii war."

10:04.807 --> 10:07.727
It's all a waste of breath
because the United States Air Force

10:07.810 --> 10:10.229
is ordering more drones than jets.

10:10.771 --> 10:14.191
Excuse me, "remotely piloted aircraft."
You can call them whatever you want.

10:15.359 --> 10:17.236
Drones aren't going anywhere.

10:17.903 --> 10:19.780
In fact, they're going everywhere.

10:23.909 --> 10:26.579
But don't think I believe
my own shit either.

10:26.746 --> 10:30.249
'Cause we like to dress it up
in fancy language.

10:31.751 --> 10:35.588
Prosecuting a target, a surgical strike,

10:35.671 --> 10:37.506
neutralizing the threat.

10:38.090 --> 10:40.259
Make no fucking mistake about it.

10:41.761 --> 10:43.262
We are killing people.

10:44.055 --> 10:46.390
So I'm gonna drill this into your heads
every goddamn day.

10:46.474 --> 10:48.434
This ain't fucking PlayStation.

10:50.436 --> 10:54.190
Even though the brass
don't like to admit it,

10:54.273 --> 10:56.275
our operation was modeled on Xbox.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.320
And half of you were recruited in malls

10:59.403 --> 11:02.364
precisely because
you are a bunch of fucking gamers.

11:02.448 --> 11:04.950
And war is now a first-person shooter.

11:05.034 --> 11:07.119
But you pull a trigger here,

11:07.203 --> 11:08.704
it's for fucking real.

11:11.791 --> 11:14.293
Ain't a bunch of pixels
you're blowing up.

11:17.630 --> 11:21.634
It's flesh and fucking blood.

11:23.844 --> 11:26.347
You pull a trigger here,
someone's gonna go away.

11:27.473 --> 11:29.809
Now, go away.

11:31.936 --> 11:33.395
Dismissed.

11:33.479 --> 11:34.939
Atten-hut!

11:35.689 --> 11:38.317
That's a lot of recruits
for a war that's ending.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.070
So what'd you log?
3,000 hours in F-16s,

11:41.153 --> 11:44.156
six tours, 200 combat sorties
before you got here?

11:44.240 --> 11:47.660
Now they give them 40 hours in
a fucking Cessna and send them to me.

11:47.743 --> 11:49.495
And pretty soon they won't even do that.

11:49.578 --> 11:52.623
Just shove a joystick
in their clammy mitts on day one.

11:54.125 --> 11:56.585
By the way, I got a new co-pilot for you.

11:57.002 --> 12:00.673
Last test, Carlos pissed hot. Coke.

12:01.257 --> 12:02.675
I mean, I reckon
he wanted to get busted.

12:02.758 --> 12:04.176
You saw how he was shaking.

12:04.677 --> 12:08.097
It was classic burn-out.
You burn out at 24.

12:08.180 --> 12:10.766
I mean, when I was 24,
burn-out hadn't been invented yet.

12:10.850 --> 12:12.101
Is that her there?

12:12.184 --> 12:14.436
Yeah, I know she looks like
a fucking child.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.231
But she's got 500 hours in Reapers,
100 in Predators.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.984
Top recruit from Holloman.

12:20.067 --> 12:23.737
Listen, word's come down the chain
we're stepping up attacks.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.657
'Cause we got intel that says
they're stepping up attacks.

12:27.116 --> 12:28.492
I mean, it's like my football coach
used to say,

12:28.576 --> 12:30.327
"Get your retaliation in first."

12:33.372 --> 12:34.582
What's up?

12:35.207 --> 12:36.876
Can you get me in a plane, sir?

12:38.752 --> 12:41.552
- You not hear what I was just saying?
- No, I heard you. I was just...

12:41.589 --> 12:44.258
They're yanking you jet jockeys
out of your kites faster than ever.

12:44.341 --> 12:48.179
I know how you feel. It's like going from
a Ferrari to a Ford Fiesta, but...

12:49.471 --> 12:51.390
You think any of us love flying at 1-G?

12:54.185 --> 12:56.562
All right, I'll see what I can do. Okay?

12:56.645 --> 12:58.230
- Thank you, sir.
- All right.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.403
Not a word, Drier.
I can't have Egan burn out on me.

13:04.486 --> 13:06.864
I need someone
who can fly these fucking dodos.

13:08.741 --> 13:13.162
How can you feel turbulence hit a plane
7,000 miles away? It's un-fucking-canny.

13:13.871 --> 13:16.665
Everyone else is trying to act like
they're in a plane in Afghanistan.

13:16.749 --> 13:19.251
Egan fucking is in a plane
in Afghanistan.

13:26.926 --> 13:28.344
Suarez, go in tighter.

13:32.389 --> 13:35.726
Fuel window closing. Can't wait
for Johnny Jihad to make a pit stop.

13:35.851 --> 13:37.091
No, I can take him on the move.

13:37.353 --> 13:39.271
- Old Predator, Tommy.
- What's the lag?

13:39.939 --> 13:41.482
Latency at 2.2 seconds.

13:43.609 --> 13:46.528
How do you know where he's gonna be
two seconds from now, sir?

13:46.612 --> 13:48.239
You don't throw the ball
where the receiver is.

13:48.322 --> 13:49.782
You throw where he's gonna be.

13:49.865 --> 13:50.991
Lead them by a cross hair.

13:56.247 --> 13:57.998
One Minnesota, two Minnesota...

13:59.166 --> 14:01.043
Isn't it supposed to be Mississippi, sir?

14:01.126 --> 14:02.461
I'm from St. Paul.

14:03.170 --> 14:04.296
Lead them by another half.

14:08.175 --> 14:09.635
We are cleared hot.

14:09.718 --> 14:12.388
Master arm on. Weapon's hot.

14:13.305 --> 14:16.976
Three, two, one, rifle.

14:18.102 --> 14:19.645
Time of flight, 12 seconds.

14:30.864 --> 14:31.907
Yes!

14:31.991 --> 14:33.492
Got them motherfuckers.

14:34.159 --> 14:35.160
Good splash.

14:38.580 --> 14:41.583
- Tarfu.
- Tarfu? What's tarfu, sir?

14:41.667 --> 14:42.876
Totally and royally fucked up.

14:44.586 --> 14:46.588
And I believe those gentlemen qualify.

14:47.423 --> 14:48.465
Thank you, sir.

14:48.799 --> 14:50.759
So she's looking at me
and I'm looking at her, right?

14:50.843 --> 14:53.887
So, finally I decide I'm gonna go over
and introduce myself to her.

14:53.971 --> 14:56.932
And I say,
"Hi, I'm Captain Joseph Zimmer."

14:57.016 --> 14:58.350
- Nice.
- You know what she says?

14:58.726 --> 15:01.186
She says her name is Anita Mann.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.730
- It's funny.
- Yeah.

15:02.813 --> 15:04.273
Well, she was shitfaced, of course.

15:04.356 --> 15:06.650
At a bar at Mandalay Bay
with five of her girlfriends.

15:06.734 --> 15:08.444
She can't get me upstairs fast enough.

15:09.069 --> 15:12.364
The girl was getting married
the next fucking day.

15:13.115 --> 15:16.118
Last bachelor party I went to,
I was Dick Burns.

15:16.201 --> 15:17.561
It was either that or Hugh Jorgen.

15:19.038 --> 15:20.122
Classy.

15:27.463 --> 15:29.882
- So, did you volunteer?
- Or were you "volun-told"?

15:31.216 --> 15:35.054
I went willingly.
Yeah, I couldn't wait to sign up.

15:35.137 --> 15:38.599
Come on, battlefields and blackjack?
Every girl's fantasy.

15:39.558 --> 15:40.559
<i>You'?</i>

15:40.642 --> 15:42.642
In my line,
this is the next best thing to Langley.

15:43.187 --> 15:46.732
I applied twice, but I never got past
the background check.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.485
For the life of me,
I don't know what it is.

15:49.568 --> 15:52.237
I don't remember doing anything
that fucking bad.

15:52.404 --> 15:56.742
I flew cargo, Globemasters.
I might as well be working for UPS.

15:57.910 --> 16:00.590
If you want to be where the action is,
this is the tip of the spear.

16:08.379 --> 16:09.463
I did six tours.

16:11.548 --> 16:16.011
After the last one, I got back from Iraq,
a row of GCS's on the tarmac.

16:16.095 --> 16:17.805
F-16s in mothballs.

16:18.889 --> 16:21.183
Put in one UAV tour, they said.

16:22.476 --> 16:23.602
I'm on my third.

16:26.688 --> 16:28.273
You got a family.

16:28.357 --> 16:30.526
Must be nice, you know,
go home and see them every day.

16:33.445 --> 16:34.655
We're on duty.

16:52.965 --> 16:54.758
Where superpowers go to die.

16:56.468 --> 17:00.139
Not the British, not the Soviets, not us.

17:00.597 --> 17:04.143
Genghis fucking Khan
couldn't hold onto this fucking place.

17:05.978 --> 17:08.355
No one wins a war in Afghanistan.

17:09.021 --> 17:13.068
The only way to win is never put a boot
on the ground. Stay two miles above it.

17:13.152 --> 17:16.780
We have put in 600 Reaper hours
on this target, sir.

17:17.614 --> 17:22.286
May I respectfully suggest
that we got the wrong address?

17:23.119 --> 17:25.497
That's not what our intel's saying, Major.

17:25.580 --> 17:27.207
It's a safe house
for the new Number Two.

17:32.671 --> 17:33.672
Who's she?

17:33.755 --> 17:37.301
Our intel says she's not related.
Housekeeper.

17:37.718 --> 17:39.386
I always think they can see us.

17:40.345 --> 17:44.516
At 10,000 feet, even if she stared
straight at us, she couldn't see us.

17:45.976 --> 17:47.978
I get tired just watching her work.

17:48.103 --> 17:50.898
My wife by the fucking pool,
she wouldn't last a day over there.

18:16.173 --> 18:18.759
- He's getting good.
- Focus on the compound.

18:32.856 --> 18:35.317
Well, as much as I would like to
watch her put her son to sleep,

18:35.400 --> 18:37.319
I gotta be home before my kids wake up.

18:37.402 --> 18:39.738
- It's all yours, Major.
- Yeah. Good night, sir.

18:58.882 --> 19:01.343
- Is that the target?
- No.

19:02.636 --> 19:04.096
Our target's as round as he is tall.

19:04.179 --> 19:05.597
That's not him.

19:26.827 --> 19:28.453
What is he doing?

19:31.623 --> 19:32.708
Shit.

19:42.759 --> 19:43.760
Jesus.

20:49.701 --> 20:50.869
Hey, Tommy.

20:55.374 --> 20:57.584
So, I heard you want to
go back to combat.

21:02.255 --> 21:03.590
You told Molly yet?

21:05.926 --> 21:07.177
Not yet.

21:07.636 --> 21:10.097
Well, don't take this the wrong way,

21:10.180 --> 21:11.973
but are you out of your fucking mind?

21:13.183 --> 21:14.810
I mean, look around, buddy.

21:15.394 --> 21:17.813
We can come home at night.
We can see our kids,

21:17.896 --> 21:21.441
we can get laid and not worry that
there's some other prick going there.

21:23.235 --> 21:25.821
Listen, I don't even know
if it's going to happen.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.360
It's a big fucking mistake.

21:28.407 --> 21:30.242
- Get him!
- Get him!

21:30.325 --> 21:33.078
Hey, hey! You don't shoot the chef.
What are you, crazy?

21:34.955 --> 21:36.832
Hey, get out of here. No, no, no, no, no!

21:36.915 --> 21:38.750
Come on. I'll cook you.

21:38.917 --> 21:42.087
Come on, no, no, get out of here.
I'll cook both of you.

21:43.714 --> 21:46.133
He's quiet. Does he ever get angry?

21:47.217 --> 21:48.593
Almost never.

21:49.261 --> 21:50.541
What happens when he gets angry?

21:52.681 --> 21:54.433
He gets more quiet.

21:55.934 --> 21:57.811
I'm gonna get a refill.

22:04.025 --> 22:05.026
Wow.

22:06.319 --> 22:07.362
Look at you.

22:08.572 --> 22:10.365
You went all out today, Mrs. Egan.

22:10.449 --> 22:11.575
Shucks.

22:12.784 --> 22:13.785
Cheers.

22:32.554 --> 22:33.805
What is this?

22:39.770 --> 22:41.021
You're resigning?

22:44.816 --> 22:47.652
- You're up for promotion.
- I was going to talk to you about it.

22:47.736 --> 22:49.863
- The pay grade alone...
- Just...

22:51.907 --> 22:54.743
It's only if I don't get
a seat on the Viper.

22:55.827 --> 22:59.039
Combat? That's what you want to do?

22:59.623 --> 23:01.875
So you can worry the kids sick again.

23:01.958 --> 23:04.836
So you never see them or me.

23:07.339 --> 23:11.259
Is it so bad, what you're doing now?

23:12.677 --> 23:14.429
You're still making people safer, right?

23:18.016 --> 23:20.268
I mean, what's going on at the base?

23:20.352 --> 23:23.772
I mean, no one else in the service cares
about the security clearance bullshit.

23:24.731 --> 23:28.193
- I'm your fucking wife.
- It's not about the clearance.

23:29.277 --> 23:33.782
I just don't want to rehash it.
It doesn't do any good.

23:33.865 --> 23:36.993
If I have a shit day, why dump it on you?

23:37.077 --> 23:39.621
Does it help me? Does it help you?

23:39.704 --> 23:42.958
You don't know what helps me. I get it.

23:43.041 --> 23:45.836
I get why you don't want to
talk about that.

23:45.919 --> 23:48.338
But you don't want to
talk about anything.

23:48.421 --> 23:50.966
I swear to God,
if I didn't start a conversation,

23:51.049 --> 23:53.260
we would never fucking have one!

23:57.389 --> 23:59.808
Ever since the drawdown,
things haven't been the same.

23:59.891 --> 24:01.226
You know that.

24:01.309 --> 24:04.396
I just want things to go back
to the way they were.

24:04.563 --> 24:08.900
It might have been scarier back then,
but at least we made each other laugh.

24:10.569 --> 24:12.320
We did it in every room in the house.

24:13.446 --> 24:15.490
We did it in parking lots.

24:17.158 --> 24:20.412
Even if we weren't together all the time,

24:20.495 --> 24:23.164
when we were, we were together.

24:23.915 --> 24:25.750
I used to make you...

24:26.126 --> 24:28.128
I used to make you happy.

24:30.338 --> 24:34.301
Well, I can't be that person
if I'm not doing what I do.

24:35.886 --> 24:38.930
I am a pilot and I'm not flying.

24:39.890 --> 24:41.600
- Tom.
- Just...

24:44.269 --> 24:48.148
I don't know what it is that I am doing,
but it's not flying.

25:08.543 --> 25:09.586
Hey, Major.

25:11.338 --> 25:12.839
How's the war on terror going?

25:13.506 --> 25:15.175
Kind of like your war on drugs.

25:17.969 --> 25:20.513
Yeah. Drive safe.

25:40.075 --> 25:42.744
Nothing explodes quite like explosives.

25:42.827 --> 25:45.246
One IED factory going out of business.

25:46.957 --> 25:50.418
Soon as he comes back from taking
the last piss of his life, we smoke him.

25:51.252 --> 25:53.421
We are cleared hot. Light 'em up.

25:53.505 --> 25:55.006
Warheads on foreheads.

25:57.008 --> 25:59.552
Damn it. Damn it, I lost the link.

26:00.679 --> 26:02.263
The Reaper's on autopilot.

26:02.347 --> 26:05.433
Reaper on automatic holding pattern,
figure eight, deconflicted altitude.

26:05.517 --> 26:08.561
- Get it back.
- I am trying.

26:11.356 --> 26:13.566
All right, I've got it. We're back on.

26:13.650 --> 26:15.151
Laser on.

26:16.778 --> 26:17.779
Painting the target.

26:22.158 --> 26:23.410
Both Hellfires.

26:23.535 --> 26:27.497
<i>I've got two tickets to paradise</i>

26:27.706 --> 26:31.084
<i>Won't you pack your bags
We leave tonight...</i>

26:32.544 --> 26:35.505
Master arm on. Weapon's hot.

26:35.630 --> 26:37.173
Rifle when ready.

26:37.382 --> 26:40.969
Three, two, one, rifle.

26:41.386 --> 26:42.679
Missiles off the rail.

26:45.015 --> 26:46.433
God damn it, what's that?

26:46.558 --> 26:48.643
- Shit.
- Time of flight?

26:48.727 --> 26:50.687
- Seven seconds.
- Abort?

26:51.521 --> 26:53.148
Negative. Impact, three seconds.

26:53.231 --> 26:56.609
Run, you little shits! Get the fuck...

27:05.910 --> 27:06.911
Where are they?

27:26.890 --> 27:28.641
Master arm off.

27:30.643 --> 27:32.228
Weapon's safe.

27:48.870 --> 27:50.413
I know what you're thinking.

27:51.164 --> 27:53.958
I must have been a fucking pilot
before Pontius.

28:01.257 --> 28:03.051
You religious, Major?

28:06.304 --> 28:07.347
You never cuss.

28:08.515 --> 28:11.684
Yeah, I don't think it helps.
I'd do it if I thought it helped.

28:12.143 --> 28:15.480
Maybe it's something I picked up flying.
You know, actually flying.

28:16.481 --> 28:19.192
Yeah, not a lot of hotheads
stay up in the sky.

28:20.401 --> 28:21.736
And those who make it
through flight school

28:21.820 --> 28:22.987
generally owe us for an F-16.

28:26.533 --> 28:28.118
I owe us for a Phantom.

28:34.707 --> 28:36.417
So how are things at home?

28:40.296 --> 28:41.631
Can't complain.

28:42.674 --> 28:46.344
Well, that's the thing, isn't it?
I mean, we really can't complain.

28:47.470 --> 28:49.931
I mean, try telling our sob story
to the grunts on the ground.

28:50.932 --> 28:52.433
I mean, shit, they already thought
we were candy-asses

28:52.517 --> 28:54.517
when we were up in the air
with our fucking planes.

28:54.978 --> 28:58.148
No. No one's throwing
a pity party for us.

29:00.441 --> 29:02.819
You just gotta keep compartmentalizing.

29:04.737 --> 29:07.407
Never mind the compartments
got too close.

29:09.868 --> 29:11.286
I mean, it used to be
we go to war with a country,

29:11.369 --> 29:13.621
we'd actually go to the country.

29:13.705 --> 29:16.499
Guys enlisted to see the world,
get some foreign tail.

29:18.960 --> 29:21.212
It's better when we were deployed.

29:22.463 --> 29:24.883
You know, there was war
and there was...

29:29.721 --> 29:32.015
You know you're not to blame for that.

29:33.641 --> 29:34.893
The kids.

29:37.270 --> 29:39.063
Wrong place, wrong time.

29:39.898 --> 29:41.274
It happens.

29:42.108 --> 29:44.152
Well, it happens.

29:51.576 --> 29:54.662
We all pulled the trigger
in that box, Tommy.

29:54.746 --> 29:55.997
All of us.

29:57.582 --> 29:59.876
Thank you for saying that, sir,

30:01.544 --> 30:03.213
but we both know I pulled the trigger.

30:08.426 --> 30:09.844
Well, you wanna know
how I think about it?

30:09.928 --> 30:11.846
And here's how I think about it.

30:13.014 --> 30:16.768
Just now, we didn't know
those kids were gonna show up.

30:19.103 --> 30:22.023
But they knew. They knew for a fact

30:22.106 --> 30:24.984
there were kids on those 767s
they flew into the Twin Towers.

30:25.068 --> 30:27.820
They had to walk past those kids
to get into the cockpits.

30:32.742 --> 30:34.869
Anyhow, I don't want you
getting gun shy on me.

30:38.122 --> 30:39.457
Take the day off.

30:41.376 --> 30:43.127
I think you get to use a little I&I.

30:44.671 --> 30:46.339
Intoxication and intercourse.

30:47.298 --> 30:48.591
Right.

30:56.891 --> 30:59.477
Why do we wear our flight suits, sir?

31:52.363 --> 31:54.324
What's this about, Drier?

31:58.369 --> 32:01.539
- Drier!
- I'm not at liberty to say, sir.

32:04.208 --> 32:06.502
It doesn't feel like a medal ceremony.

32:10.798 --> 32:12.050
Sit down.

32:13.968 --> 32:15.970
So word has come down from on high

32:16.054 --> 32:18.056
that, for an unspecified
number of missions,

32:18.139 --> 32:19.849
we are to serve another master.

32:20.892 --> 32:22.352
Christians in Action.

32:24.771 --> 32:25.772
The CIA.

32:26.939 --> 32:28.191
- Thank you, sir.
- All right.

32:28.274 --> 32:31.319
- We're taking orders from the CIA?
- Yeah, you're damn straight, Christie.

32:31.402 --> 32:34.405
The CIA takes orders
from the administration,

32:34.489 --> 32:36.824
and since we've sworn an oath to obey
that same administration,

32:36.908 --> 32:39.869
and as much as it pains me
to take orders from a fucking clerk,

32:40.578 --> 32:42.997
yeah, we're taking orders from the CIA.

32:44.499 --> 32:47.335
Now what I want you
to prepare yourselves for is,

32:48.294 --> 32:51.339
the folks in Virginia
operate under a different set of ROEs.

32:52.298 --> 32:55.510
They've progressed from what
they like to call a "personality strike",

32:55.593 --> 32:58.054
where we know for sure
our target is a fucking bad guy.

32:58.638 --> 33:01.118
Now they come up with something
they call a "signature strike."

33:02.725 --> 33:04.060
Now what that fucking means is

33:04.143 --> 33:06.312
it's a hit based
not on a suspicion of guilt,

33:06.396 --> 33:08.439
but on a pattern of behavior.

33:09.399 --> 33:12.777
So you may be called upon to fire at
any dumb shleb in Waziristan

33:12.860 --> 33:15.196
who's carrying an AK-47,
even though we all know

33:15.279 --> 33:19.075
that everyone and their mother
in Waziristan carries an AK-47.

33:19.158 --> 33:20.743
What about their right to bear arms?

33:25.456 --> 33:26.707
I got my own personal opinions

33:26.791 --> 33:29.085
as to why there's been
an expansion of our mission,

33:29.168 --> 33:31.504
which I should probably keep to myself.

33:33.548 --> 33:35.049
But what the fuck.

33:36.759 --> 33:41.222
It's a lot easier to kill these people
than to capture them.

33:41.305 --> 33:44.142
Well, it makes sense, sir. If we
capture them, we have to torture them.

33:48.312 --> 33:49.313
Sorry, sir.

33:50.481 --> 33:52.650
Well, there is the inconvenient matter
of GTMO.

33:53.860 --> 33:56.404
But it's really about the cost
in "blood and treasure"

33:56.487 --> 33:59.532
as those D.C. hypocrites,
who never pay in either, like to say.

33:59.615 --> 34:02.118
They know that if we try to
capture them instead of kill them,

34:02.201 --> 34:04.245
we risk getting killed
or captured ourselves.

34:04.328 --> 34:07.415
And the public
is tired of watching coffins

34:07.498 --> 34:09.041
roll down airplane conveyer belts.

34:09.125 --> 34:13.004
And the Pentagon is embarrassed
by those videos on Al Jazeera,

34:13.087 --> 34:15.840
where some marine denounces America

34:15.922 --> 34:19.677
right before his head's liberated
from his shoulders, so...

34:21.596 --> 34:23.431
In many minds,
out of all the bad options,

34:23.514 --> 34:24.974
we're the least bad.

34:27.893 --> 34:30.062
Don't ask me if it's a just war.

34:33.274 --> 34:34.567
That's not up to us.

34:37.487 --> 34:39.071
To us, it's just war.

34:41.616 --> 34:45.453
Tommy, you take the lead.
Ed, you're backup.

34:45.536 --> 34:46.746
And you get to take over

34:46.829 --> 34:49.248
Tommy's highly-coveted
Kahili surveillance assignment.

34:52.043 --> 34:53.043
All right.

34:56.672 --> 34:59.300
- Let's go to Afghanistan.
- Fly and fry.

35:05.932 --> 35:09.936
Just between us, the Air Force
is making a play with the Pentagon

35:10.478 --> 35:12.772
to run the whole unmanned show.

35:13.231 --> 35:15.691
And they just don't want any

35:15.775 --> 35:19.153
static running missions for the spooks.

35:20.988 --> 35:23.157
And I've always been able
to count on you, Tommy.

35:24.617 --> 35:26.827
You can count on me now, sir.

35:28.287 --> 35:30.289
I take my orders from you.

35:46.556 --> 35:48.057
This is Johns.

35:49.100 --> 35:51.269
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Johns.</i>

35:51.435 --> 35:55.106
<i>Out of all UAV crews
in the 61st Attack Squadron,</i>

35:55.273 --> 35:59.694
<i>Crew 3-2 has been selected
to conduct special operations</i>

35:59.777 --> 36:01.195
<i>in the war on terror.</i>

36:01.904 --> 36:06.242
<i>For reasons of security,
all missions you carry out on our behalf,</i>

36:06.325 --> 36:08.494
<i>effectively never occurred.</i>

36:11.789 --> 36:14.625
<i>You may refer to us simply as Langley.</i>

36:16.877 --> 36:19.213
We're over your
designated position, Langley.

36:19.297 --> 36:21.173
We have eyes on the dwelling.

36:21.257 --> 36:22.925
<i>We see what you see.</i>

36:23.551 --> 36:25.886
<i>The target is Abu al-Mahid.</i>

36:26.137 --> 36:29.974
<i>He attempts to vary his routine,
constantly changes locations.</i>

36:30.057 --> 36:32.727
<i>Never sleeps in the same house
two nights in a row.</i>

36:32.810 --> 36:35.146
<i>But we've discerned a pattern
to his behavior.</i>

36:35.813 --> 36:37.398
<i>According to our observations,</i>

36:37.481 --> 36:40.818
<i>he's due at this structure
in east Herat at 0900.</i>

36:40.943 --> 36:43.362
Sir, they don't look like Taliban.

36:43.446 --> 36:45.781
Well, maybe if they had the guts
to wear uniforms.

36:45.865 --> 36:48.105
<i>- There's</i> a <i>question, Langley...
- We heard the question.</i>

36:48.993 --> 36:51.329
<i>We have solid intelligence
from an informant.</i>

36:51.412 --> 36:54.832
- A paid informant?
- A <i>reliable</i> informant.

36:54.957 --> 36:57.835
Well, he's not that reliable.
The target's late.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.503
A vehicle approaching from the north.

37:00.838 --> 37:04.133
<i>Protocol requires us
to positively identify the target.</i>

37:10.890 --> 37:13.267
<i>- Is that him?
- We 're conferring.</i>

37:18.481 --> 37:22.318
<i>We can confirm. Target qualifies.
Permission to prosecute.</i>

37:23.819 --> 37:25.446
We're obliged to point out, Langley,

37:25.529 --> 37:28.532
we've observed noncombatants
in and around the dwelling.

37:30.493 --> 37:35.915
<i>Colonel Johns, no one regrets the loss
of innocent life more than we do.</i>

37:36.040 --> 37:39.585
<i>We take inordinate care
not to use lethal force</i>

37:39.669 --> 37:41.796
<i>where there are women and children.</i>

37:41.879 --> 37:46.467
<i>Unfortunately, many of our targets
cynically use women and children</i>

37:46.550 --> 37:48.678
<i>as shields to discourage attack.</i>

37:49.220 --> 37:52.181
<i>We have to constantly weigh
the risk to their lives</i>

37:52.264 --> 37:55.601
<i>against the threat posed
to U.S. interests.</i>

37:55.685 --> 37:57.186
<i>Please engage.</i>

38:01.899 --> 38:04.485
It's just there's high winds, sir.
Heavy turbulence.

38:04.568 --> 38:07.655
We're getting tossed around pretty bad,
Langley. It's tough to make a clean hit.

38:07.738 --> 38:10.991
<i>We trust you appreciate
that this is a high-value target.</i>

38:11.158 --> 38:12.326
<i>Please take the shot.</i>

38:13.244 --> 38:15.871
<i>Rifle when ready. You're cleared hot.</i>

38:17.540 --> 38:19.220
Tommy, can you keep her
in a straight line?

38:21.585 --> 38:24.338
Master arm on, weapon's hot.

38:26.090 --> 38:29.385
Three, two, one, rifle.

38:30.010 --> 38:32.680
Weapon's away.
Time of flight, eight seconds.

38:43.816 --> 38:45.025
Splash.

38:45.943 --> 38:47.278
Good kill.

38:47.611 --> 38:50.239
Master arm off, weapon's safe.

38:51.115 --> 38:52.324
Laser safe.

38:52.450 --> 38:54.452
<i>Our compliments, Colonel.</i>

38:55.077 --> 38:57.204
<i>That was a high card
you and your people</i>

38:57.288 --> 38:59.248
<i>just pulled out of the deck.</i>

38:59.331 --> 39:03.335
<i>Al-Qaeda's number one bomb maker
will never again harm one of us.</i>

39:07.173 --> 39:08.966
<i>Please do a follow-up.</i>

39:12.136 --> 39:14.805
Did I hear you correctly, Langley?

39:16.098 --> 39:18.434
<i>There are other combatants
in the vicinity.</i>

39:19.977 --> 39:21.061
Double tap?

39:21.228 --> 39:23.355
<i>We prefer the term "follow-up."</i>

39:23.481 --> 39:24.607
Sir...

39:27.234 --> 39:29.028
They are rescuers. We can't...

39:29.111 --> 39:30.511
The fuck we can't. They're Taliban.

39:30.571 --> 39:32.990
Who do you think the first responders
are gonna be, Quakers?

39:33.783 --> 39:35.785
Those rescuers have RPGs.

39:39.163 --> 39:43.250
- I see people with shovels.
- Then just hit the ones with the RPGs.

39:48.214 --> 39:50.424
Can you confirm that order, Langley?

39:50.508 --> 39:53.260
<i>In our opinion, it's proportionate.</i>

39:54.762 --> 39:57.348
Sir, forgive me, sir.
What the hell does that mean?

39:57.431 --> 40:01.060
<i>It means that in our assessment,
the combatants we are targeting</i>

40:01.143 --> 40:04.104
<i>pose a grave-enough threat
to the United States</i>

40:04.188 --> 40:07.441
<i>to justify potential civilian casualties.</i>

40:07.525 --> 40:11.904
<i>Not to mention that this pre-emptive
self-defense is approved and ordered</i>

40:11.987 --> 40:13.906
<i>by the administration.</i>

40:14.031 --> 40:15.574
<i>Please engage.</i>

40:16.784 --> 40:17.993
Orders.

40:26.335 --> 40:29.171
- Laser.
- Lasing.

40:31.590 --> 40:34.301
Master arm on. Weapon's hot.

40:39.598 --> 40:42.560
Three, two, one, rifle.

40:43.477 --> 40:46.230
Weapon's away.
Time of flight, 10 seconds.

41:04.582 --> 41:07.585
Master arm off.

41:15.509 --> 41:17.469
<i>The subject on the left,</i>

41:19.096 --> 41:20.764
<i>what is she doing?</i>

41:22.600 --> 41:25.019
I believe she's picking
an arm off a tree, sir.

41:27.688 --> 41:29.982
Would they like me to do
further damage assessment?

41:33.068 --> 41:34.278
Hand it off, Tommy.

41:34.945 --> 41:37.281
Captain Christie, take the controls.

41:46.123 --> 41:49.293
Damage assessment, estimate, 12.

41:52.046 --> 41:53.839
Well, we count...

41:54.548 --> 41:56.383
Twelve dead, Langley.

41:56.467 --> 41:57.968
Give or take.

41:59.553 --> 42:01.972
<i>We concur. Signing off.</i>

42:05.768 --> 42:07.561
Was that a war crime, sir?

42:07.645 --> 42:09.647
Shut the fuck up, Suarez.

42:10.272 --> 42:13.233
How'd they decide
the condolence payment is five K?

42:13.567 --> 42:15.486
Sounds like a lot to me.

42:16.070 --> 42:18.113
You could live there on,
like, a dollar a day.

42:21.951 --> 42:23.410
What was that shit?

42:25.829 --> 42:27.498
I didn't sign up for that shit.

42:28.207 --> 42:30.709
That's what terrorists do.
You know that, right?

42:31.752 --> 42:35.005
Plant a second bomb, blow up soldiers
showing up for the first bomb.

42:36.465 --> 42:37.967
Since when did we become Hamas?

42:42.346 --> 42:44.098
"Approved by the administration."

42:45.641 --> 42:47.559
They give Nobel Peace Prizes
for this now?

42:47.643 --> 42:48.978
They sure do.

42:51.522 --> 42:53.482
You wanna talk about all the shots
we didn't take,

42:53.524 --> 42:56.110
waiting for some D.C. lawyer
to come back from lunch?

42:57.987 --> 43:00.280
- No wonder they hate us.
- They always hated us.

43:00.364 --> 43:04.118
We're always gonna be the great Satan
because we got Hustler and Hooters,

43:04.201 --> 43:05.953
and we let women drive
and go to school.

43:06.036 --> 43:08.330
And they're not gonna stop hating us
until the savages

43:08.414 --> 43:10.958
have Sharia law everywhere
on the goddamn planet.

43:11.500 --> 43:13.585
You think you'd have this job
if you were over there?

43:13.669 --> 43:15.671
- Do you think you'd have any job?
- There were kids!

43:15.754 --> 43:17.339
Not our fault. They shouldn't
bring kids into a war zone.

43:17.423 --> 43:18.465
They live there!

43:18.549 --> 43:20.801
Did you get the wrong address, Suarez?

43:21.552 --> 43:24.471
Look around you.
This is a military base. It's what we do.

43:24.722 --> 43:26.765
We're fighting a war
and we're winning it.

43:26.849 --> 43:28.308
They bomb New York lately?

43:28.934 --> 43:32.771
We're saving American lives.
So, fucking sue me.

43:37.443 --> 43:38.569
God is great.

43:39.737 --> 43:41.071
Later, Jane Fonda.

43:41.655 --> 43:44.616
You're a fucking idiot, Zimmer.
No offense.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.869
Actually, offense.

43:49.621 --> 43:51.415
What do you think, sir?

43:52.082 --> 43:54.752
- Those are the orders.
- Yeah.

43:58.088 --> 43:59.715
At least it doesn't give you a hard-on.

44:00.924 --> 44:04.261
Sorry, sir, I could just...
I could kill Zimmer.

44:06.096 --> 44:07.931
Death Junkie Christie.

44:10.601 --> 44:12.269
We should go out on the town.

44:17.858 --> 44:19.401
You know, just our crew.

44:21.028 --> 44:23.697
So we don't end up killing each other
in that goddamn sweatbox.

44:32.289 --> 44:33.332
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Daddy!

44:33.415 --> 44:34.541
Hey.

44:34.625 --> 44:36.293
All right, come on. Get in the car.

44:37.586 --> 44:38.754
No pushing.

44:46.929 --> 44:49.056
What's the Pythagorean theorem?

44:49.139 --> 44:53.185
The square of the hypotenuse
is equal to the sum

44:53.268 --> 44:56.313
of the squares on the other two sides.

44:56.396 --> 44:58.023
There you go. Nicely done.

45:00.359 --> 45:02.444
Did you really need to know
all this to be a pilot?

45:02.528 --> 45:04.988
Absolutely not.
They said I did, but I didn't.

45:05.155 --> 45:07.032
Still, it's good to know it anyway.

45:28.220 --> 45:30.139
The truck's making that noise again.

45:31.849 --> 45:33.725
I'm gonna need to take it to the shop.

45:33.809 --> 45:37.771
All right, well, I'll take a look at it.
Those guys will rip you off.

45:37.938 --> 45:39.022
Okay.

45:59.126 --> 46:00.752
To Crew 3-2.

46:06.508 --> 46:07.718
Fucking Vegas.

46:09.428 --> 46:11.388
You wanna see how civilization ends,
come here.

46:12.055 --> 46:16.935
Caesars Palace, New York-New York,
Paris, The Venetian, Monte Carlo...

46:17.561 --> 46:20.063
- What's the goddamn pyramid?
- Luxor.

46:20.230 --> 46:22.524
No wonder fuck-all Americans
got a passport.

46:23.066 --> 46:24.860
They think the world's all here.

46:25.485 --> 46:26.778
End of civilization.

46:28.071 --> 46:31.033
Who's up for a lap dance, huh?
I'm paying.

46:31.116 --> 46:33.452
- Really?
- No, I'm not.

46:34.077 --> 46:35.162
Dick.

46:47.341 --> 46:48.821
You and your wife
from somewhere else?

46:49.927 --> 46:52.638
I've never met anyone in Vegas
that actually comes from here.

46:52.721 --> 46:54.681
Well, she does.

46:54.765 --> 46:56.683
I met her when she was working
at the Tropicana

46:56.767 --> 47:00.229
about a year before I shipped out
to the sandbox, my last tour.

47:02.105 --> 47:05.567
First date, I took her flying in an F-16.

47:06.443 --> 47:07.861
- That'll work.
- Yeah.

47:07.945 --> 47:11.365
She thought I was exciting
in a boring kind of way.

47:11.448 --> 47:15.244
And a part of her just liked
Uncle's paychecks every 15 days.

47:16.453 --> 47:17.996
What about you?

47:18.747 --> 47:21.833
Battlefields and blackjack?
Still every girl's dream?

47:22.709 --> 47:23.710
I don't know.

47:27.798 --> 47:29.549
How bad do you miss it?

47:32.010 --> 47:33.512
Flying.

47:36.139 --> 47:37.599
I miss the fear.

47:38.976 --> 47:42.104
You're up in the sky,
something can happen.

47:42.938 --> 47:44.731
There's a risk, you know?

47:44.815 --> 47:50.112
I mean, try landing on a carrier
at night or in rough seas,

47:50.487 --> 47:53.490
the deck's pitching 30 feet, low fuel.

47:56.326 --> 47:58.412
We've got no skin in the game.

47:59.955 --> 48:03.292
I feel like a coward every day.

48:04.334 --> 48:09.256
Taking pot shots from half a world away
in an air-conditioned cubicle.

48:09.381 --> 48:14.052
I mean, they get lucky, they shoot
my plane down. I'm not even in it.

48:14.136 --> 48:16.221
All we got to do is
pull another one out of the box.

48:17.681 --> 48:21.810
Worst thing that can happen to me is
carpal tunnel or I spill coffee in my lap.

48:22.185 --> 48:26.356
The most dangerous thing I do
is drive home on the freeway.

48:31.320 --> 48:34.323
Yeah, I get the feeling
I'm gonna die of boredom.

48:42.914 --> 48:46.585
Well, I'm gonna try my luck.

48:47.419 --> 48:49.171
Yeah. All right.

48:51.715 --> 48:52.758
<i>You'?</i>

48:54.134 --> 48:56.303
No, I'd better get going. I got...

49:01.224 --> 49:02.225
Okay.

49:03.393 --> 49:05.062
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

49:32.089 --> 49:33.090
Fuck.

49:40.597 --> 49:42.224
- Major.
- Yeah.

49:43.392 --> 49:46.103
You in a hurry?
You might want to throttle back.

49:47.437 --> 49:48.647
Yeah, no, I was...

49:49.398 --> 49:50.732
Yeah, I don't know.

49:58.949 --> 50:00.075
Listen, Major...

50:02.953 --> 50:04.287
I'm a vet.

50:12.129 --> 50:13.797
I'll let it slide this one time.

50:15.340 --> 50:16.967
Come on, I'll get you home safe.

50:28.437 --> 50:30.856
Hey, Jesse, what are you doing awake?

50:30.939 --> 50:32.190
I'm thinking.

50:32.983 --> 50:34.317
Well, what you thinking about?

50:34.734 --> 50:37.362
- Everything.
- Well, that's a lot to be thinking about.

50:37.487 --> 50:39.823
Why don't you try
just thinking about sleeping?

50:39.906 --> 50:41.658
I'll do that.

50:41.741 --> 50:43.160
Good night, Daddy.

51:27.537 --> 51:29.539
We made the papers again.

51:32.459 --> 51:36.087
Ever notice when they burn Old Glory,
their flags are always homemade?

51:36.713 --> 51:38.994
For some reason, they don't stock
the Star-Spangled Banner

51:39.049 --> 51:40.967
in those Pashtun bazaars. No.

51:42.093 --> 51:45.680
Somebody had to paint
these 50 stars and 13 bars by hand.

51:45.764 --> 51:46.924
They had to do it just right.

51:48.600 --> 51:52.020
So we definitely know it's us
that's got them so upset.

51:55.232 --> 51:58.360
Like some guy stayed up all night
making that symbol of

51:58.443 --> 52:01.071
evil American imperialism
just as good as he can.

52:03.740 --> 52:05.992
A lot of love went into that hate.

52:08.370 --> 52:10.163
I've never been to Yemen, sir.

52:12.040 --> 52:14.167
If I were you, I'd keep it that way.

52:22.133 --> 52:25.637
This is Johns. We're over
your requested position, Langley.

52:25.762 --> 52:29.015
These are the coordinates
for Al-Bayda province, South Yemen.

52:29.099 --> 52:31.351
<i>Good afternoon,
Lieutenant Colonel Johns.</i>

52:31.434 --> 52:34.271
Last time I checked, Langley,
we're not at war with Yemen.

52:35.897 --> 52:39.317
<i>While we respect state sovereignty
and the rule of law, Colonel,</i>

52:39.442 --> 52:42.028
<i>we're regrettably facing
a substate adversary</i>

52:42.112 --> 52:43.655
<i>who abides by no rules.</i>

52:44.155 --> 52:47.909
<i>Out of necessity, this war on terror
has become borderless.</i>

52:49.119 --> 52:52.080
<i>The target is the Al-Qaeda cell
gathered by the market.</i>

52:57.294 --> 52:58.420
We see the crowd.

53:03.466 --> 53:05.302
You want us to kill a crowd?

53:05.885 --> 53:09.514
<i>Al-Qaeda unsurprisingly,
tend to congregate with Al-Qaeda</i>

53:09.639 --> 53:11.474
<i>or associated forces.</i>

53:12.475 --> 53:16.271
<i>Consequently, we've determined
that it is militarily more effective</i>

53:16.354 --> 53:19.107
<i>to eliminate a group than an individual.</i>

53:31.411 --> 53:33.246
Does that include the underage boy, sir?

53:33.330 --> 53:37.167
<i>Our analysts see only
military age males.</i>

53:37.250 --> 53:42.505
<i>In our assessment, this Al-Qaeda cell
represents an imminent threat.</i>

53:44.341 --> 53:46.384
<i>Permission to prosecute.</i>

53:46.760 --> 53:48.303
<i>Please cease recording.</i>

54:00.690 --> 54:03.652
- Laser.
- Lasing.

54:03.735 --> 54:06.863
Master arm on, weapon's hot.

54:08.323 --> 54:11.201
Three, two, one...

54:12.202 --> 54:13.662
Rifle.

54:14.746 --> 54:17.290
Missiles away. Time of flight,

54:18.249 --> 54:19.626
ten seconds.

54:36.559 --> 54:38.395
Like fish in a fucking barrel.

54:39.521 --> 54:43.483
<i>It is a sad fact that
war is often asymmetrical.</i>

54:44.025 --> 54:47.404
<i>Please forego damage assessment
and exit the airspace.</i>

54:54.411 --> 54:56.705
Master arm off, weapon's safe.

54:56.913 --> 54:58.123
Laser's safe.

55:09.342 --> 55:12.220
"Imminent threat"? They couldn't live
any further away from us.

55:13.012 --> 55:15.932
- Poorest fucking place on earth.
- Setting the course for Djibouti.

55:16.266 --> 55:18.101
It depends on
your definition of imminent.

55:20.311 --> 55:22.105
Actually, you're right about that.

55:23.064 --> 55:24.190
- I am?
- Yeah.

55:24.274 --> 55:27.193
Take a while for that boy to get big
enough to hold a Kalashnikov.

55:27.277 --> 55:30.822
But no question, we are a regular
fucking terrorist factory.

55:31.114 --> 55:33.616
Best recruitment tool
Al-Qaeda ever had.

55:33.700 --> 55:35.540
We can kill them faster
than they can make 'em.

55:35.618 --> 55:37.899
Fuck you, Zimmer.
You'd better pray they never get drones.

55:37.954 --> 55:39.514
They're not gonna
waste money on a drone

55:39.539 --> 55:41.708
when they can strap a bomb to a kid.

55:41.791 --> 55:44.210
Did you know the Times Square bomber
was trained in Yemen?

55:44.294 --> 55:46.379
Not very well. It didn't go off.

55:46.463 --> 55:47.505
Asshole.

55:47.797 --> 55:51.217
The reason he tried to blow us up

55:51.301 --> 55:52.886
was drone strikes.

55:52.969 --> 55:56.097
So obviously we should keep on
hitting them with drone strikes, right?

55:56.765 --> 55:57.807
Yes.

56:02.103 --> 56:03.855
Prepare to hand off.

56:13.865 --> 56:15.033
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Zack.

56:22.999 --> 56:24.834
Major, we got a customer.

56:25.752 --> 56:29.005
- You're the only available crew.
- What is it?

56:29.714 --> 56:31.841
Overwatch. One-Six.

57:00.578 --> 57:02.956
Warhorse Six, this is Deadly Four-One.

57:04.040 --> 57:05.792
<i>Deadly Four-One,</i>

57:05.875 --> 57:08.962
<i>my men need some shuteye.
Can you watch our backs?</i>

57:09.045 --> 57:13.383
<i>Make sure we don't get
any uninvited guests till 0600?</i>

57:14.384 --> 57:16.052
That's an affirmative, Warhorse Six.

57:16.928 --> 57:19.556
I got fuel for six hours.

57:21.558 --> 57:23.351
There's nothing close to your position.

57:24.978 --> 57:27.397
<i>Roger that. Nice to hear.</i>

57:29.232 --> 57:30.400
Sleep tight.

57:33.653 --> 57:35.363
<i>Copy. Out.</i>

58:36.299 --> 58:37.508
Warhorse Six...

58:41.095 --> 58:43.139
This is Deadly Four-One.

58:44.724 --> 58:46.935
And this is your wake up call.

58:51.147 --> 58:54.859
<i>Roger that, Deadly Four-One.
We owe you.</i>

59:14.837 --> 59:16.506
Your appointment today...

59:18.716 --> 59:20.510
Was it life or death?

59:22.512 --> 59:24.180
Because mine was.

59:27.016 --> 59:28.351
That's cheap.

59:31.688 --> 59:33.189
You're right.

59:36.025 --> 59:37.527
I'm sorry.

59:40.697 --> 59:42.323
What was your appointment?

59:42.407 --> 59:45.868
If you must know,
I was going to go to a class at the gym.

59:46.494 --> 59:49.122
I was trying to stay in shape
in case I go back to dancing.

59:50.123 --> 59:51.708
Chorus like we talked about.

59:54.043 --> 59:55.712
I blew 50 bucks not going.

59:56.379 --> 59:59.007
I'm sorry.
I'll try to make soccer tomorrow.

59:59.549 --> 01:00:01.426
I will, Molly.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.807
I did something good today.

01:00:10.143 --> 01:00:11.811
You don't always?

01:00:15.273 --> 01:00:17.400
Let me make it up to you.

01:00:48.222 --> 01:00:49.682
Prepare to hand off.

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.300
There's a man in Langley
who wants to borrow your plane.

01:00:54.479 --> 01:00:55.772
Handing off.

01:00:59.442 --> 01:01:03.362
Must be nice, Egan.
Hand-picked by the spooks,

01:01:03.446 --> 01:01:04.530
getting all the plum assignments.

01:01:04.614 --> 01:01:06.115
Is that what they are?

01:01:06.449 --> 01:01:09.869
Better than circling that compound like
some two-bit detective on a stakeout.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.748
- What's going on there?
- Nothing. That's the point.

01:01:13.831 --> 01:01:16.292
No, no, no. Right there. There.

01:01:17.668 --> 01:01:18.836
Same guy.

01:01:20.171 --> 01:01:21.255
Yup.

01:01:45.947 --> 01:01:47.281
He's a bad guy.

01:01:48.616 --> 01:01:50.660
He's just not our bad guy.

01:02:03.256 --> 01:02:04.674
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:02:13.891 --> 01:02:15.685
What's she doing now?

01:02:17.854 --> 01:02:19.522
She's going back to work.

01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:30.616
Major, we got new co-ords
from Langley.

01:02:31.617 --> 01:02:33.077
Sending them to you now.

01:02:38.332 --> 01:02:40.877
You ever seen
how beautiful it is in Virginia?

01:02:41.711 --> 01:02:44.297
It's green. It's not like here.

01:02:45.965 --> 01:02:50.052
You want to start a family,
crime in Virginia is non-existent.

01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:53.723
It's like heaven on earth.

01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:19.332
Hey.

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.425
You want to go somewhere today

01:03:29.508 --> 01:03:31.886
- and do something?
- Yeah?

01:03:33.763 --> 01:03:35.056
It's strange.

01:03:36.515 --> 01:03:39.352
Imagine growing up
praying for gray skies.

01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:42.772
They hate blue skies
'cause that's when we fly.

01:03:43.481 --> 01:03:44.815
Gray skies, maybe not.

01:03:48.444 --> 01:03:49.779
Let's do something.

01:03:51.197 --> 01:03:52.615
Go to the strip...

01:03:54.116 --> 01:03:55.284
Or dancing?

01:04:07.129 --> 01:04:08.464
Splash.

01:04:10.174 --> 01:04:11.509
No, he's getting away.

01:04:24.438 --> 01:04:26.399
- Grenades.
- Withhold ordnance.

01:04:26.482 --> 01:04:28.693
They're not grenades,
Intelligence Coordinator Zimmer.

01:04:28.776 --> 01:04:30.152
They're fucking pomegranates.

01:04:33.447 --> 01:04:35.700
<i>Thanks for the cover, Cyclops 8.</i>

01:04:35.783 --> 01:04:37.493
<i>How's the weather in Vegas?</i>

01:04:37.576 --> 01:04:39.954
Hotter than hell here, Bronco Two.

01:04:40.037 --> 01:04:41.831
<i>Happy to trade places.</i>

01:04:45.543 --> 01:04:47.670
Shit! Shit, what was that?

01:04:47.837 --> 01:04:50.131
LED. He stepped on an IED.

01:04:50.214 --> 01:04:52.633
Shoot back! Shoot something.

01:06:09.752 --> 01:06:12.421
<i>Hey, it's Molly. I'm not here.
Have a great day.</i>

01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:15.091
Molly, call me back.

01:06:30.022 --> 01:06:32.191
He's using the fertilizer to grow things.

01:06:32.274 --> 01:06:35.403
The question is,
does he use it to kill things?

01:06:35.486 --> 01:06:38.781
And this is not
your usual Afghani cash crop.

01:06:39.448 --> 01:06:41.117
He's actually growing something to eat.

01:06:42.451 --> 01:06:44.537
<i>The traffic to and from the structure</i>

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.956
<i>indicates to us the presence
of a bomb factory.</i>

01:06:48.916 --> 01:06:50.167
<i>In our judgment,</i>

01:06:50.251 --> 01:06:52.211
<i>the greater risk is to do nothing.</i>

01:06:54.255 --> 01:06:55.423
Roger that, Langley.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.968
Major.

01:07:03.139 --> 01:07:04.223
Major.

01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:10.563
- Yeah, laser on.
- It's lased, Major.

01:07:11.188 --> 01:07:13.983
Master arm on, weapon's hot.

01:07:14.191 --> 01:07:17.611
Three, two, one, rifle.

01:07:18.779 --> 01:07:21.407
Missile's away.
Time of flight, 10 seconds.

01:07:35.838 --> 01:07:37.131
Good kill.

01:07:47.516 --> 01:07:48.559
Hi.

01:07:50.936 --> 01:07:53.481
- I told you not to wait up.
- You drunk?

01:07:54.857 --> 01:07:56.233
That's rich coming from you.

01:07:56.317 --> 01:07:57.526
Where you been?

01:07:59.278 --> 01:08:01.489
I told you I was going out with the girls.

01:08:02.239 --> 01:08:03.657
What's wrong with you?

01:08:09.747 --> 01:08:12.166
Don't treat me like a damn fool.

01:08:13.542 --> 01:08:15.044
I saw you today...

01:08:16.837 --> 01:08:18.964
...in the truck with Danny.

01:08:19.048 --> 01:08:21.300
He was trying to work out
what's wrong with the truck.

01:08:23.051 --> 01:08:24.261
Because you never did.

01:08:26.639 --> 01:08:29.099
Plus I thought
it might be fun to blow him.

01:08:34.063 --> 01:08:35.689
I left you a message.

01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:38.274
My phone died.

01:08:39.484 --> 01:08:40.903
I just got your messages.

01:08:41.529 --> 01:08:43.906
- Let me see your phone.
- No.

01:08:50.328 --> 01:08:51.622
Give me your phone.

01:09:02.383 --> 01:09:03.841
Why'd you change your password?

01:09:05.678 --> 01:09:07.513
Because the kids know it

01:09:07.595 --> 01:09:09.430
and they're always
fucking with my phone.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.684
Give me the new password.

01:09:12.685 --> 01:09:14.144
It's Tommy.

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:16.854
Tommy.

01:09:24.904 --> 01:09:26.198
But I'll change that now.

01:09:32.453 --> 01:09:34.038
You think I'm having an affair.

01:09:38.042 --> 01:09:39.295
You know, I...

01:09:39.837 --> 01:09:41.630
I've thought about it.

01:09:43.131 --> 01:09:46.385
And you know what else,
I don't think it would even be cheating.

01:09:46.468 --> 01:09:49.013
Because to cheat on someone,
you'd have to be in a relationship.

01:09:50.305 --> 01:09:52.057
And I don't know that we are anymore.

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:53.642
If that's what helps you.

01:09:54.643 --> 01:09:55.978
Bet that helps.

01:09:58.022 --> 01:09:59.607
What is this about?

01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:02.250
I mean, is this really just about you
losing a seat in the plane?

01:10:04.612 --> 01:10:06.905
'Cause here's your last piece
of truth for the day.

01:10:07.281 --> 01:10:09.700
Nobody is gonna put you back in one.

01:10:14.121 --> 01:10:16.165
But I wasn't the one
that drug you out of the fucking thing,

01:10:16.248 --> 01:10:18.167
so taking it out on me
isn't going to help.

01:10:20.419 --> 01:10:21.920
And you were right about one thing.

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:23.839
Yeah, what's that?

01:10:24.214 --> 01:10:26.884
At least when you were away,
you were really away.

01:10:26.967 --> 01:10:29.178
Now you're here, but fuck it.

01:10:31.013 --> 01:10:32.348
But what?

01:10:33.057 --> 01:10:36.685
What is it that you need so bad?
What is it that you miss so bad?

01:10:37.353 --> 01:10:39.897
Combat? You miss the fucking combat?

01:10:40.397 --> 01:10:42.983
Hit me. Hit me, you like that.

01:10:43.067 --> 01:10:45.736
- I hit you one time. Will you stop?
- Come on, you little bitch! Hit me.

01:10:45.819 --> 01:10:47.488
- Hit me, little bitch, hit me!
- Molly, don't do that!

01:10:47.571 --> 01:10:49.907
- Hit me!
- Molly. Molly! Just stop it, all right.

01:10:50.866 --> 01:10:54.703
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:10:57.748 --> 01:10:58.916
It's okay.

01:11:01.251 --> 01:11:02.378
Fuck!

01:13:05.501 --> 01:13:07.461
<i>Langley, signing Off-</i>

01:13:53.841 --> 01:13:55.050
Seriously, dude...

01:13:56.343 --> 01:13:59.221
It's not like a costume you rent
when you wanna get lucky or...

01:15:05.621 --> 01:15:06.788
Hey.

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:09.291
Hey.

01:15:18.967 --> 01:15:20.302
You look miles away.

01:15:22.346 --> 01:15:23.555
Seven thousand.

01:15:28.727 --> 01:15:30.854
You wanna know about my job?

01:15:32.481 --> 01:15:33.565
Yeah.

01:15:34.399 --> 01:15:35.609
Well...

01:15:37.486 --> 01:15:41.865
Yesterday, I was flying over a house
in South Waziristan.

01:15:45.118 --> 01:15:46.787
It was night when I started watching

01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:49.122
but they couldn't see me
even if it was day.

01:15:52.501 --> 01:15:54.836
It was the house of
a Taliban commander.

01:15:56.338 --> 01:15:57.589
He wasn't home.

01:15:59.132 --> 01:16:02.094
Inside his wife and family were sleeping.

01:16:02.511 --> 01:16:06.515
When he did come back around dawn,
the family was still inside,

01:16:06.598 --> 01:16:09.476
but I wasn't sure
when I'd get this chance again so...

01:16:10.811 --> 01:16:12.813
I blew the house up anyway.

01:16:21.196 --> 01:16:22.239
And I watched

01:16:24.116 --> 01:16:26.868
as the neighbors started
pulling the bodies out.

01:16:30.706 --> 01:16:33.834
Another one of my jobs
is damage assessment,

01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:37.129
which is our way of saying
counting the dead,

01:16:37.212 --> 01:16:40.048
which is not as easy as it sounds.

01:16:41.174 --> 01:16:44.344
Because a lot of times the bodies
are in such small pieces.

01:16:45.887 --> 01:16:49.182
But this time, I knew for sure

01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:51.727
it was seven.

01:16:53.395 --> 01:16:56.898
<i>I watched all morning
as these locals cleaned up the mess,</i>

01:16:57.941 --> 01:17:00.027
<i>got ready for the funeral.</i>

01:17:02.487 --> 01:17:05.032
<i>They like to bury their dead
within 24 hours.</i>

01:17:07.075 --> 01:17:10.787
Which is a happy coincidence for me

01:17:10.871 --> 01:17:13.373
because that's how long
I can stay in the air.

01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:17.252
I watched them

01:17:18.086 --> 01:17:21.339
carry the bodies
up a hill to the gravesite.

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:24.926
I had information
that the Taliban commander's brother

01:17:25.052 --> 01:17:26.720
<i>would attend the funeral.</i>

01:17:27.596 --> 01:17:30.599
<i>So, I waited</i>

01:17:31.725 --> 01:17:33.685
<i>till they were all there</i>

01:17:35.103 --> 01:17:36.480
saying their prayers.

01:17:44.279 --> 01:17:46.031
And then I blew them up, too.

01:18:13.225 --> 01:18:14.476
That's my job.

01:19:27.382 --> 01:19:28.633
Come inside.

01:19:30.385 --> 01:19:32.095
I need you to come inside.

01:19:34.472 --> 01:19:35.891
Get back in the house.

01:19:38.727 --> 01:19:41.563
It's so beautifully clear
when we watch them.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.066
It couldn't be clearer if I was there.

01:19:47.611 --> 01:19:51.531
You can see everything,
the looks on their faces, everything.

01:19:53.742 --> 01:19:55.243
Tommy, please.

01:19:58.747 --> 01:20:00.415
Once you see it,

01:20:01.541 --> 01:20:03.001
how do you unsee it?

01:20:06.755 --> 01:20:08.173
You call in sick.

01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:10.091
You need help.

01:20:10.508 --> 01:20:12.260
You shouldn't be driving a car,
let alone...

01:20:12.344 --> 01:20:14.012
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:20:14.596 --> 01:20:16.806
- No, you can't go!
- I'm okay.

01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:18.558
No!

01:21:09.317 --> 01:21:11.611
- Cutting it close.
- Yeah, well, I made it, didn't I?

01:21:13.405 --> 01:21:15.573
- Need some gum, sir?
- No.

01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:21.496
No, you need some gum, sir.

01:21:31.172 --> 01:21:34.467
- Starting early. You okay?
- Yeah.

01:21:34.676 --> 01:21:35.969
Christie can cover for you.

01:21:39.097 --> 01:21:40.307
I'm fine.

01:21:45.812 --> 01:21:48.148
It's all right. Relax. Sit down.

01:21:52.986 --> 01:21:54.696
I know what you're all thinking.

01:21:56.197 --> 01:21:57.782
After what's gone on...

01:21:59.576 --> 01:22:02.662
I've been doing a little thinking myself,
believe it or not.

01:22:04.247 --> 01:22:06.958
And not too many of us are in love
with the tactics

01:22:07.042 --> 01:22:09.878
employed by our esteemed colleagues
in Langley, Virginia,

01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:11.588
but let me ask you all a question.

01:22:13.715 --> 01:22:16.468
They kill us and we kill them.

01:22:17.677 --> 01:22:20.972
I mean, does anybody here think
for a solitary second

01:22:21.306 --> 01:22:24.309
that if we stop killing them,
they're gonna stop killing us?

01:22:26.561 --> 01:22:29.898
It's a vicious cycle,
it doesn't matter who made it vicious.

01:22:31.066 --> 01:22:32.942
But they aren't gonna stop,

01:22:33.902 --> 01:22:35.236
so we can't.

01:22:36.237 --> 01:22:40.492
And that's why I'm gonna sit over
Afghanistan and Pakistan,

01:22:40.575 --> 01:22:43.453
Yemen, Somalia,
Sacramento-fucking-California,

01:22:44.245 --> 01:22:47.290
every day of what's left
of my sorry career

01:22:47.374 --> 01:22:50.085
if it saves one innocent American life.

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.962
'Cause I got no idea in hell

01:22:54.923 --> 01:22:58.468
how to explain to some grieving parents
their son or daughter is dead

01:22:58.551 --> 01:23:01.137
because we thought
enough was enough.

01:23:01.596 --> 01:23:03.807
We declared victory and went home.

01:23:05.225 --> 01:23:07.227
It never ends,

01:23:08.019 --> 01:23:09.229
sir.

01:23:31.334 --> 01:23:33.086
<i>Prepare for a follow-up.</i>

01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:55.775
What would you like us to hit, sir?

01:24:03.658 --> 01:24:05.076
<i>Why aren't they responding?</i>

01:24:07.245 --> 01:24:12.375
Could it be perhaps that they think
you're gonna hit them again, Langley?

01:24:15.462 --> 01:24:18.214
What is it you'd like us to do, Langley?

01:24:18.798 --> 01:24:21.718
<i>If they can wait, so can we.</i>

01:24:22.302 --> 01:24:24.095
<i>What's our loiter time?</i>

01:24:25.805 --> 01:24:26.931
Eight hours.

01:24:27.849 --> 01:24:29.267
<i>Then we wait.</i>

01:24:52.165 --> 01:24:54.626
All this circling's
making me dizzy, Major.

01:24:56.294 --> 01:24:58.129
Can you at least go the other way?

01:25:03.051 --> 01:25:04.886
A vehicle approaching from the west.

01:25:05.386 --> 01:25:07.639
<i>We are identifying the target.</i>

01:25:11.434 --> 01:25:14.270
<i>Positive ID. Target qualifies.</i>

01:25:14.395 --> 01:25:15.897
<i>Permission to prosecute.</i>

01:25:20.235 --> 01:25:22.153
Should I bother pointing out
the non-combatants

01:25:22.237 --> 01:25:23.363
in the impact zone, sir?

01:25:24.656 --> 01:25:28.743
Or should I assume that
all collateral damage is proportionate?

01:25:29.369 --> 01:25:30.745
<i>Engage immediately.</i>

01:25:34.916 --> 01:25:35.917
<i>Laser.</i>

01:25:38.461 --> 01:25:39.671
<i>Laser.</i>

01:25:43.967 --> 01:25:45.051
Airman.

01:25:47.428 --> 01:25:48.638
Lasing.

01:25:49.847 --> 01:25:53.142
Master arm on, weapon's hot.

01:25:54.769 --> 01:25:56.771
Three, two...

01:26:01.067 --> 01:26:03.069
I've lost the link, sir.

01:26:03.152 --> 01:26:04.445
Yeah, I've lost the link.

01:26:05.613 --> 01:26:07.657
<i>Get it back. Reacquire.</i>

01:26:08.366 --> 01:26:10.118
Reaper in default setting.

01:26:10.743 --> 01:26:11.783
Automatic holding pattern.

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.663
Attempting to reacquire now.

01:26:19.794 --> 01:26:21.588
Link re-established.

01:26:24.465 --> 01:26:27.093
- Shit.
- They've gotten away.

01:26:27.218 --> 01:26:29.262
<i>Locate the target. Find them.</i>

01:26:32.307 --> 01:26:34.058
<i>There. Strike the truck.</i>

01:26:34.142 --> 01:26:35.560
Yes, sir. Which one?

01:26:35.643 --> 01:26:36.894
<i>Hit the truck!</i>

01:26:37.395 --> 01:26:40.315
- Which <i>one, Langley?
- Jesus Christ!</i>

01:26:41.983 --> 01:26:43.735
Which truck, sir?

01:26:47.614 --> 01:26:48.990
Langley, which one?

01:26:49.699 --> 01:26:50.992
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:26:53.411 --> 01:26:54.787
Which one, sir?

01:26:56.247 --> 01:26:57.498
Which one?

01:27:01.961 --> 01:27:03.880
Captain Christie, take the controls.

01:27:10.803 --> 01:27:11.888
Major.

01:27:14.349 --> 01:27:15.391
Major.

01:27:28.363 --> 01:27:30.448
You deliberately dropped the link, Major.

01:27:30.698 --> 01:27:33.201
And last time I checked,
that's Article 92.

01:27:33.785 --> 01:27:35.578
Failure to comply with a lawful order.

01:27:37.246 --> 01:27:39.916
- And orders...
- Are orders.

01:27:47.215 --> 01:27:49.050
I gotta do something, Tommy.

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:52.845
You tied my hands.

01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:58.559
If I don't do something,
the IT spooks will crawl up the ass

01:27:58.643 --> 01:28:01.562
of your console to work out
what we both know you did.

01:28:02.313 --> 01:28:04.482
And they'll come down on you
a fuck sight harder.

01:28:05.191 --> 01:28:06.192
I gotta do something.

01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:10.738
They're never gonna let it go.

01:28:17.328 --> 01:28:20.748
I guess this is a bad time to bring up
getting me back in a plane.

01:28:49.318 --> 01:28:50.737
Hey, Molly.

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.364
Hi.

01:28:54.365 --> 01:28:55.783
<i>You know that promotion?</i>

01:28:58.035 --> 01:28:59.620
It got rescinded.

01:29:00.955 --> 01:29:03.249
<i>I've been downgraded to surveillance.</i>

01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:06.210
<i>- What'd you do?
- More like what I didn't do.</i>

01:29:07.962 --> 01:29:09.964
I'm never gonna fly again.

01:29:11.424 --> 01:29:12.800
I'm sorry.

01:29:13.176 --> 01:29:14.635
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

01:29:15.303 --> 01:29:18.139
<i>Look, this morning, how I left today...</i>

01:29:18.222 --> 01:29:19.640
<i>- Tom my.
- Please, Molly.</i>

01:29:19.724 --> 01:29:22.435
Tommy, I have something
I have to tell you.

01:29:22.518 --> 01:29:25.396
<i>Please, Molly. Listen to me.</i>

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.231
<i>Give me a chance, all right?
I wanna make this up...</i>

01:29:27.315 --> 01:29:30.151
I'm taking the kids
to my sister's in Reno.

01:29:32.195 --> 01:29:33.863
When will you be back?

01:29:35.907 --> 01:29:37.366
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:29:40.077 --> 01:29:41.412
You're leaving me?

01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:47.210
You left me first.

01:29:48.795 --> 01:29:50.338
Molly, please.

01:29:50.505 --> 01:29:53.007
I'm so sorry, Tommy. I've got to go.

01:30:55.194 --> 01:30:57.405
Now I assume you know
we don't fly them

01:30:57.488 --> 01:30:59.907
all the way there from here in Vegas,

01:31:00.533 --> 01:31:01.617
but I guess I shouldn't assume anything.

01:31:01.701 --> 01:31:03.744
I got food in my fridge
older than most of you.

01:31:05.079 --> 01:31:08.124
Now, all take-offs and landings occur

01:31:08.207 --> 01:31:10.209
in and around
whatever godforsaken place

01:31:10.293 --> 01:31:11.627
we're at war with that day.

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:28.144
- You can't smoke here.
- Yeah, I know.

01:31:36.611 --> 01:31:37.737
Sorry.

01:31:40.281 --> 01:31:41.574
I heard your wife moved out.

01:31:45.411 --> 01:31:47.872
Now they've stuck you
back on Kahili surveillance?

01:31:48.414 --> 01:31:49.790
It's not your week.

01:31:54.462 --> 01:31:55.963
I wanted to tell you

01:31:57.173 --> 01:31:58.633
what happened with you,

01:32:00.635 --> 01:32:02.053
I turned in my wings.

01:32:04.931 --> 01:32:09.644
Yeah, can't make the battlefields
and blackjack thing work after all.

01:32:17.485 --> 01:32:20.905
So I guess the order...

01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:25.660
You know, the one prohibiting officers
and enlisted from fraternizing...

01:32:27.411 --> 01:32:29.705
- Article 15.
- ...no longer applies.

01:32:43.761 --> 01:32:44.762
If you change your mind.

01:32:46.347 --> 01:32:49.433
The airman part's
a little misleading, but...

01:32:52.353 --> 01:32:56.357
Make no mistake, I am first class.

01:33:32.226 --> 01:33:33.519
Widen out.

01:33:39.025 --> 01:33:41.318
Yeah, there's nothing going on here.

01:33:42.236 --> 01:33:43.904
Why don't you two take a break.

01:33:45.489 --> 01:33:48.909
I sure could use a break.
Thank you, Major.

01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:51.203
Go on, Zim.

01:33:51.412 --> 01:33:53.080
You can tell her all about
how close you were

01:33:53.164 --> 01:33:56.083
to making that elite CT unit at Langley.

01:34:33.954 --> 01:34:36.082
We're not gonna record anything today.

01:34:40.628 --> 01:34:42.004
I got you.

01:34:45.716 --> 01:34:47.968
All right, let's get a little closer.

01:34:51.013 --> 01:34:52.723
Okay, there you are.

01:34:53.641 --> 01:34:54.850
Going hot.

01:34:59.605 --> 01:35:03.859
One Minnesota, two Minnesota...

01:35:05.778 --> 01:35:07.613
You stay there. Okay, that's fine.

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.949
That's fine. Just stay put.

01:35:10.741 --> 01:35:14.620
Three, two, one, rifle.

01:35:15.329 --> 01:35:16.956
Time of flight, 10 seconds.

01:35:19.875 --> 01:35:21.043
No, what are you doing?

01:35:21.752 --> 01:35:24.588
No, no, no, go back. Stay back.

01:35:24.672 --> 01:35:25.673
Get back...

01:35:41.522 --> 01:35:42.815
Oh, my God.

01:35:43.983 --> 01:35:46.986
Oh, please. Oh, please.

01:35:48.821 --> 01:35:50.948
Oh, please, please,
please, please, please,

01:35:51.031 --> 01:35:52.825
come on, come on, go...

01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:35.117
Master arm off, weapon's safe.

01:36:43.751 --> 01:36:45.044
Major Egan?

01:36:57.514 --> 01:36:58.724
Egan.

01:37:02.561 --> 01:37:03.729
Tommy.
