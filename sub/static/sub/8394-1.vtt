WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:01.949
- BOBBY LITI'LE.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.399
YEAH, HE'S RUNNING
FOR CITY COUNCIL,

00:03.450 --> 00:05.759
AND HE ACTUALLY CALLED ME
TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN.

00:05.790 --> 00:06.893
WHAT IS GOING ON
RIGHT NOW?

00:06.930 --> 00:09.069
- WE'RE TWO ADULTS HERE.
- I'M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED

00:09.110 --> 00:10.862
RIGHT NOW.
- YOU NEED TO TELL US

00:10.900 --> 00:13.767
THAT YOUR FOCUS
IS 100% ON YOUR CLIENTS.

00:13.800 --> 00:14.903
- I QUIT.

00:14.940 --> 00:17.249
THANK YOU FOR THESE LAST
NINE YEARS, LEON.

00:17.290 --> 00:20.282
- I'M GONNA MOVE TO MINNESOTA.
COME WITH ME.

00:20.330 --> 00:22.082

KRISTINA.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.042
ENJOY YOURSELF.

00:26.610 --> 00:27.599

00:28.750 --> 00:30.331
- I HEARD FROM BERKELEY.

00:30.370 --> 00:31.917
I GOT IN.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.985
- WE'RE HAVING A BABY.
- NO!

00:34.030 --> 00:35.258
YOU'RE PREGNANT
RIGHT NOW?

00:35.310 --> 00:37.642
- HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

00:37.690 --> 00:39.442
- WHAT ABOUT CHLOE?
THAT'S A CUTE NAME.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.449
- NO, NO, CHLOE FREEMAN--
SHE WAS A SENIOR,

00:42.490 --> 00:44.958
AND I WAS A SOPHOMORE,
AND SHE WAS...

00:45.010 --> 00:46.796
LET'S JUST SAY IT GOT WEIRD,
REAL WEIRD.

00:46.830 --> 00:49.458
SHE WAS A FREAK.
- [laughs]

00:49.490 --> 00:51.310
- BAD MEMORIES. YEAH.
- OKAY, OKAY.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.349
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE ME
A LIST OF NAMES

00:52.390 --> 00:54.449
YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT WITH,
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,

00:54.500 --> 00:55.489
WE COULD NARROW IT DOWN
FROM THERE.

00:55.530 --> 00:57.907
- OH, THAT'S FUNNY.
WHAT ABOUT THE LAST NAM E?

00:57.950 --> 00:59.178
WHERE YOU AT WITH THAT?

00:59.230 --> 01:01.949
- I THOUGHT WE ALREADY DECIDED
ON, UM, TRUSSELL-BRAVERMAN.

01:01.990 --> 01:04.129
- NO, YOU HAD SAID
"BRAVERMAN-TRUSSELL,"

01:04.160 --> 01:06.219
WHICH SEEMS TO ME LIKE,
YOU KNOW...

01:06.270 --> 01:07.089
- [exhales deeply]

01:07.130 --> 01:08.290
- I DON'T EVEN THINK
THAT'S LEGAL.

01:08.340 --> 01:11.332
BRAVERMAN'S GOT A RING TO IT,
JUST STRAIGHT BRAVERMAN--

01:11.380 --> 01:14.543
NO HYPHEN, JUST--
MM, REAL SOLID.

01:14.590 --> 01:15.409
- YEAH.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.997
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE
FOR YOUR CAR?

01:17.040 --> 01:18.792
THIS IS CUTE.
- NO, HONEY, THAT'S PINK.

01:18.830 --> 01:21.344
I DON'T WANT A PINK ONE.
THERE'S A RED ONE AND BLACK ONE.

01:21.390 --> 01:23.176
- YEAH, BUT IT'S GOT
A FIVE-POINT HARNESS,

01:23.220 --> 01:25.176
AND IT'S ON SALE.
- IT'S ON SALE 'CAUSE IT'S PINK.

01:25.220 --> 01:27.279
NO MAN WANTS TO DRIVE AROUND
WITH A PINK SEAT.

01:27.320 --> 01:27.877
WHAT'S GOING ON.
- OH!

01:27.910 --> 01:30.947
[grunts]
- YOU OKAY?

01:30.980 --> 01:33.016
- I THINK THIS MIGHT BE IT.

01:33.050 --> 01:35.359
- NO, NO, HONEY, NO.
YOU'RE THREE WEEKS AWAY.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.981
THAT'S NOT--NO.
IT'S PROBABLY A BRAXTON HICKS.

01:37.020 --> 01:37.918
IT'S A BRAXTON HICKS.
- NO.

01:37.950 --> 01:39.338
- WE'LL JUST WAIT.

01:39.370 --> 01:40.712
- NO, NO, IT'S DEFINITELY NOT
A BRAXTON HICKS.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.889
- HONEY, IT'S THREE WEEKS AWAY.
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THIS IS IT.

01:42.930 --> 01:44.477
WE DON'T HAVE A NAME.
WE DON'T HAVE A CAR SEAT.

01:44.510 --> 01:45.818
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE DIAPERS
OR WIPES.

01:45.860 --> 01:48.715
I DIDN'T FINISH WHAT TO EXPECT
WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.728
- HONEY, WE NEED TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?

01:50.760 --> 01:52.933
- WELL, THEN I NEED TO AT LEAST
GRAB, UM, A MONITOR

01:52.970 --> 01:54.585
SO WE CAN HEAR
THE BABY CRYING.

01:54.630 --> 01:55.551
- CROSBY--
- AND THEN ONESIE--

01:55.590 --> 01:57.034
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DRESS HER IN?
- CROSBY!

01:57.080 --> 01:58.411
- WHAT?

01:58.460 --> 02:01.247
- I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
MY BABY HERE, OKAY?

02:01.290 --> 02:02.450
LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.047
OKAY.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.014

[doorbell rings]

02:07.090 --> 02:09.149
[knocking at door]

02:11.780 --> 02:14.294
[sighs]

02:16.300 --> 02:17.437
HI.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.641

02:19.690 --> 02:22.989

02:23.030 --> 02:23.826

02:28.320 --> 02:30.174
I MEAN, HEY, I DID
THE RESPONSIBLE THING.

02:30.210 --> 02:31.108
- YOU DID.
GOOD JOB.

02:31.150 --> 02:33.459
MAYBE LEAVE ONE
UNDER THE MAT NEXT TIME.

02:33.490 --> 02:34.969
- OKAY.
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

02:35.010 --> 02:37.114

02:47.400 --> 02:49.539
- ARE THESE YOUR DOGS?
- NO, THEY'RE NOT.

02:49.580 --> 02:50.979
THEY'RE
SOMEBODY ELSE'S DOGS.

02:53.310 --> 02:53.924
THANK YOU. OKAY.
- YOU'RE A PHOTOGRAPHER OF DOGS?

02:53.960 --> 02:55.609

02:55.650 --> 02:57.959
THAT'S AWESOME.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.275
OKAY, NIGHT-NIGHT.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.277
HAS THOSE PAJAMAS.
- OH, THAT'S NICE.

03:01.310 --> 03:03.107
HER MOM HAS THEM, CARL.
- NO, SHE DOESN'T.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.380
LINCOLN, COME ON.
- OKAY, GOOD NIGHT.

03:04.420 --> 03:05.523
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.868

03:06.910 --> 03:09.049
ARE YOU MAD, SUPER LADY?
- NO, NO, NOT MAD.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.310
JUST TIRED.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.669
[background chatter]

03:13.710 --> 03:15.530
- [laughing]
PEOPLE ARE STARING AT US.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.390
- ARE THEY?
I DON'T CARE.

03:17.430 --> 03:18.943
- WHOO!
- I DON'T CARE.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.914
[soul music playing]

03:24.300 --> 03:25.676
- THANK YOU.
[gasps] I HAVE AN IDEA.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.675
- YEAH.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.928
- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF I ASKED YOU

03:29.960 --> 03:32.372
TO GO SPEND THE NIGHT
WITH ME IN A CHEAP MOTEL?

03:32.410 --> 03:35.129
- WHAT BROUGHT THIS ON?

03:35.180 --> 03:37.648
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A GIFT, YOU KNOW?

03:37.700 --> 03:39.201
IT'S LIKE--
- OH, IT'S A GIFT.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.901

03:41.940 --> 03:44.500
I MEAN, LAST YEAR WE WENT

03:44.530 --> 03:46.521
AND I JUST WANT, YOU KNOW,

03:46.570 --> 03:49.141
LIKE WE WERE BEFORE AND...

03:55.020 --> 03:56.055
- ALL RIGHT.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.716
[phone ringing]

04:01.750 --> 04:02.956
[beep]

04:03.000 --> 04:04.228
- HEY, ADAM.

04:04.270 --> 04:06.158
- HEY.
- IT'S KIND OF LATE, YOU KNOW.

04:06.210 --> 04:07.893
I CHARGE EXTRA PAST MIDNIGHT.
- LISTEN...

04:07.930 --> 04:10.069
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO TAKE THE KIDS TONIGHT,

04:10.110 --> 04:11.554
HAVE THEM FOR A SLEEPOVER?

04:11.590 --> 04:12.579
WE'LL PICK 'EM UP
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

04:12.630 --> 04:14.894
- AHA! YOU'RE HEADING ON DOWN
TO FUNKYTOWN.

04:14.940 --> 04:16.555
- COULD YOU PLEASE NOT SAY
"FUNKYTOWN"?

04:16.600 --> 04:19.148
- THE BRAVERMAN TESTOSTERONE

04:19.180 --> 04:21.387
IS A POTENT
AND WONDERFUL THING.

04:21.430 --> 04:23.045
- YES, IT IS.
- GOT TO KEEP THAT FIRE

04:23.090 --> 04:24.114
IN THE LOINS, SON...

04:24.160 --> 04:25.320

04:25.360 --> 04:26.679
IT'S LIKE THE STONES.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.917

04:48.280 --> 04:51.625
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

04:51.670 --> 04:52.694
- WENT TO WORK YESTERDAY.

04:52.740 --> 04:55.049
- WENT TO WORK.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.321
- YEAH.
- I MEAN, ARE YOU...

04:57.360 --> 05:00.397
ARE YOU SAFE?

05:00.430 --> 05:02.489
- WE'RE NOT--WE'RE NOT
REALLY ALLOWED TO...

05:02.540 --> 05:03.871
- OH, YOU CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

05:03.920 --> 05:04.670
- RIGHT.

05:04.710 --> 05:07.986
- OKAY.

05:08.030 --> 05:09.952
UM...

05:12.030 --> 05:14.089
[sighs]
I MISS YOU SO MUCH.

05:14.140 --> 05:17.473
IT'S HARD.
- [grunts]

05:17.520 --> 05:18.612
- I LOVE YOU, AND...

05:18.660 --> 05:21.936
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

05:23.970 --> 05:25.380
RYAN .

05:25.940 --> 05:29.876
BABE, YOU'RE FROZEN.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.264
- OH, SHE'S SO--
LOOK AT HER.

06:15.300 --> 06:19.339
- SHE'S SO WHITE.
- OH, MY GOD.

06:19.370 --> 06:21.782
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

06:21.820 --> 06:24.653
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

06:24.690 --> 06:26.749
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

06:26.800 --> 06:29.371
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

06:29.420 --> 06:31.763
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

06:31.800 --> 06:34.143
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

06:34.180 --> 06:36.455
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:36.490 --> 06:38.833
FOREVER YOUNG

06:38.880 --> 06:40.700
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

06:40.740 --> 06:43.948
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:43.980 --> 06:46.494
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:46.540 --> 06:48.679
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:48.710 --> 06:51.474
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:51.510 --> 06:53.569
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:53.620 --> 06:55.542
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:55.580 --> 06:58.231
FOREVER YOUNG

06:58.270 --> 07:00.511
MAY YOU STAY

07:00.550 --> 07:03.792
FOREVER YOUNG

07:20.810 --> 07:21.674
- WHOA.

07:21.710 --> 07:23.530
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:23.580 --> 07:25.150
- THE CAMERA
THAT YOU GAVE ME BROKE.

07:25.200 --> 07:29.091
IS THERE A WARRANTY?
- UH, IT'S 45 YEARS OLD, SO...

07:29.130 --> 07:29.949
PROBABLY NOT.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.821
WHAT, UH...
HOW'D YOU GET HERE?

07:32.860 --> 07:34.782
- I WALKED.
YOU'RE IN MY RADIUS.

07:34.830 --> 07:35.899
- WHAT?

07:35.930 --> 07:37.511
- MY RADIUS.
MY PARENTS GAVE ME A RADIUS

07:37.560 --> 07:39.369
AROUND THE HOUSE WHERE I CAN
WALK TO ON MY OWN.

07:39.420 --> 07:41.695
THE IDEA
IS THAT I BUILD AUTONOMY

07:41.730 --> 07:43.243
SO THAT EVENTUALLY
I'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE OUT

07:43.290 --> 07:45.212
AND SUPPORT MYSELF.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.456
ALSO, EVENTUALLY
THEY'RE GONNA DIE,

07:46.500 --> 07:48.354
SO I'M GONNA NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO LIVE ON MY OWN ANYWAY.

07:48.390 --> 07:50.836
- HMM.
THAT'S TOUCHING.

07:50.880 --> 07:54.771
ALL RIGHT, I'LL LOOK AT THIS.
I'LL SEE WHAT YOU DID HERE.

07:54.810 --> 07:56.323
- WHY ARE YOU TAKING
A PHOTOGRAPH

07:56.370 --> 07:57.359
OF SOMETHING
THAT'S ALREADY A PICTURE?

07:57.400 --> 07:59.641
- THAT'S FOR A BROCHURE.
- THIS PAINTING SUCKS.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.853
WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT IT
IN A BROCHURE?

08:01.890 --> 08:03.334
- YEAH.
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S ART.

08:03.370 --> 08:05.099
I DON'T KNOW.

08:05.130 --> 08:07.758
- I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE
WITH THE LIGHTS.

08:07.790 --> 08:09.132
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WELL, WHEN YOU LIGHT IT

08:09.170 --> 08:11.991
FROM THE SIDE LIKE THIS,
IT'S STILL BRIGHT

08:12.040 --> 08:13.029
WITHOUT BEING SHINY
AND HAVING GLARE.

08:13.070 --> 08:16.005
BUT YOU ALSO GET TO SEE
THE BUMPS IN THE PAINT.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.179
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:18.220 --> 08:20.552
THAT'S--THAT'S TEXTURE.
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.352
- I'M REALLY SENSITIVE
TO LIGHT,

08:22.390 --> 08:26.042
WHICH SUCKS, BECAUSE I GET
HEADACHES IN THE SUN A LOT.

08:26.090 --> 08:28.911
I SHOULD WEAR A HAT, APPARENTLY,
BUT I DON'T LIKE HATS.

08:28.950 --> 08:31.601
HATS SUCK--THEY MAKE ME FEEL
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.779
- YEAH, I HEAR YOU.
- THE PHOTOS THAT I TOOK

08:33.820 --> 08:36.027
WITH THAT ARE A LOT BETTER
THAN THAT PAINTING.

08:37.790 --> 08:39.849
- TOOK SOME PHOTOS?
- MM-HMM.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.374
- THEY'RE ALL BUGS?
- YEAH, BUT KEEP GOING.

08:44.420 --> 08:47.446
THERE'S SOME
OF MY LIZARDS TOO.

08:47.490 --> 08:49.958
- THESE ARE PRETTY GOOD, MAX.

08:50.010 --> 08:52.626
YOU ACTUALLY GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF AN EYE THERE.

08:52.670 --> 08:55.002
YOU OUGHT TO DO PEOPLE.

08:55.050 --> 08:56.597
- PEOPLE BORE ME.

08:56.630 --> 08:58.632
- YEAH, I GET THAT.

08:58.670 --> 09:01.355
- WELL, IF MY AUNT SARAH
TAKES PICTURES OF DOGS AND CATS,

09:01.400 --> 09:03.186
WHY CAN'T I DO IT OF BUGS?

09:03.230 --> 09:04.561
- HOW IS AUNT SARAH?

09:04.610 --> 09:07.499
- SHE SAYS SHE'S A LOT BETTER
NOW THAT SHE BROKE UP WITH YOU.

09:07.540 --> 09:09.531
- OKAY. SHE DIDN'T SAY THAT,
AND IT WASN'T--

09:09.580 --> 09:11.059
- YEAH, SHE DID.
- NO. IT WAS MUTUAL, SO...

09:11.100 --> 09:12.431
- THAT'S NOT THE WAY
SHE TOLD IT.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.232
SHE SAID IT EXACTLY
LIKE THAT--

09:14.270 --> 09:15.999
SHE'S A LOT HAPPIER NOW
THAT SHE BROKE UP WITH YOU.

09:16.030 --> 09:17.338
- YEAH, SHE MAY HAVE...
- VERBATIM.

09:17.380 --> 09:19.109
- SAID IT THAT WAY, BUT THAT'S
WHAT SHE PROBABLY SAYS TO KIDS.

09:19.140 --> 09:20.550
BUT, UH...
- EVERYONE WAS IN THE ROOM--

09:20.590 --> 09:22.512
MY MOM AND DAD TOO.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.209
HERE, THE SHUTTER
WAS JAMMED ON THAT.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.148
- OKAY.

09:25.180 --> 09:26.408
- YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL
WITH THIS.

09:26.460 --> 09:28.314
- THANKS.
- THAT USED TO BE MY CAMERA,

09:28.360 --> 09:30.248
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID.

09:30.290 --> 09:32.144
AND NOT A BAD JOB EITHER.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.219
- BYE.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.948
- OH, MAX.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.683
YOU WANT TO STICK AROUND
AND LOOK AROUND,

09:49.720 --> 09:51.130
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

09:51.170 --> 09:52.751
I'M ABOUT TO SHOOT
SOME THREE-DIMENSIONAL CRAP

09:52.790 --> 09:54.655
IF YOU WANT TO SEE THAT.

09:57.180 --> 10:00.456
- DO YOU GOT ANY SNACKS?
- SNACKS. YEAH.

10:00.490 --> 10:03.527
I GOT CREAM SODA.
MIGHT BE FLAT, THOUGH.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.120
- THAT'S FINE.
I LIKE SODA WHEN IT'S FLAT.

10:06.150 --> 10:08.948
- ALL RIGHT.
- I'M JUST IN IT FOR THE SUGAR.

10:08.980 --> 10:10.424
- THAT'S MY MOTTO FOR LIFE--
"I'M JUST IN IT FOR THE SUGAR."

10:10.470 --> 10:12.495
- AND RIGHT ABOUT HERE...
- YEAH.

10:12.540 --> 10:15.987
- IS WHERE THE KITCHEN'S
GONNA BE, OKAY?

10:16.020 --> 10:17.908
A NICE LITTLE
CORNER CUPBOARD.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.575
RIGHT ABOUT HERE IS THE SLIDING
DOOR, OUT TO THE BACK PORCH,

10:19.610 --> 10:23.068
THE BACKYARD--
BOOM! LOOK AT THAT VIEW!

10:23.100 --> 10:24.021
[laughter]

10:24.070 --> 10:25.992
- AWESOME.
- IT'S REALLY NICE!

10:26.030 --> 10:27.850
- PRETTY AWESOME.
- IT'S REALLY NICE.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.447
- YEAH, IT GOES
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

10:29.490 --> 10:30.866
- WOW.
- THERE'S GONNA BE 26 HOUSES?

10:30.900 --> 10:31.753
- YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
- THAT'S LIKE

10:31.800 --> 10:33.347
A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD.
- PRACTICALLY.

10:33.390 --> 10:34.721
- CAN I COME TO YOUR
FIRST DAY OF BUILDING?

10:34.770 --> 10:35.998
- IF HE GETS THE JOB.
- OH.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.359
- CROSS YOUR FINGERS.
- YEAH.

10:37.390 --> 10:38.379
I'M STILL BIDDING
ON IT, BUDDY.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.499
- WHAT DOES BIDDING MEAN?
- WELL, THAT'S WHEN

10:39.530 --> 10:42.499
I PUT IN AN ESTIMATE
ON HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COST,

10:42.530 --> 10:43.428
THEN THEY TALK
TO OTHER BUILDERS

10:43.470 --> 10:46.189
ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY THINK
IT'S GONNA COST.

10:46.230 --> 10:49.017
AND IT USUALLY COMES DOWN
TO LOWEST PRICE WINS.

10:49.060 --> 10:50.391
- WHY DON'T YOU
JUST BID REALLY LOW?

10:50.440 --> 10:52.817
- THERE YOU GO.
- WELL, HE CAN'T BID TOO LOW.

10:52.850 --> 10:54.920
HE HAS TO PROTECT
HIS PROFIT MARGIN.

10:56.580 --> 10:58.571
- THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

10:58.620 --> 11:01.134
- WHO--WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT?

11:01.170 --> 11:02.478
- I KNOW BUSINESS.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.795
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU GOT TO PROTECT

11:04.830 --> 11:07.105
YOUR PROFIT MARGIN, BABE.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

11:07.140 --> 11:09.586
- BABE, YOU'RE GONNA GET IT.
- IT'S TWO YEARS' WORK.

11:09.630 --> 11:11.769
- WOW.
- YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR JOB.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.596
WE'LL BE LIKE THE ROCKEFELLERS.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.076
- WE'LL BE LIKE
THE ROCKEFELLERS!

11:16.150 --> 11:17.219
YEAH, IF I GET IT.
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT YET.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.353
- COMPANY'S BEEN TRYING
TO POACH YOU FOR YEARS.

11:19.400 --> 11:23.188
THEY'D BE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.
- YEAH, THEY WOULD.

11:23.230 --> 11:24.436
- YEAH--LISTEN TO YOU!
- NO, THEY W--[laughs]

11:24.470 --> 11:26.847
WELL, THEY WOULD!

11:26.890 --> 11:31.054
THEY'D BE LUCKY TO HAVE ME
AND MY HUMILITY OVER THERE.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.499
- IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD YEAR.
- IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT YEAR.

11:32.550 --> 11:35.519
[doorbell rings]
- THEY'RE DANCING.

11:35.550 --> 11:37.518
SAY, "DANCING, DANCING."
LA LA LA.

11:37.550 --> 11:38.926
LALALA.
-LALALA.

11:38.970 --> 11:40.517
- ADAM BRAVERMAN.
BOB LITTLE.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.039
- I KNOW.
- HOW ARE YOU?

11:42.080 --> 11:43.104
- GOOD.
- AM I GETTING HERE

11:43.150 --> 11:43.900
AT A BAD TIME?
- NO. COME ON IN.

11:43.940 --> 11:45.339
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU BET.

11:45.390 --> 11:46.937
YOU WANT TO TALK TO KRISTINA?
- I WOULD.

11:46.980 --> 11:47.799
- COME ON IN.
- TERRIFIC. THANK YOU.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.626
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- KRISTINA.

11:49.670 --> 11:52.878
- HELLO.
- HI. LOOK HOW BIG

11:52.910 --> 11:54.980
SHE HAS GOTTEN!
- I MIGHT TAKE OFFENSE TO THAT.

11:55.020 --> 11:55.702
- NO.
- I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT.

11:55.740 --> 11:58.391
- JEEZ LOUISE. HI!
- SAY HI.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.089
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW ARE YOU?

12:00.130 --> 12:01.358
- I AM GREAT.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12:01.410 --> 12:03.366
- NICE TO SEE YOU TOO.

12:03.410 --> 12:04.809
- HAVE A SEAT.
- THANK YOU.

12:04.860 --> 12:07.681
- IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.926
- LET'S GO READ A BOOK.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.348
COME HERE, HONEY.
- GO SEE DADDY!

12:10.380 --> 12:11.540
- LET'S TAKE YOUR BOOK.
OKAY, YEAH, LET'S GO IN HERE.

12:11.590 --> 12:13.376
- OH, MY GOODNESS!

12:13.420 --> 12:15.934
- YEAH, I KNOW.
SHE'S PRETTY AMAZING.

12:15.970 --> 12:17.278
- UM...
- SHE KEEPS ME GROUNDED.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.935
THAT'S FOR SURE.
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

12:18.970 --> 12:21.689
- I FEEL GOOD, YOU KNOW,
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT CURED.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.490
THEY DON'T REALLY SAY THAT
FOR FIVE YEARS,

12:22.530 --> 12:25.328
BUT TODAY, RIGHT NOW,
I'M GOOD.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.009
I'M CANCER-FREE.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.256
- HEAR, HEAR.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.915
- YEAH. KNOCK ON WOOD.

12:31.950 --> 12:34.259
- THAT IS SO GREAT.
I AM SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.642
- SO SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'RE NOT HERE

12:35.680 --> 12:37.363
JUST TO ASK ABOUT MY HEALTH.

12:37.410 --> 12:38.854
- KRISTINA.
- YES.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.050
- COME ON.
- WHAT?

12:40.100 --> 12:41.442
- MY FIRST PRIORITY
IS CERTAINLY YOUR HEALTH

12:41.480 --> 12:42.333
AND YOUR WELL-BEING.

12:42.380 --> 12:45.099
HOWEVER, UM...

12:45.140 --> 12:47.517
I'M NOT HERE TO ASK YOU
TO WORK FOR MY CAMPAIGN.

12:47.550 --> 12:49.347
- OKAY. YOU'RE NOT.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.586
THAT'S GOOD,
BECAUSE THE LAST ONE, WE...

12:50.630 --> 12:53.929
WE LOST.
- I'D LIKE YOU TO RUN IT.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.354
- OKAY, UM...

13:01.400 --> 13:02.287
THAT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU--
- KRISTINA...

13:02.330 --> 13:03.945
- I AM SO FLATTERED.
- I KNOW EDUCATION

13:03.990 --> 13:05.491
IS YOUR PASSION.
- IT IS.

13:05.540 --> 13:06.564
- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE CHANGES
THAT YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT.

13:06.610 --> 13:09.078
- THERE ARE, BUT...
- THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE

13:09.130 --> 13:09.812
TO AFFECT CHANGE
ON A MUNICIPAL LEVEL

13:09.850 --> 13:11.499
THAN FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.679
AND WHEN WE WIN,

13:13.720 --> 13:16.928
YOU ARE NOT JUST GONNA BE
MY ADVISOR,

13:16.960 --> 13:19.679
BUT THE EDUCATION
WILL BE YOUR DOMAIN.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.130
AND I PROMISE YOU,

13:21.170 --> 13:23.309
I WILL NOT HIT ON ANY
OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS...

13:23.350 --> 13:25.489
- [laughs]
- INCLUDING YOUR HUSBAND.

13:25.520 --> 13:26.726
- PLEASE DON'T.

13:26.770 --> 13:29.000
- KRISTINA. ..

13:29.040 --> 13:32.180
YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH HELL
AND BACK.

13:32.220 --> 13:33.596
LET'S DO SOMETHING GREAT
TOGETHER.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.774
[doorbell ringing]
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

13:39.810 --> 13:41.778
- JUST AN HOUR, RIGHT?
- YEAH. YEAH, I PROMISE.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.846
OKAY,
LET'S LET THE HYENAS IN.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.051
HI.
- HI!

13:47.100 --> 13:49.853
- OH, MY GOSH.
LOOK!

13:49.890 --> 13:52.063
- SO SWEET!
- SHE'S EVEN WHITER

13:52.100 --> 13:53.920
THAN SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.175
ARE LIGHT-SKINNED, SO...
- LIGHT-SKINNED?

13:58.210 --> 14:00.690
SHE'S MORE LIKE AN ALBINO.
- SHE'S GORGEOUS!

14:00.730 --> 14:03.665
WE HAVE A TON OF FOOD.
- YOU'RE SAYING WORDS OUT LOUD.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.383
- A LOT OF IT NEEDS TO BE
HEATED UP.

14:05.430 --> 14:06.874
- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S
ENOUGH TIME FOR THAT.

14:06.910 --> 14:08.389
- OH, WE HAVE ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.079
- YOU GOT A NAME
FOR THAT BABY YET, CROS?

14:10.120 --> 14:12.987
- YOU KNOW, WE'RE WORKING ON IT,
BUT THANKS FOR BRINGING IT UP.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.499
- SURE.
- WHAT ABOUT AVA?

14:14.540 --> 14:17.225
WE WERE GONNA NAME NORA AVA...
- LIKE HITLER'S GIRLFRIEND?

14:17.270 --> 14:18.396
- I LOVE AVA!
WHAT ABOUT THE LAST NAM E?

14:18.440 --> 14:23.685
I'M THINKING OF MAYBE
MONOGRAMMING A LITTLE SOMETHING?

14:23.720 --> 14:25.927
- WELL, BRAVERMAN
WILL BE THE--

14:25.960 --> 14:27.689
- TRUSSELL-BRAVERMAN, MAYBE.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.540
- OR TRUS--TRUSSELL-BRAVERMAN.

14:29.590 --> 14:31.478
- THAT'S A LITTLE LONG.
YOU WANT SOMETHING

14:31.520 --> 14:33.249
THAT'LL FIT ON THE BACK
OF A FOOTBALL JERSEY.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.555
- THEN I SHOULD BE
A BRAVERMAN TOO.

14:35.590 --> 14:38.525
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
- OKAY, YOU KNOW...

14:38.560 --> 14:40.903
MAYBE EVERYONE COULD JUST EMAIL
ALL THEIR SUGGESTIONS TO US,

14:40.940 --> 14:42.760
AND WE'LL PORE THROUGH 'EM
AND DO A "REPLY ALL."

14:42.810 --> 14:44.698
- JUST HAVING FUN.
COME ON, HEY.

14:44.740 --> 14:46.799
- SOMEONE'S CRANKY.
- TON OF FUN.

14:46.850 --> 14:48.704
- DIDN'T MEAN TO BE PUSHY.

14:48.740 --> 14:50.253
- WOW. SOMEBODY
MISSED HIS NAP TIME.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.255
- I GUESS SO.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.779
- HOW'S DREW?
HOW'S SCHOOL?

14:52.820 --> 14:55.744
- HE'S LOVING IT.
- GOD, THAT'S GREAT.

14:55.790 --> 14:57.337
- HE'S REALLY
CHALLENGING HIMSELF.

14:57.370 --> 15:00.237
HE'S TAKING THIS KARL MARX
CLASS THAT HE WAS EXCITED ABOUT.

15:00.270 --> 15:01.589
- WHAT IS THIS?
- OH, BOY.

15:01.620 --> 15:02.826
- DREW TAKING THE MARX CLASS.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.475
- OH, HE'S NOT TAKING THAT
ANYMORE.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.135
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- HE DROPPED IT.

15:06.180 --> 15:08.273
- OH. WELL...
HE DROPPED IT.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.584
- SO HE DROPPED
HIS KARL MARX CLASS.

15:10.630 --> 15:12.074
- I GUESS SO.
[both laugh]

15:12.110 --> 15:13.418
- THIS LOOKS REALLY...

15:13.460 --> 15:16.042
- WHAT'S GOING ON THERE, CROSBY?
YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.149
- OH, WELL...
- MM. THANK YOU.

15:17.190 --> 15:18.327
- THAT'S SUCH A NICE WAY
TO PUT IT.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.635
- HE'S NOT GETTING HIS
EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP THAT HE--

15:20.670 --> 15:22.319
- EIGHT-HOUR CROSBY.
- WELL, I DON'T WANT TO MISS

15:22.360 --> 15:25.124
ANY MOMENT WITH THE BABY,
SO I'M TRYING TO BE UP

15:25.160 --> 15:26.889
FOR THE FEEDINGS
AND WHATNOT.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.433
- WELL, FOR THE BABY'S SAKE,

15:28.470 --> 15:30.643
ONE OF YOU SHOULD BE
WELL RESTED.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.545
- YEAH.
ONE OF US SHOULD.

15:34.550 --> 15:36.780
- DOES THAT--THAT MEAN THAT...
I'M GONNA GET TO BE ONE?

15:36.830 --> 15:38.855
- GOOD JOB, NORA.
PUT IT RIGHT HERE

15:38.900 --> 15:42.176
SO WE CAN PLAY
BASKETBALL, OKAY?

15:43.770 --> 15:45.909
- HOW'S RYAN HOLDING UP?

15:45.940 --> 15:47.760
- UH...
[scoffs]

15:47.800 --> 15:49.358
HARD TO SAY, TO BE HONEST.

15:49.390 --> 15:51.767
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS...
STATIONED?

15:51.810 --> 15:53.323
- NO IDEA.
NO IDEA WHERE HE IS

15:53.360 --> 15:56.534
OR WHAT HIS DAY IS LIKE
OR ANYTHING, SO...

15:56.570 --> 15:57.844
- CAN'T BELIEVE
HE GOT CALLED BACK.

15:57.880 --> 15:58.983
THAT JUST SEEMS...

15:59.020 --> 16:02.433
- BUT I MEAN, HE'S IN
THE RESERVES, I GUESS, SO...

16:02.470 --> 16:03.129
THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.232
- YEAH.
WELL...

16:06.270 --> 16:10.479
IF I GET
THIS BIG, UH, CONTRACT, UM...

16:10.520 --> 16:11.680
LET HIM KNOW
HE'S GOT A JOB WITH ME.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.859
- FOR REAL?

16:13.900 --> 16:15.720
- YEAH.
- THAT'S MAD COOL, UNCLE JOEL.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.206
THANKS.
- SURE.

16:18.250 --> 16:21.242
- I'M GONNA PEE.
- OKAY.

16:21.290 --> 16:23.975
- YOU SURE YOU CAN--
- YEAH. I DON'T THINK

16:24.010 --> 16:26.069
ANYTHING'S GONNA WAKE THEM UP
AT THIS POINT.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.248
YEAH, THANKS.
- DON'T LET 'EM BITE YOU.

16:29.290 --> 16:30.848
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IT WAS, SO...

16:30.880 --> 16:31.847
- HEY.
- HI. WHAT'S WRONG?

16:31.880 --> 16:34.747
- I'M JUST IN A WEIRD MOOD.
- WHAT HAPPENED?

16:34.780 --> 16:36.645
- NOTHING. I JUST--
I WAS TALKING TO UNCLE JOEL

16:36.680 --> 16:40.400
ABOUT RYAN, AND I FEEL SAD,
AND I MISS HIM,

16:40.440 --> 16:42.544
AND--I DON'T KNOW--
I'M STRESSED

16:42.580 --> 16:44.309
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
HE WAS, LIKE, DISTANT

16:44.340 --> 16:46.160
THE LAST COUPLE OF TIMES--
- I KNOW. YOU SAID THAT.

16:46.210 --> 16:48.030
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
BUT I'M JUST WONDERING--

16:48.070 --> 16:49.059
[baby shrieks]
- WELL, DISTANT IS A BIG DEAL.

16:49.110 --> 16:51.624
IT HURTS, DOESN'T IT?
IT HITS ON A LEVEL...

16:51.660 --> 16:53.275
- IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A...
- IT'S LIKE A DOG WHISTLE.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.413
- SERIOUS EMERGENCY.
- YOU WANT ME TO HELP?

16:55.460 --> 16:57.143
- NO, NO,
VISIT WITH YOUR FAMILY.

16:57.180 --> 16:59.319
[baby crying]
- SHE'S AN ANGEL.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.590
- SHE'S SO CUTE.
- REALLY, THAT'S--

17:01.640 --> 17:02.948
[door slams]

17:02.980 --> 17:04.459
- SHOULD WE GO?

17:04.500 --> 17:06.047
- COFFEE?

17:06.090 --> 17:07.250
- DEFINITELY. 100%
- WANT SOME COFFEE?

17:07.300 --> 17:09.768
- WE SHOULD GO.
[baby continues crying]

17:11.780 --> 17:14.237
- I WOULD BE RUNNING
HIS MAYORAL CAMPAIGN, OKAY?

17:14.270 --> 17:16.431
- I UNDERSTAND.
- I'D BE HEADING UP EDUCATION.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.539
IF HE WINS,
HE'D PUT ME ON STAFF.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.275
I'D GET TO RUB ELBOWS
WITH PEOPLE

17:20.310 --> 17:21.516
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET.

17:21.550 --> 17:23.757
AND WHO KNOWS? MAYBE SOMEDAY
I COULD EVEN RUN FOR OFFICE.

17:23.800 --> 17:24.619
- I GET IT.
- YOU NEVER KNOW.

17:24.660 --> 17:25.968
- HE'S MAKING IT SOUND
REAL GREAT.

17:26.010 --> 17:28.103
THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM--
HE'S A LIAR.

17:28.150 --> 17:29.629
- OKAY, I KNOW
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE THE GUY,

17:29.660 --> 17:30.524
BUT THIS IS MY DREAM.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.312
I'M NOT JUST GONNA BE
A SPEECH WRITER.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.282
- LET'S NOT FORGET WHAT
HE TRIED TO DO WITH AMBER.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.561
HE BASICALLY PROMOTED HER,
TOOK HER TO SACRAMENTO,

17:36.600 --> 17:38.283
SO HE COULD, YOU KNOW...
- WATCH IT.

17:38.330 --> 17:41.049
- WHAT? HE TRIED TO GET HER
TO PLAY WITH HIS BLOCKS.

17:41.090 --> 17:43.809
- HE DIDN'T GET THE BLOCKS
IN THE HOLES.

17:43.850 --> 17:44.635
- THAT--WHAT?

17:44.680 --> 17:45.840
- I CAN'T MAKE
THE METAPHOR WORK.

17:45.890 --> 17:46.982
ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

17:47.030 --> 17:49.339
YOU EVEN SAID YOURSELF,
"SEIZE THE DAY."

17:49.370 --> 17:50.302
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.
- I GET IT--I KNOW

17:50.340 --> 17:52.160
YOU WANT TO SEIZE THE DAY.
- CARPE DIEM.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.065
- I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU
MAKE A MISTAKE, OKAY?

17:54.100 --> 17:56.898
AND I THINK WORKING FOR A GUY
YOU DON'T TRUST AND RESPECT

17:56.930 --> 17:58.443
COULD WIND UP BEING
A HUGE MISTAKE.

17:58.490 --> 17:59.650
- OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T FULLY TRUST HIM ALWAYS.

17:59.690 --> 18:02.318
- I'M LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.
- I GET IT.

18:02.350 --> 18:03.863
- PLEASE JUST TALK TO BOB
AND TELL HIM NO.

18:03.910 --> 18:05.696
- OKAY, FINE. I'M NOT
TELLING HIM NO YET, ADAM.

18:05.730 --> 18:07.379
- MAX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:07.430 --> 18:08.078
- NO, NO, NO, MAX,
YOU CAN'T JUST--

18:08.120 --> 18:10.008
YOU CAN'T JUST PICK HER UP.

18:10.050 --> 18:11.358
- IT'S OKAY, HONEY.
- COME HERE, HONEY.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.799
COME HERE--I GOT HER.
- SHE SUCKS.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.294
- HONEY, HONEY.
- NORA SUCKS.

18:14.330 --> 18:16.321
SHE'S A TERRIBLE MODEL.
- DON'T JUST GRAB HER LIKE THAT.

18:16.370 --> 18:18.361
SHE'S A BABY STILL, BABE.
- IT'S OKAY. I GOT YOU.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.459
- HANK TOLD ME I NEED TO TAKE
10,000 PICTURES.

18:20.510 --> 18:22.535
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN HANK TOLD YOU
TO TAKE 10,000 PICTURES?

18:22.580 --> 18:24.673
- HANK? SARAH'S HANK?
- YEAH, HANK.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.540
- WHEN DID YOU SEE HANK?
- I SAW HIM YESTERDAY.

18:26.580 --> 18:27.956
I WALKED TO HIS SHOP.
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.206
- YOU WALKED BY YOURSELF
TO HIS SHOP?

18:29.240 --> 18:30.446
- YEAH. HE'S IN MY RADIUS.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.469
- MAX, THE RADIUS
WASN'T SET UP

18:31.520 --> 18:33.272
FOR YOU TO GO
TO HANK'S PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO.

18:33.310 --> 18:34.584
- WELL, IT'S IN MY RADIUS,
SO I'M ALLOWED

18:36.660 --> 18:40.039
- I GOT THERE AT 12:36
AND I LEFT AT 2:17.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.559
- YOU WERE THERE
FOR TWO HOURS?

18:41.600 --> 18:42.828
- NO. I WAS THERE
FOR 1 HOUR AND 41 MINUTES.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.257
- OKAY.
- AND ANYWAYS, HANK SAYS

18:45.290 --> 18:46.632
I HAVE TO START TAKING
PICTURES OF PEOPLE NOW,

18:46.670 --> 18:48.490
'CAUSE THEY MAY BE
A PAIN IN THE ASS,

18:48.540 --> 18:51.293
BUT THEY PAY
TO GET THEIR PICTURES TAKEN.

18:51.330 --> 18:52.365
- OKAY.
- IF KEEP TAKING PICTURES

18:52.400 --> 18:53.298
OF BUGS AND LIZARDS,

18:53.330 --> 18:54.297
HE SAYS I'LL END UP
POOR AND HOMELESS.

18:54.340 --> 18:55.409
MOM, TURN THIS WAY.
- I DON'T REALLY WANT

18:55.440 --> 18:57.749
MY PICTURE TAKEN.
HONEY, I DIDN'T BRUSH MY TEETH.

18:57.790 --> 19:01.339
- KRISTINA, YOU TALK TO BOB.
I'LL TALK TO HAN K, OKAY?

19:01.380 --> 19:02.756
- ALL RIGHT, BYE.
- I GUESS.

19:02.790 --> 19:04.234
- THERE SHE IS.
- HEY.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.542
- HI.
- MORNING.

19:05.590 --> 19:07.444
- I GOT YOUR BAGEL.
- THANK GOD.

19:07.490 --> 19:08.650
- THEY DIDN'T HAVE
THE CHEESY KIND

19:08.690 --> 19:09.486
WITH THE CHEESE ON TOP.
- WHAT?

19:09.520 --> 19:10.862
- IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU
ANYWAY.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.107
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM DREW?

19:13.150 --> 19:14.868
- UH, LIKE SPECIFICALLY
OR JUST IN GENERAL?

19:14.910 --> 19:17.287
- AT ALL.
- YEAH, I MEAN...

19:17.320 --> 19:19.379
WE TALK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.
HE'S BUSY WITH SCHOOL.

19:19.430 --> 19:21.045
- HOW IS HE?
- HE'S GOOD.

19:21.090 --> 19:22.079
- HE JUST DOESN'T--

19:22.120 --> 19:23.985
YOU KNOW, I WROTE HIM
THIS BIG, LONG EMAIL,

19:24.020 --> 19:25.362
AND THEN HE SENT ME A TEXT.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.777
BY THE WAY, DON'T SEND A TEXT
IN RESPONSE TO AN EMAIL.

19:27.820 --> 19:28.639
THAT'S JUST RUDE.
- IS IT?

19:28.680 --> 19:30.819
- HE SAID,
"GOING TO CLASS. GTG."

19:30.850 --> 19:32.408
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- IT MEANS, YOU KNOW...

19:32.440 --> 19:34.260
"GOT TO--GOT TO GO."

19:34.310 --> 19:35.925
- WHAT IS "BRB"?

19:35.960 --> 19:36.881
- IT'S "BE RIGHT BACK."

19:36.930 --> 19:39.376
- AND THEN,
HERE'S THE BIGGEST INSULT--

19:39.410 --> 19:40.752
"LOVE IUIIII
JUST "U," THE LETTER "U."

19:40.800 --> 19:42.722
NOT THE WHOLE WORD.
JUST THE LETTER.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.388
I GAVE BIRTH TO "U."

19:45.420 --> 19:47.524
DON'T I DESERVE THE "Y"
AND THE "O"?

19:47.560 --> 19:49.357
- SASSY. LOVE IT.
- AND THANKS?

19:49.390 --> 19:50.766
BUT SERIOUSLY...
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:50.810 --> 19:51.799
YOU'RE VERY SENSITIVE
ABOUT THIS.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.694
- OF COURSE.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

19:53.740 --> 19:56.561
HE'S GONE, AND I'M JUST
INTERESTED, YOU KNOW?

19:56.600 --> 19:58.249
HE'S NOT EVEN THAT FAR AWAY,
AND IT FEELS LIKE

19:58.300 --> 19:59.631
HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE GONE

19:59.680 --> 20:00.704
TO, YOU KNOW,
THE EAST COAST OR SOMETHING.

20:00.750 --> 20:03.742
- I WOULDN'T TAKE
THE ABBREVIATIONS PERSONALLY.

20:03.780 --> 20:06.340
I DON'T THINK IT MEANS--
- AND THEN HE SENT ME

20:06.370 --> 20:08.338
THIS LITTLE YELLOW
SMILEY FACE.

20:08.370 --> 20:09.712
WHAT IS THAT?
- A LITTLE EMOJI ART FOR YA?

20:09.760 --> 20:11.785
- I WANT TO SEND HIM
EMOJI ART BACK.

20:11.830 --> 20:14.515
SHOW ME HOW TO DO IT.
MAYBE HE'LL RESPOND TO ME THEN.

20:14.550 --> 20:16.302
- OH, BOY.
THERE GOES MY MORNING.

20:16.350 --> 20:17.829
- HEY, YOU GOT FREE
BAGEL DELIVERY.

20:17.870 --> 20:19.622
- OH, MY GOD.
- I KNOW HOW TO BUY APPS.

20:19.660 --> 20:20.581
- LISTEN, IF YOU'RE FEELING
SENSITIVE ABOUT DREW,

20:20.630 --> 20:23.246
I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST,
YOU KNOW, CALL HIM

20:23.290 --> 20:24.359
OR TELL HIM
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.834
- ISN'T IT FUN THAT I LIVE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD NOW?

20:25.870 --> 20:28.703
YOU CAN SHOW ME
HOW TO EMOJI THINGS AND STUFF.

20:28.740 --> 20:31.083
GOOD TIMES!
- IT'S GONNA BE A LONG...

20:31.120 --> 20:32.633
LONG SUMMER.
- GOOD TIMES!

20:32.670 --> 20:34.877
- AND THEN THERE WAS WHAT YOU
DID AT GENSUNG CORPORATION.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.148
- GENSUNG. MY GOD.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.952
YEAH, THAT WAS
TWO YEARS OF MY LIFE.

20:37.990 --> 20:39.400
- WE STILL TALK
ABOUT THAT CASE.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.954
I WAS JUST HAVING LUNCH
WITH ERIC GAINOR THE OTHER DAY,

20:41.990 --> 20:44.641
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
HOW YOU RESTRUCTURED THE DEBT.

20:44.690 --> 20:46.442
IT WAS GENIUS.
I TELL ALL MY GUYS--

20:46.480 --> 20:48.345
"YOU WANT TO SEE HOW IT'S DONE,

20:48.380 --> 20:50.029
YOU LOOK AT THE OPINION
IN THAT CASE."

20:50.070 --> 20:51.583
- WELL, IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.030
- MY ASS.
IT WAS ALL YOU.

20:53.070 --> 20:54.458
YOU'RE LIKE A...

20:54.490 --> 20:56.481
YOU'RE LIKE A LEGEND
AROUND HERE.

20:56.530 --> 20:58.555
I COULDN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE
COMING IN FOR THIS JOB.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.693
- WELL, I TOOK A YEAR OFF
TO BE WITH MY FAMILY, YOU KNOW,

21:00.740 --> 21:03.629
AND I'M READY
TO GET BACK TO MY LIFE,

21:03.670 --> 21:06.252
AND I'D LIKE TO DO IT HERE
AT YOUR FIRM.

21:06.290 --> 21:08.326
- LOOK, I'M--I'M SO FAMILIAR
WITH YOUR WORK.

21:08.370 --> 21:10.565
I'M A HUGE FAN,
HONESTLY.

21:10.610 --> 21:12.532
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL
YOUR REFERENCES

21:12.580 --> 21:15.026
FOR FORMAL REASONS
AND YOUR FORMER EMPLOYER.

21:15.060 --> 21:16.334
I'M A LITTLE CURIOUS

21:16.370 --> 21:18.930
WHY YOU DON'T HAVE LEON DENGRAF
LISTED, BUT...

21:18.960 --> 21:21.611
- OH.
UH, YES, OF COURSE.

21:21.650 --> 21:23.538
[clears throat]
WELL...

21:23.590 --> 21:26.241
I DECIDED THE CRITERIA
FOR MY REFERENCES WOULD BE

21:26.280 --> 21:29.659
THAT THEY KNEW ALL MY WORK
ON MORE OF A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS,

21:29.700 --> 21:31.759
AND LEON IS LEON DENGRAF,
CERTAINLY,

21:31.800 --> 21:34.769
BUT HE'S ALSO MOSTLY
ON THE GOLF COURSE THESE DAYS,

21:34.810 --> 21:37.449
SO...

21:37.500 --> 21:40.594
- GOOD.
I MEAN, SO THERE WASN'T--

21:40.640 --> 21:43.393
THERE WAS NO PROBLEM
WITH LEON OR...

21:43.440 --> 21:47.467
- NO. LEON WAS PROBABLY
NOT HAPPY

21:47.510 --> 21:49.296
THAT I DECIDED
TO TAKE THAT YEAR OFF.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.671
- MM-HMM.
- BUT, YOU KNOW...

21:50.720 --> 21:52.403
IT WAS A DECISION I FELT
I HAD TO MAKE AT THE TIME.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.953
I'M IN A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PLACE NOW

21:54.000 --> 21:55.160
AND FULLY READY TO COMMIT.

21:55.210 --> 21:57.269
- YEAH.
- SO...

21:57.310 --> 21:58.823
- WELL, I MEAN, IT'S JUST--

21:58.860 --> 22:02.341
LIKE I SAID,
I WILL NEED TO CONTACT HIM.

22:02.390 --> 22:04.005
- GREAT.
[chuckles]

22:04.040 --> 22:06.144
- CROSBY.
- HUH?

22:06.180 --> 22:07.522
- CROSBY!
- HUH?

22:07.560 --> 22:09.141
- THE TOAST IS BURNING.
THERE'S SMOKE EVERY--

22:09.180 --> 22:10.829
WHAT ARE YOU--WHAT'S GOING ON?
- OH, NO. CRAP, CRAP, CRAP!

22:10.880 --> 22:13.428
GO, GO, GET AWAY,
GET AWAY, GET AWAY.

22:13.470 --> 22:15.426
UH-OH. OH, COME ON!
- YOU FELL ASLEEP

22:15.470 --> 22:16.539
MAKING MY SANDWICH.
I'M STARVING.

22:16.570 --> 22:20.438
- OH, MAN, I DIDN'T CHOOSE
TO FALL ASLEEP, OKAY?

22:20.470 --> 22:22.529
I WAS WAITING FOR THE TOAST,

22:22.580 --> 22:23.979
AND MY EYES INVOLUNTARILY
CEASED TO REMAIN OPEN.

22:24.030 --> 22:27.431
- OKAY, WELL, MAYBE IF YOUR
FAMILY HADN'T STAYED OVER

22:27.480 --> 22:29.334
FOR, LIKE, FIVE HOURS,
YOU'D BE MORE RESTED.

22:29.380 --> 22:30.233
- OH, YEAH.
IT'S MY FAMILY'S FAULT

22:30.270 --> 22:32.409
THAT WE HAVEN'T SLEPT
FOR FOUR DAYS.

22:32.450 --> 22:34.509
ALL FOUR DAYS THEIR FAULT?
- CAN YOU, UM...

22:34.560 --> 22:35.788
- YEAH, I BUY THAT.
- CAN YOU MAKE SURE

22:35.830 --> 22:37.445
YOU SMOOTH
THE PEANUT BUTTER OUT?

22:37.490 --> 22:38.388
- JASMINE,
DON'T MICROMANAGE ME.

22:38.420 --> 22:40.479
I'M MAKING A PEANUT BUTTER--
- I'M NOT!

22:40.530 --> 22:42.521
- DESPITE BURNING THE TOAST...
- JUST MAKE IT

22:42.560 --> 22:44.733
HOWEVER YOU WANT TO MAKE IT.
- THIS IS CRAZY.

22:44.770 --> 22:46.522
- WHAT?
- THIS! WHERE I GOT TO WAKE UP

22:46.570 --> 22:47.559
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

22:47.600 --> 22:49.158
TO WATCH YOU BREAST-FEED
THE BABY.

22:49.190 --> 22:51.875
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING OTHER
THAN JUST NOT GETTING SLEEP.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.740
SOME PEOPLE MAY ONLY NEED
A COUPLE HOURS OF SLEEP.

22:53.780 --> 22:55.395
I NEED EIGHT, OKAY?
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE AT PEACE

22:55.440 --> 22:56.259
WITH NOT HAVING A NAME
FOR THE BABY.

22:56.300 --> 22:58.473
I WOULD LIKE A NAME
FOR OUR BABY.

22:58.510 --> 23:00.330
- OKAY. WELL, I MEAN,
IF YOU NEED EIGHT HOURS,

23:00.370 --> 23:01.473
YOU NEED EIGHT HOURS, RIGHT?

23:01.510 --> 23:03.091
I MEAN, CLEARLY,
YOUR MOMMY THINKS YOU DO.

23:03.140 --> 23:04.300
SHE CAN NAME THE BABY.

23:04.340 --> 23:05.784
- WHAT DOES MY MOM
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

23:05.830 --> 23:06.922
- BECAUSE YOU INVITED
YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY OVER HERE

23:06.970 --> 23:08.926
FOR THE ENTIRE DAY--

23:08.970 --> 23:11.484
- I TOLD YOU TEN TIMES
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.579
I DON'T--
I DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THEM!

23:13.630 --> 23:16.417
IT'S LIKE HAVING A TEAM
OF BILLY GOATS IN THE ROOM.

23:16.460 --> 23:17.859
I CAN'T JUST--
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

23:17.910 --> 23:21.209
[baby crying]
- HERE, I HAVE TO PEE.

23:21.260 --> 23:22.466
CAN YOU PLEASE
HOLD YOUR DAUGHTER

23:22.500 --> 23:24.707
BEFORE YOU GO GET
YOUR BEAUTY SLEEP?

23:24.740 --> 23:27.493
[baby continues crying]

23:31.470 --> 23:32.198
- I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING TO BE
THE BEST THING

23:32.230 --> 23:34.471
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME
SOMEDAY,

23:34.510 --> 23:36.125
BUT RIGHT NOW
I JUST REALLY HATE YOU.

23:36.170 --> 23:37.091
[baby cries]

23:46.390 --> 23:47.277
- HEY.
- HEY.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.595
- ADAM.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

23:49.630 --> 23:51.382
WHAT, AM I IN YOUR RADIUS TOO?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.216
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- NO. HE'S FINE.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.423
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
- SO, UH...

23:55.460 --> 23:59.089
THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT
IN MINNESOTA, HUH?

23:59.120 --> 24:00.462
- YEAH, WELL...

24:00.500 --> 24:02.673
THE WEATHER SUCKS THERE, SO...
- YEAH.

24:02.710 --> 24:05.122
BUT YOU MOVED THERE
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER, RIGHT?

24:05.160 --> 24:06.718
- YEAH, I DID, BUT, UH...

24:06.750 --> 24:09.992
[chuckles]
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE THING.

24:10.030 --> 24:10.780
AS SOON AS I GOT THERE,

24:10.820 --> 24:12.685
MY EX-WIFE AND I
STARTED TO ARGUE,

24:12.720 --> 24:13.948
AND EVERYBODY'S UPSET.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.549
IS THAT BETTER FOR MY DAUGHTER
THAT I'M THERE?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.207
- WELL, I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS A...

24:21.250 --> 24:22.239
GOOD THING YOU DID,

24:22.280 --> 24:24.100
BUT IT HAD TO BE A TOUGH
DECISION TO COME BACK.

24:24.150 --> 24:25.242
- YEAH, IT WASN'T EASY,
BUT IT'S OKAY.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.349
- LISTEN, I WANT TO PAY YOU
FOR FIXING MAX'S CAMERA.

24:27.390 --> 24:29.278
SO HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU?
- YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING.

24:29.320 --> 24:31.629
IT WASN'T EVEN BROKEN.

24:31.670 --> 24:32.807
- WELL, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
NOT PAYING.

24:32.850 --> 24:34.226
SO, IF YOU COULD TELL ME
HOW MUCH--

24:34.260 --> 24:35.397
- OH, OKAY.
IT'S $1,425.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.398
- [laughs]

24:37.440 --> 24:38.771
- COME ON, IT'S NOTHING.
- ALL RIGHT.

24:38.820 --> 24:40.219
- IT'S NOTHING.
- THANK YOU.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.225
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

24:41.270 --> 24:43.090
THE SHUTTER WAS JAMMED.
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

24:43.130 --> 24:46.167
- WELL, LISTEN, I KNOW MAX
WAS HERE FOR OVER TWO HOURS,

24:46.200 --> 24:47.019
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ENTERTAIN HIM.

24:47.070 --> 24:49.470
YOU KNOW,
HE CAN BE REAL PERSISTENT.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.067
SO, IF YOU WANT HIM TO LEAVE,
YOU JUST TELL HIM TO LEAVE.

24:51.110 --> 24:52.759
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT.

24:52.800 --> 24:53.687
HE WAS OKAY, YOU KNOW?

24:53.730 --> 24:55.789
HE LOOKED AROUND.
HE ASKED SOME QUESTIONS.

24:55.830 --> 24:58.003
I DIDN'T MIND IT.
- OH.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.147
OKAY.

25:01.180 --> 25:04.001
LISTEN, I JUST W--
I'M SURE THIS ISN'T WHAT IT IS,

25:04.050 --> 25:04.869
BUT I JUST REALLY
WANT TO BE SURE

25:04.910 --> 25:06.775
THAT YOU'RE NOT HANGING OUT
WITH MAX

25:06.810 --> 25:08.562
HOPING YOU CAN GET
BACK TOGETHER WITH MY SISTER.

25:08.610 --> 25:10.157
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT WHAT...

25:11.440 --> 25:14.159
I'M SURE THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT IS, BUT...

25:14.200 --> 25:15.747
- WELL, I-I-I-I--

25:15.790 --> 25:17.508
ARE YOU SERIOUS, NOW?

25:17.550 --> 25:19.199
ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT THIS?
- LOOK, SHE JUST--

25:19.240 --> 25:20.400
SHE SAID YOU WERE REALLY HURT
WHEN SHE BROKE UP WITH YOU.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.307
- A MUTUAL BREAKUP.

25:23.340 --> 25:24.853
IT WAS A MUTUAL BREAKUP.
- HANK...

25:24.900 --> 25:26.037
I KNOW SHE BROKE UP WITH YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK...

25:26.070 --> 25:28.379
I'M GONNA CLEAR THIS UP
FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY, OKAY?

25:28.420 --> 25:30.695
- OKAY.
- OKAY? I WENT AWAY...

25:30.730 --> 25:32.459
AND, OF COURSE,
PEOPLE MOVE ON.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.037
- SURE.
- AND I GET THAT.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.379
AND PEOPLE HAVE TO, UH...
HAVE TO FIND THEMSELVES.

25:37.430 --> 25:38.567
AND THAT'S OKAY WITH ME.
- OKAY.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.909
- I'M OKAY WITH IT.
WE'RE FRIENDS.

25:40.950 --> 25:42.394
THAT WAS A MUTUAL BREAKUP.

25:42.430 --> 25:44.637
- OKAY. I GOT IT--
M-MUTUAL.

25:44.680 --> 25:47.126
- YEAH. NOW, WHAT?
YOU THINK I'M USING MAX

25:47.160 --> 25:48.536
TO GET TO HER--
I GOT TO BE HONEST.

25:48.580 --> 25:49.501
I-I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

25:49.540 --> 25:51.883
THE KID LIKES PHOTOGRAPHY.
YOU KNOW THAT?

25:51.920 --> 25:54.400
HE CAME IN HERE.
HE HAD SOME PICTURES HE TOOK.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.475
HE'S NOT BAD.

25:55.510 --> 25:58.092
YOU DON'T WANT HIM HERE,
THAT'S FINE.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.517
JUST--I DON'T CARE.
TAKE HIM OUT OF MY RADIUS.

26:00.550 --> 26:01.414
THAT'S ALL.
- LOOK, YOU KNOW...

26:01.450 --> 26:04.066
YOU HAVING HIM IN HERE--
I DIDN'T KNOW

26:04.110 --> 26:05.247
HIS INTEREST IN PHOTOGRAPHY
WAS THAT GREAT,

26:05.280 --> 26:07.623
AND QUITE FRANKLY HE CAN BE,
YOU KNOW, A BIT OF A...

26:07.660 --> 26:08.410
- WHAT? A PAIN IN THE ASS?
HE'S NOT.

26:08.460 --> 26:10.860
HE'S NOT.

26:10.910 --> 26:12.423
YOU--
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

26:12.460 --> 26:13.358
YOU'RE ON THE FENCE.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.848
HEY.
WHAT IS IT?

26:19.880 --> 26:21.916
- I DIDN'T GET THE JOB.

26:21.950 --> 26:23.884
- YOU--[sighs]
- THEY WENT ANOTHER WAY WITH IT.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.297
- OH, HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

26:26.340 --> 26:27.716
THOSE JERKS.
- I KNOW.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.331
[doorbell rings]
OH, MY GOD.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.711
OKAY, HERE, HERE.
- THAT'S PEET.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.478
- YEP. I GUESS WE REALLY DO
NEED THIS JOB NOW, HUH?

26:32.520 --> 26:33.828
- OH, NO PRESSURE.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.589
- I'M GONNA PLAY
THE SUPPORTIVE WIFE,

26:35.620 --> 26:38.418
AND I'M JUST GONNA CHARM
THE PANTS OFF OF HIM.

26:38.450 --> 26:39.792
- OKAY.
- NOT LITERALLY, YOU KNOW.

26:39.830 --> 26:40.694
- HONEY, UM...
PEET MIGHT NOT BE

26:40.730 --> 26:43.244
EXACTLY WHO
YOU'RE PICTURING, SO...

26:43.290 --> 26:45.872
- [British accent]
HI. YOU MUST BE JULIA.

26:45.910 --> 26:47.969
- YOU MUST BE PEET.

26:48.020 --> 26:49.453
- YES.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.252
- HEY.

26:51.290 --> 26:52.917
COME ON IN!

26:52.950 --> 26:54.531
- PEET, YOUR WORK IS INCREDIBLE.
- OH...

26:54.570 --> 26:56.674
- YEAH, JOEL SHOWED ME
YOUR PORTFOLIO,

26:56.710 --> 27:00.294
AND THAT, UM--THAT FARMHOUSE
IN MILL VALLEY...

27:00.340 --> 27:01.261
- OH!
- WOW.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.052
IT'S A FANTASY.
- YEAH, WELL, THANK YOU.

27:03.100 --> 27:04.749
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
- YEAH.

27:04.790 --> 27:07.338
- WELL, YOU PREPPED HER WELL.
- WHAT? NO!

27:07.380 --> 27:09.587
I'M JUST EXCITED ABOUT THE...

27:09.620 --> 27:11.554
YOU KNOW, POSSIBILITY
OF WORKING WITH YOU.

27:11.590 --> 27:13.933
- YEAH. WELL, SLOW DOWN,
SPEED RACER.

27:13.970 --> 27:15.653
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.
- [laughs] I KNOW.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.520
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, JULIA?
WHAT DO YOU DO?

27:17.560 --> 27:20.211
- MM.
ME--I'M...

27:20.250 --> 27:21.592
I'M HERE.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.289
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

27:23.330 --> 27:23.978
- OH. GREAT.

27:26.260 --> 27:27.739
- YEAH, IT IS.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.941
- JULIA'S ALSO, UM,

27:29.990 --> 27:31.503
ACTUALLY
AN INCREDIBLE LAWYER.

27:31.540 --> 27:35.294
SHE'S JUST TAKING SOME TIME OFF
TO BE WITH THE KIDS, SO...

27:35.340 --> 27:36.989
- RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S
AN AMAZING THING--

27:37.030 --> 27:39.089
A LUXURY TO BE ABLE
TO DO THAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE.

27:39.140 --> 27:39.822
- TRULY. IT REALLY IS.
- AND I COULD TELL

27:39.860 --> 27:42.408
YOU WEREN'T JUST
A HOUSEWIFE.

27:42.450 --> 27:45.658
I MEAN, NOT THAT THERE'S
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT,

27:45.690 --> 27:46.759
'CAUSE IT'S GREAT.
- NO, I--YEAH.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.519
- BUT I COULD JUST SEE IT.
I MEAN, THAT'S GREAT.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.346
IT'S A FULL-TIME JOB, RIGHT?

27:51.390 --> 27:53.244
IT'S GREAT.
- YES.

27:53.290 --> 27:55.872
YEAH. MORE THAN FULL-TIME.
- YEAH, I'M SURE.

27:55.910 --> 27:59.118
- THAT'S FOR SU--WOW.

28:01.610 --> 28:02.838
- HEY.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.324

28:04.370 --> 28:07.089
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

28:07.130 --> 28:09.712
- OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.

28:09.750 --> 28:12.469
- GWEN'S RIGHT HERE.

28:12.510 --> 28:15.479
HELLO.

28:16.900 --> 28:17.548

28:17.590 --> 28:19.729
BEAUTIFUL FRIEND?

28:23.840 --> 28:25.933
- YOU DO.
YOU LOOK ALL WARM AND SNUGGLY.

28:25.980 --> 28:28.938
- WELL, YOU KNOW ME.
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

28:28.980 --> 28:29.548
- NO.
- NEVER GIVE UP.

28:29.600 --> 28:31.636
- THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.422
- NEVER, NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER GIVE UP.

28:33.470 --> 28:35.188
- I BROUGHT YOU SOME GOODIES.
- THANK YOU.

28:35.230 --> 28:36.879
- I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS,
BUT HE'S HALF-NAKED, SO...

28:36.920 --> 28:38.467
- OOH, OKAY.
- ENJOY.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.432
SOME SNACKS.

28:39.470 --> 28:41.529
- OH...
- NO.

28:41.580 --> 28:42.842
- GIN RUMMY?

28:42.890 --> 28:45.506
- MM.
YEAH, MAYBE LATER.

28:45.550 --> 28:46.505
- HOW YOU DOING?
- I'M ALL RIGHT.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.097
- YEAH? YOU COMFY?
- LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU.

28:48.140 --> 28:50.096
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?
THE LAST TIME WE TALKED,

28:50.140 --> 28:52.722
YOU WERE THINKING OF, UH,
GETTING BACK INTO POLITICS.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.320
- I DON'T KNOW.
[stammers]

28:57.350 --> 28:58.100
SOMETHING WEIRD HAPPENED,

28:58.150 --> 29:00.004
AND I'M SORT OF THINKING
ABOUT IT,

29:00.040 --> 29:01.905
BUT IT'S...
REMEMBER BOB LITTLE?

29:01.940 --> 29:04.079
REMEMBER THE GUY
I USED TO WORK FOR?

29:04.120 --> 29:05.633
- YEAH.
- WELL, HE'S RUNNING FOR MAYOR.

29:05.670 --> 29:10.391
AND, UM, HE WANTS ME
TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN.

29:10.430 --> 29:12.295
- THIS JUST HAPPENED?
- YEAH, IT JUST HAPPENED.

29:12.330 --> 29:13.945
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
- WHICH IS SUCH AN HONOR.

29:13.990 --> 29:16.083
AND IF HE WINS,
WHICH I THINK HE COULD WIN...

29:16.130 --> 29:18.269
- OKAY.
- HE'D PUT ME IN CHARGE

29:18.300 --> 29:21.167
OF EDUCATION AND, UH...
- THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.929
- I...

29:22.960 --> 29:24.268
ADAM'S NOT REALLY ON BOARD.

29:24.310 --> 29:27.962
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES THE GUY,
SO HE'S KIND OF...

29:28.000 --> 29:30.628
- OKAY, BUT IT'S NOT
REALLY ADAM'S CHOICE.

29:30.660 --> 29:33.276
- THAT'S TRUE.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.594
I JUST DON'T KNOW

29:34.630 --> 29:36.518
IF THIS IS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY
RIGHT NOW TO DO THAT.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.699
I HAVE A SCAN COMING UP.
YOU KNOW HOW SCARY THAT IS.

29:38.740 --> 29:40.833
- KRISTINA, I LOVE YOU,
BUT THAT'S CRAP.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.529
- NO, IT'S NOT CRAP.
- NO, IT IS.

29:42.570 --> 29:43.878
YOU DON'T WAIT.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.912
YOU DON'T WAIT FOR A GOOD SCAN.
DON'T WAIT.

29:46.950 --> 29:48.815
DON'T WAIT FOR ANYTHING.

29:48.850 --> 29:50.886
IF THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO DO,

29:50.920 --> 29:53.127
YOU NEED TO DO IT.

29:53.170 --> 29:55.229
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THIS TAUGHT US,

29:55.270 --> 29:57.329
IT'S NO WAITING.

29:57.380 --> 30:00.235
THIS IS NOT
THE DRESS REHEARSAL.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.828
THIS IS IT.

30:05.010 --> 30:07.319
YOU WANT TO DO THIS...

30:07.350 --> 30:09.523
YOU DO IT.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.215
- SO TELL ME MORE
ABOUT COLLEGE.

30:17.260 --> 30:19.467
I NEED MORE, BECAUSE I HAVE
TO VICARIOUSLY LIVE THROUGH YOU

30:19.500 --> 30:21.058
BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET TO--
- THERE'S NOTHING.

30:21.090 --> 30:22.842
IT'S JUST READING AND SLEEPING
AND EATING.

30:22.890 --> 30:25.393
- HAVE YOU LAID EYES
ON ANY CUTE LADIES

30:25.440 --> 30:27.021
YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT?

30:27.060 --> 30:28.743
- RYAN'S COMING HOME, RIGHT?

30:28.790 --> 30:30.405
ISN'T THAT SOON?
- VERY SMOOTH TRANSITION.

30:30.440 --> 30:31.953
- YEAH.
THANK YOU.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.379
- UM, YES, HE IS.
HE'S COMING HOME.

30:35.410 --> 30:36.752
I FEEL SCARED.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.199
- WHY?

30:38.250 --> 30:39.751
- BECAUSE...
I DON'T KNOW--IT'S LIKE

30:39.800 --> 30:42.200
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO RELATE
TO WHAT HE'S GOING THROUGH,

30:42.250 --> 30:44.104
AND I FEEL LIKE HE'S, LIKE,
KIND OF CLOSED OFF AND STUFF.

30:44.150 --> 30:46.664
AND--I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL NERVOUS,

30:46.700 --> 30:48.008
LIKE...
- UH-HUH.

30:48.050 --> 30:51.463
- LIKE MAYBE
HE DOESN'T LIKE ME ANYMORE.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.388
- HE STILL LIKES YOU.

30:53.430 --> 30:54.704
- I HOPE SO.

30:54.740 --> 30:56.469
- AMBER, IT'LL BE FINE.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.741
I MEAN...

30:58.780 --> 31:01.749
[both chuckle]

31:01.790 --> 31:02.540
I DON'T KNOW.

31:02.580 --> 31:05.856
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WHAT IF HE...

31:05.890 --> 31:08.279
WHAT IF HE STARTS ACTING...
DISTANT?

31:08.310 --> 31:10.130
WHAT IF HE TEXT ME,
YOU KNOW,

31:10.170 --> 31:12.229
SOME SORT OF VAGUE,
BLOW-OFF-Y TEXT LIKE,

31:12.280 --> 31:14.441
"BRB," YOU KNOW,
EMOTICON ART.

31:14.490 --> 31:15.514
- OH, OKAY, YEAH.

31:15.560 --> 31:18.176
MAYBE HE HAS CLASS,

31:18.220 --> 31:20.768
AND MAYBE HE THOUGHT
YOU WERE HIS MOM

31:20.800 --> 31:22.529
WHEN HE WOULD BE DOING THAT
BECAUSE...

31:22.570 --> 31:24.765
- [laughing] I'M SORRY.
- THAT SOUNDS VERY FAMILIAR.

31:24.810 --> 31:25.629
- LISTEN, I'M SORRY
IF YOU'RE ANNOYED,

31:25.670 --> 31:27.774
BUT I NEED YOU
TO HELP ME OUT HERE,

31:27.810 --> 31:28.799
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW MOM IS,

31:28.850 --> 31:31.227
AND WHEN ONE OF US
IS NOT PAYING ATTENTION...

31:31.260 --> 31:33.319
- I KNOW EXACTLY HOW SHE IS.
- SHE GOES TO THE OTHER ONE

31:33.370 --> 31:34.576
AND SUCKS ALL THE ENERGY OUT.
- I'LL TEXT HER.

31:34.610 --> 31:36.020
- JUST GIVE HER A SMALL TREAT,
WOULD YOU?

31:36.060 --> 31:37.402
I'M SERIOUS.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.646
IT'S BAD.

31:40.790 --> 31:42.405
- YOU KNOW,
I'VE ONLY EVER HAD

31:42.450 --> 31:44.657
THE ONE JOB
SINCE GRAD SCHOOL.

31:44.690 --> 31:46.510
I PUT ALL MY EGGS
IN ONE BASKET,

31:46.550 --> 31:49.587
AND NOW THAT LEON IS BEING
VINDICT IVE, I'M SCREWED.

31:49.630 --> 31:50.824
I REALLY...

31:50.870 --> 31:53.725
AND HE DESERVES TO BE,
BECAUSE I MESSED UP.

31:53.770 --> 31:55.453
HE HAS EVERY RIGHT, BUT...
- HONEY, YOU DIDN'T MESS UP.

31:55.490 --> 31:59.142
YOU CHOSE YOUR CHILDREN
OVER YOUR WORK.

31:59.190 --> 31:59.975
[phone vibrating]
- THANK YOU.

32:00.020 --> 32:02.250
- SORRY.
- BUT THAT IS REVISIONIST.

32:02.290 --> 32:05.179
I GOT OVERWHELMED,
AND I SCREWED UP.

32:05.230 --> 32:07.198
- SO SORRY.
- AND, UM...

32:07.230 --> 32:08.743
- HONEY, IT'S--IT'S PEET.
- OH.

32:08.780 --> 32:10.020

32:10.060 --> 32:12.472
- SO SORRY.
HEY, PEET.

32:12.510 --> 32:14.683

32:14.720 --> 32:16.517
YEAH, YEAH.

32:16.550 --> 32:18.438
WE HAD A GREAT TIME TOO.

32:19.590 --> 32:21.899

32:21.940 --> 32:23.373
REALLY?

32:23.420 --> 32:24.512
THAT'S--[laughs]
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

32:24.560 --> 32:27.211
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

32:27.250 --> 32:30.003
WE ARE JUST GONNA--WE ARE GONNA
BUST ASS ON THIS FOR YOU.

32:30.050 --> 32:33.042
I AM NOT GONNA DISAPPOINT YOU.
THIS IS HUGE.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.492
THANK YOU.
UM...

32:35.530 --> 32:37.805
WOW.
8:00 A.M., YEAH.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.435
OKAY. THAN KS.

32:42.470 --> 32:43.573
I GOT IT.

32:43.610 --> 32:45.123

32:45.170 --> 32:46.819
- HONEY, I GOT IT.

32:46.860 --> 32:48.646
- WOW.

32:48.690 --> 32:50.408
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
- OH!

32:50.450 --> 32:52.543
MAN, THIS IS SURREAL.
I JUST...

32:52.590 --> 32:54.512
THIS IS TWO YEARS OF WORK.
I GOT TO CALL BILL.

32:54.550 --> 32:56.859
HE WORKED HIS ASS OFF
ON THAT ESTIMATE.

32:57.970 --> 32:59.312
- HEY, I'M--SORRY, I KNOW
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF--

32:59.350 --> 33:02.239
- I'M FINE.
- OKAY.

33:02.290 --> 33:03.769
- I'M FINE.
WE ARE GOING TO CELEBRATE.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.358
- CELEBRATING.

33:05.390 --> 33:07.870
WILLIAM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT 8:00 AM. TOMORROW?

33:07.910 --> 33:10.219
WE GOT IT, BUDDY.

33:10.260 --> 33:12.012
YES, THE WHOLE JOB.

33:12.050 --> 33:14.701
[shrill beeping]

33:16.540 --> 33:18.405

33:18.440 --> 33:19.338
- HEY.

33:19.370 --> 33:21.406

33:21.440 --> 33:23.954
HEY, CAN YOU PUT THAT OUT,
PLEASE?

33:24.000 --> 33:27.094
- OH, I'M SORRY.
I WAS SMUDGING MY APARTMENT.

33:27.140 --> 33:28.414
- SMUDGING?
- YEAH, JUST--PURIFYING.

33:28.450 --> 33:31.795
UH, BROKE UP
WITH LINCOLN, SO...

33:31.830 --> 33:33.513
- OH, YOU GUYS BROKE UP.
I'M SHOCKED.

33:35.910 --> 33:36.695
[louder beeping]
- THAT--

33:36.730 --> 33:39.802
[loud trilling]
OH, YOU GOT IT.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.047
GOT IT.
SKILLS.

33:42.080 --> 33:43.945
[laughs]

33:43.980 --> 33:44.662
WE COULD BE FRIENDS.

33:44.710 --> 33:47.110
- [laughs] WHAT?
- WE COULD.

33:47.160 --> 33:50.129
IT WOULD NEVER GET WEIRD.
I DON'T DATE WOMEN OVER 30.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.639
- [scoffs]
WELL, THAT'S CONVENIENT,

33:51.680 --> 33:55.332
BECAUSE SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS
ARE 40-YEAR-OLD GUYS

33:55.370 --> 33:57.304
WHO DATE 20-YEAR-OLDS.
- REALLY?

33:57.340 --> 33:59.137
- NO, CARL, NOT REALLY.

33:59.170 --> 34:01.331
- UM, OKAY. DO YOU WANT HELP
WITH THE LADDER OR...

34:01.380 --> 34:03.132
- I'LL GET IT.
- NICE SATCHEL.

34:03.170 --> 34:04.444
- HEY, I'M COMING UP
TO YOUR HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

34:04.490 --> 34:07.277
I'M OUT FRONT.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON!

34:07.320 --> 34:08.344
- WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?
- HEY, HEY, LET'S GO.

34:08.390 --> 34:10.449
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON!

34:10.490 --> 34:11.525
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

34:11.560 --> 34:14.188
- COME ON!
- CROSBY, WHAT THE HELL?

34:14.220 --> 34:15.619
STOP THE CAR.
WHAT IS GOING ON?

34:15.670 --> 34:17.524
- SHH, GET IN, GET IN,
GET IN, GET IN.

34:17.570 --> 34:19.151
- ALL RIGHT!
- QUIETLY, QUIETLY.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.396
SHE JUST WENT--
[door thuds]

34:20.430 --> 34:21.465
SHE JUST FELL ASLEEP!
- OKAY, OKAY.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.671
SORRY.
- SHE WAKES UP, YOU OWN HER!

34:22.710 --> 34:25.463
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WHY ARE
WE DRIVING 2 MILES AN HOUR?

34:25.510 --> 34:27.671
- BECAUSE SHE LIKES THE HUM
AND THE VIBRATION.

34:27.720 --> 34:30.029
SHE DOESN'T LIKE SUDDEN,
UNEXPECT ED NOISES.

34:30.060 --> 34:33.336
ANYTHING SHARP OR SUDDEN WILL
WAKE HER UP, SO JUST KIND OF...

34:33.380 --> 34:34.995
- SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
- YEAH, WELL...

34:35.030 --> 34:37.089
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

34:37.140 --> 34:38.232
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT'S NOT ENOUGH?

34:38.280 --> 34:40.373
- I JUST NEED YOU TO TELL ME
THAT THIS IS TEMPORARY--

34:40.420 --> 34:44.004
THE CRYING AND THE SPITTING UP
AND THE DIARRHEA

34:44.040 --> 34:46.247
AND, YOU KNOW,
THE SLEEP DEPRIVATION.

34:46.290 --> 34:48.497
SHE'S RUINING ME.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

34:48.530 --> 34:50.805
I AM HALF THE PERSON
I WAS THREE DAYS AGO.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.319
- I CANNOT LIVE LIKE THIS.
YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY?

34:52.360 --> 34:54.009
MY HEALTH IS GOING
DOWN THE TOILET RIGHT NOW.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.665
- CROSBY, IT'S TEMPORARY.
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT

34:55.710 --> 34:56.802
LACK OF SLEEP DOES?

34:56.850 --> 34:59.466
IT'S TIED TO DIABETES.
PEOPLE GET DIABETES.

34:59.510 --> 35:00.989
A RING OF FAT AROUND
YOUR STOMACH.

35:01.020 --> 35:02.339
- YOU'RE TIRED.
IT'S GONNA PASS.

35:03.540 --> 35:05.508
IT IS TEMPORARY, OKAY?
SHE'S A BABY.

35:05.550 --> 35:07.575
SHE'S GONNA GROW OUT OF IT.
IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME.

35:07.620 --> 35:09.338
YOU'RE GONNA FALL INTO A RHYTHM

35:09.380 --> 35:10.995
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE
LESS TIRED, OKAY?

35:11.030 --> 35:13.032
- OKAY, BUT YOU--

35:13.070 --> 35:14.719
IT'S NOT JUSTI+TIEIE EXHAUSTION.

35:14.760 --> 35:17.649
- WHAT IS IT?

35:17.700 --> 35:20.100
- I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO ADMIT THIS, BUT...

35:20.150 --> 35:22.175
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.427
I'M WATCHING JASMINE HOLD HER,

35:24.460 --> 35:26.599
AND SHE CLEARLY HAS SOME
CONNECTION THAT I DON'T HAVE.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.972
I'M WAITING FOR THIS WAVE
OF LOVE TO WASH OVER ME,

35:29.020 --> 35:30.669
AND IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING.

35:30.710 --> 35:35.579
DID YOU EXPERIENCE THAT
WITH YOUR KIDS AT ALL?

35:35.610 --> 35:38.477
- NO. I DIDN'T.

35:38.510 --> 35:40.091
- SO I'M JUST--
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

35:40.130 --> 35:41.688
I'M THE WORST PERSON
IN THE WORLD.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.995
- CROSBY, IT'S JUST--
IT'S LIKE JABBAR, OKAY?

35:44.030 --> 35:45.543
YOU LOVE HIM, RIGHT?

35:45.590 --> 35:47.546
KIDS DON'T COME INTO THE WORLD
WALKING AND TALKING.

35:47.590 --> 35:50.206
THIS IS A BABY, ALL RIGHT?
JUST GIVE IT SOME TIME.

35:50.250 --> 35:51.899
- ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE IT SOME TIME.

35:51.940 --> 35:54.522
- MEANWHILE, GET SOME SLEEP.
YOU'LL FEEL A LOT BETTER.

35:54.560 --> 35:55.697
- WELL, EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

35:55.730 --> 35:56.833
I'M GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO SLEEP WHILE I DRIVE.

35:56.870 --> 35:59.566
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A NAP.
LEARN HOW TO TAKE NAPS.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.044
ALL RIGHT? YOU'LL BE FINE.
- THANK YOU.

36:01.080 --> 36:02.559
I'M GONNA HANG A RIGHT
HERE ON ELM.

36:02.600 --> 36:03.328
HOP OUT RIGHT NOW.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.328
I'M GETTING OUT.
I'M GETTING OUT.

36:05.370 --> 36:07.326
WOULD YOU RELAX?
- WATCH YOURSELF.

36:07.370 --> 36:10.259
OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

36:10.300 --> 36:10.880
[door slams]
OH, MY GO--

36:10.920 --> 36:12.501
[baby crying]
SORRY!

36:12.540 --> 36:13.984
- OH, MAN!

36:14.030 --> 36:15.679
[baby crying loudly]

36:23.210 --> 36:25.098
- ANYWAY, HONEY, I DON'T THINK
IT'S UNREALISTIC

36:25.140 --> 36:27.028
THAT MAX COULD HAVE
A LEGITIMATE FUTURE

36:27.080 --> 36:28.001
IN PHOTOGRAPHY.

36:28.040 --> 36:29.416
YOU KNOW, HANK SAID
HE'S GOT A GOOD EYE

36:29.460 --> 36:32.076
AND SEEMS TO GENUINELY
LIKE MAX, SO...

36:32.120 --> 36:33.906
- MM-HMM. YEAH.
- IT WOULD DEFINITELY

36:33.950 --> 36:34.939
BE WEIRD FOR MY SISTER,

36:34.980 --> 36:36.595
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CLEAR IT WITH SARAH,

36:36.640 --> 36:38.528
BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING.

36:38.570 --> 36:40.299
- I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD THING TOO.

36:40.330 --> 36:43.572
- BUT, HONEY, MY HAMMIES
HAVE BEEN SO TIGHT ALL WEEK

36:43.610 --> 36:46.056
EVER SINCE
I WENT ON THAT LONG RUN.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.909
YOU THINK YOU COULD, UH...

36:47.960 --> 36:49.473
GIVE ME A LITTLE HELP?

36:49.510 --> 36:50.613
STRETCH OUT THE OLD HAMMIES?

36:50.650 --> 36:53.027
HUH?
I'LL STRETCH OUT YOUR HAMMIES.

36:53.070 --> 36:54.890
- OKAY.
- HMM?

36:54.930 --> 36:57.649
- HEY, ADAM, I, UM--
I WANTED TO ASK YOU.

36:57.690 --> 36:59.999
YOU KNOW HOW YOU WERE
TALKING TO ME ABOUT BOB LITTLE,

37:00.040 --> 37:01.029
AND YOU WERE LIKE,
"OH, DON'T GO TO WORK FOR HIM."

37:01.080 --> 37:03.457
- HONEY, I THOUGHT WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

37:03.490 --> 37:05.481
I THOUGHT WE SHUT THIS DOWN.
- AND I'M AGREEING WITH YOU.

37:05.530 --> 37:07.839
I THINK THAT--YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO WORK

37:07.880 --> 37:10.110
FOR SOMEBODY THAT I DON'T
RESPECT AND I DON'T ADMIRE,

37:10.150 --> 37:12.152
SO I'VE DECIDED
NOT TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN.

37:12.190 --> 37:15.079
- EXCELLENT.
- HOWEVER...

37:15.120 --> 37:17.327
I HAVE DECIDED
TO RUN AGAINST HIM.

37:18.820 --> 37:19.741
- [laughs]
WHAT?

37:19.780 --> 37:22.169
- I'M GONNA RUN
FOR MAYOR OF BERKELEY.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.124
- KRISTINA,
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

37:25.170 --> 37:26.398
- I'M SERIOUS.

37:26.450 --> 37:27.474
THINK ABOUT IT.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.659
I MEAN, I'VE GONE TO WORK
FOR THESE PEOPLE BEFORE.

37:29.690 --> 37:31.487
WHY NOT DO IT FOR MYSELF?
- KRISTINA--

37:31.520 --> 37:33.272
- YOU KEEP SAYING TO ME...
- I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED

37:33.320 --> 37:36.699
IN POLITICS, BUT YOU'VE
NEVER RUN FOR AN OFFICE.

37:36.730 --> 37:37.697
- AND THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME.
- CERTAINLY NOT

37:37.730 --> 37:38.833
A MAJOR OFFICE
LIKE THE MAYOR OF BERKELEY.

37:38.870 --> 37:41.282
- THIS IS THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, ADAM.

37:41.320 --> 37:42.389
AND TALKING WITH GWEN
LAST NIGHT--

37:42.430 --> 37:43.943
- ALL RIGHT, KRISTINA, STOP.
I GET IT, I GET IT.

37:43.980 --> 37:45.561
YOU'RE CHARGED UP.
YOU WANT TO SEIZE THE DAY.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.397
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHETHER THIS IS REALISTIC.

37:47.430 --> 37:49.079
- IT'S MORE THAN THAT, ADAM.
- IS THIS THE BEST TIME

37:49.120 --> 37:50.257
TO DO THIS?
- OF COURSE NOT.

37:50.300 --> 37:52.700
IT'S NOT THE BEST TIME
TO DO THIS.

37:52.750 --> 37:54.433
NO. I WANT NORA TO BE
A LITTLE BIT OLDER.

37:54.470 --> 37:55.607
YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE CRAZY,
AND THEY'RE CHAOTIC...

37:55.650 --> 37:57.402
- I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TAKE
A LITTLE MORE TIME SINCE--

37:57.440 --> 37:59.431
- THEY'RE SCATTERED.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.641
I WANT TO HAVE, LIKE,
A THOUSAND CLEAN SCANS.

38:01.690 --> 38:04.545
I WANT TO BE CURED.
I WANT MAX TO BE THRIVING.

38:04.590 --> 38:06.558
I WANT OUR MARRIAGE
TO BE EVEN BETTER.

38:06.590 --> 38:08.273
IT'S GREAT, BUT I--
- RIGHT. ME TOO.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.799
SO WE SHOULD WAIT.
YOU SHOULD START SMALLER.

38:09.830 --> 38:12.003
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA WAIT.
THIS IS A GOOD TIME.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.315
I'M NOT GONNA WAIT.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.497
- KRISTINA--
- I WANT TO DO THIS.

38:15.530 --> 38:17.805
SO...
- EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO DO THIS,

38:17.840 --> 38:19.592
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME SORT
OF A DEADLINE FOR FILING.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.039
- THERE IS.
- YOU CAN'T JUST--

38:21.090 --> 38:23.945
- IT'S TOMORROW AT NOON.

38:23.990 --> 38:26.436
- THIS IS REAL.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.462
- THIS IS REAL.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.649
- I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S BI-RACIAL, HONEY.

38:34.690 --> 38:36.510
I THINK SHE'S BI-SPECIES.

38:36.550 --> 38:38.927
SHE'S HALF-WORM, HALF-HUMAN.

38:38.970 --> 38:42.269
- [murmuring]

38:42.320 --> 38:46.177
OOH, SHE IS A DIFFICULT
BABY, THOUGH.

38:46.220 --> 38:49.109
- YEAH.

38:49.150 --> 38:50.594
[laughs]

38:50.630 --> 38:53.349
- LIKE WORSE THAN JABBAR WAS?
- OH, WAY WORSE.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.288
- THAT'S WEIRDLY COMFORTING.

38:55.330 --> 38:57.150
- [laughs]

38:57.190 --> 38:59.249
MM. BUT I'M JUST
SO IN LOVE WITH HER.

38:59.300 --> 39:00.289

I FEEL SO CONNECTED.

39:00.330 --> 39:02.776

39:05.580 --> 39:10.335

39:41.720 --> 39:44.473
[indistinct conversation]

39:44.520 --> 39:46.476
