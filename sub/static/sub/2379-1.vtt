<i>Put a bullet in a monster.
That was supposed to be our war.</i>

00:29.094 --> 00:31.902
<i>But you better know your enemy.</i>

00:36.902 --> 00:38.726
<i>I never wanted to be a soldier.</i>

00:40.639 --> 00:43.343
<i>But what else was I gonna do?</i>

00:44.343 --> 00:48.145
<i>Shift rubble and deal crack?</i>

00:48.146 --> 00:51.352
<i>Fuck that.</i>

00:53.352 --> 00:56.793
<i>So when the army came looking I signed up.</i>

01:01.793 --> 01:03.897
<i>Now it's my blood.</i>

01:05.497 --> 01:08.232
<i>The monsters out there have
been walking through cities.</i>

01:08.233 --> 01:14.639
<i>Smashing 'em down. So air strike's been
hittin' them hard to clear 'em out.</i>

01:14.640 --> 01:16.907
<i>Make the world safe.</i>

01:16.908 --> 01:22.312
<i>Trouble was all those bombs
had torn up the locals, too.</i>

01:22.313 --> 01:24.214
<i>And that just made
a whole lot more insurgents</i>

01:24.215 --> 01:25.804
<i>just wanna fucking kill us.</i>

01:28.687 --> 01:33.958
<i>So the troops on the ground,
we're out there taking them down.</i>

01:33.959 --> 01:38.367
<i>Stop them gettin' in the way of us
bombing the monsters back to hell.</i>

01:43.286 --> 01:45.169
<i>Sergeant Frater was one of them.</i>

01:45.170 --> 01:49.342
<i>They worked him undercover in deep IZ.</i>

01:50.342 --> 01:53.046
<i>He killed a lot of people.</i>

01:54.046 --> 01:56.180
<i>There it was.</i>

01:56.181 --> 01:57.861
<i>He was a fuckin' lion.</i>

03:48.560 --> 03:51.229
Hands! Let me see your hands!

03:53.532 --> 03:54.885
- Down!
- On your knees!

03:55.500 --> 03:58.067
Hands on your head, interlock your ankles.

03:58.068 --> 03:59.303
Do not move.

03:59.304 --> 04:01.111
Check the vehicle.

04:07.111 --> 04:10.053
They have clearance.
Sir, welcome to Camp Renegade.

04:55.927 --> 04:59.365
<i>Going on right now through
outer space community.</i>

05:00.365 --> 05:01.965
<i>Fragments of the satellite</i>

05:01.966 --> 05:04.202
<i>have been found in the Middle East.</i>

06:02.259 --> 06:07.572
<i>We will fight those who oppose peace
in this world, human or otherwise.</i>

06:33.992 --> 06:36.193
<i>I never had a family growing up.</i>

06:36.194 --> 06:39.432
<i>Only thing here for me was my boys.</i>

06:41.432 --> 06:44.600
<i>But none of us wanted to stay in Detroit.</i>

06:44.601 --> 06:49.444
<i>We've been roaming around here like
stray dogs since we were kids.</i>

06:53.444 --> 06:56.612
<i>Now we're being shipped out together.</i>

06:56.613 --> 06:59.116
Hey, man. You all right?

06:59.117 --> 07:02.120
<i>Closest thing I got to family is Frankie.</i>

07:04.255 --> 07:05.621
Frankie home?

07:05.622 --> 07:06.722
<i>When I was small,</i>

07:06.723 --> 07:08.659
<i>every time I'd skip out on my foster home,</i>

07:08.660 --> 07:11.227
<i>I'd climb through
Frankie's window and hide out.</i>

07:11.228 --> 07:13.429
<i>He was like a brother.</i>

07:13.430 --> 07:16.066
- Frankie, come on, man.
- Shit!

07:16.067 --> 07:17.600
Hey, Mikey. 'Sup, buddy.

07:17.601 --> 07:19.169
- 'Sup, Mike.
- 'Sup, Leena.

07:19.170 --> 07:21.338
<i>He can be a dick sometimes.</i>

07:21.339 --> 07:23.306
Y'all hanging Aces tonight?
<i>If anyone fucked with me...</i>

07:23.307 --> 07:24.374
Probably just a house party.

07:24.375 --> 07:26.542
<i>Frankie would take a bat to him.</i>

07:26.543 --> 07:27.778
You should hit up, Stacey.
You know she's been asking about you.

07:27.779 --> 07:29.246
- Oh, yeah?
- That's a good idea.

07:29.247 --> 07:31.189
Frankie, come on! We're late, man.

07:31.389 --> 07:34.051
Give you something to remember while
you're out there killing alien invaders!

07:34.052 --> 07:37.087
<i>We wanted our war...
and we were gonna get one.</i>

07:37.088 --> 07:41.025
<i>We were gonna have the best fuckin'
fight of our lives.</i>

07:41.026 --> 07:43.029
What do you want?

07:45.029 --> 07:48.265
Breathe, baby, breathe.

07:48.266 --> 07:51.357
- It's...
- Breathe, baby.

08:12.357 --> 08:15.564
Shh...

08:22.834 --> 08:25.504
It's your daddy, what's up? What's up, kid?

08:27.504 --> 08:30.174
Aww, he don't like me. He don't like me.

08:30.175 --> 08:32.409
It's OK. It's all right.

08:32.409 --> 08:34.177
Take him.

08:34.178 --> 08:36.080
You drop him, I'm gonna smack
the shit out you, you know that?

08:36.081 --> 08:37.780
Watch your mouth around my child.

08:37.782 --> 08:39.482
He don't understand.

08:39.484 --> 08:42.318
I ain't having nothing
vulgar around my angel.

08:42.320 --> 08:46.422
- Mm-hmm.
- No daggers of the devil that will pierce his heart or soul.

08:46.423 --> 08:48.292
- You understand me now?
- OK.

08:48.293 --> 08:51.095
My warrior, with arrows in his hands.

08:51.096 --> 08:53.129
Preach, baby, preach.
You know what I'm saying?

08:53.130 --> 08:56.566
They will not be ashamed when they
meet their enemies in the gate.

08:56.567 --> 09:01.638
- Amen, sister. Amen.
- Amen, brother.

09:01.639 --> 09:04.608
Yo, Seanie,
you got everything squared away here, man?

09:04.808 --> 09:05.776
Good to go?

09:05.777 --> 09:08.311
Where? Where are you going?

09:08.312 --> 09:10.446
Nowhere, just gonna go kick it, that's it.

09:10.447 --> 09:12.367
- Shut up, Frankie.
- You're gonna kick it today?

09:12.517 --> 09:14.451
- Yeah, I was planning...
- Sean...

09:14.452 --> 09:16.253
It's the last night before we deploy...

09:16.254 --> 09:18.254
You're going to have to start
acting like a damn father.

09:18.255 --> 09:19.755
My boys wanna take me out.
I don't see what the big deal is.

09:19.756 --> 09:20.891
All I'm saying is
you're coming and you're going.

09:20.892 --> 09:23.292
You're coming and you're going.

09:23.293 --> 09:24.728
- One day you'll come back and find we ain't gonna be here.
- You always on that bullshit.

09:24.729 --> 09:26.396
You always on that
bullshit, like your mama.

09:26.397 --> 09:27.498
- I'm just sayin', one day...
- Chill, man, Kelly...

09:27.499 --> 09:28.632
we ain't gonna be here.

09:28.633 --> 09:29.966
Come on...

09:29.967 --> 09:32.268
<i>We had all grown up in
the same neighborhood,</i>

09:32.269 --> 09:35.739
<i>but I met Williams and Inks in training.</i>

09:35.740 --> 09:40.377
<i>And since we got put in the same unit,
it went beyond friendship.</i>

09:40.378 --> 09:42.713
Just wanted his daddy, dog, that's it.

09:42.714 --> 09:44.681
<i>Our lives were in each other's hands.</i>

09:44.682 --> 09:47.216
We're going to bring
Seanie back, all right.

09:47.217 --> 09:48.551
He's cool, we got his back.

09:48.552 --> 09:50.220
Yeah, well,
you need to tell him he got a reason

09:50.221 --> 09:53.223
to get his black backside here early.

09:53.224 --> 09:55.926
Now you go. Go on and rest, all right.

09:55.927 --> 09:57.827
- He's beautiful.
- I know.

09:57.828 --> 09:59.167
Come on, men.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.201
What's the matter, baby? What's the matter?

10:04.202 --> 10:06.202
I just want you to come back early.

10:06.504 --> 10:07.738
I will.

10:07.739 --> 10:10.474
- You know that.
- Mm-hmm.

10:10.475 --> 10:12.510
Look what we did.

10:13.510 --> 10:16.479
Yeah, look what I did.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.449
I know, I know.

10:19.450 --> 10:21.587
You went and made me a son.

10:23.587 --> 10:26.355
Big boy, you strong, ain't you? Strong.

10:26.356 --> 10:28.659
Protect your mama while I'm gone, OK?

10:48.745 --> 10:52.548
You know I got your back out there,
though, right?

10:52.549 --> 10:54.850
- Out there? You fucking kidding me?
- What?

10:54.851 --> 10:57.487
I'm always the one
that's got your fucking back.

10:57.488 --> 11:00.224
Remember that kid who used to
always beat on you in school?

11:00.225 --> 11:03.460
- Connor Clancy.
- Yeah. What about him?

11:03.461 --> 11:04.760
The hockey game.

11:04.761 --> 11:06.964
You scored the winner
and you were celebrating.

11:06.965 --> 11:08.731
He was calling you a...
You know, whatever...

11:08.732 --> 11:10.501
Called me a "welfare baby".

11:11.501 --> 11:12.970
You lost your shit, man.

11:12.971 --> 11:16.340
Started... tearing, biting at him.

11:16.341 --> 11:20.244
Clancy, he's just laughing at you, bro.

11:20.245 --> 11:22.979
That's when I have to come in
with a fucking hockey stick...

11:22.980 --> 11:24.848
Takes two dads to pull you off...

11:24.849 --> 11:26.883
Fucking go to work on the little prick.

11:26.884 --> 11:29.319
By the time I'm finished, he's lying
in a pool of his own piss and blood.

11:29.519 --> 11:33.824
- Hmm.
- Never looked you in the eye again though.

11:33.825 --> 11:35.625
That's a long time ago, man.

11:35.626 --> 11:38.831
You ain't no welfare baby, Mike.
You got a family.

11:39.831 --> 11:42.370
Fuck anybody says you don't.

11:45.370 --> 11:46.871
Oh, fuck.

11:52.777 --> 11:55.012
- Shit.
- Yeah!

11:55.013 --> 11:57.614
- Got him!
- Hey, man.

11:57.615 --> 11:59.923
How do you like that...?

12:06.923 --> 12:09.459
And the crowd goes wild!

12:09.460 --> 12:11.494
<i>People don't get it.</i>

12:11.495 --> 12:13.763
<i>They don't get what courage is.</i>

12:13.764 --> 12:16.399
<i>We'd all die for each other.</i>

12:16.400 --> 12:18.668
<i>And we could all stay in the same places,</i>

12:18.669 --> 12:21.838
<i>in the same fucking bar
and have a few laughs.</i>

12:21.839 --> 12:24.907
<i>And not being nobody the rest of our lives.</i>

12:24.908 --> 12:28.422
<i>But we wanted to come back with a story.</i>

12:37.422 --> 12:40.059
Fuck this place, man.

12:42.059 --> 12:44.661
<i>This was our home.</i>

12:44.662 --> 12:47.596
<i>It was our last day.</i>

12:47.597 --> 12:51.803
<i>So for those last few hours we needed
to forget about what was coming.</i>

12:52.803 --> 12:55.347
<i>We just go tear the fucking place down.</i>

13:31.509 --> 13:33.916
- Get him, boy!
- Get him, get him.

13:38.916 --> 13:40.388
Shit!

13:48.024 --> 13:50.554
Fuckin' bring it on, man!
Come on, bring it!

14:00.671 --> 14:03.116
Shit!

14:13.116 --> 14:15.234
Get the fuck out the way! Move, move!

14:19.791 --> 14:21.927
Come on, get the fuck out of here.

14:22.927 --> 14:24.594
Mike!

14:24.595 --> 14:26.863
Fuck this, let's bounce
before the Feds come.

14:26.864 --> 14:29.132
What the fuck you mad for?
You put your dollar on...

14:29.133 --> 14:30.901
You deserve to lose.

14:30.902 --> 14:32.869
Everybody lost. What's
the point of having a fight,

14:32.870 --> 14:34.470
if you're gonna shoot the fucking winner?

14:34.504 --> 14:36.038
No, I get it, man,
I get it, you love the monster.

14:36.039 --> 14:38.108
- Fuck you.
- No, you love that little monster pussy.

14:38.109 --> 14:40.844
You wanna pick it up around eight,
take it to a nice restaurant,

14:40.845 --> 14:43.113
maybe a glass of wine, catch a movie,

14:43.114 --> 14:45.681
walk it home...
finger that bitch on the porch.

14:45.682 --> 14:48.484
- Fuck off...
- Gonna go get your sister.

14:48.485 --> 14:50.887
I'm just saying, why drop the hammer?

14:50.888 --> 14:53.924
Gotta give the crowd what they want, baby.
Blood.

16:22.947 --> 16:24.771
Let's make love, not war, baby.

16:26.650 --> 16:28.812
Pow...

17:07.625 --> 17:10.626
Man, look at the size
of them, motherfuckers.

17:10.627 --> 17:13.095
They're right on your nose, sir.
They're at nine o'clock.

17:13.096 --> 17:17.240
<i>Requesting air strike.</i>

17:41.057 --> 17:45.095
Hey, yo...
There's a lot of bitches arming up.

17:45.096 --> 17:47.063
One of them...

17:47.064 --> 17:51.835
Look like giant fuckin' sand crabs, man.

17:51.836 --> 17:57.307
Firebomb one of those, you'll burn up
a whole lot of hodgie's women, man!

18:38.949 --> 18:40.836
Whoo!

19:02.038 --> 19:05.088
<i>Battle damage assessment: 100 percent.</i>

19:18.088 --> 19:21.832
I want all these Humvees
cleaned out by 0800.

19:27.832 --> 19:31.101
I am Staff Sergeant Frater,
this is Sergeant Forrest.

19:31.102 --> 19:33.770
Area team leaders, welcome to the IZ.

19:38.833 --> 19:42.010
That is the sound of air strikes
hitting monster herds.

19:42.011 --> 19:44.316
It could happen any time of day.

19:45.316 --> 19:48.418
You didn't choose to come here on vacation.

19:48.419 --> 19:52.756
Make yourself at home.
This is now your normal.

19:52.757 --> 19:56.025
Everyone of you is going to
have to make decisions

19:56.026 --> 19:57.893
there is no right answer to.

19:57.894 --> 20:02.065
You have the gift of aggression
and you will have to act.

20:02.066 --> 20:05.070
Do not let your emotions control you.

20:07.070 --> 20:09.182
Sergeant Forrest.

20:18.782 --> 20:22.152
Now I'm going to break it down to
you like you're in kindergarten.

20:22.153 --> 20:24.953
We have Goliaths imbedded
in built up areas.

20:24.954 --> 20:28.825
We bomb them, there's collateral
and the hodgies get real pissed.

20:28.826 --> 20:33.195
So what we're dealing with is IEDs,
suicide bombers,

20:33.196 --> 20:35.431
rocket-grenade attacks and ambush.

20:35.432 --> 20:38.934
Now we will take down monsters
when we encounter them,

20:38.935 --> 20:43.472
but our main focus is to close
down this insurgent activity.

20:43.473 --> 20:46.976
That means recon in non-permissive areas,

20:46.977 --> 20:49.813
and maintaining contact with the locals.

20:49.814 --> 20:54.883
Now, when you're not in the shit, you keep
your gear, your rifle and your balls clean.

20:54.884 --> 20:58.893
Your body and your rifle
are a one-weapon system.

21:02.893 --> 21:04.960
Now I'm not going to lie to you.

21:04.961 --> 21:09.373
I think you're a bunch of... weird-looking,
ugly, raggedy ass motherfuckers.

21:13.002 --> 21:15.339
Stand up, private.

21:15.939 --> 21:18.309
- You're tall, ain't you?
- Yes, sergeant.

21:18.509 --> 21:22.614
Standing up there all tall,
looking like JJ out of <i> Good Times.</i>

21:23.614 --> 21:25.117
Sit down.

21:28.075 --> 21:30.252
And you, you sad-looking motherfucker.

21:30.253 --> 21:32.221
What's wrong with you looking all sad?

21:32.222 --> 21:36.425
Like you was wishin'
you was in team <i> My Little Pony.</i>

21:36.426 --> 21:38.393
We are not.

21:38.394 --> 21:41.365
You are part of team Tiger Shark.

21:42.365 --> 21:43.300
Conway.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.401
On your feet.

21:45.402 --> 21:47.970
- Who are we?
- Tiger Shark!

21:47.971 --> 21:50.006
- I said, who are we?
- Tiger Shark!

21:50.007 --> 21:53.276
- Who hunts and kills all the prey?
- - Tiger shark!

21:53.277 --> 21:54.880
Hooah!

21:59.916 --> 22:01.916
Hey, Rodney Peete... 4th down baby.

22:02.119 --> 22:04.187
Rodney Peete?
How the fuck old are you, sergeant?

22:04.188 --> 22:06.456
Old enough to be your daddy, bitch.

22:06.457 --> 22:10.987
- Whatever, man.
- But your mama not good-looking enough for you to be my son.

22:11.595 --> 22:15.434
Get open! Where you at, man, get open!

22:18.434 --> 22:21.037
- Get off me!
- Who are you talking to?

22:21.038 --> 22:22.438
Talk about my mama again, man.

22:22.439 --> 22:24.406
You stay... you stay where you are.

22:24.407 --> 22:26.276
Remember who you're talking to.

22:26.277 --> 22:28.411
- You watch yourself.
- I'm watching, man.

22:28.412 --> 22:30.947
- Remember who I am.
- I know who you are, man.

22:30.948 --> 22:32.547
- What you gonna do?
- You wanna try that on me?

22:32.548 --> 22:34.150
Man, I'm from Detroit.
What the fuck you gonna do to me?

22:34.151 --> 22:35.351
- You wanna try...
- What you gonna do to me?

22:35.352 --> 22:37.185
Say that again! Say that again!

22:37.186 --> 22:39.188
- Come on! Come on!
- Keep left!

22:39.189 --> 22:40.489
Come on, man. What are you doing, man?

22:40.490 --> 22:42.029
Get the...

22:46.029 --> 22:48.364
My nigga, my rookie.

22:48.365 --> 22:52.067
That's the fire.
That's the fire, right there.

22:52.068 --> 22:54.538
We need that out on the field.

23:16.026 --> 23:21.998
"The thumb stays in the ass while
other fingers roam the front.

23:21.999 --> 23:26.368
I wonder if this is what
being tied up is all about?

23:26.369 --> 23:32.374
The insanely sensual and erotic
feeling of being wide open,

23:32.375 --> 23:37.279
so vulnerable, and absolutely

23:37.280 --> 23:41.183
urgently craving a wild

23:41.184 --> 23:45.055
and unrelenting fucking..."

23:49.359 --> 23:52.295
Goddamn, Sergeant Forrest.

23:52.296 --> 23:55.163
Your wife has got a way with words, man.

23:55.164 --> 23:57.299
Did she write this shit
about her boyfriend?

23:57.300 --> 24:00.303
- Look at them tig 'ol bitties.
- I'm trying to drive, kid. Come on, man.

24:00.503 --> 24:02.604
My woman's not fucking around on me.

24:02.605 --> 24:05.674
One word: Sybian.

24:05.675 --> 24:07.643
Sybi... what the fuck?

24:07.644 --> 24:12.347
Eight point five inches,
two inch rubber attachment. Floor mounted.

24:12.348 --> 24:17.053
Zero point five-nine horsepower, 6,500 RPM.

24:17.054 --> 24:20.690
She saddles up. Powerful vibrations.

24:20.691 --> 24:23.793
It comes in pink and black. I went black.

24:23.794 --> 24:25.428
Yo, you serious?

24:25.429 --> 24:27.095
What, you mean, you didn't

24:27.096 --> 24:29.297
buy your boyfriend a fuck replacement?

24:29.298 --> 24:32.168
- Shit.
- Shit.

24:32.169 --> 24:35.758
- Man, you?
- Dog, I bought your sister a pregnancy test, man.

25:01.097 --> 25:03.337
Pull it over, Williams.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.586
This is not good.

25:26.656 --> 25:29.403
Jesus...

25:39.403 --> 25:42.270
<i>It was our first patrol.</i>

25:42.271 --> 25:44.406
This corner shop belongs to the people

25:44.407 --> 25:45.775
who run this street, on the other side.

25:45.776 --> 25:46.809
The two guys here?

25:46.810 --> 25:48.743
<i>I think we were all scared.</i>

25:48.744 --> 25:51.518
<i>Anyone said they weren't
was a fuckin' liar.</i>

25:54.518 --> 25:58.695
<i>And nobody wanted their family to get
a knock on the door after day one.</i>

25:59.823 --> 26:03.392
<i>But they were easing us in.</i>

26:03.393 --> 26:06.394
<i>We needed to get out there and
build up trust with the locals.</i>

26:06.395 --> 26:10.232
Maguire, you tell Charlie,
keep your head on a swivel.

26:10.233 --> 26:12.436
You're watching our six.

26:13.436 --> 26:15.337
Come here.

26:15.338 --> 26:17.806
OK, what's your name?

26:17.807 --> 26:20.175
Ali. OK, I've seen you before.

26:20.176 --> 26:22.245
Let's take a nice picture
of you, all right.

26:22.246 --> 26:23.516
OK, good.

26:25.516 --> 26:27.482
That's it. Look down the camera.

26:27.483 --> 26:28.617
All right.

26:28.618 --> 26:30.219
- Good. Good.
- You a good boy?

26:30.220 --> 26:31.887
All right, I want you
to stay a good boy. OK?

26:31.888 --> 26:37.727
OK, kids here. Heads up.
Watch your weapons, watch your sidearms.

26:37.728 --> 26:39.863
Hello. Hey.

26:45.368 --> 26:47.269
I'll take it here, all right?

26:47.270 --> 26:50.339
Yeah? Peace signs, you like peace?

27:01.952 --> 27:06.464
You a good boy? You behave yourself?

27:15.464 --> 27:18.403
How we doin', Parkes?

27:26.309 --> 27:27.839
Just form up, get on line.

27:28.578 --> 27:29.679
Link up!

27:29.680 --> 27:32.323
Heads up! Formation! Heads up!

27:39.323 --> 27:44.671
<i>I wanted to protect them, but it already
felt like a losing ballgame here.</i>

27:54.671 --> 27:56.806
Renegade, Tiger One.

27:56.807 --> 27:59.874
Possible signature activity
at target location.

27:59.875 --> 28:01.743
Standby for confirmation.

28:01.744 --> 28:03.412
<i>Copy.</i>

28:03.413 --> 28:04.779
We probably blew the shit out of

28:04.780 --> 28:06.952
their main water supply last night.

28:08.952 --> 28:12.255
We should hang back for more recon.

28:12.256 --> 28:15.080
Those are the same containers
they use for IED's.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.862
We wait 'til nightfall,
we go down, take a closer look.

28:19.863 --> 28:21.663
We finish this now.

28:21.664 --> 28:23.641
Copy that.

28:30.641 --> 28:34.910
Monsters surround, but
they ain't scaring me

28:34.911 --> 28:38.413
In the land of sand,
where they only speak Ara-be

28:38.414 --> 28:41.483
Far from home, I know they be missin' me

28:41.484 --> 28:44.987
My girl on the phone is dreamin'
of kissin' me

28:44.988 --> 28:48.423
Out here with Sergeant Forrest,
he ain't no Gump

28:48.424 --> 28:52.327
Got my rifle in my hand makin'
motherfuckers jump

28:52.328 --> 28:57.033
From the D, you know, hoes and thugs

28:57.034 --> 29:01.539
Lay it down like a king,
chasin' giant sand bugs

29:03.539 --> 29:06.446
Still looking good from over watch.

29:43.046 --> 29:46.582
Renegade, three fighting-aged males
approaching, I'll stick to them.

29:46.583 --> 29:48.351
Get something in the air.

29:48.352 --> 29:50.585
<i>Roger, sir. Good copy.</i>

29:50.586 --> 29:52.421
<i>Talk, too, One-Zero-One</i>

29:52.422 --> 29:55.128
I got movement.
Target 20 meters to your right.

29:55.959 --> 29:58.361
Stay back! Do not come any closer!

29:58.362 --> 30:00.762
Stay back!

30:00.763 --> 30:02.065
Get out of here now!

30:05.736 --> 30:08.002
Do you understand that now?

30:08.003 --> 30:09.873
Do not fucking move!

30:13.576 --> 30:16.945
- OK, OK, OK.
- Open his jacket. Very slowly.

30:16.946 --> 30:19.015
Open his jacket right now.

30:28.023 --> 30:32.164
I have a clean shot.
What's going on down there?

30:35.047 --> 30:37.165
All right, he's clean. Do not engage.

30:37.166 --> 30:40.641
Copy that.

30:44.577 --> 30:46.107
What the fuck's he saying?

30:46.108 --> 30:49.612
OK, this is his farm. He's a farmer.

30:49.613 --> 30:52.517
He says he has lost
his children and his family.

30:53.312 --> 30:56.018
He says the bombs killed his
cattle last night.

30:56.019 --> 30:57.553
All right.

30:57.554 --> 31:00.055
You tell him I understand.
We regret his losses.

31:00.056 --> 31:01.624
We're here to improve his situation.

31:01.625 --> 31:04.449
He was given a chance to evacuate.
They all were.

31:11.601 --> 31:13.868
He says, "Improve?
You don't improve the situation.

31:13.869 --> 31:16.634
Do they fire rockets at your children?"
he says.

31:28.351 --> 31:30.885
He says, "Who asked you to come here?
You have supplies.

31:30.886 --> 31:32.522
Do we have fighting you?"

31:33.122 --> 31:35.825
Are there insurgents here?
Are there insurgents here?

31:35.826 --> 31:37.532
Ask him now.

31:43.387 --> 31:46.035
He says if he speaks
they will cut his throat.

31:46.036 --> 31:49.872
He says, "Listen to me.
All of you listen to me."

31:49.873 --> 31:52.240
Shut him up. Shut him up right now.

31:52.241 --> 31:55.478
He says, "This is my place."

31:55.479 --> 31:58.780
He says, "This is my land.
You cannot remove me from here," he says.

31:58.781 --> 32:02.585
He says, "You cannot remove me,
and you cannot remove the monsters."

32:02.586 --> 32:04.953
OK, he says, "They are under the Earth,
with the dirt."

32:04.954 --> 32:07.837
Shut him up!
He's becoming a motherfucking hazard!

32:13.630 --> 32:14.764
Sergeant...

32:14.765 --> 32:18.868
<i>please advise... north of your location.</i>

32:23.772 --> 32:25.616
<i>Fifty meters...</i>

32:33.616 --> 32:35.755
Shut up! Shut him up!

32:38.755 --> 32:39.923
Back up!

32:40.923 --> 32:42.725
Back the fuck up!

32:42.726 --> 32:46.095
Get him quiet! Deal with him!

32:46.096 --> 32:47.534
Back the fuck up!

32:50.534 --> 32:53.007
What the fuck are you doing?

32:57.007 --> 32:58.740
Get on line!

32:58.741 --> 33:01.320
On line!

33:11.320 --> 33:14.260
Shotguns!

33:18.260 --> 33:19.772
Fire!

33:29.772 --> 33:32.214
Fuckin' love this shit!

33:39.214 --> 33:41.350
<i>Two one, you have green light.</i>

33:41.351 --> 33:46.096
<i>Target, MTR, in range. Fire in the hole.</i>

33:58.869 --> 34:02.070
- Fuckin' saved your life.
- That's fuckin' bullshit, right there.

34:02.071 --> 34:03.071
I know that.

34:14.918 --> 34:16.954
You have fun out there, guys?

34:18.954 --> 34:20.321
Yeah?

34:20.322 --> 34:21.822
Does anybody wanna explain to me

34:21.824 --> 34:24.792
why nobody got eyes on that civilian?

34:24.793 --> 34:27.328
On another day he's a walking bomb!

34:27.329 --> 34:31.833
These people are smart.
They are used to fighting a superior force.

34:31.835 --> 34:33.668
They will engage!

34:33.670 --> 34:36.772
Now I don't wanna be wrapped
in stars and strips

34:36.773 --> 34:39.107
because you're not doing your fucking job!

34:39.108 --> 34:44.284
Concentrate! Put your fucking bottle down!

34:48.284 --> 34:52.286
Maguire, watch your fucking step!
I will fuck you up!

34:52.288 --> 34:58.429
Now I got a daughter back home, and I
can't have her father think about that.

34:59.429 --> 35:01.196
Parkes, look at me!

35:01.197 --> 35:04.299
You say a fucking word,
I'll smash a rifle in your face,

35:04.300 --> 35:08.002
see how you fucking like it!

35:08.003 --> 35:12.741
There is a code of conduct out here.
You will honor it.

35:12.742 --> 35:17.279
This war is real.
Get that in your fucking heads, right now!

35:17.280 --> 35:18.913
You understand that?!

35:18.914 --> 35:22.291
Get it in your head, right fucking now!

35:37.595 --> 35:40.301
Boom!
Boom backed that fuckin' thing right out!

35:40.302 --> 35:43.404
- Fuckin' A.
- That's exactly what we came here for, Mikey-boy.

35:43.405 --> 35:46.808
- Killing monsters, baby! Whoo!
- Damn.

35:46.809 --> 35:49.398
Did you see my... got
to work on that fucker?

36:04.226 --> 36:07.129
We wasn't like that when
we was kids, right?

36:07.130 --> 36:08.954
Oh, man, when we first started.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.202
You were.

36:15.472 --> 36:18.177
It's like they're taking
them off the street.

36:22.177 --> 36:26.182
Maybe the sounds of mortar rounds
not putting you to sleep anymore.

36:27.182 --> 36:30.154
Maybe you need the sounds of home.

36:31.154 --> 36:33.324
See your little girl.

36:35.324 --> 36:38.026
Are you fucking serious?

36:38.027 --> 36:40.129
What, are you going soft on me?

36:40.130 --> 36:44.034
Me? Soft?

36:46.034 --> 36:51.105
Listen, the last time I was home
me and my wife fucked so hard...

36:51.106 --> 36:53.808
the neighbors called the police.

36:53.809 --> 36:57.279
I'm serious. The dog was wailing.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.448
Lights going on up and down the street.

36:59.449 --> 37:03.986
Car alarms sounding.
Local TV crew came to watch.

37:03.987 --> 37:06.788
That was some night.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.860
I'm telling you that, right now.

37:10.860 --> 37:12.166
Oh...

37:16.166 --> 37:17.869
Maybe that's what you need.

37:20.869 --> 37:23.242
I'm all right, pour me a drink.

37:27.242 --> 37:29.076
Pour your own damn drink.

37:29.077 --> 37:31.279
And while you're at it, pour me one.

37:31.280 --> 37:33.181
I've gotta take a leak.

37:33.182 --> 37:35.006
My ship's sailed, motherfucker.

37:35.518 --> 37:38.190
Damn, redneck.

38:01.344 --> 38:04.312
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

38:04.313 --> 38:06.080
<i>Hey.</i>

38:06.081 --> 38:07.549
How's Janey?

38:07.550 --> 38:09.317
<i>Um, she's not so good.</i>

38:09.318 --> 38:12.154
<i>She's, um, she's not
doing so well at school.</i>

38:12.155 --> 38:16.025
<i>She's having trouble sleeping, you know.</i>

38:17.025 --> 38:18.493
Go get her for me.

38:18.494 --> 38:20.062
<i>I'm not gonna get her, it's 10:30 at night.</i>

38:20.063 --> 38:21.129
Let me talk to her, go get her for me.

38:21.130 --> 38:22.730
<i>I'm not gonna get her.</i>

38:22.731 --> 38:24.933
<i>I'm not waking her up at 10:30
at night so she can talk to you.</i>

38:24.934 --> 38:27.229
<i>She's gonna have fucking nightmares, OK?</i>

38:28.637 --> 38:30.305
Beth...

38:30.306 --> 38:33.375
can you go put the phone next to Janey,
for me please?

38:33.376 --> 38:38.279
I'm not going to wake her,
I'm not going to say anything back, OK?

38:38.280 --> 38:41.021
I just want to hear her breathe.

38:50.626 --> 38:53.629
<i>Mom?</i>

38:53.630 --> 38:57.367
<i>It was hard to imagine
Frater outside of war.</i>

38:58.367 --> 39:01.203
<i>This was his eighth tour.</i>

39:01.204 --> 39:05.306
<i>Didn't seem like he was even
afraid of death anymore.</i>

39:05.307 --> 39:08.347
<i>Guess that's how you survive out here.</i>

39:11.347 --> 39:14.683
<i>We'd been on the ground
for 12 weeks and ten days.</i>

39:14.684 --> 39:17.551
<i>Gone on 42 patrols,</i>

39:17.552 --> 39:19.620
<i>killed one monster</i>

39:19.621 --> 39:23.163
<i>and watched a lot of others burn.</i>

39:27.163 --> 39:28.601
<i>Now we got the mission.</i>

39:32.601 --> 39:36.370
Listen up. Five hours ago, we lost comms

39:36.371 --> 39:40.676
with a unit in Altair Desert,
which as you know, is deep IZ.

39:40.677 --> 39:45.180
There's a dense population of MTRs,
air strikes

39:45.181 --> 39:47.351
and hostile insurgent activity.

39:48.351 --> 39:51.185
It is our job to go in,

39:51.186 --> 39:53.421
find them and get them out.

39:53.422 --> 39:57.491
Now their last known location
was Altair Village.

39:57.492 --> 40:01.029
And this here,
is the unit's evacuation cooridor.

40:01.030 --> 40:03.631
This here, is one big hot zone.

40:03.632 --> 40:07.069
So we'll fort deploy
by chopper 12 klicks out.

40:07.070 --> 40:11.006
Take two Humvees,
we got the rest of the way by road.

40:11.007 --> 40:12.674
Now they're just like us,
it could be any one of you

40:12.675 --> 40:14.375
out there in this position.

40:14.376 --> 40:17.078
I pulled down photo IDs
of the men we're looking for.

40:17.079 --> 40:20.482
I want you to burn these four mens'
faces into your heads.

40:20.483 --> 40:23.088
Because we're not coming
home with out them.

40:25.088 --> 40:28.089
That is my job to get you back safe.

40:28.090 --> 40:33.495
If anything should happen, I'll do my best
to get you out of there by road, or by air.

40:33.496 --> 40:34.731
Is that clear?

40:45.507 --> 40:46.713
Cowboys...

40:50.713 --> 40:52.279
Beautiful!

40:52.280 --> 40:55.190
Want one of you guys
while you still have legs.

42:21.103 --> 42:23.706
Shit, MTR!

42:24.706 --> 42:27.423
Right side, right side!

42:41.423 --> 42:43.892
Seanie, MTR!

42:43.893 --> 42:45.760
Coming up back!

42:50.900 --> 42:53.637
Look at that thing. Would you look at that?

42:55.637 --> 42:58.443
Oh, shit!

43:00.443 --> 43:02.209
Did you fucking see that?!

43:02.210 --> 43:03.544
Oh, my God!

43:03.545 --> 43:06.348
Yeah, Mikey!

43:06.349 --> 43:08.149
Whoo!

43:08.150 --> 43:11.852
Roadkill, baby! Who is it?
Whose house is it?

43:11.853 --> 43:15.689
Oh, my God. That little
thing's fucked. Yeah!

43:15.690 --> 43:19.775
One down, ten fuckin' million to go, man!

44:13.282 --> 44:15.755
Williams...!

44:19.613 --> 44:21.555
Chirst, where the fuck did he go?!

44:21.556 --> 44:24.459

44:53.356 --> 44:54.637
Go, go, go, go, go!

45:08.637 --> 45:10.805
Stay with me, man. Stay with me.

45:10.806 --> 45:12.809
You look good. You look real good.

45:14.809 --> 45:18.494
RPG! RPG!

45:32.494 --> 45:34.666
Maguire, get that gun in the fight!

45:37.666 --> 45:38.799
Fuck!

45:38.800 --> 45:40.737
Loading!

45:42.337 --> 45:44.705
Stay with me, baby. Stay with me.
We're good.

45:44.706 --> 45:47.865
- Fucking piece of shit.
- Real good. Real good.

46:10.865 --> 46:12.366
Forrest!

46:12.367 --> 46:13.767
We're going to get you
out of here, Williams.

46:13.768 --> 46:16.705
You're all right. Breathe. Breathe.

46:16.706 --> 46:18.815
Seanie, you're good. You're good.

46:25.815 --> 46:29.418
Forrest! You with me? Forrest!

46:30.418 --> 46:32.654
Forrest... are you with me?

46:32.655 --> 46:34.992
You with me? Forrest.

46:36.992 --> 46:38.228
Forrest, you with me?

46:38.527 --> 46:39.864
Forrest!

46:51.507 --> 46:55.410
How you doing, Seanie?

46:55.411 --> 46:57.516
Breathe!

47:00.516 --> 47:02.157
It's all right.

47:09.157 --> 47:10.746
I gotta go and see my baby.

47:13.728 --> 47:17.399
Look at me! Parkes, look at me!

47:17.400 --> 47:21.535
If I break contact, compound 200 meters.

47:21.536 --> 47:23.541
Mike, get him up!

47:25.541 --> 47:26.836
Come on, man, help me.

47:28.543 --> 47:30.045
One, two...

47:36.585 --> 47:38.118
Watch my six!

47:38.119 --> 47:40.628
Move in! Move!

47:46.628 --> 47:51.170
Are you fucking with me?
Are you collecting your fucking...?

47:54.170 --> 47:57.757
Check those buildings. Check the buildings!

48:15.757 --> 48:17.097
RPG!

48:21.742 --> 48:24.566
All right,
morphine's gonna kick in now, brother.

48:24.567 --> 48:26.201
You'll be feeling no pain.

48:26.202 --> 48:27.535
No pain.

48:27.536 --> 48:28.903
Mikey, we clear?

48:28.904 --> 48:31.434
I don't have the fucking
gear for this, man!

48:34.110 --> 48:38.145
Lucky bastard, you'll be home tomorrow
getting sucked off like a war vet

48:38.146 --> 48:43.498
by my fuckin' sister, yeah.

48:56.498 --> 48:58.106
Cease fire!

49:06.041 --> 49:08.042
Cease fire! Cease fire!

49:08.043 --> 49:11.779
What the fuck are you doing?
Can you even see what you're firing at?

49:11.780 --> 49:14.616
Can you see the enemy?

49:14.617 --> 49:16.718
- No, sergeant.
- Well, you watch me.

49:16.719 --> 49:18.425
Watch the impact of my round.

49:25.226 --> 49:27.160
- Did you see that?!
- Mm-hmm.

49:27.161 --> 49:29.163
All right, then lay down effective fire!

49:29.164 --> 49:31.110
Yes, sergeant!

49:42.110 --> 49:45.284
- I'm thirsty, Inks.
- What?

49:48.284 --> 49:49.755
Cool, baby, cool.

49:53.755 --> 49:55.967
On your right!

50:04.967 --> 50:07.569
Keep breathing. Keep breathing, there.

50:07.570 --> 50:09.971
Renegade this is Tiger One.

50:09.972 --> 50:11.974
Request immediate...

50:16.711 --> 50:18.680
Lima-Romeo

50:18.681 --> 50:23.283
8-5-6-2-4-4-1-2, break.

50:23.284 --> 50:27.254
<i>Tiger One, be advised,
we have no access to your position.</i>

50:27.255 --> 50:28.957
<i>Evac with you in 27 minutes.</i>

50:28.958 --> 50:32.593
Fucking negative!
We'll be dead in 27 minutes!

50:32.594 --> 50:34.328
I said immediate evac! Over!

50:34.329 --> 50:37.799
<i>Tiger One,
we're pushing a drone to your position.</i>

50:37.800 --> 50:41.602
- Fuck.
- <i> Five minutes out.</i>

50:41.603 --> 50:44.939
- How is he, Inkelaar?
- Can't get a fuckin' vein, sergeant.

50:44.940 --> 50:48.676
You gotta use laser guns... fucking arms...
I don't know what to do.

50:48.677 --> 50:53.915
You have to keep trying.
All right, you keep fucking trying.

50:53.916 --> 50:56.786
- Maguire, move!
- Seanie, give me a vein!

50:57.786 --> 51:00.293
Seanie!

51:04.293 --> 51:05.993
Cover the back, Maguire.

51:05.994 --> 51:07.729
That's it, Sean...

51:07.730 --> 51:12.299
Renegade...

51:12.300 --> 51:16.004
- I'm gonna fuckin' get it.
- - I'm going down, man.

51:16.005 --> 51:19.073
- I'm going down, Inks.
- No, baby, baby, you're doing real good.

51:19.074 --> 51:22.009
- I'm dying.
- You're doing good. You're doing really good.

51:22.010 --> 51:23.944
You're doing just what you need to do.

51:23.945 --> 51:27.063
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing, you're beautiful.

51:30.683 --> 51:32.919
Maguire, I said cover the fucking rear!

51:32.920 --> 51:35.989
Cover the fucking rear!

51:35.990 --> 51:38.125
Renegade, here's our location...

51:38.126 --> 51:41.185
I repeat,
we need immediate close air support, break.

51:43.097 --> 51:45.175
It's not going.

51:54.175 --> 51:56.382
I'll fucking get one...

52:01.382 --> 52:03.793
No... No, man.

52:15.230 --> 52:17.737
Seanie...

52:21.737 --> 52:25.177
Sergeant, I...

52:28.177 --> 52:31.479
I couldn't get it, sarge.

52:31.480 --> 52:32.750
I couldn't...

52:34.750 --> 52:37.320
I couldn't...

52:46.094 --> 52:48.074
Ah, fuck.

53:00.074 --> 53:02.150
<i>Tiger One.</i>

53:09.150 --> 53:13.988
<i>Drone is on station.
I say again, drone is on station.</i>

53:13.989 --> 53:17.058
<i>Tiger One, move to compound...</i>

53:17.059 --> 53:19.826
All right, break contact.
There's a secure compound.

53:19.827 --> 53:22.796
It's not far.
We gotta cover each other, two-by-two.

53:22.797 --> 53:24.332
Help me lift him.

53:24.333 --> 53:28.069
Parkes. Parkes. We can't take him.

53:28.070 --> 53:30.337
Fucking, no..

53:30.338 --> 53:32.105
We're not fucking leaving him!

53:32.106 --> 53:33.875
If you carry him.
They will fucking mow you down trying.

53:33.876 --> 53:37.178
- I'm gonna fuckin' carry him!
- They will mow you down trying!

53:37.179 --> 53:40.281
Based off his situation,
he will get picked up.

53:40.282 --> 53:42.350
- You're fucking sick, sergeant.
- He will get picked up.

53:42.351 --> 53:44.852
You understand me?

53:44.853 --> 53:47.288
Inkelaar, Maguire, you clear our exit.

53:47.289 --> 53:49.793
Now fucking guard it, go!

53:57.266 --> 53:59.167
<i>One minute out.</i>

53:59.168 --> 54:01.105
Fucking bullshit.

54:03.105 --> 54:06.110
Fuck this bullshit.

54:08.110 --> 54:09.815
<i>Impact...</i>

54:12.815 --> 54:15.149
Left side, clear.

54:15.150 --> 54:18.386
Sergeant, more... to yours.

54:18.387 --> 54:23.835
<i>Impact in five, four, three, two, one.</i>

54:34.137 --> 54:36.904
<i>You're clear for egress. Godspeed.</i>

54:36.905 --> 54:37.905
Move it!

54:38.873 --> 54:41.211
Last man!

56:25.280 --> 56:28.126
Get fluids in you, now. All of you.

56:38.126 --> 56:41.409
Inkelaar. Inkelaar.

57:09.458 --> 57:10.561
Those IEDs.

57:12.561 --> 57:14.738
Were they for the monsters? Or for us?

57:17.699 --> 57:19.005
Both.

57:23.005 --> 57:26.172
Renegade, Tiger One.

57:26.173 --> 57:28.938
Copy.
Renegade, Tiger One, prepare to receive...

57:31.012 --> 57:32.012
Inks!

57:34.782 --> 57:36.250
Frankie!

57:36.251 --> 57:40.488
- Frankie...
- Fuck! Shit, I'm fuckin' hit!

57:40.489 --> 57:44.258
Frankie, stay down. Stay down!

57:44.259 --> 57:46.333
Mike, is Inks hit?

57:54.235 --> 57:57.242
Fuck, man.

58:00.242 --> 58:02.246
Stay down...

58:04.246 --> 58:06.647
Parkes... Parkes.

58:06.648 --> 58:08.214
Parkes.

58:08.215 --> 58:12.218
You follow what I do. You follow what I do.

58:12.219 --> 58:15.324
Follow what I do. Follow what I do.

58:45.853 --> 58:48.204
What the fuck's going on?

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.836
I'm gonna help you...

01:00:57.318 --> 01:00:59.556
Frankie... Frankie.

01:01:02.556 --> 01:01:04.697
No. No.

01:01:09.697 --> 01:01:11.500
Get your fucking hands off me!

01:01:16.605 --> 01:01:17.605
You watch.

01:01:19.507 --> 01:01:21.542
Helpless.

01:01:21.543 --> 01:01:23.396
Like we watch.

01:01:46.768 --> 01:01:48.835
Get your fucking hands off him!

01:01:48.836 --> 01:01:51.606
I will fucking kill you!
Get your hands off him!

01:02:01.483 --> 01:02:05.019
No... no! No!

01:02:11.293 --> 01:02:13.794
Frankie... Frankie.

01:02:13.795 --> 01:02:15.330
Frankie, you gotta stay awake.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.864
OK, you gotta stay awake for me.

01:02:17.865 --> 01:02:20.369
Somebody help him!

01:02:22.369 --> 01:02:23.773
Oh, God, sergeant!

01:02:25.773 --> 01:02:28.975
Shh, Maguire. Maguire, look at me.

01:02:28.976 --> 01:02:30.612
Look at me.

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.956
Look at me, Maguire.

01:02:44.793 --> 01:02:47.030
Keep looking at me, it's OK.

01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:51.804
It's OK, shh.

01:02:55.804 --> 01:02:57.805
OK...

01:02:57.806 --> 01:03:01.908
Frankie, you gotta stay awake for me,
man, OK?

01:03:01.909 --> 01:03:04.487
I'm sorry... I fucked up, Mike.

01:03:12.487 --> 01:03:15.788
No! Frankie!

01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:18.625
Look at me, man. Look at me, don't go.

01:03:18.626 --> 01:03:19.692
Frankie, look at me.

01:03:19.693 --> 01:03:21.972
Don't leave me!

01:03:47.521 --> 01:03:50.124
No, fuck!

01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:52.128
Frankie!

01:04:00.135 --> 01:04:03.467
Fuck. Fuck.

01:06:37.943 --> 01:06:39.826
I'm going to clear the building.

01:06:39.827 --> 01:06:43.863
There's two bikes out back.
You meet me there.

01:06:43.864 --> 01:06:46.978
We do what we need to do right now.

01:12:05.353 --> 01:12:07.256
Parkes!

01:12:09.256 --> 01:12:11.326
Parkes!

01:12:12.326 --> 01:12:13.326
Parkes?

01:12:13.327 --> 01:12:15.905
Fucking...

01:12:24.905 --> 01:12:27.172
Look at me.

01:12:27.173 --> 01:12:30.676
Parkes, you're in shock. You're in shock.

01:12:30.677 --> 01:12:34.186
Now you listen to me,
you do what I tell you.

01:12:40.186 --> 01:12:42.291
Come here.

01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:46.693
Look at me. Look at me.

01:12:46.694 --> 01:12:49.362
Look at me. Where are you?

01:12:49.363 --> 01:12:53.934
We're up,
80-90 klicks east of the extraction point.

01:12:53.935 --> 01:12:57.170
We're going to find these lost
men and bring them home with us.

01:12:57.171 --> 01:12:59.305
Not with us, there's men behind already.

01:12:59.306 --> 01:13:00.944
I'm not leaving four more.

01:13:02.944 --> 01:13:06.011
We might not have enough gas.

01:13:06.012 --> 01:13:09.349
We might have enough... enough ammo.

01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:12.318
All right. We're gonna be OK, Parkes.

01:13:12.319 --> 01:13:15.255
If you listen to me and you do
what I tell you to do.

01:13:15.256 --> 01:13:17.657
We will complete this mission.

01:13:17.658 --> 01:13:20.373
All right, we'll complete this mission.

01:15:31.692 --> 01:15:34.662
You ever been outside of Detroit, Parkes?

01:15:35.662 --> 01:15:37.466
No.

01:15:38.466 --> 01:15:40.703
I never been anywhere like this.

01:15:43.703 --> 01:15:45.237
You have family?

01:15:45.238 --> 01:15:48.381
What does your father do for a living?

01:15:54.381 --> 01:15:55.783
I don't know.

01:15:56.783 --> 01:15:58.417
You don't know?

01:15:58.418 --> 01:16:00.322
No.

01:16:01.322 --> 01:16:04.131
Never met him.

01:16:11.131 --> 01:16:13.661
The thing I keep with
me when I'm on tour...

01:16:16.503 --> 01:16:18.640
is this walk.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.845
I do it every time I get back.

01:16:24.845 --> 01:16:27.546
I don't get picked up
from the barracks, I...

01:16:27.547 --> 01:16:30.417
I take the bus.

01:16:31.417 --> 01:16:34.821
First thing I do,
I walk straight over to this

01:16:34.822 --> 01:16:38.825
piece of shit Korean
liquor store on the corner,

01:16:38.826 --> 01:16:42.398
because they've got the coldest beer.

01:16:44.398 --> 01:16:47.502
And then I walk to my house,
drinking the beer.

01:16:49.502 --> 01:16:51.872
I get to my front door...

01:16:52.872 --> 01:16:55.774
my wife answers.

01:16:55.775 --> 01:16:59.746
My daughter,
she stands right there next to her.

01:16:59.747 --> 01:17:04.250
And the last time I got back,
I got to my door,

01:17:04.251 --> 01:17:07.653
I could see it in my daughters eyes.

01:17:07.654 --> 01:17:10.292
It was just for a moment.

01:17:12.292 --> 01:17:15.430
But she was scared.

01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:20.234
She didn't know who the fuck I was.

01:17:21.234 --> 01:17:24.238
Why don't you just stop?

01:17:25.238 --> 01:17:28.207
Sit on your porch...

01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:31.243
with your kid and drink cold beer...

01:17:31.244 --> 01:17:33.480
for the rest of your life.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.587
I came here to keep her safe.

01:17:40.587 --> 01:17:42.661
You think we're doing that?

01:17:47.661 --> 01:17:49.738
Yes, I do.

01:19:05.738 --> 01:19:07.607
It's a school bus.

01:19:07.608 --> 01:19:09.917
It's a school bus.

01:19:17.917 --> 01:19:21.000
Look for water. Look for water.

01:19:34.534 --> 01:19:35.601
Ah, fuck.

01:20:08.601 --> 01:20:09.601
Fuck.

01:20:36.462 --> 01:20:38.764
He's alive.

01:20:38.765 --> 01:20:40.478
He's alive.

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:27.690
What do we do?

01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:42.229
We leave him here. Or
we help him on his way.

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.817
Help him on his way.

01:22:03.817 --> 01:22:05.550
You think he's in pain?

01:22:05.551 --> 01:22:08.118
Yeah. I think so.

01:22:39.118 --> 01:22:40.662
God...

01:22:48.662 --> 01:22:50.698
Stop.

01:22:51.698 --> 01:22:53.167
Stop.

01:22:54.167 --> 01:22:55.671
Fuckin' stop!

01:22:58.671 --> 01:23:00.940
Fucking mess...

01:23:20.927 --> 01:23:21.927
Stop it.

01:23:23.663 --> 01:23:25.604
Fuckin' stop!

01:23:31.604 --> 01:23:35.110
Where you going?

01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:14.212
Lower your weapons.

01:24:14.213 --> 01:24:16.750
Put your weapons down.

01:24:23.623 --> 01:24:25.333
This boy is dying.

01:24:34.333 --> 01:24:36.496
We just found him.

01:26:37.289 --> 01:26:39.198
Cigarette?

01:27:13.426 --> 01:27:14.533
Hello.

01:27:19.533 --> 01:27:22.136
No.

01:27:57.136 --> 01:27:59.185
It's the monsters.

01:28:45.185 --> 01:28:47.131
Yeah... two days.

01:32:53.533 --> 01:32:55.434
Look what they did to you.

01:32:55.435 --> 01:32:57.870
How did you let them do this to you?

01:32:57.871 --> 01:33:00.710
I never had a fucking chance.

01:33:03.710 --> 01:33:08.681
Bang... Bang...

01:33:09.681 --> 01:33:10.720
Bang...

01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:21.185
I'm not fucking scared of the monster.

01:35:36.462 --> 01:35:37.580
What is that thing?

01:35:39.564 --> 01:35:40.921
Are those spores?

01:36:01.921 --> 01:36:04.555
It is.

01:36:04.556 --> 01:36:07.032
It's releasing spores in the ground.

01:38:25.697 --> 01:38:27.933
What, you think this is a fucking game?

01:38:27.934 --> 01:38:30.971
You took an unacceptable fucking risk,
private.

01:38:32.971 --> 01:38:35.874
There's four soldiers out there.

01:38:35.875 --> 01:38:38.777
I'm going to find them and bring them home.

01:38:38.778 --> 01:38:42.147
The only thing keeping you alive
is this mission, you understand?

01:38:42.148 --> 01:38:46.550
You jeopardize my position,
I swear I'll take the necessary action.

01:38:46.551 --> 01:38:48.019
You understand me?

01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:50.091
You fucking understand?

01:38:52.861 --> 01:38:55.626
Oh, you're holding hands
with some village girl.

01:38:55.627 --> 01:38:57.899
Get your mind opened, is that it, huh?

01:38:59.899 --> 01:39:00.899
Yes, sergeant.

01:39:01.439 --> 01:39:03.734
Come here. I want to show you something.

01:39:03.735 --> 01:39:05.170
- Come here.
- Get the fuck...

01:39:05.171 --> 01:39:07.706
Come here, I wanna fucking show you...

01:39:07.707 --> 01:39:08.884
Get the fuck off me!

01:39:12.645 --> 01:39:14.850
Now look it! Huh?

01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:22.120
You're not a fucking hero.
You don't get to feel.

01:39:22.121 --> 01:39:26.191
You do the mission.
You do not deviate, you do not question.

01:39:26.192 --> 01:39:28.095
You move on.

01:39:29.095 --> 01:39:31.069
Get on your feet.

01:39:38.069 --> 01:39:41.908
There's a settlement that's close to here.
Our men will be there.

01:39:42.908 --> 01:39:44.876
I will complete this mission.

01:39:44.877 --> 01:39:47.676
Now get on your fucking feet, private.

01:40:50.676 --> 01:40:51.951
All right, check him.

01:40:58.951 --> 01:40:59.997
Hey.

01:41:11.997 --> 01:41:14.766
What are you doing out here?

01:41:32.717 --> 01:41:33.896
It's OK.

01:42:17.896 --> 01:42:20.435
You see that?

01:42:23.435 --> 01:42:25.002
It's just a baby.

01:45:50.242 --> 01:45:52.480
Sergeant!

01:46:11.162 --> 01:46:12.532
- Hey!
- Hey, come here.

01:46:13.532 --> 01:46:14.965
Come here, come here.

01:46:14.966 --> 01:46:16.934
Come here, where did you get that? Huh?

01:46:16.935 --> 01:46:19.938
Come here... Where did you get this?

01:46:19.939 --> 01:46:23.241
Where did you get this?

01:46:23.242 --> 01:46:25.618
You show me. You show me. You show me.

01:48:19.725 --> 01:48:23.428
Who killed those men?!

01:48:23.429 --> 01:48:27.297
Who killed those fucking men? I wanna know.
Who killed those men?

01:48:27.298 --> 01:48:29.234
Tell me!

01:48:30.234 --> 01:48:31.269
Come here.

01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:33.273
You fucking get in here.

01:48:34.273 --> 01:48:36.340
Get in here!

01:48:36.341 --> 01:48:38.843
Get back! Why am I fucking here?!

01:48:38.844 --> 01:48:40.444
To connect fucking bodies?

01:48:40.445 --> 01:48:42.387
Why are those men lying out there?

01:48:44.283 --> 01:48:48.387
I wanna know why!
Why are those men lying out there?

01:48:49.387 --> 01:48:50.740
Why am I fucking here?!

01:48:51.523 --> 01:48:53.624
Why am I not in my fucking house!

01:48:53.625 --> 01:48:56.160
I don't know who my fucking
daughter is anymore!

01:48:56.161 --> 01:48:58.095
Fuck you people!

01:48:58.096 --> 01:49:01.802
I'll put bullets in your fucking head!
I don't know who you are!

01:49:06.838 --> 01:49:08.474
Sergeant...

01:49:12.711 --> 01:49:14.344
No!

01:49:14.345 --> 01:49:17.380
Put your weapon down! Put your weapon down!

01:49:17.381 --> 01:49:18.911
Put it the fuck down, now!

01:49:23.521 --> 01:49:25.489
Why am I here?

01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:28.631
Tell me!

01:49:32.631 --> 01:49:33.631
Tell me.

01:49:35.567 --> 01:49:37.472
Tell me!
