01:57.033 --> 02:00.452
<i>God, she's beautiful.</i>
<i>She's got the prettiest eyes.</i>

02:00.620 --> 02:04.039
<i>She looks so sexy in that sweater.</i>

02:04.207 --> 02:07.501
<i>I just want to be alone with her</i>
<i>and hold her and kiss her,</i>

02:07.669 --> 02:11.713
<i>and tell her how much I love her,</i>
<i>and take care of her.</i>

02:11.923 --> 02:14.758
<i>Stop it, you idiot.</i>
<i>She's your wife's sister.</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:18.470
<i>But I can't help it.</i>
<i>I'm consumed by her.</i>

02:18.638 --> 02:21.140
<i>It's been months now.</i>
<i>I dream about her.</i>

02:21.307 --> 02:23.559
<i>I think about her at the office.</i>

02:24.894 --> 02:26.436
<i>Oh, Lee...</i>

02:26.604 --> 02:28.230
<i>...what am I gonna do?</i>

02:28.898 --> 02:33.235
<i>I hear myself mooning over you</i>
<i>and it's disgusting.</i>

02:34.028 --> 02:36.864
<i>Before, when she squeezed</i>
<i>past me in the doorway</i>

02:37.031 --> 02:39.575
<i>and I smelled that perfume</i>
<i>on the back of her neck,</i>

02:39.742 --> 02:43.287
<i>Jesus, I thought</i>
<i>I was gonna swoon.</i>

02:43.454 --> 02:47.082
<i>Easy. You're a dignified</i>
<i>financial adviser.</i>

02:47.250 --> 02:49.668
<i>It doesn't look good</i>
<i>for you to swoon.</i>

02:50.545 --> 02:54.923
Elliot, have you tried these?
These are wonderful.

02:55.091 --> 02:57.259
Holly and her friend made them.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.721
Fantastic. Your sister
is an unbelievable cook.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.599
I know. She has
all the cooking charm.

03:03.766 --> 03:06.643
- No, you've got talent.
- I've eaten five.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.146
Holly, why don't you open
your own restaurant?

03:09.314 --> 03:10.606
We practically are.

03:10.773 --> 03:15.777
Not a restaurant, but April
and I are gonna do some catering.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.322
- You're kidding!
- No, we decided.

03:18.489 --> 03:19.948
Perfect.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.117
We like to cook for our friends.

03:22.285 --> 03:25.954
Until an acting job comes
we could do parties.

03:26.122 --> 03:29.458
- Great. That's where your talent lies.
- I know.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.628
Can I speak to you privately?

03:32.795 --> 03:35.172
I'm her husband.
She tells me anything.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.508
I have to borrow more money.
Don't get upset.

03:38.676 --> 03:42.679
- I never get upset.
- This is the last time, I promise.

03:42.847 --> 03:45.641
- Don't insult me.
- I'll pay it all back.

03:45.808 --> 03:49.478
- I know. How much do you need?
- Two thousand dollars.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.774
April and I have this catering idea.
It'll be great.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.651
You admit we're great cooks.

03:55.818 --> 03:59.905
There's things I have to buy
and some old debts.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.824
Are we talking
about cocaine again?

04:02.992 --> 04:06.870
I swear. We've already got
requests to do a few parties.

04:07.038 --> 04:10.040
Obviously, I'm not gonna
be a caterer forever.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.669
We still audition.
Something could come up.

04:13.836 --> 04:18.839
My days are free for my acting class.
I haven't done drugs in a year.

04:19.007 --> 04:23.303
<i>♪ A whimpering, simpering</i>
<i>child again</i>

04:23.471 --> 04:28.392
<i>♪ Bewitched, bothered</i>
<i>and bewildered...</i>

04:28.559 --> 04:32.145
Mom and Dad are floating down
memory lane again.

04:32.313 --> 04:35.899
Have you tried the shrimp?
You've outdone yourself.

04:36.067 --> 04:40.696
I need an antihistamine for Mom's
asthma. She's turning into "Camille."

04:40.863 --> 04:43.907
- She's always Camille.
- At least she isn't drinking.

04:44.075 --> 04:48.578
- Doesn't she look great?
- She knows it too. She's flirting.

04:48.746 --> 04:53.333
Maybe when she's 80, she'll stop
straightening her garter belt.

04:53.501 --> 04:57.546
- Where's the antihistamine?
- Ask Elliot. He's got them.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.550
- Frederick didn't come with her.
- Does he ever?

05:01.718 --> 05:05.178
He's such an angry...
such a depressive.

05:05.346 --> 05:08.640
I thought she was moving out.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.226
<i>♪ A pill he is</i>

05:11.394 --> 05:14.563
<i>♪ But still he is</i>

05:14.731 --> 05:17.065
<i>♪ All mine and I'll keep him</i>

05:17.233 --> 05:21.778
<i>♪ Until he is bewitched...</i>

05:21.946 --> 05:26.158
- Watch out, you guys.
- The kids are so adorable.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.243
It gets so lonely on holidays.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.747
Oh, gosh. That's why
I invited Phil Gamisch.

05:31.914 --> 05:35.042
- Hannah, he's such a loser!
- He's not a loser.

05:35.209 --> 05:38.754
- He's a headmaster.
- He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.548
His Adam's apple jumps
when he's excited.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.967
He's better than your ex-husband.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.970
- He's not a dope addict.
- Give me a break.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.765
Am I interrupting any sister talk?

05:49.932 --> 05:53.226
There are no interesting
single men here.

05:53.394 --> 05:54.853
It's terrible!

05:55.021 --> 05:58.440
Maybe April would like Phil.
Phil, tall guy.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.735
I met Phil. He looks
like Ichabod Crane?

06:01.903 --> 06:06.323
- I love that. That's my type.
- I don't believe it.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.367
We mustn't get discouraged.

06:08.534 --> 06:12.913
Hannah will invite some men over
who don't look like Ichabod.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.665
Maybe at Christmas or New Year's.

06:15.833 --> 06:19.252
If not this New Year's,
maybe next New Year's. Ouch!

06:19.420 --> 06:21.171
Must be here someplace.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.216
I love that book,
<i>The Easter Parade.</i>

06:24.384 --> 06:27.135
You were right.
It had meaning for me.

06:27.303 --> 06:31.098
- How's Frederick? He didn't come.
- One of his moods.

06:31.265 --> 06:34.643
Although it wasn't a bad week.
He sold a picture.

06:34.811 --> 06:38.146
One of his better drawings,
a beautiful nude study.

06:38.314 --> 06:41.608
It was of me.
It's a funny feeling to know

06:41.776 --> 06:44.486
you're hung naked
in a stranger's home.

06:44.654 --> 06:48.448
But you can't tell it's me...
You're turning all red.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.659
Really?

06:50.827 --> 06:55.497
- What else? What are you up to?
- My unemployment's running out.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.625
I thought of taking
some courses at Columbia.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.961
- Like...?
- I don't know exactly.

07:01.129 --> 07:05.549
Sociology, psychology.
I might like to work with children.

07:05.716 --> 07:08.927
I always have clients
who are furnishing places.

07:09.095 --> 07:13.348
Some might be interested
in buying art. Shall I call you?

07:13.516 --> 07:16.768
Frederick would be
grateful for a sale.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.478
Guys? Dinner's ready.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.981
You look so beautiful.
Doesn't she look pretty?

07:21.149 --> 07:24.943
I bumped into your ex-husband.
He's crazy as ever.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.820
He was getting a blood test.

07:26.988 --> 07:30.866
Mickey's such a hypochondriac.
Could he handle real illness?

07:31.033 --> 07:32.492
Let's go have dinner.

07:34.370 --> 07:37.914
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Dad.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.667
- Dad!
- No, now...

07:40.877 --> 07:43.879
- We're starving.
- This is a toast.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.714
This is a toast.

07:45.882 --> 07:49.050
You know, this beautiful
Thanksgiving dinner

07:49.218 --> 07:52.512
was all prepared by Hannah.

07:52.680 --> 07:56.057
A little help from Mary,
also Holly and April.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.768
No, you did it.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.982
And we drink to her,
and we all congratulate her

08:04.192 --> 08:08.028
on her wonderful accomplishment
during this last year,

08:08.196 --> 08:11.198
her great success
<i>in A Doll's House.</i>

08:11.365 --> 08:14.910
- Hooray!
- Bravo!

08:15.077 --> 08:19.873
I played Nora, I hate to tell you
what year, and it's difficult

08:20.041 --> 08:22.584
to behave like Torvald's
"little chipmunk"

08:22.752 --> 08:26.171
without making a perfect ass
out of yourself.

08:26.631 --> 08:30.800
I think that Ibsen would've
been damn proud of our Hannah.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.719
Speech!

08:32.886 --> 08:35.514
No, I've been very, very lucky.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.390
When I had the kids,
I stopped working

08:38.558 --> 08:42.229
and devoted myself to the family.

08:42.395 --> 08:45.899
But I've always hoped
that some little gem

08:46.067 --> 08:49.236
would tempt me back on the stage.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.071
I got that out of my system

08:51.239 --> 08:54.616
and I can go back
to what makes me happiest.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.451
Bravo!

09:09.382 --> 09:13.426
<i>Is it my imagination,</i>
<i>or does Elliot have a crush on me?</i>

09:13.594 --> 09:16.846
<i>It's funny.</i>
<i>I've had that thought before.</i>

09:17.014 --> 09:19.474
<i>He pays a lot of attention to me.</i>

09:19.642 --> 09:22.978
<i>And he blushed tonight</i>
<i>when we were alone.</i>

09:23.145 --> 09:25.397
<i>I wonder if he and Hannah are happy.</i>

09:26.065 --> 09:30.986
<i>It's funny. I still feel</i>
<i>a little buzz from his flirting.</i>

09:36.409 --> 09:38.159
Want some coffee or tea?

09:38.327 --> 09:39.411
No, thank you.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.664
- How about something to eat?
- No, nothing.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.458
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.044
What am I gonna do
with you? God...

09:49.297 --> 09:54.426
And why didn't you come?
We all had a terrific time.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.972
I'm going through a period
where I can't be around people.

09:59.140 --> 10:03.685
- I didn't want to abuse anyone.
- You wouldn't. They're so sweet.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.896
You are the only person
I can be with,

10:07.064 --> 10:09.524
who I look forward to being with.

10:09.692 --> 10:13.028
You're too harsh with everyone,
you know that.

10:14.947 --> 10:18.283
- Isn't it enough that I can love you?
- You're such a puzzle.

10:18.451 --> 10:23.204
So sweet with me
and so contemptuous of everyone else.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.708
There was a time when you
were happy to be only with me.

10:26.876 --> 10:30.545
You wanted to learn
about poetry, about music.

10:30.713 --> 10:35.008
Have I taught you everything
I can give? I don't think so.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.724
Elliot might have
a couple of clients for you.

10:42.892 --> 10:46.561
I'm sure those morons
have deep feelings for art.

10:46.729 --> 10:50.565
You never know.
He's just trying to do the nice thing.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.734
- Because he likes you.
- Me?

10:52.902 --> 10:55.403
Yeah, Elliot lusts after you.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.405
Based on what?
You never see him.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.658
Based on whenever you see him

10:59.825 --> 11:04.245
you come home
with books he's recommended.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.831
No, he's my sister's husband.

11:06.999 --> 11:10.752
If you gave him half a chance,
you'd like him.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.922
He's a glorified accountant,
and he's after you.

11:15.257 --> 11:19.761
And I prefer to sell my work
to people who appreciate it.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.098
You understand?

11:31.357 --> 11:35.360
- They won't let us do the sketch?
- It's too dirty.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.780
But we showed it to them
in rehearsal.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.865
Mickey, half-hour to air.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.786
- The show's five minutes short.
- How can it be short?

11:44.954 --> 11:48.957
- Now we'll be ten minutes short.
- They can't do that.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.627
- Our ratings are low.
- I have such a migraine.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.296
We better go
to Ronnie's dressing room.

11:55.464 --> 11:58.800
He must've taken quaaludes.
He can't do the show.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.887
Why me, Lord? What did I...?
Standards and Practices?

12:03.055 --> 12:07.142
- Why is the sketch dirty?
- Child molestation is touchy.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.060
Half the country's doing it.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.355
- But you name names.
- No, we say "the pope."

12:12.523 --> 12:15.150
That sketch cannot go
on the air.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.111
Who changed my sketch
about the PLO?

12:18.279 --> 12:22.198
- I had to cut four lines.
- The premise is ruined.

12:22.366 --> 12:25.034
You're crazy. It's not so delicate.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.913
I don't want anyone tampering
without telling me.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.416
You want them cut,
I'll cut them myself.

12:31.584 --> 12:36.171
Listen, instead of the molestation
sketch, why don't we repeat

12:36.338 --> 12:39.048
the Cardinal Spellman/Ronald Reagan
homosexual dance number?

12:39.216 --> 12:40.592
I don't feel good.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.386
What did you do,
swallow a drugstore?

12:43.554 --> 12:44.846
I lost my voice.

12:45.014 --> 12:49.058
Ronnie, you have to go on
in 25 minutes.

12:49.226 --> 12:52.187
Does anybody got a Tagamet?
My ulcer.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.314
You want a quaalude?

12:55.274 --> 12:57.692
<i>This show's ruining my health.</i>

12:57.860 --> 13:00.195
<i>My ex-partner moves to California.</i>

13:00.362 --> 13:04.365
<i>Every stupid show he produces</i>
<i>turns into a big hit.</i>

13:04.533 --> 13:07.202
<i>What am I gonna do with my life?</i>

13:07.870 --> 13:11.456
<i>I gotta remember to see</i>
<i>my ex-wife tomorrow.</i>

13:15.377 --> 13:18.588
Hi! Glad you could
put in an appearance.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.548
I got two minutes.

13:20.716 --> 13:24.552
The show's killing me.
I got a million appointments.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.223
- I gotta see...
- Two minutes on your sons' birthday.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.558
Happy birthday, fellas.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.353
Guys, look.
Daddy brought presents.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.480
A little hug? What is this?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.233
How about some action?
How is everything?

13:38.400 --> 13:40.068
Everything's good.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.530
Open the presents.
Let me get some reaction.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.281
- How's Elliot?
- He's fine.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.743
I'm trying to convince him
to produce a play.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.328
That'll be terrific.

13:50.496 --> 13:54.082
I like him, he's a sweet guy.
Isn't that a great mitt?

13:54.250 --> 13:58.002
Because he's a loser.
He's awkward and clumsy like me.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.005
I always like
an under-confident person.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.423
He wanted a mitt.

14:02.591 --> 14:07.512
- You've had good taste in husbands.
- Thanks. That's a beauty.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.430
Go over there. Come on, hurry.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.642
Go out by the Sung vase
and catch this.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.060
Watch the picture!

14:14.228 --> 14:19.607
<i>Hannah's sweet.</i>
<i>Although sometimes I still do get angry.</i>

14:19.775 --> 14:22.235
<i>At least I'm not paying</i>
<i>child support.</i>

14:23.362 --> 14:26.281
<i>I hope there's nothing</i>
<i>physically wrong with me.</i>

14:26.448 --> 14:28.449
What's the problem this time?

14:28.617 --> 14:32.036
This time I really think
I have something.

14:32.204 --> 14:37.000
It's not like that adenoidal thing,
where I'd had them out.

14:37.167 --> 14:41.337
I saw your father.
He complained of chest pains.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.799
This guy's the real
hypochondriac of the family.

14:44.967 --> 14:49.512
- You mentioned you'd had dizziness.
- Yes, and I'm developing

14:49.680 --> 14:52.223
a hearing loss in my right ear.
Left ear.

14:52.391 --> 14:55.935
Sorry, my right...
Right or left. I can't remember.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.270
Let's take a look.

15:18.208 --> 15:23.046
You have had a significant drop
in the high decibel range.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.505
Really?

15:24.673 --> 15:27.926
You been exposed
to a loud noise or a virus?

15:28.093 --> 15:32.513
I've been perfectly healthy.
I always imagine I have things.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.891
When did you first notice this?

15:35.059 --> 15:37.602
About a month ago.
What do I have?

15:37.770 --> 15:42.148
You've had dizzy spells.
What about ringing and buzzing?

15:42.316 --> 15:47.320
Yes, now that you mention it,
I have buzzing and also ringing.

15:47.488 --> 15:51.699
- Ringing and buzzing. Am I going deaf?
- It's just one ear.

15:51.867 --> 15:55.453
Is it healthier
to have problems in both ears?

15:56.830 --> 16:01.125
Make an appointment
at the hospital to run some tests.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.378
The hospital? What kind of tests?

16:03.545 --> 16:05.797
Don't get alarmed.

16:05.965 --> 16:10.218
These are just more
sophisticated tests. It's nothing.

16:10.386 --> 16:14.055
Then why go to the hospital?
I hear fine.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.308
So I'm weak in the high decibels.

16:17.476 --> 16:21.062
Don't panic. I just wanna
rule out some things.

16:21.230 --> 16:25.066
- Like what?
- It's nothing. Will you trust me?

16:25.234 --> 16:28.236
Hello, Dr. Wilkes?
This is Mickey Sachs.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.530
I wanna ask you a question.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.407
Sure. What's up?

16:32.574 --> 16:35.159
If you have a hearing loss
in one ear

16:35.327 --> 16:38.621
and it's not from a virus
or a loud noise,

16:38.789 --> 16:41.040
what are the possibilities?

16:41.208 --> 16:44.043
Anything. Often it's hereditary.

16:44.211 --> 16:47.046
Flu, even a small noise will do it.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.923
Right, but nothing worse?

16:49.091 --> 16:53.928
I guess the dark side
of the spectrum is a brain tumor.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.640
Really?

16:57.808 --> 17:01.060
- Here's the new pages.
- Did Cards get these?

17:01.228 --> 17:03.521
- Not yet.
- Let's hope it's good.

17:03.689 --> 17:07.900
Yeah, really.
We'll be down in a minute, OK?

17:08.068 --> 17:10.819
Mickey, what's the matter with you?

17:10.988 --> 17:13.948
I feel dizzy. I don't feel well.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.784
Do you hear a ringing?
Is there a ringing?

17:16.952 --> 17:20.204
- Yeah, I hear it. Hello?
- Not that.

17:20.372 --> 17:24.959
Yeah, we're gonna be working late.
No, we'll order out.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.128
If I have a tumor,
I don't know what I'll do.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.673
He didn't say you had a tumor.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.341
They don't tell you.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.136
Sometimes the weaker ones
will panic.

17:35.304 --> 17:39.390
- But not you.
- Oh, God. You hear a buzzing?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.893
Come on, we got a show to do.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.313
- I can't focus.
- But there's nothing wrong.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.775
Then why does he want more tests?

17:48.942 --> 17:50.610
He has to rule out things.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.613
- Like what?
- I don't know. Cancer.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.325
Don't say that.
I don't wanna hear that word.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.327
But you don't have symptoms.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.371
I got the classic symptoms
of a brain tumor.

18:02.539 --> 18:05.500
Two months ago
it was a malignant melanoma.

18:05.667 --> 18:09.337
The sudden appearance
of a black spot on my back.

18:09.505 --> 18:13.841
- It was on your shirt.
- How was I to know?

18:14.009 --> 18:16.219
We've got to make decisions.

18:16.386 --> 18:19.806
I can't think.
This morning I was so happy.

18:19.973 --> 18:23.935
- I don't know what went wrong.
- You were miserable.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.814
We got bad reviews.
The sponsors are furious.

18:27.981 --> 18:31.234
I was happy,
but I just didn't realize I was.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.740
These are delicious!
What are they?

18:37.908 --> 18:40.993
Those are quail eggs.
Aren't they good?

18:41.161 --> 18:44.664
My friend April makes those.
Try a shrimp puff.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.542
- That looks good.
- I make those.

18:48.335 --> 18:51.754
Excuse me. Thank you.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.716
- The stroganoff is ready.
- We're a hit!

18:55.884 --> 18:58.052
In this. Yesterday, I auditioned.

18:58.220 --> 19:02.265
- That wasn't a hit.
- You'll get five jobs next week.

19:02.432 --> 19:06.060
- Are there any more clams?
- A few. You like them?

19:06.228 --> 19:08.646
- I can't resist.
- How flattering.

19:08.814 --> 19:13.401
- Did you try the shrimp?
- You're too attractive to be caterers.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.903
- We're actresses.
- Your first job?

19:16.071 --> 19:18.447
- Is the food that bad?
- Not at all.

19:18.615 --> 19:22.201
We need more sauce
for the lasagna. Hi.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.996
You're an actress
with a flair for shrimp.

19:25.164 --> 19:29.250
The shrimp puffs are Holly's.
I do the crepes caviar.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.253
And the quail's responsible
for the eggs.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.256
I stole you a couple of extra clams.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.759
- Incidentally, I'm David Tolchin.
- April Knox, hi.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.219
You're Holly.

19:40.387 --> 19:43.055
We're the Stanislavski
Catering Company.

19:43.223 --> 19:47.602
I'll tell you the truth.
I was bored stiff by the party.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.729
We're more interesting?

19:49.897 --> 19:53.024
I'll listen to <i>Aida</i>,
if I'm not in your way.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.400
Not at all.

19:54.568 --> 19:58.988
We saw Pavarotti in <i>Ernani</i>
at the Met, and I cried.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.281
I cry at the opera.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.618
I go limp in the last scene
in <i>La Traviata</i>.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.579
Me too.
I have a private box at the Met.

20:06.747 --> 20:10.917
I bring my bottle of wine,
I watch and I cry. Disgusting.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.502
- What do you do?
- I'm an architect.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.463
What do you build?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.965
- Are you really interested?
- Yeah.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.426
What time do you get off?

20:22.304 --> 20:25.556
- It's the red one?
- It's magnificent.

20:25.724 --> 20:30.561
The design's noncontextual, but
I wanted to keep the street atmosphere

20:30.729 --> 20:33.731
on the proportions
and the material.

20:33.899 --> 20:37.151
- That's unpolished red granite.
- Is it?

20:37.319 --> 20:40.738
- It has an organic quality.
- Right.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.450
Entirely interdependent,
if you know what I mean.

20:44.618 --> 20:49.288
I can't put it into words.
The important thing is, it breathes.

20:49.456 --> 20:53.000
April, people pass by vital
structures all the time.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.294
They never appreciate them.

20:55.462 --> 20:57.838
You tune into your environment.

20:58.006 --> 21:01.509
- It's important.
- What are your favorite buildings?

21:01.677 --> 21:02.885
You wanna see some?

21:03.053 --> 21:05.388
Well, let's do it.

21:49.057 --> 21:53.894
It's just so romantic.
I wanna open the French doors...

21:54.062 --> 21:57.148
- It's French.
- It is. It's romantic.

21:57.316 --> 22:01.777
And it's got a handsome partner
sitting right beside it.

22:01.945 --> 22:05.948
Your eye goes along,
lulled into complacency, and then...

22:06.116 --> 22:08.534
- That's just...
- Look at this.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.786
That's really terrible.

22:10.954 --> 22:13.622
- And it ruins everything else.
- It does.

22:13.790 --> 22:16.375
We've seen a lot
of stuff today.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.794
We should think about going home.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.504
- Yeah.
- OK.

22:20.672 --> 22:24.759
- Who gets dropped first?
- Gee, I don't know.

22:24.926 --> 22:29.055
- I live downtown.
- We both live downtown.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.767
It depends on what way you wanna go.

22:32.934 --> 22:37.730
I know. If we took Fifth,
then we'd get to your house first.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.483
- We could do that.
- But Fifth is jammed.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.652
- I mean...
- Well, sometimes.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.072
You live in Chelsea, don't you?

22:46.239 --> 22:49.617
If you live in Chelsea,
that's probably first.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.827
- OK.
- And then April.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.079
Great.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.463
<i>Naturally, I get taken home first.</i>

23:02.631 --> 23:04.715
<i>Obviously, he prefers April.</i>

23:04.883 --> 23:07.635
<i>Of course, I was so tongue-tied</i>
<i>all night.</i>

23:07.803 --> 23:10.388
<i>I can't believe I said that</i>
<i>about the Guggenheim.</i>

23:10.555 --> 23:14.683
<i>My stupid roller-skating joke.</i>
<i>I should never tell jokes.</i>

23:14.851 --> 23:17.812
<i>Mom can tell them, and Hannah,</i>
<i>but I kill them.</i>

23:18.355 --> 23:23.776
<i>Where did April come up</i>
<i>with terms like "organic form"?</i>

23:23.944 --> 23:27.154
<i>Well, naturally. She went to Brandeis.</i>

23:27.322 --> 23:30.491
<i>She doesn't know</i>
<i>what she's talking about.</i>

23:30.659 --> 23:34.161
<i>Could you believe the way</i>
<i>she was calling him David?</i>

23:34.329 --> 23:38.040
<i>"I feel that way too, David.</i>
<i>Marvelous space, David."</i>

23:38.208 --> 23:40.793
<i>I hate April. She's pushy.</i>

23:41.294 --> 23:45.339
<i>They'll dump me, and she'll</i>
<i>invite him up. I blew it.</i>

23:46.383 --> 23:48.676
<i>And I really like him a lot.</i>

23:49.386 --> 23:51.554
<i>Screw it. I'm not gonna get upset.</i>

23:51.721 --> 23:55.558
<i>I've got reading to do.</i>
<i>I'll get into bed early</i>

23:55.725 --> 23:57.601
<i>and take an extra Seconal.</i>

25:21.436 --> 25:24.939
- My goodness.
- Elliot! What are you doing here?

25:25.106 --> 25:28.609
- I'm looking for a bookstore.
- In this section?

25:28.777 --> 25:31.946
I'm killing time.
I have a client near here.

25:32.113 --> 25:35.449
- How about you?
- Well, I live...

25:35.617 --> 25:37.451
- You live near here.
- I do.

25:37.619 --> 25:40.913
- Where are you headed?
- To my AA meeting.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.958
Why do you still go?
You never touch alcohol.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.709
You didn't know me
before Frederick.

25:45.877 --> 25:49.630
I'd start with a beer
at ten in the morning.

25:49.798 --> 25:53.801
- You must've been very unhappy.
- Unhappy and fat.

25:53.969 --> 25:56.387
I still find
the meetings comforting.

25:56.555 --> 26:00.808
I'll never understand it.
You're so bright and beautiful.

26:00.976 --> 26:04.562
I think to myself,
"What problems could she have?"

26:04.729 --> 26:07.606
Don't let me get started
on my childhood.

26:07.774 --> 26:11.485
You know what?
There is a bookstore near here.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.404
You'd really love it.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.155
- Yes?
- You would.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.366
- If you have some free time...
- Sure.

26:17.534 --> 26:18.826
Thank you.

26:20.620 --> 26:23.163
Isn't this great? They have everything.

26:23.331 --> 26:25.833
- Wonderful.
- What book did you want?

26:26.001 --> 26:27.918
- What?
- You wanted a book?

26:28.086 --> 26:32.006
No, I'm killing time.
I just want to browse.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.591
You picked the right place.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.677
You can stay all afternoon
and just read.

26:36.845 --> 26:40.264
Unless you have time.
We could get some coffee.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.392
- I don't have time.
- I understand.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.353
No problem. You're busy. I...

26:46.521 --> 26:49.690
You seem tense.
Everything all right? No?

26:49.858 --> 26:52.192
- Yes.
- Everything's OK?

26:52.360 --> 26:54.403
Yeah. How are you?

26:54.571 --> 26:56.363
I'm all right.

26:56.531 --> 26:58.657
- How's Frederick?
- Fine.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.410
We went
to the Caravaggio exhibition.

27:01.578 --> 27:06.373
It's such a treat to go with Frederick.
You learn so much.

27:06.541 --> 27:10.044
- Do you like Caravaggio?
- Yes, who doesn't?

27:10.545 --> 27:12.296
Look.

27:13.590 --> 27:16.884
e.e. cummings.
I'd like to get you this.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.844
I can't let you get me that.

27:19.012 --> 27:22.014
- I'd like to very much.
- I don't think so.

27:22.182 --> 27:25.100
I read a poem of you
and thought of his last week.

27:25.268 --> 27:28.812
A poem of his and thought of you.

27:29.397 --> 27:30.731
You'll be fine.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.192
This is great.
I love e.e. cummings.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.444
I'd love to get you this.

27:35.612 --> 27:39.239
And maybe we could
discuss it sometime.

27:44.579 --> 27:48.207
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks for showing me the bookstore.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.585
You could take me
to an AA meeting sometime.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.380
- I'd love to see it.
- You'd love it.

27:54.547 --> 27:57.758
It's really entertaining.
You'd have a good time.

27:57.926 --> 28:01.261
And don't forget
the poem on page 112.

28:01.429 --> 28:04.098
- It reminded me of you.
- Really?

28:08.478 --> 28:09.978
Page 112.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.147
- Bye.
- Bye!

28:19.698 --> 28:23.492
<i>"Your slightest look</i>
<i>Easily will unclose me</i>

28:23.660 --> 28:26.286
<i>Though I have closed myself</i>
<i>As fingers</i>

28:26.454 --> 28:29.540
<i>You open always</i>
<i>Petal by petal myself</i>

28:29.708 --> 28:33.460
<i>As spring opens</i>
<i>Touching skillfully, mysteriously</i>

28:33.628 --> 28:35.462
<i>Her first rose</i>

28:37.006 --> 28:41.468
<i>I do not know what it is about you</i>
<i>That closes and opens</i>

28:41.636 --> 28:44.179
<i>Only something in me understands</i>

28:44.347 --> 28:49.309
<i>The voice of your eyes</i>
<i>Is deeper than all roses</i>

28:49.477 --> 28:53.021
<i>Nobody, not even the rain</i>

28:53.189 --> 28:55.566
<i>Has such small hands"</i>

29:51.080 --> 29:54.082
I wasn't too happy
with your ENG results,

29:54.250 --> 29:55.876
or your BSER either.

29:56.044 --> 30:01.215
That's why I sent you to tomography,
all that stuff rolling around.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.217
See this gray area here?

30:04.052 --> 30:07.971
That area's what I had
hoped we wouldn't run into.

30:08.139 --> 30:12.059
I'd like you to come in Monday
for a CAT scan.

30:12.227 --> 30:16.730
- A brain scan?
- Let's take one step at a time.

30:16.898 --> 30:21.109
We won't make any decisions
until we have all the information.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.574
<i>OK, take it easy.</i>

30:27.742 --> 30:30.077
<i>He didn't say you had anything.</i>

30:30.870 --> 30:33.997
<i>He just doesn't like</i>
<i>the spot on your X-ray.</i>

30:34.165 --> 30:38.252
<i>Doesn't mean you have anything.</i>
<i>Don't jump to conclusions.</i>

30:38.545 --> 30:40.420
<i>Nothing's gonna happen to you.</i>

30:40.588 --> 30:43.298
<i>You're in New York City.</i>
<i>This is your town.</i>

30:43.466 --> 30:46.593
<i>You're surrounded by traffic</i>
<i>and restaurants.</i>

30:46.761 --> 30:51.098
<i>God! How can you just,</i>
<i>one day, vanish?</i>

30:51.766 --> 30:55.018
<i>Keep calm. You're gonna be OK.</i>

30:55.186 --> 30:57.229
<i>Don't panic.</i>

30:58.147 --> 31:02.943
<i>I'm dying! I know it!</i>
<i>There's a spot on my lungs!</i>

31:03.111 --> 31:07.155
<i>Take it easy. It's not on</i>
<i>your lungs. It's on your ear.</i>

31:07.323 --> 31:11.076
<i>It's the same thing, isn't it?</i>
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

31:11.244 --> 31:14.830
<i>God, there's a tumor in my head</i>
<i>the size of a basketball.</i>

31:14.998 --> 31:18.458
<i>I keep thinking I can feel</i>
<i>it every time I blink.</i>

31:18.626 --> 31:21.962
<i>Jesus! He wants me</i>
<i>to do a brain scan</i>

31:22.130 --> 31:24.673
<i>to confirm what he already suspects.</i>

31:24.841 --> 31:28.135
<i>I'll make a deal with God.</i>
<i>Let it just be my ear.</i>

31:28.303 --> 31:30.762
<i>I'll go deaf and blind in one eye.</i>

31:30.930 --> 31:32.639
<i>I don't want a brain operation.</i>

31:32.807 --> 31:36.351
<i>I'll wind up like the guy</i>
<i>with the wool cap</i>

31:36.519 --> 31:38.896
<i>who delivers for the florist.</i>

31:39.063 --> 31:43.400
<i>Your whole life you run to doctors.</i>
<i>The news is always fine.</i>

31:43.568 --> 31:46.612
<i>That's not true.</i>
<i>What about years ago?</i>

31:46.779 --> 31:50.365
I'm sorry to say
that you cannot have children.

31:52.452 --> 31:56.288
- Gee.
- Is there no chance?

31:56.456 --> 31:59.291
You can have a normal sex life,

31:59.459 --> 32:02.669
but his tests indicate
that he is infertile.

32:02.837 --> 32:05.547
Small sperm volume and infertile.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.841
Anything I can do? Pushups?

32:08.009 --> 32:10.802
- I'm afraid not.
- I need a second opinion.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.555
- This is the second opinion.
- A third.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.849
I realize this is a blow.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.769
In my experience,
many fine marriages

32:18.937 --> 32:21.855
become unstable
and are destroyed

32:22.023 --> 32:24.858
by an inability to deal with this.

32:25.026 --> 32:28.862
I hope you won't make too much of it.
One can adopt,

32:29.030 --> 32:32.783
and there are artificial
methods of fertilization.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.868
I'm so humiliated. I don't...

32:35.036 --> 32:36.787
Did you ruin yourself?

32:36.955 --> 32:41.041
- How could I ruin myself?
- Excessive masturbation?

32:41.209 --> 32:45.837
You gonna knock my hobbies? Jesus.
Maybe we can adopt a child.

32:46.005 --> 32:49.257
- What about artificial insemination?
- What?

32:49.425 --> 32:52.135
- I'd get implanted from...
- A stranger?

32:52.303 --> 32:55.263
They have banks
where they keep them frozen.

32:55.431 --> 32:59.184
- A defrosted kid?
- I want to experience childbirth.

32:59.352 --> 33:03.146
- With a stranger?
- Think about it. That's all I ask.

33:03.314 --> 33:07.025
I think that's the best show
you two ever wrote.

33:07.193 --> 33:11.446
The funniest show we did
was the one we won the Emmy for.

33:11.614 --> 33:14.658
I think as far as laughs,

33:14.826 --> 33:17.160
that was probably
the best thing we ever did.

33:17.328 --> 33:21.707
But the show about the Frenchmen,
that was funny and warm.

33:21.874 --> 33:24.126
We got that idea
on that Paris trip.

33:24.293 --> 33:28.005
Remember that?
Hannah had jet lag for six weeks.

33:28.172 --> 33:31.758
But it was... I guess we had fun
when we were there.

33:31.926 --> 33:34.052
Sorry. Coffee?

33:34.220 --> 33:36.972
Listen, you guys, we...
Want some more?

33:37.140 --> 33:42.019
We had something we really
wanted to discuss with you.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.771
Jesus, this is very delicate

33:44.939 --> 33:47.774
and I only bring this up
amongst friends.

33:47.942 --> 33:50.652
I mean, this is...

33:50.820 --> 33:53.613
This shouldn't go
further than this room.

33:53.781 --> 33:57.284
I'm all ears.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.495
Hannah and I can't have any children.

34:00.663 --> 34:04.791
I don't want to get into whose fault
it is... It's my fault.

34:04.959 --> 34:07.919
And the details are
too embarrassing to...

34:08.087 --> 34:10.964
We decided after
a lot of discussion

34:11.132 --> 34:14.092
that we'd try
artificial insemination.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.887
I'm not so sure
I like that idea myself.

34:17.054 --> 34:20.724
I didn't really want
to go to a sperm bank,

34:20.891 --> 34:24.393
have some anonymous donor.
I wouldn't want that.

34:24.562 --> 34:28.482
If we were gonna do it,
we'd like somebody we knew

34:28.649 --> 34:31.275
and was warm and bright.

34:31.444 --> 34:36.447
You can say no. We realize
it has all kinds of implications.

34:36.616 --> 34:40.159
The point we're making
is that we need some sperm.

34:43.498 --> 34:44.831
Gee.

34:45.666 --> 34:49.418
Well, my first reaction
after the initial shock

34:49.587 --> 34:51.838
is flattered that you'd ask.

34:52.005 --> 34:56.092
I'd be the father.
You'd just masturbate into a cup.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.302
I can handle that.

34:57.470 --> 35:00.347
Obviously, we wouldn't
have intercourse.

35:01.140 --> 35:05.435
Gosh, I've gotta tell you the truth.
I'm uneasy about this.

35:05.603 --> 35:06.978
It's a lot to ask.

35:07.146 --> 35:10.941
I feel for you, I do. I'm gonna cry.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.152
You want my husband
to have a child with you?

35:14.320 --> 35:15.904
Don't answer now.

35:16.072 --> 35:19.699
Just take it home
and think about it for a while.

35:20.451 --> 35:25.163
I gave blood before,
and clothing to the poor.

35:25.331 --> 35:28.083
I wanna talk about this at home.

35:28.251 --> 35:31.795
I think it's a matter
for your analyst and mine.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.588
And maybe my lawyer.

35:33.756 --> 35:36.174
We understand completely

35:36.342 --> 35:39.636
if you feel you'd rather not.

35:39.804 --> 35:44.891
I didn't mean to spoil the evening.
Let's move on.

35:45.059 --> 35:48.854
<i>So you had my ex-partner's baby. Twins.</i>

35:49.021 --> 35:53.567
<i>Maybe that caused trouble,</i>
<i>but we were drifting apart anyhow.</i>

35:53.734 --> 35:56.862
<i>Instead of man and wife</i>
<i>we're good friends.</i>

35:57.029 --> 36:00.532
<i>Boy, love is really unpredictable.</i>

36:53.669 --> 36:56.713
Lee, Frederick,
say hello to Dusty Fry.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.298
- Hi, Dusty.
- Hi.

36:58.466 --> 37:02.385
Dusty has bought a house
in Southampton. He's decorating it.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.095
It's a weird place.

37:04.263 --> 37:07.140
A lot of wall space.
How you doing, man?

37:07.308 --> 37:10.143
I told him about your work.
He's excited.

37:10.311 --> 37:13.313
I got an Andy Warhol
and a Frank Stella.

37:13.481 --> 37:16.650
It's very beautiful.
Big, weird, you know.

37:16.817 --> 37:21.321
If you stare at that Stella,
the colors seem to float.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.657
You decided
to become a collector?

37:23.824 --> 37:28.203
Yeah, I got a lot to learn, though.
I wasn't into art as a kid.

37:28.371 --> 37:32.624
- Do you appreciate drawings?
- Yeah.

37:32.792 --> 37:36.836
Oh, hey. Wow, she's beautiful.

37:37.713 --> 37:42.050
But, really, I need something...
I'm looking for something big.

37:42.218 --> 37:45.178
- Show him the oils.
- They're in the basement.

37:45.346 --> 37:48.431
Frederick's done this
new series you'd love.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.976
- Are they big?
- Some of them, yeah.

37:51.143 --> 37:53.019
I got a lot of wall space.

37:53.187 --> 37:58.525
- I don't sell my work by the yard.
- Oh, Frederick.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.740
How's everything?

38:05.908 --> 38:09.577
Oh, you know.
I talked to Hannah this morning.

38:09.745 --> 38:12.372
You two might be going
to the country.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.624
She loves to go out in the woods.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.251
But I go nuts.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.378
It's a conflict.

38:20.214 --> 38:24.009
- I have to get my teeth cleaned.
- That's nice.

38:26.387 --> 38:30.515
- I figured I'd get them together.
- That's really nice.

38:30.683 --> 38:35.061
This kid's earned a trillion dollars.
He's got six gold records.

38:35.229 --> 38:39.733
Oh, I bought that Mozart trio
you recommended.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.902
The man showed me another one
you'd love.

38:43.070 --> 38:46.406
It's another Bach, Second Movement.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.866
- You have that one?
- Yeah.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.576
I would love to hear it.

38:49.744 --> 38:54.331
Holly met a wonderful man
who loves opera, an architect.

38:54.498 --> 38:58.251
That's nice. I'd love to see her
wind up settled.

38:58.419 --> 39:01.463
She's a tense one.

39:09.930 --> 39:11.931
Isn't that beautiful?

39:12.099 --> 39:13.725
I know this.

39:13.893 --> 39:18.396
Bach F Minor Concerto.
It's one of my favorites.

39:23.235 --> 39:26.279
Did you ever get around
to e.e. cummings?

39:26.447 --> 39:28.907
Yes, he's just adorable.

39:30.159 --> 39:34.496
They have a large gay clientele
where I get my teeth cleaned.

39:34.663 --> 39:38.291
All the hygienists now wear gloves.
They're afraid of AIDS.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.502
Right.

39:43.297 --> 39:47.092
Did you ever get around
to the poem on page 112?

39:48.052 --> 39:52.138
Yes, it made me cry.
It was so beautiful, so romantic.

39:54.141 --> 39:56.559
<i>I want so badly to kiss her.</i>

39:56.727 --> 40:00.313
<i>Not here. You've got to get</i>
<i>her alone someplace.</i>

40:00.481 --> 40:04.984
<i>But I've got to proceed cautiously.</i>
<i>This is a delicate situation.</i>

40:06.862 --> 40:10.323
<i>Ask her if you can see her</i>
<i>for lunch or a drink tomorrow.</i>

40:11.158 --> 40:14.786
<i>Make light of the offer</i>
<i>if she's unresponsive.</i>

40:14.954 --> 40:18.206
<i>This has to be done</i>
<i>skillfully and diplomatically.</i>

40:19.333 --> 40:21.334
Did you ever read this one?

40:23.254 --> 40:26.089
- Elliot, don't!
- Lee, I'm in love with you!

40:27.591 --> 40:29.384
What are you doing?

40:29.552 --> 40:32.929
I'm sorry, I have to talk to you.

40:33.097 --> 40:36.724
I've been in love with you so long...

40:37.893 --> 40:40.186
I don't have an interest
in selling it.

40:40.354 --> 40:43.565
I ask for some puce,
you fly off the handle!

40:43.732 --> 40:46.985
I'm not interested in what
your decorator thinks.

40:47.153 --> 40:51.489
I can't commit to anything
without consulting her first.

40:51.657 --> 40:56.161
You don't buy paintings
to blend in with the sofa.

40:56.328 --> 40:58.788
It's not a sofa. It's an ottoman!

40:58.956 --> 41:02.542
God, forget it.
Let's just get out of here.

41:03.752 --> 41:07.046
What a weirdo that guy is.
Paranoid.

41:08.382 --> 41:11.217
- What's the matter?
- I'll be OK.

41:11.385 --> 41:14.304
- Not that big a deal.
- You go on ahead.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.556
You're sweating.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.142
I just need fresh air.
Something I ate.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.769
I'll walk, you go ahead. You go.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.249
Hello. Hello?

41:44.752 --> 41:46.211
Hello!

41:55.095 --> 41:56.804
I was looking for you.

41:56.972 --> 41:59.599
I must apologize. I'm so mixed-up.

41:59.767 --> 42:04.229
- How do you expect me to react?
- But I'm in love with you.

42:04.396 --> 42:07.607
- Don't say those words.
- I know it's terrible.

42:07.775 --> 42:10.985
- You know the situation.
- I know. I realize.

42:11.153 --> 42:15.156
- What do you expect?
- Hannah and I are in the last stages.

42:15.324 --> 42:18.284
She's never said anything,
and we're very close.

42:18.452 --> 42:22.288
She's crazy about me,
but somewhere along the line

42:22.456 --> 42:23.957
I fell out of love.

42:24.124 --> 42:26.292
- Not because of me?
- No.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.585
Yes, I love you!

42:27.753 --> 42:30.797
I can't be the cause
of anything between you...

42:30.965 --> 42:32.632
It was inevitable.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.842
- Why?
- For a million reasons.

42:35.010 --> 42:36.094
But not over me?

42:36.262 --> 42:39.138
We were both going
in different directions.

42:39.306 --> 42:41.057
- Poor Hannah.
- How about you?

42:41.225 --> 42:45.311
Do you share any of my feelings,
or is this unpleasant?

42:45.479 --> 42:46.646
I can't say.

42:46.814 --> 42:49.399
Be candid.
I don't want you to feel bad.

42:49.567 --> 42:54.028
Yes, I have certain feelings for you.
Don't make me say more.

42:54.196 --> 42:58.491
OK, you've said enough.
I will work things out.

42:58.659 --> 43:02.412
Don't do anything on my behalf.
Hannah and I are close.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.998
But you do care about me?

43:05.165 --> 43:10.211
I can't be a party to this.
I'm racked with guilt talking to you.

43:10.379 --> 43:13.464
Your guilt is because
you feel the same.

43:13.632 --> 43:16.843
I have to go.
I have to get my teeth cleaned.

43:17.678 --> 43:21.806
I have my answer. I have my answer.

43:21.974 --> 43:24.183
I'm walking on air.

43:41.702 --> 43:43.745
Hi. How's she doing?

43:43.912 --> 43:47.081
She's in the kitchen.
It's the same thing.

43:47.249 --> 43:50.209
She promises. It's all lies.

43:50.377 --> 43:54.088
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Hi, Mom. How you doing?

43:54.256 --> 43:58.009
Let me get you some coffee.
What triggered it?

43:58.177 --> 44:02.513
We were making a commercial.
There was this young salesman.

44:02.681 --> 44:07.226
Your mother was throwing herself
at him in a disgusting way.

44:07.394 --> 44:12.440
When she found she was too old
to seduce, that he was embarrassed...

44:12.608 --> 44:14.067
Liar! Liar!

44:14.234 --> 44:17.278
And at lunch she got
drunker and drunker.

44:17.446 --> 44:19.489
Finally, she became Joan Collins!

44:19.657 --> 44:23.409
All my life I've put up with insults
from this nonperson.

44:23.577 --> 44:27.205
This haircut that passes for a man.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.332
He could never support us.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.126
I'm glad we had a talented daughter.

44:32.294 --> 44:34.879
I can only hope that she was mine.

44:35.047 --> 44:38.841
With you as her mother, her father
could be anybody in Actors' Equity!

44:39.009 --> 44:41.594
She's talented.
It's unlikely she's yours.

44:41.762 --> 44:45.306
Dad, could you please stay
in the other room?

44:45.474 --> 44:50.520
You never know when
she's gonna fall off the wagon.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.272
Here, Mom. Drink this.

44:53.440 --> 44:56.567
You're awful.
You probably were flirting.

44:56.735 --> 45:00.154
No, I like to joke around
and have fun.

45:00.322 --> 45:03.032
He gets angry because
I get the attention.

45:03.200 --> 45:08.121
He's gotten sour, and I've tried
to stay young at heart.

45:08.288 --> 45:10.456
You promised
to stay on the wagon.

45:10.624 --> 45:12.875
The sacrifices I've made.

45:13.043 --> 45:16.421
He's ruined me with his ego,
his philandering...

45:16.588 --> 45:20.550
- ...his mediocrity.
- OK, stop being so dramatic.

45:20.718 --> 45:24.303
He's the one that's laid
every ingénue in stock!

45:25.305 --> 45:29.308
They wanted me for a screen test,
but he'd get up there

45:29.476 --> 45:32.353
and he'd flounder around
with his expensive haircuts,

45:32.521 --> 45:35.148
hairdos and clothes.

45:35.315 --> 45:37.316
He's all show!

45:37.484 --> 45:41.821
How could you act when there's
nothing inside to come out?

45:53.000 --> 45:57.712
<i>She was so beautiful</i>
<i>at one time, and he was so dashing.</i>

45:57.880 --> 46:03.217
<i>Both of them just full of promise</i>
<i>and hopes that never materialized.</i>

46:04.011 --> 46:08.681
<i>And the fights and the infidelities</i>
<i>to prove themselves</i>

46:08.849 --> 46:12.435
<i>and blaming each other... it's so sad.</i>

46:12.603 --> 46:17.398
<i>They loved the idea of having us.</i>
<i>Raising us didn't interest them.</i>

46:17.566 --> 46:19.817
<i>But it's impossible</i>
<i>to hold it against them.</i>

46:19.985 --> 46:22.737
<i>They didn't know anything else.</i>

46:23.697 --> 46:26.199
Of all of us in the family,

46:26.366 --> 46:29.285
you're the one blessed
with the true gift.

46:29.453 --> 46:32.705
My true gift is luck.
I've had a lot of luck.

46:32.873 --> 46:37.418
From my first show. I thought Lee
was destined for great things.

46:37.586 --> 46:41.214
She's lovely,
but she doesn't have your spark.

46:41.381 --> 46:46.093
She knows it. She worships you.
She wouldn't dare get up on stage.

46:46.261 --> 46:48.513
Now, Holly's not shy.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.765
Holly's game for anything.

46:50.933 --> 46:52.850
- Holly takes after me.
- True.

46:53.018 --> 46:55.228
I'd have been a great dope addict.

46:55.395 --> 46:58.731
Remember this, Hannah?

48:21.940 --> 48:25.776
Mr. Sachs, I'm afraid
the news is not good.

48:27.821 --> 48:30.781
If I can show you
where the tumor is

48:30.949 --> 48:34.744
and why we feel that surgery
would be of no use.

48:34.912 --> 48:38.706
- See...
<i>- It's over.</i>

48:39.124 --> 48:42.418
<i>I'm face to face with eternity.</i>

48:42.586 --> 48:45.504
<i>Not later, but now.</i>

48:45.672 --> 48:50.718
<i>I'm so frightened,</i>
<i>I can't move or speak or breathe.</i>

48:52.888 --> 48:56.515
You're just fine.
There's nothing here at all.

48:56.683 --> 48:58.601
And your tests are all fine.

49:00.145 --> 49:04.231
I admit, I was concerned,
given your symptoms.

49:04.399 --> 49:07.526
What caused this hearing loss,
we'll never know.

49:07.694 --> 49:10.905
But whatever it was,
it's not anything serious.

49:11.073 --> 49:12.531
I'm very relieved.

49:29.591 --> 49:34.553
What do you mean, you're quitting?
Why? The news is good.

49:34.721 --> 49:37.515
You don't have cance... the thing.

49:37.683 --> 49:40.893
Do you realize what a thread
we're hanging by?

49:41.061 --> 49:43.604
Mickey, you're off the hook.
Celebrate!

49:43.772 --> 49:47.692
Can you understand
how meaningless everything is?

49:47.859 --> 49:50.778
Our lives, the show, the whole world.

49:50.946 --> 49:52.655
But you're not dying.

49:52.823 --> 49:57.243
I'm not now. When I ran
out of the hospital, I was so thrilled

49:57.411 --> 49:58.828
'cause they told me
I was gonna be all right.

49:58.996 --> 50:01.664
I'm running down the street
and then it hit me.

50:01.832 --> 50:05.876
So I'm not gonna go today, not tomorrow.

50:06.044 --> 50:08.546
But eventually I'm going to.

50:08.714 --> 50:10.715
You're realizing this now?

50:10.882 --> 50:13.134
I know it all the time,

50:13.301 --> 50:15.302
but I stick it
in the back of my mind.

50:15.470 --> 50:20.641
It's a horrible thing to think about.
Can I tell you something?

50:20.809 --> 50:23.894
- Yes, please.
- A week ago I bought a rifle.

50:24.062 --> 50:27.815
If I had a tumor,
I was gonna kill myself.

50:27.983 --> 50:30.026
The thing that might've stopped me is

50:30.193 --> 50:32.445
my parents would be devastated.

50:32.612 --> 50:37.283
I would've had to shoot them also.
And my aunt and uncle.

50:37.451 --> 50:41.746
Well, eventually, it is going
to happen to all of us.

50:41.913 --> 50:44.707
But doesn't that ruin
everything for you?

50:44.875 --> 50:46.959
It takes the pleasure away.

50:47.127 --> 50:51.213
You'll die, I'll die,
the audience, the network...

50:51.381 --> 50:53.549
- I know, and your hamster.
- Yes.

50:53.717 --> 50:57.011
Listen, kid,
I think you snapped your cap.

50:57.179 --> 50:59.764
Maybe you need
a few weeks in Bermuda.

50:59.931 --> 51:01.640
Or go to a whorehouse.

51:01.808 --> 51:03.809
I can't stay on. I need answers.

51:03.977 --> 51:07.938
Otherwise, I'm gonna
do something drastic.

51:26.958 --> 51:30.377
- I thought you weren't coming.
- I almost didn't.

51:31.505 --> 51:35.091
- I didn't sleep all night.
- No, I'm sure.

51:35.842 --> 51:39.053
What are we doing in a hotel room?
It's terrible.

51:39.221 --> 51:42.181
I couldn't think
where to invite you.

51:42.349 --> 51:46.185
I didn't want this to happen
till you were living alone.

51:46.353 --> 51:48.145
I was so torn when you called.

51:48.313 --> 51:52.525
I wanted to call every day
since I told you how I felt.

51:52.692 --> 51:55.194
I resisted so many times.

51:57.739 --> 51:59.824
Don't think badly of me.

52:02.661 --> 52:04.662
This is not an easy situation.

52:04.830 --> 52:06.664
I know it isn't.

52:23.890 --> 52:26.767
That was just perfect.

52:26.935 --> 52:29.436
You've ruined me for anyone else.

52:29.604 --> 52:32.273
I don't want anyone else
to have you.

52:33.817 --> 52:36.485
I worried I wouldn't
compare with Hannah.

52:36.653 --> 52:38.070
Oh, my God!

52:38.238 --> 52:42.741
- You really do have those thoughts?
- All the time.

52:42.909 --> 52:45.369
She must be a passionate person.

52:45.537 --> 52:47.872
Yes, she's very warm and giving.

52:48.039 --> 52:50.624
But I want to be giving to you.

52:50.792 --> 52:53.335
I wanna do things for you.

52:53.503 --> 52:55.880
Hannah doesn't need me as much.

52:57.048 --> 53:00.467
I'm being presumptuous.
Not that you need me.

53:00.635 --> 53:03.429
I want you to take care of me.

53:04.431 --> 53:07.349
And I love when you do things to me.

53:36.630 --> 53:37.963
You're late.

53:38.131 --> 53:41.508
I didn't realize how late
it had gotten.

53:42.802 --> 53:46.639
You missed a very dull TV show
about Auschwitz.

53:46.806 --> 53:48.557
More gruesome film clips.

53:48.725 --> 53:52.645
And more puzzled intellectuals
declaring their mystification

53:52.812 --> 53:55.648
over the systematic murder of millions.

53:55.815 --> 53:58.234
They can never answer the question,

53:58.401 --> 54:01.946
"How could it possibly happen?"
is that it's the wrong question.

54:02.113 --> 54:06.158
The question is,
"Why doesn't it happen more often?"

54:06.326 --> 54:08.244
Of course, it does, in subtler forms.

54:08.411 --> 54:10.704
I have a headache
from this weather.

54:14.834 --> 54:18.003
It's been ages since I sat
in front of the TV,

54:18.171 --> 54:20.923
changing channels
to find something.

54:21.091 --> 54:23.342
You see the whole culture.

54:23.510 --> 54:24.635
Nazis...

54:24.803 --> 54:26.679
...deodorant salesmen...

54:26.846 --> 54:28.180
...wrestlers...

54:28.348 --> 54:30.683
...beauty contests, the talk show.

54:30.850 --> 54:34.645
Can you imagine the mind
that watches wrestling?

54:34.813 --> 54:38.065
But the worst are
the fundamentalist preachers.

54:38.233 --> 54:39.858
Third-rate con men

54:40.026 --> 54:43.570
telling the suckers
that they speak for Jesus

54:43.738 --> 54:47.241
and to please send in money.
Money, money, money.

54:47.409 --> 54:51.620
If Jesus came back and saw
what's going on in his name,

54:51.788 --> 54:53.205
he'd never stop throwing up.

54:53.373 --> 54:56.041
Frederick, could you please
lighten up?

54:56.209 --> 55:00.671
I'm not in the mood to hear
a review of contemporary society.

55:01.756 --> 55:03.590
You've been nervous lately.

55:03.758 --> 55:05.551
I can't take this anymore.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.679
I'm only completing
an education I started.

55:08.847 --> 55:11.223
I'm not your pupil. I was.

55:11.391 --> 55:15.060
When you leave the nest,
I want you to be ready.

55:15.228 --> 55:18.063
- We have to make some changes.
- Like what?

55:18.231 --> 55:22.067
- You know. I'm suffocating.
- This conversation again?

55:22.235 --> 55:26.989
Yes, this conversation again.
I have to leave, I have to move out.

55:27.157 --> 55:29.616
- Why?
- Because I have to.

55:29.784 --> 55:31.702
What'll you use for money?

55:31.870 --> 55:35.372
I thought maybe I'd move
in with my parents.

55:35.540 --> 55:38.250
I always told you
you would leave me.

55:38.418 --> 55:40.419
Does it have to be now?

55:40.587 --> 55:43.714
Maybe it'll be temporary.
But I have to try.

55:44.841 --> 55:47.760
Lee, you're my whole world.

55:50.680 --> 55:53.432
Good God.
Have you been kissed tonight?

55:53.600 --> 55:56.560
- No...
- Yes, you have.

55:56.728 --> 55:59.396
- You've been with someone!
- Stop accusing me!

55:59.564 --> 56:01.940
I'm too smart. You can't fool me!

56:02.108 --> 56:03.776
- You're turning red!
- Leave me alone!

56:03.943 --> 56:06.820
Oh, Christ! What's wrong with you?

56:09.449 --> 56:10.783
I'm sorry.

56:10.950 --> 56:13.660
Couldn't you say something?
You slither...

56:13.828 --> 56:15.829
I'm saying it now!

56:15.997 --> 56:17.873
So you met somebody else?

56:19.084 --> 56:22.628
Yeah. You knew that was going
to happen sooner or later.

56:22.796 --> 56:25.672
- I can't live like this.
- Who is it?

56:25.840 --> 56:29.343
- It's just somebody I met.
- Where did you meet him?

56:29.511 --> 56:32.262
It doesn't matter.
I have to move out.

56:32.430 --> 56:34.890
You're my connection to the world.

56:35.058 --> 56:38.977
That's too much responsibility
for me. It's not fair.

56:39.145 --> 56:41.146
I want a less complicated life.

56:41.314 --> 56:44.024
I want a child, before it's too late.

56:44.192 --> 56:46.360
Jesus. Jesus!

56:46.528 --> 56:49.279
Oh, God, I don't even
know what I want.

56:52.075 --> 56:55.452
What do you get out of me,
anyway? I mean...

56:56.955 --> 56:59.623
It's not sexual anymore.

57:00.291 --> 57:04.503
It's certainly not intellectual.
You're so superior to me.

57:04.671 --> 57:06.672
Don't patronize me!

57:07.841 --> 57:13.178
God! I should have married you...
years ago when you wanted to.

57:13.346 --> 57:14.430
I should've agreed.

57:14.597 --> 57:17.683
Don't you know?
It never would've worked.

57:19.310 --> 57:23.272
I told you one day you'd leave
me for a younger man.

57:34.492 --> 57:36.743
<i>What passion today with Lee.</i>

57:36.911 --> 57:39.121
<i>She's a volcano.</i>

57:39.289 --> 57:43.542
<i>It was totally fulfilling,</i>
<i>just as I'd dreamed it'd be.</i>

57:43.710 --> 57:44.918
<i>That's what it was.</i>

57:45.086 --> 57:49.298
<i>It was like living out a dream,</i>
<i>a great dream.</i>

57:49.466 --> 57:53.093
<i>Now I feel very good and cozy</i>
<i>next to Hannah.</i>

57:53.261 --> 57:55.804
<i>Hannah is very real and lovely.</i>

57:55.972 --> 58:00.350
<i>She gives me a very deep feeling</i>
<i>of being part of something.</i>

58:00.518 --> 58:04.563
<i>She's a wonderful woman,</i>
<i>and I betrayed her.</i>

58:04.731 --> 58:07.274
<i>She changed my empty life,</i>

58:07.442 --> 58:11.236
<i>and I paid her back</i>
<i>by banging her sister.</i>

58:11.404 --> 58:15.240
<i>God, I'm despicable!</i>
<i>What a cruel and shallow act.</i>

58:15.408 --> 58:18.076
<i>I have call her now and tell her</i>
<i>what we did was crazy.</i>

58:18.244 --> 58:22.331
<i>It can't ever happen again.</i>
<i>I value Hannah too much.</i>

58:22.499 --> 58:26.418
<i>I love my wife. Now I betrayed her.</i>
<i>Oh, God!</i>

58:26.586 --> 58:27.920
Where are you going?

58:28.087 --> 58:32.424
I've gotta get a phone number.
I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.

58:32.592 --> 58:35.552
- It's late.
- Yes, I can't believe I forgot.

58:36.262 --> 58:37.763
What if he answers?

58:37.931 --> 58:39.264
I'll hang up.

58:39.432 --> 58:42.768
I'll say we can't communicate
until I'm divorced.

58:42.936 --> 58:45.521
It's immoral. Then time will pass.

58:45.688 --> 58:48.106
I won't call,
and she'll understand.

58:48.274 --> 58:51.318
I've gotta stop
before I get in too deep.

58:51.486 --> 58:54.530
I'd rather hurt Lee a little
than destroy Hannah.

58:54.697 --> 58:56.365
It's1:30.

58:56.533 --> 59:00.369
She can't have a conversation
with me, with him around.

59:00.537 --> 59:02.329
I'm getting hysterical.

59:02.497 --> 59:04.957
I'll call her in the morning.

59:05.124 --> 59:06.708
I'll call her at 6:00.

59:06.876 --> 59:09.294
Frederick goes jogging at 6:00.

59:09.462 --> 59:12.923
She'll be alone. I'll call
and nip it in the bud.

59:13.091 --> 59:15.259
I've got it! I've got it!

59:15.969 --> 59:17.052
Hello.

59:17.720 --> 59:19.304
Mel!

59:19.472 --> 59:22.849
I'd have hung up
if you hadn't answered,

59:23.017 --> 59:25.018
but I had to tell you...

59:25.186 --> 59:29.147
...I feel very close to you tonight.
Very, very close.

59:29.315 --> 59:30.983
Good night.

59:44.831 --> 59:48.625
<i>Millions of books written</i>
<i>on every conceivable subject</i>

59:56.759 --> 59:58.635
<i>I read Socrates.</i>

59:58.803 --> 01:00:01.847
<i>He used to knock off</i>

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:04.516
<i>What the hell's</i>
<i>he got to teach me?</i>

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:08.478
<i>And Nietzsche, with his theory</i>
<i>of eternal recurrence.</i>

01:00:08.646 --> 01:00:12.357
<i>He said the life we live,</i>
<i>we'll live over and over,</i>

01:00:12.525 --> 01:00:14.735
<i>the same way for eternity.</i>

01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:18.697
<i>Great. I'll have to sit</i>

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.532
<i>It's not worth it.</i>

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.160
<i>And Freud, another great pessimist.</i>

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:26.705
<i>I was in analysis for years.</i>
<i>Nothing happened.</i>

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:29.207
<i>My poor analyst got so frustrated,</i>

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:32.210

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:34.212

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:38.216

01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:40.886
<i>It's so sad</i>
<i>what people go through</i>

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:44.222
<i>with their stationary bike</i>
<i>and their exercise.</i>

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:47.434
<i>Oh, look at this one. Poor thing.</i>

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:50.103

01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:53.065

- Yeah. OK.

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.523
Are you in a bad mood?

01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:48.360
I don't know. I'm just antsy.

01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:51.655
The last few weeks,
you haven't been yourself.

01:05:51.822 --> 01:05:55.033
And tonight at dinner,
you were curt with me.

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:57.202
- Was I?
- Yes, you were.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:00.205
When I brought up the idea
of having a baby,

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:01.915
you jumped down my throat.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:05.126
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- Why not?

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:07.879
It's the last thing we need right now.

01:06:08.714 --> 01:06:10.966
Why? Is there something wrong?

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:14.010
- I don't know.
- Should I be worried?

01:06:14.178 --> 01:06:16.304
Well, you got four children.

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:18.139
I want one with you.

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:22.394
I think we should wait
till things settle.

01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:24.688
What does that mean?

01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:28.358
We've been married four years.
How settled can it get?

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:32.445
You have set plans on how
your life should be structured:

01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:36.282
a house, kids, certain schools,
a home in Connecticut.

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.743
It's all very preconceived.

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:42.247
Yeah, but I...
I thought you needed that.

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:44.833
You said your life was chaos.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:48.253
But there's got to be
some give and take.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:51.881
I don't know what the hell
I'm talking about.

01:06:52.591 --> 01:06:54.968
- Are you angry with me?
- No.

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:58.763
Do you feel...? Are you disenchanted
with our marriage?

01:06:58.931 --> 01:07:00.015
I didn't say that.

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:01.766
Is there someone else?

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:05.186
What is this? The Gestapo? No.

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:07.188

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:08.523
What kind of...?

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:11.317
Supposing I said I am disenchanted.

01:07:11.485 --> 01:07:14.195
- I am in love with someone else.
- Are you?

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:15.613
No.

01:07:15.781 --> 01:07:20.702
You keep asking these questions.
It's like you want me to say yes.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:24.622
What are you saying?
Of course not. I'd be destroyed.

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:27.709
<i>For chrissake, stop torturing her.</i>

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:30.628
<i>Say you want out</i>
<i>and get it over with.</i>

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:32.297
<i>You love her sister.</i>

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.632
<i>You didn't do it on purpose.</i>

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.761
<i>Be honest. It's always the best way.</i>

01:07:37.928 --> 01:07:40.472
How can I help you?

01:07:40.639 --> 01:07:44.350
If you're suffering over something,
share it with me.

01:07:46.812 --> 01:07:48.938
You know how much I love you.

01:07:51.108 --> 01:07:54.736
I should have my head examined.
I don't deserve you.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:06.706
I wanna look good,
but I don't want to be overdressed.

01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:11.669
- How about this?
- I think it's a pretty color on you.

01:08:11.837 --> 01:08:15.131
Ever think you'd see me
going to the opera?

01:08:15.299 --> 01:08:17.466
It's great. I want to meet him.

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:21.970
He's married. And
his wife's schizophrenic.

01:08:22.139 --> 01:08:24.974
Sometimes she just breaks down.

01:08:25.142 --> 01:08:28.228
When his daughter
goes to college next year,

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:30.229
he'll split permanently.

01:08:30.397 --> 01:08:33.899
His wife helped put him
through architecture school.

01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:36.361
You found all this out
on one date?

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:39.863
I think he was dying
to open up. It's so sad.

01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:43.033
Now what should I wear
to my audition?

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:45.953
I've got an audition
for a Broadway musical.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.287
I'll never get it.

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:50.250
- Singing?
- Can you believe it?

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:54.045
I mean, why not?
What have I got to lose?

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:55.546
No, I just...

01:08:55.714 --> 01:08:58.841
No, I didn't know you sang.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.470
You think everybody
in musicals sings well?

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:05.723
No, it's just that they sing.

01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:07.892
Well, you know.

01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:11.729

01:09:11.897 --> 01:09:14.399
I know. No, I know.

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.651
Don't say it that way.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:20.404
- Confidence isn't my strong point.
- I didn't mean that.

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:24.367
I think I can fake my way
through a song. Easily.

01:09:26.745 --> 01:09:30.331
- Why? You don't think it's realistic?
- No, I didn't... No.

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:34.919
No, I just hate to see you
put yourself in a position

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.421
where you get hurt.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:38.840
You take every single rejection

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:42.594
as confirmation
that you have no talent.

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:45.305
- Well, maybe I'll get it.
- I hope.

01:09:45.471 --> 01:09:46.930
Boy...

01:09:47.099 --> 01:09:49.600

- What?

01:09:49.768 --> 01:09:51.769
Can't I say anything?

01:09:51.937 --> 01:09:55.315
I sing. For chrissake,
you heard me sing!

01:09:55.482 --> 01:09:56.900
OK, I...

01:09:57.067 --> 01:10:00.361
What happened?
We were having a nice time

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:03.698

went to bad feeling.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:06.451

01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:25.405
<i>♪ When the world is cold</i>

01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:27.699
<i>♪ I will get a glow</i>

01:11:27.866 --> 01:11:32.036
<i>♪ Just thinking of you</i>

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:42.255
You sounded great.
You may be surprised.

01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:45.717
I'm just glad we have
a catering job this week.

01:11:45.884 --> 01:11:49.804
We have Mr. Levine's 80th
birthday on Riverside Drive.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:52.974
Or the chapel,
depending on his health.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.685
Listen. David called me up.

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:58.896
- What?
- David called me last night.

01:11:59.064 --> 01:12:01.482
He wants to take me
to the opera.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.276
I didn't know what to say.

01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:04.527
You're joking.

01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:06.904
No, he called late last night.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.992
I'm very surprised.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.786
He wants to take me
<i>to see Rigoletto.</i>

01:12:13.954 --> 01:12:15.830
And you're going.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:19.459
I didn't know what to say.
At first I said no.

01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:24.088
He said he'd taken you once,
and he really wanted to invite me.

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:28.801
- But I'm seeing him.
- I know. I said that...

01:12:28.969 --> 01:12:32.388
...but he said he really
wanted to do it.

01:12:35.976 --> 01:12:37.935
I don't know what to say.

01:12:38.103 --> 01:12:42.523
It's just an evening at the opera.
Did I do wrong in accepting?

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.817
Huh?

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:53.993
Why would you like to convert
to Catholicism?

01:12:54.161 --> 01:12:58.748
I have to believe in something
or else life is just meaningless.

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:01.250
But why did you make
the decision

01:13:01.418 --> 01:13:03.711
to choose the Catholic faith?

01:13:04.254 --> 01:13:07.965
First of all, because it's
a very beautiful religion.

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:10.385
It's strong and well-structured.

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:13.179
I'm talking about the against
school prayer,

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:14.889
pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing.

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:17.225
So you don't believe in God?

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.268
No, and I want to.

01:13:19.436 --> 01:13:22.438
I'll do anything.
I'll dye Easter eggs.

01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:25.817
I need some evidence.
I gotta have proof.

01:13:25.984 --> 01:13:29.028
If I can't believe,
life isn't worth living.

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:31.030
It's a very big leap.

01:13:31.198 --> 01:13:33.366
Yes, well, can you help me?

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:39.122
I don't understand.
I thought you'd be happy.

01:13:39.289 --> 01:13:40.832
How can we be happy?

01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:44.127
Because I'm giving God
serious thought.

01:13:44.294 --> 01:13:49.674
- Catholicism? Why not your own people?
- I got off on the wrong foot there.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.551
I need a dramatic change.

01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:55.513
- You'll believe in Jesus Christ?
- I'm gonna try.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:59.142
- We raised you as a Jew.
- I was born that way...

01:13:59.309 --> 01:14:02.353
- I'm older now.
- But why Jesus Christ?

01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:04.605
Why not become a Buddhist?

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:06.691
That's totally alien to me.

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:09.152
Aren't you afraid of dying?

01:14:09.319 --> 01:14:10.653
Why be afraid?

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:12.405
- You won't exist.
- So?

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:17.034
- That doesn't terrify you?
- I'm alive. When I'm dead, I'm dead.

01:14:17.202 --> 01:14:18.870
Aren't you frightened?

01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:22.248
- I'll be unconscious.
- But never to exist again?

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:25.293
- How do you know?
- It doesn't look promising.

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:27.044
Who knows what'll be?

01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:29.797
I'll either be unconscious,
or I won't.

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:33.259
If not, I'll deal with it then.
I won't worry now.

01:14:33.427 --> 01:14:34.594
Mom, come out.

01:14:34.761 --> 01:14:39.015
Of course there's a God, you idiot.
You don't believe in God?

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:42.143
Then why is there so much evil
in the world?

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:45.021
On a simple level,
why were there Nazis?

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:46.397
Tell him, Max.

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.232
How the hell do I know?

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.943
I don't know how
the can opener works.

01:16:15.445 --> 01:16:19.657
- Hi. Where's Holly?
- She's auditioning for a commercial.

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:24.203
- How's she doing?
- You know Holly when she's depressed.

01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:26.747
It's good
that we invited her to lunch.

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.708
Tell her it was your idea.

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:32.003
When I try to help,
she gets defensive.

01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:35.256
She's just embarrassed
in front of you.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.300
- So how are you?
- I'm OK.

01:16:37.467 --> 01:16:39.093
Do you miss Frederick?

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:42.138
Elliot and I must know
someone for you.

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:46.058
How are you?
How's Frederick...

01:16:46.226 --> 01:16:48.352
He's fine. I guess he's fine.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:53.441
He's been moody the last few months.
I don't know what it is.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:54.942
He's kind of distant.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:57.862
I try talking...
He says everything's fine.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:00.823
Automatically, I think the worst.

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:04.493
- He's seeing someone else.
- No, everyone thinks that.

01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:09.415
I just came from an audition which
I did not get. So what's new?

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:13.711
They said I was too offbeat-looking,
whatever that means.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:16.631
- But guess who's auditioning?
- April?

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:21.385
I was very polite. I maintained
my poise. I said hello.

01:17:21.553 --> 01:17:24.680
I never trusted her.
Eyes in the back of her head.

01:17:24.848 --> 01:17:30.019
She and an architect are now
a definite item, which I can't believe.

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:33.481
Though it's put an end
to the catering company.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:38.611
Which is why I have to speak to you.
I have to borrow more money.

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:42.239
- That's fine.
- I decided to do some writing.

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:44.075
I've had it with acting.

01:17:44.242 --> 01:17:48.579
These meaningless auditions.
I can't handle another rejection.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:53.250
Let's face it. I have to latch
on to something in my life,

01:17:53.418 --> 01:17:57.004
something with a future.
I'm not16 anymore.

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:58.756
It's just crazy.

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:03.803
But I've got an idea for a story,
more than one,

01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:07.598
and I just need a few months
or a year even.

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:11.394
I learned about dramatic
structure from acting class.

01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:16.774
That's good. It just seems to me
that six months or a year,

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:20.778
- if you spend it more productively...
- Like what?

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:22.738
Well, I don't know.

01:18:22.906 --> 01:18:27.159
Didn't mom mention something
at the Museum of Broadcasting?

01:18:27.327 --> 01:18:31.914
- That's clerical.
- Didn't she say it's in publicity?

01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:35.292
- It can lead to other things.
- You're discouraging.

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.628
No, I'm trying to be helpful.

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:39.630
A person doesn't say,

01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:42.800
"I'm done as an actress.
Now I'm a writer."

01:18:42.968 --> 01:18:45.594
- Not at my age.
- Please. Let's have lunch.

01:18:45.762 --> 01:18:48.597
Right. Forget it.

01:18:49.349 --> 01:18:52.935
I just want a salad.
You really think I'm a loser.

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:55.396
- You're being ridiculous.
- You are.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.815
- You treat me like a loser.
- How?

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:01.318
You have no faith.
You undercut my enthusiasm.

01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:02.486
Not so.

01:19:02.654 --> 01:19:04.071
I've been very supportive.

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:09.076
I give you honest, constructive
advice. I help you financially.

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:12.872
I introduce you
to interesting, single men.

01:19:13.039 --> 01:19:15.499
- All losers.
- You're too demanding.

01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:19.086
Who you fix me up with
says what you think of me.

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:21.505
- That's not true.
- I'm mediocre.

01:19:21.673 --> 01:19:25.009
Stop attacking Hannah.
She's going through a lot.

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:28.763
- Why are you so upset?
- You keep picking on her.

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:31.182
Leave her alone. I'm suffocating.

01:19:31.349 --> 01:19:34.518
Why are you so sensitive
all of a sudden?

01:19:34.686 --> 01:19:36.854
Look, you wanna write, write.

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:39.273
Let's just drop it.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:43.027
Take a year. Take six months,
whatever you want.

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:46.822
Who knows? Maybe you'll be
sitting with a good play.

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:50.785
What's the matter?
You look pale. Are you OK?

01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:55.247
Yeah. You know,
I just got dizzy all of a sudden.

01:19:55.415 --> 01:19:58.209
I think we need to eat.

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:16.477
I can't seem to take action.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:19.897
I'm like Hamlet
unable to kill his uncle.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:23.859
I want Lee, but I can't harm Hannah.

01:20:24.027 --> 01:20:28.614
And in no other area
am I a procrastinator.

01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:31.575
<i>Meanwhile, Lee has no direction.</i>

01:20:31.743 --> 01:20:35.287
<i>She's taking courses</i>
<i>at Columbia, but just randomly.</i>

01:20:35.455 --> 01:20:40.793
<i>I try not to call her, but then</i>
<i>she calls me, and then I call,</i>

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:44.880
<i>and we try to resist meeting,</i>
<i>but sometimes we meet.</i>

01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:48.634
<i>Sometimes we argue because</i>
<i>I can't split my marriage.</i>

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:53.681
<i>Sometimes we wind up making love,</i>
<i>and we both feel terrible.</i>

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.933
But it's my fault.

01:20:57.435 --> 01:21:01.772
For all my education, accomplishments,
and so-called wisdom,

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:05.192
I can't fathom my own heart.

01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:12.157
You'd like to become a Hare Krishna?

01:21:12.325 --> 01:21:14.451
I'm not saying I wanna join,

01:21:14.619 --> 01:21:18.038
but you believe in reincarnation,
so I'm interested.

01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:19.665
What's your religion?

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:23.794
I was born Jewish,
but last winter I tried Catholicism.

01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:29.008
It didn't work for me.
I studied and tried, but for me it was,

01:21:29.175 --> 01:21:30.718
"Die now, pay later."

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:34.763
- I just couldn't get with it.
- You're afraid of dying?

01:21:34.931 --> 01:21:37.766
Yeah, naturally. In reincarnation,

01:21:37.934 --> 01:21:40.811
does my soul
pass to another human?

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:43.647
Or would I come back
as an aardvark?

01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:47.985
Take our literature, read it over,
and think about it.

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:51.822
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Hare Krishna.

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:58.078
<i>Who are you kidding?</i>
<i>You're gonna be a Krishna?</i>

01:21:58.246 --> 01:22:02.166
<i>You're gonna shave your head</i>
<i>and dance around at airports?</i>

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:04.376
<i>You'd look like Jerry Lewis.</i>

01:22:04.544 --> 01:22:07.212
<i>Oh, God, I'm so depressed.</i>

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:20.017
<i>The nights are really getting cooler.</i>

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:22.561
<i>Summer went so quickly.</i>

01:22:22.979 --> 01:22:24.897
<i>Soon it'll be fall.</i>

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:29.026
<i>My literature professor</i>
<i>really likes me.</i>

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:31.862
<i>It was fun being out with him</i>
<i>last night.</i>

01:22:32.405 --> 01:22:36.367
<i>I feel like I'm betraying</i>
<i>Elliot, but that's ridiculous.</i>

01:22:36.534 --> 01:22:40.079
<i>Why shouldn't I see Doug?</i>
<i>Elliot's not free.</i>

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:43.832
<i>Just go one step at a time.</i>

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:47.211
<i>Let's see what the next</i>
<i>few months bring.</i>

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:50.172
Hannah? Hi!

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:55.010
You'll be happy to know that
your money hasn't gone to waste.

01:22:55.178 --> 01:22:59.473
I have an actual first rough draft
of something I wrote.

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:01.058
Yeah.

01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:04.353
I showed it to Lee.
She gave me some pointers.

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:08.607
I'm pretty near where you live.
Could I just drop it off?

01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:11.068
And when you have time, read it,

01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:13.487
and we'll talk over Thanksgiving.

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:17.449
OK? All right. Wait. Listen!

01:23:17.617 --> 01:23:20.411
Lee met an interesting guy
at Columbia.

01:23:20.578 --> 01:23:23.998
Yeah, yeah.
Well, he sounds really nice.

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:27.084
All right. We'll talk at Thanksgiving.

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:28.585
Bye-bye.

01:23:30.255 --> 01:23:33.716
Here's a song that Norma sang

01:23:33.883 --> 01:23:36.927
on that trip we made
to the show in Buffalo.

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:39.763
Oh, was she beautiful that night!

01:23:39.931 --> 01:23:40.931
Come on.

01:23:41.099 --> 01:23:43.892
You were.
Don't you remember that night?

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:46.729
She was so beautiful...

01:23:46.896 --> 01:23:49.231
...that when men saw her walking,

01:23:49.399 --> 01:23:52.568
they'd drive their cars
up on the sidewalk.

01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:54.486
That right, honey?

01:23:54.654 --> 01:23:58.032
A slight exaggeration,
but only slight.

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:28.645
- You've been very cold to me tonight.
- No!

01:24:28.813 --> 01:24:30.814
Is something wrong?

01:24:31.316 --> 01:24:34.443
Not here. There are too many
people around.

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:38.072
Hey, Hannah?

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:41.492
I think Lee's serious
about her new boyfriend.

01:24:41.659 --> 01:24:43.994
He sounds really nice.

01:24:44.162 --> 01:24:46.830
I'm happy for her.
I think she's in love.

01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:48.415
What's wrong?

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:51.001
I'm upset about what you wrote.

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:52.211
My script?

01:24:52.378 --> 01:24:54.922
- It's based on Elliot and me.
- Loosely.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:58.842
Not loosely. Real specifically.
Is that how you see us?

01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:02.554
Can I not accept gestures
and feelings from people?

01:25:02.722 --> 01:25:04.348
Do I put people off?

01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:06.934
- It's a made-up story.
- No, it's exact.

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:09.770
The situations,
the dialogue, everything.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:12.606
It's full of details
about Elliot and me,

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:16.026
which I don't see how
you could know about.

01:25:16.194 --> 01:25:18.362
Our conversation about adoption?

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:19.863
Lee mentioned that to me.

01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:24.618
Obviously, you told her.
I just blew it up into drama.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:28.413
How would Lee know?
We don't talk about everything.

01:25:28.581 --> 01:25:30.415
I guess I hit a nerve.

01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:35.129
You make it out like I have no needs.
Am I too self-sufficient?

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:37.756
That's not what I meant.

01:25:37.924 --> 01:25:40.134
Everybody relies on you for so much.

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:41.844
It's not a criticism.

01:25:42.011 --> 01:25:45.305
- We're grateful.
- Grateful, but you resent me.

01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:48.100
I don't wanna have
this conversation.

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:52.479
I didn't do anything wrong.
You said you were having problems.

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:55.232
Problems that are my business,

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.860
which I don't see how you know.

01:25:58.027 --> 01:26:01.655
How does Lee know about these things?
They're private.

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:04.032
Why don't you share them with us?

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:08.370
- I don't want to bother everyone.
- I'd like to be bothered.

01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:12.249
I don't see how you could know
unless Elliot told you.

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:14.126
No, he hasn't.

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:16.670
If I offended you, I'm sorry.

01:26:19.215 --> 01:26:22.217
It's over, Elliot.
I can't be any clearer.

01:26:22.385 --> 01:26:25.053
- I deserve this...
- I'm at fault too.

01:26:25.221 --> 01:26:27.222
I have such feelings...

01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:29.892
To be honest,
I've met someone else.

01:26:30.059 --> 01:26:34.605
- What do you mean?
- I said I wasn't gonna wait forever.

01:26:34.772 --> 01:26:36.565
It hasn't been forever.

01:26:36.733 --> 01:26:40.527
It's been a year and you're
still married to my sister.

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:43.947
And I'm sure you're more
in love than you know.

01:26:44.115 --> 01:26:47.993
- But we made so many plans.
- In a way, you led me on.

01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:50.954
I believed you were
unhappy with Hannah.

01:26:51.122 --> 01:26:53.707
I would never have
let myself be drawn in.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:57.419
I was weak. So were you.
Now I've met someone else.

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.256
Dinner soon?

01:27:01.424 --> 01:27:05.052
- About15 minutes.
- Good.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:08.722
- You're in love overnight?
- I care a lot about him.

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:11.642
It's over, Elliot.
I mean it. It's over.

01:27:15.647 --> 01:27:19.399
Sweetheart, I loved your script.
It was so clever.

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:22.444
You're my mother.
Not everybody's a sucker.

01:27:22.612 --> 01:27:25.572
I really liked the character
of the mother.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.617
A boozy old flirt
with a filthy mouth.

01:27:28.785 --> 01:27:31.828
- I'm so proud.
- Oh, Mom. Thanks.

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:34.331
A toast to Thanksgiving!

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:37.084
Are we supposed
to have beer? Yeah!

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:38.293
Let me hear it!

01:27:38.461 --> 01:27:40.254
How's that, Fletcher?

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:43.548
Now to Thanksgiving.
Here's a little toast.

01:27:43.716 --> 01:27:44.716
Bottoms up!

01:27:44.884 --> 01:27:49.346
Have you been talking to Holly
or Lee about our personal life?

01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:51.098
Me? Of course not.

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.350
There's things in Holly's script

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:56.353
that could only have come from you.

01:27:56.521 --> 01:27:59.231
Look, I don't like being accused.

01:27:59.399 --> 01:28:03.735
I'm not accusing. I'm asking.
Do you find me too giving?

01:28:03.903 --> 01:28:05.570
Too competent?

01:28:05.738 --> 01:28:08.740
- Too disgustingly perfect or something?
- No.

01:28:08.908 --> 01:28:12.202
What's come between us?
How have I alienated you?

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:15.914
- My head is throbbing.
- You never want to talk about it.

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:19.668
When I bring it up,
you change the subject.

01:28:19.836 --> 01:28:22.838
We communicate less.
You sleep with me less.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:25.882
Hannah, I am very mixed-up!
Please!

01:28:26.050 --> 01:28:29.594
Do you talk to Holly or Lee
behind my back?

01:28:29.762 --> 01:28:31.805
They seem to know so much.

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:34.933
Maybe I've asked advice
or made a joke.

01:28:35.101 --> 01:28:38.895
Do you talk to Holly? Lee?
Or what? Do you phone them?

01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:40.981
Leave me alone, can you?

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:44.276
Jesus, I told you.
I need someone I can matter to.

01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:46.737
You matter to me. Completely.

01:28:46.904 --> 01:28:51.074
I can't be around someone who
gives so much yet needs so little.

01:28:51.242 --> 01:28:52.784
I have enormous needs.

01:28:52.952 --> 01:28:56.121
I can't see them,
neither can Lee or Holly.

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:59.810
It's so pitch-black tonight.

01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:03.814
I feel lost.

01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:06.691
You're not lost.

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:18.745
I love you so much.

01:31:08.921 --> 01:31:10.547
You may not remember,

01:31:10.715 --> 01:31:13.383
but we shared the worst
night of my life.

01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:15.051
I remember you.

01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:17.554
You recall? I saw you in here.

01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:21.224
- I thought we could replay...
- We didn't hit it off.

01:31:21.392 --> 01:31:24.102
We did everything
but exchange gunshots.

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:27.314
- How are you?
- Good. You look wonderful.

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:30.108
You do. It was a terrible evening.

01:31:30.276 --> 01:31:33.195
Remember slamming
the cab door in my face?

01:31:33.362 --> 01:31:38.283
You came very dangerously close
to emasculating my nose.

01:31:38.451 --> 01:31:41.286
That was a long time ago.
People change.

01:31:41.454 --> 01:31:43.872
- I hope you've changed.
- You too.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:47.125
Your personality left something
to be desired,

01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:49.294
namely a personality.

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:52.047
How are you? What are you doing?

01:31:52.215 --> 01:31:56.092
Nothing much.
A little of this, a little of that.

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:59.888
Was that an embarrassing question?
You're out of work?

01:32:00.056 --> 01:32:02.682
- I've been trying to write.
- Have you?

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:04.976
- Yeah.
- What kind of stuff?

01:32:05.144 --> 01:32:09.105
- You're not interested in this.
- You can tell me. I am.

01:32:09.273 --> 01:32:12.108
You must always hear,
"I wrote something."

01:32:12.276 --> 01:32:14.277
- Nobody ever said it.
- Really?

01:32:14.445 --> 01:32:17.739
Would you be willing
to read something I wrote?

01:32:17.907 --> 01:32:22.035
If it would mean anything to you.
I don't know why it would.

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:25.956
- You've always hated my taste.
- No, I haven't.

01:32:26.123 --> 01:32:29.459
I think it might be
a great television script,

01:32:29.627 --> 01:32:31.795
and since you're so active...

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:34.506
I haven't been
in television for a year.

01:32:34.674 --> 01:32:36.299
You're kidding me.

01:32:36.467 --> 01:32:39.010
I may have to get back into it.

01:32:39.178 --> 01:32:41.638
I'm running out of dollars.

01:32:41.806 --> 01:32:45.809
But I dropped out for a year,
which is a long, dull story.

01:32:45.977 --> 01:32:48.478
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:49.938
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:32:50.106 --> 01:32:51.314
So, your script?

01:32:51.482 --> 01:32:54.693
If you'd read it,
I'd value your opinion.

01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:58.655
But remember while you're reading
and cursing my name,

01:32:58.823 --> 01:33:01.825
it's my first script.
Well, not really.

01:33:01.993 --> 01:33:04.869
My first was about
Hannah and her husband.

01:33:05.037 --> 01:33:07.914
But Hannah read it
and got really angry.

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:10.166
Can't imagine what you wrote.

01:33:10.334 --> 01:33:13.461
It wasn't anything bad.
She... I don't know.

01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:16.673
So I threw it out,
but I have this other one.

01:33:16.841 --> 01:33:20.093
If you want me to, I'll read it.

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:23.179
Could I come over and read it to you?

01:33:23.347 --> 01:33:27.225
Come over and read it to me?
You must be joking.

01:33:27.393 --> 01:33:30.478
I've done my own reading
since I was 40.

01:33:30.646 --> 01:33:33.690
I think it's lucky
I ran into you. Maybe.

01:33:33.858 --> 01:33:35.442
What about me?

01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:38.903
I have this sensation
that I should have

01:33:39.071 --> 01:33:42.282
kept walking and not begun
this conversation.

01:33:43.534 --> 01:33:46.202
"We all play with the hand
we're dealt."

01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:49.539
And what hand were you dealt?"

01:33:49.749 --> 01:33:52.250
I'm two high pair.

01:33:52.418 --> 01:33:54.336
Maybe even aces up.

01:33:54.503 --> 01:33:57.631
The problem is,
you've got three deuces."

01:33:58.924 --> 01:34:00.383
That's the end.

01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:04.721
No, you can tell me straight.
It's OK.

01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:07.057
Just tell me what you think.

01:34:07.224 --> 01:34:08.808
It's great.

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.435
I... I'm...

01:34:10.603 --> 01:34:13.396
I'm speechless. I was...

01:34:13.564 --> 01:34:17.442
I was not in the mood
to listen to this thing now.

01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:21.279
I don't know what to say.
I'm moved. I laughed.

01:34:21.447 --> 01:34:24.908
I was on the edge of my seat.
I think it's wonderful.

01:34:25.076 --> 01:34:26.576
I'm totally stunned.

01:34:26.744 --> 01:34:29.913
This is not an insult.
I'm amazed you can...

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:32.207
I just thought it was great.

01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:34.417
- Really?
- Yes, I was...

01:34:34.585 --> 01:34:37.629
What made you think
of that climax scene,

01:34:37.797 --> 01:34:41.675
where the architect is
with his actress girlfriend

01:34:41.842 --> 01:34:45.428
and the schizophrenic ex-wife
stabs him to death?

01:34:45.596 --> 01:34:49.432
- It just came to me one day.
- Well, it was fabulous.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.434
You really think I can write?

01:34:51.602 --> 01:34:54.938
There's maybe one or two things
I'd do differently,

01:34:55.106 --> 01:34:58.942
but who cares? It was fabulous.

01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:01.277
I mean it. I'm so impressed.

01:35:01.445 --> 01:35:03.446
I am. You made my day.

01:35:03.948 --> 01:35:04.989
It was great.

01:35:05.157 --> 01:35:07.450
I was set to be bored stiff.

01:35:07.618 --> 01:35:09.786
Would you like to have lunch?

01:35:09.954 --> 01:35:12.497
I'd love to talk about that script.

01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:14.874
We could do something with it.

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:19.129
And I'd like to hear what made
you suddenly drop out of life.

01:35:19.296 --> 01:35:21.673
- Who cares?
- No. I care.

01:35:21.841 --> 01:35:24.467
You used to be so ambitious, and...

01:35:24.635 --> 01:35:27.178
God, you really liked it?

01:35:49.326 --> 01:35:52.162
Gosh, you really went
through a crisis.

01:35:52.329 --> 01:35:53.997
How did you get over it?

01:35:54.165 --> 01:35:57.500
When I ran into you,
you seemed perfectly fine.

01:35:57.668 --> 01:35:59.502
You seem fine now.

01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:01.004
Well, I'll tell you.

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:04.799
One day, a month ago,
I really hit bottom.

01:36:04.967 --> 01:36:07.343
<i>I just felt</i>
<i>that in a godless universe,</i>

01:36:07.511 --> 01:36:09.512
<i>I didn't want to go on living.</i>

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:13.641
<i>I happen to own this rifle,</i>
<i>which I loaded, believe it or not,</i>

01:36:13.809 --> 01:36:15.268
<i>and pressed it to my forehead.</i>

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:17.479
<i>I thought, "I'm gonna kill myself."</i>

01:36:17.646 --> 01:36:20.356
<i>Then I thought,</i>
<i>"What if I'm wrong?</i>

01:36:20.524 --> 01:36:23.860
<i>What if there is a God?</i>
<i>Nobody really knows."</i>

01:36:24.028 --> 01:36:27.530
<i>Then I thought,</i>
<i>"No. Maybe is not good enough.</i>

01:36:27.698 --> 01:36:29.949
<i>- I want certainty or nothing."</i>

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:33.244
<i>I remember clearly,</i>
<i>the clock was ticking,</i>

01:36:33.412 --> 01:36:36.664
<i>and I was sitting there frozen,</i>

01:36:36.832 --> 01:36:38.708
<i>debating whether to shoot.</i>

01:36:41.253 --> 01:36:42.921
<i>All of a sudden, the gun went off.</i>

01:36:43.088 --> 01:36:46.800
<i>I was so tense, I inadvertently</i>
<i>squeezed the trigger.</i>

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:48.802
<i>But I was perspiring so much,</i>

01:36:48.969 --> 01:36:51.429
<i>the gun slid off my forehead</i>
<i>and missed me.</i>

01:36:52.723 --> 01:36:55.517
<i>Suddenly, neighbors</i>
<i>were pounding on the door</i>

01:36:55.684 --> 01:36:59.229
<i>and the whole scene</i>
<i>was just pandemonium.</i>

01:36:59.396 --> 01:37:00.939
<i>I ran to the door.</i>

01:37:01.106 --> 01:37:04.984
<i>I didn't know what to say.</i>
<i>I was embarrassed and confused.</i>

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:07.695
<i>My mind was racing a mile a minute.</i>

01:37:07.863 --> 01:37:11.866
<i>I just knew one thing...</i>
<i>I had to get out of that house.</i>

01:37:12.034 --> 01:37:15.745
<i>I had to get out</i>
<i>in the fresh air and clear my head.</i>

01:37:15.913 --> 01:37:18.748
<i>And I remember,</i>
<i>I walked the streets.</i>

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:22.085
<i>I didn't know what</i>
<i>was going through my mind.</i>

01:37:22.253 --> 01:37:25.964
<i>It all seemed so violent</i>
<i>and unreal to me.</i>

01:37:26.131 --> 01:37:28.925
<i>I wandered on the Upper West Side.</i>

01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:30.760
<i>It must have been hours.</i>

01:37:30.928 --> 01:37:34.222
<i>My feet hurt,</i>
<i>my head was pounding.</i>

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:37.767
<i>I went into a movie.</i>
<i>Didn't know what was playing.</i>

01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:42.146
<i>I just needed a moment to gather</i>
<i>my thoughts and be logical</i>

01:37:42.314 --> 01:37:45.859
<i>and put the world back</i>
<i>into rational perspective.</i>

01:37:54.577 --> 01:37:56.619
<i>I went up to the balcony,</i>

01:37:56.787 --> 01:37:58.329
<i>and I sat down.</i>

01:37:58.497 --> 01:38:02.125
<i>The movie was one I'd seen</i>
<i>many times in my life</i>

01:38:02.293 --> 01:38:05.628
<i>since I was a kid,</i>
<i>and I always loved it.</i>

01:38:05.796 --> 01:38:08.256
<i>I'm watching the screen,</i>

01:38:08.424 --> 01:38:11.551
<i>and I started getting</i>
<i>hooked on the film.</i>

01:38:13.846 --> 01:38:16.806
<i>"How can you think</i>
<i>of killing yourself?</i>

01:38:16.974 --> 01:38:18.224
<i>Isn't it stupid?</i>

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:20.810
<i>Look at all the people on the screen.</i>

01:38:20.978 --> 01:38:24.314
<i>They're funny, and what if</i>
<i>the worst is true?</i>

01:38:24.481 --> 01:38:28.109
<i>There's no God, you only</i>
<i>go around once, that's it.</i>

01:38:28.277 --> 01:38:31.905
<i>Don't you want to be</i>
<i>part of the experience?</i>

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:33.740
<i>It's not all a drag."</i>

01:38:33.908 --> 01:38:37.744
<i>And I'm thinking,</i>
<i>"I should stop ruining my life</i>

01:38:37.912 --> 01:38:40.204
<i>searching for answers</i>

01:38:40.372 --> 01:38:43.333
<i>and just enjoy it while it lasts."</i>

01:38:43.959 --> 01:38:45.501
<i>And after, who knows?</i>

01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:47.629
<i>Maybe there is something.</i>

01:38:47.796 --> 01:38:51.716
<i>I know "maybe" is a slim reed</i>
<i>to hang your life on,</i>

01:38:51.884 --> 01:38:53.927
<i>but that's the best we have.</i>

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:56.596
<i>And then I started to sit back</i>

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:59.682
<i>and I actually began</i>
<i>to enjoy myself.</i>

01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:03.227
<i>♪ Hail, Freedonia</i>
<i>Now don't you cry for me</i>

01:39:03.395 --> 01:39:05.438
<i>♪ 'Cause I'm coming</i>
<i>around the mountain...</i>

01:39:07.858 --> 01:39:11.194
There's something
that's been bothering me,

01:39:11.362 --> 01:39:14.197
and I thought I'd tell you
what it was

01:39:14.365 --> 01:39:16.991
and clear the deck,
and that's this...

01:39:17.159 --> 01:39:21.871
I've always regretted the way
I behaved that evening we went out.

01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:25.083
I really made a fool out of myself.

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:27.710
No, don't be ridiculous. I was...

01:39:27.878 --> 01:39:29.879
You know, it was my fault.

01:39:30.881 --> 01:39:34.050
So you want to go out
to dinner again?

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:36.719
- You have any interest?
- Sure.

01:39:36.887 --> 01:39:40.139
- Are you free this evening?
- Yeah.

01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:51.317
- I want ice. Who's got some...
- It's on the table, Dad.

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:52.986
Where's Holly? She's late.

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:56.489
Did you read the last thing
Holly wrote? It's great.

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:58.700
She writes
good dialogue.

01:39:58.867 --> 01:40:01.411
Can I say that you're
playing Desdemona?

01:40:01.578 --> 01:40:04.956
- Mom, it's only television.
- It's public television.

01:40:05.124 --> 01:40:08.084
Shakespeare doesn't get
better than <i>Othello</i>.

01:40:08.293 --> 01:40:11.129
You with some big black stud.
I love it.

01:40:11.296 --> 01:40:12.714
Oh, honey!

01:40:38.615 --> 01:40:41.492
<i>Oh, Lee, you are something.</i>

01:40:42.578 --> 01:40:44.454
<i>You look very beautiful.</i>

01:40:45.456 --> 01:40:47.373
<i>Marriage agrees with you.</i>

01:40:48.959 --> 01:40:51.210
<i>Everything that happened between us</i>

01:40:51.378 --> 01:40:54.380
<i>seems more and more hazy.</i>

01:40:55.257 --> 01:40:57.425
<i>I acted like such a fool.</i>

01:40:57.593 --> 01:40:59.886
<i>I don't know what came over me.</i>

01:41:00.054 --> 01:41:04.057
<i>The complete conviction</i>
<i>that I couldn't live without you.</i>

01:41:04.683 --> 01:41:07.060
<i>What I put us both through.</i>

01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:10.146
<i>And Hannah, who, as you once said,</i>

01:41:10.314 --> 01:41:13.149
<i>I loved much more than I realized.</i>

01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:20.531
Happy Thanksgiving!

01:41:21.867 --> 01:41:24.911
Daisy. I didn't miss dinner, did I?

01:41:25.079 --> 01:41:27.497
Hi, Marge. Happy Thanksgiving.

01:41:27.664 --> 01:41:29.457
- Hello.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

01:41:29.625 --> 01:41:30.833
Thank you.

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:34.730
Looks beautiful.

01:42:38.068 --> 01:42:40.361
It's just your husband.

01:42:40.529 --> 01:42:44.949
- Hi. When did you get here?
- Just a few minutes ago.

01:42:45.117 --> 01:42:47.326
- You look so beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:42:47.494 --> 01:42:51.080
I was telling your father
that it's ironic

01:42:51.248 --> 01:42:54.584
I used to always have
Thanksgiving with Hannah

01:42:54.751 --> 01:42:58.129
and I never thought
I could love anybody else.

01:42:58.297 --> 01:43:00.006
Here it is years later.

01:43:00.174 --> 01:43:03.885
I'm married to you and
completely in love with you.

01:43:04.052 --> 01:43:07.597
The heart is a very,
very resilient little muscle.

01:43:07.764 --> 01:43:10.016
It really is.

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:13.728
Guy marries one sister.

01:43:13.896 --> 01:43:15.146
Doesn't work out.

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:19.650
Then years later, he winds up
married to the other sister.

01:43:19.818 --> 01:43:22.778
How are you gonna top that?

01:43:24.531 --> 01:43:26.991
- Mickey?
- What?

01:43:28.118 --> 01:43:29.535
I'm pregnant.
