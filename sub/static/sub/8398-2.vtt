WEBVTT

00:04.360 --> 00:06.759
I've seen something like this before.
The masks, the wigs...

00:06.840 --> 00:08.359
I think he's trying
to recreate something.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.239
Do you remember the Shoreditch Creeper?

00:10.360 --> 00:12.399
A DCI Ronnie Holland
was the lead detective

00:12.480 --> 00:13.519
on the Creeper murders.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.519
Found him dead in his hallway.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.519
I'll call you.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.839
I've been ordered to move you
to another case.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.639
- Jared Cass, cyber-activist.
- It was defaced.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.279
- Did you know who was doing it?
- No.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.319
How's life in the Judas division, ma'am?

00:27.400 --> 00:30.559
I want to know exactly
how he handles that investigation.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.119
If he breaks the law...

00:33.200 --> 00:34.199
Are you saying you'd fit me up?

00:34.320 --> 00:35.439
...I want his head on a stick.

Just stayed up all night talking.

02:29.880 --> 02:33.039
I mainly stay up all night shouting.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.919
I find that hard to believe.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.359
No, it's true. Honestly.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.159
You're such a gentle man.

02:43.720 --> 02:44.719
Uh...

02:46.480 --> 02:48.679
I don't know about that.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.239
Coffee?

03:04.480 --> 03:07.239
Ah, Jesus.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.239
Stop!

03:28.640 --> 03:31.239
- What's on the trolley?
- Stuff for the incinerator.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.679
- Where'd it come from?
- Where do you think?

03:39.160 --> 03:41.279
Get this to Forensics double-quick.
They're waiting.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.359
Yes, sir.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.319
So, how are you doing?

03:50.360 --> 03:53.479
I'm all right. I'm good.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.559
You look a little tired.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.359
Yeah, I haven't exactly slept.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.879
Listen, er...

04:02.480 --> 04:04.399
I just want to make things right.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.719
That's all.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.839
Be careful, Justin.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.719
DS Ripley.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.039
Sir.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.799
Where's Luther?

04:42.560 --> 04:45.999
He's not at home. I sent a car.
And he's not answering his mobile.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.719
I don't know where he is, sir.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.639
This is me.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.279
- Blimey.
- I know.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.159
That's what happens
when I turn my phone on.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.479
- Victim's name is...
- Dani Lane.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.399
Husband's Craig.

05:53.160 --> 05:57.559
I was trying to call them
when you walked in and made your scene.

05:57.920 --> 06:01.199
Obviously you and I have got a problem,
so why don't you just leave this to me?

06:01.440 --> 06:03.319
Are you kicking me off?

06:05.920 --> 06:08.319
Go nail Ken Barnaby.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.959
Justin, if Ken Barnaby
murdered Jared Cass,

06:13.040 --> 06:14.639
he should go down for it.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.919
I can't imagine why you'd think
I'd have an issue with that.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.759
You found the bodies?

07:58.680 --> 08:01.999
What do I need to know
about you and DS Ripley?

08:02.080 --> 08:04.479
All it is

08:04.560 --> 08:07.359
is Justin and Erin Gray
have been seeing each other.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.359
- Seeing? As in...
- Apparently.

08:11.480 --> 08:15.399
It's a well-known fact
that she's not my biggest fan.

08:15.880 --> 08:20.639
So I think, you know, she's been, um,
filling his head with ideas.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.079
And that's all this is?

08:23.880 --> 08:27.799
- What else could it be?
- This is my house

08:27.880 --> 08:32.198
and I don't want Justin outside,
pissing in.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.239
Now, everything else gets put aside,

08:35.320 --> 08:38.198
including any grubby little
fratricidal conflict

08:38.280 --> 08:40.919
between you and DS Ripley. Clear?

08:41.799 --> 08:44.078
- Yes, boss.
- Good.

08:52.520 --> 08:57.359
You and I have to have
a very serious, grown-up chat.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.959
Think I'd be too scared to show?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.959
Are you coming for me?

09:12.200 --> 09:14.559
- With relish, yeah.
- Good.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.279
Can't be that much of a surprise.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.639
- So what do you want?
- I want you to leave Justin out of it.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.799
- I'm not sure I know what you mean.
- He's a good man, Erin.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.959
He's a good man and he's
got a good heart. Don't break it.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.799
Not as a way of getting towards me.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.839
He deserves better than that.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.559
Unbelievable, seriously.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.559
- I am. I'm speechless.
- How serious is it?

09:39.640 --> 09:41.839
Do you think I'd ever tell you
in a million years?

09:42.480 --> 09:43.839
Right.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.199
The thing about love
is that it brings out the best in you

09:47.280 --> 09:50.159
but it can also bring out the worst.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.519
All your fears, rage, self-doubt.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.559
Don't mess around with it.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.359
It'll blow up in your face.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.239
- Are you done?
- No.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.919
I'm having fun, though.

10:11.800 --> 10:12.879
You?

10:14.560 --> 10:17.279
No. I'm not done.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.719
Morning, Paul. You're early.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.639
I'm a little bit worried
about Lee Harvey.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.559
He's not happy, is he?
He didn't have dinner last night.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.199
We'll see if we can get the doctor
in to see him tonight?

11:22.240 --> 11:24.879
I'll pop in and see him.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.839
- Mr Carney... Can you watch reception?
- Yeah.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.319
Come on, Paul.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.719
Good morning, Jodie, love.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.319
So we know Ronnie Holland was killed
because he could connect

12:32.480 --> 12:35.679
the Shoreditch Creeper murders
to the death of Emily Hammond,

12:35.760 --> 12:37.759
Dani Lane and Craig Lane.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.679
Yes, but he was bludgeoned to death
in his own home,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.679
so if he knew the killer
for what he was...

12:42.760 --> 12:44.039
Why'd he open the door?

12:44.600 --> 12:47.919
If we knew that,
we'd be laughing, wouldn't we?

12:48.400 --> 12:52.279
We know Ronnie Holland
was fixated with the Creeper murders.

12:52.840 --> 12:56.079
Yeah, well, you don't think he didn't
keep tabs on his prime suspect.

12:56.160 --> 12:59.999
Benny, I need you to trawl through
his browser history, all right?

13:00.080 --> 13:01.639
Phone records. Whatever.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.239
- What am I looking for, exactly?
- Well, you ever get that feeling when

13:04.320 --> 13:06.839
you know something's not quite right
but you're not sure what it is?

13:06.920 --> 13:09.199
Look for that.
Call me when you've got something.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.119
Okay.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.119
Mr Barnaby? DS Ripley.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.799
Yeah. I remember.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.719
Mrs Barnaby, I'm sorry, I wonder
if I might have a word?

13:25.840 --> 13:26.839
Okay.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.879
So, what can I help you with?

13:41.480 --> 13:45.399
- Do you mind if I ask how it happened?
- How does anything happen?

13:45.800 --> 13:48.479
You dredged it all up.
My mind was all over the place.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.599
I was at sixes and sevens.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.919
Did they tell you what happens
to the hand after they...

13:56.000 --> 13:57.359
Cut it off?

13:59.480 --> 14:01.919
Burn it, presumably.

14:02.720 --> 14:03.919
They do.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.279
Except I got to it first.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.759
I know this must
be difficult to hear...

14:11.920 --> 14:14.119
but, currently,
your hand is in our forensics lab.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.479
So, Mr Barnaby,

14:18.560 --> 14:21.919
if there's anything you need to tell me,
then now would be a good time.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.119
Why would I have anything to tell you?

14:26.960 --> 14:28.399
I know you're scared.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.599
My wife has MS.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.359
If she loses me, she's lost everything.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.439
She dies alone.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.799
So "scared" doesn't come into it.
Do you understand that?

14:41.880 --> 14:43.159
I really am very sorry.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.559
Yeah, well, you carry on being sorry,
DS Ripley,

14:49.640 --> 14:54.639
and if you and your ghouls
find anything, come and see me again.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.879
Till then, why don't you piss off
and leave me alone?

15:06.120 --> 15:08.199
Sorry, just a thought.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.919
My colleague, DCI Luther...

15:12.120 --> 15:13.319
What about him?

15:17.120 --> 15:20.159
- Did he say anything to you?
- Anything about what?

15:20.840 --> 15:22.479
Did he...

15:23.320 --> 15:24.799
suggest anything?

15:25.240 --> 15:28.639
What suggest...
What are you talking about?

15:30.840 --> 15:31.919
Nothing.

15:33.680 --> 15:34.959
Thanks for your time.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.679
I trawled
Ronnie Holland's phone records.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.759
Checked, double-checked,
cross-referenced.

15:59.840 --> 16:03.079
Gave myself a migraine. He called
his daughter in Canada once a week,

16:03.480 --> 16:05.079
the odd call to a few friends.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.079
Then another number which stuck out.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.319
What made you think that?

16:08.400 --> 16:09.839
The time of the calls.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.519
They were made after midnight.
And he does this four or five times

16:13.600 --> 16:15.959
- over a six-month period.
- So who's he calling?

16:16.040 --> 16:17.639
Winchford Care Home.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.599
- Ex-wife? Family?
- After midnight? Nah.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.559
- So I checked to see who lived there.
- And?

16:23.840 --> 16:26.359
- William Carney.
- Was he in the cold cases?

16:26.880 --> 16:28.919
Isn't he just!

16:29.000 --> 16:32.319
William Carney. Born Billericay, 1948.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.959
Two hundred miles away

16:34.040 --> 16:37.439
and two years after the last Creeper
murder, Carney was convicted

16:37.520 --> 16:40.159
of choking Sandra Cho to death.

16:40.280 --> 16:43.079
- She was a working girl in Liverpool.
- Did he serve his full time?

16:43.160 --> 16:44.719
Twenty-five years, every day of it.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.919
Man's a born predator
and Ronnie Holland knew it.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.119
Did you get hard?

16:54.200 --> 16:56.679
She was a bit nice, wasn't she?

16:58.160 --> 17:00.039
Good legs.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.039
Looking for one of your residents.
William Carney.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.919
- He's a popular lad this morning.
- Is he?

18:14.480 --> 18:16.879
"Paul Ellis". Who's that? Family?

18:16.960 --> 18:19.319
I don't think so. But I don't know.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.599
- When did he leave?
- You just missed him.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.719
- Just now?
- Yeah.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.959
Benny, listen.
I need you to check out a white male.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.039
He's about 40 years old.
His name's Paul Ellis.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.359
William Carney?

20:26.720 --> 20:29.319
I'm DCI John Luther.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.439
Ronnie Holland sends his regards.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.039
Does he?

20:38.480 --> 20:39.959
What, from the land beyond?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.519
Why would you say that, sir?

20:42.680 --> 20:44.679
Well, he's stopped calling.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.119
He used to like to call me, you know,

20:48.480 --> 20:50.159
when he'd had a few.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.319
He was a devil for it.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.599
You mind if I take a look at that phone?

21:00.840 --> 21:02.919
I mean, if you like,
I could sit here and wait

21:03.000 --> 21:06.039
for the warrant to be signed...

21:11.480 --> 21:13.879
Her feet look lovely
in that one, don't they?

21:15.880 --> 21:17.919
Do you see the arch of the instep?

21:18.840 --> 21:23.839
That happens when they die, you see.
It... It sort of bunches up, yes?

21:28.800 --> 21:31.479
Paul Ellis. Who is he?

21:34.200 --> 21:36.519
Well, he's a fan, apparently.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.839
Guv, I'm not comfortable with this.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.919
Erin, you started this.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.879
You got this ball rolling.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.439
So now we have to control
the direction of its travel.

22:57.840 --> 23:01.119
"The first principle
is that you must not fool yourself

23:02.160 --> 23:04.879
"and you are the easiest person to fool.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.439
"Richard Feynman.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.359
"Meep, meep."

23:10.200 --> 23:13.839
- We should really get a shift on.
- In a minute.

23:13.920 --> 23:17.999
I just want to get a feel of the guy.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.039
He underlines.

23:24.280 --> 23:26.559
- So?
- We tend to underline observations

23:26.640 --> 23:30.279
that confirm our view of the world.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.959
Give me a day with those books

23:36.040 --> 23:38.759
and I'll serve him to you on a plate.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.079
Give me a search warrant
and you can have it.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.999
But where would be the fun in that?

23:47.120 --> 23:50.439
Look at this.
What does this say about a man?

23:50.840 --> 23:51.839
You know what?

23:53.240 --> 23:55.319
I love this guy to bits.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.199
Hello, it's Mary.
Leave a message.

24:06.160 --> 24:10.759
Er, hello, Mary. It's DCI John Luther,

24:10.840 --> 24:12.839
from last night.

24:13.760 --> 24:17.239
Um, yeah, I, you know,
I just called to say hi and, um...

24:17.360 --> 24:20.479
Yeah. Cheers, then. Bye.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.999
These are cold case files

24:32.080 --> 24:37.439
pertaining to the Shoreditch Creeper
murders, circa 1979 to1983.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.319
Unsolved killings,

24:39.400 --> 24:43.039
which we believe were committed
by William Carney.

24:43.480 --> 24:47.079
We believe that these crimes
were connected to the subsequent murders

24:47.160 --> 24:50.319
of Dani Lane, Craig Lane, Emily Hammond

24:50.400 --> 24:54.319
and one of our own, DCI Ronnie Holland.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.759
The connection goes by the name
of Paul Ellis.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.039
Now, somewhere in these files,
there's a link to him,

24:59.120 --> 25:00.919
direct or otherwise.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.799
This thing with feet...

25:06.840 --> 25:08.079
What's that about?

25:11.520 --> 25:13.879
When I was a little boy,

25:14.720 --> 25:18.839
I read a magazine article
about foot-binding in China.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.439
Do you know how it was done?

25:25.120 --> 25:30.039
They swathe a young woman's feet
in strips of cloth,

25:31.200 --> 25:33.439
bending the toes under the foot,

25:34.360 --> 25:36.079
breaking the bones.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.879
The way the women were forced to walk
resulted in...

25:41.960 --> 25:45.599
hypertrophy of the hip muscles
and the perineum.

25:46.720 --> 25:49.279
It gave them very muscular vaginas.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.559
Not very shy to talk about it,
are you?

25:58.640 --> 26:00.839
Why should I be?

26:01.440 --> 26:02.679
Well, there's this.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.799
At the time of the murders,
you were a dustman.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.359
They were on your route.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.719
But you changed your pattern
once Ronnie had sniffed you out.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.919
- Yes, he did, didn't he?
- No more breaking into houses.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.479
No more middle-class women.
It was all working girls from there on.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.719
Well, if you can't get steak,
you have to settle for hamburger.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.799
Never quite
as satisfying, though.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.279
Nice, tender cuts of meat.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.639
How did you and Paul Ellis meet?
I mean, how'd you get together?

26:42.080 --> 26:45.519
- Well, you tell me.
- Huh. Well...

26:46.840 --> 26:49.799
How about this?
You spent 25 years in prison,

26:49.880 --> 26:52.679
wanking into a dirty little sock,
thinking about the day you get out

26:52.760 --> 26:55.519
and what you're gonna do
to the little girls that got away.

26:55.960 --> 26:58.359
Dani and Emily from Crosswood Street.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.639
But when the time
actually comes to it, well...

27:02.680 --> 27:05.639
Look at you.
So, you look for someone else.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.519
I think, you know,
you get on the internet,

27:08.600 --> 27:10.479
S&M sites.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.679
Someone that wants to do
what you used to do.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.679
Someone who was younger,
I don't know, fitter, stronger.

27:16.800 --> 27:21.279
- Am I making you laugh? What's going on?
- You really have no idea at all, do you?

27:21.360 --> 27:22.799
Well, then tell me.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.439
I didn't seek him out.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.599
He came to me.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.679
The boy is a pilgrim.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.159
- Sorry.
- What is it?

27:38.240 --> 27:40.559
- You want to see this.
- What?

27:42.200 --> 27:44.559
What am I looking for?

27:44.640 --> 27:46.199
Paul Ellis.

28:12.160 --> 28:16.439
In 1984 you were convicted
of the murder of Sandra Cho.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.519
But before that...

28:22.680 --> 28:25.279
Ronnie Holland liked you
for another murder.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.319
The murder of April Saunders.

28:28.720 --> 28:32.879
April was a prostitute
working out of a council flat in Camden.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.199
The killer strangled her with stockings,

28:36.280 --> 28:39.279
bit her feet and stole her shoes.

28:41.280 --> 28:46.679
April was arrested several times
and she used aliases.

28:48.680 --> 28:53.839
April Edwards and April Simmons
in 1980.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.119
But she was arrested twice

28:57.200 --> 29:00.959
and used the alias of April Ellis.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.399
Turns out Ellis was her maiden name.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.199
Ellis, Saunders,

29:07.280 --> 29:10.759
whatever we want to call her,
April had a son,

29:10.840 --> 29:12.719
aged 12, Paul.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.639
And he was hiding in the wardrobe
when his mother was murdered.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.399
He saw the whole thing.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.199
Can you imagine that?

29:23.640 --> 29:28.239
What that would do
to the mind of a young boy?

29:29.720 --> 29:31.839
Watching you murder his mother?

29:49.600 --> 29:52.079
We're on our way to his house now.

31:31.280 --> 31:34.479
What do you want?
I'm not your performing seal. I'm busy.

31:34.920 --> 31:37.039
Luther paid a visit to her.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.519
Apparently, he's worried
I might break your heart.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.239
What did he say?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.159
- What did he say?
- He knows something's wrong.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.559
He's just still trying to work out what.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.279
Oh. Holy crap, though.

31:50.360 --> 31:51.919
How did you get on with Barnaby?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.919
I spoke to him
and he looked at me like I was mad.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.559
- That hardly matters now.
- No?

31:57.640 --> 31:58.679
No.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.319
Luther's sniffing around,
so we need to move quickly.

32:01.880 --> 32:02.999
Meaning what, exactly?

32:03.080 --> 32:05.919
You've got to make a full statement,
on the record, today.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.399
Catalogue everything Luther ever did.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.919
Every lie he told, every law he broke,
everything.

32:14.440 --> 32:15.719
All right, then I need a deal.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.479
- That can't happen, Justin.
- No, it has to.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.399
I'm not losing me job for anyone.
Not him, not you.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.799
I want proper assurances
and that means legal assurances,

32:24.120 --> 32:25.639
or the deal's off.

32:33.400 --> 32:37.279
- Yes, yes. John, this is...
- Joy Harris. Divisional surgeon.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.079
- You understand this is a very sick man?
- Sicker than you know.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.079
Which means he's under my duty of care.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.879
He's fine.
He's had his meds. He's got oxygen.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.799
But the stress of arrest
and interrogation...

32:45.920 --> 32:48.319
Are you joking? You're going to use this
to shut me down?

32:48.400 --> 32:50.039
The minute he becomes symptomatic,

32:50.120 --> 32:51.559
I'm pulling him out of
the interrogation.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.359
How long have I got?

32:59.400 --> 33:01.359
I got the remains of the hand
to Forensics.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.399
They reconstructed Barnaby's finger
well enough to get a match.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.519
So nick him, then.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.039
How'd you do it?

34:55.280 --> 34:58.879
Come on. This little boy here, I mean,
he should really hate you, shouldn't he?

34:58.960 --> 35:01.279
- I mean, you killed his mother.
- You think she was a good mother?

35:01.360 --> 35:04.599
- Oh, I think she did her best.
- She was a deranged slut.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.519
Do you know why Paul
was in that wardrobe?

35:07.600 --> 35:10.079
Because it wasn't voluntarily,
I can tell you that.

35:13.080 --> 35:15.919
He spent a lot of time in that cupboard.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.879
Heard and saw more
than any young boy should.

35:19.120 --> 35:21.999
Didn't take long
before he started creeping about,

35:22.080 --> 35:25.199
breaking in, stealing shoes, underwear.

35:25.560 --> 35:30.039
Peeping into bathrooms. And so
he did what any monster would do.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.879
And what is that, hmm?

35:33.040 --> 35:35.479
Find his creator?

35:35.560 --> 35:39.359
Well, his first stop
was dear old Ronnie Holland.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.519
Of course, Ronnie remembers

35:42.600 --> 35:45.359
the broken little boy
with the dead mummy.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.879
So he takes pity on him.

35:51.400 --> 35:55.119
He says "I know who did this to you.
I know who did this, son."

35:56.880 --> 36:02.079
So Paul turns up on my doorstep
so full of rage he can hardly speak.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.919
Don't try it.
Don't you keep trying that.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.799
Don't you keep sucking on that thing.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.319
- I didn't make him what he is.
- You're playing with me.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.039
- That was his mother.
- Don't play with me.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.559
"Your mother did it, Paul,
your mother did it."

36:17.640 --> 36:19.839
All I did was shape the clay.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.039
I'll turn that oxygen machine off,
I tell you now.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.679
All I did was give him
a sense of purpose.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.479
Oh, yeah? And how?

36:26.560 --> 36:28.919
How did you give him that, hmm?

36:30.040 --> 36:33.639
I explained how much fun it was,
you see,

36:33.720 --> 36:35.719
killing his mother.

36:42.040 --> 36:43.719
How do you pick your next victims?

36:43.800 --> 36:45.399
- Tell me how you do that.
- I like to think of it

36:45.560 --> 36:48.119
as one for the road...

36:48.280 --> 36:50.999
He's using his oxygen mask
far too often.

36:51.080 --> 36:52.479
He's under too much stress.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.519
- Who is she?
- She's lovely.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.439
I can't wait for you to meet her.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.479
Who is she?! Who?!

36:59.560 --> 37:03.159
- This interview is over!
- Who is she? Where is she?

37:03.440 --> 37:06.679
She should be at home
round about now, I imagine.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.439
- Who is she? Who?
- Step out, please.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.719
I know you like to win and you're going
to have your win but who is she?

37:11.800 --> 37:13.639
- Feet like a princess.
- Who, actually, who?

37:13.720 --> 37:16.039
- Tell me who she is!
- John...

37:29.040 --> 37:30.199
Eve?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.399
Hello!

37:56.200 --> 38:00.279
Hi, babe. Yeah, I'm home already.

38:00.480 --> 38:03.079
Oh, brilliant. Er, spag bol.

38:03.160 --> 38:06.519
Yeah. Did you speak to Ayesha?
Did she tell you what happened?

38:06.600 --> 38:08.319
I know! Okay.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.079
All right, see you in a minute. Bye.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.759
Jodie? Babes?

39:07.120 --> 39:10.719
So I spoke to Ayesha... Jo?

39:11.640 --> 39:14.599
Huh? I'm in the shower!

39:14.680 --> 39:17.479
- Do you need a wee?
- No.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.879
No, I'm all right.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.559
- Hey.
- Hello, babe.

39:55.680 --> 39:58.719
- Oh, God, I'm so tired.
- I know. What a day.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.959
Hey, I got loads of food
and, um, and some wine. So...

40:02.040 --> 40:05.239
- Great. I'll start chopping the onions.
- Yeah. I'll be down in a sec.

40:31.480 --> 40:35.159
Benny?
Get me the Winchford Nursing Home

40:35.240 --> 40:37.559
personnel office. Now.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.679
Couldn't stand it, could you?

40:39.760 --> 40:42.159
You couldn't stand it,
all these pretty nurses

40:42.240 --> 40:43.919
thinking you were some weak man.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.159
But you're gonna show 'em
who you really are, hmm?

40:47.080 --> 40:50.519
Nicely done.
But you may be a little late.

40:51.400 --> 40:55.799
Get him outside. Get him out of here.
Get him out of here! Now!

40:55.920 --> 40:58.079
- What, and you didn't even know?
- Not even.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.559
- Ugh.
- Well, that's the thing.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.639
You see quite a lot of dirty old men
and whatever.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.799
You catch them glancing
at your boobs and stuff.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.479
- Ugh.
- No!

41:05.760 --> 41:09.999
With this bloke, it's like
he was looking through your skin.

41:10.360 --> 41:13.399
Mmm. I'm just popping to the loo.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.599
Jode?

42:02.080 --> 42:05.519
- So what time's Ayesha home, then?
- Half an hour ago.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.119
Do you think she's stopped off
to see what's-his-name?

42:08.200 --> 42:10.119
- What, Steve?
- No, not Steve.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.439
No, the weird-looking one.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.399
- What weird-looking one?
- You know.

42:13.480 --> 42:16.999
The one that looks like...
Who is it? Paul Daniels.

42:17.080 --> 42:20.399
Jamal? Jamal does not look
like Paul Daniels.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.559
- Jamal's fit.
- Mmm.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.719
I don't know about "fit".
I wouldn't give him a "fit".

42:29.880 --> 42:31.519
Did you actually hear that?

42:31.880 --> 42:34.399
Ayesha? Are you home?

42:43.480 --> 42:47.559
- You can't be serious. What...
- Ayesha?

42:54.480 --> 42:56.919
- Ayesha?
- Babes, what are you doing?

42:57.000 --> 42:58.999
Well, it's not as if
there's actually anyone there.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.039
No. It's just a thing.

43:02.120 --> 43:04.119
- What?
- The house settling.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.159
Hello?

43:14.600 --> 43:16.359
Hello!

44:06.720 --> 44:10.079
So not funny.

44:10.280 --> 44:13.079
Evie! Stop it.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.759
Right, that's it. You're in big trouble.

44:32.320 --> 44:33.319
Hello?

44:33.480 --> 44:36.719
It's Paul, isn't it?
Oh, you don't have to do this!

44:37.720 --> 44:40.799
Please. We won't say anything.
We won't tell anybody...

44:49.280 --> 44:50.839
Hello?

44:53.880 --> 44:56.119
Anyone home?

46:30.840 --> 46:33.439
Hope you don't mind, Paul,
but I gave Ayesha a call.

46:33.520 --> 46:36.159
Asked if I could sneak up here with her.

46:36.760 --> 46:38.439
Hmm?

46:39.280 --> 46:42.559
Well, go on, say something.

47:05.720 --> 47:06.719
Argh!

47:09.960 --> 47:11.719
Hey. Stay down, now.

48:27.960 --> 48:29.359
All clear.

48:32.520 --> 48:34.039
Mr Carney!

48:36.160 --> 48:37.559
I've got a message for you.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.759
Dickhead.

48:55.720 --> 49:00.519
Ken Barnaby, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Jared Cass.

49:01.400 --> 49:04.959
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

49:05.040 --> 49:07.439
if you fail to mention, when questioned,

49:07.520 --> 49:10.999
something which you later rely on
in court.

49:23.080 --> 49:25.079
Hello, Ronnie.

49:32.520 --> 49:34.839
DCI Luther. Leave a message.

49:34.920 --> 49:37.679
Hi. It's me, Mary.

49:37.760 --> 49:40.799
It's Mary Day, from last night.

49:40.880 --> 49:44.639
So we seem to be
crossing messages. Um...

49:44.720 --> 49:48.639
Anyway, cool. Speak soon.

49:51.320 --> 49:53.359
Or not.

50:04.720 --> 50:05.719
So...

50:07.960 --> 50:09.199
You ready?

50:10.320 --> 50:12.479
Yeah. I'm ready.

50:14.960 --> 50:16.559
This is what you wanted.

50:25.600 --> 50:28.999
- You called him a dickhead?
- Well, that's what he is.

50:29.080 --> 50:31.399
Yeah, well,
you won't hear me denying it.

50:33.200 --> 50:35.959
Benny, that phone
I asked you to trace. Anything?

50:36.040 --> 50:38.879
Yeah, it's been on the move a lot,
but it's made three long stops

50:38.960 --> 50:41.639
- at Lasseter Avenue in Stepney.
- Oh, yeah?

50:42.080 --> 50:44.599
What do we know
about Lasseter Avenue in Stepney?

50:49.640 --> 50:55.599
You started working with DCI John Luther
in January 2009.

50:55.680 --> 50:58.479
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

50:58.560 --> 51:01.839
And what was the first investigation
you both worked on?

51:02.400 --> 51:07.679
A home invasion. Murder.
Suspect's name was Alice Morgan.

51:24.520 --> 51:26.079
I'll see to it.

51:35.080 --> 51:38.079
- What are you doing, John?
- It's DCI Luther, actually.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.599
All right, girls?

51:49.680 --> 51:53.199
Well, well, well.
This is where it all goes down.

51:53.280 --> 51:56.119
Secret Squirrel Central Station!

51:57.200 --> 51:58.279
Hello.

51:58.840 --> 52:00.559
Hello, John.

52:05.160 --> 52:06.759
Do yourself a favour, mate.

52:08.240 --> 52:10.679
- Get out of here.
- Or what?

52:11.280 --> 52:13.919
- John...
- Shut up, Mr Ripley.

52:14.600 --> 52:16.639
You might just spoil my good mood.

52:20.520 --> 52:24.399
So, has my operation got a secret name?
Like a codename or something?

52:24.480 --> 52:30.039
Mmm? No? That's not very covert, is it?

52:37.440 --> 52:40.679
Do you remember that show
This Is Your Life?

52:41.080 --> 52:43.079
It's like the big red book.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.879
Except for all these people are dead.

52:46.280 --> 52:47.799
Well, most of them.

52:47.880 --> 52:51.319
- Don't make it any worse for yourself.
- And who are you, exactly?

52:52.240 --> 52:54.279
Me?

52:54.720 --> 52:58.079
DSU George Stark.

53:01.920 --> 53:03.879
I tell you what, George.

53:03.960 --> 53:05.839
You're a big man.

53:07.760 --> 53:09.639
And I'm tired.

53:09.720 --> 53:12.039
But if we are gonna take lumps
out of each other,

53:12.120 --> 53:15.119
it won't be the first one
I've had tonight.

53:16.120 --> 53:18.079
And someone's gonna have to find out.

53:18.960 --> 53:22.119
Your boss. My boss.
And then they'll ask why,

53:22.480 --> 53:26.959
how I just walked in on your...
operation.

53:27.880 --> 53:33.199
And how I walked out of here with
all the evidence you've got against me.

53:37.280 --> 53:39.599
What's that gonna do
to your reputation, eh?

53:41.040 --> 53:44.079
Now, you can continue if you want.

53:44.880 --> 53:46.519
Chase me down.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.919
But if you take me down,

53:52.800 --> 53:56.239
I'll take you down even faster
and even harder.

55:05.760 --> 55:08.959
You started
working with DCI John Luther

55:09.040 --> 55:14.079
- in January 2009, is that correct?
- That's right.

55:14.160 --> 55:17.279
And what was the first
investigation you both worked on?

55:17.360 --> 55:21.679
A home invasion. Murder.
Suspect's name was Alice Morgan.

55:21.760 --> 55:23.439
She was the daughter of the victims.

55:23.520 --> 55:25.239
Do you want me to go through every case

55:25.320 --> 55:26.439
- we worked on?
- Course they do.

55:26.520 --> 55:28.919
If you would.
I know it will take a while but...

55:29.000 --> 55:32.999
Yeah. That's why I want
to get the big stuff on record,

55:33.080 --> 55:37.079
- while my mind's clear.
- Okay. That's why we're here.

55:37.160 --> 55:38.839
Right.

55:40.760 --> 55:42.919
I just want to say, for the record...

55:43.000 --> 55:45.679
- Yeah?
- ...that, in my experience,

55:45.960 --> 55:49.799
DCI Luther
is an outstanding police officer.

55:49.880 --> 55:52.279
I'm honoured to have worked at his side

55:52.360 --> 55:55.119
and I consider this investigation
to be little more

55:55.200 --> 55:57.599
than a fishing expedition
and a witch-hunt.

55:58.360 --> 56:01.679
While, arguably, I've seen him
cut procedural corners,

56:01.960 --> 56:05.799
DCI Luther has never, to my knowledge,
broken any laws,

56:05.880 --> 56:08.639
either in pursuit of his duty
or otherwise.

56:08.720 --> 56:11.439
I've been honoured to work with him.

56:24.800 --> 56:26.039
Justin.

56:47.400 --> 56:49.279
What time do you call this?

56:49.360 --> 56:52.039
- I'm sorry, did we, erm...
- No.

56:53.600 --> 56:57.719
I'm sorry. It was a joke.
Kind of a bad joke.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.279
It's just... I tried to call...

57:00.360 --> 57:03.359
You know, you tried to call,
then I tried to call and...

57:05.800 --> 57:09.719
Look, um... Okay, so last night,

57:11.720 --> 57:13.199
it was...

57:14.960 --> 57:19.119
I don't know what it was, um...
But it was, it was...

57:19.200 --> 57:22.919
- Yeah, it was...
- Yeah.

57:25.720 --> 57:27.999
And I don't want to play games.
You know, I'm too old for that.

57:28.080 --> 57:33.599
I'm not like, well, old old,
but I'm too old for that.

57:33.680 --> 57:36.679
- I'm not a game-player.
- Good.

57:36.960 --> 57:39.039
'Cause neither am I.

57:40.600 --> 57:41.799
Shall we just stop talking?

57:43.680 --> 57:44.999
Okay.

57:45.080 --> 57:47.159
