(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:33.767 --> 00:35.868
MIKE: Marquess, come in here!

00:35.870 --> 00:38.837
(HUMMING)

00:38.839 --> 00:40.439
What's going on?

00:40.441 --> 00:41.573
Have a seat.

00:45.945 --> 00:47.146
(GASPS)

00:47.148 --> 00:48.981
(WHISPERING)
I know what this is.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.349
This is an intervention.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.751
(GASPS) You all think
I drink too much.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.586
You know what? And maybe I do.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.489
Maybe I'm just a ghost
who lately feels like
he's lost his way.

00:57.491 --> 01:01.960
But my sobriety is my issue,
not yours.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.128
So drop it!

01:03.130 --> 01:04.797
-Marquess...
-No!

01:04.799 --> 01:07.666
No! It is my turn to talk now.

01:07.668 --> 01:12.538
You all have done enough
talking behind my back

01:12.540 --> 01:16.175
about what you perceive
to be my problem.

01:16.177 --> 01:19.078
This is about
the three bottles of wine in
the recycling bin, isn't it?

01:19.080 --> 01:22.448
Well, what you don't know
is that one of the bottles
was corked,

01:22.450 --> 01:24.416
I shared the other bottle
with our neighbor,

01:24.418 --> 01:26.552
who is going through
a difficult divorce.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.287
Which none of you know about,

01:28.289 --> 01:30.489
because none of you
have bothered to ask.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.291
And the third bottle, well...

01:32.293 --> 01:33.826
I shouldn't have to explain,

01:33.828 --> 01:38.697
because I am a grown-up,
who has had a shitty week.

01:39.165 --> 01:40.599
So (BLEEP) you.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.800
(BLEEP) you.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.235
And (BLEEP) you.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.471
And (BLEEP) this intervention.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.372
This isn't a intervention.

01:47.374 --> 01:48.807
We got a new mystery.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.008
We just reading it in here

01:50.010 --> 01:51.944
because it's
100 degrees outside.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.245
Oh.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.581
What's it say?

01:55.583 --> 01:57.850
It says you're a big
(BLEEP) alcoholic.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.685
Ha!

01:59.687 --> 02:00.853
No, it doesn't.

02:00.855 --> 02:03.722
It says,
"Dear Mike Tyson Mystery Team,

02:03.724 --> 02:07.192
"My name is Thomas Foley,
and I need your help."

02:08.294 --> 02:09.728
THOMAS: Thanks for coming.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.530
As I said in my message...
(SIGHS)

02:11.532 --> 02:14.533
...my wife, Diane, has been
in a coma for nearly a year.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.768
She slipped on some ice
in the driveway,

02:16.770 --> 02:18.237
and fell and hit her head.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.572
They thought she'd wake up
after a few days.

02:20.574 --> 02:21.773
But the day has
turned into weeks,

02:21.775 --> 02:24.176
and the weeks
turned to months.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.178
Her vitals are normal.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.814
The doctors say there's
no medical reason
for her to still be in a coma.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.516
I just...

02:30.518 --> 02:33.152
I can't bear the thought
of spending another
Christmas without her.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.353
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

02:34.355 --> 02:36.722
Ben, can you turn that off?

02:40.827 --> 02:42.694
This is my son, Ben.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.863
In his defense,
what 18-year old wants
to come home from college

02:44.865 --> 02:46.765
to spend the holidays
in the hospital?

02:46.767 --> 02:49.201
It must be hard for you
to see your mom like this.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.369
She's my step-mom.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.371
-Ben!
-What?

02:52.373 --> 02:53.906
It's been a hard year.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.542
Well, on the bright side,

02:56.544 --> 02:57.509
-I bet her (BLEEP)
has gotten real big, huh?
-YUNG: Ew.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.344
-(GASPS) Pigeon!
-What?

02:59.346 --> 03:02.314
It's a compliment.
I like a hairy (BLEEP).

03:02.715 --> 03:04.149
(SIGHS)

03:04.151 --> 03:06.218
You say, "Don't talk unless
I have something nice to say."

03:06.220 --> 03:09.821
Here I say something nice,
and you don't
like that either.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.523
Fine, I'll just sit here
and say nothing.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.392
(STAMMERING)
I'm not saying that.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.295
I'm saying, "Talk
if you have something relevant

03:16.297 --> 03:18.330
"to say about
this woman's condition."

03:18.332 --> 03:21.667
Okay, I think
they should pull the plug
and get on with their lives.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.101
-Oh, my God! Pigeon!
-(YUNG GROANS)

03:23.103 --> 03:24.636
What, "Oh, my God"?

03:24.638 --> 03:27.739
I cannot win with you people.
It's like a bad dream.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.208
(GASPS) That's it!

03:29.210 --> 03:31.376
Diane is in a dream!

03:31.378 --> 03:34.112
Well, not an actual dream,
but when you're in a coma
you're in a dream-like state.

03:34.114 --> 03:38.050
And as a ghost,
I have the ability to travel
to the dream realm.

03:38.052 --> 03:41.019
Ah! That's my purpose!

03:41.021 --> 03:42.554
I can find her
and talk to her,

03:42.556 --> 03:44.590
and maybe even bring her back.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.391
Oh! That would be incredible.

03:46.393 --> 03:49.027
Uh, tell me about it.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.829
I have just been
so blech lately.

03:50.831 --> 03:54.266
You know what I mean?
Just blech!

03:54.268 --> 03:56.201
I just feel like...
I don't know.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.570
I just feel like I look around
and everyone is doing
better than me.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.973
I'm sorry that my life is
harder than everyone else's.

04:00.975 --> 04:03.909
It just is.
It's like, "Why me?" you know?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.044
But now I am on a mission.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.112
(CHUCKLES)

04:07.114 --> 04:08.513
Marquess to the rescue!

04:08.515 --> 04:10.415
Who wants to celebrate, huh?
Come on!

04:10.417 --> 04:13.819
I want every single person
in this room
to get off their derrieres,

04:13.821 --> 04:15.587
and follow me
to the hospital cafeteria,

04:15.589 --> 04:19.424
because it is
Margarita Monday.
On a Tuesday!

04:20.860 --> 04:23.595
MIKE: So are we or
are we not pulling the plug?

04:24.430 --> 04:25.897
Well, that's a lamp, so...

04:29.202 --> 04:31.536
(SCOFFS) No alcohol.

04:31.538 --> 04:35.874
How are all these people
supposed to cope
when they have sick relatives?

04:35.876 --> 04:37.342
The chapel? Please.

04:37.710 --> 04:38.877
Pills.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.345
Take a couple of these.

04:40.347 --> 04:43.282
They do everything a margarita
does without the sugar, Fatty.

04:43.284 --> 04:47.152
So, Marquess, how do we get
to this dream realm place?

04:47.154 --> 04:49.821
Well, you can't go.
Only I can.

04:49.823 --> 04:50.956
But we're a team.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.225
Right, but I'm the only one
who's dead.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.626
No (BLEEP), Marquess.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.161
That's why we're all going
to kill ourselves.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.096
-What?
-What are you out
of your mind?

04:58.098 --> 05:00.832
It's the only way
that we can solve the mystery.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.534
Together, as a team.

05:02.536 --> 05:03.902
If I'm going to kill myself,

05:03.904 --> 05:05.971
it'll be because
of my massive depression,

05:05.973 --> 05:09.374
not to help some bitch
lying in a bed.

05:09.376 --> 05:12.911
And I don't care
how big her (BLEEP) is.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.380
Don't look at me!
I'm not gonna kill myself.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.649
Wow.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.452
I did not think you guys
were going to say that.

05:20.454 --> 05:23.055
Man, I mean,
I'm truly flabbergasted.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.991
Well, we're in quite
a conundrum, then.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.225
Why?

05:27.227 --> 05:28.794
Because I put poison
in our drinks.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.629
-(PIGEON SCREECHES)
-You poisoned us?

05:30.631 --> 05:32.964
It's called
physician-assisted suicide.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.232
You're not a physician.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.835
And it's not suicide,
you asshole, it's murder.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.437
Okay, okay! Fine.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.539
Gee, man, let me...

05:40.541 --> 05:43.375
Let me just find a nurse
or someone who can just
pump our stomachs before we...

05:54.654 --> 05:56.855
Well, welcome
to the afterlife.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.257
Just as (BLEEP)
as I told you it was.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.360
Oh, my (BLEEP) God!
You killed us!

06:01.362 --> 06:02.894
You (BLEEP) killed us.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.096
Okay, guys.

06:04.098 --> 06:06.365
First let me start off
by saying, I'm sorry.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.866
Seriously, I'm...

06:07.868 --> 06:09.301
I'm very sorry.

06:09.303 --> 06:12.104
And second,
look how white we are.

06:12.106 --> 06:14.206
Oh, (BLEEP)!
Now I got to sound white.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.875

Hey, guys, who wants to come
with me to the car wash?

06:16.877 --> 06:19.778
I have a Subaru
that I'm going to take it
to get it washed.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.180
I go to the car wash about
two times per week.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.383
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Oh, shit!
I sound so white!

06:24.385 --> 06:26.585
Guys! Guys!

06:26.587 --> 06:28.487
Dad, can you be serious
for a second?

06:28.489 --> 06:31.690
Oh, my God, Yung!
You sound so white, too.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.692
What happened to your accent?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.994
So, this is for eternity now?

06:35.996 --> 06:38.096
Did you hear
that thing on NPR?

06:38.098 --> 06:42.134
I was driving in my Subaru
and that's when
I was listening to NPR.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.102
(EKG BEEPING)

06:53.146 --> 06:55.347
So, what do we do
to get into her dream?

06:55.349 --> 06:56.982
We enter her.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.084
(HIGH-PITCHED)
Well, guys, how on Earth
are we going to do this?

06:59.086 --> 07:01.019
-Okay.
-Like this.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.161
Oh, yeah? Well,
if I'm going to enter her,

07:09.163 --> 07:11.897
I'm going to do it
the way God intended.

It's her happy place.

Let me have it. Yeah.

with a husband and wife
making love.

that kid, huh?

He's giving her the wood
like a good man should.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.792

in a coma is because...

10:00.667 --> 10:03.034
Diane! (SOBBING) You're back!

10:03.036 --> 10:05.070
And just in time
for Christmas!

10:06.639 --> 10:08.006
Oh!

10:08.008 --> 10:10.075
(MOANING)

10:10.077 --> 10:11.610
Oh, dear.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.278
(DIANE MOANING)

10:29.228 --> 10:31.529
Oh, man! I could really
never think of my...

10:31.531 --> 10:33.131
When I think
of my happy place,

10:33.133 --> 10:35.734
I have to really
consider some...

10:35.736 --> 10:37.969
Really, some asparagus.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.239
Yeah, man.
Asparagus is really good,
you know?

10:41.241 --> 10:44.676
(BLEEP) Like the hearts
of the (BLEEP), damn.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.678
Artichoke, artichoke heart.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.680
Oh, forget that. With garlic.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.448
Oh, my wife is
so good at that stuff.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.250
It's just
a little over-garlicky.
