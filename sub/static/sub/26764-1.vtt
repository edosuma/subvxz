00:30.701 --> 00:32.317
You're tipping your shoulder
before you throw the right.

00:32.317 --> 00:33.834
The hell I am.

00:39.742 --> 00:41.808
- When's tip-off?
- Eight.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.518
That's your pre-game?
That place's a rip-off.

00:43.518 --> 00:45.450
I'm not spending eight
bucks on a beer.

00:45.450 --> 00:46.463
I got a shift in the morning,

00:46.488 --> 00:47.761
so we should probably
take it easy tonight.

00:47.761 --> 00:49.203
Yeah. All right.

00:49.690 --> 00:51.150
Where are the seats?

00:51.770 --> 00:54.419
- They're ain't court-side.
- [INDISTINCT]

00:56.098 --> 00:58.345
I was your C.O.
We did two tours together.

00:58.371 --> 00:59.775
Hell, I took a bullet for you!

00:59.800 --> 01:01.523
You oughta know me better than that.

01:07.043 --> 01:08.219
There!

01:08.244 --> 01:09.508
You did it again!

01:10.180 --> 01:12.145
There's a place over on Franklin.

01:12.145 --> 01:13.883
Three dollar draft.
Pretty decent wings.

01:13.883 --> 01:15.265
That place is a dump.

01:15.290 --> 01:18.215
Yeah, I'm not exactly swimming
in EMT money, all right?

01:18.240 --> 01:21.335
My job at the VA barely covers my tab.

01:21.519 --> 01:22.767
I'm telling you,
you're tipping your strike.

01:22.792 --> 01:24.394
I can see it coming a mile away.

01:28.128 --> 01:30.155
Did you see that one?

01:31.095 --> 01:32.193
Nope.

01:39.561 --> 01:42.036
- You still hit like a girl.
- There's nothing wrong with that.

01:44.614 --> 01:45.642
Cool.

01:45.642 --> 01:47.152
You're done?

01:47.850 --> 01:50.594
I'm not the one getting my ass kicked.

02:11.835 --> 02:13.614
I taught you that.

02:13.678 --> 02:14.907
I know.

02:14.993 --> 02:17.498
All right. Come on.
We're gonna be late.

02:17.498 --> 02:18.971
Coffee's on you.

02:19.752 --> 02:21.641
What else is new?

02:26.896 --> 02:28.210
<i>Good morning, Portland!</i>

02:28.210 --> 02:32.020
<i>We start the hour with an update
from the Horace Hayes trial. Kelly?</i>

02:32.192 --> 02:33.888
<i>Yes, good morning, Tom.</i>

02:33.888 --> 02:36.634
<i>Well, there certainly is a
nervous energy in the air today</i>

02:36.634 --> 02:39.341
<i>with closing arguments being read
in the Horace Hayes trial...</i>

02:39.341 --> 02:41.721
<i>and deliberations set to
begin this afternoon.</i>

02:41.769 --> 02:43.672
<i>Well, many members
of the community</i>

02:43.672 --> 02:47.146
<i>fear another hung jury and the
possibility of Hayes walking free.</i>

02:47.174 --> 02:49.470
<i>The prosecution certainly
seemed confident</i>

02:49.495 --> 02:51.189
<i>as they convened in the hallway.</i>

02:51.214 --> 02:54.783
<i>And any updates on the rest of
the alleged Irish crime family?</i>

02:54.808 --> 02:56.838
<i>Yes, they pressed
the District Attorney to...</i>

02:56.838 --> 02:58.668
[PHONE RINGS]

03:00.101 --> 03:02.908
- Hey!
<i>- Yo, when's your Dad back?</i>

03:02.933 --> 03:05.086
I don't know.
Whenever they reach a verdict.

03:05.111 --> 03:07.907
<i>So, you've got the house
to yourself tomorrow night?</i>

03:07.932 --> 03:11.333
Yeah... but no, not gonna happen.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.543
<i>- What?</i>
- You know what!

03:13.591 --> 03:15.971
- I'm not having people over.
<i>- Why not?</i>

03:16.036 --> 03:19.382
- We've got finals next week, for one...
<i>- What if I invited Andrew?</i>

03:19.390 --> 03:21.987
- My Dad would kill me!
<i>- He'll never know.</i>

03:22.012 --> 03:23.562
That's not the point.

03:23.587 --> 03:25.363
<i>We'll keep it low-key.</i>

03:25.828 --> 03:26.978
Okay, fine.

03:26.978 --> 03:29.796
But just a couple of people.
That's it. I'm serious.

03:29.864 --> 03:31.060
<i>Yes!</i>

03:31.579 --> 03:33.825
I'll see you at practice.

03:40.172 --> 03:41.612
Can I help you?

03:46.701 --> 03:48.263
Get in the car, Sarah.

03:48.263 --> 03:49.913
How do you know my name?

03:53.123 --> 03:54.639
Circle around!

04:07.621 --> 04:10.182
- Where the fuck did she go?
- That way. Go!

04:35.203 --> 04:36.998
Come on, Sarah.

04:40.199 --> 04:42.411
We're not gonna hurt you.

04:57.577 --> 04:59.006
Sarah!

05:02.812 --> 05:04.670
Sarah!

05:13.638 --> 05:15.522
Sarah!

05:35.440 --> 05:36.677
I got her, Maddy!

05:36.677 --> 05:38.111
Get off me!

05:39.103 --> 05:40.956
You should have got in the car.

05:46.070 --> 05:48.173
What do you want from me?

05:53.360 --> 05:54.638
Put him on.

05:54.685 --> 05:56.975
Someone wants to say hi.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.729
- Sarah!
<i>- Dad!</i>

05:58.729 --> 06:00.047
- Oh, my God! Sarah!
- Hey!

06:00.067 --> 06:01.313
<i>Dad!</i>

06:01.745 --> 06:04.844
<i>Patrick, your daughter's gonna be fine.</i>

06:04.938 --> 06:07.936
<i>We just need to talk
about my father's trial.</i>

06:08.545 --> 06:10.276
What do you want from me?

06:10.301 --> 06:12.242
You hang the Jury,

06:12.508 --> 06:14.677
or we'll hang your girl.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.421
Get her in the car.

06:35.102 --> 06:36.682
Thanks for coming out
with me today, man.

06:36.682 --> 06:38.587
- I appreciate it.
- No worries.

06:38.639 --> 06:39.976
It's not like it was
my day off or anything.

06:39.976 --> 06:42.094
Come on, you might as well
get out and help some people out.

06:42.119 --> 06:43.543
Yeah, yeah...
Happy to help.

06:43.568 --> 06:45.896
I just didn't know the old
DVA made house calls.

06:45.921 --> 06:46.900
Normally we don't.

06:46.925 --> 06:50.051
Usually they have got me sitting
behind a desk filing claims.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.002
Can't stand being in the office.

06:52.033 --> 06:53.281
But every now and then,

06:53.281 --> 06:54.849
they let me get out,
make a few rounds,

06:54.874 --> 06:56.404
check-in on some vets.

06:56.423 --> 06:57.776
I'm good with people.

06:57.801 --> 06:59.895
- So, who are we checking on today?
- Tommy.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.919
Nam vet, won a Purple Heart.

07:02.051 --> 07:03.755
Squatting in this
building for two years.

07:03.755 --> 07:05.046
Can't seem to get him out.

07:05.046 --> 07:06.262
Does he have any family?

07:06.266 --> 07:07.408
No, not anymore.

07:07.408 --> 07:09.554
I got a place set up
for him and everything, but...

07:09.625 --> 07:11.652
I can't get through to him.

07:11.838 --> 07:13.114
What makes you think
he'll listen to me?

07:13.140 --> 07:14.929
Remember a kid named Robert Walker?

07:14.942 --> 07:16.636
Served with you in Afghanistan?

07:16.694 --> 07:19.350
Yeah, Robbie,
the sniper attached to our unit.

07:19.375 --> 07:22.139
Killed by roadside just
outside of in Kabul. Why?

07:22.657 --> 07:24.343
He's his father.

07:28.924 --> 07:31.117
This place looks like a war zone.

07:31.194 --> 07:32.726
Wait til you see the inside.

07:32.759 --> 07:34.938
Oh, hey, and heads-up about Graham.

07:34.963 --> 07:37.113
He's a little touchy,
but he's all right.

07:37.138 --> 07:38.902
He works for the landlord.

07:41.625 --> 07:43.267
You're late!

07:43.343 --> 07:45.059
I've been waiting out here for an hour!

07:45.084 --> 07:47.188
It's nice to see you too, Graham.

07:47.213 --> 07:48.617
Fuck you!

07:50.094 --> 07:51.814
He seems nice.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.087
People actually live out here?

08:11.087 --> 08:14.372
Oh, yeah. This place is
a squatter's paradise.

08:14.397 --> 08:17.017
Nobody tells them what to do,
and they get to run the land.

08:17.037 --> 08:18.339
In the middle of nowhere.

08:18.339 --> 08:21.204
Yap. Old Tom likes living off the grid.

08:21.229 --> 08:22.685
What's in the bag?

08:22.892 --> 08:24.643
Just a little care package.

08:24.678 --> 08:27.159
Bread, ding-dong, stuff like that.

08:27.447 --> 08:28.653
Who's this guy?

08:28.694 --> 08:30.595
This is my buddy Jake.
He's helping me out today.

08:30.595 --> 08:31.786
How you doing?

08:31.846 --> 08:34.477
Huh? Terrible, I said I'm doing...
I said I'd help but...

08:34.477 --> 08:36.548
- I don't like sitting around all day.
- Take it easy, Graham.

08:36.548 --> 08:38.082
We're gonna be in and out.

08:38.107 --> 08:40.389
All right. Let's get it over with.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.975
This place gives me the creeps.

08:42.017 --> 08:45.193
Yeah, I'm surprised they let you
out here all by yourself today.

08:47.609 --> 08:48.716
I'm not worried.

08:48.716 --> 08:50.527
You got a permit for that thing?

08:50.527 --> 08:51.648
Of course!

08:51.673 --> 08:52.812
I got it last week.

08:52.837 --> 08:54.116
I hope you'll never need it.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.137
A lot better to have one
and not need it.

08:56.162 --> 08:58.474
- Than not to have one...
- Graham, do us a favor...

08:58.525 --> 09:00.183
Keep it in your pants, all right?

09:00.183 --> 09:02.648
Don't want you shooting me by accident.

09:25.077 --> 09:26.533
Ugh!

09:26.852 --> 09:28.753
It smells great in here.

09:28.961 --> 09:32.386
Man, it usually looks like
a hobo hotel in this place.

09:32.411 --> 09:34.026
Where is everybody?

09:34.174 --> 09:35.586
No clue.

09:35.611 --> 09:37.852
Say Graham, when was the last time
you were out here?

09:37.877 --> 09:39.616
A couple of months ago.

09:39.859 --> 09:41.877
Last time I let you in.

09:45.607 --> 09:47.307
Hello?

09:47.462 --> 09:49.099
Hello?

09:50.379 --> 09:52.161
Hello?

09:54.907 --> 09:58.403
Man, it looks like somebody cleared
the place and kicked everybody out.

09:58.428 --> 10:00.928
Maybe they all got jobs.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.242
It seems they left in a hurry.

10:03.276 --> 10:04.767
They didn't even finish their dinner.

10:04.811 --> 10:06.450
It wasn't us.
You know, it's not worth the trouble.

10:06.450 --> 10:08.506
We kick them out, they come back.
We kick them out, they come back.

10:08.506 --> 10:10.408
Like a pack of strays.

10:10.546 --> 10:12.471
They're human beings.

10:12.555 --> 10:15.167
- Yeah, right...
- Hey!

10:15.259 --> 10:17.907
If you don't care about this people,
then why are you still here?

10:17.932 --> 10:19.612
We're big boys.
We'll be all right.

10:19.637 --> 10:22.302
No, no, that's not how it works.
I let you in, I let you out.

10:22.302 --> 10:25.488
- We don't a lawsuit...
- Look, you two, cut it out.

10:25.648 --> 10:27.937
All right?
We're on the same team.

10:46.703 --> 10:49.043
- Are you sure he's still here?
- I hope so.

10:49.130 --> 10:51.132
He lives in a storeroom at the back.

10:51.158 --> 10:53.081
How did you find this
guy in the first place?

10:53.106 --> 10:54.737
Graham called it in.

10:54.762 --> 10:57.047
He may be an asshole,
but he's not a monster.

10:57.072 --> 10:58.782
Thank you.

11:01.098 --> 11:03.872
Easy there, Rambo,
it's a raccoon.

11:03.904 --> 11:05.903
Graham, what did I say?
That things isn't a toy!

11:05.928 --> 11:07.551
- No, but I saw...
- Look...

11:07.576 --> 11:10.189
You pull the piece again,
I'm gonna make you eat it.

11:10.210 --> 11:12.529
- We understand each other?
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

11:27.630 --> 11:29.625
Tommy, open up!

11:30.313 --> 11:32.441
Tommy, it's Luke!

11:33.098 --> 11:35.134
Come on, Tommy.

11:36.146 --> 11:37.889
All right. We're coming in.

11:37.904 --> 11:39.699
Hope you're decent!

11:40.011 --> 11:42.141
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

11:42.479 --> 11:45.045
You ain't coming inside of nothing.

11:45.412 --> 11:47.067
This is my home.

11:47.092 --> 11:49.425
That's fine.
Take it easy.

11:49.883 --> 11:52.125
I already told you I ain't going.

11:52.221 --> 11:54.359
You hear me?
I ain't going!

11:55.344 --> 11:57.440
- You got something to say to me?
- No, no, no!

11:57.445 --> 11:59.892
Not me. You can stay here
for as long as you like.

11:59.894 --> 12:01.861
Tommy, look,
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:01.861 --> 12:05.358
It's me, Luke, from the VA,
we spoke last month.

12:06.633 --> 12:08.054
I'm still not leaving.

12:08.079 --> 12:11.799
That's fine. Why don't you
put that thing down? Okay?

12:11.799 --> 12:14.435
Please. Put it down.

12:16.726 --> 12:18.434
It ain't even loaded.

12:18.459 --> 12:21.044
Maybe you shouldn't go
pointing at people's faces.

12:21.069 --> 12:22.904
This is America, isn't it?

12:23.728 --> 12:25.858
I just wanted to check
and see how you're doing.

12:25.883 --> 12:27.495
I brought you some food.

12:33.716 --> 12:36.085
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Jake Carter.

12:36.096 --> 12:37.916
Is that supposed
to mean something to me?

12:41.930 --> 12:44.435
I served with your son in Afghanistan.

12:46.773 --> 12:48.304
Robbie?

12:48.806 --> 12:50.973
He was attached to my unit.

12:52.251 --> 12:53.806
Oh...

12:54.420 --> 12:56.153
He was a good boy.

12:56.391 --> 12:58.088
He was a good Marine.

12:59.522 --> 13:01.618
They brought him home in a box!

13:02.155 --> 13:03.636
Look, Tommy,

13:03.778 --> 13:05.668
why don't we sit down
for a second and talk?

13:05.668 --> 13:07.093
No, I don't think so.

13:07.127 --> 13:08.402
Come on, man,
we're just trying to help.

13:08.427 --> 13:10.122
Can't help. No one can help me.

13:10.147 --> 13:13.118
Just leave me be.

13:13.699 --> 13:16.640
I've asked you twice.
I won't ask you again.

13:20.658 --> 13:22.413
That went well.

13:22.804 --> 13:25.459
- Well, at least he didn't shoot us.
- Yeah.

13:25.484 --> 13:27.131
That's a plus.

13:30.182 --> 13:33.042
Oh, I gotta take this.

13:33.067 --> 13:36.139
Okay, come on. Time's up. Let's go.

13:36.356 --> 13:39.323
Yeah, I'll catch up with you.

13:39.348 --> 13:40.554
Hi!

13:41.936 --> 13:43.645

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.295
Thanks to him.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.091
Hey, thank you.

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.109
Thank you.
The officers told me what you did.

01:16:05.109 --> 01:16:06.796
I don't know what we would have done.

01:16:06.821 --> 01:16:09.685
- It wasn't just me.
- Soldier coming through.

01:16:10.442 --> 01:16:13.141
Hey, give me a second?

01:16:24.684 --> 01:16:26.969
Semper fi, brother.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.778
We're even.

01:16:43.752 --> 01:16:46.091
- Just give me a second.
- Sure.

01:16:55.826 --> 01:16:57.531
How are you doing?

01:16:58.486 --> 01:17:00.702
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:03.833
Just saying good-bye.

01:17:06.276 --> 01:17:08.732
I'm so sorry about Jake.

01:17:09.534 --> 01:17:12.060
You know, he'd do all again tomorrow?

01:17:13.967 --> 01:17:15.872
Even knowing the outcome.

01:17:21.285 --> 01:17:23.335
He died a Marine.

01:17:40.868 --> 01:17:43.305
I should probably go to the hospital.

01:17:44.656 --> 01:17:48.180
Yeah, I think that's
probably a good idea.

01:17:53.968 --> 01:17:55.120
Hey.

01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:58.572
Come on, we gotta
get you home, okay?
