01:07.150 --> 01:09.776
Time Portal deactivated.

01:10.652 --> 01:13.404
Perfect.
The preliminary run-through was perfect.

01:13.821 --> 01:15.323
Once the Governors arrive...

01:15.406 --> 01:17.782
we'll have the first official look
at living history.

01:17.866 --> 01:20.577
I set the coordinates
for the demonstration run-through...

01:20.660 --> 01:22.453
for Washington, D.C., 1978.

01:22.536 --> 01:25.663
- Are there any objections?
- No. You're the historian.

01:26.331 --> 01:30.000
They allowed individuals to accumulate
a massive fortune back then.

01:30.083 --> 01:33.836
It'll be fascinating
to watch a capitalistic society at work.

01:34.754 --> 01:37.006
Just so you maintain
the delicate balance...

01:37.089 --> 01:40.008
between physical science
and social science.

01:40.091 --> 01:43.010
That policy is 150 years old, Adam.

01:43.427 --> 01:44.887
I didn't institute it...

01:44.970 --> 01:47.763
and I didn't ask to be assigned
to your project.

01:49.806 --> 01:54.101
You deserve all the credit,
and you'll get all the credit. I promise.

01:54.935 --> 01:57.770
Isn't it about time
for the Board of Governors to arrive?

01:57.854 --> 02:01.982
Yes, I'm supposed to greet them.
This day is going to make history.

02:02.149 --> 02:05.526
- I can hardly wait to see their faces.
- And it's all because of you.

02:05.609 --> 02:09.904
After all, thanks to your genius,
the Time Portal practically runs itself.

02:25.416 --> 02:28.002
Time Portal, activate.

02:33.422 --> 02:38.175
Initiate Project W-36-9-7-8.

03:01.192 --> 03:03.194
Open Time Portal.

03:05.904 --> 03:07.406
Cassandra? What are you doing?

03:07.489 --> 03:10.950
I'm about to make all my knowledge
of the 20th century pay off.

03:16.621 --> 03:17.663
No!

05:13.248 --> 05:14.667
Cassandra, wait.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.752
I invented the Time Portal
to view the past...

05:16.835 --> 05:18.127
not to travel back through it.

05:18.211 --> 05:20.838
- You weren't part of my plan, Adam.
- What plan?

05:20.963 --> 05:25.132
To make myself a fortune in an era
when fortunes can still be made.

05:25.257 --> 05:28.135
- I never was the librarian type.
- Cassandra, you can't.

05:28.219 --> 05:31.179
Change the past and you change
the future, maybe disastrously.

05:31.262 --> 05:34.181
I could care less.
Now will you let go of me?

05:34.264 --> 05:37.099
Mugger! Help! Somebody help me!

05:41.394 --> 05:44.522
I'll stop you, Cassandra.
I have to stop you.

05:46.774 --> 05:48.776
Diana? You busy?

05:48.859 --> 05:50.068
I soon will be.

05:50.151 --> 05:53.236
Report on last week's
surveillance activities. Remember?

05:53.320 --> 05:56.615
Yeah. I guess you wouldn't want
to check out the purple explosions...

05:56.698 --> 05:59.200
- that just occurred at the Westside Plaza.
- Darn.

05:59.283 --> 06:03.203
Investigating purple smoke bombs
is one of my favorite assignments.

06:03.953 --> 06:06.705
Apparently, they weren't smoke bombs,
because they left no-

06:06.789 --> 06:10.291
Steve. Getting this report out
was your idea, remember?

06:11.459 --> 06:12.502
True.

06:12.585 --> 06:14.461
- Let me see what Lou's doing.
- Good.

06:21.966 --> 06:24.802
Would you mind explaining this,
Miss Loren?

06:25.135 --> 06:29.138
We both know that is the number
to a Swiss bank account...

06:29.472 --> 06:32.975
which contains $190,000...

06:33.642 --> 06:35.644
in embezzled funds.

06:36.061 --> 06:37.644
Correct, Mr. Reynolds?

06:44.150 --> 06:47.402
I think you'd better leave
or I'm gonna be forced to call-

06:47.486 --> 06:49.487
Call the police? Be my guest.

06:49.570 --> 06:53.490
I'm sure they'd be delighted
to have a bona fide white-collar criminal...

06:53.573 --> 06:54.908
thrown into their laps.

06:54.991 --> 06:58.493
Reynolds, I want those reports,
and I want them written in black ink.

06:58.577 --> 07:00.204
What is this, the cocktail hour?

07:00.287 --> 07:04.081
This is strictly business, J.J.
The reports are being copied right now.

07:04.165 --> 07:07.083
- I want them on my desk in 10 minutes.
- You'll have them.

07:07.167 --> 07:10.336
"Business"? In my day,
we used to call it something else.

07:11.795 --> 07:12.963
Lovely man.

07:13.713 --> 07:16.466
If he only knew
what his employees were doing...

07:16.716 --> 07:18.467
with his company's funds.

07:19.176 --> 07:23.512
Miss Loren, let me tell you something.
I don't like being blackmailed.

07:23.763 --> 07:26.639
I said nothing about blackmail,
Mr. Reynolds.

07:26.723 --> 07:29.266
I needed to gain your attention, that's all.

07:29.558 --> 07:32.102
You've got my attention. Now what?

07:32.186 --> 07:34.270
Now I'm going to tell you some things...

07:34.353 --> 07:37.772
that are going to prove very profitable
for both of us.

07:39.441 --> 07:41.692
But first, I think you'd better sit down.

07:45.653 --> 07:48.031
I'd forgotten all about these things.

07:49.197 --> 07:51.408
"Deposit coin and listen for tone. "

07:52.492 --> 07:53.868
Coin.

07:54.618 --> 07:56.120
Terrific.

08:03.208 --> 08:05.126
IADC, here we come.

08:11.173 --> 08:13.340
- Lunch?
- Sure.

08:13.424 --> 08:16.385
- But only half an hour's worth.
- That's good.

08:20.013 --> 08:21.513
Never fails.

08:23.056 --> 08:24.224
Hello?

08:24.641 --> 08:25.683
Who?

08:26.517 --> 08:28.519
I suppose. Put him through.

08:29.436 --> 08:30.520
Diana Prince here.

08:30.603 --> 08:32.731
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- Okay.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.482
Wait a minute. World security?

08:38.025 --> 08:40.278
Slow down. Who is this?

08:40.361 --> 08:43.363
Adam Clement. I'm a scientist.
A physicist, to be exact.

08:43.947 --> 08:46.866
If this is about those smoke bombs,
the police are handling it.

08:46.949 --> 08:50.160
Then your police should know
those explosions weren't made by a bomb.

08:50.243 --> 08:51.452
They left no residue.

08:51.536 --> 08:54.371
The reason why
is what I must talk to you about.

08:54.454 --> 08:56.456
- Diana.
- Hold on a minute.

08:57.331 --> 09:01.042
What he said about no residue is true.
Only it wasn't released to the public.

09:01.126 --> 09:03.962
Forget about the report.
You'd better check this out.

09:04.045 --> 09:07.381
Mr. Clement,
why don't you come down to our office?

09:08.173 --> 09:11.759
I don't really know my way
around Washington very well...

09:11.843 --> 09:14.219
but could you meet me
at the Westside Plaza?

09:14.302 --> 09:16.763
I can be there in half an hour.
Where do we meet?

09:17.054 --> 09:18.305
Can you meet me on the Mall?

09:18.722 --> 09:21.349
Certainly. Who am I looking for?

09:21.724 --> 09:23.560
Look for the man dressed in silver.

09:25.894 --> 09:27.271
Dressed in silver?

09:28.564 --> 09:30.565
Have you gone crazy, Reynolds?

09:30.898 --> 09:34.067
Are you asking me to believe
that she can predict the future?

09:34.150 --> 09:38.487
No, I'm asking you to believe
she knows things that nobody else knows.

09:38.821 --> 09:42.031
I know, for instance,
that the MacConnell Mining Corporation...

09:42.115 --> 09:44.158
is sitting on top of an energy source...

09:44.242 --> 09:47.244
which could put the oil-producing
countries out of business...

09:47.327 --> 09:50.162
and make you a billionaire overnight.

09:50.496 --> 09:51.914
We're drowning in red ink...

09:51.997 --> 09:54.416
and she's talking
about making me a billionaire.

09:54.499 --> 09:56.876
If you knew where to look,
and what to look for.

09:56.959 --> 09:58.210
Which I can tell you.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.879
Using ESP or whatever you call it?

10:00.962 --> 10:02.243
What garbage.

10:02.244 --> 10:04.923
I'm telling you, J.J.,
will you listen to her?

10:05.173 --> 10:08.176
I never expected you to take me
at my word, Mr. MacConnell.

10:08.260 --> 10:11.178
You're a businessman.
You want facts, proof.

10:12.096 --> 10:15.431
So, by tomorrow, the following will occur:

10:15.723 --> 10:18.809
The Delaney warehouse
will burn to the ground...

10:19.101 --> 10:22.269
a lost group of hikers will be found
on Martin Ridge...

10:22.937 --> 10:25.647
and Tazwell will be hit by a blackout.

10:25.897 --> 10:29.775
Yeah, that's proof, all right.
You're both out of your minds.

10:30.526 --> 10:33.820
Reynolds, I want you to get your stuff
and get out of here in 24 hours.

10:33.903 --> 10:36.614
Anybody that puts stock
in a lady tea-leaf reader...

10:36.697 --> 10:38.740
ain't working for any company of mine.

10:38.824 --> 10:41.784
Just be sure to read the morning paper,
Mr. MacConnell.

10:41.867 --> 10:43.911
I'll do that, lady.

10:59.339 --> 11:02.257
I could've sworn
it was just beyond these buildings.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.760
Or was it those buildings?

11:22.397 --> 11:25.483
Getting me fired wasn't part
of your little scenario, was it?

11:25.566 --> 11:27.360
You're still thinking like an employee.

11:27.443 --> 11:30.403
When the morning papers hit,
you'll have your job back and more.

11:30.487 --> 11:32.530
You're beautiful, you're cunning...

11:32.614 --> 11:35.616
and you've got me and old man
MacConnell by the short hairs.

11:35.699 --> 11:39.327
Only, he doesn't know it yet.
See how perfectly it all fits?

11:39.410 --> 11:43.038
If you were an honest man,
J.J. wouldn't be a desperate one.

11:43.330 --> 11:46.123
Larceny becomes you.

11:47.875 --> 11:51.586
- As it does you.
- We really are two of a kind.

11:52.587 --> 11:55.631
And right now, I need you...

11:55.714 --> 11:57.799
- Yeah?
- ... to kill someone.

11:58.591 --> 12:02.719
A man named Adam Clement.
The man who invented the Time Portal.

12:03.136 --> 12:05.137
The idiot followed me here by accident.

12:05.221 --> 12:08.390
We have got to stop him
before he interferes.

12:08.932 --> 12:12.851
My hunch is that he'll head
straight for the IADC.

12:13.310 --> 12:15.228
The IADC?

12:15.479 --> 12:19.565
His grandfather worked for them,
or will, in about 20 years.

12:22.067 --> 12:24.361
Just let me make a short call.

12:27.988 --> 12:31.407
Too bad, Adam.
You should've stayed where you belonged.

12:36.536 --> 12:37.661
Yes?

12:38.704 --> 12:40.831
You bet I'll take the call.

12:41.956 --> 12:45.500
I have better things to do
than to be stood up, Adam Clement.

12:45.584 --> 12:47.085
I'm sorry. I got lost.

12:47.169 --> 12:49.837
But it's still imperative that I see you.
Please.

12:49.921 --> 12:52.922
All right, where are you now?

12:53.173 --> 12:57.176
From here I can see a sign that says
"Winchester Observatory. "

12:57.259 --> 13:00.845
Winchester Planetarium?
Oh, boy, you really got lost.

13:00.928 --> 13:02.680
- Yes.
- Okay.

13:03.056 --> 13:06.850
Just don't move a muscle. I'm on my way.

13:07.309 --> 13:10.686
I just have to make a quick stop home
and change clothes.

14:25.992 --> 14:27.285
Adam?

16:53.101 --> 16:55.728
Okay, now you stay here.

17:23.123 --> 17:24.915
Tazwell will be hit by a blackout.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.214
The Delaney warehouse
will burn to the ground.

17:37.967 --> 17:40.678
A lost group of hikers will be found
on Martin Ridge.

17:46.432 --> 17:49.643
Put your things away, Dan.
You're not leaving. Yet.

17:51.269 --> 17:55.314
- Looks like you read the morning paper.
- All right, little lady.

17:55.522 --> 17:57.899
I'm not convinced. But I'm listening.

17:58.358 --> 18:01.401
You own the Broken Rock radium mine
in Arizona, right?

18:01.568 --> 18:04.279
Been trying to sell
that tapped-out hole in the ground...

18:04.363 --> 18:05.488
for two years now.

18:05.571 --> 18:09.783
That hole in the ground contains
a radioactive material called Cabrium-90.

18:09.866 --> 18:11.034
Never heard of it.

18:11.117 --> 18:13.327
Of course not.
It hasn't been discovered yet.

18:13.410 --> 18:16.038
But it soon will be. At Broken Rock.

18:16.288 --> 18:19.540
The only place where it's accessible
by current technology.

18:19.707 --> 18:22.000
What do I need you for, then?

18:22.083 --> 18:25.294
Because neither you nor anyone else
knows how to refine it.

18:25.377 --> 18:28.547
You own the mine,
but you can't make it pay without me.

18:28.631 --> 18:31.549
All right, what's the pitch?

18:31.883 --> 18:35.177
With three men and Mr. Reynolds...

18:35.761 --> 18:38.387
I'll put Cabrium-90 in production for you...

18:38.471 --> 18:42.140
in exchange for 51% controlling interest
in your company.

18:42.932 --> 18:45.059
Fifty-one percent!

18:45.225 --> 18:48.353
Think about it, J.J.

18:49.020 --> 18:51.064
We're on the verge of bankruptcy, right?

18:51.147 --> 18:55.734
It's either 51 % for her,
or 100% of nothing for you.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.319
You take your pick.

19:01.362 --> 19:04.324
It looks like I don't have much choice,
does it?

19:04.407 --> 19:08.493
Don't take it so hard, Mr. MacConnell.
You're about to become a billionaire.

19:25.881 --> 19:28.175
- I got great news for us.
- What?

19:28.258 --> 19:31.802
Clement got away,
and Wonder Woman threw our man in jail.

19:32.052 --> 19:33.636
Wonder Woman?

19:34.012 --> 19:37.014
I completely forgot
to take her into account.

19:37.097 --> 19:39.641
At least Clement doesn't seem to be
doing any talking.

19:39.725 --> 19:43.227
But Wonder Woman could've used her
lasso on that gunman to get your name.

19:43.311 --> 19:45.437
So what?
Anything she gets with that thing...

19:45.520 --> 19:46.938
isn't worth a dime in court.

19:47.022 --> 19:50.524
But the point is,
she and the IADC could start interfering.

19:50.608 --> 19:52.151
The more suspicious they are...

19:52.234 --> 19:54.360
the harder it will be
to get to that Cabrium-90.

19:54.444 --> 19:57.988
Don't worry. I've gotten very good
at covering my tracks.

19:58.071 --> 20:01.615
And we've got plenty of time
to arrange a mishap for Mr. Clement.

20:01.699 --> 20:04.909
Just make sure
that this time it's good and fatal.

20:09.747 --> 20:12.832
Reynolds, Daniel P. Age 38.

20:12.915 --> 20:15.918
Last president, MacConnell Mining Corp.

20:18.086 --> 20:21.380
Ira, the more you tell me,
the less sense it makes.

20:21.463 --> 20:24.091
According to Wonder Woman,
Reynolds hired a hit man...

20:24.174 --> 20:27.093
to take out a guy
who runs around in a silver jumpsuit.

20:27.176 --> 20:29.052
Repeat that, Steve Trevor.

20:29.970 --> 20:32.930
He says he's a scientist
by the name of Adam Clement.

20:33.055 --> 20:35.725
We had no locale on him,
but Diana gave us a description:

20:35.808 --> 20:39.769
About 5'10", blond hair, middle 20s.
You have anything on him?

20:43.939 --> 20:46.482
- Insufficient data.
- That's what I thought.

20:46.566 --> 20:49.901
Well, whoever he is, he says
that yesterday's purple explosions...

20:49.985 --> 20:53.279
that took place at the Westside Plaza
are a matter of world security.

20:53.362 --> 20:57.115
A man who wears a silver jumpsuit
cannot be taken seriously.

20:58.157 --> 21:01.285
Obviously Daniel P. Reynolds
thinks differently.

21:01.785 --> 21:03.870
Give me a complete readout on him, Ira.

21:03.954 --> 21:06.122
I wanna know
why he wants Clement dead.

21:06.205 --> 21:07.873
Through the room you have just seen...

21:07.957 --> 21:10.959
have passed some of the greatest
statesmen and women in history.

21:11.042 --> 21:13.961
Decisions of great national
and international significance...

21:14.044 --> 21:15.170
have been made there.

21:15.254 --> 21:16.629
The room we're about to enter...

21:16.713 --> 21:19.882
is used primarily for receptions
and other social gatherings.

21:19.966 --> 21:23.468
No doubt, many a mind has been changed
and many a vote of support given...

21:23.552 --> 21:26.137
during informal exchanges
at the punch bowl...

21:26.220 --> 21:28.721
making it no less important
than the first room.

21:32.599 --> 21:35.185
I realize this is unusual,
but I must see the President.

21:35.269 --> 21:36.311
The President?

21:36.395 --> 21:39.355
It concerns the security of this nation,
possibly even the world.

21:39.438 --> 21:40.523
The world?

21:40.605 --> 21:42.774
So if you would just take me to him.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.192
We'll take you someplace, all right.

21:45.276 --> 21:47.611
No, you have the wrong idea.
I'm not a crackpot.

21:47.695 --> 21:49.946
Someone must tell the President
what's happened.

21:50.029 --> 21:52.031
The Martians are coming, right?

21:55.534 --> 21:58.869
Thanks, Ira.
Reynolds shouldn't be that hard to-

21:59.120 --> 22:01.538
A White House security alert
is in progress.

22:01.621 --> 22:02.664
Any details?

22:02.747 --> 22:06.458
Communications indicate the intruder
is wearing an unusual silver jumpsuit.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.835
- Adam Clement.
- Logical conclusion.

22:08.918 --> 22:10.920
Diana's gonna love this.

22:21.803 --> 22:23.513
Engine, start.

22:26.390 --> 22:29.058
Definitely not voice-activated.

22:53.284 --> 22:54.827
I'm on my way, Steve.

23:18.512 --> 23:19.971
Are you okay?

23:20.305 --> 23:21.680
Are you all right?

23:21.764 --> 23:24.808
- That thing tried to kill me.
- I'm Diana Prince.

23:24.933 --> 23:26.851
You tried to kill me, too!

23:26.935 --> 23:30.062
No, I tried to help you.
Somebody else wanted you dead.

23:32.356 --> 23:34.523
Cassandra tried to kill me.

23:44.864 --> 23:46.449
- Yes?
- Hello.

23:47.033 --> 23:49.534
My name is Trevor. I'm with the IADC.

23:49.618 --> 23:53.454
I'm looking for Daniel Reynolds.
His office said he'd be at home today.

23:53.621 --> 23:56.581
I'm afraid not. I don't know where he is.

23:57.207 --> 24:00.751
- Any idea when he'll be back?
- I'm sorry, I don't.

24:01.251 --> 24:04.379
- Would you mind if I waited, then?
- Not at all.

24:04.545 --> 24:07.590
I was just about to take a bath.

24:09.299 --> 24:12.968
Never mind. Just give him my card
and have him call me when he gets back.

24:13.052 --> 24:16.013
- Miss...
- Yes, thank you very much, I will. Bye-bye.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.058
May I say, lady,
that you handled him perfectly?

24:21.141 --> 24:23.393
They're on to you.
All because of Wonder Woman.

24:23.477 --> 24:26.395
She's as meddlesome in the 20th century
as she is in the 22nd.

24:26.479 --> 24:28.439
We have to leave for the mine
immediately.

24:28.521 --> 24:31.649
But I've just arranged for somebody else
to get rid of Adam.

24:31.733 --> 24:34.234
We'll coordinate with him
by long distance.

24:34.818 --> 24:38.029
You know, if Adam does get to the IADC...

24:38.112 --> 24:41.573
it might just make it easier
to dispose of him.

24:42.365 --> 24:46.243
Lady, did I ever tell you
exactly how clever you really are?

24:49.871 --> 24:51.915
That was Cassandra all right, Steve.

24:51.998 --> 24:55.125
It fits Adam's description of her perfectly.

24:55.208 --> 24:59.253
The only thing we can do now
is try to keep an eye on her and Reynolds.

24:59.879 --> 25:03.048
I'd rather you talked to him tomorrow.
He's half-dead right now.

25:04.090 --> 25:07.051
Okay, I'll talk to you in the morning. Bye.

25:08.676 --> 25:10.928
- Hey, you look like a new man.
- Thanks.

25:11.012 --> 25:13.346
- That looks terrific.
- Good.

25:13.430 --> 25:16.391
- I'm sorry I ran off like I did.
- I understand.

25:16.766 --> 25:19.810
Falling back through 200 years of time
is bad enough...

25:19.894 --> 25:21.227
without being shot at.

25:21.311 --> 25:25.022
I think we'll go into the living room.
We'll be more comfortable there.

25:25.105 --> 25:28.233
You were very wise to call the IADC.

25:29.692 --> 25:32.861
I just don't know what effect
our being here will have on the world.

25:32.944 --> 25:35.405
You can't change the past
without changing the future.

25:35.488 --> 25:39.116
Who knows what terrible chain of events
Cassandra may have already triggered?

25:39.199 --> 25:41.034
Do you have any idea...

25:41.117 --> 25:44.287
why Cassandra hooked up
with MacConnell Mining?

25:46.413 --> 25:48.123
Sounds familiar.

25:49.540 --> 25:52.584
Look, no offense. The only thing
I wanna figure out right now...

25:52.667 --> 25:55.044
is how to get back to where I came from.

25:56.379 --> 25:58.547
Do you think that's realistic?

25:59.214 --> 26:00.299
Thank you.

26:00.631 --> 26:03.217
Most of the materials I used
to build the Time Portal...

26:03.301 --> 26:05.302
haven't even been invented yet.

26:05.844 --> 26:09.430
Come to think of it,
I could develop a remote-control unit.

26:09.513 --> 26:12.349
You see?
Necessity is the mother of invention.

26:12.433 --> 26:17.227
Tomorrow I'll get you a place to work
and the materials you need to get started.

26:17.311 --> 26:20.147
In the meantime, you must be exhausted.

26:20.314 --> 26:23.816
This couch is very comfortable,
and it's all yours.

26:25.275 --> 26:26.776
Thank you.

26:29.486 --> 26:33.156
You know, in my time, they have a policy:

26:34.157 --> 26:37.367
No research or development
can take place in any physical science...

26:37.450 --> 26:40.661
without concurrent study
of its ramifications on society.

26:40.744 --> 26:44.581
So you could tell how the people
are gonna react to the new technology.

26:45.665 --> 26:49.376
I never understood
why those restrictions were necessary...

26:50.294 --> 26:51.670
until now.

26:53.212 --> 26:57.007
Taking human nature into consideration
when you're inventing something...

26:57.090 --> 26:59.175
sounds like a good idea to me.

26:59.259 --> 27:01.468
When did that go into effect?

27:02.636 --> 27:06.389
Right after the nuclear holocaust.
2007, I think.

27:22.317 --> 27:24.819
Your man caused quite a stir today.

27:24.902 --> 27:27.989
Ran the White House
Secret Service men ragged.

27:28.072 --> 27:29.781
Now the IADC has him.

27:29.864 --> 27:32.616
Foreman says
we can start blasting anytime.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.118
They've got Adam.

27:34.201 --> 27:36.494
If I know Adam Clement,
the first thing he'll do...

27:36.577 --> 27:39.622
is develop some device
to take him back to 2155.

27:39.706 --> 27:43.041
You are to follow my instructions exactly,
Mr. Reves.

27:43.375 --> 27:47.086
For what you'll be paying me,
that's the least I can do.

27:47.253 --> 27:48.670
Just do what I say...

27:48.753 --> 27:51.798
and Adam Clement will be dead
within 24 hours.

27:57.093 --> 28:00.054
I looked and looked,
but this is all I could come up with.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.722
Looks to me like plain old ordinary quartz.

28:02.806 --> 28:06.850
Appearances are not your department.
Just set up the lamps like I told you.

28:06.934 --> 28:08.977
Yes, sir. Whatever you say.

28:11.521 --> 28:15.440
Now, let's see if all that research
I did as a historian pays off.

28:22.904 --> 28:25.531
I thought Cabrium-90
was supposed to be so powerful.

28:25.614 --> 28:28.533
Why do you think I need
only this tiny amount?

28:30.743 --> 28:34.412
Be careful, will you, please?
I'd like to be around to enjoy the profits.

28:34.496 --> 28:37.289
A little danger is tonic for the soul.

28:46.630 --> 28:49.590
There. Now, you ready for the light show?

29:13.149 --> 29:14.526
All right!

29:16.568 --> 29:19.488
Apparently, I made the mixture
a little too potent...

29:19.571 --> 29:21.572
but are you impressed?

29:21.656 --> 29:25.408
You kidding? A few rocks like that
could light cities from coast to coast.

29:25.492 --> 29:29.536
More like the entire world.
We're sitting on a fortune!

29:33.581 --> 29:36.334
I hope the clothes we got for you
aren't too uncomfortable.

29:36.416 --> 29:38.085
No, they're fine.

29:38.251 --> 29:41.253
Actually, they're not as bad as they look.
No offense.

29:41.420 --> 29:42.463
No.

29:42.630 --> 29:44.881
Diana's out scouting out
the rest of the parts...

29:44.964 --> 29:47.091
you said you'd need
to build the remote control.

29:47.175 --> 29:50.552
As for now, it may look a little crude,
but that's the best we can do.

29:51.428 --> 29:55.139
So, this is an IRAC computer.
Quite an antique.

29:56.473 --> 29:58.225
Ira, this is Adam Clement.

29:58.308 --> 30:02.269
Commit his voice to your memory banks.
He has complete security clearance.

30:02.353 --> 30:05.605
The IRAC computer is neither quaint
nor an antique.

30:05.688 --> 30:08.191
Voice capacity. Not as quaint as I thought.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.108
Ira, Adam is from the future.

30:10.192 --> 30:13.694
I'm sure we must all seem
a little old-fashioned to him.

30:15.154 --> 30:17.906
I think I'll leave you two alone now.

30:18.114 --> 30:19.783
All right, Steve.

30:24.577 --> 30:29.039
Okay, Ira. I need some data.
I'm sure you're capable of simple calculus.

30:29.456 --> 30:32.625
Given that "C" is a 60-cycle charge
and "R" its resistance...

30:32.708 --> 30:34.543
what's C cosine 4 over R?

30:35.294 --> 30:38.838
The IRAC computer
is neither quaint nor an antique.

30:38.922 --> 30:41.381
That isn't the answer I requested.

30:43.133 --> 30:45.968
Ira, I am not used
to quibbling with computers.

30:47.970 --> 30:50.847
All right. You're not a quaint antique.

30:51.056 --> 30:55.267
- The solution to your quotient is-
- You're a temperamental antique.

30:55.476 --> 30:57.351
Temperamental antique.

30:58.728 --> 31:02.189
Mr. Yamora? This is Diana Prince again.
How's that parts order coming?

31:03.398 --> 31:06.984
Hey, I'm sorry for the delay.
I'm number-one-son short today.

31:07.067 --> 31:10.153
- We're ready to deliver now.
- No, that's okay. Keep them there.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.362
I want my man
to check them out personally.

31:12.738 --> 31:16.532
You wanna pick them up yourself,
it's fine with me. What time?

31:16.824 --> 31:19.660
- How about 2:30?
- I'll be here.

32:00.024 --> 32:02.567
Here's the lot of them. An even dozen.

32:02.650 --> 32:04.735
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

32:04.943 --> 32:08.362
He's a real doll
for pulling this together so fast.

32:09.363 --> 32:13.783
So, tell me, what do government agents
do for entertainment after hours?

32:14.367 --> 32:17.327
My job doesn't leave me much free time.

32:18.412 --> 32:21.330
I do have friends, if that's what you mean.

32:21.831 --> 32:22.957
Why?

32:23.040 --> 32:26.126
Isn't romance alive and well in the future?

32:26.209 --> 32:28.586
Sure. I was just curious.

32:28.836 --> 32:31.380
From a historical perspective,
you understand.

32:31.463 --> 32:33.047
Yes, I understand.

32:35.091 --> 32:38.635
Everything you ordered seems to be here.
Maybe you'd better double-check it.

32:38.719 --> 32:41.887
- What's that?
- I don't know. It was with the rest.

32:43.556 --> 32:45.724
I just counted 12 boxes.

32:49.518 --> 32:50.602
Diana, what-

32:52.020 --> 32:54.272
This is a bomb. We gotta get out of here.

32:54.355 --> 32:56.731
Mr. Yamora! Get out of the building!

33:14.495 --> 33:17.122
"IADC scientist killed in freak accident. "

33:19.708 --> 33:20.958
"Accident. "

33:21.041 --> 33:23.585
Government press releases are so tactful.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.671
- Finally, we are home free.
- Almost.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.506
Blowing up an entire mountain
takes time, after all.

33:29.589 --> 33:30.799
Time?

33:30.882 --> 33:34.343
With Adam gone,
we have all the time in the world.

33:35.636 --> 33:38.805
At what sound-wave frequency
is the unit set?

33:41.473 --> 33:42.683
Adam Clement?

33:45.476 --> 33:47.144
Must've been daydreaming. Sorry.

33:47.228 --> 33:50.105
We were analyzing
the hypothetical stress accuracy...

33:50.188 --> 33:53.524
of your Time Portal remote-control unit
in operation.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.943
Yes, we've been through all that.

33:56.943 --> 33:58.611
Tell me more about Diana.

33:58.736 --> 34:01.738
You have already been given
complete data profile...

34:01.822 --> 34:03.740
With the exception ofher shoe size.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.533
I suppose you think that's funny.

34:05.616 --> 34:10.120
On the contrary.
Your fascination with her is very quaint.

34:10.203 --> 34:14.123
You're wasting time, Ira.
Tell me everything you know about Diana.

34:14.248 --> 34:16.791
- Everything?
- You can't refuse a direct request.

34:16.873 --> 34:19.960
You obviously have more information,
or you wouldn't be stalling.

34:20.043 --> 34:23.295
- Now let's hear it.
- I have concluded Diana Prince is-

34:23.380 --> 34:24.463
Hi.

34:24.547 --> 34:25.797
Disregard that.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.800
- How's it going?
- Fine.

34:27.882 --> 34:30.092
Find out anything
at the MacConnell Corporation?

34:30.176 --> 34:33.637
According to Steve, whatever
MacConnell knows, he's not telling.

34:33.719 --> 34:36.139
Your obituary was
in the papers, however...

34:36.223 --> 34:38.891
and so that should stop
the attempts on your life.

34:38.974 --> 34:41.351
Is this the remote-control unit?

34:41.434 --> 34:43.143
These parts will do fine.

34:43.228 --> 34:45.353
It's about 10 times bigger
than it should be.

34:45.437 --> 34:47.523
I had to use a 20th-century power pack.

34:47.606 --> 34:50.315
In my time, I'd have just fitted it
with a Cabrium-90 cell.

34:50.399 --> 34:52.775
- Cabrium what?
- Cabrium-90.

34:53.693 --> 34:56.612
It's a radioactive material
physically related to radium.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.990
Only one ounce of it can send a rocket
to the moon and...

35:00.074 --> 35:02.200
- That's it.
- What?

35:02.283 --> 35:05.035
The connection between Cassandra
and MacConnell Mining.

35:05.118 --> 35:07.329
Ira, does MacConnell own a radium mine?

35:11.666 --> 35:12.916
Adam, what is it?

35:12.999 --> 35:17.252
He owns an inactive mine
in Broken Rock, Arizona.

35:17.336 --> 35:20.130
That must be where she and Reynolds
have disappeared to.

35:20.713 --> 35:23.716
Cassandra is using her knowledge
of history to mine Cabrium-90.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.801
It was always found near radium deposits.

35:25.884 --> 35:27.928
Cassandra's going into mining?

35:28.302 --> 35:29.637
- Why?
- Money.

35:29.720 --> 35:33.181
She loved this time period
because of its obsession with money.

35:33.264 --> 35:37.351
What better way to make a fortune
than develop a new energy source?

35:37.434 --> 35:39.895
That must be it. And if it is...

35:41.729 --> 35:44.731
Diana, when Cabrium-90
was first excavated...

35:44.814 --> 35:48.317
it caused a devastating explosion.
It killed thousands.

35:48.734 --> 35:51.320
- How?
- I don't remember exactly...

35:51.403 --> 35:55.281
but a huge cloud of explosive gas
was released into the atmosphere.

35:56.157 --> 35:58.909
- Where? In Arizona?
- I wish I could remember.

35:58.992 --> 36:02.161
All I know is that an entire city
was half-destroyed.

36:02.453 --> 36:05.038
Ira, what's the nearest city
to Broken Rock?

36:05.121 --> 36:08.707
Phoenix. Population: 1. 1 million.

36:08.999 --> 36:10.417
At the present time...

36:10.501 --> 36:15.046
the probability that a gas cloud could be
carried over the city by headwinds...

36:15.129 --> 36:16.880
is extremely high.

36:16.963 --> 36:19.883
Cassandra could care less.
We've got to stop her.

36:19.966 --> 36:24.302
Ira, are you saying that gas cloud
could ignite over Phoenix?

36:24.719 --> 36:27.889
Could, and in all probability would,
Diana Prince.

36:44.609 --> 36:47.945
I know there are certain advantages
to riding by horse out here...

36:48.029 --> 36:50.572
but I sure wish
we could've taken a land vehicle.

36:50.655 --> 36:52.781
The mine's right over there.

37:01.455 --> 37:02.706
An arrowhead.

37:04.373 --> 37:06.208
Look at this thing.

37:06.834 --> 37:09.336
Adam, not right now, okay?

37:09.669 --> 37:11.963
Let's lead the horses from here.

37:18.676 --> 37:21.470
I swear I never drilled
so many blast holes in my life.

37:21.553 --> 37:24.972
I don't hear any complaints
about your salary. Are we all set?

37:25.055 --> 37:27.475
Except for the radio control.
Only take a jiffy.

37:27.558 --> 37:29.726
I wanna be able to detonate
from the cavern.

37:29.809 --> 37:32.061
Yes, ma'am. Good idea, too.

37:32.145 --> 37:35.856
When that mountain blows, you'll hear it
all the way to Phoenix and back.

37:35.939 --> 37:38.774
All the way, but not back.

37:46.905 --> 37:49.032
Well, what do we got here?

37:57.121 --> 37:58.956
I must say, Adam...

37:59.457 --> 38:02.167
you have more lives than a cat.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.334
At least he had an obituary.

38:04.418 --> 38:07.129
This poor lady,
nobody's even gonna know she's dead.

38:07.212 --> 38:10.548
Because there won't be
enough left of her to find.

38:12.008 --> 38:16.260
Killing us is one thing,
but destroying an entire city?

38:17.636 --> 38:19.346
What's she talking about?

38:20.346 --> 38:24.516
She didn't tell you about the pocket of gas
the explosion will release?

38:24.599 --> 38:27.686
That's strange.
I wonder what else she hasn't told you.

38:28.644 --> 38:30.354
What pocket of gas?

38:30.646 --> 38:34.691
Some history books claim a large cloud
of gas escaped into the atmosphere...

38:34.774 --> 38:39.111
- when Cabrium-90 was first mined.
- It's an historical fact.

38:39.194 --> 38:41.362
- Even I remember it.
- Adam, shut up.

38:41.446 --> 38:43.781
We're going to destroy a city?

38:44.364 --> 38:48.492
All right, do you think I'd be here
if there was any danger to us?

38:48.659 --> 38:52.829
- Why didn't you tell me about this before?
- Would you have told me?

38:59.710 --> 39:02.503
We really are two of a kind, aren't we?

39:04.379 --> 39:05.714
Poor Adam.

39:06.047 --> 39:08.507
How ironic
that you are about to be destroyed...

39:08.590 --> 39:10.801
by the very thing that you made possible.

39:10.926 --> 39:15.138
I shall be rich in the very best
of all possible times to be rich.

39:15.555 --> 39:16.888
And you shall be...

39:18.348 --> 39:19.391
dead.

39:33.234 --> 39:35.736
It's no use. We really are dead.

39:37.529 --> 39:41.657
Look, Diana, I just want you to know that-

39:42.241 --> 39:45.493
That arrowhead you found. Where is it?

39:59.337 --> 40:02.548
Good, everyone's here.
Is that the detonator?

40:02.714 --> 40:05.925
Yes, ma'am. Radio transmitter.
Nice and simple.

40:06.008 --> 40:07.760
Show me how it works.

40:07.969 --> 40:09.886
I want the pleasure.

40:15.933 --> 40:17.100
- Sorry.
- Okay.

40:21.770 --> 40:24.855
Here's to birds of a feather.

40:26.941 --> 40:28.900
Stop that, you fool.

40:28.983 --> 40:32.528
You set off the gas,
you'll blow us all to kingdom come.

40:34.071 --> 40:35.322
What gas?

40:55.337 --> 40:58.339
You can't do it. My family lives in Phoenix.

41:24.775 --> 41:26.485
Look, there it is.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.905
I've got to make sure
it explodes over the desert.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.031
- Stay here.
- What are you doing?

41:33.114 --> 41:34.699
Just stay here.

42:17.939 --> 42:19.191
I'm okay.

42:26.488 --> 42:29.740
No! Don't go out there.
The gas could still go off.

42:29.823 --> 42:32.033
As fast as it's going, we 're gonna be fine.

42:53.049 --> 42:57.010
- How did that happen?
- Look. There, that's how.

42:57.844 --> 43:00.095
Everybody, to the jeep, quick!

43:17.275 --> 43:18.401
Cassandra!

43:19.569 --> 43:20.611
No.

44:35.584 --> 44:38.752
Looks like the end of the trail
for you, Cassandra.

44:43.964 --> 44:47.092
Listen, you two better stand back.
Unless you want to go with us.

44:47.175 --> 44:50.511
Send me to prison, anything.
But just let me stay here.

44:50.594 --> 44:52.804
Nothing can be as boring as the future.

44:52.887 --> 44:55.890
Save it for the Board of Governors,
Cassandra.

44:58.642 --> 45:00.935
Diana, I'd like to...

45:03.896 --> 45:06.231
Thanks. For everything.

45:07.566 --> 45:10.192
Goodbye, Adam. I'll miss you, too.

45:29.289 --> 45:31.291
That takes care of them.

45:31.917 --> 45:35.128
As for Reynolds, this morning
he was indicted for embezzlement.

45:35.211 --> 45:38.463
Thanks to Wonder Woman, he doesn't
remember a thing about Cassandra.

45:38.547 --> 45:42.508
And J.J. MacConnell isn't about to talk
about her or Cabrium-90.

45:42.591 --> 45:45.635
Which is gonna stay right where it is,
for a long, long time...

45:45.718 --> 45:49.137
simply because nobody knows
how to put it to use. Yet.

45:50.556 --> 45:53.224
I wonder if, by blowing up that gas cloud...

45:53.307 --> 45:55.893
Wonder Woman actually changed history...

45:56.643 --> 45:58.144
or just postponed it.

45:58.228 --> 46:00.771
That's something
we'll probably never know.

46:13.155 --> 46:15.949
Handcuffs, and a letter, addressed to you.

46:18.701 --> 46:20.369
From Adam.

46:21.495 --> 46:23.831
"Dear Diana,
I'm returning your handcuffs...

46:23.914 --> 46:27.291
"since the Board of Governors
is caring for Cassandra's rehabilitation.

46:27.375 --> 46:30.210
"They're also replacing the Time Portal
with a view screen...

46:30.293 --> 46:31.836
"to prevent further such mishaps.

46:31.919 --> 46:34.880
"So be a good girl, 'cause I'll be watching.

46:35.839 --> 46:37.548
"It's a small comfort, though...

46:37.632 --> 46:41.259
"considering I never had the courage
to tell you how I felt about you. "

46:48.932 --> 46:51.518
I wish I could answer this somehow.

46:51.726 --> 46:54.520
But Adam won't even be born
for more than a century.

46:54.603 --> 46:57.563
I've got an idea. Why don't you give a note
to Wonder Woman?

46:57.647 --> 46:59.690
She could probably hold it until then.

47:01.900 --> 47:04.716
Maybe I'll do that.

47:43.213 --> 47:43.556
