WE MET TONY AND HIS WIFE SUSAN
IN JUNE, A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HIS

03:37.917 --> 03:42.655
95th BIRTHDAY.
IS THAT BOB HOPE?

YOU'RE GOING TO BE 95.

MOMENTS-- BUT SUSAN HAS TO DO

04:04.177 --> 04:10.750
MOST OF THE TALKING.
SHE SAYS HE FIRST GREW CONCERNED
ABOUT HIS MEMORY SIX YEARS AGO.
>> Susan Benedetto: WE CAME HOME

04:10.750 --> 04:14.020
ONE NIGHT, AND HE SAID, "SUSAN,"
HE SAID, "I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
REMEMBERING THE NAMES OF THE
MUSICIANS."

04:14.020 --> 04:17.490
AND--
>> Cooper: THE MUSICIANS HE WAS
PLAYING WITH?
>> Susan Benedetto: YEAH, ON S--

04:17.490 --> 04:22.495
WHO HE WORKS WITH ALL THE TIME.
AND SO, IT WAS UNUSUAL.
AND I SAID, "WELL, DO YOU WANT
TO GO SEE A DOCTOR ABOUT IT?"

04:22.495 --> 04:27.934
AND HE SAID, "I DO."
>> Cooper: DID YOU KNOW RIGHT
AWAY THAT IT WAS ALZHEIMER'S?
>> Dr. Gayatri Devi: YEAH.

04:27.934 --> 04:32.705
>> Cooper: DR. GAYATRI DEVI IS
TONY'S NEUROLOGIST.
SHE DIAGNOSED HIM IN 2017.
>> Cooper: DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS

04:32.705 --> 04:38.511

KNOWS.

STATION OF MEMORIES-- AND THE

HOW MUCH DOES TONY UNDERSTAND
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HIM
AT ANY GIVEN TIME?

05:03.803 --> 05:09.475

DIFFERENT.
TONY-- LATE AT NIGHT, SOMETIMES
EARLY IN THE MORNING, HE'S MORE

05:09.475 --> 05:14.747
ALERT, IF I CAN USE THAT WORD.
SO, I'LL TELL HIM, "TONE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ON '60 MINUTES'."
HE'S, LIKE, "GREAT."

05:14.747 --> 05:20.019
I SAID, "YOU REMEMBER THAT SHOW,
'60 MINUTES'?"
HE'S, LIKE, "I DO."
BUT IN ANY OTHER GIVEN MOMENT,

05:20.019 --> 05:23.756
HE WON'T KNOW.

YOU.

>> Cooper: HE DOESN'T KNOW HE
HAS ALZHEIMER'S.
>> Susan Benedetto: NUH-UH.

05:32.265 --> 05:39.505
>> Cooper: WHAT HE DOES KNOW IS
THAT HE'S AT HOME, NOT
PERFORMING ON STAGE.
HE'D CONTINUED TO SING AFTER HIS

05:39.505 --> 05:43.443
DIAGNOSIS... BUT THE PANDEMIC
TOOK HIM OFF THE ROAD.
SUSAN SAYS IT'S BEEN HARD ON
HIM.

GAYATRI DEVI, OUR DOCTOR, WHO

FOR HEARING.
THERE IS THE PART OF THE BRAIN

THE ASTONISHINGLY INTIMATE

16:41.066 --> 16:49.274
FOOTAGE WAS RECENTLY EXTRACTED
FROM A LONDON VAULT AND PLACED
IN THE CAPABLE HANDS OF
FILMMAKER PETER JACKSON.

16:49.274 --> 16:55.314
HIS RESULTING THREE-PART
DOCUMENTARY SERIES, "GET BACK,"
DROPPED LAST NOVEMBER ON
DISNEY+.

16:55.314 --> 17:02.755
AS JON WERTHEIM REPORTED AT THE
TIME, IT ADDS CONSIDERABLE LIGHT
AND JOY TO WHAT WAS ALWAYS
CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEATLES'

17:02.755 --> 17:11.096
DARKEST PERIOD.

>> Peter Jackson: IT WAS
FASCINATING.
AND AFTER 50 YEARS, YOU'D HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT

17:47.866 --> 17:51.904
EVERYTHING WITH THE BEATLES HAD
BEEN TALKED ABOUT.
EVERY BIT OF FILM HAD BEEN SEEN,
EVERY BIT OF MUSIC HAD BEEN

17:51.904 --> 17:57.743

>> Wertheim: FROM HIS BASE IN
NEW ZEALAND, DIRECTOR PETER

17:57.743 --> 18:07.352
JACKSON TOOK A BREAK FROM
DIRECTING BIG-BUDGET STUDIO
FILMS LIKE "LORD OF THE RINGS,"

HOW ABOUT CHANGING AROUND THESE
TWO, AND WHEN YOU SING "DON'T

18:27.773 --> 18:35.914
YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO LAST,"
WE SING, "IT'S A LOVE THAT HAS
NO PAST."
>> Wertheim: SO, GIVE US SOME

18:35.914 --> 18:42.387
HISTORICAL CONTEXT HERE.
UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS
THIS FOOTAGE SHOT?
>> Jackson: THEY'VE LOST WHAT

18:42.387 --> 18:48.293
THEY LOVED AS TEENAGERS.
THEY'VE LOST BEING THE FOUR GUYS
PLAYING IN A BAND.
SO, THEY'RE GOING TO RECORD A

18:48.293 --> 18:51.330
NEW ALBUM WITH SONGS THAT ONLY--
THAT THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO PLAY
LIVE.
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANY

18:51.330 --> 18:55.400
STUDIO TRICKS.
THERE'S GOING TO BE NO
MULTITRACKING.
AND THEY HAD TO-- THEY HAD TO

18:55.400 --> 19:01.673
FIGURE OUT WHERE AND HOW THEY
WERE GOING TO PERFORM TO AN
AUDIENCE.
>> McCartney: BOM, CHA, BOM-BOM.

19:01.673 --> 19:08.013
>> Wertheim: AS THE BEATLES
WROTE AND REHEARSED, THEY
ALLOWED A FILM CREW TO CAPTURE
EVERY RIFF, BOTH ON GUITAR AND

19:08.013 --> 19:12.518
IN CONVERSATION.
>> McCartney: I MEAN, CORNY IS
ALL RIGHT IN THIS ONE, BECAUSE
WHAT HE'S DOING IS CORNY.

19:12.518 --> 19:19.258
BUT SEE, THAT'S THE THING THAT
WILL MAKE IT NOT CORNY, IS IF WE
SING DIFFERENT WORDS.
SO IT'S-- "I'M IN LOVE FOR THE

19:19.258 --> 19:23.996
FIRST TIME."
>> Wertheim: THE MONTHS'-WORTH
OF FILMING YIELDED ONLY THE
FORGETTABLE 80-MINUTE

19:23.996 --> 19:33.872
DOCUMENTARY, "LET IT BE,"
RELEASED A YEAR LATER, AFTER THE
BEATLES BROKE UP.
A LIFELONG BEATLES FAN, PETER

19:33.872 --> 19:40.345
JACKSON HAD ALWAYS WONDERED,
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE
HOURS OF UNSEEN FOOTAGE?
>> Jonathan Clyde: SO, HERE WE

19:40.345 --> 19:46.285
ARE IN VAULT NUMBER THREE.
>> Wertheim: HIS TOLKIEN-LIKE
QUEST TOOK HIM DEEP UNDER THE
LONDON HEADQUARTERS OF APPLE

19:46.285 --> 19:52.190
CORPS, THE BEATLES' LABEL.
>> Jackson: THEY JUST SAID,
"WE'VE GOT IT ALL.
WE'VE GOT 57 HOURS OF FOOTAGE.

19:52.190 --> 19:58.430
WE'VE GOT 130 HOURS OF AUDIO."
AND THEN THEY SAID THAT THEY
WERE THINKING ABOUT MAKING A
DOCUMENTARY USING THE FOOTAGE.

19:58.430 --> 20:07.339
I JUST PUT UP MY HAND AND SAID,
"WELL, IF-- IF YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY TO MAKE IT?
DON'T-- PLEASE JUST-- THINK--

20:07.339 --> 20:13.345
THINK OF ME."
>> Wertheim: BACK IN NEW
ZEALAND, JACKSON BEGAN THE
ULTIMATE BINGE-WATCH, SCREENING

20:13.345 --> 20:22.454
THIS MUSICAL MOTHER LODE, FRAME
BY FRAME.
GIVEN THAT ANY BEATLES FAN WILL
TELL YOU THAT "LET IT BE" COMES

20:22.454 --> 20:30.562
SHROUDED IN SADNESS-- FOREVER
ASSOCIATED WITHTHE GREAT
DIVORCE IN ROCK AND ROLL
HISTORY-- JACKSON BRACED FOR THE

20:30.562 --> 20:34.700
GLOOMY WORST.
>> Jackson: I WAS WATCHING, I
WAS WAITING FOR IT TO GET BAD.
I WAS WAITING FOR THE NARRATIVE

20:34.700 --> 20:39.671
THAT I'D BELIEVED OVER THE YEARS
TO START HAPPENING.
I WAS WAITING FOR THE ARGUMENTS.
WAITING FOR THE DISCONTENT.

20:39.671 --> 20:44.276
WAITING FOR THE MISERY.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
I MEAN, IT SHOWS-- YOU KNOW, IT
SHOWS ISSUES.

20:44.276 --> 20:50.415
IT SHOWS PROBLEMS.
BUT-- BUT ANY BAND, ANY TIME,
HAS THO-- HAS THOSE-- HAS THOSE
PROBLEMS.

20:50.415 --> 20:54.586
THIS IS NOT A BAND THAT'S
BREAKING UP.
THESE ARE NOT GUYS THAT DISLIKE
EACH OTHER.

20:54.586 --> 21:08.066
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M-- WHAT--
WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE.
THAT'S NOT WHAT WAS BEING
FILMED.

21:08.066 --> 21:15.874
>> John Lennon: YEAH, BUT THE
>> Wertheim: HERE'S WHATWAS
BEING FILMED: THE FOUR
LIVERPUDLIANS IN THEIR LATE 20s,

21:15.874 --> 21:20.545
WORKING COLLABORATIVELY,
SURROUNDED BY A STRIKINGLY
SMALL, TIGHT ENTOURAGE.
THERE'S LINDA-- LINDA EASTMAN,

21:20.545 --> 21:31.223
AT THE TIME-- TAKING PHOTOS.
AND, OF COURSE, YOKO ONO.
AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE, LET'S
DISPENSE NOW WITH THAT FAMOUS

21:31.223 --> 21:35.827
BIT OF BEATLES BREAK-UP
MYTHOLOGY.
THE CASUAL FAN LOOKING FOR "YOKO
ONO BROKE UP THE BEATLES"

21:35.827 --> 21:41.867
MIGHT COME AWAY FROM THIS
DISAPPOINTED, I SUSPECT.
>> Giles Martin: YEAH, I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD THING, YOU KNOW.

21:41.867 --> 21:46.405
I MEAN, YOKO DIDN'T BREAK UP THE
BEATLES.
AND-- AND NO ONE THING BROKE UP
THE BEATLES.

21:46.405 --> 21:51.910
>> George Martin: THAT'S THE
ORIGINAL.
>> Giles Martin: THAT'S THE
ORIGINAL.

21:51.910 --> 21:56.048
>> Wertheim: GILES MARTIN IS THE
SON OF LATE BEATLES PRODUCER
GEORGE MARTIN.
GILES GREW UP IN THE BEATLES

21:56.048 --> 22:04.022
ORBIT, AND HAS SINCE REMIXED
MOST OF THE BAND'S ALBUMS.
WHEN PETER JACKSON ENLISTED HIM
FOR THIS SERIES, MARTIN PLOWED

22:04.022 --> 22:09.294
THROUGH ALL THE HUNDREDS OF
HOURS OF AUDIO AND VIDEO.
>> Giles Martin: YOU CAN SEE THE
CRACKS APPEARING.

22:09.294 --> 22:14.766
THE ONE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
IS THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHY
THEY WERE GETTING TIRED OF EACH
OTHER.

22:14.766 --> 22:20.272
BECAUSE YOU GET THE SENSE OF
WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE IN A ROOM
WITH THEM, WHICH IS SUCH A
PRIVILEGE FOR ALL OF US.

22:20.272 --> 22:28.180
>> Wertheim: DESPITE THOSE
CRACKS, THE BEATLES ALCHEMY
REMAINS POTENT.
>> Jackson: AT ONE POINT, WE

22:28.180 --> 22:36.021
HAVE FOOTAGE OF PAUL McCARTNEY
SORT OF STRUMMING ON-- ON HIS
BASS, WHICH HE USES AS A GUITAR
HALF THE TIME.

22:36.021 --> 22:44.596
JUST SORT OF STRUMMING.
I THINK IT'S EARLY IN THE
MORNING, AND THEY'RE WAITING FOR
JOHN TO-- HASN'T ARRIVED YET.

22:44.596 --> 22:57.309
HE'S JUST BIDING SOME TIME.
HE SLOWLY FINDS THE TUNE.
♪("GET BACK")
>> Jackson: AND SO, YOU SEE THIS

22:57.309 --> 23:02.781
SONG KIND OF JUST BE PLUCKED OUT
OF THIN AIR.
>> McCartney: LEFT HIS HOME IN
TUCSON, ARIZONA.

23:02.781 --> 23:07.352
>> Lennon: IS TUCSON IN ARIZONA?
>> McCartney: YEAH.
IT'S WHERE THEY MAKE "HIGH
CHAPARRAL."

23:07.352 --> 23:13.425
LIKE, I CAN MAKE SENSE OF IT.
JOJO LEFT HIS HOME, HOPING IT
WOULD BE A BLAST, PRETTY SOON HE
FOUND THAT HE'D HAVE TO BE A

23:13.425 --> 23:20.198
LONER WITH SOME CALIFORNIA
GRASS.
AND NOW YOU THINK, OKAY, THAT
MAKES SENSE, BUT IT DOESN'T SING

23:20.198 --> 23:28.140
GOOD.
>> Wertheim: THE BEATLES HAD
ALWAYS BEEN FURIOUSLY
PRODUCTIVE, BUT THIS WAS THE

23:28.140 --> 23:36.114
CREATIVE PROCESS IN DOUBLE TIME:
14 SONGS IN 22 DAYS.
WAS THAT AS MUCH AN ABSURD TIME
PRESSURE IN 1969 AS IT WOULD

23:36.114 --> 23:40.619
APPEAR TO BE TODAY?
>> Giles Martin: YEAH.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST BAND ON THE
PLANET, SAYING WE'RE GOING TO

23:40.619 --> 23:46.591
DO-- WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR FIRST
SHOW IN THREE YEARS, IN THREE
WEEKS' TIME.
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S

23:46.591 --> 23:54.299
GOING TO BE, AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT SONGS WE'RE GOING TO PLAY.
>> Wertheim: AS YOU LISTEN TO
ALL THE RECORDINGS FOR THIS

23:54.299 --> 23:58.970
PROJECT, WHAT IMPRESSIONS DID
YOU ARRIVE AT, IN TERMS OF THEIR
CHEMISTRY?
>> Giles Martin: MY IMPRESSION

23:58.970 --> 24:06.044
OF IT IS THAT PAUL AND JOHN KIND
OF KNEW THAT THEY WERE GROWING
APART, AND "LET IT BE" WAS
ALMOST LIKE A MARRIAGE THAT'S

24:06.044 --> 24:16.421
FAILING, AND THEY WANT TO GO
BACK ON THEIR DATE NIGHTS AGAIN.
>> Wertheim: COMPOUNDING
MATTERS, GEORGE HARRISON--

24:16.421 --> 24:24.262
RESTLESS IN HIS ROLE AND
BRISTLING UNDER PAUL McCARTNEY'S
DRVING AMBITION-- LEAVES THE
BAND AFTER A WEEK.

24:24.262 --> 24:28.567
>> Jackson: IT'S THE MOST LOW-
KEY WALK-OUT THAT YOU'VE EVER
SEEN IN YOUR LIFE.
IT'S JUST-- "I'M LEAVING NOW."

24:28.567 --> 24:33.505
"WHAT?"
"I'M LEAVING THE BAND NOW."
AND THEN HE GOES.
THERE'S NO FIGHT, THERE'S NO

24:33.505 --> 24:39.911
ARGUMENT, THERE'S NO
DISAGREEMENT.
>> Wertheim: JOHN WAS IN LOVE
WITH YOKO AND, IN HIS WORDS, HE

24:39.911 --> 24:46.351
WAS MISTREATING HIS BODY.
THE BAND WAS COMPETING FOR HIS
ATTENTION-- NOT ALWAYS
SUCCESSFULLY.

24:46.351 --> 24:52.257
>> Lennon: WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,
MUCH YOUNGER THAN TODAY, I NEVER
NEEDED ANYBODY'S HELP IN ANY
WAY.

24:52.257 --> 25:02.300
BUT NOW MY LIFE HAS CHANGED IN
OH-SO-MANY WAYS, A WOP-BOP-
ALOOMA, A-WOP-BAM-BOO.
>> McCartney: WE CAN'T CARRY ON

25:02.300 --> 25:08.340
LIKE THIS INDEFINITELY.
>> Lennon: WE SEEM TO BE.
>> McCartney: WE SEEM TO, BUT WE
CAN'T.

25:08.340 --> 25:16.514
SEE, WHAT YOU NEED IS A SERIOUS
PROGRAM OF WORK, NOT AN AIMLESS
RAMBLING AMONGST THE CANYONS OF
YOUR MIND.

25:16.514 --> 25:23.622
>> Wertheim: PAUL HAD,
GRUDGINGLY, BECOME THE BAND'S
HALL MONITOR, MORE LEAD THAN
SINGER.

25:23.622 --> 25:32.330
GEORGE WAS PERSUADED TO COME
BACK, BUT WITH THE LIVE
PERFORMANCE APPROACHING, THE
BEATLES DECIDED THEY NEEDED A

25:32.330 --> 25:39.170
CHANGE OF SCENERY.
THEY RELOCATED TO A MAKESHIFT
STUDIO IN THE BASEMENT OF APPLE
RECORDS.

25:39.170 --> 25:44.376
>> Lennon: I DIG A PYGMY BY
CHARLES HAWTREY AND THE DEAF
AIDS.
PHASE ONE, IN WHICH DORIS GETS

25:44.376 --> 25:55.954
HER OATS.
>> Wertheim: A SURGE OF FRESH
ENERGY ALSO CAME IN THE FORM OF

26:22.814 --> 26:28.219
COMES IN AND THEY JUST HAD TO
SUDDENLY IMPROVE THEIR PLAYING,
BECAUSE THEY HAD THIS FORCE OF
NATURE IN THE ROOM WITH THEM.

26:28.219 --> 26:34.926

I THINK HE WORKED AS A CATALYST
AND GALVANIZED THEM SO THEY

SCENE, AT ODDS WITH HOW SO MANY
REMEMBERED THAT TIME, NOT LEAST

BUT PETER JACKSON'S "GET BACK"

KNOWS THE DISCIPLINE REQUIRED IN

34:37.375 --> 34:44.382

IN 1981, HE AND HIS CLASSMATE,
RAY JOHNSON, WERE MARCHING IN A
MARDI GRAS PARADE FOR ST.

34:44.382 --> 34:55.092
AUGUSTINE WHEN AN ADULT WHO WAS
CHAPERONING THE BAND GOT INTO A
SCUFFLE WITH A PLAINCLOTHES
POLICE OFFICER.

>> Ray Johnson: AND THEN THE GUN
WENT OFF.
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE POLICE
STARTED SHOWING UP ON HORSEBACK

34:59.897 --> 35:04.435
AND THE BAND GOT DISARRAY AND
STUFF LIKE THAT.
SO, ONE OF OUR BARITONE PLAYERS
SAID, "RAY, YOU HAVE BLOOD ON

35:04.435 --> 35:10.241
YOUR UNIFORM."
AND THAT'S WHEN I STARTED
FEELING THE PAIN IN THE SIDE OF
MY FACE HERE.

35:10.241 --> 35:14.345
SO, THAT'S WHERE THE BULLET WENT
IN MY JAW AND CAME OUT THE BACK
OF MY NECK.
>> Alfonsi: YOU DIDN'T REALIZE

35:14.345 --> 35:18.149
YOU'D BEEN SHOT?
>> Ray Johnson: I DIDN'T KNOW I
WAS SHOT.
ONE POLICE OFFICER WAS TRYING TO

35:18.149 --> 35:25.690
GIVE ME FIRST AID.
SO, HE SAID, "LOOK," HE SAID, "I
GOT TO CUT THIS UNIFORM OFF YOU
TO SEE IF YOU'RE HIT ANYWHERE

35:25.690 --> 35:30.127
ELSE."
AND I SAID, "HOLD UP," I SAID,
"YOU CAN'T CUT THIS UNIFORM."
I SAID, "IT HAS BUTTONS ON IT.

HIM TO CUT THE UNIFORM?

THAT IF THIS MAN CUT THIS
UNIFORM, MR. HAMPTON WOULD
PROBABLY KILL ME.

LOST ITS EDGE.
RAY JOHNSON WAS HIRED BACK TO
