WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:05.830
You've been avoiding Dr Cox

00:05.920 --> 00:08.388
since Jordan told you
her baby was actually his.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.472
This chance meeting is a sign.
Time to let go of the secret.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.790
You just need to find a smooth way in.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.996
Hey, Dr Cox. T aking a whizz?

00:16.079 --> 00:19.311
We've been over this before, Newbie.
Eyes front, no talking.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.755
OK, fine, I'll just read the wall.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.149
"JD has a tiny pickle."

00:24.240 --> 00:27.312
Kudos for honesty there, Newbie,
but again no talking.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.356
Dr Cox, I have to tell you something.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.829
Aw, Perry, you pee standing up at work?

00:31.920 --> 00:36.072
That is so cute. Would you come on?
We're on a tight schedule.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.709
You know, with all the baby weight
you haven't lost yet,

00:39.800 --> 00:43.270
I went ahead and assumed
you'd be used to tight things by now.

00:43.360 --> 00:47.831
Aw, that's lovely. Well, hello, sailor.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.759
Ahoy.

00:50.840 --> 00:54.833
My goodness, Newbie, are you
so uncomfortable with Jordan here

00:54.920 --> 00:57.957
that you've in fact,
stopped peeing mid-stream?

00:58.040 --> 00:59.871
I may have.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.389
Yes!

01:02.480 --> 01:04.675
I wonder why Dr Cox
and Jordan got divorced.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.832
They act like they hate each other,
but that's just for show.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.239
Yeah, whatever.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.436
Are you going to stretch
before you play?

01:11.520 --> 01:14.956
Turk likes to blow off steam
by playing basketball before surgery.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.555
I always get my ass kicked
but not today.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.872
And that's game.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.711
How the hell did we lose?
We have Chet.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.519
- Sorry, man.
- Chet, you suck.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.435
You know what?
Some stereotypes are true, Turk, OK.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.229
And just maybe, black people
are a little better at basketball.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.151
What do you say?

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:59.920 --> 02:02.434
- Maybe a little.
- Y'all got hockey.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.477
Why do you think they got divorced?

02:19.560 --> 02:22.711
No idea. I can't believe
you had to pee in front of Jordan.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.836
I could not do that. Paul's my boyfriend

02:24.920 --> 02:26.990
and I make him turn the TV way up
when I go.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.959
Plus, he's not allowed in the apartment
an hour before or after I do twosies.

02:31.040 --> 02:33.429
You're a doctor.
Stop calling it twosies.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.512
Oh, with patients I say dookie.
Oh, dookie.

02:36.600 --> 02:40.115
Well, Maggie, I can only assume
you are wiling away the morning

02:40.200 --> 02:44.432
cat-chatting with your favourite gal pal
because you've finished pre-rounding.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.078
- Haven't started yet.
- What?

02:46.160 --> 02:48.196
- Gotcha. Finished.
- That's a good one.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.919
- Quite the prankster.
- I could tell some stories.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.197
If there's a God, you never will.
This is Mrs Grayson's chart.

02:54.280 --> 02:57.716
Her private-practice doctor
just showed up so I am off this one.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.792
Well, is there anything I need
to do for her lung nodule?

03:00.880 --> 03:03.235
I don't know, what do you say
start her on 20 CCs

03:03.320 --> 03:05.311
of "it's not my problem anymore?"

03:05.720 --> 03:08.029
Another pretentious private-practice guy

03:08.120 --> 03:10.998
who'll order me around while
he counts his money all day.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.197
- Hey, you must be JD.
- He knows my name.

03:14.280 --> 03:18.034
I'm Dr Fisher, I go by Pete. Never call
me Petey, we'll be friends for life.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.998
Look at this. Don't believe me?
I already got you a latte.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.911
- Thanks. A latte.
- That's funny.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.436
- We got a good one, Sally.
- How's that funny? Ah, just go with it.

03:26.520 --> 03:30.308
I always pull pranks. Before, Dr Cox
was like, "Did you do pre-rounding?"

03:30.400 --> 03:32.789
Sorry to interrupt.
I do wanna hear that story.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.155
Could you get a pulmonary consult
for Sally?

03:35.240 --> 03:36.673
Yeah...

03:36.760 --> 03:40.548
You're thinking why didn't you do that,
but would it overstep boundaries?

03:40.640 --> 03:42.995
What if I was a territorial ass
with a giant ego

03:43.080 --> 03:46.117
or a territorial ego with a giant ass?
Stop me, Sally!

03:46.200 --> 03:49.078
You're gonna help me.
Help me get Sally out of bed,

03:49.160 --> 03:51.754
That way, I can go back
to trying to get her into bed.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.751
- Stop!
- You stop, foxy lady.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.718
You're doing great.
From now on, follow your instincts.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.268
And you, don't flirt so much.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.792
Wanna make him jealous?

04:01.880 --> 04:02.995
No.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.230
Thanks a latte. Thanks a lot.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.117
Thanks a latte. I got it!

04:10.840 --> 04:14.116
At a hospital, there's always
one sure way to deal with boredom.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.317
You guys wanna go laugh
at the narcoleptic guy?

04:17.399 --> 04:21.029
It's insensitive, but let's face it,
narcolepsy is a funny condition.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.953
And it can be triggered
by a number of things.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.359
Like stress.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.830
Or anger from, say,
three double bogies in a row.

04:31.960 --> 04:35.589
- Or, in Mr Hilliard's case...
- Sexual arousal?

04:36.320 --> 04:38.470
I'm going in.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.632
Is falling asleep after sex
considered narcolepsy,

04:41.720 --> 04:44.393
cos if it is, Mr Roberts has got it.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.917
First she'll stick her chest out
and then she'll toss her hair.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.353
That's sexy.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.750
- Pen drop.
- Oops.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.873
That did it.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.718
Hell, yeah.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.110
I have a boyfriend. Work is going well.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.555
I feel cute
for the first time in my life.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.676
My self-esteem cannot be touched.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.035
It's been so weird since I got engaged.

05:12.120 --> 05:15.078
You're right, I'll never get married.
Message received.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.594
- This is about me.
- Really? Oh, OK.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.796
I don't feel attractive at all lately,

05:19.880 --> 05:21.950
Iike I've lost my spark or something.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.759
Remember what Kelso said
about your hair yesterday?

05:24.840 --> 05:26.478
It makes you look frumpy.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.553
- I thought he said clumpy.
- How is that better?

05:30.640 --> 05:32.790
You don't know.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.433
- Morning, boys.
- Sir, this is where we play.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.308
Funny, I thought
this was where we worked.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.392
Dr Kelso, I have a low anterior
resection this afternoon

05:46.480 --> 05:49.438
and I'd really like to exercise
in order to be at my best.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.988
Well, I'd really like grandkids someday,

05:52.080 --> 05:56.039
but the last five Christmases, my son
has brought his roommate Brad home,

05:56.120 --> 05:58.429
so you tell me whether life is fair.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.596
You did your residency here, too?

06:02.680 --> 06:06.150
Are you kidding me? We lived, we loved,
we sang, for crying out loud.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.630
Laverne, remember that time
you and I got a little crazy, right?

06:09.720 --> 06:12.871
Went down to the waterfall,
stripped off our scrubs, dove in.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.235
- Remember?
- You hitting the crack pipe?

06:15.320 --> 06:18.118
That's the kinda magic
I'm talking about, buddy.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.668
- Hey, ladies.
- You must know each other.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.955
- Dr Cox.
- Petey.

06:24.960 --> 06:29.636
Sometimes in an awkward situation,
it's best to go to your happy place.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.233
It's not uncommon.

06:31.320 --> 06:35.074
A lot of people keep plants
in their apartment. Right, JD?

06:35.160 --> 06:37.515
Jay, you're so crazy.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.350
We have a little history, yeah.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.599
What's up his pooper?

06:49.680 --> 06:53.116
He's mad cos I went into private
practice and he's in this hellhole.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.838
That guy was my mentor, man.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.309
I lived and breathed
for that guy's approval.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.515
That's lame.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.670
Once you learn his tricks, it's easier.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.193
- Tell me about it.
- Yeah.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.998
No, I'm serious. Tell me about it.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.316
Well, you know
when he gets on his rants,

07:07.400 --> 07:11.154
he gets all hyped up, his veins stick
out of his neck and he starts yelling?

07:11.240 --> 07:14.277
When he's done, look at him,
stare him in the eye and say,

07:14.360 --> 07:16.237
"I'm sorry, what were you saying?"

07:16.320 --> 07:18.470
I don't know why, but it works.
Trust me.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.199
How do you get him
to stop calling you girls' names?

07:21.280 --> 07:23.748
- Girls' names?
- Oh, never mind.

07:27.560 --> 07:28.913
Dookies.

07:30.240 --> 07:33.277
- I've got to get this thing fixed.
- Allow me.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.679
May l?

07:34.760 --> 07:35.909
Ah, yep.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.070
See what you got here is a Medicom XJ.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.118
It has a hip guard. I'm guessing
it's always coming loose.

07:41.200 --> 07:45.398
- It is always coming loose.
- Been there, seen it, fixed it.

07:45.480 --> 07:48.199
- Give that a try, missy.
- Thank you.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.909
For what? For doing my job? This kinda
thing gets me up in the morning.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.991
That and the smell of urinal cakes.

07:57.040 --> 08:00.430
- I'll see you around. Have a good one.
- Back at you.

08:01.920 --> 08:05.276
- What are you smiling about?
- I just made a new friend.

08:10.760 --> 08:14.309
This is so unfair. Everyone has a way
of taking the edge off.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.870
You and l, we've got basketball,
Nurse Roberts has got her stories.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.076
Some guy named DRK
loves Ms Pac-Man,

08:20.160 --> 08:22.276
cos he's got the high score
of 41 million.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.998
DRK?

08:24.720 --> 08:25.869
Dr Kelso.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.517
Ms Pac-Man, I would sex that bow
right off your head.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.398
Eat those dots,
you naughty, naughty girl.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.433
- Hey, Dr Cox.
- Hey, buddy.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.158
I was just thinking about you.

08:48.240 --> 08:52.233
How it might be nice to have somebody
around here who could help me out.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.515
Somebody I could call,
gosh, my resident,

08:54.600 --> 08:56.875
and we'd do stuff together,
medical stuff.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.554
It would just be peaches.
But then it occurred to me

08:59.640 --> 09:03.713
a guy who looked a hell of lot
like you used to be that guy.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.916
Monica, just because
you have a new buddy

09:06.000 --> 09:08.833
doesn't mean you can suddenly
drop your regular duties

09:08.920 --> 09:11.229
and I know
I just said "drop your duties."

09:11.320 --> 09:13.356
And so help me God,
if you even smile

09:13.440 --> 09:15.874
I will crush you
into two little Newbie cubes

09:15.960 --> 09:19.748
and hang you from my rearview mirror.
What you gotta say for yourself?

09:19.840 --> 09:21.353
Just do it.

09:21.440 --> 09:23.749
I'm sorry, did you say something?

09:25.320 --> 09:28.995
Welcome to today's lecture: the
Biomechanical Reaction Of Dr Perry Cox

09:29.080 --> 09:30.752
When He's Not Being Listened To.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.558
Stage one: The Jaw Clench.

09:34.280 --> 09:38.432
Quickly followed by stage two:
Syllable Elongation.

09:38.520 --> 09:42.718
Newbie, I re-hee-hee-ly
don't have time to repeat myself.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.349
Finally, stage three, Cox begrudgingly
offers a little respect,

09:46.440 --> 09:49.273
then distances himself
by overusing the word "there."

09:49.360 --> 09:52.397
But I gotta give it to you there
for yanking my chain there.

09:52.480 --> 09:53.799
There.

09:53.880 --> 09:57.156
The young soldier is offered a prize
for his courage.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.831
Get ready.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.356
I'll tell you what there, Newbie.

10:05.440 --> 10:08.079
If you wanna
stick around and help me out

10:08.160 --> 10:10.833
with Mrs Riley's
pericardiocentisis after work,

10:10.920 --> 10:12.433
that'd be great.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.353
I knew this was his way
of reaching out, but still...

10:15.440 --> 10:17.954
- I have plans tonight.
- What plans?

10:18.040 --> 10:20.600
Think of something believable.
Grandma died.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.636
No, if she does die, you'll feel awful

10:22.720 --> 10:25.518
and she's no spring chicken.
I should call her.

10:25.600 --> 10:29.388
But when we talk, I have nothing to say.
How about asking me how I am for once?

10:30.040 --> 10:32.076
- Newbie.
- My grandma died.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.272
Hello, Mr Hilliard.

10:38.360 --> 10:39.759
Hey.

10:41.840 --> 10:45.071
I just wanna make sure
you're comfortable.

10:45.160 --> 10:48.391
- Who are you?
- They call me Carla.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.311
OK, Carla it is.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.836
Mr Hilliard?
Do I have something on my...

10:56.360 --> 10:57.634
...Iips?

10:57.720 --> 10:59.870
Nope. Totally clean.

11:05.320 --> 11:08.517
I felt guilty about blowing off Dr Cox
to grab a beer with Pete.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.195
Of course, that was before
we got Nancy as our waitress.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.113
The kid's a doctor, for crying out loud,
he saves lives.

11:15.200 --> 11:19.273
That's worthy of your respect, or at
least one drunken weekend in Vegas.

11:19.360 --> 11:22.318
- Three-day weekend.
- Three-day weekend. Columbus Day.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.834
That's coming up, right? Come on.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.354
Everyone deals with problems
in their own way.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.517
Some lash out at others.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.278
Some just end up lashing out
at themselves.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.068
And some people just try to hide.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.276
Nancy. Nancy.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.039
Unfortunately, that never works.

11:55.400 --> 11:58.836
Hey, Dr Cox. Look, I'm so sorry
I lied to you last night.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.797
I should've told you I was with Pete.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.838
Did we just slip
into some alternate dimension

12:03.920 --> 12:06.718
where I give a flying duckie
about what you say and do?

12:06.800 --> 12:09.394
I know he's in private practice
and everything,

12:09.480 --> 12:11.277
but Pete's a really cool guy.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.920
He is a bad guy.
And Newbie, if you're smart,

12:14.000 --> 12:15.638
you will stay away from him.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.551
Oh, my God.

12:17.640 --> 12:21.110
You're actually jealous that
I'm hanging out with another doctor.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.270
- No, I'm not.
- Laverne?

12:23.360 --> 12:25.271
- Jealous.
- Ta-da!

12:25.360 --> 12:28.875
Marsha, if I were you,
I'd drop this jealousy thing right now.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.758
Don't worry about it, champ.
It's all right to need me.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.072
Touchdown.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.231
- Hi, Happy.
- I'm hideous.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.311
I can't even get Todd
to make a sex joke.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.038
Watch this.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.714
Todd, I'm out of extra-long
tongue depressors.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.792
- Do you have one for me?
- Sorry, Carla, I'm all out.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.598
How did he not say,
"ln my pants?"

12:50.680 --> 12:53.399
What is so different
about me since I got engaged?

12:53.480 --> 12:57.075
Wait. I found one. It's not made
of wood, but give me a minute.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.114
Have you checked
Mr Oberman for hypertension?

13:01.200 --> 13:03.760
Because I've got hypertension
right here.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.239
No way...

13:06.840 --> 13:08.353
Boobies.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.839
Charts.

13:15.200 --> 13:19.273
- I know it was you.
- You mean this right here?

13:19.360 --> 13:22.193
- This is mine from home.
- 40 million, son.

13:22.280 --> 13:25.875
Do you know how many patients
I had to ignore to get that high score?

13:25.960 --> 13:28.190
- People died.
- Well, what about me, sir?

13:28.280 --> 13:30.191
I need to play basketball.

13:30.280 --> 13:34.034
Since you lost that stupid game,
aren't you more stressed than usual?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.639
Open! Open! Open!

13:42.000 --> 13:44.992
- Maybe a little.
- So what do we do now?

13:46.080 --> 13:48.719
Now, this is how you relieve stress.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.592
Dammit to hell.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.758
The janitor's a nice person?

13:56.840 --> 13:58.319
He is such a sweetie.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.837
I'll ask him an innocuous question,

14:00.920 --> 14:04.276
and his answer will be filled with hate.
Filled with it.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.271
- How's it going?
- Very well, sir.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.316
Thank you for asking.
How are you?

14:08.400 --> 14:11.312
- Do you not see the hate?
- What is wrong with you?

14:14.920 --> 14:16.592
- That was a good one.
- I think so.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.669
All right. Go.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.716
Hold it. No.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.392
He's doing it.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.279
What's the deal, Alpha Dog?
Gonna cut me some slack?

14:27.360 --> 14:29.874
Petey! Petey! Petey!
Petey! Petey! Petey!

14:29.960 --> 14:33.396
OK, good answer.
I understand you're seeing Jordan again.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.835
I just wanted to say,
seriously, good for you.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.275
Know what would be
seriously good for you?

14:38.360 --> 14:41.716
- More bran in my diet?
- Never mention Jordan again.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.552
Do you guys mind if I turn on CNN?

14:43.640 --> 14:46.473
My grandma bought me a stock.
I wanna see how it's doing.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.028
Look at Rockefeller.
Pass me the remote, buddy?

14:49.120 --> 14:52.032
Cool, these guys are finally
starting to get along.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.031
- Or not.
- No big deal.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.918
I'll do one of
these to change the channel.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.076
We can just leave it on this station.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.594
Mr Hilliard, I like my body.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.272
- OK.
- I didn't always.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.032
When I was ten years old,

15:11.120 --> 15:13.554
my swim coach told me
my butt stuck out too much.

15:13.640 --> 15:17.474
Now I like it when my boyfriend
looks at my wagon and goes, bam!

15:17.560 --> 15:19.437
You know? I'm OK with my curves.

15:19.520 --> 15:23.274
Women inject God-knows-what
into their face to have lips like mine.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.998
Mr Hilliard!

15:25.080 --> 15:26.559
I can hop out of the shower

15:26.640 --> 15:29.359
and look at my body for ten seconds
without losing it.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.830
That's more than most women.
But when I can't make you fall asleep,

15:32.920 --> 15:37.630
it's like hearing my swim coach's voice
again. And my body doesn't deserve that.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.676
- What can I do?
- Fall asleep.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.591
- I'm not attracted to you.
- Why?

15:41.680 --> 15:44.638
- You remind me of my sister.
- But I'm not your sister.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.110
That's what I'm talking about.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.669
- Had to be done.
- OK, terrific.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.149
Grown-ups tackle each other
all the time.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.196
I can't change what already happened.

15:58.280 --> 16:01.431
But believe me, I never meant
to come between you and anyone.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.273
Watching Dr Cox and Pete
fight over me was...

16:04.360 --> 16:06.715
Oh, hell, I'll say it. It was awesome.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.678
You went and took something
that did not belong to you.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.876
A little possessive, but I'm flattered.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.632
Worse than that,

16:13.720 --> 16:16.792
you did it knowing full well
exactly how I felt about her.

16:16.880 --> 16:20.190
He just wouldn't be Dr Cox
if he didn't refer to me as a her.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.352
Hey, for what it's worth,
I didn't make the first move.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.510
That's a lie. You bought me a latte.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.637
Hey, guys.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.836
We were having problems.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.753
Problems that you knew about
because I confided in you.

16:34.840 --> 16:38.879
What did you do with the information?
You used it to get Jordan into bed.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.713
- Didn't you?
- Perry, come on.

16:42.680 --> 16:43.874
Go.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.752
And finally the reason Dr Cox
and his wife got divorced

16:49.840 --> 16:51.671
became abundantly clear.

16:55.480 --> 16:56.515
Yes.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.795
Get in there.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.599
- Say it.
- I'm your bitch.

17:01.680 --> 17:05.832
Don't be too hard on yourself. You've
only been playing this for 56 years.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.912
Dr Kelso, is this young man
a guest of yours?

17:10.520 --> 17:13.637
Dave,
I've never seen him before in my life.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.358
Really?

17:15.440 --> 17:18.512
Dave. Hey, man, you don't got...

17:18.599 --> 17:21.955
Yeah, I do.
Don't you run from me.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.679
Kelso!

17:27.079 --> 17:29.435
Hey, hey, Jack Daniels, what's crackin'?

17:29.520 --> 17:31.988
My cousin's volleyball team
has a game tonight.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.674
Tall girls, tiny shorts. You in?

17:34.760 --> 17:37.069
- I think I'm gonna pass.
- I get it.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.720
Still in Perririno's corner.
That's OK, buddy.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.836
Look, just a word to the wise,
all right?

17:41.920 --> 17:44.195
Just be careful
who you hitch your wagon to.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.759
I mean that.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.070
Yikes. I gotta go. OK?

17:48.160 --> 17:49.798
Hi. Can I buy you a house?

17:49.880 --> 17:52.235
I guess sometimes
it comes down to loyalty.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.833
Hey, Dr Cox.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.115
Still no talking in the bathroom,
Newbie.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.113
- Know what's weird?
- That you're allowed to talk?

18:03.200 --> 18:06.636
I never blamed Jordan. I was chief
resident, I was here all the time,

18:06.720 --> 18:09.393
and I always made damn sure
she knew she came second.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.518
But God Almighty,
I'm trying harder this time.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.636
I just hope I'm doing the right thing.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.156
Who cares if Jordan wants to keep it
a secret? Tell him it's his baby.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.629
Scream it from the mountains.
Dr Cox!

18:22.960 --> 18:24.632
- Oh, there you are.
- Hey, babe.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.517
Hi, handsome. How are you?

18:27.360 --> 18:30.557
Oh, hello, DJ.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.200
- Hey, Jordan. How you doing?
- Oh.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.477
Around here, you have to grab hold
of the littlest victories.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.919
Whether it's victories
over your insecurities.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.352
Dr Kelso...?

18:47.800 --> 18:49.950
Or security's victory over you.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.599
Kelso!

18:55.760 --> 18:59.275
Either way,
you've got to choose your battles.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.477
I want you to tell her the truth.
T ell her that you're a surly,

19:02.560 --> 19:04.835
devious, horrible excuse
for a human being.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.838
Who's that?

19:09.120 --> 19:12.032
- It's my son.
- Oh, my God, JD.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.076
I'm sorry, I didn't even see him there.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.310
No, no, no. I'm glad he heard it.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.188
I think it's important he sees
how the world treats people like us.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.952
I'm so sorry.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.070
Who the hell are you?

19:27.160 --> 19:29.390
Go on. Beat it.

19:30.720 --> 19:31.994
Scram!

19:32.720 --> 19:34.836
All right, stick around.
