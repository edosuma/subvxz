00:17.700 --> 00:19.800
Hurry up!

00:30.400 --> 00:34.100
Uh, next time, maybe take a leak
before we leave work.  Okay, Dipwads?

00:34.100 --> 00:36.700
Can you read sign language, Guy?

00:36.700 --> 00:40.100
Is that your IQ or the number of
Dipwads your mother had?

00:56.600 --> 00:59.100
Not you, too, Sandy?

00:59.100 --> 01:02.200
Sorry, man. You got to
hold it till you get home.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.200
See you tomorrow, Sandy.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.600
Hey, Sandy, chop chop.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.100
Hey, Sandman?

03:30.800 --> 03:34.200
Hey... Hot Dog, come on. Carpe Diem.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.800
Using a process that restores
moisture to the documents...

05:19.800 --> 05:23.300
...and by a reassembling of fragments
I should be able to recover a large...

05:23.300 --> 05:26.500
...percentage of the case material that
was destroyed in my office fire...

05:26.500 --> 05:29.000
...several months ago.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.600
And while this process will be
tedious and ongoing what I've already...

05:32.600 --> 05:37.000
...recovered will allow Agent Scully and
I to begin work on the X-Files immediately.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.000
Agent Mulder...

05:43.000 --> 05:45.400
Agent Mulder, I'm reading here a very...

05:45.400 --> 05:49.500
...pie-in-the-sky report about
global domination plans by vicious, ...

05:49.500 --> 05:52.500
...long-clawed spacelings?

05:52.500 --> 05:56.200
Is there going to be data to
back this vague, omnibus account?

05:56.200 --> 05:57.000
Yes.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.800
I see your renowned arrogance
has been left quite intact.

06:00.800 --> 06:05.100
You're asking us to accept this
report of a spaceship buried under...

06:05.100 --> 06:09.100
...polar ice and your
death-defying escape from it?

06:09.100 --> 06:12.300
The ice had become superheated
by the ship as it rose...

06:12.300 --> 06:14.300
...beneath us, causing the ice to collapse.

06:14.300 --> 06:18.700
This entire story is essentially unintelligible and,
therefore, encourages unintelligible analysis.

06:18.700 --> 06:23.700
Well, I was hoping that you'd look more closely at the
reports of mine and Agent Scully's medical conditions.

06:23.700 --> 06:28.700
These spacelings, Agent Mulder...
They weren't something I saw in Men in Black?

06:30.200 --> 06:33.100
I didn't see Men in Black.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.700
Well, it's a damn good movie.

06:34.700 --> 06:39.600
As much as this all may sound like science-fiction
we can and will prove the validity of our report.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.800
And, so, the plot...
I-I'm just trying to get this straight.

06:42.800 --> 06:48.800
The plot is for these spacelings to take over
the planet aided by a group of men here on earth?

06:48.800 --> 06:51.200
A shadow conspiracy
within our own government.

06:51.200 --> 06:56.700
Who are growing corn in the middle of the desert
which features pollen which was genetically altered...

06:56.700 --> 07:02.500
...to hold a virus which will be taken
away by bees whose sting transmits the virus, ...

07:02.500 --> 07:08.100
...causing the growth of an extraterrestrial
biological entity inside the human host?

07:08.100 --> 07:13.100
Which we will prove now that
the X-Files have been reopened.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.800
Your presumption, Agent Mulder, is far greater
than the case you make for that eventuality.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.300
I'm not sure I understand.

07:18.300 --> 07:22.800
You're here to justify your reassignment on
the X-Files with little more than a rattletrap account...

07:22.800 --> 07:24.900
...of high adventure in the Antarctic.

07:24.900 --> 07:28.000
Not to mention some very
questionable travel expenses.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.700
Let us remind you that the FBI is not a school for
science or for the grinding of personal axes...

07:33.700 --> 07:37.500
...and, hopefully, you will be able to
present us with some material evidence...

07:37.500 --> 07:39.600
...to support a continued investigation.

07:39.600 --> 07:44.500
Agent Scully was assigned to
the X-Files as a scientist.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.800
Was stung by one of these bees
and was infected with this virus.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.300
She is here today with hard
and incontrovertible evidence...

07:51.300 --> 07:57.600
Scientific proof that the virus she
was infected with is, in fact, extraterrestrial.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.900
Next time, I'll wear a
clown suit and do balloon tricks.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.500
Mulder, I was hoping it wouldn't come up.

08:11.500 --> 08:15.700
The only reason I was in there was because you assured
me there was a scientific basis for what we saw.

08:15.700 --> 08:17.900
Mulder, let me remind you once again...

08:17.900 --> 08:19.300
What I saw was very little.

08:19.300 --> 08:24.200
Look, Scully, that excuse is not going to work this time.
You were there and you were infected with that virus.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.200
Mulder, yes there is a scientific
basis for what happened to me.

08:27.200 --> 08:33.799
I was exposed to a virus but as it turns
out, Mulder, that virus is not what you thought.

08:33.799 --> 08:37.900
Look, I can't identify it, Mulder...
I have run three separate tests...

08:37.900 --> 08:43.400
...but I can tell you without a doubt that that virus' DNA
and proteins are very much of this world.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.800
I saw what that virus did.
I saw it generate a new being...

08:46.800 --> 08:48.900
An alien being inside a human body.

08:48.900 --> 08:56.100
It attacks and destroys human cells but
that is all it does, Mulder. It creates nothing.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.100
Look, I don't like telling you this.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.200
And I know that you don't want to hear it...
Not that you can't question me...

09:02.200 --> 09:06.500
...and what I saw but what you
can't question is the science.

09:17.300 --> 09:21.200
There was some sloppiness in
Phoenix where they found the body.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.000
The local PD got involved.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.300
These were taken at the
scene by a crime reporter.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.000
These were run in the press?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.700
I trumped up a story
about a crazy Indian on the loose.

09:31.700 --> 09:36.400
Never underestimate the public's
willingness to blame the Red Man for...

09:36.400 --> 09:39.400
- ...anything they can't explain.
- How did this happen?

09:39.400 --> 09:44.300
He was one of ours. He must've accidentally
injected himself while he was working on the virus.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.400
It took just 12 hours for the creature to gestate.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.700
This thing's alive?

09:49.700 --> 09:51.000
Yes.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.000
It's killed a man.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.600
- It's out there somewhere?
- As far as I know.

09:57.600 --> 10:01.500
God almighty, we can't
have this thing running loose.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.200
I'm managing the situation.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.200
You can manage all you want.
Someone's got to find this thing.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.000
Someone has to kill it.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.200
The response must be equal to the threat.

10:12.900 --> 10:16.200
Can you dispose of this problem?

10:18.400 --> 10:19.400
Yes.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.700
You're wasting your time.

10:26.700 --> 10:30.500
You need evidence to justify our reassignment.
I've just got to bring it back from the ashes.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.300
Nothing you might restore is
going to help you, Agent Mulder.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.800
It's over and done.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.900
Your reassignment on
the X-Files has been denied.

10:38.900 --> 10:42.300
How can it be denied? We're the only reason the
X-Files were reopened in the first place.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.000
There's no other reason to reopen them.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.600
- I'm not arguing...
- Well, then, who is?

10:46.600 --> 10:51.600
When will you accept that no amount of pressure or
reason will bring to heel a conspiracy whose members...

10:51.600 --> 10:55.000
...walk these halls with absolute impunity?

10:57.800 --> 10:59.900
Was there a vote?

11:02.300 --> 11:04.800
Unanimous against.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.000
Excuse me.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.800
I'm no help to you outside the
majority, Agent Mulder.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.800
Inside or out, I don't see that
there's a damn thing you can do for me.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.800
You can break their backs, Agent Mulder,
with the proof about this virus.

11:35.800 --> 11:40.600
- Proof that what you say it does is true.
- I don't have that proof just yet.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.100
Maybe I can give it to you.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.700
There's a file folder.

11:50.100 --> 11:53.000
It's on the desk in your old office.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.100
Is that something for me?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.100
Agent Mulder?

12:22.100 --> 12:24.100
Yeah, if you're doing my filing.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.500
Your filing?

12:25.500 --> 12:27.600
What are you doing in
my office, Agent Spender?

12:27.600 --> 12:32.300
I think there's been a miscommunication.
I think someone failed to inform you.

12:32.300 --> 12:37.300
If you're about to tell me that you were sent down here to
work on the X-Files I think the failure is simple judgment.

12:37.300 --> 12:41.100
I don't care what patronage got you this job.
I put my life in here.

12:41.100 --> 12:44.500
I'm not going to let some brown-nose
just slide in and take it all away from me.

12:44.500 --> 12:49.400
I don't believe in your work, in the paranormal mumbo
jumbo. So, don't presume I'm the one taking your place.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.300
No? Who is?

12:57.300 --> 12:59.000
Fox.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.400
Diana, back on your feet.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.800
I guess that's the only way
you could stab me in the back.

14:04.800 --> 14:09.900
I need the patient bandaged and dressed.
We'll be taking a trip.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.700
You want him what?

14:12.700 --> 14:16.000
I'm sure I don't need to repeat myself.

14:16.500 --> 14:19.000
Please get the boy ready.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.000
But doing that now could kill him.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.700
Let me put it to you simply:

14:23.700 --> 14:27.100
it's him or it's us.

14:49.700 --> 14:54.400
Mulder, I just want to remind you that by not informing
local PD we are in technical violation of...

14:54.400 --> 14:58.700
...state laws prohibiting
contamination of a crime scene.

14:59.100 --> 15:01.300
Why do I bother?

15:05.200 --> 15:08.300
Scully, come here and take a look at this.

15:11.300 --> 15:14.200
Ever seen anything like this?

15:14.700 --> 15:15.900
What are they?

15:15.900 --> 15:22.200
According to the investigator's notes in the file they're
from an attack by a Native American man on a scientist.

15:22.800 --> 15:28.000
- With what kind of weapon?
- It says in the file he used his bare hands.

15:28.300 --> 15:31.000
His bare hands?

15:31.300 --> 15:33.400
Mulder, this is hardwood.

15:33.400 --> 15:37.300
This kind of gouging didn't
happen with anybody's bare hands.

15:38.300 --> 15:41.400
Not without the use of
some kind of an implement.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.900
What is that?

15:49.800 --> 15:52.900
Somebody broke a nail.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.800
Is it animal?

15:55.800 --> 15:58.100
It ain't RuPaul.

15:58.100 --> 16:04.600
The body of the other victim was found
here on the sofa his viscera torn from his torso.

16:04.600 --> 16:09.100
But the MEs report says that the times of
death were hours apart which means that this victim...

16:09.100 --> 16:12.200
...was dead hours before the second attack.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.000
So the attacker never left.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.800
There wasn't an attack. I think it
was celebrating its birthday.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.600
The first victim must have gotten
infected with the virus somehow.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.000
Right here on the sofa was
where the creature was born.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.600
- Mulder...
- That would account for the violence...

16:25.600 --> 16:27.200
...done to the man's torso.

16:27.200 --> 16:31.400
The virus producing an extraterrestrial
biological entity that ripped away his chest as...

16:31.400 --> 16:34.600
...it birthed itself right here.
Look.

16:38.300 --> 16:43.400
Mulder, given the scenario that you just described, the
rate of gestation would have been less than a day.

16:43.400 --> 16:47.000
It would have been about 12 hours, in fact.
Okay, forgive the scientific argument...

16:47.000 --> 16:51.200
...just for a moment but you're saying
this was done by something newborn?

16:51.200 --> 16:53.600
That's exactly what I'm saying.

17:02.700 --> 17:05.599
It was here...

17:06.900 --> 17:09.400
But it's gone now.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.400
I should take a look.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.599
It's not here.

17:15.599 --> 17:19.000
Why don't you believe me
when you're so afraid of me?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.200
I'm not afraid of you.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.800
You think I can destroy you
for what I know, because of what I am.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.599
You're thinking you
could've destroyed me, too...

17:26.599 --> 17:30.200
...and if I don't find this creature, you will.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.200
He'll find it.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.500
I don't see there's any argument here.

17:40.700 --> 17:43.200
You admit yourself that
the crime report is a lie.

17:43.200 --> 17:47.100
Mulder, that doesn't mean that
I can just accept your theory.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.400
What does it take? For this thing
to come up and bite you on the ass?

17:51.400 --> 17:54.800
I saw these creatures.
I saw them burst to life.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.900
You would've seen them, too but
you were infected with that virus.

17:56.900 --> 17:59.300
You were passed out over my shoulder.

17:59.300 --> 18:03.000
Mulder, I know what you did.
I know what happened to me...

18:03.000 --> 18:06.700
...but without ignoring the science, I can't...

18:06.700 --> 18:11.200
Listen, Mulder... You told me
that my science kept you honest.

18:11.200 --> 18:16.200
That it made you question your assumptions.
That by it, I'd made you a whole person.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.500
If I change now...

18:19.500 --> 18:24.300
It wouldn't be right... or honest.

18:24.300 --> 18:30.500
I'm talking about extraterrestrial life
alive on this planet in our lifetime.

18:30.500 --> 18:35.800
Forces that dwarf and
precede all human history.

18:36.300 --> 18:40.200
I'm sorry, Scully, but this
time your science is wrong.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.500
Wake up, Homer.

19:25.500 --> 19:29.700
I was awake.
I was just thinking.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.000
Yeah, that would be a first.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.200
You're ten minutes late
on your systems check.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.100
If there was a problem,
we would have heard about it.

19:37.100 --> 19:41.500
Like Arizona's going to go without
air conditioning for ten minutes.

19:51.400 --> 19:56.500
Hey, Homer, got something
here in the bleed cooling system.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.100
See that?

20:02.300 --> 20:04.200
Five degrees off.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.300
- Might be...
- Might be in the core reactor.

20:06.300 --> 20:09.700
No, no, no. It's got to
be a monitoring glitch.

20:09.700 --> 20:13.600
Phone could start ringing any minute.
You might want to check it out.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.100
All right.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.600
Authorized officers and personnel only.
This is a closed area.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.900
What happened here?

22:02.900 --> 22:06.100
- You'll have to leave, Agent Mulder..
- We received a call that a man was killed here.

22:06.100 --> 22:09.300
A call from whom?
Assistant Director Skinner?

22:09.300 --> 22:10.800
Let us through.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
You're unauthorized to be here.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.600
You've ignored your superiors and
come here without cause or permission.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.800
I'm going to get you censured for this
and demand a review of AD Skinner's actions.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.100
Diana, let us in here.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.800
I can't. This facility has
been sealed off by the NRC.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.000
A man was murdered.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.100
A workman was killed in an accident in
a reactor where there was a systems failure.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.700
- Then why are you here?
- We were called because of a possible...

22:34.700 --> 22:37.300
...connection to two previous deaths.

22:37.300 --> 22:40.800
From a case file that was
stolen from our office.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.400
There is a connection.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.000
Let's get out of here, Mulder.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.000
I hope you know what
you're doing, Diana.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.600
I hope you know whose
errand you're running.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.400
I think I do.

22:58.700 --> 23:01.800
You weren't getting anywhere, Mulder.
It was only making it worse.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.100
It's here, Scully, and they know it.

23:04.100 --> 23:07.400
How do they know?
Mulder, how do you know?

23:07.600 --> 23:10.200
Give me the keys and get in the car.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.700
Oh, my God.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.600
Gibson.

23:20.100 --> 23:24.300
Sorry, sweetie. Gibson?

23:24.300 --> 23:26.200
Gibson?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.300
Gibson, sweetheart?

23:28.300 --> 23:30.100
Oh, God.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.400
Frankenstein? Really?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.200
No.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.400
No, you've been worked
on by some good doctors.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.500
They did a fine job with your stitches.

24:14.800 --> 24:18.000
You think they were butchers.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.900
They were butchers.

24:22.100 --> 24:25.100
They should have changed
your bandages, Gibson.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.200
You've got some swelling and some infection...

24:30.200 --> 24:32.800
...and you've got a fever.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.900
Why did they do this to you?

24:36.900 --> 24:39.800
'Cause I can read people's minds.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.400
How did you get in our car?

24:45.400 --> 24:48.200
When they weren't looking, I snuck away.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.800
It's easy when you know
what they're thinking.

24:52.100 --> 24:53.600
Why are you here?

24:53.600 --> 24:58.000
They were using me 'cause
I can communicate with it.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.700
Communicate with what?

25:02.700 --> 25:08.100
You already know.
You just don't want to believe it.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.700
The kid could find this thing.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.900
Mulder, this kid belongs in a hospital.

25:23.900 --> 25:27.200
- We could get his fever down.
- Mulder, you can't just take him on some snipe hunt.

25:27.200 --> 25:31.900
He's in no condition. He belongs in a
bed under constant medical care.

25:31.900 --> 25:35.400
Listen to me. What I'm saying is
in your best interest, okay?

25:35.400 --> 25:40.700
We have to take every precaution. We have to make every
effort to ensure that nothing happens to this boy...

25:40.700 --> 25:46.000
...because whatever he is, whatever gives
him the ability to do what he does, ...

25:46.000 --> 25:49.500
...he's your scientific evidence.
It's just like we said.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.000
He could be the key to
everything in the X-Files.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.900
- We don't have the X-Files.
- No, but what if he could corroborate...

25:55.900 --> 25:58.200
...everything that you're saying?

25:59.300 --> 26:03.200
This boy could be our last, best chance.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.900
Agent Mulder.

26:31.200 --> 26:36.000
Fox, I'm going to get out of the car.
I'm alone, all right?

26:40.300 --> 26:42.200
Diana, what are you doing here?

26:42.200 --> 26:46.500
I couldn't say anything to you earlier.
I was given this assignment, Fox, okay?

26:46.500 --> 26:49.800
They offered it to me.
I took the chance...

26:49.800 --> 26:50.900
I'm listening.

26:50.900 --> 26:55.700
...to make sure someone served your interests.
Someone who believes in the work.

26:55.700 --> 26:59.500
Hey, you and I found the X-Files together.
Don't forget that.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.800
- Who sent you?
- I'm here on my own.

27:01.800 --> 27:02.600
Why?

27:02.600 --> 27:06.800
- To convince me of your noble intentions?
- Listen to me. That thing is somewhere inside...

27:06.800 --> 27:13.000
...the Number Four reactor building. Now, we can
let them find it and destroy it or go find it ourselves.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.900
You need proof, Fox.

27:15.900 --> 27:20.300
You're so close.
Why can't you see that?

27:33.100 --> 27:35.300
Mulder, what's going on?

27:35.300 --> 27:38.200
- You take Gibson.
- Where are you going?

27:38.200 --> 27:40.900
To find this thing.

27:53.500 --> 27:58.300
Agent Spender and I got a call. We were on a
plane within an hour in constant contact.

27:58.300 --> 27:59.400
With who?

27:59.400 --> 28:02.400
The nuclear regulatory people.
NRC was first on the scene.

28:02.400 --> 28:06.900
They found the victim but by the time we got
there it had been removed. We never saw the body.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.800
- Who removed it?
- I don't know.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.000
Couldn't get a straight answer.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.800
Then the NRC sealed off the Number Four reactor
due to a problem with the heat transfer systems.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.600
I believe that was legitimate.

28:18.600 --> 28:23.400
Maybe that's why it's there.
It wants heat. It needs heat.

28:23.400 --> 28:27.700
This thing gestated abnormally fast.
What if heat activates it?

28:27.700 --> 28:31.100
It could spur on the virus and
the rapid development of the entity.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.200
But it's still seeking heat. Why?

28:33.200 --> 28:36.400
What if it's still developing?

28:36.900 --> 28:41.300
You're not under the impression what we're
looking for makes sense in any conventional way?

28:42.400 --> 28:43.900
No.

28:51.600 --> 28:55.500
You're going to be fine, Gibson.
You're going to be okay.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.500
Let's get a bed ready.

29:01.700 --> 29:04.300
You're going to run more tests.

29:04.300 --> 29:07.800
- We're going to get you well.
- You say that, but you're going to run more tests...

29:07.800 --> 29:09.900
...just like the other doctors.

29:09.900 --> 29:13.800
- We have to run some more tests, Gibson.
- You want to make me well...

29:13.800 --> 29:18.300
...but you're just thinking about
yourself and what you can learn from me.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.500
You're a very special boy, Gibson.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.100
You know that yourself.

29:32.100 --> 29:35.400
I'm a very special lab rat.

30:32.800 --> 30:38.100
According to what little we could
gather the victim's body was found near here.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.500
It's hot in here.

30:40.500 --> 30:45.900
We're right above the core reactor. This
is part of the heat transfer cooling system.

30:56.800 --> 31:00.800
- Looks organic.
- Maybe somebody's got the flu.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.500
What? What is it?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.100
There's something in there.

32:30.300 --> 32:31.900
Yeah.

32:31.900 --> 32:35.100
Mulder, I found something. I found
something you're not going to believe.

32:35.100 --> 32:36.300
Ditto.

32:36.300 --> 32:42.000
We did blood tests on Gibson and, Mulder,
there's evidence of the virus in his system.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
The same virus you were exposed to?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.800
- I'm almost positive.
- What does that mean, Scully?

32:46.800 --> 32:53.000
I don't know... I don't know, but I think we're on
to something. We're on to something huge-- a link.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.800
- I'll call that bet and raise you.
- What?

32:55.800 --> 32:58.600
Never mind. Just
take care of Gibson.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.900
There was a little boy
in that room and he's gone.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.300
Does anybody know what
happened to that little boy?

33:30.600 --> 33:34.400
His name is Gibson Praise.
He was just in that room.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.200
Does anybody know what
the hell is going on?!

33:38.200 --> 33:41.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's just calm down.

33:41.100 --> 33:43.500
That little boy that I brought in is missing.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.800
He can't be missing.
He should still be in his bed.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.800
He's not here!

35:38.100 --> 35:41.300
- It's here.
- Where?

35:43.600 --> 35:45.900
Somewhere.

36:18.100 --> 36:20.600
Open the door, you son of a bitch!

36:21.000 --> 36:22.600
Open the door!

36:22.600 --> 36:24.600
Open it! Open it!

36:25.500 --> 36:27.500
- Open the door, you...
- Fox!

36:28.100 --> 36:31.500
I'm going to go see if
there's some other way in.

36:31.900 --> 36:35.400
Open it!
Open the door!

36:37.700 --> 36:40.400
I told you it was here.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.500
Gibson!

36:52.700 --> 36:54.600
Gibson!

36:55.700 --> 36:57.100
Gibson!

37:01.200 --> 37:02.800
There he is!

37:26.400 --> 37:32.800
As I said and as I am forced to reiterate,
Agent Mulder, the FBI is not here for vendettas...

37:32.800 --> 37:35.700
...or for the grinding of personal axes.

37:35.700 --> 37:39.600
Now, this holds not just for
you but for everyone at the Bureau.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.800
You force us to put a point on this.
To make some hard changes.

37:44.800 --> 37:50.000
You and Agent Scully will cease all
material association with the X-Files.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.600
Refusal to do so will end
in immediate dismissal.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.800
A probationary period will be set.

37:56.800 --> 38:01.100
You will now report to
Assistant Director Kersh.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.300
You're not supposed to come here.

38:16.500 --> 38:19.300
It's what was agreed to.

38:19.900 --> 38:23.000
- It's the deal you made.
- I had to congratulate you.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.900
Commend how you handled things.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.000
How you handled Mulder.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.600
I did what I was asked.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.200
You did well, son.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.800
He's on very thin ice now, you know?

38:42.800 --> 38:44.700
Mulder will be back.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.600
As long as he lives, he won't give up.

38:47.600 --> 38:50.100
Well, there's solutions, of course.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.100
Simple but extreme solutions.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.700
I've used these methods.
They have their place.

39:00.300 --> 39:02.700
But not here.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.400
You've killed men?

39:08.300 --> 39:11.900
You can kill a man...

39:11.900 --> 39:14.900
...but you can't kill what he stands for.

39:16.600 --> 39:20.100
Not unless you first break his spirit.

39:22.900 --> 39:26.000
That's a beautiful thing to see.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.100
It would help if you'd shut the door.
It would make it harder for them to see...

39:46.100 --> 39:49.400
...that I'm totally disregarding
everything I was told.

39:54.500 --> 39:57.600
Everything We were told, Mulder.

39:59.600 --> 40:03.400
They can't take away the X-Files,
Scully. They tried.

40:03.600 --> 40:09.500
You know, Agent Fowley's report to OPR
painted the facts in an interesting way.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.100
I hope you haven't been betrayed.

40:11.100 --> 40:17.600
Agent Fowley's report was a means to an end.
Trying to protect the work. Protect the X-Files.

40:17.600 --> 40:23.800
Mulder, Agent Fowley's report states that the man you
saw attacked was bludgeoned by an unknown subject.

40:23.800 --> 40:27.700
She makes no mention of a little boy
who as it happens, is nowhere to be found.

40:27.700 --> 40:31.500
It would seem that her report
protects everything but you.

40:31.900 --> 40:35.800
Agent Fowley took me to that
plant at great risk to herself...

40:35.800 --> 40:39.800
...where I saw something that you
refuse to believe in. Saw it again, Scully.

40:39.800 --> 40:44.400
And though it may not say it in her report,
Diana saw it, too. And no matter what you think...

40:44.400 --> 40:49.400
...she's certainly not going to go around saying that
just because science can't prove it isn't true.

40:50.300 --> 40:56.000
I don't doubt what you saw, Mulder.
I don't doubt you.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.800
I'm willing to believe, but not in a lie
and not in the opposite of what I can prove.

41:05.200 --> 41:08.800
It comes down to a matter of trust.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.800
I guess it always has.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.800
You asking me to make a choice?

41:20.800 --> 41:24.300
I'm asking you to trust my judgment.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.300
To trust me.

41:33.700 --> 41:37.100
I can't accept that. Not if it
refutes what I know to be true.

41:37.100 --> 41:42.500
Mulder, these are test results.
DNA from the claw nail we found...

41:42.500 --> 41:48.400
...matching exactly the DNA from the
virus you believe is extraterrestrial.

41:49.700 --> 41:52.200
That's the connection.

41:52.200 --> 41:57.700
Which matches exactly DNA that
was found in Gibson Praise.

41:59.100 --> 42:03.700
Wait a minute. I don't understand. You're saying
that Gibson Praise is infected with the virus?

42:03.700 --> 42:09.000
No. It's a part of his DNA.
In fact, it's a part of all of our DNA.

42:09.000 --> 42:16.500
It's called a genetic remnant. It's inactive
junk DNA. Except in Gibson it's turned on.

42:18.200 --> 42:23.700
So if that were true, that would mean
that Gibson is in some part extraterrestrial.

42:24.100 --> 42:27.700
It would mean that all of us are.
