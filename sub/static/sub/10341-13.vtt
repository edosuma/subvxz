WEBVTT

01:34.135 --> 01:37.137
Cooper.

01:48.191 --> 01:54.113
I remember stepping from the flames,
a vague shape in the dark,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.323
then nothing.

01:56.491 --> 02:01.078
Until I found myself standing
by the cold remains of our campfire

02:01.246 --> 02:02.663
two days later.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.124
Major, there are
some new techniques

02:05.291 --> 02:08.335
that might help us break through
your amnesia.

02:08.503 --> 02:12.131
My memories are immune
from regression.

02:12.549 --> 02:18.762
I can feel them, they are palpable,
the smells and the sensation.

02:19.097 --> 02:23.767
Everything is known to me,
yet somehow beyond my reach.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.061
Do you remember anything else?

02:26.229 --> 02:27.646
Very little.

02:27.814 --> 02:33.068
Save for one disturbing image
of a giant owl.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.611
- Pervasive.
- A giant owl?

02:40.827 --> 02:43.954
A giant owl? How big?

02:44.622 --> 02:47.749
Enough to cloud my mind
and memory.

02:48.418 --> 02:53.297
Three triangular scars behind
the right ear in perfect proportion.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.132
Major Briggs,

02:55.300 --> 02:59.678
exactly what does
your work involve?

02:59.846 --> 03:02.431
That information's,

03:03.057 --> 03:06.393
as I've repeated endlessly
to myself,

03:06.811 --> 03:08.812
classified.

03:11.608 --> 03:16.945
Though the keeping of secrets
seems less meaningful to me now.

03:21.451 --> 03:27.372
Perhaps there are sources
of information that are so important

03:27.874 --> 03:31.543
as to transcend the human need
to conspire.

03:31.711 --> 03:35.797
Information of such weight,
that pertains not...

03:39.010 --> 03:41.136
Oh, God.

03:42.013 --> 03:45.140
Is this meant for the soul?

03:46.684 --> 03:48.060
My soul?

03:51.940 --> 03:56.276
Major, perhaps you'd better
start back at the beginning.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.949
Are you familiar
with Project Blue Book?

04:02.492 --> 04:04.409
Yes, sir, I am.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.703
The Air Force investigation
into the phenomena

04:06.871 --> 04:09.039
of unidentified flying objects.

04:09.207 --> 04:12.084
Officially disbanded in 1969.

04:13.211 --> 04:16.672
But there are those of us

04:17.340 --> 04:20.676
who continue,
in an unofficial capacity,

04:20.843 --> 04:24.263
examining the heavens as before.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.891
In the case of Twin Peaks,
the earth below.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.147
We are searching for a place
called the White Lodge.

04:37.193 --> 04:40.487
- Major Briggs?
- I've been expecting you.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.782
- Hold on just a minute, fellows.
- Colonel Riley's orders.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.701
I don't care what orders you've got,

04:45.868 --> 04:48.412
this is my station and Major Briggs
happens to be a friend of...

04:48.579 --> 04:50.122
Harry.

04:52.375 --> 04:56.670
I'm afraid we will have to continue
this discussion at a later date.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.797
Are you sure
you wanna go with them?

04:58.965 --> 05:00.465
Yeah.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.302
- Goodbye.
- Major.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.757
Oh, go ahead, Ernie, it won't bite.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.467
A lot you know, pal.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.261
These men are dangerous thugs,

05:46.429 --> 05:49.348
not that I haven't met
plenty of their kind before.

05:49.515 --> 05:50.849
Jean Renault is a hard man,

05:51.017 --> 05:52.976
but I've known men
that would make him quiver.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.519
Ernie, come on.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.355
Make the call.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.483
Well, have we set the buy yet?

05:59.650 --> 06:03.153
Trying to.
Ernie's a wee bit gun-shy.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.780
Gun-shy?

06:04.947 --> 06:07.741
Ernie Niles is as bold as can be.
Let me at him.

06:13.247 --> 06:15.916
Please, don't make me do this.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.418
This is suicide, I know.
Please, I'm begging you, please.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.128
For everybody's sake, please.

06:20.296 --> 06:23.048
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.845
Hello.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.724
May I speak to Jean Renault,
please?

06:36.646 --> 06:39.898
Hi, Jean. Yeah, I've got
that big out-of-town buy here.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.862
Hi, Lucy.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.656
Oh.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.417
Where have you been, Andrew?

06:58.584 --> 07:00.961
There was a cat in a tree.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.213
A peace officer's work
is never done.

07:03.381 --> 07:07.175
But fortunately for us, my efforts
have borne more palatable fruit.

07:07.343 --> 07:10.554
I paid the Happy Helping Hand
adoption agency a visit,

07:10.721 --> 07:13.557
where several blue-haired ladies
were only too happy to sup

07:13.724 --> 07:15.475
from my open palm.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.812
Unfortunately,
little Nicky's records have been sealed

07:18.980 --> 07:20.605
and returned to the orphanage.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.358
We'll never know what really happened
to little Nicky's parents.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.194
Courage, Andrew.
Do not despair, dear boy.

07:26.362 --> 07:29.322
Next stop,
that selfsame orphanage.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.241
And little Nicky's records within.

07:31.451 --> 07:35.120
- Maybe we should tell Lucy.
- Absolutely not.

07:36.038 --> 07:39.708
This, dear boy,
is strictly a man's job.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.960
Follow me.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.969
- Lucy.
- Hi.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.804
Any luck?

07:52.972 --> 07:57.017
I checked the personals columns
in every national newspaper on the list,

07:57.185 --> 08:00.187
and I didn't see anything
that looked like a chess deal

08:00.354 --> 08:03.440
or find any mention
of the name Windom Earle.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.358
I'm sorry.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.444
It's okay.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.081
More coffee?

08:22.293 --> 08:24.252
You bet.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.011
Is everything all right, Ed?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.389
Couldn't be better.

08:40.811 --> 08:41.895
This is for you.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.245
Bye for now.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.247
Bye-bye.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.588
Come on, Leo.

09:08.756 --> 09:09.881
That's a good Leo.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.844
Each day brings a new beginning.

09:15.012 --> 09:19.266
And every hour, the promise of...

09:19.433 --> 09:21.476
It was your turn to feed him, Bobby!

09:21.644 --> 09:23.812
I got practice.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.273
Football season is over.

09:26.440 --> 09:30.360
Baseball.
Our national pastime?

09:30.528 --> 09:34.489
Fine. You can clean
when you get back.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.577
I ain't coming back.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.579
What?

09:41.372 --> 09:44.499
You're looking
at Ben Horne's brand-new boy.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.836
Do the words "golden opportunity"
mean anything to you?

09:48.004 --> 09:50.213
This is my big break, Shelly.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.090
You don't think
I have anything better to do

09:52.258 --> 09:53.758
than give Leo Johnson
a bubble bath?

09:53.926 --> 09:55.260
And what about me, Bobby?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.388
Do I not have anything better to do?

09:59.098 --> 10:01.516
Not that I can think of.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.314
Bobby.

10:07.940 --> 10:11.568
Bobby!

10:20.911 --> 10:22.829
God!

10:39.388 --> 10:40.889
Big Ed's Gas Farm.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.349
- Uncle Ed?
- James?

10:42.516 --> 10:45.226
- Yeah, it's me.
- Where are you? Are you all right?

10:45.394 --> 10:47.228
Oh, I'm okay.

10:47.396 --> 10:50.231
Uh, look, I need a favor.

10:50.399 --> 10:54.027
Um, I need you to get all the money
out of my savings account.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.779
That's only $12, James.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.781
Well, whatever's left.

10:57.948 --> 11:02.202
And send it care of me to Wallies.
It's this bar out on 96.

11:02.912 --> 11:03.953
Are you in trouble?

11:04.121 --> 11:06.706
Um, no, I really can't talk about it.

11:06.874 --> 11:09.584
- James...
- Listen, I really can't talk right now.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.836
- Okay.
- We'll talk about it soon.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.254
- Take care.
- Yeah.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.091
- Call soon.
- Okay, bye.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.135
- Long-distance?
- Twin Peaks.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.179
Are you homesick, James?

11:22.431 --> 11:23.682
No. Heh.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.851
Tell me about Twin Peaks.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.397
There's nothing to say.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.317
You could start with why you left.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.695
It was a woman, as I recall.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.614
No, you said it was a few of them.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.284
I loved a girl who died.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.328
Her name was Laura.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.500
And I thought I knew her,
but I didn't.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.878
I guess nobody did.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.797
I'm sorry.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.593
My life used to make sense,
you know?

12:01.679 --> 12:04.514
I didn't like it all the time,
but it was mine.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.934
And I felt like it belonged to me.

12:10.688 --> 12:14.649
And then Laura died.

12:16.318 --> 12:19.779
And now I belong to something else.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.283
To Laura.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.958
And no matter what I did,

12:32.126 --> 12:35.211
or how much I tried to help...

12:38.632 --> 12:41.217
...another girl got murdered.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.015
I just wanted to get on my bike
and ride away.

12:47.808 --> 12:52.562
Take off, just go as far from
Twin Peaks as the thing will take me.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.232
I know the feeling, James.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.573
I know the feeling.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.965
Why do you let him hurt you?

13:28.349 --> 13:29.974
Jeffrey's leaving.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.602
I need you. Will you help me?

13:32.770 --> 13:35.438
- Mr. Marsh.
- What do you mean?

13:35.606 --> 13:39.192
- I need your help.
- I'll put the bags in for you.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.153
Very good, sir.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.791
- Good morning, Mike Nelson.
- Oh, Lord.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.710
You wanna share a soda?

13:57.878 --> 14:02.715
How about a nice big piece
of cherry pie? Two forks.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.635
Mrs. Hurley, Nadine,
I want my own piece of cherry pie.

14:05.803 --> 14:10.139
In fact, I want two pieces
of cherry pie, by myself.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.560
Okay. Meat loaf.

14:13.727 --> 14:17.689
No. Cherry pie and coffee.
In fact, I want 16 cups of coffee.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.566
I don't wanna talk with you,
walk with you.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.526
I don't wanna see you,
I don't wanna know you.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.069
Is that clear enough to understand?

14:23.237 --> 14:27.323
Or do I need a court order
to get my point across?

14:31.245 --> 14:32.829
Mike Nelson,

14:32.997 --> 14:37.500
you are the handsomest boy
I've ever known.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.879
And I would really like it

14:41.046 --> 14:45.717
if you and I could go out on a date.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.399
I'm sorry.

15:01.567 --> 15:05.403
Sometimes I can't help myself.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.340
Hey, Norma. Where are you going?

15:26.550 --> 15:28.801
Oh, I have to run some errands.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.762
It's a little early for errands, isn't it?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.680
We've still got most
of the breakfast crowd.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.142
Just you and a kitchen full
of scrambled eggs.

15:36.810 --> 15:37.977
I'll be right back.

15:39.521 --> 15:42.148
Just think of it as a test, Hank.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.115
I'll do that.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.559
I thought you were moving
into my place.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.478
- I'm sorry.
- What happened?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.397
What the hell are you doing here?

16:22.564 --> 16:24.691
- This is my home.
- Home?

16:24.858 --> 16:27.944
After everything Catherine
has done to you?

16:28.779 --> 16:31.072
I have no choice.

16:31.740 --> 16:37.996
Josie.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.837
- Oh, go home.
- Josie, let me take care of you.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.881
- No.
- Please.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.051
Listen, I'm safe here.
And when I'm here,

16:52.219 --> 16:54.679
- you're safe too.
- No.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.688
Stop.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.107
Look at me.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.151
I'm Catherine's maid.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.987
I'm no good for you.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.991
You are good for me.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.620
I love you.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.208
I want you.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.788
Lucille...

18:04.541 --> 18:06.375
What?

18:07.377 --> 18:08.920
What's wrong?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.713
Yes, sir, general.

18:10.881 --> 18:15.468
I want you to lead the charge
on Little Round Top.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.178
Yes, sir.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.472
Yes, sir!

18:19.640 --> 18:23.101
And where is General Stuart?
And his cavalry?

18:23.268 --> 18:26.312
He's a-coming, sir.
Damn his eyes.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.731
- He's coming, sir. I know it!
- Daddy.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.942
- He's coming. He had better be.
- Daddy.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.194
For all our sakes.

18:33.362 --> 18:37.573
Because the enemy,
we meet the enemy here.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.743
We meet him before morning.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.496
- We meet him here.
- Daddy.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.584
Yes, darling?

18:49.795 --> 18:52.088
What are you doing?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.967
There's a war going on, darling.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.718
A war?

18:57.886 --> 19:00.471
A war between the states.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.810
Daddy, I think you need some help.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.021
No, no, I'm all right, darling.

19:09.606 --> 19:14.694
I just need a little time.
This is a very important day.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.654
Yes, Daddy,
this is a very important day.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.531
We're gonna save the business.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.950
- You and I.
- Darling, darling.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.743
Yes, Daddy?

19:22.911 --> 19:25.538
You are standing on General Stuart.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.419
General Lee!

19:31.962 --> 19:36.257
General Lee! Yes, sir.
Old Jeb, he's come.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.969
Oh, I don't need any more wagons!

19:40.137 --> 19:43.639
I want my eyes
and my ears beside me.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.474
- Get me General Stuart.
- This is Audrey.

19:45.642 --> 19:48.060
- I need you to get me Jerry Horne.
- Bring me General Norton.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.563
- Ready the men of the Alabama 15th.
- This is an emergency.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.945
- I've been figuring that we have to...
- I think we need to talk about what...

20:00.324 --> 20:02.158
Come on in.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.498
You first.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.876
Okay.

20:13.170 --> 20:16.589
You're the last thing I think of
when I go to sleep at night.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.633
And you're the first thought
on my mind

20:18.800 --> 20:20.760
when I get up in the morning.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.013
I know this world is going to pieces,

20:24.181 --> 20:27.516
and it feels like it's designed
to keep us apart.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.437
But we love each other, Ed.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.524
I wanna be with you.

20:35.984 --> 20:39.028
I wanna be with you
no matter what happens.

20:48.247 --> 20:52.208
Ed. Ed, Ed. Your turn.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.252
Later.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.099
Ouch! Will you mind the chest hair,
will you?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.184
You're sweating like a pig, Mr. Niles.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.187
Oh, thanks a lot. Huh?

21:13.355 --> 21:17.191
That's nervous perspiration, man.
Hyperhidrosis.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.609
It's a childhood condition.

21:18.777 --> 21:22.947
I didn't notice it till the war.
Korea, remember that year?

21:23.115 --> 21:25.908
I was leading a battalion
up towards the 49th parallel.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.411
We were just a bunch
of fresh-faced kids.

21:28.578 --> 21:30.830
I didn't know what kind of hell
we were stepping into.

21:30.998 --> 21:35.251
Ernie. Ernie, I want you to focus
on the here and now.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.712
Repeat your instructions to me
step by step.

21:37.879 --> 21:40.840
Okay. Uh...

21:41.341 --> 21:46.804
I take Denise up to Dead Dog Farm.

21:47.014 --> 21:50.599
- I introduce her to Renault.
- Right.

21:51.143 --> 21:55.229
I, uh, take Renault through the buy,

21:55.397 --> 21:57.606
complete the transaction
and get the hell out of there.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.736
Good. Harry?
That's when you come in.

22:03.488 --> 22:07.199
By golly, I sure wish
I could join you fellas.

22:07.367 --> 22:09.702
But I've temporarily lost
my enforcement franchise.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.871
- I'll bet.
- Well,

22:12.039 --> 22:13.956
I've been giving that
some thought.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.418
Consider yourself deputized.

22:18.378 --> 22:21.213
The Bureau's loss is my gain.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.592
I hope I can live up to this.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.888
He's done. You might wanna
towel him off before we go.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.140
Come on.

22:32.267 --> 22:36.103
Uh, how long will it, uh,
take you guys

22:36.271 --> 22:40.024
to storm the farmhouse after, uh,
I complete the buy?

22:40.192 --> 22:42.193
You go out, we come in.

22:42.402 --> 22:45.446
- Can I ask you a question?
- What, Ernie?

22:45.655 --> 22:47.740
Don't make me do this.
This isn't my line of work.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.534
I'm a coward. I don't do
this kind of thing, I'm a CPA.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.411
- Ernie.
- Ernie.

22:52.913 --> 22:56.749
Heh. Just a momentary lapse.
Look, I'm cool.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.167
Let's go do it, huh?

22:59.252 --> 23:02.588
- Where's Denise?
- I haven't seen her.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.966
You can call me Dennis.

23:06.760 --> 23:10.679
Oh, I don't know,
somehow it seemed more appropriate.

23:14.601 --> 23:15.935
- What do you think?
- Whew.

23:23.068 --> 23:26.570
Our investigation
must proceed sub rosa.

23:29.116 --> 23:33.077
We may have to pick the lock.
Tricky business.

23:35.872 --> 23:38.791
Voilà. We enter.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.420
- Where is everybody?
- Lunch.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.422
Here we are, the case files.

23:44.589 --> 23:47.675
N, N.

23:47.843 --> 23:50.803
N, N!

23:53.056 --> 23:58.936
Nails, Neaster,
Neatherby, Needleman.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.897
Nicholas Needleman,
our little Nicky.

24:02.065 --> 24:04.650
- We can read it in the car.
- Patience, Andrew.

24:04.818 --> 24:08.404
- Dick.
- The usual background information.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.449
Hmm. Birthplace,

24:11.992 --> 24:14.410
initial adoption.

24:14.911 --> 24:17.955
Hmm. First of several, it seems.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.957
Dick.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.085
Ah, the plot thickens.

24:25.213 --> 24:27.840
Where are thy secrets, little Nicky?

24:28.008 --> 24:29.967
Dick.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.598
Hi.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.813
We're the Brunstons.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.149
Heh, I know we're a little early.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.401
It's just that we're so darn eager
to see him.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.029
Can we see him? Where is Donnie?

24:50.197 --> 24:54.575
Uh, little Donnie is... dead.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.914
Ah! Dead tired, I mean.

25:00.499 --> 25:04.835
I'm afraid little Donnie,
he isn't feeling up to snuff.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.838
Well, he was in perfect health
only yesterday.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.842
- Dick.
- Just a minute.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.930
Woody, let me finish helping
these good people.

25:16.097 --> 25:19.725
Now, where were we?

25:20.769 --> 25:23.812
Ed. Ed, it's Donna.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.859
- I need your help, Ed.
- What can I do for you, honey?

25:29.027 --> 25:30.402
Well, I've been looking for James.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.947
He hasn't been in school,
no one's seen him at the diner.

25:33.114 --> 25:35.199
I even went by his house,
but I can't find him.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.660
Listen, James is fine. He called.

25:37.827 --> 25:42.039
He asked me to send him some money
in care of a bar out on 96.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.375
We didn't talk long.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.753
- It's all I know.
- I'll take it to him.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.421
Well, what about your folks?

25:49.589 --> 25:51.924
I'll explain, they'll understand.

25:52.092 --> 25:55.678
- Okay.
- Thanks, Ed.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.228
I have to get going.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.397
I'll call.

26:06.606 --> 26:09.441
- We have a lot to talk about.
- Yeah.

26:10.151 --> 26:12.236
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:19.202 --> 26:22.955
Oh, Ed. The things we do for love.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.217
Eddie, I'm home. Ugh!

26:36.428 --> 26:39.138
Eddie! Look out!

26:58.658 --> 27:01.952
You big bully!

27:09.502 --> 27:11.378
Eddie?

27:12.839 --> 27:15.049
Can you hear me?

27:16.009 --> 27:19.219
- Nadine?
- Yeah, Nadine's here.

27:20.930 --> 27:23.182
Don't you worry about a thing, baby.

27:23.350 --> 27:26.101
Nadine will take care of everything.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.561
Oh.

27:35.111 --> 27:38.405
Colonel Chamberlain
and the 20th Maine

27:38.573 --> 27:42.826
were trapped at the summit
of Little Round Top.

27:42.994 --> 27:46.163
Now, his only chance

27:46.331 --> 27:49.958
is to maneuver his left flank

27:50.126 --> 27:53.337
down the hillside
like a swinging gate.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.047
But we were waiting for him, Bobby.

27:56.549 --> 28:02.388
And Chamberlain's desperate
maneuver ended, Bobby, in failure.

28:02.555 --> 28:06.141
- Mr. Horne...
- Little Round Top, Bobby, was ours.

28:06.351 --> 28:11.188
From that vantage point, we were able
to roll back the Federal lines.

28:11.356 --> 28:15.609
Setting the stage
for Pickett's mighty charge, Bobby.

28:16.319 --> 28:19.321
And victory!

28:24.411 --> 28:26.829
Victory. Hurray.

28:37.590 --> 28:39.425
General Meade,

28:40.176 --> 28:45.305
you have suffered an ignoble defeat.

28:45.682 --> 28:50.686
And I accept
your unconditional surrender.

28:52.731 --> 28:56.358
Okay, tell you what, Mr. Horne.

28:56.526 --> 29:00.529
I'm gonna go and talk
to President Lincoln first, okay?

29:00.739 --> 29:04.074
So you just wait right here and...

29:07.579 --> 29:11.248
And, uh, I'll get back to you
on this whole surrender thing.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.916
Okay? Gotta go.

29:14.961 --> 29:18.630
Don't, uh, wanna keep
the president waiting.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.508
Sir!

29:24.429 --> 29:28.974
Baby, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

29:29.476 --> 29:33.520
The bad news is that your old man
just bought a condo in Flip City.

29:33.688 --> 29:36.857
The good news is that he's about
to win the Civil War.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.484
I know.

29:38.651 --> 29:41.612
Uncle Jerry said he was coming home
on the next plane.

29:41.780 --> 29:45.282
Dr. Jacoby said
he would come over tomorrow.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.327
I think Daddy needs an injection.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.329
God, we gotta help him.

29:50.497 --> 29:53.040
Don't worry, baby,
Bobby's on the case.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.501
Don't call me baby.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.851
Enter lively.

30:15.271 --> 30:17.439
Catherine.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.197
Hello, Ben.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.661
You've come here to gloat,
haven't you? Huh?

30:31.621 --> 30:34.998
To, uh, celebrate my demise.

30:36.835 --> 30:40.170
Well, you go ahead. You laugh.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.966
You defeated me,

30:45.134 --> 30:48.011
as I have defeated General Meade.

30:49.305 --> 30:51.223
It's true.

30:52.058 --> 30:54.726
I did come here to gloat.

30:58.606 --> 31:01.191
You double-crossed me.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.110
You tried to kill me.

31:03.653 --> 31:08.198
And I wanted to bury you so deeply

31:08.366 --> 31:13.161
that future generations would unearth
and exhibit your remains.

31:13.329 --> 31:16.874
Slimy rat bastard Americanus.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.376
Do not feed.

31:23.631 --> 31:26.008
Do not trust.

31:28.386 --> 31:31.096
I suppose that, uh...

31:33.850 --> 31:36.476
hat I'm not that trustworthy.

31:43.484 --> 31:48.113
Despite everything
I know about you,

31:49.073 --> 31:52.743
I find myself here with you.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.913
Wanting you.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.207
You can't be serious.

32:03.379 --> 32:05.923
I want you, Ben.

32:07.258 --> 32:11.845
Horrifying as it seems,
I can't escape it.

32:14.098 --> 32:15.265
You, uh...

32:17.310 --> 32:20.938
You make my body hum.

32:25.234 --> 32:28.528
Kiss me, General Lee.

32:45.546 --> 32:48.924
On to victory!

32:49.425 --> 32:53.345
Hurry up, Jim.
The champagne's getting warm.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.055
Don't call me Jim.

32:56.766 --> 33:00.519
All right, all right, all right.

33:02.730 --> 33:06.024
- James, what?
- You may look.

33:08.695 --> 33:09.987
Any place you wanna go?

33:11.698 --> 33:14.408
Jeffrey will be home by midnight.

33:14.575 --> 33:16.410
Doesn't leave us a lot of time.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.081
Well, I'll take what we can get.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.333
It's a deal.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.345
To handsome strangers.

33:35.513 --> 33:36.888
And rebuilt engines.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.021
You know, I never thought
I'd see it drive again.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.939
You're a miracle worker.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.399
No, honest.

33:49.652 --> 33:51.028
You're being too modest.

33:51.946 --> 33:54.489
Oh, go on. You deserve it.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.533
You're strong and you're kind.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.661
You have a wonderfully honest face,
James.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.331
Don't laugh, it's quite rare.

34:04.208 --> 34:07.461
Every time I look at you,
I could tell exactly what you're thinking.

34:07.670 --> 34:11.339
Well, I'd better be careful
about what I'm thinking.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.883
Don't be too careful.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.469
Not on my account.

34:17.805 --> 34:20.265
So, what are your plans?

34:20.683 --> 34:22.642
I don't really have any plans.

34:22.810 --> 34:25.020
Where will you go?

34:25.188 --> 34:27.105
I don't know.

34:28.024 --> 34:31.568
- James, don't.
- What?

34:31.736 --> 34:34.029
I don't want you to leave.

34:34.530 --> 34:37.157
Give me some more time, James.

34:37.533 --> 34:40.786
I can think of a hundred reasons
for you to stay.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.886
You sure you don't wanna wait
for Hank?

35:40.054 --> 35:42.389
He told me this morning
he wanted in on all of this.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.058
- I think we should wait...
- We'll start without him.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.144
Whatever you say.

35:49.939 --> 35:53.066
You're sweating. Is something wrong?

35:53.234 --> 35:55.902
Sweaty. You know, it's hyperhidrosis.

35:56.070 --> 35:57.654
It's a childhood condition.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.865
I was living in Guam at the time.

36:00.032 --> 36:01.491
I contracted yellow fever.

36:01.659 --> 36:04.161
The effects are vicious.

36:05.705 --> 36:08.999
You know, sweating is one
of the more socially unacceptable.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.335
Sit down, Ernie. Take a deep breath.

36:12.879 --> 36:16.214
- Socially unacceptable.
- Everything seems to be in order.

36:16.382 --> 36:18.800
Do you think we could hurry this up?
I got a plane to catch.

36:20.511 --> 36:23.930
Jean. Jean, take a look,
his shirt is smoking.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.102
The wire's dead.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.229
Cooper!

36:32.231 --> 36:33.523
Hawk.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.984
- Cooper!
- Coop.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.613
He came for me, Harry.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.115
I want safe passage to the border.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.159
First, release the hostages.

36:44.327 --> 36:47.370
We're at cross-purposes, Cooper.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.289
We'll kill you if you don't.

36:49.832 --> 36:51.458
Then everybody dies.

36:52.043 --> 36:55.045
No, we'll trade.

36:57.131 --> 36:58.381
Trade?

36:59.133 --> 37:01.843
Ernie Niles
and agent Bryson for me.

37:02.428 --> 37:03.511
Coop.

37:13.272 --> 37:15.315
- I want backup.
- State police?

37:15.524 --> 37:17.234
Call them in.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.489
Lucy, it's Hawk.

37:22.698 --> 37:25.575
Patch me through
to the state police.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.489
How's our baby boy?

38:04.657 --> 38:06.533
Sound asleep.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.994
Dreaming of love.

38:15.876 --> 38:20.171
Lucky, lucky, lucky boy.

38:22.550 --> 38:27.220
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.734
They moved him to the center room.

38:40.901 --> 38:42.986
Andy, keep steady.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.865
More deputies.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.951
Sharpshooters.

38:51.912 --> 38:53.496
Let's deal or let's run.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.962
Will they let us run, Agent Cooper?

39:03.215 --> 39:04.716
No.

39:04.884 --> 39:08.511
So you think they will deal?

39:10.348 --> 39:11.598
No.

39:11.766 --> 39:14.351
What do you suggest we do?

39:14.769 --> 39:16.936
Surrender.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.400
Okay.

39:23.402 --> 39:25.487
Are you crazy?

39:25.654 --> 39:26.988
No.

39:27.156 --> 39:32.786
But first, we must decide
to give up quietly or to kill him.

39:35.122 --> 39:38.333
- Then we both die.
- I know.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.878
Is my death so important to you?

39:43.506 --> 39:45.673
My two brothers died.

39:45.841 --> 39:47.801
I hold you responsible.

39:49.512 --> 39:50.804
Why?

39:59.980 --> 40:02.607
Before you came here,

40:02.775 --> 40:05.902
Twin Peaks was a simple place.

40:06.529 --> 40:11.282
My brothers deal dope
to the teenagers and the truck drivers.

40:11.450 --> 40:14.369
One-Eyed Jack's welcomed
the businessmen and the tourists.

40:14.537 --> 40:17.831
Quiet people lived a quiet life.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.835
Then, a pretty girl die,

40:23.087 --> 40:27.132
and you arrive,
and everything change.

40:27.299 --> 40:29.259
My brother Bernard,

40:29.427 --> 40:34.681
shot and left to die in the woods.

40:35.015 --> 40:39.018
A grieving father smother
my remaining brother with a pillow.

40:39.186 --> 40:42.564
Kidnapping. Death.

40:42.815 --> 40:48.153
Suddenly, the quiet people,
they're quiet no more.

40:48.320 --> 40:54.868
Suddenly, the simple dream
become the nightmare.

40:55.035 --> 41:00.915
So if you die,
maybe you will be the last to die.

41:01.083 --> 41:06.171
Maybe you brought
the nightmare with you.

41:06.338 --> 41:09.340
And maybe the nightmare

41:09.508 --> 41:13.261
will die with you.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.765
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

41:18.684 --> 41:23.271
But I do know
we've got a damn problem here.

41:23.439 --> 41:27.066
And if you're not gonna solve it,
I will.

41:29.195 --> 41:30.445
- Jean.
- What?

41:30.613 --> 41:31.863
Take a look at this.

41:32.281 --> 41:35.366
- You order any food?
- No.

41:35.659 --> 41:38.077
No, no, no, let her come.

41:38.245 --> 41:39.537
Let her come.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.289
It's just a girl.

41:55.846 --> 41:58.640
- Hello.
- Suppertime.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.693
Don't I know you?

42:39.974 --> 42:41.724
Are you okay?

42:41.892 --> 42:43.685
Yeah.

42:43.852 --> 42:45.728
Quick thinking, Denise.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.272
It was just my legs.

42:47.856 --> 42:51.526
Thank Sheriff Truman.
It was his idea.

42:53.362 --> 42:55.613
Harry S. Truman.

42:55.781 --> 42:58.700
Sometimes you gotta improvise.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.910
He's dead.

43:19.972 --> 43:21.723
Bobby?

43:28.188 --> 43:30.273
Bobby?

43:52.963 --> 43:54.589
Bobby, this isn't funny.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.886
Bobby?

44:06.060 --> 44:08.061
Leo?

44:10.272 --> 44:12.482
Shelly.

44:18.447 --> 44:19.864
Bomb. What do you mean, bomb?

44:20.032 --> 44:23.201
- Start at the beginning.
- Well, the voice on the phone said

44:23.369 --> 44:25.578
that there was a bomb
planted in the woods,

44:25.746 --> 44:27.330
but it didn't say which woods.

44:27.498 --> 44:29.957
Then all of a sudden,
there was this huge explosion

44:30.125 --> 44:32.126
and all the lights went out.

44:32.294 --> 44:33.878
So then I called
the fire department.

44:34.046 --> 44:36.130
- Good work, Lucy.
- Was there a fire?

44:36.298 --> 44:39.050
Two of them. First there was one
at the power station.

44:39.218 --> 44:40.885
But most
of the volunteer fire department...

44:41.053 --> 44:43.554
I'm gonna go check on the generator.
Something's not right.

44:43.722 --> 44:45.556
Okay. So?

44:45.724 --> 44:48.434
- were playing bingo, so it took a while
to get everybody together.

44:48.602 --> 44:50.603
- Excuse me, Lucy.
- Then there was the explosion

44:50.771 --> 44:53.231
I told you about, which sounded
like it was right upstairs,

44:53.399 --> 44:56.067
so we all got out of here.
Well, it turned out to be a transformer

44:56.235 --> 44:58.152
on the pole right behind
and above the building.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.029
Well, we had to wait
to go back inside

45:00.197 --> 45:01.864
because it was shooting sparks
everywhere

45:02.032 --> 45:04.534
and we were afraid that the station
was gonna catch on fire too.

45:04.702 --> 45:05.743
But it didn't.

45:05.911 --> 45:07.286
Do they know how it started?

45:07.454 --> 45:09.997
Suspicious in nature,
that's what Chief Kipple said.

45:10.165 --> 45:12.208
He was suffering
from smoke inhalation at the time,

45:12.376 --> 45:14.335
so he sounded a little hoarse.

45:14.503 --> 45:15.962
You should hear his cough.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.131
I'm gonna make him
some chicken soup.

45:18.340 --> 45:21.259
- Harry?
- Yeah, Coop.

45:21.427 --> 45:24.554
You'd better take a look at this, alone.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.889
Lucy, wait here.

45:35.899 --> 45:37.191
Good Lord.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.446
Who is it?

45:41.613 --> 45:43.156
I don't know.

45:43.657 --> 45:46.033
It's a chess game.

45:46.535 --> 46:55.269
Windom Earle's next move.
