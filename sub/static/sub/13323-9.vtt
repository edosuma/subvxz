00:01.702 --> 00:02.470
- Next is a Bravo
original comedy.

00:04.538 --> 00:08.409
- A year ago, my life took
an unexpected turn.

00:08.442 --> 00:11.145
I lost everything
that mattered to me.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.681
I was shattered, so I started

00:13.714 --> 00:16.184
making handbags for my friends,

00:16.217 --> 00:18.619
just to get out of my own head,

00:18.652 --> 00:21.522
and it exploded.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.057
I look around now,

00:23.091 --> 00:26.660
and I feel so fortunate.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.297
- In less than one year,
Brooke von Weber

00:29.330 --> 00:31.765
has gone from budding
fashion entrepreneur,

00:31.799 --> 00:35.136
with her capsule collection
of luxurious accessories,

00:35.169 --> 00:37.071
to lifestyle empress.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.373
- This is my atelier.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.542
We had my husband's shaman come

00:41.575 --> 00:44.145
and burn sage
to cleanse the aura,

00:44.178 --> 00:46.414
and a feng shui specialist
who told me

00:46.447 --> 00:48.716
to move my drafting table
facing west,

00:48.749 --> 00:51.419
or my chi would be
out of balance.

00:51.452 --> 00:54.555
Our design studios
are covered in art.

00:54.588 --> 00:58.226
Larry Manassian personally
curated the spaces.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.162
I always say I have one person

01:01.195 --> 01:02.663
to thank for all of this:

01:02.696 --> 01:06.134
Joy Green, bestselling author of
"The Joy Manifesto."

01:06.167 --> 01:07.635
I to into that
in greater detail

01:07.668 --> 01:09.703
in my TED talk,
happening next month.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.605
- Brooke is doing a TED talk?

01:11.639 --> 01:13.541
- Yeah, should I get us tickets?

01:13.574 --> 01:15.276
- You're killing me, Ted.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.645
Who the hell is this "Ted"
person, anyway?

01:17.678 --> 01:18.646
[screams]

01:18.679 --> 01:20.248
[rock music]

01:20.281 --> 01:22.750
- * Hey, yes, you know

01:22.783 --> 01:26.187
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:26.220 --> 01:28.489
both: * Joshua fought
the battle of *

01:28.522 --> 01:30.358
* Jericho

01:30.391 --> 01:34.061
* Jericho, Jericho

01:34.162 --> 01:36.397
* Joshua fought the battle of

01:36.430 --> 01:40.301
* Jericho, and the walls came
a-tumbling down *

01:40.334 --> 01:41.835
- * Tumbling down

01:41.869 --> 01:46.407
- Waze says zero traffic
to Southampton.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.609
We are cruisin'!

01:48.642 --> 01:51.712
- Andy, do not anger
the traffic gods.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.747
- [sighs]
You and your superstitions.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.849
I am not afraid of you!

01:55.883 --> 01:57.718
- One more time!

01:57.751 --> 02:00.221
all: * Joshua fought
the battle of *

02:00.254 --> 02:01.855
* Jericho

- Welcome to Sea Spray.
Hi, Barbara. Oh.

02:13.234 --> 02:17.205
Welcome to my white party
celebrating the season.

02:17.205 --> 02:20.208
- Sorry to interrupt you guys,
but we just graduated

02:20.208 --> 02:22.210
from Harvard Business School
and we had to meet you.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.212
- HBS? That's awesome.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.514
This is my business partner,
Pete Wilson.

02:26.547 --> 02:29.483
He's too humble to admit it,
but this guy is the reason

02:29.517 --> 02:31.219
we had hockey-stick growth
this quarter.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.853
- Not true. Not true.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.256
- This is Ernie Krevitt.
- Hey.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.225
- Sharpest investor
on the continent.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.793
Remember this guy's name when
you make your first $10 mil.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.230
- Come on, you guys want a pic
with the Hercules heroes here?

02:42.230 --> 02:43.664
Let's go.
- You're twisting my arm.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.299
- Yeah, let's do it.
- This is good.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.868
- Great. Here we go.
- Yeah, actually...

02:47.901 --> 02:50.137
we meant her.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.640
No offense.
- Oh, really?

02:52.673 --> 02:55.476
- I did my Capstone project on
von Weber designs.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.645
I want to be you.
- Thank you.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.814
You two are adorable.
[sighs]

03:00.848 --> 03:03.484
- Sir, would you mind taking
a picture of us?

03:03.517 --> 03:04.918
- Of course.
- Great.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.887
- Yeah.
- Thank you. That's great.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.856
- Yeah, all right, uh,

03:08.889 --> 03:11.625
one, two, three.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.872
The "New York Times" piece is
the number-one most shared.

03:24.905 --> 03:28.175
- [gasps]
- 986 comments. 989.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.743
- I'm forwarding
to Simon Doonan,

03:29.777 --> 03:30.911
Roopal Patel, and Linda Fargo.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.313
- Oh, genius.
- Hon.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.414
My mother wants you to meet,
uh--

03:33.447 --> 03:34.782
- Jackie O's sister

03:34.815 --> 03:36.384
just started following me
on Twitter.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.918
- Lee Radziwill? Oh, my God!
both: No!

03:37.951 --> 03:39.720
[phone ringing]
- Oh, I'm getting a phone call.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.489
It's probably for business.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.391
This could be important,
so I'm gonna...

03:43.424 --> 03:45.559
- Marc Jacobs Tweeted.
- Yellow?

03:45.593 --> 03:48.762
- Lex Luthor!
- Andy-monium!

03:48.796 --> 03:49.897
You guys getting close?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.765
- T-minus 38 minutes.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.301
Hey, tell Brooke
"Congratulations"

03:53.334 --> 03:54.635
on that "Times" piece.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.538
- [chuckles] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.440
- The kids have already
watched it 10 times.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.809
- Yeah.
- Okay, see you soon.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.614
- Come on, I know you've got
a joke up your sleeve

04:06.647 --> 04:09.383
about Brooke and this "Times"
thing--let's go.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.951
Spit it out.
- No, no. Sorry.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.954
I was just getting another
sweet "Thank you" note

04:13.987 --> 04:15.689
from one of my doormen.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.758
I loved that project.

04:17.791 --> 04:21.329
[laughter]
- Uh-oh. Butt crack attack.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.697
- Oh, my God--Miles,
what are you--give me that!

04:23.731 --> 04:25.533
Oh, don't worry, it's not porn.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.801
It's just my--my doormen.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.504
- Jill, those are
your doorman shots?

04:30.538 --> 04:32.573
- Yeah, why?
You knew they were nude.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.675
- I guess when you said
they were nude, I didn't realize

04:34.708 --> 04:36.344
they wouldn't have
any clothes on.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.978
- Andy, you're such a hypocrite.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.647
You pride yourself
on knowing the names

04:39.680 --> 04:41.248
or all your mother's doormen,

04:41.349 --> 04:43.884
but do you really know anything
about who they are?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.619
- Maybe not, but
I don't think knowing

04:45.653 --> 04:48.656
Carlton bends to the left
is gonna get me there.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.491
- It's to the right.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.492
- [chuckles]

04:51.525 --> 04:54.495
[rock music]

04:54.528 --> 04:56.764
*

04:56.797 --> 04:59.800
So, I'm thinking maybe better
to not bring up

04:59.833 --> 05:02.470
your doorman project
at this party.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.971
I'm afraid it's the wrong crowd.

05:04.004 --> 05:07.408
- Wow, you're actually
embarrassed by me.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.510
- Am I not allowed to be
weirded out by the fact

05:09.543 --> 05:11.479
that all these doormen who say,
"Hey, Jill, how's it going,"

05:11.512 --> 05:14.582
have been naked
in our apartment?

05:14.615 --> 05:16.784
Did any of them sit
on the furniture?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.686
- [sighs]
How is it different

05:18.719 --> 05:21.755
from art students sketching
nude models in class?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.657
- Because that's art.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.793
- Excuse me?
- Okay, you know what I mean.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.296
You know--can we please
talk about this another time?

05:29.397 --> 05:31.532
- No, I think it's important
that the kids see

05:31.565 --> 05:33.767
that we fight and work it out.
- Okay.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.604
- Daddy is making me
very angry right now.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.038
- Are you guys
getting a divorce?

05:38.071 --> 05:40.708
- No, Mi--
- Maybe.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.410
Oh, God.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.311
- [sighs]
- Why are we stopping?

05:44.412 --> 05:46.414
- Because Daddy angered the gods

05:46.414 --> 05:48.849
with his "Zero traffic" comment.

05:48.882 --> 05:52.453
See, if you were Jewish,
you would just know this stuff.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.054
[club music]

05:54.087 --> 05:55.489
- A toast to you, Ernie.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.624
And to many more happy returns

05:56.657 --> 05:58.559
for all the von Webers.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.428
- I'll drink to that.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.629
You know, I always say,

06:01.662 --> 06:04.031
behind every Fortune 500 company

06:04.064 --> 06:05.999
is a mother--
or mother-in-law--

06:06.033 --> 06:09.570
with a great ass.
- Ernie, please.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.605
You know, your wife is over
there dipping her strawberries

06:11.639 --> 06:13.841
in my chocolate fountain
as we speak.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.076
- I hope she's enjoying it.

06:16.109 --> 06:19.647

06:19.680 --> 06:21.782
- How is the Montauk Hellway?

06:21.815 --> 06:23.751
- We have been
in a total standstill

06:23.784 --> 06:25.619
for over an hour.

06:25.653 --> 06:26.987
I am losing my mind.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.989
I would jump in front of a car

06:29.022 --> 06:30.524
if any were moving.

06:30.558 --> 06:31.725
Sorry to complain.

06:31.759 --> 06:32.826
Don't you have a double shift?

06:32.860 --> 06:34.528
- Yeah, but it's not too bad.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.997
- "Not too bad"?
What's come over you?

06:37.030 --> 06:38.999
- Nothing--oh, we tried
that fondue place

06:39.032 --> 06:40.901
you love last night.
Delish!

06:40.934 --> 06:42.636
- "We"? Who's "We"?

06:42.670 --> 06:44.572
You mean--you mean,
you and Graham?

06:44.605 --> 06:46.073
- Yes, me and Graham.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.576
Or "Graham and I,"
if my mom's listening.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.645
- Vaness, I can hear you
blushing through the phone.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.113
Wow, I guess I have to get
used to you guys

06:53.146 --> 06:55.516
being a couple again.
Mazel tov.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.884
- Save it.
I told you,

06:56.917 --> 06:58.719
he's leaving in a few weeks.

06:58.752 --> 07:02.155
Better go--I have a patient
in a coma with very grim odds.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.091
- Oh, I hate when
you do that to me.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.594
Now I feel bad
complaining about traffic.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.028
- Don't--I've driven
to Maine with your kids.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.497
I'd rather be here.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.632
- [laughs] Okay.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.066
[horns honking]

07:13.100 --> 07:14.635
All right, that's it.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.404
I'm gonna go see
what the hell is going on.

of my life.

You're being dramatic.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.688
Okay, here comes Jill.
- [whining]

07:34.722 --> 07:38.125

07:38.158 --> 07:40.193
What'd they say?
- [sighs]

07:40.227 --> 07:41.629
Nothing.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.764
The reason for the traffic
is nothing.

07:43.797 --> 07:47.668
No construction. No accidents.
Nothing.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.137

getting out of here.

You're probably not checking
your messages,

08:05.185 --> 08:06.887
but we are so, so sorry.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.989
I know how important it was
for us to be there

08:09.022 --> 08:10.791
for your big welcome speech,

08:10.824 --> 08:14.027
but please, start without us.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.597
[sighs] God, I hope they're not
waiting for us

08:16.630 --> 08:17.965

- Janice, teach us
some new moves.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.580
What are they doing
in da clubs?

08:32.613 --> 08:34.114
- Uh, well, okay.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.149
I'm a little out of it
these days, but...

08:36.183 --> 08:38.819

exactly skyrocketed.

like Trixie said.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.474
- What are you talking about,
hon?

09:01.508 --> 09:03.611
Two hours ago you were
on top of the world.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.945
- I mean, I know I don't suck,

09:04.978 --> 09:06.914
but what if I'm only average?

09:06.947 --> 09:08.448
I always thought that
kids were just

09:08.481 --> 09:10.483
a rest stop from work, but...

09:10.517 --> 09:11.785
- We're bored.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.453
- Maybe I'm just better
at the mom thing,

09:13.486 --> 09:14.755
and I should accept it.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.690
- Hello?
- My arm hurts.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.626
- Guys, I'm trying
to talk to Daddy.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.060
Please stop interrupting.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.461
At least I know
I'm good at that.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.196
Maybe that's my real calling.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.832
- Can we watch another movie?

09:24.865 --> 09:27.901
all: Mo-vie! Mo-vie!
Mo-vie!

09:27.935 --> 09:31.238
- Guys, stop chanting,
or I will climb back there

09:31.271 --> 09:34.908
and make you regret
you ever met me!

09:34.942 --> 09:39.012
You know what I mean?

09:39.046 --> 09:41.915
[farting]

09:41.949 --> 09:43.851
- Sorry about that, Mr. Evans.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.119
- [gurgles]

09:46.153 --> 09:48.188
[wheezing]

09:48.221 --> 09:49.990
[grunting]

09:50.023 --> 09:53.026
- Holy shit.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.830
all: Mo-vie! Mo-vie!

09:56.864 --> 09:58.666
- Okay, they burned through
everything else.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.734
We're down to "Sound of Music"
or "Gandhi."

10:00.768 --> 10:02.535
"Gandhi" is longer, I think.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.104
- "Sound of Music."
It has kids.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.006
It'll be more fun for them.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.175
[musical fanfare]

10:08.208 --> 10:11.712
- But why would Rolfe turn
so mean all of a sudden?

10:11.745 --> 10:14.614
- Because he's a Nazi.
- What's a Nazi?

10:14.648 --> 10:16.183
- Bad guys.
- Are they real?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.551
- Yes.
- Are they gonna get us?

10:18.585 --> 10:20.087
- I'm scared.
- Mom?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.055
- Shh. Okay, guys.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.291
A long time ago,
there was a lot

10:24.324 --> 10:26.626
of economic disparity
in Germany,

10:26.660 --> 10:28.561
and somebody
had to take the blame.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.297
- So, if they caught
the von Trapps,

10:30.330 --> 10:31.932
would they have killed them?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.566
- The Nazis would kill people?

10:33.600 --> 10:36.704
- No!
I mean, yes.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.539
- Look, guys, the point is,
they weren't caught.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.709
They got away,
thanks to those awesome nuns,

10:41.742 --> 10:45.012
and now they own a prosperous
B&B in Vermont.

10:45.045 --> 10:48.048
[horns honking]

10:50.283 --> 10:52.686
- Oh, my God. Did you see that?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.688
Excuse me?

10:54.722 --> 10:56.957
I think you dropped something.
- I'm sorry?

10:56.990 --> 10:59.126
- That bottle that just
flew out of your car?

10:59.159 --> 11:01.061
I think you meant to put it
in a trash can.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.930
- [groans]
- Hon, back off.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.331
You never know who carries a gun

11:04.364 --> 11:05.866
in their glove compartment
these days.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.735
- No, I am sick and tired

11:07.735 --> 11:09.737
of people not standing up
for what's right.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.305
If people had spoken up earlier
during World War II,

11:12.339 --> 11:14.875
the world would be a very
different place right now.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.745
- Excuse me?
Did you just call me a Nazi?

11:17.745 --> 11:19.579
- No.
- Stop talking.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.114
Just roll up your window.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.950
- Well, that would be obvious.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.085
I'm in a very delicate
situation here.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.754
- And whose fault is that?

11:26.754 --> 11:29.156
- I hate when people litter.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.924
- Well, I hate nosy bitches.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.827
Enjoy.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.363
- Hey. Follow her.
Go on that side road thing.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.065
- Hon, only sleazebags
use the shoulder.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.632
It's for emergencies.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.068
- Well, this is an emergency.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.804
We're missing
the dark chocolate fountain.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.638
- [sighs]

11:45.672 --> 11:47.674
- Here you go, princess.
- Ah.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.376
- Oh, she's on a diet.
- Just eat a little.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.545
- Nice girl.
- Thank you.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.548
Janice, I'm so glad you could
come today.

11:55.582 --> 11:59.052
I hope the whole "White" theme
isn't offensive to you.

11:59.086 --> 12:03.356
I want you to know I support
#BlackLivesMatter.

12:03.390 --> 12:07.660
#Okay?

12:07.694 --> 12:09.797
- Brooke, I have to
say something.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.031
- Tell me who it is.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.332
Tell me who treated you
differently

12:12.365 --> 12:13.901
because of the color
of your skin

12:13.934 --> 12:15.368
and I will fire her today.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.838
- Ah...this is awkward.

12:17.871 --> 12:22.675
Um, I've been...
getting the impression...

12:22.709 --> 12:25.212
that you think I'm black.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.115
- The term is
"African American,"

12:28.148 --> 12:30.951
and honestly, I don't see color.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.419
I just see people.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.221
- Brooke, come on.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.990
You always insist on
calling me "J'neece."

12:37.024 --> 12:38.225
You always want
to gossip with me

12:38.258 --> 12:41.161
about Kanye and Idris Elba.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.863
You got me that "Essence"
subscription--

12:42.896 --> 12:43.997
you know, which I appreciate,

12:44.031 --> 12:45.265
and the articles are great--

12:45.298 --> 12:47.400
- Janice, we're all equal--

12:47.434 --> 12:49.269
- For the last time,
it's not "J'neece."

12:49.302 --> 12:53.841
It's Janice.
And I'm not black.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.309
- But you identify
as black, right?

12:56.343 --> 12:58.645
Aren't you from Detroit?
- No.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.849
Bloomfield Hills.
I'm white.

13:01.882 --> 13:02.850
[chuckles]

13:02.883 --> 13:05.853
- [sighs] Well...

13:05.853 --> 13:09.122
You really led us down the
primrose path, didn't you?

13:09.156 --> 13:12.092
Throwing in all those "Aights"
and "Grrrls"!

13:12.125 --> 13:15.428
- That was you.
Not me.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.932
Now that I think about it,
I am retroactively offended.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.868
In fact, I have
half a mind to call

13:20.901 --> 13:22.769
the Southern Poverty Law Center
and report

13:22.870 --> 13:25.005
that my civil rights
have been violated.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.306
- But you're not black.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.876
- Yeah, but you thought I was.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.477
So all those things
you said to me

13:30.510 --> 13:33.313
were very offensive--
if I had been.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.282
- But you're not.
- Yeah.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.017
And actually, as a white person,

13:37.050 --> 13:38.886
I was also discriminated against

13:38.886 --> 13:40.353
because you gave
preferential treatment

13:40.387 --> 13:42.455
to someone solely based
on their race.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.892
- But it was you.
- It was black me.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.359
Not white me.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.062
You'll be hearing from
white me's lawyers.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.798
Excuse me.

13:51.899 --> 13:55.102
- Oh, my God.
- Mind blown.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.937
- I'm just gonna say it:

13:56.970 --> 13:59.239
I thought she was a little
boring for a black person.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.342
[hip-hop music]

14:05.979 --> 14:07.915
c]
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.582
- Why are you whispering?
- 'Cause you're whispering.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.051
Why are you whispering?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.385
- Well, you know how I had

14:12.419 --> 14:14.354
that terminal comatose patient?

14:14.387 --> 14:17.057
- Oh, no. Did he croak?
- Actually, no.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.926
I seem to have brought him
back to life.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.928
- Oh, my God! Miracle worker.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.362
Why are you never in
that "Best Doctors"

14:22.395 --> 14:23.964
issue of "New York" magazine?

14:23.997 --> 14:26.133
- Uh, well, before you call
the editor,

14:26.166 --> 14:28.568
you should know I think
I cured him with a massive fart.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.338
[laughter]

14:31.371 --> 14:34.141
I'm on speaker?
Hi, guys.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.944
Hating you.
- Why?

14:36.944 --> 14:39.346
You gave us our first laugh
in hours.

14:39.379 --> 14:43.050
More miracles.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.052
- [grunts]
Hey, great news.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.088
Just got another tasty offer
for your wife's company.

14:48.121 --> 14:51.324
Can't say I'm surprised.
- Huh.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.793
Feels a little premature,
don't you think?

14:53.826 --> 14:57.330
- Hell, no, got to strike
when the iron's hot.

14:57.364 --> 15:01.868
Dude, was I wrong
about the bagels?

15:01.969 --> 15:04.137
- Joseph wants to open
a store in Chicago?

15:04.171 --> 15:06.206
- He was just here, yeah.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.008
Oh, my God. Joy!

15:08.041 --> 15:11.311
You actually came!
- Of course I came.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.114
I'm so sorry to be late.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.316
The traffic was, shall we say,
trying.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.085
- Oh, well,
if you're saying that,

15:18.118 --> 15:20.053
it must have been unbearable.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.488
Who's more patient than you?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.423
- No one!

15:23.456 --> 15:25.558
- Guys, Joy Green,

15:25.592 --> 15:29.029
author of "The Joy Manifesto"
is in the house!

15:29.062 --> 15:31.431
[cheering]

15:31.464 --> 15:33.266
- This is great!

15:33.300 --> 15:35.168
How did we ever
live without this?

15:35.202 --> 15:37.304
- I want a cookie.
- Dottie, no.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.306
You're already cracked-out
on sugar as it is.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.408
- We have lots of other options.
- I want a cookie!

15:41.441 --> 15:43.910
- Smushed banana,
seaweed shards,

15:44.011 --> 15:46.013
cheddar bunny dust--
this is disgusting.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.480
- Cookie!
- Not so much fun

15:47.514 --> 15:49.316
being on snack bag duty,
is it?

15:49.349 --> 15:51.018
I love driving.
- Cookie!

15:51.051 --> 15:53.020
- It's in park.
Okay.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.088
Dottie, have some pineapple.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.923
See? Problem solved.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.625
- So, what are we gonna discuss

15:58.658 --> 16:01.294
now that I know that you hate
the one project

16:01.328 --> 16:03.930
I've been excited about
since going freelance.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.133
- That's not what I said.
- Mommy?

16:06.166 --> 16:09.036
- Dottie, I said no more
cookies, end of story.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.671
Don't ask again.
- Um, guys?

16:11.704 --> 16:13.940
Dottie looks weird.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.175
- Oh, shit!

16:15.208 --> 16:16.409
- We have to get her
to a hospital.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.046
- Okay, sleazebag lane,
here we come.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.414
[tires squealing]
- [screaming] Oh, my God!

16:21.448 --> 16:24.384
Mom!
- Mommy!

16:29.389 --> 16:32.059
- Yeah, just
an allergic reaction.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.694
Swelling's down.
That Benadryl works fast.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.397
- So, note to self:
no pineapples for Dottie.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.499
And thank you for looking
at Hazel's head.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.134
- And for doing that CAT scan.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.569
- We were running pretty fast.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.504
- My arm still hurts.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.639
- Oh, boy.
Everyone wants attention.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.075
* Drama

16:48.075 --> 16:50.110
- Anyway, thank you again,
Doctor.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.678
We will get out of your way.
Come on, guys.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.280
- No, seriously.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.083
It's been hurting since Tuesday
after the game.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.185
- Well, what happened
on Tuesday, huh?

16:58.218 --> 17:00.387
Maybe I should take a look.
- Why not?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.155
I'm sure your mother's already

17:02.189 --> 17:03.623
excommunicated us by now.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.759
- And to have everyone here
that I truly care about

17:06.793 --> 17:10.097
all in one place is like a dream
come true to me.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.233
My son Alexander and his
beautiful wife,

17:13.266 --> 17:15.402
Brooke von Weber,
whose handbag line

17:15.435 --> 17:17.104
is taking the world by storm!

17:17.104 --> 17:19.706
[cheers and applause]

17:19.739 --> 17:23.110
And, uh, Jill and Anderson...

17:23.110 --> 17:25.178
who do things...

17:25.212 --> 17:26.746
they're--they're
around here somewhere.

17:26.779 --> 17:30.016
Anyway, please enjoy Bronson's
latest decadence:

17:30.117 --> 17:34.121
ice cream sandwiches made with
grain alcohol gelato.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.256
And just warn the children,
please.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.291
[laughter]

17:38.325 --> 17:40.493
- Babe, great news.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.229
Pete just got a sick offer

17:42.262 --> 17:44.697
from a guy who wants
to buy von Weber.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.299
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.300
I think we should do it.

17:47.334 --> 17:50.203
Strike while the iron's hot.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.239
- So, you mean someone else

17:52.272 --> 17:55.275
would own my company
and my name?

17:55.308 --> 17:57.310
- Yes, but you'd be set.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.978
You'd never have to work again.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.448
- I didn't have to work before.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.616
I love what I'm doing, Lex.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.718
- But you're so busy
and stressed.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.488
Don't you want to get back to
focusing on your philanthropy,

18:08.521 --> 18:11.258
the kids, get back
to being Class Mom--

18:11.291 --> 18:13.493
- No, I'm never going back.

18:13.526 --> 18:16.496
Do you still not understand
that I've changed?

18:16.529 --> 18:18.431
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.833
- I built von Weber
from nothing.

18:20.867 --> 18:25.738
- [chuckles]
Well, not exactly from nothing.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.640
- How dare you.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.677
Plenty of people have seed money
and then blow it.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.612
[sighs] You know what?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.547
I don't want to do this again.
I can't.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.183
- Can't what?

18:36.216 --> 18:39.352
Brooke, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

18:39.386 --> 18:42.054
About our vows renewal?
Are you having doubts?

18:42.088 --> 18:43.356
- I just found out Janice

18:43.390 --> 18:45.725
is a white girl
from the suburbs.

18:45.758 --> 18:49.196
And then a Twitter follower who
I thought was Lee Radziwill

18:49.196 --> 18:50.697
turned out to be a fraud.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.466
I don't know who to believe
anymore.

18:53.500 --> 18:57.370
I just--I need some time
to think.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.878
didn't believe you
about the arm.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.214
But I will believe you
when you tell me

19:07.214 --> 19:08.348
you have Type 2 diabetes.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.416
- You know what?

19:09.449 --> 19:10.817
Who needs caviar and champagne

19:10.850 --> 19:12.419
when we can be here.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.787
- And guys, I actually
drove us somewhere

19:14.821 --> 19:17.424
and we all survived.
- Just barely!

19:17.457 --> 19:18.425
- Yay, Mommy!
- Yay!

19:18.458 --> 19:19.892
[all cheering]

19:19.926 --> 19:22.229
- Cheers for Mom.
- Yay, Mommy.

19:22.262 --> 19:25.232
Yay, Mommy.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.334
- Brooke. Hi.
Oh, my God.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.869
Is Candace totally
ripshit that we're not there?

19:29.902 --> 19:31.471
- No.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.840
She's too busy flirting
with Ernie Krevitt.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.142
But I'm really upset.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.810
- Really? I'm so sorry.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.746
We had to make a pit stop
at the ER.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.249
- Can we stay on me?

19:42.249 --> 19:45.818
I just--I think
I'm freaking out about Lex.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.520
- Why? What happened?

19:47.554 --> 19:50.257
- As the day gets closer,
I'm just not sure

19:50.257 --> 19:52.392
that he's the man
I want to marry again.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.860
- Oh, everyone gets cold feet

19:53.893 --> 19:55.695
before a...vows renewal.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.365
- Oh, and you missed
meeting Joy Green.

19:58.398 --> 20:01.200
You guys both always
give me new perspective.

20:01.234 --> 20:04.304
- Oh, thanks, but I'll meet her
at the vows renewal, right?

20:04.337 --> 20:07.173
- Ugh, I just can't think
about that right now.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.708
Tell the kids I'm bringing home

20:08.741 --> 20:11.511
100 Sprinkles cupcakes
for each of them.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.280
- Kids, say "Hi" to Aunt Brooke.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.814
all: Hi, Aunt Brooke.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.617
- Hi, guys.
Everyone missed you.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.951
Jill, I told you
you guys should have

20:18.985 --> 20:20.653
taken the seaplane with us.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.789
- Wait, we could have flown?

20:22.822 --> 20:24.691
- No way!
- Seriously?

20:24.724 --> 20:25.792
- Is that true?
We could have flown?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.294
What's wrong with you?

20:27.327 --> 20:28.595
- Brooke, I'll
call you back later.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.530
If I'm still alive.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.964
- How come you didn't
ask me that?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.566
- Okay, guys, let me explain.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.402
It just felt
a little too extravagant

20:35.435 --> 20:36.836
to fly to Long Island.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.305
And no one feels bad for you

20:38.338 --> 20:40.473
if you die in
a private plane crash.

20:40.507 --> 20:45.211
And we're Webers,
not vons, remember?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.913
- But we could have been
in a seaplane!

20:46.946 --> 20:48.848
- Why don't you ever let us
have any fun?

20:48.881 --> 20:50.917
- Why don't you ever let us
do anything fun?

20:50.950 --> 20:53.553
We missed the party!

20:53.586 --> 20:56.589
[all talking at once]

20:58.825 --> 21:01.394
- Oh, Dr. Wrigley,
Herman was at death's door,

21:01.428 --> 21:02.862
and you wouldn't let him go.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.764
- [groans]
- You saved him.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.566
We owe you everything.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.801
- You know, I wish I could say
I did something

21:08.835 --> 21:09.869
to bring this about.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.604
Medicine is part science,

21:11.638 --> 21:14.907
part art, and the rest
is a mystery.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.444
- It must have come from above.

21:17.477 --> 21:21.614
- Or...below.

21:21.648 --> 21:24.817
- For more "Odd Mom Out,"
go to BravoTV.com.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.786
[seagull chirping]
- Oh, dear.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.590
- Left, right, left, right,
left, right.
