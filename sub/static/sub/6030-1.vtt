01:02.150 --> 01:05.190
<i>All right. All right. That's enough.
All right.</i>

01:39.490 --> 01:42.300
Madiba, this is the delegation---

01:42.600 --> 01:44.390
I know who this is.

01:45.270 --> 01:46.350
Welcome.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.560
Thank you for coming so far to see me.
- Thank you. How do you do?

01:49.610 --> 01:51.610
- I'm fine. Welcome.
- Thank you very much.

01:51.660 --> 01:55.100
<i>Ladies and gentlemen please
apologize. The game is delayed.</i>

01:55.150 --> 01:58.810
<i>...in the semifinals, South Africa
against France...</i>

02:02.940 --> 02:05.790
- This is it. Let's go.
- All right. Go.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.040
<i>...International business alliances.</i>

02:56.950 --> 03:00.400
<i>Strong industries have developed in
shipping and computers</i>

03:00.540 --> 03:01.990
<i>Our information...</i>

03:02.040 --> 03:03.540
Please, excuse me.

03:03.740 --> 03:05.840
<i>Yes, Mr. President, of course.</i>

03:08.900 --> 03:12.100
<i>Gentlemen, let us continue  in ten
minutes...</i>

03:15.230 --> 03:17.030
This is good. Very good!

03:17.800 --> 03:19.850
So, who is our next opponent?

03:20.020 --> 03:23.320
The All Blacks play England tomorrow.
Then, we'll know.

03:23.410 --> 03:24.510
I see.

03:24.700 --> 03:28.700
You will make sure that my schedule
is free for the entire match.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.420
Oh, yes, Tata.

03:30.550 --> 03:33.110
This is good. This is very good.

03:51.750 --> 03:55.400
<i>...black team mates come to
congratulate big fella yet again.</i>

03:55.980 --> 03:58.410
<i>Lomu is becoming one of the most
intimidating...</i>

03:58.460 --> 04:01.360
Why don't we do a little work while
we're here.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.120
Just enjoy the rugby.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.110
<i>...World Cup semifinal against
England.</i>

04:11.080 --> 04:12.850
So, let me understand this.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.760
The All Blacks are killing a team
that thrashed us last year?

04:15.810 --> 04:17.610
Thanks for reminding me.

04:22.550 --> 04:24.050
Yet again.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.800
We're gonna really have to tackle
a lot better than the English are.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.150
- Yeah. That's sure.
- That's sure.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.450
- We do.
- Ja.

04:29.590 --> 04:32.190
<i>That is Lomu's second try this
afternoon.</i>

04:32.690 --> 04:35.710
<i>This guy really likes scoring tries
against the English...</i>

04:35.760 --> 04:39.060
Are those the judicial appointments
for the Free State?

04:39.470 --> 04:42.150
They'll keep until after the match.

04:44.510 --> 04:45.960
<i>Here's the kick.</i>

04:46.930 --> 04:48.930
I'm the President, you know.

04:50.330 --> 04:52.670
<i>And the conversion is good!</i>

04:53.770 --> 04:57.190
Are you watching this guy?
He's about your size, but...

04:57.240 --> 04:59.490
How much does this Lomu weigh?

04:59.630 --> 05:01.530
- 120 kilos.
- Shit.

05:01.880 --> 05:05.030
- Same as me.
- Yeah., but you're slow.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.080
Lomu looks for contact every time
he gets the ball.

05:10.130 --> 05:10.840
Ja.

05:10.890 --> 05:11.900
It's good for us.

05:11.950 --> 05:12.760
Ja.

05:12.870 --> 05:16.030
I will break my arm,
my leg, my neck,

05:16.620 --> 05:18.300
but I will not let that frickin' guy
go.

05:18.350 --> 05:19.550
With you, cappie.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.650
- With you, captain.
- With you, cappie. With you.

05:28.970 --> 05:31.420
...when you pass it, yeah? Grab this.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.690
Run!

05:38.060 --> 05:39.030
Yes.

05:43.890 --> 05:46.790
Still think I'm wasting my time with
the rugby?

05:54.070 --> 05:56.070
<i>...he's in the clear and he will...</i>

05:56.120 --> 05:59.720
Brenda, please tell the Minister
of Sport

05:59.920 --> 06:02.810
I'd like the full report on
the All Blacks.

06:04.160 --> 06:07.590
This rugby, it's still strictly
political?

06:07.640 --> 06:09.540
Oh yes. Oh yes. Of course.

06:18.310 --> 06:19.910
Hello, Francois.

06:24.530 --> 06:26.460
Don't lose them. I won't be able
to get more.

06:26.510 --> 06:27.960
Thanks, Francois.

06:28.740 --> 06:31.840
Me, mom, Nerine--- wait,

06:32.520 --> 06:33.870
and the fourth?

06:34.140 --> 06:35.390
Who's it for?

06:54.230 --> 06:57.440
The All Blacks beat Ireland 43 to 19.

06:57.920 --> 06:58.890
I see.

06:58.970 --> 07:01.200
They beat Wales 34 to 9.

07:01.710 --> 07:02.610
I see.

07:02.670 --> 07:05.920
They beat Japan 145 to 17.

07:06.690 --> 07:09.660
145 points, in one match?

07:09.990 --> 07:12.190
It's a new international record.

07:12.980 --> 07:16.080
They beat Scotland 48 to 30 in the
quarter finals.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.320
You saw the match with England.

07:18.370 --> 07:19.240
Yes.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.840
45 to 29. And it was not that close.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.730
They seem unstoppable.

07:28.090 --> 07:32.510
If the opposing teams play them
straight up, Jonah Lomu runs wild.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.610
If they focus on Lomu, that leaves
others free.

07:35.860 --> 07:38.610
And, also, there's the business of
the haka.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.640
A Maori war dance. Yes.

07:41.340 --> 07:42.890
It's very powerful.

07:45.730 --> 07:48.200
My sources tell me that half of the
All Black matches

07:48.250 --> 07:51.200
are won before the first whistle,
because of it.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.900
How can we beat them?

07:54.770 --> 07:58.370
I have the coach's number.
Maybe, you could call him and ask.

07:58.420 --> 08:03.360
No. no. I don't want to distract
their focus, even for one minute.

08:05.130 --> 08:07.770
But, how can we win?

08:08.180 --> 08:11.260
Maybe we won't. They're favored
two-to-one.

08:12.190 --> 08:16.380
Madiba, we've already exceeded all
expectations. On and off the field.

08:17.140 --> 08:21.170
It's not enough. Not now.
Not so close.

08:23.220 --> 08:26.540
This country is hungry for greatness.

08:47.090 --> 08:49.790
I brought one of your mom's protein
shakes.

08:55.190 --> 08:56.990
Thinking about tomorrow?

08:57.830 --> 08:58.580
No,

08:59.890 --> 09:01.740
tomorrow's taken care of,

09:02.740 --> 09:04.290
one way or another.

09:06.370 --> 09:10.700
I'm was thinking about how you
spend 30 years in a tiny cell,

09:13.410 --> 09:16.910
and come out ready to forgive
the people who put you there.

09:25.220 --> 09:28.370
Go home, man. There's nothing more
you can do today.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.820
Have I ever mentioned to you that
I hate rugby?

09:36.030 --> 09:38.100
Once or twice, yes.

09:40.890 --> 09:43.840
I just want to get him through
tomorrow, safely.

09:44.340 --> 09:45.490
That's all.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.100
We all do.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.360
The tickets sold out long before
the team became popular.

10:17.950 --> 10:21.740
it's not exactly going to be the
rainbow nation out there.

10:22.730 --> 10:24.480
And that's the reality.

10:25.110 --> 10:29.830
Now, all it takes is one idiot
trying to make a statement,

10:30.700 --> 10:35.000
or one fool who thinks that he hears
god speaking to him through the radio.

10:35.970 --> 10:37.620
It's happened before!

10:37.810 --> 10:39.310
But not today.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.340
Not on our watch.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.100
And not today.

11:23.910 --> 11:25.780
Hey. Flag face. Flag face.

11:25.830 --> 11:27.680
- Flag face?
- Bugger off!

11:33.930 --> 11:36.720
We're at Ellis Park on this historic
day,

11:36.820 --> 11:41.950
where, even this early, crowd
expectation is at fever pitch...

11:42.700 --> 11:45.750
<i>because their beloved green and gold</i>

11:45.820 --> 11:49.570
<i>have somehow managed to defy all
expectations.</i>

11:49.810 --> 11:54.680
<i>But now they come up against a team
unlike any they have played before.</i>

11:55.330 --> 12:00.440
<i>These All Blacks are possibly one of
the greatest international sides ever,</i>

12:00.590 --> 12:05.055
<i>with a player in Jonah Lomu
who is as dominant as any</i>

12:05.290 --> 12:07.540
<i>this correspondent has ever seen.</i>

12:20.240 --> 12:21.680
Madiba!

13:13.980 --> 13:15.780
Final approach, Captain.

13:17.590 --> 13:20.930
Let it be noted that I'm taking
control of the aircraft.

13:20.980 --> 13:22.480
Duly noted.

13:23.750 --> 13:27.100
I take full responsibility for what
happens from now on.

13:47.650 --> 13:49.900
Do you see that jet, to the east?

13:52.090 --> 13:53.570
<i>Did they get clearance for this?</i>

13:53.620 --> 13:55.120
Not from us.

13:58.030 --> 13:59.390
Where is he?

13:59.610 --> 14:01.110
<i>VIP box.</i>

14:01.450 --> 14:03.350
Get him out of there. Now.

14:03.740 --> 14:05.240
No time.

14:30.860 --> 14:32.610
What the hell was that?

15:14.530 --> 15:16.030
- Boka!
- Yeah.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.980
Come on!

15:54.830 --> 15:58.610
<i>...World Cup Finals.</i>

16:13.090 --> 16:16.980
<i>Please welcome the South African
Springboks!</i>

16:31.090 --> 16:33.510
<i>And New Zealand; All blacks.</i>

17:12.160 --> 17:14.500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome</i>

17:14.550 --> 17:17.710
<i>The President of the Republic of
South Africa</i>

17:18.030 --> 17:20.910
<i>Mr. Nelson Mandela.</i>

17:30.830 --> 17:33.380
<i>Dr. Nelson Mandela, the President of
South Africa</i>

17:33.430 --> 17:36.680
<i>in the rugby jersey with the number
six on its back...</i>

17:37.460 --> 17:39.510
The All Black's won't like it.

17:41.550 --> 17:44.970
Francois, your country is very
proud of you.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.650
Thank you, sir.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.510
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.650
- ...Mr. President.
- Mr. President. Thank you.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.450
Good luck to you, son.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.230
Good luck to you, son.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.490
<i>Both teams are out there with
Dr. Mandela.</i>

18:04.230 --> 18:09.310
Chester, I want you to know that
your whole country is supporting you.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.680
- Good luck.
- Thank  you, sir.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.880
- Good luck, son.
- Thank you.

18:13.930 --> 18:15.810
<i>What a dramatic moment here in
Ellis park.</i>

18:15.860 --> 18:19.310
<i>I don't think I've ever seen so many
flags in one stadium.</i>

18:28.620 --> 18:30.270
- Hi.
- Their captain.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.950
I'm honored, sir.

18:35.430 --> 18:37.010
Mr. President...

18:37.060 --> 18:38.930
- Yonah?
- Yes. Jonah, sir.

18:38.980 --> 18:40.530
- Nice to see you.
- Yes. Thank you.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.530
I'm a little afraid of you.

18:42.790 --> 18:44.740
<i>...and that's big Jonah Lomu.</i>

18:44.790 --> 18:46.290
<i>A big day for him.</i>

18:48.500 --> 18:50.610
- We're all together now.
- Yes.

18:50.660 --> 18:51.760
Good luck.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.870
"Nelson... Nelson... Nelson..."

18:57.570 --> 18:59.890
"NELSON... NELSON... NELSON..."

19:04.750 --> 19:09.270
<i>...Dr. Mandela just lifting his cap
to the sixty-two thousand people....</i>

19:09.330 --> 19:11.960
"Nelson... Nelson... Nelson..."

19:25.173 --> 19:27.721
...wonderful aerial shot of...

19:28.160 --> 19:29.960
<i>...Ellis Park Stadium...</i>

19:34.130 --> 19:36.990
<i>Very emotional moment for both
teams.</i>

19:55.710 --> 19:59.810
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the national
anthem of South Africa.</i>

20:01.700 --> 20:03.850
<i>South African National Anthems.</i>

20:35.100 --> 20:38.350
<i>What an unbelievable spectacular
year in Johannesburg.</i>

21:51.580 --> 21:54.280
Perhaps we should make a little
wager.

21:56.090 --> 21:58.380
All your gold, for all our sheep?

22:00.370 --> 22:04.750
Well I was thinking more along the
lines of a case of wine.

22:08.930 --> 22:11.400
<i>The celebration's over. We now come
to the big game.</i>

22:11.450 --> 22:14.240
<i>And we'll wait the Haka of
New Zealand.</i>

22:14.960 --> 22:16.400
¶ Kia rite! ¶

22:18.910 --> 22:20.330
¶ Kia rite! ¶

22:21.560 --> 22:23.070
¶ Kia rite! ¶

22:23.850 --> 22:24.950
¶ Kia mau! ¶

22:25.000 --> 22:26.370
¶ Hi! ¶

22:28.220 --> 22:30.160
¶ Ringa ringa pakia ¶

22:30.630 --> 22:34.390
¶ Waewae takahia kia kino nei hoki! ¶

22:34.850 --> 22:37.490
¶ A kia kino nei hoki! ¶

22:37.990 --> 22:40.800
¶ A Ka Mate! Ka Mate! Ka Ora! ¶

22:40.970 --> 22:43.780
¶ A Ka Mate! Ka Mate! Ka Ora! ¶

22:44.050 --> 22:47.300
¶ A Ka Mate! Ka Mate! Puhuru huru ¶

22:47.350 --> 22:50.320
¶ Nana nei i tiki mai whakawhiti te ra ¶

22:50.430 --> 22:52.680
¶ A upane, ka upane ¶

22:52.810 --> 22:54.420
¶ A upane, ka upane ¶

22:54.470 --> 22:55.510
¶ Whiti te ra, ¶

22:55.560 --> 22:56.450
<i>¶ hi! ¶</i>

22:56.500 --> 23:00.900
<i>...that's the challenge, laid down by
the Maoris before going into battle...</i>

23:23.230 --> 23:26.830
<i>New Zealand as best team gets
in the final of the tournament.</i>

23:51.830 --> 23:54.160
- Hey! Get out of here.
- Hey!

24:02.170 --> 24:03.400
Put it down!

24:05.681 --> 24:08.281
...knocked him down and stole the
ball...

24:08.850 --> 24:10.020
<i>...put into play by New Zealand.</i>

24:10.070 --> 24:13.020
<i>Now here's the chance for them on
the outside...</i>

24:17.310 --> 24:18.340
Engate.

24:20.450 --> 24:21.410
Right.

24:30.590 --> 24:32.090
Come, boys.

24:33.150 --> 24:36.200
What the heck are we doing?
Lomu is killing us.

24:36.750 --> 24:39.360
Forwards, we must start scrumming.

24:40.470 --> 24:41.980
We must disrupt them at the first
phase.

24:42.030 --> 24:43.940
We can't allow Lomu to get the ball
and space.

24:43.990 --> 24:45.670
He's frickin' killing us.

24:45.720 --> 24:50.330
But listen, if Lomu gets the ball,
whoever is there... James, Joost...

24:51.180 --> 24:53.850
Hit the fucking guy. Hold on to him.
Hold it.

24:53.900 --> 24:56.320
Help will come. Help will be there.

25:01.690 --> 25:05.090
<i>...the big Jonah Lomu and give
him some time and space...</i>

25:28.980 --> 25:29.930
Oh! No!

25:42.170 --> 25:44.930
<i>...most of the opportunities have
gone New Zealand's way...</i>

25:44.980 --> 25:46.130
Go. Go. Go!

26:01.700 --> 26:04.100
Listen up. Captain...

26:16.200 --> 26:18.400
<i>...first blood to New Zealand...</i>

27:26.210 --> 27:28.410
Empty. Thirty four.

27:33.660 --> 27:36.410
<i>...such an important kick for
New Zealand...</i>

27:45.720 --> 27:49.760
<i>... score now: New Zealand 6,
South Africa 3.</i>

27:50.590 --> 27:52.260
<i>...It's a great kick from...</i>

27:52.310 --> 27:56.760
<i>Thirteen minutes gone now. Six points to
three New Zealand beats South Africa.</i>

28:04.050 --> 28:05.050
Come on!

28:20.220 --> 28:22.490
<i>...twenty-one minutes gone now...</i>

28:44.400 --> 28:48.400
<i>...South Africa goes into the lead
for the first time in the match...</i>

28:52.530 --> 28:54.930
<i>...advantage for South Africa 9:6...</i>

29:30.070 --> 29:32.250
<i>...attempt for New Zealand...</i>

29:34.250 --> 29:35.900
Boys. It's all right.

30:06.600 --> 30:10.590
<i>Unsuccessful kick. The score remains
9:9.</i>

30:10.970 --> 30:13.920
<i>...that's closing score nine point
all.</i>

30:14.160 --> 30:16.960
<i>And now, there will be a five
minutes' break.</i>

30:17.260 --> 30:21.310
<i>Twenty final minutes in the World Cup.
We're gonna have an extra time.</i>

30:23.960 --> 30:25.160
<i>Extra time.</i>

30:26.780 --> 30:28.580
So, what does this mean?

30:29.240 --> 30:31.240
Extra time. Twenty minutes.

30:32.870 --> 30:34.870
I don't think I can take it.

30:35.150 --> 30:37.450
<i>Oh, this will be a test of great
character,</i>

30:37.500 --> 30:40.200
<i>in these last twenty minutes of this
match.</i>

30:41.720 --> 30:44.170
Who's the fittest team on this field?

30:44.520 --> 30:46.970
Who's the fittest team on this field?

31:08.670 --> 31:10.030
Engate.

31:12.450 --> 31:13.360
Right.

31:45.010 --> 31:48.010
New Zealand 12, South Africa 9.

31:52.980 --> 31:56.720
<i>xxx in reserve, because...
High, high above the crossbar.</i>

32:12.190 --> 32:13.890
<i>Penalty against green.</i>

32:20.080 --> 32:21.290
Francois...

32:23.330 --> 32:25.950
Too many guys off their feet.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.150
- Oh, yes.
- Speak to your team.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.530
Okay.

32:36.440 --> 32:37.490
Heads up!

32:38.140 --> 32:39.540
Look in my eyes.

32:40.660 --> 32:41.860
Do you hear?

32:42.470 --> 32:44.220
Listen to your country.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.060
Seven minutes.

32:46.540 --> 32:47.740
Seven minutes.

32:47.790 --> 32:49.690
Defense, defense, defense!

32:49.860 --> 32:51.160
This is it!

32:51.440 --> 32:53.040
This is our destiny.

32:53.330 --> 32:54.570
Come on.

32:54.660 --> 32:56.600
- Come.
- Come on.

33:00.380 --> 33:02.180
How long before the end?

33:02.700 --> 33:04.020
Seven minutes.

33:08.280 --> 33:11.730
<i>This will be the longest seven
minutes for both two teams.</i>

35:11.530 --> 35:13.920
<i>...can hear the big man coming...</i>

35:46.050 --> 35:47.190
Now!

36:15.500 --> 36:17.320
<i>...has he got 'em?...</i>

37:00.390 --> 37:02.910
<i>...great play there...</i>

39:21.730 --> 39:24.180
Chester, will you lead us in
a prayer?

39:24.940 --> 39:27.550
Thanks Lord, for getting us into
this final.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.750
Thanks for no serious injuries.

39:29.820 --> 39:32.580
and most of all, thanks for the win,
amen.

39:33.050 --> 39:34.040
"Amen"

39:42.460 --> 39:43.760
Good game.

41:08.980 --> 41:11.160
Francois... a few words...

41:12.440 --> 41:14.990
Great game, but you could've done it

41:15.040 --> 41:19.960
without the amazing support of 63,000
South Africans here today.

41:20.140 --> 41:23.650
Ja. We didn't have the support of
63,000 South Africans.

41:23.920 --> 41:26.890
We had the support of 43 million
South Africans.

41:42.360 --> 41:45.810
I want to thank you for what you
have done to our country.

41:45.960 --> 41:49.910
No, Mr. President, thank you for what
you have done for our country.

43:25.150 --> 43:28.100
- This route's too crowded.
- Change to route C.

43:28.380 --> 43:29.350
Okay.

43:31.580 --> 43:32.880
It's no hurry.

43:33.900 --> 43:35.300
No hurry at all.

43:37.480 --> 43:39.780
Madiba says it's no need to hurry.

43:51.070 --> 43:53.650
"I thank whatever gods may be"

43:54.530 --> 43:56.600
"For my unconquerable soul."

43:57.740 --> 43:59.880
"I am the master of my fate:"

44:01.030 --> 44:03.240
"I am the captain of my soul."
