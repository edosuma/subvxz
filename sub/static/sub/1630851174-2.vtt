That's his name. It's, um...

his first name's Saul,

14:09.166 --> 14:10.708

just calls him Poli.

Now you know.

-That's a relief, I guess.
-I don't know anything.

I don't know
what's going on here.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.916
I told you what's going on.
I don't...

It's a seven-hour

18:24.666 --> 18:26.041

Don't say that. I'm leaving you.
I'm not leaving her.

two weeks from today,

19:46.750 --> 19:48.958
and-- and, you know,
when I'm back from this trip,

19:49.041 --> 19:51.500
we're gonna be together a lot,

right now? Go ahead.

you didn't even notice.

And then Kate saw
that I was in bad shape,

21:30.375 --> 21:32.166

she set me straight.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.375

any responsibility.

that it is.

I had a crazy thought
the other night where I just...

23:54.833 --> 23:56.125
I thought of checking
my own pulse

23:56.208 --> 23:57.958
to see if I was still alive.

23:58.041 --> 23:59.875

like you can't breathe.

-Yeah, yeah. That I--

24:06.000 --> 24:07.750

like a constant asthma attack.

I'm just thinking...

"Is this it?" It's like...

24:27.416 --> 24:30.208
Is this all I'm gonna have?

what the problem was

25:06.166 --> 25:08.583
then I remembered what
it was like, and now I...

25:08.666 --> 25:09.833
I can't go back.

25:11.458 --> 25:13.791
You can go back.
You can,

25:13.875 --> 25:16.291
-you just don't want to.
-No, I can't.

25:16.375 --> 25:18.000
I can't.
I tried a hundred times.

25:18.625 --> 25:20.375

25:20.458 --> 25:22.875

-Right.

it's embarrassing,

but, you know...

26:43.166 --> 26:44.541
I wanna hear about him.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.416
Why? What good would that do?

26:50.125 --> 26:51.166
I wanna know.

26:51.250 --> 26:52.791
Why? Why do you wanna
torture yourself?

26:52.875 --> 26:55.458
Do you have a picture of him?
Of course you do.

26:57.208 --> 26:58.333
-Can I see it?
-Jonathan, no.

26:58.416 --> 26:59.625
-Please, let's not do this.
-Please?

26:59.708 --> 27:02.375
-Not right now. Don't--
-Yes, yes, right now. Right now.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.416

29:30.416 --> 29:31.666

29:36.875 --> 29:38.333
I'd had a lot to drink,
and there--

29:38.416 --> 29:40.375
and there was
a lot of coke there. So, yeah.

29:40.458 --> 29:43.625
(INHALES)
I was dancing and, um,

29:45.375 --> 29:46.458
he came over.

29:47.375 --> 29:49.250
Mm-hmm. And?

29:50.541 --> 29:51.583
And...

29:53.666 --> 29:55.708
he said that I was the first...

29:57.791 --> 29:59.208
American woman he had met

29:59.291 --> 30:01.208
who wasn't constantly trying
to please everyone,

30:01.291 --> 30:02.666

And...

30:22.958 --> 30:24.083
then we kissed.

And then, um...

-Honey.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.541
It was mostly funny at first.

31:01.625 --> 31:03.166
-It was funny?
-MIRA: Yeah.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.833
Um, I was just--
I was laughing hysterically.

31:07.916 --> 31:11.333
It was really awkward,
and... (SIGHS)

31:17.833 --> 31:19.416
But it was also liberating...

31:20.500 --> 31:21.666

the room for two days.

31:35.583 --> 31:36.833
I-- I told you that too.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.750
And then I came back and I...

prayed that you couldn't see it
on me, but you were...

31:47.083 --> 31:50.250
you were just so happy
to see me happy again,

31:52.166 --> 31:53.500

it had to stop, every day.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.291
I couldn't do it.

32:24.375 --> 32:27.958
(SNIFFLES) And I even told him,
I told him I wanted out, but...

32:30.041 --> 32:31.583
I couldn't go through with it.

You just don't want to, Mira.
-I can't.

have said

that I'm finally
like myself again.

how we got-- we got so close,

saying this to try to hurt you.

out of my mind

trying to convince me to stay,
