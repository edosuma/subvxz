Smelling Abbi.

10:28.137 --> 10:31.824
Thank you so much, sweet Lincoln.
Thank you for calming me today.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.525
You challenged me to
grow and be a big girl.

10:34.610 --> 10:35.742
Ilana Wexler?

10:35.777 --> 10:36.810
(inhales deeply)

10:36.896 --> 10:38.812
- No, no, no, no, no!

10:42.118 --> 10:45.386
You have to have all three shots

10:45.471 --> 10:46.570
I love my HPV.

10:46.655 --> 10:48.020
I heard your parents
are getting a divorce.

10:48.055 --> 10:49.823

That's what I say to
distract all the kids...

10:51.710 --> 10:52.910

- When they're getting their shot.

10:52.995 --> 10:54.328
That's what they say back to me.

- Oh, one more thing.

11:01.887 --> 11:03.757
Can you turn over, please?

11:05.007 --> 11:06.140
I'm just kidding.

11:06.258 --> 11:07.558
So gullible.

Oh, please, thank your mom
for that Coach bag she got me.

11:11.313 --> 11:13.263
I cannot tell you how many
compliments I get on it.

11:13.349 --> 11:17.618
She really knows how to pick
'em. Doesn't it look so real?

11:19.271 --> 11:20.471
You're kidding.

11:20.506 --> 11:21.321
Mm-hmm.

11:22.908 --> 11:25.108
And a'nudder tang...

11:25.244 --> 11:28.078
Abbi's just incredibly bold and dynamic.

11:28.164 --> 11:31.298
One summer, she traveled across
the country following Phish,

11:31.417 --> 11:32.920
selling mushroom chocolates.

11:32.955 --> 11:34.618
No way, I was a Phish head.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.170
- Me too.
- Me too.

11:36.288 --> 11:38.288
Set the gear shift to the
high gear of your soul.

11:38.424 --> 11:40.048
Run like an antelope outta control.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.342
Yeah, yeah!

11:42.361 --> 11:43.934
Are you a Phish head, too?

11:44.296 --> 11:47.681
No. Not me. Uh, Abbi is.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.266
I just know the one lyric.

11:55.474 --> 11:57.558
You still seem stressed.

11:57.643 --> 11:59.443
You want to blow off some steam?

11:59.578 --> 12:04.510
You know, I'm technically Abbi today, so
if we hook up, it's... kind of a threesome.

12:05.117 --> 12:06.668
To be honest,

12:07.536 --> 12:10.904
I've been working up the courage to
tell you something all day. (gasps)

12:11.242 --> 12:12.687
This is hard.

12:14.827 --> 12:16.627
I hooked up with someone else.

12:20.966 --> 12:22.833
(exhales deeply)

12:25.838 --> 12:27.588
- Not bad.
- Not bad.

12:27.673 --> 12:30.424
I know we just met, so...

12:30.509 --> 12:32.476
I hope this doesn't seem too forward,

12:32.561 --> 12:36.680
but I was wondering what
you think about maybe...

12:36.765 --> 12:38.841
setting me up with Abbi.

12:38.876 --> 12:41.568
She seems really, really cool.

12:41.687 --> 12:44.306
I would love to go out.

12:44.341 --> 12:47.107
Wait, uh, I was talking
about your friend.

12:47.429 --> 12:50.485
No, I know, it's like, "mmmdoy"!

12:50.664 --> 12:53.780
You two are gonna be, like, so hot,
you're gonna be like, "Uhh, uhh, uhh!"

12:53.866 --> 12:56.667
Both get, like, super wet, downtown!

13:05.377 --> 13:06.710
Yeah, yeah!

13:12.101 --> 13:15.820
(Steve Urkel impression) Did I do that?

13:16.781 --> 13:18.197
(bleep)!

13:18.950 --> 13:19.866
Ugh!

13:21.286 --> 13:25.564
So you're telling me she jerked you off
for eight minutes with what kind of oil?

13:25.599 --> 13:27.064
Almond.

13:30.795 --> 13:32.378
Ugh!

13:32.724 --> 13:36.480
Then you had sex doggy
style, and who finished first?

13:36.515 --> 13:37.934
- I don't...
- Tell me!

13:38.186 --> 13:39.526
She did?

13:39.561 --> 13:41.354
Oh!

(grunts)

13:45.226 --> 13:47.393

13:49.597 --> 13:53.149
And then you spooned watching
YouTube videos of news anchor fails.

16:20.348 --> 16:22.381
Listen, on paper, Abbi seems perfect.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.572
But she's just not my type physically.

16:26.354 --> 16:27.937

16:50.328 --> 16:51.961

16:52.046 --> 16:55.297
This isn't me. This is me.

16:55.575 --> 16:59.506
You impersonated someone to
cover a shift at the co-op?

16:59.541 --> 17:04.256
Technically, that is...
how I would explain it.

17:04.342 --> 17:06.392
No way.

17:06.511 --> 17:09.489
The Abbi I've been hearing about all
day would never do something like this.

17:09.791 --> 17:11.180
She would,

17:11.265 --> 17:14.183
'cause I did, for my best friend.

17:15.653 --> 17:17.853
I don't know what's more disgusting.

17:17.989 --> 17:20.156
The fact that you've
been lying to me all day

17:20.241 --> 17:22.549
or the fact that you
tried to cheat the co-op.

17:23.994 --> 17:25.611
This is a place of trust.

17:27.031 --> 17:28.781
In the words of Phish,

17:28.866 --> 17:31.200
"Deduct the carrots from your pay,

17:31.335 --> 17:35.421
you worthless, swampy fool."

17:35.878 --> 17:38.882
"Cavern." I love that song.

17:39.377 --> 17:42.378
Every 46 minutes of it.

17:42.513 --> 17:44.680
How slick was that labia mention, right?

17:44.766 --> 17:46.766
Yeah. How slick.

17:51.139 --> 17:54.056
You signed a billion-year contract

17:54.192 --> 17:58.561
specifically prohibiting
the sharing of shifts.

17:58.646 --> 18:00.358
Guess I didn't read the fine print.

18:00.393 --> 18:02.231
There it is, okay.

18:03.030 --> 18:06.535
I'm sorry, but are you... breastfeeding?

18:06.621 --> 18:09.371
The power of co-op
produce has made me fertile

18:09.457 --> 18:11.659
into my 50s and beyond.

18:11.815 --> 18:12.992
So amazing.

18:13.077 --> 18:15.359
Don't try and butter me up, I'm a vegan.

18:16.214 --> 18:17.663
- No butter.
- I just got it.

18:26.475 --> 18:27.420

18:27.537 --> 18:30.922
- We as a society are very...
- Puh-leeze! I know your type.

18:30.978 --> 18:34.263
You act and you think like
you're all eco-conscious.

18:34.348 --> 18:36.765
But I see you with your iced coffees

18:36.901 --> 18:38.767
and your food to go.

18:38.903 --> 18:43.239
You are garbage island,
and you are officially

18:43.324 --> 18:46.771
disconnected from the co-op for life.

18:46.954 --> 18:49.778
Fine. I hear the Bushwick
co-op is better anyway.

18:49.914 --> 18:52.164
(laughing)

18:52.283 --> 18:54.242
All the co-ops are connected.

18:54.252 --> 18:57.273
We also have connections with
security at Whole Foods. (both gasp)

18:57.390 --> 19:00.956
That's right, you two
are going to be eating

19:01.042 --> 19:04.627
vending machine food

19:04.712 --> 19:10.599
and bodega veggies for the
rest of your very short lives.

19:10.685 --> 19:12.384
Now, get the (bleep) out.

19:12.470 --> 19:13.636

19:22.864 --> 19:24.984
(baby stirs) Oh, latch.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.048
And then he gave her water
for her cranberry pills.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.751
She's prone to UTls.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.136
But you're not jealous at all?

19:32.254 --> 19:35.698
You know, if you love something, you
have to let it have sex with other people.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.236
And then if it comes back to you, dope,

19:37.271 --> 19:39.510
'cause you also get to
have sex with other people.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.562
I never heard that version.

19:41.647 --> 19:42.729
I like it.

19:43.146 --> 19:45.649
My whole arm hurts.

19:45.768 --> 19:49.269
Don't you already have HPV?

19:49.405 --> 19:51.772
Of course I have HPV.

19:51.907 --> 19:54.825
I'd almost be embarrassed
not to have HPV at this point.

19:56.089 --> 19:57.027
Totally.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.829
But now, I don't have the three strains

19:58.948 --> 20:00.831
that can cause cervical cancer.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.416
(chuckling)

20:02.501 --> 20:05.002
You know...

20:05.120 --> 20:07.120
it's okay, what happened with Craig.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.872
It's like, yeah, we hit it off.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.367
Yeah, he was like, really (bleep) hot.

20:11.382 --> 20:14.197
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he seemed to really like "Abbi."

20:14.232 --> 20:16.836
Things just don't work out, but
he was right about one thing.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.410

doubt Phish's best album.

20:25.170 --> 20:25.722

20:25.808 --> 20:27.663
And that (bleep) was with a P-H.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.627
