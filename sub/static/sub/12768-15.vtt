WEBVTT

00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.834 --> 00:09.291
(New Age music playing)

00:09.333 --> 00:11.709
THIS MUSIC, IT'S SO...

00:11.750 --> 00:13.709
(groans)

00:13.750 --> 00:16.083
IS THAT A REVIEW
OR A CONTRACTION?

00:16.125 --> 00:17.291
BOTH.

00:17.333 --> 00:18.625
(laughs)

00:18.667 --> 00:20.041
IT'S RESONANCE THERAPY.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.625
COMBINED WITH ACUPUNCTURE,

00:21.667 --> 00:24.000
IT'S GONNA GET THOSE
CONTRACTIONS UNDER CONTROL

00:24.041 --> 00:26.000
AND MAKE YOU FEEL
MORE COMFORTABLE.

00:26.041 --> 00:29.041
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING MATTHEW
COULDN'T MAKE IT TODAY...

00:29.083 --> 00:31.041
(singsongy)
BECAUSE HE WOULD HATE THIS.
IT'S SOOTHING.

00:31.083 --> 00:32.458
(laughs, normal voice)
OKAY.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.458
YOU KNOW, WHEN DR. BENNETT
DID THE I.V.F.,

00:34.500 --> 00:37.041
SHE LET US BRING IN
OUR OWN C.D.
WHAT'D YOU PUT ON?

00:37.083 --> 00:39.625
WELL, THE FIRST TIME WE JUST
PICKED ALL THESE SONGS

00:39.667 --> 00:41.625
THAT WE USED TO LOVE
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.625
AND THEN... (grunts)
THE SECOND TIME

00:43.667 --> 00:46.250
WE USED THIS MUZAK THAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO RELAX ME,

00:46.291 --> 00:49.000
BUT JUST MADE ME FEEL
LIKE I WAS HAVING

00:49.041 --> 00:51.375
A GYNECOLOGICAL APPOINTMENT
IN AN ELEVATOR.
(laughs)

00:51.417 --> 00:54.500
AND THEN THE THIRD TIME,
WE JUST PICKED EVERY SONG

00:54.542 --> 00:57.625
THAT WE COULD THINK OF WITH
THE WORD "LUCK" IN THE TITLE.
AND IT WORKED.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.041
(gasps) AH.
YOU OKAY?

00:59.083 --> 01:00.625
(exhales) DON'T WORRY.

01:00.667 --> 01:03.083
IT'S JUST--IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS
THE PAST COUPLE OF MORNINGS.

01:03.125 --> 01:06.000
I THINK BABY LANGSTON DOES NOT
LIKE BREAKFAST BURRITOS.

01:06.041 --> 01:09.500
OKAY. YOU START YOUR TORTURE,
AND I'LL JUST RUN A TUNE--AH!

01:09.542 --> 01:12.041
AH! OOH.
OKAY, HANG ON.

01:12.083 --> 01:13.709
SEND NAOMI IN, PLEASE.

01:13.750 --> 01:16.000
SORRY. IT'S NOT USUALLY
THIS BAD.

01:16.041 --> 01:18.000
MM.
OKAY,
FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING.

01:18.041 --> 01:19.875
OOH.
SLOW AND DEEP.

01:19.917 --> 01:22.000
SHIRA, WHAT'S WRONG?

01:22.041 --> 01:24.250
STRENGTHENING CONTRACTIONS,
A MINUTE APART.
OH!

01:24.291 --> 01:26.834
OH, THIS COULD BE REAL LABOR.
AT 25 WEEKS?

01:26.875 --> 01:29.291
(exhales)
CAN YOU MAKE IT STOP?
WELL, WE CAN,

01:29.333 --> 01:32.750
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.
(exhales) I'M ALL WET.

01:32.792 --> 01:35.959
I THINK MY WATER JUST BROKE.
(panting)

01:36.000 --> 01:38.041
IT'S BLOOD.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.000
(elevator bell dings)

01:42.083 --> 01:43.500
THANKS.

01:43.542 --> 01:45.083
HEY.
HEY.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.041
I WAS
JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU.

01:47.083 --> 01:49.709
OH, YEAH?
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO WEAR TO MAYA'S WEDDING.

01:49.750 --> 01:50.917
OH.

01:50.959 --> 01:53.041
UH... WHATEVER.

01:53.083 --> 01:55.667
SAM, WOMEN DON'T DO WELL
WITH "WHATEVER."

01:55.709 --> 01:59.875
(chuckles) WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA WEAR?

01:59.917 --> 02:01.291
(laughs) WHAT?

02:01.333 --> 02:04.000
UH, I HAVE A MILLION THINGS
TO DO TO GET READY,

02:04.041 --> 02:06.458
AND PICKING OUT A TIE IS NOT
HIGH UP ON THE LIST.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.375
WHAT IS HIGH ON THE LIST?

02:09.417 --> 02:11.375
I HAVE TO WRITE A TOAST.

02:11.417 --> 02:14.000
OH, I'M GOOD AT TOASTS.
YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW THAT.

02:14.041 --> 02:16.583
I-I KNOCKED ON YOUR DOOR
LAST NIGHT,

02:16.625 --> 02:19.041
HOPING THAT YOU COULD HELP...
BUT I-I WASN'T HOME.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.250
YEAH.

02:20.291 --> 02:23.041
LOOK, YOU, UH, YOU DON'T
WANT THIS TO BE WEIRD.

02:23.083 --> 02:25.375
AND--AND I'M TRYING
TO MAKE THIS NOT WEIRD.

02:25.417 --> 02:28.458
BUT, UH, YOU WEREN'T--
YOU WEREN'T HOME.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.583
YEAH. I WAS... OUT.

02:34.083 --> 02:36.125
LOOK, SAM,
I'M JUST GONNA SAY THIS,

02:36.166 --> 02:38.125
AND HOPEFULLY,
YOU'RE GONNA UNDERSTAND,

02:38.166 --> 02:41.583
AND IT WON'T BE WEIRD
AND...

02:41.625 --> 02:43.542
I'M SEEING SOMEONE.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.166
(door opens)

02:45.208 --> 02:47.000
(Pete) ADDISON.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.375
THERE'S AN AMBULANCE DOWNSTAIRS.
WE NEED YOU.

02:49.417 --> 02:51.208
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
IT'S A PLACENTAL ABRUPTION.
THIS MUCH BLOOD, THE PLACENTA
COULD BE COMPLETELY DETACHED.

02:59.041 --> 03:01.834
IT'S GONNA BE HARD
TO CONTROL THE HEMORRHAGE

03:01.875 --> 03:05.041
AND GET THAT BABY OUT
FAST ENOUGH.
OH, NO, PLEASE.
HE'S NOT READY YET.

03:05.083 --> 03:08.041
WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO KEEP THE BABY INSIDE.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.333
DO YOU HAVE ANY TERBUTALINE?
I DON'T KNOW IF WE DO.

03:10.375 --> 03:13.875
THE BOOK SAYS THAT HE'S
THE SIZE OF A CUCUMBER.
THERE'S NO TERBUTALINE,
NO MAGNESIUM SULFATE.

03:13.917 --> 03:16.041
CAN SHE MAKE IT?
I CAN ALREADY FEEL
THE BABY'S HEAD.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.250
NO, NO, PLEASE.
THIS BABY'S COMING NOW.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.959
NO!

03:20.000 --> 03:22.875
(grunting)

03:22.917 --> 03:27.125
(siren wailing)

03:27.166 --> 03:30.041
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU INTO SURGERY
AND GET YOUR BLEEDING STOPPED.

03:30.083 --> 03:32.041
YOUR HUSBAND'S ON HIS WAY.
THE BABY?

03:32.083 --> 03:34.458
DR. MONTGOMERY'S WITH HIM.
HE WAS SO SMALL.
WILL HE BE OKAY?

03:34.500 --> 03:37.375
SHE'S GONNA DO EVERYTHING
SHE CAN FOR HIM.
BUT WILL HE BE OKAY?

03:39.291 --> 03:41.291
I DIDN'T FEEL... ANYTHING

03:41.333 --> 03:44.917
'CAUSE THE DOCTOR...
AND I WAS COUNTING...

03:44.959 --> 03:48.291
THEY DIDN'T NICK HIS BRAIN
OR ANYTHING, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW, THEY GO IN
THROUGH THE GROIN

03:48.333 --> 03:50.291
FOR A HERNIA REPAIR,
SO I DOUBT IT.

03:50.333 --> 03:53.041
I JUST THINK IKE HAS A LITTLE
BIT OF AN ANESTHESIA HANGOVER.

03:53.083 --> 03:56.166
DR. SCOTT.
HEY. I'M SO SORRY, BUDDY.
THEY MADE ME SCRUB IN

03:56.208 --> 03:59.041
ON ANOTHER SURGERY
RIGHT AFTER YOURS.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.667
WASN'T NEARLY AS COOL,
THOUGH.
SO EVERYTHING WENT OKAY HERE?

04:01.709 --> 04:04.625
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
I SUTURED IN A MESH PATCH.

04:04.667 --> 04:07.041
GONNA LAST HIM A LIFETIME.
GREAT. SO HOW LONG IS HE
GONNA BE KINDA...

04:07.083 --> 04:09.834
OH, HE'LL BE HIMSELF
IN AN HOUR OR SO.
I AM MYSELF.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.250
LISTEN, JUST LET HIM,
UH, REST A WHILE.

04:12.291 --> 04:15.041
I'LL SWING BY AND CHECK HIM.

04:15.083 --> 04:17.959
YOU'RE GONNA BE OUTTA HERE
BEFORE DINNER.
THANK YOU.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.667
TAKE CARE.

04:19.709 --> 04:23.041
OH, MAN, I'LL TELL YOU.
I JACKED UP MY BACK. (groans)

04:23.083 --> 04:25.041
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.875
YEAH, I WAS PLAYING THAT,
UH, COMPUTER TENNIS GAME.

04:27.917 --> 04:30.083
I REALIZE
IT'S A GOOFY INJURY.

04:30.125 --> 04:32.083
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE LAST FEW DAYS

04:32.125 --> 04:34.500
I'VE BEEN, UH, EATING
FISTFULS OF IBUPROFEN

04:34.542 --> 04:36.750
JUST SO I CAN STAND UP
IN THE O.R.

04:36.792 --> 04:38.750
ACTUALLY, MAN,
WOULD YOU MIND, UH,

04:38.792 --> 04:41.500
WRITING ME A PRESCRIPTION
FOR A COUPLE OF OXY?

04:41.542 --> 04:44.500
OXY A LITTLE HEAVY
FOR A GAMING INJURY?
AH, IT'S JUST TWO OR THREE,

04:44.542 --> 04:46.500
JUST TO GET ME THROUGH
TODAY AND TOMORROW.

04:46.542 --> 04:50.041
THEN I'M GONNA TAKE
THE WEEKEND OFF AND REST UP.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.667
HEY, LISTEN, IF--IF--OW.

04:51.709 --> 04:55.041
IF IT'S A BIG DEAL,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.166
I'LL SUCK IT UP.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.291
(door opens and closes)

05:01.500 --> 05:03.041
HEY.

05:03.083 --> 05:04.041
HEY.

05:04.083 --> 05:06.291
YOU WANT
TO GRAB LUNCH LATER,

05:06.333 --> 05:09.041
AWAY FROM HERE?

05:09.083 --> 05:12.250
I CAN DO THAT.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.291
OH, HEY. YOU KNOW--

05:14.333 --> 05:16.083
YOU KNOW CHARLOTTE KING,
DON'T YOU?

05:16.125 --> 05:18.500
YEAH. (laughs)

05:18.542 --> 05:20.709
YEAH.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.041
OH, IS HE THE DOC THAT--

05:23.083 --> 05:25.500
YEAH.
OH, I SEE.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.500
I HOPE THIS ISN'T
GONNA BE A THING.
IT'S NOT A THING.

05:28.542 --> 05:31.291
OKAY. GREAT.

05:31.333 --> 05:34.375
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
MM.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.041
PROBLEM WITH THIS?

05:36.083 --> 05:38.500
NOT A THING.

05:38.542 --> 05:42.166
YOU DON'T RSVP TWO DAYS
BEFORE A WEDDING.

05:42.208 --> 05:45.083
I'M SORRY. MY FRIENDS
HAVE NEVER DONE THIS.

05:45.125 --> 05:47.834
YOU BETTER WATCH THAT TONE,
YOUNG--

05:47.875 --> 05:50.083
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA
TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

05:50.125 --> 05:52.083
I DON'T EVEN CARE
IF THEY COME.

05:52.125 --> 05:55.083
IF IT'S GONNA BE
THIS BIG A DEAL--
ENOUGH ABOUT THE WEDDING.

05:55.125 --> 05:58.875
WELL, IF YOU'RE DONE,
SHE HAS AN APPOINTMENT.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.834
(sighs)

06:05.583 --> 06:07.875
YOU OKAY?

06:07.917 --> 06:10.875
HE LOOKS LIKE HIS HEAD
IS ABOUT TO POP OFF.
DON'T TELL ANYBODY,
BUT AROUND HERE,

06:10.917 --> 06:13.875
IT ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE YOUR DAD'S
HEAD'S ABOUT TO POP OFF.

06:13.917 --> 06:17.750
I GUESS I SHOULD BE HAPPY
HE'S COMING AT ALL.
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR MOM.

06:17.792 --> 06:20.792
SHE'S MAKING ME FEEL LIKE
I'M DOING SOMETHING WRONG.
DID YOU TRY
TALKING TO HER AGAIN?

06:20.834 --> 06:24.041
WELL, YOU KNOW, I-I KNOW
HOW HARD THIS IS.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.458
I MEAN, I REMEMBER.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.500
YOU KNOW, HEATHER AND HER MOM,
THEY NEVER GOT PAST IT.

06:28.542 --> 06:32.417
BUT WITH YOUR MOM...
I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY AGAIN.
I DON'T THINK
MY DAD WOULD LIKE IT.

06:32.458 --> 06:36.500
HE'S MAD AT HER.
WELL, IT'S YOUR WEDDING, MAYA.

06:36.542 --> 06:38.000
(ventilator hissing)

06:38.041 --> 06:40.208
DOES HE REALLY NEED
ALL OF THAT?

06:40.250 --> 06:43.291
HE WEIGHS LESS THAN 2 POUNDS,
SO WE NEED TO KEEP HIM

06:43.333 --> 06:45.500
UNDER THE LIGHTS TO REGULATE
HIS BODY TEMPERATURE.

06:45.542 --> 06:47.041
WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO CORRECT

06:47.083 --> 06:49.041
A PRETTY SERIOUS
ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE

06:49.083 --> 06:50.875
THAT'S CAUSING CONVULSIONS

06:50.917 --> 06:53.458
AND EXACERBATING
A CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE.
HIS BRAIN IS BLEEDING?

06:53.500 --> 06:56.041
HOW CAN HE HAVE
SO MANY PROBLEMS?

06:56.083 --> 06:59.041
25 WEEKS IS JUST THE CUSP
OF VIABILITY.

06:59.083 --> 07:01.291
ADDISON, HIS ABDOMEN
IS DISTENDED.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.208
YEAH, WE DID AN X-RAY.

07:04.250 --> 07:08.000
HE HAS
NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.333
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.041
(Pete) IT MEANS THAT

07:14.083 --> 07:16.834
NOT ENOUGH BLOOD IS GETTING
TO HIS DIGESTIVE TRACT.

07:16.875 --> 07:19.834
HIS INTESTINES ARE DYING.
IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU CAN FIX?

07:19.875 --> 07:22.250
(Addison) HE'D NEED SURGERY

07:22.291 --> 07:26.125
TO TRY TO RESECT HIS BOWEL
AND SAVE SOME OF THE INTESTINES.

07:26.166 --> 07:27.709
MATTHEW.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.041
SO THIS SURGERY...
CAN WE DO IT NOW?

07:30.083 --> 07:33.000
UH, THAT'S UP TO
DR. MONTGOMERY.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.125
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND

07:37.166 --> 07:40.041
THAT IT WOULDN'T BE
JUST ONE SURGERY.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.542
THERE WOULD BE A WHOLE SERIES
OF SURGERIES.

07:42.583 --> 07:46.041
AND IN BETWEEN, HE WOULD NEED
TO EAT THROUGH A FEEDING TUBE

07:46.083 --> 07:49.041
AND BREATHE WITH THE HELP
OF A VENTILATOR.

07:49.083 --> 07:50.583
HE'D BE SUFFERING.

07:50.625 --> 07:53.458
AND EVEN IF WE DID MANAGE
TO KEEP HIM ALIVE,

07:53.500 --> 07:56.333
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT WE COULD GIVE
HIM ANY KIND OF NORMAL LIFE.

07:56.375 --> 08:00.083
YOU NEED TO CONSIDER IF... THIS
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT.

08:00.125 --> 08:01.500
(scoffs)

08:01.542 --> 08:03.375
WHAT'S OUR ALTERNATIVE?

08:05.125 --> 08:08.792
ENDING HIS LIFE?

08:08.834 --> 08:10.500
YES.

08:10.542 --> 08:12.542
(inhales sharply)

08:16.125 --> 08:19.041
THAT'S NOT A LIFE--
SHUTTLING BACK AND FORTH

08:19.083 --> 08:22.041
BETWEEN THE O.R. AND NICU,
BEING KEPT ALIVE BY MACHINES,

08:22.083 --> 08:24.041
HIS SYSTEM
OVERLOADED WITH DRUGS.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.542
HE'S THEIR CHILD,

08:25.583 --> 08:27.709
AND NONE OF US CAN SAY
WE KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

08:27.750 --> 08:30.041
ODDS ARE YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM RIGHT.

08:30.083 --> 08:33.083
THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE
SEVERE ENTEROCOLITIS RESOLVES.
SO YOU'RE ON THE SIDE
OF MIRACLES NOW?

08:33.125 --> 08:35.083
I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE,

08:35.125 --> 08:38.333
AND I'M NOT GONNA
FAULT THEM FOR IT.
I AM NOT FAULTING THEM,
BUT...

08:38.375 --> 08:39.959
THAT BABY IS SUFFERING.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.083
HE'S ONLY
A COUPLE OF HOURS OLD,

08:42.125 --> 08:44.250
AND YOU CAN ALREADY SEE IT
IN HIS FACE.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.208
YOU CAN HEAR IT IN HIS CRIES.
HE'S IN PAIN.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.250
LETTING GO IS NOT GIVING UP.
IT WOULD BE THEM

08:49.291 --> 08:53.667
PUTTING THE BABY'S BEST
INTERESTS AHEAD OF THEIR OWN.
NAOMI?

08:53.709 --> 08:56.250
YOU KNOW, KIDS DON'T COME
WITH GUARANTEES.

08:56.291 --> 08:58.250
THEY COME WITH PROBLEMS.

08:58.291 --> 08:59.875
THESE PROBLEMS
CAN'T BE SOLVED.

08:59.917 --> 09:01.875
A LOT OF PROBLEMS
CAN'T BE SOLVED.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.000
YOU JUST... YOU LEARN
TO LIVE WITH IT.

09:04.041 --> 09:06.250
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE
WITH THIS.

09:06.291 --> 09:09.041
NO, WE'RE NOT GONNA TELL
THE COLES WHAT TO DO.

09:09.083 --> 09:12.542
THEY HAVE TO DECIDE
WHAT THEY CAN LIVE WITH.
BUT I'D HAVE TO DO
THE SURGERY,

09:12.583 --> 09:15.166
SO I NEED TO DECIDE
WHAT I CAN LIVE WITH.

09:17.458 --> 09:20.375
CORINNE... HEY, WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:20.417 --> 09:23.208
OH, I TOLD MAYA I'D PICK
HER UP. SHE CAME IN TO DO--

09:23.250 --> 09:26.917
A PRENATAL APPOINTMENT.
YEAH, I KNOW.
I'M TAKING
MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW-TO-BE

09:26.959 --> 09:28.875
ON A MINI SPA DAY--
MASSAGE, FACIALS,

09:28.917 --> 09:31.917
AND THEN A TEST RUN
FOR HER MAKEUP AND HAIR.

09:31.959 --> 09:34.834
UH, I--
I'M JUST TRYING TO
MAKE THIS SPECIAL FOR MAYA.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.917
I THINK THE WEDDING
WILL BE SPECIAL ENOUGH.

09:36.959 --> 09:39.667
WELL, IF WE JUST GO THROUGH
THE MOTIONS,

09:39.709 --> 09:42.250
DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT WILL BE?

09:42.291 --> 09:44.834
I-I KNOW THIS ISN'T WHAT
YOU OR NAOMI WANTED.

09:44.875 --> 09:47.000
IT'S--IT'S NOT
WHAT I WANTED, EITHER,

09:47.041 --> 09:49.291
BUT IT'S
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

09:49.333 --> 09:52.041
SO I'VE MADE PEACE WITH IT
AS BEST I CAN,

09:52.083 --> 09:54.041
AND NOW I FEEL
WE SHOULD MAKE THIS

09:54.083 --> 09:57.041
AS POSITIVE AN EXPERIENCE
AS WE CAN FOR THE KIDS.

09:57.083 --> 10:00.208
SO IS MAYA HERE?

10:00.250 --> 10:03.208
IT'S NOT A THING,
BUT THE GUY'S A SURGEON.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.875
WHO'S DATING CHARLOTTE.
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE FACT

10:05.917 --> 10:07.875
THAT HE HIT ME UP
FOR A PRESCRIPTION.

10:07.917 --> 10:10.041
HE BARELY KNOWS ME,
AND HE'S ASKING ME FOR NARCOTICS

10:10.083 --> 10:13.041
THAT WOULD SLOW HIM DOWN,
IMPAIR HIS JUDGMENT.
WELL, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.
I AM ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.291
SOMETIMES IT MAKES IT HARD
TO FOCUS, WHICH IS NOT IDEAL

10:15.333 --> 10:18.041
WHEN I'M IN THERAPY.
SAM'S ON ALLERGY MEDS.

10:18.083 --> 10:20.750
WHEN HE UPS HIS DOSE,
IT KNOCKS HIM OUT.

10:20.792 --> 10:23.125
YOU JUST HAVE TO HOPE THAT
SOMEONE'S GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE.

10:23.166 --> 10:26.125
DO--DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO
THINK THAT SCOTT WOULDN'T BE?
NOTHING CONCRETE,

10:26.166 --> 10:28.375
BUT WHEN HE SAW
THAT I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE,

10:28.417 --> 10:32.041
HE BACKED OFF FAST,
AND IT FELT PRACTICED.
WELL, HE--I'VE HEARD
HE'S A GOOD SURGEON.

10:32.083 --> 10:34.583
HE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD GUY.
WHAT, YOU'VE MET HIM?

10:34.625 --> 10:36.583
OH, SHE HAD HIM TO THE HOUSE,
DIDN'T SHE?

10:36.625 --> 10:39.291
MY GOD, SHE GIVES IT UP FAST.
COOPER, Y--

10:39.333 --> 10:42.875
WHAT, WHAT, AM I WRONG?
(stammers) HE HAS NOT ACTUALLY
BEEN TO THE HOUSE.

10:42.917 --> 10:45.166
HE'S JUST...
PICKED HER UP THERE.

10:45.208 --> 10:47.750
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT THEY'RE--

10:47.792 --> 10:51.083
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE JUST
SAYING THAT TO BE NICE.
BUT SHE IS BRINGING HIM
TO MAYA'S WEDDING.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.041
HE'S HER PLUS ONE.
I HAVE THE LIST.

10:53.083 --> 10:55.417
I HAVE ALL THE LISTS--
CATERERS, DEEJAYS, FLORISTS.

10:55.458 --> 10:57.375
I AM KNEE-DEEP IN WEDDING,

10:57.417 --> 11:00.458
AND THE SAD PART IS, I HAVE
NEVER HAD ONE OF MY OWN.
THAT IS SAD, BUT BACK TO ME.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.917
NO ONE TOLD ME THAT PLUS ONE
WAS AN OPTION.

11:02.959 --> 11:05.041
COOPER, THE WEDDING
IS IN TWO DAYS.

11:05.083 --> 11:08.291
IF YOU ARE THINKING OF
SCARING UP SOME RANDOM HOOCHIE--
OH, NO, I'M THINKING ABOUT
INVITING JORDANA SAMPSON.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.375
IS SHE BACK IN TOWN?

11:10.417 --> 11:13.041
MM-HMM.
(chuckles) COOPER, NO.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.041
SHE'S NOT RANDOM
AND SHE'S NOT A HOOCHIE.
(laughs) I KNOW, BUT SHE'S--

11:16.083 --> 11:18.083
EXACTLY.

11:18.125 --> 11:20.083
YOU DIDN'T TAKE THAT
PERSONALLY, DID YOU?

11:20.125 --> 11:22.083
IS THERE A REASON I SHOULD?
NO, NO.

11:22.125 --> 11:24.041
THEN I WON'T.
ME EITHER.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.583
IT'S
A PROFESSIONAL DISAGREEMENT.

11:25.625 --> 11:28.166
YES.

11:30.166 --> 11:33.041
SO... ARE YOU
STILL GOOD WITH...

11:33.083 --> 11:35.041
YES. I THINK SO.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.625
I DON'T KNOW.

11:36.667 --> 11:40.250
I TOLD SAM THIS MORNING
THAT I WAS SEEING SOMEONE.

11:40.291 --> 11:43.041
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T GONNA--
NO, WE'RE NOT. IT'S JUST--

11:43.083 --> 11:45.583
HE CAME TO MY HOUSE LAST NIGHT.
I WASN'T HOME.

11:45.625 --> 11:48.583
I DIDN'T WANT TO LIE TO HIM.
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM
IT WAS ME?

11:48.625 --> 11:50.041
NO, NO.

11:50.083 --> 11:53.041
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE,
HAVE YOU, LIKE VIOLET?

11:53.083 --> 11:57.041
I... I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

11:57.083 --> 12:00.041
BECAUSE... THIS...

12:00.083 --> 12:01.041
MM-HMM.

12:01.083 --> 12:03.291
WITH US...

12:03.333 --> 12:04.500
MM-HMM.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.041
WE'RE JUST...

12:06.083 --> 12:09.041
JUST GETTING THROUGH
WHAT WE'RE GETTING THROUGH.

12:09.083 --> 12:11.375
MM-HMM. WE'RE JUST
HELPING EACH OTHER...
MM.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.375
HELPING EACH OTHER FEEL GOOD.

12:13.417 --> 12:16.041
REALLY... REALLY GOOD.

12:16.083 --> 12:20.750
WANT TO SEE
IF THAT DOOR LOCKS?

12:28.750 --> 12:31.041
MAYA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.083
I WANT YOU
TO COME TO MY WEDDING.

12:33.125 --> 12:36.417
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT PROUD
OF ME, I KNOW YOU LOVE ME.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.041
OF COURSE I LOVE YOU.

12:38.083 --> 12:41.625
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF I DIDN'T GET MARRIED?
YES.

12:41.667 --> 12:45.041
I-I... I DON'T KNOW.
IT WOULDN'T.

12:45.083 --> 12:49.083
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING, BUT I NEED YOU.
YOU NEEDED ME
LONG BEFORE THIS,

12:49.125 --> 12:51.625
BUT SOMEHOW, EVEN THOUGH
I TRIED, I WASN'T THERE FOR YOU.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.625
AND SO FOR ME TO SIT DOWN

12:53.667 --> 12:55.625
IN FRONT OF GOD
AND EVERYONE WE KNOW

12:55.667 --> 12:57.500
FOR A FORMAL, PUBLIC REMINDER

12:57.542 --> 13:00.542
OF HOW BADLY I SCREWED UP
YOUR LIFE, I--
THAT'S NOT
WHAT MY WEDDING IS.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.792
THAT'S WHAT
IT WOULD BE TO ME.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.750
THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE
TRYING TO GET PREGNANT,

13:15.792 --> 13:18.458
MATTHEW KEPT TELLING ME TO
VISUALIZE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

13:18.500 --> 13:21.458
WHEN WE WERE IN THE HOSPITAL,
WHEN WE WERE FINALLY A FAMILY.
YEAH.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.041
AFTER A WHILE,
I-I WANTED TO STOP.

13:24.083 --> 13:26.041
IT'S JUST TOO HARD,
YOU KNOW?

13:26.083 --> 13:28.250
AND IT JUST FELT LIKE
IT WAS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

13:28.291 --> 13:31.041
BUT MATTHEW... (sighs)
HE KEPT PROMISING IT WOULD.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.125
HE CALLED THE BABY
"OUR DREAM DEFERRED."

13:33.166 --> 13:36.000
OH, LIKE THE POEM.

13:36.041 --> 13:37.375
LANGSTON HUGHES.
YEAH.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.542
WE'RE ENGLISH TEACHERS.

13:39.583 --> 13:42.333
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:42.375 --> 13:45.166
CAN I--CAN I HOLD HIM NOW?

13:45.208 --> 13:48.417
OH, WE CAN'T--
WE CAN'T TAKE HIM OUT.

13:48.458 --> 13:51.000
EVEN FOR A MINUTE?
I'M SORRY.

13:51.041 --> 13:53.041
SO HOW SOON
CAN WE DO THIS SURGERY?

13:53.083 --> 13:54.542
(Pete) I TOLD MATTHEW,

13:54.583 --> 13:57.208
AT THE RATE THE BABY'S BOWEL
FUNCTION IS DETERIORATING,

13:57.250 --> 13:59.917
YOU'D HAVE TO DO
THE OPERATION TODAY, RIGHT?

13:59.959 --> 14:02.792
IT'S WHAT THEY WANT
FOR THEIR CHILD,

14:02.834 --> 14:06.208
AND I TOLD THEM, IF ANYBODY
CAN HELP THEM HERE, IT'S YOU.

14:06.250 --> 14:09.041
(Shira) DR. MONTGOMERY...

14:09.083 --> 14:11.208
PLEASE.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.375
I'LL BOOK AN O.R.

14:15.417 --> 14:18.375
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DISCHARGE IKE
ALMOST TWO HOURS AGO.

14:18.417 --> 14:21.041
WE KEPT PAGING HIM.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

14:21.083 --> 14:24.041
I SAID DR. SCOTT
WAS PROBABLY BUSY

14:24.083 --> 14:27.041
SEWING SOMEONE'S BRAINS
BACK IN.
WELL, THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AN EMERGENCY

14:27.083 --> 14:30.041
WHERE HE WAS SEWING
SOMEBODY'S SOMETHING BACK IN.
STILL--

14:30.083 --> 14:33.375
NO, I--HE SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT
YOU HANGING. I'M REALLY SORRY.

14:33.417 --> 14:36.458
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE ALL SET TO GO.
I HOPE THAT FOLLOW-UP
IS THE ONLY THING

14:36.500 --> 14:38.583
THAT HE'S CARELESS ABOUT.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.417
I HEARD THERE WAS
A PROBLEM WITH YOUR PATIENT.

14:42.458 --> 14:45.041
NO. ACTUALLY, THERE'S
A PROBLEM WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.834
HE ASKED ME FOR OXY
THIS MORNING, NOW HE'S M.I.A.

14:47.875 --> 14:50.417
AND YOU'RE ASSUMING WHAT?

14:50.458 --> 14:52.875
HE HAS A BAD BACK.
WELL, AS HIS GIRLFRIEND,

14:52.917 --> 14:54.250
I'M SURE
YOU'RE VERY SYMPATHETIC.

14:54.291 --> 14:56.834
BUT AS CHIEF OF STAFF
OF THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WORKS,

14:56.875 --> 14:58.709
I THINK
YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED

14:58.750 --> 15:00.750
ABOUT HOW HE'S TREATING IT...
IF IT'S HIS BACK.

15:00.792 --> 15:04.041
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE
A FORMAL COMPLAINT, DO IT.

15:04.083 --> 15:07.166
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

15:07.208 --> 15:10.208
(footsteps approach)

15:11.667 --> 15:12.834
HEY.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.875
HEY.

15:14.917 --> 15:16.250
YOU WORKING ON THE TOAST?

15:16.291 --> 15:19.041
(chuckles) TRYING.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.041
LOOK, SAM,
ABOUT WHAT I SAID--

15:21.083 --> 15:24.041
WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT.
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS--
NO, SAM--

15:24.083 --> 15:26.041
ADDISON, PLEASE.
NOT TODAY, OKAY?

15:26.083 --> 15:29.291
I-I C--I CAN BARELY
GET THROUGH THIS.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.709
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY?

15:31.750 --> 15:33.750
I WANT TO TELL THEM STOP,

15:33.792 --> 15:35.750
YOU KNOW,
AND DON'T MAKE THIS ANY WORSE.

15:35.792 --> 15:37.875
I JUST TRIED
TO GIVE THAT SPEECH.

15:37.917 --> 15:40.542
A PATIENT OF PETE'S
GAVE BIRTH TO A PREEMIE--

15:40.583 --> 15:44.542
25 WEEKS, JUST... (sighs)
SO MANY PROBLEMS.

15:44.583 --> 15:47.041
BEST-CASE SCENARIO,
IT LIVES IN THE NICU

15:47.083 --> 15:49.875
UNTIL I CAN'T DO
ANY MORE SURGERIES

15:49.917 --> 15:53.041
OR GIVE IT ANY MORE DRUGS.
ARE YOU AND PETE IN SYNC?

15:53.083 --> 15:55.083
YOU SAID
IT WAS PETE'S PATIENT, RIGHT?

15:55.125 --> 15:57.041
RIGHT. IT IS.

15:57.083 --> 15:58.667
BUT WE'RE NOT IN SYNC.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.750
I AM A-ABOUT TO GO REMOVE

16:00.792 --> 16:02.667
MOST OF THE BABY'S
INTESTINAL TRACT

16:02.709 --> 16:04.959
BECAUSE THE PARENTS
ARE HOPING FOR A MIRACLE,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.542
AND PETE DOESN'T WANT
TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM,

16:07.583 --> 16:09.542
AND I COULDN'T SAY NO.

16:09.583 --> 16:12.542
SO I GOTTA CLEAR MY SCHEDULE
AND HEAD BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.

16:12.583 --> 16:16.041
WELL, I GET THAT--DOING THINGS
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.458
I'M SUPPOSED TO MAKE
THIS BIG SPEECH

16:18.500 --> 16:21.458
THAT MAKES EVERYBODY
FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE WEDDING...

16:21.500 --> 16:23.792
PRETEND LIKE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

16:23.834 --> 16:26.417
SOMETIMES
WE HAVE TO PRETEND.

16:29.375 --> 16:31.333
(elevator bell dings)

16:31.375 --> 16:34.041
(indistinct conversations)

16:34.083 --> 16:36.000
ELOPING?

16:36.041 --> 16:39.041
OH. NO, NO. I'M JUST TAKING
THE DRESS TO GET STEAMED.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.041
IT'S--IT'S MAYA'S.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.625
I FIGURED.

16:42.667 --> 16:45.834
YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT SHOULD BE A PRETTY ODD EVENT.

16:45.875 --> 16:49.417
YOU KNOW, UH, COOPER'S BRINGING
JORDANA SAMPSON.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.125
SHE'S BACK?

16:51.166 --> 16:53.041
OH, WOW.
I KNOW.

16:53.083 --> 16:55.333
Y-YOU'RE NOT BRINGING
SOMEONE ELSE ARE YOU,

16:55.375 --> 16:57.041
A-A PLUS ONE?

16:57.083 --> 17:00.041
UH, BECAUSE AMONG OTHER THINGS,
I'M THE RSVP GIRL,

17:00.083 --> 17:02.083
SO, UM, I'M JUST,
UH, MAKING SURE.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.458
NOPE. JUST ME. YOU?

17:04.500 --> 17:06.000
SAME.

17:07.875 --> 17:10.000
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

17:17.250 --> 17:20.667
HEY. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
DISCHARGE IKE HOLDEN.

17:20.709 --> 17:23.041
I HAD TO COME OVER HERE
JUST SO THEY COULD GO HOME.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.041
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
IT'S MY... MY BACK.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.041
IT WAS KILLING ME.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.959
I-I LAID DOWN.
I GUESS I JUST WENT OUT.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.458
COME ON.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.250
YOU THINK BECAUSE I ASKED YOU
FOR A-A COURTESY PRESCRIPTION,

17:35.291 --> 17:37.291
WHAT, YOU THINK NOW
I'M--I'M A DRUG ADDICT

17:37.333 --> 17:39.834
WHO CRASHED OUT HERE?
TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T
TAKEN ANYTHING.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.667
I-I TOOK ONE OXY.

17:41.709 --> 17:44.083
I DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER SURGERIES SCHEDULED.
OH, THAT'S THE LINE?

17:44.125 --> 17:46.041
AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT
CUTTING SOMEONE OPEN,

17:46.083 --> 17:48.041
ANYTHING SHORT OF THAT,

17:48.083 --> 17:50.375
IT'S OKAY THAT YOU
SHOW UP HERE LIKE THIS?
LISTEN, I'M REALLY SORRY

17:50.417 --> 17:53.000
THAT IT BOTHERS YOU THAT I'M
SEEING YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND.
IT BOTHERS ME

17:53.041 --> 17:55.875
THAT YOU COULDN'T DO YOUR JOB
RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE STILL HERE.
I HAVE NEVER HAD
A SINGLE PROBLEM,

17:55.917 --> 17:59.375
IN THIS HOSPITAL
OR ANY OTHER.
YOU WANT THAT TO CHANGE?

17:59.417 --> 18:01.917
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

18:03.834 --> 18:07.041
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO TALK
TO MY COLLEAGUE--VIOLET TURNER.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.667
SHE HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
TREATING PEOPLE WITH ADDICTION--

18:09.709 --> 18:11.667
(scoffs)
YOU WANT ME TO SEE A SHRINK?

18:11.709 --> 18:14.250
CONVINCE HER YOU DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM, I WILL LAY OFF.

18:14.291 --> 18:17.250
AND IF I DON'T?
WE WILL LET
THIS HOSPITAL SORT IT OUT.

18:17.291 --> 18:18.875
YOU KNOW,

18:18.917 --> 18:21.458
SOMEHOW I THINK CHARLOTTE'S
ALREADY DECIDED ABOUT ME.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.041
MAYBE, BUT I HAVEN'T.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.291
(sighs)

18:25.333 --> 18:29.250
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:29.291 --> 18:30.917
HOW'S IT GOING?

18:32.875 --> 18:35.041
ADDISON?

18:35.083 --> 18:36.667
ADDISON?

18:36.709 --> 18:38.959
THERE ARE NO CLEAR MARGINS.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.291
THE ENTIRE BOWEL
IS INVOLVED?

18:41.333 --> 18:43.959
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
I CAN SAVE.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.959
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN DO?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.041
I CAN CLOSE HIM UP.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.667
BUT HE SURVIVED
THE SURGERY.
YES, HE SURVIVED, BUT--

18:58.709 --> 19:01.250
THEN THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

19:01.291 --> 19:04.000
YOUR BABY DOESN'T HAVE
A FUNCTIONING DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.

19:04.041 --> 19:06.041
SO BEFORE
I COULD DO ANYTHING,

19:06.083 --> 19:08.041
I'D HAVE TO PUT
A CENTRAL LINE IN

19:08.083 --> 19:11.333
THROUGH HIS STOMACH
TO FEED HIM.

19:11.375 --> 19:14.083
AND HOW LONG WOULD HE
HAVE TO HAVE THAT?
PERMANENTLY.

19:14.125 --> 19:17.041
AND ALTHOUGH I WAS ABLE
TO STOP THE CEREBRAL BLEED,

19:17.083 --> 19:19.542
WE HAVE TO ASSUME
THAT THERE IS

19:19.583 --> 19:22.500
AT LEAST
MODERATE BRAIN DAMAGE.
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR SURE.

19:22.542 --> 19:25.041
NO, I DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR SURE.

19:25.083 --> 19:27.041
BUT IT'S MORE THAN LIKELY
THE CASE.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.834
JUST LIKE THE LONGER
WE KEEP HIM ON A RESPIRATOR,

19:29.875 --> 19:31.208
THE MORE LIKELY IT IS

19:31.250 --> 19:34.041
THAT HE'LL HAVE RETINAL FAILURE
OR THAT HE'LL GO BLIND.

19:34.083 --> 19:36.709
I'M NOT SAYING
THERE AREN'T MIRACLES,

19:36.750 --> 19:39.417
BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT,
IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE BABY--

19:39.458 --> 19:43.000
TO LANGSTON--
TO KEEP WAITING FOR THEM.

19:43.041 --> 19:44.375
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.834
I WANT TO KNOW THE ODDS.

19:46.875 --> 19:51.542
OF A BABY LIKE LANGSTON
LIVING OUTSIDE THE NICU?

19:51.583 --> 19:53.375
LESS THAN 1%.

19:53.417 --> 19:56.125
BUT IT COULD HAPPEN?

19:56.166 --> 19:58.333
AND IT'S OUR DECISION?

19:58.375 --> 20:01.041
UH, YEAH, IT IS.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.333
BUT HE'S IN PAIN.

20:03.375 --> 20:05.959
AND WITH SO LITTLE
TO HOPE FOR, I'M SORRY,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
PERFORMING ANOTHER SURGERY.

20:09.041 --> 20:13.417
ARE THERE OTHER DOCTORS
THAT WE CAN GET TO HELP US?

20:13.458 --> 20:16.583
YES, YOU COULD FIND SOMEONE ELSE
TO PUT IN A CENTRAL LINE.

20:16.625 --> 20:18.625
THEN THAT'S
WHAT WE'LL DO.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.333
(crying)
WILL YOU PLEASE HELP US?

20:22.375 --> 20:24.625
I'M SORRY.

20:24.667 --> 20:28.166
I UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANT
TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY,

20:28.208 --> 20:30.250
BUT I CAN'T.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.041
SO ARE THE--
ARE THE DRUGS SOMETHING NEW?

20:38.083 --> 20:39.792
(laughs) "THE DRUGS".

20:39.834 --> 20:42.291
THE DRUGS
ARE THE OCCASIONAL OXY

20:42.333 --> 20:45.375
THAT I TAKE
WHEN MY BACK FLARES UP.

20:45.417 --> 20:48.709
YOU KNOW WHAT? HERE YOU GO.

20:48.750 --> 20:51.375
TAKE 'EM, TOSS 'EM,
EAT 'EM.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.875
DO WHATEVER.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.709
THAT TELL YOU
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW?
UH, WELL,

20:55.750 --> 20:57.834
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE CARRYING
NARCOTICS IN YOUR POCKET

20:57.875 --> 21:01.000
TELLS ME THAT YOU MAY HAVE
A MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM

21:01.041 --> 21:03.625
THAN YOU'RE ADMITTING.
IT'S FUNNY HOW MUCH YOU SOUND
LIKE YOUR BUDDY COOPER.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.625
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH HIM.
THIS HAS EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH HIM.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.500
HE RESENTS
MY DATING CHARLOTTE.

21:08.542 --> 21:10.500
HE CAN'T SERIOUSLY
CALL INTO QUESTION MY JUDGMENT

21:10.542 --> 21:13.083
OR MY HAND SKILLS
OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT MATTERS.

21:13.125 --> 21:16.041
SO HE'S TRYING TO MAKE ME OUT
TO BE SOME KIND OF JUNKIE,

21:16.083 --> 21:19.041
AND YOU'RE HELPING HIM.
I'M JUST ASKING QUESTIONS,
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

21:19.083 --> 21:21.875
AND I'M CERTAINLY
NOT FORCING YOU TO STAY HERE.
NO, COOPER IS.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.875
YOU'RE FREE TO LEAVE.
I DO THAT, HE MAKES AN ISSUE
OF IT WITH CHARLOTTE.

21:24.917 --> 21:28.959
DOES THAT WORRY YOU,
CHARLOTTE KNOWING ABOUT THIS?
I'M NOT AN ADDICT!

21:36.583 --> 21:39.959
WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.333
I DON'T KNOW.

21:41.375 --> 21:43.291
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN
KEEP TALKING,

21:43.333 --> 21:46.041
FIND OUT
IF THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.
I'M A GOOD DOCTOR.

21:46.083 --> 21:48.917
WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULD ALSO
STOP SEEING PATIENTS

21:48.959 --> 21:52.291
UNTIL WE GET A HANDLE ON THIS,
WHATEVER IT IS.
AND HOW DO I EXPLAIN THAT,

21:52.333 --> 21:54.959
TO CHARLOTTE,
TO THE DOCTORS WHO REFER ME,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.125
THE PATIENTS
I ALREADY HAVE SCHEDULED?

21:57.166 --> 22:01.041
IT WILL BE EASIER THAN TRYING
TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED

22:01.083 --> 22:03.792
IF YOU HURT SOMEONE.

22:05.834 --> 22:09.583
I CAN HELP YOU
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

22:15.041 --> 22:17.041
OKAY.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.583
(knock on door)

22:19.625 --> 22:21.000
HEY.

22:21.041 --> 22:22.125
HEY.

22:22.166 --> 22:25.041
I CALLED YOU LAST NIGHT.
OH, SORRY.

22:25.083 --> 22:28.291
NO, NO, NO, I JUST WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOU AFTER YOU WALKED OUT.

22:28.333 --> 22:30.959
I'M OKAY.
OKAY.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.333
WELL, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I AGREE WITH YOU.

22:34.375 --> 22:36.500
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

22:36.542 --> 22:39.041
(blows air) YEAH.

22:39.083 --> 22:41.333
ADDISON--
(singsongy) NO. NO, NO.

22:41.375 --> 22:44.375
WHAT?
(normal voice)
NOT IN MY OFFICE.

22:44.417 --> 22:48.125
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE A FRIEND.
WELL, JUST, YOU KNOW,
BE A FRIEND FROM THERE.

22:48.166 --> 22:49.792
WILL THIS HELP?

22:52.625 --> 22:55.041
HEY, SAM,
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

22:55.083 --> 22:57.583
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE WEDDING.

22:57.625 --> 23:00.041
UH, TALK TO VIOLET.
NO, NO,
IT'S NOT A VIOLET THING.

23:00.083 --> 23:02.041
NOT NOW.
NO, NOW, SAM.

23:02.083 --> 23:05.041
LOOK, I-I GET THAT THIS
IS HARD FOR YOU, OKAY?

23:05.083 --> 23:07.041
BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

23:07.083 --> 23:09.208
THAT MAYA'S
GONNA GET MARRIED TOMORROW,

23:09.250 --> 23:11.834
AND YOU SIGNED THE PAPER
SO THAT SHE COULD,

23:11.875 --> 23:14.834
AND NOW YOU'RE MAKING HER
FEEL LIKE CRAP ABOUT IT.
I WILL BE THERE AT THE WEDDING.
I WILL WALK HER DOWN THE AISLE.

23:14.875 --> 23:17.041
OKAY, BUT SHOWING UP
AND ACTING LIKE THIS?

23:17.083 --> 23:19.166
I MEAN, IT'S NO BETTER
THAN WHAT NAOMI'S DOING.

23:19.208 --> 23:21.583
AND SOMEONE HAS TO BE THERE
FOR HER, TO BE HAPPY FOR HER,

23:21.625 --> 23:25.208
TO--TO SUPPORT HER, AND IF
IT'S NOT EITHER OF YOU--
I'M TRYING.

23:25.250 --> 23:27.250
(sighs) TRY HARDER.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.291
OH, HEY.
WHERE YOU GOING?

23:33.333 --> 23:36.417
I AM GOING TO PICK UP
MAYA AND DINK'S WEDDING RINGS.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.417
IT'S JUST ANOTHER THING
THAT I CAN CHECK OFF

23:38.458 --> 23:42.166
THIS LIST OF ERRANDS I NEVER
THOUGHT I WOULD DO FOR ANYBODY.

23:42.208 --> 23:43.792
HEY, UH, BEFORE YOU GO...

23:43.834 --> 23:46.041
SO SHOULD I BE WORRIED
ABOUT SCOTT OR...

23:46.083 --> 23:49.625
IF I THOUGHT HE WAS DANGEROUS,
I WOULD REPORT HIM.

23:49.667 --> 23:51.792
THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA SAY.

23:54.792 --> 23:56.125
WHAT?

23:56.166 --> 23:58.041
WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME?

23:58.083 --> 23:59.125
NO.
NO.

23:59.166 --> 24:01.041
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SCOTT.

24:01.083 --> 24:03.333
LOOK, I AM NOT GONNA SAY
ANYTHING TO EITHER ONE OF YOU.
AND YOU SHOULDN'T.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.709
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU CARE
ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY

24:05.750 --> 24:08.083
OF ANY OF THE PATIENTS
HE MIGHT TREAT AT THE HOSPITAL

24:08.125 --> 24:11.542
WHERE HE WORKS,
CUTTING THEM OPEN.
WHICH, ROUGHLY TRANSLATED, MEANS
"PLEASE, VIOLATE PRIVILEGE

24:11.583 --> 24:14.959
TO GIVE ME SOME DIRT
ON MY EX's NEW MAN."
I-I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOU AND HIM.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.542
I DO CARE THAT HE'S

24:16.583 --> 24:18.959
PROBABLY SMART ENOUGH NOT TO
TRIGGER VIOLET'S DUTY TO REPORT,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.375
WHICH MEANS HE'S GONNA
HAVE TO HURT SOMEONE

24:21.417 --> 24:24.959
BEFORE ANYONE
TAKES ACTION HERE.
I'M--I'M NOT GETTING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.750
(cell phone ringing)
YOU KNOW WHO NEEDS
THERAPY HERE? YOU.

24:27.792 --> 24:30.125
COOPER FREEDMAN.

24:30.166 --> 24:32.125
YEAH, IKE HOLDEN
IS MY PATIENT.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.375
WHAT HAPPENED?

24:34.417 --> 24:37.291
AND WHO'S DOING
THE SURGERY?

24:44.333 --> 24:46.333
SAM.

24:49.625 --> 24:51.417
HOW'S MAYA DOING?

24:51.458 --> 24:54.041
HOW DO YOU THINK
SHE'S DOING?

24:54.083 --> 24:55.709
SHE'S GETTING MARRIED
TOMORROW,

24:55.750 --> 24:58.041
AND YOU'RE
NOT GONNA BE THERE.

24:58.083 --> 25:00.583
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA BE?

25:00.625 --> 25:02.417
I'M GOING TO...

25:02.458 --> 25:05.041
I'M GOING TO NAPA...

25:05.083 --> 25:07.041
WITH WILLIAM.

25:07.083 --> 25:09.417
WOW.
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND--

25:09.458 --> 25:11.041
OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND.

25:11.083 --> 25:13.417
YOU THINK I DON'T WANT
TO DO THE SAME THING,

25:13.458 --> 25:16.083
JUST RUN AWAY
FROM ALL THIS?

25:16.125 --> 25:19.625
BUT I CAN'T, BECAUSE SOMEONE
HAS TO BE THE ADULT HERE.

25:19.667 --> 25:21.625
AND YOU LEFT THAT TO ME.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.041
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THIS
TO BE LIKE THIS, SAM.
JUST LIKE
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MEAN

25:24.083 --> 25:26.792
FOR MAYA TO START GOING
TO CORINNE WITH HER PROBLEMS

25:26.834 --> 25:28.166
OR FOR CORINNE TO BE

25:28.208 --> 25:30.041
THE ONE SHE WANTS AROUND
WHEN THE BABY COMES,

25:30.083 --> 25:32.250
AND THEN IN A LITTLE WHILE
FOR CORINNE TO BE THE ONE

25:32.291 --> 25:34.375
SHE STARTS SEEING
AS HER FAMILY.

25:34.417 --> 25:37.041
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

25:37.083 --> 25:39.041
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

25:39.083 --> 25:43.583
SO GROW UP. DO YOUR JOB.
BE A MOTHER.

25:54.083 --> 25:56.458
NOW WHAT?

25:56.500 --> 25:58.500
(Cooper) TELL ME YOU ARE NOT
DOING THIS SURGERY.

25:58.542 --> 26:00.250
IKE HAS SIGNIFICANT ISCHEMIA.

26:00.291 --> 26:02.166
IF I DON'T RESTORE
THE BLOOD SUPPLY, HE COULD DIE.

26:02.208 --> 26:04.917
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S
TOLD YOU, BUT THIS HAPPENS

26:04.959 --> 26:06.709
IN A SMALL PERCENTAGE
OF HERNIA REPAIRS.

26:06.750 --> 26:09.917
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
THE MEDICINE TO ME.

26:09.959 --> 26:13.041
JUST TELL ME IF YOU'VE
TAKEN ANYTHING TODAY.
YOU'RE KIDDING.

26:13.083 --> 26:16.834
YOU DO REALIZE
YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND HAS ISSUES?
TELL ME THERE'S NOTHING
IN YOUR SYSTEM.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.875
NO OXY, NOTHING.
(turns water on)

26:18.917 --> 26:22.041

29:15.083 --> 29:16.667
BE HAPPY FOR ME.

29:16.709 --> 29:19.083
I AM. I AM.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.959
HONESTLY?

29:21.000 --> 29:23.667
HONESTLY, I'M--
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED.

29:23.709 --> 29:26.500
BUT IF THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANT--
I DO.

29:26.542 --> 29:29.750
OKAY, WELL, THEN YOU NEED
TO KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU,

29:29.792 --> 29:31.458
I WILL ALWAYS BE HERE,

29:31.500 --> 29:34.417
AND THAT I'M GONNA HELP YOU
MAKE SURE THAT ULTIMATELY,

29:34.458 --> 29:37.041
THIS IS GONNA BE WONDERFUL.

29:37.083 --> 29:38.333
OKAY?

29:39.792 --> 29:42.041
OKAY?

29:42.083 --> 29:45.000

29:47.125 --> 29:49.041
HEY.

29:49.083 --> 29:50.917
HOW'S SCOTT?

29:50.959 --> 29:53.000
TRYING TO GET BETTER.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.709
CHECKED HIMSELF IN
SOMEWHERE LAST NIGHT.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.542
I HOPE HE DOES. I DO.

29:57.583 --> 30:00.291
YOU WANT TO SAY
I TOLD YOU SO.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.792
BUT I WON'T.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.792
LIFE'S HARD.
YOU SHOULDN'T JUDGE.

30:04.834 --> 30:07.291
EVERYBODY NEEDS
SOME KIND OF A CRUTCH.

30:11.166 --> 30:13.041
(clears throat)

30:13.083 --> 30:14.583
SO I DON'T WIND UP

30:14.625 --> 30:18.041

TEXTING THE WHOLE TIME,

30:18.083 --> 30:19.959
WOULD YOU MIND IF I...

30:20.000 --> 30:22.750
DON'T BE AN ASS, COOPER.
MAKE ROOM FOR THE GIRL.

30:22.792 --> 30:24.583
HI, I'M JORDANA SAMPSON.

30:26.667 --> 30:28.000
HERE.

30:43.250 --> 30:45.000
I CAN'T.

30:47.041 --> 30:51.542
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU
WANT SOMETHING SO BADLY...

30:51.583 --> 30:55.959
AND YOU GET IT...

30:56.000 --> 30:59.041
EVEN IF IT'S ONLY
FOR A MINUTE...

30:59.083 --> 31:01.667
YOU DON'T WANT TO LET GO.

31:01.709 --> 31:03.250
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

31:03.291 --> 31:04.875
IT COULD CHANGE.

31:04.917 --> 31:06.542
I MEAN, HE COULD...

31:06.583 --> 31:08.333
HE COULD GET BETTER.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.125
YOU'RE HURTING HIM,

31:10.166 --> 31:12.125
AND YOUR JOB AS A PARENT

31:12.166 --> 31:15.000
IS TO MAKE SURE
THAT NOTHING HURTS HIM.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.417
I LOVE HIM.

31:28.375 --> 31:30.000
THEN LET HIM GO.

31:34.250 --> 31:36.667
I THOUGHT...

31:36.709 --> 31:38.083

31:38.125 --> 31:40.083

I THOUGHT SHE'D BE HERE.

31:41.750 --> 31:43.500

31:43.542 --> 31:45.083
I HOPED SHE WOULD.

31:45.125 --> 31:48.041
(organ music playing)

31:48.083 --> 31:49.875
OKAY.

31:49.917 --> 31:51.917

31:51.959 --> 31:54.291

32:22.125 --> 32:25.083

THAT I MARRIED YOUR DAD.

32:25.125 --> 32:27.041

YOUR SOMETHING NEW...

32:44.166 --> 32:46.792

HAS STAYED WITH ME AS WELL.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.458
I CAME HOME ONE EVENING

38:36.500 --> 38:39.542
AFTER A-A MARATHON
OF KIDS' PARTIES AND WHATNOT,

38:39.583 --> 38:42.083
AND LITTLE MISS MAYA
WAS NOT QUITE READY

38:42.125 --> 38:45.083
TO TAKE HER LITTLE DRESS OFF
AND GET IN THE BATH.

38:45.125 --> 38:48.125
SO WE WENT TO HER ROOM
AND HUNG OUT ON HER FLOOR,

38:48.166 --> 38:49.750
STARTED TALKING.

38:49.792 --> 38:53.041
AND OUT OF NOWHERE, SHE TOLD ME
THAT WHEN SHE GREW UP,

38:53.083 --> 38:55.041
SHE WANTED TO MARRY ME.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.208
SO, UH, I SAID, "WHY?"

38:57.250 --> 38:59.208
I ASKED HER, I SAID, "WHY ME?"

38:59.250 --> 39:01.875
AND SHE LOOKED UP AT ME,

39:01.917 --> 39:03.750
AND SHE SAID, "BECAUSE, DADDY,

39:03.792 --> 39:07.041
YOU ARE MY ANYWAY FRIEND."

39:09.792 --> 39:12.750
NOW AT THE TIME,
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT.

39:12.792 --> 39:15.083
SO MAYA HAD TO EXPLAIN TO ME

39:15.125 --> 39:17.709
THAT AN ANYWAY FRIEND

39:17.750 --> 39:19.709
IS THE ONE PERSON IN YOUR LIFE

39:19.750 --> 39:22.750
WHO, NO MATTER WHAT
THEY SAY OR DO,

39:22.792 --> 39:25.583
NO MATTER WHAT THEY'VE
BEEN THROUGH WITH YOU,

39:25.625 --> 39:28.667
THEY LOVE YOU ANYWAY.

39:28.709 --> 39:33.750
SO MY SINCEREST HOPE
IS THAT FOR MAYA, DINK,

39:33.792 --> 39:38.041
AND FOR DINK, MAYA,
IS THAT ANYWAY FRIEND.

39:38.083 --> 39:40.041
