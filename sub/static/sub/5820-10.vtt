Do you have
any toothpaste left?

00:49.520 --> 00:51.841
No, 'cause someone's
been borrowing it

00:52.000 --> 00:54.241
every day for two weeks.

00:56.080 --> 00:59.880
- Carl.
- What? Denise says it's PT.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.611
- You heard me.
- Yeah.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.450
It's time to change
your bandage.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.090
And I need to borrow
some toothpaste.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.288
Okay, but I'm out of toothpaste.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.250
- Bye, Dad.
- I'll see you later.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.522
Come on, sweetheart.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.120
- You be good out there.
- Rick: Yeah, we'll see.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.970
And thank you.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.406
Oh.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.291
Spearmint and baking soda.
That's my favorite.

Rick:
Soon as I get it, you will.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.487
- Daryl;
_ Yes?

01:56.640 --> 01:57.721
This thing at the bottom
right here.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.450
You're talking
about the drink, right?

01:59.600 --> 02:01.523
I am, but...

02:03.320 --> 02:05.084
It's not medical.

02:05.240 --> 02:09.848
No, I drew a line between
the important stuff and that.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.685
I just figured, if you saw it.

02:12.840 --> 02:13.887
All right.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.042
Anything remotely medical
is a priority.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.964
And food, maybe even food
before medicine,

02:18.120 --> 02:21.806
and gas or batteries or books
for the kids or clothes is just--

02:21.960 --> 02:25.203
if you see it,
if it just happens to...

02:25.360 --> 02:27.124
you know, be right there.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.169
You like it, right?

02:29.320 --> 02:31.891
- No, I don't drink pop.
- What the hell's "pop"?

02:32.040 --> 02:34.691
Oh, I'm originally from Ohio.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.208
Why you want it?

02:42.040 --> 02:45.567
Tara was talking about it
in her sleep, I think.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.724
Either she likes it
or she doesn't,

02:48.880 --> 02:53.727
but if she likes it,
it'd be a really nice surprise.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.962
I'm not good
with that kind of stuff,

02:56.120 --> 02:57.690
and she and Heath are going
on that two-week run.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.411
I just thought it'd be
a nice going-away present.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.325
Just, uh, don't go
out of your way.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.801
And if it gives you any trouble...

03:05.960 --> 03:08.486
- I won't.
- Okay, good, 'cause it's not important.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.802
I should've said so instead
of just drawing a line.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.681
Got it.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.287
(growling )

03:42.640 --> 03:46.042
I mapped out some of the agricultural
supply places in the area.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.605
Even if they've been cleaned out,

03:47.760 --> 03:49.888
my bet is that the sorghum
would be untouched.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.684
Now, that there is a criminally
underrated grain

03:51.840 --> 03:53.251
that could change the game
with our food situation

03:53.400 --> 03:55.528
from scary to hunky-dunky.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.283
I'm talking standability,
drought tolerance,

04:03.440 --> 04:06.762
grain-to-stover ratio
that is the envy of all corns.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.562
Think about it.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.088
- Thanks.
- All right.

find nobody.

I'm not risking it.

- About a half a mile back.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.331
They're headed this way.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.051
You probably have
about 11 minutes.

12:07.480 --> 12:11.087
Okay, thanks
for letting us know.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.446

But, still,
best not to try anything.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.762
Best not to make threats
you can't keep, either.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.287
Exactly.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.283
- How many walkers--
- No, not this guy.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.084

have you killed?

13:21.240 --> 13:23.891

about seven minutes.

- He was clean.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.327

13:34.480 --> 13:36.847
There's more going on there.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.451
He didn't have a gun, either.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.887
We could track him,
watch him for a while,

13:41.040 --> 13:42.724
get to know more.

13:42.920 --> 13:46.527
See if he's really alone.
Maybe bring him back.

What are you doing out here?

15:09.080 --> 15:12.368

I saw someone was in the woods.

out here?

15:14.680 --> 15:17.001

Why the shovel?

15:29.720 --> 15:31.961
I'm gonna keep walking now.

15:32.120 --> 15:35.363
- I'm gonna come with you.
- That's okay.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.885
Your mom told me
I had to figure out what I want...

15:42.080 --> 15:44.208
for my whole life.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.163
Have you?

15:51.320 --> 15:53.687
I'm working up to it.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.691

I just want to find out

It's all gone.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.323
Come on.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.130
It doesn't look that old.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.089
- Yeah?
- I mean, we can't read what they wrote,

17:05.240 --> 17:08.050
but just by doing this,
they're saying something.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.690
What?

17:09.880 --> 17:12.008
"We're not alone."
( chuckles )

17:12.160 --> 17:15.881

17:22.240 --> 17:24.402
Why are we coming out here?

17:26.240 --> 17:28.607
'Cause we're kids.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.922
It's what they do.

Hey, whatever she wants.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.560
She saved Carl's life.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.001
We didn't know her,
and she turned out to be all right.

18:43.520 --> 18:47.161
If there's still people out here,
and they're still people,

18:47.320 --> 18:49.846
we should bring 'em in.

Let's go.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.162
( Leaves rustling )

19:35.000 --> 19:36.331
Come on.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.565
( Rustling continues )

19:55.400 --> 19:57.448
It was just Michonne
and Spencer.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.210
What were they doing?

20:05.360 --> 20:07.681
Walking.
I don't know.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.171
I don't want to
come out here anymore.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.321
Okay.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.122
( Low snarling )

21:08.960 --> 21:10.166
Carl.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.800
Michonne's out here.
I'm not leaving it.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.365
(whistles )

21:17.520 --> 21:20.490
(growling )

21:29.160 --> 21:30.685
No.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.922
Hey, come on.

21:33.080 --> 21:36.084
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

21:36.240 --> 21:39.005
- What are you doing?
- Just go.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.367
(growling )

21:43.640 --> 21:45.051
We should kill it.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.480
- Go home.
- No.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.005
- Enid.
- This is bullshit.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.885
It should be dead.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.929
- Let go.
- Just leave.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.683
( Snarling )

21:57.840 --> 22:01.322
You're not killing it.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.881
What the hell
is wrong with you?

22:04.040 --> 22:06.441
You wouldn't understand.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.444
(walker growling )

22:11.520 --> 22:13.887
You don't want to be out here.
You said it.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.202
So go home.

22:36.560 --> 22:39.245
( Panting )

23:18.400 --> 23:20.971
Hold still and maybe
we won't hurt you.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.326
Sure thing.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.323
. ( Grunting )
- Ah!

23:34.280 --> 23:35.441
This is done.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.530
(growling )

23:41.440 --> 23:43.204
Do you even have any ammo?

23:48.960 --> 23:51.566
Okay.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.210
You gonna shoot me
over a truck?

23:53.360 --> 23:55.647
There's a lot of food
on that truck.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.609
The keys, now.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.410
I think you know
I'm not a bad guy.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.369
Yeah?

24:01.520 --> 24:03.841
What do you know about us?

24:04.040 --> 24:05.929
Give me the keys.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.246
This is the last time I'm asking.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.849
Damn it.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.723
You're gonna leave me here like this?
You're really gonna do that?

24:24.880 --> 24:28.009
Eh, the knots aren't that tight.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.640
You should be able to get free...

24:30.800 --> 24:32.564
after we're long gone.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.530
- Maybe we should talk now.
- Nah.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.091
Here.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.408
In case you get thirsty.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.929
What about the guy?

28:36.080 --> 28:39.163
- What about him?
- Well, he helped you.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.843
Maybe.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.802
He ever pull a weapon on you?

28:51.440 --> 28:55.411
Fine.
Let's put him up a tree.

Why are you still here?

29:07.120 --> 29:10.169
I liked your mom a lot.

I really don't want you to die.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.970
So, come on.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.770
- Let's go home.
- My family's dead. That's not home.

29:17.920 --> 29:21.129
- It's just where I live.
- It's more than that.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.209
Hey, enough.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.323
I'm fine.

You've got a life back there,
and maybe I will, too,

29:30.360 --> 29:35.207
but before I can even think about that,
I need to take care of something.

29:42.040 --> 29:45.283
- I have to try.
- So let me help you.

that night.

I did.

31:35.960 --> 31:39.601
So that's why I was out here.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.723
She left me a note.

32:12.880 --> 32:16.441
She said
I still knew my way.

32:18.240 --> 32:22.165
( Chuckles )
I never knew my way.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.800
You loved your family?

32:25.000 --> 32:27.082
Yeah.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.004
Then you know your way.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.242
It's home.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.003
They're gone.

32:37.320 --> 32:40.324
I've been out here chasing you
all over the woods.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.804
You've still got family,

32:45.960 --> 32:48.008
and you've still got a home.

32:56.840 --> 32:59.525
- ( Sighs )
- Let's go.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.566
He took a pretty hard hit.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.722
Denise needs to look him over.

33:31.880 --> 33:33.564
Yeah.

33:33.720 --> 33:34.881
You wouldn't have
gone through with it.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.601
- You wouldn't have left him.
- I would've, right up in a tree.

33:38.760 --> 33:42.401
- I would've.
- No. I know.

33:42.560 --> 33:45.006
Almost as soon as we got
to Alexandria, you got it.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.447
You saw-- you...

33:47.600 --> 33:51.571
and Michonne, Glenn,
you all tried to tell me.

33:51.720 --> 33:54.371
So shut up.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.761

34:09.159 --> 34:12.926
Yeah,
that's the North Star.

34:13.080 --> 34:16.641
It's at the end
of the Little Dipper.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.406
Yeah.

just find that star.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.885
Carl.

34:51.639 --> 34:54.643
I saw what you did...

34:54.800 --> 34:56.643
with Deanna.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.967
Yeah?

35:04.160 --> 35:07.767
You should've left her
or killed her.

35:12.480 --> 35:14.960
No, that's stupid.

35:15.120 --> 35:17.885
What's stupid is you being out there
when you don't have to.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.485
You did the same thing.
You didn't--

35:19.640 --> 35:21.483
you and Spencer didn't have to
go out there, but you did.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.001
- That's different.
- It's not.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.242
I wasn't gonna leave her
out there like that.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.731
You wouldn't.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.531
You wouldn't. I know it.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.170
I couldn't kill her.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.926
- Why not?
- Because-- be--

35:36.560 --> 35:37.607
You could've killed her.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.171
No, I couldn't. I wouldn't.

35:39.360 --> 35:40.361
Were you playing
some sort of game out there?

35:40.520 --> 35:41.885
- Did you think that--
- No!

35:42.040 --> 35:43.087
Then why?

35:43.280 --> 35:44.441
Because it should be
someone who loved her,

35:44.600 --> 35:47.126
someone who's family,
and I-- I'd do it for you.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.770
I would.

36:00.040 --> 36:02.884
Come here.

36:07.280 --> 36:09.965
Me, too.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.526
(growling )

36:40.760 --> 36:42.808
You know, I was thinking...

36:42.960 --> 36:44.803
back before we went
out to the quarry.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.765
The morning
after Reg and Pete.

36:48.920 --> 36:52.402
You said we shouldn't be looking
for people no more.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.285
You were right.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.528
No...

36:57.680 --> 37:00.809
I was wrong.
You were right.

- Who is this?

Come on, man,
he's heavy.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.122
Oh, that thing,
uh, didn't work out.

37:35.280 --> 37:38.090
- It's this asshole's fault. Sorry.
- Lay him on the bed.

37:38.240 --> 37:41.323
All right, take a look at him.
He ain't staying, though.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.088
We'll see.

38:07.080 --> 38:10.050
It is pretty stupid of us
to go out there, isn't it?

38:10.200 --> 38:11.884
Yep.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.247
- Do it again tomorrow?
- Yep.

No, not right now.

for a minute.

about your day?

No.

Same thing.

- Mm-hmm.

40:08.680 --> 40:11.843
Well, I do have a crate
of toothpaste for you.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.288
