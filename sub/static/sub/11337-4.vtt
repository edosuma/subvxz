00:02.036 --> 00:03.335
WINNIE (over radio):
Team 1, hot call

00:03.337 --> 00:05.571
at the Michelangelo Foods
at Brimley and Matheson.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.740
Armed robbery,
multiple hostages.

00:07.742 --> 00:10.676
There's some
misunderstanding.
He's only 17.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.277
<i> You have got to get him</i>
<i> out of there.</i>

00:12.279 --> 00:13.445
Wordy, how you doing?

00:13.447 --> 00:14.780
I'm heading to the drops.
Steer me in.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.049
With haste, gentlemen,

00:17.051 --> 00:18.217
with haste.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.752
Where do I start?

00:19.754 --> 00:21.453
He's had the year from hell.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.556
Get out of my face.
It's over.

00:24.558 --> 00:25.591
Sierra 1 in position.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.259
Hold fire till my command.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.128
I thought I could trust you.
Put the gun down.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.598
Standing by for explosive entry.
Copy that.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.566
Think I won't do it?
I know you won't do it.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.101
Sierra 1...
I've got the solution.

00:36.103 --> 00:38.604
Donnie, give it to me.
It's over!
No!

00:38.606 --> 00:39.772
Scorpio.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.577
WOMAN:
<i> So that's it?</i>
<i> That's the plan: Lethbridge?</i>

00:45.579 --> 00:48.414
MAN:
Jack said he can
get me a job.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.782
WOMAN:
What about the restaurant?

00:49.784 --> 00:51.750
Your dream, our dream.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.685
It'll pick up again, David.

00:53.687 --> 00:54.753
By $30,000?

00:54.755 --> 00:57.823
Just give it time.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.259
See this letter, Liz?

01:00.261 --> 01:03.662
Do you see where it says
"Notice of eviction"?

01:03.664 --> 01:05.464
LIZ:
Don't talk to me
like I'm a child.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.498
Well, stop
acting like one.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.499
Face facts!

01:07.501 --> 01:09.835
The restaurant's a failure.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.439
So... whose fault is that?

01:13.441 --> 01:15.207
Don't you dare
lay this at my feet.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.809
Well, I'm not the one
dragging our family

01:16.811 --> 01:18.077
halfway across the country.

01:22.616 --> 01:23.649
Hey, Jules.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.350
Hey.
What are you doing here?

01:25.352 --> 01:26.718
That's a nice way to say hi.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.787
I'm sorry. I didn't
expect to see you.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.756
Glad you came by.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.724
Actually, I came
to talk to the boss.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.827
Oh.
Which... I should go.

01:34.829 --> 01:36.762
Hey, Jules, what's wrong?

01:36.764 --> 01:38.263
Nothing's wrong.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.565
You've been avoiding
me all week.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.300
I have not been
avoiding you all week.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.434
Yeah, you have, Jules.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.536
Sam, okay, I'm not going
to do this here.

01:44.538 --> 01:45.704
Do what?

01:45.706 --> 01:47.739
Hey, do what?

01:47.741 --> 01:49.708
When I return to the SRU...

01:49.710 --> 01:51.560
Jules, we talked about this.

01:51.561 --> 01:53.411
We did? Me bringing it up
and you changing the subject.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.546
That's not talking
about it, Sam.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.632
Well, what's the point?

01:56.633 --> 01:58.717
The point is, when I return
to the SRU,

01:58.719 --> 02:01.487
we have to talk about
what happens then, okay?

02:01.489 --> 02:03.689
Now you're on shift,
so let's talk tonight.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.390
Okay, I'll meet you
at your place.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.559
Okay. We'll get a coffee
or something.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.428
Okay, coffee.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.364
MAN:
I can't stand being
in this house anymore, man.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.665
I got to get out.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.201
Want to catch a movie?
Nah, I'm not into it.

02:16.203 --> 02:17.436
Go to the mall.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.705
Sit outside Bikini Cabin.
Come on, Donnie.

02:19.707 --> 02:20.906
What are you, like 12?

02:20.908 --> 02:22.407
Man, like you weren't into it

02:22.409 --> 02:23.809
when Tessa Price was there

02:23.811 --> 02:25.177
with the new belly button
piercing?

02:25.179 --> 02:26.678
Oh, my God.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.180
(knocking)

02:28.182 --> 02:29.515
Meet me at the shop in ten.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.582
All right.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.618
Hey, bud, Mom is out,

02:32.620 --> 02:33.886
so I thought
that we'd have a talk.

02:33.888 --> 02:36.288
About moving 3,400 clicks away?

02:37.491 --> 02:38.757
I checked.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.627
I'm sorry you found out
the way that you did.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.661
Well, what about school?

02:42.663 --> 02:43.896
And my friends?

02:43.898 --> 02:45.664
Aren't we just talking
about Donnie?

02:45.666 --> 02:47.399
Why are you always
ragging on him?

02:47.401 --> 02:50.936
Because it seems like your whole
world revolves around this kid.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.906
I-I... I really don't think
it's healthy.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.407
How about you just try

02:55.409 --> 02:58.744
expanding your horizons
a little bit?

02:58.746 --> 03:01.880
Hey, where are
you going?

03:01.882 --> 03:05.317
My horizons need expanding.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.938
So had to think fast, right?

03:09.939 --> 03:12.423
Like one of those times
when you got to do what
you got to do, right?

03:12.426 --> 03:13.792
So the subject comes
running up screaming.

03:13.794 --> 03:14.927
I kick the door
down, right?

03:14.929 --> 03:16.895
Spike didn't kick
the door in.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.180
I did.

03:18.181 --> 03:19.464
And the subject
wasn't screaming.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.466
Guys, you mind? I'm telling
a story here, okay?

03:21.468 --> 03:23.335
So the subject comes out
with this blade, Donna.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.770
And it's like
this big.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.055
DONNA:
Wow, a sword.

03:26.056 --> 03:27.339
Okay, okay, maybe
more like that.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.407
A machete.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.475
Yeah, sure, it
was a machete.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.944
Donna... it was this big.

03:31.946 --> 03:33.345
What are you talking
about this big?

03:33.347 --> 03:34.446
I'm just saying it was...

03:34.448 --> 03:35.447
What is that
supposed to be?

03:35.449 --> 03:36.982
That's not even
a letter opener.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.850
DONNA:
It doesn't matter
about the size, Spike.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.453
What are you doing that?
You know you shouldn't
do that to a guy ever.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.222
Sam, you're late for workout.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.923
Sorry, sir.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.864
DONNIE:
No.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.433
What do you mean no?

03:54.435 --> 03:55.934
I mean, no,
you can't go.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.302
Like I have a choice?

03:57.304 --> 03:59.571
Look, my parents are
broke or something.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.939
They're behind on rent.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.374
They're kicking us out.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.976
Then all we've got to do
is find the money.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.410
Yeah, and how are
we going to do that?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.914
I don't know.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.582
My dad's got some old vinyl.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.284
Maybe we could sell it
online or something.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.685
Donnie, it's like 30 grand.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.953
There's no way.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.421
Dude, you can't go.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.257
You're the only
non-jerk I know.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.925
Please, I'm already
pissed off.

04:19.927 --> 04:20.859
Don't make it worse.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.394
You should be.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.329
We grew up here.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.365
This is our store.
That's our mall.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.033
This is our life.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.869
They're going to
throw it all away?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.004
Let's go.

04:32.006 --> 04:33.939
I need to chill.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.334
How you doing?

04:45.335 --> 04:47.619
I asked you a question, Sam.
How you doing?

04:47.621 --> 04:48.820
Fine. I'm fine.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.821
You look like crap.

04:49.823 --> 04:50.922
Thanks.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.924
But you're fine?

04:52.926 --> 04:55.294
That's what I said.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.929
That's what you said.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.931
Oh, you're mirroring me, Ed?

04:59.933 --> 05:01.500
'Cause I'm your teammate,
not your subject.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.035
I know that,
but if something's wrong,

05:03.037 --> 05:05.570
it's going to affect your
performance; I need to know.

05:05.572 --> 05:09.341
I'm fine. Really.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.927
Hold up.

05:32.433 --> 05:35.367
Bro, what are you doing?

05:37.938 --> 05:40.639
Why are we stopping here?
I want some cookies.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.941
You serious? They have them
at the convenience store.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.009
Yeah, well, I like
the ones they have here.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.410
Do you know how much
they charge?

05:45.412 --> 05:47.045
They're like ten bucks.
Yeah, dude, I know.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.113
I used to work here.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.048
That's how I got hooked on 'em.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.683
Why'd they fire you anyway?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.485
'Cause they're jerks.
I was totally awesome

05:53.487 --> 05:55.053
at that job, man,
totally dedicated.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.523
The cookies are that way.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.925
No, no, they're
up there now.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.093
What?

06:02.830 --> 06:04.830
I got so much work
in the office.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.631
I'm never going home.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.033
That the guy
that fired you?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.402
No. He's Ashton,
the night manager.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.571
You know, after my dedicated
service to this establishment,

06:12.573 --> 06:14.039
I think I deserve
a parting gift.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.674
Can you not do this
right now?

06:15.676 --> 06:16.775
Nylons?

06:16.777 --> 06:18.143
For my mom.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.948
Donnie...

06:22.950 --> 06:24.082
Let's hit the head.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.851
There's one in the back--
employees only.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.086
Just drop the stuff
so we can go.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.454
Bathroom first.

06:29.456 --> 06:30.622
Come on.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.890
What?!

06:37.631 --> 06:39.598
We're not supposed
to be here.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.665
Oh, easy, Grandma.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.900
It's almost closing time.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.402
No one's gonna
be back here.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.509
In five minutes,
the head teller's gonna give

06:50.511 --> 06:52.043
the deposit bags
to Ashton.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.146
No. No, I do not want
to hear this.

06:54.148 --> 06:55.447
Just listen.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.915
Ashton's going to bring
the deposit bags

06:56.917 --> 06:59.050
down to the safe to be picked up
later tonight by security.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.920
What are you saying?
I'm saying we stop him.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.189
Jump out, grab the money.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.924
We run out that service door.
It's easy.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.058
No, it's not. It's stupid!

07:07.060 --> 07:10.629
Your dad needs money,
right? For rent?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.765
Dude, come on!
Look, man.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.034
We're brothers, okay?

07:16.036 --> 07:17.869
And brothers are always
there for each other.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.942
Five minutes and everything
gets taken care of.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.011
Five minutes and you get
everything you need.

07:27.448 --> 07:30.715
Some dude did the exact
same thing a year ago.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.184
He made off
with like 70K.

07:32.186 --> 07:33.718
Okay, whatever.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.953
It's still wrong.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.488
The store's insured.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.123
They don't care.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.999
D, stop.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.535
Stop and think a second.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.637
I have. And you can
either step up and help,

07:52.639 --> 07:55.140
or you can turn your back
and let me go out there alone.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.509
Dude, you know I'm not going
to let you do that by yourself.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.577
So you're with me?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.614
Yeah.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.484
Yeah.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.920
You're with me.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.163
Give me the money!

08:23.136 --> 08:25.537
Come on! Come on!

08:34.214 --> 08:36.982
Lose the stocking.
Lose the stocking!

08:39.186 --> 08:41.052
(laughing)

08:45.158 --> 08:46.758
Drop the bag.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.993
Drop it.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.694
Drop it!

08:50.531 --> 08:51.963
Come on! Come on!

09:01.208 --> 09:02.307
(grunting)

09:02.309 --> 09:04.009
Help me!

09:04.011 --> 09:06.111
Donnie!

09:06.113 --> 09:07.546
Get him off!

09:10.083 --> 09:12.217
What the... what the hell?!

09:12.219 --> 09:14.085
What the hell did you do?!

09:14.087 --> 09:15.320
DONNIE:
You wanted me
to help you.

09:15.322 --> 09:18.957
Go. We're headed out
the front door.

09:25.299 --> 09:28.700
We're just two customers
walking out the front door.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.769
Nearly there.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.106
ASHTON:
Like I said, there
was two of them.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.741
A big guy in
a black jacket.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.643
The other guy
had a red coat.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.879
(sirens blaring)
They were armed...

09:40.881 --> 09:42.213
That's them.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.181
We're done, man.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.716
It's over.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.185
It ain't over, bro.

09:47.187 --> 09:50.755
Not even close.

09:50.757 --> 09:54.793
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

10:26.360 --> 10:28.693
WINNIE (over radio):
Team 1, hot call

10:28.695 --> 10:31.196
at the Michelangelo Foods
at Brimley and Matheson.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.698
Armed robbery,
multiple hostages.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.900
(sirens blaring)

10:39.206 --> 10:41.106
(tires screech)

10:44.711 --> 10:46.978
Sam and Donna,
recon the building,

10:46.980 --> 10:48.113
all ways in and out.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.648
Copy that.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.083
Okay, here's
what we know.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.654
Old-school stickup, two masked
guys come in before closing,

10:55.656 --> 10:57.288
hold up the manager
with a knife.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.057
And moved away from the window.
No shot.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.259
Spike, let's make sure
everyone's healthy in there.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.894
I can get into the security
system, patch it into the truck.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.162
Eyes in ten minutes.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.764
You got five.
Lew, you're my second.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.933
Copy that.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.101
Sarge, subjects bumped into
armed security as they fled.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.303
One of the guards chased 'em
back inside.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.439
After that, we don't know
what happened to them.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.241
Okay, well, let's hope

11:16.242 --> 11:18.042
they didn't get their hands
on his gun.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.844
See if we can ID him, Wordy.

11:19.846 --> 11:20.845
Copy.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.814
Eddy, tac options?

11:22.815 --> 11:24.782
We got high exposed ceilings,
lots of vantage.

11:24.785 --> 11:28.787
I say we stealth in, set up
a sniper perch, watch and wait.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.389
All right, well, you know
what you need to do.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.724
Copy that.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.297
ADAM:
Hey...

11:39.299 --> 11:41.199
Look...

11:41.201 --> 11:43.234
this is really making me
nervous.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.869
Will you put it away?

11:44.871 --> 11:47.739
Kinda using it right now.

11:47.741 --> 11:48.740
Dude, robbery is one thing,

11:48.742 --> 11:50.075
but now there's a gun, okay?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.810
There are hostages.
I know.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.144
It's cool, huh?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.045
Cool?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.081
He used to work here.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.082
No, I didn't.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.717
Yeah, you did.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.351
You're the guy they caught
napping in the storeroom.
What's your name again?

12:00.353 --> 12:01.820
Richie?

12:01.822 --> 12:02.854
No, it wasn't me.

12:02.856 --> 12:03.922
Yeah, whatever.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.023
Don't "whatever" me.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.057
Yeah, man, whatever.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.826
I'm not scared of you.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.394
You're not gonna use that gun.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.162
He's not gonna use the gun.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.398
I'd prefer to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.899
(clanking)

12:14.901 --> 12:16.768
This is Sergeant Gregory Parker

12:16.770 --> 12:18.837
with the Police Strategic
Response Unit.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.772
I will be calling
the store phone,

12:20.774 --> 12:23.508
so please pick it up
so we can talk this over.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.845
Okay, dude, when he calls,
we'll say we're sorry.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.279
Let's forget about it
and go home.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.983
He sounded nice.
Maybe, maybe he could help.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.952
Maybe, maybe he'll lessen
the charges.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.887
It's not like we did
anything that bad.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.122
'Cept for armed robbery.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.523
Not like that's a felony.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.724
Is this what

12:39.725 --> 12:40.924
it's gonna take
for you to shut up?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.894
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.329
What happened there, tough guy?
What happened?

12:44.331 --> 12:45.463
Something scare you?

12:45.465 --> 12:47.532
Not so chatty
now, are you?
D, stop!

12:48.435 --> 12:52.904
Dude, this is
messed up.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.773
Let's just walk away.

12:54.775 --> 12:58.076
Oh, yeah, yeah, walk
right into jail.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.812
And you know what happens
in jail, don't you?

13:00.814 --> 13:03.014
To guys like you and me, hmm?

13:03.016 --> 13:04.516
Think about it.

13:04.518 --> 13:05.884
Tape their wrists.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.496
Is there anything you can give
that'll help ID these guys?

13:18.498 --> 13:20.365
Height, weight, tattoos,
scars, anything?

13:20.367 --> 13:22.033
Oh, man, it was all
a big blur.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.002
One was black;
one was white.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.070
One of 'em was wearing
one of those

13:26.072 --> 13:27.272
glow-in-the-dark ankle bands.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.473
Like cyclists wear?

13:28.475 --> 13:31.042
Yeah.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.812
9:48 p.m.: SRU on scene.

13:33.814 --> 13:36.114
Armed robbery, Michelangelo's.
Establishing command post.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.917
Spike, eyes.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.286
Moments away, boss.
Moments away.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.962
(phone rings)

13:50.964 --> 13:52.530
That's the cops.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.000
Take over.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.906
Hey, this is
Sergeant Greg Parker.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.441
Who am I speaking to?

14:03.443 --> 14:05.476
This is...

14:05.478 --> 14:07.946
this is D-Roc.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.415
D-Roc, is that
a nickname, last name?

14:10.417 --> 14:12.217
I had a buddy back home.
We used

14:12.219 --> 14:13.618
to call him "D."
His name was Daryl.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.253
Your name Daryl?

14:15.254 --> 14:16.887
Look, I know how you guys
operate, okay?

14:16.890 --> 14:19.290
Don't try to be my buddy.
Don't play me.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.959
I'm not here to play games,
D-Roc.

14:20.961 --> 14:21.993
I'm here to help you.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.128
(scoffs)

14:25.065 --> 14:26.064
That went well.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.933
Spike, eyes?

14:28.935 --> 14:31.069
Let there be light.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.041
Got a customer in scrubs.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.910
Maybe a nurse?

14:38.912 --> 14:40.078
Those two look
like employees.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.145
Possibly a manager.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.648
PARKER:
That's D-Roc. Subject one.

14:43.650 --> 14:44.866
Yeah?

14:44.867 --> 14:46.083
Hey, D-Roc, I need
to know who else

14:46.086 --> 14:47.952
is in there with you.
Can you tell me?

14:47.954 --> 14:49.087
We got three hostages.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.421
Not including
the security guard?

14:50.423 --> 14:52.423
Yeah. Not including him.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.058
And he's unharmed?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.059
He's fine.

14:55.061 --> 14:55.927
He's not hurt?

14:55.929 --> 14:57.195
I told you he's fine.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.429
He's in the back.
Don't worry about him.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.498
Okay, D-Roc, your partner.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.966
Mind if I ask what his name is?

15:01.968 --> 15:04.135
Backslash.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.004
"Backslash."

15:06.006 --> 15:08.072
All right, I told you
what you wanted to know.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.073
Now it's my turn.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.074
Let's talk demands.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.042
All right.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.143
We need to get out of here.

15:12.145 --> 15:12.977
Okay. Where?

15:12.979 --> 15:15.046
Where we wanna go?

15:15.048 --> 15:16.514
Home.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.916
Come on. Gimme something!

15:19.052 --> 15:20.869
Tell you where
we're going later.

15:20.870 --> 15:22.687
Right now, you just get us
something to take us there.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.122
Okay, where?

15:24.124 --> 15:25.657
He doesn't know
what he wants.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.692
He's covering insecurity
with arrogance right now.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.327
He's scared.
But determined.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.462
Not a happy combo.

15:31.464 --> 15:34.232
Those aliases come up
in the database?

15:34.234 --> 15:35.500
D-Roc and Backslash
come back clean.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.001
Maybe it's
a gang initiation.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.336
Nah, Backslash,
that's not street.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.337
That's a computer thing.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.039
Okay, could be a handle.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.007
Guys, Facebook, MySpace,
online forums.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.008
Copy.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.010
I got a couple of bikes here.

15:46.012 --> 15:48.179
Wordy, check the undersides
for serial numbers.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.284
Uh, there's nothing
on the first one.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.556
Wait, I got one.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.024
487

16:00.026 --> 16:01.459
623.

16:01.461 --> 16:05.129
Okay, Winnie, subject's bike
has a serial number: 487623.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.365
Accessing Metro Police database.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.600
(typing)
Got it.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.170
"Adam Jackson.
32 Fern Crescent, Markham."

16:12.172 --> 16:14.072
Age?

16:14.074 --> 16:15.106
He's 17.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.441
Wonderful Winnie.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.310
Have uniforms dispatch
to that address immediately.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.445
You got it. (typing)

16:20.447 --> 16:22.380
This is Winnie Camden
with the SRU.

16:22.382 --> 16:26.017
I need uniforms
at 3230 Fern Crescent ASAP.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.619
Kids.
Perfect.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.122
Guys, no one wants a kid
in their crosshairs.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.423
Copy that.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.293
Guys, I got a way in.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.995
The subjects are barricaded
in here

16:36.997 --> 16:39.564
which gives them good sightlines
on the front and side entrances.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.299
So we come in
from the rear?

16:41.301 --> 16:43.634
Yeah. We check out
the loading dock.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.370
If we can't go through,
there's a trapdoor

16:45.371 --> 16:47.105
in the storage room that will
get us to the machine room.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.474
So we shimmy up,
pry open the trapdoor
to the machine room.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.309
Then we're on the roof. Nice.
Exactly.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.411
There's a skylight right here,
which give us good vantage.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.080
Cut a hole, set up a perch.
I line up the Sierra shot.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.649
No, I got it.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.217
Is there any reason why you
don't want me to take it?

16:59.219 --> 17:01.686
Do I need one?
It's my team, my call.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.155
Donna, contain the front.
Let's go.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.761
Okay, guys, it looks
like the hostages

17:09.763 --> 17:13.131
are in the back right corner of
the store in the deli section.

17:13.133 --> 17:16.601
We're gonna need options if
we're gonna avoid a Sierra shot.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.170
Boss, Adam's mom's here.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.145
Mrs. Jackson,
I'm Sergeant Parker.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.114
How's Adam?
Is he all right?

17:29.115 --> 17:31.082
He's unharmed, ma'am,
but he's in a lot of trouble.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.251
He's in there
with the other kid.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.286
They robbed the store.
It went south.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.621
And they took hostages.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.056
No, no, no, that's crazy.

17:38.058 --> 17:41.459
There is some misunderstanding.
He is only 17.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.494
You have got to get
him out of there.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.263
Can I ask you something?

17:45.265 --> 17:46.998
Yes.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.732
Does the name D-Roc
mean anything to you?

17:48.735 --> 17:51.135
Donnie, Donnie Lakeman.
That's his best friend.

17:51.137 --> 17:52.670
Do you have an address?

17:52.672 --> 17:54.138
Somewhere on, on,
Kuniff Crescent.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.206
Thank you. Lewis, you copy?

17:55.208 --> 17:56.474
Got it.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.309
Okay. Do you know
if Donnie's been diagnosed

17:58.311 --> 18:00.545
with any disorders
or conditions?

18:00.547 --> 18:03.347
I don't know.
It wouldn't surprise me.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.716
That's one good thing
about us moving:

18:05.718 --> 18:08.386
getting Adam
away from Donnie.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.787
I have to call my husband.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.189
You're moving?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.623
Yes.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.858
Thank you.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.495
Please don't do this.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.764
Just be quiet.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.800
You should...
you should get the phone.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.669
Don't tell me. I know.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.270
I'm trying to figure this out.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.309
Look down.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.311
Please?

18:37.283 --> 18:38.850
You're pregnant?

18:38.852 --> 18:40.251
20 weeks.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.653
It's a boy.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.289
I didn't know.
I didn't know.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.259
It's okay, but...
but now you do, right?

18:48.261 --> 18:50.628
So you can let me go.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.464
Look, you didn't sign up
for this.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.855
Please help me.

18:54.856 --> 18:56.245
DONNIE:
Bro, I've been thinking.

18:56.246 --> 18:57.635
Me, too.
All right, you see
that lady over there?

18:57.637 --> 18:59.303
We need to get
a chopper.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.438
We get a chopper,
we can get out of here.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.706
Donnie...
Think it through!

19:01.708 --> 19:03.875
If we get a chopper,
they can't chase us!

19:03.877 --> 19:04.876
You're not thinking
straight.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.277
I'm the one who's trying

19:06.278 --> 19:07.677
to get us out of here.
You're not thinking straight.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.846
The last thing we need is...

19:08.848 --> 19:10.648
Look out behind you!
He's got a knife!

19:13.686 --> 19:15.686
(screaming)

19:15.688 --> 19:17.788
Subject has shot the guard.
The guard is down!

19:17.790 --> 19:18.923
Shot fired!
Shot fired!

19:18.925 --> 19:20.291
What did you do?!

19:20.293 --> 19:22.293
What did you do?!

19:22.295 --> 19:24.295
(panting)

19:32.438 --> 19:33.504
LEWIS:
10:05 p.m.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.805
Shot fired. Guard hit.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.708
Why did you shoot him?

19:37.710 --> 19:39.210
He was going to kill you.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.845
You saw the way he came at you.

19:40.847 --> 19:41.879
It was him or you.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.314
I just wanted to help my dad.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.650
This is bad, Donnie.
This is bad!

19:45.652 --> 19:46.851
D-Roc. D-Roc!

19:46.853 --> 19:48.286
Use the aliases.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.955
There's a man bleeding here
that you shot!

19:50.957 --> 19:53.224
We're going to jail!

19:56.663 --> 19:57.795
We've got a man down.

19:57.797 --> 19:58.963
Medics stand by.

19:58.965 --> 19:59.931
Gunshot wound.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.866
Eddie, we got to step this up.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.467
EDDIE:
Copy. Entering loading dock.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.236
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.637
D, stop.

20:06.639 --> 20:07.805
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!

20:07.807 --> 20:09.974
Stop. Chill, man. Come on.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.376
All right. Chill?
How about this?

20:12.378 --> 20:14.812
(shouting)

20:14.814 --> 20:16.214
Huh?

20:16.216 --> 20:17.848
Or how about this?

20:21.421 --> 20:23.254
Pick up the phone. Pick up
the phone. Pick up the phone.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.890
(phone rings)

20:28.261 --> 20:29.827
I'm so sorry.
He didn't mean...

20:29.829 --> 20:30.962
He didn't mean to shoot.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.430
He didn't mean to shoot...

20:32.432 --> 20:33.531
He didn't mean to shoot!

20:33.533 --> 20:34.865
Give me the phone!

20:34.867 --> 20:36.867
They'll hear us
if we blast that.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.636
All right, Wordy, there it is.
Right there.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.840
All right, you stay
here and contain.
All right.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.408
Give it to me!

20:44.410 --> 20:46.811
(panting)

20:46.813 --> 20:49.447
Okay, okay.
Listen to me.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.781
I'm listening.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.016
You can see in here, right?

20:52.018 --> 20:54.418
I know you can see.
You saw what happened.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.853
He came at my friend
with a knife.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.955
What would you do, huh?

20:57.957 --> 20:59.924
Someone came at your best friend
with a knife?

20:59.926 --> 21:02.660
No, you were trying to protect
your friend. I hear you, D-Roc.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.028
That's right.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.329
You got that right.

21:05.331 --> 21:06.430
That's what you do.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.798
And that's why I'm here,

21:07.800 --> 21:09.300
trying to talk to you.

21:09.302 --> 21:10.768
Trying to keep
you and Adam safe.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.902
Okay?

21:11.904 --> 21:13.537
Now, how's that guard doing?

21:27.487 --> 21:29.987
I need you to
help the guard.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.422
What? No.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.623
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.059
Please. Because
we can't go in for murder.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.061
All right?
Robbery is one thing,

21:37.063 --> 21:38.896
but if the guy dies...
What am I supposed to do?

21:38.898 --> 21:40.965
You're a nurse.
I'm a dental hygienist.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.900
Just do what you can, okay?

21:42.902 --> 21:44.435
Just do what you can, please.

21:49.075 --> 21:49.991
He really needs your help.

21:49.992 --> 21:50.908
DONNIE:
I don't care if it's
complicated, smart guy...

21:50.910 --> 21:51.976
Give me some washcloths.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.945
Plastic wrap, whatever.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.348
Okay.

21:59.585 --> 22:00.951
Hey, where are you going?

22:00.953 --> 22:02.586
I don't have time
to explain, okay?

22:02.588 --> 22:04.388
She's helping the guard
and we need stuff.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.990
He knows your name.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.892
He knows your name, dude.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.594
That's okay.
It's okay.

22:10.596 --> 22:11.996
Just be ready to leave, okay?

22:11.998 --> 22:13.431
I told him we wanted a chopper.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.032
What is wrong with you?

22:15.034 --> 22:17.335
The only way
we're getting out of here

22:17.336 --> 22:19.637
is with our hands in the air or
with our backs on a stretcher.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.022
You don't know that.

22:21.023 --> 22:22.406
Yes, I do.
We're not getting out.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.342
Well, we have to.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.010
It's over.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.412
It's not. It's not over.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.815
Look, I'm helping those people.

22:31.784 --> 22:32.950
What about the plan?

22:32.952 --> 22:34.985
There's no plan, Donnie!

22:34.987 --> 22:36.854
We're finished.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.759
Wait!

22:41.761 --> 22:43.627
Come on.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.696
Let go of me.

22:48.935 --> 22:49.967
Adam?

22:49.969 --> 22:52.136
Hey, boss?

22:52.138 --> 22:53.637
Donnie's mom
just got here.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.706
Okay.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.979
Hi.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.848
I'm Sergeant Greg Parker.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.416
I'm in charge
of the negotiation.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.017
Christine Lakeman.

23:07.019 --> 23:09.720
On the way over here,
an officer was telling me

23:09.722 --> 23:12.790
what's going on inside
with Donnie.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.526
That Donnie shot someone.
Is that true?

23:15.528 --> 23:17.762
I'm afraid so, Christine.

23:17.764 --> 23:20.097
The man's alive, but needs
immediate medical attention.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.532
I know this is hard for you,

23:21.534 --> 23:23.167
but can you tell me
about your son?

23:23.169 --> 23:25.002
Where do I start?

23:25.004 --> 23:27.071
It's just... he's had
the year from hell.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.408
Yeah.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.742
Go on, please.

23:31.744 --> 23:35.479
Well, he's never been
the same kid since...

23:35.481 --> 23:38.983
since Travis passed away.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.485
I'm sorry to hear that.
Now, Travis...?

23:41.487 --> 23:43.754
His brother.
His big brother.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.157
Donnie worshipped him.

23:46.159 --> 23:48.726
Yeah. Could see that
must be tough on him.

23:52.899 --> 23:57.635
Donnie's father-- my ex--
he-he left sometime after

23:57.637 --> 23:59.670
and then Donnie just

23:59.672 --> 24:02.706
slid from As to Cs to Ds
and then...

24:02.708 --> 24:05.576
He just got into all sorts
of trouble at school and...

24:05.578 --> 24:08.546
All sorts of trouble.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.147
Sergeant, please.

24:10.149 --> 24:16.020
I have already lost one son,
and Donnie is all I have left,

24:16.022 --> 24:20.591
and I can't... I can't
lose my boy, please.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.660
Christine, that's the
last thing I want to do.

24:24.197 --> 24:25.896
I want to do
everything I can

24:25.898 --> 24:28.165
to get Donnie out of
there safely, okay?

24:28.167 --> 24:30.234
All right?

24:30.236 --> 24:31.469
Thank you.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.051
Here.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.008
(phone rings)

25:12.211 --> 25:14.111
Where's my chopper?

25:14.113 --> 25:15.813
We're still working on that,
Donnie.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.048
How do you know my name?

25:18.050 --> 25:19.149
I spoke to your mom.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.718
I spoke to both your moms.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.186
and they're-they're worried
about you guys.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.989
I know you're worried
about Adam, too.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.690
I hear he's moving away, huh?

25:26.692 --> 25:28.726
Oh, he's not moving away.
He's not going anywhere.

25:28.728 --> 25:29.860
Where's the chopper?

25:29.862 --> 25:31.829
Is that what Adam wants, too?

25:31.831 --> 25:33.797
I want the chopper!

25:33.799 --> 25:37.234
Maybe I'm not making
myself very clear.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.235
So I'll make it very clear.

25:38.237 --> 25:41.071
I want a chopper now!

25:47.079 --> 25:48.712
Let's get Adam's
cell phone number.

25:48.714 --> 25:49.880
Let's try to go
through him.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.181
Copy that.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.986
Freeze it.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.863
Got it.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.231
Text him,
"This is Sergeant Parker.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.666
I want to help."

26:12.171 --> 26:14.238
(cell phone beeping)

26:16.208 --> 26:17.641
Who's that?

26:20.313 --> 26:23.647
My mom. Wants to know
if I'm all right.

26:23.649 --> 26:24.882
I'll get rid of her.

26:30.690 --> 26:33.757
Okay. "I understand, but we need
your help talking him down."

26:42.134 --> 26:43.867
"Don't be. I'll be with you."

26:50.242 --> 26:51.675
What are you doing?

27:03.189 --> 27:04.688
What were you doing
with the phone?

27:04.690 --> 27:07.224
What I said.
Texting my mom.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.629
What, you don't believe me?

27:11.631 --> 27:12.930
Come on, Donnie.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.231
We got to get out of here.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.033
What do you think
I've been trying to do?

27:16.035 --> 27:18.902
I mean, we got to walk out,
hands in the air.

27:18.904 --> 27:20.104
No!

27:20.106 --> 27:21.405
It will just be me and you.

27:21.407 --> 27:22.873
Like it's always been.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.174
"Like it's always been."

27:24.176 --> 27:26.310
Yeah. You and me.

27:32.118 --> 27:35.119
Go. Your girlfriend needs you.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.998
Okay, guys,
we got Adam cooperating here.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.299
We're on a three-point plan.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.368
Wordy's on a covert
earbud delivery.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.737
Ed and Sam, secure positions
on the roof.

27:53.739 --> 27:55.906
Spike and Donna,
explosive entries

27:55.908 --> 27:57.207
through the front
on my command.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.742
I'll get a window charge ready.

28:01.747 --> 28:02.846
Wordy, you locate the entry
to the vent yet?

28:02.848 --> 28:05.316
WORDY:
Affirmative.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.785
You sure you want to let
a 17-year-old kid
talk down an EUP?

28:07.787 --> 28:09.219
We got a man down
losing a lot of blood.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.738
We got to move fast,

28:10.739 --> 28:12.256
and Adam's our best option
to end this right now.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.858
That kid says
the wrong thing,

28:14.860 --> 28:16.226
it's going to get
way out of hand.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.761
Things always get
way out of hand.

28:17.763 --> 28:19.196
Hey, I'm in no hurry
to pull the trigger

28:19.198 --> 28:21.198
on someone barely old enough
to drive, all right?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.866
Okay. This is good to go.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.201
Ed, Sam, update!

28:24.203 --> 28:25.335
We're on the move.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.304
With haste, gentlemen.
With haste!

28:27.306 --> 28:29.373
Got to get these folks
out of there.

28:30.342 --> 28:33.243
I'm heading to the drop.
Steer me in.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.212
Yep, I got you
on my screen, Wordy.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.380
Taking the heating duct highway.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.148
LEWIS:
Cozy, huh?

28:38.150 --> 28:40.317
(chuckles)
Yeah, real cozy.

28:43.289 --> 28:44.488
Is he okay?

28:44.490 --> 28:47.057
He's shot.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.460
Are you okay?

28:49.462 --> 28:50.928
How bad is he?
Can I...

28:50.930 --> 28:52.096
Don't-Don't touch it.
Don't move it.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.931
I just want to
see if you...

28:53.932 --> 28:55.765
There's clotting in the blood
at the site of the wound.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.234
If we move it now,

28:57.236 --> 28:59.303
we destroy all the healing
that's been happening.

28:59.305 --> 29:02.272
I knew you could help him.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.742
I help pull wisdom teeth.

29:04.744 --> 29:07.010
I'm not a doctor.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.247
Okay. That's it, Wordy.
Keep going.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.482
You're approaching
a drop right now.

29:11.484 --> 29:13.751
Okay, I see it coming.

29:16.355 --> 29:19.056
Hey, Lew,

29:19.058 --> 29:21.458
how much weight are these things
ready to hold up, anyway?

29:21.460 --> 29:23.527
I don't know, man.
I guess we're going to find out.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.863
Great.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.356
Thirsty.

29:52.358 --> 29:53.991
I'm sorry.
You can't have anything.

29:53.992 --> 29:55.625
But they're going
to have us out of here

29:55.626 --> 29:57.259
at any minute, and you'll be
in surgery before you know it.

29:57.263 --> 29:58.428
Are you a doctor?

29:58.430 --> 30:01.265
No. I'm...

30:01.267 --> 30:04.168
I'm a medical professional.

30:09.275 --> 30:12.342
Seconds away, boss.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.411
One, two, three.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.382
Wordy, how you doing?

30:18.384 --> 30:19.817
Dropped the earbud.

30:19.819 --> 30:20.984
(panting)

30:20.986 --> 30:22.586
Next time, remind me
to bring a towel.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.087
Copy.

30:24.089 --> 30:25.489
Lew, text Adam.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.958
Earpiece is waiting,
household cleaners aisle.

30:29.595 --> 30:30.894
Good.
Yep.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.434
(phones ringing)

30:39.405 --> 30:40.838
This is your last chance.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.472
Yeah, we're still
working on it, Donnie.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.474
DONNIE:
That's what you said
last time.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.243
PARKER:
I know, and you're
being really patient.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.478
I want to thank you for that.
You're a smart guy.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.380
What'd I tell you
about playing me?

30:50.382 --> 30:52.015
Paper towels.
I got to tell you,

30:52.017 --> 30:53.116
I'm running out of patience.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.023
Sierra 1 in position.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.302
PARKER (over earpiece):
Hey, Adam, look up.

31:16.942 --> 31:19.042
Sierra 1 standing by.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.347
Sierra 1, you have a solution?

31:23.349 --> 31:25.215
I've got the solution.

31:26.952 --> 31:28.485
Copy.

31:28.487 --> 31:29.519
Entry team.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.191
Standing by for explosive entry.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.993
Copy.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.262
Okay, Adam.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.264
Now, don't let Donnie
get too close to you.

31:40.266 --> 31:41.665
He'll see that earbud,
all right?

31:41.667 --> 31:42.666
Remember that.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.368
Now, just talk to Donnie

31:44.370 --> 31:46.103
about what he's been through
this year.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.238
Acknowledge how hard
it must have been.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.441
D... I know

31:51.443 --> 31:54.678
this year has been
the worst... ever.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.481
Travis died and your dad bailed.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.616
It's been brutal.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.084
That's great. That's great.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.387
You've always
been there for him.

32:03.389 --> 32:04.655
But you know
I've always been there

32:04.657 --> 32:06.156
for you, man.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.424
I know.

32:07.426 --> 32:11.128
And, Donnie, I-I'll always be,
no matter what.

32:11.130 --> 32:14.398
No, you won't.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.933
I shot a guy.

32:15.935 --> 32:18.101
I'm going to prison,
and you're going to jail, too.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.169
No, that's not true.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.304
It is!

32:20.306 --> 32:22.339
Now, Adam, it's gonna be okay.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.074
It's gonna be okay.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.276
Just... you're his friend.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.277
Remember that.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.278
Just be his friend.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.515
Okay, look...

32:31.517 --> 32:32.983
I'm not gonna lie to you.

32:32.985 --> 32:35.485
All right, this
situation sucks.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.390
But... thing is...

32:40.392 --> 32:42.192
You can get through it together.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.461
(static crackles over earbud)

32:44.463 --> 32:46.129
But what?

32:46.131 --> 32:47.664
Adam?

32:47.666 --> 32:49.499
What are you doing?

32:49.501 --> 32:51.535
Adam, don't touch your ear.

32:51.537 --> 32:53.470
Nothing.

32:53.472 --> 32:56.540
What's that?

33:00.446 --> 33:01.712
DONNIE:
What the hell is that?!

33:01.714 --> 33:03.080
ADAM:
Nothing!

33:03.082 --> 33:04.214
It's for my phone!

33:04.216 --> 33:05.615
No, it's not.
Who gave that to you?

33:05.617 --> 33:06.683
No one. It's mine.

33:06.685 --> 33:09.086
The cops?
(panting)

33:10.422 --> 33:13.757
How could you?

33:13.759 --> 33:15.726
Eddie, you got good eyes
on this kid?

33:15.728 --> 33:16.526
Yeah.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.261
And what do you see?

33:18.263 --> 33:19.696
ED:
He's scared.
And what else?

33:19.698 --> 33:22.032
Boss, barricaded subjects
usually stay elevated.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.567
This kid's ping-ponging.

33:23.569 --> 33:27.070
Okay, as long as he stays
deescalated, we stand down.

33:27.072 --> 33:28.505
Sierra 1 standing by.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.741
The cops?

33:30.743 --> 33:32.609
You've been talking to the cops?

33:32.611 --> 33:34.478
D, no. I...

33:34.480 --> 33:35.645
It's all right, Adam.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.581
It's all right.
Just slow him down, okay?

33:37.583 --> 33:39.350
Just slow him down.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.118
They tell you
to say all that?
No, it was me.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.586
I thought
that was you talking.
I'm sorry.

33:42.588 --> 33:43.888
I thought that was my friend.

33:43.889 --> 33:45.189
I was just trying
to get us out of this.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.490
I thought
I could trust you.
Donnie.

33:46.492 --> 33:49.026
ED:
Boss?
Adam, we're done. Walk away.

33:49.028 --> 33:51.261
Stop listening to them!
Put the gun down.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.096
Get away.
You think I won't do it?

33:53.098 --> 33:54.564
I<i> know</i> you won't do it!

33:54.566 --> 33:56.666
Donnie, please.

33:56.668 --> 33:57.801
Sierra 1.

33:57.803 --> 33:58.802
I've got the solution.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.337
Donnie, give it to me.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.572
It's over.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.808
Donnie, give it to me.
It's over!
No!

34:04.810 --> 34:06.676
(gasps)
Scorpio.

34:12.785 --> 34:14.551
Get out of my face.

34:14.553 --> 34:15.619
(both grunting)

34:15.621 --> 34:17.187
No solution. No solution.

34:17.189 --> 34:18.488
You liar!

34:18.490 --> 34:20.557
Donnie!

34:20.559 --> 34:22.325
Subject's on the move.
Sam, we're going down.

34:22.327 --> 34:23.493
Where are you going?

34:23.495 --> 34:24.528
Entry Team, go!

34:28.167 --> 34:29.266
(panting)

34:39.511 --> 34:41.411
In pursuit.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.212
Copy.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.213
Hands on your head!

34:43.215 --> 34:45.682
Hands on your head right now!

34:45.684 --> 34:47.184
(muffled groaning)

34:47.186 --> 34:48.351
Stay down!

34:48.353 --> 34:49.719
He's lost a
lot of blood.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.154
I trusted you.

34:51.156 --> 34:52.389
Donnie, listen.

34:52.391 --> 34:53.423
Adam, get back.
Get out of there.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.491
ADAM:
Oh, don't hurt him!

34:56.595 --> 34:57.895
You sold me out.
No, I didn't.

34:57.896 --> 34:59.196
I was trying to
get us out of this.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.298
Drop the gun!
Drop your weapon!

35:01.300 --> 35:02.432
Drop it!

35:02.434 --> 35:04.501
Put the gun down.

35:04.503 --> 35:06.603
Donnie, I need you
to put the gun down.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.105
Do it now.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.739
No. Let me talk to him.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.741
ED:
Put it down, son.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.643
Put it down.

35:13.645 --> 35:14.845
Put it down!

35:14.847 --> 35:16.279
No.
ADAM:
Please!

35:16.281 --> 35:17.581
He'll listen to me.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.516
He won't... He won't hurt me.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.185
He hasn't got
anybody else.

35:21.186 --> 35:22.853
Get out of here.
I got nothing to say to you.

35:22.855 --> 35:25.388
Go!
I'm not going anywhere.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.624
Donnie, it's gonna be okay.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.659
Oh, it's gonna be okay?

35:30.896 --> 35:33.463
Look at... Look at me.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.698
It's not.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.417
Boss?

35:36.418 --> 35:38.135
Team, Donnie's
at a breaking point here,

35:38.137 --> 35:39.736
and he's dangerous
to everyone in there. Now,

35:39.738 --> 35:41.671
we got one shot at this. Eddie,

35:41.673 --> 35:44.541
we got to save this kid
from himself here.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.143
So, it's your call, but I think

35:46.145 --> 35:48.178
we got to let Adam
talk to him again.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.479
(Donnie sobbing)

35:49.481 --> 35:51.481
Hey, Sam, that gun goes up,
it's over.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.382
Copy.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.684
Donnie?

35:54.686 --> 35:56.753
What am I going to do?

36:02.394 --> 36:03.760
What am I going to do?

36:03.762 --> 36:05.562
ED:
Son, don't do it.

36:05.564 --> 36:08.732
Don't do it, son. Son?

36:08.734 --> 36:11.301
Look, Donnie, it's me.

36:11.303 --> 36:12.903
Just me.

36:12.905 --> 36:16.640
Listen, I don't care
where we are--

36:16.642 --> 36:19.276
in Lethbridge, in jail.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.411
Doesn't make a difference.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.180
But you do this,

36:23.182 --> 36:26.416
it's all over.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.218
Remember?

36:28.220 --> 36:30.320
We're brothers.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.322
And brothers...

36:32.324 --> 36:34.324
need to be there
for each other.

36:34.326 --> 36:36.693
(inhales loudly)

36:36.695 --> 36:38.495
Always?

36:38.497 --> 36:40.830
Always.

36:40.832 --> 36:43.433
(sighs)

36:43.435 --> 36:45.835
Put the gun down.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.443
(gun clattering)

36:53.445 --> 36:56.746
That's it. That's it.

36:56.748 --> 36:57.881
(gasps)

36:59.418 --> 37:01.518
(handcuffs clicking)

37:06.625 --> 37:08.425
(handcuffs clicking)

37:08.427 --> 37:09.626
Yes.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.361
That's good work.

37:11.363 --> 37:12.963
That is good work.

37:22.541 --> 37:27.310

I just... I wanted to say
sorry for riding you so hard.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.782
I just had to know
that your...

38:38.784 --> 38:41.651
that your head's in
the game, that's all.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.852
No problem.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.422
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.757
Sam?

38:47.759 --> 38:50.894
My girlfriend is gonna
break up with me tonight.

38:50.896 --> 38:51.895
I didn't know
you were seeing anybody.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.063
Yeah, well.

38:53.065 --> 38:54.497
Anyway.

38:54.499 --> 38:55.832
You want to grab a beer first?

38:55.834 --> 38:57.634
No, I can't.
Come on. I'm buying.

38:57.636 --> 38:58.935
Rain check.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.603
All right, tomorrow night.

39:00.605 --> 39:01.871
Actually...

39:01.873 --> 39:03.940
Tomorrow.

39:03.942 --> 39:07.877
Okay. That'd be good.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.881

39:13.385 --> 39:14.951
Maybe they weren't meant to be.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.854
You know what? They never really
looked like a couple to me.

39:17.856 --> 39:21.891
How'd you know
there was something up?

39:21.893 --> 39:22.959
I figured it out.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.728
How'd you do that?

39:24.730 --> 39:25.862
Because I'm special that way.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.597
(both laugh)

39:27.599 --> 39:29.933
Yes, you are.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.935
Yes, you are.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.671
Let me buy you a soda.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.877
It's not if, it's<i> when</i> I'm going
to go back on the team, Sam.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.879
Okay, so, the boss knows.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.482
Right, which is

39:45.484 --> 39:48.051
exactly why we can't be together
if I'm gonna go back.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.486
You know that.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.920
(sighs)

39:50.922 --> 39:52.956
I love you, Sam, but

39:52.958 --> 39:56.926
I've worked my whole life
for this job and the team,

39:56.928 --> 39:59.863
and I'm not gonna let
getting shot stand in the way

39:59.865 --> 40:01.931
of me going back.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.666
You mean<i> I'm</i> not going
to stand in your way?

40:03.668 --> 40:06.169
Jules,

40:06.171 --> 40:08.738
that's the first time
you told me you loved me.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.607
I didn't think
it would be like this.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.842
Sam...
Look, I get it.

40:12.844 --> 40:16.780
I get it. I do.

40:16.782 --> 40:18.148
