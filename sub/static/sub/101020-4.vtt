WEBVTT

00:11.553 --> 00:12.429
Uh...

00:13.013 --> 00:16.057
-Maybe your parents rolled into town?
-They're in Dubai till end of the year.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.642
Maybe you pissed off the landlord.

00:17.726 --> 00:18.601
I am the landlord.

00:18.685 --> 00:21.312
The only other person
who knows that stuff was here

00:21.396 --> 00:22.313
is your thief demon.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.941
She's not ours, she's her own demon.

00:25.025 --> 00:29.070
-But she was working for us. We paid her.
-Yeah, in underpants.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.197
You're not dealing with a healthy psyche.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.454
This looks like it could work.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.041
You brought me a contamination spell.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.667
I asked for a containment spell!

00:42.751 --> 00:43.877
I'm sorry, Grand Magus.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.546
I understand you're a transplant
from our West Coast temple,

00:46.629 --> 00:49.174
but I assume they still teach people
how to read in California?

00:49.257 --> 00:51.676
-Yes, Grand Magus.
-Then find me a containment spell!

00:52.385 --> 00:55.555
This incantation could be used
as a containment spell.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.599
The sacrifice requirements
are kinda messy.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.770
Start the prep work, Miss Drake.
You'll be leading this incantation.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.355
Actually, I don't think I should.

01:05.398 --> 01:06.274
Why not?

01:06.691 --> 01:08.443
My spell casting has been
off-kilter lately.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.695
<i>Anaplerosi.</i>

01:14.240 --> 01:15.366
<i>Anaplerosi.</i>

01:23.208 --> 01:24.292
Miss Dupres!

01:24.375 --> 01:26.002
Start the preparations.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.378
You'll be leading this spell.

01:28.213 --> 01:31.382
Maybe there's some other way
that I could help?

01:31.841 --> 01:32.884
I could use a salad.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.427
Find me those four acolytes.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.222
I could use some magic practitioners
with a little extra right now.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.848
Right away, Grand Magus.

01:42.352 --> 01:45.730
Zecchia, we command you, appear before us.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.692
For fuck's sake, you again?

01:50.235 --> 01:52.445
And you added a demon trap? Not cool.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.824
-Thought you didn't use that word.
-No, you can't use that word.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.367
-Thank you.
-Where's our stuff?

01:57.992 --> 02:01.830
You mean, where's that stuff that
passed through your possession briefly?

02:01.913 --> 02:03.248
Don't make us ask twice.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.043
Oh, sweet boy.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.255
You do not want to fuck with me.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.924
We just want our stuff back, please.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.593
Guys, the demon trap isn't working.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.345
It's working, you hairless chimp.

02:17.428 --> 02:20.431
The trap only tethers me to this dump,
not that circle.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.102
So now, your slave,

02:24.644 --> 02:28.690
who was busy living her own damn life
before you yanked her back here,

02:28.773 --> 02:31.901
is standing by to fix all of your mistakes

02:32.610 --> 02:34.237
till you say I can go.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.906
Woo-fucking-hoo.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.783
We did something wrong with the summoning.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.119
Ding, ding, ding.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.205
The guy who appreciates our differences

02:44.289 --> 02:47.917
wasn't present for the summoning,
but was present for the assigning.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.210
So, contract...

02:49.294 --> 02:50.378
null...

02:50.461 --> 02:51.588
and...

02:51.671 --> 02:52.505
void.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.341
Oh, dear God, no. Please stop.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.676
Stop! Just...

02:58.303 --> 02:59.804
We'll get you to steal it all again.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.432
The party who acquired
the artifacts from you

03:02.515 --> 03:05.101
did aÂ fealty sacrifice that
prevents me from stealing it again.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.979
So just tell us who they are,
and we'll sort it out ourselves.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.272
Mm-mm.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.691
No can do. Demon-client confidentiality.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.194
Again, not to say "I told you so,"

03:14.277 --> 03:17.697
but I told you guys
it was gonna go like this.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.537
Ah!

03:24.621 --> 03:25.622
Delish.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.081
Again.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.458
Whoa! Wait, hold up. Hold up.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.876
You give us something,

03:30.293 --> 03:31.336
then you get another drink.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.171
Fine.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.342
Don't ask for the same old thing, though.
Try to be smart this time.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.386
We are so smart.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.014
You know, why don't we just
ask for the weapons back?

03:43.097 --> 03:45.558
No way, we need it all back.
That's how we get out of the Order.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.144
If we can't ask who,
maybe we can ask where?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.063
Like, longitude, latitude?

03:50.146 --> 03:52.607
She'll still find a way to screw us over.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.984
No, she screwed us once, all right?
But now we're ready.

03:55.526 --> 03:57.153
Nothing can go wrong this time.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.080
That doesn't look like our weapons,
you idiots!

04:12.168 --> 04:13.461
You said you had the sickles.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.089
We did, all right?
Well, we thought we did, but then...

04:16.464 --> 04:18.549
So you summoned a demon
to help you find them?

04:18.633 --> 04:20.510
We summoned her
to find out where she took them.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.388
A demon robbed you
after you robbed the Order?

04:23.471 --> 04:26.599
No, more like she robbed the Order for us,
then she double-crossed us.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.060
Oh, my God, how could you be so stupid?

04:29.143 --> 04:29.978
I don't know.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.647
Maybe I'm brain-damaged
from the insane amount of <i>pulvis memoriae</i>

04:32.730 --> 04:33.731
you forced me to inhale.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.526
We're in the middle of a demon crisis,
and you summoned a demon?

04:36.609 --> 04:37.694
I could take her.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.320
No, you couldn't.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.824
Uh, do you mind? We're in the middle
of a private conversation here.

04:43.491 --> 04:44.325
Good to know.

04:47.912 --> 04:52.000
That thief demon is probably
only a president.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.962
I'm a baron, Miss Know-It-All.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.173
Which means you're a nothing burger.

05:00.591 --> 05:02.510
A baron demon can only manipulate things.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.429
An emperor manipulates people.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.514
Rogwan is an emperor demon.

05:06.597 --> 05:07.557
Rogwan is coming?

05:11.644 --> 05:13.062
I can't wait to see this.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.274
You guys are so fucked.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.364
Tell them about Rogwan.

05:24.032 --> 05:24.949
Go ahead.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.119
Oh, look at it this way.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.787
I'm Rogwan,

05:30.371 --> 05:33.291
and this... is the Earth,

05:33.374 --> 05:35.543
and all the humans who infest it.

05:44.886 --> 05:45.928
Oh, you're killing me.

05:46.012 --> 05:46.846
Mm, no.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.181
You're killing you,

05:48.264 --> 05:50.475
and she'll kill him,
and he'll kill himself,

05:50.558 --> 05:53.144
because that's how
the Emperor of Fear rolls.

05:53.227 --> 05:55.938
-Demons kill people. Big deal.
- No, dummy.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.277
You humans are full of fear,

06:01.361 --> 06:05.198
and you think that it's some bad shit
that you need to overcome,

06:05.281 --> 06:08.076
but fear is the gift that keeps
humanity in check.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.079
Fear makes you pay attention
so you stay alive.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.915
Not for much longer.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.501
We need to get that shit back.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.753
No, you need to come to the temple.
Vera's expecting you.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.339
If there's a chance we can get
the sickles back, we must take it.

06:21.422 --> 06:25.343
My only choice is protect the Order
or work with a demon?

06:25.802 --> 06:27.512
Think of it as protecting humanity.

06:27.595 --> 06:28.679
You okay with that?

06:29.722 --> 06:30.890
I like humanity.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.392
Great. We'll go to the temple.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.726
Jack, Lilith,

06:33.810 --> 06:34.769
find the sickles.

06:34.852 --> 06:35.853
Jack.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.897
Don't fuck this up.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.232
Oh, man.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.818
If she's doing the swears,
Rogwan must be bad.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.903
You have no idea.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.619
You want to get a head start
on the apocalypse?

06:51.702 --> 06:53.871
We are not getting those sickles back.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.957
Whoever plundered my vault is long gone,

06:56.040 --> 06:59.627
so our only advantage lies
in throwing Rogwan off balance.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.421
So you'll summon him

07:01.504 --> 07:04.632
out of the demon realm earlier
than he expected, and he'll be, what?

07:05.716 --> 07:07.051
Be disoriented?

07:08.970 --> 07:11.013
-I'm just trying to understand.
-Okay.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.266
We summon him into a demon trap.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.309
That's our first advantage.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.854
-He's an emperor demon.
-Uh-huh.

07:17.937 --> 07:21.732
Which is why we then hit him
with the Celtic paralysis spell, and then

07:21.816 --> 07:25.319
we add a Zoroastrian binding incantation

07:25.403 --> 07:26.988
to keep him locked inside of the temple.

07:27.071 --> 07:30.324
It's not ideal,
but at least if he can't leave,

07:30.408 --> 07:33.077
then our grisly deaths won't be in vain.

07:35.746 --> 07:36.998
There's another option.

07:39.709 --> 07:40.626
The Excidium.

07:44.046 --> 07:46.048
Um, I thought that was an urban legend.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.134
-Mm.
-If it's real,

07:48.217 --> 07:49.927
why don't I have access to it?

07:50.011 --> 07:53.931
Usually it's only the Grand Magus
and Adeptus Superior who have it.

07:54.223 --> 07:56.559
But I made some good friends in Brazil--

07:56.642 --> 07:57.685
I should have it!

07:58.227 --> 07:59.228
Well--

07:59.312 --> 08:02.815
Say "Acting Grand Magus" one more time,
I will make you my first sacrifice.

08:03.608 --> 08:04.442
Please.

08:04.859 --> 08:05.776
Excidium?

08:06.152 --> 08:07.737
It could easily destroy Rogwan.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.114
It could destroy several emperor demons.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.326
Along with the entire university
and a good chunk of Norwich.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.078
And Rogwan would have to be
inside the temple.

08:17.246 --> 08:20.291
It's a decision that can't be made
by an acting--

08:22.710 --> 08:24.253
It can't be your decision.

08:25.129 --> 08:27.340
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.843
Would you like to summon
the rest of the Gnostic Council

08:30.927 --> 08:33.095
and see if they're comfortable
with you making that call?

08:34.722 --> 08:36.265
Like I said,

08:36.349 --> 08:38.267
I believe in you, Vera.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.562
I have the spell right here.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.317
You keep the Excidium on your phone?

08:47.235 --> 08:48.402
I have two passwords.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.660
The elements you requested have arrived,
Grand Magus.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.791
Oh, so you were going to go ahead
with your plan, regardless of my opinion?

09:01.874 --> 09:03.459
We really have no other choice.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.795
Why is Rogwan so terrible?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.714
Losing your fears means
losing your inhibitions,

09:09.215 --> 09:10.800
and that sounds amazing.

09:10.883 --> 09:14.011
Well, once you lose all of your fear,

09:14.637 --> 09:17.098
you have then lost the fear of dying.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.017
And then Rogwan owns you.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.021
Bring in the goats.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.606
Make sure the knives are sharp.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.774
Yes, Grand Magus.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.943
Nicky! Fetch the goats.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.194
But I thought...

09:32.280 --> 09:33.739
Juniper and Ivy?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.366
I told you not to name them.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.452
We'll call Rogwan early.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.664
We'll hit him with the paralysis
and the binding spell.

09:42.832 --> 09:43.791
If those fail...

09:45.001 --> 09:46.377
we perform the Excidium.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.422
Hopefully we'll get lucky.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.718
Well, he's not Brazilian,
he's a demon, so...

09:56.262 --> 09:59.265
Can we get going?
I have a life to attend to.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.726
Come on, we got to make sure
we get this perfect.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.895
I told you I'm willing
to forego the ritual.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.023
Just ask me what you want,
and then I'll do it.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.357
What about your price?

10:08.941 --> 10:11.360
Hamish made me that delicious cocktail.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.029
We'll call it even.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.697
And your fealty sacrifice?

10:15.114 --> 10:16.699
I did eat all those cherries.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.203
That covers payments.
We're good to go.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.204
I hope so.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.337
Zecchia,

10:29.837 --> 10:32.798
retrace your steps backwards in time
until we are satisfied.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.426
You're making me retrace my steps?

10:35.509 --> 10:38.220
Till we're satisfied.
Don't forget about that part.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.847
Okay. Let's go.

10:40.598 --> 10:41.557
How does this work?

10:42.266 --> 10:44.727
Break apart our atoms
and reconstitute them, or--

10:46.646 --> 10:47.563
What is this?

10:48.147 --> 10:50.441
The last place I was
before you resummoned me.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.569
A hidey-hole filled with magic artifacts.

10:54.153 --> 10:54.987
Happy?

10:55.071 --> 10:56.781
No, that doesn't answer my question.

10:56.864 --> 10:59.450
Where are we?
Are we still in North America?

10:59.533 --> 11:01.535
You're getting good at this.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.038
You're 50 miles from Belgrave.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.375
So, am I done? Can I go live my life?

11:07.458 --> 11:09.293
-Looks good.
-Contract fulfilled.

11:10.961 --> 11:12.129
All right.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.131
Let's find the sickles
and get back to the temple,

11:14.215 --> 11:16.008
and then we'll figure out
the rest of this.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.305
I am so sorry, Juniper.

11:21.931 --> 11:22.807
Don't be.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.809
She's going to make amazing stew.

11:29.313 --> 11:30.398
Where are the other two?

11:30.481 --> 11:32.024
They were gone by the time I got there.

11:32.108 --> 11:32.983
Where did they go?

11:33.943 --> 11:35.319
They went to find the sickles.

11:35.778 --> 11:39.323
That was very thoughtful of them,
but that's not what I asked for.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.409
There was nothing I could do.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.744
It's becoming a common refrain for you.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.996
You, over there. You, here with me.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.041
Miss Drake, why don't you circulate
the water and lozenges?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.459
We're gonna be here for a while.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.674
It's time.

11:57.633 --> 11:58.551
Start the summoning.

12:08.686 --> 12:12.815
<i>Emerge et praesta te nobis.</i>

12:13.190 --> 12:16.694
<i>Emerge et praesta te nobis. </i>

12:17.153 --> 12:18.028
Any luck?

12:18.571 --> 12:19.530
Not yet.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.950
Oh, I can't wait till we're finally out.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.369
I'm beginning to wonder
if that'll ever happen.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.831
Once we help them beat Rogwan,

12:28.914 --> 12:30.791
we'll be as deep in it as we've ever been.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.877
Except we'll have the upper hand.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.925
Do you think what Randall said is right?

12:40.926 --> 12:44.221
That what happened to us in
the fear corridor is actually a prophecy?

12:44.805 --> 12:48.225
Hey, if there's one thing that I learned
from those insane necromancers,

12:48.976 --> 12:50.352
our fate is not set in stone.

12:51.812 --> 12:52.855
So...

12:54.106 --> 12:56.776
It's just, everyone you love dies.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.778
-Yeah, pretty much.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.488
I don't see these sickles anywhere.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.917
You made a big mistake breaking in.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.172
I know you're in here.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.926
I can feel your footsteps.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.807
Enchanted ground?

13:28.307 --> 13:29.391
That's a new one.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.856
Surrender now if you want to live.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.067
They always say that
right before they kill you.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.068
Time to go.

14:14.770 --> 14:19.567
Rogwan, <i>emerge et praesta te nobis.</i>

14:19.650 --> 14:23.195
<i>Emerge et praesta te nobis.</i>

14:23.279 --> 14:26.699
<i>Emerge et praesta te nobis.</i>

14:31.829 --> 14:32.997
Now! Go, now.

14:33.956 --> 14:37.585
<i>Membra huius beluae obtorpescantur!</i>

14:44.133 --> 14:45.885
You summoned me early.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.095
No one's ever tried that before.

14:48.929 --> 14:49.763
Original.

14:50.598 --> 14:51.432
Skull.

14:57.104 --> 14:59.565
<i>Ad hunc locum planumque ligaris.</i>

14:59.648 --> 15:00.733
The binding spell?

15:01.442 --> 15:03.861
There's only one reason
you'd be this desperate.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.071
<i>Ad hunc locum planumque ligaris.</i>

15:06.155 --> 15:08.324
<i>âª You lost the sicklesÂ âª</i>

15:17.917 --> 15:19.752
You did your best, Grand Magus.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.132
- Grand Magus, no!
- Oh, God.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.012
But this has been a long time coming.

15:34.725 --> 15:35.559
Oh!

15:36.477 --> 15:38.103
Mm-mm-mm.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.688
So much fear.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.983
So many varieties.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.200
Fear of me.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.618
So dull.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.536
No, we can do better.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.913
We can do...

15:57.289 --> 15:58.248
better.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.291
Hmm.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.213
Fear of disappointment.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.592
No, no, wait.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.679
Fear of disappointing others.

16:11.762 --> 16:15.099
Oh, it's so strong in you.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.936
So strong.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.022
Let me help you with that.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.030
Mmm. Mmm.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.746
Oh, that is delicious.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.584
I'm not afraid of you.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.629
That's the idea.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.097
Now if you'll excuse me,

16:55.389 --> 16:58.017
-I have a lot of work to do.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.234
What does it feel like?

17:11.447 --> 17:12.573
You tell me.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.766
If I'm still alive, it means
you failed to perform the Excidium.

17:39.349 --> 17:42.728
I didn't even have a chance to prepare it.
He just walked right out of the temple.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.146
We'll have to lure him back.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.105
How?

17:45.189 --> 17:47.191
Just let the damned wolves out.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.318
They'll bring him back.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.196
You may go, Miss Drake.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.324
Of course. You bet.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.950
I hate your hair.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.622
Prepare the Excidium.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.083
Print me a copy of the incantation.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.586
At once, Grand Magus.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.342
So what's all this talk about wolves?

18:13.425 --> 18:16.261
Yeah, I am so confused.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.387
Drop the act.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.892
This is not a regional theater,
and you are not auditioning.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.310
You know?

18:23.393 --> 18:25.687
I suspected as soon as
my vault was cleared out.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.482
You confirmed it as soon as
Alyssa mentioned werewolves.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.234
Neither of you should ever play poker.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.862
If I wasn't so furious,
I might even be a little impressed.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.031
Where is my inventory?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.951
-It was stolen from us.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.205
I'm seriously considering
killing both of you right now.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.498
Trust me, the feeling's mutual.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.250
-He's exaggerating.
-Not at all.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.501
Fortunately for you,

18:47.584 --> 18:50.295
I'm a little more concerned
with preventing the end of the world.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.381
Fortunately for you, I'm...

18:52.464 --> 18:55.092
Yeah. That we can agree on.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.094
Great. That's great. So,

18:57.511 --> 19:02.558
we will have to agree to replace
your old lie with my new one.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.394
You are still...

19:05.477 --> 19:10.149
loyal disciples with no memories
of being the Knights of Saint Christopher.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.359
But as soon as you leave this room,

19:12.442 --> 19:15.696
I will have endowed you
with astounding werewolf powers.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.781
So we get to be werewolves again?

19:17.865 --> 19:21.201
Mm-hmm. Yeah, to bring Rogwan back
to the temple, it's our only chance.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.203
-We won't let you down.
-Too late.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.168
You are so hot for teacher.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.795
It's an end of the world thing, buddy.
You wouldn't understand.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.116
- Don't go to the window!

20:01.700 --> 20:03.952
Mmm.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.582
-Mmm.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.542
Exams.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.003
Worry not.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.672
-Soon, your suffering will be over.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.468
Randall, third floor!

20:33.190 --> 20:35.567
Werewolf! Well...

20:36.443 --> 20:37.569
This is new.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.160
Hmm.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.662
Oh.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.622
Centuries of terror.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.044
Being hunted, tortured, killed...

20:55.254 --> 20:56.755
It's astounding you're alive at all.

21:04.221 --> 21:08.558
I can't wait to see the havoc you create
without any fear to stop you.

21:28.078 --> 21:31.540
You fools, don't you see?
You're in danger!

21:34.751 --> 21:36.586
-This is fucked up.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.963
I don't see any people around.

21:43.135 --> 21:43.969
Chad?

21:44.177 --> 21:45.095
Nailed it.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.140
Triple full twist.

21:54.771 --> 21:55.981
Film me next time, will you?

22:00.610 --> 22:02.487
You shouldn't be
walking on that ankle, man.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.072
You're not getting my spot, Morton.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.785
Holy shit!

22:10.829 --> 22:12.247
I guess Rogwan got through.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.212
On the bright side,

22:19.880 --> 22:21.048
Randall's alive.

22:26.386 --> 22:27.429
Guys.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.681
Hey, you guys got my text.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.809
We weren't sure if you guys were back yet.

22:34.102 --> 22:37.397
Guys, relax, it's just a dart in his eye.

22:38.815 --> 22:41.151
See? Healing already.
I love being a werewolf.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.527
Hey. Shh. Shh.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.363
What, it's not a problem.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.782
Hey, I'm a werewolf.

22:46.865 --> 22:47.949
Congratulations.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.827
See? Doesn't scare, doesn't care.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.371
What did Rogwan do to you?

22:52.454 --> 22:53.622
He freed us.

22:53.705 --> 22:57.250
Did you know there are centuries
of pent-up anguish inside our hides?

22:57.334 --> 22:59.419
Rogwan cleaned house like that!

23:00.003 --> 23:01.463
Better than therapy.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.631
He took your fear.

23:02.714 --> 23:07.010
Ate it, loved it, wouldn't shut up
about how delicious it was.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.221
Apparently, werewolf fear isÂ just...

23:10.722 --> 23:12.265
You should get him to do you guys.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.809
-Fearlessness is amazing.
-Oh.

23:13.892 --> 23:17.062
Also amazing, Vera knows
we have our memories back. What!

23:17.145 --> 23:18.980
No one else is supposed to know, though.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.525
-Poor Vera. Still so fearful.
-Mm.

23:21.608 --> 23:22.692
So how'd it go with Zecchia?

23:22.776 --> 23:24.653
-Uh...
-We... We...

23:24.736 --> 23:27.447
We didn't get the sickles,
but the four of us can go back.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.116
It's just right off Taverner Road.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.660
No, it was Rural Route 1.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.495
I saw the signs when we turned east.

23:33.787 --> 23:34.788
I thought it was west.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.873
-Uh...
-Shit.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.293
Of course the place is protected by magic.

23:40.836 --> 23:43.004
Sounds like we're screwed.

23:43.088 --> 23:47.092
I know I'm supposed to be concerned
for the fate of humanity, but... eh.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.344
Wait.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.887
I know what we should do.

23:51.346 --> 23:52.305
Jump off a bridge!

23:52.389 --> 23:53.557
Get out of my head!

23:53.640 --> 23:54.558
Not a good idea.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.275
Guys, guys, help!

24:04.109 --> 24:06.361
-Shit!
-I think I know what Vera's afraid of.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.450
What will do
about Randall and Hamish?

24:11.533 --> 24:13.660
They're the least of our worries.
They'll heal.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.831
No, I won't be home
for your Thanksgiving charity dinner.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.875
I'm tired of being second-class-citizened

24:19.958 --> 24:23.336
at that particular
<i>Vanity Fair</i> photo op bullshit!

24:23.753 --> 24:26.756
And by the way, everyone knows
you had your ass lifted.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.346
That was the most glorious
seven minutes of my life.

24:34.639 --> 24:37.517
Want to see if we can make it
the second-best seven minutes?

24:38.351 --> 24:39.436
Uh... Um...

24:39.519 --> 24:40.979
I see you've met Rogwan.

24:42.189 --> 24:45.317
Nothing holds me back anymore.
I'm free to do whatever I want.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.989
Okay, don't take all day.

24:52.532 --> 24:55.869
Oh, God,
you're still so stupidly kissable.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.329
Thank you.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.916
But together we are a hot mess, okay?
It's like...

25:02.334 --> 25:04.836
It's like a game of Fuck, Marry, Kill,
and you're all three.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.797
But I will not allow you to compel me
away from what I want for my life.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.633
And that's what?

25:10.383 --> 25:11.384
Grand Magus.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.554
How can you not remember that?

25:14.638 --> 25:17.307
Okay, Alyssa,
is Vera still trying to stop Rogwan?

25:17.390 --> 25:20.810
She's got some Hail Mary idea
that probably won't work.

25:21.436 --> 25:24.397
You know the first day I saw you,
I wanted to kiss you?

25:24.481 --> 25:25.815
I did not. Um...

25:26.316 --> 25:27.776
Let's go to the temple. Come with us.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.694
It'll look good
on your Grand Magus application.

25:29.778 --> 25:30.737
I can't help.

25:31.321 --> 25:34.199
My magic is totes fucked.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.952
Plus, I really wanna call
my sister Jennica.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.745
Come to the temple with us.

25:38.828 --> 25:40.038
Yeah, yeah, fine.

25:44.042 --> 25:44.960
Jennica?

25:45.210 --> 25:46.127
Fuck you.

25:47.712 --> 25:50.131
We were nearly finished here,
and then Vera told us to leave.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.299
You need to come with me.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.718
I'll be right behind you, okay? I promise.

25:53.802 --> 25:54.886
There's nothing you can do.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.429
You could give us a hand.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.684
Everything we tried
failed in a matter of seconds.

26:00.767 --> 26:01.810
He's too strong.

26:02.185 --> 26:05.397
I seem to remember you telling me
that I was a natural at this.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.773
I take it back.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.526
You're a terrible practitioner.
You're the worst I've ever seen.

26:09.609 --> 26:11.570
Hey, you have nothing to worry about.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.698
I've already helped save the world
once before this.

26:14.781 --> 26:15.991
This will be kids' stuff.

26:16.241 --> 26:19.244
Nobody's leaving unless
the array is completed now.

26:22.706 --> 26:23.748
I'll catch up with you.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.083
You better.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.388
Mr. Morton.

26:38.847 --> 26:39.973
Grand Magus.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.058
You want to help.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.477
You've done enough already.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.732
None of this would have happened
if you had just stuck to our agreement.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.318
If you're only here
to wallow in your victory,

26:52.110 --> 26:52.944
please leave.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.155
I have work to do.

26:56.531 --> 26:57.824
I thought it was hopeless.

26:58.325 --> 27:01.453
Well... doesn't mean you stop trying.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.830
Even if the price is too high.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.832
What is Kepler setting up
in the temple, anyway?

27:06.875 --> 27:07.709
A bomb.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.129
Wha...?

27:11.212 --> 27:12.380
The temple is a bomb?

27:13.340 --> 27:14.257
Not by design.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.302
But magic is an energy.

27:17.385 --> 27:22.182
Just like any other energy,Â it can be
absorbed, stored, stabilized, and...

27:22.807 --> 27:24.517
made to reach a critical mass.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.728
So this Excidium spell,

27:26.811 --> 27:28.104
it blocks the flow of magic,

27:28.188 --> 27:29.397
and then it blows.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.442
It's like a magic Chernobyl.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.528
Congratulations, Mr. Morton,

27:35.612 --> 27:38.657
you finally found
an accurate analogy for magic.

27:39.741 --> 27:43.078
But if Rogwan's not at the epicenter,
it still might not kill him.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.537
We have no choice.

27:44.954 --> 27:47.457
You're going to blow this place up
even though it might not work?

27:47.832 --> 27:49.376
Definition of a Hail Mary.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.673
Maybe we could advertise a fear buffet
and draw Rogwan back here.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.383
This isn't a joke.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.385
Lilith's right.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.553
I mean, Rogwan is drawn to fear.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.598
He can sense it,
and he's almost fussy about it.

28:05.141 --> 28:06.101
Total snob.

28:06.726 --> 28:07.686
Worse than Edward.

28:07.977 --> 28:11.189
And the fear corridor amplifies our fears
when we're going through it.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.733
Randall and Hamish said
he loved werewolf fear.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.737
-Well, I give my life to the cause.
-To the cause.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.910
Care to share with the group?

28:24.577 --> 28:26.705
We'll go into the fear corridor
as werewolves,

28:26.788 --> 28:28.998
and we will stay there
no matter what happens.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.419
Hopefully Rogwan gets the message,

28:33.044 --> 28:34.671
and then it draws him back here.

28:38.842 --> 28:42.220
I gotta to tell you, I never thought
this is how I'd go out.

28:42.303 --> 28:46.266
On the bright side, as soon as he takes
our fear, we won't be afraid to die.

28:46.975 --> 28:47.851
Yeah.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.270
Yeah, that makes this so much better.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.446
Vera says she's ready when you are.

29:03.366 --> 29:04.200
Um...

29:05.827 --> 29:06.745
Jack.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.413
Lilith.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.751
I just want to say that
we're all going to die.

29:13.209 --> 29:16.004
-Figured that out already.
-Will you shut up and let me finish?

29:17.338 --> 29:19.466
We're all going to die, and...

29:21.885 --> 29:24.345
I don't feel any fear, but...

29:27.223 --> 29:28.850
I still feel regret.

29:34.689 --> 29:37.317
Uh... Okay.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.527
You were my best friend...

29:42.405 --> 29:44.574
and I failed you
when you needed me the most.

29:45.241 --> 29:48.536
And now I'll never get the chance
to make it up to you, but I just...

29:50.288 --> 29:52.290
I just want to say that I'm really sorry.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.350
Jack.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.860
We're so not right for each other.

30:21.736 --> 30:22.695
I know.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.532
-But I don't care.

30:26.783 --> 30:27.617
I don't.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.330
And I hate how I ruined things between us.

30:45.677 --> 30:46.886
If we do...

30:47.929 --> 30:49.514
make it out of this,

30:50.056 --> 30:52.141
can I please take you to the mall?

30:52.225 --> 30:54.435
'Cause I really hate your jean jacket.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.105
And your hair sucks.

30:58.648 --> 30:59.524
Yeah.

31:00.567 --> 31:01.526
Promise.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.278
We should go.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.159
Uh...

31:18.918 --> 31:19.961
It's, uh...

31:20.044 --> 31:23.339
I guess it's good to get all the feels
out of the way before you die.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.676
Yeah, I wish I had that chance with Pete.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.613
Well, it's been a slice,

31:47.405 --> 31:50.825
watching you go from vomiting noob
to professional hit-wolf.

31:51.618 --> 31:52.452
I love you, too.

31:52.952 --> 31:53.870
I know.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.164
You did not just Han Solo me.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.474
Everything's in place.

32:20.897 --> 32:21.731
Then go.

32:23.232 --> 32:25.693
If I fail here,
you'll have a second shot at him,

32:26.235 --> 32:28.363
provided you can lure him
to the DC temple.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.240
If it still exists after this.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.745
It feels wrong to go.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.500
Please. I heard you arranging
for your friend's helicopter

32:40.583 --> 32:42.669
-to pick you up in the concourse.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.379
Take as many disciples as you can.

32:44.462 --> 32:45.296
Shotgun.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.258
This could work, Magus.

32:50.176 --> 32:52.595
<i>Grand</i> Magus.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.028
Rats in a sinking ship, huh?

33:13.157 --> 33:14.659
You're a good Grand Magus.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.787
I would have been a great Grand Magus.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.915
You showed some promise.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.251
Please.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.712
You consider me yourÂ protÃ©gÃ©.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.547
I don't play favorites.

33:27.630 --> 33:28.881
You did with Jack.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.843
Yes. Well...

33:33.594 --> 33:35.513
I guess we're both guilty of that.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.436
Well, my magic sucks,

33:41.728 --> 33:44.647
but I've got nowhere else to be,

33:45.106 --> 33:46.482
if you want some company.

33:52.822 --> 33:53.823
Flip the pages.

34:03.416 --> 34:05.126
Fear of insignificance.

34:05.626 --> 34:07.378
I mean, look at you.

34:07.712 --> 34:08.796
It's reality.

34:10.506 --> 34:12.300
-You have no idea.
-Hmm.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.845
-Everything's about to change.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.389
Not the way you're planning.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.099
-Hmm.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.392
Werewolf.

34:44.123 --> 34:45.083
What the hell?

34:54.300 --> 34:55.134
Lilith.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.429
Lilith.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.224
I'm here.

35:04.143 --> 35:06.187
-What the hell was that place?

35:06.604 --> 35:08.022
Rogwan's apocalypse?

35:08.272 --> 35:10.900
Seemed more like a vision of the future
where the Knights had failed,

35:10.983 --> 35:12.527
and the Order destroyed the planet.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.237
We both saw the same thing.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.406
That must be the Knights' greatest fear.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.409
We've really dropped the ball
on our training.

35:20.827 --> 35:21.786
Big time.

35:23.746 --> 35:24.580
But...

35:25.081 --> 35:26.916
this can't be the real vault.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.670
We know that the vault is empty.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.422
I think we're still
inside of the corridor.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.716
This is someone else's fear.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.219
But then shouldn't we be wolves?

35:38.302 --> 35:40.304
-Werewolves are scary.

35:40.388 --> 35:41.597
Maybe to mortals.

35:42.098 --> 35:44.308
Personally, I find you quite exquisite.

35:46.727 --> 35:48.729
We're here because he's shit scared of us.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.857
I don't have fear.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.568
I am fear!

36:03.035 --> 36:07.707
<i>Redi ad ista inferna in quorum genituses!</i>

36:10.585 --> 36:12.628
That's impossible. None of this is real.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.297
If your fear is real, these are real.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.599
Jack! The wall!

36:25.725 --> 36:26.642
I'm working on it!

36:47.371 --> 36:48.206
Lilith!

37:15.691 --> 37:16.567
Jack.

37:20.613 --> 37:21.739
Let me go.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.033
No!

37:26.035 --> 37:26.869
Hang on!

37:30.539 --> 37:31.415
Help!

37:35.586 --> 37:36.712
Someone help!

37:44.595 --> 37:47.098
Methinks I see thee now.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.433
Thou art so low,

37:49.517 --> 37:52.895
as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

37:53.479 --> 37:54.563
Nothing lower than that.

37:54.647 --> 37:58.776
Either my eyesight fails,
or thou lookest...

37:58.859 --> 38:01.445
pale... Pale! Pale!

38:01.529 --> 38:02.405
Get off!

38:05.574 --> 38:06.534
Hold on.

38:11.122 --> 38:11.956
Randall, no, no!

38:12.039 --> 38:14.041
-You're scared again!
-No! No!

38:16.460 --> 38:17.878
Rogwan must be gone.

38:18.337 --> 38:23.217
<i>Et pestem usque ad cineres ardeat.</i>

38:23.301 --> 38:26.137
Grand Magus, before we die, I want
to apologize for calling you a bitch.

38:26.220 --> 38:29.140
-Your fear is back.

38:29.223 --> 38:30.474
Your fear is back!

38:31.017 --> 38:35.354
<i>Hanc magiam relinquo! Carmen finiatur!</i>

38:36.063 --> 38:37.690
-Rogwan's gone!

38:37.773 --> 38:39.233
-Hamish's chickenshit again!
-We know.

38:39.692 --> 38:40.901
What did you do?

38:41.360 --> 38:42.862
It was Jack and Lilith.

38:43.237 --> 38:44.447
They beat him somehow.

38:46.449 --> 38:47.283
Jack.

38:48.701 --> 38:49.702
Where's Lilith?

38:57.209 --> 39:00.129
The word "hero" is overused,
but in this case, I'll accept it.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.883
-Listen, let's get a head start.

39:03.966 --> 39:04.842
No.

39:06.677 --> 39:07.511
Come on.

39:07.595 --> 39:08.679
It's tradition.

39:09.388 --> 39:11.265
No matter what happens,
we salute the fallen.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.642
Long the road, short the life.

39:14.852 --> 39:15.895
When she's dead.

39:17.980 --> 39:21.942
Jack said she was still alive
when Rogwan dragged her into Hell.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.153
Wow.

39:25.029 --> 39:29.325
Actually, Hell is Judeo-Christian
propaganda designed for deterrence.

39:29.408 --> 39:32.078
You can think of it more
as a transdimensional realm.

39:32.161 --> 39:33.120
Whatever.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.958
Until I see Timber's hide in a locker...

39:39.794 --> 39:41.670
which isn't going to happen.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.172
Okay.

39:46.717 --> 39:47.593
Until we know.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.856
Who else knows?

40:02.942 --> 40:05.277
That we broke into your precious vault,

40:06.028 --> 40:07.488
and that we have our memories back?

40:07.571 --> 40:09.824
Just watch your tone, disciple.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.786
No one else knows, Vera.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.916
You'll forgive me if I don't believe you.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.253
Then go get your fucking glove of truth
and use it on me.

40:22.336 --> 40:24.713
I doubt it would have
any real effect on you,

40:24.797 --> 40:26.424
and it was stolen.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.052
Why would you do something so stupid?

40:32.138 --> 40:34.473
We wanted to hit the Order
where it would hurt.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.059
We wanted you to pay
for stealing our memories.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.811
You wanted revenge.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.313
Wouldn't you?

40:43.399 --> 40:44.650
Was it really so bad...

40:45.568 --> 40:49.447
having all of the pain of your past
just gone?

40:49.530 --> 40:53.367
So erasing our lives is a kindness
in your world?

40:53.826 --> 40:55.786
-Yes.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.039
All right, well, what now?

41:00.875 --> 41:03.461
Well, as much as I would love to...

41:04.712 --> 41:06.589
I can't punish you.

41:07.882 --> 41:11.844
If anybody else finds out
that you engineered the theft,

41:12.595 --> 41:15.473
and that you have your memories back,
you'd be killed.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.018
So would I, if I was lucky.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.688
So it's mutually assured destruction?

41:23.981 --> 41:25.649
You haven't left me much choice.

41:27.902 --> 41:28.903
What about Lilith?

41:29.987 --> 41:33.449
Given your penchant
for ignoring my orders,

41:33.908 --> 41:35.743
maybe you'll listen to a warning.

41:36.535 --> 41:41.832
Any effort to enter the demon realm
is suicide.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.460
There has to be a way.

41:45.377 --> 41:46.921
If it's any consolation...

41:48.047 --> 41:52.384
I couldn't think of anyone better suited
to survive the demon realm than Lilith.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.971
There is a way, isn't there?

41:56.847 --> 41:58.432
Even if there was...

41:59.642 --> 42:01.060
it's gone now.

42:12.530 --> 42:16.617
"In accordance with the rules,
the Esoteric Sons of Prometheus

42:16.700 --> 42:19.578
formally demand an audience with
the Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose

42:19.662 --> 42:21.997
and hereby invoke parlay."

42:23.541 --> 42:24.792
You can read Enochian?

42:24.875 --> 42:26.293
Silverback can. What does it mean?

42:26.377 --> 42:27.461
What does "parlay" mean?

42:27.753 --> 42:28.879
It means...

42:28.963 --> 42:31.382
I knew who was behind all of this...

42:35.261 --> 42:37.179
and they think we should have a visit.
