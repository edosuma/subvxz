10:52.739 --> 10:54.610
That's great!
What did he leave me?

10:54.654 --> 10:57.265
A disaster zone. Somehow,
the garden opened up

10:57.308 --> 11:00.050
-and sucked Waverly in.
-Oh, good Lord.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.486
I should've known
that you weren't done

11:01.530 --> 11:04.707
adding to the official
Wynonna Earp Hot Mess file.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.623
Too bad that file
is long gone.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.800
Well... no.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.150
I hid it.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.545
Alright, a little help, please.

11:16.588 --> 11:17.677
No, it's not in there.

11:20.810 --> 11:23.683
I didn't want Dolls' stuff
to fall into the wrong hands.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.470
That's where you hid our
top-secret government files?

11:29.601 --> 11:31.386
Nobody ever uses this couch.

11:31.865 --> 11:32.953
What are we looking for?

11:34.650 --> 11:35.912
Demons running amuck.

11:35.956 --> 11:39.002
Uh, mystical portals
to another worldly realm.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.266
Towns getting evacuated.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.138
Like Maldito, New Mexico.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.400
Supernatural hellmouth

11:45.443 --> 11:47.924
where demonic shit
got so out of hand

11:47.968 --> 11:50.144
they just bombed it
to smithereens.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.014
"They" who?

11:52.320 --> 11:54.278
My former employer,
the Black Badge Division.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.759
And I thought my erotic
book club was extra.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.239
Shapiro, Eliza...

11:58.935 --> 12:01.024
Lucado, Greg. Lucado, Jeannie.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.417
Whole bunch of randoms.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.724
Dolls kept records
of his fallen colleagues.

12:06.334 --> 12:07.509
Oh, my God, guys.

12:13.384 --> 12:14.385
Gloria Valdez.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.780
How did she carve up your
wall if she's Val-dead?

12:21.915 --> 12:24.744
The Empress, feminine power,
strength from the mind.

12:24.787 --> 12:25.657
Okay.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.965
No, reshuffle, I want a do-over.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.662
Death is not a negative card.

12:30.706 --> 12:31.707
What?! It's death!

12:31.751 --> 12:33.491
This card represents
transition.

12:33.535 --> 12:34.754
A doorway.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.801
-I know it's frustrating.
-Oh, it's torture!

12:38.845 --> 12:40.542
Oh God, and when I find Wynonna,

12:40.585 --> 12:41.804
I'm going to torture her.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.327
You two are so cute.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.416
We could just jump
out of the train.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.636
I could save the Earps,
you could save Doc.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.116
In a way,

12:49.159 --> 12:51.074
that's the reason why
I tend to stay on this train.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.423
Yeah, he did kinda shoot you.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.599
Yeah. But then I drew
my own Empress card.

12:55.035 --> 12:58.299
And I realized this regal bitch
is so over the second-guessing.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.780
The battles, all the things
we did to each other.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.217
Outside the bedroom, I mean.

13:03.826 --> 13:06.089
Now, what we did to each other
in the bedroom? Woo, girl!

13:06.133 --> 13:07.917
-[Kate laughing]
-Yeah, neato.

13:10.964 --> 13:11.921
The Fool.

13:12.879 --> 13:13.836
A journey.

13:13.880 --> 13:14.924
Yeah, no shit!

13:14.968 --> 13:16.143
Not for you.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.802
No human could survive, but...

13:22.845 --> 13:23.890
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no,

13:23.933 --> 13:25.413
not that kind of journey.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.417
So what, she's like
some kind of scientist?

13:29.460 --> 13:31.114
Clearance level, classified.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.682
Stationed at facility...

13:33.725 --> 13:35.727
DX-16.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.817
Oh, oh! That's in the town
of Monument.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.384
This place is so condemned,
I won't even build condos there.

13:41.864 --> 13:42.734
I was out-bid.

13:44.258 --> 13:45.346
What about Jeremy?

13:45.389 --> 13:46.913
Do you think he might've
known Valdez?

13:46.956 --> 13:48.349
They both rock BBD lab coats.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.481
Could've been him that
carved that in the wall.

13:50.525 --> 13:51.613
He couldn't have used a pen?

13:52.266 --> 13:53.615
Pen drawer's full of knives.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.531
I'm a demon hunter,
not a Shakespeare.

13:56.574 --> 13:57.184
Mmm.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.317
Garden.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.103
The garden.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.409
[horn blaring]

14:05.453 --> 14:07.020
We're nearing the border
of the Ghost River Triangle,

14:07.063 --> 14:08.108
we have to do this now.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.631
Yeah, but...
You can't do this.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.024
I can't let you do this.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.374
Wherever Waverly is,
she's not safe.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.071
You have to get to her.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.900
How can I ever thank you?

14:17.944 --> 14:20.120
Consider naming
your first-born "Katie".

14:21.512 --> 14:22.731
Now back up.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.388
[suspenseful music]

14:31.174 --> 14:33.046
[electric zapping]

14:34.743 --> 14:35.744
Go!

14:38.225 --> 14:40.183
[pained groaning]

14:46.668 --> 14:47.799
Where's the other one!

14:50.541 --> 14:51.978
[growling]

14:52.021 --> 14:53.022
[guard screaming]

14:53.066 --> 14:54.763
There will probably be demons.

14:54.806 --> 14:57.113
And I don't have
my demon-killing gun,

14:57.157 --> 14:59.594
or team, or a clue.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.903
Monument's only
a couple hours away.

15:04.773 --> 15:06.209
But if you're there,
and the stairs are here,

15:06.253 --> 15:07.994
what happens if they reappear?

15:08.037 --> 15:09.778
We're just coming up
with cheers, now?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.128
Look, this other facility,

15:12.172 --> 15:13.956
it could have another way
into the garden.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.958
It actually said,
"garden question mark"?

15:16.002 --> 15:17.351
Listen, guys,

15:17.394 --> 15:19.657
I'm as curious as you are, okay?

15:19.701 --> 15:22.225
But I've gotten enough
people killed, or cursed,

15:22.269 --> 15:24.749
-or their faces ripped off.
-Represent.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.448
Nedley, you couldn't walk
to an outhouse right now

15:27.491 --> 15:29.232
even if it meant
deucing your pantaloons.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.974
Mercedes, I love ya,

15:32.018 --> 15:33.715
I loved the omelet,

15:34.150 --> 15:36.239
but I'm not sure you didn't
just intend to fatten us up

15:36.283 --> 15:37.719
in case you needed
to eat us later.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.547
-You know?
-Uh, ladies...

15:39.590 --> 15:41.375
Whoa! Nedley! Nedley! Hey!

15:42.115 --> 15:43.203
[Nedley groaning]

15:43.943 --> 15:45.205
Yeah, uh...

15:46.815 --> 15:47.990
I guess that fight at the stairs
took a little more out of me

15:48.034 --> 15:49.339
than I thought.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.080
And I've been skipping my Zumba.

15:52.777 --> 15:54.431
Deep breaths.
Just take a minute.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.172
I'm gonna need a little
more than a minute, kid.

15:56.216 --> 15:57.173
But you gotta go.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.262
I'm not leaving you like this.

16:01.525 --> 16:02.962
-Oh!
-Look...

16:03.963 --> 16:07.314
I have survived a career
in law enforcement,

16:07.357 --> 16:08.793
divorcing a Taurus,

16:08.837 --> 16:10.839
and a community theatre
production of The Full Monty

16:10.882 --> 16:12.623
that the Purgatory
Press called...

16:13.233 --> 16:14.799
"Nobody asked for this".

16:16.062 --> 16:17.237
I'm gonna be fine.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.326
I am happy to stay with him.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.110
I was a slutty nurse
once for Halloween.

16:22.851 --> 16:23.895
I'm going alone?

16:24.853 --> 16:25.810
You listen to me.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.639
Wynonna Earp.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.555
Nobody fucks with our family.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.645
[tense music]

16:35.603 --> 16:36.908
So go get 'em.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.569
Take care of each other.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.485
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:49.008 --> 16:50.879
It's okay, Randy.

16:50.922 --> 16:53.664
Okay, let's go raid the clinic.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.058
I will get some oxy,
a little morphine

16:56.102 --> 16:58.147
and maybe a little
something for you.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.019
-Okay!
-Oh, God.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.021
[intense music]

17:15.382 --> 17:16.600
If this is Eden,

17:17.601 --> 17:19.473
it ain't the way
they wrote it up.

17:24.347 --> 17:25.479
[door slamming]

17:33.617 --> 17:35.402
Where are you, Waverly Earp?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.536
Where am I?

17:41.930 --> 17:43.845
Doc! Doc, I'm here!

17:44.889 --> 17:45.803
Waverly?!

17:50.330 --> 17:51.766
Doc!

17:52.767 --> 17:54.334
[Waverly screaming]

17:54.377 --> 17:55.378
Waverly!

17:55.422 --> 17:58.120
[intense music]

17:58.164 --> 18:00.992
[gasping]
Quick! It's getting tighter!

18:01.036 --> 18:02.733
Quick! Doc, quick!

18:03.560 --> 18:04.431
[screaming]

18:05.258 --> 18:06.346
Argh!

18:06.389 --> 18:07.260
Doc!

18:08.391 --> 18:09.349
Please!

18:17.922 --> 18:19.881
Of course it would be a well.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.752
But I am a weapon.

18:21.796 --> 18:22.884
Argh!

18:22.927 --> 18:23.972
[gasping]

18:25.321 --> 18:27.845
[hissing]

18:33.416 --> 18:34.852
[panting]

18:48.214 --> 18:49.476
You're alright now.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.043
Doc.

18:53.393 --> 18:54.611
You came.

18:54.655 --> 18:55.743
Of course.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.137
Thank you...

18:58.963 --> 19:00.269
Thank you for sucking...

19:01.705 --> 19:03.272
I do try, Waverly.

19:03.316 --> 19:05.405
Bulshar's poison out
of Wynonna's throat.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.712
May he rest
in eternal torment.

19:10.627 --> 19:13.369
[sinister music]

19:14.501 --> 19:16.372
[hissing]

19:22.204 --> 19:23.553
Are you kidding me?!

19:29.994 --> 19:31.039
It was the gun.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.739
Without the gun,
without them...

19:37.350 --> 19:38.394
I'm nothing.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.180
Whoa, now.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.704
You ain't nothing.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.402
You ain't much.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.753
But you ain't nothing.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.238
Shut up, you sexy peach cobbler.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.327
I don't deserve cheering up.

19:58.371 --> 20:01.112
Oh! Oh, you want cheering up?

20:01.156 --> 20:04.246
I might have already been
eaten by a giant dandelion!

20:06.466 --> 20:08.337
I'm so sorry, baby girl.

20:11.732 --> 20:12.602
And Haught.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.648
[scoffs]

20:14.691 --> 20:16.345
She must hate me most of all.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.654
[Nicole]: Wynonna Earp!

20:22.395 --> 20:24.571
Pretty sure that wasn't me.
[gasps]

20:25.267 --> 20:27.182
Nicole Haught,

20:27.226 --> 20:29.837
you glorious ginger bitch.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.055
Gimme a big one!

20:31.491 --> 20:32.796
-Argh!
-Oh!

20:32.840 --> 20:34.189
[Doc]: I believe
it was this one

20:34.233 --> 20:35.930
that lead us back to
the woods of Purgatory.

20:35.973 --> 20:37.453
[Waverly]: What?
You don't remember?

20:38.324 --> 20:40.282
I do. I did.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.066
Shit.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.242
But it's not the same...

20:43.894 --> 20:45.374
...since when I was last here.

20:46.201 --> 20:47.376
Where do they all go?

20:47.420 --> 20:48.769
[slamming on door]

20:52.076 --> 20:54.383
Out would be nice.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.779
[suspenseful music]

21:08.267 --> 21:10.486
I know you never ended up
watching Friends,

21:10.530 --> 21:13.837
but could this be any more
Chernobyl right now?

21:13.881 --> 21:16.013
[intense music]

21:20.191 --> 21:21.628
I'll forget about this,

21:21.671 --> 21:23.151
and you can just forget
about the time I slipped you

21:23.194 --> 21:24.239
some Sleeping Beauties.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.458
Wynonna!

21:25.501 --> 21:27.111
Listen, it's ancient history!

21:27.155 --> 21:29.636
It was yesterday!

21:31.377 --> 21:33.509
-Oh, right.
-What if I could have helped?

21:33.553 --> 21:34.771
Well, we'll never know,

21:34.815 --> 21:36.295
because you left me
passed out on the floor!

21:36.338 --> 21:37.426
You couldn't
have done anything.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.689
I just jumped off
a friggin' train!

21:39.733 --> 21:41.474
They only got in
'cause they're special,

21:41.517 --> 21:42.997
so unless you're like a...

21:43.040 --> 21:45.478
a bisexual angel,
or an undead gunslinger--

21:45.521 --> 21:47.262
Oh, no. No, you don't
get to be the judge

21:47.306 --> 21:48.524
of who matters and who doesn't.

21:49.525 --> 21:50.309
True.

21:51.266 --> 21:52.572
I am just a girl,

21:53.616 --> 21:55.139
standing in front of a cop,

21:55.183 --> 21:57.794
asking her to forgive me
for slipping her

21:57.838 --> 21:59.579
a tiny little bit
of roof-beer.

22:01.276 --> 22:02.103
Unbelievable.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.846
Nicole, I need you
to come with me.

22:05.889 --> 22:08.370
I don't even get
where you're going.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.198
To find someone named Valdez,

22:10.241 --> 22:12.592
at a BBD hotspot near Monument.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.681
Okay, and how does that
help us find Waverly,

22:14.724 --> 22:16.509
who disappeared up some
stairs back that way?

22:16.552 --> 22:19.381
Because we think it leads
to another way into the garden.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.643
Another door.

22:22.558 --> 22:23.646
Another door.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.779
Yeah. A back door,
if you will.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.305
Okay. Two...

22:31.524 --> 22:32.960
...powerful women

22:33.003 --> 22:35.397
at death's door!

22:35.441 --> 22:36.398
That's us!

22:38.008 --> 22:40.141
See? A pile of random novelty
cards would never lie to us.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.403
-Okay.
-Ahh!

22:42.491 --> 22:43.536
One condition:

22:44.841 --> 22:46.843
No pranks. No lies.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.062
No going rogue.

22:48.541 --> 22:49.977
Total honesty.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.110
That's like three and
a half conditions.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.462
Take it or leave it.
And I'm driving.

22:58.289 --> 22:59.378
Fine, Dad.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.250
But yeah, you really
are the Daddy.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.383
Okay, shut the box
and your trap.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.428
At least you've got your magic
gun you can contribute.

23:08.082 --> 23:11.041
Yeah. You, me...

23:11.085 --> 23:13.000
and Peacemaker.

23:14.262 --> 23:15.176
So...

23:16.395 --> 23:18.309
Road Trip! You wanna be
Thelma or Louise?

23:19.572 --> 23:21.617
[ominous music]

23:25.969 --> 23:27.449
Tacos are tasty.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.885
What's that now?

23:28.929 --> 23:30.060
My dad's throne.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.368
The angel who became stone
to protect the garden.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.588
To protect it from what?
Bulshar is no more.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.067
There's something else.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.591
Yeah, there always is.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.945
No, ma'am. Your keester
shall not be sitting upon

23:44.988 --> 23:46.294
this stone-turning chair.

23:46.337 --> 23:48.905
It is my birthright.
My legacy.

23:50.777 --> 23:53.344
I don't know why
I said that, but...

23:53.388 --> 23:54.737
maybe let's skedaddle.

23:54.781 --> 23:57.479
[vehicle approaching]

23:58.654 --> 23:59.873
We are not alone.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.833
[intense music]

24:17.543 --> 24:20.546
[rhythmic drumming]

24:28.075 --> 24:31.557
I didn't get a warning, so,
uh, no chance to clean up.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.603
But thrilled you're here.

24:35.343 --> 24:36.953
[inhales]
And you're both healthy,

24:36.997 --> 24:37.998
that's great.

24:38.564 --> 24:39.478
Great for what?

24:39.521 --> 24:42.132
For you. For it.

24:42.698 --> 24:43.873
For the whole human race.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.135
[nervous giggling]

24:45.179 --> 24:47.398
Holy milkshakes,
are you Black Badge?

24:47.442 --> 24:48.269
Was I?

24:49.575 --> 24:50.271
Are you?

24:51.620 --> 24:52.447
Well...

24:53.230 --> 24:54.493
There's no time for orientation,

24:54.536 --> 24:55.798
but that's just how it goes.

24:55.842 --> 24:58.932
So the best way to learn
is to just dive right in.

24:58.975 --> 24:59.976
I had to.

25:00.455 --> 25:01.543
What is this place?

25:02.022 --> 25:02.849
First rule...

25:04.503 --> 25:05.591
Keep her fed.

25:06.069 --> 25:08.071
Blood has to be fresh.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.247
-Human.
-[Waverly gasps]

25:11.031 --> 25:12.511
Oh, here.

25:18.908 --> 25:22.042
Whatever this is,
it is not our task.

25:22.085 --> 25:24.566
Please. We need to go home.

25:25.045 --> 25:26.525
Tell us how we can leave!

25:27.090 --> 25:28.004
[nervous giggling]

25:31.399 --> 25:32.313
I'm afraid...

25:33.575 --> 25:35.751
...there's only one way
out of this prison.

25:35.795 --> 25:36.970
No, weird guy, no!

25:38.406 --> 25:39.276
[thudding]

25:42.062 --> 25:43.716
Are you out of your mind?

25:43.759 --> 25:45.239
What other option do we have?

25:45.282 --> 25:47.067
This gentleman
just self-decapitated!

25:47.110 --> 25:48.242
I'm gonna barf!

25:48.285 --> 25:49.765
Not until we try.

25:49.809 --> 25:52.028
You used your angel gumption
to revive Julian!

25:52.072 --> 25:53.595
Doc, he has no head!

25:54.422 --> 25:56.076
Well, the head is right there!

25:56.903 --> 25:57.425
Look...

25:58.426 --> 25:59.645
We need to speak
to this man more.

25:59.688 --> 26:00.820
We need answers!

26:00.863 --> 26:02.299
Okay, okay.

26:02.909 --> 26:03.779
Trying.

26:05.476 --> 26:06.042
Uh...

26:07.174 --> 26:09.219
Whoever you are... live!

26:09.263 --> 26:12.440
[screams]
Not working! Not working!

26:12.483 --> 26:13.615
Shit!

26:13.659 --> 26:15.791
[metal creaking loudly]

26:21.667 --> 26:23.277
Whatever this place is,

26:26.149 --> 26:27.411
it is angry.

26:27.455 --> 26:30.414
Doc, he has hundreds
of those scars.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.811
[loud droning]

26:38.509 --> 26:40.424
What? Okay...

26:41.687 --> 26:42.905
He said...

26:44.646 --> 26:45.908
...it needs blood.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.520
But human blood!

26:49.564 --> 26:52.088
Not half-angel or vampire-blood!

26:52.872 --> 26:53.960
Shit!

26:54.961 --> 26:56.484
When life gives you lemons...

26:57.703 --> 26:59.008
...you get a-squeezing.

27:08.844 --> 27:09.802
[tires screech]

27:11.281 --> 27:13.370
This place looks like
Fyre Festival two.

27:13.414 --> 27:16.678
-What happened?
-Typical BBD clusterschmutz.

27:17.331 --> 27:19.507
Take on the supernatural,
get your ass handed to you,

27:19.550 --> 27:22.771
then call in a mini Maldito
to blow up the evidence.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.947
So where do we think
this Valdez is at?

27:25.948 --> 27:27.297
Oh, she dead.

27:27.341 --> 27:30.083
What?! Dude! You promised
you'd be honest!

27:30.605 --> 27:32.955
Only after I had
already said that.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.348
I didn't promise to go back

27:34.391 --> 27:35.958
and correct other
bullshit I'd delivered.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.220
Alright, come on,
Haught, punch it!

27:37.960 --> 27:40.354
[quietly]: Your face,
again? Don't tempt me.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.400
[tires screeching]

27:44.445 --> 27:45.881
Come on!

27:45.925 --> 27:48.101
I just ate a whole bag
of buffalo blue cheese combos!

27:48.144 --> 27:50.930
[liquid pouring,
Waverly grunting]

27:52.366 --> 27:54.281
Nice to see you boys
getting along.

27:54.324 --> 27:55.674
Well, without a head,

27:55.717 --> 27:57.458
technically it's a 61.

27:58.415 --> 28:00.461
Best use him up
while he's still fresh.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.725
Would hate for all this
perfectly good food

28:03.769 --> 28:04.813
to go to waste.

28:04.857 --> 28:07.468
Food? Doc, you're doing great,

28:07.511 --> 28:09.862
but maybe I should just,
you know, take this.

28:11.646 --> 28:13.735
[breathing heavily]

28:13.779 --> 28:14.954
Bought us more time.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.565
Not sure how much,
but well,

28:17.608 --> 28:19.436
at least we can give
this poor fella a break.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.047
[growling]

28:21.090 --> 28:21.830
Doc?

28:22.875 --> 28:24.398
Fang-nabbit.

28:25.225 --> 28:27.880
[tense music]

28:29.925 --> 28:32.101
Bet this was a fun
place to work.

28:32.145 --> 28:34.713
BBD isn't exactly known
for their feng shui.

28:36.976 --> 28:37.890
Hang on, hang on.

28:39.065 --> 28:40.631
Let me have a sip
of thinking juice, here.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.679
Is that Julian's ring?
How did you...?

28:44.723 --> 28:47.203
[gasps]
At home. Where you left it.

28:48.204 --> 28:49.553
So, Ms. No-more-secrets,

28:49.597 --> 28:51.773
what aren't you telling me, hmm?

28:52.687 --> 28:54.123
Waverly proposed to me.

28:54.994 --> 28:55.734
And?

28:57.213 --> 28:59.999
And I believe the Romans
called it Wynonnus Interruptus.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.088
It is more effective
than the pill,

29:02.131 --> 29:03.350
and a lot cheaper.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.744
That's not how
lesbian-ing works, Wynonna.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.180
So? Is it a yes?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.183
Like I'm gonna tell you first.

29:12.098 --> 29:13.577
[gunshot]

29:13.621 --> 29:16.015
[intense music]

29:16.058 --> 29:17.712
Sniper fire. Whoa, hey!

29:18.147 --> 29:20.323
Save your bullets. We don't know
where the shots are coming from.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.499
-Uh, excuse me.
-Yeah?

29:22.543 --> 29:23.718
That's not Peacemaker.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.504
It's a... It's a funny story.

29:27.548 --> 29:30.203
So you also lied to me
about not lying?!

29:30.246 --> 29:32.074
Can we just focus
on the bastard

29:32.118 --> 29:33.510
who's just murdered my whiskey?

29:34.294 --> 29:35.686
Okay, sure.

29:35.730 --> 29:36.862
Holster Doc's gun.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.342
You're going to help
Daddy find him.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.692
Ooh, that actually
felt really good.

29:47.481 --> 29:48.395
Are you okay?

29:51.311 --> 29:53.008
I have composed myself.

29:55.271 --> 29:58.622
I was certain
North was that way,

29:59.058 --> 30:01.321
but then the sun
was coming from that way,

30:01.887 --> 30:03.323
so it cannot be.

30:06.717 --> 30:07.806
You built a fire.

30:09.285 --> 30:12.027
Did I? Or was it already here?

30:13.899 --> 30:15.639
How long have we been here?

30:16.684 --> 30:17.990
We must find a way out.

30:18.599 --> 30:19.469
Soon.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.777
What we need now is rest.

30:24.344 --> 30:25.258
If it's alright,

30:26.476 --> 30:28.609
I feel like talking
a little longer.

30:30.393 --> 30:32.831
I need to atone
for my recent history.

30:34.484 --> 30:36.399
We've all done bad things
to one another.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.359
You never seem to.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.492
You're being forgetful.

30:44.059 --> 30:45.017
Or kind.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.630
What is important
is that you came,

30:51.066 --> 30:52.981
and that we're both
gonna get back to them.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.245
Yes. You are right.

30:56.811 --> 31:00.119
Neither Earp nor Haught will
leave any stone unturned.

31:01.511 --> 31:03.122
It is Nicole, right?

31:04.166 --> 31:05.124
And Wynonna?

31:08.910 --> 31:10.303
Wynonna Earp.

31:14.655 --> 31:15.482
Yeah.

31:16.570 --> 31:17.876
Yeah, it's Nicole.

31:19.399 --> 31:21.227
She's the sheriff with...

31:22.097 --> 31:24.839
...red hair, brown eyes.

31:25.579 --> 31:26.623
Stetson.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.191
Nicole Haught.

31:29.235 --> 31:32.368
Nicole Haught, the red hair,
the brown eyes...

31:33.804 --> 31:36.807
I can't believe you didn't
tell me about Peacemaker.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.635
Would you be here if I did?

31:38.679 --> 31:40.637
Now shut it, I have to focus.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.552
[exhaling]

31:42.596 --> 31:45.294
Float like a butterface,
swing like a three... some.

31:46.861 --> 31:48.907
Clear eyes, full bra,
can't lose.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.125
Just zig-zag.

31:51.083 --> 31:51.822
You'll be fine.

31:53.259 --> 31:56.218
[gunshots]

31:56.958 --> 31:57.872
Come at me bro!

31:58.351 --> 32:00.092
[tense music]

32:00.135 --> 32:01.484
[gunshot]

32:01.528 --> 32:04.226
Is that the best you got?
Come on, bring it, man!

32:05.053 --> 32:06.881
I got you right
where I want you.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.230
[gunshot]

32:10.319 --> 32:11.799
-[gunshot]
-Ahh! Okay, that was close.

32:11.842 --> 32:13.192
Haught! Any time!

32:14.106 --> 32:16.499
-[gunshot]
-Zig-zagging does nothing!

32:16.543 --> 32:17.718
[gunfire]

32:17.761 --> 32:19.111
Hurry up, hurry up!

32:20.155 --> 32:21.156
Behind you.

32:24.638 --> 32:25.769
They always look.

32:26.596 --> 32:27.902
You took your sweet time.

32:28.424 --> 32:29.817
You're still alive.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.950
Well, the next time someone
has to risk their lives,

32:31.993 --> 32:33.952
-you're it!
-Yeah, fine, no problem!

32:33.995 --> 32:35.736
I mean, as long as I haven't
been roofied again

32:35.779 --> 32:36.911
by my best friend!

32:38.652 --> 32:39.740
I've never had a best friend.

32:41.481 --> 32:42.917
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:44.701 --> 32:46.225
God, you are such an...

32:46.703 --> 32:47.835
Earp.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.148
Oh...

32:57.062 --> 32:58.977
Congratulations, Haught.

32:59.020 --> 33:01.457
You cold cocked a cast
member of Little Women.

33:06.288 --> 33:07.463
Valdez.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.338
Wait 'til Waves hears
you took out a toddler.

33:12.381 --> 33:13.992
Who was trying to shoot you.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.168
And you call yourself
a feminist.

33:16.211 --> 33:18.344
Hey, um, any thoughts
on what to do about this?

33:18.387 --> 33:21.869
This girl obviously knows
Dr. Gloria Valdez.

33:21.912 --> 33:23.523
And you said she was killed
in act--

33:23.566 --> 33:24.480
Shh.

33:28.702 --> 33:29.833
This is child abuse.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.357
Not if you're over sixteen.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.664
Hope you feel super dupes
about getting the drop on me.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.710
-You shot at us.
-You were trespassing.

33:36.753 --> 33:38.320
Well, we didn't know
anyone lived here.

33:38.364 --> 33:40.496
Oh! Well, now you do!
You're welcome.

33:40.540 --> 33:41.976
Alright.
[claps]

33:42.020 --> 33:43.804
We need your help getting
into a secret government lab

33:43.847 --> 33:46.024
that's somewhere in your warm
and welcoming home.

33:46.546 --> 33:47.634
You want intel?

33:48.548 --> 33:49.462
It's gonna cost you.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.641
[scoffs]
Cash?

33:54.684 --> 33:55.729
What am I supposed
to do with that?

33:56.382 --> 33:58.645
Look around,
Ketchup and Mustard.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.429
My grocery store is a dumpster.

34:04.651 --> 34:05.913
Ah?

34:05.956 --> 34:07.219
Is that made with ethically
sourced palm oil?

34:07.262 --> 34:09.308
Oh, just eat it.
You're clearly starving.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.483
I still have a code.

34:11.919 --> 34:14.791
Well, the code better be
to Dr. Gloria Valdez's lab.

34:14.835 --> 34:15.749
Never heard of her.

34:17.142 --> 34:18.230
That's mine.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.058
Then, talk.

34:21.798 --> 34:22.625
Hey.

34:23.191 --> 34:24.801
Killie Bobby Brown.

34:24.845 --> 34:28.501
We think Dr. Gloria Valdez
can help us save my family.

34:29.502 --> 34:30.720
I really doubt that,

34:30.764 --> 34:32.200
since she took off on her own.

34:34.724 --> 34:35.986
Gloria Valdez is your mother.

34:38.032 --> 34:38.902
I'm sorry.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.122
Why? You don't know me.

34:41.644 --> 34:43.603
I know what it's like to have
parents flake out on you.

34:43.646 --> 34:46.127
But you said you're here
to help protect your family.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.433
Not my parents. My sister.

34:48.303 --> 34:50.610
I would do literally anything...

34:51.219 --> 34:52.307
to keep her safe.

34:53.613 --> 34:56.572
So listen, help us find
Dr. Gloria Valdez...

34:56.616 --> 34:57.660
Wynonna...

34:58.313 --> 35:00.620
Okay. I know where the lab is.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.665
-I can get you in.
-Clever girl.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.319
Actually, it's Rachel.

35:04.363 --> 35:05.494
Okie dokie.

35:06.495 --> 35:08.280
Okay, but high key,

35:08.323 --> 35:10.891
follow me closely and
keep your mouths shut.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.022
Okay.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.589
This would've been
so much easier

35:13.633 --> 35:15.722
if Dolls' files had, like,
a map of the building.

35:15.765 --> 35:17.289
Yeah, it's called a blueprint.

35:17.332 --> 35:20.422
Wait... Xavier Dolls?

35:20.466 --> 35:21.206
You know him?

35:27.168 --> 35:29.779
[ominous music]

35:40.790 --> 35:43.967
[sinister whispering]

35:50.496 --> 35:52.019
Oh poop.

35:52.062 --> 35:53.194
He's jerky.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.718
And I've never been
more vegan.

36:01.811 --> 36:03.596
Okay, here goes.

36:04.771 --> 36:06.773
[pained groaning]

36:12.561 --> 36:13.910
It's friggin' angel blood!

36:13.954 --> 36:16.261
Come on you stupid machine,
it's the pure stuff!

36:17.436 --> 36:19.960
[low droning]

36:23.050 --> 36:25.574
[angelic female vocals]

36:27.707 --> 36:29.317
[female whispering]: Waverly.

36:29.796 --> 36:30.753
Hello?

36:36.324 --> 36:38.587
[suspenseful music]

36:43.505 --> 36:45.072
There was a big accident
at the lab,

36:45.115 --> 36:47.335
and Black Badge gassed
the whole thing for containment.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.859
Dolls was the one
that made me leave.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.252
Even without my mom.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.603
Probably the right call, I mean,
he pretty much saved me.

36:54.647 --> 36:55.604
Me too.

36:55.648 --> 36:56.605
Me three.

36:56.649 --> 36:58.433
He was an incredible soldier.

36:58.477 --> 36:59.391
Was?

37:00.783 --> 37:03.308
Man, sometimes life is a real
backpack of balls.

37:04.091 --> 37:05.135
Can we keep her, Daddy?

37:06.398 --> 37:08.182
Rachel, what kind of gas?

37:08.226 --> 37:09.836
All Dolls said
was that it was dangerous

37:10.315 --> 37:12.012
and it didn't do what BBD
thought it would.

37:15.407 --> 37:17.235
[Rachel whispering]: No more
talking from now on,

37:17.278 --> 37:18.540
and stay close.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.934
Whatever you do,
do not step on the grates.

37:21.369 --> 37:22.588
Why? What happens
if you step on--

37:22.631 --> 37:25.808
I am so serious.
Shut your mouth.

37:25.852 --> 37:27.157
Hey, yo, we get it.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.292
Why do we have to be quiet
if everyone's dead?

37:33.381 --> 37:35.992
[water sloshing]

37:38.038 --> 37:40.258
[walls creaking]

37:49.832 --> 37:52.574
[ominous music]

38:18.383 --> 38:20.298
Whatever my mom
was working on,

38:20.341 --> 38:22.343
the lab, it's through there.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.040
[Nicole]: You haven't
been inside?

38:24.084 --> 38:26.608
Never. The big glass
door's locked.

38:26.652 --> 38:28.480
How locked
can a glass door be?

38:29.437 --> 38:32.135
Wow, these guys did not find
a great work-life balance.

38:32.179 --> 38:34.312
BBD gassed
their own employees.

38:34.877 --> 38:35.748
But...

38:36.357 --> 38:37.663
not all of them, right?

38:37.706 --> 38:39.317
I mean, as far as
I can tell from here,

38:39.360 --> 38:40.927
my mom's not one
of those bodies.

38:41.710 --> 38:42.842
You came back for her.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.108
Rachel, that's really brave.

38:48.151 --> 38:49.501
So like, now what?

38:49.544 --> 38:51.894
How do we get to the lab?
It's in the basement.

38:51.938 --> 38:52.678
Basement?

38:53.243 --> 38:54.897
Well, I guess some ropes,

38:54.941 --> 38:57.987
some makeshift pulleys, I can
belay Wynonna down first.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.383
Hey, does that guy
look weird to you?

39:03.950 --> 39:05.081
Beaver blaster in the house!

39:05.125 --> 39:06.605
-Wynonna, what are you--
-Duck!

39:06.648 --> 39:08.258
-Duck?
-Duck!

39:09.434 --> 39:11.087
No! They'll wake up!

39:12.524 --> 39:14.090
[explosion]

39:15.048 --> 39:15.875
Bacon what?

39:15.918 --> 39:18.094
[growling]

39:18.138 --> 39:20.096
[ominous music]

39:21.141 --> 39:24.710
Game on, bitches!
Let's go find a hellmou...

39:25.319 --> 39:26.364
[snarling]

39:26.407 --> 39:28.409
That's why I told you
to shut up.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.063
Shut up and run!

39:32.108 --> 39:33.283
[gunshots]

39:39.072 --> 39:40.247
Why didn't you tell us

39:40.290 --> 39:41.770
there was mutant
zombie scientists!

39:41.814 --> 39:43.859
[Wynonna gasps]
Beaver-blasted mutant

39:43.903 --> 39:45.513
zombie scientists! Get in here!

39:47.254 --> 39:48.777
I thought you'd bail.

39:48.821 --> 39:49.822
I'm not stupid.

39:50.475 --> 39:52.215
Maybe my mom's okay,
maybe she's not.

39:52.259 --> 39:54.043
But I need to know.

39:54.087 --> 39:55.871
And I can't get
to her by myself.

39:55.915 --> 39:57.438
-[zombies growling]
-Go!

40:03.531 --> 40:05.751
[upbeat house music]

40:12.192 --> 40:13.454
[gunshot]

40:17.937 --> 40:19.678
[thudding, glass shattering]

40:20.940 --> 40:22.202
[gunshots]

40:26.336 --> 40:27.468
[grunting]

40:27.512 --> 40:29.209
[Wynonna]: Nicole!
Where are you?!

40:30.428 --> 40:32.212
Argh!

40:32.255 --> 40:33.735
[zombies growling]

40:34.432 --> 40:35.345
Wynonna?

40:39.045 --> 40:40.612
[growling]

40:41.308 --> 40:43.353
[struggled grunts]

40:48.054 --> 40:50.186
[breathing heavily]

40:50.883 --> 40:51.840
Nicole!

40:52.711 --> 40:53.712
Rachel!

40:53.755 --> 40:55.583
Ladies? Hello?!

40:56.628 --> 40:58.238
-Guys?!
-[growling]

40:59.369 --> 41:00.675
Ya! Ya!

41:00.719 --> 41:02.503
Ahh! Bad guy!

41:02.547 --> 41:03.678
Ahh!

41:03.722 --> 41:05.114
Wynonna Scissor Hands!

41:09.771 --> 41:10.903
Nicole?!

41:10.946 --> 41:12.382
I'm coming, where are you?!

41:12.426 --> 41:13.819
[growling]

41:15.473 --> 41:16.735
Nicole?!

41:16.778 --> 41:18.780
[gates rattling]

41:18.824 --> 41:19.868
Rachel!

41:21.000 --> 41:22.567
[growling]

41:28.573 --> 41:30.009
Wynonna!

41:30.705 --> 41:32.446
-Oh shit.
-You stepped on a grate.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.231
Why did I eat all those
goddamn combos?

41:35.275 --> 41:37.103
Nicole, find the portal.

41:38.365 --> 41:39.061
Save Waverly.

41:39.540 --> 41:40.410
Fuck that.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.457
-Like you said, I'm it.
-No!

41:47.592 --> 41:49.507
If you die, I'll kill you!

41:52.640 --> 41:53.728
Nicole!

41:55.251 --> 41:57.645
[breathing heavily]

42:00.953 --> 42:03.216
[soft music]

42:06.219 --> 42:08.613
[wind blowing]

42:11.529 --> 42:13.531
Waverly, you dang fool.

42:15.402 --> 42:16.795
What has she done?

42:18.187 --> 42:19.232
[Waverly]: Hello?

42:21.060 --> 42:22.452
Anybody? Hello?!

42:29.721 --> 42:31.113
Hi.
[chuckling]

42:32.811 --> 42:33.899
Well, Sheriff Haught.

42:35.944 --> 42:37.380
At least you are
wearing a smile.
