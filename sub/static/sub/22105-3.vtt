<i>My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:02.335 --> 00:03.905
<i>And I graduated from one of</i>

00:04.035 --> 00:05.403
<i>Canada's top business schools</i>

00:05.454 --> 00:07.739
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:07.790 --> 00:09.457
<i>Now I'm using my knowledge</i>

00:09.491 --> 00:11.492
<i>to help struggling
small business owners</i>

00:11.544 --> 00:13.461
<i>make it in this
competitive world.</i>

00:21.971 --> 00:24.889
This is <i> Nathan For You.</i>

00:26.258 --> 00:29.227
<i>Aw. When something this cuddly
is your product,</i>

00:29.261 --> 00:31.346
<i>you'd think it would
sell itself.</i>

00:31.348 --> 00:35.183
<i>But Jennifer Berardini at Pet
Mania in Burbank, California,</i>

00:35.185 --> 00:37.235
<i>knows that it takes more than
just a cute little face</i>

00:37.269 --> 00:38.519
<i>to bring in customers.</i>

00:38.521 --> 00:39.938
We advertise online,

00:39.989 --> 00:41.189
a little bit of print mail,

00:41.240 --> 00:42.907
sign advertising, flyers.

00:42.942 --> 00:46.194
In <i> The Burbank Times</i>
they run our ad continuously.

00:46.196 --> 00:48.196
<i>But effective advertising
isn't about quantity.</i>

00:48.198 --> 00:49.864
<i>It's about location.</i>

00:49.866 --> 00:51.199
<i>So I came to Jennifer</i>

00:51.250 --> 00:54.335
<i>with a targeted way
to reach potential customers.</i>

00:54.370 --> 00:56.311
When someone has a pet,
and the pet dies,

00:56.362 --> 00:58.362
they want to--
get a new one.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.637
Absolutely.

01:00.739 --> 01:01.764
Jolly!

01:02.079 --> 01:04.641
So, I think the best place
for you to advertise

01:04.671 --> 01:06.580
would be...
at a pet cemetary.

01:06.613 --> 01:08.808
Could be.

01:09.070 --> 01:11.143
The problem is
most pet cemetaries

01:11.182 --> 01:12.766
don't allow advertisements.

01:12.817 --> 01:14.434
- Right.
- But there's no law

01:14.436 --> 01:17.404
about what you're allowed
to put on a gravestone.

01:17.438 --> 01:19.273
Pardon?

01:19.324 --> 01:22.442
<i>By putting an ad for Pet Mania
on a dead pet's tombstone,</i>

01:22.444 --> 01:25.445
<i>Jennifer would have a permanent
billboard in a pet cemetery</i>

01:25.496 --> 01:27.197
<i>that would be seen
by all the people</i>

01:27.248 --> 01:28.782
<i>that just lost their pets.</i>

01:28.784 --> 01:32.753
<i>The Plan: Market to mourners
by advertising on a gravestone.</i>

01:32.787 --> 01:34.454
I'm not sure.

01:34.456 --> 01:36.006
Some people are gonna
take it one way,

01:36.040 --> 01:38.125
and some people are gonna
take it another way.

01:38.127 --> 01:39.509
And they're gonna be offended.

01:39.544 --> 01:42.129
Obviously, I would do this
very tastefully

01:42.131 --> 01:44.931
while, at the same time,
meet the advertising goals

01:44.966 --> 01:46.933
of the pet store.

01:46.968 --> 01:48.385
Okay.

01:48.436 --> 01:50.771
<i>In order to get a tombstone
in a pet cemetery,</i>

01:50.805 --> 01:52.723
<i>I'd have to bury a real pet.</i>

01:52.774 --> 01:55.142
<i>So the other night,
I caught a fly in my kitchen</i>

01:55.144 --> 01:56.560
<i>and named it Buzz.</i>

01:56.611 --> 01:59.112
<i>Even though Buzz would be easy
to just swat dead,</i>

01:59.147 --> 02:00.981
<i>something about that felt wrong.</i>

02:01.032 --> 02:03.150
<i>So I was going to do my best
to care for him</i>

02:03.152 --> 02:05.736
<i>and let him die of
natural causes.</i>

02:05.787 --> 02:08.872
<i>In the meantime, I began to make
arrangements for his funeral.</i>

02:08.906 --> 02:11.708
<i>So I contacted one of the area's
biggest pet cemeteries</i>

02:11.743 --> 02:13.577
<i>to book a date
and a grave plot.</i>

02:13.628 --> 02:15.912
This is your pet.

02:15.963 --> 02:17.631
It's unconditional love.

02:17.665 --> 02:19.750
We'll treat you the same
with the burial.

02:19.801 --> 02:21.001
So just to be clear,

02:21.003 --> 02:23.136
I can put whatever I want
on my gravestone.

02:23.171 --> 02:24.721
It's completely up to you.

02:24.756 --> 02:26.506
Granted, I've never seen a fly
come in here before,

02:26.557 --> 02:28.425
But I'm open to it.

02:28.476 --> 02:31.094
- There's not a problem with it.
- <i>With the arrangements made,</i>

02:31.145 --> 02:34.014
<i>I went to an engraver to lay out
the text for Buzz's headstone</i>

02:34.065 --> 02:36.233
<i>that would double
as the pet store ad.</i>

02:36.267 --> 02:39.353
<i>Now it was just a matter of
waiting until Buzz died.</i>

02:39.355 --> 02:40.687
<i>Over the next week,</i>

02:40.689 --> 02:43.523
<i>I tried to make his remaining
days somewhat enjoyable.</i>

02:43.574 --> 02:45.909
<i>I gave him some rotting food
and even a ladybug</i>

02:45.943 --> 02:48.528
<i>in case he wanted something
to have sex with.</i>

02:48.530 --> 02:51.081
<i>He quickly became a favorite
around the office, too.</i>

02:51.115 --> 02:52.282
<i>Hello, Buzz.</i>

02:52.333 --> 02:53.867
<i>Sometimes he would even
stay on my finger</i>

02:53.918 --> 02:55.919
<i>without flying away.</i>

02:55.953 --> 02:57.871
<i>I wonder why he did that.</i>

02:59.407 --> 03:02.876
<i>Then one day, when I came into
work, Buzz wasn't moving.</i>

03:02.878 --> 03:04.378
<i>I assumed he was dead,</i>

03:04.429 --> 03:06.630
<i>but I took him to a vet
just to be sure.</i>

03:06.681 --> 03:09.049
So this fly has passed away.

03:09.051 --> 03:11.635
<i>With Buzz officially
declared dead,</i>

03:11.686 --> 03:14.638
<i>I was finally able to move
forward with my plan.</i>

03:14.689 --> 03:16.606
<i>So we headed down
to the pet cemetery</i>

03:16.641 --> 03:19.025
<i>for Buzz's final send-off.</i>

03:19.060 --> 03:21.561
<i>To avoid any pushback
when I unveiled the gravestone,</i>

03:21.563 --> 03:25.565
<i>I wanted the service to look
as legitimate as possible.</i>

03:25.616 --> 03:28.118
<i>And since I'm Jewish, I hired
a rabbi to conduct the service</i>

03:28.152 --> 03:29.953
<i>and had a few words with him
before.</i>

03:29.987 --> 03:34.408
Tell me a little bit about
what--who we are honoring.

03:34.459 --> 03:35.625
Buzz.

03:35.660 --> 03:38.745
- Buzz?
- Who is my pet fly.

03:40.465 --> 03:41.832
I'm sorry.

03:41.883 --> 03:43.550
- You laughed.
- Yeah.

03:43.584 --> 03:45.919
Don't you think
that's a little insensitive?

03:45.970 --> 03:48.088
Um...

03:48.090 --> 03:52.426
What is important is
the connection that you have.

03:52.428 --> 03:54.094
<i>After consulting with
the rabbi,</i>

03:54.145 --> 03:56.062
<i>I greeted my only guest,
Salomon,</i>

03:56.097 --> 03:57.431
<i>who works in our
production office</i>

03:57.482 --> 03:59.933
<i>and seemed to take
a liking to Buzz.</i>

03:59.984 --> 04:02.018
Have you ever been to
a Jewish funeral before?

04:02.069 --> 04:03.603
- No.
- Oh.

04:03.654 --> 04:05.522
What do you know about judaism?

04:05.573 --> 04:09.526
Well, I know that
they always...

04:09.577 --> 04:12.662
they put on this little hat.

04:12.697 --> 04:14.114
And what else?

04:14.116 --> 04:15.999
That's all I know.

04:16.033 --> 04:19.702
Well, you're gonna learn a lot
more about judaism today.

04:19.754 --> 04:21.120
Yeah.

04:21.172 --> 04:23.423
<i>Even though I was doing
all this to help a pet store,</i>

04:23.458 --> 04:25.792
<i>I found myself actually
feeling a sense a loss</i>

04:25.794 --> 04:27.544
<i>for my little friend.</i>

04:27.595 --> 04:29.346
<i>And as the rabbi approached
the casket,</i>

04:29.380 --> 04:31.298
<i>I really did feel at peace.</i>

04:31.300 --> 04:36.386
This morning, we're here
to memorialize a loved one,

04:36.437 --> 04:38.388
Buzz, your fly.

04:42.059 --> 04:46.980
Blessed are you, <i>Adonai</i>,
creator of us all.

04:46.982 --> 04:49.366
Would there be anyone
that would like to

04:49.400 --> 04:51.985
share a little bit about Buzz?

04:52.036 --> 04:54.287
Do you want to go up
and say something?

04:54.322 --> 04:55.956
I go in front
right there?

04:55.990 --> 04:56.990
Yeah.

04:58.960 --> 05:03.380
Uh...

05:03.414 --> 05:04.998
Well, I met Buzz--

05:05.049 --> 05:06.249
No, no, like this way.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.468
Turn. Face me.

05:08.503 --> 05:10.921
- Oh, like right here.
- Yeah.

05:10.972 --> 05:13.223
- You stand wherever you want.
- Okay.

05:13.257 --> 05:16.142
I met Buzz, and, um,

05:16.177 --> 05:19.479
he was a friendly pet.

05:19.514 --> 05:24.901
In a way, it's kind of-- it's
funny because Buzz was a fly.

05:24.936 --> 05:29.072
But when-- wherever Buzz went,

05:29.106 --> 05:32.025
he's not flying anymore.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.194
Because it's right there
in the dirt.

05:34.196 --> 05:36.112
Thank you.
Thank you.

05:36.163 --> 05:37.948
Nathan, would you like to say
a few words?

05:37.999 --> 05:40.784
Good-bye and...

05:47.875 --> 05:50.377
<i>After the service,
one of Pet Haven's employees</i>

05:50.379 --> 05:54.548
<i>helped bury Buzz, and it was
time to bring in his gravestone.</i>

05:54.550 --> 05:57.551
<i>Sandblasted into a 6-foot slab
of solid granite,</i>

05:57.602 --> 06:00.136
<i>Buzz's gravestone
weighed nearly 3 tons</i>

06:00.187 --> 06:02.606
<i>and cost us $7,000 to make--</i>

06:02.640 --> 06:04.691
<i>a small price to pay
for a billboard</i>

06:04.725 --> 06:07.227
<i>that will last over 600 years.</i>

06:07.278 --> 06:11.481
<i>Once it was finally in place,
we unveiled the design for Mike.</i>

06:11.532 --> 06:13.366
<i>Along with Pet Mania's
name and address,</i>

06:13.401 --> 06:17.203
<i>I also added an extra incentive
to get mourners into the store.</i>

06:17.238 --> 06:20.240
- <i>But Mike wasn't impressed.</i>
- We need to talk about this.

06:20.242 --> 06:21.992
Is it cool, or...

06:22.043 --> 06:24.494
You notice there's nothing
like that around here.

06:24.545 --> 06:26.580
Yeah. Mike was concerned
it was too big.

06:26.582 --> 06:29.666
I can't put it there because
these are burial spots,

06:29.717 --> 06:31.418
so there's a lot of money
involved.

06:31.469 --> 06:33.837
I mean, money's not the issue
on a lot of things, but--

06:33.888 --> 06:36.840
What would it cost to keep it?
$500?

06:36.891 --> 06:38.508
Oh, no.
More than that.

06:38.559 --> 06:40.510
- $2,000.
- Minimum.

06:40.561 --> 06:43.513
<i>After a brief negotiation,
we agreed that for $2,000,</i>

06:43.564 --> 06:45.348
<i>it could stay forever.</i>

06:45.399 --> 06:48.151
<i>And within minutes, mourners
were already taking notice</i>

06:48.185 --> 06:51.154
<i>and likely thinking about
replacing their dead pets</i>

06:51.188 --> 06:52.739
<i>at Pet Mania.</i>

06:52.773 --> 06:55.108
<i>The next day, I brought Jennifer
to the pet cemetery</i>

06:55.110 --> 06:57.193
<i>to show her what I had done
for her business.</i>

06:57.244 --> 07:00.614
I think you'll find this is
exactly what we agreed upon.

07:00.616 --> 07:03.116
- Okay.
- Okay, when I count to three,

07:03.167 --> 07:05.619
I want you to take off
the blindfold, okay?

07:05.670 --> 07:09.089
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

07:11.008 --> 07:13.677
- Oh, my God.

07:13.711 --> 07:16.012
Huh?

07:16.047 --> 07:19.099
I don't--I wasn't expecting
that huge--

07:19.133 --> 07:22.302
I was just expecting, like,
a natural rock.

07:22.304 --> 07:24.304
Right.

07:24.306 --> 07:27.691
Well, it's certainly going to
bring people in to the store.

07:29.727 --> 07:31.478
Jennifer loved the ad,

07:31.529 --> 07:34.064
and all there was left to do
was celebrate.

07:34.115 --> 07:35.448
Champagne.

07:38.235 --> 07:39.736
- Oh, [bleep]!
- Oh.

07:40.988 --> 07:43.740
Okay.
Well...

07:45.826 --> 07:49.412
<i>I was so happy to give Pet Mania
the attention it deserved.</i>

07:49.463 --> 07:52.549
<i>And even though some might just
see it as an ad on a gravestone,</i>

07:52.583 --> 07:56.920
<i>to me, it was also the perfect
tribute to a friend.</i>

08:01.124 --> 08:03.092
<i>During the course
of making my show,</i>

08:03.126 --> 08:05.127
<i>I've run into a surprising
amount of people</i>

08:05.129 --> 08:07.046
- <i>I seem to rub the wrong way.</i>
- Take your pizza

08:07.097 --> 08:08.047
and stick it up your ass.

08:08.098 --> 08:09.215
You know what you are?

08:09.266 --> 08:10.600
You remind me of the Wizard
of Loneliness.

08:10.634 --> 08:13.084
You're playing r-- really
a dangerous game right now.

08:13.084 --> 08:13.854
Okay, I'm sorry.

08:13.854 --> 08:16.806
<i>I'm not sure why that is,
but I know that as a TV host</i>

08:16.887 --> 08:20.738
<i>having a personality that people
don't like is bad for business.</i>

08:20.894 --> 08:23.312
<i>And that's why
I needed to make a change.</i>

08:23.363 --> 08:25.615
<i>So for the first week of
shooting my show this season,</i>

08:25.649 --> 08:27.817
<i>I hired a focus group
that represents</i>

08:27.819 --> 08:30.119
<i>a cross-section
of American society</i>

08:30.153 --> 08:32.871
<i>to watch my every move
from a nearby box truck.</i>

08:32.905 --> 08:35.041
Tell me a little bit
about your business.

08:35.075 --> 08:38.126
We have the doors.
We have mahogany wood.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.578
<i>Using a hidden ear piece,</i>

08:39.630 --> 08:42.548
<i>they were able to give me
real-time feedback on the fly...</i>

08:42.582 --> 08:43.749
We have oak.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.501
Express yourself
with your hands,

08:45.503 --> 08:46.919
with your shoulders,
with anything.

08:46.970 --> 08:49.088
So you've got the best prices
in town.

08:49.139 --> 08:51.224
<i>...that would help me become
a more likable host.</i>

08:51.258 --> 08:53.009
Wow.
That's really cool to hear.

08:53.011 --> 08:54.310
Yeah.
There you go.

08:54.344 --> 08:56.562
<i>They told me how to engage
with my audience more.</i>

08:58.398 --> 09:01.317
Like 500 models of doors
you could choose from.

09:01.351 --> 09:04.453
Now do you manufacture
all the doors in this building?

09:06.156 --> 09:08.941
We manufacture most of them
in this building, yes.

09:08.992 --> 09:10.359
There you go.
Good job.

09:10.361 --> 09:13.029
<i>And they also had some fashion
tips to make me more relatable.</i>

09:13.080 --> 09:15.164
I think a V-Neck
would go well with you.

09:15.198 --> 09:16.532
A V-Neck?
Really?

09:16.534 --> 09:17.867
A blazer.

09:17.918 --> 09:19.335
A T-Shirt with a blazer
might work.

09:19.369 --> 09:21.254
Yeah. That's sort of
a popular style right now.

09:21.288 --> 09:22.371
Yeah.

09:22.422 --> 09:24.040
<i>The only issue
we encountered early on</i>

09:24.091 --> 09:26.125
<i>was that it was hard
for the group to stay focused</i>

09:26.176 --> 09:28.177
<i>while we were mobile.</i>

09:28.211 --> 09:30.046
- Whoa!
- Ohh...

09:30.097 --> 09:31.847
<i>But we quickly
found a solution to that</i>

09:31.882 --> 09:34.517
<i>by bolting down the tables
and strapping them in</i>

09:34.551 --> 09:36.052
<i>while the truck was moving.</i>

09:38.722 --> 09:41.891
<i>As the week went on,
I was able to evolve my style</i>

09:41.893 --> 09:44.226
<i>to become more in line
with their tastes,</i>

09:44.278 --> 09:46.979
<i>and a more likable me
was starting to take shape.</i>

09:47.030 --> 09:49.065
- Good to meet you, man.
- Good to meet you too.

09:49.067 --> 09:52.985
So tell me about
your foot massage parlor.

09:53.036 --> 09:54.153
Oh, there we go.

09:54.204 --> 09:55.571
Body motions are great.

09:55.573 --> 09:57.573
We also do facial
and head, too.

09:57.575 --> 10:00.710
Now, everyone loves
a foot massage, right?

10:00.744 --> 10:02.545
Oh, great.
He looked out at the camera.

10:02.579 --> 10:04.580
Great looking at the camera.
Good job.

10:04.582 --> 10:06.966
<i>The group was absolutely
loving who I was now.</i>

10:07.000 --> 10:09.135
Now, is that a soapy water
or is it just

10:09.169 --> 10:11.003
- plain water?
- Just the water, just clean,

10:11.054 --> 10:12.505
- pure-- just water, yes.
- Just water.

10:12.556 --> 10:14.056
Wow.
That's so interesting.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.058
- There you go.
- Good! Good.

10:16.093 --> 10:18.227
<i>And even though I was still
getting used to it,</i>

10:18.261 --> 10:21.397
<i>it seemed like I had become
a better version of me.</i>

10:21.431 --> 10:23.149
<i>But before fully committing
to this,</i>

10:23.183 --> 10:24.767
<i>I wanted to put
my new personality</i>

10:24.818 --> 10:26.686
<i>through the ultimate test.</i>

10:26.737 --> 10:28.604
<i>And we'll see that in a bit.</i>

10:28.655 --> 10:29.989
<i>But first...</i>

10:30.023 --> 10:32.441
<i>Having a professional maid
come to your home</i>

10:32.443 --> 10:34.360
<i>is one of life's great luxuries.</i>

10:34.411 --> 10:37.279
<i>But what begins as a desire
to have a tidy house</i>

10:37.281 --> 10:39.615
<i>often turns into
a day-long dance</i>

10:39.666 --> 10:41.167
<i>where your home
isn't fully yours.</i>

10:41.201 --> 10:43.085
It's okay if I go
to cleaning around here?

10:43.120 --> 10:44.203
Oh, you wanna clean
in here now?

10:44.254 --> 10:45.371
- Here?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:45.422 --> 10:46.672
<i>A house clean</i>

10:46.707 --> 10:48.708
<i>is a full-day inconvenience.</i>

10:48.759 --> 10:51.877
<i>And that gave me an idea that
would help Candy Pallares,</i>

10:51.928 --> 10:54.213
<i>of The Help maid service
in Glendale, California,</i>

10:54.264 --> 10:56.632
<i>offer her customers
a speedier clean.</i>

10:56.634 --> 10:58.601
- Nathan.
- How are you doing?

10:58.635 --> 11:00.636
I always do a weak handshake
up front

11:00.687 --> 11:03.472
to establish
that I'm not a threat.

11:03.523 --> 11:04.690
Okay.

11:04.725 --> 11:06.058
- Okay.
- Okay. That's nice.

11:06.109 --> 11:07.309
- Just something--yeah.
- Oh, cool.

11:07.361 --> 11:10.229
<i>And after some small talk,
we got down to business.</i>

11:10.280 --> 11:12.782
A lot of people just want two
people there for two hours,

11:12.816 --> 11:15.484
and they usually can do
a general cleaning of things.

11:15.486 --> 11:17.653
So one maid takes four hours.

11:17.655 --> 11:19.655
Two maids takes two hours.

11:19.706 --> 11:21.824
- Mm-hm.
- By that logic,

11:21.826 --> 11:25.578
40 maids could clean a house
in six minutes.

11:25.629 --> 11:27.663
Yes.

11:27.665 --> 11:30.499
<i>By offering to clean houses
40 maids at a time,</i>

11:30.501 --> 11:32.501
<i>Candy would not only double
the amount of jobs,</i>

11:32.503 --> 11:35.638
<i>she could do in a day, but her
customers would likely pay</i>

11:35.672 --> 11:38.007
<i>a premium fee for a service
that allows them to have</i>

11:38.058 --> 11:39.842
<i>a spotless home
in the time it takes</i>

11:39.844 --> 11:42.678
<i>to go out
and grab a cup of coffee.</i>

11:42.680 --> 11:45.564
<i>The plan: For The Help to offer
the fastest clean in the country</i>

11:45.599 --> 11:47.566
<i>with 40 maids.</i>

11:47.601 --> 11:49.652
Well, if a customer, I mean,
asked for that--

11:49.686 --> 11:51.854
if they want 20 people,
40 people in their house,

11:51.905 --> 11:53.856
I could provide it
because I have the teams.

11:53.907 --> 11:55.524
But they've never
really asked for

11:55.526 --> 11:57.410
a turbo-clean
or anything like that.

11:57.444 --> 11:58.694
No one knows
to ask for something

11:58.696 --> 12:00.746
that hasn't been invented yet.

12:00.781 --> 12:03.199
It just-- I don't know
how it would work.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.700
<i>Candy was intrigued,</i>

12:04.751 --> 12:07.837
<i>but knowing that coordination
would be our biggest challenge,</i>

12:07.871 --> 12:09.872
<i>I first needed to do a test.</i>

12:09.923 --> 12:12.374
<i>So I found a guy who was willing
to try out the service...</i>

12:12.376 --> 12:14.543
Do you know that measurements
of this room?

12:14.545 --> 12:17.880
<i>and mapped out a detailed floor
plan of the inside of his house.</i>

12:17.882 --> 12:19.765
Oh, is there something?

12:19.800 --> 12:21.300
Yeah.
I think somebody

12:21.351 --> 12:25.438
stepped in dog shit outside and
brought it in here, so...

12:25.472 --> 12:27.807
Oh.
I hope that wasn't me.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.446
So I guess they'll get that,
too, then.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.231
- That'd be great.
- Yeah.

12:35.282 --> 12:38.234
<i>With a house to clean, the next
day I had Candy assemble</i>

12:38.236 --> 12:41.570
<i>four of her best maids back at
the office to be team leaders.</i>

12:41.572 --> 12:44.824
Seven in the kitchen,
five in the living room...

12:44.875 --> 12:47.543
<i>And together, we came up
with a sure-fire plan</i>

12:47.577 --> 12:49.411
<i>to execute a six-minute clean.</i>

12:49.413 --> 12:52.665
<i>For this to work, the maids
would have to travel together,</i>

12:52.716 --> 12:55.384
<i>so I had a bus rented
and outfitted with branding.</i>

12:55.418 --> 12:57.419
<i>And I parked it
at a central location</i>

12:57.421 --> 12:59.255
<i>where all the maids could meet.</i>

12:59.257 --> 13:02.141
<i>Candy was able to assemble the
40 we needed from her roster.</i>

13:02.175 --> 13:04.343
<i>And after dividing them
into groups,</i>

13:04.394 --> 13:07.680
<i>the team leaders assigned each
individual maid a specific task.</i>

13:07.731 --> 13:10.266
<i>And after all the maids
loaded onto the bus,</i>

13:10.268 --> 13:12.151
<i>Candy had to head back
to the office.</i>

13:12.185 --> 13:14.270
<i>So it was all up to me
to make this work.</i>

13:14.321 --> 13:15.905
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

13:15.939 --> 13:18.240
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:18.997 --> 13:21.737
<i>Knowing that this would have
to be executed like clockwork,</i>

13:21.767 --> 13:24.398
<i>while en route to the house,
I made sure that each maid</i>

13:24.502 --> 13:26.385
<i>had her individual role
down pat.</i>

13:26.420 --> 13:28.170
What's your job?

13:28.172 --> 13:31.932
I'm doing the mopping
under the b-- the, uh, bed.

13:32.026 --> 13:33.744
You seem a bit unsure,
so I just--

13:33.958 --> 13:36.182
You can't be second-guessing
when we're in there.

13:36.184 --> 13:38.852
It's gonna go really fast.

13:38.854 --> 13:40.270
What's your job?

13:40.321 --> 13:42.522
The sink?
Is that gonna take six minutes,

13:42.573 --> 13:44.524
- The sink?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

13:44.526 --> 13:46.359
- It will take six minutes?
- Mm-hmm.

13:46.361 --> 13:47.444
Okay.

13:47.798 --> 13:50.049
<i>Moments later, we arrived
at the client's home.</i>

13:50.083 --> 13:52.802
<i>There was nothing more I could
do to prepare them now.</i>

13:52.836 --> 13:54.587
All right.
We're gonna do this.

13:54.638 --> 13:55.721
Okay.
Now?

13:55.756 --> 13:57.256
<i>Yeah.
The future of my concept</i>

13:57.307 --> 13:59.675
<i>was in the hands
of a bus full of maids.</i>

13:59.726 --> 14:02.561
All right.
Ready, go!

14:06.183 --> 14:07.900
Go, go, go.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.353
Faster.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

14:13.608 --> 14:15.441
Pick up the pace.

14:18.613 --> 14:20.496
Hurry in.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.751
It's cool, huh?

14:25.786 --> 14:28.704
Oh, yeah.
This is amazing.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here

14:39.132 --> 14:43.469
Are you in a relationship
right now?

14:43.471 --> 14:45.938
L.A. Is a really tough town

14:45.972 --> 14:47.773
to meet good people.

14:47.808 --> 14:51.861
So I guess that makes me
in between relationships.

14:58.702 --> 15:00.703
What was your last
relationship?

15:00.737 --> 15:03.873
Um, well, you know,
we were pretty serious

15:03.907 --> 15:06.325
and played house for a while.

15:06.327 --> 15:08.210
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

15:08.245 --> 15:11.414
She, uh,
married her ex-boyfriend,

15:11.465 --> 15:17.002
and, uh, I'm in L.A.
training dogs.

15:17.054 --> 15:18.804
Oh, crap.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.313
Hurry, hurry, hurry
as fast as you can.

15:30.017 --> 15:32.351
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

15:34.237 --> 15:35.905
Great job.
Come on, guys.

15:37.274 --> 15:39.191
Come on, guys.

15:41.361 --> 15:42.778
<i>Once all 40 maids were out,</i>

15:42.829 --> 15:46.582
<i>I brought Jim in to see if he
was satisfied with his clean.</i>

15:46.616 --> 15:49.168
It hasn't looked this good
since we moved in.

15:49.202 --> 15:52.171
Realistically, it hasn't looked
this good since I moved in.

15:52.205 --> 15:53.672
And this place was dirty, too,
I mean...

15:53.707 --> 15:55.124
- .
- You know.

15:55.175 --> 15:56.342
Yeah.
It looked terrible.

15:56.376 --> 15:57.760
All right, guys.

15:57.794 --> 15:59.378
We didn't hit our six minutes
exactly.

15:59.429 --> 16:02.381
We were 8 minutes
and 16 seconds.

16:02.383 --> 16:05.301
Regardless, Jim was very happy
with his clean.

16:05.352 --> 16:07.386
Amazing job.
Y'all did a wonderful job.

16:07.437 --> 16:10.639
Thank you very much.
Absolutely.

16:10.690 --> 16:11.974
What do you think of Jim?

16:12.025 --> 16:14.527
He's such a great guy
for hosting you, huh?

16:16.646 --> 16:19.482
And, uh... he's single...

16:19.533 --> 16:23.068
Ladies? I don't know if you're
rested in any of them.

16:23.070 --> 16:26.238
You're very kind, but they did
all the hard work.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.791
They deserve applause.
They really did a good job.

16:28.825 --> 16:30.075
- Thank you.
- If you're lucky,

16:30.127 --> 16:32.545
he could do
some hard work on you.

16:37.667 --> 16:40.302
All right.

16:40.337 --> 16:43.506
<i>I was so impressed that I pulled
off a rapid house clean,</i>

16:43.557 --> 16:45.307
<i>hopefully the first of many.</i>

16:45.342 --> 16:47.092
<i>And the next day,
I returned to see if Candy</i>

16:47.094 --> 16:50.095
<i>now saw the potential
of my idea.</i>

16:50.147 --> 16:52.848
I guess the biggest part
would be kind of coordinating

16:52.899 --> 16:55.100
to see how they get there
at the same time.

16:55.102 --> 16:59.572
But I think the cleaning itself,
I mean, seems like it's doable.

17:01.408 --> 17:03.192
And then it worked.

17:03.243 --> 17:04.492
- That's great.
- Yeah.

17:04.528 --> 17:06.662
And who knows?
Maybe we could do something

17:06.695 --> 17:08.079
- in the future.
- Yeah. Like what?

17:08.114 --> 17:10.950
Other tasks,
other opportunities.

17:11.001 --> 17:12.835
Yeah, yeah.
W-whatever.

17:12.868 --> 17:14.703
- I guess.
- Mm-hmm.

17:14.753 --> 17:17.089
Um...

17:17.123 --> 17:21.210
What are you doing...
later tonight?

17:21.261 --> 17:25.130
I'm gonna go have, I guess,
a late snack or something.

17:25.132 --> 17:26.765
Oh, yeah?
Alone or...

17:26.800 --> 17:28.217
With my husband.

17:28.268 --> 17:29.602
With your husband.

17:29.636 --> 17:31.220
Yeah.

17:35.859 --> 17:36.976
That's sweet.

17:36.978 --> 17:38.527
- Yeah.
- Uh...

17:38.562 --> 17:40.312
It was great meeting you,
you know.

17:40.314 --> 17:43.365
Good luck with your business.
I got to scoot, so...

17:43.400 --> 17:44.950
- Okay, well...
- That's cool.

17:44.985 --> 17:46.402
See you later.

17:57.357 --> 17:59.186
<i>Last season of my show,
I helped</i>

17:59.199 --> 18:01.533
<i>a private investigator
named Brian Wolfe</i>

18:01.535 --> 18:04.036
<i>who wasn't too fond
of my natural personality.</i>

18:04.087 --> 18:06.038
You're in a [bleep] pink shirt
and everything else.

18:06.089 --> 18:07.539
Oh, you're killing me.

18:07.541 --> 18:10.542
<i>But now, thanks to the advice
of a diverse focus group,</i>

18:10.544 --> 18:13.512
<i>I was able to transform
into a more likable person.</i>

18:13.793 --> 18:16.962
<i>So for my final test,
I visited Brian at his home</i>

18:17.013 --> 18:19.098
<i>to see what he thought of
the new me.</i>

18:19.132 --> 18:22.885
So I've come a long way so far,
thanks to you.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.437
Before I go in tonight
to talk to Brian,

18:25.472 --> 18:27.306
I just wanted to know
do I look okay?

18:27.357 --> 18:29.141
- Is all the... outfit?
- You look good.

18:29.143 --> 18:32.728
You're dressed, again--
it fits you perfect,

18:32.779 --> 18:34.563
the V-Neck and the blazer.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.365
- This is good?
- Yeah. It fits you.

18:36.399 --> 18:37.950
- It fits you.
- Okay. And so this is me.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.285
This is you.
Be proud of who you are.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.820
With those encouraging words,

18:41.871 --> 18:44.366
I marched into Brian's house
to see if my new personality

18:44.405 --> 18:45.738
would win him over.

18:45.789 --> 18:46.791
Brian.

18:46.997 --> 18:49.214
Nathan. How you doing?
How you been?

18:49.248 --> 18:50.715
I want to tell you something, Brian.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.502
Last time I was here,
I was a little nervous.

18:53.553 --> 18:54.669
Okay.

18:54.671 --> 18:55.670
And I wasn't really
being myself.

18:55.672 --> 18:58.423
So I thought
we could do this again.

18:58.474 --> 18:59.674
- Okay.
- And this time,

18:59.725 --> 19:01.176
you can get to know
the real me.

19:01.178 --> 19:02.511
Look at you.

19:02.562 --> 19:04.096
You're still a goober,
but that's just you.

19:04.147 --> 19:06.181
- You know what I mean?
- What are you talking about,

19:06.183 --> 19:07.349
Goober?
What's that mean?

19:07.400 --> 19:09.768
Goober just means
like a dork, a nerd.

19:09.819 --> 19:12.020
- I'm a nerd.
- You know you're a nerd.

19:12.071 --> 19:14.239
You've been a nerd
your entire life.

19:14.273 --> 19:16.191
There's nothing wrong
with being a [bleep] nerd.

19:16.193 --> 19:18.193
- You're a nerd.
- I'm not a nerd.

19:18.195 --> 19:20.278
All right, well, you know,
that's my opinion.

19:20.329 --> 19:21.863
Seriously, if I threw a football
at you right now,

19:21.865 --> 19:23.331
you think you could catch it?

19:23.366 --> 19:25.500
- I could catch the football.
- You can catch a football?

19:25.535 --> 19:27.702
- Yeah.
- I doubt it.

19:27.753 --> 19:30.038
I doubt you can catch
a football.

19:30.089 --> 19:31.706
Brian still didn't like me.

19:31.757 --> 19:34.676
And after all the work
I had done, I didn't know why.

19:34.710 --> 19:36.455
Don't be sad.
It's okay.

19:36.528 --> 19:38.150
<i>Then, when I returned
to the truck,</i>

19:38.200 --> 19:40.323
<i>I was shocked to discover
that the group was trying to</i>

19:40.346 --> 19:42.813
<i>distance themselves
from their own suggestions.</i>

19:42.847 --> 19:44.231
It's too low.

19:44.265 --> 19:46.767
The V-Neck.
It's just too low.

19:46.818 --> 19:48.652
Why didn't you speak up
before?

19:48.686 --> 19:50.654
I asked before I went in
if this was good.

19:50.688 --> 19:52.773
I didn't know it was gonna be
that low, man.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.608
What do you mean?
You didn't like the V-Neck?

19:54.659 --> 19:56.493
- Not that low.
- I asked you guys

19:56.527 --> 19:58.862
before I went in what do you
think of this look?

19:58.864 --> 20:00.781
- V-Neck is this, not here.
- You guys said

20:00.832 --> 20:03.367
- you liked the look.
- <i>It fits you perfectly,</i>

20:03.418 --> 20:05.335
<i>V-Neck and the blazer.</i>

20:05.713 --> 20:07.797
<i>That's when I realized
there was a major flaw</i>

20:07.848 --> 20:09.599
<i>with my entire experiment.</i>

20:09.633 --> 20:12.885
<i>This new personality
was based on the judgment</i>

20:12.887 --> 20:15.355
<i>of four people who had agreed
to work out of the back</i>

20:15.389 --> 20:17.357
<i>of a moving box truck.</i>

20:17.391 --> 20:19.225
<i>Of course it was flawed.</i>

20:19.276 --> 20:21.144
<i>In the end, maybe
there was nothing I could do</i>

20:21.195 --> 20:23.780
<i>to become the guy
that everyone loves.</i>

20:23.814 --> 20:25.615
<i>But for a brief moment in time,</i>

20:25.649 --> 20:28.234
<i>it felt nice thinking
that I had a chance.</i>

20:28.236 --> 20:30.570
Can I get a little
rubby-dub-dub?

20:30.572 --> 20:32.372
Ho ho ho ho!

20:32.406 --> 20:33.740
- Nice.
- Good one.

20:33.742 --> 20:34.907
Good one.
Good one.

20:34.958 --> 20:36.242
All right.
