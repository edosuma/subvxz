Previously on "Ninjago.."

00:02.698 --> 00:03.742
The Sons of Garmadon

00:03.829 --> 00:04.743
they stole a powerful relic..

00:04.830 --> 00:06.484
...the Oni Mask.

00:06.571 --> 00:10.880
Whoever owns it
will yield tremendous power.

00:10.967 --> 00:14.101
Princess Harumi,
are you there?

00:14.188 --> 00:17.060

[instrumental music]

00:55.229 --> 00:56.143
[gasps]

01:01.887 --> 01:03.237
He's got the princess.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.576
You've got to be kidding me.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.071
Who are you?

01:57.029 --> 01:59.336
[sighs]
Princess!

01:59.423 --> 02:00.946
I thought you were kidnapped.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.122
I was trying to save you.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.601
Oh, is that what that was?

02:03.688 --> 02:05.255
From my vantage, it looked like

02:05.342 --> 02:07.953
I was the one saving you.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.912
Then, who's in the bag?

02:09.999 --> 02:12.001
You mean, what's in the bag?

02:12.088 --> 02:14.134
Food for the less fortunate.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.440
Even though I'm confined
to the palace

02:16.527 --> 02:18.094
I still try to give
what I can.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.357
But, your bedroom,
it was ransacked.

02:20.444 --> 02:23.491
Yes, I can be quite a slob.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.014
Thank you for noticing.

02:25.101 --> 02:26.537
I'm sorry,
I-I didn't mean--

02:26.624 --> 02:28.583
[Hutchins]
'The princess is gone!'

02:28.670 --> 02:30.759
Find her!

02:30.846 --> 02:32.064
They can't know
I left the palace.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.588
You have to disguise yourself.

02:33.675 --> 02:34.632
Hurry.

02:41.073 --> 02:43.989
[instrumental music]

02:46.078 --> 02:47.906
[fire crackling]

02:47.993 --> 02:48.951
[coughing]

02:51.867 --> 02:53.651
Something's are easier to do

02:53.738 --> 02:55.436
when you're not a princess.

02:55.523 --> 02:56.915
If I asked my parents

02:57.002 --> 02:58.830
they would never allow it.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.355
But these people
are hungry

03:01.442 --> 03:03.487
and we have so much food
in the palace.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.185
- 'Oh, oh, oh.'
- Oh, please.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.577
I need, I-I.. Please.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.536
Patience, little ones.

03:08.623 --> 03:10.451
There's enough for each of you.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.409
[children mumbling]

03:15.195 --> 03:17.022
[Lloyd]
Can I ask you a question?

03:17.109 --> 03:19.460
Do you enjoy
being a princess?

03:19.547 --> 03:23.246
Everyone thinks being a princess
is supposed to be easy

03:23.333 --> 03:27.946
and wonderful,
and I guess it's okay.

03:28.033 --> 03:31.211
But a lot of the time
it's really hard.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.169
[sighs]
Tell me about it.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.866
Not being a princess.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.217
I mean, being
the Green Ninja.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.611
We have to
live up to a role

03:40.698 --> 03:42.657
that was
bestowed upon us.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.050
We never chose
these mantles we hold.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.356
I know.

03:46.443 --> 03:48.489
It's hard to live
a normal life.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.534
At least,
I get to wear a mask.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.189
- But, you..
- I wear my own masks.

03:53.276 --> 03:57.802
Sometimes painted, sometimes
a kidnapper of princesses.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.848
[laughs]

03:59.935 --> 04:02.807
In my defense,
it was my first day.

04:05.636 --> 04:06.594
[glass shattering]

04:06.681 --> 04:09.074
[man laughing]

04:09.161 --> 04:10.511
[indistinct chatter]

04:10.598 --> 04:11.773
[all laughing]

04:11.860 --> 04:13.601
- That one.
- We must leave.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.733
These people have enough
to worry about.

04:15.820 --> 04:16.952
They shouldn't have to be
bullied by

04:17.039 --> 04:17.953
low level street thugs.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.041
Don't!

04:19.128 --> 04:20.782
If you try to stop them

04:20.869 --> 04:22.610
you'll reveal us.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.394
Yeah, buddy. Yeah.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.569
[gasps]

04:25.656 --> 04:26.918
And what's wrong?

04:27.005 --> 04:29.921
That's the same symbol
I saw before.

04:30.008 --> 04:32.359
The Sons of Garmadon.

04:32.446 --> 04:33.621
He was my father.

04:33.708 --> 04:34.709
[grunts]

04:34.796 --> 04:37.059
No, you said it yourself

04:37.146 --> 04:39.191
they're only low level thugs.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.802
'They don't know anything.'

04:40.889 --> 04:42.456
'They only take orders.'

04:42.543 --> 04:45.502
it's the person
who gives them that scares me.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.025
I have to do something.

04:47.112 --> 04:50.028
[engine revving]

04:50.115 --> 04:52.770
[Harumi]
'Or you can let Samurai X
take care of it.'

04:55.643 --> 04:59.299
Step away from the pedestrians.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.605
- Samurai X!
- Let's split.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.957
[cheering]

05:06.044 --> 05:07.394
It's good to know that
Ninja aren't the only ones

05:07.481 --> 05:08.830
protecting Ninjago.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.746
Remember, kids,
look out for one another

05:11.833 --> 05:14.270
and stay safe.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.272
[engine revving]

05:16.359 --> 05:18.230
[tires screeching]

05:21.190 --> 05:24.411
- Who is Samurai X?
- I wish I knew.

05:24.498 --> 05:25.890
- Princess--
- Please.

05:27.239 --> 05:28.458
Call me Rumi.

05:28.545 --> 05:31.635
Ah, Rumi,
I should get you home.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.463
Yes, you should be home,
Your Highness.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.073
[gasps]
Hutchins.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.859
May I ask what you're doing
outside the palace?

05:37.946 --> 05:40.122
Rumi and I were just
going for a walk.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.080
[gasps]
Rumi, a walk!

05:42.167 --> 05:43.778
I-It was my idea.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.997
Please, don't
be angry with Lloyd.

05:46.084 --> 05:50.393
It's troubling to see you two
are on a first name basis.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.004
The streets are not safe
at nights, Your Highness.

05:53.091 --> 05:56.965
I must insist
you return with me at once.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.273
[instrumental music]

...sharing food..

06:11.936 --> 06:13.242
[grunts]

06:13.329 --> 06:14.286
Sounds a lot like a date.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.331
[grunts]

06:15.418 --> 06:17.289
It was not a date.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.857
A date, a social
or romantic engagement

06:19.944 --> 06:22.512
often involving a meal
over an intimate setting.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.949
[giggles]
You can't argue
with a Ninjaroid.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.734
Look, if you like
this girl

06:26.821 --> 06:28.562
you're gonna have to
step up your game.

06:28.649 --> 06:29.563
[grunts]

06:31.695 --> 06:33.480
What do you mean...game?

06:33.567 --> 06:36.308
It means,
one's ability to charm.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.399
You need to convince her why
you're the most logical mate.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.443
- Ow!
- If you want to impress her?

06:40.530 --> 06:41.575
You gotta act tough.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.054
Like,
flex your muscles and stuff.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.404
Break things.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.405
[grunts]

06:46.841 --> 06:47.798
[grunts]

06:47.885 --> 06:49.800
[laughs]

06:49.887 --> 06:52.107
[blows raspberry]
No way.
You got to make her laugh.

06:52.194 --> 06:53.369
Just ask Nya.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.110
She couldn't resist my
sense of humor.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.459
Ah..

06:56.546 --> 06:59.375
[grunts]
It's...an acquired taste.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.855
Don't listen to them.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.770
You gotta act cool.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.032
Like, you don't even care.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.903
- But, I do.
- Ah-ha!

07:05.990 --> 07:08.384
- So you admit it.
- 'Okay, stop.'

07:08.471 --> 07:10.821
All of you are really
not helping him.

07:10.908 --> 07:12.997
Look, just be yourself.

07:13.084 --> 07:15.652
It's so much easier than
trying to be someone you're not.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.306
[grunts]

07:17.393 --> 07:18.699
Ha-ha! Got you!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.050
[Emperor of Ninjago]
'What were you thinking,
Harumi?'

07:22.137 --> 07:25.009
You are a member
of the Royal Family of Ninjago.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.881
You can't just go
gallivanting off

07:26.968 --> 07:28.578
with a Ninja whenever you want.

07:28.665 --> 07:30.058
It's undignified.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.886
Not to mention dangerous.

07:31.973 --> 07:35.324
- But he's not just a Ninja.
- You are royalty.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.935
- He is not.
- I'm sorry.

07:38.022 --> 07:40.982
I have dishonored our name
and our house.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.810
No, Harumi.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.551
We're sorry.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.901
We all have a role to play

07:46.988 --> 07:48.772
and yours is in this palace.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.687
Your heart mustn't interfere.

07:50.774 --> 07:51.906
[sobbing]

07:53.298 --> 07:54.256
[gasps]

07:54.343 --> 07:55.475
[sobbing]

07:55.562 --> 07:56.476
Rumi..

07:58.042 --> 07:59.827
If you know
what's good for you

07:59.914 --> 08:02.264
stay away from her.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.528
What happened?

08:05.615 --> 08:07.399
I can be myself..

08:07.487 --> 08:09.750
...but not everyone
can be so lucky.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.969
[instrumental music]

08:13.536 --> 08:16.321
[Ultra Violet laughing]

08:16.408 --> 08:18.193
- Oh, yes!
- Hey, is that her?

08:18.280 --> 08:20.543
- Who else could it be?
- I hear she's crazy.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.545
[punk #1]
'Don't ever let her
hear you say that.'

08:22.632 --> 08:24.504
If she hears you call her crazy

08:24.591 --> 08:25.722
she'll go crazy.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.116
- Then stop sayin' it.
- 'Shh.'

08:28.203 --> 08:30.597
I heard she jumped out of
a ten storey building

08:30.684 --> 08:32.599
just 'cause she didn't want
to take the stairs.

08:32.686 --> 08:35.384
I heard she dragged a guy
in her bike for two miles

08:35.471 --> 08:37.429
just 'cause he was
lookin' at it the wrong way.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.388
If you two don't be quiet

08:39.475 --> 08:42.260
I have ways of shutting you up.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.262
Ah-ah, sorry, Ms. Violet

08:44.349 --> 08:46.830
but Mr. E requested we get you.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.180
Yeah-yeah. He said
something big's going down..

08:49.267 --> 08:50.965
Oh, is there going
to be a fight?

08:51.052 --> 08:52.706
Oh, yeah, Ms. Violet.

08:52.793 --> 08:57.058
- Eh, maybe a explosion or two.
- It's not Ms. Violet.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.060
It's Ultra Violet!

08:59.147 --> 09:01.018
[guffawing]

09:05.806 --> 09:07.590
[guard]
'Hey, stop right there!'

09:07.677 --> 09:08.852
Ah-ah! Hey, hey!

09:08.939 --> 09:11.115
I'm just trying to deliver mail.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.465
[Lloyd]
'It's okay, guys. I know him.'

09:13.553 --> 09:15.729
Sorry,
nobody goes into the palace.

09:15.816 --> 09:18.819
- I can deliver it to them.
- Uh, thanks.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.560
- See you next season.
- Season?

09:20.647 --> 09:22.736
You know,
fall, spring, summer

09:22.823 --> 09:23.737
whatever.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.832
[breathing heavily]

09:51.068 --> 09:52.156
Hello, there.

09:53.723 --> 09:54.637
[slurping]

09:55.464 --> 09:56.944
How did you..

09:57.031 --> 09:58.467
Who are you?

09:58.554 --> 10:02.036
Maybe that is a question
for me to ask.

10:02.123 --> 10:05.866
But first, why do you climb
the mountain?

10:05.953 --> 10:08.956
I just lost someone.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.480
My father should be sad
or angry.

10:11.567 --> 10:14.483
- But he's just, he's--
- Yes?

10:14.570 --> 10:16.398
He spends all his time
with his group

10:16.485 --> 10:17.486
singing and dancing.

10:17.573 --> 10:18.835
He's never home.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.794
Leaving all the chores
for me.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.883
With her gone,
I guess it's up to me

10:22.970 --> 10:24.841
to be the responsible one.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.582
He acts like nothing's happened.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.932
How can he sing and dance
at a time like this?

10:29.019 --> 10:32.457
[sighs]
Grief takes many shapes
and forms.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.242
Some sing and dance.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.810
Some climb mountains.

10:36.897 --> 10:39.029
Why did you climb the mountain?

10:39.116 --> 10:41.466
To find you, Cole.

10:41.553 --> 10:44.426
[instrumental music]

10:48.299 --> 10:51.781
And I'll find you, master.

10:52.826 --> 10:55.089

11:03.837 --> 11:04.925
[rumbling]

11:25.249 --> 11:27.991
[music continues]

11:30.254 --> 11:32.126
Blast zap.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.258
Guys, we've got a big problem.

11:34.345 --> 11:38.219
[Cole on earpiece]
'Blast zap.
There's blast zap. I saw a--'

11:38.306 --> 11:40.874
Cole, you're not coming in.
You have a bad signal.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.313
We've gotta get everyone
out of here.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.184
[Cole on earpiece]
'The whole palace is rigged
to explode.'

11:47.271 --> 11:48.446
'It was Hutchins.'

11:48.533 --> 11:49.447
We have to get
the Royal Family

11:49.534 --> 11:50.622
outta here.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.667
[intense music]

11:51.754 --> 11:53.930

11:54.017 --> 11:55.062

[engines revving]

12:03.374 --> 12:06.029
[whooping]

12:06.116 --> 12:08.379
Ah, what a beautiful night

12:08.466 --> 12:10.120
for a little mayhem.

12:10.207 --> 12:11.556
[laughs]

12:11.643 --> 12:12.775
[tires screeching]

12:12.862 --> 12:14.298
- Oh!
- Whoa!

12:16.561 --> 12:17.954
[tires screeching]

12:18.041 --> 12:19.086
Ah!

12:21.653 --> 12:23.220
I didn't even get

12:23.307 --> 12:26.789
your...name.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.096
[Nya]
Let's leave the boys
outta this.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.227
Hm?

12:30.314 --> 12:31.881
[engine revving]

12:32.664 --> 12:33.840
[grunting]

12:34.884 --> 12:36.059
[tires screeching]

12:39.889 --> 12:41.325

Oh-ho-ho!

12:42.413 --> 12:43.371
Yeah!

12:44.459 --> 12:46.374
[intense music]

12:51.118 --> 12:52.423
[engine revving]

12:57.211 --> 12:58.908
[Lloyd]
You did this.
You helped them.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.823
I had nothing to do
with this.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.434
Cole said he saw you in the
tunnels with the explosives.

13:03.521 --> 13:06.263
Whatever your friend saw,
it wasn't me.

13:06.350 --> 13:09.092
I have served this house
for the better part of my life.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.051
And have sworn to protect
the Royal Family.

13:11.138 --> 13:12.095
[Ultra Violet screaming]

13:12.182 --> 13:13.488
[Hutchins]
Watch out!

13:13.575 --> 13:14.706
You saved me?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.796
[Ultra Violet laughing]

13:18.928 --> 13:20.408
[grunting]

13:22.018 --> 13:23.977
Does anyone have eyes
on the princess?

13:27.284 --> 13:28.895
[scanner beeping]

13:29.809 --> 13:31.767
[Harumi coughing]

13:33.290 --> 13:35.162
[Zane]
Come with me, princess.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.903
We need to get you
out of here.

[Lloyd sighs]
You're okay?

13:54.050 --> 13:55.356
But what about the mask?

13:55.443 --> 13:57.706
[engine revving]

13:57.793 --> 13:58.750
[Jay]
Whoever you are

13:58.838 --> 14:00.927
you should've brought more help.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.625
[Kai]
Hands in the air.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.237
[intense music]

14:10.371 --> 14:12.112
[Jay gasps]
The Mask of Vengeance!

14:13.243 --> 14:14.984
[fire crackling]

14:27.344 --> 14:28.824
Really? Four arms?

14:28.911 --> 14:30.608
Pfft. Like that's new.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.306
Watch out!

14:32.393 --> 14:34.525

Ah!

14:53.283 --> 14:54.632
[swooshing]

14:54.719 --> 14:55.982
Can anyone stop him?

14:56.069 --> 14:57.157

15:08.864 --> 15:12.694
[Nya]
Uh, I think my brother
just destroyed

15:12.781 --> 15:13.913
[on earpiece]
'the Mask of Deception.'

15:14.000 --> 15:16.002
- What?
- That one was a fake.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.178
I procured the real ones
from the vaults below.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.223
- A fake?
- Forgive me, Your Highness.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.225
It is the Mask of Deception.

15:22.312 --> 15:24.488
I wasn't sure
if I could trust the Ninjas.

15:24.575 --> 15:25.707
I do now.

15:26.708 --> 15:27.665
[screeching]

15:29.102 --> 15:30.973
Take it and get the princess
out of here.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.366
But what about my parents?

15:32.453 --> 15:34.759
- I'll find them.
- I was wrong about you.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.065

Go!

Oh, yeah! Ha-ha-ha!

We have to get it.

Bad call.
Can't hide from me, Ninja.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.068
[Harumi]
What are you thinking?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.896
We can't get away from them
in this thing.

19:18.983 --> 19:22.422
Hey, now, this thing still has
a few surprises in her.

19:22.509 --> 19:25.512
Lloyd! They're not gonna
just let us sail away.

Where is Hutchins?

21:07.483 --> 21:08.571
Did they..

21:09.877 --> 21:11.705
I'm sorry, princess.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.228
They didn't make it.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.926
[intense music]

21:16.971 --> 21:18.451
What about the mask?

21:19.930 --> 21:21.845
I promise you,
we'll find the people

21:21.932 --> 21:23.064
responsible for this.

21:24.283 --> 21:28.591
Once again, I am alone.

21:28.678 --> 21:30.158
[Lloyd]
You're with us now.

21:30.245 --> 21:32.900
And we'll make sure to find out
who's behind all this.
