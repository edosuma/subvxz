00:01.579 --> 00:02.578
Hello.

00:02.754 --> 00:05.655
My name is Eric Jonrosh.

00:05.761 --> 00:07.861
I wrote tonight's teleplay.

00:08.208 --> 00:11.810
I based it on my best-selling
novel, <i>The Spoils of Babylon.</i>

00:11.812 --> 00:16.213
And, of course, I am no stranger
to the best seller list.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.782
I've written 13 of them,

00:17.784 --> 00:21.226
ranging from historical fiction
to romance.

00:21.490 --> 00:23.153
I've filmed half of them.

00:23.290 --> 00:26.291
Tonight, you'll see
some fine directing by myself

00:26.293 --> 00:28.793
and some decent acting
by a cast

00:28.795 --> 00:31.263
I personally put together
for <i>Spoils.</i>

00:31.265 --> 00:35.600
Bitter memories are associated
with some of the scenes.

00:35.602 --> 00:39.497
Methinks the light above
is an illusion.

00:40.574 --> 00:45.243
There is no escape
from this blackness.

00:45.245 --> 00:48.747
No escape.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.236
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna kill myself.

00:52.276 --> 00:53.885
Don't be ridiculous.

00:53.887 --> 00:58.740
What form of torture have you
wrought for me, Mephistopheles?

00:59.073 --> 01:02.007
Am I to blather away
my waning years,

01:02.043 --> 01:03.743
rehashing old triumphs?

01:03.797 --> 01:04.694
Is that my fate?

01:04.732 --> 01:06.232
<i>The Spoils of Babylon.</i>

01:06.821 --> 01:10.407
Tonight's episode is part five
of our thrilling story.

01:10.547 --> 01:12.347
Evil is afoot.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.036
Murder and evil--

01:14.245 --> 01:15.945
all in the name of love.

01:16.310 --> 01:19.232
For what other reason
do men commit evil?

01:19.669 --> 01:22.703
For what other reason
do men live?

01:23.016 --> 01:26.651
No, seriously,
you've got to believe me.

01:26.653 --> 01:29.372
It's critical
that you believe me.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.691
I'll have some more wine,
please.

01:32.935 --> 01:36.280
And I want to do that one again,
but not in this get-up.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.274
I would like
a costume change, please.

01:40.515 --> 01:44.302
Who is God's name
is in charge of costu--

01:44.304 --> 01:47.272
Won't you enjoy
the fifth installment

01:47.274 --> 01:49.608
of <i>The Spoils of Babylon?</i>

01:49.610 --> 01:52.644
Please, dear God,
please, pay attention

01:52.646 --> 01:54.843
to the young actor
playing Winston.

01:54.913 --> 01:56.746
His name is Marty Comanche,

01:56.781 --> 01:59.710
and I found him sleepwalking
through Laurel Canyon,

02:00.187 --> 02:01.186
high on mescaline.

02:01.188 --> 02:05.131
It was a very happy accident
that he could act.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.360
<i>Previously
on </i> The Spoils of Babylon <i>...</i>

02:10.330 --> 02:13.164
<i>My name is Devon Morehouse.</i>

02:13.166 --> 02:15.400
My story is an epic one.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.135
It looks like a carburetor.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.095
It will be our gift
to mankind.

02:20.167 --> 02:23.843
Have you told anybody else
about this carburetor?

02:23.910 --> 02:26.344
Just your father
and your brother, ma'am.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.881
I kicked heroin.
I can't kick you.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.684
I want you to guide
this company going forward.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.400
You're not even
on the board anymore.

02:35.751 --> 02:36.917
It's that tyrant, my sister.

02:36.919 --> 02:38.669
She's shutting us down.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.291
He's gone mad.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.893
He's gonna bring
this whole company down.

02:41.895 --> 02:46.031
If Devon won't come here,
then I shall go to him.

02:46.033 --> 02:49.091
This is my life,
or what remains of it.

03:13.255 --> 03:14.867
<i>Love you.
Marianne.</i>

03:16.764 --> 03:19.714
Her letters
were like a fine beaujolais.

03:20.390 --> 03:22.123
They fed my soul.

03:22.614 --> 03:25.148
So much life in them.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.374
She was growing
to be quite the young woman.

04:07.958 --> 04:10.626
Oh, dear lord Jesus.

04:10.689 --> 04:11.455
Hello.

04:11.663 --> 04:13.896
Devon, is that you?

04:14.084 --> 04:16.084
Cynthia.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.534
It is really you.

04:17.598 --> 04:20.031
I was just getting out
of the shower, Cynthia.

04:20.095 --> 04:21.928
Why are you calling?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.162
You know damn well
why I'm calling, Devon.

04:24.164 --> 04:27.419
It's these attacks on me
and Morehouse Conglomerated.

04:27.465 --> 04:30.599
Well, I thought
you might call.

04:30.828 --> 04:32.895
We need to talk.

04:33.000 --> 04:33.999
So talk.

04:34.062 --> 04:35.415
It's your dime.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.466
Not like this.

04:37.591 --> 04:40.025
Why don't you come out
to the Institute?

04:40.212 --> 04:42.279
Could be quite educational
for you.

04:42.302 --> 04:44.985
All right, Devon.
Have it your way.

04:45.115 --> 04:46.648
I'll meet you on your terms.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.520
But don't expect me
to be persuaded

04:48.522 --> 04:51.490
by your pseudoscience
and poetry.

04:51.599 --> 04:53.065
Bye, Devon.

04:54.261 --> 04:57.642
What's going on
in that head of yours, Cynthia?

05:06.572 --> 05:09.374
Is this thing really safe?

05:09.376 --> 05:10.508
Perfectly safe.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.577
Oh, what's that over there?

05:12.579 --> 05:14.012
Pithicantius jumborius.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.948
Commonly known
as great white sharks.

05:16.950 --> 05:20.799
The deadliest creatures
on earth... Next to man.

05:20.843 --> 05:22.543
Will they attack?

05:22.584 --> 05:24.651
Only if threatened.

05:24.693 --> 05:27.026
Sharks, like people,
are territorial.

05:27.088 --> 05:30.923
You have come here to protect
Morehouse Conglomerated

05:30.985 --> 05:32.151
and its stockholders.

05:32.213 --> 05:33.079
I agreed to meet you

05:33.141 --> 05:36.175
because I am here
to protect all of this.

05:36.236 --> 05:39.371
Devon, is it so wrong?
I'm a businesswoman.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.439
Morehouse needs
its offshore drilling.

05:41.441 --> 05:42.874
It needs
its munitions factories.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.510
It needs its chemical warfare
development centers.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.012
Take that away,
and what are we?

05:48.014 --> 05:50.281
A company
that our father envisioned.

05:51.275 --> 05:55.620
A company that serves mankind
for the greater good.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.222
And how will we survive,
huh?

05:57.224 --> 06:00.124
On the false promise
of power from the sun?

06:00.126 --> 06:01.526
On unicorns and rainbows?

06:01.528 --> 06:04.562
On a carburetor
that runs on little gas?

06:05.532 --> 06:06.998
How do you know
about the carburetor?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.601
Huh?
Oh, nothing... Really.

06:09.603 --> 06:12.604
No, I was talking
about a barberetor that suns on

06:12.606 --> 06:14.983
cherry brittle sass.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.444
It's Father.

06:19.446 --> 06:22.313
Father told me in his delirium.

06:22.315 --> 06:25.320
Did they ever find
the mysterious carburetor?

06:25.348 --> 06:27.266
Oh, no.

06:27.571 --> 06:28.470
No.

06:28.611 --> 06:30.745
- Huh.
- Never found it.

06:30.887 --> 06:33.854
- That's funny.
- I know.

06:33.916 --> 06:34.949
Funny indeed.

06:34.991 --> 06:36.824
Oh, thank you.

06:37.185 --> 06:38.250
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:38.312 --> 06:40.312
Oh, my.

06:40.353 --> 06:41.386
Um, how's the prime rib?

06:41.568 --> 06:43.201
- Pretty prime.
- I'll have that. Thank you.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.336
Excellent choice, madam.
And for you, sir?

06:45.338 --> 06:49.107
I'm just trying to find
any vegan options here.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.109
Come on, man,
it's an underwater steakhouse.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.510
Give me a break.

06:52.512 --> 06:53.903
Well, prime rib is fine.

06:53.922 --> 06:55.488
Thank you.

06:55.490 --> 06:56.722
Thank you so much.

06:56.724 --> 06:57.890
- Oh, and another thing?
- Yes, ma'am?

06:57.932 --> 06:59.232
Ah, yes, could I have a carafe

06:59.274 --> 07:01.807
of tomato soup,
two turkey legs--

07:01.829 --> 07:03.329
- Very nice.
- I'd like some cold cereal

07:03.391 --> 07:05.927
with some hot milk,
two pots of tea,

07:05.986 --> 07:09.520
and a white wine in a coffee mug
with a little bit of salt in it.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.962
- Okay, salt in it.
- Thank you so much.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.230
- Very good. Thank you.
- Thank you.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.464
- Oh, and one more thing.
- Yes?

07:13.466 --> 07:14.666
Could I have
a cotton blend napkin?

07:14.668 --> 07:16.701
Sometimes when you iron out
the regular napkins,

07:16.703 --> 07:18.102
they're too itchy
for my thighs.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.370
- I understand.
- Thank you very much.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.239
Thank you.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.085
- Buh-bye.
- Thank you.

07:25.073 --> 07:27.640
This here is the central brain

07:27.662 --> 07:29.862
for the whole
research laboratory.

07:30.485 --> 07:33.252
As you can see,
it's quite complex.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.219
It took me years to build this,

07:35.221 --> 07:39.090
with some help from
my associate Dixie Melonworth.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.062
Actually,
Devon's being modest.

07:42.043 --> 07:43.509
Computers aren't
my strong point.

07:44.030 --> 07:46.230
- Oh.
- What is your strong point?

07:46.232 --> 07:49.143
Oh, I'm a marine biologist,
missus...

07:49.190 --> 07:50.089
Morehouse.

07:50.171 --> 07:52.138
- Cynthia Morehouse.
- Oh.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.913
And if you're
a marine biologist,

07:53.915 --> 07:55.700
I am a space astronaut.

07:55.742 --> 08:00.611
- Dix-- I-I mean,
Dr. Melonworth has a-a PhD.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.014
in oceanographic studies.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.648
Come on, Devon.
Everyone knows she's your tart.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.153
How dare you?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.255
I am a scientist.

08:11.301 --> 08:15.023
What kind of science do
you need to lay on your back?

08:15.105 --> 08:16.538
What?

08:16.699 --> 08:18.276
You got a lot of nerve.

08:18.359 --> 08:20.393
Well, and you've only
got one nerve,

08:20.395 --> 08:21.625
and it's in his pants.

08:22.344 --> 08:27.207
- I will not stand here and be
insulted by this cold bitch.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.825
How dare you call me that?

08:31.311 --> 08:32.610
If you're gonna slap somebody,

08:32.611 --> 08:35.211
you really should
put more effort into it.

08:35.518 --> 08:37.650
You call that a slap?

08:37.732 --> 08:42.035
Yes.
An "s-l-a--"

08:42.457 --> 08:43.489
Slap.

08:43.551 --> 08:46.819
Honey, I can go all day.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.328
I'm sure you can,
with your legs in the air.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.740
At least I know
what it feels like.

08:53.857 --> 08:56.792
To be a prostitute?

08:56.944 --> 08:58.638
- To be a woman.

09:07.084 --> 09:09.286
Oh!

09:20.794 --> 09:26.330
That was, uh, wonderful.

09:26.332 --> 09:30.301
Dixie, um, please,
leave us for a second.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.963
I just-- I must have a word
with my sister.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.474
It's cool.

09:39.091 --> 09:41.226
Look to your heart.

09:41.616 --> 09:42.835
The world is changing.

09:43.023 --> 09:45.157
We can make it a better place
for our children.

09:45.230 --> 09:46.730
I-I "besqueech" you,

09:46.988 --> 09:48.120
Give up the munitions

09:48.122 --> 09:51.523
and chemical warfare side
of the business.

09:51.525 --> 09:54.426
Why did you sell off
all of your stock?

09:54.428 --> 09:59.664
I hated what the company--
my company, had become.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.336
I will consider selling off
our munitions business,

10:04.338 --> 10:06.739
our chemical warfare plants,
and I might even reconsider

10:06.741 --> 10:11.143
the offshore drilling
operations, under one condition.

10:11.145 --> 10:12.711
Name your price.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.480
- You return to the company.
- Never!

10:14.482 --> 10:16.749
I will grant back
your share of Morehouse stock.

10:16.751 --> 10:19.251
You will be named the chief
of Research and Development.

10:19.253 --> 10:21.587
You can keep
this underwater laboratory,

10:21.589 --> 10:23.689
and you can keep
that little tart as well.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.524
- But, Cyn--
- You will also have access

10:25.526 --> 10:28.394
to a company car, company plane,

10:28.396 --> 10:30.062
and three company bicycles.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.730
You'll have a lifetime supply
of beef.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.032
- Cyn--
- After five years

10:33.034 --> 10:34.533
of employment,
you will also be entitled

10:34.535 --> 10:35.768
to a small beach shack.

10:35.770 --> 10:38.137
You will have fresh orange juice
delivered to you every day.

10:38.139 --> 10:40.706
You have free child care
for your friends only.

10:40.708 --> 10:41.573
Not for you.

10:41.575 --> 10:43.242
After ten years, we will pay

10:43.244 --> 10:45.411
for any hair transplant surgery
you wish to get.

10:45.413 --> 10:47.346
- But, Cynthia--
- This is only the beginning,

10:47.348 --> 10:48.647
but I won't go into it now.

10:48.649 --> 10:52.418
You drive a hard bargain, sis.

10:52.420 --> 10:55.521
And I have one condition
of my own.

10:55.523 --> 10:57.089
I'm listening.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.124
I will come back
to Morehouse Conglomerated.

10:59.126 --> 11:02.294
I will work here
and in the New York office,

11:02.296 --> 11:06.732
But we shall never
cross paths.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.699
Please, Devon.

11:07.701 --> 11:08.767
I "besqueech" you.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.169
Is it that bad?

11:10.171 --> 11:14.773
I mean, do we love
each other that much?

11:14.775 --> 11:17.776
Take it or leave it.

11:32.292 --> 11:36.795
Winston's not gonna
like this.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.131
Mother, how could you?

11:39.133 --> 11:42.701
After all I've done to secure
those military contracts,

11:42.703 --> 11:46.171
After all the Washington
insiders I paid off.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.841
Winston,
the writing is on the wall.

11:48.843 --> 11:50.809
We're not
in the weapons business.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.145
People are against the war.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.547
We need to do something good
in public relations.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.815
- You never loved me.
- We need--

11:56.817 --> 11:58.517
You never loved me!

11:58.519 --> 12:00.319
Ever since the day I was born,

12:00.321 --> 12:02.554
there has been
some blight against me.

12:02.556 --> 12:06.859
I represent
some terrible shame for you.

12:06.861 --> 12:08.660
You don't have to tell me,

12:08.662 --> 12:11.864
I've felt it every day
of my life.

12:11.866 --> 12:13.699
This is
how you repay my loyalty.

12:13.701 --> 12:16.201
This is how you show
your appreciation

12:16.203 --> 12:18.904
for my years
of undying devotion.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.740
Everything I've ever done
or dreamed of doing

12:21.742 --> 12:23.709
has been for your approval.

12:23.711 --> 12:24.877
And for what?

12:24.879 --> 12:25.711
For what?

12:25.713 --> 12:28.914
To be cast aside
for a brother you hate.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.884
Winston, I think it's time
for a new assignment.

12:31.886 --> 12:35.654
I'm sending you to Saudi Arabia
to work with my Arab friends.

12:35.656 --> 12:36.922
Am I to be exiled?

12:36.924 --> 12:38.190
Exiled?
Exiled?

12:38.192 --> 12:40.259
There's quite a market
for foreign oil.

12:40.261 --> 12:42.594
- It's a good opportunity.
- Please, mother.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.563
I was doing so good.

12:44.565 --> 12:47.900
Please don't send me away.

12:47.902 --> 12:49.468
I'm sorry, son.

12:49.470 --> 12:52.471
There's no need for you here.

12:52.473 --> 12:54.306
I hate Devon Morehouse.

12:54.308 --> 12:58.210
I hate him
with every fiber of my being.

12:58.878 --> 13:02.514
You can't hate him...

13:02.516 --> 13:03.849
because he is your father!

13:03.851 --> 13:07.386
He is your father.

13:07.388 --> 13:09.655
My father?

13:09.657 --> 13:10.889
But you and he are--

13:10.891 --> 13:14.493
I see.

13:14.495 --> 13:16.929
Perhaps I should've
never been born!

13:16.931 --> 13:20.399
Perhaps I
should've never been born!

13:20.401 --> 13:21.800
But you were.

13:21.802 --> 13:26.471
And I both loved you
and hated you for it.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.240
I shall destroy him.

13:28.242 --> 13:31.910
Perhaps not the man himself,
but everything he loves.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.912
But everything he loves.

13:33.914 --> 13:34.913
I hate him.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.715
I hate him for your loving him,

13:36.717 --> 13:39.952
more than my hatred for the lack
of love for me,

13:39.954 --> 13:42.921
born out of your hatred
of your loving him

13:42.923 --> 13:44.623
more than your hatred
of my hatred,

13:44.625 --> 13:47.826
for the forbidden love you hated
to have for him,

13:47.828 --> 13:49.394
hidden within my love for you.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.930
I hate him for the love he hated
to have for you,

13:51.932 --> 13:53.899
and for your own hatred of love,

13:53.901 --> 13:55.467
hidden within your love
of hatred,

13:55.469 --> 13:58.937
wrapped within your love
for me!

13:58.939 --> 14:03.475
I... hate... him.

14:09.901 --> 14:13.503
♪ Just the other day
what did I see ♪

14:13.554 --> 14:17.289
♪ Alone in the valley

14:17.291 --> 14:21.693

14:28.414 --> 14:31.989
<i>Dr. Dixie Melonworth drowned
while swimming in the ocean.</i>

14:32.973 --> 14:34.339
I never understood why.

14:34.341 --> 14:37.976
She couldn't swim,
and she hated water.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.612
I missed her terribly.

14:40.614 --> 14:45.584
That sharp, scientific mind
and her boobs.

14:45.586 --> 14:48.987
But I continued to work
as head of Research

14:48.989 --> 14:50.689
for Morehouse Conglomerated.

14:50.691 --> 14:55.894
Chet what's-his-name,
Cynthia's husband,

14:55.896 --> 14:56.928
<i>passed away too.</i>

14:56.930 --> 14:58.297
<i>No one really noticed.</i>

14:58.299 --> 15:00.065
Cynthia and I worked
very well together,

15:00.067 --> 15:03.669
rebuilding the company's image
and its mission.

15:03.671 --> 15:04.536
We kept our bargain.

15:04.538 --> 15:06.872
We never saw each other
in person.

15:06.874 --> 15:11.476
Our love could not bear
even a chance encounter.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.845
It seemed for a while
like peace

15:13.847 --> 15:16.748
would come
to the Morehouse name.

15:16.750 --> 15:22.854
But then, we had all
forgotten about...

15:22.856 --> 15:24.856
Winston.

15:31.432 --> 15:33.332
Tell me, Mr. Amed,

15:33.334 --> 15:37.336
If I deliver what you want
to your Shah of Iran,

15:37.338 --> 15:38.704
what guarantee do I have

15:38.706 --> 15:41.740
that he will honor
his end of the bargain?

15:41.742 --> 15:43.041
The Shah has given his word.

15:43.043 --> 15:48.980
If it is true that you can give
us what we want, then fear not.

15:48.982 --> 15:53.385
Morehouse Conglomerated
will gain handsomely

15:53.387 --> 15:54.519
from our dealings.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.055
And myself?

15:59.893 --> 16:01.660
A large sum will be placed

16:01.662 --> 16:05.831
in a Swiss bank account
with your name.

16:08.902 --> 16:12.070
A telephone call
for Mr. Winston.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.073
It is urgent.

16:15.075 --> 16:18.810
Excuse me.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.079
Winston, is it true?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.080
What, dear mother?

16:22.082 --> 16:24.383
You were not present
at the meeting of OPEC.

16:24.385 --> 16:25.083
Where are you?

16:25.085 --> 16:26.752
I know what I'm doing, mother.

16:26.754 --> 16:28.687
We will be ruined
without the help from the Arabs.

16:28.689 --> 16:30.756
We need that oil!
We are in a recession.

16:30.758 --> 16:33.692
Gas is going through the roof.
We have to make a deal.

16:33.694 --> 16:35.093
I am making a deal, mother!

16:35.095 --> 16:36.561
I'm making a much better deal

16:36.563 --> 16:38.130
than you could've
possibly imagined.

16:38.132 --> 16:39.464
It's my mother.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.134
- What are you up to?
- Good-bye, mother.

16:42.136 --> 16:43.969
- Bye-bye.
- Winston!

16:43.971 --> 16:46.004
Winston!

16:46.006 --> 16:46.738
Damn you!

16:46.740 --> 16:47.739
My apologies, gentlemen.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.541
Mother is an emotional person.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.980
Now, where were we?

16:54.982 --> 16:58.116
So do you have the documents
you talked about?

16:58.118 --> 17:00.452
Oh, I have the documents.

17:00.454 --> 17:01.486
But do we have a deal?

17:01.488 --> 17:03.922
Yeah, the Shah himself
will sign the deal

17:03.924 --> 17:06.724
once the documents
are handed over.

17:06.727 --> 17:07.492
Good.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.994
And the Shah shall come
to New York as planned.

17:09.997 --> 17:12.864
The Shah will be
at your mother's annual gala

17:12.866 --> 17:13.964
for the arts.

17:13.967 --> 17:17.002
The transaction
will take place there.

17:17.003 --> 17:20.137
You shall have your oil.

17:20.140 --> 17:24.776
You tell your Shah...

17:24.778 --> 17:29.648
that he shall have
his nuclear bomb.

17:45.082 --> 17:48.750
We have got to do something.
This company's going under.

17:48.789 --> 17:50.597
We need to make a deal
with the Arabs.

17:50.649 --> 17:51.984
The Arabs have money.

17:51.986 --> 17:53.105
It's no use.

17:53.107 --> 17:55.165
We are the only
major oil company

17:55.216 --> 17:56.849
without a deal with OPEC.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.376
We can't survive.

17:58.549 --> 18:01.570
The Arabs are buying.
We have to sell.

18:01.721 --> 18:03.688
Gentlemen!

18:07.324 --> 18:10.059
We do not have a deal
with the Arabs.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.190
We'll have to find
another way.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.949
This is all your fault,
Cynthia.

18:13.976 --> 18:17.044
You put that worthless son
of yours, Winston,

18:17.094 --> 18:18.612
in charge
of our foreign sales,

18:18.736 --> 18:19.835
and he couldn't make a deal

18:19.911 --> 18:23.113
if it was free ice
to the Eskimos.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.693
Not my best.

18:27.793 --> 18:28.792
You know what I mean.

18:28.916 --> 18:32.651
Morehouse Conglomerated
is finished.

18:32.848 --> 18:35.114
Where is Winston?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.298
I have it on good authority,

18:37.371 --> 18:41.728
Winston has told me himself,
he has made a deal.

18:41.792 --> 18:44.722
What-- What kind of a deal?

18:49.639 --> 18:52.808
Gentlemen, you have the--

18:52.932 --> 18:55.266
damn,
what are they called again?

18:55.561 --> 18:56.526
Oh, yeah.

18:56.838 --> 18:58.538
Documents?

18:59.004 --> 19:01.605
Of course, you know that if
these documents come to light,

19:01.643 --> 19:04.677
the military has no knowledge
of said such documents,

19:04.679 --> 19:08.742
nor any knowledge of how they
got into the wrong hands.

19:08.829 --> 19:11.330
More than understood, sir.

19:11.353 --> 19:12.418
Here's the plan.

19:12.420 --> 19:14.854
One, your man,
the Shah of Iran,

19:14.856 --> 19:16.389
shall have his nuclear bomb.

19:16.391 --> 19:18.291
Two, the balance of power
in the Middle East

19:18.293 --> 19:19.859
shall shift favorably
to the West.

19:19.861 --> 19:21.694
Three, Morehouse Conglomerated

19:21.696 --> 19:23.596
will be more powerful
than OPEC.

19:23.598 --> 19:27.300
And oh, yeah, four,
we shall all be a lot richer.

19:27.869 --> 19:29.402
I haven't the slightest idea

19:29.404 --> 19:31.838
what documents
you're talking about.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.440
More than
more than understood.

19:34.442 --> 19:37.610
So you have these documents?

19:37.612 --> 19:39.913
Well, we have this briefcase.

19:39.915 --> 19:41.814
It's filled with documents

19:41.816 --> 19:44.184
and other papers
of a document nature,

19:44.186 --> 19:46.753
but I have no idea
what the contents is, of course.

19:46.755 --> 19:48.922
These are the documents
that one would need

19:48.924 --> 19:50.890
of one was making
a nuclear bomb?

19:50.892 --> 19:52.358
- Oh, these?
- These documents?

19:52.360 --> 19:55.495
- Huh, who knows?
- Nor would we want to know.

19:55.497 --> 19:58.331
More than more
than understood, gentlemen.

19:58.333 --> 20:00.900
I shall make sure
that these documents

20:00.902 --> 20:01.901
get into the right hands.

20:01.903 --> 20:02.902
I'm not sure what documents

20:02.904 --> 20:04.337
you're talking about.

20:04.339 --> 20:07.344
- Good day, gentlemen.
- You were never here.

20:10.912 --> 20:14.681
Oh, Rod, I hope
we know what we're doing.

20:14.683 --> 20:16.482
It's the only way, Herman.

20:16.484 --> 20:19.519
If the Arabs control
the oil supply,

20:19.521 --> 20:20.920
this country's
gonna fall apart.

20:20.922 --> 20:23.223
There'll be rioting
in the streets.

20:23.225 --> 20:24.657
Utter chaos.

20:24.659 --> 20:26.799
Do you think
President Jimmy Carter's got

20:26.845 --> 20:29.262
the pope-sized cantaloupes
to get us through this mess?

20:29.264 --> 20:31.598
No, of course not, Rod.
Of course not.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.499
And I'll be goddamned

20:33.501 --> 20:35.935
if my grandchildren
are going to wait in line

20:35.937 --> 20:39.672
to pay
75Â¢ or even 80

20:39.674 --> 20:41.007
For a gallon of gas.

20:41.009 --> 20:45.645
It's not going to happen!

20:46.747 --> 20:50.283
It's not gonna happen.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.703
It's not
what we're fighting for.

20:55.292 --> 20:56.291
- Rod?

20:56.958 --> 20:59.525
Yes, Herman.

21:00.261 --> 21:03.863
I think
I'm falling in love with you.

21:03.865 --> 21:07.600
But I've never had the courage
to let you know

21:07.602 --> 21:11.451
What was in my heart,
until now.

21:31.156 --> 21:33.169
I wanted to spend
a little time tonight

21:33.222 --> 21:35.422
talking about the importance
of lighting,

21:35.941 --> 21:39.059
But there's some kind
of baboon here

21:39.116 --> 21:41.077
telling me
that I won't have time.

21:41.542 --> 21:44.276
I really don't even know
what that means.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.700
I have all the time
in the world to discuss

21:46.756 --> 21:49.857
lighting for film
and television production.

21:50.145 --> 21:53.135
The subject lends itself
to long discourses

21:53.164 --> 21:55.197
and theories,
for which I have many.

21:55.267 --> 21:57.473
So it makes no sense to me,

21:57.897 --> 22:02.395
Eric Cransler Jonrosh,

22:03.147 --> 22:05.610
that I'm being told
I can't talk.

22:06.088 --> 22:08.355
By the way,
how long are these shows

22:08.384 --> 22:10.200
we are doing going to last?

22:10.583 --> 22:12.583
30 seconds?

22:12.790 --> 22:13.756
Really?

22:14.411 --> 22:16.616
30-- Wait, 30 seconds
to talk about lighting?

22:16.623 --> 22:17.956
Impossible.

22:18.135 --> 22:19.301
We will need to go over

22:19.317 --> 22:21.750
and use up time
from one of the other shows.

22:21.752 --> 22:22.785
That's possible, right?

22:23.549 --> 22:25.146
I should think
that would be possible,

22:25.833 --> 22:29.703
that we could just borrow time
from-- from some of the other--
