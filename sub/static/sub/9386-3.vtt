WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:04.755
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.838 --> 00:07.966
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.050 --> 00:11.512
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.595 --> 00:14.306
On which we used to rely?

00:14.389 --> 00:18.018
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.101 --> 00:21.480
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.563 --> 00:22.981
All the things
that make us

00:23.065 --> 00:24.566
Laugh and cry

00:24.650 --> 00:29.863
He's...
a Fam...ily... Guy

00:41.625 --> 00:44.962
I must say I do feel
a strange satisfaction

00:45.045 --> 00:46.964
watching the black ball topple

00:47.047 --> 00:49.633
all those self-righteous
white pins.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.718
Can't blame 'em
for being self-righteous.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.846
The black ball's in
their neighborhood uninvited.

00:53.929 --> 00:56.682
The black ball's
done nothing wrong.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.935
If the black ball's innocent,
it has nothing to fear.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.522
Huh, wonder what
the hell's down there.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.191
(zapping)

01:06.275 --> 01:07.609
Judd Hirsch?

01:07.693 --> 01:09.444
Uh, hey.

01:09.528 --> 01:12.698
Uh, what, uh,
what's goin' on?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.242
Nothin'.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.743
All right.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.705
Hi, boys.
Your ride is here.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.875
Hey, you're just in time.
Mort's one ball away from a perfect game.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.918
Oh, God,
the pressure's too much.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.337
I just lost control
of my bladder.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.424
Oh, why didn't I clothespin
the end of my penis

01:30.507 --> 01:32.259
like Muriel told me to?

01:32.342 --> 01:33.719
(people chattering)

01:38.473 --> 01:41.185
Oh, my, God.
You bowled a perfect game.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.937
-(all cheering)
-(grunting) Mort! Yeah!

01:44.021 --> 01:46.440
I just never
stopped believing.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.400
Say no to acid.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.776
Jeez, relax, Mort.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.361
You'd think
you were God himself.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.946
No, he's over there.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.781
Hey, you want to see
what I can do?

01:54.865 --> 01:56.033
All right, ready?
Check it out.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.285
Beer, glass.
All right, now watch this.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.287
Oh, hey.
Guess I'll go over here for a minute.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.914
(humming)

02:01.997 --> 02:04.208
Oh, holy crap! That's still
pouring itself. Oh, wow.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.375
Oh, that's amazing.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.460
I've never seen
anyone do that.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.544
You want to go out later?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.588
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go tinkle.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.089
Okay, everybody ready?

02:11.173 --> 02:12.508
Hey, where's Quagmire?

02:17.721 --> 02:18.847
(sighs)

02:20.933 --> 02:23.101
GLENN (muttering):
Giggity goo. Goo goo goo goo giggity.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.776
(muttering continues)

02:34.863 --> 02:37.366
(Glenn groaning)

02:37.449 --> 02:39.368
GLENN: Would you just sit down
and go to the bathroom already?

02:40.702 --> 02:41.870
(screaming)

02:41.954 --> 02:43.997
A scandal at the Quahog
Bowling Alley tonight

02:44.081 --> 02:45.958
where a local man,
Glenn Quagmire,

02:46.041 --> 02:48.168
was charged with peeping
in the ladies' room.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.837
Coming up, Diane's weight.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.925
He's all yours, Joe.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.678
You know, you're lucky
I've got some extra pull around here

02:57.761 --> 02:59.805
thanks to my 18 medals
for heroism.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.974
Jeez, there he goes again
with the medals.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.893
Hey, Joe, if you love your medals so much,
why don't you marry 'em?

03:04.977 --> 03:06.895
(laughs)
I-- I did something like that once.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.814
And in the event
of your death,

03:08.897 --> 03:11.149
you'd like the insurance policy
to be paid to your wife?

03:11.233 --> 03:12.276
Yup.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.820
And your wife is
this piece of pie?

03:14.903 --> 03:17.698
You got it. Love you.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.741
Okay, sign here.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.578
You know what?
You can probably go ahead and cancel that.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.166
Well, well,
look who's here.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.502
All right, all right, look,
I know an apology is due here,

03:30.586 --> 03:34.590
so, Lois, tell Quagmire
you're sorry you had him arrested.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.300
Excuse me?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.010
He's the one
who owes me an apology.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.553
He was watching me
go to the bathroom.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.181
Well, clearly he thinks
you're attractive, Lois.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.473
It's a positive thing.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.976
Thank you, Glenn,
for complimenting our family.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.729
We have had it with
his disrespect for women.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.273
We're petitioning the city
to have him removed from the neighborhood.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.108
Yeah, I don't want
to bring a new baby

03:53.192 --> 03:55.110
into the world
with him running around.

03:55.194 --> 03:58.488
Okay, first of all, Bonnie, you've been
pregnant for, like, six years, all right?

03:58.572 --> 03:59.698
Either have the baby
or don't.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.783
Second of all,
Quagmire's a good guy.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.076
He's just
a little mixed up.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.286
(grunting)

04:08.790 --> 04:10.459
(both grunting)

04:13.962 --> 04:15.589
(tires screeching)

04:24.014 --> 04:25.724
(tires screeching)

04:30.062 --> 04:31.188
(tires screeching)

04:31.271 --> 04:32.689
(train horn blaring)

04:32.773 --> 04:34.858
(bell clanging)

05:06.348 --> 05:07.474
(band playing)

05:07.558 --> 05:09.643
This isn't medium rare.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.186
Then have them
take it back.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.646
(screaming)

05:14.022 --> 05:15.107
(both grunting)

05:26.994 --> 05:27.995
(crackling)

05:34.710 --> 05:36.587
(bell ringing)

05:36.670 --> 05:38.130
(ship's horn blowing)

05:40.007 --> 05:41.925
(people screaming)

05:44.803 --> 05:45.888
(tires screeching)

06:14.750 --> 06:16.335
(squawking)

06:29.598 --> 06:30.933
(Peter panting)

06:31.016 --> 06:32.267
Sorry about that.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.811
Second of all,
Quagmire's a good guy,

06:34.895 --> 06:36.396
you know?
He's just a little mixed up.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.689
That's all. Come on.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.066
Give him another chance, eh?

06:39.149 --> 06:41.193
All right.
But one more incident

06:41.276 --> 06:42.402
like the one
at the bowling alley

06:42.486 --> 06:44.404
and Quagmire is out
of this neighborhood.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.535
Now, don't worry
about a thing, Quagmire.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.537
Your pals are gonna
help you change your ways.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.248
Uh, I don't know, Peter.
I'm not sure I can do this.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.712
GLENN:
Meg, get out of the way.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.300
All right, Glenn,

07:05.384 --> 07:08.262
this exercise should help
teach you self-control.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.597
(fan humming)

07:10.681 --> 07:13.809
Here's this month's
Victoria's Secret catalog.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.227
Oh, oh, God. Oh, God.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.020
Uh, uh, d-- dead kittens.
Dead kittens.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.314
Uh, uh, old nuns.
Uh, really old nuns.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.483
Uh, Renee Zellweger.
Oh, there we go.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.026
-Yeah, yeah.
-All right.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.695
Oh, good. Good.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.616
Peter, are you sure
Quagmire is ready to be out in public?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.118
Nothing to
worry about, Lois.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.495
We figured out a foolproof
rehabilitation method.

07:33.579 --> 07:34.872
I got the idea
from when

07:34.955 --> 07:37.124
Brian had to wear that cone
after his operation.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.502
Okay, okay, if I make this,
we're all gonna get laid.

07:40.586 --> 07:43.088
Ha ha! Yes!
Score! Score!

07:43.172 --> 07:45.549
Boy, I'd really like
to chew on my crotch right now.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.886
Okay, Quagmire,
time to take off your training wheels.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.763
(exhales)
Okay, I think I'm ready.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.307
(chattering)

07:54.183 --> 07:55.225
(gulping)

07:57.186 --> 07:59.313
-Oh, boy.
-What's the matter, Glenn?

07:59.396 --> 08:00.606
Uh, nothing.

08:02.357 --> 08:05.444
Oh, Stacy, you dropped
your pom pom in the water.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.029
I'll get it for you.
I'll come with you.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.697
Me, too.
But wait a minute,

08:08.780 --> 08:10.657
we don't want to get
our sweaters all wet.

08:10.741 --> 08:11.992
Better take 'em off.

08:13.035 --> 08:14.203
Splash fight!

08:14.286 --> 08:16.079
(all giggling)

08:18.415 --> 08:20.042
(moaning)

08:20.125 --> 08:21.668
(groaning)

08:21.752 --> 08:24.046
(stuttering) Oh, God.
Oh, oh, oh... I need-- I need some air.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.130
I need some air!

08:29.426 --> 08:31.136
Aah, naked plastic chicks!

08:34.264 --> 08:35.599
(screaming)

08:41.730 --> 08:43.524
Where-- where am I?
Am I dead?

08:43.607 --> 08:45.692
No. This is where we monitor

08:45.776 --> 08:47.027
all the dressing rooms
in the mall

08:47.110 --> 08:49.321
so we can keep
an eye out for shoplifters.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.447
You don't say.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.952
Oh, my God!
That one's having a heart attack!

08:55.035 --> 08:56.370
(women exclaim)

09:01.542 --> 09:03.126
(blowing)

09:03.210 --> 09:05.587
(coughing)

09:05.671 --> 09:08.215
That was amazing.
You saved her life.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.050
Thank God
you know C.P.R.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.094
What the hell's C.P.R.?

09:15.097 --> 09:16.598
Congratulations, Quagmire.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.559
You're the newest member
of my Wall of Fame.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.727
What's wrong, Peter?

09:20.811 --> 09:23.105
Oh, it's nothing, Joe.
It's, I don't know.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.858
It's just that all you guys have
something to be proud of, you know?

09:25.941 --> 09:27.609
PETER:
Quagmire got a key to the city.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.444
Mort bowled a perfect game.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.738
You're always getting medals
for catching crooks.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.533
Hell, even Cleveland used to be
an accomplished auctioneer.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.118
(speaking rapidly)
I have 125. Do I hear 130?

09:36.201 --> 09:38.495
130,000 for this authentic
Comanche headdress?

09:38.579 --> 09:39.830
I got 130. I got 130.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.958
Do I hear 135? 140?
Do I hear 140?

09:43.041 --> 09:46.420
(speaking slowly)
135, going once.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.214
I-- I'm the only one here
who's got nothing, you know?

09:49.298 --> 09:52.426
If-- if I die tomorrow, there's nothing
people would remember me for.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.803
Not if you jumped off
a skyscraper

09:54.887 --> 09:57.431
and landed on
Joan Cusack.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.142
People would say,
"Hey, remember that guy

10:00.225 --> 10:02.477
who landed
on Joan Cusack?"

10:02.561 --> 10:04.104
Well, things are gonna change.

10:04.188 --> 10:07.608
From this day forth, people are gonna know
the name Peter Griffin,

10:07.691 --> 10:09.443
even if I have to shout it
from the rooftops.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.527
(heroic music plays)

10:10.611 --> 10:12.154
You hear that, world?

10:12.237 --> 10:15.199
I am gonna do something that
people will remember me for!

10:15.282 --> 10:16.533
(yelping)

10:16.617 --> 10:17.618
(thuds)

10:17.701 --> 10:19.912
Oh, oh, God! Sorry, sorry.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.206
Hey, Joan Cusack.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.498
Hello?

10:24.917 --> 10:25.959
Uh-oh.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.392
Peter, if you'd just
let me talk,

10:42.476 --> 10:44.311
I'll explain to you
why you shouldn't do this.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.521
Later. Later, Brian.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.481
I gotta do something
people will remember me for,

10:47.564 --> 10:51.318
which is why I've invented
a new type of flying machine.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.112
You know, I vaguely recall
seeing footage somewhere

10:54.196 --> 10:56.281
of something
exactly like this

10:56.365 --> 10:59.034
that, uh, leads me to believe
this probably won't work.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.994
All right, Stewie.
Let her rip.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.871
(propeller whirs)

11:02.955 --> 11:04.998
(yelps)

11:05.082 --> 11:08.085
All right, we attack
the Rice Krispie guys at dawn,

11:08.168 --> 11:09.920
assuming Judd Hirsch
delivers the goods.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.298
Brian, this time,

11:13.382 --> 11:15.717
I think I got just the thing
people will remember me for.

11:15.801 --> 11:19.179
I am gonna stop pollution
with my new lovable character,

11:19.263 --> 11:21.306
Gary the No-Trash Cougar.

11:23.851 --> 11:24.852
(gunshot)

11:24.935 --> 11:26.270
-(children gasping)
-Pick up your trash!

11:26.353 --> 11:28.230
I want to know
whose cup this is.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.314
(gun fires)

11:29.398 --> 11:31.608
I said I want to know
whose cup this is!

11:32.860 --> 11:35.571
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

11:35.654 --> 11:37.155
Thank you, sweetie.

11:37.239 --> 11:40.325
See what a nicer place this is
when we all pitch in?

11:40.409 --> 11:43.245
Like Gary the No-Trash
Cougar says,

11:43.328 --> 11:45.706
"Give a larbage,
throw out your garbage."

11:45.789 --> 11:46.790
Spread the word.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.000
(gun firing)

11:49.918 --> 11:51.295
(people chattering)

11:53.672 --> 11:55.382
Those freaking elves, man.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.050
They just came out
of the trees, man.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.886
They just came out
of the trees.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.429
You saved my ass
back there.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.722
You saved mine.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.183
Here's to Snap.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.350
To Snap.

12:06.435 --> 12:07.895
Oh, this sucks.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.105
I've been working
on this all week and I keep coming up dry.

12:10.189 --> 12:11.356
Who am I kidding?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.150
I'm never gonna
be remembered for anything.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.986
Not like
my great-great-uncles, the Siamese twins

12:16.069 --> 12:17.654
who fought each other
in the Civil War.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.114
I'm seceding.

12:19.198 --> 12:20.532
Like hell you are.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.494
Not too smart, huh?

12:24.578 --> 12:26.872
Yeah, did not think
that one through.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.832
Peter, you have to stop

12:28.916 --> 12:30.709
comparing yourself
to other people

12:30.792 --> 12:33.712
and find out
what's special about you.

12:33.795 --> 12:34.838
TOM (on TV):
In sadder news,

12:34.922 --> 12:36.632
the man who held
the Guinness World Record

12:36.715 --> 12:38.258
for most drugs ever done

12:38.342 --> 12:40.511
by a single human being
died today.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.763
He was attacked
by a pack of wild dogs

12:42.846 --> 12:44.389
he thought he saw.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.141
Ooh, there you go, Peter.

12:46.225 --> 12:47.726
You could break
a world record.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.770
What, are you nuts?
I got no special talents.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.730
W-- w-- what can I do
that nobody else does?

12:51.813 --> 12:53.690
Well, you just ate my tip.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.486
I got it!

13:03.617 --> 13:06.119
Peter, you're really
putting away those Mentos.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.621
Oh, these
aren't Mentos, Lois.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.581
Everybody,
you're looking at a guy

13:09.665 --> 13:11.917
who's gonna set
a new world record.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.086
I am gonna
eat more nickels

13:14.169 --> 13:16.672
than anyone has
ever eaten before.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.049
Setting this world record
is gonna make me famous

13:19.132 --> 13:20.801
just like the world's
fattest twins over there.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.012
Did I tell you
that I'm doing Atkins?

13:24.096 --> 13:25.472
Oh, that's not good
for you.

13:25.556 --> 13:27.599
(crickets chirping)

13:27.683 --> 13:29.601
(coins jingling)

13:31.270 --> 13:32.896
Dad, I just don't hear it.

13:32.980 --> 13:33.981
Come on!

13:34.064 --> 13:35.566
Really, Peter?
It just doesn't--

13:35.649 --> 13:37.192
-You're telling me that doesn't sound like
-Camptown Races?

13:37.276 --> 13:38.277
Not one bit.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.695
(laughing)

13:39.778 --> 13:41.738
Do Short People!

13:41.822 --> 13:43.323
Ugh, this is
the worst use of money

13:43.407 --> 13:44.867
since I tricked out
my big wheel.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.410
(stereo playing)

13:46.493 --> 13:47.744
(big wheel approaching)

13:52.958 --> 13:56.920
Hey, ladies. Check out
this ride, huh? Yeah.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.548
I'm off to make trouble
for the establishment.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.426
(crickets chirping)

14:02.509 --> 14:04.803
PETER:
I love you, Lois.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.222
LOIS:
Oh, I love you, too, Peter.

14:07.306 --> 14:09.474
-Even if you are full of nickels.
-(click)

14:09.558 --> 14:11.435
(coins jingling)

14:15.522 --> 14:19.109
(coins jingling faster)

14:22.070 --> 14:23.197
(jingling stops)

14:23.280 --> 14:25.073
-Good night, honey.
-(coins jingle softly)

14:27.659 --> 14:29.119
(alarm beeping)

14:34.082 --> 14:36.668
Oh, my God.
Lois, I can't see!

14:39.129 --> 14:40.297
DR. HARTMAN:
Uh, how about now?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.465
No, nothing.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.175
Well, that makes me
feel much better.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.093
You can't see
the spaceship, either.

14:45.177 --> 14:47.596
My cousin Marshall insists
if you look past the picture,

14:47.679 --> 14:49.139
you can see a spaceship.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.599
Can you please just tell us
what's wrong with my husband?

14:50.682 --> 14:52.267
Oh, yes. Uh, well, you see,

14:52.351 --> 14:55.020
after ingesting
such a large number of metal coins,

14:55.103 --> 14:57.731
Mr. Griffin appears
to have succumbed to nickel poisoning,

14:57.814 --> 14:59.024
causing him to
lose his sight.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.984
Oh, my God, Lois.
I'm blind as a bat.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.611
I can't see a damn thing.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.655
You know what else
you can't see? The writing on the wall.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.115
Vaudeville's dead
and TV's the box they're gonna bury it in.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.535
Back then, everybody had a specialty.
I, for one, am a tumbler.

15:09.618 --> 15:10.953
Watch me leap through
this big hoop.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.330
Vamp! Vamp!

15:14.331 --> 15:16.959
(playing vaudeville music)

15:23.048 --> 15:24.925
So we're all gonna
have to pitch in

15:25.008 --> 15:27.845
and help your father out
now that he's lost his sight.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.097
Nobody took care of me
when I lost my arms and legs

15:30.180 --> 15:32.975
and was struck blind,
deaf, and dumb.

15:33.058 --> 15:35.519
Hey, hey, Meg, they got
a Happy Days spoof in here,

15:35.602 --> 15:37.563
but they call it
Crappy Days.

15:37.646 --> 15:40.399
(laughing)

15:40.482 --> 15:42.234
All right, you know what?

15:42.317 --> 15:44.111
If you're not gonna laugh,
then I'm not gonna keep you company.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.946
This sucks.
Now the only thing

15:46.029 --> 15:47.948
anybody's gonna remember
me for after I die

15:48.031 --> 15:49.908
is being
that blind guy.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.368
Don't give up yet, Peter.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.871
I mean, many blind people
lead rich, fulfilling lives.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.581
(sighing)
I don't know, Brian.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.833
I mean, I guess
I can give it a shot.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.168
(laughing)

15:59.251 --> 16:01.712
Oh, my God!
I almost didn't do it!

16:01.795 --> 16:03.130
I almost didn't do it!

16:03.213 --> 16:04.256
I thought,
"Is this in bad taste?"

16:04.339 --> 16:05.966
But you know what?
I went for it.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.218
I went for it,
and I am so glad I did.

16:08.302 --> 16:11.013
Oh, worth it.
Totally worth it.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.056
(crickets chirping)

16:23.233 --> 16:25.861
Hey, you still awake,
Lois, honey?

16:25.944 --> 16:26.945
Dad?

16:27.029 --> 16:28.989
That's right.
I'm your daddy.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.825
Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh.
Don't talk, Lois. Don't talk.

16:31.909 --> 16:35.495
Just let me do
all the work. Yeah.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.582
Now feel my warm breath
on the nape of your neck.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.752
My hands on
your big, soft boobs

16:41.835 --> 16:43.587
running down
your big manlike...

16:43.670 --> 16:45.547
Holy crap, it's Chris.

16:45.631 --> 16:49.176
Uh, uh, so, uh,
how're you doing?

16:50.219 --> 16:52.179
Did you do
all your homework?

16:52.262 --> 16:53.805
Finish all your subjects?

16:53.889 --> 16:55.432
Yes, sir.
Good.

16:55.516 --> 16:57.267
Just, uh, just checking.

16:57.351 --> 16:58.936
Have a good night, son.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.605
PETER:
You still awake, honey?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.148
STEWIE:
What the deuce?

17:08.237 --> 17:09.655
Peter,
what the hell is that?

17:09.738 --> 17:11.281
Ah, this is my
seeing eye dog, Brutus.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.200
What do you need
a seeing eye dog for?

17:13.283 --> 17:14.743
Well, because
I can't do anything

17:14.826 --> 17:16.286
for myself, Brian.
I can't drive,

17:16.370 --> 17:18.163
I don't know when
to cross the street,

17:18.247 --> 17:20.165
and I took a dump
in the church confessional,

17:20.249 --> 17:22.417
which I guess they frown upon
if you're not homeless.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.711
I thought I could deal
with being blind at first,

17:24.795 --> 17:25.838
but I don't know.

17:25.921 --> 17:27.464
I-- I haven't felt
this out of place

17:27.548 --> 17:29.174
since that week
I lived with Superman.

17:31.218 --> 17:34.012
We must stop Lex Luthor
before he irradiates

17:34.096 --> 17:35.597
the world's supply of gold.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.140
Uh, hi. Uh, sorry.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.810
I know you got a meeting
going on, but, um...

17:39.893 --> 17:44.189
so we are officially
running low on Mr. Pibb and Cheez-Its.

17:44.273 --> 17:46.942
So, um, just
putting it out there.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.361
If you're heading
to the store later, uh,

17:49.444 --> 17:52.072
you know, uh,
800-mile drive for me,

17:52.155 --> 17:53.740
like, uh,
five seconds for you.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.075
Whatever. I'm not here.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.244
Peter, this is something
you're still adjusting to.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.079
You can't expect to
get used to it overnight.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.373
Whatever you say, Brian.
I'm going to The Clam.

18:01.498 --> 18:02.499
(door opens)

18:02.583 --> 18:03.584
(door closes)

18:03.667 --> 18:04.710
Did Peter leave?

18:04.793 --> 18:07.212
Yeah. Boy,
he's really down about this.

18:07.296 --> 18:09.840
Oh, I know.
I'm so worried about him.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.134
I've been looking into support groups
we could join to help him.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.427
Are you-- are...

18:13.510 --> 18:14.761
are you not
wearing makeup?

18:14.845 --> 18:16.513
Oh, no, I just--

18:16.597 --> 18:17.973
You know,
since Peter went blind,

18:18.056 --> 18:19.308
it's actually been
kind of nice

18:19.391 --> 18:21.602
not to have to worry
about my appearance.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.437
I see.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.355
Is it really noticeable?

18:25.439 --> 18:28.317
Well, a...
little mascara wouldn't kill you.

18:28.400 --> 18:32.237
Huh, I was kind of thinking
I'd try an au naturel thing.

18:32.321 --> 18:35.824
You think, uh, you think
you have the skin for that?

18:35.908 --> 18:37.951
(sign board buzzing)

18:38.035 --> 18:39.328
(people chattering)

18:39.411 --> 18:41.413
Oh, uh, let me light
that for you, babe.

18:41.538 --> 18:42.539
(lightning and thunder crashing)

18:42.623 --> 18:43.665
Wow!

18:43.749 --> 18:45.501
Yeah, magic fingers.

18:45.584 --> 18:46.585
(chuckles)

18:47.336 --> 18:48.879
Jesus Christ!

18:48.962 --> 18:51.173
-What?
-Get the Escalade. We're out of here.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.217
(people gasping)

18:53.300 --> 18:54.384
(glass shattering)

18:54.468 --> 18:56.011
(people screaming)

19:02.935 --> 19:03.977
(whimpering)

19:04.061 --> 19:06.063
Come on, girl.
I'm thirsty.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.147
(barking)

19:07.231 --> 19:08.315
All right, you don't want to come in?
Fine.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.275
I'll just tie you to
this parking meter.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.236
(barking)

19:12.319 --> 19:14.488
-(screaming)
-(barking)

19:18.450 --> 19:19.743
Hey, Horace, um,

19:19.826 --> 19:21.119
I'll have
a Pawtucket Patriot.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.246
(groaning)

19:22.329 --> 19:24.248
So how's your
hammer hanging?

19:24.331 --> 19:25.707
(sniffing)

19:25.791 --> 19:26.917
Hey, is somebody smoking
in here?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.126
(sniffs)

19:28.210 --> 19:29.461
Huh.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.880
Oh, hey, you ever watch
that show Scrubs?

19:31.964 --> 19:33.298
Yeah, Lois had it on
the other night

19:33.382 --> 19:34.716
and I was kind of
fading in and out.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.261
But, uh, you know,
I was watching a-and I'm wondering,

19:37.344 --> 19:39.721
which one is the funny guy?

19:39.805 --> 19:40.806
(grunts)

19:40.931 --> 19:42.474
Peter, grab my hand!

19:42.558 --> 19:44.017
Jeez, Horace,
you been drinking?

19:44.101 --> 19:45.310
Grab it and pull!

19:47.145 --> 19:48.522
Come on, let's go.

19:51.984 --> 19:53.902
And here comes
the heroic blind man.

19:53.986 --> 19:56.113
Tell us, sir, how did you
summon the courage

19:56.196 --> 19:57.906
to save your friend
from that burning building?

19:57.990 --> 19:59.867
That freaking place
was on fire?

19:59.950 --> 20:01.159
And there you have it.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.161
Coming up next,
watch me shave.

20:04.705 --> 20:06.623
Oh, Peter,
you're all right!

20:06.707 --> 20:09.626
Oh, I am so proud of you
for saving Horace's life.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.003
Yeah, Peter, you were amazing.

20:11.086 --> 20:14.214
Huh. You know, Brian,
I guess I was.

20:14.298 --> 20:15.799
And you know what else?

20:15.883 --> 20:18.010
People are gonna
remember me for this.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.344
(heroic music playing)

20:25.517 --> 20:28.145
("The Throne Room and End Title"
from Star Wars playing)

20:36.111 --> 20:37.196
(roars)

20:37.279 --> 20:38.447
(wails)

20:59.760 --> 21:01.094
(beeping)

21:02.888 --> 21:04.014
(beeping)

21:04.097 --> 21:05.766
(laughing)

21:09.186 --> 21:10.604
(roaring)

21:11.605 --> 21:12.689
(applause)

21:19.029 --> 21:22.032
(Star Wars theme music plays)
