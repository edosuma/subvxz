Oh, dang,
Times Circle's goin' nuts

00:41.780 --> 00:43.304
waiting for the cube to drop!

00:43.347 --> 00:45.088
We better hurry up
and finish writing down

00:45.132 --> 00:46.655
our resolutions for next year!

00:46.698 --> 00:48.178
I'm so excited,
I've already started

00:48.222 --> 00:50.006
counting down
the seconds till midnight.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.095
Seven thousand three hundred

00:52.139 --> 00:53.618
seven thousand three hundred
fifty...

00:53.662 --> 00:55.098
Y'all should keep talkin'.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.405
Ha! Finished.
Might be a tad ambitious

00:57.448 --> 00:59.015
but I think
I can make it happen.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.061
[Nancy]
"Stay the course"?

01:01.104 --> 01:02.236
Boo!

01:02.279 --> 01:03.933
Bill, that ain't
a real resolution.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.109
Listen, I know you're
a man of comfort...

01:06.153 --> 01:07.850
Hm? Pssh.

01:07.893 --> 01:10.113
But New Year's Eve is
a time to challenge yourself.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.942
To step out of your comfort
zone and try somethin' new.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.162
You know the phrase,
"New Year, new you."

01:15.205 --> 01:16.946
- Right, Gloria?
- Ehh.

01:16.989 --> 01:18.730
- Atta girl!
- Yeah, Bill!

01:18.774 --> 01:20.689
Be more extreme, like me!

01:20.732 --> 01:22.647
Ha! That was a kickflip!

01:22.691 --> 01:24.040
My resolution this year

01:24.084 --> 01:26.173
is to help Gloria
with her resolutions!

- the big dumpster fire that...
- Yep!

- We get it!
- So, whaddya got here?

01:36.661 --> 01:40.100
Whoa! Your New Year's
resolution is to ask out Kevin?

01:40.143 --> 01:42.014

that guy forever!

You haven't done it yet? Why?

01:44.060 --> 01:45.888
What's the worst
that could happen?

01:45.931 --> 01:48.064
There's literally so many
terrible things,

01:48.108 --> 01:49.500

01:49.544 --> 01:51.546
Kevin? [clears throat]

01:51.589 --> 01:53.939
I just wanted to say
that I like you

go out with me sometime?

What?!
You do not have a girlfriend.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.752
It's true.
Her name is Gabriella.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.014
And I got this photo as proof

02:25.057 --> 02:26.929
because no one ever believes me.

02:26.972 --> 02:29.192
And since I am now
a relationship expert,

02:29.236 --> 02:30.976
I'm gonna help you finally,
ask out Kevin.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.543
We can go find him tonight!

02:32.587 --> 02:34.676
- No-no-no-no-no-no...
- Ssh!

You're now in the capable hands
of Dr. Cricket G. Love.

02:38.375 --> 02:41.335
No thanks. Tonight I'll be
locking myself in my room.

02:42.945 --> 02:45.948
Gloria! It's time to
ask out Kevin and...

02:45.991 --> 02:48.124
- Oh, no.
- She cocooned herself.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.344
Ugh. Look, Gloria,
I know you're scared.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.868
I'm not scared.
It's just logistics.

[spits]

02:54.217 --> 02:55.740

to get down there.

02:57.568 --> 03:00.092

perfect! What's more romantic

03:00.136 --> 03:02.704
than declaring your feelings
at the stroke of midnight?

03:02.747 --> 03:04.271
I don't know what I'd say.

03:18.589 --> 03:21.375

03:21.418 --> 03:22.811

03:22.854 --> 03:24.291
- Ew! No! Gloria! Ugh! Bad!
- Ah!

03:24.334 --> 03:27.032
Control yourself!
Let's try, "Hi."

03:27.076 --> 03:29.078
Ugh. Hi, Kevin.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.819
Would you like some bread?

03:30.862 --> 03:32.690
[Tilly as Saxon]
Don't fill up on bread,

03:32.734 --> 03:34.475
- it's a scam!
- Tilly, you're not helping!

03:34.518 --> 03:35.998
Sorry, got lost in the game.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.826
No, no, this is good.

03:37.869 --> 03:40.045
Just a few more hours of
practice and I'll be ready.

03:40.089 --> 03:42.004
We'll take as much time
as you need.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.484
Actually,
there's only two thousand

03:43.527 --> 03:45.660
nine hundred forty one seconds
until midnight.

03:45.703 --> 03:48.271
Wait, that's short! I think.
Simulation's over, Gloria!

03:48.315 --> 03:51.666
Time to stand up, go to
Times Circle, and get yo man!

03:51.709 --> 03:53.407
- I'm gonna stand up!
- [both] Yeah!

white bread sandwich, again?

04:06.158 --> 04:08.160
Well, if you take a look
under the hood,

04:08.204 --> 04:10.119
you'll notice
a radical new change for me...

04:10.162 --> 04:11.860
Mayo!

04:11.903 --> 04:13.688
I wouldn't exactly
call a little mayo

04:13.731 --> 04:15.429
going outta your comfort zone.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.257
Hmm. Different strokes.

turkey sandwich in the fridge

04:33.969 --> 04:37.189
and then I eat a cold sandwich?
I'm more comfortable with that.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.931

out of your comfort zone.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.933

The crowd is way too big,

05:20.189 --> 05:22.017

from here.

Dang, you're right. Hmm...
[gasps]

05:24.236 --> 05:26.369
There might be one way
we can find him.

of the Times Circle Cube

05:29.067 --> 05:31.026

05:43.038 --> 05:46.389
[teeth chattering] Yep.
New experiences sure are f-fun.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.565
You sure you're up for this?
You're sweatin' so bad

[sighs] Okay, big guy,
I'm lettin' you off the hook.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.486
I think I pushed you too far.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.749
You are who you are
and that's okay.

05:58.793 --> 06:00.882
Yeah, you're boring! It's fine.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.927
Why don't you just
wait in the warm truck

06:02.971 --> 06:04.451
and Alice and I
will meet up with you

06:04.494 --> 06:06.061

06:21.076 --> 06:23.426
Come on, Gloria,

06:23.470 --> 06:25.254
No! If I don't ask Kevin out,

06:25.297 --> 06:27.125
he'll never get the chance
to reject me.

06:27.169 --> 06:29.432
You can't lose
if you don't try, right?

06:29.476 --> 06:32.827
Yeah, I'm just gonna stay here
and cling to this ladder.

06:32.870 --> 06:35.046
[grunts] Hey!
I can't get you a new job

06:35.090 --> 06:37.527
or a new apartment,
or a better haircut

06:37.571 --> 06:40.269
- What?!
- But I <i>can</i> be a good friend.

06:40.312 --> 06:42.140
And sometimes,
friends need to tell you

06:42.184 --> 06:43.707
when you're being
a total chicken!

06:43.751 --> 06:45.970
[sighs] You're right.
I came this far

06:46.014 --> 06:48.016

and get down from here.

There he is!

In a disappointing
turn of events, it appears

07:08.689 --> 07:10.342
the Times Circle Cube
is dropping

07:10.386 --> 07:12.214
several minutes early!

07:12.257 --> 07:14.521
Oh, no, our weight
is making the cube drop!

Dang it! I've been counting
all day, and for what!

07:17.306 --> 07:19.264
And for what?!

07:19.308 --> 07:21.179
Kevin can't see me like this!

07:21.223 --> 07:23.051
Don't worry, once the cube
reaches the bottom,

07:23.094 --> 07:26.010
we'll sneak off and no one
will know it was us!

Boo!

What a shame.

There she is, folks.
We may not know her name,

07:46.553 --> 07:48.076

as "The Girl
Who Ruined New Year's."

in front of the entire city.

front of my mom and my ex-wife.

to try new things

I wouldn't even be in this mess

if Cricket wasn't pushing me to
get out of my comfort zone.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.973
I mean, I'd like to
get out of my comfort zone

08:16.017 --> 08:17.540
but I don't want to be
uncomfortable!

08:17.584 --> 08:19.063
Sure, the thought of
asking out Kevin

08:19.107 --> 08:21.544
is an unbearable weight
that's crushing me whole.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.067
But what?
Am I supposed to...

08:23.111 --> 08:24.242
Do they expect me to just...

08:24.286 --> 08:25.940
[both]
Do something about it?

08:27.115 --> 08:29.378
- They might have a point.
- Yeah.

08:29.421 --> 08:32.686
Whatever happens, It's better
than feeling stuck like this.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.905
Maybe we both just need to jump.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.864
What time is it?
It's not too late!

08:36.907 --> 08:38.474
There's still time
to ask out Kevin.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.432
There's still time to
catch up to Nancy and Mom.

08:40.476 --> 08:41.999
I gotta run! See ya, Mr. Green!

08:42.043 --> 08:45.220
Me too! Good luck, Gloria!
Happy New Year!

08:45.263 --> 08:47.701
The cube has been reset
and we are now

08:47.744 --> 08:50.051
seconds away
from the stroke of midnight!

08:50.094 --> 08:51.618
Everyone please join me

08:51.661 --> 08:53.010
- in the countdown...
- Whoo!

08:53.054 --> 08:55.491
as we all try to pretend
it's the first time

08:55.535 --> 08:58.015
we've seen this tonight!
Here we go!

08:58.059 --> 09:02.063
[crowd]
Ten, Nine, Eight...

09:02.106 --> 09:05.588
- Seven, Six...
- Here comes the drop.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.286
Five, Four...

09:08.330 --> 09:10.201
New year, new me.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.769
- Go, Gloria, go!
- [crowd] Three, Two...

09:12.813 --> 09:15.119
You fool! The end is nigh.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.599
- [gasps]
- [crowd] One!

09:17.992 --> 09:20.516
[crowd roars]
Happy New Year!

09:21.735 --> 09:23.127
Hm?

09:23.171 --> 09:24.651
[splashes]

09:25.956 --> 09:27.001
[Nancy]
Mm-hmm!

09:27.044 --> 09:28.524
[giggles]

09:28.568 --> 09:30.134
Hey, Kevin.

09:30.178 --> 09:32.528
- I know you don't know me...
- No, I recognize you.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.530
You're the girl
who dropped the cube earlier.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.401
You don't know me...

09:36.445 --> 09:38.969
But I'm into you.

09:39.013 --> 09:41.189
Would you wanna go out sometime?

09:41.232 --> 09:45.889
Oh! You know, I'm not looking
for anything at the moment, so.

09:45.933 --> 09:49.501
Oh, yeah, cool! Um,
thank you for your time, sir.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.721
Uh, sure.

09:54.115 --> 09:57.205
Happy New Year, to one and all!

09:57.248 --> 09:59.468
- [gasping]
- [Benny] Aah!

09:59.511 --> 10:02.514
Yeah! I feel so alive,
so strong and...

10:02.558 --> 10:04.778
Oh, my gosh, that's cold!

10:04.821 --> 10:06.693
[teeth chattering]
I d-don't remember it

10:06.736 --> 10:09.173
- being this c-cold afterwards.
- [snaps]

10:09.217 --> 10:11.872
I don't wanna be extreme,
anymore.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.134
Not to worry, Ma.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.266
I packed us extra towels
and hand warmers.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.660
My resolution was to
break out of my comfort zone,

10:17.704 --> 10:19.053
not act like some lunatic.

10:19.096 --> 10:21.490
[chuckles]
Happy New Year, Bill.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.710
Ok, I think Gloria got, like,
mega rejected.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.929
So, let's just play it
real cool and chill and...

10:25.973 --> 10:27.539
Oh, my gosh, Gloria!

10:27.583 --> 10:29.672
- How's it going?
- Well,

10:29.716 --> 10:31.239
Kevin turned me down,

10:31.282 --> 10:33.458
but I actually,
feel kind of relieved!

10:33.502 --> 10:36.026
- She's in shock!
- No, no, it's okay.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.028
The worst case scenario
did happen

10:38.072 --> 10:40.509
and it wasn't nearly as bad
as I built it up to be.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.729
And if I can do something
that scary,

10:42.772 --> 10:44.600
then there's nothing
I can't do this year!

10:44.644 --> 10:47.690
I haven't felt this good
in months! [laughs]

10:47.734 --> 10:50.388
Oh, my gosh!
I'm gonna go eat a burrito!

10:50.432 --> 10:52.303
Happy New Year, everyone!

10:52.347 --> 10:54.697
Aw, look at how well
she handles failure.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.351
Taught her everything she knows!

10:56.394 --> 10:58.483
Well, I guess there's
nothing left to do

10:58.527 --> 11:00.355
but start the countdown
for next year!

11:00.398 --> 11:03.793
[deep breath] Forty-one
million, five hundred...
