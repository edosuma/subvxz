00:36.803 --> 00:38.999
Honey, I'm home.

01:04.096 --> 01:05.997
A meteor three times
the size of Earth

01:06.066 --> 01:08.262
is heading towards us
in a collision course

01:08.335 --> 01:10.201
that will result
in the extinction

01:10.270 --> 01:12.398
of all life on this planet.

01:12.472 --> 01:15.498
<i>This just in...
"No, it's not."</i>

01:15.576 --> 01:18.102
Oh, good.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.613
[growling]

01:20.681 --> 01:22.206
Ah, wrestling.

01:22.282 --> 01:23.977
[chuckling]

01:24.051 --> 01:26.679
<i>[announcer over TV]
An awesome display of power.</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:29.984
Don't you touch
that remote control.

01:30.057 --> 01:32.856
Don't you pick that up.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.485
You turn off that television,

01:34.561 --> 01:36.859
you're gonna be
one sorry little dinosaur.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.398
[click]

01:38.465 --> 01:39.762
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

01:39.833 --> 01:41.801
- Give me that back.
- Story.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.098
- No story.
- Story.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.433
- No story.
- Story!

01:44.505 --> 01:46.303
No story! Give me that back!

01:47.908 --> 01:50.741
Once upon a time,
dinosaurs didn't have families.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.212
They lived in the woods
and ate their children.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.840
- It was a golden age.
- [laughing]

01:55.916 --> 01:59.250
- Then what?
- Then one day, not long ago,

01:59.319 --> 02:02.482
daddy dinosaurs and mommy dinosaurs
started getting married

02:02.556 --> 02:04.820
and living in houses
and raising children.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.826
And lived
happily ever after.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.386
- Well, that was the idea.
- What happened?

02:09.463 --> 02:12.728
Some dinosaurs wondered if
they were doing the right thing.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.267
I wanna be in the story.

02:14.334 --> 02:17.793
You are, but it starts
just before you were born.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.033
Your mother was cooking dinner,
as usual,

02:20.107 --> 02:23.543
and dinner was trying to escape,
as usual.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.738
[male speaking on TV]

02:25.812 --> 02:27.246
[grunting]

02:27.314 --> 02:29.442
Why don't you show us
what's coming up next.

02:29.516 --> 02:32.042
[female on TV] Housewives,
tired of chasing dinner

02:32.119 --> 02:33.644
all over the house?

02:33.720 --> 02:36.280
You'll want this beautiful
32-piece cookware set

02:36.356 --> 02:39.257
featuring the new creature screen.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.352
Hey, lady, you might
want to see this.

02:42.429 --> 02:45.990
[male on TV] Arlene,
we've got 700,000 left.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.831
- At the rate they're going...
- [both] Hmm.

02:48.902 --> 02:52.236
- Huh?
- Fran, I'm home. I'm hungry.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.832
Oh! I'm stuck
in the door again.

02:54.908 --> 02:58.105
Earl, they are selling
the most wonderful thing here on TV.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.146
Why is there
not dinner on the table?

03:00.214 --> 03:01.682
- Yikes!
- Hey!

03:01.748 --> 03:03.147
Whoa!

03:03.217 --> 03:06.050
Was that dinner?
Did dinner just run out through my legs?

03:06.119 --> 03:08.611
They've got pots and pans
with creature screens.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.453
If you love me,
you'll get me them.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.959
- Do you love me?
- [groaning]

03:13.026 --> 03:15.825
I just got home.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.098
There's nothing in here.
No dinner, no vegetables.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.363
Dinner ate the vegetables.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.098
And then just left like that,
without coffee?

03:25.172 --> 03:26.731
Well, he's never coming back.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.502
Hi, Daddy.
How was your day?

03:28.575 --> 03:30.339
Not a dime, Charlene.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.276
Daddy, can't I say hello

03:32.346 --> 03:34.747
without you thinking
that I want something?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.380
A sweater.
I just want a sweater.

03:40.454 --> 03:43.219
I just want dinner.
It don't look good for either of us.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.849
You can have a frozen dinner.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.553
We've gota
frozen dinner right here.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.825
[Earl] Hey, frozen dinner.
Oh, that's great!

03:50.898 --> 03:53.765
I come home to a frozen dinner
on today of all days.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.895
- Obviously, you forget what today is.
- It's paycheck day.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.234
Paycheck day,
the day I get my check,

03:59.306 --> 04:01.331
and it says
how much I make.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.172
I'm sorry, Daddy.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.644
I'll set the table.

04:05.712 --> 04:09.910
And, uh, your apology
would go... how?

04:09.983 --> 04:13.578
Pots and pans to cook
your dinner with.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.849
Dinner for you.

04:14.922 --> 04:18.290
Gee, I don't know where
my apology should begin.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.656
Come on, honey,
you know I'd buy you the moon.

04:20.726 --> 04:21.853
I just want the pots.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.488
- No. Uh-uh.
- Why not?

04:23.564 --> 04:25.658
For once, there is something I want.

04:25.732 --> 04:28.724
It's unbelievable that
I should want to spend my money

04:28.802 --> 04:32.568
on something for me, something
I no longer feel I can be without.

04:32.639 --> 04:35.301
- What's that?
- A 90-inch television set.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.400
Earl Snead Sinclair!

04:37.477 --> 04:39.411
Oh, God.
My whole name.

04:39.479 --> 04:40.844
I am your wife.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.746
And I'm the mighty
megalosaurus!

04:42.816 --> 04:44.409
The king of the dinosaurs!

04:44.485 --> 04:46.317
The thunder lizard!

04:46.386 --> 04:50.254
If the thunder lizard
wants a 90-inch television set,

04:50.324 --> 04:52.622
he's gonna get
a 90-inch television set!

04:52.693 --> 04:54.787
So, what do you
have to say about that?

04:54.862 --> 04:57.661
The tyrannosaurus rex
is king of the dinosaurs.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.823
That's debatable.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.869
No, it's not.
I dated one in high school.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.425
Ooh.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.903
[door opening]

05:04.972 --> 05:08.306
This whole going to school
concept doesn't work.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.844
Here's my report card.
See you around the swamp.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.777
Ow! I knew it.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.905
Says here you
don't apply yourself.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.247
- Says you've got potential.
- That's a cheap motivational ploy.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.343
What, you don't
see through that? Ow!

05:20.420 --> 05:21.615
I knew it.

05:21.688 --> 05:24.282
Look, I'm having a hard time
with numbers and dates.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.348
Why?

05:25.425 --> 05:27.655
If this is the year
60,000,003,

05:27.728 --> 05:29.196
why is next year
60,000,0027

05:29.263 --> 05:31.595
Why count backwards?
What are we waiting for?

05:31.665 --> 05:34.635
Uh... Frannie?

05:35.736 --> 05:37.761
Maybe you ask
too many questions.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.602
School's not
for asking questions.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.732
It's a place you go
to be out of this house.

05:41.808 --> 05:44.470
Maybe we should consider
hiring Robbie a tutor.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.070
Could we get Connie DeSalvo?

05:46.146 --> 05:48.080
I could be motivated
to study with her.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.617
Come on, Earl.
How much could a tutor cost?

05:50.684 --> 05:53.984
Exactly the same price
as a 90-inch television.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.954
Because that's the way
my life works.

05:56.023 --> 06:00.051
I'm not giving up my TV because he's
not working up to his potential.

06:00.127 --> 06:03.119
Dad, I'm begging you to understand,
I have no potential.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.825
Come on, Earl,
you know the right thing to do.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.695
The right thing to do.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.635
Potential.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.138
- Am I in the story yet?
- I'm getting to you.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.177
- What happened next?
- I went to work.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.679
- Why?
- Because your mother makes me.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.043
- Am I at work?
- No.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.377
- Am I at work?
- No.

06:22.449 --> 06:25.043
- Am I at work?
- Yes. Yes.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.984
No, I'm not.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.447
[male] Let's start the swamp.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.720
[sawing]

06:32.793 --> 06:34.784
We need three men!

06:37.231 --> 06:38.460
Morning, Ed.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.261
Morning, Sid.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.835
Why is the right thing
always the one

06:43.904 --> 06:45.599
where I have to spend
all my money

06:45.672 --> 06:47.162
on nothing I get?

06:47.241 --> 06:49.437
Why does my life
have to be like this?

06:49.510 --> 06:52.377
Well, now, isn't this the
choice you made, pally boy?

06:52.446 --> 06:54.676
Getting married,
having a wife and kids

06:54.748 --> 06:56.238
and not eating 'em?

06:56.316 --> 06:58.785
This is new,
experimental stuff.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.549
I would, for once,
like to have some money in my pocket

07:01.622 --> 07:03.750
after my family spends
every cent I've got.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.758
Then you better march
into that trailer

07:05.826 --> 07:07.885
and ask Richfield
for a raise.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.454
Oh, well, I don't normally
talk to Mr. Richfield.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.658
And why not?

07:12.733 --> 07:15.134
Well, he's...
I'm just a regular tree pusher,

07:15.202 --> 07:16.863
and he's executive
supervisor.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.304
Have you recently seen
the size of his teeth?

07:19.373 --> 07:20.863
Well, that just may be, Earl,

07:20.941 --> 07:24.275
but this is for your family,
for your future.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.814
So, Roy, do you really think
the boss would give me a raise?

07:28.882 --> 07:32.375
Yeah. You gave this company
the best years of your life.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.820
Maybe not the best years
but certainly the least miserable years

07:35.889 --> 07:38.950
- of a generally crummy time I'm having.
- That's the spirit.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.721
Maybe I should go in right now.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.025
Thatta boy, Mr. Stand Up
to the Boss Sinclair.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.997
I'm gonna give that guy
what's what.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.898
You'll tell him where to get off.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.231
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

07:49.303 --> 07:50.737
Uh, wanna come in with me?

07:50.804 --> 07:52.203
No. Big teeth.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.762
[moans]

07:53.841 --> 07:56.742
[clock ticking]

07:56.810 --> 07:59.336
Mm-hm-hmm. Hm.

07:59.413 --> 08:01.780
Uh, excuse me.
Mr. Richfield?

08:01.849 --> 08:03.112
Ow!

08:03.183 --> 08:05.277
Oh, God.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.582
Why aren't you out there
knocking down trees?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.053
You're right. I should be.

08:09.122 --> 08:12.456
I'm leaving. I'm getting
out of here. Thank you.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.426
I have a family, Mr. Richfield.

08:14.495 --> 08:19.524
I can't afford to get my wife a present,
to buy my children things I'd like to.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.069
Tree pushers
get $4 an hour.

08:22.136 --> 08:24.867
Well, I need a raise.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.633
[clock stops ticking]

08:28.008 --> 08:30.340
[groaning]

08:32.546 --> 08:33.604
[exhales]

08:33.679 --> 08:36.876
Sinclair, you dog.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.384
Twenty years you work here.

08:38.452 --> 08:41.820
I never would have figured
you had it in you to take me on!

08:41.889 --> 08:43.687
But take me on you do,

08:43.756 --> 08:46.021
mano a mano, one-on-one.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.754
That's guts ball, Sinclair.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.490
I like a guy who plays
guts ball. Like it!

08:50.564 --> 08:53.625
- Ah!
- [Earl] Oh, well, thank you, sir.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.830
I guess I'm going to have to
take your ultimatum seriously, aren't I?

08:57.905 --> 08:59.339
I'd appreciate that, sir.

08:59.406 --> 09:02.273
A guy comes in here,
puts a gun to my head...

09:02.342 --> 09:04.140
No, I meant no gun, sir.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.873
...must be prepared
to back up his threat!

09:06.947 --> 09:08.540
So I'm gonna ask you,

09:08.615 --> 09:10.413
you want
a raise or what?

09:10.484 --> 09:12.350
Uh... or not.

09:12.419 --> 09:15.548
What puts you in a position to
come in here with your demands?

09:15.622 --> 09:17.920
Well, I got a wife and a family.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.085
Well, where is this my fault?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.355
I'm not blaming you.

09:21.428 --> 09:24.193
Then why do I have
to pay for your family?

09:24.264 --> 09:26.198
- I just need more money.
- Nah!

09:26.266 --> 09:30.066
The way I see it, you don't need
more money. You need less family!

09:30.137 --> 09:32.401
[stuttering] But I love my family.

09:32.473 --> 09:36.341
Well, obviously you do, since you're
ready to quit your job for them.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.777
- What?
- You face me down,

09:38.846 --> 09:41.406
demand more money,
I ain't gonna give it to you.

09:41.482 --> 09:44.417
So you got no alternative
but to say...

09:44.485 --> 09:46.283
- I'm sorry.
- I quit!

09:46.353 --> 09:47.582
“Quit?

09:47.654 --> 09:50.715
Oh, well, sorry to
lose you, Sinclair.

09:50.791 --> 09:54.728
- All these years...
- But, sir, I like this company.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.389
I always dreamed I'd go
somewhere with this company.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.556
Don't dream, Sinclair.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.604
No dreams for you.
You are what you are.

10:03.670 --> 10:07.538
That's all you're ever gonna be,
except not with this company.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.508
Best thing to do is realize that now.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.670
Best thing in the world.
You'll thank me.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.372
- But, sir...
- Thank me!

10:13.447 --> 10:17.645
Uh, thank you ever so...
Mr... Uh, goodbye.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.085
[growls]

10:20.154 --> 10:22.555
[humming]

10:24.391 --> 10:26.450
What a day.

10:29.263 --> 10:30.697
How was your day, dear?

10:30.764 --> 10:32.323
Compared to what, Fran?

10:32.399 --> 10:36.393
Compared to walking off a cliff, falling
10,000 feet, but living long enough

10:36.470 --> 10:39.531
to see that first vulture
swoop down and pick out my eyes?

10:39.606 --> 10:42.906
It's a tie.
Give me a beer.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.001
- [creature 1] No!
- [creature 2] Please!

10:45.078 --> 10:46.671
[creature 3] Mine, mine, mine!

10:46.747 --> 10:47.737
[all] Aw!

10:48.882 --> 10:52.341
Well, I had a rather
interesting day.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.410
Do you want to know
about my day?

10:54.488 --> 10:56.286
I'm done raising the kids.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.654
They're 12 and 14.
They're done.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.023
Whatever they're gonna be,
they're it.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.029
You really should ask me
about my day, Earl.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.429
Look, I say this
with all love and everything,

11:06.500 --> 11:09.128
but I don't give a damn
about your day.

11:09.203 --> 11:13.697
Ask me about my day.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.937
Frances, nothing that happened
in your little day

11:17.010 --> 11:20.776
has any impact on how I'm
gonna live the rest of my life.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.907
Oh, yeah?

11:35.996 --> 11:38.260
That better be breakfast.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.335
So, Mom, stop me if I'm being,
like, insensitive or anything,

11:49.409 --> 11:51.503
but you and Dad can
still have children?

11:51.578 --> 11:54.343
Looks like you're just going
to have to stop thinking

11:54.414 --> 11:56.439
of us as a couple of
old dinosaurs, huh?

11:56.517 --> 11:58.952
Did you and Daddy
really want another baby?

11:59.019 --> 12:02.114
Charlene, we feel
the same way about this egg

12:02.189 --> 12:04.851
as we felt
about Robbie and you.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.292
How in the hell
could this have happen?

12:07.361 --> 12:11.491
Gee, Daddy, just when you've
almost got us out of the house,

12:11.565 --> 12:15.001
you go ahead
and have another baby.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.867
This baby won't leave
for college till it's 18,

12:17.938 --> 12:20.464
which covers your allotted life span.

12:20.541 --> 12:23.169
You're either the world's
most dedicated father...

12:23.243 --> 12:25.769
[growling]

12:25.846 --> 12:27.439
Or not.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.877
In my 60s, Fran.

12:30.951 --> 12:34.512
I'm going to be in my 60s
before I get my life back.

12:36.557 --> 12:38.753
Unless there's nothing
in that egg.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.420
- What?
- Have you held it up to the light?

12:41.495 --> 12:42.792
Oh, don't be silly.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.764
How do you know it's not a dud?
It happens all the time!

12:45.833 --> 12:47.995
We had three duds before Charlene.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.934
No. We had two duds and Robbie.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.528
I'm saying!

12:51.605 --> 12:55.007
Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm having
an anxiety attack here, Fran.

12:55.075 --> 12:58.477
Maybe I don't need to.
Maybe there's nothing in there.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.411
Oh! Oh! Oh!

13:00.481 --> 13:04.008
Not that I'm saying anything bad
about the virtues of family life,

13:04.084 --> 13:07.384
but oh, jeez,
you're killing me, Fran.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.115
What I'm trying to say

13:09.189 --> 13:13.319
is that life holds
such enormous possibilities,

13:13.393 --> 13:17.057
as long as there's
nothing in there.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.296
[sucking]

13:23.704 --> 13:26.935
[groaning]

13:33.781 --> 13:37.217
Sweetheart, what do you think about
doing the walls of the baby's room

13:37.284 --> 13:39.343
in a cute little
dancing caveman motif?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.046
You know cavemen are all the rage

13:41.121 --> 13:44.250
with the little ones,
right, sweetheart?

13:44.324 --> 13:47.191
Earl? Earl?

13:49.696 --> 13:51.130
You took a walk?

13:51.198 --> 13:52.632
I took along walk.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.030
Because of me?

13:54.101 --> 13:56.468
- Because of a lot of things.
- But mostly me.

13:56.537 --> 13:59.598
Remember I told you that
dinosaurs lived in the forest

13:59.673 --> 14:01.107
- a long time ago?
- Me.

14:01.175 --> 14:04.770
And how we came out of the forest
to get married and have families?

14:04.845 --> 14:06.313
Am I in the story yet?

14:06.380 --> 14:09.748
I went back to the forest
to see if we were right.

14:09.817 --> 14:12.218
I'm gonna bite you now.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.380
[screams]

14:17.024 --> 14:21.257
[animal calls]

14:22.930 --> 14:24.364
OK, this is it,

14:24.431 --> 14:26.923
the wilderness
of my ancestors,

14:27.000 --> 14:31.062
where my spirit belongs
and my soul longs to be.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.768
Jeez, it's cold!

14:33.841 --> 14:35.741
[gasps]

14:35.809 --> 14:37.038
[grunts] So what?

14:37.111 --> 14:40.775
Small price to pay for
the freedom to do whatever I want.

14:40.848 --> 14:43.283
[chuckling]

14:43.350 --> 14:44.977
Whoa, sack-time.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.953
Hey, what am I
looking for, a bed?

14:48.021 --> 14:50.513
[laughing]
The ground is my bed.

14:50.591 --> 14:52.616
The rocks are my pillows,

14:52.693 --> 14:55.663
and my blanket
is the freezing air.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.322
[chuckling]

14:58.398 --> 15:00.298
[animals screeching]

15:00.367 --> 15:02.358
[birds squawking]

15:06.540 --> 15:08.008
This is nuts!

15:08.075 --> 15:10.669
How could wild dinosaurs
get any sleep out here?

15:10.744 --> 15:12.542
Wh-what? Ooh!

15:14.214 --> 15:16.911
OK, halt!
Who goes there?

15:16.984 --> 15:20.443
Just come out with your hands up
and offer me your meaty portions

15:20.521 --> 15:22.785
because you have
stumbled into the lair

15:22.856 --> 15:25.518
of the mighty megalosaurus, the...

15:25.592 --> 15:26.957
- Oh.
- You!

15:27.027 --> 15:30.190
- Do we know each other?
- Yeah, we know each other.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.198
In fact, my main course last night

15:32.266 --> 15:34.257
was supposed to be "you stew."

15:34.334 --> 15:38.396
But right now, I'll settle
for "come-as-you-are tartare."

15:38.472 --> 15:40.406
Well, if you plan
on eating me,

15:40.474 --> 15:43.239
please, go ahead.
You'd be doing me a favor actually.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.300
What do you mean?

15:44.378 --> 15:47.712
Well, I used to live here,
right on this spot.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.648
There used to be a tree here.
I lived in it with my family.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.015
Now, some idiot knocked
over these trees.

15:53.087 --> 15:55.181
I know my insurance
doesn't cover that.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.587
I don't know where
my family went.

15:57.658 --> 16:00.093
Look, just eat me
and get it over with, will you?

16:00.160 --> 16:03.186
That's awfully sporting
of you there, uh...

16:03.263 --> 16:04.822
Arthur. Arthur Rizzic.

16:04.898 --> 16:06.332
Earl. Earl Sinclair.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.129
- How you doing?
- Glad to know you.

16:08.202 --> 16:10.296
I'll let you in
on something, Rizzic.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.702
You're better off
being rid of your family.

16:12.773 --> 16:16.038
Oh, sure. Family's one
of civilization's worst ideas.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.168
You support them,
give them your money

16:18.245 --> 16:20.771
you put food on the table...
No offense, Rizzic.

16:20.848 --> 16:23.715
- None taken.
- And what do they do for you?

16:23.784 --> 16:27.743
They get you fired from
the only thing you were ever good at.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.812
[growling]

16:29.890 --> 16:32.450
[animals shrieking]

16:32.526 --> 16:34.460
You knocked all
these trees down?

16:34.528 --> 16:37.020
Yeah. And I done you
a favor there, Rizzic.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.531
Now without your family,

16:38.599 --> 16:41.864
you're wild and untamed
and free, huh?

16:41.935 --> 16:44.404
Maybe I've just got
a different perspective

16:44.471 --> 16:46.098
from my place
in the food chain.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.436
What do you mean?

16:47.508 --> 16:49.567
If I was a big dinosaur like you

16:49.643 --> 16:52.044
and everybody respected
and listened to me...

16:52.112 --> 16:55.309
- Everybody listens to you, right?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.316
Then maybe I wouldn't
need a family.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.376
To tell you the truth,
my family's all that listens to me.

17:00.454 --> 17:03.116
My house is the only place
where I'm the boss.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.750
So then without your family...

17:05.826 --> 17:07.760
I'm completely nothing,

17:07.828 --> 17:09.592
just alone out here
in the cold.

17:09.663 --> 17:13.497
Of course, your kind rules the world,
so you wouldn't understand.

17:13.567 --> 17:15.001
Uh, no, no,
of course not.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.366
I rule the world.
I'm the mighty...

17:17.438 --> 17:18.963
Uh... whatever.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.064
So why don't you just devour me,

17:21.141 --> 17:23.007
and let's call it a night.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.204
Uh, yeah, yeah. OK.

17:25.279 --> 17:26.440
[Rizzic] OK.

17:28.916 --> 17:30.975
[animals howling]

17:36.056 --> 17:38.650
[growls]

17:40.127 --> 17:41.856
Get out of here.

17:41.929 --> 17:43.328
Huh?

17:43.397 --> 17:44.762
Get out of here!

17:44.832 --> 17:46.425
- I won't forget this.
- Yeah!

17:46.500 --> 17:48.434
I'm too tired to eat!

17:48.502 --> 17:49.936
There's no ketchup.

17:50.003 --> 17:51.630
There's no beverage.

17:51.705 --> 17:53.366
Oh, this stinks!

17:56.009 --> 17:58.341
Oh, let me just
sit down and die

17:58.412 --> 18:00.278
because I'm just
a total disgrace

18:00.347 --> 18:02.076
to my ancestors.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.516
- [thud]
- [sniffs]

18:04.585 --> 18:05.643
What's that?

18:05.719 --> 18:06.982
[sniffs]

18:07.054 --> 18:08.351
That smells like...

18:08.422 --> 18:10.413
[gasps] It is!

18:10.491 --> 18:13.426
That's Fran's mastodon surprise!

18:13.494 --> 18:15.258
Out here in the wilderness!

18:15.329 --> 18:17.627
I'm saved! Oh!

18:19.333 --> 18:20.767
Huh?

18:20.834 --> 18:22.097
Hey!

18:22.169 --> 18:23.432
Hey!

18:23.504 --> 18:24.665
Whoa!

18:26.106 --> 18:27.198
[groans]

18:27.274 --> 18:29.072
[groans] Ohh!

18:54.134 --> 18:56.865
- I could've made it here.
- Of course, dear.

18:56.937 --> 18:58.371
So, what's for dessert?

18:58.439 --> 19:00.533
Chocolate hippo cake
at home.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.666
Ooh!

19:02.743 --> 19:06.179
[Earl] Uh, how you doing there,
Mr. Richfield, sir?

19:06.246 --> 19:09.341
Pursuant to the matter
of severing me from my job,

19:09.416 --> 19:13.353
I thought there might be
the matter of severance pay.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.479
Get back to work, Sinclair.

19:15.556 --> 19:18.821
You've had a change of heart,
my captain?

19:18.892 --> 19:21.259
No. I've had a report
from my new assistant.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.262
How you doing?

19:23.330 --> 19:26.061
No family.
Here all day and night.

19:26.133 --> 19:27.532
Nowhere else to go.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.535
Perfect executive material.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.300
Did you put Sinclair's name
back on the active roster?

19:32.372 --> 19:36.240
Yes, sir, and I put him down
for a raise in salary.

19:36.310 --> 19:37.937
[Richfield]
How much?

19:38.011 --> 19:39.536
Uh, imperceptible.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.047
Done.

19:41.115 --> 19:44.107
You were gonna be my dinner.
Now you're my boss' assistant.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.710
I've got to treat you
with respect and deference.

19:46.787 --> 19:48.721
Wow, I can't eat you at all.

19:48.789 --> 19:51.121
Oh, boy, kind of funny, huh?

19:52.426 --> 19:53.916
Get back to work, Sinclair.

19:53.994 --> 19:57.624
Yes, sir, Mr. Rizzic.
Yes, sir.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.427
What a world.

20:01.135 --> 20:04.127
Oh, the baby want to come out soon?
Oh, the baby...

20:04.204 --> 20:07.538
Hey, Fran, take a look at this.

20:07.608 --> 20:09.406
Earl, a paycheck!

20:09.476 --> 20:11.444
Note the imperceptible raise.

20:11.512 --> 20:13.742
Well, your career is taking off,

20:13.814 --> 20:16.249
you've got a wonderful
family to come home to.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.808
Are you a happy dinosaur, Earl?

20:18.886 --> 20:20.752
I think I am, Fran,

20:20.821 --> 20:22.721
because now I realize
what's special

20:22.790 --> 20:24.758
about being the head
of the household.

20:24.825 --> 20:26.020
What's that, dear?

20:26.093 --> 20:28.585
Robbie! Charlene!
Get your tails in here!

20:28.662 --> 20:30.221
This is your father talking,

20:30.297 --> 20:32.163
the king of the whole house.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.200
You see, Fran,

20:34.268 --> 20:36.828
I learned something during
my time in the woods.

20:36.904 --> 20:39.464
No matter how low
you are in this world,

20:39.540 --> 20:42.441
as long as you have
a family to come home to,

20:42.509 --> 20:44.637
well, they're lower.

20:44.711 --> 20:49.672
It isn't often I get to see
the sentimental side of you.

20:49.750 --> 20:53.186
All right, look,
I'm gonna say this one time.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.312
It's only natural
in a dinosaur's life

20:55.389 --> 20:58.848
to go off alone one day and wonder
what things would have been like

20:58.926 --> 21:02.453
if he had traveled a different road.
But you know what?

21:02.529 --> 21:03.928
I take a look at all of us,

21:03.997 --> 21:05.829
and I hope nothing
ever happens

21:05.899 --> 21:07.492
to change the way we are.

21:07.568 --> 21:09.127
[cracking]

21:11.004 --> 21:12.438
Oh, God.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.540
Oh, God!

21:18.645 --> 21:20.545
- Ta-da!
- Aah!

21:20.614 --> 21:22.548
Aah!

21:22.616 --> 21:23.981
Ohh! Ooh!

21:24.051 --> 21:25.951
Whoa!
I'm on the floor.

21:26.019 --> 21:27.316
Uh-oh!

21:27.388 --> 21:29.516
Lots of feet.
Can't get up!

21:29.590 --> 21:32.389
[groans]

21:32.459 --> 21:36.327
Oh, it's adorable.

21:37.164 --> 21:39.098
Whoa! I'm naked.

21:39.166 --> 21:41.225
Who's the mama?
Where's the mama?

21:41.301 --> 21:43.736
Come here,
you sweet thing.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.207
Oh, hi! How you doing?
How you doing?

21:50.744 --> 21:54.339
Earl, this is your baby.

21:54.414 --> 21:57.873
Baby, this is your daddy.

21:57.951 --> 21:59.885
Hi, I'm the baby, brand-new,

21:59.953 --> 22:01.421
just out, got to love me.

22:01.488 --> 22:04.480
Come on, got to love me.

22:07.861 --> 22:10.023
Daddy.

22:16.737 --> 22:19.638
That was a good story,
especially me.

22:19.706 --> 22:22.835
Yeah, that's the way you
came into this world,

22:22.910 --> 22:25.675
and someday,
it will all belong to you

22:25.746 --> 22:28.716
because you and your brother
and your sister

22:28.782 --> 22:31.012
were all born dinosaurs,

22:31.084 --> 22:33.212
and dinosaurs rule the world.

22:33.287 --> 22:34.413
Hmm.

22:34.488 --> 22:35.887
[scraping]

22:35.956 --> 22:37.890
[grunting]

22:37.958 --> 22:39.392
[chuckling]

22:39.460 --> 22:40.723
Aha!

22:40.794 --> 22:42.057
Ah!

22:42.129 --> 22:43.927
[groans]

22:43.997 --> 22:45.931
Ah, ha!

22:45.999 --> 22:48.161
[groaning]

22:49.736 --> 22:52.637
- Ah! Ha-ha!
- Ah!

22:55.409 --> 22:58.470
And we're gonna
rule the world forever.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.138
Ahh.
