WEBVTT

00:04.917 --> 00:07.920
- Everything I own,
my whole life, is ash.

00:07.964 --> 00:09.487
- Here.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.663
Go to my place, that's your new
home as long as you need it.

00:11.707 --> 00:13.796
- You and Kyle
would be great together,

00:13.839 --> 00:15.406
you should call him.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.756
- I was just wondering if you
want to have dinner with me.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.584
- Absolutely.

00:19.628 --> 00:22.065
- You've been pushing me away
ever since your dad died

00:22.109 --> 00:25.329
and I've done everything I can
to try and make this work.

00:25.373 --> 00:29.116
I love you, but I can't
be with you anymore.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.682
- Hey, Bradley Boyd.

00:30.726 --> 00:33.163
I'm hoping we can have the boat
seaworthy by summer.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.861
I realize it'll take up
a lot of your time.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.950
- You know what? I'm in.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.562
Looking for your dad?
- He's out with his girlfriend.

00:40.605 --> 00:41.737
- Grab a scraper.

00:43.521 --> 00:45.306
All right, bud,
so what are we looking for?

00:45.349 --> 00:47.873
- A two-part poly...

00:47.917 --> 00:49.614
whatever-it's-called varnish.

00:49.658 --> 00:50.659
- Polyurethane.

00:50.702 --> 00:53.705
- I was listening.
I always listen.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.055
- Yeah, you do.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.366
So where do you go to school?

01:02.410 --> 01:04.890
Tramble Academy
up in Highland Park.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.109
- How's that?

01:06.153 --> 01:07.371
- Most of the kids
live near it,

01:07.415 --> 01:09.373
so they get together
all the time.

01:09.417 --> 01:12.724
I just see them at school.
It's all right.

01:12.768 --> 01:15.379
- You know, I went to a school
I could ride my back to.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.903
- I didn't get a choice.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.209
Oh, is this it?

01:19.253 --> 01:20.906
It says "two part" on it.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.908
- That's the one.
- All right.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.397
- I'm getting pretty good
at this.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.791
- My secret plan is for you
to get so good at it,

01:35.834 --> 01:38.533
you hire me to work
on your gigantic yacht someday.

01:38.576 --> 01:39.621
- Deal.

01:41.013 --> 01:43.103
- The last thing I expected
was to be looking

01:43.146 --> 01:44.887
for a new place to live.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.367
Ooh! Can I help?

01:46.410 --> 01:48.151
I've watched so many episodes
of "House Hunters,"

01:48.195 --> 01:49.935
I'm basically
a qualified realtor.

01:49.979 --> 01:51.241
- I'll take all I can get.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.374
- Yes! Thank you,
I live for this stuff.

01:53.417 --> 01:54.810
Kyle's like,
"Can we go see a movie?

01:54.853 --> 01:57.117
and I'm like, "'Flip or Flop'
is about to start."

01:57.160 --> 01:59.031
- How's that going
with the chaplain?

01:59.075 --> 02:00.946
- Incredible. We click.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.818
- Hey.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.358
- Pretty sure this is why
there's a rule

02:21.402 --> 02:22.838
about not dating
in the firehouse.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.709
- The thing about rules
is they don't work

02:24.753 --> 02:26.015
unless you enforce them.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.625
- Severide's been in
some mood, man.

02:27.669 --> 02:31.281
- He has? Try riding in
the back of truck next to her.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.331
- What?

02:38.332 --> 02:40.856
- Uh, nothing.

02:40.899 --> 02:41.987
- No, what'd you say?

02:42.031 --> 02:43.815
- Uh...

02:43.859 --> 02:47.210
I was just commenting
on how, uh...

02:47.254 --> 02:49.952
When--when did you start
wearing your hair

02:49.995 --> 02:51.040
pulled back like that?

02:54.261 --> 02:55.827
- Okay, you know what?

02:55.871 --> 02:57.481
Let's just get this out
in the open.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.657
Yeah, Severide and I broke up.

02:59.701 --> 03:03.226
No, it will not affect
our ability to work together.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.228
We're both adults,
we're moving on.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.187
End of discussion.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.666
- Copy.
- Right.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.885
- Well stated.
- For sure.

03:09.928 --> 03:12.061
- All right?

03:12.104 --> 03:13.454
What is this?

03:14.585 --> 03:16.892
"Fire safety dog competition"?

03:19.199 --> 03:20.635
We should enter Tuesday!

03:20.678 --> 03:22.419
- Oh no, I'm not sure--

03:22.463 --> 03:24.639
- Oh, she can win this thing.

03:24.682 --> 03:25.857
Trust me,

03:25.901 --> 03:28.599
that dog is a superstar
in the making.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.514
- Right, but I-I-I'm
just not sure--

03:30.558 --> 03:31.863
- Traveling around
to different schools,

03:31.907 --> 03:33.517
teaching kids
stop, drop, and roll.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.171
Are you kidding me?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.738
- Okay, still.

03:36.781 --> 03:39.306
- Engine 51, Squad 3.
- Yeah, this is happening.

03:39.349 --> 03:40.872
- Vehicle accident.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.744
Intersection
of North State and Madison.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.109
- Oh, my God!
I saw the entire thing!

04:00.152 --> 04:02.546
It just flew straight into
the shelter at full speed!

04:02.590 --> 04:04.374
Didn't slow down or nothing.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.247
- Help! Help, please!

04:07.290 --> 04:08.378
- We have a victim underneath!

04:08.422 --> 04:10.032
Will you back off, ma'am?

04:10.075 --> 04:11.381
Casey, take the driver.

04:11.425 --> 04:12.948
Severide!
- Yeah!

04:12.991 --> 04:14.558
Capp, Cruz, Tony,
let's get cribbing

04:14.602 --> 04:15.951
and air bags under this bus.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.344
Let's lift the undercarriage
off the curb.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.432
- Copy that.
- Got it.

04:18.475 --> 04:19.694
- Anyone with minor injuries,

04:19.737 --> 04:21.478
sit over there
and we'll get to you!

04:21.522 --> 04:25.047
- Okay, 61 to Main, uh.
let's get an EMS Plan One.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.527
Set up the staging area

04:26.570 --> 04:29.312
at the intersection
of Congress and Michigan.

04:29.356 --> 04:32.750
- Ma'am hold on.
We're gonna get you out!

04:34.317 --> 04:35.971
- I can't move.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.277
- What's your name?

04:37.320 --> 04:38.365
- Brandon.
- All right, Brandon.

04:38.408 --> 04:39.583
Just stay focused on me.

04:39.627 --> 04:40.802
We're gonna get you
out of here.

04:40.845 --> 04:41.890
- All right.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.239
- Hey, Cruz,
where are those airbags?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.849
- Landing now!

04:47.765 --> 04:50.594
Brett, the driver's
having a seizure.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.596
- You gotta get her
out of there.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.337
- Can't extract until Squad
has the cribbing secured.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.425
Cruz?
- Two minutes.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.516
- What does she need?
- Versed.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.997
- Prep her for it.
Otis, grab me the grinder.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.391
- Copy.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.001
- Set!
- Go.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.746
- All right, almost there.

05:13.878 --> 05:15.967
- Good to go.
- Hey, Tony or Cruz.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.795
One of you guys,
get on the other side.

05:17.839 --> 05:18.970
- Yeah.

05:23.845 --> 05:24.889
Hold on!

05:24.933 --> 05:26.500
Hey, kid!

05:26.543 --> 05:28.023
Can you get under here
for Severide?

05:28.066 --> 05:29.459
- Yeah!

05:30.939 --> 05:33.985
- Grinder coming in.
- Come on, come on!

05:36.858 --> 05:39.295
- Hey, help me slide
this backboard underneath.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.123
- Yeah.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.485
- Ma'am, can you hear me?

05:55.529 --> 05:57.531
I'm gonna give you
5 milligrams of Versed.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.189
- Let it go, Brandon.
- You got it?

06:08.803 --> 06:10.326
- Okay.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.684
- Hey, Casey, we're all clear!

06:20.728 --> 06:23.252
- Okay, Truck, let's get
the driver out of here!

06:23.295 --> 06:24.949
Take him out.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.912
Easy.

06:32.653 --> 06:33.958
Slide her, pull her arm.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.917
- Okay.
- Watch your head.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.702
She seems stable.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.051
Let's get her to Lakeshore.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.892
- Hey, thanks for helping me
under there.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.241
- Anytime.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.390
- You see,
"International House Hunters"

07:14.434 --> 07:15.870
is the fancier version
of House Hunters.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.132
Those are the only two
in the franchise so far,

07:17.175 --> 07:18.350
but I think they should
do another one.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.135
Check it out: Farm Hunters.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.050
People never talk about it
on TV,

07:22.093 --> 07:24.879
but agriculture makes up over
40% of the land in the USA.

07:24.922 --> 07:27.359
I think--what's that?

07:29.274 --> 07:31.712
Oh, the bus driver's tag
said "Anita" on it.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.062
- She was taking almost
a dozen prescriptions.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.629
- That's probably why
she made the card.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.282
In case she was incapacitated,

07:37.326 --> 07:38.675
she wanted us to know what
she's on so we don't push--

07:38.719 --> 07:40.547
- Blood pressure meds,
arthritis meds,

07:40.590 --> 07:42.070
multiple antidepressant meds,

07:42.113 --> 07:44.028
and not one seizure medication.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.987
No, this--this doesn't add up.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.292
- She's got the doctor's name
on it.

07:49.381 --> 07:52.123
- Excuse me, uh, we just found
a medical card

07:52.167 --> 07:53.560
that belongs to the woman
we just brought in.

07:53.603 --> 07:54.822
- Great, I'll get it to--

07:54.865 --> 07:57.041
- I don't know who
this Dr. Shaw is,

07:57.085 --> 07:59.653
but clearly he isn't paying
attention to his patients.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.350
This list is dangerous

08:01.393 --> 08:03.308
without any anti-seizure
medication to balance her out.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.006
She just drove into
a bus shelter today

08:05.049 --> 08:07.661
and has a great case
for medical negligence.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.401
Maybe you should alert him.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.404
What?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.194
- So according to
the competition's website,

08:19.237 --> 08:21.718
there are two components
to this: the presentation--

08:21.762 --> 08:23.546
- Well, no problem there.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.157
Tuesday's the cutest thing
to ever hit the CFD.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.420
- And then there's
the performance portion.

08:28.464 --> 08:29.944
Commands, tricks,

08:29.987 --> 08:33.208
things to amuse and enhance
fire safety demonstrations.

08:33.251 --> 08:36.298
- This is what
I've been trying to tell Kidd.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.952
She isn't exactly
the best listener.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.954
- It's all under control.

08:39.997 --> 08:44.088
One of Trudy's best friends,
Denise, is a dog trainer.

08:44.132 --> 08:47.701
- Wait a minute,
doesn't Denise hate you?

08:47.744 --> 08:50.225
- We see the world differently.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.706
However,
this is right up her alley

08:52.749 --> 08:55.622
and if it makes me look good
in Trudy's eyes to hire her,

08:55.665 --> 08:57.667
well, two birds, one stone.

08:57.711 --> 09:00.322
Uh, don't you think you ought
to run this by Kidd first?

09:00.365 --> 09:03.499
- I think Kidd is gonna be
happy we took the initiative.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.458
- Mm...

09:28.132 --> 09:30.874
- This is tougher than
I thought it was gonna be.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.536
- We are never gonna
be able to work together

09:40.580 --> 09:43.495
if we cannot put this
behind us, Kelly.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.938
- Yeah, I agree.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.693
- So I've been throwing
something together.

10:06.736 --> 10:09.739
A little spreadsheet action on
some places around your area.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.436
- Wow,
you're not messing around.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.135
- Now what you're gonna wanna
look for is a big backyard

10:14.178 --> 10:17.268
for grilling/entertaining,
hardwood floors,

10:17.312 --> 10:19.488
two bedroom
plus a home office, maybe?

10:19.531 --> 10:21.055
- Brett.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.796
You really know how to pick
a partner, don't you?

10:22.839 --> 10:24.667
- Uh, I don't--

10:24.711 --> 10:26.974
- Get Emily Foster and meet me
in the briefing room now.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.372
- I-I don't blame him
for filing a complaint.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.374
Jim Shaw is a respected doctor
at Lakeshore

10:36.418 --> 10:38.812
and you accuse him of medical
negligence to a duty nurse?

10:38.855 --> 10:41.249
- Chief Hatcher, in my defense,
I know exactly what--

10:41.292 --> 10:44.078
- I know all about your medical
background, it's irrelevant.

10:44.121 --> 10:47.255
It gives you no right
to disparage actual doctors.

10:47.298 --> 10:50.084
The CFD won't stand for this
so let me be clear,

10:50.127 --> 10:53.174
if this happens again,
you won't be a paramedic.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.567
Not here, not anywhere.

10:56.830 --> 11:00.224
- Chief, it took me months
to find the right fit for 61.

11:00.268 --> 11:01.922
Foster's a talented paramedic.
She's--

11:01.965 --> 11:04.794
- You're supposed to be
the leader here.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.455
I'm sorry.
- No, I'm used to it.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.978
My old partner
used to lock horns

11:15.022 --> 11:16.197
with Hatcher all the time.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.938
You could set your watch
by it.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.417
- How'd that work out?

11:21.202 --> 11:22.420
- He, uh, he invited her

11:22.464 --> 11:24.858
to lead a task force
in Puerto Rico.

11:28.426 --> 11:30.167
- Okay.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.909
How would you describe your
relationship with your dog?

11:32.953 --> 11:34.563
- Friendly.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.521
- Really terrific.
- Yeah, she's a sweetheart.

11:36.565 --> 11:37.914
- Wrong!

11:37.958 --> 11:39.916
Dogs aren't your friends,
they aren't your children,

11:39.960 --> 11:41.483
they aren't your sweethearts.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.354
They are animals,

11:43.398 --> 11:46.923
and they are looking
for any sign of weakness

11:46.967 --> 11:48.751
in your voice,
in your demeanor,

11:48.795 --> 11:52.842
in your body language
to take advantage of.

11:52.886 --> 11:55.149
Dominance is the key.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.064
Firm leash corrections,

11:57.107 --> 11:59.849
bitter apple spray,
you know it.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.069
Negative reinforcement.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.940
They are not supposed to--
- Excuse me.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.422
- Uh, Kidd, this is Denise,

12:07.465 --> 12:09.076
she's the professional
dog trainer

12:09.119 --> 12:10.120
I was telling you about.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.296
Very close friends with Trudy.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.342
- Uh-huh, yeah.
Nice to meet you, Denise.

12:14.385 --> 12:17.171
Uh, exactly how firm
of a tug

12:17.214 --> 12:19.521
are we talking about with
this leash correction thing?

12:19.564 --> 12:22.393
- Oh, boy.
- Well, here. I'll show you.

12:25.396 --> 12:27.659
Here we go.
- Uh-huh.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.271
- Okay?

12:31.794 --> 12:33.143
- Thank you for stopping by,

12:33.187 --> 12:36.059
uh, I think we got
it from here, Denise.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.713
- Excuse me?
- You're fired.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.497
- Oh, let's not be rash.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.848
- Oh, we're beyond rash.
Get out of here, Denise.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.464
Hey, don't worry, girl.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.205
She's not gonna scare you
like that again, okay?

12:51.248 --> 12:53.120
- Look, uh, see I--I had--

12:53.163 --> 12:56.253
- I will be training this
sweet animal from now on

12:56.297 --> 12:58.212
and if see
negative reinforcement again,

12:58.255 --> 13:01.650
you will be riding to calls
on the outsides of your rigs.

13:01.693 --> 13:04.479
-  That sounds like
negative reinforcement.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.963
- Hey Brett,
thanks for this.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.529
- Happy to do it.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.489
- What was that about?

13:14.532 --> 13:16.839
- She's gonna help me
find a new place.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.232
- There's no rush to move out.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.668
- Fish and houseguests.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.017
- Oh no, it's fine.

13:21.061 --> 13:22.671
Seriously, it's been nice
having you around.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.020
- You're barely there.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.979
You go from shift to the boat
and back to shift.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.111
- Ah, idle hands.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.288
- Well, look,
if you want a cigar

13:31.332 --> 13:34.901
and chat about anything,
I'm there.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.991
- Okay, maybe.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.775
We'll see.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.996
Okay, Riley, next we're gonna
do what's called wet sanding.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.824
Have you heard of that?

13:44.867 --> 13:46.042
- No.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.001
- All right,
this is a hand sander.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.002
See the bucket?

13:49.045 --> 13:50.655
- Mm-hmm.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.005
- We pre-soak the paper

13:52.048 --> 13:55.269
because we got to keep
the hull wet while we work.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.010
Okay, grab that sponge.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.576
We'll wipe off
the excess water.

14:03.233 --> 14:04.713
- Can I ask you a question?

14:04.756 --> 14:06.193
- Yup.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.152
- Do you like my dad?

14:10.414 --> 14:12.199
- Why?

14:13.896 --> 14:15.637
- He's never here.

14:17.639 --> 14:20.076
- Yeah, well,
I'm sure he's busy.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.773
- With Mandy.

14:23.384 --> 14:26.387
- Where's your mom?

14:26.430 --> 14:28.824
- I don't remember her.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.654
- Kid, I don't know
what to tell you.

14:32.697 --> 14:35.048
You got some pretty tough cards
dealt your way.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.964
I know exactly how that feels.

14:38.007 --> 14:40.096
- What do you do about it?

14:43.099 --> 14:45.145
- I'm still figuring that out

14:45.188 --> 14:46.798
but I'll let you know
when I do.

14:49.410 --> 14:52.152
Riley, driver's here. Grab your
book bag and let's go.

15:01.944 --> 15:05.252
You think it's okay
to talk to my son that way?

15:05.295 --> 15:06.383
- Excuse me?

15:06.427 --> 15:08.820
- I hired you to restore
a boat.

15:08.864 --> 15:09.952
If I needed a child counselor,

15:09.996 --> 15:12.085
I'd have a damn professional
do it.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.956
Okay?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.089
- Dad!

15:16.132 --> 15:18.091
Terrell says he needs money.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.323
- Latte with skim milk, please.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.542
- Two of those.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.022
- Okay, I have one for you.

15:36.065 --> 15:37.806
If you could have dinner
with anyone in the world,

15:37.849 --> 15:40.330
living or dead,
who would it be?

15:40.374 --> 15:41.679
- St. Paul.

15:41.723 --> 15:44.334
- Oh, right. I guess that--

15:44.378 --> 15:46.597
- No, I'm totally kidding.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.425
No, uh, Stephen King.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.992
- What, really?

15:50.036 --> 15:52.734
- Yeah, my dad used to leave
Stephen King books

15:52.777 --> 15:54.127
lying around the house.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.520
Picked up my first
one when I was 12,

15:56.564 --> 15:59.654
"Pet Sematary," and I have
been addicted ever since.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.177
- I would not
have guessed that.

16:01.221 --> 16:04.354
- Well, stick around and you'll
find out so much more.

16:08.097 --> 16:11.405
- Hey, I have an idea.
- Yeah?

16:11.448 --> 16:12.928
- You up for a detour?

16:16.410 --> 16:18.629
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.240
- Welcome.
- Oh, we're just looking.

16:20.283 --> 16:22.503
- Of course,
make yourself at home.

16:22.546 --> 16:23.547
Have a cookie.

16:23.591 --> 16:25.158
- Hmm.
- And, um...

16:25.201 --> 16:27.377
there's a gym in the building
for your husband.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.858
- Oh no, we're not--
- Yeah, we're just--

16:29.901 --> 16:31.729
- Okay, I'll let you guys
look around.

16:31.773 --> 16:34.167
- Okay.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.385
- Wow.

16:36.778 --> 16:40.434
Wow, this is an amazing view.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.479
- So what do you think?

16:42.523 --> 16:43.915
- Countertops are nice,

16:43.959 --> 16:45.917
oh, I'd change
those fixtures, though.

16:45.961 --> 16:49.051
Great lighting,
beautiful hardwood floors,

16:49.095 --> 16:51.749
good storage
but for the asking price,

16:51.793 --> 16:54.013
this feels like a steal.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.063
What was that for?

17:01.107 --> 17:03.587
- You just looked all cute
there house hunting.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.024
It's for Casey.

17:05.067 --> 17:08.070
- I know, but the live version

17:08.114 --> 17:11.291
is just way better than
watching it on HGTV.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.685
- Well, if there's a walk-in
closet in the master,

17:14.729 --> 17:16.948
you're gonna see a side of me
that might get embarrassing.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.169
- How are you guys doing?

17:21.257 --> 17:22.867
- Great.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.482
- Excuse me, nurse?

17:28.525 --> 17:32.181
Hi, can you tell me where
I can find Doctor Jim Shaw?

17:32.225 --> 17:35.619
- Oh, sorry.
He isn't on call today.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.839
- Got it, thank you.

17:41.495 --> 17:44.498
What about the room of
a patient named Anita Grant?

17:48.067 --> 17:51.287
- That's so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.159
- Just wanted to get you
a little something

17:53.202 --> 17:56.118
and check on you and see how
you've been since the accident.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.468
- I still don't remember much.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.340
One second I was looking
in my side view

18:00.383 --> 18:04.692
because some lady in a pickup
was crowding me and...

18:04.735 --> 18:06.476
then I felt weird,

18:06.520 --> 18:11.133
like I was having goosebumps
up and down my side.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.135
Next thing I know,
I'm looking at you guys.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.224
- You look a lot better now,
let me tell you.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.008
- How were the people
at the bus stop?

18:17.052 --> 18:19.402
I-I feel terrible.

18:19.446 --> 18:23.319
- All on the mend,
not one permanent injury.

18:23.363 --> 18:26.540
Thank the good Lord for that.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.414
- Anita,
can I ask you something?

18:31.458 --> 18:34.504
Your doctor, did he talk
to you about your medication?

18:36.158 --> 18:38.508
- No, I don't think so.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.687
- Um...

18:43.731 --> 18:45.211
I saw your medical card.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.038
Oh good,
that's exactly why I made it.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.953
- Yes, uh, but...

18:50.564 --> 18:53.219
Look,
I don't mean to alarm you,

18:53.262 --> 18:55.830
but if your doctor
is prescribing

18:55.873 --> 18:57.788
all those medicines together,

18:57.832 --> 19:00.095
my opinion is...

19:01.357 --> 19:03.968
My opinion is you need
to find a new doctor.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.204
- Hey!

19:23.249 --> 19:25.599
Took a look at the boat
this morning.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.427
- Yeah?

19:27.470 --> 19:29.690
- Let's just say I'm
not happy with the work.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.084
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.043
Not sure what you were doing.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.740
The sanding's uneven,

19:36.784 --> 19:38.220
the varnish looks like it
was thrown up there

19:38.264 --> 19:39.787
with a spray can.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.832
Yeah, maybe you're just not
used to high-end jobs.

19:41.876 --> 19:45.793
I get it, you work down-market.
It's--it's my mistake.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.577
All I can say is, um,

19:47.621 --> 19:49.013
I hope you're better
at fighting fires

19:49.057 --> 19:50.101
than restoring boats.

19:50.145 --> 19:51.407
- Watch yourself.
- Dad!

19:51.451 --> 19:54.280
- No, Riley,
it's good you see this.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.630
This is how
you handle business.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.067
Recognize a bad hire,

19:59.110 --> 20:01.243
make a change as soon
as you can.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.114
You can keep the deposit.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.638
Anything more, I'm not paying.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.859
- You know what?

20:08.903 --> 20:10.296
I don't want your money.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.966
- Sorry about cluttering up
your place

20:29.010 --> 20:30.664
with all this
smoke-filled junk.

20:30.707 --> 20:34.972
- Yeah, I was gonna say
there needs to be some rules.

20:37.061 --> 20:39.063
- Oh, ha-ha.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.195
- You got a to-go mug in there?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.415
- No.
- All right.

20:44.112 --> 20:48.682
Then... you get the one
that Shay gave me.

20:53.643 --> 20:55.819
Hey, after shift, what say
you and me drive to Detroit

20:55.863 --> 20:58.169
and catch the Hawks-Red Wings?

20:58.213 --> 21:00.171
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:00.215 --> 21:02.261
- What about the boat?

21:02.304 --> 21:04.567
- Eh, owner turned into a
jackass.

21:04.611 --> 21:07.701
Went right into
the "life's too short" column.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.877
Anyway, kind of glad
to be done with it.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.661
Frees me up
for more hang time.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.405
- Great.

21:16.449 --> 21:19.103
- Sexy pants.
- Thanks.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.718
- It's open!

21:24.761 --> 21:28.722
- Hey, Cindy made a batch of
these muffins you rave about.

21:28.765 --> 21:31.638
I told her, you know,
I'd look at them and,

21:31.681 --> 21:34.293
they'd all be gone, so.

21:34.336 --> 21:37.165
- She make them on her own or
you ask her to make them?

21:37.208 --> 21:40.081
- Nah, she just--you...

21:41.778 --> 21:43.737
I mean, I-I--
I might've suggested.

21:43.780 --> 21:48.307
- Herrmann, will you please
stop fussing over me?

21:48.350 --> 21:51.092
Okay? Seriously, I'm fine.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.095
Hey whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

21:54.138 --> 21:57.011
Hey, hey, about face,
you can leave the muffins.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.232
Thank you.

22:03.452 --> 22:05.802
- Hey, what's this?

22:06.629 --> 22:08.283
- Uh, a dog training bible.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.894
That has got all the secrets
on how to transform Tuesday

22:10.938 --> 22:12.766
into the perfect show dog.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.595
- You're really taking this
competition seriously, huh?

22:15.638 --> 22:18.467
- Well, fire safety is
serious business.

22:18.511 --> 22:21.383
- Or you might say that you're
throwing yourself into this

22:21.427 --> 22:24.343
because you don't wanna deal
with the Severide of it all.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.350
All right, um,
eat your muffins.

22:31.393 --> 22:34.091
I'm gonna go knock the ice off
the windshield

22:34.135 --> 22:35.658
and meet you in the truck.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.007
Gimme ten minutes.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.966
- All right.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.144
- Yeah.

22:52.545 --> 22:53.850
- Just the guy
I was looking for.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.461
Wait till you see the selects
I came up with

22:55.504 --> 22:56.679
while we were off shift.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.072
All right,
this one's in Hyde Park.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.640
Three bedroom, top floor,
parking's included.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.163
I may have popped over there

23:02.206 --> 23:04.208
and it's not ready to move in
yet, but it's pretty nice.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.908
- I'm not really a fan
of big windows.

23:07.951 --> 23:10.476
- Oh, yeah, no,
totally get it.

23:10.519 --> 23:12.608
Um, this one used to be
a school

23:12.652 --> 23:14.828
that was converted
into residential condos.

23:14.871 --> 23:16.438
And again, I might've done
a little drive-by

23:16.482 --> 23:17.570
and it is nice!

23:17.613 --> 23:20.268
- Hmm, shower's a little small.

23:20.311 --> 23:22.096
- Huh.
- Right?

23:22.139 --> 23:25.229
- Oh, I mean, I guess--
I guess it's average.

23:25.273 --> 23:26.709
I didn't really...

23:26.753 --> 23:28.102
Okay, how about this one?

23:28.145 --> 23:30.713
It has a fireplace
and it's in Millennium Park.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.979
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

23:36.023 --> 23:39.200
- Yeah, yeah, uh, send me
the details and I'll fly by.

23:39.243 --> 23:41.768
- Absolutely. Thanks.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.465
- Whoops.
- Hey, Captain.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.902
I must've left half a dozen
messages for Doctor Shaw

23:45.946 --> 23:47.469
and I still haven't heard back.

23:47.513 --> 23:48.731
- Oh, I'm sure it's just--

23:48.775 --> 23:50.472
- Could we maybe
swing by Lakeshore?

23:50.516 --> 23:52.561
If he's not taking my calls,
then I need to get in his face

23:52.605 --> 23:54.694
and make him see
where I'm coming from.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.218
Um, respectfully, of course.

23:57.261 --> 24:00.787
I'll just explain, not accuse.
Thanks for this.

24:00.830 --> 24:03.267
It'll work out, you'll see.

24:05.922 --> 24:09.404
- No, no, no, no, no. Here.
Come over here.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.756
Tuesday, come.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.367
Good girl, and sit?

24:20.241 --> 24:22.896
Sit.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.506
Sit.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.073
Will you sit, please?

24:29.729 --> 24:32.079
- Want to walk with me
and inspect the rigs?

24:34.777 --> 24:36.257
- Yeah, sure.

24:39.390 --> 24:42.393
- Hey, hey, hey.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.613
Now we're gonna try drop.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.528
Okay, Tuesday?

24:46.572 --> 24:47.921
Hey, come here.

24:47.964 --> 24:51.664
Okay, can you drop for me?
Drop!

24:51.707 --> 24:55.276
Drop? No, Tuesday. Drop down.

24:55.319 --> 24:56.930
- What are the odds
of getting Denise back?

24:56.973 --> 24:59.019
- Drop for me, Tuesday!

24:59.062 --> 25:01.151
Come on, Tu--

25:02.936 --> 25:05.286
You know, maybe it's the treats
that I'm giving her.

25:05.329 --> 25:08.028
You know, the "Dog Bible" says
that they should be high value.

25:08.071 --> 25:09.333
Maybe these aren't cutting it.

25:09.377 --> 25:12.293
- What's high value mean?
She's a dog.

25:12.336 --> 25:13.642
She'll eat anything.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.514
- Yeah, but when I try
to give her medication,

25:15.557 --> 25:18.647
she wouldn't take it unless
I slather it in peanut butter.

25:19.779 --> 25:21.258
- Promising.

25:21.302 --> 25:22.651
- No, I'm telling you.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.653
Like, she'd eat a rock
if I put peanut butter on it.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.133
Won't you?

25:26.176 --> 25:28.614
- Madame.
- Oh, why thank you.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.529
All right.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.574
Tuesday.

25:32.618 --> 25:33.923
Stop.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.014
Drop!

25:39.538 --> 25:40.974
And roll!

25:41.017 --> 25:43.411
- Oh!
- Unbelievable!

25:45.500 --> 25:46.632
- What'd I tell ya?

25:46.675 --> 25:48.547
- We might actually win
this thing.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.723
- That work on kids too?

25:51.898 --> 25:54.117
- Oh!
- Way to go, kid.

25:54.161 --> 25:55.423
- Good job.

25:57.425 --> 25:58.600
- Foster?

25:58.644 --> 26:00.210
- I know,
I'm just here to explain.

26:02.212 --> 26:04.432
Doctor Shaw?
- You're looking at him.

26:04.475 --> 26:05.781
- I'm Emily Foster,

26:05.825 --> 26:08.218
the paramedic you snitched out
to my chief.

26:08.262 --> 26:09.524
- Excuse me?

26:09.568 --> 26:12.048
Anita Grant, bus driver,
does that ring a bell?

26:12.092 --> 26:13.572
- I have no idea what
you're talking--

26:13.615 --> 26:15.835
- Your patient was dangerously
overmedicated.

26:15.878 --> 26:18.272
That woman trusts you,
you were her doctor.

26:18.315 --> 26:19.621
You were supposed
to put her health

26:19.665 --> 26:21.014
and her care
first and foremost.

26:21.057 --> 26:22.363
Not pump her so full of drugs

26:22.406 --> 26:23.930
that she has a seizure
while driving.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.845
She deserves better
and that's on you.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.371
- Ambulance 61, Truck 81,
Engine 51, Squad 3...

26:30.414 --> 26:31.894
- Report me again,
I don't care.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.548
What you're doing is not right.

26:33.592 --> 26:37.639
- Structure fire
at 3386 North Tahoma Avenue.

26:38.727 --> 26:40.511
- Hey, that's Boyd's place!

26:40.555 --> 26:42.862
- Who?
- The boat I've been restoring.

26:42.905 --> 26:45.255
That's his address.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.057
- Severide,
how many live here?

27:04.100 --> 27:06.799
- Father and son, son's ten.
They have a boat in the garage.

27:06.842 --> 27:09.018
- Get in there and do
a primary search.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.890
- Copy that.
- Hurry, get a line in there!

27:10.933 --> 27:12.587
- Copy that, Chief!

27:12.631 --> 27:13.893
- Casey!
- Yup.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.982
- Clear the house.
- 81, let's go.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.595
- Check every square inch!

27:20.639 --> 27:21.988
- Copy!

27:23.685 --> 27:24.947
- Riley!

27:29.822 --> 27:32.259
Riley!

27:32.302 --> 27:34.261
Anyone here?

27:39.222 --> 27:40.876
Riley!

27:43.792 --> 27:44.880
- Get down!

27:56.762 --> 28:00.504
- Let's keep looking.
Come on.

28:08.425 --> 28:09.862
- The house is clear.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.559
- What is this?
- Oh, my God.

28:11.602 --> 28:12.865
- You the homeowner?

28:12.908 --> 28:14.562
- Yeah.
- You know where your son is?

28:14.605 --> 28:16.607
- Yeah, he's at school.
How--how did this happen?

28:16.651 --> 28:18.740
All occupants accounted for.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.524
Severide, Cruz, evacuate.

28:20.568 --> 28:21.743
- Copy that.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.179
Herrmann,
let's get this fire out.

28:23.223 --> 28:27.314
- Severide. Did you--
did you say Kelly Severide?

28:27.357 --> 28:28.576
You did this!
- Hey, hey!

28:28.619 --> 28:29.795
- You did this!
- Hey!

28:29.838 --> 28:31.579
- This son of a bitch
lit up my boat!

28:31.622 --> 28:33.755
He did this!
You're going to jail, asshole.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.148
- Look, I don't know what
you're trying to pull.

28:35.191 --> 28:36.453
Back the hell up.

28:36.497 --> 28:39.239
- Enough!
Casey, get him out of here.

28:39.282 --> 28:42.068
- Come on, back up.

28:42.111 --> 28:45.071
- You, over there
until I tell you otherwise.

28:48.814 --> 28:49.902
- Fire's out, Chief.

28:49.945 --> 28:51.730
- Copy that.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.166
- Good, the cops are here.

28:53.209 --> 28:56.125
Hey, I'm the homeowner.
I know who did this.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.431
He's right there.

28:57.474 --> 28:59.259
He started the fire!

28:59.302 --> 29:00.564
That man right there.

29:06.222 --> 29:09.617
- How long are they gonna keep
grilling me, Chief?

29:09.660 --> 29:11.837
There's a third detective here
asking me more questions.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.927
- The truth is on your side,
Kelly, don't forget that.

29:14.970 --> 29:17.059
Doesn't matter how many people
you have to tell.

29:17.103 --> 29:18.234
- You know what I think?

29:18.278 --> 29:19.801
I think the boy lit
his own boat on fire.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.324
I think he wanted
this reaction.

29:24.066 --> 29:26.286
He's already come after me
in front of his son,

29:26.329 --> 29:27.940
made a show of it.
That's not enough?

29:27.983 --> 29:29.680
- Kelly.

29:33.423 --> 29:35.948
Come on.

29:49.744 --> 29:51.964
- This is beyond.

29:52.007 --> 29:55.576
- So you weren't upset
with Boyd for firing you?

29:55.619 --> 29:57.273
That's a lot of money.

29:57.317 --> 29:58.448
- Like I told
the first officer,

29:58.492 --> 30:00.146
the second, and now you,

30:00.189 --> 30:01.669
I've been on shift all day.

30:01.712 --> 30:03.366
Ask 30 people here
who've seen me.

30:05.934 --> 30:09.111
- Boss.
- Tom, thanks for coming.

30:09.155 --> 30:11.853
- I'm Captain Van Meter,
Office of Fire Investigation.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.594
- Detective Johnson,
Major Crimes.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.291
Did you find evidence of arson?

30:15.335 --> 30:17.424
- Uh, the source of the fire
was a pile of rags

30:17.467 --> 30:18.991
soaked in oil-based wood
stain

30:19.034 --> 30:22.298
which makes a perfect setup
for spontaneous combustion.

30:22.342 --> 30:23.517
- Meaning?

30:23.560 --> 30:24.910
- The oil stain cures

30:24.953 --> 30:26.999
and has nowhere to off gas
within the pile of rags,

30:27.042 --> 30:30.524
so it generates its own heat
and fwoom.

30:30.567 --> 30:31.917
- How long would it take

30:31.960 --> 30:33.701
for this spontaneous combustion
to occur?

30:33.744 --> 30:36.617
- Anywhere from a few minutes
to a few hours.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.227
- So theoretically,

30:38.271 --> 30:39.968
someone could have planted the
pile of rags in the morning,

30:40.012 --> 30:42.928
headed off to shift,
and waited for the inevitable.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.197
- I didn't leave any rags out.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.381
- You all right?
- Yeah.

31:01.424 --> 31:02.686
- What happened?

31:02.730 --> 31:04.514
- They told me to get a lawyer.

31:04.558 --> 31:05.559
- That's unacceptable.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.604
- You want me to call someone?

31:07.648 --> 31:10.129
- I'm thinking it won't
be necessary.

31:21.053 --> 31:24.317
- Well, nice working with you,
Brett.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.321
- I just heard from
Doctor Shaw.

31:28.364 --> 31:29.844
- About that--

31:29.888 --> 31:31.367
- Informed me that you caught
a prescription error

31:31.411 --> 31:34.414
that the hospital made
with one of his patients.

31:34.457 --> 31:36.285
May well have saved her life.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.809
No one else caught the fact
that she was overmedicated.

31:41.073 --> 31:44.076
- I take a hard line, but I can
admit when I made a mistake

31:44.119 --> 31:46.295
and clearly I owe you
an apology.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.559
- Uh, I don't--
I mean, you don't have--

31:49.603 --> 31:51.779
- No, I do, and I'm sorry.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.785
Brett.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.311
- What just happened?

32:02.355 --> 32:05.140
- You kicked ass,
that's what happened.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.144
- Excuse me, um...

32:10.319 --> 32:11.755
Is Kelly here?

32:25.595 --> 32:27.946
I started the fire.

32:30.078 --> 32:31.862
- I know.

32:44.571 --> 32:46.790
- How did you know?

32:46.834 --> 32:49.489
- I've told you a dozen times
how dangerous it is

32:49.532 --> 32:51.882
to leave oily rags
lying around,

32:51.926 --> 32:53.580
how flammable they are,

32:53.623 --> 32:56.626
and I've never once
seen you leave them out.

33:02.284 --> 33:04.547
- I hate him.

33:16.429 --> 33:19.214
Here, let's grab a seat.

33:33.228 --> 33:36.579
The way he acts towards you,

33:36.623 --> 33:39.408
towards everyone,
that's his problem.

33:39.452 --> 33:41.323
It's not your problem.

33:42.629 --> 33:45.458
What is your problem is
how you respond to it.

33:47.199 --> 33:48.461
And like I told you before,

33:48.504 --> 33:50.593
I didn't have that part
figured out.

33:50.637 --> 33:52.117
I don't.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.337
But I do know
this isn't the way

33:55.381 --> 33:56.991
and I know it's not you.

34:00.386 --> 34:02.866
The good news is
no one got hurt.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.869
Hey, we got lucky.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.960
Oh, gosh.

34:10.004 --> 34:12.789
- Riley, look at me.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.140
We got lucky,

34:15.183 --> 34:17.185
but going forward
isn't about luck.

34:17.229 --> 34:21.711
It isn't about your old man
or how he acts, it's about you.

34:21.755 --> 34:24.453
It's how about you decide
to respond.

34:26.412 --> 34:28.544
Choose to be better than him.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.809
- Okay.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.637
- Good man.

34:37.858 --> 34:40.165
Now we have something
really hard we have to do.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.211
I did.

34:44.734 --> 34:46.127
I told my dad.

34:58.748 --> 35:00.750
- We're gonna get him
counseling.

35:00.794 --> 35:02.143
I assure you.

35:06.278 --> 35:07.888
- You choose.

35:18.246 --> 35:19.943
- Riley, get in the car.

35:21.858 --> 35:23.817
Riley!

35:44.054 --> 35:45.404
- You coming out tonight?

35:45.447 --> 35:46.970
- First, I think I need
to swing by Lakeshore,

35:47.014 --> 35:49.843
toss a couple of "my bads"
at the doctor I lit up.

35:49.886 --> 35:51.366
- Smart.

35:58.330 --> 36:01.855
- Could we try this again?
- Yeah.

36:01.898 --> 36:05.772
- Emily Foster.
- Jim Shaw, pleasure.

36:07.252 --> 36:10.298
You know, just so you know,
I do care about my patients.

36:10.342 --> 36:11.995
- I'm confused,

36:12.039 --> 36:14.737
why did you rat me out to
the chief in the first place?

36:14.781 --> 36:16.565
- I didn't, my ER nurse
made the call

36:16.609 --> 36:18.567
after you gave her
Anita's medical card.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.090
Apparently, you had some
pretty choice words to say

36:20.134 --> 36:23.311
about me after you thought
I was her primary caregiver.

36:23.355 --> 36:24.791
- Me? No.
I mean, okay, guilty.

36:24.834 --> 36:27.141
Okay, not a big deal.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.796
No, nurses get protective.

36:29.839 --> 36:32.015
You know, Anita Grant had seen
five different doctors

36:32.059 --> 36:33.408
in the last eight months.

36:33.452 --> 36:35.236
Clearly, none of them bothered
to look at her card,

36:35.280 --> 36:36.846
but the reason my name was
there

36:36.890 --> 36:39.719
was that I was the first
physician she saw.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.938
I would never prescribe someone
that many medications.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.897
- Oh.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.420
I--

36:45.464 --> 36:48.336
- Honestly, I'm--I'm grateful
that you caught the mistake.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.774
And a little impressed.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.428
There are not a whole lot
of paramedics

36:53.472 --> 36:55.430
that pay that much attention.

36:55.474 --> 36:57.519
- That's kind of my thing.

36:57.563 --> 36:59.608
- I can see that.

36:59.652 --> 37:03.656
- Anyway, I apologize
for coming at you.

37:04.831 --> 37:07.312
I will check first before
I bring both barrels.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.444
- Not a problem, I understand.

37:11.185 --> 37:13.535
Hey wait, um,

37:13.579 --> 37:15.407
I got a question for ya, um...

37:19.019 --> 37:23.850
All right... would you like
to get dinner sometime?

37:29.856 --> 37:32.989
- And what do we do when
we hear this howl?

37:33.033 --> 37:35.122
all: Get out of the house!

37:36.863 --> 37:39.953
- All right, next up we have
Tuesday the Dalmatian

37:39.996 --> 37:42.303
from Firehouse 51.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.872
- Okay, you're with me.

37:51.399 --> 37:52.661
- All right.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.839
Okay, all right.

37:56.883 --> 37:58.058
Stay.

37:59.799 --> 38:01.409
Stop!

38:01.453 --> 38:03.281
Good girl. Drop.

38:05.370 --> 38:06.371
Drop.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.636
- Go, down.

38:10.679 --> 38:13.378
Okay, just--come on.

38:18.470 --> 38:19.862
- Tuesday, Tuesday!

38:19.906 --> 38:21.037
- No! No!

38:21.081 --> 38:22.387
- Oh, my God! No!

38:27.566 --> 38:29.394
- That dog is mauling the girl!

38:31.918 --> 38:33.354
- No, no, no!

38:33.398 --> 38:35.182
- The dog is not--
the dog is not

38:35.225 --> 38:37.445
mauling the girl.

38:37.489 --> 38:39.882
- Tuesday!

38:45.627 --> 38:48.456
- Tomorrow night--
- Mm, let me guess.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.328
"Property Brothers" marathon.

38:50.371 --> 38:51.372
- Ha-ha. No.

38:53.592 --> 38:55.071
- What's this?

38:55.115 --> 38:57.117
- Stephen King is speaking
at Northwestern.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.684
- No way.

38:58.727 --> 39:00.599
- If you bring a book,
he will sign it.

39:01.948 --> 39:04.864
- Marry me.

39:04.907 --> 39:06.431
- I didn't mean--
that--that was, uh--

39:06.474 --> 39:07.606
that was, uh--

39:07.649 --> 39:09.390
- No, I know.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.479
- I'm gonna go get you
another bottle.

39:17.529 --> 39:22.142
- Brett, that house in
Millennium Park, uh--

39:22.185 --> 39:23.491
- What?

39:23.535 --> 39:25.058
- The house you sent me
to look at.

39:25.101 --> 39:27.103
I don't think
it's going to work out.

39:27.147 --> 39:29.497
- Really? I thought it had
everything you wanted.

39:29.541 --> 39:30.977
- It--it's not the house,

39:31.020 --> 39:35.634
uh, I think I'm gonna stay
with Severide for a while.

39:35.677 --> 39:36.939
He'd never admit it, but he--

39:36.983 --> 39:38.724
he needs someone looking
after him.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.255
- As a fellow parent,

39:48.298 --> 39:49.735
if I saw some strange dog

39:49.778 --> 39:52.825
trying to lick
my kid's face off,

39:52.868 --> 39:54.914
I'd be a little pissed too.

39:54.957 --> 39:58.004
- Yeah, yeah, I might've
gotten a little too into that.

39:59.266 --> 40:02.356
- Hey, you know you keep
telling me that

40:02.400 --> 40:03.879
you're fine and I hear ya.

40:03.923 --> 40:06.360
Everybody deals
with breakups differently

40:06.404 --> 40:09.102
but if you're not totally fine

40:09.145 --> 40:12.453
and you're just trying to find
your way through it,

40:12.497 --> 40:14.368
hey...

40:14.412 --> 40:15.891
it's okay too.

40:17.632 --> 40:20.592
Doesn't make you
any less badass.

40:24.030 --> 40:29.818
- Okay. So maybe I'm not
completely over it.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.864
Yet.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.476
But I will be.

40:35.520 --> 40:39.001
- Yeah.
