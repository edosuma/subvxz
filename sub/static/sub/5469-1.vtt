WEBVTT

00:03.971 --> 00:08.109
(drumroll)

00:08.176 --> 00:11.145
(rousing orchestral
fanfare playing)

00:21.055 --> 00:23.424
(fanfare ends)

00:31.832 --> 00:34.768
(gentle acoustic
melody playing)

00:50.884 --> 00:52.086
* A-hey *

00:52.153 --> 00:56.190
* Yeah, yeah *

00:56.257 --> 00:58.092
* A-hey *

00:58.159 --> 01:01.129
* Yeah, yeah *

01:01.195 --> 01:04.532
* Yeah... *

01:04.598 --> 01:06.300
BRENDA:
Honey, you got the baby?

01:06.367 --> 01:10.003
* I don't know why I love you *

01:10.070 --> 01:11.405
RICHARD:
Yeah, yeah, I got the...

01:11.472 --> 01:12.940
I'll get the baby.
I thought you had him.

01:13.006 --> 01:13.974
(baby crying)

01:14.041 --> 01:16.910
* Why I love you *

01:16.977 --> 01:20.080
* I don't know why I love you *

01:20.148 --> 01:23.417
* But I love you *

01:23.484 --> 01:25.753
(crying)
RICHARD:
Coming. Coming.

01:25.819 --> 01:26.854
Oh!

01:26.920 --> 01:29.890
* Always treat me like a fool *

01:29.957 --> 01:30.958
(crying)

01:31.024 --> 01:32.960
* Kick me when I'm down *

01:33.026 --> 01:34.595
* That's your rule *

01:36.130 --> 01:40.668
* I don't know why I love you *

01:40.734 --> 01:43.504
* But I love you *

01:43.571 --> 01:45.173
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:45.239 --> 01:46.507
RICHARD:
Daddy's got you.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.242
Daddy's got you.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.543
Where's my kiss?

01:49.610 --> 01:51.512
Come on. Come on.

01:51.579 --> 01:52.980
* On this cold, black Earth *

01:53.046 --> 01:54.515
RICHARD:
Come on. Come on.

01:54.582 --> 01:57.918
* Baby, I never knew
how much love could hurt *

01:57.985 --> 01:59.320
You're doing it wrong.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.521
What are you
talking about?

02:00.588 --> 02:01.855
You don't even know
what I'm doing.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.056
I can tell
by the cry.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.725
Come on, take Kelly.

02:04.792 --> 02:08.162
* Can't stop, I can't
stop crying, can't you see? *

02:08.229 --> 02:10.764
* Here, I'm pleading
on my knees *

02:10.830 --> 02:11.932
* I'm on my knees *

02:11.999 --> 02:13.634
Come on, take Kelly.
I got this.

02:13.701 --> 02:14.768
Go ahead.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.505
Hey, my big boy... Hi.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.574
* 'Cause I love you *

02:20.641 --> 02:23.677
* I love you, I love you, baby *

02:23.744 --> 02:28.316
* Baby, baby, please stop,
baby, baby, please stop. *

02:28.382 --> 02:29.350
BRENDA:
Aw...

02:29.417 --> 02:32.186
That's my big boy.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.521
Oh, yes...

02:33.587 --> 02:35.256
RICHARD:
Hi, I'm Richard Cooper.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.924
And that's my wife Brenda.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.661
We have two incredible
children,
Brian and Kelly.

02:40.728 --> 02:43.297
We've been married
close to seven years.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.099
My wife is beautiful,
intelligent

02:46.166 --> 02:47.235
and a great mother.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.069
It's the perfect life.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.539
There's just one problem:

02:51.605 --> 02:54.842
I'm bored
out of my fucking mind.

02:54.908 --> 02:58.512
Now, I'm sure I'd have
a much rosier outlook on life

02:58.579 --> 03:00.681
if my wife and I
actually had sex,

03:00.748 --> 03:02.950
but there always
seems to be something wrong.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.518
No, my face hurts.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.221
It's not your
birthday.

03:13.694 --> 03:18.031
We both work, we're both tired,
but that's no excuse.

03:18.098 --> 03:20.200
To be honest, I don't know

03:20.268 --> 03:21.935
how much more
of this I can take.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.938
Richard, do you think
perhaps you work too much?

03:25.005 --> 03:25.906
Oh, no, no, no.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.207
I-I work, too. I do.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.543
But I come home from work, and
I have to take care of the kids,

03:29.610 --> 03:30.978
and I have to
take care of you.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.179
And frankly,
I'm tired.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.381
I'm tired.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.349
Too tired to wear
a nice pair of panties?

03:35.416 --> 03:36.650
What's wrong
with my panties?

03:36.717 --> 03:37.751
They're huge!

03:37.818 --> 03:39.720
You know, the biggest thing
on a pair of panties

03:39.787 --> 03:40.788
should be the tag.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.756
That's all I want to see:
tag and ass.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.624
Tag and ass!

03:43.691 --> 03:45.493
BRENDA:
You see? You see?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.094
This is what
I'm talking about.
Mm-hmm.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.529
You see how
insensitive he is?

03:48.596 --> 03:50.130
You know, Brenda,
maybe I'd be more sensitive

03:50.197 --> 03:51.365
if you'd
have sex with me.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.800
It seems like the only time

03:52.866 --> 03:54.768
she wants to have sex with me
is to make a baby.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.770
The only time you want
to make a baby with me

03:56.837 --> 03:58.205
is to have sex.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.640
That doesn't
make any sense!

03:59.707 --> 04:01.108
Well, that's
because I'm tired!

04:01.174 --> 04:02.610
Now we're making progress.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.514
RICHARD:
I hated that therapist.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.216
She wasn't married
and didn't have any kids.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.718
You know,

04:10.784 --> 04:13.487
when you're on a plane,
you kind of want a pilot

04:13.554 --> 04:15.889
with more experience than you.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.558
But maybe that's just me.

04:17.625 --> 04:21.028
Now, what I can't figure out
is how can my wife

04:21.094 --> 04:24.231
not have sex with me,
and then send me out

04:24.298 --> 04:27.435
into a world with so many
beautiful women?

04:27.501 --> 04:29.202
That's like dropping me
into the ocean

04:29.269 --> 04:31.672
and expecting me to not get
wet.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.375
I mean, every single woman
that I see

04:34.442 --> 04:36.844
I have an imaginary
relationship with.

04:36.910 --> 04:37.978
Like this one.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.414
Ah, she's got beautiful lips.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.816
But if we got married,
how long would it be

04:42.883 --> 04:45.386
before I got tired
of those lips?

04:45.453 --> 04:46.687
How long would it be

04:46.754 --> 04:49.357
before those lips
called me an asshole?

04:49.423 --> 04:52.326
And look at her.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.961
What a smile.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.563
She looks happy now,

04:55.629 --> 04:57.598
but if I was married to her
for eight years,

04:57.665 --> 04:59.299
I'd just be thinking about
that phone bill.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.434
I don't know.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.870
And look at her.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.606
Look at those eyes,
those cheekbones.

05:05.673 --> 05:09.810
She's like a painting...
a painting I'd love to mount.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.423
No matter where my head is,

05:22.490 --> 05:24.925
when I get to Manhattan,
I'm fine.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.928
I love the city,
rats and all.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.763
I love my job.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.433
I'm an investment banker
at a mid-size firm.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.568
I'm one of the only blacks
at the company.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.237
As a matter of fact,
there are so few blacks here,

05:37.304 --> 05:41.041
I think I know every black
person that works for the firm.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.410
Morning, Pam.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.578
Howdy, Mr. Cooper.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.948
Morning, Ron.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.116
Good morning,
Richard.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.120
(hip-hop music playing
through headphones)

05:58.459 --> 05:59.593
(elevator bell dings)

05:59.660 --> 06:01.328
* Yo, fuck
the cracker *

06:01.395 --> 06:02.830
* That's what I say *

06:02.896 --> 06:05.733
* And fuck these bitches
that always want to play *

06:05.799 --> 06:08.536
* I'm the type of nigga
that is never gay *

06:08.602 --> 06:11.238
* If you fuck with me, I'll
put your head in cake *

06:11.304 --> 06:14.207
* If you fuck with me, I'll
shoot your moms at your wake *

06:14.274 --> 06:16.844
* If you fuck with me,
you made a big mistake. *

06:44.137 --> 06:45.405
(phone ringing)

06:45.473 --> 06:47.608
Okay.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.378
Tracy...

06:51.445 --> 06:54.181
this is what we're
doing today, all right?

06:54.247 --> 06:55.348
Seen George?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.050
I'm right here.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.218
See you later, Mary.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.921
George, your wife is on
the phone, and Veronica called.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.590
Wife? I don't want
to talk to her.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.291
Find out what she wants.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.759
Call back Veronica.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.427
Rich, you want to
go over that stuff

07:07.495 --> 07:08.562
before Landis gets in?

07:08.629 --> 07:09.663
Sure, just,
uh, take off your coat...

07:09.730 --> 07:11.264
Good morning, everyone.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.433
Cooper, how's
the Coleman account?

07:13.501 --> 07:15.102
Incredible. The
Narco funds are up.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.269
LANDIS:
All right.

07:16.336 --> 07:19.139
Let's get to work, people.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.010
(phone ringing)

07:23.076 --> 07:24.444
TRACY:
Pupkin & Langford. Please hold.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.445
Pupkin & Langford.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.781
Lunch?

07:29.483 --> 07:31.619
Well, I got to ask.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.086
Come on, you know
I hate the crowds.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.722
By the time you get your
food, you got to come back.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.057
Well, have fun all by yourself.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.793
I'm gonna get a quick bite and
then get on the Coleman account.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.329
See ya.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.131
RICHARD:
Hey, I got nothing
against George,

07:44.197 --> 07:45.766
but I just hate going to lunch

07:45.833 --> 07:48.235
at the same time
everybody else does.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.737
It's just way too crowded.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.606
Look at this mess.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.042
It's just not the New York
that I like.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.580
Now, at 2:00,
it's a different story.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.615
Things slow down.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.484
That's when I like to go out.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.787
I can eat,
or I can go shopping,

08:06.854 --> 08:08.822
or I can just clear my head.

08:08.889 --> 08:12.059
And I can also watch women
and get a good look.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.895
'Cause I know I will never
see them again.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.497
Now, you can't look
at a woman in the suburbs.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.600
You stare at a soccer mom
too long,

08:19.667 --> 08:23.170
and they'll post your name
on the Internet.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.138
(bell dings)

08:28.308 --> 08:31.144
(typing)

08:34.347 --> 08:36.015
Can I help you
find something?

08:36.082 --> 08:38.085
Just looking.

08:42.556 --> 08:43.724
Have you seen
the new Prada suits?

08:43.791 --> 08:45.959
No, that's okay, that's okay.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.530
Excuse me, sir,
would you like to try
a new fragrance today?

08:50.598 --> 08:51.531
Nah, that's okay.

08:51.599 --> 08:52.666
Oh.
(spraying)

08:52.733 --> 08:54.602
Hey! Don't spray
that shit on me.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.537
It's really good.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.810
Hi, I'm Candy.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.713
Can I help you
with something?

09:05.779 --> 09:07.314
Do you have this in blue?

09:07.380 --> 09:11.484
You know, I think you
should try this green one.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.720
Uh, I-I don't
really wear green.

09:12.786 --> 09:16.356
Okay, but this green is hot.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.357
Come on. Trust me.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.558
Let's go try it on.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.661
I'm telling you,
I don't like green.

09:21.629 --> 09:24.932
(smooth jazz tune
playing faintly)

09:26.366 --> 09:27.635
That looks great on you.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.669
You think so?

09:28.736 --> 09:30.503
Absolutely.
It's sexy.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.605
I love it.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.741
I just don't like
wearing green.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.442
Yeah, but you should
start wearing green.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.611
I mean, you look
really handsome in it.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.512
Hey, Lisa.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.214
Will you tell him
how this shirt looks.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.883
Oh, I love it
on you!

09:42.950 --> 09:44.551
I'm-I'm not just
saying that.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.220
I think it looks
great on you.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.022
(Kelly giggling)

09:49.089 --> 09:50.758
Daddy's home.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.325
BRENDA:
Daddy's home.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.593
KELLY:
Daddy!

09:53.661 --> 09:55.162
Yeah!

09:55.228 --> 09:56.429
Daddy's home.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.431
Hey, Daddy.

09:58.498 --> 09:59.432
How's it going?

09:59.499 --> 10:00.433
Pretty good.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.501
Where's Brian?

10:01.568 --> 10:03.003
Oh, he's upstairs napping.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.838
Oh, hey, I've got
all these tests to grade,

10:04.905 --> 10:06.139
so can you do
the dishes tonight?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.374
Yeah, yeah,
no problem.
Great.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.508
Hey, Kelly.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.210
Hi, Daddy.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.679
How big is Kelly?

10:11.745 --> 10:12.913
This big.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.281
RICHARD:
Yeah. Where's Kelly's ear?

10:14.347 --> 10:16.383
Here.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.618
Where's Kelly's nose?
Here.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.487
Where's Kelly's
esophagus?

10:20.553 --> 10:23.223
(Brenda laughing)

10:23.290 --> 10:25.793
Give the kid a break;
she's only three.

10:25.859 --> 10:26.994
Hey, there's white
kids that are three

10:27.060 --> 10:28.395
taking the bar
right now.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.597
W-H-I-T-E, please.

10:30.664 --> 10:31.899
Okay, okay.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.367
Hey, Kelly,
I got you.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.602
Daddy got you.
(Kelly laughing)

10:35.669 --> 10:37.570
Right upside the head.
You went shopping? Huh.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.539
Daddy got you.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.041
I thought you didn't like green.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.643
(laughing)
Figured I'd get
something new.

10:43.711 --> 10:47.147
It's different.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.515
Pretty.

10:48.581 --> 10:49.750
RICHARD:
There were days

10:49.817 --> 10:51.919
when Brenda and I
got along great.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.721
But we still weren't having
sex.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.189
When a married couple
stops having sex,

10:56.256 --> 10:57.825
at first,
they complain about it.

10:57.891 --> 11:01.061
But after a while,
they get used to it.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.430
She walks out of the shower,
you don't even look.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.400
'Cause you know there's
nothing there for you.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.836
The most dangerous time

11:08.902 --> 11:11.839
in a marriage
is when the couple accepts

11:11.905 --> 11:13.506
that they're not having sex.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.175
Speak up; I'm
in an elevator.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.310
TRACY:
Richard, there's someone here
to see you.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.279
Uh, a client?

11:19.346 --> 11:20.313
She didn't say.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.488
Nikki?

11:28.555 --> 11:31.324
RICHARD:
Wow, Nikki Tru.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.660
I haven't seen her
in eight years.

11:33.727 --> 11:34.995
She was my best friend's girl.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.664
I was crazy about her.

11:37.731 --> 11:38.866
What's wrong?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.267
You didn't think
you'd see me again?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.535
No, it's not that;
I'm just surprised.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.972
Wow, you look good, Nikki.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.940
Thanks.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.476
You know, people don't really
smoke in offices anymore.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.811
I'm not really a smoker.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.145
I'm just trying
to lose some weight.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.047
So what's that,
a diet cigarette?

11:54.114 --> 11:55.382
(chuckles)

11:55.448 --> 11:57.417
I'll put it out.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.787
You look good, Richie.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.521
That's a nice shirt.

12:01.588 --> 12:02.990
Thanks.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.993
So, wh-what brings
you around, Nikki?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.795
I was in the neighborhood,
heard you worked in the area,

12:07.861 --> 12:09.797
thought I'd stop by
and say hi.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.231
That's allowed, right?

12:11.298 --> 12:13.500
Yeah. Hi.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.068
Hi.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.038
You want to show me
your office or something?

12:18.105 --> 12:19.039
Come on.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.307
Okay.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.408
It's good to see you.

12:21.474 --> 12:22.509
Yeah, you, too.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.377
Which way?
This way.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.713
NIKKI (chuckles):
Are these your kids?

12:26.780 --> 12:28.581
Yeah, that's
my son Brian

12:28.648 --> 12:30.483
and that's
my daughter Kelly.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.252
Same mother?

12:32.319 --> 12:34.254
Same mother, my wife,
seven years.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.722
No side kids?

12:35.789 --> 12:36.790
No side kids.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.258
I know,
it's very white of me.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.226
(chuckles)

12:39.292 --> 12:42.796
Richard Marcus
Cooper is married.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.332
Tied the knot, till
death do you part.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.534
Mm-hmm.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.701
Something strange
about that?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.737
No. Just...

12:50.804 --> 12:53.473
not the Richie I knew.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.975
People change.
Hmm.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.978
You happily married?

12:58.045 --> 13:00.580
Yeah, I'm-I'm happily married.

13:00.647 --> 13:01.949
No, you're not.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.150
You didn't say it right.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.585
Okay, how was I
supposed to say it?

13:05.652 --> 13:07.020
Oh, I don't know.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.788
But you're not supposed
to think about it.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.723
I hear ice cracking.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.025
What?

13:12.092 --> 13:13.660
You ever walk across
a frozen river

13:13.726 --> 13:15.762
and hear ice cracking?

13:15.829 --> 13:17.697
It's the scariest sound
in the world.

13:17.764 --> 13:18.765
Hey, hey.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.067
My ice is fine.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.735
My-my marriage is frozen solid.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.671
You could do a triple axel
on my marriage.

13:24.737 --> 13:25.672
(phone ringing)

13:25.738 --> 13:26.706
One second.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.141
Hello.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.242
TRACY:
They're ready
to start the meeting.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.078
Yeah, yeah, I'll
come right now.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.546
So, to be
completely honest,

13:33.613 --> 13:35.348
I do need a favor.

13:35.415 --> 13:39.052
Ah. I knew Nikki didn't
come over here for nothing.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.889
Well, I just got back in town,
and I'm trying to get a job,

13:41.955 --> 13:43.723
but I need a reference.

13:43.790 --> 13:44.992
Okay, well,
write up a letter,

13:45.058 --> 13:46.593
bring it by,
and I'll sign it.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.827
No problem. Whoa!

13:47.895 --> 13:49.096
(chuckles)

13:49.162 --> 13:50.898
Magic.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.101
So you just knew
I would sign this, huh?

13:54.167 --> 13:57.104
I figured a friend in
need, couldn't resist.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.105
Okay.

14:02.642 --> 14:03.911
Good luck.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.579
Thank you...

14:06.646 --> 14:08.748
Mr. Married Man.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.850
RICHARD:
Even though I hadn't seen Nikki

14:10.918 --> 14:12.519
in eight years, I got to say,
Richard.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.022
she looked even better
than I remembered.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.189
Gonna put these right
on top of the block.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.025
KELLY:
Do I have to eat this, Mommy?

14:18.091 --> 14:19.026
BRENDA:
Kelly...
Hey.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.161
Hey, Daddy.
Hey, honey.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.231
Mm.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.465
I'm almost
done with them,

14:25.532 --> 14:27.167
and dinner will be ready
in a few minutes, okay?

14:27.234 --> 14:28.201
Is baked
chicken okay?

14:28.268 --> 14:29.336
Ah, you know
chicken's great.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.470
All right.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.005
Where's my kiss?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.007
Ooh, that's a good kiss.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.808
What's up, Bri?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.477
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.845
So how was school?

14:38.912 --> 14:40.413
You know that test I was giving?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.581
I had to give it again.

14:41.648 --> 14:42.950
They all got A's.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.717
Oh, um, Allison wants
to have a playdate

14:44.784 --> 14:45.852
this weekend
at her house.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.921
Any B-L-A-C-K kids
gonna be there?

14:47.988 --> 14:50.157
A few. Not enough.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.359
You know, I'm thinking of
joining a Mocha Moms group

14:52.425 --> 14:53.626
in New Rochelle.

14:53.693 --> 14:54.661
That'll be good.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.096
I got to do
something.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.632
Hey, how was,
um, work today?

14:59.699 --> 15:00.867
Anything happen?

15:00.934 --> 15:03.670
Ah, nothing much,
just work.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.904
RICHARD:
I'm not crazy.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.673
Would you tell your wife
about Nikki?

15:06.739 --> 15:10.610
But I got to admit, seeing
Nikki got me to thinking.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.213
What would it be like
to be single again?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.248
I mean, if I were single,

15:15.315 --> 15:17.784
I wouldn't do all that
romance-and-flowers crap.

15:17.850 --> 15:21.621
If I were single again,
I would get right to the point.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.790
Excuse me, would you
like to have sex with me?

15:23.856 --> 15:25.658
Of course I would.
Well, come on!

15:25.725 --> 15:28.361
When you're single, you're
never at a loss for words.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.630
Excuse me, can I
bite your ass?

15:30.697 --> 15:31.864
For $1,000.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.101
Come on, let's get
biting, bitch!

15:34.167 --> 15:36.903
When you're single,
you have nothing to lose.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.571
Come with me to a
hotel right now.

15:38.638 --> 15:39.872
But I have an appointment.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.574
Yeah, a pussy
appointment.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.444
When you're single,
you're invincible.

15:44.511 --> 15:45.278
Excuse me...

15:45.345 --> 15:47.080
Get the fuck
out of here!

15:47.147 --> 15:49.016
When you're single,
you're alone.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.783
I'll fuck you.

15:50.850 --> 15:53.153
And that's why I got married.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.227
When I went to work
the next day,

16:00.293 --> 16:03.030
being single was
the last thing on my mind.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.697
I had a lot to do,

16:04.764 --> 16:06.966
there was a big client
I wanted to bring in,

16:07.034 --> 16:09.302
and I needed to be focused.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.773
You know what I always say,

16:13.840 --> 16:16.609
valuation's an art
not a science.

16:16.676 --> 16:17.610
Hey, want to go to lunch?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.779
I got a plan how we can
reel in EuroTech.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.014
I'm gonna pass on the lunch,

16:21.081 --> 16:22.715
but let's talk about it
when you get back.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.817
Have fun with yourself.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.153
Walter, listen,

16:26.219 --> 16:27.820
I know you're in bed
with Cross and Lubitsch,

16:27.887 --> 16:28.888
but I'm telling you right now,

16:28.955 --> 16:30.190
you're gonna see
some things in the...

16:30.257 --> 16:32.025
There's a Nikki Tru
on line one.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.193
(whispers):
Tell her to hold.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.062
Well, I just
want you to know

16:35.128 --> 16:37.930
that our doors
are always open.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.666
All right, take care, Walter.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.401
(beep)

16:41.468 --> 16:42.535
Nikki.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.004
Hey.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.839
I got the job.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.208
Good.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.642
So as a thank you,

16:49.709 --> 16:53.012
I was thinking you should
let me take you to lunch.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.182
You know, I don't normally
do lunch till late.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.849
Well, that's okay,
'cause I'm still in bed,

16:56.916 --> 17:00.587
but I could get in the shower
and be to you in about an hour.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.688
You know, I got

17:01.754 --> 17:03.190
a lot of work to do, Nikki.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.826
But you are gonna
eat lunch, right?

17:06.893 --> 17:08.694
So I'll be there at 2:00.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.797
Okay?

17:10.863 --> 17:11.864
Okay.

17:11.931 --> 17:12.832
Good.

17:12.898 --> 17:14.501
Bye.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.734
(button tone sounds)

17:15.801 --> 17:18.905
MAN:
Excuse me, miss,
there's no smoking.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.772
Okay, I'm putting it out.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.911
I live on the West Side
with Teddy.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.445
He has a place here
and in D.C.,

17:26.512 --> 17:28.448
although most of my stuff
is in D.C.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.917
So how'd you meet
Teddy from D.C.?

17:30.983 --> 17:31.918
He's a club promoter.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.020
I met him out.

17:34.087 --> 17:34.954
You know how it goes.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.123
Yeah.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.826
So do I know your wife?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.761
I don't think so.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.563
Is she white?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.365
No.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.999
Why-why would you ask that?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.034
(chuckles)

17:48.101 --> 17:49.536
Don't get offended.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.371
Remember that girl you brought
to Andre's party?

17:51.438 --> 17:54.474
It was one girl
at one party.
(laughs)

17:54.541 --> 17:56.075
I-I go out with
one white girl,

17:56.143 --> 17:57.344
all of a sudden,
I'm Prince?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.179
No, it was just a question.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.314
I didn't mean anything by it.

18:03.650 --> 18:07.053
So do you and your black wife
still fuck?

18:07.120 --> 18:09.122
And what's it to you?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.723
Mmm, just curious.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.959
Most of the people I know
who are still married

18:13.025 --> 18:15.061
say that after a while,
they don't fuck.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.763
So do you love Teddy?

18:16.829 --> 18:19.199
You didn't answer my question.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.334
'Cause it's none
of your fucking business.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.570
I'll take that as a no.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.206
(laughs)

18:26.273 --> 18:28.708
So, Mr. Married Man,

18:28.775 --> 18:31.043
how did you meet
this black wife of yours?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.412
You don't
want to know.

18:32.479 --> 18:33.813
No, I do.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.881
Sort of.

18:34.947 --> 18:35.882
(chuckles)

18:35.948 --> 18:37.217
I was...

18:37.284 --> 18:40.487
coming from a meeting,
I was walking by the park,

18:40.553 --> 18:43.690
and she was there
with her class,

18:43.756 --> 18:45.825
this beautiful woman
with these kids.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.794
I don't know--
there was just something

18:47.860 --> 18:49.496
really calm about her.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.798
And I was like,
"I got to meet her."

18:51.864 --> 18:52.965
NIKKI:
Wow.

18:53.032 --> 18:55.635
(chuckling):
I guess I was wrong.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.737
You do love your wife.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.072
I've thought about it.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.810
Doing the whole wife thing,
having kids.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.078
I'm getting a little old
for the club scene.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.014
I don't even know
how you do it.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.616
Hanging out late,

19:09.682 --> 19:11.784
eating cheeseburgers
at 4:00 in the morning.
God...

19:11.851 --> 19:13.453
Come on.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.422
You used to love this shit.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.290
You just let yourself get old.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.826
I just let myself get bored.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.164
This was fun.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.967
We should do this again.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.703
Yeah. Maybe.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.405
Okay.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.317
RICHARD:
Saturday is the one day

19:44.384 --> 19:46.219
I like to sit
in my house and relax.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.755
Unfortunately,
it's also the same day

19:48.821 --> 19:51.824
that Brenda likes to go
into Manhattan and shop.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.193
Brenda didn't like
living in the city,

19:54.261 --> 19:56.729
but she sure liked
buying her clothes there.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.068
Honey, why don't you get these?

20:02.134 --> 20:03.069
I like them.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.237
Oh, yeah.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.572
Okay, well, let's
find your size

20:05.638 --> 20:06.873
so that you
can wear them.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.442
Ah, come on, we drove
all the way to the city.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.278
You could've got those
at the Panty Depot.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.979
Oh, come on.
No, I like these.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.814
And they're comfortable,
and they're cute.
Richard?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.583
Richard.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.784
(chuckles)

20:17.850 --> 20:19.218
I thought you lived
in Westchester.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.087
What are you doing here?
Hey.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.755
Nikki, Brenda.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.056
Brenda, Nikki.

20:24.123 --> 20:25.692
Hi.
Hi.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.059
(chuckles)

20:27.126 --> 20:28.528
Nikki's an old friend.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.863
Uh, what's it been,
like, seven, eight years?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.299
At least.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.268
Uh, Nikki used to date
Nelson, remember?

20:35.335 --> 20:37.337
Yes. Yes!

20:37.404 --> 20:38.538
(chuckling):
Right.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.607
And who is
this handsome guy?

20:40.673 --> 20:41.808
Oh, well,
that's my Brian.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.810
And that's Kelly.

20:43.876 --> 20:44.877
KELLY:
Hi.

20:44.944 --> 20:45.945
She's gorgeous.

20:46.012 --> 20:46.946
Of course, like her mom.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.047
Thank you.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.015
Say, "thank you," Kelly.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.717
KELLY:
Thank you.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.251
These are great.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.353
Where did you get these?

20:53.420 --> 20:55.588
Is this the Heavenly Collection?

20:55.655 --> 20:56.956
No, they're from
the Latifah Collection.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.124
(chuckling):
Okay.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.526
Stop.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.328
Um, actually,
I don't know what they are.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.395
But I got them downstairs.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.731
Well, I should go pay for these.

21:04.797 --> 21:05.698
(chuckles)

21:05.765 --> 21:07.900
Um, it was really
nice to meet you.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.235
Yes.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.904
And it was great
seeing you, Richard.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.173
Oh, great to see you.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.342
Guys.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.043
KELLY/BRIAN:
Bye-bye.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.248
So she's the
one that, uh,

21:22.315 --> 21:24.451
Nelson tried to
kill himself over?

21:24.517 --> 21:26.819
Yeah, he-he was going
through a lot back then.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.488
Huh.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.557
Yeah, guess he was.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.565
I'm gonna take these back.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.400
RICHARD:
Okay, that was a lie.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.234
But big deal.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.803
I mean, nothing happened.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.772
Nikki's a friend.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.039
An old friend.

21:47.106 --> 21:50.610
I mean, I've known Nikki
longer than I've known Brenda.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.545
She used to date Nelson.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.181
We had a lot of fun together.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.750
I mean,
sh-she makes me laugh.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.487
Th-There's nothing
wrong with that, right?

22:00.553 --> 22:03.690
Nikki's an old friend,
a good friend.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.759
A friend I can't
tell my wife about.

22:06.826 --> 22:07.627
Morning, Richard.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.529
Nikki called.
Five minutes ago.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.498
She said she'll be
by at 6:00.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.633
Is there
something wrong?

22:13.700 --> 22:14.534
No.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.703
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.140
Wall sconces?

22:21.207 --> 22:22.609
Well, they're not expensive

22:22.675 --> 22:24.577
and we can get an electrician
to put them in.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.446
What do you think of art deco?

22:26.513 --> 22:28.180
Art deco's fine.

22:28.247 --> 22:29.616
NIKKI:
Hey.

22:29.682 --> 22:30.850
Okay, if we go with art deco,

22:30.917 --> 22:32.318
we might have to reupholster
the couch.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.186
I thought we were
talking about wall sconces.

22:34.253 --> 22:35.555
Well, they have to match, honey.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.490
If they don't match,
then I got to change the rug.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.958
If I have to change the rug...
I guess you're right.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.828
Uh, honey, could we talk
about this later?

22:41.894 --> 22:42.929
(school bell rings)

22:42.995 --> 22:45.064
Yes. Look, I have to go--
it's parent-teacher night.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.333
I fixed you a plate, so just
heat it up when you get home.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.036
Okay. So I'll-I'll
talk to you later.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.939
(sighs)

22:53.005 --> 22:55.174
Wall sconces.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.109
Sounds fun.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.478
When exactly do you start

22:58.545 --> 23:00.413
getting calls at work
about wall sconces?

23:00.480 --> 23:01.781
Right after you get married.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.716
I mean, before you get married,
you get calls like...

23:03.783 --> 23:06.719
I can't wait to suck your dick.

23:06.786 --> 23:09.822
Then, after you get married,
you get calls like...

23:09.889 --> 23:12.124
I can't wait for you
to come home

23:12.191 --> 23:14.293
and see these drapes.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.363
Poor Mr. Married Man.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.398
I hope you don't mind me
stopping by like this,

23:19.466 --> 23:21.067
but I bought something
for your kids.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.035
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about you guys.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.871
Hey, you didn't have
to get me anything.

23:24.937 --> 23:25.872
I know.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.674
Thanks.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.676
This stuff's
expensive.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.244
Oh, don't worry
about it.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.581
I put it on Teddy's
credit card.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.816
So now I owe
Teddy some money.

23:36.883 --> 23:38.451
(laughs)

23:38.518 --> 23:41.754
So you're the expert--
what do you think?

23:41.821 --> 23:43.723
Would I make
a good wife?

23:43.790 --> 23:45.357
Nikki, you don't want
to be a wife.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.392
Why?

23:46.459 --> 23:47.460
You want a wedding.

23:47.527 --> 23:48.961
You want the show.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.997
Mm-hmm.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.532
What are you looking at?

23:52.599 --> 23:54.701
You have any singles?

23:54.767 --> 23:56.135
Yeah, I should have
about seven, eight bucks.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.169
What do you need?

23:57.236 --> 23:58.805
Just give me
all of it.

23:58.871 --> 24:02.174
All right, I'm gonna have
to break into my stripper stash.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.380
What are you doing?

24:08.447 --> 24:10.349
Feeding the fish.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.685
Come here.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.086
Look.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.090
Okay, who is
gonna get it?

24:18.157 --> 24:19.058
Oh, look at this guy.

24:21.193 --> 24:22.194
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:22.261 --> 24:23.162
Whoo...!

24:23.229 --> 24:24.363
Shh!

24:24.430 --> 24:25.698
It's just a dollar.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.133
It's just a dollar.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.300
It's just a buck.

24:28.367 --> 24:29.936
This is decadent.
Try it.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.303
All right.
All right, here we go.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.906
Whoo!

24:33.973 --> 24:34.907
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

24:34.974 --> 24:35.875
Yeah!

24:35.942 --> 24:37.544
You're going to
cause a riot.

24:37.610 --> 24:38.945
Well done!

24:40.246 --> 24:41.848
(laughing)

24:41.914 --> 24:43.349
Yes!

24:43.415 --> 24:44.917
Oh, wow!

24:44.984 --> 24:45.818
(laughing)

24:45.885 --> 24:47.987
Ooh, look at
the homeless guy.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.722
Oh, get the mon...
Oh, he needs it.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.123
Never gonna get it.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.058
Nope. Going
too slow.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.660
Come on, homeless guy.
You need that money.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.596
Get it.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.330
Nope.
Oh!

24:58.397 --> 25:00.266
White man wins again.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.537
(groans)

25:15.648 --> 25:17.650
RICHARD:
That was fun.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.186
That was too much fun.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.554
You know what?

25:21.621 --> 25:23.823
I better take my wife
out to dinner

25:23.890 --> 25:26.593
and get the stench of fun
with another woman off of me.

25:26.659 --> 25:27.827
BRENDA:
I don't even want

25:27.894 --> 25:30.496
to go that way;
you can't go down the FDR.

25:30.563 --> 25:31.731
WOMAN:
Oh, God, no.
It's insane.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.800
RICHARD:
Okay, this is safe.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.668
Dinner with Allan and Jennifer.

25:35.735 --> 25:36.936
Once you get married,

25:37.003 --> 25:38.805
you only hang out
with other married people.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.072
Why?

25:40.139 --> 25:43.409
'Cause no single person
could stand to be around you.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.511
It wasn't always like this.

25:45.578 --> 25:49.215
We all used to talk
about sex, politics, art.

25:49.281 --> 25:51.517
But now, all we ever
talk about is our kids.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.085
Of course, I had
to miss the end,

25:53.152 --> 25:55.487
because I had a little
exploding diaper problem.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.056
And when it's not our kids,

25:57.123 --> 25:59.091
it's always the same
conversation.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.860
First, there's
the rap conversation.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.962
...hos, hos, hos
in different area codes.

26:03.029 --> 26:05.698
I'm kind of wondering,
did anybody have a nice mama?

26:05.765 --> 26:06.966
Was it a situation
where their mama

26:07.033 --> 26:08.134
smacked them
upside their head,

26:08.200 --> 26:09.301
and they said, "Bitch!"

26:09.368 --> 26:11.203
Then there's the conversation
about the Jews.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.739
They had it just as bad as us.

26:12.805 --> 26:13.906
Black folks need
to take care of themselves

26:13.973 --> 26:15.374
just as well as the Jews
take care of themselves.

26:15.441 --> 26:17.076
Except we can't stick together--
that's the problem.

26:17.143 --> 26:20.179
We're too busy buying
spinning rims and gold teeth.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.248
You think Steven Spielberg
got spinning rims?

26:22.314 --> 26:25.017
And no group of people
are too sophisticated to have

26:25.084 --> 26:26.518
a conversation
about Michael Jackson.

26:26.585 --> 26:27.820
I blame Joe.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.455
ALLAN:
Please, what
grown-ass man

26:29.521 --> 26:31.123
sleeps in a bed with kids?

26:31.190 --> 26:33.225
Michael Jackson
just didn't have a childhood.

26:33.292 --> 26:36.095
Hey, man, childhood's only
12, 15 years.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.296
Michael's, like, 50.

26:37.363 --> 26:40.399
How many sliding boards
does this nigga need?

26:40.466 --> 26:42.702
You know good and well
you would not let that man
babysit your kids.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.638
I wouldn't let Michael Jackson
watch my kids on TV.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.506
Amen.
(laughter)

26:47.573 --> 26:49.075
Maybe he thought
the little boy was 18.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.576
ALLAN:
You can't confuse
the little boy.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.044
Give me a break.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.145
JENNIFER:
Just yesterday,
little Sharon

26:53.212 --> 26:54.513
came into the room
singing "Magic Stick."

26:54.580 --> 26:56.548
I said, "Magic Stick"? Little
girl, you're four years old.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.284
What do you know
about a magic stick?"

26:58.350 --> 27:00.152
Can I take
your drink orders?

27:00.219 --> 27:01.353
BRENDA:
Honey?

27:01.420 --> 27:03.122
Uh, you know what?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.590
Honey, can you just
get me some water?

27:04.657 --> 27:05.792
ALLAN:
Think I'll take
a ginger ale.

27:05.858 --> 27:06.859
JENNIFER:
I'll have a
Chardonnay.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.294
Okay.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.562
Excuse me, can I talk
to you for a second?

27:10.629 --> 27:12.231
Is there a
problem, sir?

27:12.298 --> 27:13.700
Yes, there's a problem.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.002
See, I came here
for a lovely dinner

27:16.068 --> 27:17.603
with my wife
and some friends,

27:17.670 --> 27:19.471
and next thing I know
is I got these big tits

27:19.538 --> 27:21.040
asking me
if I want a drink.

27:21.107 --> 27:23.475
Do you mean
your waitperson?

27:23.542 --> 27:25.644
Listen, man,
I'm with my wife.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.213
I don't need this shit.

27:27.279 --> 27:30.683
I don't need some girl, with
her big-ass village feeders,

27:30.750 --> 27:32.484
asking me if I need
some help.

27:32.551 --> 27:33.652
Is this Hooters?

27:33.720 --> 27:34.721
No, sir.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.155
Is it Hooters?
No, sir.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.790
I know this ain't Hooters,
'cause-'cause if it is,

27:37.857 --> 27:40.126
you owe me some
fucking buffalo wings.

27:40.192 --> 27:43.062
(whispering):
Sir, what can I do
to make this better?

27:44.997 --> 27:48.034
See that guy
right there?

27:48.100 --> 27:49.568
Yes, I do.

27:49.635 --> 27:52.271
That's my waiter.

27:53.472 --> 27:54.606
Thank you, sir.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.675
Thank you.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.911
(slow R&B beat playing)

27:58.978 --> 28:00.747
* It's been a long, long time *

28:00.813 --> 28:02.381
* It's been a while *

28:02.448 --> 28:04.183
* Since love's been gone *

28:04.250 --> 28:06.819
* Since you been gone *

28:06.886 --> 28:09.856
* Baby, you could be the one *

28:09.922 --> 28:12.792
* So, darling, come on *

28:12.859 --> 28:14.426
* Yeah *

28:14.493 --> 28:16.896
(faintly, in headphones):
* It's been a long, long time *

28:16.963 --> 28:19.198
What are you
doing here?

28:19.265 --> 28:20.767
You okay?

28:20.833 --> 28:23.335
So he just got up
and said, "It's over"?

28:23.402 --> 28:24.771
No, you don't understand.

28:24.837 --> 28:27.673
If we're fucking and I
fall asleep, that's fine.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.175
If we're fucking
and we both fall asleep,

28:29.241 --> 28:30.943
that's okay, too,
but if we're fucking

28:31.010 --> 28:33.880
and you fall asleep,
it's-it's fucked up!

28:33.946 --> 28:36.749
He didn't say it's over,
but I know it's over.

28:36.816 --> 28:39.551
You-you got to excuse her;
she's upset.

28:39.618 --> 28:41.453
The fuck are you
looking at?!

28:44.891 --> 28:47.459
Our stop's
coming up.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.831
RICHARD:
When Nikki came by
to see me in the afternoon,

28:51.898 --> 28:54.867
it wasn't really a big deal.

28:54.934 --> 28:58.304
But when we walked through
the office at 9:00 a.m...

28:58.370 --> 28:59.405
Good morning.

28:59.471 --> 29:02.842
...people looked at me
like I was crazy.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.211
I mean crazy.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.916
It's like we've been
breaking up for months,

29:09.982 --> 29:11.984
and I'm just finding out
about it now.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.085
Well, that's how
relationships are.

29:13.152 --> 29:16.022
You add how long
you been together,

29:16.088 --> 29:17.723
and then you divide it by two,

29:17.790 --> 29:19.258
and that's how long
you been breaking up.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.894
So if you get a divorce
after 20 years,

29:21.961 --> 29:23.695
you been breaking up for ten.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.865
That's right.

29:29.701 --> 29:32.271
So can I stay with you
for a couple days?

29:33.840 --> 29:35.507
Nikki, my wife...

29:35.574 --> 29:39.445
(laughing)

29:39.511 --> 29:41.080
Oh...

29:41.147 --> 29:43.349
I'm just playing with you.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.051
(chuckles)

29:45.117 --> 29:47.419
You should see the look
on your face right now.

29:49.488 --> 29:53.092
Okay, I'm not trying to get rid
of you, Nikki, but I really...

29:53.159 --> 29:55.261
iPod.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.695
(laughs)

29:56.762 --> 29:58.497
You got some nigga ears.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.066
Nigga what?

30:00.132 --> 30:02.068
Some old-ass
nigga ears.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.770
Look at this, Levert, Patti
LaBelle, Luther Vandross.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.472
You know, white people
make music, too.

30:06.538 --> 30:07.439
I got George Michael.

30:07.506 --> 30:08.607
Doesn't count.

30:08.674 --> 30:11.677
Okay, I'm gonna
give you my iPod,

30:11.743 --> 30:13.645
and you are gonna
give me yours.

30:13.712 --> 30:14.713
Okay.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.949
When you get a chance,

30:17.016 --> 30:20.953
I want you to listen
to that song.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.022
Can I get back
to work now?

30:23.089 --> 30:24.590
("Tired of You"
by Foo Fighters playing)

30:24.656 --> 30:28.727
* So shame on me for the ruse *

30:28.794 --> 30:33.332
* Shame on me for the blues *

30:33.399 --> 30:38.304
* Another one returned
that I'll never use *

30:42.308 --> 30:46.812
* I won't go
getting tired of you *

30:46.879 --> 30:51.517
* I won't go getting
tired of you *

30:51.583 --> 30:55.154
* I'm not getting tired *

30:55.221 --> 31:00.126
* I won't go
getting tired of you *

31:00.192 --> 31:04.596
* I won't go getting
tired of you *

31:04.663 --> 31:08.867
* I'm not getting tired *

31:08.935 --> 31:11.570
* Of you. *

31:13.772 --> 31:15.607
(rap music playing
through headphones)

31:24.350 --> 31:26.618
* Fuck the cracker,
that's what I say *

31:26.685 --> 31:28.988
* And fuck these bitches
that always want to play *

31:29.055 --> 31:31.290
* I'm the type of nigga
that's never gay *

31:31.357 --> 31:33.659
* If you fuck with me, I'll
put your head in cake... *

31:35.827 --> 31:37.229
(clears throat)

31:46.572 --> 31:49.575
(people conversing
indistinctly in distance)

31:53.112 --> 31:56.382
I think he might be
off the phone.

32:07.159 --> 32:09.161
(door opens)
Richard.

32:09.228 --> 32:10.229
That girl is here to see you.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.663
Well, just send her in.

32:11.730 --> 32:12.664
Richard...

32:13.799 --> 32:16.335
...can I ask you something?

32:16.402 --> 32:18.470
Hi.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.006
It can wait.

32:22.474 --> 32:25.211
I don't think your
secretaries like me.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.612
Hey, they don't like me, either.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.847
You know, if you keep
showing up like this,

32:28.914 --> 32:30.316
we're gonna have
to get you a job here.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.650
People are gonna
start talking.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.719
Oh, let them talk.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.321
I need you to
do me a favor.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.523
Can you come uptown with
me to look at a place?

32:37.589 --> 32:39.691
You know, I-I got
a lot of work to do.

32:39.758 --> 32:40.993
I got to get
out of Teddy's,

32:41.060 --> 32:44.363
and... he's supposed
to be out of town.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.698
I'd like to be out by
the time he gets back.

32:48.767 --> 32:49.801
Are you okay?

32:49.868 --> 32:52.971
Can you come with me?

32:53.039 --> 32:54.673
Yeah, yeah.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.308
Let me just check.
Okay.

32:56.375 --> 33:00.012
Tracy, what's my rest
of the day look like?

33:00.079 --> 33:02.081
You and George have a
conference call at 3:00.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.482
Damn. George!

33:03.549 --> 33:04.416
Yeah?

33:04.483 --> 33:06.418
You need me for
that call at 3:00?

33:06.485 --> 33:08.154
I do. Why?

33:08.220 --> 33:09.455
I got to do
something.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.790
I mean, I-I should be back,
but if I'm not,

33:11.857 --> 33:12.958
you can
handle it, right?

33:13.025 --> 33:15.127
Yeah, I got it, don't worry.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.762
Hi, I'm George.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.297
Nikki.
Nice to meet you.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.066
Likewise.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.668
So, I'll see you later?

33:22.734 --> 33:24.503
You tell me.

33:30.676 --> 33:33.011
RICHARD:
You sure this is what you want?

33:33.079 --> 33:35.147
NIKKI:
It's what I can afford.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.216
So, where do you work?

33:37.283 --> 33:40.018
I'm a hostess at
a place downtown
called The White Bar.

33:40.086 --> 33:43.489
Oh, that's nice.

33:43.555 --> 33:46.058
(clears throat)
Well, here you go.

33:46.125 --> 33:49.128
Washer and dryer
on the third floor,

33:49.195 --> 33:50.429
pay phone on the
second floor.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.231
Don't knock on my
door for change.

33:52.298 --> 33:54.032
Get your own
damn quarters.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.535
Um, there was something
in the ad about cable.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.804
I got jumper cables,
if you need 'em.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.971
Okay.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.340
And don't blame me
if the bed's

34:01.407 --> 34:02.974
not big enough
for both of you.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.410
This place is really
for students.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.044
(chuckles)
Oh, we are not a couple.

34:06.112 --> 34:07.546
Yeah, yeah, I-I'm
just a friend.

34:07.613 --> 34:08.614
Oh.

34:08.679 --> 34:11.083
I guess that's a Super Bowl
ring, huh?

34:11.150 --> 34:12.717
You a Jet or a Packer?

34:12.784 --> 34:14.520
Uh-huh.

34:14.585 --> 34:16.487
Which one of you friends
is paying the rent?

34:16.554 --> 34:17.856
I am.

34:17.922 --> 34:20.259
Sure you are, baby.

34:20.326 --> 34:22.793
I never thought I'd be
back in one of these.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.130
This is where
everybody ends up.

34:29.135 --> 34:32.871
WOMAN (on TV):
...a wooden Barton hutch
made of pine in Al's backyard.

34:32.938 --> 34:36.542
This is a project an experienced
do-it-yourselfer could tackle,

34:36.608 --> 34:41.079
since this shed is pre-cut
and ready to assemble.

34:41.147 --> 34:43.081
Hey, fellas.
MAN:
Hi!

34:43.149 --> 34:44.783
How are you guys?
Very well, thanks.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.985
That doesn't look so hard;
we can do that out back.

34:48.053 --> 34:50.822
I'm getting splinters
just watching this.

34:50.889 --> 34:53.359
(siren blaring in distance)

34:55.327 --> 34:58.230
I got to hand it to you--
you knocked it out the park.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.699
It looks like EuroTech
may come aboard.

35:00.766 --> 35:03.235
Hey, it's not a done deal,
and when it gets done,

35:03.302 --> 35:05.171
I couldn't have done
it without you.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.406
What do you say we go grab
some lunch and celebrate?

35:07.473 --> 35:10.309
I-I'd love to... but
I got other plans.

35:10.376 --> 35:12.211
NIKKI:
Hey, guys. You ready?

35:12.278 --> 35:14.580
Can I talk to
you for a second?

35:14.646 --> 35:15.847
Yeah, sure.

35:15.914 --> 35:17.216
GEORGE:
Inside.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.517
Be right back.
Okay.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.118
I'm sorry. I won't
keep him long.

35:20.186 --> 35:21.853
No problem.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.594
Okay, what is it?

35:28.660 --> 35:31.430
Are you aware of what
you're getting yourself into?

35:31.497 --> 35:32.498
What are you
talking about?

35:32.564 --> 35:34.500
Nikki-- she's here
every day.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.802
George, she's
just a friend.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.404
A friend? Come on.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.307
I've had friends before-- they
don't fucking look like Nikki.

35:41.373 --> 35:44.009
Look, you got a good situation
at home, you got two kids...

35:44.075 --> 35:45.711
I'm not fucking her.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.746
No, she's fucking you;
you just don't know it.

35:47.813 --> 35:51.583
(laughing):
I can't believe I'm hearing
this shit from you,

35:51.650 --> 35:53.084
of all people.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.354
You cheat on your
wife all the time.

35:55.421 --> 35:57.423
Last year, you were
fucking Tracy and Mary.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.857
I didn't say shit to you.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.359
That's different.

36:00.426 --> 36:01.927
I don't give a fuck.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.562
I can fuck a girl, go home,

36:03.629 --> 36:06.064
kiss my wife good night
and sleep like a baby.

36:06.131 --> 36:08.667
You, on the other hand,
got emotions.

36:08.734 --> 36:11.737
You're like Captain
Save-A-Ho, all right?

36:11.803 --> 36:14.440
You like to be needed,
and that bitch knows it.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.376
Are we done?

36:17.443 --> 36:19.711
I'm not getting
in your shit, all right?

36:19.778 --> 36:21.980
I just...

36:22.047 --> 36:23.915
Be careful, okay?

36:29.655 --> 36:31.257
Hey.

36:31.323 --> 36:32.658
What's wrong?

36:32.724 --> 36:34.293
You look upset.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.328
We can't do
this anymore.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.629
Do what?
What are you talking about?

36:37.696 --> 36:40.666
This whole... lunch in
the afternoon thing.

36:40.732 --> 36:43.001
It doesn't look good;
we really should stop.

36:43.068 --> 36:44.169
We're not doing anything.

36:44.236 --> 36:45.271
It's not like
we're fucking.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.505
It is like
we're fucking,

36:46.572 --> 36:48.474
only thing, we're
not fucking,

36:48.540 --> 36:50.742
and I feel all the guilt
as if I'm fucking you

36:50.809 --> 36:53.245
without any of the pleasure
of actually fucking you.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.314
I don't want things to
get anymore complicated.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.883
I'm not trying
to complicate anything.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.218
I like you, Richard.

37:00.286 --> 37:03.021
I don't like
a lot of people.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.857
I like you
'cause you're safe.

37:07.092 --> 37:09.194
You don't want
anything from me.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.430
Okay?

37:13.064 --> 37:14.199
Okay.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.667
(giggles)

37:15.734 --> 37:17.202
So, you want to get
something to eat?

37:17.269 --> 37:18.604
No.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.806
I have something
else planned.

37:20.872 --> 37:23.041
("The Seed 2.0"

37:23.108 --> 37:24.843

37:24.910 --> 37:26.912
* And what she finna have,
she don't know *

37:26.978 --> 37:29.281
* She want neo-soul,
'cause hip-hop is old *

37:29.348 --> 37:31.383
* She don't want
no rock and roll *

37:31.450 --> 37:33.552
* She want platinum
or ice and gold *

37:33.619 --> 37:35.687
* She want a whole lot
of something to fold *

37:35.754 --> 37:37.823

she just drop you cold *

* For much these days *

37:46.264 --> 37:48.534
Wow.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.836
I've been thinking
about coming here.

37:50.902 --> 37:51.803
I knew you'd like it.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.306
* ...if I don't get my way... *

37:54.373 --> 37:56.342
You should have
one of these.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.777
Wanted one of these
since I was a kid.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.679
That I don't know.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.514
What I know is that
I'm gonna get me

38:02.581 --> 38:04.115
a little Porsche
one day.

38:04.182 --> 38:07.118
You're going down!
You're going down!

38:07.185 --> 38:08.186
I'm going down,
all right.

38:08.253 --> 38:09.721
(both laughing)

38:09.788 --> 38:12.691
* It's gonna work because
I'm pushing it right *

38:12.758 --> 38:14.092
(screams)

38:14.159 --> 38:15.226
Oh!
Yeah, yeah.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.529
You dirty, dirty...!

38:37.449 --> 38:38.984
What is that?!

38:39.050 --> 38:40.251
Richard!

38:40.318 --> 38:42.388
Richard, Brian's asleep ups...!

38:45.357 --> 38:46.758
(turns music off)

38:46.825 --> 38:48.226
What is that?

38:48.293 --> 38:49.495
You-You don't
like it?

38:49.561 --> 38:50.562
No, no, I don't.

38:50.629 --> 38:51.663
And you're making
the kids deaf.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.064
Ah, come on, it's
not that loud.

38:53.131 --> 38:54.165
Yes, it is.

38:54.232 --> 38:55.266
And you know what?

38:55.333 --> 38:57.268
I was in my car
the other day, and...

38:57.335 --> 38:59.170
Where did my CDs go?

38:59.237 --> 39:01.239
Wh-Where's my,
where's my Peabo Bryson?

39:01.306 --> 39:02.908
Where's my Usher?
Where's my BeyoncÃ©?

39:02.974 --> 39:04.943
(chuckles)
You know, you really got
some nigga ears, honey.

39:09.114 --> 39:10.582
Nigga ears?

39:10.649 --> 39:12.250
How many times do I
have to ask you

39:12.317 --> 39:14.052
not to talk in front
of the kids like that?

39:14.119 --> 39:15.387
You know what?

39:15.454 --> 39:16.455
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

39:16.522 --> 39:17.589
'Cause one of these days,

39:17.656 --> 39:19.558
they won't be asking
where my daddy is,

39:19.625 --> 39:21.393
they'll be asking,
"Where's my nigga?"

39:23.462 --> 39:25.864
Then what are you
gonna do?

39:25.931 --> 39:26.865
(groans)

39:27.933 --> 39:29.701
You know, I tried
calling you yesterday,

39:29.768 --> 39:31.102
and no one could find you.

39:31.169 --> 39:34.506
Was probably at lunch.

39:34.573 --> 39:35.874
No, it was almost 4:00.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.042
Aren't you usually
back by then?

39:37.108 --> 39:38.877
I mean, I tried
calling you on your cell,

39:38.944 --> 39:40.979
I tried texting you,
you didn't text me back.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.113
What did you want?

39:42.180 --> 39:43.114
What difference
does it make

39:43.181 --> 39:44.182
what I wanted?

39:44.249 --> 39:45.584
That was yesterday.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.819
You have to tell people
where you are.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.320
What if something
happened to the kids?

39:49.387 --> 39:50.856
What if I got hit by a car?

39:50.922 --> 39:52.524
Ah, come on, why do you always
have to take it to,

39:52.591 --> 39:54.392
"What if I got hit by a car?"

39:54.460 --> 39:56.161
I-I went to the deli,

39:56.227 --> 39:57.295
I wanted a chicken
salad sandwich.

39:57.362 --> 39:58.564
I-I stood on line.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.265
Uh, when I got to
the front of the line,

40:00.331 --> 40:01.467
I realized I didn't
have a ticket,

40:01.533 --> 40:03.134
so I had to get
back on the line.

40:03.201 --> 40:04.703
That's it.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.772
You make it sound
like an alibi.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.406
All you have to do
is answer the phone.

40:08.474 --> 40:11.076
I didn't hear it.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.612
All right.

40:16.114 --> 40:17.483
Tomorrow.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.551
Have you thought
about what you want to do?

40:19.618 --> 40:21.186
Do you want
to see a movie?

40:21.252 --> 40:23.722
Do you want to have brunch
with Jennifer and Allan?

40:23.789 --> 40:26.191
Nah, nah, nah, we do
that all the time.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.826
Let's try something
different.

40:27.893 --> 40:30.395
Different?

40:30.462 --> 40:31.563
Okay.

at the new Porsches.

No. No, no, no, no.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.490
In here, it says that
there's something over there

40:58.557 --> 41:00.526
that you're really
gonna like.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.160
Oh, yeah. Come on.

for our company?

we're finding now

41:46.404 --> 41:49.507
is that most
advertising dollars
are migrating online.

41:49.575 --> 41:52.544

41:52.611 --> 41:54.412
Is that you?

41:54.479 --> 41:56.815
(ringing continues)

41:56.882 --> 41:58.049
It's me.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.618
I probably
should, uh...
Mm-hmm.

Richard, I have an emergency.

42:01.953 --> 42:03.555
I need to ask you something,

42:03.622 --> 42:05.356
but I'm afraid
you're gonna get mad at me.

42:05.423 --> 42:07.292
I have to
take this.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.560
Um, if you'll
excuse me,

42:08.627 --> 42:10.228
I'll be, I'll
be right back.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.339
I can't really talk right now;
I'm in a meeting.

42:21.406 --> 42:22.574
Okay, really quick.

42:22.641 --> 42:24.075
Just promise you won't
get mad at me.

42:24.142 --> 42:26.177
I won't get mad.

42:26.244 --> 42:27.579
You didn't promise.

42:27.646 --> 42:30.849
(whispering):
Okay, I promise.

42:30.916 --> 42:33.785
Will you come with me to get my
stuff out of Teddy's apartment?

42:33.852 --> 42:35.887
Didn't you hear me tell you
I'm in a meeting?

42:35.954 --> 42:36.922
Not today,

42:36.988 --> 42:38.123
tomorrow.

42:38.189 --> 42:39.357
Fine.

42:39.424 --> 42:40.759
Okay? I got to go now.

All right,
so where's this guy live?

43:01.312 --> 43:02.948
'Cause I got things
to do.

43:03.014 --> 43:05.483
Shuttle's in,
like, 45 minutes.

43:05.550 --> 43:06.918
Shuttle?

43:06.985 --> 43:09.454
Wh-What are you
talking about, shuttle?

43:09.520 --> 43:10.689
To D.C.

43:10.756 --> 43:12.624
Remember I told you,
we have a place there,

43:12.691 --> 43:15.593
and he's out of town, so
now I can get my shit.

43:15.661 --> 43:18.296
I'm not going
with you to D.C.

43:18.363 --> 43:19.998
You promised.

43:20.065 --> 43:22.467
I didn't promise to go
with you to another state.

43:22.533 --> 43:24.836
It's not a state,
it's a district.

43:24.903 --> 43:27.138
It's, like, a
30-minute flight.

43:27.205 --> 43:29.741
You must be
out of your fucking mind

43:29.808 --> 43:33.011
if you think I'm getting
on a plane to Washington D.C.

43:33.078 --> 43:35.847
to go to some guy's house
to get your shit!

43:45.523 --> 43:46.424
GEORGE:
Richard?

43:46.491 --> 43:47.759
Richard, yeah.

43:47.826 --> 43:49.928
Uh, I have one question for you:

43:49.995 --> 43:51.229
Where the fuck are you?

43:51.296 --> 43:52.463
No, no, no, don't worry.

43:52.530 --> 43:53.665
I'll be there.

43:53.732 --> 43:55.533
Yeah, something
just came up.

43:55.600 --> 43:56.835
Look, just get here, okay?

43:56.902 --> 43:58.403
I told you I need you
on this one.

43:58.469 --> 44:00.505
Tell Mary that
if Nikki calls,

44:00.571 --> 44:01.673
I'll call her tomorrow.

44:01.740 --> 44:04.475
Tell her yourself
when you get here.

44:04.542 --> 44:07.112
You're a good liar.

44:07.178 --> 44:09.547
Listen, we're getting
on the 1:00 shuttle,

44:09.614 --> 44:10.648
not a moment later, okay?

44:10.716 --> 44:12.250
'Cause I got
a meeting at 3:00.

44:12.317 --> 44:14.019
Okay.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.663
(siren blaring)

44:28.967 --> 44:29.835
NIKKI:
Right here.

44:29.901 --> 44:30.969
Here?
Uh-huh.

44:31.036 --> 44:32.670
What are all these
cops doing here?

44:32.738 --> 44:34.706
Oh, it's kind of
a crazy neighborhood.

44:34.773 --> 44:35.974
Something's always
going down.

44:36.041 --> 44:37.843
We'll be right back.
Okay.

44:37.909 --> 44:39.945
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

44:43.314 --> 44:45.050
So how many cities
have you lived in

44:45.116 --> 44:47.018
with this Teddy guy?
Hey, police!
Open up in there!

44:47.085 --> 44:49.821
Uh, here, and New York.
Open up in there!

44:49.888 --> 44:51.356
In Miami, I lived
with his brother.

44:51.422 --> 44:52.223
That's where
I met him.

44:52.290 --> 44:53.725
Wait a minute,
you lived with a guy,

44:53.792 --> 44:56.261
then you left him
for his brother?

44:56.327 --> 44:57.362
How'd you pull that off?

44:57.428 --> 44:58.563
I got a hard enough time

44:58.629 --> 45:00.598
telling my wife
I want pancakes.

45:00.665 --> 45:01.900
We're in.

45:09.674 --> 45:12.110
All right,
now that we're in,

45:12.177 --> 45:13.745
I want you to
get your shit

45:13.812 --> 45:15.280
and let's get
out of here.

45:15.346 --> 45:17.749
I'm just gonna grab
a few dresses, some shoes,

45:17.816 --> 45:18.716
and then we'll go.

45:18.784 --> 45:20.218
Okay.

45:20.285 --> 45:21.486
Thank you.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.454
Forget "Thank you,"
just hurry up.

45:27.926 --> 45:29.394
Teddy's doing
pretty good.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.328
Mm-hmm.

45:34.532 --> 45:37.068
(sirens in distance)

45:40.338 --> 45:42.908
You were on the math team
in high school?

45:42.974 --> 45:45.176
For two years. Why?

45:45.243 --> 45:46.211
I don't know.

45:46.277 --> 45:48.880
Just can't imagine you
solving a problem.

45:48.947 --> 45:51.817
My Ferretti sweater.

45:51.883 --> 45:54.820
I had no idea
where this was.

46:01.827 --> 46:03.294
Richard Cooper's office.

46:03.361 --> 46:04.362
Hi, Brenda.

46:06.231 --> 46:07.532
Hey, somebody
around here's

46:07.598 --> 46:09.500
got some nigga ears.

46:09.567 --> 46:12.437
Excuse me?

46:12.503 --> 46:13.905
Biz Markie's Greatest Hits.

46:13.972 --> 46:16.842
That man is a genius.

46:16.908 --> 46:19.144
The genius that wrote
"Pickin' Boogers."

46:19.210 --> 46:21.512
"Pickin' Boogers," "The Vapors"
(laughing)

46:21.579 --> 46:23.481
and of course, my favorite...

46:23.548 --> 46:24.850
* You *

46:24.916 --> 46:27.018
* You got what I need *

46:27.085 --> 46:30.721
BOTH:
* But you say
he's just a friend *

46:30.788 --> 46:32.858
* But you say
he's just a friend *

46:32.924 --> 46:34.759
* Oh, baby, you *

46:34.826 --> 46:35.861
(grunts)

46:35.927 --> 46:38.196
* You got what I need. *

46:38.263 --> 46:39.764
(both laughing)

46:39.831 --> 46:42.667
(music winds down, stops)

46:42.733 --> 46:43.801
Okay, Teddy, calm down.

46:43.869 --> 46:45.203
You know you got
two strikes.

46:45.270 --> 46:46.604
There's cops
all over the place.

46:46.671 --> 46:47.772
(drops keys)

46:47.839 --> 46:49.440
How the fuck
y'all get in here, man?

46:49.507 --> 46:50.508
Huh?

46:50.575 --> 46:52.043
Who the fuck are you?

46:52.110 --> 46:54.379
Huh?

46:54.445 --> 46:56.381
What, this the new nigga?

46:56.447 --> 46:58.416
You fucking him now? Huh?

46:58.483 --> 47:00.151
You the new nigga, man?

47:00.218 --> 47:02.854
No, no, I'm-I'm
not the new nigga.

47:02.921 --> 47:05.156
I've n-never been the nigga,
I'm just a... friend.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.093
How's it going?
Richard Cooper.

47:08.526 --> 47:09.527
Oh!

47:09.594 --> 47:10.828
Teddy!
Motherfucker!

47:10.896 --> 47:12.163
Teddy, what the fuck's
wrong with you?!

47:12.230 --> 47:14.199
You bring this stupid-ass nigga
Stop it!

47:14.265 --> 47:15.466
in my fucking crib?!
Teddy!

47:15.533 --> 47:16.567
(screaming)
Help!

47:16.634 --> 47:17.835
Fuck you!
Somebody help!

47:17.903 --> 47:19.837
Take the boot! Take the boot!
Somebody help us!

47:19.905 --> 47:20.872
Take the motherfucking boot!

47:20.939 --> 47:22.573
Hi, Mr. Landis, it's Tracy.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.876
You like the taste, huh?!
You like the taste?!

47:24.943 --> 47:26.111
Everybody freeze!
You like the
fucking taste?!

47:26.177 --> 47:27.545
Crunch it down, motherfucker!

47:27.612 --> 47:28.613
Hey! Get him now!
What?!

47:28.679 --> 47:29.915
He's in a conference meeting.

47:29.981 --> 47:30.982
Everyone all right?
TEDDY:
We good.

47:31.049 --> 47:32.050
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I'm fine.

47:32.117 --> 47:34.085
This motherfucker
broke into my crib...

47:34.152 --> 47:35.320
with this bitch here!

47:35.386 --> 47:36.521
(all screaming)

47:39.690 --> 47:41.993
Thug life! Thug life!

47:42.060 --> 47:43.861
Thug life!
(police shouting)

47:43.929 --> 47:45.230
Thug life, nigga!
Thug life!

47:45.296 --> 47:46.731
Wait, wait, wait,
we can't do this.

47:46.797 --> 47:47.798
(two gunshots)
Fuck that!

47:47.865 --> 47:48.799
RICHARD:
Oh, yes, we can!

47:48.866 --> 47:49.901
TEDDY:
Thug fucking life!

47:49.968 --> 47:52.003
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

47:52.070 --> 47:53.504
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

47:53.571 --> 47:54.339
He could've killed us!

47:54.405 --> 47:55.840
You told me
he was out of town!

47:55.907 --> 47:57.375
Sorry!
And the damn cops
coming here!

47:57.442 --> 47:58.910
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

47:58.977 --> 48:00.979
I should be in
a meeting right now!

48:06.284 --> 48:07.452
No, no.

48:07.518 --> 48:09.354
No, no, no!

48:11.722 --> 48:13.658
Could you hurry up?

48:18.930 --> 48:21.967
(woman speaking indistinctly
over intercom)

48:24.202 --> 48:26.337
(metal detector beeping)

48:28.806 --> 48:30.641
(high-pitched
electrical whining)

48:34.845 --> 48:38.116
I don't care about "Thriller."

48:38.183 --> 48:41.886
What kind of grown man
has kids sleeping in his bed?

48:41.953 --> 48:44.855
He'll never babysit my kids.

48:44.922 --> 48:46.757
Look, we don't have all day.

48:46.824 --> 48:48.193
LANDIS:
I'm-I'm sorry, Mr. Yuni.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.827
I'm-I'm sure
Mr. Cooper will be here

48:49.894 --> 48:52.063
in a moment
with the prospectus.

48:52.130 --> 48:53.198
(clears throat)

48:53.264 --> 48:54.532
(whispering):
Where the fuck is he?

48:54.599 --> 48:55.933
I'm sure he's got
a good explanation.

48:56.001 --> 48:57.068
(groans)

48:59.004 --> 49:00.305
Excuse me.

49:00.371 --> 49:02.373
George, there's a call
for you in your office.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.242
Ah. Excuse me.

49:04.309 --> 49:07.012
Actually, I
like "Thriller."

49:07.078 --> 49:08.513
Michael's
last big one.

49:08.579 --> 49:09.480
Yeah.

49:09.547 --> 49:11.216
I knew he was gonna
be a star, you know,

49:11.282 --> 49:12.383
when I saw him on Ed Sullivan.

49:12.450 --> 49:14.085
WOMAN:
All flights in and out

49:14.152 --> 49:15.186
of New York LaGuardia
have been delayed

49:15.253 --> 49:17.088
possibly three to four hours.

49:17.155 --> 49:18.523
Thank you for your patience.

49:18.589 --> 49:19.457
George...

49:19.524 --> 49:21.659
I've been trying
to cover for you.

49:21.726 --> 49:23.794
They want to start--
where the fuck are you?

49:23.861 --> 49:24.862
Landis is pissed.

49:24.929 --> 49:27.765
I'm not going to make it.

49:27.832 --> 49:30.201
Oh, fuck!

49:30.268 --> 49:31.969
Fuck!

49:32.037 --> 49:33.471
Hey, Anita.
How you doing?

49:33.538 --> 49:34.872
George, calm down.

49:34.939 --> 49:36.807
You can do this.
You can handle it.

49:36.874 --> 49:38.343
Just calm down.
No...

49:38.409 --> 49:39.310
Goddamn it,

49:39.377 --> 49:40.545
Richard!

49:40.611 --> 49:42.447
You're killing me!

49:44.749 --> 49:46.417
I hope she's worth it.

49:46.484 --> 49:48.453
(exhales)

49:51.656 --> 49:54.125
Fuck!

50:00.398 --> 50:02.467
I'm afraid we either
have to get started

50:02.533 --> 50:03.368
or we have to go.

50:03.434 --> 50:04.969
We have another appointment.

50:05.036 --> 50:06.637
Can we
get started?

50:06.704 --> 50:08.706
Of course.
Absolutely.

50:08.773 --> 50:11.509
Okay, um...

50:11.576 --> 50:13.811
Mr. Yuni, my apologies, uh, but
I have been working very closely

50:13.878 --> 50:15.313
(Yuni speaking
Japanese)
with Mr. Cooper on this

50:15.380 --> 50:16.781
and I'm prepared
to walk us through it.

50:16.847 --> 50:17.682
(men speaking Japanese angrily)

50:17.748 --> 50:19.317
Um, if you take a look
at, uh, page two...

50:19.384 --> 50:20.751
I'm sorry, page... three.

50:20.818 --> 50:21.786
(clears throat)

50:21.852 --> 50:23.688
Performance chart from 19...

50:23.754 --> 50:25.656
(men, woman speaking Japanese)

50:32.263 --> 50:35.766
(TV playing in background)

50:35.833 --> 50:38.603
Hey, baby,
you're late.

50:38.669 --> 50:40.305
What happened?

50:40.371 --> 50:41.706
(sighs)
I got in a fight.

50:41.772 --> 50:42.940
A fight?

50:43.007 --> 50:44.942
What hap... Why?
What happened?

50:45.009 --> 50:46.644
I was pulling the car
out the lot,

50:46.711 --> 50:47.812
and this guy cut me off,

50:47.878 --> 50:50.715
and he gets out of his car,
then I got out of my car,

50:50.781 --> 50:52.217
and, next thing I know,
we're on the ground,

50:52.283 --> 50:54.385
and we're...
No, stop.
No, stop.

50:54.452 --> 50:56.954
That is, that's-that's the
dumbest shit in the world.

50:57.021 --> 50:57.955
I can't
believe your...

50:58.022 --> 51:01.126
You're a grown man!
You...

51:01.192 --> 51:02.493
All right, De la Hoya,
you know what?

51:02.560 --> 51:04.362
You put the dishes away,
and I'm gonna go upstairs.

51:04.429 --> 51:07.765
I'm gonna pretend
I'm married to a grown man.

51:07.832 --> 51:10.301
WOMAN (on TV):
...breaking news, this just in.

51:10.368 --> 51:13.238
MAN:
Today, in national news,
a Washington D.C. man

51:13.304 --> 51:16.141
named Teddy Smith shot
and wounded two police officers.

51:16.207 --> 51:19.043
He was later apprehended
after a violent standoff.

51:19.110 --> 51:21.146
More news after the break.

51:35.960 --> 51:38.863
Shit.

51:38.929 --> 51:40.465
(sighs)

51:40.531 --> 51:42.567
(rips paper)

51:48.606 --> 51:50.808
Cooper, you're
a good banker.

51:50.875 --> 51:54.044
You've brought a lot
of money to this company.

51:54.111 --> 51:56.614
Do you think you've brought a
lot of money into this company?

51:56.681 --> 51:59.350
Yeah, I've-I've, I've
brought some money in.

51:59.417 --> 52:01.051
Well, in all the years
you've been here,

52:01.118 --> 52:02.920
you've brought in
close to $20 million.

52:02.987 --> 52:04.955
That's a lot
of money, right?

52:05.022 --> 52:07.024
Right?

52:07.091 --> 52:09.294
I-I guess so.

52:09.360 --> 52:12.096
See this quarter?

52:12.163 --> 52:13.097
See it?

52:13.164 --> 52:15.032
Yes, I see it.

52:15.099 --> 52:17.268
This quarter is you.

52:17.335 --> 52:19.870
This is $20 million.

52:19.937 --> 52:22.340
Do you see this table?

52:22.407 --> 52:24.709
This is Pupkin
& Langford.

52:24.775 --> 52:28.446
This is $800 million.

52:28.513 --> 52:30.515
This is your value
to the company.

52:32.116 --> 52:33.918
You're on probation.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.820
Anymore problems, you're fired.

52:35.886 --> 52:36.954
Are we clear?

52:37.021 --> 52:38.689
Yes, sir.

52:40.891 --> 52:43.394
You know, Cooper,

52:43.461 --> 52:46.130
you can lose a lot of money
chasing women,

52:46.197 --> 52:49.367
but you'll never lose women
chasing money.

52:59.744 --> 53:01.679
* *

53:05.916 --> 53:07.318
RICHARD:
I got lucky.

53:07.385 --> 53:10.154
I still had my job,
I still had my family.

53:10.221 --> 53:12.290
All I had to do was one thing.

53:12.357 --> 53:13.891
Nikki is on line one.

53:13.958 --> 53:15.493
Tell her I'm not here.

53:15.560 --> 53:17.395
Sure.

53:18.629 --> 53:20.130
("The World I Know"
by Esthero playing)

53:20.197 --> 53:21.832
Sorry, he's
not in right now.

53:21.899 --> 53:23.301
* The world I know *

53:23.368 --> 53:26.337
* Is a world too slow *

53:26.404 --> 53:29.974
* Don't move fast enough *

53:30.040 --> 53:33.010
* Keep your head low *

53:33.077 --> 53:34.279
* The world I know *

53:34.345 --> 53:35.713
Nikki called twice.

53:35.780 --> 53:37.848
What should I tell her
if she calls again?

53:37.915 --> 53:39.384
Just tell her I'm not here.

53:39.450 --> 53:42.353
* If you can't move
fast enough, child *

53:42.420 --> 53:43.721
Way overboard.
(phone ringing)

53:43.788 --> 53:45.656
I'm not offended,
I just don't...

53:45.723 --> 53:47.525
Well, you know what?
You have to...

53:47.592 --> 53:49.159
Richard Cooper's
office.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.328
I'm not here.

53:50.395 --> 53:51.529
He's not in the
office right now.

53:51.596 --> 53:52.697
Can I take
a message?

53:52.763 --> 53:55.833
Well, can you let him know
that I called?

53:55.900 --> 53:58.068
Tell her I'm dead.

53:58.135 --> 54:00.638
Okay.
Really dead.

54:00.705 --> 54:01.639
Will do, Nikki.

54:01.706 --> 54:02.640
Really dead.

54:02.707 --> 54:03.508
Yes.

54:03.574 --> 54:06.444
* This night could be ours *

54:11.282 --> 54:14.184
* The world I know *

54:14.251 --> 54:17.322
* Is a world too slow *

54:17.388 --> 54:20.925
* Don't move fast enough *

54:20.991 --> 54:23.961
* Keep your head low *

54:24.028 --> 54:26.997
* The world I know *

54:27.064 --> 54:29.734
* Is a world much too slow *

54:29.800 --> 54:33.304
* If you can't move
fast enough, child *

54:33.371 --> 54:37.107
* Better stay
on the low, child *

54:37.174 --> 54:39.043
* And I want a life... *

54:39.109 --> 54:41.412
(song fades)

54:41.479 --> 54:44.815
(rock music plays over speakers)

54:44.882 --> 54:46.451
MAN:
The Killers?

54:46.517 --> 54:48.886
I always thought you were
more of a Wu-Tang guy.

54:48.953 --> 54:50.154
Nelson?

54:50.220 --> 54:51.221
Get outta here!

54:51.288 --> 54:52.757
Long time, no see.

54:52.823 --> 54:54.158
Yeah.

54:54.224 --> 54:56.293
Same to you,
Mr. Wall Street.

54:56.361 --> 54:58.228
Are you still working
down at Pupkin & Langford?

54:58.295 --> 54:59.664
Yeah, I-I think
I'm still there.

54:59.730 --> 55:01.098
We'll see how
long that lasts.

55:01.165 --> 55:02.467
Hmm.
So, what are you up to?

55:02.533 --> 55:04.502
Oh. Shit, nothing much.

55:04.569 --> 55:06.303
Doing a little work
for the Legal Defense Fund.

55:06.371 --> 55:07.572
It's going okay.

55:07.638 --> 55:09.874
Figured I'd come in here
and pick up a few CDs.

55:09.940 --> 55:11.476
Pretty soon, the only place
you'll be able

55:11.542 --> 55:13.043
to buy 'em is at Starbucks.

55:13.110 --> 55:14.679
I know, and they don't
sell any rap at Starbucks.

55:14.745 --> 55:17.415
I guess you want some rap, you
got to go to a liquor store.

55:17.482 --> 55:20.418
Yeah, let me get a pint
of Jack and that Ja Rule.

55:20.485 --> 55:23.388
Hey, guess who I saw
two weeks ago-- Nikki.

55:23.454 --> 55:26.824
She said she bumped
into you or something, right?

55:26.891 --> 55:29.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she
came by the office.

55:29.427 --> 55:30.928
So, how was that for you?

55:30.995 --> 55:33.030
I mean, you guys had
a pretty bad breakup.

55:33.097 --> 55:35.433
No, no, it was actually kind
of cool to see her again.

55:35.500 --> 55:37.101
I mean, if I'd ran into her

55:37.167 --> 55:38.536
without my medication,
who knows?

55:38.603 --> 55:40.838
But, uh... we talked
for a minute.

55:40.905 --> 55:42.540
You know, caught up.

55:42.607 --> 55:45.510
Got to tell you, Rich, man,
she still look good.

55:45.576 --> 55:48.379
I mean, she's... that
(mumbles)... fine!

55:48.446 --> 55:50.147
She's... man, just
the way she's shaped...

55:50.214 --> 55:52.483
I mean, you see her skin?!
Did you... you saw her.

55:52.550 --> 55:54.685
I mean it
ju-ju-just... smooth.

55:54.752 --> 55:57.588
I looked at her, I kept
watching her, next thing I know,

55:57.655 --> 55:58.956
I'd been looking at her
for 20 minutes.

55:59.023 --> 56:00.691
And I realized I was following
her, you know what I mean?

56:00.758 --> 56:01.959
I mean, it wasn't creepy
or nothing, you know.

56:02.026 --> 56:03.894
I didn't...
I don't think she saw me.

56:03.961 --> 56:06.230
And I'm just gonna,
you know, stay away.

56:06.296 --> 56:07.632
I'm getting
my life together.

56:07.698 --> 56:09.800
Anyway, if you see Nikki,
you tell her I said hello.

56:09.867 --> 56:12.670
Don't... no, don't...
don't do that. Don't.

56:12.737 --> 56:14.405
It's good
to see you, Rich.

56:14.472 --> 56:19.677
* The world I know
is a world too slow *

56:19.744 --> 56:21.746
* Don't move fast enough... *

56:21.812 --> 56:23.581
Hey, Richard, I have
some messages for you.

56:23.648 --> 56:26.617
* Keep your head low *

56:26.684 --> 56:29.454
* The world I know
is a world... *

56:29.520 --> 56:31.121
Did Nikki call?

56:31.188 --> 56:32.657
No, she didn't.

56:32.723 --> 56:35.660
I guess she finally
got the hint.

56:35.726 --> 56:39.730
* Better stay
on the low, child *

56:39.797 --> 56:44.902
* And I want a life lover
that'll go that far *

56:44.969 --> 56:47.872
* We don't have
to do this right *

56:47.938 --> 56:50.675
* Yes, I know who you are *

56:50.741 --> 56:55.412
* This ride could be ours *

56:55.480 --> 57:00.518
* Mmm, just look
at those stars *

57:00.585 --> 57:03.153
* Mmm *

57:03.220 --> 57:06.991
* Just look at the stars *

57:07.057 --> 57:09.527
* Mmm *

57:09.594 --> 57:11.729
* Baby, we could be stars... *

57:11.796 --> 57:14.131
Hey.

57:14.198 --> 57:16.300
What are you
doing here?

57:16.366 --> 57:18.235
Can I ask you
a question?

57:18.302 --> 57:19.570
It's personal.

57:19.637 --> 57:21.271
Go right ahead.

57:21.338 --> 57:23.040
Why are you
still married?

57:23.107 --> 57:25.776
I mean, you never really seemed
like the marrying type, and now

57:25.843 --> 57:28.012
even though you say you're
happy, I don't think you are.

57:28.078 --> 57:30.548
I'm happy. I mean, wh-when
I got with Brenda,

57:30.615 --> 57:31.882
I decided to settle down.

57:31.949 --> 57:34.218
I mean, she's a great
mother, and I love her.

57:34.284 --> 57:35.486
See? You don't
say it right!

57:35.553 --> 57:36.954
We're gonna go through
this shit again.

57:37.021 --> 57:38.489
How was I supposed
to say it, Nikki?

57:38.556 --> 57:39.857
You're supposed to say
that you love her

57:39.924 --> 57:41.191
and you can't live
without her.

57:41.258 --> 57:42.560
You just sound indebted.

57:42.627 --> 57:44.529
You're not in love;
you're in loyal.

57:44.595 --> 57:46.230
Well, at least
I'm in something.

57:46.296 --> 57:47.632
At-at least
I have a family.

57:47.698 --> 57:48.866
Wh-What do you have?

57:48.933 --> 57:51.035
Oh, don't throw that
family shit at me.

57:51.101 --> 57:53.538
You and your wife, you don't
talk, you don't fuck.

57:53.604 --> 57:56.440
If that's what
family is, I'll wait.

57:56.507 --> 57:58.142
For what, Nikki?
What are you waiting for?

57:58.208 --> 58:00.177
For the real thing.

58:00.244 --> 58:02.012
Love.

58:02.079 --> 58:06.316
Or at least a sponsor,
but I'm not settling.

58:06.383 --> 58:09.386
You ever think about
getting a skill?

58:09.453 --> 58:13.290
Oh, I got skills.

58:13.357 --> 58:16.827
(laughs)
What are you doing here?

58:19.530 --> 58:22.166
I don't know, we're...
we're friends, right?

58:22.232 --> 58:23.534
(giggles)

58:23.601 --> 58:27.004
Yeah... We're friends.

58:27.071 --> 58:30.040
Come on, I got
to get back to work.

58:30.107 --> 58:32.176
You should come out
with me tonight.

58:32.242 --> 58:33.477
I'm not going out with you.

58:33.544 --> 58:34.612
I need you to.

58:34.679 --> 58:35.946
What for?
What's going on?

58:36.013 --> 58:37.414
Well, there's this guy,
he's really into me.

58:37.481 --> 58:38.616
I'm not sure what I
think about him,

58:38.683 --> 58:40.685
so I want you to come and
tell me what you think.

58:40.751 --> 58:42.052
After D.C.,
I have no desire

58:42.119 --> 58:43.588
to meet anymore
of your boyfriends.

58:43.654 --> 58:44.955
What, are you jealous?

58:45.022 --> 58:47.592
No. Okay, who's this guy?
What's his name?

58:47.658 --> 58:48.593
Compassion.

58:48.659 --> 58:50.194
Compassion?!

58:50.260 --> 58:52.162
Wh-What?
Compassion Fruit?

58:52.229 --> 58:53.798
Compassion... Luther King.

58:53.864 --> 58:55.432
Compassionate?
Wh-Wh...?

58:55.499 --> 58:56.667
Compassion.

58:56.734 --> 58:58.102
Just come,
it'll be a blast.

58:58.168 --> 59:00.537
You know, we'll eat onion rings
till 4:00 in the morning.

59:00.605 --> 59:03.007
It'll be like old times.

59:03.073 --> 59:05.309
So, what am I gonna
tell my wife?

59:05.375 --> 59:07.511
Um... I don't know.

59:07.578 --> 59:11.515
Just... start a fight.

59:11.582 --> 59:13.584
RICHARD:
Chicken?!

59:13.651 --> 59:16.520
Yes. What is wrong?

59:16.587 --> 59:17.788
Chicken again?

59:17.855 --> 59:19.890
We have chicken every day--
I'm tired of chicken.

59:19.957 --> 59:21.425
I thought you
liked chicken.

59:21.491 --> 59:23.127
I like it, but I don't
like it every day.

59:23.193 --> 59:25.129
I mean, I feel like I got
feathers coming out my ass.

59:25.195 --> 59:26.764
All right, this
isn't about chicken,

59:26.831 --> 59:27.898
because I know
you like chicken.

59:27.965 --> 59:29.333
No, no, no, you know what?
You know what?

59:29.399 --> 59:30.300
You know what
this is about?

59:30.367 --> 59:32.670
This is about all the other
animals out there

59:32.737 --> 59:34.605
that are dying to be
eaten that we don't eat!

59:34.672 --> 59:36.006
Now, have you ever
heard of lamb chops?

59:36.073 --> 59:37.574
Have you ever heard
of pork chops?

59:37.642 --> 59:39.276
Can a nigga get a taco?!

59:39.343 --> 59:40.577
Are you crazy?

59:40.645 --> 59:42.847
I'm losing my finger-lickin'
mind right now,

59:42.913 --> 59:44.548
eating all this chicken.

59:44.615 --> 59:46.751
I can't take it anymore.

59:46.817 --> 59:49.186
Chicken hawks don't eat
this much chicken.

59:49.253 --> 59:50.387
You know what? I'm gone.

59:50.454 --> 59:51.622
I can't take it!
I can't take it!

59:51.689 --> 59:52.690
Wh-Where you going?

59:52.757 --> 59:55.259
To get some duck!

59:58.228 --> 01:00:00.164
(train horn blares)

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:07.604
RICHARD:
What the hell is wrong with me?

01:00:07.672 --> 01:00:09.539
How could I talk to Brenda
like that?

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.241
I-I'm losing my mind.

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:13.944
I got to go home.
Okay, next stop,

01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:15.545
I'm getting off this train

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.181
and I'm gonna go home
to Brenda.

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:20.985
That's what I'm gonna do.
I am going home.

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:23.220
So, I just got off the phone
with Nikki, and, um...

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:24.722
she's running
just a little bit late,

01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:26.356
but she said
she is gonna be here.

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:27.624
Late? How late?

01:00:27.692 --> 01:00:30.060
I'm not really sure,
but, uh, she told me

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.696
to take good care of you,
and I will.

01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:33.463
So don't worry about it;
she'll be here.

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:34.665
(whispers):
Excuse me.

01:00:34.732 --> 01:00:36.533
So, sh-she's gonna
be here, right?

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.335
She's gonna be here.
Don't worry.

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:52.950
Hi. Um...

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:54.618
I'll have two
vodka martinis.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.722
Yeah...

01:01:02.727 --> 01:01:04.394
Chicken?

01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:06.396

Have you seen Nikki?!

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:23.781
No, she hasn't called,
but she will.

01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:25.582

lot of girls here.

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:05.022
Did you wear it yet?

01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:06.090
Excuse me?

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:07.591
The shirt!

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:09.726
I sold you a shirt
like, a month ago.

01:02:09.794 --> 01:02:10.861

I remember you guys.

You-You sold me the green shirt.

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:17.201
Uh, what are you doing here?

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:19.804
We're just hanging out.
We come here every week.

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:21.671
Wednesday's the best night.
What are you doing here?

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.707
Uh, I'm-I'm waiting for someone.

01:02:23.774 --> 01:02:25.375
Okay, well, we're
gonna go smoke this.

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:26.643
You wanna come?

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:28.846
Uh, I really shouldn't.
I shouldn't.

01:02:28.913 --> 01:02:30.480
BOTH:
Come on!

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:32.917
It's totally natural. I got it
from, like, this doctor I know.

01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:35.552
All right,
but just a little bit.

01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:37.254
Come on.
Come on.

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:39.890
Well, what kind of chicken
did you cook him?

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:42.059
He was just supposed to go out
to get something to eat,

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:43.493
and that was
almost four hours ago.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.029
Did you go through his pockets?

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:47.231
Y-Yes, I checked his pockets.

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:50.234
Did you find anything
on his computer?

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.669
Just a little Asian porn,
but nothing serious.

01:02:52.736 --> 01:02:57.007
I'm sure he's somewhere right
now, just clearing his head.

a table dance? *

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:01.145

* Can a nigga get a table dance?
Take it off, take it off... *

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.115
I called him.

01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:06.851
A-And he hasn't answered.

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:11.321
Richard is a responsible guy.

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:13.858
I'm sure you don't have anything
to worry about.

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:16.593
* Shake your lovey-dovey,

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.729

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:22.366
Okay, yeah.

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:23.600
You're probably right.

01:03:23.667 --> 01:03:28.072
* Even your emotions had an echo
in so much space *

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.710
* And when you're out there,
without care *

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:35.179
* Yeah, I was out of touch... *

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:36.313
Have you heard
from Nikki?!

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.082
I just got off
the phone with her.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.716
She told me to tell you
she's sorry

01:03:39.783 --> 01:03:41.418
but she's not gonna
be able to make it.

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:44.221
She's going to Miami with
some guy named Compassion.

01:03:44.288 --> 01:03:47.124
Something about
Puffy having a party.

01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:51.628
* Does that make me crazy? *

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:55.732
* Does that
make me crazy? *

01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:59.369
* Does that make me crazy? *

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:03.740
* Possibly *

01:04:03.807 --> 01:04:08.612
* Does that make me crazy? *

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:12.282
* Does that make
me crazy? *

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:17.021
* Does that make me crazy? *

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:21.258
* Possibly *

01:04:21.325 --> 01:04:25.262
* Does that make me crazy? *

01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:28.065
* Does that make me... *

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:30.334
Where have you been?

01:04:32.336 --> 01:04:33.303
I'm sorry.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.471
Fuck "sorry."

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:37.174
What kind of "food"
did you go out to get

01:04:37.241 --> 01:04:38.808
that takes five goddamn hours?

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:40.210
Brenda...

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:43.847
Brenda shit!
Don't you say my name.

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:45.649
Are you fucking somebody?

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:48.685
'Cause I swear to God, if I find
out you're fucking somebody...

01:04:48.752 --> 01:04:50.554
It's not that;
it's work. I...

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.223
I lost a client, and
they put me on probation.

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:56.026
Now I wanted to tell you, but I
didn't want you to get upset.

01:04:56.093 --> 01:04:57.661
Where have you been?

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.529
I was at the sports bar,
watching the Knick game.

01:04:59.596 --> 01:05:01.165
The game has been over.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.233
I know.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:07.071
Don't you ever do any shit
like this to me again.

01:05:07.137 --> 01:05:08.638
Do you hear me?

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:15.612
I don't know what's going on
with you, but you fix it.

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:21.351
I'm sorry.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:23.453
You should be.

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:29.059
(line ringing)

01:05:32.129 --> 01:05:33.497
Hi, this is Nikki.

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:35.799
I'm not here to take your call,
so remember:

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:39.536
Love is God, God is love. Peace.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:41.505
(voice mail beeps)

01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:44.574
Nikki? Richard.

01:05:44.641 --> 01:05:47.077
I don't know what happened
to you last night,

01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:50.080
and I don't really care.

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:54.051
I'm married. You're single.

01:05:54.118 --> 01:05:56.920
Don't call me.
Don't come by the office.

01:05:56.987 --> 01:05:59.256
Don't e-mail me. Don't fax me.

01:05:59.323 --> 01:06:03.360
Just leave me the fuck alone.

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:04.361
You got it?

01:06:04.428 --> 01:06:09.433
Just leave me the fuck alone.

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:11.168
Thank you.

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:16.706
Good night.

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:18.308
Good night,
Richard.

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:20.710
Go home, Tracy.

01:06:20.777 --> 01:06:22.179
Good night, Richard.

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:25.615
GEORGE:
Uh, Cliff, tell Russell
I can do the late lunch,

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:27.251
and then we'll talk
about that other thing.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.418
(whispers):
Okay.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:31.055
Want a ride?

01:06:31.121 --> 01:06:32.256
Yeah, sure.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.457
Come on.

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:39.763
GEORGE:
So, what
are you gonna do?

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:40.997
RICHARD:
I don't know.

01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:43.167
Brenda's so fucking
mad, I'm scared.

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:45.602
All right, buddy,
now is damage control.

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:46.870
I'll tell you what to do.

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.272
This weekend, you
get a babysitter,

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.973
take your wife out
to a nice dinner.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.441
Okay.
Right?

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:54.778
See a bullshit chick flick,
whatever she wants, and you take

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:58.648
one of these and you fuck your
wife like you're a porn star.

01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:01.351
You keep Viagra in
the glove compartment?

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:04.388
Yeah, right next
to the Altoids.

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:07.991
I may not look like Brad Pitt,
but I can fuck like him.

01:07:08.058 --> 01:07:11.061
Seriously, take this.

01:07:11.128 --> 01:07:13.330
Show Brenda a good time.

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:15.865
And stay away from Nikki.

01:07:15.932 --> 01:07:18.468
You got a good wife.

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:21.371
What are you doing?

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:25.075
I got a date with the
intern from the third floor.

01:07:25.142 --> 01:07:26.376
Goddamn!

01:07:26.443 --> 01:07:27.777
She's 23.

01:07:27.844 --> 01:07:30.347
Might need to take two.

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:34.551
And you're
happily married?

01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:36.686
17 years.

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:37.887
Good night.

01:07:37.954 --> 01:07:39.089
All right.

01:07:42.926 --> 01:07:45.362
(sultry jazz playing)

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:48.298
RICHARD:
I'm gonna take George's advice.

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:53.303
Because even though he cheats
on his wife and pops pills,

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:58.242
unlike our therapist,
he's married.

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:05.282
That was incredible.

01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:07.984
I know. Fantastic.

01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:09.786
Next time, we got
to take the kids.

01:08:09.853 --> 01:08:11.388
Absolutely;
they'd love it.

01:08:11.455 --> 01:08:12.989
How long you think
she's been out?

01:08:13.056 --> 01:08:14.524
(giggling):
Hours.

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:16.993
You know, sometimes I
think they put her to bed.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.228
Probably. Yeah.

01:08:18.295 --> 01:08:20.095
Look, I'm gonna go
check on the kids.

01:08:20.163 --> 01:08:21.898
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
I'll check on the kids.

01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:24.768
I'll get rid of Rebecca,
then I'll see you upstairs.

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:27.136
Okay.

01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:40.417
Gotta go.

01:08:40.484 --> 01:08:42.319
Wow, when'd you get back?

01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:43.553
Just got back.
Gotta go.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.522
Oh, the kids were
really great today.

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:47.191
I'm sure they are.
Gotta go.

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:48.825
They all went
to bed about 8:30.

01:08:48.892 --> 01:08:49.826
8:30! Gotta go!

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:50.993
It was really cute.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.395
They came up with
this little song.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.863
All right.
"The Gotta Go Song."

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.200
Gotta go, gotta
go, gotta go.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.703
* The look *

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:02.005
* Of love *

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:04.274
* Is in *

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:06.743
* Your eyes *

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:07.810
* A look *

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:09.345
(whispers):
Daddy loves you.

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:11.948
* Your smile *

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:14.884
* Can't disguise *

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.587
* The look *

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:21.291
* Of love *

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.729
Ooh!

01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:30.634
* Saying so much more than just
words could ever say *

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:36.171
(music stops, Brenda snores)

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:44.781
* The look *

01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:47.283
* Of love *

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.886
* Is in *

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:52.121
* Your eyes *

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.491
* A look... *

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:59.095
* Your smile can't disguise... *

01:09:59.162 --> 01:10:00.530
(panting)

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:04.734
George, we got a problem.

01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:07.404
It better be a problem.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

01:10:07.471 --> 01:10:09.639
Hey, I took that Viagra pill
you gave me,

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.575
took it around 11:00,
and I'm still hard!

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:13.009
Yeah, so what's the problem?

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:14.578
I'm still hard, George.

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.179
I've been hard for four hours.

01:10:16.246 --> 01:10:17.514
This thing won't go down!

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:18.982
Well, did you
relieve yourself?

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.350
Did I relieve myself?!

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:22.218
Yes, I've come,
like, three times,

01:10:22.286 --> 01:10:24.954
and I'm still hard, and
it's all because of you!

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:26.590
Who the hell
are you talking to?

01:10:29.259 --> 01:10:31.695
Are you talking
to some little bitch?!

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:34.097
Are you... are-are you talking
to some whore in my house?

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:36.800
No, no, no, it's
George, it's George.

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:38.067
George?!

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:40.504
What kind of down-low shit
is that?

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.806
Look, George, I gotta go.
Uh, it's not what you think.

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:43.840
Oh...

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:45.041
I did this all for you.

01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:46.343
Oh, for me?

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:48.211
I wanted to have great sex
with you,

01:10:48.278 --> 01:10:49.979
so I got a Viagra pill
from George,

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:51.415
and I came upstairs,

01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:53.216
and you were sound asleep.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:55.051
And I've just been hard
for, like, four hours.

01:10:55.118 --> 01:10:56.386
You've been hard
for four hours?

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:58.154
Honey, you gotta help...
you gotta, you gotta, you go...

01:10:58.221 --> 01:10:59.856
Don't... Keep that
thing away from me.

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:02.459
(sighs)

01:11:02.526 --> 01:11:03.493
What are you doing?

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:04.928
You know what that
commercial says.

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:06.830
Well, i-if you've taken a Viagra
and you've had an erection

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:08.865
for longer than four hours,
then you call a physician.

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:10.066
I'm calling Dr. Caruthers.

01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:11.701
It's 3:00 in
the morning.

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:13.403
I know, and he's...
and he's not in.

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.405
Okay, so-so what
are we gonna do?

01:11:15.472 --> 01:11:19.776
(sirens, horns blaring)

01:11:19.843 --> 01:11:21.945
Okay, about how much longer
before we get to the hospital?

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:23.246
About 15 minutes, sir.

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:25.014
Are you sure
you only took one?

01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:28.452
Honey, honey, if you took more
than one, just say something.

01:11:28.518 --> 01:11:30.620
I-I just took one, okay?
That's it!

01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:32.456
No, this ice
isn't working.

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:34.824
Wh-What do you mean,
the ice isn't working?!

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:38.094
How's your eyesight?
Is it clear? Is it blurry?

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:39.396
Uh... it's a little blurry.

01:11:39.463 --> 01:11:42.031
It's a little blurry.
Wh-What's that mean?

01:11:42.098 --> 01:11:44.801
Could mean nothing, or it
could mean you're going blind.

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:48.004
You're suffering from severe
priapism. I don't think
we have time to wait.

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.206
I'm gonna have to do
something about this now.

01:11:50.273 --> 01:11:51.575
RICHARD:
What's going on?!

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:53.977
I'm going to have to perform
a therapeutic aspiration.

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:55.545
Oh, my God.
You-You sure?

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:57.514
A-A-A th-thera what?!

01:11:57.581 --> 01:11:58.848
Therapeutic
aspiration.

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:01.885
I'm gonna stick this needle
into the side of your penis

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:04.020
and draw blood directly
from the cavernosa.

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:05.489
Get the fuck out of here!

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:07.424
Shh!
I promise you, it won't hurt.

01:12:07.491 --> 01:12:08.858
You'll just feel a pinch.
Brenda, Brenda!

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:09.893
Hold him down.

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:11.027
Oh... no, no!

01:12:11.094 --> 01:12:12.596
No, no!

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:13.697
Yes! Yes!
No, no, no.

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:14.964
It's not gonna hurt.
Don't worry about it.

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:15.932
Pull over, pull over.

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:17.967
No, no!

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:19.869
(scream echoing):
No!

01:12:19.936 --> 01:12:22.839
* The look *

01:12:22.906 --> 01:12:25.074
* Of love *

01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:26.843
* Is in *

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.578
* Your eyes... *

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:30.414
RICHARD:
After all my drama,

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.116
looking at other women
just made me mad.

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:36.453
Look at her.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.822
She should do that shit
at home.

01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:40.023
Fuckin' skank.

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:43.393
And look at this one--

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.094
send an e-mail, slut.

01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:47.363
Nobody wants to talk to you.

01:12:47.431 --> 01:12:48.965
(sultry laugh)

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:51.134
And look at this one.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.536
Okay, I'm not mad at her.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:54.370
I mean, who could be mad
at her?

01:12:54.438 --> 01:12:56.105
But I'm not gonna look.

01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:58.842
I'm gonna just keep on going

01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:01.210
'cause I am done
making stupid mistakes.

01:13:01.277 --> 01:13:03.513
From now on, it's family first.

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.849
* ...up the waterspout *

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:11.187
* Down came the rain
and washed the spider out *

01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:15.759
* Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain *

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:21.765
* And the itsy-bitsy spider
went up the spout again. *

01:13:21.831 --> 01:13:24.501
(applause)

01:13:33.643 --> 01:13:37.213
(gentle theme playing)

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.549
(children laughing)

01:13:41.985 --> 01:13:44.353
RICHARD:
All right, we're gonna start
with these accounts

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.322
and then work our way
to the new ones.

01:13:46.389 --> 01:13:49.058
You better order in, 'cause
we got a lot of work to do.

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:50.193
(knocking)

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:53.897
Miss me?

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:55.765
RICHARD:
If she had called,

01:13:55.832 --> 01:13:58.167
I could have hung up on her,
no problem.

01:13:58.234 --> 01:14:01.471
But seeing her in person
so close, I was defenseless.

01:14:01.538 --> 01:14:03.473
(sighs)

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:07.143
NIKKI:
I have a fiancÃ© now.

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:08.411
Sean.

01:14:08.478 --> 01:14:09.513
(chuckles)

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:11.280
Get out of here.

01:14:11.347 --> 01:14:12.248
You're getting married?

01:14:12.315 --> 01:14:13.617
Yeah.

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:16.052
Nikki Tru is
walking down the aisle?

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:18.054
I'm closing
the deal.

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:19.889
Sean is in real estate.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:20.957
What happened?

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:22.992
Uh...

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:24.360
I was at this party.

01:14:24.427 --> 01:14:25.995
I was talking to this guy--

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:27.531
I don't even remember
what we were talking about--

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:30.366
and... this little

01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:33.069
22-year-old girl walks by.

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:35.805
And he was like,
"Oh, excuse me, I got to..."

01:14:37.707 --> 01:14:40.243
Then it hit me.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:42.579
You know, I'm 32 years old.

01:14:42.646 --> 01:14:44.548
I'm the old bitch
at the club now.

01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:46.482
Think it was

01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:48.518
the first time in my life
I was talking to a man

01:14:48.585 --> 01:14:50.587
who wasn't even thinking
about fucking me.

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:55.792
So, then I met Sean.

01:14:55.859 --> 01:14:59.629
And I said to myself,
I got to make this work.

01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:01.464
So we're getting
married in June.

01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:02.899
And I want you
to meet him.

01:15:02.966 --> 01:15:04.367
Wow.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:05.535
Let me get this.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.336
You always get it.

01:15:07.403 --> 01:15:08.638
You sure?

01:15:08.705 --> 01:15:11.274
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:15:12.408 --> 01:15:15.478
(Kelly laughing, squealing)

01:15:15.545 --> 01:15:17.714
(Richard laughing)

01:15:17.781 --> 01:15:20.183
Ah! Almost got you!

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:21.685
Daddy's gonna get you.

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:23.386
(chuckles):
Hey.
Hey.

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:24.453
How was work?

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.289
Pretty good.
Uh, remember Nikki?

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:27.423
She-she came
by today.

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:28.825
Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:31.127
Yeah, she's getting
married to some guy.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:32.528
Great.

01:15:32.596 --> 01:15:33.830
Yeah, I hope
he has insurance.

01:15:33.897 --> 01:15:34.764
(chuckles)

01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:36.365
Uh, Rebecca
and Brian

01:15:36.432 --> 01:15:38.167
are waiting for you.
Thank you.

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:40.670
I'm gonna get Kelly.

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:41.838
(growls playfully)

01:15:50.179 --> 01:15:51.080
(car alarm chirps)

01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:57.486
THERAPIST:
Yeah, I am so glad

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.555
you two are making
such progress.

01:15:59.623 --> 01:16:01.190
I wasn't sure
we'd make it this far.

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:03.092
Yeah, I just decided
to stop complaining

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:04.828
about all the things
I didn't have

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:07.563
and start appreciating
the things I did.

01:16:07.631 --> 01:16:09.265
That is what I want
to hear from both of you:

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:13.269
getting along
and appreciating what you have.

01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:14.838
So, how are things physically?

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:17.841
Oh, well, um,

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:21.144
well, well, we're not
quite having sex yet.

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:23.613
Um, but-but, hey, we
are getting along,

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.983
and-and it's not all
about sex, right?

01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:29.585
Yeah, I-I,
I'm not complaining.

01:16:29.653 --> 01:16:31.387
Uh, I'm just trying
to appreciate

01:16:31.454 --> 01:16:34.624
the non-sex
that we're having.

01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:36.592
You know, you don't
have to have sex

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.561
to show somebody
you love them.

01:16:38.628 --> 01:16:41.130
I see.

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:44.133
What you writing?

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.736
Oh, nothing.

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:54.277
(slow R&B theme playing)

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:03.887
Guys, I am so sorry I'm late.

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:05.288
Something came up at the office.

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:06.322
Not a problem.

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:08.024
Richard, this is Sean.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:09.158
Sean, Richard.

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:10.960
Nikki tells me you work
at Pupkin & Langford.

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:12.495
Do you know
Matt Landis?

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:13.596
Yeah, that's my boss.

01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:15.131
Ah! I feel
sorry for you.

01:17:15.198 --> 01:17:16.065
(chuckles)

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:17.566
Well, next time
you see him,

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:19.235
tell him Sean Waters
said hello.
Yeah.

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:20.770
I wish you would've
shown up earlier.

01:17:20.837 --> 01:17:23.072
You know, I have to go and
take care of a few things.

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.708
(groans)

01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:26.442
Will you call me
when you're done?

01:17:26.509 --> 01:17:27.677
Yes.
Okay.

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:29.979
Don't forget:
Nobu at 9:00.

01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:31.380
Mm-hmm.
Don't be late.

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:33.382
I won't be.

01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:37.821
Richard, next time
you're in Malibu, look us up.

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:39.689
Bring your wife;
we'll all go out to dinner.

01:17:39.756 --> 01:17:43.292
Oh, that's a
great idea, babe.

01:17:43.359 --> 01:17:46.295
This is what
you want?

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:48.297
You're getting
married.

01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:49.298
(laughs softly)

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:51.367
Do you love him?

01:17:51.434 --> 01:17:53.202
Do I love him?

01:17:53.269 --> 01:17:54.237
(chuckles)

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:56.773
In a few years, maybe.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.107
I'm gonna be like you.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:17:59.843
You know, I'm gonna have
a nice house,

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:02.946
a nice husband,
couple kids--

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:06.182
a nice, easy, dull, boring life.

01:18:06.249 --> 01:18:07.884
And I will never again
have to live

01:18:07.951 --> 01:18:09.853
in a tiny-ass studio apartment.

01:18:09.919 --> 01:18:11.755
Come on.
Don't-don't hurt the guy.

01:18:11.821 --> 01:18:14.724
What do you care?

01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:16.625
You hurt?

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.494
Don't go there.

01:18:18.561 --> 01:18:20.496
You started it.

01:18:20.563 --> 01:18:22.231
Do I love him?

01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:23.632
(chuckles)

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.769
You know, we could be
really happy together,

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:28.905
you and me.

01:18:28.972 --> 01:18:30.807
Don't you want to be happy?

01:18:30.874 --> 01:18:33.542
My life's not about

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:35.478
what... I want.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:39.415
I hear ice cracking.

01:18:39.482 --> 01:18:41.317
Careful not to drown, Richie.

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:50.026
So, Sean leaves for
L.A. in the morning.

01:18:50.093 --> 01:18:52.762
I don't leave
till Wednesday.

01:18:52.829 --> 01:18:54.097
So why don't you
come by tomorrow

01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:56.165
and we can have a
proper good-bye?

01:18:58.701 --> 01:19:01.570
Y-You know, Nikki,
I'm-I'm not sure.

01:19:01.637 --> 01:19:03.406
I will call you
with the address,

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:05.508
and I will see
you at 2:00.

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:18.254
* *

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:22.758
Richard?

01:19:22.826 --> 01:19:24.560
Baby, you up?

01:19:24.627 --> 01:19:26.762
Hmm?

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:28.932
RICHARD:
When I woke up this morning,

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:31.700
I had no idea
what I was going to do.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:33.937
You know, some people say
life is short

01:19:34.003 --> 01:19:36.339
and that you could get hit
by a bus at any moment

01:19:36.405 --> 01:19:39.775
and that you have to live
each day like it's your last.

01:19:39.843 --> 01:19:41.277
Bullshit.

01:19:41.344 --> 01:19:42.578
Life is long.

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:45.181
You're probably not
gonna get hit by a bus,

01:19:45.248 --> 01:19:46.850
and you're gonna have to live

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:49.886
with the choices you make
for the next 50 years.

01:19:51.754 --> 01:19:53.756
RICHARD:
You know, their numbers
were pretty good last year.

01:19:53.823 --> 01:19:55.424
I always thought
that was a good buy.

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:57.060
But that's just me.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:59.662
Sure, we could
buy every day.

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:01.130
Uh, Lowenstein at Poco.

01:20:01.197 --> 01:20:03.666
He speaks Japanese,
and he's gay.

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:06.302
I only say that 'cause I took
him to Scores last Tuesday,

01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:07.837
disaster, all right?

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:09.505
See what you can do.

01:20:09.572 --> 01:20:12.241
Uh, all right, big guy wants us
all to concentrate on EuroTech.

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:15.478
And nobody talks to them
except me and Richard.

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:16.512
You got it.

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:18.447
All right.

01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:22.151
RICHARD:
When two people admit

01:20:22.218 --> 01:20:24.487
that they're attracted
to each other,

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:27.223
they're no longer in control.

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:30.426
The relationship
has to play itself out,

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:33.029
for better or for worse.

01:20:34.931 --> 01:20:36.399
Where's he going?

01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:38.534
Lunch, Tracy.

01:20:38.601 --> 01:20:43.139
* The look of love *

01:20:43.206 --> 01:20:47.110
* Is in your eyes *

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:51.881
* A look your smile *

01:20:51.948 --> 01:20:54.283
* Can't disguise. *

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.219
Thank you.

01:20:58.321 --> 01:21:00.223
Uh, excuse me...

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:03.993
Uh-huh?

01:21:05.929 --> 01:21:08.031
Do you have any condoms?

01:21:08.097 --> 01:21:09.498
Sorry, I didn't hear
what you said.

01:21:10.633 --> 01:21:12.468
Condoms.

01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:13.869
Oh, condoms! Sure.

01:21:13.937 --> 01:21:15.304
What kind you want?

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:17.073
Quiet ones.

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:19.608
Let me just
get the blue.

01:21:19.675 --> 01:21:21.444
Three-pack or 12-pack?

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:23.012
Three.

01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:24.813
12-pack is cheaper.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.049
Look... (sighs)

01:21:26.115 --> 01:21:28.217
can you just get me
some fucking condoms?

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:32.455
I don't have
change of a $20.

01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:33.556
Hey, Bob!

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:35.158
You have change
of a $20?

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:36.926
You got to have change of a $20.

01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:38.694
Bob, the man
needs his condoms!

01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:39.963
You know what?
Just keep it.

01:21:40.029 --> 01:21:40.896
Well...
Just keep it.

01:21:40.964 --> 01:21:42.098
Well...

01:21:53.042 --> 01:21:55.111
(slow, sultry theme plays)

01:22:01.784 --> 01:22:02.685
(bell dings)

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.561
Nikki?

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:14.530
NIKKI:
I'm in here.

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:23.272
You're here.

01:22:23.339 --> 01:22:26.342
I thought you might get scared
and not show up.

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:28.344
Scared?

01:22:30.446 --> 01:22:31.480
Scared of what?

01:22:31.547 --> 01:22:33.749
I don't know.

01:22:33.816 --> 01:22:36.185
Just scared.

01:22:36.252 --> 01:22:38.988
You want to help me with this?

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:40.056
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:22:40.123 --> 01:22:42.225
Sure, I'll help you.

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:46.795
Ooh, ooh. Sorry.

01:22:46.862 --> 01:22:50.233
It's all right,
just...

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:53.436
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:55.138
Okay.

01:22:59.075 --> 01:23:00.876
Just got here and you're
putting me to work.

01:23:00.943 --> 01:23:02.078
(chuckles)

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:12.521
I think... I got it.

01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:15.591
No.

01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:17.026
Not yet.

01:23:17.093 --> 01:23:18.761
But you will.

01:23:20.863 --> 01:23:22.265
You like my shoes?

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:25.834
You're wearing shoes?

01:23:25.901 --> 01:23:28.003
Yeah, I like them.

01:23:28.071 --> 01:23:31.407
You mind if I
keep them on?

01:23:31.474 --> 01:23:33.542
Go right ahead.

01:23:42.051 --> 01:23:44.187
What are you doing
all the way over there?

01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:46.122
Thought you weren't scared.

01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:48.257
I'm just taking it all in.

01:23:50.826 --> 01:23:52.328
You look real good, Nikki.

01:23:52.395 --> 01:23:55.931
Why don't you take it all in
a little closer?

01:23:55.998 --> 01:23:58.501
I'm not gonna bite.

01:23:58.567 --> 01:24:00.603
("Tired of You"
by Foo Fighters playing)

01:24:06.142 --> 01:24:07.776
I'm gonna miss you.

01:24:07.843 --> 01:24:10.613
* I can be your liar *

01:24:10.679 --> 01:24:11.814
Gonna miss you, too.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.983
* I can be your bearer *

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.686
So what are you waiting for?

01:24:20.956 --> 01:24:24.260
* Sick and uninspired *

01:24:24.327 --> 01:24:30.133
* By the diamonds in your fire *

01:24:30.199 --> 01:24:33.169
* Burning like a flame *

01:24:33.236 --> 01:24:35.304
* Inside of you *

01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:44.413
* But is this just desire
or the truth? *

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:49.785
Wait, wait, wait.

01:24:49.852 --> 01:24:52.855
Take your clothes off.

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:57.326
* Shame on me for the blues *

01:24:57.393 --> 01:25:02.165
* Another one returned
that I'll never use *

01:25:05.401 --> 01:25:09.938
* I won't go
getting tired of you *

01:25:10.005 --> 01:25:11.574
What?

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.542
* I won't go getting
tired of you *

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:14.443
What?

01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:19.114
* I'm not getting tired *

01:25:19.182 --> 01:25:20.749
Richard?

01:25:20.816 --> 01:25:24.587
* I won't go
getting tired of you *

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:26.489
* I won't go *

01:25:26.555 --> 01:25:27.523
What?

01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:28.757
No, it's okay.

01:25:28.824 --> 01:25:29.758
Sweetheart, it's okay.

01:25:29.825 --> 01:25:30.926
S... What are you...?

01:25:30.993 --> 01:25:31.994
Richard, stop it!

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.596
No, st... What
are you doing?!

01:25:33.662 --> 01:25:35.698
* I won't go
getting tired of you *

01:25:35.764 --> 01:25:38.267
Richard! Richard!

01:25:38.334 --> 01:25:42.070
RICHARD:
Life is about choice.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:44.006
We're all the sum
of our choices.

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:46.375
And most of them
are made for us.

01:25:46.442 --> 01:25:49.212
You can't choose
when you're born.

01:25:49.278 --> 01:25:51.214
You can't choose
where you're born.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.116
You can't choose your family.

01:25:54.183 --> 01:25:56.552
You can't even choose
who you love.

01:25:56.619 --> 01:25:59.622
But you can choose
how you love.

01:26:02.291 --> 01:26:04.793
* Of *

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:06.229
* Of you. *

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:12.801
(song ends)

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:25.748
Richard.

01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:26.882
Are you okay?

01:26:26.949 --> 01:26:28.484
Yeah, yeah,
I-I'm fine.

01:26:28.551 --> 01:26:30.286
Oh, honey, what are you
doing home so early?

01:26:30.353 --> 01:26:31.520
Where are the kids?

01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:33.889
I just dropped them off
at my mother's house.

01:26:33.956 --> 01:26:35.291
Hey, you're
scaring me.

01:26:35.358 --> 01:26:37.893
What... What's
going on?

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.329
I missed you.

01:26:40.396 --> 01:26:43.198
I miss you, too.

01:26:43.266 --> 01:26:44.667
What's happening
to us?

01:26:44.733 --> 01:26:47.470
I don't know.

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:48.704
I feel like it's my fault

01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:50.573
that we're not as close
as we used to be.

01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:53.609
Ah, it's-it's not your fault.
It's my fault.

01:26:53.676 --> 01:26:56.345
I'm not doing everything
I'm supposed to do.

01:26:56.412 --> 01:26:57.880
Is it too late?

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.848
I don't know.

01:26:59.915 --> 01:27:00.949
(R&B music playing)

01:27:01.016 --> 01:27:02.251
You know, baby,

01:27:02.318 --> 01:27:03.486
I just want to tell you

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:06.822
how sorry I am
for being so cold.

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:09.091
It's not like I don't like
being married.

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:10.626
It's just that sometimes
it feels like

01:27:10.693 --> 01:27:13.329
the walls are closing in on me.

01:27:13.396 --> 01:27:14.630
Now, hold on one minute.

01:27:14.697 --> 01:27:16.699
Whatever you did,
you did to yourself.

01:27:16.765 --> 01:27:18.133
'Cause I been
running around here,

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.668
trying to make
a nice life for us,

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:21.770
taking care of the kids,
being Everywoman.

01:27:21.837 --> 01:27:22.671
But lately...

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:25.908
* You've been cold as ice *

01:27:25.974 --> 01:27:27.175
* So cold. *

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:28.243
So have you.

01:27:28.311 --> 01:27:29.445
Oh, grow up.

01:27:29.512 --> 01:27:30.846
You know it's true.

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:31.880
Look...

01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:35.351
I know none of this is easy,
but I miss us.

01:27:35.418 --> 01:27:37.353
I miss what we had.

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:39.788
I miss it to the core,
and I just need to know...

01:27:39.855 --> 01:27:44.126
* How come we don't
fuck anymore? *

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:45.561
You the one on strike!

01:27:45.628 --> 01:27:48.096
* It's been a
mighty long time *

01:27:48.163 --> 01:27:50.699
You out of your fucking mind!

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:51.867
Careful, nigga.

01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:53.001
Baby, I still want you.

01:27:53.068 --> 01:27:55.070
And I've wanted you for so long.

01:27:55.137 --> 01:27:57.205
But every time I touch you...

01:27:57.272 --> 01:28:01.810
* You act like I did
something wrong *

01:28:01.877 --> 01:28:03.879
* No, I don't *
Yes, you do!

01:28:03.946 --> 01:28:05.280
I don't want to leave.

01:28:05.348 --> 01:28:06.749
* Neither do I *

01:28:06.815 --> 01:28:08.283
I still want you!

01:28:08.351 --> 01:28:09.452
* I'm gonna cry *

01:28:09.518 --> 01:28:11.019
Where are the kids?!

01:28:11.086 --> 01:28:12.355
I told you,
they're gone.

01:28:12.421 --> 01:28:15.591
* In that case,
we should be making love *

01:28:15.658 --> 01:28:18.327
* All night long,
all night long *

01:28:18.394 --> 01:28:21.364
* Hee... *

01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:22.431
* All *

01:28:22.498 --> 01:28:27.336
BOTH:
* Night long... *

01:28:27.403 --> 01:28:30.238
(saxophone wailing)

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:32.240
RICHARD:
When I told Nikki that my life

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:35.110
wasn't about what I wanted,
I lied.

01:28:35.177 --> 01:28:36.945
I'm not that unselfish.

01:28:37.012 --> 01:28:39.047
I know exactly what I want.

01:28:39.114 --> 01:28:40.549
I want a woman that'll not only

01:28:40.616 --> 01:28:42.585
fight with me,
but who'll fight for me.

01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:44.353
A woman I can go to war with,

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:46.955
who'll drag me
and my kids out alive.

01:28:47.022 --> 01:28:49.257
A woman that can see
the good in me

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:50.626
when I can't even
see it in myself.

01:28:50.693 --> 01:28:54.430
You know, Nikki was
a great fantasy,

01:28:54.497 --> 01:28:56.632
but in reality...

01:28:56.699 --> 01:28:57.966
I think I love my wife.

01:28:58.033 --> 01:29:03.439
* Yeah, yeah *

01:29:03.506 --> 01:29:05.508
* He loves his wife *

01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:08.577
* He loves his wife *

01:29:08.644 --> 01:29:11.614
* He ain't never gonna
do no wrong no more *

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.281
* No more *

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:15.183
* Yes, he loves his wife *

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:16.819
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:29:16.885 --> 01:29:18.921
* No matter how fine
that other girl is *

01:29:18.987 --> 01:29:19.788
* Oh, no *

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:21.189
* He's gonna
leave her alone *

01:29:21.256 --> 01:29:22.157
* Leave her alone *

01:29:22.224 --> 01:29:23.492
* He loves his wife *

01:29:23.559 --> 01:29:25.127
* Loves his wife *
* Loves his wife *

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.128
* Ooh *

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.730
* Loves his wife *

01:29:27.796 --> 01:29:30.032
* Loves his wife,
loves his wife *

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:34.036
* Yeah, yeah *

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.738
* He loves his wife *

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:37.906
* And the babies, too. *

01:29:37.973 --> 01:29:38.907
(song ends)

01:29:41.577 --> 01:29:43.612
(whimsical, funky theme playing)

01:29:54.490 --> 01:29:56.592
* *

01:30:07.503 --> 01:30:09.638

* *
