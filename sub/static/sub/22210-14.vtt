00:02.127 --> 00:06.087
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.173 --> 00:09.166
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:12.218
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.304 --> 00:14.796
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.432 --> 00:17.219
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.309 --> 00:20.097
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:23.100
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.315 --> 00:25.682
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

00:25.984 --> 00:28.146
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.363 --> 00:30.774
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:30.864 --> 00:32.195
<i>Twelve markers, twelve metas.</i>

00:32.281 --> 00:35.025
Your body's deteriorating
faster than the chair can handle.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.576
I didn't just take Dominic's body,
I took his ability.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.120
<i>Sylbert Rundine
can shrink objects</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:40.788
<i>and return them to original size.</i>

00:40.874 --> 00:42.490
<i>Deacon controls technology.</i>

00:42.584 --> 00:44.496
<i>Becky Sharpe can manipulate luck.</i>

00:44.586 --> 00:45.747
<i>There was nothing keeping him</i>

00:45.837 --> 00:48.045
<i>from going in the meta-wing
and absorbing the powers.</i>

00:48.131 --> 00:50.544
You should be able to change
into anyone you can think of.

00:50.634 --> 00:51.624
How's this?

00:51.718 --> 00:53.505
<i>- I believe you're looking for me.</i>
- It's Ralph.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.712
<i>Barry Allen is hereby
released immediately.</i>

00:55.806 --> 00:58.014
He only wants the bus metas,
he wants their powers.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.057
Why is everyone looking at me
like I'm a dead man?

01:18.537 --> 01:20.324
Addie, hey, what's going on?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.327
- I think you should talk to Cap.
- About what?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.495
Just go see him, Allen.

01:26.670 --> 01:27.660
Okay.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.751
<i>...will no longer tolerate</i>

01:30.841 --> 01:32.753
<i>the behavior that the previous
administration practiced.</i>

01:32.843 --> 01:34.004
Addie said you wanted to see me.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.380
- Yeah. Shut the door.
<i>- I promise you.</i>

01:35.470 --> 01:38.838
<i>We will root out all corruption
at all levels...</i>

01:38.932 --> 01:41.265
<i>...and restore your faith
in public servants.</i>

01:42.519 --> 01:46.308
<i>The name Van Buren is a name
that has always stood for integrity.</i>

01:46.523 --> 01:47.809
<i>I may be the mayor...</i>

01:48.233 --> 01:50.350
We've got a problem
that I'm not sure how to fix.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.560
All right.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.645
Some people don't think
you should be back on the force.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.859
- Because of DeVoe?
- Hmm.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.402
I was cleared of all charges.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.738
I didn't do anything.
I mean, he is alive.

01:59.828 --> 02:03.071
I know, and he's been cooperating.
Coming in, answering questions.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.372
So, what's the problem?

02:04.458 --> 02:08.042
Look, people nowadays
will believe anything.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.828
Fake news, social media.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.130
Allegations are treated as facts.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.132
But DeVoe being alive,

02:16.345 --> 02:18.678
showing up in the courtroom
at your appeal hearing?

02:18.930 --> 02:21.547
Some people in Central City
don't buy it's actually him.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.891
- Who do they think it was?
- Who the hell knows?

02:23.977 --> 02:25.809
But we live in a city
full of meta-humans.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.808
It's a conspiracy theorist's dream.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.768
So, what does this mean?

02:30.442 --> 02:31.432
Are you firing me?

02:31.735 --> 02:32.851
Not firing.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.776
But I have been asked to request
that you take a leave of absence.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.191
By whom?

02:44.831 --> 02:46.447
Thinks it will be easier for everyone.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.283
Restoring the faith and all that.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.413
For how long?

02:49.628 --> 02:50.618
Indefinitely.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.498
Look, Barry.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.623
If you want me to fight
this thing, I'll do what I can,

02:56.385 --> 02:59.128
but this new mayor, she's got a lot
to prove since the Bellows' debacle.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.005
When do you think I can come back?

03:02.391 --> 03:05.054
When everyone believes DeVoe
is really alive and well.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.851
It's not permanent, is it?

03:15.278 --> 03:16.689
Well, he said it was indefinite.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.897
They wouldn't have given you
your ID back if it was for good.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.982
I mean, maybe this is
for the best, Barry.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.159
I mean, you need to prove
that DeVoe is still alive

03:23.245 --> 03:24.952
and you can do that now as the Flash.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.199
Yeah, maybe.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.780
How are we doing with him by the way?

03:27.874 --> 03:30.617
We know that we still have
four bus-metas left to find.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.327
And that DeVoe has absorbed the powers

03:32.421 --> 03:35.755
of Kilg%re, Hazard, Black Bison,
Brainstorm and Dwarfstar.

03:35.841 --> 03:36.957
Fallout is safe with Tracy.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.167
But the Weeper is MIA.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.342
DeVoe must have him.

03:40.429 --> 03:41.636
Well, that just leaves Ralph.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.339
Ralph is safe with us,
but the other four metas aren't.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.224
DeVoe will absolutely kill them
and take their powers.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.642
But why does he need their powers?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.186
I can't figure out his endgame.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.605
I don't know. I just know that
these last four metas are the key.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.104
- That's why we need to find them.
- Find them we will.

03:55.986 --> 03:56.976
Where have you guys been?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.653
A little home away from home,
otherwise known as the bus depot.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.276
Thought I'd show Cisco here

04:01.366 --> 04:04.359
an old PI trick I learned
from my mentor, Columbo.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.575
Lost and found box from meta bus 405.

04:07.664 --> 04:08.780
Question for the room.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.617
How did I get stuck doing
the buddy-system thing with Ralph?

04:11.710 --> 04:14.669
It's the best way
to keep Ralph safe, Cisco.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.418
Yeah, it's the best way
to keep Ralph safe, Cisco.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.250
Oh, clearly, you've never had
to stay over at an apartment

04:20.343 --> 04:24.087
that uses neon beer signs for lamps
and a kitchen sink for a shower.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.594
Ralph, I love you,
but you sleep on a futon.

04:26.683 --> 04:27.799
Futon is not that bad.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.100
It is when it's damp.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.176
Why is it damp?

04:30.645 --> 04:31.931
I sweat a lot when I sleep.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.311
You're nasty.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.390
Huh.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.568
Hey, my retainer.
I've been looking for this.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.686
Retainer.

04:41.990 --> 04:42.980
Okay. You've made your point.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.862
Not that the point needed to be made.
I'll take the next shift.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.159
You're a good man, Barry Allen.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.153
Really, who uses CDs anymore?

04:50.665 --> 04:52.748
A musician trying to catch their break.

04:54.586 --> 04:55.918
Izzy Bowin.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.256
Ugh.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.718
Country. Music's tone-deaf step-child.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.761
All right. You remember anyone
on the bus with a fiddle?

05:05.847 --> 05:08.715
There was a guy with a cowboy hat on
sitting behind me.

05:08.850 --> 05:09.886
Maybe it was him?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.717
Boy, I sure wish we had
a way of finding out.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.439
Izzy Bowin.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.529
Izzy, you wanna give us
a little mic check?

05:32.541 --> 05:34.874
<i>Check one. Check, check one, two.</i>

05:37.712 --> 05:39.829
Okay, well, it's a her, not a him.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.085
And she's playing
a gig at The Busted Saddle.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.167
All right. Ralph, let's go.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.423
No, no way. I hate country music.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.013
Well, buddy system.
It's my turn. Come on.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.715
If you insist.

06:22.841 --> 06:23.831
She's good.

06:24.926 --> 06:28.966
She's improving,
but she lacks refinement.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.764
So you're not impressed by her at all?

06:33.268 --> 06:36.261
The resting face of my current visage

06:36.354 --> 06:40.143
may be more pleasant
than the one I used to display.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.191
But I assure you,

06:42.277 --> 06:45.111
this is not the look of a man

06:45.196 --> 06:47.984
awed by symphonic greatness.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.532
Clifford. Clifford.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.571
This body, it's deteriorating.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.196
Rapidly.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.824
The additional dark matter
in your system

06:58.919 --> 07:01.377
from each of your new powers
is wearing down your host.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.206
It's draining too much
of this body's new energy.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.592
Then I must move into the next one.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.044
But you said that
Izzy Bowin wasn't ready,

07:10.138 --> 07:11.470
that we needed to find another.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.260
We don't have time.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.012
We must act now.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.515
We may be too late.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.900
- Izzy Bowin?
- That's me.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.156
My name is Barry Allen.
I'm with C.C.P.D...

07:38.583 --> 07:39.699
Is that a label?

07:40.001 --> 07:41.788
- Um...
- Maybe on another Earth.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.588
Okay. Well, you want an autograph
or a phone number or something?

07:47.050 --> 07:49.713
Uh... No, no, nothing like that.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.591
Okay. If it ain't business,
and it ain't pleasure,

07:52.681 --> 07:55.173
then we got nothin' left
to talk about now, do we?

07:55.725 --> 07:56.715
Oh.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.602
- Do it again next week. Great work.
- Thank you.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.687
Okay, I'm sorry. Let me explain. Um...

08:07.988 --> 08:08.978
Uh...

08:10.073 --> 08:12.611
Someone very smart

08:13.118 --> 08:16.327
and very dangerous is coming after you.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.403
Me?

08:18.707 --> 08:19.697
Yeah.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.793
Okay, now, why in the name of God

08:24.879 --> 08:27.166
would anybody dangerous
be coming after me?

08:27.257 --> 08:28.589
Because you have powers.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.626
Four months ago, you were
on Central City bus 405.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.799
That bus got showered with dark matter

08:34.889 --> 08:36.471
and made everyone on it a meta-human.

08:37.142 --> 08:40.510
Now the person responsible for doing
that wants those powers for themself.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.979
Okay, and let me guess.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.852
You boys are here to protect me?

08:46.693 --> 08:47.683
Something like that.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.569
Look, we can explain more later,

08:50.655 --> 08:51.771
but now, we just need you
to come with us.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.773
Oh, no. That's not necessary.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.826
My daddy bailed,
Mama bailed not long after.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.325
I have been looking out
for myself my entire life.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.949
This time, it's different. You can't.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.750
Please, we need to go.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.202
I ain't going anywhere
with either of you.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.832
I think you should reconsider that.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.085
I don't give a damn what you think.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.426
I guess now we know what her power is.

09:23.730 --> 09:24.937
- What?
- What?

09:26.316 --> 09:27.932
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:32.697 --> 09:33.687
You two are lucky.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.525
Barry, your ear's almost healed.
And Dibny, yours just stretched.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.572
I still can't hear all that great.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.662
Consider that a blessing in disguise.
Less twang in your future.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.955
Give it an hour, you'll be fine.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.704
So, Izzy Bowin can control music.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.080
More like sound waves.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.627
Soundwave. That's a great name.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.372
It would be, if it wasn't already
taken by a Transformer.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.456
Mmm.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.710
Okay, well, it looks like billions
of tiny shrapnel ripped through this.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.923
Exactly. Sound is just the force
of billions of tiny gas molecules

10:00.016 --> 10:01.348
colliding into one another.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.721
So if you can harness
an amplified kinetic energy, you get...

10:03.812 --> 10:05.019
Molecular shrapnel.

10:05.688 --> 10:06.678
Okay. We've got to keep searching.

10:06.773 --> 10:07.809
If we can't track her down soon,

10:07.899 --> 10:09.515
she's gonna fall right
into DeVoe's hands.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.812
Speaking of tracking people down,

10:11.903 --> 10:13.644
when is Harry getting back from Earth-2?

10:19.160 --> 10:20.446
DA Cecile Horton.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.824
Harry, hey. When did you
get back from your Earth?

10:22.914 --> 10:24.780
Just got back. I'm getting
myself a little pick-me-up.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.035
You and me both, kid.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.451
- Okay. Good talk.
- Yeah.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.713
Actually, I don't think
that pregnant people

10:32.799 --> 10:33.789
are supposed to consume caffeine.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.005
Uh, yeah. Doctor says
one cup a day is fine.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.678
And Lord knows I need it...

10:40.014 --> 10:42.301
I need it more than
you can possibly imagine.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.886
Apparently. Must be exhausting.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.684
It is. He's keeping me up all night.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.597
He? I thought Allen said
you're having a girl.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.148
Yeah. I'm not talking about the baby.
I'm talking about Joe.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.770
Joe is keeping me up.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.486
Harry, come here.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.402
My newfound ability
to hear people's thoughts.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.821
- Yeah. I can hear...
- Oh. I thought...

11:05.123 --> 11:09.333
Joe, his thoughts. I can hear them
while he's asleep, all night long.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.955
- You hear his dreams.
- Yup.

11:11.087 --> 11:15.001
And they're crazy and fast
and, oh, so very loud.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.209
It is like living in the middle
of an action movie, Harry.

11:18.887 --> 11:22.380
I love Joe West with all my heart,
but I'm telling you I just can't...

11:22.473 --> 11:24.305
I'm sorry.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.224
I can't take it anymore.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.302
Yeah, that sucks to hear, Cecile Horton.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.137
- Yes, it does.
- Okay.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.565
Actually, I might be able
to build something

11:33.651 --> 11:34.732
that could help you with that.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.152
- Yeah.
- Oh, Harry, thank you.

11:40.825 --> 11:41.906
Satellite's been running all day,

11:41.993 --> 11:44.451
but it's still not picking up
any irregular sound variances.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.704
I checked the city. I can't find her.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.201
- Babe, you checked the whole city?
- Yeah.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.619
Look, we have to find her
before DeVoe. Her life's on the line.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.204
She had another gig this week.
I doubt she'd skip town.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.506
How would Dibny PI suggest we find her?

11:57.717 --> 12:01.461
Well, since you asked.
Has anyone checked her website?

12:01.804 --> 12:04.171
"Has anyone
checked her website?"

12:04.265 --> 12:06.177
Dibs, of course,
we've checked her website.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.895
No one has checked her website? Iris!

12:11.981 --> 12:14.849
Yeah, I'm on it. I'm looking now. Um...

12:16.819 --> 12:17.855
Guys, she's still in town.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.812
"I just picked up
the first run of my next single.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.693
Love the geniuses at Saloon Sounds."

12:22.325 --> 12:23.987
All right, Ralph. Take two.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.489
- Cisco, we might need Vibe's help.
- Giddy up.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.780
Come on. Let's go, we're in a hurry.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.624
Izzy Bowin?

12:32.710 --> 12:33.917
We need you to come with us.

12:34.003 --> 12:34.993
Flash?

12:35.630 --> 12:36.620
You're in danger.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.542
I know. Everybody keeps telling me that.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.795
You're gonna keep hearing it
until it sinks in.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.000
You just have to trust us.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.927
We're not gonna hurt you,
but we know someone who will.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.546
Who is gonna hurt me?

12:45.640 --> 12:46.926
I am.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.605
You all came to warn me about her?

12:56.484 --> 12:57.565
DeVoe.

12:59.362 --> 13:00.728
Hello, Flash.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.150
You're gonna leave Izzy alone.

13:04.033 --> 13:08.152
You know, you really don't learn
from our past encounters, do you?

13:09.163 --> 13:12.782
You're not smart enough to stop me
from getting what I want.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.206
And what I want now is her.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.500
That's not gonna happen.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.128
It's three against one, genius.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.963
Check your math, Vibe.
It's three against six.

13:27.557 --> 13:31.426
Though, I doubt I'll need to use
all of my powers against you.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.276
You stay away from me!

14:01.007 --> 14:02.248
You just hurt DeVoe.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.583
Who the hell is DeVoe?

14:12.435 --> 14:15.678
So you're telling me
that this three-foot tall chick

14:15.772 --> 14:18.810
that tried to kill me is actually this

14:19.150 --> 14:20.732
Clifford DeVoe?

14:20.985 --> 14:22.851
Yeah, 100% dude.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.523
Mmm-hmm. DeVoe is transferring his
consciousness to the other bodies

14:26.616 --> 14:28.403
of all the other people
who were on the bus

14:28.493 --> 14:29.859
and got their powers with you.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.989
Wait. This little girl wants my body?

14:32.538 --> 14:33.949
It's why we were trying to protect you.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.957
DeVoe has already taken
most of his targets.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.787
No. This ain't happening. Not now.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.626
I only got my powers recently.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.008
And now it's like
I've got a deeper connection

14:46.094 --> 14:48.131
to my music than I've ever had.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.635
I'm about to record
the rest of my new album...

14:51.724 --> 14:54.091
Izzy, your album can wait.
This threat is real.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.976
So is my big break.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.223
Do you have any idea
how hard I've had to work for this?

15:01.025 --> 15:02.106
I left my home.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.564
I lost friends and good men.

15:04.654 --> 15:08.398
And I have put up with more crap
than you could imagine,

15:08.491 --> 15:10.232
so that one day I'd get my dream.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.321
And now you're telling me

15:12.412 --> 15:15.621
that some pint-sized lunatic
is just gonna take it all away?

15:16.457 --> 15:19.416
Which is exactly why we want you
to stay here at S.T.A.R. Labs.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.336
Why? You're all gonna
protect me or something?

15:24.132 --> 15:25.122
We're gonna train you.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.628
- We are?
- We are?

15:27.885 --> 15:29.968
Guys, her powers weakened DeVoe.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.220
Izzy, that makes you
our best shot at stopping him.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.218
No, no. This is all too much.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.803
I don't even know who you people are.

15:36.561 --> 15:37.927
We don't have time for this.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.594
Flash!

15:42.775 --> 15:44.141
You're that guy from before.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.646
Yeah. Barry Allen.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.477
And so are you, aren't you?

15:48.406 --> 15:51.899
Yeah. Ralph. Ralph Dibny.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.406
I'm Cisco. Cisco Ramon.
It's nice to meet you.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.239
Okay, thank you.
Look, look, I don't need training.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.332
Especially from you.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.910
All I need is my life back.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.375
I don't know, guys.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.708
I kinda feel like if I just
followed her into that hallway

16:08.801 --> 16:11.464
and just gave her one of those
"hey, look" inspirational talks,

16:11.554 --> 16:12.795
I could probably get her to stay.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.554
Then what are you still doing here?

16:14.849 --> 16:17.091
Sorry, I don't know if you drew
straws for this stuff or something.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.642
- No, go!
- Okay.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.808
I'd watch out if I were you.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.940
Sometimes, killer robots
come out of there.

16:29.614 --> 16:30.821
Keep walking, Stretch.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.991
I don't talk to creeps in dark hallways
dressed in purple leather.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.944
It's actually more of a mauve.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.158
And I'm not a creep.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.241
Look, Izzy, I know how you're feeling.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.044
The day you got your powers,
I was on the same bus.

16:46.506 --> 16:50.591
So that evil chipmunk,
she wants to kill me, too.

16:51.594 --> 16:54.712
Please. I think I'd remember
seeing you on my bus.

16:56.182 --> 17:00.347
Actually, I was kind of
big-boned back then.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.979
I was on a strict diet of gin,
doughnuts, and regret,

17:04.357 --> 17:05.689
but I got another shot at it.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.107
And I worked my tight butt off,

17:07.193 --> 17:09.856
and now I'm the hottest
superhero in town.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.019
Please.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.897
My life, it's never been better.
Kinda like yours.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.280
Yeah, but aren't you
afraid of losing it all?

17:17.369 --> 17:18.952
Yeah, I am.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.371
Which is why I'm a part of this team.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.244
You said that your family bailed on you,

17:24.335 --> 17:27.999
so I can understand why you wouldn't
trust someone to look out for you,

17:28.089 --> 17:29.921
but, Izzy, I can tell you firsthand

17:30.091 --> 17:33.755
that these amazing weirdos,
they won't bail.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.795
They created a buddy system for me.

17:38.266 --> 17:43.182
And if you'll stay,
they'll keep you safe.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.054
I promise.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.907
So, who's gonna be my buddy then?

17:59.704 --> 18:03.618
I may have to pull some strings,
but I will see if I'm available.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.621
Subject 9's sonic powers

18:10.715 --> 18:13.298
accelerated the deterioration
of your internal organs.

18:13.634 --> 18:17.173
She merely disrupted
my atrial flutter and bradycardia.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.550
This body is nearly drained anyway.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.883
Its palliation is a waste of time.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.970
I need these biometric scans
to fully assess your ailments.

18:26.063 --> 18:29.056
Then you should have
built this to work faster.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.026
I'm doing all I can.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.196
Yet, you achieved precisely

18:36.282 --> 18:37.523
the opposite!

18:39.452 --> 18:41.990
I couldn't idly stand by
and watch you be injured.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.786
Your plan was failing.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.079
Is it possible that
the repeated transference

18:48.169 --> 18:49.831
has affected your cognitive functioning?

18:53.466 --> 18:58.052
There is nothing wrong with my mind.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.730
Next time, I will keep a level head.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.653
Izzy, this will help
focus your powers.

19:18.491 --> 19:22.155
Well, this ain't much help in a fight
unless you're dueling the devil.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.486
Don't think of it like a weapon.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.951
Just do what you've
always been dreaming to do.

19:28.459 --> 19:29.449
Make your own sound.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.586
You my new target, Stretch?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.592
Yeah, 'cause I don't break so easy.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.971
Please.
You're built like a twig.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.342
DA Cecile Horton, you look tired.

20:24.432 --> 20:27.095
Yeah. That's 'cause I am tired.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.720
This thing, it doesn't work.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.803
It works because I built it,

20:30.896 --> 20:32.762
and "this thing," as you
so inelegantly put it,

20:32.857 --> 20:34.689
happens to be a mental activity dampener

20:34.775 --> 20:37.392
that is 10 pounds of cerebellum-proof,

20:37.486 --> 20:40.775
anti-telepathy somno-steel.
Thank you very much.

20:41.073 --> 20:45.784
Yeah, that's the problem.
It is 10 pounds of that stuff.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.819
- So?
- Okay.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.867
Okay.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.161
And?

20:56.839 --> 20:59.877
I can't sleep like this,

20:59.967 --> 21:02.175
Harry, does this look
comfortable to you?

21:02.553 --> 21:06.342
I was pulling state-of-the-art
technology out of my ass

21:06.432 --> 21:07.843
to help you with your problem.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.676
I forgot to make things
"comfortable" for you.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.682
Are you kidding me?
You know what else I forgot?

21:12.772 --> 21:13.762
I guess I also forgot,

21:13.856 --> 21:15.597
while I was coming up
with generational breakthrough

21:15.691 --> 21:17.432
in vibrational brainwave theory,

21:17.526 --> 21:19.438
that I was working
for the Princess and the Pea.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.771
Stop it! Stop. Put it down.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.154
Harry, put it down.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.700
Okay, just...

21:34.126 --> 21:35.742
What the hell is wrong with you?

21:35.878 --> 21:36.914
I'm frustrated.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.747
- You're frustrated?
- Yes.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.878
You start yelling at me
and throwing things.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.048
It's like every awful thought
that you have

21:46.138 --> 21:49.848
just comes pouring out of your mouth.
Totally unfiltered. I don't even...

21:51.811 --> 21:54.929
Is this normal behavior for you?

21:55.231 --> 21:56.392
Sometimes behavior.

21:56.690 --> 22:00.730
Okay. If I wanna hear
a grown man scream like a child,

22:00.820 --> 22:02.561
I will go home
and listen to Joe's stress dreams

22:02.655 --> 22:04.112
about showing up naked to math class.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.941
- Ew.
- Just take your thing, Harry.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.776
- See you later.
- It's heavy.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.703
You missed. Again.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.961
Well, what do you expect, Ralph?
I've been doing this all day.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.132
I need a water break.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.681
- Maybe we should call it a night.
- Not yet.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.804
She's barely landed
another shot on Ralph.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.226
She needs more time, Bar.

22:35.312 --> 22:38.771
She held her own against DeVoe.
Totally on raw instinct.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.190
Beginner's luck?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.480
I mean, it took months to train Ralph.

22:42.570 --> 22:43.560
We don't have months.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.944
Look, this is our chance
to get ahead for once.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.740
If DeVoe shows up again,

22:51.328 --> 22:52.318
we have to be ready.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.164
All right, Ralph. I'm taking over.

22:56.959 --> 22:59.667
Uh, thanks, Bar, but we kinda
got this covered over here.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.537
Gotta push her, Ralph.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.499
All right, Izzy. I wanna see
if you can hit a moving target.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.127
- Okay.
- You're ready?

23:16.604 --> 23:17.594
Nice.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.637
Take it up a few notches.

23:31.785 --> 23:32.946
Ow!

23:33.454 --> 23:34.786
Barry!

23:35.039 --> 23:36.029
Whoa.

23:55.768 --> 23:56.758
How's Izzy?

23:57.895 --> 24:00.103
She just needs a couple stitches,
and she'll be okay.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.682
Ralph won't leave her side.
I think he might really like her.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.813
Ralph shouldn't be bothering her at all.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.860
I mean, she needs to stay focused.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.108
Izzy might be scrappy,

24:10.199 --> 24:11.986
but, you know,
it's her first day training

24:12.076 --> 24:13.692
with powers
she's had for a little while.

24:13.786 --> 24:14.947
I know.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.536
Barry, don't you think
you're being a little hard on her?

24:16.622 --> 24:18.830
No. I'm trying to teach her
how to protect herself.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.411
No. It seems like you're trying
to turn her into a hero.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.835
And that path just
isn't meant for everyone, Barry.

24:23.921 --> 24:26.334
I mean, Izzy's just trying to survive.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.540
Well, she's not going to,
if I don't push her.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.259
You think this is the only way
to fight DeVoe?

24:31.553 --> 24:33.715
It's not just about that.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.506
Iris, you weren't at Iron Heights.

24:36.600 --> 24:40.435
I saw up close what DeVoe did
to Becky. To all of them.

24:40.521 --> 24:41.511
They...

24:41.855 --> 24:46.850
And I couldn't do anything except
just stand and watch it happen.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.898
DeVoe is ruthless.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.865
He is not gonna stop until he's
taken her powers and her life.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.281
He's not gonna go easy on her,
so neither can I.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.123
I'm so sorry that
you had to experience that,

25:05.212 --> 25:07.750
but Barry, we can't be
ruthless like DeVoe.

25:08.298 --> 25:12.042
He is willing to sacrifice
anyone and anything.

25:13.637 --> 25:16.505
Just remember that the next time
you're pushing too hard, okay?

25:17.766 --> 25:20.429
You, of all people, know that
heroes aren't made overnight.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.526
Joe's not here.

25:30.904 --> 25:31.894
Why would I want to talk to Joe?

25:31.989 --> 25:34.606
I kinda figured after
our last conversation

25:34.700 --> 25:36.566
you would never want
to speak to me again.

25:36.994 --> 25:37.984
That's fine.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.950
You do know
I can hear your thoughts, right?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.030
Right.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.411
No, Harry, I'm not gonna
yell at you again.

25:44.501 --> 25:45.958
Okay. Good.

25:46.879 --> 25:47.869
Here.

25:49.298 --> 25:52.541
- That's a...
- Mental activity dampener.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.881
Sorry version 2.0.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.758
You have to adhere it
to your supraorbital ridge.

25:57.848 --> 25:58.838
It will block West out.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.389
Look, I'm sorry about...

26:02.436 --> 26:04.894
You know, I just recently
can't seem to stop DeVoe.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.687
Can't stop my daughter Jesse
from hating me.

26:06.774 --> 26:07.981
Can't seem to stop blowing it

26:08.067 --> 26:09.979
when I'm trying to befriend
someone who's my own age.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.438
Did you just say "befriend"?

26:11.528 --> 26:14.236
That's what you've been trying to do?
You've been trying to befriend me?

26:14.323 --> 26:16.189
Well, yes, through transitive property.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.404
I respect West, West respects you, so.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.987
Harry, that was borderline sweet.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.196
Thank you.

26:23.290 --> 26:26.283
- Okay, we'll talk.
- When?

26:27.461 --> 26:28.793
- Now.
- Okay.

26:28.879 --> 26:29.915
Okay.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.084
- I'm not much...
- Come on, Harry.

26:33.967 --> 26:35.048
Okay.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.006
What do you wanna talk about?

26:38.222 --> 26:40.384
Oh, okay. I'll start. Um...

26:40.599 --> 26:41.680
You wanna tell me how this thing works?

26:41.767 --> 26:44.976
Does it keep Joe's brainwaves
blocked out?

26:45.062 --> 26:47.179
Does it keep my mind
reading waves locked in?

26:47.272 --> 26:49.559
Mostly disrupts
the inbound brain activity,

26:49.650 --> 26:52.188
but I suppose actually,

26:53.028 --> 26:55.270
if you were to reverse the polarity.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.948
Wow. That is interesting.

26:59.993 --> 27:02.986
- Also...
- Yes. Harry, you have to do that.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.696
- Right.
- Right now.

27:05.415 --> 27:07.407
- Okay, good chat.
- Okay.

27:11.004 --> 27:13.963
Should be good to go.
Might leave a little scar though.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.169
Wouldn't be my first, doc.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.126
Probably won't be my last.

27:18.220 --> 27:19.882
It will be
if I had anything to do with it.

27:20.347 --> 27:22.009
Why would you have
anything to do with it?

27:23.308 --> 27:26.051
I am gonna go.

27:31.733 --> 27:32.769
What are you doing?

27:32.860 --> 27:34.852
The way I see it,
I've got more hurt here

27:34.945 --> 27:36.277
than I ever did fighting DeVoe.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.946
So I'm not going to spend
another second training.

27:39.032 --> 27:42.150
Okay, that is a really bad idea.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.452
I've already hurt Devoe

27:44.872 --> 27:47.159
by myself without y'all.

27:47.583 --> 27:48.664
I can do it again.

27:48.750 --> 27:53.836
Izzy, the only way for you to
stay safe is for you to stay with us.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.381
It's the buddy system, right?

27:58.051 --> 27:59.633
You're not my buddy, Ralph.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.420
Hey, hey, hey.

28:05.309 --> 28:06.390
Don't do this.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.895
Sorry, Ralphy.

28:20.991 --> 28:24.405
Initially, I envisioned
the mental activity dampener

28:24.494 --> 28:27.407
as just disrupting
inbound brainwave broadcast,

28:27.497 --> 28:29.830
but I talked to DA Cecile Horton,
and we had the idea

28:29.917 --> 28:32.534
to invert the polarity,
allowing this to disrupt

28:32.920 --> 28:35.583
outbound brainwave
broadcast as well. So we...

28:35.672 --> 28:38.665
- We could use this against DeVoe.
- "We could use this against DeVoe."

28:39.134 --> 28:40.124
That's brilliant.

28:40.636 --> 28:44.380
I'm totally on board
except mental activity dampener.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.223
Ramon, the name's no good.
Which is why, drum roll please,

28:47.935 --> 28:52.054
I've decided to rename
this the cerebral inhibitor.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.062
<i>This is where we came up</i>

28:54.149 --> 28:57.017
with the cerebral inhibitor
to use against DeVoe.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.316
What's that? What are you guys doing?
What are those faces?

29:02.658 --> 29:04.240
When Savitar came to S.T.A.R. Labs,

29:04.326 --> 29:07.285
he said that we would build
a device to use against DeVoe.

29:07.371 --> 29:08.703
The cerebral inhibitor.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.496
I wish I had known that
before I spent all this time

29:10.582 --> 29:11.789
trying to come up with a second name.

29:11.875 --> 29:12.911
Naming is hard.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.742
Okay. So we can use this on DeVoe

29:14.836 --> 29:17.419
to keep him from projecting
his consciousness into new bodies?

29:17.506 --> 29:19.372
- Precisely.
- How does it work?

29:19.466 --> 29:22.049
Just fix it to his forehead,
it activates. Simple as that.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.047
I'll make a few adjustments,
you'll be good to go.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.127
All right.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.804
Okay, when Harry's done,
we go after DeVoe.

29:26.890 --> 29:29.803
I mean we have Izzy's powers,
the cerebral inhibitor.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.634
We have everything that
we need to stop him.

29:31.812 --> 29:34.475
Except that we don't. Izzy's gone.

29:34.898 --> 29:35.888
What? What happened?

29:35.983 --> 29:36.973
What did you say to her?

29:37.067 --> 29:38.308
- Me?
- Yeah.

29:38.402 --> 29:40.735
Rookie, homeslice
hit the road because of you.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.146
She's convinced she can
take on DeVoe by herself.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.572
That's what she's gone to do.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.951
You kept pushing and pushing.
You pushed her right out that door, man.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.072
Okay, that's not fair.

29:49.162 --> 29:51.449
No, it's all right. I did.
I pushed her too hard.

29:51.957 --> 29:54.870
It's my fault she's out there, but
if DeVoe gets to her before we do...

29:54.960 --> 29:56.576
That cannot happen.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.835
Cisco, you gotta use your E.S.P.N.
and find out where she is.

30:00.924 --> 30:01.914
Give me that.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.097
Hey, blondie.

30:10.726 --> 30:13.264
You want trouble? Here I am.

30:17.274 --> 30:18.435
Well.

30:19.901 --> 30:23.269
Look who finally decided
to show her sorry face.

30:26.491 --> 30:29.450
Nobody likes a Peeping Tom.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.495
Goodbye, Mr. Ramon.

30:39.296 --> 30:40.787
Cisco, are you okay? Can you hear me?

30:40.881 --> 30:42.622
She's at the warehouse district.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.165
DeVoe is there.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.542
I can't go with you guys.
I gotta take care of Cisco.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.252
Okay, Ralph, it's just me and you.
Come on.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.016
Bravo, Miss Bowin.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.313
Of all my subjects, you're the only one

30:59.399 --> 31:01.812
to mount a credible defense against me.

31:01.902 --> 31:05.361
Darlin', you talk too much.

31:11.912 --> 31:15.826
A modicum of bad luck
at a time like this.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.782
How unfortunate.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.618
You're quite the fiddler.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.123
The Fiddler.

31:21.213 --> 31:24.706
Mr. Ramon might say, "Nailed it in one."

31:28.887 --> 31:29.968
Ralph?

31:31.098 --> 31:32.509
You came after me.

31:32.599 --> 31:33.680
We all did.

31:34.601 --> 31:38.220
All right, Ralph, I'll keep DeVoe busy.
You just get the inhibitor on.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.562
Hello, Mr. Allen.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.766
DeVoe, you're not getting her.

31:56.373 --> 31:57.363
Flash!

32:00.961 --> 32:02.168
Poor Dominic.

32:02.754 --> 32:06.247
He didn't know he could
affect minds as well as read them.

32:06.341 --> 32:10.426
Now I have taught you
what a brain aneurysm feels like.

32:12.681 --> 32:13.671
Get out of here.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.312
Aw, crap!

32:34.453 --> 32:36.820
Thank you, Mr. Rundine.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.121
That will teach you
to mess with a country girl.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.662
Cerebral inhibitor is attached.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.914
- Is it working?
- It's working.

32:49.176 --> 32:53.090
How did Mr. Deacon put it?

32:54.055 --> 32:55.671
Ah, yes.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.346
Call me Kilg%re.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.272
What the hell?

33:05.484 --> 33:06.600
Did she hack the inhibitor?

33:06.693 --> 33:07.683
No, that's impossible.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.861
There's a kill-switch microchip that
prevents the patch from networking.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.573
I can hear your radio signal, Mr. Wells.

33:15.702 --> 33:19.491
You told me once
I wasn't as smart as I thought.

33:19.873 --> 33:22.115
<i>Wrong again.</i>

33:27.923 --> 33:28.913
Izzy!

33:38.391 --> 33:40.724
- Ralph?
- Hey.

33:41.770 --> 33:42.760
Get her out of there!

33:42.854 --> 33:44.061
<i>Ralph, we can't.</i>

33:45.190 --> 33:46.180
Get her out!

33:48.902 --> 33:49.892
We can't.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.118
Izzy, just look at me.

34:14.969 --> 34:17.303
Izzy, keep looking at me.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.202
Much better.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.083
Please inform Mr. Ramon

34:51.172 --> 34:53.585
that while I had no need for all

34:53.675 --> 34:55.132
<i>six of my powers,</i>

34:55.467 --> 34:57.004
<i>I now have a seventh.</i>

34:57.345 --> 35:01.840
I'm afraid I'm gonna be busy
with my wife this weekend, Ralphy.

35:01.933 --> 35:02.923
No.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.307
- How's Ralph?
- Not great.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.727
This shouldn't have happened.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.138
DeVoe wasn't supposed
to walk away from this.

35:51.232 --> 35:53.315
Yeah, well, he did. Because of me.

35:53.401 --> 35:54.937
We all tried to protect her.

35:55.028 --> 35:56.314
I built the inhibitor, Snow.

35:56.613 --> 35:58.525
If it failed, it's my fault.
I don't even know why.

35:58.615 --> 36:00.982
Maybe I overestimated
the microcombustion infrastructure.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.568
Maybe I underestimated
the amount of time

36:03.662 --> 36:04.903
between each synapse router.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.487
Or maybe it didn't malfunction at all.

36:06.915 --> 36:10.829
Guys, Savitar said that we would use
the cerebral inhibitor against DeVoe.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.205
Yeah. He didn't say it was gonna work.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.002
Or it didn't work because...

36:16.508 --> 36:17.919
I'm not smart enough to make it work.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.585
- Harry, where are you going?
- Out.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.005
- Guys, we have to find DeVoe again.
- How?

36:24.099 --> 36:26.637
Cisco tracked down DeVoe in his Vibe
state and almost got himself killed.

36:26.726 --> 36:27.807
Actually,

36:28.687 --> 36:30.679
we might have a different
way of pinpointing him.

36:32.482 --> 36:33.472
Check this out.

36:34.401 --> 36:35.482
Space.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.351
The final frontier.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.194
Now you see it.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.147
Now you don't.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.734
That's exactly what it looks like
when DeVoe disappears.

36:44.994 --> 36:47.202
That is the warping signature

36:47.288 --> 36:51.123
of someone moving into
a pocket dimension.

36:51.418 --> 36:53.410
Does someone wanna explain
what that means?

36:53.503 --> 36:54.539
Einstein postulated

36:54.629 --> 36:57.622
that it was theoretically possible
for a region specific fold

36:57.716 --> 37:00.129
in the space-time to exist between

37:00.218 --> 37:02.005
the four dimensions
that we typically think of.

37:02.512 --> 37:03.548
Yeah, that doesn't help.

37:03.638 --> 37:06.381
It's another dimension.

37:06.599 --> 37:10.843
One that you can enter or exit
at any location in the world.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.724
Like how DeVoe captured me
in that alley,

37:12.814 --> 37:15.056
but then he brought me back out
just somewhere above the city.

37:15.692 --> 37:18.309
Are you saying that DeVoe's lair
is in a pocket dimension?

37:18.403 --> 37:20.144
- Cisco, that is great.
- Can we track him?

37:20.530 --> 37:22.396
That I'm still working on.

37:22.490 --> 37:23.480
Okay. Work faster.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.611
Just do your best, all right?
Let's find him.

37:28.997 --> 37:29.987
All right.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.118
- I'm gonna go check on Ralph.
- All right.

37:35.462 --> 37:36.543
You were right.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.498
As much as I want to get DeVoe,
and get back to our lives,

37:41.468 --> 37:42.458
I can't rush this.

37:43.553 --> 37:45.169
It's gonna be
a little hard for a speedster.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.380
Especially an unemployed speedster.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.556
Don't worry.
You're gonna find something.

37:50.018 --> 37:51.099
And until then?

37:52.228 --> 37:54.060
You can start by kissing your wife.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.811
- Someone looks busy.
- Yeah.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.990
I have a little bit of work.
Why don't you have it, okay?

38:07.577 --> 38:08.658
- Harry.
- Yes.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.077
- I wanted to say thank you.
- For what?

38:10.163 --> 38:12.871
The M.A.D. 2.0, it worked like a charm.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.994
I am rested.
If you could just do something

38:15.084 --> 38:16.541
about these swollen
pregnant ankles of mine.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.789
Edema is a normal thing.

38:17.879 --> 38:19.836
You drink lots of water.
Don't cross your legs when you sit.

38:19.923 --> 38:22.131
Okay. Thank you for the info.

38:22.217 --> 38:23.628
It's the least
I could do after all the...

38:24.177 --> 38:26.009
Mmm.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.882
Rage. I have a problem with rage.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.430
Apparently, it tends to crop up
when I make mistakes.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.633
Makes it tough to be human.

38:33.895 --> 38:36.387
The humans are a tricky species.
Anyway, I apologize.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.017
Apology accepted.

38:38.483 --> 38:41.772
- You just needed somebody to talk to.
- Yeah.

38:41.903 --> 38:42.893
Yeah, I guess you're...

38:44.030 --> 38:45.441
Are you doing that thing
where you're reading my mind?

38:45.532 --> 38:46.522
You're reading my mind, aren't you?

38:47.659 --> 38:49.366
Maybe. Yeah.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.318
Yeah, I am. You should call her Harry.

38:51.412 --> 38:53.404
Jesse's on a different planet,
DA Cecile Horton.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.034
But this problem
isn't gonna just go away.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.114
What if she...

38:57.710 --> 38:58.917
What if she doesn't come?

39:00.713 --> 39:02.295
You're not gonna know
unless you invite her.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.769
That was beautiful.

39:22.110 --> 39:25.274
And a welcome change
from the derivative pablum

39:25.363 --> 39:27.400
this body subjected us to before.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.444
Our plan is back on schedule.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.527
Indeed, it is.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.201
Only a few more subjects left to locate.

40:01.149 --> 40:02.139
Hey, man.

40:03.318 --> 40:06.231
- I can come back.
- No, it's okay.

40:09.616 --> 40:12.108
Look, um, I totally understand

40:12.201 --> 40:14.033
if you need some time
away from the team.

40:15.163 --> 40:19.999
I mean, to lose someone
right in front of you.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.293
Especially
someone you care about.

40:24.631 --> 40:27.374
Izzy was very special.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.249
Yes, she was.

40:30.887 --> 40:32.753
But, now,

40:34.432 --> 40:36.094
DeVoe is still out there.

40:37.727 --> 40:39.218
And until that threat's over,

40:40.647 --> 40:42.604
you gotta keep this buddy system going.

40:43.983 --> 40:46.600
I thought
you might say that, Allen,

40:47.278 --> 40:49.736
which is why I got you this.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.443
You want me to be your partner?

40:55.828 --> 40:59.697
Oh, hey, come on.
This Turner don't need no Hooch.

40:59.791 --> 41:03.831
But I do know what it's like
to get fired from C.C.P.D.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.832
when you didn't even
really break the law.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.712
You absolutely broke the law.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.667
And I remember after I lost my job,

41:12.220 --> 41:13.836
I felt like I lost
a piece of my identity.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.047
And now, you won't have
to deal with that problem.

41:18.059 --> 41:19.175
So the next time we're out in the field

41:19.268 --> 41:20.804
and somebody asks you who you work for,

41:20.895 --> 41:23.012
you won't have to get all stammery.

41:24.107 --> 41:25.097
You like me.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.728
You really like me.

41:30.238 --> 41:32.821
Don't go getting
all soft on me now, rookie.

41:34.659 --> 41:37.322
You and I, we gotta stand up
and we gotta fight back.

41:37.870 --> 41:40.112
- Just like Izzy would want it.
- That's right.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.741
There's three more people
out there who need our help.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.418
And we need to find them
before DeVoe does.

41:47.296 --> 41:48.412
And after we do that,

41:49.799 --> 41:51.290
I'm gonna take DeVoe down.
