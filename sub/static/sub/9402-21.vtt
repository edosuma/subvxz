00:03.987 --> 00:06.906
I got an offer to shoot a job

00:13.220 --> 00:14.637
The Rivercourt.
Yeah.

00:14.688 --> 00:16.672
Two words --

00:16.724 --> 00:18.858
Snipey Plover.

00:18.942 --> 00:20.360
It's a bird.

00:20.444 --> 00:22.945
All my life,
I've wanted to fly.

00:23.013 --> 00:24.847

I've been feeling...

00:24.898 --> 00:26.349
A sense of obligation.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.868
I needed to take that drug test
to join the Air Force.

00:28.952 --> 00:32.037
And I took
a pregnancy test.

00:33.523 --> 00:35.208
We're pregnant.

00:35.292 --> 00:37.526

Snipey Plover.

01:21.789 --> 01:24.240
It eats insects
and worms and stuff,

01:24.291 --> 01:25.792
it has orangey legs,

01:25.876 --> 01:28.711

areas, near water.

01:28.762 --> 01:30.263

01:30.347 --> 01:31.580
Yeah.

01:31.632 --> 01:33.466
So, you sure
they're endangered?

01:33.550 --> 01:34.600
Uh-huh.

01:34.685 --> 01:36.252
Miss Lauren
took us on a field trip,

01:36.303 --> 01:38.020
and I remember
she said it was endangered

01:38.088 --> 01:39.856
right before Chuck threw up
a bunch of chocolate milk

01:39.923 --> 01:41.107
he chugged on a dare.

01:41.191 --> 01:42.258
Why?

01:42.309 --> 01:44.110
Because Chuck is an idiot.

01:44.194 --> 01:46.145
No -- why does it matter
if it's endangered?

01:46.230 --> 01:48.698
Because if we can find
your Snipey Plover,

01:48.765 --> 01:50.450
we can save the Rivercourt.

you could

03:53.144 --> 03:55.196

that Quinn's gone,

03:55.280 --> 03:56.664
and I kind of made plans.

03:56.748 --> 03:58.082
Like what plans?

03:58.149 --> 04:01.669

up from the garage,

04:01.737 --> 04:03.754
put on my favorite shirt
that you just made fun of.

04:03.822 --> 04:05.573
I have some magazines to read,
my laptop,

04:05.640 --> 04:06.841

04:11.346 --> 04:13.597
I <i>love</i> a drink from a cooler,

08:34.609 --> 08:36.260
and they're going with

08:52.711 --> 08:55.129

that we used on our shoots

09:53.502 --> 09:55.453
were kind of strange-looking
in...person.

09:55.537 --> 09:59.007
Yeah. She's a dog.

09:59.074 --> 10:00.208
Wow.

10:00.259 --> 10:01.542
Quinn?
Hi.

Taryn.
Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

10:02.811 --> 10:03.945
I'm such a big fan.
Ohh.

10:04.013 --> 10:05.630

Brooke and Alex.

10:44.470 --> 10:45.953
So, why do you need

10:46.005 --> 10:48.673
Because they're doing
a new morning show,

10:48.757 --> 10:51.559
and tomorrow my live segment
is my audition.

10:51.626 --> 10:52.677
That's amazing.

10:52.761 --> 10:54.178
Yeah...

10:54.263 --> 10:56.264
But they said they've
seen me be funny and angry.

10:56.331 --> 10:58.516
They want
to see me be serious.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.735

11:20.973 --> 11:22.707
We use Julian's camera
and roll it continuously.

11:22.791 --> 11:24.658
Then we'll take turns
switching out the memory cards.

11:24.710 --> 11:27.661
Hopefully, that'll get us some
footage of the snarling rover.

11:27.713 --> 11:29.630
Snipey Plover.

11:29.681 --> 11:31.015
Plus,
it's a full moon tonight,

11:31.083 --> 11:32.300
so we should have
plenty of light.

11:32.351 --> 11:34.685
That's it?
We're just gonna film it?

11:34.770 --> 11:37.055

we were gonna catch it.

11:37.139 --> 11:38.606

Chuck, the Snipey Plover's
an endangered species.

11:41.977 --> 11:43.344
So?

11:43.395 --> 11:45.780

you shoot it with a slingshot.

22:20.066 --> 22:21.783
Thought I would
check the footage

22:21.850 --> 22:23.652
and look for our friend,
the Plover.

22:24.853 --> 22:25.954
Any luck?

22:26.021 --> 22:27.038
Nope.

22:27.123 --> 22:28.957
Maybe in the morning.

22:31.310 --> 22:33.295
It's nice of you
to do this --

22:33.362 --> 22:35.664
spend a weekend
trying to help Jamie.

22:35.715 --> 22:37.716
I'm sure
he appreciates it.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.718
Yeah.

22:39.802 --> 22:42.870
You know, sometimes I think
about when we were kids

22:42.922 --> 22:46.174
and the memories I have
of my parents and their friends.

22:46.225 --> 22:47.509
And then I think,

22:47.560 --> 22:50.145
"this is what they'll remember
when they look back."

22:50.212 --> 22:53.064
You know, these are the days
that they'll stories about.

22:53.149 --> 22:56.484
That's when I feel like
I can do better,

22:56.552 --> 22:59.554
that I have the responsibility
to try.

23:02.241 --> 23:05.276
You know, Jamie's gonna miss you
when you leave to New York.

23:05.361 --> 23:07.362
He'll miss you <i>and</i> Brooke.
We all will.

23:07.413 --> 23:09.364
Uh...

23:09.415 --> 23:11.065
We're not leaving.

23:12.234 --> 23:13.735
Brooke passed on the job.

23:13.786 --> 23:14.919
How come?

23:15.004 --> 23:17.872
Because she's pregnant.

23:17.923 --> 23:19.841
But I-I thought...

23:19.908 --> 23:21.343
That she couldn't
get pregnant?

23:21.410 --> 23:23.077
So did we.

23:23.129 --> 23:25.096
But she is.
We just found out.

23:25.181 --> 23:28.466
I'm not supposed to
tell anybody yet, so...

23:28.551 --> 23:29.751
You fertile bastard.

23:31.354 --> 23:32.387
Wow.

23:35.307 --> 23:36.891
I hope it's a girl

23:36.942 --> 23:39.444
and that
she's just like her mom

23:39.528 --> 23:41.446
and that someday, she'll be
best friends with Lydia Scott.

23:41.530 --> 23:44.115
I'll drink to that.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.600
Cheers.
Cheers.

23:59.480 --> 24:00.881
Quinn!

24:00.886 --> 24:02.420
Hey!

24:02.504 --> 24:04.305
You're up early.
Yeah, you, too.

24:04.373 --> 24:05.974
Where you off to?

24:06.041 --> 24:07.892
Thought I'd drive around
the city and shoot a little,

24:07.977 --> 24:09.477
sort of stray from
the beaten path, you know?

24:09.545 --> 24:10.645
Oh, I love that.

24:10.712 --> 24:12.564
Well, maybe
I'll see you later.

24:12.648 --> 24:14.882
I hope so.

24:16.986 --> 24:19.821
Hey, you want to come?

24:23.742 --> 24:25.460
So, how you doing,
Evans?

24:25.527 --> 24:28.830
800 -- that's the thread count
of my sheets at home.

24:28.897 --> 24:31.565
The tent did <i>not</i>
<i>get it done last night.</i>

24:31.617 --> 24:34.352
You <i>know</i> the thread count
of your sheets.

24:34.420 --> 24:37.789
Triple salchow right now.

24:41.894 --> 24:43.911
When the Rivercourt's gone,

24:43.963 --> 24:45.546
a lot of memories
are gonna go with it.

24:45.598 --> 24:48.182
I used to
train with Q there,

24:48.250 --> 24:52.553
Jimmy Edwards,
my Uncle Keith.

24:52.605 --> 24:54.889
It's worth a weekend
to try to save that.

24:54.940 --> 24:56.524
Yeah, I know.

24:56.591 --> 24:58.359
The truth is,
I wouldn't have missed it.

24:58.427 --> 25:01.562
I know.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.615
I am thinking about going
on a coffee run, though.

25:03.699 --> 25:04.949
Thank God.

25:05.034 --> 25:06.767
I don't understand camping.

25:06.819 --> 25:08.820
We have houses.

25:08.904 --> 25:12.874
We have beds, showers,
flatirons.

25:16.795 --> 25:20.715
So, you must be excited
about Brooke's...

25:20.782 --> 25:22.583
Thing I'm not supposed to
know about.

25:22.635 --> 25:24.002
We're totally excited,

25:24.086 --> 25:26.504
and we appreciate
you not saying anything,

25:26.588 --> 25:28.622
even though I might've slipped
up and told Nathan last night.

25:28.674 --> 25:30.758
Mm. I don't know
anything about that.

25:32.061 --> 25:34.646
So, why'd you have to take
a drug test, anyway?

25:34.730 --> 25:35.813
Well

25:35.898 --> 25:38.466
Since I'm carrying around
your secret,

25:38.517 --> 25:40.968
I guess you could
carry around mine.

25:41.020 --> 25:42.470
I joined the Air Force.

25:42.521 --> 25:44.989
Wow. That's big.

25:45.024 --> 25:47.492
Yeah.
And I got to leave soon.

25:52.581 --> 25:55.083
Hey, Chuck, buddy.

25:55.150 --> 25:56.650
I want to go home.

26:09.214 --> 26:11.665
Sometimes it strikes me

26:11.717 --> 26:14.835
how poverty and privilege
become silent neighbors

26:14.887 --> 26:17.772
and the world
just keeps going

26:17.839 --> 26:19.190
'cause it has to.

26:30.152 --> 26:33.871
"I'm standing here today
on a small piece of history."

26:36.625 --> 26:40.795
"A small piece
of Tree Hill history."

26:40.862 --> 26:44.716
Chuck, just open the door
and let me explain.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.884
You didn't even tell me!

26:46.969 --> 26:48.386
I was going to.

26:48.470 --> 26:49.703
I promise!

26:49.755 --> 26:51.756
Just open the door.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.758
You have the keys.

26:53.842 --> 26:56.260
It's an old car, Chuck.

26:56.345 --> 26:59.147
I have the ignition key.
I don't have the door key.

26:59.214 --> 27:02.183
So, come on.
Open up.

27:02.234 --> 27:04.718
Just forget it!

27:04.770 --> 27:07.655
I want to go home!

27:07.722 --> 27:09.490
Well,
you won't open the door,

27:09.558 --> 27:13.077
so...I guess
you're stuck in here.

27:34.016 --> 27:36.250
Oh!

27:40.639 --> 27:43.024
How'd you like
to do a little work?

27:49.114 --> 27:50.982
Aah!

28:44.119 --> 28:46.787
I tried talking to him,
but he's really upset.

28:46.839 --> 28:48.256
He won't do anything crazy,
will he?

28:50.042 --> 28:51.759
We're talking
about Chuck here.

28:53.212 --> 28:54.846

I sat on the porch and waited
till it got dark out.

33:29.948 --> 33:31.749
And then my mom
came and got me.

33:31.800 --> 33:35.887
For the longest time, I was sure
something happened to him.

33:35.954 --> 33:39.507
I didn't know how to feel
when I found out he was okay.

33:41.777 --> 33:44.395
He just
didn't want us anymore.

33:46.181 --> 33:49.267
That's not gonna happen
with me, okay?

33:50.969 --> 33:52.670
I'll be back in no time.

33:52.738 --> 33:54.405
You promise?

33:54.472 --> 33:56.023
Promise.

33:58.243 --> 34:01.579
I never did learn
to ride a stupid bike.

34:03.498 --> 34:04.749
Don't tell anyone?

34:17.246 --> 34:18.596
I can't --

34:18.663 --> 34:21.599
Oh.

34:21.666 --> 34:23.667
Well, Antwon says he didn't
get any pictures from you,

34:23.719 --> 34:25.502
but that he'd like some.

34:25.554 --> 34:26.938
Okay, maybe you sent them
to someone

34:27.005 --> 34:28.438
who's next to Antwon
in your address book.

34:28.505 --> 34:30.107
Let me check mine.

34:30.175 --> 34:32.226
Honestly, if it's not him, I don't
know who I would have texted.

34:32.311 --> 34:33.728
I don't know.

34:33.812 --> 34:35.780
That would be Antonio Banderas.
What?

34:35.847 --> 34:38.149
You sent Antonio Banderas
naked pictures.

34:38.199 --> 34:41.152
Semi-naked photos, and he's in
my phonebook under "skills."

34:41.203 --> 34:43.536
But could I please have
Antonio Banderas' phone number?

34:43.621 --> 34:45.356
Yeah, me, too.
I'll take that.

34:45.407 --> 34:46.290
Ehh!
Oh, no!

34:46.358 --> 34:47.824
Oh!

34:47.876 --> 34:49.909
Who is next to skills
in my phone?

34:59.388 --> 35:01.973
Well
We gave it a shot, jame.

35:02.040 --> 35:05.676
We ruined some protected
wetlands, but we gave it a shot.

35:05.727 --> 35:08.229
Dad, look!

35:09.514 --> 35:10.648
Hmm.

35:10.715 --> 35:12.149

in Tree Hill.

35:52.524 --> 35:54.725
No costumes, no catchphrases --

35:54.793 --> 35:57.278
just a story
about a local landmark

35:57.362 --> 35:59.030
that is soon to be erased,

35:59.097 --> 36:02.316
developed into condominiums
unless something changes.

36:02.401 --> 36:05.986
The landmark
is called the Rivercourt,

36:06.071 --> 36:09.590
and for those who loved it, its
absence will be heartbreaking.

and fashion designers.

36:46.244 --> 36:48.612
Notable musicians
have played here --

36:48.663 --> 36:50.581
both concerts
and games of "horse."

36:50.648 --> 36:52.483
And on gentle summer nights

36:52.534 --> 36:56.036
as the staccato rhythms of
worn leather on fading asphalt

36:56.121 --> 36:57.654
mixes with the white noise

36:57.706 --> 37:00.324
of the distant nightlife
across the Cape Fear,

37:00.375 --> 37:01.725
kids have grown up here.

37:03.795 --> 37:05.880
I should know.
I was one of them.

37:05.997 --> 37:09.049
Now development threatens
to erase this place.

37:09.134 --> 37:10.684
Commerce is commerce.

37:10.769 --> 37:13.104
That's not really the point,
is it?

37:13.171 --> 37:14.505
The truth is,

37:14.556 --> 37:17.725
a town's identity is made up
of places like this one.

37:17.809 --> 37:19.977
And once they're gone,
they're gone.

37:20.045 --> 37:22.346
Some people
who care about this court

37:22.397 --> 37:24.181
have uncovered a nest nearby

37:24.249 --> 37:26.167
that could be the key
to stopping the bulldozers

37:26.201 --> 37:27.535
you see behind me.

37:27.602 --> 37:30.738
But even so, do we have to find
a technicality

37:30.822 --> 37:32.856
to preserve our town's history?

37:38.797 --> 37:40.131
A lot of lost kids

37:40.198 --> 37:43.200
found their way to something
better in this park.

37:43.251 --> 37:46.921
In a confusing world, at
a confusing time in their lives,

37:47.005 --> 37:49.807
they found something
that made sense here,

37:49.874 --> 37:52.709
and they became better people
because of it.

37:52.761 --> 37:55.429
Surely <i>that</i> is worth preserving.
