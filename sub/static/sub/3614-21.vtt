WEBVTT

00:05.449 --> 00:07.724
Any day that brings new shoes
is a good day.

00:07.889 --> 00:09.686
Are you kidding?
This was a great day.

00:09.889 --> 00:12.926
Yoga, pedicure, shopping, lunch.
When have we had more fun?

00:13.089 --> 00:16.718
It's nice to bond through something
other than vanquishing for a change.

00:16.889 --> 00:19.357
Yeah, but I gotta hand it
to those pesky little demons.

00:19.529 --> 00:21.440
They sure have brought us
closer together.

00:22.529 --> 00:25.248
Maybe you should write them
thank-you notes.

00:25.409 --> 00:27.081
- Crowds early this morning
when an argument

00:27.249 --> 00:29.683
between neighbours at a block party
turned into a street brawl.

00:29.849 --> 00:32.841
Residents of several apartment
buildings poured into the street...

00:34.409 --> 00:36.445
Some people are just crazy.

00:36.609 --> 00:40.079
Doesn't it seem like this kind of stuff
has been happening a lot lately?

00:40.249 --> 00:44.162
Random social violence is encouraged
by a general decline in ethical thinking.

00:44.409 --> 00:46.764
Well, according to
my sociology professor.

00:46.929 --> 00:49.318
He said that we don't think
about the big questions enough.

00:49.769 --> 00:52.442
The big question is how did you
stay awake through his class?

00:52.969 --> 00:56.041
Not only did I stay awake,
but I actually enjoyed it.

00:56.209 --> 00:57.642
Which is why I bought this book.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.522
It's filled with really deep,
profound questions.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.566
It would actually make
a good bar game at P3.

01:05.769 --> 01:08.806
Oh, great, solve the problems
of the world while doing Jell-O shots.

01:09.489 --> 01:12.401
Okay, let's see if I can find
a really good one.

01:12.609 --> 01:16.488
Okay, what if a building is on fire.

01:16.649 --> 01:19.402
Do you save five strangers
or one sibling?

01:19.809 --> 01:22.607
I thought that you said these were
hard questions. That's easy, sibling.

01:22.769 --> 01:24.521
- Of course.
- Ditto.

01:24.689 --> 01:27.522
- Okay, my turn, my turn.
- Okay.

01:28.209 --> 01:30.518
Okay, don't answer anything
till I answer that.

01:30.689 --> 01:33.203
Okay, faster though, faster.

01:39.409 --> 01:41.684
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:42.649 --> 01:44.640
Since when do you ring
instead of orb?

01:44.809 --> 01:46.765
Well, I'm just trying to respect
everybody's space,

01:46.929 --> 01:48.760
since the three of you
have been so...

01:49.289 --> 01:51.803
- Hey, Leo.
...tight these days.

01:52.009 --> 01:54.125
So are you here for all of us?

01:54.529 --> 01:56.679
No, this isn't business.
I was just about

01:56.889 --> 02:00.484
to invite Piper to an early dinner
before the Paula Cole show.

02:02.169 --> 02:03.841
Do you have other plans?

02:04.169 --> 02:07.127
Not exactly, we...
We've just been hanging out all day,

02:07.289 --> 02:10.086
spending some quality,
non-magic time and...

02:10.689 --> 02:12.441
All right, well, no problem.

02:12.609 --> 02:14.122
Rain check?

02:14.329 --> 02:17.605
Piper, why don't you go with Leo?
I mean, we're totally cool with it.

02:17.809 --> 02:20.960
Pheebs and I will go to the club early,
keep an eye on things.

02:21.129 --> 02:22.881
Oh, yeah, I have
a new assistant manager,

02:23.049 --> 02:25.722
and she's all checked out,
so she can take care of things.

02:25.889 --> 02:27.880
Still, we'll go and make sure
everything's okay.

02:28.489 --> 02:30.366
We'll bring the book,
maybe stir up some trouble.

02:30.529 --> 02:32.804
- How about stirring up margaritas?
- That's good too.

02:33.009 --> 02:34.647
- What are we gonna wear?
- I don't know.

02:34.809 --> 02:37.528
- So it's a date?
- All right.

02:43.769 --> 02:45.680
I didn't mean that I didn't enjoy
being with you.

02:45.849 --> 02:50.400
All I meant was that Phoebe and Prue
would've enjoyed the restaurant too.

02:53.809 --> 02:55.481
Come on.

02:57.049 --> 03:00.121
Wish you were normal sisters.
They're never this close.

03:00.329 --> 03:01.887
And it's a problem that we are?

03:02.089 --> 03:03.647
No.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.039
It just seems that sometimes
I'm breaking up a great party

03:06.209 --> 03:07.801
when I wanna be alone with you.

03:10.009 --> 03:13.558
Leo, I have room for all of you
in my life and in my heart.

03:16.369 --> 03:20.123
I still need to know
which room's mine because...

03:21.929 --> 03:24.045
Why don't you learn to drive!

03:25.129 --> 03:26.244
Okay.

03:31.049 --> 03:32.164
Oh, no.

03:33.089 --> 03:34.681
- Why'd you take the corner like that?
- Come here.

03:34.849 --> 03:37.363
Hey, get out of there.
What are you doing?

03:42.129 --> 03:43.960
Get off of me.

03:46.649 --> 03:47.923
Hey, you...

03:51.409 --> 03:53.877
What on earth?

03:55.000 --> 04:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:05.889 --> 04:07.004
- Leo?
- I see him.

04:09.529 --> 04:11.963
Wait, Piper,
you don't know what he is.

06:55.209 --> 06:58.758
Thank you, P3, you've been great.
Thank you.

07:07.289 --> 07:10.998
Hey, I can't believe you guys missed
Paula Cole. She was awesome.

07:11.209 --> 07:13.279
We saw a pretty awesome
show ourselves.

07:13.489 --> 07:16.322
- I thought you guys went to dinner.
- We did, and then for dessert,

07:16.489 --> 07:18.719
- we did a little demon hunting.
- What happened?

07:18.929 --> 07:21.568
There was this road-rage thing,
it was completely out of control.

07:21.729 --> 07:24.243
So I froze the entire street
except for a guy in a suit.

07:24.409 --> 07:25.524
And he takes off.

07:25.889 --> 07:29.086
Your sister doesn't listen to me,
so we chase him down into an alley.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.921
Nothing, he vanished into thin air.

07:31.089 --> 07:33.319
Wait, a demon
that causes road rage?

07:33.529 --> 07:35.918
I don't know if he caused it
or was attracted by it.

07:36.129 --> 07:38.279
The kind of creature that
gets off on that would explain

07:38.449 --> 07:39.928
why the city's been
such a mess lately.

07:40.089 --> 07:43.081
He's probably, what,
some lower-level mischief-maker?

07:43.289 --> 07:45.598
Sooner you figure out who he is,
the better for everyone.

07:45.809 --> 07:47.845
Except for those of us
who have to get rid of him.

07:48.249 --> 07:50.558
Okay, well, we could sit around here
being pessimistic,

07:50.769 --> 07:53.761
or we could go to the house
and check the Book of Shadows.

08:01.129 --> 08:02.403
What happened?

08:02.569 --> 08:05.242
First of all, I wanna let you all know
that I was out in the field,

08:05.409 --> 08:08.606
and things are looking good.
The public is really responding.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.647
But?

08:11.209 --> 08:12.483
We might have a problem.

08:12.849 --> 08:15.602
- Did you screw up?
- Now, why would you assume that?

08:16.049 --> 08:17.277
Please don't fight.

08:17.769 --> 08:19.248
It's all they know how to do.

08:20.489 --> 08:23.322
A freezing witch saw me,
caught me working.

08:23.889 --> 08:25.004
A good witch?

08:25.169 --> 08:29.447
I would say so. She chased me.
I think she thought she could stop me.

08:30.409 --> 08:32.842
- That is a problem.
- Fixable.

08:33.049 --> 08:35.563
I think we can still
move forward with our plan

08:35.769 --> 08:37.087
and still make our deadline.

08:37.249 --> 08:39.683
But the deadline's 7:00
tomorrow night.

08:39.849 --> 08:42.078
- This horse is gonna...
- Find her and kill her.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.439
- How we gonna find her?
- Set a trap.

08:45.449 --> 08:48.009
If she's a good witch,
she'll want to stop us.

08:48.369 --> 08:51.042
All we have to do is give her
something she'll want to stop.

08:53.689 --> 08:56.123
- Wait, stop right there.
- The Demon of Cruelty?

08:56.569 --> 08:58.480
"Hardens the heart,
corrodes the soul..."

08:58.649 --> 09:00.719
And is a woman.

09:02.849 --> 09:05.317
Hey, so how is it going?

09:05.489 --> 09:07.320
In big, fat circles.

09:07.489 --> 09:08.763
We've been reading all night,

09:08.929 --> 09:11.159
and there's no one in here
who matches the guy I saw.

09:11.369 --> 09:13.405
We do have a list
of six potential matches, though.

09:13.569 --> 09:16.402
But there's no pictures,
so we're sort of shooting in the dark.

09:16.569 --> 09:18.446
My best guess
is the Demon of Anarchy.

09:18.609 --> 09:20.201
Hey, you can't just guess.

09:20.409 --> 09:21.762
All right? You have to be sure.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.362
It's very dangerous
to engage an enemy

09:23.529 --> 09:25.281
unless you know who he is
and what he wants.

09:25.689 --> 09:28.283
Leo, honey, we have
done this a couple times.

09:28.489 --> 09:30.081
- No, I didn't mean...
- You know, Leo,

09:30.249 --> 09:33.480
it would be great to know every single
thing about our enemies, but we can't.

09:33.689 --> 09:35.486
- I know, but...
- If this guy is causing riots,

09:35.649 --> 09:38.083
we can't just hang out
and wait for inspiration, you know?

09:38.489 --> 09:40.047
Okay. Three against one.

09:40.209 --> 09:43.360
All right? I just...
I was worried, that's all.

09:43.889 --> 09:45.766
Okay, so no offence
to the whitelighter,

09:45.929 --> 09:48.045
but we're going with
the Demon of Anarchy, right?

09:48.209 --> 09:49.722
Yes, the Demon of Anarchy.

09:50.369 --> 09:53.406
Okay, so this potion
doesn't even require a double boiler.

09:53.569 --> 09:56.242
And it's your basic
iambic pentameter chant.

09:56.409 --> 09:57.967
It's a very nice, simple vanquish.

09:58.169 --> 10:00.046
Okay, so all we have to do now

10:00.249 --> 10:02.046
is figure out where this guy's
gonna show up next.

10:02.209 --> 10:04.882
All right, who do we know that
would be keeping track of anarchy?

10:06.849 --> 10:10.000
Yeah, Prue, the department has
noticed an upswing in violence.

10:10.169 --> 10:13.605
The captain is calling them
"civil disturbances."

10:14.289 --> 10:17.122
In my professional opinion,
the whole city's lost its fricking mind.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.963
We got street brawls,
looting, arson.

10:20.129 --> 10:22.882
We're about two problems away
from being placed on tactical alert.

10:24.689 --> 10:26.281
You're not calling me
to tell me that

10:26.449 --> 10:28.405
this trouble is because of
you-know-what, are you?

10:29.649 --> 10:30.968
Yeah, well, possibly.

10:31.129 --> 10:33.768
We're actually researching that
right now.

10:33.929 --> 10:35.999
We were kind of
calling for your help.

10:36.809 --> 10:39.767
Look, I really can't leave right now.

10:39.969 --> 10:42.529
No, no, no, I understand,
and we're not quite there yet.

10:42.689 --> 10:45.487
But it would really help to know
where the latest hot spot is.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.040
Don't freeze him

11:04.249 --> 11:06.160
- and don't let him know we're here.
- All right.

11:06.329 --> 11:08.285
What the hell is wrong
with these people?

11:09.289 --> 11:13.407
I cannot wait to kick this guy's butt
all the way back to...

11:17.009 --> 11:20.206
All right, all right. This way, this way.

11:29.209 --> 11:31.928
- That's him, that's him.
- Well, let's go introduce ourselves.

11:32.089 --> 11:33.317
Prue.

11:48.089 --> 11:50.080
There are three of them.

11:52.009 --> 11:53.328
There's four of you?

11:56.849 --> 11:58.567
- Prue.
- Stop. Or I'll snap her neck.

11:59.689 --> 12:01.122
Start the chant.

12:02.889 --> 12:03.958
Start the damn chant.

12:07.409 --> 12:10.128
Sower of discord
Your works now must cease

12:10.289 --> 12:12.678
I vanquish thee now
With these words of peace

12:27.329 --> 12:30.287
- Prue?
- What the hell?

12:34.129 --> 12:35.960
What just happened?

12:36.649 --> 12:38.605
I think we just vanquished our sister.

12:45.609 --> 12:47.042
- She's gone.
- We don't know that.

12:47.209 --> 12:48.437
Phoebe, we killed Prue.

12:48.609 --> 12:50.520
Piper, stop it, okay?
I don't wanna hear that.

12:50.689 --> 12:53.761
You think I wanna say it? I'm the one
who made the potion. It's my fault.

12:53.929 --> 12:55.681
Okay, how about having a little faith?

12:55.849 --> 12:57.919
All right, our magic has never
let us down before.

12:58.089 --> 13:00.398
Well, there's a first time
for everything, isn't there?

13:00.569 --> 13:02.560
- She's not dead.
- How do you know that?

13:02.729 --> 13:06.244
Because, Piper,
I have no choice but to believe...

13:06.409 --> 13:07.808
...in us.

13:07.969 --> 13:09.800
And in our magic.

13:11.209 --> 13:12.562
Come here.

13:12.729 --> 13:16.768
Okay, look, if she were dead,
we would see her spirit, right?

13:16.929 --> 13:20.001
So maybe because
we brought the wrong spell,

13:20.169 --> 13:22.285
something weird happened.

13:22.449 --> 13:24.440
Maybe it just sent them someplace.

13:24.609 --> 13:27.203
- Where?
- I don't know.

13:27.489 --> 13:30.367
But I believe that we
can figure it out.

13:30.609 --> 13:33.203
And I need you to believe that too.

13:34.249 --> 13:37.844
We have Leo,
and we have the book.

13:38.089 --> 13:40.080
And we have each other.

13:41.569 --> 13:43.639
We can save Prue.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.925
There's gotta be a way.

13:53.089 --> 13:55.808
There's no way.
He's dead, and so are we.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.561
He's not dead. He can't be dead.

13:57.729 --> 14:00.243
He maybe shifted to another plane,
but he cannot be dead.

14:00.409 --> 14:02.843
Only the Source can kill us.
We are the Anointed Ones,

14:03.009 --> 14:04.442
the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

14:04.609 --> 14:07.169
The Source won't hesitate to kill us
if we miss our deadline.

14:07.329 --> 14:09.559
We're so close.
How did this happen?

14:09.729 --> 14:11.640
Somebody got sloppy
and attracted a witch.

14:11.849 --> 14:13.726
We will not fail.

14:13.929 --> 14:16.762
Other teams have failed.
They blew it, and they paid the price.

14:16.969 --> 14:19.358
We will too, if we miss our deadline.
And then he'll kill us

14:19.529 --> 14:22.760
and take four willing souls
from in there and anoint them.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.567
They'll be the next Four Horsemen.

14:24.729 --> 14:26.447
Glad to see you two aren't giving up.

14:26.609 --> 14:28.486
We need War, he's the big gun.

14:28.649 --> 14:30.685
He's the one who was gonna
set nation against nation

14:30.849 --> 14:32.202
and do all the heavy work.

14:32.369 --> 14:34.360
- Then we'll get him back.
- By 7:00?

14:34.569 --> 14:36.844
We have to.
Now, just listen to me, all right.

14:37.009 --> 14:39.443
Who got vanquished
and left you boss?

14:39.609 --> 14:41.327
I have a plan. Do you have a plan?

14:41.529 --> 14:44.726
Of course you have a plan. The same
plan you always have: Kill them all.

14:44.929 --> 14:47.602
- You looking for a fight?
- It's my specialty.

14:47.809 --> 14:50.004
We don't have much time.
Hear him out.

14:50.569 --> 14:53.037
All we have to do is find where he is.

14:53.249 --> 14:55.717
Let's pull out the old books,
do some research.

14:55.929 --> 14:59.319
All right? He has to be somewhere.
We will bring him back.

14:59.489 --> 15:01.480
There's gotta be a way.

15:02.289 --> 15:06.168
Peace talks have broken down
for the fourth, and possibly final time.

15:06.329 --> 15:08.081
Mortar fire could be heard
throughout the...

15:08.329 --> 15:09.887
Police clashed with rioters...

15:25.929 --> 15:29.046
Maybe if we break down
the spell and the potion.

15:29.209 --> 15:30.688
I am so sorry.

15:30.849 --> 15:33.079
- Did you find anything?
- I've been looking.

15:33.289 --> 15:35.245
And? Tell us you found something.

15:35.409 --> 15:38.207
I've been through the whole book,
and I can't find anything that matches

15:38.369 --> 15:39.597
the four beings you described.

15:39.769 --> 15:41.646
- What about disappearances?
- Nothing.

15:41.889 --> 15:43.959
Okay, we have to look
under "botched vanquishes."

15:44.129 --> 15:45.403
I've been through the whole book,

15:45.569 --> 15:47.560
there is no explanation
for what happened to Prue.

15:47.729 --> 15:48.957
But you agree she's not dead?

15:51.329 --> 15:52.557
I don't understand.

15:52.729 --> 15:55.926
Wait, wait, l... Wait a minute, l...
I can't do this.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.649
Phoebe tells me to have hope,
and you tell me there isn't any?

15:58.809 --> 16:00.401
I just need to know.

16:10.209 --> 16:11.483
Are you okay?

16:13.089 --> 16:14.317
She's here.

16:15.529 --> 16:16.757
Who's here?

16:17.249 --> 16:19.126
Prue. She went right through me.

16:19.329 --> 16:22.048
I felt her presence.
It's hard to describe, but...

16:22.209 --> 16:23.767
Didn't you see her? In the wind?

16:24.129 --> 16:25.357
She's in the wind?

16:25.609 --> 16:30.205
No, Phoebe, it's like
she spoke to me. She's alive.

16:31.049 --> 16:34.325
Are you sure? Because if she's in the
wind, doesn't that mean she's a spirit?

16:34.529 --> 16:36.326
- No.
- No.

16:36.489 --> 16:39.526
She could be on another plane,
trying to break through.

16:39.849 --> 16:42.363
Okay, well, then we have to help her.

16:43.689 --> 16:45.168
Prue?

16:45.329 --> 16:47.968
Prue, honey, are you still here?

16:48.529 --> 16:51.168
Help us find you, Prue.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.242
H...

16:58.369 --> 16:59.848
...E...

17:03.169 --> 17:05.046
...L...

17:07.689 --> 17:08.963
...P.

17:09.848 --> 17:12.409
Honey, how can we help you?

17:15.608 --> 17:17.679
What was that?
Did she do it to you too?

17:18.209 --> 17:20.598
No, it was something else.

17:20.809 --> 17:23.482
Or someone else.

17:23.648 --> 17:25.127
Evil.

17:25.289 --> 17:27.086
Cold.

17:33.049 --> 17:34.926
What is that?

17:35.089 --> 17:36.761
Prue?

17:59.729 --> 18:01.720
She's alive, but she's in trouble.

18:01.929 --> 18:05.001
Okay, so she's alive. And if she can
find us, then we can find her.

18:05.169 --> 18:06.841
It must be the fourth suit
that's after her.

18:07.369 --> 18:09.963
Maybe the combination
of our magic did this to them.

18:10.169 --> 18:11.887
We need to figure out
who those suits are.

18:12.449 --> 18:15.759
Okay, Leo, you go ask your bosses,
whoever they are, whatever they are,

18:15.969 --> 18:18.529
who those guys are,
and how we get our sister back. Now.

18:18.729 --> 18:20.685
Orb. Faster.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.806
- Wind.
- Wind?

18:27.009 --> 18:29.648
- Can you think of anything else?
- Mist.

18:30.089 --> 18:31.363
I've checked everywhere.

18:31.529 --> 18:34.407
- I can't figure out what happened.
- I'm telling you, it is the witches.

18:34.569 --> 18:36.764
- They did this, they must know.
- What?

18:36.969 --> 18:39.961
We're losing momentum
across the board, especially in war.

18:40.129 --> 18:42.518
Peace has broken out
in several areas this afternoon.

18:43.449 --> 18:44.677
Damn it.

18:44.849 --> 18:46.487
If we're going down,
we're not going alone.

18:46.649 --> 18:48.719
Let's find those damn witches
and take them down too.

18:48.889 --> 18:50.880
Renewed fighting in the war.

18:53.329 --> 18:55.126
War drags on.

18:59.089 --> 19:01.239
War. It's him, he's alive.

19:03.049 --> 19:04.323
- In the war.

19:04.689 --> 19:06.122
- War.
- War.

19:06.289 --> 19:08.007
- Help.
- Hang in there, partner.

19:08.169 --> 19:10.524
We'll get you back,
then we'll punish those witches.

19:10.729 --> 19:13.289
No, cease-fire. Cooperation.

19:13.769 --> 19:16.408
Wait, you want us
to work with the witches?

19:17.129 --> 19:18.767
Need them to free me.

19:20.769 --> 19:22.088
How are we supposed to find them?

19:22.409 --> 19:25.685
Ask the Source.

19:29.089 --> 19:30.920
I still haven't found
our four adversaries,

19:31.089 --> 19:33.080
but I think I have an idea
of where Prue might be.

19:33.289 --> 19:36.998
And how to get her back? We have to
do that before this thing hurts her.

19:37.209 --> 19:40.042
Well, remember when Leo said
that Prue might be on another plane?

19:40.249 --> 19:42.160
Well, maybe we
banished her somehow.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.406
Now, there are 11 planes
of existence...

19:44.609 --> 19:47.407
Eleven planes? We don't have time
to search 11 planes.

19:48.729 --> 19:52.278
Prue's been quiet for a really long time.
Maybe we're too late.

19:52.649 --> 19:53.877
Piper, stay with me.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.483
Okay? We cannot give up.

20:01.729 --> 20:02.923
Did you find out where she is?

20:03.129 --> 20:05.120
No. But I have a message
from them.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.162
- She's not...?
- No, no.

20:08.369 --> 20:11.486
While I was there, they were contacted
by their counterparts on the other side.

20:11.649 --> 20:14.083
Are you telling me evil called good,
and good answered?

20:14.609 --> 20:16.679
Look, these suits that you're
dealing with

20:16.849 --> 20:20.637
have the highest possible connections.
Their bosses talked to my bosses.

20:20.849 --> 20:23.647
- About Prue?
- About the whole situation.

20:23.849 --> 20:25.328
They wanna have
a meeting with you.

20:25.489 --> 20:28.128
What could they want from us?
They already have Prue.

20:28.329 --> 20:30.797
Prue and their partner
are trapped in a netherworld

20:30.969 --> 20:32.288
between good and evil.

20:32.489 --> 20:36.118
And the only way to release them
is for good and evil to cooperate.

20:37.689 --> 20:39.327
You have to work with the suits.

20:39.489 --> 20:40.922
Are we allowed to do that?

20:41.089 --> 20:43.045
Look, all they told me
was to give you the message,

20:43.209 --> 20:45.564
and to let you decide
whether you wanted to do it.

20:46.689 --> 20:49.249
Did they mention what
they think we should do?

20:49.929 --> 20:52.204
Free will, it's a big thing with them.

20:52.409 --> 20:55.207
Wonderful. So where's the meeting?

20:56.289 --> 20:59.087
- You're gonna do it?
- Did you show up to the party late?

20:59.249 --> 21:00.648
Of course we're gonna do it.

21:00.809 --> 21:04.006
You can never get into bed with evil,
you know that. It could be a trap.

21:05.129 --> 21:07.484
Leo, thank you for your opinion,
but your bosses did say

21:07.649 --> 21:10.925
they were leaving the decision
up to us, so maybe you should too.

21:11.089 --> 21:15.002
Look, I can't. The last time that you
went up against this evil, you lost Prue.

21:15.209 --> 21:17.677
All right, now, and you're gonna
go up against it again?

21:17.889 --> 21:19.481
Both of you could be lost this time.

21:20.209 --> 21:23.519
We're not gonna go up against them,
we're gonna work with them, right?

21:23.969 --> 21:25.448
But they'll betray you.

21:25.609 --> 21:27.645
All right? This is how evil works.

21:27.849 --> 21:30.522
This is why evil
loves free will so much.

21:30.689 --> 21:33.044
Because humans use it
to follow their heart.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.165
And evil takes advantage of that.

21:35.369 --> 21:36.882
So, Leo, what are our options?

21:37.089 --> 21:39.398
You have to try
and save her by yourselves.

21:39.609 --> 21:42.726
But, Leo, we don't know how.
We have to work with them.

21:43.209 --> 21:44.881
But you don't even know
who they are.

21:45.049 --> 21:46.607
We tried, but they
weren't in the book.

21:46.769 --> 21:50.079
Which means they probably aren't
even demons or warlocks anyway.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.522
Okay, then, what are they?

21:56.969 --> 21:59.642
Look, in the hierarchy of evil,

21:59.809 --> 22:02.448
there are several species
greater than demons.

22:03.529 --> 22:06.362
Ferocious, impossible to vanquish.

22:06.969 --> 22:11.087
And these went to extraordinary
lengths to ask for this meeting.

22:11.249 --> 22:13.717
Who knows what will happen
when the four of them are reunited?

22:13.929 --> 22:16.238
I don't care what happens,
we just want Prue back.

22:16.449 --> 22:18.280
So do I, but this is not the way.

22:18.489 --> 22:21.162
Leo, it's the only way we know.

22:22.489 --> 22:23.808
We have to save Prue.

22:32.249 --> 22:34.285
This is where we were
supposed to come, right?

22:34.449 --> 22:35.962
- Right.
- And it's not a trap, right?

22:36.129 --> 22:38.404
Please tell me
we're doing the right thing.

22:38.889 --> 22:42.359
Or we're making
the biggest mistake in the world.

22:43.289 --> 22:46.167
Thank you for coming. And you are?

22:46.329 --> 22:48.001
Anxious to get this over with.
Let's go.

22:48.169 --> 22:49.727
- Are you in a hurry?
- You stalling?

22:49.889 --> 22:53.006
- Do you want your sister back?
- Do you want your friend back?

22:57.409 --> 22:58.683
Let's do business.

23:21.409 --> 23:22.967
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing?

23:23.289 --> 23:25.086
Just making room.

23:26.129 --> 23:27.482
Of course.

23:32.249 --> 23:33.477
Taking notes.

23:35.009 --> 23:37.318
- Of course.
- Old habits are hard to break.

23:37.489 --> 23:41.243
I'm sure we can put that all aside
and get this done.

23:41.449 --> 23:43.804
Or die trying.

23:50.489 --> 23:52.878
You know, it's bad enough
working with them,

23:53.049 --> 23:54.448
but to bring them here?

23:54.609 --> 23:56.725
To the manor where
we're the strongest and the safest?

23:56.889 --> 23:59.449
Or maybe we should've gone
to their place, not that they offered.

23:59.609 --> 24:01.281
And why not?

24:01.449 --> 24:03.724
Why give up home-field advantage
unless you're hiding something?

24:03.889 --> 24:06.403
Of course they're hiding something,
they're evil.

24:07.769 --> 24:10.283
Okay, if we can reconstruct
exactly what happened in the alley,

24:10.449 --> 24:14.567
we might be able to figure out
what sent them away and undo that.

24:15.569 --> 24:17.161
I was standing there.

24:18.089 --> 24:19.522
No, actually, I was there.

24:19.729 --> 24:21.128
You were here.

24:22.449 --> 24:23.768
No, he's right.

24:24.689 --> 24:27.249
It was more like... this.

24:27.449 --> 24:29.758
Okay, you know what?
If we can't agree on this,

24:29.929 --> 24:31.282
we're not gonna get anything done.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.407
Okay, it was more like this.

24:36.969 --> 24:38.960
It was here... here...

24:40.209 --> 24:43.918
...and our missing friends
were here.

24:45.849 --> 24:48.488
- Phoebe?
- I see it, Piper.

24:48.689 --> 24:50.008
What? What do you see?

25:00.329 --> 25:02.843
A pentagram, our lucky sign.

25:03.049 --> 25:06.007
Actually, a pentagram
was a sign of good energy until

25:06.169 --> 25:07.921
- your side stole it.
- Okay.

25:08.129 --> 25:10.643
Is it possible that the five of us,
by forming a pentagram,

25:10.809 --> 25:13.528
somehow created
some weird, magical energy field?

25:13.729 --> 25:16.163
With Prue and your friend
in the middle.

25:16.329 --> 25:17.523
There must've been a vortex.

25:17.969 --> 25:20.529
Okay, if we could figure out
how we opened it,

25:20.689 --> 25:22.520
maybe we could figure out
how to open it again.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.278
- And release them.
- And who knows what else.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.088
This is good, keep it up.

25:29.249 --> 25:30.967
I'll check things back at the office.

25:31.129 --> 25:32.642
Page me when you have the answer.

25:33.609 --> 25:35.201
Ladies.

25:39.169 --> 25:40.397
I'm leaving too.

25:43.369 --> 25:45.485
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna follow this guy back

25:45.649 --> 25:47.401
and find out who he is.

25:48.969 --> 25:50.368
What is he?

25:51.689 --> 25:53.122
He is none of your business.

25:53.289 --> 25:56.838
Okay, since this is supposed to be a
joint effort, what is your contribution?

25:57.009 --> 26:00.126
Perhaps it was the combination
of our chants that opened this vortex.

26:00.289 --> 26:02.120
What language
were you chanting in?

26:02.369 --> 26:04.041
Actually, it's a dead language

26:04.209 --> 26:06.643
that we sometimes use
for ceremonial purposes.

26:07.649 --> 26:08.798
How festive.

26:09.449 --> 26:11.565
I'll tell you mine, if you tell me yours.

26:12.929 --> 26:14.248
Okay, while you two do that,

26:14.409 --> 26:16.684
I'll go remake the potion
because we're going to need it.

26:16.889 --> 26:19.244
- Mind if I watch?
- Yes, I do.

26:25.489 --> 26:28.526
Perhaps the largest peacetime
loss of life...

26:30.329 --> 26:33.480
Put the military in control
of the government...

26:34.169 --> 26:36.637
Who the hell are you and what...?

26:41.409 --> 26:42.637
Sir.

26:45.489 --> 26:50.165
It's your standard chant
to destroy the common witch.

26:50.329 --> 26:53.082
Clearly, you're
no common witch, though.

26:55.969 --> 26:57.607
Thank you.

26:58.689 --> 27:00.520
Okay, the first line.

27:00.689 --> 27:02.407
I'll interpret.

27:02.609 --> 27:06.841
"I call you, servants of the unholy,"
and then...

27:07.009 --> 27:08.681
Now...

27:09.089 --> 27:11.728
...being a bad guy and all,

27:11.889 --> 27:13.925
you wouldn't happen to be
lying to me, would you?

27:15.809 --> 27:18.562
Well, being a bad guy and all,

27:18.729 --> 27:21.766
would you believe me
if I told you no?

27:30.569 --> 27:34.278
I don't like these numbers at all. I gave
specific instructions to spread cholera,

27:34.489 --> 27:36.445
especially in Central Asia.
What happened?

27:36.929 --> 27:38.203
I'm asking you a question.

27:38.369 --> 27:40.803
If somebody is vaccinating
these people, I wanna know about it.

27:40.969 --> 27:42.607
Find out. Now.

27:43.689 --> 27:48.160
The smallpox outbreak in Venezuela,
let it spread.

28:01.969 --> 28:05.166
- What is that? Tattoo?
- Yes.

28:07.049 --> 28:10.678
- What does it mean?
- Nothing. It goes with the job.

28:12.569 --> 28:13.684
What are you doing?

28:13.849 --> 28:17.888
I am re-creating the potion I made
for our first meeting.

28:18.049 --> 28:20.279
I think it might help get Prue and...

28:20.489 --> 28:22.559
- Our friend.
...back.

28:24.489 --> 28:25.842
So, what are you four up to?

28:26.009 --> 28:27.761
You really expect me to answer that?

28:27.929 --> 28:29.487
We're supposed to be
working together,

28:29.689 --> 28:31.645
and we don't know anything
about each other.

28:31.849 --> 28:33.168
I know you're a witch.

28:33.369 --> 28:34.643
- And you are?
- Not.

28:34.809 --> 28:38.404
Look, we just want our partner back.
That's all you need to know.

28:38.569 --> 28:40.446
It's all business, just like it is for you.

28:41.049 --> 28:43.563
No, she's our sister,
it's completely personal.

28:43.929 --> 28:46.284
Every mortal's weakness.

28:46.449 --> 28:48.804
That's why you always lose.

28:53.209 --> 28:56.087
So this is great.
We both did spells at the same time,

28:56.249 --> 28:59.559
but we did it on the wrong people.
So I think that we...

29:00.929 --> 29:03.397
Am I the only one
that's working here?

29:03.569 --> 29:04.968
Have you always been a witch?

29:05.329 --> 29:07.001
What? Why?

29:07.489 --> 29:10.003
I don't know, something about you.

29:10.169 --> 29:11.397
You ever been a demon?

29:12.449 --> 29:14.440
I think we need to get back
to our chants.

29:14.969 --> 29:16.721
Meaning yes?

29:16.889 --> 29:19.562
No. I have never been a demon.

29:20.409 --> 29:22.081
- You know, we're not that different.
- No.

29:22.929 --> 29:26.399
We're both trying
to undo the other side.

29:27.369 --> 29:29.087
A worthy challenge.

29:30.329 --> 29:33.002
I think I figured out...

29:33.809 --> 29:36.277
...how good and evil mix together.

29:36.849 --> 29:38.840
To such powerful results.

29:40.009 --> 29:41.408
I know how to undo that.

29:55.969 --> 29:57.197
You all right?

29:57.889 --> 29:59.242
No.

29:59.889 --> 30:01.163
I'm a bit queasy.

30:30.929 --> 30:32.248
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

30:36.089 --> 30:38.398
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything. What did you do?

30:42.969 --> 30:44.641
- What happened?
- Hard to say.

30:44.849 --> 30:46.999
- Are you all right?
- I'm not sure.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.487
So do you have an answer yet?

30:52.289 --> 30:53.642
Reverse polarity.

30:54.209 --> 30:56.643
- In the pentagram.
- And in the chants.

30:56.849 --> 31:00.524
If we stand in the opposite points and
say the opposite words in the chant,

31:00.689 --> 31:02.202
"save" instead of
"vanquish" and so on...

31:02.369 --> 31:06.328
That will reopen the vortex,
we will get them back,

31:06.489 --> 31:08.207
then we can get back to business.

31:09.169 --> 31:10.602
And we could get on with our lives.

31:12.129 --> 31:13.357
It's 6:00 now.

31:13.529 --> 31:16.487
So why don't we go back
to the office, get organized,

31:16.649 --> 31:18.526
and we can all meet up
at 6:30 sharp?

31:20.209 --> 31:24.248
We... We have
an appointment at 7, so...

31:27.369 --> 31:28.848
Okay, what really happened?

31:29.049 --> 31:30.960
It was Prue. She was trying
to spell something out

31:31.129 --> 31:33.962
on the spirit board,
but all I got was "four, H, O."

31:35.369 --> 31:37.599
Four, H, O.

31:38.089 --> 31:39.408
Four hours?

31:40.049 --> 31:42.563
Maybe she feels that's
all the time she has left.

31:50.089 --> 31:52.319
Rescue facilities are
up to capacity,

31:52.489 --> 31:55.686
overflow victims
seek shelter in the streets.

31:55.889 --> 31:59.006
Dysentery and diphtheria
take their toll.

32:07.049 --> 32:08.243
It can't be.

32:10.009 --> 32:12.477
Security breach. Grab him.

32:19.249 --> 32:22.446
Never mind him, keep working.
We're running out of time.

32:25.249 --> 32:28.047
Are you sure they're willing
to do their half?

32:28.209 --> 32:31.645
They seem to want this
as badly as we do.

32:34.929 --> 32:36.362
Great, you're here.

32:36.529 --> 32:38.724
We're done.
We have everything figured out.

32:38.889 --> 32:39.958
You sure?

32:40.129 --> 32:42.404
Leo, what are you wearing?
Where have you been?

32:42.569 --> 32:45.288
I just followed the black tie
back to his office.

32:45.729 --> 32:47.242
Leo, they'll think we don't trust them.

32:47.729 --> 32:50.402
And you shouldn't trust them, Piper.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.525
You wanna know who they are?

32:52.689 --> 32:55.567
They are the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

32:56.129 --> 32:57.847
The Four Hor...

32:58.249 --> 33:00.604
That's what Prue
was trying to tell us.

33:01.409 --> 33:02.842
Don't you understand
what's at stake?

33:03.049 --> 33:05.165
If you save Prue, you will release
the fourth Horseman

33:05.329 --> 33:06.887
and bring about the end of the world.

33:16.929 --> 33:18.521
I don't believe you.

33:18.689 --> 33:19.963
Leo, it doesn't change anything.

33:20.129 --> 33:23.405
We would help the Source himself
if we thought we could get Prue back.

33:23.569 --> 33:28.199
Listen, they wear the mark
of the Anointed Ones.

33:28.369 --> 33:30.837
The omega. It means the end.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.204
- The tattoo on the neck?
- Yes.

33:33.409 --> 33:35.240
The missing Horseman is War.

33:35.409 --> 33:38.640
You've been dealing with Strife,
Famine and Death.

33:38.849 --> 33:41.409
They're gonna begin the apocalypse
as soon as they're reunited.

33:41.569 --> 33:44.129
I thought dodging the Y2K bullet
bought us more time

33:44.289 --> 33:46.678
on the whole apocalypse thing.

33:46.849 --> 33:49.363
You know why nothing happened
on New Year's Eve?

33:49.889 --> 33:51.880
Because it wasn't
the real millennium.

33:52.089 --> 33:54.319
The monks who converted
the Julian calendar

33:54.489 --> 33:57.128
to the Gregorian calendar
made some critical errors.

33:57.329 --> 33:59.320
So when does
the new millennium start?

33:59.529 --> 34:01.804
- Tonight, approximately at...
- Seven o'clock.

34:02.449 --> 34:04.758
Which is probably why
they wanna meet us at 6:30.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.962
Right, then all four Horsemen can be
in place to begin the apocalypse.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.926
You cannot let that happen.

34:10.129 --> 34:12.563
- Leo, we know what we're doing.
- No, you don't.

34:12.768 --> 34:15.601
You're thinking like sisters,
mortal sisters.

34:15.768 --> 34:17.360
Well, what are we
supposed to think like?

34:17.809 --> 34:19.639
Like the Charmed Ones.

34:19.849 --> 34:22.317
- You have a duty.
- To save our sister.

34:22.529 --> 34:25.362
Look, Leo, we've made up our mind.
We're gonna save Prue.

34:25.929 --> 34:27.760
It's not like we could
beat them without her.

34:28.529 --> 34:30.884
Look, only the Source
can vanquish them, Phoebe.

34:31.089 --> 34:32.841
For failing.

34:33.089 --> 34:35.239
Think of the times the world
has been on the brink.

34:35.409 --> 34:38.047
You know, Hitler,
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

34:38.649 --> 34:41.800
Each time, a team of Horsemen
has almost succeeded.

34:41.969 --> 34:46.087
And then failed and been destroyed
and replaced by a new team.

34:46.929 --> 34:49.159
So then we'll make sure
that they fail too.

34:49.369 --> 34:51.485
They are closer than any team
has ever been.

34:53.529 --> 34:55.884
Then we obviously need Prue
to beat them.

34:56.089 --> 34:58.045
Oh, my God. You have not heard
a thing I've said.

35:00.729 --> 35:01.957
Look...

35:02.649 --> 35:04.401
...I love Prue too.

35:04.569 --> 35:06.127
You know that.

35:06.289 --> 35:08.849
But just like when you went to
the future, you saw that sometimes

35:09.009 --> 35:11.569
there are more important things
than saving your sister.

35:18.409 --> 35:21.162
Give it up.
If War's not back soon, we're history.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.485
The Source is going to
burn us off the map.

35:23.649 --> 35:25.082
We are not going down alone.

35:25.289 --> 35:28.520
Instead of just standing here, let's go
hunt those witches down and kill them.

35:28.689 --> 35:31.886
I told you they'd double-cross us. It's
why they sent their man to spy on us.

35:32.089 --> 35:34.159
We were doing research,
it's just good business.

35:35.409 --> 35:36.728
Let's just kill them now.

35:36.889 --> 35:38.163
Oh, but you need us.

35:38.969 --> 35:41.278
You can't end the world without us.

35:41.849 --> 35:43.123
So you know who we are.

35:43.289 --> 35:44.608
Yeah, and we came anyway.

35:44.769 --> 35:46.885
See, on our side of things,
we call that "good faith."

35:47.089 --> 35:49.603
Call it whatever you want,
let's just do it. Hurry.

35:49.769 --> 35:52.124
- You ready?
- Bring it on.

36:00.329 --> 36:01.557
Battle stations.

36:02.129 --> 36:03.403
What did you see?

36:03.569 --> 36:05.844
Let's just get this over with.

36:13.729 --> 36:16.163
Sower of discord
Your help we implore

36:18.369 --> 36:20.325
- Phoebe.
- Leo's right.

36:20.729 --> 36:23.607
I saw what's gonna happen, Piper.
We can't do this. We can't be selfish.

36:25.449 --> 36:26.848
Why aren't you two chanting?

36:27.649 --> 36:30.322
You keep going. Why did you stop?

36:32.009 --> 36:33.044
We're running out of time.

36:33.209 --> 36:35.723
Do you know what you're doing?
You're killing your own sister.

36:38.049 --> 36:39.960
There's more at stake here
than sisterhood.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.127
I'm finished. Did they finish?

36:45.289 --> 36:47.757
No, and we're not going to.

36:49.129 --> 36:50.881
We had a deal. We shook on it.

36:52.609 --> 36:54.600
That was a mistake
in more ways than one.

36:54.769 --> 36:56.248
We know what you want,

36:56.409 --> 36:58.639
and we're gonna make sure
you don't get it.

37:00.089 --> 37:02.364
Even if that means
losing our sister forever.

37:04.769 --> 37:06.646
Look.

37:06.849 --> 37:09.283
They didn't finish their chant.
How can the vortex open?

37:09.569 --> 37:11.002
The Source is opening it.

37:11.209 --> 37:13.040
No!

37:17.009 --> 37:19.125
- What are you doing?
- Well, the vortex is open.

37:19.289 --> 37:22.167
If we finish it before they're destroyed,
maybe we could pull Prue out.

37:24.809 --> 37:27.846
Listen to me now
With these words of truce

37:50.329 --> 37:51.842
Prue, you all right?

37:52.009 --> 37:55.399
It's okay now,
everything's gonna be okay now.

37:55.729 --> 37:58.084
Thanks for saving my life.

38:18.449 --> 38:22.601
Look at them. They'll all live to dance
another day, and what do we get?

38:22.769 --> 38:24.168
We saved the whole darn world.

38:24.329 --> 38:27.241
The least we could get
is a thank-you, you know.

38:28.049 --> 38:29.801
- Ladies.
- Hey, Leo.

38:30.529 --> 38:32.679
I know this has been
hard on all of you.

38:32.889 --> 38:34.720
Yeah, well, we sort of made it
hard on you too.

38:35.049 --> 38:36.607
- Leo, it's just...
- It's okay, Piper,

38:36.769 --> 38:38.885
we were just doing our job.

38:39.729 --> 38:43.358
Okay. The master of understatement.
Is there anything else?

38:44.009 --> 38:46.125
No, I was just at a meeting.

38:46.289 --> 38:50.248
And they told me that it was
your act of complete selflessness

38:50.409 --> 38:52.798
that stopped the Source's plan
from going forward.

38:53.769 --> 38:55.441
So the Four Horsemen
were destroyed

38:55.609 --> 38:58.169
because Piper and Phoebe
were willing to sacrifice me?

38:59.809 --> 39:02.039
The Horsemen's bosses
said it was a sign there was still

39:02.209 --> 39:05.087
too much good in the world
to make the apocalypse successful.

39:05.249 --> 39:06.523
So are they giving up?

39:06.729 --> 39:09.801
No, in fact, they'll probably
try harder from now on.

39:11.529 --> 39:13.645
Do you wanna have
a drink with us, Leo?

39:13.809 --> 39:15.845
No, you need time together.

39:16.449 --> 39:17.802
Just you three.

39:21.049 --> 39:22.926
I'll see you.

39:25.769 --> 39:28.841
You know, you two faced
an incredibly hard thing...

39:30.249 --> 39:32.604
...and you made the right decision,
of your own free will.

39:33.249 --> 39:38.118
I am so, so, so sorry, Prue.

39:38.689 --> 39:42.807
- So am I.
- There's no apologies necessary.

39:42.969 --> 39:47.884
We were all just doing our jobs.
I just have to deal with it.

39:49.529 --> 39:51.008
Everyone has to vote on this.

39:51.169 --> 39:52.648
What if the building is on fire.

39:52.809 --> 39:55.482
Do you save five strangers
or one sibling?

39:55.969 --> 39:57.288
Five strangers.
