14:01.433 --> 14:02.500
We could try the foam again.

14:02.567 --> 14:03.900
JOHN: Guys,
this isn't the time.

14:03.967 --> 14:05.267
Ah, John's right.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.133
We've still had no word
from Brains if it's effective.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.967
Sorry, Scott, I really need
to work on my phrasing.

14:10.067 --> 14:12.267
What I meant to say is,

14:12.333 --> 14:14.067
you have a situation.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.733
Are we glad to see you guys.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.733
There are workers trapped on
the roof who need your help.

14:25.800 --> 14:30.567
International Rescue, you are
in violation of my directive.

14:30.633 --> 14:35.100
I'm escorting you
to the nearest base and
impounding your ship.

14:35.167 --> 14:38.500
Come peacefully
or be fired upon.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.067
Huh?
Huh?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.500
(ENGINE POWERING DOWN)

15:02.167 --> 15:06.900
International Rescue,
open the hatch
or be boarded by force.

15:06.967 --> 15:09.633
JOHN: Don't let Janus in.
Stall 'em while I
track down Lady P.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.700
Maybe her connections
will help.

15:11.767 --> 15:15.500
If she doesn't torpedo us
for rocking the exact boat
she told us not to.

15:15.567 --> 15:18.800
You have the right
to ground us
but not to enter our ship.

15:19.933 --> 15:22.067
Break open the hatch.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.167
(GRUNTING)

15:25.233 --> 15:27.333
Guys, the building's gonna
fall any moment.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.700
JOHN: And Janus hasn't
evacuated the workers.

15:29.767 --> 15:31.433
They need rescue now.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.233

(GROANS)

15:41.367 --> 15:43.067
Colonel,
you've made your point.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.467
But the construction crew...

15:44.533 --> 15:46.800
Is no longer your concern.

15:46.867 --> 15:48.267
I'm handling it.

15:48.333 --> 15:51.867
You are ordered to remain
where you are.

15:51.933 --> 15:53.633
Bring in the laser cutter.

15:56.800 --> 16:00.067
Ah, Janus runs Global Defense.
You heard him.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.200
He must have ordered
in a rescue team.

16:02.267 --> 16:04.500
On my own authority,
I'm arresting all of you

16:04.567 --> 16:06.933
and confiscating your ship
and equipment.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.300
Permanently.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.933
And I'm challenging your
authority to do so, Colonel.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.867
Yes! That's what
I'm talking about!

16:12.933 --> 16:14.500
(LASER WHIRS)

16:16.167 --> 16:19.233
Expect International Rescue
to resist.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.600
Scott, as far as I can tell,

16:20.667 --> 16:23.400
he's not lifting a finger
to help those trapped workers.

16:23.467 --> 16:26.267
Then this was never about us
violating Janus's rules.

16:26.333 --> 16:27.933
I think he's just
after Thunderbird 2.

16:28.067 --> 16:31.233
And he's willing to sacrifice
those people just to get it?

16:31.300 --> 16:33.167
Dad taught us
to respect authority.

16:33.233 --> 16:36.533
But Janus, he's not acting
like a good guy.

16:36.600 --> 16:40.467
If saving lives makes us
outlaws, so be it.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.867
Thunderbird 2, defense
Protocol Gamma.

16:42.933 --> 16:44.167
Light her up, Virgil.

16:44.233 --> 16:46.333
It would be my pleasure.

16:48.067 --> 16:49.733
We need to go in heavy.

(COLONEL SCREAMS)

16:54.100 --> 16:56.967
Thunderbird 5, we're going in.
Any luck with Lady Penelope?

16:57.067 --> 16:58.433
JOHN: As a matter of fact...

17:15.200 --> 17:16.633
Colonel Casey?

17:16.700 --> 17:19.100
Your presence here
is unauthorized.

17:19.167 --> 17:21.833
Turn around before
I have you arrested.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.433
I don't answer to impostors.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.233
Your credentials don't seem
to check out, Colonel.

17:26.300 --> 17:30.233
We'll be escorting you
back to headquarters
to answer a few questions.

17:31.833 --> 17:36.700
Chain of command must be
respected, eh, old chap?

17:36.767 --> 17:38.867
SCOTT: Colonel Casey,
Sa'd Madeena.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.267
Don't let us stop you,
International Rescue.

17:50.067 --> 17:52.800
Scott, my metallurgical
analysis shows the steel

17:52.867 --> 17:55.500
in the bridge had been
artificially fatigued.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.933
It was sabotage,
not our equipment.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.233
I knew it!

17:59.300 --> 18:00.667
Alan, Gordon, you're up.

18:00.733 --> 18:02.167

19:44.433 --> 19:46.300
Not sure I'd wanna live in it.

19:46.367 --> 19:48.800
But at least it won't fall
on anyone.

19:48.867 --> 19:50.267
Good work, guys.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.600
COLONEL CASEY: Your father
would be darn proud

20:10.667 --> 20:12.100
of what you boys
did here today.

20:12.167 --> 20:15.267
Thank you, International
Rescue, for a job well done.

20:15.333 --> 20:18.700
Thank you, Colonel Casey.
We're always happy to help.

20:26.933 --> 20:29.700
If Martin Janus was an alias,
who is he really?

20:29.767 --> 20:31.167
Who do you think?

20:31.233 --> 20:32.733
If you're thinking The Hood,
that's a big negative.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.200
Just heard from Colonel Casey.
It's not him.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.667
We could lock you up
and throw away the key.

20:39.733 --> 20:43.000
Yet you hardly seem
the mastermind type.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.133
So, who's pulling
your strings?

20:45.200 --> 20:46.933
I'm nobody's puppet.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.800
Perhaps you'll
choose to cooperate

20:48.867 --> 20:52.333
when you realize your master
can't help you in here.

20:58.233 --> 21:00.867
-It's not that
I can't help you.
-Hood!

21:00.933 --> 21:04.933
I simply believe
it's bad policy to
reward incompetence.

21:05.067 --> 21:06.533
But I did as you asked.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.900
Oh, really?

21:07.967 --> 21:10.567
You disrupted
the Global Defense Force
from within,

21:10.633 --> 21:12.167
dismantled
International Rescue,

21:12.233 --> 21:14.467
and then delivered
all of their vehicles,

21:14.533 --> 21:16.500
as well as
their island base, to me?

21:16.567 --> 21:20.700
I saw an opportunity to grab
Thunderbird 2 and I took it.

21:20.767 --> 21:23.467
And how has that
worked out for you?

21:23.533 --> 21:25.467
The Colonel
will cut me a deal.

21:25.533 --> 21:28.067
If you leave me here,
I'll talk.

21:28.067 --> 21:30.233
And if she frees you,

21:30.300 --> 21:33.167
do you really believe
there's any place

21:33.233 --> 21:37.433
you can hide
that's beyond my reach?
