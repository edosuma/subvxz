WEBVTT

01:57.040 --> 02:00.044
We're going to Braavos!

02:05.160 --> 02:08.960
In the old times,
whenever Braavos stood in danger,

02:09.039 --> 02:12.522
the Titan would step with fire in his eyes.

02:12.880 --> 02:16.487
He'd wade into the sea
and smash the enemies.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.645
He's just a statue.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.846
Don't be afraid.
He's announcing our arrival.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.082
I'm not afraid.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.884
The House of Black and White.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.410
This is where you'll find the man you seek.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.447
Here I leave you.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.370
Thank you for bringing me.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.011
Any man of Braavos
would have done the same.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.161
Valar Morghulis.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.523
Valar Dohaeris.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.405
Hello.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.763
Valar Morghulis.

04:57.840 --> 04:58.921
Um...

05:03.400 --> 05:06.085
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.009
No one here by that name.

05:11.880 --> 05:12.881
Please.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.964
I crossed the Narrow Sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.963
You have everywhere else to go.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.730
But wait...

05:40.960 --> 05:42.564
Cersei.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.930
Walder Frey.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.524
The Mountain.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.210
Meryn Trant.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.444
Cersei.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.331
Walder Frey.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.245
The Mountain.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.531
Meryn Trant.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.490
Cersei. Walder Frey.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.130
The Mountain.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.490
Meryn Trant.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.684
Cersei.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.370
Walder Frey.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.170
The Mountain.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.890
Meryn Trant.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.170
Cersei.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.809
Walder Frey.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.849
The Mountain.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.930
Meryn Trant.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.520
Must be good food if it's crowded.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.320
Ale?

07:15.760 --> 07:17.330
Ale?

07:25.360 --> 07:28.011
Before we left,
a maester gave you a raven scroll.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.207
You are becoming an observant young lady.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.006
My mother used to say,
"Dark wings, dark words."

07:36.120 --> 07:39.522
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.530
Excuse me.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.886
So, it was good news?

07:44.520 --> 07:46.682
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.645
I thought you still mourned
the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.801
Ale?

07:51.480 --> 07:52.527
I'll have some.

07:56.840 --> 07:57.841
My lady.

07:59.360 --> 08:00.327
What is it?

08:00.400 --> 08:01.686
Sansa Stark. Don't look.

08:03.560 --> 08:04.561
You sure?

08:04.640 --> 08:06.165
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.685
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.046
Littlefinger?

08:09.120 --> 08:10.645
A bunch of knights with him.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.603
A bunch? What's a bunch, Podrick? Six? 20?

08:12.720 --> 08:14.961
Ten, I think. Too many.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.451
My lady, I don't think this is the right...

08:16.520 --> 08:19.364
- Ready the horses.
- We only have one horse.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.249
Find more.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.849
Do you like the taste?

08:28.920 --> 08:30.922
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.046
Why do men love it so much?

08:34.120 --> 08:36.168
It gives some men courage.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.522
Does it give you courage?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.201
That's far enough.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.090
Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.408
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.687
We've met with Renly Baratheon.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.002
What did he say about you?

08:55.080 --> 08:57.048
He said

08:57.120 --> 08:59.885
your loyalty came free of charge.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.806
Someone appears to have
paid quite a bit for it since then.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.164
Lady Sansa,

09:20.360 --> 09:22.124
before your mother's death,

09:22.200 --> 09:24.726
I was her sworn sword.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.724
I gave my word
I would find you and protect you.

09:28.040 --> 09:31.010
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

09:31.080 --> 09:33.765
and give my life for yours if need be.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.969
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.048
Please, Lady Brienne,

09:40.120 --> 09:42.407
no need for such formality.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.608
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?

09:44.680 --> 09:46.762
- I was.
- Strange.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.330
I knew Cat from the time we were children.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.169
She never mentioned you.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.163
It was after Renly's murder.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.321
Ah. Yes.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.130
You were accused of killing him.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.766
- I tried to save him.
- But you were accused.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.922
By men who didn't see what happened.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.490
And what did happen?

10:06.360 --> 10:08.283
He was murdered by a shadow.

10:08.680 --> 10:11.001
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.170
A shadow?

10:14.800 --> 10:16.848
With the face...

10:19.040 --> 10:21.202
This woman
swore to protect Renly.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.651
She failed.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.883
She swore to protect your mother.
She failed.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.040
Why would I want somebody
with your history of failure

10:29.120 --> 10:30.121
guarding Lady Sansa?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.362
Why should you have any say in her affairs?

10:32.440 --> 10:33.805
Because I am her uncle.

10:33.880 --> 10:37.362
I married her Aunt Lysa
shortly before my beloved's untimely death.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.444
We're family now, and you are an outsider.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.567
Forgive me, Lady Brienne,

10:41.640 --> 10:44.166
but experience has made me
wary of outsiders.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.326
Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone...

10:47.400 --> 10:48.401
No.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.609
Please, my lady. If I could explain...

10:50.680 --> 10:53.206
I saw you at Joffrey's wedding
bowing to the king.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.886
Neither of us wanted to be there.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.491
Sometimes we don't have a choice.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.483
And sometimes we do.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.604
You should leave.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.565
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.608
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.841
Why don't you stay?

11:20.560 --> 11:22.050
The man asked you to stay...

11:25.720 --> 11:27.370
Hyah! Hyah!

11:34.960 --> 11:36.291
Hyah! Hyah!

11:36.480 --> 11:37.925
After her!

11:51.000 --> 11:52.126
- Yah! Hah!
- Oh!

12:09.960 --> 12:12.088
- Stop!
- I'll take him!

12:13.440 --> 12:15.249
Podrick!

12:16.000 --> 12:17.684
Hold on to her!

12:21.000 --> 12:22.650
Take her!

12:38.280 --> 12:39.691
Keep moving!

12:51.360 --> 12:54.569
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

12:58.920 --> 13:02.083
That's a good boy. Come on. Come on.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.044
No, no, no, stop!

13:25.720 --> 13:27.210
I guess that means you're unarmed.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.971
Down, Podrick! Down!

13:49.760 --> 13:50.761
Podrick.

13:51.640 --> 13:52.926
Yes. my lady?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.164
You can stand now.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.241
Yes, my lady.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.603
Sansa Stark?

14:03.160 --> 14:05.527
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.967
I saw her riding on the East Road
with Littlefinger.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.087
We'll follow them.

14:09.280 --> 14:13.729
My lady,
If both Stark girls refused your service,

14:13.800 --> 14:15.325
maybe you're released from your vow.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.688
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

14:17.760 --> 14:18.761
But if they don't want your protection...

14:18.840 --> 14:21.047
Do you think she's safe with Littlefinger?

14:23.680 --> 14:25.330
No, my lady.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.129
Get your horse.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.488
A summons from the queen.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.767
There are only
two like it in the world.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.206
The one I'm wearing,
the one I gave to Myrcella.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.011
- It's a threat.
- Of course it's a threat.

15:05.880 --> 15:11.250
Our daughter's alone in Dorne
surrounded by people who hate our family.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.482
"It's a threat."

15:15.080 --> 15:16.081
No note?

15:16.160 --> 15:19.209
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

15:19.280 --> 15:22.443
and every other tragedy
that's befallen their cursed country.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.000
I will burn their cities to the ground
if they touch her.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.889
- Softer.
- What?

15:26.960 --> 15:27.961
Not so loud.

15:28.040 --> 15:30.884
Our daughter's in danger
and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly?

15:30.960 --> 15:33.247
The world can't know she's our daughter.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.927
Then don't call her your daughter.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.530
You've never been a father to her.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.080
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the street.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.202
And what has your caution brought?

15:44.720 --> 15:47.724
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.207
Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne.

15:51.520 --> 15:55.764
Our baby boy set to marry
that smirking whore from Highgarden.

16:04.840 --> 16:05.921
I'm going to make things better.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.490
You've never made anything better.

16:07.560 --> 16:11.042
I'm going to Dorne
and I'm bringing our daughter home.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.961
You can't just ask Prince Doran
to give her back.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.405
She's promised to his son.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.406
I'm not going to ask him anything.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.482
You go down there with an army,
it's an act of war.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.289
No army.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.521
Do you know where they're keeping her?

16:29.560 --> 16:32.404
- Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
- I'll find her.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.923
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.804
You're going to Dorne?

16:43.920 --> 16:47.367
A one-handed man, alone.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.602
I never said I was going alone.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.365
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.602
Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.

17:03.680 --> 17:07.366
And music. I adore music.
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.488
We can have a harp if you like,
but no flutes.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.881
Then there's the food.
Food is the most important thing.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.531
Don't you agree?
We're going to need pigeon pies.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.807
That's what they eat in
the capital, don't they?

17:18.400 --> 17:20.003
Don't they?

17:21.280 --> 17:22.327
Don't who?

17:22.400 --> 17:25.369
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.529
They certainly do, my dear.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.121
It's a fine place, isn't it?

17:33.200 --> 17:34.645
A fine place.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.291
I never thought I'd end up
settling down in a place like this.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.966
You won't.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.041
Pardon?

17:43.120 --> 17:45.088
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

17:45.160 --> 17:48.448
When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.931
She hates me.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.321
She calls me mean names,
and sometimes, even still,

17:52.400 --> 17:55.290
she pulls my hair when Mother's not looking.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.842
You know what I think?

17:58.920 --> 18:01.048
I think you're a good person.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.122
And your sister is a mean person.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.690
She is.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.603
I've been all over the world,

18:08.680 --> 18:10.728
and if there's one thing I've learned,

18:10.800 --> 18:12.962
it's that meanness comes around.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.809
People like your sister,

18:15.880 --> 18:19.362
they always get
what's coming to them eventually.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.408
One way or another.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.204
Who's that?

18:29.080 --> 18:31.162
Jaime fucking Lannister.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.810
- Ser Jaime.
- Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.480
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.005
Thank you.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.125
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

18:45.760 --> 18:46.886
A pleasure.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.404
Run along, love.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.802
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.004
When were you planning on getting married?

19:02.080 --> 19:04.401
- Just get on with it.
- On with what?

19:04.480 --> 19:05.970
What you're here for.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.970
There's no way this little visit could
possibly mean anything good for me.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.084
It's very good for you.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.243
- Lollys will be marrying Ser Willis Bracken.
- Mmm.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.641
We made a deal, your sister and I.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.241
I would have advised against that.

19:31.680 --> 19:32.761
How is this good for me?

19:32.840 --> 19:35.969
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.485
And when we return,

19:37.560 --> 19:41.087
I'm going to give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.282
Return from where?

19:46.480 --> 19:48.562
As far south as south goes.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.962
My future queen.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.723
You are beautiful.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.768
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

20:26.320 --> 20:29.688
Remove yourself from my path or I'll take
that long ax and I'll shove it up your...

20:29.760 --> 20:31.330
Captain.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.007
Let her pass.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.807
Your brother was murdered,

20:40.880 --> 20:45.329
and you sit here in the Water Gardens,
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

20:45.400 --> 20:49.610
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
By law, that is not murder.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.081
- Your brother.
- You don't have to remind me.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.004
He was my brother
long before he was anything to you.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.006
What will you do about his death?

20:57.080 --> 20:59.606
I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

20:59.680 --> 21:00.727
And then?

21:00.840 --> 21:02.285
You would have me go to war?

21:02.360 --> 21:03.725
The whole country would have you go to war.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.644
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.884
The Sand Snakes are with me.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.650
They have the love of their people.

21:12.720 --> 21:18.443
They will avenge their father while
you sit here in your chair doing nothing.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.691
Oberyn is dead,

21:24.800 --> 21:27.565
and this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens,

21:27.760 --> 21:31.446
eating our food, breathing our air.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.646
How many of your brothers and sisters
do they have to kill?

21:36.320 --> 21:37.765
Let me have her.

21:39.720 --> 21:43.327
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.122
I loved my brother.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.402
And you made him very happy.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.610
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

21:53.720 --> 21:57.088
But we do not mutilate little girls
for vengeance.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.445
Not here.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.171
Not while I rule.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.643
And how long will that be?

22:20.920 --> 22:22.922
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.290
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.283
Of course you haven't found
any Sons of the Harpy.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.763
You haven't, have you?

22:32.520 --> 22:35.524
My Second Sons, on the other hand,

22:35.600 --> 22:38.331
they drink, whore,

22:38.400 --> 22:40.209
fight in the streets,

22:40.280 --> 22:41.691
they blend in.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.161
They overhear things in taverns,

22:44.240 --> 22:47.926
follow people to nice, quiet alleys,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.048
break a few fingers,

22:50.120 --> 22:51.849
overhear a few more things.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.124
Before you know it...

23:14.600 --> 23:15.601
No one here.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.285
We go.

23:18.360 --> 23:21.125
In a hurry? You're afraid?

23:21.200 --> 23:23.168
Unsullied fear nothing.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.685
Right.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.131
That's your problem.

23:27.200 --> 23:31.171
You understood fear once long ago,
but you've forgotten what it means.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.526
Someone who's forgotten fear

23:35.040 --> 23:36.610
has forgotten how to hide.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.887
Fear is useful that way.

24:12.160 --> 24:15.323
Sons of the Harpy,
they want to put a collar back on my neck.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.083
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.446
It would send a message.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.161
I think you should exercise restraint,
Your Grace.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.287
Why?

24:24.400 --> 24:26.084
For one thing,
he may have valuable information.

24:26.160 --> 24:29.050
The Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.440
How do you know that?

24:30.520 --> 24:32.443
Because I questioned him.

24:32.880 --> 24:35.042
And the information you did get,
he is young and poor.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.161
He is born free.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.481
Why should he want to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

24:38.560 --> 24:39.925
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride

24:40.040 --> 24:41.849
was knowing that
there was someone lower than he was.

24:41.920 --> 24:42.967
They pay him.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.123
Great families afraid to do a thing.

24:45.520 --> 24:46.931
They pay poor men to do it for them.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.843
- And how do you know this?
- Everyone know this.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.968
I don't know it,
and I'm the head of a great family.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.361
We do not know
what this man did or didn't do.

24:53.440 --> 24:57.001
Give him a trial at least. A fair trial.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.285
Show all the citizens of Meereen

24:59.360 --> 25:01.761
that you're better than
those who would depose you.

25:01.840 --> 25:02.921
Teach them a better way.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.447
I do not know the place
from where Old Ser comes.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.923
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.002
But here in Meereen,

25:11.080 --> 25:14.004
before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.401
So we learn much about them,

25:16.480 --> 25:18.608
or we do not live long.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.808
They teach me what they are.

25:21.120 --> 25:25.125
Mercy, fair trial, these
mean nothing to them.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.441
All they understand is blood.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.762
Thank you all for your counsel.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.721
Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.491
- About what?
- About your father.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.528
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

25:50.600 --> 25:52.125
You're here to remind me
of my enemies' lies?

25:52.360 --> 25:53.486
Consider me reminded.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.449
Your Grace,

25:55.520 --> 25:58.000
I served in his Kingsguard.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.605
I was at his side from the first.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.122
Your enemies did not lie.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.251
Go on.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.805
When the people rose in revolt against him,

26:09.960 --> 26:13.407
your father set their
towns and castles aflame.

26:13.480 --> 26:16.802
He murdered sons in front of their fathers.

26:16.880 --> 26:19.201
He burned men alive with wildfire

26:19.280 --> 26:21.009
and laughed as they screamed.

26:22.160 --> 26:25.642
And his efforts to stamp out dissent

26:25.720 --> 26:30.044
led to rebellion
that killed every Targaryen except two.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.685
I'm not my father.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.525
No, Your Grace. Thank the gods.

26:36.400 --> 26:40.530
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.400
And each time,
it made him feel powerful and right.

26:45.640 --> 26:47.051
Until the very end.

26:52.080 --> 26:55.880
I will not have the Son of the Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.482
Your Grace.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.046
There's a bug.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.610
Yes, best be careful.

27:13.680 --> 27:16.490
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

27:16.560 --> 27:21.361
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

27:25.480 --> 27:26.766
Besides,

27:27.080 --> 27:30.482
what else is there for me to do
inside this fucking box?

27:30.560 --> 27:31.607
You don't like it?

27:31.680 --> 27:33.728
- I want to take a walk.
- You can't.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.447
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.488
She ought to offer her cunt.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.767
Best part of her for the best part of me.

27:42.600 --> 27:46.491
Well, I suppose a box
is as good a place for me as anywhere.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.206
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to Volantis

27:49.280 --> 27:51.282
talking about the futility of everything?

27:51.360 --> 27:52.566
You're right. No point.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.483
The road to Volantis?

27:55.640 --> 27:58.530
You said we were going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

27:58.600 --> 28:00.011
The road to Meereen.

28:00.080 --> 28:03.562
And what do you hope to find
at the end of the road to Meereen?

28:03.760 --> 28:05.842
I told you. A ruler.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.206
We've already got a ruler.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.731
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

28:10.800 --> 28:15.124
Every pile of shit on the side of every road
has someones banner hanging from it.

28:15.480 --> 28:19.451
You were quite good, you know, at ruling.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.484
During your brief tenure as Hand.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.085
I didn't rule. I was a servant.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.527
Still, a man of talent.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.085
Managed to kill a lot of people.

28:28.160 --> 28:32.131
Yes, but you showed great promise
in other areas as well.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.410
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.609
She begged me.

28:40.680 --> 28:41.841
I wouldn't go.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.481
Why?

28:43.560 --> 28:45.050
'Cause I liked it.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.729
Power.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.882
Even as a servant.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.042
People follow leaders.

28:52.960 --> 28:56.521
And they will never follow us.
They find us repulsive.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.926
I find us repulsive.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.923
And we find them repulsive,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.288
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

29:03.360 --> 29:04.486
to keep them away.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.488
And yet,

29:07.560 --> 29:09.767
no matter what we do,

29:09.840 --> 29:14.243
people like you and me
are never really satisfied inside the box.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.924
Not for long.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.929
You're right.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.321
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

29:21.400 --> 29:24.609
How many dwarves are there in the world?

29:24.680 --> 29:27.365
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

29:31.320 --> 29:32.845
Not him.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.849
Are you trying to deceive your queen?

29:35.280 --> 29:37.601
Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

29:37.680 --> 29:38.806
That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.210
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.805
Mistakes will be made.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.609
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you, Your Grace.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.324
- Take the head.
- Pardon me, Your Grace.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.402
I would take it, if you don't mind.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.721
It could prove useful for my work.

29:52.760 --> 29:53.761
Very good.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.248
Over there will be fine.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.560
You heard the man. Over there.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.725
You're the Hand of the King?

30:31.800 --> 30:33.290
No, Uncle.

30:33.360 --> 30:37.046
Clearly it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.168
I'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

30:39.240 --> 30:40.844
and chooses a Hand for himself.

30:41.360 --> 30:44.364
Your Grace,
I would be willing to serve provisionally

30:44.440 --> 30:46.602
as the King's Hand
until he becomes old enough...

30:46.680 --> 30:48.125
You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

30:48.240 --> 30:49.605
but I don't imagine you'll have the time.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.527
In addition to being Master of Ships,

30:52.600 --> 30:55.331
the king has appointed you Master of Coin.

30:56.920 --> 30:57.967
Oh, Your Grace.

30:58.040 --> 31:01.442
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

31:02.240 --> 31:06.211
He said he would be honored to have you
represent the crown's interests in the same.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.282
The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.643
Your Grace,
in the past on several occasions,

31:11.720 --> 31:14.246
a grand maester has served
as the King's Hand.

31:14.320 --> 31:18.120
The king has named Qyburn
the new Master of Whisperers.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.731
Your Grace, him? This man?

31:23.800 --> 31:27.009
This embarrassment to the Citadel?

31:27.080 --> 31:32.086
Your Grace, what qualifications
can he possibly have for this post?

31:32.200 --> 31:34.282
The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester.

31:34.840 --> 31:36.888
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.482
Far more than many ever have.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.323
I must say, I cannot see...

31:42.400 --> 31:46.724
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position
as commander of the Lannister armies,

31:46.840 --> 31:50.322
it would please the king
if you would serve as his Master of War.

31:50.400 --> 31:53.563
No man living better deserves the title.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.842
That is kind of you to say.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.207
I would like to hear it
from the king himself.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.566
The king is very busy at this moment.

31:59.680 --> 32:02.081
He should be here
learning what it means to rule.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.605
He is learning.

32:03.680 --> 32:08.368
On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

32:08.520 --> 32:12.127
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother.

32:12.240 --> 32:15.289
And to you. And to serve the king.

32:15.360 --> 32:18.250
I did not return to serve as your puppet.

32:18.880 --> 32:22.646
To watch you stack the Small Council
with sycophants.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.771
Sending your own brother away
so he wouldn't be...

32:24.960 --> 32:26.610
My brother has left the capital to

32:27.000 --> 32:28.923
lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.001
What mission?

32:30.080 --> 32:32.845
That is not your concern as Master of War.

32:34.480 --> 32:39.566
I do not recognize your authority
to dictate what is and is not my concern.

32:40.040 --> 32:43.169
You are the Queen Mother, nothing more.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.611
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

32:49.720 --> 32:52.963
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.043
At Casterly Rock.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.120
Come on, you know this one.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.529
It looks like an animal.

33:11.120 --> 33:13.043
Snake.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.208
Snake.S.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.926
- It's an S.
- Right, very good.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.041
Huh!

33:19.920 --> 33:23.049
Did you know that the youngest
Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark,

33:23.120 --> 33:24.690
was elected at the age of 10?

33:26.760 --> 33:28.603
I know S.

33:28.680 --> 33:30.330
You'll learn, I promise.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.483
I taught Ser Davos, and old people
are terrible at learning new things.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.688
Well, you're a wonderful teacher.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.406
Very patient.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.290
I only said that the more time
that you spend practicing,

33:41.360 --> 33:42.566
the faster you'll be able to read.

33:42.640 --> 33:45.450
That's all right. We're doing just fine.

33:45.600 --> 33:50.481
I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
have a lot to talk about.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.247
How old were you
when you learned how to read?

33:55.320 --> 33:56.810
- Three.
- Three?

33:56.960 --> 33:58.291
Who taught you, your mother?

33:59.120 --> 34:02.124
No, old Maester Cressen did.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.690
I had a lot of time to practice.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.922
My mother kept me inside because...

34:08.440 --> 34:12.411
What do you call it in the south,
what happened to your face?

34:12.480 --> 34:14.402
Greyscale.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.289
What do you call it north of the Wall?

34:17.040 --> 34:18.768
I don't know.

34:19.239 --> 34:20.889
But two of my sisters had it.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.724
They both died.

34:22.800 --> 34:23.960
How did they cure you?

34:24.360 --> 34:27.091
I don't remember. I was a baby.

34:27.159 --> 34:29.242
Lots of people came and tried, I think.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.487
Whatever they did, it went away.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.005
What happened to your sisters?

34:37.360 --> 34:42.161
My father made them move out of the keep
into the hut outside.

34:42.239 --> 34:44.447
None of us were allowed to go near them.

34:44.560 --> 34:48.007
But we heard them, especially at night.

34:49.120 --> 34:52.726
They started to sound not like themselves.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.206
Did you ever see them?

34:56.520 --> 34:58.727
Only once at the end.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.525
They were covered with it.

35:02.840 --> 35:06.049
Their faces, their arms.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.811
They acted like animals.

35:09.320 --> 35:12.529
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.008
What did he do with them in the woods?

35:20.720 --> 35:22.882
- Mother.
- Leave us.

35:26.760 --> 35:27.807
Your Grace.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.290
You need to stay away from that girl.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.725
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.963
Her name is Gilly. She's nice.
I'm teaching her to read.

35:36.040 --> 35:39.362
She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.205
He executed their king for treason.

35:42.280 --> 35:45.124
They could strike at him by striking at you.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.089
Gilly wouldn't do that.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.847
You have no idea what people will do.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.927
All your books and you still don't know.

36:00.120 --> 36:02.726
I ordered Mance Rayder
burned at the stake.

36:02.800 --> 36:05.041
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.441
You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.121
A king's word is law.

36:10.200 --> 36:14.125
Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.882
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.883
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

36:22.720 --> 36:23.801
With respect, Your Grace,

36:23.880 --> 36:27.362
the free folk will never follow you
no matter what you do.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.330
You're the man who burned their king alive.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.685
Who, then?

36:33.280 --> 36:34.281
You?

36:35.040 --> 36:36.405
No.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.968
Only one of their own.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.288
Do you know this wretched girl,

36:43.320 --> 36:44.367
Lyanna Mormont?

36:44.560 --> 36:46.369
The Lord Commander's niece.

36:46.440 --> 36:49.887
Lady of Bear Island and a child of 10.

36:51.440 --> 36:54.523
I asked her to commit her house to my cause.
That's her response.

36:54.600 --> 36:57.604
"Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

36:57.680 --> 36:59.887
"whose name is Stark."

37:00.080 --> 37:01.684
That amuses you?

37:03.640 --> 37:05.642
I apologize, Your Grace.

37:06.280 --> 37:10.808
Northerners can be a bit like the free folk.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.644
Loyal to their own.

37:12.840 --> 37:13.841
I know.

37:13.960 --> 37:18.363
My brother, Robert, went on often and loudly
about how difficult it was to control them.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.682
Even with your father's help.

37:25.480 --> 37:29.405
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elects a new Lord Commander.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.209
Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.

37:31.280 --> 37:33.806
- Most likely.
- Unpleasant man.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.451
He thinks you're a traitor.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.410
What's your life going to be like here
at the Wall with Thorne in command?

37:39.480 --> 37:40.891
Unpleasant, I expect.

37:40.960 --> 37:43.008
Your bravery made him look weak.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.844
He'll punish you for it.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.649
I don't punish men for bravery.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.644
I reward them.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.848
I don't doubt it, Your Grace.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.768
But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.968
I pledged them my life, my honor, my sword.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.210
I don't know what I have left to give you.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.847
You can give me the North.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.370
I can't.

38:05.520 --> 38:09.047
Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard, a Snow.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.326
Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.529
Pledge me your service
and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

38:15.600 --> 38:17.443
Lord of Winterfell.

38:22.760 --> 38:25.491
He'll make you a Stark
with the stroke of a pen?

38:25.560 --> 38:28.131
It's the first thing
I ever remember wanting.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.884
I'd daydream that my father
would ask the king

38:31.960 --> 38:35.248
and just like that, I would never be
the Bastard of Winterfell again.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.607
You deserve this. You do.

38:37.680 --> 38:40.331
I couldn't be happier for you.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.607
I'm going to refuse him.

38:44.240 --> 38:48.086
But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.481
I swore a vow to the Night's Watch.

38:50.560 --> 38:54.281
If I don't take my own word seriously,
what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?

38:59.520 --> 39:02.808
Crowded. You'd think
we were serving venison stew.

39:09.680 --> 39:14.288
Does anyone wish to speak for candidates

39:14.440 --> 39:17.205
before we cast our tokens

39:17.280 --> 39:23.003
for the 998th Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

39:25.680 --> 39:28.843
Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight,
he's a man of true nobility.

39:29.360 --> 39:32.364
He was acting commander
when the Wall came under attack

39:32.440 --> 39:34.204
and led us to victory against the wildlings.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.281
Hear, hear.

39:35.360 --> 39:36.691
He's a veteran of 100 battles

39:36.760 --> 39:39.969
and has been a defender of the Watch
and the Wall almost all of his life.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.485
Aye.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.131
He's the only true choice.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.281
Yes!

39:48.040 --> 39:50.247
Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch
as a boy

39:50.720 --> 39:53.690
and has served loyally,
longer than any other ranger.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.449
Through 10 winters he served.

39:56.520 --> 40:00.002
As commander of the Shadow Tower,
he kept the wildlings away.

40:00.720 --> 40:01.721
We could do no better.

40:06.440 --> 40:09.842
If there is no one else,
we will begin the voting.

40:10.240 --> 40:15.326
The triangular tokens
count for Ser Alliser Thorne.

40:15.600 --> 40:19.321
The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.165
- Each brother will...
- Maester Aemon.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.849
Samwell Tarly. Go on.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.648
Sam the Slayer.

40:30.680 --> 40:33.445
Another wildling lover
just like his friend Jon Snow.

40:33.840 --> 40:36.161
How's your lady love, Slayer?

40:36.240 --> 40:38.208
Her name is Gilly.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.170
Brother Slynt knows her quite well.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.490
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the Wall.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.608
Lies!

40:45.680 --> 40:49.890
A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos.

40:50.840 --> 40:54.049
I found him there after the battle was over
in a puddle of his own making.

40:58.680 --> 41:03.607
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding
with the women and children,

41:03.680 --> 41:04.727
Jon Snow was leading.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.362
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true.

41:08.440 --> 41:11.171
And when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

41:11.440 --> 41:15.889
He took charge of the Wall's defense.
He killed the Magnar of the Thenns.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.207
He went north to deal with Mance Rayder

41:18.280 --> 41:21.250
knowing it almost certainly
meant his own death.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.131
Before that,

41:27.320 --> 41:30.642
he led the mission to
avenge Lord Commander Mormont.

41:32.080 --> 41:35.050
Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward.

41:35.120 --> 41:38.681
He saw something in Jon
and now we've all seen it, too.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.084
He may be young.

41:41.920 --> 41:45.288
But he's the commander we turned to
when the night was darkest.

41:53.440 --> 41:56.649
I can't argue with any of that.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.127
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

42:00.760 --> 42:02.205
Night's Watch,

42:03.920 --> 42:05.285
or the wildlings?

42:06.000 --> 42:09.322
Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl,

42:09.400 --> 42:11.323
he spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

42:11.400 --> 42:15.166
What would have happened in that tent
between those two old friends

42:15.240 --> 42:17.322
if Stannis' army hadn't come along?

42:17.440 --> 42:21.968
We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall
out of his misery.

42:22.480 --> 42:25.962
Do you want to choose a man
who has fought the wildlings all his life,

42:26.520 --> 42:28.204
or a man who makes love to them?

42:36.480 --> 42:37.811
It is time.

43:24.640 --> 43:27.769
It appears to be a tie, Maester.

43:47.200 --> 43:51.603
Jon Snow!
Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

44:21.960 --> 44:24.804
You. You.

44:27.760 --> 44:28.761
What have you got there?

44:32.240 --> 44:35.084
- I said...
- Turn around and go.

44:37.520 --> 44:40.091
Turn around and go.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.003
That's a nice little sword.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.367
Worth 100 pigeons, a sword like that.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.642
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

44:51.720 --> 44:54.451
Come on. Quickly, go! Go!

45:07.800 --> 45:09.211
Who are you?

45:09.840 --> 45:11.285
Why were they scared of you?

45:11.920 --> 45:13.490
You lost this.

45:24.760 --> 45:26.649
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

45:27.160 --> 45:28.491
There isn't.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.801
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

45:33.200 --> 45:35.009
Well, who are you, then?

45:36.120 --> 45:37.565
No one.

45:37.640 --> 45:40.484
And that is who a girl must become.

46:28.880 --> 46:30.928
She doesn't belong here.

46:31.280 --> 46:34.727
And no matter how many of you traitors
call her "Mhysa",

46:35.480 --> 46:37.289
she will never be your mother.

46:51.880 --> 46:53.211
Why?

46:54.880 --> 46:56.530
For you, Mhysa.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.767
You wanted the Harpy dead,

47:02.080 --> 47:04.082
but your hands were tied.

47:04.560 --> 47:07.245
I set you free, as you did all of us.

47:07.400 --> 47:10.404
He was our prisoner, awaiting trial.

47:11.040 --> 47:12.246
You had no right.

47:12.320 --> 47:16.405
He would rather rip your city apart
than see slaves lifted from the dirt.

47:16.640 --> 47:19.120
There are no more slaves.

47:19.520 --> 47:21.761
There are no more Masters.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.082
Then who lives in the pyramids?

47:26.000 --> 47:28.765
Who wears gold masks
and murders your children?

47:32.640 --> 47:34.642
When Grey Worm came to us,

47:35.080 --> 47:37.401
I was the first to take up
the knife for you.

47:39.320 --> 47:42.164
I remember the look on my father's face
as I struck down his Master,

47:43.800 --> 47:46.371
who had traded his infant son for a dog.

47:48.920 --> 47:52.686
My father died in the fighting.

47:54.240 --> 47:57.926
If we allow the Sons of the Harpy
to return us to chains,

48:00.520 --> 48:02.727
he never lived.

48:05.680 --> 48:09.651
The Harpy's life was not yours to take.

48:11.240 --> 48:13.766
Once, the Masters were the law-

48:13.840 --> 48:15.251
And now you are the law.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.163
The law is the law.

48:22.280 --> 48:23.611
Take him.

48:33.520 --> 48:36.649
Mhysa! Mhysa!

48:36.720 --> 48:39.530
Mhysa! Mhysa!

48:57.520 --> 49:00.205
Mhysa! Mhysa!

49:00.480 --> 49:03.006
Mhysa!

49:03.360 --> 49:06.728
She should have cut off the traitor's head
in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.

49:06.800 --> 49:08.928
Which is what I keep
telling her to do to you.

49:11.640 --> 49:15.201
Mhysa! Mhysa!

49:16.400 --> 49:18.368
You opened your gates to me

49:19.480 --> 49:23.087
because I promised you freedom and justice.

49:26.320 --> 49:30.484
One cannot exist without the other.

49:44.160 --> 49:48.563
Brother! Brother!

49:53.680 --> 49:56.889
Mhysa, please!

49:57.280 --> 49:58.566
Forgive me.

50:02.240 --> 50:07.246
A citizen of Meereen was awaiting
trial and this man murdered him.

50:07.480 --> 50:10.245
The punishment is death.

50:10.960 --> 50:17.047
Mercy, mercy

50:33.800 --> 50:34.801
Mhysa.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.047
Mhysa!

52:15.920 --> 52:18.366
I'll stand guard outside your door tonight,
Your Grace.

52:18.560 --> 52:20.050
We all guard tonight.

52:21.680 --> 52:22.727
Leave me.

53:15.920 --> 53:17.649
Drogon.
