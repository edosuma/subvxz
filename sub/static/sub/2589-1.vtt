00:28.389 --> 00:31.289
Hadassah?
Hadassah?

00:32.009 --> 00:34.410
Come at once, my love.
Quickly.

00:36.310 --> 00:37.560
Yes, uncle?

00:38.986 --> 00:40.935
I had a very strange dream...

00:41.800 --> 00:43.599
...and I want you to hear it.

00:45.312 --> 00:50.147
Behold, there were
earthquakes upon the earth,

00:50.250 --> 00:55.153
and in time,
two great dragons came forth,

00:55.255 --> 00:58.349
ready to fight
against one another.

00:58.458 --> 01:02.292
And at their cry,
all nations were stirred up

01:02.395 --> 01:06.058
to fight against
the Nation of the Just,

01:06.166 --> 01:10.500
and the Nation of the Just
was prepared for death.

01:10.603 --> 01:14.630
But the Nation of the Just
cried out to the Lord,

01:14.741 --> 01:16.800
and as they were crying,

01:16.910 --> 01:20.937
the little spring
grew into a great river,

01:21.047 --> 01:24.278
and abounded
into many waters.

01:24.384 --> 01:28.343
The sun rose up
and the humble were exalted,

01:28.455 --> 01:30.923
and they defeated
the haughty.

01:31.024 --> 01:34.585
And that was the
end of the dream.

01:34.694 --> 01:38.221
How can a little spring
turn into a great river?

01:38.331 --> 01:40.231
Have faith, my love.

01:40.333 --> 01:45.202
The Lord, in his infinite mercy,
will reveal its meaning.

01:45.305 --> 01:49.298
Until then, you must promise
never to reveal to anyone

01:49.409 --> 01:52.640
that you are a Jew
from the Tribe of Benjamin.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.145
Never, Uncle?

01:54.247 --> 02:01.119
As God lives, there will
be a time for you to remain silent

02:01.221 --> 02:04.190
and a time for you to speak.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.918
You shall no longer
be called Hadassah;

02:07.027 --> 02:10.793
you shall be called Esther,

02:10.896 --> 02:14.890
a proper Persian name
for a proper Persian girl.

02:15.001 --> 02:16.400
But Uncle...

02:16.503 --> 02:19.836
And you must never
again call me Uncle.

02:19.939 --> 02:24.000
From now on,
you shall call me Teacher,

02:24.110 --> 02:27.170
for that is what I am.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.714
Do you understand,
Esther?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.306
Yes, Teacher.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.943
You must be careful,

02:34.054 --> 02:38.423
for God has given me
this dream for a reason.

02:38.525 --> 02:40.789
Come to me, my love.

02:40.894 --> 02:44.261
Sing to me, my sweet,
sing to me.

03:13.259 --> 03:16.023
All hail, King Xerxes!

03:22.702 --> 03:24.533
Hail, King Xerxes!

03:43.490 --> 03:47.187
Esther,
Esther, come quickly!

03:47.260 --> 03:48.852
Esther!

03:54.334 --> 03:56.598
As royal
as the king himself.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.637
I fear it fits me
not at all.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.969
I am only a modest man.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.975
Well, you're going
to the royal banquet,

04:04.077 --> 04:08.776
and you must honor
the king and his queen.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.873
Howl envy her.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.077
You wish to be queen?

04:13.186 --> 04:15.518
No, I wish to be married.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.249
Esther, my love,

04:17.357 --> 04:20.019
you will marry when
I find a suitable match.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.524
Have I no say
in the matter?

04:21.628 --> 04:25.120
The Lord God
requires of us obedience.

04:25.231 --> 04:27.563
It is he that made us,
not we who have made him.

04:30.803 --> 04:35.433
The Lord will reveal
his will soon enough,

04:35.542 --> 04:38.238
I promise.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.605
A splendid Royal Banquet,

05:15.715 --> 05:19.116
thoroughly cheapened by the
presence of that Jew, Mordecai.

05:19.219 --> 05:22.450
A bit harsh,
don't you think, Lord Haman?

05:22.555 --> 05:25.183
It's not in my nature
to mince words.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.593
Lord Haman.

05:28.695 --> 05:31.562
Mordecai.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.461
I was not expecting
to see you here.

05:33.566 --> 05:34.965
Likewise.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.467
I was lead to believe

05:36.569 --> 05:39.367
that only the king's closest
advisors would be invited.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.871
As was I,

05:40.974 --> 05:44.375
but apparently the Majesty
decided to invite you as well.

05:44.477 --> 05:47.503
The king is a most
benevolent man.

05:47.614 --> 05:52.415
Yes, most benevolent,
I fear.

05:52.518 --> 05:56.750
If I had it in my power,
I'd crush you under my heel,

05:56.856 --> 06:00.223
you and your
insidious people.

06:00.326 --> 06:04.626
As my God lives,
that day will never come.

06:12.672 --> 06:15.835
All hail, King Xerxes!

06:15.942 --> 06:17.876
Hail, King Xerxes!

06:17.977 --> 06:20.468
Nobles, advisors,
and all royal servants,

06:20.580 --> 06:24.880
I extend to you
my warmest welcome.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.456
I'm indeed pleased
to celebrate with you

06:31.557 --> 06:35.084
the anniversary of my
ascension to the throne.

06:41.401 --> 06:45.701
Queen Vashti, too,
extends her warmest welcome.

06:50.209 --> 06:51.938
And where is
our Queen Vashti?

06:52.045 --> 06:54.411
Does she not find our
celebration rich enough?

06:54.514 --> 06:56.141
Perhaps she is unwell.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.774
Please avail
yourselves of the food and wine,

06:58.885 --> 07:01.877
eat and drink without limit,

07:01.988 --> 07:04.218
for it gives me
great pleasure

07:04.324 --> 07:07.316
to share this
celebration with you.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.327
Let the feasting begin!

07:09.429 --> 07:11.488
All hail, King Xerxes!

07:11.597 --> 07:13.792
Hail, King Xerxes!

07:32.485 --> 07:35.613
Keep open your ears,

07:35.722 --> 07:40.455
I wish to know exactly what my
nobles and advisors are saying.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.790
By your word, Majesty.

07:57.343 --> 07:59.811
Mordecai's not
slept well lately.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.643
He speaks of rumors
and threats against the king.

08:03.750 --> 08:06.913
These palace intrigues
are not our concern.

08:07.019 --> 08:09.044
You should think
of pleasant things.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.247
Like marriage?

08:14.026 --> 08:18.588
Don't you agree that a woman
my age should be married by now?.

08:18.698 --> 08:20.689
You ask a difficult question.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.236
A woman should marry as soon as
a suitable match can be found.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.363
Suitable match? Suppose
there is no suitable match?

08:27.473 --> 08:30.874
Well, none of them are
suitable matches, I should know.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.376
But you married Jacob.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.538
Aye, that I did.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.582
Were the two of you
not in love?

08:37.683 --> 08:39.082
If it was love
Jacob was after,

08:39.184 --> 08:44.212
he would have married his donkey
and probably been happier.

08:44.323 --> 08:46.223
And what about you?

08:46.325 --> 08:49.021
If given the choice, I would
have married Jacob's donkey.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.095
Judith!

08:51.697 --> 08:54.427
In truth,
Jacob was a good match.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.434
He's a hard worker
when he works

08:56.536 --> 08:59.733
and a good provider
when he provides.

08:59.839 --> 09:02.865
Do you love him?

09:02.975 --> 09:04.772
Between children,
and grandchildren,

09:04.877 --> 09:07.368
and all the things a woman
has to take care of these days,

09:07.480 --> 09:11.610
who has time
to think about love?

09:26.833 --> 09:29.563
Queen Vashti is a mystery.

09:29.669 --> 09:35.767
Ever since the royal wedding,
she is seen so rarely.

09:35.875 --> 09:40.073
Pity, she's more
beautiful than any flower.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.909
Yes, Azada,
but flowers fade.

09:43.015 --> 09:46.075
She likewise is more
beautiful than any sunset.

09:46.185 --> 09:50.918
But the sunset eventually
turns to darkness, does it not?

09:51.023 --> 09:53.548
Then again,
His Majesty believes her to be

09:53.659 --> 09:56.651
more beautiful
than any jewel.

09:56.762 --> 10:00.528
But jewels can be
lost or stolen.

10:00.633 --> 10:01.361
Mordecai?

10:02.969 --> 10:05.164
All that you say is true,

10:05.271 --> 10:09.640
yet does not Vashti
remain our queen?

10:09.742 --> 10:13.234
Then she should appear
before us and receive our honor.

10:13.346 --> 10:17.715
As it is written, like a
gold ring in a pig's snout,

10:17.817 --> 10:22.345
is a beautiful woman
without discretion?

10:22.455 --> 10:26.653
Yes, come.

10:36.502 --> 10:39.733
What think you
of our Queen Vashti?

10:39.839 --> 10:41.238
The king has called her

10:41.340 --> 10:42.864
the most beautiful
woman in the world.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.738
Then why does
she not appear?

10:44.844 --> 10:48.041
Is our queen suddenly
found unsuitable?

10:48.147 --> 10:51.708
If the king chose her,
then she is suitable.

10:51.817 --> 10:56.777
Even kings have been known
to make mistakes.

11:04.864 --> 11:08.322
Toast to the king!

11:19.178 --> 11:22.238
What news?

11:22.348 --> 11:24.509
Your Majesty's
nobles and advisors

11:24.617 --> 11:30.385
are anxious
to see the queen.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.299
My good people,

11:40.399 --> 11:42.094
as much as I have
endeavored to provide you

11:42.201 --> 11:44.192
with the finest
in food and wine,

11:44.303 --> 11:47.101
I regret that
I have withheld from you

11:47.206 --> 11:52.838
the greatest of all blessings,
Queen Vashti.

11:52.945 --> 11:56.711
I shall therefore
deny you no longer.

11:56.816 --> 12:01.048
And not a moment
too soon.

12:01.153 --> 12:05.487
Sardar, I command
that the Queen Vashti join us here

12:05.591 --> 12:09.425
in the royal hall
and dance for us.

12:09.528 --> 12:14.693
It will please me greatly to
have her join me by my side.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.564
By your word, Majesty.

12:29.849 --> 12:33.649
Permission to enter?

12:37.223 --> 12:39.691
Permission to enter, Royal One.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.259
Granted.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.733
My queen,
the women wish to know

12:50.836 --> 12:54.932
whether you prefer diamonds
or pearls on your headdress.

12:55.041 --> 12:58.943
Cannot my husband, the king,
afford both diamonds and pearls?

12:59.045 --> 13:00.478
Yes, that is so,
Royal One.

13:00.579 --> 13:01.978
Then I shall have both.

13:02.081 --> 13:03.480
Yes, Royal One.

13:03.582 --> 13:06.813
It's the least that
foolish man can do for me.

13:11.290 --> 13:17.229
Royal One, I caution you to
choose your words carefully.

13:17.329 --> 13:20.628
And I caution you not
to be so presumptuous.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.758
Yes, Royal One.

13:22.868 --> 13:26.031
The king is a fool,
but he is also in love,

13:26.138 --> 13:29.130
which means I shall
have the upper hand.

13:29.241 --> 13:33.007
Did I not vow to be a queen
unlike any Persia has ever seen?

13:33.112 --> 13:37.549
Yes, my queen, and you have
kept that vow most faithfully.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.884
Who's there?

13:40.986 --> 13:44.387
Sardar, the commander
of His Majesty's royal army.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.155
I honor you, Queen Vashti.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.323
What is the meaning
of this intrusion?

13:54.433 --> 13:56.731
The king has commanded
your presence at once.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.599
You are to wear
your finest garments

13:58.704 --> 14:01.104
and place a jeweled tiara
upon your head.

14:01.207 --> 14:04.267
In such fashion shall you
dance for His Majesty

14:04.376 --> 14:06.435
and for his guests.

14:08.147 --> 14:09.842
Is that what the king asks?

14:09.949 --> 14:14.852
No, Royal One,
it is what the king commands.

14:14.954 --> 14:17.013
Tell him I'm busy.

14:17.123 --> 14:23.255
Royal One, I'm
afraid you misunderstand.

14:23.362 --> 14:28.493
The king has commanded you
to come before him and dance.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.627
Suppose I'm not
in the mood for dancing?

14:31.737 --> 14:34.228
The king is also a warrior.

14:34.340 --> 14:38.276
When he commands his soldiers,
they must obey.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.368
Very well,

14:40.479 --> 14:44.415
have him command his army
to dance for him.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.984
Royal One!

14:59.298 --> 15:01.596
If I return to the king
without you,

15:01.700 --> 15:03.861
my life may be in peril.

15:03.969 --> 15:05.664
For the sake of my head,

15:05.771 --> 15:09.332
I ask that you do
as the king commands.

15:09.441 --> 15:12.604
I care not for your head
nor for anyone else's.

15:12.711 --> 15:14.110
I have made up my mind.

15:14.213 --> 15:16.909
And even if His Majesty himself
came to fetch me,

15:17.016 --> 15:19.075
I would not go.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.745
Now leave me!

15:21.854 --> 15:24.982
I find this
conversation tiresome.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.690
The queen tarries.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.694
Perhaps she needs more time
to make herself presentable.

16:03.796 --> 16:08.256
Perhaps she is deliberately
trying to keep us in suspense.

16:11.537 --> 16:13.801
We soon shall see.

16:13.906 --> 16:16.773
Sardar, what is
the meaning of this?

16:16.876 --> 16:19.310
Who dares disobey the king?

16:19.411 --> 16:21.174
The queen, Your Majesty.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.770
What did she say?

16:22.882 --> 16:26.579
Out with it!

16:27.887 --> 16:30.720
She said she was not
in the mood for dancing.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.554
If this is treason
you speak against the queen...

16:34.660 --> 16:38.096
It is not treason,
Your Majesty, but truth.

16:38.197 --> 16:41.758
Perhaps the queen
misunderstood my command.

16:41.867 --> 16:43.596
No, Majesty.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.863
The queen
understood perfectly.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.370
She said that
even if Your Majesty

16:47.473 --> 16:49.805
came to fetch her yourself,

16:49.909 --> 16:51.877
she would not go.

16:54.914 --> 16:59.283
This
impertinence shall not stand.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.012
If I allow Queen Vashti
to disobey me,

17:01.120 --> 17:04.920
then what will stop the women
of Persia from doing likewise?

17:05.023 --> 17:08.050
I shall therefore
issue a new command.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.820
By your word, Majesty.

17:09.929 --> 17:13.296
I command that Queen Vashti

17:13.398 --> 17:16.596
be removed from
the palace at once,

17:16.702 --> 17:22.766
and I decree that
my marriage to her

17:22.875 --> 17:26.310
is null and void.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.311
By your word, Majesty.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.814
All hail, King Xerxes!

17:30.916 --> 17:32.884
Hail, King Xerxes!

17:34.186 --> 17:37.553
I wish to be alone.

17:46.765 --> 17:49.495
Esther, Esther,
I have terrible news!

17:49.601 --> 17:51.000
What is it?

17:51.103 --> 17:53.867
The king has dissolved
his marriage to Queen Vashti.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.737
It is said that she
wickedly disobeyed a command.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.367
What exactly did the king
command her to do?

17:59.478 --> 18:01.002
She was commanded

18:01.113 --> 18:04.276
to dance for the king
and his guests, and she refused.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.248
And for this reason
she was banished?

18:06.352 --> 18:08.411
Well, a royal command is
not to be taken lightly,

18:08.520 --> 18:11.614
nor should a woman
disobey her husband.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.954
Oh Judith,
you're one to talk.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.959
Would you have me believe
that there is no disobedience

18:16.061 --> 18:17.460
in your marriage?

18:17.563 --> 18:18.962
None whatsoever.

18:19.064 --> 18:22.056
Jacob does exactly
what I tell him to do.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.167
Perhaps it is best
that I'm not married.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.399
It is a
complicated business.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.772
But not without
its rewards.

18:31.877 --> 18:33.276
Judith,
stop your gossiping.

18:33.379 --> 18:36.371
These palace intrigues
are none of our concern.

18:36.482 --> 18:40.213
Oh, Miriam, Miriam!
I have terrible news!

18:42.554 --> 18:45.079
This is a disaster
for the kingdom.

18:45.190 --> 18:49.286
A fatalist sees a disaster;
a wise man sees opportunity.

18:49.395 --> 18:52.421
But Lord Haman,
Persia is without a queen!

18:52.531 --> 18:54.761
Then His Majesty will simply
have to find a new one!

18:54.867 --> 18:57.665
Yes, Lord Haman, but
from which part of the world?

18:57.770 --> 19:01.137
All of our allies have
run out of eligible brides.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.606
Well, then His Majesty
will have to find a new queen

19:03.709 --> 19:05.574
amongst his own people,

19:05.677 --> 19:10.979
a young woman of nobility,
preferably...

19:11.083 --> 19:15.918
a daughter of one of
his closest advisors.

19:16.021 --> 19:17.488
Ah!

19:20.459 --> 19:26.091
What a pity it is that the gods
have favored you with ten sons

19:26.198 --> 19:27.597
and not a single daughter.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.098
But Gaspar,
have you forgotten

19:29.201 --> 19:31.897
that I have daughter
called Zara?

19:32.004 --> 19:36.304
Forgive me, Lord Haman,
but she is but a child.

19:36.408 --> 19:37.875
That was yesterday.

19:37.976 --> 19:39.739
You know children,
they grow up so quickly.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.779
Quickly enough for marriage?

19:41.880 --> 19:43.848
Indeed!

19:45.484 --> 19:48.180
You must take this proposal
to the king at once.

19:48.287 --> 19:51.188
No, no, no, I'm far too
modest to make such a proposal myself.

19:51.290 --> 19:55.158
No, no, that is why I'm relying
upon you to make it for me.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.057
Me? But...

19:57.162 --> 20:03.431
Oh, faithful friend, I want
the honor to be all yours.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.534
But, Lord Haman,

20:11.643 --> 20:17.104
what if His Majesty
receives it badly?

20:18.250 --> 20:20.445
I may lose my head.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.715
But I would be supremely
grateful for your sacrifice.

20:23.822 --> 20:29.852
Now, the king's counsel will
be meeting with the king soon.

20:29.962 --> 20:35.264
I want you to prepare
well your speech,

20:35.367 --> 20:41.169
for my sake,
as well as for yours.

20:47.579 --> 20:51.709
Blessed are you, Lord,
our God, King of the universe,

20:51.817 --> 20:54.615
who sanctifies us
with his commandments

20:54.720 --> 20:58.713
and commands us to light
the Sabbath candles.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.291
Amen.

21:02.327 --> 21:05.421
We should also give thanks
for our King Xerxes,

21:05.531 --> 21:08.625
for permitting our people to
celebrate the Sabbath in peace.

21:08.734 --> 21:12.067
If the king did not permit us
to celebrate the Sabbath,

21:12.171 --> 21:14.332
we would of course disobey,
would we not?

21:14.439 --> 21:16.737
Yes, my child,
that is true.

21:16.842 --> 21:22.007
It would be better to disobey
the king than to disobey God.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.550
And yet the queen disobeyed
the king and was banished.

21:25.651 --> 21:30.384
The queen was indeed banished
because of her disobedience.

21:30.489 --> 21:32.616
The queen was banished
because she refused to dance

21:32.724 --> 21:34.783
before the king
and make a spectacle of herself.

21:34.893 --> 21:35.655
Esther!

21:38.397 --> 21:41.298
I cannot find it
in myself to condemn her,

21:41.400 --> 21:45.359
for if I had been commanded so,
I too would have disobeyed.

21:45.470 --> 21:49.201
Esther, you are permitted
many things under my roof,

21:49.308 --> 21:52.607
but treason
is not one of them.

21:52.711 --> 21:57.011
If the king commands it,
you are not to question.

21:57.115 --> 21:58.776
Even if the king
commanded our people

21:58.884 --> 22:00.283
not to obey the Sabbath?

22:00.385 --> 22:01.784
Yes.

22:01.887 --> 22:04.981
I mean no, I...

22:05.090 --> 22:07.217
Either my words
are failing me,

22:07.326 --> 22:11.262
or the student has indeed
surpassed the teacher.

22:11.363 --> 22:15.663
Esther, my love, you must
follow your conscience,

22:15.767 --> 22:19.760
but obedience to God is the
sure path to righteousness.

22:19.871 --> 22:21.270
Yes, Teacher.

22:21.373 --> 22:23.864
Yes.

22:43.829 --> 22:45.797
Yes, Lord Haman.

22:50.969 --> 22:53.403
All hail, King Xerxes!

22:53.505 --> 22:55.803
Hail, King Xerxes!

23:06.685 --> 23:08.516
There must
be treachery afoot.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.713
How so, Mordecai?

23:10.822 --> 23:13.450
Haman's lips are moving.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.789
Providence has ordained
that my head bears the crown,

23:16.895 --> 23:19.455
but is it also the
design of providence

23:19.564 --> 23:22.931
that I should spend
my life in solitude?

23:23.035 --> 23:28.132
Is there no suitable queen
for the king of Persia?

23:29.608 --> 23:34.841
Your Majesty, if I may
have permission to speak?

23:41.453 --> 23:45.685
Oh great king, it is neither
the design of providence

23:45.791 --> 23:51.388
nor the will of your people that
Your Majesty remain unmarried.

23:51.997 --> 23:54.329
Where, then, would you
have me find a queen?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.628
Do you think we've
not looked everywhere?

23:56.735 --> 23:59.203
His Majesty has
looked everywhere

23:59.304 --> 24:04.003
except from among
his own people.

24:05.577 --> 24:08.375
This eunich
speaks truthfully.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.910
Is it not customary
for the king

24:11.049 --> 24:13.483
to marry the daughter
of one of his allies?

24:13.585 --> 24:20.514
Customary, Majesty,
but not required.

24:21.893 --> 24:24.828
Again, the
eunuch speaks truthfully.

24:24.930 --> 24:29.993
And Majesty,
if I may be so bold,

24:30.102 --> 24:32.536
may I...

24:32.637 --> 24:39.042
may I suggest you look toward
your nobles and advisors

24:39.144 --> 24:41.112
for such a queen?

24:44.716 --> 24:48.812
Gentlemen, what
think you of this proposal?

24:48.920 --> 24:55.655
Your Majesty,
if I may be permitted,

24:56.695 --> 25:01.723
Gaspar's suggestion,
while it is a worthy one,

25:01.833 --> 25:03.994
is not feasible, I fear.

25:04.102 --> 25:05.569
For what reason?

25:05.670 --> 25:07.069
Your Majesty surely knows

25:07.172 --> 25:10.335
that more than half of your
counselors are eunuchs.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.103
That's a great disadvantage,
I'm afraid,

25:12.210 --> 25:16.112
when it comes to
producing offspring.

25:17.616 --> 25:24.522
Your Majesty, my worthy
colleague is mistaken.

25:25.557 --> 25:27.616
One of your counselors
does indeed

25:27.726 --> 25:31.457
have a suitable
candidate for marriage.

25:31.563 --> 25:33.758
Pray tell me Gaspar.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.390
Who is this
suitable candidate?

25:36.501 --> 25:43.304
It is none other than
Zara, the daughter of Lord Haman.

25:43.408 --> 25:48.573
Lord Haman,
does Gaspar speak the truth?

25:51.550 --> 25:54.018
He does indeed,
Your Majesty,

25:54.119 --> 25:58.283
and while I love my daughter
more than my own life,

25:58.390 --> 26:04.329
it would give me great pleasure
to offer her to you as a bride.

26:04.429 --> 26:08.456
I also have another
candidate, Your Majesty.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.502
Mordecai, you
have never taken a wife.

26:11.603 --> 26:14.231
Whence comes this candidate?

26:14.339 --> 26:17.137
Your Majesty
speaks the truth,

26:17.242 --> 26:20.871
however it has been my
pleasure to be the guardian

26:20.979 --> 26:23.641
of a young orphan girl

26:23.748 --> 26:28.378
who has grown into an
exceptional young woman,

26:28.487 --> 26:31.923
as fine a daughter
as Persia can produce.

26:32.023 --> 26:35.925
Tell me, Mordecai,
is she beautiful?

26:36.027 --> 26:39.258
As lovely as a
morning star, Your Majesty,

26:39.364 --> 26:44.427
and more importantly,
she is as obedient and modest

26:44.536 --> 26:48.267
as she is beautiful.

26:48.373 --> 26:52.070
Permit me a
word, gracious Majesty.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.304
As you wish,
Lord Haman.

26:54.412 --> 26:59.440
The selection of a bride
is no small matter,

26:59.551 --> 27:01.382
but I would think
you would agree with me

27:01.486 --> 27:06.549
that only women of quality
should be selected.

27:06.658 --> 27:08.956
Did not Gaspar say
that my nobles and advisors

27:09.060 --> 27:12.359
could select a woman
of good standing?

27:12.464 --> 27:16.798
Why then do you disagree
with your own eunuch?

27:16.902 --> 27:21.896
Very well then,
are there any others?

27:24.910 --> 27:26.605
I have a candidate,
Your Majesty.

27:26.711 --> 27:29.111
I also have a candidate,
Your Majesty.

27:29.614 --> 27:32.708
As well do I, Majesty.

27:32.817 --> 27:36.844
I command that the daughters of
Persia be brought to the palace

27:36.955 --> 27:38.479
at the time of my choosing

27:38.590 --> 27:42.185
and presented to me
for my royal perusal.

27:42.294 --> 27:47.254
In such manner
shall I find a new queen.

27:48.066 --> 27:50.626
All hail, King Xerxes!

27:50.735 --> 27:53.636
Hail, King Xerxes!

28:04.950 --> 28:06.781
This is a disaster
for the kingdom.

28:06.885 --> 28:10.582
Oh, a fatalist sees a disaster;
a wise man sees an opportunity.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.123
Oh, silence,
you foolish eunuch.

28:13.224 --> 28:15.124
Didn't I tell you to
prepare well your speech?

28:15.226 --> 28:17.194
Lord Haman,
I had no idea Mordecai

28:17.295 --> 28:19.286
would suggest a contest.

28:19.397 --> 28:22.662
It's insolence,
the nerve of that hapless Jew.

28:22.767 --> 28:26.430
He proposes that a stray,

28:26.538 --> 28:29.029
a cast-off become queen.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.665
Mordecai said
she was an orphan.

28:31.776 --> 28:34.267
We know not the child's
true circumstances,

28:34.379 --> 28:36.939
nor are we likely
to find them out.

28:37.048 --> 28:41.007
Lord Haman, if she
was raised by Mordecai,

28:41.119 --> 28:44.145
she is clearly unsuitable.

28:44.255 --> 28:47.019
What further proof
do you require?

28:47.125 --> 28:50.390
Because Mordecai
is cunning, if nothing else.

28:50.495 --> 28:54.090
Who knows what trickery
this old Jew has up his sleeve?

28:54.199 --> 28:58.659
Lord Haman, I can confidently
predict that whatever candidates

28:58.770 --> 29:03.537
may appear, they will be
no match for your Zara.

29:03.642 --> 29:06.304
What, are you a prophet
suddenly as well as a fool?

29:06.411 --> 29:11.314
Rarely are those two qualities
captured in one man.

29:11.416 --> 29:16.353
Shh, shh.

29:18.189 --> 29:21.852
There we go, there we go.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.258
Keep your head,
Lord Haman.

29:26.831 --> 29:31.165
All will be well, shh.

29:31.269 --> 29:36.673
All better be well,

29:36.775 --> 29:40.336
because it will be
your head that is lost.

29:48.353 --> 29:49.820
Haman!

30:04.803 --> 30:06.361
Esther, my love.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.564
Oh, forgive me, Teacher.

30:08.673 --> 30:11.369
I must remember not to make
noise while you are studying.

30:11.476 --> 30:16.004
Esther, your singing is sweet
and it bothers me not.

30:16.114 --> 30:19.174
My love, did I not
promise that you would marry

30:19.284 --> 30:21.752
when I found
a suitable match?

30:21.853 --> 30:23.718
Teacher, has the Lord
revealed his will to you?

30:23.822 --> 30:24.379
Well...

30:33.865 --> 30:36.163
All my worrying was for naught,
for I know that the Lord

30:36.267 --> 30:38.861
has heard my prayers
and he has answered them.

30:38.970 --> 30:43.339
Tell me, Teacher, tell me.
Who is it that I'm to marry?

30:43.441 --> 30:47.673
It is the king.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.179
The king of what?

30:50.281 --> 30:54.149
Why, the king
of Persia of course.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.315
The same king
who banished the queen

30:57.422 --> 30:59.356
because she refused
to dance?

30:59.457 --> 31:01.391
Esther, my love, I know
this is a difficult thing.

31:01.493 --> 31:04.758
Difficult?
Might I suggest impossible?

31:04.863 --> 31:06.592
Why would the king
choose me as his queen?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.097
He knows me not.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.598
You speak the truth,
my love,

31:09.701 --> 31:12.499
but it is also true the king
may not take you for a queen.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.572
I thought you said
that a match had been made.

31:14.672 --> 31:18.574
Not quite.

31:18.676 --> 31:21.770
Am I to compete,
as in a race?

31:21.880 --> 31:24.678
Esther, the competition
is fierce,

31:24.783 --> 31:31.018
and if you lose it may mean
the death of our people.

31:32.023 --> 31:35.550
This is beyond
my understanding.

31:35.660 --> 31:39.926
My child, listen to me.

31:40.031 --> 31:43.057
Lord Haman, the wicked
man who hates our people

31:43.168 --> 31:46.535
has proposed his own
daughter as a match.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.731
If she becomes queen,

31:48.840 --> 31:51.434
Haman will be the power
behind the throne.

31:51.543 --> 31:57.880
Our king is still young
and requires sound advice.

31:57.982 --> 32:04.080
I worry that Haman's evil
will be unrestricted.

32:04.189 --> 32:06.180
You must pray, Esther.

32:06.291 --> 32:11.729
You must ask God for
wisdom and strength.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.390
I will need much
of both, I fear.

32:14.499 --> 32:16.865
Fear not,
they are richly blessed

32:16.968 --> 32:19.937
who put their
trust in God.

32:22.874 --> 32:28.141
I will pray, Teacher, for
both wisdom and for strength.

32:28.246 --> 32:30.578
Pray also for me.

32:30.682 --> 32:36.643
I have lit a fire that
will not be easily put out.

32:39.657 --> 32:43.388
Yes, Father Mordecai.

32:51.236 --> 32:52.703
I honor you, Lord Haman.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.203
Oh, honor me later.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.364
Fetch me my wife
and be quick about it.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.669
Begging
your pardon, Lord Haman.

32:58.776 --> 33:03.213
Your wife left word that
she is too busy to see you.

33:08.653 --> 33:12.453
Too busy?

33:12.557 --> 33:17.620
If my wife intends to follow
the example of the queen,

33:17.729 --> 33:19.959
tell her she can
obtain the same results,

33:20.064 --> 33:22.828
only I shall banish her
to the desert,

33:22.934 --> 33:24.834
and when the vultures
have had their fill,

33:24.936 --> 33:27.268
she'll make
a pretty fossil.

33:27.372 --> 33:30.603
Hush Husband, this foolish slave
has taken leave of his senses.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.505
Nasir, return to your chores!

33:32.610 --> 33:34.305
As you command,
Lady Haman.

33:34.545 --> 33:36.172
Oh my husband,
what good news from the palace?

33:36.381 --> 33:37.780
There is none.

33:37.882 --> 33:39.611
Has the king rejected
our daughter as his queen?

33:39.717 --> 33:41.116
He has not as yet.

33:41.219 --> 33:43.244
Then why did you
insist the news is bad.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.219
Because of that Jew,
Mordecai!

33:45.323 --> 33:48.190
Thanks to his treachery,
the betrothal is now a contest

33:48.293 --> 33:51.126
in which his own candidate is
a rival to our daughter, Zara.

33:51.229 --> 33:53.390
The impertinence
of that man.

33:53.498 --> 33:57.229
Now, we'll have to
depend on our daughter

33:57.335 --> 34:00.532
to win the affections of the
king with her charm and beauty.

34:00.638 --> 34:03.573
You realize, of course, that
puts us at a great disadvantage.

34:03.675 --> 34:06.143
Oh, have I not eyes,
woman?

34:08.513 --> 34:11.846
If only the
king were blind,

34:11.949 --> 34:14.976
then all our troubles
would soon be over.

34:15.085 --> 34:18.146
Our daughter's
not entirely unfair,

34:18.255 --> 34:19.688
and what of
Mordecai's candidate?

34:19.791 --> 34:20.553
Have you seen her?

34:22.159 --> 34:23.592
Then perhaps this
tension is for naught.

34:23.695 --> 34:26.094
Oh, unlikely,
Mordecai's too clever.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.994
Perhaps you
give him too much credit.

34:28.099 --> 34:31.762
All I know is that Zara
was not meant to have a rival.

34:31.869 --> 34:33.666
There, there,
my husband.

34:33.771 --> 34:35.931
Leave it to me.

34:36.040 --> 34:41.501
With some jewels and
cosmetics and fine fabrics,

34:41.612 --> 34:46.242
I shall fashion our Zara
into a worthy queen.

34:46.351 --> 34:48.181
That'll take
an act of the gods.

34:48.286 --> 34:49.514
Is your ambition lacking?

34:52.255 --> 34:55.623
I shall see the
house of Haman rule,

34:55.726 --> 34:59.026
then shall I have my revenge
on those insidious Jews

34:59.130 --> 35:05.535
whose king
exterminated my people.

35:05.636 --> 35:10.369
One task at a time,
my lord.

35:13.678 --> 35:16.272
Incline your ear,
O Lord, and hear me,

35:16.381 --> 35:20.784
for I am poor and needy.

35:20.885 --> 35:23.820
You are my God.

35:23.921 --> 35:29.359
Save your servant
who trusts in you.

35:29.460 --> 35:34.227
Oh God, what you ask
is a difficult thing,

35:34.332 --> 35:40.760
and yet I know that nothing
is impossible with you.

35:40.872 --> 35:45.434
If you will but call me by name,
I will answer and obey.

35:45.543 --> 35:48.808
Hadassah, Hadassah.

35:48.913 --> 35:51.279
Who's there?

35:51.382 --> 35:53.475
Hadassah.

35:53.584 --> 35:55.779
Who calls me by that name?

35:55.887 --> 35:58.651
It is I.

35:58.756 --> 36:01.884
Lord?

36:09.700 --> 36:14.399
Speak, Lord,
for I am listening.

36:14.505 --> 36:17.997
Because I am with you,
you shall not be harmed,

36:18.109 --> 36:23.308
for I am the Lord,
the Holy One of Israel.

36:23.414 --> 36:26.008
Yes, God.

36:26.117 --> 36:29.575
There will come for
you a time to keep silent,

36:29.687 --> 36:33.145
and a time for you to speak,

36:33.257 --> 36:39.924
for in all things
shall I be glorified.

36:40.031 --> 36:44.229
My God speaks
and I will obey.

36:56.314 --> 36:59.909
Oh, house of Haman,

37:00.017 --> 37:05.785
today shall you
receive your glory.

37:10.595 --> 37:12.563
Where is my wife?

37:14.465 --> 37:15.864
Is it success or failure?

37:15.967 --> 37:17.662
Patience, Husband.

37:17.768 --> 37:20.896
The house of Haman did not
become great in 1 day.

37:21.005 --> 37:23.098
No, but it
can be ruined in 1 day

37:23.207 --> 37:24.697
if my wife
and my daughter fail me.

37:24.809 --> 37:26.208
We shall not fail.

37:26.310 --> 37:27.777
Nasir.

37:30.014 --> 37:32.414
Have a look.

37:43.961 --> 37:46.862
It's a failure.

37:47.665 --> 37:53.035
Oh, why have the gods not
given me a worthy daughter?

37:53.137 --> 37:54.536
She is worthy.

37:54.639 --> 37:57.699
I didn't ask for a daughter
as handsome as myself.

37:57.808 --> 38:02.507
If she had but a fraction of
our beauty, all would be well.

38:02.613 --> 38:06.572
Hush, Husband,
you upset the girl.

38:06.684 --> 38:08.515
I will add a veil.

38:08.619 --> 38:12.282
It will add an air of mystery
for the king.

38:12.390 --> 38:15.757
Nasir,
fetch me my fabrics.

38:17.228 --> 38:20.789
If His Majesty is enchanted
by a bolt of cloth,

38:20.898 --> 38:23.833
then he's a greater fool
than he's been given credit for.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.233
Hush, Husband.

38:26.337 --> 38:29.067
We shall not fail;
all will be well.

38:29.173 --> 38:31.141
All better be well!

38:32.076 --> 38:34.203
I tell you this day

38:34.312 --> 38:36.803
that either my daughter Zara
will be crowned

38:36.914 --> 38:39.314
the queen of Persia

38:39.417 --> 38:43.877
or I will have
no daughter at all.

38:59.604 --> 39:04.541
I may be poorly dressed,
but I am rich in faith.

39:04.642 --> 39:08.271
My child, the palace will
provide you with all the oils

39:08.379 --> 39:10.609
and perfumes
and cosmetics you require.

39:10.715 --> 39:13.878
As much as she
desires and more.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.680
I have everything I need.

39:15.786 --> 39:18.016
If she captures
the king's heart,

39:18.122 --> 39:20.886
his eyes
will not disagree.

39:20.992 --> 39:24.758
Forgive me, I have not
cried so since my wedding day.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.057
Were they not
tears of joy?

39:27.164 --> 39:28.631
Not precisely.

39:29.634 --> 39:31.465
We go to the palace.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.196
And may our God
go with you.

39:33.304 --> 39:36.432
And be with your spirit,
Judith.

40:58.656 --> 41:01.216
Lord Haman's
daughter, the lady Zara,

41:01.325 --> 41:04.817
is a woman
of great modesty, my king.

41:04.929 --> 41:06.920
She wouldn't dream
of appearing before you

41:07.031 --> 41:09.659
with her face uncovered.

41:09.767 --> 41:12.327
An admirable quality,
I suppose.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.874
Can it be?

41:25.983 --> 41:27.450
Your Majesty?

41:27.518 --> 41:32.285
You there, step forward.

41:38.729 --> 41:41.527
By what name
are you called?

41:41.632 --> 41:44.430
My name is Esther,
Your Majesty.

41:44.535 --> 41:47.003
And who speaks for
this woman, Esther?

41:47.104 --> 41:49.766
I do, Your Majesty.

41:49.874 --> 41:51.307
And what say you
on her behalf?

41:51.409 --> 41:53.877
I can only quote
the writings of my people,

41:53.978 --> 41:58.915
that a virtuous wife
is more precious than rubies.

42:02.953 --> 42:07.788
Your Majesty, my daughter Zara
comes from a noble house

42:07.892 --> 42:11.123
whose lineage goes
back many generations.

42:11.228 --> 42:13.059
She will make
a charming wife

42:13.164 --> 42:17.260
as befits such a
fine and noble king.

42:17.368 --> 42:20.804
It is also written
that charm is deceptive,

42:20.905 --> 42:26.002
but a woman who fears God
will be greatly praised.

42:26.110 --> 42:28.169
Majesty, these
superstitious ramblings

42:28.279 --> 42:30.645
of this Jewish malcontent

42:30.748 --> 42:33.273
should have no impact
on your decision.

42:33.384 --> 42:36.717
Lord Haman, has
it not always been my pleasure

42:36.821 --> 42:38.584
to consider all advice?

42:38.689 --> 42:42.989
Indeed, Majesty, indeed.

42:43.761 --> 42:45.922
Sardar...

42:46.030 --> 42:50.364
Escort these two great daughters
of Persia to my chamber.

42:50.468 --> 42:52.595
I will summon them
at my pleasure.

42:52.703 --> 42:55.934
By your word, Majesty.

43:17.628 --> 43:18.526
All is prepared?

43:24.435 --> 43:26.596
Would not Your Majesty
be better served

43:26.704 --> 43:30.196
by speaking with
each woman directly?

43:30.307 --> 43:31.831
I shall learn
more from this

43:31.942 --> 43:34.809
than I could learn from
a thousand private talks,

43:34.912 --> 43:38.006
for to my face they will
tell me what I wish to hear,

43:38.115 --> 43:44.543
but in secret shall I divine
the true nature of these women.

43:44.655 --> 43:46.885
Yes, my lord.

43:55.833 --> 43:59.394
My lady, is this your
first time to the palace?

43:59.503 --> 44:01.471
Yes, yours as well?

44:04.174 --> 44:05.801
And what
think you of it?

44:05.910 --> 44:09.107
The palace?

44:09.213 --> 44:13.172
It's very...

44:13.284 --> 44:14.751
palatial.

44:15.853 --> 44:18.720
Yes, yes it is.

44:20.958 --> 44:26.828
My lady, I suspect
you're a woman of great beauty.

44:26.931 --> 44:30.924
Why then do you conceal
yourself with silk cloths?

44:31.035 --> 44:34.266
Alas, I am not
a woman of great beauty.

44:34.371 --> 44:36.339
This I cannot believe.

44:36.440 --> 44:39.671
It is my wicked parents
who have hidden my face.

44:39.777 --> 44:41.802
They are hoping that the
king confuses my disguise

44:41.912 --> 44:46.611
for modesty,
for if he sees my face,

44:46.717 --> 44:48.275
he will be repulsed.

44:48.385 --> 44:53.118
This cannot be.

44:53.223 --> 44:57.683
May I be allowed to
determine this for myself?

45:05.035 --> 45:06.593
You are beautiful!

45:10.307 --> 45:11.706
You mock me.

45:11.809 --> 45:13.538
I do not!

45:13.644 --> 45:16.169
Surely, anyone with eyes
can see you are as lovely

45:16.280 --> 45:19.943
as any daughter of Persia.

45:20.050 --> 45:23.281
You are the first person
to pay me this compliment;

45:23.387 --> 45:26.618
forgive me if
I am suspicious.

45:26.724 --> 45:30.216
Can you not
see for yourself?

45:30.327 --> 45:34.696
I only know that I'm a
disappointment to my family.

45:34.798 --> 45:40.532
Your own parents do not know
what a treasure they possess?

45:40.638 --> 45:42.037
If I'm indeed a treasure,

45:42.139 --> 45:44.767
it is one they are so
desperate to give away.

45:44.875 --> 45:46.570
But surely it is
because they wish to have

45:46.677 --> 45:48.269
a queen as a daughter.

45:48.379 --> 45:52.076
It is because my father
wishes to control the king.

45:52.182 --> 45:55.242
I am only
a means to an end.

45:55.352 --> 45:56.751
Forgive me for asking,

45:56.854 --> 46:02.815
but suppose the king
does not choose you?

46:05.329 --> 46:08.492
Then I shall pay dearly.

46:08.599 --> 46:13.161
I shall be banished
and live on the streets.

46:13.270 --> 46:16.637
No, if the king
does not choose you,

46:16.740 --> 46:18.537
you shall not
live on the streets.

46:18.642 --> 46:21.042
You will live
with me in the palace.

46:21.145 --> 46:22.544
As your slave?

46:22.646 --> 46:25.740
As my lady in waiting,
and if there be a more exalted

46:25.849 --> 46:32.118
position, it shall be yours,
you have my word.

46:38.128 --> 46:41.325
Summon Mordecai and Haman,

46:41.432 --> 46:43.366
I have made my choice.

46:43.467 --> 46:45.697
By your word, Majesty.

46:50.507 --> 46:55.968
My good men, what a
pleasant task I have completed this day.

46:56.180 --> 46:59.980
To select a wife from
Persia's finest daughters

47:00.084 --> 47:02.985
has been most agreeable to me.

47:03.087 --> 47:09.686
Though I have chosen quickly, I
am certain I have chosen wisely.

47:19.536 --> 47:22.562
Without further ado,

47:22.673 --> 47:27.576
it is Esther whom
I have chosen to be my queen.

47:28.312 --> 47:35.275
But Your Majesty, a king that
judges quickly judges unwisely.

47:36.120 --> 47:41.786
My eyes have seen
and my heart bares witness.

47:41.892 --> 47:44.952
This is indeed my queen.

47:45.062 --> 47:48.156
It can only
be the work of our God.

47:50.768 --> 47:53.965
I honor you, my lady,
and I only ask that you commit

47:54.071 --> 47:57.973
to your promise that I shall
be your faithful servant.

47:58.075 --> 48:00.737
Consider it done.

48:16.660 --> 48:21.120
I shall therefore
issue a royal proclamation.

48:21.231 --> 48:22.926
By your word,
Great Majesty.

48:23.033 --> 48:28.733
Let the word go forth
that Esther is my queen.

48:28.839 --> 48:32.935
Prepare a feast
and declare a holiday!

48:33.043 --> 48:35.511
Yes, King Xerxes.

48:53.530 --> 48:54.462
I honor you.

48:56.733 --> 48:59.327
Even the gods themselves
are against me.

48:59.436 --> 49:02.803
And why is my husband
roaring about like a lion?

49:02.906 --> 49:06.205
The house of Haman
lies in ruins because of you.

49:06.310 --> 49:08.778
Because of me?

49:08.879 --> 49:13.942
It would be an amazing trick
if I were able ponder it.

49:14.051 --> 49:15.848
Your magic is worthless.

49:15.953 --> 49:18.319
Hush, Husband.
Tell me about our daughter.

49:18.422 --> 49:20.014
We have no daughter.

49:20.123 --> 49:22.114
This is strange news,
Husband.

49:22.292 --> 49:25.261
I suspect the king
has chosen another.

49:25.362 --> 49:27.694
What, you're mocking me
to my face?

49:27.798 --> 49:33.737
Husband, in love as in war,
to the victor go the spoils.

49:33.837 --> 49:36.328
Then I tell you,
this is war.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.408
With the king?

49:39.409 --> 49:41.377
With Mordecai.

49:42.446 --> 49:44.880
Hear me, woman.

49:44.982 --> 49:49.282
The house of Haman
shall be redeemed.

50:23.553 --> 50:25.521
Do not fear, Esther.

50:29.993 --> 50:33.520
Thou may come closer.

50:39.469 --> 50:40.936
Closer.

50:45.242 --> 50:47.369
Are you indeed afraid?

50:47.477 --> 50:53.848
No, great king, I'm in awe
of your majesty and of your wisdom.

50:54.584 --> 50:56.609
How so?

50:56.720 --> 50:58.119
You have chosen
me for a bride

50:58.221 --> 51:00.689
without having spoken
a single word to me.

51:00.791 --> 51:05.524
Then come, sit
at my feet and let us talk.

51:05.629 --> 51:10.362
As you wish,
Your Majesty.

51:15.339 --> 51:18.069
Are you comfortable?

51:18.175 --> 51:21.235
I must answer Your Majesty's
question with another question.

51:21.345 --> 51:25.111
Ask.

51:25.215 --> 51:30.983
Is this always to be my
position, at His Majesty's feet?

51:31.088 --> 51:32.487
You are not
of noble birth,

51:32.589 --> 51:35.888
and therefore you must
take an inferior position.

51:35.993 --> 51:37.426
His Majesty speaks the truth,

51:37.527 --> 51:41.122
but in marriage shall
we not be equally yoked?

51:41.231 --> 51:42.960
My lady...

51:43.066 --> 51:48.732
I cannot raise you above the
circumstances of your birth.

51:48.839 --> 51:51.774
If you are indeed
to be my husband,

51:51.875 --> 51:55.902
then there is only one
solution to this problem.

52:05.555 --> 52:09.082
This is the solution
you had in mind?

52:09.192 --> 52:10.853
The very one, my king.

52:10.961 --> 52:13.623
You are much more beautiful
from this perspective.

52:13.730 --> 52:16.096
And His Majesty's face
is much more dignified

52:16.199 --> 52:19.657
than His Majesty's feet.

52:23.407 --> 52:25.773
Will you be an
obedient queen?

52:25.876 --> 52:27.969
That is all I ask.

52:28.078 --> 52:30.239
Will you be a
faithful husband?

52:30.347 --> 52:31.746
That is all I ask.

52:31.848 --> 52:37.150
My love for you is as great
as my love for Persia.

52:37.254 --> 52:41.088
And I shall obey you
as I would obey my God.

52:41.191 --> 52:45.127
My queen exalts me.

52:45.228 --> 52:47.788
It was Mordecai
who taught me thus.

52:47.898 --> 52:50.765
You have learned well.

52:50.867 --> 52:55.463
I wish our
wedding was tonight.

52:55.572 --> 52:57.403
Patience, my king.

52:57.507 --> 52:59.372
We have only
just engaged.

52:59.476 --> 53:03.708
Is not the king entitled
to get what he desires?

53:03.814 --> 53:06.977
The king desires
virtue above all else,

53:07.084 --> 53:10.281
and shall therefore be content
to wait for his bride.

53:10.387 --> 53:16.257
I will wait, but it will
bring me no happiness.

53:16.359 --> 53:17.758
Happier still will you be

53:17.861 --> 53:20.796
when the day of our
marriage finally arrives.

53:20.897 --> 53:26.392
Indeed, my love,
my Esther.

53:31.975 --> 53:36.412
Now you must go, before
immodesty takes hold of me.

53:36.513 --> 53:40.381
I fear no such thing,
for you are a king.

53:40.484 --> 53:42.645
But I am also a man.

53:42.752 --> 53:44.219
Now go.

53:47.324 --> 53:51.090
As my king commands,
I shall obey.

53:51.194 --> 53:53.492
Good night, sweet king.

53:53.597 --> 53:56.828
Good night, dear Esther.

54:11.548 --> 54:13.846
Walk with me.

54:13.950 --> 54:17.477
This night hurts time.

54:17.587 --> 54:23.184
Yes, my lord, but it
is the dawn that heals.

54:23.293 --> 54:24.954
The time has come
for us to act.

54:25.061 --> 54:26.460
Agreed.

54:26.563 --> 54:29.862
We've delayed long enough
while our foolish king

54:29.966 --> 54:32.457
follows his heart
and not his head.

54:32.569 --> 54:35.595
And Persia grows soft
as the consequence.

54:35.705 --> 54:38.003
Indeed.

54:38.108 --> 54:41.236
I tell you, Teres,
when I seize the crown,

54:41.344 --> 54:43.938
Persia will again be great.

54:44.047 --> 54:46.481
The army stands
behind you, my lord.

54:46.583 --> 54:49.313
It appears.

54:49.419 --> 54:51.944
Their patience
shall be rewarded,

54:52.055 --> 54:55.582
for soon they will dip
their spears in blood.

54:55.692 --> 54:57.523
We strike at midnight.

54:57.627 --> 54:59.060
I honor you, my lord.

54:59.162 --> 55:01.596
Prepare the men.

55:20.450 --> 55:24.045
Lord Haman,
why trouble me at this hour?

55:24.154 --> 55:29.786
Gracious Majesty,
I have a thorn in my side.

55:29.893 --> 55:33.454
Shall I help you remove it
along with your head?

55:33.563 --> 55:36.430
Gracious Majesty,
have I not been a loyal servant?

55:36.533 --> 55:41.197
Your fidelity is
unquestionable, Haman.

55:41.304 --> 55:45.070
Since you have chosen Mordecai's
candidate as your queen,

55:45.175 --> 55:48.406
it occurs to me that I'm less
esteemed as a result.

55:48.511 --> 55:52.242
Your worthiness
is not diminished in my eyes.

55:52.349 --> 55:54.715
Yes, maybe not
in His Majesty's eyes,

55:54.818 --> 55:58.754
but in the eyes
of my peers.

55:58.855 --> 56:00.948
What would
you have me do?

56:01.057 --> 56:05.357
Your Majesty, if it not
be too great a request,

56:05.462 --> 56:08.260
it would please me well
if you could make me

56:08.365 --> 56:11.391
the king's prime minister.

56:11.501 --> 56:13.662
Prime minister?

56:13.770 --> 56:16.068
It is simply another
title, Lord Haman.

56:16.172 --> 56:19.437
Yes, but one that
would require your people

56:19.542 --> 56:22.409
to bow before me.

56:22.512 --> 56:24.503
Very well, Lord Haman.

56:26.116 --> 56:27.549
Is there no peace
for the king?

56:27.617 --> 56:29.050
Who calls?!

56:29.119 --> 56:31.781
Mordecai, Your Majesty.

56:31.855 --> 56:35.848
Mordecai,
my friend, enter.

56:35.959 --> 56:38.450
A thousand pardons for
the lateness of the hour,

56:38.561 --> 56:40.028
Your Majesty.

56:40.130 --> 56:42.155
Am I not still awake?

56:42.265 --> 56:47.464
Your Majesty, I have a
matter of great importance to discuss.

56:47.570 --> 56:51.438
Well then, keep us not
in suspense, Mordecai.

56:51.541 --> 56:54.135
It is a matter
that concerns the king.

56:54.244 --> 56:55.643
I am now
the king's prime minister;

56:55.745 --> 56:59.977
what concerns the king
concerns me.

57:00.083 --> 57:01.482
Merely another title.

57:01.584 --> 57:07.386
Yes, but one that
requires that you bow before me, Jew.

57:07.490 --> 57:10.482
There's not time,
Lord Haman.

57:10.593 --> 57:15.257
Great Majesty, moments
ago did I hear Sardar,

57:15.365 --> 57:18.459
the commander of your army;
and Teres, your bodyguard,

57:18.568 --> 57:20.160
plot your assassination.

57:20.270 --> 57:21.669
My assassination?

57:21.771 --> 57:26.003
Your Majesty,
this man has lost his senses.

57:26.109 --> 57:30.409
He's accusing His Majesty's two
of his most faithful servants?

57:30.513 --> 57:32.378
Your Majesty
must act at once.

57:32.482 --> 57:36.009
The plot
commences at midnight.

57:36.119 --> 57:37.609
Your Majesty,
as your prime minister,

57:37.721 --> 57:41.213
I advise you to send this
man back to his bedroom.

57:41.324 --> 57:42.985
Obviously he has had
too much to drink.

57:43.093 --> 57:45.561
Overruled!

57:45.662 --> 57:48.825
We will investigate
these charges,

57:48.932 --> 57:53.426
for Mordecai would have
no cause to deceive me.

57:53.536 --> 57:55.663
Your Majesty.

57:55.772 --> 58:00.004
Send for Sardar and Teres,

58:00.110 --> 58:04.444
we will find the truth
of this matter.

58:28.872 --> 58:31.238
What troubles
my husband now?.

58:31.341 --> 58:33.707
Have another of his
schemes come to naught?

58:33.810 --> 58:37.507
Taunt me no further, woman,
or I shall banish you

58:37.614 --> 58:40.082
as I have banished
my daughter.

58:40.183 --> 58:42.083
Yes, Husband,
banish me to the palace

58:42.185 --> 58:44.619
where I too shall
serve Queen Esther.

58:44.721 --> 58:48.179
Oh, silence.

58:48.291 --> 58:51.385
Am I not the
king's prime minister?

58:51.494 --> 58:54.554
Is not everyone required
to bow before me?

58:54.664 --> 58:58.930
Why does this revolting Jew
Mordecai refuse to pay me honor?

58:59.035 --> 59:01.469
I suspect he has found
favor in the king's eyes.

59:01.571 --> 59:04.904
This Mordecai shall not live
and neither shall his people.

59:05.008 --> 59:08.500
Propose you then...murder?

59:08.611 --> 59:12.012
I shall arrange
for their execution.

59:12.115 --> 59:15.107
A fine, subtle distinction,
but a difficult task,

59:15.218 --> 59:18.187
for the Jewish people are
very loyal to their king.

59:18.288 --> 59:20.313
Then what if they
were found to be disloyal?

59:20.423 --> 59:24.257
An unlikely event.

59:24.360 --> 59:26.658
I must get my hands on
as much of the Jewish writings

59:26.763 --> 59:29.095
as I can find.

59:29.199 --> 59:32.259
Does my husband
wish to turn Hebrew?.

59:32.368 --> 59:36.134
Mordecai, he quotes his
people's writings selectively,

59:36.239 --> 59:39.174
but not fully I suspect.

59:39.275 --> 59:42.676
There's only one way
to discern this.

59:42.779 --> 59:47.307
Will you read all
the writings, Husband?

59:47.417 --> 59:49.442
I won't read any of them.

59:49.552 --> 59:51.611
It shall be done for me.

59:51.721 --> 59:53.416
And suppose
no treason is found?

59:53.523 --> 59:55.650
Then I shall create treason!

59:55.758 --> 59:59.023
We shall gather the
great architects of Persia

59:59.128 --> 01:00:04.430
and have them design gallows
fit for Mordecai, the Jew.

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:12.941
Finally, my wife comes up
with a sensible idea.

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:24.509
Teacher!
My queen!

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:28.622
And my dear, sweet Judith.

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:31.592
My darling child,
I mean, my queen.

01:00:31.694 --> 01:00:33.161
Oh!

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:39.330
And what think you
of the palace, Judith?

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:42.495
It has so many rooms,
a person could get lost.

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:44.163
Yes.

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:46.333
Who is this
lovely young girl?

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:49.206
Oh, this is Zara,
Lord Haman's daughter.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:50.711
I honor you, Mordecai.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:54.909
This beautiful woman
is Haman's daughter?

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:58.419
I confess to the truth of it,
but with no gladness of heart.

01:00:58.521 --> 01:01:01.820
My lovely girl,
I fear for your life.

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:04.951
Your father is a proud man,
easily angered.

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:06.528
I have no concern
for my life,

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:10.121
for Esther has promised
to take care of me.

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:22.137
My queen, I trust that you
have found marriage agreeable?

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:24.907
In truth, Teacher,
I find it bittersweet.

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:26.413
How so?

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:30.577
My husband, the king,
I so rarely see him.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:34.851
Surely the queen may see
the king at her pleasure?

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:36.516
Nay, Judith.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.321
A woman is not to enter
the king's presence

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:40.953
unless she be summoned,
even the queen.

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:44.124
Aye, if Jacob
had such a law,

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.791
he would spend
even more time alone.

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:47.301
Judith.

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:50.338
And likely be
grateful for the silence.

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:55.540
I would be put to death
were I too to disobey.

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:59.877
Lord Haman has lately kept
the king heavily engaged

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:02.110
with the affairs of state.

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:04.118
I doubt not the
king's love for me,

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:08.020
but I fear my rival is Persia
for the king's affection.

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:09.887
Fear not, my queen.

01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:12.223
If the king loves you
as well as Persia,

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:14.853
then he loves you
well indeed.

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:18.263
As always, my Teacher
speaks the truth.

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:22.464
My queen,
you have learned well.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:29.037
Come Judith,
I have much to show you.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:40.414
All hail,
King Xerxes of Persia.

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:42.616
Hail, King Xerxes!

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:46.320
Lord Haman, I should have
chosen you for a consort,

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:50.297
for I spend more time with you
than I spend with the queen.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.995
Your Majesty, this is
a matter of extreme urgency.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:56.936
For the sake of your
neck, Lord Haman,

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.441
I require that it be
a matter of life or death.

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:04.741
Your Majesty,
this is a matter of treason.

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:07.213
Treason?

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:10.717
Am I surrounded by
nothing but conspirators?

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.378
If my throne is in
peril, Lord Haman,

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:15.582
why then are we
completely unaware?

01:03:15.692 --> 01:03:20.129
Because, Your Majesty, the
threat comes not from without.

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:25.189
The threat
comes from within.

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:31.262
And only now you
bring this to my attention?

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.966
Your Majesty,

01:03:33.076 --> 01:03:35.806
there is a group of people in
your kingdom who are disloyal.

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:38.847
And who are
these disloyal people?

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:41.712
The Jews, Your Majesty.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:42.876
The Jews?

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.452
They support another?

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.959
Impossible!

01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:55.087
The evidence
lies here before you.

01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:59.726
Am I Jew, Lord Haman,
that I can read such things?

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:03.602
Then allow us
to translate.

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:11.413
''Sing praises to God.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:14.847
''Sing praises to our King.

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:19.581
''For God is the King
of all the earth.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.658
''It is God
who reigneth over the people.

01:04:22.759 --> 01:04:27.253
It is God
who sitteth upon the throne.''

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:30.321
If this is not proof
of treason, Your Majesty,

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:33.368
then I cannot
produce any.

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:41.037
They repay my generosity
with insolence?

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:45.444
Your Majesty,
if it pleases you,

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:50.417
I have chosen the 13th day of
the 12th month, Your Majesty.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.785
Let on this day
every traitorous Jew,

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.917
young, old, women,
children, be annihilated.

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:07.827
Azada...

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:12.237
Let it be done
as Lord Haman commands.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.370
By your word, Your Majesty.

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.054
Who calls?

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:28.555
The lady
Zara, Your Majesty.

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:30.125
Enter at once.

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:33.986
A visitor to see
Your Majesty?

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.563
Enter.

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.239
I honor you, my queen.

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:49.141
Judith, it's so
good to see you.

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:50.769
But the bad news I bring

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.543
will surely hurt
Your Majesty's heart.

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.982
I come at the
request of Mordecai.

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:59.452
Why does he
not come himself?

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:00.954
Because, my queen,

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:04.925
Mordecai sits at home
in sackcloth and ashes.

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:07.757
Judith, you must
tell me this news at once.

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:12.292
Shall I speak
freely, my queen?

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:15.370
Lady Zara
has my confidence.

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:20.167
It is the wicked
Lord Haman, my queen.

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:23.074
He has convinced
your husband, the king,

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:28.412
to destroy all the Jews.

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:35.218
No, this cannot be.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:37.849
On the 13th of this month,

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:43.023
all the Jews
will be put to death,

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:46.033
including you.

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:50.599
I've said too much.

01:06:50.706 --> 01:06:53.675
Zara, I beg you
to keep this a secret.

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:55.403
My lady, I would
never betray you.

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.912
My father is an evil man and
I beg you a thousand pardons.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:00.812
It's no fault
of yours, Zara.

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:04.045
There's no need
for forgiveness.

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:13.584
What is Mordecai's advice?

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:16.529
He asks that
you go to the king

01:07:16.632 --> 01:07:21.763
to beg him for mercy
and plead for our people.

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:25.639
Judith, I cannot,

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:28.141
for no woman is permitted
to enter the king's presence

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:30.371
without being summoned.

01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:33.141
Even the queen
must obey this law.

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:36.218
Then this
is Mordecai's answer...

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:44.992
There is a time
to remain silent

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:48.655
and a time to speak,

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:51.824
but if you
remain silent now,

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:56.132
you and your people
will perish.

01:07:56.238 --> 01:08:01.403
Is it not possible that you have
come to your royal position

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:04.445
for such a time as this?

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:05.138
Judith, I...

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:24.430
Go then, and tell Mordecai
to gather all the Jews of Persia

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:27.093
and have them fast for me.

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:30.969
They shall not eat or drink
for 3 days, day or night,

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:35.475
and I shall do the same,

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:40.072
and then I will
go to the king.

01:08:40.182 --> 01:08:45.848
And if I perish,
I shall perish.

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:50.118
It will be done
as you say, my queen.

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:33.657
I beg you, my queen,
do not make this mistake.

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:36.100
The king is
a man of his word,

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:39.640
and you will surely
be put to death.

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:44.236
Azada, do not fear.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:49.316
Now take me at once
to the king.

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:54.117
I honor you,
Queen Esther.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.604
Tell me, Lord Haman,

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:14.733
that this concludes
our business for the day.

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:17.369
If Your Majesty commands it

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.880
then we shall
continue at another time.

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:23.816
I do command it.

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:26.581
By your word,
Great Majesty.

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:37.459
I honor you,
King Xerxes.

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:39.761
What is the meaning
of this intrusion?

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:42.360
Lord Haman.

01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:45.929
The queen is here to
see you, Your Majesty.

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:49.602
Summoned you the queen,
great king?

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:51.839
I did not.

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:06.194
Esther, my queen.

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:09.526
Forgive my transgression,
Your Majesty,

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:12.624
for I know that
your word is the law.

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:15.636
Forgive my
transgression, my love,

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:18.036
for because of Lord Haman,

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:19.630
I have placed
the affairs of the state

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:23.405
above the affairs
of the heart.

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:29.918
If it pleases Your Majesty,
I would like to make a request.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:31.987
It does indeed please me.

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:34.487
My petition is this:

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.080
Let Your Majesty
come tomorrow

01:11:36.192 --> 01:11:38.353
to a banquet
which I will prepare.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.623
You and Lord Haman.

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:44.255
Then I will make
my request known.

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:46.561
What say you, Lord Haman?

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:50.400
Your Majesty...

01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:54.966
I wouldn't dream of declining
such a gracious invitation.

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:57.611
Then let it be done.

01:11:57.713 --> 01:12:00.807
Thank you, my king.

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:37.678
Does my wife
adore her husband?

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:41.187
Your persistence
exceeds your cruelty,

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:44.282
a quality much
to be admired.

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.156
Do we not have everything?

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:47.661
A great name.

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:49.230
Ah, and vast wealth.

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:51.526
And revenge.

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:53.534
And with the king
under my thumb,

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:56.605
the house of Haman
rules.

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:06.074
Oh, I forgot to mention,
my dear, beautiful wife,

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:08.979
that I am the only person
the queen has invited

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:11.279
to the royal banquet
for the king.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:12.979
Queen Esther?

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:15.056
What a bizarre invitation.

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:16.624
Surely she knows

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:20.024
what will become of her
benefactor, Mordecai.

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:22.359
Mention not that name.

01:13:22.464 --> 01:13:25.729
His demise
will be soon enough.

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:30.237
It is the queen who
arouses my suspicion.

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:34.708
Harbor no such thoughts,
dear wife.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:38.712
It is the king who
controls the queen,

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:45.242
but it is I who
controls the king.

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:06.832
Is my husband, the king,
well pleased?

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:09.376
As well pleased
as I am well fed.

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:11.036
And you, Lord Haman?

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:12.807
The pleasure of this meal

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:16.544
is matched only by the pleasure
of the queen's company.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.416
Queen Esther,
what is your petition?

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:23.923
Ask and it shall be granted.

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:26.324
Whatever you request,
even up to half my kingdom,

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:28.521
I will give it to you.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.928
If it pleases
Your Majesty,

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:36.061
grant me my life and spare my
people, for this is my request.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:42.467
Esther, my love,
you make a strange petition.

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:45.172
Who has threatened your life?

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.807
A great enemy,
Your Majesty.

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:50.885
Lord Haman.

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:58.324
Lord Haman, would you
molest a queen in her own home?

01:14:58.427 --> 01:15:02.193
Your Majesty,
the queen is surely mistaken.

01:15:02.297 --> 01:15:05.391
I would never
lay a hand on her.

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:08.868
Lord Haman speaks falsely,
Your Majesty,

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:12.498
for he has ordered the
destruction of my people

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:15.202
and me.

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:20.338
If he had merely made us slaves,
I would have remained silent,

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:24.010
for there would be no need
to disturb the king.

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:29.716
Lord Haman, have you
an answer to this accusation?

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:35.786
Your Majesty, I know not
of what this queen speaks of.

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:38.366
Lord Haman knows full well,
Your Majesty,

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:40.435
for did he not cause you
to order the destruction

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.003
of the Jews?

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:43.765
The Jews?

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:47.069
They are a treacherous
people, my queen.

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:49.701
Lord Haman has
shown me the evidence.

01:15:49.812 --> 01:15:51.245
Has he indeed?

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:53.405
Your Majesty, may I ask,

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:57.349
what has this matter
got to do with the other?

01:15:57.453 --> 01:16:01.321
Only that the Jews
are my people.

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:05.154
If they be found traitors,
let me be guilty as well.

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:09.229
This cannot be.

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:12.630
Your Majesty,
perhaps the queen is unwell.

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:15.601
Please, I beg you
to have mercy on her.

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:18.832
You would beg mercy for me
yet deny it to my people

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:20.533
and Mordecai?

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:26.974
Is he a traitor?

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:28.777
Has it not been
recorded in history

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:31.375
that Mordecai
once saved your life?

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:33.921
Does a traitor
conspire against himself?

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.512
Great Majesty...

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:40.994
Were not for Mordecai,
Esther would not be my queen.

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:44.554
Yes, that is indeed true.

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:47.226
I have made
a terrible mistake.

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:49.998
One that is easily
rectified, Your Majesty.

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:54.132
You will simply have to
find yourself another queen.

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:56.711
I have condemned
a man to death

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:59.872
without first giving him the
opportunity to defend himself,

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:03.247
he and his people.

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:04.819
Azada!
Yes, my king?

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:12.151
Send for Mordecai at once
and summon my counselors.

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:17.255
I wish for everyone to hear
the testimony tomorrow at noon.

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:19.994
By your word, King Xerxes.

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:25.835
Then we shall
know the truth.

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:54.329
All hail,
King Xerxes of Persia!

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:57.200
Hail, King Xerxes!

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:18.985
Men of Persia, this day
I have summoned you to hear the case

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:22.530
against the Jewish people.

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:25.327
I was persuaded
of their guilt

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:28.961
and sentenced them
to a violent death,

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:33.098
all the Jews, all the Jews,

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:36.905
including Mordecai

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:39.344
and my queen.

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:45.584
But as Lord Haman
once pronounced,

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:48.679
the king who judges quickly
judges not wisely.

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:52.726
And in this event,
he is correct.

01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:57.697
Therefore I shall
ask Lord Haman again

01:18:57.799 --> 01:19:00.233
to present his case
against the Jews.

01:19:00.335 --> 01:19:07.298
But this time, Mordecai will
be allowed to defend the Jews.

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:16.182
Lord Haman?

01:19:16.284 --> 01:19:21.278
Your Majesty, as I
believe I have so eloquently proven,

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:23.756
that the Jews are
a traitorous people,

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:29.923
who honor their God
and despise their king,

01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:32.865
and as their
writings also affirm,

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:35.266
it is their God
who rules them,

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:39.773
and it is their God
who sits upon the throne.

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:47.239
Mordecai, have you
an answer to this charge?

01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:51.547
Your Majesty, Lord Haman
does indeed quote the writings

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:56.852
of my people accurately,
but not completely,

01:19:56.958 --> 01:20:02.123
for it also written
that God establishes kings.

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:09.193
Therefore to disobey the king
would be to disobey God.

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:18.373
Mordecai,
I must ask you in truth

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:24.612
if you are and always have been
an obedient servant to me?

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:29.453
Your Majesty knows
well the answer to that question,

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:32.584
for I have served you
faithfully and obediently

01:20:32.694 --> 01:20:38.132
all these years, and
indeed your father before you.

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:40.463
Of this, Mordecai,
I am certain.

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:42.901
But I must also ask you,

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:48.636
are you also an obedient
servant of your God?

01:20:48.744 --> 01:20:51.770
Your Majesty
also knows well

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.043
that as a Jew from
the Tribe of Benjamin,

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:58.517
I am an obedient
servant to my God.

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:02.021
That was
quite elegant, Mordecai,

01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:03.785
if not a bit deceptive.

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:05.757
But answer me this,
Mordecai:

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.692
What if there was
a contradiction?

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:11.163
What if His Majesty
commanded one thing

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:15.134
and your God
commanded another?

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:18.365
Who then, Mordecai,
would you obey?

01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:22.173
Mordecai?

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:26.509
For many years
I have lived in peace

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:30.142
and prospered in the
service of Your Majesty.

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:32.277
But before Your Majesty
came to be,

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:35.288
my people worshipped
the God of Israel,

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:40.020
a living God who brought
my people out of Egypt

01:21:40.128 --> 01:21:43.586
and delivered them
from slavery.

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:47.998
To Your Majesty
I owe my living,

01:21:48.103 --> 01:21:51.368
but to my God,
I owe my life.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.302
Traitor!

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.809
Order, order!

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:06.217
Mordecai, perhaps you
did not understand my question.

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:09.085
These are words
of treason, Your Majesty,

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:11.989
straight from the
traitor's own lips.

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:20.033
Order, order!

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:22.865
Your Majesty, you have
permitted Mordecai to speak

01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:24.996
on behalf of his people.

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:27.802
Permit me now to speak
on behalf of Mordecai.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:34.677
As you wish, Esther.

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:40.983
Your Majesty, have you not
always granted the Jewish people

01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:45.549
the freedom to worship
their God in peace?

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:50.495
My love, it has indeed
been my pleasure,

01:22:50.599 --> 01:22:56.094
but it was also the will
of the late king, my father.

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:59.071
Therefore I must ask you,
great king,

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:02.575
when ever did you issue an
order to my Teacher, Mordecai,

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:05.840
which he did not obey?

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:11.579
In truth, dear Esther,
I cannot recall such an event.

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:15.554
Your Majesty cannot recall it
because it has not happened.

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:21.562
Your Majesty, this
Jewish queen pleads too late.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:28.125
She acts out of preservation for
her title as well as her life.

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:32.696
Did not once
Mordecai save your life?

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:37.039
And did you not reward him with
a royal robe and a royal horse?

01:23:37.145 --> 01:23:40.444
And was it not Lord Haman
who recommended it?

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:44.746
Your Majesty, the
question that was asked was

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:50.416
what would be done for the man
that the king wishes to honor?.

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:53.392
I thought His Majesty
was referring to me.

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:59.091
Therefore, Your Majesty,

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.966
I pose to you the same
question Lord Haman asks:

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:08.008
If a king commands one thing
and God commands another,

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:11.670
how would you have
this conflict resolved?

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:30.997
I would have a man
follow his own conscience,

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:38.296
for even kings have been
known to make mistakes.

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:52.552
I find no treason
in Mordecai or his people

01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:57.614
and he shall continue to serve
me with honor and distinction.

01:25:01.062 --> 01:25:02.723
And his people shall live.

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:14.435
Lord Haman, I am not yet
finished with you,

01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:20.276
for we must still address
the issue of your treason.

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:23.741
My treason?

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:26.514
For the havoc
you have created

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:29.021
and for the terrible
advice you have rendered

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.751
as prime minister,

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:34.420
I hereby
sentence you to death.

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:43.196
And I command that a gallows
be built as quickly as possible

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:45.772
with which to execute you.

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:49.537
Gracious Majesty,
in his infinite wisdom,

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:52.807
Haman has already
prepared such a gallows.

01:25:52.914 --> 01:25:56.873
Though it was
tailored for Mordecai,

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:03.015
I am sure you will find it
for him a perfect fit.

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:14.360
I am repaid
with my own coin.

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:16.096
To the gallows at once.

01:26:17.439 --> 01:26:18.838
Azada.

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.669
I honor you, King Xerxes.

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:24.211
Remove at once
Haman's royal robe

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:26.439
and place it upon Mordecai,

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:31.679
for it is Mordecai who
will now be my prime minister.

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:44.889
These events shall be
recorded in history.

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:47.695
By your word, Your Majesty.

01:26:47.802 --> 01:26:50.236
And henceforth forever

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:55.366
this will be, for the Jews,
a time of joy and happiness,

01:26:55.477 --> 01:26:59.675
and let it be written
that it is Queen Esther

01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:03.182
who has saved her people
from the villain Haman.

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:07.621
Queen Esther!

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:12.015
Azada, take this man away.

01:27:12.127 --> 01:27:15.290
It shall be done
as you say.

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:22.232
Mordecai, now that you
are second in rank to the king,

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:28.139
command a banquet to be held
with much food and wine.

01:27:29.344 --> 01:27:30.971
Your Majesty.

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:33.980
For I would command it myself,

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:37.449
but I wish to be alone
with my queen.

01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:45.826
Hail, King Xerxes!
