00:01.328 --> 00:03.433
Seriously funny. Sah!

00:03.597 --> 00:05.372
Deafening silence. Fwa, fwa!

00:05.533 --> 00:06.671
Original copies.

00:08.568 --> 00:09.877
Found missing!

00:12.940 --> 00:14.715
"Student teacher"?

00:15.509 --> 00:16.715
Liquid gas.

00:18.713 --> 00:20.454
Clearly confused.

00:20.815 --> 00:21.816
- Living dead!
- Oh!

00:22.516 --> 00:24.518
"Almost exactly."

00:24.685 --> 00:26.358
Genuine imitation.

00:27.621 --> 00:30.033
- Accidentally an purpose.
- Aah.

00:30.491 --> 00:32.232
Jumbo shrimp.

<i>And even though
he never said a word...</i>

00:58.352 --> 01:02.562
<i>...for the first time since Dad died,
I felt like I had someone to talk to.</i>

01:14.001 --> 01:15.571
No one's there

01:20.307 --> 01:22.514
Ring it again and I'll kill you!

01:24.745 --> 01:27.248
- What are you doing?
- Get out of there!

01:38.425 --> 01:39.631
Hey, you!

01:46.133 --> 01:47.441
What are you doing with that camera?

01:48.769 --> 01:50.976
So haw came you stopped talking?

01:55.976 --> 01:57.956
I did some extensive research.

01:58.112 --> 02:00.854
You know, it's medically impossible
to stop talking...

02:01.048 --> 02:03.995
...unless your vocal cards
are taken out or cut...

02:04.151 --> 02:07.462
.or diseased with carcinoma
of the larynx or something.

02:07.955 --> 02:11.596
It said, "Otherwise,
it is a hysterical reaction...

02:11.759 --> 02:13.864
...ta a singularly traumatic event...

02:14.061 --> 02:17.201
...in which the person makes
a psychological decision not to speak...

02:17.364 --> 02:20.277
...because speaking would
re-create the event."

02:21.836 --> 02:23.577
Just thought you should know.

02:38.886 --> 02:42.732
Wait! I can't crass this!
The bridge isn't safe.

02:43.224 --> 02:44.828
I might fall through.

02:55.669 --> 02:58.240
I can't read what
you're writing from there.

03:12.386 --> 03:16.857
<i>He wrote, "If you cross the bridge,
I'll tell you my story. "</i>

03:17.691 --> 03:21.969
Wait for me! Don't go tan far!
Wait for me!

03:22.930 --> 03:26.878
<i>He also wrote,
"Let's take a break and we'll talk. "</i>

03:31.405 --> 03:34.215
We can't! We only just started.

03:37.044 --> 03:38.387
Wait here.

03:52.693 --> 03:54.468
Don't leave me!

04:01.201 --> 04:02.271
Hello?

04:28.128 --> 04:29.732
Did you hear me?

04:36.003 --> 04:37.778
There's no one here!

05:17.311 --> 05:19.518
You promised not to leave me.

05:26.387 --> 05:28.025
What's he saying?

05:29.990 --> 05:31.435
Okay. Uh...

05:31.592 --> 05:35.506
He's saying,
"I have lived in many places...

05:36.230 --> 05:39.109
...but I was barn in Germany.

05:39.299 --> 05:43.008
After the war, I gut married.

05:43.570 --> 05:49.179
There was a child,
but I was tan afraid to be a father.

05:50.010 --> 05:55.483
When I was a young bay,
I was in a bomb shelter with my parents.

05:55.649 --> 06:00.894
A bomb exploded,
and they were bath killed."

06:01.321 --> 06:02.959
Is that why you stopped talking?

06:04.324 --> 06:06.270
I'll get you a soda, kid.

06:08.362 --> 06:10.069
Is that when you stopped talking?

06:30.751 --> 06:33.231
I want you to came with me
from new an.

06:48.268 --> 06:51.374
<i>And he shrugged the way Dad did.</i>

06:51.972 --> 06:53.417
<i>I loved that.</i>

07:41.522 --> 07:44.162
<i>A month of Saturdays and Sundays
he'd come with</i> me...

07:44.324 --> 07:47.328
<i>...and we'd seen 37 more Blacks.</i>

07:53.000 --> 07:54.445
Na, nu, nu!

07:55.202 --> 07:56.806
You have to watch what you're doing.

07:56.970 --> 08:00.144
Cassidy Black doesn't live in Glendale.
She lives in Woodhaven.

08:00.307 --> 08:02.184
Here, let me help you.

08:05.479 --> 08:07.322
<i>Aurelia Black lives in Whitestone.</i>

08:07.814 --> 08:09.555
<i>Baz Black lives in Flushing.</i>

08:10.083 --> 08:11.357
<i>Bea Black lives in Rosedale.</i>

08:12.085 --> 08:14.588
<i>B.G. Black lives in Sunnyside.
Got it?</i>

08:17.391 --> 08:20.372
Tomorrow we can make it
to Amara Black...

08:20.527 --> 08:23.997
...in zone JJ, map grid AN-50,
Mill Basin.

08:26.366 --> 08:30.041
Rule number seven,
nothing gets in the way of the search.

08:58.065 --> 09:00.136
Hello, my name is Oskar Schell
My father...

09:00.300 --> 09:01.574
Wrong way!

09:28.262 --> 09:29.673
Enjoying that?

09:34.835 --> 09:38.977
You know, I don't say anything when you
walk too slowly because you can't help it.

09:39.139 --> 09:41.915
And I don't say anything when you go
to the bathroom three times an hour...

09:42.075 --> 09:43.679
...because I know you need ta.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.687
But you could eat a little faster!

09:45.846 --> 09:49.350
It was James Black,
Dan Black, Amos Black...

09:49.549 --> 09:52.655
...Guthrie Black,
and all three Ben Blacks.

09:53.086 --> 09:54.463
Pointless.

09:57.357 --> 09:58.597
We're not finished.

10:01.361 --> 10:03.363
Hey, guys, I gut a wife and kid
to get home ta.

10:03.563 --> 10:06.009
Please! Just give me a minute.

10:12.406 --> 10:13.908
Right.

10:19.813 --> 10:20.848
Ben Black.

10:29.623 --> 10:30.966
Guthrie Black.

10:36.697 --> 10:37.971
Amos Black.

11:01.355 --> 11:03.892
Da you really expect me
to go out there and see what I...

11:04.057 --> 11:06.333
Hey, kid, you need a master key.

11:43.196 --> 11:44.766
I can't!

12:25.472 --> 12:28.783
If I ask you a question,
will you tell me the truth?

12:30.444 --> 12:32.788
Even if it will hurt me?

12:37.250 --> 12:39.287
Do you think the key fits a lack?

12:45.859 --> 12:46.963
Really?

12:51.598 --> 12:52.941
I mean really?

12:59.506 --> 13:01.486
And do you think we'll find the lack?

13:21.127 --> 13:23.300
I'm not so sure either.

13:37.711 --> 13:39.850
There's something I've gut to show you.

13:42.048 --> 13:45.495
<i>I couldn't be sure,
so I didn't say anything.</i>

13:45.652 --> 13:47.859
<i>But I felt it all the time.</i>

13:48.522 --> 13:52.402
The way he walked,
the way he shrugged his shoulders...

13:52.559 --> 13:55.699
<i>...the way my grandmother
wouldn't talk about him.</i>

13:56.229 --> 13:58.573
<i>He must be my grandfather.</i>

14:15.382 --> 14:16.918
<i>My mom is cut.</i>

14:54.921 --> 14:56.332
This way.

15:15.442 --> 15:17.251
You can sit an my bed.

15:27.754 --> 15:29.927
I printed these out from the Internet.

15:52.112 --> 15:53.819
This is probably him.

15:53.980 --> 15:55.926
Or it might be him.

15:56.716 --> 15:58.787
He's dressed like he was.

15:58.952 --> 16:03.298
When I magnify it until the dots are so big
it stops lacking like a person...

16:03.456 --> 16:06.027
...sometimes I can see glasses on him

16:08.161 --> 16:09.572
Or I think I can.

16:12.666 --> 16:15.237
Probably the other kids
see their dads tan.

16:25.345 --> 16:27.086
This is what I want to show you.

16:39.325 --> 16:44.001
On the worst day, my dad left six messages
an this answering machine.

16:48.401 --> 16:50.347
Na one else
has ever heard them but me.

16:58.978 --> 17:00.889
Especially not her.

17:02.382 --> 17:05.295
The first message was at 8:55.

17:05.484 --> 17:07.692
I was still waiting to be let into school.

17:07.854 --> 17:10.733
<i>I was playing with
Minch, wasting time.</i>

17:10.890 --> 17:13.200
Are you there? Hello?

17:14.394 --> 17:17.704
<i>I just tried the office,
but no one was picking up</i>

17:17.864 --> 17:20.810
<i>Uh, listen, uh, something's happened.
I'm okay.</i>

17:21.000 --> 17:23.276
<i>They're telling us to
stay where we</i> are.

17:27.006 --> 17:29.247
The second message was at 9:12.

17:29.809 --> 17:31.550
<i>I was in class by then.</i>

17:31.711 --> 17:32.883
...parallelogram.

17:33.213 --> 17:35.955
Okay, so, you take the beautiful,
magical parallelogram...

17:36.116 --> 17:37.754
...and you'll cut it into two beautiful...

17:37.917 --> 17:39.453
<i>It's me again.</i>

17:39.619 --> 17:40.654
<i>Hello?</i>

17:40.954 --> 17:43.992
<i>Sorry, look,
I was hoping you would be home.</i>

17:44.157 --> 17:46.034
<i>I don't know if you heard
about what happened...</i>

17:46.192 --> 17:48.900
<i>...but I just wanted you to know
that I'm okay.</i>

17:49.062 --> 17:52.134
<i>Everything is fine. We're still waiting
to find out what we're supposed to do.</i>

17:52.298 --> 17:55.370
<i>It's pretty chaotic.
Firemen are supposed to be coming. What...</i>

17:59.639 --> 18:02.620
The third message was at 9:58.

18:02.842 --> 18:05.413
A bunch of us were walking home
with Minch's mom...

18:05.578 --> 18:07.990
...wha said something was happening,
but didn't say what.

18:08.615 --> 18:13.155
<i>I stopped at a deli at the corner of
92nd and Broadway to get a Juicy Juice.</i>

18:13.586 --> 18:17.329
<i>I know I was there at that exact time
because I saved the receipt.</i>

18:17.624 --> 18:19.297
It had the time an it.

18:21.795 --> 18:23.138
Hello?

18:24.864 --> 18:25.968
<i>Hello?</i>

18:27.267 --> 18:28.302
<i>Hello?</i>

18:30.370 --> 18:31.747
<i>Hello?</i>

18:38.344 --> 18:39.880
I have to play you all of them.

18:42.182 --> 18:44.719
The fourth message was at 10:07.

18:44.884 --> 18:49.833
Given that the average walking speed for
a child my age is 4.4 feet per second...

18:50.223 --> 18:53.568
...and that it was 9 minutes
between those two messages...

18:53.726 --> 18:58.141
...I calculated that I walked 2375 feet...

18:58.298 --> 19:01.074
<i>...putting me in front of
the United Church on Broadway.</i>

19:01.234 --> 19:03.111
I know this because
I went back and measured.

19:04.904 --> 19:06.247
It's me.

19:07.907 --> 19:09.716
I was hoping you were home.

19:11.211 --> 19:15.717
<i>I really, really wanted to talk to you
I wanted to explain to you...</i>

19:17.050 --> 19:19.860
<i>Wait, wait, no, no, I'm just gonna be
another minute, I'm sorry.</i>

19:20.253 --> 19:22.358
<i>I can't use the phone for very long.</i>

19:22.722 --> 19:24.531
<i>So I wan ted to tell you...</i>

19:25.658 --> 19:27.228
<i>...how much I love you.</i>

19:30.663 --> 19:32.904
<i>I wanted to tell you
how much I love you.</i>

19:36.336 --> 19:38.680
The fifth message was at 10:17.

19:38.838 --> 19:41.045
I was talking to Stan the doorman
when Dad left this.

19:43.042 --> 19:44.350
Are you there?

19:45.879 --> 19:50.692
Are you there?
Please, <i>pick up</i> if you're there.

19:50.850 --> 19:52.295
No.

19:52.919 --> 19:56.457
There's one more message.
The sixth message.

19:57.757 --> 19:59.100
Ten twenty-seven.

21:54.874 --> 21:57.184
Hey! Wait a minute!

21:58.878 --> 22:00.050
What are you doing?

22:04.884 --> 22:06.886
Who said things
should be getting better?

22:12.792 --> 22:14.328
So that's it?

22:24.103 --> 22:25.548
Hey!

22:28.674 --> 22:30.449
Unh! You wanna go, so go!

22:30.676 --> 22:32.656
I always knew you were my grandfather.

22:32.812 --> 22:36.726
But if you think we'll miss you after you
go now, don't worry, because we won't!

22:38.051 --> 22:40.190
In fact, I should be saying thank you!

22:40.353 --> 22:44.096
My dad was the greatest dad in the world
because you were the worst!

22:44.257 --> 22:46.032
My dad went to
Bronx Science High School...

22:46.192 --> 22:49.696
...where he was manager of the baseball
team and science editor of the paper!

22:49.862 --> 22:53.708
When he graduated, he went to Rutgers,
where he majored in biochemistry.

22:53.866 --> 22:56.403
He met my mom in a bookstore,
and he asked her to marry him...

22:56.569 --> 22:59.709
...in Norwalk, Connecticut. And every
summer, we'd go back to Toby Pond..

22:59.872 --> 23:01.613
...and he would ask her
to marry him again.

23:01.774 --> 23:04.778
The day I was barn, he pressed leaves
between wax paper...

23:04.944 --> 23:08.084
<i>...and they still hang in the bedroom
window. He wanted to be a scientist...</i>

23:08.247 --> 23:10.727
<i>...but he became a jeweler
to eam money for our family.</i>

23:10.883 --> 23:13.762
He loved the smell of gasoline.
He hated tomatoes.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.093
He never talked to me like I was a kid.

23:16.255 --> 23:19.634
Sn, in a way,
your boats are heavier than mine.

24:45.311 --> 24:47.086
<i>Hello?
- Um...</i>

24:47.246 --> 24:49.226
Hello. My name is Oskar Schell.

24:49.382 --> 24:51.919
<i>Oskar? This is Abby Black.</i>

24:53.819 --> 24:57.062
<i>Are you there? Hello?</i>

25:10.469 --> 25:12.745
It's Oskar Schell! I'm here!

25:13.472 --> 25:16.009
Oskar, you've grown.

25:17.009 --> 25:20.582
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

25:21.948 --> 25:23.723
I don't take rides from strangers.

25:23.883 --> 25:27.262
That's a good rule,
but we're not entirely strangers.

25:28.020 --> 25:29.124
Get in.

25:37.630 --> 25:41.077
I told you when you were here before
I didn't know anything about the key.

25:41.234 --> 25:42.542
But you do.

25:42.735 --> 25:44.408
Well, my husband...

25:45.805 --> 25:49.878
...ex-husband had the estate sale
you mentioned...

25:50.042 --> 25:52.044
so I think you should talk to him

25:52.211 --> 25:53.747
Where's your ex-husband?

25:53.913 --> 25:56.917
At work. I'm gonna take you to him now.

25:57.383 --> 25:58.589
On Sunday night?

25:59.318 --> 26:01.594
It's Monday morning in Japan.

26:23.476 --> 26:26.218
Okay. He said you should
came right up.

26:28.648 --> 26:29.956
32nd flour.

26:30.383 --> 26:31.589
Aren't you coming?

26:32.451 --> 26:34.260
I'll wait here.

26:49.702 --> 26:50.840
Goad luck.

27:36.415 --> 27:37.723
Came in.

27:46.726 --> 27:47.761
Hello.

27:48.594 --> 27:49.629
Hello.

27:49.995 --> 27:52.066
What can I do for you?
What's going an?

27:52.598 --> 27:54.339
Do you know my father?

27:54.734 --> 27:56.771
Your father? Who's your father?

27:57.503 --> 27:58.641
Thomas Schell.

28:00.239 --> 28:03.345
I don't think so.
I don't know any Schells.

28:04.176 --> 28:05.416
He died at 9/11.

28:07.279 --> 28:11.955
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- I found an envelope with your name on it...

28:12.118 --> 28:14.530
...and I thought it was your wife,
who I know new is your ex-wife...

28:14.687 --> 28:16.257
...but she didn't know
anything about it...

28:16.422 --> 28:18.629
...and there was a man
yelling from the other roam.

28:18.791 --> 28:21.704
- What do you know about my father?
- When was this?

28:22.128 --> 28:25.701
Three months and 17 days,
eight hours...

28:25.865 --> 28:29.369
...15 minutes,
11, and new 12 seconds ago.

28:30.202 --> 28:32.443
And tonight, at 1:42:45 p. m...

28:32.605 --> 28:35.814
...I found a newspaper clipping where
my dad had circled "nut stop lacking"...

28:35.975 --> 28:38.353
and I found a telephone number
on the back.

28:38.677 --> 28:40.520
And the number was for Abby Black.

28:41.647 --> 28:45.561
That was me. At the house.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.692
I was moving cut.

28:47.853 --> 28:50.629
- I know.
- Hm.

28:51.957 --> 28:54.198
What was so special
about the envelope?

28:59.832 --> 29:00.867
Can I see that?

29:09.141 --> 29:11.621
Was there anything written
an the envelope?

29:12.044 --> 29:13.717
It said "Black".

29:15.347 --> 29:18.260
And did you find it in a blue vase?

29:21.520 --> 29:23.193
<i>Hm?</i>

29:23.989 --> 29:25.662
I don't believe it.

29:26.158 --> 29:28.764
This is truly the mast amazing thing.

29:28.928 --> 29:31.204
I have been lacking for this key...

29:31.363 --> 29:32.933
...far more than a year.

29:33.566 --> 29:36.172
I've spent months trying
to find the lack that it fits.

29:36.335 --> 29:39.714
- Then we've been lacking for each other.
- What does it open?

29:40.473 --> 29:41.781
A safe-deposit box.

29:41.941 --> 29:43.784
What's it gut to do with my dad?

29:43.943 --> 29:45.354
With your dad?

29:46.545 --> 29:50.288
I found it in my dad's closet, and since he's
dead, I couldn't ask him what it meant...

29:50.449 --> 29:52.156
so I had to go find out for myself

29:54.053 --> 29:55.760
Well, uh...

29:58.157 --> 30:00.296
...my dad passed away tan.

30:00.860 --> 30:02.669
A couple of years ago.

30:04.897 --> 30:06.103
He, um...

30:06.265 --> 30:07.676
He went in for a...

30:08.701 --> 30:11.409
...checkup and, um... Ahem.

30:17.042 --> 30:18.419
Anyway...

30:19.812 --> 30:24.659
...next thing you know,
doctor says he has two months to live.

30:30.089 --> 30:34.333
I needed to figure out what to do
with his things, his backs, his furniture.

30:34.493 --> 30:37.440
- Didn't you want to keep them?
- I didn't want any of it.

30:39.465 --> 30:41.342
<i>I had an estate sale.</i>

30:42.701 --> 30:45.204
<i>My father and I weren't
exactly close.</i>

30:46.739 --> 30:49.948
He spent his last couple of months
writing to everyone...

30:50.109 --> 30:53.283
cousins, business partners,
people I'd never heard of.

30:53.846 --> 30:56.520
He wrote about all the things
he wanted to do but never did...

30:56.682 --> 30:59.993
...and all the things he did do
but didn't want ta.

31:02.421 --> 31:05.300
Shared all the things
he never shared with me.

31:08.260 --> 31:11.833
You know, all the
things that I wanted to know about him.

31:13.465 --> 31:15.138
Do you need a hug?

31:16.135 --> 31:18.012
I'll be okay, thanks.

31:18.504 --> 31:20.245
Didn't he write a letter to you?

31:21.607 --> 31:23.985
Yeah, but I was afraid to open it.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.453
I would have been extremely curious.

31:26.612 --> 31:29.286
Well, my wife told me
I was being ridiculous.

31:29.949 --> 31:33.192
- Childish.
- But you were his child.

31:36.822 --> 31:40.167
I was afraid it was gonna be
some sort of confessional.

31:40.326 --> 31:43.466
I was hoping he would <i>tell me</i>
he was sorry...

31:44.063 --> 31:45.770
...or that he loved me.

31:46.398 --> 31:49.345
<i>Or something personal about us,
but he didn't.</i>

31:50.836 --> 31:54.147
At the end of the letter, he says:

31:54.840 --> 31:57.650
"There's something that I want you
to have in the blue vase...

31:57.810 --> 31:59.653
...an the shelf in the bedroom.

31:59.812 --> 32:02.816
<i>I think you'll understand why
I wanted you to have it."</i>

32:05.184 --> 32:07.664
But I had sold the blue vase!
Or I...

32:07.820 --> 32:13.202
Actually, I gave it away to your dad,
I guess, before I'd opened the letter.

32:14.059 --> 32:16.164
So that's why I've been trying to find it.

32:16.328 --> 32:18.103
You met my dad?

32:18.797 --> 32:20.367
I guess so.

32:20.532 --> 32:21.602
Do you remember him?

32:22.935 --> 32:26.178
Uh, he mentioned something
about an anniversary.

32:26.939 --> 32:28.714
September 14th.

32:29.008 --> 32:33.013
<i>And that he had a surprise
planned for your mom.</i>

32:33.178 --> 32:34.248
Happy anniversary.

32:34.413 --> 32:35.824
<i>Something about a fancy restaurant.</i>

32:36.448 --> 32:38.325
His tuxedo.

32:38.484 --> 32:39.861
Without the key, I was stuck.

32:41.587 --> 32:43.294
That's why you needed to find my dad.

32:43.455 --> 32:47.130
But I didn't know haw to find him.
I didn't even know his name.

32:47.326 --> 32:50.603
For a few weeks, I'd wander over
to my dad's neighborhood...

32:50.763 --> 32:52.265
<i>...hoping that I'd bump into him.</i>

32:52.431 --> 32:55.810
<i>I put up sighs saying that the guy
who got the vase at the estate sale..</i>

32:55.968 --> 32:57.845
<i>...at 75th Street,
please came contact me.</i>

32:59.772 --> 33:01.843
<i>But that was a week after...</i>

33:02.608 --> 33:05.919
<i>...well, you know, September 11th...</i>

33:07.913 --> 33:10.553
<i>...and people were putting up
posters everywhere.</i>

33:35.174 --> 33:36.619
Well...

33:38.777 --> 33:41.053
you don't have to look any more

34:05.704 --> 34:09.777
I'm sorry, I know you've been lacking
for something and this isn't it.

34:09.942 --> 34:11.319
It's okay.

34:13.779 --> 34:15.485
Let's you and I go to the bank.

34:15.647 --> 34:18.059
We'll find out what it is together,
we'll share it.

34:18.317 --> 34:21.560
You're nice. But nu, thank you.

34:29.728 --> 34:31.206
Hey, you're gonna be
all right there?

34:32.998 --> 34:35.569
Can I tell you something
I never told anybody else?

34:35.868 --> 34:37.438
Sure.

34:43.942 --> 34:48.254
On that day, they let us out of school
basically as scan as we gut there.

34:48.447 --> 34:50.016
I walked home.

34:50.581 --> 34:54.724
My friend told me he would call, so I went
to lack at the answering machine.

34:54.953 --> 34:56.455
There were all these messages.

34:56.722 --> 34:58.201
From your friend?

34:58.657 --> 35:00.364
From my dad.

35:01.593 --> 35:03.470
He was in the building.

35:04.663 --> 35:07.371
But there's something
I've never told anyone.

35:07.533 --> 35:10.070
Nat anybody else, not anybody ever.

35:12.504 --> 35:14.347
The phone rang.

35:15.941 --> 35:17.682
Oh, Gad.

35:41.366 --> 35:44.108
I couldn't pick up the phone.
I just couldn't do it.

35:44.269 --> 35:47.341
It rang, and rang, and rang,
and I couldn't move.

36:08.727 --> 36:12.072
I wanted to pick it up, but I couldn't.
I just couldn't.

36:13.065 --> 36:16.638
<i>The answering machine came on.
There was a beep.</i>

36:16.802 --> 36:18.577
Message six, September 11, 10:27 a.m.

36:18.737 --> 36:21.115
Then <i>I</i> heard Dad's voice.

36:22.541 --> 36:23.781
Are you there?

36:24.343 --> 36:25.981
"Are you there?"

36:26.578 --> 36:27.750
- "Are you there?"
Are you there?

36:28.947 --> 36:30.426
"Are you there?"

36:34.786 --> 36:37.289
He needed me and I couldn't pick it up.

36:37.856 --> 36:40.166
I was scared. I just couldn't do it.

36:40.759 --> 36:46.300
"Are you there?" He asked nine times.
I know because I've counted.

36:47.299 --> 36:49.506
And why didn't he say "Anyone"?

36:49.835 --> 36:54.807
"Is anyone there?"
"You" is just one person.

36:55.073 --> 36:57.417
I think he knew I was there.

36:57.776 --> 37:01.087
Maybe he kept saying it to give me time
to be brave enough to pick up.

37:02.681 --> 37:07.357
The longest space between the third
and the fourth, which is 15 seconds.

37:07.519 --> 37:08.657
Are you there?

37:08.820 --> 37:11.494
You can hear people
in the background crying.

37:11.723 --> 37:13.669
- Are you there?
- You <i>can</i> hear helicopters.

37:13.825 --> 37:15.168
Are you there?

37:15.327 --> 37:17.500
<i>You can hear glass breaking.</i>

37:17.663 --> 37:19.472
Are you there? Are you the...

37:20.799 --> 37:21.869
<i>Then it cut off.</i>

37:52.264 --> 37:53.937
Do you forgive me?

37:54.366 --> 37:55.868
Forgive you?

37:57.002 --> 37:59.505
For what?
For not being able to pick up?

38:01.673 --> 38:03.846
For not being able to tell anyone.

38:04.009 --> 38:06.011
Oh...

38:08.280 --> 38:10.282
Of course I forgive you.

38:13.719 --> 38:17.098
I can't tell you haw much better
that makes me feel.

38:20.659 --> 38:23.037
I hope you find what you're lacking far.

38:34.206 --> 38:35.378
I've gut to go.

38:56.995 --> 38:58.167
Thank you.

39:07.205 --> 39:08.582
What's he doing?

39:12.411 --> 39:13.913
Oskar!

40:23.849 --> 40:27.228
Hey, give it to me, give it to me,
give it to me, give it to me.

40:32.924 --> 40:34.665
It's okay, it's okay, give that to me.

40:34.826 --> 40:37.898
Give it to me, give it to me,
give it to me, it's okay.

40:38.063 --> 40:42.443
Let go, let go, let go, let go,
let go, let go, let go, let go.

40:42.601 --> 40:47.016
It's okay, I got it. It's all right.
Let go. Let go, let go, baby.

40:47.172 --> 40:51.052
Let it go, let it go, it's all right.
It's all right, let it go, let it go.

40:51.376 --> 40:55.552
Let it go. It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right. It's okay.

40:56.548 --> 41:00.394
I promise I'll be better scan, I promise!
I'll be normal!

41:00.886 --> 41:04.026
That is the last thing that I would want.
You are perfect.

41:04.890 --> 41:08.929
I tried incredibly hard, Mom. I don't know
howl could have tried any harder.

41:09.094 --> 41:10.630
I know you did.

41:10.962 --> 41:13.533
I know you did. I know you did.

41:14.199 --> 41:16.304
- You don't know.
- I do.

41:16.468 --> 41:18.414
But you really don't know, Mom.

41:18.570 --> 41:22.916
I know how proud your dad would
have been that you didn't stop looking.

41:24.843 --> 41:28.120
Sweetie, do you think I would ever
let you out of my sight?

41:28.280 --> 41:31.284
Do you think I would let
anything happen to you?

41:31.583 --> 41:33.392
I always knew where you were.

41:33.552 --> 41:34.997
Always.

41:35.587 --> 41:36.657
You did?

41:37.355 --> 41:40.564
When Stan the doorman told me about
all the phone books you said you needed...

41:40.725 --> 41:45.970
...for a school project on the census,
I knew you were up to something.

41:46.998 --> 41:48.443
How?

41:49.434 --> 41:52.438
The census
isn't for another seven years.

41:57.909 --> 42:01.482
So I went into your roam
and I tried to think like you did.

42:02.280 --> 42:04.157
I wanted to understand.

42:04.749 --> 42:06.285
You were snooping on me?

42:08.453 --> 42:10.592
I was searching for you.

42:16.861 --> 42:19.501
<i>I found your Enchanted Forest game
with the list of the Blacks.</i>

42:19.664 --> 42:22.201
<i>I saw your index system
of the five boroughs.</i>

42:22.367 --> 42:23.437
<i>My CZI.</i>

42:23.602 --> 42:25.047
Your CZI?

42:25.770 --> 42:27.511
Collapsible Zane Index.

42:27.672 --> 42:30.312
<i>I saw how you used the last
four digits of the phone numbers.</i>

42:30.475 --> 42:31.818
I thought that was clever.

42:32.077 --> 42:33.647
<i>That was very clever.</i>

42:34.679 --> 42:36.659
<i>I made my awn map.</i>

42:36.915 --> 42:38.986
And I marked up all your zones.

42:39.417 --> 42:41.055
One hundred and four.

42:42.320 --> 42:44.357
215 addresses.

42:44.689 --> 42:47.499
472 people named Black.

42:48.226 --> 42:51.469
I made a list of all the people
you were going to see that weekend.

42:51.630 --> 42:53.371
<i>I called the ones
you'd already been</i> to...

42:53.531 --> 42:56.910
<i>...and I went and met the ones
you were going to go see.</i>

42:57.068 --> 42:58.547
- You did?
Mm-hm.

42:59.571 --> 43:01.517
- All of them?
- Mm-hm.

43:03.241 --> 43:06.415
So since my husband's death, my son
has been searching all over the city...

43:06.578 --> 43:10.253
...with a key he thinks might be a clue,
so he's very...

43:10.415 --> 43:12.520
Um... Oh. Um...

43:12.684 --> 43:15.358
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you very much. Um...

43:15.520 --> 43:19.491
So, when he comes,
he tank this entire map and he...

43:20.525 --> 43:21.833
Thank you.

43:23.361 --> 43:24.704
Thank you very much.

43:25.463 --> 43:27.340
Thank you very much. Thank you.

43:27.499 --> 43:30.639
Um... Oh.

43:31.202 --> 43:32.237
Thank you.

43:32.404 --> 43:34.247
<i>Hector Black sure liked to hug.</i>

43:34.406 --> 43:36.408
<i>He hugged me 17 times.</i>

43:36.574 --> 43:39.180
I wanted to get away,
but he just kept on hugging

43:42.981 --> 43:46.690
And he feels that it's somehow
related to his father's death.

43:46.851 --> 43:48.888
I know, it's sad. It's a sad story.

43:51.222 --> 43:54.362
I liked Elaine Black
and her five noisy kids.

44:04.235 --> 44:05.509
<i>Did you get a drawing?</i>

44:06.104 --> 44:07.447
Dozens.

44:15.180 --> 44:20.323
So when he comes, maybe you guys
could let him sit an that and he cauld...

44:33.465 --> 44:35.502
<i>And what about Leigh-Anne Black?</i>

44:35.667 --> 44:37.544
She yelled <i>at me</i> to go away.

44:38.103 --> 44:39.605
Yeah, me tan.

44:39.771 --> 44:42.479
Whether or not you had
any connection to...

44:43.975 --> 44:47.115
Ga. Please, get out of here. Ga!

44:47.545 --> 44:50.253
Lana Black had an amazing story.

44:50.648 --> 44:53.128
I thought Lana Black
would burst into tears.

44:53.585 --> 44:58.056
He's gonna be fine. Just a few questions,
that's all he's gonna need.

44:58.556 --> 45:00.092
You sure you're okay with this?

45:03.561 --> 45:06.064
- She was fine when I gut there.
- Oh, yeah?

45:09.567 --> 45:14.107
I knew haw long it would take you to
get from Eleanor Black's in Astoria ta...

45:14.272 --> 45:16.309
...Harlan Black's in Bushwick.

45:18.009 --> 45:19.818
I'm really sorry about your father.

45:22.380 --> 45:24.587
- Mom, it's that bay!
- It's that bay!

45:28.186 --> 45:30.792
I think our mums lack kind of similar,
don't you?

45:34.759 --> 45:37.797
- So you knew about the key.
- Mm-hm.

45:38.663 --> 45:41.303
I knew you had to go
make sense of things.

45:41.466 --> 45:43.377
And I gut to go with you.

45:44.169 --> 45:45.876
You weren't ever worried
I was gonna be raped...

45:46.037 --> 45:48.574
or killed or strangled or stabbed
or something?

45:48.740 --> 45:50.151
Every hour of every day.

45:52.710 --> 45:54.485
<i>I couldn't breathe until
the door closed.</i>

45:54.646 --> 45:56.421
- Hey.
- I'm home.

45:58.883 --> 46:01.386
I thought only Dad could think like me.

46:02.287 --> 46:03.664
Me too.

46:05.356 --> 46:08.826
So many of them had last
something or somebody, Mom.

46:08.993 --> 46:10.768
Just like us.

46:14.999 --> 46:16.979
What do you miss about him?

46:20.905 --> 46:23.249
Oh, I miss so many things about him.

46:24.275 --> 46:27.415
I miss haw he could tell the weather
just by touching the window.

46:28.947 --> 46:30.927
When he would came
in the house and yell:

46:31.082 --> 46:33.528
"What's everybody doing?"

46:40.291 --> 46:43.568
I miss haw he would stick his entire arm
into the coffee beans at Fairway...

46:43.728 --> 46:45.207
- ...because he liked haw it felt.
- Ah.

46:45.363 --> 46:49.277
That would make me so angry because
everyone in the stare was watching him.

46:50.301 --> 46:53.908
- Were they?
- Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

46:58.376 --> 47:00.447
I miss his voice.

47:02.881 --> 47:05.828
I miss his voice telling me he loves me.

47:07.252 --> 47:08.663
Me too.

47:12.891 --> 47:14.632
- Mom?
- Mm?

47:15.460 --> 47:18.566
It's okay if you fall in love again.
If you want to.

47:21.199 --> 47:22.837
Oh.

47:23.268 --> 47:27.842
I'll never fall in love for the first time again.
Nobody can be him.

47:28.006 --> 47:29.212
Nobody.

47:33.278 --> 47:36.418
He told me. He said:

47:36.848 --> 47:40.091
"I really love your mother.
She's such a good girl."

47:55.934 --> 47:57.140
<i>Mom?</i>

48:00.438 --> 48:03.544
I don't tell you I love you
enough times, do I?

48:04.108 --> 48:05.678
Oh.

48:08.479 --> 48:10.049
Yes, you do.

48:10.982 --> 48:12.484
Oh, baby.

48:14.519 --> 48:15.964
You do.

48:29.767 --> 48:31.337
Stairs are broken.

48:31.502 --> 48:33.709
You're going to school awful early.

48:34.772 --> 48:37.184
There isn't any school today,
it's Presidents' Day.

48:37.976 --> 48:39.683
I thought that was in February.

48:40.278 --> 48:42.224
They changed it.

48:43.114 --> 48:44.388
Mm.

49:25.590 --> 49:28.298
<i>I'd written a letter
to the people I'd met.</i>

49:30.628 --> 49:34.303
<i>"Dear Mister or Missus or Miss...</i>

49:34.999 --> 49:38.879
<i>...or Abby or Hazelle
or Tommy or Elaine...</i>

49:39.070 --> 49:41.550
<i>...or anybody I'd met
whose last name is Black.</i>

49:42.974 --> 49:44.783
<i>You might remember me.</i>

49:45.143 --> 49:47.089
<i>My name is Oskar Schell.</i>

49:48.046 --> 49:50.720
<i>I came to visit you to see if you could
help me find the lock...</i>

49:50.882 --> 49:53.362
<i>...that fit the key I thought
my father had left me.</i>

49:54.986 --> 49:58.058
<i>Most of you were very helpful
and nice to me.</i>

49:58.489 --> 50:00.628
<i>I want to thank you for that.</i>

50:01.192 --> 50:04.230
<i>And I want to thank you
for the horse ride you gave me...</i>

50:04.395 --> 50:07.274
<i>...and for Taylor's picture
of me and my key.</i>

50:08.399 --> 50:11.937
<i>You might want to know,
the key wasn't meant for me.</i>

50:13.171 --> 50:15.674
<i>It was meant for a Mr.
William Black...</i>

50:15.840 --> 50:18.980
<i>...who maybe needed it
even more than I did.</i>

50:19.143 --> 50:22.090
<i>I was disappointed, obviously...</i>

50:22.480 --> 50:25.620
<i>...but I'm honestly glad
that it's where it belongs.</i>

50:26.117 --> 50:27.994
<i>And I'm even glad
to have my disappointment...</i>

50:29.120 --> 50:31.691
<i>...which is much better
than having nothing.</i>

50:33.424 --> 50:38.373
<i>My dad told me that New York once had
a Sixth Borough that ﬂoated away.</i>

50:38.629 --> 50:41.439
<i>They tried to save it,
but they couldn't...</i>

50:41.666 --> 50:43.942
<i>...and it's never coming back.</i>

50:44.769 --> 50:46.874
<i>As much as I want him to...</i>

50:47.371 --> 50:50.147
<i>...my dad is never coming back.</i>

50:50.541 --> 50:55.183
<i>And I thought I couldn't live
without him, but now I know I can.</i>

50:56.013 --> 50:58.721
<i>I think that would
make my dad proud...</i>

50:59.784 --> 51:02.060
<i>...which is all I ever wanted."</i>

51:44.295 --> 51:46.901
<i>I got the Renter's address
from Grandma...</i>

51:47.064 --> 51:51.604
<i>...and although I wanted to say, "You
selfish butthead," and, "Fukozowa you"...</i>

51:51.769 --> 51:52.804
<i>...I didn't.</i>

51:55.406 --> 51:57.477
<i>I asked him to come home.</i>

52:51.462 --> 52:53.703
<i>"Congratulations, Oskar.</i>

52:53.898 --> 52:57.675
<i>With unbelievable bravery,
and wisdom far beyond your years...</i>

52:57.902 --> 53:01.440
<i>you have solved
Reconnaissance Expedition Number Six.</i>

53:02.206 --> 53:05.949
<i>You have proven both the existence
of the Sixth Borough...</i>

53:06.110 --> 53:08.784
<i>...and your own excellence.</i>

53:09.547 --> 53:13.859
<i>Wherever they now are, the people
of the Sixth Borough celebrate you.</i>

53:14.552 --> 53:16.088
<i>And so do I.</i>

53:16.420 --> 53:18.593
<i>Now it's time to go home."</i>

54:22.186 --> 54:23.722
One...
