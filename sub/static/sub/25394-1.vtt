ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
tech pioneer Darius Tanz!

00:04.613 --> 00:06.049
LIAM: Sir, my name's Liam Cole.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.399
In 186 days, an asteroid's
gonna collide with Earth,

00:08.443 --> 00:10.532
and we're all gonna die.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.273
Previously onSalvation...

00:12.316 --> 00:14.188
HARRIS:
An asteroid, Samson,

00:14.231 --> 00:16.712
large enough to cause
an extinction-level event.

00:16.755 --> 00:19.106
So what is the plan?HARRIS: A gravity tractor.

00:19.149 --> 00:21.456
Oh, that would deflect
the asteroid using
gravitational pull.

00:21.499 --> 00:24.285
I'm sure you understand why
this needs to remain classified.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.156
If the public were
to find out...DARIUS: Of course.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.116
The asteroid's iron core-- we
didn't account for its density.

00:29.159 --> 00:31.118
The gravity tractor's mass
may not be great enough

00:31.161 --> 00:32.597
to move Samson off its course.

00:32.641 --> 00:35.035
Get a medic for the president!
Cameras off, now!

00:35.078 --> 00:37.385
Claire, you poisoned
a sitting president.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.778
Mackenzie was too weak.

00:39.822 --> 00:42.346
And now it seems, so are you,
which is why you have to die.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.959
MACKENZIE: I was poisoned
in an attempted coup

00:47.003 --> 00:48.396
led by Vice President Bennett.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.224
And it's only through
the heroic actions

00:50.267 --> 00:55.229
taken by a handful of patriots
that I am still here.

00:55.272 --> 00:56.665
GUARD:
Bennett has escaped.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.188
I repeat,
Monroe Bennett has escaped.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.494
BENNETT: You're familiar
with the group RE/SYST?

00:59.537 --> 01:01.365
An underground hacktivist group.

01:01.409 --> 01:04.064
Tess, she's being attacked.
This is RE/SYST.

01:04.107 --> 01:06.414
MAN: We are tracking
four Russian ICBMs.

01:06.457 --> 01:07.806
We're under attack.

01:07.850 --> 01:10.287
We can stay defensive,
or we can launch our own.

01:10.331 --> 01:13.029
AGENT: Get to the Ark bunker!
It's the only safe place.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.553
An ark

01:15.597 --> 01:17.294
DARIUS: The hangar is
fully equipped to sustain life

01:17.338 --> 01:20.036
for several years in the event
of a nuclear attack.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.646
Wait, you're not staying?No.

01:21.690 --> 01:24.519
I want to be with you.
I don't care where.

01:26.695 --> 01:28.000
Jillian, I need to tell
Darius something.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.480
What? You can't leave.
You'll be locked out.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.221
I'm sorry,
I've got to go.

01:32.831 --> 01:35.834
Darius! The iron core.

01:35.878 --> 01:38.707
I know what to do.
There's still hope.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.528

No, that's okay.

Well, it's over now.
You're here with me.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.025
Mm.

Something's on fire.

What's happening?

02:48.690 --> 02:51.736
I'm afraid we're out of time.

No. We did this

The iron core.
I know what to do.

03:31.776 --> 03:33.648
Magnets?

03:33.691 --> 03:36.216
LIAM: Yes. Look,
here's the idea.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.826
We reprogram
the gravity tractor's EmDrive,

03:37.869 --> 03:40.089
turn it into an electromagnet,

03:40.132 --> 03:42.178
which pulls the
asteroid off course.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.137
Voila, save planet Earth,
collect Nobel Prize.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.835
Your plan,
while clever,

03:46.878 --> 03:49.141
would require oscillating
the EmDrive between thrust

03:49.185 --> 03:50.621
and magnetism,
a delicate dance

03:50.665 --> 03:52.232
with zero margin for error.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.842
With 127 days left to go,

03:53.885 --> 03:55.322
that's a chance
we can't take.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.802
Potassium iodide.

03:57.846 --> 04:00.022
Protects the thyroid
from radioactive iodine

04:00.065 --> 04:01.806
if we're exposed
to nuclear fallout,

04:01.850 --> 04:03.721
which may or may not
happen in about...

04:05.549 --> 04:07.159
...12 minutes.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.077
Can't get any signal.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.644
Yeah, me either.

04:13.688 --> 04:16.038
How the hell are we supposed
to know what's going on outside?

04:16.081 --> 04:18.170
All right, people. People!

04:18.214 --> 04:20.434
Everyone! Everyone, listen up.

04:20.477 --> 04:22.784
We're all on edge.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.786
But like Darius said,
this facility

04:24.829 --> 04:27.310
is air-gapped and EM shielded.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.356
We won't be able
to get cell service

04:29.399 --> 04:31.009
or any outside
information for now.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.663
But I can assure you,

04:32.707 --> 04:36.537
this bunker will protect us
from any nuclear strike.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.321
And just how long are we
supposed to be down here?

04:38.365 --> 04:39.714
Could be 30 days.

04:39.757 --> 04:42.064
No, no, no.
I didn't sign up for that.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.849
I'm going to see my family.
I'm going to see them right now!

04:44.893 --> 04:46.721
Get out of the way.GRACE: Sir. Sir.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.549
This facility
is sealed.

04:48.592 --> 04:49.985
The elevator isn't
going anywhere.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.900
MAN: Hey, hey, come on!We've got to get out of here!

Stay back, stand back.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.435
Get off me! Get off me!

05:09.657 --> 05:11.615
What did you mean
when you said magnets?

05:11.659 --> 05:14.139
We build an electromagnetic
railgun to fire projectiles

05:14.183 --> 05:15.358
into the asteroid,

05:15.402 --> 05:17.795
nudging it off
its trajectory.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.014
Seriously?

05:19.057 --> 05:21.146
We already build railguns
for the Navy.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.192
To shoot targets
here on Earth.

05:23.235 --> 05:24.628
See? We're already
halfway there.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.630
All we have to do
is scale it up.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.632
Yeah, to the size
of Massachusetts.

05:28.676 --> 05:32.680
At least run the numbers on
my idea before you shut it down.

05:32.723 --> 05:35.291
What is this?A protective shield.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.380
Titanium cladding.

05:37.424 --> 05:40.949
We've just become a hermetically
sealed bomb shelter.

05:40.992 --> 05:44.126
We're safe in here, right?
From the nukes?

05:44.169 --> 05:46.650
I guess we're gonna find out.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.438
You all right, sir?

05:51.481 --> 05:53.353
No. I am not all right.

05:53.396 --> 05:56.051
I got a family up there,
two daughters and a wife,

05:56.094 --> 05:57.966
and a nuclear bomb
headed right this way.

I'm Grace.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.592
What do you do, Joe?

06:15.636 --> 06:17.159
I'm an electrician.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.335
I don't even
work for Tanz.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.338
How old are your daughters?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.821
12 and 18.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.867
I have an 18-year-old
daughter out there, too.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.043
We all have family
out there somewhere.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.002
But we needed to seek shelter,

06:34.045 --> 06:37.397
and this is the only thing we
can do right now, wait it out.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.270
MACKENZIE:
General,

06:41.313 --> 06:43.141
how long until we know if
the Interceptors are successful?

06:43.185 --> 06:45.143
30 seconds.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.363
Have we reached Russian
Defense Minister Toporov?

06:47.407 --> 06:50.235
Yes. Moscow is aware
that we are not retaliating.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.760

Switching to intercept detail.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.504
Two ICBMs have
been destroyed.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.073
One has made it
past our defenses.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.164
And the fourth?

07:06.208 --> 07:08.384
TECH:
I've lost telemetry,

07:08.428 --> 07:11.039
but NORAD radar tracking
reports one ICBM.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.519
Is this confirmed?

07:12.562 --> 07:15.435
One ICBM has entered
a low Earth orbit.

07:18.046 --> 07:21.876
One got through.
To where?

07:23.617 --> 07:26.010
We'll know any moment.

07:26.054 --> 07:29.927
I know some of you were prepared
to head up to Mars.

07:29.971 --> 07:34.062
And the rest of us,
we were just seeking refuge.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.239
Whatever the case,

07:37.282 --> 07:40.547
Darius has sealed this hangar
for our own protection.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.200
We'll know
within 24 hours

07:42.244 --> 07:43.854
if it's safe to go
back out there

07:43.898 --> 07:46.291
because he'll unlock those doors
if all is clear.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.859
In the meantime,

07:48.903 --> 07:51.122
there are food supplies

what you do in the next
ten seconds will determine

23:39.287 --> 23:41.855
whether you go to sleep tonight
in the comfort of your own bed,

23:41.898 --> 23:44.379
the discomfort of
a jail cell cot or worse.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.208
Your call.

23:55.825 --> 23:57.305
Why can't we move these?

23:57.348 --> 24:00.351
Civil defense protocol.

24:00.395 --> 24:03.093
This road is reserved
for evacuation of VIPs.

24:03.137 --> 24:06.793
Can we agree right now that,
as far as the eye can see,

24:06.836 --> 24:08.359
there are no VIPs?

24:10.666 --> 24:12.625
All right!

24:12.668 --> 24:14.148
One car a time!

24:14.191 --> 24:17.934
Move on through
in an orderly fashion.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.458
LIAM:
Are you completely insane?

24:19.501 --> 24:20.633
You could've been killed
out there.

24:20.676 --> 24:21.851
That was mere mortal's work.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.418
What we're about to do,
I'm afraid,

24:23.462 --> 24:24.985
requires superhero skills.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.466
LIAM: Tess could have done
a month's worth

24:27.509 --> 24:30.077
of analysis in minutes.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.949
The DoE's supercomputer,
it doesn't have the same juice.

24:32.993 --> 24:36.126
It could take us weeks
to go through every line of code

24:36.170 --> 24:37.476
to find some sort
of vulnerability.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.129
We don't have weeks
and we don't have Tess.

24:39.173 --> 24:41.610
RE/SYST found a backdoor
to hack those ICBMs.

24:41.654 --> 24:43.656
Let's just hope they didn't
lock the door behind them.

24:47.398 --> 24:49.618
Hey, how long will this go on?

24:49.662 --> 24:52.621
Until we solve the problem.

24:52.665 --> 24:56.103
No, I'm talking about the Ark.

24:56.146 --> 24:58.758
It's been three days.

24:58.801 --> 25:01.151
How long do you leave them
down there A month?

25:01.195 --> 25:04.459
Until it's safer up here
than it is down there.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.853
If we can do the unimaginable,

25:06.896 --> 25:08.681
we most definitely can nudge

25:08.724 --> 25:12.249
a space rock
a few degrees off course.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.513
And that's just one
of many incidents

25:14.556 --> 25:17.211
happening all over the country,
Madam President.

25:17.254 --> 25:19.300
There's a crisis of confidence
out there.

25:19.343 --> 25:21.041
The public has more faith
in Darius Tanz

25:21.084 --> 25:23.217
than they do
in their own government.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.958
RE/SYST is winning the PR war.

25:25.001 --> 25:26.481
They've destroyed
our credibility.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.875
No. We've destroyed
our credibility.

25:30.050 --> 25:33.227
We need to make a bold move
to restore it.

25:33.270 --> 25:36.883
To remedy the loss of faith,
we need to take a leap of faith.

25:36.926 --> 25:37.971
Madam President,
we just received

25:38.014 --> 25:39.189
this communiqué
from RE/SYST.

25:39.233 --> 25:41.235
Thank you.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.109
They've sent
their list of demands.

25:54.683 --> 25:57.338
Madam President,
what's going on?

25:57.381 --> 25:59.862
Is Tanz being invaded?

25:59.906 --> 26:02.430
In a manner of speaking, yes.

26:02.473 --> 26:05.215
We just received the demands
from RE/SYST.

26:05.259 --> 26:07.957
They're assembling their own
asteroid mitigation project

26:08.001 --> 26:10.133
with 30 scientists
from around the world

26:10.177 --> 26:14.529
to be convened
24 hours from right now.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.878
They've given a list of names.

26:15.922 --> 26:17.706
And I'm on it.

26:17.750 --> 26:18.968
No.

26:19.012 --> 26:21.884
But he is.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.234
Wh

26:24.278 --> 26:26.672
Y-You can't hand Liam
over to them.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.978
I'm afraid we don't have
much leverage right now.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.589
They're threatening
to bomb any country

26:30.632 --> 26:33.330
that doesn't turn over
the scientists on their list.

26:33.374 --> 26:35.202
Unfortunately that's not all.

26:36.899 --> 26:39.162
They're asking for Tanz
as their base of operations.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.208
Absolutely not.
Darius...

26:41.251 --> 26:42.905
No, I refuse!

26:44.951 --> 26:48.084
You can't negotiate
with terrorists.

26:48.128 --> 26:50.086
I signed the order
five minutes ago.

26:50.130 --> 26:53.089
Under the NSPD, I was given
the emergency power

26:53.133 --> 26:54.656
to nationalize Tanz Industries,

26:54.700 --> 26:56.963
and I had no alternative.

26:57.964 --> 27:00.836
Ah, this is insane.

27:00.880 --> 27:04.100
Now first Tess.
Now Liam and

27:05.493 --> 27:06.799
Well, they've taken away
all my power.

27:06.842 --> 27:09.497
I'm-I'm...
I'm essentially useless.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.804
Not to me.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.464
Me, vice president?

27:20.508 --> 27:21.944
You have lost your mind.

27:23.337 --> 27:25.034
I need someone above politics.

27:25.078 --> 27:29.169
An outsider.
A bona fide hero.

27:29.212 --> 27:32.651
That situation off K Street,
video's gone viral.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.696
Millions have
seen it already.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.785
None of that
qualifies me to be VP.

27:36.829 --> 27:39.135
People have been VP on far less.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.963
Presidents, too.

27:41.007 --> 27:44.227
I convened an emergency
session of Congress,

27:44.271 --> 27:46.577
and they have approved you
with a two-thirds majority.

27:46.621 --> 27:49.319
I didn't know you were
born in Philadelphia.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.365
Ah, my-my parents
were on holiday.

27:51.408 --> 27:54.673
My-my mother went
into labor prematurely.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.677
I can't give up Tanz.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.853
You will assemble
a team of scientists

28:00.896 --> 28:05.074
of your choosing and you will
oversee it from the West Wing.

28:05.118 --> 28:09.862
You will have every resource
imaginable and then some.

28:09.905 --> 28:13.517
We are on a knife's edge here.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.389
I need you, Darius.

28:20.350 --> 28:21.874
I, Darius Tanz,

28:21.917 --> 28:23.832
do solemnly swear
that I will support

28:23.876 --> 28:26.748
and defend the Constitution
of the United States.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.619
LIAM:
Uh, um, Darius?

28:31.753 --> 28:34.756
Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.541
DARIUS: Against all enemies,

28:37.585 --> 28:40.283
foreign and domestic.LIAM: Hey, Darius.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.373
Uh, I'm sorry
to interrupt.

28:43.417 --> 28:45.549
Excuse me.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.987
Uh, the air supply in the Ark
hangar has been compromised.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.553
Oxygen levels are
falling rapidly.

28:51.425 --> 28:53.862
You asked when it was time
to open up the Ark?

28:53.906 --> 28:55.168
The answer's now.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.083
Mr. Tanz?

28:57.126 --> 28:59.259
CHIEF JUSTICE:
Mr. Tanz!

28:59.302 --> 29:01.391
Are you going to finish
taking the oath?

29:01.435 --> 29:03.089
And I will faithfully discharge
the duties of the office

29:03.132 --> 29:04.917
on which I'm about to enter.
So help me God.

29:10.836 --> 29:13.403
Which brings us
to the here and now.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.101
You left us down there
for five days

29:15.144 --> 29:16.798
even though
the immediate threat was over?

29:16.842 --> 29:17.930
Immediate threat?

29:17.973 --> 29:20.149
Missiles are circling
as we speak.

29:20.193 --> 29:23.283
A man died down there.
Your Ark nearly killed us all.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.632
My Ark did no such thing.

29:24.675 --> 29:26.460
Th-This was sabotage,
pure and simple.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.810
Of course, I forgot.
You're Darius Tanz.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.420
It couldn't possibly
be your fault.

29:30.464 --> 29:32.814
W-Wait. Why would someone
sabotage the hangar?

29:32.858 --> 29:34.642
That would be
a suicide mission.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.470
Why, I have no idea,
but-but the nitrogen

29:36.513 --> 29:37.819
isn't stored on the rocket.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.429
It's kept in tanks
under the hangar.

29:39.473 --> 29:42.302
Someone had to intentionally
start the flow,

29:42.345 --> 29:44.260
open a specific valve.

29:44.304 --> 29:47.524
MACKENZIE:
Well, we are all met

29:47.568 --> 29:48.961
and caught up, I gather.

29:49.004 --> 29:51.180
Grace.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.660
Harris.

29:52.703 --> 29:55.141
Thank you for your
service to country.

29:55.184 --> 29:56.707
Dare I say, the situation

29:56.751 --> 29:59.319
has gotten even more complicated
since last we met.

29:59.362 --> 30:02.148
Among the many obstacles
we face now,

30:02.191 --> 30:04.454
Monroe Bennett and his men
have managed to escape,

30:04.498 --> 30:07.457
and there were
casualties.

30:07.501 --> 30:08.676
Now, he and Claire Rayburn,

30:08.719 --> 30:09.851
they're in the wind.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.288
And we need to find them.

30:12.332 --> 30:15.204
Madam President...

30:15.248 --> 30:17.293
Yes, Madam President,
finding Monroe Bennett

30:17.337 --> 30:19.469
and Claire Rayburn will
be my top priority.

30:19.513 --> 30:20.993
MACKENZIE:
Thank you.

30:21.036 --> 30:24.997
Grace, as my new
senior advisor,

30:25.040 --> 30:26.215
assuming you accept...

30:26.259 --> 30:27.826
I'd be honored.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.697
...I'd like you
to craft a speech

30:29.740 --> 30:32.047
for our vice president here.

30:32.091 --> 30:34.658
He's going to address the nation
for the first time,

30:34.702 --> 30:35.834
tonight.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.444
Of course.

30:37.487 --> 30:41.013
And I have less than 15 hours
to disarm RE/SYST's warhead

30:41.056 --> 30:43.842
before they take control
of the world's top scientists,

30:43.885 --> 30:45.408
Liam included.

30:45.452 --> 30:47.541
If you'll excuse me.

30:47.584 --> 30:52.024
Ms. Barrows, Mr. Secretary,
it is so good

30:52.067 --> 30:55.418
to have people back
whom I can trust.

31:03.644 --> 31:05.559
Where are you going?

31:05.602 --> 31:07.387
We have to
tell her. Them.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.215
Grace, you shot
the president's top aide,

31:09.258 --> 31:10.564
then disposed of her body.

31:10.607 --> 31:11.782
Yes, to save your life.

31:11.826 --> 31:13.001
We never called
the authorities.

31:13.045 --> 31:14.655
We were under
nuclear attack.

31:14.698 --> 31:16.178
Claire was a
traitor, Harris.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.180
But we can't prove
that, Grace.

31:18.224 --> 31:19.834
Come here.

31:23.838 --> 31:26.058
Listen, you need to hear me.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.929
There will be
an investigation of us

31:27.973 --> 31:29.409
and your father.

31:29.452 --> 31:31.454
That's the last thing
any of us needs.

31:31.498 --> 31:33.369
And if we tell
Mackenzie and Darius

31:33.413 --> 31:34.849
and-and they don't
take action...

31:34.893 --> 31:36.851
They're complicit in a cover-up.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.635
It could bring down
our whole government

31:38.679 --> 31:40.376
at the worst
possible time.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.510
Claire's dead.
She's not coming back.

31:43.553 --> 31:46.469
This is a Pandora's box
we need to leave locked.

31:50.952 --> 31:53.259
Harris Edwards.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.217
Yeah.

31:55.261 --> 31:57.437
DARIUS:
Where are we?

31:57.480 --> 31:59.918
Nowhere, Darius. I've gone
through source code for hours.

31:59.961 --> 32:02.355
Whatever door they went through
they sealed pretty tight.

32:02.398 --> 32:05.706
Well, we've got ten hours,
so it's not over till it's over.

32:09.318 --> 32:12.539
Don't even think about
leaving that chair.

32:12.582 --> 32:15.542
Jillian, you're in charge
of him and the chair.

32:15.585 --> 32:18.806
We're not giving you up
to RE/SYST without a fight.

32:29.077 --> 32:31.601
Anyone ever tell you
you're a loud writer?

32:31.645 --> 32:35.040
Well, technically a loud editor,
and  yes.

32:35.083 --> 32:40.306
Darius... is there anything
you want to say to me?

32:40.349 --> 32:43.309
The speech is good. It's good.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.398
Although, some of it's
a bit rigid.

32:45.441 --> 32:48.270
I-I'd like go off book here
and there if you don't mind.

32:48.314 --> 32:50.359
Not about the speech.

32:52.361 --> 32:55.799
I'm sorry. I thought the Ark
was the safest place for you.

32:55.843 --> 32:58.802
Oh, my God,
this isn't about the Ark.

32:58.846 --> 33:00.456
Then what, Grace?

33:03.068 --> 33:05.722
I poured my heart out

33:05.766 --> 33:08.203
on that hill to you.

33:08.247 --> 33:10.249
I mean, I thought we were...Grace.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.599
Don't say my name like that.

33:12.642 --> 33:15.906
Not if you don't mean it.

33:15.950 --> 33:18.648
Well, I don't know what I mean.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.522
Suddenly I'm vice president
of the United States.

33:22.565 --> 33:25.873
Mackenzie has thrust me into the
position of father figurehead.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.353
Meantime,
I'm supposed to disarm

33:27.396 --> 33:29.877
a nuclear warhead
and protect the fate of humanity

33:29.920 --> 33:31.705
without even breaking a sweat,

33:31.748 --> 33:34.925
and... you're wondering why
I can't be emotional right now?

33:34.969 --> 33:37.537
I-I can't be anything
right now, Grace.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.930
To anyone.

33:52.117 --> 33:55.990
I'll have the revisions done and
loaded into the teleprompter,

33:56.034 --> 33:58.688
Mr. Vice President.

34:03.519 --> 34:05.347
DARIUS:
It's Liam.

34:05.391 --> 34:08.568
Grace. He's
found a way in.

34:08.611 --> 34:10.570
Hey! Hey, I'm in.

34:10.613 --> 34:13.312
I'm in the logs.
Look at what they did.

34:13.355 --> 34:15.618
DARIUS: RE/SYST modified
the rocket's firmware

34:15.662 --> 34:18.099
to transfer control
from Russia to them.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.536
Exactly, but the radio frequency
they used is still active.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.886
Which means?

34:22.930 --> 34:25.672
We can take control back.

34:44.778 --> 34:47.781
Okay, that is it.Stop, Liam!

34:47.824 --> 34:49.217
It's a trap.

34:58.705 --> 34:59.880
Look.

34:59.923 --> 35:02.926
Right here.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.146
RE/SYST added something
to the firmware.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.713
A daemon.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.323
What does that do?

35:08.367 --> 35:10.325
Uh, it's like
a stealth security guard.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.327
It watches for
any changes in the code.

35:12.371 --> 35:13.720
And if it finds any?

35:13.763 --> 35:15.113
Are those GPS coordinates?

35:16.940 --> 35:19.726
New York,
Shanghai, Moscow.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.076
Oh.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.773
Well, RE/SYST left
the door open,

35:23.817 --> 35:25.732
but they rigged
the house to blow.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.951
Liam, you were
one keystroke away

35:27.995 --> 35:30.563
from detonating
13 nuclear bombs.

35:30.606 --> 35:33.957
So if we try to disarm
those missiles...

35:34.001 --> 35:37.265
Millions of people die.

35:37.309 --> 35:38.701
LIAM:
That's it.

35:38.745 --> 35:41.139
It's over. They got us.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.929
HARRIS:
As secretary of defense,

35:48.972 --> 35:51.758
I'd be remiss
if I didn't voice my objection.

35:51.801 --> 35:54.195
Darius Tanz is volatile,

35:54.239 --> 35:56.415
unpredictable
and listens to no one.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.808
Putting him in the number two
position during a crisis

35:58.852 --> 36:02.247
like this seems...

36:02.290 --> 36:05.424
for lack of a better word,
irresponsible.

36:05.467 --> 36:10.603
Well, you have your opinion,
and I have mine.

36:10.646 --> 36:13.519
And I'm on this side
of the desk.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.392
Fair enough.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.569
I just thought I'd mention it

36:20.613 --> 36:22.310
before he makes
his television debut.

36:22.354 --> 36:24.965
And this has nothing to do with
the fact that perhaps you think

36:25.008 --> 36:26.836
you're the man for the job?

36:29.274 --> 36:33.103
I know how things get done here,
and how they don't.

36:33.147 --> 36:35.845
And Mr. Tanz knows
how to get things done

36:35.889 --> 36:38.108
when no one else does.

36:40.154 --> 36:43.244
But if you're not able
to support my decisions,

36:43.288 --> 36:45.377
perhaps we should have
that discussion.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.379
No, we're good.

36:47.422 --> 36:50.251
As long as it's clear
from whom I take orders

36:50.295 --> 36:52.253
and from whom I don't.

37:08.182 --> 37:10.010
JILLIAN:
They, uh, they said

37:10.053 --> 37:11.446
that you wanted to see me?

37:11.490 --> 37:13.143
Yes. What are you doing
for the next 122 days?

37:13.187 --> 37:15.624
I have, um, no idea.

37:15.668 --> 37:18.758
Well, now you do.
You're hired.

37:18.801 --> 37:20.760
As?My assistant.

37:20.803 --> 37:21.804
Karissa's gone home to Miami.

37:21.848 --> 37:24.285
I-I need someone
I know and trust.

37:24.329 --> 37:27.157
Uh, yes, Darius.
I-I mean, um,

37:27.201 --> 37:29.116
i-it would be
an honor, um,

37:32.337 --> 37:33.947
It's been 12 hours,

37:33.990 --> 37:35.340
and I'm already
sick of that title.

37:35.383 --> 37:37.211
To you, I'm Darius. Here.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.996
I need everything
that's marked with that

37:40.040 --> 37:44.653
ready to go in my office.

37:44.697 --> 37:47.047
In the West Wing,
tomorrow.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.354
One more thing. You put together
profiles of everyone

37:49.397 --> 37:50.964
that was down in the hangar?

37:51.007 --> 37:52.487
Yes, I interviewed
them all personally.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.141
I have a list catalogued.

37:54.184 --> 37:56.491
Good. Because someone
on that list sabotaged the Ark,

37:56.535 --> 37:58.493
and we're gonna
find out who it was.

37:58.537 --> 38:01.235
Gentlemen.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.589
Don't worry, I'll be back.

38:12.115 --> 38:14.074
MACKENZIE: Ladies and gentlemen
of the press,

38:14.117 --> 38:19.732
the vice president of the
United States, Darius Tanz.

38:19.775 --> 38:21.516
[reporters murmuring,
cameras clicking]

38:24.954 --> 38:26.434
Good evening.

38:28.349 --> 38:30.917
Over the years,
I've made hundreds of speeches,

38:30.960 --> 38:33.136
but usually with the aid
of slick graphics

38:33.180 --> 38:36.575
depicting the future,
our shared future.

38:36.618 --> 38:39.839
But tonight, it's just me
without all the eye candy.

38:39.882 --> 38:42.145
I'm sorry, I can't stand
the formality of all this.

38:42.189 --> 38:43.451
Um...

38:43.495 --> 38:45.323
: What the
hell is he doing now?

38:45.366 --> 38:47.977
What he always does:
whatever the hell he wants.

38:48.021 --> 38:49.414
DARIUS:
C

38:49.457 --> 38:53.156
Do you mind if I just...
sit closer to you?

38:53.200 --> 38:54.593
Camera still sees me?

38:54.636 --> 38:57.944
Now, I'm no politician,
obviously,

38:57.987 --> 39:00.599
and no one's ever accused me
of being very politic.

39:01.904 --> 39:04.994
But I agreed
to be vice president--

39:05.038 --> 39:07.301
your vice president--
on one condition:

39:07.345 --> 39:09.129
that I would never
be a politician

39:09.172 --> 39:11.305
and that I would always be able

39:11.349 --> 39:14.221
to tell you
the unvarnished truth.

39:16.658 --> 39:20.532
And the truth is...

39:20.575 --> 39:22.360
it's a scary time,

39:22.403 --> 39:24.274
for all of us.

39:24.318 --> 39:27.147
But I assure you
that President Mackenzie

39:27.190 --> 39:28.757
has given me every resource

39:28.801 --> 39:31.543
at the government's disposal
to stop that asteroid.

39:34.023 --> 39:36.548
RE/SYST holds a threat
over our heads, that is true.

39:36.591 --> 39:40.900
But if we allow them to stop us
in our daily lives,

39:40.943 --> 39:42.510
then the terrorists win,

39:42.554 --> 39:46.079
and I for one
won't allow that to happen.

39:46.122 --> 39:49.561
Now, I promise you,
the American people,

39:49.604 --> 39:52.128
that I will solve
the problems of tomorrow.

39:52.172 --> 39:56.568
And in return, I ask you to be
the solution today.

39:56.611 --> 40:01.355
Regard your fellow human beings
with kindness.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.792
Continue with your daily lives.

40:03.836 --> 40:07.927
Panic and fear
never solved anything.

40:07.970 --> 40:11.452
In the words of the great FDR,

40:11.496 --> 40:16.065
"The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself."

40:16.109 --> 40:19.852
And I can tell you this:
I'm not afraid.

40:23.856 --> 40:27.207
We will not go gentle
into that good night.

40:27.250 --> 40:30.950
We will fight with every fiber
of our beings

40:30.993 --> 40:34.997
to preserve what is true
and dear to us:

40:35.041 --> 40:37.913
our fair planet Earth.

40:40.220 --> 40:44.398
And... perhaps
some of our dreams

40:44.442 --> 40:49.098
are on hold for the moment,
but make no mistake,

40:49.142 --> 40:52.188
