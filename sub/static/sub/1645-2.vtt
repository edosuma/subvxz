Sona's a one-way street.

What goes in

00:06.963 --> 00:08.399

00:08.443 --> 00:10.358
Since the riots of last year,
they left here us to rot.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.925
They figured we would just
destroy ourselves,

00:12.969 --> 00:14.492
but instead we've thrived.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.668
How about we work
together, you know,
help each other out?

00:16.712 --> 00:18.192
You're on your own.

00:18.235 --> 00:20.237
Get me out of this!
You want to know

00:20.281 --> 00:21.238
where she is, find a way

00:21.282 --> 00:22.805
to get me out of this!

00:22.848 --> 00:25.199

00:25.242 --> 00:27.157
We can assist you
should you ever decide,

00:27.201 --> 00:29.116
say, to break out of here.

00:29.159 --> 00:31.161
This conversation's over.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.249
We're trying to do this

00:44.261 --> 00:48.091
We have a lot
to discuss, Lincoln.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.310
Specifically, your brother.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.616
How are we coming
with the transfer?

00:51.660 --> 00:54.097
You got to stay.What are you talking about?

00:54.141 --> 00:56.143
Dad, I'm so sorry.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.709
They got me and Sara.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.537
LINCOLN:
You got a week to find
this Whistler guy.

00:59.581 --> 01:02.714
Otherwise, they, uh,
they both die.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.996
So where you from

Chicago.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.784
Michael Jordan.

01:30.742 --> 01:32.004
You meet him?

01:32.048 --> 01:34.094
It's a big city.

01:34.137 --> 01:37.140
[chuckling]:
Oh, yeah, big city.

01:37.184 --> 01:40.012
Thanks for saving me a spot.

01:40.056 --> 01:42.058
Hey!

01:42.102 --> 01:43.538
Forget it!

01:48.412 --> 01:50.980
You ever have sex with
blond cheerleader?

01:51.023 --> 01:52.764
Yeah, sure.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.158
You're the man, bro.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.203
How long's
the water been out?

01:56.246 --> 01:59.771
Since riots
last year.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.164
Government blame us.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.819
They say, "Screw you,
you break it."

02:03.862 --> 02:06.126
No water.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.740
Gracias.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.007
Real quick.

02:18.050 --> 02:20.183
There's an inmate here
named James Whistler.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.793
I'm looking for him.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.926
Welcome to club.

02:23.969 --> 02:25.145
Everybody looking for him.

02:25.188 --> 02:26.494
Why's that?

02:26.537 --> 02:29.366
He killed the mayor
of Panama City's son.

02:29.410 --> 02:30.889

So where is he now?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.508

02:51.258 --> 02:52.520
you know that?

02:52.563 --> 02:54.435
But then I see you
with this, huh?

02:54.478 --> 02:55.349
Life must be good, eh?

02:55.392 --> 02:58.352
Look, I'm-I'm hungry, okay?

02:58.395 --> 02:59.527
You worry about me
being hungry.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.214
There's gonna be more water.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.303
When?!

03:39.436 --> 03:42.352
I said there will
be more water.

Later, bro.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.716
Go.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.935
Go.

04:32.228 --> 04:34.361
Spare a little?

04:34.404 --> 04:35.797
I need some information.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.059
Absolutely.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.148
You slipped this note
in my pocket yesterday.

04:39.191 --> 04:40.976
Why?

04:41.019 --> 04:43.848
My memory's a little foggy
on account of this thirst.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.376
Yeah, it's starting
to come back to me now.

04:49.419 --> 04:50.899
A little more agua there.

04:50.942 --> 04:51.943
The note.

04:53.771 --> 04:55.773
This guy gave me some rat meat
in exchange for putting that

04:55.817 --> 04:58.341
in your pocket and the pocket of
the guy you were set to fight.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.560
Why?

04:59.603 --> 05:01.823
He's nuts, that's why.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.390
Anybody who can live down
in those sewers

05:03.433 --> 05:05.087
doesn't have all his faculties.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.002

My name is Michael Scofield.

06:06.757 --> 06:12.676
I was sent to get you
out of here.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.592
I'm going to assume
they told you I was coming.

06:15.636 --> 06:20.423
Or that someone was coming.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.730
Whistler.

06:26.037 --> 06:28.692
Last chance.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.868
I'm not coming down here again.

[Whistler coughs]

06:36.570 --> 06:39.268
You're here to get
me out of Sona.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.531
Are you surprised?

06:42.663 --> 06:44.447
It's just that it's gonna
be a bit difficult

06:44.491 --> 06:45.492
getting me out of this hole.

06:45.535 --> 06:48.320
Seeing as if I go above ground

06:48.364 --> 06:50.192
and another inmate spots me,

06:50.235 --> 06:52.412
I'm a dead man.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.882
[coughs]

07:27.925 --> 07:30.667
There's a, there's a slight
misunderstanding

07:30.711 --> 07:33.104
that I have with the mayor...

07:33.148 --> 07:35.672
You know what?
It's none of my business.

07:35.716 --> 07:38.588
I'll come back and get you
when the time is right.

07:38.632 --> 07:39.807
I may not make it that long.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.504
That's your problem, my friend.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.593
I've got problems of my own.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.639
So you work for these people?

07:45.682 --> 07:47.641
The ones that want me
out of Sona.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.164
Look, just stay put.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.079
As long as no one knows
you're here, you should be safe.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.950
I'll be back.Why do they want me

07:52.994 --> 07:55.083
out of here so badly--
can you at least tell me that?

07:55.126 --> 07:57.738
Is this the part where you
pretend you're innocent?

07:57.781 --> 07:59.217
Just a pawn in all this?

07:59.261 --> 08:02.569
If they told you anything
about me before you came here,

08:02.612 --> 08:04.788
you'd know that to be true.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.356
I just want to know
what they want with me.

08:07.399 --> 08:10.185
Stay put.

08:23.938 --> 08:26.680
In an effort to save some time,
I'm gonna have

08:26.723 --> 08:27.942
to insist that we just

08:27.985 --> 08:29.596
skip right past
all the threats I know

08:29.639 --> 08:31.772
you're prepared to layout.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.817
Should anything
happen to Sara to LJ,

08:33.861 --> 08:35.689
you will scour the Earth
and hunt me down

08:35.732 --> 08:37.255
and rip my heart
from my chest

08:37.299 --> 08:38.605

08:38.648 --> 08:41.433
I absolutely know how you feel,

08:41.477 --> 08:44.306
as would I, okay?

08:44.349 --> 08:46.308
So that's done.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.136
On to business.

get the message?

08:50.181 --> 08:53.358
Good. You and I will
meet here every day.

of the prior day's progress.

your cell phone, answer.

stupid questions.

LJ and Sara will be
traded for Whistler.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.941
Are we clear?

09:10.985 --> 09:14.728
I want a picture of my son
and Sara to prove they're alive.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.730
Fine. I can do that, next.

09:16.773 --> 09:17.905
Why us?

09:17.948 --> 09:19.602
I'll answer that question

09:19.646 --> 09:22.823
so we can put it to bed
and you can focus on your work.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.738
There's a political
spotlight on Whistler

09:24.781 --> 09:26.609
due to the nature
of his crime.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.350
Raids, bribes, what have you,

09:28.393 --> 09:29.830
are not an option.

done in a week.

And the crucifix?

13:35.945 --> 13:36.990
I ripped it off

13:37.033 --> 13:38.426
Maricruz before she ran.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.950
There was no phone in that dump,
so I knew you wouldn't

13:40.994 --> 13:42.256
be able to call
from the road to...

13:42.299 --> 13:45.999
to make sure I wasn't lying.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.914
I-I conned you.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.045
So...

13:49.089 --> 13:52.005
so Maricruz is...

13:52.048 --> 13:53.876
She's picking grapes.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.878
I have no idea.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.010
Now, just lower the barrel.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.186
Put the gun down.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.976
Now, I came clean with you
and helped you out,

14:07.020 --> 14:09.065
right, buddy?

14:09.109 --> 14:10.893
So you got
to return the favor.

14:10.937 --> 14:14.941
Call my mom in Joliet--
Edna Bellick.

14:14.984 --> 14:17.117
She's listed. Sucre?

14:17.160 --> 14:18.945
I never laid a hand on Maricruz.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.860
I would never do that!

14:20.903 --> 14:23.645
Sucre, help me, please!

14:23.688 --> 14:26.082
Sucre, help me!

14:26.126 --> 14:28.693
[voice breaking]:
Help me!

14:31.131 --> 14:33.089
[grunts in disgust]

14:36.963 --> 14:38.747
[muffled cough]

14:38.790 --> 14:40.662
Oh, man.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.013
[sniffles]

14:44.057 --> 14:46.494
[water sloshing]

14:59.333 --> 15:02.249
[inhales, holds breath]

15:05.992 --> 15:08.995
Oh.

15:09.038 --> 15:11.171
[Whistler coughs]

15:14.826 --> 15:16.828
[suppressed cough]

15:33.193 --> 15:35.499
Hey.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.110
Hey.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.894
You find Whistler?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.026
Yeah.

15:40.069 --> 15:42.245
What's his story?

15:42.289 --> 15:45.031
I don't know,
and maybe

15:45.074 --> 15:46.075
it's better
that way, huh?

15:46.119 --> 15:48.164
I just got

15:48.208 --> 15:49.165
to get him
out of here, right?

15:49.209 --> 15:50.384
Come on, man,
come on.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.995
We got to keep moving,
we got to keep moving.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.127
What's the next
play?

15:54.170 --> 15:55.389
Whistler got a note out

15:55.432 --> 15:57.695
on a dead
body yesterday.

15:57.739 --> 16:01.395
I don't know what it means
or who it's for.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.659
But we need all the
leverage we can get,

16:04.702 --> 16:06.748
and, uh...

16:06.791 --> 16:08.315
I need some money.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.579
[fence clinking]

16:11.622 --> 16:14.190
[man speaks Spanish
over P.A. speaker]

16:18.107 --> 16:20.109
No one's ever broken out
of this place before,

16:20.153 --> 16:22.851
let alone with a
week to plan it,

16:22.894 --> 16:25.158
so...

16:25.201 --> 16:30.032
you tell these people,
whoever it is that took Sara

16:30.076 --> 16:32.339
and my nephew...

16:32.382 --> 16:35.472
you tell them I get it,

16:35.516 --> 16:37.779
and I'm going
to do everything I can.

16:37.822 --> 16:41.217
I'm going to break this guy
out of here,

16:41.261 --> 16:43.176
or I'm going to die trying.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.265
And if it's
the latter,

16:45.308 --> 16:48.181
then that should count
for something, right?

16:48.224 --> 16:50.226
That's got to count
for something.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.054
You tell them that.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.273
I will.

16:53.316 --> 16:55.188
Tell them.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.277
I'd trade places
with you in a second.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.586
I know.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.940
Whistler?

17:14.120 --> 17:16.818
[water sloshing]

17:16.861 --> 17:18.602
[metal pipe clanging]

17:29.439 --> 17:31.398
MAHONE:
You're not safe here.

17:34.270 --> 17:37.099
I can take you someplace
that is.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.840
[muffled grunt]

17:41.712 --> 17:45.107
WHISTLER:
If you're here
to help me,

17:45.151 --> 17:48.284
then just leave me alone.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.420
Please.

18:12.743 --> 18:13.701
Sucre?

18:15.181 --> 18:16.225
Linc!
Hey, man.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.139
What are you doing here?

18:17.183 --> 18:19.185
What are you doing here?

18:19.228 --> 18:20.229
Michael's locked up.

18:20.273 --> 18:21.448
For what?

18:21.491 --> 18:23.276
I don't know.
I'm sorting it through.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.581
[sighs]
I could use
your help.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.931
We're in a... we're
in a bad spot.

18:26.975 --> 18:30.196
I feel for you, man, but, uh,
I'm done with bad spots, Linc.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.588
I'm going to go see Maricruz.

18:31.632 --> 18:32.763
I just talked
to my cousin Petey,

18:32.807 --> 18:34.635
and he told me
she's back over in Chicago.

18:34.678 --> 18:36.463
Hey, you're still wanted
in Chicago, remember?

18:36.506 --> 18:38.595
I'll figure something out.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.165
All right.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.341
If you change your
mind, I'm staying at
the Plaza del Sol.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.256
I won't. I'm-I'm out
of here, bro.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.779
I'm going to go see my girl.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.694
Listen to me. The innocent
people in your life--

18:50.738 --> 18:52.392
you got to keep them innocent--
if that means walking away

18:52.435 --> 18:55.960
from them, that's what
you got to do.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.399
Good luck, Linc.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.469
Have we had our laughs
with him yet?

19:26.513 --> 19:28.602
[Wyatt shouting in distance]He's useless, man.

19:28.645 --> 19:29.777
You want to get rid of him?

19:29.820 --> 19:32.214
Huh? Then you cut
the mango. Huh?

19:32.258 --> 19:33.346
You caused me

19:33.389 --> 19:35.261
a big, big problem
out there today!

19:35.304 --> 19:36.479
You understand that?

19:36.523 --> 19:38.220
Now there's
no more water.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.265
They'll live.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.962
[distant shouting]Oh, yeah?

19:41.005 --> 19:42.181
They'll live?

19:42.224 --> 19:44.139
Yeah? Well, go out
and tell them that, then.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.882
[Wyatt shouting
in distance]

19:49.405 --> 19:50.101
Teodoro!

19:55.411 --> 19:58.327
There's water here.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.068
Give each man a little, hey?

20:00.111 --> 20:01.678
At once.

20:07.031 --> 20:09.077
Hey, Lechero!

20:09.120 --> 20:12.036
Don't worry about us!

20:12.080 --> 20:13.647
We're fine!

20:13.690 --> 20:16.258
He may have ruled the streets

20:16.302 --> 20:18.217
out there,
but in here,

20:18.260 --> 20:20.175
he's just
like us.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.829
Just like us!

20:21.872 --> 20:22.569
Come out!

20:22.612 --> 20:24.266
What, are
you afraid?

20:24.310 --> 20:25.267
Come and
lean on it!

20:25.311 --> 20:26.355
Come on, man!

20:26.399 --> 20:27.356
Come on!
[clamoring]

20:27.400 --> 20:29.489
Lechero, come out.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.491
The American in his
underwear-- you seen him?

20:31.534 --> 20:32.666
[smacks lips]

20:42.241 --> 20:43.894
T-Bag.

20:43.938 --> 20:46.375
Boy, you're going
to be drinking your own urine

20:46.419 --> 20:48.464
before you get any of this.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.988
I just need to speak
to Señor Lechero, please?

20:51.032 --> 20:53.382
Why don't you do yourself
a favor-- scamper.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.036
But I got something.
Oh, yeah.

20:55.079 --> 20:58.039
You got yourself
the untouchable status.

20:58.082 --> 21:01.956
Get myself killed just talking
to your mangy ass.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.218
[panting]

21:03.262 --> 21:05.351
Andale.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.135
But I got information.

21:07.178 --> 21:10.051
Good information.

21:12.053 --> 21:14.316
[clanging]

21:14.360 --> 21:16.492
[grunting]

21:22.846 --> 21:25.545
Are you out of
your mind, huh?

21:25.588 --> 21:26.807
He's got info.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.417
Pick a... pick a kneecap, huh?

21:28.461 --> 21:31.028
BELLICK:
I got information!
I just want food and clothing.

21:31.072 --> 21:31.638
Patron, please.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.640
Hold on. Hold on!

21:35.772 --> 21:37.731
This better be
informative.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.994
Or it's your kneecap next.

21:41.865 --> 21:45.434
This morning, before that whole,
uh, water thing,

21:45.478 --> 21:47.610
I, I heard you
and the lads talking

21:47.654 --> 21:50.265
about that Whistler character,
how no one's found him.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.701
Well...

21:51.745 --> 21:53.486
I just want food and clothing...

21:53.529 --> 21:54.487
Just tell him, idiot!

21:54.530 --> 21:56.097
BELLICK:
There's a guy hiding

21:56.140 --> 21:57.185
down in the sewers.

21:57.228 --> 21:58.795
I-I figure he's hiding
from you, right,

21:58.839 --> 22:00.231
because you run
this place, right?

22:00.275 --> 22:02.364
And so I figured you'd want
to know everything

22:02.408 --> 22:03.147
that goes on here,
so...

22:03.191 --> 22:04.366
Fine, shut up.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.455
It just might be Whistler,
si, patron?

22:06.499 --> 22:08.109
¿Si?

22:14.420 --> 22:16.944
Is he Australian?

22:16.987 --> 22:18.815
Yeah.

22:18.859 --> 22:20.991
Yeah!

22:31.654 --> 22:35.092
Courtesy of the Lechero's
munificence.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.834
[clamoring]

22:37.878 --> 22:41.055
Y'all need
to back up a tad now.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.448
Hey.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.319
How long you been
in Sona?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.452
McGRADY:
Three years.

22:46.495 --> 22:48.236
How old are you?

22:48.279 --> 22:49.411
Seventeen.

22:49.455 --> 22:52.022
And as far as you know,

22:52.066 --> 22:53.894
no one's ever broken out
of this place except,

22:53.937 --> 22:56.940
uh... except maybe
this Whistler guy?

22:57.811 --> 23:00.988
You Americans ask a
lot of questions.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.395
[softly]:
Oh, no.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.135
What's wrong?

23:18.179 --> 23:19.485
Come on.
Please.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.095
Come on!
I have a family.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.444
S-So do I.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.881
Come on.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.275
Stop!

23:27.318 --> 23:29.408
Stop, okay?

23:29.451 --> 23:31.627
Just...

23:42.551 --> 23:45.685
He's coming with me.

23:53.649 --> 23:56.217
[water sloshing]

24:05.052 --> 24:08.098
Just back up,
Michael. Just...

24:11.014 --> 24:12.363
You don't actually think
that killing somebody

24:12.407 --> 24:14.757
is going to help you get out
of here, do you?

24:14.801 --> 24:16.977
That does seem pretty strange,
doesn't it?

24:17.020 --> 24:18.892
But this is
a really strange place,

24:18.935 --> 24:20.589
one I want to get out of.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.156
Then I'll help you.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.549
I'll testify for you,

24:23.592 --> 24:25.246
whatever it takes.
Wow.

24:25.289 --> 24:27.074
Wow, look at that halo

24:27.117 --> 24:28.597
that just appeared
above your head.

24:28.641 --> 24:29.903
It's amazing.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.513
I don't have a choice, Alex...What'd you tell me

24:31.557 --> 24:32.427
yesterday?

24:32.471 --> 24:33.341
What did you tell me
yesterday?

24:33.384 --> 24:35.517
Huh? "You're on your own, Alex."

24:35.561 --> 24:37.824
Back up. Back up!

24:39.390 --> 24:41.218
You...

24:41.262 --> 24:43.525
you don't want this.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.136
Let me help you, Alex.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.110
WYATT:
Hey, your majesty!

25:04.024 --> 25:05.547
WYATT:
Where are you hiding?!

25:05.591 --> 25:07.636
You got to shut him up.

25:07.680 --> 25:08.768
WYATT: Where are
you hiding?!

25:08.811 --> 25:10.639
I need this bolson
to call me back.

25:10.683 --> 25:11.945
I need to talk
to you.

25:11.988 --> 25:13.120
Don't ever
walk in here

25:13.163 --> 25:14.904
without being called!I'm sorry.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.253
But it's worth the breach
in etiquette.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.167
Is it now?

25:17.211 --> 25:18.647
I thought you could use my help.

25:18.691 --> 25:21.084
There are ways I can be
of assistance.

25:21.824 --> 25:24.435
Just take the bounty
off Whistler.

25:24.479 --> 25:26.525
[scoffing]:
No.

25:26.568 --> 25:27.569
Whistler don't mean

25:27.613 --> 25:29.223
nothing to me, man.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.225
I have five consecutive life
sentences-- I ain't coming out

25:31.268 --> 25:32.748
of Sona no time soon.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.794
And why should I deprive
other men of chance at freedom?

25:34.837 --> 25:36.230
Huh?I need you to trust me.

25:36.273 --> 25:37.666
Oh.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.668
Trust you?

25:39.712 --> 25:41.757
[laughs]

25:41.801 --> 25:44.238
I don't know you good enough,
brother.

25:46.066 --> 25:47.546
Teodoro.

25:48.721 --> 25:50.549
Si, patron?

25:53.508 --> 25:56.337
[Lechero laughs]

25:57.381 --> 25:59.688
Can I trust this bobo?

25:59.732 --> 26:01.864
[sighs]

26:01.908 --> 26:04.171
He's a snake.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.651
He stabbed me

26:05.694 --> 26:09.611
in the back every chance he got.

26:09.655 --> 26:14.007
A snake who stab a man
in the back.

26:15.095 --> 26:17.750
I never hear
of such a creature before.

26:17.793 --> 26:19.752
[glass shattering]

26:19.795 --> 26:22.015
We got to stop this!

26:23.320 --> 26:24.147
[groans]

26:24.191 --> 26:25.584
Just give me two more minutes.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.411
Leave now!

26:27.455 --> 26:29.588
Leave!

26:29.631 --> 26:31.111
WYATT:
Crumbs!

26:31.154 --> 26:32.678
That's what you're giving us!

26:32.721 --> 26:34.549
Your crumbs!

26:34.593 --> 26:36.812
Hey, Lechero,

26:36.856 --> 26:38.205
how's your
television?

26:38.248 --> 26:40.990
[laughing]:
How's your whore?

26:41.034 --> 26:42.818
Come on,
what are you scared of?

26:42.862 --> 26:43.863
Hey.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.778
I need some, uh,
some moonshine.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.693
Moonshine?
Or some alcohol.

26:47.736 --> 26:48.824
Booze.

26:48.868 --> 26:49.869
Booze, yeah.

26:49.912 --> 26:50.957
I need it now.
A liter or a gallon--

26:51.000 --> 26:52.088
whatever you can get
your hands on.

26:52.132 --> 26:53.089
It's not good time
for party, bro.

26:53.133 --> 26:56.092
Bring it to me
in my cell.

27:41.529 --> 27:42.661
[baby cooing]

28:13.866 --> 28:16.172
Vámonos.

Come on, Whistler.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.880
[puts metal pipe down]

29:11.924 --> 29:13.752
Whistler, stop!

29:13.795 --> 29:14.840
Stop!

29:14.883 --> 29:16.885
What are you gonna...

29:16.929 --> 29:20.497
Whistler...

29:20.541 --> 29:22.108
[panting]

29:22.151 --> 29:24.240
Just come up
top with me.

29:24.284 --> 29:26.242
You got

29:26.286 --> 29:28.288
a better chance coming up
with me.

29:28.331 --> 29:30.507
At least you can plead your case
to Lechero.

29:30.551 --> 29:31.639
Just get...

29:31.682 --> 29:32.727
Go to hell.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.815
[hawking]

29:33.859 --> 29:35.034
Just...

29:35.077 --> 29:36.296
Go away.

29:36.339 --> 29:39.255
MEN [chanting]:
Lechero! Lechero!

29:43.042 --> 29:43.869
Not his best batch,
he say.

29:43.912 --> 29:45.827
It's fine.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.655
I'm going to need
some plastic bags.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.919
You didn't get it for to party,
did you?

29:50.963 --> 29:52.921
Plastic bags,
as many as you can get.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.402
I'll make it worth your while,
I promise.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.260
Gracias.

30:39.838 --> 30:40.882
Excuse me?

30:40.926 --> 30:42.101
You speak English?

30:42.144 --> 30:42.928
Yeah.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.016
We've met.

30:44.059 --> 30:46.583
I mean I saw you
yesterday at, uh,

30:46.627 --> 30:47.976
Sona.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.195
Yeah.
You know, uh,

30:49.238 --> 30:50.761
you can lose the whole
grieving widow thing.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.329
You're Whistler's
girl, right?

30:53.373 --> 30:55.114
I'm sorry, I have
to be somewhere.

30:55.157 --> 30:57.116
I just, uh, I got to
do something, all right?

30:57.159 --> 30:58.552
Do what?

30:58.595 --> 30:59.945
Give me that back

30:59.988 --> 31:01.033
or I'll call
the police.

31:01.076 --> 31:03.426
You're not going to
call the police.

31:07.039 --> 31:08.954
Why does he want this?

31:09.955 --> 31:11.957
I don't know.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.349
He's just a fisherman.

31:13.393 --> 31:15.134
A fisherman?

31:15.177 --> 31:16.962
Well, tell your fisherman
friend...

31:17.005 --> 31:20.443
tell your fisherman friend
Scofield's brother has this.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.186
Why won't you people

31:24.230 --> 31:25.492
just leave him
alone?!

31:27.146 --> 31:29.104
You think we want to
be forced into this?

31:29.148 --> 31:32.064
You think we want
to be here, lady?

31:32.107 --> 31:34.327
Forced into what?

31:35.067 --> 31:37.983
What are you talking about?

31:48.950 --> 31:50.734
All right,
hold this.

31:50.778 --> 31:52.084
Hold it.

31:52.127 --> 31:55.000
Watch the hallway
for me.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.004
I'm friends with
everybody here, bro.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.441
That's how I keep alive.

32:01.484 --> 32:04.618
You and I are friends, right?

32:04.661 --> 32:07.360
Yeah, but looks like
you got enemies.

32:10.580 --> 32:13.714
What I did for you,
getting you those
things...

32:15.150 --> 32:16.282
No one will ever know.

Back up! Back up.

32:42.134 --> 32:44.266
You can have him,

32:44.310 --> 32:47.226
but two of you will die
in the process.

Let me go down there.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.960
Let me cut just one throat.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.135
Just one.

They'll quiet down, man.

We just going
to sit up here,

What is it?

33:55.163 --> 33:57.165
Ran out of water.

33:57.209 --> 33:59.733
So, you mean
you've got a problem.

33:59.776 --> 34:01.952
Look, there was
an accident here.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.432
The tank tip over.

34:03.476 --> 34:05.130
My men need water, man.

34:05.173 --> 34:09.090
I'll see if I can get the water
truck there day after tomorrow.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.657
No, I need water now!

34:10.700 --> 34:12.615
I guess it's too bad
there's no guards

34:12.659 --> 34:14.095
in there anymore with you, huh?

34:14.139 --> 34:15.270
You could

34:15.314 --> 34:19.144
take hostages, have a riot,
make demands.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.102
Day after tomorrow.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.495
Lechero...!

34:22.538 --> 34:25.193
You call me and you raise
your voice at me like that

34:25.237 --> 34:27.195
again, you're not going

34:27.239 --> 34:29.328
to see water for two weeks.

You'll decide nothing.

You can't
deliver, Lechero.

What do we do?

37:22.283 --> 37:23.328
[exhales sharply]

37:26.548 --> 37:28.507
You've been outbid.

37:28.550 --> 37:31.336
Wait. What are
you talking about?

37:31.379 --> 37:32.119
What are you ta...?

talking...?

37:36.036 --> 37:37.167

37:37.211 --> 37:41.302
Now, that's, uh, very useful.

37:41.346 --> 37:44.218
Very useful.

37:47.961 --> 37:50.311
Whistler's clear?

37:50.355 --> 37:52.705
Yeah.

37:52.748 --> 37:56.491

Hello?

38:28.175 --> 38:30.133
Baby, it's me.

38:30.177 --> 38:31.439
Oh, my God.

38:31.483 --> 38:34.355
Oh, I... I've been so scared,
I've been praying

38:34.399 --> 38:35.487
every day.

38:35.530 --> 38:37.445
I did, too, babe.

38:37.489 --> 38:38.968
I just thank God you're okay.

38:39.012 --> 38:41.928
Petey called me
after he had talked to you,

38:41.971 --> 38:44.496
and he said that you might
be coming back here?

38:44.539 --> 38:45.584
That's what I told him.

38:45.627 --> 38:47.368
Yeah.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.414
You have to be so careful.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.459
Baby,

38:51.503 --> 38:54.157
I've been thinking, and, um,

38:54.201 --> 38:57.509
the only thing that I...

38:57.552 --> 38:58.858
that I care about right now

38:58.901 --> 39:01.861
is that you
and the baby are okay.

39:01.904 --> 39:05.038
That's all that matters to me.

39:06.387 --> 39:08.128
I'm not coming back.

39:08.171 --> 39:12.132
It's not because
I don't love you, because
you know I do--

39:12.175 --> 39:14.961
I love you more...
I love you more than anything--

39:15.004 --> 39:18.617
but... all I do
is bring you down.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.054
I'm no good for you.

39:21.097 --> 39:22.925
That's not true,
that's not true.

39:22.969 --> 39:26.407
Oh, it is, it is, it is, and...

39:26.451 --> 39:27.582
sometimes the only way

39:27.626 --> 39:29.410
to protect the people
that you love

39:29.454 --> 39:32.674
is... is by staying away
from them.

39:33.545 --> 39:36.635
One day,
when I get my life together--

39:36.678 --> 39:39.507
however long that takes--
I'll find you.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.074
I'll find you, and, uh,

39:41.117 --> 39:43.598
and I'll make you
and our baby proud.

39:43.642 --> 39:44.686
Te lo prometo.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.645
Te lo prometo, mi amor.

39:46.688 --> 39:48.951
I wish we could go back.

39:48.995 --> 39:54.217
I would give anything
to go back.

39:57.743 --> 40:00.136
I wish that, too.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.225
I wish that, too, baby.

40:02.269 --> 40:06.752
I love you so much, baby.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.103
I love you, too, baby.

40:16.196 --> 40:18.154
Good-bye.

40:18.198 --> 40:19.417
[crying]

40:19.460 --> 40:21.723
[quietly]:
Bye.

40:37.609 --> 40:39.480
You know, they told
me that your brother

40:39.524 --> 40:40.742
got all the brains,

40:40.786 --> 40:42.657
but I didn't realize
you were this stupid.

40:42.701 --> 40:44.442
What do you want, Susan?

40:44.485 --> 40:47.357
No sooner do I tell you
to stick to the plan,

40:47.401 --> 40:49.490
than you go and hassle
Whistler's girlfriend.

40:49.534 --> 40:50.709
You need to quit

40:50.752 --> 40:54.103
playing Sherlock Holmes
and leave her alone.

40:54.147 --> 40:54.713
Why?

40:54.756 --> 40:56.541
'Cause I said so.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.717
How about that?
All right.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.502
How about you beat it,
so I can get to work?

41:01.546 --> 41:02.764
I will,

41:02.808 --> 41:05.071
as soon as you give me
what you took from her.

41:05.114 --> 41:07.160
I took nothing from her.I got a gallon

41:07.203 --> 41:10.337
of bleach, a tarp and a hacksaw
in the trunk of my car.

41:10.380 --> 41:11.599
One hour, tops--

41:11.643 --> 41:13.949
you're off the face
of the earth.

41:16.561 --> 41:18.693
It's just a bird guide.

41:18.737 --> 41:22.044
I am not going to ask you again.

41:24.351 --> 41:25.874
[sighs]

41:25.918 --> 41:27.180
Toss it.

41:30.705 --> 41:32.185
Tomorrow-- bar.

41:32.228 --> 41:34.143
Progress report.
I will be waiting.

42:14.444 --> 42:16.577
[whimpering]

42:16.621 --> 42:19.319
[crying]

42:19.362 --> 42:22.670
So it's water you want.

42:22.714 --> 42:25.630
[crying]

42:25.673 --> 42:26.718
[gasping]

42:26.761 --> 42:28.415
Here's your water.

42:28.458 --> 42:29.764
[screaming]

42:29.808 --> 42:31.461
[water gurgling]

42:43.691 --> 42:45.432
[sighs]

42:45.475 --> 42:47.260
Thank you.

42:50.959 --> 42:55.050
So, how are we
getting out of here?

42:56.791 --> 42:59.185
I have no idea.
