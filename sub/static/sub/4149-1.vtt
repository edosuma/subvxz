They bust some serious shit.

46:41.548 --> 46:44.467
Those white boys are
more like busters on serious shit.

46:44.551 --> 46:45.968
I won't bump no Beasties.

46:46.053 --> 46:50.807

1:43:35.375 --> 1:43:37.793
This is my man right here.

1:43:37.878 --> 1:43:39.629
Where we headed, Rabbit?

1:43:39.671 --> 1:43:41.255
We're on our way.

1:43:41.298 --> 1:43:45.760
We're gonna get that big deal soon!
Then we'll get all the bitches!

1:43:45.802 --> 1:43:47.428
All the bitches.

1:43:50.349 --> 1:43:52.141
SOL: Where are we going?

1:43:52.226 --> 1:43:54.143
I'm going back to work.

1:43:54.353 --> 1:43:55.478
Work?

1:43:56.230 --> 1:43:59.148
Get out of here. You ain't going to work.

1:43:59.191 --> 1:44:01.275
You the man now. You ain't got to work.

1:44:01.318 --> 1:44:03.819
Fuck Wink! Fuck Tha Free World!

1:44:04.071 --> 1:44:05.905
We are the shit!

1:44:11.161 --> 1:44:12.328
What's up?

1:44:12.371 --> 1:44:13.621
Hold on.

1:44:14.081 --> 1:44:16.040
Man, I've been thinking.

1:44:16.917 --> 1:44:20.753
We should host the battles together,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1:44:23.548 --> 1:44:25.758
No. That's you, dawg.

1:44:27.052 --> 1:44:30.179
Come on.
Tell me you don't want to host with me.

1:44:30.847 --> 1:44:33.516
You'll have everybody looking up to you,

1:44:33.558 --> 1:44:35.810
everybody'll know who you are.

1:44:37.062 --> 1:44:38.479
Yeah, but...

1:44:39.898 --> 1:44:42.858
I think I need to just do my own thing, man.

1:44:45.737 --> 1:44:47.029
You know?

1:44:49.950 --> 1:44:52.118
Yeah, I think I do.

1:44:58.917 --> 1:45:01.377
(MELANCHOLY PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

1:45:09.928 --> 1:45:11.595
All right, Rabbit.

1:45:11.722 --> 1:45:13.389
Peace out, Rabbit!

1:45:29.448 --> 1:45:50.795
