00:29.310 --> 00:29.310
<i>Having reached the end
of my poor sinner's life...</i>

00:29.345 --> 00:32.080
<i>... I prepare to leave,
on this parchment, my testimony...</i>

00:32.247 --> 00:37.085
<i>... as to the wondrous and terrible
events that I witnessed in my youth...</i>

00:37.252 --> 00:43.091
<i>... towards the end of the year
of our Lord, 1327.</i>

00:43.258 --> 00:46.219
<i>May God grant me
the wisdom and grace...</i>

00:46.386 --> 00:50.139
<i>... to be the faithful chronicler
of the happenings that took place...</i>

00:50.306 --> 00:54.394
<i>... in a remote abbey
in the dark north of Italy.</i>

00:54.561 --> 00:59.190
<i>An abbey whose name
it seems even now...</i>

00:59.357 --> 01:03.111
<i>... pious and prudent to omit.</i>

03:35.471 --> 03:39.934
<i>May my hand not tremble
now that I start to relive the past...</i>

03:40.101 --> 03:44.189
<i>... and revive the feelings of uneasiness
that oppressed my heart...</i>

03:44.355 --> 03:47.192
<i>... as we entered the battlements.</i>

04:23.102 --> 04:26.064
Should we tell him?

04:27.482 --> 04:29.859
No.

04:30.026 --> 04:32.487
He will look in the wrong places.

04:32.654 --> 04:34.531
But...

04:34.697 --> 04:39.577
...what if he should learn it
of his own accord?

04:39.744 --> 04:43.790
You overestimate his talents,
my lord abbot.

04:43.957 --> 04:48.795
There is only one authority capable
of investigating such matters.

04:50.171 --> 04:53.591
The Holy Inquisition.

04:59.180 --> 05:03.226
What is your opinion,
Venerable Jorge?

05:04.978 --> 05:06.938
Dear brethren...

05:07.105 --> 05:11.442
...I leave such worldly matters
to younger men.

05:26.666 --> 05:28.668
Adso.

05:28.835 --> 05:31.588
Yes, master?
In order to command nature...

05:31.754 --> 05:35.049
...one must first learn to obey it.

05:35.592 --> 05:38.761
Return to the forecourts,
get the edificium on your left...

05:38.928 --> 05:42.765
...enter the quadrangle on your right,
you'll find the place you need.

05:42.932 --> 05:45.059
Behind the third arch.

05:53.902 --> 05:56.696
But you told me
you'd never been to this abbey.

05:56.863 --> 06:01.117
When we arrived, I saw a brother
making for the spot in some haste.

06:01.284 --> 06:04.370
I noticed, however,
that he emerged more slowly...

06:04.537 --> 06:07.665
...with an air of contentment.

06:09.709 --> 06:12.629
Thank you, master.

06:52.669 --> 06:56.756
On behalf of the Benedictine
order, I am honored to welcome you...

06:56.923 --> 07:01.553
...and your Franciscan brothers
to our abbey.

07:09.227 --> 07:13.064
The other delegates,
they have arrived?

07:13.231 --> 07:16.943
Ubertino de Casale
has been here for some weeks.

07:17.110 --> 07:20.029
The others are due tomorrow.

07:23.158 --> 07:27.704
You must be very tired
after your long journey.

07:27.871 --> 07:29.581
No.

07:29.747 --> 07:31.833
Not particularly.

07:33.042 --> 07:36.588
I trust you're not
in need of anything?

07:36.754 --> 07:39.215
No. Thank you.

07:39.382 --> 07:41.676
Well...

07:41.843 --> 07:46.014
Well, then I bid you peace.

07:50.727 --> 07:55.064
I'm sorry to see one of your brethren
has recently been gathered unto God.

08:03.781 --> 08:05.992
Yes, a terrible loss.

08:06.201 --> 08:09.370
Brother Adelmo was one of
our finest illuminators.

08:09.537 --> 08:12.040
- Not Adelmo of Otranto.
- You knew him?

08:12.207 --> 08:15.293
No, but I knew and admired his work.

08:15.460 --> 08:18.546
His humor and comic images...

08:18.713 --> 08:21.132
...were almost infamous.

08:21.299 --> 08:24.052
- But he was said to be a young man.
- Oh, yes.

08:24.219 --> 08:26.513
Yes, very young indeed.

08:27.180 --> 08:30.767
- An accident, no doubt?
- Yes.

08:30.934 --> 08:33.852
Yes, as you say, an accident.

08:35.647 --> 08:37.816
Well, that is, I...

08:44.197 --> 08:47.075
Brother William...

08:47.242 --> 08:49.744
...may I speak with you candidly?

08:49.911 --> 08:53.331
You seem most anxious to do so.

08:53.498 --> 08:55.917
When I heard you were
coming to our abbey...

08:56.084 --> 08:59.128
...I thought it was an answer
to my prayers.

08:59.295 --> 09:03.591
"Here," I said, "is a man who has
knowledge, both of the human spirit...

09:03.758 --> 09:06.594
...and of the wiles of the evil one."

09:07.136 --> 09:13.726
The fact is, Adelmo's death has caused
much spiritual unease among my flock.

09:16.563 --> 09:18.731
This is my novice, Adso...

09:18.898 --> 09:23.695
...the youngest son
of the Baron of Melk.

09:23.903 --> 09:27.073
Please do continue.

09:28.283 --> 09:30.952
We found the body
after a hailstorm...

09:31.119 --> 09:35.748
...horribly mutilated, dashed against
a rock at the foot of the tower...

09:35.915 --> 09:39.210
...under a window, which was...

09:39.419 --> 09:41.087
How shall I say this?

09:41.504 --> 09:44.090
- Which was...
- Which was found closed.

09:44.591 --> 09:48.052
- Somebody told you.
- Had it been found open...

09:48.219 --> 09:51.598
...you would have concluded
that he'd fallen.

09:51.973 --> 09:54.058
Brother William...

09:54.225 --> 09:57.437
...the window cannot be opened...

09:57.604 --> 09:59.689
...nor was the glass shattered...

10:00.064 --> 10:02.901
...nor is there any access
to the roof above.

10:03.067 --> 10:05.236
Oh, I see.

10:05.403 --> 10:08.198
And because you can offer
no natural explanation...

10:08.364 --> 10:13.578
...your monks suspect the presence of
a supernatural force within these walls.

10:13.745 --> 10:15.830
That's why I need the counsel...

10:15.997 --> 10:19.626
...of an acute man such as you,
Brother William.

10:19.792 --> 10:22.837
Acute in uncovering...

10:23.004 --> 10:25.840
...and prudent, if necessary...

10:26.007 --> 10:28.927
...in covering up...

10:29.093 --> 10:32.138
...before the papal delegates arrive.

10:32.305 --> 10:35.892
Surely you know, my lord,
I no longer deal in such matters.

10:36.059 --> 10:41.272
I am indeed reluctant to burden you
with my dilemma...

10:42.440 --> 10:46.027
...but unless I can put
the minds of my flock at rest...

10:46.194 --> 10:51.407
...I will have no alternative but to
summon the help of the Inquisition.

11:15.473 --> 11:18.017
Adso!

11:26.693 --> 11:29.737
That is Ubertino de Casale...

11:29.904 --> 11:34.200
...one of the great spiritual leaders
of our order.

11:34.534 --> 11:36.744
Come.

11:49.090 --> 11:52.010
Many revere him as a living saint...

11:52.177 --> 11:54.846
...but others would have him burned
as a heretic.

11:55.013 --> 11:59.225
His book on the poverty of the clergy
isn't favored reading in papal palaces.

11:59.392 --> 12:01.686
So now he lives in hiding
like an outlaw.

12:04.814 --> 12:08.109
Fellow Franciscans...

12:08.276 --> 12:13.573
...you must leave this place at once.

12:13.740 --> 12:17.160
The devil is roaming this abbey.

12:17.327 --> 12:19.078
Ubertino...

12:19.245 --> 12:21.789
...it's William.

12:21.956 --> 12:25.043
William of Baskerville.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.795
William...?

12:27.962 --> 12:30.840
No.

12:31.007 --> 12:33.760
No.

12:33.927 --> 12:37.555
William is dead.

12:46.231 --> 12:49.776
William, my son...

12:49.943 --> 12:51.820
...forgive me.

12:52.278 --> 12:56.866
We had lost trace of you for so long.

12:57.033 --> 12:59.994
I tried very hard to be forgotten.

13:00.328 --> 13:02.539
When we heard of your troubles...

13:02.705 --> 13:06.167
...I prayed to our virgin
for a miracle.

13:06.543 --> 13:10.797
Then your prayers met
with a favorable response.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.675
This is my young novice,
Adso of Melk.

13:13.883 --> 13:18.388
His father has entrusted me
with his education and welfare.

13:21.933 --> 13:23.685
You must get him out of here!

13:23.852 --> 13:28.731
Have you not heard, the devil is
hurling beautiful boys out of windows?

13:32.569 --> 13:35.822
There was something...

13:35.989 --> 13:38.283
...feminine...

13:38.449 --> 13:42.495
...something diabolical...

13:42.662 --> 13:46.040
...about the young one who died.

13:46.207 --> 13:50.587
He had the eyes of a girl...

13:50.753 --> 13:55.425
...seeking intercourse with the devil.

13:56.843 --> 13:58.928
Beware of this place.

13:59.512 --> 14:03.558
The beast is still among us.

14:03.725 --> 14:08.730
I can sense him now, here...

14:09.397 --> 14:13.067
...within these very walls.

14:13.234 --> 14:16.154
I'm afraid, William...

14:16.321 --> 14:19.032
...for you, for me...

14:19.199 --> 14:22.410
...for the outcome of this debate.

14:22.577 --> 14:25.747
Oh... My son.

14:25.914 --> 14:30.001
The times we live in.

14:32.253 --> 14:35.924
But let us not frighten...

14:36.090 --> 14:39.719
...our young friend here.

14:43.389 --> 14:46.810
She's beautiful, is she not?

14:49.103 --> 14:51.773
When the female...

14:51.940 --> 14:55.485
...by nature, so perverse...

14:55.652 --> 14:59.656
...becomes sublime by holiness...

14:59.823 --> 15:04.828
...then she can be
the noblest vehicle of grace.

15:07.038 --> 15:12.043
IN LATIN:

15:24.806 --> 15:28.059
- I don't like this place.
Really?

15:28.226 --> 15:32.564
I find it most stimulating. Come.

15:34.732 --> 15:37.569
Adso, we must not allow ourselves
to be influenced...

15:37.735 --> 15:40.905
...by irrational rumors
of the Antichrist.

15:41.072 --> 15:44.033
Let us instead exercise our brains...

15:44.200 --> 15:47.245
...and try to solve
this tantalizing conundrum.

15:49.789 --> 15:52.208
IN LATIN:

16:00.008 --> 16:03.011
<i>My master trusted Aristotle,
the Greek philosophers...</i>

16:03.178 --> 16:07.432
<i>... and the faculties of his own
remarkable, logical intelligence.</i>

16:07.599 --> 16:13.438
<i>Unhappily, my fears were not mere
phantoms of my youthful imagination.</i>

16:13.605 --> 16:18.109
A rather dark end
for such a brilliant illuminator.

16:35.835 --> 16:39.506
Another generous donation
by the church to the poor.

16:41.466 --> 16:44.385
Now, what if it wasn't that tower
that he fell from...

16:44.552 --> 16:49.891
...but somewhere over there, and then
the body rolled all the way down here?

16:50.141 --> 16:52.435
Adso?

16:53.770 --> 16:56.523
No devil needed anymore.

17:13.205 --> 17:16.334
Yes. More blood here.

17:16.792 --> 17:20.088
That's where he fell from.
He jumped.

17:23.174 --> 17:25.593
Adso, are you paying attention?

17:25.760 --> 17:28.805
Yes. He jumped.

17:29.264 --> 17:33.518
He jumped? You mean
that he committed suicide?

17:33.726 --> 17:37.772
Yes. Why else would someone
go up there at night in a hailstorm?

17:37.939 --> 17:42.569
- Certainly not to admire the landscape.
- No. Perhaps...

17:42.735 --> 17:44.487
Perhaps someone murdered him.

17:44.696 --> 17:47.824
And then toiled all the way
up there with the body?

17:47.991 --> 17:52.078
Easier to get rid of it through that
sluice gate they pour charity through.

17:52.245 --> 17:54.664
No, no. My dear Adso...

17:55.456 --> 17:58.293
...it's elementary.

18:01.421 --> 18:03.673
Suicide.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.842
Do you think that this...

18:06.009 --> 18:09.512
...is a place abandoned by God?

18:09.679 --> 18:14.434
Have you ever known a place
where God would have felt at home?

18:17.770 --> 18:20.732
<i>We praise almighty God...</i>

18:20.899 --> 18:26.237
...that there are no grounds for
suspecting an evil spirit among us...

18:26.404 --> 18:31.493
...either of this world or another.

18:32.243 --> 18:35.246
We praise our Lord that the debate...

18:35.413 --> 18:38.249
...which we are
so greatly honored to host...

18:39.209 --> 18:44.047
...may now proceed
without a shadow of fear.

18:46.633 --> 18:51.221
We also praise the Almighty for sending
Brother William of Baskerville...

18:51.387 --> 18:54.557
...whose experience
in previous duties...

18:54.724 --> 18:58.353
...although onerous to him...

18:58.561 --> 19:01.856
...has been of such service
to us here.

19:02.023 --> 19:05.693
May serenity and spiritual peace...

19:06.152 --> 19:11.199
...reign once more in our hearts.

19:30.176 --> 19:32.971
IN LATIN:

20:13.428 --> 20:15.972
Master?
Hmm?

20:20.935 --> 20:24.939
If I may ask, what...

20:25.106 --> 20:27.358
..."onerous duties"...

20:27.525 --> 20:30.445
...was the abbot talking about?

20:30.612 --> 20:33.364
Were you not always a monk?

20:33.531 --> 20:37.243
Even monks have pasts, Adso.

20:38.369 --> 20:40.371
Now, do try to sleep.

20:40.538 --> 20:42.832
I just...

20:43.917 --> 20:46.669
Yes, master.

20:51.925 --> 20:55.470
IN LATIN:

21:41.724 --> 21:43.726
The beast...

21:46.020 --> 21:48.106
The virgin...

24:14.544 --> 24:18.882
This one, I grant you,
did not commit suicide.

24:50.663 --> 24:53.124
- Water!
Here.

25:04.719 --> 25:06.596
I am to blame.

25:06.763 --> 25:10.266
Had I not been so eager to believe
your convenient explanation...

25:10.433 --> 25:12.310
...this might have been prevented.

25:12.477 --> 25:16.606
I am absolutely convinced
that Brother Adelmo took his own life.

25:16.815 --> 25:19.776
- Now, whether...
- Then the hail...

25:19.943 --> 25:24.697
Whether this death is connected
in any way with it, I intend to find...

25:24.906 --> 25:26.950
after the hailstorm...

25:27.116 --> 25:29.619
...with the second trumpet...

25:29.786 --> 25:34.290
...the sea became blood...

25:34.457 --> 25:37.043
...and behold...

25:37.210 --> 25:40.713
...here is blood.

25:40.880 --> 25:44.300
- The prophecy of the apocalypse!
- The third trumpet.

25:44.467 --> 25:47.679
A burning star...

25:47.846 --> 25:52.350
...will fall in fountains of water.

25:52.517 --> 25:55.812
Do not squander!
The last seven days!

26:10.910 --> 26:14.289
Grated stem of waterwort
for treating diarrhea.

26:14.455 --> 26:16.166
And as for onions...

26:16.332 --> 26:19.711
...administered in small quantities,
warm and moist...

26:19.878 --> 26:23.298
...they help prolong
the male erection...

26:23.464 --> 26:27.677
...in those who have not
taken our vows, naturally.

26:39.731 --> 26:41.900
Do you find many circumstances...

26:42.066 --> 26:46.488
...in which you apply arsenic,
Brother Severinus?

26:46.654 --> 26:51.701
Yes, indeed. It is a most effective
remedy for nervous disorders...

26:52.285 --> 26:54.829
...if taken as a compound
in small doses.

26:55.622 --> 26:58.666
And what of not-so-small doses?

27:00.460 --> 27:02.754
Death.

27:11.221 --> 27:14.098
What was this man's function here?

27:14.265 --> 27:17.227
He was our finest translator of Greek...

27:17.393 --> 27:20.438
...entirely devoted
to the works of Aristotle.

27:20.605 --> 27:23.608
Was he on friendly terms
with the handsome young Adelmo?

27:23.775 --> 27:27.278
Oh, indeed so. They worked together
in the scriptorium.

27:27.654 --> 27:32.116
But in a brotherly way,
you understand. Not like...

27:32.283 --> 27:36.454
I mean, flesh can be tempted
according to nature...

27:36.621 --> 27:39.249
...or against nature.

27:39.415 --> 27:41.960
And they were not
of the latter disposition...

27:42.126 --> 27:44.879
...if you ascertain my meaning.

28:54.407 --> 28:58.578
<i>Watch out for the dracul who cometh
in futurum to gnaw on your anima!</i>

29:18.807 --> 29:22.143
<i>Ugly con Salvatore, eh?</i>

29:23.436 --> 29:26.272
<i>My little brother, penitenziagite.</i>

29:28.316 --> 29:30.568
<i>"Penitenziagite."</i>

29:37.492 --> 29:40.119
<i>You said, "penitenziagite."
I heard you.</i>

30:12.277 --> 30:14.070
Master?

30:14.237 --> 30:16.781
What language was he speaking?

30:16.948 --> 30:21.035
All languages, and none.

30:21.202 --> 30:25.081
And what was the word
you both kept mentioning?

30:25.248 --> 30:27.876
<i>Penitenziagite.</i>

30:28.042 --> 30:32.005
- What does it mean?
- It means the hunchback, undoubtedly...

30:32.172 --> 30:34.799
...was once a heretic.

30:35.341 --> 30:39.304
<i>Penitenziagite was the rallying cry
of the Dolcinites.</i>

30:39.471 --> 30:42.724
Dolcinites? Who were they, master?

30:42.891 --> 30:45.727
Those who believed
in the poverty of Christ.

30:45.894 --> 30:47.896
So do we Franciscans.

30:48.062 --> 30:50.732
But they also declared
that everyone must be poor.

30:50.899 --> 30:53.943
So they slaughtered the rich.

30:56.279 --> 30:58.156
You see, Adso...

30:58.323 --> 31:02.535
...the step between ecstatic vision
and sinful frenzy...

31:02.702 --> 31:05.455
...is all too brief.

31:06.206 --> 31:10.960
Well, then, could he not
have killed the translator?

31:11.127 --> 31:14.380
No. No. Fat bishops
and wealthy priests...

31:14.547 --> 31:17.592
...were more to the taste
of the Dolcinites.

31:17.759 --> 31:20.512
Hardly a specialist of Aristotle.

31:20.678 --> 31:24.349
But, yes, you're right.
We must keep an open mind.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.437
Hmm...

31:30.522 --> 31:34.692
We are very fortunate to have
such snowy ground here.

31:34.859 --> 31:39.239
It's the parchment on which the criminal
unwittingly writes his autograph.

31:39.739 --> 31:43.034
Now, what do you read
from these footprints here?

31:43.243 --> 31:45.245
That they are...

31:45.411 --> 31:48.039
...twice as deep as the others.
- Good, Adso.

31:48.206 --> 31:50.959
And thus we may conclude...?

31:51.334 --> 31:54.128
- Well, that the man was very heavy.
- Precisely.

31:54.295 --> 31:57.423
And why was he very heavy?

31:58.466 --> 32:00.760
Because...

32:00.927 --> 32:04.556
...he was very fat?
- Or because he was being burdened...

32:04.722 --> 32:07.934
...with the weight of another man.

32:08.893 --> 32:12.480
Let us commit the autograph
of this sole...

32:12.689 --> 32:14.941
...to our memory.

32:16.442 --> 32:18.820
But the footprints
lead away from the jar...

32:18.987 --> 32:21.698
...in this direction.

32:21.865 --> 32:25.034
Oh, you turnip, Adso.
You're discounting the possibility...

32:25.201 --> 32:28.580
...that the man was walking backwards,
dragging the body thus...

32:28.872 --> 32:32.041
Hence, the furrows
created by the heels.

32:33.001 --> 32:35.837
Now, where did the erudite
Greek translator...

32:36.004 --> 32:39.799
...meet the anonymous author
of his death?

32:41.759 --> 32:43.761
Hmm?

33:08.995 --> 33:10.914
Brother librarian.

33:11.080 --> 33:16.044
Perhaps you will permit us to examine
the work of the two unfortunates...

33:16.211 --> 33:18.296
...so distressingly gathered unto God.

33:18.463 --> 33:21.341
Your request is most unusual.

33:21.508 --> 33:24.427
As are the circumstances
of their deaths.

33:32.060 --> 33:34.229
Brother Adelmo sat there.

33:34.395 --> 33:36.940
Thank you.

33:46.449 --> 33:49.494
IN LATIN:

33:58.878 --> 34:03.925
A donkey teaching the scriptures
to the bishops. Hmm.

34:05.844 --> 34:07.762
The pope is a fox.

34:08.972 --> 34:11.933
The abbot is a monkey.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.768
He really had a daring talent...

34:14.936 --> 34:17.563
...for comic images.

34:25.572 --> 34:29.367
<i>IN LA TIN:</i>

34:31.327 --> 34:34.789
I trust my words did not offend you,
Brother William...

34:34.956 --> 34:39.002
...but I heard persons laughing
at laughable things.

34:39.168 --> 34:43.089
You Franciscans, however,
belong to an order where merriment...

34:43.255 --> 34:46.092
...is viewed with indulgence.
- Yes, it's true.

34:46.259 --> 34:48.511
St. Francis was much disposed
to laughter.

34:48.678 --> 34:50.763
Laughter is a devilish wind...

34:50.929 --> 34:53.766
...which deforms the lineaments
of the face...

34:53.933 --> 34:56.393
...and makes men
look like monkeys.

34:56.561 --> 34:59.189
Monkeys do not laugh.

34:59.522 --> 35:02.233
Laughter is particular to man.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.110
As is sin.

35:04.277 --> 35:06.738
- Christ never laughed.
- Can we be so sure?

35:06.905 --> 35:09.991
There is nothing in the scriptures
to say that he did.

35:10.158 --> 35:12.660
Nothing in the scriptures
says that he did not.

35:12.827 --> 35:15.246
Even the saints have
employed comedy...

35:15.413 --> 35:18.249
...to ridicule the enemies of the faith.

35:18.416 --> 35:22.545
For example, when the pagans plunged
St. Maurus into the boiling water...

35:22.712 --> 35:27.634
...he complained his bath was too cold.
The sultan put his hand in, scalded it.

35:28.176 --> 35:33.973
A saint immersed in boiling water
does not play childish tricks.

35:34.140 --> 35:39.062
He restrains his cries
and suffers for the truth.

35:39.229 --> 35:42.899
<i>And yet, Aristotle devoted
his second book of Poetics...</i>

35:43.066 --> 35:47.403
...to comedy as an instrument of truth.

35:48.571 --> 35:51.157
- You have read this work?
- No, of course not.

35:51.324 --> 35:55.954
- It's been lost for many centuries.
- No, it has not. It was never written.

35:56.120 --> 36:00.458
Because providence doesn't want
futile things glorified.

36:00.625 --> 36:03.503
- Oh, that I must contest...
- Enough!

36:03.670 --> 36:06.339
This abbey's overshadowed by grief...

36:06.506 --> 36:11.469
...yet you would intrude
on our sorrow with idle banter!

36:12.887 --> 36:17.475
Forgive me, Venerable Jorge.
My remarks were truly out of place.

36:23.231 --> 36:27.026
- Which was the Greek translator's desk?
This one.

36:40.582 --> 36:42.125
Come, Adso.

36:53.219 --> 36:56.806
Well, Adso, what did you deduce
from that visit?

36:56.973 --> 36:59.851
That we are not meant
to laugh in there.

37:00.018 --> 37:04.731
But did you notice how few books
there were on the scriptorium shelves?

37:05.190 --> 37:10.487
All those scriveners, copyists,
translators, researchers, thinkers...

37:10.653 --> 37:14.491
But where are the multitude of books
that they need for their work?

37:14.657 --> 37:20.663
And for which this abbey is famed?
Where are the books?

37:22.874 --> 37:26.419
- Are you testing me, master?
- What do you mean?

37:27.378 --> 37:29.339
Well, with all due respect...

37:29.506 --> 37:34.260
...it seems that whenever you ask me
a question, you already have the answer.

37:35.637 --> 37:39.766
- Do you know where the books are?
- No.

37:40.892 --> 37:47.273
But I'll wager my faith that that tower
contains something other than air.

37:55.990 --> 37:59.828
Did you notice that little door
the librarian closed as we came in?

37:59.994 --> 38:02.872
Yes.
Could that lead to the library?

38:19.973 --> 38:23.560
Master! Master, quick!
I have him!

38:25.186 --> 38:29.524
Stop! Enough!
Master, he tried to kill us!

38:33.361 --> 38:34.612
Salvatore!

38:38.491 --> 38:43.454
Please, my lord, don't talk
to the abbot about his past.

38:43.621 --> 38:48.168
He's innocent of the deaths
in this abbey. I swear it.

38:50.170 --> 38:55.633
Brother, we need you.
My price is some information.

39:03.224 --> 39:06.895
<i>I could not comprehend why
my master so quickly dismissed...</i>

39:07.061 --> 39:10.190
<i>... my suspicions
of the heretical hunchback...</i>

39:10.356 --> 39:13.860
<i>... and why it was so urgent
that we visit the tower.</i>

39:14.027 --> 39:16.571
<i>I assumed he could not resist
the temptation...</i>

39:16.738 --> 39:20.533
<i>... to penetrate the library
and look at the books.</i>

40:37.986 --> 40:42.240
No lock. Just as I thought,
it must be bolted from the inside.

40:42.407 --> 40:43.950
How do we get in?

40:44.117 --> 40:47.328
Well, obviously, there must
be another entrance.

40:48.413 --> 40:51.332
Let us see what the moon-faced
assistant librarian...

40:51.499 --> 40:54.836
...was trying to conceal from us
this morning, shall we?

41:13.980 --> 41:18.318
Tiny Greek letters, perhaps
written by an ant with inky feet.

41:46.513 --> 41:48.389
Ah, yes.

41:51.726 --> 41:53.436
Written with lemon juice.

42:01.236 --> 42:02.821
Sagittarius.

42:02.987 --> 42:04.656
The sun.

42:04.948 --> 42:06.241
Mercury.

42:07.283 --> 42:09.035
Scorpio.

42:10.954 --> 42:17.293
It's some zodiacal code
giving directions, but to where?

42:19.295 --> 42:21.089
Hey! Who's there?

42:21.256 --> 42:22.799
Who's there?

42:43.194 --> 42:46.239
- My magnifying glasses!
They were on that book.

42:53.454 --> 42:55.206
You go that way.

44:00.605 --> 44:04.400
Come on out, you little bitch.

44:04.984 --> 44:09.364
I know you are here.
I can smell you.

44:14.202 --> 44:19.374
What's the matter with you, huh?
Are you afraid of me?

44:34.472 --> 44:36.432
Huh?

44:38.351 --> 44:40.562
I'll find you.

45:39.037 --> 45:40.788
<i>Who was she?</i>

45:40.955 --> 45:44.709
<i>Who was this creature
that rose like the dawn...</i>

45:44.876 --> 45:49.506
<i>... was bewitching as the moon,
radiant as the sun...</i>

45:49.672 --> 45:53.301
<i>... terrible as an army
poised for battle?</i>

49:16.921 --> 49:19.549
Good evening, Salvatore.

49:25.138 --> 49:28.016
This is where you catch them?

49:29.893 --> 49:34.147
<i>You see,
they are piu grasso. Bigger, eh?</i>

49:34.314 --> 49:35.732
You...

49:35.899 --> 49:37.650
You eat them?

49:39.194 --> 49:40.737
You like?

49:40.904 --> 49:43.114
Thank you, no. No.

49:47.243 --> 49:50.497
As you're a good Christian,
you must tell me this.

50:00.465 --> 50:04.928
So Adelmo gave the parchment
to Berengar.

50:05.094 --> 50:06.387
No, no.

50:06.554 --> 50:09.974
To the translo...
The transla...

50:10.141 --> 50:12.936
Translator!
Venantius, the black monk.

50:13.102 --> 50:16.564
- And what happened then?
- Then...

50:50.098 --> 50:53.560
Master! In here, quick.
I found another one.

51:02.527 --> 51:06.489
Where are your wits, boy?
Have you ever met anyone...

51:06.656 --> 51:12.245
...with a rib cage large enough to
accommodate a heart of that dimension?

51:12.412 --> 51:13.872
No.

51:14.747 --> 51:16.207
No.

51:16.499 --> 51:19.294
It is the heart of an ox.

51:20.420 --> 51:23.631
One of the monks probably gave it
to that peasant girl...

51:23.798 --> 51:26.801
...in exchange for her favors.

51:26.968 --> 51:29.304
Girl? Well, what...?

51:30.472 --> 51:33.975
The one I saw scuttling out of here.

51:35.894 --> 51:40.815
- He must have been a very ugly monk.
Why ugly?

51:43.693 --> 51:46.196
If he'd been young and beautiful...

51:46.362 --> 51:51.910
...she would no doubt have blessed him
with her carnal favors for nothing.

51:52.785 --> 51:56.456
In any event, whatever happened
in this dreadful kitchen...

51:56.623 --> 52:00.168
...has no bearing
on our investigations.

52:00.418 --> 52:04.547
Salvatore convinced me that Brother
Berengar, the assistant librarian...

52:04.714 --> 52:08.051
...is the key to the whole enigma.
What did you say?

52:08.426 --> 52:12.430
Nothing, master.
- Good.

52:28.571 --> 52:30.198
Master?

52:33.493 --> 52:36.287
There's something I must tell you.

52:37.580 --> 52:39.374
I know.

52:41.417 --> 52:44.337
Then will you hear my confession?

52:44.504 --> 52:49.843
Well, I'd rather you told me first
as a friend.

52:56.349 --> 52:58.101
Master.

52:59.853 --> 53:01.396
Have you...

53:01.980 --> 53:03.857
...ever been...

53:05.066 --> 53:06.776
...in love?

53:06.943 --> 53:10.905
In love? Yeah. Many times.

53:11.072 --> 53:14.075
- You were?
- Yes, of course.

53:14.242 --> 53:16.202
Aristotle, Ovid, Virgil...

53:16.369 --> 53:20.874
- No, no, no. I meant with a...
- Ah.

53:21.416 --> 53:25.879
Are you not confusing love with lust?

53:26.504 --> 53:28.047
Am I?

53:29.632 --> 53:31.509
I don't know.

53:32.760 --> 53:35.680
I want only her own good.

53:37.182 --> 53:39.642
I want her to be happy.

53:39.809 --> 53:42.937
I want to save her from her poverty.

53:44.439 --> 53:47.859
- Oh, dear.
- Why "oh, dear"?

53:48.026 --> 53:50.403
You are in love.

53:50.945 --> 53:52.864
Is that bad?

53:54.157 --> 53:57.952
For a monk,
it does present certain problems.

53:58.119 --> 54:01.915
But doesn't St. Thomas Aquinas
praise love above all other virtues?

54:02.081 --> 54:07.128
Yes. The love of God, Adso.
The love of God.

54:11.716 --> 54:14.761
And the love of woman?

54:14.928 --> 54:19.599
Of woman, Thomas Aquinas
knew precious little.

54:19.766 --> 54:22.227
But the scriptures are very clear.

54:22.393 --> 54:27.106
Proverbs warns us, "Woman takes
possession of a man's precious soul."

54:27.273 --> 54:33.363
While Ecclesiastes tells us,
"More bitter than death is woman."

54:35.073 --> 54:36.866
Yes, but...

54:37.617 --> 54:40.829
- What do you think, master?
- Well...

54:41.162 --> 54:46.334
Of course, I don't have
the benefit of your experience.

54:46.501 --> 54:49.671
But I find it difficult
to convince myself...

54:49.838 --> 54:55.385
...that God would have introduced
such a foul being into creation...

54:55.552 --> 55:00.974
...without endowing her
with some virtues. Hmm?

55:04.352 --> 55:08.231
How peaceful life would be
without love, Adso.

55:09.399 --> 55:11.192
How safe.

55:11.484 --> 55:13.278
How tranquil.

55:16.573 --> 55:18.199
And how dull.

55:32.088 --> 55:35.884
How beautiful.
Lord, you have guided our steps...

55:36.050 --> 55:38.928
...to this refuge of spiritual peace...

55:39.095 --> 55:43.516
...because you wish for reconciliation
as much as we Franciscans.

55:43.933 --> 55:48.104
- Let us go, brothers.
Thy will be done, O Lord.

55:48.271 --> 55:49.981
Amen. Amen.

55:52.233 --> 55:53.860
Brother Berengar?

56:00.742 --> 56:03.620
He's probably hiding somewhere...

56:04.454 --> 56:07.999
...with the book
and my magnifying glasses.

56:16.674 --> 56:18.760
Brother Berengar.

56:24.098 --> 56:26.726
Master, look. The door.

56:35.193 --> 56:36.236
Ah.

56:36.402 --> 56:41.199
Brother Malachia. I was just looking
for your assistant, Brother Berengar.

56:41.366 --> 56:43.785
- Is he here?
- No.

56:44.035 --> 56:46.079
Oh, I see.

56:46.287 --> 56:51.376
- Do you know where we might find him?
- No.

56:51.543 --> 56:56.506
- Is he perhaps upstairs in the library?
- No.

56:57.173 --> 56:59.676
I am curious to see
the library for myself.

56:59.843 --> 57:02.137
- May I do so?
- No.

57:03.513 --> 57:04.889
Why not?

57:05.056 --> 57:08.685
It is a strict rule of the abbot
that no one is permitted...

57:08.852 --> 57:13.731
...to enter the abbey library
other than myself and my assistant.

57:13.898 --> 57:15.608
I see.

57:16.109 --> 57:17.986
Thank you again.

57:30.707 --> 57:33.626
Maybe something's happened to him.

57:35.086 --> 57:38.673
- Maybe we'll find him in water.
- What?

57:38.840 --> 57:42.051
The third trumpet, master,
as Ubertino said.

57:42.218 --> 57:47.599
- The book of Revelation.
- That is not the book we're after.

57:55.607 --> 58:00.361
You call this chicken, do you?
It looks more like a sparrow.

58:14.459 --> 58:19.798
Welcome to our abbey, Brother Michele,
and to your fellow Franciscan delegates.

58:19.964 --> 58:24.928
<i>Hey, you, paesano! Go!
You get in line like the others. Go!</i>

58:25.094 --> 58:27.722
Unhand me!
- Salvatore, let him go.

58:27.889 --> 58:33.186
This is Cuthbert of Winchester, one of
our most esteemed Franciscan guests.

58:33.353 --> 58:36.689
Come, Your Grace. We have
a most urgent matter to discuss.

58:39.359 --> 58:41.861
The abbot and his colleagues
seem convinced...

58:42.028 --> 58:44.614
...that the devil is at work
within these walls.

58:44.781 --> 58:46.991
He is.

58:47.158 --> 58:50.370
The only evidence
I see of the devil...

58:50.537 --> 58:52.997
...is everyone's desire
to see him at work.

58:53.164 --> 58:55.583
What if Ubertino is right and you wrong?

58:55.750 --> 58:58.294
Don't forget this debate
is crucial to us all.

58:58.461 --> 59:00.672
We suspect the pope wants
to crush our order.

59:02.340 --> 59:04.217
Yes, and declare us all heretics.

59:04.384 --> 59:10.223
I only have one brother to question,
and the entire matter is resolved.

59:10.765 --> 59:14.477
William, we place our trust in you.

59:14.644 --> 59:17.897
Pray God you do not abuse it.

59:22.527 --> 59:24.320
Brother William.

01:00:06.821 --> 01:00:09.240
Did you find a book in Greek?

01:00:09.407 --> 01:00:10.658
No.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:26.049
I was right.

01:00:26.591 --> 01:00:29.511
So was the book of Revelation.

01:00:30.929 --> 01:00:34.599
- We must talk at once.
- Indeed, we must.

01:00:35.225 --> 01:00:37.811
And I have much to tell.

01:00:37.977 --> 01:00:41.523
Just as soon as he and I
have examined this corpse.

01:00:45.235 --> 01:00:48.655
Lime leaves in the bath are always
used to alleviate pain.

01:00:48.822 --> 01:00:51.699
- He was left-handed.
Yes, yes.

01:00:51.866 --> 01:00:54.786
Brother Berengar was inverted
in many ways.

01:00:54.953 --> 01:00:58.540
Are there other left-handed brothers
in the abbey here?

01:00:58.706 --> 01:01:00.750
None that I know of.

01:01:01.751 --> 01:01:03.503
Ink stains.

01:01:13.138 --> 01:01:16.391
He did not write with his tongue,
I presume.

01:01:25.817 --> 01:01:29.154
- A few lines of Greek.
Yes.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.865
Written by Venantius.

01:01:32.031 --> 01:01:37.495
Some random notes from the book
he was reading just before he died.

01:01:37.662 --> 01:01:41.458
Do you see how
the calligraphy changes?

01:01:41.958 --> 01:01:43.835
From this point on, he was dying.

01:01:44.002 --> 01:01:47.088
And what, my lord,
do you conclude from that?

01:01:48.756 --> 01:01:52.135
A smudge of blue paint.

01:01:52.719 --> 01:01:55.722
Yes, but a unique smudge of blue...

01:01:55.889 --> 01:01:59.017
...blended by your finest illuminator,
Brother Adelmo...

01:01:59.184 --> 01:02:01.895
...who possessed this parchment
before Venantius.

01:02:02.061 --> 01:02:05.064
And how do we know that?
Because those random notes...

01:02:05.231 --> 01:02:10.028
...overrun Adelmo's blue smudge,
and not vice versa.

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:17.160
Brother William, this abbey is
enshrouded in a terrifying mystery.

01:02:17.494 --> 01:02:21.456
Yet I detect nothing
in your obscure dissertation...

01:02:21.623 --> 01:02:24.834
...that sheds any light upon it.

01:02:27.086 --> 01:02:28.463
Light.

01:02:31.966 --> 01:02:38.348
Someone was at great pains to conceal
a secret of the first magnitude.

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:42.560
Now, the calligraphy is,
without question, left-handed.

01:02:42.727 --> 01:02:46.022
And the only left-handed member
of your community is...

01:02:46.189 --> 01:02:49.859
...or rather was, Brother Berengar,
the assistant librarian.

01:02:50.026 --> 01:02:55.740
Now, what kind of secret knowledge
would he have been privy to?

01:02:55.907 --> 01:02:58.785
I have the feeling that
you're about to tell me.

01:02:58.993 --> 01:03:01.454
Books. Restricted books.

01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:05.083
Spiritually dangerous books.

01:03:05.458 --> 01:03:09.629
Everyone here knew of the assistant
librarian's passion for handsome boys.

01:03:09.796 --> 01:03:13.675
<i>When the beautiful Adelmo wanted
to read such a forbidden book...</i>

01:03:13.842 --> 01:03:17.095
...Berengar offered Adelmo
the key to its whereabouts...

01:03:17.262 --> 01:03:20.348
...enciphered on that parchment...

01:03:20.515 --> 01:03:25.770
...in exchange for unnatural caresses.
- Enough, Brother William!

01:03:25.937 --> 01:03:30.275
Adelmo agreed and duly submitted
to Berengar's lustful advances.

01:03:30.441 --> 01:03:32.986
<i>Afterwards, wracked by remorse,
he wandered...</i>

01:03:33.153 --> 01:03:37.615
<i>... crying and desperate in the graveyard,
where he met the Greek translator.</i>

01:03:37.782 --> 01:03:40.869
- How could you know this?
- There was a witness.

01:03:41.035 --> 01:03:42.912
<i>The hunchback...</i>

01:03:43.246 --> 01:03:47.750
<i>... who saw Adelmo giving
this parchment to Venantius.</i>

01:03:48.251 --> 01:03:52.922
<i>Then running towards the small tower
and hurling himself out of the window.</i>

01:03:53.339 --> 01:03:57.051
<i>The night of my arrival, while
Berengar punished his sinful flesh...</i>

01:03:57.218 --> 01:04:00.847
<i>... Venantius, helped by the coded
instructions on the parchment...</i>

01:04:01.014 --> 01:04:04.976
<i>... made his way into the forbidden
library and found the book.</i>

01:04:05.143 --> 01:04:09.689
<i>He took it back to his desk
in the scriptorium and began to read it.</i>

01:04:09.856 --> 01:04:12.901
<i>After scribbling down
those few mysterious quotations...</i>

01:04:13.067 --> 01:04:15.945
<i>... he died with a black stain
on his finger.</i>

01:04:16.112 --> 01:04:19.657
<i>The assistant librarian
discovered the body...</i>

01:04:19.824 --> 01:04:24.996
<i>... and dragged it down to the pigpens
to avert suspicion falling on him.</i>

01:04:25.163 --> 01:04:28.166
<i>But he left his autograph behind.</i>

01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:31.085
<i>The book remained
on the translator's desk.</i>

01:04:31.252 --> 01:04:34.422
<i>Berengar returned there
last night and read it.</i>

01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:38.510
<i>Soon after, overcome
by some agonizing pain...</i>

01:04:38.676 --> 01:04:43.681
<i>... he tried to take a soothing bath
with lime leaves and drowned.</i>

01:04:44.265 --> 01:04:46.351
<i>He, too, had a blackened finger.</i>

01:04:46.518 --> 01:04:50.021
<i>All three died because
of a book which kills...</i>

01:04:50.188 --> 01:04:52.148
...or for which men will kill.

01:04:52.315 --> 01:04:56.903
I therefore urge you to grant me
access to the library.

01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:59.405
Brother William!

01:04:59.656 --> 01:05:02.742
Your pride blinds you.

01:05:03.576 --> 01:05:05.870
By idolizing reason...

01:05:06.037 --> 01:05:11.668
...you fail to see what is obvious
to everyone in this abbey.

01:05:13.837 --> 01:05:19.092
They have arrived, the papal delegation.
Bernardo Gui...

01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:29.102
Thank you, Brother William.

01:05:30.311 --> 01:05:34.190
We are mindful of your efforts...

01:05:34.357 --> 01:05:36.609
...but I should now ask you...

01:05:36.776 --> 01:05:41.197
...to refrain from
further investigations.

01:05:41.698 --> 01:05:47.787
Happily, there will be someone arriving
with the papal delegation...

01:05:49.038 --> 01:05:53.543
...who is well-versed in the wiles
of the evil one.

01:05:57.297 --> 01:06:02.093
A man, I believe, you know
only too well.

01:06:05.096 --> 01:06:06.514
Bernardo Gui...

01:06:08.099 --> 01:06:10.059
...of the Inquisition.

01:06:18.902 --> 01:06:20.570
Master.

01:06:20.945 --> 01:06:23.198
Who is Bernardo Gui?

01:06:24.199 --> 01:06:28.870
William! I've been searching
the entire abbey for you.

01:06:29.037 --> 01:06:32.290
Michele wishes to speak
with you at once.

01:06:33.208 --> 01:06:34.751
Alone.

01:06:35.502 --> 01:06:39.088
Do you know who is coming?
- I know, I know. Bernardo Gui.

01:06:39.255 --> 01:06:41.508
Ubertino must be moved
to a safe place.

01:06:41.674 --> 01:06:45.678
The arrangements have been made.
It is you that concerns us, William.

01:06:45.845 --> 01:06:49.474
You must now put aside these
totally irrelevant investigations.

01:06:49.641 --> 01:06:53.686
- And erroneous conclusions.
- It is the truth, and I am right.

01:06:53.853 --> 01:06:56.272
William is right.
William is always right!

01:06:56.439 --> 01:07:01.820
No matter what the consequences,
to himself or anyone else...

01:07:01.986 --> 01:07:07.700
...William of Baskerville
must always prove himself right.

01:07:07.867 --> 01:07:11.830
Was it not your vanity,
your stubborn intellectual pride...

01:07:11.996 --> 01:07:14.999
...that brought you into conflict
with Bernardo before?

01:07:15.166 --> 01:07:17.043
Do not tempt fate twice, William.

01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:21.756
Even the emperor won't be able to save
you if you tangle with Bernardo again.

01:07:36.604 --> 01:07:42.110
<i>My flesh had forgotten the sinful
pleasure that our union had given me...</i>

01:07:42.318 --> 01:07:45.238
<i>... but my soul could not forget her.</i>

01:07:49.617 --> 01:07:51.578
<i>And now...</i>

01:07:51.953 --> 01:07:55.915
<i>Now that I saw her in the midst
of her poverty and squalor...</i>

01:07:56.082 --> 01:07:59.252
<i>... I praised God in my heart
that I was a Franciscan.</i>

01:08:00.086 --> 01:08:04.507
<i>I wanted her to know that I did not
belong to this rapacious abbey...</i>

01:08:04.674 --> 01:08:10.180
<i>... but to an order dedicated to lifting her
people out of their physical destitution...</i>

01:08:14.267 --> 01:08:16.519
<i>... and spiritual deprivation.</i>

01:09:11.783 --> 01:09:14.077
Farewell, William.

01:09:14.828 --> 01:09:19.207
You are mad and arrogant...

01:09:19.374 --> 01:09:24.712
...but I love you and shall never cease
to pray for you.

01:09:26.631 --> 01:09:29.926
Goodbye, dear child.

01:09:31.719 --> 01:09:36.265
Try not to learn too many
bad examples from your master.

01:09:36.432 --> 01:09:39.018
He thinks too much.

01:09:39.185 --> 01:09:42.856
Relying always on the deductions
of his head...

01:09:43.022 --> 01:09:47.527
...instead of trusting
in the prophetic...

01:09:47.694 --> 01:09:52.657
...capacities of his heart.

01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:56.744
Learn to mortify your intelligence.

01:09:56.911 --> 01:10:00.957
Weep over the wounds of our Lord!

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.296
Oh. And do throw away those books!

01:10:06.504 --> 01:10:10.175
There is a side of Ubertino
that I truly envy.

01:10:10.341 --> 01:10:14.888
Remember, fear the last trumpet,
my friends.

01:10:15.054 --> 01:10:21.144
The next will fall from the sky,
and then will come 1000 scorpions.

01:10:21.311 --> 01:10:23.563
Yes, yes. We won't forget.

01:10:53.468 --> 01:10:56.179
Which one frightens you most?

01:10:58.056 --> 01:11:01.017
- They all do.
- No. Look closely.

01:11:08.233 --> 01:11:12.278
- That one.
- My choice exactly.

01:11:23.206 --> 01:11:25.208
Well...

01:11:32.799 --> 01:11:34.467
After you.

01:12:26.144 --> 01:12:31.232
Those are the foundations
of the tower.

01:12:38.448 --> 01:12:40.950
But how we reach the library...

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:47.165
The rats love parchment
even more than scholars do.

01:12:47.332 --> 01:12:49.250
Let's follow him.

01:12:54.881 --> 01:13:01.387
166. Bolted scriptorium door.
167, 168, 169, 170.

01:13:03.014 --> 01:13:07.101
317, 318...

01:13:10.814 --> 01:13:12.941
Oh...

01:13:13.107 --> 01:13:15.652
I knew it!

01:13:19.155 --> 01:13:23.034
Adso! I knew it!

01:13:47.725 --> 01:13:50.478
Adso, do you realize...

01:13:50.645 --> 01:13:55.567
...we're in one of the greatest libraries
in the whole of Christendom?

01:14:20.467 --> 01:14:22.927
How will we find the book
we're looking for?

01:14:23.094 --> 01:14:25.054
In time.

01:14:25.305 --> 01:14:29.934
<i>Oh... The Beatus of Liébana.</i>

01:14:30.143 --> 01:14:33.813
That, Adso, is a masterpiece.

01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:39.027
And this is the version annotated
by Umberto de Bologna.

01:14:39.194 --> 01:14:43.698
How many more rooms, huh?
How many more books?

01:14:48.661 --> 01:14:53.333
No one should be forbidden
to consult these books freely.

01:14:59.881 --> 01:15:04.803
Perhaps they are thought to be
too precious, too fragile.

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:07.889
No. It's not that, Adso.

01:15:08.056 --> 01:15:11.559
It's because they often contain
a wisdom different from ours...

01:15:11.726 --> 01:15:15.271
...and ideas that could
encourage us to doubt...

01:15:15.438 --> 01:15:18.900
...the infallibility
of the word of God.

01:15:27.992 --> 01:15:29.869
Master?

01:15:32.372 --> 01:15:36.960
And doubt, Adso,
is the enemy of faith.

01:15:38.753 --> 01:15:41.005
Master?

01:15:56.354 --> 01:15:58.648
Master?

01:15:58.815 --> 01:16:00.483
Master!

01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:02.819
Wait for me!

01:16:05.238 --> 01:16:07.782
But I am waiting for you.

01:16:13.204 --> 01:16:16.374
But I can hear you walking.

01:16:16.958 --> 01:16:20.378
I'm not walking, Adso.
I'm down here.

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:41.608
Is that you up there?

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.861
Where are you, boy?

01:16:46.237 --> 01:16:49.032
I'm lost!

01:17:09.886 --> 01:17:12.055
Well, Adso...

01:17:12.222 --> 01:17:15.642
...it would appear
that we're in a labyrinth.

01:17:27.946 --> 01:17:29.697
Are you still there?

01:17:29.864 --> 01:17:31.825
Yes.

01:17:31.991 --> 01:17:34.702
How will we get out?

01:17:34.869 --> 01:17:37.247
With some difficulty...

01:17:37.413 --> 01:17:39.707
...if at all.

01:17:39.874 --> 01:17:44.963
You see, Adso,
that is the charm of a labyrinth.

01:17:45.171 --> 01:17:47.715
Adso, stay calm.

01:17:47.882 --> 01:17:50.635
Open a book and read aloud.

01:17:50.844 --> 01:17:56.141
Leave the room you're in
and keep turning left.

01:17:56.307 --> 01:17:58.893
"Love does not originate
as an illness...

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.063
...but is transformed into it
when it becomes obsessive.

01:18:02.230 --> 01:18:04.732
The Muslim theologian
Ahmed Hasim states...

01:18:04.899 --> 01:18:07.986
...that the lovesick person does
not want to be healed...

01:18:08.153 --> 01:18:11.781
...and his dreams cause irregular
breathing and quicken the pulse.

01:18:11.948 --> 01:18:15.243
He identifies amorous melancholia
with lycanthropy...

01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:19.456
...a disease that induces
wolflike behavior in its victims.

01:18:19.622 --> 01:18:24.085
The lover's outward appearance
begins to change.

01:18:24.294 --> 01:18:27.547
Soon his eyesight fails,
his lips shrivel...

01:18:27.714 --> 01:18:30.675
...his face becomes covered
with pustules and scabs.

01:18:30.884 --> 01:18:34.804
Marks resembling the bites of a dog
appear on his face...

01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:38.766
...and he ends his days
by prowling graveyards...

01:18:38.933 --> 01:18:41.561
...at night...

01:18:41.728 --> 01:18:42.937
...like a wolf."

01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:46.566
Master, I can see a lantern.

01:18:46.733 --> 01:18:51.696
Don't move.
Stay where you are.

01:18:51.863 --> 01:18:54.991
I can see a man.
He stopped.

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.702
What is he doing?

01:18:57.869 --> 01:18:59.996
He's raising his lantern.

01:19:00.163 --> 01:19:02.832
How many times?

01:19:04.542 --> 01:19:06.586
Three times.

01:19:06.753 --> 01:19:09.172
It is I. Raise your lantern.

01:19:21.309 --> 01:19:22.769
Look! There!

01:19:29.984 --> 01:19:33.488
You foolish boy.

01:19:33.696 --> 01:19:36.032
It's only a mirror.

01:19:39.452 --> 01:19:41.287
Master!

01:19:42.997 --> 01:19:46.292
- The books, boy! Save the books!
- I'm trying to save you!

01:19:56.344 --> 01:19:59.222
A trap door and a mirror.
We must be almost there.

01:20:07.522 --> 01:20:10.567
If I have deciphered the instructions...

01:20:10.733 --> 01:20:13.194
...of the Greek translator correctly...

01:20:14.446 --> 01:20:16.614
You did not think me so foolish...

01:20:16.781 --> 01:20:20.535
...as to surrender our parchment
to the abbot without making a copy?

01:20:21.244 --> 01:20:27.500
<i>"Manus supra idolum, age primum
et septimus de quatuor" is what?</i>

01:20:32.839 --> 01:20:37.427
"With the hand above the idol...

01:20:37.594 --> 01:20:42.223
...press the first
and the seventh of four."

01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:43.766
Very good.

01:20:46.561 --> 01:20:47.729
What idol?

01:20:47.896 --> 01:20:50.190
That is what we're here to find out.

01:20:50.356 --> 01:20:52.817
And the first
and the seventh of four what?

01:20:52.984 --> 01:20:57.030
If I had the answers to everything,
I'd be teaching theology in Paris.

01:21:56.756 --> 01:21:59.217
And again.

01:22:04.806 --> 01:22:06.933
Do you hear that?

01:22:10.728 --> 01:22:13.022
- It's my teeth, master.
- What?

01:22:13.231 --> 01:22:14.941
My teeth.

01:22:15.108 --> 01:22:17.318
Don't be afraid.

01:22:17.902 --> 01:22:20.822
I'm not afraid. I'm cold.

01:22:21.448 --> 01:22:25.326
Oh. Well, we shall return.

01:22:25.493 --> 01:22:27.036
Don't leave on my account.

01:22:27.203 --> 01:22:32.083
No, no, no. I must confess,
it eludes me for the moment.

01:22:33.751 --> 01:22:36.296
Now, let me see...

01:22:36.463 --> 01:22:40.049
To find your way out
of the labyrinth...

01:22:41.134 --> 01:22:46.723
...when you come to a fork, you mark it
with an arrow... No, no, no. No.

01:22:48.349 --> 01:22:49.684
Master?

01:22:49.851 --> 01:22:51.936
Please, dear boy. I'm thinking.

01:22:52.103 --> 01:22:55.773
- lf there are arrows at the forks...
- Master!

01:23:02.947 --> 01:23:05.784
Well done, boy!

01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:10.121
Your classical education
serves us well.

01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:23.486
Thank you.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.784
Lucifer, be at my service.

01:25:24.506 --> 01:25:26.800
Lord Bernardo,
look what we found!

01:25:26.966 --> 01:25:28.802
Search the creature.

01:25:44.734 --> 01:25:49.572
My lord abbot, you invited me
to investigate the presence...

01:25:49.739 --> 01:25:52.492
...of the evil one in your abbey...

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.329
And I have already found it.

01:25:59.624 --> 01:26:03.670
How many times have I seen
these objects of devil worship:

01:26:03.837 --> 01:26:07.590
The black cockerel
and the black cat?

01:26:07.799 --> 01:26:10.301
But she did it for the food,
not the devil.

01:26:10.468 --> 01:26:14.347
William of Baskerville must
surely recall the trial he presided over...

01:26:15.348 --> 01:26:18.810
...in which a woman confessed
to having intercourse with a demon...

01:26:18.977 --> 01:26:20.603
...in the form of a black cat.

01:26:20.812 --> 01:26:24.524
I'm very sure that you don't have
to draw on my past experiences...

01:26:24.732 --> 01:26:28.027
...to formulate your conclusions,
Lord Bernardo.

01:26:28.194 --> 01:26:33.158
No, indeed. Not when faced
with such irrefutable evidence.

01:26:33.324 --> 01:26:37.912
A witch! A seduced monk!
Satanic rites!

01:26:38.079 --> 01:26:39.998
Tomorrow...

01:26:40.165 --> 01:26:43.251
...we endeavor to learn
if these events are connected...

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:46.796
...with the even graver mystery
that afflicts your abbey.

01:26:49.007 --> 01:26:53.386
Lock them up that we may all
sleep safely tonight.

01:27:04.689 --> 01:27:08.359
You said... You said nothing.

01:27:08.526 --> 01:27:10.987
I said nothing...

01:27:11.154 --> 01:27:13.364
...because there was
nothing to be said.

01:27:14.783 --> 01:27:17.202
You're ready enough
to speak the truth...

01:27:17.368 --> 01:27:20.789
...when it comes to books and ideas.

01:27:20.955 --> 01:27:23.458
She is already burnt flesh, Adso.

01:27:23.625 --> 01:27:27.045
Bernardo Gui has spoken.
She is a witch.

01:27:28.254 --> 01:27:31.299
But that's not true,
and you know it.

01:27:31.466 --> 01:27:33.635
I know.

01:27:34.594 --> 01:27:40.308
I also know that anyone who disputes
the verdict of an inquisitor...

01:27:40.475 --> 01:27:43.603
...is guilty of heresy.

01:27:46.356 --> 01:27:49.484
You seem to know a lot about it.

01:27:50.485 --> 01:27:53.029
Oh, yes.

01:27:56.533 --> 01:27:59.619
Won't you tell me...

01:28:01.162 --> 01:28:02.622
...as a friend?

01:28:03.373 --> 01:28:06.459
Well, there's not much to tell.

01:28:07.877 --> 01:28:10.046
I too was an inquisitor...

01:28:10.213 --> 01:28:15.844
...but in the early days, when
the Inquisition strove to guide...

01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:18.638
...not to punish.

01:28:19.722 --> 01:28:23.434
And once I had to preside
at the trial of a man...

01:28:24.519 --> 01:28:28.690
...whose only crime was to have
translated a Greek book...

01:28:28.857 --> 01:28:32.652
...that conflicted with
the holy scriptures.

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:39.284
Bernardo Gui wanted him
condemned as a heretic.

01:28:40.743 --> 01:28:43.705
I acquitted the man.

01:28:43.872 --> 01:28:50.295
Then Bernardo Gui accused me
of heresy for having defended him.

01:28:51.963 --> 01:28:54.507
I appealed to the pope.

01:28:55.675 --> 01:28:58.470
I was put in prison...

01:29:00.305 --> 01:29:02.765
...tortured...

01:29:09.772 --> 01:29:13.151
...and I recanted.

01:29:17.363 --> 01:29:19.741
What happened then?

01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:23.536
The man was burned at the stake.

01:29:24.329 --> 01:29:27.081
And I am still alive.

01:29:51.022 --> 01:29:53.149
Brother Salvatore...

01:29:55.819 --> 01:29:59.739
...these torments will cause me
as much pain as you.

01:30:04.327 --> 01:30:07.288
But you can put an end to them
before we even begin.

01:30:07.455 --> 01:30:11.960
Open the gates of your heart.
Search the depths of your soul.

01:30:12.127 --> 01:30:13.419
Search.

01:30:13.586 --> 01:30:15.088
I search!

01:30:16.923 --> 01:30:20.343
I search. I search.

01:30:21.136 --> 01:30:22.762
Then tell me...

01:30:24.514 --> 01:30:26.641
...who, among your brethren...

01:30:26.808 --> 01:30:30.812
...is the heretic responsible
for these murders?

01:30:44.826 --> 01:30:46.411
Me don't know nothing.

01:30:55.587 --> 01:31:00.633
<i>Did I lie awake that night
suffering for the girl or for myself?</i>

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.677
<i>I did not know.</i>

01:31:02.886 --> 01:31:06.014
<i>With the dawn
came the envoys of the pope...</i>

01:31:06.181 --> 01:31:10.101
<i>... our adversaries in
the forthcoming debate.</i>

01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:14.147
<i>But it meant so little to me now.</i>

01:31:37.253 --> 01:31:40.757
Your Eminence, venerable brothers...

01:31:40.924 --> 01:31:45.053
...at last we meet
for this long-awaited debate.

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:51.226
We have all journeyed great distances
in order to put an end to the dispute...

01:31:51.434 --> 01:31:57.607
...that has so gravely impaired
the unity of our Holy Mother Church.

01:31:58.441 --> 01:32:01.653
Good people throughout Christendom...

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:05.073
...are directing their gaze
at these venerable walls...

01:32:05.281 --> 01:32:09.661
...anxiously awaiting our answer
to the vexed question:

01:32:10.495 --> 01:32:12.872
Did Christ...

01:32:13.039 --> 01:32:15.375
...or did he not...

01:32:15.542 --> 01:32:18.753
...own the clothes that he wore?

01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:32.559
Beloved brethren
of the Franciscan order.

01:32:32.725 --> 01:32:39.441
Our Holy Father, the pope, has authorized
me and these, his faithful servants...

01:32:39.607 --> 01:32:42.402
...to speak on his behalf.

01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:46.573
The question is not
whether Christ was poor...

01:32:46.781 --> 01:32:51.870
...but whether the church
should be poor.

01:32:52.078 --> 01:32:57.542
You Franciscans wish to see the clergy
renounce its possessions...

01:32:57.750 --> 01:33:00.170
...and surrender its riches...

01:33:00.378 --> 01:33:03.465
...the abbeys dissipate
their sacred treasures...

01:33:03.631 --> 01:33:06.509
...and hand over their fertile acres
to the serfs...

01:33:06.676 --> 01:33:07.886
I found the book.

01:33:08.845 --> 01:33:10.472
I found it in the dispensary.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:14.517
A book in Greek was hidden
behind one of my jars.

01:33:14.726 --> 01:33:16.102
Don't touch it.

01:33:16.311 --> 01:33:18.688
Return. Lock yourself inside.

01:33:18.897 --> 01:33:21.566
I'll be there just as soon as I can.

01:33:21.775 --> 01:33:25.403
Thereby depriving
the church of the resources needed...

01:33:25.570 --> 01:33:30.909
...to combat unbelievers
and wage war on the infidel.

01:33:31.117 --> 01:33:35.705
You forget that even
the greatest monument to our Lord...

01:33:35.872 --> 01:33:41.252
...is but a pale reflection
of his infinite majesty and glory...

01:33:41.419 --> 01:33:44.881
...far outstripping the church...

01:35:23.104 --> 01:35:24.397
Quick, Father, quick.

01:35:24.564 --> 01:35:27.567
Salvatore has confessed
to his radical past, and yours.

01:35:27.734 --> 01:35:31.237
You have but little time
to escape the flames.

01:35:38.036 --> 01:35:39.704
Thank you, brother.

01:36:13.196 --> 01:36:17.033
Where are you going?
Let me go. I'm the cellarer.

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.243
Come with us!

01:36:18.451 --> 01:36:21.329
You call the pope's province
"God's palace on earth"?

01:36:21.538 --> 01:36:22.747
Answer that!

01:36:22.956 --> 01:36:24.958
They are a sign that reconciliation...

01:36:29.879 --> 01:36:33.883
The gospels state categorically
that Christ possessed a purse.

01:36:34.092 --> 01:36:35.635
That is a lie! You know it!

01:36:35.844 --> 01:36:39.639
The Lord commanded his disciples
on no less than seven occasions:

01:36:39.848 --> 01:36:43.893
- "Carry neither gold..."
- Venerable brothers!

01:36:49.566 --> 01:36:52.402
Brethren, if you please!

01:36:53.736 --> 01:36:56.823
A matter has occurred
of the utmost gravity.

01:36:56.990 --> 01:37:00.243
Let me go!
I swear, I didn't kill him!

01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:02.996
I was at the granary
taking the inventory!

01:37:03.163 --> 01:37:05.498
I never killed anyone!
I swear it!

01:37:05.665 --> 01:37:08.751
Then explain to us
the purpose of your escape.

01:37:10.628 --> 01:37:11.754
I was...

01:37:11.921 --> 01:37:14.966
I had already ordered
your arrest on other charges.

01:37:15.133 --> 01:37:17.927
I see now that I was correct.

01:37:18.761 --> 01:37:22.807
Had someone else not chosen
to look in the wrong direction...

01:37:22.974 --> 01:37:26.811
...several men of God
might still be with us.

01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:45.789
"To use vulgar persons.

01:37:45.955 --> 01:37:49.083
Take pleasure from their defects."

01:37:50.043 --> 01:37:52.754
Please, dear boy.
I am trying to think!

01:37:52.921 --> 01:37:56.257
So am I, master. So am I!

01:37:56.424 --> 01:37:59.385
Then try using your head
instead of your heart...

01:37:59.552 --> 01:38:01.513
...and we might make
some progress.

01:38:01.721 --> 01:38:04.599
A book's more important
than people to you?

01:38:04.766 --> 01:38:06.434
Did I say that they were?

01:38:06.601 --> 01:38:10.105
You never seem to care about anyone.

01:38:10.271 --> 01:38:12.774
Couldn't you at least show
a little pity?

01:38:17.654 --> 01:38:21.157
Perhaps that is the style
of my pity.

01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:26.121
But pity won't save her from the fire.

01:38:34.838 --> 01:38:40.635
I remind all present that they are bound
by their vow of obedience...

01:38:40.802 --> 01:38:43.304
...and on pain of excommunication...

01:38:43.513 --> 01:38:48.309
...to aid the inquisitor in his
painful struggle against heresy.

01:38:48.476 --> 01:38:51.521
To sit with me on this tribunal...

01:38:51.688 --> 01:38:54.441
...and to share
the burden of the verdict...

01:38:54.607 --> 01:39:01.281
...I will require the counsel
of two fellow judges.

01:39:12.208 --> 01:39:14.335
My lord abbot...

01:39:15.295 --> 01:39:17.589
...and...

01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:24.804
...Brother William of Baskerville.

01:40:02.675 --> 01:40:05.178
Salvatore.

01:40:06.846 --> 01:40:09.349
Salvatore.

01:40:14.062 --> 01:40:16.064
Salvatore...

01:40:16.231 --> 01:40:19.234
...will you repeat your confession
of last night?

01:40:20.443 --> 01:40:23.780
That you and your accomplice,
Remigio de Varagine...

01:40:23.988 --> 01:40:26.866
...were members of
the heretical Dolcinites?

01:40:36.376 --> 01:40:38.044
Thank you.

01:40:40.463 --> 01:40:42.632
Thank you.

01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:52.183
- You forgive me.
- Enough!

01:40:55.228 --> 01:41:00.859
Remigio de Varagine, do you deny
the confession of your accomplice?

01:41:03.695 --> 01:41:05.447
No.

01:41:05.613 --> 01:41:07.657
I don't deny it.

01:41:09.492 --> 01:41:12.620
I'm proud of it!

01:41:14.372 --> 01:41:17.500
For the 12 years I lived here...

01:41:17.667 --> 01:41:21.087
...I did nothing but stuff my belly...

01:41:21.254 --> 01:41:22.922
...shag my wick...

01:41:23.131 --> 01:41:27.135
...and squeeze the hungry peasants
for tithes.

01:41:27.343 --> 01:41:31.389
But now you have given me
the strength...

01:41:31.556 --> 01:41:36.478
...to remember what I once
believed in with all my heart...

01:41:36.644 --> 01:41:38.688
...and for that, I thank you.

01:41:38.897 --> 01:41:43.234
To remember that you wantonly looted
and burned the property of the church?

01:41:43.401 --> 01:41:46.237
Yes! To give it back to the people...

01:41:46.404 --> 01:41:48.907
...you stole it from in the first place.

01:41:49.073 --> 01:41:52.494
And did you not also slaughter
many bishops and priests?

01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:54.370
Yes!

01:41:54.537 --> 01:42:00.794
And I'd butcher you people
if I had half the chance!

01:42:07.801 --> 01:42:13.640
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
hear my humble prayer.

01:42:16.184 --> 01:42:19.771
I know that my sin
was very great...

01:42:20.605 --> 01:42:22.273
...but I beg of you...

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:26.486
...do not let her suffer
for my wrongdoing.

01:42:26.694 --> 01:42:28.655
Blessed Mother...

01:42:28.822 --> 01:42:33.743
...many years ago, you granted a miracle
by saving my master.

01:42:34.369 --> 01:42:38.081
Will you not do the same
for this girl?

01:42:39.749 --> 01:42:45.088
My master says that the simple folk
always pay for all.

01:42:46.131 --> 01:42:51.553
But please, Holy Mother,
do not let it be so.

01:42:53.471 --> 01:42:56.391
Guilty is that witch...

01:42:57.267 --> 01:43:00.562
...who has seduced a monk...

01:43:00.728 --> 01:43:04.941
...and has practiced her diabolical ritual
within this hallowed place.

01:43:07.527 --> 01:43:10.405
Guilty is Salvatore...

01:43:10.822 --> 01:43:13.408
...who has confessed
to his heretical past...

01:43:13.575 --> 01:43:17.245
...and was caught in flagrante delicto
with a witch!

01:43:17.454 --> 01:43:21.541
Guilty is Remigio de Varagine...

01:43:21.749 --> 01:43:24.961
...who, in addition to being
unrepentant of his heresies...

01:43:25.128 --> 01:43:28.673
...was caught attempting to escape
after murdering Severinus.

01:43:28.882 --> 01:43:30.175
That's a lie!

01:43:30.341 --> 01:43:34.012
I never killed the herbalist
or anyone else in this abbey!

01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:36.514
I therefore request you...

01:43:36.681 --> 01:43:40.435
...to confirm my sentence,
my lord abbot.

01:43:45.148 --> 01:43:49.068
My heart is filled with sorrow...

01:43:49.736 --> 01:43:52.822
...but I can find no reason
to contest...

01:43:52.989 --> 01:43:56.534
...the just sentence
of the Holy Inquisition.

01:43:58.328 --> 01:44:01.998
And you, William of Baskerville?

01:44:08.713 --> 01:44:10.340
Yes.

01:44:10.507 --> 01:44:12.425
He is guilty.

01:44:12.759 --> 01:44:15.428
Guilty of having, in his youth...

01:44:15.845 --> 01:44:19.307
...misinterpreted the message
of the gospels.

01:44:20.391 --> 01:44:24.562
And he is guilty of having confused...

01:44:24.729 --> 01:44:29.943
...the love of poverty with the blind
destruction of wealth and property.

01:44:32.529 --> 01:44:37.033
But, my lord abbot,
he is innocent of the crimes...

01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:39.828
...that have bathed your abbey
in blood.

01:44:42.330 --> 01:44:45.917
For Brother Remigio cannot read Greek.

01:44:46.126 --> 01:44:48.253
And this entire mystery...

01:44:48.419 --> 01:44:52.173
...hinges on the theft and possession
of a book written in Greek...

01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:55.009
...and hidden in some secret part
of the library.

01:44:56.261 --> 01:44:59.722
Since the verdict of
the Inquisition has been disputed...

01:44:59.889 --> 01:45:03.560
...we are obliged to extract
the prisoner's confession to murder.

01:45:03.768 --> 01:45:06.688
Take him to the forge
and show him the instruments.

01:45:08.064 --> 01:45:11.317
I'll confess anything you want...

01:45:11.526 --> 01:45:13.611
...but don't torture me.

01:45:13.778 --> 01:45:16.364
I can't live through it,
not like Salvatore.

01:45:16.531 --> 01:45:18.283
Very well.

01:45:18.616 --> 01:45:19.993
Why did you kill them?

01:45:21.953 --> 01:45:23.413
Why?

01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:27.542
I don't know why.

01:45:29.043 --> 01:45:32.464
- Because you were inspired by the devil?
- Yes.

01:45:32.630 --> 01:45:36.134
That's it. I was inspired
by the devil.

01:45:36.301 --> 01:45:40.555
I am inspired by the devil!

01:45:41.514 --> 01:45:46.728
Adrammelech, Lucifer,
I summon you, lords of hell!

01:45:46.936 --> 01:45:48.897
Alastor!

01:45:49.647 --> 01:45:51.065
Azazel!

01:45:52.650 --> 01:45:55.445
The shepherd has done his duty...

01:45:55.612 --> 01:46:00.325
...and the infected sheep must now
be consigned to the purifying flame.

01:46:00.492 --> 01:46:02.911
You may burn Brother Remigio...

01:46:03.119 --> 01:46:07.457
...but you will not stop the crimes
being committed in this abbey.

01:46:07.624 --> 01:46:10.084
Other monks will meet
their deaths here...

01:46:10.251 --> 01:46:13.129
...and they also will have
blackened fingers...

01:46:13.296 --> 01:46:15.006
...and blackened tongues!

01:46:16.257 --> 01:46:17.884
Your Eminence, I beg of you.

01:46:18.051 --> 01:46:21.221
We Franciscans are appalled
by Brother William's outburst.

01:46:21.429 --> 01:46:23.848
Again,
we have seen that your theories...

01:46:24.015 --> 01:46:26.184
...protect heretics and lead to murder.

01:46:26.392 --> 01:46:28.186
- The debate is concluded.
No.

01:46:28.353 --> 01:46:32.440
It seems Brother William
of Baskerville has relapsed...

01:46:33.441 --> 01:46:36.945
...into the errors of which
he was formerly purged.

01:46:37.112 --> 01:46:40.949
Having sought yet again
to shield a heretic...

01:46:41.116 --> 01:46:44.160
...from just punishment
by the Inquisition...

01:46:44.327 --> 01:46:48.081
...he will accompany me to Avignon
for confirmation of my sentence...

01:46:48.248 --> 01:46:50.375
...by His Holiness Pope John.

01:47:05.682 --> 01:47:07.434
I'm right.

01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:14.524
<i>If only I could find the book
and prove that Bernardo Gui was wrong.</i>

01:47:14.691 --> 01:47:18.611
<i>But the Antichrist was victorious
once more...</i>

01:47:18.778 --> 01:47:23.074
<i>... and nothing seemed to be able
to hinder him further.</i>

01:47:29.706 --> 01:47:32.167
Come.

01:48:01.696 --> 01:48:04.824
When the pyres are lighted tonight...

01:48:04.991 --> 01:48:10.997
...let the flames purify each of us
in his own heart.

01:48:11.206 --> 01:48:17.337
Let us return to what was and ever
should be the office of this abbey.

01:48:17.504 --> 01:48:19.964
The preservation of knowledge.

01:48:20.173 --> 01:48:25.720
"Preservation," I say,
not "search for."

01:48:25.929 --> 01:48:30.600
Because there is no progress
in the history of knowledge...

01:48:30.767 --> 01:48:36.064
...merely a continuous
and sublime recapitulation.

01:48:36.689 --> 01:48:39.442
Let us now praise the Almighty...

01:48:39.609 --> 01:48:44.197
...that the bloody-eyed
and cloven-hoofed Antichrist...

01:48:44.364 --> 01:48:48.409
...has been purged
from our sacred precincts...

01:48:48.576 --> 01:48:53.790
...and our monastery
has returned to peace.

01:49:03.258 --> 01:49:07.846
It had the power of 1000 scorpions!
He told me.

01:49:08.012 --> 01:49:10.014
Who told you? His tongue is black!

01:49:10.181 --> 01:49:12.100
His fingers as black as pitch...

01:49:12.308 --> 01:49:15.478
...just as Brother William foretold.
Adso!

01:49:29.242 --> 01:49:31.202
It's Brother Malachia.
- Malachia?

01:49:31.369 --> 01:49:33.872
- Yes, Father, yes.
- Dear God.

01:49:34.038 --> 01:49:36.040
Not Malachia!

01:49:36.541 --> 01:49:39.252
Will it never end?

01:49:39.878 --> 01:49:41.796
Malachia.

01:49:49.679 --> 01:49:52.307
Bernardo, William of Baskerville
was right.

01:49:52.515 --> 01:49:55.185
- He said that...
- Yes! He knew.

01:49:55.810 --> 01:49:59.522
Just as I, too, would have known,
had I been the murderer.

01:49:59.689 --> 01:50:01.983
Find William of Baskerville.

01:50:02.317 --> 01:50:03.902
We still can't open the mirror!

01:50:04.068 --> 01:50:07.405
Perhaps by pressing
the first and seventh letters of "four."

01:50:07.572 --> 01:50:09.949
"Four" only has four letters!
- In Latin.

01:50:10.116 --> 01:50:12.952
<i>Quatuor, remember?
The inscription above the mirror?</i>

01:50:13.119 --> 01:50:15.371
But we have to press above an idol.

01:50:15.538 --> 01:50:19.000
<i>Not "idolum," as in the Latin,
but "eidolon," as in the Greek.</i>

01:50:19.209 --> 01:50:23.296
Meaning "image" or "reflection."
Our reflection.

01:50:26.466 --> 01:50:30.136
This way, master.
- No, this way, Adso.

01:51:19.102 --> 01:51:21.646
Here, Q. Q and R.

01:51:22.814 --> 01:51:25.400
Pray God we're not mistaken.

01:51:36.369 --> 01:51:38.329
Come.

01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:06.608
Good evening, Venerable Jorge.

01:52:13.364 --> 01:52:18.036
I have been expecting you
these several days past, William.

01:52:18.244 --> 01:52:21.956
You must have flown to this chamber
to have reached it ahead of us.

01:52:22.123 --> 01:52:27.337
You have discovered many things
since your arrival at this abbey...

01:52:27.504 --> 01:52:32.550
...but the short route through
the labyrinth is not among them.

01:52:33.009 --> 01:52:36.805
So now, what is it that you want?

01:52:38.473 --> 01:52:42.811
I want to see the book in Greek
that you said was never written.

01:52:42.977 --> 01:52:46.189
A book entirely devoted to comedy...

01:52:46.356 --> 01:52:50.276
...which you hate as much
as you hate laughter.

01:52:52.153 --> 01:52:57.158
I want to see what is probably
the sole surviving copy...

01:52:57.992 --> 01:53:00.703
<i>...of the second book
of the Poetics of Aristotle.</i>

01:53:01.121 --> 01:53:07.377
William, what a magnificent
librarian you would have been.

01:53:08.044 --> 01:53:11.714
Here is your well-earned reward.

01:53:13.842 --> 01:53:15.343
Read it.

01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:18.096
Leaf through its secrets.

01:53:22.016 --> 01:53:24.060
You have won.

01:53:33.236 --> 01:53:34.487
Close, now!

01:53:52.505 --> 01:53:54.883
"We shall now discuss
the way comedy...

01:53:55.049 --> 01:53:57.343
...stimulates our delight
in the ridiculous...

01:53:57.510 --> 01:54:01.681
...by using vulgar persons
and taking pleasure from their defects."

01:54:04.642 --> 01:54:07.103
Carry on, William. Read it, read it!

01:54:07.437 --> 01:54:09.856
Master, please, we must hurry.

01:54:10.023 --> 01:54:12.150
If the light is too dim for you...

01:54:12.525 --> 01:54:15.028
...give it to the boy.
I'm sure he can read it.

01:54:15.236 --> 01:54:20.533
I would not want my faithful pupil
to turn your poisoned pages.

01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:25.163
Not without the protection of a glove,
such as I am wearing.

01:54:30.835 --> 01:54:33.880
The door, quick!
Before he shuts us in!

01:54:37.467 --> 01:54:39.344
Push!

01:54:45.308 --> 01:54:47.352
Stay, stay!

01:54:49.938 --> 01:54:51.106
Shh!

01:55:13.962 --> 01:55:18.716
Venerable brother, there are many
books that speak of comedy.

01:55:18.883 --> 01:55:21.761
Why does this one fill you
with such fear?

01:55:21.928 --> 01:55:26.015
Because it is by Aristotle.
- Adso, this way.

01:55:52.125 --> 01:55:56.171
Do you, Salvatore, renounce the devil
and embrace Jesus Christ...

01:55:56.379 --> 01:55:57.922
...as your lord and savior?

01:56:07.891 --> 01:56:10.727
Do you, Remigio de Varagine,
renounce the devil...

01:56:10.894 --> 01:56:13.396
...and embrace Jesus Christ...?
What for?

01:56:13.605 --> 01:56:18.193
It's better to die fast than to spend
the rest of your life in a prison!

01:56:18.401 --> 01:56:23.406
The devil I renounce is you,
Bernardo Gui!

01:56:27.869 --> 01:56:31.956
Do you renounce the devil
and embrace Jesus Christ as your savior?

01:56:37.712 --> 01:56:41.591
But what is so alarming about laughter?

01:56:41.758 --> 01:56:43.927
Laughter kills fear.

01:56:44.093 --> 01:56:47.138
And without fear,
there can be no faith.

01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:53.228
Because without fear of the devil,
there is no more need of God.

01:56:54.395 --> 01:56:59.109
But you will not eliminate
laughter by eliminating that book.

01:56:59.609 --> 01:57:02.195
No, to be sure.

01:57:02.403 --> 01:57:05.490
Laughter will remain
the common man's recreation.

01:57:05.657 --> 01:57:09.410
But what will happen if,
because of this book...

01:57:09.577 --> 01:57:15.792
...learned men were to pronounce it
permissible to laugh at everything?

01:57:15.959 --> 01:57:17.961
Can we laugh at God?

01:57:18.128 --> 01:57:21.923
The world would relapse into chaos.

01:57:22.132 --> 01:57:27.887
Therefore, I seal that
which was not to be said...

01:57:28.721 --> 01:57:31.474
...and the tomb I become.

01:57:36.813 --> 01:57:39.357
That's him!
He was there, behind the arch!

02:00:13.303 --> 02:00:14.637
Adso!

02:00:14.846 --> 02:00:16.055
Adso!

02:00:19.851 --> 02:00:21.102
Adso!

02:00:21.311 --> 02:00:24.272
- Master!
- Go on! I insist!

02:00:29.277 --> 02:00:31.988
Leave this place at once! I insist!

02:00:35.742 --> 02:00:38.369
Please, God, save him.

02:00:50.215 --> 02:00:51.633
Hold them back.

02:00:52.717 --> 02:00:54.594
Burn the witch!

02:01:01.059 --> 02:01:03.353
You dare raise your hands
to the church?

02:01:04.646 --> 02:01:06.106
Come!

02:02:23.892 --> 02:02:26.019
No! You're not going to leave!

02:02:26.227 --> 02:02:28.146
All of this is your doing!

02:02:28.354 --> 02:02:30.857
My master found the true murderer!

02:02:58.468 --> 02:03:00.178
Help me. Quick!

02:03:00.887 --> 02:03:02.388
Help me!

02:03:02.597 --> 02:03:04.891
Help me! No!

02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:07.143
No, no!

02:03:49.477 --> 02:03:51.813
Master.

02:03:52.856 --> 02:03:54.524
Adso!

02:07:01.961 --> 02:07:04.923
<i>I have never regretted my decision...</i>

02:07:05.089 --> 02:07:11.596
<i>... for I learned from my master much
that was wise and good and true.</i>

02:07:11.763 --> 02:07:15.767
<i>When at last we parted company,
he presented me with his eyeglasses.</i>

02:07:15.934 --> 02:07:20.355
<i>I was still young, he said,
but someday they would serve me well.</i>

02:07:20.522 --> 02:07:26.194
<i>And, in fact, I am wearing them now
on my nose as I write these lines.</i>

02:07:26.361 --> 02:07:32.075
<i>Then he embraced me fondly,
like a father, and sent me on my way.</i>

02:07:32.242 --> 02:07:35.787
<i>I never saw him again and know not
what became of him...</i>

02:07:35.954 --> 02:07:39.624
<i>... but I pray always that God
received his soul and forgave...</i>

02:07:39.791 --> 02:07:45.130
<i>... the many little vanities to which
he was driven by his intellectual pride.</i>

02:07:45.630 --> 02:07:50.552
<i>And yet, now that I am
an old, old man...</i>

02:07:50.718 --> 02:07:55.598
<i>... I must confess that of all the faces
that appear to me out of the past...</i>

02:07:55.765 --> 02:07:59.352
<i>... the one I see most clearly
is that of the girl...</i>

02:07:59.519 --> 02:08:05.984
<i>... of whom I've never ceased to dream
these many long years.</i>

02:08:06.151 --> 02:08:10.363
<i>She was the only earthly love
of my life...</i>

02:08:10.530 --> 02:08:15.702
<i>... yet I never knew nor ever learned...</i>

02:08:15.869 --> 02:08:17.328
<i>... her name.</i>
