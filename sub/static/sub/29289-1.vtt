              ¶¶¶

00:26.227 --> 00:28.027
      [breathing heavily]

00:39.473 --> 00:42.307
  I didn't realize there'd be
   so many insects involved.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.188
   We're five minutes early.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.358
    If you're 5 minutes early,
   then you're 10 minutes late.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.260
    Maybe we've missed him.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.196
         Señorita Fay?

01:13.441 --> 01:15.274
  -You put it in there too deep.
             -Sorry.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.213
          <i> Ay, ay, ay.</i>

01:25.086 --> 01:30.255
     This map was handed down
       to me by my ancestor
       Juan Ponce de Leon.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.257
           Thank you.

01:34.161 --> 01:38.564
      For too many years,
     my family has survived
    only on rice and beans.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.232
           Last week,

01:42.470 --> 01:44.103
      we ran out of rice.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.538
            [farts]

01:47.374 --> 01:48.440
              Oh.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.581
     You, my young protégé,

01:56.283 --> 02:00.185
      are looking at the map
  to a location of the legendary
        Fountain of Youth.

02:00.488 --> 02:07.326
This ancient scroll will ensure
  my reign as the world's most
    powerful cosmetics giant

02:07.561 --> 02:08.627
            forever.

02:08.628 --> 02:14.533
 And now, I begin an adventure
  so great, maybe they'll even
     make a movie about it.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.302
    Are you listening to me?

02:17.538 --> 02:18.604
        Of course I am.

02:18.606 --> 02:23.142
   It's just, if you compare
   this map to Google Earth,

02:24.612 --> 02:26.411
     I think you're reading
     this map upside down.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.982
             What?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.651
    So, if I triangulate the
    coordinates, isolate the
region, and align the vicinity--

02:32.653 --> 02:34.937
         Just tell me.

02:34.938 --> 02:37.222
    In what exotic land does
 this fountain of myth reside?

02:39.393 --> 02:42.694
I think it's Encino, California.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.698
      Encino, California?

02:51.505 --> 02:53.438
          [epic music]

03:09.356 --> 03:11.323
        [water running]

03:18.599 --> 03:19.798
     Oh, yeah. F me, right?

03:24.939 --> 03:25.737
              Men.

03:25.739 --> 03:29.675
    You know what? You guys
 are lucky you are all single.

03:30.311 --> 03:34.213
     I think it might help
       if you were just a
     little bit more chill.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.480
               -Me?
              -Yeah.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.715
      -You think it's me?
             -Yes.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.649
          Little bit.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.618
    What? That's ridiculous.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.653
 No one is more chill than me.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.488
       I am the ice man.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.795
              -Wade?
               -Hi.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.387
         This for you.

03:52.388 --> 03:54.311
         I could see from
       your profile picture

03:54.312 --> 03:56.235
      that your apartment
   could use little bit more
  greenery, so I got you this.

03:56.237 --> 03:59.504
   And the pot goes perfectly
   with your Ikea end table.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.639
             What--

04:01.408 --> 04:02.741
           Oh my god.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.978
   Our celebrity couple name
      would be Waynegelo.

04:05.980 --> 04:10.716
  And then, when we're married
and we hyphenate our last names,
yours can go first, but I just--

04:10.718 --> 04:12.818
            -I-- I--
  -Uh, yeah, I'm going to go.

04:14.722 --> 04:15.754
              Hi.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.725
       I didn't know this
       was a double date.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.493
   Oh, these are my parents.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.262
      I've already told them
        so much about you.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.430
            [sighs]

04:28.569 --> 04:29.668
      Where are you going?

04:29.670 --> 04:33.605
    Dude, you've suffocated
      more people than the
       Boston Strangler.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.641
       It's called being
      a hopeless romantic.

04:35.643 --> 04:38.677
      It's called needing
      a restraining order.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.181
 It's why you're single, Wade.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.749
       All right, whatever.
        It doesn't matter,
         okay? I'm done.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.484
   No more men for this guy.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.552
     I've had my heart broken
       one too many times.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.288
     Oh, you say that now.

04:49.490 --> 04:53.292
 But guaranteed, you'll fall in
love with the next guy you meet.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.827
     I will take that bet.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.514
             Done.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.432
  Who keeps money under their
     towel in a steam room?

05:01.468 --> 05:03.802
      Dude, have you ever
      seen our web series?

05:04.838 --> 05:09.408
     There's gotta be more
   to life than just playing
       the pelvic polka.

05:10.311 --> 05:16.381
  No more talking about poon,
  peen, or hook-up highjinks.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.483
          -All right.
       -[Wade] I'm down.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.320
      -Okay, so no sex talk.
              -Nope.

05:22.056 --> 05:23.906
 All right, it's decided then.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.757
  We're going to have to find
     something else to talk
     about other than sex.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.792
     You got it. Let's go.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.672
             -Shh!
      -[crickets chirping]

05:41.408 --> 05:42.607
         Do you guys hear
        crickets chirping?

05:43.410 --> 05:45.143
          Ignore that.

05:45.144 --> 05:46.877
      That's just a metaphor
    to denote awkward silence.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.083
              Oh.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.418
             Cool.

05:54.088 --> 05:55.754
        [birds singing]

05:59.093 --> 06:01.426
        -[closing door]
       -[phone vibrating]

06:04.865 --> 06:06.898
     Well? Is it the place?

06:07.735 --> 06:08.834
          I think so.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.536
  Ponce de Leon, old mission.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.473
        It makes sense.
   It's the perfect place to
    hide an ancient aquifer.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.575
        "I think so" isn't
         going to cut it.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.378
      I just spent my entire
       fortune on that map.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.647
     My cosmetic empire is
  counting on you being right.

06:22.649 --> 06:24.766
          Understood.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.884
I want a coffee and that sample
  on my desk within the hour.

06:31.859 --> 06:36.828
Do you have any idea the amount
  of havoc a jungle expedition
    can wreak on a pedicure?

06:36.830 --> 06:39.564
       This is the worst
       internship ever.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.466
       Just keep filing.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.569
        [Harry] Breathe.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.471
            Breathe.

06:48.142 --> 06:49.141
      Can I help you, son?

06:49.143 --> 06:50.442
          Hello, sir.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.411
I would like to work out today.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.779
   No need to call me "sir."

06:53.781 --> 06:56.548
       Everyone calls me
       Old Man Johnson.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.619
    I'm not really comfortable
        calling you that.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.621
        Well, my name's
     Harry, if that helps.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.890
         Harry Johnson,
      that's much better.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.825
   That'll be $5 for the day.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.565
           Oh, goody.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.635
     I'm going to put this
     towards my retirement.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.903
          Wow, really?

07:20.774 --> 07:21.973
       Go work out, son.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.477
            Breathe!

07:26.713 --> 07:27.979
       Come on, breathe.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.482
     That's not breathing.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.616
     Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.851
      I'm using that, man.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.052
      What are you doing?

07:35.189 --> 07:36.488
           Amateurs.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.533
 [Harry] Here you go. Breathe.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.472
        Dudes, check it.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.575
    My toes are so wrinkled
    they look like raisins.

07:57.611 --> 08:01.480
  Bro, my hands are so wrinkled,
   they're like elephant skin.

08:01.782 --> 08:05.684
   My balls are so wrinkled,
    they look like-- balls.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.152
              Mm.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.587
        It's an analogy.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.021
        It's really not.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.825
     We agreed not to talk
      about sexual stuff.
         Remember that?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.026
        We tried, guys.

08:15.796 --> 08:16.778
            We did.

08:16.779 --> 08:17.761
         -We did try.
         -Good effort.

08:18.565 --> 08:19.898
Same time tomorrow-- steam room?

08:20.567 --> 08:21.500
         -You know it.
             -Yeah.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.519
        Good steam bros.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.070
       -It's an analogy.
         -No, it's not.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.307
       -It's a metaphor.
   -It's more like a simile.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.642
      I'm honestly really
    surprised you even know
      what an analogy is.

08:31.245 --> 08:32.777
   -You compare the two things.
              -Yes.

09:04.845 --> 09:05.911
       What do you think?

09:07.681 --> 09:09.881
     Aren't you putting the
     cart before the horse?

09:09.883 --> 09:13.685
     Success is achieved when
  preparation meets opportunity.

09:14.288 --> 09:15.754
Your sample from the Steam Room.

09:15.756 --> 09:16.688
           Excellent.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.023
       Put it right here.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.559
   I'm going to have the lab
      come and pick it up.

09:20.861 --> 09:24.596
 Now I'm going to need you to
 dig up some dirt on that gym.

09:24.965 --> 09:29.000
         Once this sample
      checks out, I'm going
   to buy that place for cheap.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.735
   Everybody's got a secret.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.871
 I want to know what theirs is.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.806
   What if there is no dirt?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.776
      Oh, trust me, honey.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.144
      There's always dirt.

09:40.314 --> 09:41.246
          That's all.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.851
       [general chatter]

09:49.856 --> 09:51.790
     What's the first rule
       of the Steam Room?

09:51.792 --> 09:55.660
  The first rule of the Steam
    Room is don't talk about
        the Steam Room.

09:55.662 --> 09:56.928
              No.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.897
         No birthdays.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.799
       We got you a gift.

10:01.868 --> 10:05.604
  You shouldn't have-- waited
   so long to give it to me.

10:05.606 --> 10:06.371
         Hand it over.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.739
            Open it.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.678
          New shorts.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.879
             Yeah.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.748
        These might even
        cover your nuts.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.054
   How am I supposed to find
something on the gym if I don't
  even know what to look for?

10:30.731 --> 10:31.763
         Wait a second.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.634
        Hello, gorgeous.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.769
              Yes.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.111
           Nice digs.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.979
         These are great.
          Thanks, guys.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.914
   Think I'm going to need to
   have them shortened a bit.

10:49.916 --> 10:52.784
      So much for tucking
        the testes, huh?

10:53.987 --> 10:54.853
         Harry Johnson?

10:54.855 --> 10:55.987
          You know it.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.722
     You have been served.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.424
   Failure to pay back taxes.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.994
        Lack of compliance
    will cause us to foreclose
      on this establishment.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.396
          Impossible.

11:04.398 --> 11:07.566
           Possible.

11:07.567 --> 11:10.735
        You have two weeks
     to come up with $25,000,
    or we're closing this gym.

11:10.737 --> 11:11.803
           Sign here.

11:11.805 --> 11:16.741
     34 years ago, you had
 a bad year, skipped a payment.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.410
      Taxes and penalties.

11:18.412 --> 11:21.713
       Uncle Sam doesn't
        like deadbeats.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.682
        Have a nice day.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.888
      Uh-- what was that?

11:31.992 --> 11:33.758
          It was 1985.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.294
    The band was Bananarama.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.229
I was their number one groupie.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.132
        I followed them
      all over the world.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.836
     In my travels, I guess
   I forgot to pay my taxes.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.774
 It was a cruel, cruel summer.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.012
  There's got to be something
     we can do, brochachos.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.181
      This place has been
     in the family forever,

11:56.183 --> 11:59.751
    handed down from father
    to son for generations.

11:59.753 --> 12:03.788
   My pops got it from his dad,
      Craven Harry Johnson.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.859
  And he got it from his father,
      Seymour Harry Johnson.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.861
  I don't see the resemblance.

12:14.468 --> 12:16.201
       There's got to be
      something we can do.

12:16.202 --> 12:17.935
     Why don't we just steam?
  That usually gets us thinking.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.904
    Yeah. Let's steam it up.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.073
  And just think of something.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.041
    We'll get through this.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.879
          Sorry, man.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.272
       We can't let Old Man
     Johnson lose this place.

12:54.841 --> 12:57.242
       If it's gone, what
       will happen to us?

13:00.881 --> 13:01.813
           Pardon me.

13:01.815 --> 13:05.049
   I couldn't help but overhear
     your guys' conversation.

13:06.319 --> 13:09.320
 Are you saying that the Steam
    Room is going to close?

13:09.322 --> 13:14.192
  Yeah, that's what you heard
  unless we can think of some
     way to save the place.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.327
           Any ideas?

13:16.329 --> 13:19.264
        I mean, there's no
      fighting the IRS, so--

13:19.266 --> 13:20.932
            So, no.

13:22.836 --> 13:25.336
        Boys, something?

13:25.872 --> 13:29.107
    What we need is a good,
old-fashioned towel snap-a-thon.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.209
        How's that going
        to save the gym?

13:31.211 --> 13:32.410
      Good question, Tad.

13:32.412 --> 13:37.882
     See, nothing is better
   for thinking than getting
       the blood pumping.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.551
             -Okay.
             -Yeah.

13:39.553 --> 13:42.437
          -You're right.
  -Stop! Seriously, please stop.

13:42.438 --> 13:45.322
  Nothing says welcome better
 than being whipped in the ass
  with some wet cotton fabric.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.159
 Please, please-- Please stop.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.029
     Stop? That sounds like
   you're saying keep going.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.096
              Ta!

13:54.000 --> 13:54.966
        All right, guys.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.168
     Guys. Guys. All right.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.271
           I'm Wade.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.307
             Neil.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.975
              ¶¶¶

14:05.378 --> 14:07.879
          [echo] <i> Neil.</i>

14:10.283 --> 14:12.617
       Ow! Who did that?

14:12.619 --> 14:15.420
     Wait! Guys, I got it.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.288
         How much money
      does everyone have?

14:17.290 --> 14:18.223
         I got about...

14:19.059 --> 14:22.160
          24 dollars.

14:22.162 --> 14:25.363
   Wait, that's it. We'll raise
       enough money to save
         the Steam Room.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.866
       Where did you pull
       that money out of?

14:27.868 --> 14:29.601
     Yeah, you're not even
        wearing a towel.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.069
 Where did the coins come from?

14:33.607 --> 14:35.173
           -Coin drops.
             -Gross.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.010
      Neil, maybe you can
        take my number.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.349
      What? He can help us
      save the Steam Room.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.216
             Yeah.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.151
             Wait.

14:47.153 --> 14:49.888
      You want me to hang
      out with you guys?

14:50.190 --> 14:53.892
           Yeah, man. I
      mean, the more bros we
      got, the better it is.

14:54.628 --> 14:55.894
              Ta!

14:59.099 --> 15:00.131
            Got him!

15:03.036 --> 15:04.402
      They're doing what?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.521
   I wouldn't worry about it.

15:06.522 --> 15:08.639
  Those guys are so clueless,
      you could lock them
      in a mattress store,

15:08.642 --> 15:11.042
      and they would still
      sleep on the floor.

15:11.043 --> 15:13.443
       They want to save
      that Steam Room, and
   you're going to help them.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.047
             I am?

15:16.048 --> 15:18.115
     I want you to join their
     little group and report
      everything back to me.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.284
          Spy on them?

15:19.286 --> 15:20.251
              Mhm.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.988
  I'm sorry, I'm not comfortable
         with doing that.

15:23.990 --> 15:28.993
  Oh, Neil, you've been in the
beauty industry for five years?

15:28.995 --> 15:30.528
              Mhm.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.062
      And you're familiar
     with muscle relaxants?

15:32.065 --> 15:33.932
           Mhm. Yeah.

15:36.469 --> 15:42.273
  Just 45 milliliters of pure
    Botox injected directly
     into your sperm worm,

15:42.275 --> 15:46.110
  and the only thing you'll find
   hard is an algebra equation.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.979
  Sally, please be reasonable.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.447
   Can I count on you, Neil?

15:50.951 --> 15:51.950
              Hmm?

15:53.320 --> 15:54.419
           Good boy.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.422
        Now, go do what
       I asked you to do.

16:05.031 --> 16:05.997
              Hmm.

16:12.505 --> 16:13.404
      What are you doing?

16:15.375 --> 16:18.509
        We are mapping out
         our plan, Wade.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.045
    I mean, how else can you
visually represent our intention

16:21.047 --> 16:23.314
  without one of these really
       cool string maps?

16:23.316 --> 16:27.485
  And now, the police can see
 how the plan all came together
    at the end of the movie.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.486
          What police?

16:28.488 --> 16:31.222
Ooh, I like where this is going.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.192
      All right, so we're
      going to use acid to
    disintegrate the bodies

16:34.194 --> 16:36.461
         and pumice stone
      to grind up the teeth.

16:36.463 --> 16:40.198
     N-no one's using acid
       or pumice stones.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.232
             Fine.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.734
         Cement shoes.

16:42.736 --> 16:44.970
       But it is a mess.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.205
Yeah, I'm talking wet concrete.
But hey, it's your place, Wade.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.539
    Hope you're rentin' it.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.041
         [bell ringing]

16:50.377 --> 16:52.143
      I'll be right back.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.411
      [Beau] You do that.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.114
            Oh, hi.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.482
             Hello.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.051
     Oh, how sweet are you?

17:00.787 --> 17:03.388
      Quick, come on inside.
   We're just in the next room.

17:08.494 --> 17:12.563
 So you remember all the guys?
We got Beau, Tad, Ryan, Balton.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.398
          -What's up?
        -Everyone, Neil.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.886
     Hey, what's up, Neil?

17:17.887 --> 17:19.436
          -Respect, man.
    -No, no. His name is Neil.

17:20.272 --> 17:22.106
      [Beau] Just-- just
      stand up. Stand up.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.575
  I'm glad you're here, Neil.

17:24.577 --> 17:28.046
  We're about to make a pact,
     right here, right now,

17:28.048 --> 17:30.181
       one that we're going
      to take to our graves.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.450
        No, we weren't.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.519
      It looks like you guys
        are making a plan?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.438
          Yes, we are.

17:37.439 --> 17:39.489
      And I think we have
        figured it out.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.391
             Wait.

17:44.264 --> 17:49.600
  You guys want to raise $25,000
       by selling cookies?

17:51.137 --> 17:52.070
              Yes!

17:53.807 --> 17:56.474
     I mean, I think a bake
     sale is a great idea.

17:57.243 --> 18:01.212
   Oh, well, if you like it,
     I'd say, let's do it.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.014
              Yes!

18:03.015 --> 18:04.815
          -I love it!
    -Heck, yeah! Heck, yeah!

18:04.818 --> 18:06.651
 [Tad] I want oatmeal cookies.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.419
            [music]

18:08.421 --> 18:10.354
We need some tunes, brochachos.

18:12.459 --> 18:16.494
       <i> ¶ Today is gonna be</i>
    <i> A little something more ¶</i>

18:17.564 --> 18:22.100

      <i> Says get up and play ¶</i>

18:27.307 --> 18:28.840
       I got the Crisco.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.708
   Aren't-- aren't you supposed
    to use butter for cookies?

18:31.845 --> 18:34.212
       Oh right, this isn't
         for the cookies.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.614

           Ooh, ooh!

19:01.341 --> 19:02.507
          -Ooh, nice.
             -Mm--

19:02.509 --> 19:04.609
          Ow! Ow! Ow!

19:04.611 --> 19:06.244
            -Ah! Ah!
-Why are you handing it to me?!

19:06.246 --> 19:07.478
     Why did you do that?!

19:07.480 --> 19:08.613
Put it down! Put it down! Jeez!

19:08.615 --> 19:09.714
              Oh!

19:09.716 --> 19:14.185
     -I knew I should have
    got everyone oven mitts.
      -That was hot, bros!

19:14.187 --> 19:16.287
  Why would you hand it to me?

19:23.329 --> 19:25.880
         Talk to me about
        your supply chain.

19:25.881 --> 19:28.432
    Are these locally sourced?
       And are any of these
      vegan or gluten-free?

19:29.636 --> 19:30.935
      Oh, I'll take this.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.254
       Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.572
        The cacao beans
   were harvested by virgins
    listening to harp music.

19:36.176 --> 19:40.278
         And the flour?
   Well, the flour was grown
  in the fields of Brigadoon,

19:40.280 --> 19:42.513
        which only appears
      every 100 years or so.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.183
      So you can imagine how
    difficult that was to get.

19:45.185 --> 19:49.487
         And the eggs?
    Well, the eggs, the eggs
   are donated from chickens

19:49.489 --> 19:51.722
       that get acupuncture
      treatments from yogis.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.724
            Namaste.

19:54.928 --> 19:58.262
Really? Virgins? That's amazing.

19:58.264 --> 20:00.364
      Look, I'll give you
      $5 for 10 cookies.

20:00.934 --> 20:04.702
How about you pay what the sign
  says there, Obi-Wan Kenobi?

20:07.740 --> 20:08.806
           Whatever.

20:09.275 --> 20:10.641
 Tried to pull a fast one, huh?

20:11.678 --> 20:13.311
           Thanks, man.
       Hey, appreciate you.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.312
       Tell your friends.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.947
Tag us. Follow us and all that.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.482
    Hey, boys, shouldn't we
   be selling these for more?

20:18.484 --> 20:19.417
              Why?

20:19.419 --> 20:20.518
          Uh, virgins?

20:22.288 --> 20:23.754
  There ain't no damn virgins.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.424
   Wait, who's a virgin, bro?

              ¶¶¶

20:44.310 --> 20:46.844
    I just want one so bad.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.280
         Look at them.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.983
      They're mocking me.

20:51.985 --> 20:53.784
  I got a gallon of milk, bro.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.321
     It's organic as shit.

          <i> I dare you.</i>

21:02.845 --> 21:05.663
     Oh, on second thought,
    you're not worthy of my
      rich chocolate chips

21:05.665 --> 21:08.699
       and my incredible
         chewy center.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.502
       Fuck you, cookie.

21:11.504 --> 21:14.272
     Yeah, I'm your master.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.039
           It's okay.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.574
      It's just a cookie.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.578
       No, he's a little
     confectionery bastard.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.847
        Eat me, fucker.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.348
     -Oh, you little shit!
       -Whoa, whoa, dude.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.349
          No, come on.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.318
   It's all sugar and carbs.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.686
  Think of your shredded abs.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.355
 -Think about the 5% body fat.
             -Yeah.

21:31.357 --> 21:35.526
  It's just-- it's fine. It's-
it's just a little nibble, okay?
  I did my CrossFit for today.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.495
       I could just crush
       those carbs, man.

21:37.497 --> 21:40.731
      I don't know, bros,
     it's a slippery slope.

21:41.501 --> 21:45.770
      I remember the great
    Lay's incident of 2014.

21:45.772 --> 21:46.771
             Yeah.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.439
      I remember that too.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.509
     I had two chicks bobbing
        upside down on me.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.811
 One chick, she actually tried
  to stick a zucchini where--

21:53.813 --> 21:55.646
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:55.648 --> 22:00.084
   Not that Lay's incident,
   the other Lay's incident.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.552
        I'll remind you.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.654
     Everyone thoughtfully
     look up to your left.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.458
    Your other left, Balton.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.677
           Oh my god.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.080
        -[voice] Do it.
          -Wait, what?

22:29.082 --> 22:30.681
       -[Tad] Oh my god.
         -Good or bad?

22:30.683 --> 22:31.782
          Bad or good?

22:31.784 --> 22:32.683
           That good?

22:32.685 --> 22:33.651
        Let me get one!
           That good?

22:33.653 --> 22:35.553
             -Hey!
     -Let me get one, bro!

22:35.555 --> 22:36.787
        [all screaming]

22:40.693 --> 22:42.393
      [voices distorting]

23:00.146 --> 23:04.448
   What are you doing? What are
  you doing? What are you doing?

23:04.450 --> 23:05.916
   Didn't you learn anything
      from that flashback?

23:05.918 --> 23:07.885
           Dude, no.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.720
         Come on, guys.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.722
       One little cookie
       never hurt anyone.

23:11.724 --> 23:12.757
              See?

23:16.496 --> 23:18.629
      Mhm, chocolate chip.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.398
       Did you see that?

23:20.666 --> 23:22.533
    Neil ate a goddamn carb.

23:23.169 --> 23:26.504
     -Dude. Oh, what, what...
             -Oh! Oh!

23:26.506 --> 23:28.572
   God, that's so delicious.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.574
            Oh. Oh.

23:30.576 --> 23:31.876
       Oh my god, it is.

23:31.878 --> 23:32.943
       Where's the milk?

23:33.579 --> 23:35.546
 I got a chocolate chip chubby.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.150
               -Oh.
          -That's sugar.

23:39.152 --> 23:40.651
       That's real sugar.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.686
       Oh my god, it's like
         sex in my mouth.

23:43.856 --> 23:44.955
      [Balton] Oh my god!

23:47.627 --> 23:48.959
          [epic music]

24:32.939 --> 24:36.240
  What kind of devil are you?

24:36.242 --> 24:37.675
             What?

24:49.555 --> 24:50.554
             Neil!

24:52.792 --> 24:53.891
         There you are.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.860
       What's the latest?

24:55.862 --> 24:58.863
     The guys had a cookie
       sale on Saturday.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.915
         A cookie sale?

25:00.916 --> 25:02.966
  Yeah, it went so badly that
  they're now in the hole $30.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.502
 Oh my god, you had to see it.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.704
       They were-- there
       was a flour fight.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.672
      Their shirts came off.
   There was licking of spoons.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.808
     Actually, the cookies
     were pretty darn good.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.577
  But in the end, they started
  eating all of their product.

25:13.579 --> 25:15.513
     So, it was hilarious.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.650
       Why are you here?

25:20.620 --> 25:21.552
        In your office?

25:21.554 --> 25:22.953
         In my employ?

25:22.955 --> 25:26.857
        Because you pay
       me $4.96 an hour?

25:27.527 --> 25:29.927
      You're here because
 you're my personal assistant.

25:30.596 --> 25:35.032
  And as such, your allegiance
belongs to me and this company.

25:36.002 --> 25:39.003
     Those Steam Room boys
     are not your friends.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.005
     And you're not theirs.

25:41.007 --> 25:44.108
     Have you've forgotten
     how cruel kids can be,

25:45.945 --> 25:47.545
          pizza face?

25:47.547 --> 25:53.751
 Pizza face, pizza face, pizza
face, pizza, pizza, pizza face!

25:53.753 --> 25:55.853
      This is our territory,
           pizza face.

25:55.855 --> 25:58.289
  No one wants your poop-corn
      or crappy trail mix.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.891
 It's all about the Do-si-dos,
         motherfucker.

26:00.893 --> 26:06.664
    He's not a Boy Scout, he's
   a Boil Scout! Hey, look, his
   face has so much oil on it,

26:06.666 --> 26:08.899
         -you can make
     French fries with it.
   -Let's give him a wedgie.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.336
   Cross our troop again, and
 we'll Tagalong your ugly ass.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.170
            Come on.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.808
        Two against one.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.312
         Not very nice.

26:21.314 --> 26:23.781
         -[Neil] Stop.
     -Are you going to cry?

26:23.783 --> 26:25.783
          -little pizza?
         -Mean. Not nice.

26:28.721 --> 26:32.340
           Oh my god.

26:32.341 --> 26:35.960
    You, unfortunate-looking
 creature, let me take a look.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.595
             Oh my.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.598
    Don't worry, I can help.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.634
            Oh okay.

26:43.635 --> 26:46.669
  I'm Sally Fay, of the Sally
      Fay Cosmetic empire.

26:46.672 --> 26:50.207
        And you shall be
        my new project.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.110
   Come, we'll have a cookie.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.048
          Love these.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.084
       Friends of yours?

27:01.687 --> 27:02.620
            Kind of.

27:03.689 --> 27:04.888
       What's your name?

27:04.890 --> 27:05.956
             Neil.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.691
          Hello, Neil.

27:07.693 --> 27:08.692
             Hello.

27:08.694 --> 27:10.127
       This is my house.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.831
     Wow, it's really nice.

27:17.770 --> 27:19.103
         Never forget.

27:20.706 --> 27:24.208
       It was beauty that
       killed the beast.

27:27.813 --> 27:31.749
     Now, I need you to go
      out there and get me
        that Steam Room.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.884
     Do this for us, Neil.

27:43.796 --> 27:47.197
           [laughing]

28:18.464 --> 28:21.031
    Guys, why the sad faces?

28:21.033 --> 28:23.033
     We didn't make any money
        off the bake sale.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.003
     In fact, we're worse off
       than we were before.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.872
     Well, hey, I sold $20
       worth of cookies.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.442
   Yeah, and I got a little
   tonsil tango on the side.

28:31.444 --> 28:34.745
  That's just because you gave
   those cheerleaders a kiss
 for every cookie they bought.

28:34.747 --> 28:35.846
             Yeah.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.916
    I really wish they were
      female cheerleaders.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.852
      But I will admit, they
       had some soft lips.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.221
    And they used just the
    right amount of tongue.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.191
       Ooh, that's sexy.

28:47.193 --> 28:48.258
          Oh, it was.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.860
           No, wait.

28:50.463 --> 28:51.328
           That's it.

28:52.198 --> 28:53.163
              Sex.

28:53.799 --> 28:55.933
          Sex, S-E-X.

28:55.934 --> 28:58.068
     Beau, if you think I'm
      just going to become
    a male prostitute, man,

28:58.070 --> 28:59.303
 you got another thing coming.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.939
      Unless there's good
      money in it, though.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.774
      I'll sell some ass.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.008
    I'll be out there, man.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.176
       You won't tell my
      mom, though, right?

29:06.178 --> 29:08.228
     Oh, I don't-- I don't
         know your mom.

29:08.229 --> 29:10.279
No, but Beau is onto something.
   If we want to make money,

29:10.282 --> 29:13.117
      we're going to have
   to do it the old-fashioned
      way, and sex sells.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.151
            Exactly.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.487
             Right.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.822
    That's why I don't even
    leave the house without,
     you know-- thank you.

29:18.824 --> 29:19.857
        Is that a binky?

29:19.859 --> 29:21.024
             -Mhm.
          -[squeaking]

29:22.194 --> 29:23.260
           All right.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.196
 Wait, are you judging me, bro?

29:27.967 --> 29:30.234
        Uh-- okay, well,
        what's the plan?

29:30.236 --> 29:31.969
 We could open a kissing booth.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.104
 That's actually perfect, Wade.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.839
      Yes. More like that.

29:35.841 --> 29:38.008
    I do chores at the nursing
       home for extra cash.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.843
        -[Wade] Really?
          -Yeah, yeah.

29:39.845 --> 29:42.246
    Yeah, one guy gives me
    $100 for a sponge bath.

29:42.248 --> 29:47.017
    Some guy gives you $100
   to give him a sponge bath?

29:47.019 --> 29:49.853
No, he gives me the sponge bath.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.423
               -Oh.
              -Okay.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.291
  Okay, well, that's going in
    the maybe column, yeah.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.326
    You guys, you feel that?

29:56.328 --> 29:59.830
   You feel that moneymaking
       montage coming on?

29:59.832 --> 30:01.865
             -Yeah!
          -All right!

30:01.867 --> 30:03.867
       Cue the motivational
        Katy Perry music.

30:03.869 --> 30:05.335
     -¶<i> Baby you don't-- ¶</i>
       -Do not sing that!

30:05.337 --> 30:07.871
        We cannot afford
    that kind of licensing.

30:07.873 --> 30:10.007
We'll just use some stock music.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.074
             Yeah.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.176
      Let's do this bros.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.577
      Stock music montage.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.212
          -All right!
             -Whoa!

30:15.548 --> 30:17.181
              ¶¶¶

30:31.897 --> 30:33.597
      Car wash! Let's go!

30:33.599 --> 30:36.400
        -Don't be weird!
      -Watch us wash you!

30:39.171 --> 30:41.238
              ¶¶¶

31:02.261 --> 31:04.094
     [whispering] Oh, yeah.

31:14.607 --> 31:16.240
               -Hi.
     -How much is a car wash?

31:16.242 --> 31:17.174
          That's $20.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.208
      Ooh, I've got that.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.243
   Yeah you do, right there.

31:19.245 --> 31:22.246
Nice. Where's your car, though?

31:22.248 --> 31:23.347
           You're it.

31:25.351 --> 31:29.353
 If you play your cards right,
   I'll polish your tailpipe.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.021
          Here we go.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.289
 Oh, you're just going for it.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.357
  Oh, I'm going to scrub you.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.325
 Oh, I'm going to get your leg.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.194
     Let me get your legs.

31:37.196 --> 31:41.031
       Ooh, they're so long
          and handsome.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.448
      Hey, that'll be $20.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.218
    Appreciate it. Tell your
    boyfriend or girlfriend.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.352
         -No judgment.
             -Okay.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.921
         Okay. Bye now.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.455
 Oh, a tip? Thank you so much.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.457
     I was actually hoping
          for change.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.393
        You know what? You
   can write it off your taxes.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.295
         It's awesome.

32:11.296 --> 32:13.196
     Thank you. Appreciate
        it. Bye-bye now.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.465
              ¶¶¶

32:37.690 --> 32:41.491
 Guys, we made almost $15,000.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.429
 Like, seriously. Oh, $15,000.

32:45.431 --> 32:46.964
             Yeah.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.432
              -Dude.
         -These bad boys.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.167
         No, no, Ryan.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.569
     Hey, let's put the money
      right here in his bag.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.371
        Give me the bag.

32:54.373 --> 32:55.405
              Mhm.

32:56.742 --> 32:57.975
           Put it in.

33:10.522 --> 33:11.588
      He's not here, Wade.

33:13.058 --> 33:13.991
              Who?

33:14.293 --> 33:15.292
             Neil.

33:15.294 --> 33:21.164
  Didn't you notice how weird
   Wade was being during that
      moneymaking montage?

33:23.369 --> 33:25.419
      Wade's always weird.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.470
    Yeah, yeah, definitely.
        But he was being
       like, extra weird.

33:27.473 --> 33:32.175
      Like, Wade is for sure
        crushing on Neil.

33:32.177 --> 33:35.746
              Mhm.

33:35.747 --> 33:39.316
     I'm right here, okay?
 And I'm not crushing on Neil,
   okay? I've sworn off men.

33:39.318 --> 33:43.253
 Dude, Neil is smart, handsome.

33:43.255 --> 33:47.324
      He's really helpful.
    I mean, he taught me the
 perfect way to do my laundry.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.425
     My whites are whiter.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.427
    My colors are brighter.

33:50.429 --> 33:53.363
          And my shirts?
    They're perfectly pressed.

33:58.303 --> 34:00.103
        I think you used
        too much starch.

34:00.406 --> 34:02.272
 I was referring to my shirts.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.041
     That's my happy sock.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.309
              -Oh!
          -Aw, Jesus.

34:06.311 --> 34:07.377
        You sniffed it.

34:07.379 --> 34:12.149
     Wade, you just got to
    own up to it, you know?

34:12.518 --> 34:17.254
       Like, face it, you
     are falling for Neil.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.188
          No, I'm not.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.456
             Okay.

34:20.458 --> 34:25.629
    You know that old maple
       up on Norton Lane?

34:26.264 --> 34:28.532
       I love that tree.

34:28.534 --> 34:32.402
      The orphan children,
  they play in its shade when
the blossoms are in full bloom.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.405
  And it's been watching over
 the community for generations.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.239
     Yeah, yeah, that one.

34:46.318 --> 34:50.187
   This looks oddly familiar,
wouldn't you say, Wade? I mean,

34:50.188 --> 34:52.121
   is that your handwriting?
     I-I can't make it out.

34:52.123 --> 34:53.857
     You cut down the tree?

34:53.859 --> 34:56.827
     Well, yes, of course.

34:56.829 --> 34:58.295
    I mean, this is for you.

34:58.297 --> 34:59.880
   I did this for you, Wade.

34:59.881 --> 35:01.464
      You need to get a grip
         on your reality.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.599
         Look at this!

35:03.836 --> 35:05.368
         You could have
      just taken a photo.

35:06.839 --> 35:07.671
             Yeah.

35:09.575 --> 35:12.642
    What shade will the orphan
      children play in now?

35:14.346 --> 35:17.247
 W--w-- we'll buy them a tarp.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.583
     All right, fine, okay?

35:19.585 --> 35:21.118
     I'm falling for Neil.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.320
             -Aha!
          -But-- but--

35:23.322 --> 35:24.321
      I don't want to be!

35:24.323 --> 35:26.240
           I knew it.

35:26.241 --> 35:28.158
 I don't want to lose my heart
   to another guy that's just
    going to break it, okay?

35:28.894 --> 35:32.195
     Well, I don't want to
     lose the Steam Room.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.631
   So we need to focus, guys.

35:34.633 --> 35:38.869
 Look, look, look, look, look,
 he's right, okay? We still got
    to come up with $10,000

35:38.871 --> 35:40.721
   more to pay this tax man.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.572
    Yeah, well, we got to come
        up with something.

35:42.574 --> 35:43.507
             Yeah.

35:43.509 --> 35:49.412
None of us are leaving this room
  until we come up with a way
  of getting that money, okay?

35:50.215 --> 35:52.582
      -So, let's just think.
     -[Ryan] All right, cool.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.352
              Hmm.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.557
    What are we doing here?

36:01.894 --> 36:03.493
I do my best thinking at a bar.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.762
      You mean, a gay bar?

36:06.632 --> 36:08.298
       This is a gay bar?

36:08.634 --> 36:10.167
     Hmm, I didn't notice.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.169
        Well, hey, man,
      I ain't complaining.

36:12.171 --> 36:16.273
 You know, I haven't had to pay
 for a drink since we got here.

36:16.909 --> 36:18.175
         Cheers, boys.

36:18.577 --> 36:19.910
             Ha ha!

36:19.912 --> 36:21.311
          I love you.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.381
              Ooh.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.448
     What about a contest?

36:26.518 --> 36:27.717
        What about one?

36:27.719 --> 36:29.486
        Where are we going
     to find a contest, Wade?

36:29.488 --> 36:30.587
         I don't know.

36:30.589 --> 36:34.157
     I'm just bro-storming.

36:34.158 --> 36:37.726
     Look guys, there's gotta
   be something that we can do
   with a cash prize of $5,000.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.733
        Yeah, but what?

36:45.737 --> 36:47.571
         I don't know.
      I'm coming up empty.

36:48.674 --> 36:51.374
  Yep, and I'm coming up full.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.710
 Gotta go drain the main vein,
     you know what I mean?

36:54.546 --> 36:55.745
  I mean I gotta take a piss.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.353
      You got no abs, bro.

37:05.490 --> 37:06.756
          [urinating]

37:08.493 --> 37:09.359
             What?

37:09.628 --> 37:10.627
              Ha!

37:12.331 --> 37:15.265
 Look, look, look, look, look!
     Look, bros, I got it.

37:15.267 --> 37:16.850
           I got it.

37:16.851 --> 37:18.434
  -It's a wet undies contest.
     -[Ryan] Wet underwear?

37:18.437 --> 37:19.569
             Look!

37:19.571 --> 37:21.438
        Oh, I'm looking.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.339
              Oh.

37:23.308 --> 37:24.374
              Oh.

37:25.744 --> 37:32.649
      Cash prize, $5,000?
     Yo, we got this, guys.

37:33.518 --> 37:34.551
     Let's roll out, bros.

37:34.553 --> 37:35.619
 [Wade] All right, let's do it.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.654
      [Tad] Yeah, brosefs.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.532
          Five grand.

37:58.343 --> 37:59.309
             Neil?

38:00.545 --> 38:02.545
         Yoo-hoo, Neil?

38:04.349 --> 38:05.482
      Where have you been?

38:05.484 --> 38:07.134
   I was getting your coffee.

38:07.135 --> 38:08.785
    When can I take control
      of that Steam Room?

38:08.787 --> 38:10.053
       I'm working on it.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.656
 I can see that you have been.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.561
      Just look what I found
          in your desk.

38:19.298 --> 38:21.564
Please tell me those boys aren't
  going to raise enough money

38:21.566 --> 38:23.433
      to save their precious
           Steam Room?

38:23.435 --> 38:24.801
    I have it under control.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.070
        I sent in a boy
      to do a woman's job.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.571
   They're not going to win.

38:28.573 --> 38:30.407
        I can't risk it.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.841
        I need a ringer.

38:32.678 --> 38:36.813
   Willie Mammoth. He's done
 some work for me in the past.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.581
         Construction.

38:39.351 --> 38:40.417
           Find him.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.319
   Pay him whatever it takes.

38:42.321 --> 38:43.386
       Win that contest.

38:43.388 --> 38:44.654
        Do not fail me.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.524
  Oh, and tell him to call me.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.726
   My chimney needs sweeping.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.628
             Again.

38:51.630 --> 38:56.433
      If anyone needs me,
   I'll be meeting with those
     dimwits of the board.

38:57.703 --> 39:01.604
     It's time for me to take
         back my company.

39:08.814 --> 39:09.779
             [ding]

39:27.099 --> 39:27.964
           Gentlemen.

39:27.966 --> 39:33.870
     I called this meeting
      because I'm planning
  something big, fresh, young.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.839
       Well, we're happy
      to hear that, Sally.

39:35.841 --> 39:39.442
  Because the board of directors
      has unanimously agreed

39:39.444 --> 39:44.414
      that maybe it's time
      to change the image
    of Sally Fay cosmetics.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.517
Give it a makeover, if you will.

39:47.519 --> 39:50.420
         Makeover? Yes.

39:50.689 --> 39:53.490
     Gentlemen, I couldn't
     agree with you more.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.392
    Your timing is perfect.

39:55.394 --> 39:58.061
     I've been working on--

39:58.062 --> 40:00.729
   That means there's no longer
     any place for you here.

40:00.732 --> 40:01.931
         Hold it, what?

40:02.601 --> 40:03.600
              Me?

40:03.602 --> 40:07.904
   You want to fire Sally Fay
   from Sally Fay Cosmetics?

40:09.508 --> 40:11.608
       Sales have been down
          for years now.

40:11.610 --> 40:14.911
   And as a beauty company,
   we're no longer relevant.

40:16.148 --> 40:18.848
   You're no longer relevant.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.785
        The world wants
     young and attractive.

40:22.454 --> 40:29.826
     And experienced women
 such as yourself just doesn't
 cut it on a billboard anymore.

40:30.729 --> 40:31.861
         Sorry, Sally.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.030
   This is still my company.

40:34.032 --> 40:40.470
     And I am this close to a
  breakthrough that will change
  the cosmetic industry forever,

40:40.472 --> 40:43.606
     and put Sally Fay back
   on top where she belongs.

40:43.608 --> 40:47.510
  I will unveil my new discovery
    this Friday, here at noon.

40:47.779 --> 40:51.648
  And if you want it, it's going
   to cost you each one share.

40:52.217 --> 40:55.585
    This Friday, here, noon.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.023
You've got 30 seconds to reply.

41:00.725 --> 41:01.791
            Tic toc.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.594
          Now it's 29.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.796
     I'll be out in my car.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.665
      Text me your reply.

41:08.667 --> 41:09.866
        Make it snappy.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.839
    Mumble, mumble, mumble.
    Mumble, mumble, mumble.

41:15.841 --> 41:17.674
    Mumble, mumble, mumble.
    Mumble, mumble, mumble.

41:17.676 --> 41:18.942
    Mumble, mumble, mumble.

41:24.716 --> 41:26.983
       Okay, boys, ready
        to get started?

41:27.486 --> 41:30.954
  Hey, man, don't you think this
   is a bit much? I mean, it's
  just a wet underwear contest.

41:30.956 --> 41:38.027
Filling out a dong sarong ain't
  enough, okay? It's all about
  stage presence, showmanship.

41:38.029 --> 41:41.231
    That's why I brought in
   a real pro to help us get
    ready for this contest.

41:41.233 --> 41:42.565
         Wait a minute.

41:42.834 --> 41:43.800
    What is she going to do?

41:43.802 --> 41:45.702
     Meet my niece, Susie.

41:46.238 --> 41:50.640
  Head of her cheer squad and
  one kick-ass choreographer.

41:50.876 --> 41:54.811
    Susie, dear, do you mind
 showing the boys a few moves?

41:54.813 --> 41:55.745
             Sure.

41:55.747 --> 42:00.650
     You pencil pricks look
  like rejects from an Olivia
    Newton-John music video.

42:00.652 --> 42:03.953
       If you're serious
   about winning, you better
    man up and listen good.

42:03.955 --> 42:07.557
 For the next hour, you're my
 little man bitches, capiche?!

42:08.927 --> 42:09.993
            Capiche.

42:09.995 --> 42:11.895
           Uh, okay.

42:20.972 --> 42:22.071
             [ding]

42:22.974 --> 42:24.040
              Hmm.

42:25.710 --> 42:26.776
             [ding]

42:28.613 --> 42:30.113
 Oh, smiling chocolate pudding.

42:31.283 --> 42:33.049
      It's a pile of shit.

42:36.922 --> 42:40.056
  I already told you 15 times!

42:40.058 --> 42:44.961
    It's spin! Grab! Twist!
    Thrust! Pop! And bang!

42:45.997 --> 42:48.932
       Have any of you guys
     ever gotten laid before?

42:49.901 --> 42:54.904
      Ever see a girl with
   a sweet, tight, butt that
     you just have to have?

42:54.906 --> 42:55.738
           Oh, yeah.

42:55.740 --> 43:00.610
     Now squeeze it! Grab it!
      And thrust as if your
       life depends on it!

43:00.612 --> 43:03.846
      Gay guys, same ass,
    just imagine it's hairy!

43:05.317 --> 43:06.616
              Ooh!

43:06.618 --> 43:10.053
   So, do you think we actually
     have a shot at winning?

43:11.790 --> 43:13.089
            Fuck no.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.959
     Got to bounce, uncle,
        babysitting gig.

43:15.961 --> 43:17.927
              -Okay.
       -If you pussies want
        a shot at winning,

43:17.929 --> 43:20.863
     you better keep going
  till you don't suck so much!

43:22.334 --> 43:24.634
Um, that's actually mine, but--

43:24.636 --> 43:26.803
 Oh, you want it? Come get it.

43:26.805 --> 43:28.788
          I dare you.

43:28.789 --> 43:30.772
     No, no. No, I'm good.
 I'll see you at Thanksgiving.

43:30.775 --> 43:31.874
           Good call.

43:34.045 --> 43:35.111
           All right.

43:35.113 --> 43:38.848
      Now, where were we?
 Banging and thrusting, right?

43:39.684 --> 43:42.652
             Yeah!

43:42.653 --> 43:45.621
        Tad, come on, more
     banging! All right, now,
       where's the swizzle?

43:45.624 --> 43:47.090
  All right, let me see that.
         And thrusting!

43:47.092 --> 43:48.658
          Dude. Dude.

43:48.660 --> 43:49.859
              -What?
          -That's weird.

44:00.805 --> 44:02.872
       So, you and the guys
        seem really close.

44:02.874 --> 44:04.707
     Yeah. We're all bros.

44:05.677 --> 44:08.211
        Is there anyone
     special in your life?

44:08.947 --> 44:14.384
   Well, I just got out of a
 long-term relationship, and it
  still kinda hurts, you know?

44:14.386 --> 44:15.752
           I'm sorry.

44:15.987 --> 44:17.120
     How long did it last?

44:18.123 --> 44:19.656
           Six hours.

44:21.726 --> 44:22.792
              Oh.

44:23.662 --> 44:24.927
      I have to be honest,

44:25.697 --> 44:27.330
     you're quite the cook.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.964
         I can't remember
     the last time that I had
    a homemade meal like this.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.667
  I'm just glad you liked it.

44:30.669 --> 44:33.136
    I can't believe you ate
      that whole sausage.

44:33.138 --> 44:35.422
       It was delicious.

44:35.423 --> 44:37.707
     -But without chewing?
        -Oh, trick jaw.

44:37.709 --> 44:40.226
        So, my dad says
     I get it from my mom.

44:40.227 --> 44:42.744
 I've won first place in every
     hot dog eating contest
     that I've ever joined,

44:42.747 --> 44:45.181
     and I can actually fit
   three weiners in my mouth
       at the same time.

44:45.183 --> 44:46.949
         -Oh-- oh, oh.
             -Whoa.

44:47.919 --> 44:49.886
      I am-- I'm so sorry.

44:49.888 --> 44:50.853
              Uh--

45:04.469 --> 45:08.071
       Man, Susie kicked
     our butts today, bro.

45:08.073 --> 45:09.439
           Yeah, man.

45:09.441 --> 45:12.108
      This feels so good.

45:12.109 --> 45:14.776
     How about our boy, Wade,
      though? He's got that
     date with Neil tonight.

45:14.779 --> 45:17.146
  Man, he is such a bromantic.

45:17.148 --> 45:22.051
    I bet you he's pulling out
   all the stops, like, getting
        the candles going,

45:22.053 --> 45:26.055
     with the smooth music
         and some wine.

45:28.126 --> 45:30.326
      Wait a second, bro.

45:31.896 --> 45:32.895
             What?

45:34.499 --> 45:35.798
            Cheers.

45:35.800 --> 45:36.866
            Cheers.

45:44.943 --> 45:46.209
          [soft music]

45:58.857 --> 46:00.223
     This was really nice.

46:00.225 --> 46:03.893
    I have to say, I really
      like you-- the guys.

46:04.262 --> 46:09.832
    Well, uh, I-- the guys,
      really like you too.

46:10.802 --> 46:11.534
            Really?

46:11.536 --> 46:12.301
             Yeah.

46:12.303 --> 46:15.505
    You know, the Steam Room
guys don't just let anybody in.

46:15.507 --> 46:17.306
You have to be someone special.

46:17.308 --> 46:18.908
       We're like family.

46:22.013 --> 46:24.847
       Do-- do you not have
        any family, Neil?

46:24.849 --> 46:28.050
Well, my boss is like my family.

46:29.087 --> 46:31.387
       And to be honest,
   she's like my only friend.

46:32.991 --> 46:35.358
     Well, now you have us.

46:36.261 --> 46:39.796
     And that's what being
    a bro is all about, bro.

46:42.333 --> 46:44.066
      -I should probably go.
              -Uh...

46:45.537 --> 46:46.969
We haven't even had dessert yet.

46:46.971 --> 46:49.272
  I should watch my calories.

46:49.274 --> 46:51.808
    I have this can of whipped
        cream right here.

46:53.144 --> 46:54.310
         I don't know.

46:54.312 --> 47:00.283
      What about something
   long, hard, eight inches?

47:01.352 --> 47:02.318
            I can't.

47:03.555 --> 47:04.854
            You can.

47:04.856 --> 47:06.355
    You like celery, right?

47:08.126 --> 47:09.158
     Come on, take a bite.

47:13.097 --> 47:14.230
              Mmm.

47:14.933 --> 47:15.965
          [chuckling]

47:21.840 --> 47:24.173
  Someone got laid last night.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.908
              Mhm.

47:25.910 --> 47:29.378
    What gave it away? Was
    it my relaxed demeanor?

47:29.380 --> 47:33.883
      My glowing complexion?
          My wry smile?

47:33.885 --> 47:37.186
       Or the pillow for
       you sore behind?

47:37.188 --> 47:39.021
              Oh.

47:39.023 --> 47:44.627
 Well, I'm not one to kiss and
 tell, but we did go through an
  entire can of whipped cream

47:44.629 --> 47:45.995
        before dessert.

47:45.997 --> 47:46.863
              Ooh.

47:46.865 --> 47:47.897
            -Right?
             -Wow.

47:47.899 --> 47:49.298
     Okay, wow, impressive.

47:49.300 --> 47:52.468
  But guys, we can't just sit
  and gab and steam all day.

47:53.004 --> 47:54.604
       We've got to prepare
           for tonight.

47:54.606 --> 47:56.305
     Big night ahead of us.

47:56.307 --> 47:59.108
        It's just a wet
    underwear contest, bro.

47:59.344 --> 48:00.343
             Relax.

48:00.345 --> 48:04.046
    Okay, you just get down
 to your little whitey-tighties
         you got there,

48:04.349 --> 48:06.215
       and you shake what
       your mama gave ya.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.285
           That's it.

48:09.287 --> 48:12.388
I do it every night in front of
my apartment window, all right?

48:15.360 --> 48:18.361
What? How do you pay your rent?

48:18.363 --> 48:19.929
   I'm not touching that one.

48:19.931 --> 48:20.997
        You do you, bro.

48:23.034 --> 48:25.935
   -What are you looking at?
    -This-- it just doesn't
          make sense.

48:25.937 --> 48:27.003
     You're right. It doesn't
           make sense.

48:27.005 --> 48:28.437
     Is Justin Bieber here?

48:29.207 --> 48:31.374
Oh my god! I'm such a huge fan!

48:33.044 --> 48:37.013
      I mean, my daughter
   would love his autograph.

48:37.015 --> 48:40.116
    I'm uh, Dustin Cleaver?

48:42.020 --> 48:44.186
    I want my test results.

48:44.188 --> 48:46.155
        I can have them
     for you by 5 o'clock.

48:46.157 --> 48:49.191
I explicitly told Neil I needed
till the end of day on Friday.

48:50.461 --> 48:52.094
       Take a good look.

48:52.096 --> 48:54.196
            This is my
  don't-fuck-with-me-fella face.

48:54.966 --> 48:56.332
   I want those results now.

48:56.334 --> 49:01.704
     Uh-- I-I did already run
    a pH and chemical compound
       test on the sample.

49:01.706 --> 49:04.490
              And?

49:04.491 --> 49:07.275
 It has the compound structure
     of two parts hydrogen
      and one part oxygen.

49:07.946 --> 49:11.280
  It's perfect pH balance and
rich in natural ground minerals.

49:11.282 --> 49:13.015
           Excellent.

49:13.017 --> 49:17.486
 We'll patent the combination,
      hydrogen and oxygen.

49:17.488 --> 49:20.690
     But what to name this
     miraculous compound?

49:20.692 --> 49:24.694
     Something short, simple,
        clean, refreshing.

49:24.696 --> 49:27.363
        How about water?

49:29.067 --> 49:31.701
           Excuse me?

49:31.702 --> 49:34.336
   Two parts hydrogen and one
part oxygen. It's-- it's water.

49:35.106 --> 49:36.339
         Give me that.

49:39.043 --> 49:40.376
       I'm sorry, Sally.

49:40.378 --> 49:42.244
        It's Sally Fay.

49:42.714 --> 49:44.513
       Just like it says
        on your checks.

49:45.283 --> 49:47.483
     Or at least, used to.

49:48.386 --> 49:49.986
         You're fired.

49:54.125 --> 49:55.424
   Here's a pro tip for you.

49:55.426 --> 50:00.463
    When the boss doesn't know
     that two parts hydrogen,
    one part oxygen is water,

50:00.465 --> 50:02.298
      you don't tell her.

50:06.204 --> 50:11.340
     Ladies and gentlemen,
  welcome to West Hollywood's
   Annual Wet Undies Contest.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.042
        Make some noise.

50:15.046 --> 50:18.114
       I'm your hostess,
   Billy Francesca, tonight.

50:18.115 --> 50:21.183
    Now, listen, we are giving
    away $5,000 to the biggest
     wiener-- I mean, winner.

50:21.185 --> 50:22.635
     That's a lot of money.

50:22.636 --> 50:24.086
     Warm it up, kids, or I'm
   going to keep it for myself.

50:24.389 --> 50:25.421
           All right!

50:26.357 --> 50:27.757
       Warm it up, guys.

50:27.759 --> 50:31.227
     There you go, Balton.
     Yes, that looks good.

50:32.063 --> 50:33.763
Boys, you know I'll do anything
      for the Steam Room.

50:33.765 --> 50:36.565
    I think I see the line.
  It's just before that stage,

50:36.567 --> 50:39.035
        and I'm definitely
      not ready to cross it.

50:39.037 --> 50:41.537
         Just relax, bro.
      It's going to be fine.

50:41.539 --> 50:44.507
       Just imagine they're
        all muscular women

50:44.509 --> 50:48.377
  with short hair and penises.

50:49.547 --> 50:51.147
     Well, I could do that.

50:54.152 --> 50:54.867
          [Tad] Yeah.

50:54.868 --> 50:55.583
   Shit's about to get weird.

50:56.454 --> 50:58.120
  The rules are simple, kids.

50:58.122 --> 51:02.191
       Make the audience
     happy and win $5,000!

51:03.061 --> 51:04.527
       And take me home!

51:04.529 --> 51:07.513
          No, thanks.

51:07.514 --> 51:10.498
     Oh, nobody wants that.
      All right, play some
    funky music, white boy!

51:11.536 --> 51:12.601
              Oh!

51:12.603 --> 51:14.270
           Oh, sorry.

51:23.548 --> 51:25.114
        It's just water.

51:27.385 --> 51:28.451
             <i> Agua.</i>

51:32.156 --> 51:34.123
              H2O.

51:37.395 --> 51:42.431
  What were you thinking, giving
   your fortune away for a map?

51:43.301 --> 51:45.434
   They're going to kick you
   out of your own company.

51:46.604 --> 51:48.504
        No more empire.

51:49.540 --> 51:53.242
      No money, no Botox.

51:54.145 --> 51:56.412
  No Willie Mammoth, nothing.

51:57.448 --> 52:00.549
 All for the fountain of youth.

52:05.123 --> 52:08.224
 The fountain of youth my ass,

52:08.459 --> 52:09.658
            my old,

52:10.862 --> 52:11.627
             tired,

52:12.597 --> 52:15.664
      somewhat saggy ass.

52:31.516 --> 52:32.681
        I want my mommy.

52:33.351 --> 52:34.350
   Bro, you're the last one.

52:34.352 --> 52:35.684
     You're our only hope.

52:35.686 --> 52:37.219
          Own it, bro.

52:37.221 --> 52:39.372
            Own it?

52:39.373 --> 52:41.524
 Dude, what if I get excited?
 I'm going to pop out of these
 little baby nut huggers, man.

52:41.526 --> 52:44.293
  Think about Old Man Johnson.

52:45.463 --> 52:46.695
      Yeah, that'll do it.

52:47.498 --> 52:48.497
           All right.

52:50.434 --> 52:52.268
        -Yeah! Come on!
            -Go bro!

52:52.270 --> 52:54.737
     Come on, bro. Come on!

52:54.738 --> 52:57.205
    [Billy] We are bringing
 someone in to try and dethrone
     our reigning champion.

52:57.208 --> 53:00.242
      All the way from the
    Midwest, where they grow
  them big, thick, and juicy,

53:00.244 --> 53:02.511
  make some noise for Balton!

53:04.382 --> 53:06.315
      [audience cheering]

53:11.622 --> 53:12.721
       Screw your water.

53:14.592 --> 53:16.358
      Come here, blondie.

53:18.496 --> 53:19.728
     Thank you, Francesca.

53:21.399 --> 53:23.499
            Mm, wow.

53:24.302 --> 53:25.701
           Ooh, yeah.

53:25.703 --> 53:27.469
             Whoa!

53:28.439 --> 53:29.505
           All right!

53:32.476 --> 53:34.577
  Now, that's a dirty martini.

53:34.579 --> 53:36.245
              -Yeah.
   -Unless there's no one else,

53:36.247 --> 53:40.683
    I think we have a brand
    new winner for $5,000!

53:40.685 --> 53:44.486
             -Yes!
         -Yes, Balton!

53:47.758 --> 53:49.325
        I really did it!

53:50.428 --> 53:52.328
     Whoa, what's going on?

53:52.697 --> 53:53.762
             Hello?

53:55.700 --> 53:56.966

 I dedicated my life to beauty.

 just like her when I grew up.

01:05:57.254 --> 01:05:59.387
   Wade's a total mess, bros.

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:02.357
      Neil's no bro, bro.

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:09.497
 If I know Wade, he's probably
 on his third sappy rom-com by
now, wrist deep in cheesy bread.

01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:15.236
 Yeah, hi... I'd like to place
       an order for pizza
       delivery, please.

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:19.307
     Can you tell me about
    the John Travolta? Does
      it come with cheese?

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:25.180
      Oh, it's all cheese?
   What about the Nick Cage?

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:28.717
      I don't really want
         that much ham.

01:06:28.719 --> 01:06:31.386
    How about-- can you tell
  me about the De Niro pizza?

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:37.559
     Wait, wait, hello? You--
      are you talking to me?

01:06:38.362 --> 01:06:39.995
     Are you talking to me?

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:42.063

      You talking to me?

01:06:43.266 --> 01:06:47.202
 Oh, you're not talking to me.
  You know what? Yeah, sorry.

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:48.503
   The De Niro pizza's fine.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:49.571
       That's fine. Yeah.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.273

      Yeah, that ain't going
         to happen, bro.

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:07.489
      Obviously not, bros.

01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:09.124
     Don't sweat it, guys.

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:11.359
     Sally Fay is no match
        for our brains.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:12.494

01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:15.430

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:18.233

         about Sally Fay?

01:07:20.303 --> 01:07:21.302
              Wow.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:23.304
           Hi there.

01:07:23.306 --> 01:07:24.439

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:28.343
      Tres beau, I'd say.

01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:32.380
   Well, I'm a cunnilinguist.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:33.581
              Hmm.

01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:36.251
      As you were saying?

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:37.619
            Oh. Uh.

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:41.089
 Well, apparently, the old bag
     wants our Steam Room.

01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:45.560
      Yeah, and we almost
   lost the contest and five
    big ones because of her.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:47.262
    Yeah, Sally Fay can try.

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:49.497
        But there's no way
      she's getting our gym.

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:52.100
        Hmm, is that so?

01:07:52.803 --> 01:07:55.537
      I've got a bag full
    of cash at my apartment.

01:07:55.539 --> 01:07:59.474
         And we're just
        a few grand away
      from $25,000. So...

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:04.479
  one more of my clever ideas,
  and boom, bye-bye tax bill.

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:09.684
Well, I say we should celebrate
you boys saving the Steam Room.

01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:11.619
   Two whiskies, straight up.

01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:15.190

    a stiff one in his hand.

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:25.466
       Both hands, then.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:27.535

      got his hands full.

        your way with me.

        the bush, Nigel.

01:15:35.265 --> 01:15:37.532
     How much ejaculate do
   you have in you right now?

01:15:38.268 --> 01:15:39.634
           Okay, that's
       what I like to hear.

01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:41.736
        We'll see you down
       there in 10 minutes.

01:15:41.738 --> 01:15:45.606
         -Let's go guys
      Let's go. Let's go.
       -Move it! Come on!

01:16:20.944 --> 01:16:22.710
        [quick flapping]

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:24.845
          [woman] Mmm!

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:35.590
        [man screaming]

01:16:48.738 --> 01:16:50.838
      [machine turning on]

01:16:55.378 --> 01:16:57.011
         [cat meowing]

01:17:00.617 --> 01:17:01.882
         [sheep baaing]

01:17:12.662 --> 01:17:13.694
             Sally?

01:17:16.933 --> 01:17:18.132
             Sally?

01:17:23.006 --> 01:17:24.171
             Sally?

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:28.142
Do you have the water and plant?

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:31.012
          In the car.

01:17:31.381 --> 01:17:33.731
             Good.

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:36.082
        First, the meeting
         with the board.
    Then celebratory shopping.

01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:39.053
Mama needs a brand new handbag.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:58.105
    Soon I will be the richest
       woman in the world.

01:17:59.742 --> 01:18:00.808
  Give me the plant and water.

01:18:01.077 --> 01:18:02.877
    This isn't right, Sally.

01:18:02.879 --> 01:18:05.513
  I can't do this to the guys.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:08.148
     You mean those nitwits
       in the Steam Room?
  I don't have time for this.

01:18:08.151 --> 01:18:09.216
       Just hear me out.

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:12.953
       How about you make
      a deal with Old Man
   Johnson to use the water,

01:18:12.955 --> 01:18:14.755
       and then we can save
         the Steam Room?

01:18:14.757 --> 01:18:16.157
  You're fucking with me now.

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:17.725
       They're good guys.

01:18:17.727 --> 01:18:18.893
       And they like me.

01:18:18.895 --> 01:18:21.829
      Please! They're not
         your friends.

01:18:21.831 --> 01:18:24.899
     I'm your friend and your
      boss, and your family.

01:18:24.901 --> 01:18:26.901
     Without me, you would
          have no one.

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:29.003
     And now you're making
      me late for the most
 important meeting of my life!

01:18:29.005 --> 01:18:30.805
        Give me the damn
        plant and water!

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:32.940
     Not until you promise
    to save the Steam Room.

01:18:36.145 --> 01:18:37.912
       It's a quarter till.
        I'm already late.

01:18:37.914 --> 01:18:39.180
       Promise me, Sally.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:47.321
    Just give me the water,
  and I'll see what I can do.

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:49.990
       Really? Thank you.

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:51.926
        Stay right here.

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:53.060
    I'll be right back down.

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:54.128
        Watch the money.

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:56.514
    I'm not coming with you?

01:18:56.515 --> 01:18:58.098
   I'll talk to the board, then
     you'll take me shopping.

01:18:58.101 --> 01:19:00.000
     Now, hurry up. You've
     already made me late.

01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:03.003
             Hurry.

01:19:21.157 --> 01:19:22.857
             [ding]

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:56.056
I know you don't know who I am.

01:19:56.058 --> 01:19:57.958
 Allow me to introduce myself.

01:19:58.194 --> 01:20:00.261
         I'm Sally Fay!

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:07.168
        I know your mind's
         blown right now.

01:20:07.537 --> 01:20:13.340
      You're thinking this
    gorgeous, young creature
   can't be the experienced,

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:16.143
     older gal we all know
     and love as Sally Fay.

01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:20.815
       But I assure you,
      I am who I say I am.

01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:27.822
     A quick demonstration
     will prove to you that
    I am, indeed, Sally Fay.

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:30.024
           Allow me.

01:20:37.033 --> 01:20:40.201
       I have discovered
     the fountain of youth.

01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:46.073
        And I stand here
  before you as living proof.

01:20:50.947 --> 01:20:52.947
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

01:20:53.382 --> 01:20:54.982
            Exactly!

01:21:12.635 --> 01:21:19.240
  I'll add this miracle water
  to all balms, moisturizers,
 beauty masks, and foundations.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:25.946
    Now, if you'll just sign
    over your shares to me,

01:21:26.649 --> 01:21:30.017
    I'll take control of the
fountain where the water resides

01:21:30.019 --> 01:21:34.421
    and build my new factory
 on top of the miracle spring.

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:38.492
             Sally?

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:41.328
 You gave me a dud plant, Neil.

01:21:42.164 --> 01:21:43.364
         But you said--

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.967
   I said to wait in the car.

01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:50.972
      What about the guys?

01:21:50.973 --> 01:21:53.307
      Sally Fay Cosmetics
    is about winners, Neil.

01:21:54.176 --> 01:21:55.442
       Are you a winner?

01:21:56.979 --> 01:21:57.978
         You promised.

01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.513
  I've had it with you, Neil.

01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:02.216
  You failed to stop the guys.

01:22:02.218 --> 01:22:04.251
     You failed to give me
       the correct plant.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:07.121
    And now, you're failing
      at listening to me.

01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:09.423
    That's it. You're fired.

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:10.925
              Go!

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.360
          But Sally--

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:15.261
      But what, Neil? Why
    do you keep saying but--

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.965
 [gasping] What have you done?

01:22:18.668 --> 01:22:19.533
        What did you do?

01:22:21.137 --> 01:22:23.470
   My beautiful youth-- wait.

01:22:24.173 --> 01:22:25.306
        It's the water.

01:22:25.675 --> 01:22:28.976
It must just last for 24 hours.

01:22:32.348 --> 01:22:33.414
          Don't worry.

01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:35.983
I'll be young again in a minute.

01:22:37.019 --> 01:22:38.152
         This is good.

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.955
    Repeat customers, right?

01:22:42.058 --> 01:22:43.508
            Murmur?

01:22:43.509 --> 01:22:44.959
    Murmur, murmur, murmur.
    Murmur, murmur, murmur.

01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:47.695
      Sally, the board and I
    are in complete agreement.

01:22:47.697 --> 01:22:51.198
     And we've come to the
     conclusion that you're
       goddamn cray-cray.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.300
       I swear, it works.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:57.104
       Send security to the
         conference room.

01:22:57.106 --> 01:23:01.141
      Look, I'm telling you!
  I found the fountain of youth.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:02.209
             Look.

01:23:02.211 --> 01:23:03.410
         This is a map.

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:05.312
       I am living proof.

01:23:05.748 --> 01:23:07.514
  Tell them, Neil. Tell them.

01:23:07.516 --> 01:23:13.087
    Tell them what? That the
  fountain of youth is in the
     Steam Room in Encino?

01:23:13.089 --> 01:23:14.188
              Yes!

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:15.456
          I mean, no.

01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:17.424
 Shh. Shut up, that's a secret.

01:23:21.063 --> 01:23:22.296
         May I, Sally?

01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:24.398
     -They're laughing at me.
           -It's okay.

01:23:25.468 --> 01:23:29.336
Prestigious board, Mr. Brenner,
     can I say a few words?

01:23:30.206 --> 01:23:32.406
  Oh, I'm dying to hear this.

01:23:34.076 --> 01:23:35.309
        She's all yours.

01:23:38.481 --> 01:23:40.547
     You were right, Sally.

01:23:40.549 --> 01:23:42.149
         I was a loser.

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:45.552
  But now it's my time to win.

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:49.089
          Bye, Sally.

01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:54.428
  Oh! You're nothing without me!
      Get your paws off me!

01:23:58.067 --> 01:23:59.299
     [clearing his throat]

01:24:03.339 --> 01:24:04.922
            Come on.

01:24:04.923 --> 01:24:06.506
-Bro, what's taking him so long?
      -I don't know, okay?

01:24:06.509 --> 01:24:08.042
           God, dude.

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:09.777
    Here we go. Here we go.

01:24:09.779 --> 01:24:11.111
         Yeah, finally.

01:24:14.116 --> 01:24:16.150
        Dude, you okay?

01:24:17.086 --> 01:24:17.818
              No.

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:22.322
       After last night and
      today, I could barely
      cross the finish line.

01:24:23.459 --> 01:24:26.193
       Don't look at me.
  I'm a disgrace to my family.

01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:29.596
    All right, well, that's
       the last of them.

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:33.500
        This is for you.

01:24:33.502 --> 01:24:34.501
         You know why.

01:24:35.438 --> 01:24:37.404
          Here you go.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.557
           -Keep it.
       -All right, well,

01:24:39.558 --> 01:24:41.275
    if we're done inseminating
   the entire Western Seaboard,

01:24:41.277 --> 01:24:43.343
     let's go pay the tax man
  and save the Steam Room, okay?

01:24:43.345 --> 01:24:45.279
         -Yeah! Let's go!
          -Let's do it.

01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:48.449
     -Let's do this, guys.
          -All right.

01:24:48.818 --> 01:24:51.085
          Ah! Oh, God.

01:24:51.087 --> 01:24:52.320
            Let me--

01:24:52.321 --> 01:24:53.554
    Don't. Everything hurts.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.827
             Stop!

01:24:59.829 --> 01:25:02.196
         Drop the keys.

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:04.564
      All right, let's go!
  Spread your shit! We're not
  messing around, Mr. Rogers!

01:25:04.567 --> 01:25:07.267
  Balton, take this off, man!
      What are you doing?

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:09.436
       Oh, that's right.
    We nixed the heist plan.

01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:10.404
         That's my bad.

01:25:10.406 --> 01:25:11.438
              -Yeah.
             -My bad.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.473
        Totally forgot.

01:25:12.475 --> 01:25:14.174
     What is this nonsense?

01:25:14.176 --> 01:25:15.642
   This isn't nonsense, sir.

01:25:15.644 --> 01:25:18.846
       This is $5,000 worth
         of fresh sperm.

01:25:18.848 --> 01:25:22.683
      And this is $20,000
         worth of cash.

01:25:25.888 --> 01:25:28.255
    Dude, where's the money?

01:25:29.859 --> 01:25:30.657
         I was robbed.

01:25:30.659 --> 01:25:32.493
         What the hell?

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:35.529
  You ain't have no damn dog.

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:38.732
        It must've been
     that girl last night.

01:25:39.602 --> 01:25:41.869
    All that cash just gone?

01:25:41.871 --> 01:25:43.570
      No more Steam Room.

01:25:45.141 --> 01:25:47.474
       All, so you could
     poke a pink Pop-Tart?

01:25:48.511 --> 01:25:49.877
            -It's--
 -Hey, I don't blame you, man.

01:25:49.879 --> 01:25:51.645
       -I would have did
        the same thing.
              -No.

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:53.380
       Don't commend him.

01:25:53.382 --> 01:25:55.282
      We lost the Steam Room
         because of him!

01:25:56.285 --> 01:25:59.419
     This place is officially
          foreclosed on.

01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:03.524
     Well, boys, you tried.

01:26:03.526 --> 01:26:07.227
      You failed big time,
      but hey, you tried.

01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:10.397
       I got a sore sausage
           for nothing?

01:26:10.399 --> 01:26:12.499
      I bruised my bratwurst
           for bupkis?

01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:15.302
         You made me slam
      my salami for scratch?

01:26:16.539 --> 01:26:18.372
      Nobody nailed their
      knobs for nothing!

01:26:18.908 --> 01:26:20.541
          Neil! What?

01:26:20.543 --> 01:26:22.242
             -Hey!
          -Whoa, dude!

01:26:22.244 --> 01:26:24.344
    Here's the rest of your
        money, 20 large.

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:25.312
     Count it if you want.

01:26:25.314 --> 01:26:28.282
     Boys, looks like your
       debt's been paid.

01:26:28.284 --> 01:26:31.585
       Well, boys, I knew
     I could count on you.

01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:34.421
And you, I'll show you the door.

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:38.425
        -Oh! He's going
     to take you out back!
           -Oh, yeah!

01:26:38.928 --> 01:26:41.261
      -That's the back door!
             -Peace!

01:26:42.731 --> 01:26:45.732
 Where did you get that money,
   man? Where did you get it?

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:48.702
     Sally Fay was my boss.

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:52.539
    She stole it from you so
    that she could implement
 her evil plan to get the gym.

01:26:53.442 --> 01:26:54.675
      That was Sally Fay?

01:26:54.677 --> 01:26:58.445
        You didn't think
     that I would ditch you
    guys and keep the money

01:26:58.447 --> 01:27:00.614
  to start my own billion-dollar
        company, did you?

01:27:01.951 --> 01:27:04.284
      -[clearing his throat]
               -No.

01:27:04.286 --> 01:27:06.253
       I didn't think so.

01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:08.221
      Bros don't do that,
       and you're a bro.

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:12.626
       We'll work on it.

01:27:12.962 --> 01:27:16.363
      -Let's steam, bros!
             -Yeah!

01:27:16.765 --> 01:27:19.800
      All right, you know,
     I'm going to skip out
   on the steam today, guys.

01:27:20.469 --> 01:27:21.468
            Really?

01:27:21.971 --> 01:27:23.370
             -Dude?
             -Yeah.

01:27:23.372 --> 01:27:24.304
              No.

01:27:24.306 --> 01:27:25.889
         No, it's okay.

01:27:25.890 --> 01:27:27.473
   It's all good, and I'll meet
     up with you guys later.

01:27:27.476 --> 01:27:31.378
       I just-- I just have
        some things I need
      to take care of first.

01:27:31.714 --> 01:27:35.449
    Oh, and for the record,
    I definitely would have
    opted to keep the money

01:27:35.451 --> 01:27:38.385
        -to start my own
 multi-billion-dollar company.
-[Ryan] Yeah, that makes sense.

01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:39.753
      You might need this.

01:27:40.623 --> 01:27:41.755
          Thanks, bro.

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:43.390
    Hey, have a good steam.

01:27:43.993 --> 01:27:45.425
         You too, man.

01:27:48.297 --> 01:27:49.396
         Where's Wade?

01:27:51.567 --> 01:27:53.267
       He was just here.

01:27:53.636 --> 01:27:54.635
             Wade?

01:27:56.272 --> 01:27:57.404
             Hello?

01:27:59.475 --> 01:28:00.607
             Wade?

01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:07.748
       Well, I guess it's
   just the three amig-bros.

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:10.284
             Yeah!

01:28:10.719 --> 01:28:12.719
              Woo!

01:28:53.462 --> 01:28:55.796
  -I didn't mean to hurt you.
        -You lied to me.

01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:57.597
         To all of us.

01:28:57.599 --> 01:28:59.599
    I was just doing my job.

01:29:00.402 --> 01:29:02.936
   And what I did was wrong.
      And I really didn't
      want to lie to you.

01:29:10.446 --> 01:29:14.548
     Here, let me tell you
   the full truth, and you're
    going to think I'm nuts.

01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:16.483
       But what the heck?

01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:21.955
          Here's a map
   to the fountain of youth.

01:29:21.957 --> 01:29:26.526
   That's what Sally wanted,
     and it's why she tried
     to get the Steam Room.

01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:30.731
         Anything else?

01:29:34.803 --> 01:29:35.736
             Yeah.

01:29:38.774 --> 01:29:43.443
       I really just wanted
       you to know that I'm
     just a lonely, insecure,

01:29:43.445 --> 01:29:48.548
      Power Rangers nerd who
   just really wants an awesome
    guy like you to like him.

01:29:56.892 --> 01:30:00.894
      Well, then I guess
      it's morphin' time,

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:02.796
        for both of us.

01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:16.009
        It certainly is.

01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:20.747
 I'll come clean with the guys
    and the Steam Room being
     the fountain of youth.

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:24.418
       Oh, it's-- okay, you
        can put that away.

01:30:25.687 --> 01:30:26.686
          Well, but--

01:30:27.489 --> 01:30:28.789
     The guys already know.

01:30:31.527 --> 01:30:36.730
     We've been coming here
together for a long, long time.

01:30:44.807 --> 01:30:48.842
     So, you ready to get
     hot, sticky, and wet?

01:30:49.812 --> 01:30:50.777
             Sure.

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:54.915
  And then after, we can join
  the guys in the steam room.

01:31:29.017 --> 01:31:31.585
        [classic music]

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.060
           [beeping]

01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:09.723
       [knocking on door]

01:32:16.064 --> 01:32:17.697
     Hello, can I help you?

01:32:19.601 --> 01:32:20.534
            For me?

01:32:20.936 --> 01:32:22.002
         Do I know you?

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:23.803
        It's me, Sally.

01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:29.776
            Scrappy?

01:32:32.314 --> 01:32:33.947
       Who's a good boy?

01:32:36.285 --> 01:32:37.551
          [unzipping]

01:32:37.553 --> 01:32:40.654
    [Sally] Oh, now, that's
      what I call a bone.

01:32:45.594 --> 01:32:50.664
    Dude, that was the longest
         episode in Steam
      Room Story's history.

01:32:50.666 --> 01:32:52.832
  Bro, that wasn't an episode.

01:32:52.834 --> 01:32:54.100
       That was a movie!

01:32:54.102 --> 01:32:59.606
   Oh, that would explain why
 no one's telling the audience

01:32:59.608 --> 01:33:02.876

   channel and buy our DVDs.

01:33:04.613 --> 01:33:05.645

         Dude, really?

01:33:09.318 --> 01:33:12.619
   Shameless, just shameless.

01:33:12.621 --> 01:33:13.653
          You know it.

01:33:14.723 --> 01:33:15.789

         <i> ¶ Let's go ¶</i>

01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:22.746
 [man] There you go, like that.

01:33:22.747 --> 01:33:23.763
          -Like that?
      -[man] Give me that.

01:33:23.765 --> 01:33:24.664
         You like that?

01:33:24.666 --> 01:33:26.900
        -Let's do that.
    -[man] That's all I got.

01:33:26.902 --> 01:33:27.867
         Let's do that.

01:33:27.869 --> 01:33:30.136
         [man] Do we need
       to cover you though?

01:33:30.138 --> 01:33:37.344
     No more talking about
      peen, poon, booties,
    motor-boating, rim jobs.

01:33:37.346 --> 01:33:38.211
  [man] Let's go back to one.

01:33:42.818 --> 01:33:44.150
       He went. He went.

01:33:44.152 --> 01:33:45.018
          [man] And--

01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:49.756
How about you pay what the sign
  says there, Obi-Wan Kenobi?

01:33:50.692 --> 01:33:51.958
           [sneezing]

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:52.792
           Bless you.

01:33:53.028 --> 01:33:54.094
           Thank you.

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:55.161
 [Ryan] Okay, I got about $24.

01:33:55.864 --> 01:33:56.830
           That's it.

01:33:57.933 --> 01:33:59.132

         [all laughing]

01:34:13.048 --> 01:34:14.881
    [man] Ah, that's great.

01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:20.670
        [man] All right.

01:34:20.671 --> 01:34:22.921
     I hope you are hungry
       for some sausage.

        [crew laughing]

01:34:28.664 --> 01:34:29.663
             Okay.

01:34:33.769 --> 01:34:35.101
       [man] And we cut.

01:34:36.738 --> 01:34:39.139
       All right, kids, the
      rules are very simple.

01:34:40.676 --> 01:34:44.744
    What are they, actually?
   Don't get hard in public?
      What are the rules?

01:34:44.746 --> 01:34:46.246
       No Willie Mammoth.

01:34:47.416 --> 01:34:49.049
           No Botox.

01:34:49.751 --> 01:34:50.850
            Nothing.

01:34:51.687 --> 01:34:52.285
            Nothing.

01:34:53.422 --> 01:34:55.121
         [bell ringing]

01:34:57.025 --> 01:34:59.826

   -Are you having a good time?
          -[crowd] Whoo!

01:35:09.938 --> 01:35:13.973
All right, kids, I have one more
 surprise from you-- all right?
    I fucking did it again.

01:35:14.776 --> 01:35:17.744
    Don't get angry at me, JC.
   We're not on 35-millimeter.
  I don't want to hear about it.

        here, everybody.

01:35:25.787 --> 01:35:26.786
       Did you see that?

01:35:27.222 --> 01:35:29.055
           Oh my god.

01:35:29.825 --> 01:35:31.257

01:35:33.195 --> 01:35:34.894
  Little boy, can I help you?

         [all laughing]

01:35:38.467 --> 01:35:40.800
      Did you forget what
      bus you're taking?

01:35:50.946 --> 01:35:51.911

01:35:54.282 --> 01:35:56.082
          But Sally--

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:57.883
But what, Neil? What? [gasping]

01:36:00.889 --> 01:36:01.955
           It's you.

01:36:21.076 --> 01:36:26.045
Well, it looks like I'll be able
    to make that Bananarama
    reunion tour after all.
