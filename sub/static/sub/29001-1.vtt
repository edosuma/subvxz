01:20.214 --> 01:22.181
Quick, quick, Tom, look!

01:22.183 --> 01:23.649
What are you doing? Tom, look.

01:24.351 --> 01:25.484
Quick, shoot it.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.354
Yep. Shoot it more. Over here.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.358
Up there,
Up there in your corner.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.594
- On the side. Get on the side.
- Look here.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.695
Yes! Oh.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.697
Over here. Here.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.201
Tom, what are you doing?

01:42.203 --> 01:43.635
Tom! Ugh.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.204
Oh.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.175
Good one.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.644
- What are you...
- Mate, mate, oy.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.112
- Give us the pen.
- Just give me two seconds.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.397
I've just gotta write this down.

01:54.398 --> 01:55.681
- I'm not vandalizing.
- Give me the pen.

01:55.683 --> 01:56.748
Give me the pen.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.817
Just give me two seconds, stop it!

01:58.819 --> 02:01.253
- No, no, no, mate, mate!
- You don't understand!

02:01.255 --> 02:03.155
I'm about to revolutionize science!

02:03.157 --> 02:04.223
Get your hands off me, mate.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.325
The pair of yous.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.593
I'm calling the cops, don't move.

02:10.663 --> 02:11.730
Tom, we've gotta go.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.535
Tom!

03:56.670 --> 03:58.303
<i> What is it that you don't get?</i>

03:58.305 --> 04:00.022
<i> I've already explained.</i>

04:00.023 --> 04:01.740
-<i> Can you simplify it?</i>
-<i> No, I can't simplify it.</i>

04:01.742 --> 04:03.125
<i> It doesn't get</i>
<i> any simpler than that.</i>

04:03.126 --> 04:04.509
<i> I just think</i>
<i> there's gotta be</i>

04:04.511 --> 04:05.819
<i> some kind of</i>
<i> intelligent civilization.</i>

04:05.820 --> 04:07.128
<i> No, no, no,</i>
<i> that's a completely</i>

04:07.129 --> 04:08.437
<i> irrational conclusion</i>
<i> to come to.</i>

04:08.438 --> 04:09.746
<i> It's mathematically</i>
<i> near impossible</i>

04:09.750 --> 04:11.583
<i> that type three</i>
<i> civilizations exist.</i>

04:11.585 --> 04:13.418
<i> It's more likely</i>
<i> that the Dyson sphere</i>

04:13.420 --> 04:14.887
<i> has been created and implemented</i>

04:14.888 --> 04:16.355
-<i> by a type two civilization.</i>

04:16.357 --> 04:17.990
<i> KLG Community Radio.</i>

04:17.992 --> 04:19.909
I have one comment to make.

04:19.910 --> 04:21.827
<i> I read that NASA has</i>
<i> plans to create a Dyson sphere.</i>

04:21.829 --> 04:24.529
Yeah, okay, and if you
believe that, you're an idiot.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.834
Keep your calls coming through
to <i> Tom's Terrestrial Tabloid.</i>

04:28.836 --> 04:30.686
I have a joke for you all.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.537
<i> Einstein developed</i>
<i> a theory about space</i>

04:32.539 --> 04:34.306
<i> and it was about time, too.</i>

04:35.843 --> 04:38.043
<i> You're on</i>
Tom's Terrestrial Tabloid.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.711
Regarding the Fermi paradox.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.913
Do you feel that the great
filter is ahead of us?

04:41.915 --> 04:43.365
<i> It must be.</i>

04:43.366 --> 04:44.816
It's... it's primitive thinking to believe

04:44.818 --> 04:46.818
that Earth is special or one of a kind.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.387
So, yes, it has to be.

04:48.389 --> 04:51.356
Well, with the significant unknown variables,

04:51.358 --> 04:53.825
isn't it just as likely
the great filter is behind us?

04:53.827 --> 04:54.960
<i> We haven't found life.</i>

04:54.962 --> 04:56.595
No life, not even a smidgen of life

04:56.597 --> 04:57.763
anywhere else in the universe.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.464
So, yes, it has to be.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.966
<i> In all honesty,</i>

05:00.968 --> 05:04.670
I find the notion of a great filter unsound.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.039
I find it much more likely

05:07.040 --> 05:09.407
<i> that physical colonization</i>
<i> is a backwards concept</i>

05:09.410 --> 05:11.009
<i> to a more advanced species.</i>

05:11.011 --> 05:12.944
Look, there is a great filter, there has to be.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.497
There's no other viable option.

05:15.498 --> 05:18.049
<i> Unless there's plenty</i>
<i> of noise and activity out there</i>

05:18.052 --> 05:20.419
but our technology is too primitive.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.238
We seem to have lost the caller.

05:23.239 --> 05:24.989
<i> And that looks like</i>
<i> it's a wrap for another week</i>

05:24.992 --> 05:26.658
<i> on Tom's Terrestrial Tabloid.</i>

05:26.660 --> 05:29.094
So be sure to subscribe to the podcast.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.029
Of course, follow me
on all your social media

05:31.031 --> 05:33.899
and remember, watch the skies.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.679
It's my pleasure to share with you all

05:47.681 --> 05:49.815
the potential of what this can do.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.234
Uh, for those who are new,

05:52.235 --> 05:54.652
I'm working on alternative
spectrums of communications.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.622
Specifically, dark radiation.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.459
It is theorized that
dark radiation can offer up--

06:00.461 --> 06:02.894
Sorry, George, the slide.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.364
- Here.
- Oh. No, I've got it.

06:05.366 --> 06:06.431
Um...

06:07.067 --> 06:09.000
Okay, okay.

06:09.002 --> 06:13.472
So I was saying that
dark radiation is theorized

06:13.474 --> 06:16.375
to have a whole new spectrum.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.710
I've been developing the hardware

06:18.712 --> 06:21.446
that will hopefully create and isolate

06:21.448 --> 06:23.014
dark matter materials in a vacuum.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.484
Correct me if I'm wrong.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.052
Isn't this what we saw last year?

06:28.405 --> 06:29.755
- Um...

06:31.158 --> 06:33.091
Well, this...

06:33.093 --> 06:35.026
If this can be developed...

06:35.028 --> 06:37.429
Hang on. "If"?

06:42.969 --> 06:45.403
The issue we have is that
you still don't have anything.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.972
No mockups, beta version.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.707
They don't understand the potential.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.108
But the communications industry,

06:50.110 --> 06:52.477
we can't bank on a potential return

06:52.479 --> 06:53.829
Ten years away.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.180
We tried getting someone in to work with you.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.515
You know that wouldn't work.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.886
We're not renewing your contract.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.921
We've wasted Ten years on this already.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.895
But, hey, I managed to
talk them into allowing you

07:09.897 --> 07:12.931
to continue to research on
this IP in your own time.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.666
But just remember.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.701
We own the rights once you crack it.

07:16.703 --> 07:17.969
We still want this to work.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.805
- "Need" this to work.
- I hate to say it

07:19.807 --> 07:22.140
but I did warn you about this last year.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.145
I don't know, George.
Maybe find something new.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.917
Lots of people find
something meaningful to do

07:31.919 --> 07:33.051
in old age.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.472
Stop staring.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.876
You told me 20 years ago
that you never wanted

07:57.878 --> 08:00.178
to set foot in a classroom again.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.781
Have you looked at
finding another backer?

08:05.519 --> 08:06.585
Not really.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.121
The IP is theirs anyway.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.691
You've worked so hard to get this far.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.926
It'll be a shame to throw it all away now.

08:16.897 --> 08:20.565
Besides, retirement is not
all it's cracked up to be.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.104
I just read an entire book about ants.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.174
Amazingly complex.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.677
You know, there's these explorer ants.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.011
Usually, they get killed.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.982
But they're necessary

08:36.984 --> 08:39.017
for the advancement of the whole colony.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.821
I feel like I've wasted my life.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.257
Amounted to nothing.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.194
Look.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.697
George, look at me.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.134
I know you.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.003
You'll be okay.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.006
You will find your way.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.110
I don't know.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.100
Graham?

10:03.203 --> 10:04.836
You'll never guess.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.237
I'm heading back to the classroom.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.691
Yeah.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.742
Look, can we meet up
at the park Thursday?

10:12.279 --> 10:13.378
Same time.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.082
Shit, I see it's our mistake.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.783
- Doesn't surprise me.
- What?

10:19.386 --> 10:21.086
Surprise me.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.755
Well, let's see what we can find for you.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.290
What's your area?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.258
Science, computer technology.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.961
Got a couple of history classes
I can give you. A half day.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.032
Sorry for the mistake.
Just one of those things.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.703
Can I have some quiet, please?

10:38.705 --> 10:40.488
The rules say if you're not here

10:40.489 --> 10:42.272
in the first 10 minutes
of class, then it's cancelled.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.042
Yeah, class is cancelled.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.461
Well, my watch says

10:46.462 --> 10:48.112
it was meant to start
eight minutes ago.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.681
I'm sorry I'm late.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.751
Girl with the red hair!

10:52.753 --> 10:54.419
Did you just call me
"girl with the red hair"?

10:54.421 --> 10:56.054
I need you all to listen up.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.122
Hey.

10:57.724 --> 10:58.823
Hey.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.291
Don't touch me!

11:00.293 --> 11:01.426
I'm gonna report you.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.942
That's right, walk away.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.683
I thought you were here for the whole day.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.785
Nope, I'm done.

12:27.881 --> 12:28.947
Bugger.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.462
My name is George West,

13:17.464 --> 13:19.097
and for 29 years,

13:19.099 --> 13:21.299
I've been working in computer programming

13:21.301 --> 13:23.034
and experimental physics.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.435
The focus of my career has been

13:24.437 --> 13:27.238
on developing a new form of communication

13:27.240 --> 13:29.974
which to my knowledge,
no one else is researching.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.843
You're in a roomwith
a bunch of other people

13:31.845 --> 13:33.011
all wearing blindfolds.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.813
Everyone is talking over each other

13:34.815 --> 13:36.447
and there is someone
on the other side of the room

13:36.449 --> 13:38.049
that you wanna communicate with.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.450
<i> But you have no hope</i>
<i> of hearing them</i>

13:39.452 --> 13:40.885
<i> above all the noise.</i>

13:41.822 --> 13:44.155
So, what do you do?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.924
You take off the blindfold.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.592
<i> You communicate</i>
<i> using your eyes.</i>

13:47.594 --> 13:49.260
<i> Another sense.</i>

13:49.262 --> 13:50.829
That's essentially what I'm doing.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.932
I'm creating a whole other way
that we can communicate.

13:53.934 --> 13:57.368
Gamma rays, X-ray, UV,
they're all dangerous to us.

13:57.370 --> 14:01.973
My research is looking
at the very real possibility

14:01.975 --> 14:06.244
of there being another spectrum
entirely untapped

14:06.246 --> 14:09.080
that is much larger than
the electromagnetic spectrum.

14:09.082 --> 14:13.351
So if my mobile phone uses microwaves,

14:13.353 --> 14:15.253
could I use it to heat up my food?

14:20.260 --> 14:22.060
So far, my research has been funded

14:22.062 --> 14:24.062
- by a private company.
- Oztel.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.132
Your university is perfectly positioned.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.200
I'm sold.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.905
I was sold before you walked in.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.908
Let's just say I do my homework.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.276
Of course, the university would own

14:38.278 --> 14:40.879
the complete intellectual
rights to this property.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.214
You do own the rights?

14:43.617 --> 14:45.901
Of course.

14:45.902 --> 14:48.186
It'll be a twelve months contract
with quarterly progress reports.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.587
Twelve months?

14:49.589 --> 14:52.123
Consider it a trial.

14:52.125 --> 14:55.059
What would you expect me
to accomplish in one year?

14:56.429 --> 15:00.465
Of course, you can continue
teaching if you prefer.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.522
Graham.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.625
Trudy?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.362
What's happened?

15:35.201 --> 15:37.669
<i> On behalf</i>
<i> of Trudy and the family,</i>

15:37.671 --> 15:40.338
I would like to welcome
you all here today

15:40.340 --> 15:45.610
to this service of remembrance for Graham.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.347
In speaking with Trudy this week,

15:49.349 --> 15:52.283
she reminded me that Graham
was the kind of person

15:52.285 --> 15:57.021
who did well at whatever
he put his hand to.

15:57.023 --> 16:00.658
We're here today, of course,
to mourn his loss.

16:00.660 --> 16:05.596
At the same time, we want
to remember his good qualities.

16:05.598 --> 16:10.101
Each of us has only one life to live.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.371
We each need to think about our legacy.

16:13.373 --> 16:16.708
In what way is the world a better place

16:16.710 --> 16:20.411
as a result of our own contribution?

16:20.413 --> 16:22.680
<i> What will</i>
<i> we remember Graham</i>

16:22.682 --> 16:24.449
<i> for having left behind?</i>

16:26.353 --> 16:27.418
<i> I'm in.</i>

16:30.056 --> 16:31.255
I thought you would be.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.692
There's one other thing.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.462
I know you like to work alone,
but I think it would be wise

16:37.464 --> 16:39.731
With all due respect, I am grateful.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.532
But it really is just a one man

16:41.534 --> 16:42.767
I'm sorry, George, but that's the

16:42.769 --> 16:45.370
But I am someone who works best alone.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.439
Call him your intern.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.507
Plus, given the eight years of work to get where I am

16:49.509 --> 16:50.675
Those are the terms.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.448
Who do you have in mind?

17:09.262 --> 17:11.529
Okay, final question!

17:11.531 --> 17:15.032
The paperboard, also known
as the Chinese takeout box,

17:15.035 --> 17:17.635
was invented in what country?

17:17.637 --> 17:19.737
Uh, I think it was the United States.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.373
Not China?

17:24.243 --> 17:26.277
No. I'm pretty sure it was the U.S.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.585
I don't know, I've never
had Chinese takeout before.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.655
Really?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.091
Well, I'm not Chinese.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.364
Well, maybe we should try it sometime.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.235
Why would they call it Chinese?
It doesn't even make any sense.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.438
Okay, this calls for sudden death

17:53.440 --> 17:55.573
between team Tom and Co.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.775
and Better Late than Pregnant.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.677
Okay, so if you guys can please choose

17:59.679 --> 18:01.079
a representative from the table,

18:01.081 --> 18:02.513
and have them come up
the front, thank you.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.768
Okay, sudden death.

18:06.769 --> 18:09.821
Uh, the first team to get
this wrong is out, okay.

18:09.823 --> 18:11.355
An easy one to start off with here.

18:11.357 --> 18:16.260
Is gravity a force that
pushes objects apart

18:16.262 --> 18:18.196
or pulls them together?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.132
Oh, no help from the floor, please.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.500
What's your answer?

18:22.502 --> 18:24.702
- Pulls them.
- Right, right.

18:24.704 --> 18:25.770
It's neither.

18:25.772 --> 18:29.107
Okay, one of these teams is correct.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.275
Which means that was the final question

18:31.277 --> 18:32.376
for this evening.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.378
So, can we have
a drumroll, please?

18:38.485 --> 18:40.551
The answer is...

18:42.655 --> 18:43.888
it pulls them together.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.290
- Oh! Yes.
- No.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.691
Well done, guys, we'll get you vouchers.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.626
- No wait, you're wrong.
- What?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.394
Chill out, pal.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.896
Gravity is not a force.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.598
It's a consequence of space-time.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.333
Mate, I don't write what's on the cards.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.851
Stop, listen to me.

18:56.852 --> 18:58.368
The mass bends the space-time around it.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.271
- Yeah, take it easy, mate.
- Einstein proved it.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.739
Hey, mate, just take mine.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.206
I don't care about that.
It's not about that.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.176
You guys were wrong, I was right.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.645
Look, you just have to accept
what was on the cards.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.147
- It's done, it's over.
- I'm not coming back.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.415
Hey, I can get you a voucher...

19:11.417 --> 19:12.783
Wait, just calm down.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.634
I have a radio show.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.768
Radio show?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.170
Yeah, it's really good.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.905
I call it,<i>Tom's Terrestrial Tabloid.</i>

19:33.907 --> 19:35.239
It's quite intelligent.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.441
I see.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.545
Budding celebrity scientist.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.131
Yeah.

19:43.132 --> 19:45.416
Yeah, I'll most likely have my
own TV show at some point.

19:45.418 --> 19:48.853
World tours, books, websites, that sort of thing.

19:50.657 --> 19:51.822
Interesting.

19:52.926 --> 19:55.193
I have two PhDs.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.295
One PhD was enough for me.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.730
I suppose that makes me
more educated than you.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.703
So this is it.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.610
What have we got here?

20:12.612 --> 20:15.613
The transmitter and the receiver.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.718
Who's Graham?

20:21.921 --> 20:23.487
An old friend.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.689
You worked together?

20:26.926 --> 20:28.359
Something like that.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.429
Let me show you what I've got.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.435
This is where I get stuck.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.937
I can't get this damn thing
to send the signal

20:39.939 --> 20:43.574
from the transmitter to the receiver.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.678
Fuck off.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.553
<i> First step is creating</i>
<i> a stable transmission</i>

21:29.555 --> 21:32.590
<i> of the signal from the</i>
<i> transmitter to the receiver.</i>

21:32.592 --> 21:33.758
<i> And the end game?</i>

21:33.760 --> 21:35.426
<i> It will completely change</i>

21:35.428 --> 21:37.862
<i> how we communicate</i>
<i> with each other.</i>

21:37.864 --> 21:43.467
<i> E-mail, text, video calls,</i>
<i> all outdated instantly.</i>

21:43.469 --> 21:46.771
<i> If this simple signal can be</i>
<i> sent between these two machines,</i>

21:46.773 --> 21:49.573
<i> then we have proven</i>
<i> that dark radiation exists.</i>

21:51.711 --> 21:53.811
<i> What information</i>
<i> is in the signal?</i>

21:53.813 --> 21:55.313
<i> It's a sine wave.</i>

21:55.315 --> 21:58.382
<i> Instant and near</i>
<i> infinite data transfer</i>

21:58.384 --> 22:00.451
<i> between any two devices.</i>

22:00.453 --> 22:02.320
<i> If we can do it,</i>
<i> the license on the tech</i>

22:02.322 --> 22:04.422
<i> would have to be</i>
<i> billions, right?</i>

22:04.423 --> 22:06.523
<i> Maybe, but let's not</i>
<i> get ahead of ourselves.</i>

22:06.526 --> 22:08.426
- <i> The maths checks out.</i>
- <i> It's not stable.</i>

22:08.428 --> 22:09.927
<i> Then push it harder.</i>

22:14.701 --> 22:16.434
<i> In my last video, I told you</i>

22:16.436 --> 22:18.803
<i> that I was starting</i>
<i> to research dark radiation.</i>

22:18.805 --> 22:20.971
<i> This new form</i>
<i> of digital communication</i>

22:20.973 --> 22:22.973
<i> has limitless implications</i>
<i> for the tech</i>

22:22.975 --> 22:24.759
<i> and communication industries.</i>

22:24.760 --> 22:26.544
<i> Make sure</i>
<i>you don't put this on the radio</i>

22:26.546 --> 22:27.712
<i> or anywhere else.</i>

22:27.714 --> 22:29.380
<i> Not until we know what we have.</i>

22:36.622 --> 22:38.656
<i> I found</i>
<i> your YouTube channel.</i>

22:38.658 --> 22:40.758
It'll grow, I've only just started.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.593
Six subscribers.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.428
Any attention's better than none.

22:45.431 --> 22:46.764
You have to take it down.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.700
- What, why?
- Take it down.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.936
We don't know what we have yet.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.538
- What do you mean?
- We need more testing.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.709
Don't be ignorant.
This is science.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.078
- Just take it down, all right?
- All right.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.419
It can't be from anything else, right?

23:09.422 --> 23:10.788
So let's try again.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.023
Hang on.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.395
I know this.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.096
<i> I once estimated</i>
<i> the curvature of the universe</i>

23:19.098 --> 23:21.432
<i> using the predicated</i>
<i> matter density at the time.</i>

23:21.434 --> 23:23.284
<i> They should give us</i>
<i> the ability to send</i>

23:23.285 --> 23:25.135
<i> a dark radiation signal</i>
<i> the distance required</i>

23:25.138 --> 23:26.837
<i> from the transmitter</i>
<i> to the receiver.</i>

23:34.147 --> 23:35.413
Try that.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.093
We have dark radiation.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.028
The future ain't what it used to be.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.632
- Hey, princess.
- This is Alicia.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.968
Oh, nice to meet you.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.137
You know, you should
have introduced us, Tom.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.972
All right, let's start.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.010
Did you hear about
Marian's new book deal?

24:06.012 --> 24:07.178
It got read by Penguin.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.180
Said it should get picked up.

24:09.182 --> 24:11.366
It's kind of a big deal.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.551
Yeah, but you haven't signed
any contracts yet.

24:13.553 --> 24:15.920
Well, no, not yet.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.155
You know I'm working on
some pretty interesting stuff

24:18.157 --> 24:19.490
at the moment.

24:19.491 --> 24:20.824
Oh, yeah, you've got
that internship, haven't you?

24:20.827 --> 24:22.226
Well, I hope they're going to give you

24:22.228 --> 24:23.794
a well-paying job at the end of it.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.763
It's not about the money.

24:25.764 --> 24:27.731
Well, I'm just saying you
have to be responsible.

24:27.733 --> 24:29.200
You've got other people to think of.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.101
You know, this work I'm
doing at the moment,

24:31.103 --> 24:33.204
it's, uh, it's pretty big.

24:33.206 --> 24:34.939
Do you remember when
Tom made that watch

24:34.941 --> 24:36.707
and you stuck the speaker to it?

24:36.709 --> 24:38.242
Do you remember that?
And the microphone?

24:38.244 --> 24:39.777
- When did he do that?

24:39.779 --> 24:41.512
Hello? Hello?

24:41.514 --> 24:44.748
He never did get that ear-piece
happening, did he?

24:44.750 --> 24:45.983
Everyone walking around with their wrists

24:45.985 --> 24:47.451
stuck to their ears.

24:47.452 --> 24:48.918
Hello? Wait, I can't hear you!

24:51.691 --> 24:52.823
He's having fun, isn't he?

24:57.029 --> 24:58.496
Just take a joke, Tom.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.669
You know what I don't get?

25:05.671 --> 25:06.971
How you all support Marian

25:06.973 --> 25:08.556
and her little book writing thing

25:08.557 --> 25:10.140
which, let's be honest, is
probably gonna go nowhere.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.475
- Tom.
- I mean, how many writers

25:11.476 --> 25:12.809
are out there thinking they're
gonna break through?

25:12.812 --> 25:14.712
But none of you, not
a single one of you,

25:14.714 --> 25:16.180
know anything about what I'm doing.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.647
You've always thought that
you were better than us

25:17.650 --> 25:19.183
and smarter than us.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.684
Yeah.

25:20.686 --> 25:21.752
'Cause I am.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.021
Come on, let's go.

25:40.606 --> 25:43.207
So, what's the announcement strategy?

25:43.209 --> 25:45.576
I think I'll hold off on that for a bit.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.580
I've had some stuff published online before.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.950
- As I just said..
- I'm just...

25:52.952 --> 25:55.319
I'm saying, what's the point if
we just keep it to ourselves?

26:01.294 --> 26:02.893
What's your plan?

26:02.895 --> 26:04.562
The proper procedures, Tom.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.631
We continue testing.

26:07.633 --> 26:10.334
We cross check, make
sure all claims are backed

26:10.336 --> 26:13.337
with multiple verified sources
and first-hand results.

26:13.339 --> 26:16.106
We get an independent
third party to verify.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.341
But we do it right.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.944
And eventually, we
release it into a journal.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.345
- A journal?
- We are at...

26:21.347 --> 26:23.714
For what, three academics to read?

26:23.716 --> 26:25.115
No, fuck that. It's outdated,

26:25.117 --> 26:26.250
and everything gets leaked online

26:29.855 --> 26:31.422
before announcement these days.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.990
At the moment, we have control
over how the story gets shared.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.959
I have a strategy that'll
give us maximum exposure

26:34.961 --> 26:36.260
Hold up, hold up!

26:37.296 --> 26:39.229
This isn't a publicity stunt.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.031
All we've been able to do so far

26:41.033 --> 26:43.867
is send and receive a signal
two meters across the room.

26:43.869 --> 26:45.302
Anything we claim,

26:45.304 --> 26:48.639
respected scientists are going
to try and prove wrong.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.108
We must be watertight.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.977
And they will come at it
from every angle.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.278
Well, fuck them.

26:54.280 --> 26:57.381
No, Tom, we don't.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.316
We could sell what we have
to a tech company

26:59.318 --> 27:00.918
right now for millions.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.653
- Let me tell you a story.
- Your stories suck.

27:02.655 --> 27:03.787
Well, you're going to listen.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.258
I spent six years workingat Wittcom.

27:08.260 --> 27:11.061
We developed wireless charging
for mobile devices,

27:11.063 --> 27:14.064
batteries, phones, prototypes.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.232
We had them.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.101
And then my partner, my...

27:18.270 --> 27:19.770
He took pictures.

27:20.339 --> 27:21.839
He posted them online.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.407
The media mocked how they looked

27:23.409 --> 27:25.709
because they were ugly prototypes.

27:25.711 --> 27:27.244
So we rushed the launch.

27:27.246 --> 27:30.047
We didn't do enough testing,
the batteries caught fire.

27:30.049 --> 27:32.349
Over 20 people got
third-degree burns.

27:32.351 --> 27:35.085
They only spent three months
on the shelves, so no!

27:35.087 --> 27:37.187
I am not going to rush this.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.697
You finish calibrating.

28:30.409 --> 28:33.043
You need to come back, now.

28:41.787 --> 28:43.854
Tell me exactly what happened.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.355
- Well, I..
- Wait a second.

28:47.993 --> 28:49.460
You're recording?

28:49.462 --> 28:51.229
What happened?

28:51.230 --> 28:52.997
Well, I was about to
shut down the receiver

28:52.998 --> 28:54.765
and I just angled it this way
and it was facing the window

28:54.767 --> 28:56.166
- and then all of a..
- Don't touch it.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.182
What's it picking up?

29:13.853 --> 29:15.919
That filled up in, like, half a second.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.241
<i> We've got</i>
<i> verifiable evidence</i>

29:37.243 --> 29:39.260
<i> of a stable transmission signal</i>

29:39.261 --> 29:41.278
<i> in a previously theoretical</i>
<i> energy spectrum in the lab.</i>

29:41.280 --> 29:43.881
<i> However, today,</i>
<i> we briefly received a signal</i>

29:43.883 --> 29:46.283
<i> originating from outside</i>
<i> the lab instantly filling up</i>

29:46.285 --> 29:47.885
<i> our hard drives.</i>

29:47.886 --> 29:49.486
<i> The source of the signal</i>
<i> is currently unknown</i>

29:49.487 --> 29:51.087
<i> as the receiver</i>
<i> was accidentally pointing</i>

29:51.090 --> 29:52.189
<i> towards the sky,</i>

29:52.191 --> 29:53.957
<i> but further tests to come.</i>

29:56.395 --> 29:57.828
<i> So quick update.</i>

29:57.829 --> 29:59.262
<i> We realized the receiver</i>
<i> needed focusing</i>

29:59.265 --> 30:00.614
<i> which we've modified</i>

30:00.615 --> 30:01.964
<i> and that we needed</i>
<i> to track the source</i>

30:01.967 --> 30:03.517
<i> as it moves across</i>
<i> the skies.</i>

30:03.518 --> 30:05.068
<i> So tonight's the test</i>
<i> to see if we can track</i>

30:05.070 --> 30:05.969
<i> this moving signal.</i>

30:13.913 --> 30:15.245
And now we wait.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.384
Tell me.

30:20.386 --> 30:23.020
You have a lot of education.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.589
How is it that you haven't found
the right vocation yet?

30:32.264 --> 30:34.198
I don't really do well with people.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.401
I mean you're okay.

30:37.403 --> 30:40.170
Your positives outweigh your negatives, but...

30:40.172 --> 30:43.207
most people, they just get in my way.

30:44.877 --> 30:47.411
My second PhD, they tried to stop me.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.546
I was trying to disprove Einstein.

30:49.548 --> 30:50.614
Could you?

30:53.252 --> 30:54.418
He's a tough man to beat.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.422
For me...

31:00.626 --> 31:03.927
I always wanted to contribute
in some kind of way.

31:03.929 --> 31:06.163
Some say they find that in having kids.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.298
I have a son.

31:10.603 --> 31:12.569
We don't really have much contact.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.105
Nothing happened, we just...

31:16.041 --> 31:17.207
We just don't talk.

31:18.043 --> 31:20.461
I guess, at some point,

31:20.462 --> 31:22.880
this work just became more important to me.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.017
You found what was more important.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.020
There'll always be plenty of people

31:30.022 --> 31:31.421
but not many worth remembering.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.103
Clear line of sight.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.108
Receiving.

31:53.112 --> 31:54.912
We found it.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.179
We found the source.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.416
Who are they?

32:17.036 --> 32:18.936
- Catherine.
- George.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.408
First of all, I need 100% assurance

32:24.410 --> 32:27.678
that this conversation stays between us.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.646
Of course.

32:29.648 --> 32:34.418
If I gave you a code, a signal, a waveform.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.719
Could you decipher it?

32:58.243 --> 32:59.643
I think there might be a story.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.011
I really think the newspapers

33:01.013 --> 33:02.312
are gonna be really interested in this.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.648
- Wow.
- Hello. Can I help you?

33:05.484 --> 33:06.984
Hi, I'm Monique.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.286
George.

33:09.288 --> 33:10.354
What brings you here?

33:10.356 --> 33:12.689
I saw a clip of Tom's, actually,

33:12.691 --> 33:14.458
of some really cool science stuff.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.159
It looks really interesting.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.594
I think there might be a story here.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.129
Actually, I'd prefer we didn't.

33:19.131 --> 33:21.131
Oh, maybe we can find another time

33:21.133 --> 33:23.333
that suits all of us.

33:23.335 --> 33:26.203
We don't have much
to report on at the moment

33:26.205 --> 33:28.005
but if you wanna leave
your name, details.

33:28.007 --> 33:30.391
Look, if you're willing,

33:30.392 --> 33:32.776
I'd be really excited to write
something up on my website.

33:32.778 --> 33:35.112
I'm sorry, I didn't catch
who you work for.

33:35.114 --> 33:38.515
I freelance to various media outlets.

33:40.085 --> 33:42.085
As I said, we'll let you know.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.269
What was that about?

34:01.540 --> 34:03.473
I don't know.
She just dropped by.

34:04.410 --> 34:05.642
What was she doing here?

34:06.578 --> 34:08.378
I said I don't know.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.547
- What did you tell her?
- I didn't say anything.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.216
She said you were telling her about..

34:13.217 --> 34:15.268
I didn't say anything specific.

34:15.268 --> 34:17.319
I was just using big words
she wouldn't understand.

34:17.322 --> 34:18.554
Until she Googles them!

34:23.195 --> 34:25.429
Not a word to anybody.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.630
Understand?

34:29.735 --> 34:30.801
Sure.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.623
So here it is.

34:57.729 --> 34:59.096
It's intelligent.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.200
We found intelligent life.

35:16.548 --> 35:19.116
Given the nature of what
we're dealing with,

35:19.118 --> 35:20.417
we need to be sensitive

35:20.419 --> 35:22.352
with what we share with other people.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.421
So it would be better for everyone

35:25.457 --> 35:27.591
if you fill this in.

35:27.593 --> 35:28.692
What's this?

35:28.694 --> 35:30.127
University requirements.

35:30.662 --> 35:31.761
Have you signed one?

35:32.698 --> 35:34.131
It's a little different for me

35:34.133 --> 35:37.200
given that it was my project to begin with.

35:37.202 --> 35:39.569
I'll have a look over it and get back to you.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.571
I might get you to fill that in right now

35:41.573 --> 35:42.639
if you don't mind.

35:46.578 --> 35:49.312
There's another favor
I need to ask you.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.314
I need the lab to myself for a few days.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.449
Why?

35:53.152 --> 35:55.252
Just to do some coding.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.854
I can stay out of your way.
I'll just put my headphones in.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.623
I can't have you here.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.191
I can't say any more than that.

36:39.631 --> 36:40.697
Can I help you?

36:41.300 --> 36:42.566
Hi, I'm Alicia.

36:43.936 --> 36:45.202
Tom's girlfriend.

36:46.605 --> 36:47.904
Is he here?

36:47.906 --> 36:49.639
I let him knock off early.

36:49.641 --> 36:50.740
Oh, he didn't tell me.

36:52.945 --> 36:54.778
I bought Chinese takeaway.

36:56.281 --> 36:58.582
Oh, well, I'll find him at home, I guess.

37:01.954 --> 37:04.621
I heard Monique dropped by today.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.891
- The journalist?
- Hopefully one day.

37:07.893 --> 37:08.959
If someone gives her a job.

37:09.828 --> 37:10.894
Tom knows her?

37:10.896 --> 37:12.562
Yeah, since high school.

37:14.499 --> 37:17.267
You know, he really loves it here.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.735
Is that right?

37:18.737 --> 37:20.003
It's all he ever talks about.

37:21.473 --> 37:22.706
He'd never admit it,

37:22.708 --> 37:25.008
but he actually really respects you.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.977
Oh, well.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.480
Thank you.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.982
That's very kind of you.

37:33.619 --> 37:34.985
Anyway...

37:36.588 --> 37:37.721
Bye.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.581
That reporter seemed nice.

38:04.583 --> 38:05.782
Yeah, I guess.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.484
You haven't heard from her again?

38:07.486 --> 38:08.585
No.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.353
Tom.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.322
- I know you know her.
- What?

38:12.324 --> 38:15.392
Let me make one thing positively clear.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.927
We have something truly extraordinary.

38:17.929 --> 38:20.497
It is just you and me who have it.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.966
We need to be absolutely prudent
with our handling of this.

38:22.968 --> 38:26.403
If we make one wrong move,
we jeopardize everything.

38:26.405 --> 38:28.355
How long do you expect me to wait?

38:28.356 --> 38:30.306
We have received 50 terabytes of information

38:30.309 --> 38:33.410
never before heard by anyone
in the history of humankind.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.028
Hold on.

38:35.029 --> 38:36.645
All we have is a scattered signal of white noise.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.349
- Right?

38:41.420 --> 38:43.086
I have something to show you.

38:46.325 --> 38:47.691
Holy fuck.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.993
Yup.

38:49.995 --> 38:53.330
Everything about the universe.

38:53.332 --> 38:56.566
Quantum mechanics, inorganic chemistry.

38:56.568 --> 38:59.002
Metaphysics, everything.

39:00.105 --> 39:01.838
And we're only getting started.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.909
You kept this from me?

39:05.911 --> 39:08.011
You wanna talk about trust
and honesty and confidence..

39:08.013 --> 39:09.446
Don't start.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.582
I have to go.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.416
But we can talk more about this when I get back.

39:14.419 --> 39:16.820
You know, there are others out
there researching this, too.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.556
What do you mean?

39:19.558 --> 39:20.890
We're not the only ones.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.060
Monique told me about some group in Belgium

39:24.062 --> 39:26.096
that are exploring this, too.

39:26.098 --> 39:28.832
Except they don't have stable dark radiation yet.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.100
It's not a race.

39:30.102 --> 39:31.835
But we can talk more when I get back.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.737
It is a race.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.939
No one's gonna care if we come second.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.941
And you're just casually holding the...

39:38.710 --> 39:41.478
Do you know what?

39:41.480 --> 39:43.446
I just can't fucking believe you wouldn't tell me,

39:43.448 --> 39:44.748
and you're just sitting on this like no one

39:44.750 --> 39:46.616
could beat us to it.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.651
Well, you're not helping with
that radio show either.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.023
This is fucked.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.630
<i> It's pretty mind blowing.</i>

40:00.632 --> 40:02.148
<i> And it makes me wonder,</i>

40:02.149 --> 40:03.665
<i> did all the greatest scientists</i>
<i> know what they had</i>

40:03.668 --> 40:05.652
<i> when they made</i>
<i> their discoveries?</i>

40:05.653 --> 40:07.637
<i> I mean, did they really grasp</i>
<i> what they had</i>

40:07.639 --> 40:09.206
<i> and what to do with it?</i>

40:09.207 --> 40:10.774
<i> That's what</i>
<i> we've gotta figure out.</i>

40:10.776 --> 40:13.576
<i> Anyway, that's a wrap for</i>
<i> Tom's Terrestrial Tabloid.</i>

40:13.578 --> 40:15.812
<i> So be sure to subscribe</i>
<i> to the podcast.</i>

40:15.814 --> 40:17.580
<i> Follow me</i>
<i> on all your social media</i>

40:17.582 --> 40:19.816
<i> and remember, watch the skies.</i>

40:28.860 --> 40:29.993
I found something.

40:33.565 --> 40:34.631
I got mice.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.466
Perfect.

40:54.719 --> 40:56.653
And what are we gonna
teach him, Professor X?

40:56.655 --> 40:58.121
Problem solving skills.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.590
And what does that look like in mice?

41:02.994 --> 41:05.762
I honestly don't know.

41:05.764 --> 41:08.097
It's definitely reversible, isn't it?

41:08.099 --> 41:10.667
Theoretically, we can extract the information.

41:14.506 --> 41:16.139
Here we go.

41:42.534 --> 41:43.700
Too much?

41:46.137 --> 41:47.670
Let's find out.

41:51.209 --> 41:52.275
Ready?

42:08.527 --> 42:09.792
It's working.

42:09.794 --> 42:11.794
We actually made it smarter.

42:12.831 --> 42:13.897
Next level.

42:16.568 --> 42:18.001
Human testing.

42:18.003 --> 42:19.936
Don't even think about it.

42:19.938 --> 42:22.171
It's too much for an adult.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.073
The brain would need to be malleable.

42:25.076 --> 42:26.276
Like a child.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.750
So what I need right now is
to get this information out

42:33.752 --> 42:34.951
to as many people as possible.

42:36.655 --> 42:38.588
Right now, you have no followers.

42:41.126 --> 42:44.060
Yeah. I have been doing all the right things.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.895
You know, I post at the right times,

42:45.897 --> 42:47.497
I hashtag,

42:47.498 --> 42:49.098
I'm across all different
social media channels.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.567
It's just not working.

42:50.569 --> 42:51.834
I can help you with that, I promise.

42:51.836 --> 42:52.936
That's what I'm here for.

42:58.109 --> 43:01.110
So, um, what's Alicia up to?

43:01.780 --> 43:02.845
Uh...

43:04.749 --> 43:06.316
She's working, I think.

43:06.318 --> 43:09.652
Is she the type of person
that would be weird about this?

43:10.221 --> 43:11.788
About what?

43:11.790 --> 43:14.891
You know, us hanging out...

43:15.627 --> 43:16.726
alone.

43:18.363 --> 43:19.629
Mmm.

43:21.600 --> 43:24.334
I would really love to write this story.

43:24.336 --> 43:26.636
Give me a chance to put my uni debt to use.

43:27.672 --> 43:29.172
You really want it, don't you?

43:31.743 --> 43:33.309
Give me something to write about.

43:36.715 --> 43:37.981
<i> Okay, so it's just</i>
<i> a small amount</i>

43:37.983 --> 43:39.082
<i> of data to begin with.</i>

43:39.084 --> 43:40.967
<i> Only 0.3 megabytes.</i>

43:40.968 --> 43:42.851
<i> It shouldn't have too much</i>
<i> of a meaningful effect.</i>

45:04.903 --> 45:06.035
Let me guess.

45:07.005 --> 45:08.705
Not the usual short black.

45:11.142 --> 45:12.975
Tea.

45:12.977 --> 45:15.278
You ordered an herbal tea.

45:15.280 --> 45:19.782
Let me see, lemongrass, no, peppermint, chamomile,

45:19.784 --> 45:21.784
dandelion, ginger.

45:21.786 --> 45:23.419
You ordered a ginger tea.

45:23.421 --> 45:25.855
Well, you'll have to wait and see.

45:25.857 --> 45:27.857
What's happened is you've
experienced some success

45:27.859 --> 45:29.192
which has increased your confidence

45:29.194 --> 45:30.927
therefore allowing you the mental freedom

45:30.929 --> 45:32.328
to take risks, even if it's as minute

45:32.330 --> 45:34.330
as sampling an untried hot beverage.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.040
Have you ever wondered how what you do

45:44.042 --> 45:45.942
affects other people around you?

45:49.080 --> 45:51.114
One hundred years after you're dead,

45:53.518 --> 45:54.884
no one will know you.

45:58.990 --> 46:00.156
Tom.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.326
- The internet.
- What?

46:03.328 --> 46:05.328
That's why we have the internet.

46:07.132 --> 46:08.364
Ginger tea.

46:08.366 --> 46:09.432
Thank you.

46:15.974 --> 46:19.075
Can you imagine what we could
do with this information?

46:19.077 --> 46:22.879
We own the first recorded signal
from an intelligent life.

46:22.881 --> 46:24.280
We could cure diseases,

46:24.282 --> 46:26.783
we could achieve time
dilating space travel,

46:26.785 --> 46:28.384
teleportation, immortality.

46:29.154 --> 46:30.953
Maybe.

46:30.955 --> 46:32.522
But that doesn't mean we should.

46:50.341 --> 46:51.407
Don't.

47:06.825 --> 47:07.990
It's been a while.

47:09.494 --> 47:11.160
<i> Where are we up to?</i>

47:11.162 --> 47:13.129
Well, you know what they say.

47:13.131 --> 47:16.265
<i> A thousand errors</i>
<i> for one success.</i>

47:16.267 --> 47:18.401
Going through all the necessary processes.

47:19.270 --> 47:20.903
<i> A thousand errors?</i>

47:22.106 --> 47:23.472
Is that a science term?

47:23.474 --> 47:25.208
I don't know.

47:25.210 --> 47:27.343
I thought it was well-known.

47:28.012 --> 47:29.178
I guess not.

47:30.381 --> 47:31.948
<i> And Tom?</i>

47:31.950 --> 47:33.883
<i> How's he doing?</i>

47:33.885 --> 47:36.152
Working well between you two?

47:36.154 --> 47:38.554
<i> He's been very useful.</i>

47:38.556 --> 47:41.324
<i> Provided valuable</i>
<i> insight and help.</i>

47:42.594 --> 47:44.227
Two heads are better than one.

47:45.463 --> 47:48.297
<i> Tell me.</i>

47:48.298 --> 47:51.132
Why did you assign Tom as
opposed to anyone else?

47:51.135 --> 47:53.102
<i> He's been</i>
<i> at the university</i>

47:53.104 --> 47:56.305
in some way, shape, or form
for a while now.

47:56.307 --> 47:57.473
We recognized his brilliance

47:57.475 --> 47:59.475
even back when he was an undergrad.

47:59.477 --> 48:02.645
I was a little worried we might lose him.

48:02.647 --> 48:04.513
<i> And you need</i>
<i> someone to work with.</i>

48:08.286 --> 48:09.418
So far, so good.

48:48.126 --> 48:50.559
<i> I've realized,</i>
<i> looking at the world around me,</i>

48:50.561 --> 48:53.462
<i> that no one gets it.</i>

48:53.464 --> 48:56.299
<i> No one can see the true reality</i>
<i> of what's going on</i>

48:56.301 --> 48:58.935
<i> or their role within it.</i>

48:58.937 --> 49:02.305
<i> I look around at the world</i>
<i> and all I see are...</i>

49:02.307 --> 49:04.473
<i> I wouldn't even</i>
<i> call them machines.</i>

49:06.277 --> 49:08.511
<i> Machines, at least,</i>
<i> are intentionally designed</i>

49:08.513 --> 49:09.946
<i> and serve a purpose.</i>

49:11.950 --> 49:14.083
<i> People are purely</i>
<i> acting out the actions</i>

49:14.085 --> 49:16.152
<i> based upon</i>
<i> their physical makeups.</i>

49:18.456 --> 49:21.424
<i> The idea of free will</i>
<i> can finally be put to rest.</i>

49:21.426 --> 49:24.393
<i> Cause and effect</i>
<i> explains it all.</i>

49:24.395 --> 49:26.429
<i> Complete determinism.</i>

49:26.431 --> 49:28.397
<i> But their idea of cause</i>
<i> and subsequent effect</i>

49:28.399 --> 49:31.167
<i> is infantile at best.</i>

49:31.169 --> 49:33.736
<i> The role they play</i>
<i> is no longer necessary.</i>

49:35.006 --> 49:37.006
<i> These machines are obsolete.</i>

49:42.647 --> 49:45.715
<i> Everyone's actions are merely</i>
<i> a result of something.</i>

49:48.252 --> 49:49.518
<i> And now,</i>

49:51.556 --> 49:54.090
<i> I understand my role</i>
<i> in this system.</i>

50:10.541 --> 50:12.708
I've got something to show you.

50:12.710 --> 50:14.076
- Yeah?
- Mm.

50:26.424 --> 50:27.556
Really?

51:07.465 --> 51:10.332
<i> The colony</i>
<i> is under extreme danger</i>

51:10.334 --> 51:12.334
<i> with all the ant's lives</i>
<i> at risk.</i>

51:12.336 --> 51:15.237
<i> The host ants</i>
<i> require serious action</i>

51:15.239 --> 51:19.708
<i> to prevent the entire colony</i>
<i> from complete extermination.</i>

51:19.710 --> 51:21.777
<i> Under these extreme</i>
<i> circumstances,</i>

51:21.779 --> 51:25.214
<i> ants can sabotage</i>
<i> and destroy their own nest</i>

51:25.216 --> 51:28.150
<i> for the greater good</i>
<i> of the colony.</i>

51:37.695 --> 51:39.195
Einstein was wrong.

51:53.578 --> 51:55.544
Are you gonna tell me
where you were last night?

52:02.587 --> 52:03.819
Einstein was wrong.

52:05.256 --> 52:07.223
Where were you?

52:07.225 --> 52:09.825
More importantly, Einstein was wrong.

52:11.429 --> 52:12.828
Where were you?

52:14.432 --> 52:15.664
I was with Monique.

52:16.467 --> 52:17.800
Now, my book.

52:21.506 --> 52:24.140
<i> I'm about to share with you</i>
<i> the secrets of the universe</i>

52:24.142 --> 52:25.774
<i> that will revolutionize</i>
<i> your worldview.</i>

52:25.776 --> 52:27.910
<i> We live in a universe</i>
<i> of 29 dimensions</i>

52:27.912 --> 52:29.678
<i> defined by the path</i>
<i> integral quantization</i>

52:29.680 --> 52:31.780
<i> of the two dimensional actions</i>
<i> of the conformal field.</i>

52:31.782 --> 52:33.883
<i> The field in the world view</i>
<i> describes the embedding</i>

52:33.885 --> 52:35.885
<i> of the string 28 plus one</i>
<i> space-time dimensions.</i>

52:35.887 --> 52:37.920
<i> I will then prove to you</i>
<i> that we live in a multi-verse</i>

52:37.922 --> 52:39.272
<i> in which the physical world,</i>

52:39.273 --> 52:40.623
<i> specifically,</i>
<i> the level three multiverse</i>

52:40.625 --> 52:42.191
<i> is the mathematical structure.</i>

53:32.810 --> 53:33.876
Excuse me.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.220
Paul.

53:44.222 --> 53:46.255
You cheating fuck!

53:46.257 --> 53:47.389
You thought you'd get away with it

53:47.391 --> 53:48.591
and we'd never know?

53:48.593 --> 53:50.960
Hang on a second. You fired me.

53:50.962 --> 53:52.828
I haven't sold anything.

53:52.830 --> 53:54.797
You know you could go to jail.

53:54.799 --> 53:57.566
<i> You gave our IP</i>
<i> to the university.</i>

53:57.568 --> 53:59.768
<i> You need to come in</i>
<i> and fix this, George.</i>

53:59.770 --> 54:01.620
- <i> Now.</i>
- All right.

54:01.621 --> 54:03.471
<i> Let me sort it out,</i>
<i> and I'll get back to you.</i>

54:12.283 --> 54:14.016
Have a good show, I'll tune in.

54:30.668 --> 54:32.768
Oh.

54:32.769 --> 54:34.869
You've just missed Tom.
He's gone to do his radio show.

54:35.673 --> 54:36.772
Has Tom told you?

54:37.642 --> 54:39.341
He doesn't tell me much.

54:41.412 --> 54:43.445
Yeah, I figured he wouldn't tell you, so...

54:45.650 --> 54:47.549
We're separating.

54:47.551 --> 54:48.684
Oh.

54:56.327 --> 54:57.660
It's perfect timing, right?

54:59.297 --> 55:00.362
What's the issue?

55:01.832 --> 55:03.599
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

55:03.601 --> 55:05.701
Yeah, I shouldn't have said anything.

55:05.703 --> 55:08.704
Just go easy on him.

55:08.706 --> 55:10.739
He's gonna need someone like you.

55:11.542 --> 55:12.608
Bye, George.

56:29.153 --> 56:30.886
I have a question for Tom.

56:30.888 --> 56:33.088
Oh, we have another caller.

56:33.090 --> 56:34.890
<i> You remember</i>
<i> that form you signed?</i>

56:35.459 --> 56:36.525
George.

56:36.527 --> 56:37.793
<i> Yep.</i>

56:37.795 --> 56:39.461
<i> The non-disclosure agreement?</i>

56:39.463 --> 56:41.063
Ah, perhaps you had a science question.

56:41.065 --> 56:43.015
No.

56:43.016 --> 56:44.966
You do realize that you are not meant to talk about

56:44.969 --> 56:47.569
anything about our research to anyone?

56:47.571 --> 56:49.037
<i> Yes.</i>

56:49.039 --> 56:50.939
Even your girlfriend?

56:50.941 --> 56:53.542
Her eyes just glaze over at this stuff anyway.

56:53.544 --> 56:55.177
-<i> And online.</i>
- Obviously.

56:55.179 --> 56:56.678
Or on YouTube!

56:58.115 --> 56:59.392
<i> Let me send you a link</i>

56:59.393 --> 57:00.670
<i> to something</i>
<i> I found interesting.</i>

57:00.671 --> 57:01.948
Ah, let's go to another song, shall we?

57:16.834 --> 57:18.434
Why would you do that to me?

57:18.436 --> 57:19.501
Did you get my e-mail?

57:23.707 --> 57:25.791
Can you see me?

57:25.792 --> 57:27.876
<i> Are you streaming</i>
<i> lab cam now?</i>

57:27.878 --> 57:28.911
<i> You've broken the contract</i>

57:28.913 --> 57:29.978
<i> that you just signed.</i>

57:30.981 --> 57:32.748
You've broken the law.

57:32.750 --> 57:36.552
The university is gonna take you to court.

57:36.554 --> 57:41.156
You have completely jeopardized
the integrity of our work.

57:41.158 --> 57:43.826
I am not gonna let you
squander it away, Tom.

57:43.828 --> 57:46.161
I am not going to let you
ruin my life's work!

57:46.163 --> 57:49.231
George, listen to me.
I'm sorry, okay?

57:49.233 --> 57:51.533
But if you take this
to the university and tell them,

57:51.535 --> 57:52.601
we'll lose the whole thing.

57:52.603 --> 57:54.770
You will lose everything.

57:54.772 --> 57:56.772
<i> No one sees these videos,</i>
<i> trust me.</i>

57:56.774 --> 57:58.808
<i> No one watches them.</i>

57:58.809 --> 58:00.843
I was just so frustrated
that you were sitting on this.

58:02.913 --> 58:04.112
Keep them deleted.

59:04.708 --> 59:06.909
Yes?

59:06.911 --> 59:09.177
There is no formal statement from the university.

59:09.179 --> 59:11.013
Discredit the author, find out how this got out

59:11.015 --> 59:13.015
and make sure Tom and George don't talk.

59:13.017 --> 59:14.249
What can you tell me?

59:14.251 --> 59:16.051
Well, at 2:38 this morning,

59:16.053 --> 59:17.986
a recent graduate of our university

59:17.988 --> 59:20.689
made a post on her personal website titled,

59:20.691 --> 59:23.725
"Local Scientists Discover
Intelligent Alien Message."

59:23.727 --> 59:25.060
Usually, this wouldn't be a problem,

59:25.062 --> 59:26.828
<i> except she tweeted and e-mailed</i>

59:26.830 --> 59:28.897
<i> all major media outlets</i>
<i> across the world.</i>

59:28.899 --> 59:30.999
<i> Again, this</i>
<i> wouldn't be a problem</i>

59:31.001 --> 59:32.834
<i> except a reporter</i>
<i> at one of them,</i>

59:32.836 --> 59:34.069
Handelsblatt in Germany...

59:34.071 --> 59:35.671
Fucking Germans.

59:36.807 --> 59:38.924
<i> ...is a former member of SETI,</i>

59:38.925 --> 59:41.042
- Search for Extra..
- Terrestrial Intelligence. Shit.

59:42.112 --> 59:44.212
Shall I continue?

59:44.214 --> 59:45.948
They ran the story almost identically

59:45.950 --> 59:47.015
<i> to what was originally written.</i>

59:47.017 --> 59:49.151
<i> Then another in Finland.</i>

59:49.152 --> 59:51.286
<i> Within three hours,</i>
<i> it was across 28 major...</i>

59:51.288 --> 59:52.821
No, hold on.

59:54.692 --> 59:57.893
That's 103 major media outlets.

59:57.895 --> 59:59.661
And to be honest,
I'm surprised it took so long

59:59.663 --> 01:00:00.929
for you to be contacted.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.043
Be careful.

01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:20.349
Right. Shall we begin?

01:00:21.385 --> 01:00:22.818
As you're all aware,

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.953
our university has a long-standing history

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.822
of pushing the edges of discovery

01:00:26.824 --> 01:00:29.992
and the support we provide to creative researchers.

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:32.628
<i> One of these projects</i>
<i> has recently garnered</i>

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:33.695
<i> a lot of interest.</i>

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:36.215
<i> And as usual,</i>

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.734
speculation and rumor has
been spread by the media.

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:41.336
So, today, we're going to set the record straight.

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:43.705
I'd like to introduce our honorable Chancellor

01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:44.773
to tell you more.

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:47.709
Thank you, Shannon.

01:00:47.711 --> 01:00:51.380
These two scientists are researching dark radiation.

01:00:51.382 --> 01:00:53.749
A term which is new to the scientific community

01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:56.018
with very little known about it.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.854
And before I make you all aware of my ignorance,

01:00:58.856 --> 01:01:00.756
I'd like to hand it over to Dr. West

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:02.758
to tell you more about their research.

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:05.293
Thank you.

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.696
I've been working at the university

01:01:07.698 --> 01:01:10.365
with my partner here, Tom Edsman,

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:12.167
for the past eight months.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:16.672
The area in which we are
researching is dark radiation.

01:01:16.674 --> 01:01:18.373
No questions for now.

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:22.110
I have been researching
this area for over nine years

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:24.913
but it seems that
in the last little while

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:26.281
things have gotten out of hand.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.286
What Dr. West is saying

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:33.021
is that there has been wild speculation

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:34.540
spread by the media.

01:01:34.541 --> 01:01:36.058
<i> We are excited</i>
<i> by the possibilities</i>

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:39.961
but there is definitely
nothing to announce.

01:01:39.963 --> 01:01:42.798
We are still a long way away with our process.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.299
Years away.

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:46.001
Such is the scientific method.

01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:49.371
The woman who first wrote
the story on her personal blog

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:51.406
is not a credible source.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:55.243
And her quotes from Mr. Edsman are completely falsified.

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:57.012
Is that true, Tom?

01:01:57.014 --> 01:01:59.314
Scientific breakthroughs are not scandals

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:01.216
but we do believe that in due course,

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:02.801
we will be able to announce..

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:04.385
Can you tell us anything about the research

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:05.721
you've accomplished to date?

01:02:05.723 --> 01:02:07.723
As we said before, we are..

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.724
I wanna hear from the
scientists themselves, thanks.

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.004
On the third of June I received a signal from space

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:26.108
which was transmitted by a
highly intelligent life form.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.043
This signal contains information

01:02:28.045 --> 01:02:29.911
which we have recorded for some time.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.897
What Tom is trying to say is that..

01:02:31.898 --> 01:02:33.882
To date, we have recorded approximately 11 petabytes

01:02:33.884 --> 01:02:35.484
and we're on track to gather more information

01:02:35.486 --> 01:02:38.186
than the total collective knowledge
of all of humankind.

01:02:38.188 --> 01:02:41.022
<i> This information can be</i>
<i> transplanted into organisms.</i>

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:43.191
I know because I've done it to myself!

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:45.894
This is unsubstantiated and completely falsified!

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:47.295
Thank you all for coming today.

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:39.231
<i> In breaking news,</i>

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:41.149
<i> a research team</i>
<i> at RIST university...</i>

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:42.818
<i> ...claiming</i>
<i> that they have received</i>

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.419
<i> an intelligent signal</i>
<i> from space.</i>

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:46.888
<i> It is because</i>
<i> of scientists like this</i>

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.156
<i> that the public</i>
<i> don't have the faith</i>

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:50.091
<i>in rigorous scientific research.</i>

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:11.179
What happened with being
honest with each other?

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:17.986
It's 0.034 seconds slow.

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:23.358
George!

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:56.992
Here, take this.

01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:12.207
Whoa.

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:14.109
Let's just take a minute, shall we?

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:17.512
Just checking.

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:20.482
Have yourself a good day.

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:29.457
Rough day, rough day.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.194
George, it's important you do not take,

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:36.598
tamper with, or do anything with our property.

01:05:37.401 --> 01:05:39.434
Who's taking over?

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.202
No one knows what we've been doing here.

01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:43.004
I built this.

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:47.442
You know, I was glad when Tom blew it.

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:49.311
One might even think we put him up to it.

01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:54.382
You can't even talk to anyone about this.

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:55.450
Bullshit.

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.186
You don't own my ideas.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:00.155
My thoughts, my knowledge.

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:02.157
Your contract, George.

01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:05.060
Maybe you need me to remind
you what you signed.

01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:08.496
- This is ridiculous!
- George!

01:06:08.498 --> 01:06:11.700
We need to know that
you're not going to talk.

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:24.239
<i> Hi, you called Graham Dawson.</i>

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:25.740
<i> Please leave a message</i>
<i> after the tone,</i>

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:27.275
<i> and I'll get right back to you.</i>

01:07:33.784 --> 01:07:35.517
It's all gone, Graham.

01:07:39.623 --> 01:07:41.189
I've got nothing left.

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:46.161
They've taken everything.

01:07:51.168 --> 01:07:52.634
I've got nothing left to show.

01:07:57.207 --> 01:08:00.775
And I don't want it to
all have been for nothing.

01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:03.812
<i> I'm sorry.</i>
<i> Your message has taken too long.</i>

01:08:03.814 --> 01:08:05.580
<i> Please hang up and try again.</i>

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:30.104
Can I help you?

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.113
I'm done.

01:08:39.116 --> 01:08:41.716
- What?
- You deceived me.

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:43.518
Made me break the law without knowing.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.719
Hang on a second.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.154
You made me work with that kid.

01:08:46.156 --> 01:08:48.423
We are facing a lawsuit.

01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:50.859
And given that it was me who supported you,

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:52.260
I've been fired!

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:54.496
You're a disgrace, George!

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:03.537
Uh, it can wait.

01:09:04.241 --> 01:09:05.305
Get it.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.841
I always thought you'd make it.

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:44.546
You're good, George.
I forgot how good you are.

01:09:44.548 --> 01:09:47.182
<i> What are you saying?</i>
<i> Is this an apology?</i>

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:50.652
<i> Not an apology.</i>

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:54.656
You fucked up. Real bad.

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:56.858
Selling them our IP?

01:09:58.295 --> 01:10:00.929
<i> Fraud, jail probably.</i>

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:03.932
<i> I was always good to you.</i>

01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:06.534
But, hey.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:09.904
I got good news which you don't deserve.

01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:13.308
We're offering you a position

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:16.311
to come back and finish what you started.

01:10:16.313 --> 01:10:19.647
This is your project, your life's work.

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:22.617
We've been pushing your tech harder than you ever did

01:10:22.619 --> 01:10:24.219
but we're stuck.

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:25.787
<i> The side effects</i>
<i> of our test subjects</i>

01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:28.523
<i> are unpredictable.</i>

01:10:28.525 --> 01:10:30.258
<i> Side effects?</i>

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:31.992
<i> That's where</i>
<i> we need you, George.</i>

01:10:31.995 --> 01:10:33.761
<i> I'll give you the money,</i>

01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:36.397
the resources you need.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:38.333
<i> However you want it.</i>

01:10:38.335 --> 01:10:40.485
<i> But we keep it quiet.</i>

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:42.636
<i> Because if you go down,</i>
<i> I go down with you.</i>

01:10:45.442 --> 01:10:46.507
Deal.

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:29.043
You've taken 453 breaths since coming inside.

01:12:30.747 --> 01:12:32.747
You want some water?

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.748
Six to eight breaths per minute for optimum performance.

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:36.417
You should slow down.

01:12:38.722 --> 01:12:40.688
Pure H2O can kill you.

01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:51.632
Tom?

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:05.913
Tom!

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.599
<i> Early reports suggest</i>

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:01.102
<i> this was a coordinated</i>
<i> group suicide.</i>

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:03.971
<i> Those involved were not part</i>
<i> of a wider network.</i>

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:06.874
<i> The identity of those involved</i>
<i> is suppressed</i>

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:08.676
<i> but we can confirm this.</i>

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:11.212
<i> The number of victims</i>
<i> at this stage, five.</i>

01:14:11.214 --> 01:14:13.615
<i> According to a source,</i>

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:16.017
<i> the victims have been subject</i>
<i> to experimentations.</i>

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:18.152
<i> But at this stage,</i>
<i> that's speculation.</i>

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:20.955
<i> A friend of one of the victims</i>
<i> described the deceased</i>

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:25.059
<i> as private and hardworking</i>
<i> but increasingly antisocial.</i>

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:27.028
<i> There have been reports</i>
<i> of some victims</i>

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:29.664
<i> displaying uncharacteristic</i>
<i> tendencies.</i>

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:31.732
<i> Like erratic</i>
<i> and trance-like behavior,</i>

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:34.936
<i> social disengagements,</i>
<i> talking to themselves,</i>

01:14:34.938 --> 01:14:36.971
<i> and unprovoked assaults on...</i>

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:40.875
Tom, wake up, we're going.

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:45.780
Come on, come on.

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:49.010
Open the door.

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:51.646
Open the door!

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.285
Open the door now!

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:20.641
Come on.

01:16:38.595 --> 01:16:39.727
Tom?

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:42.196
Can you hear me?

01:17:45.294 --> 01:17:46.360
George.

01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:55.870
George.

01:17:55.872 --> 01:17:57.171
George, we gotta get out of here.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:32.206
Paul, I'm sure you're aware by now

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:33.808
that I've burnt your lab down.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.848
But I also know that those
suicides trace back to you.

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:45.186
I guess we're at a stalemate.

01:18:46.489 --> 01:18:47.922
Goodbye, Paul.

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:39.940
Hey.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.419
I'm so sorry.

01:19:55.024 --> 01:19:58.459
I was lost and confused, and...

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:01.128
I didn't know what I was doing.

01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:03.130
But I do now.

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:05.900
I'm here.

01:20:05.902 --> 01:20:07.301
And I'm ready for this.

01:20:08.871 --> 01:20:10.204
Are we good to go?

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:15.342
All right.
