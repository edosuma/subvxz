00:07.707 --> 00:09.868
Lieutenant Thomas Eugene Paris,

00:09.943 --> 00:13.276
l hereby reduce you
to the rank of Ensign.

00:13.346 --> 00:16.247
And l sentence you to 30
days solitary confinement.

00:16.315 --> 00:17.977
Take Ensign Paris to the brig.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.688
l know the way.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:47.347 --> 00:49.315
Brig.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.409
One... two... three...

03:41.354 --> 03:47.725
98... 99... 100.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.091
Staying in shape?

03:49.162 --> 03:50.527
Oh, yeah.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.189
l do it every time l'm in jail.

03:52.265 --> 03:53.698
Well, l hope

03:53.766 --> 03:55.358
all that exercise
gave you an appetite.

03:55.468 --> 03:56.958
Leola root stew again?

03:57.103 --> 03:59.298
That's the third time
this week.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.873
Can't you just
replicate me a pizza?

04:01.975 --> 04:03.169
Sorry, Tom.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.676
Basic nutrition only.

04:04.744 --> 04:05.870
Captain's orders.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.674
Ah, bread and water, huh?

04:08.748 --> 04:10.613
Let's have it.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.514
l got you the padd
you asked for.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.451
Oh... thanks.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.454
So...

04:17.523 --> 04:21.550
did you ask the warden
about those holodeck privileges?

04:21.628 --> 04:23.459
Uh, she said, and l quote:

04:23.529 --> 04:26.589
''Tell Mr. Paris this is
punishment, not shore leave.''

04:27.767 --> 04:29.029
lt was worth a try.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.067
Well...

04:30.136 --> 04:31.398
see you next meal.

04:31.504 --> 04:32.869
Wait, leaving already?

04:32.939 --> 04:34.201
Uh, pull up a chair.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.673
Stay awhile.

04:35.742 --> 04:39.678
Sorry. No nonessential
conversation with the prisoner.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.515
Do the words ''cruel and unusual''
mean anything to her?

04:44.584 --> 04:46.848
l'm telling you, Neelix,

04:46.919 --> 04:48.386
the inmates are getting
restless.

04:48.454 --> 04:51.184
She's going to have a full-blown
prison riot on her hands.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.615
Begin letter.

05:18.618 --> 05:21.246
Dear Father...

05:21.321 --> 05:23.118
pause... and erase.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.350
Begin.

05:28.428 --> 05:31.886
To Admiral Paris...

05:31.998 --> 05:34.159
pause... and erase.

05:39.439 --> 05:42.840
Begin.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.809
Hey, Dad...

05:44.877 --> 05:48.040
Long time, no see.

05:48.114 --> 05:51.447
Chances are you'll never
receive this letter...

05:51.517 --> 05:55.647
but in case you do, there's
a few things l wanted to say.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.551
First of all...

06:00.626 --> 06:02.594
bad news.

06:03.629 --> 06:07.565
Um... l'm in jail again.

06:08.634 --> 06:10.761
Wait! Keep listening.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.929
Don't turn this off.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.008
l want you to know
how l ended up in here...

06:16.075 --> 06:19.841
because...

06:19.912 --> 06:22.176
it's not what you think.

06:23.649 --> 06:26.618
lt all started on a morning
l was doing something

06:26.686 --> 06:29.246
you would find
a complete waste of time.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.829
Captain Proton
to Buster Kincaid.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.560
l've destroyed Dr. Chaotica's
mind control machine

06:41.634 --> 06:44.865
and l'm on my way back
to the spaceship.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.563
Hello, Proton.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.440
Who is this?

06:49.509 --> 06:51.704
An old friend.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.804
Make that two old friends.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.645
The Twin Mistresses of Evil...

06:57.717 --> 06:59.480
l should have known.

06:59.552 --> 07:04.251
l'm afraid your trusty sidekick
is indisposed at the moment.

07:04.323 --> 07:06.120
Don't worry about me, Captain.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.420
l can handle myself.

07:07.493 --> 07:09.290
We'll see about that.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.262
Bring me the brain probe.

07:11.330 --> 07:12.297
The what?

07:12.365 --> 07:15.232
The brain probe,
you insolent fool.

07:15.334 --> 07:17.268
Oh, right.

07:17.336 --> 07:19.531
Your wish is my command.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.129
Sorry, Harry.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.867
No problem.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.775
Torture me all you want,
Demonica.

07:25.845 --> 07:26.869
l'll never crack.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.743
Oh, but you will.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.680
By the time
we're through with you,

07:30.750 --> 07:33.548
you'll be begging to tell us
everything you know.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.883
You'll be our puppet.

07:35.988 --> 07:38.456
Our slave.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.014
Great.

07:40.092 --> 07:41.286
You're doing great.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.588
You're done for, Demonica.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.793
Malicia.
She's Demonica.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.198
Whatever.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.670
You two are going to jail
for a very long time.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.331
-Ooh.
-Ooh.

07:55.441 --> 07:57.204
Move it, toots.

07:57.276 --> 07:58.641
He's so brave.

07:58.711 --> 08:01.236
lt's a shame
we'll have to kill him.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.805
l've got everything
under control, Proton.

08:03.916 --> 08:06.749
Shouldn't you be
getting back to headquarters?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.719
And leave you at the mercy
of these two?

08:08.788 --> 08:11.018
Come on, Tom. l'm just
getting to the good part.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.422
Senior officers,
report to the Bridge.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.087
l guess the good part
will have to wait.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.130
Any progress
on those star charts?

08:18.197 --> 08:19.960
l'll have them to you by 1400.

08:20.032 --> 08:23.024
1400? You told me they'd
be done yesterday.

08:23.102 --> 08:24.034
l'm sorry, Tom.

08:24.103 --> 08:25.798
The sensor array went off-line.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.931
Seven of Nine will have it
up and running this morning.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.133
1400, l promise.

08:30.209 --> 08:31.233
You need some help?

08:31.310 --> 08:33.107
l'm not on duty again
till tomorrow morning.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.443
No, l don't want
to spoil your day off.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.607
Oh, l don't mind.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.309
Thanks, anyway.

08:39.385 --> 08:40.875
See you later, Lieutenant.

08:40.986 --> 08:42.181
Buster.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.850
Bye.

08:48.594 --> 08:49.561
l think Jenny really likes you.

08:49.629 --> 08:51.028
Yeah, l know.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.826
l thought
the feeling was mutual.

08:52.899 --> 08:54.867
How many times
do l have to tell you?

08:54.934 --> 08:57.528
l like Megan, but she won't
give me the time of day.

08:57.637 --> 08:58.831
What is the difference?

08:58.938 --> 08:59.962
You can't be serious.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.630
They're the Delaney sisters,
Harry.

09:01.741 --> 09:02.765
They're twins.

09:02.909 --> 09:03.807
Are you kidding?

09:03.910 --> 09:05.002
They're nothing alike.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.170
Jenny's aggressive,
and sometimes annoying,

09:07.246 --> 09:08.804
but Megan--
she's quiet, artistic

09:08.948 --> 09:11.815
and she's got that cute little
dimple in her right cheek.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.646
Jenny doesn't have the dimple?

09:13.719 --> 09:15.277
No dimple.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.049
Hmm.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.516
Bridge.

09:20.593 --> 09:23.118
Well, you've done it
again, Harry.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.423
What?

09:24.497 --> 09:27.227
Fallen
for the unattainable woman.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.098
First it was a hologram,
then a Borg,

09:30.202 --> 09:32.136
and now, the wrong twin.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.035
At least l'm consistent.

09:37.843 --> 09:39.504
Sorry to interrupt
your fun, gentlemen,

09:39.579 --> 09:40.637
but long-range sensors

09:40.713 --> 09:42.271
have picked up
something interesting.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.407
A concentrated mass
of oxygen and hydrogen.

09:44.483 --> 09:46.007
Lots of animal and plant life.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.010
An M-Class planet?

09:49.088 --> 09:50.783
No.
That's the interesting part.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.517
We're entering visual range.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.560
On screen.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.521
What is it?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.829
lt's an ocean.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.337
According to these readings,

10:10.409 --> 10:13.640
it's bigger than the Atlantic
and Pacific combined.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.271
What's holding it together?

10:15.348 --> 10:17.316
Looks like there's some
sort of a containment field

10:17.383 --> 10:18.441
keeping it from dissipating.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.314
Take us in closer, Tom.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.862
Are those starships
or submarines?

10:34.934 --> 10:36.333
Open a channel.

10:37.870 --> 10:40.338
This is Captain Janeway
of the Starship Voyager.

10:40.406 --> 10:41.839
Please identify yourselves.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.306
They are powering weapons.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.365
Shields.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.005
Red Alert.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.613
Shields holding.
No damage.

10:48.681 --> 10:49.807
Should l return fire?

10:49.882 --> 10:51.008
Not yet.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.710
Voyager to approaching vessels.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.309
We have no hostile intentions.

10:55.354 --> 10:56.582
They're maintaining
their course.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.090
Target the lead ship
and take out their weapons.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.165
Direct hit.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.598
They're hailing.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.669
l guess we got their attention.

11:10.770 --> 11:11.896
On screen.

11:12.038 --> 11:13.596
l'm Deputy Consul Burkus

11:13.706 --> 11:15.640
of the Monean
Maritime Sovereignty.

11:15.708 --> 11:18.700
You violated our space.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.075
Withdraw or we'll resume firing.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.809
Consul, we could have destroyed
your ships, but we didn't.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.316
We have no interest in a fight.

11:25.384 --> 11:27.045
Then why are you here?

11:27.119 --> 11:28.450
Because we're explorers

11:28.521 --> 11:30.546
and we're fascinated
by your ocean,

11:30.623 --> 11:32.784
and we'd like to learn
more about it

11:32.858 --> 11:34.951
and your people,
if you'd be willing.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.255
And if we are not?

11:37.329 --> 11:39.991
We'll be disappointed,
but we'll leave you alone.

11:42.168 --> 11:43.829
Your ship's impressive.

11:43.936 --> 11:46.404
Well, l'd be happy
to give you a tour.

11:48.307 --> 11:49.467
Forgive our vigilance, Captain.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.476
Over the years, my government
has had to protect our ocean

11:51.544 --> 11:53.637
from more than one
hostile species.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.839
l understand.

11:54.914 --> 11:57.348
We're also very protective
of our own natural resources.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.405
...about new cultures.

11:58.484 --> 11:59.815
Yours sounds
particularly fascinating.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.876
And this is Voyager's
command center.

12:01.987 --> 12:03.784
Feel free to have a look around.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.450
l'm curious, Consul.

12:05.524 --> 12:07.651
Have your people
always lived here?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.217
Our ancestors were nomadic.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.889
They only discovered
the waters 300 years ago.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.896
l'll bet they were
as stunned as we were

12:13.966 --> 12:16.332
to find this huge ball
of water floating in space.

12:16.435 --> 12:17.561
Yes.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.602
Mister...?

12:18.671 --> 12:20.138
Paris. Tom Paris.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.469
My First Officer,
Commander Chakotay.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.509
They realized they could
farm sea vegetation,

12:24.610 --> 12:25.872
extract oxygen from the ocean

12:25.945 --> 12:29.676
for their ships...
create a permanent home.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.114
What's your population?

12:31.183 --> 12:33.344
More than 80,000.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.217
And you all live underwater?

12:36.288 --> 12:39.724
Lieutenant, we do have
other business to attend to.

12:39.792 --> 12:42.090
Mr. Tuvok, escort our guests
to the briefing room.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.620
Care to join us, Mr. Paris?

12:45.698 --> 12:47.359
How could you tell?

12:52.004 --> 12:54.495
Do you still live
aboard your ships?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.700
We've built an industrial
infrastructure

12:56.809 --> 12:58.003
and undersea dwellings,

12:58.077 --> 13:00.568
but yes, most of our people
still choose to live

13:00.646 --> 13:01.772
as our ancestors did.

13:01.847 --> 13:04.042
Any idea how the ocean
came into existence?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.311
ln my experience,
it's a unique phenomenon.

13:06.385 --> 13:07.647
Riga?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.688
There are several theories.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.746
Our clerics teach
that the ocean

13:11.824 --> 13:14.088
was a divine gift
from the creators

13:14.160 --> 13:15.559
to protect and sustain us,

13:15.628 --> 13:18.756
but, in my opinion, the most
plausible explanation is

13:18.831 --> 13:21.823
that the ocean formed naturally,
much the same way

13:21.901 --> 13:23.232
that a gas giant does.

13:23.335 --> 13:24.461
Makes sense.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.231
Unfortunately,
our limited knowledge

13:26.338 --> 13:30.331
of the phenomenon has created
a few problems.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.034
What do you mean?

13:32.111 --> 13:34.944
l'm not sure
this is an appropriate topic.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.709
But they might be able
to help us.

13:36.782 --> 13:38.545
We'll do anything we can.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.585
The ocean's losing containment.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.850
Hydro-volume has decreased
more than seven percent

13:43.923 --> 13:44.912
in the last year alone.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.150
Any idea what's causing it?

13:46.225 --> 13:47.157
No.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.750
To make a thorough study,

13:48.828 --> 13:51.296
we'd need to explore
the ocean's center

13:51.363 --> 13:53.354
where l believe
the gravitational currents

13:53.432 --> 13:55.127
are fluctuating.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.168
But that's more
than 600 kilometers deep.

13:57.236 --> 14:01.297
Our best research vessel
can only go 100 kilometers.

14:01.407 --> 14:04.399
Beyond that,
the pressure's too great.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.102
Well, we could take you there.

14:07.146 --> 14:08.374
Captain?

14:14.053 --> 14:16.317
l had no idea you were
such an old salt.

14:16.388 --> 14:17.855
When l saw that ocean today,

14:17.923 --> 14:20.892
it reminded me of the first
time l read Jules Verne.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.552
20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.

14:22.628 --> 14:23.754
Mmm!

14:23.829 --> 14:26.457
l must have read it
20,000 times.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.898
l was obsessed
with stories about the ocean.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.901
All of my friends were busy
with their holo-programs.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.337
l had my head buried
in Captains Courageous,

14:34.406 --> 14:35.373
Moby Dick...

14:35.474 --> 14:36.907
So your interest
in history includes

14:36.976 --> 14:38.170
the 19th century, as well.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.839
Ancient sailing ships
were always my first love.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.472
l had it all planned.

14:43.549 --> 14:47.679
Finish high school, join
the Federation Naval Patrol...

14:47.753 --> 14:51.052
but my father had other ideas.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.613
You'd think Admiral Paris

14:52.691 --> 14:54.716
might have understood
his son's passion.

14:54.793 --> 14:57.125
Hmm...

14:57.196 --> 14:58.959
As far as he was concerned,

14:59.098 --> 15:00.861
the only ship
l was going to serve on

15:00.966 --> 15:02.831
had to have
a Starfleet insignia on it.

15:03.002 --> 15:05.436
So now you have an opportunity
to make up for lost time.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.129
Captain...

15:08.240 --> 15:10.140
with a few simple
thruster modifications

15:10.209 --> 15:12.769
to the Delta Flyer, she will
be seaworthy in no time.

15:12.845 --> 15:13.777
Good.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.245
lt'd take at least a week

15:15.314 --> 15:17.874
to make the necessary
modifications to Voyager.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.746
Then it's my mission?

15:19.818 --> 15:21.911
Bon voyage.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.523
And so, l thought to myself,

15:29.595 --> 15:32.393
who better than Harry
to be my first mate?

15:32.464 --> 15:33.396
First mate?

15:33.465 --> 15:34.397
Oh... sailor talk.

15:34.466 --> 15:35.797
You'll get the hang of it.

15:35.901 --> 15:36.799
Ah.

15:36.902 --> 15:38.028
l'm telling you, Harry,

15:38.137 --> 15:40.105
l have been dreaming
about something like this

15:40.205 --> 15:41.433
for as long as l can remember.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.632
Correct me if l'm wrong,

15:42.741 --> 15:44.709
but there is a mission
involved here, right?

15:44.810 --> 15:45.742
Of course!

15:45.811 --> 15:46.937
But there's no law that says

15:47.079 --> 15:49.138
we can't have a little
fun along the way.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.613
Ah, bosun.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.651
Ready to shove off?

15:52.718 --> 15:54.618
What are you talking
about, Lieutenant?

15:54.687 --> 15:55.915
Call me Skipper.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.785
Sailor talk.
You'll get used to it.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.084
l think not.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.887
Hull and thruster reinforcements
are complete.

16:01.026 --> 16:02.391
Ah, that's
what l wanted to hear.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.393
Oh, excuse me.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.054
Am l in the right place?

16:05.130 --> 16:07.428
Welcome aboard.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.160
l see you like to travel light.

16:09.268 --> 16:10.633
These are my instruments

16:10.736 --> 16:12.931
for measuring depth,
pressure, currents...

16:13.038 --> 16:14.096
We will not need them.

16:14.206 --> 16:16.231
This vessel is equipped
with a complete sensor array.

16:16.342 --> 16:18.310
-Oh.
-Uh, it's okay.

16:18.377 --> 16:21.039
You can store your gear
in the hold.

16:36.261 --> 16:38.525
20,000 kilometers
to the surface.

16:39.365 --> 16:40.889
lmmersion shielding?

16:41.033 --> 16:42.364
Active.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.027
Anchors aweigh.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.329
Those structures, what are they?

17:15.401 --> 17:19.359
lt's our main oxygen refinery
and desalination plant.

17:19.438 --> 17:23.602
Corrosion resistant alloys,
variable-density ballast...

17:23.675 --> 17:25.165
an efficient design.

17:25.277 --> 17:27.211
That means she's impressed.

17:27.279 --> 17:30.715
We're very proud
of what we've built here.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.080
l can see why.

17:39.191 --> 17:40.249
Come in.

17:44.196 --> 17:46.255
l'm afraid we have
some disturbing news.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.299
Oh?

17:48.367 --> 17:49.891
We've run a computer simulation

17:50.002 --> 17:52.095
to determine
the rate of dissipation.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.138
lt's worse
than Mr. Riga thought.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.537
According to our estimates,

17:55.607 --> 17:58.804
the ocean could experience
a complete loss of containment

17:58.877 --> 18:00.139
in less than five years.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.305
l'm sorry.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.315
Your calculations
could be wrong.

18:04.383 --> 18:05.907
l know it sounds grim,

18:05.984 --> 18:08.748
but there may be some
way to stop the process.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.550
And if there isn't?

18:12.891 --> 18:15.257
You might have to
consider evacuating.

18:15.327 --> 18:18.387
l'm supposed to go back
and explain this

18:18.464 --> 18:20.432
to 47 regional sovereigns?

18:20.499 --> 18:23.832
They'll pass their first
unanimous resolution...

18:23.936 --> 18:25.426
calling for my head.

18:25.537 --> 18:26.765
l can imagine

18:26.872 --> 18:28.840
how difficult this must be
for you...

18:28.941 --> 18:31.705
but you will have
to tell them.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.210
Perhaps...

18:33.278 --> 18:37.237
but l'll wait until
your Delta Flyer returns.

18:37.316 --> 18:40.683
Maybe they'll find
something tangible.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.091
We're at a depth
of 560 kilometers.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.228
What was that?

18:56.335 --> 18:57.825
The hull contracting.

18:57.936 --> 19:01.667
Rerouting additional power
to structural integrity.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.469
Nothing to worry about.

19:03.542 --> 19:10.072
l'm detecting multiphasic energy
discharges, bearing 021 mark 6.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.310
Range: 12 kilometers.

19:12.384 --> 19:13.715
A structure.

19:13.785 --> 19:15.047
At this depth?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.747
Adjusting course.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.052
l can't see anything.

19:21.126 --> 19:24.323
Give me forward illumination,
Harry.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.166
What is it?

19:29.268 --> 19:32.328
lt's generating massive amounts
of artificial gravity.

19:32.437 --> 19:35.167
Looks like
some kind of field reactor.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.172
lf it's malfunctioning,

19:36.241 --> 19:38.038
that would explain
the loss of hydro-volume.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.670
Maybe it can be repaired.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.543
lt looks ancient.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.588
Well, if these readings
are right,

19:50.656 --> 19:52.681
it's at least 100,000 years old.

19:54.459 --> 19:57.121
We've no records
of any previous inhabitants.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.663
Who built it?
Where did they go?

19:58.730 --> 19:59.992
Looks like the reactor

20:00.065 --> 20:01.589
is controlled
by a core computer.

20:01.667 --> 20:05.398
l'll try to upload the database
and get some answers.

20:05.504 --> 20:06.801
lnitiate the interface.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.430
Upload in progress.

20:12.678 --> 20:13.770
What's happening?

20:13.845 --> 20:15.779
We've got a visitor.

20:17.516 --> 20:19.313
What was it?!

20:19.384 --> 20:20.908
You're the one that lives here.
You tell us.

20:20.986 --> 20:23.477
No one's ever been
this far down before.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.080
We don't know anything
about marine life

20:26.158 --> 20:27.182
at these depths.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.250
You are about
to have the opportunity

20:29.328 --> 20:30.818
to make a detailed study.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.199
The creature's emitting
biothermic discharges.

20:42.307 --> 20:45.174
lt's like some kind
of electric eel.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.542
Only a hell of a lot bigger.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.406
And significantly more powerful.

20:52.484 --> 20:55.180
That last discharge
exceeded 500,000 volts.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.516
The shields are fried, Tom.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.887
You might want to think
about getting us out of here.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.360
Thrusters are off-line.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.423
Targeting forward phasers.

21:09.534 --> 21:10.523
No, you can't kill it.

21:10.636 --> 21:13.161
l do not intend to.

21:15.874 --> 21:18.342
Unfortunately, the creature
does not seem to be

21:18.410 --> 21:19.536
of a similar opinion.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.771
How's that upload coming?

21:20.846 --> 21:22.040
Another couple of minutes.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.638
Firing phasers.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.884
l think we only made him madder.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.513
The creature is retreating.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.155
We've got a breach!

21:38.230 --> 21:40.164
l'm on it.

21:45.203 --> 21:48.297
600 kilometers underwater,
propulsion off-line,

21:48.407 --> 21:49.772
water pouring into the cabin...

21:51.009 --> 21:51.941
lt was like something

21:52.010 --> 21:53.534
out of one
of those Jules Verne stories

21:53.612 --> 21:55.011
you used to read me
when l was a kid.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.012
Red Alert!

21:57.115 --> 21:59.276
All hands to battle stations.

21:59.351 --> 22:00.283
Hey, what about me?

22:00.385 --> 22:01.409
lf we're in trouble,

22:01.453 --> 22:03.353
we need our best pilot
at the helm.

22:03.422 --> 22:05.049
You can't just leave me here!

22:19.838 --> 22:20.896
Five ships?

22:21.039 --> 22:23.530
And they just opened
fire without warning?

22:23.642 --> 22:24.768
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh...

22:24.843 --> 22:25.935
How did we get away?

22:26.044 --> 22:28.604
Apparently, Ensign Culhane
confused the enemy

22:28.680 --> 22:31.240
with a brilliant series
of evasive maneuvers.

22:31.316 --> 22:33.648
l hear Captain Janeway
is considering him

22:33.719 --> 22:35.050
for Chief Conn Officer.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.052
Oh, yeah?

22:36.121 --> 22:37.952
Well, you just tell the Captain

22:38.056 --> 22:40.115
that Culhane's
brilliant maneuvers

22:40.192 --> 22:41.955
almost knocked me unconscious.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.392
You'd think he'd never
flown a shuttle,

22:44.463 --> 22:45.760
much less a starship.

22:45.831 --> 22:47.128
There we are.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.461
That's it?

22:48.533 --> 22:50.967
Aren't you going to run
a neurological scan?

22:51.136 --> 22:53.627
Maybe l should be granted
a medical reprieve.

22:53.739 --> 22:57.140
Your injury was what Naomi
Wildman refers to as a boo-boo.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.302
Come on, Doc. You don't
understand what it's like

22:59.378 --> 23:01.073
being down here
all day, every day.

23:01.179 --> 23:02.111
l'm going crazy.

23:02.147 --> 23:03.205
Correct me if l'm wrong,

23:03.281 --> 23:04.339
but isn't that the idea?

23:04.416 --> 23:05.348
No, seriously, Doc,

23:05.417 --> 23:06.714
you might want to take me down

23:06.785 --> 23:08.844
to Sick Bay for a full
psychiatric evaluation.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.252
Three or four days
of observation at least.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.018
See you in 20 days.

23:13.091 --> 23:14.752
Doc!

23:24.202 --> 23:26.636
Resume recording.

23:28.707 --> 23:31.335
Okay, Dad, where were we?

23:31.410 --> 23:32.672
Ah, right.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.235
We had just sprung a leak.

23:44.823 --> 23:47.690
Nothing like a cold shower
to wake up the senses.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.727
Structural integrity
is weakening.

23:49.795 --> 23:52.559
We've lost communications,
shields, propulsion.

23:52.631 --> 23:54.963
We can reduce our density
by venting plasma

23:55.033 --> 23:57.365
and transporting
all nonessential equipment

23:57.469 --> 23:58.959
off the ship.

23:59.137 --> 24:02.231
lt will take time, but we will
eventually rise to the surface.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.604
l think we should stay.

24:04.643 --> 24:06.042
Stay?

24:06.111 --> 24:09.342
l'm not about to be scared off
by a few damaged systems.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.746
Tom, don't you think
maybe you're carrying

24:11.817 --> 24:14.308
this Captains Courageous thing
a little too far?

24:14.386 --> 24:15.648
Look...

24:15.720 --> 24:17.847
it's a good bet that the
reactor's malfunctioning.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.982
Now, we're only going to get
one shot at fixing it.

24:20.058 --> 24:21.150
You want to leave, fine.

24:21.226 --> 24:22.625
Give me an environmental suit

24:22.694 --> 24:24.992
and you can pick me up
after you've repaired the Flyer.

24:25.063 --> 24:27.122
You're going for a swim?
Are you crazy?

24:27.199 --> 24:29.133
You have a better idea?

24:30.535 --> 24:32.435
Well...

24:32.504 --> 24:35.701
we already managed to interface
with the reactor's computer.

24:35.774 --> 24:38.174
Maybe we can make the repairs,
maybe we can't,

24:38.243 --> 24:40.404
but l'm not leaving you
down here alone.

24:41.913 --> 24:43.710
What about you two?

24:43.782 --> 24:45.647
l'll stay.

24:46.651 --> 24:47.845
Seven?

24:47.919 --> 24:50.888
lt is in my nature
to comply with the collective.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.155
l'm detecting a breach
in the containment field.

25:02.267 --> 25:03.461
Any way we can seal it?

25:03.535 --> 25:05.298
We might try reinforcing
the field

25:05.403 --> 25:06.631
with a deflector beam.

25:06.738 --> 25:07.796
Do it.

25:07.906 --> 25:09.533
Try hailing the
Delta Flyer again.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.472
Nothing.

25:13.545 --> 25:15.172
What do you think's happened?

25:15.247 --> 25:18.011
They may be too deep
to receive a transmission.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.812
They may have had an accident.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.216
-lt's possible.
-Possible?

25:21.286 --> 25:24.153
Captain, l'll need a better
explanation than that.

25:24.222 --> 25:26.486
What am l supposed
to tell the Council?

25:26.558 --> 25:27.991
Clarify something for me.

25:28.059 --> 25:29.321
Are you more concerned

25:29.394 --> 25:31.885
about the lives
of the people on that shuttle

25:32.030 --> 25:33.520
or your political career?

25:35.834 --> 25:37.426
What's that?

25:37.536 --> 25:38.935
A gravimetric discharge.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.028
The reactor's core is unstable.

25:41.139 --> 25:43.266
You'd be unstable, too, if you
were as old as this thing.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.808
Age has nothing to do with it.

25:44.876 --> 25:47.174
The reactor's diverting
massive amounts of power

25:47.245 --> 25:48.837
to its structural
integrity field,

25:48.914 --> 25:51.246
power normally reserved
for oceanic containment.

25:51.316 --> 25:53.375
That would explain why
containment is weakening.

25:53.451 --> 25:56.614
Looks like the density
of the water's been increasing

25:56.688 --> 25:57.620
over the past few years.

25:57.689 --> 25:58.883
lt seems the reactor's
just trying

25:58.957 --> 26:00.151
to keep itself
from being crushed.

26:02.294 --> 26:05.730
Can we initiate a power
transfer, stabilize the core?

26:05.797 --> 26:08.664
l believe so, but it would be
a temporary solution.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.600
lt's better than nothing.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.774
Captain, full containment
has just been re-established.

26:21.846 --> 26:22.972
The deflector beam.

26:23.048 --> 26:24.515
Negative. The ocean appears

26:24.583 --> 26:26.551
to have been stabilized
from within.

26:26.618 --> 26:29.109
lt looks like our team
has succeeded.

26:29.187 --> 26:32.588
l'm picking up an object
on a slow ascent.

26:32.657 --> 26:34.454
lt's the Flyer.

26:37.495 --> 26:39.087
You found something?

26:39.164 --> 26:41.894
l've been studying
the generator's database.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.900
You're not going
to believe this,

26:44.069 --> 26:47.630
but apparently, your ocean
used to be part of a landmass.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.206
Really?

26:49.307 --> 26:50.433
As far as l can tell,

26:50.542 --> 26:52.703
it was part
of a planetary ecosystem

26:52.777 --> 26:55.268
inhabited by
a very advanced civilization.

26:55.347 --> 26:56.609
What happened to them?

26:56.681 --> 26:58.046
That's a good question.

26:58.116 --> 27:01.574
All l know is they launched
this reactor into orbit.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.086
They used some kind

27:03.154 --> 27:05.145
of elaborate
kinetic transfer system

27:05.223 --> 27:09.057
to draw the water and everything
in it up to the reactor.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.320
Extraordinary.

27:13.398 --> 27:16.765
Why would anyone want
to move an entire ocean?

27:16.868 --> 27:20.133
Maybe there was some kind
of disaster on the planet,

27:20.238 --> 27:22.502
or maybe it was
just an experiment.

27:22.574 --> 27:25.270
That must have been
a massive undertaking.

27:25.343 --> 27:27.140
Took them almost 200 years.

27:27.212 --> 27:30.443
l wonder what they'd think
if they knew we settled here

27:30.515 --> 27:32.346
and built another civilization.

27:32.417 --> 27:35.875
Actually, l think
they'd be pretty concerned.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.444
Oh?

27:37.522 --> 27:40.889
This field reactor
that they designed--

27:40.959 --> 27:44.895
it's a pretty amazing piece
of technology-- durable...

27:45.030 --> 27:48.898
l don't think it's responsible
for the loss of containment.

27:49.067 --> 27:52.036
But as soon as we made
the recalibration,

27:52.137 --> 27:53.695
the water stabilized.

27:53.805 --> 27:56.296
l don't see
what else it could be.

27:56.408 --> 28:00.504
Riga, your mining operations
are destroying the ocean.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.120
You'll never get
into Starfleet Academy

28:10.188 --> 28:11.519
by playing with toys.

28:11.589 --> 28:12.647
Do your homework.

28:12.724 --> 28:14.783
Are you listening to me, Thomas?

28:14.859 --> 28:16.622
Thomas Eugene Paris,

28:16.695 --> 28:18.595
l hereby reduce you
to the rank of Ensign.

28:18.663 --> 28:21.131
And l sentence you to 30 years
in solitary confinement.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.791
Go to your room, young man.

28:22.867 --> 28:23.959
That's an order.

28:24.069 --> 28:26.299
Stay there and think
about what l've said.

28:26.404 --> 28:29.737
Tom... Tom...

28:29.808 --> 28:31.002
Tom, wake up.

28:32.577 --> 28:33.839
Bad dream?

28:33.912 --> 28:36.039
Oh...

28:36.114 --> 28:37.604
You could say that.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.121
You know, you look like hell.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.851
Thanks.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.893
How'd you get past the guard?

28:49.027 --> 28:50.892
The Vulcan neck pinch.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.553
Come to spring me?

28:52.630 --> 28:55.656
Well, the Captain finally
gave me permission to visit,

28:55.734 --> 28:57.565
but l've only got a few minutes.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.261
That's big of her.

28:59.370 --> 29:00.803
How are you doing?

29:00.905 --> 29:04.341
Oh, 30 days?
No problem.

29:04.442 --> 29:07.639
How's B'Elanna?

29:07.712 --> 29:09.509
She misses you.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.414
Yeah. l know the feeling.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.817
So, what have you been doing
to pass the time?

29:15.887 --> 29:20.347
Thinking and...

29:20.425 --> 29:22.791
thinking.

29:22.861 --> 29:25.455
Trying not to think.

29:25.530 --> 29:29.557
Actually, l started recording
a letter to my father.

29:29.667 --> 29:31.225
Really?

29:31.336 --> 29:33.463
Yeah.

29:33.571 --> 29:35.971
For some reason, l...

29:36.040 --> 29:39.567
l wanted to explain to him
how l ended up in here.

29:39.644 --> 29:41.669
l didn't want him to think...

29:41.746 --> 29:46.274
Well, anyway, l realized
how ridiculous it was.

29:46.351 --> 29:47.682
You should finish it.

29:47.752 --> 29:49.219
Give me one good reason.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.118
Maybe he'll hear it someday.

29:51.189 --> 29:52.383
Doubtful.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.891
You'll feel better
getting it off your chest.

29:54.993 --> 29:58.019
Are you bucking for
ship's counselor, Harry?

29:58.096 --> 30:00.997
What are you going to do,
delete the letter?

30:01.065 --> 30:02.657
That would be pointless.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.429
At least l'm consistent.

30:04.536 --> 30:05.468
Tom...

30:05.537 --> 30:07.505
Thanks for the visit, Harry.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.570
See you in 14.

30:21.119 --> 30:23.644
What was it you once told me?

30:23.721 --> 30:26.713
That your father used to say
you never finished anything?

30:43.007 --> 30:44.736
Resume recording.

30:44.809 --> 30:49.007
So, we told Consul Burkus
about the alien field reactor

30:49.113 --> 30:52.674
and how his oxygen refineries
were destroying it.

30:52.750 --> 30:56.186
He took the news pretty well...
at first.

30:56.254 --> 30:59.121
The Council's very grateful
for your help, Captain.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.589
They've asked me to request

31:00.692 --> 31:02.592
the shield
and thruster schematics

31:02.627 --> 31:03.992
for your Delta Flyer.

31:04.062 --> 31:07.190
We're hoping to design a probe
that'll allow us to monitor

31:07.265 --> 31:08.664
the containment generator.

31:08.733 --> 31:09.700
Lieutenant Torres

31:09.801 --> 31:11.530
will give you
everything you need.

31:11.636 --> 31:13.331
l've also drawn up some designs

31:13.438 --> 31:15.235
for an oxygen
replication system.

31:15.306 --> 31:17.069
lt'll allow you
to create free oxygen

31:17.141 --> 31:18.938
without extricating
it from the water.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.944
lt won't solve your problems
overnight,

31:22.046 --> 31:23.343
but it's a start.

31:23.414 --> 31:25.211
l'm sure it'll be very helpful.

31:25.283 --> 31:28.684
Our oxygen extraction levels
are still dangerously high.

31:28.753 --> 31:31.881
l'm going to recommend
shutting down refineries

31:31.956 --> 31:33.287
four, five and six.

31:33.358 --> 31:36.191
We'll take it
under advisement. Well...

31:36.261 --> 31:38.422
Captain, l wish you
a safe journey.

31:38.496 --> 31:40.726
Well, we have
a few more suggestions,

31:40.798 --> 31:41.958
if you'd like to hear them.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.432
Please... pass them along
to Mr. Riga.

31:44.535 --> 31:46.366
He'll include them
in his report.

31:46.471 --> 31:47.460
l'm curious.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.836
Who's going to read that report?

31:49.908 --> 31:51.899
lt will be given
to the subcommittees

31:52.010 --> 31:53.739
on life support and agriculture.

31:53.811 --> 31:55.142
Excuse me, Consul,

31:55.213 --> 31:58.376
l'm not sure you understand
the magnitude of the crisis.

31:58.449 --> 32:00.679
What you're suggesting
could take months.

32:00.785 --> 32:02.810
Thank you, Mr. Riga.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.481
You should listen to him.

32:04.555 --> 32:08.184
lf you don't make some serious
changes around here soon,

32:08.259 --> 32:10.887
that ocean won't be here
much longer.

32:10.962 --> 32:13.430
As l said,
we understand his concerns.

32:13.498 --> 32:14.658
Do you? lt seems to me

32:14.732 --> 32:17.223
like you're just trying
to sidestep the issue

32:17.302 --> 32:18.530
and send us on our way.

32:18.636 --> 32:19.898
With all due respect,

32:20.038 --> 32:22.199
who are you
to tell us what to do

32:22.307 --> 32:23.569
with our ocean?

32:23.641 --> 32:25.939
With all due respect,
it's not your ocean.

32:26.077 --> 32:27.840
Lieutenant.

32:27.912 --> 32:29.436
lt's all right, Captain.

32:29.514 --> 32:31.948
l'd like to respond,
but not as a diplomat

32:32.083 --> 32:33.175
as a Monean.

32:33.251 --> 32:35.583
You came here claiming
you wanted to learn

32:35.653 --> 32:36.813
about our way of life,

32:36.888 --> 32:38.913
and now, having spent
three days here,

32:38.990 --> 32:40.753
you're suggesting we abandon it.

32:40.825 --> 32:44.158
We have an expression--
brine in the veins.

32:44.228 --> 32:45.855
Tell him what it means.

32:45.930 --> 32:48.057
lt's used to describe someone

32:48.132 --> 32:51.158
who has a special connection
to the waters.

32:51.269 --> 32:56.138
My family has lived here
for ten generations.

32:56.207 --> 33:00.473
We protected this ocean,
cultivated it,

33:00.545 --> 33:03.309
lived in harmony with
the animals that inhabit it.

33:03.381 --> 33:05.508
Can you say the same?

33:07.385 --> 33:08.784
l didn't think so.

33:08.853 --> 33:11.185
Good day, Captain.

33:17.762 --> 33:19.354
We can't just let this go.

33:19.430 --> 33:21.261
What do you want me to do?

33:21.332 --> 33:24.631
Of course.
The almighty Prime Directive.

33:24.736 --> 33:27.762
Would you please excuse us,
Lieutenant.

33:30.742 --> 33:31.902
See you later.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.879
l know you're upset, Lieutenant,

33:36.948 --> 33:38.438
but when you're
in a room with me,

33:38.516 --> 33:40.746
you check that attitude
at the door. Understood?

33:40.818 --> 33:41.876
Captain...

33:41.953 --> 33:43.750
We can't expect
an entire society

33:43.821 --> 33:46.585
to change because we
think they should.

33:46.657 --> 33:48.682
-Then you agree with me.
-Yes.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.751
And we gave them
the help they asked for.

33:50.828 --> 33:52.090
We told them what we know.

33:52.163 --> 33:54.961
Now it's up to them to do
what they think is appropriate.

33:55.099 --> 33:55.963
You heard that consul.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.226
They're not going to do
a damn thing.

33:57.335 --> 33:58.529
Maybe not, but that's
their prerogative.

33:58.636 --> 34:00.866
-Captain...
-End of discussion, Lieutenant.

34:00.972 --> 34:03.099
At 1400 hours,
we'll resume a course

34:03.174 --> 34:05.506
for the Alpha Quadrant.
ls that clear?

34:05.576 --> 34:08.636
ls that clear?

34:08.713 --> 34:10.647
As a bell.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.135
Hey.

34:35.206 --> 34:37.731
Here to stamp out
intergalactic evil?

34:41.779 --> 34:43.246
lt's funny.

34:45.183 --> 34:46.480
What?

34:46.551 --> 34:48.518
l went on this mission

34:48.585 --> 34:52.317
expecting to play out
a childhood fantasy,

34:52.389 --> 34:55.553
but along the way,

34:55.626 --> 35:02.930
when l realized that ocean
would just be... gone one day...

35:03.034 --> 35:05.366
it started to matter to me.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.869
Sounds pretty stupid, huh?

35:10.942 --> 35:12.239
No.

35:15.146 --> 35:18.411
No, it sounds like you've
found yourself a cause.

35:20.751 --> 35:23.879
l never thought of myself
as a cause kind of guy.

35:24.021 --> 35:27.513
Well, for what it's worth,
l'm proud of you.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.889
Thanks.

35:32.930 --> 35:36.422
But Captain Proton's
not going to be able

35:36.534 --> 35:39.332
to save the day this time,
is he?

35:39.437 --> 35:42.031
What about Tom Paris?

35:49.080 --> 35:52.174
Council Chamber, please.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.309
Riga...

35:54.385 --> 35:56.615
You're dismissed, crewman.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.752
l want you to tell me honestly--

36:03.828 --> 36:05.295
what do you think's
going to happen now?

36:05.363 --> 36:06.557
l think the bureaucracy

36:06.631 --> 36:08.963
isn't going to make
more than token changes.

36:09.033 --> 36:10.625
lsn't there anything else
you can do?

36:10.735 --> 36:11.827
l don't see how.

36:11.936 --> 36:15.565
Other than taking the oxygen
refineries off-line.

36:17.041 --> 36:20.306
What would happen--

36:20.378 --> 36:22.471
hypothetically--

36:22.547 --> 36:26.847
if someone were to shut down
the refineries?

36:26.918 --> 36:30.376
Well, l suppose
they'd have to be rebuilt.

36:30.454 --> 36:32.649
Yeah, and they'd probably
be more willing

36:32.723 --> 36:34.691
to redesign them
while they're at it.

36:34.759 --> 36:37.353
lf nothing else,
it would grab their attention.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.019
Are you suggesting...?

36:40.097 --> 36:42.088
l'm just asking questions...

36:42.166 --> 36:45.192
because l'm not supposed
to get involved

36:45.303 --> 36:48.329
in the internal affairs
of alien worlds...

36:48.439 --> 36:52.773
unless, of course,
someone makes a direct request.

36:57.615 --> 37:01.813
lf you can get me down there,
l'd be willing to do it.

37:01.886 --> 37:05.219
You'd be risking your life.

37:06.424 --> 37:07.823
l know.

37:11.295 --> 37:12.819
Captain, there has just been

37:12.930 --> 37:15.558
an unauthorized launch
from Shuttle Bay 1--

37:15.633 --> 37:16.827
the Delta Flyer.

37:16.934 --> 37:19.232
Tom.

37:30.348 --> 37:31.315
Hail him.

37:32.350 --> 37:33.339
No response.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.475
Try a tractor beam.

37:34.552 --> 37:35.746
We're out of range.

37:35.820 --> 37:38.084
We're being hailed, Captain.
lt's Consul Burkus.

37:38.155 --> 37:41.056
Your shuttlecraft
has violated our borders.

37:41.125 --> 37:42.786
l demand an explanation.

37:42.860 --> 37:45.351
Mr. Paris is acting
without authorization.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.361
To what end?

37:46.430 --> 37:49.888
According to our scans,
Mr. Riga is with him.

37:50.067 --> 37:53.059
l have to assume they intend
to take some sort of...

37:53.170 --> 37:55.604
radical action
to protect the ocean.

37:55.673 --> 37:56.935
Then l presume

37:57.041 --> 37:59.976
you intend to take
radical action to stop them.

38:17.628 --> 38:21.155
Warning. Hull pressure
approaching critical.

38:21.232 --> 38:22.824
We're going down too fast.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.730
lt's the only way we
can outrun your ships.

38:25.836 --> 38:29.363
Janeway to Paris.
Return to Voyager immediately.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.407
l'm sorry, Captain.

38:31.475 --> 38:33.102
l can't do that.

38:33.177 --> 38:37.113
Lieutenant, you are disobeying
a direct order.

38:37.181 --> 38:38.978
l know.

38:40.885 --> 38:41.852
He cut us off.

38:41.919 --> 38:43.216
What the hell are they up to?

38:43.287 --> 38:44.413
Looks like they're heading

38:44.488 --> 38:46.285
directly beneath
the industrial complex.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.881
Can we reach them with phasers?

38:47.958 --> 38:49.084
Unadvisable.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.219
lt would create
a hydro-dynamic shock wave.

38:51.295 --> 38:53.263
What about an old-fashioned
depth charge?

38:53.331 --> 38:55.799
lt should be possible
to modify a photon torpedo.

38:55.866 --> 38:57.390
We could program it to detonate

38:57.501 --> 38:59.560
once it's in proximity
to the Delta Flyer.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.069
Do it.

39:07.144 --> 39:08.702
The torpedo is ready, Captain.

39:08.779 --> 39:11.612
However,
the Delta Flyer has submerged

39:11.682 --> 39:13.274
below our targeting range.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.148
Consul Burkus, hailing again.

39:15.219 --> 39:16.208
On screen.

39:16.287 --> 39:17.618
Our refinery workers

39:17.688 --> 39:20.816
have been given five minutes
to clear the structure.

39:20.958 --> 39:24.394
Was this the kind of evacuation
you had in mind, Captain?

39:24.462 --> 39:25.827
Can you get them out in time?

39:25.896 --> 39:27.090
Yes, but...

39:27.164 --> 39:28.256
Do it.

39:28.332 --> 39:29.594
l'll find a way
to protect your refinery.

39:29.667 --> 39:30.599
End transmission.

39:30.701 --> 39:31.360
Captain!

39:32.169 --> 39:33.500
He descended to avoid attack.

39:33.571 --> 39:34.970
lf my calculations are correct,

39:35.039 --> 39:37.667
he will have to come back up
to a depth of 2,000 meters

39:37.775 --> 39:38.742
to strike his target.

39:38.843 --> 39:40.470
Giving us a window
of opportunity.

39:40.544 --> 39:41.602
Precisely.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.874
Captain, this is Tom
we're talking about.

39:44.014 --> 39:46.039
We're not going
to open fire, are we?

39:46.117 --> 39:48.642
As far as l'm concerned,
he forfeited his status

39:48.719 --> 39:50.482
as a protected member
of this crew

39:50.554 --> 39:52.488
the second he launched
that shuttle.

39:57.561 --> 40:00.052
How long till we reach
our target?

40:00.131 --> 40:02.395
36 seconds.

40:03.501 --> 40:05.492
He's started his ascent.

40:05.603 --> 40:06.661
Hail him.

40:06.771 --> 40:07.897
Go ahead.

40:08.005 --> 40:11.907
Lieutenant Paris,
this is your final warning.

40:11.976 --> 40:14.103
He's not responding.

40:14.178 --> 40:16.544
Arm the torpedo.

40:16.614 --> 40:19.515
20 seconds to weapons range.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.881
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

40:23.421 --> 40:24.445
You?

40:24.522 --> 40:27.958
l've taken you this far.

40:28.025 --> 40:30.550
We better arm that missile.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.798
Missile armed.

40:36.867 --> 40:41.270
Stand down, Mr. Paris,
or l will open fire.

40:44.141 --> 40:47.440
Still no answer.

40:47.511 --> 40:49.342
Time.

40:49.413 --> 40:51.677
Ten seconds.

40:51.749 --> 40:53.273
Nine...

40:53.350 --> 40:55.443
Eight... seven...

40:55.519 --> 40:57.009
six...

40:57.154 --> 40:58.280
Five...

40:58.355 --> 41:00.619
four... three...

41:00.724 --> 41:02.919
Two... one.

41:02.960 --> 41:03.892
Fire.

41:03.994 --> 41:04.688
Fire!

41:17.741 --> 41:19.675
The Flyer has been disabled.

41:19.743 --> 41:21.176
Their missile?

41:21.245 --> 41:22.712
Deflected.

41:29.253 --> 41:33.952
Captain's Log, Stardate 52179.4.

41:34.024 --> 41:36.117
After salvaging the Delta Flyer,

41:36.193 --> 41:38.923
we've resumed our course
toward the Alpha Quadrant.

41:38.996 --> 41:42.090
l now have to turn my attention
to a matter of discipline.

41:43.901 --> 41:46.631
Lieutenant Thomas Eugene Paris,

41:46.737 --> 41:48.705
you are guilty
of insubordination,

41:48.806 --> 41:50.967
unauthorized use
of a spacecraft,

41:51.075 --> 41:52.235
reckless endangerment

41:52.309 --> 41:54.243
and conduct
unbecoming an officer.

41:54.311 --> 41:56.506
Do you have anything to say?

41:56.580 --> 41:57.774
Riga needed my help.

41:57.848 --> 42:00.009
ln doing so, you disobeyed
my direct orders.

42:00.050 --> 42:01.244
Yes, ma'am.

42:01.285 --> 42:03.412
You violated the protocols
that govern this crew.

42:03.487 --> 42:04.749
Yes, ma'am.

42:04.822 --> 42:06.881
You nearly caused an armed
conflict with the Moneans.

42:06.991 --> 42:09.221
And frankly, you're lucky to
be standing here right now.

42:09.293 --> 42:11.261
l would have destroyed
your shuttle if necessary.

42:11.328 --> 42:15.128
Yes, ma'am.

42:15.199 --> 42:17.190
Permission to speak freely.

42:21.071 --> 42:23.539
Riga's people
weren't going to listen.

42:23.607 --> 42:24.904
They were going
to ignore our warnings.

42:24.975 --> 42:26.465
You don't know that.

42:26.577 --> 42:29.512
Riga knew, and l was the only
one who could help them.

42:29.580 --> 42:30.706
l understand your passion,

42:30.781 --> 42:32.715
but passion alone
doesn't give you the right

42:32.783 --> 42:34.375
to take matters
into your own hands.

42:34.451 --> 42:36.578
Four years ago,
l released you from prison

42:36.654 --> 42:38.087
and gave you a fresh start.

42:38.155 --> 42:39.952
Until now, you've been
a fine officer.

42:40.057 --> 42:42.218
Your service on this ship
has been exemplary.

42:42.293 --> 42:44.921
l really believed you were
past this kind of conduct.

42:44.995 --> 42:48.590
l've never been very good
at playing by the rules.

42:48.666 --> 42:52.193
That doesn't mean
that serving under your command

42:52.303 --> 42:54.771
hasn't changed me--
for the better.

42:54.872 --> 42:58.273
At least this time,
l broke the rules for a reason,

42:58.342 --> 43:00.742
for something l believed in.

43:00.844 --> 43:02.812
l admire your principles, Tom,

43:02.846 --> 43:05.314
but l can't ignore
what you've done.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.580
l hereby reduce you
to the rank of Ensign.

43:09.653 --> 43:13.248
And l sentence you
to 30 days solitary confinement.

43:13.324 --> 43:14.985
Take Ensign Paris to the brig.

43:17.361 --> 43:19.829
l know the way.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.758
Rise and shine, Ensign.

43:24.868 --> 43:26.859
Your 30 days have been served.

43:32.576 --> 43:34.840
You may want to shave first.

43:34.912 --> 43:36.209
Yes, sir.

43:48.859 --> 43:50.690
Torres to Paris.

43:50.761 --> 43:52.126
Go ahead.

43:52.196 --> 43:55.131
Rumor has it
that you're free for dinner.

43:55.199 --> 43:56.666
Gee, l don't know.

43:56.734 --> 44:00.397
Are you sure you want to be seen
associating with an ex-con?

44:00.504 --> 44:01.971
My quarters, 0700.

44:02.072 --> 44:04.063
That's an order, Ensign.

44:04.174 --> 44:06.301
Yes, ma'am.

44:13.684 --> 44:15.652
Resume recording.

44:19.690 --> 44:23.490
Well, l'm out now
and back to my duties.

44:28.699 --> 44:33.159
l honestly don't know
if l'll ever understand you

44:33.237 --> 44:37.173
or what went wrong between us,

44:37.241 --> 44:42.543
but l hope this letter helps you
understand me a little better.

44:50.754 --> 44:55.657
Computer, file letter
in my personal database...

44:57.561 --> 45:01.258
and transmit when we're
within range of Earth.
