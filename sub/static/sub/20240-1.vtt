00:19.705 --> 00:22.374
Cubs parking!
Easy entry and exit!

00:22.457 --> 00:23.834
How is it going?

00:23.917 --> 00:24.918
Forty.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.046
"Here, sir."
- Easy money.

00:28.130 --> 00:31.174
Money comes in every day.

00:33.468 --> 00:34.928
Cubs parking!

00:36.096 --> 00:37.096
Hey, Ronnie!

00:41.685 --> 00:42.936
When I come back?

00:43.020 --> 00:44.772
I will call you. I'll let you know.

00:44.855 --> 00:45.856
- Good.
- Thank you.

00:45.939 --> 00:47.524
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:14.009 --> 01:15.886
A lot of people today? Yes.

01:15.969 --> 01:17.595
It was good?

01:21.224 --> 01:23.226
- Let's say $ 60.
- All right.

01:45.665 --> 01:46.709
Double! Yes.

01:47.459 --> 01:50.879
Kings and sevens. Kings and sevens win.

01:50.963 --> 01:52.923
- Very good hand.
- Thank you gentlemen.

01:53.006 --> 01:55.467
- You play to win.
- Yes, well ordered.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.594
He asked for three letters.

01:59.262 --> 02:01.431
Here the new hand begins.

02:02.099 --> 02:03.641
I did not see him coming.

02:06.644 --> 02:08.354
Well, it's $ 25 per head.

02:11.024 --> 02:12.025
Thank you.

02:13.485 --> 02:15.362
Fifteen. It happened.

02:18.198 --> 02:21.409
- That's twenty.
- It's okay.

02:23.245 --> 02:25.038
Good morning, Eddie. Bad night?

02:59.739 --> 03:02.325
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

03:02.575 --> 03:03.994
- All right.
- I'm glad.

03:04.912 --> 03:05.912
All good?

03:06.621 --> 03:08.540
Yes, all right. What happened?

03:08.623 --> 03:11.376
Nothing. I can not pay you now.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.086
- It's not enough.
- Wait. Hears.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.171
- Do not!
- I know.

03:14.254 --> 03:16.298
- Stop. Every day...
- Adrian, Mira.

03:17.007 --> 03:18.008
No, that's enough.

03:18.091 --> 03:19.176
Adrian, please.

03:19.259 --> 03:21.719
- I was making $ 200.
- Do not.

03:21.804 --> 03:23.430
- Enough, Victor.
- Yes please.

03:23.513 --> 03:24.514
Do not.

03:24.597 --> 03:25.974
I'll do? Do not pay you.

03:26.641 --> 03:27.893
- I am sorry.
- Good.

03:28.726 --> 03:30.687
I will starve.

03:31.604 --> 03:33.857
- I do not care.
- How come? If you care.

03:33.941 --> 03:35.108
- Do not.
- Do you mind.

03:35.192 --> 03:36.392
- No, not anymore.
- All right.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.320
I'll pay you by the end of the week.
Guaranteed.

03:38.403 --> 03:40.238
- Stop it, Victor!
- I'll pay you.

03:40.322 --> 03:41.907
- Yes please.
- Victor!

03:44.034 --> 03:45.243
Cone!

04:00.175 --> 04:01.676
Very good.

04:10.352 --> 04:11.686
Good heavens!

04:11.769 --> 04:13.688
- I scared you?
- What are you doing here?

04:13.771 --> 04:16.411
- Forgives. I did not want to scare you.
- What are you doing here?

04:16.483 --> 04:18.986
I came to say hello.
You were not home and I went in.

04:19.069 --> 04:20.528
I do not owe you anything.

04:20.612 --> 04:22.530
- Not a penny.
- Who said yes?

04:22.614 --> 04:23.991
You owe me nothing.

04:24.074 --> 04:25.909
Come on. Enter the dining room.

04:26.743 --> 04:27.911
Come with me.

04:28.661 --> 04:31.664
- How are you?
- A little scared, but good.

04:32.665 --> 04:33.708
What was there?

04:33.792 --> 04:35.335
I have a business proposal.

04:35.836 --> 04:37.087
- I hear you.
- Very good.

04:37.170 --> 04:40.507
I will be away for a while.
I'm sent to prison.

04:42.384 --> 04:43.635
While not,

04:45.053 --> 04:46.388
there is something here.

04:47.472 --> 04:48.849
I need you to save it.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.810
I do not want the police to have it.

04:52.895 --> 04:55.772
Neither my friends nor
anyone, you understand?

04:55.856 --> 04:56.982
I understand.

04:57.900 --> 04:58.984
I'll be out.

04:59.609 --> 05:02.529
About six or nine months.
We do not know yet.

05:03.738 --> 05:06.241
When you leave, you give me the bag.

05:07.159 --> 05:08.869
And I give you $ 10,000 in cash.

05:08.952 --> 05:10.537
$ 10,000?

05:10.620 --> 05:11.663
What's in the bag?

05:11.746 --> 05:13.456
Do not worry about it.

05:13.540 --> 05:17.419
Do not open it. Do not look at her. Do not
touch her. Do not even think about Ella.

05:17.502 --> 05:20.047
Hide it and forget it. That is all.

05:21.173 --> 05:24.676
Shit, Michael.
It's an interesting opportunity.

05:27.512 --> 05:28.805
One could say, yes.

05:31.558 --> 05:32.684
Yes?

05:32.767 --> 05:34.352
- Done deal.
- Very good.

05:34.436 --> 05:35.437
- Done.
- Done.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.855
- All right. Ray!
- I'm your man.

05:40.733 --> 05:42.527
<i>Eddie, it's Ron.</i>

05:42.610 --> 05:43.946
<i>I do not know if you remember me.</i>

05:44.029 --> 05:46.239
<i>I left your mother's
vagina before you.</i>

05:46.323 --> 05:48.908
<i>We grew up together. I am your brother.</i>

05:48.992 --> 05:51.869
<i>Hi. Where are you?</i>

05:51.954 --> 05:54.706
<i>We have not seen you in weeks,
and we'd like to see you.</i>

05:54.789 --> 05:57.000
<i>We miss you. Your nephew misses you.</i>

05:57.083 --> 05:59.502
<i>Call us. Let's dine together. Bye.</i>

06:00.420 --> 06:01.421
Hi.

06:01.504 --> 06:03.756
Do what seems right to you.

06:03.840 --> 06:04.924
Follow your instinct.

06:05.008 --> 06:07.219
- Trust your instinct.
- It's a great decision.

06:07.302 --> 06:09.387
Very well, I will.

06:09.554 --> 06:12.390
Yes!

06:12.474 --> 06:13.850
- Special caramel!
- All right.

06:15.310 --> 06:17.354
- Uncle Eddie...
- Nice to see you.

06:17.437 --> 06:18.855
How are you?

06:18.938 --> 06:20.440
Very good.

06:20.523 --> 06:21.608
Yes? Yes.

06:21.691 --> 06:23.110
What have you done lately?

06:23.193 --> 06:25.612
Work, have fun, save and...

06:25.695 --> 06:27.447
Do not you park cars?

06:27.530 --> 06:30.117
Are you parking cars? Yes.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.243
- Not every day.
- Look!

06:31.326 --> 06:34.746
Last season you said
it would be the last.

06:34.829 --> 06:38.500
But this year the cubs
are doing very well.

06:38.583 --> 06:41.086
People want to go and see them.
There are more opportunities.

06:41.169 --> 06:43.713
And I do not reject the
money, so I accepted the job.

06:43.796 --> 06:46.258
- In fact...
- Were you working...?

06:46.341 --> 06:48.221
Were not you going to
open a restaurant or bar?

06:48.245 --> 06:51.554
Arthur and I were going
to open a private bar.

06:51.638 --> 06:55.308
We are still talking about it.

06:56.351 --> 06:58.353
- Follow.
- We care about your career.

06:58.436 --> 07:00.355
That you can keep
it economically.

07:00.438 --> 07:02.149
I know. Actually...

07:02.232 --> 07:04.442
I started a business. Thanks for asking.

07:04.526 --> 07:07.487
- You started a business?
- A storage business.

07:07.570 --> 07:08.696
Storage?

07:08.780 --> 07:10.448
Yes, I started... I already have...

07:10.532 --> 07:12.450
It is not an idea. It is real.
I have a client.

07:12.534 --> 07:13.618
- Look!
- What?

07:13.701 --> 07:14.827
What do you say?

07:14.911 --> 07:19.332
I have a client who
paid me for six months.

07:19.416 --> 07:21.751
I'm looking for more customers.

07:21.834 --> 07:22.914
What are you talking about?

07:22.938 --> 07:24.421
- It's strange.
- What is strange?

07:24.504 --> 07:26.173
- Help me.
- I need a job.

07:26.256 --> 07:27.382
Help me with the trash.

07:27.465 --> 07:29.217
I did not come to talk about it.

07:29.301 --> 07:30.343
Good...

07:30.427 --> 07:32.387
- I came to be with you.
- Very good.

07:32.470 --> 07:33.471
Do not get mad.

07:33.555 --> 07:34.764
- No but...
- Look.

07:34.847 --> 07:36.641
Do not let it affect you. He loves you.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.810
And I her. You know that.

07:38.893 --> 07:39.977
I know you know it.

07:40.062 --> 07:42.064
Yes, but almost... you know?

07:42.147 --> 07:44.399
I know. We care about you.

07:45.608 --> 07:46.609
A lot.

07:48.736 --> 07:51.198
At some point you will have to mature.

07:51.281 --> 07:53.533
And act as an adult.
I'm serious.

07:53.616 --> 07:55.493
You will not be able to
continue at this rate.

07:56.411 --> 07:57.454
Listen to me.

07:57.537 --> 07:59.747
I know I repeat myself.
Come and work for me.

08:00.373 --> 08:03.918
Please. He would have loved to
have his children work with him.

08:04.001 --> 08:05.795
Come on. He would have loved it.

08:05.878 --> 08:08.840
- I do not want...
- Security and stability.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.676
You would have a salary.
You would spend money as you wanted.

08:11.759 --> 08:16.098
- You would have a support.
- I will not work at the chip company.

08:16.181 --> 08:18.766
- You must build your life.
- Ron, shut up.

08:18.850 --> 08:20.690
- It's great!
- I do not want to be a gardener.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.248
I do not want to make a career there.

08:22.272 --> 08:24.897
What is wrong with the company?
They built it!

08:24.981 --> 08:27.150
I love what dad did.

08:27.234 --> 08:29.861
It's not what I want. That is all.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.323
You can not give me a
joint and then a sermon.

08:33.405 --> 08:35.326
- That's how you are.
- I do not smoke so much...

08:35.408 --> 08:37.952
- "Stop!".
- Stop.

08:38.035 --> 08:41.498
"I can not smoke and think about my life."
Me drugs.

08:41.623 --> 08:43.041
And now lecture me.

09:11.986 --> 09:12.987
Shit.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.616
Makes some delicious cookies.

09:38.305 --> 09:39.306
Do not.

09:42.559 --> 09:43.935
Do not do it, idiot.

09:47.814 --> 09:48.898
Do not do it.

09:50.775 --> 09:52.277
Do not get into this.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.030
Do not do it.

09:57.365 --> 09:59.909
- Did Jake hear anything?
- No, I look at things.

09:59.992 --> 10:02.162
Bodybuilding and all that.

10:02.245 --> 10:03.705
- Oh, my god.
- Wow...

10:04.622 --> 10:06.374
- I am sorry.
- It would have been the end.

10:06.458 --> 10:07.625
It's a great story.

10:08.543 --> 10:10.920
It was not a story.
It really is.

10:11.003 --> 10:12.964
What do we have here? A sandwich?

10:13.047 --> 10:14.048
Twenty.

10:14.131 --> 10:15.592
More a sandwich.

10:17.469 --> 10:19.596
I need to buy gas.

10:21.055 --> 10:22.682
Good shot.

10:32.692 --> 10:33.693
Do not do it.

10:36.237 --> 10:37.237
Do not.

10:40.158 --> 10:41.158
Do not.

10:44.662 --> 10:45.830
Gross.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.125
What's up?

11:06.726 --> 11:09.103
Shit.

11:10.313 --> 11:11.939
Do not.

11:13.232 --> 11:14.692
Do not.

11:16.236 --> 11:17.612
Do not.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.156
Do not.

11:22.825 --> 11:25.662
What the fuck.

11:27.246 --> 11:28.998
Do not.

11:35.797 --> 11:37.256
This is not good.

11:39.926 --> 11:41.260
It is not...

11:43.846 --> 11:45.097
Fuck.

11:45.682 --> 11:49.477
Pancake house and restaurant.

11:49.561 --> 11:52.647
The fact that you are
considering this plan.

11:53.481 --> 11:56.567
Means that in three weeks there
will be no money left in that bag.

11:56.651 --> 12:00.154
Is not true.
This is going to have a happy ending.

12:00.237 --> 12:01.948
There will be no happy ending.
Yes.

12:02.031 --> 12:03.825
You never have a happy ending.

12:03.908 --> 12:05.493
It's a loser attitude.

12:05.577 --> 12:08.371
Every story you've told
me since I met you.

12:08.455 --> 12:11.290
It's about how you were
here and you ended up here.

12:11.374 --> 12:12.625
Because you're my best man.

12:12.709 --> 12:14.461
Am I going to boast?

12:14.544 --> 12:15.795
Most are victories.

12:15.878 --> 12:17.422
- Who's your godfather?
- Your.

12:18.233 --> 12:19.233
I?

12:19.257 --> 12:20.300
Is not true.

12:20.383 --> 12:22.093
- Yes.
- I'm not your godfather.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.715
You have not been to a
meeting in six months.

12:24.727 --> 12:26.889
Here is a system,
with concrete rules.

12:26.973 --> 12:28.558
I'll tell you who I am.

12:28.641 --> 12:30.768
I'm a guy you take to coffee shops.

12:30.852 --> 12:33.270
Tell him the nonsense
you're going to do.

12:33.355 --> 12:36.399
You expect me to accept them
so as not to feel guilty.

12:36.483 --> 12:37.609
My godfather.

12:37.692 --> 12:40.194
Did you learn that in the program?
What I said...

12:40.277 --> 12:42.447
So you think he's a godfather?

12:42.530 --> 12:45.533
I just want to get $ 500
off the bag and bet.

12:45.617 --> 12:47.243
As soon as he wins,

12:47.326 --> 12:51.373
I will return the $ 500 to
the bag and I will keep it.

12:51.456 --> 12:55.752
You are a loser. You never won.
You always lose.

12:55.835 --> 12:58.921
- A top-notch loser!
- Is not true.

12:59.005 --> 13:03.134
That is what you are.
Pure flesh of a loser.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.720
- You're not going to make any money!
- Maybe yes.

13:05.803 --> 13:06.971
- Do not...
- If I return it,

13:07.054 --> 13:09.391
and is feasible, what is the problem?

13:09.474 --> 13:11.350
If you get $ 500, you'll get another $ 500.

13:11.434 --> 13:13.686
- No. My limit...
- You will do it.

13:13.770 --> 13:15.938
My limit is $ 500.
Then I do not touch it.

13:16.022 --> 13:19.358
90% of what you said since
we sat down is nonsense!

13:19.442 --> 13:22.945
Gene, it's an opportunity
like I've never had.

13:23.029 --> 13:24.989
I've never had so much cash.

13:25.072 --> 13:28.493
The opportunity you have is to
leave the bag in the closet,

13:29.411 --> 13:31.788
do not do shit.

13:31.871 --> 13:35.166
And collect money at the end, without risk.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.292
Do you see it?

13:36.375 --> 13:38.670
- You see?
- Yeah, I'm glad I called you.

13:38.753 --> 13:40.505
I will not touch money.

13:40.588 --> 13:41.589
Will not you touch it?

13:41.673 --> 13:42.913
Thank you. I will not touch it.

13:42.965 --> 13:45.092
- Fabulous.
- It's over. I needed it.

13:45.176 --> 13:46.177
Thank you.

14:01.526 --> 14:04.028
It's okay. I see.

14:10.076 --> 14:12.745
Twenty one! Very good!

14:14.163 --> 14:15.372
Nine.

14:20.878 --> 14:23.255
- Any beer.
- Right now.

14:45.277 --> 14:48.239
Yes!

14:48.322 --> 14:49.824
I told you!

14:52.243 --> 14:53.536
All this is for you.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.705
Leave it close. Immediately
i come for more.

14:55.788 --> 14:56.831
- Yes.
- Thank you, Paul.

15:04.547 --> 15:05.590
Yes sir!

15:05.673 --> 15:06.966
Let's drink! All night.

15:07.049 --> 15:08.718
I invite. Yes.

15:09.802 --> 15:12.388
I was scared. He was terrified.

15:12.472 --> 15:15.391
But it was fixed.
I returned everything and won two.

15:15.475 --> 15:18.394
Now that I've won two, it's like...

15:19.145 --> 15:21.022
- I can jump.
- It's easy money.

15:21.105 --> 15:21.981
Of course you can.

15:22.064 --> 15:24.150
If I lose, I will be the
same as when I started.

15:24.233 --> 15:27.487
Let's celebrate. Thanks for coming.
I'm glad they left.

15:27.570 --> 15:31.365
I needed this. It feels...

15:31.448 --> 15:33.618
- You deserve it.
- I deserve it.

15:33.701 --> 15:36.037
Thanks guys.
Take another. All night.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.454
Tell them what I pay.

15:37.539 --> 15:39.206
Paul, I paid tonight.

15:39.290 --> 15:40.124
- Yes!
- Paul!

15:40.207 --> 15:41.417
- A beer.
- Other?

15:41.501 --> 15:42.960
- Yes.
- A bag of cookies.

15:46.005 --> 15:47.840
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

15:51.761 --> 15:53.304
Forgives.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.347
Agree. Sorry.

16:09.111 --> 16:10.362
After you.

16:14.283 --> 16:17.411
The location is the key.
My uncle has a place...

16:17.494 --> 16:21.248
Ahead. Call your uncle.
Tell him it's for real. We will do it.

16:26.170 --> 16:27.755
- Hello.
- What's up?

16:27.839 --> 16:30.675
Serve another round of
drinks to those ladies.

16:30.758 --> 16:31.968
I invite.

16:32.051 --> 16:33.595
Your? That good. Yes.

16:33.678 --> 16:35.847
You have to go and take them.

16:36.764 --> 16:39.100
- I'm not at the tables.
- Do it for me.

16:39.183 --> 16:41.310
Do it. When they
ask from whom...

16:41.393 --> 16:42.604
The bar is full.

16:42.687 --> 16:44.188
It will take you a minute.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.511
Are they going to demand that
you serve them right away?

16:46.535 --> 16:47.274
Do me the favor.

16:47.358 --> 16:51.195
How many times have you come? When did
i leave the bar and take the tables?

16:51.278 --> 16:53.906
I'll ask you... I'll pay you.
I'll give you $ 20.

16:54.824 --> 16:56.242
I'll give you $ 20 just for that.

16:56.325 --> 16:57.994
And I'll pay for the drinks, too.

17:01.413 --> 17:03.499
No. We did not ask for that.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.251
I know. They are on his side.

17:05.334 --> 17:06.961
- Do you know him?
- Do not.

17:07.044 --> 17:08.963
I'm going.

17:10.214 --> 17:12.383
This is because I almost killed you.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.467
Careless.

17:13.550 --> 17:16.553
How are you? I've never
seen them here before.

17:16.637 --> 17:17.638
These are my friends.

17:17.722 --> 17:20.266
- Gentlemen! Introduce yourself.
- Hello.

17:20.767 --> 17:23.435
We may be many.
Tonight, I pay for the drinks.

17:23.519 --> 17:24.686
- All right.
- Totally.

17:24.771 --> 17:26.188
Why not? If you say it.

17:26.271 --> 17:28.107
- Eddie.
- Hello. Eve.

17:28.190 --> 17:29.734
- Nice to meet you, Eva.
- Equally.

17:29.817 --> 17:31.360
- Sorry about that before.
- I'm sorry.

17:36.448 --> 17:38.034
All!

17:57.428 --> 17:59.764
- Play here.
- Agree.

17:59.847 --> 18:01.057
- It is normal.
- Very good.

18:01.140 --> 18:02.266
Touch it. Yes.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.349
And so...

18:04.226 --> 18:05.436
Heavens!

18:06.437 --> 18:07.897
- What is that?
- Seriously.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.774
It's huge, is not it?

18:09.857 --> 18:11.818
You have a sweet heart. Noticeable.

18:11.901 --> 18:13.820
- It comes from music.
- Really?

18:13.903 --> 18:15.988
Your way of dancing to the beat of music.

18:16.072 --> 18:17.531
That's what changes everything.

18:17.614 --> 18:19.116
Thanks for saying so.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.617
No one had told me.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.287
Press it. Come on.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.372
- Go with the black woman.
- Which do you like?

18:26.373 --> 18:27.373
Which do you like?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.085
The black one.

18:30.127 --> 18:31.754
Tell me about your friend Eddie.

18:32.421 --> 18:33.840
Mary...

18:33.923 --> 18:36.342
- Eddie? What do you want to know? Look.
- I don't know.

18:36.425 --> 18:38.761
He's talking to my friend. Yes.

18:40.805 --> 18:42.223
True?

18:42.306 --> 18:46.143
You. Are they nurses?
They work together.

18:46.227 --> 18:48.896
- Yes.
- Great.

18:49.521 --> 18:51.774
- Interesting.
- I know.

18:53.192 --> 18:56.112
Why do you like to take care of people?

18:56.779 --> 18:58.655
I always wanted to.

18:58.740 --> 19:00.700
Yes? Yes.

19:00.783 --> 19:04.536
You have a huge muscle.
You can do whatever you want with it.

19:04.620 --> 19:07.999
I don't know. I like to
take care of people.

19:08.082 --> 19:10.209
And I like... the best... yeah?

19:10.292 --> 19:11.836
What I enjoy of my work.

19:11.919 --> 19:17.800
Is to teach people to
take care of themselves.

19:17.884 --> 19:20.302
- Interesting.
- It's an attractive quality.

19:29.771 --> 19:31.147
Well, friends.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.400
Yes.

19:35.712 --> 19:36.712
Yes?

19:36.736 --> 19:38.487
You must go home. I am sorry.

19:38.570 --> 19:40.156
- Agree.
- If it's late.

19:46.287 --> 19:49.415
I've always been here
since high school.

19:49.498 --> 19:50.541
Really? Yes.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.251
Can it be to take away? Yes.

19:52.334 --> 19:54.211
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

19:54.295 --> 19:55.797
<i>I'm a nerd </i>.

19:56.964 --> 19:59.300
A very disciplined nerd.

19:59.383 --> 20:03.387
- Have you always been disciplined?
- Yes always.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.721
How good.

20:04.806 --> 20:06.348
Do you believe? Yes.

20:06.432 --> 20:08.059
Why did you go out tonight?

20:09.185 --> 20:11.520
My friends insisted.

20:11.603 --> 20:15.149
- They said I'm bored and...
- Yes, but why today?

20:15.900 --> 20:17.902
- Because today you went out.
- I don't know.

20:17.985 --> 20:20.905
You decided to go to that bar.
Why tonight?

20:22.114 --> 20:23.950
It's a nice coincidence.

20:24.909 --> 20:26.410
I do not believe in coincidences.

20:26.493 --> 20:29.496
Really, I do not believe in them.

20:29.580 --> 20:32.624
I think everything happens for a reason.

20:32.708 --> 20:33.918
Yes me too.

20:34.001 --> 20:36.753
I was very lucky today.

20:36.838 --> 20:38.464
And so,

20:39.465 --> 20:42.343
you decided to leave and you never go out!

20:42.426 --> 20:45.471
And you went to that shitty bar.
Yes.

20:46.722 --> 20:49.516
Really. What is the probability?

20:50.434 --> 20:51.768
I do not know, but it was great.

20:51.853 --> 20:54.396
It would not be repeated
in a million years!

20:55.898 --> 20:58.317
I don't know. I find it exciting.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.863
Sometimes, the world is perfect.

21:02.905 --> 21:04.323
- I know.
- Other times, no.

21:04.406 --> 21:07.784
Most of the time, no.
But when it is...

21:07.869 --> 21:09.703
- You speak like crazy, but...
- Yes?

21:09.786 --> 21:11.330
- I like it.
- Very good.

21:12.832 --> 21:14.708
I had a great time.

21:14.791 --> 21:15.792
I know.

21:15.877 --> 21:18.129
- I had a great time with you.
- I also.

21:18.212 --> 21:20.172
- We could repeat it.
- Of course.

21:20.256 --> 21:21.465
- You want?
- May l...

21:21.548 --> 21:23.009
I can give you my number.

21:23.092 --> 21:24.426
- Yes.
- Yes?

21:24.510 --> 21:28.014
I'll give you my phone. Mark it,

21:28.097 --> 21:30.224
and I'll call you. Yes.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.396
We could have breakfast one of these days.

21:35.479 --> 21:38.440
I'm not very early riser.

21:38.524 --> 21:42.778
Do you ever go out to lunch
or have a drink? Or...

21:42.862 --> 21:44.321
I am very busy.

21:44.405 --> 21:45.531
- Yes?
- So...

21:45.614 --> 21:47.533
I'm only free in the morning. I am sorry.

21:47.616 --> 21:50.161
- That is all? Only in the morning.
- And very early.

21:50.244 --> 21:53.539
- How early?
- At 7:00 or 7:30.

21:53.622 --> 21:54.623
- It's okay.
- Yes?

21:54.706 --> 21:56.292
- It's okay?
- Yes cool.

21:56.375 --> 21:58.377
- Agree?
- Then yes.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.254
I'm impatient for... yes.

22:01.172 --> 22:02.381
See you in the morning.

22:03.132 --> 22:05.885
I will call you. We'll meet.
We'll pick one day.

22:05.968 --> 22:07.303
- Perfect.
- Very good.

22:42.213 --> 22:45.591
Today is the day, Eddie.

22:47.259 --> 22:48.927
Today is the day.

22:54.642 --> 22:56.810
They should run on the
lawn, but not today.

22:56.893 --> 22:58.687
- They run on sand.
- All right.

22:58.770 --> 23:00.689
- Should not have problems.
- Great.

23:00.773 --> 23:03.400
Kit's in the fifth, right?

23:03.484 --> 23:04.902
Yes.
All right. In the seventh...

23:13.785 --> 23:14.786
<i>Hi. How are you?</i>

23:24.838 --> 23:26.715
Come on!

23:27.633 --> 23:29.218
Do it!

23:29.301 --> 23:30.927
Just!

23:41.813 --> 23:44.108
Yes. You know what? I'll bring it.

23:44.191 --> 23:46.818
- Come on! Run!
- Go!

23:47.611 --> 23:48.945
Heavens.

23:49.030 --> 23:50.281
Maybe we will win.

23:52.533 --> 23:54.743
Come on!

24:20.561 --> 24:21.562
Nicky.

24:22.479 --> 24:23.480
Hi.

24:24.398 --> 24:26.275
I need a favor, my friend.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.611
Do you still have the keys to my house?

24:35.742 --> 24:38.079
- What about the rain?
- A storm is coming.

24:38.162 --> 24:40.372
- Will they postpone the race?
- They 're suspended.

24:40.456 --> 24:42.291
Yes? Shit. It's a joke?

24:43.292 --> 24:45.336
Agree. Thank you. Shit.

24:54.970 --> 24:57.806
It's a nightmare, damn it!

25:38.305 --> 25:39.556
I can enter?

25:39.640 --> 25:40.641
Yes.

25:41.267 --> 25:46.438
Two three four five six seven...

25:46.522 --> 25:48.274
You want it all in chips? Yes.

25:48.357 --> 25:50.025
One, two, three, four, sir.

25:50.108 --> 25:51.402
- Yes, give me three.
- Three?

25:51.485 --> 25:52.986
One, two and three.

25:53.069 --> 25:55.281
Show them. We match.

25:55.364 --> 25:57.491
- Damned...
- Kings and three.

25:57.574 --> 25:59.451
Double pairs. Nothing?

25:59.535 --> 26:02.204
We have another $ 250.

26:02.329 --> 26:04.164
- They all match.
- Another one.

26:04.248 --> 26:05.332
I also match.

26:05.415 --> 26:07.334
- The well is fine.
- What, not even?

26:07.417 --> 26:08.252
How many letters?

26:08.335 --> 26:11.046
A. If you give me the one i
need, I'll take all the money.

26:12.589 --> 26:14.109
- The biggest hand.
- I put everything.

26:14.133 --> 26:16.051
- Motherfucker.
- Couple of nines.

26:18.304 --> 26:21.682
You're good. Quiet.

26:22.433 --> 26:25.686
I stay and I get it back.

26:32.276 --> 26:33.694
All in chips? Yes.

26:33.777 --> 26:36.655
- He is okay?
- Great.

26:36.738 --> 26:38.907
Give me the chips, please. Thank you.

26:38.990 --> 26:41.410
- He passed.
- He passed.

26:41.493 --> 26:42.578
Four up.

26:43.954 --> 26:45.080
Pair of eights.

26:45.163 --> 26:46.957
Pair of aces, that wins.

26:50.752 --> 26:52.879
- I see.
- I see.

26:52.963 --> 26:55.424
It is the parallel well. $ 500.

27:02.598 --> 27:03.599
Two.

27:04.516 --> 27:07.185
- One two. You want letters.
- Three.

27:07.269 --> 27:09.104
And three nice letters.

27:09.187 --> 27:13.400
Someone sees and climbs.

27:13.484 --> 27:16.403
We have $ 400 plus $ 1,100.
The bet is $ 1500.

27:16.487 --> 27:17.488
It's too much for me.

27:17.571 --> 27:19.448
The bet is $ 1,500.

27:19.531 --> 27:21.950
<i>Wait. I have not seen it yet.</i>

27:22.033 --> 27:23.702
<i>Do you see it or do you retire?</i>

27:23.785 --> 27:26.455
We see the hand. He shows them.

27:26.538 --> 27:28.081
Yes. Strong bets.

27:28.999 --> 27:30.459
- Damned.
- It's a joke?

27:31.167 --> 27:33.670
It has a full, gentlemen.

27:33.754 --> 27:34.796
Amazing.

27:35.547 --> 27:38.259
This is yours, my friend. All yours.

27:38.342 --> 27:40.302
I had never seen anything like it.

27:41.387 --> 27:42.721
Amazing.

28:05.536 --> 28:10.541
Eva: "Is breakfast still?"

28:17.714 --> 28:19.215
Looks like you rested.

28:19.300 --> 28:21.635
Did you have a good night? What did you do?

28:22.553 --> 28:23.679
If I...

28:25.639 --> 28:30.268
I took my daughter and watched
television with my mom.

28:31.186 --> 28:32.313
So yes.

28:32.396 --> 28:33.397
Great.

28:34.523 --> 28:36.149
A daughter. Yes.

28:38.109 --> 28:41.822
How...? How old are you?

28:41.905 --> 28:43.156
Seven.

28:43.239 --> 28:44.283
Seven?

28:44.366 --> 28:45.534
It's already big.

28:47.703 --> 28:49.871
The father...?

28:49.955 --> 28:52.416
Are you married to him, or...?

28:53.334 --> 28:54.335
Do not.

28:54.418 --> 28:56.336
She... that is, he...

28:56.795 --> 29:00.507
He got lost in Mexico forever.

29:00.591 --> 29:01.883
What?

29:01.967 --> 29:06.054
Is that normal in Mexico?
Get lost forever.

29:06.137 --> 29:07.263
It's awful.

29:08.890 --> 29:10.809
- He's not with us.
- No this...

29:10.892 --> 29:14.605
It is there, and it will never come.

29:14.688 --> 29:16.440
We have no contact.

29:16.523 --> 29:21.945
That is a relief for someone.
For me, I suppose.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.989
But maybe not for you, and I'm sorry.

29:24.072 --> 29:28.118
Really? Because three women...
Its a lot...

29:28.201 --> 29:30.161
- Yes it is much.
- To assume it.

29:30.245 --> 29:32.914
You are ready? I do not think so.

29:32.998 --> 29:37.043
How about if we eat breakfast
and see if we like the food?

29:37.961 --> 29:40.046
Then we'll think about all that.

29:40.190 --> 29:41.190
You're right.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.924
- Sorry for the wait.
- Thank you.

29:43.008 --> 29:45.719
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes please. Just coffee.

29:45.844 --> 29:46.844
You, lady?

29:47.388 --> 29:49.640
- Orange juice. Thank you.
- To you.

29:49.765 --> 29:56.271
I think it's great that you
start breakfast like this.

29:56.355 --> 29:59.107
I was not entirely honest that night.

29:59.190 --> 30:00.567
I do not have my own business.

30:00.651 --> 30:03.695
I do not spend much.
I do not usually have that much money.

30:03.779 --> 30:04.780
Agree.

30:04.863 --> 30:05.697
So...

30:05.781 --> 30:09.242
And if it's not what you
expected, I'm sorry. I cheated.

30:10.326 --> 30:11.703
How do you win the life?

30:11.787 --> 30:13.372
How do I make a living? Yes.

30:14.414 --> 30:15.832
It is difficult to know today.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.419
But after passing...

30:18.502 --> 30:20.504
You do not seem shy at all.

30:20.587 --> 30:21.630
Not really.

30:21.713 --> 30:24.132
Because you are different.
I do not know why.

30:24.216 --> 30:27.260
When you meet someone,
you are extroverted.

30:27.343 --> 30:28.554
Yes, exactly.

30:28.637 --> 30:31.682
If I do not know them, I'm very shy.

30:31.765 --> 30:33.975
<i>- I am sorry.
- Gene, do not do that.</i>

30:35.394 --> 30:36.395
Please.

30:39.189 --> 30:41.107
That was a week ago.

30:41.191 --> 30:43.234
- Gene...
- We talked a week ago.

30:43.318 --> 30:46.321
I am sorry. I should not laugh.

30:46.405 --> 30:47.781
I should not laugh.

30:49.616 --> 30:51.618
- Gene.
- I am sorry. Is that...

30:51.702 --> 30:54.079
- I'm at my worst.
- I know. I am sorry.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.164
Help me, I beg you.

30:56.248 --> 30:58.583
- Agree. I know.
- You're laughing at me.

30:59.501 --> 31:02.713
Are you willing to change?

31:02.796 --> 31:04.548
Yes, 100%

31:04.631 --> 31:05.924
- really?
- Yes, 100%.

31:06.007 --> 31:08.469
Are not you going to stay
here complaining and saying,

31:08.552 --> 31:12.305
"i made bad decisions,"
then rejected my advice?

31:12.388 --> 31:16.602
- This is different.
- But do you understand why I say it?

31:16.685 --> 31:18.285
Do you understand my restlessness?
Yes.

31:18.309 --> 31:21.607
Because you did it 4268
times in the past.

31:21.690 --> 31:23.024
This is... yes.

31:23.108 --> 31:25.861
I am totally willing to change.
I'm scared.

31:25.944 --> 31:28.113
I never thought this would happen.

31:28.196 --> 31:29.196
- Please.
- Good.

31:29.239 --> 31:31.575
Lets start by the beginning.

31:31.658 --> 31:35.829
You must admit that you're an idiot.

31:36.412 --> 31:38.039
I admit that I'm an idiot.

31:38.624 --> 31:43.086
I need you to say:
"My name is... and I'm an idiot."

31:43.169 --> 31:44.420
Why?

31:44.504 --> 31:47.382
Because that statement is real.
It becomes real.

31:47.466 --> 31:50.426
If you are willing to humiliate yourself,
i will know that you are serious.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.597
My name is Edward Garrett
and I'm an idiot.

31:53.680 --> 31:56.517
All right. And now I want you to say:

31:56.600 --> 32:00.061
"My name was Edward Garrett
and my friend gene was right."

32:00.145 --> 32:03.439
- I'm addicted to losing.
- Why do I have to say this about you?

32:03.524 --> 32:04.525
Agree.

32:05.441 --> 32:09.946
My name is Edward Garrett and
my friend gene was right.

32:10.030 --> 32:11.490
I'm addicted to losing.

32:11.573 --> 32:13.575
- That was easy for you.
- Yes, you were right.

32:13.659 --> 32:16.202
You must have serious problems.
Yes.

32:16.286 --> 32:17.328
Agree.

32:18.580 --> 32:21.958
If you laugh after all
that, I'll kill you.

32:22.876 --> 32:26.588
Gene, this behavior is inappropriate.

32:26.672 --> 32:27.714
I am sorry.

32:27.798 --> 32:30.509
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. It makes me laugh.

32:30.592 --> 32:33.637
- You're a bad person.
- It is not my intention. Is that...

32:34.345 --> 32:37.182
It's not funny.

32:37.265 --> 32:39.309
All right. We'll fix it.

32:39.392 --> 32:40.894
I do not understand. We'll fix it.

32:40.977 --> 32:43.605
We'll do whatever it takes.
We'll get you up.

32:43.689 --> 32:45.023
- Agree?
- Yes thanks.

32:51.237 --> 32:52.781
How many did you throw?

32:53.406 --> 32:57.285
Six? All right. Nothing happens.
We can do it.

32:57.368 --> 32:59.079
I have to ask for them.

32:59.162 --> 33:00.539
Do you want me to go out?

33:00.622 --> 33:01.832
No, it's no problem.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.918
Julio is leaving.
I'll ask you to do it.

33:05.001 --> 33:06.127
All right. Bye, Kim.

33:07.045 --> 33:08.547
- Hello.
- Hello.

33:08.630 --> 33:10.298
- How are you?
- No good.

33:11.466 --> 33:12.676
What's going on?

33:13.677 --> 33:14.678
I...

33:16.888 --> 33:21.392
I'm in a shit situation
and I feel ashamed.

33:22.310 --> 33:25.647
And I... what is it, Eddie?

33:28.066 --> 33:33.154
I ended up losing money I did not have.
I owe more than $ 20,000.

33:33.238 --> 33:34.865
- I do not have $ 20,000.
- I know.

33:34.948 --> 33:37.200
- It's ridiculous!
- I'm not asking for a loan.

33:37.283 --> 33:40.453
I'm not begging you.
That ended. Yes?

33:40.537 --> 33:41.663
What did you come for?

33:41.913 --> 33:44.291
I'm going to go to meetings
and I'm going to change.

33:44.374 --> 33:45.375
I want employment.

33:45.458 --> 33:46.627
I want to work for you.

33:47.377 --> 33:48.712
Do you want to work for me?

33:50.881 --> 33:52.007
Seriously? Yes.

33:53.049 --> 33:54.760
- Very good.
- I need...

33:54.843 --> 33:58.054
- Bottoms out. I know.
- Agree.

33:58.847 --> 34:00.056
This is what we will do.

34:00.974 --> 34:02.684
- I'll offer you a job.
- Thank you.

34:02.768 --> 34:05.270
You will start from below, as
you would have wanted chips.

34:05.353 --> 34:06.271
- Clear.
- Yes?

34:06.354 --> 34:07.939
No weekly rest. Yes.

34:08.023 --> 34:09.274
I will not give you anything.

34:09.357 --> 34:10.984
I'll make you work hard, okay?
Yes.

34:11.902 --> 34:17.032
If you do well, no problems
or excuses for six months,

34:17.114 --> 34:23.079
I will lend you the part of the debt
that you do not cover with labor.

34:23.163 --> 34:24.664
It's more than I ask, Ron.

34:24.748 --> 34:27.667
It's what I give you, what
you take and what there is.

34:27.751 --> 34:29.335
Are you going to work for me?
Yes.

34:29.418 --> 34:31.462
- Seriously?
- There will be no problems.

34:31.545 --> 34:35.007
I'm sure there will be no problems.
Yes?

34:35.091 --> 34:36.301
Very good.

34:36.384 --> 34:37.552
Let's do it. Yes.

34:37.636 --> 34:39.846
- I'm glad you're here.
- Thank you.

34:39.929 --> 34:42.473
- Seriously, no nonsense. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:42.556 --> 34:44.475
You're welcome. Good.

34:44.559 --> 34:46.393
It is done.

34:46.476 --> 34:49.648
Because I can not take it anymore.
My heart can not stand it.

34:49.731 --> 34:51.900
- It's the last time we do it.
- It's over.

34:51.983 --> 34:53.234
If I'm sure.

35:08.416 --> 35:10.376
I get it. Yes.

35:13.463 --> 35:17.008
Very good. Shut up.

35:51.710 --> 35:53.503
Here's the guy.

35:53.586 --> 35:54.963
Here it comes.

35:55.046 --> 35:57.173
Here is my man.

35:59.342 --> 36:00.468
How you feel?

36:01.386 --> 36:03.764
Come here. Very good.

36:03.847 --> 36:06.391
Gentlemen, my friend Eddie.

36:06.474 --> 36:07.726
- My brother.
- Hello.

36:07.809 --> 36:11.479
They are Freddy, Tony and Alex. Yes?
Yes.

36:11.562 --> 36:14.315
He is nervous.

36:14.399 --> 36:16.860
Because he never saw the light of the day.

36:16.943 --> 36:19.279
Or yes, but usually before bed.

36:20.613 --> 36:22.240
Hey, he's my brother,

36:22.323 --> 36:25.160
but that does not mean that
you can not be hard on him.

36:25.243 --> 36:26.702
Do not be soft.

36:26.787 --> 36:27.954
Make it work.

37:00.445 --> 37:01.487
Agree.

37:02.447 --> 37:05.075
Looks good. You're good? Yes.

37:05.158 --> 37:06.659
- What is this?
- What?

37:06.743 --> 37:08.620
It's sweat. I've never seen it before.

37:08.703 --> 37:09.830
You've learned something.

37:09.913 --> 37:11.915
He does not know how to
use the rake or anything.

37:11.998 --> 37:13.541
I used another kind of rake.

37:13.624 --> 37:14.750
This is worse.

37:14.834 --> 37:17.962
If you cut your lawn better than you play
bowling. It's okay. Giving me a call.

37:18.046 --> 37:19.297
- All right.
- Giving me a call.

37:24.719 --> 37:25.720
That's my man.

37:26.387 --> 37:28.348
- He's my man.
- Back.

37:29.765 --> 37:32.435
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.

37:33.561 --> 37:35.646
This is great.
Hey, I'll introduce you to Eddie.

37:36.940 --> 37:39.234
Maybe they recognize it.
He has not come for a long time.

37:40.651 --> 37:42.988
The important thing is that he returned.

37:43.071 --> 37:44.697
- Yes.
- Glad to be back.

38:03.216 --> 38:04.509
Are you coming to work?

38:08.889 --> 38:09.973
Yes, I'm sorry.

38:11.391 --> 38:13.059
I'm sorry, lunch killed me.

38:16.980 --> 38:18.148
You can!

38:18.982 --> 38:20.901
- Ends.
- You must throw again.

38:20.984 --> 38:22.818
- Again?
- Yes!

38:24.863 --> 38:27.073
You will see.

38:27.657 --> 38:29.117
- Well done.
- You're up!

38:31.202 --> 38:33.163
- Good shot.
- Thank you.

38:34.831 --> 38:36.624
Did you want to use that one?
Yes.

38:36.708 --> 38:38.585
- Use it.
- Use the girls' ball.

38:38.668 --> 38:39.878
My thumb got stuck.

38:42.923 --> 38:44.257
Well, I'm going to pitch.

38:44.340 --> 38:46.509
That hurt.

38:46.592 --> 38:47.593
How good.

38:48.553 --> 38:51.222
He cared about you.
That's what's important.

38:51.306 --> 38:53.308
- Right.
- Just like my dad.

38:53.391 --> 38:55.851
Chips cared... whatever happens,

38:55.936 --> 38:58.563
he loved my brother and
me more than anyone.

39:01.691 --> 39:04.986
<i>There may be success at
the end of this tunnel.</i>

39:05.070 --> 39:08.323
<i>But, for me, it was an
incredible feeling.</i>

39:08.406 --> 39:10.992
You feel like a child again. So.

39:11.076 --> 39:14.870
Not even as a child.
Sometimes you feel like a baby.

39:14.955 --> 39:18.291
As if someone else had to
take care of the situation.

39:19.417 --> 39:21.127
"I can not do anything. What I do?".

39:21.211 --> 39:24.047
You could go to work and make money.

39:24.130 --> 39:26.174
But people expect things from you.

39:26.841 --> 39:29.010
They want you to do other things. And me...

39:29.928 --> 39:31.888
I was being childish.

39:31.972 --> 39:33.723
- Hello.
- Hello.

39:33.806 --> 39:35.558
I think I'm going home.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.685
I want to see Jude
before she falls asleep.

39:37.768 --> 39:39.770
Show me what to do with this order.

39:39.854 --> 39:40.981
I want to do it right.

39:41.064 --> 39:43.483
You enter in quickbooks.

39:43.566 --> 39:46.694
You organize them, and we can
process them and send the invoices.

39:46.777 --> 39:48.613
So, is this no longer useful?

39:48.696 --> 39:50.615
- Yes, that is no longer used.
- All right.

39:50.698 --> 39:51.699
Great.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.910
I'm proud. Well done.

39:53.993 --> 39:57.455
- Thank you. It's important to me.
- This helps us a lot.

39:58.539 --> 40:01.167
When you're done with that,
you can throw it away.

40:01.250 --> 40:02.710
- Great. I love.
- All right.

40:03.378 --> 40:04.754
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:05.671 --> 40:07.840
- Greetings to all of you.
- I will do it.

40:18.268 --> 40:19.269
Hi.

40:19.352 --> 40:21.312
- How are you?
- What happened, Victor?

40:22.063 --> 40:23.523
Are you going to pay today?

40:23.606 --> 40:25.066
I'm going to pay now!

40:25.150 --> 40:27.568
- Friend!
- That's for you, my friend.

40:27.652 --> 40:29.320
- Agree.
- Thank you, Victor.

40:29.404 --> 40:30.989
- The last.
- Thank you, Victor.

40:31.072 --> 40:33.324
- My name is Eddie.
- Eddie...

40:33.408 --> 40:35.285
- It's okay. Thank you.
- All right, Eddie.

40:35.368 --> 40:37.162
- Thanks friend.
- All right.

40:37.245 --> 40:38.704
- All in order.
- Very good.

40:38.788 --> 40:41.416
- Bye. Thank you.
- Very good.

40:41.499 --> 40:44.710
- Goodbye friend.
- Bye. I love you.

40:44.794 --> 40:47.547
- And I to you. Bye.
- All right. Bye.

40:47.630 --> 40:48.798
<i>- That's why.
- Why?</i>

40:48.881 --> 40:51.301
Because in Mexico there
are no large tortillas.

40:51.384 --> 40:53.136
There are only small tortillas.

40:53.219 --> 40:55.055
How do you make a burrito
with the big ones?

40:55.138 --> 40:56.931
- But...
- I mean, little...

40:57.015 --> 40:58.641
They can make large tortillas.

40:58.724 --> 41:01.394
It's not that they do not have
the technology to do them.

41:01.477 --> 41:03.604
You are right.

41:03.688 --> 41:07.317
In Mexico there are only small tortillas.
You are good.

41:08.068 --> 41:10.153
We always pretend it's time.

41:10.236 --> 41:12.363
- It's time.
- It's always beer time.

41:13.323 --> 41:15.003
I have to go. Tomorrow, I'll get up early.

41:15.027 --> 41:16.826
- What?
- I have to go.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.536
He has to work in the nursery.

41:18.619 --> 41:20.830
- Yes, art. See you, pat.
- Bye, James.

41:20.913 --> 41:22.332
- Eddie.
- Goodbye friend.

41:22.415 --> 41:26.836
I do not like to think that i
am addicted to the game, but...

41:26.919 --> 41:31.257
I keep betting and losing, so...

41:31.341 --> 41:34.302
I'm not an idiot. True?

41:34.385 --> 41:39.390
And the feeling of having nothing, being
a loser and being without a penny.

41:39.474 --> 41:41.059
You get into the body and...

41:41.976 --> 41:44.145
That's the feeling I chase.

41:44.229 --> 41:45.855
I do not want to pursue her anymore.

41:46.897 --> 41:48.691
Because it's a horrible feeling.

41:49.442 --> 41:56.282
And I'm here to stop chasing that
shit and straightening the course.

41:56.574 --> 41:58.451
- My favorite part.
- Thank you.

41:58.534 --> 42:00.161
- You earned it.
- Thank you.

42:00.245 --> 42:02.247
I'm proud of you. Well done.

42:02.330 --> 42:04.165
- I gave you some more.
- What is this?

42:04.249 --> 42:06.959
I give the boys an
extra every week.

42:07.042 --> 42:09.212
Listen, have fun on the weekend.

42:09.295 --> 42:11.130
- Treat yourself.
- Thank you. I will do it.

42:11.214 --> 42:12.214
See you Monday.

42:14.384 --> 42:15.968
- Good friend.
- Very good.

42:17.052 --> 42:18.053
Do not behave yourself.

42:18.971 --> 42:21.599
- I have $ 200. I am rich!
- Yes!

42:22.350 --> 42:23.601
Watch out.

42:24.727 --> 42:26.437
- Hello.
- Hello.

42:37.407 --> 42:38.699
You look great.

42:39.909 --> 42:41.702
- They're for you.
- You look great.

42:41.786 --> 42:42.787
Thank you.

42:45.039 --> 42:46.207
Are you ready? Yes.

42:46.291 --> 42:50.586
You know? I like the business
more than I thought.

42:50.670 --> 42:53.214
I thought I would not like that part,

42:53.298 --> 42:54.590
but I like it.

42:54.674 --> 43:00.054
It is structured so that Ron owns
all of the capital of the company.

43:00.138 --> 43:02.932
But by contract, half is mine.

43:03.015 --> 43:07.478
His dream, and it begins to be
mine too, is that we both own 50%.

43:07.562 --> 43:11.649
I'm going to work and
save to buy a part.

43:11.732 --> 43:14.152
Some extra work.

43:14.235 --> 43:17.238
We will count them as
capital up to 50%.

43:17.321 --> 43:21.117
Then we'll run it together and
we can do whatever we want.

43:21.201 --> 43:23.661
The business is doing very well, in fact.

43:23.744 --> 43:25.455
But I think it could improve.

43:25.538 --> 43:27.373
They could inherit our children and...

43:27.457 --> 43:29.625
They want dessert?

43:31.669 --> 43:34.422
I'll leave you some menus.

43:34.505 --> 43:35.665
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

43:35.689 --> 43:36.689
Thank you.

43:37.342 --> 43:38.926
What do you think? Do you want dessert?

43:39.009 --> 43:40.595
- Do not.
- Do not.

43:40.678 --> 43:44.182
- Do you like this place?
- Is not my style.

43:44.265 --> 43:45.933
Mine neither.

43:46.016 --> 43:47.893
I just came to impress you.

43:47.977 --> 43:49.061
Really? Yes.

43:49.144 --> 43:50.289
I did not know, I did not know it.
Yes.

43:50.313 --> 43:51.481
- You know what?
- What?

43:51.564 --> 43:53.191
I'll take you to a place I like.

43:53.858 --> 43:55.318
Very good. Yes.

43:55.401 --> 43:56.444
It will be fun.

43:56.527 --> 43:58.696
- Eva, I do not want to do this.
- If you want.

43:58.779 --> 44:00.865
- Really, I do not want to.
- You are going to do it.

44:00.948 --> 44:02.200
- Very good.
- Not seriously.

44:02.283 --> 44:03.868
- You have to dance!
- Very good!

44:03.951 --> 44:05.870
All right. I'll try... dance.

44:05.953 --> 44:07.955
- Yes?
- All right. Let's dance.

44:08.038 --> 44:09.832
- Come on!
- Very good!

44:09.915 --> 44:11.209
One two three. So?

44:11.292 --> 44:12.377
- One two three.
- Yes.

44:12.460 --> 44:14.545
- One two three. Very good.
- Yes.

44:14.629 --> 44:16.922
- You dance very sexi.
- You say that to say.

44:17.006 --> 44:19.425
- Is not true.
- I know. Are you ready?

44:57.797 --> 44:59.590
- You go.
- Do not.

44:59.674 --> 45:01.258
- Only you.
- Come on.

45:01.342 --> 45:02.343
You go.

45:27.660 --> 45:29.161
I have to go.

45:29.244 --> 45:30.330
Invite me in.

45:32.225 --> 45:33.225
You can not.

45:33.249 --> 45:34.834
- I will not make noise.
- Do not.

45:34.917 --> 45:35.835
Are you crazy?

45:35.918 --> 45:38.838
"Please, let me in."
My mom and my daughter are inside.

45:38.921 --> 45:41.716
I know, but I will be so silent
that they will not notice.

45:41.799 --> 45:43.008
I'll leave right away.

45:43.092 --> 45:44.552
I'll come in and leave very quickly.

45:44.635 --> 45:46.220
- Please.
- Oh, my god. Do not.

45:46.303 --> 45:47.304
Do not ruin it.

45:47.388 --> 45:48.431
- Do not.
- Is soon.

45:48.514 --> 45:49.557
- I know.
- Yes?

45:49.640 --> 45:50.975
- I have to go.
- Wait.

46:21.756 --> 46:24.675
Hi. What is wrong with this image?

46:26.177 --> 46:28.471
- I don't know.
- This is in my hand, not in yours.

46:28.971 --> 46:31.599
- I did not have the gas.
- I know. That's why I came.

46:31.682 --> 46:34.644
That's why I spent an hour in western.
To bring you gas.

46:34.727 --> 46:37.605
- Is that a joke, shit?
- Do not.

46:37.688 --> 46:38.939
Are you blaming me?

46:39.023 --> 46:41.859
- The lawn mower has gas.
- It's not my job!

46:41.942 --> 46:43.611
I have to go to five more jobs.

46:43.694 --> 46:46.656
Julio was at school
with a broken mower.

46:46.739 --> 46:48.949
And the lawn in half!
It looked like an alien work!

46:49.033 --> 46:51.827
Do not look at me like that.
It's your fault.

46:51.911 --> 46:54.246
- Put the fumes down.
- I am sorry. Hears.

46:54.329 --> 46:56.999
Cut me the salary.
I'm sorry I was wrong!

46:57.082 --> 46:58.083
- Yes?
- Thank you.

46:58.167 --> 47:00.628
I thought I had done everything.
I guess it was not like that.

47:00.711 --> 47:03.673
I will come early and ask
as many questions as I can.

47:03.756 --> 47:05.132
- Thank you.
- I will strive.

47:05.215 --> 47:07.051
Thank you. I'm fucking with you.

47:08.594 --> 47:10.471
I'm fucking with you.

47:11.138 --> 47:12.347
I'm not mad at you.

47:15.017 --> 47:18.145
Do you see the smile? I'm kidding.

47:18.228 --> 47:20.314
This is what is happening.

47:20.397 --> 47:21.441
Get the gas.

47:21.524 --> 47:24.276
Freddy! You forgot the gas.
I brought her!

47:25.027 --> 47:27.488
- Great.
- Very funny.

47:28.489 --> 47:29.490
You smell a little.

47:29.574 --> 47:32.702
- You're an idiot.
- I know.

47:35.663 --> 47:37.915
- That goes in...
- I know where it goes!

47:40.417 --> 47:41.919
- Jude, you can.
- Your turn.

47:42.002 --> 47:43.588
- You can do it!
- Throw them.

47:43.671 --> 47:44.880
Come on, Jude!

47:44.964 --> 47:47.341
I like this.
I have a good feeling.

47:47.424 --> 47:48.468
Very good!

47:48.551 --> 47:51.053
- It diverts well! Is going to give it!
- He's drifting.

47:52.638 --> 47:54.098
Yes!

47:54.181 --> 47:57.142
All right, Ron!

47:57.226 --> 47:59.479
Do not! Ron!

47:59.562 --> 48:00.688
You ruined it!

48:01.689 --> 48:03.273
Give me time.

48:03.357 --> 48:04.441
Do not!

48:04.525 --> 48:06.902
- I have trouble throwing with the arm!
- Do not!

48:10.322 --> 48:11.574
All right, uncle Eddie.

48:12.492 --> 48:14.702
Are you ready? Yes.

48:14.785 --> 48:16.787
I think so. I see.

48:16.871 --> 48:19.331
Go where you want to begin.

48:28.841 --> 48:31.260
- It's okay.
- I mean...

48:31.343 --> 48:33.220
- Amazing.
- You gave it all.

48:33.303 --> 48:36.849
You've been in a very good mood.

48:36.932 --> 48:39.393
You're doing a great job.
The team adores you.

48:39.476 --> 48:41.186
Yes, they are good guys.

48:41.270 --> 48:42.354
- Yes.
- Good guys.

48:42.437 --> 48:44.649
It's not as bad as I thought.

48:44.732 --> 48:47.109
You see? You just had to try it.

48:47.192 --> 48:48.528
Working is not difficult.

48:48.611 --> 48:50.070
- Not bad.
- It's fun.

48:50.154 --> 48:51.530
You can do it. It's good.

48:51.614 --> 48:53.115
Do I want to work every day?

48:53.198 --> 48:54.324
- Do not.
- Do not.

48:54.408 --> 48:56.911
- I understand.
- I'm glad when the day is over?

48:56.994 --> 48:58.329
Yes. Yes.

48:58.954 --> 49:00.289
I like to collect my salary?

49:00.372 --> 49:01.790
Yes. Yes.

49:02.249 --> 49:04.168
It's partly the girl you date.

49:04.251 --> 49:07.171
It shows that you like it.

49:07.254 --> 49:09.590
It has you spellbound.

49:09.674 --> 49:11.926
Ron, it's fabulous.

49:13.052 --> 49:14.804
Has it all. Yes.

49:14.887 --> 49:17.264
Is incredible.

49:18.098 --> 49:20.851
I had never felt this way before.

49:21.852 --> 49:23.187
She's smart and fabulous.

49:23.270 --> 49:25.230
Let's go slow.
We are getting acquainted.

49:25.314 --> 49:26.982
I imagine everything with her.

49:27.816 --> 49:29.777
I imagine everything. Yes.

49:29.860 --> 49:32.863
- I've never felt it. It is different.
- Great. Yes.

49:32.947 --> 49:34.907
Great to hear. Noticeable...

49:34.990 --> 49:37.367
It helped you recover.

49:37.451 --> 49:39.912
- Definitely.
- But it has happened before.

49:39.995 --> 49:42.582
Something raises the mood,

49:43.498 --> 49:46.501
but it does not work out as you would like.
Suddenly you're...

49:46.586 --> 49:48.253
But this time it's different.

49:49.171 --> 49:50.923
- Agree.
- That's what I'm telling you.

49:51.006 --> 49:54.259
I'm just saying that
you've said it before,

49:54.343 --> 49:56.929
and it could be... maybe it's different.

49:57.888 --> 50:00.015
Eddie, you got that look and...

50:00.099 --> 50:02.685
You're giving me a fucking lecture.
Shut up.

50:02.768 --> 50:04.019
Shut up.

50:05.020 --> 50:06.020
For.

50:06.856 --> 50:07.857
Stop it, shit.

50:07.940 --> 50:09.108
Good.

50:09.191 --> 50:13.279
I just want to make sure you're
on the right track. That is all.

50:13.362 --> 50:16.532
And if it's different with her, I'm glad.

50:16.616 --> 50:18.158
And it probably is.

50:18.242 --> 50:20.870
Maybe you should introduce us.

50:20.953 --> 50:22.788
That would be great. Yes.

50:22.872 --> 50:24.331
- Yes?
- Great.

50:24.414 --> 50:25.833
- Would you like it?
- Clear.

50:25.916 --> 50:28.711
I don't know. Anything. A dinner.

50:28.794 --> 50:31.171
Why do not you invite her to dinner?
Could be.

50:31.255 --> 50:32.715
We will have wine and good food.

50:32.798 --> 50:34.634
We could meet her. I would love to.

50:34.717 --> 50:36.010
Let's dine together.

50:36.093 --> 50:37.344
We will go to your house.

50:37.427 --> 50:38.971
That's what I say. Great.

50:39.054 --> 50:40.514
Its what I say.

50:40.597 --> 50:42.516
I'm glad you said it.

50:42.599 --> 50:44.685
Great. Can we stop talking about this?

50:44.769 --> 50:46.061
- It is done. Fact!
- Done!

50:47.062 --> 50:49.189
I should have hit that half-dead.

50:49.273 --> 50:51.776
You are so bad that you failed.

50:51.859 --> 50:54.111
- I'm good.
- Is not true.

50:57.197 --> 50:58.699
It's nothing serious.

50:58.783 --> 51:00.868
- It's just fun.
- Very good.

51:00.951 --> 51:02.787
- That's.
- I'm going to have fun.

51:02.870 --> 51:07.166
Wait, I have to park well so you
do not laugh too much at me.

51:07.249 --> 51:08.250
Agree.

51:08.333 --> 51:10.386
All right. This is
what is going to happen.

51:10.398 --> 51:11.086
Agree.

51:12.337 --> 51:13.673
We'll go to the gate.

51:13.756 --> 51:15.632
He will make fun of how I parked.

51:15.716 --> 51:17.634
Then he will make fun of my clothes.

51:17.718 --> 51:19.428
The joke will not be funny.

51:19.511 --> 51:23.140
Then he will look at you, he
will have a revelation and say,

51:23.223 --> 51:25.184
"you look adorable".

51:25.267 --> 51:26.811
And you have to say, "thank you."

51:26.894 --> 51:29.021
Then he will exaggerate and say,

51:29.104 --> 51:31.106
welcome to the Taj Mahal.

51:31.691 --> 51:33.943
Eddie, can you get farther
away from the sidewalk?

51:34.026 --> 51:35.027
Very good.

51:35.110 --> 51:36.862
Ron, she's Eva.

51:36.946 --> 51:37.947
- My brother.
- Hello.

51:38.030 --> 51:39.406
Eva, delighted. Welcome.

51:40.199 --> 51:42.326
Did you buy it at ugly cost?

51:42.409 --> 51:43.786
Great. Fantastic. Yes.

51:43.869 --> 51:44.912
You look spectacular.

51:44.995 --> 51:46.997
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

51:47.081 --> 51:49.249
Welcome to the Garrett mansion.

51:51.711 --> 51:53.462
He has a sense of humor. How good.

51:53.545 --> 51:54.964
- Yes.
- Welcome. Come in.

51:55.672 --> 51:59.051
- Welcome to my humble abode.
- Very good.

51:59.134 --> 52:00.845
Why are you trotting like that, Ron?

52:00.928 --> 52:02.429
- I'm excited.
- Dresses?

52:02.512 --> 52:03.513
It is exciting!

52:03.597 --> 52:05.725
- For us too.
- I am glad.

52:05.808 --> 52:08.560
- Our dad...
- I bet a lot.

52:08.643 --> 52:11.396
He played a lot of
cards and lost a lot.

52:11.480 --> 52:13.273
And while playing with friends,

52:13.357 --> 52:16.026
papa always shouted, "chips!"

52:16.110 --> 52:19.739
Until finally they said:
"Hey, chips, let's go to the casino."

52:19.822 --> 52:21.573
He accepted, and so he got chips.

52:21.656 --> 52:23.242
- Yes.
- Maybe I'm lucky.

52:23.325 --> 52:24.701
Yes? Yes.

52:24.785 --> 52:27.913
I do not think I'm such a good mother.

52:27.997 --> 52:30.207
- Is incredible.
- She's an amazing mom.

52:30.290 --> 52:30.977
Of course.

52:30.989 --> 52:33.085
Insurance. It is difficult
to be a single mother.

52:33.168 --> 52:34.294
Thank you. Yes.

52:34.378 --> 52:37.464
But he sure loves Eddie.
They sure get along.

52:37.547 --> 52:38.590
Good...

52:40.968 --> 52:43.971
- Ahead. I do not care.
- You still do not know him.

52:44.054 --> 52:46.174
- You have not met her?
- They do not know each other?

52:46.223 --> 52:47.767
- Agree.
- All right.

52:47.850 --> 52:49.894
I don't know.
Are they going slowly?

52:49.977 --> 52:52.646
I think we have to overcome many filters.

52:52.729 --> 52:54.398
When you have kids, so...

52:54.481 --> 52:56.191
- I agree.
- Yes, definitely.

52:56.275 --> 52:57.818
If this is genuine,

52:57.902 --> 53:00.863
Eddie will have time to
get along with Ella,

53:00.946 --> 53:04.449
but I've never introduced her to my
boyfriends or the people I date.

53:04.533 --> 53:06.911
- Very smart.
- We think that's a good idea,

53:06.994 --> 53:09.830
- but I wish I knew her soon.
- You would be the first.

53:09.914 --> 53:11.206
You're a smart woman.

53:11.290 --> 53:12.875
I will be glad to meet you.

53:12.958 --> 53:15.544
I do not introduce Jude
to the men I go out with.

53:16.586 --> 53:17.922
- Very good.
- It is a ruler.

53:18.005 --> 53:19.799
I only know what is strictly necessary.

53:20.549 --> 53:23.468
Those are tomatoes.
Look, there's a mature one.

53:23.552 --> 53:24.594
Really? Yes.

53:24.678 --> 53:27.389
- Is incredible.
- So is. I like very much.

53:27.473 --> 53:29.475
Do not ruin it. I love.

53:29.558 --> 53:32.561
- I do not mean to.
- I already know it.

53:32.644 --> 53:34.521
I'm just saying I like it. Yes.

53:34.605 --> 53:37.441
- Me too. It's great.
- A lot. Yes.

53:37.524 --> 53:38.964
- It's going to be good.
- All right.

53:38.988 --> 53:41.528
He was not scared of you.

53:41.611 --> 53:44.781
Look. I'm not a mafioso.

53:45.699 --> 53:47.492
Thanks for coming.

53:49.494 --> 53:50.579
I loved it.

53:50.662 --> 53:52.539
- Really?
- Yeah. I had a great time.

53:52.622 --> 53:56.376
All right. I also.
I do not usually have fun

53:56.460 --> 53:58.628
with my brother.

53:58.712 --> 54:00.714
- But it was great.
- I know.

54:00.797 --> 54:02.007
Thank you.

54:12.226 --> 54:13.226
Very good.

54:13.853 --> 54:16.230
This is the situation.

54:16.313 --> 54:17.314
Yes?

54:19.149 --> 54:23.112
My mom and Emma are watching a movie.

54:24.029 --> 54:26.531
And will return in an hour.

54:27.657 --> 54:29.409
Maybe we can...

54:33.038 --> 54:34.039
Wait.

54:35.165 --> 54:36.500
Maybe we can...

55:15.789 --> 55:17.582
I do not know where I'm going.

55:17.666 --> 55:19.001
- Here.
- Very good.

55:58.832 --> 55:59.833
Good.

56:05.672 --> 56:06.673
Hi.

56:06.756 --> 56:11.178
<i>Has a collect call from the
convict's cook county prison...</i>

56:11.261 --> 56:12.346
<i>Michael.</i>

56:12.429 --> 56:15.682
<i>If you want to accept
the charges, check one.</i>

56:15.765 --> 56:17.351
<i>If you want to reject...</i>

56:27.319 --> 56:29.154
<i>Hi, Eddie. I have good news.</i>

56:29.237 --> 56:30.322
What happened?

56:30.405 --> 56:32.658
<i>I will be released soon.</i>

56:34.284 --> 56:35.284
When?

56:35.327 --> 56:37.287
<i>In eight days.</i>

56:40.916 --> 56:41.916
What?

56:42.417 --> 56:46.421
<i>Yes, administrative things, but
they let me out of here. So...</i>

56:47.381 --> 56:49.132
<i>I hope everything is fine there.</i>

56:49.216 --> 56:54.554
Yes cool. That's...
Are good news.

56:54.638 --> 56:57.016
<i>And neglect, our deal is still standing.</i>

56:57.099 --> 56:58.100
<i>I'll give you your share.</i>

56:58.183 --> 57:00.852
Yes, I certainly would. Great. This is...

57:01.770 --> 57:03.147
What a good day.

57:03.230 --> 57:07.276
I wanted to get rid of
it, so it's perfect.

57:07.359 --> 57:10.029
<i>Very good. See you next Monday.</i>

57:10.112 --> 57:11.363
Yes.

57:11.446 --> 57:12.489
<i>Are you okay, Eddie?</i>

57:13.823 --> 57:17.369
I? Yes, I'm excited.

57:17.452 --> 57:18.453
<i>Agree.</i>

57:20.080 --> 57:21.081
Very good.

57:22.457 --> 57:23.792
Beware.

57:36.930 --> 57:38.432
- Hello friend.
- Eddie.

57:38.515 --> 57:40.600
What's up?
You should be in ravenswood.

57:40.684 --> 57:42.144
- You got a minute?
- Five.

57:42.227 --> 57:44.313
- I get it.
- You're at my desk.

57:44.396 --> 57:46.398
I know. I do not want to be here. May l...?

57:46.481 --> 57:48.275
I do not want you here either.

57:48.358 --> 57:50.902
- What do you do?
- Ron, I...

57:50.985 --> 57:54.031
You must know that this is
the last thing I want to do.

57:54.948 --> 57:58.827
There was an unexpected
and unfortunate event...

57:58.910 --> 58:02.831
Yes, something unexpected and unfortunate:
A cutter that is not cutting.

58:02.914 --> 58:05.959
- I'm missing a worker.
- Ron, I need you to listen to me.

58:06.043 --> 58:07.086
What are you doing here?

58:07.169 --> 58:08.503
Listen to me.

58:10.214 --> 58:11.715
- The deal we made...
- Yes?

58:12.466 --> 58:13.967
It is coming out very well.

58:14.051 --> 58:15.469
Until now.

58:15.552 --> 58:16.595
But it was...

58:16.678 --> 58:19.223
I kept everything I promised.
Is not true?

58:19.306 --> 58:21.141
Is not it true that I changed?
Yes.

58:21.225 --> 58:22.351
Did you see a change?

58:22.434 --> 58:24.103
- Eddie, come on...
- Listen to me!

58:24.186 --> 58:26.105
Do not put that face. Listen to me!

58:26.188 --> 58:28.565
I'll pay for it.
Only it will take longer.

58:28.648 --> 58:31.026
- The same conditions.
- At six weeks?

58:31.110 --> 58:35.155
Are you asking me to pay you
what we agreed for six months?

58:35.239 --> 58:36.948
- Are you kidding?
- Do not!

58:37.031 --> 58:40.202
I do not care if you
give me back quintuple.

58:40.285 --> 58:42.788
- You think I want to do it?
- Do not! Do you think I do.

58:42.871 --> 58:44.414
Do you know how I feel ashamed?

58:44.498 --> 58:46.875
- Listen to me.
- Do you know how much I hate this?

58:46.958 --> 58:48.460
- Yes. Eddie...
- Please!

58:48.543 --> 58:49.836
- Eddie...
- Say yes!

58:51.796 --> 58:53.298
- Say yes, Ron.
- I'm screwed up.

58:54.174 --> 58:55.509
Say yes, Ron.

58:57.136 --> 58:58.220
Eddie...

58:59.513 --> 59:00.639
Do not.

59:01.348 --> 59:02.349
The answer is no.

59:03.057 --> 59:04.934
I am sorry. I will not give you money.

59:05.018 --> 59:07.396
That's not the deal. It
does not work like that.

59:15.987 --> 59:20.200
Every year hundreds of people
disappear in national parks.

59:20.284 --> 59:23.245
You could take your car to the
rocky mountains national park.

59:23.328 --> 59:26.623
It is not far away. You leave
it open with a lit cigarette,

59:26.706 --> 59:28.542
- and you disappear.
- I like it.

59:28.625 --> 59:30.043
I'll pick you up.

59:30.127 --> 59:31.711
You go to Canada and you do whatever.

59:31.795 --> 59:34.047
And then? What do I do the rest of my life?

59:34.131 --> 59:35.465
It depends on you.

59:35.549 --> 59:36.758
It is an option. Yes.

59:36.841 --> 59:37.884
Go to Guatemala.

59:37.967 --> 59:40.220
- What ties you here?
- All right. Stop.

59:40.304 --> 59:42.806
- Short the grass.
- Stop.

59:42.889 --> 59:44.474
I do not want to fake my own death.

59:44.558 --> 59:47.936
I'm just asking for ways
to raise this money.

59:48.019 --> 59:50.647
A good friend of mine made
$ 10,000 in two hours.

59:50.730 --> 59:52.816
- How?
- In las Vegas. He has abs.

59:52.899 --> 59:55.319
- If we paint abs...
- Arthur, shut up.

59:55.402 --> 59:56.778
I'm serious.

59:56.861 --> 59:58.780
You have money.
We bought a package.

59:58.863 --> 01:00:01.825
We fill it with talc and things
like that and we sell it.

01:00:01.908 --> 01:00:04.228
We are not going to dedicate
ourselves to selling cocaine.

01:00:04.286 --> 01:00:05.954
- Do you want to live or die?
- I...

01:00:06.037 --> 01:00:07.622
What's wrong with selling Coca?

01:00:08.415 --> 01:00:09.583
Nothing.

01:00:09.666 --> 01:00:12.419
You sell them to executives from
the Chicago stock exchange.

01:00:12.502 --> 01:00:14.213
Yes. Those guys are expendable.

01:00:14.296 --> 01:00:16.173
Do not push it!

01:00:16.256 --> 01:00:19.384
We are not going to sell Coca. Stop!

01:00:19.468 --> 01:00:21.595
I need a realistic option.

01:00:21.678 --> 01:00:23.347
- Come on the offensive.
- Agree.

01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:25.974
He bursts into his house. Come on.

01:00:26.057 --> 01:00:28.393
- When he arrives at night.
- Good idea.

01:00:28.477 --> 01:00:30.937
- It's the worst idea.
- Three rabbits in a row.

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:34.316
- Dead. With blood on his face.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

01:00:34.399 --> 01:00:36.568
Point out that you are a
worshiper of the devil.

01:00:36.651 --> 01:00:40.071
Laugh, but it's the
best idea I've heard.

01:00:40.154 --> 01:00:43.325
- The best that has come to us.
- If that's the best...

01:00:43.408 --> 01:00:46.370
Make an application.
Those guys make a lot of money.

01:00:48.288 --> 01:00:50.790
- An app?
- The business is saturated.

01:00:50.874 --> 01:00:52.584
- What?
- The business is saturated.

01:00:53.502 --> 01:00:54.836
What does that mean?

01:00:54.919 --> 01:00:56.963
Too many people are making apps.

01:00:57.046 --> 01:00:58.340
There are too many applications.

01:00:59.258 --> 01:01:01.050
Make a good one.

01:01:01.134 --> 01:01:03.595
Yes? How?

01:01:03.678 --> 01:01:05.398
He does not know anything about technology.

01:01:05.422 --> 01:01:07.140
- Cut the grass.
- It was an idea.

01:01:07.224 --> 01:01:08.892
Make an application for that.

01:01:09.809 --> 01:01:11.728
- What a good idea.
- Not bad.

01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:13.230
- I like it.
- It is not good.

01:01:24.199 --> 01:01:25.659
<i>- I'm screwed up!
- Good...</i>

01:01:25.742 --> 01:01:27.994
- I hear you.
- I'm sorry, but I'm fucked.

01:01:28.077 --> 01:01:29.078
Lower your voice.

01:01:29.162 --> 01:01:30.497
- I hear you.
- Gene.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.081
- Listen to me.
- I hear you.

01:01:32.165 --> 01:01:33.166
- Hears!
- I hear you.

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:35.460
- I'm scared.
- I hear you, but lower your voice.

01:01:35.544 --> 01:01:37.003
You must lower your voice, okay?

01:01:37.086 --> 01:01:38.672
I have neighbors and a son.

01:01:38.755 --> 01:01:40.173
You must lower your voice.

01:01:40.257 --> 01:01:42.008
- And you must listen to me.
- I hear you.

01:01:42.091 --> 01:01:44.469
- I did everything you said.
- Take it easy.

01:01:44.553 --> 01:01:45.887
I'm calm.

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:47.221
I'm calm? Yes.

01:01:47.306 --> 01:01:48.598
- Just relax.
- Very good.

01:01:48.682 --> 01:01:50.350
I did everything you said.

01:01:50.434 --> 01:01:52.143
I did everything my brother said.

01:01:52.226 --> 01:01:54.271
- I went to meetings.
- Damn it, Eddie.

01:01:54.354 --> 01:01:56.856
But I've never been so fucked up before.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.526
And I need a plan b now.

01:01:59.609 --> 01:02:04.656
Now, gene. I have no idea
and I am very scared.

01:02:04.739 --> 01:02:06.199
Very good. Listen out.

01:02:06.283 --> 01:02:10.579
Whatever the problem, it
will not get worse tonight.

01:02:10.662 --> 01:02:12.914
It's 2:30 A.M. m. It will
not get any worse now.

01:02:12.997 --> 01:02:14.874
I need something already.

01:02:14.958 --> 01:02:17.043
Now I can not give you anything.

01:02:17.126 --> 01:02:21.089
I can not. I'll give it to you
tomorrow at the meeting. I promise.

01:02:21.172 --> 01:02:23.132
- The fucking meeting.
- Fuck that.

01:02:23.216 --> 01:02:24.593
No, fuck it. Look at me.

01:02:24.676 --> 01:02:26.970
Fuck the meeting.
Call me at 7:00 A.M. m.

01:02:27.053 --> 01:02:29.306
- And we'll think about it.
- I'm calling you now.

01:02:29.389 --> 01:02:32.225
You can not call me now
because I have a son.

01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:34.143
I have neighbors.
I can not get you inside.

01:02:34.227 --> 01:02:35.269
- Good.
- Yes?

01:02:35.354 --> 01:02:36.813
I have recomposed my life.

01:02:36.896 --> 01:02:39.190
- I got it back.
- Agree.

01:02:39.273 --> 01:02:40.473
- Yes? Listen out.
- All right.

01:02:40.525 --> 01:02:41.568
- Listen out.
- All right.

01:02:41.651 --> 01:02:43.945
Wait until the meeting

01:02:44.029 --> 01:02:45.905
- and we fixed it.
- I'm sorry I came.

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:47.115
I'm fine.

01:02:49.368 --> 01:02:50.369
We are fine.

01:03:23.902 --> 01:03:25.111
Hi, Eddie.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.867
- Do not!
- Shit, Eddie!

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:32.744
- Do not!
- We gotta get you out, Eddie.

01:03:32.827 --> 01:03:33.870
We must expel you.

01:03:33.953 --> 01:03:34.954
- Two weeks.
- Do not!

01:03:35.038 --> 01:03:36.540
- Stay away for two weeks.
- Do not!

01:03:36.623 --> 01:03:38.207
- We gotta get you out, Eddie.
- Do not!

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:39.709
Go home. You're drunk.

01:03:39.793 --> 01:03:41.670
Eddie, get out of here.

01:03:41.753 --> 01:03:43.672
- Come back in two weeks!
- Do not!

01:03:43.755 --> 01:03:45.173
Yes? Get out of here.

01:03:45.256 --> 01:03:46.800
Get out of here. You're drunk.

01:03:46.883 --> 01:03:48.468
Go home. Eddie.

01:03:48.552 --> 01:03:50.344
Go home.

01:03:50.429 --> 01:03:52.180
- Fuck off.
- Long.

01:03:52.263 --> 01:03:53.473
Fuck off! Yes.

01:04:13.034 --> 01:04:14.494
What do you think? Eddie

01:04:15.579 --> 01:04:16.580
Eddie.

01:04:18.206 --> 01:04:19.373
Eddie, can you hear me?

01:04:21.626 --> 01:04:23.044
What was he talking about?

01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:26.380
To have dinner together.

01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:28.132
Yes.

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:30.510
- I would love to.
- With Emma?

01:04:30.594 --> 01:04:31.970
Yes.

01:04:32.053 --> 01:04:33.053
When?

01:04:34.347 --> 01:04:35.724
Weekend.

01:04:35.807 --> 01:04:36.891
East? Yes.

01:04:36.975 --> 01:04:38.267
When? What a night?

01:04:39.227 --> 01:04:40.228
On Sunday.

01:04:40.311 --> 01:04:42.647
All right. What time?

01:04:42.731 --> 01:04:44.941
- For dinner.
- Tell me to what time.

01:04:45.024 --> 01:04:46.109
- Hour.
- At 7:00?

01:04:46.192 --> 01:04:47.193
- At 7:00.
- Maybe.

01:04:47.276 --> 01:04:49.446
- Well, I'll be there at...
- You want?

01:04:49.529 --> 01:04:50.989
Yes, of course I want.

01:04:51.072 --> 01:04:52.866
- I'm dying to meet her.
- Very good.

01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:54.659
What good news.

01:04:54.743 --> 01:04:56.786
I'm excited too. Will be great.

01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:58.162
It seems perfect.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.500
- Very good.
- I'm impatient.

01:05:02.291 --> 01:05:03.918
It's good that you had that time.

01:05:04.002 --> 01:05:05.920
Yes, it was great. Yes.

01:05:06.004 --> 01:05:07.005
- Yes.
- Fabulous.

01:05:07.088 --> 01:05:08.131
Take care.

01:05:08.214 --> 01:05:09.716
- Nice to see you.
- Bye.

01:05:09.799 --> 01:05:11.175
- Beware.
- I'm glad to see you.

01:05:11.259 --> 01:05:12.260
Very good.

01:05:15.722 --> 01:05:16.973
Are you hungry?

01:05:18.517 --> 01:05:20.727
- Yes.
- Let's go from here.

01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:22.250
Yes.
We are going to eat something.

01:05:22.896 --> 01:05:23.897
Yes?

01:05:24.814 --> 01:05:28.485
I must say that I like to have a job.

01:05:28.568 --> 01:05:31.613
I like to go up in that company.

01:05:31.696 --> 01:05:33.072
I like having a girlfriend.

01:05:33.156 --> 01:05:35.408
I like to feel like an adult.

01:05:35.492 --> 01:05:37.243
And not as if he were a degenerate.

01:05:38.161 --> 01:05:40.539
I do not wanna bet.
I do not feel the need.

01:05:40.622 --> 01:05:41.915
I do not want to be...

01:05:42.832 --> 01:05:44.333
I do not want to be in that world.

01:05:44.417 --> 01:05:47.671
And even if I wanted to, I could not
because I can not go to my casino.

01:05:47.754 --> 01:05:49.130
I was forbidden to enter.

01:05:49.672 --> 01:05:53.510
I do not know how, but I have to earn
all that money before Monday and...

01:05:54.594 --> 01:05:56.054
I'm lost, gene.

01:06:02.852 --> 01:06:03.853
Agree.

01:06:05.146 --> 01:06:07.148
I'll tell you right now.

01:06:07.231 --> 01:06:10.193
The worst thing a godfather can tell you.

01:06:13.112 --> 01:06:16.032
There's a game I can get you into.

01:06:17.283 --> 01:06:19.786
It's my old game.
The stakes are very strong.

01:06:20.912 --> 01:06:23.372
You can make lots of money very fast.

01:06:24.373 --> 01:06:27.460
But you can also
lose much as fast.

01:06:27.544 --> 01:06:28.837
Yes?

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.254
I must tell you.

01:06:30.338 --> 01:06:33.717
Believe me that, from what you told me,

01:06:34.508 --> 01:06:38.096
if you lose, you will
have to leave the city.

01:06:38.179 --> 01:06:39.764
Do not... yes.

01:06:39.931 --> 01:06:41.808
Do not go through the exit box.

01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:43.184
Do not go to your house.

01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:44.894
- Very good.
- Go away.

01:06:47.731 --> 01:06:49.608
I guess I'm telling you...

01:06:51.943 --> 01:06:53.111
You know...

01:06:54.028 --> 01:06:56.615
If you want me to call, I will.

01:06:58.783 --> 01:07:00.368
Call. Yes.

01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:03.747
- I do not see what other option...
- I do not want to, but call.

01:07:04.706 --> 01:07:05.706
Yes.

01:07:28.396 --> 01:07:30.356
It looks like a scary picture.

01:07:30.439 --> 01:07:31.565
Where we are?

01:07:32.191 --> 01:07:35.569
In the residential area.
We left the city.

01:07:35.654 --> 01:07:37.030
This is very scary.

01:07:37.113 --> 01:07:39.157
When we enter,

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.368
you will be my collector, my muscle.

01:07:42.451 --> 01:07:44.120
- Yes.
- It is important.

01:07:44.203 --> 01:07:46.164
That you always stay to my right.

01:07:46.247 --> 01:07:48.374
And hold the bag.

01:07:48.457 --> 01:07:50.543
When I go get money, you give it to me.

01:07:50.627 --> 01:07:52.295
It must flow very well.

01:07:52.378 --> 01:07:54.047
Many guys will have one.

01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:57.216
It is important that it seems
that we have done it before.

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.780
- Very good. Yes.
- Do you understand?

01:07:59.552 --> 01:08:02.138
We look like the men in black.

01:08:02.221 --> 01:08:04.849
Now I have doubts.
I do not want to be a man in black.

01:08:04.933 --> 01:08:07.226
We dressed smart.
We know what we do.

01:08:07.310 --> 01:08:08.812
Do not say that in there.

01:08:10.354 --> 01:08:11.856
I do not want them to think about it.

01:08:16.444 --> 01:08:19.154
Tomorrow at 7:00 I have a dinner.

01:08:19.238 --> 01:08:21.448
We have 24 hours to earn that money.

01:08:22.367 --> 01:08:29.040
Grand appliances and TV.

01:08:33.127 --> 01:08:34.337
I feel good.

01:08:58.569 --> 01:08:59.738
Proof. Yes.

01:09:03.532 --> 01:09:04.575
Hi.

01:09:26.848 --> 01:09:29.142
- They're just appliances.
- I already know it.

01:09:38.651 --> 01:09:39.986
I have no idea.

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:42.781
Yes.

01:09:54.417 --> 01:09:55.417
Eddie Garrett.

01:09:56.335 --> 01:09:58.880
- Who is he?
- My collector.

01:09:58.963 --> 01:10:01.382
- What is a collector?
- You do not know?

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.885
The one who takes all my money.

01:10:03.968 --> 01:10:05.804
We do not have anyone else on the list.

01:10:06.888 --> 01:10:08.139
Come on, man.

01:10:08.222 --> 01:10:09.766
We drove from the city.

01:10:09.849 --> 01:10:11.100
I thought I might come in.

01:10:11.184 --> 01:10:12.185
Come on.

01:10:13.144 --> 01:10:14.187
Thank you.

01:10:17.148 --> 01:10:20.026
Hi. They want to drink something.

01:10:20.109 --> 01:10:21.694
Yes. A whiskey.

01:10:39.963 --> 01:10:41.505
They play hold'em, right?

01:10:41.589 --> 01:10:42.882
Yes it is.

01:10:42.966 --> 01:10:45.509
Why at that table?
It should be in the long run.

01:10:46.427 --> 01:10:47.636
The owner decided.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.181
But it's not a hold'em table.
It's strange, is not it?

01:10:50.264 --> 01:10:52.475
I don't know. It is the
table that the owner likes.

01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:55.019
I would not worry.

01:10:55.103 --> 01:10:58.064
I do not worry, but it's
not a hold'em table.

01:10:58.147 --> 01:10:59.273
There is a free place.

01:10:59.357 --> 01:11:00.358
Yes.

01:11:08.825 --> 01:11:10.493
- Do it fast.
- It's $ 500.

01:11:10.576 --> 01:11:11.577
Are they dollars?

01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:13.246
- Five.
- Yens.

01:11:13.329 --> 01:11:14.455
All right. Bet.

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:17.708
The blues brothers!

01:11:18.877 --> 01:11:20.461
They still owe you money.

01:11:21.689 --> 01:11:22.689
Very good.

01:11:22.713 --> 01:11:24.549
- I like your shoes.
- Thank you.

01:11:24.632 --> 01:11:25.633
It's 15.

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:27.676
It's $ 15,000.

01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:29.888
The bet is $ 15,000.

01:11:30.679 --> 01:11:32.039
I thought there were five of them.

01:11:32.063 --> 01:11:33.141
Not tonight.

01:11:33.224 --> 01:11:34.893
- Fifteen.
- Are they 15?

01:11:34.976 --> 01:11:35.976
Game for adults.

01:11:36.477 --> 01:11:39.730
- We played like that the last 24 hours.
- All right. Save me the seat.

01:11:47.363 --> 01:11:49.073
They say that they are 15.

01:11:49.157 --> 01:11:50.824
Fifteen more, or in total?

01:11:50.909 --> 01:11:52.785
- What?
- Fifteen more or 15 in total?

01:11:52.869 --> 01:11:56.455
They said that... I already put
five, so there are ten more.

01:11:56.539 --> 01:11:58.582
- Very good.
- And they act like imbeciles.

01:11:58.666 --> 01:12:00.793
Guy said something about
the blues brothers.

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:03.880
- Do you want us to leave?
- Do not.

01:12:03.963 --> 01:12:05.589
I will not leave now.

01:12:05.673 --> 01:12:07.216
Get your hands off.

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.385
I can not spend so much time doing this.

01:12:09.468 --> 01:12:12.180
Besides, you should have everything ready.

01:12:12.263 --> 01:12:13.806
It is part of the matter.

01:12:14.848 --> 01:12:16.142
The guy runs like a god.

01:12:17.601 --> 01:12:18.686
Tokens, please.

01:12:18.769 --> 01:12:20.438
He also lies now.

01:12:23.274 --> 01:12:24.943
- Yes.
- You lied to that?

01:12:25.026 --> 01:12:26.945
- It's $ 15,000. Luck.
- Thank you.

01:12:27.028 --> 01:12:28.821
- Yes.
- Well done.

01:12:28.905 --> 01:12:30.907
You can cut your hair with that money.

01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:32.700
Pitbull is not joking.

01:12:34.953 --> 01:12:36.495
Welcome, sir. Yes.

01:12:37.413 --> 01:12:39.749
- I'm Brad.
- Hello. I am Eddie. Charmed.

01:12:39.832 --> 01:12:42.168
- The chips and the money.
- Small, big.

01:12:48.716 --> 01:12:50.426
- How much is it?
- At $ 1,750.

01:12:51.177 --> 01:12:52.428
Equal.

01:12:55.348 --> 01:12:56.432
I go up.

01:12:56.515 --> 01:12:57.808
It is cheaper to retire.

01:12:58.517 --> 01:13:00.019
If you retire, you do not win.

01:13:03.897 --> 01:13:05.066
All right, I'm leaving.

01:13:08.277 --> 01:13:11.447
- Small, big?
- You had a four. It was no use.

01:13:12.656 --> 01:13:14.492
- Did you have a king?
- Do not.

01:13:14.575 --> 01:13:16.285
With a partner, you had the best hand.

01:13:16.369 --> 01:13:18.454
I had it. Shit.

01:13:20.706 --> 01:13:22.041
They are good letters.

01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:23.334
Thank my lord.

01:13:24.252 --> 01:13:25.378
<i>Straddle?</i>

01:13:25.461 --> 01:13:26.712
Yes.

01:13:26.795 --> 01:13:28.131
Let them be $ 1,000.

01:13:29.966 --> 01:13:31.342
Well, we have a well.

01:13:33.261 --> 01:13:35.221
It has to be a joke.

01:13:37.306 --> 01:13:38.306
I retire.

01:13:40.101 --> 01:13:41.269
<i>Can I enter the end?</i>

01:13:41.352 --> 01:13:42.478
- Clear.
- All right.

01:13:44.813 --> 01:13:45.813
Fifteen, Nick.

01:13:46.774 --> 01:13:47.816
Fifteen fewer.

01:13:50.278 --> 01:13:51.612
- Ten.
- Very good.

01:13:51.695 --> 01:13:53.281
The bet is $ 700.

01:13:53.364 --> 01:13:54.365
That's five.

01:13:55.283 --> 01:13:56.284
Records!

01:13:56.367 --> 01:13:57.410
Fifteen.

01:14:01.164 --> 01:14:02.498
It's $ 15,000. Good luck, sir.

01:14:02.581 --> 01:14:03.582
Thank my lord.

01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:05.751
I'm going with $ 4,000.

01:14:07.961 --> 01:14:09.297
$ 4,000? Yes.

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.132
- $ 4,000.
- $ 4,000.

01:14:14.385 --> 01:14:15.636
It is a very good card.

01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:18.139
I'll go ahead and bet whatever it is.

01:14:18.222 --> 01:14:19.307
What is that?

01:14:20.266 --> 01:14:22.935
Are you betting on some logic?

01:14:23.019 --> 01:14:24.228
Or simply...?

01:14:24.312 --> 01:14:25.688
You bet on everything? Yes.

01:14:25.771 --> 01:14:28.732
Do not you even think?
You throw a coin in the air.

01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:31.735
Two for $ 10,000.

01:14:31.819 --> 01:14:34.322
Do not fuck with me.

01:14:35.323 --> 01:14:36.740
You do not have a queen.

01:14:37.533 --> 01:14:38.909
Find out for $ 10,000.

01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:43.330
I go with everything.

01:14:43.997 --> 01:14:44.998
All.

01:14:48.377 --> 01:14:49.378
I cover it.

01:14:51.047 --> 01:14:52.631
- Let's see.
- By...

01:14:55.343 --> 01:14:56.635
- I am sorry.
- Good hand.

01:14:57.678 --> 01:14:58.721
Save me the seat.

01:14:59.597 --> 01:15:00.764
Seat saved.

01:15:10.066 --> 01:15:11.525
Motherfucker.

01:15:13.944 --> 01:15:18.282
They are playing like crazy, and I do
not want to toss one coin at a time.

01:15:18.366 --> 01:15:19.825
I can not do it.

01:15:20.576 --> 01:15:22.453
I'm too scared.

01:15:32.296 --> 01:15:34.507
If I had known, I would not have come.

01:15:37.301 --> 01:15:39.011
Damn... this is...

01:15:40.596 --> 01:15:41.597
So...

01:15:43.474 --> 01:15:44.600
I have to flee.

01:15:45.935 --> 01:15:48.896
I must leave the city.
I have money to start.

01:15:49.438 --> 01:15:51.607
I do not know where the
fuck I'm going to go.

01:16:04.787 --> 01:16:07.498
<i>Hi, Eddie, it's Emma.</i>

01:16:07.581 --> 01:16:10.959
<i>My mom and I...
Well, technically, my mom...</i>

01:16:12.837 --> 01:16:15.256
<i>Ask if you prefer chicken or steak.</i>

01:16:15.839 --> 01:16:18.592
<i>I want to meet you.</i>

01:16:20.678 --> 01:16:23.222
<i>Send me a message, okay?
Tell me what you prefer.</i>

01:16:24.223 --> 01:16:26.309
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

01:16:46.287 --> 01:16:47.621
Let's play the cards.

01:17:01.719 --> 01:17:03.221
Tokens, please!

01:17:03.304 --> 01:17:04.930
- How many?
- A lot!

01:17:08.184 --> 01:17:10.018
He is Jamie. It is at your service.

01:17:10.603 --> 01:17:12.313
Jamie! "How are you, knight?"

01:17:16.275 --> 01:17:17.360
I walk up and up.

01:17:23.782 --> 01:17:25.659
If Stan bet, me too.

01:17:27.661 --> 01:17:29.830
I told you. King, nine.
That gave you problems.

01:17:29.913 --> 01:17:31.249
That's why I smiled.

01:17:34.126 --> 01:17:36.044
Very good. I'm going to take a break.

01:17:36.128 --> 01:17:37.505
Brian will replace me. Luck.

01:17:40.466 --> 01:17:41.675
This is for you.

01:17:41.759 --> 01:17:43.802
- Health.
- Health.

01:17:49.933 --> 01:17:51.852
I had a ladder.

01:17:56.899 --> 01:17:58.234
You should retire.

01:18:05.324 --> 01:18:06.450
Do you walk or bet?

01:18:14.166 --> 01:18:15.167
He passed.

01:18:16.084 --> 01:18:17.253
The Ace is here.

01:18:22.466 --> 01:18:23.467
He passed.

01:18:24.385 --> 01:18:25.594
You are next.

01:18:31.224 --> 01:18:32.310
We must see it.

01:18:32.393 --> 01:18:33.602
- Let's see.
- You want?

01:18:34.562 --> 01:18:35.854
Take it off.

01:18:35.938 --> 01:18:37.523
Check it out.

01:18:39.107 --> 01:18:40.734
How sensual.

01:18:41.652 --> 01:18:44.237
- Yes!
- Come on!

01:18:44.321 --> 01:18:46.532
- I win! The highest color!
- And the last!

01:18:47.533 --> 01:18:48.701
Yes!

01:18:48.784 --> 01:18:52.913
Of doses and tens...
- Amazing. - Shit!

01:18:53.914 --> 01:18:55.291
Yes. I got the lost back.

01:18:55.374 --> 01:18:56.374
I did it.

01:18:56.959 --> 01:18:58.419
I did it. That time was $ 6,000.

01:18:58.502 --> 01:19:01.130
- Let's move on.
- I've got 100 more. I did it, shit!

01:19:01.213 --> 01:19:02.923
You should have seen that hand.

01:19:03.006 --> 01:19:05.426
I made them dust.

01:19:05.509 --> 01:19:07.010
Let's move on. Take the money.
Yes.

01:19:07.094 --> 01:19:08.637
I find it hard to breathe.

01:19:09.513 --> 01:19:10.639
- Ray...
- What?

01:19:10.723 --> 01:19:11.974
- If I were...
- Let's move on.

01:19:12.057 --> 01:19:13.517
Yes I go. Hold on. One second.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.602
- Give him his money.
- Do not!

01:19:15.686 --> 01:19:16.937
Wait. I did not say that.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:18.063
- Do not...
- I enter.

01:19:18.146 --> 01:19:19.666
- It will be right back.
- Cover it up.

01:19:19.690 --> 01:19:21.484
- I feel strange.
- Let's move on. You did.

01:19:21.567 --> 01:19:22.735
We have a lot of money.

01:19:22.818 --> 01:19:23.819
Give him the money.

01:19:23.902 --> 01:19:25.153
Wait. Do not! I did not say...

01:19:25.237 --> 01:19:27.531
- Wait! I do not want to go out.
- Give it...

01:19:27.615 --> 01:19:29.867
I do not want...
Hears. It's over.

01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:31.744
It is a mistake that I leave now.

01:19:31.827 --> 01:19:33.120
I'm serious.

01:19:33.203 --> 01:19:34.330
- Two more hands.
- Do not.

01:19:34.413 --> 01:19:36.374
I play a couple more. If I lose...

01:19:36.457 --> 01:19:38.751
- Come on.
- I feel like I have...

01:19:38.834 --> 01:19:40.336
- You have the money.
- I know.

01:19:40.419 --> 01:19:42.921
And I have 100 more.

01:19:43.005 --> 01:19:46.216
So I play until...
Just a moment.

01:19:46.299 --> 01:19:47.843
- Shit.
- Are you crazy.

01:19:47.926 --> 01:19:49.345
- I had...
- Give it...

01:19:51.764 --> 01:19:53.223
Give him the money.

01:19:53.306 --> 01:19:56.226
He's giving me a heart attack.

01:19:56.309 --> 01:19:57.936
He's giving me a heart attack!

01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:00.356
It hurts a lot, shit!

01:20:00.439 --> 01:20:01.439
I'm dying.

01:20:02.024 --> 01:20:03.859
Help me, I'm dying.

01:20:03.942 --> 01:20:05.778
Can you call 911?

01:20:07.154 --> 01:20:08.406
Give her your money!

01:20:27.841 --> 01:20:28.967
Do not die.

01:20:29.051 --> 01:20:30.928
Please! Faster!

01:20:31.011 --> 01:20:33.180
I can not exceed 80 km /
h in this neighborhood.

01:20:33.263 --> 01:20:35.348
I do not want to die!

01:20:36.016 --> 01:20:38.185
Not yet!

01:20:39.645 --> 01:20:41.772
Do not!

01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:46.485
Do not!

01:20:55.035 --> 01:20:56.995
Heavens.

01:20:57.788 --> 01:20:59.164
How are you?

01:20:59.247 --> 01:21:00.958
All right. I mean...

01:21:01.667 --> 01:21:02.876
You will be fine.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.169
They say you'll get well.

01:21:04.252 --> 01:21:05.421
- Yes?
- You're good.

01:21:05.504 --> 01:21:07.548
I'm fine? Yes.

01:21:07.631 --> 01:21:09.007
All right. Nicky told me.

01:21:09.466 --> 01:21:11.718
I'm not that person anymore.

01:21:11.802 --> 01:21:14.805
I swear, I'm not like that anymore.

01:21:14.888 --> 01:21:16.014
I know.

01:21:16.098 --> 01:21:19.977
- Really, it's not like before.
- Agree.

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:22.855
I want to go to work
and enter the company.

01:21:22.938 --> 01:21:24.815
And so it will be.

01:21:24.898 --> 01:21:26.483
- I'm sorry.
- Really?

01:21:26.567 --> 01:21:27.818
- If it is okay.
- All right.

01:21:27.901 --> 01:21:30.153
Do you say it because I'm in the hospital?

01:21:30.237 --> 01:21:31.238
Maybe a little.

01:21:31.321 --> 01:21:33.115
Because the robe suits you.

01:21:33.198 --> 01:21:34.741
I'm taking you by the hair

01:21:35.117 --> 01:21:36.869
I'm serious. That's me.

01:21:36.952 --> 01:21:39.621
You're good. Everything is fine, okay?

01:21:39.705 --> 01:21:40.873
I'm glad you're back.

01:21:42.374 --> 01:21:44.334
- Do you know what time it is?
- 6:30.

01:21:47.337 --> 01:21:50.382
- What's going on?
- Can you give me my phone?

01:21:50.466 --> 01:21:52.593
I must call Eva.
I should see her at 7:00.

01:21:52.676 --> 01:21:53.969
Today I will meet your daughter.

01:21:54.052 --> 01:21:55.095
The phone was not there.

01:21:55.178 --> 01:21:57.222
They are the wallet, the
keys and the chain.

01:21:57.306 --> 01:21:58.640
But not the phone.

01:22:00.142 --> 01:22:02.269
- It's okay.
- Not well.

01:22:02.352 --> 01:22:05.606
I call it. Is nothing. Just relax.
Do not give you another attack. I call her.

01:22:07.733 --> 01:22:08.859
What is your number?

01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:12.738
I do not know by heart.

01:22:12.821 --> 01:22:14.447
- Do not?
- It's on my phone.

01:22:14.532 --> 01:22:16.324
Do not you remember her number?

01:22:16.408 --> 01:22:18.619
- What's wrong?
- This is not the time to bother me.

01:22:18.702 --> 01:22:21.497
I remember my girlfriend's high
school number. I am sorry.

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:24.583
- I can take. Come on.
- We have to go now.

01:22:24.667 --> 01:22:27.044
- Right now.
- We'll be late anyway.

01:22:27.127 --> 01:22:29.922
Careless. We're leaving.
I carry you. You're going to look elegant.

01:22:30.005 --> 01:22:32.758
- Leave the gown.
- I'm not going to leave it to me.

01:22:32.841 --> 01:22:34.217
- Leave her alone.
- Do not.

01:22:34.301 --> 01:22:35.803
Well, right there. Yes.

01:22:35.886 --> 01:22:37.262
Perfect.

01:22:37.345 --> 01:22:39.640
Hey, Ron. Thank you.

01:22:39.723 --> 01:22:41.308
- I love you.
- And I to you.

01:22:41.391 --> 01:22:43.060
- Very good.
- Very good.

01:23:11.004 --> 01:23:12.324
- I will explain you.
- Seriously?

01:23:12.381 --> 01:23:14.633
- Let me explain you.
- You're 45 minutes late.

01:23:14.717 --> 01:23:16.343
I did not want to be late.

01:23:16.426 --> 01:23:17.595
- I called you...
- I know.

01:23:17.678 --> 01:23:19.638
But I did not have the phone.

01:23:19.722 --> 01:23:21.890
My phone was in one
place, and I in another.

01:23:21.974 --> 01:23:23.391
- No more excuses.
- I do not...

01:23:23.475 --> 01:23:25.310
He had a heart attack.

01:23:25.393 --> 01:23:27.395
- What?
- He had a heart attack.

01:23:27.479 --> 01:23:29.940
I had... I had a problem with the heart,

01:23:30.023 --> 01:23:32.201
I fell to the ground and
was taken to the hospital.

01:23:32.213 --> 01:23:32.943
Oh, my god.

01:23:33.026 --> 01:23:34.277
Here is the proof.

01:23:34.361 --> 01:23:35.654
- Yes.
- You're good?

01:23:35.738 --> 01:23:37.072
Physically I'm fine.

01:23:37.155 --> 01:23:39.116
- I must follow up...
- Enters.

01:23:39.199 --> 01:23:40.242
Missing analysis.

01:23:40.325 --> 01:23:41.702
- Do not...
- Tell me later.

01:23:41.785 --> 01:23:44.622
Agree. But no...
- Agree. - Good.

01:23:44.705 --> 01:23:47.833
- Look who's here.
- Here they are. Hello!

01:23:47.916 --> 01:23:49.209
- Hello.
- How are you?

01:23:49.292 --> 01:23:50.711
Nice to meet you.

01:23:50.794 --> 01:23:52.129
Equally.

01:23:52.212 --> 01:23:54.131
I heard you speak very well. Yes.

01:23:54.214 --> 01:23:55.215
Thank you.

01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.136
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

01:23:59.219 --> 01:24:01.263
- Nice to meet you.
- Equally.

01:24:02.890 --> 01:24:03.932
I was dying to meet you.

01:24:04.016 --> 01:24:06.727
Did you die? I'm dying to meet you.

01:24:06.810 --> 01:24:10.814
I've wanted to meet you for a long time.
I can not believe I'm seeing you.

01:24:10.898 --> 01:24:13.191
It's great for me. Thank you.

01:24:18.238 --> 01:24:20.157
Do I sit here? Yes.

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:21.449
Very good.

01:25:29.267 --> 01:25:30.518
There's $ 400 more.

01:25:31.978 --> 01:25:32.978
What?

01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:35.065
It's all money.
I counted it twice.

01:25:35.148 --> 01:25:37.400
But there are $ 400 more.

01:25:38.485 --> 01:25:39.527
How?

01:25:39.611 --> 01:25:40.971
- I do not know.
- How it happened?

01:25:41.029 --> 01:25:42.030
Has no sense.

01:25:42.114 --> 01:25:43.490
<i>If you like, I'll tell you again.</i>

01:25:43.573 --> 01:25:45.367
<i>- Yes, tell it again.
- Very good.</i>

01:25:45.450 --> 01:25:46.744
<i>Fuck, man.</i>
