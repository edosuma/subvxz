00:02.838 --> 00:05.206
<i>(j.D.) sacred heart--
eight years of great memories.</i>

00:05.207 --> 00:08.610
<i>This place will live forever.</i>

00:08.611 --> 00:10.912
<i>They tore down
the old crappy hospital</i>

00:10.913 --> 00:13.515
<i>And rebuilt it
on the med school campus.</i>

00:13.516 --> 00:15.783
<i>I'm just back
to teach some classes.</i>

00:15.784 --> 00:18.920
<i>First, though, I need to do
my morning good luck ritual.</i>

00:18.921 --> 00:21.990
And seven.
That's one good luck kiss

00:21.991 --> 00:24.058
For every month
you've been in there.

00:24.059 --> 00:26.694
Are you done yet?
Not yet.

00:26.695 --> 00:29.497
And thank you for making
mommy's boobs so much bigger.

00:29.498 --> 00:31.166
They're almost jugs.

00:31.167 --> 00:34.469
Seriously, I think I can
probably rest 'em on your head.

00:34.470 --> 00:36.571
Check it out.
Okay. Yeah.

00:36.572 --> 00:40.475
Whoa! Talk about
a 10-gallon hat.
(chuckles) how cool is that?

00:40.476 --> 00:44.712
Donny, no questions right now,
okay? This is private.
They're still looking.

00:44.713 --> 00:48.016
I said this is private!
Turn around!

00:48.017 --> 00:51.519
That was heavy.
Hey, do good today.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.988
Bye.
Bye.

00:53.989 --> 00:58.393
I can still feel them
on my head.

00:58.394 --> 01:01.963
How sweet is he?

01:01.964 --> 01:05.300
<i>Part of me hates
how familiar this seems.</i>

01:05.301 --> 01:08.136
<i>I hope I can find a way
to make this all feel new.</i>

01:08.137 --> 01:10.138
<i>(woman) oh, my god.
The first day of med school.</i>

01:10.139 --> 01:13.141
<i>Everything is so new. I mean,
just look at all these people</i>

01:13.142 --> 01:16.311
<i>Who don't know that I used to
wear a back brace.</i>

01:16.312 --> 01:18.913
<i>I can look left.</i>

01:18.914 --> 01:22.784
<i>Yep, new sights, new sounds,
even new smells.</i>

01:24.153 --> 01:25.920
Kiwi.

01:25.921 --> 01:28.289
What?
I smell kiwi.

01:28.290 --> 01:30.992
Yeah, it's my shampoo.
I love kiwis, okay?

01:30.993 --> 01:33.461
I love them, too!
Actually, that's not true.

01:33.462 --> 01:35.997
They're hairy.
They look like monkey nuts.

01:35.998 --> 01:38.032
Don't smell people.
It's weird.

01:38.033 --> 01:40.001
I'm lucy.

01:40.002 --> 01:42.103
I don't care!

01:42.104 --> 01:45.039
<i>Regroup, lucy. Find an ally.</i>

01:45.040 --> 01:47.709
Hi. I'm lucy.

01:47.710 --> 01:50.111
Cool. Hey, after class,

01:50.112 --> 01:52.947
You want to go somewhere,
get weird with each other?

01:52.948 --> 01:56.251
I feel like you skipped
a few steps.
Hey, come on. You already know
if you're in or out.

01:56.252 --> 02:03.591
So what's the deal, girl?

02:03.592 --> 02:06.761
Not interested.

02:06.762 --> 02:09.130
Medicine is...

02:11.066 --> 02:13.368
Well, it's a dead career.

02:13.369 --> 02:15.937
Thanks to insurance companies
and malpractice lawyers,

02:15.938 --> 02:19.040
You have absolutely no hope

02:19.041 --> 02:21.976
Of finding a rewarding
or satisfying profession

02:21.977 --> 02:24.946
In this once noble field.

02:24.947 --> 02:29.217
The only exception to this very
true rule is the following--

02:29.218 --> 02:34.155
<i>If you are lucky enough to go
to a great medical school,</i>

02:34.156 --> 02:39.427
Then, my children,
you got a real shot.

02:39.428 --> 02:43.064
Because to call this particular
school a "crap house"

02:43.065 --> 02:45.166
Would be
an honest-to-god compliment.

02:45.167 --> 02:47.902
Plus, m the only teacher here
worth a damn,

02:47.903 --> 02:50.705
And I already hate
each and every one of you.

02:50.706 --> 02:53.374
Would you like to know why?

02:53.375 --> 02:54.842
Well, it turns out

02:54.843 --> 02:57.045
You're not actually
medical studen at all.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.180
You are all murderers
and assassins

02:59.181 --> 03:02.283
That have been sent here
to try to kill my patients.

03:02.284 --> 03:04.118
Here's the bottom line--

03:04.119 --> 03:07.088
If you do get a good clean kill
on a patient,

03:07.089 --> 03:12.760
Go ahead and take a pinkie
or an ear as a trophy.

03:12.761 --> 03:15.363
I am ready for you,
have been for a while,

03:15.364 --> 03:18.032
So watch your ass. Good day.

03:18.033 --> 03:20.835
Okay. I hope everyone enjoyed
orientation with dr. Cox.

03:20.836 --> 03:23.171
I'm dr. Mahoney,
your student advisor.

03:23.172 --> 03:27.175
Here's some crappy pizza.

03:27.176 --> 03:28.876
Joining us, gramps?

03:28.877 --> 03:31.479
You know, 'cause you're old
for a med student.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.115
They told me to give out
fun nicknames for team building.

03:34.116 --> 03:36.417
It's working.

03:36.418 --> 03:37.752
Look, uh, drew,

03:37.753 --> 03:41.222
I don't like dealing with,
well, people.

03:41.223 --> 03:44.058
And all these kids
obviously look up to you.

03:44.059 --> 03:47.028
I've never spoken
to any of these people.

03:47.029 --> 03:49.130
I can still feel a bond,
and I thought,

03:49.131 --> 03:51.466
Why don't you deal with
the whiny, emotional stuff?

03:51.467 --> 03:54.635
And in return,
I will let you do that.

03:54.636 --> 03:57.739
Look, just, uh, let me fly
under the radar.

03:57.740 --> 04:02.877
Please.

04:02.878 --> 04:06.280
I guess I should answer any
annoying questions you all have.

04:06.281 --> 04:08.282
Yeah, monkey nuts.

04:08.283 --> 04:10.952
Uh, I just wanted to thank you,
on behalf of all of us,

04:10.953 --> 04:12.687
For getting us pizza.

04:12.688 --> 04:15.189
<i>There. Smelling incident fixed.</i>

04:15.190 --> 04:17.257
<i>Yeah, they gave me money
to do it,</i>

04:17.259 --> 04:19.226
Along with
free room and board

04:19.228 --> 04:21.262
To attend
to your emotional needs.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.798
Speaking of which,
little administrative thing--

04:23.799 --> 04:25.767
If you're going to
kill yourself--

04:25.768 --> 04:27.735
I'm looking at you,
sad eyes--

04:27.736 --> 04:29.804
Do it off campus,

04:29.805 --> 04:32.573
'cause it is a buttload
of paperwork.

04:32.574 --> 04:34.809
All right, everyone,
pay attention,

04:34.810 --> 04:39.447
Because my spleen is right here.

04:39.448 --> 04:41.015
Whoops!

04:41.016 --> 04:43.284
This feels more like
my private-time area.

04:43.285 --> 04:46.654
Wouldn't it be easier if you
could see what you were doing?

04:46.655 --> 04:48.956
This is the way I'm doing it,
cole!

04:48.957 --> 04:50.958
Or maybe
you're just uncomfortable

04:50.959 --> 04:54.028
Because it's a black man's head
on a fake white man's body.

04:54.029 --> 04:56.864
That's right, people.
It just got real up in here.

04:56.865 --> 05:00.001
In my class,
you will each be graded

05:00.002 --> 05:04.739
By the color of your skin.

05:04.740 --> 05:05.940
F's.

05:05.941 --> 05:07.275
There he is.

05:07.276 --> 05:08.643
Yes!

05:11.980 --> 05:15.216
Dude!
What the hell are you doing?!

05:15.217 --> 05:17.251
I thought
it'd be more dramatic

05:17.252 --> 05:19.253
If we spotted each other
from afar

05:19.254 --> 05:21.389
<i>And then ran
to see each other!</i>

05:21.390 --> 05:23.357
But now if we meet
in the middle,

05:23.358 --> 05:25.359
We'll wind up somewhere
inside the hospital,

05:25.360 --> 05:28.196
And this really feels like
more of an outside thing!

05:28.197 --> 05:30.164
If you count to ten
before you run,

05:30.165 --> 05:34.435
I should be able to get
downstairs and over to you!
I'm already counting!

05:35.838 --> 05:37.338
Three, four...

05:37.339 --> 05:40.007
Hey, dr. Turk.
Not now, denise.

05:40.008 --> 05:42.310
Turk!

05:42.311 --> 05:43.766

06:15.010 --> 06:17.245
When was the last time
you guys saw each other?

06:17.246 --> 06:18.779
This morning. We carpooled.

06:18.780 --> 06:20.982
But we haven't worked together
in over a year.

06:20.983 --> 06:24.485
You know
what I'd like to do now?
Is it go to vermont
anmake this thing legal?

06:24.486 --> 06:26.988
Talk to the hand.
Remember that?

06:26.989 --> 06:30.024
(high-pitched voice) eagle!

06:30.025 --> 06:31.893
(normal voice)
oh, hey, perry.

06:31.894 --> 06:34.328
I'm really looking forward
to teaching wi you.

06:34.329 --> 06:36.998
Onward.
(high-pitched voice) eagle!

06:36.999 --> 06:40.635
Oh, good god.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.941
I'll have you know
this is the very jacket

06:59.008 --> 07:00.976
Worn by michelle pfeiffer
in "dangerous minds."

07:01.044 --> 07:03.979
All I had to do was sew
these elbow patches on

07:04.047 --> 07:06.014
And take the shoulder pads out.
Hmm.

07:06.082 --> 07:08.317
By the way, what ever
happened to the janitor?

07:08.384 --> 07:11.753
Oh, dude. It was
the day after you left...

07:11.821 --> 07:13.989
When's that little buddy
of yours coming back?

07:14.057 --> 07:17.926
He's never coming back.
He's gone for good.
He's right here, isn't he?

07:17.994 --> 07:20.095
Where would I be hiding him?

07:20.163 --> 07:22.497
But he's coming back...
No.

07:22.565 --> 07:24.266
After his vacation.

07:24.334 --> 07:25.500
No.

07:31.674 --> 07:34.676
And no one ever
saw him again.

07:37.180 --> 07:39.214
Dr. Kelso,
what are you doing her

07:39.282 --> 07:41.016
I'm teaching
a couple of classes.

07:41.084 --> 07:43.085
J.D.'s gonna teach here, too.

07:43.152 --> 07:45.053
<i>(chuckles) oh, turk,
sometimes I'll teach them.</i>

07:45.121 --> 07:46.521
<i>Sometimes they'll teach me,</i>

07:46.589 --> 07:49.691
But we're always going to
inspire each other.

07:49.759 --> 07:51.994
You're still
such an odd little fruit.

07:52.061 --> 07:54.029
Is that woman's jacket?

07:54.097 --> 07:57.065
No, it's a man's small.
Yes, it's actually the jacket
from "dangerous minds."

07:57.133 --> 08:00.035
He doesn't need to know that.

08:00.103 --> 08:02.971
Dr. Kelso, I heard about
enid's passing. I'm so sorry.

08:03.039 --> 08:05.440
Well, you bottom out,

08:05.508 --> 08:07.009
And then you persevere.

08:07.076 --> 08:10.645
(wspers) yeah.
I feel like I can say
the worst is over.

08:10.713 --> 08:13.315
How long ago did she pass?
About two days.

08:14.851 --> 08:16.718
I'm a frequent flier.

08:16.786 --> 08:18.620
Congrats, I guess.

08:18.688 --> 08:22.024
No, no, no. That means I'm in
and out of the hospital a lot.
Oh.

08:22.091 --> 08:24.726
Ben. Ischemic bowel disease.

08:24.794 --> 08:26.895
Lucy. I'm a med student.

08:26.963 --> 08:29.564
You look like
you could use a grape.

08:29.632 --> 08:32.366
Thanks, ben. I really could.
No stealing food
from patients.

08:32.434 --> 08:35.470
Gather 'round, murderers.
Gather 'round.

08:35.538 --> 08:38.306
I saw that. Spit it out.

08:38.374 --> 08:40.075
Now eat it again.

08:40.143 --> 08:43.311
<i>At least we know
you're a good listener.
Score!</i>

08:43.379 --> 08:45.414
You should all follow 19's lead,

08:45.481 --> 08:49.284
And I call her "19," because
instead of using your names,

08:49.352 --> 08:51.853
I'm going to go by where
you currently rank in my hd.

08:51.921 --> 08:54.689
Now who can tell me what artery

08:54.757 --> 08:58.393
Goes above the optic chiasm
to the cerebral hemispheres?

08:58.461 --> 09:00.162
Supermodel in the back.

09:00.229 --> 09:02.164
(australian accent)
I'm fairly certain

09:02.231 --> 09:04.966
It's the anterior
cerebral artery.
What?

09:07.770 --> 09:10.305
I'm not understanding a word
ththat she's saying,l artery.

09:10.373 --> 09:12.340
And, people,
I can teach anyone.

09:12.408 --> 09:15.110
You just gotta speak english.

09:15.178 --> 09:17.579
I'm australian.
Still not getting it.

09:17.647 --> 09:20.315
Everyone, leave. (whistles)

09:21.751 --> 09:24.219
I'm sorry
about the grape thing.

09:24.287 --> 09:28.457
Oh, don't sweat it, 42.
Is my number going down
because I'm talking to you?

09:31.394 --> 09:34.329
Why was michael in my room?

09:34.397 --> 09:37.332
His name isn't michael.
Well, he has a weird
serbian name that I can't say,

09:37.400 --> 09:39.334
So I'm calling him michael.
He loves it.

09:39.402 --> 09:41.903
I don't. My name is ilyevic.

09:41.971 --> 09:43.438
Mike, just go.

09:43.506 --> 09:46.441
<i>Young michael informed me
that you told everyone</i>

09:46.509 --> 09:48.610
To come to me
with their personal problems.

09:48.678 --> 09:50.846
Yeah, I did.
I checked on you.

09:50.913 --> 09:52.814
You've already been
to med school

09:52.882 --> 09:54.816
Once already
when you were 21.

09:54.884 --> 09:57.919
And you didn't just flame out,
you, like, you went nuclear.

09:57.987 --> 10:00.388
Seriously, how was prison?
It was cold.

10:00.389 --> 10:03.425
You couldn't just let me be.
Well, I'm gonna take

10:03.426 --> 10:06.228
The high road and not mention
your mannish voice

10:06.229 --> 10:09.131
And all the pictures you have
in here of your friends.

10:09.132 --> 10:12.634
Tell me,
which one's your b.F.F.?
You are a giant douche.

10:12.635 --> 10:14.836
I know.

10:14.837 --> 10:16.638
Want to take a shower
together?

10:16.639 --> 10:18.507
Fine.

10:18.508 --> 10:22.244
I know you think you're so hot,
but I'm not a fan.

10:22.245 --> 10:28.817
Hey, I'm not happy about this
either, okay?

10:28.818 --> 10:31.786
Welcome
to internal medicine, gang.

10:31.787 --> 10:35.090
My name is dr. John dorian.

10:35.091 --> 10:37.959
Hey,
should we be taking notes?

10:37.960 --> 10:39.761
That's a good question, fellow.

10:39.762 --> 10:41.863
What I'll tell you is
I don't like to really stop.

10:41.864 --> 10:43.398
That ruins my flow.

10:43.399 --> 10:46.535
So what I'm gonna do is give
a subtle nod like so...

10:46.536 --> 10:48.603
As a signal, okay?

10:48.604 --> 10:50.772
Now back to my name.

10:50.773 --> 10:52.674
I prefer "dr. D.,"
or in a pinch, "dr. Dizzle."

10:52.675 --> 10:55.710
But if you see me
out in the quad--
there is no quad.

10:55.711 --> 10:59.214
I'm not a big fan of the t.A.S
doing a lot of speaking, denise.

10:59.215 --> 11:00.682
Okay?

11:00.683 --> 11:03.018
Oh, wait. Wait. That was
an accidental nod, you guys.

11:03.019 --> 11:05.587
No note taking.
No note taking, okay?

11:05.588 --> 11:08.990
Now if you see me
out in the quad...

11:08.991 --> 11:11.893
I want you to think of me
as more than your teacher.

11:11.894 --> 11:15.363
I'm also your friend, all right?

11:15.364 --> 11:17.933
Okay, we're definitely
gonna need a new signal

11:17.934 --> 11:20.402
For the note-taking thing.

11:20.403 --> 11:22.671
This guy's trying
to die on me again.

11:22.672 --> 11:25.340
Who wants to play
patient roulette?

11:25.341 --> 11:27.008
<i>Please not me. Please not me.</i>

11:31.147 --> 11:34.482
There ain't no use runnin',
little girl!

11:34.483 --> 11:37.252
First one to bring me
a med student gets a juicy bone.

11:37.253 --> 11:40.021
He gets a juicy bone.
You gotta yell!

11:41.390 --> 11:44.259
91, here's how we play.

11:44.260 --> 11:46.995
I'm not gonna do anything
to help this dying man

11:46.996 --> 11:49.397
Until you answer these
three very simple questions--

11:49.398 --> 11:51.233
At is it called
when a blood clot

11:51.234 --> 11:53.335
Occludes a branch
of the pulmonary artery?

11:53.336 --> 11:55.370
What is it called when
tuberculosis affects the spine?

11:55.371 --> 11:58.273
And what was the name
of the african nba center

11:58.274 --> 12:01.009
Who did this
whenever he blocked a shot?

12:01.010 --> 12:03.745
Oh, I'd hurry.
His heart's slowing down.

12:03.746 --> 12:05.780
And he's dead,

12:05.781 --> 12:08.316
Not because of you.
I'm not insane.

12:08.317 --> 12:11.019
He was dead
when we walked over here.

12:11.020 --> 12:14.456
But just a stunningly
horrible job nonetheless.

12:17.960 --> 12:20.962
All right. We finally found
a signal that works--jazz hands.

12:20.963 --> 12:22.163
Love it.

12:22.164 --> 12:24.299
Guys, tomorrow you'll be divided
into groups,

12:24.300 --> 12:26.301
And you'll be given
your cadavers.

12:26.302 --> 12:28.603
So great first day, everybody.

12:28.604 --> 12:31.539
Who wants to keep this party
going?

12:31.540 --> 12:34.509
If so,
meet me back here at 6:00.

12:34.510 --> 12:37.145
I will have beers, on me.

12:37.146 --> 12:40.148
Everyone take a mixed cd
on their way out.

12:40.149 --> 12:43.451
For those of you who are fans
of a young miss miley cyrus,

12:43.452 --> 12:45.353
I recommend the green ones.

12:45.354 --> 12:48.290
She's heavily featured.

12:48.291 --> 12:51.259
Dr. Cox?
Professor.

12:51.260 --> 12:53.495
Professor cox?
Actually it's both.

12:53.496 --> 12:56.197
Dr. Professor cox?
Yes?

12:56.198 --> 12:59.034
Sometimes I feel like you're
not even trying to teach me.

12:59.035 --> 13:01.036
I'm not.
I generally don't waste time

13:01.037 --> 13:05.307
With people
who aren't gonna make it.
Oh. Thanks.

13:05.308 --> 13:07.208
<i>Thanks?</i>

13:11.681 --> 13:14.683
Hey. Can I talk to you
for a sec?

13:14.684 --> 13:18.086
What do you want?
Well, um, I get the whole
trial-by-fire thing--

13:18.087 --> 13:21.222
And you're wonderful at it,
really.
Don't ever touch me.

13:21.223 --> 13:23.858
Sorry. Um, but you seem
to go out of your way

13:23.859 --> 13:25.694
To pick on the weakest kids.

13:25.695 --> 13:28.263
Ybe you could,
I don't know, not do that.

13:28.264 --> 13:30.865
Thank you for the feedback.
It's invaluable.

13:30.866 --> 13:33.001
You don't mean that, do you?
I don't.

13:33.002 --> 13:35.970
And since you don't see yourself
as one of the weak ones,

13:35.971 --> 13:38.506
Maybe a good solution
would be for me to unload

13:38.507 --> 13:41.443
My years of rage and frustration
and pain onto your head

13:41.444 --> 13:43.445
And your head alone.

13:43.446 --> 13:46.214
Are--are we locked down to that,
or can we keep spitballing here?

13:46.215 --> 13:48.116
Very locked in.

13:48.117 --> 13:49.584
Looking forward to it.

13:51.120 --> 13:54.823
Not you. Just something I say
whenever I'm pissed...

13:54.824 --> 13:57.492
When I'm with a whore.

13:57.493 --> 13:59.794
Whoa!

13:59.795 --> 14:01.963
None of them showed up.

14:01.964 --> 14:04.099
I got us all these
glow-in-the-dark necklaces

14:04.100 --> 14:06.735
So we wouldn't lose each other
when we were out on the town.

14:06.736 --> 14:08.870
It's their first day
of med school.

14:08.871 --> 14:11.406
Come on.
You remember how we were.

14:12.842 --> 14:14.743
Nerds!
Losers!

14:14.744 --> 14:17.245
(bicycle bell tinkles)
I feel so alive.

14:17.246 --> 14:22.817
Everybody at that party
had sex.

14:22.818 --> 14:26.187
No.

14:26.188 --> 14:28.256
<i>(j.D.) we all go through life</i>

14:28.257 --> 14:30.425
<i>Worrying about
what other people think of us.</i>

14:35.564 --> 14:39.267
Man, I must be
the worst teacher ever.

14:39.268 --> 14:41.603
<i>The truth ,
the harshest words</i>

14:41.604 --> 14:45.340
<i>Are the ones we say
about ourselves.</i>

14:45.341 --> 14:47.642
You okay, sweetie?

14:47.643 --> 14:50.345
No, ben.

14:50.346 --> 14:52.647
I don't belong here.

14:55.990 --> 14:57.858
<i>(lucy)
I was so depressed yesterday.</i>

14:57.926 --> 15:00.828
<i>To cheer myself up, I made what
I think is a great decision.</i>

15:00.895 --> 15:02.763
<i>Sometimes one perfect night</i>

15:02.831 --> 15:05.532
<i>Can change your whole outlook
on life.</i>

15:07.368 --> 15:09.803
(camera phone shutter clicks)

15:09.871 --> 15:13.674
<i>Yep. I've got a good feeling
about this guy.</i>

15:15.710 --> 15:18.679
Hey, darling. I'm dr. Cole.
I'll be your physician.

15:18.746 --> 15:21.482
So... What are we dealing
with here?

15:21.549 --> 15:25.018
Non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
Oh, giant drag.

15:25.086 --> 15:26.186
Hey.

15:26.254 --> 15:27.588
Come here.

15:27.655 --> 15:30.224
Hope you enjoyed your last day
of med school.

15:30.291 --> 15:32.493
Yeah, I don't see it.
I'm sorry. What?

15:32.560 --> 15:34.561
You know that bust
you pass on your way

15:34.629 --> 15:36.463
To pick up
your tiny paycheck?

15:36.531 --> 15:39.533
Notice any resemblance?
Symmetric features, strong jaw.

15:39.601 --> 15:42.636
Yeah, that's my pop-pop--
paid for this whole building.

15:42.704 --> 15:44.638
So here's the skinny--
I'm teflon.

15:44.706 --> 15:47.541
You can fire bullets at me
if you want, but be careful.

15:47.609 --> 15:50.511
When they ricochet off me,
they sometimes hit other people.

15:50.578 --> 15:52.412
Pa-chi. Pa-ching.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.814
Don't pa-chi me.

15:53.882 --> 15:57.251
Pa-ching.
Don't you pa-ching me!

15:57.318 --> 16:00.420
<i>My dad always says
every day is a new day.</i>

16:00.488 --> 16:02.856
<i>So today I'm gonna
be confident, strong,</i>

16:02.924 --> 16:04.992
<i>And nothing will knock me
off my game.</i>

16:06.394 --> 16:08.662
<i>Oh, who am I kidding?</i>

16:08.730 --> 16:10.464
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

16:10.532 --> 16:12.432
Has anyone seen
the crash cart?

16:12.500 --> 16:14.935
Ah, it's, uh,
over by bed four.

16:15.003 --> 16:17.905
Now can you make that out?

16:17.972 --> 16:19.940
I think I heard the words
"bear fight,"

16:20.008 --> 16:22.609
But that makes no sense.

16:22.677 --> 16:24.578
You're right.
That's super fun.

16:24.646 --> 16:27.414
I love doing things with you.
Thanks, perry. I needed that.

16:27.482 --> 16:30.317
I'm having a little trouble
getting my teacher groove going.

16:30.385 --> 16:33.754
Maybe you suck at it.
Why do you have to lash out,
perry?

16:33.821 --> 16:36.957
Stay open for business
in here,

16:37.025 --> 16:38.525
In your heart cage.

16:38.593 --> 16:41.128
I guess I'm just tired
of weeding out the weak

16:41.196 --> 16:45.232
To protect the rest of the herd,
like I always do.
Maybe you could mix it
up a little.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.068
Try in-investing emotionally
in one of them.

16:48.136 --> 16:51.138
A kid stood o me
just the other day,

16:51.206 --> 16:54.041
And... I kind of felt
connected to him.

16:54.108 --> 16:55.609
Good, good, good.

16:55.677 --> 16:57.844
I'm--I'm sure
you probably knew him

16:57.912 --> 17:00.380
For--for all of 30 seconds.
It's not like I tried

17:00.448 --> 17:04.251
For--for eight years or anything
to get your love.
I thought we were over this.

17:06.221 --> 17:08.922
<i>I'm drowning here.
I wish there was just someone</i>

17:08.990 --> 17:12.492
<i>Who could fly up
and rescue me from all this.</i>

17:12.560 --> 17:14.493
<i>(j.D.) I feel like
I'd get back on track</i>

17:14.561 --> 17:17.497
<i>If I could just find
one student to connect with--</i>

17:17.565 --> 17:19.499
<i>One kid that really needs me.</i>

17:19.567 --> 17:22.368
<i>I mean, that's what it's
all about, right? Reaching out.</i>

17:24.239 --> 17:26.506
What's your name?
Drew.

17:26.574 --> 17:29.109
I'm taking an interest
in you.

17:29.177 --> 17:30.811
Carry on.

17:30.878 --> 17:32.946
That's not good for me,
is it?

17:33.014 --> 17:34.948
Drew, you know I d care.

17:35.016 --> 17:37.584
Come on. Grab me like a man.
Let's do this.

17:39.587 --> 17:41.622
Ah, what up, dizzle?

17:41.689 --> 17:44.124
You dropped something.

17:44.192 --> 17:45.993
I got it.

17:46.060 --> 17:48.528
<i>I'm not always a believer
in serpity,</i>

17:48.596 --> 17:52.733
<i>But sometimes the world
just brings things together.</i>

17:54.135 --> 17:56.503
I was chasing that,
so it's mine.

17:56.571 --> 17:59.072
It's a naked picture of me.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.541
It fell out
of that cole kid's notebook.

18:01.609 --> 18:03.944
Oh, don't be sad.

18:04.012 --> 18:05.579
It's just--oh, wow!

18:05.647 --> 18:09.082
That is a very graphic
naked picture of you.

18:09.150 --> 18:12.085
You know, we're gonna go over
a lot of that stuff in class,

18:12.153 --> 18:14.087
So don't worry about it.
I shouldn't have looked.

18:14.155 --> 18:17.691
I'm both a married man
and a beloved professor.
I know. You're dr. Dorian.

18:17.759 --> 18:19.826
This area's
technically the quad,

18:19.894 --> 18:22.362
So it's--it's j.D.

18:22.430 --> 18:24.164
Lucy.

18:24.232 --> 18:26.733
Nice to meet you, lucy.

18:26.801 --> 18:29.736
<i>(lucy) don't let him leave.
Say something, lucy.</i>

18:29.804 --> 18:31.338
J.D.?

18:32.707 --> 18:35.142
Can I help you
with something?

18:35.209 --> 18:37.344
Dr. Cox is all over me.

18:37.412 --> 18:39.346
I can't take it.

18:39.414 --> 18:41.882
Come with me.

18:41.949 --> 18:43.884
Come on.

18:48.022 --> 18:50.123
Lucy, to win
at the game of perry cox,

18:50.191 --> 18:53.160
Yohave to stand up to him.
He just wants to kw

18:53.227 --> 18:55.162
That you're strong enough
to survive here.

18:55.229 --> 18:58.332
So you need to
go ahead and show him.

18:59.934 --> 19:02.903
Dr. Co--dr. Professor cox?

19:02.970 --> 19:05.839
I actually knew the answers
to all your questions.

19:05.907 --> 19:07.341
Check it out--

19:07.408 --> 19:09.343
Pulmonary embolism,
pott's disease

19:09.410 --> 19:12.412
And dikembe mutombo.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.448
That's fabulous.
I dot care.

19:14.515 --> 19:16.917
It's just that
you kept yelling,

19:16.984 --> 19:18.652
And you had that vein thing

19:18.720 --> 19:21.755
Popping out the side
of your head... There it is.

19:21.823 --> 19:24.057
And sometimes I get nervous
under pressure,

19:24.125 --> 19:26.293
And I forget basic...

19:26.361 --> 19:28.729
You know,
the things that you speak.

19:28.796 --> 19:29.963
Words?

19:30.031 --> 19:32.199
Yes! Words.
People speak words.

19:32.266 --> 19:34.701
Look, when you have a patient
coding on the table,

19:34.769 --> 19:37.704
What, are you gonna tell
the whole room to stop screaming

19:37.772 --> 19:41.174
So that you don't get nervous?
No.

19:41.242 --> 19:43.176
Oh, I know that face.

19:43.244 --> 19:45.178
You're a crier.

19:45.246 --> 19:46.646
You cry.

19:46.714 --> 19:49.649
I have not cried once
in my entire adult life,

19:49.717 --> 19:53.120
And I am not gonna start now
because of you.

19:53.187 --> 19:54.755
We'll see.

19:58.459 --> 20:01.428
And, dr. Cox?

20:01.496 --> 20:04.498
If you do make me cry,
it won't be a big deal,

20:04.565 --> 20:07.100
Because I lied.

20:07.168 --> 20:10.937
<i>I cry all the time.</i>

20:11.005 --> 20:12.439
Oh, good god.

20:14.976 --> 20:19.646
<i>(j.D.) little victories count
for a lot around here,</i>

20:19.714 --> 20:22.716
<i>Even if you ner asked to win
in the first place.</i>

20:22.784 --> 20:24.718
(whistles) congrats.

20:24.786 --> 20:26.953
I am now going to expect
more from you

20:27.021 --> 20:29.723
Than I've expected
from a med student ever.

20:31.559 --> 20:33.427
Whore.

20:33.494 --> 20:37.063
<i>And you have to enjoy those
nice moments while you can.</i>

20:37.131 --> 20:41.668
This is your group's cadaver
for the semester.

20:41.736 --> 20:43.036
<i>Because around here,</i>

20:43.104 --> 20:45.238
<i>They never last very long.</i>

20:45.306 --> 20:47.340
Treat him well.

20:47.408 --> 20:50.076
I wonder
what this guy's deal was.

20:50.144 --> 20:51.912
Ben.

20:51.979 --> 20:54.748
His name was ben.

21:04.440 --> 21:08.877
why are we whispering?

21:08.878 --> 21:10.479
And I threw a blanket over
his head and then sat on him.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.682
He doesn't know it's me.
What's your exit strategy?

21:13.683 --> 21:15.917
I haven't really thought
that far ahead.

21:15.918 --> 21:18.854
I got a plan. Todd, can you
come here and sit on this?

21:18.855 --> 21:21.189
Okay. (grunts)

21:21.190 --> 21:23.125
Get him.

21:23.126 --> 21:27.562
Sodude or chick?

21:27.563 --> 21:29.965
I'm good either way.
