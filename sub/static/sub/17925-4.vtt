You speak.
What does Mr Dove's brother do?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.798
Reid believed him
to have been the killer.

00:06.920 --> 00:10.311
REID: The mother's name was
the word he used for Dove.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.919
Guluba.

DOVE: As I understand it, the doctors
have passed you fit, Inspector?

00:15.480 --> 00:16.595
I will be a father to you.

00:16.720 --> 00:19.189
There are Westminster Police
on guard day and night.

bedchambers of the occupants.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.794

an animal, Nathaniel.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.718

- No!

00:31.920 --> 00:34.594

00:41.960 --> 00:44.031
Miss Chudleigh!

00:48.320 --> 00:53.349
SHINE: Windows to the soul, they say.
You spy the semblance of one?

00:54.480 --> 00:56.357
It is the inter-cranial pressure.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.756
You have told me this before.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.474
The hurt of it, however,
daily more savage.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.831
DR LENNON: The pressure
is increasing rapidly.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.519
And?

01:06.640 --> 01:10.156
Given the inefficacy
of my treatments, it's...

01:10.280 --> 01:12.999
most likely glioma.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.555
- English.
- Oh.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.478
Tumour.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.717
Perhaps from...

01:21.840 --> 01:24.150
You did mention historic trauma
to the head?

01:24.280 --> 01:29.354
Yeah, took a proper stoving
in the ring, all right,

01:29.480 --> 01:33.838
from the very man who used to hold
this office, rest his chewed old soul.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.476
Back then, one of you sawbones
said these eyes had gone.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.989
But Jedediah Shine
don't wink out so easy.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.197
I see you,
and I'll see you wrong as he.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.913
DR LENNON: Inspector Shine,

01:47.040 --> 01:50.954
there is not a doctor in this land
who could diagnose definitively.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.070
(RINGING IN HIS HEAD)

01:52.200 --> 01:54.555
Even then,

01:54.680 --> 01:56.637
there lacks...

01:56.760 --> 01:59.320
a medicine for glioma.

01:59.440 --> 02:03.832
I can increase the concentration
of your morphine.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.838
Measure carefully.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.836
At this concentration,

02:09.960 --> 02:12.873
so much as half a phial could see
three men never wake again.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.389
More coca also.
I cannot afford my wits dulled.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.239
DR LENNON: One tabloid per dose.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.476
On no account exceed this.

A man with a crutch
may yet walk an endless mile.

I must warn you, the swelling,

02:28.600 --> 02:31.433

02:32.720 --> 02:36.076
Your brain is crushing itself
against your skull...

02:37.160 --> 02:39.549
...and given the increase
in your agonies...

02:41.120 --> 02:44.636

by no means distant.

You are saying that I,
Jedediah Shine, am on his last rounds?

03:00.080 --> 03:03.755
I begin to consider it a medical miracle
you've survived this long.

03:07.240 --> 03:10.073
Ain't no miracles left
in this world, Doctor.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.119
All a man needs...

03:15.240 --> 03:17.800
is something to live for.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.151
Fresh blooms for you, sir?

03:58.280 --> 04:01.079

- No, thank you.

no Sumners and no fishes. What...

Oi. Copper.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.599
What's afoot, then?

04:18.720 --> 04:20.677
I found him cowering
behind the meat wagons.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.354
Robin. What happened?

04:26.480 --> 04:27.675
Mr Thatcher.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.870

He looked like an animal.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.189
He...

04:42.320 --> 04:44.436
ate his throat.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.751
About your business now.

04:50.760 --> 04:51.989
I'll take care of the lad.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.429
Robin Sumner. Hey, look at me.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.631
You trust me, don't you?

04:58.760 --> 05:01.195
You come with me now.

That's the Sumner boy there.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.716
So, you saw it?
You saw the man Nathaniel?

05:14.840 --> 05:16.319
It's all right, Robin. They're friends.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.080
- Mr Reid, sir...
- You tell me, Robin. Where? Where?!

05:19.200 --> 05:21.669
- Will you tell me, boy? Where?
- Back off, Reid.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.394
Can't you tell that boy is shit-scared?

05:25.480 --> 05:27.551
It's all right, son. It's all right.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.512
You get the hell out of here,
for Christ's sake.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.392
Mr Reid, leave us, please.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.070
You just drink this up, little man.

Don't ask.

We're gonna fill your belly,
gonna get you cleaned up real good,

06:11.640 --> 06:13.677
and then I'm gonna see
if I've got a shirt

06:13.800 --> 06:16.314
that fits a strong young soldier.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.599
The boy is fed and watered, at least.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.996
I have left him in more capable hands.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.396
His terrors.
I should not have shouted at him.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.232
You, Miss Morton, may be
a stranger to fearful children.

06:37.360 --> 06:41.115
I, alas, ought to have
the benefit of experience.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.672
I would not know where to begin, Mr Reid.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.430
It is strange to see the Captain thus...

06:54.760 --> 06:58.594
...a man so given to degenerate
proclivities and carnal oblivion.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.631
To see him thus, how?

07:02.440 --> 07:04.670
I suppose...

07:04.800 --> 07:06.473
fatherly.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.510
He told us where it happened

07:10.640 --> 07:13.712
and, better than that,
where Nathaniel's holed up.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.078

07:21.200 --> 07:22.759
- Then we move fast.
- We can't just...

07:22.880 --> 07:24.200
Have we not waited here long enough

07:24.320 --> 07:26.118
for the merest thread to follow?
We know where he lives.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.709
We find him, we get to Dove.
We find the bodies, we get to Dove.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.035

Now, Frank, everyone in the market
saw you with him.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.549
What do you mean, he ran away?

07:52.680 --> 07:54.591
The boy was as jumpy
as a buggered fox, Drum.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.711
What rumpus now
with you two pansy-flaps?

his helmet for a dunce cap.

I do not expect to repeat
my questions, Drummond.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.956
I passed by Spitalfields, sir.

08:04.080 --> 08:04.990
All the talk is,

08:05.120 --> 08:08.078
a pair of fish sellers, usually
at market, were missing this day.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.555
Only their boy, see,
he turns up, full hysterics,

08:10.680 --> 08:12.637
says he seen his ma and uncle killed.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.036
He says the killer...he used his teeth.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.629
- Teeth?
- Ripped the neck out, as I heard.

08:17.760 --> 08:21.071
- Where this lad now?
- Where indeed, sir?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.271
Frank had him and Frank lost him.

08:23.400 --> 08:27.234
The boy was...
He made off before I could...

08:27.360 --> 08:29.431
Bested by a woe-struck nipper.

My apologies, Inspector.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.798
- Inspector, should I wire] Division?
- Why would you do that?

08:33.919 --> 08:36.514
The Sumners, the fish sellers,
that is, they wasn't Whitechapel.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.631
They lived Hackney way,j Division turf.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.592
They worked Whitechapel Market.

a different way.

All right, so, he does his housework,
rolls the bodies into the rug,

12:45.680 --> 12:48.433
puts them in the cart,
wheels it down to the water.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.756
And he dumps the Sumners in the river.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.359
He burns the cart...

12:53.560 --> 12:54.630
...covers his tracks.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.319
But he would have weighed the bodies.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.158
Already on it, Reid.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.718
My guess is
he probably weighed 'em down

13:03.840 --> 13:07.549
just enough to let the current take
them...all the way to the ocean.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.513

if we can recover them,

it's how to dump a body in the river.

not the River Lea.

heard them likewise.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.479
took to sharing with me your conjecture

15:26.600 --> 15:29.991
that the toothsome villain then
said to be Abel Croker, deceased,

15:30.120 --> 15:31.997
is neither Abel Croker nor deceased.

15:32.120 --> 15:37.035
The brother, she says.
The brother of Augustus Dove, she says.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.871
Miss Castello,

15:42.000 --> 15:43.911
she proved amenable...

15:44.920 --> 15:46.593
...give or take,

15:46.720 --> 15:48.950
to sharing her research, Ed,

15:49.080 --> 15:51.196

in my possession.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.113

16:04.560 --> 16:07.154
Then you know it's the goddamn truth.

16:08.440 --> 16:11.000
- We've seen that brother.
- His name is Nathaniel.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.909
Every killing ascribed
to Abel Croker, he performed.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.713
He tore apart Bennet Drake.

16:17.840 --> 16:22.118
Augustus Dove used Croker
to protect his brother,

16:22.240 --> 16:26.598
as he now uses you
to prevent me from exposing him.

16:27.640 --> 16:31.395
You are not appointed, Jedediah,
for your able policing,

16:31.520 --> 16:33.830
but because you are
so easily made marionette,

16:33.960 --> 16:37.032
dancing to your master's fingers.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.276
Augustus Dove will fall.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.518
I will serve justice on him
and his brother

16:42.640 --> 16:47.316
and I only tell you this so that
you might stay out of my way.

16:48.480 --> 16:52.997

for you is beyond limit...

Years ago, when the Captain told me
he was leaving me and choosing you,

18:22.120 --> 18:25.158
I told him he was choosing
his past over his future.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.837
But I was wrong.

I was so...

Last I was here,

20:28.760 --> 20:33.277

of Edmund Reid's hypothesising...

vis-à-vis

20:37.640 --> 20:42.032

20:42.160 --> 20:45.152
- And I told you I did not.
- So I recall.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.671
But you see, Mr Dove, now I do
know Edmund Reid's hypothesising,

20:48.800 --> 20:51.872
- because Edmund Reid told me.
- You...

20:52.960 --> 20:54.075
...you found Reid?

You're mistaken.
I have...I have no brother.

21:18.560 --> 21:22.872
There is this day a nipper
abroad in Whitechapel,

21:23.000 --> 21:26.470
bawling how his uncle
got his throat bit out.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.955

21:29.080 --> 21:33.836
and who should I find doing likewise
but Steady Ed and the American?

And with the luxury of a gun on me,
they thought to tell me plenty.

21:39.120 --> 21:43.318

in Miss Castello's files.

We, er...who imagined...

31:12.600 --> 31:14.511
...we saw off death...

31:15.880 --> 31:18.474
...but there was for us...

31:18.600 --> 31:21.069
no true resurrection.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.476
We are the ghouls.

31:26.040 --> 31:27.951
We...we're bound

31:28.080 --> 31:31.596
to the reeking purgatory
of these streets,

31:31.720 --> 31:34.951
more...more cursed than the dead,

31:35.080 --> 31:37.879
who at least know their peace.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.719
For with us,

31:41.840 --> 31:43.956
there lingers like...

31:44.080 --> 31:46.720
like a whore's perfume,

31:46.840 --> 31:49.070
the dream of life.

There...

31:55.520 --> 31:56.919

Forgive me. Forgive me, Miss Reid.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.470
My intention was not to...

32:23.880 --> 32:26.235
Dear girl.

32:26.360 --> 32:29.876
Your father will find his peace.
I will make sure of it.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.594
Before it is done...

32:33.960 --> 32:36.315
...take yourself from this place.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.071
What are you doing home so early?

33:00.120 --> 33:02.589
I saw Mr Shine on Princelet Street.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.757
He was behaving very strangely.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.871
Tilda, I, er...

33:07.920 --> 33:09.558
Could we sit?

33:14.400 --> 33:17.552
But the longer he's out there
on the run,

33:17.680 --> 33:20.069
he just makes things worse for himself.

33:20.200 --> 33:23.591
Maybe...if he turned himself in,

33:23.720 --> 33:25.358
or else we could find him,
bring him in,

33:25.480 --> 33:29.553
he would have a fair hearing,
a chance to present himself...

33:31.880 --> 33:33.757
...and, er...

33:34.800 --> 33:36.916
...and all you would need to do...

33:38.280 --> 33:40.351
...is light your candle.

33:40.480 --> 33:41.390
I cannot, Drum.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.796
But, Tilda...

33:44.880 --> 33:47.110
...I would not ask this of you,
except I...

33:47.240 --> 33:48.833

Forgive me.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.391
JACKSON: We're 30 yards from the bend.

34:17.520 --> 34:21.592
The flow should be at its slowest
on this side.

The Sumner man will be
the heavier of the two.

your advice, is all, Mr Dove.

from your direct superior?

35:10.320 --> 35:14.109
I'm not accusing you of
insubordination, Inspector Drummond.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.312
Reid's apprehension remains
the chief concern of H Division.

you must do to that end,

35:19.520 --> 35:21.955
you may be sure it is for the good,

of your future with Miss Reid,

the body was dropped.
