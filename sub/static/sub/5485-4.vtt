00:00.335 --> 00:03.157
LOVE: <i>Previously on
The Bastard Executioner...</i>

00:03.234 --> 00:05.068
<i>Leon Tell. He torments me.</i>

00:05.136 --> 00:07.304
Petra's cross hung
about his noble neck.

00:07.371 --> 00:09.205
(laughing)

00:09.273 --> 00:11.775
<i>Every glint of that sapphire</i>
<i>mocks my hesitation</i>

00:11.842 --> 00:13.276
to plunge a blade
into his heart!

00:13.344 --> 00:14.878
TORAN: <i> As I want to plunge</i>
<i>a blade into the man</i>

00:14.946 --> 00:16.913
<i>who slaughtered</i>
<i>my wife and son.</i>

00:16.981 --> 00:19.849
The Reeve must stay alive
until we all have our truth.

00:19.917 --> 00:22.185
Baroness, at this
very moment,

00:22.253 --> 00:25.255
our king is deciding the fate
of Ventrishire.

00:25.323 --> 00:27.290
I travel to Windsor
in two weeks' time.

00:27.358 --> 00:29.125
Summoned
by His Majesty

00:29.193 --> 00:31.861
<i>to receive guidance</i>
<i>on how we govern.</i>

00:31.929 --> 00:33.797
Why are you doing this?

00:33.864 --> 00:37.167
Our buried truths bind us.

00:37.234 --> 00:39.703
And your skills will serve me.

00:39.770 --> 00:42.172
(shouting, grunting)

00:44.442 --> 00:45.809
WILKIN:
<i>Our deep secret</i>

00:45.876 --> 00:47.444
can cut both ways.

00:47.511 --> 00:50.180
CORBETT:
<i>I could lose my position.</i>

00:50.247 --> 00:52.148
And you,

00:52.216 --> 00:55.685
your soldier, your new
wife and children--

00:55.753 --> 00:58.355
all of you will most certainly
lose your heads.

00:59.924 --> 01:02.292
I would venture to say
you are more skilled

01:02.360 --> 01:03.994
than my most honored knights.

01:04.061 --> 01:06.429
You are a mystery to me,
Master Gawain.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.435
As I am to myself, my lady.

01:18.409 --> 01:19.909
(Jessamy moans)

01:19.977 --> 01:21.945
Please...

01:22.013 --> 01:23.413
(gasping)

01:25.549 --> 01:26.449
Please...

01:32.857 --> 01:34.257
Oh, God...

01:35.626 --> 01:37.394
(gasps)

01:38.462 --> 01:40.397
(Pippa fusses)

01:48.239 --> 01:50.273
(cooing gently)

01:55.112 --> 01:57.013
Maddy...

02:00.184 --> 02:02.452
I'm here, little one.

02:05.523 --> 02:08.157
(Jessamy mutters
breathily)

02:08.225 --> 02:10.827
(men conversing indistinctly)

02:13.964 --> 02:15.031
MAN:
My lady.

02:19.437 --> 02:20.370
(horse splutters)

02:23.574 --> 02:25.809
- So this is what you do when I sleep.
- My lady.

02:25.876 --> 02:28.078
You should be resting.

02:30.514 --> 02:32.382
That's a bit rougher
than you're used to, Love.

02:32.450 --> 02:34.384
After six days of riding,

02:34.452 --> 02:36.386
dear Isabel,

02:36.454 --> 02:38.621
I feel a bit rough.

02:42.126 --> 02:43.159

MAN (in distance):
There!

03:02.212 --> 03:03.246
- Come on!
(quietly): - This way!

03:03.314 --> 03:04.714
Hyah!

03:04.782 --> 03:06.616
Go!

03:06.684 --> 03:08.017
Yah!

03:09.820 --> 03:11.020
This way, master.

03:19.296 --> 03:20.196
This way.

03:30.207 --> 03:31.607
No!

03:40.150 --> 03:42.085

Oh! Oh! Oh...!

04:41.278 --> 04:45.381
The Rosula holds no god.

04:45.449 --> 04:48.084
And the Seraphim hold too many.

06:57.449 --> 06:59.383
Why do you still love me?

07:01.953 --> 07:05.656
I promised I would always
protect you and I could not.

07:05.723 --> 07:09.259
Love that is true...

07:09.327 --> 07:12.729
holds no condition.

07:12.797 --> 07:15.499
It changes shape,

07:15.567 --> 07:17.501
filling the cracks

07:17.569 --> 07:20.170
in our heart
to stop it from breaking.

07:22.607 --> 07:25.876
Our love will exist always,

07:25.944 --> 07:29.346
through any trial
of time or circumstance.

07:29.414 --> 07:32.015
Yea.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.984
I feel that.

07:37.322 --> 07:40.958
And I am afraid I will never
find that love again.

07:42.227 --> 07:44.161
You already have.

07:56.374 --> 07:58.542
I didn't mean to stir you
affright, my love.

07:58.610 --> 08:01.245
Do not my kisses give comfort?

08:03.348 --> 08:06.050
The boy is fetching water

08:06.118 --> 08:08.886
and the baby sleeps
after a good suckling.

08:12.390 --> 08:13.757
(sighs)

08:18.363 --> 08:20.431
This is not natural.

08:20.499 --> 08:21.732
A husband and wife

08:21.800 --> 08:23.701
need to be close.

08:23.768 --> 08:27.171
God has put me in this place.

08:27.239 --> 08:30.508
With you.

08:30.575 --> 08:32.308
I will learn to be close.

08:32.376 --> 08:33.878
Learn...?!

08:33.945 --> 08:36.813
Have you not loved me always?

08:39.150 --> 08:41.485
(door bangs open,
Pippa begins crying)

08:41.553 --> 08:42.953
Boy!

08:43.020 --> 08:44.355
Sorry, Mother.

08:44.422 --> 08:46.323
It's all right, lad.

08:59.404 --> 09:00.738
Hey! Hey!

09:00.739 --> 09:02.559
_

09:02.574 --> 09:03.774
Hup! Hup!

09:34.573 --> 09:35.940
(rooster crowing)

09:36.007 --> 09:37.308
Another
morning venture?

09:37.375 --> 09:41.212
Just tending to the tasks
of our trade, chamberlain.

09:41.279 --> 09:43.414
And what task calls you
to the Far Caverns

09:43.481 --> 09:45.683
nearly every new day?

09:47.786 --> 09:49.386
You've had spies on our trail?

09:49.454 --> 09:50.955
No.

09:51.022 --> 09:53.390
Just... curious observers.

09:56.962 --> 09:58.562
LEON: - Chamberlain...
MAN: - Open the gate!

09:58.630 --> 10:00.497
...our honored guests
have arrived.

10:10.141 --> 10:11.208
Who is this puffed-up crag?

10:11.276 --> 10:13.410
WILKIN: - Don't know.
- It's Baron Pryce, Maddy.

10:13.478 --> 10:16.714
You did service
in Pryceshire, but last month.

10:16.781 --> 10:18.616
They gave you no fair wage.

10:18.683 --> 10:20.618
We left in haste
for this shire.

10:23.021 --> 10:24.989
If we left in haste,
perhaps an apology

10:25.056 --> 10:27.758
- is due to those we served.
- Well advised, Marshal.

10:27.826 --> 10:29.760
Any of Pryce's nobles
on this ride

10:29.828 --> 10:31.762
we may have encountered
before, good wife?

10:31.830 --> 10:34.198
I believe only the chamberlain--

10:34.266 --> 10:37.301
he was there when you
were unjustly paid.

10:43.808 --> 10:46.010
Welcome to Castle Ventris,
good Baron.

10:46.077 --> 10:48.112
You are an honored
and welcomed guest.

10:48.179 --> 10:50.681
Do not waste your honey
on me, Corbett.

10:50.749 --> 10:52.016
Where's the baroness?

10:52.083 --> 10:55.052
Regretfully on her
way to Windsor.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.121
The king demanded
an audience.

10:57.188 --> 11:00.758
What? She's not here?
She's the one who pleaded

11:00.825 --> 11:02.726
- for this visit.
- Baron Pryce

11:02.794 --> 11:05.629
has traveled two long days
on the back of a hard steed,

11:05.697 --> 11:07.965
leaving the side
of his ailing wife.

11:08.033 --> 11:10.968
Lady Love is deeply contrite

11:11.036 --> 11:13.971
but, as you know,
when His Majesty calls, all...

11:14.039 --> 11:17.007
must answer.
She left but yesterday.

11:17.075 --> 11:18.976
Then why did you
not dispatch a messenger?

11:19.044 --> 11:20.444
Simple arithmetic,

11:20.512 --> 11:21.745
Sir Dyer.

11:21.813 --> 11:23.180
A messenger sent yesterday

11:23.248 --> 11:24.948
would have met you
beyond the midway

11:25.016 --> 11:27.818
of our shires.
I thought it most wise

11:27.886 --> 11:30.087
to have you
complete your journey.

11:30.155 --> 11:31.889
Allow your
caravan to rest.

11:31.956 --> 11:34.224
If you were indeed,
most wise, Sir Corbett,

11:34.292 --> 11:36.093
your baron would be here
in flesh,

11:36.161 --> 11:38.862
and not but a stone effigy
at your bridge.

11:38.930 --> 11:41.131
It seems we have
little choice

11:41.199 --> 11:43.133
but to stay the night.

11:56.014 --> 11:59.172
The baroness left
nearly a week ago.

12:01.786 --> 12:04.621
An observation which
serves no purpose.

12:07.058 --> 12:10.227
We need to make a full day
of our ride to the Sea Caves.

12:10.495 --> 12:14.031
We cannot risk this noble
finding another face on Maddox.

12:14.098 --> 12:16.934
What of Corbett
and his observers?

12:17.001 --> 12:18.502
There will be no journey
today, Maddox.

12:18.570 --> 12:19.970
Our chamberlain
has planned a tournament

12:20.038 --> 12:21.605
for the nobles of Pryceshire.

12:21.673 --> 12:25.075
He wants his able punisher
in the fray.

12:25.143 --> 12:27.044
You as well, Marshal.

12:33.618 --> 12:35.519
(doors creak open)

12:36.820 --> 12:39.422
_

13:02.547 --> 13:03.914
MAN:
Welcome!

13:03.982 --> 13:06.083
(man laughs)

13:06.150 --> 13:08.318
Welcome!

13:08.386 --> 13:09.820
Is this...

13:09.887 --> 13:12.956
Lady Love Ventris?

13:13.024 --> 13:14.858
Huh? If so,

13:14.926 --> 13:18.195
then God truly is
a gifted gardener,

13:18.262 --> 13:21.031
for he has planted
the finest flower of Wales

13:21.099 --> 13:23.066
at Windsor Castle today.

13:23.134 --> 13:25.335
LADY LOVE:
Thank you, sir.

13:25.403 --> 13:27.270
I am Lady Love Ventris.

13:27.338 --> 13:29.373
And by your charm
and pleasant visage,

13:29.440 --> 13:32.809
I must assume you are
the honored Earl of Cornwall.

13:32.877 --> 13:34.611
My manners.

13:34.679 --> 13:37.748
Forgive me, but it seems
your radiant beauty

13:37.815 --> 13:39.850
has robbed me of courtly reason.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.719
Piers Gaveston.

13:42.787 --> 13:46.356
Trusted advisor to His Majesty,
King Edward the Second.

13:46.424 --> 13:48.825
Thank you, Sir Gaveston.

13:48.893 --> 13:51.728
Your flattery puts me at ease.

13:51.796 --> 13:54.631
But I do hope
your reason returns.

13:54.699 --> 13:57.434
We have so much more
than beauty to discuss.

14:01.005 --> 14:03.874
Indeed, Baroness.

14:03.941 --> 14:07.611
The king has requested that you
join him for his midday meal.

14:07.679 --> 14:10.681
He is most eager to discuss
the future of Ventrishire.

14:10.748 --> 14:13.717
How soon can you be...

14:13.785 --> 14:16.119
presentable?

14:19.190 --> 14:22.225
We have had a very long journey.

14:22.293 --> 14:25.262
- Perhaps some time to refresh.
- Of course.

14:25.329 --> 14:28.298
Servants will show you
to your quarters.

14:28.366 --> 14:32.235
I will see to fitting you
with a proper gown.

14:32.303 --> 14:35.305
I serve at the king's pleasure.

14:44.415 --> 14:46.349
(quietly):
"Presentable"?

14:46.417 --> 14:49.619
You wear your finest, my lady.
That man shows you no--

14:49.687 --> 14:51.388
That man is the voice
in the king's ear,

14:51.456 --> 14:54.925
with influence to sway Edward in
the direction that he chooses.

14:56.894 --> 14:58.428
Come...

14:58.496 --> 15:02.432
let us see if we might transform
me into something more...

15:02.500 --> 15:04.034
presentable.

15:10.769 --> 15:14.200
_

15:25.890 --> 15:27.457
What is it?

15:27.525 --> 15:30.427
I do not think
Wilkin will make the ride today.

15:30.495 --> 15:32.696
It is best you leave here.

15:32.764 --> 15:34.364
Make camp
along the coast.

15:34.432 --> 15:36.099
CALO:
Why?

15:36.167 --> 15:38.235
What fate lands here?

15:38.302 --> 15:40.203
Please.

15:40.271 --> 15:43.306
Trust my warning.

15:45.743 --> 15:47.644
I never seen her
like that before.

15:49.714 --> 15:52.315
What will happen,
healer?

15:52.383 --> 15:54.317
I do not know.

15:54.385 --> 15:57.320
I sense trouble.

15:58.422 --> 16:00.590
This sense,

16:00.658 --> 16:02.793
do you see things
that might happen?

16:02.860 --> 16:04.594
I feel them.

16:04.662 --> 16:06.763
Through the people they touch.

16:06.831 --> 16:08.331
BERBER:
Where is your mate?

16:08.399 --> 16:10.333
ANNORA: He's in the
Western Coves.

16:10.401 --> 16:12.903
He gathers red
coral for my cures.

16:12.970 --> 16:15.338
You are frightened.

16:15.406 --> 16:17.207
Yes.

16:17.275 --> 16:20.076
But more for others
than for myself.

16:20.144 --> 16:22.479
If Wilkin doesn't come,
the burden of your safety

16:22.547 --> 16:24.281
falls to his friends.

16:24.348 --> 16:28.051
That is as kind as it is unwise.

16:28.119 --> 16:30.554
BERBER:
Perhaps.

16:30.621 --> 16:32.956
But that is how it will be.

16:34.091 --> 16:37.160
Thank you, good Moor.

16:46.165 --> 16:48.967
(sighs)

16:50.903 --> 16:52.670
If you'd told me, when
I was a girl, that one day

16:52.738 --> 16:54.172
I would be a
guest of the king,

16:54.239 --> 16:56.941
my heart would have been
bursting with joy.

16:57.009 --> 16:59.077
- It is thrilling.
- It should be.

16:59.144 --> 17:01.479
But I feel no thrill,
just dread.

17:01.547 --> 17:05.650
So much depends upon the outcome
of this meet.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.989
Perhaps it was unwise
to not bring counsel.

17:16.595 --> 17:19.998
Do you remember
the Boar of Black Oak?

17:21.532 --> 17:23.434
Lord Cradoc's son, Morgan.

17:25.471 --> 17:28.306
Yes, a portly,
harsh-looking boy.

17:28.374 --> 17:30.208
Tiny eyes.

17:30.275 --> 17:32.176
Who did not look favorably
upon the daughter

17:32.244 --> 17:34.946
of a Welsh lord befriending
the daughter of a house servant.

17:35.014 --> 17:37.148
No, he did not.

17:37.216 --> 17:39.851
There was a day Morgan decided

17:39.918 --> 17:42.020
to show me my proper place.

17:42.087 --> 17:44.055
Yes.

17:44.123 --> 17:46.624
We were playing, and he chased
you into the stables,

17:46.692 --> 17:48.292
pinned you to the ground.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.661
He was chastising you.

17:49.728 --> 17:51.462
And as he raised a hand
to strike me,

17:51.530 --> 17:55.533
suddenly he yelped like a dog,
then fell to the dirt.

17:55.601 --> 17:57.935
And there you were,

17:58.003 --> 18:01.172
shovel in hand,
the lioness of Wales.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.207
Afraid of no one.

18:03.275 --> 18:06.144
Secure of heart.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.115
I'm afraid there is no comparing
the boars of our childhood

18:11.183 --> 18:14.952
with the royal beasts
we presently face.

18:15.020 --> 18:18.890
You'll handle this situation
as you do all others.

18:18.957 --> 18:20.958
With grace and strength.

18:23.429 --> 18:25.463
Whatever happened
to Morgan the Boar?

18:25.531 --> 18:27.131
Very sad.

18:27.199 --> 18:29.534
While traveling home one night,
he was devoured by wolves,

18:29.601 --> 18:31.903
who mistook him
for a fat, two-legged hog.

18:31.970 --> 18:34.172
That is horrible.

18:36.075 --> 18:39.277
And a story you just invented.

18:39.344 --> 18:41.813
(chuckles)

18:45.150 --> 18:46.350
Pardon, Chamberlain.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.653
A report somewhat disturbing,
I'm afraid.

18:48.721 --> 18:51.355
- What now?
- Foot soldiers discovered a body

18:51.423 --> 18:53.591
along the south court trail
this morning.

18:53.659 --> 18:56.461
Limbs severed, body carved
with devil symbols.

18:56.528 --> 18:57.495
A sacrifice

18:57.563 --> 18:59.063
- of some kind.
- Shit.

18:59.131 --> 19:00.331
I've seen the remains.

19:00.399 --> 19:01.466
It was murder.

19:01.533 --> 19:03.568
By a hideous hand.

19:05.938 --> 19:08.206
Be certain that your men say
nothing of this crime.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.308
I do not want
Baron Pryce thinking

19:10.375 --> 19:12.110
that Satan dances at our gate.

19:19.752 --> 19:22.286
Shouldn't you be preparing
for the contest, Maddox,

19:22.354 --> 19:24.989
impressing Pryceshire
with your earthy swagger?

19:25.057 --> 19:26.958
That would be unwise.
For Maddox.

19:27.025 --> 19:29.927
My beloved wife has reminded me
that I was in Pryceshire

19:29.995 --> 19:31.429
before coming here.

19:31.497 --> 19:33.131
In service to their chamberlain.

19:33.198 --> 19:35.399
(wry chuckle)

19:35.467 --> 19:36.934
- Dyer?
- Mm.

19:37.002 --> 19:39.504
Anyone else who would have
known the face of Maddox?

19:39.571 --> 19:40.938
Not in this caravan.

19:41.006 --> 19:42.273
Good.

19:42.341 --> 19:45.076
Do not concern yourself
with Sir Dyer.

19:45.144 --> 19:48.346
He plants himself so deeply
inside his baron's ass,

19:48.413 --> 19:51.048
he has no vision
beyond those bony cheeks.

19:52.818 --> 19:55.720
And if he realizes
I'm not Gawain Maddox?

19:55.788 --> 19:58.523
The Pryceshire chamberlain
will not disrupt

19:58.590 --> 20:00.525
your happy, new life.

20:00.592 --> 20:02.293
You have my word.

20:02.361 --> 20:05.129
As much comfort as your word
gives me, Chamberlain,

20:05.230 --> 20:07.317
do not forget,

20:07.385 --> 20:10.520
you've as much delusion
as I do.

20:14.992 --> 20:15.892
(man screaming)

20:20.464 --> 20:21.364
(groaning in agony)

20:22.434 --> 20:24.434
_

20:24.435 --> 20:28.271
There is no need for all
this suffering, Tobias.

20:30.708 --> 20:32.175
We only want to find
the other Seraphim,

20:32.243 --> 20:34.945
so that we may help translate

20:35.012 --> 20:37.514
the sacred text you all wear.

20:38.616 --> 20:40.583
There's nothing more

20:40.651 --> 20:42.118
you can take from me...

20:42.186 --> 20:44.454
Robinus.

20:48.326 --> 20:51.995
I have no more.

20:52.063 --> 20:54.130
- (knocking on door)
ROBINUS: <i> - Attendez.</i>

21:02.306 --> 21:04.140
You've been summoned
above, master.

21:04.208 --> 21:08.511
A demand for more
meaningless counsel, I am sure.

21:08.579 --> 21:12.349
Thank you, Sir Cormac.

21:12.416 --> 21:14.718
Has this one come
forth with anything?

21:14.785 --> 21:16.953
He has not.

21:17.021 --> 21:19.322
Continue the work, my son.

21:19.390 --> 21:20.690
Yes, master.

21:26.030 --> 21:27.597
Take the eye.

21:31.569 --> 21:33.636
(screaming)

21:33.704 --> 21:35.538
(screaming continues
in distance)

22:07.038 --> 22:08.671
GAVESTON:
Ah, you have a gift

22:08.739 --> 22:10.373
of divine timing,
good Father.

22:10.441 --> 22:12.509
His Majesty requests counsel.

22:12.576 --> 22:14.077
I am here.

22:14.145 --> 22:16.279
At the king's beckoning.

22:16.347 --> 22:17.480
As I am yours.

22:17.548 --> 22:19.716
Ah, Lady Ventris.

22:22.019 --> 22:24.421
May I introduce
His Holiness,

22:24.488 --> 22:26.589
the Archdeacon of Windsor.

22:26.657 --> 22:28.558
The Baroness
from Wales.

22:28.626 --> 22:31.995
My deepest condolences,
my child.

22:32.063 --> 22:33.363
Thank you, Archdeacon.

22:33.431 --> 22:34.998
It is an honor to meet a man

22:35.066 --> 22:36.433
of such holy prestige.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.269
I am but a humble
cleric, my lady.

22:39.336 --> 22:42.539
Serving God is
my only prestige.

22:42.606 --> 22:46.009
Take the baroness and her maiden
to the king's day chamber.

22:46.077 --> 22:49.212
You may wait there
for His Majesty.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.114
May I ask a question,
Sir Gaveston?

22:51.182 --> 22:52.382
Oh, no.

22:52.450 --> 22:55.785
Do not worry, Baroness.

22:55.853 --> 22:57.720
The dress looks vely.

22:57.788 --> 22:59.722
The king will be pleased.

22:59.790 --> 23:01.958
He loves golden things.

23:05.963 --> 23:09.466
Find me a shovel.

23:18.175 --> 23:21.878
Is this why

23:21.946 --> 23:23.813
the baroness
needed to meet?

23:23.881 --> 23:25.782
To have me review
her ledgers?

23:25.850 --> 23:27.484
Of course not.

23:27.551 --> 23:30.753
But I thought your time here
might be put to good purpose.

23:32.356 --> 23:34.724
Allow you to gain
knowledge of our shire.

23:34.792 --> 23:37.060
It does not take much knowledge
to see that Ventrishire

23:37.128 --> 23:39.496
has more debt than
it does resources.

23:39.563 --> 23:41.631
Only if one looks
at the present limitations.

23:43.167 --> 23:46.469
With men and resources,

23:46.537 --> 23:49.072
we could clear the rugged beach
and build a port.

23:49.140 --> 23:50.607
that allows larger

23:50.674 --> 23:53.977
seafaring vessels.

23:54.044 --> 23:55.778
It would make

23:55.846 --> 23:58.014
Ventrishire the center
of all imports

23:58.082 --> 23:59.782
and exports west of the marsh.

23:59.850 --> 24:03.186
The shire would earn a tariff

24:03.254 --> 24:05.021
on all goods
coming and going.

24:05.089 --> 24:07.290
That is a decision
for the king.

24:07.358 --> 24:09.125
Perhaps.

24:09.193 --> 24:10.660
But I know, dear Baron,

24:10.728 --> 24:13.796
that before Longshanks
divided Pryceshire

24:13.864 --> 24:16.199
and gave this coastal half

24:16.267 --> 24:18.001
to his favorite constable,
that you, indeed,

24:18.068 --> 24:21.571
had similar plans
for such a port.

24:21.639 --> 24:23.039
Is there a reason
why you torment me

24:23.107 --> 24:25.008
will this ill-fated history?

24:25.075 --> 24:28.444
Even if His Majesty
allows the baroness

24:28.512 --> 24:30.480
to remain in power,
we do not have the resources

24:30.548 --> 24:33.082
to build anything.

24:33.150 --> 24:36.920
You, however,
have wealth to spare.

24:36.987 --> 24:38.922
After all these years
of abusive taxation

24:38.989 --> 24:41.124
from your now deceased baron,

24:41.192 --> 24:45.595
why should I lend the shire
even half a shilling?

24:45.663 --> 24:46.896
Oh, there would be
no lending, sir.

24:49.233 --> 24:50.867
Because the shire
would be yours.

25:03.380 --> 25:04.881
Lady Love

25:04.949 --> 25:06.516
is a widow...

25:06.584 --> 25:10.119
and her rule is in the hands
of a frivolous king.

25:10.187 --> 25:13.890
There are only two things that
would trump such a decision--

25:13.958 --> 25:17.527
an heir of Ventris...

25:17.595 --> 25:20.830
Or marriage to an
appointed noble.

25:26.237 --> 25:28.037
You are quite aware
that I'm already married.

25:28.105 --> 25:29.105
Yes.

25:29.173 --> 25:31.341
And forgive my boldness, Baron,

25:31.408 --> 25:34.077
but I am told that
the Lady Trula's consumption

25:34.144 --> 25:35.778
grows beyond the prospect

25:35.846 --> 25:38.448
of a return to wellness.

25:38.515 --> 25:41.050
You are indeed bold,
Chamberlain.

25:41.118 --> 25:42.652
Yes, eh,
I'm sorry, Baron.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.454
I mean no disrespect.

25:44.521 --> 25:47.690
Sometimes my love
of a brighter future

25:47.758 --> 25:50.493
clouds my reason.

25:50.561 --> 25:53.830
I am, I confess,
a bit of a dreamer.

25:53.897 --> 25:55.565
In this dream,

25:55.633 --> 25:57.634
I presume you would
be my chamberlain.

25:59.870 --> 26:01.838
I believe that would
serve you best.

26:01.905 --> 26:03.673
And your baroness--

26:03.741 --> 26:06.476
is she open to such
an arrangement?

26:06.543 --> 26:08.578
Lady Love would do anything

26:08.646 --> 26:11.214
to hold on
to her beloved land.

26:11.282 --> 26:13.683
Although your good looks
and charms

26:13.751 --> 26:16.452
would be enough
to sway any woman.

26:16.520 --> 26:19.455
You've given this
much thought, Corbett.

26:19.523 --> 26:20.990
Perhaps too much.

26:21.058 --> 26:22.659
Well, give
thought to this.

26:22.726 --> 26:24.727
I foresee two obstacles.

26:24.795 --> 26:26.329
My chamberlain, Sir Dyer,

26:26.397 --> 26:28.264
his family has influence
with the king.

26:28.332 --> 26:30.099
Losing his position
would wound

26:30.167 --> 26:31.334
his pride and
prestige.

26:31.402 --> 26:32.735
Indeed.

26:32.803 --> 26:33.770
And the other?

26:33.837 --> 26:35.638
The other?

26:35.706 --> 26:38.408
The other is God's will.

26:38.475 --> 26:42.078
He may well see fit to return
my wife to good health.

26:42.146 --> 26:44.781
Of course.
One could only hope.

26:44.848 --> 26:46.749
I will give both

26:46.817 --> 26:49.585
deep thought.

27:18.665 --> 27:20.866
We've been here nearly
two hours, my lady.

27:20.934 --> 27:22.668
You must be starving.

27:22.736 --> 27:25.047
I'm fine.

27:25.115 --> 27:28.818
A well awr never eats before the king.

27:28.885 --> 27:30.886
Well, the king may have

27:30.954 --> 27:32.455
to step over our
ghostly bodies,

27:32.522 --> 27:34.824
for we will surely
faint with hunger.

27:41.164 --> 27:43.299
Perhaps just a plum
or a crust...

27:43.366 --> 27:45.301
Sit down, maiden.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.146
I don't like the French.

27:57.214 --> 28:00.049
The French will survive
without your support.

28:24.674 --> 28:26.809
Book of Exodus.

28:26.877 --> 28:28.177
One of my favorites.

28:33.383 --> 28:35.184
I like Bible stories.

28:35.252 --> 28:36.719
Can you read any of it?

28:36.787 --> 28:38.154
No, sir.

28:38.221 --> 28:39.388
I'm too dull-minded.

28:41.024 --> 28:42.358
Who told you that?

28:42.425 --> 28:43.492
My father.

28:47.764 --> 28:50.032
I'm-I'm sorry.

28:53.537 --> 28:55.938
It's all right
to speak the truth.

28:56.006 --> 28:58.240
- But my mother...
- Is afraid.

28:58.308 --> 28:59.909
Yes.

29:02.813 --> 29:05.147
Your father...

29:05.215 --> 29:07.483
he hurt you and
your mother, didn't he?

29:09.052 --> 29:10.586
When we deserved it.

29:12.722 --> 29:16.025
No innocent deserves
to be hurt, Luca.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.930
And you're not dull of mind.

29:20.997 --> 29:24.200
You're one of the
brightest boys I've met.

29:25.869 --> 29:27.870
I have a deal to offer.

29:27.938 --> 29:30.272
I'll teach you how to read

29:30.340 --> 29:33.209
if you help me
with your mother's worry.

29:34.544 --> 29:36.579
May I still
call you father?

29:42.953 --> 29:46.222
Of course.

30:00.070 --> 30:01.937
Moor! Moor!

30:02.005 --> 30:05.074
It's Calo.

30:06.843 --> 30:09.245
Where is he going?

30:09.312 --> 30:12.214
He wouldn't say.

30:12.282 --> 30:14.316
Hey.

30:14.384 --> 30:15.818
I'm taking the healer's warning.

30:15.886 --> 30:17.386
I promised her
we would stay.

30:17.454 --> 30:19.054
We've been here for
nearly two months,

30:19.122 --> 30:21.724
and we are no closer
to avenging our families.

30:21.791 --> 30:23.659
- It's time to go.
ASH: - Go where?

30:23.727 --> 30:25.160
It doesn't matter.

30:25.228 --> 30:27.730
Waiting here will
bring a worse fate.

30:27.797 --> 30:30.132
What would your brother do?

30:32.202 --> 30:33.636
Aron would stay.

30:33.703 --> 30:36.038
Aron is dead.

30:36.106 --> 30:38.641
Because of me.

30:38.708 --> 30:40.309
That is not true.

30:47.684 --> 30:49.151
Then you should go.

30:49.219 --> 30:51.053
- What of Wilk and Toran?
- They won't protest.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.723
They understand
the plight of boys.

30:56.092 --> 30:57.293
I am not a boy.

30:57.360 --> 31:01.363
Boys run from the things
they are afraid of.

31:03.133 --> 31:05.200
- And you're not afraid, Moor?
- All the time.

31:05.268 --> 31:08.704
But I look at my fear...

31:08.772 --> 31:12.007
and I pray to find
some small piece of bravery

31:12.075 --> 31:14.677
to face it.

31:17.580 --> 31:19.915
Travel safe, my friend.

31:27.123 --> 31:29.391
(groaning, gasping)

31:31.428 --> 31:34.830
(yells, panting)

31:34.898 --> 31:37.566
(door opening)

31:37.634 --> 31:39.535
He gives nothing.
It's the same

31:39.602 --> 31:41.003
as the other three, master.

31:41.071 --> 31:42.771
And the scroll
he was carrying?

31:42.839 --> 31:45.474
Well, the text is
of similar Aramaic origin,

31:45.542 --> 31:47.242
but the symbols that alter it--

31:47.310 --> 31:48.911
they're different
from the other three.

31:50.513 --> 31:54.049
So that nothing learnt from one
can be used to decipher another.

31:54.117 --> 31:56.552
Yes. The code is well-conceived.

31:56.619 --> 31:58.887
(Tobias whimpers and groans)

32:00.256 --> 32:04.526
This was some kind of message.

32:04.594 --> 32:06.929
A warning, perhaps,
to another Seraphim.

32:08.465 --> 32:09.865
We found Tobias at the port,

32:09.933 --> 32:11.834
near western-bound vessels.

32:11.901 --> 32:14.303
They wend the river
and channel to the Irish Sea.

32:16.039 --> 32:17.573
Go to the king's map room.

32:17.640 --> 32:19.842
Consider what we have learnt,

32:19.909 --> 32:23.312
and make sound judgment
of where he was to journey.

32:23.380 --> 32:24.780
Yes, master.

32:24.848 --> 32:25.948
And what of Tobias?

32:26.016 --> 32:27.983
The fate of the others.

32:31.888 --> 32:34.823
<i>Fin de l'hérésie.</i>

32:34.891 --> 32:37.226

32:39.295 --> 32:41.130

32:42.198 --> 32:43.899

32:45.468 --> 32:46.902

32:46.970 --> 32:48.604
(Tobias screams, sobs)

33:04.854 --> 33:06.355
(footsteps approaching)

33:19.402 --> 33:21.570
I beg your pardon...

33:23.106 --> 33:25.307
but my lady wants to be
certain that she is waiting

33:25.375 --> 33:27.776
in the right chamber
to meet the king.

33:32.849 --> 33:33.982
LADY LOVE:
Unlike

33:34.050 --> 33:35.818
my maiden,
the king's servants know not

33:35.885 --> 33:37.719
to speak of things
beyond their status.

33:37.787 --> 33:40.823
I am sorry, Baroness.

33:40.890 --> 33:43.826
I am so lost here.

33:43.893 --> 33:46.228
I don't know how to help.

33:55.638 --> 33:58.006
Oh, bollocks.

33:58.074 --> 34:00.476
My lady.

34:00.543 --> 34:03.145
I'm sure our generous king will
not mind sharing a few scraps

34:03.213 --> 34:05.013
with his misbegotten
Welsh children.

34:12.355 --> 34:13.889
Stop smiling.

groaning, laughter)

A warrior's dressing hangs
well on you, Maddox.

34:57.499 --> 34:59.834
It's as if you were
born to wear it.

34:59.902 --> 35:01.636
WILKIN:
We both may be wearing rags

35:01.704 --> 35:04.072

Do not concern yourself.

35:05.975 --> 35:07.575
I promise you no utterance

35:07.643 --> 35:11.412

I must confess,

An executioner.

safe passage to Scotland,

43:45.977 --> 43:49.980
and that the castle I grew up in
would be given to an heir.

43:53.584 --> 43:57.421
I am moved by your
devotion, dear Love.

44:00.191 --> 44:04.161
But the only agreements
that matter...

44:04.228 --> 44:07.063
are the ones
you make now.

44:10.802 --> 44:12.769
I will let you get back

44:12.837 --> 44:15.705
to your more considerable
matters, Sir Gaveston.

44:17.809 --> 44:21.144
And this little golden beetle

44:21.212 --> 44:24.448
will crawl back
to her marshland dung heap.

44:39.564 --> 44:41.298
(door clanks open)

44:48.973 --> 44:51.007
This is not Gawain Maddox.

44:51.075 --> 44:53.009
The punisher with the same name

44:53.077 --> 44:56.379
had a similar scar,
but he was slighter in stature.

44:58.649 --> 45:00.584
I so appreciate you keeping

45:00.651 --> 45:03.587
your suspicions
to yourself, Sir Dyer.

45:03.654 --> 45:05.956
Now that all doubt
had been lifted,

45:06.023 --> 45:07.624
Baron Pryce will be informed.

45:11.496 --> 45:13.129
Have you gone mad?

45:13.197 --> 45:15.398
I promised you he wouldn't utter
a word of your secret,

45:15.466 --> 45:17.100
and now you will
make sure of it.

45:17.168 --> 45:18.502
Make sure of what?

45:18.569 --> 45:21.471
That he never utters.

45:21.539 --> 45:24.307
Kill him.

45:24.375 --> 45:25.709
I will not.

45:25.776 --> 45:27.143
This is your poison.

45:27.211 --> 45:29.513
No, Brattle, this is
our mother's milk.

45:29.580 --> 45:32.449
This is what we are,
what we know.

45:35.086 --> 45:37.420
I'm not a man who does this.

45:37.488 --> 45:39.256
(scoffs)

45:51.802 --> 45:55.639
CORBETT: They have been taken
into the custody of manor law,

45:55.706 --> 45:58.441
under the suspicion
of a brutal satanic murder.

46:00.144 --> 46:02.512
They've done no crime.

46:15.393 --> 46:18.929
Everyone you love
or care about

46:18.996 --> 46:21.898
is either dead or within
my grasp to make that so.

46:23.768 --> 46:26.469
He is a pompous
annoyance.

46:28.372 --> 46:31.107
God will cheer when he
drops down to hell.

46:31.175 --> 46:34.611
Give it a natural twist.

46:34.679 --> 46:37.080
Drunk, hit his head,
something simple.

46:39.350 --> 46:42.185
And I will make
sure that his death

46:42.253 --> 46:44.921
is found to be an
unfortunate accident.

47:09.280 --> 47:10.947
(sighs)

47:11.015 --> 47:12.949
(shudders, gasps)

47:15.686 --> 47:17.187
Corbett...

47:20.858 --> 47:24.094
and you,

47:24.161 --> 47:28.164
you cast your eyes on
the words of the Lord.

47:28.232 --> 47:32.202
Your soul is as false
as your name.

47:46.851 --> 47:48.284
(grunting)

47:52.390 --> 47:54.290
(Dyer gagging)

47:58.796 --> 48:00.463
(gagging)

48:11.942 --> 48:13.009
(sighs deeply)

48:19.853 --> 48:21.753
(knocking on door)

48:26.326 --> 48:29.161
I see you are prepared
for your journey.

48:32.432 --> 48:34.166
I wished to do this
over a morning meal,

48:34.234 --> 48:37.135
but as you appear
to be in haste...

48:39.672 --> 48:42.174
I have taken counsel
with the king's chancellor.

48:42.242 --> 48:45.143
He will draft a
decree of division.

48:47.280 --> 48:50.249
Ventrishire will be
divided into thirds.

48:50.316 --> 48:54.219
Two territories going to
the neighboring shires...

48:54.287 --> 48:56.688
and the third--
(chuckles)

48:56.756 --> 49:00.025
the coastal area
with the castle--

49:00.093 --> 49:02.361
will fall to my authority.

49:07.600 --> 49:10.636
And that decision is final?

49:10.703 --> 49:13.005
(wry chuckle)
Indeed, Baroness.

49:13.072 --> 49:16.008
It is most final.

49:16.075 --> 49:17.876
Have a safe journey.

49:17.944 --> 49:20.646
And, please,
keep the gown as our gift

49:20.713 --> 49:23.315
for your loyalty and patience.

49:26.819 --> 49:29.688
I'm afraid the gown will
soon be of no use.

49:29.756 --> 49:33.025
Nor will the decree
of division.

49:33.092 --> 49:34.993
I am with heir.

49:36.429 --> 49:40.132
Blessed gift from
my departed husband.

49:40.199 --> 49:43.502
That was the news I wished
to share with the king.

49:45.972 --> 49:49.875
Thank you for your hospitality,
Sir Gaveston.

49:49.943 --> 49:52.210
You may send your servants
for our things.

49:56.816 --> 49:58.317
<i>Au revoir.</i>

50:03.456 --> 50:04.723
LADY LOVE (distant):
Isabel!

50:04.791 --> 50:07.025
What? Oh, yes.

50:09.128 --> 50:10.395
<i>Au revoir.</i>

50:16.269 --> 50:20.672
Your baroness never requested
a visit, did she?

50:20.740 --> 50:24.676
A deception, good Baron,
compelled by my divine sense

50:24.744 --> 50:28.447
that our shires deserve the
fruits of a greater tree.

50:28.514 --> 50:31.917
It seems Sir Dyer's tree bore
fruit a bit more deadly.

50:31.985 --> 50:34.486
CORBETT:
Yes.

50:34.554 --> 50:36.888
A sad and fainthearted
way to die.

50:36.956 --> 50:38.256
Fowl bones.

50:42.795 --> 50:44.563
You're an impressive man,
Corbett.

50:44.630 --> 50:48.934
And yet my admiration is matched
by an equal part of caution.

50:50.470 --> 50:52.371
Embrace the former,
good Baron.

51:01.848 --> 51:03.382
You will hear from me soon.

51:18.431 --> 51:20.298
ASH:
No!

51:20.366 --> 51:22.100
No!

51:22.168 --> 51:23.435
No, no, please!

51:23.503 --> 51:25.070
Please, no! No!

51:25.138 --> 51:26.471
- Please...!
- Get down!

51:26.539 --> 51:29.041
(echoing):
Please, no, come back!

51:31.444 --> 51:34.346
(Berber screams in agony)

51:43.823 --> 51:44.756
(groans, gasps)

51:51.364 --> 51:52.197
SOLDIER:
Lock it!

51:52.265 --> 51:53.565
(keys rattling)

52:21.227 --> 52:22.527
Master.

52:26.399 --> 52:28.400
I've consulted the
maps and tide charts.

52:30.970 --> 52:32.404
One of these
ports or shires

52:32.472 --> 52:34.039
would've been
Seraphim's destination.

52:39.912 --> 52:41.746
♪ ♪

53:06.239 --> 53:08.140
♪ ♪

53:08.207 --> 53:10.108

53:22.488 --> 53:23.421
Jessamy!

53:23.489 --> 53:24.389
(gasps)

53:29.629 --> 53:31.329
Why would you do this?

53:33.633 --> 53:35.400
I don't, Maddy.

53:35.468 --> 53:36.868
You do.

53:36.936 --> 53:40.605
As you have always done
when we need correction.

53:47.146 --> 53:49.114
(sniffling, crying quietly)

53:53.719 --> 53:56.054
It's all right, son.

53:58.157 --> 54:00.458
I'm here.

54:03.496 --> 54:04.796
(sighs deeply)

54:04.864 --> 54:06.431
I'm here.
