17:55.750 --> 17:56.917
MAYBE A LITTLE SNATCH AND GRAB.

17:56.917 --> 17:57.834
WHAT DO THEY CALL THAT?
RENDITIONING?

THEY USUALLY DO.

18:37.709 --> 18:40.750
(Debra)
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE HE'S NOT OUR GUY.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.250
WELL, YOU SHOULD TRUST
YOUR INSTINCTS ON THIS ONE.

18:43.250 --> 18:46.458
THIS ONE

18:48.125 --> 18:49.625
FUCKING TELL ME.

18:49.625 --> 18:53.750
HE'S HELD
LIFE AND DEATH IN HIS HANDS.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.041
HE LIKES IT.

18:55.041 --> 18:58.083
I KNEW IT.

18:58.083 --> 19:00.625
SO HOW DO I CRACK
THIS SICK FUCK'S BRAIN?

19:00.625 --> 19:02.083
[snorts]

19:02.083 --> 19:05.083
FROM WHAT I'VE READ
ABOUT THESE SICK FUCKS,

19:05.083 --> 19:09.875
THEY USUALLY HAVE
SOME SORT OF CODE.

19:09.875 --> 19:12.542
I'D SAY DISRESPECT IS HIGH
ON HIS LIST OF VIOLATIONS.

19:12.542 --> 19:16.750
MAYBE IF YOU CAME AT HIM
WITH DEFERENCE.

19:18.208 --> 19:20.083
DEFERENCE, HUH?

19:21.917 --> 19:23.417
YEAH, THINK ABOUT IT.

19:23.417 --> 19:24.583
HEY, LIEUTENANT.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.500
I HEARD YOU SAY
YOUR FRIEND ELLEN IS ILL.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.917
WAS IT A STOMACH THING?

19:27.917 --> 19:29.750
BECAUSE I JUST READ
THIS ARTICLE--

19:29.750 --> 19:30.709
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

19:30.709 --> 19:32.208
I HAVEN'T HEARD BACK
FROM HER.

19:32.208 --> 19:33.959
I LEFT HER THREE MESSAGES.

19:33.959 --> 19:35.458
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.291
[thinking]
YEAH, ME TOO.

19:37.291 --> 19:40.125
I HOPE SHE DIDN'T GET
IN AN ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING.

19:40.125 --> 19:43.333
EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE AN ERRAND TO RUN.

19:52.792 --> 19:53.959
[thinking]
A HOME OFFICE.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.834
IF SHE WERE SICK,
THIS IS WHERE SHE'D BE.

19:56.834 --> 19:59.709
[doorbell rings]

20:10.000 --> 20:11.375
HER CAR'S HERE.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.208
SHE COULD HAVE GONE
FOR A REALLY LONG WALK.

20:13.208 --> 20:14.959
OR BORROWED A FRIEND'S CAR.

20:14.959 --> 20:18.166
OR MAYBE LAGUERTA'S RIGHT
AND ELLEN IS COMATOSE

20:18.166 --> 20:20.667
IN SOME HOSPITAL,
POST-ACCIDENT.

20:20.667 --> 20:23.083
ONE CAN HOPE.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.250
NOT THAT THERE ARE ANY SIGNS
OF FOUL PLAY HERE.

20:27.709 --> 20:30.375
BUT HARRY DID RAISE ME
TO BE PARANOID.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.375
[spraying]

20:40.291 --> 20:42.083

20:42.083 --> 20:44.542

20:44.542 --> 20:46.291

ELLEN WOLF IS INNOCENT.

20:46.291 --> 20:47.667
(Harry)
HELLO.

20:55.709 --> 20:57.166
IT'S JUST BLOOD.

20:57.166 --> 20:58.250
THERE'S NO BODY.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.709
HE WOULD EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH ONE.

20:59.709 --> 21:01.375
I NEVER TAUGHT HIM
HOW TO DISPOSE...

21:05.542 --> 21:08.083
AS FAR AS MIGUEL KNOWS,
THE BEST PLACE TO DISPOSE

21:08.083 --> 21:10.417
OF A BODY
IS BENEATH AN OPEN GRAVE.

21:10.417 --> 21:12.542
GOOD THINKING.

21:22.375 --> 21:24.375
HELLO.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.333
SYL'S OFFICE SAID
THAT SHE WOULD BE HERE.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.583
IS SHE OUT BACK OR--

21:39.583 --> 21:42.875
NO, SHE WASN'T FEELING UP
TO AN OPEN HOUSE,

21:42.875 --> 21:44.083

21:46.208 --> 21:47.417
WELL, YOU'RE
A GOOD FRIEND.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.500

YOU SHOULD HAVE THESE.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.250
HOW ABOUT I MAKE SURE
SYL GETS THEM?

22:00.291 --> 22:02.417
MIGUEL.

22:04.834 --> 22:07.583
FLOWERS ARE A GOOD START,
BUT CAN I BE HONEST?

22:07.583 --> 22:09.417
I LIKE HONEST.

22:11.083 --> 22:12.125
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

22:12.125 --> 22:13.417
THAT'S HONEST.

22:13.417 --> 22:16.625
YOU WERE SMART ENOUGH
TO ASK HER TO MARRY YOU,

22:16.625 --> 22:18.500
AND SHE'S STILL
THAT SAME FANTASTIC WOMAN.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.125
YOU DON'T THINK
I KNOW THAT?

22:20.125 --> 22:21.959
WELL, YOU'RE NOT ACTING
THAT WAY.

22:21.959 --> 22:23.458
I AM NOT HAVING
A GODDAMN AFFAIR, OKAY.

22:23.458 --> 22:25.875
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SAY
THAT'S THE TRUTH.
IT IS.

22:25.875 --> 22:29.458
EITHER WAY,
YOU VIOLATED HER TRUST.

22:29.458 --> 22:31.333
I JUST NEEDED SPACE.

22:31.333 --> 22:33.709
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
FALLING APART AROUND ME NOW,

22:33.709 --> 22:36.417
YOU KNOW, OSCAR, RAMON,
NOW MY CASES--

22:36.417 --> 22:40.125
AND THE SAME THINGS
ARE FALLING APART FOR HER,

22:40.125 --> 22:42.125
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR PARTNER.

22:46.291 --> 22:49.375
YOU'RE A WISE PERSON,
AREN'T YOU?

22:49.375 --> 22:51.875
[laughs]

22:51.875 --> 22:54.792
WELL, IF I AM, IT'S ONLY
BECAUSE I'VE LEARNED

22:54.792 --> 22:57.667
FROM MY MANY, MANY MISTAKES.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.250
YOU HAVE INSIGHT.

22:59.250 --> 23:02.500
AND I TELL YOU WHAT.

23:05.041 --> 23:06.500
I'M GONNA FOLLOW
YOUR LEAD.

23:10.667 --> 23:13.333
SO POINT THE WAY.

23:22.959 --> 23:24.041
MR. KING, I UNDERSTAND

23:24.041 --> 23:25.458
THAT RESPECT IS VERY IMPORTANT
TO YOU.

23:25.458 --> 23:27.834
YES, MA'AM.

23:27.834 --> 23:29.959
AND I'M SURE YOU FEEL

23:29.959 --> 23:33.750
THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO EARN
YOUR RESPECT.

23:33.750 --> 23:36.750
YES, MA'AM.

23:36.750 --> 23:37.667
I FEEL
LIKE YOU'VE EARNED THIS.

23:40.041 --> 23:42.458
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LITTLE GARDENER? HUH?

23:42.458 --> 23:44.333
YOU FEEL DISRESPECTED?

23:44.333 --> 23:46.709
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT
IN PRISON

23:46.709 --> 23:48.458
BECAUSE YOUR FOREMAN MARIO'S
NEXT DOOR,

23:48.458 --> 23:50.083
AND HE IS SPILLING
HIS GUTS.

23:54.208 --> 23:56.208
YOU ARE SO SURE
HE'S AFRAID OF YOU. WHY?

23:56.208 --> 23:57.250
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO HIM?

23:57.250 --> 23:58.417
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO ANTON?

23:58.417 --> 24:00.375
WHAT DID YOU DO?!
MORGAN! MORGAN!

24:03.041 --> 24:04.417
FUCK.

24:14.709 --> 24:17.083
HELP!

24:17.083 --> 24:20.250
[gasping]

24:20.250 --> 24:23.750
AAH!

24:23.750 --> 24:24.583
HELP ME!

24:31.375 --> 24:32.542
HEY.

24:32.542 --> 24:35.083
YOU KNOW, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE WORKING TOGETHER.

24:35.083 --> 24:37.041
YOU KEEP GOING OFF HALF-COCKED.
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TRUST YOU?

24:37.041 --> 24:38.500
YOU TRUST ME?
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.792
YOU'RE LUCKY BATISTA WASN'T
WATCHING THE MONITORS.

24:40.792 --> 24:41.875
WHAT THE FUCK
WERE YOU THINKING?

24:41.875 --> 24:43.250
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT ANTON.

24:43.250 --> 24:44.375
YOU OUGHTA TRY IT
SOME TIME.

24:44.375 --> 24:46.375
I WANT TO FIND HIM
JUST AS BAD AS YOU DO.

24:46.375 --> 24:49.750
IF YOU GAVE A SHIT
ABOUT ANTON,

24:49.750 --> 24:51.917
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE MADE HIM
YOUR FAKE C.I.

24:51.917 --> 24:53.041
AND HE WOULDN'T BE MESSED UP
IN THIS.

24:53.041 --> 24:54.458
YOU'RE THE ONE
TOO BUSY BONING HIM

24:54.458 --> 24:55.959
TO PROVIDE HIM
WITH PROTECTIVE SURVEILLANCE.

24:55.959 --> 24:57.917
YOU ARE SO CROSSING THE LINE
RIGHT NOW.

24:57.917 --> 24:59.667
AM I?

24:59.667 --> 25:01.375
YOU KNEW ANTON WAS IN TOWN.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.500
AND I FUCKING TOLD HIM
TO CALL IT IN.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.709
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED IT IN
YOUR FUCKING SELF.

25:12.125 --> 25:14.041
I KNOW.
IT'S MY FAULT.

25:14.041 --> 25:18.291
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:19.875 --> 25:21.709
I USED HIM.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.792
I...JUST FUCKING USED HIM.

25:33.959 --> 25:38.542
WE CAN ONLY HOLD GEORGE KING
FOR A FEW MORE HOURS.

25:40.667 --> 25:42.333
WE BETTER GET BACK
TO WORK.

25:50.583 --> 25:53.166
[thinking]
SCHEDULE SAYS THERE ARE
FOUR FUNERALS TODAY.

25:53.166 --> 25:56.291
GRAVES BACK-HOED LAST NIGHT.

25:56.291 --> 25:58.667
THAT'S FOUR
MIGUEL COULD HAVE CHOSEN FROM.

26:16.959 --> 26:18.667
SHE'S NOT HERE.
THAT'S ONE DOWN.

26:26.792 --> 26:31.208
THAT BLOOD MIGHT NOT EVEN BELONG
TO ELLEN.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.959
COULD BE A CLIENT'S BLOOD.

26:35.959 --> 26:37.542
OR THE PREVIOUS OWNER'S.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.125
HUH.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.709
HE DID IT.

26:57.709 --> 27:00.667
MIGUEL REALLY DID IT.

27:00.667 --> 27:02.250
AND I TAUGHT HIM HOW.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.333
I GUIDED HIM TO THIS.

27:04.333 --> 27:06.083
I CREATED...

27:06.083 --> 27:07.834
THIS.

27:07.834 --> 27:09.667
I'M SORRY.

27:21.959 --> 27:24.333
[Harry whistling]

27:29.333 --> 27:32.959
MIGUEL'S MAKING HIS OWN CHOICES
NOW.

27:37.250 --> 27:41.458
LOOK WHO HE CHOSE.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.000
SHE DIDN'T DESERVE THIS.

27:52.834 --> 27:55.625
YOU CAN SAY IT.

27:55.625 --> 27:57.333
WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING, DEX,

27:57.333 --> 27:59.291
WHETHER I TOLD YOU SO
OR NOT.

27:59.291 --> 28:02.834
EASIER TO ACCEPT IT.

28:02.834 --> 28:05.834
'CAUSE THERE'LL BE PLENTY MORE
WHERE ELLEN CAME FROM.

28:18.750 --> 28:21.959
NO, THERE WON'T.

28:31.291 --> 28:34.750
HEY, MIGUEL, IS IT TOO LATE
TO GRAB THAT LUNCH?

28:37.000 --> 28:41.667
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS GEORGE KING SICKO?

28:41.667 --> 28:43.291
SKINNER SUSPECT?

28:43.291 --> 28:44.625
MM-HMM.

28:44.625 --> 28:47.667
I GOTTA GO FROM HERE
TO YOUR PRECINCT

28:47.667 --> 28:52.125
TO DISCUSS WHETHER WE'RE GONNA
FILE CHARGES AGAINST THIS GUY.

28:52.125 --> 28:53.166
YOU THINK
HE'S THE GUY?

28:53.166 --> 28:55.166
HE'S THE GUY.

28:55.166 --> 28:56.250
SKINNER.

28:57.333 --> 28:59.917
WELL,
IF THE LAW CAN'T GET HIM,

28:59.917 --> 29:02.542
YOU AND I CAN.

29:02.542 --> 29:04.166
IN FACT,

29:04.166 --> 29:09.750
I COULD HAVE THIS GUY OUT
ON THE STREETS IN A FEW HOURS.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.750
YOU NEED SOME HELP
ON THIS ONE,

29:11.750 --> 29:13.875
OR IS THIS ANOTHER SOLO PROJECT?

29:20.667 --> 29:24.208
WE AGREED TO LEAVE
ELLEN WOLF ALONE.

29:24.208 --> 29:26.792
TECHNICALLY, WE AGREED
NOT TO KILL HER TOGETHER.

29:26.792 --> 29:27.750
AND WE DIDN'T.

29:27.750 --> 29:29.250
TECHNICALLY?

29:29.250 --> 29:32.000
I KNOW.
THAT'S--THAT'S BULLSHIT.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.500
I DIDN'T TELL YOU

29:33.500 --> 29:34.875
BECAUSE I KNOW
YOU WOULDN'T APPROVE.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.166
'CAUSE SHE WASN'T GUILTY.

29:36.166 --> 29:38.291
APPARENTLY, WE HAVE A DIFFERENT
DEFINITION OF THAT WORD.

29:38.291 --> 29:40.875
YOU GOT RID OF HER
BECAUSE SHE GOT IN YOUR WAY.

29:44.709 --> 29:48.709
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO SERVING JUSTICE?

29:48.709 --> 29:50.166
IS THAT REALLY
WHY YOU DO THIS, DEX?

29:50.166 --> 29:51.125
TO SERVE JUSTICE?

29:53.750 --> 29:55.375
WE DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND
WITH EACH OTHER.

29:55.375 --> 29:56.875
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

29:56.875 --> 30:00.500
OKAY.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.750
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

30:05.083 --> 30:06.542
IT WAS A CHICKENSHIT THING
TO DO,

30:06.542 --> 30:07.959
AND I ABUSED YOUR TRUST--

30:07.959 --> 30:10.375
A TRUST, BY THE WAY,
THAT WASN'T EASY TO EARN.

30:10.375 --> 30:11.750
THAT'S NOT LOST ON ME.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.792
I GAVE YOU MY SHIRT
LINKING ME TO FREEBO'S DEATH.

30:17.792 --> 30:19.875
I WISH I HAD ANOTHER ONE
TO PROVE TO YOU

30:19.875 --> 30:22.291
HOW IMPORTANT
THIS PARTNERSHIP IS TO ME.

30:22.291 --> 30:23.375
I'D TAKE
A LITTLE REMORSE.

30:23.375 --> 30:26.208
YOU WOULD KNOW
THAT I DON'T FEEL IT.

30:26.208 --> 30:28.667
YEAH, YOU'LL FEEL IT
IF YOU GET CAUGHT.

30:28.667 --> 30:31.250
I DIDN'T LEAVE
ANY EVIDENCE.

30:31.250 --> 30:35.250
THEY'RE JUST GONNA THINK IT WAS
ONE OF HER SCUMBAG CLIENTS.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.333
RIGHT.

30:38.333 --> 30:40.458
RIGHT, JUST ANOTHER LOWLIFE
WHO BEAT

30:40.458 --> 30:41.667
AND STABBED
AN INNOCENT WOMAN.

30:46.291 --> 30:49.291
AGAIN,
DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS.

30:51.875 --> 30:56.667
DEX.

30:56.667 --> 30:58.667
THIS IS THE NATURE
OF A REAL FRIENDSHIP.

30:58.667 --> 31:01.291
HMM?

31:01.291 --> 31:03.041
WE'RE GONNA DISAGREE.

31:03.041 --> 31:05.250
AND WHEN WE DO,
WE JUST GO OUR OWN WAY.

31:05.250 --> 31:07.458
NO, NO MORE
INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS.

31:07.458 --> 31:10.125
INDIVIDUALITY IS WHAT MAKES
AMERICA GREAT.

31:10.125 --> 31:12.542
I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT
OUR FOREFATHERS HAD IN MIND.

31:12.542 --> 31:16.000
LOOK.
I'M A BIG BOY.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.083
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

31:18.959 --> 31:20.583
EVENTUALLY,

31:20.583 --> 31:23.083
YOU'RE GONNA TRUST THAT TOO.

31:25.667 --> 31:27.542
I'LL SEE YOU
OVER AT THE PRECINCT.

31:27.542 --> 31:31.375
[thinking]
HE THINKS HE'S UNTOUCHABLE.

31:31.375 --> 31:32.542
HE'S NOT.

31:32.542 --> 31:35.166
IT'S TIME HE LEARNED THAT.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.125
PROBABLY NOT A LOT OF LEADS
ON THAT SCREEN.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.875
KING'S A GHOST.

31:59.875 --> 32:02.041
HE GRABBED ANTON

32:02.041 --> 32:03.875
WITHOUT A SINGLE SECURITY CAMERA
IN THE AREA

32:03.875 --> 32:06.000
PICKING UP HIM OR HIS TRUCK.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.709
THERE'S NOT ONE SHOT
TO IMPLICATE HIM.

32:11.083 --> 32:13.041
SO WE'LL HAVE TO GET IT
OUT OF KING.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.250
YOU GONNA LET QUINN DO IT
ON HIS OWN.

32:19.750 --> 32:23.208
MY TIME IS BETTER SPENT HERE.

32:23.208 --> 32:24.917
AWAY FROM PEOPLE.

32:24.917 --> 32:28.667
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE--

32:28.667 --> 32:31.959
A GOOD FRIEND, ACTUALLY--

32:31.959 --> 32:33.834
TOLD ME I HAD A BIG WALL
AROUND ME.

32:33.834 --> 32:36.375
I THOUGHT IT MADE ME
A BETTER COP.

32:36.375 --> 32:39.917
I DON'T THINK IT DID.

33:07.667 --> 33:08.667
[thinking]
THEY LOOK AT HIM
AND SEE A DEFENDER

33:08.667 --> 33:10.709
OF TRUTH, JUSTICE,

33:10.709 --> 33:12.500
AND THE AMERICAN WAY.

33:12.500 --> 33:15.291
I SEE A MAN ABOUT TO LEARN
A HARD LESSON.

33:15.291 --> 33:17.917
(Batista)
TIRE TRACKS IN THE ALLEY
ARE CONSISTENT

33:17.917 --> 33:18.917
WITH KING'S TRUCK.

33:18.917 --> 33:20.750
AND SEVERAL OTHER
THOUSAND TRUCKS

33:20.750 --> 33:21.834
IN THE MIAMI METRO AREA.

33:21.834 --> 33:25.250
KING'S COMPANY
TRIMS TREES.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.709
NOW TRIMMED TREES WERE FOUND
IN EVERY ONE

33:26.709 --> 33:27.917
OF THE VICTIMS' HOMES.

33:27.917 --> 33:28.667
THAT'S THE LEAD
THAT NAILED HIM.

33:28.667 --> 33:31.959
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT NAILED.

33:31.959 --> 33:33.792
THE TREES AT MY PLACE
JUST GOT TRIMMED TOO.

33:33.792 --> 33:35.959
YEAH, BUT MARIO ASTORGA--

33:35.959 --> 33:37.125
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FOREMAN,
RIGHT?

33:37.125 --> 33:38.792
A FOREMAN WHO'S TERRIFIED
OF HIS BOSS.

33:38.792 --> 33:41.250
YOU CAN ARREST MY BOSS
ON THAT SAME EVIDENCE.

33:41.250 --> 33:42.458
HE'S THE FUCKING GUY.

33:42.458 --> 33:44.125
[clears throat]

33:45.208 --> 33:46.125
SIR.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.166
(LaGuerta)
MIGUEL.

33:47.166 --> 33:48.959
MAY I?

33:53.291 --> 33:55.041
WE REALLY NEED YOUR HELP
ON THIS ONE.

33:55.041 --> 33:57.625
AND YOU DO OWE US
FOR GETTING RAMON OFF.

33:57.625 --> 33:58.792
I DO.

33:58.792 --> 34:00.291
BUT I CAN'T VERY WELL CHARGE

34:00.291 --> 34:01.959
MR. KING WITH ASSAULT
ON A PALM TREE.

34:01.959 --> 34:04.959
YOU HAVE YOUR WAYS,
MIGUEL.

34:04.959 --> 34:06.917
YOU'VE BENT RULES BEFORE.

34:06.917 --> 34:09.500
GETTING PEOPLE LOST
IN THE SYSTEM.

34:09.500 --> 34:13.208
WE NEED TO BUY TIME
FOR ANTON BRIGGS.

34:17.166 --> 34:19.542
FOR YOU. I'LL DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER.

34:24.667 --> 34:28.333
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

34:29.834 --> 34:31.792
SHOWTIME.

34:31.792 --> 34:33.667
DEX, GET YOUR KIT.

34:33.667 --> 34:35.000
YOU TOO, MASUKA.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.542
HEY, IT'S CALLED OFF-DUTY.
NOT ANYMORE.

34:36.542 --> 34:39.333
YOU TWO,
YOU STAY ON KING.

34:39.333 --> 34:40.500
DON'T LET UP.
WE GOT ANOTHER BODY.

34:42.500 --> 34:43.667
ANTON?

34:43.667 --> 34:45.333
A FEMALE AT THE CEMETERY.

35:11.875 --> 35:14.208
CAUSE OF DEATH?

35:14.208 --> 35:15.500
TAKE YOUR PICK.

35:15.500 --> 35:19.000
SEVER BEATING,
STRANGULATION...

35:19.000 --> 35:22.792
PLUS THREE STAB WOUNDS.

35:22.792 --> 35:26.041
WHOEVER DID THIS
WAS NOT A FAN.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.208
[thinking]
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

35:28.208 --> 35:29.250
THINK OUR KILLER'S A PRO.

35:29.250 --> 35:31.041
I HAVEN'T SEEN MANY BODY DUMPS
THIS CLEAN.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.417
[thinking]
I MADE SURE OF THAT.

35:32.417 --> 35:35.458
MIGUEL GETTING CAUGHT
ISN'T PART OF THE LESSON PLAN.

35:35.458 --> 35:38.250
(Masuka)
ANGEL, DON'T LET HER SEE THIS.

35:40.166 --> 35:41.458
(LaGuerta)
NO, THEY SAID IT WAS HER.

35:41.458 --> 35:42.625
BUT IT'S NOT, IS IT?

35:42.625 --> 35:44.375
MARIA, I'M SORRY.

35:44.375 --> 35:47.250
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE--

35:49.083 --> 35:50.750
OH, MY GOD.

35:50.750 --> 35:51.667
