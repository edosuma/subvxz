00:53.219 --> 00:54.391
Gentlemen.

00:54.421 --> 00:57.095
I hope you had a merry Christmas.

00:57.123 --> 00:59.626
Good morning, sir. Are you feeling better?

00:59.659 --> 01:02.265
Christmas seems to hit me
harder each year, Murdoch.

01:02.295 --> 01:04.605
Sorry I dropped out early last night.

01:04.631 --> 01:06.508
I missed Margaret's
rum pudding, apparently.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.443
It was delicious, as always.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.908
I told you, He did nothing wrong!

01:11.938 --> 01:13.679
- George?
- Sir.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.185
Gideon Turner.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.585
We found him up on Bloor
street with a man in a headlock.

01:17.610 --> 01:20.921
He was about to throw himself
off the Rosedale valley bridge.

01:20.947 --> 01:23.154
How do you know that, Mr. Turner?

01:23.183 --> 01:24.685
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.856
Christmas was yesterday, Mr. Turner.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.990
Now, either you tell us the truth,

01:28.021 --> 01:29.701
or you'll find my very own personal version

01:29.756 --> 01:31.133
of boxing day in our cells.

01:31.157 --> 01:32.135
No, no, you can't.

01:32.158 --> 01:35.765
I must prevent a murder at 10:00.

01:35.795 --> 01:39.265
Oh, lord. I-l have to go.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.644
- Sir!
- Get him!

01:42.669 --> 01:44.342
Get after him, Crabtree!

02:11.498 --> 02:12.909
Seth Morgan.

02:18.004 --> 02:19.881
It's him! It's Santa Claus.

02:19.906 --> 02:22.750
George, after him!

02:24.077 --> 02:25.647
George.

02:25.678 --> 02:28.158
Mr. Turner, explain yourself.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.854
Murdoch.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.487
Hey. This man saved my life.

02:32.519 --> 02:33.520
It's true, sir.

02:33.553 --> 02:35.499
Mr. Turner sent the shot wild.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.934
There'll be plenty more
of that back at the station

02:37.991 --> 02:39.993
if you don't tell us how you
knew this was going to happen.

02:40.026 --> 02:42.165
I saw it happen.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.832
I've been to the future.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.243
You've been to the future?

02:52.272 --> 02:53.444
How'd you manage that, then?

02:53.506 --> 02:56.112
I can't tell you that.
I've said too much already.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.679
Bloody hell. He's crackers.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.749
I lost him, sir. He
escaped down a coal chute.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.852
He left this behind.
It's a piece of his suit.

03:03.883 --> 03:04.884
All right, George.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.591
Escort Mr. Morgan to the
station for questioning

03:06.619 --> 03:07.927
and see if you can lift any finger marks

03:07.954 --> 03:08.932
off this casing.

03:08.955 --> 03:09.933
Sir.

03:09.956 --> 03:11.230
I'll have some constables
search the coal chute.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.361
Thank you.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.228
Right, then.

03:15.261 --> 03:17.901
Do you have any more future
crimes you'd like to prevent?

03:17.931 --> 03:19.569
No, but I have to stop a boy

03:19.599 --> 03:20.907
from being run over by a carriage

03:20.934 --> 03:22.414
at the corner of queen and parliament.

03:22.435 --> 03:24.938
- Ah. What time?
- 3:15.

03:24.971 --> 03:27.815
Wonderful. That gives us time to chat.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.289
How did you know Mr. Morgan

03:33.313 --> 03:36.590
would be at that location
at that exact time?

03:36.616 --> 03:38.789
I've already told you.

03:38.818 --> 03:41.458
You have not been to
the future, Mr. Turner.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.296
And if you persist in this delusion,

03:43.323 --> 03:44.825
I will commit you for observation

03:44.891 --> 03:46.564
at the provincial lunatic asylum.

03:46.593 --> 03:49.733
You can't do that. I'm completely sane.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.764
I never saw Mr. Turner before.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.505
How did he know you were gonna be there?

03:53.566 --> 03:54.636
I have no idea.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.442
I was just on my way to meet someone.

03:56.469 --> 03:57.470
Who?

03:57.503 --> 03:59.983
I've been seeing certain married women.

04:00.006 --> 04:03.010
- Which women?
- Could be any one of a dozen.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.420
I have a weakness.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.921
He maintains his belief
that he's been to the future.

04:09.949 --> 04:11.622
Well, if he committed no crime...

04:11.651 --> 04:13.631
I intend to have Dr. Roberts conduct

04:13.653 --> 04:16.862
a full mental evaluation of Mr. Turner.

04:16.923 --> 04:17.993
And Mr. Morgan?

04:18.024 --> 04:19.833
He liked to seduce married women.

04:19.858 --> 04:20.997
Oh.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.665
Well, that gives us some insight

04:22.695 --> 04:24.265
into who may have tried to shoot him.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.004
12 husbands to pick from.

04:26.666 --> 04:27.838
Not that he'll name any.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.143
You didn't use your customary persuasion?

04:30.169 --> 04:32.376
I didn't have the heart
to knock it out of him,

04:32.438 --> 04:34.281
Christmas spirit and all that.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.379
'Sir?

04:39.445 --> 04:42.324
I managed to find a partial
print on the shell casing.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.157
Most likely a thumb mark
from when the shooter

04:44.183 --> 04:46.163
inserted the bullet into the chamber.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.530
Unfortunately, the rest
of the cartridge was clean.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.466
Sir, according to Mr. Turner,

04:51.491 --> 04:53.801
a boy is going to be
trampled by a horse at 3:15.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.737
Should I make sure
that that doesn't happen?

04:55.795 --> 04:57.172
George, I don't believe that anyone

04:57.196 --> 04:58.834
has been traveling through time.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.138
But something strange is going on.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.738
- Take Henry.
- Sir.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.807
Also, sir, one other thing.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.309
As you know, this Sunday
is the turn of the century.

05:10.343 --> 05:11.413
Yes.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.424
Well, I was thinking about
asking Dr. grace to accompany me

05:14.480 --> 05:15.515
to the policemen's ball, but...

05:15.548 --> 05:16.526
Oh.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.824
She's a doctor, and I'm just a copper.

05:20.586 --> 05:22.327
I just don't want to embarrass myself.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.858
I don't want to embarrass her.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.700
I think you should ask her, George.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.673
- Really?
- Really.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.949
It appears Mr. Turner

05:44.010 --> 05:46.923
has a desperate need to help others.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.892
It stems from feelings of inadequacy,

05:48.915 --> 05:50.622
low self-worth.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.459
But it is strange how he
knew about the shooting.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.055
Yes.

05:55.088 --> 05:58.035
Is it possible that he hired someone

05:58.057 --> 05:59.365
to dress up like Santa Claus

05:59.392 --> 06:01.599
and pretend to attempt to kill Mr. Morgan

06:01.627 --> 06:03.368
all so that he could save him?

06:03.396 --> 06:04.602
Mm.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.303
People have been known to purposely create

06:06.366 --> 06:08.903
desperate situations that
only they can resolve.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.312
Hmm.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.316
I'll keep him under observation.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.817
Thank you, doctor.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.722
No! You can't!

06:18.745 --> 06:20.383
I have to rescue the boy!

06:20.413 --> 06:21.949
The boy!

06:21.981 --> 06:23.289
William'?

06:24.951 --> 06:26.259
Julia.

06:28.721 --> 06:32.134
The nightmares started soon
after Ä± was buried alive.

06:32.158 --> 06:35.139
They became so bad, I was
afraid to sleep at night.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.606
I can only imagine.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.905
So you came to see Dr. Roberts? Yes.

06:38.931 --> 06:41.104
I agreed to an experimental treatment

06:41.134 --> 06:42.772
which induced seizures.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.509
That sounds drastic.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.607
Yes, but it worked wonders.

06:46.639 --> 06:49.415
I have nothing but sweet dreams now.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.444
But if you're cured...

06:51.477 --> 06:54.458
Oh, I'm no longer in treatment.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.824
I'm here because I've
been studying psychiatry.

06:56.849 --> 06:58.692
It's a fascinating field.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.493
Then you might be
interested in what I'm up to.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.000
Oh, and what is that?

07:03.022 --> 07:04.933
Well, it's a curious case:

07:04.957 --> 07:07.437
A man who believes he's been to the future.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.438
He's quite convinced.

07:08.461 --> 07:11.135
And he thinks he's something of a hero.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.269
I believe the psychologist Emil kraepelin

07:13.299 --> 07:15.836
refers to patterns of
behavior as syndromes.

07:15.868 --> 07:18.712
Perhaps this man is
suffering from hero syndrome.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.850
But why the future?

07:21.874 --> 07:25.515
Perhaps he wants to be a
hero with superhuman ability-

07:25.545 --> 07:27.491
a superhero, as it were.

07:27.513 --> 07:28.719
Hmm.

07:28.781 --> 07:32.194
Well, you're welcome to observe
my investigation if you like.

07:32.218 --> 07:34.459
I'd be delighted.

07:34.487 --> 07:35.727
Superhero?

07:35.788 --> 07:36.994
Yes, sir.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.832
It would appear that Mr. Turner

07:38.858 --> 07:40.201
may have set up the whole shooting

07:40.226 --> 07:42.172
just so that he could stop it.

07:42.195 --> 07:46.803
Seth Morgan will be relieved to hear that.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.574
Murdoch, take a look at this.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.841
I've been holding on to it for a few days.

07:55.875 --> 07:59.322
Sir, they're offering you the
position of chief constable.

07:59.345 --> 08:00.551
In Ottawa.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.526
Not as big as this town, but prestigious.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.926
That's quite an honor, sir.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.054
Will you accept?

08:06.085 --> 08:07.587
I don't know yet.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.224
It's an administrative position.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.258
I wouldn't really be a copper anymore.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.032
When do you have to let them know?

08:14.060 --> 08:16.267
By the new year.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.536
New century.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.068
Detective Murdoch.

08:22.101 --> 08:23.546
Teddy Nelson, the gazette.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.912
I've heard you brought in a man

08:24.937 --> 08:26.575
claiming to be from the future.

08:26.606 --> 08:27.846
Is there any truth to that?

08:27.874 --> 08:30.115
The man in question is
undergoing a full evaluation

08:30.176 --> 08:32.121
at the provincial lunatic asylum.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.125
Sir, everything happened
exactly as Turner said.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.024
He may be from the future after all.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.529
Uh... This is a police matter.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.429
Hodge?

08:42.722 --> 08:44.429
Sir, Higgins and I went down

08:44.457 --> 08:46.437
to the corner of queen and
parliament, as instructed.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.097
- We waited there till almost 3:30, sir.

08:48.127 --> 08:49.435
We were about to pack it in when, suddenly,

08:49.462 --> 08:52.033
Higgins sees this carriage
barreling down queen street

08:52.064 --> 08:53.134
at considerable speed.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.270
And then this urchin comes
bolting out of an alley, sir,

08:55.301 --> 08:56.541
right into it's path.

08:56.569 --> 08:57.809
- Was the boy hurt?
- No.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.406
Mr. Turner was there to stop it.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.644
Mr. Turner?

09:00.706 --> 09:02.811
He came out of nowhere, sir,
scooped up the young lad,

09:02.875 --> 09:04.650
and spirited him off to safety.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.417
Where's Mr. Turner now?

09:06.445 --> 09:07.947
He ran off.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.926
We left him in ward c.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.758
Which was locked, was it not?

09:11.784 --> 09:13.661
Yes, but he jumped out of a window.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.255
I only hope he's all right.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.665
My goodness.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.895
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

09:18.925 --> 09:21.303
Well, he works with a
Professor named Harms.

09:21.327 --> 09:24.171
I believe you can find him on Blair street.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.247
Sir, look at this.

09:46.018 --> 09:47.520
Mr. Turner.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.430
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to see this.

09:49.455 --> 09:52.664
This-this is Professor Harms' machine.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.763
Where is Professor Harms?

09:54.794 --> 09:57.297
- He's in the future.
- The future?

09:57.330 --> 09:58.331
Who are you?

09:58.364 --> 10:00.207
Teddy Nelson, Toronto gazette.

10:12.845 --> 10:14.847
Bloody hell.

10:20.152 --> 10:21.859
What is this?

10:21.887 --> 10:22.991
I'm sorry, Professor.

10:23.022 --> 10:25.798
They came uninvited. I
tried to get them to leave.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.532
Is that a time machine?

10:27.560 --> 10:29.130
George, get Mr. Nelson out of here.

10:29.161 --> 10:31.334
Sir, Mr. Nelson, please, if you will,

10:31.364 --> 10:32.866
come with me.

10:32.898 --> 10:36.004
Professor harms, what is going on here?

10:36.035 --> 10:37.013
What's going on

10:37.036 --> 10:38.640
is that I'm engaged in
an important experiment,

10:38.671 --> 10:40.742
and you're trespassing on my property.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.683
I'm investigating the attempted murder.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.984
Mr. Turner prevented this morning.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.684
Gideon, you were instructed

10:46.712 --> 10:48.988
never to interfere with the future.

10:49.015 --> 10:51.518
How could I not, knowing what I know?

10:52.918 --> 10:55.398
What laws have we broken?

10:55.421 --> 10:56.832
To start with,

10:56.856 --> 11:00.770
it appears that you've
violated the laws of physics.

11:00.826 --> 11:04.603
I'm sorry, detective,

11:04.664 --> 11:06.701
but I cannot allow you to
interfere with the device

11:06.732 --> 11:09.008
I've devoted my life to building.

11:09.035 --> 11:11.345
I know my rights.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.576
Provide me with a warrant,

11:12.605 --> 11:14.414
or leave my premises immediately.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.442
Those are your options.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.123
But there is another.

11:20.713 --> 11:23.353
When I was teaching at
the polytechnic in Zurich,

11:23.382 --> 11:24.952
one of my students, an Albert Einstein,

11:25.017 --> 11:27.623
suggested a radical way to
reconcile the laws of mechanics

11:27.687 --> 11:29.462
with Maxwell's equations.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.298
Not only was time inextricable from space,

11:32.358 --> 11:34.269
but my mathematical derivation

11:34.293 --> 11:36.295
suggested that it would be possible,

11:36.362 --> 11:38.035
with sufficient energy,

11:38.064 --> 11:39.270
to pass from one point in time

11:39.298 --> 11:41.278
to a point in the distant future.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.577
And you've succeeded in
doing this with this machine?

11:44.603 --> 11:45.638
Yes.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.777
You're telling me you've
traveled to the 20th century?

11:48.808 --> 11:51.084
Only as far as 1912.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.590
I cannot yet go beyond that.

11:53.612 --> 11:55.319
But your man Mr. Turner

11:55.381 --> 11:58.658
has now altered the very
future that you witnessed.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.459
How do you reconcile that?

12:00.486 --> 12:03.228
Yes. That is a problem.

12:03.255 --> 12:04.791
A problem?

12:04.824 --> 12:07.737
Perhaps more than one future exists.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.671
Perhaps every time you travel,

12:09.729 --> 12:12.573
the universe splits into
two possible futures.

12:12.598 --> 12:15.169
What other explanation is there?

12:17.303 --> 12:18.646
He's got a point.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.344
Your Professor didn't go to the press.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.181
The press found him.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.653
Sir, perhaps that was the point,

12:24.677 --> 12:27.988
to have Mr. Turner make
a show of stopping a crime

12:28.013 --> 12:30.459
in public to attract the press.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.520
But where's the profit in it?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.155
I could see one person pulling a hoax

12:34.186 --> 12:36.632
for the sheer sport of it, but
what about the rest of them?

12:36.655 --> 12:38.464
The boy, the shooter?

12:38.491 --> 12:41.301
What's in it for them?

12:41.327 --> 12:43.671
Fraud is not without precedent.

12:43.696 --> 12:46.540
Redheffer had his perpetual motion machine,

12:46.599 --> 12:50.308
and P.T. Barnum displayed
the skeleton of a mermaid.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.373
What would motivate a respected scientist

12:52.438 --> 12:54.941
such as Professor Harms
to perpetrate such a fraud?

12:54.974 --> 12:59.218
A deep-seated desire for fame, I imagine.

12:59.278 --> 13:03.727
Even if his fraud was
certain to be exposed as such?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.490
Or perhaps his desire for fame

13:05.518 --> 13:08.863
exceeded his concern for his reputation.

13:08.888 --> 13:11.801
I'm sorry. I, uh...

13:11.824 --> 13:15.033
I don't mean to appear glib.

13:15.060 --> 13:18.337
I'm trying to bend my analysis
to fit your assumption.

13:18.364 --> 13:23.040
There is a more rational
explanation at hand.

13:23.068 --> 13:25.048
What's that?

13:25.070 --> 13:28.677
The time machine works.

13:30.209 --> 13:31.847
Dr. Roberts, are you all right?

13:33.379 --> 13:35.381
No, I

13:35.414 --> 13:38.588
I've been diagnosed
with Huntington's chorea.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.426
The degenerative nerve condition.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.523
It's heritable.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.728
My father had it.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.259
I'm terribly sorry.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.565
Hmm.

13:47.593 --> 13:52.008
One must play with the cards one is dealt.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.772
I am...

13:55.401 --> 13:56.937
I, uh... I'm sorry.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.242
I have an appointment.

13:58.270 --> 14:01.342
Please, see yourselves out.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.288
So, William, what are you thinking?

14:07.346 --> 14:10.054
I'm still convinced
that this is a deception

14:10.082 --> 14:12.756
orchestrated by Professor
Harms and Mr. Turner.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.560
But it seems extreme for Mr. Turner

14:14.587 --> 14:16.260
to throw himself through a window

14:16.288 --> 14:19.861
unless he really believed that
a boy's life was in danger.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.634
Then we speak with Mr. Turner.

14:23.562 --> 14:24.802
Mr. Turner,

14:24.864 --> 14:27.435
how did you know the boy
was about to be trampled?

14:27.466 --> 14:29.946
I saw it happen with my own eyes.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.472
When you were in the future?

14:32.538 --> 14:34.381
It was terrible.

14:34.406 --> 14:37.114
I couldn't let it happen again. I couldn't.

14:37.142 --> 14:38.212
And how did you know

14:38.244 --> 14:40.246
Seth Morgan was about to be shot?

14:40.279 --> 14:43.749
I saw that too. Same with the suicide.

14:43.782 --> 14:47.821
Mr. Turner, most people
live out their entire lives

14:47.887 --> 14:49.958
without witnessing such an event,

14:49.989 --> 14:52.663
and yet you saw three,

14:52.725 --> 14:54.568
all in a matter of hours.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.266
How do you explain that?

14:56.295 --> 14:58.798
I can't.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.572
Maybe...

15:00.599 --> 15:02.442
Maybe what, Mr. Turner?

15:03.502 --> 15:06.506
Maybe God directed me.

15:06.572 --> 15:10.076
Maybe God chose me to save them.

15:14.179 --> 15:17.353
Do you believe him?

15:17.416 --> 15:19.418
I believe that he believes.

15:19.451 --> 15:23.024
How does Professor Harms fit into it?

15:23.088 --> 15:25.694
Perhaps he has somehow
harnessed Mr. Turner's delusion.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.337
William, I have to say,

15:31.363 --> 15:33.036
this is exhilarating.

15:37.803 --> 15:39.783
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.629
Dr. grace, I hope I'm not interrupting.

15:52.651 --> 15:54.528
Of course not. What a pleasant surprise.

15:54.553 --> 15:55.554
Well, what I came to tell you,

15:55.621 --> 15:56.964
unfortunately, I'm very busy now

15:56.989 --> 15:58.366
that news of this time
machine has gotten out.

15:58.390 --> 15:59.528
Time machine?

15:59.558 --> 16:01.299
- How fascinating!
- Oh, yes.

16:01.327 --> 16:04.399
But I was wondering if you would join me-

16:04.463 --> 16:05.407
of course. A time machine?

16:05.464 --> 16:07.569
I would love to see it for myself.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.579
Uh, n-

16:23.315 --> 16:25.317
Imagine it, George.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.160
Here we are at the dawn of a new century.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.494
Really, after new year's Eve,

16:28.520 --> 16:30.591
it's just another day, is it not?

16:30.656 --> 16:31.862
Well, I suppose in a way-

16:31.890 --> 16:33.699
- what if I were to travel to tomorrow

16:33.726 --> 16:36.900
and come upon my future self?

16:36.929 --> 16:38.272
I suppose your future self

16:38.330 --> 16:39.707
would be expecting your past self,

16:39.732 --> 16:42.440
having already traveled from
the past into the future.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.822
Which would then be the present.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.407
Excellent point.

16:46.438 --> 16:48.850
Dr. grace, would you accompany me to the-

16:48.874 --> 16:49.852
oh, George!

16:59.852 --> 17:03.629
What did you see, Mrs. Haversham?

17:03.689 --> 17:05.862
I've seen the future.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.733
My future.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.897
Thank you, Professor.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.574
Amazing.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.375
So it's settled.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.366
We're ringing in the new
century with the Lamonte.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.145
What fun!

17:26.211 --> 17:29.658
I'm going to a meeting with Dr. Roberts.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.750
What?

17:30.783 --> 17:34.287
You're giving up your practice
of real medicine for psychiatry?

17:34.319 --> 17:37.960
Darcy, this field has a
great deal of validity.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.560
In fact, Dr. Roberts and I

17:39.591 --> 17:43.403
are assisting detective Murdoch on a case.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.409
How long has that been going on?

17:45.431 --> 17:47.638
It's a recent development.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.836
I may be late for dinner.

17:57.443 --> 18:01.653
You say you traveled to the year 1912.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.750
Is that correct?

18:02.781 --> 18:03.816
Yes.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.760
What did you see?

18:05.784 --> 18:08.162
The most wonderful thing.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.690
My son. He was elected mayor.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.498
Oh. That is something.

18:13.525 --> 18:15.027
And that's not the half of it.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.438
My daughter voted for him.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.500
Can you imagine it?

18:19.531 --> 18:21.875
We women shall have the vote.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.175
Astounding.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.383
She seems perfectly sincere.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.115
As does Mr. Turner.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.184
Do you think it's possible

18:33.212 --> 18:36.022
for two people to share the same delusion?

18:36.048 --> 18:38.187
There have been instances of mass delusion,

18:38.217 --> 18:40.356
the witches of Salem
being an obvious example,

18:40.385 --> 18:43.161
but this is quite different from that.

18:43.188 --> 18:45.031
Murdoch!

18:45.057 --> 18:47.059
I should go.

18:54.533 --> 18:55.671
'Sir?

18:55.701 --> 18:58.477
I've decided to take the
chief constable position.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.916
I wanted you to be the first to know.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.213
Oh.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.152
Congratulations, sir.

19:04.176 --> 19:07.157
Then let's drink, shall we?

19:07.179 --> 19:10.058
Station house number 4 won't
be the same without you, sir.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.220
To the future.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.491
Sirs, you should see all the people

19:13.519 --> 19:14.930
outside Professor Harms' lab,

19:14.987 --> 19:17.058
some of Toronto's highest and mightiest,

19:17.089 --> 19:19.660
all lined up for a trip to the future.

19:19.691 --> 19:22.001
He's offering time travel tours now?

19:22.027 --> 19:24.098
Yes, sir. At $1,000 a ticket.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.369
Well, that settles it, then.

19:25.397 --> 19:26.899
This is no hoax, Murdoch.

19:26.932 --> 19:30.277
No, it's a swindle.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.178
Join me, Crabtree.

19:40.612 --> 19:42.250
Just a short questionnaire

19:42.281 --> 19:44.090
to ensure your fitness for the journey.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.858
No, miss, you do not need
to change your clothing.

19:46.885 --> 19:49.092
Uh, sir, I understand your impatience,

19:49.121 --> 19:51.032
but everyone will get their opportunity.

19:51.056 --> 19:54.936
No, sir, you can pay
Professor Harms directly.

19:54.960 --> 19:55.961
It is indeed

19:56.028 --> 19:58.235
a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

19:58.263 --> 19:59.469
I myself have traveled

19:59.531 --> 20:02.774
and can assure you, it's perfectly safe.

20:02.801 --> 20:04.803
Inspector Murdoch.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.781
You've had a change of heart?

20:06.805 --> 20:08.443
You could say that.

20:08.473 --> 20:10.919
How much money have you
made in the past two days?

20:10.943 --> 20:13.082
The money is not for me.

20:13.111 --> 20:16.251
The machine has to exist in the future.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.555
It must be maintained.

20:17.583 --> 20:20.928
Uh, bills. Taxes must be paid.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.261
With sufficient money,

20:22.287 --> 20:25.496
we should be able to travel
into the next millennium.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.663
Imagine what the world
will be like in 2012.

20:30.395 --> 20:34.002
You asked for a warrant. Here it is.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.602
Uh, detective.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.815
If you don't believe it works,
put your faith to the test.

20:40.839 --> 20:43.911
You're suggesting that
I travel to the future?

20:43.942 --> 20:46.980
Why wait for the new year
to see the 20th century?

20:49.448 --> 20:51.621
Are you so incurious, detective?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.929
At the instant of transport,

20:55.954 --> 20:57.831
you will momentarily lose consciousness.

20:57.856 --> 21:01.167
You'll awaken on the other side in 1912.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.104
You can stay as long as you like,

21:03.128 --> 21:06.302
but you must return to the machine.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.311
I knew it!

21:48.340 --> 21:50.547
I knew you were coming!

21:54.012 --> 21:56.253
You don't know who I am, do you?

21:58.650 --> 21:59.890
Pardon my manners.

22:02.187 --> 22:03.427
William Murdoch, Jr.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.525
Welcome to 1912.

22:05.557 --> 22:07.901
Uncle George said you'd be coming.

22:15.367 --> 22:16.869
We'd better hurry. Come on.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.347
We're doing an experiment.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.179
Whoa!

22:27.112 --> 22:29.183
William! You're going to miss it!

22:29.214 --> 22:31.353
Coming!

22:31.383 --> 22:32.418
I've got to go.

22:32.451 --> 22:35.091
Come watch, but you can't
let them know you're here.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.865
See you when I'm born.

22:48.867 --> 22:53.407
So the candle causes the
air above it to heat up.

22:53.438 --> 22:55.748
This causes negative pressure

22:55.774 --> 22:57.754
relative to the air surrounding it

22:57.776 --> 23:00.256
and forces the hot air up.

23:00.278 --> 23:03.885
But because it's trapped
inside the enclosure,

23:03.915 --> 23:06.395
the whole balloon rises up with it.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.569
' Wow!

23:19.598 --> 23:21.600
That's incredible.

23:56.868 --> 23:58.973
What did you see, detective?

23:59.004 --> 24:01.348
What was it like?

24:01.373 --> 24:03.478
I saw the future.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.217
The time machine is real.

24:15.053 --> 24:16.862
One at a time, one at a time.

24:17.722 --> 24:21.499
"Detective William
Murdoch of station house 4

24:21.526 --> 24:25.338
"confirmed yesterday that
he had visited the future

24:25.363 --> 24:27.843
in Professor Harms "time machine."

24:27.866 --> 24:30.073
The report is accurate.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.976
Have you forgotten this is a swindle?

24:33.004 --> 24:34.005
Actually, sir,

24:34.039 --> 24:35.882
all of the money that
Professor Harms collects

24:35.907 --> 24:37.545
goes into a trust fund

24:37.576 --> 24:39.852
to maintain the machine in the future.

24:39.878 --> 24:41.414
What was it like, sir?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.687
Were there flying machines,
carriages with wings?

24:43.715 --> 24:45.160
No, no, George.

24:45.183 --> 24:46.992
I only went as far as 1912.

24:47.018 --> 24:48.861
So what did you see, sir?

24:48.887 --> 24:50.161
Well, uh...

24:50.188 --> 24:52.099
Sir, I saw my son.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.068
He was eight years old.

24:54.092 --> 24:55.662
He was very excited to see me.

24:55.694 --> 24:58.265
A son, sir? Well, congratulations.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.832
I should like to have a son someday.

25:02.033 --> 25:03.034
Who was the mother?

25:03.068 --> 25:04.775
I'm here to see detective Murdoch.

25:07.606 --> 25:10.177
Which suggests other dimensions,

25:10.208 --> 25:11.243
invisible to us

25:11.276 --> 25:13.449
but lying as close as
the surface of our skin is

25:13.512 --> 25:15.287
to the air above it.

25:15.347 --> 25:19.227
And it all worked, except for
one troubling inconsistency.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.525
What was that?

25:20.552 --> 25:22.725
These equations led to infinities

25:22.754 --> 25:24.199
within a finite space.

25:24.222 --> 25:27.260
I was crushed, naturally.

25:27.292 --> 25:28.600
Then it hit me.

25:28.627 --> 25:31.972
What if time and space were
folded in upon themselves?

25:32.030 --> 25:35.409
You know, like the pages of a book.

25:35.433 --> 25:38.243
And if these folds lay
closely enough together-

25:38.270 --> 25:39.772
- with sufficient harmonic energy,

25:39.804 --> 25:41.647
one could bridge one point in time

25:41.706 --> 25:42.878
with another.

25:44.976 --> 25:47.115
What are they talking about, sir?

25:47.145 --> 25:48.886
Haven't the foggiest, Crabtree,

25:48.914 --> 25:50.621
but whatever it is, I'm not buying it.

25:50.649 --> 25:53.653
Sir, if a time machine exists,

25:53.718 --> 25:56.426
then the attempt on Seth
Morgan's life was real.

25:56.454 --> 25:57.660
Time machine or not,

25:57.722 --> 26:00.566
a man was almost shot in a Toronto street.

26:00.592 --> 26:02.765
He said the lads found this
at the bottom of a coal chute.

26:02.794 --> 26:05.172
Yes, sir. When I fell, he got ahead of me.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.641
He must have escaped down the chute

26:06.665 --> 26:08.838
seconds before I arrived.

26:08.900 --> 26:12.109
If the man wearing this
slid down the chute,

26:12.137 --> 26:14.981
the stains would be
streaked all down one side.

26:15.006 --> 26:16.986
These are in patches all over.

26:17.008 --> 26:18.048
What are you suggesting?

26:18.076 --> 26:20.147
Santa didn't slide down the chimney.

26:20.178 --> 26:21.486
This is a decoy suit.

26:21.513 --> 26:24.357
So, what, our shooter
was wearing a second suit?

26:24.416 --> 26:27.693
And waited in hiding for us to
discover the suit he planted,

26:27.752 --> 26:29.493
making us all believe he'd disappeared.

26:29.521 --> 26:32.365
Sir, that's a very Murdochian observation,

26:32.424 --> 26:33.368
if I may say.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.996
Murdoch's not the only copper
in this station, Crabtree.

26:36.027 --> 26:38.803
Get your coat.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.609
Check that side, Crabtree?

26:43.635 --> 26:47.139
So, sir, if this time machine
is just a big swindle...

26:47.172 --> 26:48.812
Well, then, whoever was wearing the suit

26:48.840 --> 26:51.514
was part of that swindle.

26:51.543 --> 26:53.489
If we can find out who's
behind the shooting,

26:53.511 --> 26:55.491
we'll be one step closer to proving it.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.119
Try that one.

27:11.663 --> 27:13.233
As you can see, we found a partial print

27:13.298 --> 27:16.836
on the button of the
second Santa suit here.

27:16.868 --> 27:18.745
George, based on the size,

27:18.803 --> 27:21.579
Ä± suspect that this
is a partial thumbprint.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.211
Take a photograph of
this as well as the print

27:24.242 --> 27:26.347
we lifted from the shell casing.

27:26.378 --> 27:27.755
See how the two compare.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.223
Sir. Will do.

27:29.247 --> 27:30.726
Hello, William.

27:30.749 --> 27:33.093
I understand you've been to the future.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.154
But, William,

27:36.187 --> 27:39.066
time travel violates
every principle of logic.

27:39.090 --> 27:40.433
Perhaps,

27:40.492 --> 27:43.564
but Professor Harms makes a
compelling mathematical case.

27:43.595 --> 27:46.542
How does he explain the numerous paradoxes?

27:46.564 --> 27:50.341
He speculates there may
be more than one future.

27:50.368 --> 27:53.872
Every atom, every molecule duplicated?

27:53.905 --> 27:55.248
I know it sounds absurd,

27:55.273 --> 27:58.880
but the laws of physics remain unviolated.

27:58.910 --> 28:01.288
But what about the law of conservation?

28:01.346 --> 28:04.020
You say you saw yourself in the future.

28:04.049 --> 28:06.427
That means that there were
two of you in one space.

28:06.451 --> 28:08.795
Matter was created.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.696
In fact, if every time
you traveled to the future,

28:10.722 --> 28:13.635
you arrived one minute
prior to the time before,

28:13.692 --> 28:17.401
you could theoretically
populate a city with yourself.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.234
Perhaps matter wasn't created

28:21.266 --> 28:23.041
so much as it was simply borrowed.

28:23.068 --> 28:24.206
Borrowed?

28:24.235 --> 28:26.272
Well, as long as your body
was in one future state,

28:26.304 --> 28:28.648
it was necessarily not in another.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.482
Perhaps the laws of conservation only hold

28:30.542 --> 28:33.079
across all possible future states.

28:33.111 --> 28:37.059
Or perhaps the laws of physics are wrong.

28:37.082 --> 28:38.720
The only thing that is certain...

28:40.151 --> 28:41.824
How long have they been at it?

28:41.886 --> 28:44.594
Over an hour, sir.

28:44.622 --> 28:46.624
Bloody hell.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.731
Get me the lunatic asylum.

28:54.432 --> 28:57.902
So detective Murdoch said
he's been to the future?

28:57.936 --> 28:59.313
That he did.

29:01.272 --> 29:04.651
Did he say if they invented a
machine to match finger marks?

29:04.676 --> 29:06.849
Henry, no machine will ever take the place

29:06.911 --> 29:08.948
of the keen eye of the policeman.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.084
We'll get to it.

29:10.115 --> 29:11.526
By new year's, I hope.

29:13.318 --> 29:16.492
Speaking of new year's, did
Dr. grace accept your offer?

29:17.489 --> 29:19.469
I haven't offered my offer yet.

29:19.491 --> 29:20.697
'Cause she's avoiding you?

29:20.759 --> 29:23.797
George, she comes from a better class.

29:23.828 --> 29:25.136
All her friends do.

29:25.163 --> 29:26.870
Henry, sometimes I think
you want me to remain

29:26.931 --> 29:29.002
a miserable bachelor like yourself.

29:29.033 --> 29:31.013
I have a date to the ball.

29:32.971 --> 29:34.644
George, you're not even
comparing the photograph

29:34.672 --> 29:35.946
to the finger marks.

29:35.974 --> 29:37.351
Henry, I've seen it 100 times.

29:37.375 --> 29:39.095
I have that finger mark
committed to memory.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.555
I'll be dreaming of that finger mark

29:40.612 --> 29:42.114
in my sleep tonight.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.388
And you're wrong about Dr. Grace.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.328
She is a modern woman,
and in the new century,

29:47.352 --> 29:49.730
relationships will be defined
by a meeting of the minds,

29:49.788 --> 29:52.860
and I, my friend, am a 20th-century man.

29:56.327 --> 29:57.670
George.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.535
Dr. Grace.

30:01.566 --> 30:03.341
Emily.

30:03.368 --> 30:06.406
I'm wondering of you would do
me the honor of accompanying me

30:06.471 --> 30:09.213
to the new year's policeman's ball?

30:09.240 --> 30:13.552
Oh, George, I'm afraid I've
already made plans with friends.

30:13.578 --> 30:15.057
You're welcome to join us, though.

30:15.079 --> 30:16.422
I'm sure you'd like them.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.653
No, no, that's fine.

30:17.682 --> 30:19.252
You have a wonderful time, though.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.990
You too.

30:31.362 --> 30:34.775
Inspector Brackenreid's
call was hardly necessary.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.779
He's concerned your trip to the future

30:36.835 --> 30:38.678
is a psychotic delusion.

30:38.703 --> 30:40.774
Is that possible?

30:40.839 --> 30:44.912
Yes, although it would
require full-blown psychosis,

30:44.943 --> 30:47.423
which you've shown no
symptoms to this point.

30:48.746 --> 30:49.724
Ah.

30:49.747 --> 30:50.725
Oh, my goodness.

30:50.748 --> 30:52.750
Oh. Uh, George?

30:52.784 --> 30:56.231
George, could you please get
the doctor a rag or something?

30:57.722 --> 31:00.032
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

31:00.058 --> 31:02.868
Thank you, George.

31:02.894 --> 31:05.875
Goodness.

31:05.897 --> 31:08.434
Have you spoken to any of
the other travelers yet?

31:08.466 --> 31:10.070
Some.

31:10.101 --> 31:12.775
And they appear sane as you and I.

31:12.804 --> 31:16.081
It seems to lead to only one conclusion.

31:16.107 --> 31:19.486
Professor harms' machine works.

31:21.312 --> 31:23.223
What do you think?

31:23.248 --> 31:25.922
Dr. Roberts isn't doing much
to dissuade the detective.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.122
Bloody hell.

31:27.151 --> 31:30.291
Crabtree, get Higgins to
fetch that Turner fellow.

31:30.321 --> 31:32.733
And bring in Professor Harms' solicitor.

31:32.757 --> 31:34.134
To what end, sir?

31:34.158 --> 31:35.933
- To do what we should have
done in the first place:

31:35.960 --> 31:37.962
Follow the sodding money.

31:40.798 --> 31:42.334
So tell me about this trust, then.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.778
It's completely legal.

31:44.802 --> 31:48.306
All monies collected as payment
for voyages to the future

31:48.339 --> 31:51.650
are to be deposited in a trust account

31:51.676 --> 31:54.088
which is devoted entirely to
the operation and maintenance

31:54.112 --> 31:55.682
of the time machine,

31:55.747 --> 31:57.818
as long as the funds last.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.419
How long is that?

31:59.450 --> 32:03.296
At the moment, 112 years.

32:03.321 --> 32:05.198
Mr. Denman,

32:05.256 --> 32:06.792
you're telling me that Professor harms

32:06.824 --> 32:08.531
raised all this money to pay someone

32:08.593 --> 32:10.800
to keep the lights running
through to the next millennium?

32:10.828 --> 32:12.364
Essentially, yes.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.467
And Professor Harms
himself has no access to it?

32:14.499 --> 32:16.308
None whatsoever.

32:16.334 --> 32:17.938
The money led nowhere.

32:17.969 --> 32:19.949
Where are we with the
finger marks of the shooter?

32:19.971 --> 32:21.006
No matches yet, sir.

32:21.039 --> 32:22.313
Care to join us, Murdoch?

32:25.510 --> 32:27.183
Have you found something new, sir?

32:27.211 --> 32:29.384
Do I need to remind you that
this is your case as well?

32:29.447 --> 32:30.391
Sirs-

32:30.448 --> 32:32.394
- unlike you, I haven't been
fooled by a bloody con man.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.192
Sir, Professor Harms and
Mr. Turner are not con men.

32:35.219 --> 32:37.221
- Sirs!
- What is it, Higgins?

32:37.288 --> 32:38.494
We found Mr. Turner.

32:38.523 --> 32:39.558
Where is he?

32:39.624 --> 32:41.626
In the morgue, sir.

32:46.364 --> 32:48.810
His body was found in the don river, sir.

32:48.833 --> 32:50.642
That makes sense.

32:50.668 --> 32:52.909
There are signs of
exposure on Turner's body:

32:52.971 --> 32:55.315
His face, hands, and feet are frostbitten,

32:55.340 --> 32:57.047
and he has skin damage.

32:57.075 --> 32:59.988
This doesn't make sense.

33:00.011 --> 33:01.684
I examined all his organs

33:01.713 --> 33:04.387
and found that his kidney
was partially frozen.

33:04.415 --> 33:05.723
Frozen?

33:05.750 --> 33:07.855
Yes, and not only his kidney.

33:07.885 --> 33:11.196
All his organs show signs
of having been frozen solid.

33:11.222 --> 33:13.566
But the temperature has been above freezing

33:13.591 --> 33:14.729
for the past few days.

33:14.759 --> 33:17.000
I myself just saw him yesterday.

33:17.028 --> 33:19.565
Perhaps Turner sent himself into the past,

33:19.597 --> 33:22.043
and he's been dead for weeks, not days.

33:23.234 --> 33:26.215
That was a joke, Murdoch. I was joking.

34:00.938 --> 34:02.281
Sirs!

34:02.306 --> 34:03.614
What is it?

34:03.641 --> 34:05.120
I found a match for the cartridge

34:05.143 --> 34:06.816
and the Santa suit button.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.255
Who is it?

34:08.279 --> 34:09.882
It's Dr. Roberts.

34:09.914 --> 34:12.621
Dr. Roberts? Are you quite sure, George?

34:12.650 --> 34:14.152
Quite, sir.

34:14.217 --> 34:15.594
What the bloody hell is he doing

34:15.620 --> 34:18.293
dressing up as Santa Claus
and taking potshots at people?

34:18.322 --> 34:22.464
George, have Dr. Ogden
meet me at the asylum.

34:22.493 --> 34:24.768
Good bit of police work there, Crabtree.

34:30.501 --> 34:31.980
He does have a fatal condition.

34:32.003 --> 34:35.313
Perhaps he's become somewhat unhinged.

34:35.339 --> 34:37.341
That's possible.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.951
What's this device?

34:41.978 --> 34:45.016
This is the experimental
therapy I mentioned.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.824
The cap is placed over the patient's head.

34:47.851 --> 34:48.956
Then an electric current

34:48.985 --> 34:50.966
is passed through the temporal lobes.

34:50.987 --> 34:53.025
Inducing an instant seizure.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.128
Yes, which makes the patient susceptible

34:55.159 --> 34:56.797
to hypnotic suggestion.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.137
Professor Harms.

35:04.168 --> 35:06.774
Perhaps he's gone to the future, sir.

35:06.804 --> 35:09.045
Well, if he has, he isn't coming back.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.131
You have a son.

35:24.155 --> 35:26.795
He is eight years old.

35:26.824 --> 35:28.462
He is very excited to see you.

35:28.493 --> 35:30.495
See you when I'm born.

35:33.731 --> 35:36.075
I was never there.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.375
All foolish fantasy.

35:58.523 --> 36:01.595
Ah, an identical room.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.172
It's all smoke and mirrors, me old mucker.

36:23.214 --> 36:25.216
Bloody hell.

36:32.957 --> 36:34.937
Dr. Roberts.

36:34.959 --> 36:36.939
Sir, what is it?

36:41.899 --> 36:45.642
Please, don't touch him.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.774
He's not dead.

36:47.805 --> 36:49.716
He looks bloody dead to me.

36:49.740 --> 36:52.414
He is not.

36:52.443 --> 36:54.650
He's been frozen alive.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.659
I immersed him in liquid nitrogen.

36:57.715 --> 37:00.059
It was the only way to save him.

37:00.084 --> 37:03.327
We watched our father die of the disease.

37:03.387 --> 37:06.664
I wasn't prepared to see
him suffer the same fate.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.227
- You were brothers?
- Stepbrothers.

37:09.260 --> 37:12.332
So you're not afflicted by the disease?

37:12.396 --> 37:13.898
You're hoping that someone in the future

37:13.931 --> 37:17.174
can revive him and cure him.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.442
This is what you're raising money for.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.177
The time machine was all a hoax.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.185
Oh, not at the beginning.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.914
But when I couldn't make it work,

37:24.942 --> 37:28.754
I had to find a way to
finance this cryogenic chamber.

37:28.779 --> 37:30.520
So you, Mr. Turner, and Dr. Roberts

37:30.581 --> 37:32.527
constructed these elaborate scenarios

37:32.583 --> 37:33.755
to make it appear as though.

37:33.784 --> 37:36.094
Mr. Turner traveled to the future.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.464
The attempted suicide,
the shooting, the boy,

37:38.489 --> 37:39.934
they were all part of it.

37:39.957 --> 37:42.699
I had to try to save my brother.

37:42.760 --> 37:46.207
Reanimation from a
frozen state is possible.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.369
I experimented with goldfish.

37:48.432 --> 37:51.811
I froze them and thawed them.

37:51.836 --> 37:52.940
They came back to life.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.313
A fish is hardly a person.

37:54.338 --> 37:56.682
He's my brother. What choice did I have?

37:56.707 --> 37:58.687
And people's visions of the future?

37:58.709 --> 38:01.349
Post-hypnotic suggestion.

38:01.379 --> 38:02.881
We didn't mean to hurt anyone.

38:02.947 --> 38:03.982
Really?

38:04.015 --> 38:06.894
Then how did Turner end up
melting in a bloody ditch?

38:06.951 --> 38:10.660
We needed to test the thawing process.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.065
We couldn't revive him.

38:12.123 --> 38:15.127
He wanted to do this.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.502
I swear.

38:16.527 --> 38:18.234
He wanted to be a hero.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.367
Your brother took advantage of him.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.537
If that's not murder,
then it's bloody close.

38:22.566 --> 38:24.341
I've half a mind to thaw him out right now.

38:24.368 --> 38:27.212
Leave him!

38:27.238 --> 38:29.809
If you unplug the machine, he will die.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.218
I take the responsibility for our actions.

38:32.243 --> 38:35.690
Sir, it's not up to us to play God.

38:35.713 --> 38:36.987
So we just leave him?

38:37.014 --> 38:40.860
If it works, he'll live
much longer than we will.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.007
Godspeed.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.549
When Dr. Roberts hypnotized you,

39:04.575 --> 39:06.248
what did you see?

39:06.277 --> 39:08.018
Oh, it doesn't matter.

39:08.045 --> 39:09.718
It was all in my imagination.

39:09.747 --> 39:13.559
But what did you imagine?

39:13.584 --> 39:16.861
The world as I would want it to be.

39:16.887 --> 39:19.458
It's a pity it wasn't true.

39:19.523 --> 39:23.061
I would love to live in a future
imagined by William Murdoch.

39:28.599 --> 39:31.307
I should go.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.746
Happy new year, William.

39:32.770 --> 39:35.649
Yes, happy new year, Julia.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.721
Sir.

39:48.753 --> 39:51.290
George?

39:51.322 --> 39:54.326
Shouldn't you be attending
the new year's celebration?

39:54.392 --> 39:55.928
Uh...

39:55.960 --> 39:57.997
I'm not sure I'm attending the party, sir.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.906
Isn't Dr. Grace expecting you?

40:00.931 --> 40:04.242
She's going to another,
more high-class do.

40:04.268 --> 40:06.839
She invited me to attend, but...

40:06.904 --> 40:11.410
George, Dr. Grace invited you to a party,

40:11.442 --> 40:13.422
and you don't plan on attending?

40:13.444 --> 40:14.855
I just don't think I would belong, sir.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.687
It's-

40:16.747 --> 40:18.590
what about you? Are you going to the ball?

40:18.616 --> 40:21.028
No. No, I wasn't planning on it.

40:26.524 --> 40:30.597
George, the new century
deserves to be marked.

40:32.096 --> 40:35.543
Might I suggest that you and I
attend the celebration together?

40:54.452 --> 40:56.398
We were to be there half an hour ago.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.491
I'm hurrying.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.001
Damn it.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.843
You don't want to do this, do you?

41:13.871 --> 41:17.216
I'm happy to go to the Lamonte' party.

41:17.241 --> 41:19.653
That's not what I meant.

41:19.677 --> 41:21.350
It's the Eve of a new century.

41:21.378 --> 41:23.153
It is.

41:24.915 --> 41:27.589
I think you should be with
whom you wish when it begins.

42:20.404 --> 42:23.283
Uh, sir.

42:23.307 --> 42:24.650
What are you two gawking at?

42:24.708 --> 42:27.985
Sir, just taking in
station number 4's prowess

42:28.045 --> 42:30.047
on the dance floor.

42:32.416 --> 42:34.396
How's your packing coming along?

42:34.418 --> 42:36.261
I'm not going anywhere.

42:36.287 --> 42:37.664
I've changed my mind, Murdoch.

42:37.721 --> 42:39.325
Sitting behind a desk in Ottawa

42:39.390 --> 42:41.666
is no place for Thomas s. Brackenreid.

42:41.725 --> 42:45.172
Besides, you lot couldn't
cope without me for a day.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.607
Oh, sir, truer words were never spoken.

42:47.631 --> 42:50.271
Less of your insolence, Crabtree.

42:50.301 --> 42:51.678
Bloody hell.

42:51.735 --> 42:53.806
Where'd Higgins get a
bit of fluff like that?

42:53.837 --> 42:55.942
He's definitely punching above his weight.

42:58.175 --> 42:59.153
Welcome back, sir.

42:59.176 --> 43:00.917
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.

43:00.945 --> 43:01.946
Sir.

43:08.018 --> 43:10.498
George...

43:20.831 --> 43:23.107
Dr. Grace, what brings you here?

43:23.133 --> 43:24.476
You do, George.

43:24.501 --> 43:25.844
Me?

43:25.869 --> 43:28.179
Well, I thought you had
a party with your friends.

43:28.205 --> 43:30.811
None of my friends are
quite as stimulating as you.

43:30.841 --> 43:33.219
Shall we get a drink?

43:33.277 --> 43:34.779
Yes, absolutely.

43:34.812 --> 43:37.156
Maybe we could squeeze in a
dance before the fireworks.

43:37.181 --> 43:38.489
That sounds most splendid.

43:38.515 --> 43:40.017
To refuse that promotion

43:40.050 --> 43:41.620
is probably the most ridiculous thing

43:41.652 --> 43:43.393
that you have ever done.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.058
Sir, it's New Year's Eve.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.898
I don't see what that has to do with it.

43:47.958 --> 43:51.167
Well, I'm about to dance with my wife,

43:51.195 --> 43:52.833
so if you don't mind...

43:52.863 --> 43:54.865
Thank you, sir.

44:44.181 --> 44:46.183
Julia.

44:46.216 --> 44:47.786
Hello, William.

44:49.853 --> 44:51.457
It's quite the turnout.

44:51.522 --> 44:52.557
Yes.

44:52.589 --> 44:54.694
All these policemen.

44:54.725 --> 44:56.466
It would be a good night to commit a crime.

45:01.932 --> 45:03.434
William...

45:03.467 --> 45:05.447
I wanted to let you know...

45:07.805 --> 45:10.445
That I intend to become a psychiatrist.

45:12.576 --> 45:13.646
Oh.

45:13.711 --> 45:14.917
Yes, just think of it:

45:14.945 --> 45:16.549
The application of psychology

45:16.580 --> 45:19.322
to the puzzles you're faced with.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.727
It could be invaluable.

45:21.752 --> 45:26.633
I can envision a whole new
field of criminal investigation.

45:26.657 --> 45:29.331
Take the case of Mr. Turner.

45:29.393 --> 45:32.067
I should have seen that he was in fact-

45:32.096 --> 45:33.734
Julia.

45:33.764 --> 45:36.244
You came her tonight to tell me that?

45:37.735 --> 45:39.942
Yes, I-I thought that...

45:42.272 --> 45:44.081
Darcy and I have parted.

45:44.108 --> 45:45.109
And I want you to know

45:45.142 --> 45:46.985
that I don't expect
anything from you, William,

45:47.010 --> 45:50.355
but we could work together.

45:50.414 --> 45:53.520
Perhaps we could discover
the psychological profile

45:53.584 --> 45:56.497
of someone who would be most
likely to commit a crime.

45:56.520 --> 45:58.625
You and Darcy have parted?

46:00.624 --> 46:02.626
Yes.

46:06.864 --> 46:11.210
Julia, I have seen the future.

46:11.268 --> 46:13.270
William'?

46:14.671 --> 46:16.150
It was you.

46:35.959 --> 46:37.961
Happy New Year.
