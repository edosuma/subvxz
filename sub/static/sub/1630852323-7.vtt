<i>can't have similar businesses</i>
<i>and be friends.</i>

04:16.381 --> 04:20.510
<i>I think that there's enough for everyone</i>
<i>and that, like, if she wants to do that--</i>

04:20.593 --> 04:24.681

<i>there's nothing wrong with her going out,</i>

<i>-Mmm-mmm.</i>
<i>-I feel… rejuvenated.</i>

18:25.479 --> 18:26.396
<i>[all exclaim]</i>

18:26.480 --> 18:28.941
<i>-[Rena] Why's that?</i>
<i>-[Alexis] Oh, wait, oh, Lord.</i>

18:29.483 --> 18:31.360
<i>But self love is the best love, honey.</i>

18:31.443 --> 18:32.986
<i>Who else won the gifts?</i>

18:33.070 --> 18:36.740
<i>Colony.</i>
<i>She just bought vibrating panties, honey.</i>

18:36.824 --> 18:40.869
<i>Right. No, that one was</i>
<i>definitely, like, new to me.</i>

18:40.953 --> 18:42.454
<i>I had never seen…</i>

18:42.538 --> 18:46.625
<i>Specifically that compartment,</i>
<i>it fit in so nicely.</i>

18:46.708 --> 18:49.628
<i>-I thought that's where you put money.</i>
<i>-The underwear you can slip a tip in.</i>

18:49.711 --> 18:52.548
<i>Too close for comfort</i>
<i>for the tip to be right there.</i>

18:52.631 --> 18:53.590
<i>That all makes sense.</i>

18:55.634 --> 18:58.178
<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

18:59.596 --> 19:00.764
<i>[Denim] Don't hold my hand.</i>

19:00.848 --> 19:03.600
<i>Oh, you a big boy?</i>
<i>You don't want me holding your hands?</i>

19:07.020 --> 19:08.522
<i>I'mma do the orange creamsicle.</i>

19:08.605 --> 19:10.107
<i>-Can I have that too?</i>
<i>-[man] Yeah.</i>

19:10.190 --> 19:12.526
<i>[Sharelle] Denim,</i>
<i>what flavor ice cream do you want?</i>

19:12.609 --> 19:13.652
<i>I want vanilla.</i>

19:14.153 --> 19:16.697
<i>-[Sharelle] You want it in a cone?</i>
<i>-Mmm-hmm.</i>

19:16.780 --> 19:17.781
<i>What do you say?</i>

19:17.865 --> 19:19.283
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:21.076 --> 19:22.161
<i>Hi, ladies.</i>

19:22.244 --> 19:23.412
<i>-[Alexis] Hi.</i>
<i>-[Anne] Hello.</i>

19:23.495 --> 19:24.788
<i>Ooh, she comes bearing gifts.</i>

19:24.872 --> 19:26.498
<i>-[Karla] Thank you.</i>
<i>-Some treats, pastries.</i>

19:26.582 --> 19:28.208
<i>-[Tennille] You need some help?</i>
<i>-Yes, girl.</i>

19:28.292 --> 19:31.003
<i>I figured you'd be hungover</i>
<i>from Juawana's party last night.</i>

19:31.086 --> 19:32.171
<i>[overlapping chatter]</i>

19:32.254 --> 19:34.798
<i>[Tennille] I am also hungover-rejuvenated.</i>

19:34.882 --> 19:37.759
<i>[Colony] Sharelle and Juawana</i>
<i>are missing out today, y'all.</i>

19:37.843 --> 19:40.429
<i>Somebody need to call and</i>
<i>check on Juawana. That thing was huge.</i>

19:40.512 --> 19:44.099
<i>Girl, that's probably why she's not</i>
<i>in the office, because she's torn up.</i>

19:44.183 --> 19:46.602
<i>Right-- Not torn up, Anne!</i>

19:46.685 --> 19:48.478
<i>[Anne] Tennille, how do you use it?</i>

19:49.730 --> 19:50.939
<i>[Karla] Wait a minute.</i>

19:51.023 --> 19:53.150
<i>[Tennille] Why you</i>
<i>think I know how to use it?</i>

19:53.233 --> 19:55.527
<i>I haven't been with a horse.</i>
<i>Did you see that thing?</i>

19:55.611 --> 19:56.695
<i>[Anne] It was pretty big.</i>

19:56.778 --> 20:00.032
<i>We need to ask the woman</i>
<i>who's been married the longest.</i>

20:00.115 --> 20:02.326
<i>Okay, 'cause I know she got some tricks.</i>

20:02.409 --> 20:06.038
<i>I been married long for a reason,</i>
<i>and it's not sharing stuff with y'all.</i>

20:06.121 --> 20:08.165
<i>[all exclaiming]</i>

20:08.248 --> 20:12.377
<i>-All I will say is, I left my wig on.</i>
<i>-[Colony] She left the wig on.</i>

20:12.461 --> 20:15.297
<i>-She probably woke up to breakfast in bed.</i>
<i>-[Colony] Wow.</i>

20:15.380 --> 20:17.341
<i>Sharelle dropped the bomb</i>
<i>on us last night.</i>

20:17.424 --> 20:18.383
<i>[all] She did.</i>

20:18.467 --> 20:19.801
<i>-[Colony] Right?</i>
<i>-I was so shocked.</i>

20:19.885 --> 20:22.554
<i>[Tennille] I can believe it, what you</i>
<i>think you do when you have sex?</i>

20:23.555 --> 20:26.016
<i>When she touched her stomach,</i>
<i>I was like, "Oh!"</i>

20:26.099 --> 20:27.976
<i>And then she starts to… I said…</i>

20:28.644 --> 20:30.979
<i>And then she started crying. Oh, my God.</i>

20:31.563 --> 20:33.023
<i>I never saw this coming.</i>

20:33.106 --> 20:36.109
<i>The only thing that I noticed</i>
<i>was her butt getting bigger.</i>

20:36.193 --> 20:39.071
<i>I just thought she was</i>
<i>having a good life, I don't know.</i>

20:39.154 --> 20:43.492
<i>She looks like she's glowing, I'm looking</i>
<i>at her and I'm like, "I can see it now."</i>

20:43.575 --> 20:45.953
<i>How'd I miss the signs, you know?</i>

20:46.036 --> 20:49.248
<i>[Colony] That damn Sharelle.</i>
<i>She can keep a secret.</i>

20:50.457 --> 20:51.291
<i>[Arieana] Denim.</i>

20:51.375 --> 20:52.834
<i>You got a milk-stache.</i>

20:55.629 --> 20:56.797
<i>Denim, guess what.</i>

20:57.381 --> 20:58.548
<i>Denim and Arieana.</i>

20:59.258 --> 21:01.051
<i>Mommy will be expecting,</i>

21:01.134 --> 21:04.263
<i>and y'all may be having</i>
<i>another brother or sister.</i>

21:04.346 --> 21:07.849
<i>I knew it! I seen a pregnancy test.</i>

21:08.892 --> 21:10.560
<i>Where you saw the pregnancy test at?</i>

21:10.644 --> 21:14.314
<i>-In your drawer, but I didn't say nothing.</i>
<i>-[Denim] I saw it too.</i>

21:14.398 --> 21:16.858
<i>You don't even know</i>
<i>what a pregnancy test look like.</i>

21:16.942 --> 21:18.944
<i>I do. I saw on my phone.</i>

21:19.027 --> 21:22.155
<i>-Siri told me, I asked Siri!</i>
<i>-Siri told you?</i>

21:22.239 --> 21:24.074
<i>-You asked Siri what?</i>
<i>-I asked Siri.</i>

21:24.908 --> 21:27.661
<i>-Did you understand what Mommy said?</i>
<i>-What?</i>

21:27.744 --> 21:29.454
<i>Mommy is pregnant.</i>

21:29.538 --> 21:32.124
<i>Mommy's gonna have your brother or sister.</i>

21:32.207 --> 21:35.627
<i>Are you happy?</i>
<i>You're not gonna be the baby anymore.</i>

21:38.672 --> 21:39.506
<i>Are you joking?</i>

21:41.133 --> 21:42.134
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

21:43.218 --> 21:45.846
<i>They're not sleeping in my room.</i>

21:45.929 --> 21:47.764
<i>They're gonna pee in the bed.</i>

21:47.848 --> 21:48.849
<i>Are you happy?</i>

21:49.641 --> 21:50.976
<i>Yes, I'm happy for you.</i>

21:51.059 --> 21:52.811
<i>Aww, Ari.</i>

21:52.894 --> 21:54.896
<i>I thought you wasn't gonna accept it.</i>

21:54.980 --> 21:57.858
<i>You gonna love this baby.</i>
<i>Just like you love Denim.</i>

21:57.941 --> 22:00.068
<i>Yes, I love Denim, he's just bad!</i>

22:00.152 --> 22:01.820
<i>[Sharelle laughing]</i>

22:01.903 --> 22:05.490
<i>What's gonna happen?</i>
<i>Is she staying here, is she…</i>

22:05.574 --> 22:07.659
<i>-[Alexis] I would assume she'd move.</i>
<i>-Moving to Miami?</i>

22:07.743 --> 22:09.077
<i>-[Anne] Uh-oh.</i>
<i>-Right?</i>

22:09.161 --> 22:13.498
<i>She's gonna have to move. There's no way</i>
<i>he's gonna want to be without his baby.</i>

22:14.041 --> 22:16.251
<i>Why does she have to move?</i>
<i>He needs to move here.</i>

22:16.335 --> 22:17.794
<i>[Colony] Her life is here, so…</i>

22:17.878 --> 22:19.921
<i>-Yeah, we need her.</i>
<i>-[Rena] Her brokerage is here.</i>

22:20.005 --> 22:24.051
<i>-Hello, we are here. Us.</i>
<i>-[Rena] More importantly.</i>

22:24.801 --> 22:28.180
<i>Denim, since school is out,</i>
<i>do you wanna go to Miami with Mommy?</i>

22:28.263 --> 22:29.973
<i>You wanna go to Chad's house?</i>

22:31.266 --> 22:35.354
<i>Well, there's a chance</i>
<i>that we might relocate to Miami.</i>

22:37.689 --> 22:38.648
<i>I don't know.</i>

22:39.316 --> 22:41.193
<i>I don't really like that idea.</i>

22:41.276 --> 22:43.320
<i>I don't like Miami</i>

22:43.403 --> 22:46.031
<i>'cause I don't know nobody down there.</i>

22:48.283 --> 22:49.534
<i>You don't wanna leave here?</i>

22:51.787 --> 22:53.497
<i>What's wrong? You're tearing up.</i>

22:54.081 --> 22:57.167
<i>Because I just don't like meeting people.</i>

22:59.586 --> 23:01.630
<i>-[crying]</i>
<i>-Gimme a hug, baby.</i>

23:01.713 --> 23:02.714
<i>It's gonna be all right.</i>

23:04.091 --> 23:06.468
<i>-I love you.</i>
<i>-I love you too.</i>

23:06.551 --> 23:10.722
<i>I know you're gonna be a great role model</i>
<i>to your little brother or sister.</i>

23:10.806 --> 23:12.265
<i>Pinky promise.</i>

23:15.352 --> 23:18.855
<i>And we'll talk about relocation.</i>
<i>I still haven't decided yet.</i>

23:18.939 --> 23:20.190
<i>It's just thoughts.</i>

23:21.817 --> 23:22.734
<i>Okay?</i>

23:24.069 --> 23:29.866
<i>[Rena] So if Sharelle goes to Miami,</i>
<i>what does that mean for the Tampa office?</i>

23:31.993 --> 23:33.120
<i>[Colony] I don't know, y'all.</i>

23:35.122 --> 23:37.916
<i>Do you guys think Juawana's</i>
<i>gonna be running the show now?</i>

23:41.378 --> 23:43.422
<i>[tense music playing]</i>

23:46.925 --> 23:48.927
<i>[tense music fading]</i>

23:51.805 --> 23:54.683
<i>[Rena] I love it.</i>
<i>This is a home run, Russ. Thank you.</i>

23:54.766 --> 23:57.144
<i>-You did a fantastic job.</i>
<i>-My pleasure. Take it for a spin.</i>

23:57.227 --> 23:59.479
<i>-[Rena] Okay.</i>
<i>-That's the boss chair.</i>

23:59.563 --> 24:00.939
<i>-[Rena] Is it now?</i>
<i>-Oh, wow.</i>

24:02.232 --> 24:05.152
<i>It really does check all of the boxes.</i>

24:05.235 --> 24:06.695
<i>Let's talk business.</i>

24:06.778 --> 24:09.573
<i>$8,000 a month. That's it.</i>

24:10.991 --> 24:12.492
<i>Okay, is that negotiable?</i>

24:13.743 --> 24:15.120
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

24:17.205 --> 24:19.499
<i>This actually looks like Sharelle's chair,</i>
<i>but in leather.</i>

24:21.460 --> 24:23.378
<i>You look like you're</i>
<i>ready to take over the world.</i>

24:23.462 --> 24:26.131
<i>-Thank you, I just might.</i>
