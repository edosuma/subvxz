I promise Mommy will get as sick
as you like on the honeymoon.

There's my angel.

Is something wrong?

Susan, sweetheart,

do you have cold feet?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.458
There's no shame if you do.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.001
No. No, I don't.

You're sure you don't?

I'm sure.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.714
Okay, but it'd be really fine if you did.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.758
What? What are you saying?

00:49.841 --> 00:54.054
I'll give you a thousand dollars

I'm sorry, Mr. Durkin,

you know, "the boom in your womb"?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.060
I knew it!

11:26.143 --> 11:28.479
-Didn't I?
-Yes, you did.

11:28.562 --> 11:33.150
On the drive down,
he pulled over to stop at a wishing well.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.985
I'm not getting a divorce!

11:36.904 --> 11:40.241
When Frank's dad died,
they left so many things unsaid.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.743
I just don't want that to happen to us.

11:42.827 --> 11:47.665
Oh, Susan, aren't you darling?

11:47.748 --> 11:50.584
[chuckles] We have no issues between us.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.044
Daddy hates Frank!

11:52.128 --> 11:53.337
You always have.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.172
Not always.

11:55.256 --> 11:59.176
Just since the first moment
I laid eyes on the worthless bastard.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.971
[kissing sounds]

12:04.640 --> 12:07.476
I'm glad you're over your funk
and feeling better.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.479
Yeah, you like it when I'm not crying,
don't ya?

12:10.563 --> 12:12.231
[man] Alice? Alice, are you in there?

12:12.314 --> 12:14.024
Oh no, it's my dad!

12:14.108 --> 12:16.193
What's he doing home
in the middle of the day?

12:16.277 --> 12:17.695
Does he have cancer or something?

12:17.778 --> 12:19.822
Peanut, listen,
I... I'm so sorry to bother you,

12:19.905 --> 12:21.282
but my pen ran out of ink.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.242
Well, who do we have here?

12:23.325 --> 12:26.287
-I wasn't doing anything!
-Ah, you must be Kevin!

12:26.370 --> 12:28.664
[chuckles] Dr. Erwin Goldman.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.750
Alice says wonderful things about you.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.836
-Dad, stop.
-I-- I still wasn't doing anything.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.796
There's no need for pretense.

12:35.880 --> 12:40.968
I was young once, back when
the Dead Sea was just sick. [chuckles]

12:41.051 --> 12:42.344
[chuckles nervously]

12:42.970 --> 12:45.347
[Dr. Goldman]
You both have healthy teenage urges,

12:45.431 --> 12:50.102
but I think you're still a little young
to be fully exploring your sexuality.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.022
Perhaps we could go back to my office
and have a group encounter about--

12:53.105 --> 12:55.816
Oh, you're so embarrassing!

12:55.900 --> 12:59.111
You left me
in the middle of our session, Dr. G!

12:59.195 --> 13:02.406
I was gonna make a breakthrough,
but you blew it!

13:02.490 --> 13:05.868
Anything I do from here on out is on you.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.621
-Oh, who's this fucking dink?
-Eat me.

13:08.704 --> 13:09.789
Maybe I will.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.374
Uh, wait in my office, Jeffrey.
I'll be with you shortly.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.959
Mmm.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.421
Kevin, would you care to stay for dinner?
I'm making coq au vin.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.174
-Sure, I'm really good at eating dinner.
-Splendid.

13:20.257 --> 13:23.302
Now keep this door open, you two.
[chuckles]

13:23.385 --> 13:25.930
Oh my God, I'm gonna run away!

13:27.640 --> 13:29.725
Fellas, my name is Ed.

13:29.809 --> 13:34.855
I don't like to use the word "boss,"
so call me your new "friend in charge."

13:34.939 --> 13:37.149
I know we were rivals in the past,

13:37.233 --> 13:41.946
but if we all work together,
Ala-Hican can be Ala-we-can.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.825
Have an Ala-happy day.

13:46.325 --> 13:50.079
See? Things are gonna be great.
Ed's a marshmallow sandwich.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.290
You don't want to know what that is
on a porn set.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.669
My name is Burke, and I am your boss.

13:56.752 --> 14:00.631
And the first guy who wants to know
whether Burke is my first or last name

14:00.714 --> 14:02.675
can meet me in the parking lot.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.679
You're not working for Mohican anymore.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.722
This is a real airline.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.058
That means you learn this,

14:11.141 --> 14:14.186
front to back and back to front!

14:14.270 --> 14:17.815
That ain't how I read,
and that ain't how I wipe.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.276
All right, calm down!
He's a dick, but he's no Pogo.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.486
Sorry. Go ahead, Burke.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.238
You don't get to call me that.

14:24.321 --> 14:28.534
You will refer to me
as "president of ground operations."

14:28.617 --> 14:29.577
Or POGO!

14:29.660 --> 14:31.912
Oh, this guy can suck all the dicks!

14:31.996 --> 14:34.164
Guys! Guys, come on!

14:34.248 --> 14:36.667
All right, give me a sec,
I'll... I'll bring them back.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.294
[sighs] POGO.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.212
Fuck this place.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.049
Oh, man, that made me feel good.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.261
And angry! And sleepy. And paranoid!

14:47.344 --> 14:50.306
Guys, you can't just walk out
in the middle of a...

14:51.056 --> 14:52.725
What the fuck is this place?

14:52.808 --> 14:54.685
We can't work with these assholes.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.687
Look at these fucking rules!

14:56.770 --> 15:00.107
Shirts must be tucked in?
Smile at customers?

15:00.190 --> 15:03.861
What's next? We can't fart in a jar
and put it on a plane to Honolulu?

15:03.944 --> 15:07.114
-How long has this place been here?
-We're gonna take the buyout.

15:07.197 --> 15:11.827
Then we'll become full-time pornographers
in the city of dreams,

15:11.911 --> 15:13.579
Chatsworth, California.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.248
Come on. You can't quit.
We've been through a lot together.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.458
We have a history.

15:17.541 --> 15:18.626
Fuck history.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.170
Hey, that's our next porno.

15:25.883 --> 15:29.345
It's educational,
and you can empty your balls to it.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.430
Guys, no, you can't leave!

15:31.513 --> 15:33.682
Frank, calm down.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.225
I'm glad you want to us to stay,

15:35.309 --> 15:38.687
but we weren't super dedicated
to our jobs.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.984
Matter of fact, without the union,
we'd probably be in jail.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.611
[sighs]

15:45.694 --> 15:49.114
I've had a rough few days.
Look, give me a chance to talk to Ed.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.825
He's a pushover.
I'll make everything okay.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.704
All right, but if it don't work out,
come with us to Chatsworth.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.415
You could make a killing as a stunt ass!

15:58.499 --> 16:01.710
-Dad, I want you and Frank to make up.
-Ha.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.296
And I want you to do it
at our house on Thanksgiving.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.257
I'd rather kiss Tojo on Pearl Harbor Day.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.884
Dad, this has to stop.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.721
There's so much ill will between you
and Frank, and I'm stuck in the middle.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.976
I just can't understand
what would make you attracted to someone

16:17.059 --> 16:19.144
with that level of anger.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.647
But fine.

16:21.730 --> 16:25.609
If it'll make you happy,
we'll come to Thanksgiving.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.070
-I can be reasonable.
-Great.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.156
-And I want to invite Louis.
-Never in a million lifetimes!

16:31.240 --> 16:33.659
He's gay, but he's your only son.

16:33.742 --> 16:36.203
-You two used to be so close.
-[imitates buzzer]

16:36.286 --> 16:38.706
-Dad, you were inseparable.
-[imitates buzzer]

16:38.789 --> 16:41.083
Oh, Stan, not the buzzer thing.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.420
Remember how you'd do
the Charlie Chaplin walk together?

16:44.503 --> 16:45.421
[imitates buzzer]

16:45.504 --> 16:47.423
Louis is your flesh and blood.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.759
You banished him from our family,
and you've got to fix this.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.262
Me? This is on you.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.513
It is not!

16:54.596 --> 16:59.143
Sweetie, I talk to Louis every few years.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.645
He definitely blames you.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.106
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

17:04.189 --> 17:07.443
After the Indians' cowardly sneak attack,

17:07.526 --> 17:11.905
the white settlers planned
a brave sneak attack in return.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.451
Over here, I smell them!

The redheaded kid has shit-breath.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.079
They're all redheads.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.290
That's fucking weird, man.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.666
They want to kill us.

Guys, it's time to use
the bully's secret weapon,

17:25.919 --> 17:27.254

17:27.337 --> 17:29.381
We just got to find a grown-up
to hide behind.

17:29.465 --> 17:33.010
What about that sad lady
with the man's haircut?

17:33.093 --> 17:35.387
Oh, what cologne are you wearing?

17:35.471 --> 17:37.598
I made in my pants.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.976
Oh, you wanna make in my pants?

17:41.060 --> 17:44.271
No, thank you, Cap'n. [retches]

17:44.354 --> 17:46.398
Oh, I almost had him.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.525
I'd rather get my ass kicked.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.153
Why'd you have to spear that kid
in the gooch?

17:51.236 --> 17:52.863
I didn't know he'd hold a grudge!

-Shit! We can't get to Amy.
-Yes, we can.

17:57.951 --> 18:01.789
I saw this super funny movie with my dad
for my birthday last year.

18:01.872 --> 18:06.043
It was about this badass red-haired girl
with special powers.

I was just listening to Harmo-Nation.

All right, listen, Ed. Your guy's
coming down too hard on my crew.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.583
You know, we had our own way
of doing stuff that worked good for us,

18:46.667 --> 18:49.461
and we... we want to keep doing things
the Mohican way.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.587
You understand.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.298
No, I don't.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.926
Okay, well, if.. if I say it slower?

18:56.009 --> 18:58.512
We had our way--

18:58.595 --> 19:02.641
Frank, the "Mohican way"
is why we own you now.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.268
Look at this place.

19:04.351 --> 19:09.314
Your time clock doesn't have a minute hand
and still thinks it's 1961.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.816
We're efficient.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.651
You were inefficient

19:12.734 --> 19:16.655
to the tune of two million dollars
in lost luggage make-goods last year.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.700
Now, now, now, in our defense,
half of that was Lassie.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.994
And we didn't lose her. She just froze.

19:22.077 --> 19:25.789
So, no, Frank.
You fellas have to do what we say.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.001
And I'll need you to come in
for extra unpaid training this weekend.

Ah, my stars, a carrot's just a piece
of candy grown by Mother Earth herself.

We're half of this company.

Oh, I am as serious as crotch-rot in July.
This is no bluff.

I want the same buyout Rosie got,
one week for every year.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.903
And I have been here for 20 years.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.947
That's right, you were... the first time.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.407
What?

20:00.490 --> 20:04.786
You were fired last Christmas,
and then you got rehired in April.

So, you've only really been here
for six-and-a-half months.
