WEBVTT

00:04.480 --> 00:05.794
Previously on "Claws"...

00:05.796 --> 00:08.585
You cheated on the best man you ever had.

00:08.587 --> 00:11.790
You... You... You haven't even
been there for Jennifer!

00:11.815 --> 00:14.605
I sold out the love of my life for you.

00:14.607 --> 00:17.085
I set you up. I drugged your drink

00:17.087 --> 00:19.821
so they could pull you over
and you could lose your job.

00:19.823 --> 00:21.789
You cannot be that perfect.

00:21.791 --> 00:23.861
I'm afraid I am.

00:24.961 --> 00:27.128
You are a 17-year-old white girl

00:27.130 --> 00:29.797
who's suddenly all about
the Nation of Islam.

00:29.799 --> 00:31.574
What are you doing?

00:31.576 --> 00:34.580
I'm gonna go see a lawyer.
Have papers drawn up.

00:34.582 --> 00:37.136
She ruined my businesses,
she killed my wife.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.573
I ain't taking it slowly.

00:38.575 --> 00:40.141
That Putin bitch has got to go.

00:40.143 --> 00:41.576
Everything okay, Zlata?

00:41.578 --> 00:43.845
In two weeks, we open new clinic.

00:43.847 --> 00:45.780
In five months, four more.

00:45.782 --> 00:47.415
You get our numbers up.

00:47.417 --> 00:48.983
You're under arrest.

00:48.985 --> 00:53.154
- Why am I under arrest?
- This is gonna be fun.

00:57.194 --> 00:59.192
Daddy's rolling over in his grave.

00:59.194 --> 01:01.289
Seeing me ceding
all our hard-earned goods

01:01.291 --> 01:02.385
to this commie.

01:02.387 --> 01:04.521
These damn Russians annihilated my soul,

01:04.522 --> 01:06.452
her and that dashiki Barbie.

01:06.454 --> 01:08.774
Now, come on. Don't say that
about Desna. That's offensive.

01:14.811 --> 01:16.911
How about we go
to Cracker Barrel after this?

01:16.913 --> 01:18.146
That always makes you feel better.

01:18.148 --> 01:19.647
- Yeah?
- Yeah, all right.

01:19.649 --> 01:20.946
- Yeah? All right.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.718
- Where's Zlata?
- Impressive.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.887
You work hard. I notice.

01:25.889 --> 01:27.222
Thank you, Zlata.

01:27.224 --> 01:29.757
It is nice to be appreciated.

01:29.759 --> 01:31.593
I just haven't heard from Dr. Ken.

01:31.595 --> 01:32.894
I don't know where he is.

01:32.896 --> 01:34.395
He's supposed to be here
to cut the ribbon.

01:34.397 --> 01:37.498
Stalin would have never
put up with this from a Jew.

01:39.035 --> 01:43.004
Today is a good day
to be woman in Palmetto.

01:43.006 --> 01:45.974
I stand next to another great lady

01:45.976 --> 01:48.309
who makes all this possible...

01:48.311 --> 01:52.447
my zvezda moya, my star, Desna Simms.

01:54.684 --> 01:56.751
- You earn it.
- Okay.

01:56.753 --> 01:59.387
- Please, cut, cut.
- Here we go.

02:04.561 --> 02:07.562
Oops, you earn this, too.

02:12.402 --> 02:14.168
What? You playing.

02:14.170 --> 02:16.537
Russians don't play.

02:16.539 --> 02:18.206
Shit.

02:21.711 --> 02:23.444
Ballin' now, baby.

02:29.119 --> 02:30.852
Yeah.

02:30.854 --> 02:32.053
I know that face.

02:32.055 --> 02:33.521
Don't cream the seats.

02:33.523 --> 02:35.123
It's quality leather, baby.

02:35.125 --> 02:37.225
I do look good in red.

02:37.227 --> 02:39.027
Thought your man's
supposed to buy you gifts.

02:39.029 --> 02:41.722
Can't you just be happy for me for once?

02:41.724 --> 02:43.731
I'm just saying. Things are
moving a little fast for me...

02:43.733 --> 02:45.731
Zip it!

02:45.733 --> 02:48.970
I don't say nothing about
your little mail-order bride.

02:51.488 --> 02:53.007
Roller?

02:54.116 --> 02:57.371
Was Bryce serious
about what he said at AA?

02:57.405 --> 02:59.586
That y'all are planning
something with the Haitians

02:59.588 --> 03:00.921
to come against Zlata?

03:00.922 --> 03:02.789
That's Bryce. He just talk a lot.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.423
It's the white shit in his nose.

03:04.425 --> 03:07.499
So, Uncle Daddy is not coming after her

03:07.501 --> 03:09.063
at her golf game next week?

03:09.065 --> 03:10.190
I didn't say all that.

03:10.192 --> 03:11.998
Shit.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.299
Roller, look, I owe Zlata.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.533
Look at this shit.

03:15.535 --> 03:17.468
Des, you keep your mouth shut.

03:17.470 --> 03:19.163
Let me remind you of something.

03:19.165 --> 03:21.806
When you wanted out,
Uncle Daddy let you out.

03:21.808 --> 03:23.140
But...

03:23.604 --> 03:26.143
But... Zlata's Zlata, okay?

03:27.296 --> 03:28.984
Uncle Daddy's family.

03:29.649 --> 03:30.948
Your family.

03:35.254 --> 03:37.088
I swear, I didn't do anything wrong.

03:37.090 --> 03:39.557
We must have a different definition
of "right" and "wrong", then.

03:39.559 --> 03:41.626
Last I checked, I could swear

03:41.628 --> 03:43.761
overprescribing
and conspiracy to traffic drugs

03:43.763 --> 03:46.197
are high-class felonies.

03:46.199 --> 03:48.516
Yeah. You're going away
for a long, long time.

03:48.518 --> 03:49.767
No, no, no, no.

03:49.769 --> 03:51.636
I have... I have proof, evidence.

03:51.638 --> 03:53.304
E-Everything is above board.

03:53.306 --> 03:55.139
"Above board"?

03:55.141 --> 03:56.507
Is that what you call prescribing oxy

03:56.509 --> 03:58.643
for post-partum pain in an octogenarian?

03:58.645 --> 04:01.212
Hey. Weren't you fired?

04:01.214 --> 04:03.080
- Do I look like I'm fired?
- She's standing right here.

04:03.082 --> 04:04.060
Did...

04:04.062 --> 04:06.350
Sarasota PD's been working with the FBI,

04:06.352 --> 04:08.386
so the question you should be
asking yourself is,

04:08.388 --> 04:11.322
"What don't we know?" You want
to take the stink off yourself?

04:11.324 --> 04:13.324
- Tell us who you're working for.
- I can't.

04:13.326 --> 04:14.659
You don't know what you're asking.

04:14.661 --> 04:16.459
I know what we're prepared to offer.

04:16.462 --> 04:18.495
Of course, if you'd prefer
the RICO charges,

04:18.498 --> 04:20.398
that's 30 years
of your ass getting more dick

04:20.399 --> 04:21.832
than a bus-station urinal.

04:21.834 --> 04:24.502
Good news is, now they have K-Y
at the prison com.

04:24.504 --> 04:26.304
Last chance to tell us
who you're working for.

04:28.908 --> 04:31.676
Suit yourself.

04:35.815 --> 04:39.116
Hey, why... why does she
get to go and not me?

04:39.118 --> 04:41.318
Old lady played you like a fiddle.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.553
She's with us.

04:42.555 --> 04:44.555
K-Y comes in flavors now.

04:44.557 --> 04:47.372
Okay, okay! It was the Russians!

04:47.374 --> 04:52.296
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

04:52.649 --> 04:53.680
So, what do you think about us

04:53.682 --> 04:55.878
spending some time together on Saturday?

04:55.879 --> 04:57.979
I hear Lilly Pulitzer
is having a sample sale.

04:57.981 --> 05:00.554
Um, I would, but...

05:00.556 --> 05:03.010
Malik and I are going to
the Pan-African Book Fair, so...

05:03.035 --> 05:05.469
Well, that sounds like
more fun. Can I come?

05:05.471 --> 05:07.004
It's not really your scene, Polly.

05:07.006 --> 05:09.206
Um, I'm going to get
a shrimp breakfast burrito

05:09.208 --> 05:10.407
before school, so...

05:10.409 --> 05:11.642
Didn't you check your bag?

05:11.644 --> 05:13.911
I packed a breakfast like a good mama.

05:14.947 --> 05:15.876
Yep.

05:15.878 --> 05:18.554
Um, thanks, but these
kind of taste like cardboard.

05:18.556 --> 05:20.584
These are perfect to start your day

05:20.586 --> 05:22.419
full of protein and amphetamines.

05:22.421 --> 05:24.321
Thanks, anyway.

05:24.323 --> 05:26.257
Hey, wait. No hug?

05:31.631 --> 05:34.331
Ooh, I know that face, Ann.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.634
You patched things up with Arlene?

05:38.871 --> 05:40.638
I'm so glad!

05:42.275 --> 05:43.874
What's going on in here?

05:43.876 --> 05:45.442
What's going on with you?

05:45.444 --> 05:47.114
You think I didn't clock that new whip

05:47.139 --> 05:49.066
- you just pulled up in?
- Ha!

05:49.068 --> 05:52.616
A what? Hold on. A Maserati?

05:52.618 --> 05:54.652
Who did you have to blow to get that?

05:54.654 --> 05:57.488
For your information,
Zlata gave it to me.

05:59.625 --> 06:01.058
You eat from the tuna can?

06:01.060 --> 06:03.460
Shut up, 12-inch fashion doll.

06:03.462 --> 06:05.289
But are you eating from the tuna can?

06:05.291 --> 06:07.598
Mother is strictly dickly, okay?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.133
Mnh-mnh.

06:09.135 --> 06:12.459
This is how bosses are
supposed to treat you, okay?

06:12.460 --> 06:16.329
Zlata recognized my hard work,
and she rewarded a girl.

06:16.331 --> 06:18.364
Well, what we need to do to get a car?

06:18.366 --> 06:19.899
'Cause, we work hard, too.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.535
- Amen to that.
- Well, I'm her lieutenant.

06:22.537 --> 06:24.637
- Yeah, we know.
- And it's a management thing.

06:24.639 --> 06:27.940
Excuse me, but as the master
choreographer of Polly's Boys,

06:27.942 --> 06:30.743
one might argue that I'm management, too.

06:30.745 --> 06:32.378
Okay.

06:32.380 --> 06:33.813
Take it up with her at a morning meeting.

06:33.815 --> 06:35.514
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

06:35.516 --> 06:37.015
You're getting everything you want today.

06:37.017 --> 06:38.924
You see what your boyfriend sent?

06:41.551 --> 06:44.724
It's chilly up in here.

06:48.934 --> 06:52.898
So, you're going to tell
Psycho Zlata about Uncle Daddy?

06:52.900 --> 06:54.975
Girl, you need to think twice
about helping her.

06:54.977 --> 06:57.103
Listen, okay, seriously, you guys,

06:57.105 --> 06:58.371
she is not that bad.

07:00.108 --> 07:01.440
She's smart, she gets it,

07:01.442 --> 07:03.909
and she just wants to see women rise up.

07:03.911 --> 07:04.954
Riva.

07:07.619 --> 07:09.348
Okay. All right.

07:09.350 --> 07:10.983
I will at least

07:10.985 --> 07:14.654
try to talk Uncle Daddy
out of this stupid plan.

07:14.656 --> 07:17.123
It's got to be worth a shot.

07:19.927 --> 07:23.295
All you got to do is catch
some big fish for us on tape,

07:23.297 --> 07:26.032
and we send you to Witness Protection.

07:26.034 --> 07:27.366
A wire?

07:27.368 --> 07:29.735
You want me to talk to them
while I wear a wire?

07:29.737 --> 07:31.604
I... I can barely talk to them now.

07:31.606 --> 07:34.206
Well, you better learn fast,
or you're going to jail.

07:35.610 --> 07:38.678
So, I-i-i-i-is this, like, deep cover?

07:38.680 --> 07:40.880
Like, like, can I be a secret agent?

07:40.882 --> 07:42.181
Sure, Ken.

07:42.183 --> 07:44.016
Whatever helps you get through the day.

07:44.018 --> 07:45.571
Okay. Okay.

07:45.573 --> 07:48.120
I-I'm going to need Tums...
a lot of Tums...

07:48.122 --> 07:50.222
and I want a badass nickname.

07:50.224 --> 07:52.992
Donnie Brasco, this shit just got real.

07:59.534 --> 08:02.668
There's no version
that ends with you breathin'.

08:02.670 --> 08:04.570
I got a version for ya.

08:04.572 --> 08:06.839
I shoot her in the head,
she's dead. How's that?

08:06.841 --> 08:10.576
Next week, this time,
you'll be back working for me

08:10.578 --> 08:11.777
and living the high life.

08:11.779 --> 08:13.579
You really have lost your damn mind.

08:13.581 --> 08:15.581
You think I'm going to go back
to doing all the work

08:15.583 --> 08:18.117
and not getting my bonuses? Shit.

08:18.119 --> 08:20.753
Come on now, Miss Desna, I thought
we moved off of that, baby.

08:20.755 --> 08:22.488
Tell me how you see it playing out, Clay.

08:23.491 --> 08:25.725
You roll up on her golf game,

08:25.727 --> 08:27.426
take her out on her turf?

08:27.428 --> 08:28.928
And then what?

08:28.930 --> 08:30.696
"Hey, boys, let's play a round or two."

08:30.698 --> 08:34.232
You got to be smarter than that, Clay.

08:34.235 --> 08:36.034
How's that Soviet titty milk taste?

08:36.037 --> 08:37.470
Is it creamy?

08:38.126 --> 08:40.905
Clay, these folk got some
serious hardware over there.

08:40.908 --> 08:43.708
- It's not just the drugs.
- I don't give a piss.

08:43.711 --> 08:46.312
They killed my Juanda,
they took everything I own.

08:46.314 --> 08:48.547
That bitch deserves to die,

08:48.549 --> 08:50.067
and it's sure as shit
gonna to be me the one

08:50.069 --> 08:51.534
that's gonna snuff her out.

08:51.536 --> 08:54.120
If I can be honest,
I don't give a shit about you.

08:54.122 --> 08:55.688
I don't care if you live or die.

08:55.690 --> 08:58.290
It's the collateral damage
that I'm worried about.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.460
Well, I got some news for you.

09:01.858 --> 09:04.130
The South done lost once.

09:04.527 --> 09:06.732
It ain't finna to do it again.

09:10.872 --> 09:12.974
Shit.

09:17.989 --> 09:19.489
He didn't listen.

09:19.491 --> 09:22.392
Uncle Daddy is going to get
his crazy ass killed.

09:22.394 --> 09:24.928
Just to be clear, you sure you care?

09:24.930 --> 09:26.196
I'm just saying.

09:26.198 --> 09:27.797
Uncle Daddy ain't give you no car.

09:30.235 --> 09:33.269
You like the little
zippity-dippity car toy?

09:33.271 --> 09:35.538
- I love it.
- That's great.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.006
And big news tonight,

09:37.008 --> 09:39.008
it's going to rain at Hammer and Pickle.

09:39.010 --> 09:41.378
Yes. I got my 1s ready.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.880
Because who's ready
for feature dancer Dean?

09:43.882 --> 09:45.815
Wait, what?

09:45.817 --> 09:47.484
No, no, no. No, no.

09:47.486 --> 09:50.186
Okay, you need to give him a minute.

09:50.188 --> 09:51.488
He's not ready for that.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.199
Desna, I've been drilling
his stripper pas de bourrée,

09:54.201 --> 09:55.800
and the P-boy's got some moves.

09:55.802 --> 09:57.068
Polly, you are not helping.

09:57.070 --> 09:59.204
I'm just saying, he is damn good.

09:59.206 --> 10:01.072
- Be a shame to hide it.
- Yes.

10:01.074 --> 10:02.440
You jailbird,

10:02.442 --> 10:04.595
you take your men
and you bust your moves now.

10:04.597 --> 10:06.211
- Okay, wait.
- No, no, no. Listen.

10:06.213 --> 10:09.781
Dean doesn't do well
with big crowds and loud music.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.649
Shh, this is why we do it...

10:11.651 --> 10:13.885
to give him power over his fears.

10:13.887 --> 10:15.620
Okay, why do you even care?

10:15.622 --> 10:18.456
Desna, you're smart,
hard-working, and loyal.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.125
Loyalty's hard to find.

10:20.127 --> 10:21.793
Loyal person is family.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.762
I do anything for family.

10:23.764 --> 10:25.897
You. Are. Family.

10:25.899 --> 10:27.599
Wasn't Riva family?

10:29.002 --> 10:31.870
Jennifer, Riva was blood.

10:31.872 --> 10:34.205
Blood makes you related.

10:34.207 --> 10:38.243
Loyalty makes you family.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.780
What, what, what, what is on your mind?

10:47.954 --> 10:50.655
Zlata, I heard a rumor, okay?

10:50.657 --> 10:51.923
And... It is true

10:51.925 --> 10:54.559
I hand-feed raw hamburger to president

10:54.561 --> 10:56.628
at sex party at Mar-a-Iago.

10:56.630 --> 10:58.096
Not that, okay?

10:58.098 --> 10:59.697
The Dixie Mafia...

10:59.699 --> 11:03.535
they're planning to attack you
at your golf game next week.

11:06.439 --> 11:08.606
See, this is why you are number two.

11:08.608 --> 11:10.542
You take care of me, I take care of you.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.777
I will handle it. I was thinking...

11:12.779 --> 11:16.080
maybe I could put together a sit-down,

11:16.082 --> 11:18.049
just so nobody gets hurt?

11:20.931 --> 11:21.953
Okay. Great.

11:21.955 --> 11:24.522
So, you just gonna talk, right?

11:24.524 --> 11:25.924
Yes. Talk.

11:25.926 --> 11:27.759
Just talking.

11:27.761 --> 11:28.960
Okay.

11:28.962 --> 11:30.298
Yes.

11:34.434 --> 11:38.102
Yes, and lunge!
Yes, that's good! Body roll!

11:39.906 --> 11:42.340
And pulver it!

11:43.810 --> 11:47.011
Cross, turn, and across!

11:47.013 --> 11:48.179
Turn!

11:50.951 --> 11:53.384
No, no, no, no! No, no!

11:53.386 --> 11:55.320
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

11:55.322 --> 11:56.788
Get up! Line up!

11:56.790 --> 11:59.057
This isn't singles tennis, boys.

11:59.059 --> 12:00.959
I need you to play together!

12:00.961 --> 12:03.228
I know you've got big dreams.

12:03.230 --> 12:04.696
I know you want fame,

12:04.698 --> 12:08.967
but as a wise teacher
told me once, fame costs.

12:08.969 --> 12:13.071
And right here is where
you start paying in sweat.

12:13.073 --> 12:19.077
And the better you are, the more
sweat I'm going to demand.

12:19.079 --> 12:22.180
Now, Master Polly wants to know,

12:22.182 --> 12:25.817
are you ready to sweat?

12:27.921 --> 12:30.321
Right, 2, 1!

12:30.323 --> 12:32.957
And 5, 6, 7, 8!

12:40.333 --> 12:42.122
Took you long enough.

12:43.491 --> 12:45.303
I don't operate at your beck and call.

12:45.305 --> 12:46.838
Listen, me and my boys...

12:46.840 --> 12:49.007
we want to move on this Russian skank.

12:49.009 --> 12:50.775
What boys are these?

12:50.777 --> 12:53.878
So you rounded up
some swamp critters to help you.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.481
We move on the Russians
when the time is right,

12:56.483 --> 12:57.916
not when you say.

13:00.054 --> 13:01.686
You don't look well, my friend.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.123
You smell like road kill

13:05.125 --> 13:10.428
and you look like a big, fat,
greasy balloon ready to pop.

13:10.430 --> 13:12.063
A pink balloon.

13:12.065 --> 13:14.399
You really should be on a statin.

13:14.401 --> 13:16.537
Yeah? Yeah.

13:16.539 --> 13:19.304
That's your professional
vaginologist opinion?

13:20.674 --> 13:23.041
You said we could move
when the clinic is open.

13:23.043 --> 13:24.120
No.

13:24.511 --> 13:27.145
I said we move when all the clinics open.

13:27.147 --> 13:28.947
Well, what if I don't like that deal?

13:30.000 --> 13:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:40.827 --> 13:43.328
Maybe we dissolve our deal.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.733
Let's not discuss this again.

14:02.148 --> 14:05.483
I am not ready to see my brother
up on no pole tonight.

14:05.485 --> 14:07.418
Come on, Des. You know
he's going to be great.

14:07.420 --> 14:09.988
Wait, wait.

14:09.990 --> 14:11.356
Go back. Go back.

14:11.358 --> 14:14.625
Is that... that is not
a pacifier with a grill.

14:14.627 --> 14:16.361
You already know.

14:16.363 --> 14:18.162
You long for that?

14:18.164 --> 14:19.497
Just like his daddy.

14:19.499 --> 14:21.799
Got to teach him
while he's young, you know?

14:21.801 --> 14:23.434
He is a cutie pie, though.

14:23.436 --> 14:25.970
Teach him how to put on
a love glove, though,

14:25.972 --> 14:27.238
unlike his daddy.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.520
A little bit louder
for the people in the back.

14:33.246 --> 14:35.719
- Shit.
- What's up?

14:35.721 --> 14:36.948
Got to get over to the new clinic.

14:36.950 --> 14:39.350
You mind if, Jenn finishes up?

14:39.352 --> 14:41.248
- Can you?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:41.250 --> 14:42.320
Virginia, can you take over?

14:42.322 --> 14:43.955
All right.

14:45.992 --> 14:48.793
Hey! Damn, Jenn, come on.

14:48.795 --> 14:50.995
Right in the middle of your face.

14:50.997 --> 14:52.730
Be still.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.333
Have you talked to Bryce?

14:55.335 --> 14:57.568
You sound like a broken record.

14:57.570 --> 14:59.504
Well, you heard what he said...
he wants a divorce,

14:59.506 --> 15:00.805
and I don't want that.

15:00.807 --> 15:03.107
So I'm going to need your help.

15:03.678 --> 15:05.076
Well, you both done changed.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.611
You need to accept that.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.934
What you want is then,
it ain't now, Jenn, you feel me?

15:17.123 --> 15:19.924
See this here, Toby?

15:19.926 --> 15:24.228
This here the face of a man
who lost his mojo.

15:24.230 --> 15:26.731
No, you're a man, Daddy.

15:26.733 --> 15:28.833
I mean, I used to have it all...

15:28.835 --> 15:34.072
power, money, a wife,
and a live-in boy toy.

15:34.074 --> 15:35.473
Now look at me.

15:35.475 --> 15:38.276
Might as well be a fart in a fan factory.

15:38.278 --> 15:39.844
No, no, no, Clay.

15:39.846 --> 15:40.980
No.

15:44.313 --> 15:46.150
So, what did the Hey-tian say?

15:47.687 --> 15:50.421
I'm so sick and tired
of people pissing in my mouth

15:50.423 --> 15:52.757
and telling me it's mango La Croix.

15:52.759 --> 15:55.393
You're right. Hold that thought.

15:55.395 --> 15:57.261
I got to go to the tinkle-torium.

15:57.263 --> 15:59.130
Well, this is no freeway.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.798
Got to pay the toll.

16:04.437 --> 16:07.138
Do you see this? Disgusting.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.740
Are you serious?

16:11.211 --> 16:12.510
What is going on?

16:12.512 --> 16:14.045
Your new doctor's having a panic attack.

16:14.047 --> 16:16.414
Y'all sure know how to pick 'em.

16:16.416 --> 16:18.249
Stephanie?

16:18.251 --> 16:20.118
Open the door.

16:20.887 --> 16:24.088
You don't want to do something
you're going to regret!

16:24.090 --> 16:25.690
Open the damn door!

16:28.110 --> 16:29.634
What is wrong with you?

16:29.636 --> 16:31.078
My girl just get arrested.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.430
My best friend from med school...

16:32.432 --> 16:34.242
she worked a clinic over in Clearwater.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.434
One of the patients OD'd,
so they looked into the clinic,

16:36.436 --> 16:38.336
all the overperscribing,
it's all over the paper.

16:38.338 --> 16:39.638
She's going to jail.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.572
- They're starting to crack down...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:41.574 --> 16:44.675
Can I invite you
to think differently?

16:44.677 --> 16:46.077
The way I see it,

16:46.079 --> 16:49.313
this is a chance
for us to tighten our game.

16:49.315 --> 16:51.782
I can't go out like this. I have kids.

16:51.784 --> 16:53.284
I'm a pillar of my community and...

16:53.286 --> 16:54.919
You came from a hospital

16:54.921 --> 16:57.722
that was being pimped out by Big Pharma,

16:57.724 --> 16:59.090
turning away patients

16:59.092 --> 17:01.526
because they didn't
have insurance, right?

17:01.528 --> 17:03.013
- That what you told me?
- Yes.

17:03.015 --> 17:05.530
Okay. How's this worse?

17:05.531 --> 17:06.998
You scale back the scripts,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.233
turn pill-billies away
for a couple of weeks,

17:09.234 --> 17:11.801
make a big deal out of it, you know?

17:11.804 --> 17:14.070
Refer them to a good treatment facility.

17:14.073 --> 17:17.074
I'll explain the dip in profits
to the Russians.

17:17.909 --> 17:18.943
I don't know.

17:20.146 --> 17:23.647
Look, if you go down,
girlfriend, I go down,

17:23.650 --> 17:25.849
and I'm not going to let that happen.

17:25.852 --> 17:28.286
I got your back, okay?

17:28.865 --> 17:33.157
This is when we drink
a tall glass of Act Right

17:33.159 --> 17:34.792
and ride out the storm.

17:35.828 --> 17:38.291
Get it together, Stephanie!

17:43.336 --> 17:46.204
Polly, this is my mother, Marilyn.

17:47.974 --> 17:51.108
Well, enchanted to meet you, finally.

17:51.110 --> 17:52.310
Nice to meet you.

17:52.312 --> 17:53.844
Well, isn't this a...

17:53.846 --> 17:57.949
a totally unexpected and
completely unscheduled surprise.

17:57.951 --> 18:01.752
I figured it was time
we all sat to a Shabbat dinner

18:01.754 --> 18:05.456
so I can get to know you
and my new granddaughter.

18:05.458 --> 18:07.158
Ooh, I love that,

18:07.160 --> 18:09.427
but unfortunately, she's not here.

18:09.429 --> 18:11.762
I... called her.

18:12.799 --> 18:13.998
Hi.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.600
Great.

18:15.602 --> 18:17.735
Hey. This is my mom.

18:17.737 --> 18:19.870
You must be Marnie.

18:19.872 --> 18:22.073
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, sweetie.

18:22.075 --> 18:24.542
And who is this
extremely handsome young man?

18:24.544 --> 18:26.244
This is my boyfriend, Malik.

18:26.246 --> 18:27.511
Since when?

18:27.513 --> 18:28.779
You didn't tell me you were official.

18:28.781 --> 18:30.681
I don't tell you everything.

18:31.718 --> 18:34.185
Unfortunately, I do have to...

18:34.187 --> 18:35.553
get to work, so...

18:35.555 --> 18:37.555
is there another time
that we can do this?

18:37.557 --> 18:39.023
We can just have dinner without you.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.259
Can Marnie and I help in the kitchen?

18:41.261 --> 18:42.893
Of course you can.

18:42.895 --> 18:46.897
Aww, and miss family time
with my wonderful daughter

18:46.899 --> 18:48.566
and Ken's beautiful mother?

18:48.568 --> 18:50.601
Never. I would never do that.

18:51.871 --> 18:55.072
Just how fast do Jews eat?

18:56.476 --> 18:57.908
Tell you the truth,

18:57.910 --> 18:59.910
you looked better
in that outfit than he did.

18:59.912 --> 19:03.347
Don't you look so pretty.

19:03.349 --> 19:04.782
The Clay I knew

19:04.784 --> 19:08.052
would have shown those boys
the pain already.

19:14.661 --> 19:16.694
The Clay I loved

19:16.696 --> 19:19.597
would have cleared
that debris right up...

19:19.599 --> 19:21.399
with a quickness, too.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.068
Would have told him
there's clits bigger than

19:24.070 --> 19:26.904
their inverted baby-pecker niblets.

19:27.858 --> 19:31.409
I haven't been myself lately.

19:31.411 --> 19:34.612
It's been real bad
since you've been gone.

19:34.614 --> 19:36.325
I know, baby.

19:39.986 --> 19:42.953
Look. They got them a woman.

19:42.955 --> 19:46.090
Is that a skort she got on?

19:46.092 --> 19:50.428
A skort is the hysterectomy
of casual separates, baby.

19:50.430 --> 19:51.796
We both know that.

19:51.798 --> 19:54.565
Now you go on and tell her.

19:54.567 --> 19:56.033
You tell all of them

19:56.035 --> 19:59.270
they are in the presence of a great man.

19:59.272 --> 20:00.705
Maybe bend a couple few

20:00.707 --> 20:02.506
over the ice machine in the back.

20:02.508 --> 20:06.711
You know what they say about
those who protest too much.

20:06.713 --> 20:09.480
Teach them the error of their ways.

20:12.885 --> 20:15.886
The voodoo doc is right about your heart.

20:16.699 --> 20:20.758
I see everything up here.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.998
Need another?

20:32.672 --> 20:34.038
Yeah, yeah.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.135
Yeah, keep 'em coming.

20:36.943 --> 20:38.542
Aw, come on, man.

20:38.544 --> 20:41.245
Why do you got to keep serving
these homo-whatever-he-is?

20:41.247 --> 20:44.268
Hey, stop throwing
your lifestyle in our face.

20:44.817 --> 20:48.552
You picked the wrong bar,
you bald-headed faggot.

21:04.108 --> 21:05.139
Y'all thirsty!?

21:19.719 --> 21:23.154
Save that for something special.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.855
Baby.

21:24.857 --> 21:26.791
Baby, I miss you.

21:26.793 --> 21:29.527
I miss you so much.

21:43.209 --> 21:45.342
Whoo-hoo! We're back, bitches!

21:45.344 --> 21:46.911
Hells, yeah, we are, boy.

21:46.913 --> 21:48.245
Screw them Haitians.

21:48.247 --> 21:49.914
I'm gonna take care of business myself.

21:57.542 --> 22:00.678
And... and... and Zlata said
that if tonight works out,

22:00.680 --> 22:03.280
we can do "Raining Men" once a month.

22:03.282 --> 22:05.082
She's so sweet. Don't you like her, Des?

22:05.084 --> 22:06.584
I do, baby, but aren't you
going to be nervous up there

22:06.586 --> 22:08.486
in front of all those people?

22:08.488 --> 22:09.888
Virginia said pretend that

22:09.913 --> 22:11.288
everyone is in their underwear.

22:11.290 --> 22:12.757
So that's what she used to do.

22:12.759 --> 22:14.258
Is that what she said?

22:15.828 --> 22:17.495
I want you to know
I'm proud of you, Dean.

22:17.497 --> 22:20.464
And look at us, we got the big house.

22:20.466 --> 22:22.099
No more black mold.

22:22.101 --> 22:24.735
But not the dual masters,
don't forget the dual masters.

22:24.737 --> 22:26.670
- Dual masters have their own bathroom.
- I know.

22:26.672 --> 22:28.806
- I promised.
- You did!

22:28.808 --> 22:32.643
Well, but, Dean,
we are moving up, though.

22:32.645 --> 22:35.112
I mean, we haven't quite
got there, but we will.

22:35.114 --> 22:36.313
- Yeah.
- Okay?

22:36.315 --> 22:37.515
We will.

22:37.517 --> 22:40.317
I promise.

22:40.319 --> 22:41.685
Yeah, I forgot.

22:41.687 --> 22:44.522
Me and Virginia invited Dr. Ruval.

22:44.524 --> 22:48.059
- To the strip club in Palmghetto?
- Yeah.

22:48.061 --> 22:49.393
Okay, Dean.

22:49.395 --> 22:52.763
We had plans tonight,
so if he can't stay long,

22:52.765 --> 22:55.140
it's because he has
a C-section later, okay?

22:55.142 --> 22:56.767
Yeah, okay.

22:56.769 --> 22:58.335
Des.

22:58.337 --> 23:00.471
- I-I need a favor.
- Anything.

23:00.473 --> 23:01.939
Could you get my perineum?

23:01.941 --> 23:03.741
I-I can't reach it.

23:04.782 --> 23:06.777
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

23:06.779 --> 23:09.452
- Knock yourself out.
- O-Okay.

23:09.454 --> 23:11.832
Okay.

23:14.587 --> 23:16.353
Well the hell's that brother of yours?

23:16.355 --> 23:18.622
He's probably screwing
that Siberian husky.

23:18.624 --> 23:20.991
Well, I ain't gonna wait
on his damn ejaculation.

23:20.993 --> 23:23.060
That boy needs to be with his family.

23:23.062 --> 23:25.696
Get him on the phone.
Shit's about to go down.

23:25.698 --> 23:27.298
Wait, we're going early?

23:27.300 --> 23:29.700
We... We attacking Zlata tonight?

23:29.702 --> 23:31.772
I called in some friendlies
from Carolinas.

23:31.774 --> 23:33.537
They're on their way.

23:34.152 --> 23:35.840
You want to do this at the strip club?

23:35.842 --> 23:37.541
Well, there ain't no sense in waiting.

23:37.543 --> 23:39.692
We can't let our foredaddies down.

23:41.581 --> 23:44.048
Can't let the fo-foredaddies down.

23:49.188 --> 23:51.712
Shh. Shh.

23:52.592 --> 23:55.292
Come on.

23:55.294 --> 23:57.736
This is shit.

23:58.598 --> 24:01.021
Okay, baby is sick, not his fault.

24:01.022 --> 24:02.421
Why is he still yacking?

24:02.423 --> 24:05.057
Just give to me, go wash up. It's okay.

24:05.059 --> 24:07.226
Whoa. He's really hot, Roller.

24:07.228 --> 24:08.561
You know what?

24:08.563 --> 24:10.629
I'm going to call his doctor right now.

24:18.773 --> 24:20.901
Amen. Amen.

24:22.276 --> 24:24.376
Would anyone else like to add a blessing?

24:24.378 --> 24:26.378
I would. Malik taught me something.

24:26.380 --> 24:28.047
Why don't I do it?

24:28.049 --> 24:29.849
My daddy was a preacher, after all.

24:29.851 --> 24:31.217
Since when?

24:31.219 --> 24:33.185
Since the Southern Baptist
First Denominational.

24:33.187 --> 24:35.721
Holy Mother Church of All Saints said so.

24:37.167 --> 24:39.058
Let the child say her prayer.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.593
Thank you for hearing me.

24:40.595 --> 24:42.127
I hear you, go ahead.

24:42.129 --> 24:44.964
- Say your little... prayer.
- Jesus.

24:55.943 --> 24:58.110
Fight the power!

25:01.482 --> 25:04.416
Gosh, I'm so sorry.
Gosh, I'm sorry.

25:04.418 --> 25:06.051
Ooh, gosh.

25:06.053 --> 25:07.253
I'm so sorry.

25:11.392 --> 25:13.205
Hey, don't y'all think.

25:13.207 --> 25:16.128
Marnie would look so pretty
with red hair?

25:16.130 --> 25:17.429
I like my natural hair color.

25:17.431 --> 25:18.697
Come on, girl.

25:18.699 --> 25:20.666
Once you go red, everything changes.

25:20.668 --> 25:24.637
I'm talking mo' money,
mo' honey, all the mo's.

25:24.639 --> 25:26.305
I don't want to look like you.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.208
Who wants dessert?

25:29.762 --> 25:31.310
We're still eating dinner.

25:31.312 --> 25:33.178
Okay.

25:35.351 --> 25:36.815
Let's do makeovers later.

25:36.817 --> 25:39.385
Wait, how about we just do
a little strip of red?

25:39.387 --> 25:40.586
Just to see if you like it.

25:40.588 --> 25:41.987
Like a sister?

25:41.989 --> 25:43.389
Do you have a sister?

25:44.234 --> 25:46.292
She does. A twin sister.

25:46.294 --> 25:48.661
She's a marketing exec...

25:48.663 --> 25:51.530
at a Starbucks in Seattle.

25:51.532 --> 25:54.199
She's... We're...
She's a stick in the mud.

25:54.201 --> 25:56.468
We've never been that cl-close.

25:56.470 --> 25:58.470
I always thought twins were inseparable.

25:58.472 --> 26:00.639
Well, we're not. I got to go.

26:00.641 --> 26:02.374
Polly.

26:04.011 --> 26:06.045
Hold on just a second.

26:06.723 --> 26:08.380
What?

26:08.382 --> 26:10.382
Can I ask you why it's so important

26:10.384 --> 26:11.884
for Marnie to look like you?

26:11.886 --> 26:13.218
It's not.

26:13.220 --> 26:14.940
I just thought we could have
some girl time.

26:15.957 --> 26:18.390
The therapist in me is telling me that

26:18.392 --> 26:21.126
that's not what it's really about.

26:21.128 --> 26:22.394
What do you mean?

26:22.396 --> 26:24.763
It's easy to lie to ourselves, isn't it?

26:24.765 --> 26:27.933
It means we don't have to face
what's really there.

26:28.769 --> 26:30.369
I'm sorry, Mother Brickman,

26:30.371 --> 26:32.091
I still don't know
what you're referring to.

26:33.407 --> 26:35.574
If you want any chance

26:35.576 --> 26:37.543
of connecting with that child,

26:37.545 --> 26:39.707
you need to figure it out.

26:40.414 --> 26:42.915
There's something going on inside you.

26:42.917 --> 26:44.583
I can see it.

26:49.123 --> 26:51.290
Hello, babies.

26:51.292 --> 26:52.791
Look, it's Daddy!

26:52.793 --> 26:54.026
- Daddy!
- Yeah.

26:54.028 --> 26:55.561
Hey, girls, hey.

26:55.563 --> 26:57.162
Come on, let's get going.

26:57.164 --> 26:58.697
Sammy's babysitting tonight.

26:58.699 --> 27:01.117
Hey, you help your sister
buckle up, all right?

27:01.119 --> 27:02.735
Hey, Uncle Daddy.

27:04.672 --> 27:08.540
Had a lawyer draw them up,
friend of Uncle Daddy's.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.043
You know, you don't have to do this.

27:11.045 --> 27:13.879
We can go back to the way it
was. We could just start over.

27:13.881 --> 27:15.681
It's never going to be how it was.

27:15.683 --> 27:18.083
I know this is hard, Jenn.
It's not easy for me, either.

27:18.085 --> 27:19.518
So don't do it, then.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.787
We can't come back
from the things we've done.

27:21.789 --> 27:24.356
How do you know?

27:24.358 --> 27:26.225
You haven't even tried.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.760
And I still love you.

27:27.762 --> 27:30.329
No, no, you don't.
No, that's the problem.

27:30.331 --> 27:31.897
You love who I used to be,

27:31.899 --> 27:34.466
- who we used to be.
- Okay. All right.

27:35.262 --> 27:36.612
We're just not those people anymore.

27:36.614 --> 27:38.137
All right.

27:40.372 --> 27:41.440
All right.

27:59.493 --> 28:03.128
Okay, we got to go!

28:04.799 --> 28:06.765
Have you lost your handsome mind?

28:06.767 --> 28:08.867
What are we doing here?

28:10.547 --> 28:12.304
Take off your shoes.

28:12.674 --> 28:13.772
W...

28:14.551 --> 28:16.742
We're going to be late for Dean's show.

28:16.744 --> 28:19.378
Come on, there's an opening act.

28:19.380 --> 28:20.712
Don't worry, we'll make it.

28:20.714 --> 28:22.714
Well, what are... what are we doing?

28:22.716 --> 28:23.936
Trust me.

28:25.019 --> 28:26.452
Shit.

28:27.189 --> 28:28.821
I'll do whatever it takes

28:29.316 --> 28:31.256
to make your dreams come true.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.699
Marry me, Desna,

28:40.701 --> 28:42.468
and make my dreams come true.

28:44.071 --> 28:45.944
Put it on me, put it on me!

28:48.499 --> 28:51.076
Yes, yes!

28:55.583 --> 28:58.717
- Yes, a thousand times, yes.
- I love you.

29:12.767 --> 29:14.633
Des?!

29:14.635 --> 29:16.669
My gosh! My gosh.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.371
- You really did?
- Yes!

29:18.373 --> 29:20.706
- Really did.
- I'll get us some drinks, okay?

29:23.501 --> 29:25.077
Congratulations.

29:25.747 --> 29:27.179
Thank you.

29:27.181 --> 29:29.415
My God. Is that real?

29:29.417 --> 29:31.884
Hell, yeah, it's real!

29:31.886 --> 29:33.853
- My God.
- What? What?

29:33.855 --> 29:36.022
Did he put a ring on it?!

29:38.726 --> 29:41.060
I'm really happy for you, Des.

29:41.062 --> 29:43.229
Me, too, girl. You deserve a good man.

29:43.231 --> 29:47.066
You deserve all the good stuff, truly.

29:47.068 --> 29:48.501
I love you.

29:48.503 --> 29:52.104
Okay, I got to call places for my boys.

29:52.106 --> 29:54.373
- Get 'em, Pol!
- Get it, Pol!

29:54.375 --> 29:55.574
Let me look.

29:55.944 --> 29:58.077
Ooh, girl, leave it to you

29:58.079 --> 30:00.413
to get everything and three karats.

30:04.617 --> 30:06.218
But listen,
ruffles are gonna add 10 pounds

30:06.220 --> 30:07.853
to this maid of honor.

30:07.855 --> 30:09.989
The Doritos don't help.

30:09.991 --> 30:12.158
I got you, girl.

30:12.160 --> 30:13.759
It's good to see you two together.

30:13.761 --> 30:16.887
- You look happy.
- Yes, insanely happy.

30:16.889 --> 30:19.698
We're finally right back
where we need to be.

30:19.700 --> 30:22.735
Without further ado,
we're letting it rain the men

30:22.737 --> 30:25.638
on your parade at Hammer and Pickle!

30:31.012 --> 30:33.079
Ooh, here we go!

30:35.383 --> 30:37.149
There he is.

30:37.151 --> 30:39.085
Whoo!

30:43.057 --> 30:44.874
Take it off!

30:44.876 --> 30:46.092
What?

30:49.030 --> 30:50.963
- Damn it.
- Shit.

30:50.965 --> 30:53.799
I knew the large crowd
was going to get to him.

30:53.801 --> 30:55.267
I thought that quickie in the back

30:55.269 --> 30:56.802
would have calmed him down.

30:56.804 --> 30:58.270
Maybe it was too quick.

30:58.272 --> 31:00.473
Hold this. I'm going back there.

31:00.475 --> 31:01.740
Unh-unh.

31:01.742 --> 31:02.975
You got to let him do this...

31:02.977 --> 31:04.805
on his own.

31:07.148 --> 31:10.483
Shh, shh.

31:10.485 --> 31:11.917
The baby got dry lips?

31:13.221 --> 31:14.787
We tried to give him liquids.

31:14.789 --> 31:16.355
He can't keep anything down.

31:17.725 --> 31:19.458
Doc, we are trying our best!

31:19.460 --> 31:23.028
What kind of doctor are you, anyway?

31:25.133 --> 31:28.300
Doc said baby got a flu.

31:28.302 --> 31:29.969
He said keep the temperature down,

31:29.971 --> 31:31.303
maybe he'll calm down enough

31:31.305 --> 31:33.105
we can ger some liquids in his stomach.

31:33.107 --> 31:37.409
He's... so sick.

31:37.411 --> 31:40.012
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

31:40.014 --> 31:43.582
Hey. Hey, we got this.

31:43.584 --> 31:45.384
All right?

31:47.855 --> 31:50.923
Hey, shh.

31:50.925 --> 31:53.058
It's... It's... It's too noisy out there.

31:53.060 --> 31:55.661
It's... It's too loud,
it's t-too loud, too loud.

31:55.663 --> 31:59.331
Okay, um, um, Dean, Dean,
where are your earphones?

31:59.333 --> 32:01.901
I-I didn't put them on because I
didn't think they were sexual enough.

32:01.903 --> 32:04.103
Well, they are on you.

32:04.105 --> 32:05.456
- Take them.
- Okay.

32:05.458 --> 32:06.527
Listen to me.

32:06.529 --> 32:09.208
I need you to reach
deep down inside of yourself,

32:09.210 --> 32:11.477
grab your courage by the balls,

32:11.479 --> 32:13.112
throw on your fighting gloves,

32:13.114 --> 32:15.314
and go out there and show them
what you're made of.

32:15.316 --> 32:17.716
I need you to do this
for the rest of the boys.

32:17.718 --> 32:20.886
Are you going to let them down,
or are you going to fight?

32:20.888 --> 32:22.388
D-Desi was right. This is a bad idea.

32:22.390 --> 32:24.256
This... I can't, can't.
This is a bad idea.

32:24.258 --> 32:26.525
O-Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

32:26.527 --> 32:29.028
Shh. I won't do the scary voice.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.229
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay?

32:30.231 --> 32:31.697
All right? It's just me.

32:31.699 --> 32:32.998
Just Polly, okay?

32:33.000 --> 32:35.167
Can... Can I... Can I have your hand?

32:35.169 --> 32:37.436
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

32:37.438 --> 32:40.339
I can only guess
how hard this is for you.

32:40.341 --> 32:42.741
But I've known you a long time,

32:42.743 --> 32:44.843
and I know you got this.

32:44.845 --> 32:49.815
I've seen moves on you that
would put those boys to shame.

32:49.817 --> 32:51.828
But more importantly, Dean,

32:52.553 --> 32:55.454
I know deep inside,
you know you got this, too.

32:56.124 --> 32:59.258
Don't be the one to hold yourself back.

32:59.260 --> 33:01.927
You shine your light.

33:02.506 --> 33:04.296
You blind them bitches.

33:07.535 --> 33:08.634
Okay.

33:08.636 --> 33:11.003
Okay, okay. Somebody hand me a damn mike.

33:11.005 --> 33:13.072
All right.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.074
86 those umbrellas.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.476
We're going to plan B, boys.

33:17.478 --> 33:18.577
You go out there,

33:18.579 --> 33:22.181
and you stripper dance for your life.

33:22.183 --> 33:24.149
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:24.151 --> 33:28.287

out there in Palmetto.

33:28.289 --> 33:31.757

33:31.759 --> 33:37.363

Hi, hi!

Whoo!

34:20.841 --> 34:25.344

34:31.284 --> 34:32.885
He's good.

34:32.887 --> 34:34.920
He's really good.

34:42.697 --> 34:45.230

35:14.895 --> 35:17.396

35:17.398 --> 35:18.597
Hey.

35:18.599 --> 35:20.065
Yeah.

35:20.560 --> 35:21.900
All right.

35:21.902 --> 35:23.702
Breaking fevers like a boss.

35:24.439 --> 35:26.238
He finna break some hearts like one, too.

35:27.742 --> 35:29.174
Right, little squirt?

35:29.176 --> 35:30.709
Come here.

35:30.711 --> 35:33.412
Let's take a nap. I bet he's tired.

35:57.671 --> 36:00.506
Deannie, I am so proud of you.

36:00.508 --> 36:04.276
Thank you, thank... thank you.

36:04.278 --> 36:06.779
Wow, is... is that from him?

36:06.781 --> 36:08.547

- Yeah.

36:08.549 --> 36:11.450
Let... Let me talk to you
for one second, baby.

36:11.452 --> 36:14.820
Dean, tonight, Gregory proposed,

36:14.822 --> 36:17.556

36:17.558 --> 36:19.758
But I just want you to know...

36:19.760 --> 36:23.373
nothing is going to change
for the two of us.

36:24.556 --> 36:26.665
Ch-Change is inevitable, Des.

36:26.667 --> 36:27.800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:27.802 --> 36:30.936
Baby, but... but I love you,

36:30.938 --> 36:33.305
We gonna always be together.

36:34.141 --> 36:35.541
Yeah.

36:35.543 --> 36:36.675
Yeah!

36:36.677 --> 36:40.045
Deannie, you shook your shit
so good tonight!

36:40.047 --> 36:41.747
Whoa!

36:41.749 --> 36:44.817
Back off, ladies,
he is my private dancer.

36:46.020 --> 36:47.786
Great turnout.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.889
Dean, you can lead
Raining Men every month.

36:52.193 --> 36:53.625
The best night of my life!

36:53.627 --> 36:56.495
You guys, I got to go.

36:56.497 --> 36:58.831
Ken is not feeling very well,
but I love you.

36:58.833 --> 37:00.232
Good job, Pol.

37:00.234 --> 37:01.767
- Congratulations.
- Bye, Pol.

37:01.769 --> 37:04.636
The best night of their life
for other people, too.

37:04.638 --> 37:07.339
Congratulations, bride and groom.

37:07.341 --> 37:09.808
Because this is
impromptu engagement party,

37:09.810 --> 37:13.479
on the house with Clicquot bottles, now!

37:13.481 --> 37:17.583
Whoo!

37:17.585 --> 37:19.585
- Hey, it's Roller. Leave it.
- You brother never.

37:19.587 --> 37:21.820
Hey, let this be a lesson to you, boy.

37:21.822 --> 37:24.590
You don't answer your phone,
you're gonna miss all the fun.

37:24.592 --> 37:26.758
Get it, get it!

37:26.760 --> 37:27.960
All right, boys.

37:27.962 --> 37:30.762
- Go kill us some Siberian shitholes.
- Whoo!

37:34.134 --> 37:35.701
Get it, get it, get it, get it.

37:45.092 --> 37:47.055
- God.
- We're bad friends.

37:48.026 --> 37:50.313
We should be celebrating Desna.

37:50.314 --> 37:52.280
Yay, Desna.

37:52.282 --> 37:54.549
Desna's fiancé is leaving.

37:54.551 --> 37:56.318
I think he celebrated enough.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.820
Take me home.

37:58.822 --> 38:00.055
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:03.327 --> 38:06.161
Ooh.

38:06.163 --> 38:08.697
You look like shit, sugar.

38:08.699 --> 38:09.931
I feel it, too.

38:09.933 --> 38:11.166
It's been a rough day.

38:11.168 --> 38:13.235
Well, I see your mama left.

38:13.237 --> 38:15.003
Yeah, she went with, Marnie and Malik

38:15.005 --> 38:16.471
to get frozen yogurt.

38:18.706 --> 38:20.277
She's slipping away.

38:20.279 --> 38:21.843
What do you mean, "She's slipping away"?

38:21.845 --> 38:23.145
She's just making friends.

38:31.989 --> 38:33.522
Ooh.

38:33.524 --> 38:36.258
That Jew food repeats on you, doesn't it?

38:37.528 --> 38:38.894
No, she wasn't.

38:38.896 --> 38:41.296
Dancing is... dancing is
a workout, Virginia.

38:41.298 --> 38:43.231
I burned 6,700 calorie... well, 7,800,

38:43.233 --> 38:45.200
if you count the pre-show intercourse.

38:45.202 --> 38:47.202
Okay.
And you look good doing it, too.

38:47.204 --> 38:48.737
- Yeah, boy.
- Thanks.

38:48.739 --> 38:49.838
Let's carb out tonight.

38:49.840 --> 38:53.175
Ooh, spikin' our shakes,
so who's driving?

38:53.177 --> 38:55.177
I guess it's me.

38:55.179 --> 38:57.078
- Hey, hey, Uncle Daddy.
- Hey.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.748
Got something special.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.072
Come have a taste.

39:10.727 --> 39:12.561
You're doing awesome, don't...

39:16.099 --> 39:17.732
What is happening?

39:17.734 --> 39:19.401
We got to get out of here.

39:24.007 --> 39:26.208
Y'all having fun in my club?!

39:28.245 --> 39:30.512
It should still be my club!

39:30.514 --> 39:33.715
My family's been here
since President Jackson sent

39:33.717 --> 39:36.685
them cryin' red-faced Indians
on their merry trail.

39:36.687 --> 39:41.089
I got to sit here
while this, egg-sucking...

39:43.327 --> 39:45.227
fresh-off-the-boat bitch

39:45.229 --> 39:47.495
thinks she gonna take it from me?

39:55.906 --> 39:57.572
Shit!

40:54.865 --> 40:57.132
No!

41:11.357 --> 41:13.492
- Shit!
- Hold on, Bryce!

41:13.494 --> 41:15.294
Look at me, you stay with me,
Bryce Husser, okay?

41:15.296 --> 41:17.329
- The Russian goons behind us?
- I don't think so.

41:17.331 --> 41:19.264
Look at me, baby.

41:19.266 --> 41:20.732
- Keep him awake, Jenn!
- That's what I'm doing, Des!

41:20.734 --> 41:22.034
Look at me. Look at me.

41:22.036 --> 41:24.303
Baby boy ain't going nowhere,
you hear me?

41:24.305 --> 41:25.304
You hear me?!

41:25.306 --> 41:27.372
You ain't going nowhere, boy.

41:27.374 --> 41:28.665
I will follow you into the afterlife

41:28.667 --> 41:30.320
and track you back myself.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.044
Hey, hey, don't leave me.

41:34.248 --> 41:36.748
We need a doctor. He's been shot!

41:36.750 --> 41:38.183
Everybody, come out here!

41:38.185 --> 41:39.818
Hurry!

41:39.820 --> 41:41.553
Stay with him, baby boy, right over here!

41:41.555 --> 41:42.954
Come on now! Hurry up!

41:42.956 --> 41:44.790
- Come on, baby!
- Careful!

41:44.792 --> 41:46.504
Stay with us, baby boy!

41:46.506 --> 41:48.670
We got a sunken chest wound!
I need an OR, stat!

41:48.672 --> 41:50.028
- Go!
- Stay with us, boy!

41:50.030 --> 41:52.098
Stay with us, my boy! Stay with us, boy!

41:52.100 --> 41:54.164
I'm so sorry. Come on, now.

41:54.189 --> 41:55.588
Do you think... Do you think
he's going to live?

41:55.590 --> 41:57.323
Do you think he knows I'm sorry?

41:57.325 --> 41:58.825
- Do you think he knows I'm sorry, Des?
- Yeah.

41:58.827 --> 42:00.093
Okay. Okay.

42:00.095 --> 42:02.962
Come on, baby boy, I'm with you!

42:02.964 --> 42:04.898
- Stay with us!
- Bryce!

42:04.900 --> 42:08.101
Maybe I could put together a sit-down,

42:08.103 --> 42:10.003
just so nobody gets hurt?

42:10.005 --> 42:11.771
Okay. Great.

42:11.773 --> 42:14.152
So, you just gonna talk, right?

42:14.154 --> 42:15.975
Yes. Talk.

42:15.977 --> 42:17.777
Just talking.

42:53.782 --> 42:56.616
Those shitheads tried to kill me tonight.

42:56.618 --> 42:58.818
I won't be able to sleep.

43:00.155 --> 43:01.396
You had too much fun.

43:02.090 --> 43:03.523
Exactly.

43:03.525 --> 43:06.526
But melatonin doesn't do shit
for me anymore.

43:06.528 --> 43:07.627
Doesn't work.

43:07.629 --> 43:09.684
Was that in my bag?

43:11.136 --> 43:16.037
So... tell me again.

43:16.039 --> 43:17.697
Please tell me again.

43:17.699 --> 43:20.150
Again? Okay.

43:21.843 --> 43:23.508
I went down on my knees.

43:23.509 --> 43:24.709
Ooh.

43:24.711 --> 43:27.478
Dear diary, romantic.

43:27.480 --> 43:31.198
Little beach sunset.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.883
Hallmark Hall of Fame.

43:32.885 --> 43:34.852
The whole thing.

43:34.854 --> 43:36.387
Can I get some schmaltz

43:36.389 --> 43:38.422
on top of the schmaltz?!

43:39.692 --> 43:42.093
And... she said yes.

43:42.095 --> 43:43.327
God.

43:43.329 --> 43:45.663
Can you believe...
she really thinks you love her?

43:45.665 --> 43:48.099
Yes, I know it's pathetic.

43:48.101 --> 43:52.937
You look beautiful without makeup.

43:58.878 --> 44:01.012
Boop.

44:05.251 --> 44:08.119
What you going to do for me?

44:11.591 --> 44:13.557
Ouch!

44:13.559 --> 44:16.260
Easy. Easy, yeah.

44:17.497 --> 44:19.597
Aw, yeah.

44:24.704 --> 44:26.664
Yeah, just like that, yeah.
