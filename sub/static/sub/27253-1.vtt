01:36.120 --> 01:41.080
Hmm.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.360
Beautiful.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.560
They command the Pope himself
from Rome.

02:09.640 --> 02:10.640
Why not?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.880
If the Pope owes you money.

02:28.840 --> 02:29.840
Who's there?

02:29.920 --> 02:34.120
Stop it! You all know he was a tyrant!
He ruined anyone that got in his way!

02:34.200 --> 02:35.880
Who's there--?

02:35.960 --> 02:37.840
Stop pretending!
You know what he was!

02:37.920 --> 02:40.440
-You liar! Liar!
-A monster!

02:42.160 --> 02:44.480
-You liar!
-We can't grieve this man,

02:44.560 --> 02:45.640
we should celebrate!

03:04.280 --> 03:10.040
What the people of Florence
owe Giovanni de' Medici,

03:10.120 --> 03:14.000
they could never repay in gold.

03:14.080 --> 03:19.760
The Lord blessed
his family with great wealth.

03:19.840 --> 03:25.160
Yet he acted not from greed,
but from conviction.

03:25.240 --> 03:29.720
Conviction that wealth
was not to be hoarded by the few,

03:31.160 --> 03:34.840
but used to provide for the many.

03:36.560 --> 03:41.320
That power was not to be used
to enrich the strong,

03:41.400 --> 03:44.600
but to raise up the weak.

04:13.480 --> 04:17.240
Care for some wine?
I think we could all use a glass.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.520
Go drink elsewhere.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.040
With pleasure.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.640
As soon as you tell me
what your friend here

04:23.720 --> 04:25.200
whispered in your ear.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.680
It's none of your concern.

04:26.760 --> 04:32.560
If it has to do with this family, Cosimo,
it is very much my concern.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.320
Father was murdered.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.440
What?

04:51.520 --> 04:55.040
He always tasted the grapes
on his morning walks.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.920
Only, this time,
they were painted with hemlock.

05:00.160 --> 05:03.360
Marco had the surgeon
study his liver to be sure.

05:03.440 --> 05:07.840
- Do you know who did it?
- Power breeds enemies.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.160
You father had many.

05:09.240 --> 05:12.120
None greater than Albizzi.
He's always hated us.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.240
Not always.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.080
-We must inform the Signoria.
-We must do nothing of the kind.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.080
Did Father teach you nothing?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.880
Perception is power.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.880
And we must appear powerful,
now more than ever.

05:30.960 --> 05:34.520
His murder demands justice, Cosimo.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.400
Alerting his killer,
will only make him harder to catch.

05:38.480 --> 05:43.320
I will have justice.
Once I know who did it.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.840
-I'm sorry to disturb you.
-You never disturb, Ugo. What is it?

05:50.920 --> 05:53.440
This just arrived.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.880
It's from Albizzi.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.720
He wants to meet at the fulling mill.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.320
Messer Medici.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.280
Messer Medici.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.520
Strange that you would ask to meet here.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.760
This old mill is where it all started,
isn't it?

06:22.840 --> 06:25.760
Where your father began his climb
from peasant to monarch.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.680
My father held no such title.

06:27.760 --> 06:32.240
No, Giovanni de' Medici
was far too clever to claim a title.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.800
But everyone knows he ruled
this so-called republic.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.880
He lined the people's pockets
and gave them a voice

06:37.960 --> 06:40.240
just loud enough to make them feel strong.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.200
What is it you want, Rinaldo?

06:43.280 --> 06:47.240
-His position in the Signoria.
-Oh.

06:47.320 --> 06:52.240
Replacement will be selected tomorrow.
And I expect it to be you.

06:52.320 --> 06:56.280
If I am so fortunate
to have my name drawn at random.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.120
Random yet, remarkably,

06:58.200 --> 07:03.080
the restricted council is always seated
with a name loyal to the Medici.

07:08.280 --> 07:12.720
My family has had...
differences with yours.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.480
But in matters of the Signoria at least,
we had an understanding with your father.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.320
He did not challenge
the established order.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.360
And you're here to ensure
that I won't either.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.800
Hmm.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.680
I am my father's son.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.000
It's not quite a "no" is it?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.360
You certainly are
your father's son, Cosimo.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.600
I fear you're even more
your father than he was.

07:52.600 --> 07:57.120
Know this, if you challenge us,
your children will be back at this mill,

07:57.200 --> 08:00.880
selling filthy wool like your late father.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.320
-Piero, are you quite all right?
-I'm fine, Grandmother.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.600
Then stop making a spectacle of yourself
with those tears.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.880
Your grandfather would want you
to show strength.

08:40.680 --> 08:43.080
- Where is my son?
- He went out this morning.

08:43.160 --> 08:45.880
- I asked, where is he?
- He had a meeting, Mother.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.160
Marco Bello's gone to find him.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.400
Missing dinner.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.240
His father's not been
in the grave one day,

08:53.320 --> 08:55.760
and already he neglects his family. Hmm.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.040
Cosimo de' Medici, have you seen him?

10:23.120 --> 10:25.680
-I'm concerned about you, Cosimo.
-I'm fine.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.760
You vanished for hours.

10:28.760 --> 10:31.200
What happened this afternoon
with Marco Bello and Lorenzo?

10:34.080 --> 10:35.120
Nothing of important.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.280
There's always been
a distance between us, Cosimo.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.600
But I have been a good and loyal wife
these many years.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.760
And now you bear a heavy burden.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.640
The weight of this family,
this bank, this republic.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.840
It would be enough to break another man.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.280
If you would allow me,
I could help to lessen it.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.680
Where's your brother?

12:30.640 --> 12:31.800
He had an errand.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.520
-Oh, God, Roberto!
-He's early.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.480
-No, he's late.
-Oh.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.080
That means I'm late! Hey!

12:47.160 --> 12:48.520
Hey!

12:58.520 --> 13:00.240
-Hey!
-Sorry!

13:08.360 --> 13:09.840
Sorry, Father.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.320
-Sorry. I was, uh--
-Is it new?

13:14.560 --> 13:18.920
Hmm? Your cloak. Is it new?

13:22.800 --> 13:24.880
-Yes.
-Oh.

13:26.040 --> 13:29.400
- Very nice. May I see it?
- Of course.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.080
Whoa! Very fine.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.920
My father would sell wool like this,
but only to the wealthiest nobles.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.320
-What?
-No! No.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.240
No, no, no, no!

13:45.320 --> 13:47.240
That will be all, Ugo.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.760
What did you do that for?

13:53.840 --> 13:58.400
The Medici do not call attention
to themselves with fancy dress.

14:01.040 --> 14:05.200
-I have money. Why not enjoy it?
-You have my money.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.080
Stand up!

14:28.160 --> 14:30.120
-You wanted to see us, Father?
-Yes.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.600
This is a letter from Rome.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.880
The Pope has died.

14:34.960 --> 14:38.360
The Curia will act swiftly to replace him.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.880
-How does this concern us?
-Pack your things. You'll see.

15:04.480 --> 15:08.680
-You spend hours studying the Duomo.
-Yes, Father.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.600
Have you considered
why the old Florentines

15:10.680 --> 15:14.520
built a cathedral so enormous
no one could complete it?

15:14.600 --> 15:19.560
It was folly.
Their ambition exceeded their ability.

15:19.640 --> 15:23.360
They knew it was impossible.
The cathedral is too grand, too glorious.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.680
If they knew it could not be completed,
why build it?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.000
Because they had dreams, Cosimo.

15:30.080 --> 15:35.600
That God would produce future generations
clever enough to realize those dreams.

15:37.680 --> 15:41.680
That could be me, Father.
If I apply myself to my drawings.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.760
It could be you.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.320
But not with your drawings.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.920
The dome will not be completed
by an artist or an architect.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.560
It will be completed by a man
who can marshal

15:51.640 --> 15:54.400
the vast resources needed
to accomplish the task.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.640
A man of great wealth and power.

15:59.840 --> 16:04.880
I know you fancy yourself
an artist, Cosimo.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.800
But I too have dreams.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.880
For this family, for this city.

16:12.400 --> 16:17.280
And when I die, it'll be up to my sons

16:17.360 --> 16:21.440
and their son's sons
to realize those dreams.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.760
Come back next time,
I'll give you a real blessing!

16:54.400 --> 16:58.000
-Giovanni de' Medici.
-Admiral.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.440
These are my sons, Cosimo and Lorenzo.

17:04.680 --> 17:05.880
Lorenzo.

17:07.800 --> 17:12.120
Your father has come up
with a rather remarkable proposal, boys.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.400
At present, Holy Mother Church
is fatally divided.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.600
There's a false pontiff in Avignon,
another one in Naples.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.240
With Pope Alexander dead,

17:20.320 --> 17:24.800
our hopes depend on a strong successor
to purify and unite the Church.

17:25.880 --> 17:26.880
You seek financing?

17:26.960 --> 17:31.400
-To buy votes, among the Curia in Rome.
-Bribery.

17:31.480 --> 17:35.560
- I believe it's pronounced "lobbying".

17:35.640 --> 17:38.320
-And your candidate?
-Why me, of course!

17:41.480 --> 17:45.680
You're not seriously thinking
of giving money to a, a pirate?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.440
No, no, no, a condottiero!

17:47.520 --> 17:51.560
- Not just that, but...

17:51.640 --> 17:55.040
an ordained cardinal
and voting member of the Curia.

17:56.840 --> 17:59.480
He seeks to unite and purify
by buying his way into the papacy?

17:59.560 --> 18:04.280
It is sometimes necessary to do some bad
in order to achieve a much greater good.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.400
What collateral do you offer?

18:11.480 --> 18:12.960
- None at all.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.080
Now, I'm afraid if I fail,
there's little hope

18:15.160 --> 18:20.680
of you recovering your investment,
but if I succeed,

18:20.760 --> 18:24.240
the Medici become bankers to the Pope.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.120
All the tithes and taxes
that flow to the Curia

18:27.200 --> 18:31.880
from London to Tunisia
would pass through our bank.

18:37.160 --> 18:41.040
In a stroke, we would become
the most successful bankers in Europe.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.920
No one could call us usurers anymore,
not if the Pope was our client.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.800
What? Usurers!

18:46.880 --> 18:50.680
Usurers make money by charging interest
to the desperate.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.880
Our profit comes from trade and credit.

18:52.960 --> 18:56.280
We give opportunity to those
who otherwise would have none.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.840
And never forget that. All right.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.960
You will go to Rome at once. So will you.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.320
- Me?
- Yes.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.280
Lorenzo is good
at convincing people, not me.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.840
Only one of you can lead the bank
if I die.

19:10.160 --> 19:14.280
- He wants to pit us against each other.
- Yes.

19:15.600 --> 19:19.920
-No, we won't let him divide us, will we?
-Never.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.800
Today, with heavy hearts,

19:24.880 --> 19:28.640
we choose a successor
for the late Giovanni de' Medici.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.720
Oh, the suspense is killing me.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.320
The successor to Giovanni de' Medici

19:58.400 --> 20:01.960
shall be Cosimo de' Medici!

20:06.800 --> 20:07.960
They're cheating.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.400
You are cheating! You are cheating!

20:11.480 --> 20:14.560
You are cheating! You are cheating!

20:37.360 --> 20:40.200
My father understood that...

20:40.280 --> 20:45.040
money should be used to allow all men
to benefit from their toil.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.840
Not just those born to rank and title.

20:48.920 --> 20:51.160
That is the Florence he helped build.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.400
He may be gone,

20:56.680 --> 21:00.920
but what he stood for,
cannot be destroyed.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.520
Message for the Signoria.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.960
Visconti, Duke of Milan,
has attacked Lucca.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.720
- The city walls have fallen.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.000
I call for immediate adjournment!

21:25.080 --> 21:26.920
- Adjourned!

21:28.400 --> 21:32.080
The important families must call for war,
to protect our interests in Lucca.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.720
But the merchants
whose livelihood depends on trade,

21:34.800 --> 21:36.200
war is not in their best interest.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.520
You will support us, Cosimo,
just as your father did.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.080
Or you'll find his seat
needs filling again.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.520
Father!

22:01.320 --> 22:04.200
-Is it true there will be war?
-It is possible.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.880
Piero was meant to go with you today,

22:05.960 --> 22:08.000
to see you take your father's seat
in the Signoria.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.320
It's time I started working with you.

22:13.400 --> 22:17.000
Is there nothing else you dream of being,
other than a banker?

22:17.080 --> 22:19.800
It's what Grandfather wished. Is it not?

22:31.160 --> 22:32.240
He is your heir.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.560
-I do not need to be reminded.
-But he is brilliant!

22:34.640 --> 22:37.120
He has a mind for books,
not for the affairs of men.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.120
At least give him a chance.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.640
You were his age when you started
learning from your father.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.760
Piero is not me.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.920
Welcome to Rome!

23:01.040 --> 23:04.040
The sooner we can leave this stinkhole,
the better.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.440
Twenty-three cardinals vote for the Pope.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.720
We have three weeks
to persuade 12 of them to elect me.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.120
-But you're among the 23.
-You see?

23:12.200 --> 23:15.440
We already have one vote.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.280
Cardinal Cossa!

23:27.840 --> 23:31.080
Are you entirely serious?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.560
Entirely.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.800
As you are doubtless aware,
Cardinal Cossa is highly qualified...

23:35.880 --> 23:37.800
And fully ordained.

23:39.200 --> 23:42.520
Cardinal Attavanti has my vote.
I see no reason to change it.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.920
How many reasons does
your Eminence need?

23:56.880 --> 23:58.080
You see, Your Eminence,

23:58.160 --> 24:01.080
we deeply believe in the candidacy
of Cardinal Cossa.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.320
And we are prepared to invest

24:03.400 --> 24:06.720
to see that the Church unites
behind a strong people.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.520
Not bad.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Not as good as me, of course.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.680
-Hmm. But not bad.
-You're an artist?

25:29.760 --> 25:33.240
-Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi.
-That's a mouthful.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.040
I'm called Donatello.

25:36.320 --> 25:39.400
-You're not from here, are you?
-Florence.

25:39.480 --> 25:44.040
-So am I. Messer...
-Medici.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.840
Medici?

25:46.960 --> 25:49.600
-Then you are a banker.
-I am...

25:52.320 --> 25:53.840
I am here to learn.

25:55.840 --> 25:58.240
A banker who wants to be an artist.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.720
All right then, Medici.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.600
Come with me.

26:16.560 --> 26:19.160
-What is this place?
-My workshop.

26:21.560 --> 26:24.960
Bertolo! This is my new friend, Cosimo.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.840
-Enchanted. Have a cup.
-Thank you.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.960
The wisdom of the ancient.
Salvaged from the streets.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.840
This is why you came to Rome?

26:39.920 --> 26:42.280
It seems the only artists
who have something to teach me

26:42.360 --> 26:44.640
died a thousand years ago.

26:44.720 --> 26:45.760
See?

26:50.520 --> 26:52.400
- They have no clothes.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.240
You are a banker, aren't you?

26:55.480 --> 26:58.040
Are we not made in God's image?

26:59.360 --> 27:03.000
By showing the beauty of man,
do we not depict the beauty of God?

27:04.320 --> 27:06.040
You said you wanted to learn.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.480
Come.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.600
Start there.

28:41.960 --> 28:43.000
I...

28:44.200 --> 28:48.040
-I hope you didn't mind me staring.
-Why would I?

28:48.120 --> 28:50.320
-You were almost...
-Naked, hm.

28:51.920 --> 28:56.200
I wasn't sure you'd noticed.
Your eyes didn't look down once.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.160
What's your name?

29:01.240 --> 29:03.680
-Bianca.
-I'm Cosimo.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.800
Cosimo.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.160
Oh.

29:16.040 --> 29:19.400
-Will I see you again?
-I hope so.

29:20.440 --> 29:21.600
I hope so too.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.720
Come, brother, there's work to be done.

29:46.800 --> 29:52.960
Myself, I'm inclined to favor...
Cardinal Colonna.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.600
Your Eminence,
permit a small donation towards--

30:11.680 --> 30:13.080
- Go away!
- Hey!

30:28.640 --> 30:29.920
Cardinal Torelli.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.800
A moment of your time.
Holy Mother Church...

32:30.920 --> 32:35.400
-Where are you going?
-I have to go to work.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.360
I thought you were an artist.

32:38.360 --> 32:42.760
- I would very much like to be.
- Why?

32:42.840 --> 32:47.240
If you have a job, artists make no money.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.240
There is more to life than money,
you know.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.840
Like what?

32:52.880 --> 32:54.040
Like beauty.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.120
Like you.

33:00.040 --> 33:03.480
Beauty doesn't matter
without food in your stomach,

33:03.560 --> 33:06.840
clothes on your back, or a roof.

33:09.640 --> 33:13.920
Where are you from?
What did you do before this?

33:18.200 --> 33:19.720
I was a laundress.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.280
I will be again when I leave this place.

33:31.680 --> 33:36.680
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?

33:36.760 --> 33:40.240
Are you so depraved as to believe
there is no honor or faith in Rome?

33:40.320 --> 33:42.240
Your Eminence,
we were merely hoping to help guide--

33:42.320 --> 33:45.840
I know precisely what you are hoping,
Cardinal Cossa.

33:45.920 --> 33:49.040
How dare you presume
we are all as corrupt as yourself?

33:50.640 --> 33:51.920
I serve God.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.520
And you?

33:54.920 --> 33:58.520
This usurer, with social pretentions.

34:03.560 --> 34:05.520
Another time, perhaps.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.440
How's it going with Cossa?

34:14.320 --> 34:15.920
Oh, so you remembered about that, did you?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.960
I'm sorry. I know I haven't exactly
been carrying my weight.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.000
No. You've done nothing.

34:22.320 --> 34:25.200
And to answer your question,
it isn't going particularly well.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.240
We have five days left, and all we have
done is depleted our funds.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.320
Where have you been?

34:29.400 --> 34:32.440
You're far better at this than I am,
Lorenzo.

34:32.520 --> 34:33.920
Is that's supposed to be an excuse?

34:34.000 --> 34:35.600
I don't want to be a banker,
you know that.

34:35.680 --> 34:39.320
We don't have a choice. Neither of us do.

35:03.720 --> 35:08.120
-It's time for mass.
-Close the door. I want a word.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.160
We've understood some things
about who murdered Father.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.280
Such as?

35:17.360 --> 35:19.560
Whoever he was,
he had a classical education.

35:20.640 --> 35:24.080
Poisoning fruit was a trick used
on Emperor Augustus.

35:24.160 --> 35:25.760
His wife knew he had his food tasted,

35:25.840 --> 35:28.840
so she killed him by having the figs
on the tree daubed with poison.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.080
Hm. Well, that certainly narrows the list.

35:32.160 --> 35:36.000
Can I speak with you? Alone?

35:46.520 --> 35:50.000
You do know the Albizzi
are rallying support for a vote

35:50.080 --> 35:52.360
in the Signoria to authorize
war against Lucca.

35:52.440 --> 35:56.320
His men are in the streets
as we speak readying for battle.

35:56.400 --> 35:59.200
The families need this war to preserve
the revenue from the properties there.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.720
Yes.

36:07.880 --> 36:09.560
How will you vote?

36:14.720 --> 36:17.680
Father would have gone along to get along.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.640
-He would have voted with them.
-You hold Father's seat now.

36:22.840 --> 36:26.160
And if you oppose the war, then many
others in the Signoria will vote with you.

36:26.240 --> 36:29.040
And the families will be at war with us.

36:30.760 --> 36:34.200
Now, Albizzi warned me
against opposing them. I...

36:35.920 --> 36:38.040
Albizzi had a classical education.

36:39.080 --> 36:41.840
And when he was a boy,
he played in that vineyard many times.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.320
I know.

36:44.880 --> 36:49.480
If he killed our father,
he did it for one reason: to weaken us.

36:49.560 --> 36:52.880
And now you have a chance to weaken him.

36:52.960 --> 36:57.560
If you do not take that, Cosimo,
then you may not get another.

36:59.640 --> 37:04.960
In nomine Patris,
et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.240
Amen.

37:06.320 --> 37:07.640
Oremus.

37:09.200 --> 37:13.560
Deus qui beatam Mariam semper Virginem

37:13.640 --> 37:16.320
Spiritus Sancti abitaculum

37:16.400 --> 37:20.320
odierna die in templo presentare voluisti

37:20.400 --> 37:24.480
praesta quaesumus
ut eius intercessionem

37:24.560 --> 37:27.760
in templo gloriae
tuea presentari mereamur.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.600
Deus qui beatam Maria semper Virginem,

37:34.680 --> 37:37.120
Spiritus Sancti abitatuculum...

37:39.560 --> 37:42.360
You must forgive my intrusion
upon your devotions, my Lord.

37:44.560 --> 37:48.520
You had me break the law
by conducting an autopsy on your father.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.320
And yet I notice that word
of his poisoning has not spread.

37:54.800 --> 37:58.200
Would I be correct in assuming
that your Excellency...

37:58.280 --> 38:01.160
prefers to keep
this melancholy fact a secret?

38:01.240 --> 38:02.240
What's your point?

38:02.320 --> 38:06.680
My point is that someone does know

38:06.760 --> 38:09.560
what befell your lamented father.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.480
Someone besides his murderer.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.360
You know?

38:15.440 --> 38:20.560
For 100 Florins,
my lips are sealed forever.

38:21.760 --> 38:26.440
In nomine Patris,
et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

38:26.520 --> 38:27.640
Amen.

38:29.600 --> 38:33.080
- Father and his debts...
- Let's do something about it.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.680
May I have a word?

38:44.080 --> 38:46.560
I went to the piazza, as instructed.

38:46.640 --> 38:51.240
Di Cecco says 100 Florins
is nothing to a man such as yourself.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.920
Tomorrow he wants a thousand.

38:56.040 --> 38:57.160
Frighten him.

39:00.120 --> 39:05.080
-How long have you known me?
-Eighteen years now.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.360
You found me on the street.

39:06.440 --> 39:09.240
I was bloodied and beaten.
You brought me into your home.

39:09.320 --> 39:12.000
It has been my honor
to serve you ever since.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.920
You've done more than serve, Marco.
You've been like a brother.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.720
Then you know you must trust me.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.280
I've known men like the surgeon
all my life, and I'm telling you:

39:20.360 --> 39:22.360
he will never go away.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.240
Not until he's made to go away.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.240
Frighten him, Marco.

39:33.480 --> 39:34.480
Nothing more.

39:58.720 --> 39:59.880
Bianca?

40:24.880 --> 40:26.480
-Will you betray us?
-Please, just let me--

40:26.560 --> 40:29.560
Bertolo is only 19.
Must he be put to death for sodomy?

40:30.880 --> 40:31.960
Must I?

40:32.040 --> 40:33.840
--Cosimo.

40:41.560 --> 40:46.480
- I was afraid you'd left.
- Just for bread, that's all.

40:46.560 --> 40:49.680
I don't want you to leave, ever again.
Do you understand?

40:49.760 --> 40:52.560
Cosimo, don't be silly.

40:52.640 --> 40:56.520
You are the son of a banker.
And I am a laundress.

40:56.600 --> 40:59.400
I am in love with you, Bianca.

40:59.480 --> 41:02.480
-I am in love with you.
-As if that mattered.

41:08.880 --> 41:09.880
One day, soon,

41:10.960 --> 41:14.520
I'm going to take you to meet my brother,
and my father.

41:16.160 --> 41:20.520
-You're a dreamer, Cosimo.
-That's exactly what I am.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.000
--What is it?

41:40.960 --> 41:43.040
A letter from my father.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.280
The Albizzi have been sowing bribes
the other way.

41:45.360 --> 41:48.160
-What?
-We're nearly bankrupt.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.960
It's a pity. I could have helped.

41:55.040 --> 41:59.680
-And I could have cleansed the Church.
-I've just spoken to Cardinal Mosca.

42:00.680 --> 42:01.720
He's with us.

42:03.840 --> 42:06.720
But how did you manage that?
There's no money left to bribe him with.

42:06.800 --> 42:11.360
the need to unite and purify the Church.

42:11.440 --> 42:12.800
There, you see!

42:12.880 --> 42:15.760
Now, if we could get Orsini to switch,

42:15.840 --> 42:17.920
then Attavanti
and the other three would follow.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.440
We might as well wish for the sun
to rise at night.

42:20.520 --> 42:23.920
I don't know why we're here.
Orsini will never switch! He hates me!

42:27.360 --> 42:28.960
-You there!
-Cardinal Orsini--

42:29.040 --> 42:32.400
-You must leave here at once!
-I am a member of the Curia.

42:32.480 --> 42:36.120
Sadly, this is true, but they are not.

42:36.200 --> 42:39.400
Go, or I will have you thrown out. Guards!

42:40.400 --> 42:43.520
- Guards!
- We're going.

42:43.600 --> 42:44.880
We're leaving!

43:17.200 --> 43:21.240
-What is it, Claudio?
-Your son Cosimo is in love.

43:22.280 --> 43:23.280
With a...

43:25.560 --> 43:26.560
With whom?

43:27.600 --> 43:31.160
A peasant. A laundress, Messer.

44:12.480 --> 44:14.880
- Sir calls us to the next ballot.
Thank you.

44:17.800 --> 44:19.160
First ballot, nil.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.680
Food.

44:25.760 --> 44:28.680
Now, if we had gold,
there's how you get it in.

44:30.080 --> 44:32.880
I don't need gold. I need paper.

44:35.160 --> 44:36.560
What are you going to do?

44:40.800 --> 44:43.640
Something bad,
in order to do something good.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.200
Donatello?

46:21.640 --> 46:22.840
What happened?

46:23.840 --> 46:25.680
The Curia Guards shut us down.

46:25.760 --> 46:28.720
-What for?
-Charges of sodomy.

46:28.800 --> 46:30.880
Someone reported us.

46:32.600 --> 46:35.680
-Where is Bianca?
-She's gone.

46:35.760 --> 46:38.160
-What do you mean gone?
-She said she was leaving.

46:39.280 --> 46:40.600
Someplace you'd never find her.

46:43.240 --> 46:47.920
She was scared, Cosimo.
She'll never come back.

47:03.680 --> 47:05.880
You should feel proud.

47:06.920 --> 47:09.720
- Lorenzo and I did this together.
- Yes.

47:09.800 --> 47:15.040
But it was your idea to blackmail Orsini.
Your brother never would have dared.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.240
-I didn't want him to tell you.
-He had to.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.920
He knew in his heart
you should lead the bank.

47:58.120 --> 48:00.680
A case for war has been made.

48:02.680 --> 48:07.440
Duke Visconti
and his hired general Sforza,

48:07.520 --> 48:10.320
must be driven out of Lucca.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.760
Signor Guadagni, call the question.

48:12.840 --> 48:15.560
- Hear, hear.

48:25.440 --> 48:27.480
Exception!

48:27.560 --> 48:32.480
Signor Albizzi.
Will you yield to Messer Medici?

48:59.240 --> 49:01.720
The Albizzi and the other
noble families of Florence

49:01.800 --> 49:04.360
have provided for this city for centuries.

49:05.520 --> 49:08.600
And war has been
the instrument of their power,

49:08.680 --> 49:10.880
and they prosecute them endlessly.

49:12.320 --> 49:17.320
-Your point, Messer Medici?
-We're in the new age.

49:17.400 --> 49:20.440
With a new generation of men,
who understand a simple truth:

49:20.520 --> 49:22.760
that war is wrong.

49:28.680 --> 49:32.200
-Is it all there?
-Of course.

49:32.280 --> 49:34.280
Then this will do. For now.

49:36.760 --> 49:40.880
These lofty paintings glorify war,
but omit its stench.

49:42.160 --> 49:47.640
A new world is here.
A world of business and trade.

49:47.720 --> 49:52.440
A world where men are awarded
for their ideas and initiative,

49:52.520 --> 49:54.760
a world where if you are born poor,

49:54.840 --> 49:57.720
it no longer means your children
must remain poor!

49:57.800 --> 50:02.040
Your business is nothing but usury.

50:02.120 --> 50:05.280
Which Holy Mother Church condemns.

50:07.560 --> 50:12.120
Jews, not gentlemen, are usurers.

50:12.200 --> 50:15.880
Gentlemen don't hold pens,
we wield swords!

50:17.400 --> 50:21.360
And swords grow rusty
if they are not used.

50:21.440 --> 50:24.920
- I call a vote!

50:25.000 --> 50:27.400
No, no!

50:27.480 --> 50:32.160
--Order! Order!

50:45.080 --> 50:46.400
What is that?

50:48.760 --> 50:50.600
Albizzi carried the vote.

50:58.200 --> 51:00.320
So there will be war.

51:01.720 --> 51:04.720
With guns in Lucca,
and without them in Florence.

51:04.800 --> 51:09.560
-What of the surgeon, Di Cecco?
-He's dead.

51:12.680 --> 51:13.680
How?

51:14.960 --> 51:18.680
He was going to shout out.
I had no choice.

51:23.160 --> 51:24.760
There is always a choice.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.400
I made mine years ago.
