00:26.818 --> 00:30.739
There are lots of promising leads
for life in our solar system,

00:30.822 --> 00:33.242
but so far, nothing definite.

00:33.325 --> 00:37.913
That's why NASA and its international
partners run overlapping missions.

00:37.996 --> 00:41.208
So they can follow
as many different leads as possible.

00:41.291 --> 00:46.588
So maybe we need to think even bigger
and look outside the solar system.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.966
I thought you'd never ask, Charles.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.845
As this map shows,
the galaxy is pretty big.

01:08.235 --> 01:12.739
Our solar system is right about there.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.493
By that speck of dust?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.162
It is that speck of dust.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.254
Where are all these planets hiding?

01:27.337 --> 01:31.550
When you look at the night sky,
all you see is space and stars.

01:31.633 --> 01:36.096
True, but each of those stars is
a sun that might have its own planets.

01:36.763 --> 01:37.973
<i>Exactly!</i>

01:40.559 --> 01:42.102
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

01:42.186 --> 01:45.022
<i>I've been working
on my dramatic entrances.</i>

01:45.856 --> 01:46.982
<i>But Marcie is right.</i>

01:47.065 --> 01:48.817
<i>Every star is a sun,</i>

01:48.901 --> 01:53.030
<i>and the planets orbiting
those distant suns are called exoplanets,</i>

01:53.113 --> 01:55.574
<i>or planets outside of our solar system.</i>

01:56.158 --> 01:58.660
<i>NASA has been looking for them for years.</i>

01:58.744 --> 02:02.581
<i>The search for exoplanets is
one of NASA's most exciting projects.</i>
<i>The search for exoplanets is
one of NASA's most exciting projects.</i>

02:03.165 --> 02:05.459
<i>One way we look for them is
to study distant stars</i>

02:05.542 --> 02:08.628
<i>to see if there's a little dip
in their brightness.</i>

02:08.961 --> 02:13.592
<i>That dip could indicate
a planet passing by as it orbits the star.</i>

02:13.675 --> 02:17.763
<i>We can follow up with other telescopes
that look for a little wobble in the light</i>

02:17.846 --> 02:20.224
<i>that could also be caused by a planet.</i>

02:20.307 --> 02:21.725
<i>When we do find a planet,</i>

02:21.808 --> 02:28.732
<i>we use very powerful space telescopes,
like Hubble or the James Webb Telescope,</i>

02:28.815 --> 02:30.901
<i>to examine the planet more closely,</i>

02:30.984 --> 02:33.654
<i>to see if it might be able
to support life.</i>

02:35.614 --> 02:38.659
<i>We've already recorded
quite a few exoplanets.</i>

02:38.742 --> 02:39.743
<i>Have a look.</i>

02:46.542 --> 02:48.418
Wow!

02:52.923 --> 02:57.177
Here's a planet that orbits the star
once every 18 hours.

02:57.261 --> 03:00.806
That means a year is only 18 hours long!
That means a year is only 18 hours long!

03:00.889 --> 03:03.225
It would be your birthday every day.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.980
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

03:14.069 --> 03:16.029
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

03:18.574 --> 03:20.742
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

03:21.785 --> 03:23.495
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

03:28.041 --> 03:31.753
<i>Unfortunately, Sally,
that planet is incredibly hot,</i>

03:31.837 --> 03:34.089
<i>and the surface is made out of gas.</i>

03:34.173 --> 03:36.550
<i>Not the best spot for a birthday party.</i>

03:36.633 --> 03:40.679
Oh, well, I'd probably get a stomachache
from all that cake anyway.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.891
Here's an exoplanet that has two suns.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.186
Imagine how fast my garden would grow.

03:54.484 --> 03:58.405
Nothing beats a double sunny day
and some hard work in the garden.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.912
I'm tired just thinking about it.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.206
<i>Don't let the two suns fool you, Lucy.</i>

04:07.289 --> 04:11.668
<i>The average temperature on that planet is
much too cold to grow your garden.</i>

04:11.752 --> 04:14.213
<i>Also, minor point, it has no soil.</i>

04:16.507 --> 04:20.302
These exoplanets don't seem
very promising so far.

04:20.385 --> 04:25.474
That's only two. It says here
NASA has discovered over 4,000.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.893
4,000?

04:31.146 --> 04:35.859
<i>And that's just the ones we know about.
The actual number is probably closer to--</i>

04:35.943 --> 04:37.277
A jagillion?

04:38.195 --> 04:39.988
That's not a real number.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.865
More like a hundred billion.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.452
And that's just in the Milky Way.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.914
Which is one of billions
and billions of galaxies!

04:54.461 --> 04:56.421
Billions and billions?

04:56.505 --> 04:59.341
Just when you think
you understand the universe.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.432
<i>Those are the controls
for a high-powered telescope.</i>

05:07.516 --> 05:09.142
Charlie Brown!

05:10.310 --> 05:12.312
I hope I didn't break it.

05:12.396 --> 05:16.108
I don't think my allowance can cover
the cost of a NASA telescope.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.321
<i>Hang on.</i>

05:23.699 --> 05:25.492
<i>Interesting.</i>

05:29.955 --> 05:31.957
I may be wrong,

05:32.040 --> 05:35.544
but it looks like the light
from that star is dipping a bit.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.045
<i>Checking coordinates.</i>

05:37.129 --> 05:39.047
<i>Beep-bop, boop-boop-boop, beep-bop-boop.</i>

05:39.798 --> 05:41.592
<i>Outstanding.</i>

05:41.675 --> 05:42.885
<i>Charlie Brown,</i>

05:42.968 --> 05:47.598
<i>I think you may have just discovered
a brand-new exoplanet.</i>

05:48.473 --> 05:50.100
<i>Congratulations.</i>

05:51.268 --> 05:53.228
My very own exoplanet?

05:53.729 --> 05:55.564
- Way to go, Charlie Brown!
- Nice work.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.940
Awesome! Yeah!

05:57.024 --> 05:58.025
It's about time.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.360
Charlie Brown does it again.
Charlie Brown does it again.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.198
It looks like it's almost
the same size as Earth

06:04.281 --> 06:08.410
and about the same distance from its star
as Earth's distance from the sun.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.997
That means it could be
a perfect planet for life to exist.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.291
A perfect planet?

06:19.796 --> 06:23.383
Are all those valentines for you,
big brother?

06:23.467 --> 06:27.179
There's even one
from The Little Red-Haired Girl.

06:27.471 --> 06:32.893
Before we start, I just want to say
how much I appreciate you, Charlie Brown.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.311
No charge today.

06:37.814 --> 06:41.652
Say what you will about Charlie Brown,
he knows how to fly a kite.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.657
Strike three! You're out!

06:46.740 --> 06:50.786
Wow, you pitched a perfect game,
Charlie Brown.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.246
We won!

06:52.329 --> 06:54.748
Charlie Brown. Charlie Brown.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.167
Charlie Brown!

07:00.420 --> 07:04.383
I mean, wow, an exoplanet.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.093
How soon can we get there?

07:06.176 --> 07:09.513
<i>Get there?
It would take hundreds of years.</i>

07:09.596 --> 07:11.306
<i>Entire generations.</i>

07:11.807 --> 07:15.102
<i>It's a terrific discovery, Charlie Brown,</i>

07:15.185 --> 07:19.022
<i>but going there is pretty much impossible
with today's technology.</i>

07:19.106 --> 07:20.107
Rats.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.586
Hey!

07:41.587 --> 07:44.089
Has anyone seen my map of the galaxy?

07:44.715 --> 07:46.925
How do you lose a whole galaxy?
