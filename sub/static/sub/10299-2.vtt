01:21.100 --> 01:23.333
So are you really sick?

01:23.367 --> 01:26.800
You're not just trying to get
out of going to see my mother?

01:28.367 --> 01:30.567
Now, Peg, that hurts.

01:31.868 --> 01:35.368
You know how much I love
that huge, fat woman.

01:37.300 --> 01:39.533
Yeah, we're
really sick, Mom.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.401
I think we have
Monte Cristo's revenge.

01:43.133 --> 01:45.001
Well...

01:46.033 --> 01:48.133
Mom is gonna be
really disappointed.

01:48.167 --> 01:50.133
You know, ever since her dog,
Rusty, died,

01:50.167 --> 01:52.266
the only comfort she has

01:52.300 --> 01:55.233
is patting your head
till she falls asleep.

01:55.267 --> 01:57.166
I am not
a Labrador retriever.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.166
And I never bought the fact
that a full-grown dog

02:00.200 --> 02:02.166
could accidentally wrap itself
in bacon

02:02.200 --> 02:05.099
and fall
in a microwave oven.

02:05.133 --> 02:07.966
Well, what other explanation
could there have been?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.500
Well, maybe he could
have told us

02:09.533 --> 02:13.767
if his mouth hadn't been
accidentally toothpicked shut.

02:15.567 --> 02:17.567
You know, I don't know.

02:17.601 --> 02:19.233
They find one flea collar
in your bed,

02:19.267 --> 02:21.900
and you're branded
for life as a dog-eater.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.133
Oh, well.

02:23.167 --> 02:25.567
Gee, I wonder
what's taking Bud so long.

02:25.601 --> 02:27.333
You know, I sent him
to the magazine stand

02:27.367 --> 02:30.467
to get Mom some of those
"larger women" romance novels.

02:30.501 --> 02:33.234
<i>She wanted
The Pie Man Always Rings Twice.</i>

02:36.968 --> 02:38.099
Well...

02:38.133 --> 02:39.900
they were all out
of thePie Mansaga.

02:39.934 --> 02:41.800
So I got her another
old favorite:

02:41.834 --> 02:45.134
<i>The Red Fudge
of Courage.</i>

02:46.934 --> 02:48.500
Wait a second.

02:48.534 --> 02:49.667
What's with them?

02:49.701 --> 02:51.767
We're sick,
so we're not going.

02:51.801 --> 02:53.266
Hah!

02:53.300 --> 02:54.800
I mean...

02:56.934 --> 02:58.900
So that's it.

02:58.934 --> 03:01.733
Mom, I'm telling you,
they're not sick.

03:01.767 --> 03:03.300
I saw them whispering
and plotting

03:03.334 --> 03:06.500
in clipped
and hushed tones.
Hm.

03:06.534 --> 03:10.001
They don't love Grandma
as much as I do.

03:10.334 --> 03:12.600
Why was I
not included?

03:13.601 --> 03:14.567
Come on, Bud.

03:14.601 --> 03:15.667
Let's go.

03:15.701 --> 03:17.166
You gonna miss me,
honey?

03:17.200 --> 03:20.001
Well, I can't
until you leave.

03:24.801 --> 03:26.966
Well, you know,
I left you plenty of food.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.767
It's at the supermarket.

03:30.834 --> 03:33.401
Have a good time,
Junior Mint.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.600
Damn you.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.001
Damn you both.

03:38.601 --> 03:40.368
Damn your eyes.

03:41.033 --> 03:42.533
Come on, Bud!

03:42.567 --> 03:45.468
Grandma needs
a sitz bath!

03:49.567 --> 03:52.400
If it takes me a thousand years
and a thousand lives,

03:52.434 --> 03:54.500
I'll make you pay
for this.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.167
This I vow.

03:58.901 --> 04:00.633
Have a good time
at Grandma's.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.734
Yeah, tell her we said moo.

04:08.968 --> 04:10.533
They're gone!

04:17.834 --> 04:19.166
Now, Kelly,

04:19.200 --> 04:21.366
we're gonna be spending
a whole week together.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.600
And you might hear a "yippee"
or a "yeow" from me.

04:24.634 --> 04:27.099
That doesn't mean
I don't miss your mama.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.900
Just like changing
of the locks don't mean

04:28.934 --> 04:31.200
I don't want her back.

04:31.234 --> 04:35.066
Just adults, uh, express
their sadness in different ways.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.533
And I express mine
by doing the Bump.

04:40.801 --> 04:42.900
Ah, life is good.

04:44.234 --> 04:45.200
To me.

04:45.234 --> 04:47.468
To us.

04:51.501 --> 04:52.633
I meant...

04:52.667 --> 04:57.734
Two beers for you
and none for me.

05:05.801 --> 05:08.033
Daddy, you know, we're gonna
have a week to ourselves,

05:08.067 --> 05:09.733
and I thought
that it would be a good idea

05:09.767 --> 05:11.066
if we did something together.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.333
You know,
we never have.

05:12.367 --> 05:13.999
Well, sure we did.

05:14.033 --> 05:17.767
Well, the day you were born,
I carried you from the hospital.

05:17.801 --> 05:20.500
And, uh, 10 years later,
we had ice cream,

05:20.534 --> 05:23.800
and, uh, now, here we are.

05:23.834 --> 05:27.033
Okay, well, how about
if we just talk?

05:27.067 --> 05:28.366
Great.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.099
So, uh...

05:30.133 --> 05:31.099
How's school?

05:31.133 --> 05:32.333
I'm out of school,
Daddy.

05:32.367 --> 05:35.066
Good. Good. Um...

05:35.100 --> 05:37.867
So, uh...

05:37.901 --> 05:39.700
How old are you?

05:42.634 --> 05:43.733
Well...

05:43.767 --> 05:45.433
Going by the number
of birthday parties

05:45.467 --> 05:48.633
that you've thrown
for me, I'm...3.

05:49.868 --> 05:52.101
God, how the years go by.

05:53.167 --> 05:54.700
You don't know much
about me, do you?

05:54.734 --> 05:56.467
I do know I carried you
from the hospital

05:56.501 --> 05:57.633
the day you were born.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.433
I remember 'cause
I accidentally left you

05:59.467 --> 06:01.401
on the top of the car.

06:03.067 --> 06:04.667
I was about to drive away

06:04.701 --> 06:06.667
when I heard this sad,
little voice say,

06:06.701 --> 06:08.966
"Stop. You're forgetting me."

06:09.000 --> 06:10.333
So I got out,
let your mother in,

06:10.367 --> 06:13.234
and there you were.

06:15.601 --> 06:18.300
Oh, Daddy, I've never felt
so close to you.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.800
So this week,
let's make sure

06:19.834 --> 06:21.467
that we never see
each other, okay?

06:21.501 --> 06:23.366
That would bring us
even closer together.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.767
Okay. Aw.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.633
All right, I'll see you
next week. Bye, Dad.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.468
Whatever.

06:34.434 --> 06:36.066
At last.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.600
Single with TV.

06:37.634 --> 06:39.567
Ah.

06:39.601 --> 06:42.667
<i>Pa? Pa, can I really
keep the pig</i>

06:42.701 --> 06:43.900
<i>I raised as a pet?</i>

06:43.934 --> 06:45.500
<i>Sure, you can, son.</i>

06:45.534 --> 06:48.967
<i>Now, uh, run along
and do your chores.</i>

06:53.033 --> 06:56.334
<i>The boy sure is dumb.</i>

06:57.634 --> 07:00.800
<i>* Who's that ridin'
Into the sun? *</i>

07:00.834 --> 07:04.033
<i>* Who's the man
With the itchy gun? *</i>

07:04.067 --> 07:07.133
<i>* Who's the man
Who kills for fun? *</i>

07:07.167 --> 07:08.966
<i>* Psycho Dad *</i>

07:09.000 --> 07:11.467
<i>* Psycho Dad *</i>

07:11.501 --> 07:12.934
<i>* Psycho Dad *</i>

07:12.968 --> 07:14.966
<i>* He's quick with a gun *</i>

07:15.000 --> 07:17.834
<i>* But he loves his son *</i>

07:17.868 --> 07:20.999
<i>* Killed his wife
'Cause she weighed a ton *</i>

07:21.033 --> 07:23.667
<i>* Psycho Dad! *</i>

07:29.334 --> 07:30.867
* Psycho Dad *

07:30.901 --> 07:32.733
* Psycho Dad *

07:32.767 --> 07:36.067
* Psycho Dad *

07:42.467 --> 07:44.467
Sorry, Peg,

07:44.501 --> 07:46.033
but I'm gonna have
to leave you there

07:46.067 --> 07:49.101
as a lesson to other women
who don't cook for me.

07:52.234 --> 07:53.433
Yeah.

07:53.467 --> 07:55.067
Ah...

07:59.834 --> 08:02.533
Hey.

08:05.868 --> 08:07.500
Yeah.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.733
Al.

08:21.767 --> 08:24.201
Al.

08:26.667 --> 08:29.133
Leave me alone, Peg.

08:29.167 --> 08:30.200
Al,

08:30.234 --> 08:32.567
let's fool around.

08:32.601 --> 08:36.265
Go away.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.033
Please?

08:38.067 --> 08:39.600
You know,
pleading got you married,

08:39.634 --> 08:41.933
but it's not gonna get you--

08:48.367 --> 08:49.633
Well...

08:49.667 --> 08:51.667
Hello.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.400
Are you gonna make me beg?

08:56.434 --> 08:57.633
Oh, you will do things,

08:57.667 --> 09:01.166
but begging will not be one
of them.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.667
<i>Daddy!</i>

09:07.100 --> 09:08.066
Daddy?

09:08.100 --> 09:11.200
Mm. Hm-mm.

09:11.234 --> 09:14.234
Daddy?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.834
It's not what you think.

09:19.868 --> 09:22.333
It couldn't be.

09:22.367 --> 09:24.266
By the way, what the hell
are you doing here?

09:24.300 --> 09:26.967
I'm sick.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.533
<i>I wonder</i>

09:29.567 --> 09:33.734
<i>what Psycho Dad would do
in a case like this.</i>

09:35.133 --> 09:38.301
There, there, pumpkin.
There, there.

09:46.267 --> 09:48.301
Ugh.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.934
God, what a day
in the shoe store.

09:55.234 --> 09:56.767
We had a clearance sale.

09:56.801 --> 10:01.133
We had to get rid
of all our size 13DDDD's.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.500
Store was packed with women.

10:03.534 --> 10:05.567
Well, there were actually
only two in the store,

10:05.601 --> 10:08.368
but it was wall-to-wall.

10:09.033 --> 10:10.166
You know, you'd think--

10:10.200 --> 10:11.934
You'd think that women
with big, fat feet

10:11.968 --> 10:13.300
would be slim and beautiful,

10:13.334 --> 10:16.468
but surprisingly...

10:16.934 --> 10:18.400
Daddy, I'm sick.

10:18.434 --> 10:20.033
Will you make me
some toast?

10:20.067 --> 10:22.333
Well, Kelly,
you were here all day.

10:22.367 --> 10:24.633
Couldn't you make
some yourself?

10:24.667 --> 10:26.066
No.

10:26.100 --> 10:29.366
Heh, you are your mother's
daughter, aren't you?

10:29.400 --> 10:31.800
Would you mind telling me
why you couldn't make some?

10:31.834 --> 10:34.133
Isn't it obvious?

10:34.167 --> 10:35.667
Because I am sick,

10:35.701 --> 10:38.533
and if I touched the bread,
then I would get my germs on it,

10:38.567 --> 10:41.734
and then I would be eating
my own germs.

10:45.534 --> 10:48.434
Oh, and another reason is
we don't have any bread.

10:49.634 --> 10:51.033
Well, if we don't have
any bread,

10:51.067 --> 10:53.067
how can you expect me
to make toast?

10:54.100 --> 10:56.266
Aw, no.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.767
Why didn't you call me
at the store,

10:57.801 --> 10:59.567
so I could have picked
some bread up?

10:59.601 --> 11:02.067
Isn't it obvious?

11:03.067 --> 11:05.834
Because if I used the phone,
then I'd be getting germs on it,

11:05.868 --> 11:08.700
and then I would be talking
to my own germs.

11:11.434 --> 11:13.467
Come on, get me
some bread, Daddy.

11:13.501 --> 11:16.368
Wait, I'm just waiting
to hear something.

11:21.334 --> 11:23.633
Now, I can go.

11:34.133 --> 11:35.366
Are you okay, Daddy?

11:35.400 --> 11:36.900
Oh, great.

11:36.934 --> 11:38.500
Lucky for me,
the hailstones stopped

11:38.534 --> 11:41.368
just as I pulled
into the garage.

11:42.868 --> 11:43.834
What are you doing?

11:43.868 --> 11:45.133
Eatin' pizza.

11:45.167 --> 11:46.366
Some for me?

11:46.400 --> 11:49.166
Oh, no, it's all gone, Daddy.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.433
Too bad, 'cause it was
a real good one too.

11:52.467 --> 11:53.966
Who the hell is this?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.700
I'm Artie
from Pizza by Jake.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.400
You owe me 7.50,
plus a tip.

12:02.434 --> 12:04.301
I'll give you a tip.

12:12.968 --> 12:15.434
Doors are hard.

12:16.834 --> 12:18.900
Keep the change.

12:25.601 --> 12:27.066
Pumpkin,
let me ask you something.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.966
If you couldn't call me
at work for bread,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.166
when did you decide
you could call for pizza?

12:31.200 --> 12:34.733
Well, I was thinking,
and I remembered that old rhyme:

12:34.767 --> 12:38.467
Feet are cold,
starve for pizza.

12:38.501 --> 12:39.767
No, wait, or is it:

12:39.801 --> 12:44.266
Starve a pizza,
eat cold feet.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.433
Well, at least we know

12:45.467 --> 12:47.734
your fever's shot
right past your IQ.

12:48.501 --> 12:49.667
Now,

12:49.701 --> 12:52.067
I guess we can--

12:54.901 --> 12:56.967
We can use that bread
a little later.

12:58.300 --> 13:00.066
So, what do you wanna do, Dad?

13:00.100 --> 13:03.567
Well, we could lower our heads
and run into each other.

13:04.234 --> 13:06.333
Daddy, you're so funny.
I love you.

13:06.367 --> 13:07.533
Do you love me?

13:07.567 --> 13:09.333
Well, love, hate--
Look, we're a family.

13:09.367 --> 13:11.266
What's the difference?

13:11.300 --> 13:13.433
Now, Kelly, go be sick
in your room.

13:13.467 --> 13:15.366
Daddy wants to watch
tube-top wrestling.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.467
No, but you can't,
Daddy.

13:17.501 --> 13:20.266
Because tonight is the big
music video countdown.

13:20.300 --> 13:24.400
It's the top 10,000
classic videos of 1989.

13:24.434 --> 13:26.200
Oh, come on.
Watch with me, Daddy.

13:26.234 --> 13:27.900
Maybe you'll see
one of your favorites.

13:27.934 --> 13:29.966
Uh, well, I-- I really like
the oldies. Youknow:

13:30.000 --> 13:34.934
<i>See me, touch me, feel me
Marry me, kill me</i>

13:36.667 --> 13:38.066
Good night, pumpkin.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.333
Oh, one more thing, Daddy.

13:39.367 --> 13:41.366
Wh-- ? Why, did you hear
a tornado's coming?

13:41.400 --> 13:43.200
You want me to go out
for pantyhose?

13:43.234 --> 13:45.733
Daddy, you know
I haven't worn pantyhose

13:45.767 --> 13:48.433
since I was 7.

13:48.467 --> 13:51.667
Anyway, while the pizza boy
was going through the drawers,

13:52.067 --> 13:54.133
he found this.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.500
What's that?

13:55.534 --> 13:58.166
It's a bell.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.366
Remember?

13:59.400 --> 14:01.366
Mom got it last April Fools'?

14:01.400 --> 14:02.500
She'd ring it,

14:02.534 --> 14:03.966
and you'd think
dinner was ready,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.600
so you'd come
running down the stairs

14:05.634 --> 14:06.867
with a big smile
on your face.

14:06.901 --> 14:08.567
And then when there'd be
nothing to eat,

14:08.601 --> 14:10.066
we'd all be laughing
and pointing.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.633
And then-- Then you'd go on
upstairs all sad and hungry.

14:16.868 --> 14:17.834
Please stop, Daddy.

14:17.868 --> 14:20.266
If I laugh,
I'm gonna cough.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.800
But I was starving.

14:24.367 --> 14:25.867
"I was starv-- "

14:28.334 --> 14:30.633
Oh, God,
you crack me up.

14:30.667 --> 14:33.166
Anyway, I just thought
that it would be a good idea

14:33.200 --> 14:34.800
to call you
when I need something.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.366
But don't worry,
I'm not gonna use it

14:36.400 --> 14:39.567
unless it is really,
truly necessary, okay?

14:45.834 --> 14:48.334
What? What?

14:48.901 --> 14:50.233
Oh, hi, Daddy.

14:50.267 --> 14:52.633
Oh, I was just playing along
with the video.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.733
And for the lack
of one condom,

14:55.767 --> 14:58.167
an entire life was ruined.

15:06.801 --> 15:09.334
Honey, I'm home.

15:12.767 --> 15:14.667
How was your day?

15:14.701 --> 15:18.099
Well, a wealthy executive's
life is a busy one,

15:18.133 --> 15:20.401
but why should I
bore you with that?

15:20.868 --> 15:23.468
Here's my paycheck.

15:24.767 --> 15:26.867
So, what did
you do today, dear?

15:26.901 --> 15:29.500
Well, I watched TV

15:29.534 --> 15:32.266
and drank beer.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.400
You're so clever.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.733
I do what I can.

15:35.767 --> 15:38.900
Well, do what you can with me.

15:45.300 --> 15:47.468
<i>Daddy!</i>

15:47.701 --> 15:51.067
Daddy-y!

15:57.400 --> 15:59.999
Daddy!

16:00.033 --> 16:01.333
What is it?

16:01.367 --> 16:03.600
What is it?

16:04.200 --> 16:06.600
I can't sleep.

16:07.501 --> 16:09.266
Well, have you tried
counting something?

16:09.300 --> 16:12.867
Like the seconds
you have left to live?

16:12.901 --> 16:16.734
I want you to tell me
a bedtime story.

16:17.834 --> 16:21.034
You know, like you never did
when I was a child.

16:21.734 --> 16:22.800
Please?

16:22.834 --> 16:24.734
That's not going to work.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.200
Please?

16:26.234 --> 16:28.368
Okay.

16:34.934 --> 16:37.533
It's not a happy story.

16:38.334 --> 16:41.999
It's a story
of great sadness and woe.

16:42.033 --> 16:45.266
Once upon a time...

16:45.300 --> 16:49.500
there was a man
who sold shoes.

16:49.534 --> 16:50.500
He was a good man,

16:50.534 --> 16:52.200
but, somehow,

16:52.234 --> 16:56.099
good things never came
to him.

16:56.133 --> 16:59.733
Did I mention he was
a great athlete in high school?

16:59.767 --> 17:01.834
People cheered him.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.733
That was before the...

17:04.767 --> 17:07.434
red thing appeared.

17:09.567 --> 17:13.165
Darkness fell
on Shoetown.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.800
Who would take on
the red beast?

17:15.834 --> 17:17.999
Who would battle?

17:18.032 --> 17:20.767
Who would marry it?

17:21.601 --> 17:25.366
The little shoe man
stepped forward.

17:25.400 --> 17:29.967
Or perhaps the others
just stepped back...

17:30.200 --> 17:31.867
At any rate,

17:31.901 --> 17:35.767
an unholy union was born.

17:35.801 --> 17:39.333
So were two unholy children.

17:39.367 --> 17:41.366
And the lowly shoe man,

17:41.400 --> 17:43.467
who once had been a mighty
athlete in high school

17:43.501 --> 17:45.266
and scored four touchdowns
in one game

17:45.300 --> 17:47.033
and had many offers
to junior colleges

17:47.067 --> 17:50.134
and could have made something
of his life...

17:54.133 --> 17:55.934
laid down...

17:55.968 --> 17:58.301
and died.

17:59.834 --> 18:01.900
The end.

18:08.634 --> 18:11.267
Al.

18:13.300 --> 18:17.267
As in,
Alnight long?

18:19.934 --> 18:22.900
As in, AlI want.

18:22.934 --> 18:27.900
Well, then,
Alyou shall have.

18:28.868 --> 18:32.134
Honey, I'm home!

18:33.200 --> 18:36.967
Al Hercules Bundy!

18:37.267 --> 18:38.567
Who is this person?

18:38.601 --> 18:41.167
Who's this, Alzy?

18:41.667 --> 18:42.767
Well?

18:42.801 --> 18:45.800
Well?

18:45.834 --> 18:50.001
Well, obviously,
I'm having a hell of a dream.

18:51.968 --> 18:53.099
Rather--

18:53.133 --> 18:54.867
Rather than take time
and explain it all,

18:54.901 --> 18:58.567
why don't you two just fight
over me right here on the bed

18:58.601 --> 19:01.267
while I watch
and take pictures.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.366
And the winner

19:05.400 --> 19:08.301
gets to have me first.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.133
And third,

19:10.167 --> 19:12.567
and fifth.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.301
You may begin.

19:21.701 --> 19:23.201
Girls.

19:23.934 --> 19:26.368
There's not enough hair
whipping around.

19:38.734 --> 19:41.233
Al, this is really no fun
unless you...

19:41.267 --> 19:43.266
join us.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.667
Yes, please join us.

19:46.701 --> 19:48.999
Well...

19:49.033 --> 19:50.867
Okay.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.401
Here comes Daddy.

20:15.701 --> 20:16.900
Oh, I just wanted you
to see

20:16.934 --> 20:20.667
how cute Buck looked
with the bell.

20:36.534 --> 20:38.434
Oh, Daddy,
one more thing.

20:40.133 --> 20:43.734
What do you want?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.800
I want--

20:47.834 --> 20:50.067
I want--

20:53.868 --> 20:55.633
I wanna say good night.

21:03.167 --> 21:05.966
God, I feel great.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.900
I am so glad
I'm over with that cold.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.533
It was death.

21:09.567 --> 21:11.767
So how are you today,
Daddy?

21:11.801 --> 21:12.900
Mm.

21:12.934 --> 21:17.500
I'm better.
My fever is down to 120 now.

21:17.534 --> 21:19.133
Well, I just wanted
to thank you

21:19.167 --> 21:20.633
for taking care
of me all week.

21:20.667 --> 21:22.433
That was very sweet
of you, Daddy.

21:22.467 --> 21:24.099
And if there is anything
that you want,

21:24.133 --> 21:25.900
you just ask.

21:25.934 --> 21:27.266
Well, thank you,
honey.

21:27.300 --> 21:30.067
I could use maybe
a little crust of--

21:30.567 --> 21:33.034
Oops. I gotta go.
Goodbye.

21:33.434 --> 21:35.101
Fine. Go.

21:38.834 --> 21:42.201
No eat, no drink,
no money have I none.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.433
Well, at least
there's one thing

21:46.467 --> 21:49.067
they can't take away
from me.

21:53.701 --> 21:55.867
<i>Al.</i>

21:55.901 --> 21:59.267
Al.

22:00.634 --> 22:02.767
Coming.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.667
It's enema time!

22:13.968 --> 22:17.001
Someone ring the bell.

22:19.501 --> 22:22.500
Oh, God!
I can't wake up!

22:24.701 --> 22:27.867
Help me!
