00:15.149 --> 00:16.917
Previously on
Blunt Talk...

00:17.017 --> 00:18.052
Leave me alone
or I'll jump.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.553
Just tell me
who sent you and why.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.189
I work for a private dick
name Arbogast.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.557
He tells me where to go
and what to do, but not
what for.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.293
This is Dr. Rudy Kamper.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.028
Off the record,
what's your stance
on anal sex?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.630
What is the latest
with Jimelia?

00:29.730 --> 00:31.332
They're not speaking.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.767
Jim was mistaken
for a prostitute
and had a brief affair.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.937
I'm going
to ask Rosalie Number 2
if we can be open.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.407
She's not a normal girl.
She might go for it.

00:39.507 --> 00:42.210
That's good.
Honesty is always the best.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.380
Sorry, everyone.
Gosh, I guess it was loaded.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.217
The logbook, sir.
Why would she take it?

00:49.317 --> 00:50.684
They must want
something on me.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.521
What in the logbook
is incriminating
or humiliating?

00:53.621 --> 00:54.722
Everything, sir.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.490
Fuck.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.975
Say these words
after me.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.978
I despair of my sins.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.348
I despair of my sins.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.253
O God of all goodness...

01:25.353 --> 01:28.722
O God...
...how could I ever
have offended Thee?

01:28.822 --> 01:30.524
...of all goodness.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.539
Mom, please.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.608
I'm thirsty.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.211
Is this what you want
for your children?

01:50.311 --> 01:52.413
Water from
your neighbor's toilet?

01:52.513 --> 01:53.447
Yuck.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.349
Vote against Proposition 68.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.685
Paid for by People
for Clean Water.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.720
All right.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.022
Are you ready
for round 2.5, babe?

02:02.190 --> 02:04.325
Okay.

02:04.425 --> 02:07.361
Do you always wear
a towel around your head
after a shower?

02:07.461 --> 02:09.430
Of course.
All men do. Why?

02:09.530 --> 02:10.898
Nothing.

02:10.998 --> 02:14.702
Hey, did you ask that because
you think I shower too much?

02:14.802 --> 02:18.606
I don't think I do.
I-- I don't know,
maybe I do.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.108
Dr. Rudy, I--
I'm gonna be frank
with you.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.344
You should know who I am
right from the start.

02:23.444 --> 02:26.247
I need to keep
my anus very clean.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.316
It's a neurosis
brought on by my job.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.651
But please don't judge me.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.422
I'm just really,
really into you.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.590
Oh, thank you.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.795
Celia, where are you?

02:41.895 --> 02:43.697
I've been texting
all night.

02:43.797 --> 02:47.235
I don't-- I don't like
you being alone with a gun

02:47.268 --> 02:49.870
and not knowing
how to use it.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.073
Or maybe there's
an ammonia gas leak.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.576
Lots of people
die like that

02:55.676 --> 02:58.078
and never realize it.

02:58.246 --> 03:01.349
Anyway, it's like
you're sending me

03:01.449 --> 03:04.618
telepathic cries for help.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.687
So I'm gonna come over.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.423
'Cause I'm worried.

03:09.523 --> 03:13.594
And I know you're upset
about Evelyn,

03:13.694 --> 03:17.298
but I-- I can't stop
loving you.

03:23.471 --> 03:28.342
Oh, this feels
so good, Harry.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.779
Oh, I just remembered.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.349
I had another disturbing
Orson Welles dream.

03:35.449 --> 03:38.352
Oh, I liked it better, sir,
when your subconscious

03:38.452 --> 03:40.554
played
Burt Lancaster films.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.955
I agree.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.758
In this dream,
Orson was young

03:44.858 --> 03:47.861
and he was a murderer.

03:47.961 --> 03:51.299
Maybe--
maybe I'm feeling anxious

03:51.332 --> 03:54.402
about going to see
this private detective, Harry.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.538
There's also Vivian
and Moby's rehearsal
dinner tonight, sir.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.172
Perhaps that's
troubling you.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.809
Oh, shit, I forgot.
Why didn't you remind me?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.176
I just did, sir.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.879
Hello. Hello?

04:05.979 --> 04:08.882
Rafe?
Rafe, my boy!

04:08.982 --> 04:10.384
What the hell is this?

04:10.484 --> 04:13.687
I'm giving your father
a witch hazel treatment.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.189
It's good for circulation
and joie de vivre.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.426
And it works.
Oh.

04:18.526 --> 04:21.161
It's good to see you, son.
But what are you doing here?

04:21.329 --> 04:23.331
You got a fight?
Why didn't you call?

04:23.364 --> 04:26.166
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm down for Vivian's wedding.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.201
I figured you knew
I was coming.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.971
Oh, nobody tells me
anything around here.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.940
Vivian invited you?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.608
Yeah, of course she did.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.977
Of all my stepmoms,
she's my favorite.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.347
Right.
More witch hazel, sir?

04:39.380 --> 04:40.681
Or shall we get
you dressed?

04:40.781 --> 04:43.250
It's 8:00 A.M.
and Arbogast opens at 9:00.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.419
Oh, let's get dressed, Harry.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.688
What's an Arbogast?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.458
A private dick
who's trying to sully
your father's reputation

04:50.558 --> 04:52.893
on behalf of a treacherous
water conglomerate.

04:52.993 --> 04:57.197
That is
an excellent definition
of an Arbogast, Harry.

04:57.365 --> 05:00.368
Now, we have
your mid-'80s
Dan Rather look

05:00.468 --> 05:02.603
or your late-'70s
Serge Gainsbourg.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.472
Oh, Gainsbourg,
definitely, Harry.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.707
Bien sÃ»r, Major.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.643
Please let me come in?
Please.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.380
Why? If you want
to be with other women,

05:12.446 --> 05:14.382
that means that you
don't want to be with me.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.617
We've been over this.
I do want to be with you.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.387
I just don't know
if I'm capable of monogamy.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.989
Nobody is,
but you have to try.

05:22.089 --> 05:25.793
I have tried,
but maybe I'm too much
like a bumblebee

05:25.893 --> 05:29.062
and I just need
to dip my stinger in all
the beautiful flowers.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.032
Oh, God.
You make me want
to hurt myself.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.802
Huh?
There's a lot
of Motrin in here

05:34.902 --> 05:36.269
and a rusty lady's Bic.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.305
What?
No, no, don't hurt
yourself, please.

05:38.406 --> 05:40.874
I-I'm sorry I said anything.
I'm sorry I hurt you.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.711
I'm an idiot and should
be shot immediately.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.315
I've come to
an executive decision.

05:48.416 --> 05:51.419
If you want to be with
other women, then I need
to be involved.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.986
I don't want
to lose you.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.157
Involved?

05:57.257 --> 06:00.060
It's good to see
the top of your head, son.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.662
Thank you, Walter.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.331
Yeah, I can
hardly believe it,
but I've missed you.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.534
How are your relations
with those fight fixers?

06:06.634 --> 06:07.668
Have you worked things out?

06:07.768 --> 06:09.537
Oh, yeah,
I squared things.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.338
I threw a fight
in Sacramento.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.306
Still got the scarlet
loaves to prove it.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.975
Scarlet loaves of bread?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.811
I believe he's referring
to blood in his stool, sir.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.280
Like matzo made with
the blood of gentiles.

06:20.448 --> 06:23.083
That sounds serious.
Have you been to a doctor?

06:23.183 --> 06:25.553
No, I hate doctors.
You know that.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.355
What if I came with you?
What, and hold my hand?

06:28.456 --> 06:30.724
Recently we had a very good
doctor on the show.

06:30.824 --> 06:34.495
Yeah, a little internal
bleeding never bothered me.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.999
Mmm, that was great.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.001
But sorry it was so fast.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.670
No, it was lovely.
Don't worry.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.738
You know, whenever
I make love,

06:44.838 --> 06:47.708
i.e., have premature
ejaculation,

06:47.808 --> 06:49.810
I like to think of that
speech from Blade Runner

06:49.910 --> 06:51.912
that Tyrell gives
to Rutger Hauer.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.381
What speech?
Oh.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.984
"The light that burns
twice as bright

06:57.084 --> 06:58.786
burns half as long,

06:58.886 --> 07:02.122
and you have burned
so very, very brightly, Roy."

07:02.222 --> 07:03.857
Oh.
So that's how I make love.

07:03.957 --> 07:07.160
Doesn't last long,
but burns bright.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.996
Celia, I knew it.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.065
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I smell ammonia.
Don't fall asleep.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.536
Dr. Rudy?

07:15.636 --> 07:17.505
Jim, what are you doing here?
How did you get in?

07:17.605 --> 07:21.341
I still have my keys
and the doorbell doesn't work

07:21.509 --> 07:23.076
and I've been
texting you all night.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.849
Oh, wait a second.

07:28.949 --> 07:33.854
That's not ammonia gas
I smell, it's spunk.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.189
You bastard.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.992
Jim, it's not what
you think, okay?

07:39.092 --> 07:40.894
Yes, we had sex
two and a half times,

07:40.994 --> 07:43.030
but it didn't mean anything.
I'm a married man.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.733
What? You're married?
I can't believe you
didn't tell me.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.702
You booty called me
at 2:00 in the morning.
I figured you knew.

07:52.239 --> 07:55.408
How dare you lie
to my Celia.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.910
I'm gonna kill you.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.411
Jim.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.648
Jim, I'm your
proctologist.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.882
I know how
to choke you out.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.551
Don't hurt him!
Don't hurt him!

08:06.954 --> 08:10.724
Jim, if I let you go,
you promise to be
reasonable?

08:10.824 --> 08:11.725
Fuck you.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.926
Oh, Jim.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.566
He's been inside
both of us,

08:18.632 --> 08:20.768
but I still love you.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.007
And he's out.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.413
Rafe, maybe you
should wait here.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.048
I don't want to get
you mixed up in this.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.784
Oh, come on, I'm used
to these lowlifes.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.686
It'll do you good
to go in with some muscle.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.988
You mean
additional muscle.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.190
All right, Rafe.

08:43.290 --> 08:47.494
It'll be like when you used
to come to work with me
when you were a boy.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.196
What are you
talking about?

08:49.296 --> 08:50.764
I never came
to work with you.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.834
You didn't?
Never too late.

09:10.017 --> 09:13.754
What I want to do
is flip this man, Rafe.
Make him our Deep Throat.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.223
Flip?
Yeah, bring him
on our side.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.126
Make him a source.
Prove that Rudolph Global

09:19.226 --> 09:20.661
have been trying
to silence me.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.129
Why do they want
to shut you up?

09:22.229 --> 09:24.031
Because I'm on to them.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.711
You got an appointment?

09:39.246 --> 09:41.081
Oh!

09:45.352 --> 09:47.487
I know you.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.857
I got a common face.

09:49.957 --> 09:53.260
I certainly recognize
you, Mr. Blunt.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.530
Oi, watch where
you're going, sir.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.332
Sorry, I'm nearsighted.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.169
You were at Echo Park Lake.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.771
I've been a lot of places.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.974
Yankee Stadium,
outdoor pissoirs
in Amsterdam,

10:07.074 --> 10:09.843
Three Mile Island
before it closed.

10:09.943 --> 10:13.046
Did you beat up
Cornelia White?

10:13.146 --> 10:15.248
I'm not hired
for the rough stuff.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.784
I got carpal tunnel.

10:16.884 --> 10:19.820
I only do surveillance
and blackmail.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.122
Then who hired you
to follow me?

10:24.892 --> 10:27.795
I am willing to pay
for this information.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.900
We were told by Barry
that you're the middleman
for the middleman

10:33.000 --> 10:34.768
for the middleman.
Now spill.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.904
I used to be
the middleman
for the middleman

10:37.004 --> 10:40.874
for the middleman,
but I got a promotion.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.976
How much you looking
to spend?

10:49.282 --> 10:52.019
and Scrabble and see
how the chemistry feels.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.856
Tonight?
Mm-hmm.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.791
I'm glad I shaved.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.693
Also, um, I wanted
to let you know

10:59.793 --> 11:03.596
I've put together
a segment on a new resort
being built in Chernobyl.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.432
It's for tragedy tourists.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.335
Oh, good.

11:08.435 --> 11:13.006
Walter's been looking
for a hopeful angle on
Chernobyl for years.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.249
He could have
injured my brain
choking me out like that.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.918
Let-- let's just
forget about it.
The past is dead.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.788
The-- the present is dead
and so's the future.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.156
Why'd you
have sex with him?

11:29.256 --> 11:30.858
Because that's what I do
when I'm in pain.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.827
You hoard,
I sleep around.
Oh, my God!

11:33.927 --> 11:35.863
Look, just look
at it this way--
now we're even.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.931
You slept with Evelyn,
I slept with Dr. Rudy.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.768
Okay, if we're even,
does that mean we're
back together?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.870
Because I can't take
much more of this.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.806
I thought we were gonna
be s-sweet friends forever.

11:45.906 --> 11:49.109
Look, I know.
Why don't we just not
have sex with anyone else

11:49.209 --> 11:51.111
until I'm not
confused anymore?
Okay.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.081
And then we can spend time
together as-- as friends

11:54.181 --> 11:57.851
and do things
like play chess.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.253
That all s-sounds
really good to me.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.889
Hi, guys.

12:01.989 --> 12:05.292
Jim, I brought you this
for your office.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.827
What is it?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.295
It's all my recycling.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.163
Wha--

12:10.263 --> 12:12.165
Shelly...

12:14.001 --> 12:16.036
this is so sweet.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.237
Oh.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.539
I'm gonna go arrange it
in my office right now.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.108
Okay.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.682
He's a big boy, sir.
He knows his own body.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.919
No, I'm worried, Harry.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.921
When we leave here,
call Dr. Rudy.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.355
Rafe won't go
and see him,

12:35.455 --> 12:37.925
but ask the doctor
if he will come
to my office.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.392
He owes me.
Yes, sir.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.694
Oh, shit! We have
to pick up a present

12:41.829 --> 12:43.630
for Vivian and Moby
for tonight.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.265
Hey, uh, Blunt.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.935
It's taking your son a lot
of time to get the cash.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.470
Now, you're not, uh,
stalling, are you?

12:50.570 --> 12:52.840
Don't worry,
he'll be back.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.108
You've got my
Queen Elizabeth mug.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.111
No, I saw it when
I was in your office

12:58.211 --> 13:00.848
and so, uh,
I got my own.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.749
You were in my office?

13:02.850 --> 13:04.217
I've been lots of places.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.220
Wrigley Field,
men's room at the Louvre,

13:07.320 --> 13:08.488
Mount Fuji.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.290
Oh, Rafe.
Got it.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.992
Great.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.294
All right, here it is.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.163
$10,000.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.866
I want you to go on-air
tonight and tell the truth.

13:18.932 --> 13:23.436
That Rudolph Global
hired you to shut me up
about recycled water.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.973
And you're going to hide
my face and my voice

13:26.073 --> 13:28.641
like they do
for whistle-blowers
and pervs?

13:28.876 --> 13:30.343
Of course.
Okay.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.245
Ah, you get the money
after the broadcast.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.381
Come with us now
to the office.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.885
No, I-I can't do that.
I'm seeing my cardiologist
in an hour.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.719
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.221
No, it's not ridiculous.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.491
It's impossible
to see this guy.
He's tops in LA.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.594
By the time I get
another appointment,
I'd be dead.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.362
Fine.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.731
Be at UBS at 4:00 P.M.

13:51.899 --> 13:55.602
I'll be there.
And, uh, I'll be
ready for my close-up.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.974
Are you sure, Walter?
I think it's risky.

14:01.074 --> 14:05.245
Yes, I'm sure.
All I want is to influence
the vote on Proposition 68.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.115
And putting Arbogast
on the show will help
achieve that.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.983
- Huh.
- Rafe?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.152
Celia, my love!

14:12.252 --> 14:13.420
Oh.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.789
Hey, Rafe,
put her down.
Put her down.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.926
Jim, my brother!
Oh, God!

14:18.992 --> 14:21.328
Walter, there's something
very important I'd like
to show you.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.397
Excuse me,
you look attractive.
Dr. Rudy?

14:24.497 --> 14:26.433
Oh, hey, babe.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.601
I'm gonna kill you.

14:28.701 --> 14:32.405
Hey, Jim, Dr. Rudy.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.942
Hi, Dr. Rudy.
Hi.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.377
Help me.
Help me.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.946
Help-- help me.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.948
Both of you
stop it right now.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.183
All right,
all right, all right.
That's enough, that's enough.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.386
Break it up. Break it up.
Oi, who is this clown?

14:46.486 --> 14:49.456
He's a doctor
I'd like you to see.
Oi!

14:49.556 --> 14:51.524
I can't believe
I've slept with
all of you.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.496
I'm a whore!

14:56.596 --> 14:59.532
No, Celia,
you're not the whore.
I am, remember?

14:59.632 --> 15:02.970
I'll go calm them down.
Should take four
to six minutes.

15:03.036 --> 15:06.974
Good. We'll all meet
in the conference room
as soon as they're pacified.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.177
Yes, Walter.
Doctor, this is my son Rafe.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.979
I'd like you
to examine him.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.982
Oh, well,
it's very nice
to meet you.

15:15.048 --> 15:18.285
Yeah.
The mother must have been
a very large woman.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.522
Am I wrong about that?

15:25.292 --> 15:29.096
This is what cats do,
not people.

15:29.196 --> 15:33.133
Vote against Proposition 68.
Paid for by People
for Clean Water.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.568
God, that cat looks
a lot like Beth.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.271
Yes, and what
I've discovered, Walter,
is that the super PAC

15:38.371 --> 15:40.473
is funded by a subsidiary,
three times removed,

15:40.573 --> 15:42.309
of the Rudolph water
bottling concern.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.477
Classic shell
corporation.

15:44.577 --> 15:49.116
Which is proposing
to build a desalinization
plant right here in LA.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.883
Excellent work,
both of you.

15:51.018 --> 15:54.021
Thank you, Walter.
It pleases me so much
that you should think so.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.589
I had the most awful
erotic dream where you
were standing--

15:56.689 --> 15:59.692
Can we try and stay on task?
Absolutely.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.129
What Celia found
plus Arbogast

16:02.229 --> 16:06.133
should give us
a strong one-two punch
for tonight's broadcast.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.035
And we can keep
the pressure on
the Rudolphs

16:08.101 --> 16:10.170
until Proposition 68
reopens the plant.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.940
Exactly, Jim.
Do you think the council's
gonna skip Proposition 69

16:14.041 --> 16:18.345
and go right to Proposition 70
so as to not offend anyone
who doesn't like oral sex?

16:18.445 --> 16:20.280
Who doesn't like oral sex?

16:20.380 --> 16:21.914
Mm-mmm.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.351
Oh, it's Arbogast.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.287
Yes, Mr. Arbogast?

16:27.387 --> 16:29.256
I can't make it tonight.
I'm sorry.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.457
We'll reschedule.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.959
Well, this is
not acceptable.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.561
You're not still
at the cardiologist?

16:34.661 --> 16:37.630
No, there's something big
that I-- I have to deal with.

16:37.730 --> 16:41.234
Come to my office
after your show.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.970
I have some new
information for you.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.505
What kind of information?

16:45.605 --> 16:48.808
The names of the men
who beat up Cornelia White.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.945
Damn it!

16:53.080 --> 16:55.415
We just lost
our smoking gun.
Arbogast can't make it.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.151
So we'll go with
our regular broadcast?

16:58.251 --> 17:00.387
Yes, buggeration.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.555
What do you have ready
that we can fill in?

17:04.291 --> 17:07.660
Pompeii, Auschwitz,
Ground Zero--

17:07.760 --> 17:10.763
for a long time, the travel
industry has been catering

17:10.863 --> 17:15.235
to what is known darkly
as tragedy tourism.

17:15.335 --> 17:19.339
Now you can add Chernobyl
to the list of places to go

17:19.439 --> 17:22.375
for those drawn
to the ghoulish
and the disturbing.

17:22.475 --> 17:26.113
Look, Doctor,
is this gonna
be over soon?

17:26.146 --> 17:28.348
I have a rehearsal
dinner to go to.

17:28.448 --> 17:33.186
Oh, don't worry.
I'm very fast with
my insertions.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.622
Have you ever seen
the movie Blade Runner?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.192
Where's Rafe, Harry?

17:39.292 --> 17:40.960
He'll meet us
at Arbogast's, sir.

17:41.128 --> 17:44.297
And then we'll go
to the rehearsal
dinner together.

17:44.397 --> 17:49.169
I told Rafe that Arbogast
had information about
Cornelia's assailants.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.605
Excellent.
You know, Harry,
it disturbs me

17:52.705 --> 17:55.975
when I think how much
Margaret Rudolph is
wrapped up in all this.

17:56.143 --> 18:00.180
Yes, sir.
I can't believe that I made
love to a sociopath.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.183
Wouldn't be
the first time, sir.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.685
If I had the logbook,
I could show you.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.760
Genital.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.595
That's seven letters,

18:15.695 --> 18:17.697
um, so that's 50 points
right there.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.900
And it's on a triple word
and the G is doubled.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.170
So that's 87 points.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.537
Oh!
Damn it!

18:24.637 --> 18:27.607
I hope you don't mind
I used a sort of dirty word.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.176
Oh, not at all.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.810
I love
the word genital.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.280
I guess it's been
on my mind since
Martin told me

18:33.380 --> 18:35.182
he's in the oral stage
of development,

18:35.248 --> 18:38.718
but still has
the genital and anal
stages to go through.

18:38.818 --> 18:42.422
I know, it's a lot
of work for him,

18:42.522 --> 18:45.625
but it will be worth it
when he graduates.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.260
I agree.

18:47.360 --> 18:51.198
Do you think his hair
looks better free-range
the way it is now

18:51.264 --> 18:53.566
or with a center part?
Free-range.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.636
His face is so beautiful,
it needs no adornment.

18:56.736 --> 19:00.373
Again, I agree with you.
We are very like-minded.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.074
Guys, can we please
keep playing?

19:02.209 --> 19:03.710
I have
really good letters.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.614
No looking.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.653
Where's Rafe?

19:13.753 --> 19:16.289
Hey, what is it,
Harry?

19:16.389 --> 19:20.427
Oh, I'm just thinking
about Sylvia, Major.

19:20.527 --> 19:24.431
I've stitched up my heart,
but the wound is infected

19:24.531 --> 19:28.968
with regret
and self-accusation
and longing--

19:29.236 --> 19:30.537
Oh, here's Rafe now.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.506
What did the doctor say?
I'm fine.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.075
I've been on a beet juice
cleanse to drop weight.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.578
That's why my stool was red.
I never made the connection.

19:38.678 --> 19:42.582
That's good news, Rafe.
So how is Dr. Rudy?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.417
Well, he's a little odd.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.753
He claims to be
a great womanizer.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.087
Really?

19:48.321 --> 19:50.323
Mmm, yeah.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.965
Oh, wow.

19:59.266 --> 20:01.067
Right?

20:01.301 --> 20:03.370
Wow?
Oh.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.171
That-- that's it?

20:05.272 --> 20:08.708
We got a hotel room
for a tryst and you
lasted one minute.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.545
How long did you last
with Celia?

20:14.213 --> 20:16.716
Have you ever seen
the movie Blade Runner?

20:32.799 --> 20:34.634
Mr. Arbogast?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.239
Oh, shit.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.376
Oh, my God.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.480
Good lord.
What happened to him?

20:47.580 --> 20:48.948
Looks like his head's
been bashed in.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.250
Oh, something like this
could have done it.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.419
No, Harry, put that down!

20:56.523 --> 20:59.426
Oh, he seemed
so alive and--

20:59.526 --> 21:01.861
and strange
just a few hours ago.

21:01.961 --> 21:05.732
Oh, my God, sir.
The logbook.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.234
He died clutching
the logbook.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.669
They'll think
I killed him.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.505
We must call the police.
What? No, no, we can't.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.173
We've been framed.
My--

21:14.341 --> 21:16.008
my prints are all over
the murder weapon.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.345
Oh, will these hands
ne'er be clean?

21:18.378 --> 21:20.880
Harry,
pull yourself together.
You're not Lady Macbeth.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.615
The police
will sort this out.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.551
The LAPD?
Are you kidding?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.353
I'm an illegal alien.
You are?

21:26.419 --> 21:28.821
Yes!
They'll have me on
the gallows in no time.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.723
We've got
to get out of here!

21:30.823 --> 21:31.824
Harry!

21:31.924 --> 21:33.960
Harry!

21:34.060 --> 21:36.429
Harry!

21:36.529 --> 21:38.365
Harry!

21:40.467 --> 21:42.769
Harry, stop!
I'm calling the police.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.938
Stop, police!

21:46.038 --> 21:48.508
I don't understand.
I haven't even dialed.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.009
Someone must have
tipped them off.

21:53.580 --> 21:54.914
Oh, shit!

21:55.014 --> 21:57.684
Gentlemen, I'm very happy
that you're here.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.519
We received a call,
Mr. Blunt.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.421
Yes, I was about
to call you myself.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.390
No, no, we're gonna
have to bring you in
for questioning.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.397
He's dead, all right.
Cuff both of them.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.864
No, that won't
be necessary.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.401
I can explain
everything.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.703
Ah!

22:16.803 --> 22:18.971
You won't cage me!

22:21.007 --> 22:23.710
Harry!
Hey, easy with
the old man.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.244
Don't put
your hands on me.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.414
Rafe!

22:36.756 --> 22:40.092
Celia?
Yes, Jim?

22:40.192 --> 22:44.664
Today you said you were
still too confused to get
back together,

22:44.764 --> 22:47.567
but you don't have
to be confused about me.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.903
Yeah, I know, Jim.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.305
What exactly are you
confused about?

22:53.440 --> 22:55.442
Everything.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.610
Who I am.
What I want.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.079
Where I'm going.
Why I'm here.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.449
Mmm.
Sex. Love.

23:02.515 --> 23:05.217
Babies. Death.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.219
Ooh!

23:07.454 --> 23:08.855
Checkmate.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.459
Oh, damn it.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.265
I like being friends.

23:19.466 --> 23:22.469
Yeah, it's great.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.511
Try counterclockwise.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.580
Oh, okay, yeah.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.120
Shelly, I'm sorry,
my wrist is killing me.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.822
Okay.
It's been, like,
45 minutes.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.257
Just a little longer.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.330
I have surgery tomorrow
and I really need this hand.

23:51.498 --> 23:54.066
If I'm paying for
half of this hotel room,
I want to come.

23:54.166 --> 23:57.504
You came.
I'll pay for
the whole room.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.340
I cannot believe

24:01.508 --> 24:03.943
that Walter blew off
our rehearsal dinner.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.111
Ah! Ah!

24:05.211 --> 24:06.813
He probably
is just having a hard time

24:06.913 --> 24:07.914
letting you go, honey.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.115
I-- I couldn't
let you go.

24:09.215 --> 24:10.750
Maybe you're right.
Ah!

24:10.850 --> 24:13.653
But I'm still
pissed at him!

24:13.753 --> 24:16.823
Ah! I love it when
you're mad at Walter.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.825
I'm Walter!
I'm Walter!

24:18.925 --> 24:20.693
How much do you love it?
I love you!

24:20.793 --> 24:23.663
Tell me.
I'm Walter! Ah!

24:23.763 --> 24:25.632
Good night, Rosalie.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.636
Good night, Rosalie.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.871
Good night, Rosalie.
Good night, Rosalie.

24:33.940 --> 24:37.043
I feel like my heart
can hold both of you,

24:37.143 --> 24:41.013
but am I going
to be punished
for being so happy?

24:41.113 --> 24:44.651
Yes, Martin,
we're all gonna
be punished.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.686
It's a cycle of life.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.656
So let's just enjoy
this while it lasts.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.891
You're very wise.
