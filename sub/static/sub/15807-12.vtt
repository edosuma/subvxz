¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.406 --> 00:07.471
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:07.541 --> 00:09.875
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:09.943 --> 00:12.143
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.212 --> 00:14.412
¶ The mate
   was a mighty sailing man ¶

00:14.481 --> 00:16.715
¶ The skipper brave and sure ¶

00:16.784 --> 00:19.184
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:19.252 --> 00:24.523
¶ For a three hour tour
    a three hour tour ¶

00:24.591 --> 00:26.324
[thunder]

00:26.393 --> 00:28.827
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:28.896 --> 00:30.796
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:30.864 --> 00:33.365
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:33.434 --> 00:38.136
¶ The Minnow would be lost,
  The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.205 --> 00:39.738

     on the shore ¶

01:16.210 --> 01:18.343
[Christmas carol tune on radio]

01:22.082 --> 01:24.849
It's not like we're celebrating
Christmas with a bamboo tree.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.918
[all laughing]

01:26.987 --> 01:28.720
And sea shells
                  for ornaments.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.755
Well, it's the best
we could do here on the Island.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.825
Right! You know
   what I want for Christmas?

01:32.893 --> 01:35.727
A nice thick
          juicy steak.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.496
I know what I'd like
      for Christmas

01:37.564 --> 01:41.467
but I don't think Cary Grant
  will fit in my stocking.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.569
You know what I want?
I wish I could be rescued.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.670
Oh, what a wonderful
   Christmas wish, Gilligan.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.306
I'm afraid that's asking just a
bit too much from Santa Clause.

01:48.375 --> 01:51.777
(man on radio)
 'We interrupt this program to
 bring you a news bulletin.'

01:51.846 --> 01:53.711
'A group of castaways
     were spotted'

01:53.780 --> 01:57.649
'on a small island a short time
ago by our navy weather plane.'

01:57.718 --> 02:00.786
'These maroon people are
 believed to be the passengers'

02:00.854 --> 02:01.819
'of the S.S. Minnow.'

02:01.888 --> 02:04.021
- Oh, yeah!
          - Yay!

02:04.090 --> 02:07.759
'A small excursion boat which
 was presumed lost at sea.'

02:07.827 --> 02:10.662
'In the event the castaways
  can hear this broadcast'

02:10.731 --> 02:13.632
'let me assure them, that a navy
destroyer has been dispatched'

02:13.700 --> 02:15.533
'to the area pinpointed
    by the plane.'

02:15.602 --> 02:18.303
'We now return you
    to our regular program.'

02:18.372 --> 02:19.971
[all celebrating]

02:20.040 --> 02:21.440
What a Christmas present.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.709
For Christmas I wanna
buy everybody their own island.

02:35.088 --> 02:36.388
Yeah, that fire
and smoke gotta help

02:36.456 --> 02:38.022
that navy destroyer
to spot us.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.525
Right, Skipper. Lucky you didn't
burst away the Christmas wish.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.460
Oh, you're so right,
little buddy.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.395
I wanna tell you, you've had
your share of mistakes

02:44.464 --> 02:47.131
but that wish has made up
for all of them.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.767
Nothing you could do now
can make me angry.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.968
Thanks, Skipper.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.870
Well, let's see if we can
spot that ship out there.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.405
Hand me the binocular.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.778
Come on, Gilligan. I said
hand me the binocular.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.151
You know what you said, Skipper.

03:06.219 --> 03:07.853
You're not gonna
                get angry at me.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.325
You did it, Skipper.
        You controlled yourself.

03:14.394 --> 03:17.328
- Congratulations.
      - Thanks, Gilligan.

03:17.397 --> 03:18.930
As a matter of fact,
we've suffered through

03:18.999 --> 03:22.500
worse experiences. Remember when
we first landed on the island?

03:22.569 --> 03:24.869
I sure do. After I lost
   the anchor, the compass broke

03:24.938 --> 03:26.705
during the storm.
       I thought we were goners.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.041
But we were real lucky,
little buddy.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.875
I mean the fact
that the tide left us

03:30.944 --> 03:32.744
high and dry during the night.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.300
Hey, Gilligan.

03:58.204 --> 03:59.371
Gilligan!

04:00.441 --> 04:01.706
Oh, my gosh!

04:01.775 --> 04:03.040
Man overboard.

04:03.109 --> 04:04.943
I'll save you, Skipper!

04:11.385 --> 04:15.420
Gilligan, our Minnow's
     been beached.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.755
Beached? When the storm
was over and it was calm

04:17.824 --> 04:19.156
you said we'd
     be home in no time.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.690
It may take longer.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.894
When the passengers wake up,
what are you gonna tell them?

04:22.963 --> 04:24.296
Think of something.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.165
How we gonna get home,
  look at those holes.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.733
No, Skipper,
I'm very happy to be here.

04:28.801 --> 04:30.802
I'm so happy,
I could kiss the ground.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.640
This island tastes terrible.

04:35.708 --> 04:38.076
Oh, Captain.
             Oh, Captain.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.678
Have your man remove our luggage
from this vessel.

04:40.747 --> 04:42.313
I'd be very happy to,
     Mr. Howell.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.416
Where would you have it
    removed to?

04:44.484 --> 04:46.617
Oh, some place where
    the limousine can pick it up

04:46.686 --> 04:48.520
and take us
           to the nearest hotel.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.788
That storm drove us hundreds
  of miles off course.

04:50.857 --> 04:53.492
This island doesn't even
   appear on my navy charts.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.561
You should've gotten your charts
from a more reliable source.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.130
There is no more reliable source
in the U.S. Navy.

04:59.199 --> 05:03.501
Oh, yes there is...
The Sunnybrook Yacht. My outfit.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.870
'Come along, Lovey.'

05:06.539 --> 05:08.506
You know, I think someone
       ought to report him.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.609
- Well, he'll be the watch.
  - I do.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.011
You mean we're marooned?

05:13.080 --> 05:16.080
Shush! Not loud. We have three
women on board that might panic.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.716
You have one sailor down here
 that already has.

05:18.785 --> 05:22.487
I think I'll have another try
 fixing that transmitter.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.389
You mean the radio is broken?

05:24.458 --> 05:26.691
Transmitter's broken,
the receiver works fine.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.426
With no transmitter, how we
     gonna tell the rescue ship

05:28.495 --> 05:30.595
where to find us?
        But Skipper, I'm scared.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.564
Gilligan, now pull yourself
together.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.499
There's really
nothing to worry about.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.601
Sure, we're marooned
on an uncharted island.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.604
Transmitter's broken, the boats
wrecked. We're low on provision.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.606
But, does that sound
like the end of the world?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.775
No. But, it sounds
             like the end of us.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.344
Gilligan, your job now
is to calm the passengers.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.778
- Cheer 'em up.
        - Yes, sir.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.881
Keep 'em calm.
                  Cheer 'em up.

05:49.949 --> 05:52.484
Want those people to hear
your teeth chattering?

05:52.552 --> 05:53.885
Let me have a smile.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.221
If I smile, sir, they'll see
    my teeth chattering.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.757
- Gilligan!
       - Yes, sir. Smile.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.528
You certainly
               do look cheerful.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.564
That's probably
       'cause I'm smiling.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.265
We got a message through,
we're gonna be saved.

06:07.334 --> 06:10.368
No, we couldn't get a message
 through. Transmitter's broken.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.937
Broken? That's nothing
to smile about.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.107
No, it isn't.
         No, it isn't.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.609
Then why were you smiling?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.744
Skipper's orders.
 I'm supposed to cheer you up.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.145
What for?

06:21.214 --> 06:22.814
So, you won't worry about
   the terrible mess we're in.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.016
Terrible mess? Oh, Gilligan.
  Are we in danger?

06:25.085 --> 06:29.054
Danger? What makes you say
a thing like that?

06:29.123 --> 06:30.955
Gilligan, we're in awful
        trouble, aren't we?

06:31.024 --> 06:33.691
Not really, there's a chance
the transmitter can be fixed.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.993
There's every possibility
we won't be eaten by cannibals.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.597
If we're careful, we can stretch
our food supply to last a week.

06:39.666 --> 06:43.034
When you think about it,
things couldn't be worse.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.703
I want you two to see what you
 can savage out of the galley.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.473
Meanwhile, Gilligan and I
   will explore the island.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.041
Gilligan!

06:50.110 --> 06:52.443
I got the equipment here.
  I knew you're gonna need it.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.346
Good work, let's get started.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.781
Yes, sir.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.636
There's exactly
  what I've been looking for.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.672
It's a coconut tree,
   we've passed a 1,000 of them.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.206
If you've seen one,
           you've seen them all.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.575
Not like this one.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.010
'This is gotta be
the tallest tree on the island.'

07:26.079 --> 07:29.514
Now from the top of this tree,
we can see the whole island.

07:29.582 --> 07:31.382
Then we'll know
whether it's uninhabited or not.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.117
That's a great idea, Skipper.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.885
But whose gonna climb up there
and look around.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.654
I mean,
       it's only two of us here.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.723
And you can't do it
     because you're the skipper.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.560
I can't do because I don't know
how to climb a coconut tree.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.064
Besides, I'm afraid of heights.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.732
I'm not starting
      any mutiny, Skipper.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.435
But I'm not
     climbing up that tree.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.904
No, siree. Not me.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.674
'What do you see?'

07:56.743 --> 07:59.744
Nothing. I got my eyes closed.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.748
There's nothing to be
    afraid of. Look around.

08:07.955 --> 08:11.223
Hey, you are right, Skipper.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.625
I can see the whole island
   from up here.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.763
Look out below.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.765
Thanks for the warning.

08:24.604 --> 08:29.407
Hey, I see something.
     I see some people.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.942
Is it a village?

08:31.011 --> 08:34.645
It's just some people.
But they have a boat, Skipper.

08:34.714 --> 08:37.782
They can get us off here.
   Skipper, we're safe.

08:54.901 --> 08:58.402
I'm sorry, Skipper.
I'm just so anxious.

08:58.471 --> 09:01.306
Never mind that.
                Are you--

09:01.374 --> 09:03.375
Are you sure
            you saw some people?

09:03.443 --> 09:04.809
Yes, sir, and a boat too.
We're safe.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.878
Just follow me.
I know exactly where it is.

09:08.248 --> 09:11.550
Right this way, Skipper.
   I'm blazing the old flag.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.258
We're safe, we're safe.
   Come on, Skipper. Come on.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.064
Here's the beach.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.067
Wait till we tell the passengers
the good news.

09:31.905 --> 09:37.642
Woo-hoo! Look, Skipper, look.
Yippee! Yeah! Yippee! Yahoo!

09:37.711 --> 09:39.744
Yippee! Yahoo..

09:48.888 --> 09:51.856
Skipper, will you switch
        that to our frequency?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.224
I can hold
        these two wires together

09:53.293 --> 09:56.828
and then will you try
           talking into it?

09:56.896 --> 10:01.198
Hello? Hello? If anyone
  can hear me, please answer.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.102
- I can hear you fine.
     - It works. It works.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.536
- Skipper--
  - Just a minute, Professor.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.704
I think I've got something.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.806
Where are you?

10:08.875 --> 10:11.009
Right behind you.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.981
Gilligan! We're trying
    to fix the transmitter.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.351
Oh, maybe if you took
  one of these tubes in here.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.655
The Professor and I
will fix the transmitter.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.757
Why don't you try and catch
something for dinner?

10:25.825 --> 10:29.494
Right, Skipper.
        How about fish?

10:29.563 --> 10:32.830
Fish sounds just fine.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.633
Skipper, have you got
          a smaller screwdriver?

10:35.702 --> 10:37.702
I think I have
in my tool kit.

10:42.743 --> 10:46.778
Testing. One, two, three, four.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.647
Testing. One, two, three, four.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.883
It works! I fixed it.

10:51.952 --> 10:56.020
Skipper! Skipper! It works.
The transmitter works.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.156
My voice just came over
the radio.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.991
I found a break in the circuit
 and I fixed it..

11:01.060 --> 11:02.794
It was right here
on the rock.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.229
Well, how could it
              just vanish?

11:04.297 --> 11:07.465
(Professor)
        'The transmitter
        was right here.'

11:07.533 --> 11:10.001
Now, I know
            how it could vanish.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.988
Hi, Skipper,
      going in for a dip?

11:31.457 --> 11:32.424
Ah!

11:37.096 --> 11:39.697
Yes, sir, all in all,
 I'd say we were pretty lucky.

11:39.766 --> 11:40.965
Hey, listen to this.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.800
Should be just
     a matter of hours now.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.404
(male reporter)
'And a coast guard reports it is
now nearing the island.'

11:46.473 --> 11:48.907
'According to all indications
 the crew and passengers'

11:48.975 --> 11:51.942
'of the S.S. Minnow will shortly
be leaving the island where'

11:52.011 --> 11:54.679
'they have been marooned.'

11:54.748 --> 11:57.315
Oh, we owe it all to Gilligan
 and his Christmas wish.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.451
Oh, that's right.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.955
- I feel like I'm on fire.
   - You are.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.025
Get your feet
        out of the fire.

12:13.632 --> 12:16.534
I can't see any ship.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.102
Won't be long now.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.437
Where's the rescue party?

12:19.506 --> 12:21.105
I thought this was
      an afternoon affair.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.773
They'll be here
    any time now, Mr. Howell.

12:22.842 --> 12:27.078
I certainly hope so or I'll have
to change into evening clothes.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.846
Gilligan and I were talking
  about the first day

12:28.915 --> 12:29.881
we landed here,
        remember that?

12:29.949 --> 12:31.415
How can we
        ever forget.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.851
We were all simply furious
   with Gilligan that day.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.152
Certainly were.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.222
I guess everybody
      was mad at me then.

12:39.492 --> 12:43.127
- More Blankets, one hatchet.
 - Check.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.296
A pistol, flashlight
and a pair of binoculars.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.799
Right. Well,
      that completes the list of

12:47.867 --> 12:49.901
everything we can
          salvage from the boat.

12:49.969 --> 12:53.437
Skipper, how long do you really
 think we'll be on this island.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.406
The transmitter on
the bottom of the ocean.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.042
We're stuck here until we're
spotted by a plane or a ship.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.845
That could be days
        or weeks or even months.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.847
We got one box
                of matches left.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.682
- Hi.
       - Oh, hi, Gilligan.

13:04.751 --> 13:05.816
Gilligan.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.586
You got to use these
            very sparingly.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.121
Gilligan.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.356
Skipper, why don't you two
      get a fire started.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.792
I'll go help the others gather
  more wood to keep it going.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.528
Good idea, Professor.

13:18.330 --> 13:21.432
Well, don't just stand here.
Go get some brush for the fire.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.967
Aye aye, sir.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.772
Gilligan, got the fire
     ready to start yet?

13:27.841 --> 13:30.207
- Fire ready to start, sir.
  - Good.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.644
Remember now, we've got to try
and do this with only one match.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.178
Only one match, sir.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.281
- We've got to be careful.
   - Got to be careful.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.082
Gilligan, will you
do me a favor?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.150
Do you a favor?
               Yes, indeed, sir.

13:40.219 --> 13:42.353
Will you stop repeating
everything I say?

13:42.421 --> 13:44.989
Stop repeating everything
    you say? Right you are, sir.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.591
No more repeating
             everything you say.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.193
Gilligan!

13:49.262 --> 13:51.996
Alright now, the minute
I get the fire started

13:52.064 --> 13:54.098
I want you to
blow into it like this.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.500
[Skipper blowing]

13:56.302 --> 13:57.568
Like this?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.037
[Gilligan blowing]

14:00.907 --> 14:03.074
Okay, here we go.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.943
[Gilligan blowing]

14:10.350 --> 14:13.384
Guess I blew
                  too soon, huh?

14:13.453 --> 14:16.320
Well, I'm sure not going
       to do that the next time.

14:16.389 --> 14:21.492
'Cause you're not gonna
         let me do it next time.

14:21.561 --> 14:25.096
- Skipper, can I help you?
   - No, Gilligan.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.132
- Please?
    - It's no use, Gilligan.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.236
You're just plain,
old bad luck to me.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.171
You remember
the time on that destroyer

14:34.240 --> 14:35.906
when the death charge
broke loose?

14:35.975 --> 14:37.508
Yes, sir. It was rolling
        across the deck.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.744
I pulled you away
      and saved your life.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.679
Well, not exactly.
You didn't save it.

14:41.748 --> 14:42.947
You just prolonged it.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.149
'So you'd give me
more bad luck.'

14:45.218 --> 14:47.551
You run along.
I've got lot of work to do.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.087
Aye aye, sir.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.793
Oh-oh!

14:55.861 --> 14:58.296
Shove off, Gilligan!

15:00.834 --> 15:02.934
[orchestra music]

15:26.392 --> 15:29.994
- Darling, look at that.
    - Why, it's Gilligan.

16:15.175 --> 16:19.077
At a time like this, water
sports. I mean, really?

16:47.740 --> 16:51.475
(man on radio)
  'And now, it's time for
  your daily exercise again.'

16:51.544 --> 16:54.311

 breath and let the good old'

16:54.380 --> 16:56.914
'tropical sun help you
     stay in shape.'

16:56.982 --> 16:59.984
'First lets try a simple
  knee bend. Hand's on hips.'

17:00.053 --> 17:02.687
'Now bend at the knee's
    and here we go.'

17:02.755 --> 17:09.594
'One, two, three, four.
    One, two, three, four.'

17:09.662 --> 17:16.066
'Up, down, three, four.
    Up, down, three, four.'

17:16.135 --> 17:17.067
'Come on you,
      let's get with it.'

17:17.136 --> 17:18.403
Me?

17:18.471 --> 17:21.271
'I mean you, yes.
     Up we go, down we go.'

17:21.339 --> 17:23.140
'Up we go,
          down we go.'

'Up, down, up, down.'

17:34.387 --> 17:37.588
'Ah that's enough now, relax.'

17:37.657 --> 17:39.557
[song on radio]

17:43.663 --> 17:47.064
The radio. The fish must have
 swallowed the radio.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.801
[indistinct radio commentary]

17:54.874 --> 17:56.507
Come on, Roger.
        Get ahead.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.310
[song on radio]

18:00.880 --> 18:03.214
The radio. I gotta tell 'em
  I caught the radio.

18:09.522 --> 18:13.624
I caught the radio.
    Look, I caught the radio.

18:13.693 --> 18:17.127
[music plays]
      Well, I'll be darned.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.063
The fish must've
            swallowed the radio.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.464
If this fish
      swallowed the radio

18:20.533 --> 18:21.965
maybe an other one
   swallowed the transmitter.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.035
Gilligan, the chances of that
   are absolutely zero.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.636
But Professor,
what've we got to lose?

18:25.705 --> 18:28.038
Gilligan, go get
the rest of those fish.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.109
- Aye aye, sir.
        - Gilligan!

18:34.147 --> 18:35.112
Now ladies, I want
you to pick up a fish

18:35.181 --> 18:36.580
and start
squeezing them.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.849
Maybe we can find
 the fish with the transmitter.

18:38.917 --> 18:42.219
Yeah, wait a minute.
 Skipper, I just tuned the radio

18:42.288 --> 18:43.854
to the same wavelength
     as the transmitter.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.490
If you talk into the fish
 and the transmitter's in there

18:46.559 --> 18:48.759
we should hear it
       on the radio.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.127
Great idea, professor.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.162
But don't just
stand there, Gilligan.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.197
Say something
into the fish.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.465
I've never talked
       to a fish before.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.500
- Say anything.
      - Hello there fish.

18:56.568 --> 18:59.236
- Louder.
      - Hello there fish.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.273
That's not it.
        Try another one.

19:02.341 --> 19:05.642
- Hello. Hello Kansas.
     - Hello.

19:05.711 --> 19:09.179
Hello, the S.S. Minnow.
   Skipper of the S.S. Minnow

19:09.248 --> 19:11.748
on an uncharted island..

19:11.817 --> 19:15.585
Hello, uncle George. Having
 a very nice time, uncle George.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.323
I'll be back
     in Kansas pretty soon.

19:19.391 --> 19:22.526
Hello coastguard,
     this is Ginger Grant.

19:22.595 --> 19:26.196
I sing and I dance
      and lots of things.

19:26.265 --> 19:28.899
The owl and the pussycat
    went to sea

19:28.968 --> 19:31.302

        pea green boat.

19:32.471 --> 19:35.072
[indistinct chattering]

19:35.141 --> 19:37.474
I have never in my
entire life. I--

19:37.543 --> 19:42.212
Don't just stand there,
 Mr. Howell, talk into a fish.

19:42.281 --> 19:43.981
- Talk into it?
     - Talk into the fish.

19:44.050 --> 19:49.052
Oh, heavens. Hello there.
This is Thurston Howell.

19:49.121 --> 19:52.389
Yes, I want
long distance.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.324
Alright, Gilligan,
       you can watch.

19:54.393 --> 19:56.760
But don't come any closer.
Stay right here.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.095
Yes, sir.

19:58.164 --> 20:00.097
Professor, I don't know how
those fish managed to swallow

20:00.166 --> 20:01.531
the radio
and the transmitter.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.134
But at least we got
a chance again. How's it coming?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.637
Just give me a little time and
 I think I'll have it working.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.206
Maybe if you kept this
and kind of tried this--

20:09.275 --> 20:11.575
Give me
that screwdriver.

20:11.643 --> 20:14.745
Skipper, isn't there
   anything I can do to help?

20:14.813 --> 20:18.816
Yes, Gilligan, get some more
wood for the fire. Lots of wood.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.453
How's the Professor doing
   with the transmitter?

20:23.522 --> 20:24.822
Almost got it fixed.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.390
- Oh, that's great.
      - That's wonderful.

20:26.458 --> 20:29.193
Well, I must say that is
    a lovely turn of events.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.194
You think you could
      reach my broker?

20:31.263 --> 20:32.730
Oh, my agent in Hollywood?

20:32.798 --> 20:35.165
Could you reach my mother?
   She's in Winfield Kansas.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.568
Oh, if you reach your mother
 would you ask her to telephone

20:37.636 --> 20:39.403
the Bigsby tailors
       in Newport?

20:39.472 --> 20:41.906
We're expected there
     for dinner on Tuesday.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.408
Please folks, I think the first
thing we should do is get in

20:44.477 --> 20:46.210
touch with somebody
      that has a boat.

20:46.278 --> 20:47.644
[radio picks up signal]
    Wait a minute.

20:47.713 --> 20:50.514
I think it's working.
     Here, Skipper, try it.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.550
I'll take the radio.

20:53.619 --> 20:57.588
CQ. Come in, CQ.
     CQ, this is a mayday.

20:57.656 --> 21:00.524
This is a mayday.
       Calling CQ.

21:00.593 --> 21:04.495
- CQ, calling CQ.
    - Skipper, where can I--

21:04.564 --> 21:06.030
Not now, Gilligan.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.565
Stay where you are.
     Don't come any closer.

21:08.634 --> 21:10.233
(Skipper)
       'CQ, calling CQ.'

21:10.302 --> 21:11.735
But Skipper,
     these logs are heavy.

21:11.804 --> 21:15.572
- Calling CQ. CQ.
    - I hear it! I hear it!

21:15.641 --> 21:19.877
It means it works.
      Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

21:19.946 --> 21:24.648
If anyone can hear me, this is
the Skipper of the S.S. Minnow.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.584
- Where can I put 'em?
   - Just drop 'em anywhere.

21:27.653 --> 21:30.254
- This is the Skipper--
    - Drop 'em?

21:30.322 --> 21:32.189
Drop 'em!

21:32.258 --> 21:34.492
[logs crash]

21:46.305 --> 21:47.704
Wait a minute, Skipper.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.606
I know what your gonna say
   and you're right.

21:49.675 --> 21:51.475
I've been nothing
   but trouble to everybody.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.610
I threw the radio
       in the ocean..

21:53.679 --> 21:55.679
...and I just crushed
     the transmitter.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.280
But I'll make it
       up to you, honest.

21:57.349 --> 21:58.582
How, Gilligan?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.718
You don't have to pay me
    for this weeks work.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.994
- Still don't see a thing.
   - Nothing there.

22:11.063 --> 22:12.495
When we get back
       I'm going to have

22:12.564 --> 22:14.364
the entire navy
       demoted for this.

22:14.433 --> 22:17.168
Well perhaps, we can get some
 information on the radio.

22:17.236 --> 22:18.836
(man on radio)
   'And here's another flash
   about the exciting'

22:18.904 --> 22:22.038
'rescue of the castaways.

22:22.107 --> 22:24.341
'up all the passengers
  and crew who were marooned'

22:24.410 --> 22:25.809
'on the tropical island.'

22:25.878 --> 22:27.477
Picked them up?

22:27.546 --> 22:30.046
(man on radio)
   'And they're bringing them
   back to civilization.'

22:30.115 --> 22:31.916
'According to earlier reports
 they were believed'

'to be survivors from
     the S.S. Minnow.'

22:34.420 --> 22:35.986
Well, it wasn't
    our island they sighted.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.422
It was another island
     with other castaways.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.691
Oh, we're not going
      to be saved.

22:40.759 --> 22:43.427
(man on radio)
  'So the happy group that was
  marooned for 11 years..'

(man on radio)
   '...are safe and steaming
   for home aboard.'

22:48.033 --> 22:49.199
'the coastguard cutter.'

22:49.268 --> 22:50.568
Coastguard cutter?

22:50.636 --> 22:53.036
We thought it was going
    to be the Navy at least.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.272
Oh, I'm glad they
    didn't find our island.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.675
We're both
     terribly overdressed.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.878
Don't feel so bad.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.712
The other group
   was stranded for 11 years.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.715
We'll get rescued in ten.

23:04.783 --> 23:10.287
Nine. Eight.
       Seven. Six. Five.

23:10.356 --> 23:11.822
Four. Three.
          Two. One.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.837
Christmas Eve,
and we're still on this island.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.472
Yes, I thought for sure
    we'd be home by now.

23:28.540 --> 23:29.739
I'm sorry.

23:29.808 --> 23:32.709
Oh, Gilligan,
      it's not your fault.

23:32.778 --> 23:38.515
Merry, merry Christmas.
Oh, merry Christmas to you all.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.850
Well, thank you, Santa.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.353
Please tell us
what we have to be merry about?

23:42.421 --> 23:44.688
Why, certainly, good, sir.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.390
You might have been lost at sea
and never reached this island.

23:47.459 --> 23:48.925
- He's right.
        - That's right.

23:48.994 --> 23:51.962
Or you might have hit an island
that had no food or water.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.196
That's right too.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.466
Or you might have all been,
  enemies by now.

23:55.535 --> 23:58.735
Instead of the family group
 that you are, who all learned

23:58.804 --> 24:00.070
to get along
        with each other.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.472
By George, this bearded
    gentleman is right.

24:02.541 --> 24:03.773
That's right, good, sir.

24:03.842 --> 24:06.409
So remember
     and be of good spirit.

24:06.478 --> 24:08.913
Merry Christmas to all.

24:08.981 --> 24:12.616
Ha-ha-ho-ho-ho.
        Merry Christmas.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.122
What's everybody
        looking at?

24:25.798 --> 24:27.831
What's everybody
        looking at?

24:27.900 --> 24:30.133
You'll never
      believe it, Skipper.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.735
Merry Christmas.

24:31.804 --> 24:35.239
Merry Christmas, Gilligan.
  Thank you. Merry Christmas.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.112
- Merry Christmas, Skipper.
  - Merry Christmas.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.981
(Santa and elves together)
   'Merry Christmas.'

24:44.050 --> 24:46.550
'Merry Christmas.
       Merry Christmas.'

25:02.835 --> 25:04.901
¶ They're here for
       a long long time ¶

25:04.970 --> 25:07.403
¶ They'll have to
   make the best of things ¶

25:07.472 --> 25:09.205
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:09.274 --> 25:11.541
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

25:11.610 --> 25:13.443
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:13.512 --> 25:17.881
¶ To make the others comfortable
In their tropic island nest ¶

25:17.950 --> 25:22.185
¶ No phone, no lights, no motor
car, not a single luxury ¶

25:22.254 --> 25:26.690
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe
   It's primitive as can be ¶

25:26.758 --> 25:28.992
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:29.061 --> 25:31.028
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:31.097 --> 25:35.666
¶ From seven stranded castaways
Here on Gilligan's Isle ¶¶

25:36.305 --> 25:42.934
