WEBVTT

00:04.125 --> 00:07.393
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aw.

00:07.655 --> 00:08.823
Ahh.

00:09.575 --> 00:10.575
Ahh.

00:10.955 --> 00:12.288
Unbelievable.

00:12.715 --> 00:15.201
I wouldn't have believed it
myself, had I not watched

00:15.226 --> 00:16.625
the whole thing in the mirror.

00:17.675 --> 00:20.142
If Jerry ever knew I was having sex

00:20.167 --> 00:23.859
with Eddie Penisi, he'd go psycho.

00:23.884 --> 00:25.876
Ooh, how psycho are we talking?

00:26.452 --> 00:27.523
Does it turn you on?

00:27.548 --> 00:28.921
Yeah, a little bit.

00:30.177 --> 00:31.598
Okay, a lot.

00:32.019 --> 00:33.361
You think he'd be mad, huh?

00:33.583 --> 00:35.959
He would go into a rage if he knew

00:35.984 --> 00:38.647
that you ravaged his
childhood sweetheart.

00:38.649 --> 00:40.878
Go on, but talk slower.

00:41.768 --> 00:42.807
Shit, I think he's here.

00:42.832 --> 00:44.552
No, no, no. Don't skip to the end.

00:44.577 --> 00:45.637
I want to savor this.

00:45.639 --> 00:46.971
I just heard his keys in the door.

00:46.973 --> 00:48.106
Mmm, yeah. That's good.

00:48.108 --> 00:49.255
The details are everything.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.371
- Lola.
- Huh?

00:50.420 --> 00:51.420
We need to talk.

00:51.445 --> 00:53.111
Holy shit. He really is here.

00:53.113 --> 00:54.119
Under the bed.

00:54.781 --> 00:56.180
I thought you guys were separated.

00:56.182 --> 00:58.689
We are. I just haven't
changed the locks.

00:59.383 --> 01:00.883
Lola, where are you?!

01:05.037 --> 01:06.354
Jerry, no.

01:06.593 --> 01:09.142
One more chance, baby. Come on.

01:09.167 --> 01:11.438
I've learned my lesson.
From now on, Daddy Bear

01:11.463 --> 01:13.709
keeps his service
revolver in his holster,

01:13.734 --> 01:16.646
and he also stops
sleeping with other women.

01:18.272 --> 01:19.562
You look great.

01:20.151 --> 01:21.250
Well, just let me get dressed.

01:21.275 --> 01:22.742
I'll meet you in the kitchen.

01:24.790 --> 01:25.790
Okay.

01:30.350 --> 01:32.726
He calls himself Daddy Bear?
I thought I was a freak.

01:32.751 --> 01:33.885
How do I get you out of here?

01:33.887 --> 01:34.914
I got this.

01:35.518 --> 01:36.630
Eddie, you can't do that.

01:36.655 --> 01:37.789
We're three stories up.

01:38.170 --> 01:39.981
- Eddie!
- You're dynamite.

01:40.006 --> 01:41.938
- No!
- Whoo!

01:41.963 --> 01:43.612
- Yeah!
- Alright!

01:43.637 --> 01:45.819
- Good form.
- Rock 'n' roll, baby.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.886
- Look at him.
- Oh, wow.

01:48.021 --> 01:50.435
I am on a roll. Thanks, guys.

01:50.460 --> 01:51.503
Hey, no problem, man.

01:51.505 --> 01:52.904
We were right down the
street at Starbucks.

01:52.906 --> 01:54.506
Oh, did you get me a grande macchiato

01:54.508 --> 01:55.774
and low-fat raspberry muffin?

01:55.776 --> 01:56.863
We sure did.

01:56.888 --> 01:58.287
You're lucky we were
in the neighborhood.

01:58.312 --> 01:59.397
I'm not lucky.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.118
I'm Eddie Penisi.

02:01.143 --> 02:03.936
- Hey.
- Son of a bitch.

02:25.651 --> 02:27.783
Thank you all so much for joining us

02:27.808 --> 02:30.008
for this year's Tacoma Police Department

02:30.010 --> 02:32.877
versus Fire Department
charity boxing match.

02:32.879 --> 02:35.547
- Yeah!
- Sorry, Chief.

02:35.549 --> 02:38.121
Didn't mean to use the word
"match" in your presence.

02:38.485 --> 02:39.735
Oh, it's okay.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.753
You used a different
meaning of the word, so...

02:44.023 --> 02:45.023
So true.

02:45.395 --> 02:48.396
Well, I know the press has
a lot of questions, so...

02:48.495 --> 02:51.199
Yes, Ken Walthers,
"My Neighborhood App."

02:51.431 --> 02:54.433
Care to comment about the
missing dog on Maple Drive?

02:55.052 --> 02:56.656
Okay, no one from the real press?

02:57.792 --> 02:59.615
Well, then I will announce the matchups.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.839
Yeah!

03:00.841 --> 03:03.775
This year promises four
thrilling showdowns,

03:03.777 --> 03:07.846
TFD Engineer Ike Crystal will
take on Officer Leonard Tubbs,

03:07.848 --> 03:09.982
and Officer Brad Shuck
will go toe-to-toe

03:09.984 --> 03:12.214
with Paramedic Granville Smith.

03:12.609 --> 03:16.188
Officer Liz Salazar will
take on Lucy McConky,

03:16.190 --> 03:18.256
who is a collegiate judo champ.

03:18.258 --> 03:19.924
I'd like to take a moment to introduce

03:19.926 --> 03:21.993
a special young man in the crowd,

03:21.995 --> 03:24.929
volunteer junior police
explorer Bucky Edelstein,

03:24.931 --> 03:26.931
who walks the German
Shepherd on weekends.

03:26.933 --> 03:28.533
Aw.

03:28.535 --> 03:32.671
Young Bucky will take on
TFD's very own Andy Myawani.

03:32.673 --> 03:36.008
Now, who's ready for some trash talk?

03:38.144 --> 03:39.607
Captain Polonsky.

03:46.655 --> 03:48.251
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

03:48.365 --> 03:51.667
We look forward to showing Grit City.

03:51.692 --> 03:55.293
Which department has the most grit.

03:55.295 --> 03:57.533
- Boom!
- TPD!

03:58.058 --> 04:01.211
And as far as Tacoma FD is concerned,

04:01.299 --> 04:04.858
well, you have the right

04:04.883 --> 04:07.440
to receive a first-degree beatdown.

04:07.465 --> 04:10.323
- Oh!
- Oh!

04:10.348 --> 04:12.482
You have the right

04:12.507 --> 04:15.130
to have the bitch slapped out of you.

04:16.050 --> 04:17.849
If you cannot stand up after,

04:17.851 --> 04:21.519
a stretcher will be provided for you.

04:23.523 --> 04:25.784
- TPD out!
- TPD!

04:31.768 --> 04:32.967
Wow.

04:33.199 --> 04:35.525
Talk about your Miranda Wrongs.

04:36.880 --> 04:40.948
Okay, now let's get fired
up for Chief Terry McConky.

04:40.973 --> 04:42.440
- Yeah!
- Yes!

04:42.465 --> 04:43.475
Let's go, Chief!

04:44.512 --> 04:46.115
No. No.

04:46.140 --> 04:47.211
Tell them, Chief!

04:47.213 --> 04:49.547
Yeah. We're looking forward to this,

04:49.549 --> 04:52.947
and, uh, it's gonna
be a really big thing.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.879
Oh, sir. Can you clear that doorway?

04:56.957 --> 04:58.708
That is an emergency egress.

04:59.034 --> 05:00.034
Thank you.

05:00.961 --> 05:02.294
Well, that'll sell tickets.

05:02.296 --> 05:06.208
Let's all hear it for the
Battle Just Outside Seattle.

05:06.542 --> 05:09.577
- Alright!
- Yeah!

05:13.039 --> 05:15.657
Hey, probie, I got a ton
of grunt work for you to do.

05:15.792 --> 05:18.242
I got a bunch of unwrapped
hose in the garage.

05:18.244 --> 05:19.911
The equipment needs to
be stowed on the shelves,

05:19.913 --> 05:22.464
and the bathrooms need
a once-over, so come on.

05:22.814 --> 05:24.382
- That's a lot of grunting.
- Here.

05:24.384 --> 05:26.451
I got a probie do-list
for you to do, too.

05:26.453 --> 05:28.057
Start by sharpening the axes.

05:28.230 --> 05:29.964
Somebody used them to
break down a side of beef

05:29.990 --> 05:32.134
that somebody bought at
the butcher shop yesterday.

05:34.773 --> 05:35.994
Hey, Granny.

05:35.996 --> 05:37.662
I got these test results from my doctor,

05:37.664 --> 05:39.050
and it can't make heads or tails of it.

05:39.075 --> 05:40.132
Can you help me out here?

05:40.995 --> 05:43.639
Aha. This is why you've
been so sluggish lately.

05:43.791 --> 05:45.025
I don't think I been that...

05:52.679 --> 05:53.745
I don't think I've been that sluggish.

05:53.747 --> 05:55.347
It says here that you got low T.

05:55.349 --> 05:56.815
- Low testosterone?
- Yeah.

05:56.817 --> 05:58.817
You got the levels
of a 13-year-old girl.

05:58.819 --> 05:59.819
Huh.

06:00.099 --> 06:01.806
That's why I've been
watching so much "Riverdale."

06:01.888 --> 06:03.287
I thought it was the dark take

06:03.289 --> 06:04.756
on an otherwise delightful comic book.

06:04.758 --> 06:06.691
Their Jughead doesn't
even wear the crown.

06:06.693 --> 06:08.423
- That part doesn't bother me.
- Yeah, no.

06:08.448 --> 06:10.362
Decline in testosterone happens with age

06:10.364 --> 06:11.629
or unhealthy living.

06:11.631 --> 06:12.964
Huh. What's the fix?

06:12.966 --> 06:14.166
Easy, just take some pills.

06:14.168 --> 06:16.512
You got Testy Boost XL or Pharmasec.

06:16.588 --> 06:17.720
Yeah, right.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.049
Side effects include dry
mouth and hairy knees.

06:21.041 --> 06:22.174
You know, I don't recommend

06:22.176 --> 06:23.441
taking too many pills, though, Chief.

06:23.443 --> 06:24.642
I take a fistful every morning,

06:24.644 --> 06:25.977
and I haven't crapped right in years.

06:25.979 --> 06:27.659
I don't want to jeopardize my craps.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.466
Those are my three
favorite times of the day.

06:29.491 --> 06:30.741
There are other ways, though.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.603
In fact, there's a great article
in this month's "Chiseled AF,"

06:33.787 --> 06:35.899
"Natural Remedies for
Everyday Maladies."

06:36.256 --> 06:37.989
You know, can get your
testosterone levels up

06:37.991 --> 06:40.192
just by doing more
male-based activities.

06:40.194 --> 06:42.194
For instance, you could
get your T levels up

06:42.196 --> 06:43.395
just by eating more steak.

06:43.397 --> 06:44.596
Hmm. I like steak.

06:44.598 --> 06:46.130
That's... that's not how it works.

06:46.132 --> 06:47.199
Let me ask you a question.

06:47.201 --> 06:48.667
You find yourself doing
an overwhelming amount

06:48.669 --> 06:50.134
of female activities?

06:50.136 --> 06:51.603
I do. I'm surrounded by women.

06:51.605 --> 06:53.137
I have a wife and three daughters.

06:53.139 --> 06:54.739
They make me piss sitting down.

06:54.741 --> 06:56.074
They made me buy a cat.

06:56.076 --> 06:57.342
They made me watch "The Voice."

06:57.344 --> 06:59.378
- I do all those.
- Unbelievable.

07:00.992 --> 07:02.648
- Eh.
- Oh.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.006
Ah, man. That's pathetic.

07:04.031 --> 07:05.496
- Way off!
- Yikes.

07:05.876 --> 07:06.885
Help me out here, guys.

07:06.887 --> 07:07.934
For the sake of your health,

07:07.959 --> 07:10.484
you need 200cc of steak, stat.

07:10.509 --> 07:11.691
Eat steak.

07:11.958 --> 07:13.157
I can get onboard with that.

07:13.159 --> 07:14.559
Sure, because you never need to base

07:14.561 --> 07:16.160
your medical decisions on science.

07:16.162 --> 07:17.695
Right. Science is for nerds.

07:17.697 --> 07:19.431
I hate nerds.

07:19.433 --> 07:20.433
Carry on.

07:21.301 --> 07:22.767
Hey, if it's like the
middle of the night, though,

07:22.769 --> 07:24.521
you guys do sit down, right?

07:24.863 --> 07:25.863
What?

07:28.413 --> 07:30.221
This is gonna be our
year. I'm telling you.

07:30.246 --> 07:31.395
Ooh, ah!

07:33.107 --> 07:35.041
You guys know the best
way to train for a fight

07:35.066 --> 07:36.272
is lifting heavy crap.

07:36.463 --> 07:37.529
You guys want in on this?

07:37.628 --> 07:39.726
Ha! Try again, Tom Sawyer.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.779
You trying to trick us
into doing your grunt work.

07:41.922 --> 07:44.248
I'm trying to give you
guys the competitive edge.

07:44.273 --> 07:45.939
You guys lost to the cops last year.

07:45.964 --> 07:47.132
- Didn't that suck?
- Yeah.

07:47.157 --> 07:48.793
Yeah. That was pretty shitty, I guess.

07:48.795 --> 07:50.528
This is the year you get revenge.

07:50.530 --> 07:53.642
I mean, how did Rocky Balboa
beat Ivan Drago in "Rocky IV"?

07:53.667 --> 07:55.333
He was more American.

07:55.335 --> 07:58.470
Chopping wood, lifting rocks
in a barn, those were chores.

07:58.472 --> 08:00.404
Rocky was just doing Mickey's chores.

08:00.406 --> 08:02.140
Mickey wasn't in "Rocky
IV." He was dead by then.

08:02.142 --> 08:04.208
Yeah, Lucy. "You're a bum!"

08:04.210 --> 08:05.877
It's more like, "You're a bum,

08:05.879 --> 08:07.145
and you'll never amount to nothing."

08:07.147 --> 08:08.555
He kind of sounds more drunk like,

08:08.580 --> 08:11.060
"You're a bum, Lucy. I
found you in the Dumpster."

08:11.085 --> 08:12.099
Eh, no. That sucks. It's more

08:12.124 --> 08:14.411
this, "You're a bum, I tells you."

08:14.436 --> 08:15.609
No. Need more spittle.

08:15.634 --> 08:17.689
"You're a stinking bum, Rocky.

08:17.691 --> 08:19.867
I'll never train a
stinking bum like you."

08:19.892 --> 08:20.975
- Oh. There it is.
- Yeah.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.976
One of you guys is a dead man.

08:23.001 --> 08:24.002
So dead.

08:24.027 --> 08:25.852
You guys ever enter a room
without storming in angrily?

08:25.877 --> 08:27.008
I want to know which one of your guys

08:27.033 --> 08:28.700
is sending dick pics to my wife.

08:28.702 --> 08:30.347
Why do you think it was
one of my guys, Jerry?

08:30.372 --> 08:32.533
Because he's wearing blue pants, Terry.

08:32.558 --> 08:34.265
- That could be any uniform.
- Oh, really?

08:34.289 --> 08:36.044
Take a look. What do you see?

08:36.070 --> 08:37.535
Hmm, a penis.

08:37.561 --> 08:38.910
Behind the penis.

08:38.936 --> 08:41.255
- Uh, scrotum.
- Behind the scrotum.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.479
How do you enlarge this thing?

08:42.679 --> 08:43.813
Right there.

08:43.839 --> 08:45.293
Huh? What do you see?

08:45.478 --> 08:48.451
That's a locker with
a Tacoma FD turnout.

08:48.476 --> 08:49.817
I mean, I still see scrotum.

08:49.923 --> 08:52.485
Trust me. I know it's not Andy.

08:52.510 --> 08:54.417
Let me just narrow this
down for you, Jerry.

08:54.442 --> 08:56.116
The mystery member belongs to me.

08:56.141 --> 08:57.572
- You son of a bitch.
- No, no!

08:57.597 --> 08:58.663

don't let the chief have any.

17:21.673 --> 17:23.194
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Chiefy.

17:23.220 --> 17:25.625
I got something for you... whale haunch.

17:25.883 --> 17:27.744
King Krakatoa used to
give this to his warriors

17:27.770 --> 17:29.570
before they ripped the
heads of their enemies

17:29.595 --> 17:31.368
- with their bare hands.
- This will make me manly?

17:31.393 --> 17:33.259
That'll spike your T
right through your skull.

17:33.284 --> 17:34.483
I guess at this point,
anything helps, right?

17:34.508 --> 17:36.108
- That's right.
- Alright.

17:36.133 --> 17:37.358
- Yeah.
- Bombs away.

17:37.383 --> 17:38.932
Do it. Oh, yeah. Chug it. Look at that.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.456
You're becoming one with the ocean.

17:40.481 --> 17:42.280
- Ouf.
- Oh, yeah.

17:42.552 --> 17:43.968
- Yeah!
- That's manly.

17:43.993 --> 17:45.050
Whale haunch!

17:45.075 --> 17:47.862
- Whoa!
- Hey.

17:47.887 --> 17:50.220
This little guy survived
as my streak continues.

17:50.245 --> 17:51.444
Hey, hey. Good luck in that match

17:51.469 --> 17:53.469
tomorrow, man, although I know

17:53.494 --> 17:55.701
you don't need it, right,
because you're Eddie...

17:55.726 --> 17:57.560
Penisi!

18:00.740 --> 18:04.219
Aaaah!

18:04.244 --> 18:05.307
Aah!

18:15.388 --> 18:18.313
Ladies and gentlemen of Tacoma,

18:18.338 --> 18:21.740
let's get prepared to pummel.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.905
Alright, guys. Remember,
just go to the moves.

18:26.930 --> 18:29.303
Mop the floor. Scrub
the toilet. Roll the hose.

18:29.328 --> 18:30.578
They are not gonna know what hit them.

18:30.603 --> 18:31.670
Yes, Sensei!

18:38.111 --> 18:41.699
Come on, Granny. Roll the hose.

18:41.724 --> 18:43.296
- Roll the hose.
- Roll the hose.

18:43.321 --> 18:44.454
- Roll the hose.
- Yeah!

18:45.368 --> 18:46.368
Ouf!

18:48.358 --> 18:49.851
Oops.

18:49.876 --> 18:51.073
Alright, Ike. You got this.

18:52.034 --> 18:53.742
- Tubbs! Tubbs!
- Come on, buddy.

18:53.767 --> 18:55.219
Just like we practiced, big guy.

18:55.244 --> 18:56.905
Mop the floor! Mop the floor!

18:56.930 --> 18:59.247
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

19:01.178 --> 19:02.178
Okay.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.396
Oh!

19:09.668 --> 19:10.992
Let's do this, Pikachu.

19:11.354 --> 19:13.811
My head says no, but my libido says yes.

19:13.836 --> 19:15.875
Doesn't he have that thing
where he likes to get hit by her?

19:15.900 --> 19:17.353
Yeah. It's called a fetish.

19:18.137 --> 19:20.704
Scrub the toilet! Scrub the toilet!

19:22.195 --> 19:23.491
I'm sorry, Andy.

19:23.516 --> 19:24.888
Ah, don't worry about it.

19:25.380 --> 19:26.921
Either way, I come out a winner.

19:26.946 --> 19:28.040
You need help, man.

19:34.486 --> 19:37.343
Come on, man. Turn around and fight.

19:38.105 --> 19:39.335
Ugh!

19:40.081 --> 19:41.499
It's hard to feel good about that.

19:43.587 --> 19:45.091
- You don't need to do it.
- Let me do it.

19:45.116 --> 19:46.766
Ow, ow, ow, ow, stop. Stop. Stop.

19:46.791 --> 19:47.807
Okay. Okay. Okay.

19:47.832 --> 19:49.373
Hey, boys. Check it out.

19:49.854 --> 19:51.231
Am I right? Like a king.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.589
Dude, you look like Gandalf.

19:52.614 --> 19:54.329
It's a little long,
but check this out...

19:54.354 --> 19:55.361
rhinestones.

19:55.386 --> 19:57.317
- "Penisi Street."
- Too much?

19:57.342 --> 19:59.007
- I paid extra.
- Worth every penny.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.329
You kidding me, Cap? Looks great.

20:00.354 --> 20:01.440
It's nice, right? It pops.

20:01.465 --> 20:02.775
You know what? Let's make dinner plans.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.451
This thing is gonna
be over in 10 minutes.

20:04.476 --> 20:06.478
- Granny, lace them up.
- Okay.

20:06.631 --> 20:08.073
Oh, hey, Ikey, will you
read that text to me?

20:08.098 --> 20:09.146
Sure, Cap.

20:09.171 --> 20:11.395
It's not so much a
text as it is a picture

20:11.420 --> 20:13.397
- of the female genitalia.
- Nice. Okay.

20:13.422 --> 20:15.025
Text back, "I likes it,"

20:15.050 --> 20:16.876
with the emoji of your choice.

20:16.901 --> 20:18.982
You sure, Cap? I mean,
it's really graphic.

20:19.253 --> 20:20.276
I'm getting laced up.

20:20.301 --> 20:21.901
I'm about to save the
honor of the station.

20:22.002 --> 20:23.740
Do me a solid. Text back.

20:23.970 --> 20:24.996
You choose the emoji.

20:25.419 --> 20:26.887
Of course. Alright. Yeah. Sure.

20:27.921 --> 20:28.987
"I likes it." Yeah. Pretzel emoji.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.409
- Pretzel?
- What, you don't like pretzels?

20:33.644 --> 20:34.910
Hi, sweetie.

20:34.935 --> 20:36.534
I came to watch you kick his ass.

20:36.559 --> 20:38.260
Hey, Lola. How you doing?

20:38.833 --> 20:40.366
We were just sexting you.

20:41.072 --> 20:42.715
You have a wonderful
tramp stamp by the way.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.232
I don't have a tramp stamp.

20:44.257 --> 20:45.923
- That'll be all, Ike.
- Is that you?

20:47.141 --> 20:48.202
You've been cheating on me?

20:48.227 --> 20:50.370
Did we establish exclusivity?

20:50.395 --> 20:51.434
You asshole.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.294
Oh! Oh! Oh!

20:53.319 --> 20:54.566
Wow!

20:54.591 --> 20:57.108
I'll rip your head off
your scrawny little body.

20:57.133 --> 20:59.154
- Sleep with one eye open, you prick.
- Get her out of here.

20:59.512 --> 21:00.829
I'm gonna get you.

21:00.854 --> 21:01.957
Okay. Take it easy.

21:01.982 --> 21:03.131
What the hell happened in here?

21:03.156 --> 21:04.481
Oh, my ankle.

21:04.506 --> 21:05.572
Ahh.

21:06.442 --> 21:07.957
Your last name has penis in it.

21:08.116 --> 21:09.308
Anyone else notice that?

21:09.410 --> 21:11.588
Oh, yeah. This ankle is broken.

21:11.724 --> 21:13.083
I'm gonna have to pull
him from the fight.

21:13.108 --> 21:15.086
I guess it's Polonsky's lucky day.

21:15.111 --> 21:16.644
- Oh, it's his lucky day?
- Somebody go tell him.

21:16.669 --> 21:18.098
He just got a reprieve
from the governor.

21:18.123 --> 21:20.178
He's faking. Pussy!

21:20.203 --> 21:22.003
Well, he's still gonna kick your ass.

21:22.028 --> 21:23.095
In, like, 6 to 8 weeks.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.405
Yeah. Yeah. You hear
that? Mark your calendar.

21:25.430 --> 21:28.564
Oh, you're having your sister
do your fighting for you now.

21:28.589 --> 21:30.434
Oh! Don't talk about my wife like that.

21:30.514 --> 21:32.230
I'll fight you myself, you assclown.

21:32.255 --> 21:33.556
Bring it on, fat boy.

21:33.581 --> 21:35.181
I don't care who it is at this point.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.496
Let's do this, ginger.

21:36.521 --> 21:39.251
Ginger?! Oh! It's on!

21:40.176 --> 21:41.372
Terry, you sure about this?

21:41.397 --> 21:42.730
Yeah. I'm sure about this.

21:43.107 --> 21:44.218
Ah!

21:44.488 --> 21:47.379
Uh, what in God's name is that?

21:47.404 --> 21:49.555
- You'll see.
- Mm!

21:50.359 --> 21:52.693
Whale haunch, makes a man strong.

21:52.718 --> 21:54.054
Chief, you haven't even trained.

21:54.079 --> 21:55.484

Sure.

- You up for this, Chief?
- Yeah.

22:31.412 --> 22:33.039
I've been taking whale haunch.

22:33.064 --> 22:35.183
- Where'd you get that from?
- Eddie gave it to me.

22:35.208 --> 22:37.018
- Where'd you get that from?
- From your mom.

22:37.043 --> 22:38.720
Oh, that stuff is bullshit.

22:38.745 --> 22:41.011
It's just coconut water
and vanilla extract.

22:41.036 --> 22:43.837
She tell you a whole story
about King Kalapanaki?

22:43.862 --> 22:44.871
Yeah. It's a great story.

22:44.896 --> 22:46.063
No. It's all fake.

22:46.354 --> 22:48.754
God, she makes so much money
preying off white people's

22:48.779 --> 22:50.923
condescending beliefs
in third-world cultures.

22:50.948 --> 22:53.498
Shrewd. She is so full
of ancient-island wisdom.

22:53.523 --> 22:54.697
She try to sell you a gremlin?

22:54.722 --> 22:56.975
- She sold me a gremlin.
- No. It's a flying squirrel.

22:57.102 --> 22:58.190
So wait. It's not real?

22:58.215 --> 22:59.280
Mnh-mnh.

22:59.305 --> 23:00.483
Oh, shit.

23:16.534 --> 23:18.434
Ahh.

23:27.210 --> 23:28.398
What'd the doctor say?

23:28.423 --> 23:29.614
He said I have contusions,

23:29.639 --> 23:31.773
lacerations and a little
bit of brain damage.

23:31.798 --> 23:33.460
He says I'm lucky I
still know how to breathe.

23:34.501 --> 23:37.289
Oh, but that beating did
somehow raise my T levels,

23:37.314 --> 23:39.538
so, Granny, I did it the natural way.

23:40.045 --> 23:42.111
- Hey.
- You're an inspiration.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.241
Whoo!

23:44.266 --> 23:45.895
What an unforgettable night, huh, guys?

23:45.920 --> 23:46.920
Oh, yeah. Let me guess.

23:46.945 --> 23:49.096
On the way to the hospital,
you boned the ambulance driver.

23:49.121 --> 23:50.121
Close.

23:50.146 --> 23:52.296
You got to the hospital, and
you boned the E.R. doctor.

23:52.321 --> 23:53.823
No. I made sweet love

23:53.848 --> 23:55.960
to the lady that rented me this scooter.

23:55.985 --> 23:57.127
Son of a bitch.

23:57.152 --> 23:58.218
And after the lovemaking,

23:58.243 --> 24:00.092
I found a buffalo nickel
in the parking lot.

24:00.117 --> 24:01.331
How do you do it, huh, Cap?

24:01.484 --> 24:03.283
How does everything keep
coming up roses for you?
