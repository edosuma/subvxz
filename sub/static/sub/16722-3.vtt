00:21.608 --> 00:23.726
Gene, what are you doing?

00:23.727 --> 00:25.461
Tanning! It's the middle
of summer

00:25.462 --> 00:27.063
and I look like a British lady.

00:27.064 --> 00:29.065
Hey, slow it down,
George Hamilton.

00:29.066 --> 00:30.549
You want to look
like an Oompa Loompa?

00:30.584 --> 00:33.019
Gene, if you want a tan,
why don't you go out in

00:33.020 --> 00:35.187
the burger suit for a while
and hand out samples?

00:35.188 --> 00:36.806
No way. I don't
want burger lines.

00:36.807 --> 00:38.307
Package for Bob Belcher.

00:38.308 --> 00:39.976
Dad, that's you!
Thanks, Gene.

00:40.010 --> 00:43.613
A mystery package!
What could it be?

00:43.614 --> 00:45.815
Huh, the return address
is my dad's old restaurant.

00:45.849 --> 00:47.950
That's weird.
There's a note.

00:47.985 --> 00:50.736
It's from those ladies
who bought your dad's place.

00:50.771 --> 00:52.171
"Dear Bob,
the workmen found this box

00:52.172 --> 00:53.939
"when they were redoing
the air vents.

00:53.940 --> 00:55.274
"We were afraid it had
vibrators in it.

00:55.275 --> 00:57.009
Boy, were we relieved."

00:57.044 --> 00:59.779
If you think about it, any box
could have vibrators in it.

00:59.780 --> 01:01.614
Oh, my God, it's my toys!

01:01.615 --> 01:03.816
Wow, I haven't seen these
since I was just a kid.

01:03.817 --> 01:05.601
I used to hide it
from my dad

01:05.602 --> 01:07.603
because he didn't want me
to have toys during work hours.

01:07.638 --> 01:09.138
Joke's on you, Dad.

01:09.139 --> 01:11.107
Someone filled your
toy box with trash.

01:11.108 --> 01:12.341
What? No.

01:12.376 --> 01:13.743
This is my friend Brilly.

01:13.777 --> 01:15.011
A scouring pad?

01:15.045 --> 01:16.879
A scouring <i>pal.</i>

01:16.880 --> 01:18.781
And my World War II
fighter plane.

01:18.815 --> 01:20.783
And my dog, Mr. Doglavich.

01:20.817 --> 01:22.785
That's soap.
Yeah, but see?

01:22.819 --> 01:25.021
It's sort of shaped
like a dog. Mm...

01:25.055 --> 01:27.289
What is this feeling
I'm feeling right now?

01:27.290 --> 01:30.493
It's like I'm sad
for another person?

01:30.494 --> 01:32.712
Is that a thing?
Am I going crazy?!

01:32.713 --> 01:34.814
Look, times were different
when I was growing up.

01:34.815 --> 01:36.382
We had to make our own fun.

01:36.383 --> 01:37.750
Here, try these.
You'll see.

01:37.751 --> 01:39.418
Ow.
See?

01:39.419 --> 01:42.521
Now I get it.
If anything, this is <i>too</i> fun.

01:42.522 --> 01:43.989
I want to pet the dog!

01:43.990 --> 01:45.408
No, Mr. Doglavich!

01:45.409 --> 01:47.543
Sorry, Dad.
He's dead.

01:47.577 --> 01:48.844
You could take him
to the soap vet.

01:48.845 --> 01:50.196
No, I can't, Tina!

01:50.197 --> 01:52.665
We're going to bury him
out back.

01:52.666 --> 01:53.733
Everybody get your coats.

01:53.734 --> 01:55.067
Bob, stop it now.

01:55.068 --> 01:56.402
No!
It's summer!

01:56.403 --> 01:57.910
That's my dog!
He's dead!

01:57.921 --> 01:59.321
Go take a time-out.

01:59.322 --> 02:00.690
I'm gonna write
a eulogy.

02:00.691 --> 02:03.392
I knew you so briefly,
you dead soap dog.

02:03.393 --> 02:05.895
Oh!
I think I can fix him.

02:09.416 --> 02:12.284
There you go, good as new.

02:12.285 --> 02:13.919
Who's a good boy?

02:13.920 --> 02:16.222
Woof-woof!

02:16.223 --> 02:18.023
Fetch, Mr. Doglavich.

02:18.024 --> 02:19.925
Get back to work, Bob.

02:19.926 --> 02:21.360
Die!

02:21.361 --> 02:23.295
Get back to work, Bob.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.457 --> 02:35.157
Get back to work,
Bobby.

02:35.192 --> 02:37.059
Oh, my God.

02:38.195 --> 02:39.562
Lin, I just
realized something.

02:39.563 --> 02:40.963
I had a bad childhood.

02:40.964 --> 02:43.032
Yeah, I know.
What do you mean you know?

02:43.033 --> 02:44.900
Look at you.
What do you mean, look at me?

02:44.935 --> 02:47.303
Look at how you stand.
People who had

02:47.304 --> 02:48.704
good childhoods
don't stand like that.

02:48.739 --> 02:50.773
I thought I remembered having
fun working at my dad's place,

02:50.774 --> 02:51.907
but I was just working...

02:51.942 --> 02:53.409
all the time.

02:53.410 --> 02:54.910
And snuggling with steel wool.

02:54.911 --> 02:56.912
And petting a piece of soap.

02:56.913 --> 02:58.781
I guess talking about it helps.

03:11.928 --> 03:14.296
Kids, get back to work.
Get back to work...

03:14.297 --> 03:16.832
Oh, my God! Linda!

03:16.833 --> 03:19.335
Kids, your mother and I
have an announcement.

03:19.336 --> 03:20.736
Buh, buh-buh-buh,
buh-baa!

03:20.771 --> 03:22.271
You're having
another baby?

03:22.272 --> 03:23.773
At your age?!
Sick!

03:23.774 --> 03:25.057
I knew
I spotted a bump.

03:25.091 --> 03:27.026
What?! No, I'm gassy.

03:27.027 --> 03:29.428
No, guys.
Okay, here it goes.

03:29.429 --> 03:31.897
Kids...

03:31.932 --> 03:33.833
you're fired.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.752
Buh, buh-buh-ba!

03:39.441 --> 03:41.008
Ex-squeeze me?

03:41.042 --> 03:42.409
You're all fired.

03:42.444 --> 03:44.545
I deserve this.
I've been coasting.

03:44.579 --> 03:47.181
This isn't punishment,
it's, it's a gift.

03:47.182 --> 03:48.882
My dad made me work
all the time.

03:48.883 --> 03:50.751
And that box of toys...
Horrible toys.

03:50.752 --> 03:52.519
Yes, horrible toys,
made me realize

03:52.520 --> 03:54.154
that I never had any fun.

03:54.189 --> 03:56.723
So, I want you to go out
and have the summer

03:56.724 --> 03:58.258
and the childhood
that I never had.

03:58.293 --> 04:00.461
So go out! Go outside!

04:00.462 --> 04:01.762
Go be children!

04:01.796 --> 04:03.780
But what are
we supposed to do?

04:03.781 --> 04:04.948
Have a water balloon fight.

04:04.949 --> 04:06.416
Play in a vacant lot.
Ride bikes.

04:06.417 --> 04:08.485
I'm more of an
indoor boy.

04:08.486 --> 04:11.288
I can't defend myself,
I've been declawed. Gene...

04:11.322 --> 04:13.157
All right, well, I guess
we're gonna take off.

04:13.158 --> 04:15.792
Arrivedercis.
Bye, Mom and Dad.

04:15.793 --> 04:17.161
Keep in touch.
Don't change.

04:17.161 --> 04:18.562
See you in the fall.

04:18.563 --> 04:20.197
Tina, you can come
home at night.

04:20.231 --> 04:22.833
Ah, phew.

04:22.834 --> 04:25.235
I'm glad you kids store
your bikes in my garage.

04:25.236 --> 04:26.737
It's fun for me.
Sometimes I pretend

04:26.738 --> 04:28.172
I have three
kids of my own

04:28.173 --> 04:29.406
and these are
their bikes.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.741
Which kid is your favorite?

04:30.742 --> 04:32.142
Jeremy.
He needs me the most.

04:32.143 --> 04:34.144
The twins have each other.
Whoa.

04:34.145 --> 04:36.013
Sometimes I come in here
just so I can trip over 'em.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.948
I'll be, like,

04:37.949 --> 04:39.583
"The kids left
their bikes here again."

04:39.584 --> 04:41.351
All right!
Summer fun starts now!

04:43.688 --> 04:44.755
Oh.

04:44.756 --> 04:47.474
â™ª Fun, fun... fun-fun

04:50.278 --> 04:52.613
â™ª Fun, fun... fun-fun

04:55.934 --> 04:58.435
â™ª Fun-fun-fun,
fun-fun-fun â™ª

04:58.436 --> 05:02.823
â™ª Fun-fun-fun, fun-fun-fun,
fun-fun-fun! â™ª

05:02.824 --> 05:05.008
Ah! Diapers!

05:05.009 --> 05:07.761
So, how would you
feel about, um...

05:07.762 --> 05:08.762
how do I say this?...

05:08.796 --> 05:10.631
uh, deferred payments?

05:10.632 --> 05:12.599
I wouldn't pay
you now, but...

05:12.600 --> 05:15.035
eventually I would,
in the future.

05:15.036 --> 05:17.170
What I'm gonna ask you
isn't totally legal.

05:17.205 --> 05:19.206
It's not a sex thing,
though, so...

05:22.477 --> 05:25.012
Okay, I guess I'll keep these
resumés on file.

05:25.013 --> 05:26.897
Maybe we can get
an unpaid intern.

05:26.898 --> 05:29.316
Ooh, they could
do coffee runs!

05:29.350 --> 05:30.617
Lin, we have coffee here.

05:30.618 --> 05:31.617
I don't care.

05:31.619 --> 05:33.520
No one's ever gotten me coffee!

05:33.521 --> 05:35.672
- Everybody on the floor!
- This is a stickup!

05:35.707 --> 05:39.176
Mickey! Ah,
you're out of the slammer.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.645
Bob, Linda. bring it in. Aw...

05:41.646 --> 05:42.980
Hey...

05:42.981 --> 05:44.381
how's my favorite
hostage?

05:44.382 --> 05:45.649
I thought you got
eight years.

05:45.650 --> 05:47.317
You didn't escape,
did you?

05:47.318 --> 05:49.052
It turned out
the prosecutor was on meth

05:49.053 --> 05:50.387
for the entire trial!

05:50.421 --> 05:52.239
And he drove his car
into a peacock sanctuary.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.557
Now he's in jail
and I'm out!

05:53.558 --> 05:55.025
Oh, good for you.

05:55.026 --> 05:56.994
I'll get you a beer
A beer'd be nice.

05:56.995 --> 05:58.829
Hey, where are those
whippersnappers of yours, huh?

05:58.830 --> 06:00.430
Uh, I fired them.
What? No!

06:00.431 --> 06:01.698
That sounds harsh.

06:01.699 --> 06:03.367
We laid them off
to go enjoy themselves.

06:03.368 --> 06:05.035
Ah, yeah, sure,
breaking windows,

06:05.036 --> 06:06.536
lightin' fires, huffin' paint,

06:06.537 --> 06:07.571
Um...
sniffin' glue,

06:07.605 --> 06:09.373
blowin' up houses,

06:09.374 --> 06:12.042
settin' rats in a bottle and
throwin' 'em down a river and...

06:12.043 --> 06:13.076
No, none of those things.

06:13.077 --> 06:14.278
So, what's next for you,
Mickey?

06:14.279 --> 06:15.379
What're you gonna do?

06:15.380 --> 06:16.847
Goin' straight, Bob!

06:16.848 --> 06:19.349
Gonna get a job.
Find myself a gal.

06:19.350 --> 06:21.184
Or... I don't know what
people do nowadays.

06:21.185 --> 06:22.686
Build a-a barn maybe.

06:22.687 --> 06:24.388
Um... Paint the barn with the gal.

06:24.389 --> 06:26.089
Put the gal in
the barn and...

06:26.090 --> 06:27.724
Yeah, maybe.

06:27.725 --> 06:29.459
You know, American dream.
Gal and a barn.

06:29.460 --> 06:30.894
Yeah.
Hey, Bobby, psst.

06:30.895 --> 06:32.696
What psst?
We can both hear you, Lin.

06:32.697 --> 06:36.283
What about ickey-May
for the ob-jay?

06:36.284 --> 06:38.218
I'm pretty sure he can
understand you, Lin.

06:38.252 --> 06:39.419
What language is that?

06:39.454 --> 06:41.622
Oh. Uh... wow.

06:41.623 --> 06:43.557
Well, Mickey, if you're serious
about finding a job,

06:43.558 --> 06:45.258
we-we need someone
for the summer. Oh.

06:45.259 --> 06:47.160
We can't pay you
that much, honey.

06:47.195 --> 06:49.096
Not even what we're
legally supposed to.

06:49.130 --> 06:51.598
I'd work for meals
and a cot in the basement.

06:51.633 --> 06:54.534
Um... I guess you could sleep
in the basement.

06:54.535 --> 06:56.870
Oh, yay! Oh, I love it!

06:56.871 --> 06:58.772
We got the team back
together again, huh?

06:58.773 --> 07:00.073
Oh!

07:00.074 --> 07:02.476
The three amagos.
Olé!

07:02.477 --> 07:04.461
Ugh! Summer is awful.

07:04.495 --> 07:06.063
There's too much pressure
to enjoy yourself.

07:06.064 --> 07:08.131
It's like New Year's Eve
for kids.

07:08.132 --> 07:09.733
We should probably go
by the restaurant.

07:09.734 --> 07:12.516
I bet that place is
falling apart without us by now.

07:14.272 --> 07:16.423
Well, we've sown our wild oats.

07:16.424 --> 07:18.225
Things got crazy!

07:18.226 --> 07:21.144
Anyways, no need to grovel, Dad.
We're back.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.063
We all said things
we didn't mean.

07:23.064 --> 07:25.949
"You're fired."
You did not mean that.

07:25.950 --> 07:28.335
It sounded very insincere
as I remember,

07:28.336 --> 07:30.303
and I thought, "No."

07:31.506 --> 07:32.806
Oh, my God,
is someone here?

07:32.840 --> 07:34.741
Um...
Uh...

07:34.742 --> 07:35.976
Hey, baby Bobs!

07:37.445 --> 07:38.979
Kids, you remember Mickey.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.514
You fired us
for a bank robber?

07:40.515 --> 07:42.416
Hey!

07:42.450 --> 07:45.419
Look, Mickey, we're back now,
so you can turn in your apron.

07:45.420 --> 07:46.620
Louise, no.

07:46.621 --> 07:48.689
You guys are just our
kids now, not our employees.

07:48.690 --> 07:50.457
Is that all we are
to you, Dad?

07:50.458 --> 07:51.425
Your children?!

07:51.426 --> 07:53.660
Yes, and I want you
to go have fun.

07:53.661 --> 07:54.878
Never!

07:54.879 --> 07:56.546
Stop fighting it
and give it a chance!

07:56.547 --> 07:57.814
You can't
make us leave.

08:00.868 --> 08:04.171
Hell no, I won't go!
Hell no, I won't go!

08:04.205 --> 08:06.540
Uh! why are you guys
stronger than me?

08:06.541 --> 08:08.508
Pilates!

08:08.543 --> 08:10.277
This is for
your own good!

08:10.278 --> 08:12.863
Fine! We'll ride our bikes.

08:12.864 --> 08:14.698
Oh, yeah, we'll
ride 'em so far

08:14.699 --> 08:16.199
you'll never see us again!

08:16.200 --> 08:18.118
Okay, bye, kids.
Have fun.

08:18.119 --> 08:19.653
Bye, Mom.

08:22.023 --> 08:24.074
Guys, I think we're lost.

08:24.075 --> 08:25.525
I know.

08:25.526 --> 08:27.644
And all this breathing
is making me hungry.

08:27.662 --> 08:30.530
Blueberry bushes!
We're saved!

08:30.531 --> 08:32.315
Is this a farm?
I thought those were extinct.

08:32.332 --> 08:33.850
We can't just eat these berries.

08:33.851 --> 08:35.318
They probably belong to someone.

08:35.352 --> 08:37.020
If you don't want people
to eat your fruit,

08:37.020 --> 08:38.221
grow it inside a safe.

08:38.222 --> 08:39.856
I don't know how
animals do it.

08:39.857 --> 08:41.691
Fruit is just bad,
and they know it.

08:45.930 --> 08:46.713
Hello, children!

08:46.714 --> 08:47.997
Farmers!

08:47.998 --> 08:49.666
How did those get in there?

08:49.667 --> 08:51.351
Don't worry, we've got
plenty of berries.

08:51.352 --> 08:52.753
Eat as many as you want.

08:52.754 --> 08:54.354
Or if you'd rather have
sandwiches,

08:54.355 --> 08:55.856
we have plenty
at the house.

08:55.857 --> 08:57.057
And lizards.

08:57.091 --> 08:58.525
I'll eat both.

08:58.526 --> 09:01.745
<i>...and then I woke up nude
on horseback</i>

09:01.779 --> 09:03.914
in the forest,
and there she was,

09:03.948 --> 09:05.282
my Beverly.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.583
I had wandered away

09:06.584 --> 09:08.518
from a community birthing
in a barn nearby.

09:08.519 --> 09:11.455
She looked like a faerie queene
pooping under a tree.

09:11.456 --> 09:17.093
â™ª A faerie queene
pooping under a tree. â™ª

09:17.094 --> 09:19.029
30 years and five kids later,
and we're still doing it.

09:19.030 --> 09:21.231
Ew...

09:21.232 --> 09:22.799
Well, we've got
an empty nest now,

09:22.800 --> 09:24.100
but we still
have our farm.

09:24.135 --> 09:25.569
Our dad has a restaurant.

09:25.570 --> 09:27.537
We used to work there,
but he fired us.

09:27.538 --> 09:28.939
Oh, now, that's a shame.

09:28.940 --> 09:30.540
We always let our kids
work here.

09:30.541 --> 09:33.376
Beverly, I have
a crazy idea.

09:33.377 --> 09:37.280
â™ª They could work here...

09:37.281 --> 09:38.548
â™ª Work here.

09:38.549 --> 09:40.083
We couldn't afford
to pay you much.

09:40.084 --> 09:42.252
Just, say, ten dollars a day.

09:42.253 --> 09:43.487
Ten dollars?!

09:43.488 --> 09:45.589
I could start saving
for my Porsche Cayenne.

09:45.590 --> 09:47.090
But Dad doesn't want us
to work.

09:47.091 --> 09:48.625
Dad doesn't have to know.

09:48.626 --> 09:51.394
Are we gonna send him a letter?
You gonna call him up? No.

09:51.395 --> 09:54.264
You gonna find a phone and call
Dad and tell him stuff? No.

09:54.265 --> 09:56.833
Seems like Dad told us to just
make our way, didn't he?

09:56.834 --> 09:59.102
Well, I guess I don't want
any gaps in my resumé.

09:59.103 --> 10:00.437
That's right.
You don't.

10:00.438 --> 10:02.405
Good, because we've got
a lot you could do.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.641
Yes, they could pick
the weed... s.

10:04.642 --> 10:06.309
Great idea, Bev.

10:06.310 --> 10:08.812
We have a terrible
weed problem.

10:22.844 --> 10:24.900
I don't get it!

10:30.564 --> 10:32.699
Morning, kids!
Can I get you anything?

10:32.700 --> 10:35.101
I'll just have
your coffee.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.336
Give it back.
I'll just have a sip.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.204
Louise! No time, Louise.
We're late.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.072
Late for what?

10:39.073 --> 10:40.373
Late to... for our...

10:40.374 --> 10:42.559
What
would we be late for?

10:42.560 --> 10:45.028
It's not like we have
jobs or anything.

10:45.029 --> 10:46.663
'Cause we're late
for the pier.

10:46.664 --> 10:48.398
Yeah, we gotta go
to the pier.

10:48.399 --> 10:49.699
Yeah, the pier.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.434
To do our pier,
our rock stuff.

10:51.435 --> 10:52.836
What's rock stuff?

10:52.837 --> 10:53.703
What do you mean...?

10:53.704 --> 10:55.121
Oh, droppin' rocks...
Yeah.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.355
...in the water.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.323
Sounds fun.

10:57.358 --> 10:59.559
Yeah. Yeah. I can disorient a fish.

10:59.593 --> 11:00.860
Nice.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.295
Well, as long as
you kids are having fun.

11:02.296 --> 11:03.563
Oh, yeah.
Ah.

11:03.564 --> 11:04.864
Summer rocks
are the best rocks.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.099
Boy, we should go.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.085
Well, drop one for me.

11:09.587 --> 11:11.471
I want your nuggets!

11:16.010 --> 11:17.677
You two little critters
will be our pickers.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.212
Now come with me.

11:19.213 --> 11:20.997
Gene has tons of experience
picking his nose.

11:20.998 --> 11:22.515
And my butt.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.285
Tina, you'll be our
blueberry delivery girl.

11:25.286 --> 11:27.320
Just remember, if
you get jammed up,

11:27.321 --> 11:29.155
you don't know my name and you
don't know where this farm is.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.724
I don't know where this farm is.
Exactly.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.229
Ta-da!

11:36.230 --> 11:37.597
Wow, Mickey, you handed out

11:37.598 --> 11:39.165
the whole tray
of samples already?

11:39.166 --> 11:40.600
Sure did, Bob.

11:40.601 --> 11:42.235
And, ah, you don't mind
the burger suit?

11:42.236 --> 11:43.469
I love it.
I love it.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.838
I know who I am in this.

11:44.839 --> 11:46.272
I'm the burger.
Right.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.774
Sorry, it's a little tight.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.642
But, yeah. It is.
It's incredibly snug.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.177
It looks fine.
It's good.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.012
I'm gonna need your help
taking this off, I think.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.447
If that's all right?
Oh, uh, yeah, sure.

11:54.448 --> 11:55.815
I'll, uh, try
and pull the...

11:55.816 --> 11:57.283
No, you see, there's
snaps in the crotch

11:57.284 --> 11:58.985
that my arms aren't long
enough to get down to.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.620
If you could just...
this and that.

12:00.621 --> 12:02.455
Yeah, I don't want to
touch down there, so...

12:02.456 --> 12:04.457
Well, I need you to, 'cause
that's what I can't reach.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.259
If you could root in there
real quick and just

12:06.260 --> 12:08.912
pop 'em out.
Um... ugh.

12:10.347 --> 12:12.148
Let me just, ah...
get in there.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.650
Yeah, oh, okay,
it's hairy, yup.

12:13.651 --> 12:15.434
- Ah, there you go.
- Thanks, man.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.270
Whoa, Mickey. You're not
wearing any underwear.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.806
Do not wear underwear in prison.
Someone could choke you with it.

12:19.807 --> 12:22.008
Well, why don't you leave
the burger suit on then, huh?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.643
All right.

12:23.644 --> 12:25.628
Hey, Mickey's a pretty good worker,
huh? Yeah.

12:25.629 --> 12:28.348
He's the helpful, enthusiastic
employee we've never had.

12:28.349 --> 12:29.983
I wish he'd wear
underwear though.

12:29.984 --> 12:32.118
Yeah, hold the pickle,
ha-ha!

12:35.039 --> 12:37.307
And that's how
you pick the weeds!

12:37.341 --> 12:39.576
Which ones are the weeds?
They all are.

12:39.610 --> 12:42.478
Why are the weeds inside?
So that they aren't outside,

12:42.479 --> 12:43.947
messing up the blueberries.

12:43.981 --> 12:45.848
Why don't you just set
this whole greenhouse on fire?

12:45.849 --> 12:47.317
Be done with it.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.619
Oh, we're going to,
one dime at a time.

12:51.655 --> 12:53.139
I'll sing you a work song.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.691
â™ª Well, we work

12:54.725 --> 12:57.126
â™ª And we work
and we work all day â™ª

12:57.127 --> 12:58.978
â™ª Work, work, work
in America, work â™ª

12:58.979 --> 13:00.830
â™ª And we workin' in the weeds
and American work â™ª

13:00.831 --> 13:03.533
â™ª And workin' in the weeds
and a work, work, work â™ª

13:03.534 --> 13:05.902
â™ª And worky-work-work,
and come on, Gene. â™ª

13:05.903 --> 13:08.388
â™ª Pick up the pace, come on,
buddy, there we go. â™ª

13:08.422 --> 13:09.989
Good day. Hello.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.208
Howdy.

13:12.493 --> 13:13.927
Hi, I have your
blueberry delivery.

13:13.928 --> 13:16.079
Hey all right,
new blueberry girl.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.313
How's this batch,
pretty kind?

13:17.348 --> 13:18.648
Yeah, kind to your body.

13:18.649 --> 13:19.983
Because of antioxidants.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.304
Hello, Belcher child.

13:24.338 --> 13:26.339
Does your father know
what you're doing?

13:26.340 --> 13:29.058
No, he thinks
I'm having summer fun. Good.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.344
Let's keep it that way.
Let's keep it that way.

13:31.345 --> 13:32.845
Ooh, blueberries.

13:32.846 --> 13:35.331
I'm ready for a bake-off.

13:38.002 --> 13:40.169
Tina?

13:40.170 --> 13:41.638
Oh, it's just the refrigerator.

13:41.672 --> 13:42.872
Hey, fridge.

13:42.873 --> 13:44.774
You sure sounded like
Tina a second ago.

13:44.775 --> 13:46.576
Wonder what she's
doing right now.

13:46.610 --> 13:47.877
And I wonder
what Gene's doing.

13:47.878 --> 13:49.112
Probably farting.

13:50.514 --> 13:52.415
What's so funny?

13:52.416 --> 13:54.083
The burger of the day, Bob.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.752
I just noticed it.

13:55.786 --> 13:57.220
The "Beets Me Burger."

13:58.455 --> 13:59.722
That's brilliant.

13:59.723 --> 14:01.257
It works on so many levels.

14:01.292 --> 14:02.892
Well, it's not that good.
I mean...

14:02.893 --> 14:04.927
Louise would come up with
a better one than that.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.397
Like, she would write,
like, "Dia-beets-es Burger,

14:07.398 --> 14:08.598
comes with insulin."

14:08.632 --> 14:10.667
Oh... that's in poor taste, huh?

14:10.701 --> 14:12.368
Sure, but that's what
makes it fun...

14:12.369 --> 14:13.736
That doesn't sound fun.
It sounds hurtful.

14:13.737 --> 14:15.538
That's a really
terrible disease.

14:15.539 --> 14:17.040
Well, I know it is...
My grandmother had that disease.

14:17.041 --> 14:18.641
Well, I'm sorry.
B.B. King has that disease.

14:18.642 --> 14:19.909
Shut up, Mickey.

14:19.910 --> 14:21.144
Sorry, but just hush.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.498
Ten dollars
in my pocket,

14:25.499 --> 14:26.899
Gene got bitten
by a lizard,

14:26.900 --> 14:28.434
we're living
the dream, guys.

14:28.469 --> 14:31.104
I just wish Mom and Dad
worked at the farm with us.

14:31.105 --> 14:33.172
Yeah, I miss making
fun of Dad's B.O.

14:33.173 --> 14:36.075
I'm too scared to make fun
of Cooper and Beverly's smell.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.244
I think there's something
seriously wrong with them.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.579
Hey blueberry girl,

14:39.580 --> 14:41.781
do you have any extra
blueberries on you?

14:41.782 --> 14:44.117
No. And don't ever come
here again, you hear me?

14:44.118 --> 14:46.169
My parents don't know I
deliver blueberries, get it?

14:46.170 --> 14:47.437
Okay, whatever.
No.

14:47.438 --> 14:48.921
Do you get it?

14:48.922 --> 14:51.140
Don't... come...
here... again.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.425
Okay, bye.

14:52.426 --> 14:54.527
That was a close one.

14:54.528 --> 14:55.795
People love fruit!

14:55.796 --> 14:57.430
I will never
understand it.

14:57.431 --> 14:58.965
It's not that good.

15:00.434 --> 15:02.602
Bob.
Hmm?

15:02.603 --> 15:04.437
Mickey's playing
his calypso again.

15:04.438 --> 15:06.205
Can you say somethin'?
You go.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.641
Come on, get up.
All right.

15:14.832 --> 15:17.216
â™ª Is that a parakeet
in my hat? â™ª

15:17.217 --> 15:18.668
â™ª No, no, no

15:18.669 --> 15:20.053
â™ª That's not a parakeet
in ya hat â™ª

15:20.054 --> 15:21.437
â™ª Is that an alligator

15:21.472 --> 15:22.872
Mickey?
â™ª Want to eat the parakeet?

15:22.873 --> 15:24.140
Mickey?
â™ª The alligator say...

15:24.141 --> 15:25.558
Mickey?

15:25.559 --> 15:26.826
â™ª No, I do not
want the parakeet â™ª

15:26.827 --> 15:28.644
Hello, Mickey?!
Ha-ho-ho, hey, Bob!

15:28.679 --> 15:30.546
What's that?
Oh, this?

15:30.547 --> 15:31.881
Oh, you've never seen
this movie? It's great.

15:31.882 --> 15:33.616
It's a guy, he
wants to be big.

15:33.617 --> 15:35.184
Then he gets big, he doesn't
want to be big anymore,

15:35.185 --> 15:36.753
then he gets small,
but the suit's too big.

15:36.787 --> 15:39.322
I'm talking about
behind the poster, Mickey.

15:39.323 --> 15:40.723
Oh, um...

15:40.724 --> 15:41.991
Are you making
a hole in my wall?

15:41.992 --> 15:43.626
No, no, no.
I was fixing that.

15:43.627 --> 15:45.027
Fixing it with a pick?
Yes.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.963
Mickey?
All right, look, Bob.

15:46.964 --> 15:49.132
Don't tell anybody, but I'm
digging my way to the bank.

15:49.166 --> 15:50.967
What? Come on, no.

15:51.001 --> 15:52.251
It's the perfect crime.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.886
I've got double jeopardy!

15:53.887 --> 15:55.455
What do you mean
you have double jeopardy?

15:55.489 --> 15:57.223
I'm robbing the
same bank, Bob.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.825
They can't try me
for it again.

15:58.826 --> 16:00.760
Yes, they can, Mickey.

16:00.761 --> 16:02.328
Look, remember how
you held me hostage?

16:02.329 --> 16:04.163
Of course I do, silly.
That's how we met.

16:04.198 --> 16:07.266
And there were SWAT teams, and
helicopters, and negotiators?

16:07.267 --> 16:09.569
Yeah, it was great, right?
It wasn't great, Mickey.

16:09.570 --> 16:11.537
That's the only time
in my whole life

16:11.538 --> 16:13.906
I ever want to have SWAT guys
pointing guns at my face.

16:13.907 --> 16:15.174
Just that one time.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.476
Never again. Got it?

16:16.510 --> 16:19.162
So, are you cool with me
finishing my tunnel?

16:19.163 --> 16:22.098
No. You may not tunnel
through my basement to a bank.

16:22.099 --> 16:23.516
I forbid it!

16:23.517 --> 16:25.251
Fine, then, Bob,
why don't you fire me?

16:25.252 --> 16:26.486
Okay, you're fired.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.703
You're firing me?!

16:27.738 --> 16:29.372
Look, you can stay tonight,

16:29.373 --> 16:30.873
but tomorrow you're gonna
have to find another place.

16:30.874 --> 16:33.109
Okay. That's cool.

16:33.110 --> 16:35.962
I'm taking the pick.
No!

16:37.364 --> 16:39.549
Oh, Bob. I tell you.
Uh-huh.

16:39.550 --> 16:42.051
It's gonna be really tough
to find a job within 50 feet

16:42.052 --> 16:44.203
of the bank that will also
let me sleep in the basement.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.421
Hmm.

16:45.422 --> 16:46.806
Well, I'm sure
there's something.

16:48.058 --> 16:49.892
Oh, I'm so clumsy.

16:49.893 --> 16:51.561
Better clean that up, Mickey.

16:51.595 --> 16:53.930
Actually, I fired Mickey.
And good news,

16:53.964 --> 16:57.066
I'm hiring you all back
full time, starting right now.

16:57.067 --> 16:58.835
So you can clean it up!

16:58.869 --> 17:01.537
Uh... sorry, Dad,
but we can't do that.

17:01.572 --> 17:04.607
Look, I know what I said before
about wanting you to have fun,

17:04.608 --> 17:07.276
but the thing is,
my childhood was terrible

17:07.277 --> 17:08.511
because I actually
had to work,

17:08.545 --> 17:11.247
and my dad never
smiled or laughed.

17:11.248 --> 17:13.132
Yeah, mine neither.
And he had a drinking problem.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.467
Oh, been there, man.

17:14.468 --> 17:15.902
Open up some fresh
wounds here, Bob.

17:15.903 --> 17:17.303
All right, Mickey, enough.
All right.

17:18.555 --> 17:19.805
I spent last night
thinking about this,

17:19.806 --> 17:21.390
and I'm a pretty good dad.

17:21.425 --> 17:23.291
Yeah, Mom's the one
with the drinking problem.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.328
The problem is I don't have
a friggin' drink in my hand!

17:27.247 --> 17:29.048
The point is, you guys don't
have a hard life, you know?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.583
You just goof around.

17:30.584 --> 17:31.984
And you should be
goofing around

17:31.985 --> 17:33.386
here at home, with us.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.820
Dad, we've moved on.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.756
We got other jobs.
What?!

17:36.757 --> 17:38.457
We're working girls now!

17:38.458 --> 17:39.692
You're a girl?
Yes.

17:39.693 --> 17:40.943
Nah.
Yes.

17:40.944 --> 17:42.261
He's not.
He's not.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.272
No.
Tell that to my vagina!

17:44.859 --> 17:47.839
You got other jobs? What do
you mean, you got other jobs?

17:47.840 --> 17:49.073
What about the restaurant?

17:49.074 --> 17:50.775
Oh, that's adorable, Dad.

17:50.809 --> 17:54.512
You thought that you could snap
your fancy dad fingers

17:54.513 --> 17:57.849
and we'd come
<i>crawling</i> back.

17:57.883 --> 18:00.151
You thought if you didn't
want us, nobody else would?

18:00.185 --> 18:02.820
Well, guess what, Cooper
and Beverly wanted us!

18:02.821 --> 18:04.105
Who's Cooper and Beverly?

18:04.106 --> 18:05.356
Cooper and Beverly?

18:05.357 --> 18:06.924
They're farmers.

18:06.925 --> 18:09.377
And they smell great,
so don't even bother asking.

18:09.411 --> 18:11.212
They still have farms?
Where do they have farms?

18:11.246 --> 18:12.680
Way out in the country

18:12.681 --> 18:14.348
where a man can
breathe the air.

18:14.349 --> 18:16.851
Sorry, Dad. I hope we
can still be friends.

18:16.852 --> 18:18.069
Wait. Wait.
What are they paying you?

18:18.070 --> 18:19.904
I'll match it.
Ten dollars a day.

18:19.905 --> 18:22.123
Never mind.
Have a good day. Bye, guys!

18:25.027 --> 18:28.062
Hey, is that blueberry delivery
girl with the glasses here?

18:28.063 --> 18:29.897
You mean Tina?
She's not here.

18:29.932 --> 18:32.233
Well, I need to return
these blueberries.

18:32.234 --> 18:34.368
Can you tell her they were
mostly stems and seeds?

18:34.369 --> 18:36.737
I want a replacement
or my 40 bucks back.

18:36.738 --> 18:38.205
Okay, I'll let her know.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.541
Okay, bye.
Bye.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.376
That was weird.
Wow, 40 bucks?

18:42.377 --> 18:43.878
Those are
expensive blueberries.

18:43.879 --> 18:45.129
They're probably organic.

18:46.531 --> 18:48.132
Oh, they smell like
a music festival.

18:48.133 --> 18:50.902
Huh, you're right.

18:50.936 --> 18:52.587
Oh, my God, Lin.

18:52.588 --> 18:54.255
Are the kids
working on a pot farm?

18:54.256 --> 18:55.673
Ooh.

18:55.707 --> 18:58.142
Oh, yeah, the old
false-bottom blueberry box.

18:58.143 --> 19:00.044
I remember these
from when I was a kid.

19:00.045 --> 19:01.479
We have to go
get the kids.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.547
But we have no idea
where this pot farm is.

19:03.548 --> 19:05.082
I may have some idea of

19:05.117 --> 19:07.034
exactly where it is.

19:07.069 --> 19:09.236
No, wait, go back,
go back, go back, go back.

19:12.057 --> 19:14.058
Wow, this isn't
what I pictured.

19:14.059 --> 19:15.259
It's nice.

19:15.294 --> 19:16.961
Hey, I've been there, buddy.

19:16.962 --> 19:18.162
Remember, they can't cage this.

19:18.163 --> 19:20.364
What are you doing
on our property?

19:20.399 --> 19:22.733
We want our kids.
What kids? There are no kids here.

19:22.734 --> 19:23.901
Hi, Dad.

19:23.936 --> 19:26.370
Oh, hey...
Hello.

19:26.405 --> 19:28.205
Oh, you mean our kids.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.473
Your kids?
Those are our kids!

19:29.474 --> 19:30.942
Come on, guys.
Get in the car.

19:30.943 --> 19:32.176
Now. Let's go.

19:32.177 --> 19:34.111
Mom, Dad, we already
explained this.

19:34.112 --> 19:36.247
We work here now. Okay?

19:36.248 --> 19:37.448
You're acting
a little desperado.

19:37.482 --> 19:39.383
No, Louise,
you no longer work here.

19:39.418 --> 19:42.019
Dad, small farms are
the backbone of America.

19:42.020 --> 19:43.888
Willie Nelson would
love this place!

19:43.922 --> 19:46.324
Yes, he would, Gene, but not for
the reason you're thinking of.

19:49.995 --> 19:51.445
Oh, no. No, no.

19:51.463 --> 19:53.347
No SWAT teams! No guns!

19:53.348 --> 19:54.966
Code red, Mother!
Code red!

19:54.967 --> 19:56.450
B-Bob, what do I do?

19:56.451 --> 19:58.169
I've never been
an innocent bystander before.

19:58.170 --> 19:59.770
Just get your hands up, Mickey.

19:59.771 --> 20:01.305
Eh, like that?
What?

20:01.306 --> 20:03.007
No. Up.
Like this?

20:03.008 --> 20:04.542
The... you're doing
like kitty paws.

20:04.543 --> 20:06.344
Up. Up. Higher.

20:06.345 --> 20:08.012
Higher? Like that?
No, all the way up.

20:08.013 --> 20:09.347
Like past my shoulders?

20:11.850 --> 20:13.451
Get down! Everybody down!

20:13.485 --> 20:14.669
Hey, I know that guy.

20:14.670 --> 20:16.303
Hi.
Hi.

20:17.305 --> 20:19.323
Pedal, Daddy, pedal!

20:19.324 --> 20:21.692
Right! Left! Right! Left!

20:21.693 --> 20:23.244
â™ª Right, baby, left
â™ª Right, left

20:23.245 --> 20:25.312
Stop!

20:25.313 --> 20:27.248
And, uh, oh,
let's take a right.

20:27.249 --> 20:29.283
Let's keep it moving.
â™ª Right, and turning

20:29.317 --> 20:30.551
â™ª And a little more right.
Stop, please.

20:30.552 --> 20:32.169
Oh, my God.

20:32.170 --> 20:33.587
â™ª We got to get out of here
before they catch us â™ª

20:33.588 --> 20:36.424
Whoa! Now this is summer fun!

20:36.425 --> 20:37.842
Oh, hey, how you doing, guys?

20:37.843 --> 20:39.260
â™ª Let's head over this way.

20:39.261 --> 20:40.661
I'm getting a little dizzy.

20:40.662 --> 20:43.297
<i>And that's why I believe</i>

20:43.331 --> 20:45.199
blueberries should be
decriminalized.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.767
Louise, sit down.

20:48.370 --> 20:50.938
Okay, that's recess.
Uh, be cool out there.

20:50.939 --> 20:53.441
Don't Bogart the snacks.
And if the po-po rolls up,

20:53.442 --> 20:56.010
your first call's
to your lawyer, not your mom.
