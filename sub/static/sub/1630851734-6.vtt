<i>when I was still struggling as an actor,</i>

00:07.007 --> 00:09.801
I had this job
where I literally dressed up

00:09.885 --> 00:12.095
as Spider-Man
for kids' birthday parties.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.681
And the reason why I'm dressed up
as Spider-Man is 'cause

00:14.765 --> 00:16.808
I was Asian and I couldn't show my face.

00:16.892 --> 00:19.937
There weren't any
Asian superheroes, you know?

00:20.020 --> 00:23.815
So, I could only play
one of those heroes with a full mask.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.734
Um...

00:25.817 --> 00:28.779
And it's pretty incredible now that, uh,

00:28.862 --> 00:32.741
you know, not only is Shang-Chi making it
to the big screen, but he has no mask.

00:32.824 --> 00:38.830

01:39.057 --> 01:42.644

01:42.728 --> 01:43.979

The comic was originally
created in the 1970s,

01:52.154 --> 01:56.491

LIU: <i>The moment that I was cast,</i>

12:26.205 --> 12:29.917
we started to have conversations about
what the training regimen would look like.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.002
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

12:32.753 --> 12:35.464

Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go!

12:54.566 --> 12:56.735
Basically, there's two main components.

12:57.861 --> 13:01.490
Strength and conditioning,
and martial arts.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.369
First, we're making sure
the fundamentals are there.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.704
Like flexibility, strength.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.290
<i>He came in</i>
<i>with a lot of strength and power.</i>

13:10.374 --> 13:13.502

<i>on his flexibility.</i>

-One...

-(GRUNTING)

13:18.966 --> 13:21.802
Definitely one of the signs
of a true martial artist

13:21.885 --> 13:24.012
is when they can just drop into splits,

13:24.096 --> 13:26.390
<i>and they have that kind of range of motion</i>

13:26.473 --> 13:28.934
<i>that they trained over months</i>
<i>and months and months.</i>

13:29.017 --> 13:32.479
He has to learn
two different styles of martial arts,

13:32.563 --> 13:37.317
<i>because in our movie, he learns</i>
<i>a very aggressive style from his dad,</i>

13:37.401 --> 13:42.948
<i>and he learns a much more</i>
<i>spiritual flow from his mom.</i>

13:43.031 --> 13:45.742
One main style that we're working
on right now is Tai chi,

13:45.826 --> 13:47.369
which is very, very flowy.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.663
<i>Very, I think,</i>
<i>in harmony with your surroundings.</i>

13:49.746 --> 13:53.041
<i>Another one is Wing Chun,</i>
<i>which is a bit more combative</i>

13:53.125 --> 13:55.294
<i>and then looking</i>
<i>at certain regional styles</i>

13:55.377 --> 13:57.713

<i>to kind of fill in this whole mosaic</i>
<i>of how this character moves.</i>

14:03.010 --> 14:06.722
We took the time to explore a lot.
We explored what his strengths were.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.683

<i>all his weaknesses as well.</i>

<i>I mean, I felt like</i>
<i>it's the actor's responsibility</i>

14:25.699 --> 14:30.621
to kind of become a sponge
and to soak in as much as they can.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.540
Definitely wasn't able to do this

15:22.798 --> 15:25.676
<i>The Mandarin is really</i>
<i>a marquee character from the comics,</i>

15:30.389 --> 15:34.434
They connect us not only to ourselves,
but to everyone who came before.

15:35.435 --> 15:40.357
Shang-Chi's father is Wenwu,
also known as The Mandarin,

15:40.440 --> 15:44.862
<i>who was portrayed to some degree</i>
<i>in</i> Iron Man Three.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.459

15:59.543 --> 16:02.629
we saw that he was just this,
like, kind of dopey actor.

16:02.713 --> 16:04.756
My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.009
Don't hurt the face! I am an actor.

16:07.092 --> 16:10.721
We wanted Shaun to have a father
of great power in China,

16:10.804 --> 16:13.140
<i>and as it happened,</i>
<i>the character of The Mandarin</i>

16:13.223 --> 16:17.144
<i>had already been teased,</i>
<i>but not utilized in any true way.</i>

16:17.227 --> 16:19.146
Going all the way back to <i>Iron Man one,</i>

16:19.229 --> 16:22.691
we've seen this organization called
The Ten Rings pop up in Marvel movies.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.986
<i>We've seen a little bit</i>
<i>in</i> Iron Man <i>one, in</i> Ant-Man.

16:26.069 --> 16:29.823
Then there was this short film
that was released after <i>Iron Man 3</i>

16:29.907 --> 16:32.659
<i>called</i> All Hail the King
<i>that established that Trevor</i>

16:32.743 --> 16:35.829
<i>had been basically sprung from jail</i>
<i>by the true Mandarin,</i>

16:35.913 --> 16:37.247
<i>who we don't see in the film.</i>

16:37.331 --> 16:39.291

16:39.374 --> 16:41.835
-Do I know him?
-No.

16:41.919 --> 16:45.088

Sir Ben come back as Trev.

16:56.225 --> 16:58.227
<i>The way that he plays him</i>

Live on television.

17:11.657 --> 17:12.783
Sounds familiar, right?

17:12.866 --> 17:14.701
You shot a guy on live television?

17:14.785 --> 17:16.954
Yeah. No. Yeah, well, I faked it.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.165
But dramatically speaking,
yes, I did the deed.

17:20.249 --> 17:23.627
This is my third visit to Trevor.

17:23.710 --> 17:28.131
The wonderful thing about Trevor
is that he is an amazing adapter.

Calm down, mate.

Get down here and play along.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.391
<i>As an actor, a craftsman,</i>

17:37.474 --> 17:42.354
that whole package
and that journey over a few years now,

<i>is to me, immensely attractive.</i>

17:46.692 --> 17:48.986
SCHWARTZ: <i>The Ten Rings were</i>
<i>an element from the comics,</i>

17:49.069 --> 17:51.405
which we felt were in need of an update.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.491
In the comics, there are ten rings
that are worn on the fingers,

17:54.575 --> 17:56.243
<i>and they all have different powers.</i>

17:56.326 --> 17:58.787
ANDY PARK: <i>The whole idea</i>
<i>was to try to figure out</i>

17:58.871 --> 18:02.124
<i>a new language, a new power set.</i>

18:02.207 --> 18:05.002
They knew that they didn't wanna do
the rings on the finger

18:05.085 --> 18:07.462
like you see in the comic book.

18:07.546 --> 18:10.340
And probably the main reason
is because of Thanos

18:10.424 --> 18:14.469
and the Infinity Saga
that we just had being too similar.

18:14.553 --> 18:16.597
<i>Destin had the idea</i>
<i>that they would actually be</i>

18:16.680 --> 18:20.350
<i>more of the bracelets rings,</i>
<i>like, martial arts training rings.</i>

18:20.434 --> 18:22.311
SCHWARTZ: <i>What those rings</i>
<i>have become in</i> Shang-Chi,

18:22.394 --> 18:24.521
is kind of Hung Gar inflected
iron Kung fu rings

18:24.605 --> 18:26.899
<i>that pop up a lot in Kung fu cinema</i>

18:26.982 --> 18:29.359
<i>that really feel</i>
<i>a little bit truer to the genre.</i>

18:29.443 --> 18:31.820
The Mandarin first found
the actual physical Ten Rings

18:31.904 --> 18:33.572
that the organization became named for.

18:33.655 --> 18:34.907
<i>And built that organization</i>

18:34.990 --> 18:37.326
<i>from the ground up</i>
<i>with the power of those rings.</i>

18:37.409 --> 18:39.828
Suddenly, the Ten Rings thing
goes from an Easter egg

18:39.912 --> 18:43.999
in the very first MCU movie
to the core of what I think

18:44.082 --> 18:47.419
<i>is one of the greatest father-son</i>
<i>relationships in any of our films.</i>

18:47.503 --> 18:51.089
We will rebuild The Ten Rings
to what it once was.

18:51.173 --> 18:55.093
FEIGE: <i>Thinking about this character,</i>
<i>as the father to Shang-Chi,</i>

18:55.177 --> 18:59.056
<i>as a man who is corrupted by these rings</i>
<i>and corrupted by power,</i>

18:59.139 --> 19:02.309
<i>and who at every turn</i>
<i>kind of wanted to do the right thing.</i>

19:02.392 --> 19:06.355
<i>But his greed or his obsessions</i>
<i>would turn him away from that.</i>

19:06.438 --> 19:10.234
<i>That started to unlock</i>
<i>the notion of doing justice to a character</i>

19:10.317 --> 19:15.072
<i>and more justice than have ever been done</i>
<i>in the comics, frankly.</i>

19:15.155 --> 19:20.327
The Mandarin is a brand
that we wanted to peel away

19:20.410 --> 19:25.374
and understand
the person behind that title.

19:25.457 --> 19:30.546
If there was anybody in the world
who will instantly break the cliché

Asian cinema at all,

CRETTON: <i>The way that Tony Leung</i>
<i>sees that character,</i>

20:37.863 --> 20:40.199

<i>that when it powers on,</i>

21:05.307 --> 21:07.643
the rings would
kind of raise up on the arm.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.687
And then you would see
that it's embedded in there

21:10.771 --> 21:14.650
<i>and it's also just kind of infusing</i>
<i>whatever energy, power</i>

<i>that the rings emit into your whole body.</i>

21:18.695 --> 21:21.865
Wenwu gets drawn to this power.
It's almost like drug.

21:21.949 --> 21:25.327
So, we're try to make
the rings give this sense

21:25.410 --> 21:27.037
<i>that as they're going through his arms,</i>

CRETTON: <i>Those rings are also his chains.</i>

<i>we stayed with the boy.</i>

22:32.311 --> 22:36.315

22:38.525 --> 22:42.029

22:47.201 --> 22:51.580

24:06.738 --> 24:09.366
<i>with all the sets relating to Li,</i>

24:09.449 --> 24:15.247
is that they utilized the five elements,
which is a core idea in Chinese culture.

24:15.330 --> 24:18.375
Fire, metal, water, earth and wood.

You know, the idea is that all these
things are in harmony in Li's life,

24:32.806 --> 24:36.143
and they're in harmony
in the sets in which Li appears

24:36.226 --> 24:38.145
<i>and that she uses her Tai chi,</i>

24:38.228 --> 24:40.856

24:47.279 --> 24:49.823
<i>it was so important to all of us,</i>

24:49.907 --> 24:55.037

24:55.120 --> 24:57.414
<i>with the respect that it deserves</i>

CRETTON: Right there,

CRETTON: <i>Li's character,</i>
<i>a lot of her movements</i>

26:04.147 --> 26:07.901

which is the opposite of aggression.

26:10.904 --> 26:15.993
<i>It's about taking</i>

26:16.076 --> 26:19.705
<i>and reverting that energy back on them.</i>

26:20.664 --> 26:23.876
The style for Tai chi
is not just the martial arts.

26:23.959 --> 26:26.879
It's also a culture. Also a philosophy.

26:26.962 --> 26:30.841

26:44.980 --> 26:48.567
Tai chi, it looks very easy and graceful,

26:48.650 --> 26:51.737

<i>the hardest thing to learn.</i>

26:51.820 --> 26:54.531
<i>Every move has a countermove</i>
<i>on the other side.</i>

26:54.615 --> 26:58.952

<i>to even just understand that concept.</i>

26:59.828 --> 27:01.830
<i>Tony made it look so easy.</i>

27:01.914 --> 27:04.750
<i>He learned all his moves</i>
<i>within the first two days,</i>

27:04.833 --> 27:07.419
<i>and it took me weeks to remember all mine.</i>

27:07.503 --> 27:10.255
What I was doing is tiger-claw.

27:10.964 --> 27:13.967
<i>I think it's more like a symbolic thing.</i>

27:14.051 --> 27:17.137
<i>It's a symbol</i>
<i>of the character's state of mind.</i>

27:17.221 --> 27:20.390
<i>It feels like</i>
<i>it represents the aggressiveness</i>

27:20.474 --> 27:23.644
<i>and anger of Wenwu's character.</i>

27:23.727 --> 27:26.355
Ready, and action.

POPE: <i>Each character</i>

27:29.775 --> 27:33.612
We wanted each person's
character or their emotions,

or the motivations, or the plot
to be carried forward by the fight.

27:38.367 --> 27:39.576

COWAN: <i>Every action sequence</i>
<i>has a different style, flavor.</i>

We've been lucky enough
to work with different designers,

LIU: <i>Certainly, we take a lot</i>
<i>of influences from Chinese Kung fu,</i>

27:56.426 --> 27:58.470
between a Kung fu movie
and a Marvel movie.

That's what Destin and this movie

32:33.829 --> 32:37.749
One of the things
that Chris constantly says,

<i>Enhancing something</i>
<i>that is rooted in reality,</i>

32:51.972 --> 32:56.768
Our role was to build a rig that could
simulate that kind of bus motion.

32:56.852 --> 33:00.439
So, for this particular bus,
we're using a six-axis gimbal.

33:00.522 --> 33:03.901
What the six-axis gimbal gives
us is six degrees of freedom.

33:03.984 --> 33:08.113
So, we get heave, which is up and down.
We get pitch, which is forward and back.

33:08.280 --> 33:11.575
We get roll, which side to side.
We get yaw as well.

33:11.658 --> 33:15.537
<i>So, we get all those motions which</i>
<i>can be programmed into the system</i>

33:15.662 --> 33:19.708
<i>to give the bus pretty much any motion</i>
<i>that would seem real-life.</i>

33:21.210 --> 33:25.255
We had to choreograph the fights according
to the streets of San Francisco,

33:25.422 --> 33:27.841
<i>of their dips, their curves,</i>
<i>rounds or turns,</i>

33:28.217 --> 33:30.385

46:40.759 --> 46:43.846
CALLAHAM: <i>The Fu dogs, which looks sort</i>
<i>of like lion, sort of like dogs.</i>

46:43.929 --> 46:46.056
<i>There's always two</i>
<i>on both sides of an entrance.</i>

46:46.139 --> 46:48.725
They're very built into Chinese mythology.

46:49.184 --> 46:53.063
<i>To be able to finally see</i>
<i>what one looks like is amazing.</i>

46:55.315 --> 46:58.068
I have a lovely companion, Morris,

46:58.318 --> 47:02.030
who's a pet and a companion
and a guide and a mentor.

47:02.114 --> 47:03.115
My animus.

47:03.198 --> 47:05.117
-KATY: Oh, oh!
-What is that?

47:05.200 --> 47:07.578
-What's what? What's what?
-That. That. That.

47:07.744 --> 47:08.787
This is Morris.

47:08.871 --> 47:12.457
Morris is based on a Hundun,
which is a mythological character

47:12.708 --> 47:15.460
<i>thought to be sort of the</i>
<i>God of Chaos and Confusion.</i>

47:15.878 --> 47:19.631
We use this stuffy for our
sort of what we call a proxy,

47:19.882 --> 47:21.425
<i>which gives the actors a prop,</i>

47:21.508 --> 47:25.012
<i>so that they can be physically holding</i>
<i>something and reacting to it.</i>

47:25.470 --> 47:27.472
<i>At one point, we actually asked Sir Ben,</i>

47:27.556 --> 47:29.850
if it was okay
if we change this for something else,

47:29.933 --> 47:33.020
and he said, "No, no,
I've grown quite fond of Morris."

47:33.562 --> 47:38.442
KINGSLEY: <i>I built a rapport with Davi,</i>
<i>who operates Morris.</i>

47:38.525 --> 47:40.861
I said, "Davi, you are my puppeteer.

47:41.111 --> 47:44.823
"You are my fellow actor.
We must build a rapport."

47:44.907 --> 47:47.784
So, I was not working
with an abstract lump of green.

47:47.868 --> 47:49.411
<i>I was working with a creature</i>

47:49.494 --> 47:52.664
<i>because Davi was so sensitive</i>
<i>in the scene to,</i>

47:52.748 --> 47:54.374
<i>"What would Morris do in this scene?"</i>

47:54.499 --> 47:57.127
He'd probably jump up,
he'd probably want a little tickle,

47:57.211 --> 47:58.587
or he'd probably be scared,

47:58.670 --> 48:00.672
or he'd probably want
to wake his master up.

48:00.756 --> 48:05.427
Perfect. So, a green screen, and visual
effects do not have to be deadly.

48:07.346 --> 48:08.722
YING NAN:
You were everything to her.

48:10.349 --> 48:12.601
She knew that one day
you would find your way here

48:12.768 --> 48:15.479
<i>and asked me to prepare</i>
<i>something for your arrival.</i>

48:16.855 --> 48:21.318
I knew that I was gonna get a suit.
Every superhero has a suit.

48:21.568 --> 48:23.445
Our first day with the suit.

48:24.613 --> 48:26.949
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-Which is really exciting.

48:27.074 --> 48:32.746
BARRETT: <i>Shang-Chi's hero costume</i>
<i>was a Marvel illustration by Andy Park.</i>

48:33.038 --> 48:39.586
He's definitely starting to leave behind
some of his American culture

48:39.670 --> 48:44.716
<i>and clothing looks and getting</i>
<i>slowly closer to his true self.</i>

48:45.092 --> 48:49.137
The main thing as a character designer
that I'm trying to do,

48:49.346 --> 48:51.890
is bring a story into his look.

48:52.224 --> 48:56.353
<i>For Shang-Chi,</i>
<i>his story is really about his family.</i>

48:56.436 --> 48:58.063
<i>His mother comes from Ta Lo,</i>

48:58.188 --> 48:59.815
<i>so from the great protector,</i>

48:59.940 --> 49:03.360
<i>I wanted to incorporate dragon scales,</i>
<i>dragon skin.</i>

49:03.694 --> 49:06.029
<i>When it came to the triangle motif,</i>

49:06.113 --> 49:11.702
I had the idea of incorporating
the infinite knot or the endless knot.

49:11.869 --> 49:14.663
<i>It's a symbol that has been used</i>
<i>throughout various cultures</i>

49:14.746 --> 49:15.831
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

49:15.956 --> 49:18.041
<i>And certainly, in Chinese culture.</i>

49:18.125 --> 49:22.087
It symbolizes the endless cycle of life
and death and rebirth,

49:22.171 --> 49:25.007
which is definitely applicable
to the story of Shang-Chi.

49:25.382 --> 49:28.177
<i>When he ran away,</i>
<i>he came to America.</i>

49:28.343 --> 49:32.556
<i>So, even though he's given the suit,</i>
<i>I wanted one element to be his.</i>

49:32.723 --> 49:34.975
<i>So, that's why you saw him</i>
<i>with his Air Jordans.</i>

49:35.184 --> 49:36.935
<i>He's also a product of his father.</i>

49:37.102 --> 49:42.733
<i>So, at the end of the film, he receives</i>
<i>the Ten Rings, which completes his look.</i>

49:42.983 --> 49:46.320
You see his mom, you see his dad,

49:46.570 --> 49:49.573
<i>you see when he was living in America</i>
<i>and his shoes.</i>

49:49.823 --> 49:53.452
<i>So, it tells the full story</i>
<i>of his whole journey.</i>

49:54.536 --> 49:57.206
Of course, there is nowhere
to go buy dragon skin.

49:57.331 --> 50:01.960
<i>And, so, for us,</i>
<i>that means carving all the scales,</i>

50:02.044 --> 50:05.214
<i>and then molding hundreds and thousands</i>
<i>and thousands of scales.</i>

50:05.297 --> 50:10.677
<i>And in fact, each suit has about</i>
<i>14,000 tiny individual scales,</i>

50:10.761 --> 50:13.805
glued on to it, by hand, by our team.

50:15.682 --> 50:18.560
To be honest, it was very emotional,
trying it on for the first time.

50:20.395 --> 50:24.900
<i>I understood the weight and the gravity</i>
<i>and the significance of what that meant,</i>

50:24.983 --> 50:28.862

<i>just how precious few people</i>

50:28.946 --> 50:30.739
<i>experience that kind of feeling.</i>

the suit for the first time?

50:36.036 --> 50:37.454
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

-(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

50:57.558 --> 51:03.188
Watching Michelle kick Simu's butt
was really fun.

51:06.400 --> 51:09.403
It was very surreal shooting
that scene with Michelle

51:09.486 --> 51:13.907
because I've been such a die-hard fan
of hers for so long

51:13.991 --> 51:16.243
<i>and to be able to meet her</i>
<i>and work with her</i>

51:16.326 --> 51:20.038
<i>and find out how lovely she is,</i>
<i>how silly she is,</i>

51:20.122 --> 51:22.332
(CHUCKLING) <i>how weird she is,</i>

51:22.416 --> 51:26.628
and how much fun she is,
was really a huge highlight for all of us.

51:26.879 --> 51:31.383
In terms of Asian representation and
especially female Asian representation,

51:31.508 --> 51:36.180
Michelle has always played
nothing but strong women,

51:36.388 --> 51:38.682
<i>and growing up watching someone like that,</i>

51:38.849 --> 51:41.810
it impacts who you want to become
and how you see yourself,

51:41.894 --> 51:44.021
especially when there are not a lot of us.

51:44.605 --> 51:47.983
Working with Michelle, who's so good.

51:48.901 --> 51:52.154
'Cause when you're doing Tai chai
with two people, it's like a dance,

51:52.237 --> 51:55.699

as well as the other person flows.

<i>She's so just steady and graceful</i>
<i>in all of her movements.</i>

52:01.371 --> 52:04.458
I feel like a bit of a schlub next to her,

52:04.541 --> 52:08.295
<i>but thankfully, that's kind of the cadence</i>
<i>of the fight to begin with.</i>

52:10.214 --> 52:12.382
So, I think I played my part very well.

52:24.686 --> 52:25.687
Yes!

<i>of father and mother within Shaun.</i>

59:10.092 --> 59:13.011
Shaun and Wenwu
are trying to find each other again,

59:13.136 --> 59:16.431
<i>rather than just being</i>
<i>about who's stronger than the other,</i>

59:16.515 --> 59:18.433
<i>whose martial arts are better. It's like,</i>

59:18.600 --> 59:21.395
<i>this is a family that's trying</i>
<i>to find its way back together.</i>

59:21.478 --> 59:23.856
And I think that's
really beautiful for a fight.

59:31.947 --> 59:33.699
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

59:33.782 --> 59:37.786
CRETTON: <i>It's really been incredible</i>
<i>to watch Simu sink into this character</i>

59:37.870 --> 59:39.830
and take complete ownership over it.

59:39.913 --> 59:43.208
Over the course of this year,
I've watched him

59:43.625 --> 59:47.588
in a lot of ways, go on the journey
that Shang-Chi goes on.

59:47.838 --> 59:50.799
<i>Shang-Chi starts out in this movie</i>

59:50.924 --> 59:52.551
<i>completely out of his element</i>

59:52.676 --> 59:56.805
<i>and learns over the course</i>
<i>of this journey,</i>

59:57.139 --> 1:00:01.810
<i>how to own himself,</i>
<i>how to be happy with himself,</i>

1:00:01.894 --> 1:00:05.564
<i>and look in the mirror</i>
<i>and be proud of what he sees.</i>

1:00:06.273 --> 1:00:11.028
<i>And I've watched Simu really</i>
<i>tap into that character.</i>

1:00:11.361 --> 1:00:15.824
It was a very inspiring
and moving experience for me to witness.

1:00:18.952 --> 1:00:20.454
And cutting.

1:00:22.789 --> 1:00:29.004
Finishing picture to our Meng'er
and our lead man, Simu.

1:00:29.379 --> 1:00:31.798
-Finishing picture.
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

1:00:42.226 --> 1:00:43.310
Finally!

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:47.814
<i>I was a kid who was born</i>
<i>halfway around the world,</i>

1:00:47.898 --> 1:00:50.150
<i>who immigrated</i>
<i>when he was very young</i>

1:00:50.234 --> 1:00:53.028
<i>and had parents that never even dreamed of</i>

1:00:53.153 --> 1:00:55.656
<i>allowing their son to go into</i>
<i>show business.</i>

1:00:56.281 --> 1:01:03.247
It just feels like I was plucked out of my
life and sent on this wild, wild ride.

1:01:03.330 --> 1:01:07.084
And I'm still trying to figure out,
"How did I get picked?"

1:01:10.963 --> 1:01:12.381
I have no words.

1:01:12.464 --> 1:01:15.175
(HESITATES) This is the most
incredible thing for me.

1:01:15.467 --> 1:01:18.679
<i>Guys, this is as much</i>
<i>as a Cinderella story for me</i>

1:01:18.887 --> 1:01:20.889
as you could ever find in the universe.

1:01:21.139 --> 1:01:23.851
I mean, a year ago, I was just some guy

1:01:23.934 --> 1:01:26.311
and now, for some reason, I'm a superhero,

1:01:26.395 --> 1:01:29.022
and you guys all helped
make that dream come true.

1:01:29.106 --> 1:01:32.693
And I honestly am so blown away
by all of your work.

1:01:32.776 --> 1:01:34.528
-(APPLAUSE)
-(CREW MEMBER WHISTLING)

1:01:34.611 --> 1:01:38.866
I know that it probably
doesn't hold a lot of water

1:01:38.949 --> 1:01:42.494
when I say that you're the best film crew
that I've ever worked with...

1:01:42.578 --> 1:01:43.912
(LAUGHTER)

1:01:43.996 --> 1:01:47.040
...but you're the best film crew
that I will ever work with,

1:01:47.124 --> 1:01:48.458
so, there you go.

1:01:48.542 --> 1:01:49.960
(APPLAUSE)

1:01:50.043 --> 1:01:52.045
(EMOTIONAL MUSIC PLAYING)

1:01:53.839 --> 1:01:57.301
You know, as a movie fan,
I grew up on American movies

1:01:57.384 --> 1:02:01.513
and I've never seen characters
like myself on-screen,

1:02:01.597 --> 1:02:03.348
<i>it's incredibly meaningful.</i>

1:02:03.432 --> 1:02:04.808
<i>It's incredibly important.</i>

1:02:04.933 --> 1:02:08.020
YEOH: <i>I've grown up</i>
<i>looking at the Marvel Comics</i>

1:02:08.103 --> 1:02:10.397
<i>and know a bit about the Marvel world.</i>

1:02:10.647 --> 1:02:14.943
And I've never seen a superhero
that looks something like me.

1:02:15.152 --> 1:02:19.156
And I'm really pleased
because it truly is the right time

1:02:19.323 --> 1:02:21.909
<i>for our little boys</i>
<i>and girls to go and say,</i>

1:02:21.992 --> 1:02:23.744
"Oh, look, we're superheroes, too."

1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:27.998
AWKWAFINA: <i>When you see a superhero,</i>
<i>you see yourself.</i>

1:02:28.081 --> 1:02:31.793
I think that's the really important
thing that movies like this does for kids.

1:02:31.877 --> 1:02:33.712
It allows them to feel the possibility,

1:02:33.795 --> 1:02:35.297
<i>and it's only going to add to that</i>

1:02:35.380 --> 1:02:38.967
<i>and hopefully, will continue to open</i>
<i>the door for more movies like this.</i>

1:02:40.344 --> 1:02:43.013
CRETTON: <i>I hope </i>Shang-Chi<i> is another step.</i>

1:02:43.180 --> 1:02:46.225
If <i>Shang-Chi</i> is the end,
then we have failed.

1:02:46.517 --> 1:02:52.773
<i>I could not be more proud of the way that</i>
<i>this movie has allowed us to bring up</i>

1:02:52.856 --> 1:02:56.944
<i>more representation, both,</i>
<i>in front of and behind the camera.</i>

1:02:57.027 --> 1:03:03.116
And I think the world just is hungry
for movies that reflect who we are

1:03:03.283 --> 1:03:04.618
<i>and all of our colors.</i>

1:03:06.411 --> 1:03:08.413
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

1:03:09.373 --> 1:03:12.751
SCHWARTZ: <i>I think Shang-Chi has</i>
<i>a very bright future within the MCU.</i>

1:03:12.835 --> 1:03:16.046
When I look forward to super teams
and crossovers,

1:03:16.588 --> 1:03:19.174
<i>Shaun feels like this huge,</i>
<i>untapped reservoir</i>

1:03:19.299 --> 1:03:22.511
<i>of great possibilities</i>
<i>from Simu and beyond.</i>

1:03:22.636 --> 1:03:24.054
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

1:03:27.975 --> 1:03:32.104
And that's our show. So, thank you for
tuning in to watch this documentary.

1:03:32.229 --> 1:03:34.940
I hope you learned something
about the magic of filmmaking,

1:03:35.023 --> 1:03:39.736
or something about Marvel
or cinema or anything.

1:03:39.820 --> 1:03:43.824
But it's been my pleasure
to spend the last little while with you

1:03:43.907 --> 1:03:46.827
and I can't wait for you to see the movie.

1:03:46.994 --> 1:03:48.328
Take care.

1:03:50.539 --> 1:03:52.541
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

1:04:21.069 --> 1:04:23.906
(CHUCKLING) I don't think
this will make the documentary.
