that you would be.

on me

and not yours.

Okay, I get that you're
in college now, Zoey,

17:59.580 --> 18:01.920

and pick up clothes

18:01.920 --> 18:03.960

to be there for her

made it clear to you

18:39.620 --> 18:42.120
that we're not
just homeowners.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.580
We're Black homeowners,
and because we're Black,

18:44.580 --> 18:47.670
we have to look at things
through kind of a dual lens.

18:47.670 --> 18:50.170
You know, we need to think
about every situation

18:50.170 --> 18:52.460
and how it should
go normally,

18:52.460 --> 18:55.540
and how it could go
'cause we're Black.

18:55.540 --> 18:59.880
Like, being asked to sit on the
curb while they checked your ID.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.170
They didn't ask any of
the white people to do that.

19:02.170 --> 19:05.670
Mnh-mnh.
Yeah, it's different
for us, baby boy.

19:05.670 --> 19:07.670

that were handcuffed

19:07.670 --> 19:09.670

at Starbucks.

19:16.670 --> 19:18.880

to think

19:18.880 --> 19:20.750
that someone would call
the police on you

19:20.750 --> 19:23.170
just because they thought
you didn't belong there

19:23.170 --> 19:25.120
because of the color
of your skin.
Mm-hmm.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.710

of what could happen.

19:27.710 --> 19:29.540

on Black people

19:29.540 --> 19:31.880
