Yeah, sounded like you found
something unexpected in there.

33:16.524 --> 33:17.591
What was it?

33:19.677 --> 33:21.478
It was a letter.

From Farouk... to my father.

33:25.140 --> 33:26.416
What?

33:26.484 --> 33:29.019
Thanking him for their long
and fruitful friendship.

It was before we started
working together.

It implies my dad helped
fund his terror operation.

Okay, so how did they
know where to find you?

34:16.134 --> 34:17.667
My source went dark.

us who your source is?

34:27.751 --> 34:29.619
that Serapis was onto
us from the beginning

34:30.025 --> 34:31.494
