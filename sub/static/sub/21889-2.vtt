Oh, thanks, Freddy.

There's nothing like a Mango Madness
after my six a.m. Zumba class.

01:10.820 --> 01:11.654
Mmm.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.031
There's my Uber.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.492
My sister took my car last night,
and she never made it back.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.037
Here. Keep the cha-cha-change.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.246
[laughs]

01:20.330 --> 01:22.165
Come on, not even a cha-cha-chuckle?

01:27.253 --> 01:28.379
Hi. I'm DJ.

01:31.007 --> 01:31.841
Oh.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.384
I have the exact same car.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.094
You're Ilsa?

01:35.178 --> 01:36.596
[in Swedish accent] Uh... Ja.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.514
Ilsa.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.100
I've never had
a Swedish Uber driver before.

01:41.935 --> 01:42.769
Ja.

01:42.852 --> 01:43.686
Ilsa.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.609
Stephanie!

01:50.235 --> 01:51.402
Stephanie? Ja?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.447
What are you doing with my car?

01:55.281 --> 01:57.492
Well, I was rehearsing all night
with my band,

01:57.575 --> 02:00.245
and I just figured I'd pick up a few fares
on the way home.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.455
You're using my car as an Uber?

02:02.997 --> 02:04.374
Ah, Ilsa is.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.377
Stephanie only had a one-star rating,
but Ilsa is killing it.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.131
Excuse me. What are you doing?

02:11.214 --> 02:12.841
Chill, Deej, this is an Uber Pool.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.968
This is Dennis.
Dennis is going to the airport.

02:15.051 --> 02:18.429
Here, would you care for some
orange slices or some bottled water?

02:19.430 --> 02:21.516
Hey! Those are for Max's soccer team.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.852
Deej, they're oh and six,
they don't deserve snacks.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.064
Ooh! Hello, cologne.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.525
This is Larry. Larry's going to the pier.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.068
OK, everybody, seat belts, please?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.238
Whoa!

02:35.738 --> 02:36.739
Oh, Dennis!

02:36.823 --> 02:39.159
Larry, we're really getting
to know each other.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.250
["Pop Goes the Weasel" plays]

02:50.837 --> 02:52.005
[DJ] Amazing!

02:53.173 --> 02:56.593
You've seen this 800 times,
and it's still a surprise.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.178
Top of the morning, people.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.473
As you can tell by my ensem,

03:02.557 --> 03:04.517
I'm having a pool party today.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.396
[wistfully] With my lady, Rose.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.609
I should do some push-ups to stay swole.

03:17.780 --> 03:18.865
Oh, yeah.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.617
Locked and loaded.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.787
Little Romeo, can Tommy come?

03:24.871 --> 03:27.081
Sure.
As long as he doesn't cramp my style.

03:27.749 --> 03:28.958
You hear me, Tommy?

03:29.542 --> 03:30.460
[blows raspberry]

03:32.837 --> 03:34.589
Mom, have you had him evaluated yet?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.594
Tommy's fine.

03:40.428 --> 03:41.262
All right.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.514
If you're not worried, I'm not worried.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.269
Mom,
I'd love to go to summer school today,

03:48.353 --> 03:49.604
but unfortunately,

03:49.687 --> 03:51.439
I got a bad case of head lice.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.777
-Really? Let me take a look.
-Ah.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.487
You don't want to come too close.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.571
It's gross.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.035
[light tapping sound]

04:06.204 --> 04:08.164
Nice try, Jackson. This is rice.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.458
What?

04:10.541 --> 04:12.460
I'm infested with lice and rice?

04:14.671 --> 04:15.797
Get going.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.675
I told you to go with the couscous.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.261
[Jackson sighs]

04:23.137 --> 04:24.514
Nobody talk to me.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.016
I'm very upset, and I'm not in the mood
to talk about it.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.686
What are you upset about?

04:30.937 --> 04:32.981
Wow. You're not gonna let this go,
are you?

04:34.774 --> 04:35.608
OK.

04:35.692 --> 04:39.821
Steve wants a Japanese wedding planner
for his Japanese wedding in Japan.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.740
Oh, he has lost his mind.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.034
He sure has.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.996
I'm a wedding planner,
and I was never even considered.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.500
Because I don't speak Japanese
and I've never been to Japan,

04:53.042 --> 04:56.629
and the only thing I know about them
is they have a huge Godzilla problem.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.007
Here we go.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.341
Oh, yes.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.592
Here we do go.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.970
I'm gonna get Steve to change his mind,

05:04.053 --> 05:05.221
and you're gonna help me.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.139
Mom, no.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.850
It'll be a great mother-daughter
bonding experience.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.144
I have plans with Popko.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.687
You can come to Japan with me.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.856
Sayonara, Popko.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.901
Hola, sad friends.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.487
And soon to be former roomies.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.533
As you know,
today I will be moving next door,

05:25.616 --> 05:26.993
into the old Gibbler home.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.912
I know how much you will miss me,

05:29.996 --> 05:32.415
so here's a roll of Bounty for your tears.

05:35.209 --> 05:36.252
Kimberlina,

05:36.335 --> 05:38.212
it is not too late to change your mind,

05:38.838 --> 05:39.797
and move in with me.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.593
I told you. I like it here.
I'm not moving.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.261
Gee.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.263
You could soft pedal it a little bit.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.602
[Stephanie shouts] DJ, Kimmy,
get in here, great news!

05:53.394 --> 05:55.229
You guys are being so strong.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.900
But I know my leaving is killing you.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.613
Just leave your house key on the counter.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.449
Such courage.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.537
Fellow she-wolves, my Uber days are over.

06:11.621 --> 06:15.583
Behold, my first Spotify check
for my song "The Boy Next Door."

06:15.666 --> 06:16.542
Ka-ching!

06:18.252 --> 06:19.170
[DJ] Congratulations!

06:19.253 --> 06:21.297
Congratulations!

06:21.380 --> 06:25.259
Now you can pay me back the money you
borrowed to buy Kimmy's Christmas present.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.179
Hey!

06:28.262 --> 06:30.932
I lent Stephanie money
to buy your Christmas present.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.018
What can I say? I'm a giver.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.896
Then give us our money back.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.567
Man, all the relatives come out
of the woodwork when you get rich.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.321
All right. Here we go.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.656
50,000 streams.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.491
That has got to be worth...

06:50.201 --> 06:51.953
Three dollars and 35 cents?

06:53.871 --> 06:54.914
That can't be right.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.332
It's not.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.084
That's before taxes.

06:59.669 --> 07:03.297
OK, look, I'll admit,
my finances aren't exactly in order,

07:03.381 --> 07:06.926
and I don't have my own car,
or a bank account,

07:07.009 --> 07:08.511
and I live in my dad's basement,

07:08.594 --> 07:10.430
but, yeah, on the plus side, it's...

07:11.222 --> 07:12.390
Plus side, anyone?

07:15.017 --> 07:16.936
OK, I'll admit, I'm a mess.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.606
No, you just need a little help
getting your act together.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.901
Have you ever thought about a life coach?

07:25.319 --> 07:26.612
I can't afford that.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.322
I can't afford anything.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.907
I mean, I am down to one good bra.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.371
Well, what if I knew a life coach
who would do it for free?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.457
Someone who's got it totally together--

07:37.540 --> 07:40.585
emotionally, spiritually, physically,

07:41.169 --> 07:43.963
but it's her modesty
that is the envy of all.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.301
Gee, I wonder who you're talking about?

07:49.844 --> 07:50.678
Me.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.055
-You?
-Yeah, me.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.056
What about me?

07:54.140 --> 07:55.808
-You?
-Yeah, me.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.059
What about me?

07:57.143 --> 07:58.102
You?

07:58.186 --> 07:59.020
Yeah, me.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.688
Wait, what are we talking about?

08:01.939 --> 08:03.733
Whatever it was, I don't care anymore.

08:03.816 --> 08:04.692
Unless it's lunch.

08:04.775 --> 08:07.445
In which case, I'll take a Cobb salad,
dressing on the side.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.491
Oh, come on!

08:11.574 --> 08:13.284
Let me be your life coach.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.996
Well, as hard as this is for me to say,

08:17.663 --> 08:18.706
I could use your help.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.959
Yes! Glorious day in the morning!

08:22.043 --> 08:24.378
Oh, I knew this moment would come.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.766
Fixing Stephanie by Donna Jo Fuller?

08:38.684 --> 08:39.685
Why is this so thick?

08:39.769 --> 08:41.729
I've been working on it
since high school.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.149
Let's start with the two-mile fun run.

08:46.984 --> 08:47.944
You can do this.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.947
You... can... do... this!

08:52.365 --> 08:53.533
OK. I hear you.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.576
But your crazy eyes are freaking me out.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.292
Steph, do you need help?

09:03.376 --> 09:05.962
[Stephanie] Oh, no, you've done enough.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.635
Sweet cheese, what happened to her?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.055
Stephanie broke her ankle on our run.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.725
Which wouldn't have happened
if my life coach hadn't been racing me

09:19.809 --> 09:21.269
because she always has to win.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.313
What... I don't always have to win.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.066
Then why did you yell out,
"Last one home is a rotten egg,"

09:27.149 --> 09:29.193
and then you let out
your evil witch laugh.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.444
[Stephanie cackles]

09:31.821 --> 09:33.406
I don't sound like that.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.157
Yeah, it's more like...

09:35.241 --> 09:36.867
[cackles]

09:39.579 --> 09:41.247
I'm sorry about your accident,

09:41.330 --> 09:45.042
but you shouldn't have tried to catch me
by running through that lady's yard.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.421
Well, I would have been fine,
if she hadn't turned the hose on me.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.340
Then I stepped in that gopher hole.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.135
Sweet cheese. That is some story.

09:57.179 --> 10:00.308
[gasps] Oh, no, you have broken your leg.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.020
It's my ankle. I stepped in a gopher hole.

10:04.604 --> 10:08.524
You were distracted because you were
so upset about me leaving.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.736
Nope, that's not it.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.904
There, there.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.074
I know it's a dark day.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.118
But I will cheer you up.

10:19.702 --> 10:20.786
I will sign my name.

10:21.746 --> 10:22.788
Please don't.

10:22.872 --> 10:23.789
It is no trouble.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.499
Fer...

10:25.583 --> 10:27.460
nan... do.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.128
OK, first name's just fine.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.547
Hernandez.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.133
You know what? That's--
It's good. Stop signing.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.885
-How long is your name?
-Guerrero.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.011
Give me the pen. Stop.

10:40.973 --> 10:41.807
Here.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.685
I want you to spend the day
working on your five-year plan.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.647
I'm gonna take the day off.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.107
And the next five years. That's my plan.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.153
Come on. Remember what I told you.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.907
"When life gives you dilemmas,
make dilemonade."

10:59.533 --> 11:00.951
Is that what you were saying?

11:01.035 --> 11:03.120
I couldn't hear
over the ambulance sirens.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.582
Wait, what? What's that I hear?

11:07.249 --> 11:09.710

11:09.794 --> 11:11.128
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

I actually got knocked down,
and I can't get up again, so wrong song.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.842
No, perfect song.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.538
But I am very proud of you
for getting in the spirit.
