00:03.690 --> 00:06.349
Explain yourself, T'Challa, now.

00:06.350 --> 00:09.139
Black Panther, what
has happened here?

00:09.140 --> 00:12.229
He was trying to use
that Crown for himself.

00:12.230 --> 00:14.559
Cap tried to stop
him and Panther.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.479
He destroyed him.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.479
This cannot be so.

00:18.480 --> 00:21.729
Because it is not, Thor.

00:21.730 --> 00:25.051
Captain America and I were trying
to stop the Crown together.

00:25.690 --> 00:29.276
Whatever you believe you saw,
Black Widow, you are mistaken.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.645
All of you, I am
still your friend.

00:32.770 --> 00:36.559
Aye. Black Panther is an
Avenger and our ally.

00:36.560 --> 00:40.099
No, not anymore.
He quit, remember?

00:40.100 --> 00:43.349
And if she says it's true, it's true.
Tell him, Nat.

00:43.350 --> 00:47.099
I saw the two of them break off from
the fight with the Shadow Council.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.099
I followed them all
the way down here.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.099
They were fighting
over the Crown.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.689
Panther let Cap get
caught in the blast.

00:53.690 --> 00:56.559
Captain America sacrificed
himself to protect us all.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.479
I saw what I saw.

00:58.480 --> 01:01.019
- Captain America...
- Isn't here to back you up.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.310
Convenient, huh?

01:02.511 --> 01:04.599
Okay, here's the plan.

01:04.599 --> 01:08.019
T'Challa, you and that Crown are
coming with us to Avengers Tower.

01:08.020 --> 01:09.806
We'll sort this out there.

01:09.807 --> 01:12.769
No! I will not allow you
to touch the Crown.

01:12.770 --> 01:16.059
Are you threatening
us, friend Panther?

01:16.060 --> 01:18.899
The Crown is more
dangerous than you know.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.769
We tried to contain its
power here and failed.

01:21.770 --> 01:24.439
I must be allowed to
take it with me, now!

01:24.440 --> 01:28.349
You lost your vote when you
lied to us and attacked Cap.

01:28.350 --> 01:32.599
I did not attack him. And
I am a king, Hawkeye.

01:32.600 --> 01:36.229
I do not vote. The Crown
is going with me.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.059
If you insist on
blocking my path,

01:38.060 --> 01:40.060
I will be forced to
use extreme measures.

01:42.230 --> 01:44.639
Good. That'll make
the fight fair.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.849
Since when is four against
one a fair fight?

01:47.850 --> 01:49.357
Princess Shuri!

01:52.900 --> 01:55.690
O-kay. That doesn't look good.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:23.563 --> 02:26.686
I was able to build a new
containment box for the Crown.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.419
These three bars are all we
had left at the embassy.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.266
- Once the Crown depletes them...
- Yes.

02:33.330 --> 02:35.548
There will be great
danger without

02:35.560 --> 02:37.789
sufficient Vibranium to
dampen its energies.

02:39.290 --> 02:41.449
The Shrouded Temple was
filled with Vibranium.

02:41.450 --> 02:43.579
The structure, the circuits...
everything.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.579
We'll need at least that
much to keep it stable.

02:45.580 --> 02:48.199
The temple is destroyed.
There is only one place

02:48.200 --> 02:49.778
where we can find
that much Vibranium.

02:54.290 --> 02:56.869
If we don't get this back to
Wakanda before these bars run out,

02:56.870 --> 02:59.160
half of North America
will be vaporized.

03:02.471 --> 03:03.659
Hold on.

03:04.681 --> 03:06.329
I'm rerouting power
from your armor.

03:06.330 --> 03:09.159
That should help sustain the
Crown until we reach Wakanda.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.949
Till then, you'll be
on auxiliary power.

03:10.950 --> 03:12.699
Understood.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.869
But exactly how much
time does that give us?

03:14.870 --> 03:17.659
The Crown will burn right through
that Vibranium in a few hours.

03:17.660 --> 03:19.659
Barely enough time to
get back to Wakanda,

03:19.660 --> 03:21.869
unless your friends want
to lend us an Avenjet.

03:21.870 --> 03:26.080
Unlikely. But there is
an alternative. Come.

03:30.870 --> 03:33.119
Stand down, Your Majesty.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.289
Don't make this uglier
than it has to be.

03:35.290 --> 03:37.829
- Captain Marvel...
- I mean it, T'Challa.

03:37.830 --> 03:39.633
I'm not asking twice.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.079
You have to stop this.
Just come with us

03:43.080 --> 03:45.829
before it gets out of, uh, hand.

03:45.830 --> 03:48.909
Ms. Marvel... Carol,
you do not understand.

03:48.910 --> 03:50.949
We must return to
Wakanda without delay.

03:50.950 --> 03:54.119
Wakanda? Tony told us
what you did to Cap.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.499
The only place you're
going is a holding cell.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.699
But if you come
in on your own...

03:58.700 --> 04:00.579
I mean, we're all friends.

04:00.580 --> 04:04.289
Maybe you've got an explanation for...
what happened, right?

04:04.290 --> 04:06.579
I would totally give you
a chance to explain.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.499
He used up his chances
when he vaporized Cap.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.119
Shuri, go!

04:12.120 --> 04:13.641
Get the princess!

04:14.950 --> 04:17.409
Okay. I guess we're doing this.

04:21.329 --> 04:24.329
Hey! Stop that! Put me down!

04:24.330 --> 04:27.199
Totally sorry, Princess.
If you'll just... Aah!

04:28.500 --> 04:30.909
Hey! That stings!

04:30.910 --> 04:32.535
This'll sting, too, Kamala.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.980
Ms. Marvel! Incoming!

04:39.371 --> 04:40.499
Well, I had him.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.529
Till I didn't.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.909
Just grab him, can't ya?

04:46.910 --> 04:50.580
Like it's that easy. Hello!
He's Black Panther!

04:57.200 --> 04:59.040
Shuri, be ready.

05:02.203 --> 05:04.159
Kamala!

05:04.160 --> 05:06.369
Aah!

05:06.370 --> 05:07.619
Come.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.870
I really am so sorry.

05:13.290 --> 05:15.039
Central Park?

05:15.040 --> 05:17.409
I made preparations after
the Atlantean attack

05:17.410 --> 05:20.239
in case the embassy was
compromised a second time.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.700
It seemed wise to have off-site
transportation at the ready.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.080
Sometimes your ideas
aren't half bad, brother.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.797
Look out! Aah!

05:43.910 --> 05:45.870
T'Challa! The jet!

05:48.659 --> 05:51.199
The jet is not the problem.

05:51.200 --> 05:54.119
Black Panther!

05:54.120 --> 05:59.910
Surrender now, traitor, or
face the wrath of Thor!

06:04.000 --> 06:06.789
This is not good.
Do you have a plan?

06:06.790 --> 06:10.739
I am forming one. You have your
prototypes with you, I presume.

06:10.740 --> 06:14.329
Yes, of course. I... Wh...
What? T'Challa, wait.

06:14.330 --> 06:17.119
Thor, do not attack.

06:17.120 --> 06:20.499
I wish to speak to you,
one royal to another.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.159
I must return the
Crown to Wakanda.

06:23.160 --> 06:27.119
If I do not, there will be
unimaginable destruction.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.159
You destroyed Captain America.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.329
You might make any claim
to avoid punishment.

06:33.330 --> 06:35.120
You will not let us pass?

06:36.580 --> 06:38.370
No.

06:38.373 --> 06:41.119
Your crime is too great.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.369
You must face justice!

06:43.370 --> 06:47.159
Then... it is decided.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.540
Hmph!

07:02.080 --> 07:03.619
Aahh!

07:03.620 --> 07:05.199
Shatter Ball. No.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.949
Stealth web. No.

07:06.950 --> 07:08.999
Micro battery... Aha!

07:09.000 --> 07:11.620
Yes! Power siphons!

07:14.081 --> 07:15.081
Aaah!

07:26.141 --> 07:27.199
Aah!

07:29.580 --> 07:31.370
This might sting a bit.

07:39.039 --> 07:42.346
Nicely done. Your power
siphons work very well.

07:45.077 --> 07:47.547
They haven't been tested on
a real Asgardian before.

07:47.548 --> 07:49.833
We don't know if they can
hold this energy for very...

07:49.834 --> 07:51.369
T'Challa!

07:54.200 --> 07:55.579
Aah!

08:06.380 --> 08:10.339
Well, now we know.
We... should go.

08:10.340 --> 08:12.339
One of us must get to the jet.

08:12.340 --> 08:15.339
Have you seen the jet?
It's not going to help us.

08:15.340 --> 08:19.129
You must trust me. The jet is hobbled,
but there are weapons inside.

08:19.130 --> 08:21.249
Weapons? What sort of...

08:21.250 --> 08:23.589
No! T'Challa, you didn't!

08:23.590 --> 08:25.539
Shuri, go!

08:25.540 --> 08:26.835
I will distract Thor.

08:28.130 --> 08:30.540
I can't believe I'm doing this!

08:32.799 --> 08:34.958
Hmm?

08:34.960 --> 08:37.419
Thor, please hear me.

08:37.419 --> 08:39.499
I am only trying to
protect the people of...

08:39.500 --> 08:42.210
Enough! No more talk!

08:46.960 --> 08:49.589
Your technology is formidable,

08:49.590 --> 08:52.500
but it can never match
Asgardian power!

08:58.870 --> 09:03.590
Wakandan technology is
a match for anything!

09:12.340 --> 09:14.210
Shuri, be ready!

09:15.920 --> 09:17.460
Panther!

09:26.040 --> 09:28.839
Thor, we can still stop this.

09:28.840 --> 09:30.839
Just put the hammer down!

09:32.135 --> 09:35.839
As... you... wish!

09:37.141 --> 09:38.157
Now!

09:44.620 --> 09:47.199
Huh! Another of your tricks.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.700
It will fail, like the rest.

09:55.982 --> 09:58.199
This is nothing.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.739
When will you learn that
your traps are useless?

10:01.740 --> 10:04.579
That is not the trap. This is.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.619
I can't believe you had

10:13.620 --> 10:15.869
a weapon designed
specifically to defeat Thor.

10:15.870 --> 10:18.199
It is only a temporary solution.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.235
We must go before he returns.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.829
We lost time. We lost the jet.

10:24.830 --> 10:26.499
The Vibranium's almost depleted.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.829
How are we going to make
it back to Wakanda?

10:28.830 --> 10:32.699
Shuri, an effective backup plan
requires a backup of its own.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.850
Come.

10:33.851 --> 10:34.999
T'Challa, wait.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.290
Where are we going?

10:41.620 --> 10:43.409
An empty warehouse?

10:43.410 --> 10:46.120
This is your backup backup plan?

10:54.200 --> 10:56.409
Honestly, when do
you find the time?

11:04.870 --> 11:08.949
Looks like you're having engine trouble.
So sad for you.

11:08.950 --> 11:10.869
Stand aside, Black Widow.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.699
Let us put our jet back together,
and we'll be on our way.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.579
You're absolutely
free to go, Princess,

11:16.580 --> 11:18.700
just as soon as your
brother surrenders.

11:18.703 --> 11:21.079
Why are you doing this, Natasha?

11:21.080 --> 11:23.409
You know I would never
harm Captain America.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.699
I know what I saw.

11:38.081 --> 11:39.499
Missing something?

11:51.580 --> 11:55.159
You don't happen to have another jet
hidden somewhere in New York, do you?

11:55.160 --> 11:58.199
Why do I ask? Of course you do.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.159
Isn't this where the Avengers wanted
to take you in the first place?

12:01.160 --> 12:04.200
I am fairly certain they did
not wish to bring me here.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.950
Hidden elevator? You
really have been busy.

12:10.670 --> 12:14.300
"No battle plan survives contact
with the enemy." Sun Tzu.

12:16.130 --> 12:20.170
"My brother's backup plans have
backup plans." Princess Shuri.

12:22.500 --> 12:26.089
Seriously? You hid a
jet in my trophy room?

12:26.090 --> 12:28.959
I'm starting to get the feeling
you never trusted any of us.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.459
Trust is a two-way road.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.539
Really? T'Challa, we don't
have time for this.

12:34.540 --> 12:36.130
I will be quick.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.709
Hey, wait!

12:56.141 --> 12:59.499
If this is how you treat your friends,
no wonder you've got so many enemies.

13:00.593 --> 13:02.749
We are not enemies!

13:02.750 --> 13:05.459
I know that. I just
said we're friends.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.380
T'Challa! Clear!

13:08.380 --> 13:10.380
Aah!

13:11.380 --> 13:13.000
That was quick.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.040
Okay. Now I'm mad!

13:40.000 --> 13:42.129
T'Challa? T'Challa,

13:42.130 --> 13:44.999
do you plan to say anything
before we get to Wakanda?

13:47.040 --> 13:51.169
I... I am sorry, Shuri.
I was thinking.

13:51.170 --> 13:52.710
Tell me.

13:52.711 --> 13:54.249
I prefer to remain silent.

13:54.250 --> 13:58.459
I'm your sister. I know
what troubles you.

13:58.460 --> 14:01.209
I know how much Captain
America meant to you.

14:01.210 --> 14:04.089
And now, being forced to
go against your friends...

14:04.090 --> 14:08.499
Sometimes doing our duty takes
a toll on our lives, Shuri.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.210
Another lesson on
how to be a king?

14:10.211 --> 14:11.919
Perhaps.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.629
Once this is all over, can we not
just explain to the Avengers?

14:15.630 --> 14:18.397
- Your friends will see...
- You call them my friends?

14:18.920 --> 14:20.630
I am not certain of that.

14:20.631 --> 14:22.339
They are your friends, T'Challa.

14:22.340 --> 14:24.339
If they are, they will forgive.

14:24.340 --> 14:26.709
You have a good heart, sister,

14:26.710 --> 14:29.839
but sentiment is a
luxury we cannot afford.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.459
If we do not get the
Crown back to Wakanda,

14:32.460 --> 14:35.039
it will destroy
millions of lives.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.129
Nothing else can matter now.

14:37.130 --> 14:40.540
Closing in on the African coast.
We might actually make it.

14:42.130 --> 14:45.129
Surprise! How do you like
my new stealth tech?

14:46.920 --> 14:49.670
Now, where were we?

14:51.840 --> 14:54.039
Did you really think you could
get away with this, T'Challa?

14:54.040 --> 14:56.039
I tried to reason with you.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.629
Your actions dictated
this course, not mine.

14:58.630 --> 15:01.629
I gave you a chance to
surrender at the embassy.

15:01.630 --> 15:03.799
This mess is all on you!

15:03.800 --> 15:07.539
You took Black Widow's word, yet
you did not even consider mine.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.299
Is that how you treat buddies?

15:09.300 --> 15:11.299
Whatever. I'm not here to argue.

15:11.300 --> 15:14.169
I'm here to bring you and that
Crown thing back to New York.

15:15.454 --> 15:16.654
So be it.

15:30.500 --> 15:34.130
Shuri, return to the capital.
Initiate the Shield protocol.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.960
T'Challa, stay alive.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.669
You can't beat me, T'Challa.

16:07.670 --> 16:09.089
Perhaps not.

16:09.090 --> 16:11.629
But beating you was
never my plan.

16:12.424 --> 16:14.173
Stopping you was.

16:22.630 --> 16:25.419
Hey! Hey! No! Stop that!
I need that!

16:25.420 --> 16:28.249
Yes, you do.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.669
The reactor's power will
continue to protect your heart,

16:35.670 --> 16:37.959
but its connection to
your armor is severed.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.669
Good-bye, Tony.

16:39.670 --> 16:41.669
Okay.

16:41.670 --> 16:44.000
That was actually a
pretty good plan.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.130
Time to hunt some big game.

16:58.247 --> 16:59.904
Aah!

17:08.089 --> 17:10.299
Neat trick, but
I've got some too.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.299
You are not getting away.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.260
Stay back, Hawkeye. I do
not wish to hurt you.

17:26.050 --> 17:28.219
Oh, we're way too late for that.

17:28.220 --> 17:30.339
This one's for Whitney Frost.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.618
And this one's for the Avengers!

17:37.470 --> 17:40.680
And this one is for Steve.

18:07.430 --> 18:09.340
I am almost to the border.

18:10.430 --> 18:12.260
That's far enough!

18:15.680 --> 18:17.839
Stay back. If you
pass this point,

18:17.840 --> 18:20.839
it will be viewed as a hostile
incursion into Wakanda.

18:20.840 --> 18:24.509
Did he just call us hostiles?
Ouch.

18:24.510 --> 18:27.889
We were friends, T'Challa.
Why are you doing this?

18:27.890 --> 18:31.260
Some things are more important than
friendship. You should know that.

18:33.390 --> 18:36.340
Final warning, Panther.
One more step...

18:46.220 --> 18:48.969
T'Challa, you must hurry.
The Crown is...

18:48.970 --> 18:53.549
Be calm, Shuri. Returning the Crown
to Wakanda has stabilized it.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.469
The danger is passed.

18:55.470 --> 18:57.469
Not for you.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.929
Is this how you solve
your problems?

18:59.930 --> 19:03.299
It doesn't always have to be Wakanda
versus the rest of the world, you know.

19:03.300 --> 19:06.339
There was a time when I
believed that to be true.

19:06.340 --> 19:09.049
I defied the wisdom
of my forefathers,

19:09.050 --> 19:12.839
opened our border, joined
forces with the Avengers.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.839
But your minds are closed.

19:14.840 --> 19:17.179
You will not hear me.

19:17.180 --> 19:20.429
I thank you for making it clear
that my ancestors were correct.

19:20.430 --> 19:22.839
Wakanda stands alone
in the world.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.430
I must stand alone.

19:33.640 --> 19:38.219
Once again, the borders of Wakanda
are closed to all foreigners.

19:38.220 --> 19:41.839
Any attempt by you or
anyone else to cross

19:41.840 --> 19:45.930
will be seen as an act of war
and punished accordingly.

20:06.010 --> 20:09.219
You're right. It's
completely inert.

20:09.220 --> 20:12.339
Klaue told the truth about it
being safe on Wakandan soil?

20:12.340 --> 20:16.429
It seems so. As soon as I crossed our
border, the energy build-up ceased.

20:16.430 --> 20:18.429
That sounds like magic.

20:18.430 --> 20:21.219
There must be a
scientific explanation.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.639
We'll keep working on it.
You should rest.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.430
It's been a bad day.

20:32.050 --> 20:35.219
T'Challa, have you been
out here this whole time?

20:35.220 --> 20:37.339
I have teams
examining the Crown.

20:37.340 --> 20:39.389
It has many unexpected
properties,

20:39.390 --> 20:42.339
but it does seem to be a new form
of Vibranium, as Klaue said.

20:42.340 --> 20:45.599
Or a very old one. I think...

20:45.600 --> 20:49.220
T'Challa? Are you all right?

20:50.760 --> 20:54.219
I... I am not certain.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.009
This quest has
shattered friendships

20:56.010 --> 20:58.509
and alliances I've
spent years forging.

20:58.510 --> 21:00.509
For what?

21:00.510 --> 21:04.219
For Wakanda. We saved the world.

21:04.220 --> 21:06.679
Even if the Avengers
don't know it.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.490
That is true.

21:08.491 --> 21:10.299
We did what was right.

21:10.300 --> 21:13.799
You did what was right. It's
what Father taught us to do.

21:13.800 --> 21:17.219
Father taught me to plan
everything to the finest detail,

21:17.220 --> 21:21.299
to prepare for any circumstance
I might encounter as king.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.719
But this?

21:23.720 --> 21:26.929
For the first time in my life,

21:26.930 --> 21:29.140
I have no plan.
