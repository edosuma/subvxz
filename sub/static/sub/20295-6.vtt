-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.167 --> 00:36.233
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.800
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.833 --> 00:41.767
in a court of law.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.867
-I've been
with the Lubbock Police
Department since 2003,

00:44.900 --> 00:46.900
so coming on my 13th year.

00:46.933 --> 00:49.700
And I'm assigned
to the Crime Suppression Unit.

00:49.733 --> 00:52.300
The Crime Suppression Unit
for the Lubbock Police
Department is pretty much

00:52.333 --> 00:55.900
an all-inclusive unit.
If it's drugs, we handle it,

00:55.933 --> 00:57.367
if it's thefts,
we'll deal with it.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.500
More of an on-view
street crimes type unit.

01:01.533 --> 01:05.167
We get out and find the things
that are appearing in daily
day-to-day life

01:05.200 --> 01:06.933
here in Lubbock.

01:06.967 --> 01:09.567
We got a call
from a bail bondsman
there's a bail jumper

01:09.600 --> 01:10.967
that's got warrants out
for his arrest--

01:11.067 --> 01:14.167
was in this parking lot.
We're trying to find him now.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.267
I believe he's out on foot here.

01:17.300 --> 01:20.500
All right, he's in the alley,
I think, behind Accolade
Home Health.

01:20.533 --> 01:23.467
Ooh, can I get through there,
can I get through there?

01:26.567 --> 01:28.500
(radio chatter)

01:28.533 --> 01:31.867
Yeah, I'm tryin' to get
back around, traffic's
not helpin'.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.700
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

01:34.733 --> 01:36.167
-Officer on radio:
Hey, I'll be right there.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.633
He's runnin'.

01:44.067 --> 01:45.667
-Officer on radio:
Where's he at?

01:51.667 --> 01:53.767
-You better stop!

01:53.800 --> 01:57.067
-(radio chatter)

01:58.533 --> 02:02.067
-Stop!
Get your hands up!

02:02.067 --> 02:03.367
Get your hands up!

02:03.400 --> 02:06.900
Get on the ground!
Do it now! Do exactly
as I tell you to!

02:06.933 --> 02:09.400
Do not move!

02:09.433 --> 02:13.067
-What did I do, though, sir?

02:13.100 --> 02:16.067
-I got a warrant
for your arrest.
Don't fight me.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.600
You hear me?
-Yeah.

02:20.167 --> 02:23.400
-...Hastings.

02:23.433 --> 02:26.267
-If you can get off the radio,
I'm in the alley behind
Accolade Home Health.

02:26.300 --> 02:27.467
I got him down.

02:39.233 --> 02:42.900
-You got him?
-I got him in custody.

02:44.433 --> 02:46.800
You got anything else
on you?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.833
-No, sir.

02:48.867 --> 02:53.600
-All right, sit up.
Hey... buddy,
when you got a warrant

02:53.633 --> 02:55.833
don't run from me.
Just, just get it over with.

02:55.867 --> 02:57.500
You got the warrant,
you earned it, okay?

02:57.533 --> 02:59.533
Okay?

02:59.567 --> 03:01.967
So... turn around
and face that wall for me.

03:02.067 --> 03:03.900
-What kind of warrants
do I got?

03:03.933 --> 03:05.633
I was just told
you had three felony warrants,

03:05.667 --> 03:07.767
so I don't know
if they revoked your parole...
-Felony warrants?

03:07.800 --> 03:10.533
or what it is, so...
-I don't have felonies,
they're misdemeanors.

03:10.567 --> 03:13.733
-So... it didn't help
that you just ran from us, okay?

03:13.767 --> 03:16.433
That, that'll, that'll mess up
your bond chances.

03:16.467 --> 03:19.067
-(mumbling)

03:19.067 --> 03:21.333
-So...
-Nah, they're misdemeanors, sir.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.367
-Okay, I don't know.
Like I said, I'm told
you have warrants,

03:23.400 --> 03:25.333
I'm goin'-- I gotta go get ya.
-Yes, sir.

03:25.367 --> 03:28.100
-All right. So I'm sorry
I ruined your day,
but that's just the way it goes.

03:29.533 --> 03:31.700
You still usin'...
every now and then?

03:31.733 --> 03:34.400
Yeah, y'are.

03:34.433 --> 03:37.067
(sighs) Man.

03:37.100 --> 03:39.067
-That's just trash.

03:39.067 --> 03:43.100
-Not in the real world it's not.
I mean, maybe in your world,
but that's...

03:43.133 --> 03:46.333
I think it might be molly.
-Molly?

03:46.367 --> 03:50.567
-Not Ecstasy and that
mixed together, what is it?

03:52.800 --> 03:55.167
Hey... Gus.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.133
-Heroin, heroin.

03:57.167 --> 04:00.900
-I don't think it's heroin.
I think it might be molly.

04:00.933 --> 04:03.367
-Molly.
-It's not molly, though,
and it's not heroin.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.567
-Okay. Well, like I said,
I don't see-- you don't see
much stuff

04:05.600 --> 04:07.700
looks like brown sugar
except for heroin.

04:07.733 --> 04:09.467
-Yeah?
-So...

04:09.500 --> 04:12.733
-I don't mess with heroin.
-Okay. Well, I don't know.

04:12.767 --> 04:15.100
You got anything else
gonna get you in trouble
at the jail?

04:15.133 --> 04:16.200
-No, sir.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.100
-All right.

04:18.133 --> 04:20.800
-So...
-Looks bright orange.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.833
-Bright orange.
-Amphetamine.

04:22.867 --> 04:26.300
-That means it's positive
for methamphetamines.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.067
So...

04:29.700 --> 04:32.333
-You been followin' me
for a while?
-Yeah, we been tryin'

04:32.367 --> 04:34.100
to catch you for a couple days.
-Okay.

04:37.533 --> 04:41.067
-Ninety, hundred...
-He has a thing about numbers,
he has to count everything.

04:41.067 --> 04:44.067
-(chuckling)
-Whoops.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.600
-Oh. Hang on.

04:46.633 --> 04:50.700
Hey. That ain't real.
-That's funny money.

04:50.733 --> 04:54.067
-Where'd you get this?
-Where'd you get funny money?

04:54.067 --> 04:56.700
-I just got that
from Hastings, sir.

04:56.733 --> 04:58.333
-You didn't
get that from Hastings.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.267
-I promise you, I don't get
funny money.
-Come on, dude, look at that.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.667
-That is-- that is the worst...
-No. No, no, that is not mine.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.400
-That is the worst fifty
I've ever seen.
There's no watermark

05:05.433 --> 05:06.567
or anything in that.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.400
-Man, my problem with that
is that's where...

05:08.433 --> 05:10.700
-That stays with me.
-...I just barely got that.
I didn't have no fifties

05:10.733 --> 05:12.467
until I turned that stuff in.
-That goes to the bank.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.067
-I know, but I'm not
giving it back to him.
-Man.

05:15.067 --> 05:17.767
-You all right?
-Yeah, see, it's not...

05:17.800 --> 05:19.767
-That's not mine, seriously.
-It's not even normal size.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.067
-I mean, well, you know,
I got it from Hastings,
I didn't have it...

05:22.067 --> 05:24.133
-Okay, all right. Slide up
in this car, big guy.
-Yes, sir.

05:24.167 --> 05:27.567
-What'd you buy at Hastings?
-I re-- returned gift cards.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.900
I sold the gift cards to them
and they gave me cash back
for it.

05:29.933 --> 05:32.067
I got the receipts
right here in my pocket.
-Okay.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.767
All right,
this is the bail bondsman

05:33.800 --> 05:35.700
that's
been lookin' for you, okay?

05:35.733 --> 05:37.233
All right, you recognize him?

05:37.267 --> 05:38.867
Okay.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.600
All right, you know why
we're chasin' you, then.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.100
You jumped on Ace Bail Bonds.

05:45.133 --> 05:47.900
-I know.
-Okay? You're goin'
on do not bond list

05:47.933 --> 05:51.933
all over Lubbock.
Everybody in town already knows
not to touch you.

05:51.967 --> 05:55.400
Your co-signer
is still on the hook
for the money that you owe us.

05:55.433 --> 05:58.067
-What was his bond for?
What charge?

05:58.100 --> 06:02.933
-I've got him on a red light,
possession of paraphernalia,
a DWI, issuance of a bad check,

06:02.967 --> 06:07.900
evade arrest,
and a felony theft.
-Okay.

06:07.933 --> 06:09.800
There you go. I guess
they upped your theft
to a felony.

06:09.833 --> 06:12.800
That's the felony
we're hearing.
-Damn!

06:12.833 --> 06:16.933
That's my-- that's a-- okay.
-D-- i-i-it may not have been
a felony at the time,

06:16.967 --> 06:19.800
but if you have priors,
they up it.
They'll enhance it.

06:19.833 --> 06:23.267
-That was like...
from a second one...
-Okay, well, it does enhance it,

06:23.300 --> 06:24.900
even if it's just
a second one, okay?
-Oh.

06:24.933 --> 06:27.833
From the first one on,
every time you do it again,
it bumps it up, so...

06:27.867 --> 06:32.100
so if you had a state
jail felony, it bumps it
to a third degree,and so on.

06:32.133 --> 06:34.633
You know,
and you caught an extra charge
this day 'cause you ran.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.367
If you hadn't a ran.
-I was...

06:36.400 --> 06:40.233
-I know. You gotta try, right?
That's what everybody tells me,
"I gotta try."

06:40.267 --> 06:42.667
All right, man, we'll get you
out there and get you
booked in, okay?

06:42.700 --> 06:43.700
-Cool.
-All right.

06:45.067 --> 06:46.467
So...

06:46.500 --> 06:49.300
He like a caged animal,
he tried to jump this one,

06:49.333 --> 06:51.567
and then he tried
to jump that one.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.200
But he picked the fence
that's like 12-foot tall
and couldn't get over it.

06:54.233 --> 06:57.067
Thank the neighbors
for big, tall fences.

07:01.233 --> 07:03.967
-I love doin' DUI enforcement
out here. It's kind of become
my niche.

07:04.067 --> 07:06.167
It's somethin' I'm good at,
and it brings me satisfaction

07:06.200 --> 07:08.533
to know
I'm makin' the roads safer
for everybody out here.

07:08.567 --> 07:10.567
Um, it's also nice
to be recognized.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.800
I've been recognized
three years in a row

07:12.833 --> 07:14.967
by Mothers Against Drunk Driving
for the work we're doing
out here

07:15.067 --> 07:16.433
to make the roads safer.

07:16.467 --> 07:20.767
-(radio chatter)

07:24.333 --> 07:27.467
-His vehicle just passed us
like we were standing still.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.700
He's probably doing 60
in a 45, he's all over
the roadway.

07:30.733 --> 07:33.133
Almost hit the curb back there.

07:33.167 --> 07:35.533
I'm gonna follow him
for a minute here.

07:35.567 --> 07:38.267
See if we can get
a driving pattern.

07:41.867 --> 07:48.500
-(radio chatter)

07:48.533 --> 07:52.633
-(radio chatter)

07:59.133 --> 08:02.800
-(radio chatter)

08:04.800 --> 08:08.667
-Yeah, she is all over the road,
back and forth, lane to lane,

08:08.700 --> 08:12.567
changin' lanes,
stoppin' way before she has to.

08:12.600 --> 08:17.267
We get past this construction
up here, I'm gonna go ahead
and do a traffic stop.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.533
Not a good place
to stop her right here.

08:22.833 --> 08:26.300
5711, 1050.
-Come in, 5711, go ahead.

08:26.333 --> 08:29.933
-Be at Swift and Bee Ridge.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.400
-(radio chatter)

08:34.733 --> 08:39.300
-(radio chatter)

08:43.433 --> 08:45.600
-Hi, good evening.

08:45.633 --> 08:46.733
-Hey, how are you?

08:46.767 --> 08:48.100
-Good. Deputy Adams
of the Sheriff's office.

08:48.133 --> 08:49.400
Do you have any idea
why I stopped you?

08:49.433 --> 08:51.333
-Yeah.
-Okay, why?

08:51.367 --> 08:56.200
-'Cause I was going, uh,
out of the speed limit.

08:56.233 --> 08:58.667
-Yeah, you were speeding,
I was doing 45,
and you passed me

08:58.700 --> 09:01.800
like I was standing still,
but you're all over the roadway,

09:01.833 --> 09:03.200
back and forth, in and out
of your lane.

09:03.233 --> 09:04.367
Are you feelin' okay today?

09:04.400 --> 09:06.067
-Yeah, okay, I understand.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.933
-You're feelin' all right?
-Yeah.

09:07.967 --> 09:09.400
-All right, how much
you had to drink today?

09:09.433 --> 09:11.867
-Um, not a lot,
I had two drinks,

09:11.900 --> 09:14.500
and I'm sure
I'm above the limit.

09:14.533 --> 09:16.867
-You're above the limit?
Okay, let me ask you
a question,

09:16.900 --> 09:19.067
on a scale of zero to 10,
zero being stone cold sober,

09:19.100 --> 09:22.233
and 10 being passed out drunk,
where do you think you're at
right now?

09:22.267 --> 09:24.900
-Five.
-About a five?
About halfway there?

09:24.933 --> 09:27.267
Okay, where are you headed
right now, ma'am?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.067
Well, I'm going
to my friend's house.

09:29.067 --> 09:32.400
and I was going there
to stay the night, so...

09:32.433 --> 09:35.500
-Okay, do you have a license
and registration and proof
of insurance with you?

09:35.533 --> 09:38.367
-Absolutely.
-Okay, can you
grab that for me, please?

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
-Not a problem.

09:40.433 --> 09:43.600
-5711, routine 1094.
10-4, 10-6.

09:43.633 --> 09:48.200
-I don't have that, like,
with me, but...
-You don't have it with you?

09:48.233 --> 09:51.300
-No.
-Okay. If you find it,
just hold it out the window

09:51.333 --> 09:52.733
and let me know,
I'll be back with you

09:52.767 --> 09:55.300
in just a few moments,
okay, ma'am?
-Okay, great, thanks.

09:57.400 --> 10:01.333
-She's shown
multiple indicators
of impairment,

10:01.367 --> 10:02.967
I can smell it,
I can see it in her eyes.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.733
Um... she says
that she's... about halfway

10:05.767 --> 10:09.033
to being completely passed out
drunk. Um, so...

10:09.067 --> 10:12.300
we've got another unit
comin'. When backup arrives,

10:12.333 --> 10:14.100
we're gonna go ahead
and do an investigation

10:14.133 --> 10:16.333
to see whether or not
she made a good choice
by driving.

10:16.367 --> 10:18.067
Hey, Ben.
-What's goin' on?

10:18.100 --> 10:19.767
-You got the unmarked car.
-Yeah.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.167
-We're northbound on 41,
she sucks the paint off
the side of my car.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.800
(whooshing sound)
Right by me... cuts over
in front of me

10:25.833 --> 10:29.233
almost hits the curb
and the median,
goes back over to the right,

10:29.267 --> 10:31.167
almost hits another car
in that lane
and then corrects it,

10:31.200 --> 10:33.533
and she's been that way
all the way up 41
to Bee Ridge,

10:33.567 --> 10:36.500
she turned down Bee Ridge.
The same-- same behavior...
-Mm-hmm.

10:36.533 --> 10:38.067
line to line to line to line...
-Mm-hmm.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.967
Pull her over.
She says... she's a five
on a scale of zero to ten.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.233
So... we need to get her out
and do an investigation,

10:44.267 --> 10:46.133
and make sure nobody else
cuts through here...
-Yeah.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.767
-So... thanks.
-You got it.

10:48.867 --> 10:51.500
-All right, step out here
for a second.

10:51.533 --> 10:54.967
-You make sure that she comes
to pick me up and take me
to her home.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.167
-Okay. All right.
Do you mind
if I shut your door here?

10:58.200 --> 11:00.067
-Mm, that's no problem.

11:00.067 --> 11:02.667
-Okay. What I'm gonna
have you do is just stand
right over here in front of me,

11:02.700 --> 11:05.067
just this side of that line.
Put your feet together
so your heels--

11:05.100 --> 11:07.167
Come this side of that line
for me...
-All right.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.067
put your feet together
so your heels and toes
are touching

11:09.100 --> 11:10.433
-Sure.
-and keep your hands
by your side

11:10.467 --> 11:12.100
-Uh-huh.
-And you remember
to watch the green light

11:12.133 --> 11:13.567
and don't move your head, okay?
-No problem.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.700
-Look right up here at the tip
of the green light for me.
-Okay.

11:15.733 --> 11:20.367
-Right now, Deputy Adams
is checking horizontal gaze
nystagmus, and what he's doin'

11:20.400 --> 11:22.067
is, whenever
you consume alcohol,

11:22.067 --> 11:26.233
the-- the eyes
have a, a jerking motion,

11:26.267 --> 11:28.267
depending on the amount
that you've consumed.

11:30.367 --> 11:33.433
The vertical nystagmus
that he's lookin' for now

11:33.467 --> 11:38.233
is for the higher end
of the spectrum
when it comes to impairment.

11:38.267 --> 11:41.967
Only the higher blood alcohol
levels are gonna have vertical.

11:42.067 --> 11:45.533
-Okay. When I tell you
to begin,

11:45.567 --> 11:47.300
you're
gonna take nine continuous
heel-to-toe steps

11:47.333 --> 11:49.800
down that line
while counting your steps
out loud.

11:49.833 --> 11:53.700
Take your first step
with your left foot
as one... okay?

11:53.733 --> 11:55.200
Do you understand
all those instructions?

11:55.233 --> 11:56.833
-I do.
-All right, you may begin.

11:56.867 --> 12:00.500
-Okay? One...
-As she's walking,
he's looking to see

12:00.533 --> 12:04.367
if she steps off the line,
if she uses her arm, arms
for balance,

12:04.400 --> 12:05.700
if she doesn't touch
heel to toe.

12:05.733 --> 12:09.833
That's gonna be
for the first nine steps
down the line.

12:09.867 --> 12:14.367
He's gonna see if she turns
the way that he instructed...

12:14.400 --> 12:16.533
Sheriff Adams:
Just do the best you can
and finish the exercise.

12:16.567 --> 12:18.367
-and uh, things like that.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.700
-Both of your feet
should be on that line.

12:20.733 --> 12:22.300
Right in the middle
of that line.

12:22.333 --> 12:26.533
-Was that... was that
what you were asking me to do?
-No ma'am... no.

12:26.567 --> 12:28.633
All right, go ahead
and put your hands
behind your back, miss.

12:28.667 --> 12:31.833
Unfortunately, at this point,
I have to place you under arrest
for a DUI.

12:31.867 --> 12:34.667
Okay, I think
you made a bad choice
by driving today.

12:34.700 --> 12:37.200
I know you were trying
to get to your friend's house
and be done for the day,

12:37.233 --> 12:40.700
but, probably... probably
should've taken a cab
or somethin' to do that.

12:40.733 --> 12:42.433
Okay?
-(inaudible)

12:42.467 --> 12:45.233
Once we get down to the jail,
I'm gonna ask you
to take a breath test.

12:45.267 --> 12:46.267
will you take a breath test?

12:48.533 --> 12:52.067
-I'm
gonna think about my position
-Okay... absolutely.

12:52.067 --> 12:54.800
-and when we get down
to the jail, then
I'm gonna answer you

12:54.833 --> 12:56.767
-at that point in time.
-Absolutely.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.867
-Okay.
-Do you have anything
in your pockets, sharp,

12:58.900 --> 13:01.300
or that's gonna poke me, miss?
-Definitely not.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.433
-Okay. We're gonna go back here
to my patrol car, okay?
-Sure.

13:04.467 --> 13:06.200
-Walk right over here for me.
-Uh-huh.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.133
-Watch your head.

13:09.167 --> 13:12.900
Luckily, based on the way
she was driving, she didn't hit
or kill anybody.

13:12.933 --> 13:15.267
We were in the right place
at the right time,

13:15.300 --> 13:18.100
and she'll be going down
to the jail for at least
eight hours.

13:21.867 --> 13:24.067
You know,
been doing law enforcement now
for about 13 years.

13:24.067 --> 13:25.567
Best job in the world.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.200
Officer safety is paramount.
Number one rule, obviously,

13:28.233 --> 13:29.700
go home at the end of the day.

13:29.733 --> 13:32.700
It's different from
bein' a fireman,
but you do help people

13:32.733 --> 13:34.300
That's a big part of this job.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.867
They just think
we take people to jail.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.133
We help people every single day
out here.

13:38.167 --> 13:39.767
-(radio chatter)

13:39.800 --> 13:43.233
-We're heading to a battery call
at one of the hotels.

13:43.267 --> 13:45.433
A male subject
said that he was assaulted

13:45.467 --> 13:47.900
by his girlfriend.
-(radio chatter)

13:47.933 --> 13:50.533
-This is it right here.

13:50.567 --> 13:53.067
-(radio chatter)

13:54.333 --> 13:57.400
-Step out here real quick.
What's goin' on, man?

13:57.433 --> 14:01.200
-Well, she got a little upset
about me. I don't know what
she got upset about exactly.

14:01.233 --> 14:03.167
-Uh-huh.
-All I know,
a beer can hit me in the head.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.900
I just cleaned all that beer up.
I've asked her to leave.

14:05.933 --> 14:08.933
Then she put her hands on me
again...
-You don't need EMS

14:08.967 --> 14:10.533
or anything, do you?
-No, no, no, I'm good, man.

14:10.567 --> 14:13.667
-What's y'all's relationship?
-We're girlfriend and boyfriend.

14:13.700 --> 14:16.600
-Okay. Y'all live together?
-No. We're not at this point,
we just-- you know,

14:16.633 --> 14:19.600
I, I got us a room.
-Just for the weekend.

14:19.633 --> 14:21.767
-Yeah, for the weekend
and stuff.
-Yeah, okay, I got you, man.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.800
So you guys
don't have no kids together
or nothin' like that?

14:23.833 --> 14:25.267
-No, no.
-Y'all aren't livin' together?

14:25.300 --> 14:26.433
-No, sir.
-Okay. Okay.

14:26.467 --> 14:27.967
-Stuff just escalated, man.
-Hey, do me a favor.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.867
Step over here real quick.
I'm gonna keep that door open,

14:29.900 --> 14:31.767
and I'm gonna make sure
you ain't got nothin'
on you, man.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.900
We got a dangerous job
out here, my man.
-That's cool.

14:33.933 --> 14:35.167
Woman:
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

14:35.200 --> 14:36.867
-I'll talk to you in a minute,
just sit on the bed.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.233
Okay, I want you to hang out
right here.

14:38.267 --> 14:40.433
Okay, what's your name, ma'am?
-Joy.

14:40.467 --> 14:43.833
-Hey, Joy... how much
you had to drink today?
-About four beers.

14:43.867 --> 14:46.333
-Okay. So make sure you guys
can get along rest
of the evening.

14:46.367 --> 14:49.300
Anybody ever been arrested
in Escambia County, you
or the gentleman?

14:49.333 --> 14:50.833
-Me? Have I ever been arrested?
-Have you?

14:50.867 --> 14:52.433
-One time.
-What about him?

14:52.467 --> 14:54.833
-He's... yeah, yes, sir,
I think s--, yeah,
he's been arrested.

14:54.867 --> 14:59.100
-Anything for domestic violence?
-I don't know, you'd have
to ask him about that.

14:59.133 --> 15:01.300
-Okay,
nothin' with you guys, though.
-But we were fine,

15:01.333 --> 15:03.400
we're chat-- we were chatting,
I mean...

15:03.433 --> 15:05.367
-What's bad enough
for him to call 9-1-1,

15:05.400 --> 15:06.967
a man,
talk about a woman hittin' him?

15:07.067 --> 15:09.700
-Because, we know
when you drink alcohol,
everything seems more intense

15:09.733 --> 15:11.733
than what it really is?
-Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

15:11.767 --> 15:13.633
-Yeah. That's why you gotta
be careful with it.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.700
-And everything
seems a lot worse
than what it really is.

15:15.733 --> 15:16.967
-And it's all--
Hey, have a good time.

15:17.067 --> 15:19.133
But I'm sayin'...
this ain't fun.
-Right.

15:19.167 --> 15:22.667
-Y'all got anything in here
I need to be worried about?
-No, sir. We don't do drugs.

15:22.700 --> 15:26.133
We just been drinkin'
too many beers. I don't know
what his (bleep) problem is.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.333
he's
got a attitude problem today.
-Okay.

15:28.367 --> 15:29.800
Hey, Joy?
Come out here real quick.

15:29.833 --> 15:31.300
I just wanna get a little more
from him.

15:31.333 --> 15:34.067
-I haven't been arg--
she's arguin'
with herself, basically,

15:34.067 --> 15:36.733
'cause I was just sittin'
at the chair, with my feet
kicked up...

15:36.767 --> 15:38.733
-Okay.
-And uh, you know,
not payin' attention to her,

15:38.767 --> 15:40.600
I guess, made it even more,
'cause I was like,

15:40.633 --> 15:42.733
I don't wanna argue, Joy,
I'm just gonna ignore you.
-Right.

15:42.767 --> 15:46.233
-You know,
and she got even more mad
about that,

15:46.267 --> 15:48.600
and that's when she was like,
okay, you ain't gonna
pay attention to me?

15:48.633 --> 15:50.600
She chucked a beer can at me.
-Gotcha.

15:50.633 --> 15:52.900
-You know...
-And did it-- it struck you
in the head?

15:52.933 --> 15:55.667
-Yeah, it grazed me
on the back of the head.
-Okay.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.167
-And uh... I say, okay.
That's enough.
All right, I'm mad.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.900
You need to go,
you need to leave.

16:00.067 --> 16:01.700
I just asked her
to leave, politely.

16:01.733 --> 16:03.600
-Right, 'cause it was gettin'
to that point
where it's getting violent,

16:03.633 --> 16:05.067
at that point.
-Yeah, exactly, I was like...

16:05.100 --> 16:06.800
-Okay.
-you need to leave.
I said this is my room,

16:06.833 --> 16:08.733
so I prefer you to leave.
-Right.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.900
-But then she came again...
and, when I was sittin'
in the chair,

16:10.933 --> 16:13.967
not payin' attention again,
kinda like, slap me
in the back of the head,

16:14.067 --> 16:15.167
and roughed me up, like.
-Okay.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.900
-And then I was like,
man, I'm tired of this,

16:16.933 --> 16:18.400
you're
not gonna keep hittin' me,

16:18.433 --> 16:20.067
you're not gonna coax me
into hittin' you, either.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.767
'Cause I'm not fallin' for that.
-Right.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.533
-I'm not, I'm not--
that's, you know,
I ain't doin' that no more.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.667
-Okay. Good for you.
Be patient with me
just a second.

16:25.700 --> 16:28.600
Ma'am, did you
throw a beer bottle and hit him?
-Yeah, I threw it.

16:28.633 --> 16:30.933
I don't know what it hit,
but yes, sir, I did throw,

16:30.967 --> 16:34.267
um, uh, not a bottle,
it was a can.
A can.

16:34.300 --> 16:37.700
-Okay, why would he call--
-I'm not a violent person,
I'm not tryin' to hurt--

16:37.733 --> 16:40.367
-What I'm sayin' is--
-I'm not tryin' to hurt nobody.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.367
-Talk to me. Talk to me.
What I'm sayin' is,
it's bad enough

16:42.400 --> 16:48.067
for a grown man to call 9-1-1.
To call 9-1-1 is pretty serious,
don't you think?

16:48.067 --> 16:50.500
No, baby no, I can't hurt him.
-I didn't say...

16:50.533 --> 16:52.867
-If I try, if I tried
to hurt him, I couldn't.
-Well, listen,

16:52.900 --> 16:55.167
-here's what concerns me,
though.
-It was a can, a can of beer.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.700
-You guys have a history
of domestic violence.
-A mini-can, a mini, mini-can,

16:57.733 --> 16:59.100
a mini-can of beer.
-You threw it.

16:59.133 --> 17:00.967
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

17:01.067 --> 17:04.533
Justin, keep an eye on him,
she's 1015. Could you
put your cigarette out for me?

17:04.567 --> 17:06.233
-Officer...
-Put your cigarette out for me.

17:06.267 --> 17:08.400
-Can we talk for a minute?
-Nope, you're under arrest
for battery.

17:08.433 --> 17:10.567
-Officer, no, I was...
-Ma'am, you're resistin' arrest
right now.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.800
Officer, I haven't done
nothing wrong.

17:12.833 --> 17:14.733
-Ma'am, you're goin' to jail,
it's domestic--

17:14.767 --> 17:16.633
-I didn't even hit him
with a can.
-It's domestic battery.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.100
-Okay. Put your cigarette out.
-No, I was
just gonna tell you...

17:19.133 --> 17:23.067
-Put your cigarette out,
put it out. Put it out.
-Oh, my god.

17:23.067 --> 17:26.733
(sobbing)
-Stand up. Stand up.
Stand up.

17:26.767 --> 17:30.067
Put your cigarette out for me.
I don't wanna get burned.
Stand up.

17:30.067 --> 17:31.533
Come on. Stand up.

17:31.567 --> 17:34.700
-Why am I goin' to jail,
for what? 'Cause I'm drunk?
-Nope.

17:34.733 --> 17:38.667
-Because I had too many beers
or what?
-Officer... please.

17:38.700 --> 17:42.833
Kevin, stop it. Kevin!

17:42.867 --> 17:45.400
Don't take me to jail!
-Hey, Justin? Do you mind
transportin' her?

17:45.433 --> 17:46.800
-Stand up and walk like a lady,
all right?

17:46.833 --> 17:48.633
-Baby, I'm beggin' you,
please, Kevin?

17:48.667 --> 17:51.867
No...
-Don't jerk away.
Stand up!

17:53.400 --> 17:55.967
(sobbing, incoherent)

17:56.067 --> 17:58.067
-Goddamn it!
-Stop, stop.

17:58.100 --> 18:01.233
-Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Okay, yes, sir.

18:01.267 --> 18:03.067
I'm gonna...
-Don't pull away from me!

18:03.067 --> 18:07.467
-Kevin!
-Ma'am, listen.
This is not gonna work.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.633
-Kevin!
-Come on, now, you're grown up.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.800
-I didn't do nothin'.
-You're grown up, it's time
to go.

18:11.833 --> 18:13.700
-Kevin! Kevin!
-Stop! Stop!

18:13.733 --> 18:15.667
-Oh, god...
-Ma'am, listen.

18:15.700 --> 18:18.967
-Kevin!
-Stop! Come on, come on.
Ma'am, this is...

18:19.067 --> 18:24.167
Ma'am, this is not gonna work.
This is not gonna work.
-No... no, no!

18:24.200 --> 18:27.167
-You don't need to do this.
Come on! Come on!
-Stop! No!

18:27.200 --> 18:29.100
-Ma'am!
-No! No!

18:29.133 --> 18:31.467
-Hey!
-Just... open that door up,
I got, I got her.

18:31.500 --> 18:35.400
-No! No! Baby...
-We'll hobble...
we'll hobble her if we have to.

18:35.433 --> 18:37.800
-Please... Kevin!
-Ma'am, stand up!

18:37.833 --> 18:39.200
-Kevin!
-Ma'am, stand up!

18:39.233 --> 18:41.067
-Kevin!
-You're causin' a scene.
This is ridiculous.

18:41.100 --> 18:44.667
-No! No! No!

18:44.700 --> 18:48.367
No, don't take me to jail.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.433
-Hey, kick my car again...
-I haven't done anything.

18:50.467 --> 18:54.500
-No. Don't take me to jail.
-Stop. Stop!

18:54.533 --> 18:58.233
-I haven't done anything.
-Stop. Listen I want you
to act like an adult.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.533
-I'm not going to act
like an adult.

19:00.567 --> 19:03.100
-Well, we're going to have
to hobble you if you kick
and do all that stuff.

19:03.133 --> 19:04.867
-Officer, please give me
a break right now.

19:04.900 --> 19:07.133
I promise you I didn't try
to, you know---

19:07.167 --> 19:09.267
I'm not a mean person. I can't--
I didn't mean to hit--

19:09.300 --> 19:10.967
I wasn't trying to hit him.

19:11.067 --> 19:14.067
-Okay. Well, the state--
the state's pressing charges.

19:14.067 --> 19:15.867
-I'm begging you.
I'm begging you right now.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.433
-It's domestic violence, ma'am.
My hands are tied on this.
-I'm begging you, please.

19:18.467 --> 19:20.367
-Ma'am, I can't.
-Yes, you can.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.933
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.

19:21.967 --> 19:23.500
-Something I cannot do is that.
-Yes, you can.

19:23.533 --> 19:26.433
-You're just being charged with
battery domestic violence, okay?

19:26.467 --> 19:28.767
-Officer, I-- I--
-Okay, scoot in.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.067
Scoot in. I don't want
to hurt your legs, okay?

19:31.067 --> 19:32.800
It's gonna work out
for the best.

19:32.833 --> 19:34.267
I promise you, okay?

19:34.300 --> 19:35.700
It's unfortunate she had to go--
-Yeah.

19:35.733 --> 19:38.400
-But maybe this will be
a positive thing for her
in the end,

19:38.433 --> 19:40.133
'cause alcohol was an issue.
-Exactly.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.633
-And it was getting worse.
-She wants to stop.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.233
-And you made
very good judgment.

19:44.267 --> 19:48.133
And, um, that old stigma
of a woman can hit a man
doesn't suffice here.

19:48.167 --> 19:49.967
We have zero tolerance.

19:50.067 --> 19:51.600
-Officer over radio:
132 and Bush.

19:51.633 --> 19:52.933
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.967 --> 19:55.067
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:55.067 --> 19:56.067
Cover is code three.

19:56.100 --> 20:00.033
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.433 --> 20:07.433
-Dispatcher:
Okay, still send a code three.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.967
-(theme music playing)
