But the Lord done put helium
under my feet,

11:28.655 --> 11:30.890
and I must not spill it
into the sky.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.292
<i>BURNS:</i>
<i>Now, listen.</i>

11:32.358 --> 11:35.228
Explain that you have a way
to make his life easier.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.729
Pretend it's your idea.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.731
He's stupid enough
to believe you have an idea.

11:38.798 --> 11:40.600
<i>Say, "What if I told you</i>

11:40.667 --> 11:42.802

"What if I told you there was
a way to harvest that noble gas

11:46.806 --> 11:49.442
without the strain
on your mouth puffer."

11:49.509 --> 11:51.110
I'd say, "Aw, pshaw,"

11:51.177 --> 11:53.746
but then I'd follow it
with a "Go on."

11:53.813 --> 11:55.815

‐"Excellent."

11:55.882 --> 11:57.750
<i>BURNS:</i>

12:05.158 --> 12:07.727
I'll have to mull your proposal,

12:07.794 --> 12:10.763
especially that last crazy part.

12:10.830 --> 12:14.601
(exhales) You just saved me
a passel of work.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.737
Now I can spend more time
making more family.

Homer J. Simpson.

12:19.305 --> 12:22.775
Cletus Delroy Montfort
Bigglesworth Spuckler.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.744
Now, let's go yonder

12:24.811 --> 12:27.013
and get ourselves
a mess of catfish.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.750
All right, I'm gonna get my arm
so deep into that catfish hole,

12:30.817 --> 12:33.820
that ole chucklehead
just bites my bone.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.590
Easy‐peasy.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.093
(screams)

12:40.159 --> 12:42.762
Now, don't scare him.
It sours up the flavor.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.998
(screaming)

12:46.866 --> 12:49.469

12:52.038 --> 12:53.706
‐Is it dead?
‐Mm‐hmm.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.208
Thank you.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.809
All right, nothing like

12:56.876 --> 12:59.879
a good ole
Spuckler family fish fry.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.815
Dear Lord,
thank you for bringing

13:02.882 --> 13:04.817
this hairless swamp beast
our way.

13:04.884 --> 13:08.921
‐Aw.
‐His wisdom regarding
your mystery balloon gas

13:08.988 --> 13:11.858
has helped us Spucklers
become a two‐radio family.

13:11.924 --> 13:14.193
Homer,
I want to be your partner.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.863
Seal the deal
with a hillbilly handshake.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.164
Come on.

13:19.832 --> 13:22.335
I consider you family now,

13:22.402 --> 13:25.905
which is not really
that select a circle.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.911
(upbeat cabaret music playing)

13:45.958 --> 13:46.893
BURNS:
Excellent.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.394
(gasps)
Where'd that come from?

13:48.461 --> 13:50.730
Well done, Simpson.
We'll take him for everything

13:50.797 --> 13:52.398
except the couch on his lawn.

13:52.465 --> 13:53.900
Well, but we're family.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.369
‐Couldn't you
just screw him half over?
‐(scoffs)

13:56.436 --> 13:57.937
No one screws anyone half over.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.906
It's like having
half a billion dollars.

13:59.972 --> 14:00.907
What's the point of that?

14:02.075 --> 14:03.976
What's up?

14:04.043 --> 14:05.378
I think we're both upset,

14:05.445 --> 14:07.380
but I'm worried
you're gonna talk first.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.015
No, you go ahead.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.018
(sighs)
I'm supposed to screw over a guy

14:12.085 --> 14:13.353
that's only been nice to me.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.254
I'm denying Maggie happiness

14:15.321 --> 14:18.257
‐because I can't stand
the mother of her friend.
‐Aw.

14:18.324 --> 14:19.759
Maggie'll be fine.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.094
I just played with her.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.897
(chuckles) She still thinks
I've got her nose.

14:24.964 --> 14:26.199
Wait, where'd I put it?

14:26.265 --> 14:28.034
Not here.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.335
No. No.

14:30.636 --> 14:33.506
Oh, look what you found.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.777
I have something
I need to tell you.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.880
Hudson had a birthday party,

14:40.947 --> 14:43.516
but I didn't tell you,
so you missed it.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.053
I can explain.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.455
That other mom
was just so annoying

14:49.522 --> 14:52.258
with her aerial silks
and those yoga pants.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.594
She does Pilates, not yoga.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.763
She made me feel bad
about myself.

‐You done floated my mark‐maker.
‐I won't

16:22.548 --> 16:25.151

a trick to steal your helium.
