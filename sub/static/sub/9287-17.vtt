WEBVTT

00:03.713 --> 00:05.704
Damn fleas.

00:07.193 --> 00:11.345
"Depress tab to activate,
then immediately leave area."

00:29.233 --> 00:30.825
- Did you set it off?
- Yeah.

00:30.913 --> 00:34.349
OK. Let's do the other two
and leave before they eat us alive.

00:34.433 --> 00:36.822
That's the plan.

00:36.913 --> 00:39.586
Hold your breath. Ready? On three.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.664
One, two, three.

00:51.433 --> 00:56.746
- That was close.
- Thanks for bringing the bombs.

00:56.833 --> 00:59.791
No problem. Stay out of there
for a couple hours.

00:59.873 --> 01:02.706
Yeah, I'll stay right here with my little fella.

01:04.113 --> 01:06.263
Oh, actually,

01:07.273 --> 01:10.583
I gotta bounce. I'm meeting Logan at Crash.

01:12.233 --> 01:14.793
I wish you could come. You know that.

01:14.873 --> 01:18.070
Tomorrow maybe I'll get some
time off from work and hang.

01:18.153 --> 01:21.623
- OK.
- I got some flea powder.

01:22.233 --> 01:25.782
Douse yourself or you'll be
right back where you started.

01:25.873 --> 01:27.864
OK? Good night.

01:28.313 --> 01:29.792
OK. Night.

01:42.473 --> 01:44.907
This seat taken?

01:44.993 --> 01:48.668
- Oh, hey.
- Sorry I'm late. I had to stop by Joshua's.

01:49.953 --> 01:54.390
- Whatcha doing?
- Trying to piece a couple of things together.

01:54.473 --> 01:56.464
That's cool, but... here?

01:57.833 --> 02:00.028
Yeah. No one's looking.

02:00.113 --> 02:02.832
Can I see the cut on your hand
for a second? Come on.

02:08.953 --> 02:12.025
It's fading fast. So all of
White's cult pals have one?

02:12.113 --> 02:14.752
Yep. Right here.

02:14.833 --> 02:18.587
I saw it when they saluted their
holy snake god, or whatever it was.

02:18.993 --> 02:23.032
Looks like a modified version of
a caduceus. Symbol of medicine.

02:24.073 --> 02:29.386
You know what? All work and no play
makes Logan a dull, dull boy.

02:40.353 --> 02:42.787
I'll talk to you later, OK?

02:45.753 --> 02:47.789
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:48.513 --> 02:50.981
- Long time no see.
- I guess so.

02:51.473 --> 02:54.590
- You avoiding me?
- No.

02:54.673 --> 02:58.461
But I gotta say that I'm really glad
nothing happened that night.

02:59.833 --> 03:02.870
- Yeah, me too.
- Probably works for days, huh?

03:03.553 --> 03:09.310
Your whole "time is short, gotta put your
heart on the line, baby I want you" speech.

03:11.153 --> 03:15.351
Look. You don't want to get involved with me.

03:15.433 --> 03:21.065
I was made in a lab. I spent my formative
years learning the fine art of assassination.

03:21.153 --> 03:26.910
There are guys out there looking to kill me,
and someday they'll probably succeed.

03:26.993 --> 03:31.942
Spare me the drama. You're just too scared
to let go and actually care about somebody.

03:32.753 --> 03:38.589
Right, because the last time I let go,
someone got caught in the crossfire and died.

03:40.153 --> 03:44.953
- I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Do yourself a favour, Asha. Leave me alone.

03:44.953 --> 03:45.305
- I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Do yourself a favour, Asha. Leave me alone.

03:46.273 --> 03:48.343
Alec.

03:48.433 --> 03:50.469
Beat it.

04:01.873 --> 04:03.864
Can I get another beer?

04:03.953 --> 04:05.944
So, what'd you do now?

04:07.473 --> 04:09.987
Why am I always the bad guy with you, Max?

04:10.073 --> 04:13.429
Whatever. You wanna blow
your shot with her, be my guest.

04:13.513 --> 04:17.950
I could be this charming, sweet guy
and score myself a really nice girlfriend.

04:18.033 --> 04:21.992
But, unlike you, I'm trying
to do the right thing.

04:22.072 --> 04:23.870
What is that supposed to mean?

04:23.953 --> 04:28.663
You think your only problem is an engineered
virus that'll kill Logan if you touch him?

04:28.753 --> 04:33.031
- Yeah, that takes the front seat.
- Max, we don't belong with them.

04:34.793 --> 04:37.148
We're a danger to them.

04:38.473 --> 04:42.261
- When will you see that?
- Me and Logan are none of your business.

04:42.353 --> 04:46.028
- Why don't you just open your eyes...
- Hey, guys. What's goin' on?

04:46.513 --> 04:50.506
- Nothing.
- Yeah, right. Nothing.

04:56.113 --> 04:58.183
Max.

04:58.273 --> 05:02.107
I'm beat. I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

05:02.593 --> 05:07.269
- What was that all about?
- Nothing. I'm just tired.

05:37.473 --> 05:39.464
Max.

05:39.753 --> 05:41.744
Max?

05:43.633 --> 05:45.749
You OK?

05:45.833 --> 05:46.193
How's he doing?

05:46.193 --> 05:47.911
How's he doing?

05:49.753 --> 05:52.631
Don't let him die, please.

05:52.953 --> 05:58.869
From what I can tell, the virus is a mutated
strain of a bio-warfare agent called Zycinor.

05:58.953 --> 06:01.672
There's no known cure.

06:01.753 --> 06:05.871
Manticore made us immune to
a bunch of germ-warfare bugs.

06:05.953 --> 06:08.023
I'm pretty sure this is one of them.

06:08.113 --> 06:12.709
That'd explain how you could be a carrier
and not be affected. You've got antibodies.

06:12.793 --> 06:15.591
- What about a transfusion?
- You'd reinfect him.

06:15.673 --> 06:18.028
No, not my blood. Another transgenic.

06:19.193 --> 06:21.661
It's worth a try. We've got nothing to lose.

06:26.593 --> 06:29.790
- Yeah?
- I need you to come to the hospital now.

06:29.873 --> 06:32.467
You got it, Max. I'll be there soon as I can.

06:38.393 --> 06:40.031
He's coming. Get ready.

06:49.153 --> 06:52.270
Don't even think it. You're under arrest.

06:58.353 --> 07:03.029
They designed her to be
the perfect soldier, a human weapon.

07:03.113 --> 07:05.104
Then she escaped.

07:05.193 --> 07:09.505
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

07:09.593 --> 07:11.982
she is haunted by her past.

07:12.073 --> 07:13.426
She cannot run.

07:13.513 --> 07:17.506
She must fight to discover her destiny.

07:57.273 --> 07:59.264
So, I hear you're feeling better.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.821
I'm working hard, doing what the men tell me.

08:04.153 --> 08:06.144
Doing a good job.

08:08.313 --> 08:11.225
It's OK. I'm not gonna hurt you, Mule.

08:12.273 --> 08:15.709
You cut me. Put the snake blood in me
and said it would kill me.

08:18.313 --> 08:22.386
- You didn't tell anybody about that, did you?
- You told me not to.

08:22.473 --> 08:26.352
Good. I figured you were a solid guy.

08:26.793 --> 08:30.547
Sorry I had to do that to you,
but it was the only way.

08:31.113 --> 08:34.741
Sort of like a test. You know?

08:35.793 --> 08:38.830
But don't worry. You passed.

08:39.832 --> 08:45.191
Remember, though,
that is between you and me.

09:02.073 --> 09:04.633
To do this, your friend better get here soon.

09:04.713 --> 09:08.183
He will. He knows how serious this is. He's...

09:09.313 --> 09:11.429
a completely unreliable jerk.

09:11.513 --> 09:14.186
Is there anybody else you can get?

09:14.273 --> 09:17.390
Cos this is the only shot Logan has.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.742
I'll be back.

09:26.513 --> 09:28.504
Is someone there?

09:29.473 --> 09:31.111
Are you hurt?

09:31.193 --> 09:33.627
No, I'm not hurt.

09:33.713 --> 09:38.150
Billie's never done this before.
She just pulled me up these steps.

09:39.553 --> 09:41.987
Guess she just likes you.

09:46.713 --> 09:48.908
She helps you?

09:48.993 --> 09:51.712
She leads me around. Makes sure I'm safe.

09:51.793 --> 09:55.024
- Makes sure you don't bump into things.
- I guess so.

09:55.953 --> 09:57.944
Good Billie. Good Billie.

09:58.033 --> 10:02.311
I'm Annie. Annie Fisher. I live up the street.

10:02.393 --> 10:05.942
I'm Joshua. I'm from...

10:07.233 --> 10:11.021
not here. Not here. I'm visiting.

10:11.113 --> 10:15.265
- Oh, from where?
- Manti... Coro.

10:15.993 --> 10:18.348
- Mantia Coro?
- In France.

10:18.433 --> 10:21.584
- Your English is very good.
- Merci beaucoup.

10:25.113 --> 10:27.308
Well, we should probably be going.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.782
Come on, Billie. Come on.

10:39.833 --> 10:43.223
- It's nice to meet you, Joshua.
- Nice to meet you, Annie.

10:53.953 --> 10:56.626
Joshua! I need your help!

11:00.513 --> 11:02.708
Hey. I came as soon as I heard.

11:02.793 --> 11:06.752
- Hi, Original Cindy.
- That doggie-dog under there?

11:06.833 --> 11:09.028
Did you find someone?

11:10.873 --> 11:13.148
He has a little canine DNA.

11:15.433 --> 11:20.348
Right. Well, OK, so long
as he's got the antibodies.

11:20.953 --> 11:22.466
Be right back.

11:50.233 --> 11:52.224
Logan will get better now.

11:58.273 --> 12:00.582
We're ready when you are, Mrs Ryan.

12:03.673 --> 12:05.664
Bring 'em in.

12:19.793 --> 12:21.749
Him. He's the one.

12:22.873 --> 12:28.106
- I gotta be somewhere, pal. Can I go now?
- You've been ID'd.

12:28.193 --> 12:31.742
- For what?
- The murder of Timothy Ryan.

12:35.073 --> 12:37.633
He's gonna be all right. You'll see.

12:38.993 --> 12:41.461
He's a fighter. He's gonna hang on.

12:47.153 --> 12:49.353
The antibodies in your friend's blood are
neutralising the virus. He's gonna make it.

12:49.353 --> 12:53.551
The antibodies in your friend's blood are
neutralising the virus. He's gonna make it.

12:55.793 --> 12:58.353
You hear that? He's gonna be OK.

13:01.713 --> 13:03.704
He asked to see you.

13:12.393 --> 13:14.953
- I can't go in there.
- He's asking for you.

13:16.193 --> 13:19.265
I can't see him. Not now.

13:21.233 --> 13:25.624
- Not ever again.
- You're just saying that cos you're upset.

13:25.713 --> 13:28.352
You heard the lady. He's gonna be fine.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.425
This time. But what about next time?

13:34.793 --> 13:36.784
No, this has to stop.

13:37.993 --> 13:40.382
Tell him I'm glad he's OK.

13:47.713 --> 13:50.068
Alec!

13:50.153 --> 13:52.508
Any of you reprobates seen Alec?

13:52.593 --> 13:56.666
Isn't here, doesn't call, thinks only
of himself, always hurts the one...

13:56.753 --> 14:00.712
- Hey, crustacean. You seen Golden Boy?
- No.

14:00.793 --> 14:05.913
Let's go, people. Mission bell's a-ringing.
Let's go! Hear it? Bip-bip-bip!

14:07.473 --> 14:10.146
Logan asked where you were.
I didn't know what to say.

14:10.233 --> 14:12.747
It's OK. It's not your problem.

14:12.833 --> 14:14.824
Is that him?

14:15.433 --> 14:19.108
If you're serious about this,
you owe him an explanation.

14:21.113 --> 14:24.708
- Hi, stranger.
- Hi.

14:24.793 --> 14:26.306
You missed it.

14:26.393 --> 14:30.352
I wandered all over the hospital looking
for you with the back of my gown open.

14:30.673 --> 14:36.031
- Yeah, sorry about that. Listen...
- I'm feeling pretty good, actually.

14:36.113 --> 14:39.742
- Must be all that transgenic blood.
- We need to talk.

14:39.833 --> 14:42.347
I pulled out an old board I had

14:42.433 --> 14:45.664
and put up all the doodlings
I made at the bar the other night.

14:45.753 --> 14:49.951
It's kind of my wide-screen version,
you know?

14:50.033 --> 14:52.547
- Logan...
- Don't, Max.

14:54.553 --> 14:56.862
I can't do this any more.

14:57.873 --> 15:01.422
Look, I'm fine. Everything turned out OK.

15:01.513 --> 15:06.507
We got lucky. Again. How many miracles
do you think we're gonna get?

15:06.593 --> 15:09.551
Do I get a vote? It is my life on the line.

15:09.633 --> 15:10.513
So what, you end up dead and I get to spend
the rest of my life knowing it's my fault?

15:10.513 --> 15:14.904
So what, you end up dead and I get to spend
the rest of my life knowing it's my fault?

15:15.913 --> 15:18.029
I pass.

15:18.113 --> 15:20.502
I've been where you are, remember?

15:21.913 --> 15:24.063
Thinking it was all too hard.

15:27.193 --> 15:30.947
But I realised being away
from you was worse.

15:34.873 --> 15:37.910
- I have to hang up now.
- Max.

15:56.033 --> 15:58.422
- Fe'nos tol.
- Fe'nos tol.

15:59.353 --> 16:03.904
I tested the transgenic. Damn thing
got sick, but it pulled through.

16:03.993 --> 16:09.306
- That girl's survival wasn’t just a fluke?
- Afraid not. Something's different about 452.

16:09.393 --> 16:13.306
- She never exhibited any symptoms.
- What should I tell the Conclave?

16:13.393 --> 16:18.069
It's possible that Sandeman made
the Manticore transgenics immune.

16:20.833 --> 16:23.552
This changes everything.

16:23.633 --> 16:25.749
It's time to make a move.

16:28.273 --> 16:30.946
- Joshua?
- Annie.

16:31.033 --> 16:35.106
It's funny, we were walking past
and Billie veered up your steps again.

16:35.193 --> 16:38.026
- She really likes you.
- I like her, too.

16:38.113 --> 16:41.150
She's usually a really good
judge of character.

16:42.673 --> 16:47.667
I hope you don't think I'm being forward,
but I wanted to invite you to dinner.

16:55.073 --> 16:59.589
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

16:59.673 --> 17:02.062
I thought, with you
being new in town and all...

17:04.153 --> 17:06.906
That's OK. You're probably really busy.

17:07.433 --> 17:09.424
- I'd love to.
- What?

17:09.512 --> 17:12.073
- Love to have dinner.
- Great.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.708
- I live down the street, across from...
- No, here.

17:16.792 --> 17:19.182
Because... I love to cook.

17:20.433 --> 17:23.391
- You like macaroni and cheese?
- It's my favourite.

17:25.752 --> 17:30.463
- Is that turpentine?
- Yes. I paint.

17:31.193 --> 17:33.184
- You're a painter?
- Yes.

17:33.273 --> 17:35.833
Wow, a painter from Mantia Coro.

17:36.953 --> 17:39.387
Right here on my little street.

17:41.993 --> 17:46.191
- I'll see you around seven, OK?
- OK.

17:52.873 --> 17:54.864
So you did it.

17:56.193 --> 18:00.152
- It's over.
- Yeah. It's over.

18:00.233 --> 18:04.829
- Ladies. You hear what happened to Alec?
- Don't care.

18:04.913 --> 18:06.949
- He's in jail.
- Whatever.

18:07.033 --> 18:11.709
Hummer, the bartender from last night,
saw him get pinched right outside of here.

18:11.793 --> 18:14.353
Kind of makes you wonder what he did, huh?

18:14.433 --> 18:16.424
Not really.

18:19.113 --> 18:21.946
- You won't go help him?
- I got my own problems.

18:22.033 --> 18:24.672
Alec can take care of himself.

18:25.753 --> 18:28.551
Now, you know you gotta
come correct on this.

18:28.633 --> 18:32.672
Suppose they tip to his bar code.
Exposure, the whole thing.

18:32.753 --> 18:37.781
Bad for Alec, bad for you,
bad for Joshua, bad for everybody.

18:40.273 --> 18:44.391
Not like saving his butt
isn't already my full-time job.

18:45.193 --> 18:47.787
Thanks for the beer.

18:57.873 --> 19:02.185
Whitney Mann, Public Defender's Office.
I'll be handling your case.

19:02.273 --> 19:04.264
Pleasure.

19:04.833 --> 19:05.633
If you need anything, I'm right outside.

19:05.633 --> 19:07.146
If you need anything, I'm right outside.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.747
- You got five minutes.
- Thank you.

19:12.633 --> 19:14.988
- Max, I'm sorry. I was on my way...
- Shut up.

19:15.073 --> 19:19.942
I came to bail your sorry ass out. I figured
you got grabbed for one of your scams.

19:20.033 --> 19:23.343
- But the officer said you killed somebody.
- I didn't do it.

19:23.433 --> 19:25.947
You got ID'd. There's a perfect DNA match.

19:26.033 --> 19:28.991
- I'm telling you...
- Don't tell me anything.

19:29.073 --> 19:32.463
I'm sorry I let you out of Manticore
and inflicted you on the world.

19:32.553 --> 19:36.466
Screw exposure. I'm leaving you here
for White to deal with.

19:36.553 --> 19:41.911
- Max, I swear, I'm innocent.
- Tell that to Ames. And give him my regards.

19:41.993 --> 19:44.712
You think I could
murder someone in cold blood?

19:44.793 --> 19:46.272
Yes, I think you could.

19:46.353 --> 19:49.868
The guy's teeth were pulled
from his head, for God's sake.

19:51.873 --> 19:54.341
Ben.

19:55.393 --> 19:58.385
- Ben, why are you doing this?
- You know why.

19:59.593 --> 20:01.663
Come on, Max.

20:01.753 --> 20:06.702
There's no way it was me. That guy was
killed over a year ago. I was at Manticore.

20:07.033 --> 20:08.830
Time's up.

20:12.233 --> 20:14.872
Max, what made you think I didn't do it?

20:14.953 --> 20:18.946
I'm just curious. Was it my eyes?
Some people say I have sincere eyes.

20:19.033 --> 20:21.422
Quiet. Here.

20:30.553 --> 20:34.182
Was it the teeth thing?
I can hardly stand going to the dentist.

20:34.273 --> 20:37.424
- Shut up, OK?
- Why are you taking this so personally?

20:40.113 --> 20:43.423
- Because it was Ben.
- Ben, my Manticore twin Ben?

20:46.873 --> 20:49.785
He killed Timothy Ryan and
ten other people. Same MO.

20:49.873 --> 20:54.230
Oh. They told me back at Manticore
that he'd gone nuts, but... a serial killer?

20:54.313 --> 20:57.146
One more word and
I shove you off this ledge.

21:06.153 --> 21:08.906
- Max, tell me you've got a plan.
- Hang on.

21:10.993 --> 21:12.665
What are you doing? No.

21:15.793 --> 21:17.784
What's going on?

21:28.393 --> 21:30.907
This was your plan?

21:30.993 --> 21:32.631
Jump!

21:41.873 --> 21:45.149
I should've stayed where I was
and taken my chances.

21:52.033 --> 21:54.388
Come on!

22:04.153 --> 22:07.190
The thing that's got me worried is,
I can't exactly use

22:07.273 --> 22:11.664
"Well, I was locked up in a secret
government facility" as my alibi.

22:11.753 --> 22:14.551
- Guess not.
- You know.

22:14.633 --> 22:17.101
Maybe Logan could pull one of his little...

22:17.193 --> 22:20.390
Oh, my God. Logan. Is he all right?

22:20.833 --> 22:23.393
- He's fine. Joshua came through.
- Oh, good.

22:23.473 --> 22:27.227
Logan could use a little
canine plasma to loosen him up.

22:29.593 --> 22:32.027
Just kidding, Max. You know I love Logan.

22:32.113 --> 22:34.911
I mean, not the way you love him. It's just...

22:35.353 --> 22:37.469
He's OK, right?

22:40.553 --> 22:42.623
So what's the problem?

22:43.753 --> 22:47.382
- I'm not gonna see him any more.
- Any more this week?

22:48.113 --> 22:50.229
Ever.

22:52.273 --> 22:55.868
I can't risk it. And I don't
wanna hear an "I told you so."

22:56.873 --> 22:58.864
I wasn't going to.

23:04.273 --> 23:06.548
Coffee?

23:06.633 --> 23:08.749
Yeah, sure.

23:10.553 --> 23:15.422
Listen, since we're already
knee-deep in painful subjects,

23:16.633 --> 23:19.830
tell me about him. About Ben.

23:26.233 --> 23:32.342
When we were kids back at Manticore,
he always wanted answers for everything.

23:33.633 --> 23:36.705
Why we were there, what was outside.

23:38.033 --> 23:42.231
So he would make up these
fantastic stories to explain things.

23:44.273 --> 23:47.470
Somehow it made us feel...

23:48.233 --> 23:50.224
Loved.

23:51.073 --> 23:54.110
Like we weren't all alone.

23:56.113 --> 23:58.946
Sounds like a nice kid. What went wrong?

24:01.233 --> 24:03.952
After we escaped,

24:04.033 --> 24:07.708
there were too many things in this world
he didn't have answers for.

24:08.113 --> 24:11.947
We never should've left.
Everything made sense then.

24:12.793 --> 24:15.751
I don't know. He just...

24:16.993 --> 24:18.949
Lost it.

24:28.833 --> 24:30.983
Hey, you OK?

24:32.233 --> 24:34.144
I'm fine.

24:44.553 --> 24:46.544
Max, what is it?

24:49.873 --> 24:52.592
We were in the woods.

24:52.673 --> 24:54.743
He was hurt,

24:54.833 --> 24:58.143
and Manticore was closing in on us.

25:01.513 --> 25:06.143
- He didn't wanna go back there.
- Reindoctrination.

25:06.233 --> 25:08.224
Or worse.

25:12.153 --> 25:14.144
I killed him.

25:16.313 --> 25:19.271
He asked me to, so I did.

25:25.073 --> 25:27.303
And then I ran.

25:27.393 --> 25:29.384
I saved myself.

25:31.233 --> 25:36.148
And I just left his body there
for them to take away.

25:47.993 --> 25:49.984
Max, I'm sorry.

25:58.793 --> 26:03.503
There was an outbreak of measles
after the Pulse hit.

26:03.593 --> 26:08.269
The only place to get medicine was the black
market. My parents didn't have the money.

26:08.833 --> 26:13.907
I almost didn't pull through.
When it was over, I couldn't see any more.

26:15.633 --> 26:18.067
But you have Billie.

26:18.153 --> 26:20.667
She's a good friend.

26:20.753 --> 26:24.302
But I still remember
what some things look like.

26:24.393 --> 26:27.942
Colours. My mother's smile.

26:29.953 --> 26:32.308
You're not like most people, are you?

26:32.393 --> 26:35.510
What I mean is, sometimes
people feel sorry for me.

26:35.593 --> 26:40.348
I can hear it in their voices. I guess
it's cos I can't do everything they do.

26:40.433 --> 26:44.267
You can go out. And you can talk to people.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.982
You could go to Crash and party and dance.

26:48.073 --> 26:51.827
- I know, but...
- You should do that.

26:53.073 --> 26:55.587
Maybe you could come with me.

26:56.913 --> 26:58.426
Maybe.

26:58.953 --> 27:02.389
I wish I could see your paintings.
I'm so curious.

27:02.473 --> 27:06.068
I bet they'd tell me
everything there is to know about you.

27:11.073 --> 27:13.541
Blue, like the sky.

27:15.953 --> 27:20.469
And this is green, like your eyes.

27:21.993 --> 27:24.029
It's beautiful, Joshua.

27:25.673 --> 27:29.382
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

27:36.513 --> 27:40.472
Guess what, Mule.
You're gettin' out of here.

28:03.073 --> 28:06.827
Lay low until we get this whole
mistaken-identity thing sorted out.

28:06.913 --> 28:09.791
Maybe I'll crash at Joshua's.
Think he'll mind?

28:09.873 --> 28:12.433
Are you kidding? He'll love it.

28:13.833 --> 28:16.222
Thanks for saving my butt - again.

28:17.873 --> 28:21.229
Must be hard, having me around.

28:21.313 --> 28:25.352
A guy with Ben's face making you think
about things you'd rather forget.

28:26.193 --> 28:31.187
Yeah. That's probably why
I'm such a bitch to you sometimes.

28:31.633 --> 28:33.749
Maybe.

28:35.433 --> 28:39.506
Or, you know, maybe it's because
I'm such a pain in the ass sometimes.

28:48.313 --> 28:51.703
- Be careful.
- Always.

29:05.393 --> 29:07.907
Josh!

29:07.993 --> 29:10.587
Where you at, pal? Josh?

29:10.673 --> 29:10.753
Josh, you around?

29:10.753 --> 29:12.664
Josh, you around?

29:14.753 --> 29:16.789
Hey, roomie.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.428
- Roomie?
- Yeah.

29:19.513 --> 29:23.347
I need to hang out for a little while
till the heat's off my place.

29:23.433 --> 29:28.029
It turns out my dead twin brother
was a psycho killer.

29:28.113 --> 29:30.104
Go figure.

29:31.153 --> 29:33.303
Where's your TV?

29:34.113 --> 29:36.104
No TV.

29:40.113 --> 29:42.752
Book. You can read?

29:44.953 --> 29:48.582
Are we livin' in the Dark Ages?
Come on, pal. I need my boob tube.

29:48.673 --> 29:51.471
The hot medium. The vast wasteland.

29:53.193 --> 29:56.902
Look, sorry. You know what?
I think I know where I can score one.

30:04.753 --> 30:07.142
What you got there? A new work?

30:07.233 --> 30:09.224
Joshua number 320?

30:13.593 --> 30:15.584
Annie.

30:17.953 --> 30:19.784
Annie?

30:19.873 --> 30:22.433
Who exactly is Annie?

30:22.513 --> 30:24.822
A girl who lives down the street.

30:28.273 --> 30:32.869
- Listen, Josh.
- Alec, she can't see.

30:32.953 --> 30:36.741
No running, no screaming. It's OK.

30:36.833 --> 30:39.791
Oh boy. We need to have
a little talk about Annie.

30:39.873 --> 30:42.512
I don't want to have a little talk.

30:42.593 --> 30:45.107
I know I have to lay low.

30:45.193 --> 30:47.627
I'm tired of laying low, Alec.

30:59.273 --> 31:01.264
Mule?

31:02.713 --> 31:07.309
You see that fence? All you have to do
is get over it and you'll be safe.

31:07.753 --> 31:11.382
- OK.
- But watch out for enemy soldiers.

31:11.473 --> 31:14.829
Cos if they see you, they will try and kill you.

31:14.913 --> 31:17.268
They'll be wearing helmets, carrying guns,

31:17.353 --> 31:20.026
and they'll have badges
that say "Sector Police".

31:20.113 --> 31:21.513
- Sector Police.
- That's right.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.229
- Sector Police.
- That's right.

31:22.633 --> 31:24.624
Good luck.

31:26.953 --> 31:30.468
Thank you... for everything.

31:51.913 --> 31:53.904
Man, that's a freak.

32:08.193 --> 32:12.789
You have violated checkpoint security.
Stay where you are.

32:19.193 --> 32:21.184
Freeze!

32:22.513 --> 32:24.822
- On your knees, freak.
- On the ground, now!

32:24.913 --> 32:25.873
Down! Now!

32:25.873 --> 32:26.783
Down! Now!

33:16.953 --> 33:20.104
Alec, the boob tube is too loud.

33:21.033 --> 33:24.708
That's the only way to enjoy it.
Come over and have a look.

33:33.793 --> 33:38.105
- Tricks and treats.
- Welcome to the world of attention deficit.

33:40.633 --> 33:42.749
This is a Channel Three news break.

33:42.833 --> 33:45.393
A hoverdrone recorded this shocking footage.

33:45.473 --> 33:48.704
Authorities refuse to comment
on the nature of the assailant.

33:48.793 --> 33:54.265
But, as you can see, the attacker has what can
only be described as superhuman strength.

33:54.353 --> 33:57.265
- This is bad.
...described by witnesses as a mutant...

33:57.353 --> 33:59.184
This is so very bad.

33:59.273 --> 34:05.269
He's believed to have escaped from a covert
government project known as Manticore.

34:05.353 --> 34:08.583
Authorities deny all knowledge of Manticore...

34:08.672 --> 34:11.471
That's the thing I saw in the sewer last week.

34:11.713 --> 34:14.431
Whoa, Nellie. Look at that sucker.

34:15.993 --> 34:21.989
One officer was seriously injured before
others opened fire. Eyewitnesses claimed...

34:22.072 --> 34:24.063
Max.

34:26.672 --> 34:30.222
- Lay low, Alec.
- Lay low? Is that all you have to say to me?

34:31.953 --> 34:35.628
- Joshua? It's me, Annie.
- Send her away.

34:35.713 --> 34:39.501
You can't be with her now.
You see that. You see what's going on.

34:39.592 --> 34:41.743
- Alec, she's...
- Send her away.

34:41.833 --> 34:45.109
Before she falls in love with you
or wants you to meet her family.

34:45.193 --> 34:48.583
Before you get yourself killed,
before you get her killed.

34:48.672 --> 34:50.664
Send her away.

34:55.033 --> 34:59.311
Billie and I were gonna walk to the store.
Thought maybe you'd like to come.

35:01.713 --> 35:04.068
- Annie...
- What's wrong?

35:05.993 --> 35:08.461
- The news.
- What news?

35:08.913 --> 35:12.428
News from back home. I have to go.

35:13.873 --> 35:17.786
- When?
- Today.

35:29.833 --> 35:33.951
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.

35:34.753 --> 35:36.744
Goodbye, Annie.

35:39.033 --> 35:41.024
Joshua!

35:46.153 --> 35:48.542
Can you do something for me?

35:50.153 --> 35:53.304
I just... I want to remember you.

36:37.793 --> 36:40.944
You can see it right there, the bar code.

36:41.033 --> 36:44.025
Unconfirmed reports suggest
these tattoos were used

36:44.113 --> 36:48.106
to keep track of the various soldiers
involved in the programme.

36:48.193 --> 36:50.070
The mutant's body was rushed away

36:50.153 --> 36:54.226
based on officials' concerns
regarding a potential biohazard.

36:56.433 --> 36:59.505
- Thanks for ringin' back.
- You've seen the news?

36:59.593 --> 37:03.745
Yeah, but that's not why I'm calling.
I need you to get over here.

37:04.633 --> 37:08.831
I know you're sad, but you did the right thing.

37:08.913 --> 37:14.306
Remember we talked about how we're not like
other people and we need to stick together?

37:14.393 --> 37:16.782
Right now that's more important than ever.

37:18.673 --> 37:21.665
Annie's not like other people.
She's different.

37:21.753 --> 37:23.630
But she's not like us either.

37:23.713 --> 37:28.503
When you care about someone, you have to
do what's best for them, even if it hurts.

37:35.713 --> 37:37.749
Love sucks.

37:43.313 --> 37:46.191
Joshua, where did you get this?

37:46.273 --> 37:48.264
Father gave it to me.

38:11.473 --> 38:14.670
- Hi there.
- The lights were out.

38:14.753 --> 38:18.985
- I didn't know you were home.
- If you did, you wouldn't have come, huh?

38:20.193 --> 38:24.152
I found this around Joshua's neck.
He said Father gave it to him.

38:24.913 --> 38:27.552
It's the same symbol the breeding cult uses.

38:28.473 --> 38:34.469
So Sandeman is one of White's
cult loonies, huh? Whoo-hoo!

38:34.553 --> 38:38.307
There's a connection between
the breeding cult and Manticore.

38:39.313 --> 38:43.101
Maybe I ought to do an Eyes Only hack, huh?

38:43.193 --> 38:46.822
I mean, it's a big news day,
in case you hadn't noticed.

38:46.913 --> 38:52.909
I tried paging you. Wanted to talk
to you but... I guess you were busy.

38:52.993 --> 38:56.224
I'm going. I just thought you wanted to know.

39:00.713 --> 39:03.432
- Cut it out.
- I could keep you here all night.

39:05.393 --> 39:08.226
- Come on, Logan.
- At least till I drop dead.

39:10.673 --> 39:15.349
- I've said everything I needed to say.
- I don't think so.

39:16.593 --> 39:19.471
- I think there's something else.
- Logan.

39:22.833 --> 39:27.224
- Or is it someone else?
- What?

39:27.593 --> 39:33.190
I needed to talk to you,
so I came by your apartment.

39:36.433 --> 39:38.663
And I saw him leaving.

39:42.513 --> 39:45.505
I mean, if I've got it wrong, just say so.

39:49.033 --> 39:51.024
Tell me it's not true.

39:57.793 --> 39:59.988
I can't.

40:04.393 --> 40:08.102
It's over. We're done.

40:08.993 --> 40:11.109
Get used to it.

40:45.353 --> 40:48.789
Hey, Max. Thought I'd find you here.

40:48.873 --> 40:51.182
I come here to be alone.

40:52.273 --> 40:54.707
I know. But, after what went down today,

40:54.793 --> 40:57.910
I figured we could both
use a friend right now.

40:57.993 --> 41:00.348
Sit down.

41:08.033 --> 41:12.902
So, you got any deep thoughts
you want to share?

41:12.993 --> 41:17.225
Any profound realisations about life?

41:17.873 --> 41:19.704
Yeah.

41:19.793 --> 41:21.784
Love sucks.
