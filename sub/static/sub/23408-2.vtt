WEBVTT

00:06.160 --> 00:07.760
Mum brought me here,
day before my Solstice.

00:07.800 --> 00:08.840
What did she say?

00:08.880 --> 00:11.800
You don't have to do
everything Dad says.

00:11.840 --> 00:12.960
Did Dad know that?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.240
All men know that.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.760
They just don't like
to talk about it.

00:21.040 --> 00:21.960
Oh, shit.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.360
In a few hours' time,

00:23.400 --> 00:26.080
400 ships will set sail
for Britannia.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.320
20,000 men.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.080
Or, to be more precise,
19,996,

00:31.120 --> 00:33.280
because you four
didn't fancy it.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.000
What was it, eh?

00:36.040 --> 00:36.920
The weather?

00:36.960 --> 00:37.920
Hear this, Pellenor!

00:37.960 --> 00:40.360
I shit on the souls
of your dead.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.480
This war with the Regni
will rage for generations,

00:44.520 --> 00:46.000
thanks to you.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.640
This place is at war
with itself.

00:47.680 --> 00:48.760
So what's the plan?

00:48.800 --> 00:50.360
We find the weak points,
and we push.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.280
We push hard.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.800
Father! Father!

00:55.720 --> 00:56.680
No!

00:56.720 --> 00:58.600
I'll take you
as far as the river.

00:58.640 --> 00:59.880
It's not about you.

00:59.920 --> 01:00.760
It's about me.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.080
Good.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.280
My name is Veran.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.760
You, Numidia...

01:06.800 --> 01:09.400
you are going on a journey.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.160
You must leave these islands.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.920
Anybody else with a message from
the underworld?

01:16.960 --> 01:18.560
Speak now!

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.639 --> 02:10.840
How was your journey?

02:10.880 --> 02:13.480
Did you bring me
back something?

02:36.440 --> 02:39.880
You've done well, Numidian.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.320
Now...

02:43.280 --> 02:46.160
there's one more thing
I want you to do.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.000
Morning!

04:16.040 --> 04:17.560
Good morning.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.200
Ugh, Phelan,
what do you want?

04:19.240 --> 04:21.160
Sorry to disturb you, my dear.
Good morning, Cousin Lindon.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.200
Just to say...

04:22.240 --> 04:24.480
the Romans are here.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.480
King Pellenor!
At the gate, there's...

04:39.520 --> 04:42.280
I know who's at my gate.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.800
Fetch me my torc.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.800
Where's our king?

04:46.840 --> 04:47.800
He's not your king.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.800
Your king's sleeping
one off in Gaul.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.400
Look, fuck off,
will you?

04:51.440 --> 04:53.680
I don't like this arrangement
any more than you do.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.720
Well, you could
have fooled me.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.280
Well, I'll say this.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.920
He's fun to look at.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.000
Brave too, to come alone.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.720
He's come to parley.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.240
He brings a message
from his general.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.800
Oh... I get it.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.160
Is that what's going on?

05:20.200 --> 05:21.560
See, I wouldn't know,

05:21.600 --> 05:22.840
not knowing that much
about them.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.000
Isn't it obvious?

05:24.040 --> 05:26.560
He hasn't exactly come
to fight, has he?

05:26.600 --> 05:28.240
No, I suppose not...

05:28.280 --> 05:30.280
although with
those arms, eh?

05:31.880 --> 05:33.360
Well...

05:33.400 --> 05:34.800
this is a big moment
for you...

05:36.000 --> 05:37.720
although I have to say,
from up here,

05:37.760 --> 05:40.600
I can't really see
the resemblance.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.520
I've listened to the elders,

05:45.560 --> 05:47.480
you, my heart...

05:47.520 --> 05:51.040
and my heart tells me
this is not yet a war.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.000
Well, I agree.
There's still time.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.280
Will you speak to them?

05:54.320 --> 05:56.040
Mm.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.240
I am Vitus Aurelius,

06:09.280 --> 06:10.160
optio of the Eighth Legion,

06:10.200 --> 06:12.720
servant of Emperor Claudius.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.840
I am here

06:13.880 --> 06:16.720
under the sacred protection
of parley.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.040
Fuck off back to Rome!

06:25.040 --> 06:27.040
Now it's a war.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.440
Time to
get moving.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.560
Some Romans
just came through.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.480
Three of them.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.400
Where?

07:17.440 --> 07:18.920
They rode
straight past.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.360
If they'd seen me,
I'd be dead.

07:22.960 --> 07:23.960
You were lucky.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.280
No, it wasn't luck.
You did this.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.720
You left this to protect me.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.280
Oh, that.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.440
No, no, no,
that's not for you.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.760
It protects me
while I sleep.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.800
Oh...

07:35.840 --> 07:36.960
But it worked for you?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.880
That's interesting.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.840
Here. Eat these.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.120
Ooh!

07:48.160 --> 07:49.400
What the hell are they?

07:49.440 --> 07:50.400
Dog berries.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.560
They're disgusting.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.960
I forgot to say,
they taste like shit,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
but they keep you going.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.320
Chew! Chew!

07:59.560 --> 08:00.840
Swallow.

08:00.880 --> 08:01.720
Have you swallowed?

08:01.760 --> 08:02.560
I'm not a child!

08:02.600 --> 08:03.840
Or a woman.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.680
Hey, maybe that's why
they didn't see you.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.240
Maybe you are invisible.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.600
I hate you so much.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.280
Don't mention it.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.280
Seed.

08:17.880 --> 08:18.760
Let's go.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.560
Dillion!

08:27.600 --> 08:28.760
It's me!

08:28.800 --> 08:30.000
That's Morna.
That's my wife!

08:30.040 --> 08:30.840
Morna!

08:30.880 --> 08:31.880
Are you safe?

08:31.920 --> 08:32.799
Morna!

08:34.080 --> 08:34.880
What's that racket?

08:36.880 --> 08:38.679
Islene?

08:38.720 --> 08:40.720
Has anyone seen
Cait or Islene?

08:42.039 --> 08:43.039
Pipe down!

08:44.680 --> 08:46.200
Be quiet!

08:48.360 --> 08:52.160
If one single soldier
coming in or out of this camp

08:52.200 --> 08:53.600
is harmed,

08:53.640 --> 08:56.360
your menfolk will be executed!

08:58.000 --> 08:59.600
I trust that's clear!

09:08.400 --> 09:09.680
It's the wailers.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.560
How many?

09:10.600 --> 09:11.920
Twenty-odd.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.720
Well, keep them quiet,
but don't scare them off.

09:14.760 --> 09:15.800
When things settle,

09:15.840 --> 09:17.080
the men could use
some female company.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.080
Listen,
I've been thinking.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.840
The river...
gives us a flank,

09:21.880 --> 09:23.440
but it's too close.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.040
Bowmen could lay fire on us
without having to cross.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.760
I see.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.320
What's really the problem?

09:30.680 --> 09:32.200
Come on, I've known
you for too long.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.600
He knew
your forefather's name,

09:36.640 --> 09:38.840
Tribune Numerious
Plautius.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.280
I bang on about
that all the time.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.600
He joined a month
before we left Rome.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.680
Oh, do spit it out.

09:44.720 --> 09:45.720
He knew my history.
What of it?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.080
But why would he do that?

09:49.120 --> 09:50.960
Sacrifice his life?
It doesn't make sense.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.840
You know, I take your point
about our position,

09:55.880 --> 09:58.440
but I like
having the river close.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.600
It's not the Tiber,
but I like it.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.480
Where are you going?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.360
Bath time!

10:05.400 --> 10:07.080
Legionary?

10:07.120 --> 10:09.520
Take three men.
Stay close to the General.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.480
Aye, Praefectus.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.080
We are going to die

10:42.120 --> 10:44.200
so our general
can wash his balls.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.160
Oh, this is great.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.400
Great way to die.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.680
Where the fuck has he gone?

10:49.720 --> 10:50.560
What?

10:50.600 --> 10:52.560
Aw, shit.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.280
You have been warned,

11:10.320 --> 11:11.640
Aulus Plautius!

11:12.720 --> 11:15.000
Make amends!

11:26.480 --> 11:27.560
So you went mad,

11:27.600 --> 11:29.960
and the Druids cast you out.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.880
I didn't go mad.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.280
The Druids don't cast you out
for being mad.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.720
Being mad in the Druids
is practically a requirement.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.720
So why did they
throw you out?

11:39.760 --> 11:41.240
Because I was
possessed...

11:41.280 --> 11:42.240
by a demon.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.240
A demon?

11:43.280 --> 11:44.200
His name is Pwykka.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.400
Who's Pwykka?

11:45.440 --> 11:47.080
He's one
of the three Demon Kings.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.440
He sounds
important...

11:48.480 --> 11:49.760
but then,
you wouldn't be possessed

11:49.800 --> 11:51.400
by any old demon,
would you?

11:51.440 --> 11:52.560
Have you seen the Druids?

11:52.600 --> 11:54.520
Have you looked
in their eyes?

11:54.560 --> 11:56.040
To look a Druid
in the eye

11:56.080 --> 11:57.840
is to stare down
into the abyss,

11:57.880 --> 12:02.120
and the Druids are
afraid of Pwykka...

12:02.160 --> 12:05.080
so you never joke
about Pwykka...

12:06.960 --> 12:08.120
ever.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.080
Why didn't the Druids
just kill you?

12:17.120 --> 12:19.720
You can't
kill Pwykka.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.320
Pwykka's immortal.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.240
So...
he's still inside you.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.640
He's been asleep
for a year now...

12:27.400 --> 12:29.360
but with all these
rumblings,

12:29.400 --> 12:30.400
I feel him,

12:30.440 --> 12:32.840
stirring in his sleep.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.960
His nostrils can smell
the blood and the flames...

12:37.760 --> 12:40.920
but as long as he's in me,
I'm safe from the Druids.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.560
They can't touch me.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.200
Only when Pwykka leaves me,

12:47.240 --> 12:50.440
only then the Druids
can have their revenge.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.520
Then I'm really in trouble.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.160
Then they can do to me
what they want...

12:55.200 --> 12:56.920
and they will.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.240
So... here we are.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.680
Romans this way,
cave's that way.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.720
You will be safe there.

13:08.760 --> 13:09.520
Goodbye.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.720
Where's the cave?

13:11.760 --> 13:12.920
I said I'd take you
as far as the river.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.800
Well, where's the river?

13:13.840 --> 13:14.720
Ten miles that way.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.160
I'd take you myself,

13:16.200 --> 13:18.080
but I'd be wasting
really precious time.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.920
I need
to destroy the Romans.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.920
The path wanders a lot.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.360
You have to go
through Little Demon Wood,

13:25.400 --> 13:26.240
then east...

13:26.280 --> 13:27.240
No, no, no,
hold on. Stop.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.040
Little Demon Wood?

13:29.080 --> 13:30.560
It's the wood that's little...

13:30.600 --> 13:31.800
not the demon.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.000
Through Little Demon Wood.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.920
That leads
straight to Great Demon Wood.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.280
A bit scary.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.320
Climb down the cliffs
to a waterfall.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.280
Now, there are wolves
near the waterfall,

13:43.320 --> 13:45.960
but if you carry on
for a few miles,

13:46.000 --> 13:47.480
you'll see the cave.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.880
Safe journey!

13:52.920 --> 13:54.640
No, I'm not going to the cave.

13:54.680 --> 13:55.640
I'm coming to find the Romans
with you.

13:55.680 --> 13:56.440
No, you're not.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.520
Dad wasn't at home.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.360
He could have been
taken prisoner.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.440
Listen, I didn't want
to tell you this...

14:04.480 --> 14:06.440
but your dad's dead.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.600
I saw him get killed.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.320
He died a warrior.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.280
He was fighting?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.440
So bravely.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.760
You would have
been proud.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.080
No one brings weapons
to Solstice.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.320
It's forbidden.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.440
He must have disarmed a Roman.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.560
Was it a sword or spear?

14:37.680 --> 14:38.720
A sword.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.680
Which hand
was he fighting with?

14:40.720 --> 14:42.440
His...

14:42.480 --> 14:44.040
sword hand.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.320
Left or right?

14:49.880 --> 14:50.680
Right.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.960
You lying bastard!

14:52.000 --> 14:52.960
All right, I made it up,

14:53.000 --> 14:54.040
but you forced me to.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.480
You're not mad!

14:55.520 --> 14:57.600
You're just a bastard!
A lying bastard!

14:57.640 --> 15:00.320
I can't have
you with me.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.120
You slow me down!

15:02.160 --> 15:03.800
You'll get me caught.
That can't happen.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.440
You're evil!
You liar!

15:07.920 --> 15:09.320
My mission is huge.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.920
You don't see it!

15:10.960 --> 15:15.320
I'll find the fucking Romans
myself!

15:15.360 --> 15:16.200
That's my path.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.840
Not anymore!

15:17.880 --> 15:19.280
Find another.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.560
I knew that would work.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.240
It's a mountain fortress.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.720
Natural defenses, all flanks.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.320
High perimeter
for bowmen.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.640
Main fortress
is deep inside.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.000
You could garrison 3,000,
4,000, minimum.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.120
We take it over,

15:49.160 --> 15:52.200
we'd command
all the coastal tribes.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.960
Crugdunon is our
foothold in the south.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.040
Bring me one of the children.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.320
A boy.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.560
The gods have chosen.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.320
The first chance we get.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.320
Agreed?

16:31.360 --> 16:32.360
Agreed.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.320
What's your name?

16:39.360 --> 16:40.760
Innis.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.120
What about your king, Innis?
What's his name?

16:44.160 --> 16:45.760
King Pellenor.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.400
And is he an
honourable king?

16:47.440 --> 16:48.960
I only saw him once.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.480
He was very old.

16:51.960 --> 16:55.360
The Druids put runes
on his face.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.040
The runes?

16:57.080 --> 16:58.800
It's the King's story.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.280
And what is the story?

17:01.320 --> 17:03.280
Only the Druids know.

17:06.119 --> 17:09.040
What about me?
Do you know who I am?

17:09.079 --> 17:11.400
Mum says...

17:11.440 --> 17:12.400
What does
your mum say?

17:12.440 --> 17:14.440
You can tell me.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.440
Mum says you're a demon.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.000
And is she here with you,
your mum?

17:23.079 --> 17:25.520
What about your father?

17:25.560 --> 17:27.040
In the Underworld.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.320
How did he die?

17:32.360 --> 17:33.880
Your soldiers sent him there.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.680
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

17:47.280 --> 17:48.280
A warrior.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.600
A warrior?

17:51.480 --> 17:52.440
And who will
you fight?

17:52.480 --> 17:53.440
The Regni.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.480
Are they your enemy?

17:54.520 --> 17:55.640
The Regni
burned our home.

17:55.680 --> 17:58.080
They killed my hound.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.560
Now, Innis...

17:59.600 --> 18:01.880
this Underworld...

18:04.400 --> 18:06.720
has anyone ever been there
and come back?

18:06.760 --> 18:07.960
I mean, anybody you know?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.680
Only the Druids
can make that happen.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.160
Can I go now?

18:30.760 --> 18:31.840
Come here.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.560
Closer.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.040
Don't be afraid.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.080
Now...

18:50.120 --> 18:52.040
one more question,
and then you can go.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.400
Agreed?

19:00.080 --> 19:03.240
Tell me...

19:03.280 --> 19:05.400
about the Druids.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.440
Educational?

19:16.480 --> 19:18.600
Very.

19:18.640 --> 19:19.760
Optio!

19:19.800 --> 19:21.400
General.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.880
Start crucifying the prisoners.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.520
Two an hour, full show.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.320
We need news to get
to Pellenor fast.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.360
Yes, sir.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.560
Get yourself
two outriders.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.720
Saddle up.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.320
There's some people
I want you to visit.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.640
No, no, no!

19:48.880 --> 19:50.640
Take me!
He can't work!

19:51.920 --> 19:53.280
You want to come?

19:53.320 --> 19:54.840
He's too old to work.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.400
Then you come too.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.640
What are they building?

20:06.520 --> 20:09.040
No... No! No!

20:09.080 --> 20:10.080
You're next.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.920
They've started to
execute the prisoners.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.200
There's nothing
I can do.

21:43.240 --> 21:46.000
You can try and
change his mind.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.480
Father's mind is set.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.880
He wants to do this
like his forefathers did.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.840
No parley.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.840
Just out and out war.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.720
Our home is full to bursting.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.000
The children say

22:25.040 --> 22:26.080
there are warriors
asleep in the apple store.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.960
Crugdunon serves
its true purpose now.

22:30.520 --> 22:33.560
And yet, now that
Rome has returned,

22:33.600 --> 22:34.960
should we not be wary
of weakness...

22:36.880 --> 22:38.160
within these walls?

22:38.200 --> 22:40.160
Meaning?

22:50.720 --> 22:52.640
Your daughter, Kerra...

22:52.680 --> 22:53.640
I'm afraid...

22:53.680 --> 22:55.200
Afraid what?

22:57.240 --> 22:58.600
She keeps secrets from you.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.600
What secrets?

23:33.920 --> 23:35.200
I am Kerra,

23:35.240 --> 23:38.480
daughter of Pellenor,
King of the Cantii.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.240
I've come to speak
with your general.

23:55.760 --> 23:56.760
First time?

24:01.400 --> 24:04.240
I need your word,
as a general of Rome,

24:04.280 --> 24:05.880
that I have safe
parley here.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.240
You have it.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.560
You come to occupy us?

24:10.600 --> 24:12.120
We come to work with you,

24:12.160 --> 24:13.360
to make both our worlds better.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.520
How many crucifixions
does that take?

24:18.320 --> 24:20.160
Yesterday, I sent an envoy
to parley with your father.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.840
Today, he came back
with a flea in his ear.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.960
Now you're here.

24:26.000 --> 24:26.960
What happened?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.920
Did he change his mind?

24:28.960 --> 24:31.000
Does he even know you're here?

24:31.040 --> 24:33.160
Stop killing my people.
Then I'll talk.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.080
Forgive me, but about what?

24:39.560 --> 24:41.160
I asked to speak
with the King.

24:42.760 --> 24:45.360
Much as I'd like to spend
all afternoon talking to you,

24:45.400 --> 24:47.120
it's not what the
Emperor pays me for.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.120
My father listens to me.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.480
I see.

24:50.520 --> 24:51.520
You have his ear, do you?

24:52.680 --> 24:53.600
You influence him?

24:53.640 --> 24:54.720
I do.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.080
But he didn't send you here,
did he?

24:58.440 --> 24:59.560
No.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.120
I thought not.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.640
Not his style.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.160
Not if I know old Pellenor.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.560
Stop killing the prisoners.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.800
And in return?

25:09.840 --> 25:13.120
I will speak with my father.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.000
Optio!

25:16.600 --> 25:17.720
Aye, General.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.320
Cease the executions.

25:19.360 --> 25:20.360
Aye, General.

25:27.680 --> 25:29.400
Thank you.

25:30.800 --> 25:31.760
This morning,

25:31.800 --> 25:32.840
a young boy from
your tribe came here

25:32.880 --> 25:34.760
and told me a story.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.680
He said King Pellenor
had a beautiful young wife...

25:43.040 --> 25:44.080
and he loved her
with all his heart.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.360
Then one day, the Druids
came and told him

25:47.400 --> 25:49.640
his queen was cursed.

25:49.680 --> 25:53.880
She had Roman blood.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.800
Her grandfather
had been a Roman soldier,

25:55.840 --> 25:57.760
and she was part demon.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.000
She would seek
to destroy the King.

26:01.040 --> 26:04.400
So Pellenor summoned
his young wife...

26:06.520 --> 26:08.760
and had her flayed alive.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.440
I wonder what your Druids
think about you...

26:28.080 --> 26:29.840
so far.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
Tantalizing, isn't it?

27:45.760 --> 27:46.800
How long
were you following me?

27:46.840 --> 27:48.040
Since morning.

27:48.080 --> 27:48.960
These men
are Regni scouts.

27:50.880 --> 27:51.840
There could be
more around.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.240
I know another path.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.280
I can't take you any further.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.240
I know.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.560
I'll go back.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.080
Will you tell him?

28:09.120 --> 28:11.400
He's my king.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.400
I can't stop you.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.480
I just came back
from a ride into the Roman area.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.560
I saw their camp.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.720
Their general gave the order
to halt the crucifixions.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.160
What made him do this?

28:39.200 --> 28:40.920
I don't know.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.640
That's mine.

28:55.720 --> 28:56.960
Don't touch it.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.080
These scrolls...

28:59.120 --> 29:00.920
what are they?

29:00.960 --> 29:02.520
I don't know.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.080
Histories.
Stories.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.280
Roman stories.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.680
Yes!

29:06.720 --> 29:07.840
Yeah? How long
have you had them?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.600
Since I was a girl.
Mother gave them to me.

29:09.640 --> 29:10.880
Are you insane?

29:10.920 --> 29:12.600
You share
our mother's blood.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.320
All texts
are forbidden.

29:14.360 --> 29:15.360
They are the
work of devils.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.240
Where were you
today, mm?

29:19.280 --> 29:22.480
Where have you
been all day?

29:22.520 --> 29:24.240
I went to the Roman camp.

29:24.280 --> 29:25.760
I spoke with
their general.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.840
He agreed to stop
the crucifixions.

29:27.880 --> 29:28.880
Yeah?
In return for what?

29:28.920 --> 29:30.960
I just wanted
to buy us more time,

29:31.000 --> 29:32.240
and it worked.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.600
You know, he was right.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.440
You really are
like our mother.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.880
If he knew what
you just told me,

29:39.920 --> 29:44.160
and he knew that
I've kept it a secret,

29:44.200 --> 29:45.400
do you know what
he would do to me?

29:45.440 --> 29:47.200
Mm?

29:47.240 --> 29:51.000
He'd do the same
as he did to her.

29:59.320 --> 30:02.000
Enemy approaching!

30:02.040 --> 30:03.960
Enemy approaching!

30:09.040 --> 30:09.880
Move!

30:28.840 --> 30:30.720
Hold, steady now!

30:30.760 --> 30:32.400
Eyes front!

30:33.840 --> 30:34.840
Hold!

30:45.600 --> 30:47.800
Come on.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.720
Ready ballista fire!

31:26.720 --> 31:27.800
Loading!

31:38.000 --> 31:38.960
Take him out!

31:40.480 --> 31:41.560
Hold!

31:46.000 --> 31:47.440
That's a range finder,

31:47.480 --> 31:49.120
for the archers.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.120
I said "hold."

32:10.480 --> 32:11.720
That's the
Praefectus, sir.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.560
That's a parley pole.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.840
Good old Lucius Validus.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.800
They've come to talk.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.240
General Aulus Plautius,

32:52.280 --> 32:55.520
Commander of the Roman
9th Legatus Augusti,

32:55.560 --> 32:58.320
here by decree
of Emperor Claudius

32:58.360 --> 32:59.440
and the Senate of Rome.

32:59.480 --> 33:02.240
Queen Antedia of the Regni,
daughter of...

33:02.280 --> 33:05.400
Sit the fuck down, pretty boy.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.720
You've done enough
talking today.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.240
You are welcome here, Queen.

33:15.960 --> 33:18.680
I piss on this ground.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.680
Cantii soil makes my arse itch.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.120
I've got
20,000 warriors, 10,000 spears,

33:25.160 --> 33:27.120
too many bowmen
to count.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.960
I have ore, lands, forges

33:29.000 --> 33:30.920
and steel enough
to fight a hundred years.

33:30.960 --> 33:35.040
My fortress has springs,
wheat field, and cattle sheds.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.520
It's stocked and ready
for a ten-year siege.

33:37.560 --> 33:40.920
That's if you can get
anywhere near it,

33:40.960 --> 33:42.720
which I deeply doubt.

33:45.800 --> 33:48.280
So, what are you offering us
this time?

33:48.320 --> 33:50.560
Emperor Claudius
Tiberius Augustus

33:50.600 --> 33:52.960
would like you
to become citizens of Rome...

33:54.080 --> 33:55.520
and in return for
some modest taxation,

33:55.560 --> 33:57.720
he'd like you to continue
ruling your lands,

33:57.760 --> 34:00.200
worshipping your gods,

34:00.240 --> 34:02.840
and generally just carrying on,
tax issues aside,

34:02.880 --> 34:03.880
as fairly normal...

34:05.280 --> 34:08.440
but, and this is
the important part...

34:08.480 --> 34:11.000
as Romans,

34:11.040 --> 34:15.159
Emperor Claudius will
become your protector.

34:15.199 --> 34:18.719
Your enemies will
be our enemies...

34:18.760 --> 34:21.440
which is always bad for them

34:21.480 --> 34:22.840
and good for you.

34:25.320 --> 34:26.440
How does that sound?

34:26.480 --> 34:28.520
Take your time.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.320
Lots to think about.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.960
I know my mind.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.560
I have my own offer.

34:39.480 --> 34:40.760
Show him.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.240
You've seen
such a wound...

35:00.280 --> 35:01.600
your eunuchs...

35:03.040 --> 35:06.080
but not on my son.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.520
Not on my prince.

35:07.560 --> 35:11.880
Well, that's not good, but...

35:11.920 --> 35:13.640
I don't think even the Emperor
can help you there.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.600
Come here, my love.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.000
Who did this
abomination, Queen?

35:33.720 --> 35:35.560
Two summers ago,
the Druids came.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.320
They said the ancestors
wanted my boy

35:38.360 --> 35:40.520
to be the union
between Regni and Cantii...

35:40.560 --> 35:41.680
my only son.

35:41.720 --> 35:44.080
I refused.

35:44.120 --> 35:47.240
I said the ancestors would have
to tell me themselves.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.080
So I went there.

35:53.520 --> 35:56.000
I crossed over
to the other place...

35:57.560 --> 36:00.000
a harrowing trip...

36:01.520 --> 36:04.080
I met with my dead.

36:05.880 --> 36:06.960
They told me...

36:08.440 --> 36:09.360
"Marry him.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.480
Marry your son
to our enemy."

36:13.800 --> 36:15.760
I thought I'd sooner die,

36:15.800 --> 36:19.240
but I felt the strength
of my dead behind me.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.520
So I conceded to them.

36:23.560 --> 36:26.960
Kerra was his bride...

36:27.000 --> 36:28.840
daughter of Pellenor.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.480
On the night
of their wedding,

36:32.520 --> 36:34.200
in their bed,

36:34.240 --> 36:35.600
she took my boy
in her hand...

36:35.640 --> 36:36.600
gentle,

36:36.640 --> 36:40.640
with the sweetness
a wife should...

36:40.680 --> 36:42.920
until she had him hard,

36:42.960 --> 36:45.320
and then, with
her Cantii knife,

36:45.360 --> 36:47.120
she cut out
my future

36:47.160 --> 36:49.320
at the root.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.640
I heard his cries
from our camp...

36:51.680 --> 36:52.840
my boy,

36:52.880 --> 36:55.920
bleeding his life
into his wedding sheet.

36:55.960 --> 37:02.480
How could the gods
leave him so...

37:02.520 --> 37:05.800
and she who did this be gone?

37:05.840 --> 37:08.840
Had the gods
forsaken me?

37:08.880 --> 37:11.440
I could not understand...

37:14.120 --> 37:15.400
but now I do.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.160
You're here for my revenge.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.760
They sent you.

37:22.800 --> 37:23.960
The Regni will
accept you here,

37:24.000 --> 37:27.920
but only as allies
against the Cantii scum,

37:27.960 --> 37:29.760
if you will swear

37:29.800 --> 37:31.160
to deliver Kerra,

37:31.200 --> 37:33.600
daughter of Pellenor...

37:34.760 --> 37:37.160
to me...

37:37.200 --> 37:38.640
alive.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.800
Make sure
the men are fed.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.080
We'll ride
through the night.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.320
We'll set up camp

37:45.360 --> 37:47.960
within striking distance
of Crugdunon by dawn.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.880
You trust the Regni?

37:49.920 --> 37:52.440
Hatred
is far more reliable,

37:52.480 --> 37:54.480
and by God,
do these people hate.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.320
I need you to
lead the column.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.480
Maintain a loaded
march till dawn.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.920
What?

38:41.960 --> 38:43.840
What are you doing?

38:43.880 --> 38:46.000
I'll meet you
at the dawn camp.

38:46.040 --> 38:47.800
You have the command.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.160
Where are you going?

38:50.200 --> 38:51.520
General!

38:51.560 --> 38:53.320
There are strategic
elements to this mission

38:53.360 --> 38:54.800
I can't discuss,

38:54.840 --> 38:56.880
not even with you.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.000
You can't go out
there on your own.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.560
It's insane.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.440
Go with the General.

39:03.480 --> 39:04.840
Yes, sir.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.440
Here we go again.

40:12.480 --> 40:13.680
Look at us.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.200
Cocks in hand, walking
head of the column.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.600
Well, let's do this guy
now, like we said.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.280
Did he say
where he was going?

40:23.320 --> 40:24.320
You know
the General.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.560
What are you waiting for?

40:29.600 --> 40:31.840
I said I'd do it,
all right?

40:31.880 --> 40:33.760
If you don't have the balls,
don't draw the straw.

40:33.800 --> 40:34.880
Need to pick
my moment.

40:35.880 --> 40:36.680
Are you with us?

40:36.720 --> 40:38.560
Aye.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.960
So let's do it.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.440
Sir...

40:44.040 --> 40:45.800
we're not going
any further.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.120
Get back in line.

40:53.160 --> 40:54.160
I don't think so.

40:55.560 --> 40:56.920
Do it now.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.040
For God's sake, man!
Do it!

40:59.080 --> 41:01.760
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

41:14.840 --> 41:16.480
Hold your positions!

41:17.440 --> 41:18.360
Brutus!

41:19.440 --> 41:20.240
Hold!

41:20.280 --> 41:21.160
Get back here now!

41:21.200 --> 41:22.080
Formation!

41:36.000 --> 41:36.960
Let them come to us!

41:38.080 --> 41:39.560
Steady. Steady.

42:04.840 --> 42:06.600
With me! This way!

42:06.640 --> 42:07.680
Move! Move!

42:24.600 --> 42:25.720
Cowards!

42:25.760 --> 42:27.200
Alive!

42:30.480 --> 42:32.560
I want them alive.

42:44.320 --> 42:46.000
Camp here.

42:46.040 --> 42:47.880
If I'm not back by sunrise,
you join the others.

42:47.920 --> 42:48.920
You understand?

42:48.960 --> 42:50.480
Yes, sir.

42:52.760 --> 42:54.640
Fuck me.

43:48.680 --> 43:50.360
You got my map, then.

43:55.800 --> 43:59.200
You take a great risk
in coming here.

43:59.240 --> 44:01.120
You must be very brave.

44:03.880 --> 44:06.240
Or foolish.

44:10.400 --> 44:12.440
Then it better be worth it.

44:14.680 --> 44:17.160
Are you sure
you're ready, Rome?

44:17.200 --> 44:19.360
Ready for what you'll find?

44:24.760 --> 44:25.560
I'm ready.

44:27.440 --> 44:30.000
Then let's begin.

44:51.040 --> 44:53.320
He looks shiny,

44:53.360 --> 44:54.760
like a newborn baby.

44:54.800 --> 44:56.000
Our baby.

44:56.040 --> 44:58.040
Returned
from the underworld.

44:58.080 --> 45:00.400
We have a general.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.320
This man,

45:02.360 --> 45:05.320
his weapon is not the sword.

45:05.360 --> 45:07.840
His weapon is you.

45:07.880 --> 45:09.000
We are the dead.

45:09.880 --> 45:11.800
We are the dead!

45:11.840 --> 45:13.920
You know
Caesar's mistake?

45:13.960 --> 45:17.320
You don't defeat these people
by fighting their warriors.

45:18.840 --> 45:21.320
It's their gods
you've got to kill.
