00:03.862 --> 00:06.275
Spider-Man, do you know when
the new training sessions start?

00:06.300 --> 00:07.853
Uh, let me see if I can't
find that out for you.

00:07.892 --> 00:09.967
Is Director Fury ever returning?

00:10.003 --> 00:13.298
Of course, Iron Spider.
Sometime. Maybe. I hope.

00:13.345 --> 00:17.562
Is Hawkeye teaching advanced
marksmanship again, or is Widow?

00:17.587 --> 00:19.960
Listen, I'll get everyone
answers. Just chill.

00:25.723 --> 00:28.955
Scarlet, wanna switch costumes and
answer all these questions for me?

00:28.980 --> 00:30.757
I don't know how Nick Fury
ever did all this.

00:30.782 --> 00:33.427
Well, whoever said you
had to take Fury's place?

00:33.452 --> 00:35.666
No one's seen him or Nova
since the Hydra attack.

00:35.805 --> 00:38.210
But while he's gone, someone's
got to keep this place running.

00:38.227 --> 00:39.805
And that has to be you?

00:40.008 --> 00:42.098
Look, the world's a rough place,
and in the end,

00:42.209 --> 00:44.043
you just gotta look out for yourself.

00:44.079 --> 00:46.695
Well, Mr. Sunshine,
obviously you never downloaded

00:46.731 --> 00:48.489
your superhero instruction manual,

00:48.524 --> 00:51.058
because our job
is to help wherever we can.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.143
Yeah. Just like Agent Venom.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.180
And look where that got him.

00:56.335 --> 00:57.922
Agent Venom got hurt in battle,

00:57.947 --> 01:00.481
and it was my fault for not
being a strong enough leader.

01:01.077 --> 01:03.165
Face it, Spidey, you're no Nick Fury.

01:03.239 --> 01:04.538
You're not even Aunt May.

01:04.574 --> 01:08.133
Oh, no, Aunt May! I was
supposed to call her days ago!

01:08.158 --> 01:10.189
I am the worst
superhero-slash-nephew

01:10.214 --> 01:12.554
in the history
of superhero-slash-nephews.

01:13.330 --> 01:15.352
[ringing]

01:15.736 --> 01:16.499
[beeps]

01:16.666 --> 01:18.622
Well, if it isn't Peter Parker.

01:18.647 --> 01:20.671
Taking a break from saving the world?

01:20.719 --> 01:23.451
Sorry I've been out of touch.
Things have been a little crazy.

01:23.476 --> 01:27.595
Same here. I simply cannot keep
my plants alive during this drought.

01:27.632 --> 01:30.431
Oh, thank you, Aunt May.
Finally, some normal problems.

01:30.457 --> 01:33.628
No mega-villains, no giant monsters.
This is perfect.

01:33.653 --> 01:35.873
My garden dying is perfect?

01:35.898 --> 01:38.835
[alarm blaring] Oh, not now. I'm sorry!

01:38.860 --> 01:40.945
<i>Invest in
drought-resistant plants!</i>

01:40.970 --> 01:43.295
- <i>Gotta go!</i>
- Oh, okay, Peter.

01:44.143 --> 01:46.510
A distress signal?
Where's it coming from?

01:46.535 --> 01:50.214
Some off-site facility, but I can't find
it listed anywhere in the SHIELD database.

01:50.239 --> 01:53.251
Unlisted facility?
Is it Fury calling for help?

01:53.411 --> 01:55.517
Maybe it's time for a field trip.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.917
Uh, when you said, "Going on a
mission in the Spider-Jet,"

02:03.942 --> 02:07.934
I was thinking, K'un L'un,
Asgard, Coney Island...

02:08.077 --> 02:12.437
But no. We're at a mall. In Queens.
That's closed.

02:12.462 --> 02:14.362
I bet this isn't a real mall.

02:14.601 --> 02:16.297
Seems like every abandoned
building in New York

02:16.322 --> 02:18.133
turns out to be a secret SHIELD base.

02:18.158 --> 02:21.835
Or Hydra. This entire excursion
could be nothing but a trap.

02:26.145 --> 02:28.248
A trap would at least be exciting.

02:28.902 --> 02:31.014
This mall doesn't even have an arcade.

02:31.289 --> 02:32.386
Boring.

02:32.419 --> 02:33.460
[buzz]

02:33.495 --> 02:34.380
Wha...

02:38.155 --> 02:41.543
Attention shoppers,
you will be destroyed.

02:41.579 --> 02:43.090
[grunts]

02:43.876 --> 02:46.101
Hey, Miles, still bored?

02:58.367 --> 02:59.161

02:59.186 --> 03:00.587
This mall is killer!

03:00.612 --> 03:02.754
Did I just say that out loud? Aah!

03:04.501 --> 03:08.345
The system has to have a structural
weakness somewhere. They all do.

03:09.306 --> 03:10.251
Aah!

03:10.946 --> 03:12.536
Aah! Whoa!

03:13.961 --> 03:15.721
Worst mall ever!

03:24.863 --> 03:29.299
- I had that under complete control!
- Right. Looked like it.

03:30.316 --> 03:31.842
[all grunt]

03:32.160 --> 03:33.226
[grunts]

03:35.414 --> 03:37.922
Okay, I'm gonna guess
these glorified mall guards

03:37.947 --> 03:40.496
are protecting something more
important than the food court.

03:43.965 --> 03:45.165
What are you doing?

03:45.190 --> 03:47.612
I'm checking the directory
for a SHIELD secret hideout.

03:47.647 --> 03:49.514
- Ugh!
- What? It's worth a shot.

03:49.539 --> 03:51.551
We need to use deductive reasoning.

03:51.576 --> 03:54.776
Find a storefront that isn't locked up.
The barber shop.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.299
Good thinking.

03:56.662 --> 03:59.796
Look for any triggers
or pulleys or secret combs.

03:59.831 --> 04:03.852
Ugh! You really think SHIELD's
gonna put a secret hideout in a...

04:03.877 --> 04:04.893
Whoa!

04:04.928 --> 04:06.127
[all] Aaahh!

04:06.152 --> 04:08.251
[Kid Arachnid] I hate this mall!

04:08.777 --> 04:10.070
[thud] [all grunt]

04:13.003 --> 04:16.878
[Scarlet Spider] You have half a second
to get off me before I skewer you.

04:16.903 --> 04:18.069
[Iron Spider] Getting!

04:19.228 --> 04:21.815
[Spider-Man] Guys, relax.
If Fury is down here,

04:21.839 --> 04:23.973
do you want him to see us
acting like a bunch of kids?

04:24.081 --> 04:26.137
We are a bunch of kids.

04:26.659 --> 04:27.995
Not my point.

04:29.284 --> 04:31.838
Well, if Fury was looking
for some alone time,

04:31.863 --> 04:34.623
this takes isolation
to an entirely new level.

04:34.666 --> 04:37.833
You might actually be right
on this one, Spider-Man.

04:41.718 --> 04:42.572
[grunts]

04:42.607 --> 04:44.169
[grunting]

04:44.227 --> 04:45.294
No use.

04:45.319 --> 04:48.085
- It appears to be vacuum sealed.
- How do we get in?

04:48.233 --> 04:51.204
I've got a crazy idea
called the "front door."

04:51.229 --> 04:52.000
[beeps]

04:54.299 --> 04:55.893
How do you have access?

04:55.918 --> 04:58.591
Clearly Nick Fury respects
my command and authority.

04:59.944 --> 05:02.122
Okay, I don't have a single clue.

05:04.227 --> 05:07.631
- Exciting enough for you now?
- I've still seen better malls.

05:09.443 --> 05:12.915
Is it just me, or does this place
feel a little odd to you guys?

05:12.940 --> 05:16.470
No, not at all,
if we're in a horror movie.

05:16.495 --> 05:18.924
Okay. I know a haunted
house when I see one.

05:18.924 --> 05:20.997
[Iron Spider] There are
no such things as ghosts.

05:21.022 --> 05:24.221
Shh! The ghosts will hear you.

05:24.676 --> 05:27.249
Hmm. Some sort of blast door.

05:27.274 --> 05:29.129
Perhaps a fail-safe hatch?

05:29.539 --> 05:31.625
Fury could be trapped
behind there, hurt.

05:31.712 --> 05:34.165
Let's open it.
But just be ready for anything.

05:34.441 --> 05:35.794
[beeps]

05:43.518 --> 05:46.987
Okay, so, now I know ghosts watch TV.

05:47.021 --> 05:49.175
Be alert.
Somebody was just here.

05:49.191 --> 05:51.541
You can't deduce that
from a television.

05:51.577 --> 05:54.009
No, but I can from
that half-eaten sandwich.

05:54.108 --> 05:56.349
Hello, paranormal being!

05:56.374 --> 05:59.372
We don't want your sandwich.
It's all good!

05:59.584 --> 06:01.496
Why is it so humid in here?

06:04.576 --> 06:05.719
[grunts]

06:07.224 --> 06:11.089
Wow. You really showed
that water who's boss.

06:11.114 --> 06:13.382
Yes. Very threatening.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.797
I don't know.
Something's up, guys.

06:15.822 --> 06:18.855
Yeah, like SHIELD needs
to pay its plumbing bill?

06:18.880 --> 06:21.662
Maybe that distress signal
was just a computer glitch.

06:21.681 --> 06:25.880
Maybe. Or Fury was here,
but had to leave in a hurry?

06:27.396 --> 06:29.529
[grunts] I told you!

06:29.565 --> 06:31.930
Haunted g-g-ghost water!

06:32.138 --> 06:33.129
What? [Gasps]

06:33.786 --> 06:35.911
[all grunt]

06:42.743 --> 06:46.050
One thing's for sure...
That is not Nick Fury!

06:47.733 --> 06:49.599
[grunts]

06:49.866 --> 06:51.717
Let them go, Wet-Willie!

06:51.742 --> 06:54.967
No chance.
And that's not my name!

06:54.991 --> 06:56.292
Sorry, Waterboy!

06:56.317 --> 06:58.387
It's not like you bothered
to introduce yourself!

06:58.796 --> 06:59.776
[grunts]

07:01.718 --> 07:03.557
You're the ones attacking me!

07:06.429 --> 07:08.959
Attacking you? Is this opposite day?

07:09.101 --> 07:10.048
[grunts]

07:11.958 --> 07:14.910
Made of water? That's
just hydrogen and oxygen.

07:15.107 --> 07:16.713
I might have a trick for that.

07:18.597 --> 07:20.760
[both grunt]

07:20.785 --> 07:23.094
I didn't know ghosts
could be made of water!

07:23.119 --> 07:25.918
For the last time, he is not a ghost!

07:26.096 --> 07:26.890
[grumbling]

07:26.915 --> 07:29.833
- I hate being wet!
- You hate everything.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.212
[whooshing]

07:32.204 --> 07:34.762
And you guys made fun of me
for webbing that water!

07:34.805 --> 07:36.431
Waiting for my apology!

07:39.508 --> 07:40.712
Whoa.

07:40.935 --> 07:45.021
Maybe he finally moved on
into the ghostly dimension.

07:45.057 --> 07:47.886
- Buh-bye, ghost.
- Oh!

07:51.741 --> 07:54.302
Who is this guy?
Can you even punch water?

07:54.327 --> 07:56.622
How do we stop him?
A giant sponge?

07:56.647 --> 07:59.711
Really wishing I had Fury-sense
instead of Spidey-sense right now.

07:59.841 --> 08:01.622
Fury would know how to contain him.

08:03.021 --> 08:04.255
[grunts]

08:04.489 --> 08:08.704
Did you say "Fury"? Nick Fury?
Where is he?

08:08.739 --> 08:10.038
We were hoping he was here.

08:10.063 --> 08:12.474
You four... You work for SHIELD?

08:12.499 --> 08:14.718
Yeah. You got a problem
with that, punk?

08:14.743 --> 08:17.563
Allies of Nick Fury. Sorry.

08:17.588 --> 08:18.948
Maybe I shouldn't have fought you.

08:18.973 --> 08:20.245
My name's Morris.

08:20.786 --> 08:24.177
I have to say, in those costumes,
I didn't think you belonged down here.

08:24.582 --> 08:26.238
I was going to capture you for Nick.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.343
So, you're friends with Fury?

08:28.368 --> 08:30.210
He's the only one who knows about my...

08:30.235 --> 08:31.813
work down here.

08:31.838 --> 08:33.219
Which is what exactly?

08:33.244 --> 08:35.724
Trying to control my volatile nature.

08:35.755 --> 08:38.097
Nick wanted to keep my powers secret.

08:38.123 --> 08:39.669
He does like secrets, doesn't he?

08:39.693 --> 08:41.284
What about the distress signal?

08:41.326 --> 08:43.629
Odd. I never sent one,

08:43.654 --> 08:45.465
but I'm glad you investigated.

08:45.490 --> 08:46.971
Since Nick stopped showing up,

08:47.177 --> 08:49.360
I was worried no one
would ever come down here.

08:49.396 --> 08:52.423
Yeah, well, this is the most fortified
shopping mall I've ever seen.

08:52.504 --> 08:53.835
Why so much protection?

08:53.860 --> 08:55.804
Nick was afraid
someone would capture me.

08:55.829 --> 08:59.177
He said names like Octavius and Osborn.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.510
- Sound familiar?
- Uh-huh.

09:01.535 --> 09:03.935
Unfortunately, they're not
the latest boy band.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.581
Look, we don't know
when Fury's coming back,

09:05.606 --> 09:07.002
but we can't leave you down here.

09:07.137 --> 09:08.973
We better get you back
to the Triskelion.

09:09.090 --> 09:13.038
I suppose if Nick Fury
trusts you, then so should I.

09:15.781 --> 09:18.041
So, you're sure you're not a ghost?

09:18.066 --> 09:19.147
Pretty sure.

09:19.172 --> 09:20.587
Now, look at this.

09:20.703 --> 09:23.085
Usually us Spiders come in,
webs blazing.

09:23.110 --> 09:25.332
But thinking like Nick Fury
has its advantages.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.448
What a nice guy
Morris turned out to be.

09:27.473 --> 09:30.913
Uh-oh. Just hacked into
Fury's private files.

09:31.033 --> 09:33.633
I don't think our friend
back there's a very nice guy.

09:33.658 --> 09:35.672
[Spider-Man] Why? His story adds up.

09:35.743 --> 09:38.525
Fury was taking care of him, and
now that he's gone, it's on me.

09:38.550 --> 09:40.799
Got something. Hydro...

09:40.980 --> 09:45.487
- Man. Oh. He's bad.
- Any chance you mean "bad" as in "good"?

09:45.512 --> 09:48.480
He wasn't being taken care of by Fury.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.139
They had him in solitary.

09:50.541 --> 09:52.761
- Top secret.
- Okay.

09:52.786 --> 09:55.043
So in trying to be a good
leader like Nick Fury,

09:55.145 --> 09:58.297
I just did exactly the opposite
of what a good leader would do.

09:58.332 --> 09:59.863
Go, me. [Chuckles nervously]

09:59.888 --> 10:01.955
Gotta make this right
before it gets worse.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.580
Why are we turning around?

10:10.117 --> 10:12.914
What? Heh. We're not turning around.

10:13.788 --> 10:15.333
[nervous laughter]

10:17.670 --> 10:19.836
Don't play games with me!

10:20.834 --> 10:22.010
[grunts]

10:23.148 --> 10:24.022
[grunting]

10:24.058 --> 10:25.681
[struggling]

10:25.706 --> 10:28.210
[Hydro-Man] So you figured it all out?

10:28.446 --> 10:30.893
- Took ya long enough!
- On the plus side,

10:30.918 --> 10:33.027
Hydro-Man is a way cooler name
than Morris.

10:33.052 --> 10:34.666
[Scarlet Spider] I hate water!

10:34.872 --> 10:37.458
[both struggling]
Until I can destroy Fury myself,

10:37.505 --> 10:40.216
I'll have to settle on
destroying his little helpers.

10:40.247 --> 10:41.716
Whoa! Agh!

10:42.505 --> 10:44.707
He shorted out the instrument panel.

10:45.068 --> 10:45.669
[grunts]

10:45.693 --> 10:47.336
I've lost control!

10:49.365 --> 10:50.799
[Spider-Man] We gotta contain him!

10:51.943 --> 10:53.125
[grunts]

10:54.797 --> 10:55.613
[grunting]

10:55.638 --> 10:56.380
[Spider-Man] Whoa!

10:56.415 --> 10:57.876
[grunts ] [moaning]

10:59.368 --> 11:03.537
Thanks for busting me out.
Have a bumpy ride.

[grunts]

11:18.153 --> 11:20.969
Wait! Where's Cho? Cho?

11:21.467 --> 11:23.842
It took me three whole days
to build this thing.

11:23.867 --> 11:25.834
I am not gonna crash it.

11:34.370 --> 11:35.602
[Scarlet Spider laughing]

11:35.627 --> 11:38.597
Crashing might have been smoother
than one of your landings.

11:38.622 --> 11:41.440
At least it's in one piece.
Well, mostly.

11:41.465 --> 11:43.634
Wait. I know this neighborhood.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.809
[Hydro-Man] You can't
stop me, Spider-Man!

11:52.759 --> 11:56.172
Fury's gonna pay for keeping me
in prison all these years!

11:56.197 --> 11:59.342
Yeah. Can't imagine why he'd
want you behind bars.

12:02.750 --> 12:05.098

12:05.134 --> 12:09.923
♪ Down came the rain
and washed the spiders out. ♪

12:10.540 --> 12:14.003
Okay, that's definitely
my least favorite nursery rhyme.

12:21.809 --> 12:24.401
So, not only do I free
a dangerous SHIELD prisoner,

12:24.437 --> 12:26.503
I bring him to the street
my Aunt May lives on.

12:26.539 --> 12:29.210
Is there an award

You spiders are
just as tenacious as Fury,

12:46.165 --> 12:48.344
but clearly not as smart!

12:48.391 --> 12:49.157
Whoa!

12:49.182 --> 12:50.036
[Grunts]

12:50.061 --> 12:51.884
We gotta shut this guy down.

Any idea how?

Heads up, slow drip!

13:20.456 --> 13:21.256
[grunts]

13:21.280 --> 13:23.606
Okay, Fury would assess the situation,

13:23.631 --> 13:25.765
delegate orders, and keep a cool head.

13:26.178 --> 13:27.250
Cool?

13:28.703 --> 13:31.040
Cool! Ice, I got it!

13:34.031 --> 13:36.038
Iron Spider, get back to SHIELD,

13:36.063 --> 13:38.013
have them shut the water
down in this area.

13:38.038 --> 13:40.452
Then grab all the freeze webs
we have in the armory.

he couldn't control me.

Aw, but I can't leave! I'm in charge.

by freeing that menace.

Scarlet, I need to trust you
with something.

My Aunt May lives two blocks up.

You need to warn her
and get her to safety.

14:36.927 --> 14:38.112
Aunt May?

14:38.332 --> 14:41.134
All this time I've had to hide
my identity to protect my family.

Now I have to reveal it
to protect them.

I trust, it's Scarlet Spider.

Peter grew up here.

So you're the one who made him
so dangerously selfless?

Yeah, well being a hero can
put you in a lot of danger.

Yes. I think that fits.

Maybe. Maybe it does.

Heh. Nick Fury who?

Without him, I kind of had to
rise to the challenge on my own.

Who knew?

20:23.742 --> 20:24.664
I did.

20:25.022 --> 20:27.913
And who knew a maniac super-villain
would help water your garden?

When are results back

Results will post tomorrow morning,

Excellent, tell them if
they need additional help

20:43.974 --> 20:45.460
they can pull from Division 3.

Seems like you've got
everything under control.

Even Venom is getting better.
Not bad, punk.

Look at you, Ben, giving
compliments like a nice person.

and if it wasn't Hydro-Man...

How much you wanna bet it was Doc Ock?

And we just broke out a new
member of his Sinister Six.

21:17.284 --> 21:20.051
Heh. So much for having
everything under control.

21:20.539 --> 21:22.456
If there's one thing
this battle just showed me,

if anyone can turn a set-back
into a win, it's us.

21:25.562 --> 21:28.084
But Doc Ock's becoming
more powerful than ever.

21:28.109 --> 21:30.582
And we're the only ones
who can stop him!
