Well...

whoever it is, I'm guessing they don't
get invited to the block party.

01:33.397 --> 01:36.064
We're on

You got everything to the east where
no one ever misses an election there.

01:50.948 --> 01:53.198
- 'Cause they give a shit, right?
- This year, they do for sure.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.033
You're not an easy man
to catch up with, Councilman.

01:55.035 --> 01:56.668
I've been calling to talk
with you for a few days.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.337
Yeah, well, you know
how these campaigns go.

01:58.339 --> 01:59.838
We're always
running somewhere.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.790
Speaking of which,
we're late for some radio we have to do.

02:01.792 --> 02:03.125
Oh, come on,
Councilman.

02:03.127 --> 02:04.510
Couple questions
and I'm out of your hair.

02:04.512 --> 02:06.044
Yeah? What would
be the point?

02:06.046 --> 02:08.380
The point?
It's an election, you're running.

02:08.382 --> 02:11.383
- I'm covering it.
- Yeah, for "The New York Times."

02:11.385 --> 02:13.852
See, if you were one of the
Yonkers guys, I'd talk to you.

02:13.854 --> 02:15.721
- You know why?
- No, why?

02:15.723 --> 02:17.606
Because that would mean
that you lived in Yonkers,

02:17.608 --> 02:20.359
that you worked in Yonkers
like me, like they do.

02:20.361 --> 02:23.028
All you guys telling us
what you think we should do,

02:23.030 --> 02:24.646
you're all actually
from someplace else.

02:24.648 --> 02:27.566
You know that judge,
he lives in Westchester.

02:27.568 --> 02:31.119
And Sussman and them lawyers,
they live where they do.

02:31.121 --> 02:34.573
You know, I'm guessing you got yourself a
nice little place in Manhattan somewhere

02:34.575 --> 02:36.408
or Park Slope, huh?
Am I right?

02:36.410 --> 02:39.578
But you see, we live here.

02:41.048 --> 02:43.165
And when I pick up a copy
of "The New York Times"

02:43.167 --> 02:45.250
and I read what
you are writing about me

02:45.252 --> 02:47.586
and about this kid mayor
who's gone all wet

02:47.588 --> 02:49.671
and about
the housing thing,

02:49.673 --> 02:52.975
I know that it's got nothing to do
with what's going on here.

02:52.977 --> 02:54.426
And what's going on?

02:54.428 --> 02:58.146
People working for their homes,
their neighborhoods.

02:58.148 --> 02:59.765
They want to keep
what they have.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.650
And you really think
that building a couple hundred units

03:01.652 --> 03:03.569
of public housing is gonna
wreck those neighborhoods?

03:03.571 --> 03:05.604
Yeah, I do.
And the voters do, too.

you were a cop.

05:42.396 --> 05:43.762
Yeah,
Westchester County

05:43.764 --> 05:46.064
until I decided I needed
a bigger gun and I went to law school.

05:46.066 --> 05:47.399
You see how that
turned out.

05:47.401 --> 05:48.734
All right,
what's the bad news?

05:52.156 --> 05:54.606

05:54.608 --> 05:55.824

05:55.826 --> 05:59.111
Holy Jesus.
Really?

05:59.113 --> 06:01.613
I'm sorry, I've just been riding around
in forests of Spallone signs.

06:01.615 --> 06:03.615
I'm finding it
hard to believe.

06:03.617 --> 06:06.785
Citywide, we've got 48% who support
accepting Judge Sands' housing order.

06:06.787 --> 06:08.837
Only 39% want the city
to still keep fighting it.

06:08.839 --> 06:10.589
Yeah, and 12%
with no opinion.

06:10.591 --> 06:13.592
How the fuck does 12% of Yonkers
not have an opinion on the housing?

06:13.594 --> 06:15.627
I mean, where do they find these people?
Under fucking rocks?

06:15.629 --> 06:18.380
On the issue, you've won.
Spallone's flogging a dead horse here.

06:20.551 --> 06:22.801
You know something?
I ride around this city,

06:22.803 --> 06:25.303
I look at all the signs,
I hear these people yelling,

06:25.305 --> 06:27.773
but you forget

06:27.775 --> 06:31.810
that there's like this whole
silent majority out there.

06:31.812 --> 06:34.646
Especially when you got these other
bastards shitting on you every day.

06:36.233 --> 06:38.533
Spallone's got to know
about these numbers, right?

06:38.535 --> 06:40.702
I mean, this has got to take the wind
right out of his sails.

06:40.704 --> 06:43.205
He and his people probably have some idea
how far he's trailing, yeah.

06:43.207 --> 06:44.990
But I bet
the money people don't.

06:44.992 --> 06:47.075
Of course, we could
enlighten them.

06:48.579 --> 06:49.795
Like leak the poll?

06:52.332 --> 06:53.999

Yo, I'm telling you
I ain't good enough for you.

07:18.025 --> 07:20.158

10:42.729 --> 10:45.196
I'm gonna need twice that
and then some come November

10:45.198 --> 10:49.367
when all the Neanderthals
crawl out of the woodwork for Spallone.

10:49.369 --> 10:52.904
Plus who knows how much of a fight
Iannacone's gonna put in the primary now

10:52.906 --> 10:55.874
or how much money Ralph Arred's gonna put
behind him just to derail me.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.412
Well, if politics
were easy,

11:00.414 --> 11:02.047
everyone would be
in politics.

11:02.049 --> 11:04.883
Bullshit. Nobody sensible would ever
put themselves through this.

11:10.807 --> 11:13.258
Oh, God.

11:13.260 --> 11:15.760
This question
of individual right

11:15.762 --> 11:18.813
is being trampled on
by an unfair judge.

11:18.815 --> 11:20.932
Judge Sands, this--

11:20.934 --> 11:23.268
this philosopher king.

11:23.270 --> 11:27.522
Now it's time we restored
the people's government to Yonkers.

11:27.524 --> 11:29.774
And I promise you,

11:29.776 --> 11:32.327
I will continue to appeal

11:32.329 --> 11:34.779
against this off-the-wall
judge's decision

11:34.781 --> 11:36.531
to the Supreme Court

11:36.533 --> 11:38.666
and I will
unconditionally oppose

11:38.668 --> 11:40.618
construction
of public housing.

11:40.620 --> 11:43.121
We've all seen
what this mayor has done.

11:43.123 --> 11:47.258
It's time you recognized
your failure as a leader.

11:47.260 --> 11:49.544
- And if the good people of Yonkers
vote for you again... <i>- Time.</i>

11:49.546 --> 11:52.297
- ...you will be a disaster upon this city.
- Time, Mr. Spallone.

11:52.299 --> 11:54.466
Mr. Wasicsko.

11:54.468 --> 11:56.968
Ahem. Uh, certainly.

11:56.970 --> 11:59.971
My opponent
is a one-dimensional candidate.

11:59.973 --> 12:03.141
He can only talk about
one issue, housing,

12:03.143 --> 12:05.810
and he doesn't even get
that right most of the time.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.896
He keeps trying to dupe
the people of Yonkers

12:07.898 --> 12:11.449
by telling them that the Supreme Court
can change the situation,

12:11.451 --> 12:14.369
but the Supreme Court
has already ruled

12:14.371 --> 12:17.989
on all issues of liability
and remedy in this case.

12:17.991 --> 12:20.625
That is forever closed.
Yet Mr. Spallone,

12:20.627 --> 12:23.294
in order to advance his own
personal political career,

12:23.296 --> 12:25.964
is willing to bankrupt
the entire city in the process.

12:25.966 --> 12:29.834
There is a silent
majority out there

12:29.836 --> 12:32.137
that's ready to put
this issue behind them

12:32.139 --> 12:34.923
because they know that there's
more important issues in this election.

12:34.925 --> 12:37.342
But they are being
intimidated by the mob

12:37.344 --> 12:39.394
which is the loud minority.

12:39.396 --> 12:41.813
Well, it's time for
the good people of Yonkers

12:41.815 --> 12:44.732
to take back the ground
lost by these--

12:44.734 --> 12:47.685
this very narrow
lunatic fringe element.

12:53.193 --> 12:55.527
I got endorsed by
"The New York Times."

12:55.529 --> 12:57.412
I get endorsed
by Moynihan,

12:57.414 --> 13:00.248
by Governor Cuomo.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.834
I got the teachers,
I got the unions,

13:02.836 --> 13:05.203
and I kicked his ass
in the debate.

13:06.957 --> 13:08.423
What the fuck
does it take?

13:08.425 --> 13:11.125
Whatever happens,
you know you did the right thing.

13:11.127 --> 13:13.211
And if you lose,
it won't be to stop the housing.

13:13.213 --> 13:15.096
It'll be to punish you.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.348
You see that,
why can't they?

13:17.350 --> 13:19.717
Well, they aren't
in love with you.

13:19.719 --> 13:21.769
Why?

13:21.771 --> 13:23.721
Why aren't they?
I'm lovable.

13:23.723 --> 13:26.641
- Yeah, to me.
- To everybody.

13:26.643 --> 13:28.860
I'm the most lovable
politician in America.

13:28.862 --> 13:30.862
That says next to nothing.

13:30.864 --> 13:32.564
Oh, come on.
Don't go there.

13:32.566 --> 13:35.400
There are plenty
of lovable politicians.

13:35.402 --> 13:37.569
Reagan is a lovable
politician.

13:37.571 --> 13:40.154
FDR, Tip O'Neill,
Kennedy.

13:40.156 --> 13:41.789
Lovable, lovable, lovable.

13:41.791 --> 13:43.992
Ed Koch.
He's a fat, wrinkly fuck

13:43.994 --> 13:46.244
and they love his lovable ass
down the river.

13:46.246 --> 13:47.662
Hey, how am I doing?

13:49.633 --> 13:51.416
Really, what--

13:51.418 --> 13:53.251
how am I not lovable?

13:54.588 --> 13:55.970
You are.

13:57.591 --> 14:00.258
You think I'm gonna share
a bed with Ed Koch

14:00.260 --> 14:02.176
or Tip O'Neill?

14:02.178 --> 14:03.428
Or Kennedy?

14:03.430 --> 14:05.480
Kennedy I might.

14:05.482 --> 14:08.433
- He's dead, Nay.

14:41.851 --> 14:44.602
Yeah, but it might be

15:46.783 --> 15:48.866
Give me that shit.

15:52.205 --> 15:55.006
...now declaring
David Dinkins the winner

15:55.008 --> 15:57.959
over Rudy Giuliani
in the race for mayor of New York.

15:57.961 --> 16:00.011

16:00.013 --> 16:02.380

16:06.936 --> 16:09.354
<i>Dinkins' apparent win</i>
<i>means that voters today</i>

16:09.356 --> 16:11.556
<i>elected the first</i>
<i>black mayor of New York.</i>

16:11.558 --> 16:13.224
With nearly
all of the districts

16:13.226 --> 16:15.643
reporting to you live,
Dinkins is leading...

16:15.645 --> 16:17.862
Okay. Thank you.

16:22.235 --> 16:25.153
Well, that's
the ball game.

16:25.155 --> 16:26.454
What do you mean?

16:26.456 --> 16:28.489
East Side results
are still out,

16:28.491 --> 16:31.576
West Side is almost all in and
I'm down a couple thousand, so...

16:31.578 --> 16:34.245
- Is he sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, he's sure.

16:35.749 --> 16:37.048
Sorry, Ma.

16:37.050 --> 16:39.584
Your son is now
the youngest ex-mayor in America.

16:39.586 --> 16:43.137
Nicky, it's just
a bump in the road.

16:43.139 --> 16:46.591
Yeah, Nick, who knows, maybe you'll take
the mayor's seat back after two years.

16:46.593 --> 16:48.426
I need an honest job.

16:50.397 --> 16:53.347
I gotta find something for you
outside the mayor's office.

16:53.349 --> 16:56.434
Out of civil service.
Maybe Parking Authority.

16:56.436 --> 16:57.685
You, too, Mike.

16:57.687 --> 17:00.655
<i>There's a YPA spot</i>
<i>open on the board.</i>

17:00.657 --> 17:03.441
Finally get you that cushy job
I promised you.

17:05.662 --> 17:07.862
<i>- Here it is, Nick.</i>
<i>- ...in the race for mayor of Yonkers...</i>

17:07.864 --> 17:09.864
- Here we go.
- <i> ...Democratic incumbent Nicholas...</i>

17:09.866 --> 17:12.282
Break out the parachutes,
everybody,

17:12.285 --> 17:14.836
'cause this plane's
going down.

17:16.623 --> 17:18.372
<i>At this point, Spallone...</i>

17:18.374 --> 17:21.008
The fact is that this was not
an easy time for Yonkers,

17:21.010 --> 17:25.128
but I am honored to have served
my city when it needed me

17:25.131 --> 17:26.631
and I have no regrets.

17:26.633 --> 17:29.517
Thank you.

17:29.519 --> 17:31.385
You know how you know you're doing
the right thing in Yonkers?

17:31.387 --> 17:33.271
- No, how?
- They make you pay for it.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.391
If there was a hero in any of this,
it was Nick.

17:37.393 --> 17:41.195
Show me a hero
and I will write you a tragedy.

17:41.197 --> 17:43.731
You come up
with that one?

17:43.733 --> 17:46.651
I wish.
Fitzgerald said that.

17:46.653 --> 17:48.152
Who, the guy
from New Rochelle?

17:48.154 --> 17:50.037
The one who's running
for state Senate?

17:50.039 --> 17:51.989
...in any way I might
be able to help to do so.

17:51.991 --> 17:55.159
And I will be
at Mr. Spallone's disposal.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.961
Thank you for all
your hard work.

17:59.048 --> 18:01.165
And furthermore,
we have been right

18:01.167 --> 18:02.967
and we are still right.

18:02.969 --> 18:05.586
I believe the decisions
of the Supreme Court

18:05.588 --> 18:07.305
will come down
in our favor

18:07.307 --> 18:09.674
and we will have struck
a blow against the housing.

18:11.344 --> 18:13.177
But if the decision
is not in our favor,

18:13.179 --> 18:14.645
then we will abide
by the decision.

18:14.647 --> 18:17.181
- But we will see this appeal...
- What did he say?

18:17.183 --> 18:19.650
- <i> ...right through to the end.</i>
- What did he mean "abide by"?

18:21.437 --> 18:24.822
Now, I'm being told
that this housing fight is over.

18:24.824 --> 18:27.692
<i>- No!</i>
- Well, for as long as these decisions

18:27.694 --> 18:31.662
are before the Supreme Court,
they are very real.

18:40.707 --> 18:41.756
- Hey, Pete.
- Hey.

18:41.758 --> 18:43.040
Come on in.
Have a seat.

18:43.042 --> 18:44.258
<i>- Hi, Peter.</i>
- Oh, no, no, no.

18:44.260 --> 18:47.044
I know you guys
are busy.

18:47.046 --> 18:49.630
I really just wanted
to drop off this set

18:49.632 --> 18:52.767
of the working drawings
for the first phase of the housing.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.137
These are
the approved bids.

19:00.393 --> 19:03.311
Figured you'd
want a copy.

19:03.313 --> 19:05.229
I mean, after all
you've done for this.

19:06.733 --> 19:09.617
After all this is forgotten,
those are gonna be there.

19:11.287 --> 19:13.404
I know it's been
a lonely fight.

19:16.626 --> 19:18.376
- Appreciate it.
- Nay.

19:18.378 --> 19:19.877
See ya.

19:31.724 --> 19:34.342
Carmen, sit.
Eat with me.

19:37.063 --> 19:38.479
How are things
in the DR?

19:38.481 --> 19:40.014
What have you heard
from your babies?

19:40.016 --> 19:42.934
Well, a neighbor's dog bit
Maria and it got infected.

19:42.936 --> 19:46.103
Thank God somebody finally saw the bite
and took her for antibiotics.

19:46.105 --> 19:49.240
Oh, and Roberto, he went
to the hospital, too.

19:49.242 --> 19:51.442
He and his friends
were fooling around with an old truck

19:51.444 --> 19:53.527
and thought they'd push it
to get it started.

19:53.529 --> 19:55.613
Ran over his foot.

19:55.615 --> 19:57.698
Boys.

19:57.700 --> 20:00.785
As soon as I get the money
for two plane tickets, they come home.

20:00.787 --> 20:03.004
This is no way to be family.

20:03.006 --> 20:04.205
Ask Paul
for an advance.

20:04.207 --> 20:05.957
You ask him.

20:05.959 --> 20:07.758
Me?
I'm just the wife.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.178
You're his best worker.
Me he can divorce.

20:24.227 --> 20:25.977
<i>Getting out quick, huh?</i>

20:25.979 --> 20:28.813
Yeah, well, Martinelli
let me in early.

20:28.815 --> 20:31.198
I can do the same
for Mayor Spallone.

20:33.569 --> 20:35.369
What is this,
fucking Christmas?

20:35.371 --> 20:38.322
Ah.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.157
You shouldn't have.

20:40.159 --> 20:42.376
What I mean by that is you
really fucking shouldn't have.

20:42.378 --> 20:44.328
Fuck you, DeLuca.
If it's not parked out front

20:44.330 --> 20:46.664
and candy-apple red,
then you really shouldn't have.

20:46.666 --> 20:48.582
First copy
of the charter amendment

20:48.584 --> 20:50.418
you worked up
and we passed.

20:50.420 --> 20:53.838
Because of you, this place won't be half
as fucked up as it is now.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.007
Well, I was just trying
to get rid of you as city manager.

20:56.009 --> 20:58.142
It's easier to eliminate
your job in the charter

20:58.144 --> 20:59.894
than round up
four votes to fire you.

20:59.896 --> 21:02.596
Yeah, four votes are pretty elusive
around here, aren't they?

21:02.598 --> 21:04.649
- Yeah.
- If that had been there for us,

21:04.651 --> 21:06.901
none of this shit with the housing
would have happened.

21:06.903 --> 21:08.819
You had no patronage.

21:08.821 --> 21:10.521
But two years from now?

21:10.523 --> 21:14.775
Nick, even Angelo couldn't get the strong
mayor amendment passed.

21:14.777 --> 21:16.694
It's been a lonely fight,
I know.

21:18.531 --> 21:20.748
- What?
- Pete Smith said the exact same thing.

21:20.750 --> 21:22.450
Lonely fight.

21:24.754 --> 21:26.203
Well, don't be
a stranger, Mr. Mayor.

22:35.241 --> 22:36.690
Girl, where the hell
have you been?

22:36.692 --> 22:38.442
- I've been looking for your ass all night.
- A'ight.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.661
- Your boy locked up.
- What?

22:40.663 --> 22:42.113
John is locked up.

22:42.115 --> 22:44.248
Something about a robbery charge
and some girls in a car.

22:44.250 --> 22:46.033
What the fuck
are you talking about, Meeka?

22:46.035 --> 22:49.370
John is locked up
in Rikers.

22:49.372 --> 22:50.671
That's what Mambo said.

22:50.673 --> 22:52.957
My God, I gotta
go see him.

22:52.959 --> 22:56.293
You realize that's all day
to get there and back, right?

22:56.295 --> 22:58.596
You can't just show up at Rikers.
It's Rikers.

22:58.598 --> 23:01.098
You gotta figure out visiting hours
and when you can see him.

23:01.100 --> 23:02.683
Meeka,
shut the fuck up!

23:02.685 --> 23:05.136
<i>- You shut the fuck up!</i>
- Be stupid.

23:09.192 --> 23:11.308
Nothing at all?
I thought he was your friend.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.656
<i>Kamasa, come here!</i>

23:25.658 --> 23:28.375
<i>- What's up, girl?</i>
<i>- No, come here.</i>

23:28.377 --> 23:30.244
<i>I wanna talk to you</i>
<i>about the deal...</i>

23:38.387 --> 23:40.221
It starts raining.

23:40.223 --> 23:43.474
I tell them, "Yo, we can take the train."
But they didn't want to.

23:43.476 --> 23:45.676
Then like that,
these four girls drive by in a car.

23:45.678 --> 23:49.730
Stash gets them to stop.
They said they might give us a ride.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.521
Do you know them girls?

23:52.634 --> 23:57.643
No, they was just girls, you know?
So we get in their car.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.111
This boy up front
with two girls,

23:59.113 --> 24:00.655
me and Stash in the back
with the other two.

24:00.656 --> 24:03.934
And we was laughing and shit.
So we swapped names and numbers.

24:03.969 --> 24:05.815
You gave them
your name?

24:05.817 --> 24:07.984
Nah, not my real name.
Just Hot.

24:07.986 --> 24:10.654
But I gave
the real number.

24:10.656 --> 24:12.405
I ain't know Stash
and the other boy,

24:12.407 --> 24:14.708
they didn't give
their real numbers.

24:14.710 --> 24:18.578
But later, Stash's friend,
he tries to rob one of them girls

24:18.580 --> 24:21.047
and they're like
all screaming and shit.

24:21.049 --> 24:23.583
I'm like, "What the fuck
was going on here?"

24:23.585 --> 24:27.420
Then they take off
and I got nothing to do but follow.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.222
I thought that
was the end of it,

24:29.224 --> 24:31.508
but one of them
went to the cops.

24:31.510 --> 24:33.093
I guess I'm the only one
they could find

24:33.095 --> 24:34.978
'cause I'm the only one
that gave a real number.

24:34.980 --> 24:37.397
Now, shit, they got me
on robbery two.

24:40.235 --> 24:42.352
Why you gave them
your number?

24:47.359 --> 24:50.443
They're clearing the land for the
housing and what are you doing?

24:50.445 --> 24:52.028
<i>- What can I do?</i>
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

24:52.030 --> 24:53.747
<i>You tell them</i>
<i>we're not gonna take it.</i>

24:53.749 --> 24:55.832
- Stop the Housing Authority
from making a plan. - Mr. Spallone.

24:55.834 --> 24:58.451
All right, all right.
You think I should just lie down

24:58.453 --> 25:00.036
in front of a bulldozer?
Come on, Mary.

25:00.038 --> 25:03.039
Well, how is this any different from when
Nick Wasicsko was mayor?

25:03.041 --> 25:05.292
I'll tell you.
That kid was all wet.

25:05.294 --> 25:07.627
He ran saying he would fight
and then he didn't fight.

25:07.629 --> 25:09.212
And you're the same
way now, Hank.

25:09.214 --> 25:10.797
Come on, you know where I stand.

25:10.799 --> 25:12.299
But what can I do
if the court won't hear it?

25:12.301 --> 25:15.018
Mr. Mayor, if you please.
We'd like to start the meeting now.

25:15.020 --> 25:17.721
- All right.
- If we start late, we end later.

25:17.723 --> 25:20.307
Hold your horses.
Come on, now.

25:20.309 --> 25:21.891
You know me.
You know me.

25:21.893 --> 25:23.860
Come on.

25:26.898 --> 25:28.565
Yeah, give me the hammer.

25:30.736 --> 25:32.819
What's first?

25:32.821 --> 25:36.122
Call to order, then the pledge,
then the proclamations.

25:36.124 --> 25:38.575
Oh, Christ, wake me
when there's something that matters.

25:44.166 --> 25:46.916
Council meeting of the
City of Yonkers is now in session.

25:46.918 --> 25:49.302
Please all rise
for the Pledge of Allegiance.

26:37.969 --> 26:39.803
Hmm.

26:53.318 --> 26:54.868

28:58.276 --> 29:00.443
Can you imagine
either of us

29:00.445 --> 29:02.996
being afraid to go
to a client any-damn-where?

29:02.998 --> 29:05.114
I mean, really.

29:05.116 --> 29:07.283
I don't understand.

29:07.285 --> 29:09.202
Maybe it's because
I've been living there

29:09.204 --> 29:12.622
so long, I don't
see it anymore.

29:12.624 --> 29:17.177
But nobody's gonna mess with a
home nurse coming to see a client.

29:17.179 --> 29:19.963
Even the hoodlums
know why you're there.

29:19.965 --> 29:23.516
If you could move, would you?

29:23.518 --> 29:26.519
My home is my home.

29:26.521 --> 29:29.055
'Cause those
new houses, Norma,

29:29.057 --> 29:31.891
the ones the city's been fighting about,
they're coming.

29:31.893 --> 29:34.027
Not to this neighborhood
they ain't.

29:34.029 --> 29:36.646
That's the point.
They're all gonna be over to the east.

29:36.648 --> 29:39.199
- Amongst the white folk.
- So?

29:39.201 --> 29:42.202
So, Pat, honey,

29:42.204 --> 29:45.205
you would want to live
where people were angry at you?

29:45.207 --> 29:48.825
This isn't about them.
It's you I'm talking about.

29:50.662 --> 29:52.829
Reverend George
gonna do a march

29:52.831 --> 29:57.333
going from Messiah Baptist over to
the housing site over by the raceway.

29:57.335 --> 30:00.420
I don't know nothing
about that.

30:00.422 --> 30:03.223
This Saturday.
I'm going for sure.

30:03.225 --> 30:05.508
Now why would you
want to do that?

30:07.012 --> 30:09.762
How come the only people

30:09.764 --> 30:12.348
talking about this
damn housing thing are white?

30:12.350 --> 30:16.519
How come the only faces
you see on television about this are white?

30:16.521 --> 30:18.905
They don't want us
living over there.

30:18.907 --> 30:20.156
But they don't know us.

30:20.158 --> 30:21.741
Ain't never even
seen us before.

30:21.743 --> 30:24.527
And whose fault is that?

30:24.529 --> 30:28.364
Marching around the East Side
is just gonna make it worse.

30:28.366 --> 30:31.284
Well, like you said,
back in the day,

30:31.286 --> 30:34.003
we weren't scared to go
anyplace we needed to go.

30:34.005 --> 30:36.005
And I ain't
gonna scare now.

30:36.007 --> 30:38.041
- What about you?
- Me?

30:41.212 --> 30:43.796
I like being
with my own.

31:06.738 --> 31:09.038
You writing again?

31:09.040 --> 31:11.708
I wouldn't do that shit
for nobody.

31:11.710 --> 31:13.826
Well, he writes me
every day.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.461
Mm-hmm.

31:17.415 --> 31:19.248
Public defender wants
him to take a deal.

31:19.250 --> 31:20.667
Oh, yeah?

31:20.669 --> 31:22.502
Says if he takes a plea
to second degree robbery,

31:22.504 --> 31:24.587
he'll be out
in September, maybe.

31:24.589 --> 31:26.422
Well, that won't be too long at all.

31:28.727 --> 31:30.476
The baby
will be born by then.

31:34.182 --> 31:36.316
Be nice coming home,
I suppose.

31:40.071 --> 31:44.440
<i>♪ so you think my heart</i>
<i>is made of stone...</i>

32:01.793 --> 32:04.460
I really don't know
what to do next.

32:04.462 --> 32:07.013
Hang my shingle?

32:07.015 --> 32:10.383
Take some cases?
Maybe teach?

32:10.385 --> 32:13.469
Oh, it's hard.

32:13.471 --> 32:15.104
You know?

32:15.106 --> 32:16.689
As miserable as they
can make it for you

32:16.691 --> 32:18.224
when you're in
the middle of things,

32:18.226 --> 32:20.226
at least you're in
the middle of things, you know?

32:21.980 --> 32:24.364
And the thing is,
when you lose,

32:24.366 --> 32:26.983
people will say,
"Oh, it's nothing personal, you know?

32:26.985 --> 32:29.035
It was just that issue
or this thing that happened."

32:29.037 --> 32:31.704
But you know what? People either vote
for you or they vote for the other guy.

32:33.992 --> 32:35.825
What's more personal
than that?

32:39.881 --> 32:41.998
Anyway, I'm all right.
I'll figure it out.

32:43.968 --> 32:45.718
Don't worry about me.

32:51.643 --> 32:53.309
See you later, Pop.

33:13.698 --> 33:16.532
We're gonna put
you down for a nap, little man.

33:16.534 --> 33:19.585
Don't you worry,
we're gonna put you down for a nap.

33:19.587 --> 33:21.003
Don't you worry.

33:25.043 --> 33:26.626
<i>Don't you worry.</i>

33:34.636 --> 33:37.720
<i>- Fuck!</i>
<i>- Chill. Chill, nigga. Shit!</i>

33:42.727 --> 33:44.977
He's just
overtired is all.

33:55.707 --> 33:57.039
I want to thank you
for helping me

33:57.041 --> 34:00.376
with the groceries
this month, Daddy.

34:00.378 --> 34:03.079
When that man got my purse
at the Palisades bus stop,

34:03.081 --> 34:04.997
he took my whole check.

34:04.999 --> 34:06.916
I had just cashed out.

34:25.186 --> 34:26.985
Those damn things.

34:29.357 --> 34:32.190
They're all over the building
from the damn junkies.

34:32.193 --> 34:34.827
In the hallway,
in the elevator.

34:36.781 --> 34:38.781
You're always
kicking them.

34:38.783 --> 34:41.117
Tracking them in
when you walk.

34:49.344 --> 34:51.210
Tell the little man
I said good-bye.

35:03.808 --> 35:05.441
Your mother and me...

35:10.648 --> 35:12.315
we're here
when you need us.

35:56.527 --> 35:58.244
Hey, come back.

35:59.414 --> 36:01.497
Why do you keep
turning around?

36:01.499 --> 36:03.032
I'm not.

36:03.034 --> 36:05.368
Come on.
You're so bad at this.

36:05.370 --> 36:08.337
I'm a guy and I'm better
at the cuddle than you are.

36:08.339 --> 36:11.540
You're a disgrace
to your gender.

36:11.542 --> 36:14.176
Nick, I gotta be
at work tomorrow.

36:16.965 --> 36:19.715
Come here.

36:19.717 --> 36:21.133
Hey.

36:21.135 --> 36:24.303
What's the matter?

36:24.305 --> 36:27.356
Nothing.
I just-- I love you.

36:27.358 --> 36:28.891
You know that?

36:28.893 --> 36:31.227
Yeah, I love you, too.

36:32.730 --> 36:34.981
I couldn't function
without you.

36:34.983 --> 36:36.782
Oh.

36:36.784 --> 36:38.901
You keep me grounded.

36:40.321 --> 36:42.655
- You keep me organized.
- I keep you organized?

36:42.657 --> 36:45.574
Yeah, like, you're grounded.
You know what I mean?

36:45.576 --> 36:48.577
You're a stabilizing
influence.

36:50.581 --> 36:52.581
And you smell nice, too.

36:54.585 --> 36:58.137
And you also make
a really good BLT sandwich.

36:58.139 --> 37:01.974
Not too much mayo and
the bacon is just so crisp.

37:01.976 --> 37:05.094
Aren't you
the romantic one?

37:15.156 --> 37:16.656
Will you marry me?

37:18.109 --> 37:19.659
Hmm?

37:22.113 --> 37:25.031
I was thinking maybe
in May in the spring.

37:27.669 --> 37:30.202
- Nay, you're the only one--
- Shut up.

37:30.204 --> 37:31.837
Of course
I'll marry you.

37:37.378 --> 37:39.178
We're going
to sleep now, okay?

37:47.188 --> 37:49.188
I don't think so.

37:51.476 --> 37:53.609
I don't think so.

38:02.453 --> 38:04.620
I don't think so.

38:04.622 --> 38:07.289
Stop.

take this one.

39:03.381 --> 39:05.014
You have
a beautiful family.

39:05.016 --> 39:06.632
- Come on.
<i>- All right. Okay.</i>

39:06.634 --> 39:08.717
Let's all go over there.

39:08.719 --> 39:10.970
- Welcome to New York.
- Thank you.

39:10.972 --> 39:14.273
<i>No peace, no justice.</i>

39:14.275 --> 39:16.725
No peace, no justice.

39:16.727 --> 39:18.727
No peace, no justice.

39:18.729 --> 39:21.030
No peace,
no justice.

39:21.032 --> 39:23.449
<i>No peace, no justice.</i>

39:23.451 --> 39:25.951
<i>No peace,</i>
<i>no justice.</i>

39:25.953 --> 39:28.070
No peace, no justice.

39:28.072 --> 39:30.456
No peace,
no justice.

39:30.458 --> 39:32.741
No peace, no justice.

39:32.743 --> 39:34.577
No peace,
no justice.

39:34.579 --> 39:36.579
You know
who's leading them?

39:36.581 --> 39:39.582
Al Sharpton.
The Tawana Brawley guy.

39:39.584 --> 39:41.667
Now we got that asshole
to deal with.

39:41.669 --> 39:43.419
Hi.

39:46.140 --> 39:48.224
I'm Pat.
I'm Pat Williams.

39:48.226 --> 39:51.343
- Pat.
- Nice to meet you.

39:51.345 --> 39:53.762
No peace, no justice.

39:53.764 --> 39:56.065
No peace,
no justice.

39:56.067 --> 39:58.267
No peace, no justice.

39:58.269 --> 40:00.769
No peace,
no justice.

40:00.771 --> 40:02.938
<i>No peace, no justice.</i>

40:02.940 --> 40:04.940
<i>No peace, no...</i>

40:04.942 --> 40:06.242
<i>...Reverend
Sharpton was joined</i>

40:06.244 --> 40:08.027
<i>by New York activist</i>
<i>Alton Maddox</i>

40:08.029 --> 40:10.830
<i>as well as Yonkers' own</i>
<i>Reverend Darryl George</i>

40:10.832 --> 40:13.916
<i>to lead the protest against</i>
<i>Mayor Henry Spallone's opposition</i>

40:13.918 --> 40:16.619
<i>to thwart ordered</i>
<i>housing desegregation.</i>

40:16.621 --> 40:19.455
<i>The three led a crowd of
nearly 400 chanting protestors</i>

40:19.457 --> 40:21.790
<i>on a three-and-a-half-mile</i>
<i>march towards Yonkers.</i>

40:21.792 --> 40:23.425
<i>We're moving in!</i>

40:23.427 --> 40:25.544
<i>The group marched
from Messiah Baptist Church...</i>

40:50.338 --> 40:52.621
<i>About 100 police
officers in riot gear</i>

40:52.623 --> 40:54.206
<i>lined</i>
<i>the marchers around,</i>

40:54.208 --> 40:57.710
<i>but no trouble was reported</i>
<i>and no arrests were made.</i>

40:57.712 --> 40:59.178
<i>The marchers said</i>
<i>they were protesting</i>

40:59.180 --> 41:02.298
<i>Mayor Spallone and other
councilmen drinking champagne</i>

41:02.300 --> 41:04.300
<i>to celebrate</i>
<i>their January 10th victory...</i>

41:10.808 --> 41:12.942
Thank you.
Thank you.

41:12.944 --> 41:14.477
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

41:14.479 --> 41:16.979
Thank you very much.
I'm here tonight to announce

41:16.981 --> 41:19.448
I'm running for reelection
as mayor of Yonkers.

41:22.487 --> 41:24.820
I'm coming out.

41:24.822 --> 41:27.823
I'm running.

41:27.825 --> 41:29.742
And those who think
I'm a dead turkey,

41:29.744 --> 41:31.877
come on, bring it on.

41:31.879 --> 41:33.496
<i>Go, Hank!</i>

41:33.498 --> 41:36.082
I'm gonna be
campaigning tonight,

41:36.084 --> 41:38.384
tomorrow,
and the day after

41:38.386 --> 41:40.469
and every day until
next year's election.

41:41.973 --> 41:44.673
Jesus, 14 months out,

41:44.675 --> 41:46.926
he's already announcing.

41:46.928 --> 41:48.978
He's running
scared already.

41:48.980 --> 41:51.680
At City Hall they're saying
he did it early to scare off competition.

41:51.682 --> 41:54.016
Well, yeah, he heard that Martinelli
was running again.

41:54.018 --> 41:57.353
There'll be a dozen or so
others lining up before it's all over.

41:57.355 --> 42:00.656
But this shit?
This makes Spallone look desperate.

42:00.658 --> 42:02.992
Desperate's no way
to kick off a campaign.

42:04.328 --> 42:05.995
<i>Spallone sold us out...</i>

42:05.997 --> 42:08.364
Check it out.
Jack O'Toole.

42:08.366 --> 42:11.000
He's finished.
We believed in him,

42:11.002 --> 42:13.619
we backed him and
his campaign last year,

42:13.621 --> 42:15.538
but he has been
a complete disappointment.

42:15.540 --> 42:18.958
He said he'd never give up.
He said he'd never give in to the judge.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.876
That's it.
That's it.

42:20.878 --> 42:23.095
Spallone lost O'Toole.
Stick a fork in him.

42:23.097 --> 42:25.131
He's done.
That's his base right there.

42:25.133 --> 42:28.517
O'Toole scares me.
Like, more than the others.

42:28.519 --> 42:31.020
Yeah, 'cause he's
more dangerous.

42:31.022 --> 42:34.390
You will never hear Jack O'Toole
utter a racist phrase

42:34.392 --> 42:37.726
'cause guys like that,
they learn how not to say the bad words.

42:37.728 --> 42:40.396
No more coon.
No more nigger.

42:40.398 --> 42:43.482
Nothing out of his mouth
that'll give it away, you know?

42:43.484 --> 42:45.734
It's all property values
and life and liberty

42:45.736 --> 42:48.871
and people only living
where they can afford and all that talk.

42:48.873 --> 42:51.407
But underneath it all,
it's fear.

42:51.409 --> 42:53.159
Same as it ever was.

42:54.745 --> 42:56.912
I played into
that fear, too.

42:56.914 --> 42:59.415
When I got in
for mayor, I did.

42:59.417 --> 43:01.133
It chewed me up.

43:05.256 --> 43:08.090
Man.

43:08.092 --> 43:11.260
What I would do with a
second chance at that brass ring.

43:13.014 --> 43:15.097
They're getting ready
to knock School Four down.

43:16.934 --> 43:18.434
This beautiful
old building.

43:18.436 --> 43:21.403
I mean,
it's 104 years old.

43:21.405 --> 43:24.440
It's a sin to tear
this down, Buddy.

43:24.442 --> 43:27.026
Yeah.

43:27.028 --> 43:30.079
Well, do you think there'll be
any trouble when they start?

43:30.081 --> 43:33.115
They did some demolition over
at the site by the raceway,

43:33.117 --> 43:34.450
but that was just
a vacant garage.

43:34.452 --> 43:36.418
I mean, when people
see this go down...

43:36.420 --> 43:38.587
Is Jack O'Toole
planning anything?

43:38.589 --> 43:40.339
<i>He says we should</i>
<i>be at every site,</i>

43:40.341 --> 43:41.790
protest every
single change.

43:44.095 --> 43:46.962
- I'm late.
- I'll see you later.

43:46.964 --> 43:48.631
Bye.

43:48.633 --> 43:50.966
Take care, doll.
All right.

43:52.687 --> 43:54.603
I think I'm gonna
drive out there, okay?

43:54.605 --> 43:57.806
I think I feel like
I need to see it for myself.

43:57.808 --> 43:59.808
Okay.
Well, be safe.

44:01.395 --> 44:03.696
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you.

44:59.133 --> 45:02.041
_

45:31.235 --> 45:33.035
Oh, boy.

46:56.537 --> 46:59.621
Man, yo.

47:05.046 --> 47:06.995
Oh, my God. Your cheek.
You cut?

47:06.997 --> 47:08.831
Ain't nothing.

47:13.337 --> 47:14.887
What we got here?

47:14.889 --> 47:16.972
This is John
Billie Santos.

47:21.929 --> 47:24.012
Look at that.

47:31.522 --> 47:33.572
I don't know.

47:33.574 --> 47:36.525
It's a hard thing giving
someone else your name.

47:36.527 --> 47:38.694
Well, he has
both our names.

47:38.696 --> 47:40.913
That's right.

47:40.915 --> 47:43.665
I'm on the wait list for Schlobohm
for a place of our own.

47:43.667 --> 47:45.167
The housing lady
say with the baby

47:45.169 --> 47:46.835
I go to the top
of the list.

47:46.837 --> 47:48.203
- Yeah?
- Just about.

47:51.041 --> 47:52.458
Come here.

48:01.018 --> 48:03.685
Hey.
Oh, hey, Anne.

48:03.687 --> 48:04.887
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:16.901 --> 48:20.235
Okay, why are you
smiling like cats?

48:20.237 --> 48:21.820
Um, I don't know.
Maybe it's this

48:21.822 --> 48:23.789
John F. Kennedy Profile
in Courage Award.

48:23.791 --> 48:25.207
What?

48:29.380 --> 48:32.581
- I'm a finalist. I haven't--
- Shh!

48:32.583 --> 48:33.966
I think Moynihan
must have nominated me.

48:33.968 --> 48:37.002
Shh!

48:40.257 --> 48:43.008
All right, while--
while only 28 years old,

48:43.010 --> 48:46.011
you demonstrated political
courage by your leadership

48:46.013 --> 48:50.265
and your unrelenting support for the rights
of minorities and the poor.

48:50.267 --> 48:53.852
Despite calls for your resignation
and threats to your personal safety,

48:53.854 --> 48:56.155
you forged a path
to equality of opportunity

48:56.157 --> 49:00.275
and access to public housing in all
parts of Yonkers, the committee found.

49:00.277 --> 49:02.361
It comes with
a $25,000 check if I win.

49:03.948 --> 49:07.166
Jackie Onassis herself
handed out the award last year.

49:07.168 --> 49:09.284
If I'm gonna meet
Jackie Kennedy,

49:09.286 --> 49:10.586
I gotta go shopping.

49:10.588 --> 49:12.454
Okay, Mom.

49:15.626 --> 49:17.543
You deserve this
so much.

49:17.545 --> 49:20.045
If I win this,
I'm running for mayor again.

49:20.047 --> 49:21.547
- Yeah.
- No question.

49:21.549 --> 49:22.931
No question.

49:26.020 --> 49:27.469
Look at this.
Look.

49:27.471 --> 49:29.555
<i>Yellow.</i>

49:34.695 --> 49:36.645
<i>Got that yellow.</i>

49:39.950 --> 49:41.984
How you doing
this evening?

49:41.986 --> 49:44.870
I'm all right.
You up again?

49:44.872 --> 49:46.321
<i>Got them yellow tops.</i>

49:46.323 --> 49:50.209
Yeah, but I'm a little
short right now.

49:50.211 --> 49:52.961
I mean, I'll be good
later in the week, but now...

49:55.299 --> 49:58.500
- I think we can work something out.
<i>- Yellow.</i>

49:58.502 --> 50:00.335
Cool.

50:00.337 --> 50:03.005
I'll get right with you
later this week, for sure.

50:03.007 --> 50:06.508
Nah, I mean work it out.

50:06.510 --> 50:09.811
You know, a little
something something.

50:09.813 --> 50:11.930
<i>Yellow tops here.</i>

50:11.932 --> 50:13.982
- I don't--
- Come on, girl, you ain't want the rock?

50:13.984 --> 50:15.183
What's up?

50:15.185 --> 50:16.652
I'll get you money
later this week.

50:16.654 --> 50:19.354
There ain't no later.
Ain't no free.

50:19.356 --> 50:22.024
You and me just got
to step around the corner.

50:22.026 --> 50:23.358
<i>Yellow.</i>

50:29.033 --> 50:31.033
<i>- Jimmy D!</i>
<i>- Yo.</i>

50:31.035 --> 50:32.417
<i>- Yo, get your ass over here.</i>
<i>- Yellow.</i>

50:32.419 --> 50:34.620
<i>Come on, man,
what you want now?</i>

50:34.622 --> 50:37.422
<i>- Got that yellow.</i>
<i>- What's up, man?</i>

50:43.047 --> 50:45.847
<i>No rest till we've won.</i>

50:45.849 --> 50:47.883

No rest

50:54.141 --> 50:56.224
No rest

50:56.226 --> 50:58.226
No rest till
we've won.

50:58.228 --> 51:00.445
No rest

51:00.447 --> 51:02.397
No rest till

51:02.399 --> 51:04.399
No rest

51:04.401 --> 51:06.485
No rest till

No rest

51:16.830 --> 51:18.964
No rest till

51:18.966 --> 51:21.133
- No rest till we've won.
- Jack!

51:21.135 --> 51:25.220
- No rest till we've won.
No rest till we've won. - Jack O'Toole!

51:25.222 --> 51:27.506
- No rest--
- What are we doing here?

51:27.508 --> 51:30.926
They started
building already.

51:30.928 --> 51:33.729
We're letting them know
that this doesn't end.

51:33.731 --> 51:35.814
They're never gonna
be welcome here.

51:35.816 --> 51:37.516
What are we trying
to accomplish?

51:37.518 --> 51:39.651
No rights for the whites!

51:39.653 --> 51:41.269
- What?
<i>- We'll remember in November.</i>

51:41.271 --> 51:43.772
We'll remember in November.

51:43.774 --> 51:45.524
We'll remember
in November.

51:45.526 --> 51:47.993
We'll remember in November.

51:56.120 --> 51:58.120
<i>All sewage is
done at the plant.</i>

51:58.122 --> 52:00.539
<i>The whole kit and caboodle will be
done by the time they truck down here.</i>

52:00.541 --> 52:02.507
You'll have
this done in one day?

52:02.509 --> 52:05.510
Oh, yeah. We'll weld them in
place, hook up the utilities,

52:05.512 --> 52:06.878
and then
we're good to go.

52:06.880 --> 52:08.847
How quickly
can you set the rest?

52:08.849 --> 52:11.967
Oh, after this,
we'll be setting two or three a day.

52:11.969 --> 52:15.137
We'll have the first 142 up
by the end of the year. No problem.
