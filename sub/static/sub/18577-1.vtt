00:45.319 --> 00:46.886
Get up, get up.

00:46.987 --> 00:49.720
- Fucking fight, huh?!
- Damn!

00:59.866 --> 01:02.933
Yeah! Yeah! Come on!

01:18.584 --> 01:21.052
I guess I'll try number three!

01:37.303 --> 01:39.203
Watch it, get him!

02:24.483 --> 02:26.951
Let go! Let go!

02:31.524 --> 02:33.457
Our winner!

02:37.464 --> 02:39.365
- You got that?
- Not of all if it, I...

02:39.466 --> 02:42.034
Okay. I'm going to collect our money.

02:42.135 --> 02:43.669
I'll give you 10% tomorrow.

02:43.770 --> 02:45.638
Don't even worry about that Champ.

02:45.739 --> 02:47.707
You need the money
and you are good for it,

02:47.808 --> 02:51.143
I trust you. Besides, I made
like, an extra 40 on the fight.

02:51.244 --> 02:52.845
I told you to stop betting.

02:52.946 --> 02:55.014
I know, look, just go
get your money, okay?

02:55.115 --> 02:58.751
Yeah, sure. Say hi
to Maria for me, okay?

02:58.852 --> 03:02.186
Shit! She's gonna kill me.

03:12.431 --> 03:14.634
Great fight, Champ! Great fight tonight!

03:14.735 --> 03:16.569
- Thank you, Tony.
- I want to talk.

03:16.670 --> 03:19.005
I gotta few ideas,

03:19.106 --> 03:21.741
- some things coming up...
- You got my money?

03:21.842 --> 03:24.076
Oh, yeah, yeah. Right here.

03:24.177 --> 03:26.412
You know I was thinking that kid, uh,

03:26.513 --> 03:28.681
that Black Scorpion out of Compton.

03:28.782 --> 03:32.184
He's a little vicious bastard
but I think you could take his ass.

03:32.285 --> 03:35.688
Why don't we set that up for next week?

03:35.789 --> 03:39.292
You're short, Tony.
You're short 40 bucks.

03:39.393 --> 03:43.029
Yeah I know. I had some, uh,
some unexpected expenses

03:43.130 --> 03:45.064
this week. But I'll tell you what,

03:45.165 --> 03:47.300
I'm going to make it up to you, alright?

03:47.401 --> 03:52.638
Tony, I was really coming
about money, man. I need those 40.

03:52.739 --> 03:56.342
I'll tell you what, kid.
I'm gonna add an additional 20

03:56.443 --> 04:00.311
onto next week, huh? After the fight.

04:00.479 --> 04:02.949
How's that sound?

04:03.050 --> 04:07.318
- Tony... Yeah, yeah okay.
- Huh? Let's go have a drink.

04:15.895 --> 04:17.930
What are you drinking?

04:18.031 --> 04:22.266
- Ice. Get me ice, a lot of ice.
- Ice?!

04:23.235 --> 04:27.471
- You gonna drink ice?
- Get me a diet coke, whatever.

04:30.476 --> 04:33.377
Why don't you have a real drink?

04:33.679 --> 04:34.947
Thank you, Tony.

04:44.924 --> 04:46.525
<i>Champ Cage the Destroyer Fury</i>

04:46.626 --> 04:48.527
<i>knocked out his opponent in 3 seconds,</i>

04:48.628 --> 04:51.998
<i>which became the new fasted time
in MMA history.</i>

04:52.099 --> 04:55.201
<i>The UXC is running out
of opponents for the Champ</i>

04:55.302 --> 04:58.337
<i>and the president, John Stone,
is looking for challengers.</i>

04:58.438 --> 05:03.307
Cage Fury, man. World MMA Champion.

05:03.476 --> 05:05.177
It's my dream to fight with him.

05:05.278 --> 05:09.715
Dream? Should be more
like your nightmare.

05:09.816 --> 05:12.149
Let's drink to that.

05:21.627 --> 05:24.196
Hey, pretty boy.

05:24.297 --> 05:26.599
- Nice fight tonight.
- Thanks.

05:26.700 --> 05:31.368
My boy here, Little Juan,
says you fight like his abuelita.

05:33.539 --> 05:38.477
You know, he's probably right.
You guys have a great night, ok?

05:39.506 --> 05:44.982
Not now. I like him.
He reminds me of my little pit-bull.

06:08.974 --> 06:12.476
- How are you guys doing?
- We're okay.

06:13.012 --> 06:15.379
How'd you do?

06:16.982 --> 06:19.249
Not too good.

06:27.726 --> 06:30.294
Oh, thank God.

06:30.863 --> 06:32.264
Thank God is right.

06:32.365 --> 06:35.101
Okay, so we can pay the electricity bill

06:35.202 --> 06:37.470
tomorrow and the water next week.

06:37.571 --> 06:41.739
You worry too much.
I got it all taken care of.

06:47.346 --> 06:50.547
He's good, he's strong, Hector.

06:52.651 --> 06:56.253
- Go to bed, I'll met you there.
- Okay.

07:10.703 --> 07:13.170
How are you doing, buddy?

07:27.186 --> 07:31.155
- How was your day, baby?
- It was okay.

07:33.126 --> 07:36.060
Look at your face.

07:36.395 --> 07:39.899
Yeah, I'm getting prettier
by the minute.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.001
How did you win?

07:42.102 --> 07:45.202
I got this guy in a triangle, you know.

07:45.938 --> 07:50.407
When I got him where I need,
I squeezed with all my might.

07:50.809 --> 07:52.411
It was a good fight.

07:52.512 --> 07:55.414
Hector, I know that you love this

07:55.515 --> 07:57.750
and I've never seen you so happy, but...

07:57.851 --> 07:59.351
But I need to get a real job.

07:59.452 --> 08:01.921
Don't worry, I got a few
interviews tomorrow.

08:02.022 --> 08:06.390
- I'll get something.
- I know you're trying, baby.

08:11.733 --> 08:15.799
It's just that...
You know, when I'm fighting...

08:16.135 --> 08:18.368
when I'm in there...

08:19.405 --> 08:22.339
just for a moment, you know...

08:24.009 --> 08:26.343
I feel like I'm a winner.

08:28.180 --> 08:31.181
I feel like I'm somebody, you know.

08:34.253 --> 08:37.888
I can take all my pain
and all my anger out.

08:41.460 --> 08:44.428
And right after they raise my hand,

08:45.597 --> 08:48.899
you and Martin immediately
come to my mind.

08:50.903 --> 08:54.905
And I realize right there
how much I love you both.

08:57.976 --> 08:59.979
Baby?

09:00.080 --> 09:03.780
Goodnight, I love you too.

09:05.017 --> 09:07.251
Goodnight, baby.

09:11.123 --> 09:13.191
Maria!

09:13.292 --> 09:14.693
What's happening, baby?

09:14.794 --> 09:17.062
I can't figure out
how to load this thing.

09:17.163 --> 09:18.564
I'm going crazy.

09:18.665 --> 09:20.399
I told you, you have to treat it
like a baby.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.601
Gently and with a lot of love.

09:25.138 --> 09:29.773
That special nurse's touch
only you seem to posses.

09:34.179 --> 09:36.914
Alright, let's see what we got here.

09:39.985 --> 09:42.586
Holy shit!

10:26.632 --> 10:29.301
This is the guy I was telling you about,

10:29.402 --> 10:31.203
he's a superstar in the web

10:31.304 --> 10:34.838
and he's actually a better
than okay fighter.

10:36.575 --> 10:38.610
The Mexican Chavez?

10:38.711 --> 10:40.746
You know, you might be a genius.

10:40.847 --> 10:43.349
He's exactly what we are looking for.

10:43.450 --> 10:46.118
The Latinos represent 50%
of our pay per view sales.

10:46.219 --> 10:48.487
I told you I'd find somebody.

10:48.588 --> 10:50.856
I can see it now; he's Mexico,

10:50.957 --> 10:53.559
he's America, he's today, he's tomorrow.

10:53.660 --> 10:56.662
Not just somebody, but a dream.

10:56.763 --> 10:59.763
We can do the fight on Cinco de Mayo.

11:01.366 --> 11:05.771
I never doubt you, but that's
three weeks away, I mean...

11:05.872 --> 11:08.307
- He might not even be in shape.
- Listen.

11:08.408 --> 11:11.577
The late choice will build
the drama even higher.

11:11.678 --> 11:15.748
Come on guys, I don't have all day.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.583
I didn't come here to see this show.

11:17.684 --> 11:20.419
Look, this is the perfect fight
for your boy.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.422
You get a great commission,
three weeks away,

11:23.523 --> 11:27.626
- Mexican Independence Day.
- Take a look.

11:27.727 --> 11:30.929
Brent, would you put
some salve on my tattoo?

11:31.030 --> 11:33.797
It eases the inflammation.

11:34.933 --> 11:36.468
This guy's an amateur.

11:36.569 --> 11:38.804
That's exactly why
he's the perfect challenger.

11:38.905 --> 11:40.906
He's Hispanic so we make a lot of money,

11:41.007 --> 11:43.675
and your boy cruises
to another easy fight.

11:43.776 --> 11:46.111
- I don't know.
- It's the finest fuel

11:46.212 --> 11:49.348
to feed the flame of the myth

11:49.449 --> 11:52.949
of Cage the Destroyer Fury.

12:47.472 --> 12:49.673
Hey, fighter.

12:50.008 --> 12:53.579
Whoa, what happened to your face?

12:53.680 --> 12:56.715
- Your wife hit me.
- Oh, come on.

12:56.816 --> 12:59.750
How's my little brother doing?

13:00.352 --> 13:02.721
I'm not your little brother anymore.

13:02.822 --> 13:06.692
I'm 42, I have a wife and a kid.

13:06.793 --> 13:08.760
You're still my little brother.

13:08.861 --> 13:12.231
I want to know why
you haven't come to church?

13:12.332 --> 13:13.932
Isn't it enough Jesus has got you.

13:14.033 --> 13:16.535
Can't you just pray for the two of us?

13:16.636 --> 13:20.937
No. It doesn't work that way.

13:21.506 --> 13:23.840
Well, too bad brother.

13:24.376 --> 13:26.211
That's why you asked me to come here?

13:26.312 --> 13:28.512
What do you need?

13:28.614 --> 13:30.847
Why am I here?

13:33.385 --> 13:35.254
I need one of your blessings, ok?

13:35.355 --> 13:38.857
I have a few job interviews
and I need all the help I can get.

13:38.958 --> 13:41.558
- Jobs?
- Yeah.

13:41.927 --> 13:45.162
You know you always have my blessing.

13:45.864 --> 13:48.632
But I want to see you on Sunday.

13:49.167 --> 13:54.037
- I'll try.
- Try.

13:54.373 --> 13:56.807
Well, I'll do my best.

13:58.744 --> 14:02.447
That's good enough.
How's my nephew, Martin?

14:02.548 --> 14:04.683
He's doing good, he's good.

14:04.784 --> 14:06.485
Look, I got to get going.

14:06.586 --> 14:10.422
Okay, okay, okay.
Don't stop because of me.

14:10.523 --> 14:13.723
Hey, hey! What about the blessing?

14:15.494 --> 14:17.594
Okay.

14:21.800 --> 14:25.969
You're good to go.
I want to see you on Sunday.

14:28.473 --> 14:30.974
Or else I'm going to hurt you!

14:32.511 --> 14:34.646
What's that word there?

14:34.747 --> 14:37.282
- Start?
- Start, that's good.

14:37.383 --> 14:39.916
Keep going.

14:45.306 --> 14:47.190
Hang on, baby.

14:50.862 --> 14:52.829
Hello?

14:53.732 --> 14:56.166
Yeah, this is she.

14:58.871 --> 15:01.506
Actually we're gonna be making
that payment today,

15:01.607 --> 15:05.008
and thank you for not
disconnecting it sooner.

15:07.779 --> 15:11.815
Yes, that's correct, and when
is our next payment due?

15:14.786 --> 15:17.521
Yeah, but I'm paying you today.

15:21.126 --> 15:23.895
Listen, my husband and I
have been out of work

15:23.996 --> 15:26.898
the last ten months and we've been
going on every interview

15:26.999 --> 15:30.202
that we could get.
If you could please, maybe

15:30.303 --> 15:34.204
push the payment back
by two weeks or so, yeah?

15:37.042 --> 15:40.644
Well, could I talk to your supervisor?

15:43.348 --> 15:46.116
Okay, thanks I will.

16:22.288 --> 16:26.158
Excuse me, Dr. Baker, I am Chavez...

16:26.259 --> 16:28.625
Hi Mr. Chavez.

16:29.194 --> 16:31.630
Well sadly, I don't have
good news for you.

16:31.731 --> 16:33.699
Martin will need another operation.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.468
The surgery we performed
when he was 4 months old

16:36.569 --> 16:39.037
to widen the narrowing
preliminary tracked

16:39.138 --> 16:42.674
to enclose the ventricular
septal defect,

16:42.775 --> 16:46.111
wasn't as successful as we had hoped.

16:46.212 --> 16:49.347
Plainly, his heart is weakening.

16:49.448 --> 16:52.684
He's going to need
another surgery very soon.

16:52.785 --> 16:58.088
Okay. Thank you.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.074
Hey, baby.

17:18.643 --> 17:20.078
I have to go to an interview.

17:20.179 --> 17:23.080
- I'll be right back, ok?
- Okay.

17:23.182 --> 17:25.349
- I love you.
- Miss you already.

17:25.451 --> 17:27.916
Get better.

17:44.336 --> 17:46.104
Hi, I'm Gia Chavez.

17:46.205 --> 17:50.373
Oh, yes, Mr. White is ready
for you right now.

17:50.775 --> 17:52.976
Thank you.

17:54.012 --> 17:57.916
So in the very first round,
he kicked me right here

17:58.017 --> 18:01.853
and cut this muscle off in half.

18:01.954 --> 18:05.857
I was in so much pain.
And I went through it, you know.

18:05.958 --> 18:08.493
In round first, second, third,
but in the fourth round

18:08.594 --> 18:12.931
when I go to the corner,
your Uncle Jose was there.

18:13.032 --> 18:14.566
I was ready to tell him, "Man,

18:14.667 --> 18:16.301
I throw the towel, it's too much pain,

18:16.402 --> 18:19.302
I can't take it, it's not worth it."

18:19.704 --> 18:21.573
And right before I'm going to say it,

18:21.674 --> 18:26.843
he looks at me and says
"You got this man, I love you."

18:27.512 --> 18:31.715
And I felt like the whole world
was behind me.

18:32.651 --> 18:34.319
And the bell ran and I turn around and

18:34.420 --> 18:36.788
I see this guy
running at me like a train.

18:36.889 --> 18:38.490
He keeps on coming and I'm waiting

18:38.591 --> 18:43.862
and he's coming and when I get
right in front of him I punch him!

18:43.963 --> 18:45.997
I'll never forget it,
he's flying in slow motion,

18:46.098 --> 18:48.934
lands in the canvas
and I look around and

18:49.035 --> 18:51.837
your Uncle Jose jumps

18:51.938 --> 18:55.872
and hug me and says
"I told you you can do it."

18:56.574 --> 19:01.277
And what I learned from that
is that you never give up.

19:02.681 --> 19:05.115
And you'll never give up.

19:06.318 --> 19:09.921
Cause I'm a champion
and you're a champion.

19:10.022 --> 19:15.125
So you're going to be fine.
You're going to be fine, baby.

19:16.227 --> 19:20.365
Very impressive, Mrs. Chavez.

19:20.466 --> 19:24.336
You seem to be a little
over qualified for the job,

19:24.437 --> 19:29.005
but I think I can hire you right away.

19:31.176 --> 19:35.313
Thank you, Mr. White.
That's great, thank you.

19:35.414 --> 19:39.115
You seem to really want to get this job.

19:39.718 --> 19:43.054
Yes, my husband and I have
been out of work for months

19:43.155 --> 19:47.425
and we're up to our neck
in bills and my son is...

19:47.526 --> 19:49.261
Hey, come on.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.930
I've been in difficult situations too.

19:52.031 --> 19:54.464
I completely understand.

19:54.666 --> 19:56.301
I'm sorry, I'm so nervous.

19:56.402 --> 19:59.903
This job just means
the world to us, thank you.

20:01.606 --> 20:07.212
You have nothing to be sorry
or nervous about.

20:07.313 --> 20:11.047
I want you to know, if you help me out,

20:11.616 --> 20:13.118
I'll help you out.

20:13.219 --> 20:15.820
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

20:15.921 --> 20:18.922
Now that's what I want to hear.

20:24.262 --> 20:26.197
How about showing me your gratitude and

20:26.298 --> 20:30.533
giving me some...
special attention, huh?

20:34.672 --> 20:37.240
You son of a bitch!

20:38.276 --> 20:41.578
My husband is a fighter and so am I.

20:42.313 --> 20:44.449
Bastard.

20:44.550 --> 20:46.818
<i>The police has informed us
that Hernandez,</i>

20:46.919 --> 20:48.954
<i>who in the last 6 months lost his job,</i>

20:49.055 --> 20:52.624
<i>cars and homes, took a gun
and shot his two children,</i>

20:52.725 --> 20:56.628
<i>his wife and then himself
around midnight last night.</i>

20:56.729 --> 20:59.931
<i>Moving on the Dwayne "Storm"
Johnson with the weather.</i>

21:00.032 --> 21:01.700
<i>Thank you, Biff.</i>

21:01.801 --> 21:03.902
<i>For most of South California
the Santa Ana winds</i>

21:04.003 --> 21:07.437
<i>have made a mess of things
everywhere last night...</i>

21:29.928 --> 21:31.696
Hey, Buddy.

21:31.797 --> 21:35.198
Yes sir, what can I do for you?

21:36.134 --> 21:37.569
I have a beauty here for you.

21:37.670 --> 21:40.739
- Let me take a look at it.
- Look at that.

21:40.840 --> 21:43.675
Oh, yeah that's nice.

21:43.776 --> 21:47.412
- How much you asking?
- I don't know, maybe 500?

21:47.513 --> 21:51.282
Okay, the best I can do is 200 dollars.

21:51.383 --> 21:54.118
Look, I really need the money.

21:54.219 --> 21:56.986
I have a sick kid right here.

21:57.188 --> 22:01.424
I'm sorry. 200, that's it.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.095
Okay, we'll take it.

22:10.435 --> 22:13.970
Boss, I'm afraid I have some bad news.

22:14.672 --> 22:15.940
Spit it out.

22:16.041 --> 22:18.510
Champs last opponent, Ronald Cash,

22:18.611 --> 22:22.347
was found unconscious in his room
and is now in a coma.

22:22.448 --> 22:25.583
Doctor thinks it might be due
to the beating from Cage.

22:25.684 --> 22:28.186
The doctor thinks that maybe

22:28.287 --> 22:32.323
Cash's injuries were caused
by the Champ's punishment.

22:32.424 --> 22:36.361
Let me tell you something about doctors
they don't know each and every thing.

22:36.462 --> 22:40.732
When my mother was pregnant with me,
they said I was a cyst.

22:40.833 --> 22:44.903
They said they had to open her up
and removed me immediately.

22:45.004 --> 22:49.474
Tell our PR department to wait
a respectable couple of hours

22:49.575 --> 22:53.011
and then to announce
that Ultimate Extreme Combat

22:53.112 --> 22:55.580
is going to have
a massive tribute benefit

22:55.681 --> 23:00.852
to show our respect
in the only way that MMA knows how.

23:00.953 --> 23:03.021
- I don't know...
- Listen,

23:03.122 --> 23:06.091
warriors got to go to war,
the show must go on.

23:06.192 --> 23:07.892
That's gonna cause a media shit storm.

23:07.993 --> 23:09.561
And we're gonna shy
from the controversy?

23:09.662 --> 23:11.729
That's what puts butts in the seats.

23:11.830 --> 23:16.000
Shows got to have that narrative
to twirl the turn styles.

23:16.101 --> 23:18.236
And besides, the Champ's supposed to

23:18.337 --> 23:22.105
never fight again if Cash
doesn't come out of his coma.

23:26.678 --> 23:29.012
Where have you guys been?

23:29.948 --> 23:34.584
We were just in the park
having a great time and missing you.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.654
How was your interview?

23:39.390 --> 23:43.092
Not very good, I don't think
they're gonna ask me back.

23:44.829 --> 23:47.030
That's okay, don't worry.

23:47.131 --> 23:49.467
I sold Dad's gun...

23:49.568 --> 23:52.602
so I was thinking maybe you and I can...

23:53.238 --> 23:56.574
go out for a nice dinner,
what do you say?

23:56.675 --> 24:00.345
- Where were you thinking?
- Well, something very fancy.

24:00.446 --> 24:06.182
Maybe, we get a Big Mac
or something like that.

24:07.085 --> 24:11.487
That sounds tempting, maybe tomorrow.

24:14.158 --> 24:18.127
Okay, tomorrow.

24:30.475 --> 24:34.345
Hey Ian, I haven't seen you in two days,
tomorrow's the fight,

24:34.446 --> 24:36.247
<i>you have to be there, okay?</i>

24:36.348 --> 24:37.882
- Hey, Champ.
- Ian?

24:37.983 --> 24:40.318
I'm not going to be able
to make the fight tomorrow.

24:40.419 --> 24:42.687
Maria's gonna go be there instead,
everything's gonna be great.

24:42.788 --> 24:44.923
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, everything is good.

24:45.024 --> 24:47.723
I wish you the best. See you soon.

24:48.326 --> 24:50.528
Like I was saying, you little fuck,

24:50.629 --> 24:52.497
you have three days to get to 15 grand.

24:52.598 --> 24:56.599
Three fucking days, or you're dead.

25:14.853 --> 25:17.253
That's gonna hurt.

25:49.287 --> 25:51.022
Yeah!

25:51.123 --> 25:53.324
Come on! Come on!

26:01.566 --> 26:03.533
Oh, shit!

26:33.936 --> 26:36.232
Yeah!

26:37.201 --> 26:40.104
Oh, shit, this is fantastic.

26:40.205 --> 26:42.507
Hey, I got to take care
of some business.

26:42.608 --> 26:46.642
You guys wait here for me.
Come on, let's go.

26:50.783 --> 26:53.418
Where's Tony?
We've been here for an hour.

26:53.519 --> 26:55.753
This guy looks like a crook to me.

26:55.854 --> 26:58.389
He's not a crook, he's a good friend.

26:58.490 --> 27:00.558
I don't know, Hector.

27:00.659 --> 27:03.526
I'm telling you, I trust this guy.

27:05.630 --> 27:07.665
Hey!

27:07.766 --> 27:10.368
I'm sorry I'm late, I had some things
to take care of.

27:10.469 --> 27:13.438
- Great fight though.
- Thanks, Tony.

27:13.539 --> 27:16.207
- Who's the girl?
- She's Ian's girlfriend,

27:16.308 --> 27:19.543
don't worry about it.
Do you have my money?

27:19.644 --> 27:21.412
What's with the attitude?

27:21.513 --> 27:24.382
Come on, take your girl,
we'll go have a drink.

27:24.483 --> 27:26.484
I don't want a drink.

27:26.585 --> 27:28.686
I want my money,
we've been here for an hour.

27:28.787 --> 27:31.456
I don't have your money right now.

27:31.557 --> 27:35.193
You don't have my money?
Are you fucking kidding me?

27:35.294 --> 27:36.928
You're going to have to wait.

27:37.029 --> 27:40.832
You motherfucker listen to me,
you get me the money now,

27:40.933 --> 27:42.433
I need it now.

27:42.534 --> 27:45.268
Who the hell do you think
you are talking to?

27:46.771 --> 27:49.807
You son of a bitch.
Are you fucking playing with me?

27:49.908 --> 27:54.644
- I want my money now!
- Roscoe! Jake!

28:02.086 --> 28:04.288
You son of a bitch.

28:04.389 --> 28:06.856
Get the hell out of here.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.261
Let's go.

28:15.467 --> 28:17.933
I trusted you, motherfucker.

28:28.380 --> 28:32.650
Hey, another great fight pretty boy.

28:32.751 --> 28:37.321
Although my guy Juan says
he could still kick your ass.

28:37.422 --> 28:40.691
So what do you say Champ,
you ready to go?

28:40.792 --> 28:45.828
- Maybe another day, huh?
- What happened? You afraid?

28:46.731 --> 28:51.100
Look, I just had a fight.
Another day for sure, huh?

28:51.969 --> 28:56.005
Hey! I'm going to hold you
accountable, okay?

29:36.281 --> 29:37.782
Are you Hector Chavez?

29:37.883 --> 29:42.520
- Who are you?
- Are you Hector Chavez?

29:42.621 --> 29:45.790
- Yes, who the fuck are you?
- Never mind who I am.

29:45.891 --> 29:49.425
Somebody very important
wants to talk to you.

30:07.378 --> 30:10.479
Mr. Hector Chavez...

30:10.648 --> 30:13.184
Really, very nice to meet you.

30:13.285 --> 30:14.719
I'm a big fan.

30:14.820 --> 30:17.653
- My name is John...
- John Stone.

30:18.589 --> 30:20.691
Why are you in a neighborhood like this?

30:20.792 --> 30:22.560
I'm here to make you an offer

30:22.661 --> 30:25.563
I think you'll find both
stimulating and profitable.

30:25.664 --> 30:27.999
- And what is that?
- How would you like to fight

30:28.100 --> 30:30.601
the champion of the world
in mixed martial arts

30:30.702 --> 30:34.572
in our biggest event ever,
the 100 Mixed Martial Arts Colossus

30:34.673 --> 30:36.941
right here, in beautiful Los Angeles?

30:37.042 --> 30:40.111
- Is this a joke?
- No, of course not.

30:40.212 --> 30:42.914
Look, you're a big star
in fighting on the web.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.550
And that's how young people
connect these days.

30:45.651 --> 30:47.184
So what would make greater sense

30:47.285 --> 30:49.820
than to bring our biggest champion
against you,

30:49.921 --> 30:51.989
the biggest star of the Internet?

30:52.090 --> 30:54.692
- I don't know.
- We'd be willing to offer you

30:54.793 --> 30:57.461
$100,000 to say yes.

30:57.562 --> 31:00.932
Maybe that could help you
to get out of this place.

31:01.033 --> 31:04.233
You fight in three weeks
on Cinco de Mayo.

31:04.735 --> 31:06.537
Can talk this over with my wife?

31:06.638 --> 31:09.340
Of course, the wife is very important
to any deal.

31:09.441 --> 31:12.777
Look, I'll give you my card.
I'll expect your call tomorrow.

31:12.878 --> 31:15.713
I really do hope
you'll join us, Mr. Chavez,

31:15.814 --> 31:19.784
- I'm sure you'll go far.
- Thank you, thank you.

31:19.885 --> 31:22.117
Goodnight, Mr. Chavez.

31:23.020 --> 31:24.987
Wow!

31:42.206 --> 31:45.743
<i>This is the first exclusive look
at Hector Chavez,</i>

31:45.844 --> 31:49.447
<i>the new contender of the current
world MMA champion,</i>

31:49.548 --> 31:51.082
<i>Cage the Destroyer Fury.</i>

31:51.183 --> 31:53.417
<i>The fight is set to take place
on Cinco de Mayo</i>

31:53.518 --> 31:55.186
<i>in LA, California.</i>

31:55.287 --> 31:57.755
<i>Joining us via satellite
is the Champ, Cage Fury.</i>

31:57.856 --> 32:00.691
<i>- Thanks for joining us today.
- My pleasure.</i>

32:00.792 --> 32:04.028
<i>Alright, well you have had
a truly amazing career,</i>

32:04.129 --> 32:06.797
<i>You're known as one
of the most vicious finishers</i>

32:06.898 --> 32:08.833
<i>in all of the MMA</i>

32:08.934 --> 32:12.403
<i>and you've knocked out a total

32:12.504 --> 32:16.874
<i>I mean you truly are the Destroyer.
So I'm really curious,</i>

32:16.975 --> 32:19.143
<i>what are your predictions
for this upcoming fight?</i>

32:19.244 --> 32:20.878
<i>My predictions for this fight are</i>

32:20.979 --> 32:23.614
<i>I'm gonna send the wetback,
back to Mexico in a body bag.</i>

32:23.715 --> 32:27.016
<i>My prediction is war. Death.</i>

32:34.425 --> 32:37.293
- I'm sorry.
- One second, honey.

32:38.729 --> 32:40.431
- Yes?
- I'm Hector Chavez,

32:40.532 --> 32:42.733
my son was rushed here in an emergency.

32:42.834 --> 32:45.336
His name is Martin
and my wife's is Gia Chavez.

32:45.437 --> 32:47.803
Let me check, honey.

32:49.707 --> 32:51.409
I'm sorry, what was your name?

32:51.510 --> 32:53.210
- Hector Chavez.
- Oh!

32:53.311 --> 32:56.414
Aren't you the guy fighting
in all those videos?

32:56.515 --> 32:58.582
That's why you look so familiar.

32:58.683 --> 33:00.718
Your name's been all over the news.

33:00.819 --> 33:02.453
Did you say all over the news?

33:02.554 --> 33:06.023
Yes, now are you really
going to fight this Cage Fury?

33:06.124 --> 33:09.291
He's a beast,
you better be careful, boy.

33:11.729 --> 33:15.598
- Your family is in room 223.
- Thanks.

33:23.440 --> 33:24.775
How's he doing?

33:24.876 --> 33:27.643
He has to be operated on by next week.

33:27.845 --> 33:30.214
It's okay, we're going to be fine.

33:30.315 --> 33:31.649
I got some good news.

33:31.750 --> 33:33.517
That you're going to fight
the Cage Fury?

33:33.618 --> 33:35.386
- How did you know?
- How do I know?

33:35.487 --> 33:37.054
It's been all over the news,

33:37.155 --> 33:39.423
how could you accept it
without consulting me first?

33:39.524 --> 33:43.461
They did offer me the fight,
but I didn't accept yet.

33:43.562 --> 33:45.129
So everybody is lying, then.

33:45.230 --> 33:48.165
I don't know, baby,
maybe they jumped the gun.

33:48.266 --> 33:50.601
They did offer me
the fight but I told them

33:50.702 --> 33:52.002
I have to talk to you first.

33:52.103 --> 33:56.907
Hector, I've been thinking about this,
and this is crazy.

33:57.008 --> 33:59.110
You've fought 8 times
in the last two months

33:59.211 --> 34:01.712
for a lousy 200 dollars a fight.

34:01.813 --> 34:06.317
Look at your face.
He's going to kill you.

34:06.418 --> 34:10.353
I'm not going to sit here
and watch my son die and you die too.

34:10.455 --> 34:13.056
You have to at least et me try.

34:13.158 --> 34:15.926
I won't be part of your death, Hector.

34:16.027 --> 34:19.996
Look baby, it's our only way out.

34:20.098 --> 34:23.931
I have a bad feeling about this fight.

34:28.572 --> 34:30.938
Mr. Chavez, wait!

34:31.842 --> 34:33.944
Do you mind signing an autograph for me?

34:34.045 --> 34:38.815
I'm a big fan of MMA, I love the sport,
I watch every fight.

34:38.917 --> 34:40.351
Of course not.

34:40.452 --> 34:46.524
And that's for Tairrie.
T, A, I, R, R, I, E.

34:46.625 --> 34:50.694
And you can put something like,
"To the Beautiful Nurse."

34:50.795 --> 34:53.161
- Okay.
- Thank you.

34:54.632 --> 34:57.301
- Thank you...
- Thank you.

34:57.402 --> 35:01.872
Now you better be careful
and protect that cute little butt.

35:14.219 --> 35:17.119
I know I haven't been here in a while.

35:17.888 --> 35:20.255
A long while.

35:22.726 --> 35:25.260
But I don't know who to turn to.

35:26.897 --> 35:29.098
I need your help.

35:30.901 --> 35:33.202
I need your help badly.

35:35.706 --> 35:38.440
Please, God, tell me what to do.

35:42.146 --> 35:46.381
Hector? I'm back here.

35:50.120 --> 35:52.323
Man, you scared the heck out of me.

35:52.424 --> 35:54.992
Took you long enough
to show up in church.

35:55.093 --> 35:58.827
What is it, one year? Ha.

36:07.438 --> 36:10.140
Is everything okay? Why are you here?

36:10.241 --> 36:16.478
Well, Martin is in the hospital,
he needs surgery right away.

36:20.784 --> 36:24.054
Listen, they offered me
to fight Cage Fury,

36:24.155 --> 36:27.658
the MMA World Champion,
$100,000 in three weeks.

36:27.759 --> 36:29.293
Whoa.

36:29.394 --> 36:34.031
Of course my wife doesn't want me
to do it, but I have to do it.

36:34.132 --> 36:36.832
It's the only way out for me.

36:37.134 --> 36:40.704
You have to do it.
Gia doesn't want you to?

36:40.805 --> 36:42.373
No.

36:42.474 --> 36:45.175
Well, you have to understand
that she loves you.

36:45.276 --> 36:47.378
She doesn't want to see hurt.

36:47.479 --> 36:49.680
Nobody does Hector.

36:49.781 --> 36:51.315
But you have to do what you have to do.

36:51.416 --> 36:53.851
And she'll be there waiting for you.

36:53.952 --> 36:59.555
She'll back you 100%
and I will too, always.

37:00.858 --> 37:02.660
Thank you.

37:02.761 --> 37:04.495
What else did you come to ask me?

37:04.596 --> 37:10.167
I was wondering if you could
help me train for the fight?

37:10.268 --> 37:15.105
Yeah, I'll train you.
But you have to work really hard.

37:15.206 --> 37:17.573
I don't want you to get hurt.

37:17.808 --> 37:20.475
You have to do everything I say.

37:21.045 --> 37:24.081
- First you gotta pray.
- Yes, sir.

37:24.182 --> 37:26.415
I knew you'd say that.

37:48.305 --> 37:51.508
To you. You know
you're a very attractive woman?

37:51.609 --> 37:54.511
- I'm glad you think so.
- Do you know what this is?

37:54.612 --> 37:58.482
- What?
- That's the Virginia state seal.

37:58.583 --> 38:02.686
More presidents come from Virginia
than any other state.

38:02.787 --> 38:05.889
- I come from Virginia.
- So do I.

38:05.990 --> 38:08.359
That's something we have in common then.

38:15.199 --> 38:19.067
Yeah, Mr. Hector Chavez.

38:19.770 --> 38:24.141
Well, that's a very dynamic decision,
Mr. Hector Chavez.

38:24.242 --> 38:28.879
We'll call you tomorrow
about the signing of the agreement.

38:28.980 --> 38:31.580
Congratulations, Challenger.

38:34.318 --> 38:36.854
Your fight is official,
Champ, here here!

38:36.955 --> 38:40.791
Good. I want your guys to get
as much dirt as they can on him.

38:40.892 --> 38:42.826
I want this to be
the fight of the century.

38:42.927 --> 38:45.095
Consider it done.

38:45.196 --> 38:48.098
I'm gonna take this Mexican
on a ride to hell.

38:48.199 --> 38:49.833
You're so mean, papi.

38:49.934 --> 38:52.200
You're so bad!

38:58.342 --> 39:01.677
Oh, God, I'm going to be late.

39:01.812 --> 39:04.448
Uh, babe, hey listen.

39:04.549 --> 39:06.116
I wanted ask you.

39:06.217 --> 39:08.585
Could you just lend me
a little bit of money,

39:08.686 --> 39:10.521
maybe like 300 bucks?

39:10.622 --> 39:14.258
- What is it for?
- Just some business.

39:14.359 --> 39:16.760
Something came up.
You know I'm good for it.

39:16.861 --> 39:18.562
- I'll pay you back.
- Look,

39:18.663 --> 39:21.265
you already owe me $1,000

39:21.366 --> 39:23.434
you'd give me it back
three poker games ago.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.569
I know. Babe, this time it's different.

39:25.670 --> 39:28.572
I can feel it, I can feel it this time.

39:28.673 --> 39:31.008
I'm going to win!
I've been playing this game

39:31.109 --> 39:33.610
since I was 13 years old,
you gotta trust me,

39:33.711 --> 39:35.312
this is my jackpot, okay?

39:35.413 --> 39:37.714
I promise you I'm going to win.

39:37.815 --> 39:40.617
I don't care about the money.
All I care about is you.

39:40.718 --> 39:44.021
So promise me that this is
going to be the last time.

39:44.122 --> 39:47.124
I promise, Maria. I love you.

39:47.225 --> 39:50.125
Alright, I promise, last time.

39:52.796 --> 39:56.264
- Take it.
- Thank you.

39:59.870 --> 40:03.607
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

40:03.708 --> 40:06.174
I shall fear no evil

40:06.510 --> 40:09.146
for Thou art with me always.

40:09.247 --> 40:11.615
Thy rod and Thy staff,

40:11.716 --> 40:14.118
they comfort me.

40:14.219 --> 40:16.220
I believe in God the Father Almighty,

40:16.321 --> 40:18.155
creator of heaven and earth

40:18.256 --> 40:21.091
and in Jesus Christ,
His only son our Lord.

40:22.894 --> 40:26.897
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
born of the virgin Mary...

41:01.398 --> 41:05.133
And life everlasting, amen.

41:20.884 --> 41:23.585
Good time, Champ. Looking good.

41:23.920 --> 41:26.088
Mean!

41:30.727 --> 41:34.629
That a'boy, Champ. Nice!

41:36.266 --> 41:39.770
Not bad, not bad, compadre.

41:43.473 --> 41:45.108
Ha.

41:45.209 --> 41:46.910
What do you want?

41:47.011 --> 41:49.613
You finally hit the big times
and you ask me what I want?

41:49.714 --> 41:53.748
- What the hell do you want?
- Shut up, midget!

41:54.918 --> 41:59.621
I'm not talking to you.
When I say "shit" then you talk.

42:05.028 --> 42:07.496
Yeah, homie,

42:08.765 --> 42:10.525
finally got a big break.

42:13.603 --> 42:17.772
Hope you're not going
to forget your old friends.

42:18.208 --> 42:20.243
Hector!

42:24.247 --> 42:26.583
Now here is the deal,

42:26.684 --> 42:30.954
I want you to wear our gang colors
on your shorts.

42:31.055 --> 42:33.255
Secondly,

42:35.325 --> 42:38.193
you come work for us now.

42:39.229 --> 42:40.731
Look, Mando,

42:40.832 --> 42:43.934
I never gave you or any
of you guys any trouble, okay?

42:44.035 --> 42:46.637
I always earn my living honestly.

42:46.738 --> 42:49.671
So I'm going to ask you respectfully

42:50.240 --> 42:52.641
to leave me alone please.

42:54.878 --> 42:56.912
Respectfully?!

42:58.115 --> 43:00.916
This isn't respectfully, bullshit.

43:01.685 --> 43:05.620
Now you listen, and you listen good!

43:07.924 --> 43:09.893
Hector!

43:09.994 --> 43:12.129
- Drop the gun.
- Let him go.

43:12.230 --> 43:13.964
- Drop it!
- Let him go!

43:14.065 --> 43:17.100
Drop the gun, drop it!

43:18.369 --> 43:20.535
What's going on here?

43:22.973 --> 43:25.273
What's going on?

43:25.742 --> 43:28.945
Nothing, Mando just stopped to say hi.

43:29.046 --> 43:31.346
They're leaving now.

43:31.848 --> 43:36.186
Hello, Mando, nice of you
to finally come to church.

43:36.287 --> 43:39.256
- Fuck you, priest!
- Watch your mouth.

43:39.357 --> 43:41.758
You're in the house of the Lord.

43:41.859 --> 43:45.493
Fuck you, Father. And fuck Jesus, too.

43:47.063 --> 43:48.965
I told you to watch your mouth.

43:49.066 --> 43:51.666
What's the matter with you guys?

43:54.171 --> 43:56.573
This isn't over, pretty boy.

43:56.674 --> 44:01.243
Stay away from this priest,
you'll get your ass killed.

44:33.910 --> 44:37.681
- How are you guys doing?
- We're okay. How are you?

44:37.782 --> 44:41.783
Okay. I start training today.

44:42.419 --> 44:44.588
I see.

44:44.689 --> 44:49.926
Mr. and Mrs. Chavez,
I have Martin's latest test results.

44:50.027 --> 44:53.497
I'm afraid he's too weak
to perform the surgery.

44:53.598 --> 44:56.666
We need to build up his immune system,
his red blood cells,

44:56.767 --> 44:58.769
and strengthen his body.

44:58.870 --> 45:02.973
So we want to keep him here
to help him get stronger

45:03.074 --> 45:04.975
and monitor his progress.

45:05.076 --> 45:09.644
Then I think we can perform
the surgery May 5th.

45:10.313 --> 45:11.848
Any problem with that date?

45:11.949 --> 45:14.951
That's the earliest
the surgical team is available.

45:15.052 --> 45:16.753
No, that's ok.

45:16.854 --> 45:20.056
We'll do anything to make sure
the operation is a success.

45:20.157 --> 45:21.825
It's going to cost more money.

45:21.926 --> 45:25.829
You'll have to take it up
with our financial department.

45:25.930 --> 45:28.698
We'll take care of it.
Thank you so much for your time.

45:28.799 --> 45:32.602
Listen, I assure you
we will do everything we can

45:32.703 --> 45:34.771
to get Martin safe and sound.

45:34.872 --> 45:36.840
But you two take care of each other.

45:36.941 --> 45:39.674
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

45:42.412 --> 45:44.512
Can we walk out?

45:48.418 --> 45:50.618
Yes.

45:59.829 --> 46:04.401
If we apply for unemployment
we can get $200 a month.

46:04.502 --> 46:08.605
The hospital's financial aid department
can take care of the rest of the bills.

46:08.706 --> 46:13.510
Why don't you let me figure this out first
before you go fighting this monster.

46:13.611 --> 46:15.445
How many times have I told you?

46:15.546 --> 46:17.481
I don't bother others with my problems.

46:17.582 --> 46:20.849
I want to take care of my family myself.

46:21.418 --> 46:23.587
I know how proud you are

46:23.688 --> 46:27.791
and you've always taken
such good care of Martin and I,

46:27.892 --> 46:32.696
but sometimes life steps all over you
and leaves you no way out.

46:32.797 --> 46:35.499
And you have to accept help
from other people.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.367
There's nothing wrong with that.

46:37.468 --> 46:41.703
We have a way out and it's the fight.

46:42.839 --> 46:47.210
Look, I know you're afraid,
so am I, okay?

46:47.311 --> 46:50.612
- Then don't do it.
- I have to do it.

46:51.281 --> 46:53.482
I have to do it for you.

46:53.583 --> 46:55.884
I have to do it for Martin.

46:56.419 --> 47:00.522
But we're lucky, we have a way out

47:01.224 --> 47:03.558
and it's the fight.

47:04.661 --> 47:07.796
You're gonna have to do this
one on your own.

47:12.402 --> 47:14.836
I'm gonna have to do this alone?

47:17.474 --> 47:19.941
I'm gonna have to do this alone.

47:26.149 --> 47:28.385
I'm never gonna be alone.

47:28.486 --> 47:31.719
You and Martin will always be within me.

47:32.222 --> 47:34.656
Jose is helping me train.

47:35.725 --> 47:38.760
And for the first time in my life,

47:39.062 --> 47:41.598
there's people that love my fighting.

47:41.699 --> 47:45.066
You can die giving people
what they love.

47:46.836 --> 47:50.373
There lies Ronald Cash in a coma
he got from the beating

47:50.474 --> 47:53.174
from the guy you are going to fight.

47:54.044 --> 47:56.980
Hector, is this what
you're asking of us?

47:57.081 --> 47:59.783
Martin an orphan and me
a widow, that's our future?

47:59.884 --> 48:02.484
No, we have to do this.

48:02.852 --> 48:05.822
Maybe this is a way out for us.

48:05.923 --> 48:08.925
People can believe
there's a way out for them.

48:09.026 --> 48:14.662
No Hector, they will wake up everyday
and do that same shit they always do.

48:15.865 --> 48:19.969
Don't do this, please.

48:46.830 --> 48:48.565
Where the hell is this guy?

48:51.735 --> 48:53.603
Turn here.

49:11.821 --> 49:14.324
That's the one who burnt your cousin?

49:14.425 --> 49:17.293
- You got the wrong guy.
- No, you're the right bitch.

49:17.394 --> 49:19.595
I know one when I see one.

49:19.696 --> 49:21.996
Come on, get up.

49:36.947 --> 49:40.315
- Kill that motherfucker!
- Time to die, bitch!

49:45.256 --> 49:48.323
- The cops are coming!
- Vámonos, let's go!

49:56.600 --> 49:59.334
Mr. Stone is ready to see you guys.

50:05.508 --> 50:08.144
Mr. Hector Chavez, how nice to see you.

50:08.245 --> 50:09.579
Nice seeing you, sir.

50:09.680 --> 50:11.648
This is my right hand man, Steve White.

50:11.749 --> 50:13.817
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

50:13.918 --> 50:16.453
This is my right hand, Ian Raven.

50:16.554 --> 50:18.922
Pleasure, sir. Sir, good to meet you.

50:19.023 --> 50:22.258
We have your contract ready
if you'll just initial each page

50:22.359 --> 50:26.928
and sign execute the last page,
we'll give you your deposit.

50:29.399 --> 50:32.469
And now we're going to take you
out to our media launch room

50:32.570 --> 50:35.739
for our pre-fight press conference.

50:35.840 --> 50:38.842
- Congratulations, Challenger.
- Thank you.

50:38.943 --> 50:43.980
And your deposit, Mr. Chavez. $30,000.

50:44.081 --> 50:46.983
I have to say I'm a big fan of yours.

50:47.084 --> 50:48.151
Thank you.

50:48.252 --> 50:50.086
There's one caviot, if any pundit

50:50.187 --> 50:52.388
brings up the issue
of your late selection,

50:52.489 --> 50:56.993
we'll just say it was to preserve
the privacy of your family.

50:57.094 --> 51:00.828
- Yes, sir.
- Let's put on a good show.

51:03.533 --> 51:07.470
How's it feel big guy? 30g's.

51:07.571 --> 51:12.375
I'm going to have to run out
just a minute earlier, ok?

51:12.476 --> 51:14.377
- Are you kidding me?
- Champ,

51:14.478 --> 51:18.014
you know I wouldn't ask
unless it was important.

51:18.115 --> 51:22.350
You're going to be fine
and kill this thing. We made it!

51:31.394 --> 51:36.032
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome...

51:36.133 --> 51:38.034
to the launch press conference

51:38.135 --> 51:43.673
of the 100th MMA heavy weight
championship of the world event.

51:43.774 --> 51:46.009
This event, we are so excited about it

51:46.110 --> 51:49.379
because we captured
the attention of LA community

51:49.480 --> 51:53.583
and the hearts and minds of people
all over the world.

51:53.684 --> 51:55.985
Right now, today we have
press from Japan,

51:56.086 --> 52:00.456
Saudi Arabia, South Africa,
Russia, Malaysia, India.

52:00.557 --> 52:02.091
Today we are one world

52:02.192 --> 52:06.260
under the banner of ultimate
extreme combat today.

52:07.931 --> 52:10.031
Give me one.

52:12.168 --> 52:16.206
I'm going to start first
with the undisputed reigning,

52:16.307 --> 52:18.007
physicist of pain,

52:18.108 --> 52:21.044
the heavy weight mixed martial
arts champion of the world.

52:21.145 --> 52:23.513
The indestructible force majeure,

52:23.614 --> 52:27.281
Cage the Destroyer Fury!

52:32.522 --> 52:34.691
And his challenger.

52:34.792 --> 52:36.993
A man hailed
by the Latin-American community

52:37.094 --> 52:38.862
as the people's champion.

52:38.963 --> 52:43.132
Seized from the digital age,
up from the urban ethnic trenches.

52:43.233 --> 52:45.602
Ladies and gentleman, I give you

52:45.703 --> 52:50.138
Hector the Mexican Chavez!

52:59.382 --> 53:01.349
I'm out.

53:05.321 --> 53:06.489
All in.

53:06.590 --> 53:09.225
Now, please,
let the press conference begin.

53:09.326 --> 53:11.628
Fire up your questions.
Yes, the lady there.

53:11.729 --> 53:14.697
You've had problems finding
an opponent for the Champ,

53:14.798 --> 53:16.332
do you think Mr. Chavez

53:16.433 --> 53:18.701
will pose any sort
of a challenge whatsoever?

53:18.802 --> 53:21.471
Ma'am, we've studied Mr. Chavez's fights

53:21.572 --> 53:23.172
very, very carefully and

53:23.273 --> 53:25.942
I made my decision based
on what he's already proven,

53:26.043 --> 53:28.309
which is substantial.

53:33.884 --> 53:37.151
- Oh, got you.
- How's it feel?

53:38.254 --> 53:40.256
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Chavez, all due respect,

53:40.357 --> 53:43.059
do you think you have
a shot against him?

53:43.160 --> 53:47.997
Look, I know I have
only a few MMA fights,

53:48.098 --> 53:50.600
but I've been fighting all my life.

53:50.701 --> 53:52.468
And I'd have never taken this fight,

53:52.569 --> 53:56.439
if I didn't know in my heart,
that I can win it.

53:56.540 --> 53:59.042
What do you have to say to that, Champ?

53:59.143 --> 54:00.810
I don't care who they put
in front of me,

54:00.911 --> 54:02.745
I'm here to prove I'm king of this cage.

54:02.846 --> 54:05.114
I'll fight anybody the organization
puts in front of me

54:05.215 --> 54:08.351
and prove I'm the best
MMA fighter of all time.

54:08.452 --> 54:12.520
Mr. Chavez, do you think
you'll even last one round?

54:14.157 --> 54:19.963
I know I can go toe to toe
with the Champ all five rounds.

54:20.064 --> 54:24.567
And I promise you guys
a fight you'll never forget.

54:24.668 --> 54:26.269
Watch what you say, wetback.

54:26.370 --> 54:28.638
I'm going to wipe that smirk
off your face.

54:28.739 --> 54:30.273
When I leave you for dead.

54:30.374 --> 54:33.309
Like your mom and dad left you
and your brother.

54:33.410 --> 54:36.612
Just like you left your wife
and your sick kid.

54:36.713 --> 54:39.415
Just like you left your family
when they needed you most.

54:39.516 --> 54:42.986
No, no. Guys.
Leave it in the ring, boys.

54:43.087 --> 54:46.489
Ladies and gentlemen, the thrills
and chills start right now.

54:46.590 --> 54:49.523
This is ultimate extreme combat.

54:49.826 --> 54:51.527
Coming up.

54:51.628 --> 54:53.830
<i>That was the incredible scene
at the press conference</i>

54:53.931 --> 54:55.431
<i>with the fight scheduled May 5th,</i>

54:55.532 --> 54:57.367
<i>between Hector the Mexican Chavez</i>

54:57.468 --> 54:59.869
<i>and world heavy weight
champion Cage Fury,</i>

54:59.970 --> 55:01.971
<i>who revealed that Chavez
and his brother</i>

55:02.072 --> 55:04.040
<i>had been abandoned as children</i>

55:04.141 --> 55:07.143
<i>and then alleged that Chavez
had left his own family</i>

55:07.244 --> 55:08.978
<i>a wife and sick child,</i>

55:09.079 --> 55:11.581
<i>when they supposedly
needed him the most.</i>

55:11.682 --> 55:14.851
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

55:14.952 --> 55:16.719
Did Dad leave us?

55:16.820 --> 55:21.224
No, no baby. That's just lies
from a very bad man.

55:21.325 --> 55:23.459
Your daddy loves us more then ever.

55:23.560 --> 55:26.994
Is Dad going to fight the bad man?

55:27.196 --> 55:28.531
I'm afraid so.

55:28.632 --> 55:32.068
Don't worry Mom, my Dad is a superhero.

55:32.169 --> 55:36.537
- He always wins.
- Yes, he does.

55:41.478 --> 55:43.446
Hey, it's your man, Hector Chavez.

55:43.547 --> 55:45.081
Fuck Hector, man.

55:45.182 --> 55:47.116
That dude left his wife
and his sick kid.

55:47.217 --> 55:48.851
Saw on the news last night.

55:48.952 --> 55:52.221
Man, fuck you, Chavez.
I hope Cage whoops your ass...

56:03.734 --> 56:05.034
Come in.

56:05.135 --> 56:07.568
Is the famous Martin Chavez here?

56:07.837 --> 56:09.705
Daddy...

56:09.806 --> 56:12.139
How are you doing, buddy?

56:12.775 --> 56:14.377
Not much, stronger.

56:14.478 --> 56:18.079
I can see that. Let me see your muscles.

56:18.581 --> 56:21.184
That's pretty good, look at you.

56:21.285 --> 56:24.385
Are you going to fight the bad man?

56:25.321 --> 56:28.458
- I'm afraid so.
- Can you promise me you'll win?

56:28.559 --> 56:30.393
I promise you I can do my best.

56:30.494 --> 56:34.130
Where's my present for not
telling me about this deal?

56:34.231 --> 56:36.697
Your present?

56:36.799 --> 56:39.400
It's right here with me.

56:39.602 --> 56:41.502
It's my heart.

56:53.849 --> 56:56.183
He's a killing machine.

56:56.919 --> 56:59.054
What's the plan?

56:59.155 --> 57:01.491
Prove his speed and power.

57:01.592 --> 57:04.658
He wants to be as explosive
as he can be.

57:05.094 --> 57:07.762
Like an atomic bomb!

57:09.098 --> 57:12.600
- How're you feeling, Champ?
- Spectacular.

57:17.540 --> 57:21.677
I want the Champ to knock out
the Mexican in the first round.

57:21.778 --> 57:24.145
We can't look bad.

57:24.714 --> 57:28.382
After all, we're the professionals.

57:29.885 --> 57:32.486
Don't worry, I got it covered.

57:33.222 --> 57:36.624
More hip, Champ, more hip!

57:37.293 --> 57:39.395
I'll tell you, Hector, it made me sick

57:39.496 --> 57:42.732
listening to him talk all that garbage
about you.

57:42.833 --> 57:44.600
And it's all lies too.

57:44.701 --> 57:47.603
- Somebody should stop him.
- Yes, we should do that.

57:47.704 --> 57:49.539
He probably hold a press conference,

57:49.640 --> 57:53.009
clear the air, let people know
what's really going on.

57:53.110 --> 57:56.078
I don't care about
what people think, okay?

57:56.179 --> 57:59.749
I've got nothing to prove.
I know who I am.

57:59.850 --> 58:01.350
Yeah, but...

58:01.451 --> 58:04.687
Champ, people might start to hate you.

58:04.788 --> 58:07.490
- That's bad for business.
- He's got a point.

58:07.591 --> 58:10.626
You're the one who always
tells me the truth

58:10.727 --> 58:13.095
- always comes out again.
- Yes, I said that.

58:13.196 --> 58:16.399
Okay so, why don't we focus on training?

58:16.500 --> 58:19.936
And we'll do the talking in the cage.

58:20.037 --> 58:24.538
- I like the sound of that.
- Ok, so let's train. Come on.

58:25.241 --> 58:27.677
So that Cage, you gotta remember,

58:27.778 --> 58:32.548
he's all muscle.
He's a wrecking machine.

58:32.649 --> 58:37.453
The only way you can beat him
is with speed,

58:37.554 --> 58:41.023
agility and combinations.

58:41.124 --> 58:42.491
That's what we got to focus on.

58:42.592 --> 58:44.961
So I stay out of his reach.

58:45.062 --> 58:47.496
Come and do the damage, and leave.

58:47.597 --> 58:49.165
Cause if he hits you one time,

58:50.534 --> 58:51.300
game over.

58:51.401 --> 58:53.469
Yeah, he's a monster.

58:53.570 --> 58:57.907
I'm not fighting the monster,
I'm fighting the man.

58:58.008 --> 59:01.177
I'm pretty sure he has a weakness.
We all do.

59:01.278 --> 59:05.279
- Well, find it. Hit it.
- Hold it.

59:20.279 --> 59:21.764
There we go.

59:21.865 --> 59:24.700
Come on, last two rounds.

59:24.801 --> 59:27.168
Nice. That a'boy.

59:27.503 --> 59:30.906
Yeah, last round! Come on!

59:31.007 --> 59:32.475
Come on, give me everything!

59:32.576 --> 59:35.144
- It's for the money.
- Give me everything!

59:35.245 --> 59:37.811
Put all there!

59:39.348 --> 59:42.051
- You got it!
- What a boy!

59:42.152 --> 59:44.920
Looking good.

59:45.021 --> 59:46.856
Alright, good done.

59:46.957 --> 59:48.858
- You're right?
- Yeah.

59:48.959 --> 59:52.962
Alright guys, I've got to go
see the wife and the kid.

59:53.063 --> 59:54.897
You deserve it.

59:54.998 --> 59:58.534
We're going to stay and watch
the video of Cage, alright?

59:58.635 --> 01:00:01.404
- And study him. Alright?
- Got it.

01:00:01.505 --> 01:00:03.637
Give them my love.

01:00:05.241 --> 01:00:09.610
You did good today, little brother.
You earned it.

01:00:12.581 --> 01:00:14.950
- It's looking good.
- It's looking good.

01:00:15.051 --> 01:00:16.686
Yeah, all good.

01:00:16.787 --> 01:00:19.355
How long have you guys been
working together, 8 years?

01:00:19.456 --> 01:00:20.956
Actually ten.

01:00:21.057 --> 01:00:22.658
I was exactly 17

01:00:22.759 --> 01:00:25.194
when your brother saved
my ass from a beat down.

01:00:25.295 --> 01:00:28.364
Oh, yeah? What was that about?

01:00:28.465 --> 01:00:33.434
Well, I bet on this mixed
martial arts fight at a bar...

01:00:33.936 --> 01:00:38.005
And I won, so I went
to collect my money.

01:00:38.808 --> 01:00:44.311
And the guy didn't want to pay.
So I started pushing him.

01:00:44.613 --> 01:00:47.049
And he didn't like that very much.

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:50.119
Next thing I know, I look behind me

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.355
and the whole bar's ready
to take me down.

01:00:52.456 --> 01:00:54.922
If it wasn't for Hector,

01:00:55.925 --> 01:00:58.761
I would have had my ass handed to me.

01:00:58.862 --> 01:01:00.828
I mean really.

01:01:01.864 --> 01:01:06.068
After that we started talking,
went out and drinking

01:01:06.169 --> 01:01:09.739
and teamed up and we've been
running together ever since.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.806
And you stopped betting, right?

01:01:15.244 --> 01:01:17.544
Actually, um...

01:01:20.282 --> 01:01:23.617
I might have a bit
of a gambling problem.

01:01:25.154 --> 01:01:27.456
But hey, you know, that's ten years.

01:01:27.557 --> 01:01:29.225
Ten years man, we made it!

01:01:29.326 --> 01:01:31.394
- We made it!
- That's more than 10 years.

01:01:31.495 --> 01:01:33.863
- It's more like 30.
- 30?

01:01:33.964 --> 01:01:38.534
Yes, our father started training us
when we were little boys.

01:01:38.635 --> 01:01:42.104
He was a Mexican kickboxing champ.

01:01:42.205 --> 01:01:45.741
And he worked with us. Hard.

01:01:45.842 --> 01:01:51.347
And then, when we were teenagers
he tried to bring us to the US and...

01:01:51.448 --> 01:01:54.349
something went down really bad.

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:56.950
We lost both our parents.

01:01:57.353 --> 01:01:59.655
We got sent back,

01:01:59.756 --> 01:02:03.490
we worked in the strawberry fields
picking strawberries.

01:02:04.894 --> 01:02:08.030
We met an old man, an old priest.

01:02:08.131 --> 01:02:11.133
He took us in, took care of us.

01:02:11.234 --> 01:02:14.001
Eventually, he passed away and...

01:02:15.671 --> 01:02:18.274
out of honor for him,

01:02:18.375 --> 01:02:20.342
I decided to become a priest.

01:02:20.443 --> 01:02:23.879
Man, that's a tough story, padre.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.982
Yeah, but that's not the worst of it.

01:02:27.083 --> 01:02:29.585
It gets worse?

01:02:29.686 --> 01:02:32.288
Yeah, it was really rough for us
when we were little.

01:02:32.389 --> 01:02:34.988
Our father was a drunk.

01:02:36.425 --> 01:02:41.430
And anytime he'd lose,

01:02:41.531 --> 01:02:43.065
he'd take it out on us.

01:02:47.369 --> 01:02:50.940
He would beat the hell out of all of us.

01:02:51.041 --> 01:02:52.973
My mom,

01:02:54.243 --> 01:02:57.544
Hector, and me.

01:02:58.414 --> 01:03:02.916
For some reason Hector
always took the worst beatings.

01:03:05.554 --> 01:03:07.688
He keeps fighting.

01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:10.391
A man like that...

01:03:11.327 --> 01:03:13.028
deserves success.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.669
Hi, I'm Gia Chavez.

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:57.039
I'm here for the interview
regarding my son's operation.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:59.909
Just wait a few minutes,
our social worker will be with you soon.

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:03.078
Just fill out these forms please.

01:04:03.179 --> 01:04:05.779
Okay, thank you.

01:04:29.839 --> 01:04:34.241
Hello? Yes, okay.
I'll send her right in.

01:04:35.144 --> 01:04:37.211
Chavez?

01:04:38.781 --> 01:04:41.016
Okay baby, I have to go.

01:04:41.117 --> 01:04:43.619
- No...
- I've got this horrible patient

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.221
- who's driving me crazy.
- What does he have?

01:04:46.322 --> 01:04:48.257
He just had an operation but

01:04:48.358 --> 01:04:51.627
he's so mean that everyone
in the hospital wants him to die.

01:04:51.728 --> 01:04:54.330
Why don't you just unplug him?

01:04:54.431 --> 01:04:59.969
All my life I've been trying to save people
and now I'm going to kill them?

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:03.971
- It was just an idea.
- Right.

01:05:23.225 --> 01:05:25.125
Oh, shit.

01:05:25.961 --> 01:05:28.197
You're very hard to find, my friend.

01:05:28.298 --> 01:05:30.399
Look, I just need more time.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.968
Sorry, time is up.

01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:35.237
Man look, I can get you your money.

01:05:39.142 --> 01:05:40.743
Oh, shit. Man...

01:05:40.844 --> 01:05:43.512
look I can get you your money,
I swear, my fighter!

01:05:43.613 --> 01:05:45.712
Wait a second.

01:05:46.582 --> 01:05:49.618
- Is this your fighter?
- Yeah.

01:05:49.719 --> 01:05:52.085
You know Hector Chavez?

01:05:55.124 --> 01:05:59.561
Yeah, he's my fighter,
I've been trying to tell you.

01:05:59.662 --> 01:06:01.163
He's going to win.

01:06:01.264 --> 01:06:06.769
From one Jew to another,
you are one lucky motherfucker.

01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:10.873
There's a way to make this work
for the good of all of us.

01:06:10.974 --> 01:06:13.640
You sure your guy's gonna win?

01:06:15.377 --> 01:06:17.312
You wanna bet?

01:06:31.026 --> 01:06:32.960
And, time!

01:06:33.228 --> 01:06:34.697
Good work.

01:06:34.798 --> 01:06:36.565
Looking good.

01:06:36.666 --> 01:06:39.234
I couldn't find anything on this Cage.

01:06:39.335 --> 01:06:40.803
I think I got something.

01:06:40.904 --> 01:06:43.172
You gotta let me do
a little more research.

01:06:43.273 --> 01:06:46.675
Take two minutes, go.
Not too much water.

01:06:46.776 --> 01:06:48.875
Okay bro.

01:06:49.678 --> 01:06:53.916
There you go, Champ.
Nice sprawl. Nice, nice!

01:07:09.298 --> 01:07:14.069
- What's happening, ese?
- I told you to leave us alone.

01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:18.907
The only way that's gonna happen
is if you fight my man here,

01:07:19.008 --> 01:07:20.743
- Little Juan.
- Look...

01:07:20.844 --> 01:07:23.312
- I don't want any trouble, ok?
- It's too late.

01:07:23.413 --> 01:07:25.879
You're already in trouble.

01:07:46.001 --> 01:07:49.403
- Stay down!
- No way, motherfucker!

01:07:55.744 --> 01:07:57.944
Yeah, Champ, yes!

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.850
Shoot that midget!

01:08:04.119 --> 01:08:05.986
Shoot him!

01:08:07.756 --> 01:08:09.956
Shit, you...

01:08:10.659 --> 01:08:12.893
Let's go. Juan, vete.

01:08:26.875 --> 01:08:31.078
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, what happened?

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.049
Mando and the other guys shot Ian.

01:08:36.885 --> 01:08:38.720
Is he going to be okay?

01:08:38.821 --> 01:08:40.389
We don't know.

01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:43.658
They're operating him right now,
we're waiting.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.361
- I have to go to Martin.
- Okay, baby.

01:08:46.462 --> 01:08:48.361
Go.

01:08:49.398 --> 01:08:53.535
You keep me posted, I just wanted
to come and visit Martin.

01:08:53.636 --> 01:08:55.770
And see you.

01:08:55.872 --> 01:08:59.041
Hector, I think I found a weakness.

01:08:59.142 --> 01:09:00.776
I've been watching the videos,

01:09:00.877 --> 01:09:03.145
and during one of his amateur fights

01:09:03.246 --> 01:09:07.683
he got hit hard on the left side
of the jaw, fractured it,

01:09:07.783 --> 01:09:09.184
that's his achilles heel.

01:09:09.285 --> 01:09:11.752
- Left side of the jaw?
- Yes.

01:09:11.853 --> 01:09:14.154
Got it, got it.

01:09:15.823 --> 01:09:18.225
I have to ask you something.

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.930
I wanted to ask you this
for a long time.

01:09:22.031 --> 01:09:24.264
We were little kids,

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:28.100
every time you got hit you got back up.

01:09:29.604 --> 01:09:31.206
Why?

01:09:31.307 --> 01:09:35.975
I always got up hoping that
the next time instead of hitting me,

01:09:36.144 --> 01:09:38.613
he would hug me, you know?

01:09:38.714 --> 01:09:40.515
But he never did.

01:09:40.616 --> 01:09:42.084
And I never stood up for you.

01:09:42.185 --> 01:09:43.785
It wasn't your fault.

01:09:43.886 --> 01:09:47.287
In all the commotion of our lives,

01:09:48.756 --> 01:09:51.424
I keep forgetting to tell you

01:09:52.761 --> 01:09:55.262
how much I admire you.

01:09:55.864 --> 01:09:59.399
And I love you and I always will.

01:10:02.404 --> 01:10:04.473
And I admire you.

01:10:04.574 --> 01:10:06.973
And I love you too, brother.

01:10:10.112 --> 01:10:12.546
We will get through this.

01:10:12.914 --> 01:10:15.182
We'll get through this.

01:10:17.019 --> 01:10:20.989
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:24.858
- I've got a lot of help.
- I know.

01:10:36.973 --> 01:10:39.072
Mrs. Chavez.

01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:43.712
We got the results we were looking for,

01:10:43.813 --> 01:10:48.048
he's strong and ready for surgery
this Friday, May 5th.

01:10:48.316 --> 01:10:50.886
I don't know how to tell you this but,

01:10:50.987 --> 01:10:53.121
I don't know how
we are going to pay for it.

01:10:53.222 --> 01:10:54.823
It's all taken care of.

01:10:54.924 --> 01:10:56.992
Your husband made the $25,000 deposit

01:10:57.093 --> 01:10:59.960
and took care of the payments.

01:11:01.463 --> 01:11:03.396
Thank you.

01:11:08.236 --> 01:11:12.272
You lose. Strip down, homie.

01:11:17.512 --> 01:11:22.415
When I was five years old
I was on the streets.

01:11:23.151 --> 01:11:28.989
No mother, no father, by myself.

01:11:32.661 --> 01:11:37.230
I could have either been
a little street bumbane,

01:11:38.467 --> 01:11:40.567
or a king.

01:11:41.103 --> 01:11:44.104
I started putting all this together.

01:11:44.739 --> 01:11:47.274
I became el rey.

01:11:48.777 --> 01:11:51.248
I need a queen.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.850
I want you to be my queen.

01:11:54.951 --> 01:11:57.052
I don't know if I can.

01:11:57.153 --> 01:11:58.987
Yeah, I know you can.

01:11:59.088 --> 01:12:00.956
- You gotta show me.
- I'll show you.

01:12:03.526 --> 01:12:05.627
Over and over.

01:12:05.728 --> 01:12:09.229
Yeah, and every day.

01:12:10.132 --> 01:12:14.567
Get these fucking people
out of here, now!

01:12:15.837 --> 01:12:18.773
Everybody, get out of here!

01:12:18.874 --> 01:12:20.574
Let's go!

01:12:24.045 --> 01:12:26.146
Who is it?

01:12:26.515 --> 01:12:29.418
- Who is it?
- It's Jose, the priest.

01:12:29.519 --> 01:12:33.386
- It's the fucking priest.
- Let him in.

01:12:36.324 --> 01:12:38.659
Are you lost, priest?

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.994
Hello, Mando.

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:43.932
I come here in peace.

01:12:44.033 --> 01:12:47.133
I just have a special request.

01:12:47.802 --> 01:12:49.337
You leave my brother alone.

01:12:49.438 --> 01:12:51.807
He's an example in the community
and a good man.

01:12:51.908 --> 01:12:54.341
He almost killed my guy.

01:12:54.676 --> 01:12:57.846
I'm sure he was protecting himself.

01:12:57.947 --> 01:13:00.881
He wouldn't harm anybody for nothing.

01:13:00.982 --> 01:13:04.186
Please, consider my request.

01:13:04.287 --> 01:13:06.455
I'll consider under one condition.

01:13:06.556 --> 01:13:08.455
Whatever.

01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:11.257
You really beg.

01:13:15.363 --> 01:13:18.999
Okay Mando, I'm begging you.

01:13:23.506 --> 01:13:28.074
That's not how you beg, priest. Now beg!

01:13:30.445 --> 01:13:32.345
Mando...

01:13:36.485 --> 01:13:38.385
Please...

01:13:44.826 --> 01:13:48.194
Mando, I came here in peace.

01:13:52.668 --> 01:13:54.769
Juanito!

01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:58.505
Got any forgiveness in your heart
for this priest?

01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:02.275
- Naw.
- Please Mando.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.187
I love you, little brother.

01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:18.658
Get this priest off my carpet,
he's bleeding all over it.

01:14:42.717 --> 01:14:46.621
I guess May 5th is a big day
for the Chavez's, huh?

01:14:46.722 --> 01:14:48.721
I guess so.

01:14:50.792 --> 01:14:52.725
Are you okay?

01:14:53.161 --> 01:14:55.130
All my life...

01:14:55.231 --> 01:14:58.364
I was hoping for a chance
to prove that...

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.435
I'm a winner and I'm worthy.

01:15:04.139 --> 01:15:06.539
And now that time is here.

01:15:09.344 --> 01:15:13.246
- I'm afraid.
- Afraid of what?

01:15:14.849 --> 01:15:17.150
Afraid of losing.

01:15:18.586 --> 01:15:21.387
Afraid of not being worth it.

01:15:22.223 --> 01:15:24.626
Maybe I'm just a regular nobody
and that's that.

01:15:24.727 --> 01:15:28.363
Hector, you're already a winner.

01:15:28.464 --> 01:15:31.866
You're a great father,

01:15:31.967 --> 01:15:34.234
a great husband.

01:15:35.704 --> 01:15:38.406
You know, I'll never forget
what you said to me

01:15:38.507 --> 01:15:41.308
when we first met, do you remember?

01:15:41.409 --> 01:15:43.245
You said, "Everyday

01:15:43.346 --> 01:15:46.281
when you wake up and go out there,
do your very best,

01:15:46.382 --> 01:15:49.584
so at the end of the day
we'd have no regrets.

01:15:49.685 --> 01:15:54.287
So that way when you go to bed
at night you'd have no regrets."

01:15:54.656 --> 01:15:56.992
You don't need to win that fight today,

01:15:57.093 --> 01:16:01.630
you just need to do your best
and give it all you've got.

01:16:01.731 --> 01:16:05.233
Martin and I will be here
waiting for you.

01:16:05.334 --> 01:16:08.535
I've known all my life
that you're a winner.

01:16:09.537 --> 01:16:12.939
Today, the whole world's going to know.

01:16:13.508 --> 01:16:15.810
You're pretty and strong too, huh?

01:16:15.911 --> 01:16:18.845
I learned from the best.

01:16:26.154 --> 01:16:31.059
- Finally hit the big time, huh?
- About freaking time, baby.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.861
You can text me and let me know
how Martin's doing.

01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:38.033
And you should check on Ian, too.

01:16:38.134 --> 01:16:40.466
I have to get going.

01:16:40.735 --> 01:16:45.505
Thank you for everything. Thank you.

01:16:48.676 --> 01:16:50.543
Go.

01:16:52.614 --> 01:16:55.517
- Are you Mr. Hector Chavez?
- Yes.

01:16:55.618 --> 01:16:57.886
Mr. Chavez, I have some bad news.

01:16:57.987 --> 01:17:01.456
I'm sorry to say, but your brother
was found dead today.

01:17:42.331 --> 01:17:45.467
I came to wish you luck,
Mr. Hector Chavez.

01:17:45.568 --> 01:17:47.001
Thank you, sir.

01:17:47.102 --> 01:17:48.737
Remember what King Author said,

01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:51.806
"Rise up, defend the innocent,
might for right."

01:17:51.907 --> 01:17:53.808
You're a symbol to your people, an icon.

01:17:53.909 --> 01:17:56.878
Just as I am a river
economically to my people.

01:17:56.979 --> 01:18:02.348
So defend your people,
rise up on Cinco de Mayo!

01:18:02.684 --> 01:18:04.886
I don't see your coterie of staff...

01:18:04.987 --> 01:18:06.886
Here!

01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:12.627
That's an odd choice
for a support system, Mr. Chavez.

01:18:12.728 --> 01:18:15.864
- Onward and upward, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:15.965 --> 01:18:18.500
- Where's Ian?
- Maybe he won't make it,

01:18:18.601 --> 01:18:20.201
he suffered a cardiac arrest.

01:18:20.302 --> 01:18:24.904
He's in intensive care
and his prognosis is very poor.

01:18:26.674 --> 01:18:28.843
- I'm sorry.
- I spoke briefly with him,

01:18:28.944 --> 01:18:34.115
he was very weak but he asked me
to tend your corner for him.

01:18:34.216 --> 01:18:37.352
- It's not a good idea.
- Please!

01:18:37.453 --> 01:18:40.853
It's time, let's go, Chavez.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.427
Okay.

01:19:12.754 --> 01:19:17.325
And now for the city of angels
in Los Angeles, California,

01:19:17.426 --> 01:19:20.695
this is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

01:19:20.796 --> 01:19:23.164
The main event for the evening,

01:19:23.265 --> 01:19:26.901
5 rounds scheduled
for the Ultimate Extreme Combat

01:19:27.002 --> 01:19:30.138
Heavy Weight Championship of the World!

01:19:30.239 --> 01:19:34.209
Introducing the challenger fighting
in the red corner.

01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:37.445
Standing 5 feet 11 inches tall,
he weighed in officially

01:19:37.546 --> 01:19:39.647
at 223 pounds.

01:19:39.748 --> 01:19:42.417
As a professional,
he enters the cage perfect,

01:19:42.518 --> 01:19:45.487
18 victories and no defeats

01:19:45.588 --> 01:19:49.190
fighting out of Tijuana,
Baja, California, Mexico.

01:19:49.291 --> 01:19:52.193
Here is the undefeated Challenger,

01:19:52.294 --> 01:19:57.830
Hector the Mexican Chavez!

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.869
And next his opponent across the cage

01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:04.472
fighting out of the blue corner.
At 6 feet 5 inches tall,

01:20:04.573 --> 01:20:08.343
this heavy weight
weighed in at 279 pounds.

01:20:08.444 --> 01:20:11.779
From Austin Texas, here is the reigning,

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:16.584
defending UXC Heavy Weight
Champion of the World,

01:20:16.685 --> 01:20:23.790
the undefeated Cage the Destroyer Fury!

01:20:24.626 --> 01:20:28.930
Referee in charge
of the action, Mike Beltra.

01:20:29.031 --> 01:20:31.097
Let's bring it in.

01:20:32.634 --> 01:20:34.369
You know the rules already.

01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:38.139
Protect yourself at all times,
obey my commands at all times.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.341
Touch gloves now if you want.

01:20:40.442 --> 01:20:42.243
Very well, all the way back.

01:20:42.344 --> 01:20:45.713
At the sound of the bell,
come on out and handle your business.

01:20:45.814 --> 01:20:49.015
You ready to fight? Handle, let's go!

01:20:59.661 --> 01:21:02.230
Beautiful, exquisite moves
by the Challenger.

01:21:02.331 --> 01:21:03.798
His strategy seems to be

01:21:03.899 --> 01:21:06.434
to evade, evacuate, shock,
awe, and keep distance.

01:21:06.535 --> 01:21:09.535
Well, I do not blame him for that.

01:21:15.843 --> 01:21:18.110
Take him out, Champ!

01:21:33.529 --> 01:21:36.062
Ow, we are down to the crunch.

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:43.504
I'm okay.

01:21:43.605 --> 01:21:45.039
What the hell are you doing?

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:47.542
You're supposed to take him out
a long time ago.

01:21:47.643 --> 01:21:49.644
If he hits you again just stay down.

01:21:49.745 --> 01:21:52.146
You may really go wrong
with this maniac.

01:21:52.247 --> 01:21:53.481
- I can't.
- Why?!

01:21:53.582 --> 01:21:55.917
You already made the money!

01:21:56.018 --> 01:21:57.785
I told my kid I'm going to do my best.

01:21:57.886 --> 01:21:59.420
Oh, come on, Hector!

01:21:59.521 --> 01:22:02.890
- Just stay out.
- Finish him!

01:22:02.991 --> 01:22:04.626
Fine!

01:22:37.258 --> 01:22:39.360
He's fighting the Champ.

01:22:43.898 --> 01:22:46.999
<i>God, Chavez is still standing!</i>

01:22:49.337 --> 01:22:51.739
Oh, my God, oh my God, Hector.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.640
It's just a cut, it's okay.

01:22:55.576 --> 01:22:59.946
I'm okay, I'm okay.
You can fix it, come on.

01:23:01.616 --> 01:23:05.186
Chavez! Chavez! Chavez!

01:23:05.287 --> 01:23:09.589
Oh, my God, the building
seems like its about to lift off!

01:23:15.329 --> 01:23:18.864
The Champ seems not to be holding!

01:23:46.694 --> 01:23:48.794
Yes!

01:23:57.972 --> 01:24:00.475
You got him, now finish him off!

01:24:00.576 --> 01:24:03.209
Get up Chavez, let's finish this!

01:24:25.701 --> 01:24:28.167
Thank you, God.

01:24:32.874 --> 01:24:35.042
Just stay down.

01:24:35.143 --> 01:24:38.678
Just stay down. The fight is over.

01:24:39.146 --> 01:24:40.181
No.

01:24:40.282 --> 01:24:41.916
Why? You already proved your point,

01:24:42.017 --> 01:24:45.317
you already made your money,
just give it up.

01:24:45.686 --> 01:24:47.021
I can't.

01:24:47.122 --> 01:24:49.423
We were supposed
to be winning this fight.

01:24:49.524 --> 01:24:51.526
Our reputation is at stake.

01:24:51.627 --> 01:24:52.960
Back off, Stone.

01:24:53.061 --> 01:24:56.364
When I get done with you, you won't
be able to manage shoe shine boys.

01:24:56.465 --> 01:24:59.734
You can get in here
and blind him with your suit.

01:24:59.835 --> 01:25:02.670
I can't see out of my right eye,

01:25:02.771 --> 01:25:05.039
the official is coming.
Put your hand on my back

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:07.275
and tell me how many fingers
he holds up.

01:25:07.376 --> 01:25:09.677
- What?
- Just do it.

01:25:09.778 --> 01:25:11.579
I'm okay, don't stop the fight.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.481
Okay.

01:25:13.582 --> 01:25:15.783
How many fingers am I holding up?

01:25:15.884 --> 01:25:18.050
Three, three.

01:25:18.719 --> 01:25:21.487
- And how about now?
- One.

01:25:21.956 --> 01:25:24.392
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:25:28.096 --> 01:25:31.430
Chavez is really making him
work for this one.

01:25:59.894 --> 01:26:02.128
What the hell?!

01:26:25.152 --> 01:26:28.387
Doctor, his vitals are weakening.

01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:31.726
It's way past bradycardia.

01:26:31.827 --> 01:26:34.927
Damn, come on kid, fight for it.

01:26:37.631 --> 01:26:41.867
Give him atropine,
full milligram, intravenous.

01:26:44.905 --> 01:26:47.306
<i>I love you, daddy.</i>

01:26:48.242 --> 01:26:52.713
It's a miracle,
his vitals are coming back.

01:26:52.814 --> 01:26:54.881
Thank God.

01:26:54.982 --> 01:26:57.550
<i>Left side of his jaw.</i>

01:26:58.686 --> 01:27:01.520
Get up, get up!

01:27:07.028 --> 01:27:09.328
Stop, he's out.

01:27:15.537 --> 01:27:21.173
Get down now! Get on the ground!
Get down! Get down!

01:27:46.801 --> 01:27:50.672
- Great fight, Chavez, congratulations.
- Thank you, Champ.

01:27:50.773 --> 01:27:52.231
Now you're gonna know
what it's like to have something

01:27:52.332 --> 01:27:54.573
everyone's willing to kill you for.

01:27:56.043 --> 01:27:59.879
Take care of that belt for me,
I'll be back for it.

01:28:01.248 --> 01:28:05.252
Ladies and gentlemen, the end comes
4 minutes 59 seconds,

01:28:05.353 --> 01:28:08.923
round number 5,
your winner by KO victory

01:28:09.024 --> 01:28:13.794
and new UXC heavy weight
champion of the world,

01:28:13.895 --> 01:28:18.899
Hector the Mexican Chavez!

01:28:22.971 --> 01:28:24.672
Where is he, where's Chavez?

01:28:24.773 --> 01:28:26.240
He is with his family.

01:28:26.341 --> 01:28:29.441
He says you can shove
the belt up your ass.

01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:37.283
Hurry.

01:28:38.752 --> 01:28:40.388
You okay?

01:28:42.791 --> 01:28:45.391
- I'm okay.
- You sure?

01:28:47.695 --> 01:28:49.797
Thank you.

01:29:00.941 --> 01:29:05.244
Thank you for listening to my prayers
about Hector and Martin.

01:29:07.047 --> 01:29:08.983
See?

01:29:09.084 --> 01:29:11.951
That's why I love you so much.

01:29:13.454 --> 01:29:15.222
Because you always give yourself

01:29:15.323 --> 01:29:18.459
unconditionally to everybody else.

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:21.493
And because you're too damn pretty.

01:29:22.596 --> 01:29:23.964
Look at your face.

01:29:24.065 --> 01:29:26.000
It's getting prettier by the minute.

01:29:26.101 --> 01:29:28.300
Yes it is.

01:29:30.604 --> 01:29:32.106
How is he?

01:29:32.207 --> 01:29:34.975
The operation was a success.

01:29:35.076 --> 01:29:37.543
He's going to be all better.

01:29:51.092 --> 01:29:54.395
I realized my brother has given his life

01:29:54.496 --> 01:29:57.529
for our freedom and happiness.

01:29:58.265 --> 01:30:01.235
And that to conquer great dreams,

01:30:01.336 --> 01:30:05.170
great sacrifices must be made.

01:30:05.506 --> 01:30:09.441
Jose will live in our hearts forever.

01:30:09.543 --> 01:30:12.980
And I know that my brother...

01:30:13.081 --> 01:30:17.149
stood up for me still the end.
