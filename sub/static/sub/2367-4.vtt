00:39.748 --> 00:41.166
[Vladimir speaking Russian]
Where's Oleg?

00:42.375 --> 00:44.086
It's just us now.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.798
[Vladimir]
We don't need anyone else.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.633
[Anatoly groaning]

00:54.471 --> 00:55.639
[sighs]

00:55.723 --> 00:57.933
Only each other.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.434
[breathing heavily]

01:05.023 --> 01:07.818
Soon it'll just be you, Vladimir.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.864
No, my brother.

01:11.947 --> 01:15.075
We leave here together.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.578
Tonight.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.082
Where did you get this?

01:24.251 --> 01:25.252
A gift...

01:26.169 --> 01:27.170
from Alexei.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.886
The guards shouldn't have
left him for the rats.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.392
Will we see Moscow?

01:40.475 --> 01:41.769
Moscow?

01:43.812 --> 01:45.939
It's a city buried in the past.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.608
[flesh squishing]

01:47.691 --> 01:49.652
We must look to...

01:49.735 --> 01:51.153
the future.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.613
America.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.156
Where we will rule...

01:54.239 --> 01:55.949
as kings.

01:57.701 --> 01:58.702
-[bone cracking]
-[grunts]

02:07.711 --> 02:09.504
[speaking Russian]
He's here!

02:09.587 --> 02:11.464
Who do you think?

02:11.548 --> 02:13.634
No, I don't know how he found us.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.428
Where's my brother?

02:16.511 --> 02:18.346
Listen, shut up!

02:18.430 --> 02:20.265
Shut up!
I don't care what he told you...

02:20.348 --> 02:22.017
get him on the phone!

02:22.100 --> 02:23.560
[siren wailing]

02:43.330 --> 02:45.332
[theme music playing]

03:46.434 --> 03:48.228
[Claire] You've been busy.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.897
Yeah. Ow.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.148
Sorry.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.485
So, how's that working out for you?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.031
You should see the other guys.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.448
I have.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.411
The one you threw off the roof,
at my place?

04:04.494 --> 04:07.372
He's in a coma. Do you know that?

04:07.455 --> 04:09.207
Yeah, I heard.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.544
How do you feel about that?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.547
I'll live.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.925
-[clattering]
-Hey! [hisses]

04:18.008 --> 04:19.885
-Get off the counter!
-[meows]

04:21.386 --> 04:23.013
[chuckling]
Wow, you don't like cats.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.307
[chuckling] I'm allergic.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.977
I was supposed to be coming in,
feeding this guy twice a day

04:29.061 --> 04:31.604
while my friend was out of town,

04:31.688 --> 04:33.941
not hiding out here
using up all my sick days.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.067
Just a while longer.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.569
Just till I know
the Russians aren't looking for you.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.531
I'm not the one that looks like
they've been through the grinder.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.034
You really need to get
some kind of body armor or something.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.828
It would slow me down too much.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.038
So will a bullet.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.915
You worried about me?

04:51.416 --> 04:52.960
What if I were?

04:53.836 --> 04:57.505
I would tell you I'm a big boy,
and not to be.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.675
Right.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.428
That's why you keep ending up here.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.931
Well, maybe I just like
the sound of your voice.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.099
Hmm.

05:08.809 --> 05:12.312
So what happens the night you come by...

05:12.395 --> 05:14.314
I'm already talking to someone else?

05:14.397 --> 05:17.775
-Yeah, [clears throat] it crossed my mind.
-Yeah?

05:21.529 --> 05:22.990
Here. [sighs]

05:23.866 --> 05:26.743
Um, you shouldn't have.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.579
[Matt chuckles]

05:29.662 --> 05:32.082
I didn't. The burner's for me.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.126
Memorize the number, put yours in.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.378
Next time I need to come by, I'll call.

05:39.381 --> 05:43.551
By "come by," do you mean stumble in,
bleeding half to death?

05:43.635 --> 05:45.678
Yeah, something like that.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.392
You're gonna get yourself killed.
You really gotta ease up.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.435
No, I can't.
[grunts] Not yet.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.522
I can take care of myself, Mike.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.315
-You know--
-It's not just about you.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.696
It's a little more complicated than that.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.658
You ever heard the name Wilson Fisk?

06:06.741 --> 06:09.912
No... who's that?

06:11.704 --> 06:13.290
Just a name somebody gave me.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.793
But there's no public record.

06:16.876 --> 06:20.380
Nothing on the Internet.
Not one mention of Fisk.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.757
Maybe whoever gave you his name was lying.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.093
I would have known if he was.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.344
How?

06:27.345 --> 06:29.389
Heartbeat.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.850
Right, of course, heartbeat.

06:33.518 --> 06:37.730
So, what, you're just gonna go out there
punching whoever you can,

06:37.814 --> 06:41.484
hoping to find somebody
who knows this Fisk guy?

06:41.568 --> 06:44.988
Well, apply enough pressure,
someone will break.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.239
Sooner or later.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.713
[chatting indistinctly]

07:09.221 --> 07:13.225
-Oof. Those look like they hurt.
-I've had worse.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.018
I know how much your people delight

07:15.102 --> 07:17.270
in extolling the amount of pain
they can endure,

07:17.354 --> 07:19.689
but maybe next time you could try ducking?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.651
Leland's finalized the paperwork.

07:23.735 --> 07:27.197
Prohaszka's holdings in Kitchen Cab
have been acquired

07:27.280 --> 07:30.325
and transferred via third party
to Veles Taxi.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.204
Your distribution infrastructure
just doubled.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.165
Tell your employer we are grateful.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.919
Don't think he really cares at the moment.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.672
You were light again this week.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.508
There was a complication.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.301
One you assured us you were addressing.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.971
Do you know what he was asking?

07:51.054 --> 07:53.098
This fool who laid hands on my brother?

07:53.181 --> 07:55.142
-Not my concern.
-[Anatoly] It should be.

07:55.225 --> 07:58.770
He was asking about your employer,
by name.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.233
All the more reason to settle this.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.028
You sneeze, we all catch a cold.

08:06.819 --> 08:10.948
Madame Gao and Mr. Nobu
have expressed their disappointment.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.450
We have not heard of this.

08:12.534 --> 08:16.204
Hmm, that's because we've been
talking behind your back,

08:16.288 --> 08:21.376
about how the Russians can't seem to
handle one man running around in a mask.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.587
I mean, if he had an iron suit
or a magic hammer,

08:24.671 --> 08:26.006
maybe that would explain

08:26.089 --> 08:27.632
why you keep getting
your asses handed to you--

08:27.715 --> 08:29.467
We're done here.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.762
He's weakened your operation.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.765
You think us weak?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.435
This isn't personal, Vladimir.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.686
It's business.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.939
Distribution of Madame Gao's product
has been affected,

08:43.023 --> 08:46.359
which in turn is causing delays
in other ventures.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.445
This is not acceptable.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.530
Fortunately for all parties,

08:50.613 --> 08:54.284
my employer has agreed
to help return you to solid footing.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.660
How?

08:55.743 --> 08:59.622
By aiding you in certain duties deemed
vital to the continuation of service--

08:59.706 --> 09:02.209
He wants to take over.

09:02.292 --> 09:08.131
We value the services you provide,
but clearly you need help providing them.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.258
We'll all profit nicely
under the new structure.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.510
-How nicely?
-[speaking Russian]

09:12.594 --> 09:15.805
-Tell Mr. Fisk--
-We don't say his name.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.143
Tell... Mr. Fisk...

09:21.186 --> 09:23.688
that if he wants a pound of flesh...

09:24.314 --> 09:26.816
he can come here
and carve it himself.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.700
This is an offer, not an order.

09:35.783 --> 09:39.204
The choice of how we proceed is yours.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.290
Talk it over with your brother.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.876
We'll be in touch.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.385
[speaking Russian]
Prissy little bitch.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.053
Reach out to Piotr.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.139
Why?

09:57.222 --> 09:58.848
Why do you think?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.268
If Wesley's employer finds out--

10:01.351 --> 10:03.936
His "employer"?

10:04.020 --> 10:06.063
Do you know why Fisk...

10:06.148 --> 10:08.566
doesn't want anyone saying his name?

10:09.484 --> 10:10.652
Hmm?

10:10.735 --> 10:13.821
Because it would betray
that he's just a man.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.116
So's the guy in the mask...

10:17.534 --> 10:20.162
and look what he's done to us.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.456
Yeah.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.544
What do we know about him?

10:27.627 --> 10:28.670
Nothing.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.590
Semyon might have found something...

10:32.674 --> 10:34.676
but he sleeps like the dead.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.512
Jesus rose on the third day...

10:39.472 --> 10:41.641
Semyon has slept long enough.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.317
[Karen] Did you look at it?

10:52.068 --> 10:53.820
[Ben] Yeah, I looked at it.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.072
[Karen] And?

10:56.156 --> 10:57.365
And...

10:58.283 --> 11:00.160
it's a story I've heard before.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.870
Company gets caught up in a scandal,
files for bankruptcy,

11:02.954 --> 11:04.747
then quietly restructures
under a new name.

11:04.831 --> 11:08.710
They killed Daniel Fisher.
They tried to kill me.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.003
I'm still a little unclear on that point.

11:12.088 --> 11:15.258
You say here Rance assaulted you
in your apartment.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.678
And a man in a black mask saved your life?

11:19.804 --> 11:22.599
Yes, but he just--
He came out of nowhere.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.101
-And you'd never seen him before?
-No.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.272
-Stranger things, right?
-[sighs]

11:29.356 --> 11:30.815
[Karen] Well, what about Rance?

11:30.898 --> 11:34.402
Do you really believe
that he just up and hung himself in jail?

11:34.486 --> 11:37.154
That guard tried to do
the same thing to me.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.281
Why don't you ask him?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.866
Farnum?

11:39.949 --> 11:41.075
He's dead.

11:41.158 --> 11:44.036
Ate the barrel of his gun in his basement.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.455
And your old boss, McClintock?

11:46.163 --> 11:48.500
Overdosed on pills or some such.

11:50.001 --> 11:52.504
You seeing a pattern here, Miss Page?

11:53.505 --> 11:56.215
Then why isn't anyone looking into this?

11:58.885 --> 12:01.220
You don't understand how lucky you are.

12:02.305 --> 12:06.100
Count the angels on the head of a pin,
and move on.

12:07.644 --> 12:11.147
So they just shuffle some papers
and all this disappears?

12:11.230 --> 12:13.691
-Wouldn't be the first time.
-Oh, don't bullshit me.

12:14.442 --> 12:19.113
A construction company
is brick and mortar, literally.

12:19.196 --> 12:23.785
All right, you cannot just shift
cranes and trailers and office equipment

12:23.868 --> 12:26.621
like you can numbers on a page.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.333
There has to be a trail
if everything is being liquidated.

12:32.669 --> 12:33.836
[exhales]

12:36.298 --> 12:37.590
Thanks for the coffee.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.677
[Karen] What?

12:41.928 --> 12:43.388
So that's it?

12:44.306 --> 12:48.184
Stories like this
are built on sources, Miss Page.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.144
Credible sources.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.524
I did some digging into your, uh...

12:56.275 --> 12:58.277
past activities.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.533
Well, I did some digging, too.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.119
I read every big story with your byline.

13:07.203 --> 13:12.625
The VA kickbacks, toxic runoff,
the Teachers Union scandal.

13:12.709 --> 13:16.212
Hell, you pretty much
brought down the Italian mob

13:16.295 --> 13:18.381
back when I was in diapers.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.094
What ever happened to that reporter,
Mr. Urich?

13:29.684 --> 13:31.060
He got old.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.731
And a hell of a lot less stupid.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.988
[monitor beeping]

13:52.624 --> 13:53.750
[door opening]

14:05.595 --> 14:06.596
[Anatoly speaking Russian]
My God.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.432
Give me the kit.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.856
[Anatoly] This could kill him.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.569
[Vladimir] Semyon's usually the one
we send for this sort of work.

14:21.653 --> 14:22.695
[beeping]

14:22.779 --> 14:24.781
He'd understand.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.578
[objects rattling]

14:31.245 --> 14:32.955
You hear back from Piotr?

14:33.039 --> 14:35.500
[Anatoly] Said he'd call
when he had something on Fisk's movements.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.878
Fisk is cautious.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.087
If he suspects--

14:40.171 --> 14:41.338
Then what?

14:42.256 --> 14:44.426
What are you so afraid of?

14:45.677 --> 14:49.221
We were in that hellhole for three years.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.058
From princes of Moscow...

14:52.141 --> 14:53.560
to shitting in a bucket.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.772
I promised myself if we ever got free...

14:57.855 --> 15:00.066
we'd never lose what we had again.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.484
Especially not to pride.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.905
Back when we had nothing,

15:05.988 --> 15:07.740
we agreed on everything.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.366
[Anatoly sighs]

15:09.451 --> 15:11.453
We've lost our way...

15:11.536 --> 15:13.329
in this land of riches.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.709
Then let's find it again...

15:17.792 --> 15:19.419
together.

15:19.502 --> 15:20.712
[sighs]

15:38.896 --> 15:40.231
You sure...

15:40.314 --> 15:42.358
this was epinephrine?

15:43.860 --> 15:44.861
[gasps]

15:46.988 --> 15:48.823
Get his tube out.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.243
[gurgling]

15:55.371 --> 15:57.248
[wheezing]

15:57.331 --> 15:59.000
Semyon...

15:59.083 --> 16:00.292
It's us...

16:00.376 --> 16:01.794
Anatoly and Vladimir.

16:02.712 --> 16:03.963
That's it...

16:04.839 --> 16:06.215
Breathe...

16:06.298 --> 16:07.884
Breathe...

16:09.802 --> 16:12.054
And tell us about the man
who did this to you.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.348
The devil.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.643
The devil.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.354
Did you see anything?

16:20.437 --> 16:21.481
Semyon?

16:21.564 --> 16:24.066
Anything that could help us find him?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.194
There was a woman...

16:30.322 --> 16:31.949
[whispering indistinctly]

16:38.122 --> 16:39.707
Get Sergei on the phone.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.651
Hola.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.278
Hola.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.286
[Wesley]
Anatoly may be the way in.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.497
He seems more amenable to the proposition,

17:20.582 --> 17:25.502
or at least not quite as...
vitriolic as his brother.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.214
Well, confrontations can be expensive.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.843
I'd prefer to handle this quietly.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.221
How are we on the timeline?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.850
Within a reasonable margin.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.352
Assuming we can settle
with the Russians quickly.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.771
We will. One way or another.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.941
What about the masked idiot?

17:48.943 --> 17:50.277
[sighs]

17:51.445 --> 17:55.742
If the brothers can't handle him,
I'll find another solution.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.003
No.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.883
You stay with the car.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.801
Sir...

18:13.885 --> 18:16.470
I need to attend to this alone.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.934
Thank you, Wesley.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.602
Well, hello there.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.021
-Hello.
-[chuckles]

19:07.772 --> 19:10.775
How are you enjoying
"rabbit in a snowstorm"?

19:11.818 --> 19:13.069
You remember.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.656
Of course...
It's one of my favorite pieces.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.950
I hung it in my bedroom.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.995
It's the last thing I see every night.

19:24.621 --> 19:28.876
That's either very romantic or very sad.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.545
-I like to tell myself it's the former.
-[chuckling]

19:31.628 --> 19:33.673
Don't we all?

19:33.756 --> 19:35.132
I wanted...

19:36.968 --> 19:40.387
I wanted to thank you for it...
personally.

19:41.764 --> 19:45.392
That's really not necessary,
but you're welcome.

19:45.476 --> 19:46.936
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

19:47.019 --> 19:48.437
No, I...

19:51.273 --> 19:55.695
Yes, I was actually wondering
if you cared to join me for dinner.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.989
I'm the only one working here tonight.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.407
That's okay.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.203
-Another time then.
-Mmm-hmm.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.873
That's it?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.125
[woman chuckles]

20:09.208 --> 20:11.794
You're not gonna offer
to buy every painting in here

20:11.878 --> 20:13.420
so I can close up early?

20:13.504 --> 20:15.715
A guy actually tried that once.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.225
A woman that can be bought...

20:26.809 --> 20:29.020
isn't worth having.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.405
I'm partial to Italian.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.617
-We agree on more than art.
-[laughs]

20:47.413 --> 20:48.539
Vanessa.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.585
[stutters] Wilson.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.512
[Claire blowing nose]

21:07.433 --> 21:08.935
[meows]

21:09.726 --> 21:11.145
[sniffs]

21:11.228 --> 21:12.271
[sighs]

21:13.522 --> 21:15.607
Eat it, you little bastard.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.739
[scraping]

21:23.574 --> 21:25.076
[rattling]

21:51.727 --> 21:53.395
[chuckles]

22:02.404 --> 22:04.365
[Foggy] My mom wanted me to be a butcher,
you know that?

22:04.448 --> 22:05.699
[Matt] Oh, not the butcher story.

22:05.782 --> 22:09.036
I said, "No, Mom, I want to be a lawyer."
I don't remember what I said next.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.621
No, you never do.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.582
But I'm fairly certain it wasn't about
bailing out a piss-drunk electrician

22:13.665 --> 22:14.708
who nearly burned his house down.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.127
Let's cross.

22:16.210 --> 22:19.088
Ed's wife left him, Foggy.
It was an accident.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.674
Admittedly involving
cigarettes and gasoline, but still.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.844
I could be carving my own corned beef.

22:24.927 --> 22:28.180
Making my own pickles,
have a little shop of my own.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.933
-You got your own office.
-We have office space.

22:31.017 --> 22:35.396
An actual office would involve
plantery and equipment,

22:35.479 --> 22:38.732
fax machines or
whatever successful people use.

22:38.815 --> 22:41.777
[chuckles] I don't think they use
fax machines anymore.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.072
How would I know?
Which is endemic to the problem.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.867
Matt, what if we're doing this all wrong?

22:48.951 --> 22:50.661
What if Landman and Zack
was the way to go?

22:50.744 --> 22:52.704
You hated interning there.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.373
I hate being broke.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.126
You think Landman and Zack
would have helped out Ed?

22:57.209 --> 22:58.710
No.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.755
But they had free bagels...
every morning.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.716
And they had furniture that
didn't smell like a pack of cigarettes.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.094
And elevators...
God, I miss the elevators.

23:07.178 --> 23:09.305
-We're doing good here, Foggy.
-Are we?

23:09.388 --> 23:10.722
Yeah, we're making a difference.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.058
[cell phone ringing]

23:14.768 --> 23:16.270
You get a new phone? We afford that?

23:17.146 --> 23:19.273
Hey, one sec.
Foggy, I'll see you tomorrow.

23:19.356 --> 23:22.193
It's a girl, isn't it?
You got a new phone just for your girls.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.486
-My life sucks.
-Get home safe.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.323
Hey, what's up?

23:27.406 --> 23:29.908
-[grunting]
-Claire?

23:29.992 --> 23:30.993
Claire, can you hear me?

23:31.077 --> 23:32.078
-Claire!
-[Claire screams]

23:48.760 --> 23:50.304
[breathing heavily]

23:51.055 --> 23:52.264
Claire.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.115
-[siren wailing]
-[overlapping voices]

24:20.459 --> 24:22.003
[man speaking Russian]

24:27.883 --> 24:29.301
[men conversing in Russian]

24:33.764 --> 24:34.806
[Claire exclaiming]

24:40.271 --> 24:42.189
[man speaking Russian]
Yeah, we have the woman.

24:42.273 --> 24:44.066
We're taking her there now.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.152
[muffled screaming]

25:07.464 --> 25:10.301
...5 and now 50.
50 right there, and now 55.

25:10.384 --> 25:12.094
55,000 here. Now 60.

25:12.178 --> 25:16.057
60,000. Who will bid 60,000?
Do I have 60,000?

25:16.140 --> 25:19.101
55, going once, going twice.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.603
Sold for 55,000.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.814
Next up, lot 87.

25:24.731 --> 25:28.694
Liquidation of
Union Allied Construction LLC.

25:28.777 --> 25:32.239
Forty-two desktops
with Thunderbolt display,

25:32.323 --> 25:35.576
14 copy machines, 62 IP phones,

25:35.659 --> 25:38.745
as well as supporting equipment
listed in your catalog.

25:38.829 --> 25:42.166
Estimated value, 540,000.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.335
We'll start the bidding at 70,000.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.212
Do I hear 70,000?

25:48.130 --> 25:51.592
70,000 right here, and now 75.
75,000?

25:51.675 --> 25:53.552
I have 75 over here, and now 80.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.762
Do I have 80,000? 80,000.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.931
80,000 in the back, thank you.
And now 90...

25:58.474 --> 26:01.185
Stop what you're doing.
Don't turn around.

26:01.268 --> 26:04.355
[auctioneer] 100,000. Who'll bid 100,000?
Right here, now 110...

26:04.438 --> 26:06.064
This is how you get caught.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.609
[auctioneer] 110, and now 120...
110, and now 120...

26:08.692 --> 26:10.652
The hell do you care?

26:10.736 --> 26:13.405
To your right,
a woman in a white blouse.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.157
-Eyes front. Jesus!
-[gasps]

26:16.158 --> 26:18.785
To your left,
a man in a navy blue pinstripe suit.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.829
[auctioneer] 150 now, and 160.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.582
Who are they?

26:23.665 --> 26:26.960
Don't know.
But they aren't bidding either.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.920
[auctioneer]
Who'll bid 180,000? Now 190.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.548
190. 190 here, now...

26:31.632 --> 26:32.716
What do I do?

26:32.799 --> 26:36.512
Spend the next hour raising your paddle.
Win something.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.390
One of the smaller lots.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.726
-I don't have any money.
-[Ben] Figure it out.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.520
Meet me at the diner when you're done.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.564
How did you know I was here?

26:50.108 --> 26:51.318
Ben?

26:52.653 --> 26:54.238
[auctioneer]
225, now 230?

26:55.197 --> 26:58.033
225 going once, going twice.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.869
Sold for $225,000.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.311
Let's go.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.730
[grunting]

27:32.193 --> 27:33.652
[Claire screaming]

27:40.826 --> 27:42.953
It's okay. It's me, Santino.

27:45.206 --> 27:46.623
[speaking Spanish]
Do you remember me?

27:47.583 --> 27:49.125
Yes.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.463
Claire's been taken
by some very bad people.

27:52.546 --> 27:54.340
I heard them say your name.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.303
I need your help. Please.

28:00.221 --> 28:04.308
I didn't say anything.
Not at first.

28:04.391 --> 28:07.769
Then they took me up to the roof
like you did with that man...

28:07.853 --> 28:10.564
They told me
if I said anything to anyone...

28:10.647 --> 28:12.941
they'd come back for my mother.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.110
Do you know where they took Claire?

28:15.193 --> 28:16.695
No.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.196
I'm sorry...

28:18.780 --> 28:20.949
Those men are going to hurt her
because of me.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.410
No, it's not your fault, Santino.

28:23.494 --> 28:25.371
It's mine.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.750
Is there anything else you heard or saw?

28:30.667 --> 28:32.586
Anything that might help me find her?

28:33.504 --> 28:35.631
I saw them get into a taxi.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.175
But not in the back, in the front.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.553
Like it was theirs.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.514
What was the company?

28:44.515 --> 28:45.891
Did you see a name?

28:48.394 --> 28:50.979
Veles. Veles Taxi.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.818
[soft music playing]

29:08.079 --> 29:09.164
Yes.

29:16.129 --> 29:17.839
I hope you like it.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.350
It's delicious.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.437
I don't know much about wine.

29:32.228 --> 29:34.565
My assistant, he recommended it.

29:34.648 --> 29:36.567
Maybe I should be out with him.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.654
-That was a joke.
-Yes, of course.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.657
[chuckles] A bad one, but...
mmm...

29:44.700 --> 29:46.743
You don't do this much, do you?

29:46.827 --> 29:47.869
No.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.583
I've been preoccupied...
for a long time.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.964
This is nice.
I didn't even know it was here.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.882
Yes, it just opened last month.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.635
The city's really changing.

30:04.553 --> 30:05.887
Not fast enough.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.848
I don't know.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.684
Be a shame to see
all the character scrubbed away.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.769
You didn't grow up here, did you?

30:12.853 --> 30:14.062
[laughs]

30:14.145 --> 30:16.189
What gave it away?

30:19.109 --> 30:22.904
When I was a kid, I used to dream
what it would be like to...

30:26.032 --> 30:28.702
to live somewhere far away
from Hell's Kitchen.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.621
Somewhere beautiful.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.541
What made you stay?

30:34.625 --> 30:36.126
I didn't.

30:36.209 --> 30:40.422
When I was 12 years old, my mother,
she sent me to stay with relatives.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.592
Had a farm, middle of nowhere.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.262
Those were good years.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.015
But you came back.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.182
Yes.

30:53.352 --> 30:56.813
Time and distance,

30:56.897 --> 30:59.065
they afford a certain clarity.

30:59.149 --> 31:02.318
I realized that
this city was a part of me,

31:02.403 --> 31:04.655
that it was in my blood.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.950
And I would do anything
to make it a better place...

31:09.785 --> 31:11.578
for people like you.

31:11.662 --> 31:12.913
[chuckles]

31:18.126 --> 31:20.170
To a better place.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.011
[grunting]

31:31.139 --> 31:32.849
[gasping]

31:34.560 --> 31:35.602
[coughing]

31:35.686 --> 31:38.188
You answer, he stops hitting you.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.566
-Everyone is happy.
-[breathing heavily]

31:40.649 --> 31:42.859
I told you, I don't know who he is.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.487
[screaming]

31:47.238 --> 31:48.490
Tell me his name.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.619
[mouthing]
I don't know.

31:52.703 --> 31:54.955
He never told me. He never told me!

31:55.747 --> 31:57.290
[speaking Russian]
Sergei...

31:57.373 --> 32:00.919
Vladimir told us not to kill her
until she talks.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.339
[speaking English]
This gives me no pleasure.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.632
It really doesn't.

32:05.716 --> 32:07.759
But I have been given a job to do.

32:07.843 --> 32:11.638
So please, answer the questions
that I was told to ask.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.100
[breathing heavily]

32:16.392 --> 32:19.646
Or I will begin breaking you,
a piece at a time.

32:21.523 --> 32:22.899
[man speaking Russian]

32:23.942 --> 32:25.276
[speaking Russian]
Mikhail, check the breaker.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.237
Check the breaker!

32:27.320 --> 32:28.989
[man replies in Russian]

32:29.072 --> 32:30.323
[Claire sobbing]

32:34.661 --> 32:35.704
[man screaming]

32:35.787 --> 32:37.122
[speaking Russian]

32:37.205 --> 32:38.331
Mikhail?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.001
Mikhail!

32:41.585 --> 32:42.794
[laughing]

32:45.005 --> 32:47.048
You want to know his name?

32:49.342 --> 32:50.886
-Ask him yourself.
-[metal clanging]

33:07.653 --> 33:08.654
[man screaming]

33:09.530 --> 33:10.531

33:11.322 --> 33:12.323
[man shouts in Russian]

33:22.458 --> 33:23.710

33:31.259 --> 33:32.260
[grunts]

[panting]

34:09.673 --> 34:10.882
[object rattles]

34:20.934 --> 34:22.435
-Up.
-[yelps]

34:23.687 --> 34:24.896
[Masked Man] Let her go.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.147
[coughing]

34:27.899 --> 34:29.860
[Sergei] I'm walking out of here.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.987
[Masked Man] No, you aren't.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.658
I'm not playing with you, man.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.995
I'm walking out of here--
I'll blow her brains out!

34:40.078 --> 34:42.163
[Masked Man] Put the gun down...

34:42.247 --> 34:45.208
or I promise you you'll never
hold anything in that hand again.

34:45.291 --> 34:46.459
[speaking Russian]

34:46.542 --> 34:47.753
-[Sergei grunting]
-[Claire shrieks]

34:47.836 --> 34:48.920
[gun fires]

34:50.088 --> 34:51.256
-[bones cracking]
-[Sergei groaning]

34:53.091 --> 34:56.427
It hurts, doesn't it?
Being in pain, being afraid.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.030
It's okay.

35:16.572 --> 35:18.700
[Claire sobbing]

35:18.784 --> 35:19.951
I'm here.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.246
I have you.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.709
[people talking indistinctly]

35:49.230 --> 35:51.775
-You bid on anything?
-Yeah.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.903
Some, uh...
office equipment from a realtor.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.487
Nearly as old as I am.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.574
Win?

35:59.658 --> 36:02.035
Yeah, 3,500 I don't have.

36:02.118 --> 36:05.288
I charged it to the law firm where I work.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.415
Probably just got my ass fired.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.293
Beats the alternative.

36:12.963 --> 36:14.756
-[waitress] More coffee?
-Uh, can I have a decaf?

36:14.840 --> 36:16.049
-Oh, sure thing.
-Thanks.

36:20.636 --> 36:23.264
How did you know I was gonna be there?

36:25.266 --> 36:27.227
Wasn't looking for you.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.440
I thought you weren't interested.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.110
I said you should move on.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.403
Didn't say anything about me.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.240
So I was right.

36:41.532 --> 36:42.993
About the office equipment.

36:43.076 --> 36:46.246
Union Allied or whatever it is
that they're calling themselves now,

36:46.329 --> 36:47.873
they're buying it back.

36:48.456 --> 36:51.877
I mean, you follow that, maybe
you find the guy behind the curtain.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.337
You said you read a bunch of my articles.

36:55.546 --> 36:58.466
Remember the one about the, uh...
the runoff?

36:59.509 --> 37:01.970
What that company
was dumping into the river?

37:02.053 --> 37:03.471
Yeah, sure.

37:03.554 --> 37:07.893
Fished the guy that tipped me off
out of that same river a month later.

37:09.770 --> 37:13.273
And that fella trying to
clean up the Teachers Union?

37:13.356 --> 37:15.650
Moved out of state...

37:15.734 --> 37:18.444
after flyers went up
saying he was a pedophile.

37:20.739 --> 37:24.284
They underestimated what
people in power will do to stay there.

37:24.367 --> 37:28.329
Didn't think you'd make the same mistake
after what happened to you.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.127
What about the woman?

37:35.295 --> 37:38.714
From your first series of articles
about the VA?

37:38.799 --> 37:40.591
What happened to her?

37:42.052 --> 37:43.970
She met the worst fate.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.140
Married beneath her...

37:48.224 --> 37:50.726
to a workaholic who never appreciated her.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.356
[sighs]
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--

37:55.440 --> 37:57.525
We need to be smart.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.986
Smarter than they are.

38:00.070 --> 38:04.532
Don't visit me at the office anymore,
and don't tell anyone else about this.

38:04.615 --> 38:09.120
If that doesn't work for you,
get up and get the hell out of my life.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.584
-That works for me.
-Good.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.169
[clears throat]

38:16.252 --> 38:20.465
First thing, sign the agreement
from the Union Allied lawyer.

38:20.548 --> 38:21.800
What? No!

38:21.883 --> 38:25.887
No, I sign that,
I can't ever talk publicly about this.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.097
Yeah...

38:28.306 --> 38:29.682
but I'm not signing it.

38:33.103 --> 38:34.855
-[men speaking Russian]
-[man groaning]

38:39.609 --> 38:40.819
[Vladimir] Sergei.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.404
[speaking Russian]
Sergei...

38:44.155 --> 38:45.615
Who did this?

38:46.950 --> 38:48.576
The man in black...

38:49.202 --> 38:50.912
-[clears throat]
-[cell phone ringing]

38:52.205 --> 38:53.331
[answering in Russian]

38:54.540 --> 38:56.084
All right. Stay there.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.503
That was Piotr.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.838
Fisk has come out of hiding.

39:01.547 --> 39:03.383
We need his help, brother.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.594
I will not bow before that man!

39:10.265 --> 39:12.517
Then I will go...

39:12.600 --> 39:15.020
And bow for both of us.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.612
Go.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.948
Make the deal.

39:34.455 --> 39:35.999
Are you sure about dessert?

39:36.082 --> 39:38.418
-[chuckles]
-They have an incredible Zuppa Inglese.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.296
Don't children have that
at birthday parties?

39:41.379 --> 39:43.298
-Yes.
-[laughs]

39:43.381 --> 39:45.716
When I was a kid, I loved it.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.220
Probably loved it a bit too much.

39:51.097 --> 39:54.017
Well, now I have to know
what it tastes like.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.768
You wanna split one?

39:55.851 --> 39:57.103
Yes.

39:58.939 --> 40:00.982
-We'll have a Zuppa.
-[waiter] Yes, sir.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.948
[whispering]
Chocolate was always my downfall.

40:08.031 --> 40:11.701
Milk chocolate, not the dark stuff
they say is better for you.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.244
I can order something else.

40:13.328 --> 40:16.998
No, no, it's good to try new things.
Get out of the comfort zone.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.960
Yes, we get caught up
in what we're doing...

40:22.128 --> 40:23.964
who we think we are.

40:24.047 --> 40:25.173
So...

40:27.050 --> 40:28.927
who are you, Wilson?

40:30.803 --> 40:32.722
Tonight, I'm just a man...

40:33.848 --> 40:36.684
enjoying the company
of a captivating woman.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.772
[Wesley] I told you he's indisposed.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.608
[speaking Russian]

40:44.985 --> 40:47.278
Sir, I need to speak with you.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.779
What is this?

40:50.156 --> 40:52.575
We need to go... now.
I'm sorry.

40:52.658 --> 40:55.120
I want to tell you, my brother and I,
we gratefully accept--

40:55.203 --> 40:57.663
[Fisk] Wesley will take care of you.

40:57.747 --> 40:59.249
[whispering] Put him in a car.

40:59.332 --> 41:00.708
Understood.

41:04.212 --> 41:06.506
[Karen] Promise you won't get mad.

41:07.215 --> 41:10.593
[chuckling] You bought a fax machine?
From the early '90s.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.762
Oh, it's not that old... I think.

41:12.845 --> 41:15.223
Um, but the rest of the stuff's
coming tomorrow.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.349
The rest?

41:16.432 --> 41:19.394
Yeah, like, a printer
and conference phones and a copier and...

41:19.477 --> 41:23.148
Yeah, there was an auction and,
you know, we needed stuff, so I, um...

41:23.231 --> 41:24.649
charged it to the office.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.192
But don't freak out, okay?

41:26.276 --> 41:28.861
I got a thing,
some money coming in from...

41:29.820 --> 41:31.781
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.116
You mad?

41:35.285 --> 41:37.912
I ever tell you my mom
wanted me to be a butcher?

41:38.997 --> 41:40.081
A butcher?

41:40.165 --> 41:42.292
Yeah. You know what I told her?

41:47.547 --> 41:49.882
This isn't gonna feel great.

41:51.967 --> 41:53.053
Ow.

41:59.767 --> 42:02.395
You got pretty good hands for a blind guy.

42:03.896 --> 42:05.648
Used to patch up my dad.

42:06.857 --> 42:09.069
He ran around in a mask, too?

42:10.570 --> 42:12.113
He was a boxer.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.034
-Took a lot of beatings.
-Huh.

42:16.742 --> 42:18.703
So you take after him then.

42:18.786 --> 42:19.954
[chuckles]

42:20.955 --> 42:21.956
Ow.

42:22.748 --> 42:23.874
Shit.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.127
I'm sorry.

42:27.587 --> 42:28.629
[sighs]

42:28.713 --> 42:31.006
It's okay.
You've had a lot worse.

42:32.883 --> 42:35.970
I mean, [stammering]
I'm sorry for getting you into this. I...

42:38.806 --> 42:42.102
I never thought that
I'd be putting anyone else at risk.

42:44.312 --> 42:45.813
It was my choice.

42:45.896 --> 42:49.484
You didn't ask me
to pull you from that dumpster.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.445
No, you did it because
you're a good person.

42:53.696 --> 42:55.740
And you almost got killed...

42:57.533 --> 42:58.868
because of me.

42:58.951 --> 43:00.995
Tell me it was worth it.

43:02.997 --> 43:06.584
Tell me that you've got a plan...
an end game.

43:06.667 --> 43:09.129
-Claire...
-Anything?

43:10.796 --> 43:11.839
[sighs]

43:11.922 --> 43:14.717
I'm just trying to make
my city a better place, that's all.

43:14.800 --> 43:15.926
[sighs]

43:17.178 --> 43:20.598
Ow. I think maybe it's a little more
complicated than that now.

43:21.932 --> 43:24.144
Nothing's changing out there.

43:25.978 --> 43:28.814
No matter what I do,
I'm just-- I'm making things worse.

43:28.898 --> 43:32.443
Tell that to the boy
you saved from the Russians.

43:32.527 --> 43:34.154
Or all the other people you've helped.

43:34.237 --> 43:37.698
And what about the people
I've gotten hurt? What do I...

43:37.782 --> 43:38.949
What do I tell them?

43:44.622 --> 43:46.249
Feel my heart.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.253
Come on, feel it.

43:54.132 --> 43:56.259
What is it telling you?

44:01.681 --> 44:02.848
That you're scared.

44:05.059 --> 44:06.519
Because I am.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.981
More than I've ever been in my life.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.734
And I am not alone.

44:15.570 --> 44:18.573
But you can do something about it...

44:18.656 --> 44:20.950
for all of us, Mike.

44:24.579 --> 44:25.705
Matthew.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.295
My name is Matthew.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.641
-[Fisk] Will I see you again?
-[sighs]

44:46.559 --> 44:49.395
I don't usually date customers.

44:49.479 --> 44:51.731
You came out with me tonight.

44:52.648 --> 44:55.109
And here we are, so...

44:56.068 --> 44:57.820
I can...

44:57.903 --> 45:00.906
return the painting,
and then I'd no longer be a--

45:00.990 --> 45:03.243
I'm not interested in gestures, Wilson,

45:03.326 --> 45:05.703
or your money, or...

45:07.663 --> 45:10.291
whatever that was all about
at the restaurant.

45:11.376 --> 45:13.794
I went out with you because...

45:16.756 --> 45:19.384
there's something different about you.

45:20.635 --> 45:22.387
Not so sure it's a good thing now.

45:23.304 --> 45:24.889
Like you said...

45:26.599 --> 45:28.393
I don't do this much.

45:29.394 --> 45:33.481
And I'm sorry that our night,
it went sideways.

45:34.815 --> 45:35.983
But...

45:37.860 --> 45:41.113
I enjoyed our time together
very much, Vanessa.

45:44.033 --> 45:46.118
If you don't feel the same...

45:47.161 --> 45:48.829
even a little bit...

45:49.747 --> 45:54.043
just tell me,
and I promise you won't see me again.

46:03.135 --> 46:04.219
I...

46:06.221 --> 46:08.140
don't know how I feel.

46:28.243 --> 46:29.286
[Wesley chuckles]

46:29.370 --> 46:33.499
And even after all that, you didn't
even get a name out of the girl?

46:33.583 --> 46:34.625
No.

46:35.626 --> 46:38.379
The man in black
came before our men had finished.

46:40.590 --> 46:43.884
You were right to
reach out to us, although...

46:43.968 --> 46:45.928
a call would have been more appropriate.

46:47.096 --> 46:48.973
Look, I...

46:49.056 --> 46:51.976
I wanted to speak with him in person.

46:53.227 --> 46:55.563
Try to put the past behind us.

47:00.109 --> 47:01.276
[brakes screech lightly]

47:01.361 --> 47:03.404
[Anatoly]
Why are we stopping?

47:03.488 --> 47:06.366
They say the past is etched in stone,
but it isn't.

47:07.783 --> 47:10.661
It's... smoke

47:10.745 --> 47:13.748
trapped in a closed room, swirling...

47:13.831 --> 47:15.124
changing.

47:16.459 --> 47:21.171
Buffeted by the passing of years
and wishful thinking.

47:23.508 --> 47:26.427
But even though
our perception of it changes,

47:26.511 --> 47:28.220
one thing remains constant.

47:29.263 --> 47:30.931
The past can...

47:32.057 --> 47:35.102
never be completely erased.
It lingers.

47:37.647 --> 47:39.940
Like the scent of burning wood.

47:42.610 --> 47:44.153
[cell phone ringing]

47:48.198 --> 47:49.283
Sir?

47:50.576 --> 47:52.327
Yes, passenger side.

47:53.996 --> 47:55.581
Was that him?

47:55.665 --> 47:56.874
Mmm.

47:59.376 --> 48:01.796
He'd like to have a word with you.

48:01.879 --> 48:03.130
[speaking Russian]

48:05.758 --> 48:07.134
[both grunting]

48:10.513 --> 48:12.097
[both grunting]

48:27.237 --> 48:28.489
[speaking Russian]

48:34.454 --> 48:35.621
-[bones cracking]
-[shouting]

48:36.456 --> 48:38.123
You embarrassed me.

48:38.791 --> 48:40.918
You embarrassed me in front of her.

49:04.274 --> 49:05.568
[speaking Russian]

49:28.298 --> 49:29.550
[Fisk grunting]

49:39.268 --> 49:40.728
[squishing]

49:49.278 --> 49:50.320
[exhales]

49:55.743 --> 49:57.119
[breathing heavily]

50:04.835 --> 50:06.170
[sighs]

50:22.227 --> 50:25.314
Tell Mr. Potter I'll need a new suit.

50:27.066 --> 50:28.192
[Wesley] Hmm.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.905
What about this?

50:33.823 --> 50:36.408
Take what's left of him
and send it to his brother.

50:37.702 --> 50:39.369
It'll start a war.

50:41.413 --> 50:43.123
I'm counting on it.

50:54.594 --> 50:56.637
[dramatic music playing]
