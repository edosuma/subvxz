Ooh, let's see.

01:08.168 --> 01:11.403
In 1909,
Jupiter was here,

01:11.405 --> 01:14.506
so that means this year,
it will be--

01:14.508 --> 01:16.541
Donatello, emergency!

01:16.543 --> 01:17.842
What is it?
Shredder?

01:17.844 --> 01:20.445
Close. Shredded
mozzarella.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.380
Like in,
we're out of it.

01:22.382 --> 01:24.516
Yeah, and we've got
a major case

01:24.518 --> 01:26.818
of the midnight munchies.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.721
So we picked you to go
to the store and get some.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.190
There's a weird
planetary alignment

01:32.192 --> 01:33.692
coming up this week.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.928
Hey, planetary alignments
come and go,

01:36.930 --> 01:38.430
but pizza is forever.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.297
All right,

01:39.299 --> 01:40.698
I'll go to
the all-night market

01:40.700 --> 01:41.866
and pick some up,

01:41.868 --> 01:44.135

What's up?

01:58.852 --> 02:02.020
I had the weirdest feeling
somebody was following us.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.322
Sure. The turtle
curfew man.

02:08.060 --> 02:10.228
Let's take a shortcut
through this alley.

02:10.229 --> 02:13.331
Look what we've
got here.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.633
Little green sailors.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.134
Give us your money,

02:16.136 --> 02:18.203
or you'll be
sailing up the creek

Good line, pal.

your dialogue?

a couple of turtles!

more like it.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.315
Stop! I am zak,

02:30.317 --> 02:31.583
master ninja turtle,

02:31.585 --> 02:34.452
the scourge
of evildoers.

02:34.454 --> 02:35.754
Heh heh!
We got us

02:35.756 --> 02:37.689
a whole herd
of turtles.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.023
I'll show you.

02:39.025 --> 02:40.224
Hyah!

02:40.226 --> 02:41.393
Oops.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.794
Hyah!

02:42.796 --> 02:44.629
Aah!
Aah!

02:44.631 --> 02:47.332
Wise guy, huh?

02:49.602 --> 02:51.702
Whoa!

02:53.272 --> 02:54.606
Hyah!

02:54.608 --> 02:56.141
Whoops.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.643
Good move,
klutz.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.412
Let's get
out of here!

03:00.414 --> 03:04.649
Wow. You guys really
are the turtles.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.650
I know all
about you guys.

03:06.652 --> 03:09.286
You're Donatello
and you're Raphael.

03:09.288 --> 03:12.457
I want to help you guys
fight crime.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.625
I got my own junior
crime fighter kit

03:14.627 --> 03:16.962
and my own
turtle disguise.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.797
You're no crime fighter,
you're a menace.

03:19.799 --> 03:22.701
And you call this
a turtle disguise?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.102
Why don't you
go home, fella,

03:24.104 --> 03:25.770
before you
hurt yourself.

03:25.772 --> 03:28.840
I was only
trying to help.

03:30.575 --> 03:32.811
Hey, maybe we were
a little hard on the guy.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.478
I think we hurt
his feelings.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.048
We've got more important
things to worry about.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.751
Like what happened
to my turtlecom?

03:42.521 --> 03:44.322
I'll show them.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.891
I can be
a ninja turtle, too.

03:48.027 --> 03:51.463
Will you get
on with it, krang?

03:51.465 --> 03:54.266
All in good time,
my dear shredder.

03:54.268 --> 03:57.269
First a little
astronomy lesson.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.537
This is our solar system.

03:59.539 --> 04:03.174
Here are the earth and moon
orbiting the sun.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.342
Tomorrow, Mars here

04:05.344 --> 04:08.446
will be in perfect
alignment with them.

04:08.448 --> 04:09.848
Thusly--

04:09.850 --> 04:11.850
what does all this
have to do

04:11.852 --> 04:13.351
with the capsidium
crystals?

04:13.353 --> 04:16.353
Very simple,
even for you.

04:16.356 --> 04:19.023
When the planetary
conjunction occurs,

04:19.024 --> 04:21.493
you will
place the crystals

04:21.495 --> 04:25.195
beneath the telescope
at the planetarium.

04:25.197 --> 04:27.832
When the light
strikes the crystals,

04:27.834 --> 04:30.501
it will provide
enough power

04:30.503 --> 04:32.537
to raise
the technodrome

04:32.539 --> 04:35.307
to the surface
of the earth.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.541
You have less
than 24 hours

04:37.543 --> 04:39.177
to get the crystals

04:39.179 --> 04:41.045
and seize
the planetarium.

04:41.047 --> 04:42.847
<i>Ciao!</i>

04:42.849 --> 04:43.814
One day, krang,

04:43.816 --> 04:46.551
you'll order me around
once too often.

04:46.553 --> 04:47.718
Then I'll leave

04:47.720 --> 04:49.354
and you'll find yourself

04:49.356 --> 04:51.288
without your good
right hand.

04:58.964 --> 05:01.566
Where have you been,
little brother?

05:01.568 --> 05:04.736
I see you're still wearing
that dumb costume.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.138
Out looking
for turtles again?

05:07.140 --> 05:10.575
Yeah, only this time
I found them.

05:10.577 --> 05:11.943
Oh, yeah? Where?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.646
Down at the pet shop?
Ha ha ha ha!

05:14.648 --> 05:15.513
I did meet 'em.

05:15.515 --> 05:17.348
The ninja turtles
are real,

05:17.350 --> 05:18.782
and I'll prove it.

05:18.784 --> 05:20.151
Oh, you do that

05:20.153 --> 05:23.455
and I'll eat
that stupid costume.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.856
I will prove it.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.591
You'll see.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.830
I wonder what this thing is.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.531
If I give it back
to the turtles,

05:33.533 --> 05:35.767
maybe they'll let me
join them.

05:35.769 --> 05:39.103
Then I'll be
a ninja turtle, too.

05:39.105 --> 05:41.906
Wow, Irma,
listen to this.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.240
There's been
a break-in reported

05:43.242 --> 05:45.276
at the marconi
laboratories.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.811
Witnesses reported

05:46.813 --> 05:49.147
seeing a wart hog
and a rhinoceros.

05:49.149 --> 05:52.316
They must have had
a garage sale at the zoo.

05:52.318 --> 05:55.953
That could only be
rock steady and bebop.

05:55.955 --> 05:59.023
April to turtles,
come in, please.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.291
Come in, turtles.

06:00.293 --> 06:03.127
Donatello here.
What is it, April?

06:03.129 --> 06:04.229
Wow.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.997
It's a transmitter.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.131
We just got a report

06:07.133 --> 06:09.234
of a break-in
at the marconi labs.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.135
It sounds like
shredder's involved.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.538
Thanks, April.
We're on our way.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.607
Right, we're on our way.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.141
I got to fix
this thing.

06:17.143 --> 06:18.343
I'm getting an echo.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.144
ROCK STEADY:
[SNORTS] Gee, boss.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.747
They've got a lot
of neat stuff in here.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.215
BEBOP: Yeah.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.651
Quickly. Open that safe
and get those crystals.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.987
Sure, boss.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.359
Not that way,
you slug.

06:35.361 --> 06:38.797
The capsidium crystals
are very fragile.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.165
Yeah, you got
to be more gentle.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.833
Allow me.

06:44.369 --> 06:45.470
Whoa!

06:45.472 --> 06:47.071
Got them, boss.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.473
Don't you know
it's not nice

06:48.475 --> 06:51.042
to take things that
don't belong to you?

06:51.044 --> 06:53.211
The turtles!

06:53.213 --> 06:56.381
Blah! I'm gonna fry me
some turtle hash.

06:56.383 --> 06:59.784
You will not stop me,
you mettlesome reptiles.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.185
Get serious, dude.

07:01.187 --> 07:04.122
They don't call this
the shredder show.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.557
What?

07:05.559 --> 07:08.460
Here I come!
I'll help you!

07:08.462 --> 07:10.361
Turtle power--whaa!

07:12.097 --> 07:13.865
I don't know
who you are,

07:13.867 --> 07:15.700
but thanks
for interfering.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.969
That should keep
you turtles busy.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.640
Tough doody, squids.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.478
It's that fake turtle.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.312
He's in big trouble.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.816
DONATELLO: The pendulum is
gonna crush him.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.226
Burne is gonna love
this footage.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.394
I'll save
the nutcase.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.129
You stop them.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.900
Ready or not,
here I come. Unh!

07:48.902 --> 07:52.002
Grab onto my shell
and hang on.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.641
Thanks, Raphael. I--

07:56.643 --> 07:58.543
later, fella.

08:00.212 --> 08:03.348
Come out and fight,
you weasels.

08:03.350 --> 08:06.617
How about if I
send a friend?

08:09.688 --> 08:12.056
Come along,
you clumsy ignoramuses.

08:12.058 --> 08:15.526
This should prove
electrifying, turtles.

08:17.729 --> 08:19.797
Come on!
Whoa!

08:20.966 --> 08:23.634
What a great story.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.837
No pictures, lady.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.672
Give that back.
Ooh!

08:27.674 --> 08:29.407
Yeow!

08:29.409 --> 08:32.275
You won't be so
gutsy tomorrow night

08:32.278 --> 08:34.645
when we
raise the techno--

08:34.648 --> 08:36.780
quiet, you bugbrain.

08:36.782 --> 08:39.616
Farewell, turtles.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.119
After them!

08:41.121 --> 08:42.453
Whoa!
Oh!

08:42.455 --> 08:46.824
Sure. As soon as you
shut off that lightning.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.025
I'll do it.

08:49.995 --> 08:54.132
Excellent, April.
Just like mother nature.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.066
They got away again.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.135
Another turtle
adventure concluded.

08:58.137 --> 08:59.804
Time to leave.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.307
Hold it right there,
Mr. mock turtle.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.741
Hi, guys.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.143
That's the second time

09:05.145 --> 09:07.211
you've gotten
in our way.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.479
I was just
trying to help.

09:09.481 --> 09:12.249
Hey, he's only
a microdude.

09:12.251 --> 09:15.720
I'm almost 14,
and my name is zak.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.689
You really messed things
up back there, zak.

09:18.691 --> 09:19.691
I didn't mean to.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.992
I think you guys
are the greatest.

09:21.994 --> 09:24.394
I want to be
a ninja turtle fighter

09:24.396 --> 09:25.630
just like you.

09:25.632 --> 09:26.663
Get real, kid.

09:26.665 --> 09:29.367
Nobody wants to be
a mutant turtle.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.236
Well, you wouldn't want
to be me either.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.607
Meanwhile, shredder
and his weirdoes got away.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.508
I've got news for you,

09:37.510 --> 09:39.510
so has our
mystery turtle.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.011
The kid's gone.

09:41.013 --> 09:43.381
Uh, how did he know
we were here?

09:43.383 --> 09:45.182
There's only one way--

09:45.184 --> 09:47.885
because he's
got my turtlecom.

09:47.887 --> 09:50.020
There's something more important
to worry about.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.522
Like why rock steady said

09:51.524 --> 09:54.392
they were raising
the technodrome tomorrow.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.636
Ecch!

10:05.638 --> 10:08.439
There's something sticky
on the floor of the van.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.907
Michelangelo!

10:09.909 --> 10:11.876
Hey, don't look at me.

10:11.878 --> 10:15.212
I haven't eaten pizza in it
for a whole month.

10:16.447 --> 10:19.617
Now for my ultraviolet

I put in their van works.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.155
All right!

10:27.058 --> 10:29.093
I expect some gratitude

10:29.095 --> 10:31.628

our mission, krang.

10:31.630 --> 10:32.830
Your stupid mutants

10:32.832 --> 10:35.299

the crystals,

10:35.301 --> 10:38.435
then they told
the turtles our plan,

10:38.437 --> 10:40.571
and you
want gratitude? Ha!

10:40.573 --> 10:42.906
Why is it whenever
they do something wrong,

10:42.908 --> 10:44.809
they're <i> my</i> stupid

Never mind that.

soon figure out

10:47.247 --> 10:51.482

of our plan takes place,

try to stop us.

that they fail.

10:58.858 --> 11:02.093
I am sure that the theft
of the capsidium crystals

11:02.095 --> 11:03.861
has something to do

11:03.863 --> 11:06.330
with raising
the technodrome.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.233
Oh, for sure.
But what?

11:09.235 --> 11:11.101
That's it.
Those crystals

11:11.103 --> 11:13.771

kind of light
