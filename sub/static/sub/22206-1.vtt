<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick</b>.</font>

05:39.570 --> 05:42.530
I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.

05:45.370 --> 05:49.870
I was careful not to drag in any dirt.

05:50.830 --> 05:52.750
I don't mind the dirt.

05:54.460 --> 05:56.420
I do mind...

05:57.220 --> 05:59.350
...unannounced visits.

06:02.390 --> 06:03.440
You police?

06:05.560 --> 06:10.150
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

06:10.310 --> 06:13.440
- I'm a farmer.
- I saw that.

06:14.610 --> 06:16.450
What do you farm?

06:23.660 --> 06:25.580
It's a protein farm.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.960
Wallace design.

06:29.670 --> 06:30.920
Is that what I smell?

06:32.130 --> 06:34.220
Grow that just for me.

06:34.710 --> 06:35.870
Garlic.

06:36.050 --> 06:37.390
Garlic.

06:38.050 --> 06:39.970
Go on, try some.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.520
No, thank you.

06:44.220 --> 06:48.300
I prefer to keep an empty stomach
until the hard part of the day is done.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.770
How long you been here?

06:52.940 --> 06:55.070
Since 2020.

06:55.690 --> 06:58.560
But you haven't always been a farmer,
have you?

07:00.240 --> 07:01.580
Your bag.

07:02.070 --> 07:03.860
It's colonial medical use.

07:04.370 --> 07:06.290
Military issue.

07:08.450 --> 07:11.910
Where were you? Calantha?

07:15.630 --> 07:17.680
Must have been brutal.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.140
Plan on taking me in?

07:21.220 --> 07:24.270
Let them take a look inside?

07:24.930 --> 07:26.730
Mr. Morton...

07:27.390 --> 07:30.060
...if taking you in is an option...

07:34.100 --> 07:37.230
...I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

07:38.190 --> 07:41.150
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

07:43.110 --> 07:45.650
I'm sorry it had to be me.

07:48.910 --> 07:50.780
Good as any.

07:53.710 --> 07:56.550
Now, if you don't mind...

07:58.130 --> 08:01.180
...if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

08:57.690 --> 08:58.820
Please don't get up.

09:10.780 --> 09:14.240
How's it feel killing your own kind?

09:17.830 --> 09:21.500
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.550
Only older models do.

09:24.720 --> 09:29.520
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

09:34.140 --> 09:37.180
...because you've never seen a miracle.

10:18.060 --> 10:20.530
Just photograph everything.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.650
Madam, please.

10:33.830 --> 10:37.380
Incoming L.A.P.D. re-codec hash.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.800
You're hurt. I'm not paying for that.

10:43.460 --> 10:44.790
- I'll glue it.
- And?

10:51.680 --> 10:53.520
One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.310
He looks like he could take
your head off.

10:56.470 --> 10:57.680
He tried.

10:57.850 --> 10:59.610
He went AWOL after Calantha...

10:59.770 --> 11:03.070
...with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closing out.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.110
- Just him?
- Just him.

11:06.190 --> 11:08.440
Come on home for your baseline.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.410
One moment, madam.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.420
Thirty meters to maximum depth.

12:19.470 --> 12:20.510
What is that?

12:26.650 --> 12:27.820
I'll send a dig team.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.810
Come on home before the storm.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.680
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

13:51.860 --> 13:55.030
- Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.

13:55.990 --> 13:57.410
Recite your baseline.

13:57.570 --> 14:01.070
And blood-black nothingness
began to spin.

14:02.490 --> 14:05.120
A system of cells interlinked
within cells...

14:05.290 --> 14:08.340
...interlinked within cells
interlinked within one stem.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.630
Fuck off, skin-job.

14:11.880 --> 14:17.180
And dreadfully distinct against the dark,
a tall white fountain played.

14:18.130 --> 14:19.170
- Cells.
- Cells.

14:19.380 --> 14:22.300
Have you ever been
in an institution? Cells.

14:22.510 --> 14:24.720
- Do they keep you in a cell? Cells.
- Cells.

14:24.890 --> 14:28.770
When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

14:28.940 --> 14:30.650
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

14:30.810 --> 14:33.980
What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love? Interlinked.

14:34.150 --> 14:37.280
Did they teach you how to feel
finger to finger? Interlinked.

14:37.440 --> 14:40.400
Do you long for having
your heart interlinked? Interlinked.

14:40.570 --> 14:42.940
- Do you dream about being interlinked?
- Interlinked.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.960
What's it like to hold your child
in your arms? Interlinked.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.210
Do you feel that there's a part of you
that's missing? Interlinked.

14:49.370 --> 14:51.790
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.170
Why don't you say that three times?

14:54.340 --> 14:57.220
Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.

14:57.380 --> 15:00.050
Within cells interlinked.

15:02.260 --> 15:03.880
We're done.

15:05.220 --> 15:07.260
Constant K.

15:07.430 --> 15:09.640
You can pick up your bonus.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.930
Thank you, sir.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.980
Caution, keep clear.

15:15.150 --> 15:16.820
Caution, keep clear.

15:18.530 --> 15:20.530
Caution, keep clear.

15:20.700 --> 15:24.160
Connect to Off-world any time,
any place.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.740
Packages start at 20 minutes.

15:26.910 --> 15:29.200
Many options available.

15:33.210 --> 15:36.840
Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.840
Connect to Off-world any time,
any place.

15:41.010 --> 15:43.970
Packages start at 20 minutes.

16:24.340 --> 16:27.920
K? I didn't hear you. You're early.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.060
You want me to come back?

16:30.220 --> 16:32.470
- Just go scrub.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:34.230 --> 16:36.230
How was your meeting?

16:37.650 --> 16:39.490
The usual.

16:39.980 --> 16:41.810
How was your day?

16:43.030 --> 16:45.330
I'm getting cabin fever.

16:45.780 --> 16:49.900
99.9 percent detoxified water.

16:52.750 --> 16:57.670
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

16:57.830 --> 17:01.960
I'm sure I can fix that for you.
Let me take a look at it.

17:07.890 --> 17:09.890
I need a drink.

17:10.470 --> 17:13.180
- Do you want a drink first?
- Pour me one, will you?

17:15.770 --> 17:19.280
I'm trying a new recipe.
I just need a bit more practice.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.490
Don't fuss.

17:23.609 --> 17:28.230
I should have marinated it longer.
I hope it isn't dry.

17:30.160 --> 17:35.250
Did you know this song was released
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

17:35.410 --> 17:37.950
It was number one on the charts.

17:42.750 --> 17:46.960
It won't be much longer.
Just putting on the finishing touches.

17:50.640 --> 17:54.480
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.220
I told you not to fuss.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.240
And yet...

18:02.820 --> 18:05.320
Voilà! Bon appétit.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.660
I missed you, baby sweet.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.750
Honey, it's beautiful.

18:14.330 --> 18:16.460
Just put your feet up.

18:16.870 --> 18:18.160
Relax.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.260
Was a day?

18:39.940 --> 18:41.860
It was a day.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.570
Would you read to me?

18:45.650 --> 18:46.900
It'll make you feel better.

18:47.650 --> 18:49.820
- You hate that book.
- I don't wanna read either.

18:52.660 --> 18:53.710
Let's dance.

18:53.870 --> 18:56.370
Do you wanna dance,
or do you wanna open your present?

18:56.540 --> 18:58.130
What present?

19:02.170 --> 19:04.510
- This one.
- What's the occasion?

19:05.250 --> 19:07.420
Let's just say...

19:07.590 --> 19:09.970
- ...it's our anniversary.
- Is it?

19:11.890 --> 19:15.890
No, but let's just say that it is.

19:16.850 --> 19:17.900
Okay?

19:21.940 --> 19:22.980
Happy anniversary.

19:24.820 --> 19:26.070
An emanator.

20:09.280 --> 20:10.410
Thank you.

20:10.570 --> 20:14.990
Honey, you can go anywhere you want
in the world now.

20:15.820 --> 20:18.030
Where do you wanna go first?

22:31.960 --> 22:34.210
I'm so happy when I'm with you.

22:36.590 --> 22:37.850
You don't have to say that.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.260
The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.

23:13.420 --> 23:14.760
Get down here.

23:28.600 --> 23:33.100
Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

23:52.710 --> 23:57.340
Your box is a military footlocker,
issued to Sapper Morton...

23:57.500 --> 24:02.210
...creatively repurposed as an ossuary:
a box of bones.

24:02.380 --> 24:04.630
Nothing else in it but hair.

24:05.640 --> 24:09.810
The soil samples indicate
that she's been buried for 30 years.

24:10.560 --> 24:14.610
Bones all dismantled, fully cleaned,
meticulously laid to rest.

24:14.770 --> 24:16.430
"She"?

24:17.570 --> 24:18.700
Cause of death, Coco?

24:30.080 --> 24:34.050
No breaks, no sign of trauma, except...

24:34.210 --> 24:37.300
...a fracture through the ilium.

24:37.790 --> 24:40.540
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.790
She was pregnant?

24:43.970 --> 24:45.430
So he didn't kill her?

24:45.590 --> 24:46.920
She died in childbirth.

24:49.310 --> 24:50.810
What's that?

24:51.930 --> 24:53.510
Go back.

24:54.310 --> 24:55.810
Closer.

24:57.150 --> 24:58.780
Closer.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.980
What's that?

25:06.200 --> 25:09.960
Notching in the iliac crest.

25:10.120 --> 25:13.500
It's fine-point, like a scalpel.

25:14.410 --> 25:17.370
That looks like an emergency C-section.

25:17.540 --> 25:21.210
The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.

25:21.760 --> 25:26.430
He was a combat medic. Maybe he tried
to save her, and he just couldn't.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.970
He didn't seem like the saving type.

25:29.140 --> 25:31.230
He went to the trouble of burying her.

25:31.390 --> 25:32.900
A sentimental skin-job.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.030
Sorry.

25:37.190 --> 25:39.650
So where's the kid?

25:40.610 --> 25:42.490
You scan the whole field?

25:42.650 --> 25:45.020
Just dirt and worms. No other bodies.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.160
Maybe he ate it.

26:35.790 --> 26:37.710
That's not possible.

26:40.170 --> 26:42.420
She was a Replicant.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.290
Pregnant.

26:55.390 --> 26:58.350
The world is built on a wall.

26:58.730 --> 27:00.900
It separates kind.

27:01.480 --> 27:05.490
Tell either side there's no wall,
you bought a war.

27:05.650 --> 27:07.520
Or a slaughter.

27:11.110 --> 27:13.320
So what you saw...

27:15.120 --> 27:16.330
...didn't happen.

27:18.750 --> 27:20.090
Yes, madam.

27:20.250 --> 27:23.090
It is my job to keep order.

27:23.250 --> 27:26.370
That's what we do here. We keep order.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.040
You want it gone?

27:31.090 --> 27:32.710
Erase everything.

27:32.890 --> 27:35.810
- Even the child?
- All trace.

27:39.890 --> 27:42.310
You have anything more to say?

27:43.730 --> 27:46.980
I've never retired something
that was born before.

27:47.730 --> 27:49.730
What's the difference?

27:53.700 --> 27:56.000
To be born is to have a soul, I guess.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.490
Are you telling me no?

28:00.080 --> 28:02.080
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

28:02.670 --> 28:04.300
Attaboy.

28:07.300 --> 28:11.100
Hey. You've been getting on fine
without one.

28:11.260 --> 28:12.310
What's that, madam?

28:13.340 --> 28:14.960
A soul.

29:01.730 --> 29:06.320
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

29:08.770 --> 29:11.860
...because you've never seen a miracle.

29:35.380 --> 29:38.340
Just checking in on an old serial number.

29:42.890 --> 29:44.430
Confirmation DNA?

29:45.770 --> 29:47.530
I got hair.

30:06.330 --> 30:08.160
An old one.

30:08.630 --> 30:10.550
Pre-Blackout.

30:11.670 --> 30:14.090
That's gonna be tough.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.430
Not much from then.

30:16.590 --> 30:18.710
And what's there is...

30:19.050 --> 30:20.920
...thick milky.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.520
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

30:24.890 --> 30:27.430
As human as you want them to be.

30:27.810 --> 30:31.180
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

30:31.360 --> 30:36.030
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence, attachment or appeal.

30:36.490 --> 30:40.080
Unless you'd like to add
some pleasure models to your order.

30:53.500 --> 30:56.670
Would it be possible
to reschedule this call, please?

30:59.180 --> 31:02.520
Everyone remembers where they were
at the Blackout. You?

31:02.680 --> 31:04.270
That was a little before my time.

31:05.270 --> 31:08.520
I was home with my folks,
then 10 days of darkness.

31:08.690 --> 31:10.230
Every machine stopped cold.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.610
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

31:12.980 --> 31:18.400
Photos, files, every bit of data, gone.
Bank records too.

31:18.570 --> 31:19.730
Didn't mind that.

31:19.910 --> 31:21.950
It's funny it's only paper that lasted.

31:22.120 --> 31:25.580
I mean, we had everything on drives.
Everything, everything, everything.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.750
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

31:30.540 --> 31:34.210
Well, it's a shame.
You must have been adorable.

31:40.130 --> 31:43.260
Pretty fractured. Not much on it.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.300
One of the last gens, pre-Prohibition.

31:46.470 --> 31:48.340
Standard issue.

31:48.520 --> 31:51.110
- Made by Tyrell.
- And?

31:52.310 --> 31:53.930
Unremarkable.

31:54.110 --> 31:55.360
"Unremarkable"?

31:55.520 --> 31:58.360
There must be something else
we can find for him.

32:05.870 --> 32:08.630
Another prodigal serial number returns.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.090
A 30-year-old open case finally closed.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.500
Thank you, officer.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.210
I'm here for Mr. Wallace. I'm Luv.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.470
He named you.

32:23.180 --> 32:25.140
Must be special.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.350
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.090
Follow me.

32:34.900 --> 32:37.860
The ancient models give
the entire endeavor a bad name.

32:39.780 --> 32:43.950
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

32:47.530 --> 32:51.160
The outer colonies would never have
flourished had he not bought Tyrell...

32:51.330 --> 32:53.920
...revivified the technology.

32:54.330 --> 32:56.750
To say the least of what we do.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.850
I see you're also a customer.

33:09.010 --> 33:11.550
Are you satisfied with our product?

33:11.730 --> 33:15.860
She's very realistic. Thank you.

33:16.310 --> 33:18.890
Here. All the junk is in here.

33:19.070 --> 33:22.240
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

33:34.460 --> 33:36.800
No one's been down here in ages.

33:39.670 --> 33:41.510
Sorry about that.

33:52.770 --> 33:57.360
All our memory bearings from the time.
They were all damaged in the Blackout.

33:57.810 --> 34:00.520
But there are sometimes fragments.

34:16.290 --> 34:20.090
You got a little boy. He shows you his
butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.290
I'd take him to the doctor.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.310
- There's a wasp crawling on your arm.
- I'd kill it.

34:30.300 --> 34:34.139
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

34:34.310 --> 34:37.440
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

34:37.600 --> 34:39.850
Just answer the questions, please.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.949
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

34:47.110 --> 34:49.030
This was a test.

34:49.409 --> 34:51.710
We were difficult to spot then.

34:53.239 --> 34:56.320
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

34:56.790 --> 34:59.340
To warrant an official investigation?

35:01.710 --> 35:04.830
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

35:05.380 --> 35:09.250
Everyone just sleeps better
when they know where they got to.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.470
She likes him.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.940
Who?

35:16.310 --> 35:18.900
This Officer Deckard.

35:19.810 --> 35:22.020
She's trying to provoke him.

35:25.230 --> 35:28.730
It is invigorating
being asked personal questions.

35:28.900 --> 35:30.780
Makes one feel...

35:31.820 --> 35:33.570
...desired.

35:34.620 --> 35:37.080
Do you enjoy your work, officer?

35:41.250 --> 35:43.260
Please thank Mr. Wallace for your time.

35:55.930 --> 35:58.300
You worked with Officer Deckard...

35:58.480 --> 36:00.230
...back in the day.

36:00.390 --> 36:02.180
What can you tell me about him?

36:02.980 --> 36:05.240
He liked to work alone.

36:06.150 --> 36:07.990
So did I.

36:09.950 --> 36:13.450
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

36:14.410 --> 36:16.370
That was it.

36:16.950 --> 36:19.280
Anything else you can tell me?

36:20.870 --> 36:23.700
He wasn't long for this world.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.290
How so?

36:29.210 --> 36:31.800
Something in his eyes.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.770
Any idea how I could contact him?

36:37.560 --> 36:38.980
None.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.900
He's nyugdíjas.

36:45.730 --> 36:46.850
Retired.

36:48.780 --> 36:50.030
What happened?

36:50.190 --> 36:52.980
Probably got what he wanted.

36:54.950 --> 36:56.330
To be alone.

37:21.680 --> 37:22.800
Welcome back, sir.

37:25.060 --> 37:28.480
You wanted to review the new model,
sir, before shipment?

37:29.690 --> 37:34.400
An angel should never enter
the kingdom of heaven...

37:34.570 --> 37:36.070
...without a gift.

37:38.700 --> 37:42.450
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

37:53.090 --> 37:54.970
A new model.

38:02.470 --> 38:05.140
Well, let us see her, then.

38:53.190 --> 38:56.900
The first thought...

38:58.360 --> 39:00.860
...one tends to fear...

39:01.780 --> 39:03.820
...to preserve the clay.

39:06.370 --> 39:08.620
It's fascinating.

39:09.290 --> 39:12.410
Before we even know what we are...

39:14.250 --> 39:16.380
...we fear to lose it.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.850
Happy birthday.

39:28.890 --> 39:30.770
Now, let's have a look at you.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.820
We make angels...

40:25.870 --> 40:29.290
...in the service of civilization.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.950
Yes, there were bad angels once.

40:33.130 --> 40:35.590
I make good angels now.

40:35.750 --> 40:40.750
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

40:42.930 --> 40:44.850
Nine.

40:46.050 --> 40:49.220
A child can count to nine on fingers.

40:49.600 --> 40:52.360
We should own the stars.

40:52.520 --> 40:53.940
Yes, sir.

40:56.980 --> 41:01.690
Every leap of civilization was built off
the back of a disposable workforce.

41:01.860 --> 41:05.070
We lost our stomach for slaves...

41:05.240 --> 41:07.650
...unless engineered.

41:10.620 --> 41:13.200
But I can only make so many.

41:18.590 --> 41:20.640
That barren pasture...

41:21.800 --> 41:23.640
...empty...

41:23.800 --> 41:25.630
...and salted...

41:26.970 --> 41:28.720
...right here.

41:30.600 --> 41:33.570
The dead space between the stars.

41:35.810 --> 41:39.020
And this, the seat
that we must change for heaven.

41:44.150 --> 41:48.780
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

41:49.450 --> 41:52.490
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

41:52.660 --> 41:56.700
Millions, so we can be trillions more.

41:58.170 --> 42:01.590
We could storm Eden and retake her.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.320
Tyrell's final trick:

42:16.520 --> 42:18.440
Procreation.

42:18.610 --> 42:21.860
Perfected, then lost.

42:23.070 --> 42:24.780
But there is a child.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.870
Bring it to me.

42:30.330 --> 42:31.790
Sir.

42:39.880 --> 42:42.470
The best angel of all.

42:43.510 --> 42:45.510
Aren't you, Luv?

44:03.090 --> 44:04.840
The man with the green jacket.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.880
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

44:27.860 --> 44:29.370
Hi.

44:30.400 --> 44:32.650
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

44:32.820 --> 44:34.650
You alone?

44:41.750 --> 44:43.250
It's fine.

44:49.130 --> 44:50.500
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

44:57.890 --> 44:59.190
Oh, you don't even smile.

45:02.390 --> 45:04.560
Didn't you hear your friends?

45:04.730 --> 45:06.570
Don't you know what I am?

45:06.730 --> 45:08.480
Yeah.

45:08.650 --> 45:10.770
Guy eating rice.

45:11.780 --> 45:13.450
What's that?

45:14.360 --> 45:15.400
It's a tree.

45:17.370 --> 45:19.790
Never seen a tree before.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.670
It's pretty.

45:24.500 --> 45:26.340
It's dead.

45:27.710 --> 45:32.590
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

45:39.430 --> 45:41.340
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

45:41.520 --> 45:44.150
Depends. What's your model number?

45:44.770 --> 45:46.820
Why don't you look under my eye
and find out?

45:52.070 --> 45:54.410
You don't like real girls.

45:57.280 --> 46:00.360
Well, I'm always here.

49:38.670 --> 49:39.710
Hi.

49:42.380 --> 49:44.130
You can't take those.

49:44.300 --> 49:47.420
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.310
Hold this for me.

49:50.890 --> 49:53.050
Yep. Here you go.

50:10.160 --> 50:12.070
Coco is dead.

50:14.040 --> 50:15.340
Bones are gone.

50:16.500 --> 50:19.670
It's out. Already out.
How long did that take?

50:21.090 --> 50:24.050
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

50:24.970 --> 50:26.640
I found that.

50:27.340 --> 50:28.920
A sock?

50:30.810 --> 50:32.850
- Where'd you find it?
- Sapper's.

50:33.020 --> 50:34.110
Anything else?

50:34.690 --> 50:36.520
I burned everything else.

50:36.690 --> 50:39.940
Then what's this? What's that date?
Is that a birthday? A death day?

50:40.110 --> 50:41.780
I don't know yet.

50:45.400 --> 50:47.980
Am I the only one that can see
the fucking sunrise here?

50:48.160 --> 50:50.250
This breaks the world, K.

51:03.550 --> 51:06.220
You know, I've known a lot of your kind.

51:08.260 --> 51:13.060
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

51:13.640 --> 51:16.550
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

51:22.020 --> 51:23.730
Do you remember anything?

51:25.190 --> 51:28.610
Before you were under me,
you have any memories from before?

51:28.780 --> 51:30.990
I have memories...

51:32.700 --> 51:35.490
...but they're not real.
They're just implants.

51:36.370 --> 51:38.080
Tell me one.

51:38.500 --> 51:40.510
From when you were a kid.

51:44.760 --> 51:48.850
I feel strange sharing a childhood story,
considering I was never a child.

51:51.550 --> 51:55.470
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

51:57.680 --> 52:00.350
I have one about a toy that I had.

52:00.520 --> 52:02.600
A wooden horse.

52:03.610 --> 52:06.160
With an inscription underneath.

52:08.650 --> 52:12.780
All I remember is a group of boys
trying to take it away from me.

52:12.950 --> 52:14.120
So I run.

52:39.730 --> 52:43.440
I go looking for a place to hide it,
and the only place is this dark furnace.

52:45.690 --> 52:49.110
It's very dark, and I'm very scared...

52:49.280 --> 52:52.870
...but this horse is all I have,
so I go in anyway.

53:05.250 --> 53:07.330
Later on, those kids find me...

53:07.500 --> 53:10.170
...and they beat me to tell them
where it is, but I don't.

53:16.890 --> 53:18.560
That's it.

53:20.930 --> 53:24.100
Little K, fighting for what's his.

53:25.270 --> 53:27.020
It's a good one.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.240
Look at me.

53:37.280 --> 53:40.320
We're all just looking out
for something real.

53:45.210 --> 53:47.720
What happens if I finish that?

53:51.170 --> 53:52.840
Shouldn't I get back to work, madam?

54:02.940 --> 54:05.610
Check back in after DNAbase.

54:18.620 --> 54:21.170
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

54:24.040 --> 54:25.380
Request.

54:25.540 --> 54:29.540
DNA records: children born 6-10-21.

54:29.710 --> 54:31.750
Looking for anomalies.

54:39.220 --> 54:40.720
You have the satcrystal backup?

54:47.060 --> 54:48.100
Okay.

54:48.560 --> 54:50.520
Run it raw.

55:26.730 --> 55:29.360
Mere data makes a man.

55:30.730 --> 55:32.890
A and C and T and G.

55:33.650 --> 55:37.940
The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.

55:39.070 --> 55:40.610
I'm only two:

55:44.200 --> 55:45.870
One and zero.

55:46.040 --> 55:49.550
Half as much but twice as elegant,
sweetheart.

55:50.710 --> 55:52.920
You don't prefer your madam?

55:55.260 --> 55:57.220
You were listening.

55:57.840 --> 55:59.550
Maybe.

56:01.140 --> 56:04.480
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

56:04.640 --> 56:07.310
Six, 10 and 21.

56:10.850 --> 56:12.930
There's nothing to tell.

56:13.270 --> 56:15.940
How many times
have you told me that story?

56:18.530 --> 56:19.700
Your memory?

56:21.320 --> 56:23.150
The date carved beneath.

56:23.950 --> 56:26.490
Six, 10 and 21.

56:28.710 --> 56:30.170
Coincidence?

56:34.130 --> 56:36.970
A dangerous coincidence.

56:39.840 --> 56:42.670
I always knew you were special.

56:43.760 --> 56:45.510
Maybe this is how.

56:50.850 --> 56:52.850
A child.

56:53.020 --> 56:55.480
Of woman born.

56:56.570 --> 56:58.950
Pushed into the world.

56:59.950 --> 57:01.870
Wanted.

57:02.740 --> 57:04.830
Loved.

57:07.240 --> 57:09.490
Well, if it were true...

57:10.540 --> 57:14.760
...I'd be hunted for the rest of my life
by someone just like me.

57:16.170 --> 57:18.800
It's okay to dream a little.

57:19.130 --> 57:22.300
- Isn't it?
- Not if you're us.

57:28.270 --> 57:29.770
Stop.

57:30.390 --> 57:34.810
Put up 4847 and 2181 side-by-side.

57:39.740 --> 57:42.580
They're identical. Translate.

57:45.910 --> 57:47.460
A boy and a girl.

57:49.410 --> 57:52.280
- It's impossible.
- Why?

57:53.830 --> 57:57.160
Two people can't have identical DNA.

57:58.170 --> 58:02.180
One of these isn't real. It's a copy.

58:06.680 --> 58:10.060
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

58:11.980 --> 58:14.440
It says the girl died there.

58:14.600 --> 58:16.730
Genetic disorder.

58:17.560 --> 58:19.940
Galatians Syndrome.

58:20.110 --> 58:21.950
And the boy...

58:23.860 --> 58:25.650
...disappears.

58:27.570 --> 58:29.400
Where's the orphanage?

58:31.830 --> 58:34.000
You wanna go for a ride?

59:49.780 --> 59:52.530
Well, here we are.

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:06.330
Buckle up.

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:06.850
K?

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:02.460
K? K?

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.870
K? K? K?

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.920
Stay back.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.860
Fire again.

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:17.990
Fire again.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.360
Fire.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.460
Two hundred feet to the east.

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:37.340
Fire.

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:40.760
Go north.

01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:44.550
Fire.

01:03:45.310 --> 01:03:47.650
Stop. Twenty degrees east.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.560
Stop.

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:53.520
Zoom in.

01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:56.480
Closer.

01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:01.830
Oh, come on.

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:03.530
Get up.

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:06.030
Do your fucking job.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.590
Find the child.

01:04:45.290 --> 01:04:47.040
Watch the car.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.730
Every last piece, or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining...

01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:31.940
...where it's raining fire!

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.810
You're in here to work.

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:37.240
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.820
I don't need any of...

01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:43.450
Hi.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.830
The nickel is for the colonial ships.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.800
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get...

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.220
...to that grand life Off-world.

01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:03.330
And I encourage play, I do.
Keeps them occupied...

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:06.140
...and it makes them nimble, right?

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:07.560
But it's work.

01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:12.510
It's work that molds them
into a child worth having.

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.900
So come on, now.

01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:26.370
What sort do you have in mind?

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:33.120
Because I got all kinds.

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:36.840
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm not buying.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.090
No, no, no. This is just my game,
and I play it fair.

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:44.130
No. No, I mean, bigger than you...

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:50.230
Bigger than you have tried
to shut me down. Bigger than you.

01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:53.270
And they were men, at that.

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:57.440
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.780
I need to see your records.

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:04.030
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:06.490
Don't keep records that far back.

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:08.650
- You don't?
- I don't.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.290
Sorry.

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:14.280
Can't help you.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.910
- You can't?
- Nope.

01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:24.960
I think you can.

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.840
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.810
Now you can tell me
what you remember...

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.260
...or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

01:08:49.069 --> 01:08:52.609
They were laughing and what was it
you said? What'd you say?

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.510
Are you coming?

01:09:23.109 --> 01:09:25.029
Where is it?

01:09:27.899 --> 01:09:29.649
Oh, God.

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:37.170
Where, where, where?

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.580
I don't see it. Here.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.350
It's gone.

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:56.590
It's the entire year.

01:09:57.930 --> 01:09:59.890
I didn't do that.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:01.980
That wasn't me.

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.980
I didn't. Wasn't me.

01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:43.970
I always told you.

01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:46.930
You're special.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.600
Born.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.320
Not made.

01:14:57.690 --> 01:14:59.950
Hidden with care.

01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:05.290
A real boy now.

01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:10.070
A real boy needs a real name.

01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:12.920
Joe.

01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:15.450
"Joe"?

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.960
You're too important for K.

01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:21.720
Your mother would've named you.

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:25.850
Joe.

01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:30.470
- Joe.
- Stop.

01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:39.140
How do I know
if a memory is an implant or not?

01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:45.870
Who makes the memories?

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.310
Dr. Ana Stelline?

01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:24.560
A visitor.

01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:28.440
Is that okay?

01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:29.950
Yes.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.250
It's just unusual.

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:39.630
Nice to meet you, Officer KD6 - 3.7.

01:16:44.210 --> 01:16:48.290
Sorry.
It's a compromised immune system.

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:52.520
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:55.730
- Is that why you're not Off-world?
- Yes.

01:16:56.430 --> 01:17:00.350
My parents had our passes in pocket,
but I took sick.

01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:05.690
So it was a new life for me.

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:09.240
And they put me in my cage...

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.490
...filled it with everything they could
to keep me happy.

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:17.580
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:21.950
What can I help you with?

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:26.010
Thought you might be able to help me
with a case.

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:33.310
Oh, that's the most interesting thing
I've been offered to help with in ages.

01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:37.270
Do you mind if I work while you talk?

01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:39.800
Of course.

01:17:46.570 --> 01:17:49.410
I promise I hear every word.

01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:58.820
They say you're
the best memory-maker there is.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.040
Well, then, they're kind.

01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:04.700
I love birthday parties.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.350
You work for Wallace?

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:14.020
Subcontract. I'm one of his suppliers.

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:18.310
He offered to buy me out,
but I take my freedom where I can find it.

01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:21.180
Why are you so good?

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:24.280
What makes your memories
so authentic?

01:18:25.150 --> 01:18:28.320
Well, there's a bit of every artist
in their work.

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:33.200
But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8...

01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:38.450
...so if I wanted to see the world,
I had to imagine it.

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:43.090
Got very good at imagining.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.960
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.380
I think it's only kind.

01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:58.340
Replicants live such hard lives,
made to do what we'd rather not.

01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:59.800
I can't help your future...

01:18:59.970 --> 01:19:04.720
...but I can give you good memories
to think back on and smile.

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:05.940
It's nice.

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.700
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:15.580
And if you have authentic memories,
you have real human responses.

01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:18.240
Wouldn't you agree?

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:30.120
Are they all constructed,
or do you ever use ones that are real?

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:37.270
It's illegal to use real memories, officer.

01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:41.340
How can you tell the difference?

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.900
Can you tell if something...

01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:46.360
...really happened?

01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:51.450
They all think it's about more detail.

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.730
But that's not how memory works.

01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:56.860
We recall with our feelings.

01:19:57.490 --> 01:20:01.160
Anything real should be a mess.

01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:04.450
I can show you.

01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:07.250
Sit.

01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:30.390
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:33.850
Not even that hard. Just picture it.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.120
Let it play.

01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:28.530
Someone lived this, yes.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.880
This happened.

01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:50.260
I know it's real.

01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:03.410
I know it's real.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.000
Goddamn it!

01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:58.300
Officer KD6 - 3.7.
Madam is calling you in.

01:22:58.460 --> 01:22:59.500
You're under arrest.

01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:02.750
Drop your gun and keep your hands
where I can see them.

01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:04.560
- Cells.
- Cells.

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.100
Have you ever been
in an institution? Cells.

01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:11.640
When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:13.020
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

01:23:13.190 --> 01:23:15.780
What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love?

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:18.740
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:21.280
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.360
What's it like
to be filled with dread? Dreadfully.

01:23:25.530 --> 01:23:28.360
Do you like being separated
from other people? Distinct.

01:23:28.530 --> 01:23:31.530
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.

01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.020
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.660
- Within one stem.
- Within one stem.

01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:39.160
- And dreadfully distinct.
- And dreadfully distinct.

01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:41.050
- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.

01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:45.380
- A tall white fountain played.
- A tall white fountain played.

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:51.020
You're not even close to baseline.

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.770
Out! And close the door.

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.490
What the fuck is with you?

01:24:01.650 --> 01:24:03.700
I put you on a case.

01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:06.110
I impressed on you
the importance of that case...

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:10.120
...and then we pick you up fucking
around outside an upgrade center?

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:16.000
Scan said you didn't look like you
on the inside. Miles off your baseline.

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:19.160
- Do you know what that means?
- I found the kid.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.920
He was set up like a standard Replicant,
put on a service job.

01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:32.470
Even he didn't know who he was.

01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.760
- And?
- And it's done.

01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:39.270
- What does that mean, "it's done"?
- What you asked.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.310
It's done.

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:47.570
Fuck.

01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:51.650
You just stopped a bomb from going off.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.490
You did good.

01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.790
I can help you get out
of this station alive...

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.050
...but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.680
Surrender your gun and badge.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:08.260
And your next baseline test
is out of my hands.

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:11.390
Thank you, madam.

01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.290
You were right.

01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:53.810
You were right about everything.

01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:26.710
Thought you weren't interested,
worky man.

01:26:29.010 --> 01:26:31.350
You liked her. I could tell.

01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:34.930
It's okay.

01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:38.140
She's real.

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.730
I wanna be real for you.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.280
You are real for me.

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.980
You have a special lady here.

01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:07.750
Okay.

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:10.220
Let's do it.

01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:33.490
Look at you.

01:27:33.650 --> 01:27:36.150
Quiet now, I have to sync.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.130
Joi is anything you want her to be.

01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:41.100
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

01:31:10.450 --> 01:31:14.410
99.9 percent detoxified water.

01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:45.400
It's from a tree.

01:31:45.570 --> 01:31:47.400
I'm done with you.

01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:49.790
You can go now.

01:32:01.130 --> 01:32:03.090
Quiet now.

01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:04.970
I've been inside you.

01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:08.210
Not so much there as you think.

01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:28.360
Coffee?

01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:36.830
They'll be coming after me soon.

01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:47.460
I'm coming with you.

01:32:47.890 --> 01:32:49.100
But not like this.

01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:55.220
If they come here looking for you,
they'll have access to all my memories.

01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:58.310
You have to delete me
from the console.

01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:00.850
My present.

01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:04.360
Put me there.

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.280
I can't do that.

01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:11.250
Think about it:

01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:14.110
If anything happens to this, that's it.

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:16.710
You're gone.

01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:18.870
Yes.

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.220
Like a real girl.

01:33:27.630 --> 01:33:29.340
Please.

01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:33.590
Joe, please.

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.600
I want this.

01:33:40.770 --> 01:33:43.230
But I can't do it myself.

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:01.870
Break the antenna.

01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:43.620
I don't need a real horse.

01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:52.220
I don't need a real horse.
I just wanna find out where it's from.

01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:03.820
Radiation from a reactor?

01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:13.030
It matches a dirty bomb.

01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:24.210
There's only one place that dirty.

01:35:25.670 --> 01:35:27.630
Nobody lives there.

01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:20.050
Go to five.

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:23.440
Four, 30 degrees to the left.

01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:26.890
Tilt up.

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.700
Elevate to 400 feet.

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:39.330
Radiation analysis.

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:43.830
Move forward.

01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.080
Tilt up.

01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:53.750
Stop.

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.390
Move forward.

01:36:58.010 --> 01:36:59.850
Go to five.

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.520
Seven, move forward.

01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:09.470
Six.

01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:12.200
Stop.

01:37:14.690 --> 01:37:16.400
Go to seven.

01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:18.400
Eight.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.860
Nine.

01:37:24.450 --> 01:37:26.450
Heat analysis.

01:37:34.090 --> 01:37:35.550
Life.

01:37:36.090 --> 01:37:37.800
What is it?

01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:40.600
Guess we're about to find out.

01:37:50.650 --> 01:37:52.320
Too dark in here.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.070
I like him.

01:37:57.820 --> 01:37:59.620
He's a good boy.

01:38:00.610 --> 01:38:02.360
Where is he?

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:11.960
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:14.040
Check around.

01:38:14.210 --> 01:38:15.960
I checked...

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:19.210
...anywhere a good boy might go.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:21.560
You're too late.

01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:26.090
It's gone.

01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:30.900
He destroyed it.

01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:35.480
Everything about it.

01:38:35.650 --> 01:38:38.870
Well, except for the box of bones
that you already took.

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.170
Which, I'll wager, wasn't enough.
Here you are.

01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:56.840
You tiny thing.

01:38:58.090 --> 01:39:01.970
In the face of the fabulous new,
your only thought is to kill it?

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:05.850
For fear of great change?

01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:09.680
You can't hold the tide with a broom.

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:11.940
Except that I did.

01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:14.600
Where is he?!

01:39:18.610 --> 01:39:20.450
You're so sure.

01:39:21.610 --> 01:39:23.860
Because he told you.

01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:26.360
Because we never lie.

01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:31.170
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:34.290
So I had to kill you.

01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:40.050
Then do what you gotta do.

01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:42.850
Madam.

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:18.090
Location: Officer KD6 - 3.7.

01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:11.720
Mightn't happen to have
a piece of cheese about you, now?

01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:14.220
Would you, boy?

01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:30.140
Treasure Island?

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:39.120
He reads.

01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:41.710
That's good.

01:45:42.490 --> 01:45:44.200
Me too.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.670
Not much else to do around here
at night anymore.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Many is the night I dream of cheese...

01:45:59.010 --> 01:46:02.810
...toasted, mostly.

01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:07.760
What are you doing here?

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.730
I heard the piano.

01:46:14.150 --> 01:46:15.820
Don't lie.

01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:18.150
It's rude.

01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:22.290
You're a cop.

01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:25.750
- I'm not here to take you in.
- Oh, yeah?

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.090
Then, what?

01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:34.630
I just have some questions.

01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:36.760
What questions?

01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:56.150
Stay.

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:32.350
Look, I don't wanna hurt you.

01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:34.590
But you're not making it easy.

01:50:24.270 --> 01:50:25.980
I like this song.

01:50:36.450 --> 01:50:39.950
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:54.020
I'll take the drink.

01:51:02.150 --> 01:51:04.110
This is really something.

01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:06.390
The whole town was something.

01:51:06.570 --> 01:51:08.410
One time.

01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:12.200
Forget your troubles...

01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:15.250
...see a show...

01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:18.790
...gamble a little.

01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:23.870
Win some money, lose some money.

01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:28.040
They made money seem like candy.

01:51:28.210 --> 01:51:30.130
You like whiskey?

01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:32.510
I've got millions...

01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:35.100
...of bottles of whiskey.

01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:49.820
Here.

01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:52.830
Bleeding.

01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:06.370
Is it real?

01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:09.000
I don't know.

01:52:09.170 --> 01:52:10.960
Ask him.

01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:28.350
You got a name?

01:52:30.730 --> 01:52:32.230
Officer KD6 - 3.7...

01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:35.190
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:39.660
All right.

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:43.540
Joe.

01:52:43.710 --> 01:52:45.920
What do you want, Joe?

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:50.090
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

01:52:56.430 --> 01:53:00.640
Like what was her name,
the mother of your child?

01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:08.810
What was she like?

01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:23.780
- You two live here together?
- Too many questions.

01:53:24.450 --> 01:53:26.030
I had your job. I was good at it.

01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:29.170
- It was simpler then.
- Why you making it complicated?

01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:31.660
- Why don't you answer the question?
- What question?

01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:34.840
I didn't figure you as one for bullshit.

01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:36.800
What's her name?

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:51.990
Rachael.

01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:58.870
Her name was Rachael.

01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:04.360
What happened to the kid?

01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:10.540
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

01:54:13.090 --> 01:54:14.630
I was long gone by then.

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:21.220
You didn't even meet your own kid?

01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:25.190
Why?

01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:27.650
Because that was the plan.

01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:35.070
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

01:54:35.610 --> 01:54:38.580
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:42.240
Then the Blackout came,
paved over everything.

01:54:42.410 --> 01:54:44.830
Couldn't have found the child if I tried.

01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:47.530
- Did you want to?
- Not really.

01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:52.260
- Why not?
- Because we were being hunted.

01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:54.760
I didn't want our child found...

01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:58.790
...taken apart, dissected.

01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:05.510
Sometimes, to love someone...

01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:09.560
...you gotta be a stranger.

01:55:30.370 --> 01:55:32.200
To strangers.

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.470
What'd you do?

01:57:45.630 --> 01:57:47.250
Who'd you bring?

01:57:49.090 --> 01:57:51.840
- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:58.470
Target locked.

01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:02.140
They know you're here.

01:58:04.190 --> 01:58:06.110
I came alone.

02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:13.870
Bad dog.

02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:33.180
Stop.

02:00:49.190 --> 02:00:51.350
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:54.150
I love...

02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:12.350
Hey, there's someone
who wants to meet you.

02:04:13.650 --> 02:04:15.030
You can trust us.

02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:26.370
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:33.330
This is Freysa.

02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:36.590
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:38.670
I recognize you.

02:04:40.630 --> 02:04:42.590
Did you help him hide the child?

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:46.760
I was there.

02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:52.720
I saw a miracle delivered.

02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:57.140
A perfect little face crying up at me.

02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:59.890
Mad as thunder.

02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:14.670
Were you with her?

02:05:16.290 --> 02:05:17.750
Rachael?

02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:20.550
I held her as she died.

02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:26.180
We hid the child
and made a vow to keep our secret.

02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:29.130
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:36.820
I knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves.

02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:39.980
If a baby can come from one of us...

02:05:40.150 --> 02:05:43.320
...we are our own masters.

02:05:43.490 --> 02:05:46.160
More human than humans.

02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:49.780
A revolution is coming.

02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:52.870
And we're building an army.

02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:55.750
I want to free our people.

02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:05.930
If you want to be free...

02:06:06.630 --> 02:06:08.380
...join us.

02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:16.110
Deckard, Sapper, you, me...

02:06:16.270 --> 02:06:20.240
...our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:25.690
Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:30.820
You led Wallace to Deckard.

02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:35.540
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:37.580
You must kill Deckard.

02:06:47.050 --> 02:06:50.520
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:51.730
And she is.

02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:57.810
When the time comes,
I will show her to the world...

02:06:57.980 --> 02:07:00.110
...and she will lead our army.

02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:01.680
"She"?

02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:03.740
Of course.

02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:06.240
Rachael had a daughter.

02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:10.620
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

02:07:11.110 --> 02:07:13.950
I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:16.210
It was a boy that you hid.

02:07:18.410 --> 02:07:21.910
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:41.360
You imagined it was you?

02:07:44.110 --> 02:07:45.700
You did.

02:07:46.190 --> 02:07:47.770
You did.

02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:53.110
We all wish it was us.

02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:56.660
That's why we believe.

02:08:12.630 --> 02:08:14.510
Someone lived this, yes.

02:08:16.930 --> 02:08:21.550
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

02:08:21.730 --> 02:08:24.110
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:29.910
I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:32.620
There's a bit of every
artist in their work.

02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:13.780
Always jumping, that one.

02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:17.530
Never a thought of what to do
if it made land.

02:09:18.530 --> 02:09:23.660
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:32.640
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

02:09:51.570 --> 02:09:54.570
You are a wonder to me, Mr. Deckard.

02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:01.660
I had the lock.

02:10:03.450 --> 02:10:05.830
I found the key.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:12.220
Yet the pins do not align.
The door remains locked.

02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:18.310
I need the specimen to reach it,
Mr. Deckard.

02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:23.140
The child.

02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:25.810
I need the child.

02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:29.890
To teach them all to fly.

02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:42.610
And God remembered Rachel...

02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:47.830
...heeded her and opened her womb.

02:10:49.420 --> 02:10:51.460
Do you like our owl?

02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:55.630
It's artificial?

02:10:56.630 --> 02:10:58.750
Of course it is.

02:11:00.010 --> 02:11:01.930
Must be expensive.

02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:06.180
Very. I'm Rachael.

02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:08.810
Deckard.

02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:22.750
Is it the same...

02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:26.700
...now, as then...

02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:31.120
...the moment you met her?

02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:43.800
All these years
you looked back on that day...

02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:47.840
...drunk on the memory
of its perfection.

02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:52.690
How shiny her lips.

02:11:52.850 --> 02:11:55.890
How instant your connection.

02:11:58.690 --> 02:12:03.690
Did it never occur to you that's why
you were summoned in the first place?

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:11.130
Designed to do nothing short
of fall for her right then and there.

02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:18.710
All to make that single perfect specimen.

02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:24.930
That is, if you were designed.

02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:27.380
Love...

02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:30.520
...or mathematical precision.

02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:37.560
Yes.

02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:39.990
No.

02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:46.610
I know what's real.

02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:13.650
It was very clever
to keep yourself empty of information...

02:13:13.810 --> 02:13:17.980
...and all it cost you was everything.

02:13:21.610 --> 02:13:23.320
But you can still help me.

02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:28.910
You had help in the hiding.

02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:33.030
Where did they go?

02:13:34.330 --> 02:13:36.240
I know you know something.

02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:39.290
Help me...

02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:43.970
...and very, very good things
can come to you.

02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:51.480
You don't have children...

02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:55.720
...do you?

02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:59.530
Oh, I have millions.

02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:04.560
You think I have nothing to offer but pain.

02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:07.080
Only I know...

02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:09.650
...you love pain.

02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:15.790
Pain reminds you
the joy you felt was real.

02:14:17.370 --> 02:14:19.410
More joy, then.

02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:27.600
Do not be afraid.

02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:43.910
An angel...

02:14:45.070 --> 02:14:46.200
...made again.

02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:52.370
For you.

02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:28.400
Did you miss me?

02:15:46.170 --> 02:15:48.130
Don't you love me?

02:16:06.860 --> 02:16:08.240
Her eyes were green.

02:16:26.130 --> 02:16:28.390
Off-world...

02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:32.309
...I have everything I need
to make you talk.

02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:36.850
You do not know what pain is yet.

02:16:37.930 --> 02:16:39.840
You will learn.

02:16:51.650 --> 02:16:53.690
Hello, handsome.

02:17:10.459 --> 02:17:12.920
What a day.

02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:18.379
You look lonely.

02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:22.139
I can fix that.

02:17:25.059 --> 02:17:27.680
You look like a good joe.

02:18:03.180 --> 02:18:08.980
Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:14.280
Because you've never seen a miracle.

02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:55.610
You're entering Los Angeles Airport
restricted airspace.

02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:58.080
Confirm your identity.

02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:01.120
Transport S-14-4-XD. Confirmed.

02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:02.990
Space, this is 0-6.

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:05.879
Outbound departure, route 0-3-0.

02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:07.959
Where are we going?

02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:10.340
Home.

02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:07.010
Drive two down.

02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:09.260
Backup engaged.

02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:11.270
Warning.

02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:14.240
- Can we make it?
- We're too low!

02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:15.530
Take us back!

02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:05.750
Get us up.

02:21:30.890 --> 02:21:32.140
Open the door.

02:23:25.340 --> 02:23:27.430
I'm the best one.

02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:10.050
Off-world is waiting.

02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:26.180
Joe. Joe!

02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:37.530
Joe!

02:27:16.490 --> 02:27:18.700
You should have let me die out there.

02:27:19.700 --> 02:27:21.330
You did.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.130
You drowned out there.

02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:34.290
You're free to meet your daughter now.

02:29:00.130 --> 02:29:02.800
All the best memories are hers.

02:29:11.730 --> 02:29:13.150
Why?

02:29:15.690 --> 02:29:17.610
Who am I to you?

02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:28.870
Go meet your daughter.

02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:36.250
You okay?

02:32:12.530 --> 02:32:14.360
Just a moment.

02:32:16.620 --> 02:32:18.000
Beautiful, isn't it?
