WEBVTT

00:12.577 --> 00:15.667
Bruce,
where did you just go?

00:15.754 --> 00:18.496
<i>REPORTER : The </i>
USA is in an understandable

00:18.583 --> 00:20.455
<i>state of anxiety.</i>

00:20.542 --> 00:22.718
<i>MAN : This could </i>
be related to terrorism.

00:22.805 --> 00:25.895
Who knows where those
bastards are hiding out,
just find them.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.679
Didn't you say Iraq
doesn't have the Ames strain?

00:27.766 --> 00:29.203
Here's a copy of
what I faxed to your office.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.205
Happy to help.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.120
We found that something
have been added to the spores.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.512
How certain are you
about what that substance is?

00:34.599 --> 00:35.687
Bentonite?

00:35.774 --> 00:38.255
100%.

00:38.342 --> 00:39.996
There's only
one county we know of that's
added Bentonite to anthrax.

00:40.083 --> 00:42.259
If we go for Saddam,
will we even get Al-Qaeda?

00:42.346 --> 00:43.782
All the terrorists
who did all this?

00:45.958 --> 00:48.309
So tell me more
about your lone wolf theory.

00:48.396 --> 00:52.226
All signs point
to our perp being a highly
educated American citizen

00:52.313 --> 00:54.358
with scientific expertise,

00:54.445 --> 00:57.361
most likely
works in isolation,
suffers from mental illness.

01:00.190 --> 01:04.064
I drew up this profile
to send to the American
Society of Microbiology.

01:04.151 --> 01:06.675
What if the
anthrax killer is one of us?

01:06.762 --> 01:08.851
You did
a real service for
your country, Dr. Ivins.

01:08.938 --> 01:11.071
It's an honor, sir.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.594
Things are good.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.236
Boss, hey.

01:46.323 --> 01:49.935
Jesus. Are you
already out running?

01:50.022 --> 01:52.547
It's not even 6:00.
I was gonna leave a message.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.463
<i>RYKER : </i>
Yeah, well I haven't been
getting much sleep lately.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.682
Actually,
none of my team has.

01:57.769 --> 02:00.990
I got them out swabbing
mailboxes all around
the clock in Jersey.

02:01.077 --> 02:05.125
I was
calling to commend you
on this Bentonite thing.

02:06.387 --> 02:08.345
Uh, Bentonite, what?

02:08.432 --> 02:10.304
<i>COPAK : From </i>
what I understand, Iraq is...

02:10.391 --> 02:12.828
The only country that's
used it in producing anthrax.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.960
Uh, yeah.

02:15.047 --> 02:17.137
Well, that's what
the inspection team
found after the war but.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.790
<i>COPAK : </i>
Yeah, right well...

02:18.877 --> 02:21.184
<i>Your USAMRIID team </i>
just found Bentonite

02:21.271 --> 02:23.143
<i>in the attack spores, </i>
which gives...

02:23.230 --> 02:26.102
Us a direct link
between the letters and Iraq.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.365
<i>COPAK : </i>
Made some people on
the Hill very happy to be

02:28.452 --> 02:30.933
<i>finally getting some </i>
traction on this case.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.370
Did they send
over their results?

02:33.457 --> 02:34.850
<i>COPAK : </i>
No, that's your department.

02:34.937 --> 02:36.678
All I know
is Director Mueller

02:36.765 --> 02:38.984
just assigned us
a major case number.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.030
<i>COPAK : </i>
More teams coming on.

02:41.117 --> 02:44.468
COPAK:
Investigation's officially
been dubbed Amerithrax.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.385
Hey, Ryker...

02:48.472 --> 02:49.691
<i>COPAK : </i>
This is a big win for us.

02:49.778 --> 02:52.128
<i>You've done the Bureau proud.</i>

02:52.215 --> 02:54.652
We're one step
closer to getting weapons
of mass of destruction out

02:54.739 --> 02:56.654
of the hands of terrorists.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.710
Agent Ryker.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.451
Excuse me, Colonel,
but your end run on the Hill

03:10.538 --> 03:13.236
just sent us further down
a path to war with Iraq.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.369
I wanna see this
Bentonite you say you found.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.022
It wasn't me.

03:17.109 --> 03:19.242
Bruce Ivins
is our top anthrax man.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.201
You should've been dealing
with him from the start.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.724
RYKER:
Then I wanna talk to him.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.116
Where is he?

03:24.204 --> 03:25.857
LIVINGSTON:
Bruce is never late.

03:25.944 --> 03:28.382
Something must've come up,
but here's his findings.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.219
You sent info to
the Hill based on one image?

03:39.306 --> 03:40.742
Are you kidding!

03:40.829 --> 03:41.743
It wasn't
just one scientist.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.005
It was vetted.

03:43.092 --> 03:44.920
It wasn't vetted by me.

03:45.007 --> 03:47.488
This is the US Army,
we don't report to the FBI.

03:47.575 --> 03:51.231
And none of us appreciate you
circulating a suspect profile.

03:51.318 --> 03:54.451
Asking our microbiologists
to turn on each other.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.279
Is that the
Bureau's idea of teamwork?

03:56.366 --> 03:58.803
I see what could be
the presence of Bentonite.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.936
But this photo isn't detailed
enough to show whether

04:01.023 --> 04:04.548
the substance is covering
the spores or embedded in them.

04:04.635 --> 04:07.769
Embedded means
someone took an existing
sample out of a lab.

04:07.856 --> 04:10.293
And coated means it was
intentionally manufactured to

04:10.380 --> 04:11.816
be more airborne,

04:11.903 --> 04:13.992
to be a weapon of
mass destruction.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.604
That's what the inspectors
found in Iraq in '92.

04:16.691 --> 04:20.738
But this photo,
it's not conclusive
enough in either direction.

04:20.825 --> 04:23.785
It's the best
picture we can take with
the equipment with have.

04:23.872 --> 04:26.614
Well, before
our soldiers go on
a wild goose chase,

04:26.701 --> 04:28.093
looking for
biological weapons,

04:28.180 --> 04:31.053
I would like
to know for sure.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.838
<i>SOLDIER : When the </i>

a lot of contacts
with counterterrorism.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.671
Good morning.
Nice to see you.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.064
I need to find
someone on the ground in Iraq

06:09.151 --> 06:10.326
in the last five years.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.241
Iraq?
That is a 180.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.764
You're gonna bench
my lone wolf angle?

06:13.851 --> 06:15.200
No, that's
not what I'm doing.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.463
I'm not
pulling my profile.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.378
I'm not asking you to.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.640
Good,
because we've already
got two hits,

06:19.727 --> 06:21.032
one in Texas,
one in Seattle.

06:21.119 --> 06:21.990
I've got field
agents interviewing.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.429
Can you just,
just have a seat or

06:26.516 --> 06:28.213
go get me a cup of
coffee or something?

06:28.300 --> 06:29.693
Look, there's
a chance that the spores

06:29.780 --> 06:32.130
have been weaponized
with Bentonite,

06:32.217 --> 06:33.958
and if that's true,
we're gonna have to
admit to the powers that

06:34.045 --> 06:36.091
be that they know
something more than we do,

06:36.178 --> 06:39.050
which is that Iraq is
harboring biological weapons.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.748
And Al-Qaeda.

06:40.835 --> 06:45.056
Okay, look let's just
say that, that it's true.

06:45.143 --> 06:48.233
You told me that the Ames
strain came from the US.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.975
It did, but it has
been shipped to labs around
the world for research.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.847
How many?

06:52.934 --> 06:54.239
We're still trying
to figure that out exactly,

06:54.326 --> 06:55.632
but who knows how
lax the security

06:55.719 --> 06:58.156
is at any of them?

06:58.243 --> 07:00.637
Some scientists could,
could've been recruited or
even blackmailed by Al-Qaeda.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.378
Who smuggled it
into the Iraq, weaponized it,

07:02.465 --> 07:04.119
brought it into the US,

07:04.206 --> 07:05.686
dropped it in the mail
in New Jersey, I mean,

07:05.773 --> 07:08.602
that sounds, it
sounds a little messy.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.517
I have no agenda.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.170
It's my job just to
follow the science,

07:12.257 --> 07:14.999
which I admit right
now is less than solid.

07:17.349 --> 07:19.526
Okay. All right.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.485
Well, what kind of
"intellectual asset"
are we looking for exactly?

07:22.572 --> 07:25.749
Anyone who was
part of the UN inspection
team after Desert Storm.

07:30.362 --> 07:31.973
Hi.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.975
- You've seen it, right?
- Seen what?

07:34.062 --> 07:36.586
The FBI profile,
the "Anthrax Killer?"

07:36.673 --> 07:39.459
Apparently, they sent
it to everybody in the
microbiology community.

07:48.032 --> 07:50.818
Like we're crazy enough
to work with dry anthrax,

07:50.905 --> 07:53.168
they think we have
a death wish or something.

07:53.255 --> 07:55.475
This is poppycock.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.651
They're treating us
like we're the enemy.

07:57.738 --> 08:00.131
They shouldn't do that.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.786
We're the heroes.
They even said that.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.093
It's gonna make us
all suspicious of each other,

08:05.180 --> 08:08.749
as if this place
isn't tense enough.

08:08.836 --> 08:12.840
You know, Jody,
if anyone tries to tap
our phones or computers,

08:12.927 --> 08:15.364
turn this into
some witch-hunt,

08:15.451 --> 08:16.974
there are ways to
protect ourselves.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.592
Yeah, that is
a good point, but if
you think about it...

08:25.679 --> 08:27.768
Excuse me. Dr. Ruiz?

08:27.855 --> 08:31.336
Gabriel. Please.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.208
Dani spoke highly of you.

08:33.295 --> 08:35.471
Uh, thank you
for taking the time.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.038
She tells me that
you were part of an
inspection team looking for

08:37.125 --> 08:39.257
a bio and chem
weapons in Iraq.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.477
I've been
off the inspection
circuit for a few years,

08:41.564 --> 08:42.957
but I'll give you
whatever help I can.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.698
I appreciate that.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.003
I've got USAMRIID
rattling cages in high places.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.570
Uh, careful now,

08:47.657 --> 08:48.745
I did train under
some of their guys.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.834
Ah.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.662
Well, there are
just a few quick
triggers out there linking

08:52.749 --> 08:54.446
the anthrax attack spores

08:54.534 --> 08:57.232
to Iraq using a shaky
Bentonite connection.

08:57.319 --> 09:03.107
Uh, we did find spores
in the soil less than an
hour's drive from Baghdad.

09:03.194 --> 09:07.155
And you can confirm
that they used Bentonite
to aerosolize the powder?

09:07.242 --> 09:09.766
Bacillus thuringiensis.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.376
Claimed they coated
the anthrax with it

09:11.463 --> 09:13.770
to make it easily
dispersible "Insecticide,"

09:13.857 --> 09:16.164
but we all know that just
made it highly airborne,

09:16.251 --> 09:17.818
deadly as hell.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.428
Huh.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.125
But Iraq never had
the Ames strain, right?

09:21.212 --> 09:24.128
- Never.
- Okay.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.739
So, then, what are the
chances that the Iraqis

09:25.826 --> 09:28.350
somehow got their hands
on Ames and then,

09:28.437 --> 09:32.223
used their aerosolizing
process to weaponize it?

09:32.310 --> 09:37.664
I guess possible
in theory, but the obvious
question is why would they

09:37.751 --> 09:41.232
jump through all those
hoops when they already
have their own strain?

09:41.319 --> 09:42.930
The Vollum strain.

09:43.017 --> 09:45.367
That's
what I was thinking.

09:45.454 --> 09:49.327
The problem is none of
that seems to hold water
with the suits on the Hill.

09:49.414 --> 09:53.114
Any other details you
can remember about the
spores you found over there?

09:53.201 --> 09:54.724
I can do
better than that.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.987
I brought back a
little souvenir from Iraq.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.554
It's in the fridge.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.171
All right.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.697
Show time.

10:12.307 --> 10:15.049
Spores from the
Leahy letter on the left,

10:15.136 --> 10:16.877
Iraqi spores on the right.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.367
The powders
are nothing alike.

10:31.021 --> 10:33.589
Sir, the reports
USAMRIID were premature.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.548
The anthrax in the
attack letters did
not come from Iraq.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.333
We need to get
this to the West Wing.

10:38.420 --> 10:41.858
Uh, let's
touch base tomorrow.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.599
Mat, you can't be serious.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.819
It's blasted
all over the media.

10:45.906 --> 10:48.517
An independent
lab confirmed it and I
saw it with my own eyes.

10:48.604 --> 10:51.128
This anthrax strain is
nothing like the one we saw

10:51.215 --> 10:52.652
in Iraq after the war.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.741
Well, if
not Iraq, then who?

10:54.828 --> 10:56.699
I'm hearing a lot
about who didn't give
anthrax to Al-Qaeda.

10:56.786 --> 10:59.136
How about one lead on who did?

10:59.223 --> 11:03.619
Look, there are
probably reasons above my
pay grade to target Iraq.

11:03.706 --> 11:07.405
Yeah, well...
One being that Hussein
is a inhumane dictator.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.625
Absolutely.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.758
But if our troops are
gonna get shipped off to war.

11:11.845 --> 11:14.543
Thin ice, Ryker.

11:14.630 --> 11:17.067
It's not your neck
they'll be coming for

11:17.154 --> 11:19.722
if you turn
out to be wrong.

11:19.809 --> 11:22.812
30 years of crossing
every T, dotting every I...

11:22.899 --> 11:24.771
Then let the
science speak for itself.

11:26.294 --> 11:27.643
Send this up the chain.

12:19.564 --> 12:23.917
I first met
Bruce Ivins at Chapel Hill
25 years ago.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.835
We were doctoral students.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.750
It didn't take me very long

12:30.837 --> 12:35.189
to realize that there was
something different about him.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.668
Hold.

12:40.977 --> 12:41.935
Wow.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.943
Hey, I'm Bruce.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.946
Bruce Ivins.
What's your name?

12:53.033 --> 12:55.035
HAIGWOOD:
And from that moment on,

12:55.122 --> 12:59.256
Bruce was there to
greet me, every day.

12:59.343 --> 13:02.346
So, he was an odd
duck who came on too strong.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.740
That about right?

13:04.827 --> 13:08.222
I got to say, none of
these points to Mr. Ivins
being our anthrax killer.

13:08.309 --> 13:11.399
It's just, I...

13:11.486 --> 13:13.401
Uh, I don't know.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.707
You
called us, remember?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.885
There's
a side to Bruce.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.106
It's, uh, it's not
easy for me to explain.

13:23.193 --> 13:29.330
Um, but it's
an unsettling side that
only a few women have seen.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.421
But I learned to
keep my distance.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.730
I started sneaking
into the lab through
the basement to avoid him.

13:44.649 --> 13:47.174
It didn't work.

13:47.261 --> 13:50.090
Even after I was
married and moved away,

13:50.177 --> 13:52.396
he would drive
by my house at night,

13:52.483 --> 13:54.007
and then one day,

13:54.094 --> 13:56.139
on my way to
work in the morning,

13:56.226 --> 13:59.664
he left me a little surprise.

14:08.586 --> 14:11.372
You don't know what
Bruce is capable of.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.794
Bruce?

14:50.498 --> 14:51.455
Andrew, come on.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.022
Okay.

14:53.109 --> 14:56.286
Amanda, breakfast.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.593
Come on.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.769
- Morning mom.
- Good morning.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.339
Morning.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.514
Hi.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.082
Hi.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.258
Good morning.

15:11.345 --> 15:12.999
How do you
know when you're in
the bathroom in France?

15:14.696 --> 15:17.090
Euro-pean.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.353
Oh, come on.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.311
Did you hear about the
new book on anti-gravity?

15:21.398 --> 15:23.139
- Oh, please dad.
- It's impossible...

15:23.226 --> 15:24.358
Impossible to put down.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.359
Yeah, I heard that.

15:25.446 --> 15:26.882
Mm-hmm.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.492
Okay, nothing yet?

15:28.579 --> 15:30.973
Why don't
cannibals eat clowns?

15:31.060 --> 15:32.453
Huh?

15:32.540 --> 15:33.497
Because they...

15:33.584 --> 15:35.499
Taste funny!

15:35.586 --> 15:36.892
Oh, come on!

15:36.979 --> 15:39.634
Oh, Bruce
broke the eggs.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.941
Sorry, honey.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.507
Another
late-night drive?

15:48.077 --> 15:49.774
Who's hungry?

15:49.861 --> 15:52.603
Do you think I'm
capable of hurting anyone?

15:52.690 --> 15:56.781
Well, that is an
interesting question, Bruce.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.915
Have you been experiencing
any aggressive urges?

16:00.002 --> 16:01.351
Any violent thoughts?

16:01.438 --> 16:02.874
What? No, no.

16:02.962 --> 16:03.963
Gosh.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.270
After
the events of 9/11,

16:07.357 --> 16:10.230
you could, "Barely
contain your anger."

16:10.317 --> 16:15.017
You told me that your
job gave you access to
deadly materials such as,

16:15.104 --> 16:17.977
"Cyanide, to poison
the neighbor's dog,"

16:18.064 --> 16:20.849
and "Ammonium nitrate
to make a bomb."

16:20.936 --> 16:23.286
You wrote that down?

16:23.373 --> 16:25.158
Okay.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.029
I, I wanted you to know how
much trust they put in me.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.378
I wasn't saying
I'd do anything.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.554
I mean...

16:30.641 --> 16:31.903
HALSTROM:
Has this been triggered by
your suspicions regarding

16:31.991 --> 16:33.644
the fellow scientist
that you saw?

16:33.731 --> 16:34.732
No, no, no, no,
no, no, forget what I said.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.908
It wasn't Simon Kurz.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.823
He's just not the guy.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.173
I was mistaken.

16:40.260 --> 16:41.478
I think I was confused,

16:41.565 --> 16:45.134
and I, I, I might have,

16:45.221 --> 16:48.529
I had another one of
those out-of-body experiences.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.792
Describe it for me.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.446
Well, it was
the same as last time.

16:54.709 --> 16:59.322
I get this tingling down
both of my arms, and I'm...

16:59.409 --> 17:00.976
And I get a little dizzy,

17:01.063 --> 17:02.586
and I have this
funny taste in my mouth.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.023
Was it
metallic, the taste?

17:07.243 --> 17:11.117
I found a poem
that I sent to a friend,

17:11.204 --> 17:12.901
but I, I don't
remember writing it.

17:15.121 --> 17:20.169
And the other day, I
was sitting at my desk,

17:22.258 --> 17:23.520
but at the same time,

17:23.607 --> 17:25.131
I was standing
a few feet away,

17:25.218 --> 17:27.307
watching myself work.

17:27.394 --> 17:30.005
It's like I'm
a passenger on the ride
of my own life, you know?

17:34.140 --> 17:36.185
Nothing like living in the
first-person singular and

17:36.272 --> 17:37.839
the third-person singular,
am I right?

17:39.710 --> 17:42.887
Dissociative
experiences are not unusual,

17:42.974 --> 17:45.194
given your aggressive
regimen of medication.

17:47.718 --> 17:51.157
I'm gonna recommend
that we adjust your dosage.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.723
Okay?

17:52.810 --> 17:55.639
Okay. Yeah.

17:55.726 --> 18:00.557
HALSTROM:
Bruce, are you able to confide
these experiences to anyone?

18:02.864 --> 18:04.387
Well, Jody and Mara.

18:04.474 --> 18:07.042
Okay,
Jody is your co-worker?

18:07.129 --> 18:08.261
We share a lab.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.656
Mara was our third amigo.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.528
Till she hot-footed
it off to medical school

18:14.615 --> 18:17.400
and abandoned us.

18:17.487 --> 18:20.751
I tell them things
I'd never tell anyone.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.231
I'm blessed that way.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.065
So, Ivins had
a thing for sorority girls?

18:30.152 --> 18:33.764
He had
a "thing" for the women
of Kappa Kappa Gamma.

18:35.766 --> 18:39.205
Bruce had been rejected by
one of my sorority sisters.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.337
I don't know who.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.906
Maybe she laughed
at him or maybe she
was as nice as can be,

18:44.993 --> 18:46.908
and simply not interested.

18:48.779 --> 18:54.785
Bruce harbored a great
deal of anger toward Kappas.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.439
Wouldn't be
the first college boy to

18:56.526 --> 18:58.441
have crushes on
a house full of young women.

18:58.528 --> 19:00.095
He was a grown man,

19:00.182 --> 19:02.010
a doctoral student,

19:02.097 --> 19:05.274
and he never grew
out of his obsession.

19:05.361 --> 19:08.756
This wasn't
an innocent infatuation.

19:08.843 --> 19:11.628
It was invasive.

19:11.715 --> 19:17.504
Bruce was always pestering
me with questions about
KKG initiation rituals.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.288
He wanted to
get a cypher, he...

19:19.375 --> 19:21.029
A what?

19:21.116 --> 19:23.336
It's a secret
book with a decoding key

19:23.423 --> 19:25.294
for all the KKG rituals.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.209
MCALLISTER:
That's a real thing?

19:27.296 --> 19:28.819
I take it you never
joined a sorority, Agent?

19:30.778 --> 19:37.480
Look, it was as if Bruce
wanted to be one of us.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.875
I was always
shocked by how much he knew
about our secret rituals,

19:40.962 --> 19:45.749
and I never could figure out
where he got his information.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.535
For someone
who claims not to have been
close friends with him,

19:48.622 --> 19:50.624
you sure know
a lot about Mr. Ivins.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.582
He didn't
give me much of a choice.

19:54.018 --> 19:58.153
Bruce can snap just like that,

19:58.240 --> 20:02.288
into a darker
version of himself.

20:02.375 --> 20:05.465
A Bruce that's prone to
secret acts of vengeance

20:05.552 --> 20:07.858
with the most obscure reasons.

20:11.384 --> 20:16.040
One day, my dissertation
notebook went missing.

20:16.127 --> 20:20.741
All of my experiments,
my data for years,

20:20.828 --> 20:24.875
all the work I
desperately needed
to complete my doctorate.

20:24.962 --> 20:26.399
Have you seen
my notebook right there?

20:26.486 --> 20:30.490
It felt as if my life
had been stolen.

20:30.577 --> 20:33.536
I ran from lab to lab
like a crazy person.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.712
No one had seen my notebook.

20:45.069 --> 20:48.072
And then suddenly,
I knew who had it.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.092
- Hi.
- Hello.

21:10.660 --> 21:14.316
My notebook is,
is, uh, missing...

21:14.403 --> 21:15.752
Are you
asking if I took it?

21:15.839 --> 21:17.537
No. No.

21:17.624 --> 21:19.669
Uh, uh, have you seen it?

21:21.802 --> 21:24.065
I would never
betray a KKG sister.

21:26.981 --> 21:29.549
Of course.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.028
Thanks.

21:32.552 --> 21:34.641
Soon the clues
started to come.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.214
One was an acrostic.

21:43.302 --> 21:47.480
A poem in which the
first letter of every line
spelled out a new message.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.482
T, T, E, R.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.310
Oh, I was right.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.268
In this case,
there was a second acrostic

21:53.355 --> 21:55.270
hidden within the first.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.533
Writing down the opening
letters of each line and

21:57.620 --> 21:59.100
then reading them
backward revealed the

21:59.187 --> 22:01.668
"secret location"
of my missing notebook.

22:01.755 --> 22:04.366
Ah, here's something.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.020
Well, is this your notebook?

22:06.107 --> 22:07.717
An anthrax expert,

22:07.804 --> 22:09.980
secret codes,

22:10.067 --> 22:15.421
a man who plays
twisted games with people
using the US mail system?

22:15.508 --> 22:17.684
Does that not
sound familiar to you?

22:33.482 --> 22:34.483
It's positive.

22:34.570 --> 22:35.789
Positive.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.704
Agent Moore! It's positive!

22:40.097 --> 22:41.185
Hey,
excuse me, please, stop.

22:41.272 --> 22:42.709
We need to clear the area.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.188
Just move across the
street here, people.

22:44.275 --> 22:45.625
Just cross the street, please.

22:45.712 --> 22:46.843
Thank you very much.

22:51.239 --> 22:54.808
<i>PRESIDENT BUSH : </i>
I don't have knowledge
of a direct link

22:54.895 --> 23:00.466
<i>of the anthrax incidents </i>
to, uh, to the enemy.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.819
<i>But I wouldn't </i>
put it past them.

23:05.906 --> 23:08.648
"I wouldn't
put it past them."

23:08.735 --> 23:10.345
He's talking about
the Bentonite in Iraq?

23:10.432 --> 23:12.173
Who knows.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.131
What about the
research you did with Ruiz?

23:14.218 --> 23:15.655
Didn't you push
that up the ladder?

23:15.742 --> 23:17.308
Copak passed it on,

23:17.396 --> 23:19.876
but clearly, it didn't
get enough traction.

23:19.963 --> 23:23.402
We can just put Ruiz
in front of the press here
and prove them wrong.

23:23.489 --> 23:28.015
No. See, the thing is,
all the scientists had to sign
a non-disclosure agreement.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.931
Ryker.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.236
<i>MOORE : </i>
We found the mailbox.

23:34.108 --> 23:35.849
How sure are you
it's the one our killer used?

23:35.936 --> 23:37.981
It's the only
one that tested positive.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.505
<i>RYKER : </i>
Where is it?

23:39.592 --> 23:41.289
Uh, 10 Nassau Street.

23:41.376 --> 23:43.596
It's about a block from
the entrance to Princeton.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.380
<i>RYKER : </i>
Any security cameras
on that street?

23:45.467 --> 23:47.295
Uh-uh.

23:47.382 --> 23:48.427
Yeah, there's a bunch all
over the campus, but not here.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.170
The letters, they
have microscopic scratch marks

23:53.257 --> 23:55.608
from the glass
of the photocopier
that the sender used.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.784
<i>TORETTI : </i>
I know this is daunting,
but we need to find...

23:57.871 --> 23:59.699

23:59.786 --> 24:01.309
The libraries, Kinko's,

24:01.396 --> 24:02.615
we can match the
scratches on the glass.

24:02.702 --> 24:05.052
Start canvassing.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.619
<i>RYKER : </i>
Look for any professor
with an axe to grind

24:06.706 --> 24:07.750
<i>who could have given </i>

24:07.837 --> 24:10.536
Got it.

24:10.623 --> 24:12.233
<i>RYKER : Chris, </i>
I gotta call you back.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.241
The envelopes
that were used,

24:20.328 --> 24:22.025
they were a pre-stamped
version that were

24:22.112 --> 24:24.027
only sold in post offices.

24:24.114 --> 24:26.900
Correct.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.989
I'm sorry, I'm not following
your logic right now.

24:29.076 --> 24:31.121
What if
there were microscopic
printing irregularities

24:31.208 --> 24:33.341
on the envelopes?

24:33.428 --> 24:35.561
And what if we could
match them to the machines
that made them,

24:35.648 --> 24:37.911
and then track the
shipment logs to follow

24:37.998 --> 24:40.174
where the batches
of envelopes with

24:40.261 --> 24:43.046
those specific
printing imperfections,
and where they were sent?

24:43.133 --> 24:46.397
Okay. We could pinpoint
the place of sale.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.138
We could look through
all the security footage.

24:48.225 --> 24:49.879
And then track
credit card purchases.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.315
Leading us to
the terrorist operative

24:51.402 --> 24:53.448
who bought them.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.319
Or the
highly-educated straight
white Christian male

24:55.406 --> 24:57.278
over 30 acting alone.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.551
Okay, I'll load
these up on the truck.

25:09.638 --> 25:12.815
And then we'll go
ahead and start decon.

25:16.602 --> 25:20.562
The problem is,
she doesn't have any proof.

25:20.649 --> 25:24.610
We just got her word
that Ivins defaced her
property or took the notebook.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.307
It could have been anybody.

25:26.394 --> 25:27.830
She seemed
pretty credible to me.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.876
Well,
maybe he stuck on her.

25:29.963 --> 25:31.442
Maybe she led him on.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.835
Maybe he was slow in
getting the message,

25:32.922 --> 25:36.317
doesn't make him a killer.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.101
What should
I do with the report?

25:38.188 --> 25:39.668
It really seems like
there's something there.

25:39.755 --> 25:40.800
Mark
the lead as covered.

25:40.887 --> 25:43.454
Just file it.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.587
Dearest Mara,

25:45.674 --> 25:49.678
I hope you enjoyed my poem
about the two Bruces.

25:49.765 --> 25:51.854
I have spoken to my therapist,

25:51.941 --> 25:54.465
who posits my current
sensitivities may be

25:54.553 --> 25:56.598
related to my medications.

25:56.685 --> 26:00.733
I have never been able to
really confide in other people.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.474
That's why you and
Jody mean so much to me.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.393
Congratulations
on your soccer game.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.745
Come to USAMRIID for
a visit and bring your
anthrax strains with you.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.311
Your devoted friend...

26:14.398 --> 26:16.009
Saddam.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.793
It's come to my attention
that you and Mara have
been emailing each other

27:44.880 --> 27:46.665
about me behind my back.

27:49.537 --> 27:52.845
And I think it's
just plain mean.

27:52.932 --> 27:55.021
- Bruce.
- It's hard to understand,

27:55.108 --> 28:00.200
because I've never
spoken about her or

28:00.287 --> 28:04.683
you other than
in glowing terms.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.697
Thanks for
meeting us, Inspector.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.700
Dust and
debris collects on
the printing plates,

28:21.787 --> 28:23.527
ink grows ever so
slightly fainter toward

28:23.614 --> 28:25.834
the end of a print run.

28:25.921 --> 28:28.881
Is it possible
to use any microscopic
flaws in the envelopes to

28:28.968 --> 28:31.710
track them back to
the place of purchase?

28:31.797 --> 28:33.450
I suppose.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.757
Blue Eagle envelopes
are sold in packs of 500.

28:35.844 --> 28:40.675
Oh, you can eliminate
any envelopes printed
before March 1st, 2001.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.938
- Why is that?
- Postage?

28:43.025 --> 28:44.766
Price
jumped by one cent.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.333
Okay.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.074
Any other
way to narrow it down?

28:48.161 --> 28:49.553
The attack
envelopes used our new ink,

28:49.640 --> 28:51.251
it's a brighter blue
in the eagle wing,

28:51.338 --> 28:54.167
a more vibrant gray
in the denomination number.

28:54.254 --> 28:56.952
That reduces the
number of envelopes in
the runnings to roughly,

28:57.039 --> 28:59.781
I'd say,

28:59.868 --> 29:02.175
31 million?

29:05.874 --> 29:07.354
To the naked eye,

29:07.441 --> 29:09.138
all pre-stamped
envelopes look the same.

29:09.225 --> 29:13.273
But if you look at the
printing imperfections here,

29:13.360 --> 29:18.060
and here, and here,

29:18.147 --> 29:19.975
these ink discrepancies,

29:20.062 --> 29:22.543
they're all from an actual
envelope we have in evidence.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.980
We recalled
the envelopes from the post
offices that sold them,

29:25.067 --> 29:26.460
but we ran into a roadblock.

29:26.547 --> 29:28.070
Several had already sold out.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.811
Then what
good does that do us?

29:29.898 --> 29:31.682
If we replicate
the missing print runs,

29:31.770 --> 29:35.730
the printer still has the
same plate, stock, even ink.

29:35.817 --> 29:38.602
The same irregularity
should appear in a pattern,

29:38.689 --> 29:40.866
and we can narrow down which
envelopes we're looking for,

29:40.953 --> 29:43.303
which post offices
they were shipped to.

29:43.390 --> 29:46.306
Basically,
bring us right to where
the killer bought them.

29:46.393 --> 29:49.918
I got approval
for more Amerithrax teams
to come onboard and

29:50.005 --> 29:51.659
you're honestly asking for

29:51.746 --> 29:54.227
a quarter-million
to print some damn envelopes?

29:54.314 --> 29:55.750
The White House
did say whatever we need

29:55.837 --> 29:57.056
to catch this guy.

29:57.143 --> 29:58.579
"Guy?"

29:58.666 --> 30:01.016
Toretti got her
claws in you now?

30:01.103 --> 30:03.802
Sir, we just
learned earlier today that
the only labs outside the US

30:03.889 --> 30:07.109
with Ames are in
the UK and Canada.

30:07.196 --> 30:09.546
Now, we vetted every
single person in those labs,

30:09.633 --> 30:11.026
whoever sent these letters got

30:11.113 --> 30:13.376
their anthrax
from an American lab.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.065
What's it called in
football, when the quarterback

38:49.152 --> 38:51.633
throws a long forward
pass in desperation?

38:51.720 --> 38:53.635
That's
not what this is.

38:53.722 --> 38:54.767
If this
isn't a Hail Mary,

38:54.854 --> 38:56.246
what would you call it?

38:56.334 --> 38:57.204
It's a
controlled experiment.

38:57.291 --> 38:58.248
Oh, okay.

39:00.555 --> 39:03.776
You thought I was
crazy for seeing a code
in the attack letters?

39:03.863 --> 39:05.430
Just admit it.

39:05.517 --> 39:06.953
You're out on a limb.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.694
I'm impressed.

39:11.087 --> 39:12.959
You don't
give up, do you?

39:13.046 --> 39:16.571
There is no place for
you in the Bureau if you do.

39:16.658 --> 39:18.399
I would wager every last penny

39:18.486 --> 39:21.707
I have based on those
very tense jaw muscles,

39:21.794 --> 39:24.840
this is a first
for you, summa cum laude.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.625
I bet your credit
score is way over 800.

39:26.712 --> 39:29.062
Okay, fine.

39:29.149 --> 39:31.325
It shouldn't be any secret
that when you're the only kid

39:31.412 --> 39:32.848
in school who
doesn't fit the pattern,

39:32.935 --> 39:35.242
especially back
in the 70s, and now,

39:35.329 --> 39:39.942
you're the only guy
in your department who
breaks the mold, yeah,

39:40.029 --> 39:41.640
you spend a lot
of useless energy

39:41.727 --> 39:45.078
being the poster child
for following the rules.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.865
But I'm guessing
you're familiar with that.

39:49.952 --> 39:53.260
Working on holidays,
turning in every report early

39:53.347 --> 39:56.394
while the title-jumper
at the next desk golfs
with the boss on Fridays?

39:56.481 --> 40:00.223
Yeah, maybe I do.

40:00.310 --> 40:03.923
This is the
first time I've actually
put my job on the line,

40:04.010 --> 40:07.535
and I've never wanted anything
more than to catch these guys.

40:12.671 --> 40:16.152
They said it's
gonna take all night, so.

40:17.676 --> 40:19.547
I'm gonna
hang here for a while.

40:19.634 --> 40:21.680
Yeah, suit yourself.

40:21.767 --> 40:22.942
Um...

40:24.639 --> 40:26.598
For what it's worth,

40:26.685 --> 40:30.602
you are doing the
right thing here.

40:30.689 --> 40:32.734
That only matters
if we find something.

41:15.690 --> 41:17.692
Pass it
to me, let's go.

41:48.114 --> 41:49.507
Oops.

41:53.075 --> 41:55.469
Pass it, pass it.

42:12.007 --> 42:14.053
Get them, Mara!

42:18.405 --> 42:20.581
Woo!

42:23.192 --> 42:25.934
Go, Mara, get them!

42:26.021 --> 42:29.329
Get them, Mara! Woo!

42:29.416 --> 42:30.765
Get in there, Mara.

42:30.852 --> 42:32.158
You got it.

42:32.245 --> 42:34.856
Get the ball, go, Mara!

42:34.943 --> 42:35.944
Yeah, you got it.

42:36.031 --> 42:37.903
That's you, Mara, woo!

42:37.990 --> 42:39.121
Hey, it's me, oh.

42:39.208 --> 42:40.993
Hey, she's wide open.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.081
Wow.

42:44.170 --> 42:46.346
Sorry. You okay?

42:54.310 --> 42:55.311
Back it up,
give her room.

42:55.398 --> 42:56.443
Back it up, guys.

42:56.530 --> 42:57.879
Give her space.

43:43.490 --> 43:46.058
They found an exact
match with the printing.

43:48.364 --> 43:50.149
This is the post
office that sold the envelope?

43:50.236 --> 43:51.585
Yeah.

43:51.672 --> 43:53.152
You did it.

43:53.239 --> 43:54.849
So, Jersey
is 200 miles away,

43:54.936 --> 43:57.112
that's seven hours
by car round trip.

43:58.505 --> 44:00.202
Okay.

44:00.289 --> 44:02.161
It's far enough to
avoid immediate suspicion,

44:02.248 --> 44:03.162
but it's an easy drive.

44:03.249 --> 44:04.816
Mm-hmm.

44:04.903 --> 44:06.034
We'll check the toll booths
for any cameras,

44:06.121 --> 44:07.993
but our guy is pretty smart.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.864
Avoiding the tollways would add
about an hour to his trip.

44:09.951 --> 44:11.779
Mm-hmm.

44:11.866 --> 44:15.609
If he leaves before midnight,
he's back home by morning.

44:15.696 --> 44:18.786
Oh, boy, it's just
middle of nowhere Maryland.

44:18.873 --> 44:20.396
This is an entirely
new area to canvass.

44:20.483 --> 44:22.355
Maybe not.

44:22.442 --> 44:23.878
I got something to show you.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.326
Take a look at that building.

44:37.413 --> 44:38.763
What is that?

44:38.850 --> 44:40.721
That's USAMRIID.

44:40.808 --> 44:43.724
One of the 16 labs in the
US that has the Ames strain.

44:43.811 --> 44:45.030
So, if our guy
bought the envelopes here,

44:45.117 --> 44:46.466
that means...

44:46.553 --> 44:48.163
That the
anthrax came from

44:48.250 --> 44:49.948
the most respected
Biodefense lab in the country.

44:54.256 --> 44:57.216
Someone in that
building is our killer.

45:01.394 --> 45:04.136
.
