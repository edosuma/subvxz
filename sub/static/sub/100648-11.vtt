00:04.091 --> 00:06.397
- Previously
on "Good Girls"...

00:06.441 --> 00:08.269
- We suck up to the gang leader
who we stole from

00:08.312 --> 00:10.662
and convince him
to pay us a living wage.

00:10.706 --> 00:14.362
- Which we then use
to pay someone else

00:14.405 --> 00:16.190
to blow his brains out.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.931
- I am here to see
a Mr. James Fitzpatrick.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.107
- He left something for you.

00:20.150 --> 00:23.327
- 11,000 in incidentals?

00:23.371 --> 00:24.894
- How much cut
have you got now?

00:24.937 --> 00:26.069
- I don't know.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.592
- Where's it all going,
Elizabeth?

00:27.636 --> 00:28.941
- I can't tell you.

00:28.985 --> 00:31.031
- Then I can't cut you in
anymore.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.120
- I quit my job today.
- Why?

00:33.163 --> 00:34.991
- I kissed my boss.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.037
- Hot tubs.
It's not regulated.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.473
Any idiot can sell them.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.997
- Welcome to Boland Bubbles.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.651
- This is the crime jar.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.261
Do something good
with the money.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.523
- I figured out
who we should help.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.090
I got their daughter's kidney.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.049
- How about a car?

00:49.092 --> 00:50.180
- Pardon?

00:50.224 --> 00:52.226
- I had him recall
the nail polish.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.576
Nail salon robbed.
Guess what they took?

01:09.156 --> 01:10.722
- ♪ Get smart

01:10.766 --> 01:12.420

02:16.179 --> 02:19.095
- Then you came
to the right person.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.444
- Let's hope so.

02:20.488 --> 02:21.706
- ♪ Ooh, mother

- Whoa.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.591
- What do you think?

02:36.634 --> 02:38.680
- Bold.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.551
- Go Red or Go Home.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.118
- Yeah, baby.
Go red!

02:43.641 --> 02:46.557
- That's just the name
of the polish.

02:46.601 --> 02:47.819
- Oh.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.258
And go easy on the high-fives
till you're dry.

02:51.301 --> 02:52.389
- Okay.
Oh, hey, oh.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.477
Can I get some change?

02:53.521 --> 02:56.088
- Oh, yeah.
- Thanks.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.090
Geez, you gotta check tens now?

02:58.134 --> 03:00.397
- You never know
what's out there.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.312
- I wouldn't even know
what to look for.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.140
- Oh, there's little tricks.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.316
Obvious stuff.
Security strip, the ink.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.405
But here's the real giveaway.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.015
You see right below Hammy
there?

03:10.059 --> 03:12.627
- Mm-hmm.
- Tiny microprint.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.194
- Wow, you really know
your stuff.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.500
- Ah.

03:16.544 --> 03:19.764
You'll smudge.

03:19.808 --> 03:22.419
- I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

03:33.865 --> 03:37.869
- So what can I do
for you guys?

03:39.088 --> 03:41.786
- Well, I guess you could say
we're in the market.

03:45.312 --> 03:48.053
- You came back
for a hot tub?

03:48.097 --> 03:50.404
- We want all of 'em.

03:51.883 --> 03:54.799
Excuse me?

03:54.843 --> 03:58.412
- We would like to buy
your place, Gayle.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.372
-  Yo, Pimp.
- Hey.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.374
- How's the delivery biz
treating you?

04:04.418 --> 04:06.637
- Really sucks, Eric.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.248
- Word.

04:12.469 --> 04:14.079
- I'm not following.

04:14.123 --> 04:15.298
- So we took monthly sales

04:15.342 --> 04:17.387
plus the equity left
in the franchise,

04:17.431 --> 04:19.389
we netted out
the S, G, and A costs,

04:19.433 --> 04:22.653
and projected a 5%
cash flow growth.

04:22.697 --> 04:25.961
- And according to the National
Pool and Spa Association,

04:26.004 --> 04:28.964
he's being very generous.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.096
- That's how we got the number.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.665
It's pretty fair.

04:34.709 --> 04:38.234
- Why would I be looking
to sell?

04:38.278 --> 04:41.759
- Because my husband's
looking to buy.

04:41.803 --> 04:45.285
- Maybe he should look
somewhere else.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.983
- Why's that?

04:48.026 --> 04:49.289
You didn't.

04:54.598 --> 04:57.688
Two ways we can handle this.

04:57.732 --> 05:00.735
One: you bow out discreetly

05:00.778 --> 05:02.824
and spend a little time
with your family.

05:07.568 --> 05:10.745
- What's the other?

05:10.788 --> 05:13.008
- Pretty much exactly the same,

05:13.051 --> 05:15.358
only we would be less discreet

05:15.402 --> 05:16.925
and your family
would just hate you

05:16.968 --> 05:18.840
for the rest of your life.

05:27.849 --> 05:32.332
- On page three, you'll see
we let you keep the awards.

05:34.290 --> 05:37.075
- If I sold,

05:37.119 --> 05:39.817
it would be for way more
than what you're offering.

05:43.125 --> 05:45.519
- Try us.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.354
- Where are we gonna get
that kind of money?

05:54.397 --> 05:56.399
- I don't know.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.531
- Like, a loan or--

05:57.574 --> 05:59.184
- I don't know.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.490
I'll find it.
- No.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.668
- Why?

06:04.712 --> 06:07.062
- If we're doing this,
it has to be legit.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.372
Okay.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.591
- For real?

06:14.635 --> 06:16.637
- I believe in you.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.378
- How is that a win-win?

06:18.421 --> 06:20.815
- He gets to feel like a man,

06:20.858 --> 06:23.644
and we have a new way
to wash our cut.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.602
- Have you guys seen my phone?

06:25.646 --> 06:27.387
- Okay, but in what universe

06:27.430 --> 06:28.953
are they gonna give
a business loan

06:28.997 --> 06:30.259
to a Postmates driver?

06:30.302 --> 06:33.044
- Whose last business
was raided by the FBI?

06:33.088 --> 06:35.873
- Do you even have
a credit card right now?

06:35.917 --> 06:39.050
- I have lots of them.
And they're all maxed out.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.705
- How is it just gone?

06:41.749 --> 06:45.535
- Look, he's gotta believe
this thing is his, okay?

06:45.579 --> 06:48.451
- Again, so he can
"feel like a man."

06:48.495 --> 06:52.499
- But eventually, he'll have
to come to me for the money.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.023
- Which we don't have.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.546
- Few more runs.

06:56.590 --> 06:59.201
- Then we'll all be taking
steamy Bolands.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.552
- I swear I had it
this morning.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.337
- Well, did you check
your purse?

07:05.381 --> 07:06.643
- Obviously.

07:06.687 --> 07:09.385
- Car?
- I looked.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.952
- Because your case
is the same color as your seat.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.432
- Not in the car.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.956
- Find My Phone?

07:16.523 --> 07:18.176
- Don't get mad at us.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.135
- Yeah.
We have our phones.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.008
- Oh, my God.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.141
- Oh!

07:26.184 --> 07:28.099
Your pocket.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.624
- My pocket.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.061
You think I didn't check
my pocket?

07:41.330 --> 07:42.853
- Where have you been?

07:42.897 --> 07:43.898
- You likey?

07:43.941 --> 07:44.942
- We're done.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.466
- Too slutty?
Not slutty enough?

07:46.509 --> 07:48.163
- He's pulling the plug.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.425
- Why?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.992
- 'Cause we don't have
anything.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.647
- How about the third best
Pad Thai Detroit has to offer?

07:53.690 --> 07:56.780
- That's not enough.

07:56.824 --> 07:59.479
I'm just so much hotter here.

07:59.522 --> 08:02.003
A D.C. six
is like a Detroit nine.

08:02.046 --> 08:05.310
- How about this?

08:05.354 --> 08:07.661
- Is that hers?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.708
Cute kids.

08:11.752 --> 08:14.537
- They're okay.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.191
- I'll unpack.

08:42.696 --> 08:45.002
- So how's your system going?

08:47.483 --> 08:50.355
It's...good.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.096
It's fine.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.185
- Just fine?

08:54.229 --> 08:56.361
- It's great.

08:56.405 --> 09:00.104
We're almost up and running.

09:00.148 --> 09:03.455
- So how's it work?

09:03.499 --> 09:05.632
- What do you mean?

09:05.675 --> 09:09.026
- Walk me through it.

09:09.070 --> 09:11.376
- Hot tubs
are sorta like mattresses.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.508
- That right?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.162
- Brands aren't
apples to apples

09:14.205 --> 09:15.990
so there's no way of knowing
what the real price is.

09:16.033 --> 09:19.384
My books can say anything.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.691
- Free delivery?

09:21.735 --> 09:24.346
- Whatever the customer wants.

09:24.389 --> 09:27.567
- Got my tub the same day.

09:27.610 --> 09:30.004
- It's all profit.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.179
You have my cut?

09:33.703 --> 09:36.488
- Yeah, about that...

09:36.532 --> 09:37.881
I'm thinking
it'd be better business

09:37.925 --> 09:40.623
if you just wash everything
on your end.

09:40.667 --> 09:41.798
And like you said,

09:41.842 --> 09:44.366
car wash thing's bad news,
right?

09:44.409 --> 09:46.063
- Yeah, IRS is all over that.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.022
- And we don't wanna fight
with Uncle Sam, right?

09:48.065 --> 09:49.414
- That guy'll mess you up good.

09:54.942 --> 09:57.292
- But my system is just for me.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.946
- Oh, no.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.556
No.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.993
We're consolidating.

10:06.954 --> 10:09.434
- So you want me to print
and wash.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.436
- Mm.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.003
There's a business term
for that.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.570
What is it?
- Synergy.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.658
- Synergy!

10:15.702 --> 10:17.529
Synergy.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.619
That's right.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.146
So same time, yeah?

10:27.191 --> 10:29.672
- For what?

10:29.716 --> 10:31.152
- My cut.

10:44.339 --> 10:47.081
- Please tell me
you've seen my phone.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.996
- Nope.

10:50.301 --> 10:53.130
Been looking all day.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.654
- Well, maybe
it's with all the money

10:54.697 --> 10:56.830
that used to be in here.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.013
Oh, you think
'cause you stashed it

11:06.056 --> 11:07.797
in a Chico's bag
at the bottom of the bin,

11:07.841 --> 11:09.669
I wouldn't see it?

11:16.545 --> 11:18.155
- They needed a car.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.681
- You know what I did
to fill this thing?

11:21.724 --> 11:23.770
- She put me on the spot, Stan.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.902
- All the shady hustles.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.733
- Our child
wouldn't even be here.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.387
- I left my soul in that jar.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.999
- Okay.

11:36.043 --> 11:39.133
It's my money too.
- Our money.

11:39.176 --> 11:40.917
- It went to the right people.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.136
- That's not the point.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.746
- Okay.
What if you had said no?

11:43.790 --> 11:45.661
- That's the point.
- What?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.228
- You didn't give me
the chance.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.844
- You didn't see her face.

11:54.888 --> 11:58.282
- You know what?

11:58.326 --> 11:59.719
You deal with the kids
in the morning.

11:59.762 --> 12:00.763
- What do you want from me?

12:00.807 --> 12:02.025
- I got a late shift.
- Stan.

12:02.069 --> 12:05.115
- I want you to be the woman
that I married.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.292
- I don't even know
what that means.

12:10.773 --> 12:13.733
- You're paying me back.

12:13.776 --> 12:16.170
- Are you serious?

12:16.213 --> 12:18.346
- Yeah.

12:18.389 --> 12:21.088
- Or what, Stan?
- There is no "or what."

12:22.872 --> 12:25.179
- Excuse me?

12:28.835 --> 12:30.184
- Do it.

12:41.543 --> 12:42.674
- "Synergy"?

12:42.718 --> 12:44.633
- What does that even mean?

12:44.676 --> 12:47.157
- It means
it was never our system.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.985
- Flipping his game.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.291
Flipping it again and again.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.293
- We've been building it
for him.

12:52.336 --> 12:55.470
- I mean, it sounds more like
vertical integration.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.649
Just if you wanted
to be technical.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.433
- Why would you tell him
it's operational?

13:02.477 --> 13:04.479
- I said almost.

13:04.522 --> 13:05.959
And we needed the cut.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.743
- That we didn't get anyway.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.571
- Sorry, is something burning?

13:09.614 --> 13:12.748
- Danny!
I said out in the driveway!

13:14.010 --> 13:15.359
It's his science project.

13:15.403 --> 13:18.232
- Where is the hit man
when you need him?

13:18.275 --> 13:20.495
- Oh, lemme tell you.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.850
Rasta Pasta
at the Rainforest Café,

13:27.894 --> 13:29.896
oat milk lattes
at Great Lakes--

13:29.939 --> 13:31.985
- He went bananas
at Home Depot.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.337
- At least he put us
back on the schedule.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.468
- When?

13:37.512 --> 13:38.774
- Well, I don't know

13:38.818 --> 13:41.168
because his appointment girl
won't call me back.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.823
- How many people is he booked
to kill in a week?

13:43.866 --> 13:45.781
- Okay, you know what?
Let's just not freak out.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.479
'Cause all we have to do is--

13:48.523 --> 13:50.090
if we take the--we can--

13:54.224 --> 13:55.747
What do we do?

13:55.791 --> 13:57.837
- We're gonna go old-school.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.535
We're gonna wash it
little by little

14:00.578 --> 14:02.537
till we can afford
to buy the place.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.367
- Can't do that.

14:06.410 --> 14:09.500
- Why?

14:09.544 --> 14:10.806
- I need it sooner.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.894
- Well, it's not like
that bitch

14:11.938 --> 14:14.244
has any other offers coming in.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.767
- It's for my marriage.

14:29.825 --> 14:32.219
- I've got a bigger balance
on my Starbucks card.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.221
- What's in her email?

14:34.264 --> 14:36.049
- Nothing.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.920
Only took me 22 hours

14:37.964 --> 14:40.401
and a case of Red Bull
to break in.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.838
- Texts?

14:42.882 --> 14:46.624
Husband, playdates,
carpool, church.

14:46.668 --> 14:50.759
Emojis.
So many prayer hands.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.804
- Those are actually two people
high-fiving.

14:56.286 --> 14:58.985
- So when my friend Melissa
was at the vet

14:59.028 --> 15:00.987
with her cat
who was hit by a car,

15:01.030 --> 15:01.944
I high-fived her?

15:01.988 --> 15:04.425
Like, "Yay, they got him good"?

15:04.468 --> 15:06.427
- Unless she thought
they were prayer hands.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.907
- How do I know?

15:07.950 --> 15:10.561
- Well, what happened
to the cat?

15:10.605 --> 15:13.086
- She never responded.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.871
- You high-fived its death.

15:20.528 --> 15:23.487
I mean, who hangs out
with friends this much?

15:23.531 --> 15:25.359
- Where'd you eat lunch
in high school?

15:25.402 --> 15:26.969
- In the bleachers.
Why?

15:27.013 --> 15:29.145
- Say no more.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.321
You know none of this
is admissible.

15:31.365 --> 15:33.933
- Don't need it for court.

15:43.855 --> 15:47.163
- Something wrong
with the potato salad?

15:47.207 --> 15:49.252
- Nope.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.692
- 'Cause it's
your mother's recipe.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.045
- Already ate.

16:01.873 --> 16:04.746
- You could've saved me
the trip.

16:04.789 --> 16:07.096
- You could've asked me first.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.793
Oh, right.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.317
That's not your thing.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.064
- Hey, Ruthie!

16:18.107 --> 16:21.676
- Hey.

16:21.719 --> 16:24.505
- Ooh, is that Cherisse's
potato salad?

16:24.548 --> 16:26.507
- Have mine.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.204
- Oh, yum.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.340
- I have that same cream.

16:33.383 --> 16:36.169
- It's yours.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.866
- It's so dope

16:37.909 --> 16:39.781
'cause when you have to pick up
all the money from the stage,

16:39.824 --> 16:41.957
your hands get so dry.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.219
Thank you.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.613
- My pleasure.

16:45.656 --> 16:48.094
- Super silky.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.791
- Oh, I know it is.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.314
- You know, it feels expensive.

16:51.358 --> 16:54.448
- Very.

16:54.491 --> 16:57.364
- Hey, would you tell Neal
I'll be out there in a second?

16:57.407 --> 16:59.279
- You bet, Stanimal.

17:01.411 --> 17:02.630
Bye.

17:07.939 --> 17:11.160
- I know you're dying for me
to say "could've asked."

17:12.901 --> 17:14.816
- What if you had said no?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.646
- Perfect.

17:42.191 --> 17:44.280
I know how we're gonna wash
that money.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.806
- We do the traditional square,

17:48.850 --> 17:52.245
but the pillow party box
is also very popular

17:52.288 --> 17:55.161
I will be right over here
if you have any questions.

17:58.599 --> 17:59.861
- We're robbing Stan.

18:05.475 --> 18:09.000
- Literally anything else
would be better.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.263
- Okay.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.613
Quick brainstorm sesh?

18:12.656 --> 18:13.701
- Okay.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.703
- Okay.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.052
- What do you got?

18:22.362 --> 18:24.494
- ATM spree.
- Yes.

18:24.538 --> 18:27.802
We hook a chain up
to the back of a car...

18:31.110 --> 18:32.981
- Then what?

18:39.248 --> 18:40.641
- Okay.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.338
What about something like the--

18:42.382 --> 18:44.993
the pizza guy
with the bomb vest?

18:45.036 --> 18:46.647
- Oh, yeah.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.736
But that guy robbed a bank.
- Yeah.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.172
Yeah, but, you know,

18:50.216 --> 18:52.087
I saw a whole Netflix
documentary about it.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.219
He was in on it

18:53.262 --> 18:55.656
and he walked out
with a huge bag of cash.

18:55.699 --> 18:58.398
- And then he got his head
blown off.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.402
- Oh, I didn't know that part.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.143
- Must've fallen asleep
by that point.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.101
- Ugh.
I'm so mad at Stan.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.624
This makes the most sense.

19:07.668 --> 19:11.411
- What makes the most sense
is couples therapy.

19:11.454 --> 19:12.716
Not grand larceny.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.544
- You didn't see
the way he talked to me.

19:14.588 --> 19:17.852
- Look, Stanimal aside,

19:17.895 --> 19:20.376
I mean, that place
is pretty much a trash heap.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.291
- The whole hellhole
should be burned to the ground.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.380
- At this point,
I don't even know who we owe.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.643
Is it a hit man, homeboy,
hot tub?

19:26.687 --> 19:28.993
So whatever.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.386
I'm down.

19:30.430 --> 19:33.346
- I just don't get it.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.217
- What's not to get?

19:35.261 --> 19:36.479
It's an armored truck.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.133
- Swap fake for real.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.004
- But the fake cash

19:40.048 --> 19:42.572
goes straight to the bank

19:42.616 --> 19:44.444
and we go straight to jail.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.405
- So there's a few kinks
to work out.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.326
- How's the Sisterhood
of the Traveling Pants?

21:24.370 --> 21:26.807
- Always together.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.199
- DL Dave's gonna want more

21:28.243 --> 21:30.811
than their favorite tabes
at Cheesecake Factory.

21:30.854 --> 21:32.943
- Here's what I know
about girls who are this tight.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.380
- Literally nothing.

21:34.423 --> 21:37.208
- But they know everything
about each other.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.645
She's not in this alone.

21:38.688 --> 21:40.037
- Get your own.

21:40.081 --> 21:41.561
- What?

21:43.824 --> 21:46.348
- Beth.

21:46.392 --> 21:49.525
- Yeah?

21:49.569 --> 21:51.614
- High risk.
- Uh, hello.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.399
- That's what I heard all day.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.530
- From who?

21:54.574 --> 21:57.359
- Banks, credit unions,

21:57.403 --> 21:58.882
those payday places,

21:58.926 --> 22:02.408
even that D-bag
all over the bus stops.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.498
You know how it says
"instant approval"

22:05.541 --> 22:06.890
or "no credit score too low"?

22:06.934 --> 22:09.763
Guess what.
They never met Dean Boland.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.199
- So what are you gonna do?

22:13.593 --> 22:15.725
I don't know.

22:19.773 --> 22:21.383
My mom's gonna give us
her ottoman.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.819
- We don't have a couch

22:22.863 --> 22:25.605
- I told her that.
- Good.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.389
- The ottoman will be here
tomorrow.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.523
- I know.
I'm sorry.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.051
I just don't want him
involved again.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.448
- Okay.

22:42.491 --> 22:45.189
- Okay.

22:45.233 --> 22:47.888
- Now could you...

22:47.931 --> 22:49.585
- Sorry.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.638
- What are you doing here?

22:58.681 --> 23:01.118
- You still gotta eat.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.120
- I'm fine.

23:03.164 --> 23:04.992
- Cheetos aren't lunch.

23:10.824 --> 23:13.304
I'm gonna pay you back.

23:13.348 --> 23:16.307
Every cent.

23:24.751 --> 23:28.624
- Is that pot roast?

23:28.668 --> 23:31.148
- Ten hours in the slow cooker.

23:44.945 --> 23:47.208
- 'Scuse me, sir?
Sir?

23:47.251 --> 23:48.209
Have you seen that man?

23:48.252 --> 23:49.776
Did you see the man
go in there?

23:49.819 --> 23:51.473
- I didn't see anyone.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.825
- Said he's here
for the Caesar salad.

23:55.869 --> 23:58.959
Like that's why a man
spends all night in there.

23:59.002 --> 24:02.005
For the tableside Caesar salad!

24:02.049 --> 24:04.225
- I used this merlot marinade.
- Mm-hmm.

24:04.268 --> 24:06.880
- It's literally going to melt
in your mouth.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.142
- Oh.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.100
Be right back.
- No, one bite, one bite.

24:10.144 --> 24:11.667
- Do they even have
a Caesar salad?

24:11.711 --> 24:14.496
I mean, do they have

24:14.540 --> 24:16.542
a Caesar salad?

24:16.585 --> 24:18.108
- Maybe?
- Yeah.

24:18.152 --> 24:19.545
Maybe.

24:19.588 --> 24:22.722

they do on his face, huh?

with dolphins on 'em.

26:55.918 --> 26:59.052
- The kids love 'em.

26:59.095 --> 27:00.880
- Whatever works.

27:00.923 --> 27:03.230
- So do we have a deal?

27:03.273 --> 27:05.406
That's up to you.

27:05.449 --> 27:06.712
- What do you need,
a week or two?

27:06.755 --> 27:08.452
I mean, ideally,
we would like to transition

27:08.496 --> 27:09.932
as soon as possible.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.412
- Can I ask you something?

27:11.455 --> 27:13.632
- And we'll need a release
from the franchise agreement.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.679
- Why would you do this
for him?

27:19.463 --> 27:21.552
- Because he is my husband.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.339
- That's enough?

27:27.733 --> 27:28.908
- No.

27:28.951 --> 27:32.912
I need you to initial here,
here, and here.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.043
- I'm sorry.

27:34.087 --> 27:35.610
You just take
"standing by your man"

27:35.654 --> 27:37.656
to a whole new level.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.833
- Well, you don't know him.

27:43.444 --> 27:44.445
- I know if he told you

27:44.488 --> 27:46.534
what really happened
between us,

27:46.577 --> 27:48.884
you wouldn't waste
a cute dolphin check on him.

27:53.846 --> 27:57.719
Oh, honey.

27:57.763 --> 28:00.287
- What?

28:00.330 --> 28:02.550
- I'm not the first, am I?

28:09.209 --> 28:12.168
- We can finish this up later.

28:12.212 --> 28:15.128
- Should I hold on to this?

28:15.171 --> 28:18.131
- I'll take that.

28:18.174 --> 28:19.915
- I think that's smart.

28:26.574 --> 28:28.837
- Got a new phone.

28:42.372 --> 28:43.896
- What'd you do
with the rest of it?

28:57.561 --> 29:00.434
So what?
We just good now?

29:03.263 --> 29:05.178
- You told me to pay you back.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.875
I did it.

29:06.919 --> 29:09.791
- So you steal from me
to pay back what you stole?

29:09.835 --> 29:12.359
- It wasn't really from you.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.753
- Yeah, it's from where I work.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.232
- It's not a church, Stanley.

29:16.276 --> 29:17.799
That place runs on sin.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.540
- It's still my ass
on the line.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.498
- It never made it to the bank.

29:21.542 --> 29:22.978
- Oh, great.

29:23.022 --> 29:25.764
- So you can say however much
you want was in those bags.

29:25.807 --> 29:28.375
- Thanks for having my back.

29:28.418 --> 29:30.769
- I'm just making my man happy.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.205
You know, following orders.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.293
- Come on.

29:33.336 --> 29:34.903
- 'Cause you're the boss now,
right?

29:34.947 --> 29:36.644
You run the house.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.385
- I don't want that.
- That's what I heard.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.952
- I want old you.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.041
Okay?
The way you used to be before.

29:42.084 --> 29:43.738
The whole point
of this stupid thing

29:43.782 --> 29:45.087
was to make us better people,
babe,

29:45.131 --> 29:46.872
and you stole from it.

29:46.915 --> 29:50.266
- To pay for a car
for someone that needed it!

29:50.310 --> 29:53.269
Which makes me a better person!

29:53.313 --> 29:55.619
- It's ruining us.

30:08.589 --> 30:10.721
- So what do you want?

30:10.765 --> 30:12.114
You wanna go back?
- I don't know.

30:12.158 --> 30:13.550
I don't know.

30:13.594 --> 30:15.161
- You wanna go back
to the mall?

30:15.204 --> 30:16.510
I go back to slinging donuts?

30:16.553 --> 30:18.817
- I don't know.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.514
- 'Cause I gotta tell you,

30:20.557 --> 30:21.863
there's not enough donuts
in the world

30:21.907 --> 30:23.952
that's gonna cover
our baby's meds.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.878
But hey...

30:36.922 --> 30:39.446
maybe Paul Blart
can save the day.

31:06.690 --> 31:08.170
- Oh, hey.

31:08.214 --> 31:10.564
The kids' smoke detector
hasn't had a battery

31:10.607 --> 31:12.566
in God knows how long.

31:14.698 --> 31:17.571
- Well, there's really nothing
left to lose.

31:17.614 --> 31:20.704
- Right.
Only our whole family.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.621
- Can I ask you something?

31:24.665 --> 31:28.756
- Sure there was a spare 9-volt
in here somewhere.

31:28.799 --> 31:31.715
- Would you have ever
slept with her?

31:34.196 --> 31:37.069
- What?

31:37.112 --> 31:38.635
- Like, before.

31:38.679 --> 31:41.160
When we were really not
doing well.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.947
- Um...

31:49.342 --> 31:51.779
Found it.

31:51.822 --> 31:55.348
- I mean, she's not...

31:55.391 --> 31:57.132
not-pretty.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.050
- Okay, you look amazing.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.967
- That's not what I asked.

32:11.016 --> 32:13.627
Would you have ever
slept with her?

32:21.417 --> 32:23.332
- Uh...

32:25.595 --> 32:28.337
She wears this...

32:28.381 --> 32:30.600
perfume.

32:32.298 --> 32:35.562
- Sexy.

32:35.605 --> 32:38.434
- And she's got...

32:38.478 --> 32:40.610
a really nice ass.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.832
And...

32:44.875 --> 32:48.401
perfectly sized...

32:48.444 --> 32:51.186
boobs.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.145
And she's kinda crazy,

32:53.188 --> 32:56.365
which could go either way
in the sack, and--

32:56.409 --> 32:59.020
and overall,

32:59.064 --> 33:02.067
it seems...

33:02.110 --> 33:03.416
you know, worth the gamble.

33:03.459 --> 33:05.635
- So you would've.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.687
- Probably.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.786
- Thanks for being honest.

34:04.694 --> 34:06.783
Where's the chief?

34:06.827 --> 34:09.308
- Art class.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.266
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:11.310 --> 34:14.617
You know, pencils and chalk
and whatnot.

34:14.661 --> 34:17.664
And then he's going
to aerobics.

34:17.707 --> 34:20.841
Is that good enough for you?

34:20.884 --> 34:22.321
Where the hell's his cut?

34:29.676 --> 34:32.853
- It was my son's diaper bag.
Just bring it back next time.

34:34.246 --> 34:37.510
Hey.

34:37.553 --> 34:39.425
I need another favor.

34:39.468 --> 34:41.992
You serious?

34:42.036 --> 34:45.126
- I'm obviously good for it.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.562
- I'll have to add it
to your tab.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.608
- Yeah, fine.

34:48.651 --> 34:50.871
- What do you want?

34:50.914 --> 34:53.439
- When you took my furniture...

34:53.482 --> 34:55.963
- I didn't take nothing.

34:56.006 --> 34:58.400
- How did you do it?

35:15.765 --> 35:18.116
- They don't know who it was.

35:18.159 --> 35:20.857
They completely took
everything.

35:23.904 --> 35:26.646
I'll call you back.

35:26.689 --> 35:29.301
- Oh, my God.
What happened?

35:29.344 --> 35:31.172
- What do you want?

35:31.216 --> 35:34.175
- Well, I wanted
to buy a hot tub place, but...

35:34.219 --> 35:37.396
this place doesn't have
any hot tubs.

35:37.439 --> 35:41.139
So...

35:41.182 --> 35:42.270
wow.

35:44.838 --> 35:49.147
Not what I was expecting,
you know?

35:49.190 --> 35:51.149
Uh...

35:53.238 --> 35:56.154
I mean...

35:56.197 --> 35:58.025
how's that?

36:00.158 --> 36:03.465
- We already agreed
on a number.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.946
- Well, yeah, but...

36:05.989 --> 36:07.121
that doesn't seem fair.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.949
I mean, why would I pay
that much

36:08.992 --> 36:10.646
when it's just
an empty showroom?

36:13.258 --> 36:16.217
I mean,
if you're not interested...

36:17.697 --> 36:19.786
- Sea lions, huh?

36:19.829 --> 36:21.266
- Oh, yeah.

36:21.309 --> 36:24.182
It's a whole marine life
series.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.852
- Let's go!

36:42.896 --> 36:44.463
- Hey.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.029
Those aren't church clothes.

36:46.073 --> 36:47.248
- We're not going to church.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.249
- You're not?

36:48.293 --> 36:50.164
Says who, Jesus?

36:50.208 --> 36:51.731
- Daddy.

36:51.774 --> 36:53.472
- He says we're going
go-karting.

36:53.515 --> 36:54.995
- Oh, yeah, they got so good
on your Jazzy,

36:55.038 --> 36:56.518
I figured it was time
to take it up a notch.

36:56.562 --> 36:57.650
Shoes.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.304
Shoes!
Put on your shoes!

37:05.048 --> 37:06.441
- They have Sunday school.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.704
- And the rest of their life
to be good.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.276
- Where's all that going?

37:15.320 --> 37:19.062
- I'm giving back.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.629
- To who?

37:20.673 --> 37:22.544
- The people who deserve it.

37:35.514 --> 37:37.559
Last chance.

37:39.735 --> 37:42.129
You were right.
- Oh, I know.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.872
- I don't know
where we're going.

37:45.915 --> 37:48.004
I just wanna go there together.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.150
- Looks like a star.

38:15.162 --> 38:18.383
Jackets, bathroom, car!

38:18.426 --> 38:21.342
Let's burn some rubber.

38:21.386 --> 38:23.388
Hmm.

38:25.651 --> 38:27.479
You already tried to return it,
didn't you?

38:27.522 --> 38:29.219
- Oh, yeah.
They were gonna hose me good.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.096
- Almost up and running, huh?

38:36.139 --> 38:38.185
- We had an issue
with the previous owner.

38:38.228 --> 38:40.753
- No, I love it.

38:42.232 --> 38:44.278
- You do?
- Yeah.

38:44.322 --> 38:48.369
Get away with anything you want
in a place like this.

38:48.413 --> 38:51.633
- Well, it'll look even better
when I get the spas back in.

38:51.677 --> 38:52.852
- Oh, yeah?

38:52.895 --> 38:55.028
- And the barbecue accessories.

38:55.071 --> 38:56.290
- Cool.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.161
I'll take a dip.

38:58.205 --> 39:00.120
- Okay.

39:00.163 --> 39:03.123
- You wanna join me?

39:03.166 --> 39:05.865
- I would be happy
to have a sales representative

39:05.908 --> 39:07.475
walk you through
all the features.

39:07.519 --> 39:10.565
- Nah.
Those things breed diseases.

39:11.958 --> 39:13.525
- When does it get to be mine?

39:13.568 --> 39:16.049
- When does what
get to be yours?

39:16.092 --> 39:18.312
