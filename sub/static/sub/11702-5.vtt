It's part of the new stress
management thing I'm doing.

00:08.590 --> 00:11.310
I found a... a journal. Fletch's journal.

00:11.390 --> 00:16.470
There was some stuff about him and
a previous governor, Meg Jackson.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.070
You haven't said anything,
have you, about Meg and I?

00:19.150 --> 00:20.230
Of course not.

00:20.310 --> 00:22.748
Because if he knew, he'd fuckin' kill me.

Carly in debt to the Holts.

send photos of the puppies.

herself tied up with the Holts.

for her to go to Thailand.

25:41.549 --> 25:42.789
Why do you keep doing that?

25:43.349 --> 25:44.509
(LAUGHING)

25:44.589 --> 25:47.109
Might as well make the most of
it while she's out of action.

25:47.189 --> 25:48.229
What's wrong with her?

25:50.389 --> 25:51.549
Who cares?

25:57.509 --> 25:59.229
You look shattered.

26:00.789 --> 26:03.149
- I didn't sleep well.
- Yeah, I'd be worried too, if I was you.

26:04.869 --> 26:05.989
Don't start that again.

26:07.429 --> 26:09.709
You know, Brayden will use
Carly if he's not already.

26:10.109 --> 26:12.149
I mean it. Shut up.

26:12.789 --> 26:15.389
What if he's seducing
her like he did Deb, hmm?

26:15.469 --> 26:17.749
Or getting her hooked on something?

26:17.829 --> 26:19.280
How do you know he's
not in Thailand with her,

26:19.281 --> 26:20.381
using her as a drug mule?

26:20.909 --> 26:25.349
She gets caught, she's in a
Thai prison for life. Or dead.

26:26.989 --> 26:28.869
Carly's not stupid like Deb was.

26:29.949 --> 26:31.229
(SCOFFS)

26:34.109 --> 26:36.749
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

26:46.909 --> 26:49.389
Why... why didn't you tell me, Mum?

26:50.429 --> 26:52.389
Is that why you haven't come to visit?

26:54.349 --> 26:57.389
No, it's just 'cause you
promised you'd visit, that's all.

26:57.709 --> 27:00.549
- Hey! Let me in for six smokes?
- All right.

27:00.629 --> 27:02.149
Don't you want to see me?

27:02.229 --> 27:04.269
- Hey, hurry up.
- Fuck off!

27:05.549 --> 27:07.029
Not you, Mum.

27:07.629 --> 27:08.749
Mum?

27:09.469 --> 27:10.589
Mum!

27:12.589 --> 27:14.189
You stupid bitch!

27:14.269 --> 27:16.029
I need to call my husband. It's important.

27:16.109 --> 27:17.189
- VERA: Hey!
- I don't give a shit.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.989
This way, girls. Simmo's
not using the phone anymore.

27:19.069 --> 27:21.189
- Oh, fuck!
- Jenkins! What's going on?

27:21.269 --> 27:24.109
Nothing. Nothin'. Simmo's
just finished, that's all.

27:24.469 --> 27:26.069
All right. Slater, back to your unit then.

27:26.149 --> 27:27.749
- You'll regret this.
- Yeah, I doubt it.

27:28.269 --> 27:30.829
- Jenkins, you too.
- That's a promise.

27:33.109 --> 27:34.709
Yeah, I'm going.

27:41.189 --> 27:42.189
DOR: Hey.

27:43.309 --> 27:44.829
Yeah, stick it on the
bed. I'll get it to Nash.

27:45.429 --> 27:47.029
I've worded up Smiles.

27:47.509 --> 27:52.069
- Thanks. Ah, don't read it.
- I won't. Don't wanna throw up.

27:52.429 --> 27:53.589
(LAUGHS)

27:53.669 --> 27:55.149
- Hey!
- Yeah?

27:55.229 --> 27:56.549
- Did you get what I wanted?
- Oh, yeah.

27:56.709 --> 27:58.349
(WOMAN SPEAKING OVER PA)

28:00.109 --> 28:02.869
- Booms!
- Oh, she's not in her cell.

28:03.509 --> 28:05.069
Come on, we gotta go.

28:05.589 --> 28:07.029
- Done?
- All good.

28:13.629 --> 28:15.669
(HUMMING)

28:19.229 --> 28:21.389
- You seen Booms?
- Nah.

28:22.189 --> 28:24.029
Hey, Lizzie. Liz!

28:24.109 --> 28:25.669
- Yeah?
- You seen Booms?

28:25.749 --> 28:28.389
No, not since breckie. Why?

28:28.469 --> 28:31.069
SKY: Maybe she's in
Medical, with her back?

28:31.149 --> 28:32.829
- What's wrong with her back?
- Oh, I don't know.

28:32.909 --> 28:35.749
She, like, pulled it
out, or something, eh.

28:39.749 --> 28:41.669
The dumb waiter's on the blink again.

28:41.749 --> 28:44.949
Yeah! Less work for us ladies. (CHUCKLES)

28:45.029 --> 28:46.709
The busier we are, the
quicker the day goes.

28:46.789 --> 28:52.109
Nah, you just need better
drugs, eh. Days fly by. Whoo!

28:52.189 --> 28:54.149
- Any of you know where Jenkins is?
- Nah.

28:54.229 --> 28:56.589
- Nah.
- OFFICER: (ON RADIO) Sierra 3 to Sierra 6.

28:56.669 --> 28:59.149
- She's not in her unit, or in Medical.
- Copy that.

28:59.389 --> 29:00.940
Sierra 6 to all officers,

29:00.941 --> 29:03.010
Sue Jenkins has failed to
report to the work unit.

29:03.019 --> 29:04.469
OFFICER: (ON RADIO) Roger, Sierra 6.

29:04.829 --> 29:06.989
OFFICER: (ON PA) Attention
compound, this is a lockdown.

29:07.069 --> 29:10.309
All women are to remain in
their units until further notice.

29:10.549 --> 29:14.709
Okay, everyone back to work. We'll
return you to your cells shortly.

29:17.909 --> 29:19.869
What have you done to her? Hmm?

29:19.949 --> 29:22.029
- Don't look at me.
- Huh?

29:22.109 --> 29:23.859
You went off at her in the phone queue.

29:23.860 --> 29:24.860
Said you were gonna get her.

29:24.869 --> 29:26.749
Oh, what would you know? You're
off your face most of the time.

29:26.949 --> 29:28.149
I know what I heard.

29:28.469 --> 29:31.189
Desperate to call your
old man, weren't ya, huh?

29:31.789 --> 29:35.309
- What's she talking about?
- Oh, don't listen to her. She's a junkie!

29:35.509 --> 29:37.909
- What have you done to her?
- Nothing, I swear.

29:37.989 --> 29:41.229
If you've done anything to hurt her,
you'll be leaving here in a body bag.

29:41.309 --> 29:43.509
- Hey, she didn't do anything, Franky.
- Hands off, Doyle.

29:46.229 --> 29:47.949
- We're good.
- Get back to work.

29:55.329 --> 29:57.969
I want a thorough search
before we contact police.

29:58.049 --> 30:00.769
We'll do the building first, then
get the prisoners back in their cells.

30:00.849 --> 30:02.969
Workmen were fixing the
security gate by the boiler room.

30:03.049 --> 30:04.849
- There could have been a breach.
- Check it out.

30:04.929 --> 30:07.529
- Vera, you'll handle Blocks A through D.
- Yes, Governor.

30:07.609 --> 30:11.889
Come with me. No, go ahead.
I'll catch up with you later.

30:12.449 --> 30:15.049
I was calling you last night. I
went to your house. Where were you?

30:16.289 --> 30:18.369
- Why the lockdown? What's...
- Jenkins is missing.

30:18.449 --> 30:20.249
What the hell were you thinking,
breaking into Will's house?

30:20.689 --> 30:22.729
- He almost called the police.
- What?

30:22.809 --> 30:25.049
- I didn't break into Will's house, Vera.
- He knows it was you.

30:27.049 --> 30:29.529
- He told me to leave it, so I did. I...
- JOAN: What's the hold up?

30:29.849 --> 30:31.369
(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah,
I'm on my way, Governor.

30:31.449 --> 30:33.169
Just stay away from him.

30:33.249 --> 30:36.649
- You're late.
- Ah, yeah, sorry, Governor.

30:36.729 --> 30:40.609
- Traffic was a bitch.
- You have trouble dressing this morning?

30:40.969 --> 30:42.209
Jenkins is missing.

30:44.929 --> 30:46.889
Workers were fixing the
gate in the boiler room.

30:46.969 --> 30:50.809
You'd better check it out. See
if there's been a breach, hmm?

30:59.489 --> 31:01.209
So, you tried calling Spitz?

31:01.809 --> 31:03.009
Yeah.

31:06.289 --> 31:08.569
Look, I'm sorry if I freaked you out.

31:08.649 --> 31:13.369
Oh, what's this, reverse psychology?

31:13.449 --> 31:16.009
No. Listen, when Deb was younger,

31:16.249 --> 31:20.489
I promised her that she would
live a really long and happy life.

31:24.249 --> 31:29.089
Brayden Holt took her before her
time, and that is why I want him dead.

31:29.369 --> 31:31.449
I understand, I really do.

31:32.409 --> 31:35.249
But Carly wouldn't get involved
with Brayden. Not like that.

31:44.489 --> 31:45.769
FRANKY: Sky.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.769
Miss Miles?

31:57.329 --> 31:58.769
Got something for ya.

32:01.089 --> 32:02.849
Stick with me and I can
get you whatever you want.

32:05.569 --> 32:07.329
I already told you, I'm
not joining anyone's crew.

32:08.529 --> 32:12.009
- Well, you saw it. I look after my girls.
- Yeah, I saw it.

32:13.049 --> 32:15.569
If that were true, you'd be worried
about Boomer right now, not yourself.

32:15.649 --> 32:18.209
Thank you, but they're
not my colors. Excuse me.

32:19.849 --> 32:21.929
OFFICER: (ON RADIO) Sierra
1 to Sierra 6, H4 is clear.

32:22.009 --> 32:24.529
- You can return the women to their unit.
- Roger that.

32:25.729 --> 32:27.849
Okay, H4. You can come with me.

32:27.929 --> 32:30.449
I'll be back for H2 when
we get the all clear.

32:30.529 --> 32:31.649
Come on.

32:34.529 --> 32:35.849
(CLANKING)

32:40.289 --> 32:43.769
Come on, Jenkins. Game's over. Let's go.

32:44.649 --> 32:46.689
Come on. Out you come.

32:51.809 --> 32:54.569
- She's not here.
- Listen, Vera told me about your house.

32:54.649 --> 32:56.369
- I had nothing to do with it, okay?
- Yeah.

32:56.449 --> 32:59.129
Just like you didn't send
those texts, or slash my tires.

32:59.209 --> 33:01.409
What are you talking about? I know
nothing about that. What texts?

33:01.849 --> 33:05.009
- Get out of my way.
- No... no, you're gonna hear me out, okay?

33:05.089 --> 33:06.489
You're gonna hear me out.

33:07.009 --> 33:10.009
What? Does your shrink want a few
more pages for your journal, huh?

33:10.089 --> 33:11.889
- So you read it then?
- I didn't read your fucking journal.

33:11.969 --> 33:15.449
- I didn't break into your fucking house!
- That's bullshit!

33:15.529 --> 33:17.209
It wasn't Meg that made
the first move, okay?

33:17.649 --> 33:20.769
Okay? It was me. It was all me.

33:21.689 --> 33:24.329
And I wouldn't take no for an answer.

33:25.969 --> 33:27.369
Why are you doing this, Fletch, eh?

33:28.409 --> 33:29.569
Do you want to be
punished, is that it, eh?

33:29.649 --> 33:30.849
Will that make your guilt go away?

33:30.929 --> 33:32.129
- Will it?
- Maybe.

33:32.209 --> 33:33.529
- Maybe? Maybe?
- Yeah.

33:33.609 --> 33:36.769
You wanna talk? Let's
fucking hear details then, eh?

33:36.849 --> 33:38.929
Let's hear details, Fletch, eh?

33:39.009 --> 33:41.489
How many times did you
fuck her, Fletch? Eh?

33:41.569 --> 33:42.722
How many times did you fuck her?

33:42.723 --> 33:44.623
Where did you do it? My place, your place?

33:44.669 --> 33:46.569
Did you blow on her?
Did she fuckin' like it?

33:46.649 --> 33:51.089
- You wanna talk, then fucking talk!
- It was half a dozen times. Okay?

33:51.169 --> 33:56.129
My place mostly. A few times in
the car, and once in an alleyway.

33:56.609 --> 34:00.169
An alleyway? So you and my
wife in a fucking alleyway, eh?

34:00.249 --> 34:02.329
Yeah, yeah it was great.
I really got off on it.

34:02.409 --> 34:03.769
(GRUNTING)

34:04.169 --> 34:07.769
Hit me. Come on. Come on.

34:07.849 --> 34:11.168
You know what? You're
not fuckin' worth it.

34:15.529 --> 34:17.969
You know that baby Meg got rid of?

34:19.649 --> 34:21.688
I reckon that was my baby.

34:22.329 --> 34:23.649
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

34:32.289 --> 34:33.529
(GROANS)

34:35.809 --> 34:37.649
Your daughter looked well yesterday.

34:37.728 --> 34:39.809
Yeah, she's excited. She's
going to Thailand on the weekend.

34:39.889 --> 34:40.889
Half her luck.

34:40.969 --> 34:42.688
(GRUNTING)

34:42.849 --> 34:44.569
I'd kill for a bit of romance in the sun.

34:44.649 --> 34:47.409
Oh, it's not that sort of holiday.
She hasn't got a boyfriend.

34:47.489 --> 34:49.929
Really? She was all
over him in the car park.

34:50.248 --> 34:53.728
- No, no, Carly was here with her dad.
- Yeah, but she left with someone else.

34:54.449 --> 34:55.728
I'm pretty sure it was Brayden Holt.

35:04.129 --> 35:05.169
Fuck you.

35:06.289 --> 35:07.569
(GRUNTING)

35:14.169 --> 35:15.369
(GASPING)

35:16.009 --> 35:17.049
(PANTING)

35:22.169 --> 35:24.209
(FLETCH COUGHING)

35:39.689 --> 35:40.809
What's wrong with her?

36:10.309 --> 36:11.549
Leave us.

36:11.629 --> 36:15.149
- I just need to finish this...
- It wasn't a suggestion.

36:20.229 --> 36:21.989
You lied to me.

36:22.189 --> 36:24.109
You said this was over.

36:26.189 --> 36:27.429
This cannot go on.

36:27.509 --> 36:30.509
If you find it impossible to control
your behavior, you should resign.

36:30.909 --> 36:33.389
(SCOFFS) I beg your pardon?

36:34.629 --> 36:36.749
You have an attitude
problem, Mr. Fletcher.

36:36.829 --> 36:39.149
Now I don't care if it's because
you missed out on the Governorship...

36:39.229 --> 36:41.629
If Will wants me to
leave, then I'll leave.

36:42.269 --> 36:44.469
But I'm not leaving
because you want me to.

36:46.749 --> 36:48.069
All right.

36:49.589 --> 36:51.029
Then we'll do it the hard way.

36:52.189 --> 36:55.549
You fire me, and I'll
go straight to Channing.

36:55.629 --> 36:56.869
I'll go straight to the Board.

36:58.029 --> 37:01.149
I'm the one sitting here
with the cuts and bruises.

37:01.229 --> 37:03.869
How's that gonna look, Governor, huh?

37:06.909 --> 37:10.709
You should be very careful how
you speak to me, Mr. Fletcher.

37:12.109 --> 37:14.349
Very careful indeed.

37:22.509 --> 37:24.949
The compound's still being searched,
so you'll be confined to your unit.

37:25.029 --> 37:26.269
Well, how long's that going to take?

37:26.349 --> 37:27.629
- Don't know.
- 'Cause I've got plans.

37:27.709 --> 37:31.149
I've got to fit in some shopping,
and a Brazilian wax before 5:00.

37:31.229 --> 37:33.909
- BOOMER: Liz!
- What's that?

37:34.109 --> 37:36.949
- (BANGING)
- Is that Booms?

37:37.029 --> 37:40.069
- Liz!
- It's her!

37:45.189 --> 37:46.629
(GROANING)

37:46.709 --> 37:48.749
(GASPING) Holy crap!

37:52.149 --> 37:54.069
Good day, Miss Miles. How's it goin'?

37:54.309 --> 37:57.109
Sierra 6 to Sierra 3, I've found Jenkins.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.749
Copy that, Sierra 6.

37:58.829 --> 38:01.629
- Miss Miles has got Jenkins.
- Vera, I heard.

38:01.709 --> 38:02.989
- Bring her up straight away.
- Yes, Governor.

38:03.069 --> 38:05.309
- Call off the search.
- Will do.

38:11.349 --> 38:12.869
Shut the door.

38:17.229 --> 38:19.229
I guess you can accept my resignation now.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.829
You are not the problem. Mr. Fletcher is.

38:23.909 --> 38:26.109
But your actions today
have complicated things.

38:26.629 --> 38:28.829
He now looks like the victim.

38:29.469 --> 38:30.789
I can't work with him anymore.

38:30.949 --> 38:34.029
You won't have to. I
will sort something out.

38:35.629 --> 38:36.949
I'm sorry.

38:37.989 --> 38:39.029
I'm better than this.

38:40.909 --> 38:43.309
- What?
- I am better than this.

38:45.189 --> 38:48.029
That's why I'm giving you one last chance.

39:03.989 --> 39:07.469
I need you to do me a
favor and burn that journal.

39:07.549 --> 39:08.749
You get this through your thick head.

39:09.029 --> 39:10.709
I don't have your journal.

39:10.789 --> 39:12.949
You come near my place
again, I will call the cops.

39:15.989 --> 39:19.309
Think about it. I would
have used the key, huh?

39:19.389 --> 39:20.589
The spare that's in the pot plant.

39:23.589 --> 39:25.109
If I was going to break
in, I might have used that.

39:29.949 --> 39:32.569
I was down there trying to fix the thing,

39:32.870 --> 39:35.120
and the door just shut on me.

39:35.069 --> 39:37.909
- What, all by itself?
- Yeah.

39:39.229 --> 39:42.469
Well, the officers searched that
area. Why didn't you call out before?

39:42.549 --> 39:45.389
'Cause I didn't want to get busted, did I?

39:45.909 --> 39:47.189
(CHUCKLES)

39:47.269 --> 39:50.069
- Who locked you in there?
- No one, I told ya!

39:50.869 --> 39:53.069
The laundry chute has been
playing up a bit lately.

39:53.149 --> 39:54.309
Yeah!

39:55.509 --> 39:58.589
I bet all the women are
laughing at me, aren't they?

39:58.669 --> 40:00.270
Oh, God, you know, it must be terrible,

40:00.271 --> 40:02.000
being the brunt of other people's jokes.

40:03.829 --> 40:07.789
I bet Franky only keeps you around
because, well, you're useful.

40:08.949 --> 40:11.709
She never even came forward and
expressed her concern, did she, Vera?

40:12.509 --> 40:15.989
You know, none of them did. None. None.

40:17.829 --> 40:19.509
You don't owe them anything, Jenkins.

40:20.909 --> 40:23.309
It's time you started
looking out for yourself.

40:24.389 --> 40:28.789
Now, you tell me how Franky is
bringing the contraband in here

40:28.869 --> 40:32.509
and I will move you to protection
with maximum privileges.

40:34.709 --> 40:35.989
What sort of privileges?

40:36.549 --> 40:41.229
Extra visits. Extra spend. Bigger TV.

40:42.429 --> 40:44.629
Maybe even a games console.

40:46.669 --> 40:49.509
Sonic the Hedgehog? 'Cause
I like Sonic the Hedgehog.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.389
You tell me what you know, Boomer.

40:54.349 --> 40:55.949
You can have whatever you want.

41:02.349 --> 41:03.869
Can you give us a minute?

41:03.949 --> 41:05.749
- Make it quick.
- Yeah.

41:05.909 --> 41:07.189
(SIGHS)

41:07.269 --> 41:08.589
You okay?

41:11.189 --> 41:12.709
Seen Ferguson?

41:14.909 --> 41:17.189
Don't worry, I didn't say nothin'.

41:17.749 --> 41:19.989
She's sending me to the slot.

41:20.829 --> 41:22.309
I missed ya.

41:27.829 --> 41:30.629
You locked yourself in there, didn't ya?

41:31.829 --> 41:33.549
Didn't know I'd get stuck in there, did I?

41:33.669 --> 41:34.909
- (BOTH LAUGHING)
- Doofus.

41:35.949 --> 41:37.349
Right, Jenkins, let's go.

41:37.429 --> 41:38.629
I know I've been busy,
but when you get out,

41:38.709 --> 41:40.269
- we'll have a proper chat, okay?
- Yeah.

41:40.349 --> 41:42.869
- Talk about your dumb arse sister.
- Ohh!

41:43.949 --> 41:45.349
Yeah?

41:46.309 --> 41:47.989
(WHISPERING) See ya. See ya.

42:10.429 --> 42:11.629
I'll get you the name.

42:13.349 --> 42:15.789
Someone who can take care of Brayden.

42:15.869 --> 42:17.709
What you do with it
after that is up to you.

42:27.309 --> 42:28.949
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

42:37.509 --> 42:39.589
- Hey.
- Hey, darls.

42:44.709 --> 42:46.509
Is Carly seeing Brayden?

42:48.549 --> 42:52.109
- What?
- You heard me. Is she seeing Brayden?

42:52.189 --> 42:55.149
She's a teenager. I
don't know what she does.

42:55.349 --> 42:56.469
Why?

42:59.829 --> 43:00.989
You got that name?

43:10.549 --> 43:14.669
Tell your mate to call her Uncle
Morgan, and tell her to be careful.

43:15.749 --> 43:17.429
What's Vinnie doing about getting me out?

43:18.309 --> 43:19.789
It's happening.

43:20.669 --> 43:21.949
Good.

43:22.029 --> 43:24.029
But he wants something in return.

43:24.669 --> 43:25.869
Bea Smith.

43:28.109 --> 43:29.469
I don't understand.

43:30.229 --> 43:33.509
The hit's still on. Vinnie wants her dead.

43:40.469 --> 43:41.749
And you're doing it.

43:48.749 --> 43:50.189
No.

44:05.149 --> 44:06.229
(INAUDIBLE)

44:07.909 --> 44:09.749
(INAUDIBLE)
