WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:04.666
You're hovering.

00:04.735 --> 00:06.602
Sorry. It's just...

00:06.687 --> 00:09.004
Are you setting the table
so nicely to be helpful

00:09.089 --> 00:10.789
or because of an urge you can't control?

00:10.874 --> 00:12.057
No wrong answer.

00:12.109 --> 00:14.393
For once in your life,
just leave me alone!

00:17.881 --> 00:20.148
She really took full advantage
of that "no wrong answer" waiver.

00:21.702 --> 00:24.069
Get that out of my face!

00:29.410 --> 00:31.076
Your drone is so easy to control.

00:31.128 --> 00:32.844
It's all about quality, amigo.

00:32.896 --> 00:34.646
This is the kind the CIA uses.

00:34.698 --> 00:35.948
I have the kind you get on sale

00:36.033 --> 00:38.634
that loses contact
with the remote at around 6 feet

00:38.702 --> 00:39.935
and then gets stuck in a tree.

00:40.020 --> 00:41.787
Oh, you got to get
one of these... it's 5 grand,

00:41.839 --> 00:42.955
camera included.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.640
5 grand? For a toy?

00:44.725 --> 00:46.141
Well, it's not so much.

00:46.210 --> 00:48.160
See, think about it... you'd
spend that on a purse, right?

00:48.195 --> 00:50.212
No, I wouldn't spend that on a car.

00:50.297 --> 00:51.847
Get this stupid thing out of my house

00:51.932 --> 00:53.398
and tell him to take his drone with him.

00:53.484 --> 00:55.867
Mom, you're not allowed to yell
at Cooper. He's a guest.

00:55.953 --> 00:58.186
Anyone who eats at my house
three times in a week

00:58.272 --> 00:59.888
is no longer a guest.

01:01.158 --> 01:02.758
Hi, guys.

01:02.843 --> 01:05.477
Hi, Mrs. Otto, Mr. Otto.
I like the sweater.

01:05.562 --> 01:06.812
Well, thank you, Eyo.

01:06.897 --> 01:08.130
I was thinking of getting rid of it.

01:08.215 --> 01:10.015
My shawl collars are often disparaged.

01:10.067 --> 01:12.200
Aw, don't listen to him. It's lit.

01:12.286 --> 01:13.869
No, it's not lit.

01:13.954 --> 01:15.170
He's just kissing your butt.

01:15.255 --> 01:17.773
Your sweater is a pox on this family.

01:17.858 --> 01:18.991
Eyo, what have you done?

01:19.076 --> 01:21.693
Hey, don't yell
at my boyfriend like that.

01:21.729 --> 01:23.111
I have a boyfriend.

01:23.197 --> 01:25.280
We're going upstairs to study.

01:25.566 --> 01:26.581
- What a sweet kid.
- Mm-hmm.

01:26.667 --> 01:28.133
Don't let his smile fool you.

01:28.218 --> 01:31.938
- Those two... it is on like Babylon.
- Nothing is on.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.313
Except for your stupid feet
on my furniture.

01:34.475 --> 01:35.941
What is wrong with you, man?

01:35.976 --> 01:39.077
Sorry. I just figured
since it wasn't fancy, I...

01:40.631 --> 01:42.214
Move slowly towards the door.

01:42.266 --> 01:43.899
Try not to show fear.

01:50.891 --> 01:53.358
Ooh, let's have my drone film us
cruising around on my Vespas.

01:53.427 --> 01:55.961
That is so much cooler
than undocumented bike riding.

01:55.996 --> 01:57.179
You've got the life.

01:57.264 --> 01:59.648
I'm like one of those kids
born in prison.

01:59.733 --> 02:02.167
The kid's a terrible influence on Oliver.

02:02.202 --> 02:04.236
- I'm worried about Anna-Kat.
- You're right.

02:04.321 --> 02:06.154
He's a terrible influence on her, too.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.706
You know what?

02:07.741 --> 02:10.058
I'm gonna get him to stop
hanging around this house.

02:10.144 --> 02:12.744
Why do you always get in feuds
with children?

02:12.780 --> 02:14.329
I should set up a meeting with Dr. Ellie

02:14.415 --> 02:15.380
- so we can talk about Anna-Kat.
- Mm-hmm.

02:17.584 --> 02:20.001
But, first, I'm gonna check in
on Taylor and Eyo

02:20.087 --> 02:21.636
and make sure it is not on like Babylon

02:21.722 --> 02:24.089
or any other ancient Mesopotamian city!

02:24.174 --> 02:27.059
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

02:30.814 --> 02:32.931
At least I get to see you one last time.

02:33.016 --> 02:34.850
No, no, please don't leave me.

02:34.935 --> 02:36.234
I love you.

02:36.270 --> 02:38.153
Belle, it's me.

02:38.238 --> 02:39.604
It is you.

02:42.025 --> 02:43.275
Dad!

02:43.360 --> 02:45.193
How's the studying going?

02:45.279 --> 02:46.778
I was just being the Beast.

02:46.830 --> 02:48.113
Yeah, I can see that.

02:48.198 --> 02:49.448
From "Beauty and the Beast."

02:49.500 --> 02:52.367
He was just helping me
rehearse a scene for drama club.

02:52.453 --> 02:53.952
Oh.

02:54.037 --> 02:55.670
Well.

02:55.756 --> 02:57.622
I'm gonna leave this open

02:57.674 --> 03:02.511
and sit a few feet from your door...

03:02.596 --> 03:04.179
as is my custom.

03:07.634 --> 03:08.967
And he thinks he can act
however he wants

03:09.019 --> 03:11.937
because his family's rich,
and it's rubbing off on Anna-Kat.

03:11.972 --> 03:14.723
Plus, he was one of those faces
you just want to punch.

03:14.808 --> 03:16.235
Well, let's call Anna-Kat in

03:16.259 --> 03:17.527
and ask her what she thinks.

03:17.528 --> 03:20.479
Cooper Bradford has nothing
to do with how I've been acting.

03:20.531 --> 03:22.447
Typically, children in the hall

03:22.471 --> 03:23.900
don't overhear what's said

03:23.901 --> 03:27.536
because the parents...
aren't quite so loud.

03:27.621 --> 03:30.205
It's you guys... you're always
watching me and whispering.

03:30.290 --> 03:32.874
Am I washing my hands too much
or too little?

03:32.960 --> 03:36.461
Am I exhibiting "behaviors"?

03:36.497 --> 03:37.963
We also whisper too loud.

03:37.998 --> 03:40.332
I'm turning 8, and you're
treating me like I'm a toddler.

03:40.384 --> 03:43.335
I think Anna-Kat is conveying
a legitimate feeling.

03:43.420 --> 03:45.170
- Damn right.
- I've got this.

03:45.222 --> 03:49.090
You're overconcern
may be fueling her anxiety.

03:49.176 --> 03:50.258
What do you suggest?

03:50.344 --> 03:52.010
Fight the urge to help her so much.

03:52.095 --> 03:53.645
Give her a little more independence.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.014
Hmm. Is that what you would like?

03:57.234 --> 03:58.233
Yeah.

03:58.318 --> 04:00.268
Okay.

04:00.354 --> 04:03.155
Daddy and I will try
to give you more space.

04:07.277 --> 04:09.027
I still think it's Cooper Bradford.

04:09.112 --> 04:11.363
It's not Cooper Bradford!

04:11.415 --> 04:12.864
I got to work on my whisper.

04:16.003 --> 04:18.036
Okay. Here is your class.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.171
Have a good day, honey.

04:19.206 --> 04:20.505
Why don't you take that sweatshirt off?

04:20.557 --> 04:22.307
Or keep it on...
I'll leave it up to you.

04:22.376 --> 04:23.808
Get your own apartment if you want.

04:30.184 --> 04:31.683
Katie, wait up!

04:31.752 --> 04:34.085
<i>Holly Kent... over-involved class mom.</i>

04:34.154 --> 04:35.554
<i>She only has one kid,</i>

04:35.589 --> 04:37.439
<i>so she's super optimistic
and full of life.</i>

04:37.524 --> 04:38.740
<i>I have no patience for that.</i>

04:38.825 --> 04:40.242
I'm so glad I caught you.

04:40.327 --> 04:42.260
I just wanted to return
the Tupperware you dropped off.

04:42.296 --> 04:44.596
Thanks.

04:44.681 --> 04:47.165
Anna-Kat's birthday cupcakes
are still in here.

04:47.201 --> 04:49.851
Yeah, they're in violation
of the class snack code.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.304
Gluten's a non-starter.
It's an allergen.

04:52.389 --> 04:54.906
No, it's not.
That whole thing is made up.

04:54.992 --> 04:56.458
There was no such thing as gluten-free

04:56.543 --> 04:58.426
when I was a kid, and guess what.

04:58.512 --> 04:59.811
Nobody died from Wonder Bread.

04:59.846 --> 05:02.614
Well, that was a long, long time ago.

05:02.666 --> 05:04.082
It wasn't that long ago.

05:04.134 --> 05:06.651
Just give them the cupcakes
and mind your own business.

05:06.687 --> 05:09.154
The safety of our children
is my business.

05:09.206 --> 05:10.739
You'd really be willing
to take the chance

05:10.824 --> 05:12.307
that a child's throat would close up

05:12.392 --> 05:14.426
and they'd die
right in front of your eyes

05:14.478 --> 05:16.595
for a cupcake?

05:16.663 --> 05:19.214
Oh, my God. She's right.

05:19.299 --> 05:20.498
Dr. Ellie is right.

05:20.550 --> 05:22.350
Now I know firsthand how Anna-Kat feels

05:22.436 --> 05:24.936
being smothered by ridiculous,
hysterical over-parenting.

05:24.988 --> 05:26.571
It's the worst.

05:26.657 --> 05:30.358
Holly, thank you for being
so terrible, truly.

05:30.444 --> 05:31.893
Thank you.

05:38.552 --> 05:41.019
<i>You have, like,</i>

05:41.071 --> 05:43.121
<i>perfectly symmetrical nostrils.</i>

05:43.206 --> 05:46.308
I mean, it's kind of my thing, so...

05:46.393 --> 05:47.976
<i>What else is your thing?</i>

05:48.061 --> 05:49.311
Well...

05:49.379 --> 05:51.529
Check out my symmetrical
flaring nostrils.

05:51.598 --> 05:52.931
Dad!

05:52.983 --> 05:55.100
<i>Hey, love your shoes, Mr. Otto.</i>

05:55.185 --> 05:56.584
Really? Well, th...

05:56.670 --> 05:58.203
I see what you're doing.

06:04.828 --> 06:06.077
How's the studying going?

06:06.129 --> 06:07.629
- Just finished.
- Great.

06:07.714 --> 06:09.047
Cooper, time to go.

06:09.099 --> 06:10.415
But before you do, head downstairs

06:10.484 --> 06:12.150
- and load the dishwasher.
- For real?

06:12.202 --> 06:14.869
You want to hang at my house,
you're doing chores.

06:18.225 --> 06:21.960
A chore is manual labor
that you do around the house.

06:21.995 --> 06:23.044
Hmm, interesting.

06:23.130 --> 06:24.462
Yeah.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.116
Hi.

06:28.201 --> 06:31.336
We're not checking in on you,
just saying hi.

06:31.371 --> 06:32.637
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:32.673 --> 06:34.222
So we thought, since you were turning 8,

06:34.308 --> 06:36.891
you might want to have a say
on what we do for your birthday.

06:39.413 --> 06:42.414
I'd like to have a candy-themed party.

06:42.466 --> 06:44.632
Candy it is.

06:44.718 --> 06:47.369
And for my present,
you promised when I turned 8,

06:47.437 --> 06:50.872
I could walk to the library
all by myself.

06:50.957 --> 06:53.425
Mommy said that?

06:53.460 --> 06:55.844
Maybe you're not remembering correctly.

06:55.929 --> 06:58.897
I was 5 and 3/4, and we were
sitting on the front lawn.

06:58.982 --> 07:01.666
You were wearing that purple
sweater with the missing button.

07:01.702 --> 07:03.301
There were big, fluffy clouds.

07:03.337 --> 07:04.719
You said one looked like Dan Aykroyd,

07:04.805 --> 07:06.921
and I said I didn't know who that was.

07:07.007 --> 07:08.940
A car with a Florida
license plate drove by,

07:08.975 --> 07:10.642
- and you said one looks...
- Okay, so you remember.

07:10.694 --> 07:13.445
I've been dreaming
of this day ever since.

07:13.480 --> 07:17.982
Well, then, a walk alone
to the library it is.

07:18.068 --> 07:19.317
Yes!

07:19.403 --> 07:22.987
Taylor, I think I just became a tween!

07:23.040 --> 07:25.156
- Are you crazy?!
- Don't be mad at me.

07:25.242 --> 07:26.458
Be mad at past Katie.

07:26.493 --> 07:28.076
She's the idiot who signed off on it.

07:28.161 --> 07:29.994
We can't let Anna-Kat wander
the streets alone,

07:30.080 --> 07:31.663
even if the library
is a few blocks away.

07:31.715 --> 07:34.833
Well, Dr. Ellie made us promise
not to be overprotective.

07:34.885 --> 07:36.334
I don't see how we can say no.

07:36.420 --> 07:37.886
You put us in a terrible situation.

07:37.971 --> 07:39.888
Again, not me... past Katie.

07:39.973 --> 07:41.222
That girl was all sorts of trouble.

07:41.308 --> 07:42.841
Sorry about the plate.

07:42.893 --> 07:44.592
I assume it wasn't expensive.

07:44.678 --> 07:48.012
Is it okay to hate a 13-year-old?

07:48.098 --> 07:51.182
Oliver, I think I just became a tween!

07:56.588 --> 07:59.580
Is letting Anna-Kat walk by
herself really such a big deal?

07:59.691 --> 08:01.991
I mean, when I was a kid,
I would run all around the neighborhood,

08:02.026 --> 08:03.709
and my parents had no idea where I was.

08:03.795 --> 08:05.778
Same with me.
My parents weren't worried.

08:05.863 --> 08:07.630
Actually, I think my mom
was slightly bummed

08:07.665 --> 08:08.998
when I showed up again at night.

08:09.083 --> 08:10.399
I had no freedom at all.

08:10.468 --> 08:13.035
My parents sucked the joy
right out of my childhood.

08:13.087 --> 08:15.004
Isn't that how
you raise your children now?

08:15.039 --> 08:16.922
Mm-hmm. Why should they get off so easy?

08:16.991 --> 08:19.241
Ugh. I'd love to bring my kids
up the way I was raised,

08:19.310 --> 08:20.743
but Celeste won't have it.

08:20.778 --> 08:24.013
She watches their every move
and has turned them into wusses.

08:24.048 --> 08:25.281
I say, "Go play in the backyard,"

08:25.316 --> 08:27.216
and they say,
"You want us to be kidnapped

08:27.251 --> 08:29.935
and grow up in a hole
in the ground chained to a bed?"

08:30.021 --> 08:31.821
- Some days I do.
- But it's not right.

08:31.873 --> 08:33.506
We should let our kids be kids...

08:33.591 --> 08:36.708
ride bikes, climb trees,
throw sticks at alligators.

08:38.129 --> 08:40.462
- It's a Florida thing.
- Oh, absolutely.

08:40.515 --> 08:41.881
The less supervision we give them,

08:41.966 --> 08:43.299
the more self-reliant they become.

08:43.351 --> 08:44.433
It's called "free-range parenting."

08:44.519 --> 08:46.369
No, no, no. It's free-range chicken.

08:46.454 --> 08:48.170
You are not even trying
to pay attention.

08:48.256 --> 08:49.855
I am half-listening.

08:49.941 --> 08:52.124
Statistically, it's safer today
than it was 20 years ago.

08:52.210 --> 08:54.443
And Westport is a very safe town, right?

08:54.479 --> 08:56.278
- Absolutely.
- So what's the verdict?

08:56.347 --> 08:58.631
Are you let Anna-Kat walk
to the library all by herself?

08:58.716 --> 09:01.667
If I don't let her do this,
I'm as bad as Holly Kent.

09:01.753 --> 09:04.320
She's creating a community garden
to bring together our children

09:04.355 --> 09:05.988
and the residents
of the Westport Retirement Home.

09:06.074 --> 09:08.321
She needs to get a life.

09:13.364 --> 09:15.164
- Granola bar?
- Yeah.

09:17.318 --> 09:19.268
Mnh, no bueno.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.871
Hey, I don't know what you do
in your house.

09:21.939 --> 09:23.639
- Oh, it's more of an estate.
- Excuse me?

09:23.725 --> 09:25.441
Well, there are several houses
on the property.

09:25.510 --> 09:26.726
It's called "Juniper Hill."

09:26.794 --> 09:28.344
And there's this dude who
welcomes you at the gate.

09:28.379 --> 09:29.545
- Maurice.
- Right, Maurice.

09:29.630 --> 09:32.548
He says, "Welcome to Juniper Hill,"

09:32.600 --> 09:34.417
- and then gives you an iced tea, right?
- Stop talking.

09:34.469 --> 09:37.019
I don't care what kind
of fancy-ass hill you live on.

09:37.071 --> 09:39.572
Here at the Otto Estate,
we don't waste food.

09:41.042 --> 09:42.091
Finish it.

09:42.143 --> 09:43.776
Wait. Is she serious?

09:43.861 --> 09:45.895
Mom, this is why
no one ever waves us over

09:45.963 --> 09:47.179
to join them at the beach.

09:47.265 --> 09:49.949
If he wants to be in our house,
he lives by our rules.

09:54.572 --> 09:56.255
Dude, just eat it, man.

09:59.393 --> 10:01.277
When you're done with that,
I want you two morons

10:01.329 --> 10:02.778
to hang these in the trees,

10:02.864 --> 10:05.881
where the candy-cane forest is gonna be
for Anna-Kat's birthday.

10:05.933 --> 10:07.399
Why isn't your party planner doing that?

10:07.485 --> 10:10.102
Oh, I don't hire party planners,
and I don't hire hitmen.

10:10.188 --> 10:11.937
I do all the work myself.

10:12.023 --> 10:13.022
You feel me?

10:19.097 --> 10:20.212
Talk to your wife.

10:20.281 --> 10:22.531
She made my friend eat
out of the garbage.

10:22.617 --> 10:24.800
- What? Care to explain?
- Nah.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:33.911 --> 10:35.077
What are you doing?

10:35.146 --> 10:36.212
Playing Red Rover.

10:36.264 --> 10:37.763
Come on, Eyo.

10:43.771 --> 10:45.721
Care to explain that?

10:45.790 --> 10:48.124
- Nah.
- She's 15, Greg. She's pretty.

10:48.209 --> 10:49.558
She's got my face and my body

10:49.594 --> 10:51.577
before the misery
of childbirth ruined it.

10:51.662 --> 10:53.646
It was only a matter of time
before she got a boyfriend.

10:53.714 --> 10:54.930
And as boyfriends go...

10:54.966 --> 10:56.315
I just don't like
the pace it's going at.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.834
- She's growing up.
- Well, shut that down.

10:58.870 --> 11:01.387
Love this irrational,
protective side of you.

11:01.472 --> 11:03.689
And while we're on the subject,
I talked to the girls,

11:03.774 --> 11:05.024
and Angela says, statistically,

11:05.109 --> 11:06.458
kids are safer than when we were young.

11:06.544 --> 11:07.593
Made me feel better

11:07.678 --> 11:09.178
about my promise I made to Anna-Kat.

11:09.263 --> 11:11.497
Statistics mean nothing if
something happens to your kid.

11:12.967 --> 11:15.050
You're right. What was I thinking?

11:15.102 --> 11:17.253
Sending her out into the forest
like Little Red Riding Hood.

11:17.288 --> 11:19.388
That sweet little story
ended in identify theft

11:19.457 --> 11:20.689
and a double murder.

11:20.725 --> 11:21.941
Oh, God.

11:22.026 --> 11:24.410
How do we tell
our tragedy-obsessed daughter

11:24.495 --> 11:25.628
that we're too afraid of the world

11:25.663 --> 11:28.147
to let her walk
a few blocks to the library?

11:28.232 --> 11:30.182
Well, let's just lie to her.

11:30.268 --> 11:31.667
You've gotten on board with lying.

11:31.752 --> 11:33.853
Finally, something we can do
as a couple.

11:35.907 --> 11:37.973
We were all set
to let you walk to the library

11:38.009 --> 11:39.975
- after school tomorrow.
- All set.

11:40.011 --> 11:42.578
But I didn't know the rules
that this town has.

11:42.663 --> 11:44.547
Apparently, in Westport,
you have to be 10 years old

11:44.599 --> 11:45.981
to walk across the street by yourself.

11:46.033 --> 11:48.167
- We're sick about it.
- So sick.

11:48.252 --> 11:52.021
But we don't want you
to go to jail, so...

11:53.875 --> 11:55.791
How about if you walk me
across the street

11:55.877 --> 11:57.810
in front of our house?

11:57.895 --> 11:59.762
- Come again?
- Then I can make it to the library

11:59.847 --> 12:01.497
without crossing another street.

12:01.582 --> 12:02.965
Problem solved.

12:03.017 --> 12:05.568
Problem solved, Greg.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.286
Great job.

12:08.206 --> 12:11.140
I should never have lied.
Nana was right.

12:11.175 --> 12:13.442
If you're feeling unsure
about anything at all,

12:13.494 --> 12:15.494
you can always ring
a neighbor's doorbell.

12:15.580 --> 12:17.963
The Lintons live there,
the Sealanders there.

12:18.049 --> 12:19.265
They're the Bumgarners.

12:19.350 --> 12:20.766
Best skip that house.

12:20.851 --> 12:23.652
Whenever our recycling bin
overflows, I put it in theirs.

12:23.738 --> 12:26.088
They've caught me like three times.

12:26.123 --> 12:27.690
- Got it.
- Okay,

12:27.725 --> 12:29.725
let's say a van pulls up
and a very nice person says

12:29.777 --> 12:32.024
he has your favorite type
of candy and invites you inside.

12:32.056 --> 12:33.712
- What do you do?
- Does he have Pop Rocks?

12:33.736 --> 12:35.634
- Anna-Kat!
- Kidding.

12:35.767 --> 12:38.167
I do what you taught me...
no, go, yell, tell.

12:38.202 --> 12:40.719
I say no, run away as fast as I can,

12:40.805 --> 12:43.455
yell my head off,
and then tell a trusted adult.

12:43.541 --> 12:45.374
Good. And that goes for anyone

12:45.459 --> 12:48.010
stopping to ask for directions
or offers to give you a ride

12:48.062 --> 12:49.561
or asks if you want to get in
their car and pet their puppy.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.413
- How cute is the puppy?
- Anna-Kat!

12:51.499 --> 12:52.915
Kidding.

12:52.967 --> 12:54.683
You guys are too easy.

12:54.769 --> 12:57.236
Okay, well, so, the library
is just right up there.

12:57.321 --> 12:59.171
Easy peasy.

12:59.257 --> 13:00.506
Easy peasy.

13:00.591 --> 13:02.558
Okay. What's your info?

13:02.643 --> 13:05.160
Phone number... 203-555-0145.

13:05.246 --> 13:08.931
Address... 23 Woody Lane,
Westport, Connecticut, 06880.

13:08.983 --> 13:10.532
- Perfect.
- Okay.

13:10.568 --> 13:12.885
Trial run's over.
You go back to the house.

13:12.970 --> 13:14.637
I'm ready to go it alone.

13:17.191 --> 13:18.791
She's ready.

13:18.876 --> 13:19.875
Yeah, but are we?

13:19.961 --> 13:22.478
I don't know. I'm so drained.

13:22.563 --> 13:24.346
Kids should really come
with a warning...

13:24.415 --> 13:25.848
do not have kids.

13:28.386 --> 13:29.818
Anna-Kat is on her way.

13:29.870 --> 13:32.571
Good side... we're not
those crazy helicopter parents.

13:32.657 --> 13:34.306
Bad side... we let our favorite child...

13:34.392 --> 13:35.641
You're not even hiding it anymore.

13:35.726 --> 13:37.693
...go out into the big,
scary world by herself.

13:37.728 --> 13:39.628
- How can we do that?
- We're not.

13:39.664 --> 13:41.630
- How we coming, boys?
- It's up and running.

13:41.716 --> 13:43.432
We're following her with Cooper's drone.

13:43.467 --> 13:45.818
That's brilliant.

13:45.903 --> 13:47.453
Okay, we got eyes on her.

13:47.538 --> 13:49.788
There's my baby! She's alive!

13:49.874 --> 13:51.040
Oh, no, her shoelace is untied.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.758
She's gonna trip and crack her...

13:52.843 --> 13:54.626
Oh, she didn't need us to tell her.

13:54.712 --> 13:56.345
She's doing it on her own.

13:56.397 --> 13:59.848
I think this was a good decision.

13:59.934 --> 14:02.518
Oh, hey, there's Taylor and Eyo.

14:04.989 --> 14:07.523
Yeah, follow them.

14:07.608 --> 14:09.658
- What are you doing?
- Dad, that's not the mission.

14:11.195 --> 14:13.195
What the hell?

14:13.280 --> 14:15.948
Told you... it is on like James Caan.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.833
- It is.
- Greg, it's fine.

14:17.868 --> 14:19.668
- Keep your eyes on...
- That is not lit.

14:19.704 --> 14:21.036
Greg, stop!

14:23.941 --> 14:24.840
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

14:26.877 --> 14:29.545
Nice work, Greg.
Anna-Kat's off the radar.

14:29.630 --> 14:32.431
Why couldn't you let Eyo
play a little grab-ass?

14:32.516 --> 14:35.851
That drone was $5,000.

14:35.886 --> 14:38.020
We'll call it even for the broken plate.

14:45.782 --> 14:47.949
I'm calling the library
to make sure she made it okay.

14:49.753 --> 14:51.219
I'd be more worried about Taylor.

14:51.304 --> 14:52.687
You crashed a drone into her.

14:52.772 --> 14:54.872
Hi. I was wondering
if my daughter was there.

14:54.941 --> 14:59.160
She's 8, cute.
She's got red Converse sneakers.

14:59.195 --> 15:00.745
She's there. Oh.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.664
- Thank you.
- She made it!

15:05.085 --> 15:07.068
- Oh.
- This is so ridiculous.

15:07.153 --> 15:08.386
She walked a few blocks,
and we're celebrating

15:08.471 --> 15:09.637
like the French when Lindbergh landed.

15:09.673 --> 15:10.805
I know!

15:10.890 --> 15:12.690
Wasn't he the guy
whose kid got snatched?

15:14.728 --> 15:16.294
Go clean the toilets, Cooper.

15:16.363 --> 15:18.913
Dude, she's serious.

15:26.256 --> 15:27.705
You're home!

15:29.359 --> 15:32.160
Oh! I'm finally glad you learned
to stop smothering me.

15:32.212 --> 15:33.878
How was your walk?

15:33.964 --> 15:35.663
- Great.
- I'm so glad.

15:35.749 --> 15:38.883
Until a car started driving
next to me real slow.

15:38.969 --> 15:40.852
- What?
- And then the window rolled down.

15:40.937 --> 15:43.037
- Who was it?
- Me.

15:43.089 --> 15:45.223
I followed her to make sure
she made it home safely.

15:45.224 --> 15:46.565
Thank you.

15:46.590 --> 15:50.261
I can't believe you let an 8-year-old girl
wander the streets all by herself.

15:50.347 --> 15:53.147
Technically, I'm still 7.

15:53.199 --> 15:56.551
What kind of mother are you?

15:56.636 --> 15:58.603
A gluten-feeding, non-grape-cutting,

15:58.688 --> 16:00.321
"letting them swim
right after they've eaten"

16:00.407 --> 16:03.174
mother of three who slams
the door on know-it-all moms.

16:03.259 --> 16:05.793
Leave me alone!

16:07.213 --> 16:09.864
That's how you deal with weirdos
who follow you home.

16:09.899 --> 16:11.149
Got it.

16:18.108 --> 16:21.292
<i>Apparently, Holly Kent
told everyone I'm a terrible mom.</i>

16:21.378 --> 16:23.144
<i>I hope she has another kid</i>

16:23.179 --> 16:26.180
<i>and they try for a third
and they end up with twins.</i>

16:26.232 --> 16:28.583
<i>I love it when that happens.</i>

16:28.618 --> 16:30.635
- Katie.
- Tara.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.321
So we'll be seeing Autumn
at Anna-Kat's birthday party?

16:33.406 --> 16:35.490
Yes, and I'll be there, as well.

16:35.558 --> 16:36.708
It's a drop-off party.

16:36.793 --> 16:38.026
If I wanted an adult party,

16:38.061 --> 16:39.610
I would throw one and not invite you.

16:39.696 --> 16:42.430
Yeah, well, I'm not leaving
my child unsupervised.

16:42.465 --> 16:43.931
She's not going to be unsupervised.

16:44.017 --> 16:45.116
Greg and I will be there.

16:45.201 --> 16:47.168
We don't trust you
to look after our children.

16:47.220 --> 16:49.520
- "We"?
- Yes, we.

16:51.241 --> 16:54.375
<i>Aw, man. Why don't I ever
have a crew behind me anymore?</i>

16:54.427 --> 16:57.562
<i>Five or six Cuban girls would
come in real handy right now.</i>

17:06.021 --> 17:07.405
Look at all this sugar.

17:07.490 --> 17:09.589
What's the theme of this party...
type 2 diabetes?

17:09.659 --> 17:10.958
Just being around it

17:11.010 --> 17:13.310
makes me want to go
to a sweat lodge in Sedona.

17:13.378 --> 17:15.029
What kind of mother allows this?

17:15.065 --> 17:16.497
The kind of mother that allows her child

17:16.566 --> 17:18.332
to roam the streets by herself.

17:18.417 --> 17:20.885
Autumn! You know better.

17:20.970 --> 17:22.487
Sugar kills.

17:22.571 --> 17:24.172
It's a Pixy Stick, Tara.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.374
Maybe if you pulled the stick
out of your...

17:26.425 --> 17:29.360
Tara, hi. I'm so glad
you and Autumn could make it.

17:29.446 --> 17:31.028
- Hey, Mom.
- Hola, Mrs. Otto.

17:31.114 --> 17:33.064
Oh, great. You're still here?

17:33.133 --> 17:34.165
Don't you have a home?

17:34.250 --> 17:36.017
Seven of them... Aspen, Lake Como...

17:36.102 --> 17:39.153
Shut up. Go finish landscaping
Lollipop Lane.

17:40.874 --> 17:43.925
Cooper, are your parents
at their home in Gstaad?

17:43.977 --> 17:46.110
Oh, it has a moat,
so technically it's a castle.

17:46.196 --> 17:48.196
Well, tell them we miss
seeing them at the club.

17:48.248 --> 17:50.181
But I miss them the most. I'm Sage.

17:52.552 --> 17:54.368
I love how everyone kisses your ass

17:54.404 --> 17:56.571
because your parents
are the richest people in town.

17:56.623 --> 17:57.839
Yeah, it's pretty deluxe.

17:57.924 --> 18:00.224
Grown men call me "sir."

18:00.310 --> 18:02.693
- I don't see Eyo. When's he coming?
- He's not.

18:02.779 --> 18:04.745
- And I have you to thank for it.
- Me?

18:04.798 --> 18:06.964
We both know this relationship
is a bad idea.

18:07.033 --> 18:08.816
I appreciate you scaring him off.

18:08.902 --> 18:12.053
Oh, you just had to go ahead
and agree with me

18:12.088 --> 18:13.921
and ruin everything.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.663
I heard Eyo's not coming.

18:24.300 --> 18:27.568
- It's my fault.
- Yeah, it is.

18:27.637 --> 18:29.270
Look, I think Eyo is a great kid,

18:29.355 --> 18:30.905
but you have to understand
what it's like

18:30.940 --> 18:32.840
when you see your little girl
with her first boyfriend.

18:32.876 --> 18:34.542
It's not easy for me.

18:34.577 --> 18:35.943
But I'm not a little girl.

18:35.979 --> 18:37.228
I know.

18:37.313 --> 18:40.414
But I have to start
getting used to that.

18:40.466 --> 18:41.616
I just want to make sure

18:41.701 --> 18:43.701
that you're making the right decisions
and not going too fast.

18:43.786 --> 18:48.005
Dad, I got it. You have to trust me.

18:48.074 --> 18:50.541
You're right. I do.

18:54.130 --> 18:55.112
Dad?

18:56.266 --> 18:58.866
Thanks for looking out for me.

18:58.918 --> 19:01.552
And don't worry...
sex is not on the table.

19:01.638 --> 19:04.639
Sex was on the table?
I was worried about second base.

19:06.192 --> 19:07.742
Since I'm now 8,

19:07.777 --> 19:09.927
I'm allowed to walk
to the library all by myself.

19:10.013 --> 19:11.012
How cool is that?

19:11.097 --> 19:13.181
- Awesome!
- No way!

19:14.918 --> 19:16.834
I want to walk to the library alone.

19:16.920 --> 19:17.952
Me, too.

19:18.004 --> 19:20.188
- No way.
- Absolutely not.

19:20.223 --> 19:22.056
I wouldn't be a good parent
if I let you.

19:22.141 --> 19:23.991
That's it. I don't want
to ruin Anna-Kat's party,

19:24.077 --> 19:25.326
but I'm not gonna stand by...

19:25.378 --> 19:28.296
Hey! You can't talk about
Mrs. Otto that way.

19:28.381 --> 19:31.782
Do you have any idea on what
type of mother Mrs. Otto is?

19:31.868 --> 19:34.919
Sure, she might come across
as rude and sarcastic

19:35.004 --> 19:38.139
- and uncultured and...
- Move to your next point.

19:38.174 --> 19:40.608
But Mrs. Otto is the best mom in town.

19:40.660 --> 19:42.276
I mean, look at this party.

19:42.328 --> 19:43.961
She did it all by herself

19:44.047 --> 19:46.898
without a party planner
or nannies or chefs.

19:46.983 --> 19:49.317
Who here can say
that they've ever done that?

19:49.402 --> 19:50.985
Heck, my last five birthdays,

19:51.037 --> 19:53.120
my parents haven't even been
in the country.

19:53.156 --> 19:55.289
She doesn't care how rich my family is.

19:55.325 --> 19:57.658
And she doesn't kiss up to me
like the rest of you.

19:57.710 --> 20:01.045
She calls me on my crap,
which I kind of like.

20:01.130 --> 20:02.546
It means that she cares.

20:02.632 --> 20:04.498
So, everyone, calm down.

20:04.550 --> 20:07.468
She let her daughter walk
to the library by herself.

20:07.503 --> 20:08.836
Big whoop.

20:08.888 --> 20:11.005
Now, leave her alone
or you're all off the list

20:11.057 --> 20:12.556
for the Juniper Hill Winter Gala.

20:14.143 --> 20:15.176
Comprende?

20:18.598 --> 20:20.064
Okay, cake time.

20:20.149 --> 20:21.015
Who wants gluten?!

20:22.237 --> 20:24.318
Hey, hey!

20:31.033 --> 20:33.536
Hey, Oliver, come get ready.

20:33.669 --> 20:35.385
We're taking the whole family
out to dinner.

20:35.420 --> 20:36.720
Oh, you should try Lonergan's on Elm.

20:36.755 --> 20:40.006
They have this Kobe steak
that's dry-aged for 125 days.

20:40.092 --> 20:42.893
Mm. We're going to
the Spaghetti Hut in Norwalk,

20:42.928 --> 20:45.428
where the meatballs
are also aged 120 days,

20:45.514 --> 20:48.315
but that's not on purpose.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.150
Well, I better be getting home then.

20:50.235 --> 20:51.601
Where the hell are you going?

20:51.687 --> 20:55.105
I said the whole family.

20:55.157 --> 20:57.490
But first, get your stupid Vespa
off my lawn,

20:57.576 --> 20:58.858
or I'll kill you.
