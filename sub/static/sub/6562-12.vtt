IS NOT THE WAY

02:11.665 --> 02:12.900

STOP.
IT'S CREEPING ME OUT.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.393

- NOOOOO!

02:44.765 --> 02:46.667
[all clamoring]

02:46.700 --> 02:49.803
- WRITING A SONG IS
THE NEXT STEP FOR US AS A BAND.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.205
- YEAH, COME ON, GUSTAVO.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.206

IN COMPLETE SILENCE FOR HOURS,

02:58.312 --> 03:01.249

TO FIND THAT KILLER HOOK?

03:04.918 --> 03:06.954
HUH? ARE YA?

03:06.987 --> 03:08.922
- YOU COULD WRITE THE SONG
WITH US.

03:08.956 --> 03:09.957
- NO!

03:09.990 --> 03:12.426
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE DOGS,

03:12.460 --> 03:14.328
AND I AM THE LONE
SONGWRITING WOLF.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.663

03:26.707 --> 03:28.809
- BUT AT LEAST WE GET TO RELAX
HERE AT THE PALM WOODS

03:28.842 --> 03:31.379
WHILE GUSTAVO "CREATES"
IN THE STUDIO.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.946
- WHAT IF IT WAS
THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

03:32.980 --> 03:34.715
- I SMELL PLAN.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.984
- OOH!
ALL OUR PLANS ARE PURE GENIUS.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.087
- NOT ALL OF OUR PLANS.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.727
- ONE GIANT HOT TUB...

03:46.760 --> 03:47.995
boys: COMING UP!

03:56.704 --> 03:59.807
- HEY, MR. BITTERS EVENTUALLY
FOUND ALL OF HIS POOL FURNITURE.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.843
- ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET
GUSTAVO TO TAKE THE DAY OFF,

04:02.876 --> 04:04.878
AND WE WRITE AND RECORD A SONG
AT THE STUDIO.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.282
- YEAH, ONE PROBLEM.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.318
HOW DO WE GET THE LONE WOLF
OUT OF THE STUDIO?

04:14.688 --> 04:15.956
- WHAT ARE YOU IDIOTS
SO HAPPY ABOUT?

04:17.458 --> 04:19.393
STOP.
IT'S CREEPING ME OUT.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.894
- WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OVER
ROCQUE RECORDS

04:20.928 --> 04:24.932
AND BEAT GUSTAVO AT WRITING
THE HIT SONG FOR OUR DELUXE CD.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.367
- HE'LL KILL YOU.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.368
- OH, NO, HE WON'T,

04:27.401 --> 04:28.636
BECAUSE HE'LL BE BUSY

04:28.669 --> 04:29.970
AT THE PALM WOODS'
NEW HEALTH SPA...

04:30.003 --> 04:31.672
- THAT YOU RUN.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.007
- I WANT 20%
OF THE SONG PUBLISHING.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.977
- WHAT IS THAT?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.646
- JUST SAY YES.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.481
all: YES.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.582
- MOVE OUT!
- WHOO!

04:48.722 --> 04:50.624
- HEY, CAN YOU GUYS HELP ME
WITH A PLAN?

04:53.461 --> 04:55.863
both: IT DOESN'T INVOLVE
A GIANT HOT TUB, DOES IT?

04:55.896 --> 04:58.031
- HEALTH SPA.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.368
- YOU ARE NOT WRITING THIS SONG!

05:00.401 --> 05:04.905
BECAUSE THE LONE WOLF
WILL HAVE HIS...

05:04.938 --> 05:08.075
MUSKRAT....

05:08.108 --> 05:10.911
LOVE SONG BY THE END OF THE DAY.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.581
- I'M LEARNING SO MANY THINGS
ABOUT SONGWRITING.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.484
- NOW, GET OUT,
BECAUSE DOGS STRESSING ME OUT

05:16.517 --> 05:19.420
IS NOT GOOD FOR SONGWRITING.

05:19.453 --> 05:23.424
- THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO RELAX
AT THE PALM WOODS' NEW SPA.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.426
- YEAH, WHY WOULD I WANT TO GO
TO A SPA?

05:25.459 --> 05:28.462
- UH, BECAUSE JAY-Z WROTE
AN ENTIRE ALBUM

05:28.496 --> 05:30.631
WHILE GETTING A SEAWEED MANGO
BODY SCRUB.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.801
- WELL, RELAXING
AND CLEARING YOUR MIND

05:33.834 --> 05:35.769
IS GOOD FOR SONGWRITING.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.439
- HERE'S YOUR HAT.
- AND YOUR COMPLIMENTARY COUPON.

05:38.472 --> 05:39.540
- WHOA!

05:39.573 --> 05:40.841
- HAVE A GREAT TIME.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.943
- REST AND RELAXATION.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.912
- OKAY, LET'S WRITE A SONG.

05:44.945 --> 05:45.979
both: ON IT!

05:46.013 --> 05:50.451
- TIME TO WRITE THE...

05:50.484 --> 05:51.952
- HATE BABY SONG.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.955
- WELL, DARTBOARD METHOD'S
NOT WORKING.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.157
WHAT ELSE DID GUSTAVO SAY
ABOUT SONGWRITING?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.993
- HE SAID, "STARE INTO THE EYES
OF THE SUN

06:00.027 --> 06:02.730
TO FIND THE KILLER HOOK."

06:04.197 --> 06:05.433
[shrieking horror music]

06:05.466 --> 06:10.504

[elevator music playing]

06:13.574 --> 06:14.608
[gong resounds]

06:14.642 --> 06:17.745
all: WELCOME
TO THE PALM WOODS SPA.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.147
- YEAH, THIS IS A SCAM.
I'M OUT.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.281
- IT'S NOT A SCAM.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.184
I STARTED THIS SPA SO I COULD
SAVE MONEY FOR COLLEGE,

06:24.217 --> 06:27.087
AND I COULD REALLY USE
A TOP CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENT

06:27.120 --> 06:29.823
FROM SOMEONE FAMOUS
AND WONDERFUL LIKE YOU.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.459
- KEEP TALKING.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.093
- I EVEN HIRED
THIS REAL-LIFE SPA LADY

06:33.126 --> 06:34.495
AND EVERYTHING.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.963
- HALLO!

06:35.996 --> 06:37.197
- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.499
- JA.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.500
- WHAT THE HECK;

06:39.533 --> 06:43.704
I DO NEED TO GET MY SONGWRITING
JUICES FLOWING.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.539
WHOA!
[yelling]

06:45.573 --> 06:50.978
[metronome ticking]

06:53.180 --> 06:54.682
- WELL, ONE THING'S FOR SURE:

06:54.715 --> 06:58.452
THIS METRONOME IS NOT HELPING!

06:58.486 --> 07:00.988
- LOOK, WE JUST GOT TO DIVE IN.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.057
WE GOTTA STOP THINKING ABOUT IT
AND JUST MAKE MUSIC.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.059
[together]
HE'S RIGHT.

07:08.562 --> 07:14.167
[four different tunes playing]

07:18.005 --> 07:19.573
[drumsticks clatter]

07:19.607 --> 07:22.543
- OKAY, SO GUSTAVO SAID CLEARING
YOUR HEAD AND RELAXING

07:22.576 --> 07:23.911
IS GOOD FOR SONGWRITING.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.112
- WHAT'S MORE RELAXING

07:25.145 --> 07:27.214
THAN A NICE, FRIENDLY GAME
OF FOOSBALL?

07:27.247 --> 07:29.216
- OH!

07:29.249 --> 07:31.118
* OH, OH, OH, OH

07:31.151 --> 07:32.185
* O-O-OH

07:32.219 --> 07:35.055
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
THAT'S NOT BAD.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.490
- YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

07:36.524 --> 07:37.424
- WELL, IT NEEDS MORE LYRICS,

07:37.457 --> 07:41.128
BUT AT LEAST THE "OH" SONG
HAS A MELODY.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.564
- "O" IS A LETTER, GENIUS,
NOT A SONG TITLE.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.733
- OH!
AND YOU GUYS CAN DO BETTER?

07:45.766 --> 07:46.934
- YEAH!

07:46.967 --> 07:47.935
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE,

07:47.968 --> 07:49.036
AND THE SONG WILL COME TO ME.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.707
- WE DON'T HAVE A MINUTE.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.676
WE HAVE TO WRITE THE SONG
BEFORE GUSTAVO GETS BACK.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.077
- THEN GET US MORE MINUTES!

07:58.145 --> 07:59.112
[phone rings]

07:59.146 --> 07:59.980
- PALM WOODS SPA,

08:00.013 --> 08:02.683
WHERE WE MAKE THE STARS
SHINE BRIGHTER.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.719
- KATIE, HAVE I TOLD YOU
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU TODAY?

08:05.753 --> 08:07.220
- HOW MUCH MORE TIME
DO YOU NEED?

08:07.254 --> 08:08.756
- ANOTHER HOUR.
WE'RE ON TO SOMETHING.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.824
THANKS, BYE!

08:10.858 --> 08:12.059
- ZERE.
ALL DONE.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.765

I AM REFRESHED.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.601
NOW BACK TO MY STUDIO
AND WRITE MY NEW HIT!

08:20.634 --> 08:21.735
- WAIT!

08:21.769 --> 08:23.704
YOU MUST STAY AND TRY

08:23.737 --> 08:28.542
OUR NEW DEEP-CONDITIONING,
SALTED WAXING THING

08:28.576 --> 08:30.611
AND STAY LONGER.

08:30.644 --> 08:34.314
- YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO.
LATERS.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.651
[suspenseful music crescendos]

08:37.685 --> 08:38.819
- IT GROWS HAIR!

08:38.852 --> 08:39.920
[record scratches]

08:39.953 --> 08:42.189
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.893
- UH, ZAT'S WHAT BOB THOUGHT
WHEN HE WAS COMPLETELY BALD.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.595
NOW LOOK AT HIM.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.598
[dance music]

08:50.631 --> 08:59.272
*

08:59.306 --> 09:01.008
- AH.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.712
SO I SAYS TO THE LADY, I SAYS,
"HONEY, IF THAT'S COUTURE,

09:04.745 --> 09:07.014
I AM THE QUEEN OF SHEBA."

09:07.047 --> 09:08.616
- WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

09:10.183 --> 09:12.085
[cow moos]

09:12.119 --> 09:14.688
both: FRENCH HERBS.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.789
- OOH.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.758
- LOOK, WE'RE RUNNING OUT
OF TIME.

09:17.791 --> 09:18.859
THE "OH" SONG IS COOL,

09:18.892 --> 09:20.594
SO WE'RE RECORDING
THE "OH" SONG.

09:20.628 --> 09:24.231
both: * OH, OH, OH, OH, OH

09:24.264 --> 09:25.899
- NOT FEELING THE "OH" SONG.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.668
- DO YOU HAVE A BETTER SONG?

09:27.701 --> 09:28.936
- YEAH.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.070
* YEAH, YEAH

09:30.103 --> 09:31.104
OOH, "YEAH, YEAH."

09:31.138 --> 09:33.841
* YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH *

09:33.874 --> 09:35.042
THAT WAS GOOD.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.978
- NO, OUR SONG IS WAY BETTER.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.346
- OF COURSE YOU'D SAY THAT,

09:39.379 --> 09:41.214
'CAUSE YOU ALWAYS SIDE
WITH KENDALL.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.984
- NO, HE DOESN'T.
- YEAH, HE DOES.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.853
- OKAY, THEN YOU PICK THE SONG.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.020
WHICH ONE IS BETTER, LOGAN,

09:47.054 --> 09:50.758
THE "OH" SONG OR "YEAH" SONG?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.259
- UH, YOU GUYS?

09:52.292 --> 09:54.361
I WOULD REALLY RATHER NOT GET
INTO THE MIDDLE OF THIS, SO--

09:54.394 --> 09:55.829
- BIG SURPRISE.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.898
LOGAN DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE
A DECISION.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.900
- HEY!
HE MAKES DECISIONS.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.134
- THEN DECIDE.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.004
- FINE.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.640
THE "YEAH" SONG
IS A HAPPY INTERJECTION

10:06.674 --> 10:09.242
WHICH PROMOTES
POSITIVE FEELINGS,

10:09.276 --> 10:11.378
WHEREAS "OH" CONNOTES
UNPLEASANT SURPRISES.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.248

10:15.282 --> 10:17.050

[boys yelling]

10:21.054 --> 10:23.256
- EVERYBODY, CHILL!

10:23.290 --> 10:25.158
REMEMBER WHAT KELLY SAID
ABOUT SONGWRITING:

10:25.192 --> 10:28.195
FIGHTING DOESN'T SOLVE ANYTHING.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.832
[boys yelling]

10:31.865 --> 10:32.966
- TAKE IT BACK!
TAKE IT BACK!

10:33.000 --> 10:34.334

10:34.367 --> 10:36.336
- TAKE IT BACK!
TAKE IT BACK!

10:36.369 --> 10:39.206
- THE "OH" SONG IS AWESOME!

10:39.239 --> 10:43.110
- WE WILL DEFEND THE "YEAH" SONG
TILL THE DEATH!

10:54.454 --> 10:56.156
- HELLOOO?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.461
both: HA!

11:01.494 --> 11:02.830
- NOT SO FAST.

11:02.863 --> 11:03.964
YOU JUST STAY
RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE:

11:03.997 --> 11:05.833
IN LOSERVILLE.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.001
- YEAH, AND WE'RE JUST GOING
TO RECORD THE "YEAH" SONG

11:08.035 --> 11:10.403
IN CAMP AWESOME.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.140
- I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD'VE PICKED
CAMP AWESOME.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.809
- WELL, IF YOU GUYS
GET STUDIO "A,"

11:15.843 --> 11:18.278
THEN WE GET STUDIO "B."

11:18.311 --> 11:20.914
- GOOD LUCK
GETTING THROUGH OUR HALLWAY.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.115
- YOUR HALLWAY?

11:22.149 --> 11:24.284
- HEY, THIS IS NO-MAN'S-LAND.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.287
THERE'S NO RULES
IN NO-MAN'S-LAND.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.722
- THEN GO AHEAD...
IF YOU DARE.

11:28.756 --> 11:31.124
[laughter]

11:31.158 --> 11:33.393
- OOH!

11:33.426 --> 11:37.130
- WE NEED A STUDIO
TO RECORD THE "OH" SONG.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.799
- LET'S MAKE A RUN FOR IT.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.200
ONE.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.501
TWO.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.049
I'M HIT!

11:56.083 --> 11:58.451
GO ON AND WRITE THE SONG
WITHOUT ME.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.388
- YOU'RE NOT HIT.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.756
IT'S IN YOUR ARMPIT.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.358
- HUH!
I'M BETTER.

12:05.392 --> 12:09.396
- OKAY, WE HAVE OUR OWN SPACE
TO WRITE AND RECORD OUR SONG,

GUSTAVO IS ALMOST DONE
WITH HIS HAIR TREATMENT,

12:15.803 --> 12:17.037
AND I DON'T THINK
HE'S GOING TO WANT TO STAY

12:17.070 --> 12:18.906
ONCE HE SEES THE RESULTS.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.373
- LOOK, WE JUST NEED
ANOTHER HOUR.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.143
AND DON'T FORGET, I TALKED MOM
OUT OF NAMING YOU "APPLE."

12:23.176 --> 12:24.277
- FINE!

12:57.377 --> 12:58.345

MORE LYRICS

13:31.178 --> 13:32.545
THAN "OH, OH, OH,"

13:32.579 --> 13:35.916
AND GUSTAVO SAID SILENCE ALSO
INSPIRES SONGWRITING.

- CAN YOU STOP THAT?

13:47.427 --> 13:48.528
- YOU MEAN BREATHING?

13:48.561 --> 13:50.130
- JUST FOR A FEW MINUTES.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.484
- THE "OH" SONG IS GONNA BE
SO MUCH BETTER

14:11.518 --> 14:12.485
THAN THE "YEAH" SONG.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.955
- YES!
- SING IT AGAIN.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.234
- YEAH,
BUT I'M DRAWING A BLANK.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.069

MY VERBAL SKILLS WORK BEST
WHEN I'M CHARMING THE LADIES.

- WHAT?

14:37.410 --> 14:41.281

14:54.361 --> 14:57.197
BUT THIS IS A LITTLE AWKWARD
FOR ME, OKAY?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.298
- WHO CARES?

14:58.331 --> 15:00.500
BECAUSE THE "YEAH" SONG
IS GONNA BE THE BONUS TRACK,

15:00.533 --> 15:04.037
AND GUSTAVO'S GONNA LOVE IT
AND US.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.538

WHOO!

OUR SHIATSU NECK ADJUSTMENT!

I GUESS WE DO HAVE
A SHIATSU NECK ADJUSTMENT.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.623
- ACTUALLY, IT'S KUNG FU,

15:23.656 --> 15:27.060
WHICH I LEARNED WHEN I TRAINED
FOR KUNG FU BABYSITTER.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.595
- OKAY, NOW OUR SPA
JUST NEEDS SOMETHING

15:28.628 --> 15:30.530
TO MAKE HIM STAY PUT
FOR A WHILE.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.200

- OKAY, GOT THE LYRICS.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.336
NOW WE JUST GOT TO CALL
THE BAND.

- UM, HE SAID
HE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

15:50.650 --> 15:54.487
- BUT HE WANTS THIS SONG
FINISHED BEFORE HE GETS BACK.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.657
- AND BEFORE HE LEFT, I THINK
HIS WORDS WERE, UM....

15:57.690 --> 15:58.691

16:18.445 --> 16:20.613
THE "OH" SONG IS GONNA BE
WAY BETTER.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.217
- OKAY, BUT HOW DO WE GET
THE BAND OUT OF CAMP AWESOME?

22:15.468 --> 22:16.936

22:19.439 --> 22:22.709
BUT ENDED
WITH A BIG-TIME COLLABORATION.

22:22.742 --> 22:25.678
