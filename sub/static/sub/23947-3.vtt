[music playing]

00:17.893 --> 00:19.895
[explosions]

00:25.108 --> 00:27.277
I asked who you were.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.612
[smooches]

00:33.325 --> 00:36.245
"One of the voices
is eternally angelic.

00:36.328 --> 00:39.289
It is about me.
Sharply expresses itself,

00:39.373 --> 00:41.875
those thousand questions
spreading their roots

00:41.959 --> 00:44.169
bring in the end
only drunkenness and madness.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.837
-Understanding...
-Is she with you, too?!

00:45.921 --> 00:47.381
...so gay, so easy.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.883
It is only wave, only flower,

00:49.967 --> 00:52.010
and that is your family!

00:52.094 --> 00:53.470
And then a voice,

00:53.553 --> 00:55.681
how angelic it is."

[woman vocalizing]

[wheels grinding]

01:42.728 --> 01:45.439
Hey, Eric, any activity in the--

01:45.522 --> 01:47.608
Huh? What're you-- Hey!

01:47.691 --> 01:50.944
What the hell are you doing?!
Quit shoving! That hurts!

01:53.739 --> 01:55.907
Have you lost it?!

01:55.991 --> 01:57.576
Hang on a second, Genie!

01:57.659 --> 01:59.745
Did you ever
get your license renewed?!

01:59.828 --> 02:01.872
Slow down, would you?!

02:01.955 --> 02:04.041
Where the heck
you taking me?! Yaah!

02:11.882 --> 02:14.801
[man] We don't have any
other choice. We have to try.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.803
[man #2]
What are you talking about?

02:16.887 --> 02:18.221
That plan would never work.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.848
[woman] Then what
do you suggest?

02:21.350 --> 02:23.185
[Mario]
Try and remain calm, everyone!

02:23.268 --> 02:25.187
I know all of you are worried.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.730
The Royal Police's Hazmat Team

02:26.813 --> 02:28.857
is dealing with the situation
as we speak,

02:28.940 --> 02:30.859
Bear with us just a bit longer.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.737
[man #3] You've been singing
the same song all night!

02:33.820 --> 02:36.031
[man #4] Tell the truth!
What's going on?!

02:36.114 --> 02:38.283
[crowd murmuring]

02:38.367 --> 02:39.826
What now?

02:39.910 --> 02:41.536
I honestly don't know.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.581
There's not a lot we can do
at a time like this.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.459
We're going to make it out
in one piece, aren't we?

02:47.542 --> 02:49.753
[Red laughs]

02:49.836 --> 02:51.713
Ugly. How ugly.

02:51.797 --> 02:55.467
Death is knocking at your door,
and this is the way you behave?

02:55.550 --> 02:58.303
I'm not like you people.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.013
I'm someone special!

03:00.097 --> 03:02.224
I'm the one
who'll go down in history

03:02.307 --> 03:04.518
as the very embodiment
of terror,

03:04.601 --> 03:07.312
so I'll embrace death
with my head held high!

03:07.396 --> 03:09.898
[wild laughter]

03:11.733 --> 03:15.654
No finesse. It's like he
just slapped his code together.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.447
Tech skills, one.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.991
Specs are
an uninspired plagiarism.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.452
Originality, zero.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.580
I give offense
and defense a one.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.707
Overall grade, D.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.627
[sighs] A third-rate hack
of a malware writer, huh?

03:30.710 --> 03:32.629
Disappointing, but that means...

03:34.047 --> 03:36.633
2,700 seconds left.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.093
I could kick his ass

03:38.176 --> 03:40.095
three times over
with time to spare.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.888
[wheels grinding]

04:13.462 --> 04:16.423
"It is about me.
Sharply expresses itself

04:16.505 --> 04:20.802
and sings at this moment
like a sister to breath.

04:20.886 --> 04:24.181
With a German tone,
but ardent and full.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.267
The world is vicious.
You can't deny it.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.270
If that surprises you."

04:45.911 --> 04:47.621
The king has landed.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.874
I'll have my audience
in front of his father's grave.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.388
[gasps]

05:12.979 --> 05:13.980
Hmm.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.946
[alarm beeping]

05:23.990 --> 05:25.659
[gasping]

05:29.079 --> 05:30.205
I'm in deep shit.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.125
Are you frickin' kidding me?!

05:34.209 --> 05:36.253
-Got it. I take it...
-[Blue muttering]

05:36.336 --> 05:39.047
the black swan has taken flight
as planned, then.

05:39.130 --> 05:42.467
I suppose I'll use the clowns
to make my exit from here.

05:42.551 --> 05:43.552
[glove creaks]

05:43.635 --> 05:46.680
Crap. There's no way
I can keep up with this guy.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.974
Damn it, I'm getting
my ass kicked here.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.226
Can we please
be done with this?!

05:51.309 --> 05:53.478
Whoever this is,
he's the real deal!

05:53.562 --> 05:54.813
We gotta jump ship.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.481
Hey, are you listening to--

05:56.565 --> 05:57.941
[gags]

05:59.276 --> 06:01.486
Being oblivious to danger

06:01.570 --> 06:04.406
is proof one has deteriorated
as a living thing.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.491
Bye-bye.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.703
-[grunting]
-[sawing]

06:14.040 --> 06:15.166
[gasps]

06:15.250 --> 06:16.960
It stopped.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.841
The counterattack attempts
have stopped.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.344
Did he realize
he was going to lose?

06:26.428 --> 06:30.140
No way. He isn't
that fast on the uptake.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.976
Maybe it's a trap
to lure us into the building,

06:33.059 --> 06:35.812
<i>or it could be they're using
<i>some kind of tactic</i></i>

06:35.895 --> 06:39.357
<i>to confuse us and slow us down,
<i>or maybe they found themselves</i></i>

06:39.441 --> 06:41.526
<i>in a situation
<i>they didn't plan for.</i></i>

06:43.028 --> 06:44.946
Sink or swim time.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.448
Whatever's happening out there,

06:46.531 --> 06:48.074
it doesn't leave us
many options.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.910
We'll have to take the bait,
play it by ear.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.330
Jean, put me through
to the hazmat team.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.623
On it.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.635
[computer whirring]

07:13.934 --> 07:15.685
-It's open.
-We're saved.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.647
-[officer] They're coming out!
-[officer #2] Call it in!

07:20.649 --> 07:24.069
[cell phone ringing]

07:24.152 --> 07:25.820
Eric, it's Kaela.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.989
You can just put her on speaker.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.786
-[typing over phone]
<i>-Eric?</i>

07:32.869 --> 07:35.997
Yes, Kaela, it's me.
You're on speaker.

07:36.081 --> 07:39.042
I'm at headquarters
with Jean, Abbot, and Brody.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.336
I'd prefer
to take the call like this.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.798
<i>I got the building's systems
<i>back online.</i></i>

07:44.881 --> 07:48.385
That's excellent. Now I need you
to locate the poison gas.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.262
<i>I'm already on it, but there's
<i>something bugging me.</i></i>

07:51.346 --> 07:52.764
Hmm? What is it?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.724
While I was attacking
the system,

07:54.808 --> 07:57.018
the criminals made
several desperate attempts

07:57.102 --> 07:59.312
to stop me
from getting in their way,

07:59.396 --> 08:01.481
but now they've gone dark.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.274
It's gone dark?

08:03.358 --> 08:04.734
Hmm.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.444
Could be a trap.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.631
-[crowd screaming]
-[man] No! It's the gas!

08:26.715 --> 08:28.216
Run!

08:29.342 --> 08:30.343
[gasps]

08:30.427 --> 08:32.595
[groans]

08:34.139 --> 08:36.558
[gasping]

08:36.640 --> 08:38.559
[Eric] Mario, report!

08:39.644 --> 08:41.938
Somebody talk to me!

08:42.022 --> 08:45.275
Brandon, Lily, respond, damn it!

08:48.737 --> 08:50.363
I can't believe this.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.656
Shit.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.283
[typing over phone]

08:53.366 --> 08:55.952
Kaela, if you manipulate
the building's HVAC system

08:56.036 --> 08:57.746
<i>and direct the flow of air,</i>

08:57.829 --> 08:59.748
<i>you should
<i>be able to divert gas</i></i>

08:59.831 --> 09:02.250
<i>into empty parts
<i>of the building! Get on it!</i></i>

09:02.333 --> 09:06.212
There's a risk airtight rooms
will become starved of oxygen.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.715
<i>Plus if anyone's still
<i>in those rooms, they'll--</i></i>

09:08.798 --> 09:11.217
I'll take responsibility!
Worry about the gas!

09:11.301 --> 09:13.303
Hurry! There's no time to waste!

09:13.386 --> 09:14.387
Roger that.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.308
[fan whirring]

09:18.391 --> 09:20.268

09:44.334 --> 09:46.336
[Eric] <i>Boris,
<i>what's your current location?</i></i>

09:46.419 --> 09:47.754
<i>Is Keith with you?!</i>

09:49.005 --> 09:50.965
Yeah, he's here!

09:51.049 --> 09:52.884
We're northbound on Route 8!

09:52.967 --> 09:55.637
<i>Route 8?
<i>Why are you out there?</i></i>

09:55.720 --> 09:58.264
No idea! Take it up with Keith!

09:58.348 --> 10:00.266
[screaming]

10:07.273 --> 10:09.484
<i>Keith, we have
<i>an emergency on our hands!</i></i>

10:09.567 --> 10:11.444
<i>-Get back here immediately!
-Hmm?</i>

10:11.528 --> 10:14.531
<i>The gas was released
<i>throughout the tower.</i></i>

10:14.614 --> 10:16.533
What?! Run that by me again!

10:16.616 --> 10:19.119
<i>We can't get ahold
<i>of any of our people</i></i>

10:19.202 --> 10:20.578
<i>who were inside the building!</i>

10:20.662 --> 10:22.872
-Genie, we have to head back!
-[Eric continuing]

10:22.956 --> 10:24.040
-Don't worry.
-[yelps]

10:24.124 --> 10:25.208
[car horn honking]

10:25.291 --> 10:27.210
[Keith] Sorry, Eric.
Deal with it yourself.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.212
What are you talking about,
you idiot?!

10:29.295 --> 10:31.214
Lily and the kids are in there.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.924
[Keith] If <i>it's been released.</i>

10:33.007 --> 10:35.760
-[gasps]
-If it has been released,

10:35.844 --> 10:37.512
then the gas is fake,

10:37.595 --> 10:40.098
a dispersal meant
to throw the scene into chaos.

10:40.181 --> 10:44.477
<i>They're trying to buy time and
<i>probably cover their escape.</i></i>

10:44.561 --> 10:45.562
Where's your proof?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.272
[Keith] Didn't you see it?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.232
The criminal
is a myopic thinker,

10:49.315 --> 10:50.775
an immature narcissist.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.403
He's your basic
dumb, self-absorbed kid

10:53.486 --> 10:55.488
obsessed with
superficial aesthetics.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.532
That's harsh, even for you.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.410
When a narcissist is writing
his autobiography,

11:00.493 --> 11:03.037
his death is
a critical component.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.998
<i>Slowly dying in agony</i>

11:05.081 --> 11:08.209
<i>as his skin blisters
<i>from a modified corrosive gas,</i></i>

11:08.293 --> 11:11.004
you think he'd be okay
going out like that?

11:11.087 --> 11:12.797
Look through
the old profiles again.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.966
Nothing's there. Doesn't happen.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.594
[Eric] <i>You might be right.</i>

11:17.677 --> 11:19.888
<i>Everything you've said
<i>is still just a theory.</i></i>

11:19.971 --> 11:23.558
<i>The fact of the matter is
<i>we can't contact anyone inside.</i></i>

11:23.641 --> 11:26.644
It's a knockout gas, Eric.
Come on.

11:26.728 --> 11:31.024
<i>This incident and the IFV theft
<i>have the same structure.</i></i>

11:31.107 --> 11:34.485
<i>A sophisticated mind is working
<i>toward another objective</i></i>

11:34.569 --> 11:36.779
<i>under the cover of this chaos.</i>

11:38.281 --> 11:41.075
In other words, some group
is leeching off of crimes

11:41.159 --> 11:43.661
to carry out their own
carefully planned ones.

11:43.745 --> 11:47.040
Come to think of it, they might
even be manipulating crimes

11:47.123 --> 11:49.167
that seem
like random occurrences.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.879
A cycle of madness
is getting ready to break out.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.840
We won't find our answers
on the surface,

11:55.924 --> 11:57.717
<i>but behind the scenes.</i>

11:57.800 --> 11:59.177
SOMEONE IS COMMITTING
MEANINGLESS CRIMES

11:59.260 --> 12:01.471
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE
OF LURING OUT B.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.808
You're late.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.811
Kamui wouldn't leave
until he made his stupid trash.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.105
But the boys
were so excited about it,

12:11.189 --> 12:14.525
as they were able to bring
their lamentable lives to an end

12:14.609 --> 12:16.277
as part
of my magnificent collection.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.405
That means they were pathetic
to the very end, weren't they?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.032
[laughs]

12:21.115 --> 12:24.202
Kamui, you haven't forgotten
about our objective, I trust?

12:24.285 --> 12:27.538
Of course not.
That was just playtime.

12:27.622 --> 12:30.041
The objective
was accomplished just fine.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.880
And yet I don't see him
here with us.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.716
You've selective hearing
regarding my orders,

12:38.800 --> 12:40.885
a bad habit.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.428
Yeah, yeah.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.889
Hey, Minatsuki,
do we really have to lug

12:44.973 --> 12:47.475
the black-winged king
all the way back with us?

12:47.558 --> 12:50.728
Yes. Those are our orders.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.314
And do we have
to bring him back alive?

12:59.278 --> 13:01.864
Yes. That's all we want.

13:14.043 --> 13:18.214
I welcome you to Divine Days.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.383
A few days every October,

13:20.466 --> 13:23.219
Lake Lenan becomes
a gateway to the kingdom of God.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.931
Souls dance with joy
in the dark.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.349
[splashing]

13:30.893 --> 13:32.854
[singer vocalizing]

13:33.855 --> 13:35.982
Isn't it beautiful,

13:36.065 --> 13:38.109
countless lights
in the darkness?

13:39.444 --> 13:41.863
I absolutely love this place.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.449
Just one little light
can be enough

13:44.532 --> 13:48.119
to keep you from fearing
the dark or losing your way.

13:48.202 --> 13:51.706
Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

13:51.789 --> 13:53.624
Light represents hope.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.085
You can save your nonsense.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.879
Tell me where she is!

13:57.962 --> 14:01.174
If you don't start talking
right now, I'll kill you!

14:01.257 --> 14:03.509
My, you're so easy to read.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.261
Is she...

14:05.344 --> 14:06.512
your light?

14:06.596 --> 14:09.474
Are even your cherished
memories of her vague?

14:09.557 --> 14:10.933
Let me guess.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.519
You don't know much
about yourself either, do you?

14:13.603 --> 14:17.857
That's why I can hear your
desperate shouting so clearly.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.693
"Look at me! I'm right here!

14:20.777 --> 14:23.613
You see?! I'm alive! I'm alive!

14:23.696 --> 14:25.907
Somebody find me!"

14:27.742 --> 14:29.744
[laughing]

14:36.125 --> 14:37.794
I hate to tell you this,

14:37.877 --> 14:41.339
but the only things here are us
and the spirits of the dead.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.800
Out of all of us,
I'm the only one

14:43.883 --> 14:46.719
who's actually spent time
with you, however briefly.

14:46.803 --> 14:51.182
There was even a time
I lived only for you.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.643
We watched
these very lights together.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.771
That's the reason why I
lured you all the way here.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.565
-I wanted to make you remember.
-[gasps]

15:11.119 --> 15:14.747
Oh, dear. There go all my hopes.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.499
That's depressing.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.875
Koku...

15:19.127 --> 15:20.795
I've been thinking lately

15:20.878 --> 15:24.298
about the identity of the person
who locked away your memories.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.349
[chuckles]

15:33.433 --> 15:36.936
I've figured it out at last.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.857
Tell me where she is.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.737
The one who locked away
all of those memories

15:46.821 --> 15:48.698
was none other than...

15:48.781 --> 15:50.491
you, yourself.

15:51.576 --> 15:54.078
I bet you wanted
to forget it all...

15:55.288 --> 15:57.915
everything that happened
that day...

15:58.916 --> 16:00.460
everything.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.920
However...

16:05.506 --> 16:09.218
if you think you can forget me,
you're dead wrong.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.428
[slurps]

16:10.511 --> 16:12.221
I won't let you,

16:12.305 --> 16:15.850
and I'll never forgive you
for not choosing me!

16:19.479 --> 16:21.230
[Keith] Where the heck is this?

16:21.314 --> 16:23.357
-How should I know?
-Hmph.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.278
So do you mind filling me in?

16:27.361 --> 16:30.490
What in the world
are you chasing after, Keith?

16:31.616 --> 16:32.783
I'm not sure.

16:32.867 --> 16:33.951
Huh?

16:34.035 --> 16:37.330
It's just something
I need to chase down.

16:37.413 --> 16:41.417
Yes, but what are
you chasing down?

16:41.501 --> 16:44.128
Don't know. I wish I knew.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.560
[shudders]

17:50.695 --> 17:53.698
Do yourself a favor,
and cut off my left leg.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.449
It'll be useful to you someday.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.706
Touch Canopus.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.375
Do that, and...

18:06.502 --> 18:07.878
[Koku] Canopus?

18:14.135 --> 18:15.428
[woman groans]

18:18.347 --> 18:20.141
Can you tell me your name?

18:20.224 --> 18:24.020
Zeppole... di San Giuseppe.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.189
Do you know
where you are right now, miss?

18:27.273 --> 18:28.733
I'm...

18:29.609 --> 18:31.902
[gasps, yells]

18:31.986 --> 18:33.446
[overlapping chatter]

18:33.529 --> 18:34.822
[Lily gasping]

18:38.659 --> 18:40.578
Careful not
to sit up so quickly.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.787
Are you feeling queasy?

18:41.871 --> 18:43.539
Any discomfort?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.499
We're alive?

18:45.583 --> 18:47.877
I remember seeing gas
flood into the room,

18:47.960 --> 18:49.086
but nothing after that.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.464
They say it was
just knockout gas.

18:51.547 --> 18:55.635
But one thing's for sure.
They got us good this time.

18:55.718 --> 18:58.220
[Lily] So you're saying
our whack-job of a perp

18:58.304 --> 18:59.680
was bluffing the entire time?

18:59.764 --> 19:03.893
Well, no. There's apparently
evidence to the contrary.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.354
What does that mean?

19:06.437 --> 19:08.648
It means they did find
the poison gas.

19:08.731 --> 19:11.525
They just didn't use it
for some reason.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.611
-But, uh...
-Hmm?

19:14.737 --> 19:18.115
[Mario] The way they found it
wasn't exactly normal.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.496
[gags]

19:36.175 --> 19:37.843
Looks like we just missed 'em.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.943
[distant sirens]

19:54.026 --> 19:55.945
[Brandon] In addition
to the criminals' skins,

19:56.028 --> 19:57.822
they've also found
their remains.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.865
-[Lily] Where?
-Uh...

19:59.949 --> 20:03.077
I think you're better off
not knowing. If I told you,

20:03.160 --> 20:05.913
it'd probably make you lose
your appetite for a while.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.292
See, this ominous feeling
has been nagging at me.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.377
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

20:11.460 --> 20:13.003
[overlapping chatter]

20:13.087 --> 20:16.590
[Lily] <i>Don't these latest cases
<i>seem a bit strange to you?</i></i>

20:16.674 --> 20:18.801
<i>I mean, as far as I know,</i>

20:18.884 --> 20:21.762
we didn't get any answers
in this case, either, right?

20:21.846 --> 20:25.558
I feel like something strange
is going on in this city.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.977
-[distant sirens]
-You get all serious for once,

20:28.060 --> 20:31.272
and that's what you choose
to talk about?

20:31.355 --> 20:33.274
But you should listen
to your gut.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.483
I think it's right.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.360
I'm positive it is!

20:36.444 --> 20:40.448
Though when it comes to me,
"gut" has another meaning.

20:40.531 --> 20:43.659
You're right,
but we've got trouble coming.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.078
We have to do something.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.621
[Mario]
"I shall faithfully uphold

20:47.705 --> 20:49.832
the constitution
of the Kingdom of Cremona

20:49.915 --> 20:52.626
and comply with all orders
decreed by our king.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.628
I shall place them
before my duties

20:54.712 --> 20:57.757
as an officer of the law
and demand they be obeyed."

20:58.799 --> 21:01.927
"And with favor toward none
and with fear toward nothing,

21:02.011 --> 21:03.596
without malice or ill will,

21:03.679 --> 21:05.139
obeying only
my inner conscience..."

21:06.474 --> 21:07.933
"...to safeguard the kingdom,

21:08.017 --> 21:11.061
as well as the freedom and
rights of all her citizens,

21:11.145 --> 21:13.481
I solemnly swear
to carry out my duties

21:13.564 --> 21:15.399
as an officer of the law!"

21:15.483 --> 21:18.861
<i>-♪ Someday I'll be gone... ♪
-The day we took that oath,</i>

21:18.944 --> 21:22.615
the three of us became cops,
and damn good ones.

21:22.698 --> 21:26.619
We just have to keep
solving cases one after another.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.622
Honestly, that's all we can do.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.291
But, as small as they are,

21:32.374 --> 21:33.834
as those victories add up,

21:33.918 --> 21:35.628
they'll eventually
grow into a clue

21:35.711 --> 21:38.631
that will hopefully lead us
right to a breakthrough,

21:38.714 --> 21:41.217
'cause that's what I think.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.637
And having said all of that,
I still have no earthly idea

21:44.720 --> 21:47.056
when that breakthrough
is gonna happen for us.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.433
You're right.

21:49.517 --> 21:52.102
Therefore, thinking
about all that other stuff

21:52.186 --> 21:55.397
is a waste of time, right?

21:57.983 --> 21:59.401
Yeah, I get it.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.738
From now on,
I won't think anymore!
