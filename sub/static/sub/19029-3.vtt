00:03.025 --> 00:05.474
<i>Nothing in my life
could compare to this.</i>

00:05.730 --> 00:06.724
I'm a dad.

00:08.109 --> 00:11.445
- That's not your kid.
- I know but he reminds me of Sam.

00:12.023 --> 00:13.003
That's a girl!

00:13.004 --> 00:16.219
Stop ruining it! Why do you have to ruin
things? I'm-I'm having a moment here!

00:16.347 --> 00:17.504
<i>Let's go.</i>

00:17.579 --> 00:19.381
It must suck that Sam and Kim moved.

00:19.584 --> 00:22.423
What can I do? You know, she
took a job in another hospital.

00:22.557 --> 00:25.764
But they only moved like 40 minutes
away, I'm going to see Sam all the time.

00:25.765 --> 00:27.596
Matter of fact: I'm going there tonight.

00:29.625 --> 00:34.003
<i>The new patient's scale had all the
female staffers obsessing about one thing.</i>

00:34.004 --> 00:36.728
- I need to loose two pounds.
- Ah, since Keith and I broke up,

00:36.729 --> 00:39.394
I've been eating and sleeping very
well so... I'm down to dress size.

00:40.025 --> 00:42.759
- You look like you've been sick.
- Turk that's so sweet!

00:43.308 --> 00:44.862
Come on baby, let's go
seein' how much you weigh.

00:47.573 --> 00:49.976
<i>We all sensed what would
happen if Turk didn't let go.</i>

00:50.764 --> 00:51.590
Girls?

00:55.502 --> 00:58.814
Oh no! JD! Heeeelp!

01:02.267 --> 01:03.844
210 pounds!

01:04.506 --> 01:05.324
Good.

01:06.571 --> 01:07.696
*Tubbo*

01:07.697 --> 01:08.696
What's is saying.?

01:13.201 --> 01:13.981
Problem, lady?

01:17.361 --> 01:18.915
*Muscles wanted*

01:18.916 --> 01:21.912
Damn you, Carla and
your giant rubber stamps!

01:25.236 --> 01:27.361
- Let it go, Turk! Let it go!
- Sorry...

01:32.565 --> 01:37.251
Hey! If you're gonna drive that gas
guzzler, the least you can do is car pool.

01:37.596 --> 01:39.609
Hey! I don't see you
bring anybody to work.

01:40.075 --> 01:42.883
Hey! I just drove my
mum off at the mall.

01:43.635 --> 01:46.135
She... She sits on the seat and...

01:46.384 --> 01:50.349
then holds on by tucking her
hands inside my bike shorts.

01:50.686 --> 01:53.840
- That's disgusting.
- Yeah. Doesn't feel right.

01:55.492 --> 01:58.780
- Hey! It's your engine still running?
- Yeah.

01:58.976 --> 02:01.294
I let it run all day so I can
leave the air conditioner on,

02:01.295 --> 02:03.162
uhm, hey, it's nice and
cool when I drive home.

02:03.685 --> 02:05.712
I got a gas ups and downs over
lunch but it's worth it.

02:06.568 --> 02:09.422
You have to see "An inconvenient truth".

02:10.180 --> 02:11.622
It would change your life.

02:14.461 --> 02:16.849
- They're ruining the planet.
- Yeah.

02:18.974 --> 02:19.817
Don't go!

02:22.503 --> 02:25.477
- You know what really sucks?
- Being trapped in an elevator with you

02:25.478 --> 02:27.527
while you whine about your stupid life?

02:27.957 --> 02:29.767
You know what? It's actually okay.

02:30.382 --> 02:31.937
All I need to is white noise.

02:35.519 --> 02:38.875
Yeah, I've got this new kid but it's
come at the crappiest time of my life.

02:40.645 --> 02:43.260
Plus, I'm making the fully
mad driver on a scooter.

02:43.456 --> 02:46.896
And if I ever wanna bring Sam here, I can't,
because his stupid flopsy baby neck

02:46.897 --> 02:48.247
isn't strong enough to wear a helmet.

02:49.126 --> 02:49.929
- Hi, later.
- Hi, later.

02:50.560 --> 02:54.142
Anyway, wonder what the cherry on top
on the crap Sunday that is my life?

02:54.450 --> 02:57.344
Tomorrow, my loser brother's
coming here. Not happy.

02:58.617 --> 02:59.961
Dude, you need some perspective.

03:00.689 --> 03:04.339
This guy came here for a simple
spinal fusion. He got septic...

03:05.052 --> 03:06.396
and there was nothing we could do.

03:08.228 --> 03:10.924
Do you still want to complain because
you're brother's coming in today?

03:11.345 --> 03:12.742
Ah... Tomorrow.

03:13.447 --> 03:14.439
Dan's coming tomorrow.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.557
No, actually he's coming in today.

03:18.397 --> 03:20.147
He gave me a call, asked me if I'd help him

03:20.148 --> 03:22.219
with some embarassing prank
he wanted to pull on you.

03:22.985 --> 03:25.111
Thanks for the warning,
Turk. You're a good friend.

03:25.112 --> 03:26.273
I am!

03:28.369 --> 03:29.300
Why are they all here?

03:30.757 --> 03:33.392
- Zombie! Ah!
- AH AH AH AH AH!

03:56.326 --> 03:58.939
- Christopher, thanks again for your help.
- Hey man, if it involves making

03:58.940 --> 04:01.710
JD scream like a little
girl, I am there for you.

04:01.711 --> 04:04.241
AAAAAAH! I'm a monster!

04:05.450 --> 04:06.561
It takes more planning than that.

04:07.140 --> 04:08.822
It must be embarassing for you.

04:09.310 --> 04:10.328
Damn it!

04:11.540 --> 04:14.882
Three officians in six months
for stress related issues?

04:15.475 --> 04:17.345
Really? Well, here's
what I want you to do.

04:17.863 --> 04:18.899
Stop...

04:19.651 --> 04:22.069
getting... worked up...

04:22.759 --> 04:25.004
over... Again... over...

04:25.379 --> 04:27.377
small things.

04:27.511 --> 04:31.086
They're everywhere. This stuff that's
making you goofy, it's all over. Stop that.

04:31.506 --> 04:32.287
Get him out of here.

04:33.413 --> 04:34.389
Dear God.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.327
Here's your coffee, Dr. Cox.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.790
You want me to grab then,

04:38.873 --> 04:41.966
even know I suspect the reason
that you're holding the hand

04:41.967 --> 04:44.288
was because the mug
itself is scolding hot.

04:44.505 --> 04:49.169
Now, I sent you out to get me
some jaw, not to give me a burn.

04:49.822 --> 04:50.806
Put the coffee down.

04:51.294 --> 04:54.463
Get out. Get out. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

04:55.305 --> 04:56.010
Wow!

04:56.822 --> 04:59.067
Yes, you. Questions? Comments?

04:59.428 --> 05:01.546
You do realize that you just
told the patient to reduce stress

05:01.547 --> 05:03.868
and then yelled at an
intern over... coffee?

05:04.227 --> 05:07.538
You are going to be the huge help when
it comes down to write my memories.

05:07.936 --> 05:09.828
I'm so sick of all the
hypocrites around here!

05:10.527 --> 05:13.365
Two words, sweetie: Sun screen.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.450
You know your smoking is killing you?

05:19.823 --> 05:21.160
God, that's delicious!

05:23.218 --> 05:25.876
A patient shouldn't have to take
advice if we can't follow ourselves.

05:29.128 --> 05:30.495
Woman's logic is flawless.

05:31.734 --> 05:33.581
Okay, people, time to save the planet!

05:34.017 --> 05:37.216
- But where to begin?
- My first step was going with

05:37.217 --> 05:39.776
all hemp underwear. It's awesome!

05:40.047 --> 05:44.447
Except when the hemp oil sips into
your bloodstream, then it's awesomer!

05:45.575 --> 05:46.446
Sir.

05:46.948 --> 05:49.509
Make it snappy jumpsuit,
I'm already late for my nap.

05:49.794 --> 05:54.570
and Ted, so help me, I had better not find
your head indentation on my pillow again.

05:56.591 --> 05:58.674
This hospital is dropping
the ball environmentally

05:58.675 --> 06:01.637
and I would like to volunteer
my services as an environmental officer.

06:02.068 --> 06:03.697
- Will it cost me anything?
- No.

06:04.073 --> 06:06.273
- Knock yourself up, hippie.
- Groovy.

06:07.227 --> 06:08.664
Hey, brother...

06:10.306 --> 06:13.081
I had to take it 'cause of all the head sweat.

06:15.185 --> 06:17.327
Thanks for buy me a lunch today.
I'm all cash light.

06:17.709 --> 06:19.407
<i>Having Dan here wasn't all bad.</i>

06:20.331 --> 06:22.358
So, Dan, you still living with your mom?

06:22.359 --> 06:25.039
Carla, Dan doesn't live with our mom,

06:25.062 --> 06:27.660
He lives in the apartment
that happens to be in mom's attic.

06:27.908 --> 06:30.321
<i>Yep! Nothing makes my life seem less crappy</i>

06:30.322 --> 06:32.407
<i>that hangin' out with my loser bro.</i>

06:32.759 --> 06:37.107
I mean, sure, there's lots of bats up there
but it's because there's no air conditioning.

06:37.550 --> 06:39.728
- Bats like Hit?
- Mustee Hit, yes.

06:40.034 --> 06:42.447
- Good question, Turk.
- Thanks.

06:42.912 --> 06:44.838
How come you don't point out
when I ask good questions?

06:44.949 --> 06:46.609
Because I don't love you like he does.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.871
Told you...

06:47.996 --> 06:49.670
Actually, JD, I just bought my own house.

06:49.918 --> 06:52.786
How could you afford to do that
on a part-time bartender salary?

06:53.147 --> 06:54.333
I flip houses for living now.

06:55.504 --> 06:57.246
Turns out I'm really good
at this real estate stuff.

06:57.330 --> 06:59.810
Pry 'cause it envolved another
small money lying at double speed.

07:01.294 --> 07:03.906
Well, if you're doing so well, how come
you made me buy all your lunch?

07:04.200 --> 07:05.754
Good question, JD!

07:07.867 --> 07:10.239
I wasn't aware we needed a reason
for trying to score a free meal.

07:10.369 --> 07:13.090
Can you... can I t...
I just... I'm just...

07:13.956 --> 07:16.875
- You have your own sandwich.
- Now I have yours.

07:18.211 --> 07:19.788
- Mayo?
- Why, you don't like mayo?

07:21.019 --> 07:21.988
Oh, I guess not.

07:24.276 --> 07:27.695
So, Robin, I see here
that you passed out at work.

07:27.928 --> 07:30.090
Yeah! I saw a ghost!

07:30.346 --> 07:32.508
- Really? No way.
- No.

07:32.632 --> 07:34.528
But I have to mope with
something interesting, right?

07:34.669 --> 07:36.020
I mean, it was so embarassing.

07:36.263 --> 07:38.185
Uh, tell people that was your mother's ghost.

07:38.756 --> 07:42.067
- I can't. My mom is still alive.
- Ahh, bummer.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.021
Yeah.

07:43.824 --> 07:45.679
Anywho, we run some tests,

07:45.767 --> 07:47.999
Hopefully it will be something
exotic. Wait, maybe not fatal.

07:48.232 --> 07:49.255
Right.

07:52.067 --> 07:53.041
Sip.

07:58.820 --> 08:02.321
That is hot. Add some half
and half and come back. Go.

08:09.700 --> 08:12.376
Sorry, this spaces are now for carpool only.

08:12.655 --> 08:14.600
What if someone who's
not a carpool parks here?

08:14.787 --> 08:17.881
Obviously, as environmental officer,
I don't have any real power,

08:17.926 --> 08:20.359
but I can give you this citation,

08:20.749 --> 08:22.506
just as a symbolic gesture.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.888
You'll notice on the back, I made
a list of possible concequences

08:25.911 --> 08:28.064
for violating the hospital's new green policy.

08:28.266 --> 08:32.246
If you leave a light on, I'll make you lick
a battery, or eat a light bulb, your choice.

08:32.602 --> 08:33.466
Of course.

08:33.688 --> 08:36.166
And as for parking in a
carpool only landing, well,

08:36.167 --> 08:40.457
I can't really damage your car, but
I might just throw wasp hive in there.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.407
Hey guys.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.743
Many mess with the locks, he can't get out.

08:59.771 --> 09:00.600
Bam!

09:00.713 --> 09:03.837
- I'm gonna go with "aw".
- Member! Give a hoots, don't litter.

09:04.752 --> 09:05.818
That was outstanding.

09:06.442 --> 09:07.658
Where's your "can", Dan?

09:07.996 --> 09:09.851
You're so cranky. I'm gonna cheer you up.

09:10.042 --> 09:13.260
'Cause last time I went seeing you, JD,
you laid some hard truth on me

09:13.261 --> 09:14.852
that really helped me to turn
my life around, so now,

09:15.122 --> 09:16.406
I got you a little something
to say thank you.

09:18.426 --> 09:20.093
A new car!

09:20.544 --> 09:21.422
<i>Da hell?</i>

09:24.780 --> 09:26.842
So, your tests came back.

09:27.041 --> 09:30.194
Your prealbumine is low,
you've a protein deficiency,

09:30.344 --> 09:32.537
Robin, you're malnutrished.

09:33.251 --> 09:35.564
I eat.I mean, I'm not anorexic.

09:35.924 --> 09:39.397
I read your case history, you're a
vegetarian who runs every single morning,

09:39.486 --> 09:41.676
eats mostly salad,
have got a stressful job...

09:42.525 --> 09:45.318
Robin, you are 5.9"
and you weigh 119 pounds.

09:45.829 --> 09:47.222
You need to gain some weight.

09:47.758 --> 09:48.554
Hi there.

09:49.241 --> 09:51.296
I'm gonna go head and borrow
your doctor for a quick second.

09:52.301 --> 09:55.305
What the frick? You are ruining
all my shirt! Put me down!

09:55.797 --> 09:59.225
What are you doing? Because I gotta be honest
with you, this seems widely inappropriate.

09:59.406 --> 10:02.982
Well, I checked your malnutred
patient's chart back there and...

10:03.348 --> 10:07.057
and something occurred to me:
you are... you are 5.9" also, aren't you?

10:10.283 --> 10:12.088
Nooo! Put me down!

10:12.583 --> 10:13.715
Freak the hell!

10:13.890 --> 10:16.030
Don't you get for me the fricking scale!?

10:16.661 --> 10:17.540
Tha-dha!

10:18.344 --> 10:19.906
Come on, JD, this is the perfect gift.

10:20.266 --> 10:22.977
You can't be driving 40 minutes
on a scooter to go to see your kid.

10:23.338 --> 10:25.478
Plus, this is a hybrid.
So you save tons on gas.

10:25.816 --> 10:28.362
- I don't want your charity, Dan. Take it back.
- No, judge.

10:29.135 --> 10:31.050
Really? Well, if it's mine...

10:31.342 --> 10:34.271
than I guess that you
won't care if I do this.

10:36.583 --> 10:39.438
Wow! This tee must have
fantastic crash-test reading.

10:41.976 --> 10:43.951
Hey, you! Come over here
and read this number, will you?

10:44.507 --> 10:46.437
No, Boone.
I will kill your family.

10:46.489 --> 10:48.238
- Don't wait up and stumbles!
- Or you say bye to baby Boone!

10:50.070 --> 10:52.128
Got it!
298!

10:53.601 --> 10:57.325
Minus my superbuff 180 pounds
make your weight...

10:57.904 --> 10:59.826
118!

11:00.892 --> 11:05.578
Which is a full one pound less
than your patient who is in trouble.

11:06.269 --> 11:08.349
Hypocrisy, thy name is, Boone?

11:08.350 --> 11:10.091
Do you wanna finish that for me? No?

11:10.092 --> 11:11.758
- Much more eonugh to follow?
- No.

11:11.759 --> 11:13.095
Is you, Barbie.

11:13.861 --> 11:16.076
Hypocrisy, thy name is you.

11:24.930 --> 11:26.184
I'll take a quick breather.

11:26.507 --> 11:30.344
JD, I enjoyed demostration of your lack of
phisical strenght as much as an ex guy, but

11:30.840 --> 11:31.666
What's your problem?

11:32.245 --> 11:36.111
Dan, you come here with a new job,
a new house and you give me a car?

11:36.421 --> 11:37.439
So what?

11:37.786 --> 11:38.650
<i>Don't say it.</i>

11:39.431 --> 11:40.918
You're supposed to be the loser, not me.

11:43.614 --> 11:44.748
Finally! I looseened it.

11:45.003 --> 11:48.390
<i>And than Dan said the last thing
I ever expected to hear from him.</i>

11:48.585 --> 11:50.029
You know what, JD?

11:50.826 --> 11:51.801
You need to grow up.

11:55.495 --> 11:57.650
You shouldn't mess with hybrid cars.

11:58.694 --> 12:00.424
- Be gentile.
- Nope.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.115
I wasn't speaking to my brother,

12:04.288 --> 12:06.353
Of course Dan reacted in
the way he always does.

12:06.354 --> 12:09.679
He becaime it character he like
to call "The constant questioner".

12:10.572 --> 12:12.652
Who's that guy?
What behind that door?

12:12.653 --> 12:15.986
When is the next bus to Chicago?
7 o'clock p.m. 300. Where is that girl going?

12:15.987 --> 12:19.704
Wanna see me doin' a funny dance?
Wanna see me do it around you?

12:22.415 --> 12:23.849
Break it! Break it! Break it!

12:25.329 --> 12:29.226
New from Mattel it's... Hypocrite Barbie!

12:29.661 --> 12:32.326
Now, when you do waltz into your similarly

12:32.327 --> 12:35.886
stick-like patient's room,
I don't want you to feel guilty

12:35.887 --> 12:39.822
because you brought on a bag of
salary stakes and air for lunch today.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.306
<i>It's not about you, it's about her.</i>

12:47.615 --> 12:51.791
Robin, this colleague of mine pointed out that
i could also stantic pain a few pounds, and...??

12:51.792 --> 12:54.502
I don't wanna be a hipocrite, so how
about you and I do it together?

12:55.013 --> 12:55.764
Sure.

12:57.896 --> 13:01.256
- He's got crazy eyes.
- I do. Normally kill you.

13:05.128 --> 13:07.959
That's very wasteful. Must you
wash your hands so often?

13:08.176 --> 13:11.067
I just changed an 80 year-old man's
diaper, and I'm about to eat'em off,

13:11.068 --> 13:12.877
and so, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna wash away.

13:13.072 --> 13:16.121
Oooh, I do not wanna see this.

13:18.247 --> 13:19.073
See what?

13:20.050 --> 13:22.610
He expects me to make you drink my mop water.

13:23.185 --> 13:26.124
But... my bucket is all the way down
the stairs, so I'll let you off the hook,

13:26.161 --> 13:27.972
if you promise never to tell Ted.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.203
-Yes?
-No.

13:29.526 --> 13:30.509
I'm gonna take that as "yes".

13:33.077 --> 13:34.519
That's it! Drink it down, baby.

13:35.089 --> 13:37.337
All the sods, too! You've learned a lesson.

13:37.394 --> 13:38.671
Move it, Jolly-green.

13:39.812 --> 13:40.777
What's up your butt?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.908
Yesterday Dan told me that I need to grow up.

13:44.258 --> 13:47.224
Me?! I mean, you don't think that, do you?

13:49.987 --> 13:53.787
What followed was what I like to call
"the hedgign noise symphony"

13:53.988 --> 13:55.625
- Uhm..
- Er...

13:55.626 --> 13:56.962
- I...
- Uhm...

13:57.105 --> 13:58.532
- Er..
- So...

13:58.533 --> 13:59.801
- Uhm...
- I...

13:59.869 --> 14:01.281
- So...
- Well...

14:01.282 --> 14:02.084
Ha!

14:02.085 --> 14:05.087
I-I-I-I-Er-O-Ah-I...

14:05.117 --> 14:07.332
Mmh-Er-Ha!

14:07.460 --> 14:11.463
I-I-I-Well-Er-If-See-Well-Hm-Well-Ha!

14:11.545 --> 14:15.307
You-I-I-See-I-Aah-I-Ah-Ah-Uhm-Ha!

14:15.322 --> 14:20.384
You-Well-I-Well-I-Well-I-See-Uhm-Ha-haaaa!

14:21.750 --> 14:23.113
Do you think I need to grow up?

14:25.641 --> 14:26.159
Well...

14:27.301 --> 14:31.273
You dream your whole life about that moment,
and when it finally comes, you just...

14:32.564 --> 14:35.365
you're just not ready for it. Here it goes:

14:35.696 --> 14:37.978
the answer is a sincere, enfatic,

14:38.287 --> 14:41.801
100%definitiveneverbeensosureof
anithinginmylifeunequivocal...

14:41.951 --> 14:45.736
Yes, and the fact that you came to me
means everibody else thinks so, too.

14:46.645 --> 14:47.163
Am I right?

14:48.229 --> 14:49.183
Yes.

14:50.295 --> 14:51.233
Yes.

14:51.901 --> 14:52.682
Oh, yeah.

14:53.268 --> 14:54.634
Oh, hell's yeah.

14:56.046 --> 14:58.254
I just needed to find someone who really understood me.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.567
Ooh! My scar!

15:02.078 --> 15:04.886
- Is that face paint?
- Yeah, Carla wants me to trash it.

15:05.509 --> 15:06.493
<i>Oh, really?</i>

15:07.026 --> 15:08.175
Dribble me!

15:13.469 --> 15:14.670
Between the legs!

15:17.981 --> 15:20.024
- Wow, Elliot, double dessert?
-Yeah.

15:20.061 --> 15:22.284
I promised a patient that we'd
gain weight together, so...

15:22.343 --> 15:23.155
Wow...

15:23.696 --> 15:28.104
It's not every doctor that would take a hot bod
like yours and go all jiggly for a patient.

15:29.519 --> 15:33.969
Has anyone else noticed how fantastic
Dr.Reid has been looking lately?

15:35.216 --> 15:36.372
Sop girl.

15:38.776 --> 15:39.414
That'll do do it.

15:41.832 --> 15:44.332
Hey, why didn't you throw
that in the recycling?

15:44.623 --> 15:46.552
The recycling bin is way over there...

15:49.251 --> 15:50.775
What happened to you?

15:51.249 --> 15:53.712
You're going to change the world, man!

15:54.906 --> 15:57.204
I've learned to pick
my battles in this world,

15:57.234 --> 16:00.027
otherwise ya fight, and ya fight, and
one day you'll look in the mirror

16:00.028 --> 16:01.473
and there's an old man looking back atcha,

16:01.474 --> 16:03.283
and you have to ask yourself
"was it all worthy?"

16:03.655 --> 16:05.539
It's been 36 hours!

16:07.379 --> 16:09.264
I'm going to say something to you,

16:09.715 --> 16:13.270
that's been said to me by
every person I've ever loved

16:14.611 --> 16:17.648
I'm really disappointed in you,
you're pathetic and weak,

16:17.649 --> 16:20.187
and I don't love you anymore. Get out!

16:24.567 --> 16:26.234
You don't think I need to
grow up, do you, Turk?

16:26.880 --> 16:27.639
Definitley.

16:27.932 --> 16:30.059
That means a lot, coming from a
guy who painted his head

16:30.060 --> 16:31.651
like some sort of a sports ball.

16:32.077 --> 16:32.745
Buddy,

16:33.084 --> 16:35.103
A one thing I love about hanging out with you

16:35.104 --> 16:37.386
is that we get to do stuff
like this, you know, but...

16:38.085 --> 16:40.316
when you leave I go back
to be a husband and a father.

16:40.399 --> 16:41.833
which means paying bills,

16:41.908 --> 16:45.160
giving my daughter a bath, and budging on
with Carla so that we can buy a house.

16:46.008 --> 16:46.759
Well, you...

16:47.547 --> 16:50.723
Have you had your baby pooped your apartment
and learned how to change a diaper?

16:51.429 --> 16:52.826
Aren't there any instructions on the box?

16:54.117 --> 16:55.994
Have you seen your baby
since Kim took him home?

16:57.068 --> 16:57.564
No...

16:58.457 --> 17:00.350
Now I say, you think you need to grow up?

17:04.518 --> 17:05.719
Do it, do it now.

17:08.655 --> 17:09.481
Are you done?

17:09.751 --> 17:11.711
I can't believe I'm such a hypocrite.

17:12.048 --> 17:14.842
I can't believe I gave up saving
the world after 36 hours!

17:15.867 --> 17:17.411
I don't deserve to wear this sash.

17:19.739 --> 17:20.528
I like it on.

17:21.962 --> 17:23.509
You two are so boring.

17:23.877 --> 17:24.973
Janitors aren't boring.

17:25.155 --> 17:28.631
You wanna know the weird defect you both
have that make you screw up like this?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.929
- Please...
- You're both humans.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.024
- Janitors aren't human.
- They are!

17:33.123 --> 17:36.667
And Elliot, I'm really annoyed with you
because I gave you this lecture 2 weeks ago.

17:37.771 --> 17:41.819
<i>Pay attention, because I don't wanna be
saying the same thing again in two weeks.</i>

17:42.592 --> 17:44.349
<i>You're both human.</i>

17:47.135 --> 17:47.983
I don't recall that.

17:48.224 --> 17:51.753
It's human who want the best for your patient,
even if you can't follow your own advice.

17:51.963 --> 17:54.900
It's human to get passionate about
something and then get complacent.

17:54.952 --> 17:57.941
It's annoying to whine about it all the time!

17:58.338 --> 17:59.344
Janitors don't whine.

18:00.628 --> 18:02.445
Oh, wait, yes we do. That's our thing.

18:05.231 --> 18:07.026
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:07.537 --> 18:08.423
Wanna see the dance again?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.029
Tikitiki Toocatooca Yum Yum!

18:11.030 --> 18:14.708
Actually, Dan, I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to go over to Kim's and me and...

18:16.014 --> 18:16.953
meet my son.

18:18.552 --> 18:20.887
Yeah, yeah. I'm great.

18:26.962 --> 18:27.901
You know, JD...

18:29.924 --> 18:32.174
You're the one who told me to get
my life together in the first place.

18:32.693 --> 18:34.112
Well, I never thought you'd do it.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.334
Uh, it's so lovely saying to me.

18:38.588 --> 18:40.113
I'm happy for you, Dan.

18:44.858 --> 18:46.180
You don't know how to turn it on, do you?

18:46.721 --> 18:50.063
No idea. I... pushed it from
the parking spot, back there.

18:50.168 --> 18:53.284
- Ok, well, you see this button?
- Yeah, discovered, that's the stereo.

18:53.577 --> 18:54.613
And if you push this up...

18:55.529 --> 18:56.437
Clearly a vent.

18:56.572 --> 18:58.615
<i>It's hard to own up to your shortcomings.</i>

18:59.065 --> 19:01.430
<i>Like friends tease your own hypocrisy.</i>

19:02.324 --> 19:04.862
April, the nurses told me
that you've been ill enough.

19:06.102 --> 19:07.108
Well, what about you?

19:07.408 --> 19:09.571
This isn't about me, I'm not
the one fainting at the office,

19:09.572 --> 19:11.470
just... do what I tell you to do.

19:12.349 --> 19:14.384
Barbie... there you are.

19:14.707 --> 19:16.674
You're standing sideways so I didn't see ya.

19:20.790 --> 19:23.147
<i>Still, once you do homenut,
you might be surprised</i>

19:23.148 --> 19:25.385
to see that you did make a difference.

19:26.144 --> 19:30.353
Dammit! Next time you guys get
pastring crums all over my car

19:30.354 --> 19:32.579
you ain't better bring
a scorn for the driver.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.432
Well what do you know? Your carpool thing's stuck.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.122
I guess it's something, right?

19:38.902 --> 19:42.777
<i>As for me, I always assumed growing up
happened dogmatically as you got older</i>

19:43.370 --> 19:45.518
<i>but it's really something you
have to choose to do.</i>

19:46.336 --> 19:48.912
- See you tomorrow, Sam, I promise.
- Night, buddy.

19:51.495 --> 19:53.726
<i>I guess I'm finally on my way.</i>

19:59.275 --> 20:00.431
He looks like dad.

20:02.396 --> 20:03.567
I know.

20:05.857 --> 20:08.328
