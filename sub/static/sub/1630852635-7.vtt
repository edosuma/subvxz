WEBVTT

00:12.041 --> 00:14.083
[Mirana] My father
would have seen this coming.

00:14.166 --> 00:17.708
Selemene as well.
How could I've been so blind?

00:17.791 --> 00:19.500
And you were raised for better things.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.958
Been years since I stormed a castle.

00:22.041 --> 00:25.083
I never have. But it is on my list.

00:25.166 --> 00:28.000
Having had my castle stormed,
I can tell you it's not great.

00:29.583 --> 00:31.958
No, this is my fight.

00:32.041 --> 00:33.833
[Mirana] Travel to the enclaves.

00:33.916 --> 00:36.291
-Free our brothers and sisters.
-[Luna] And you.

00:36.375 --> 00:40.083
A reckoning here.
I was raised for better things.

00:40.166 --> 00:43.416
Recent experience
has prepared me for worse.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.666
I'll bring an army when I'm done.

00:45.750 --> 00:49.833
Huh. Such a frail little girl
when you came to us.

00:49.916 --> 00:52.500
Never understood
what the goddess saw in you.

00:52.583 --> 00:53.416
Now, I do.

00:54.666 --> 00:57.583
[Luna] I am honored to call you Princess.

01:02.958 --> 01:04.958
[theme music playing]

01:52.750 --> 01:54.750
[pensive music playing]

02:00.750 --> 02:02.875
[grandiose music playing]

02:25.666 --> 02:27.416
[Lina] I think that's
what you're looking for.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.916
It is.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.916
-[Lina] It's been a long journey.
-Too long.

02:37.666 --> 02:38.875
[exhales deeply]

02:39.958 --> 02:41.125
[grunts softly]

02:43.791 --> 02:44.833
[grunts]

02:45.666 --> 02:46.500
[Davion] Nothing.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.708
I feel nothing at all. It's a fake.

02:53.458 --> 02:56.708
[Lina] Maybe it's not a forgery.
Maybe it's all just a lie.

02:56.791 --> 02:59.833
Shabarra never had any real power.
It was obvious.

02:59.916 --> 03:01.958
Should be obvious to everyone now.

03:02.041 --> 03:04.875
And Sal before him.
What does it take to kill a god?

03:04.958 --> 03:06.041
A real god?

03:06.125 --> 03:08.416
Slyrak would have known.
He would have warned me.

03:09.166 --> 03:11.666
You spent months failing
to understand Slyrak.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.000
But one fever dream
with a little blue rock

03:14.083 --> 03:15.833
and suddenly, it all makes sense?

03:15.916 --> 03:19.708
Maybe he just grabbed onto the first thing
that felt like an answer and clung to it.

03:19.791 --> 03:21.333
Now nothing is what it's supposed to be,

03:21.416 --> 03:25.333
and all you have left
is grappling with an inconvenient reality.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.125
We're missing something.

03:32.333 --> 03:33.166
[Sagan groans]

03:33.250 --> 03:35.958
[Mirana] I'll need you to find Davion.
He should hear about Lina.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.416
He should know exactly
who he's supporting.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.208
Sure. Right. Will do.

03:41.291 --> 03:45.125
You agreed three times.
You must have great enthusiasm for this.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.791
I'm brimming over with it.

03:46.875 --> 03:50.041
-You have a doubt?
-Absolutely not. Not at all.

03:50.125 --> 03:50.958
[inhales sharply]

03:51.041 --> 03:55.375
Except, I just wonder
if we're not rushing to judgment a little?

03:55.458 --> 03:56.916
Facts are facts.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.500
[Bram] Oh, definitely. No question.

03:59.583 --> 04:03.125
-Except… are they?
-Luna knows what she saw.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.458
Look, I don't know Luna,
but I kind of know Lina.

04:06.541 --> 04:08.916
Luna, Lina, that's not confusing at all.
[inhales deeply]

04:09.000 --> 04:11.041
Anyway, it seems to me
even if she was there,

04:11.125 --> 04:14.416
hunting assassins is kind of her job.
Her old job, anyway.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.083
Which is why she set the world on fire
and fled the scene.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.166
Davion had just dropped
the emperor off a roof

04:20.250 --> 04:22.000
and he was busy wrecking
the Praetorian Guard.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.666
I don't understand
why you would defend her.

04:23.750 --> 04:25.416
I'm not defending Lina at all.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.375
[exhales deeply]
I'm defending Davion.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.541
He has a pretty good judge of people.
They have a connection.

04:30.625 --> 04:32.416
If Lina were capable
of something like this,

04:32.500 --> 04:35.750
Davion would know. He'd walk away.

04:35.833 --> 04:38.708
But I will talk to him.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.083
[Terrorblade] Deny his lies.

04:45.041 --> 04:47.291
-Deny him.
-[gasps]

04:49.500 --> 04:51.166
[whimpers]

04:53.041 --> 04:54.125
[Fymryn grunts]

04:54.208 --> 04:57.333
If you had brought Davion home,
this would all be over.

04:57.416 --> 05:01.416
You lied to me.
You used me. I believed in you.

05:01.500 --> 05:05.333
Everyone makes choices.
Some wise, some less so.

05:05.416 --> 05:08.458
But you've learned
the most important lesson.

05:08.541 --> 05:10.583
People will disappoint you.

05:11.541 --> 05:13.750
I can recover from our errors.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.875
-Selemene is here at the tower.
-[gasps]

05:15.958 --> 05:18.125
[Invoker] Powerless. I've seen to that.

05:18.208 --> 05:22.375
I ask only that you reclaim
what is rightfully yours.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.125
Rightfully mine?

05:24.208 --> 05:27.083
[Invoker] You will take her divine spark.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.916
You are Mene. Goddess of the moon.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.125
Reborn.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.541
[birds chirping]

05:33.625 --> 05:35.250
[Mirana] You're giving me that look again.

05:35.333 --> 05:39.500
I can't say I missed it.
I did the best I could with what I had.

05:39.583 --> 05:42.333
You weren't here.
All I wanted was a way out.

05:42.416 --> 05:44.291
Fighting chance.

05:44.375 --> 05:47.333
Perhaps I misjudged.
Perhaps I was overconfident.

05:47.416 --> 05:50.000
But what would you have me do?
I can't leave now.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.125
And no. My ego is not in the way.

05:52.208 --> 05:53.166
[scoffs]

05:53.250 --> 05:55.375
The woman tried to have me killed.

05:55.458 --> 05:58.041
I can't just let that pass.
I can't just let her win.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.250
You're right. I sound just like Davion.

06:05.375 --> 06:09.875
The assassin has disappeared.
One witness is an escaped convict.

06:09.958 --> 06:14.250
-The other, an enemy of the empire.
-Irrelevant. Their story is true.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.458
She tried to have me killed
for her own political gain.

06:17.541 --> 06:19.000
I believe you.

06:19.083 --> 06:23.541
Even if the Senate believes you too,
they will never turn against the Slayer.

06:25.041 --> 06:28.750
I'm sorry, Sunbeam.
There is nothing you can do.

06:29.708 --> 06:33.583
But perhaps I can help.

06:34.916 --> 06:35.875
[groans]

06:36.500 --> 06:38.333
I thought maybe time of day.

06:38.416 --> 06:40.916
Dawn didn't work. Maybe noon is better.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.458
-I wish it were. Truly.
-Just put it away.

06:44.541 --> 06:47.041
The real one is out there.
I have to find it.

06:47.125 --> 06:49.416
-[Lina] I keep trying to tell you.
-To give up?

06:49.500 --> 06:50.750
To face reality.

06:50.833 --> 06:55.750
Real? In this place?
Nothing is real here. Everyone lies.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.958
Everyone is hiding a knife somewhere.
You've even got me doing it.

06:59.625 --> 07:03.375
[Davion] The official story?
Lina, I murdered someone.

07:03.458 --> 07:04.791
I started a war.

07:04.875 --> 07:08.333
You and everyone else seem perfectly okay
with pretending I'm not the reason.

07:08.416 --> 07:09.625
[Lina] Because you're not the reason.

07:09.708 --> 07:12.583
The Eye is a fake.
Mirana won't speak to me,

07:12.666 --> 07:14.500
the whole damned world
is coming to an end.

07:14.583 --> 07:15.958
-And--
-[Lina] Davion.

07:16.041 --> 07:18.625
You're not the reason. I am.

07:18.708 --> 07:23.291
You are the only thing that makes sense
in this whole fucking mess.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.000
[Lina] I thought he would abdicate.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.166
-[Davion] What are you talking about?
-[Lina] Shabarra.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.166
When your princess died,

07:29.250 --> 07:31.875
I thought he would be exposed
for what he was.

07:31.958 --> 07:34.250
A fraud. I thought he would abdicate.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.166
I thought the Senate
would make him abdicate.

07:36.250 --> 07:39.375
I more or less took that option
off the table when I killed him.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.916
You're not understanding me.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.291
I hired the assassin
who tried to kill Mirana.

07:44.375 --> 07:48.166
Hellbear shit. I would know!
I would feel it from you.

07:48.250 --> 07:52.500
Shopkeeper Jim. Oath of silence.
No, you wouldn't.

07:53.833 --> 07:54.791
Don't tell me this.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.416
I have to.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.750
I've been alone my whole life.
Then you walked into it.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.583
I thought I had this figured out. I…

08:02.666 --> 08:05.250
I thought I was so smart.
I thought I could live with it.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.791
I can live with a lot of things.

08:06.875 --> 08:10.041
I can even live with you walking out
the door and telling the world.

08:10.125 --> 08:14.041
But lying to you makes me feel alone again
and I can't live with that.

08:15.166 --> 08:18.708
All this time, I thought the worst thing
that could ever happen

08:18.791 --> 08:22.500
was Terrorblade reshaping
the universe to his liking.

08:22.583 --> 08:25.250
Now, I wonder if he hasn't already.

08:26.458 --> 08:27.750
[grunts]

08:31.666 --> 08:33.541
[birds chirping]

08:36.250 --> 08:38.250
[somber music playing]

08:40.166 --> 08:41.250
[Bram] Davion.

08:41.333 --> 08:44.333
Uh, listen,
there's something you should know.

08:44.416 --> 08:47.125
I don't know if it's true,
but you should probably hear about it.

08:47.208 --> 08:49.250
It's about… Hey.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.375
You don't look so good.

08:51.458 --> 08:55.083
Lina hired the assassin.
She told me everything.

08:55.166 --> 08:59.666
Oh, you know, good.
Credit for honesty, I suppose.

08:59.750 --> 09:01.833
Give us the room, please.

09:06.541 --> 09:07.750
[door closes]

09:07.833 --> 09:11.041
I am so stupid. I'm so sorry.

09:15.291 --> 09:17.291
[somber music playing]

09:20.375 --> 09:23.625
Beliefs change. Trust breaks.

09:23.708 --> 09:26.125
Faith endures.
[inhales sharply]

09:26.208 --> 09:30.458
For a thousand years,
the exiled Coriel'Tauvi knew darkness.

09:30.541 --> 09:33.708
[Invoker] Mene was gone. Slain.

09:33.791 --> 09:37.458
Yet her people still worshipped.
They loved.

09:38.500 --> 09:43.083
They offered faith to dark shrines
in remembrance of a dead goddess.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.333
But love is a powerful magic.

09:45.416 --> 09:48.666
It is the highest form of worship. Divine.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.083
Even in the absence of a deity.

09:51.166 --> 09:55.375
Love for our goddess found echo
in the sparks Selemene had stolen.

09:55.458 --> 09:56.458
[Invoker sighs]

09:56.541 --> 09:59.916
Over time, Mene's echo took form.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.125
It became manifest.

10:02.208 --> 10:05.333
A physical expression
of pure, collective will.

10:05.416 --> 10:07.750
Need. Love.

10:07.833 --> 10:12.541
It became a child. It became you.

10:12.625 --> 10:16.375
-I just… I have abilities.
-The goddess's abilities.

10:16.458 --> 10:19.083
Weakened to be sure, but they are hers.

10:19.166 --> 10:22.125
-[Fymryn] How long have you believed this?
-Since you saw my tower.

10:22.208 --> 10:25.208
You should have told me then.
You kept this to yourself.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.541
You would not have heard the words.
You would not have wanted to hear.

10:28.625 --> 10:30.791
[sighs]
But now, our people need you.

10:30.875 --> 10:34.208
[Invoker] The Coriel'Tauvi are drunk
on their own rage.

10:34.291 --> 10:40.541
You've seen it. They await your return.
Believing you will fuel their shrines,

10:40.625 --> 10:44.208
carry them from battle to battle
at this speed of thought,

10:44.291 --> 10:47.166
wherever the moon shines down
on their narrow world.

10:47.250 --> 10:51.291
I tried to make them stop.
I begged them. My own family.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.791
That means nothing to them now.

10:53.875 --> 10:57.875
The only voice they will hear
is the voice of their goddess.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.208
I wish it could be different.

11:01.208 --> 11:03.291
You are a gentle soul.

11:03.375 --> 11:05.875
-But you must kill Selemene.
-I can't.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.958
Then watch our people drown the world
in innocent blood.

11:09.041 --> 11:12.250
-The choice is yours.
-Not even your magic can kill a god.

11:12.333 --> 11:13.375
[scoffs]

11:14.041 --> 11:17.416
Of course it can. I've done it before.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.708
I lived by a code my whole life.

11:20.791 --> 11:24.500
But since all this started,
I've broken it over and over.

11:24.583 --> 11:28.333
Every single time I told myself
I had to do it, it was necessary.

11:28.416 --> 11:30.166
I didn't know what I was walking into.

11:30.250 --> 11:33.333
Now, it's all upside down and sideways.

11:33.416 --> 11:35.958
You never liked to run from a fight.

11:36.041 --> 11:39.583
Consider the possibility,
you don't always have to run into them.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.500
-That's what Kaden said.
-You saw Kaden?

11:42.583 --> 11:45.416
Very long story.
But I should have listened to him.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.916
I think I could tell you a similar story.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.375
[sighs]
What a pair we are.

11:51.458 --> 11:55.541
And now we have nothing.
No throne, no Eye, no chance.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.708
The Eye has to be real.

11:57.791 --> 12:01.250
My father's power was real.
I saw it, felt it.

12:01.333 --> 12:04.250
Maybe it really was replaced.
By someone with access.

12:04.333 --> 12:07.041
Someone who could accept
your uncle in the chair

12:07.125 --> 12:08.958
but didn't want him on the throne.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.291
Not really, not completely.

12:11.375 --> 12:15.166
There would have been
only one opportunity.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.458
Where are we going?

12:22.041 --> 12:23.500
To find a witness.

12:24.375 --> 12:28.291
[indistinct chatter]

12:28.375 --> 12:30.125
[crowd cheering]

12:30.208 --> 12:31.875
[grunting]

12:32.750 --> 12:35.625
-Uh, Asar?
-Princess?

12:35.708 --> 12:36.875
-[grunts]
-[groans]

12:36.958 --> 12:38.500
[crowd] Yeah!

12:38.583 --> 12:41.666
That did not count. I demand a rematch!

12:42.708 --> 12:47.208
Forgive my appearance, Your Highness.
I've been in my cups.

12:47.291 --> 12:51.291
No, forgive me for interrupting
your revels, Captain.

12:51.375 --> 12:54.333
And I was hoping we could speak.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.583
[man grunting]

12:56.666 --> 12:58.916
[crowd cheering]

12:59.000 --> 13:00.333
[gasping]

13:01.166 --> 13:02.916
[gulps, burps]

13:03.458 --> 13:05.291
[all cheering]

13:05.375 --> 13:08.416
She's unusually strong and yet so small.

13:08.500 --> 13:12.083
You should ask her what she eats.
Perhaps it would help you.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.041
[Asar] I remember that night well.

13:14.125 --> 13:18.250
The panic. The fighting in the streets.
The fires.

13:18.333 --> 13:21.125
Then Shabarra's soldiers
breached the palace.

13:21.208 --> 13:25.416
The viceroy found me.
Ordered me to get you to safety.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.625
That's when I knew the fight was lost.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.041
I couldn't save your parents

13:31.125 --> 13:34.916
but I was ready
to give my life to save you.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.250
It's not your fault, Asar.
I don't blame you.

13:38.333 --> 13:41.791
But I have to know, how did my father die?

13:41.875 --> 13:44.708
I don't know how it happened. Truly.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.750
I just remember that sound,
that terrible sound.

13:47.833 --> 13:49.833
-Stand fast!
-[Asar] That hum.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.708
I could feel it in the wall. I just…

13:51.791 --> 13:55.458
The floor. Shaking my bones, my teeth.

13:55.541 --> 14:00.208
The whole world seemed to stop.
I couldn't move.

14:00.291 --> 14:04.000
That's when I knew the emperor was dead.

14:04.083 --> 14:06.750
The Eye. Was it also smuggled
out of the palace?

14:06.833 --> 14:10.291
-No, only the emperor may touch it.
-I think someone did.

14:10.375 --> 14:13.000
-I think they replaced it with a forgery.
-Impossible!

14:13.083 --> 14:16.291
Yet it seems it's true.
Who could have taken it?

14:16.375 --> 14:18.666
Who could even get near it
other than the emperor?

14:18.750 --> 14:21.833
Viceroy Kashurra? Seneschal Ekur?

14:21.916 --> 14:24.875
Perhaps the Legati?
But the guard would know.

14:24.958 --> 14:26.666
No one would dare.

14:27.791 --> 14:28.625
[Sagan groans]

14:28.708 --> 14:31.458
The night Asar whisked me
out of the Imperium,

14:31.541 --> 14:33.541
that was the worst night of my life.

14:33.625 --> 14:34.833
I can only imagine.

14:34.916 --> 14:38.833
[Mirana] You don't have to imagine.
You know. You've lost as I've lost.

14:38.916 --> 14:41.583
Seems there's always
something new to lose.

14:41.666 --> 14:43.791
And find again.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.291
Kashurra has to know.

14:45.375 --> 14:49.375
I think he knew Shabarra was a fraud.
And I think he knew why.

14:49.458 --> 14:51.916
He stood there and did nothing
when I attacked.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.541
He made up the cover story.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.958
I think he did it all out of loyalty
to your family.

14:56.041 --> 15:00.000
If he has the Eye,
we have to convince him to show us.

15:00.083 --> 15:04.291
You have to convince him.
I think you're the only one who can.

15:05.666 --> 15:07.833
[somber music playing]

15:18.625 --> 15:20.500
[breathes heavily]

15:25.500 --> 15:30.458
You're her. Selemene.
The Dark Moon Goddess.

15:30.541 --> 15:34.666
A goddess without worshippers.
Without love.

15:34.750 --> 15:37.625
Just another part of his collection.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.208
You're the thief?

15:40.916 --> 15:45.333
-The one who stole my lotuses.
-I only wanted to bring my people home.

15:45.416 --> 15:47.541
A home you stole from us
a thousand years ago.

15:48.125 --> 15:53.375
[Selemene] The Coriel'Tauvi spurned
my love. Refused to worship me.

15:53.458 --> 15:56.458
I did not banish them
from the Nightsilver Woods.

15:56.541 --> 15:58.541
They left of their own free will.

15:58.625 --> 16:02.875
Those who remained,
accepted me as their goddess.

16:02.958 --> 16:06.291
We lived in peace. I left you to your own.

16:06.375 --> 16:08.833
[Fymryn] That's not in the stories.

16:08.916 --> 16:11.750
Not in your stories.

16:11.833 --> 16:13.625
You're saying our stories are lies.

16:14.583 --> 16:16.500
All stories are lies.

16:18.166 --> 16:21.125
It's strange. I feel I know you.

16:21.208 --> 16:23.875
From the paintings, the statues.

16:23.958 --> 16:26.291
Her journal. This was her room.

16:28.833 --> 16:29.791
It was.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.333
A long time ago.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.708
Come, thief.

16:35.416 --> 16:37.500
Let me have a closer look at you.

16:39.125 --> 16:43.791
Tell me, what more
would you steal from me?

16:45.958 --> 16:47.375
I don't want anything from you.

16:49.250 --> 16:51.666
-Follow me.
-Where are we going?

16:52.875 --> 16:53.916
To Filomena.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
[tranquil music playing]

16:58.333 --> 16:59.208
[exhales deeply]

17:00.708 --> 17:01.666
[sobs]

17:03.250 --> 17:04.500
[Selemene] My girl.

17:05.875 --> 17:06.791
She loved me.

17:09.583 --> 17:10.416
Huh.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.083
[gasping]

17:13.833 --> 17:15.000
[gasps]

17:16.458 --> 17:18.458
[dreamy music playing]

17:25.583 --> 17:27.125
[Fymryn] No!

17:34.541 --> 17:39.708
Thank you, little Coedwen,
for setting things right.

17:39.791 --> 17:42.500
I will not forget your kindness.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.333
You've no idea what madness
you've loosed on the world.

17:53.750 --> 17:54.916
[door closes]

17:55.000 --> 17:57.666
[murmuring]

17:58.958 --> 18:00.291
[Lina] Viceroy.

18:00.375 --> 18:03.291
It's a bit late in the day
for a dramatic entrance.

18:03.375 --> 18:06.416
You are dismissed. All of you.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.875
We weren't finished.

18:14.916 --> 18:17.791
[Kashurra] I've never had
much enthusiasm for you, Lina.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.291
You're gifted with great power,

18:20.375 --> 18:23.375
but it's made you impulsive
and intemperate.

18:23.458 --> 18:26.875
Unpredictable.
Very poor qualities in a leader.

18:26.958 --> 18:29.500
You forgot your place very quickly.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.916
And you overstepped.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.041
[Kashurra] The Imperium is a machine.

18:35.125 --> 18:38.750
Every gear, every cog,
must do its job reliably.

18:38.833 --> 18:42.958
This includes the Emperor,
who is merely a part of the machine

18:43.041 --> 18:45.375
and does not truly direct it.

18:45.458 --> 18:51.250
Successful emperors understand this.
And so, the machine runs smoothly.

18:51.333 --> 18:55.166
Unsuccessful emperors
fall into the clockwork.

18:55.250 --> 18:58.166
The machine tears them apart.

18:58.250 --> 19:01.208
You've just described
everything wrong with the Imperium.

19:01.291 --> 19:06.041
I'm gonna smash your dawn-forsaken machine
and build something new! Something better!

19:06.125 --> 19:07.666
[Kashurra] Every emperor thinks that.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.375
For my part,
I was willing to give you a chance.

19:10.458 --> 19:13.750
Help you adapt.
But you made a terrible mistake.

19:13.833 --> 19:16.291
You tried to kill my Sunbeam.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.500
Dawn Star.

19:21.875 --> 19:23.583
[grunts]

19:23.666 --> 19:25.375
[Lina screams]

19:26.166 --> 19:27.375
[grunts]

19:28.458 --> 19:29.375
[screams]

19:30.833 --> 19:32.958
[action music playing]

19:41.291 --> 19:42.166
[gasps]

19:42.250 --> 19:43.958
What… What are you?

19:44.041 --> 19:45.333
Death.

19:48.791 --> 19:50.750
She was so alone.

19:50.833 --> 19:51.833
So sad.

19:51.916 --> 19:54.333
When the moment came, I… I couldn't do it.

19:54.416 --> 19:56.875
[Invoker] She has not earned
your sympathy.

19:56.958 --> 19:59.791
Have any of us? And isn't that the point?

19:59.875 --> 20:04.000
You say my family will listen to me
and live in peace if only I asked them.

20:04.083 --> 20:06.541
But the only way they'll listen
is if I shed blood.

20:06.625 --> 20:07.625
No.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.583
-There must be another way.
-There is no other way!

20:10.666 --> 20:13.166
Life was good before I tried
to make it better.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.708
Maybe Selemene
should be goddess of the moon.

20:15.791 --> 20:18.166
Maybe everything
can just go back to as it was.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.166
[scoffs]

20:19.250 --> 20:23.000
Nothing ever goes back just as it was.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.083
[somber music playing]

20:25.791 --> 20:28.208
[leaves rustling]

20:31.166 --> 20:35.916
His Excellency is away on urgent business.
Please, make yourselves comfortable.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.250
Lovely hoard.

20:40.791 --> 20:43.041
Uh, we call it a collection.

20:43.958 --> 20:48.166
If I had stolen the most holy relic
in the Imperium, I'd keep it here.

20:56.458 --> 20:59.708
-Do you feel that?
-You're right. It's strange.

20:59.791 --> 21:02.166
There's a certain familiarity.

21:02.250 --> 21:05.250
Like being pulled into a fall.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.208
I give up. I don't feel a thing.

21:07.291 --> 21:10.250
-I have a doubt.
-You mean it's right back there?

21:10.333 --> 21:12.375
[Kashurra] How may I be
of service, Princess?

21:13.083 --> 21:16.500
You can start by giving us the Eye.
The real Eye.

21:16.583 --> 21:18.541
I'm afraid I don't understand.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.333
I don't know what's sitting
in the throne room, but it's not the Eye.

21:21.416 --> 21:23.791
I don't care about your politics.

21:23.875 --> 21:26.083
You could have told me.
This would be over.

21:26.166 --> 21:29.958
We believe you may have taken it
the night my parents were murdered.

21:30.041 --> 21:34.375
Well, to protect it,
to keep its power out of my uncle's hands.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.875
But we need it now, please.

21:36.958 --> 21:40.958
I assure you,
the true Eye is in the palace.

21:41.041 --> 21:43.041
-I took nothing.
-[Davion] It doesn't work.

21:43.125 --> 21:46.125
It didn't work for Shabarra,
it didn't work for me.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.125
[Kashurra] Of course, it works.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.958
It is simply
not what you believe it to be.

21:50.041 --> 21:51.583
Enlighten us then.

21:51.666 --> 21:56.416
The Eye does not confer power.
It simply confirms it.

21:56.500 --> 22:02.125
It waits, as it has always waited,
for the true heir to the throne.

22:02.208 --> 22:04.708
It waits for you, Sunbeam.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.041
You didn't steal the Eye.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.041
No one could steal the Eye.

22:10.541 --> 22:12.791
Fine. We'll take this up with Lina.

22:12.875 --> 22:14.083
[Kashurra] Lina will not help you.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.000
No matter what she's done,
she knows how much this matters.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.583
This is no longer her concern.

22:19.666 --> 22:22.791
I said there were things
I could do, Sunbeam.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.750
Things were done.

22:24.833 --> 22:27.000
"Things"? What things?

22:28.041 --> 22:29.500
[Kashurra] The Slayer…

22:32.500 --> 22:33.500
overstepped.

22:34.250 --> 22:36.541
[Mirana] You killed her.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.041
It's not possible.

22:38.125 --> 22:40.583
No one can do what Lina can do.
Not even me.

22:40.666 --> 22:45.458
There is power in the world
beyond the dreams of dragons.

22:47.291 --> 22:48.916
We need to leave!

22:49.750 --> 22:52.958
[Terrorblade] Lina shared the ember soul.

22:53.041 --> 22:56.916
She was a part of me. A child of fire.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.333
Davion, stop!

22:58.416 --> 23:02.041
[Terrorblade] I will quench my rage
in your blood.

23:02.125 --> 23:06.666
I will feast on your flesh in her name.

23:06.750 --> 23:07.916
[roars]

[thrilling music playing]

23:44.541 --> 23:48.708
Lay down your weapon.
I would never harm you…

23:49.750 --> 23:51.791
my little Sunbeam.

23:56.666 --> 23:59.125
[approaching footsteps]

24:01.208 --> 24:02.250

-[soldier] Captain.

[soldiers groaning]

24:04.750 --> 24:06.000
[Hieronimo] Something's wrong.

24:06.666 --> 24:08.916
[soldiers groaning]

24:09.000 --> 24:10.625
I feel her.

24:12.083 --> 24:13.625
Goddess.

[closing theme music playing]
