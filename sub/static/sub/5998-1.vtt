36:39.865 --> 36:42.365
How's it going, Chili?

36:42.367 --> 36:45.569
I got a favor to ask.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.341
Hey, what can I get you folks?

36:51.343 --> 36:52.475
Uh, we just moved in next door.

36:52.477 --> 36:53.643
- Oh.
- Just wanted to stop in

36:53.645 --> 36:55.145
- and say hi.
- Hey.

36:55.146 --> 36:56.646
I'm Ian Bailey Johnson.
This is my wife, Athena...

36:56.648 --> 36:58.648
- Hi.
- Bailey Johnson.

36:58.650 --> 37:02.485
Uh, Her... Herrmann.
The new neighbors are here.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.454
Uh, I'm Brian.
This is Christopher.

37:04.456 --> 37:07.290
- Meet Ian and...
- Athena.

37:07.292 --> 37:08.425
- Right.
- Hey, welcome.

37:08.427 --> 37:09.893
We're big on neighbors
around here.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.228
Where you from?

37:11.230 --> 37:14.764
Uh, Portland, Oregon.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.633
Oh. Yeah.
Wow.

37:16.635 --> 37:17.901
- Welcome to Chicago.
- Thank you.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.869
- [Athena laughs]
- [Herrmann] You're gonna love it here.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.706
- Best city in the world.
- Uh, so, um...

37:22.708 --> 37:24.941
how late does Molly's stay open?

37:24.943 --> 37:26.643
2 A.M.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.246
- Ooh.
- Wow.

37:29.248 --> 37:31.848
Uh, but...
regular bar hours.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.951
And is it always as boisterous
as it's been the last few weeks?

37:36.555 --> 37:39.522
Uh, has the noise been
bothering you guys?

37:39.524 --> 37:42.025
- Yeah.
- It has, actually.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.260
[both laugh] Yeah.

37:43.262 --> 37:44.628
We've got a newborn, so...

37:44.630 --> 37:47.564
- He's a real crier. [laughs]
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.332
Oh, no. [chuckles]

37:49.334 --> 37:51.601
Well, we've got a sign out
front that says, you know,

37:51.603 --> 37:52.769
"Please respect our neighbors."

37:52.771 --> 37:54.871
Usually people are
pretty good about it.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.323
Not too rowdy.

37:56.324 --> 37:57.774
Um, can we offer you guys
a drink on the house?

37:57.776 --> 37:59.376
Uh, not for me 'cause of
the breast feeding,

37:59.378 --> 38:01.711
- but do you, maybe...
- No, no.

38:01.713 --> 38:04.981
We just, uh, wanted to say hi.

38:04.983 --> 38:08.685
- Okay.
- [both] Hi.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.321
Have a good night.

38:13.058 --> 38:14.623
Portland.

38:14.624 --> 38:16.294
[knocking]

38:16.295 --> 38:18.361
Coming!
[music plays in background]

38:18.362 --> 38:20.697
What's up, Cruz?
[music plays in backgorund]

38:22.668 --> 38:23.933
What happened, man?
We got worried about you

38:23.935 --> 38:26.336
when you didn't show up
to Patterson's boat.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.874
Oh.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.043
That's why you blew off
the barbecue.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.644
We thought it's because
you decided not to come back

38:34.646 --> 38:37.647
to Firehouse 51.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.683
I have.

38:41.050 --> 38:43.353
[bottles clinking]
Hey.

38:43.355 --> 38:44.654
Look, man, I know
Patterson isn't exactly...

38:44.656 --> 38:46.056
It's not Patterson.

38:46.058 --> 38:48.058
It's just...

38:49.328 --> 38:50.760
bad situation.

38:50.762 --> 38:53.697
Severide, the whole reason
that I worked my ass off

38:53.699 --> 38:55.598
and trained for squad
was because I wanted

38:55.600 --> 39:00.370
to learn from you.

39:00.372 --> 39:01.604
You go, I go.

39:01.606 --> 39:04.474
Aw, come on, man.
Don't be stupid.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.645
Just think about it.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.880
Okay?

39:20.025 --> 39:25.962

39:25.964 --> 39:28.965

39:46.618 --> 39:48.752
Oh.

39:51.723 --> 39:52.989
- Lieutenant?
- Hey.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.525
Gabriella Dawson
put in for a new turnout coat.

39:55.527 --> 39:57.427
I just need you to okay it.

39:57.429 --> 40:01.564
Thanks.

40:24.689 --> 40:28.425
- Hey, Lieutenant.
- Hey.

40:30.662 --> 40:33.763
- Matt.
- I need to talk to you.

40:36.535 --> 40:37.801
[sighs]

40:37.803 --> 40:39.803
What happened at the club,

40:39.805 --> 40:44.207
when that guy
put his gun to my head...

40:44.209 --> 40:48.678
I've been spinning out,
trying to make sense of it.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.763
- I guess.
- Matt...

40:49.764 --> 40:50.847
And then at the fire,
when the roof went

40:50.849 --> 40:54.684
and you were inside...

40:54.686 --> 40:57.687
All that matters
is that you came out alive.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.689
Because here's the thing:

40:59.691 --> 41:04.160
being with you,
that's what makes sense.

41:05.163 --> 41:08.965
May be the only thing that does.

41:08.967 --> 41:13.770
I don't ever want to let you
out of my life again.

41:16.908 --> 41:22.540
- I'm pregnant.
- [Casey gasps]

41:24.816 --> 41:26.749
Oh.
