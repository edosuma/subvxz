WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.891
Get a load of this loser.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.826
ALBA: Yeah, looks like
a barista or something.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.896
-Probably writes poetry.
-(scoffs)

00:28.929 --> 00:31.365
Is that your boyfriend?

00:31.399 --> 00:32.666
No, that's not my boyfriend.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.934
It's my poetry teacher,
Mr. Reed.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.669
-What?! Are you serious?
-Nailed it.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.171
What are you two so happy about?

00:37.205 --> 00:38.939
Don't worry about it.
Don't you think it's

00:38.972 --> 00:41.675
a little bit late to be getting
a ride home from your teacher?

00:41.709 --> 00:43.444
I was at an open mike night
at the coffee shop he works at.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.779
-What?!
-(gasps) Two times! Two times!

00:45.813 --> 00:46.847
-You're good.
-What is happening?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.116
Eh, nothing.
Just that we are

00:48.149 --> 00:49.550
-psychic as balls.
-Mm-hmm.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.419
And as a psychic person,
I will have you know

00:51.452 --> 00:53.554
it's never a good idea
to have sex with your teacher.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.689
-I'm not sleeping with him.
-Good.

00:55.723 --> 00:58.058
-Yet.
-Wha...? Oh, come on.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.961
Sabrina, I always knew you
were dumb, but I didn't realize

01:00.994 --> 01:03.030
-you were a walking clichÃ©.
-I thought you liked

01:03.063 --> 01:05.099
the pretty morons
with the cheese-grater abs.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.401
Yeah, I did, when I was younger.
But I'm a woman now.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.770
I can grate cheese
on Brian's brains.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.706
Brian sounds like
a real child molester.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.908
Why? Because he thinks
I have a real future?

01:14.942 --> 01:16.444
-In poetry?
-Sure.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.811
Or maybe as a singer/songwriter,

01:17.845 --> 01:19.780
if I ever decide
to put my words to music.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.216
You can't sing. Or write songs.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.286
Come on, open your eyes,
this guy just wants to bang you.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.221
Oh, really?
Then why does he want me to read

01:27.255 --> 01:28.622
my poetry
at the school's Art Fest?

01:28.656 --> 01:30.758
Uh, because he wants
to bang you.

01:30.791 --> 01:31.792
BEN:
I like poetry.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.594
Boat, coat, moat.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.764
Yeah, careful, Ben, she might
fall in love with you, too.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.332
Listen, I had a fling
in high school

01:38.366 --> 01:40.334
with a faculty member,
and it was a big mistake.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.835
You slept with a teacher? Sweet.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.504
No, it was not sweet.
And it wasn't a teacher.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.273
It was just this guy
who worked at the school.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.507
Mm-hmm. Like a janitor?

01:46.540 --> 01:48.142
No, not like a janitor.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.977
He was head of maintenance.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.412
So Kin Janitor.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.414
All that matters is
that it was very traumatic.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.116
Once he got what he wanted
from me, he just blew me off.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.118
And when I tried
to confront him about it,

01:58.152 --> 02:00.321
he-he just acted like
nothing ever happened, you know?

02:00.354 --> 02:02.156
Like I was just
this crazy psycho

02:02.190 --> 02:04.825
who dreamt the whole thing up.
And nobody believed me.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.594
They all trusted
the janitor, huh?

02:06.627 --> 02:10.130
At least the janitor
drove a car.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.467
(thudding)

02:16.537 --> 02:19.640
-Whoa. What's going on?
-I'm trying to stick

02:19.673 --> 02:21.709
the frickin' landing
on the frickin' handspring.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.777
-You got to bend your knees.
-I freaking know that!

02:23.811 --> 02:25.979
Okay, hey, don't snap at me,
all right?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.582
Talk to me.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.019
Let me in.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.556
Okay, well...

02:35.589 --> 02:38.025
they published
the eighth grade Hot List,

02:38.058 --> 02:40.294
and I came in at number 42.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.630
-Oh, that's not so bad.
-Out of 50.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.198
Oh. That stings.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.899
God, you know, when I was a kid,

02:45.933 --> 02:48.336
they used to tack that thing
to the bulletin board.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.703
I was always top five.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.372
One time I got strep throat,

02:51.405 --> 02:53.541
they had to send everyone home
on antibiotics.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.243
I don't get it.
I've tried everything.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.044
My hair is bigger
than it's ever been.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.812
I paid for everyone's lunches
last week.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.014
I spent a fortune
on this belt buckle.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.717
I figured this handspring
would really turn things around.

03:03.751 --> 03:06.654
Give me 200 bucks--
I'll fix your problem.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.989
You can get me to number one?

03:09.022 --> 03:11.058
Yeah. Well, I mean, right
after I cure genital herpes

03:11.091 --> 03:12.560
and fix the racial divide
in America.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.662
No, I am not
a miracle worker, Chip.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.897
But I can get you in the top 20.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.433
Okay, fine.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.134
What do I got to do?

03:22.202 --> 03:23.937
You get some beauty sleep

03:23.971 --> 03:26.507
and enjoy your final night
of being uncool.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.443
YOUNG WOMAN: "I got up from
the floor, and I took a walk.

03:29.477 --> 03:32.012
"As I reached
the top of the bridge,

03:32.045 --> 03:34.047
"my feet trembled.

03:34.081 --> 03:38.185
I realized
just how easily I could jump."

03:38.218 --> 03:40.288
-(scattered applause)
-Do it. Jump already.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.890
-Don't heckle the poets.
Got to keep a low profile. -Oh.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.759
I'm trying to assess
how big of a threat Mr. Reed is.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.961
MICKEY:
Oh, yep.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.897
There he is, surrounded
by all of his groupies.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.366
Ah, probably deciding
which one he wants...

03:52.400 --> 03:54.568
-to kill.
-I don't think poets

03:54.602 --> 03:56.203
are going around killing people.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.638
Yeah? What about Che Guevara?

03:57.671 --> 04:00.408
I don't know
what that means. Shh.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.610
"Wind passes.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.645
"The glowering sun emerges,

04:04.678 --> 04:07.147
and with it a new day."

04:07.180 --> 04:09.216
(sighs)

04:09.249 --> 04:10.618
I'm sorry.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.953
Just with all the pain
in the world...

04:12.986 --> 04:15.923
it feels more appropriate
to speak from the heart,

04:15.956 --> 04:18.058
-off the cuff.
-Ew, gross. -Yeah.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.828
When I close my eyes,

04:20.861 --> 04:23.931
I see our land in flames.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.400
And I ask myself,
who do we blame?

04:26.434 --> 04:28.436
Do we blame the old beggar

04:28.469 --> 04:30.003
with the crumbs in his beard?

04:30.037 --> 04:31.839
Or do you not see him?

04:31.872 --> 04:33.907
-Do you wish...
-Is he gonna say "disappear"?

04:33.941 --> 04:35.108
...he'd disappear?

04:35.142 --> 04:36.744
-Get out of here.
-Wha...?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.979
-Did you know that one?
-What the hell was that? No.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.448
It wasn't...
that wasn't off the cuff.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.883
-It rhymed. It was a poem.
-(gasps quietly)

04:45.118 --> 04:47.087
(gasps)
Did he just tickle her?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.122
He definitely did
just tickle her.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.091
-We caught a predator.
I'm gonna go give Dr. Seuss

04:51.124 --> 04:52.493
-a piece of my mind.
-All right.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.994
Well, I'm gonna hang back.
Oh, hey.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.529
Do you think they got hash here?

04:55.563 --> 04:56.697
What, like, on the menu?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.499
-Yeah.
-No.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.268
You know, it's cool.
I'm gonna ask anyway. Yeah.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.636
Psst.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.509
(crickets chirping)

05:10.344 --> 05:12.212
-Ow! Aah...
-JIMMY: Oh, yeah!

05:12.245 --> 05:14.214
That's gonna shine up real nice.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.783
Wha...?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.818
The hell is the matter with you,
you frickin' idiots!

05:17.851 --> 05:19.520
Okay, you know what,
you want to complain,

05:19.553 --> 05:21.389
or you want to hear the plan?
That bruise

05:21.422 --> 05:24.291
-is your ticket to climbing
The Hot List. -How?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.159
Aw, Chip.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.496
I look at you
and I see nothing.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.130
You're not smart.
You're not funny.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.634
You look like a jackass.
Okay? You got no hook.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.336
That black eye's gonna give you
some much-needed mystique.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.971
Do I have mystique?

05:38.005 --> 05:39.306
An assload of it.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.674
Now, pay attention.
When you go to school

05:40.708 --> 05:42.309
people are gonna ask you
what happened.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.311
You keep it vague.
You say, "Don't worry about it."

05:44.344 --> 05:46.414
You let the rumor mill
do the work.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.348
Whatever they cook up
is gonna be far sexier

05:48.382 --> 05:51.151
than the fact you got your
ass kicked by a ten-year-old.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.687
-I'm seven.
-I rest my case.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.689
Guess it's worth a shot.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.324
Yeah. But first we're gonna need

05:57.357 --> 05:59.393
to make that bruise
a little deeper.

05:59.427 --> 06:02.029
Ben.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.197
Due cappuccino. Enjoy.

06:04.231 --> 06:08.436
-So, you like underage girls,
is that right? -Excuse me?

06:08.469 --> 06:10.738
Oh, your little cheering section
over there. You like 'em young?

06:10.771 --> 06:12.239
Oh. My students.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.074
To be honest,
I think they're only here

06:14.107 --> 06:15.609
'cause I offered them
extra credit.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.244
Oh, I bet you did.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.847
What do you offer them next,
a little red wine?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.682
Some aged cheeses?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.350
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.953
Let me see if you can
follow this, Mr. Tambourine Man.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.021
I see you.
I see right through you.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.790
-So if you think that...
-I'm sorry to interrupt,

06:29.823 --> 06:33.861
but can you just tilt your head
that way, just a little bit?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.429
Why?

06:35.463 --> 06:37.531
The way the light
is bouncing off your hair,

06:37.565 --> 06:39.132
it looks really cool.

06:40.668 --> 06:44.404
Well, I just got highlights.
(nervous chuckle)

06:44.438 --> 06:46.106
I'm Brian.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.641
Yeah.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.147
-Oh, hey, where'd you go
last night? -Yeah,

06:54.181 --> 06:55.415
it's kind of a long story.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.117
(chuckles):
Yeah. Tell me about it.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.119
They didn't sell hash
at that place,

06:59.152 --> 07:01.489
but I got to talking
to some of those poets,

07:01.522 --> 07:04.091
and they had hash,
so we smoked up in their van,

07:04.124 --> 07:05.626
and we got so faded.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.227
(laughs):
Oh, it's good.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.395
-That's really great.
-Mm.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.830
Yeah. Oh. What about you?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.565
Did you confront
Sabrina's teacher?

07:11.599 --> 07:13.233
Yeah, yeah. Kind of.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.768
And then I banged him.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.838
-What? -Yeah. Now, look,
before you say anything,

07:17.871 --> 07:20.273
-it's actually a pretty smart
parenting move, right? -Mm.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.242
She's not gonna want to go
anywhere near that guy,

07:22.275 --> 07:25.579
'cause I poisoned the well--
'cause I'm the champ.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.948
-Mm.
-You don't follow the champ.

07:27.981 --> 07:31.451
So... you had sex
with Sabrina's crush...

07:31.485 --> 07:33.521
-for Sabrina?
-Mm-hmm.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.489
She better thank me for it, too,
'cause it was not good.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.424
-Oh.
-Lot of ear stuff.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.126
What happened to you?

07:39.159 --> 07:41.161
Lose your keys and have to sleep
in the yard again?

07:41.194 --> 07:43.931
Nope. Actually,
I was with a man.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.365
Oh. Good for you.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.934
Did he have a nice tent?

07:46.967 --> 07:49.002
-Okay. I go do something else.
-(Mickey chuckles)

07:49.036 --> 07:51.038
Nope. No tent.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.107
Uh, just a crappy little
studio apartment.

07:54.141 --> 07:58.011
Actually, think you might know
this man: Mr. Brian Reed.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.813
(laughs)
Yeah, right.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.549
I'm sorry?

08:01.582 --> 08:04.151
(laughing):
Are you... Are you serious?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.720
Oh, my God, Mickey,
he's way out of your league.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.822
(scoffs)
Clearly not.

08:08.856 --> 08:12.059
Mr. Reed prefers smart,
interesting women. Like me.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.894
Oh, believe you me, I had him.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.296
-I plowed him. Plowed him good.
-Mm-hmm.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.533
And I wouldn't be surprised
if he needs to take a sick day.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.501
Oh, God, what do you have?

08:21.535 --> 08:23.637
Nothing. No, not me.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.739
I'm not gross or sick.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.641
-I-I exhausted him...
-Mm-hmm.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.309
with sex.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.878
Mickey, it is one thing
to lie about hooking up

08:30.911 --> 08:32.713
with your teacher
when you were in high school,

08:32.746 --> 08:35.382
-but to do it when you're 50
is just sad. -No, no, no.

08:35.415 --> 08:36.984
Don't do that to me. No, I...

08:37.017 --> 08:38.586
First of all,
I'm not anywhere near fi...

08:38.619 --> 08:40.053
It... That doesn't matter.
I had them.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.555
I had both of them, all right.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.923
I had Mr. Reed, I had Winston.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.257
-I had both of them.
-Okay.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.326
-It's not a lie.
-I'm sorry.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.428
-I'm not lying. I didn't lie
then. Thank you. -I'm sorry.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.363
I don't mean to be rude, okay?
I just...

08:50.397 --> 08:52.365
I can't picture Mr. Reed
slumming it

08:52.399 --> 08:54.234
with some leather-skinned
drifter.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.436
How is that not rude?

08:56.469 --> 08:58.038
'Cause it's accurate.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.040
You know what?

09:00.073 --> 09:02.109
(laughing):
This is fine.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.444
It's no big deal. I'll just have
to prove it to you.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.813
I look forward to that.

09:09.783 --> 09:13.020
Hey, man.
What happened to your eye?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.755
It's nothing,
don't worry about it.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.356
Whatever,
he probably got beat up

09:16.389 --> 09:18.258
by his fine-ass sister.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.060
A-All right, all right.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.029
I-I-I'll tell you
what happened.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.032
I was chillin' down
at Marucci's Pizza,

09:25.065 --> 09:27.868
and I was in line for a slice
when these three goons

09:27.901 --> 09:31.404
from South Greenwich
cut me in line, so normally,

09:31.438 --> 09:33.306
I'm a helluva laid back guy.
Okay, but there's only one slice

09:33.340 --> 09:35.142
of 'roni left, and 'roni...

09:35.175 --> 09:36.877
that's my favorite topping.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.713
So I tell the guy, I was like,
"Yo, there's a line."

09:39.747 --> 09:41.982
And he goes, "Oh. You want to do
something about it?"

09:42.015 --> 09:44.084
And I was like, "Yeah.
I thought you'd never ask."

09:44.117 --> 09:46.954
Long story short, he pops me in
the eye, I don't feel a thing.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.256
So I say to the guy behind the
counter, I was like, "Yo, bro,

09:49.289 --> 09:51.258
"let me get that last slice
of pepperoni pizza to go.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.226
My friend here
will take a body bag."

09:53.260 --> 09:55.763
-Wham!
-Whoa.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.564
Roundhouse kick
right to the face.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.166
You're gnarly for real, bro.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.068
Yeah. I didn't stick around
long enough to see

10:01.101 --> 10:03.270
if he actually died,
but I haven't heard anything,

10:03.303 --> 10:04.972
so I guess I'm good.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.074
Damn. I-I didn't know
you were into beating ass.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.742
There's a lot of stuff people
don't know about me.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.011
I'm mad mysterious.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.782
-STUDENT: Whoa.
-(indistinct talking)

10:15.615 --> 10:17.918
Inhale. (inhales)

10:17.951 --> 10:20.187
Take all the thoughts
in your mind,

10:20.220 --> 10:22.355
place them
in an imaginary backpack.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.624
Or messenger bag,
if you prefer.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.694
Now, take the bag
of your choice,

10:26.727 --> 10:28.662
and embrace its weight.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.530
-I've got something you can
embrace. -(gasps) Hey, hi.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.199
What are you,
what are you doing here?

10:32.232 --> 10:34.634
-Just came to see my boo. Hi.
-Hi. Hi.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.369
-Miss us. Oh. -(gasps)
No, don't-don't do that.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.205
-Uh, you need to leave. This is
very inappropriate. -Mmm.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.708
Oh, yeah, will do, magic man.
No, just real quick,

10:40.741 --> 10:43.643
I just wa... H-H-H-Hold on a
second, where-where's Sabrina?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.212
I thought she was in this class.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.015
-Sabrina Pemberton? You know
her? -Yeah, I'm her aunt.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.850
I really wanted her to hear
this next part, though.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.518
-Can I talk to you outside?
Thanks. -Uh-huh.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.053
Could've sworn that
she would've been in there.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.488
Well, hey, do you know
where she is? 'Cause maybe

10:55.522 --> 10:57.290
you could walk me to the class?
Is that dumb?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.059
That's crazy. I'm sorry,
that's crazy. (laughs)

10:59.092 --> 11:01.862
Oh... Come over
for dinner tonight.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.364
Yes. She'll be there, that's
where she can see us together.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.700
Okay, what do you like to eat?
You like, uh, pizza?

11:06.734 --> 11:10.003
No. Look, last night...
was a mistake.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.638
Okay, well, hold on.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.373
I know that.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.843
A mistake, are you kidding me?
I was gonna tell you that.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.544
Look, if I'd known that you were
a parent at this school,

11:17.577 --> 11:19.246
I would have never
slept with you.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.048
Well, that's rich
coming from a man

11:21.081 --> 11:23.483
-with a harem of young girls.
-I have to go.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.985
-(school bell rings) -All right.
Well, h-hold on a second.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.086
Hey.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.354
Do the right thing.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.588
(indistinct chatter nearby)

11:28.621 --> 11:30.557
JIMMY:
Yo. There's the man.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.059
How'd I do?

11:32.092 --> 11:33.727
Uh, frickin' amazing.

11:33.761 --> 11:36.096
-Yeah. Still got it.
-Ben, I want to thank you.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.766
This black eye is the greatest
gift I've ever been given.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.868
-Really?
-Big time.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.070
You're looking at the second
hottest dude in eighth grade.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.905
Wow.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.540
It works.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.177
Hey. Second?

11:50.210 --> 11:51.912
As in number two?

11:51.945 --> 11:53.914
Believe it.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.715
Okay, the only way you go
from 42 to two

11:55.749 --> 11:58.551
is if some guy goes in there
and mows down 40 other kids.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.353
What'd you do?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.122
Nothing. Some kid
was dogging on me,

12:02.155 --> 12:03.891
so I told him I tuned up some
public school kids. (laughs)

12:03.924 --> 12:06.693
Oh, my God, you fool.
I told you to keep it vague.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.428
Sorry if I took your advice
and made it

12:08.461 --> 12:10.297
-a frick-ton better.
-Nah, you don't get it, man.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.299
Now you're a fighter,
and that's very specific.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.367
You're gonna walk around
with a target on your back.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.270
Yeah? Well, heavy lies
the crown.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.473
(grunts)

12:20.507 --> 12:21.809
G-Give me ba-back my b-binder.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.443
"B-B-Binder."

12:23.476 --> 12:25.078
What? I can't understand you.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.379
Speak English.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.182
Can I help you?

12:31.584 --> 12:34.421
-(sighs)
-KIDS: Whoa.

12:34.454 --> 12:35.856
You're welcome.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.659
* My mind is soft *

12:39.692 --> 12:41.394
-Ow.
-* I never owe *

12:41.428 --> 12:43.296
* Nobody else *

12:43.330 --> 12:44.832
* I never owe nobody else *

12:44.865 --> 12:46.599
There you go.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.801
* But you *

12:48.668 --> 12:50.670
*

12:50.703 --> 12:52.840
* My mind is soft *

12:56.043 --> 13:00.680
-(grunts)
-* I never owe nobody else *

13:00.713 --> 13:02.850
* I never owe nobody else *

13:04.952 --> 13:08.621
-* Do you want come my way? *
-(grunts)

13:08.655 --> 13:10.790
* Did you want to come
and miss my mind here? *

13:10.824 --> 13:14.627
* Do you want to come and miss
my mind here? *

13:14.661 --> 13:15.695
(grunts)

13:15.728 --> 13:17.664
BEN:
You'll thank me later.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.299
(door closes)

13:19.332 --> 13:21.468
What is wrong with you?
Are you insane?

13:21.501 --> 13:23.837
Oh. I guess Brian informed you

13:23.871 --> 13:26.339
about our little
poetry slam sesh?

13:26.373 --> 13:28.541
My friends told me that you
stormed into his classroom

13:28.575 --> 13:31.444
-like a lunatic. -Wait, but he
didn't say anything?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.480
No, of course not,
because nothing happened.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.182
Okay, now I'm pissed off.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.716
I feel like I'm back
in the janitor's closet,

13:36.749 --> 13:39.786
and everyone's...
Sabrina, I am not lying.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.655
Sabrina, shame on you, okay?

13:42.689 --> 13:44.691
Women need to believe
each other.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.160
I know that when I hooked up
with Edward Olmos, Jr....

13:47.194 --> 13:49.362
It's Edward James Olmos.
I-It-It-- That doesn't matter.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.031
It didn't happen.
Stop saying that.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.732
Well, looked just like him.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.235
So just some old man with
bad skin? My thing happened.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.804
Just stay away from Brian, okay?
He's mine.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.472
(laughing):
Oh.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.208
Okay. Okay.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.210
So this guy wants it to look
like I'm crazy.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.812
Sure, no problem.
I do a great crazy.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.847
(tires squealing)

14:15.288 --> 14:16.856
It's Mickey!

14:16.890 --> 14:18.725
Can we talk for just a sec?

14:20.427 --> 14:21.761
H-Hey!

14:21.794 --> 14:23.330
I saw that.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.998
Open this door, right now.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.000
(door closing)

14:27.034 --> 14:31.004
(gasps) Oh, you think
you can hide from me?

14:31.038 --> 14:33.941
Well, I've got news for you:
you can't.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.708
And-And one more piece of news:

14:35.742 --> 14:37.945
I will hunt you down!

14:37.978 --> 14:39.346
Ma'am, I don't think he's home.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.014
Oh, he's home.
He is home.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.515
I am not crazy!

14:42.549 --> 14:44.517
I can give him
a message for you.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.853
I'll give him a message.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.888
*

14:51.992 --> 14:53.760
(tires squealing)

15:05.472 --> 15:08.308
There you are, bro. I've been
looking everywhere for you.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.977
Oh, yeah?
Well, I've been in the gym.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.311
Getting swole.
(chuckles)

15:11.344 --> 15:12.412
We got to roll. Now.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.913
-Where we going?
-Parking lot.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.482
Some dudes from South Greenwich
heard you were talking smack.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.883
They want to fight you.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.420
Th-They want to fight me?
How many are there?

15:20.453 --> 15:21.989
I don't know, like six.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.757
You can handle that,
though, right?

15:24.791 --> 15:26.326
Y-Yeah. (scoffs)

15:26.359 --> 15:27.660
T-Totally. Six?

15:27.694 --> 15:29.896
Wish there were seven.
I have this thing

15:29.929 --> 15:31.999
where I have to beat people
in odd numbers, so...

15:32.032 --> 15:34.034
Let's go.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.104
You wanted to... Ugh.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.072
Uh, Mr. Reed,
please have a seat.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.108
(sighs)

15:41.141 --> 15:42.809
Look, I don't know
what she told you...

15:42.842 --> 15:44.344
He said have a seat, Brian.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.281
Ms. Molng here
has just been sharing some

15:48.315 --> 15:50.417
troubling accusations.

15:50.450 --> 15:54.254
Uh, she claims
that you engaged in...

15:54.287 --> 15:57.357
That there was a...

15:57.390 --> 15:58.825
Sex.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.293
"Sex" is the word
you're looking for.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.928
Plus all the dirty
lead-up stuff.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.763
-He does this thing with your
ears. It's... -Tha-That's...

16:03.796 --> 16:05.865
I-I don't need details.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.834
It just goes on for too long.
That's all I was gonna say.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.669
Mr. Reed, is this true?

16:09.702 --> 16:12.639
Did you engage
in a sexual relationship

16:12.672 --> 16:14.974
with Ms. Molng?

16:17.244 --> 16:18.545
-Yes.
-(grunts)

16:18.578 --> 16:20.047
I mean, technically it's true.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.649
Finally.
Finally, he admits it.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.718
-This is so embarrassing.
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.488
Do not do that. I am the one
who is embarrassed, all right?

16:28.521 --> 16:29.956
Ashamed, even.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.359
Obviously,
this is a problem, Brian.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.361
Well, I didn't know who she was.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.129
I was at my other job,
she approached me,

16:36.163 --> 16:38.198
we started talking,
it just happened.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.900
Wait, you didn't know
she was a Lockwood parent?

16:40.933 --> 16:42.302
No, of course not.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.072
And none of this happened
on school property?

16:45.105 --> 16:47.074
No, she targeted me at work.

16:47.107 --> 16:50.577
Wha... Well, I'm not sure
that any of this is illegal.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.712
Okay, I'll give you that.
That-that... that, technically,

16:52.745 --> 16:55.915
that was all by the book.
But this man is a predator.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.385
-Wh...?
-And also, he will not admit

16:58.418 --> 17:00.320
to Sabrina that we had sex.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.322
Uh, nor should he.
I-I'm on his side there.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.023
You know what?
In fact, Brian,

17:04.057 --> 17:06.526
-you are free to go.
-Thank you. -What?!

17:06.559 --> 17:09.596
Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.
Course he's free to go.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.264
'Cause this whole
education system is just

17:11.298 --> 17:13.032
-one big boys club, isn't it?
-Well, actually,

17:13.066 --> 17:16.269
76% of teachers in America
are female, so you're...

17:16.303 --> 17:18.571
Oh, thank you for mansplaining
that for me, Gibbons.

17:18.605 --> 17:21.408
Guess what? I will not
be bullied into silence.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.110
You know, uh,
speaking of bullying,

17:23.143 --> 17:25.445
we need to have
a small chat about Ben.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.747
He has been physically
assaulting students

17:27.780 --> 17:30.183
that he has deemed...

17:30.217 --> 17:31.684
"losers."

17:31.718 --> 17:32.919
Doesn't sound like my Ben.

17:32.952 --> 17:34.121
Well, maybe
you don't know your Ben

17:34.154 --> 17:35.555
as well as you think you do.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.024
The good news is that
he wants to make it right,

17:38.057 --> 17:40.793
so he has volunteered to read
an anti-bullying poem

17:40.827 --> 17:43.029
in our school's Arts Fest.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.765
Great. Perfect punishment.
Poems suck.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.800
-(gentle music playing)
-(boys snickering)

17:50.069 --> 17:51.471
'Sup, 48?

17:51.504 --> 17:53.873
Hey, nice belt buckle.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.408
All right, screw this.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.743
(applause)

17:56.776 --> 17:58.378
GIBBONS:
Thank you, thank you, girls.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.247
Thank you so very much.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.614
(chuckles)

18:01.648 --> 18:05.051
Up next, we have
one of our youngest poets,

18:05.084 --> 18:06.986
Ben Pemberton, who will be

18:07.019 --> 18:10.923
reciting a poem
about the dangers of bullying.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.959
(scattered applause)

18:15.094 --> 18:18.398
"Black Eyes" by Ben Pemberton.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.334
"Black eyes are cool,
black eyes rule,

18:21.368 --> 18:23.670
"but black eyes
don't belong at our school.

18:23.703 --> 18:27.106
"Black eyes look scary,
but black eyes are fun.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.908
I really wish
that I could have one."

18:28.941 --> 18:31.444
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Ben. Thank you.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.347
For your poem
on-on why black eyes

18:34.381 --> 18:37.116
are bad.
Black eyes was the...

18:37.150 --> 18:38.451
(clears throat)

18:38.485 --> 18:41.988
Next up, uh,
Ben's older sister, Sabrina.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.156
(scattered applause)

18:43.190 --> 18:45.825
Thank you for helping me
recognize my gift.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.660
I wrote this for you.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.262
Oh, uh... thank you.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.797
Good luck.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.368
(clears throat)

18:55.402 --> 18:59.038
"Baggage" by Sabrina Pemberton.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.274
"I am a handbag.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.176
"Empty. Expensive.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.178
"Carried places
I don't want to go.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.113
"But then you came,

19:07.146 --> 19:08.615
"and rifled through my pockets

19:08.648 --> 19:10.483
"like a gentle thief.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.052
"Now I'm ready.
Unzip me.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.854
Place things inside me."

19:14.887 --> 19:16.523
I had sex with Mr. Reed.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.191
Ah, nah.
That's right.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.559
This creep
not only teaches girls

19:19.592 --> 19:21.228
how to write terrible poetry,

19:21.261 --> 19:23.730
he also lies to their faces
about sleeping with their aunt.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.865
But I got the receipts.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.534
I will hunt you down!

19:27.567 --> 19:29.236
-WOMAN: I don't think he's home.
-Whoops, hold on. One...

19:29.269 --> 19:30.703
Give me one sec.
That's, uh, wrong part.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.839
MICKEY:
He is home. I am not crazy!

19:32.872 --> 19:34.541
Well... (chuckles)
He was home

19:34.574 --> 19:36.008
throughout this entire
exchange, mind you.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.477
-Okay, the... No, no, they...
-No, no, no, I'm...

19:37.510 --> 19:40.179
-That's good enough. I think...
-Hey, hey, hey! Stop. Hey. Stop.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.648
I'll be done in a second.
Just give me...

19:41.681 --> 19:42.915
You guys just hang in there
for one...

19:42.949 --> 19:44.751
It's right here.
It's right here.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.486
GIBBONS:
Mr. Reed, did you engage

19:46.519 --> 19:49.756
in a sexual relationship
with Ms. Molng?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.558
REED:
Yes.

19:51.591 --> 19:54.261
-(crowd gasps)
-Yes. Yes.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.096
Are you serious?
You actually slept with her?

19:57.129 --> 19:59.866
I thought you were just waiting
till I graduated to make a move.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.268
We had something.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.603
I just wanted
to teach you some poetry.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.738
-Ugh.
-If there are any other victims,

20:05.772 --> 20:07.774
please come forward
and hold hands.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.243
-We are stronger together.
-No...

20:14.781 --> 20:16.783
(scattered gasps, chuckling)

20:20.219 --> 20:21.921
CHIP:
Oh, no, no, no.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.890
I didn't-I didn't
sleep with that guy. No.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.926
The... the handspring
is separate from that.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.766
49? That makes no sense.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.935
Makes perfect sense.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.871
Even Aaron Luber is higher
than me, and he eats bugs.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.573
Okay, how do I explain this
to you?

20:40.607 --> 20:42.275
Doing a handspring
in the Olympics,

20:42.309 --> 20:44.477
or to escape danger, is cool.

20:44.511 --> 20:48.147
But just doing it out of
nowhere, unannounced? Not cool.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.116
But I stuck the landing
perfectly.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.584
Yeah, that's
the worst part, man.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.720
Maybe if you'd biffed the
landing and eaten your teeth,

20:53.753 --> 20:55.655
it'd be funny.
But instead you did it

20:55.688 --> 20:58.458
with perfect precision?
That's weird.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.992
I don't get it.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.494
Yeah, you probably never will.

21:01.528 --> 21:04.464
Maybe if you write a poem
it will make you cool again.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.065
I wouldn't recommend it.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.167
Yeah, poetry's not in our blood.
I see that now.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.469
Plus, there's
no real future in it.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.070
Wha... I thought
Mr. Reed said...

21:11.103 --> 21:13.172
Mr. Reed's an idiot. His
credibility went out the window

21:13.205 --> 21:15.608
-the second I realized he wasn't
trying to bang me. -Mm.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.344
Plus, he resigned.
I'm not gonna take advice

21:17.377 --> 21:19.346
from some coffee jockey.

21:19.379 --> 21:22.081
Boom. Read it and weep.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.950
According to this
restraining order,

21:23.983 --> 21:26.586
I can't come within
a thousand yards of Mr. Reed

21:26.619 --> 21:29.689
because of emotional distress
due to, and I quote,

21:29.722 --> 21:33.460
"deeply regrettable sexual
intercourse." Huh?

21:33.493 --> 21:36.829
It's on the record, okay?
So who's crazy now?

21:36.863 --> 21:38.164
(Jimmy chuckles)

21:38.197 --> 21:41.000
Way to go, Mick.
That's my girl.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.835
Wait, what?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.805
SABRINA: Unzip me.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.340

Media Access Group at WGBH

21:50.309 --> 21:52.278
Hope you
enjoyed
kickin' it
with The Mick.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.547
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:57.684 --> 22:00.319
