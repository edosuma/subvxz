12:16.336 --> 12:17.435
                 because I gotta
                     take Ma    

12:17.437 --> 12:19.036
        to see the surgeon today
            at the hospital.    

12:19.038 --> 12:20.170
Yeah, yeah,                     
look at this.                   

12:20.172 --> 12:22.506
This makes me mad enough        
to want to hit somebody.        

12:22.508 --> 12:25.810
The government is spending      
$950 million on the <i>Nimitz.</i>     

12:25.812 --> 12:27.244
              What's the <i>Nimitz?</i>

12:27.246 --> 12:28.912
It's a new aircraft carrier.    

12:28.914 --> 12:30.414
Nine hundred and fifty million! 

12:30.416 --> 12:31.749
That's over twice as much       

12:31.751 --> 12:33.951
as the country spends on        
cancer research in a whole year!

12:33.953 --> 12:35.953
On a carrier! I don't           
believe it! Look at this!       

12:35.955 --> 12:38.389
                Michael, shh!   
Oh, yeah, sorry.                

12:38.391 --> 12:39.423
                    A carrier?  

12:39.425 --> 12:42.192
              Who's the carrier?

12:42.194 --> 12:45.663
     Typhoid Meathead over here?

12:45.665 --> 12:46.897
          What's all this about?

12:46.899 --> 12:50.300
    Everybody up, 7:30, so early
    on a Saturday morning?      

12:50.302 --> 12:52.035
Well, we're just talking.       

12:52.037 --> 12:55.305
    Oh, don't give me that.     
     There's something going on.

12:55.307 --> 12:56.540
         What I mean to say,    

12:56.542 --> 12:59.943
        there's something rotten
        in the state of Denver. 

12:59.945 --> 13:01.945
                Daddy, nothing's
                    going on.   

13:01.947 --> 13:04.114
        Well, how come that     
         Meathead clams up      

13:04.116 --> 13:05.249
    every time I come close?    

13:05.251 --> 13:06.617
      That ain't natural.       

13:06.619 --> 13:08.085
I was just thinking.            

13:08.087 --> 13:10.087
  That ain't natural neither.   

13:11.656 --> 13:12.723
Where's the coffee, little girl?

13:12.725 --> 13:14.124
             Oh, I'll get       
             it for you.        

13:14.126 --> 13:16.093
                    Hurry up,   
                    hurry up.   

13:16.095 --> 13:17.762
                Daddy's up.     
                He wants coffee.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.963
            How is Archie       
                 taking it?     

13:19.965 --> 13:21.799
Oh, he don't know.              

13:21.801 --> 13:23.634
                He doesn't know?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.235
GLORIA:                         
No, he doesn't.                 

13:25.237 --> 13:28.439
            But he's getting    
             awfully suspicious.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.973
                 I don't get it,
                      Edith.    

13:29.975 --> 13:32.910
      You didn't tell Archie,   
but you told Mike and Gloria?   

13:32.912 --> 13:34.779
Well, I had to tell them        

13:34.781 --> 13:37.748
so they'd know                  
what not to tell Archie.        

13:40.251 --> 13:43.788
     Maybe you ought to iron    
  the other sleeve for a change.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.056
     Oh, yeah.                  

13:46.058 --> 13:50.828
Irene, I ain't talked           
about this to Gloria            

13:50.830 --> 13:52.663
because I didn't                
want to worry her,              

13:52.665 --> 13:57.167
but suppose I have to have      
one of them operations.         

13:57.169 --> 13:59.937
         Oh, look, it's probably
        just a little cyst.     

13:59.939 --> 14:01.539
    That's all it usually is.   

14:01.541 --> 14:04.207
But what if                     
this time it ain't?             

14:04.209 --> 14:06.410
        Then have the operation.

14:06.412 --> 14:08.446
        It's a great way        
          to save your life.    

14:10.181 --> 14:11.949
                There's one big 
            drawback, though.   

14:11.951 --> 14:13.417
     What's that?               

14:13.419 --> 14:14.852
             You get well       
        and you have to         

14:14.854 --> 14:17.621
          keep cooking          
    and ironing for Archie.     

14:17.623 --> 14:20.190
    Oh! Oh, Irene!              

14:20.192 --> 14:21.892
     That's better now, you see.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.694
Dummy up!                       

14:32.203 --> 14:34.338
              What is this, huh?

14:34.340 --> 14:37.808
  Every time I come near people,
          they shut up,         

14:37.810 --> 14:42.279
         like I was the Spanish 
    Inquisition or something.   

14:42.281 --> 14:44.815
Just a little                   
girl talk, Archie.              

14:44.817 --> 14:46.817
          What are you doing    
      over here so early, Irene?

14:46.819 --> 14:49.753
         Did you have a fight   
     with the Italian lover boy?

14:49.755 --> 14:54.758
No. Edith and I are holding     
a secret Tupperware party.      

14:54.760 --> 14:57.160
  Yeah, well, secret's the word,

14:57.162 --> 14:59.864
          because I think that  
    something very suspicious   

14:59.866 --> 15:01.699
              is being cooked up
                 around here.   

15:01.701 --> 15:03.133
        Oh, there's not!        

15:03.135 --> 15:06.436
  I was just telling Edith about
my sister getting pregnant.     

15:06.438 --> 15:08.772
Who, the nun?                   

15:11.676 --> 15:13.477
                    Not her,    
                my other sister.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.212
Really, Irene?                  

15:15.214 --> 15:18.148
     Yeah, and after she swore  
she'd never have another baby   

15:18.150 --> 15:20.784
  after all the trouble she went
    through with the first one. 

15:20.786 --> 15:24.722
        And you know, Edith,    
         she was in heavy labor.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.824
                  Fifteen hours!
        Arggh.                  

15:26.826 --> 15:29.326
    And then they thought       
it was going to be a breech--   

15:29.328 --> 15:32.162
     Irene! Mixed company,      
          Irene, huh!           

15:32.164 --> 15:35.165
     Mixed company, really!     

15:35.167 --> 15:37.768
     Can't you be delicate?     

15:37.770 --> 15:41.171
  Oh, thank you!                

15:41.173 --> 15:45.108
     Irene, can I               
  ask you something?            

15:45.110 --> 15:46.176
                 Of course.     

15:46.178 --> 15:48.311
    Sit down.                   

15:51.349 --> 15:54.919
    When Archie and me          
was first going together,       

15:54.921 --> 15:57.588
we used to go out dancing a lot.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.756
             And--              

15:58.758 --> 16:02.760
    Oh, I ain't never           
    told no one this before,    

16:02.762 --> 16:08.766
but while we was dancing,       
 Archie used to sing in my ear. 

16:08.768 --> 16:10.634
            Archie?             

16:10.636 --> 16:11.702
             Yeah.              

16:11.704 --> 16:14.104
And his favorite song was:      

16:14.106 --> 16:15.873
      ♪ You're the tops ♪       

16:15.875 --> 16:17.474
  ♪ You're the Tower of Pisa ♪  

16:17.476 --> 16:19.342
      ♪ You're the tops ♪       

16:19.344 --> 16:23.080
    ♪ You're the smile          
    On the <i>Mona Lisa ♪</i>          

16:23.082 --> 16:24.882
        And all evening         

16:24.884 --> 16:28.852
    I would go around           
trying to smile for Archie      

16:28.854 --> 16:30.120
      like the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>       

16:30.122 --> 16:31.989
        You know--              

16:36.995 --> 16:38.395
                        IRENE:  
                      Oh, Edith!

16:40.799 --> 16:43.767
          What was it           
     you wanted to ask me?      

16:47.405 --> 16:50.975
        I'm afraid              
if I have this operation,       

16:50.977 --> 16:55.045
    Archie won't think of me    
        in the same way.        

16:55.047 --> 16:58.281
                Oh, Edith,      
          stop scaring yourself.

16:58.283 --> 17:01.619
        Archie loves you,       
and nothing's gonna change that.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.954
But I'm gonna change a lot.     

17:04.957 --> 17:07.858
         Yes, and even if you   
     have to have the operation,

17:07.859 --> 17:09.893
  it's still gonna be all right.

17:09.895 --> 17:11.361
          Believe me.           

17:11.363 --> 17:12.930
You don't know.                 

17:14.397 --> 17:17.101
          That's just the point,
            Edith. I do know.   

17:17.103 --> 17:19.103
                     <i>I</i> know.    

17:22.773 --> 17:25.474
You mean, you--?                

17:25.477 --> 17:26.844
              Six years ago.    

17:26.846 --> 17:29.613
            And you see how     
         Frank and I get along. 

17:29.615 --> 17:32.016
      It hasn't made one bit    
  of difference in our marriage.

17:33.885 --> 17:36.286
        Don't bother looking,   
                Edith.          

17:39.524 --> 17:41.591
    I-I wasn't.                 

17:44.595 --> 17:47.430
          You can't tell,       
and there's no use asking me.   

17:47.432 --> 17:50.367
Oh, no, I wouldn't              
think of asking.                

17:50.369 --> 17:53.704
I mean, I'd think of it,        
but I wouldn't ask.             

17:53.706 --> 17:55.105
      Oh, no!                   

17:56.274 --> 18:01.211
Oh, Irene! You made me          
feel so much better!            

18:01.213 --> 18:03.446
                Oh, darling!    

18:05.349 --> 18:07.685
         I don't believe it.    
     Will you look at this here?

18:07.687 --> 18:09.119
     More Christmas cards!      

18:09.121 --> 18:12.455
Why doesn't everybody just      
get together and yell, "Enough"?

18:12.457 --> 18:15.125
              What is the matter
            with you today?     

18:15.127 --> 18:16.459
  Nothing.                      

18:16.461 --> 18:18.696
            Jeez, you're even   
         knocking Christmas now.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.865
I'm not knocking Christmas,     
I'm knocking Christmas cards.   

18:21.867 --> 18:25.235
        Ah, you'd knock anything
        that wasn't food.       

18:25.237 --> 18:28.806
Archie, it's a total waste      
of money and paper.             

18:28.808 --> 18:31.241
     What are you talking about?

18:31.243 --> 18:32.576
             It ain't the money,

18:32.578 --> 18:34.845
     it's the beautiful thoughts
         behind them things.    

18:34.847 --> 18:36.780
Oh, yeah, you mean              
like this one.                  

18:36.782 --> 18:38.916
"Merry Christmas                
and a Happy New Year            

18:38.918 --> 18:41.051
to all you folks                
we hold so dear."               

18:41.053 --> 18:43.687
              All right,        
     that's a beautiful thought.

18:43.689 --> 18:46.056
    "So call us first           
when your pipes are burst.      

18:46.058 --> 18:48.058
    Paragon Plumbers."          

18:51.129 --> 18:52.963
             Get out of here,   
          you're making that up.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.331
Right there, Archie!            
Right there!                    

18:54.333 --> 18:56.200
              Get away from me, 
                  will you?     

19:00.805 --> 19:03.006
             Hey, where's Edith?

19:03.008 --> 19:05.909
Uh, she went out                
with Gloria.                    

19:05.911 --> 19:09.046
         I know that, but where?
              For how long?     

19:09.048 --> 19:10.413
Well, what are you              
asking me for?

Did she mention anything to you

  pull the wolf over my eyes?   

20:04.837 --> 20:06.770
No, Archie, I didn't think that.

         Well, listen.

      Don't tip Edith off
