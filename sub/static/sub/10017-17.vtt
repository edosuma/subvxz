00:47.650 --> 00:49.239
She loves me.

00:50.281 --> 00:51.835
She loves me not.

00:53.411 --> 00:54.739
She loves me.

00:55.775 --> 00:56.797
She loves me not.

00:57.006 --> 00:59.834
I'm not a nurse-in-training,
I'm a nurse-in-decorating.

01:00.037 --> 01:01.933
Valentine's Day. Can I help?

01:02.135 --> 01:04.791
- Can't you just do it?
- Come on.

01:05.664 --> 01:06.822
ER.

01:09.626 --> 01:12.350
Carol, can you find Dr. Ross
for Mrs. Hall?

01:12.556 --> 01:13.578
Sure. Mrs?

01:13.788 --> 01:17.682
- Hall. Dr. Ross is the pediatrician?
- Yeah, what's the problem?

01:17.884 --> 01:21.244
- Tatiana, she's very sick.
- You don't feel well?

01:21.446 --> 01:24.705
She has a fever and a cough.
It just doesn't seem right.

01:24.909 --> 01:27.372
- Okay, come right this way.
- Thank you.

01:30.004 --> 01:32.059
Mark, it's 10:00.

01:32.269 --> 01:33.563
So?

01:33.933 --> 01:36.658
So you got in at 8, remember?
You weren't here overnight.

01:36.863 --> 01:40.155
I was taking a nap. Is there
anything wrong with taking a nap?

01:40.360 --> 01:41.790
Certainly not.

01:41.991 --> 01:46.215
Stomach ache in 2, bounce-back migraine
in 1. Can I give them an ETA?

01:52.480 --> 01:53.966
Does that tickle?

01:55.277 --> 01:57.796
- Temperature's 100.
- Does this hurt?

01:58.440 --> 02:00.597
She doesn't speak much English.

02:01.503 --> 02:02.933
She's Russian.

02:03.134 --> 02:05.291
I adopted her in St. Petersburg
10 days ago.

02:05.498 --> 02:08.949
- When did the fever start?
- I'd waited nearly six months.

02:09.162 --> 02:12.023
Finally, all her paperwork
was in order...

02:12.225 --> 02:14.212
...and medical certificates...

02:14.456 --> 02:15.852
She really seemed fine.

02:16.054 --> 02:19.346
- How long has she had the fever?
- Almost a week.

02:19.550 --> 02:21.571
Start her on some oral amoxicillin.

02:21.814 --> 02:24.800
She has some respiratory congestion
and an ear infection...

02:25.011 --> 02:28.995
...which is causing the fever. Don't
worry, we'll take good care of her.

02:29.207 --> 02:31.500
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.

02:33.502 --> 02:36.124
Wendy, it's nice of you to
volunteer to put those up.

02:36.332 --> 02:38.887
I didn't volunteer.

02:41.560 --> 02:42.785
Happy Valentine's Day!

02:42.991 --> 02:44.546
Thanks, Lydia.

02:44.756 --> 02:47.379
Here's another one for your stash.

02:47.586 --> 02:48.744
Thank you.

02:49.151 --> 02:50.672
Hello?

02:53.779 --> 02:55.834
Amy. Brooks.

02:56.044 --> 02:58.031
- Wendy. Patty.
- Come on.

02:58.241 --> 03:00.262
- Who are these women?
- I don't remember.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.061
- You're full of it.
- I don't remember meeting them.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.665
Police!
Help! Quick!

03:05.866 --> 03:09.317
I hit him. He dashed off
the sidewalk chasing a ball.

03:09.595 --> 03:11.889
I tried to swerve the car, but...

03:12.093 --> 03:14.057
- Please!
- I'll page Benton.

03:26.111 --> 03:29.903
Clear Trauma. 39-year-old male
fell from the second-story balcony...

03:30.074 --> 03:31.061
Watch yourself.

03:33.203 --> 03:34.667
Mrs. Hall?

03:37.798 --> 03:39.262
Mrs. Hall, wait.

03:40.695 --> 03:43.215
Jerry, let me know when
Mrs. Hall comes back.

03:43.426 --> 03:45.413
- Sure.
- Thanks.

03:47.322 --> 03:48.650
I tried to dodge him.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.976
- Scalp laceration.
- I can't hear a thing.

03:51.183 --> 03:52.943
He just came out of nowhere.

03:53.148 --> 03:55.805
He's got a fractured
left front radius?

03:57.144 --> 03:58.403
Where do you want the IV?

03:58.609 --> 04:01.333
- Please help him, okay, doc?
- Give me the bulletin.

04:01.539 --> 04:03.968
- Car versus canine.
- Car versus canine?

04:04.169 --> 04:06.689
Fractured left front leg.
Or maybe it's radius-ulna.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.262
Nobody's sure how to take the BP.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.894
A dog?
You called me down here for a dog?

04:11.096 --> 04:13.151
The vet's office is
sending someone over.

04:13.359 --> 04:15.085
- What do we do?
- I'll name him Bill.

04:15.291 --> 04:16.550
What are you, crazy?

04:16.755 --> 04:18.345
You don't like the name Bill?

04:18.553 --> 04:20.745
Call him whatever you want,
but do it fast...

04:20.951 --> 04:23.414
...because little Bill here
has stopped breathing.

05:13.128 --> 05:15.024
He's one of God's creatures.

05:15.226 --> 05:17.281
- I'm not a vet, Grabarsky.
- You could try.

05:17.490 --> 05:21.418
No. I'll be upstairs taking
a gallbladder out of a Homo sapien.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.904
- Did I miss anything?
- You were only gone ten seconds.

05:27.113 --> 05:29.270
Poor little guy.
No collar, no tags.

05:29.477 --> 05:33.269
- Must be lost, or a stray.
- I should've taken dog lab, not pig lab.

05:33.473 --> 05:35.403
Digestive system, abdomen...

05:35.603 --> 05:38.294
- Whoa, look at that spleen.
- Wow!

05:38.500 --> 05:41.225
- Can we hurry this up, please?
- IV goes in what vein?

05:41.430 --> 05:44.053
Try the large one.
Then give him some saline.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.815
Somebody find out
where the vet is.

05:45.993 --> 05:47.956
Okay, here it is. Intubation.

05:48.156 --> 05:50.711
It's like with a human,
but when pushing back the tongue...

05:51.120 --> 05:52.913
...you can see the vocal cords.

05:53.118 --> 05:55.240
- Thank you, Carter.
- Get an Ambu bag.

05:55.449 --> 05:56.708
Let's intubate.

06:00.377 --> 06:01.671
Pneumothorax, right there.

06:02.275 --> 06:03.932
- A what?
- Collapsed lung.

06:04.106 --> 06:05.093
Oh, my God!

06:05.304 --> 06:09.993
Lydia, get a 20-gauge needle on a
60cc syringe with a three-way stopcock.

06:10.199 --> 06:11.992
Which intercostal is it?

06:12.197 --> 06:15.160
- Try the eighth, just below the heart.
- All right.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.372
Bill lives.

06:31.243 --> 06:33.763
All we have to do is
sew up the lac...

06:33.973 --> 06:35.960
...and get a cast on him...

06:36.171 --> 06:38.657
...and he'll be chasing squirrels
by the afternoon.

06:38.868 --> 06:41.491
Carter, Chen.
I think you can take it from here.

06:41.698 --> 06:45.058
Somebody call housekeeping.
Tell them to get a hose.

06:45.560 --> 06:46.990
No problem.

06:47.192 --> 06:49.950
That was pretty cool,
the way you gave it mouth-to-mouth.

06:50.156 --> 06:51.450
Thank you.

06:52.186 --> 06:55.944
You know, they say the dog's mouth
is the cleanest part of its body.

06:56.615 --> 06:58.738
What do they say about its nose?

07:02.175 --> 07:04.469
- She said nothing during the exam?
- Nothing.

07:04.673 --> 07:06.864
She brings her in, then disappears...

07:07.070 --> 07:09.034
...leaves a fake number.
Why would she do that?

07:09.235 --> 07:11.630
- I have no idea.
- How could somebody do that?

07:11.832 --> 07:15.522
- We don't know the whole story.
- We can't reach her anywhere.

07:15.728 --> 07:19.883
I'll move Tatiana out to Curtain 2
so she doesn't feel so alone back here.

07:20.090 --> 07:23.450
Then I guess I'll have to call
Children and Family Services.

07:26.516 --> 07:28.070
- Thanks, Haleh.
- Sure.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.940
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?

07:32.710 --> 07:34.298
Tatiana...

07:47.793 --> 07:48.883
My mother's Russian.

07:49.325 --> 07:51.118
How do you say "hello"?

07:55.318 --> 07:59.246
I'm Dr. Ross. I'm Doug.
I'm Doug.

08:01.544 --> 08:03.270
So you do speak a little English.

08:06.772 --> 08:08.702
So you don't.

08:09.136 --> 08:11.827
You just stay right here.
We'll take care of you.

08:28.249 --> 08:29.440
That was normal.

08:29.648 --> 08:30.839
What do you mean?

08:31.046 --> 08:35.201
Valentine's Day. It's like full moons.
All the crazies come out.

08:35.741 --> 08:39.395
- What's wrong with your neck?
- I slept on the sofa last night.

08:39.736 --> 08:42.823
Sorry I asked.
You wanna tell me about it?

08:43.033 --> 08:46.620
It's about five feet long.
It's got little blue flowers on it.

08:46.829 --> 08:48.917
There's a spectacular stain
on the right...

08:49.126 --> 08:51.589
...where Rachel did
some projectile vomiting.

08:51.790 --> 08:54.050
Still waiting on that stomach ache
and migraine.

08:54.254 --> 08:57.217
I am going to go get something to eat.

08:57.917 --> 08:59.813
I'm loving this
semi-foul mood of yours.

09:00.014 --> 09:03.306
Yeah? Well, imagine if
we'd lost the dog. See you.

09:03.511 --> 09:04.601
Bye.

09:04.809 --> 09:08.431
- Doug?
- "Do not steal. Benton."

09:08.638 --> 09:10.068
Anything good to eat in there?

09:10.270 --> 09:12.597
You think Susan
really wants this yogurt?

09:13.832 --> 09:16.295
So you and Jen Valentining tonight?

09:16.497 --> 09:18.619
She left for Milwaukee this morning.

09:18.827 --> 09:20.257
- You?
- No, no. Never.

09:20.458 --> 09:24.943
I work the night shift Valentine's Day
to avoid any possible dating conflicts.

09:25.154 --> 09:27.515
- That sounds mature.
- I learned the hard way.

09:27.717 --> 09:31.111
Dr. Ross, an ambulance is bringing
a 17-year-old. Crushed legs.

09:31.314 --> 09:33.402
Some train accident.
Dr. Benton said to get you.

09:33.611 --> 09:35.370
Thank you, Wendy.

09:37.940 --> 09:40.130
Can you believe I said "thank you"
for telling me...

09:40.404 --> 09:45.330
...I get to work on some kid whose legs
have just been purÃ©ed? Weird.

09:45.798 --> 09:48.159
I thought you'd like some company.

09:50.193 --> 09:52.679
Is that okay?
Had to clear Trauma anyway.

09:52.890 --> 09:54.184
Thanks.

09:57.951 --> 10:00.540
Carol, I could use you
in Curtain Area 3.

10:02.180 --> 10:04.541
You know, Mark always says
Valentine's Day...

10:04.744 --> 10:06.900
...is like the full moon.
The nut cases come out.

10:07.108 --> 10:09.072
I never really thought about it.

10:09.272 --> 10:10.930
Cheerleaders.

10:11.137 --> 10:12.158
Cheerleaders?

10:12.369 --> 10:13.663
On acid.

10:13.867 --> 10:16.489
Sounds like Mark was right.

10:17.563 --> 10:19.754
- Are you Kirk Driscoll?
- Sure.

10:19.960 --> 10:24.513
I'm Dr. Lewis. This is Nurse Hathaway.
All three girls ingested LSD?

10:25.188 --> 10:26.244
It's not funny.

10:26.454 --> 10:28.815
Are you sure it was straight LSD
and not mixed?

10:28.984 --> 10:31.539
Yeah. I got them right here
if you wanna check.

10:31.747 --> 10:34.972
- You laced chocolates?
- Pretty stupid, huh?

10:36.076 --> 10:37.665
I only let them eat two each.

10:37.875 --> 10:41.769
They could've had a seizure,
kidney damage, gone into a coma.

10:43.635 --> 10:46.722
We have to make sure
there's no dangerous side effects.

10:46.931 --> 10:48.918
You don't have to
tell the cops, do you?

10:49.129 --> 10:50.151
Yeah, we do.

10:50.361 --> 10:52.915
And better yet,
we get to tell your parents.

10:58.985 --> 11:01.346
- Any Valentine's Day plans?
- Nope.

11:01.548 --> 11:03.808
- No big date or anything?
- Nope.

11:04.213 --> 11:08.107
So what was that about? The flowers
and the chocolates in the fridge?

11:08.308 --> 11:09.772
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.800
I met this pediatrician...

11:13.003 --> 11:15.229
You what? You what?

11:16.765 --> 11:19.160
Hey, Peter! What?

11:24.557 --> 11:26.952
- What do you got?
- Michael Clifford, 17.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.811
Lost a dare with a freight train.

11:29.019 --> 11:31.414
Leg and head injuries.
Hypotensive, 80 over 60.

11:31.616 --> 11:34.205
Fluid resuscitated 2,000cc's.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.936
Brought the pressure up to 100.

11:37.143 --> 11:39.265
Blood loss around
three to four units.

11:39.674 --> 11:42.159
Someone get on the horn with O.R.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.632
Hang ten liters saline.

11:44.835 --> 11:48.195
- Start him on Ancef, one gram, IV push.
- BP's dropped 80 over 40.

11:48.397 --> 11:49.918
- Where's that O-neg?
- It's coming.

11:50.129 --> 11:51.888
Another blood Y-tubing.

11:55.057 --> 11:57.385
Popliteal. No dorsalis pedis
on the left.

11:57.588 --> 11:59.246
Let's get an angiogram.

12:00.085 --> 12:01.674
Oh, God! He's got my hand!

12:01.883 --> 12:04.006
- Don't lose that airway.
- He's seizing!

12:09.008 --> 12:11.563
He's breaking her hand!

12:12.705 --> 12:13.828
Grab a bite block!

12:54.026 --> 12:56.615
Bounce-back migraine in 6.

12:57.023 --> 12:58.714
I already saw him.

12:58.921 --> 13:02.849
No, you saw the one in 1.
This is the one in 6.

13:09.643 --> 13:11.402
Don't you guys work?

13:20.730 --> 13:23.058
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.611
- You thought I was in a bad mood?
- What?

13:31.186 --> 13:32.514
- Oh, my God.
- I gotta go.

13:32.717 --> 13:34.613
- Don't you dare leave me.
- Excuse me.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.274
- Dr. Lewis?
- Dr. Kayson.

13:37.846 --> 13:38.969
Will you be mine?

13:39.177 --> 13:40.607
Excuse me?

13:41.941 --> 13:43.837
Happy Valentine's Day.

14:03.350 --> 14:05.711
- Still 100.
- McGillis is here.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.411
I'll be right back, okay?

14:11.908 --> 14:14.303
Carol, how long is Sparky
gonna be with us?

14:14.505 --> 14:16.492
Until Grabarsky gets off duty tonight.

14:16.702 --> 14:19.097
"One of God's creatures."

14:38.845 --> 14:40.207
Hey, Deb.

14:42.242 --> 14:44.637
Deb? You all right?

14:45.072 --> 14:46.162
What?

14:47.137 --> 14:48.726
I said, are you okay?

14:50.766 --> 14:52.253
Yeah. Sure.

14:53.562 --> 14:54.686
Very okay.

14:54.862 --> 14:57.416
She left four hours ago.
Does that mean abandonment?

14:57.625 --> 14:59.384
- It does.
- Merits an investigation.

14:59.590 --> 15:02.882
She dumps a child who's sick,
speaks no English, has no clue...

15:03.086 --> 15:06.446
It's okay. Tatiana needs to
stay here at least 24 hours.

15:06.648 --> 15:08.635
Longer if she doesn't get any better.

15:08.846 --> 15:09.833
Then what happens?

15:10.011 --> 15:11.838
Assuming Mom's still
out of the picture...

15:12.043 --> 15:15.472
...Children and Family Services
will find her a foster home.

15:15.672 --> 15:17.727
There's nothing else we can do.

15:20.034 --> 15:21.895
I have a lot of work to do.

15:27.559 --> 15:29.580
I'm being released today.

15:29.890 --> 15:31.581
You've made a remarkable recovery.

15:31.788 --> 15:35.148
I couldn't have done it without you,
Susan. May I call you Susan?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.679
Sure.

15:37.648 --> 15:40.509
You said you needed to
talk to me about something.

15:40.712 --> 15:43.073
Every cardiologist should
go through what I did.

15:43.276 --> 15:47.135
Lying on that gurney, not knowing
whether you're gonna live or die...

15:47.338 --> 15:51.698
...and seeing the face of this lovely,
young resident hovering over you.

15:52.132 --> 15:55.720
Well, I can understand how
it must've been very scary for you.

15:55.928 --> 15:57.586
It was terrifying at first.

15:57.793 --> 15:59.950
But then, exhilarating.

16:00.623 --> 16:03.212
Now I've got a whole new
perspective on life.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.884
My own and my patients'.

16:05.085 --> 16:06.413
That's terrific.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.240
I really should get back.

16:08.448 --> 16:10.638
Have you thought about cardiology,
Susan?

16:11.611 --> 16:15.062
You'd be an excellent candidate.
And I'd like to help you.

16:15.274 --> 16:17.703
Be a mentor of sorts.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.359
- Thank you, Dr. Kayson...
- No, please...

16:20.568 --> 16:21.589
...call me Jack.

16:24.331 --> 16:28.725
I'm still doing my ER residency.
I should just stick with that for now.

16:30.224 --> 16:32.347
We should talk more
about this another time.

16:32.555 --> 16:33.644
That'd be fine.

16:33.854 --> 16:35.976
Tonight, 8:00...

16:36.550 --> 16:37.537
...dinner?

16:44.442 --> 16:45.531
How's the pain?

16:45.741 --> 16:47.262
I had a fifth of Demerol.

16:47.472 --> 16:49.698
You mean 50 milligrams of Demerol?

16:51.202 --> 16:54.789
I see that it's working.
Can you wiggle these fingers for me?

16:57.828 --> 17:01.222
- I should stick with decorating.
- He crushed your hand pretty good.

17:01.423 --> 17:04.681
You've got three metacarpal fractures,
but I think you'll survive.

17:04.886 --> 17:07.281
I'll get somebody to put a cast on.

17:07.483 --> 17:09.503
- How's the boy?
- Boy?

17:09.714 --> 17:11.270
The one who squeezed me...

17:11.479 --> 17:13.568
...got hit by that train.

17:14.942 --> 17:17.428
He died up in O.R.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.963
Dr. Greene, dueling meatpackers
coming in. About five minutes away.

17:25.698 --> 17:26.684
- Carol?
- What?

17:26.896 --> 17:28.258
- Whoa.
- Sorry.

17:28.461 --> 17:32.048
- Are we not loving our job?
- I am not loving the limits of my job.

17:32.257 --> 17:36.049
Watching that little girl sitting
out there, completely abandoned.

17:36.252 --> 17:37.239
Nothing we can do.

17:37.451 --> 17:39.347
Maybe you need a change of pace.

17:39.549 --> 17:41.637
How about a nice, greasy trauma?

17:41.846 --> 17:43.469
Sunny-side up or over-easy?

17:43.678 --> 17:44.972
I can offer you both.

17:45.176 --> 17:47.197
Okay, but how long do I have to wait?

17:47.407 --> 17:50.064
That's the beauty of it. You don't.

17:52.402 --> 17:55.092
- Happy Valentine's Day, Doris.
- Likewise, Dr. Greene.

17:55.299 --> 17:56.695
Meet Mr. Lorenzo Renzetti.

17:56.896 --> 18:00.518
45, sturdy, aluminum meat hook
firmly embedded in his bicep.

18:00.725 --> 18:02.121
How's that feel, Mr. Renzetti?

18:02.324 --> 18:05.310
You can call me Lorenzo.
I don't know, it's not so bad.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.780
That's good, because it sure looks bad.

18:07.984 --> 18:12.309
Started one IV. BP is 140 over 90.
Pulse 96, resp's 16.

18:12.513 --> 18:14.772
Good distal pulses,
normal cap refill.

18:14.977 --> 18:17.804
Defensive lacerations on both arms.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.365
Mr. Renzetti,
we're gonna take care of you.

18:20.571 --> 18:22.501
All right, we're gonna move him.

18:23.401 --> 18:25.591
All right, on my count.

18:25.798 --> 18:26.922
- One...
- Watch your back.

18:27.130 --> 18:29.060
Why don't you just scoot over.

18:29.262 --> 18:30.624
Don't let the gurney roll.

18:30.826 --> 18:32.586
Okay. Good.
I got you.

18:32.790 --> 18:34.311
Doris, you said this was a twofer.

18:34.523 --> 18:37.350
Second guy, second unit.
I drove circles around him.

18:37.552 --> 18:40.311
Let's hand some Ancef,
one gram, IV piggyback...

18:40.516 --> 18:42.309
...and let's update Lorenzo's tetanus.

18:42.514 --> 18:43.536
I'll start a chart.

18:43.745 --> 18:45.641
I had that when I went
to the Caribbean.

18:45.843 --> 18:48.500
- How was it?
- It was all right. It rained a lot.

18:48.707 --> 18:50.864
Want a chest film
plus humerus films?

18:51.071 --> 18:53.626
Call Radiology and get a portable.

18:53.834 --> 18:56.060
Lorenzo. Just lay down, okay?
Take it easy.

18:56.265 --> 18:59.057
They should've brought
Paulie here first.

18:59.262 --> 19:00.249
Who's Paulie?

19:00.727 --> 19:02.986
My stupid kid.
He made a crack about his mother.

19:03.191 --> 19:05.847
I didn't want to fight,
but he kept coming at me.

19:06.055 --> 19:07.349
Move your thumb.

19:07.553 --> 19:10.414
- Now your wrist.
- He kept jabbing me.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.807
You shouldn't disrespect your mother.
Where is the son of a bitch?

19:14.012 --> 19:15.805
I'm sure he's on his way.

19:16.010 --> 19:18.973
He'd better be, because he's
in worse shape than I am.

19:19.173 --> 19:21.534
We're gonna take this out in surgery.

19:21.737 --> 19:24.292
There he is! Hey, Paulie!

19:25.600 --> 19:28.155
I'm over here, son.
Your dad's over here.

19:31.227 --> 19:33.020
You okay? Son?

19:33.225 --> 19:34.917
Carol, come with me.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.075
He's in fib. Paddles.

19:41.149 --> 19:43.170
I'm right here, son.
I'm right here.

19:44.512 --> 19:45.636
Is he all right?

19:45.845 --> 19:47.433
- Two hundred.
- Charging.

19:47.643 --> 19:49.005
Clear.

19:52.171 --> 19:54.260
- Three hundred.
- Charging.

19:54.469 --> 19:56.557
- Is he okay?
- Clear.

19:56.833 --> 19:58.558
He's okay, right?

19:58.930 --> 20:01.156
- Damn it! 360.
- Charging.

20:06.755 --> 20:08.480
He needs more volume.

20:28.465 --> 20:31.825
It's gonna be okay.
You'll be fine.

21:00.031 --> 21:01.961
Exam 2? Okay, here we go.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.988
This way, you guys. There you go.

21:05.192 --> 21:07.587
We'll be with you in just a second.

21:08.555 --> 21:10.348
You have to admit,
they're pretty cute.

21:10.553 --> 21:13.072
They've been spray-painted,
giving them hives.

21:13.283 --> 21:15.610
Children with hives are not cute.

21:16.046 --> 21:17.374
So, Peter...

21:17.578 --> 21:21.869
...about the flower and candy
in the refrigerator?

21:22.473 --> 21:25.095
Are you gonna make me guess
who they're for?

21:25.669 --> 21:27.293
They're for my mother.

21:28.633 --> 21:29.689
Really.

21:36.458 --> 21:39.784
Excuse me, where is Exam Room 1?

21:50.209 --> 21:52.196
- Thanks for moving her.
- Oh, sure.

21:52.407 --> 21:54.667
She insisted on bringing Bill.

21:59.666 --> 22:03.923
Hello and goodbye. That and ten other
words is the extent of my Russian.

22:05.293 --> 22:07.314
They're kind of perfect together.

22:07.690 --> 22:09.517
No idea where they are or
what they're doing.

22:09.721 --> 22:13.910
- Neither one of them seem to mind.
- The dog gets to go home with Grabarsky.

22:14.117 --> 22:15.638
Maybe her mom will come back.

22:15.848 --> 22:18.334
I don't think "mom" is the right word.

22:18.978 --> 22:22.838
Carter, Dr. Ross needs you to help
with some kids in Exam 2.

22:23.107 --> 22:24.696
How do you say goodbye?

22:44.650 --> 22:46.637
Tell Dr. Ross I need him now.

22:59.800 --> 23:00.992
Hey, Deb.

23:14.684 --> 23:16.773
Are you Wendy Goldman?

23:17.081 --> 23:18.602
Yes...

23:18.813 --> 23:20.175
...Deb.

23:21.510 --> 23:22.906
I'm Deborah Chen.

23:23.108 --> 23:24.402
I know that.

23:24.973 --> 23:27.697
I had the hardest time finding you.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.391
I'm gonna be doing your cast.

23:38.492 --> 23:41.182
- How long was he in the hot tub?
- 40 minutes.

23:41.389 --> 23:42.943
- Any wine?
- Champagne.

23:43.153 --> 23:45.140
- How much?
- A little. A couple of bottles.

23:45.350 --> 23:48.676
- It's Valentine's Day.
- Eddie wanted something special.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.673
- He got nauseous.
- Then he threw up.

23:50.878 --> 23:52.842
- It was horrible.
- Then he sank.

23:53.042 --> 23:55.403
We went under.
Both of us pulled him up.

23:55.606 --> 23:56.900
Ran into the house.

23:57.105 --> 23:58.693
Called 911.

23:58.903 --> 24:01.423
- You did the right thing.
- We'll take it from here.

24:01.633 --> 24:03.654
We're gonna take his temperature now.

24:03.897 --> 24:04.919
Rectally.

24:05.129 --> 24:06.990
You might wanna wait outside.

24:11.289 --> 24:13.150
We'll be right back, okay?

24:14.786 --> 24:16.773
You still think
it's upper respiratory?

24:16.983 --> 24:19.469
Now that she's hydrated,
I heard rales.

24:19.679 --> 24:22.904
Could be pneumonia or a foreign virus
we know nothing about.

24:23.109 --> 24:27.003
Fever's spiked up to 104.
I'm gonna put a rush on that x-ray.

24:27.205 --> 24:29.997
- You give her acetaminophen?
- Yeah. 15 per kilo.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.529
All the times my mom
tried to teach me Russian.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.287
All the times she yelled
at me in Russian.

24:34.498 --> 24:35.961
You deserved it.

24:36.129 --> 24:37.116
Doctor B.

24:37.328 --> 24:39.314
Mrs. Hayden, 85,
fell and cut her arm.

24:39.525 --> 24:42.715
She's in the Suture Room,
and she's a tad senile.

24:42.921 --> 24:43.943
Give it to Carter.

24:44.153 --> 24:46.878
He's busy taking care of
six small, red children.

24:47.083 --> 24:48.411
Where's the other one?

24:48.615 --> 24:51.238
Deb Chen? Doing a cast.

24:52.011 --> 24:53.407
All right, have her wait.

24:53.610 --> 24:55.664
Is Dr. Ross here?

24:55.907 --> 24:57.166
What's wrong?

24:57.372 --> 24:58.700
I'm Jake Leeds.

24:58.904 --> 25:01.458
I need to talk to Dr. Ross.

25:01.834 --> 25:05.887
Look, he's very busy right now.
I can find someone else for you.

25:06.429 --> 25:07.416
What's wrong?

25:07.627 --> 25:10.647
My side and my stomach.
It really hurts.

25:10.858 --> 25:12.617
We're gonna take him
to Curtain 2.

25:12.822 --> 25:15.411
Call his mom, Diane Leeds,
up in Risk Management.

25:15.619 --> 25:17.549
- Sure, Dr. Ross.
- Carol.

25:17.883 --> 25:20.505
Come on, buddy.
All right, what's wrong?

25:20.880 --> 25:22.707
Where's it hurt?
Here we go.

25:24.909 --> 25:26.998
It started here in my stomach...

25:27.206 --> 25:29.829
...and now it feels like
it's over here.

25:30.536 --> 25:32.125
Like this?

25:32.600 --> 25:34.461
There. It hurts there.

25:34.665 --> 25:37.128
Any vomiting or nausea?

25:38.428 --> 25:40.653
- Right after gym.
- Temp's normal.

25:40.858 --> 25:45.218
Okay, let's get a CBC, urinalysis
and set him up for an ultrasound.

25:45.420 --> 25:48.814
All right, Jake, hang tight.
We're gonna check you out.

25:51.147 --> 25:54.372
- Where are we gonna put him?
- Admitting him straight upstairs.

25:54.576 --> 25:58.595
Haleh, could you tell those two hookers
that their friend is doing fine?

25:58.805 --> 26:01.564
I think they'd rather
talk to a doctor.

26:01.769 --> 26:04.062
Tell them I'll meet them
in the waiting room.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.629
So what was that with Kayson?

26:07.829 --> 26:08.884
What?

26:09.094 --> 26:13.885
Oh, you know, he just wanted to
tell me that he was fine, thank me.

26:14.088 --> 26:16.574
Nice try.
I saw the bouquet.

26:16.786 --> 26:18.250
Oh, God.

26:18.550 --> 26:19.844
Did anyone else?

26:20.049 --> 26:22.308
It was so embarrassing.

26:22.513 --> 26:26.497
He just gave you flowers. It's not like
he asked you out or anything.

26:27.641 --> 26:29.128
- He did?
- Dinner, tonight.

26:29.339 --> 26:31.666
- What'd you say?
- I said...

26:32.335 --> 26:36.388
Mark, chopper on the way. Some woman
choked on her Valentine's dinner.

26:39.061 --> 26:41.956
I said I couldn't.
That I was doing something with you.

26:42.158 --> 26:43.417
You dragged me into it.

26:43.624 --> 26:46.382
- Mark, he's married.
- Yeah? Well, so am I.

26:51.914 --> 26:55.139
You're looking better, Jake.
Are you feeling better?

26:56.509 --> 26:57.632
No.

27:00.038 --> 27:03.160
Dr. Ross tells me you're a
very good basketball player.

27:03.336 --> 27:04.322
Yes, I am.

27:05.999 --> 27:09.654
I'm probably better than he is,
except he's older.

27:09.895 --> 27:12.188
- Is he divorced?
- What?

27:12.392 --> 27:15.513
My mom says divorced people
have baggage.

27:15.988 --> 27:18.543
Well, he isn't divorced.

27:19.184 --> 27:20.842
Then he doesn't have baggage.

27:22.647 --> 27:25.202
Well, I wouldn't say that exactly.

27:26.443 --> 27:29.531
- He's faking.
- How can you know that?

27:29.739 --> 27:34.394
Because he has that moany voice like
when he wants to stay home from school.

27:34.601 --> 27:37.393
- Could be appendicitis...
- He's done this before.

27:37.598 --> 27:41.152
- Faked illness?
- No, tried to set me up with single men.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.347
What?

27:42.560 --> 27:45.920
He likes you. I'm his mother,
and he's stuck with me.

27:46.122 --> 27:49.312
He thinks if he can get us to
spend time together, we will...

27:49.518 --> 27:51.243
...naturally, you know...

27:51.715 --> 27:53.941
- Well, that's...
- Obviously ridiculous.

27:55.212 --> 27:57.039
Obviously.

27:58.276 --> 28:00.069
And he's done this before?

28:00.740 --> 28:03.101
I've been through 5 or 6
departments here alone.

28:03.303 --> 28:05.290
Not to mention hardware stores.

28:05.501 --> 28:07.963
Jake feels I should either
be with a doctor...

28:08.164 --> 28:10.525
...or a man who knows
his way around nuts and bolts.

28:11.161 --> 28:13.749
So how do you suggest we handle this?

28:15.990 --> 28:17.215
Let's cut him open.

28:21.217 --> 28:22.204
The kid's faking it.

28:22.415 --> 28:25.276
Dr. Ross, test results back
on that Russian girl.

28:27.676 --> 28:29.163
Oh, man.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.437
Her white count's at 2,000.

28:31.639 --> 28:32.831
You mean 20,000.

28:33.037 --> 28:34.898
No. Two.

28:36.134 --> 28:38.030
And she has pneumonia.

28:40.396 --> 28:41.917
She's got AIDS.

28:55.047 --> 28:56.511
Mrs. Hayden?

28:58.577 --> 28:59.836
Yes?

29:00.174 --> 29:02.035
How did you get in here?

29:03.537 --> 29:06.557
There is no starch.

29:08.499 --> 29:10.429
No. No. You know what?

29:10.630 --> 29:12.560
We're out of starch.

29:13.893 --> 29:16.322
But I need it for Joe's uniform.

29:16.523 --> 29:18.782
Okay. Just sit right here.

29:21.251 --> 29:23.238
You know what? I'm going to...

29:23.450 --> 29:26.072
I'm gonna have to take
a look at this arm.

29:28.677 --> 29:31.504
I don't suppose
you remember if you're...

29:31.706 --> 29:35.328
...allergic to
lidocaine or Novocaine?

29:35.536 --> 29:38.193
Some of the wives don't bother.

29:38.733 --> 29:42.127
Okay. Well, we're just gonna
have to jump in here.

29:43.693 --> 29:47.644
Joe likes his uniform
and his collar crisp.

29:54.982 --> 29:57.275
Would you like me to...

29:57.479 --> 29:59.340
...iron your uniform?

30:08.434 --> 30:10.624
- All right.
- That'd be great.

30:14.494 --> 30:15.890
How can she do that?

30:16.092 --> 30:18.214
- It doesn't matter.
- It does to Tatiana.

30:18.423 --> 30:20.852
The situation is what it is.
We'll do what we can.

30:21.053 --> 30:24.777
Well, it isn't much. We bring down
her fever and kick her out?

30:24.982 --> 30:27.945
- Children and Family Services will...
- She's got AIDS!

30:28.146 --> 30:31.801
She doesn't speak English. She's
barely a candidate as a foster child.

30:32.007 --> 30:35.198
- So what do you suggest that we do?
- Anything else.

30:35.404 --> 30:37.300
There isn't anything else.

30:39.467 --> 30:40.523
I know.

30:43.096 --> 30:47.286
You know, these patients come in here
for an hour, maybe two...

30:47.491 --> 30:48.978
...maybe a day.

30:49.788 --> 30:53.944
We treat them fast, barely learn
their names and then send them home.

30:54.150 --> 30:56.205
Which is usually what they want.

30:58.546 --> 31:00.669
They usually have a home to go to.

31:01.077 --> 31:03.733
Dr. Ross, you've still got
those chickenpox in 3.

31:03.940 --> 31:05.461
Fine, Jerry.

31:37.537 --> 31:41.624
I'm sorry that the person who was
with you yesterday isn't here today.

31:43.730 --> 31:47.090
And I'm sorry that none of us
will be with you tomorrow.

31:54.551 --> 31:58.479
And I'm glad you can't understand
what's happening to you.

32:08.836 --> 32:10.391
Neither can I.

32:28.348 --> 32:30.335
Malik, move these hearts!

32:31.079 --> 32:33.133
Let's go!
We're going to Trauma 2.

32:33.343 --> 32:34.898
- What do you got?
- Anaphylaxis.

32:35.107 --> 32:38.661
My wife's allergic to shrimp
and scallops and all that stuff.

32:38.970 --> 32:41.831
Susan, this is Mr. Goodwin.
This is Dr. Lewis.

32:42.033 --> 32:45.654
We didn't order it.
It must've been that appetizer.

32:45.896 --> 32:48.552
We'll take care of her.
You need to wait outside.

32:48.759 --> 32:52.243
It happened once before. Her throat
swelled up, but not like this.

32:52.455 --> 32:54.385
- Two, three.

32:55.019 --> 32:57.278
Lydia, show Mr. Goodwin
where he can wait.

32:57.483 --> 32:58.845
Come on, Mr. Goodwin.

32:59.048 --> 33:02.205
Upper airway obstruction with stridor.

33:04.409 --> 33:07.599
- She's hypotensive.
- BP's 45 and palp.

33:07.805 --> 33:12.062
I'll intubate. Haleh, get a 6.5
and prep for a crike just in case.

33:12.301 --> 33:15.196
Epi, one to 10,000,
two cc's, IV push.

33:19.493 --> 33:21.718
This is hopeless.
Throat's completely swollen.

33:21.923 --> 33:24.546
Let's crike her. Grab a trach tube.

33:27.850 --> 33:30.405
Benadryl, IV 50 milligrams...

33:30.613 --> 33:33.905
...and cimetidine, IV 300 milligrams.

33:40.537 --> 33:42.557
Pressure's stabilizing, 100 over 80.

33:42.901 --> 33:44.558
Pulse ox 96.

33:44.765 --> 33:46.059
- It's peaking up.
- Nice.

33:46.563 --> 33:47.550
Thank you.

33:47.729 --> 33:50.317
Let's start an epi drip,
one milligram in 250...

33:50.559 --> 33:51.818
...at 10 mics per minute.

33:52.024 --> 33:55.350
Keep her on the antihistamines
until the swelling comes down.

33:57.618 --> 34:00.376
Oh, God! Mark, Susan!
Get over here!

34:02.179 --> 34:03.973
What happened?
She was stable.

34:04.177 --> 34:06.800
- Get her husband in here now!
- Her pressure's crashing.

34:07.007 --> 34:08.766
We gotta scope her.

34:11.603 --> 34:13.090
Did I perforate the esophagus?

34:13.300 --> 34:15.264
- You couldn't have.
- What'd I do wrong?

34:15.465 --> 34:17.984
Nothing. Get a CBC.
Type and cross six units...

34:18.195 --> 34:20.783
...lytes, LFTs, amylase.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.518
Oh, my God! What happened?

34:23.956 --> 34:25.920
- What happened?
- Lydia, call for O-neg.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.106
- Has your wife been vomiting recently?
- No.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.438
- Does she have any history of ulcer?
- No.

34:32.846 --> 34:34.900
She has bleeding varices. SP, tube.

34:35.110 --> 34:37.370
Varices? What the hell is this?

34:37.574 --> 34:39.731
Mr. Goodwin, is your wife an alcoholic?

34:44.433 --> 34:45.692
Is she?

34:47.563 --> 34:49.652
All right. Get the catcher's mask.

34:56.654 --> 34:58.583
Inflate the balloon to 200cc's.

35:01.048 --> 35:02.535
It's in the stomach.

35:03.146 --> 35:06.700
Okay, inflate the esophageal balloon
to 40 millimeters.

35:16.099 --> 35:17.529
It's stopped.

35:18.296 --> 35:19.522
Great pickup, Susan.

35:29.118 --> 35:33.545
Well, her fever's back down to 100.
You're feeling better, aren't you?

35:33.746 --> 35:36.732
Will you keep an eye on her for me?
Thanks.

35:38.208 --> 35:41.000
- I should've gone into real estate.
- That bad, huh?

35:41.204 --> 35:43.327
- I got off two hours ago.
- Me too.

35:43.536 --> 35:44.830
Can I borrow a pen?

35:45.034 --> 35:46.555
Well, we gotta do something.

35:46.766 --> 35:49.161
I don't want Kayson to think
you're a liar.

35:49.362 --> 35:51.757
- Carol, you wanna come?
- I'm on tonight.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.981
- Sorry.
- Bye.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.393
She's very ill.

36:18.831 --> 36:19.954
I know.

36:20.162 --> 36:22.285
You can't take her home tonight.

36:25.357 --> 36:26.583
I know.

36:27.221 --> 36:29.242
After this morning, I'm not sure...

36:29.453 --> 36:31.882
...you'll ever be able
to take her home.

36:35.778 --> 36:37.742
I don't want to.

36:57.022 --> 36:58.509
Mrs. Hayden?

37:15.269 --> 37:17.425
I guess you found the starch.

37:25.758 --> 37:28.653
When I found out that
I could adopt Tatiana...

37:28.854 --> 37:31.409
...I bought a
Russian-English dictionary.

37:31.618 --> 37:33.740
Never got much beyond
hello and goodbye.

37:33.949 --> 37:37.002
- Mrs. Hall...
- Can you imagine anything worse...

37:39.043 --> 37:40.939
...than abandoning a child
with AIDS?

37:42.339 --> 37:43.429
No.

37:45.070 --> 37:47.465
She was diagnosed last Thursday
at St. John's.

37:48.566 --> 37:51.892
Look, Mrs. Hall,
or whatever your name is...

37:52.328 --> 37:54.451
...l'm not exactly sure
why you're here.

37:54.660 --> 37:58.144
But I'm not interested in listening
to you say how sorry you are.

37:59.821 --> 38:02.443
My husband died three years ago.

38:02.751 --> 38:03.942
It was...

38:04.149 --> 38:05.703
...long and slow.

38:07.312 --> 38:08.436
I was young.

38:08.644 --> 38:10.404
You get through. You go on.

38:11.308 --> 38:14.737
I never really felt that loss
until last week.

38:14.937 --> 38:16.867
I never allowed myself to feel it.

38:17.968 --> 38:19.523
Until I...

38:21.064 --> 38:23.358
...looked at Tatiana...

38:23.927 --> 38:25.323
...and I said...

38:26.291 --> 38:28.085
..."There it is."

38:31.986 --> 38:33.574
I cannot...

38:33.784 --> 38:37.473
...I will not let myself
get that close to someone...

38:37.680 --> 38:39.541
...and lose them again.

38:44.805 --> 38:46.859
I brought her things.

39:16.970 --> 39:19.455
I forgot how to say goodbye.

39:43.574 --> 39:44.902
Mom?

40:46.939 --> 40:48.902
Happy Valentine's Day.

41:00.490 --> 41:02.919
- This is fun?
- This is fun.

41:03.121 --> 41:05.108
It's 20 degrees out.

41:05.951 --> 41:08.073
Okay, this is fun.

41:08.382 --> 41:12.174
Did I tell you Morgenstern offered
me a job as attending next year?

41:12.377 --> 41:14.671
What? No, you didn't tell me.

41:14.875 --> 41:17.895
That's right, it was last week.
You weren't talking to me.

41:18.104 --> 41:21.090
So, you were talking to me.
What'd you tell him?

41:21.301 --> 41:24.128
- That I had to think about it.
- Oh, please.

41:24.431 --> 41:26.894
Well, you know,
there's Jennifer to consider.

41:27.095 --> 41:28.718
Which I didn't.

41:29.092 --> 41:30.647
What'd she say?

41:31.024 --> 41:32.716
What do you think she said?

41:33.222 --> 41:34.981
That, "I'm happy for you, Mark...

41:35.186 --> 41:37.445
...because I know this is
what you really want"?

41:37.651 --> 41:41.170
The "this is what you really want" part?
That's right.

41:41.380 --> 41:42.968
Sounds bad.

41:43.177 --> 41:44.664
It was.

41:45.109 --> 41:47.096
So what are you gonna do?

41:47.306 --> 41:49.861
I am going to skate.

41:55.231 --> 41:57.195
Help, I need a doctor!

41:58.860 --> 42:00.824
Is there a doctor?

42:13.877 --> 42:15.898
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wendy.

42:16.108 --> 42:19.230
I understand that she did it
perfectly on the dog.

42:19.438 --> 42:20.494
I'll fix it tomorrow.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.860
I think I'm gonna stay home tomorrow.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.625
Hang in there.
