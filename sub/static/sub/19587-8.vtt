00:57.467 --> 00:59.567

fellas here to see you!

01:04.367 --> 01:05.967
-Jerry Lee!
-Yes, Mama?

01:06.067 --> 01:07.767
You Jerry Lee Lewis?

01:07.833 --> 01:09.633

01:09.700 --> 01:10.867

01:10.933 --> 01:13.100

01:14.333 --> 01:15.767
Uh... What's her name?

01:15.833 --> 01:18.200
My God, he don't know
how many he diddled.

01:18.267 --> 01:20.500

a heck of a mess.

01:20.567 --> 01:23.267
Janie's got a young one
coming, swears it's yours.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.500
-You get outta here, boy!

01:25.567 --> 01:28.067
You can't even keep it
in your damn pants! Get out!

01:28.067 --> 01:30.233
Now, sir, I'll do the right
thing by your sister,

01:30.300 --> 01:31.733
but first, there's a few
things I have to clear up...

01:31.800 --> 01:33.800
She's in the car, you and her
is getting hitched.

01:33.867 --> 01:35.800

-All right. Now, you see...

01:38.467 --> 01:41.633
You comin' with us
or it's gonna get rough.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.500

in school tomorrow?

01:43.567 --> 01:45.500

can we, Marion?

05:02.967 --> 05:05.400
I saw what I saw.

05:10.667 --> 05:14.067
And I saw you
with your baby, Sam.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.700
It tore my heart out.

05:20.067 --> 05:22.533
Right then and there, I knew
that would never be me.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.667
Maybe I should leave Sun.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.500
Marion...

05:45.533 --> 05:48.867
Sun may be circling the drain,

05:52.167 --> 05:54.667
but I got a feelin'...

05:54.733 --> 05:57.367
we are on the edge
of somethin'.

05:59.633 --> 06:03.900
And we didn't come this far
for you to quit.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.200
There's no place for me
in your life.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.567
We started this together.

06:16.233 --> 06:18.533
I don't see a future.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.567
Of course you do.

06:25.433 --> 06:27.667

06:30.733 --> 06:34.100
is the ticket to it.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.400
Thank you.

06:44.467 --> 06:48.533
Okay, they're here.
Go grab a drink.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.233
Oh, that's them. Come on.

06:50.300 --> 06:52.800
Him? He's the one?

06:54.367 --> 06:56.333
I come in here with you to
sign the next Hank Williams,

06:56.400 --> 06:57.800
next Eddy Arnold,

06:57.867 --> 06:59.267
not some greasy haired
ass-wiggler.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.767
Look, I don't let them

07:01.833 --> 07:03.133
Go on, get, get, get, get.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.900
Right there.

07:06.733 --> 07:08.500
So glad you could make it.

07:08.567 --> 07:12.867
We're grateful to Mr. Phillips
for taking a chance on Elvis.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.200
But Mr. Phillips
can't pull the strings

07:15.267 --> 07:17.333
to get Elvis on television...

07:17.400 --> 07:18.533
I can.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.833
Well, what's the point

07:19.900 --> 07:22.233
if his records are only
available around here?

07:22.300 --> 07:25.800
And he doesn't have any plans
for an Elvis Presley LP.

07:25.867 --> 07:27.400
There are no LPs on Sun

07:27.467 --> 07:29.633
because they don't have
the money to get 'em pressed.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.833
Television, LPs...

07:33.900 --> 07:35.367
It all sounds mighty excitin'.

07:35.433 --> 07:37.800
Well, and mighty profitable.

07:37.867 --> 07:40.433
You'll see plenty
if Elvis signs with me,

07:40.500 --> 07:41.933
I guarantee you.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.367
Colonel, sir...

07:44.433 --> 07:45.700
If I were to leave Sun,

07:45.767 --> 07:49.067
would Mr. Phillips
still make it out okay?

07:49.133 --> 07:50.900
Oh, Hank!
Hey, that's Hank.

07:50.967 --> 07:53.067
-Hank, come on over.
-Great to meet you, folks.

07:53.067 --> 07:54.700
-Pleasure.
-I understand

07:54.767 --> 07:56.167
that the Colonel has
promised you front row tickets

07:56.233 --> 07:58.067
to my show.

07:58.067 --> 08:01.067
-Thank you, sir.
-Oh, my! Thank you!

08:01.133 --> 08:03.800
We love that Golden Rocket
song, don't we, Vern?

08:03.867 --> 08:07.067
Oh, shoot, we love 'em all.

08:07.067 --> 08:09.167
You were sayin'
about Mr. Phillips.

08:09.233 --> 08:12.933
Uh, this document
gives Hank and I

08:13.067 --> 08:16.067
the right
to approach Mr. Phillips

08:16.067 --> 08:18.300
about getting Elvis off Sun.

08:19.467 --> 08:21.833
We'll take over
Elvis' management

08:21.900 --> 08:24.067
when Mr. Neal's term is up.

08:24.067 --> 08:26.267
And I'll personally look out
for your boy.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.867
But Elvis is... Is so young,

08:28.933 --> 08:31.267
it seems like
an awful lot awful fast.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.433
I keep telling you,

08:32.500 --> 08:34.533
you got to quit
coddlin' the boy.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.100
He's got to grow up.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.067
Son, this is your dream.

08:41.067 --> 08:42.467
And Colonel Parker here
is the one

08:42.533 --> 08:44.767
who's gonna make that happen.

08:44.833 --> 08:47.333
You're right, Daddy.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.767
Because Elvis is underage,
we need your signature.

08:50.833 --> 08:54.433
Hank has already
pre-signed this agreement.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.933
That's how much faith we have.

08:56.067 --> 08:57.333
Yeah.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.800
We, we get the feelin'
you're both honorable men,

09:00.867 --> 09:03.667
and I trust you, I really do,

09:03.733 --> 09:05.200
to do what's best for our boy.

09:05.267 --> 09:07.867
Mr. Presley, we know
what it's like to be cheated.

09:07.933 --> 09:10.333
-Mmm.
-That ain't our way.

09:11.767 --> 09:14.367
Oh! Look, the ducks!
You have to see this.

09:14.433 --> 09:15.700

09:15.767 --> 09:17.133

show them that, please?

Mr. Phillips? Colonel Parker.

15:55.767 --> 15:58.067
-Right this way.
-Colonel.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.233
You said Elvis and Bob Neal
would be here.

Unavoidably detained.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.200
Wouldn't you agree?

16:13.700 --> 16:17.800
-And what business are you in?

16:17.867 --> 16:20.867
There's only one thing
standing between Elvis Presley

16:20.933 --> 16:22.667
and the success
that he deserves,

16:22.733 --> 16:26.967
and that... is Sun Records.

16:27.067 --> 16:28.933
Well, considering
he hadn't sung in no place

16:29.067 --> 16:31.800
outside his bedroom
when I found him,

16:31.867 --> 16:33.133
how do you figure?

16:35.133 --> 16:37.333
You got
no national distribution

16:37.400 --> 16:39.733
and you're on hold with
at least one pressing plant

16:39.800 --> 16:41.067
for non-payment.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.767
Who told you that?

16:43.833 --> 16:46.400
Well, let's just say
someone less well-disposed

16:46.467 --> 16:47.867
than the Colonel

16:47.933 --> 16:50.333
would sue on the boy's behalf
for unpaid royalties.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.933
Then, if Sun went
into bankruptcy,

16:52.067 --> 16:54.333
-his contract...
-But the fact is...

16:54.400 --> 16:57.067
I have a current contract
with Elvis

16:57.100 --> 17:00.167
that has a long time to run.

17:00.233 --> 17:02.133
Eighteen months, two weeks.

17:08.467 --> 17:10.733
I have Elvis' word
he'll renew.

17:13.067 --> 17:15.533
I have Elvis' assent

17:15.600 --> 17:20.467
signed by his daddy
to look for a better label.

17:21.867 --> 17:23.100
Lemme see that.

17:24.100 --> 17:25.467
With your assent,

17:25.533 --> 17:28.733
I'll sell the boy's contract
to a major label.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.400
That money clears your debt.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.400
Once he's a big star,
word will get out

17:33.467 --> 17:35.800
it was Sun Records
that discovered him.

17:35.867 --> 17:37.400
They'll flock to you.

17:37.467 --> 17:40.933
Then, you'll have the money
to make Sun Records.

17:41.067 --> 17:43.467
It's either that
or you go bust,

17:43.533 --> 17:46.067
and you take
Presley down with you.

17:53.767 --> 17:54.967
Colonel...

17:55.900 --> 17:57.600
And if you're a colonel,

17:57.667 --> 17:59.733
then I'm the general's
daughter.

18:03.867 --> 18:05.433
You have my assent...

18:07.933 --> 18:09.500

20:03.933 --> 20:06.200

20:06.267 --> 20:09.433
You build your franchise

Yankees around Mickey Mantle,

Money's never been
what's driven you.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.333
I don't think that's
what drives Elvis, either.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.900
It's the music.

22:38.967 --> 22:40.867
Always the music.

Colonel Parker mentioned
that if we sell Elvis,

22:53.900 --> 22:56.200
we can clear all our debts.

22:57.567 --> 22:59.333
And he ain't 100% wrong.

23:02.933 --> 23:06.067
I'm gonna ask
for the stupid money...

23:06.900 --> 23:09.367

26:17.633 --> 26:20.067
Alan Freed is going around
tellin' everyone

26:20.133 --> 26:22.233
that he invented
rock 'n' roll.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.567
Man, that ain't nothing
but steamin' bull-crap.

26:24.633 --> 26:28.067
'Cause you know
we started it right here!

26:28.133 --> 26:30.467
Right here! Didn't we, Slick?

26:30.533 --> 26:34.167
Rocket 88. Boy, Elvis Presley.

26:36.133 --> 26:37.167
We sure did.

26:37.233 --> 26:39.633
Alan Freed, boy. Alan Freed...

26:39.700 --> 26:42.167
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll,
my ass, boy!

26:42.233 --> 26:44.200
Freed don't make the hits!

26:44.267 --> 26:45.667
I know.

26:45.733 --> 26:49.533
Only way he knows a hit
if it's got a 50 inside it.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.700
No, I wouldn't take 50 bucks
to play your lousy record.

26:52.767 --> 26:55.200
Hell, if it's good,
I'll pay you 50 to play it!

26:55.267 --> 26:56.800
Well, that's damn right.

26:56.867 --> 26:59.333
That's the difference
between you and him.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.767
Now, come on, man,
get down from there. Come on.

27:02.833 --> 27:05.900
Man, no, there's
1,000 differences

27:05.967 --> 27:07.933
between me and Freed.

27:08.067 --> 27:10.533
Yeah. There are dollars...

27:10.600 --> 27:12.367
and Freed's got 'em.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.300
You try to tell that to

27:18.367 --> 27:24.433
Mr. Earle, Mr. Big Shot
Station Manager, WHBQ.

27:24.500 --> 27:28.200
He won't spend one red cent

27:28.267 --> 27:30.467
on any kind of ad
in cash bucks

27:30.533 --> 27:33.400
to tell the world the truth
that it was me

27:33.467 --> 27:36.733
that found this kind of
music, man. It was me!

27:36.800 --> 27:38.233
Dewey Phillips!

27:39.100 --> 27:41.367
I know, I know.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.733
Oh!

27:49.800 --> 27:52.433
-Come on now...
-Oh.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.867
Well, go on, man.

27:55.933 --> 27:58.867
Tell me all your sorrows.

27:58.933 --> 28:01.667
Go on, spit it all out.

28:01.733 --> 28:03.967
Even though you're
kind of stealing my thunder.

28:07.933 --> 28:11.067
I might have done something
that I shouldn't have, Dewey.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.700
Oh!

28:13.633 --> 28:15.467
Even if I get what I want...

28:16.400 --> 28:18.733
I may not be happy.

28:19.967 --> 28:21.567
If I don't...

28:21.633 --> 28:25.300
I sure as hell know
I'm gonna be pissed.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.733
Last call. Last call.

28:39.733 --> 28:41.233
Oh, don't go through
any trouble.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.267
I would love to talk,
but I'm running so late.

28:43.333 --> 28:45.367
It's great to see you.
You look lovely today.

28:45.433 --> 28:48.067
Humpty Dumpty just
walked in. I'll call you back.

28:48.133 --> 28:50.333
Don't sit.
You're not staying long.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.567
Well, Steve, it's time
for us to move forward

28:52.633 --> 28:55.300
from whatever bad feelings
you might have.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.233
What do you want now,
a new hi-fi?

28:57.300 --> 29:00.467
Ever hear of Elvis Presley?

29:00.533 --> 29:01.833
The girls pee their drawers,

29:01.900 --> 29:03.267
their boyfriends want
to cut his nuts off,

29:03.333 --> 29:04.800
and the older crowd walks out.

29:04.867 --> 29:06.667
-Yeah, I heard of him.

29:06.733 --> 29:08.867
Well, the older crowd
doesn't buy records.

29:08.933 --> 29:10.133
You told me that.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.300
Get where you're going.

29:11.367 --> 29:12.733
What you're selling,
how much.

29:13.667 --> 29:15.900
The boy's contract. 40,000.

29:15.967 --> 29:17.867
Shut the door on your way out.

29:17.933 --> 29:19.967
Hmm. It's not like
there's no other interest.

29:20.067 --> 29:22.367
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

29:22.433 --> 29:23.733
I hear the buzz, I'm not deaf.

29:24.767 --> 29:26.333
But 40,000?

29:26.400 --> 29:29.867
I could fix the World Series
for less than that.

29:29.933 --> 29:32.767
Steve, your artists
only sell in the south,

29:32.833 --> 29:36.233
this boy will sell
coast-to-coast, overseas,

29:36.300 --> 29:38.067
if you put some
promotional juice behind him.

29:38.067 --> 29:42.433
-If you get him on TV, if...
-If, if and more if.

29:42.500 --> 29:46.533
Well, now,
every deal's a gamble.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.500
We all know
you love to gamble.

29:52.967 --> 29:54.667
I'd want all his old records.

29:54.733 --> 29:56.800
I don't want RCA
to push the hell out of him,

29:56.867 --> 29:58.433
have Sun putting out
all his older stuff,

29:58.500 --> 30:00.600
splitting airplay.

30:00.667 --> 30:02.033
Lemme take
the temperature in New York,

30:02.100 --> 30:04.067
if I can lay any losses
against Snow's royalties.

30:04.133 --> 30:06.367
No.

30:06.433 --> 30:10.300
This is a deal between
RCA and the Colonel.

30:11.300 --> 30:12.500
Thought you two were partners.

30:13.167 --> 30:14.300
Were.

30:14.367 --> 30:16.667
And this is not
a drawn-out negotiation.

30:16.733 --> 30:19.333
Payment in full,
no counter offers.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.600
Okay? October 31, 7:00 p.m.

30:21.667 --> 30:24.267
One week, one day, four hours.

30:25.467 --> 30:27.400
Good to see you, Steve.

30:31.067 --> 30:32.867
Forty thousand?

30:32.933 --> 30:36.333
With that, I could buy
a couple of houses and a car.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.767
His rug's
starting to come loose.

30:38.833 --> 30:40.067
Fix it.

30:40.133 --> 30:41.700
Why don't you go
to RCA or Columbia

30:41.767 --> 30:43.467
and get them to pony up?

30:43.533 --> 30:47.533
We just need 5,000 down
and we can shop him all over.

30:47.600 --> 30:50.233
Oh, we just need
my 5,000, you mean?

30:50.300 --> 30:51.867
Plow that into my career.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.100
I'd be bigger
than the kid could ever be.

30:54.167 --> 30:55.367
Ready?

30:58.833 --> 31:00.600
Thank you.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.867
This is the opportunity
that is knocking.

31:02.933 --> 31:04.367
You're either in or out.

31:04.433 --> 31:06.533
-Don't threaten me.
-No threat.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.867
If you don't want
to be partners...

31:07.933 --> 31:08.900
I didn't say that.

31:08.967 --> 31:10.267
Then you're in
for the five Gs.

31:10.333 --> 31:11.333
I didn't say that.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.800
Put up or shut up.

31:13.867 --> 31:16.967
You tear up Presley's
contract, we're through.

31:19.100 --> 31:20.400
Fine by me!

31:20.467 --> 31:21.767
One final bit of free advice,

31:21.833 --> 31:24.300
and, you know,
the Colonel doesn't do free,

31:24.367 --> 31:26.967
-fix that damn toupee.

31:37.167 --> 31:39.867
Well played.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.433
Just so I understand...

31:54.500 --> 31:56.900
you married Jane?

31:56.967 --> 31:58.400
Uh-huh.

31:58.467 --> 32:01.067
And you're married
to Peggy, too?

32:01.067 --> 32:03.067
Uh-huh.

32:04.067 --> 32:06.633
And Jane's pregnant?

32:06.700 --> 32:09.133
Yeah, man,
I'm cooked, I got nothin'.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.967
Whoo!

32:12.433 --> 32:14.700
Well, you still got music.

32:14.767 --> 32:17.567
Yeah, and a lot of good
it's done me.

32:19.067 --> 32:22.300
Jerry Lee, you're about
as far from a saint

32:22.367 --> 32:24.700
as Ferriday to the moon
when it comes to women.

32:25.567 --> 32:27.500
But one thing I do know

32:27.567 --> 32:30.067
is when it comes to this here
piano...

32:31.400 --> 32:35.900
I ain't never seen
no one play like that.

32:38.067 --> 32:41.100
Your talent is nothing less
than a precious gift

32:41.167 --> 32:42.467
from the Lord!

32:49.400 --> 32:50.733
Can you just move over?

32:50.800 --> 32:54.333
Some of us got talent,
some of us got scrapin's.

33:01.567 --> 33:03.533
Yeah!

33:36.800 --> 33:40.533
Oh! You just poked
the devil in disguise!

33:40.600 --> 33:43.400
Hey, Dewey!
Come here, man. Come here.

33:43.467 --> 33:45.467
-Hey, come on!

33:45.533 --> 33:49.800
Go on, Dewey. Go on!
Go on! Come on!

33:59.700 --> 34:01.467
-Oh, Dad!

34:05.267 --> 34:06.600
Oh, gotcha.

34:08.400 --> 34:09.767
Look, I killed Dad.

34:09.833 --> 34:11.333
I see it. Shoot him again,
make sure he's dead.

34:12.533 --> 34:14.100
Come on,
I'll put your shoes on.

34:14.167 --> 34:15.600
All right.

34:15.667 --> 34:17.100
Trick or treating time.

34:17.167 --> 34:19.500
I'll take him, honey.
You should be at the office.

34:19.567 --> 34:21.433
What for?

34:21.500 --> 34:23.400
Well, RCA could be
calling you right now.

34:23.467 --> 34:24.867
They don't have
our home number.

34:24.933 --> 34:28.100
Oh, Colonel Doughboy has.
And believe you me,

34:28.167 --> 34:30.567
it would be ringing off the
hook if he got the money.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.733
Why take the chance?

34:32.800 --> 34:36.600
Sam, it is $40,000.

34:36.667 --> 34:39.533
Do you know what we could do
with that kind of money?

34:40.667 --> 34:42.100
I know you're disappointed.

34:42.167 --> 34:45.067
We could finally take
that honeymoon to Honolulu!

34:48.133 --> 34:49.333
Oh, for God's sake!

34:49.400 --> 34:51.467
Could you just, for once,
listen to me?

34:51.533 --> 34:52.733
Fine.

34:55.200 --> 34:57.933
Don't worry, Big Daddy.

34:58.067 --> 34:59.433
They'll phone.

35:00.633 --> 35:03.633
You know, I hate
to see you fret so much.

35:03.700 --> 35:06.133
Cat got your tongue?

35:06.200 --> 35:07.500
Meow.

35:11.133 --> 35:13.700
What's so great
about this kid, anyway?

35:13.767 --> 35:18.267
Mmm, Big Daddy has
so much on his mind.

35:18.333 --> 35:20.133
RCA will call.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.733
I just know it.

35:26.200 --> 35:29.633
If Marion Keisker
whispers in your ear,

35:29.700 --> 35:34.467
if I hear that
you turned down that money...

35:34.533 --> 35:37.067
I swear to you,
I swear to you...

35:37.067 --> 35:38.800
It is not funny!

35:39.700 --> 35:41.833
I swear to you, Sam.

35:46.267 --> 35:47.933
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:48.067 --> 35:52.600
please welcome John Cash

36:57.733 --> 37:00.867
You know, I think
I'm getting better.

37:05.367 --> 37:06.367
Dewey.

37:07.467 --> 37:08.667
Marion.

37:09.300 --> 37:10.567
Oh! Whew!

37:10.633 --> 37:12.700
Oh! Ah!

37:14.767 --> 37:17.667
That Marion is
a good-looking broad, boy.

37:19.167 --> 37:20.367
You know, man,

37:20.433 --> 37:22.933
if I didn't love my cuz
so much, I'd have...

37:25.767 --> 37:31.767
Sam is a lucky, lucky boy.
Mmm-mmm, good.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.700
Wait, are you implying
what I think you are?

37:38.667 --> 37:43.067
Oh, no, Earle. Earle.

37:43.067 --> 37:44.500
I wouldn't take
anything I said

37:44.567 --> 37:45.900
with a grain of salt

37:45.967 --> 37:48.400
or a pinch of pepper
or a shot of whatever

37:48.467 --> 37:49.833
the hell floats your boat.

37:51.867 --> 37:53.533
Earle. Earle!

37:53.600 --> 37:54.800
Yes!

37:56.667 --> 37:59.667
-We have to talk.
-Oh! Excuse me.

38:01.200 --> 38:04.267
I thought you promised to do
a lot more than talk.

38:07.100 --> 38:08.100
Whoo!

38:09.067 --> 38:10.467
I've just realized something

38:10.533 --> 38:13.167
that I probably should've
realized a long time ago.

38:14.100 --> 38:18.567
This... This isn't working.

38:18.633 --> 38:20.433
What's not working?

38:20.500 --> 38:22.733
Us. We're done.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.333
What? Why?

38:27.467 --> 38:28.767
Why?

38:28.833 --> 38:30.133
Oh, I don't know.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.733
It might have
a little something to do

38:31.800 --> 38:33.267
with you screwing Sam.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.633
Let me be clear, Earle.

38:42.700 --> 38:45.567
I've always been
in love with Sam,

38:45.633 --> 38:47.833
but it's got
its complications.

38:50.233 --> 38:53.533
I really tried
to make it work with you.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.367
But you know what?

38:56.867 --> 38:58.200
You're no Sam.

39:04.700 --> 39:07.067
You're fired.

39:10.967 --> 39:13.400
-Marion, Marion...
-He fired me.

39:13.467 --> 39:15.900
I didn't say...

39:23.333 --> 39:25.200
