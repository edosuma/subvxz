01:36.397 --> 01:43.302
         (grunts)

01:43.304 --> 01:46.438
     Christ compels you to leave
     this man in peace.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.373
                 Be gone, demon.

01:48.375 --> 01:51.276
     (grunts)
               Come on, be gone.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.814
                    Be gone!
   (screams, grunts)

01:55.816 --> 01:57.983
(grunting continues)

02:05.226 --> 02:06.492
         (screams)

02:06.494 --> 02:08.426
           It burns!

02:08.429 --> 02:10.395
    (screams)
            It's all right, son!

02:10.396 --> 02:11.997
                 It's all right!

02:11.999 --> 02:13.398
             (sobs)

02:13.400 --> 02:15.801
          It burns!

02:17.171 --> 02:19.004
(sobbing continues)

02:25.312 --> 02:26.645
It's all right.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.282
               It's gone.

02:30.284 --> 02:33.018
        It's gone. I can-- I can
        feel it going out of me

02:33.020 --> 02:36.555
    like... like Satan's fingers
    were squeezing my heart...

02:37.858 --> 02:39.324
               and then suddenly
               just let go.

02:41.095 --> 02:42.895
            Thank you, Reverend.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.398
               Praise Jesus.
               Thank you.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.903
        Bless you.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.851
             (breathing heavily)

03:05.853 --> 03:07.286
              (grunts)

03:08.856 --> 03:10.489
              (growls)

03:10.491 --> 03:13.458
  By the power of the Almighty,
  I cast you out.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.734
              (screams)

03:22.736 --> 03:24.303
               Take me!

03:24.305 --> 03:26.405
            Satan, take me!

03:26.407 --> 03:28.073
Cover yourself, harlot!
               Take me! Take me!

03:28.075 --> 03:29.708
                 ANDERSON:
                 Cover yourself!

03:31.745 --> 03:32.911
      (laughs maniacally)

03:32.913 --> 03:33.979
Cast this demon out!

03:33.981 --> 03:35.948
           (screams)

03:38.586 --> 03:39.985
  (screams)

03:39.987 --> 03:41.853
      Come out, demon! Come out!
       (screams)

03:41.855 --> 03:43.422
(screaming continues)

03:44.358 --> 03:46.058
                 Cast you out!
     (screams)

03:46.060 --> 03:47.759
            In the name of God,
(possessed people screaming)

03:47.761 --> 03:50.562
        the Son,
        the Lord Jesus Christ...

03:50.564 --> 03:52.197
         I command you, demon,
         leave this lady's body!

03:52.199 --> 03:53.432
           (screaming)

03:54.535 --> 03:56.068
         Praise Jesus.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.336
             Thank you.

03:57.338 --> 04:00.439
         (screams)
        Loosen the child's hold!

04:00.441 --> 04:02.074
                           Burn!
              No!

04:02.076 --> 04:03.208
      Burn the demon out of you!

04:03.210 --> 04:04.610
(possessed person screaming)

04:04.612 --> 04:06.878
            I command this demon
            in your body.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.113
             I cast you out!
        (screams)

04:08.115 --> 04:09.414
            (click)

04:19.360 --> 04:20.759

PATRICIA:
Hello?

04:48.889 --> 04:51.056
                  Hello?

04:51.058 --> 04:52.224
        (door rattles)

05:02.770 --> 05:03.869
                     Hi.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.071
Hi.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.309
What are you doing here?

05:11.412 --> 05:12.678
                  (exhales)

05:14.114 --> 05:15.147
    I'm sorry.

05:15.149 --> 05:18.283
Um, I've been working, and...

05:18.285 --> 05:19.785
    research.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.487
I didn't get much sleep.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.790
       Uh, is there something
       that I can help you with?

05:24.792 --> 05:27.392
No, no. It's, uh,
it's a personal project.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.228
There anything
I can do for you?

05:31.665 --> 05:33.131
            No, I just...

05:33.133 --> 05:35.834
     haven't seen you
     for a few days, so...

05:35.836 --> 05:38.537
  thought I'd come by, make sure
  everything is all right.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.539
   I'm fine.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.907
       I'm busy.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.844
              Because...

05:47.681 --> 05:50.816
       if you've been having
       second thoughts about...

05:50.818 --> 05:52.851
      taking this any further...

05:54.655 --> 05:56.355
         I'd like to know now.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.126
               (chuckles)

06:02.496 --> 06:04.062
     Come on, don't be silly.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.231
             If it's a bad idea,

06:06.233 --> 06:08.667
      let's just save
      each other a lot of grief.

06:08.669 --> 06:09.901
Patricia, um...

06:11.071 --> 06:12.404
I-- I got a lot to attend to.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.705
 I'll call you later.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.611
           Don't bother.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.855
          I learned more
          about my husband

06:29.857 --> 06:33.225
 after the accident cleaning out
 his locker at work...

06:34.862 --> 06:38.563
         going through
         the glove compartment
         of his truck...

06:38.565 --> 06:41.566
     than I did 17 years
     sharing a bed with him.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.938
    I'm not gonna do that again.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.182
     Come with me.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.455
                   (door closes)
      ANDERSON: Don't be afraid.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.595
(banging)

07:10.597 --> 07:12.798
       It's no secret what I do.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.269
Everybody knows
it needs to be done...

07:19.239 --> 07:22.340
but nobody really wants to see
what's behind the curtain.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.714
(banging)

07:31.485 --> 07:33.318
        Are you sure about this?

07:39.159 --> 07:40.392
          Yes.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.167
(man screaming)

08:00.314 --> 08:02.547
(screaming continues)

08:03.484 --> 08:05.317
PATRICIA:
Oh, my god!

08:19.299 --> 08:20.899
           Barnes, wake up.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.269
              Hey, get over here
              with the brush.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.209
            Now go on.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.847
     (chattering)

08:57.237 --> 08:58.870
                   LISA:
                   That's gross.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.138
               MARK:
               Tell me about it.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.873
       Ripped out from the root.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.242
       Must have hurt like hell.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.544
   Put that thing away

09:05.546 --> 09:07.212
before I puke
all over your desk.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.514
           So, you're telling me
           that's not yours?

09:09.516 --> 09:11.149
       Oh.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.218
I can get wild, Officer.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.555
I think I'd remember
losing a nail.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.989
            That's got your DNA.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.724
Well, if I had a nickel

09:19.726 --> 09:21.326
for every place
I left some DNA.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.329
   Look, some ugly shit happened
   where we found this.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.764
       I just want to know what.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.401
            Who was there,
            somebody got hurt...

09:29.403 --> 09:31.436
     Wouldn't know.
                 You're sure?

09:31.438 --> 09:33.204
              DNA doesn't lie.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.739
There are a lot of men
on death row

09:34.741 --> 09:36.908
might disagree with you.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.777
   All right, so there's nothing
   you can tell me

09:38.779 --> 09:41.012
             about an old camper
             in the woods,

09:41.014 --> 09:43.381
     a bunch of bloody carcasses
     nailed to trees?

09:43.383 --> 09:45.817
I'm not real outdoorsy.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.355
                Where did
                you disappear to
                last August?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.090
      I took a trip.
                     Where?

09:52.092 --> 09:53.692
     Disneyland.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.460
It's none
of your fuckin' business.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.128
     And you didn't tell anybody
     where you were goin'?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.797
                Left your car
                in the driveway,

09:58.799 --> 10:00.198
            didn't take a stitch
            of clothing,

10:00.200 --> 10:02.100
           not a wallet,
           credit card, nothin'?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.935
        Freaked your boyfriend
        out enough that he filed

10:03.937 --> 10:05.203
       a Missing Persons Report.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.810
                  What are you,
                  like 6'3, 6'4?

10:11.812 --> 10:15.280
         Gun in your holster,
         big dick in your pants?

10:15.282 --> 10:18.783
So, you can't imagine
how desperate

10:18.785 --> 10:19.818
                 and scared
                 you have to be

10:19.820 --> 10:21.319
               to leave your car
               and your clothes

10:21.321 --> 10:24.556
       so you can just disappear
       on your boyfriend.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.524
      Where were your cops then?

10:28.228 --> 10:29.728
Can I go?

10:31.665 --> 10:32.864
        Yeah.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.834
Thanks for the help.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.907
                (drawer opening)

10:43.977 --> 10:45.543
Is this how
it's supposed to be?

10:46.613 --> 10:48.647
             Shit!

10:48.649 --> 10:50.849
              Nothing's working.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.517
PATRICIA: The cross,
all the scripture reading,

10:52.519 --> 10:53.652
nothing's doing anything!

10:53.654 --> 10:55.186
          It feels it.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.322
      Every blessed word.

11:00.494 --> 11:01.693
    What are you doing?

11:14.374 --> 11:15.473
                  Fuck!

11:15.475 --> 11:17.142
(whispers)
Sweet Lord Jesus Christ.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.877
     It was the blood.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.612
    It must have been.

11:20.614 --> 11:22.647
It was the only thing
we did differently with Joshua,

11:22.649 --> 11:24.349
    and it worked for Kyle.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.217
Kyle? Kyle Barnes?

11:26.219 --> 11:28.453
Maybe I should go get him.
       No! Fuck him!

11:28.455 --> 11:30.155
  He thinks he's special.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.390
  That it's him
  the demons are feared of.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.893
I'm just scared
you're not gonna be able--
                     Then go.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.728
  Fear gives them strength,

11:36.730 --> 11:38.163
   and if that's
   what you bring here,

11:38.165 --> 11:39.431
     I don't need you!

11:45.972 --> 11:47.806
(man groans)

12:09.362 --> 12:10.995
                    (door opens)

12:35.021 --> 12:36.421
                         (sighs)

14:01.141 --> 14:02.540
   Who's there?

14:05.879 --> 14:08.646
 Patricia McCready.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.381
From the Light of God Church.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.950
We've met before.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.186
I need to talk to you.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.889
                      Well,

14:17.891 --> 14:20.925
             what are you doin'
             sittin' in your car
             in the dark?

14:23.029 --> 14:25.630
          I didn't wanna...
          bother you, I suppose.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.898
You scared of me?

14:26.900 --> 14:28.499
   (chuckles)

14:28.501 --> 14:30.869
Crazy Kyle Barnes?

14:30.871 --> 14:33.504
Rome's own Boo Radley?
Is that it?

14:33.506 --> 14:35.473
   I'm not afraid of you.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.077
  Not after what I saw today.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.651
          Reverend caught
          another live one, huh?

14:47.854 --> 14:49.387
He needs your help.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.260
      He won't ask for it.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.963
    He thinks he's bein' tested.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.334
             It's one thing
             to hear him talk
             about it on Sunday,

15:03.336 --> 15:04.869
              the "dark forces."

15:04.871 --> 15:09.007
               I never imagined
               what it'd be like
               face to face.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.541
Yeah, well,
he's the expert

15:10.543 --> 15:12.610
on all that,
so you're in good hands.

15:13.713 --> 15:14.979
       Goodnight.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.615
  What's the matter with you?

15:17.617 --> 15:19.717
     How can you just walk away?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.352
                We've heard
                what you can do!

15:21.354 --> 15:24.122
Lady, you want to see
what I can do?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.124
      Why don't you have
      the Reverend take you
      down to Charleston?

15:26.126 --> 15:28.092
There's a girl lying
in the ICU down there

15:28.094 --> 15:31.129
with tubes coming out of her
and a blank stare in her eyes.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.465
That's what I can do.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.867
           So you-- you're gonna
           hide in there?

15:35.869 --> 15:37.802
   Pretend this isn't happening?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.272
Better than makin' it worse.

15:43.877 --> 15:47.145
You all think
you know who I am.

15:47.147 --> 15:50.181
I'm the guy who beat
his wife and his daughter.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.621
   That ain't the half of it.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.089
            Know who you're not?

15:58.091 --> 15:59.457
                     Boo Radley.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.660
        Guess it's been a while
        since you read the book.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.797
        In the end, he turns out
        to be a hero.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.712
(bottle shatters)

16:24.784 --> 16:26.484
   WOMAN (on TV):
   Are you invested in gold?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.420
Are you a financial planner
with clients interested in gold?

16:29.422 --> 16:30.855
 Maybe you've considered gold,

16:30.857 --> 16:33.157
      but the commissions
      were just too high.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.661
                      (knocking)

16:37.797 --> 16:39.530
          MAN (on TV):
          Commissions?

16:39.532 --> 16:41.532
  I'm convinced
  the market's gonna crash!
           (knocking continues)

16:41.534 --> 16:43.835
   With the US dollar falling
   and inflation rising,

16:43.837 --> 16:45.803
     I've already converted
     considerable amounts

16:45.805 --> 16:47.672
        of my assets
        into gold.
            (knocking continues)

16:47.674 --> 16:50.308
WOMAN (on TV):
I remember the 70's
when gold went through the roof!

16:50.310 --> 16:52.110
           MAN (on TV):
           It's true.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.612
 Gold's the perfect investment
 for my son's future.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.114
        WOMAN (on TV):
        Now is the time

16:56.116 --> 16:57.882
      to own gold again.
            (knocking continues)

16:57.884 --> 17:01.052
   Gold savings accounts,
   gold investment accounts.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.954
       Gold IRA accounts.

17:02.956 --> 17:05.455
      U.S. coins,
      international coins,

17:05.458 --> 17:06.824
        certified coins.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.659
 Fiscal delivery and storage.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.496
 Call the International Gold
 and Silver Brokers Association

17:11.498 --> 17:14.565
     and receive the lowest
     possible payment.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.633
    (TV chatter continues)

17:38.224 --> 17:40.324
            (grunts)

17:40.326 --> 17:43.828
  MAN (on TV):
  Okay, shoppers,
  you know what that sound is.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.663
   It's our Bonus Buy sound.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.266
   Today only at the Worldwide
   Shopping Channel,
                        (grunts)

17:48.268 --> 17:50.168
      we have a beautiful,
      beautiful...

17:50.170 --> 17:52.270
              (breathes shakily)

17:52.272 --> 17:53.938
                           Uh...

17:55.842 --> 17:59.110
   What-- what--
                  Shh.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.112
           Save your breath.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.180
       (grunts)

18:02.182 --> 18:03.514
                  (inhales)

18:05.852 --> 18:07.285
        (grunts)

18:07.287 --> 18:10.088
         I'm sorry, sweetie.
(grunts)

18:10.090 --> 18:13.191
      You're not supposed to
      be just for me,

18:13.193 --> 18:15.593
                but I need this.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.798
(grunts)

18:26.272 --> 18:27.538
              Shh.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.110
                      (yelps)
  (grunts)

18:45.725 --> 18:47.158
             Grace.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.097
                     (sighs)

18:53.099 --> 18:55.433
                Dear Lord,
                bless this meal.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.235
         May the food nourish us

18:57.237 --> 18:59.303
          and may the fellowship
          enrich our lives.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.606
        Most of all,
        may we always invite you

19:01.608 --> 19:03.441
            into our home
            and into our hearts.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.409
                       Amen.

19:05.411 --> 19:06.844
             Amen.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.883
Where were you last night?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.453
   I dropped in on the reverend.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.021
        Offered him my services.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.956
 Yeah, I'll bet you did.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.958
                 Don't be crude.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.161
     You don't have to be
     so weird about it.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.862
   I know you're bangin'
   Old Balls.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.430
                 Aaron.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.933
     Are you gonna deny it?

19:29.969 --> 19:31.502
   Why are you always like this?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.871
  'Cause every time you meet
  somebody, you meet dicks.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.007
You invite them to dinner
and then you fuck 'em

19:36.009 --> 19:37.875
so they won't run away.
    That's enough.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.343
   But they always do anyway.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.945
           Right after they shit
           all over you.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.681
Do you like being like this?

19:43.683 --> 19:45.950
 Do you hate yourself that much?

19:49.155 --> 19:54.559
   Reverend Anderson is
   a good, kind, brave man.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.594
   He is not a dick.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.363
    Okay, you're right, Mom.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.598
             Sorry.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.869
Reverend Anderson isn't a dick.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.405
       In fact,
       he's the opposite
       of a dick.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.241
         He's a pussy.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.978
May I be excused,

20:13.980 --> 20:15.346
 or do you want to talk
 about the guy

20:15.348 --> 20:18.082
who nailed you
at your prom?

20:18.084 --> 20:20.084
    Well, that would have
    been your father.

20:21.921 --> 20:25.489
Six months, six days,

20:25.491 --> 20:27.925
then I'm 18
and I'm out of here forever.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.271
   MAN (on TV): And as you can
   see here, the cheese that
   will go on later.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.006
      I'll set that down.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.442
  And I have pre-prepped...

20:44.444 --> 20:46.210
              (gasps)

20:46.212 --> 20:47.912
 some of the other vegetables
 that I'll be putting
 in the salad.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.647
            (breathing shakily)
 (TV chatter continues)

21:03.896 --> 21:05.096
    (gasps)

21:49.809 --> 21:51.075
                    (clattering)

22:00.520 --> 22:02.253
      What are you doin'?

22:02.255 --> 22:03.654
                        Mornin'.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.023
    Low oil light came on.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.692
    You ignore the signs,
    the next thing you know,

22:07.694 --> 22:10.261
      you go up in flames,
      am I right?

22:10.263 --> 22:13.998
    I mean what are
    you doing here?

22:14.000 --> 22:17.001
   We buried Norville
   over three weeks ago.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.303
     Just packin' up his things.

22:19.305 --> 22:21.138
        You know,
        he didn't have
        any family.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.875
    Lived out here like a...
    like a hermit.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.345
    Place will probably go
    into probate eventually.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.613
      His whole life will end up
      in a dumpster.

22:31.617 --> 22:35.219
         Been nice,
         spending time out here,

22:35.221 --> 22:37.088
feeling his presence.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.029
You seen anybody else out here?

22:46.899 --> 22:48.566
           You all right, son?

22:48.568 --> 22:50.901
            You-- you want me to
            have a look at that?

22:52.905 --> 22:54.605
             Uh...

22:55.808 --> 22:57.742
I-- I'll take care of it.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.112
I gotta get to work.

23:05.718 --> 23:06.817
         (door closes)

23:18.765 --> 23:22.066
     See? He's fine.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.021
What are you doing here?

23:45.525 --> 23:48.592
           Well, you don't seem
           very happy to see me.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.428
         Especially after
         all we've been through.

23:51.697 --> 23:53.197
     You want to give me a ride?

23:53.199 --> 23:55.266
I explained this to you.

23:55.268 --> 23:57.268
We did what we did,
and now you move on.

23:57.270 --> 24:00.037
   Sometimes it's not that easy.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.705
That's not my problem.

24:01.707 --> 24:04.008
Now get out of here
before Kat sees you.

24:06.813 --> 24:07.878
                 Fine.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.147
          Just want to warn you,

24:10.149 --> 24:12.283
     cops know about the camper.

24:12.285 --> 24:13.918
They talked to you?

24:13.920 --> 24:15.085
Who was it? Giles?

24:15.087 --> 24:17.221
                 Younger cop.
                 Big guy.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.956
     Said I left some DNA in it.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.992
   I'm sure you did.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.762
Don't worry about the camper.
I already took care of it.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.530
    You take care of everything.

24:30.503 --> 24:31.836
             Fuck.

24:37.743 --> 24:40.277
              SIDNEY:
              Norville was a man
              who found purpose

24:40.279 --> 24:42.313
      in serving a higher cause.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.784
                Dedication.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.786
                 Selflessness.

24:48.788 --> 24:51.856
            Things that can give
            a life real meaning.

24:52.859 --> 24:55.025
 Things you obviously don't give

24:55.027 --> 24:56.827
a rat's ass about.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.631
                I'm-- I'm sorry.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.501
      You're not here
      to enjoy this world,

25:03.503 --> 25:05.169
            to have a good time.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.440
   Do you know how many
   you might have sacrificed

25:09.442 --> 25:10.875
    if I hadn't stopped you?

25:10.877 --> 25:12.877
           I was just trying
           to have a little fun.

25:12.879 --> 25:15.679
       I wouldn't have hurt him.

25:15.681 --> 25:19.517
It's nothin' compared to
what Reverend Anderson's doin'.

25:19.519 --> 25:22.152
            That man could cause
            a lot of harm.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.320
      Don't worry.

25:23.322 --> 25:24.655
  I'll deal with the reverend.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.190
  I know how his kind thinks.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.228
           What about me?

25:46.546 --> 25:48.112
           (car honks)

25:49.549 --> 25:50.648
                Keep goin'!

25:50.650 --> 25:52.383
      Go, go! Keep goin'!

25:56.656 --> 25:58.222
                 You wearing
                 your sunscreen?

25:59.692 --> 26:00.858
                 Yes.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.626
                           Liar.
                 Don't.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.898
   I see how hard you're tryin'.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.334
              Proud of you.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.504
Why are you saying that?

26:19.879 --> 26:23.047
I understand
you want to help, but...

26:23.049 --> 26:25.082
she don't want it.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.751
Not yet.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.258
Don't matter what happened.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.627
Amber's my daughter,
and I'm responsible.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.262
   And you're showin' them that,

26:38.264 --> 26:41.265
 but the rest of the world
 don't operate on your timeline.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.133
             Look, you're making
             good choices,

26:43.135 --> 26:44.668
     gettin' your life together.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.838
              Not hanging out
              with that revered.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.574
       That's over with.
       I told you.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.543
    I'm done with all that.

26:52.545 --> 26:53.944
                    Good.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.951
        Still, though...

27:02.154 --> 27:03.821
        don't you think
        there's things

27:03.823 --> 27:05.055
 that we don't understand yet?

27:05.057 --> 27:07.891
I know-- I know
it sounds crazy, but Megan,

27:07.893 --> 27:11.261
     I've seen things
     that I can't explain.

27:11.263 --> 27:14.365
          Yeah, it sounds crazy.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.801
(phone rings)

27:20.773 --> 27:22.373
Four-three-four?

27:23.576 --> 27:25.376
Don't know who that is.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.185
              I'll eat it later.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.154
      Okay.
     I'm gonna get back to work.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.622
    All right.

27:38.624 --> 27:41.492
   Thanks for the lovely picnic.

27:42.528 --> 27:44.995
You are such a fuckin' weirdo.

27:47.867 --> 27:50.034
          Hey.
     What?

27:50.036 --> 27:51.335
             Love you.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.569
   I know.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.073
(chuckles)
Love you, too.

27:58.444 --> 27:59.710
         (phone rings)

27:59.712 --> 28:01.945
      (ringing continues)

28:05.951 --> 28:08.252
      Hello, who is this?

28:13.626 --> 28:14.925
            Hm.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.530
        What's goin' on?

28:19.532 --> 28:21.198
               What do you mean?

28:23.335 --> 28:25.335
              Damn kids again.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.404
I've been trying
to call you all morning.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.306
   Thought you'd might
   like to know

28:29.308 --> 28:31.241
one of your flock's
gone wandering.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.943
Mildred Robson is missing.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.512
She's one of your...

28:35.514 --> 28:37.915
special cases,
wasn't she?

28:39.552 --> 28:40.784
       She still is.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.755
What do you mean?

28:44.757 --> 28:47.591
     It means the devil's still
     got a control of her.

28:47.593 --> 28:48.926
    Well, hold on.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.295
       H-- hold on, hold on now.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.232
             She may be as mean
             as a striped snake,

28:55.234 --> 28:58.335
   but that don't mean
   she's possessed by the devil.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.770
       You gave her an exorcism.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.338
        It didn't work.

29:02.374 --> 29:03.607
                 You sure?

29:03.609 --> 29:05.576
Course I'm fucking sure!

29:05.578 --> 29:07.244
         Well, are there others?

29:08.514 --> 29:10.414
        There are, aren't there?

29:10.416 --> 29:13.050
         Walkin' around town,
         sittin' in your church

29:13.052 --> 29:16.053
   with the devil inside of 'em.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.589
       I have followed your play
       for years.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.791
          Looked the other way,
          hushed things up,

29:20.793 --> 29:24.061
 all because people believe
 you were doing the Lord's work,

29:24.063 --> 29:26.263
        fightin' back the Devil.
What do you wanna hear?

29:27.233 --> 29:28.699
       That I'm a fraud?

29:28.701 --> 29:30.067
          A charlatan?

29:30.069 --> 29:32.236
      Get in fucking line!

29:32.238 --> 29:33.804
                     GILES: Le--

29:41.213 --> 29:43.547
      (overlapping chatter)

30:06.906 --> 30:08.305
                   (gasps)

30:26.792 --> 30:28.525
     You came.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.093
           (chuckles)

30:31.197 --> 30:33.297
(grunts) I thought
I didn't matter to you.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.165
                  Cut the crap.

30:35.167 --> 30:38.135
           Why don't you tell me
           what you want

30:38.137 --> 30:39.870
and what it has to do with Mark,

30:39.872 --> 30:42.072
           so I can get
           the fuck out of here?

30:45.544 --> 30:46.677
        You don't know.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.679
                  Know what?

30:48.681 --> 30:50.147
           (exhales)

30:50.149 --> 30:51.648
 Megan, your husband did this.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.684
           Bullshit. Bullshit.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.652
Look, Megan,
I was in town to sell tires.

30:55.654 --> 30:58.021
Honest to God,
that is all.

30:58.023 --> 31:01.525
     You asked me to go,
     and I was goin',

31:01.527 --> 31:04.294
      but now I have
      a doctor telling me

31:04.296 --> 31:05.829
   I might have brain damage

31:05.831 --> 31:09.333
and I might have seizures
for the rest of my life.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.634
              What do you want?

31:12.504 --> 31:16.340
There's two ways
that this can play out.

31:16.342 --> 31:21.378
Version one: Well, I had
a little too much to drink,

31:21.380 --> 31:24.548
  got into it with some locals
  in the parking lot,

31:24.550 --> 31:26.817
     and jeez, I just...

31:26.819 --> 31:30.187
   (chuckles)
   I could not get
   a good look at their face.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.189
End of story.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.691
Version two...

31:34.693 --> 31:36.894
well, version two
has me gettin' a lawyer

31:36.896 --> 31:38.929
and tellin' the truth
about what happened,

31:38.931 --> 31:42.232
and your husband goes to jail.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.902
Choice is all yours, Megan.

31:44.904 --> 31:48.572
Either way,
we're gonna have some fun.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.536
           (bubbling)

32:55.975 --> 32:58.442
            Where are you goin'?

32:58.444 --> 33:00.143
       I gotta go.
       Whoa, whoa, hold on, son.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.678
        We still got three hours
        of daylight left.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.447
         I took a chance on you!

33:03.449 --> 33:06.650
            I gave you a break
            when nobody in town
            would touch you!

33:07.586 --> 33:08.652
        (engine starts)

33:23.602 --> 33:26.937
   I know I said I was doing
   your work, Lord.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.445
     It's what I tried to say
     to my congregation.

33:37.649 --> 33:40.083
           It's what I tried
           to tell myself.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.055
       That I was called.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.693
    I didn't have a choice.

33:54.299 --> 33:56.133
(man screaming)

33:59.004 --> 34:00.604
         It's a lie, Lord.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.642
  I did it because I loved it.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.045
         The attention.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.815
          The praise.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.920
     The feeling of power.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.822
            Your power.

34:21.693 --> 34:24.561
    And if I offended you...

34:26.065 --> 34:27.164
           I'm sorry.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.270
And if this is my punishment...

34:35.607 --> 34:37.574
      I humbly accept it.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.677
(banging)

34:40.679 --> 34:42.746
MAN:
No!

34:42.748 --> 34:45.482
(grunts)

35:00.265 --> 35:01.865
Rev, open up!

35:02.935 --> 35:05.001
Gotta talk to ya!

35:08.273 --> 35:10.373
(banging)

35:24.456 --> 35:26.790
(man grunts)

35:26.792 --> 35:30.227
(screams)

35:31.797 --> 35:33.296
              KYLE:
              Reverend Anderson!

35:40.606 --> 35:42.005
I need to talk to ya.

35:42.007 --> 35:44.174
         I thought I was insane.

35:44.176 --> 35:46.409
    Isn't that what you told me?

35:46.411 --> 35:47.978
         God was laughing at me?

35:47.980 --> 35:49.679
     That is, if he even exists.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.481
 Come on, don't be an asshole.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.450
           (chuckles)
           Me being an asshole?

35:53.452 --> 35:55.018
             Mighty Kyle Barnes.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.853
         Hey--
            Who crawled back
            in his hole to hide!

35:56.855 --> 35:59.856
        But no, I'm the asshole,
        because I keep trying

35:59.858 --> 36:02.926
   even though my whole life now
   appears to be a fucking joke!

36:02.928 --> 36:05.795
(man grunts)

36:05.797 --> 36:07.664
     I-- I'm sure you got
     more important things to do

36:07.666 --> 36:09.032
       that don't involve
       giving a shit

36:09.034 --> 36:10.433
      about anybody
      other than yourself!

36:10.435 --> 36:11.501
 No, listen to me--
                    No.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.770
      Listen--
    No, you go on home! Go home!

36:13.772 --> 36:15.972
  Go stick your head in the sand
  or-- or up your own ass!

36:15.974 --> 36:18.441
                  Whatever!
That was the plan, Reverend,

36:18.443 --> 36:20.110
'til last night,
Mildred attacked me.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.447
          You mean attacked?

36:24.449 --> 36:26.016
       Last night.

36:26.018 --> 36:28.718
She would have killed me
if something hadn't stopped her.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.120
                 Something?

36:30.122 --> 36:32.022
      Or someone.
                    Who?

36:32.024 --> 36:33.857
(man screams)
(banging)

36:33.859 --> 36:36.059
     Reverend, who is that?

36:36.061 --> 36:37.794
          Is that her?

36:37.796 --> 36:39.196
 Do you have Mildred back there?

36:39.198 --> 36:40.897
         I don't--
         I don't need your help.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.832
I'm not offering.
    I don't need your help!

36:42.834 --> 36:44.668
     This is my test!
                Rev--

36:44.670 --> 36:45.702
                     My trial!

36:45.704 --> 36:46.736
                   (screams)

36:46.738 --> 36:47.971
            (grunts)

36:53.579 --> 36:54.711
              Don't let him out!

37:06.058 --> 37:07.757
            That's right, Caleb.

37:07.759 --> 37:10.160
           You look to the power
           of God's holy light.

37:10.162 --> 37:12.429
           He won't abandon you.

37:16.201 --> 37:18.034
     Caleb!
          Don't touch him, Kyle!

37:18.036 --> 37:19.669
Come on.
           Goddammit, he's mine!

37:24.676 --> 37:25.775
                   (screams)

38:12.090 --> 38:13.823
CALEB: (breathes heavily)

38:17.062 --> 38:19.696
         (sobs quietly)

38:53.865 --> 38:55.198
You were right.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.235
  I can't run away from this.

39:02.441 --> 39:05.775
     If I ever want to see
     my family again,

39:05.777 --> 39:08.445
     I gotta know that
     this isn't comin' for me.

39:10.315 --> 39:12.515
So, I say we go out
and fight it.

39:15.354 --> 39:17.554
I don't see that we have
much other choice.

39:20.325 --> 39:22.459
But we gotta be clear
on one thing.

39:25.364 --> 39:27.364
   In there on Sundays,

39:27.366 --> 39:28.798
you're in charge.

39:31.036 --> 39:33.803
If we're gonna
do this together,

39:33.805 --> 39:35.672
  we do it my way,

39:35.674 --> 39:37.574
or we don't do it at all.

39:50.856 --> 39:52.489
(door opens)

40:00.031 --> 40:01.631
How you feelin'?

40:03.001 --> 40:05.101
                      Uh...

40:05.103 --> 40:07.437
         I'm all right, I guess.

40:07.439 --> 40:08.972
                  A little sore.

40:10.742 --> 40:13.410
               Reverend, um,
               I don't even know
               where to start.

40:13.412 --> 40:14.844
                I'm so sorry.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.781
Why? Don't worry
about the mess.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.617
Make a fine visual aid

40:20.619 --> 40:24.120
for, uh, your story
on Sunday morning.

40:26.625 --> 40:30.427
 My brothers and sisters and me,

40:30.429 --> 40:34.864
   we were raised to believe
   that there's no worse torment

40:34.866 --> 40:36.800
              than being touched
              by the devil.

40:37.803 --> 40:39.936
    Well...

40:39.938 --> 40:41.871
you were raised up right.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.276
 But I didn't feel any torment.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.847
                 I felt...

40:52.484 --> 40:54.951
             I felt this warmth.

40:54.953 --> 40:58.154
       I figured it was
       just the sun, but then...

40:58.156 --> 41:00.757
    I felt like there was a hole

41:00.759 --> 41:03.827
          being drilled
          in the top of my head.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.897
               And the warmth...

41:07.899 --> 41:10.567
             poured into me
             through the hole

41:10.569 --> 41:12.335
              and filled up
              my whole body.

41:12.337 --> 41:14.337
That was the demon
taking over your body.

41:14.339 --> 41:16.239
            But I wasn't afraid.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.476
The devil was seducing you.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.078
That's how they work.

41:23.315 --> 41:25.515
                 Reverend...

41:25.517 --> 41:27.817
           I've been coming here

41:27.819 --> 41:30.086
                every Sunday
                my whole life,

41:30.088 --> 41:32.856
           because I was afraid.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.492
                Afraid of dyin'.

41:35.494 --> 41:38.261
        Afraid of goin' to hell.

41:38.263 --> 41:40.663
                  But this...

41:40.665 --> 41:42.432
             this did not feel

41:42.434 --> 41:44.133
          like something
          I should be afraid of.

41:44.135 --> 41:46.202
  Caleb, uh--

41:46.204 --> 41:47.604
                 I'm not saying

41:47.606 --> 41:50.373
       you aren't doing
       good work here, Reverend.

41:51.543 --> 41:52.709
        I can't get up there

41:52.711 --> 41:55.311
            on Sunday morning
            and tell these folks

41:55.313 --> 41:57.013
    that they need to be afraid.

41:58.650 --> 42:00.016
                Not anymore.

42:09.327 --> 42:10.927
            Thank you, Reverend.

42:57.943 --> 42:59.242
                         Hey!

43:11.957 --> 43:14.123
You and I gotta talk.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.299
       Shit.

43:27.739 --> 43:30.173
 GILES:
 You can take her on away now.

43:40.251 --> 43:43.052
              This isn't exactly
              on your way home.

43:45.290 --> 43:47.790
           I called 911.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.460
          Look, am I in trouble?

43:50.462 --> 43:51.995
           I was trying to do
           the right thing here.

43:51.997 --> 43:54.564
      Well, there's a first time
      for everything, I guess.

43:56.234 --> 43:57.467
           Can I go?

43:58.970 --> 44:01.571
           Our friend,
           the Reverend,

44:01.573 --> 44:04.440
       says that you have
       a particular knack

44:04.442 --> 44:06.709
           for this thing
           that he does.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.949
  She attacked me last night.

44:12.951 --> 44:14.283
               She attacked you?

44:14.285 --> 44:15.952
      She only weighs 90 pounds.

44:15.954 --> 44:17.854
      She's about 112 years old.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.590
      She was spry.

44:22.794 --> 44:24.360
She wanted something from me.

44:24.362 --> 44:25.495
   All of 'em do.

44:25.497 --> 44:27.063
                All of 'em?

44:28.133 --> 44:29.799
           Yeah.

44:29.801 --> 44:31.501
      Whatever your friend
      the Reverend's

44:31.503 --> 44:33.803
      been doing
      the last 20 years...

44:33.805 --> 44:36.039
       hadn't done shit.

44:36.041 --> 44:38.641
     I don't know
     where they come from

44:38.643 --> 44:40.710
   or what they want, but...

44:42.313 --> 44:44.580
    I know she's not
    the only one out there.

44:47.619 --> 44:48.918
            (sighs)

44:57.228 --> 44:58.394
         Hm.

45:22.654 --> 45:23.920
                  Huh.

45:28.593 --> 45:29.992
                (sighs)

46:00.024 --> 46:01.324
MARK:
Hey.

46:03.294 --> 46:04.761
          You're late.

46:04.763 --> 46:06.596
I know. Sorry.

46:07.565 --> 46:08.898
Some old lady's heart gives out

46:08.900 --> 46:11.634
and it's all hands on deck.

46:13.071 --> 46:15.371
         Don't. You'll wake her.

46:17.809 --> 46:19.475
Well, it's a little crowded.

46:19.477 --> 46:20.943
                      Leave her.

46:24.082 --> 46:25.548
         I like her here.

46:48.740 --> 46:50.473
              <i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

47:34.285 --> 47:35.618
(man clears throat)

47:41.059 --> 47:42.859
How did you get in here?

47:44.028 --> 47:46.729
        It's easy for me
        to go wherever I please.

47:50.401 --> 47:51.901
                    Who are you?

47:54.539 --> 47:56.572
   I saw the way
   you looked at me,

47:56.574 --> 47:59.342
        that day in your church.

47:59.344 --> 48:01.043
                    You knew.

48:01.045 --> 48:02.645
                Didn't you?

48:03.681 --> 48:07.817
        But you were just afraid
        to tell anybody.

48:07.819 --> 48:10.820
           They'd think
           you'd lost your mind.
           (chuckles)

48:10.822 --> 48:12.889
    You get out of my house.

48:12.891 --> 48:15.391
              I've seen what
              you've been doing,

48:15.393 --> 48:18.761
you and Kyle Barnes,
to my compatriots.

48:18.763 --> 48:19.929
            (grunts)

48:22.600 --> 48:24.166
It has to stop.

48:33.711 --> 48:35.745
ANDERSON: (screams)

48:52.931 --> 48:54.030
           (gasping)

48:55.733 --> 48:57.433
          Remember this warning.

49:05.443 --> 49:06.676
