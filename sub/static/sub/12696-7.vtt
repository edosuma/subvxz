00:07.567 --> 00:10.867
- [punching, thwacking
video game effects]

00:10.967 --> 00:13.000
- All right, guys,
we're finally gonna beat

00:13.100 --> 00:14.733
Sick Day II: The Sickening.

00:14.833 --> 00:18.067
- We've lost to that Pink Eye
dude like a hundred times.

00:18.167 --> 00:20.167
- I used to get real
live pink eye

00:20.267 --> 00:22.300
more than video game Pink Eye.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.167
- Oh, we're hitting him with
everything we've got.

00:24.267 --> 00:26.200
I think he's unbeatable.

00:26.300 --> 00:31.067
- MALE VIDEO GAME VOICE:
Ha. Ha. I am unbeatable.

00:31.167 --> 00:32.700
- I can't keep losing to some
villain named Pink Eye,

00:32.800 --> 00:35.100
I'm a super--

00:35.200 --> 00:38.067
fan of this game.

00:38.167 --> 00:39.933
There must be some kind
of design flaw.

00:40.033 --> 00:42.033
- No way. Some villains
just can't be beat.

00:42.133 --> 00:45.033
- I should know.
I'm a super--

00:45.133 --> 00:46.767
fan of this game, too.

00:46.867 --> 00:48.900
- There's gotta be some sort of
cheat code or something.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.467
- No way, dude, there's nothing.

00:50.567 --> 00:52.467
The only guy who knows
how to beat this game

00:52.567 --> 00:54.400
is the man who made it--
Cybron James.

00:54.500 --> 00:58.067
- I heard he lives in
a cave during the winter.

00:58.167 --> 00:59.500
Oh, wait, no.
That's a bear.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.467
Ah, I heard Cybron is gonna be
at GamerFest next week.

01:02.567 --> 01:04.333
- GamerFest has been
sold out for weeks.

01:04.433 --> 01:06.100
So, we've gotta keep trying.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.967
Come on, you know
what they say?

01:08.067 --> 01:09.833
- When you invite
your friends over,

01:09.933 --> 01:11.767
offer them something
to drink?

01:11.867 --> 01:14.667
- Drinks are for winners.
Attack!

01:14.767 --> 01:16.167
- [punching, thwacking
video game effects]

01:16.267 --> 01:18.933
- BILLY: Cool.
What are we doing?

01:21.233 --> 01:23.433
- Gettin' our game on.

01:23.533 --> 01:26.400
Okay, I'll send 'em up.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.767
Chloe wants you upstairs.
- Sounds urgent.

01:28.867 --> 01:31.233
- You guys are always sending
us to play with Chloe.

01:31.333 --> 01:32.967
We wanna hang out
with you guys.

01:33.067 --> 01:34.400
- Hey, that reminds me, bro.

01:34.500 --> 01:38.233
I have a lot of questions
about Chloe.

01:38.333 --> 01:43.233
I'm no baby doctor, but isn't
she big for a six

01:44.867 --> 01:48.200
- Thank you!

01:48.300 --> 01:51.633
- Don't worry, I'll keep him off
the whole superhero trail.

01:51.733 --> 01:55.967
Hey, Oyster, ever thought about
the Thundermans' last name?

01:56.067 --> 01:57.700
Well, don't.

01:59.533 --> 02:01.167
- Okay, guys, look,
you're right.

02:01.267 --> 02:02.700
I guess we haven't
been spending

02:02.800 --> 02:04.633
a lot of time with you lately,
so, how about this?

02:04.733 --> 02:06.567
Next weekend, we'll all
do something together.

02:06.667 --> 02:07.467
I'm busy.

02:07.567 --> 02:09.433
- We wanna go to
the waterpark.

02:09.533 --> 02:11.333
- All right, I was lying.
The waterpark sounds fun.

02:11.433 --> 02:13.267
- Perfect. Next weekend,
just the four of us.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.933
It'll be like old times.

02:15.067 --> 02:16.600
- I have another question.

02:16.700 --> 02:20.100
What's with all these man-shaped
holes in your ceiling?

02:20.200 --> 02:21.767
- We have cupcakes.
- Awesome!

02:21.867 --> 02:23.867
- MAX: I know.

02:23.967 --> 02:26.100
- *

02:26.200 --> 02:27.367
* What you see

02:27.467 --> 02:29.067
* Is not what you get

02:29.167 --> 02:32.167
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:32.267 --> 02:33.900
* We fit right in

02:34.067 --> 02:35.367
* Bet you never guessed

02:35.467 --> 02:36.900
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:37.067 --> 02:38.467
* Just like all the rest

02:38.567 --> 02:40.267
* A picture
perfect family *

02:40.367 --> 02:42.367
* Is what we try to be

02:42.467 --> 02:43.733
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:43.833 --> 02:45.367
* The crazy things we do

02:45.467 --> 02:47.067
* This isn't
make believe *

02:47.133 --> 02:48.800
* It's our reality

02:48.900 --> 02:50.233
* Just your average family

02:50.333 --> 02:53.300
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:53.400 --> 02:57.167
* Livin' a double life

02:59.833 --> 03:02.767
- *

03:04.667 --> 03:07.333
- Thunder monitor, I need
help defeating Pink Eye.

03:07.433 --> 03:09.567
- FEMALE MONITOR VOICE:
Initiating Pink Eye Treatment.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.700
- Oh!

03:11.800 --> 03:13.900
I meant Pink Eye
in the video game.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.200
That's what I get
for asking advice

03:17.300 --> 03:18.733
from an expensive doorbell.

03:18.833 --> 03:20.667
- All right, I've been
trying all week,

03:20.767 --> 03:24.533
and I finally scored four
tickets to today's GamerFest.

03:24.633 --> 03:25.900
Cherry and Oyster
are on the way over.

03:26.067 --> 03:28.100
We're
actually going to GamerFest?

03:28.200 --> 03:29.767
- Mm-hm.
- Wait.

03:29.867 --> 03:31.300
Why do I feel like
we're forgetting something?

03:31.400 --> 03:32.533
- What time are you guys

03:32.633 --> 03:34.233
leaving for the waterpark
with Billy and Nora?

03:34.333 --> 03:35.600
- There it is.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.433
You promised
them last week

03:37.533 --> 03:39.367
you'd take them
to the waterpark.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.200
- Yeah, but we promised
ourselves a minute ago

03:41.300 --> 03:42.833
that we would go
to GamerFest.

03:42.933 --> 03:45.367
Besides, Billy and Nora have
probably forgotten all about it.

03:45.467 --> 03:48.433
- Uh, I'm not
so sure about that.

03:50.867 --> 03:53.833
- Aw, I can't stand
seein' 'em like that.

03:57.233 --> 03:58.700
- Guys, they wanna hang out

03:58.800 --> 04:00.700
with their big brother
and sister.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.567
- This could be my only chance
to talk to Cybron James

04:02.667 --> 04:04.633
and learn how to
defeat Pink Eye.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.400
- How am I gonna beat
a real bad guy,

04:07.500 --> 04:09.133
when I can't even beat
a made up one?

04:09.233 --> 04:10.400
- And I need to introduce Cybron

04:10.500 --> 04:12.900
to his next great
video game villain.

04:13.067 --> 04:15.433
I based him on me.

04:15.533 --> 04:18.067
I just need to come up
with a cool name.

04:21.933 --> 04:25.233
- Jerkules! Jerkules!

04:25.333 --> 04:27.100
- You guys promised
Billy and Nora

04:27.200 --> 04:29.100
you'd spend the day with them.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.100
- So, if you wanna
go to GamerFest,

04:31.200 --> 04:32.667
just take them with you.

04:32.767 --> 04:35.333
- Not your best idea, Hank-o.

04:35.433 --> 04:37.333
- Or you can get grounded.

04:37.433 --> 04:39.667
- Well-played, Barb.

04:39.767 --> 04:41.400
- What are we gonna do
about Cherry and Oyster?

04:41.500 --> 04:43.600
- Don't worry, I'll break
it to 'em gently.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.067
- CHERRY & OYSTER:
GamerFest! GamerFest!

04:47.167 --> 04:48.500
- CHERRY: Look, a note.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.600
- This is horrible.

04:55.300 --> 04:56.967
"Moving back tomorrow."

04:57.067 --> 04:58.800
- Oh, sweet.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.400
- Oh, man, I keep
missing the pins.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.667
I guess Chloe wins again.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.833
- Victory lap!

05:11.700 --> 05:13.567
- Barb, you can't
just let Chloe win.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.433
Super kids need
to be challenged.

05:15.533 --> 05:17.067
You keep going easy on her,

05:17.133 --> 05:19.067
she'll never learn to
work hard at anything.

05:19.133 --> 05:22.067
- Oh, you're right,
but Chloe's my little baby

05:22.133 --> 05:23.833
and I'd feel so bad,
if I won.

05:23.933 --> 05:25.267
- Well, luckily,
I have no problems

05:25.367 --> 05:29.100
showing our kids
I am better than them.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.633
- Lap two!

05:30.733 --> 05:32.067
- Ha. Ha. I'm gonna
beat ya, Chloe.

05:32.167 --> 05:34.367
Ha. Ha. Ooh! Ooh!
Oh, toe cramp.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.133
Toe cramp.

05:36.233 --> 05:40.500
- *

05:40.600 --> 05:43.567
- [video game music,
sound effects]

05:43.667 --> 05:45.067
- Oh, we're actually here.

05:45.167 --> 05:46.600
Cybron James and the answer
to beating his game

05:46.700 --> 05:48.600
are only 100 people away.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.067
Make that 99.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.300
- We came here to have
fun with you guys,

05:57.400 --> 05:58.900
not stand in line all day.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.367
This is awesome.

06:01.467 --> 06:05.067
Look at us--standin'
in line. Woo!

06:05.133 --> 06:06.333
- Woo!

06:06.433 --> 06:08.733
Nope, this line's the worst.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.733
- Oh, hey, you wanted to
go to a waterpark, right?

06:10.833 --> 06:12.733
Well, I see a virtual
one right over there.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.533
Why don't you guys head over

06:14.633 --> 06:16.500
and we'll meet you there
when we're done.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.467
- Unless one of us sells a game
villain to Cybron.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.967
Then so long, suckas!

06:21.067 --> 06:23.533
- But we're supposed to
be having fun together.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.067
That's the whole point.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.800
- Well, we will. Later.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.667
Hey, we'll even buy
you some snow cones.

06:28.767 --> 06:30.733
- You can't buy us off,
right, Billy?

06:30.833 --> 06:32.267
- Wrap that snow cone
in funnel cake,

06:32.367 --> 06:34.100
and you've got
yourself a deal.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.233
- Billy! Oh!

06:40.700 --> 06:42.867
They really don't
wanna hang out with us.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.067
- Forget them.
We can still have fun.

06:47.733 --> 06:50.433
- Mine's too tight.
- Mine, too.

06:50.533 --> 06:53.933
- Help me and I'll
help you.

06:54.067 --> 06:55.933
- [glasses' elastic
bands snapping]

06:56.067 --> 06:57.933
- Whoa. Whoa. Are you okay
there, little guy?

06:58.067 --> 07:00.567
- I'm Fifi.
This is my twin brother Matt.

07:03.867 --> 07:06.333
- Kinda.

07:06.433 --> 07:09.667
- Here, let us help
you with those.

07:09.767 --> 07:11.067
Now all you have to do is

07:11.133 --> 07:12.967
touch the side of the goggles
to start it up.

07:13.067 --> 07:14.433
- NORA: Whoa!

07:14.533 --> 07:16.733
I'm on a waterslide!

07:16.833 --> 07:20.267
This is why I was born!

07:20.367 --> 07:21.867
- You guys are super fun.

07:21.967 --> 07:23.867
- I'm glad somebody thinks so.

07:23.967 --> 07:27.267
- This fake water
feels so real.

07:32.067 --> 07:33.633
- Hi-ya!

07:35.667 --> 07:38.800
- Nice try, Daddy.

07:38.900 --> 07:41.600
- She's trying to psych
me out, Barb.

07:41.700 --> 07:44.367
- This is your idea
of challenging her?

07:44.467 --> 07:47.267
Let Mama show her
how it's done.

07:51.967 --> 07:55.700
- Yay! My fourth victory lap.

07:58.267 --> 08:01.067
- COLOSSO: If you're tired
of losing to a child,

08:01.100 --> 08:03.700
I just happen to be
a bowling champion.

08:06.333 --> 08:09.600
- Yes, I was MVP of my Villain
League bowling team--

08:09.700 --> 08:13.367
The Bowl-hemian Rhapsodies.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.767
What's in it for you?

08:16.867 --> 08:19.933
- All I want is for Barb to read
me bedtime stories,

08:20.067 --> 08:21.933
while Hank checks
me for ticks.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.733
- No way.
- Never gonna happen, Colosso.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.067
- Let's check ya
for ticks, Coach.

08:34.100 --> 08:39.067
- *

08:39.100 --> 08:42.700
- It's like looking
into a gorgeous mirror.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.367
- Stop staring at
your Jerkules.

08:45.467 --> 08:47.700
- That's not his name.
- MAN: Next.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.433
- Uh, two wristbands for
the Cybron Experience, please?

08:50.533 --> 08:52.167
- Uh...no.

08:52.267 --> 08:53.700
- Uh...yeah.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.567
- Cybron is previewing
his new game Spitballs.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.067
It's for kids.

08:57.133 --> 08:59.067
You need to be accompanied
by a kid 13 or under.

08:59.167 --> 09:01.300
- Information we could
have used an hour ago.

09:04.067 --> 09:05.700
- That sign's pretty hidden.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.733
I'm not sure people
can see it.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.167
Where are we supposed
to find a coupla kids--

09:19.267 --> 09:20.767
Nora and What's-His-Face!

09:20.867 --> 09:23.233
- Billy.
- Billy.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.467
- Hey, guys, just in time.

09:24.567 --> 09:25.767
Come on over and get
your wristbands.

09:25.867 --> 09:28.200
- Cool! Four wristbands,
please?

09:28.300 --> 09:30.067
- It's happening, Phoebe.
We're goin' in.

09:30.133 --> 09:33.300
- Here you go.
- FIFI & MATT: Thanks.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.200
- This is embarrassing.

09:35.300 --> 09:38.533
Billy thinks this slightly less
handsome version of me is me.

09:40.233 --> 09:43.900
- We are going into the Cybron
Experience with Fifi and Matt.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.867
This poser with
the cool hair?

09:45.967 --> 09:47.700
- Hi, I'm--
- Can it, cool hair.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.867
- It's really nice
to meet you.

09:48.967 --> 09:50.800
- Zip it, pretty face.

09:50.900 --> 09:52.867
- They even were more of
a brother and sister to us

09:52.967 --> 09:55.300
in an hour than
you've been in months.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.733
We love you--

09:57.833 --> 09:59.867
- Nora.
- --Nora.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.567
- You guys can come
with us right now,

10:01.667 --> 10:04.733
if you have my
funnel-snow-cake.

10:04.833 --> 10:06.300
That's what I thought.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.600
Come on, guys.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.267
- Wait, wait,
wait a second.

10:10.367 --> 10:11.467
What are we supposed to do?

10:11.567 --> 10:15.400
- Have fun waiting
in line. Whee!

10:22.300 --> 10:33.033
- *

10:33.133 --> 10:34.933
- I can't believe
they ditched us.

10:35.033 --> 10:37.000
- I can--we've been pushing
them off on Chloe

10:37.100 --> 10:39.100
and now we've pushed
them off on two weirdos.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.167
Something about Matt's
face makes me sick.

10:41.267 --> 10:44.000
- I feel the same way about
Fifi and her pointy earlobes.

10:44.100 --> 10:48.533
- *

10:48.633 --> 10:50.000
- A new high score!

10:50.100 --> 10:52.733
- CROWD: [cheering,
applauding]

10:55.867 --> 10:57.333
- We really messed up.

10:57.433 --> 10:58.600
That should be us in there.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.067
- I know. I'm great
at double-Dutch.

11:00.133 --> 11:01.867
That high score
should be mine.

11:01.967 --> 11:03.433
- No, we should be
the ones in there

11:03.533 --> 11:04.700
having fun with
Billy and Nora,

11:04.800 --> 11:06.800
not cool hair and pretty face.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.533
We need to get in
there and apologize.

11:08.633 --> 11:09.967
- I don't know who
pretty face is.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.700
But sure, let's get
in there.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.467
I know just the way.

11:13.567 --> 11:17.700
- *

11:17.800 --> 11:19.900
- Come on, Maximus,
let's not dilly-dally.

11:20.067 --> 11:22.633
Two wristbands for me
and my son, please?

11:22.733 --> 11:24.400
- I am under 13.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.233
Oh! Uh...

11:32.800 --> 11:37.067
Look, Mommy,
my big boy legs grew in.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.833
- That's not my boy.
He must have gone inside.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.267
Maximus, Mommy's coming.

11:44.533 --> 11:47.067
- MAN: Nice try.

11:47.167 --> 11:49.867
- How are we supposed
to get wristbands?

11:53.400 --> 11:55.300
- Maybe we don't
need wristbands.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.933
Would you get off your knees.
People are staring.

11:57.067 --> 11:59.733
- It's such a genius idea.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.667
- Lesson one--
in order to knock down pins,

12:05.767 --> 12:08.800
you must think like pins.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.500
- Ow! Ow!

12:14.600 --> 12:17.267
How does he hit so hard with
his tiny little paws?

12:17.367 --> 12:19.067
- Ah!

12:19.167 --> 12:21.133
- COLOSSO: Bowling's not
for the weak.

12:21.233 --> 12:25.700
If you wanna win,
prove it, gutter balls.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.633
- Ah! Ah! Colosso,
are you biting me?

12:28.733 --> 12:30.433
- A little bit, yeah.

12:30.533 --> 12:33.633
- Ah! Ow! Ow!

12:33.733 --> 12:36.600
- Okay, this doesn't
seem safe.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.533
- COLOSSO: If it's safe,
it's not bowling!

12:38.633 --> 12:40.067
Now throw the balls!

12:43.767 --> 12:46.567
- This is where you run!
- BARB: Oh!

12:46.667 --> 12:49.333
- BARB: Hank!

12:53.867 --> 12:55.500
- I told you my plan
would work.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.767
- I know. It's working great.

12:56.867 --> 12:58.467
I'm charging ten bucks
a picture.

12:58.567 --> 13:00.067
- You're giving
me half, right?

13:00.167 --> 13:01.967
- Sure. Right after
we talk to--

13:02.067 --> 13:03.767
- --Billy and Nora.
- --Cybron.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.067
- Can't we talk
to Cybron first?

13:05.167 --> 13:07.167
- No, we have to apologize
to Billy and Nora.

13:09.767 --> 13:12.500
- PHOEBE: Oh, Billy, Nora.
- NORA: Security!

13:12.600 --> 13:14.400
- Relax, it's us.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.700
- We know. Security!

13:16.800 --> 13:18.800
- Look, we're sorry.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.900
- Yeah, sorry you couldn't
use us to get in here.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.400
- We don't wanna hang out
with you guys anymore.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.967
Matt and Fifi hooked us up.

13:26.067 --> 13:27.767
We get to play a live action

13:27.867 --> 13:30.533
version of Cybron's new
game--Spitballs.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.400
- See ya.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.100
- Well, we tried our best.
If you need me, that's too bad.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.733
I'll be busy
talking to Cybron.

13:36.833 --> 13:37.900
- Max--

13:38.067 --> 13:41.133
- Hey, we were
looking for you.

13:41.233 --> 13:42.600
Cybron wants everyone
in position.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.567
We're about to
start Spitballs.

13:44.667 --> 13:47.067
- Right--because I work here.

13:47.167 --> 13:49.267
Remind me, what's
my position again?

13:49.367 --> 13:52.100
- Guard the walls so the little
kids we found don't escape.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.500
Why would they need to escape?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.633
- How do you know
their names?

13:56.733 --> 13:58.700
- Oh, that's just what
I call all kids.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.767
Move it along,
Billys and Noras.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.533
The game is rigged
so they can't win.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.600
- Look, just make
sure they don't get out.

14:09.067 --> 14:10.667
- Here they come.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.900
- Poor suckers.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.533
They were easy targets

14:17.633 --> 14:19.733
after their brother
and sister abandoned them.

14:19.833 --> 14:23.367
- Uh, abandon's a bit
of a strong word--

14:23.467 --> 14:26.067
said the employee who needs
to get to her station.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.367
Out of my way,
Billys and Noras.

14:33.867 --> 14:36.167
- I'm ashamed to be
your coach.

14:36.267 --> 14:38.767
She's gonna hit this
pin and you'll lose--

14:38.867 --> 14:40.600
like the losers you are.

14:45.133 --> 14:48.533
You won!
I never lost faith.

14:48.633 --> 14:50.267
- Even though you didn't win,

14:50.367 --> 14:53.700
you tried your best and that's
what's important, okay?

14:53.800 --> 14:55.100
- And it was fun.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.633
- Aw.
- That's my baby girl!

15:01.900 --> 15:03.167
- It's not your fault, kid.

15:03.267 --> 15:06.367
With me as their coach,
you didn't have a chance.

15:06.467 --> 15:07.700
- I let them win.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.067
Now they're happy. Look.

15:10.167 --> 15:12.267
- HANK: We crushed her!

15:12.367 --> 15:14.667
- BARB: Baby girl got served!

15:16.267 --> 15:18.833
- There's no way
you let them win.

15:18.933 --> 15:21.100
Just man up
and admit you choked.

15:28.933 --> 15:30.467
You did not just do that.

15:30.567 --> 15:32.667
- Believe it, baby.

15:42.100 --> 15:45.833
- Welcome, my adoring
Cybronites.

15:45.933 --> 15:48.533
- CROWD: [cheering,
applauding]

15:52.433 --> 15:54.700
- Cybron James
presents to you

15:54.800 --> 15:57.500
his latest masterpiece--

15:57.600 --> 15:59.900
Spitballs!

16:02.300 --> 16:04.767
- Hit the target.
Capture the flag.

16:04.867 --> 16:07.867
Win the game.
Get hit with spit.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.800
And bear the ultimate shame.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.800
Bring forth the spits!

16:17.167 --> 16:18.533
- Guys, the game is rigged.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.167
- I don't know.
I wasn't at the meeting.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.600
- CROWD: Ohhhh...

16:31.733 --> 16:33.333
- Billy!

16:36.400 --> 16:38.467
- Let's show 'em
what we've got.

16:38.567 --> 16:41.767
- *

16:44.233 --> 16:45.933
- Let's go! Come on!

16:46.067 --> 16:48.133
- *

16:49.933 --> 16:51.833
- Who are you that
you speak to Cybron

16:51.933 --> 16:54.067
as though you are
his equal?

16:54.100 --> 16:55.167
- Uh, the name's Max

16:55.267 --> 16:57.067
and I'm a big fan
of your work.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.700
Soon you'll be
a big fan of mine.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.733
I give you...

17:02.833 --> 17:04.933
Kevin!

17:05.067 --> 17:08.167
- Surrender your sketch.

17:08.267 --> 17:09.733
Amateur at best.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.667
But Cybron sees promise.

17:12.767 --> 17:14.233
I spent months--

17:14.333 --> 17:17.233
- Cybron grows tired
of your face.

17:18.933 --> 17:21.700
Uh-uh, Cybron did
not dismiss you.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.267
Continue to linger as
he considers your work.

17:25.367 --> 17:28.367
And you gaze upon his.

17:30.700 --> 17:36.833
- *

17:36.933 --> 17:38.700
- NORA: This is awesome!

17:38.800 --> 17:40.667
We're about to win!

17:40.767 --> 17:42.633
It doesn't make any sense.

17:42.733 --> 17:43.967
- It makes a lot of sense.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.800
- Let's just end this.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.433
- You did it!

17:59.533 --> 18:01.267
- Now we just have
to get the flag.

18:05.433 --> 18:07.533
- Why does winning
look like losing?

18:07.633 --> 18:09.800
Ahhhhh!

18:19.067 --> 18:20.700
How are they supposed
to win now?

18:20.800 --> 18:23.267
- They aren't.
Cybron's games are unbeatable.

18:23.367 --> 18:27.800
That's what keeps people playing
and Cybron filthy rich.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.867
- That's diabolical.

18:29.967 --> 18:32.700
This pleases Max.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.067
- Don't.

18:34.133 --> 18:36.733
That's Cybron's thing.

18:36.833 --> 18:38.500
Feast your eyes on this.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.433
Cybron's marketing
is also unbeatable.

18:41.533 --> 18:42.867
Observe.

18:42.967 --> 18:44.567
These frightened losers

18:44.667 --> 18:48.333
will be on the cover
of every Spitballs game box.

18:48.433 --> 18:49.767
- But they'll be humiliated.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.133
- Precisely.

18:51.233 --> 18:54.800
Oh, laugh with Cybron.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.867
You're not laughing.

18:56.967 --> 19:00.300
- Max is reclaiming
his sketch.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.567
That's right, Max is using
the weird name thing now.

19:03.667 --> 19:05.933
And the weird laugh thing.

19:10.133 --> 19:12.100
- We need help!

19:12.200 --> 19:15.933
- Matt, Fifi, we need help!

19:16.067 --> 19:18.367
- We've been set up.

19:18.467 --> 19:20.800
- Matt, Fifi,
we've been set up!

19:23.733 --> 19:26.667
- Phoebe was right.
It's rigged.

19:26.767 --> 19:28.867
Let's get outta here.

19:30.967 --> 19:33.200
Retreat!

19:35.333 --> 19:37.600
- He may have a second cannon,
but they have me.

19:47.067 --> 19:49.833
- Look, Phoebe's blocking
the spitballs for us.

19:49.933 --> 19:51.767
- There's too many of them.

19:58.933 --> 20:00.267
What are you doing here?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.200
- No one humiliates Max's
brother and sister except Max.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.967
So what's the plan?

20:04.067 --> 20:05.600
- I think we have a chance,

20:05.700 --> 20:07.567
if we can make those cannons
take each other out.

20:17.367 --> 20:19.100
- There's gonna be
spit everywhere.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.400
- PHOEBE: Billy, Nora,
run for it!

20:26.500 --> 20:28.400
- CYBRON: Uh-uh.

20:38.967 --> 20:43.300
- Cry with Cybron.

20:45.467 --> 20:48.233
- BILLY: I'll take that.

20:48.333 --> 20:51.533
- CROWD: [cheering,
applauding, whistling]

20:54.900 --> 20:55.967
- PHOEBE: We're with them.

20:56.067 --> 20:57.567
We're their brother
and sister.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.567
- That's right--
ten bucks a photo

20:59.667 --> 21:01.633
with the only people who've
ever defeated Cybron.

21:01.733 --> 21:03.967
- Oh, so now we're fun enough
to hang out with.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.733
- You always were.

21:05.833 --> 21:08.600
We just got so caught up in
doing our own stuff, we forgot.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.500
And we're sorry, right, Max?
- Right.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.433
You guys are way
more important

21:13.533 --> 21:16.067
than selling my villain to
Cybron for crazy gamer money.

21:16.167 --> 21:18.267
Holy spitballs,
what have I done?

21:20.067 --> 21:21.433
- Come on, drop the act.

21:21.533 --> 21:24.067
This is the most fun
the four of us have ever had.

21:24.133 --> 21:25.400
You two pretending
not to like us

21:25.500 --> 21:28.133
and hiring Matt and Fifi
to set us up in that game

21:28.233 --> 21:30.400
so you two could come
to our rescue.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.767
Best birthday ever!

21:35.267 --> 21:37.233
- Uh, yeah, yeah,
happy birthday.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.467
- Let's go get you
some birthday cake.

21:39.567 --> 21:41.600
- BILLY: Yeah,
let's start with that.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.600
- It's not your birthday.
- I know.

21:43.700 --> 21:46.300
But right now they're
feeling so guilty,

21:46.400 --> 21:49.333
we can milk them for
everything they've got.

21:49.433 --> 21:53.400
- I'm thinking season passes
to the waterpark.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.733
Smart plan.
- Thank you.

21:55.833 --> 21:57.400
I took a spitball
to the back of the head.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.100
Now I feel a lot smarter.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.167
- I think I like
this new Billy.

22:01.267 --> 22:02.600
- Thank you.

22:02.700 --> 22:04.067
I took a spitball
to the back of the head.

22:04.167 --> 22:06.733
Now I feel a lot smarter.

22:10.800 --> 22:26.500
- *
