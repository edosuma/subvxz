00:29.646 --> 00:32.206
You know, it belonged
to Alexander the Great.

00:32.381 --> 00:35.374
They say the design symbolizes
strength and courage.

00:35.551 --> 00:38.577
Can't exactly see myself going into battle
with that on my chest.

00:38.755 --> 00:42.748
Darker times call for darker methods.
His opponents thought he was invincible.

00:42.926 --> 00:46.054
- I didn't know you were a history buff.
- I'm not. I'm interested in people...

00:46.229 --> 00:50.632
- ... who ruled the world before they were 30.
- Don't worry, Lex, you have a few years.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.768
Lana, I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

00:53.836 --> 00:54.996
Didn't Lex tell you?

00:56.239 --> 00:58.230
Must've slipped my mind.

00:59.442 --> 01:02.070
Why don't I leave you two alone?

01:03.346 --> 01:05.507
Having fun?

01:05.682 --> 01:08.515
Yeah, well, I'm feeling
a bit underdressed.

01:08.685 --> 01:12.519
If it makes you feel any better,
Whitney is just as uncomfortable.

01:14.023 --> 01:15.923
Whitney came too.

01:16.092 --> 01:20.358
Why don't you join us? I'm gonna yank Nell
away from the jewelry exhibit so we can eat.

01:20.530 --> 01:22.691
Yeah, sure.

01:33.543 --> 01:35.704
Clark, where are you going?

01:35.878 --> 01:37.971
I'm gonna get some air.

01:38.147 --> 01:41.776
You know, you're never gonna get her
if you keep running away from your enemy.

01:42.051 --> 01:43.541
Whitney's not my enemy.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.747
Yes, he is. And the sooner you realize that,
the sooner you'll find a way to win Lana.

01:47.924 --> 01:50.722
Remember, keep your friends close
and the quarterback closer.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.054
Always the hopeless romantic, Lex.

01:53.963 --> 01:55.225
Victoria?

01:55.398 --> 01:58.128
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

01:58.568 --> 02:03.062
Clark Kent, this is Victoria Hardwick,
a very old friend.

02:03.239 --> 02:04.433
Hi.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.403
Champagne?

02:06.576 --> 02:08.737
How close are you gonna keep her?

02:08.911 --> 02:11.744
I'll catch up with you later, Clark.

02:16.252 --> 02:17.617
Want a private tour?

02:18.087 --> 02:19.679
I thought you'd never ask.

02:28.097 --> 02:32.727
You see this? I'm the only reason
you're not in a cage right now.

02:32.902 --> 02:35.837
Now you get into the IA,
and you get me those files.

02:36.005 --> 02:37.472
Why, is one of them yours?

02:39.509 --> 02:44.503
You've got 24 hours to get creative.
Start thinking.

02:48.351 --> 02:51.286
Well, welcome to Metropolis.

02:57.794 --> 03:00.126
More or less.

05:26.509 --> 05:28.773
Dad, let me help you.

05:35.685 --> 05:37.949
Don't break a sweat.

05:38.621 --> 05:41.146
So, night owl, how was Metropolis?

05:41.324 --> 05:42.757
- Fine.
- Come on...

05:42.925 --> 05:45.325
...a reception at the Metropolis Museum,
and it was fine?

05:45.494 --> 05:48.486
The museum was amazing.
It's just...

05:48.664 --> 05:50.029
It's just what?

05:51.133 --> 05:52.623
Something happened.

05:55.372 --> 05:58.800
It could've been worse. I stopped
the bus before anyone was hurt.

05:58.975 --> 06:01.341
- Clark, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

06:01.510 --> 06:04.809
- What if somebody'd seen you do it?
- Everyone was still in the museum.

06:04.981 --> 06:08.041
I think it's fine. There's no mention
of witnesses in the paper.

06:09.051 --> 06:11.110
I'd better get to school.

06:13.155 --> 06:17.148
Hey, Clark, look, I am real proud
of what you did.

06:17.326 --> 06:19.351
We both are.

06:35.011 --> 06:36.911
Did you bring them?

06:37.680 --> 06:39.511
You know I'm not supposed to do this.

06:39.682 --> 06:42.207
And I'm not the one with the DUl
on my record.

06:42.385 --> 06:44.546
You wouldn't believe
how many rent-a-cops...

06:44.720 --> 06:49.350
...forget to fill out the previous
criminal-record section on their job apps.

07:11.213 --> 07:14.205
So, what do you think of Smallville?

07:14.383 --> 07:18.217
It reminds me of the village
where my grandparents live in Wales.

07:18.387 --> 07:22.380
Very quaint. Very safe.

07:22.558 --> 07:26.358
And the last place I expected
to find Lex Luthor.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.123
My father'll bring me back
to Metropolis in a few years.

07:29.298 --> 07:31.391
- He's lying.
- I know.

07:31.567 --> 07:33.364
You deserve something better.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.970
And you crossed the pond
to tell me what that is.

07:36.138 --> 07:38.629
Catching up with an old friend
isn't reason enough?

07:38.808 --> 07:41.242
As much as I'd like to flatter myself...

07:41.410 --> 07:44.971
...the daughters of multinational
industrialists usually don't...

07:45.147 --> 07:48.639
...fly around the world
to rekindle old flames.

07:48.818 --> 07:51.252
Neither do executive vice presidents.

07:51.420 --> 07:54.253
- Then you've heard.
- That you're working for your father?

07:54.423 --> 07:57.551
I keep up. How is Sir Harry?

07:58.427 --> 08:02.124
Distant, inaccessible and rich.

08:02.298 --> 08:05.096
- I believe you know the type.
- What's he want with me?

08:05.267 --> 08:10.398
He understands you may have certain
negative feelings towards your father.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.633
Sir Harry has always had
an incredible grasp of the obvious.

08:13.809 --> 08:17.745
He was hoping those feelings might work
to our mutual advantage.

08:17.913 --> 08:21.508
He'd like you to reconsider
your position with LuthorCorp.

08:21.684 --> 08:23.914
So he sent you here as an incentive.

08:24.954 --> 08:26.478
I've missed you, Lex.

08:27.123 --> 08:29.614
I'm touched.

08:30.126 --> 08:31.616
Do you have a proposal?

08:33.129 --> 08:38.294
First, I think I'd like something else.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.968
- Another scathing editorial?
- Is there any other kind?

08:46.142 --> 08:49.134
Clark, what happened to you last night?

08:49.311 --> 08:53.304
I wasn't feeling well.
Guess I'm not much of a city guy.

08:53.482 --> 08:58.385
You can take the boy off the farm,
but you can't take the farm out of the boy.

08:58.654 --> 09:02.987
Sullivan, is this your idea of a joke?

09:03.292 --> 09:06.386
- Parents have been calling all morning.
- What are you telling them?

09:06.562 --> 09:09.497
What the EPA and other
environmental groups said years ago:

09:09.665 --> 09:11.155
The meteor rocks are harmless.

09:11.333 --> 09:14.393
People should know about
the strange things happening in this town!

09:14.570 --> 09:17.801
<i>The Torch is a school paper.
It's not your own personal tabloid.</i>

09:17.973 --> 09:19.133
Are you censoring me?

09:19.308 --> 09:23.836
I'm requiring you to do your job, which is
to report on relevant school events:

09:24.013 --> 09:28.040
Sports. Dances. Clubs.
I'm relieving you of your duties.

09:28.517 --> 09:31.577
<i>The Torch is suspended
until I can appoint a new editor.</i>

09:36.025 --> 09:38.858
- Okay, what just happened?
- I think you were fired.

09:40.229 --> 09:42.026
Chloe, I'm sure we can do something.

09:42.198 --> 09:43.563
Let me talk to Kwan.

09:43.732 --> 09:46.166
Not to sound ungrateful,
but what can you do?

09:46.335 --> 09:48.235
I don't know, but let me give it a shot.

09:57.713 --> 10:00.273
Afternoon, Lex.

10:01.550 --> 10:04.280
Or is it Mr. Luthor here in Smallville?

10:05.054 --> 10:06.248
Phelan...

10:06.422 --> 10:09.550
...isn't Smallville a couple of counties
outside your jurisdiction?

10:09.725 --> 10:13.786
Well, I don't need jurisdiction
to look up an old friend.

10:13.963 --> 10:15.726
We were never friends.

10:16.131 --> 10:19.100
If you want to see me, call my office.

10:19.268 --> 10:22.396
- When does it happen, Lex?
- When does what happen?

10:22.571 --> 10:24.698
When do you turn on the people
that help you?

10:25.074 --> 10:27.941
How many times did I pull you back
from the edge?

10:28.110 --> 10:30.101
You'd be dead right now
if it wasn't for me.

10:30.279 --> 10:33.908
You were on my father's payroll,
his go-to guy in the department.

10:34.083 --> 10:37.917
You got paid to fix situations, so don't
try and pretend it was anything else.

10:38.087 --> 10:39.918
You have a good life here, Lex.

10:40.089 --> 10:42.421
I'd sure hate to see that get compromised.

10:43.092 --> 10:45.560
You can't touch me, and you know it.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.923
I'm looking for a witness.

10:48.097 --> 10:51.157
I think he saw last night's accident
outside the museum.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.925
And this concerns me why?

10:57.106 --> 10:58.971
Sorry, I don't know who that is.

11:00.776 --> 11:02.266
I'd have pegged you for buddies.

11:02.444 --> 11:06.642
Guess you're losing your instinct.
Maybe you should think about retiring.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.019
Hello?

11:21.130 --> 11:23.121
Hello?

11:25.968 --> 11:28.129
Anybody home?

11:35.311 --> 11:37.074
Dad?

11:37.379 --> 11:39.370
Is that you?

11:53.329 --> 11:56.389
Metropolis Police.

12:07.409 --> 12:10.276
Kid, I don't know
what they've been feeding you...

12:10.446 --> 12:12.880
...but that was pretty impressive.

12:13.048 --> 12:16.540
Not quite as exciting as last night,
but I wanted to be sure.

12:17.186 --> 12:18.414
Who are you?

12:18.587 --> 12:21.681
I am your new best friend, Clark.

12:23.592 --> 12:24.684
How do you know my name?

12:24.860 --> 12:26.020
I asked around.

12:26.195 --> 12:31.030
That's the beauty of a small town,
everybody's just so eager to help.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.664
Far cry from Metropolis.

12:34.103 --> 12:36.503
- What do you want with me?
- Your help.

12:37.439 --> 12:40.931
You see, Clark, I'm in a battle
that I can't afford to lose...

12:41.110 --> 12:44.568
...because if I do, well, the bad guys win.

12:44.747 --> 12:48.615
And you have this gift that I need.

12:50.052 --> 12:51.576
I'll never help you.

12:56.225 --> 12:59.456
You have a secret you don't want
the world to know about.

12:59.828 --> 13:03.423
I'm guessing that's why you didn't stick
around for the TV cameras last night.

13:03.732 --> 13:08.294
You want to keep things that way,
you'll do like I say.

13:10.639 --> 13:13.233
Drop by that overpriced coffee shop
tomorrow afternoon...

13:13.409 --> 13:16.708
...and we'll talk about your future.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.142
Nice catch.

13:29.759 --> 13:32.922
So he just dropped the generator
right on top of you?

13:33.095 --> 13:36.087
How did he know it wouldn't kill you?

13:37.600 --> 13:39.192
He saw me stop the bus last night.

13:40.603 --> 13:42.628
Maybe we should call the police.

13:42.805 --> 13:45.933
He is the police. I saw his badge.

13:46.108 --> 13:47.473
Metropolis P.D.

13:50.947 --> 13:53.006
Dad.

13:58.287 --> 14:00.050
I didn't mean for this to happen.

14:00.223 --> 14:02.487
Clark, you didn't do anything wrong, okay?

14:06.128 --> 14:08.961
He told me to meet him
at the Beanery tomorrow.

14:09.131 --> 14:11.793
I don't want you going
anywhere near this guy.

14:11.968 --> 14:14.903
I'll talk to him,
and I'll find out what he wants.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.060
Until then-

14:16.239 --> 14:18.969
Until then, you live your life,
you see your friends.

14:19.642 --> 14:21.701
Now, we're not gonna let
this thing change us.

14:38.828 --> 14:41.296
You look like you're carrying
the weight of the world.

14:41.464 --> 14:45.491
I'm sorry if I surprised you,
but there's really nowhere to knock.

14:45.901 --> 14:50.167
It's okay. Thanks again for last night.

14:51.173 --> 14:55.007
Your first visit to Metropolis, and you're
involved in a police investigation?

14:56.512 --> 14:58.104
That has to be some kind of record.

14:58.281 --> 15:01.375
- How'd you know about that?
- The detective came to see me first.

15:01.550 --> 15:02.539
What'd he tell you?

15:02.718 --> 15:04.549
Not much.

15:05.288 --> 15:06.915
Maybe that's what's bothering me.

15:07.223 --> 15:08.212
What do you mean?

15:08.391 --> 15:13.454
Metropolis Police usually don't send
detectives to investigate traffic accidents.

15:13.629 --> 15:19.363
So I made a call. Turns out the official
investigation is already closed.

15:20.536 --> 15:23.630
Clark, you really don't want
Sam Phelan in your life.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.940
You know him.

15:26.375 --> 15:27.399
Unfortunately.

15:27.576 --> 15:30.704
I had my share of legal problems
while I was in Metropolis.

15:30.880 --> 15:34.043
- Serious?
- Expensive.

15:34.216 --> 15:37.652
Phelan was the kind of officer
my father felt we could turn to for help.

15:37.820 --> 15:38.912
He's a dirty cop.

15:39.088 --> 15:41.556
He'll do whatever it takes
to get the job done.

15:41.724 --> 15:45.216
Plant evidence. Falsify reports.
Anything is fair game.

15:45.394 --> 15:48.795
And if he's got something on you,
Clark, he'll use it.

15:49.398 --> 15:51.628
He just wanted to talk.

15:51.801 --> 15:53.598
Then you've got nothing to worry about.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.733
Hey, Mr. Kent.

16:01.310 --> 16:03.175
Mr. Kent?

16:03.579 --> 16:05.774
Sam Phelan, Metropolis P.D.

16:06.649 --> 16:08.640
I figured you'd be the one to show.

16:08.818 --> 16:11.082
- What do you want?
- We're both rational adults.

16:11.253 --> 16:13.915
- Let's sit down, talk-
- I don't think a rational adult...

16:14.090 --> 16:17.321
...drops a generator on top
of a teenage boy, do you?

16:17.493 --> 16:19.859
Well, we both know it wouldn't hurt him.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.607
All right, what do you want?

16:33.776 --> 16:35.505
I just want Clark's help.

16:35.678 --> 16:36.838
With what?

16:37.012 --> 16:40.607
Look around you, Mr. Kent.
You know what you see?

16:40.783 --> 16:45.015
The veneer of safety. Now, people like me
are sworn to protect that.

16:45.187 --> 16:49.351
I'm the guy standing between the criminals
and respectable citizens like yourself.

16:49.525 --> 16:54.622
Now, Clark has a gift...

16:54.797 --> 16:59.131
...and I would like to use his talents
to further my cause.

17:00.136 --> 17:03.902
I will not let you exploit my son.

17:05.974 --> 17:09.342
I've spent the morning going
through the local police files.

17:10.813 --> 17:13.781
Clark's name comes up quite a bit.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.213
Clark has never been in trouble
a day in his life.

17:16.385 --> 17:21.152
No arrests, but he's been
around a lot of crime scenes.

17:21.323 --> 17:23.314
Now, maybe that's coincidence...

17:23.492 --> 17:27.656
...or maybe it's just his natural instinct
to get involved.

17:34.003 --> 17:39.236
Okay, I will give you whatever you want.
You just stay away from my family.

17:43.679 --> 17:45.044
I want your son.

17:47.082 --> 17:48.413
No.

17:52.855 --> 17:54.720
I'll be in touch.

17:59.695 --> 18:04.257
Of course, if you don't agree,
I will tell the world what I know.

18:04.433 --> 18:09.530
Best case, Clark's under a microscope.
Worst case, he's a freak in a jar.

18:09.705 --> 18:14.039
Either way, his normal life is over.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.309
Do not push me!

18:18.481 --> 18:21.211
Easy there, Mr. Kent.

18:27.957 --> 18:30.391
We were just talking.

18:31.627 --> 18:34.596
You know, if I were you,
I'd learn to keep that temper in check.

18:34.763 --> 18:37.391
It could get you in a lot of trouble.

18:48.744 --> 18:51.907
Hey, Clark, you okay?

18:52.081 --> 18:54.982
Fine, just doing a little research.

18:55.150 --> 18:57.380
Have you heard about
Lana's meeting with Kwan?

18:57.553 --> 18:58.986
Chloe, I'm sure it'll work out.

18:59.255 --> 19:00.847
Hey.

19:01.023 --> 19:04.754
- So how'd it go?
- Well, it's interesting.

19:04.927 --> 19:06.918
When can we send out the next issue?

19:07.096 --> 19:08.927
Day after tomorrow.

19:09.098 --> 19:10.122
Cool.

19:10.299 --> 19:12.267
Except...

19:12.501 --> 19:15.265
...Kwan made me the new editor.

19:18.440 --> 19:23.104
Okay, rewind. I need you to say
that last part again.

19:23.279 --> 19:26.305
After I made my case, Kwan said
that if I had that much passion...

19:26.482 --> 19:28.848
...I should be in charge.

19:30.819 --> 19:31.945
I don't believe this!

19:32.121 --> 19:34.055
It's the only way he'd reopen the paper.

19:34.356 --> 19:36.085
So, what? Cheerleading's not enough?

19:36.258 --> 19:39.819
Maybe the editor of a school newspaper
looks better on a college application.

19:40.129 --> 19:42.290
That isn't it! I figured
you could ghostwrite...

19:42.464 --> 19:45.365
- ... until we got you reinstated.
- So then I would work for you.

19:45.534 --> 19:48.298
- The paper would still be yours.
- Wait, wait.

19:48.470 --> 19:50.495
Chloe, think about it. It's not a bad idea.

19:52.207 --> 19:53.799
It figures you'd side with her.

19:53.976 --> 19:55.375
- I'm not taking sides.
- Right.

19:55.544 --> 19:58.707
You're completely objective
in all things Lana.

20:00.983 --> 20:03.213
- Gotta go.
- No, please, Clark, stay!

20:03.485 --> 20:05.316
- Take my desk!
- Chloe...

20:05.487 --> 20:08.820
- ... this isn't what you think.
- You know what the weirdest part is?

20:08.991 --> 20:12.552
For a millisecond, I almost thought
you were my friend.

20:27.509 --> 20:28.703
Get in, kid.

20:34.717 --> 20:37.083
- What do you want?
- Your father came to see me.

20:37.252 --> 20:40.585
He seemed like a really good man,
always putting his family first.

20:41.423 --> 20:44.950
You know, if I were you,
I'd start thinking like him.

20:48.864 --> 20:52.095
I assume you've had a chance to read
my father's proposal.

20:52.267 --> 20:53.757
I didn't have to.

20:55.237 --> 20:58.206
So you've added mind reading
to your many abilities.

20:58.374 --> 21:00.535
I know why you're here, Victoria.

21:00.709 --> 21:04.372
Sir Harry wants to take over LuthorCorp,
and he needs my shares to do it.

21:04.546 --> 21:07.913
Your father didn't dream up
this little plan, did he?

21:10.052 --> 21:12.213
Do you think if you take over LuthorCorp...

21:12.388 --> 21:15.653
...Daddy will finally give you
the respect you deserve?

21:15.824 --> 21:17.382
He won't, Victoria.

21:17.559 --> 21:18.890
So, what are you suggesting?

21:19.228 --> 21:22.391
You came to play on
my hatred of my father.

21:22.564 --> 21:24.429
Now I'm going to play on yours.

21:24.600 --> 21:28.297
Why take one company,
when you can take two?

21:28.737 --> 21:30.637
You know they'd probably kill us.

21:30.806 --> 21:32.398
Probably.

21:32.941 --> 21:35.910
But that's what makes
life interesting.

22:01.437 --> 22:02.529
What are we doing here?

22:02.705 --> 22:05.435
You want to know the biggest obstacle
to my job, Clark?

22:05.607 --> 22:08.508
It's not the perps. It's the bureaucracy.

22:09.178 --> 22:12.545
How am I supposed to fight crime
with one hand tied behind my back?

22:12.715 --> 22:14.512
You said we were going after bad guys.

22:14.683 --> 22:18.517
We are. They're called Internal Affairs.

22:18.954 --> 22:21.388
In fact, the head of the IA division...

22:21.557 --> 22:24.958
...lives right up there on the fifth floor.

22:27.796 --> 22:29.286
I'm not gonna hurt anybody!

22:29.465 --> 22:32.400
Relax, you're just gonna help me
retrieve some files.

22:32.634 --> 22:37.469
See, these IA types, they have
a real trust problem.

22:37.639 --> 22:42.474
Well, it turns out the deputy chief keeps
all his most sensitive case files at home.

22:42.644 --> 22:46.307
The man's got a safe, so you find it.
You open it...

22:46.482 --> 22:49.212
...and you bring me whatever's inside.

22:49.485 --> 22:53.353
You do this one thing for me,
and I'll never trouble you again.

22:54.656 --> 22:57.716
I know what you're about, Phelan.
Lex Luthor told me.

22:58.327 --> 23:03.993
Yeah, well, your friend Lex isn't exactly
on the side of the angels.

23:04.233 --> 23:07.498
He's got his secrets, just like you.

23:08.337 --> 23:10.100
It's apartment 517.

24:02.457 --> 24:04.448
Hey, Phelan!

24:07.796 --> 24:09.764
Want your file?

24:10.732 --> 24:13.064
It's all yours.

24:14.303 --> 24:16.737
Did you call them?

24:17.639 --> 24:21.575
You're making a big mistake, kid.

24:37.159 --> 24:38.820
Morning, guys.

24:38.994 --> 24:42.486
What time did you get in last night?
I didn't hear you.

24:42.664 --> 24:44.222
Late.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.924
I was helping Lana at the Torch.

24:47.102 --> 24:49.332
I sort of lost track of time.

24:49.504 --> 24:52.564
Clark, has Phelan tried to contact you?

24:52.741 --> 24:56.142
Dad, don't worry, I think
he's out of our lives forever.

24:59.848 --> 25:02.078
Ethan, Bob...

25:02.251 --> 25:04.048
...what's going on?

25:04.219 --> 25:06.619
We got a warrant.

25:07.789 --> 25:10.280
It's a warrant to search
your property, Jonathan.

25:10.459 --> 25:12.791
A warrant? Come on in.

25:14.229 --> 25:15.787
What for?

25:15.964 --> 25:18.558
We got a tip from Metropolis P.D.

25:20.469 --> 25:23.097
You'd better come and take a look at this.

25:32.814 --> 25:35.374
Looks like he was shot in the heart.

25:37.819 --> 25:40.481
You wanna explain what a dead body's
doing in your barn?

25:40.656 --> 25:44.683
- I've never seen that man before.
- Ethan, we found this...

25:44.860 --> 25:48.159
...hidden under the seat in the truck.

25:48.897 --> 25:51.866
That is not my gun,
and I have no idea how it got in my truck.

25:52.034 --> 25:54.434
I'm sorry, but we
have to place you under arrest.

25:54.603 --> 25:55.729
Dad.

25:55.904 --> 25:57.838
It's all right.

25:58.006 --> 26:01.498
Call Bill Ross and have him
meet me at the jail.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.411
You're not taking him!

26:06.581 --> 26:11.712
Clark. Clark, I need you to stay here.

26:12.854 --> 26:15.049
And I need you to be strong.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.862
I'll follow in the car.

26:43.785 --> 26:46.845
That's what you get for trying
to be a hero, Clark.

26:47.222 --> 26:50.953
You're a pretty smart boy,
but you forget...

26:51.126 --> 26:54.061
...I've been doing this a long time.

26:54.229 --> 26:56.163
- Who's that man?
- Did you really think...

26:56.331 --> 27:01.997
...that you could double-cross me?
Clark, my job is about scenarios.

27:02.170 --> 27:04.229
You never enter a crack house
with one plan.

27:04.406 --> 27:08.240
You go in with 10.
That's how you survive.

27:08.410 --> 27:12.904
The truth is, kid, you didn't leave me
with a lot of options!

27:13.081 --> 27:15.242
- I want my dad out of jail.
- You complicate my life?

27:15.417 --> 27:17.851
I'm gonna complicate yours!

27:18.020 --> 27:20.045
Call them now and tell them what you did!

27:21.823 --> 27:24.883
What is it, Clark? You wanna kill me?

27:25.260 --> 27:28.423
You think that's the answer
to your problems?

27:28.597 --> 27:29.757
I want him out!

27:29.931 --> 27:32.422
Well, then, we both want something...

27:32.601 --> 27:36.537
...only you have a lot more to lose.

27:44.346 --> 27:47.645
I don't want any more surprises.

27:48.283 --> 27:51.218
I'm gonna let you think about last night.

27:57.025 --> 27:59.823
Stay close. I'll be in touch.

28:18.146 --> 28:20.273
Clark, what are you doing here?

28:21.049 --> 28:23.210
Hiding out.

28:24.319 --> 28:27.345
I heard about your dad.
I know it isn't true.

28:29.224 --> 28:30.316
Thanks.

28:33.161 --> 28:34.651
How are you doing?

28:34.830 --> 28:37.924
To be honest, I'm in way over my head.

28:38.500 --> 28:42.459
All I wanted to do is help Chloe, and
now I feel like I've screwed up everything.

28:44.306 --> 28:46.968
Guess that's what you get
when you try to be a hero.

28:48.677 --> 28:50.042
I know the feeling.

28:52.747 --> 28:56.513
You ever think your aunt's life would be
simpler if she hadn't adopted you?

28:57.519 --> 28:58.816
Clark, what's going on?

29:02.090 --> 29:05.287
Just seems like all I ever do is
complicate my parents' lives.

29:06.428 --> 29:10.194
You can't blame yourself
for what's happening with your dad.

29:10.565 --> 29:13.033
Every family goes through rough times.

29:13.201 --> 29:16.432
When I was 10,
I tried to run away to Metropolis.

29:16.605 --> 29:19.369
Nell found me at the bus stop.
It was freezing.

29:19.608 --> 29:23.305
As she was driving me home,
I asked her if she regretted adopting me.

29:23.945 --> 29:27.210
She stopped the car.
I remember because it started snowing.

29:27.549 --> 29:30.279
She looked me in the eye.

29:30.785 --> 29:34.050
She said it was the best thing
she had ever done.

29:34.222 --> 29:37.885
She didn't love me any less
because I was adopted...

29:38.059 --> 29:40.823
...but she worried about me more.

29:44.232 --> 29:45.665
I've gotta go.

29:47.402 --> 29:49.632
Don't worry, Clark.

29:50.071 --> 29:51.595
It'll all work out.

30:00.315 --> 30:03.409
Right here.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.560
Hi, son. Where's your mother?

30:21.736 --> 30:24.102
The police are questioning her.

30:26.675 --> 30:27.869
I lied to you.

30:29.945 --> 30:33.278
- What do you mean?
- I did see Phelan again.

30:38.119 --> 30:39.677
When?

30:39.854 --> 30:43.312
Last night. I went with him to Metropolis.

30:43.491 --> 30:47.951
I broke into an apartment,
found a safe with confidential files.

30:48.296 --> 30:49.456
Oh, Clark.

30:49.631 --> 30:50.928
I didn't have a choice.

30:51.099 --> 30:54.432
That's what he wanted you to think,
but you always have a choice.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.127
I was protecting you and Mom.

30:56.304 --> 31:00.468
You can not protect your mother and I
by lying to us. Come on!

31:02.811 --> 31:05.041
Dad, there's more.

31:06.147 --> 31:09.241
Phelan came back after you were arrested.

31:09.718 --> 31:13.586
I got so angry that I grabbed him...

31:13.888 --> 31:17.051
...and for a second, I wanted to-

31:20.161 --> 31:21.685
I wanted to kill him.

31:24.499 --> 31:26.262
But you didn't, right?

31:26.735 --> 31:28.965
Yeah, but I was close.

31:39.281 --> 31:42.773
Believe me, son, I know all there is
to know about losing your temper.

31:43.251 --> 31:45.515
But you can't afford to do it.

31:46.087 --> 31:50.251
This is Phelan's game,
and he will play your fear and your anger.

31:50.425 --> 31:52.518
But you cannot let him get to you.

31:52.694 --> 31:55.595
I don't care. I won't let anybody hurt
you and Mom.

31:55.764 --> 31:57.356
And he knows that.

31:58.033 --> 32:01.366
But once you've crossed that line,
there's no going back.

32:18.053 --> 32:21.887
Clark, I just heard about your dad.
Is he all right?

32:22.057 --> 32:23.046
He's hanging in there.

32:23.391 --> 32:26.554
This is crazy.
Your father didn't kill anyone.

32:26.728 --> 32:29.561
Give me five minutes, I'll get
the 10 best lawyers in the state.

32:29.731 --> 32:31.756
I don't think lawyers are gonna help.

32:33.802 --> 32:35.030
It's Phelan, isn't it?

32:36.471 --> 32:41.465
- What's he got on you, Clark?
- Just stay out of it, all right? Please.

32:42.644 --> 32:44.111
Listen to me.

32:44.412 --> 32:47.438
You may think you know
how Phelan works, but you'd be wrong.

32:47.615 --> 32:49.105
Sounds like you're an expert.

32:49.284 --> 32:53.243
- I understand his world.
- Yeah, he told me you have secrets.

32:56.157 --> 32:58.921
There are parts of my life
I'm not proud of, Clark...

32:59.094 --> 33:01.585
...but I don't want to see you
or your family hurt.

33:01.763 --> 33:03.424
Now, let me help.

33:03.598 --> 33:05.964
You can't, Lex.

33:07.435 --> 33:10.165
I gotta handle this on my own.

33:27.021 --> 33:28.215
You busy, Clark?

33:30.692 --> 33:33.217
- What do you want from me?
- That's complicated.

33:33.395 --> 33:36.694
After last night, I've got
Internal Affairs asking me...

33:36.865 --> 33:38.799
...more questions than I want to answer.

33:38.967 --> 33:39.991
That's your problem!

33:40.168 --> 33:42.796
No, it's our problem.

33:43.705 --> 33:46.572
But our next bit of business
is gonna be our last.

33:46.741 --> 33:49.869
Look, I don't care.
You can tell the whole world about me.

33:54.215 --> 33:58.311
Clark, you may not care about yourself,
but think about your parents.

33:58.720 --> 34:01.621
Now, your father's in jail
on a murder charge.

34:01.790 --> 34:06.489
And whether he beats it or not, he's
gonna lose this farm just paying legal fees.

34:06.661 --> 34:09.891
I can still make all that go away.

34:11.666 --> 34:13.360
So, what's it gonna be?

34:44.699 --> 34:46.428
What are we doing here?

34:46.601 --> 34:50.230
Since I couldn't pick up
my Internal Affairs records...

34:51.539 --> 34:55.100
...I figured it was time to pick up
my retirement package.

34:56.110 --> 34:59.273
The breastplate. You want me
to steal it for you.

34:59.447 --> 35:01.540
I don't give a damn about the breastplate.

35:01.716 --> 35:05.550
I just want the 10 million dollars
worth of jewels that are on it.

35:08.389 --> 35:09.651
Come on.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.857
So we're just gonna bust in?

35:14.028 --> 35:18.965
Not quite. Metropolis P.D. keeps blueprints
on the high-security buildings in the city...

35:19.133 --> 35:21.226
...so I know this place better
than the architect.

35:21.402 --> 35:24.963
The security system all runs
through this junction box.

35:26.407 --> 35:28.875
- Open it up.
- Isn't it alarmed?

35:29.244 --> 35:32.441
They only alarm things they think
somebody could get through.

35:35.250 --> 35:37.741
And, Clark, I'm getting pretty bored
with this.

35:37.919 --> 35:40.217
You want your old life back, you do it.

35:57.772 --> 36:00.400
Camera's are one thing.
What about the guards?

36:01.442 --> 36:04.275
They're about to get real busy.

36:05.780 --> 36:09.341
Yeah, Metropolis Museum? You have
two minutes to leave the building.

36:09.517 --> 36:11.747
There's a bomb outside.

36:24.132 --> 36:25.224
There's a bomb out here!

36:31.205 --> 36:33.901
Cameras are all dead in Luthor Hall.

36:57.498 --> 37:01.559
Kid, show me the magic.

37:23.358 --> 37:26.418
Standing by. Standing by.

37:38.039 --> 37:42.203
We are gonna make a great team.

37:57.225 --> 37:59.125
We'll never be a team.

38:12.740 --> 38:16.471
You might be able to explain the safe,
but your prints are all over that breastplate.

38:16.644 --> 38:21.081
You might be strong,
but you're not bulletproof!

39:10.465 --> 39:13.525
What are you?

39:14.769 --> 39:15.963
In there!

39:17.638 --> 39:19.367
Get down! Get down!

39:29.484 --> 39:32.282
Phelan, where's Clark?
I know he came with you.

39:34.222 --> 39:36.019
Just tell me what you had on him.

39:39.627 --> 39:43.324
Go to hell, Luthor.

39:57.378 --> 39:59.437
All the charges have been dropped.

40:00.848 --> 40:03.715
With apologies from the state
and Metropolis Police departments.

40:03.884 --> 40:05.715
Then it's finally over.

40:05.886 --> 40:07.376
Well, this time.

40:07.555 --> 40:10.752
Unfortunately, there's more than
one Phelan out there in the world.

40:10.925 --> 40:12.290
What do we do next time?

40:12.460 --> 40:14.553
I don't know, son.

40:14.729 --> 40:16.959
We'll have to deal with it
when the time comes.

40:17.131 --> 40:20.225
Maybe I should stop using my gifts.
That would solve our problems.

40:20.401 --> 40:22.062
No, it wouldn't, Clark.

40:22.236 --> 40:26.297
Your gifts are who you are.
You can't live in fear.

40:26.474 --> 40:28.635
Although a little caution wouldn't hurt.

40:34.081 --> 40:38.040
Clark, are you sure
nobody saw you last night?

40:38.586 --> 40:40.486
I'm positive, Mom.

40:52.933 --> 40:56.494
Miss Lang, what's this?

40:58.239 --> 41:01.231
- It's a news story.
- It's totally unacceptable.

41:01.409 --> 41:03.468
Why? It covers all of your criteria.

41:03.644 --> 41:06.112
It deals with a student
and a school-sponsored club...

41:06.280 --> 41:08.908
...and there are no mutants in sight.

41:09.617 --> 41:12.643
Did you do this because you thought
I'd reinstate Miss Sullivan?

41:12.820 --> 41:15.288
I did this
because it's the right thing to do.

41:15.456 --> 41:17.185
Chloe was born for this job.

41:17.358 --> 41:20.452
Although I do admire her passion,
her reporting lacks accuracy.

41:20.628 --> 41:23.119
I can work on that.

41:24.298 --> 41:28.325
If you want your job back, Miss Sullivan,
don't print what you can't prove.

41:28.502 --> 41:31.528
- Do we have a deal?
- Yeah. Thank you, Principal Kwan.

41:33.207 --> 41:36.802
Don't thank me. Thank Miss Lang.

41:43.384 --> 41:45.818
Congratulations. You deserve it.

41:45.986 --> 41:47.544
Thanks.

41:47.721 --> 41:51.179
You know, Lana, I'm sorry I flipped out
at you the other day.

41:51.358 --> 41:54.657
I just- You know, the paper's
kind of my identity...

41:54.829 --> 41:57.229
...and it's the only thing
Clark and I do together.

41:57.398 --> 41:58.990
And so when I saw you here-

41:59.333 --> 42:02.825
You thought I was trying
to cut Clark out of your life?

42:03.003 --> 42:04.732
Nobody ever said I was rational.

42:06.006 --> 42:08.941
I want to be friends with you, Chloe...

42:09.110 --> 42:11.476
...but I don't want to stand
between you and Clark.

42:12.413 --> 42:17.009
Oh, no. Don't worry,
there's nothing between us.

42:17.184 --> 42:19.015
We're just good friends.

42:21.522 --> 42:22.682
How about you?

42:23.757 --> 42:27.557
Same thing. We're just friends.

42:29.530 --> 42:32.192
Good. I'm glad we got that out of the way.

42:32.366 --> 42:38.032
Now, let's see what you've messed up
since I've been gone.

42:54.388 --> 42:57.789
Lex, are you gonna come to bed?

42:57.958 --> 43:00.119
In a minute.

43:01.305 --> 43:07.198
