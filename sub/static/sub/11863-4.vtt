04:08.836 --> 04:10.979
Do you want something to drink?

04:13.874 --> 04:15.864
Water? Coffee?

04:18.879 --> 04:20.512
Drano?

04:25.386 --> 04:27.864
Holiday dance is tomorrow night.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.973
Fundraiser for the new library.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.364
I take it you don't give a
shit about the new library.

04:39.983 --> 04:42.568
Uh-huh. Ahem.

04:47.221 --> 04:49.075
I want to ask you a favor.

04:49.945 --> 04:51.091
Just...

04:51.718 --> 04:55.137
give us a little break tomorrow.

04:56.009 --> 04:59.512
You know, don't show up with
your people and your signs

04:59.537 --> 05:02.055
and your "stop wasting
your breath" bullshit.

05:02.541 --> 05:05.330
If you come, I'm not gonna protect you.

05:05.745 --> 05:07.507
It's the holidays.

05:08.463 --> 05:10.965
People want to drink, they want to relax,

05:11.016 --> 05:12.541
blow off a little steam,

05:13.468 --> 05:15.340
spend some time with their families.

05:36.851 --> 05:38.757
_

05:44.526 --> 05:47.111
What the fuck does that mean?

06:21.370 --> 06:23.203
Hey there, Chief.

06:25.870 --> 06:27.341
Did it work?

06:27.842 --> 06:28.843
Yeah.

06:28.877 --> 06:30.496
They'll be there.

06:30.521 --> 06:32.272
Fuckin' briar patch, huh?

06:32.297 --> 06:34.081
Yeah, fuckin' briar patch.

06:34.341 --> 06:36.843
Be sure everything's ready at
the school for the walk-through.

06:37.420 --> 06:38.662
And tell the mayor to be there.

06:38.687 --> 06:41.314
I don't want any fuckin' pushback
when I arrest these assholes.

06:41.339 --> 06:43.424
- Copy that, Chief.
- Anything else?

06:43.504 --> 06:47.540
Oh, it looks like somebody
stole the baby from the Nativity.

06:47.565 --> 06:49.334
You know, Jesus.

06:50.232 --> 06:52.071
Am I supposed to give a shit?

06:52.479 --> 06:53.596
Uh, no?

06:53.621 --> 06:54.958
That's correct, Dennis.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.663
The number you have dialed
is no longer in service,

07:05.714 --> 07:08.165
and there is no new number.

07:09.668 --> 07:12.169
The number you have dialed
is no longer in service,

07:12.171 --> 07:14.338
and there is no new number.

07:16.675 --> 07:18.371
What the fuck, Tommy?

07:27.653 --> 07:29.153
Ho ho!

07:29.187 --> 07:32.323
Goddamn it. You are goin' down, man.

07:42.784 --> 07:44.785
Ohh! Ha ha ha!

07:44.836 --> 07:46.362
He'll call.

07:46.838 --> 07:48.351
When?

07:48.840 --> 07:50.149
When we need him to.

07:50.792 --> 07:53.289
It's been 6 fuckin' weeks, Christine.

07:53.546 --> 07:55.450
I think we fuckin' need him to.

07:56.108 --> 07:57.332
He'll call.

07:59.570 --> 08:01.537
And why are you in my dream?

08:05.307 --> 08:06.774
Ha ha ha!

08:12.898 --> 08:14.939
Why are you in my dream?

08:15.231 --> 08:16.698
Are you Christine?

08:16.723 --> 08:18.857
- Um, uh...
- Do you know this guy?

08:18.882 --> 08:21.884
- I... I talked to him a couple of times.
- [Speaking German]

08:22.143 --> 08:23.594
You walk over the dead.

08:23.619 --> 08:25.202
Hey, step the fuck back, man.

08:25.227 --> 08:26.410
- They're all in white!
- Hey!

08:26.435 --> 08:28.435
You walk over the dead!

08:28.463 --> 08:29.797
Stop him!

08:29.831 --> 08:31.582
- They're all in white!
- Stop!

08:31.633 --> 08:33.167
They're all in white!

08:34.469 --> 08:35.919
They're all in white!

08:35.971 --> 08:37.505
They're all in white!

08:39.803 --> 08:40.841
Fuck!

08:47.038 --> 08:48.672
They're all in white!

08:48.863 --> 08:51.532
- Aah! Get off me!
- Call the police!

08:51.557 --> 08:54.025
You get off me! Get the fuck off me!

08:54.050 --> 08:56.719
- Call the cops! Call the police!
- No! Don't do it!

08:56.744 --> 08:58.049
I know!

08:58.994 --> 09:01.171
I know what's inside you!

09:02.582 --> 09:03.998
I know what's inside you!

09:04.032 --> 09:06.229
Come on, Christine. Let's get out of here.

09:06.397 --> 09:08.264
Come on! Come on!

09:08.289 --> 09:10.023
I know what's inside you.

09:25.036 --> 09:26.637
Ooh, that for me?

09:26.688 --> 09:28.305
No.

09:28.307 --> 09:29.844
Yeah, it is. What'd you get me?

09:29.920 --> 09:31.371
What'd you get me?

09:31.396 --> 09:33.396
The greatest gift of all... love.

09:36.838 --> 09:38.422
Found them.

09:42.571 --> 09:44.208
Those are Grandpa's, not ours.

09:48.844 --> 09:50.828
I'll look for the others when I get home.

09:50.879 --> 09:52.506
Tonight, OK?

09:54.749 --> 09:56.173
I tried calling your brother.

09:56.399 --> 09:58.400
He get a new cell phone?

09:58.804 --> 10:00.149
I don't know.

10:00.315 --> 10:02.816
Well, when's the last
time you talked to him?

10:03.175 --> 10:04.809
Couple months ago.

10:05.093 --> 10:07.215
He's still in San Francisco, right?

10:07.813 --> 10:08.856
I don't know.

10:08.881 --> 10:10.631
- Well, what do you know?
- I told you, I haven't

10:10.656 --> 10:12.585
talked to him. Stop copping me.

10:12.610 --> 10:14.095
I'm not copping.

10:14.643 --> 10:16.977
I'm allowed to care about
where your brother is.

10:17.190 --> 10:19.459
OK, I get it. Jesus, Dad.

10:19.484 --> 10:21.553
Hey, speaking of Jesus,

10:21.660 --> 10:23.661
big deal at school, Mr. Garvey.

10:23.695 --> 10:25.684
- Everybody's talking about it.
- What?

10:26.199 --> 10:29.700
The baby, how it just
vanished from the manger.

10:31.119 --> 10:33.202
Didn't vanish. It got stolen.

10:33.462 --> 10:36.464
So does that mean it's the police's
responsibility to get it back?

10:36.539 --> 10:38.456
Well, Aimee, as the Chief of Police,

10:38.481 --> 10:41.155
I would say that that might
be a misuse of our resources.

10:41.593 --> 10:43.010
Hmm.

10:43.035 --> 10:44.384
They're just gonna replace it.

10:44.557 --> 10:45.862
That's cheating.

10:47.185 --> 10:48.567
Excuse me?

10:50.523 --> 10:51.966
You can't just get a new one.

10:51.991 --> 10:53.351
It's sacred.

10:59.731 --> 11:01.926
Jill, did you steal the baby Jesus?

11:05.094 --> 11:06.954
- That's sick.
- It is sick.

11:08.767 --> 11:09.827
OK,

11:10.125 --> 11:12.161
I have an actual job to go to,

11:12.186 --> 11:15.092
so I just want to be clear that I'm
not gonna be doing anything about...

11:16.214 --> 11:18.127
whatever this is.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.728
Cool. Don't.

11:30.403 --> 11:31.854
Hmm.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.576
You enjoying my sandwich?

11:43.399 --> 11:46.234
All right, listen up or else we're
gonna have another fuckin' riot.

11:46.543 --> 11:49.045
Gym only has 3 entrances. We're
not posting on any of them.

11:49.070 --> 11:50.712
- Where are we?
- Yeah. You got it?

11:50.737 --> 11:52.365
We are gonna be in the parking lot...

11:52.390 --> 11:54.779
unmarked cars, waiting.

11:54.804 --> 11:57.388
And if the G.R. sets
foot on school property,

11:57.413 --> 11:59.290
we're gonna arrest them
for criminal trespass.

11:59.395 --> 12:01.348
We're gonna scatter two-man teams there,

12:01.373 --> 12:04.040
there, there, and there.

12:04.512 --> 12:06.382
We'll have 4 more in the vans.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.589
Soon as they come on the
school grounds, we move.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.746
Miranda, zip cuffs...

12:11.725 --> 12:12.792
Mm-hmm.

12:12.817 --> 12:14.601
Oh, hang on. Give me a minute.

12:14.807 --> 12:17.466
What? How do you spell that?

12:17.929 --> 12:21.348
A-F-O-R-D-A,

12:21.384 --> 12:24.011
baby boy, 20 inches.

12:24.483 --> 12:25.926
The white one.

12:25.952 --> 12:28.175
Obviously the fucking white one, Marlene.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.667
Fuck. Good-bye.

12:29.692 --> 12:32.527
Did you know somebody stole the baby Jesus?

12:32.552 --> 12:34.302
- Yeah.
- All you have to do

12:34.391 --> 12:37.676
is run over to the Biggie
Superstore and pick a new one up.

12:37.701 --> 12:38.995
A new one?

12:39.667 --> 12:42.418
For fuck's sake, Kevin. It's
not the actual baby Jesus.

12:42.443 --> 12:44.160
No, you fuckin' do it.

12:44.872 --> 12:47.171
Can you give the Chief and I a moment?

12:48.965 --> 12:50.762
Here's what you're going to do.

12:51.117 --> 12:52.984
Get the fucking baby,

12:53.035 --> 12:55.487
open the box, strip it naked,

12:55.489 --> 12:57.853
scruff it up so you can
say that you found it

12:57.878 --> 13:00.625
in a ditch or a dumpster or something.

13:01.173 --> 13:02.819
And why would I do that?

13:03.962 --> 13:06.381
Because you need a win, Kevin.

13:29.718 --> 13:31.404
_

13:51.627 --> 13:53.211
Fuck.

13:54.597 --> 13:57.082
Somebody stole it, now
we're gonna get it back.

13:57.116 --> 13:59.285
Check the bank that faces the Nativity,

13:59.310 --> 14:01.249
see if we can pull last
night's camera feed.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.022
- Are you... Are you serious?
- Yes, Dennis, I am serious.

14:04.056 --> 14:06.174
So should I make that the priority...

14:06.209 --> 14:09.195
No. Look, the dance is still the priority,

14:09.220 --> 14:12.633
but I would like to stop dealing
with the goddamn baby fuckin' Jesus!

14:12.720 --> 14:14.011
Fuck.

14:14.342 --> 14:15.400
Christ.

14:15.919 --> 14:16.902
Fuck.

14:23.243 --> 14:24.709
Fuck.

14:29.882 --> 14:32.334
Hey, Chief, you OK? You there?

14:32.385 --> 14:34.803
Chief?

14:34.837 --> 14:37.372
Hey, Chief? You OK?

14:37.406 --> 14:39.507
Chief?

14:47.183 --> 14:48.895
All right. Thank you so much.

14:49.652 --> 14:51.859
We'll be with you in a minute.

14:52.362 --> 14:54.863
- Hey, you want a bull's-eye, man?
- No, thanks, dude.

14:55.108 --> 14:56.961
- It's so the Creator can find us.
- Yeah.

14:56.986 --> 14:59.106
- You know, for next time.
- Hey, good luck with that.

15:01.967 --> 15:04.518
How much longer?

15:04.543 --> 15:05.791
I don't know.

15:07.351 --> 15:09.319
What'd you say to him?

15:09.344 --> 15:10.427
What?

15:10.590 --> 15:12.507
The naked guy who attacked you.

15:12.541 --> 15:15.594
You said you talked to him before
he went bat shit. What'd you say?

15:15.628 --> 15:17.712
I don't remember.

15:19.098 --> 15:21.182
Did you talk about Wayne?

15:21.217 --> 15:22.467
Maybe.

15:22.518 --> 15:25.103
OK, you can't talk about the ranch,

15:25.137 --> 15:27.689
Christine, OK?

15:27.723 --> 15:29.641
It isn't my fault.

15:29.643 --> 15:31.559
He attacked me.

15:31.611 --> 15:33.528
It is your fault,

15:33.562 --> 15:35.530
because you can't tell strangers

15:35.564 --> 15:37.449
that you're pregnant with Wayne's baby.

15:37.483 --> 15:40.177
I didn't tell him! It was in his dream!

15:40.202 --> 15:43.321
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Shh.

15:43.744 --> 15:45.744
Shh. From now on,

15:45.769 --> 15:47.575
you keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

15:47.627 --> 15:50.712
OK? Not a fuckin' word.

15:53.299 --> 15:54.923
This'll be a little cold.

16:06.145 --> 16:08.513
So you haven't been to
see a doctor before now?

16:08.515 --> 16:09.981
No.

16:10.016 --> 16:12.517
So no prenatal care,
vitamins, anything like that?

16:12.519 --> 16:13.802
No.

16:18.374 --> 16:20.108
There's the heart right there.

16:22.194 --> 16:25.422
Looks like you're at about
12 weeks, give or take.

16:28.820 --> 16:31.338
So... so the baby's OK?

16:32.748 --> 16:34.873
You want to tell me what happened?

16:36.425 --> 16:38.677
A guy attacked her.

16:38.711 --> 16:40.545
- A guy?
- Yeah.

16:40.596 --> 16:43.515
Yeah, a guy. I mean, he came out of
nowhere. He was on drugs or something.

16:43.549 --> 16:44.883
Did you call the police?

16:45.289 --> 16:47.018
Uh, no.

16:53.777 --> 16:55.727
I had to hit him to get him off of her.

16:55.778 --> 16:58.618
He just ran away. I...
I wanted to get her here.

16:58.899 --> 17:00.448
Are you the father?

17:00.483 --> 17:01.876
Just a friend.

17:05.570 --> 17:07.489
The fetus looks normal,

17:07.540 --> 17:09.887
but I want to admit you to Maternity,

17:09.913 --> 17:12.704
do a few tests, stay on the safe side.

17:15.247 --> 17:18.067
Just stay put, OK?

17:29.342 --> 17:30.895
Get up. We're leaving.

17:30.930 --> 17:33.431
- Come on. Get up.
- What?

17:33.433 --> 17:36.994
She thinks I did this to you.
Get up! Come on! Let's go!

17:38.043 --> 17:39.964
Say it wasn't my fault.

17:40.106 --> 17:42.824
It wasn't your fucking fault!

17:42.849 --> 17:44.192
Now come on!

17:44.243 --> 17:45.994
You have to mean it.

17:46.028 --> 17:47.445
It isn't your fucking fault!

17:47.496 --> 17:48.666
Come on!

17:51.000 --> 17:52.617
Don't tell them anything.

17:53.466 --> 17:55.067
Call Security!

17:55.371 --> 17:56.623
Hey!

17:57.339 --> 17:59.444
Hey! Hey! Stop!

18:11.387 --> 18:13.073
Went down this way.

18:35.277 --> 18:37.212
Dude, dude.

18:39.666 --> 18:41.132
Dude! I'm driving!

18:41.167 --> 18:43.334
Dude! No, no, no. I think he
wants us to pull over, man.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.337
- Pull over!
- Wrong! I got it!

18:50.676 --> 18:52.093
Shit.

18:52.144 --> 18:54.596
Oh, be cool, be cool, be cool.

19:03.462 --> 19:05.413
Hey, Officer. Sorry.

19:05.438 --> 19:06.898
We didn't know you were a cop.

19:08.004 --> 19:09.527
You guys usually have those flashing...

19:09.552 --> 19:11.733
You two hang out with my daughter, right?

19:13.044 --> 19:14.082
Jill Garvey?

19:14.116 --> 19:15.867
Yeah. Sure.

19:15.918 --> 19:17.242
She's awesome.

19:17.870 --> 19:20.542
Did she steal the baby
out of the Nativity scene?

19:21.041 --> 19:22.343
What?

19:23.281 --> 19:27.318
I've got security video, and one of
the suspects was wearing a hoodie.

19:29.965 --> 19:32.634
That's... profiling.

19:32.685 --> 19:34.102
Uh...

19:34.162 --> 19:36.163
Which one of you is the fuckin' smart one?

19:36.188 --> 19:38.056
Uh...

19:38.107 --> 19:40.558
You are a part of this,
and we all know that,

19:40.822 --> 19:43.009
but your dreams of getting
high in college will die

19:43.034 --> 19:44.981
because you'll have an arrest
on your fuckin' transcript.

19:45.075 --> 19:46.621
But if that baby is returned to me,

19:46.646 --> 19:48.149
no questions will be asked.

19:48.676 --> 19:49.973
Understood?

19:51.770 --> 19:53.794
- We don't get high...
- Understood?

19:56.625 --> 19:58.012
Yeah.

19:59.412 --> 20:00.962
Have a nice day.

20:08.087 --> 20:10.588
Dude, do not Instagram that.

20:10.639 --> 20:12.590
The cops can trace that shit.

20:16.505 --> 20:18.596
You're gonna get busted, Jill.

20:18.598 --> 20:20.234
Your dad already knows you took it.

20:20.265 --> 20:22.850
- Did you tell him I took it?
- No.

20:23.416 --> 20:24.435
But he does.

20:25.204 --> 20:26.938
Whatever.

20:27.365 --> 20:29.265
He doesn't care anyway.

20:31.610 --> 20:33.161
What the fuck are you doing?

20:33.195 --> 20:36.219
As our esteemed guest
was unjustly crucified

20:36.244 --> 20:37.503
by the Romans,

20:37.966 --> 20:39.933
I, milady, am bestowing unto him

20:40.498 --> 20:41.729
a Roman soldier's helmet.

20:41.754 --> 20:42.921
What is that?

20:42.955 --> 20:44.505
Oh, ho, ho, you will find out.

20:44.540 --> 20:45.807
Max. Dude.

20:45.841 --> 20:48.293
Oh, God! Don't!

20:48.344 --> 20:49.794
What the fuck? Oh, my God.

20:49.796 --> 20:52.347
You prick. Get your
balls off the son of God.

20:52.381 --> 20:54.599
Ah! Quit! Ah, fuck you.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.601
- We're bringing him back, right?
- I hope that hurt.

20:56.635 --> 20:58.136
- What?
- Your dad's obviously

20:58.138 --> 20:59.637
looking for it and he has

20:59.639 --> 21:01.556
enough shit on his plate, you know?

21:03.976 --> 21:06.561
Hey. Give me that.

21:09.448 --> 21:11.449
We're gonna need some gasoline.

21:11.483 --> 21:13.451
Ha ha! Yeah!

21:13.950 --> 21:15.351
Fuck yeah!

21:15.487 --> 21:17.288
Whoo!

21:17.323 --> 21:20.041
You are a fucking genius, Garvey!

21:22.127 --> 21:23.878
Oh, son of God,

21:24.255 --> 21:26.223
king of kings,

21:26.367 --> 21:28.666
lamb of lambs...

21:29.084 --> 21:31.219
I anoint thee.

22:02.482 --> 22:04.147
Light him up, Garvey.

22:08.791 --> 22:10.458
Light him up!

22:10.509 --> 22:11.876
Light him up!

22:11.878 --> 22:14.712
Light him up! Light him up!

22:14.714 --> 22:17.548
Light him up! Light him up!

22:17.550 --> 22:20.551
Light him up! Light him up...

22:25.641 --> 22:28.359
Oh, boo!

22:28.394 --> 22:29.861
What the fuck was that?

22:29.895 --> 22:31.396
Really! What's going on?

22:31.398 --> 22:33.531
Go fuck yourselves.

22:34.900 --> 22:37.869
Go fuck ourselves! Go fuck ourselves!

22:37.903 --> 22:40.905
Go fuck ourselves! Go fuck ourselves!

22:40.907 --> 22:43.875
Go fuck ourselves! Go fuck ourselves!

22:43.909 --> 22:45.877
Go fuck ourselves...

23:12.271 --> 23:14.906
Ah.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.867
_

23:40.299 --> 23:42.300
Clever.

23:42.302 --> 23:43.637
Clever.

23:58.817 --> 24:00.952
OK.

24:02.321 --> 24:04.011
Now's your chance.

24:07.510 --> 24:09.709
You want me to trust you?

24:10.711 --> 24:13.331
You want me to give my life for that girl?

24:15.010 --> 24:17.411
Then you need to let me know why.

24:18.110 --> 24:20.838
You have to let me know why.

24:27.847 --> 24:29.683
I want to go home.

24:35.354 --> 24:37.488
Last chance.

24:40.442 --> 24:42.860
Fuck you.

24:53.455 --> 24:54.760
Hello?

24:55.416 --> 24:56.424
Wayne?

24:56.458 --> 24:58.376
Have you lost someone?

24:58.427 --> 25:00.878
- What?
- So many of us were affected

25:00.880 --> 25:03.381
by the events of October 14th.

25:03.813 --> 25:06.384
Even now, after all this time,

25:06.386 --> 25:08.386
we're still struggling.

25:08.437 --> 25:10.521
Still looking for help

25:10.556 --> 25:12.523
and not knowing where to turn.

25:12.558 --> 25:14.559
If you or anyone you know

25:14.561 --> 25:18.029
has suffered loss as a result
of the Sudden Departure,

25:18.063 --> 25:20.531
please hold for a Loved
Ones representative.

25:20.566 --> 25:23.067
- We can help you find peace.
- You're fuckin' good, Wayne.

25:23.069 --> 25:25.392
That's a real fuckin' good one.

25:27.623 --> 25:29.073
Hello?

25:29.075 --> 25:31.242
What's it gonna be? Sir?

25:53.315 --> 25:55.683
Oh, shit.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.469
I'm Meg. We met the other day in...

26:31.520 --> 26:32.929
Yeah, no, I remember.

26:37.627 --> 26:39.400
Do you want to come in the house?

26:39.812 --> 26:41.546
Yes, thank you.

26:45.150 --> 26:46.703
You can smoke in the house.

26:51.663 --> 26:53.374
These came in to the precinct today,

26:53.408 --> 26:55.960
so if you don't eat them,
probably just go stale.

26:57.329 --> 26:58.563
There you go.

27:00.509 --> 27:01.832
There. Knife.

27:07.339 --> 27:09.287
Did you want a coffee?

27:09.891 --> 27:11.509
No, thank you.

27:21.269 --> 27:22.585
What's that?

27:32.030 --> 27:34.528
"Kevin, I can't say this to you,

27:34.916 --> 27:38.428
"but I won't just slip it
under the door and run away.

27:38.920 --> 27:42.229
"You deserve to look at me when it is said.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.828
"You were a good husband, Kevin,

27:46.045 --> 27:47.927
"probably a great one.

27:48.046 --> 27:50.881
"You were there when I
needed someone the most.

27:51.429 --> 27:53.434
"You fixed another man's mess,

27:53.468 --> 27:54.627
"my mess.

27:55.053 --> 27:57.429
"You raised Tom as if he were your own,

27:57.939 --> 28:00.691
and you loved him even
when he wouldn't let you."

28:02.035 --> 28:03.313
What are you doing?

28:03.338 --> 28:06.447
"I need you to know this isn't your fault.

28:06.756 --> 28:08.282
"It's nobody's fault.

28:08.929 --> 28:10.451
"I was broken.

28:10.729 --> 28:12.570
"I tried to fix myself.

28:12.829 --> 28:16.073
"I tried for you and for Tom and for Jill,

28:16.729 --> 28:19.627
"but I think I'm supposed to stay broken.

28:20.508 --> 28:21.524
Maybe we all are."

28:21.549 --> 28:23.411
What's in that envelope, Laurie?

28:24.909 --> 28:27.752
"I won't insult you, Kevin, by saying
that this is what's best for you."

28:27.754 --> 28:29.781
No, please stop talking, just for a second.

28:30.769 --> 28:33.607
- "It's not my place to know."
- What's in the envelope?

28:33.642 --> 28:35.659
"You've always been the
best shoulder to cry on."

28:35.694 --> 28:37.428
Please stop talking.

28:37.430 --> 28:40.014
- "But I had to stop crying."
- What's in the envelope?

28:40.474 --> 28:42.953
- "The world changed faster... "
- Shut the fuck up!

29:01.190 --> 29:04.244
_

29:05.123 --> 29:06.895
Are they making you do this?

29:09.628 --> 29:11.151
You just...

29:11.567 --> 29:12.595
you don't...

29:14.132 --> 29:16.634
talk to me for 6 months, and
then you just walk in here,

29:16.636 --> 29:18.190
into our house...

29:19.138 --> 29:21.054
and then you give me this?

29:23.675 --> 29:25.255
No.

29:26.561 --> 29:28.056
No.

29:29.531 --> 29:32.650
I'm your husband. We made fucking vows.

29:34.236 --> 29:37.538
You want this... this over?
Then you fuckin' say it!

29:37.572 --> 29:39.540
You fuckin' say it!

29:39.839 --> 29:41.423
Not her!

29:43.795 --> 29:45.697
Say it!

29:46.376 --> 29:48.443
"I want this over!"

29:49.335 --> 29:51.001
Fucking say it!

29:51.052 --> 29:53.671
You fucking say it, Laurie!

30:11.323 --> 30:12.595
Honey.

30:29.451 --> 30:30.758
It's for you.

30:46.378 --> 30:47.994
I think you should go.

30:59.072 --> 31:01.411
I didn't know you had a daughter.

31:22.777 --> 31:25.251
_

31:28.817 --> 31:30.935
You should keep that.

31:32.938 --> 31:34.569
I won't tell.

32:05.041 --> 32:06.637
'Scuse me.

32:08.106 --> 32:10.413
Uh, w-where is Maternity?

32:10.438 --> 32:11.906
Fifth floor.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.596
Thank you.

32:44.961 --> 32:47.144
Do you know you're in a hospital?

32:48.480 --> 32:51.181
Uh, we don't... we don't
believe in shoes, man.

32:55.577 --> 32:57.968
How'd you end up like this, kid?

33:05.465 --> 33:07.197
I was abandoned by my father.

33:23.932 --> 33:25.382
Hey.

33:25.384 --> 33:27.384
- Hey.
- You ready to go now?

33:27.945 --> 33:28.950
Yeah.

33:29.319 --> 33:30.554
Here.

33:33.441 --> 33:34.892
What's that for?

33:34.894 --> 33:36.977
It'll make you invisible,

33:37.028 --> 33:39.707
so the Creator can find us.

33:44.119 --> 33:46.593
I knew you'd come back.

33:49.124 --> 33:51.065
I promised...

33:52.078 --> 33:54.566
that I would protect you.

33:58.483 --> 34:00.918
I'll protect it, too.

34:11.429 --> 34:13.563
Leave your shoes.

35:45.940 --> 35:47.505
Headed to the dance.

35:47.860 --> 35:50.744
Put 20 bucks under the magnet
if you want to order a pizza.

35:51.230 --> 35:52.497
Thanks.

35:55.029 --> 35:57.534
How much did you hear last night?

35:59.871 --> 36:02.506
"Fucking say it, Laurie."

36:08.290 --> 36:09.657
Why was she here?

36:12.217 --> 36:14.885
Well, it's complicated.

36:15.714 --> 36:17.554
Let me know when it gets simple.

36:31.237 --> 36:33.570
Go, go, go, go! Hey!

36:33.572 --> 36:35.289
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

36:35.323 --> 36:37.908
Stop, stop, stop. Stop!

36:39.072 --> 36:40.872
Go! Drive, drive!

37:00.565 --> 37:02.201
I found him.

37:10.942 --> 37:13.443
You don't know where Yemen is?

37:13.478 --> 37:15.445
No, I don't. Show me.

37:15.447 --> 37:17.447
I'll draw a map on your hand.

37:19.033 --> 37:21.618
So, if Dubai is here,

37:21.620 --> 37:25.138
then Yemen is right here.

37:28.863 --> 37:30.330
Hi there, buddy.

37:30.545 --> 37:31.795
Hey.

37:31.797 --> 37:33.657
We didn't want to wake you.

37:34.015 --> 37:36.800
Tom, this is Tom.

37:36.851 --> 37:38.218
How 'bout you're Tommy?

37:42.857 --> 37:45.359
You OK?

37:45.393 --> 37:46.752
Uh-huh.

38:19.610 --> 38:21.595
Careful there, Tommy.

38:21.646 --> 38:25.515
Some sad idiot paid a fuckin'
fortune just to bury that thing.

38:28.893 --> 38:30.575
_

38:51.255 --> 38:52.592
Hey, Tom!

38:52.627 --> 38:54.544
They're all in white!

38:54.546 --> 38:57.504
It's just like the dream!

39:16.534 --> 39:19.569
Everyone having a great time tonight?

39:21.513 --> 39:25.722
So, how is everyone enjoying
those delicious cookies?

39:26.848 --> 39:30.213
They're courtesy of Alan and Marty...

39:40.675 --> 39:42.822
Oh, and, um,

39:43.144 --> 39:47.264
one last thank you to Chief Garvey

39:47.315 --> 39:51.151
and his amazing team for
keeping us all safe tonight.

39:51.712 --> 39:54.271
Come on up here, Kevin. Say hello.

40:03.744 --> 40:04.948
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

40:04.950 --> 40:07.534
I'm sure you're all set to have
a pretty great time tonight.

40:07.618 --> 40:09.669
I only ask that if you have a few drinks,

40:09.704 --> 40:12.089
that you call a cab on the ride home.

40:12.123 --> 40:14.091
Thank you, and, uh,

40:14.125 --> 40:16.593
also... ahem... I know a lot of you

40:16.627 --> 40:18.694
were worried about this little guy,

40:19.130 --> 40:21.548
but we found him safe and sound,

40:21.599 --> 40:24.101
and as soon as the dance
is over, I am personally

40:24.135 --> 40:27.354
gonna be delivering him
back to the manger, so...

40:27.859 --> 40:29.856
that... ahem...

40:30.319 --> 40:31.841
there's that.

40:34.028 --> 40:35.979
Thank you, Chief Garvey.

40:35.981 --> 40:38.031
- Sure.
- We're lucky to have you.

40:41.235 --> 40:43.403
OK, Mapleton, how 'bout a slow one?

41:01.211 --> 41:02.607
You all danced out?

41:03.109 --> 41:05.239
Just taking a break
before my stunning finale.

41:05.264 --> 41:07.711
- Oh.
- What's up with the baby?

41:08.504 --> 41:09.729
Oh.

41:09.764 --> 41:11.348
It's not real. It's...

41:11.399 --> 41:13.400
I figured.

41:16.420 --> 41:18.355
This is my locker.

41:18.406 --> 41:19.723
You went here?

41:19.757 --> 41:21.558
- I did.
- Oh, I don't remember you.

41:21.592 --> 41:23.577
That's because you're much older than I am.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.097
That was my husband's locker.

41:35.844 --> 41:37.070
Doug.

41:37.909 --> 41:40.454
Ten feet away. It took him
a whole year to notice me.

41:43.104 --> 41:44.130
Oh.

41:44.182 --> 41:45.616
"Oh"?

41:48.386 --> 41:50.475
No, I just...

41:56.618 --> 41:58.528
I'm sorry about what happened to him,

41:58.563 --> 42:00.022
to you.

42:07.471 --> 42:10.106
I just found out he cheated on me.

42:13.494 --> 42:15.260
I cheated on my wife.

42:17.331 --> 42:18.949
Why?

42:28.260 --> 42:30.927
Is there a good answer to that question?

42:32.263 --> 42:35.432
Hmm. I think I just heard it.

42:40.244 --> 42:41.605
It's Kevin, right?

42:41.607 --> 42:43.189
Mm-hmm.

42:43.575 --> 42:44.774
Nora?

42:44.825 --> 42:46.203
Mm-hmm.

42:47.540 --> 42:48.612
Nice to meet you.

42:48.646 --> 42:51.114
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too.

42:51.116 --> 42:52.650
Nice to meet you.

42:57.784 --> 42:58.891
Have a good night.

42:58.916 --> 43:01.968
'Night. Heh heh!

43:09.267 --> 43:11.268
Chief, we can't touch 'em.

43:11.302 --> 43:12.686
What?

43:12.720 --> 43:15.772
They're about 5 yards
back from school property.

43:22.146 --> 43:24.114
Chief, what are you...

43:24.148 --> 43:26.616
Look like they're on school property to me.

43:26.651 --> 43:29.286
It's our word against theirs, right?

43:40.665 --> 43:43.667
Behind your back. Let's
go, let's go. Come on. Up.

43:43.669 --> 43:45.669
You know, I actually started to worry

43:45.671 --> 43:48.267
that you might be a human
being for once and not show up?

43:49.189 --> 43:50.461
This way.

43:51.389 --> 43:53.009
Thanks for not letting me down.

44:11.696 --> 44:13.830
Where's everybody else?

46:46.895 --> 46:48.606
_

46:49.256 --> 46:50.915
Do you want me to come with you?

47:39.364 --> 47:40.814
Hey!

47:41.516 --> 47:43.239
Hey, Chief.

47:44.988 --> 47:46.989
I heard the baby went missing.

47:47.014 --> 47:49.593
I... had a spare.

47:51.991 --> 47:53.608
Oh.

48:00.090 --> 48:02.175
Merry Christmas.
