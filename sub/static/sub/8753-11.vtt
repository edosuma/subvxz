WEBVTT

00:10.166 --> 00:13.802
He has oftentimes tried
to destroy this house.

00:15.738 --> 00:18.209
This is not her house.

00:18.211 --> 00:20.216
He's a very violent person.

00:20.218 --> 00:23.093
It's like it's taking,
you know, over her life.

00:23.095 --> 00:25.533
- What did the voice says?
- "Leave."

00:25.535 --> 00:27.168
Her family was haunted.

00:27.170 --> 00:28.636
This is not good.

00:28.638 --> 00:32.677
There's a lot of chaotic energy,
and he'll flip out.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.447
She's not okay.

00:34.449 --> 00:36.821
She's a disaster.

00:36.823 --> 00:39.560
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:39.562 --> 00:41.897
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.899 --> 00:44.802
What's happening?

00:44.804 --> 00:46.372
I see dead people.

00:46.374 --> 00:48.410
It seems like a devil.

00:48.412 --> 00:50.082
I speak to dead people.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.718
He's pissed off.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.153
And they speak to me.

00:53.155 --> 00:54.791
I felt real fear.

00:54.793 --> 00:58.266
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.268 --> 00:59.939
I think she's being murdered.

00:59.941 --> 01:01.878
I rely on my partner.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.480
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.482 --> 01:05.150
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.885
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:06.887 --> 01:10.458
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.460 --> 01:11.660
Nobody believes me.

01:11.662 --> 01:13.128
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.130 --> 01:15.397
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:15.399 --> 01:17.134
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.136 --> 01:19.171
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.173 --> 01:20.406
Until the very end.

01:20.408 --> 01:22.142
You got problems, I got news for you.

01:22.144 --> 01:24.348
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.350 --> 01:26.420
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

01:26.422 --> 01:27.689
Or time to get out.

01:27.691 --> 01:30.762
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:45.518 --> 01:47.921
I'm back in Flint, Michigan.

01:47.923 --> 01:49.659
I got a call from a local sheriff

01:49.661 --> 01:51.763
who's literally scared for his mom's life,

01:51.765 --> 01:54.767
and he's not talking about street crime.

01:54.769 --> 01:56.102
He says there's something in the house

01:56.104 --> 01:57.305
that's really trying to hurt her,

01:57.307 --> 01:58.541
and he has no idea how to fight it.

01:58.543 --> 02:01.576
Hopefully, Amy and I can help him out.

02:08.090 --> 02:10.491
Before Amy arrives,

02:10.494 --> 02:14.029
I look for any leading information.

02:14.031 --> 02:17.369
This house is filled with
photos and religious symbols.

02:18.974 --> 02:20.742
Once they're covered or removed,

02:20.744 --> 02:23.378
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.002
As soon as we pulled into the neighborhood,

02:41.004 --> 02:47.542
I feel horribly ill, dizzy, nauseous,

02:47.544 --> 02:49.509
panic, and this anxiety

02:49.511 --> 02:52.545
because of whatever happened here.

02:52.547 --> 02:58.951
It definitely is very present,

02:58.953 --> 03:02.759
and my head is like [bleep] killing me,

03:02.761 --> 03:08.630
like, all the back of my
head is just killing me.

03:10.803 --> 03:12.768
Ugh.

03:21.906 --> 03:24.009
Well, Ryan, I'm glad to be here,

03:24.011 --> 03:26.111
especially knowing you're a fellow cop.

03:26.113 --> 03:28.112
- You called because of your mom.
- Yes.

03:28.114 --> 03:29.980
And she's going through
some tough times here.

03:29.982 --> 03:32.482
Correct. My mom lives here alone.

03:32.484 --> 03:35.285
She's had multiple things happen here,

03:35.287 --> 03:38.556
and it just seems to
have gradually escalated,

03:38.558 --> 03:42.956
and she told me that every
night something occurs,

03:42.958 --> 03:45.856
whether it's a noise, seeing apparitions,

03:45.858 --> 03:48.058
stuff getting thrown,

03:48.060 --> 03:50.662
feeling like something's
standing at the end of her bed,

03:50.664 --> 03:53.967
something getting in the bed with her.

03:53.969 --> 03:55.003
I know my mom.

03:55.005 --> 03:57.174
If she says something's going on,

03:57.176 --> 03:59.979
I know something's legitimately going on.

03:59.981 --> 04:01.614
Now, how long has she been here?

04:01.616 --> 04:03.016
Seven years.

04:03.018 --> 04:04.685
Did you ask her to move?

04:04.687 --> 04:06.790
No, because I know she couldn't.

04:06.792 --> 04:09.927
Financially,
times aren't the best for anybody.

04:09.929 --> 04:11.062
So, let me ask you another question,

04:11.064 --> 04:12.430
what do you think is going on in this house?

04:12.432 --> 04:14.765
According to the neighbors,
somebody passed away in here.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.000
- Okay.
- Previous owner.

04:16.002 --> 04:18.168
And I think it's probably him.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.235
I don't know much about it,

04:20.237 --> 04:23.870
but I could've researched
what exactly happened here,

04:23.872 --> 04:25.305
obviously being in law enforcement...

04:25.307 --> 04:26.708
- Right...
- a lot more than I did.

04:26.710 --> 04:30.144
And I guess that's because I
didn't really want to know.

04:30.146 --> 04:32.145
Now, it's got to be tough for you

04:32.147 --> 04:33.279
knowing your mom's here alone.

04:33.281 --> 04:34.412
Yes.

04:34.414 --> 04:36.346
I mean, she's not comfortable in her house.

04:36.348 --> 04:38.749
You want to be comfortable
when you come home from work.

04:38.751 --> 04:40.384
You want to feel safe. She doesn't.

04:40.386 --> 04:43.119
If my mom's not comfortable in her house,

04:43.121 --> 04:46.623
I don't feel comfortable
bringing my wife who's pregnant

04:46.625 --> 04:48.323
and my baby in this house.

04:48.325 --> 04:52.529
There is definitely something here.

04:53.997 --> 04:58.567
Oh, there's something wrong
with the [bleep] tree.

04:58.569 --> 04:59.601
What do you mean?

04:59.603 --> 05:00.869
Very bad things have happened.

05:00.871 --> 05:02.870
Several people have been injured.

05:04.673 --> 05:06.843
I feel like a kid got hurt,

05:06.845 --> 05:10.678
like, I'm actually seeing these
weird things in the trees.

05:12.749 --> 05:16.285
They're walking around, breaking branches.

05:16.287 --> 05:20.522
I don't know if they're dead
people or something else.

05:21.691 --> 05:24.758
They definitely can shape shift.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.694
What's gonna scare you is
what they're gonna show you.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.262
Yeah. There's some creepy [bleep]

05:36.364 --> 05:39.166
Now, Ryan,
why'd you bring me into this bedroom?

05:39.168 --> 05:42.406
Well, this is where I stayed
for the couple of months

05:42.408 --> 05:44.008
that I lived here with my mother,

05:44.010 --> 05:48.012
and this is where the situation occurred

05:48.014 --> 05:50.879
that started making me look into, you know,

05:50.881 --> 05:53.083
exactly what was going on here.

05:53.085 --> 05:54.318
Okay, what happened?

05:54.320 --> 05:55.985
Well, I was sleeping,

05:55.987 --> 05:59.454
and then the next thing I know,
woke up for 15 seconds.

05:59.456 --> 06:02.126
I was pinned down in my bed,

06:02.128 --> 06:03.626
and it was like I was paralyzed.

06:03.628 --> 06:04.893
I couldn't do anything.

06:04.895 --> 06:06.626
And I saw him holding me down.

06:06.628 --> 06:08.529
He was right in my face laughing,

06:08.531 --> 06:10.132
like, "I'm doing this to you,

06:10.134 --> 06:12.034
and you can't do anything about it."

06:12.036 --> 06:13.467
Okay, were you dreaming?

06:13.469 --> 06:14.767
No.

06:14.769 --> 06:17.201
I mean, I was clear-minded.
I knew where I was at.

06:17.203 --> 06:19.102
Now, Ryan, after experiencing what you did,

06:19.104 --> 06:21.004
and knowing what your mom's going through,

06:21.006 --> 06:22.740
I mean, that's got to have you worried

06:22.742 --> 06:24.876
that every night she comes
into the house alone.

06:24.878 --> 06:27.178
This is not her house.

06:31.084 --> 06:32.484
What the hell?

06:34.487 --> 06:37.019
I'm seeing, like, this guy.

06:37.021 --> 06:40.890
He's, like, a big guy...

06:40.892 --> 06:45.330
built, tough... and he's naked,

06:45.332 --> 06:51.940
and he has, like, a crust all over his body.

06:53.477 --> 06:57.314
He told me that he was
a convict and a felon.

06:59.116 --> 07:03.455
He definitely acts out a lot.

07:03.457 --> 07:09.527
The man does not like anyone in here.

07:09.529 --> 07:12.598
Anybody in here is gonna get it.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.066
And I do see him, like, coming up

07:15.068 --> 07:18.239
and, like, you know, just, like, bam!

07:18.241 --> 07:20.408
Bam! Over and over and over and over.

07:20.410 --> 07:23.610
He pretty much hated any...
everyone when he was alive,

07:23.612 --> 07:25.212
and he hates everybody now.

07:25.214 --> 07:28.347
I think he's even lifted the bed.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.084
To the living,

07:32.086 --> 07:38.088
it kind of looks like a big,
black shadow entity,

07:38.090 --> 07:43.496
you know, like,
just looming and just [bleep] going nuts.

07:50.967 --> 07:53.237
Now, Cyndi, you're Dawn's younger sister.

07:53.239 --> 07:54.570
Yes.

07:54.572 --> 07:56.670
Now, you know your sister better
than anybody, I would think.

07:56.672 --> 07:59.171
Have you seen any change in her?

07:59.173 --> 08:00.506
Yes. A lot.

08:00.508 --> 08:02.143
- In what way?
- It's this home.

08:02.145 --> 08:04.712
It's like it's taking,
you know, over her life,

08:04.714 --> 08:06.513
like a man takes over a woman's life...

08:06.515 --> 08:08.214
- Right. Right...
- controlling man.

08:08.216 --> 08:11.350
And it doesn't want her to go anywhere.

08:11.352 --> 08:13.320
Okay, so, now,
the obvious question I'm gonna ask you is,

08:13.322 --> 08:15.157
have you had any experiences
while you've been here?

08:15.159 --> 08:16.225
Yes, I have.

08:16.227 --> 08:18.328
Well, Dawn and I were down here,

08:18.330 --> 08:20.866
and I was standing, like, with my back

08:20.868 --> 08:22.468
towards the fire burner,

08:22.470 --> 08:26.637
and I feel like a quick tug on my shirt.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.174
Did you get caught up on anything?

08:29.176 --> 08:30.710
Were you moving or were
you standing next to...?

08:30.712 --> 08:31.911
No, I was in the middle of the room.

08:31.913 --> 08:33.280
That's strange.

08:33.283 --> 08:35.452
Anything else?

08:35.453 --> 08:37.985
A couple months ago, I thought I saw a man

08:37.986 --> 08:40.289
standing at the bottom of the stairs.

08:40.291 --> 08:41.890
- Of these stairs?
- Yes.

08:41.892 --> 08:43.390
Like, watching me come in.

08:43.392 --> 08:44.957
Okay, what did it look like?

08:44.959 --> 08:47.328
It was just a shadow of a man.

08:47.330 --> 08:48.962
It was so dark, I couldn't see through it.

08:48.964 --> 08:50.463
I don't like it being here right now.

08:50.465 --> 08:51.463
Now, Dawn's here alone.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.931
I'm curious what your opinion is

08:52.933 --> 08:55.466
as to whatever's here wants from her?

08:55.468 --> 08:56.866
Her.

08:56.868 --> 08:58.967
Her. Meaning?

08:58.969 --> 09:00.201
Soul.

09:00.203 --> 09:01.369
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

09:02.705 --> 09:04.539
All right.

09:05.975 --> 09:08.176
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

09:09.979 --> 09:11.980
That's your sister.

09:18.720 --> 09:23.122
Seeing that convict, this is his area.

09:23.124 --> 09:25.723
Oh, he's pretty physical,

09:25.725 --> 09:28.794
like, he's pretty... a solid person.

09:28.796 --> 09:31.598
I think they do feel him pulling people,

09:31.600 --> 09:34.939
like, grabbing their arms,
like, "Get over here!"

09:34.941 --> 09:36.440
or "I'm trying to talk to you!"

09:36.442 --> 09:38.541
He's like, "I'm good. I can do this."

09:38.543 --> 09:41.609
He has oftentimes tried
to destroy this house,

09:41.611 --> 09:45.047
and then the walls won't be
able to hold him anymore.

09:45.049 --> 09:46.481
How does he try to do that?

09:46.483 --> 09:50.322
Well, he was showing me
with the oven and the gas...

09:50.324 --> 09:52.990
Yeah, like,
I wouldn't want to be down here with that.

09:55.093 --> 09:58.329
And he was [bleep] around with gas.

10:19.101 --> 10:22.171
So, I talked to your son.
I talked to you sister.

10:22.173 --> 10:23.606
They're worried about you.

10:23.608 --> 10:26.310
Yeah. I'm not as outgoing
and as happy as I used to be.

10:26.312 --> 10:28.747
I'm just getting so used to things going on

10:28.749 --> 10:30.683
that it's just, like,
"Oh, it happened again,"

10:30.685 --> 10:34.423
or I hear a noise, and it's like,
"Okay, it's in here."

10:34.425 --> 10:37.059
So, do you think that whatever's
here is controlling you?

10:37.061 --> 10:39.295
Probably.

10:39.297 --> 10:42.531
Your son don't want to
bring his family here.

10:42.533 --> 10:45.535
And I just feel like whatever's here

10:45.537 --> 10:47.972
enjoys that, that way I'm by myself.

10:47.974 --> 10:49.876
I feel watched.

10:49.878 --> 10:51.678
I'm not alone.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.247
I'm just with <i> it,</i> whatever's here.

10:54.249 --> 10:55.782
Now, knowing you've had experiences

10:55.784 --> 10:57.548
throughout the house,
is there any place you can show me?

10:57.550 --> 10:58.983
Sure. Yeah. Okay.

10:58.985 --> 11:04.289
I don't spend time down here
'cause it gives me the creeps.

11:04.291 --> 11:07.424
What's going on?

11:07.426 --> 11:09.558
Well, I've heard a voice.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.158
So, what did the voice say?

11:11.160 --> 11:15.228
It said, "Leave."

11:15.230 --> 11:17.797
I left very quickly.

11:17.799 --> 11:19.899
Could you tell if it was
a male or a female voice?

11:19.901 --> 11:22.136
To me, it sounded like a man.

11:22.138 --> 11:23.571
Was it threatening?

11:23.573 --> 11:25.642
Yeah, to me, it felt threatening,

11:25.644 --> 11:28.012
when somebody tells you
to leave your own home.

11:28.014 --> 11:29.211
Anything else?

11:29.213 --> 11:30.712
I was coming in from the garage,

11:30.714 --> 11:33.718
I heard a squeaky noise, and I looked down,

11:33.720 --> 11:36.555
and I see my basement door opening.

11:36.557 --> 11:38.858
There was no wind, nothing,

11:38.860 --> 11:42.497
and I saw it open halfway, it stopped.

11:42.499 --> 11:45.202
And I just ran out in the front
yard and called my sister.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.236
- Nobody was in the house, I assume?
- No.

11:47.238 --> 11:49.505
Now, I notice that you're
visibly more nervous

11:49.507 --> 11:51.108
talking inside the house here.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.241
Oh, very nervous.

11:52.243 --> 11:54.844
I normally don't talk about it in the house,

11:54.846 --> 11:57.380
because I feel as if when I do,

11:57.382 --> 12:00.020
there's gonna be more activity at night.

12:00.022 --> 12:02.157
Okay, so you feel us talking
about this inside the house

12:02.159 --> 12:03.525
is gonna make things worse here?

12:03.527 --> 12:04.760
Oh, definitely tonight.

12:06.798 --> 12:09.466
So, I'm seeing a big guy.

12:09.468 --> 12:13.270
One thing that he likes to do,
you know, like, slamming doors.

12:16.810 --> 12:19.547
He'll flip out and he'll, like, throw a fit,

12:19.549 --> 12:22.016
and, like, you know, bashing himself,

12:22.018 --> 12:24.617
like, full body, like, into the walls.

12:27.882 --> 12:30.887
And that's something that
the living would experience?

12:30.889 --> 12:32.156
Yeah. Yes.

12:32.158 --> 12:35.696
There's a lot of chaotic energy.

12:35.698 --> 12:38.766
He's very good at, like,

12:38.768 --> 12:40.535
throwing his [bleep] on other people.

12:40.537 --> 12:44.175
Like, in life he could hit them, you know,

12:44.177 --> 12:47.474
in death he can be as physical as he can be

12:47.476 --> 12:49.174
so, like, "Feel that. Take that. Feel that."

12:49.176 --> 12:51.075
He's really, really good at that.

12:57.376 --> 12:59.645
Okay.
This is a storage room, I guess, right?

12:59.647 --> 13:01.047
This is my storage room.

13:01.049 --> 13:03.382
I only come in here when I
need to get something out.

13:03.384 --> 13:04.449
What the hell is this?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.684
Well, one day I came in,

13:06.686 --> 13:10.386
and I keep a bouquet of flowers in this box.

13:10.388 --> 13:12.386
Okay. And when I came in,

13:12.388 --> 13:14.856
one single flower from that bouquet

13:14.858 --> 13:16.625
was in the middle of the floor.

13:16.627 --> 13:18.596
So, could have somebody come
down here and moved the flower?

13:18.598 --> 13:21.529
No. Nobody comes into the house.

13:21.531 --> 13:22.995
So, what's with the frames?

13:22.997 --> 13:26.267
It's Christian,
and I just felt safer putting them there.

13:26.269 --> 13:28.468
When did this happen,
a week... like, a couple days ago?

13:28.470 --> 13:30.469
No, it's been at least three years.

13:30.471 --> 13:31.736
It's been like this for three years?

13:31.738 --> 13:32.805
Yeah, at least three years.

13:32.807 --> 13:34.076
And you've left it here on the floor?

13:34.078 --> 13:35.544
I left it on the floor.

13:35.546 --> 13:37.145
And if I ever come down
here to get something,

13:37.147 --> 13:38.546
I just walk around it.

13:38.548 --> 13:39.878
Okay.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.345
And what do you think the
meaning of the flower was?

13:42.347 --> 13:43.747
That whatever's here,

13:43.749 --> 13:46.181
it's wanted me to accept the flower.

13:46.183 --> 13:47.947
And I said right out loud,

13:47.949 --> 13:50.414
"I am not accepting this flower.
I'm leaving it right here."

13:53.686 --> 13:59.093
A woman is crying a lot down here.

13:59.095 --> 14:01.763
I think she's not okay.

14:03.163 --> 14:06.433
Mentally, she's not okay.

14:06.435 --> 14:09.335
She's a disaster.

14:09.337 --> 14:11.302
Very thin.

14:11.304 --> 14:13.570
She's decaying,

14:13.572 --> 14:15.973
and it hurts also in the back of the neck.

14:15.975 --> 14:17.909
It hurts.

14:17.911 --> 14:20.712
Ahh, and she said... Ow!

14:20.714 --> 14:23.579
Man, it hurts really [bleep] bad.

14:23.581 --> 14:25.414
Oh, my god.

14:25.416 --> 14:29.418
I don't know how old she is, mid-20s maybe.

14:29.420 --> 14:31.586
Very depressed all the time.

14:31.588 --> 14:34.757
How would the living experience that?

14:37.525 --> 14:39.893
They would feel her.

14:39.895 --> 14:42.328
They would feel a lot of stress.

14:42.330 --> 14:46.066
They would feel her get into bed with them,

14:46.068 --> 14:48.834
sleeping there, talking to them,

14:48.836 --> 14:52.473
touching, caressing, like petting almost,

14:52.475 --> 14:54.408
like petting them, and snuggling,

14:54.410 --> 14:55.910
like, trying to snuggle up.

14:55.912 --> 14:58.114
She wants a mom and a dad.

15:04.687 --> 15:06.922
This is a very active room.

15:06.924 --> 15:08.357
Okay. What's going on?

15:08.359 --> 15:10.025
I was sleeping on my back,

15:10.027 --> 15:13.698
and something leaned
over and gave me a kiss,

15:13.700 --> 15:16.301
like it was a goodnight kiss.

15:16.303 --> 15:18.504
Not in a romantic way?

15:18.506 --> 15:20.036
Not in a romantic way at all.

15:20.038 --> 15:21.671
Anything else going on in here?

15:21.673 --> 15:23.306
When I'm sleeping,

15:23.308 --> 15:26.042
it will come and sit down on the bed,

15:26.044 --> 15:28.310
and I wake up because I can feel something

15:28.312 --> 15:30.179
going down on the bed... Okay.

15:30.181 --> 15:32.348
As if someone's sitting down on the bed.

15:32.350 --> 15:33.583
I just can't move.

15:33.585 --> 15:36.223
I'm trying everything, and I can't move.

15:36.225 --> 15:40.196
I've tried ignoring it

15:40.198 --> 15:42.764
I guess I can't ignore it anymore.

15:42.766 --> 15:44.965
I want my granddaughter to
be able to spend the night.

15:44.967 --> 15:46.166
Doing these investigations

15:46.168 --> 15:48.102
for as long as I've been doing them now,

15:48.104 --> 15:50.838
everything you're describing to me,
this is not good.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.807
I'm glad your son called when he did.

15:53.809 --> 15:56.247
You know,
putting your head in the sand doesn't help.

15:56.249 --> 15:59.148
Look, I've done it for what?

15:59.150 --> 16:00.550
It's almost six years now.

16:00.552 --> 16:02.888
Well, I hope you know that I
believe what you're telling me.

16:02.890 --> 16:05.226
Thank you.

16:07.363 --> 16:11.702
The depressed girl likes it in here a lot.

16:11.704 --> 16:15.707
This is her bed... her bedroom.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.374
She comes here.

16:17.376 --> 16:20.379
She likes to sleep on that side.

16:20.381 --> 16:25.924
She would like to just
stay up here all the time,

16:25.926 --> 16:28.393
but she can't.

16:28.395 --> 16:31.960
She goes from the basement to here.

16:31.962 --> 16:33.628
She'll walk down the hallway,

16:33.630 --> 16:38.737
and I think that people have
seen her walking in the hallway.

16:38.739 --> 16:42.540
But when the living come,
she hangs on to them.

16:58.067 --> 17:00.265
Yesterday Ryan told me

17:00.267 --> 17:02.536
he thought somebody passed
away at his mom's home,

17:02.538 --> 17:05.771
so I made a few calls,
and it turns out it's true.

17:05.772 --> 17:07.771
I'm on my way back to Dawn's place

17:07.773 --> 17:09.272
to meet the previous owner,

17:09.275 --> 17:11.538
who tells me her husband died unexpectedly

17:11.540 --> 17:12.771
right inside the house.

17:19.679 --> 17:21.646
Let me ask you a question.

17:21.648 --> 17:23.814
Are you a little sad being back here?

17:23.816 --> 17:25.480
Just feel kind of funny.

17:25.482 --> 17:28.183
Funny? I feel like crying.

17:30.086 --> 17:31.818
How long did you guys live here for?

17:31.820 --> 17:33.520
We lived here a couple of years.

17:33.522 --> 17:35.223
Do you remember the
years that you were here?

17:35.225 --> 17:38.764
I think maybe around 2003.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.100
He passed away in 2005.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.169
He died in the house?

17:42.171 --> 17:44.909
He died in the master bathroom.

17:44.911 --> 17:47.179
Was it sudden?

17:47.181 --> 17:48.280
Yeah. Very sudden.

17:48.282 --> 17:51.483
He was 52, I believe.

17:51.485 --> 17:54.322
- Okay.
- I didn't find him right away.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.721
I was bringing in some of the groceries,

17:56.723 --> 17:58.155
and I thought it strange

17:58.157 --> 18:00.357
that he wasn't out there helping me.

18:00.359 --> 18:03.326
It was just a little unnerving

18:03.328 --> 18:05.163
when I kept calling his name...

18:05.165 --> 18:06.733
Okay.

18:06.735 --> 18:08.501
And he never responded.

18:08.503 --> 18:10.302
I'm sorry to bring this up.

18:10.304 --> 18:12.473
It's okay. Okay? Yeah?

18:12.475 --> 18:13.809
- You okay?
- Yeah.

18:13.811 --> 18:15.211
You sure? All right.

18:15.213 --> 18:16.312
I know this is tough,

18:16.314 --> 18:18.345
and I really appreciate you helping me.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.745
Thank you.

18:19.747 --> 18:21.113
What did he do for a living?

18:21.115 --> 18:25.119
He was a career soldier, 231/2 years.

18:25.121 --> 18:26.455
This is a picture

18:26.457 --> 18:29.958
when my husband came home from the Gulf War.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.861
What kind of guy was he?

18:31.863 --> 18:36.167
He was very fun-loving,
he liked to be the clown.

18:36.169 --> 18:38.169
Go to family reunions.

18:38.171 --> 18:40.307
This is one photo that we had taken,

18:40.309 --> 18:43.313
I believe it was on one of
our anniversaries in Hawaii.

18:43.315 --> 18:45.215
That's where we were stationed.

18:45.217 --> 18:48.619
I miss him a lot still.

18:48.621 --> 18:51.422
- I got to ask you an odd question.
- Okay.

18:51.424 --> 18:53.057
When you did live here,

18:53.059 --> 18:55.494
did you ever have anything happen here

18:55.496 --> 18:58.231
that you experienced that you can't explain?

18:58.233 --> 18:59.265
Mm-hmm. Yes.

18:59.267 --> 19:00.398
- You did.
- Definitely.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.266
I always felt somebody was staring at me.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.537
After he died,

19:04.539 --> 19:09.675
I could really feel like
maybe he was the one.

19:09.677 --> 19:10.744
You think maybe he was here

19:10.746 --> 19:11.979
right after he died in the house?

19:11.981 --> 19:14.447
I think so. Just for a little while.

19:14.449 --> 19:16.349
It was a good feeling with that.

19:18.217 --> 19:21.889
I feel like there is another shadow entity,

19:21.891 --> 19:24.893
like, crawling down the hallway.

19:24.895 --> 19:26.531
It's, like, really fast.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.768
In military they train you,

19:29.770 --> 19:33.005
like that movement when they're crawling.

19:33.007 --> 19:37.241
It's, like, nighttime,
somebody looking down the hall

19:37.243 --> 19:40.180
is seeing this thing
coming at them like this.

19:43.319 --> 19:48.621
He's confused about where he is.

19:48.623 --> 19:51.558
That's why I say military,
'cause it's almost like

19:51.560 --> 19:53.959
he's doing tactical assessing, you know?

19:53.961 --> 19:56.260
Like he doesn't know he's in a house.

19:56.262 --> 19:57.862
Do you know if he
interacts with the living?

19:57.864 --> 20:02.000
I saw this kid seeing a shadow person

20:02.002 --> 20:03.669
crawling down the hallway.

20:03.671 --> 20:07.975
Was in a crib.

20:07.977 --> 20:11.279
Probably two or three years old.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.880
Now,
in just about every investigation,

20:17.882 --> 20:19.380
I reach out to a local historian

20:19.382 --> 20:22.015
to see if they know anything
about my client's property.

20:22.017 --> 20:24.318
I just got a call from a local archivist

20:24.320 --> 20:26.186
who says he hit pay dirt.

20:26.188 --> 20:28.923
It seems the original owner
of Dawn's land suffered a lot.

20:28.925 --> 20:30.758
I'm heading over to meet with him now

20:30.760 --> 20:31.992
to see what he found out.

20:39.430 --> 20:41.196
Now, you mentioned on the phone

20:41.198 --> 20:43.364
that the original owners
of my client's property

20:43.366 --> 20:44.628
had a rough go of it.

20:44.630 --> 20:46.097
What do you know about them?

20:46.099 --> 20:49.467
The Utley family came here
around 1848 from New York State.

20:49.469 --> 20:51.135
More than likely, they're Methodist.

20:51.137 --> 20:53.737
John came out here with his wife,
Lydia, and their four children.

20:53.739 --> 20:55.172
Well, you mentioned they had
a tragic time on the land,

20:55.174 --> 20:56.508
what'd you mean?

20:56.510 --> 20:59.212
Well, they had 16 grandchildren
between the three sons.

20:59.214 --> 21:02.750
And six of them died fairly
young, before age 15.

21:02.752 --> 21:04.452
- That's a lot.
- That's quite a few.

21:04.454 --> 21:06.154
We do know that they had a set of twins,

21:06.156 --> 21:09.727
a boy and a girl,
and they died at age one day,

21:09.729 --> 21:11.431
no cause of death listed.

21:11.433 --> 21:12.800
Okay.

21:12.802 --> 21:14.802
And then a grandson, Clarence,

21:14.804 --> 21:19.410
who died at 15 years, 5 months from dropsy.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.043
All right. What about the other three?

21:21.045 --> 21:23.178
We have no idea.
They all died before death records.

21:23.180 --> 21:25.783
Well, that's a lot of tragedy
for just one family.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.918
Those weren't the only deaths.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.521
The one daughter-in-law died at age 41.

21:29.523 --> 21:31.389
Now, Michael,
you mentioned the original owners

21:31.391 --> 21:32.490
were John and Lydia.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.825
Now, what winded up happening to them?

21:33.827 --> 21:37.128
Lydia died in 1861. She was in her 60s.

21:37.130 --> 21:40.631
Then John dies, 1874. He's 86.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.132
We're talking about a lot of tragedy here.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.835
Talking about six grandchildren,
a daughter-in-law,

21:45.837 --> 21:48.706
and John and Lydia all
dying on the property.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.874
Yes, in a short period of time.

21:53.111 --> 21:57.051
I see this little woman.

21:57.053 --> 22:01.458
She's, like, very motherly...

22:01.460 --> 22:04.362
and very nurturing.

22:04.364 --> 22:11.071
She is thrilled that this is happening,

22:11.073 --> 22:14.442
which is strange, because she's religious.

22:14.444 --> 22:16.278
I want to say that she's Christian.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.281
She's excited that we're here.

22:18.283 --> 22:22.417
I think she had several sons.

22:22.419 --> 22:27.890
She says that the family...
her family was haunted.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.060
She thought, "Oh, it's a family curse."

22:32.062 --> 22:33.862
I thought that they were demons

22:33.864 --> 22:37.066
and that the family was for some reason

22:37.068 --> 22:39.568
being haunted or tormented by these things

22:39.570 --> 22:40.967
through the generations.

22:40.969 --> 22:44.303
She was just hoping and praying

22:44.305 --> 22:46.405
that it wouldn't happen to her sons,

22:46.407 --> 22:49.840
but now, you know, and now she feels bad,

22:49.842 --> 22:54.378
because it did, and it is,
and it's not gonna stop.

23:07.837 --> 23:10.438
I've already uncovered 10 people

23:10.440 --> 23:12.109
who died on Dawn's property,

23:12.209 --> 23:14.509
eight of them way too young,

23:14.511 --> 23:16.780
but I still need to see
if there's anything else

23:16.782 --> 23:18.447
that might help my investigation.

23:18.449 --> 23:20.913
Searching through the archives,

23:20.915 --> 23:23.250
I find one of Flint's most
notorious criminals...

23:23.252 --> 23:25.121
Tommie Nesbitt.

23:25.123 --> 23:28.392
Turns out he lived right next
door to my client's property.

23:30.062 --> 23:32.596
I don't know if it's
gonna help my case or not,

23:32.598 --> 23:34.766
but I got to know more about it.

23:34.768 --> 23:36.938
I made some calls,
and reached a retired detective

23:36.940 --> 23:39.440
who said he's gonna look into it for me.

23:44.079 --> 23:46.881
So, Robert,
what were you able to find out

23:46.883 --> 23:48.982
about this Tommie Nesbitt guy?

23:48.984 --> 23:50.383
He apparently likes to be in jail.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.383
Okay.

23:51.385 --> 23:53.888
He became a thief at the age of 12.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.756
He was caught stealing from orchards

23:56.758 --> 23:59.094
adjacent to his neighborhood.

23:59.096 --> 24:00.629
I got to assume we're not sitting here

24:00.631 --> 24:02.799
because this kid just stole fruit.

24:02.801 --> 24:05.000
No. But the crimes increased and escalated.

24:05.002 --> 24:06.768
By the time he was 13,

24:06.770 --> 24:09.171
he was sent away to juvenile hall.

24:09.173 --> 24:14.072
His first prison time was
for breaking into trains

24:14.074 --> 24:16.241
and stealing mittens and gloves.

24:16.243 --> 24:18.442
Once he got out of prison,
did he straighten out?

24:18.444 --> 24:21.610
No. He continued to commit crimes.

24:21.612 --> 24:26.047
In 1904,
Tommie robbed a hobo on one of the trains,

24:26.049 --> 24:29.184
and the train was moving,
and during the robbery,

24:29.186 --> 24:30.819
the hobo fell off the train

24:30.821 --> 24:33.986
and eventually died from his
injuries that he received.

24:33.988 --> 24:36.354
And he winds up in the fight,
throwing him off the train?

24:36.356 --> 24:37.356
Yep.

24:37.358 --> 24:39.526
And Tommie was charged with robbery

24:39.528 --> 24:45.400
and sent to Marquette
Prison for 5 to 25 years.

24:45.402 --> 24:47.270
He told the justice

24:47.272 --> 24:49.404
that he wanted to be a
world-class bank robber.

24:50.952 --> 24:52.519
How much time does he wind up doing?

24:52.619 --> 24:53.719
Seven years.

24:53.721 --> 24:54.955
- Seven years.
- Yes.

24:54.957 --> 24:56.157
All right, so do they parole him?

24:56.159 --> 24:58.962
Well, his mother became sick at that time,

24:58.964 --> 25:02.436
and when he was in prison he
learned he had tuberculosis,

25:02.438 --> 25:03.408
or TB.

25:03.508 --> 25:04.740
That was one of the
reasons they sent him home,

25:04.742 --> 25:07.310
both his mother was sick and he was sick.

25:07.312 --> 25:09.614
They spent a lot of time
talking about this kid,

25:09.616 --> 25:12.349
like he was a real famous criminal here.

25:12.351 --> 25:14.483
Well, he was famous.

25:14.485 --> 25:16.354
Some of the articles referred to it as,

25:16.356 --> 25:18.758
"Tommie's in jail again," or something,

25:18.760 --> 25:19.992
but first name only.

25:19.994 --> 25:21.863
So, what winds up happening to this guy?

25:21.865 --> 25:23.064
Well, he came home.

25:23.066 --> 25:26.170
And 30 days after that
or a month after that,

25:26.172 --> 25:28.842
his mother died from her disease.

25:28.844 --> 25:31.709
And in June of 1912, he died of TB.

25:31.711 --> 25:34.411
So, this kid was just born bad, basically?

25:34.413 --> 25:35.512
I would think so.

25:41.185 --> 25:44.454
I'm seeing the big violent guy again.

25:44.456 --> 25:48.323
This guy causes problems.

25:48.325 --> 25:53.026
He said he's a convict and a felon,
and he has a gun.

25:53.028 --> 25:54.661
He's spinning the gun.

25:54.663 --> 25:58.198
And he's like, "Aw,
sometimes you got to play the game."

25:58.200 --> 26:00.099
This big guy is the most advanced

26:00.101 --> 26:02.068
and dangerous entity in the house.

26:02.070 --> 26:05.105
I'm going back downstairs
to see if I can get

26:05.107 --> 26:08.540
any more information about
what he was like in life.

26:08.542 --> 26:10.977
He was a very violent person.

26:13.216 --> 26:15.350
He was always carrying a gun,

26:15.352 --> 26:17.717
you know,
he always had to take care of business.

26:29.099 --> 26:31.702
I encountered a lot of
dead people during my walk,

26:31.704 --> 26:34.676
but the dead woman
interacting with the living

26:34.678 --> 26:36.248
concerns me the most.

26:36.250 --> 26:41.054
There's two people in the bed,
and then there's a dead female

26:41.056 --> 26:43.791
who is in the bed in between them,

26:43.793 --> 26:49.229
but she's kind of cuddling
the person to the left.

26:49.231 --> 26:52.528
She has long hair. She's pretty thin.

26:52.530 --> 26:54.895
She has dark circles under her eyes,

26:54.897 --> 26:56.393
you know, sunken cheeks.

26:58.527 --> 27:00.526
Is this what you saw?

27:00.528 --> 27:03.995
Yes. That's what I saw.

27:23.860 --> 27:27.531
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:27.533 --> 27:29.066
we're ready to reveal our findings

27:29.068 --> 27:32.935
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

27:32.937 --> 27:35.070
Well, Amy, I'd like you to meet Dawn.

27:35.072 --> 27:36.307
This is her home. She lives here alone.

27:36.309 --> 27:38.911
Now,
the reason we're here is 'cause her son Ryan

27:38.913 --> 27:41.779
and her sister Cyndi are
really worried about her.

27:41.781 --> 27:43.280
She actually thinks that
something in this house

27:43.282 --> 27:44.513
is trying to take her sister's soul.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.151
Now, when I spoke to Dawn,
it seems like she was in denial,

27:48.153 --> 27:49.985
but the more I was talking to her,

27:49.987 --> 27:51.785
the more I think she's ready

27:51.787 --> 27:53.388
to face what's going on in this house,

27:53.390 --> 27:54.689
and meet it head-on and fight it.

27:54.691 --> 27:56.389
With that, I'm gonna have Amy tell us

27:56.391 --> 27:58.554
about what she saw on her walk.

28:02.625 --> 28:06.790
When I walked in the house,
I saw an elderly woman.

28:06.792 --> 28:10.126
She is extremely religious.

28:10.128 --> 28:13.564
She's very motherly, very nurturing.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.230
She said that she had several sons,

28:15.232 --> 28:16.831
that she was very proud of them.

28:16.833 --> 28:19.402
But she did have a regret,

28:19.404 --> 28:22.737
and that was not telling her sons

28:22.739 --> 28:26.072
that she felt their family
was being haunted by demons.

28:26.074 --> 28:29.378
And she didn't tell them

28:29.380 --> 28:32.579
because she was praying that
it wouldn't affect them.

28:32.581 --> 28:34.446
- It would go away.
- Right.

28:34.448 --> 28:38.083
And she feels guilty because it ended up

28:38.085 --> 28:42.121
that they too were seeing
and having experiences.

28:42.123 --> 28:46.257
Well, the only woman that
comes even close to that

28:46.259 --> 28:48.460
is the original owner of your property.

28:48.462 --> 28:49.562
A woman named Lydia Utley.

28:49.564 --> 28:51.430
She had several sons,

28:51.432 --> 28:53.697
and she was a religious woman...
she was Methodist.

28:53.699 --> 28:56.965
But there was some tragedy in her family.

28:56.967 --> 28:59.336
I came across a whole bunch of death records

28:59.338 --> 29:01.205
for the entire family.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.807
- Wow.
- Uh-huh.

29:02.809 --> 29:05.076
Now, the three sons that she did have

29:05.078 --> 29:10.447
all lost two kids each on this property.

29:10.449 --> 29:12.350
So she lost six grandchildren,

29:12.352 --> 29:14.353
five of them under the age of three.

29:14.355 --> 29:17.389
Now, one of the sons actually had a wife

29:17.391 --> 29:19.058
who died at the age of 41.

29:19.060 --> 29:20.961
His name was Asa.

29:20.963 --> 29:22.527
They all died on the property,
the whole family did.

29:22.529 --> 29:23.729
Oh, my gosh.

29:25.933 --> 29:31.936
Next,
I encountered a male who was tall and thin,

29:31.938 --> 29:36.809
and it seemed to me that he
seemed lost and confused.

29:36.811 --> 29:40.146
Didn't really know he was, like, in a house.

29:40.148 --> 29:42.616
And he was crawling down the hall,

29:42.618 --> 29:46.288
and I think because of how he
was doing what he was doing,

29:46.290 --> 29:50.559
he probably was military at some point.

29:50.561 --> 29:55.163
And also, I do think that it's very possible

29:55.165 --> 30:00.103
that the living might see
him as a shadow person.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.108
I was hoping this wasn't gonna happen,

30:03.110 --> 30:06.146
but you guys knew that the
previous homeowner died here.

30:06.148 --> 30:08.583
His name was Ron.

30:08.585 --> 30:12.122
I was able to talk to his wife
and actually meet her in person.

30:12.124 --> 30:15.260
Patsy and Ron wind up moving
into your house in 2003.

30:15.262 --> 30:17.727
Now, Ron wind up dying of
a massive heart attack

30:17.729 --> 30:20.733
suddenly on December 17, 2005.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.103
Amy, you mentioned he may be a military guy,

30:23.105 --> 30:25.640
well, Ron wind up serving
23 years in the Army.

30:25.642 --> 30:28.209
This is him here.

30:28.211 --> 30:31.715
When I talked to her,
she felt that she was still here

30:31.717 --> 30:33.148
'cause she stayed here
two years after he passed.

30:33.150 --> 30:37.318
What do you think about this guy?

30:37.320 --> 30:42.958
I never encountered him
here as a conscious entity.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.159
So, he might have moved on then.

30:44.161 --> 30:46.995
Now, you guys have theories about this guy,

30:46.997 --> 30:49.929
so at least now you have an
answer about what the deal was.

30:52.362 --> 30:53.528
So, what else?

30:53.530 --> 30:57.501
When I was in the basement,
there was a male.

30:57.503 --> 31:00.103
- He is a fairly big guy, bald.
- Oh, my gosh.

31:00.105 --> 31:04.973
And he's very solid for a dead person,

31:04.975 --> 31:07.810
and I saw him, like,
banging up against the walls,

31:07.812 --> 31:10.176
like, just like throwing a fit.

31:10.178 --> 31:13.410
So, I feel he can be a physical threat.

31:13.412 --> 31:16.311
He doesn't want to be here anymore,

31:16.313 --> 31:19.284
but he is trapped here.

31:19.286 --> 31:24.488
Sometimes he'll be interacting
with a living person here.

31:24.490 --> 31:27.790
So, like,
grabbing their arm or pulling them.

31:27.792 --> 31:29.926
So, he gets physical in the basement?

31:29.928 --> 31:31.264
Yeah.

31:31.266 --> 31:33.800
Well, you've been tugged, right?

31:33.802 --> 31:35.068
- Yes.
- Tell Amy about that.

31:35.070 --> 31:37.334
Dawn was showing me her basement,

31:37.336 --> 31:40.703
and I felt somebody grab
the back of my sweater

31:40.705 --> 31:42.806
and tug on it.

31:42.808 --> 31:45.676
And I turned around and
there was nothing there.

31:45.678 --> 31:47.742
And I was in the middle of the room.

31:47.744 --> 31:50.913
Now, tell Amy about the door incident.

31:50.915 --> 31:52.614
I came home in the middle of the day,

31:52.616 --> 31:54.114
and I heard a noise, the creaking noise,

31:54.116 --> 31:58.786
and I looked down and saw
the basement door opening.

31:58.788 --> 32:02.554
Didn't you see a shadow at
the bottom of the stairs?

32:02.556 --> 32:04.088
I was coming in the back door,

32:04.090 --> 32:05.822
and out of the corner of my eye I saw a man

32:05.824 --> 32:07.624
standing at the bottom of
the stairs looking up at me,

32:07.626 --> 32:09.058
like, waiting for me.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.959
What did he look like to you?

32:10.961 --> 32:13.829
He was just all... he was tall, big,

32:13.831 --> 32:16.369
and he just stood there
like he was something,

32:16.371 --> 32:18.737
- that, "I am here. I'm the boss."
- Mm-hmm.

32:18.739 --> 32:21.173
When I was upstairs,

32:21.175 --> 32:23.844
and I went into the guest bedroom,

32:23.846 --> 32:26.580
he was pissed.

32:26.582 --> 32:28.116
That's his area,

32:28.118 --> 32:30.452
and he does not like anybody in there.

32:30.454 --> 32:32.254
Basically, he said

32:32.256 --> 32:35.992
that anybody who comes
in there is gonna get it.

32:36.693 --> 32:38.827
I do see him, like, coming up

32:38.829 --> 32:41.994
and, like, you know, just, like, bam!

32:41.996 --> 32:43.798
Bam! Over and over and over and over.

32:43.800 --> 32:47.034
I think he's even lifted the bed.

32:47.036 --> 32:49.401
Amy,
the one thing I didn't mention to you

32:49.403 --> 32:52.103
is that Ryan here is actually a local cop.

32:52.105 --> 32:53.707
Now, being that he's a cop,

32:53.709 --> 32:56.076
I take his testimony a
little bit more seriously.

32:56.078 --> 32:58.043
Why don't you tell Amy what happened

32:58.045 --> 32:59.478
in the guest bedroom to you?

32:59.480 --> 33:01.281
It was about a 10- to 15-second situation...

33:01.283 --> 33:02.882
Okay.

33:02.884 --> 33:04.083
Where my hands were pinned...

33:04.085 --> 33:05.651
All right... up like this.

33:05.653 --> 33:06.985
Okay.

33:06.987 --> 33:10.524
He was looking at me, like,
"I can do this to you...

33:10.526 --> 33:14.291
and I am doing this to you,
and I'm gonna do it to you."

33:14.293 --> 33:17.028
- That sound like the guy?
- Yes.

33:17.030 --> 33:18.629
Do you know anything about him,
like, when he was alive?

33:18.631 --> 33:21.030
He told me that he was
a convict and a felon.

33:21.032 --> 33:23.334
Extremely violent and angry person.

33:23.336 --> 33:25.503
He kept showing me a gun

33:25.505 --> 33:29.742
that he always had on him,
never left his side.

33:29.744 --> 33:32.978
And he kind of indicated to me

33:32.980 --> 33:35.349
that he had done bad things with it.

33:35.351 --> 33:36.750
One guy comes to mind.

33:36.752 --> 33:38.485
I don't know if it fits or not,
but it's the guy

33:38.487 --> 33:40.223
that lived right next door on your property.

33:40.225 --> 33:42.426
This guy named Tommie Nesbitt.

33:46.062 --> 33:48.567
Career criminal. He's all over the papers.

33:48.569 --> 33:50.570
I mean, every cop in the town knew him.

33:50.572 --> 33:52.339
He winds up doing burglaries on the trains

33:52.341 --> 33:55.009
that went through here,
and then he robbed a hobo,

33:55.011 --> 33:58.213
a bum, and in the fight on the train

33:58.215 --> 34:01.283
he fell off the train,
and the guy wind up dying.

34:01.285 --> 34:02.684
He went to jail for that,

34:02.686 --> 34:03.884
but they didn't charge him with the murder,

34:03.886 --> 34:05.018
they only charged him with the robbery.

34:05.020 --> 34:06.919
Now, he wind up only doing seven years,

34:06.921 --> 34:08.754
and they did pardon him,

34:08.755 --> 34:10.955
but two of the reasons
were because he had TB,

34:10.956 --> 34:12.254
and his mother was dying.

34:12.255 --> 34:14.188
And when he was released,
he wind up coming back here,

34:14.190 --> 34:16.391
living with his mom right next door.

34:16.393 --> 34:18.493
Few months later he winds up dying of TB.

34:18.495 --> 34:20.960
He died in 1912.

34:20.962 --> 34:24.063
Kind of sounds like...

34:24.065 --> 34:26.264
- Uh-huh...
- this guy.

34:26.266 --> 34:28.266
You're not gonna sleep well tonight.

34:28.268 --> 34:31.636
I haven't.
I don't sleep well most of the time.

34:31.638 --> 34:33.103
- Anyways.
- I've been ignoring it,

34:33.106 --> 34:35.505
just hoping it would go away on its own.

34:35.507 --> 34:38.679
Yeah.
It's controlling her a little bit, I think.

34:39.581 --> 34:42.047
He's my biggest concern.

34:42.050 --> 34:45.386
He definitely does pose a real threat.

34:45.388 --> 34:47.989
I mean, in a physical sense.

34:47.992 --> 34:52.391
But he's fixated on getting out of here,

34:52.393 --> 34:56.331
and he thinks that the only way to do that

34:56.333 --> 34:59.600
at this point is that he
wants to destroy the house.

34:59.602 --> 35:04.374
And what he was showing
me was gas line and fire.

35:07.608 --> 35:09.575
He better hope I don't
pass away any time soon.

35:14.286 --> 35:16.554
Anything else?

35:16.556 --> 35:19.223
I went out into the backyard,

35:19.225 --> 35:21.692
and as soon as I walked out there,

35:21.694 --> 35:25.029
there were these really bad things

35:25.031 --> 35:28.097
that would cause accidents and problems

35:28.099 --> 35:29.829
and horrible things to happen to people.

35:29.831 --> 35:32.729
And what I saw was, like,

35:32.731 --> 35:38.338
all these, like,
kind of shapes in the trees and the brush.

35:38.340 --> 35:43.307
They are shape-shifters,
so they will project themselves

35:43.309 --> 35:46.477
in whatever manner will scare someone.

35:46.479 --> 35:47.844
It's really bad.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.581
They've caused a lot of accidents

35:50.583 --> 35:53.120
to happen to people here.

35:53.122 --> 35:55.122
Very bad things have
happened to people here.

35:55.124 --> 35:57.323
Well,
could that explain some of the deaths...

35:57.325 --> 35:58.993
the Utley's with their grandkids?

35:58.995 --> 36:00.263
That's what I'm thinking.

36:00.265 --> 36:03.500
Now, he won't bring his
18-month-old daughter here

36:03.502 --> 36:04.734
or his wife who's pregnant now.

36:04.736 --> 36:06.136
Yeah, no way.

36:06.138 --> 36:07.538
Yeah.

36:08.840 --> 36:14.445
These things,
they're capable of harming anyone.

36:19.687 --> 36:21.821
And I know it's got to be
bothering you a little bit,

36:21.823 --> 36:22.955
knowing what's here now.

36:22.957 --> 36:24.622
Not a little bit, a lot.

36:25.923 --> 36:29.725
I won't be
able to have Amore here.

36:36.097 --> 36:39.304
So, I ended up going into the storage room.

36:39.306 --> 36:43.205
Sitting there was this frail woman.

36:43.207 --> 36:45.777
She... extremely depressed.

36:45.779 --> 36:49.847
I think that you would feel
her stress and her sadness.

36:49.849 --> 36:53.016
So, what she does is she tries to come

36:53.018 --> 36:55.454
up to the master bedroom all the time.

36:55.456 --> 36:58.588
She wants to snuggle in the bed.

36:58.590 --> 37:00.259
She wants nurturing.

37:00.261 --> 37:03.028
You know, I felt very much like
she was acting like a child.

37:03.030 --> 37:04.562
Don't you feel people get on your bed?

37:04.564 --> 37:06.362
Right.

37:06.364 --> 37:08.199
But there's been times when I'm sleeping

37:08.201 --> 37:10.969
and I feel someone sitting on my bed.

37:10.971 --> 37:12.806
She's had a lot of experiences.

37:12.808 --> 37:15.507
I mean, she's even had a kiss.

37:15.509 --> 37:17.476
I just felt someone knelt down

37:17.478 --> 37:18.643
and just gave me a kiss goodnight.

37:19.979 --> 37:21.210
You never told me that.

37:21.212 --> 37:23.111
Could that have been this girl trying to...

37:23.113 --> 37:25.110
Yes.

37:25.112 --> 37:32.090
I did do a sketch of the
girl laying in the bed.

38:08.593 --> 38:14.958
I did do a sketch of the
girl laying in the bed.

38:39.973 --> 38:42.208
She looks very sad.

38:42.210 --> 38:44.976
This looks like a male.

38:44.978 --> 38:47.245
What I saw was a male and a female.

38:47.247 --> 38:48.513
Okay.

38:48.515 --> 38:50.214
And her cuddling with the
mommy and daddy figure,

38:50.216 --> 38:52.349
then she's doing with you, so...

38:52.351 --> 38:55.589
How does that make you feel,
that you're not alone in bed?

38:55.591 --> 38:56.890
Not good.

38:58.728 --> 39:01.762
It's more than what I expected.

39:09.702 --> 39:11.970
Well, Dawn, it's a good thing you have a son

39:11.972 --> 39:14.238
that worries about you so much,

39:14.240 --> 39:15.769
because if he didn't call us in when he did,

39:15.771 --> 39:17.370
we don't know what would
have happened to you.

39:17.372 --> 39:19.105
Question is, can you have a safe home

39:19.107 --> 39:21.307
and make this the place you want to live in,

39:21.309 --> 39:23.240
and live comfortably?

39:23.242 --> 39:25.007
So, for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:28.046 --> 39:32.050
For the things in the back,
they're some type of elemental,

39:32.052 --> 39:35.456
and basically an elemental is a being

39:35.458 --> 39:38.160
that never was in human form.

39:38.162 --> 39:41.263
They're not supposed to be bad,

39:41.265 --> 39:46.205
but I've encountered quite a few,

39:46.207 --> 39:53.073
and I have seen them not be
good towards living humans.

39:53.075 --> 39:55.844
So, I think that a shaman
should be brought in,

39:55.846 --> 40:01.151
and having them do a ritual
to set up a permanent boundary

40:01.153 --> 40:05.391
to keep those things at bay forever.

40:05.393 --> 40:08.558
Then you could bring the kids over.

40:08.560 --> 40:14.726
The second thing is to
have a psychic healer.

40:14.728 --> 40:19.361
So, this person needs to come and go down

40:19.363 --> 40:23.797
and talk to the girl in the storage room.

40:23.799 --> 40:27.703
Okay,
so this'll get this poor kid out of here.

40:27.705 --> 40:29.971
Yes.

40:29.973 --> 40:32.541
So, now once that happens,
will Dawn start feeling any better?

40:32.543 --> 40:33.710
Yeah.

40:33.712 --> 40:35.012
You won't get no more sitting on the bed,

40:35.014 --> 40:37.016
no more feeling depressed or isolated.

40:38.551 --> 40:44.022
And then,
the third thing is hiring a male medium,

40:44.024 --> 40:46.692
who's a tough guy, to come in,

40:46.694 --> 40:52.465
and he is going to engage crazy guy.

40:52.467 --> 40:55.903
He's going to, basically,
have to set this man straight,

40:55.905 --> 40:58.540
and move him on.

41:00.042 --> 41:01.943
The elderly woman,

41:01.945 --> 41:04.415
once everything has been dealt with

41:04.417 --> 41:08.318
and she doesn't feel like
there's a threat anymore,

41:08.320 --> 41:09.486
she'll leave.

41:11.089 --> 41:12.555
So, you got three major steps,

41:12.557 --> 41:14.922
but at the end of all of it,
you have your house back.

41:14.924 --> 41:16.391
I mean, do you feel better, Dawn?

41:16.393 --> 41:17.994
I just didn't expect all this.

41:17.996 --> 41:22.495
I'm just overwhelmed.
It's not a good feeling.

41:22.497 --> 41:26.232
I feel better.
I mean, based upon what she said.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.902
I mean, if it's fixable.

41:28.904 --> 41:31.372
Something breaks and you can fix it.

41:32.610 --> 41:35.044
That's the goal here,

41:35.046 --> 41:37.146
is for you to be happy in your own home,

41:37.148 --> 41:38.480
and for your grandchildren to come here

41:38.482 --> 41:40.415
and him feel okay about coming here.

41:40.417 --> 41:43.551
That is the goal.

41:43.553 --> 41:46.321
Sorry, Mom,
that I haven't brought her over more.

41:46.323 --> 41:47.923
You weren't paranoid.

41:47.925 --> 41:50.891
You had a good reason,
but we're gonna fix it.

41:50.893 --> 41:53.590
Dawn finally seems to understand

41:53.592 --> 41:56.156
just how active and dangerous her home is,

41:56.158 --> 41:59.326
but I believe if she follows my advice,

41:59.328 --> 42:01.563
she'll be able to live a peaceful life,

42:01.565 --> 42:04.064
where her family will
feel safe visiting her.
