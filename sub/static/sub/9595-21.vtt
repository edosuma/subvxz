Or coming home from work.

18:03.149 --> 18:06.217
Mm-hmm. Hey, is there anything
you'd like to talk about?

18:06.219 --> 18:09.153
Any conspiracies you'd like
to reveal?

18:09.155 --> 18:11.189
Uh...Not that I can
think of.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.256
You.

18:12.258 --> 18:16.861
Zoey's girlfriend daylen
having a penis.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.297
You didn't stand strong,
bow!

18:19.299 --> 18:22.166
[ sighs deeply ]
you're right.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.335
I'm sorry.
Okay, I just wanted --

18:24.337 --> 18:25.870
Yeah, admit it!
I --

18:25.872 --> 18:29.240
Admit that you just wanted
to be friends with her.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.842
Yeah, that's what
I was about to say.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.144
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. It was a part
of my apology.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.212
Oh, I didn't hear it.

18:34.214 --> 18:37.181
Okay? But she was
letting me back in,

18:37.183 --> 18:38.883
And I just couldn't resist.
So I...

18:38.885 --> 18:41.352
I gave her a couple of tips
about how to handle you.

18:41.354 --> 18:45.223
Since when have I needed
to be handled?

18:45.225 --> 18:47.325
Since you became
a crazy person?

18:47.327 --> 18:49.327
Mm-hmm.
Your heart is
in the right place,

18:49.329 --> 18:51.429
But you can be very scary.

18:51.431 --> 18:55.233
You were sitting in the dark,
waiting for a grown-ass woman.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.268
That's why the kids
come to me.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.336
Youse a scary man.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.872
I am not scary.

19:00.874 --> 19:04.142
I'm cuddly and lovable,
damn it!

19:04.144 --> 19:05.343
<i>This hit me hard.</i>

19:05.345 --> 19:07.445
<i>I needed to get</i>
<i>some outside opinions</i>

19:07.447 --> 19:09.881
<i>On whether</i>
<i>I was scary or not.</i>

19:09.883 --> 19:12.350
Hey, guys!
[ all scream ]

19:12.352 --> 19:15.186
Okay, I was just gonna ask
if I was scary, but...

19:15.188 --> 19:19.290
Are you sure you're just not
afraid of black dudes?

19:19.292 --> 19:21.259
Totally,
but you're a special case.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.427
I mean, just hearing you breathe
cures my hiccups.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.163
Yeah, it's you,<i> maing.</i>

19:25.165 --> 19:27.165
Hey, people who know me
know that

19:27.167 --> 19:29.367
I am a cuddly and lovable guy.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.169
Who can be a little hard
to talk to.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.904
And doesn't
take criticism well.

19:32.906 --> 19:37.175
All of the original artwork
you did for the buick pitch

19:37.177 --> 19:38.309
Said "biuck."

19:38.311 --> 19:39.911
What?
And I knew you'd

19:39.913 --> 19:41.913
Fly off the handle
if I pointed it out to you,

19:41.915 --> 19:44.248
So I asked charlie to change it
without telling you.

19:44.250 --> 19:48.452
"experience the new<i> biuck"?</i>
Charlie!

19:48.454 --> 19:51.455
I-I was s-scared to...
To ch-change it.

19:51.457 --> 19:54.325
<i>When people whose judgment</i>
<i>you don't trust at all</i>

19:54.327 --> 19:56.327
<i>Are still able to size you up,</i>

19:56.329 --> 19:58.196
<i>It's time to listen.</i>

19:58.198 --> 20:00.264
<i>So I decided to ease up a bit</i>

20:00.266 --> 20:02.266
<i>And let zoey go</i>
<i>to spring formal.</i>

20:02.268 --> 20:04.202
Now have fun, and remember,

20:04.204 --> 20:06.304
No vespas and no vaping.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.372
What?
I see everything.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.342
Dre, it's enough.
She learned her lesson.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.410
All right.
Rainbow: Bye, babe.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.945
Have fun!
[ chuckles ]

20:13.947 --> 20:15.246
[ car door closes ]

20:15.248 --> 20:16.948
Nice moment, huh?
Mm-hmm.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.950
Daughter off to
the spring formal

20:18.952 --> 20:21.252
With the blessing
of both her moms.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.420
What are you trying to say,
pops?

20:22.422 --> 20:24.422
I'm not trying to say anything.
I said it.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.489
Son, you're soft.
I --

20:25.491 --> 20:27.291
You're lady soft.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.427
You're
ladysoft black mambazo.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.296
So...Text me pictures.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.232
Text me stories.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.366
Just text me, okay?
Got it.

20:35.368 --> 20:39.003
That's funny.
My seat's so close.
[ whirring ]

20:39.005 --> 20:41.272
Ooh! Lumbar's off, too.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.573
Weird.

20:44.309 --> 20:47.545
Someone swapped my beck
for beyoncé?
[ seat belt clicks ]

20:52.517 --> 20:54.285
Get out of the car.

20:54.287 --> 20:57.521
Get...Out...Of...The car!
[ groans ]

20:57.523 --> 20:59.457
Are you kidding me?

20:59.459 --> 21:00.524
Zo-zo?
What's going on?

21:00.526 --> 21:02.493
She drove my car.
What?

21:02.495 --> 21:04.528
You know what? She is not going
to the spring formal.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.430
She's not leaving the house.
[ door closes ]

21:06.432 --> 21:08.332
She might not go to college.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.368
Zoey!
[ door opens ]

21:10.370 --> 21:11.535
[ lowered voice ] well, son,
looks like your wife decided

21:11.537 --> 21:13.571
To sac up and grow a pair,
huh?

21:13.573 --> 21:15.473
You're off the hook.

21:16.408 --> 21:17.608
Rainbow: Go to your room!

21:17.610 --> 21:19.844
I do not want to see
your face! Ugh!
