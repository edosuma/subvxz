21:21.313 --> 21:22.803
<i>Previously on "Sports Night"...</i>

21:22.882 --> 21:24.976
I was just wondering
if Dana would have a problem

21:25.050 --> 21:27.018
if I took a few days off
next week.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.679
-- What's going on?
-- Oh, it's nothing.

21:28.754 --> 21:30.244
What's going on?

21:31.357 --> 21:33.018
My parents
might be splitting up.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.617
-- I knew I knew you.
-- Yes.

21:34.693 --> 21:37.060
-- You're Steve Siscds wife.
-- Ex-wife.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.995
I've had experience
with sportscasters.

21:39.064 --> 21:41.226
-- What kind of experience?
-- I was married to one.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.290
-- Ah.
-- Yes.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.100
<i>Kim: Five minutes to air.</i>

21:47.173 --> 21:48.868
<i>First team in the studio,
please.</i>

21:48.941 --> 21:50.670
<i>Five minutes.</i>

21:50.743 --> 21:51.938
-- I'm pumped.
-- Me too.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.479
-- I'm pumped up.
-- Excellent.

21:53.546 --> 21:54.980
-- Aren't you pumped?
-- I am.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.344
-- I'm ready.
-- Excellent.

21:56.415 --> 21:57.473
Five minutes to air.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.644
The best words
in the English language.

21:59.718 --> 22:00.810
-- Aren't they?
-- Yes.

22:00.886 --> 22:03.355
They're the best words
in the English language.

22:03.422 --> 22:05.254
<i>Cinq minutes
avant d'etre en direct.</i>

22:05.324 --> 22:06.758
Those are the best words
in the French language.

22:06.825 --> 22:07.986
-- Yes.
-- <i>Our'.</i>

22:08.060 --> 22:09.926
<i>Cfnco mfnutos

22:09.995 --> 22:11.690
This is what
I'm talking about.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.254
-- There's an internal clock.
-- There is.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.822
-- It's like athletes.
-- It's just like that.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.664
-- When that gun goes off...
-- When the bell rings...

22:16.735 --> 22:18.703
-- It's game time, my friend!
-- You can take it to the bank!

22:18.771 --> 22:20.205
The most beautiful sound
in the world.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.740
<i>Fun!' min uten

22:21.807 --> 22:23.536
-- Now you're just showing off.
-- Yeah.

22:23.609 --> 22:25.077
-- Good show, guys.
-- Good show, Kim.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.669
Did Orlando Rojas pitch
this afternoon?

22:26.745 --> 22:27.678
I do not know.

22:27.746 --> 22:29.180
-- You don't know?
-- I do not.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.580
Natalie, did Orlando Rojas
pitch this afternoon?

22:31.650 --> 22:32.776
That's a good question.

22:32.851 --> 22:33.818
Thank you very much.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.376
Did he pitch this afternoon?

22:35.454 --> 22:36.387
I do not know.

22:36.455 --> 22:38.082
Thank God none of us work
in sports.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.421
Hey, neither of you have heard
from Jeremy, have you?

22:40.492 --> 22:41.789
-- Since he left? Nope.
-- Yeah.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.555
You haven't heard from him?

22:43.629 --> 22:45.393
I heard from him the first night, but
not the second night and not tonight.

22:45.464 --> 22:46.590
Did you call
his parents' house?

22:46.665 --> 22:48.326
-- I <i>left</i> a <i>message.</i>
-- <i>Maybe he's just busy.</i>

22:48.400 --> 22:49.526
Yeah.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.434
Maybe he met another woman
and forgot all about you.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.232
Maybe I'll jam a number-2 pencil
up your nose.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.431
Maybe he's just busy.

22:54.506 --> 22:55.564
Maybe that's right.

22:55.641 --> 22:56.972
<i>Dave: 60 seconds to VTR.</i>

22:57.042 --> 22:58.942
-- Two minutes live.
-- This is a heads-up.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.480
We're two hours in front of
Baja California right now.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.174
We're three hours in front.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.910
Baja California isn't on
daylight savings time.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.816
Everybody in the country's
on daylight savings time.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.649
Baja California
isn't in this country.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.587
California
isn't in this country?

23:10.656 --> 23:13.125
Baja California isn't in California.
It's in Mexico.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.126
Baja California
is in Mexico?

23:15.194 --> 23:16.662
-- Yeah.
-- What kind of stupid-ass --

23:16.729 --> 23:17.662
I'm just saying heads-up.

23:17.730 --> 23:18.993
"Sports Night" is at ready-1.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.930
-- I'm pumped.
-- 30 seconds to VTR.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.832
<i>Dave: Live in 90.
-- I'm pumped.</i>

23:22.901 --> 23:24.266
Why wouldn't he call me?

23:24.336 --> 23:25.735
His parents are splitting up,
Natalie.

23:25.804 --> 23:27.135
He's got some stuff going on.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.674
-- <i>Yeah,</i> but --
-- He'll be back tomorrow.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.140
-- You know what you should do?
-- Yeah...what?

23:30.209 --> 23:31.643
-- Get pumped.
-- Yeah.

23:31.710 --> 23:32.802
I'm pumped.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.937
<i>Dave: Roll VTR.
-- Dave, are you pumped?</i>

23:35.014 --> 23:36.448
-- What the hell is she --
-- She's pumped.

23:36.515 --> 23:38.040
-- Are you pumped?
-- I am.

23:38.117 --> 23:38.845
Oh. That's great.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.975
Elliott...

23:40.052 --> 23:41.611
<i>did Orlando Rojas pitch
this afternoon?</i>

23:41.687 --> 23:42.779
He's pitching tomorrow.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.414
<i>Did he pitch
in the bullpen yesterday?</i>

23:44.490 --> 23:46.083
Yeah. Kelly was there,
and she saw him throw.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.353
How'd his fastball look?

23:47.426 --> 23:49.155
Should be crossing the plate
any minute now.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.390
You guys are all set.
Have a good show.

23:51.463 --> 23:52.988
We will have a good show,
Alyson, you know why?

23:53.065 --> 23:54.157
'Cause you're pumped?

23:54.233 --> 23:55.132
'Cause we're pumped.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.133
Dan's pretty excited.

23:56.201 --> 23:57.464
Casey's speaking in tongues.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.800
Alyson, did you know I speak
four languages?

23:59.872 --> 24:01.135
You speak three languages.

24:01.206 --> 24:02.503
I speak four languages.

24:02.574 --> 24:03.837
You speak French, Spanish,
and German.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.240
I dabble
in a little English.

24:05.311 --> 24:07.473
What were we talking about?

24:07.546 --> 24:08.980
I was hoping you'd know.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.675
-- The point is we're pumped.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

24:10.749 --> 24:12.012
Do I have to keep
standing here?

24:12.084 --> 24:13.074
-- No. Go get pumped.
-- Okay.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.551
You know what pumps me up?

24:14.620 --> 24:16.088
I know you like grape jelly.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.520
Orlando Rojas.

24:17.589 --> 24:19.819
Orlando Rojas pumps me up.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.724
It's just strange that
he hasn't called me.

24:21.794 --> 24:22.727
He's okay.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.354
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

24:24.430 --> 24:26.421
Good evening.
From New York City,

24:26.498 --> 24:28.762
I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall.

24:28.834 --> 24:31.394
Those stories, plus we'll bring
you the madness of March

24:31.470 --> 24:33.336
and a mayday from Missouri.

24:33.405 --> 24:36.807
We'll show you why McKenzie
Blane falls mainly on Tulane,

24:36.875 --> 24:39.503
and we'll do other things
that rhyme as well.

24:39.578 --> 24:40.875
All that coming up after this.

24:40.946 --> 24:44.473
You're watching “Sports Night“
on CSC, so stick around.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.018
<i>Dave." We're out.</i>

24:51.056 --> 24:52.751
<i>Dan: Orlando Rojas.</i>

24:52.825 --> 24:54.350
I don't know who that is.

24:54.426 --> 24:55.757
Orlando Rojas the pitcher.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.796
-- Oh, Orlando Rojas the pitcher.
-- Yes.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.058
I don't know who that is.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.599
He's pitching this afternoon.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.031
-- Orlando Rojas?
-- Yes.

25:02.101 --> 25:02.932
I don't know who that is.

25:03.001 --> 25:03.991
That's hard to believe.

25:04.069 --> 25:06.060
I took an elevator
up 12 floors, Dan.

25:06.138 --> 25:07.606
What did you want to tell me?

25:07.673 --> 25:08.970
I wanted to tell you that

25:09.041 --> 25:11.203
Orlando Rojas is pitching
this afternoon.

25:11.276 --> 25:12.402
You couldn't tell me that
on the phone?

25:12.478 --> 25:14.037
Well, you don't like it
when I bother you at work.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.878
Hey, is it okay if I hit you
in the head with this big book?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.940
-- That's Casey's.
-- Oh.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.451
Casey, is it okay
if I hit Dan in the head

25:20.519 --> 25:21.953
-- with this big book?
<i>Casey:</i> Yep.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.613
-- She doesn't know who Orlando Rojas is.
-- He's a pitcher.

25:23.689 --> 25:24.918
He's pitching this afternoon.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.355
-- <i>Orlando Rojas?</i>
-- <i>You guys, seriously,</i>

25:26.425 --> 25:28.587
I'm just gonna sit down in the
middle of the room and cry.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.287
11 years ago, he pitched
a perfect game.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.352
A perfect game?

25:31.430 --> 25:32.420
Yes, ma'am.

25:32.498 --> 25:33.465
And a perfect game is good?

25:33.532 --> 25:35.626
Listen, I know there's
a lot of jargon,

25:35.701 --> 25:38.102
but some of these
are pretty self-explanatory.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.865
I have to go back
to my office.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.477
How could you have been married to Steve Sisoo
all those years and know nothing about sports?

25:46.545 --> 25:48.980
It wasn't “all those years, Dan.
It was 2 1/2 years.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.015
Yeah, but they were 2 1/2
Steve Sisco years.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.847
That's like 25 regular years.

25:52.918 --> 25:55.353
You think Neil Armstrong's wife
is an expert in astropropulsion?

25:55.421 --> 25:58.152
-- I think she's heard of the moon. --
Sports isn't what I do for a living.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.691
-- What <i>do</i> you do for a living?
-- What?

25:59.758 --> 26:01.658
-- What do you do exactly?
-- You know exactly what I do.

26:01.727 --> 26:02.888
-- You're a market analyst.
-- Yes.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.793
-- What does that mean?
-- I analyze the market.

26:04.863 --> 26:06.797
-- Keep going.
-- It's hard to understand, Dan.

26:06.865 --> 26:08.333
I'm a very smart guy, Rebecca.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.630
I analyze conditions and trends
and make recommendations

26:10.702 --> 26:12.670
to protect and improve
this company's position

26:12.738 --> 26:14.263
in the global
financial community.

26:14.339 --> 26:15.670
That's what I do.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.573
-- You don't really know, do you?
-- I do too know.

26:17.643 --> 26:20.374
It was your husband's life. You never
even had a passing interest in it?

26:20.446 --> 26:22.744
I'm just saying I know precisely
what I do for a living, okay?

26:22.815 --> 26:24.613
I happen to be a graduate
of the Wharton School.

26:24.683 --> 26:26.617
[Chuckling]

26:28.854 --> 26:30.049
What?

26:30.122 --> 26:31.886
Could you say
that part again --

26:31.957 --> 26:34.551
"I happen to be a graduate
of the Wharton School"?

26:34.626 --> 26:36.526
Have people ever tried
to kill you?

26:36.595 --> 26:39.087
Yeah, but I defend myself with
my superior wit and guile.

26:39.164 --> 26:42.600
I'm going back to my office.

26:42.668 --> 26:44.261
-- Hey, guess what.
-- [ Sighs ] What?

26:44.336 --> 26:46.805
-- Orlando Rojas is pitching
this afternoon. -- I heard.

26:46.872 --> 26:48.237
-- Watch the game with me.
-- Nope.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.038
It'll be great. I'll tape it.
We can watch it later tonight.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.543
-- No.
-- Why?

26:52.611 --> 26:55.012
'Cause you like me right now,
and you love sports,

26:55.080 --> 26:57.947
and I think when you see those two things
in a room together at the same time,

26:58.016 --> 27:00.007
I'm gonna look a little less
like what you want.

27:00.085 --> 27:01.382
I think you're wrong.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.444
I have to go back
to my office.

27:03.522 --> 27:06.787
First of all, what makes you
so sure I like you right now?

27:06.859 --> 27:09.453
VVell, you follow me everywhere I go,
and you ask me out all the time.

27:09.528 --> 27:11.895
You're reading way too much into that. See,
you may have attended the Wharton School,

27:11.964 --> 27:14.831
but I graduated from a little
institution called Dartmouth,

27:14.900 --> 27:16.265
and I took Psych 101,

27:16.335 --> 27:18.827
and, on one or two occasions,
I went to class,

27:18.904 --> 27:21.373
so I know all about the likes
of you, Miss Missy.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.738
You built yourself a wall,
a wall of pain,

27:23.809 --> 27:25.834
a wall whose bricks
are made of pain

27:25.911 --> 27:28.403
and whose mortar is made
of tears and whose --

27:28.480 --> 27:31.142
What's the other one?
There's bricks and mortar --

27:31.216 --> 27:32.377
-- That's it.
-- Really?

27:32.451 --> 27:34.146
-- Just bricks and mortar.
-- There isn't a third thing?

27:34.219 --> 27:35.152
Nope.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.881
Whatever.
You've got a wall.

27:36.955 --> 27:39.014
I'm going back to my world now.

27:39.091 --> 27:42.425
I'm gonna tear that wall down,
Rebecca, bit by little bit.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.427
Okay. Bye.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.760
I'm gonna tear it down...

27:46.832 --> 27:47.993
for I am Dan,

27:48.066 --> 27:51.366
doer of good things
where women are concerned.

27:51.436 --> 27:53.837
[Chuckles]

27:53.906 --> 27:56.170
How you all doin'?

27:56.241 --> 27:57.970
We're just friends.

27:58.043 --> 27:59.977
<i>Uh, that's Goodwin</i> --

28:00.045 --> 28:02.036
Jeremy Goodwin -- and I'm
not looking for topography,

28:02.114 --> 28:03.513
just the general
nautical make-up.

28:03.582 --> 28:04.674
I need a chart.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.184
You're back!

28:06.251 --> 28:07.650
-- Yeah.
-- Hey!

28:07.719 --> 28:10.416
Hey. Right, no that area's
way too far north, though.

28:10.489 --> 28:13.288
-- My man has come back to me!
-- And what I need is a chart.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.258
Did you get
my "Welcome Back" card?

28:15.327 --> 28:17.261
Right.
That was really nice. Thanks.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.264
I need a chart of that area
where the storm hit.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.128
It says "Welcome Back"
in big letters,

28:21.166 --> 28:24.067
and then there's a drawing of me holding
a sign that says “Welcome Back.“

28:24.136 --> 28:26.127
Uh, about 600 nautical miles
from the start buoy.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.399
So it's actually two cards.

28:27.472 --> 28:29.338
Okay, would you call me
at this number, please?

28:29.408 --> 28:31.536
There's also, as you can see,
a box of Good & Plentys.

28:31.610 --> 28:33.772
Thank you.
Thank you.

28:33.845 --> 28:35.870
-- You're back. -- I'm sorry
I didn't call last night.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.279
-- Or the night before.
-- Right, but --

28:37.349 --> 28:38.407
Do you want to know
how good I am?

28:38.483 --> 28:39.814
I'm not even gonna ask
why you didn't call.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.319
Thank you, 'cause what I
really gotta do right now --

28:41.386 --> 28:43.115
Why the hell didn't you call?

28:43.188 --> 28:45.156
You know, it was just
one of those things.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.247
I get it.

28:46.325 --> 28:47.588
-- Do you? Thank you.
-- Yeah.

28:47.659 --> 28:48.524
Why the hell didn't you call?

28:48.594 --> 28:50.289
-- Natalie.
-- [Telephone rings]

28:50.362 --> 28:51.852
Jeremy Goodwin.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.898
Yeah, I need a chart.

28:53.966 --> 28:58.426
Because I'm trying to figure out
how it happened.

28:58.503 --> 29:01.632
It's the big box
of Good & Plenty.

29:04.042 --> 29:05.476
[Sighs]

29:05.544 --> 29:08.138
[Tapping]

29:12.050 --> 29:15.145
There is a rundown meeting,
right?

29:15.220 --> 29:16.153
Yes.

29:16.221 --> 29:18.315
'Cause it was kind of hard
not to notice

29:18.390 --> 29:20.324
that we're
the only two people here.

29:20.392 --> 29:24.351
-- See, the thing about me
is I'm well-rounded. -- Yes.

29:24.429 --> 29:27.160
-- For instance, I speak
many languages. -- Yes.

29:27.232 --> 29:29.394
And I can juggle,
play a little piano.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.232
I need this meeting
to get underway.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.294
I want people to walk
in the door right now.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.362
[Door opens]

29:38.710 --> 29:39.973
Look at that.

29:40.045 --> 29:42.480
That's a power
I didn't even know I had.

29:42.547 --> 29:44.311
Good afternoon, everybody.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.818
Will, you're sitting
in Isaac's chair.

29:46.885 --> 29:48.512
I thought Isaac wasn't here.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.021
You don't sit in Isaac's chair
when Isaac isn't here.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.852
All right!

29:51.923 --> 29:53.288
Let's go.
No foolin' around.

29:53.358 --> 29:55.122
We've got nine items
for this meeting,

29:55.193 --> 29:57.025
and we're just gonna go
bam, bam, bam --

29:57.095 --> 29:58.859
no interruptions.
I think we can do it.

29:58.930 --> 30:01.831
I'm feeling really good about
this meeting so far. I'm serious.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.801
I'm getting a really good vibe
from this meeting, so here we go.

30:04.870 --> 30:07.464
-- Ready, Elliott? [Snaps
fingers] Item one -- -- Dana...

30:07.539 --> 30:08.836
-- <i>Oh, this meeting sucks.</i>
-- <i>Just one thing.</i>

30:08.907 --> 30:09.999
This is for everybody.

30:10.075 --> 30:11.543
I'm gonna be taping
the Orioles game,

30:11.610 --> 30:13.738
and I'm not gonna be watching it
till the show comes down.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.840
Under no circumstances do I want to know the
outcome of the game or how Rojas pitched.

30:17.916 --> 30:20.248
I want to share a sports
experience with Rebecca,

30:20.318 --> 30:22.685
and I don't want to know
anything about this game.

30:22.754 --> 30:24.415
That's a bit problematic.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.856
-- <i>Why?</i> -- <i>'Cause I
understand that it's our job</i>

30:26.925 --> 30:29.223
to get the information
and report it to others.

30:29.294 --> 30:30.557
I've got that all covered.

30:30.629 --> 30:31.562
Can we get started?

30:31.630 --> 30:32.859
First of all,
you take the Orioles game.

30:32.931 --> 30:34.330
Elliott,
you reroute the LC wire

30:34.399 --> 30:36.925
so that I'm not getting American
League scores in my office.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.902
Kim, please pass this along
to the staff

30:38.970 --> 30:42.031
and have them establish a signal they
can give me if I'm approaching danger.

30:42.107 --> 30:43.541
Once the American League
wrap-up starts,

30:43.608 --> 30:45.474
I need to be outfitted
with a blindfold and a Walkman,

30:45.544 --> 30:46.943
and, just to be on
the safe side, Dana,

30:47.012 --> 30:48.776
you better put a Hefty bag
over the floor monitors.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.440
Kill me.
Kill me now.

30:50.515 --> 30:51.539
Here we go.
Item one, Elliott.

30:51.616 --> 30:52.742
-- <i>Yes!</i>
-- <i>I have something.</i>

30:52.818 --> 30:54.946
We print these rundowns --

30:55.020 --> 30:57.352
tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of
the wreck of the Sword of Orion.

30:57.422 --> 30:58.912
It happened during
the Governor's Cup.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.719
Jeremy, I didn't even see you there.
When did you get back?

31:00.792 --> 31:02.191
I took the train down
this morning.

31:02.260 --> 31:03.921
What's the Governor's Cup?

31:03.995 --> 31:05.759
It's a sailboat race
from New York to Nassau.

31:05.831 --> 31:08.323
10 years ago,
a 68-foot merit-class yacht

31:08.400 --> 31:11.461
called the <i>Sword</i> of Orion,
which was favored to win,

31:11.536 --> 31:14.062
went massively and inexplicably
off course

31:14.139 --> 31:18.201
<i>and into the path of winds gusting up
to 90 miles per hour with 30-foot seas.</i>

31:18.276 --> 31:22.543
The taotician, who was the son of the boat's
owner, was thrown overboard and drowned.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.708
<i>The rest of the crew was saved
four days later.</i>

31:24.783 --> 31:26.410
I'd like to do a feature.

31:26.485 --> 31:29.250
<i>I thought I could piece together
what happened on the boat.</i>

31:29.321 --> 31:31.312
I'm gonna do interviews
with four of the crew members,

31:31.389 --> 31:34.916
<i>I've got two of the captain's logs as
well as other support information.</i>

31:34.993 --> 31:37.621
What I'm having trouble with
is getting the right charts.

31:37.696 --> 31:40.495
I need the right charts and I
need to learn how to read them.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.091
I'm confident I can, that I can
learn how to read them.

31:43.168 --> 31:45.136
Anyway, I'd like to do
a feature, Dana.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.332
I'm done.
That's all I had to say.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.774
I don't know if --

31:52.844 --> 31:54.209
It's a good idea, Dana.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.574
Okay. Yeah.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.084
<i>Keep Natalie posted.</i>

32:00.152 --> 32:02.450
<i>Item one...</i>

32:06.992 --> 32:09.427
<i>Yes, but I never said I was
gonna watch it with you.</i>

32:09.494 --> 32:10.928
It seemed like you
secretly wanted to.

32:10.996 --> 32:12.555
-- I didn't.
-- There was an understanding.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.360
-- There wasn't. -- There
was a tacit understanding.

32:14.432 --> 32:15.729
-- Hey, Dan.
-- Hey, Celia.

32:15.801 --> 32:18.771
<i>You're telling me you never
watched a game with Steve Sisco?</i>

32:18.837 --> 32:20.396
Could you stop calling him
Steve Sisco?

32:20.472 --> 32:22.270
The way you use his full name
drives me crazy.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.035
In fact, everything you do
drives me crazy.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.042
-- Hey, Dan.
-- Hey, Stuart.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.373
How is it you've become buddies

32:26.444 --> 32:27.809
with everyone
who works down here?

32:27.879 --> 32:30.041
I have a way about me.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.480
For you are Dan.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.314
For I am.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.978
Why is this game
so important to you?

32:35.053 --> 32:37.078
Orlando Rojas is pitching.

32:37.155 --> 32:38.987
And he's really good?

32:39.057 --> 32:40.081
We don't know yet.

32:40.158 --> 32:42.991
He's been out for two years after
shoulder surgery and rehab.

32:43.061 --> 32:45.325
I've interviewed him a few times.
You'd like him a lot.

32:45.397 --> 32:46.956
And he's really
one of the good guys.

32:47.032 --> 32:49.000
-- What team does he play for?
-- The Orioles.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.263
An oriole
is a kind of bird.

32:51.336 --> 32:53.270
There's nothing about you
I don't hate.

32:53.338 --> 32:55.397
-- And yet you're mysteriously
drawn to me. -- Yes.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.464
Come to my office at midnight. I won't
know anything about the game yet.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.135
What happens if they win?

32:59.211 --> 33:00.542
-- The Orioles? Nothing.
-- Yes.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.376
-- Nothing happens if
they win the game? -- No.

33:02.447 --> 33:03.846
They don't go
to the championship?

33:03.915 --> 33:05.440
No, actually, the season
hasn't started yet.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.679
It's what's called
an exhibition game.

33:07.752 --> 33:09.948
They play about 30 of them before
the season starts as a tuneup.

33:10.021 --> 33:11.750
Then why does everyone care
who wins?

33:11.823 --> 33:15.225
Nobody cares who wins, but if Orlando
Rojas can put some innings together,

33:15.293 --> 33:18.729
he may not get out from the team as
quickly as most people think he's gonna.

33:18.797 --> 33:22.028
There's really nothing like seeing
a guy realize he's not done yet.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.933
Usually it goes the other way.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.664
Watch the game with me.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.799
Dan, it's been a long week. I just don't
think I can wait around till midnight.

33:29.875 --> 33:33.004
I'm gonna get this stuff done and go home,
probably take a bath, and go to sleep.

33:33.078 --> 33:34.477
-- You sure?
-- Yeah.

33:34.546 --> 33:37.038
Should I stop trying
to sell you?

33:37.115 --> 33:38.480
-- Yes.
-- Really?

33:38.550 --> 33:39.779
_- YEP-
_. OKaV-

33:39.851 --> 33:41.478
Thanks.

33:41.553 --> 33:42.748
Let me try to sell you.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.016
Dan.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.956
I knew that deep down you wanted
me to try and sell you.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.618
-- Hey, Dan. -- Hey, Phil.
What do you say?

33:48.693 --> 33:53.358
All right! Everybody, please,
stop being friendly to Dan!

33:53.431 --> 33:56.457
Number one,
there'll be pretzels.

33:58.670 --> 33:59.831
<i>Jeremy:
400 miles into the race,</i>

33:59.905 --> 34:02.067
<i>they were still all within
sight of each other,</i>

34:02.140 --> 34:04.404
but on the fifth night,
around sunset,

34:04.476 --> 34:07.502
Southern <i>Cross</i> logged that
they'd lost visual contact

34:07.579 --> 34:10.047
with <i>the Sword of Orion
right around here.</i>

34:10.114 --> 34:11.446
Two hours later,

34:11.516 --> 34:14.076
<i>Practical Knowledge had
lost sight of them as well.</i>

34:14.152 --> 34:16.120
They tacked east
working off a report

34:16.187 --> 34:19.088
that called for 40-knot winds
out of the south-southwest.

34:19.157 --> 34:22.353
They were right here when
all their on board computers,

34:22.427 --> 34:25.886
including the SatNav radar,
malfunctioned.

34:25.964 --> 34:27.898
And not only did they not know
where they were,

34:27.966 --> 34:31.425
they had no way of knowing that the call for
40-knot winds was off by more than half.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.402
So, it was a few minutes
past midnight --

34:33.471 --> 34:35.803
Hey, Jeremy, did, uh,
something happen on this trip

34:35.873 --> 34:38.103
you want to talk about?
Something happen at home?

34:38.176 --> 34:40.076
No. Just my parents
are getting divorced.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.112
I know.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.079
So, I mean, it is what it is.

34:43.148 --> 34:44.616
Yeah.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.879
Anyway, it was a few minutes
past midnight

34:46.952 --> 34:48.920
when the <i>Sword</i> of <i>Orion</i>
turned again,

34:48.987 --> 34:50.955
making a course
for 82 degrees south,

34:51.022 --> 34:54.889
and that was the last mistake
they'd have a chance to make.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.893
[Telephone ringing]

34:56.962 --> 34:59.260
Uh, I'd like to audition
these graphics in the 30s

34:59.331 --> 35:00.856
and leave time for any changes.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.161
Would you put them up, Dave?

35:02.233 --> 35:03.632
Yeah, I'll put them up
on the monitor,

35:03.702 --> 35:05.431
but I think you might want
to let us do the talking.

35:05.503 --> 35:06.800
Why?

35:06.871 --> 35:09.067
You frighten the people
in graphics.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.369
-- <i>No,</i> I <i>don't.</i>
-- <i>Yes, you do.</i>

35:10.442 --> 35:11.967
The people in graphics
are my friends.

35:12.043 --> 35:13.909
-- That's not quite right.
-- I'm so nice to them.

35:13.979 --> 35:15.378
That's one way
of looking at it.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.710
What's another way?

35:16.781 --> 35:18.772
That oftentimes you express
your displeasure with their work

35:18.883 --> 35:20.612
in ways that make them want
to take their own lives.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.916
<i>I absolutely do not.</i>

35:22.988 --> 35:24.285
Talk to us,
let us talk to them.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.154
-- I'm perfectly nice.
-- Dana.

35:26.224 --> 35:28.090
-- Watch how nice I can be.
-- Dana.

35:28.159 --> 35:30.594
Fine. Show me 30.
You'll see how nice I can be.

35:30.662 --> 35:31.595
30's up.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.223
Oh, <i>that</i> blows!

35:34.299 --> 35:35.596
Yeah, she's not wild about it.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.294
Back here at 10:00.

35:40.905 --> 35:42.703
Anyway, I wouldn't worry
about it.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.674
He's acting very strange
today, Dana.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.871
It's honestly not like him
not to call me,

35:46.945 --> 35:49.107
and he didn't respond
to the Good & Plenty,

35:49.180 --> 35:51.239
and it was the big box
of Good & Plenty,

35:51.316 --> 35:53.910
and what's up with his obsession
with this boat race?

35:53.985 --> 35:56.420
-- I wouldn't call it an obsession.
-- No, it is.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.388
Is his father still living
at home?

35:58.456 --> 35:59.651
No, he's at a motel now.

35:59.724 --> 36:01.624
Is Jeremy very close
to his father?

36:01.693 --> 36:03.821
Jeremy worships his father.
He's the sweetest man.

36:03.895 --> 36:06.990
It shouldn't be too hard to understand
why Jeremy isn't in the best mood.

36:07.065 --> 36:08.226
He's not telling me something.

36:08.299 --> 36:10.495
-- Jeremy?
-- Yeah.

36:10.568 --> 36:11.967
Don't worry about it.

36:12.037 --> 36:14.972
Yeah.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.532
Hey...

36:17.609 --> 36:19.407
The people in graphics
are afraid of me?

36:19.477 --> 36:20.467
Yeah.

36:20.545 --> 36:23.344
Excellent.

36:23.415 --> 36:26.214
<i>These fingers wrap around
these two seams.</i>

36:26.284 --> 36:28.878
It's called
a 2-seam fastball.

36:28.953 --> 36:31.752
Now, don't throw that until your
arm is good and warm, Celia.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.086
Don't be a hero.

36:33.158 --> 36:34.387
I don't believe this.

36:34.459 --> 36:35.824
Hey, Rebecca's back.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.328
Who wants to show Rebecca
what we've been working on?

36:37.395 --> 36:40.524
This is my office.
This is so totally my office.

36:40.598 --> 36:44.091
You guys, I think Rebecca
wants you to leave.

36:44.169 --> 36:45.398
This is <i>my</i> office.

36:45.470 --> 36:46.494
That's my desk.

36:46.571 --> 36:47.732
This is my chair.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.137
This is my job.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.402
You look to me like somebody

36:50.475 --> 36:52.409
who needs to learn the proper
grip of a 2-seam fastball.

36:52.477 --> 36:54.411
Dan, you see
that I have work to do?

36:54.479 --> 36:57.107
I see you have work to do, but I'm not
entirely convinced you know what it is.

36:57.182 --> 37:00.516
-- Get out. -- You really won't
watch a baseball game with me, huh?

37:00.585 --> 37:01.575
Not tonight.

37:01.653 --> 37:02.745
Really?

37:02.821 --> 37:04.550
Yeah.

37:07.092 --> 37:10.323
All right.

37:10.395 --> 37:12.227
I'm not discouraged.

37:12.297 --> 37:13.196
Good.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.765
I am Dan.

37:16.835 --> 37:17.859
Yes, you are.

37:20.105 --> 37:23.370
See you Monday.

37:25.009 --> 37:27.239
Yeah.

37:27.312 --> 37:29.804
<i>Listen to what Milton</i> says
<i>in Paradise Lost</i> --

37:29.881 --> 37:33.579
he's basically saying that Orion
becomes an instrument of divine wrath,

37:33.651 --> 37:36.780
perfectly controlled by God to
thwart those who would defy him,

37:36.855 --> 37:39.051
who "treadeth upon
the waves of the sea."

37:39.124 --> 37:41.218
<i>Casey, did you get
a 5-minute call?</i>

37:41.292 --> 37:43.090
-- Nope.
-- Five minutes.

37:43.161 --> 37:44.094
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

37:44.162 --> 37:45.220
-- It's 10 to 11:00.
-- Right.

37:45.296 --> 37:47.094
We still go on the air
at 11:00, right?

37:47.165 --> 37:48.098
-- Yes.
-- So...

37:48.166 --> 37:49.429
I want to talk to Jeremy.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.401
No problem.
Talk to me later, Jeremy.

37:51.469 --> 37:52.959
-- Thanks.
-- By the way...

37:53.037 --> 37:56.302
<i>this is the second time today
I've been kicked out of a room,</i>

37:56.374 --> 37:58.604
and I go pleasantly
and without incident.

37:58.676 --> 37:59.302
Thank you.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.175
There's a lot of
great stuff on Orion --

38:07.252 --> 38:09.949
the god and also
the constellation.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.750
You know, most people
see only the belt,

38:11.823 --> 38:14.190
which is formed by delta,
epsilon, and zeta --

38:14.259 --> 38:15.693
three second-magnitude stars

38:15.760 --> 38:18.161
that are spaced equally
in a straight line.

38:18.229 --> 38:20.664
Beneath the belt is a line
of fainter stars,

38:20.732 --> 38:23.633
and, of these stars, theta
isn't really a star at all.

38:23.701 --> 38:27.831
It's actually the brightest part
of the Orion nebula.

38:27.906 --> 38:32.104
So this great pink star
in the sword of Orion

38:32.177 --> 38:34.976
turns out to be something...

38:35.079 --> 38:38.344
far more complicated
and interesting.

38:46.391 --> 38:50.419
My father's been having an affair
with a woman for 27 years.

38:53.531 --> 38:55.124
Do you know her?

38:55.200 --> 38:58.636
No.

38:58.703 --> 39:00.671
How did your mom find out?

39:00.738 --> 39:03.708
He fold her.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.381
You know...

39:10.448 --> 39:14.009
I don't know how quickly
I can get this piece done.

39:14.085 --> 39:15.985
-- That's okay.
-- It's worth it, I think,

39:16.054 --> 39:19.149
to figure out...

39:19.224 --> 39:24.094
exactly how this boat
that was supposed to win...

39:25.830 --> 39:29.562
...met with this kind
of disaster.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.469
I'd like to look at a chart.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.870
-- <i>It's okay.</i>
-- I'm sorry I didn't call.

39:35.940 --> 39:39.308
Don't think about that now.

40:06.671 --> 40:09.663
with the final-round coverage of
the Battle Creek Invitational.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.937
We'll see if Fuzzy Zoeller
can close the gap.

Yes. VVould you tell graphics that
the wise thing for them to do

40:28.092 --> 40:30.390
would be to leave the building

didn't want me in that world.

to him, and I --

mixing those things.

excruciating,
