00:01.267 --> 00:03.326
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2010...</i>

00:03.436 --> 00:05.370
<i>our friends Stuart and Claudia</i>
<i>had a baby...</i>

00:05.471 --> 00:08.839
<i>and Lily and Marshall were the first</i>
<i>to visit the happy new parents.</i>

00:08.942 --> 00:10.671
So, have you guys landed on a name yet?

00:10.777 --> 00:12.438
We're tryin', but it's tougher than you think.

00:12.545 --> 00:14.012
See, I like Tiffany.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.514
And I don't want my daughter
to have a whore's name.

00:16.616 --> 00:18.345
- That's my mother's name.
- I know.

00:18.451 --> 00:19.918
Oh, I got it!

00:20.020 --> 00:22.853
How about we name the baby after you...
Frigid Shrew.

00:22.956 --> 00:25.083
Oh! That's good. No, no, no.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.681
Let's call her Vodka.

00:26.793 --> 00:29.227
Then at least we know you'll hold her
tight and never let her go.

00:29.329 --> 00:31.627
Don't knock the vodka.
Wouldn't have a kid without it.

00:31.731 --> 00:34.962
Oh, that's, Stuart... You are so...

00:35.068 --> 00:36.535
That's not gonna be us, right?

00:36.636 --> 00:39.070
I mean, how hard can it be to name a baby?

00:39.172 --> 00:42.335
Right? Just look at her.
She's clearly a...

00:42.442 --> 00:43.909
- Lisa.
- Emily.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.238
- Emily?
- Lisa?

00:45.345 --> 00:50.078
Uh-oh.

01:03.196 --> 01:05.858
Okay! I made a list of awesome baby names.

01:05.965 --> 01:08.058
Starting at the top, number one...

01:08.168 --> 01:10.398
I'm gonna stop you right there, Marshall.

01:10.503 --> 01:12.403
You name a chubby white kid LeBron...

01:12.505 --> 01:14.905
and he's the one getting stuffed
in the basketball hoop.

01:15.008 --> 01:18.409
- Then I'm also crossing off, um, Shaquille...
- Mm-hmm.

01:18.511 --> 01:21.571
Hakeem and Dikembe.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.072
Wait. What about Rob?

01:24.184 --> 01:26.744
- Rob? No.
- Why not?

01:26.853 --> 01:29.344
Hey, Rob. What are you
gonna make... a turkey?

01:29.456 --> 01:32.152
Hunka, hunka!

01:34.194 --> 01:36.059
Not Rob.

01:36.162 --> 01:39.359
Um, how about Ryan?

01:43.803 --> 01:45.964
Not Ryan.

01:46.072 --> 01:47.334
Johnny?

01:47.440 --> 01:50.432
Hey, where's the goldfish?

01:54.981 --> 01:56.471
Not Johnny.

01:58.351 --> 01:59.818
Or Gil.

02:02.222 --> 02:03.689
Jeremy.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.293
Jeremy, no!

02:12.265 --> 02:14.199
Definitely not Jeremy.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.461
His stuff was so derivative.

02:16.569 --> 02:18.628
Well, I mean... Geez, Lily.

02:18.738 --> 02:21.969
Well, whatever you do, do not
name your baby Becky. Right?

02:22.075 --> 02:23.474
Why? What...

02:23.576 --> 02:26.238
Becky. My new co-anchor.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.712
Wait, don't you guys ever watch the show?

02:28.815 --> 02:30.248
We really try.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.045
Our DVR won't recognize it
as a television program.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.382
I watched.

02:34.487 --> 02:37.251
- Robin insisted I confirm how "awful" Becky is...
- Mm-hmm.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.848
so last night I checked it out.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.392
Peace talks in the region...

02:41.494 --> 02:43.428
have been described as productive.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.397
- Becky.
- Last night in Staten Island...

02:46.499 --> 02:49.935
a taco cart owner was robbed at gunpoint.

02:50.036 --> 02:52.698
Oh! That's so sad.

02:52.805 --> 02:54.466
Becky, we're... we're journalists.

02:54.574 --> 02:57.202
- We can't get emotional about the news we...
- Oh, no!

02:57.310 --> 03:00.404
They stole all his money and then
pelted him with his own taco meat!

03:00.513 --> 03:02.344
Who would do that?

03:02.448 --> 03:04.712
Well, if you read this story,
we might find out.

03:05.752 --> 03:08.949
Oh. Can I do this one about the horse?

03:09.055 --> 03:11.888
- I love horsies.
- Mm-hmm.

03:11.991 --> 03:14.721
Oh! The horse died.

03:14.827 --> 03:19.230
Guys, this news is all really sad.

03:19.332 --> 03:23.666
Okay, no holds barred.
What'd you think of Becky?

03:23.770 --> 03:25.795
Mmm.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.634
- I thought she was charming.
- You too?

03:30.743 --> 03:34.372
Can somebody please explain to me
why the "little girl" act works on men?

03:34.480 --> 03:35.879
Want the long version
or the short version?

03:35.982 --> 03:37.381
Short version.

03:37.483 --> 03:39.178
Short version...

03:39.285 --> 03:41.219
Who's your daddy?

03:41.321 --> 03:42.913
You know, when you think about that...

03:43.022 --> 03:45.047
that phrase is really creepy.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.991
No, it's not. It's fun. Here, watch this.

03:48.094 --> 03:49.584
Hey, Lily...

03:50.530 --> 03:52.327
who's your daddy?

03:52.432 --> 03:53.899
Okay, uh, let me get this straight.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.163
So in this scenario,
because you make such sweet love to Lily...

03:57.270 --> 03:58.897
she is now your daughter?

03:59.005 --> 04:00.734
No, she is not my daughter.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.434
I'm just... her daddy.

04:03.543 --> 04:06.774
- Wow, that is disgusting.
- Exactly. It's not like the opposite will work.

04:06.879 --> 04:10.007
There's no way a guy could pick up a girl
going around talking like a little boy.

04:10.116 --> 04:11.606
- Challenge accepted.
- No.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.583
I, Barney Stinson...

04:13.686 --> 04:16.849
will pick up a girl
whilst talking like a little boy.

04:16.956 --> 04:19.220
It'll never work.

04:19.325 --> 04:21.850
- Okay, here's my list of baby names.
- Oh.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.293
- What about Tara?
- No.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.922
Not Tara. Tara was the hottest girl
in my high school.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.194
We were all, like, obsessed with her.

04:29.302 --> 04:32.669
<i>We didn't just talk about her</i>
<i>and fantasize about her.</i>

04:32.772 --> 04:34.535
<i>We wrote songs about her.</i>

04:34.641 --> 04:40.273
# Tara, your booty is so smooth #

04:40.380 --> 04:44.976
# And I hope this isn't rude #

04:45.084 --> 04:47.644
# But I wanna get up on it ##

04:49.789 --> 04:51.586
Not Tara.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.591
What about Esther?

04:56.095 --> 04:57.562
<i>Gentlemen, gentlemen.</i>

04:57.664 --> 05:00.724
<i>On the main stage, give it up for Estherl</i>

05:00.833 --> 05:02.130
Oh, oh.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.465
Hey, Barney, that prime rib
was surprisingly good...

05:04.570 --> 05:06.231
but it's 10:30 in the morning.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.534
I don't need to see a lady
get naked and dance.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.075
Oh, Esther gets naked,
but she doesn't dance.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.737
Then what does she do?

05:19.819 --> 05:21.878
Sweet Mother Nature!

05:26.959 --> 05:29.223
That <i>was</i> my card.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.423
<i>Gentlemen, gentlemen.</i>
<i>Give it up for Estherl</i>

05:36.669 --> 05:38.034
Not Esther.

05:39.105 --> 05:41.369
I need a drink. Ted? Hmm? Ted?

05:45.445 --> 05:47.913
Marshall, your list is entirely boy names.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.074
You do realize there's roughly a 50%
chance of you having a daughter, right?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.516
Okay, honestly,
I've never thought about having a girl.

05:53.619 --> 05:55.678
I don't want to think about having a girl.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.278
Tara, Esther...

05:57.390 --> 05:59.517
can you imagine being one
of those girls' dads?

05:59.625 --> 06:02.822
# Marshall's daughter #

06:02.929 --> 06:08.094
# Your booty
Your booty's so smooth ##

06:08.201 --> 06:09.668
<i>Gentlemen, gentlemen.</i>

06:09.769 --> 06:13.227
<i>On the main stage,</i>
<i>give it up for Marshall's daughter.</i>

06:15.641 --> 06:17.506
He screwed up my childhood.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.942
That's why I do this.

06:22.849 --> 06:25.374
I have no idea how to raise a daughter.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.009
What if she makes bad choices?

06:27.120 --> 06:29.088
I mean, what if she ends up dating some...

06:30.890 --> 06:32.152
Oh, God.

06:32.258 --> 06:34.317
Papa, I want you to meet my new boyfriend.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.597
Hey, bro.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.564
Thanks for makin' such a hottie.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.465
Who's your daddy?

06:44.570 --> 06:47.004
You are... 'cause of all the sex we have!

06:51.844 --> 06:54.312
I don't want a girl.
I just want a little boy.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.572
It's not what it sounds like, folks.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.851
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

07:04.957 --> 07:07.551
<i>Marshall, is that you?</i>

07:07.660 --> 07:10.128
Oh, okay, you guys,
you're a little too close to the camera.

07:10.229 --> 07:11.696
Can you back up a bit?

07:14.333 --> 07:15.800
<i>How's this?</i>

07:15.902 --> 07:17.529
Every time.

07:17.637 --> 07:22.700
Um, can you just sit in front of the
computer like normal human beings?

07:22.809 --> 07:24.299
Perfect. Perfect.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.173
<i>What's up, Shooter?</i>

07:26.279 --> 07:28.008
To be honest, I'm getting
a little freaked out...

07:28.114 --> 07:30.082
about the idea of having a daughter.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.743
I know you two probably aren't the right
people to talk to about this.

07:32.852 --> 07:35.685
- You had all boys.
- <i>Oh, well, that... that was just dumb luck.</i>

07:35.788 --> 07:39.189
<i>Uh, hey, honey, would you get me</i>
<i>a brewski from outta the shed?</i>

07:39.292 --> 07:41.192
<i>Sure. You want anything, Marshall?</i>

07:41.294 --> 07:42.784
I'm in a computer, Mom.

07:42.895 --> 07:44.886
<i>Oh.</i>

07:44.997 --> 07:46.464
<i>Yeah, all boys.</i>

07:46.566 --> 07:49.091
<i>Total coinkydink.</i>

07:49.202 --> 07:51.102
<i>It was no coinkydink.</i>

07:51.204 --> 07:52.865
<i>Since the Viking age...</i>

07:52.972 --> 07:56.999
<i>the Eriksen men have passed down</i>
<i>ancient secrets for conceiving boys.</i>

07:57.109 --> 07:59.600
<i>Avoid lemons.</i>

07:59.712 --> 08:01.646
<i>They're baby girl fertilizer.</i>

08:01.747 --> 08:03.374
Okay, no offense, Dad...

08:03.483 --> 08:05.314
but I doubt there's
any scientific data to support...

08:05.418 --> 08:08.444
<i>"I doubt there's any</i>
<i>scientific data to support"...</i>

08:08.554 --> 08:10.249
<i>I had all sonsl</i>

08:10.356 --> 08:12.221
<i>Your grandfather had all sons.</i>

08:12.325 --> 08:14.816
<i>Your great-grandfather had all sons.</i>

08:14.927 --> 08:16.417
<i>Scoreboardl</i>

08:16.529 --> 08:20.488
<i>Who you gonna listen to...</i>
<i>me or the scientific data?</i>

08:22.635 --> 08:25.263
Members of the G-8
convened today in Vienna...

08:25.371 --> 08:28.568
to discuss plans to fight climate change,
by which...

08:28.674 --> 08:31.268
- What?
- Ask me what I did yesterday.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.708
Hey, Becky.
Becky, this is our news segment, okay?

08:33.813 --> 08:35.405
Nobody cares what you did yesterday.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.746
Lighten up, Robin.
What'd you do, sweetheart?

08:38.851 --> 08:40.148
Mike?

08:40.253 --> 08:43.813
Well, I'm new in town
and don't know many people...

08:43.923 --> 08:46.551
but yesterday I met the sweetest man...

08:46.659 --> 08:49.355
who took me on a tour of the city.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.987
Guys, New York is kinda cool.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.328
Okay. Back to the G-8 conference.

08:54.433 --> 08:55.730
Hello?

08:55.835 --> 08:58.269
Mike? Can I get in the shot?

08:58.371 --> 09:01.169
Fantastic.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.367
Then, this cutie patootie...

09:03.476 --> 09:06.309
took me to this bar called MacLaren's
right underneath his apartment.

09:06.412 --> 09:10.280
- Wait. Did you go out with Ted Mosby?
- Yes!

09:10.383 --> 09:12.647
Guys, I went out with Robin's roommate.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.243
I saw her bedroom.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.982
She's a messy Bessie.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.557
In other news...

09:19.659 --> 09:23.595
later today a Manhattan architect
gets punched in the throat.

09:23.696 --> 09:25.163
Ow!

09:25.264 --> 09:26.891
Ted, of all the women in New York...

09:26.999 --> 09:29.229
you had to go out
with an eight-year-old girl?

09:29.335 --> 09:31.132
Yeah. Not what it sounds like, folks.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.535
Ted, you know that I hate her.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.766
How could you go out
on a date with this girl?

09:35.875 --> 09:37.342
It wasn't a date.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.502
She came over to the apartment
looking for you.

09:39.612 --> 09:43.070
I made Robin my famous
chocolate-chip cookies...

09:43.182 --> 09:46.743
but instead of chocolate chips
I used Gummi bears.

09:46.852 --> 09:47.910
Oh!

09:48.020 --> 09:50.079
A spider!

09:51.457 --> 09:52.924
Let me guess.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.050
She acted like a helpless little girl...

09:55.161 --> 09:57.425
and you stepped in as the big strong man.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.192
I don't know if that's totally true.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.965
It's okay, little darlin'.

10:06.072 --> 10:07.596
Poor spider.

10:07.707 --> 10:09.436
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.344
Spiders gotta die...

10:13.446 --> 10:15.437
so trees can grow.

10:17.216 --> 10:19.275
Then I held her tight...

10:19.385 --> 10:22.115
told her it was all gonna be okay.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.356
By the way, I think
I only wounded the spider.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.050
It crawled off into my bedroom.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.127
Wait. Is that why
you slept on the couch last night?

10:29.228 --> 10:31.890
Yeah. I slept.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.028
I'm dyin' out here.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.626
Talkin' like a little boy
is not working with the ladies.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.899
Wow, lady.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.407
You got some "tig ol' bitties"!

10:46.379 --> 10:47.846
Gosh!

10:47.947 --> 10:52.077
Your body's a perfect... this many.

10:54.053 --> 10:57.545
Uh, do you wanna wrestle
with our special bathing suit places?

10:58.791 --> 11:00.258
Come on.

11:01.193 --> 11:02.820
I just need two seconds, baby.

11:02.928 --> 11:04.793
I know you think that's a compliment...

11:04.897 --> 11:06.922
but I'd rather you take your time.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.365
No, um, I'll be... I'll be right back.

11:17.443 --> 11:21.379
<i>Ancient Norse wisdom tells us</i>
<i>that to sire a son...</i>

11:21.480 --> 11:24.813
<i>you must do three things</i>
<i>right before you lay with your maiden.</i>

11:24.917 --> 11:27.511
<i>First, eat pickled herring.</i>

11:28.888 --> 11:30.685
<i>Eat itl</i>

11:30.790 --> 11:33.190
This is ridiculous.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.159
<i>Gentlemen, gentlemen.</i>

11:38.264 --> 11:40.232
<i>On the main stage,</i>
<i>throwing her life away...</i>

11:40.332 --> 11:42.766
<i>give it up for Marshall's daughter.</i>

11:46.572 --> 11:48.972
Who's your granddaddy?

11:50.042 --> 11:52.374
That guy.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.887
Hey, wanna have a three-way
with me and my imaginary friend?

12:04.990 --> 12:06.821
His name's Otis.

12:06.926 --> 12:09.486
You don't...

12:09.595 --> 12:12.257
Hey. Hey! Wanna come
to my house and play telephone?

12:12.364 --> 12:14.559
I got the string, you got the cans.

12:17.937 --> 12:20.167
I wet myself. Will you change me?

12:21.540 --> 12:23.337
Can't blame her on that one.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.241
Guys, I have some terrible, terrible news.

12:29.348 --> 12:32.317
I, Barney Stinson...

12:32.418 --> 12:36.650
can't pick up a girl
whilst talking like a little boy.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.281
Challenge forfeited.

12:39.391 --> 12:42.827
- We don't care about this at all.
- No one challenged you.
It wasn't really a challenge.

12:44.396 --> 12:46.091
I'm sorry.

12:47.299 --> 12:48.926
Hey, Gerard. What's with that shirt?

12:49.034 --> 12:51.093
Nobody could pick up a chick
wearing that thing.

12:51.203 --> 12:53.228
Challenge accept...

12:56.876 --> 12:58.400
Wow, I'm glad that's over.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.979
It was creepy watching Barney
talk like a little kid.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.275
Oh, but you find it irresistible
when Becky does?

13:03.382 --> 13:05.612
I don't get it.
The Ted that I went out with...

13:05.718 --> 13:07.310
was attracted to the kind of woman...

13:07.419 --> 13:09.614
who could use a steak knife
without supervision.

13:09.722 --> 13:12.247
For your information,
Becky doesn't like steak.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.553
She likes "pasghetti"... Spaghetti.

13:14.660 --> 13:18.096
- And more importantly,
she makes me feel needed.
- Needed?

13:18.197 --> 13:20.324
She makes training wheels feel needed.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.229
Hey, it's nice to feel needed.

13:22.334 --> 13:25.064
And you know what? It's not a feeling
guys get when they're with you.

13:31.177 --> 13:34.112
<i>Son, Viking lore tells us...</i>

13:34.213 --> 13:38.149
<i>that to ensure the continuation</i>
<i>of your noble male lineage...</i>

13:39.885 --> 13:43.184
<i>get a big ol'bowl of ice</i>
<i>and dunk your man sack right in there.</i>

13:43.289 --> 13:45.849
<i>You two and your football.</i>

13:52.698 --> 13:54.165
Okay.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.469
Mm-hmm.

14:04.210 --> 14:07.304
<i>Now, get in there, point Lily due north...</i>

14:07.413 --> 14:09.677
<i>and make me a grandsonl</i>

14:09.782 --> 14:12.182
<i>Eriksenl</i>

14:12.284 --> 14:15.515
Eriksen!

14:23.128 --> 14:24.720
When we were dating, l...

14:24.830 --> 14:26.457
I didn't make you feel needed?

14:26.565 --> 14:29.534
Come on. You always
took charge of everything.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.533
Oop. I got this.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.568
Is this okay? Am I hurting you?

14:37.676 --> 14:39.541
- I got this.
- Whoa!

14:41.347 --> 14:44.407
Someone's trying to break in!
Call the cops.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.677
I got this.

14:48.654 --> 14:50.884
- Did that really bother you?
- Well, yeah.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.254
It's nice to be needed.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.350
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.828
It's Becky.
Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.760
I got this.

15:05.871 --> 15:06.929
Thank you.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.241
- Let's make a baby.
- Mmm!

15:13.012 --> 15:13.910
Whoa!

15:14.013 --> 15:16.277
Baby, you're packin' snowballs...

15:16.382 --> 15:18.577
and your breath
smells like a mermaid fart.

15:19.818 --> 15:21.979
Loving the dirty talk.
You know what's even hotter?

15:22.087 --> 15:23.884
- If we face this-a way.
- Hmm?

15:23.989 --> 15:25.786
- Ooh, we're bad.
- Baby...

15:25.891 --> 15:28.291
Hey, baby, why are you facing me north?

15:28.394 --> 15:30.123
l...

15:30.229 --> 15:32.129
You're trying to make us have a boy!

15:32.231 --> 15:34.131
I can ex...

15:35.734 --> 15:37.361
How do you know about the north thing?

15:37.469 --> 15:38.936
Oh, um...

15:39.038 --> 15:41.336
And what are you doing with those lemons?

15:42.908 --> 15:45.035
<i>Baby girl fertilizerl</i>

15:46.045 --> 15:48.138
You're trying to make us have a girl!

15:53.118 --> 15:55.177
You <i>are</i> trying to make us have a girl.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.654
All my least favorite students
have been boys...

15:58.757 --> 16:01.624
so I googled "How to make a girl."

16:01.727 --> 16:04.355
Some really weird stuff came up.

16:04.463 --> 16:08.490
But, finally, I found this conception
Web site that said you should...

16:08.600 --> 16:11.626
<i>Point south at the moment of conception...</i>

16:11.737 --> 16:14.205
<i>eat a lemon...</i>

16:16.942 --> 16:20.673
<i>and heat up your lady parts</i>
<i>to a balmy 105 degrees.</i>

16:24.616 --> 16:29.019
Ooh. Ahhh. Oh, that's not bad.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.021
Mmm!

16:31.123 --> 16:32.556
Eriksen!

16:32.658 --> 16:34.125
Ooh, ooh.

16:35.527 --> 16:37.757
Lily, how could you do...

16:37.863 --> 16:39.592
exactly the same thing I did?

16:39.698 --> 16:41.325
You're supposed to be the sane one.

16:41.433 --> 16:45.369
See that? Another boy expecting a woman
to clean up his mistakes.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.496
That's why girls are way better than boys.

16:47.606 --> 16:50.404
Oh, really? Then how come whenever
there's a creepy kid in a horror movie...

16:50.509 --> 16:55.208
it's always a little girl...
or twin girls who speak in unison.

16:55.314 --> 16:57.043
Oh, well, what about <i>Chucky?</i>

16:57.149 --> 16:59.640
Okay. A: He was a doll.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.482
He was possessed
by an adult serial killer.

17:02.588 --> 17:06.422
How could you
bring up <i>Chucky</i> right before bed?

17:10.963 --> 17:12.021
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:12.131 --> 17:13.655
Hey. Um...

17:13.766 --> 17:17.133
When we were dating, did...
did I make you feel needed?

17:17.236 --> 17:20.137
No, I didn't feel
like you needed me at all.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.934
That's what I thought.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.770
Uh, I'm sorry.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.242
Wait. Where are you go...
That's a compliment.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.507
You're the least-needy woman
I've ever met.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.082
That's awesome.

17:31.183 --> 17:34.880
I mean, no guy's gonna say
"Who's your daddy?" to Robin Scherbatsky.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.682
You're your own daddy...

17:36.789 --> 17:38.279
and mommy...

17:38.390 --> 17:41.257
and weird survivalist uncle
who lives in a cabin with a shotgun...

17:41.360 --> 17:42.987
blaming stuff on the government.

17:45.764 --> 17:49.825
And that is what makes you
the most amazing...

17:49.935 --> 17:52.028
strong...

17:52.137 --> 17:55.004
independent woman I've ever banged.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.337
Thanks, Barney.

17:57.443 --> 18:01.345
You know, um, there's something
that I wanted to ask you.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.275
I don't really know how to say it...

18:04.383 --> 18:05.907
so here goes.

18:07.453 --> 18:10.013
Who's the crazy chick in the apron?

18:10.122 --> 18:13.523
Someone naughty left
his toys on the floor...

18:13.625 --> 18:17.117
and needs to be spanked on his tushy-tush.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.425
Uh-oh. I'm in twubble!

18:22.534 --> 18:24.525
You did it. How?

18:24.636 --> 18:28.629
Last night after admitting defeat,
I just let myself go.

18:28.740 --> 18:31.607
Mmm! That looks so good. Can I have some?

18:31.710 --> 18:35.703
No! It's my ice cream. You can't have any.

18:35.814 --> 18:38.977
Someone needs to teach you how to share.

18:42.254 --> 18:44.620
Who's your mommy?

18:48.827 --> 18:50.658
Challenge completed!

18:50.762 --> 18:52.229
Mmm.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.799
Now, uh, can you get
this freak outta here? I'm really scared.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.663
I got this.

19:03.008 --> 19:05.533
Oh, so you finally agreed on a name.

19:05.644 --> 19:10.513
Well, the other night,
she ran a... a really high fever.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.210
<i>We rushed her to the emergency</i>
<i>room at 3:00 in the morning...</i>

19:13.318 --> 19:15.718
<i>but they wouldn't admit her</i>
<i>without a name.</i>

19:18.157 --> 19:22.491
Right then and there
we realized how stupid we were being.

19:22.594 --> 19:26.997
We looked at each other
and, well, we just knew.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.691
Our baby's name is...

19:28.800 --> 19:30.267
Esther.

19:30.369 --> 19:31.996
Esther!

19:32.971 --> 19:34.700
Esther!

19:34.806 --> 19:36.433
That's beautiful.

19:36.542 --> 19:37.736
Yeah.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.040
We're idiots.

19:42.147 --> 19:45.776
Baby, names and gender... It's just like...

19:45.884 --> 19:47.852
It's some way of giving ourselves
the illusion...

19:47.953 --> 19:49.818
that we have any control whatsoever.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.686
l-I just want a healthy, happy 12-pound...

19:52.791 --> 19:54.418
Whoa!

19:54.526 --> 19:55.891
Ten-pound?

19:56.962 --> 19:59.362
- Eight-pound?
- I guess.

19:59.464 --> 20:01.989
But, dude, you're writing checks
my vagina can't cash.

20:04.403 --> 20:05.870
- I love you.
- Mmm.

20:05.971 --> 20:08.940
And I'm gonna love the crap
outta whatever baby we have.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.032
Me too.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.371
You know what?

20:17.482 --> 20:20.747
We should just think of a name that's good
for either a girl or a boy.

20:20.852 --> 20:24.083
- Like, um...
- Jamie.

20:24.189 --> 20:27.920
Marshall, we just named our baby.

20:29.094 --> 20:30.220
Jamie.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.298
Not Jamie!

20:46.511 --> 20:48.479
Shoe's untied. I got it.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.687
Yeah, this is over.
