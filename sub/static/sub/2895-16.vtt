it's not gonna be
the same conversation.

09:02.323 --> 09:05.625
Thanks for the drink.
Good luck, Mr. Forstman.

09:09.797 --> 09:11.581
Okay.

09:11.666 --> 09:12.666
What are you doing?

09:12.667 --> 09:14.084
What do you think I'm doing?

09:14.218 --> 09:16.336
If Forstman gave the money
to someone Woodall's close to,

09:16.420 --> 09:18.638
we need to start
by compiling a family tree.

09:18.756 --> 09:21.391
I meant why aren't you
at school today?

09:21.509 --> 09:25.011
Because I'm gonna prove
to Harvey that I exist.

09:25.146 --> 09:26.263
Okay.

09:26.347 --> 09:27.981
Now that you mention it,
what was that last night?

09:28.099 --> 09:29.349
Ever since you came back,

09:29.433 --> 09:31.685
it's like you and Harvey
speak this secret language,

09:31.819 --> 09:32.686
and I'm not a part of it.

09:32.770 --> 09:34.237
Rachel, come on.
We have history.

09:34.355 --> 09:36.595
I'm not talking about history.
I'm talking about respect.

09:36.607 --> 09:37.858
Okay, you don't know
what you're talking about

09:37.942 --> 09:39.192
if you think
Harvey doesn't respect you.

09:39.327 --> 09:40.327
Are you gonna tell me
that last night

09:40.444 --> 09:41.578
he didn't give you a look
that said,

09:41.696 --> 09:43.163
"You don't need to tell her
the full story

09:43.281 --> 09:44.601
because she doesn't need
to know"?

09:44.665 --> 09:46.025
Rachel, he didn't give me
that look

09:46.083 --> 09:47.200
because he doesn't respect you.

09:47.285 --> 09:51.004
He gave me that look
because he's ashamed.

09:51.122 --> 09:52.455
What are you talking about?

09:55.376 --> 09:56.793
Let's just say that
I'm not the only one

09:56.928 --> 09:58.128
that Charles Forstman duped.

09:58.212 --> 10:00.597
- Harvey got taken by Forstman?
- Yes.

10:00.681 --> 10:01.965
And he only told me
because he had to

10:02.099 --> 10:04.099
when we were in the middle
of that takeover battle.

10:04.135 --> 10:07.637
That's why Harvey's so slow
to care about anybody.

10:07.805 --> 10:10.557
Forstman used somebody
he cared about.

10:10.641 --> 10:12.776
Holy shit.
I never even thought about that.

10:12.860 --> 10:13.977
Who do you think it was?

10:14.061 --> 10:17.147
I don't know,
but I have a pretty good guess.

10:17.281 --> 10:19.649
Well, what do you think?

10:19.784 --> 10:21.785
I think this place is a dump,
and I'm busy,

10:21.869 --> 10:24.120
so why don't you tell me
why we're here?

10:24.205 --> 10:25.485
I want to open
a restaurant here.

10:25.573 --> 10:27.324
Marcus, there's already
a restaurant here.

10:27.491 --> 10:28.909
And it isn't working.

10:28.993 --> 10:31.578
Which is why they're gonna
lose their lease.

10:31.662 --> 10:33.046
Take a look.

10:33.164 --> 10:35.215
I've got a chef.

10:35.333 --> 10:36.666
I've got a liquor license.

10:36.751 --> 10:38.168
I've got renovation plans.

10:38.302 --> 10:40.971
I have everything I need.

10:41.088 --> 10:43.173
Except the money.

10:43.307 --> 10:44.591
I need $150,000.

10:44.675 --> 10:46.259
- Are you crazy?
- Come on, Harvey.

10:46.344 --> 10:47.561
This is my dream.

10:47.678 --> 10:48.895
I know I can make this work.

10:49.013 --> 10:50.013
And I'm not saying you can't,

10:50.097 --> 10:51.014
but I don't have
that kind of money.

10:51.148 --> 10:53.183
What are you talking about?

10:53.267 --> 10:55.569
You're the big-time lawyer who
just got his name in the paper.

10:55.686 --> 10:58.355
My name in the paper
doesn't pay me extra money.

10:58.489 --> 11:00.323
I make $50,000 a year.

11:00.408 --> 11:02.242
And you said you were gonna be
a corporate lawyer.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.400
Yeah, and when I am,
I can help you, but right now--

11:04.445 --> 11:06.746
I don't give a shit
about right now.

11:06.864 --> 11:08.531
I give a shit about when
you were supposed to be

11:08.666 --> 11:09.866
my big brother, but instead,
what did you do?

11:10.034 --> 11:11.034
I know what I did.

11:11.118 --> 11:12.702
Then you know
I can never get a loan

11:12.787 --> 11:14.120
for as long as I live.

11:14.255 --> 11:15.422
Marcus, when are you gonna
take responsibility

11:15.539 --> 11:16.673
for your own shit?

11:16.757 --> 11:18.677
What the hell does it look like
I'm trying to do?

11:23.681 --> 11:27.550
I came to you first because
I know you'd want me to,

11:27.635 --> 11:30.353
but if you don't come through,

11:30.438 --> 11:31.855
I'm gonna go to Mom.

11:31.973 --> 11:33.139
You don't mean Mom.

11:33.274 --> 11:34.557
You mean him.

11:34.692 --> 11:36.476
And you're not taking
a nickel from that man.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.111
Taking his money
isn't gonna make

11:38.229 --> 11:39.729
what he did to Dad any worse.

11:39.864 --> 11:41.564
That's bullshit,
and you know it,

11:41.732 --> 11:43.700
and I'm not gonna
let you do it.

11:43.818 --> 11:45.402
Hey, Harvey.

11:45.486 --> 11:47.487
How the hell
are you gonna stop me?

11:54.795 --> 11:55.795
Am I crazy,

11:55.913 --> 11:57.414
or is that the same dress
you were wearing

11:57.498 --> 11:59.082
the last time I saw you?

11:59.216 --> 12:00.216
You must be crazy,

12:00.251 --> 12:01.885
because I don't wear
the same dress ever.

12:01.969 --> 12:04.587
Then you must spend a fortune
on wardrobe.

12:04.672 --> 12:08.091
But I have to say,
it's worth it.

12:08.225 --> 12:10.927
I suddenly get the feeling
this isn't just a drop-by.

12:11.012 --> 12:12.762
I want to move up
our timeline.

12:12.930 --> 12:14.564
Harvey, we have a deal.

12:14.649 --> 12:15.929
I put myself on the line
for you,

12:15.983 --> 12:18.435
and our deal
is not going to change.

12:18.569 --> 12:20.103
I could just pay you
the money back and move on.

12:20.271 --> 12:22.188
And if you could do that,
you wouldn't be here

12:22.273 --> 12:23.406
asking to come back.

12:23.524 --> 12:25.692
How much money
did Marcus lose this time?

12:25.776 --> 12:27.976
He didn't lose anything.
He wants to start a restaurant.

12:28.029 --> 12:30.163
He doesn't want
to start shit.

12:30.281 --> 12:31.448
He owes somebody something.

12:31.582 --> 12:33.616
You don't know that.
He's turned his life around.

12:33.784 --> 12:35.702
What I know is,
he has a problem,

12:35.786 --> 12:38.838
and he's looking
to get money from you.

12:38.956 --> 12:41.591
And you're not gonna get it
from me.

12:41.676 --> 12:44.961
Then I'll get it
somewhere else.

12:45.096 --> 12:46.763
And what's that
supposed to mean?

12:46.847 --> 12:50.383
I got a job offer
from Charles Forstman.

12:50.518 --> 12:52.602
Look at me.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.304
I don't care
what he's offering you.

12:54.472 --> 12:55.305
Don't take it.

12:55.439 --> 12:56.940
Because he's got
a bad reputation?

12:57.024 --> 12:57.974
You think I don't know that?

12:58.142 --> 12:59.225
I think there are
a lot of things

12:59.360 --> 13:00.360
you think you know
that you don't.

13:00.478 --> 13:02.028
What I know is,
you're either gonna help me

13:02.146 --> 13:03.480
or Charles Forstman is.

13:03.614 --> 13:05.615
It's up to you.

13:05.700 --> 13:08.234
Harvey, I can't make you
listen to me,

13:08.319 --> 13:10.904
but what I'm not going to do
is let you come here

13:11.038 --> 13:12.598
and leverage me
with some bullshit offer

13:12.656 --> 13:15.458
from a shady banker,
so do what you're gonna do.

13:15.576 --> 13:17.711
But don't say
I didn't warn you.

13:31.553 --> 13:33.721
You can buy all the Wonder Bread
you want, Eric,

13:33.855 --> 13:35.272
but you can't take it with you
to prison.

13:35.390 --> 13:36.690
What are you doing here?

13:36.808 --> 13:39.109
I'm here to remind you
that once they find the money,

13:39.227 --> 13:40.978
it's all gonna come
tumbling down.

13:41.062 --> 13:42.582
Well, they're not gonna
find the money,

13:42.647 --> 13:44.732
'cause there is no money.

13:44.866 --> 13:48.285
Not in your accounts,
but I know what Cahill doesn't.

13:48.403 --> 13:50.237
Forstman gave it to somebody
you care about,

13:50.322 --> 13:51.789
and if I tell him that,
it'll be too late.

13:51.906 --> 13:53.240
I know what
you're trying to do.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.876
You're trying to bait me
into moving the body.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.128
We both know you're not
dumb enough to do that.

13:58.246 --> 13:59.663
I'm here to get you
to cut a deal

13:59.748 --> 14:00.914
and turn Forstman in.

14:00.999 --> 14:03.500
You don't have the authority
to cut a deal.

14:03.585 --> 14:06.587
No, but I can get Cahill to

14:06.721 --> 14:09.306
after you hire me
to represent you.

14:09.424 --> 14:12.643
You mean hire the fox
to watch the henhouse?

14:12.761 --> 14:13.761
Not a chance.

14:13.762 --> 14:16.313
Eric, they're closing in,

14:16.431 --> 14:18.932
and when they do,
you're gonna want to call me.

14:19.017 --> 14:21.585
So why don't you
take my card?

14:32.614 --> 14:34.498
This is ridiculous.

14:34.616 --> 14:36.016
Woodall's got 30 people
it could be,

14:36.034 --> 14:36.950
or it could be none of them.

14:37.035 --> 14:39.119
I know that,
but this is our job.

14:39.254 --> 14:43.173
No, our job is to help Harvey
get Forstman.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.211
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking--

14:45.276 --> 14:46.276
I am, and you are too.

14:46.277 --> 14:47.361
Rachel, we are never
gonna get Harvey

14:47.445 --> 14:49.485
to go after Forstman
for what they did 12 years ago.

14:49.497 --> 14:50.781
Why, because of his brother?

14:50.915 --> 14:53.434
Yes, because of his brother,
or because he's ashamed.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.202
Either way, he knows
it's a possibility.

14:55.286 --> 14:57.171
He doesn't need me
to tell him about it.

14:57.288 --> 14:59.757
No, he just doesn't need <i> me</i>
to tell him about it.

14:59.891 --> 15:01.792
- Rachel--
- This is not about that.

15:01.976 --> 15:04.178
Look, I can't tell him

15:04.295 --> 15:06.213
because I'm not supposed
to know, but you can.

15:06.297 --> 15:08.215
And I just told you,
he doesn't want to hear it.

15:08.350 --> 15:09.990
And when has that ever
stopped you before?

15:10.018 --> 15:11.268
- This is different.
- Why?

15:11.353 --> 15:14.388
Because he's ashamed.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.940
Then he's not
thinking right,

15:17.058 --> 15:19.977
and he needs your help
more than ever.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.897
Then we're both telling him.

15:24.032 --> 15:25.282
Mike, I don't need
the credit.

15:25.367 --> 15:27.735
No, this isn't about credit.
This is about us.

15:27.819 --> 15:30.487
He can't tell me something
and expect me not to tell you.

15:35.076 --> 15:36.076
You wanted to see me?

15:36.161 --> 15:37.544
Yes.
Where have you been all day?

15:37.662 --> 15:39.747
Why? Is there something
you want to talk about?

15:39.831 --> 15:40.831
Yeah, where you've been.

15:40.832 --> 15:42.416
Sean Cahill was at my door
last night--

15:42.550 --> 15:43.834
Harvey, Norma passed away.

15:43.918 --> 15:45.386
I've been helping Louis.

15:45.503 --> 15:47.504
Norma died?

15:47.589 --> 15:49.223
That's terrible.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.620
I thought
you couldn't stand her.

15:50.675 --> 15:54.144
I couldn't, but I assume
Louis loved her, so...

15:54.279 --> 15:55.562
- Do what you need to do.
- Oh.

15:55.697 --> 15:57.948
Because she was his secretary,
he must have loved her.

16:00.151 --> 16:02.503
- That's not what I meant.
- But it is what you said.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.238
Okay, Donna.
What's wrong?

16:04.372 --> 16:05.689
How about we start
with the fact

16:05.857 --> 16:08.041
that I have been wondering
for the last ten hours

16:08.176 --> 16:10.461
if you're going to acknowledge
what happened last night.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.179
But you're you,
so of course you're not.

16:12.247 --> 16:13.367
I'm not gonna acknowledge it

16:13.381 --> 16:14.798
because nothing happened
last night.

16:14.883 --> 16:16.967
Why?
And don't tell me I know why.

16:17.051 --> 16:19.171
Because it would have been
a mistake, and you know it.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.388
What I know is
something happened,

16:21.473 --> 16:23.891
and you ran away, but not before
you told me you loved me.

16:24.025 --> 16:27.811
I did that because I wanted
to make you feel better.

16:27.896 --> 16:29.446
What did you
just say to me?

16:29.564 --> 16:31.148
That's not what I meant.
I didn't say that--

16:31.232 --> 16:32.592
Because you pity me?
Yeah, you did.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.701
No, I said it
because I love you,

16:34.786 --> 16:35.702
and I wanted you to know it.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.070
Love me how?

16:37.205 --> 16:39.907
- Why does that have to--
- Love me how?

16:42.627 --> 16:44.244
That's what I thought.

16:44.412 --> 16:46.029
You either can't answer
or you won't,

16:46.164 --> 16:47.898
which is bullshit,
because obviously,

16:48.066 --> 16:49.249
you don't just look at me
this way.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.301
You're capable of looking at me
that way,

16:51.402 --> 16:53.202
but you don't want to let
those worlds collide

16:53.254 --> 16:54.774
because you're afraid
to risk anything.

16:54.806 --> 16:55.906
Because we have everything.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.724
No, Harvey.
<i>You</i> have everything.

16:57.809 --> 16:59.409
So you're saying
you want everything?

16:59.577 --> 17:01.311
I don't know, Harvey,

17:01.412 --> 17:05.132
but what I do know is
I don't want your pity.

17:08.269 --> 17:16.160
♪ ♪

17:20.531 --> 17:23.333
What are you doing here?
Nobody finds out where I live.

I do.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.794

Let me turn this off.

You're watching <i> Wall Street?</i>

what changed your mind?

17:45.507 --> 17:46.890
I decided
I wanted the money.

17:47.008 --> 17:48.308
And you turned me down,

17:48.443 --> 17:52.679
so now you're gonna tell me
why you want the money.

17:52.797 --> 17:55.399
My brother needs $150,000
for a restaurant.

17:55.483 --> 17:58.151
Hmm.
Now we're getting somewhere.

17:59.487 --> 18:00.621
Let's have it.

18:00.738 --> 18:02.239
Okay, you want it?

18:02.373 --> 18:05.409
Here it is.

18:05.543 --> 18:09.796
It's not just a restaurant.
It's a second chance.

18:09.914 --> 18:13.250
Marcus has
a gambling problem,

18:13.384 --> 18:14.468
and I gave it to him.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.153
Mm-hmm.

18:16.287 --> 18:18.322
And you think
this is his way out?

18:18.456 --> 18:19.323
I know it is.

18:19.407 --> 18:22.209
Hmm.

18:22.327 --> 18:23.994
We're not a good fit,

18:24.078 --> 18:25.796
'cause restaurants fail,

18:25.880 --> 18:28.465
and when this one does,
you'll leave.

18:28.550 --> 18:33.003
So you might as well leave
right now.

18:33.187 --> 18:34.267
Then how about
we bet on it?

18:34.322 --> 18:35.689
You're gonna gamble
on something

18:35.823 --> 18:37.841
to get your brother
out of a gambling problem?

18:37.926 --> 18:40.844
- I didn't say I had a problem.
- I think maybe you do.

18:40.979 --> 18:43.847
When you always win,
it's not a problem.

18:48.403 --> 18:49.603
I think
I might like you, pal.

18:57.695 --> 18:58.695
Louis.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.113
I got your message.
What's going on?

19:00.198 --> 19:01.748
What's going on is,
they're trying to screw me,

19:01.866 --> 19:02.749
and I need you to be bad cop.

19:02.867 --> 19:03.867
What?

19:03.868 --> 19:05.268
Have you made a decision, sir?

19:05.370 --> 19:08.455
No, I haven't made a decision,
you shyster dealer of death.

19:08.590 --> 19:10.674
Okay, I think maybe
we're gonna need another minute.

19:10.758 --> 19:11.959
No, we don't.

19:12.093 --> 19:13.413
I don't need another minute
to see

19:13.428 --> 19:14.962
that this looks like a pot
from Home Depot,

19:15.046 --> 19:16.446
this looks like a lamp
from Motel 6,

19:16.464 --> 19:18.849
and this looks like
a goddamn howitzer shell.

19:18.933 --> 19:20.717
You are lucky that I don't take
this mockery

19:20.802 --> 19:23.186
of a final resting place
and shove it up your ass.

19:23.271 --> 19:25.105
- Louis, that's enough.
- No, it's not enough.

19:25.223 --> 19:27.107
I've been handling this bullshit
for two days

19:27.225 --> 19:29.476
for a woman who's supposed to be
handling things for me.

19:29.611 --> 19:30.727
Louis, this isn't
about the urn.

19:30.812 --> 19:32.692
Oh, please don't give me
that touchy-feely shit.

19:32.730 --> 19:33.897
And why the hell
are you not being bad cop?

19:34.032 --> 19:35.312
Because that's not
what's needed.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.900
Oh, bullshit
it's not what's needed.

19:36.985 --> 19:38.402
- Louis.
- You don't care about me.

19:38.486 --> 19:39.953
You never cared about me.

19:40.071 --> 19:42.406
All you care about
is yourself...

19:42.540 --> 19:45.375
and your stupid sister
and your Hummel figurines

19:45.460 --> 19:47.077
and your <i> Murder, She Wrote</i>
reruns.

19:47.211 --> 19:48.745
Louis, I'm not Norma.

19:50.915 --> 19:53.083
She's gone...

19:53.251 --> 19:54.251
and it's gonna be okay.

19:54.385 --> 19:56.253
She was a battle-ax!

20:02.260 --> 20:06.430
But she was my battle-ax.

20:06.597 --> 20:09.149
I know. I know.

20:09.267 --> 20:11.151
Oh, she didn't just leave me
high and dry.

20:11.269 --> 20:12.769
She left me for good.

20:12.904 --> 20:14.571
I'm so sorry.

20:14.689 --> 20:16.773
It's okay.

20:19.277 --> 20:20.861
Both of you?

20:20.945 --> 20:22.079
We both work for you.

20:22.163 --> 20:23.523
Which is why we're both here
to say

20:23.614 --> 20:26.783
maybe it's time
we explore other options.

20:26.868 --> 20:27.868
You got to be kidding me.

20:27.869 --> 20:28.785
You spent two days on this,

20:28.920 --> 20:30.440
and you're ready
to throw in the towel?

20:30.455 --> 20:31.788
We've spent two
of our five days on it,

20:31.956 --> 20:33.006
and we still don't have
a name,

20:33.124 --> 20:35.125
so we think
it's time to consider--

20:35.259 --> 20:36.259
What?

20:36.294 --> 20:38.128
Going after Forstman

20:38.296 --> 20:39.856
for whatever he did to you
12 years ago.

20:41.966 --> 20:43.216
- You told her?
- Yes, I did.

20:43.301 --> 20:45.218
Because like I said,
we both work for you.

20:45.353 --> 20:46.636
Which means
we both want to help.

20:46.721 --> 20:48.801
You think I haven't wondered
how to go after Forstman

20:48.806 --> 20:50.126
100 times
in the last dozen years?

20:50.141 --> 20:51.141
Then why don't you?

20:51.275 --> 20:52.715
Because I'm not the only one
at risk.

20:52.727 --> 20:55.362
You mean your brother.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.613
Yes, I do.

20:56.698 --> 20:58.065
And I'm not gonna bring him
into this,

20:58.149 --> 20:59.566
because he didn't do
anything wrong.

20:59.650 --> 21:01.151
Harvey, I'm not saying--

21:01.235 --> 21:03.236
Did you hear me?

21:03.321 --> 21:04.905
He doesn't just have a gun
to my head, okay?

21:04.989 --> 21:06.109
He's got one
to my brother's.

21:06.157 --> 21:07.324
And how many times
have you told me

21:07.492 --> 21:08.909
that when someone has
a gun to your head,

21:09.043 --> 21:09.910
you figure
a different way out?

21:09.994 --> 21:11.728
This is Charles Forstman.

21:11.829 --> 21:13.547
- There is no other way out.
- Harvey, there's--

21:13.681 --> 21:15.832
I gave you a job to do.
Now do your goddamn job.

21:27.106 --> 21:28.106
Well, that was a bust.

21:28.107 --> 21:29.486
- We had to try.
- Did we?

21:29.487 --> 21:30.604
I told you he'd be pissed off,
and he was.

21:30.772 --> 21:32.156
Yeah, and you also told me
he needed to hear things

21:32.273 --> 21:33.157
that he didn't want to hear.

21:33.274 --> 21:34.575
Okay, well,
now all he heard is,

21:34.659 --> 21:36.577
not only can't he trust me,
he can't trust you either.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.162
That's not what he heard,
and you know it.

21:38.279 --> 21:40.159
What he heard was that
you're the closest person

21:40.198 --> 21:41.198
in the world to me,

21:41.199 --> 21:42.583
I am never gonna
keep things from you,

21:42.667 --> 21:44.284
and I'm not the only one
in his corner.

21:44.369 --> 21:46.370
I'm the closest person
in the world to you.

21:46.504 --> 21:47.421
Of course you are.
How can you even--

21:47.505 --> 21:48.539
I'm not questioning it.

21:48.623 --> 21:51.291
I'm the closest person
in the world to you,

21:51.376 --> 21:54.461
and I wouldn't be
on your family tree.

21:54.596 --> 21:55.462
You're talking
about Woodall.

21:55.547 --> 21:56.797
Yes, I'm talking
about Woodall.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.599
Woodall's married.
We checked his wife. Nothing.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.134
That's the thing.
We're not married.

22:00.301 --> 22:01.635
Okay, I really don't think this
is the time to bring that up.

22:01.770 --> 22:03.020
I'm being serious.

22:03.138 --> 22:04.555
We've exhausted every person
that's related to him.

22:04.639 --> 22:07.274
Maybe it's time
we found someone who isn't.

22:10.145 --> 22:12.029
- That's genius.
- Thank you.

22:12.147 --> 22:15.566
Now I really don't understand
why Harvey doesn't respect you.

22:15.700 --> 22:16.700
It's too soon.

22:16.735 --> 22:19.536
It's too soon
for that joke.

22:19.654 --> 22:21.038
Too soon.

22:24.325 --> 22:27.077
I can have any one?

22:27.162 --> 22:28.629
Take your pick.

22:28.713 --> 22:30.497
It doesn't matter,
'cause you're gonna lose.

22:30.665 --> 22:31.665
That's funny.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.467
I look at it like
I'm gonna win twice.

22:33.551 --> 22:36.670
I get to drive a badass car,
and I get to kick your ass.

22:36.755 --> 22:38.555
Cocky. I like that.

22:38.673 --> 22:40.433
A guy like you,
I'm surprised you could stand

22:40.475 --> 22:42.593
working for Cameron Dennis
in the first place.

22:42.727 --> 22:44.447
- What do you mean?
- He doesn't like cocky.

22:44.512 --> 22:46.730
Take, for instance,
what's-his-name--DuPont?

22:46.848 --> 22:48.365
What's he up for?
Tax evasion?

22:48.516 --> 22:49.916
- Insider trading.
- Yeah, whatever.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.786
The point is, after
what you did the other day,

22:52.871 --> 22:54.188
why aren't you leading that?

22:54.339 --> 22:55.506
Because this is Cameron's case.

22:55.573 --> 22:58.192
If I were him,
it'd be yours.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.928
Harvey,
you are his star player,

23:01.029 --> 23:03.197
and he's not even putting you
in the game.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.199
And on top of that,
he didn't have the balls

23:05.350 --> 23:07.751
to announce whether
he's going after DuPont or not.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.326
Don't you worry
about Cameron Dennis.

23:09.437 --> 23:13.690
DuPont's gonna get
what's coming to him.

23:13.775 --> 23:15.526
That's exactly what
I wanted to hear.

23:15.643 --> 23:18.028
What are you talking about?

23:18.113 --> 23:19.196
Well, you're loyal to the guy
you work for.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.231
I like that.

23:21.366 --> 23:22.886
So you were just
talking shit about him

23:22.901 --> 23:23.901
to see if I'd jump on board?

23:23.985 --> 23:26.737
And you didn't...

23:26.821 --> 23:29.656
which is why
we don't have to race anymore.

23:29.741 --> 23:30.741
You're saying I got the job?

23:30.825 --> 23:33.894
I'm saying welcome
to the team.

23:34.028 --> 23:35.779
Well, that's all
well and good, Charles,

23:35.897 --> 23:37.564
but we're still racing.

23:37.649 --> 23:38.782
We sure as hell are.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.984
We just have to find
something else to bet on.

23:43.238 --> 23:44.278
Hey, Sean.
Good to see you.

23:44.339 --> 23:45.539
Don't give me that shit.

23:45.673 --> 23:47.574
Did you confront Eric Woodall
yesterday morning

23:47.759 --> 23:48.575
at his supermarket?

23:48.726 --> 23:50.227
I ran into him
by accident.

23:50.311 --> 23:51.578
I like the produce there.

23:51.729 --> 23:53.180
I'm not in the mood, Harvey.

23:53.248 --> 23:56.016
Did you approach the subject
of an SEC investigation

23:56.084 --> 23:58.735
with the express purpose
of intimidating him?

23:58.803 --> 24:00.804
I approached him
with the express purpose

24:00.922 --> 24:02.055
of hiring me
as his lawyer.

24:02.140 --> 24:03.340
Why the hell
would you do that?

24:03.341 --> 24:04.621
You're supposed to be
helping me.

24:04.642 --> 24:06.310
And if he's willing to
admit what he did,

24:06.427 --> 24:07.427
that is helping you.

24:07.428 --> 24:08.628
And instead,
he's claiming that

24:08.730 --> 24:10.430
I sent you there
to intimidate him.

24:10.565 --> 24:12.205
Then I guess
that's the way it's breaking.

24:12.267 --> 24:13.567
What the hell
are you talking about?

24:13.651 --> 24:15.131
He's either gonna buy
what I'm selling

24:15.186 --> 24:16.436
or cover his tracks.

24:16.521 --> 24:19.439
And if he covers his tracks,
you need to be there.

24:19.574 --> 24:20.991
Are you asking me
to follow him?

24:21.109 --> 24:22.776
No, I'm telling you
to follow him.

24:22.861 --> 24:24.661
I can't do that.
I don't have authorization.

24:24.779 --> 24:26.330
Didn't stop you
following me.

24:26.447 --> 24:28.248
Enough.

24:28.366 --> 24:31.201
He's filing charges
of harassment against me.

24:31.336 --> 24:32.786
We do this,
nothing sticks.

24:32.921 --> 24:35.122
Then we might not get him,
because I have nothing.

24:35.290 --> 24:37.170
Well, let me give you
a little extra motivation.

24:37.175 --> 24:38.792
Remember,
Woodall knows all about

24:38.927 --> 24:40.961
Louis Litt's
little Forstman transgression.

24:41.095 --> 24:43.347
So if he gets exonerated,

24:43.464 --> 24:46.550
who do you think's gonna be
the first person he goes after?

24:46.684 --> 24:48.719
So, instead of going to Jersey
for your produce,

24:48.853 --> 24:50.387
go get me something
I can use.

25:03.651 --> 25:05.402
You're having a drink
by yourself?

25:05.486 --> 25:07.654
What's going on?

25:07.789 --> 25:09.122
What's going on is,

25:09.240 --> 25:14.328
I just finished having them
scrape Jeff's name off his door.

25:14.462 --> 25:16.382
So why don't you tell me
why you're here, Harvey?

25:16.497 --> 25:18.215
Cahill's having trouble
getting evidence

25:18.333 --> 25:19.493
against Forstman and Woodall.

25:19.584 --> 25:20.801
I'm aware of that.

25:20.885 --> 25:23.086
Then you should also be aware
that if Woodall keeps his job,

25:23.171 --> 25:24.471
he's likely to go after Louis.

25:24.589 --> 25:26.890
I could've done that math,
and so could you, so...

25:27.008 --> 25:30.928
I might be able to
help them get Forstman...

25:31.062 --> 25:33.397
on something else.

25:33.514 --> 25:34.932
Does this have
something to do

25:35.016 --> 25:37.351
with when he offered you
that job 12 years ago?

25:37.485 --> 25:39.820
Yes.

25:42.073 --> 25:43.313
I told you
that man was trouble.

25:43.408 --> 25:45.826
And I told you
I wouldn't abandon Marcus

25:45.944 --> 25:48.195
and you were wrong
about him.

25:48.329 --> 25:49.913
So this has something to do
with Marcus.

25:50.031 --> 25:53.583
Yes, it does.

25:53.701 --> 25:56.586
Well, if you are asking me
to choose

25:56.704 --> 25:59.172
between your brother and Louis,
you know who I'm choosing.

25:59.290 --> 26:00.841
I'm not asking you
to do that.

26:00.925 --> 26:01.925
Then what are you asking?

26:01.960 --> 26:05.712
I want your help
to get my mind right.

26:05.797 --> 26:09.716
Here's the thing, Harvey.

26:09.801 --> 26:12.552
Jeff's gone,

26:12.637 --> 26:15.555
and he's gone
because of the choices I made.

26:17.892 --> 26:20.894
So I'm not sure if I can
help you get your mind right,

26:20.979 --> 26:23.213
'cause right now...

26:23.298 --> 26:25.415
mine's not right.

26:30.822 --> 26:34.074
Hang on a sec.

26:34.208 --> 26:35.208
Hey.

26:35.209 --> 26:37.494
Hey.

26:37.578 --> 26:39.997
You didn't come down here
just to give me my start date.

26:40.081 --> 26:41.298
I came down here to tell you

26:41.416 --> 26:42.776
I think
you have something special,

26:42.917 --> 26:44.835
and I'd love nothing more
than to have you on my desk,

26:44.969 --> 26:48.255
but I'm leaving
the DA's office.

26:48.339 --> 26:50.419
Does this have something to do
with that Forstman guy

26:50.425 --> 26:51.785
buying you a drink
the other night?

26:51.843 --> 26:53.427
I thought you didn't know
who he was.

26:53.511 --> 26:54.671
Well, I looked him up

26:54.679 --> 26:57.230
because I thought
I was gonna be working for you.

26:57.315 --> 26:59.483
And I'm telling you,
he's shady.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.920
Because he's got
a bad reputation?

27:00.985 --> 27:04.154
I don't care
what his reputation is.

27:04.272 --> 27:07.491
You don't know this about me
yet, but I know people...

27:07.608 --> 27:09.242
usually better
than they know themselves.

27:09.327 --> 27:12.329
And the same way
I know you are a good person,

27:12.447 --> 27:14.581
I can tell you that man
is rotten to the core.

27:14.699 --> 27:16.099
You're just trying
to get me to stay

27:16.117 --> 27:16.950
so you can work at my desk.

27:18.119 --> 27:19.870
Listen to me.

27:19.954 --> 27:22.873
I don't care whether
I work on your desk or not.

27:22.957 --> 27:25.008
You're making a mistake
if you take a job with that man.

27:25.126 --> 27:26.446
Then I guess
I'm making a mistake,

27:26.511 --> 27:28.378
because I already did.

27:28.513 --> 27:31.181
It was nice
knowing you, Donna.

27:38.639 --> 27:40.524
So you're keeping her here
after all.

27:44.145 --> 27:45.562
Yeah, I couldn't throw her
off the roof

27:45.646 --> 27:46.646
after you got me to cry.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.198
I'm glad.

27:48.316 --> 27:49.566
Donna, I can't thank you enough
for what you did.

27:49.650 --> 27:52.652
Oh, you're welcome,
Louis.

27:52.737 --> 27:56.456
The truth is, I needed this
more than you know.

27:56.574 --> 27:58.158
Well, I get it.

27:58.242 --> 27:59.242
You needed a distraction

27:59.327 --> 28:01.628
after everything
you just went through.

28:01.712 --> 28:04.214
Uh, yeah.
Something like that.

28:04.332 --> 28:06.666
Truth is,

28:06.834 --> 28:09.002
I could use a distraction
myself.

28:09.137 --> 28:10.971
Well, there is one thing
that you still need to do.

28:11.055 --> 28:15.142
You need to start thinking
about a new secretary.

28:15.259 --> 28:18.645
Donna, I know
I've asked you this before,

28:18.729 --> 28:20.897
but we're so much closer now
than we were then, and--

28:21.015 --> 28:22.649
Louis, I work for Harvey.

28:22.733 --> 28:24.184
You know
I can't be your secretary.

28:24.268 --> 28:28.488
But we have this bond...

28:28.573 --> 28:30.240
you and I.

28:30.358 --> 28:32.909
Shakespeare,
the gun club.

28:33.027 --> 28:35.187
We've always spoken the same
language, and you know it.

28:35.196 --> 28:36.530
Louis, I can't.

28:36.664 --> 28:38.165
I get it.

28:41.586 --> 28:42.752
We're better as friends.

28:42.870 --> 28:45.589
Hey.

28:45.706 --> 28:48.625
How about I set up
a little farewell for Norma

28:48.759 --> 28:51.878
as my last official act
as your interim secretary?

28:55.216 --> 28:56.383
Thank you, Donna.

29:09.332 --> 29:10.415
Are you sure
we've got the right address?

29:10.583 --> 29:11.917
I'm positive.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.091
I'll be right back.

29:13.469 --> 29:14.719
Can I help you?

29:14.837 --> 29:17.285
Uh, yes, is there
a Mary Ann McGrath here?

29:17.286 --> 29:18.452
Who can I say is asking?

29:18.570 --> 29:19.820
We're with
Pearson Specter Litt.

29:19.904 --> 29:22.039
We'd like to speak with her
in regards to an ongoing case.

29:22.157 --> 29:23.574
I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

29:23.658 --> 29:25.659
You just said she was here.
I don't understand--

29:25.744 --> 29:27.661
Mary Ann has
advanced Alzheimer's.

29:27.796 --> 29:29.246
But she's 55.

29:29.381 --> 29:32.249
It's early onset, and hers is
particularly aggressive.

29:32.384 --> 29:33.384
I'm sorry.

29:33.418 --> 29:34.418
Can I ask how long
she's been a patient?

29:34.586 --> 29:35.986
We're not supposed to
disclose any--

29:36.004 --> 29:39.006
Please.
It's really important.

29:39.140 --> 29:40.940
She was moved her
about a year and a half ago.

29:41.009 --> 29:42.009
And before that?

29:42.010 --> 29:43.844
I don't really know,

29:43.979 --> 29:46.430
but I don't think
she was getting the best care.

29:46.598 --> 29:49.266
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:56.274 --> 30:00.027
My mother's 55.

30:00.111 --> 30:02.446
You know, and if she's only here
because Forstman pays for it--

30:02.580 --> 30:03.580
I know.

30:03.581 --> 30:04.832
Harvey wants us to find

30:04.949 --> 30:06.250
the person
Woodall's close to.

30:06.334 --> 30:07.334
That's all we can do.

30:07.369 --> 30:08.502
Well, "all we can do"

30:08.620 --> 30:10.540
is gonna send her back
to some horrible facility.

30:10.588 --> 30:12.268
- We don't exactly know that.
- Yes, we do.

30:12.290 --> 30:15.959
Rachel, it's terrible.

30:16.094 --> 30:17.344
I don't like it
any more than you do,

30:17.462 --> 30:19.596
but it's not up to us.

30:19.681 --> 30:22.433
I know.

30:22.517 --> 30:25.969
It just sucks.

30:26.104 --> 30:28.889
You goddamn liar.

30:28.973 --> 30:30.891
Oh, don't be mad.

30:30.975 --> 30:33.143
Yeah, Conchita tells everybody
I'm not home.

30:33.311 --> 30:34.728
You know what
I'm talking about.

30:34.863 --> 30:36.864
DuPont Investments
dropped through the floor today,

30:36.981 --> 30:38.148
and you sold short

30:38.283 --> 30:40.901
based on something
that I told you in confidence.

30:40.985 --> 30:42.953
I don't recall you telling me
anything at all.

30:43.071 --> 30:44.071
You son of a bitch.

30:44.205 --> 30:45.823
You made over $100 million
on that trade.

30:45.907 --> 30:47.374
Yeah, I did.

30:47.492 --> 30:49.159
Welcome
to the real world, pal.

30:49.294 --> 30:51.795
My real world doesn't involve
befriending young attorneys

30:51.913 --> 30:53.380
to get inside information.

30:53.498 --> 30:55.833
Maybe you're not the right man
for me after all.

30:55.967 --> 30:57.718
You think I still want
to work for you after this?

30:57.836 --> 30:59.420
You wanted competition
and money.

30:59.504 --> 31:02.339
You got the competition.

31:02.424 --> 31:03.507
Here's your money.

31:03.641 --> 31:05.642
You can shove that $1 million
up your ass,

31:05.727 --> 31:07.845
because I'm not only
not taking your job,

31:07.929 --> 31:09.063
I'm gonna prosecute you.

31:09.180 --> 31:11.300
Then you might as well
add your name to the indictment

31:11.316 --> 31:13.350
since you've already
shared in the profits.

31:13.518 --> 31:14.852
What are you talking about?

31:14.936 --> 31:16.353
Take a look at this check.

31:16.438 --> 31:18.238
It's not $1 million.

31:18.356 --> 31:21.024
It's 850,000.

31:21.159 --> 31:23.861
Bet you can guess where
the other $150,000 went.

31:23.995 --> 31:24.995
What did you do?

31:24.996 --> 31:27.664
You know what I did.

31:27.749 --> 31:29.533
Marcus had nothing to do
with this.

31:29.667 --> 31:31.702
He wouldn't have had you said
yes right away.

31:31.786 --> 31:32.786
But you didn't.

31:32.837 --> 31:34.621
We're giving you
the money back.

31:34.706 --> 31:36.540
You're gonna break
his little heart.

31:36.674 --> 31:38.509
He thinks that money
came from you.

31:38.593 --> 31:41.879
And you snatch cash out
of an addicted gambler's hands,

31:42.013 --> 31:43.464
take away his dream,

31:43.548 --> 31:45.299
only one way
that story ends.

31:45.383 --> 31:48.268
So you can either
pout about it...

31:48.386 --> 31:51.388
or you can embrace it and
prove to everyone I was right

31:51.473 --> 31:54.608
when I said I saw
something special in you.

31:54.726 --> 31:57.561
Someday the shoe's gonna be
on the other foot, Charles.

31:57.645 --> 32:00.314
Words spoken by every loser
I've ever met.

32:00.398 --> 32:02.533
See you around, pal.

32:10.792 --> 32:13.043
It's Woodall's first wife.

32:13.128 --> 32:14.962
Her name's Mary Ann.
They grew up together.

32:15.079 --> 32:17.080
They got married
when they were 21

32:17.248 --> 32:18.688
and had it annulled
six months later.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.634
And what's the money for?

32:20.752 --> 32:22.586
- She has Alzheimer's.
- Don't tell me.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.080
He moved her
to a high-end facility

32:24.088 --> 32:25.422
and pays
for round-the-clock care.

32:25.590 --> 32:27.057
And the problem is,
we called the company

32:27.142 --> 32:28.342
that handles
the billing, and--

32:28.343 --> 32:29.676
And everything's in cash
up front,

32:29.761 --> 32:31.345
probably paid five years
in advance.

32:31.479 --> 32:34.481
And Mary Ann couldn't tell you
because she doesn't speak.

32:34.599 --> 32:38.652
Which mean we don't have
any proof.

32:38.770 --> 32:39.770
Where are you going?

32:39.938 --> 32:42.689
I'm gonna go get us
some proof.

32:42.824 --> 32:43.824
You did this?

32:43.858 --> 32:44.942
Mike and I both did.

32:45.076 --> 32:46.410
Then why isn't he here?

32:46.494 --> 32:47.694
You know why.

32:47.829 --> 32:50.414
Because it was more you
than him.

32:50.532 --> 32:51.612
You did a good job, Rachel.

32:55.036 --> 32:59.089
Shopping, renting videos.

32:59.174 --> 33:01.625
You must be going stir-crazy.

33:01.759 --> 33:03.427
That's all right.

33:03.545 --> 33:06.213
My suspension
is about to expire.

33:06.297 --> 33:07.777
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.

33:07.882 --> 33:09.132
We found Mary Ann.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.218
I'm told she's doing well
at the new facility--

33:11.352 --> 33:13.220
you know,
the one Forstman's paying for.

33:16.441 --> 33:19.726
You son of a bitch.

33:19.861 --> 33:21.728
I'm not here to exploit
your tragedy, Eric.

33:21.813 --> 33:23.113
I'm here to tell you
it's over.

33:23.198 --> 33:24.231
Well, if this were over,

33:24.365 --> 33:26.533
you'd be with Sean Cahill
right now,

33:26.651 --> 33:28.619
which means you're still looking
for me to cut a deal.

33:28.703 --> 33:30.487
I'm looking for you
to turn on Forstman.

33:30.655 --> 33:32.573
You accost me
for the second time

33:32.707 --> 33:35.209
in three days
and throw Mary Ann's name around

33:35.326 --> 33:37.160
like a bargaining chip,

33:37.295 --> 33:39.129
and you think
I'm gonna help you?

33:39.247 --> 33:40.247
Drop dead.

33:43.418 --> 33:45.552
Eric, please.

33:45.670 --> 33:47.754
The reason I knew to look
for someone that you cared about

33:47.889 --> 33:49.139
was that Forstman did
the same thing to me.

33:49.257 --> 33:52.142
He finds your weakness
and presses down

33:52.227 --> 33:54.394
until you don't have
the will to stand up to him.

33:54.512 --> 33:57.481
With you, it was an ex-wife
with Alzheimer's.

33:57.599 --> 34:00.317
With me...

34:00.435 --> 34:03.353
it was a little brother
addicted to gambling.

34:03.488 --> 34:05.439
I don't care.

34:05.523 --> 34:06.907
You don't have proof,

34:07.025 --> 34:08.945
and you're not gonna get it
in the next 24 hours.

34:09.027 --> 34:10.027
You're right. I don't.

34:10.078 --> 34:11.862
But here's the thing.

34:12.030 --> 34:14.864
Cahill may have a deadline,
but I don't,

34:14.998 --> 34:16.533
and I don't care
how long it takes,

34:16.668 --> 34:18.168
because I'm gonna find
that proof

34:18.286 --> 34:19.703
if you don't turn
on Forstman.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.065
A lot of you don't know this,

34:36.427 --> 34:39.596
but the truth is,
I hated Norma.

34:39.764 --> 34:42.431
I hated her clogs,

34:42.567 --> 34:44.434
her mustache,

34:44.569 --> 34:47.187
her stupid
seasonal sweaters.

34:47.321 --> 34:50.190
But the thing
I hated most about her

34:50.324 --> 34:52.109
was her favorite story

34:52.243 --> 34:56.112
about how Abe Vigoda asked her
to marry him in 1975.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.497
I mean, we get it.

34:57.615 --> 34:58.999
You were hot.

34:59.117 --> 35:00.200
You turned him down,

35:00.334 --> 35:02.169
and it was the biggest regret
of your life.

35:02.286 --> 35:04.588
And like everything
you ever said,

35:04.705 --> 35:06.757
I couldn't stand it
at the time.

35:06.874 --> 35:10.210
But now that you're gone,

35:10.344 --> 35:13.713
I understand what you meant.

35:13.848 --> 35:17.801
Don't let the moment pass.

35:17.969 --> 35:19.770
Don't let the people you love
walk by you

35:19.887 --> 35:22.439
without letting them know
how you feel about them,

35:22.557 --> 35:25.809
because life slips by,
and then it's over.

35:25.943 --> 35:28.145
And I'm not gonna let
another minute pass me by

35:28.229 --> 35:31.481
without letting you know
how much you mean to me.

35:35.570 --> 35:37.954
I love you, Norma.

35:43.327 --> 35:45.462
Thank you, Louis.

35:45.546 --> 35:47.330
That was
a lovely ceremony.

36:03.347 --> 36:05.315
That was beautiful, Louis.

36:05.433 --> 36:06.833
I couldn't have done it
without you.

36:06.851 --> 36:09.019
- Oh, that's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

36:09.153 --> 36:13.023
I couldn't even see how I felt
without you showing me.

36:13.107 --> 36:14.107
And the truth is, Donna,

36:14.242 --> 36:18.195
you know me better
than I know myself.

36:18.279 --> 36:23.166
Like I said,
Harvey has no idea

36:23.284 --> 36:24.835
how lucky he is
to have you.

36:27.955 --> 36:35.846
♪ ♪

36:53.197 --> 37:01.071
♪ ♪

37:13.551 --> 37:14.791
Looking for the money

37:14.886 --> 37:16.253
I supposedly gave
Eric Woodall?

37:16.387 --> 37:20.090
You want to save me the trouble
and just admit what you did?

37:20.258 --> 37:21.925
Now, where would be the fun
in that?

37:22.009 --> 37:24.644
Fine.
Keep playing your games,

37:24.762 --> 37:26.042
but this time,
you're gonna lose.

37:26.147 --> 37:28.315
Why, because you think
you convinced Woodall

37:28.432 --> 37:31.101
to give me up?

37:31.185 --> 37:32.986
Yeah, he came to see me.

37:33.104 --> 37:34.738
Said you tried to get him
to turn me in.

37:34.822 --> 37:37.774
What I said was,
you're an arrogant bastard

37:37.858 --> 37:40.827
who's spent his life
manipulating people.

37:40.945 --> 37:44.614
And you're the loser who
only cares about competition.

37:45.700 --> 37:47.117
Not my fault
you can't beat me.

37:47.251 --> 37:48.618
I can this time.

37:48.703 --> 37:52.505
Oh, I don't think so, pal,
because...

37:52.623 --> 37:55.342
he turns on me,
I turn on you.

37:55.459 --> 37:57.510
If you're talking about
12 years ago, let me remind you.

37:57.628 --> 37:58.712
We were both part
of that deal.

37:58.796 --> 38:00.347
Yes, we were.

38:00.464 --> 38:03.300
All three of us were--
you, me, and your brother.

38:03.434 --> 38:04.714
You leave my brother
out of this.

38:04.719 --> 38:05.852
Not a chance.

38:05.970 --> 38:08.138
And you don't leave
this Woodall thing alone,

38:08.222 --> 38:10.140
by the time I'm done,

38:10.274 --> 38:12.275
all anybody will know
about 12 years ago

38:12.360 --> 38:13.526
is you gave me a tip

38:13.644 --> 38:15.946
and made sure your little
brother profited from it.

38:16.063 --> 38:17.948
I didn't give you shit.

38:18.065 --> 38:20.367
You tricked me into giving you
inside information

38:20.484 --> 38:21.785
and then blackmailed me

38:21.902 --> 38:24.371
by giving Marcus money
he didn't even know was dirty.

38:24.488 --> 38:26.656
That may be the truth,

38:26.741 --> 38:30.160
but they're never gonna
hear it from me.

38:30.328 --> 38:33.830
I'm afraid
they just did.

38:33.965 --> 38:34.965
Hi, Charles.

38:34.966 --> 38:36.833
Sean Cahill.
Nice to meet you.

38:36.917 --> 38:38.551
Who the hell are you?

38:38.669 --> 38:41.221
I'm the guy from the SEC
that isn't in your pocket.

38:41.339 --> 38:42.639
I asked Sean
to follow Woodall.

38:42.757 --> 38:44.975
Couldn't.
No authorization.

38:45.059 --> 38:46.760
But I had no problem
getting authorization

38:46.894 --> 38:47.927
to follow you.

38:48.062 --> 38:51.314
Which is how I knew
when to turn this on.

38:51.399 --> 38:53.566
You're wearing
a goddamn wire?

38:53.684 --> 38:55.986
For someone whose favorite movie
is <i> Wall Street,</i>

38:56.070 --> 38:57.654
that's got to be
pretty embarrassing.

38:57.738 --> 38:59.022
Son of a bitch.

38:59.156 --> 39:01.741
You may have gotten the better
of me 12 years ago, Charles,

39:01.859 --> 39:03.910
but this time, you didn't.

39:04.028 --> 39:07.247
So remember what it feels like,
because I know I will.

39:07.365 --> 39:10.500
Harvey, this isn't over.

39:10.618 --> 39:13.169
Words spoken by every loser
I've ever met.

39:13.254 --> 39:15.005
See you around, pal.

39:20.378 --> 39:22.128
Two for two.

39:26.851 --> 39:29.185
He didn't touch my balls.

39:33.357 --> 39:35.525
Black, two sugars,
splash of vanilla.

39:35.643 --> 39:37.363
How do you know
that's how I take my coffee?

39:37.395 --> 39:39.112
The same way I know
you're not taking that job.

39:39.230 --> 39:41.648
You know I'm not taking that job
because I came into work today.

39:41.732 --> 39:42.732
No, Mr. Specter.

39:42.783 --> 39:44.103
I knew you weren't taking
that job

39:44.201 --> 39:46.786
the second you walked away
from me the other night.

39:46.904 --> 39:49.205
I told you I know people better
than they know themselves.

39:49.323 --> 39:51.458
Well, what did you do
with Tina?

39:51.575 --> 39:53.126
Oh, I had Big Bertha
reassign her.

39:53.244 --> 39:55.795
- To who?
- Do you really care?

39:55.913 --> 39:57.130
- Not a bit.
- Good.

39:57.248 --> 39:59.299
Here's the deal.

39:59.417 --> 40:01.835
I will take a bullet for you.

40:01.919 --> 40:03.670
And I don't mean that
literally.

40:03.754 --> 40:05.422
But what you do for me is,

40:05.556 --> 40:07.006
when I need something,
you give it to me.

40:07.091 --> 40:09.426
It's not just
a one-way street.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.761
Will you also do some actual
secretarial work?

40:11.896 --> 40:14.848
Take a look at what I did with
your calendar there, hotshot.

40:14.982 --> 40:16.066
Holy shit.

40:16.183 --> 40:17.743
When'd you get that done?

40:17.818 --> 40:20.603
I told you I'm not like
every other secretary.

40:20.738 --> 40:23.273
I'm Donna.

40:23.407 --> 40:24.908
Then let's get to work.

40:24.992 --> 40:28.912
But for the record, I don't take
vanilla with my coffee.

40:28.996 --> 40:31.197
You will
after you taste that.

40:31.332 --> 40:33.416
Oh, my God,
this is awesome.

40:33.534 --> 40:35.502
When will they learn?

40:50.050 --> 40:51.134
Perfect timing.

40:51.218 --> 40:52.635
And what are we celebrating?

40:52.720 --> 40:55.772
Our win.

40:55.890 --> 40:58.525
"Our win."

40:58.642 --> 41:00.727
- I like the sound of that.
- Me too.

41:00.811 --> 41:02.228
Where were you?

41:02.313 --> 41:03.863
I'll get into that
in a minute.

41:03.981 --> 41:05.532
I want to talk to you
for a second.

41:05.649 --> 41:06.900
What is it?

41:06.984 --> 41:10.153
Rachel, you know I told you
I loved you

41:10.287 --> 41:11.371
from the second I met you.

41:11.489 --> 41:13.790
Well, you loved
my pencil skirt.

41:13.874 --> 41:14.874
I loved your face.

41:19.830 --> 41:20.914
♪ ♪

41:20.998 --> 41:25.084
You're the most amazing woman
I have ever met,

41:25.169 --> 41:29.255
and you're not
just beautiful,

41:29.340 --> 41:33.927
but you're sweet
and caring and kind

41:34.011 --> 41:36.346
and brilliant
and tenacious.

41:36.480 --> 41:39.315
Mike, are--

41:39.433 --> 41:42.685
are you doing
what I think you're doing?

41:45.356 --> 41:48.191
I called your father today.

41:48.325 --> 41:50.443
And then I went to get
Grammy's ring cleaned.

41:50.528 --> 41:51.694
Oh, my--

41:51.829 --> 41:52.912
I don't want to go 40 years

41:53.030 --> 41:55.532
wondering why I didn't do this
one day sooner.

42:01.372 --> 42:05.041
Rachel Elizabeth Zane...

42:05.125 --> 42:07.510
I love you...

42:07.595 --> 42:10.713
and I always will.

42:10.798 --> 42:13.349
You're my whole life.

42:15.352 --> 42:16.636
Will you marry me?

42:16.720 --> 42:18.888
Yes.

42:19.023 --> 42:20.690
- Yes?
- Yes.

42:26.230 --> 42:27.063
Oh, my God.

42:27.198 --> 42:29.065
All right, here...

42:31.569 --> 42:33.403
Oh.

42:33.571 --> 42:35.405
Oh, my God.

42:38.409 --> 42:41.461
It's beautiful.

42:41.579 --> 42:44.547
She wore it every day
for almost 60 years.

42:44.665 --> 42:47.050
So will I.

43:01.815 --> 43:02.935
What's up, dickhead?

43:03.100 --> 43:04.100
What's up, loser?

43:04.101 --> 43:05.818
Hey, Harvey.
Good to hear from you.

43:05.936 --> 43:07.737
What's going on?
Everything okay?

43:07.821 --> 43:09.105
Yeah, everything's okay.

43:09.240 --> 43:10.607
I just haven't talked to you
in a while

43:10.741 --> 43:12.025
and wanted to see
how you were doing.

43:12.159 --> 43:13.443
I'm great.
Katie's good.

43:13.611 --> 43:15.662
The kids are good.
Everything's good.

43:15.779 --> 43:17.080
Great.

43:17.197 --> 43:19.449
That's exactly what
I wanted to hear.

43:19.583 --> 43:21.284
You sure
there's nothing going on?

43:21.368 --> 43:22.702
Nothing.

43:22.836 --> 43:25.121
Like I said, I just haven't
talked to you in a while,

43:25.289 --> 43:26.839
and I miss you.

43:26.957 --> 43:29.125
I miss you too, Harvey, but
unless you got something else,

43:29.209 --> 43:30.209
I've got to go.

43:30.261 --> 43:31.544
The kids are in the bath.

43:31.679 --> 43:32.962
Nothing else.

43:33.097 --> 43:35.431
Love you, Harvey.

43:35.549 --> 43:37.050
I love you too.

43:44.475 --> 43:45.608
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:45.693 --> 43:47.777
Listen, I was thinking about
what you said,

43:47.861 --> 43:49.812
about me pitying you.

43:49.897 --> 43:50.947
And I don't.

43:51.031 --> 43:53.199
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

43:53.317 --> 43:55.401
I think you're one of
the most amazing women

43:55.486 --> 43:57.820
I've ever met,
and just because I don't--

43:57.955 --> 43:59.989
- I'm leaving you, Harvey.
- What?

44:00.157 --> 44:04.744
This isn't working
for me anymore.

44:04.828 --> 44:07.130
Donna, I know
how you're feeling,

44:07.214 --> 44:09.165
but you just went
through something huge,

44:09.300 --> 44:13.336
with being on trial,
and, uh...

44:13.420 --> 44:16.506
you need to give it time.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.007
You can't just quit.

44:18.175 --> 44:20.510
I'm not quitting.

44:20.594 --> 44:21.844
I'm going to work for Louis.

44:24.932 --> 44:26.065
Donna.

44:29.987 --> 44:32.238
Donna, please.

44:32.356 --> 44:34.691
I love you, Harvey.
