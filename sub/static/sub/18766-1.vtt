WEBVTT

00:01.644 --> 00:03.828
There is a new player in town. Pandora.

00:03.830 --> 00:05.658
As in the mythical woman with the box?

00:05.692 --> 00:08.260
The Bible foretells that
the two Witnesses must endure

00:08.295 --> 00:09.862
seven tribulations.

00:09.896 --> 00:11.997
Dark Rider of the Apocalypse,

00:12.032 --> 00:13.265
I call you forth.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.301
Horseman, end her!

00:15.335 --> 00:17.436
Death wins in the end.

00:17.470 --> 00:19.150
The box... it's gonna explode again.

00:19.174 --> 00:20.374
No, Abbie!

00:21.341 --> 00:23.275
Crane, never give up hope.

00:25.011 --> 00:27.112
Abbie, no!

00:27.147 --> 00:28.447
She's really gone.

00:28.481 --> 00:29.615
Are you certain

00:29.649 --> 00:30.849
you would not like my company?

00:30.873 --> 00:33.152
I think this is something
I have to do by myself.

00:33.186 --> 00:35.054
Mr. Crane, there must always be

00:35.088 --> 00:36.121
two Witnesses.

00:36.156 --> 00:38.057
When one dies, their
soul does not move on.

00:38.091 --> 00:40.626
Abbie's eternal soul lives on

00:40.660 --> 00:41.660
in someone else.

00:41.695 --> 00:42.815
Some people in D.C.

00:42.839 --> 00:44.163
need to have words with you.

00:44.197 --> 00:46.465
Wherever you are, whoever you are,

00:46.499 --> 00:47.499
I'll find you.

00:51.438 --> 00:53.973
Let's go through this again.

00:54.007 --> 00:55.507
It started in Sleepy Hollow.

00:55.542 --> 00:57.009
No.

00:57.043 --> 01:00.579
I was mortally wounded
in battle in 1781,

01:00.614 --> 01:03.816
and put under a mystical slumber
until I awoke three years ago

01:03.850 --> 01:06.252
in... Sleepy Hollow.

01:06.286 --> 01:09.922
Where you met Abbie Mills.

01:09.956 --> 01:12.491
Yes.

01:12.525 --> 01:14.159
She became my partner.

01:14.194 --> 01:16.161
We joined together to fight evil.

01:16.196 --> 01:17.997
To fight evil?

01:18.031 --> 01:19.331
Yes.

01:19.366 --> 01:21.667
Demons, Horsemen of the Apocalypse,

01:21.701 --> 01:24.336
the ongoing success of
shows about real housewives.

01:24.371 --> 01:25.704
You know, evil.

01:29.142 --> 01:30.976
What is this?

01:31.011 --> 01:33.913
Something akin to what you
try to pass off as lunch?

01:40.153 --> 01:43.322
That was but one battle
against one enemy.

01:44.891 --> 01:47.226
There were many.

01:47.260 --> 01:51.797
And now it's just you... alone.

01:51.831 --> 01:55.768
Which means that no one
is ever going to miss you.

02:00.941 --> 02:02.474
Now, look here.

02:02.509 --> 02:04.189
Why should I continue
with these questions?

02:04.213 --> 02:06.011
You've not told me what I'm doing here.

02:06.046 --> 02:07.846
It's been two weeks, and...

02:07.881 --> 02:11.150
you have not proffered a whit of
clarity regarding my situation.

02:11.184 --> 02:13.385
Where is Director Walters?

02:18.058 --> 02:21.694
Very well. You leave.

02:21.728 --> 02:23.829
But you should alert your cordwainer,

02:23.863 --> 02:25.864
he's not up to snuff.

02:25.899 --> 02:27.466
Your brogues are loosening.

02:29.069 --> 02:30.636
Your shoes are untied.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.108
Oldest trick in the book.

02:36.142 --> 02:38.110
And that's coming from me.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.818 --> 03:20.819
Who are these people?

04:31.691 --> 04:33.459
He just wasn't my type.

04:33.493 --> 04:34.693
- Shocker.
- He was nice.

04:34.727 --> 04:37.696
I mean, he was... he was
cute, but it-it just, it...

04:37.730 --> 04:40.199
Not gonna work. Wasn't gonna work.

04:40.233 --> 04:42.034
Hey, you did not tell
me that he was a vegan,

04:42.068 --> 04:43.202
one of the judgy ones.

04:43.236 --> 04:47.539
And he hummed Katy
Perry, non-ironically.

04:47.574 --> 04:49.374
So he's healthy.

04:49.409 --> 04:50.943
And Katy's awesome.

04:50.977 --> 04:52.778
No. No, no, no.

04:52.812 --> 04:54.880
No good music was written after 1984.

04:54.914 --> 04:57.049
Purple Rain, that's it.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.350
Even my daughter knows that.

04:58.384 --> 04:59.952
You brainwashed her.

04:59.986 --> 05:02.488
It's the same reason she thinks
Jordan is better than LeBron.

05:02.522 --> 05:04.682
When it comes time, she's
gonna know not to date anyone

05:04.706 --> 05:06.258
who doesn't eat steak.

05:06.292 --> 05:08.627
That your priority, red meat and oldies?

05:08.661 --> 05:10.496
Girl's got to have standards.

05:12.699 --> 05:14.333
Look, I...

05:14.367 --> 05:17.569
I know you have your hands full at home.

05:17.604 --> 05:20.172
But you need to stop
finding things wrong

05:20.206 --> 05:22.107
with every guy you meet.

05:22.142 --> 05:24.610
At some point, you've got to
let someone new in your life.

05:24.644 --> 05:26.445
Well, I don't like new people.

05:26.479 --> 05:27.913
I don't like change.

05:27.947 --> 05:29.715
You like being alone?

05:32.719 --> 05:35.087
Things are just a little upside-down

05:35.121 --> 05:37.256
with Molly right now. Okay?

05:37.290 --> 05:38.790
Special Agent Thomas.

05:40.627 --> 05:41.793
What happened?

05:44.164 --> 05:46.098
Seriously?

05:46.132 --> 05:48.100
Okay. We're on the way.

05:48.134 --> 05:49.935
You are never gonna believe this.

06:16.963 --> 06:18.830
Any terror groups claim responsibility?

06:18.865 --> 06:20.098
None so far.

06:20.133 --> 06:21.600
Could be just vandalism.

06:21.634 --> 06:24.436
Tweakers gone wild, that sort of thing.

06:26.139 --> 06:28.473
Holy crap.

06:31.177 --> 06:33.345
Yeah. Don't think tweakers did this.

06:35.315 --> 06:37.816
I'm gonna check out the substructure.

06:45.458 --> 06:47.426
What the...?

06:51.331 --> 06:54.366
Hey, Eric, something's going on up here.

06:57.203 --> 06:59.171
Eric?

06:59.205 --> 07:00.973
Diana, is that you?

07:12.518 --> 07:15.120
Sir, this area is off limits.

07:15.154 --> 07:16.922
Sir?

07:18.825 --> 07:21.827
No, no, no.

07:30.670 --> 07:33.038
Sir, I'll need you to come with me.

07:43.149 --> 07:44.349
Eric!

07:53.626 --> 07:54.693
Are you armed?!

07:55.862 --> 07:56.862
Shoot it!

08:01.634 --> 08:02.834
Have you been injured?

08:03.970 --> 08:06.238
You seem sound.

08:06.272 --> 08:08.307
Who are you?

08:41.335 --> 08:42.919
Who the hell are you?

08:42.919 --> 08:44.677
My name is Ichabod Crane.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.842
And I assure you, that is unnecessary.

08:48.145 --> 08:50.079
I'm a historical advisor.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.233
I've worked for the Sleepy
Hollow Sheriff's Department

08:52.257 --> 08:54.750
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

08:54.785 --> 08:58.354
As you saw by my action, I
am an ally to law enforcement.

08:58.388 --> 09:00.356
What are you doing
here? And who was that?

09:00.390 --> 09:02.191
I appreciate you have many questions,

09:02.225 --> 09:04.560
but I must act quickly
to track this demon.

09:04.594 --> 09:05.728
The longer I tarry, the...

09:05.762 --> 09:06.862
What did you just say?

09:06.897 --> 09:08.137
The longer I tarry, the more...

09:08.161 --> 09:09.895
Did you just say "demon"?

09:10.967 --> 09:13.169
If you do not want the killer to escape,

09:13.203 --> 09:15.071
you must allow me to pursue it.

09:16.373 --> 09:18.274
Otherwise, more souls will end up like

09:18.308 --> 09:19.742
your compatriot.

09:40.297 --> 09:42.398
Sir, I know it sounds unusual...

09:42.432 --> 09:46.068
A monster killed Cortez,
and a British guy saved you?

09:46.103 --> 09:47.369
Where is he now?

09:47.404 --> 09:49.138
He got away because of the glow.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.240
- Right, the glow.
- I didn't make it up.

09:51.274 --> 09:52.914
Look, if you're looking
for psych evalu...

09:52.938 --> 09:54.472
I didn't make it up.

09:55.645 --> 09:58.614
Sir, you know I'm not
one for crazy stories.

09:58.648 --> 10:00.116
Okay?

10:00.150 --> 10:03.319
I saw someone who wasn't
human do something impossible.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.420
And you saw.

10:04.454 --> 10:07.156
Eric's face.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.425
Look, I believe you
think you saw something.

10:10.761 --> 10:13.162
Okay, you just saw your partner
get killed in front of you.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.064
That would mess with anyone's head.

10:15.098 --> 10:17.399
But I file what you told me here,

10:17.434 --> 10:19.602
that kind of thing ruins careers.

10:20.670 --> 10:23.172
Just go home. Get some rest.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.874
We'll take it from here.

10:26.109 --> 10:27.543
Come on.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.316
You owe me answers.

11:40.350 --> 11:41.784
That's a rather demanding attitude

11:41.818 --> 11:43.586
from someone whose life I saved.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.088
Then ran like someone
with something to hide.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.123
Well, the demon's trail grew cold.

11:48.158 --> 11:50.492
So I returned to observe this facility.

11:52.162 --> 11:54.530
Last I was here, men
held me against my will.

11:54.564 --> 11:56.832
They must have abandoned the premises

11:56.867 --> 11:59.468
once I escaped.

11:59.502 --> 12:02.805
I think we can agree
neither of us is a threat.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.445
How did you get here?

12:09.479 --> 12:12.648
These stopway tunnels were
abandoned five years ago.

12:12.682 --> 12:14.483
Environmental problems.

12:14.517 --> 12:16.652
They're covered in a
specific kind of gravel...

12:16.686 --> 12:20.122
pumice and crushed oyster shells.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.491
You left some behind when
you fled the Lincoln Memorial.

12:25.795 --> 12:28.464
Your investigative
skills are prodigious.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.267
They make you take a class
or 20 when you join Homeland.

12:31.301 --> 12:34.169
In that case, you can
assist in tracking the demon.

12:34.204 --> 12:36.005
Stop saying that.

12:36.039 --> 12:37.473
Say what, "demon"?

12:37.507 --> 12:39.975
Well, that's precisely what it was,

12:40.010 --> 12:42.962
- a demon, hellion, foul specter.
- That's impossible. You're crazy. Okay?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.967
I'd guess a possessive
spirit, a dybbuk, perhaps.

12:44.990 --> 12:48.517
Stop! Demons don't exist.

12:48.551 --> 12:50.152
The human capacity for self-denial

12:50.186 --> 12:52.021
never ceases to amaze.

12:52.055 --> 12:54.757
You saw it with your own eyes.

12:54.791 --> 12:56.592
Your partner is dead because of it.

12:56.626 --> 12:58.260
Can you deny that?

12:59.963 --> 13:02.197
No.

13:02.232 --> 13:04.199
And his name was Eric.

13:04.234 --> 13:07.269
I am so sorry.

13:07.304 --> 13:09.305
Truly, actually.

13:09.339 --> 13:11.707
I, too, lost someone.

13:11.741 --> 13:13.575
My partner.

13:13.610 --> 13:16.445
And it is in their memory
that I seek a person,

13:16.479 --> 13:19.148
one who is to inherit her vital legacy.

13:19.182 --> 13:20.382
I believe these blaggards

13:20.417 --> 13:22.151
also seek this person.

13:22.185 --> 13:25.054
That cannot happen.

13:25.088 --> 13:26.648
And the people that you're looking for,

13:26.672 --> 13:28.457
you think they're responsible for the...

13:28.491 --> 13:31.961
thing that killed Eric?

13:31.995 --> 13:33.875
I'd hazard the demon we
encountered was released

13:33.899 --> 13:35.764
when the Lincoln
statue's hex was broken,

13:35.799 --> 13:38.934
which means someone did
this, someone with a plan.

13:38.969 --> 13:40.689
Someone who will continue
to perpetrate evil

13:40.713 --> 13:42.771
until they are stopped.

13:42.806 --> 13:45.407
Now, I know this is overwhelming.

13:45.442 --> 13:46.976
But consider this.

13:47.010 --> 13:48.944
I am the only one who
can find the people

13:48.979 --> 13:50.612
who killed your partner.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.616
This better be good.

14:29.819 --> 14:31.253
All right, slow down.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.755
Slow down.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.957
Wait, wait, shh, listen.

14:34.991 --> 14:38.060
What in the world do
you mean he won't sell?

14:38.094 --> 14:39.795
I am offering him

14:39.829 --> 14:42.097
11.7 times

14:42.132 --> 14:44.433
what his company is worth.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.427
What more could he want?

14:47.670 --> 14:49.438
Listen, listen.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.774
Please tell Mizuyama-San

14:51.808 --> 14:54.443
that I greatly respect what he's built,

14:54.477 --> 14:57.713
but it is high time he let go.

14:57.747 --> 14:59.081
And if he won't do that,

14:59.115 --> 15:02.184
then please tell him that I cannot wait

15:02.218 --> 15:04.420
to find a way to make him

15:04.454 --> 15:06.055
let go.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.427
The market never sleeps.

15:11.461 --> 15:13.695
So close to finishing the ceremony.

15:13.730 --> 15:16.198
Now I have to wait another astral phase.

15:16.232 --> 15:20.135
Where are we on the, um...
the thing with the other thing?

15:20.170 --> 15:23.305
The entity has a confirmed
kill, and it's on the loose.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.607
More will come.

15:25.642 --> 15:28.277
And our English friend?

15:28.311 --> 15:29.978
Is our English friend

15:30.013 --> 15:31.947
causing any problems?

15:31.981 --> 15:33.549
We're keeping an eye on him.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.117
I'm sorry, Mr. Dreyfuss,

15:35.151 --> 15:36.652
but Tokyo's on the line.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.987
Mr. Mizuyama's people are calling again.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.023
Did you hurt yourself?

15:43.760 --> 15:45.227
Look at that.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.002
It's okay.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.938
It's only a paper cut.

15:55.972 --> 15:58.807
Of course, Mr. Dreyfuss.

16:01.077 --> 16:03.278
More deaths mean more questions.

16:03.313 --> 16:06.281
That's okay, Jobe.

16:06.316 --> 16:08.584
Everyone knows what a dangerous place.

16:08.618 --> 16:12.387
D.C. can be.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.705
Sorry, pal, I'm closed.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.374
Come back tomorrow morning.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.344
You hear me?

16:40.563 --> 16:43.163
I may not get this, and
I may not call you back.

16:43.187 --> 16:45.734
If that's not a deal-breaker,
leave me a message.

16:45.768 --> 16:47.536
Miss Jenny,

16:47.570 --> 16:49.988
'tis most heartening to hear your voice,

16:49.989 --> 16:53.158
even if merely an auditory reproduction.

16:53.192 --> 16:56.495
I trust your journeys to
parts unknown have borne fruit.

16:57.964 --> 16:59.798
Perhaps you have found
more answers than I

16:59.832 --> 17:01.633
as to the whereabouts
of the next Witness.

17:01.668 --> 17:04.469
I, too, have left the
confines of Sleepy Hollow,

17:04.503 --> 17:07.005
and... yet again,

17:07.040 --> 17:09.540
my eyes are opened to a plain fact.

17:11.544 --> 17:13.912
I'm out of my element.

17:13.945 --> 17:16.315
But I remain hopeful.

17:16.348 --> 17:17.848
I have found new allies.

17:17.884 --> 17:20.852
And though it is early...

17:20.887 --> 17:23.321
I have a good feeling.

17:24.991 --> 17:27.159
Although they may need to
work on their trust issues.

17:29.228 --> 17:31.663
The condition of the victim's
body was the same as Eric's,

17:31.698 --> 17:33.832
and he had a puncture wound
at the base of his skull.

17:33.866 --> 17:36.335
And this?

17:36.369 --> 17:39.137
Is the basis of our partnership
to be suspicion and doubt?

17:39.172 --> 17:41.640
This is not a partnership,
this is a temporary alliance.

17:41.674 --> 17:43.141
And you have a history of running.

17:43.176 --> 17:44.609
One instant, not a history.

17:45.645 --> 17:47.713
Out of two meetings, it is.

17:47.747 --> 17:49.981
That's a 50% fleeing ratio.

17:51.050 --> 17:52.651
"Fleeing ratio"?

17:54.320 --> 17:56.122
I'm concerned about
your fleeing grammar.

17:56.147 --> 17:56.871
Works for me.

17:56.872 --> 17:58.832
Probably very used to
having your way, aren't you?

18:02.962 --> 18:04.162
All your talk of demons

18:04.197 --> 18:05.931
and magic statues made me think of

18:05.965 --> 18:07.799
a resource we might tap.

18:07.834 --> 18:11.336
Sounds crazy, but apparently I
live in the world of crazy now.

18:11.371 --> 18:12.811
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's this?

18:12.835 --> 18:14.506
It's an archive where federal agencies

18:14.540 --> 18:16.975
send their reports of
unexplained phenomena.

18:17.009 --> 18:19.344
We call it "the Vault."

18:25.218 --> 18:27.352
This is dated 1789.

18:27.387 --> 18:29.587
"Captain Crane is to
lead this organization.

18:29.611 --> 18:31.256
"His sworn duty to stand guard

18:31.290 --> 18:35.594
against all threats
deemed otherworldly."

18:35.628 --> 18:37.729
This is Washington's agency.

18:38.898 --> 18:40.766
George Washington founded a group

18:40.800 --> 18:42.801
to battle the supernatural.

18:42.835 --> 18:44.970
It did survive.

18:45.004 --> 18:46.772
We must go there.

18:46.806 --> 18:47.873
Here, that.

18:47.907 --> 18:50.175
Because, if I'm correct,

18:50.209 --> 18:53.779
this Vault could provide
the answer to all our needs.

18:53.813 --> 18:55.580
The palace of knowledge.

18:55.615 --> 18:59.751
Conclave for the brightest and the best.

19:05.792 --> 19:07.426
Seems about right.

19:08.494 --> 19:11.596
Can I help you?

19:11.631 --> 19:12.931
Special Agent Diana Thomas.

19:12.965 --> 19:14.399
And this is...

19:14.434 --> 19:17.135
What has become of Washington's dream?

19:18.805 --> 19:20.071
You, there.

19:20.106 --> 19:22.274
Is this Agency 355,

19:22.308 --> 19:24.276
the last watchtower
against threats otherworldly

19:24.310 --> 19:26.077
and supernatural malevolence?

19:26.112 --> 19:29.915
I... want to say...

19:29.949 --> 19:31.316
yes.

19:32.685 --> 19:34.586
Wait a second.

19:34.620 --> 19:35.921
It's you.

19:35.955 --> 19:37.589
I mean, you're-you're you.

19:37.623 --> 19:38.924
You're Captain Brownbeard.

19:38.958 --> 19:40.258
I beg your pardon?

19:40.293 --> 19:41.693
Sorry, that's just what I call you.

19:41.717 --> 19:43.495
Sleepy Hollow, right? Big fan.

19:43.529 --> 19:46.598
My God, where did I put it?

19:46.632 --> 19:47.933
Here it is.

19:47.967 --> 19:50.969
See, I follow a lot of dark net sites

19:51.003 --> 19:52.804
that monitor so-called
supernatural activity

19:52.839 --> 19:54.139
across the country.

19:54.173 --> 19:57.142
And, see, Sleepy Hollow comes up a lot.

19:57.176 --> 19:59.311
And you peruse this data because...

19:59.345 --> 20:00.979
That's our job.

20:01.013 --> 20:03.982
Yeah. Catalog everything from
the fringes for our files.

20:04.016 --> 20:07.285
Your files?

20:07.320 --> 20:09.488
Let's go. This is a dead end.

20:09.522 --> 20:10.689
I'm sorry.

20:10.723 --> 20:12.524
Do you mind?

20:14.861 --> 20:16.161
Now, look here, Mr...

20:16.195 --> 20:17.162
Jake.

20:17.196 --> 20:19.731
Yeah, not "Mr. Jake," just Jake.

20:21.701 --> 20:23.235
Damn, not again.

20:24.203 --> 20:26.505
Alex!

20:26.539 --> 20:28.499
You said you weren't gonna
set things off anymore.

20:28.523 --> 20:30.208
I said I wouldn't set things off

20:30.243 --> 20:31.710
while you were in the room.

20:31.744 --> 20:32.911
You weren't in the room.

20:32.945 --> 20:34.412
Is that the microwave?

20:34.447 --> 20:36.367
Yeah, I wanted to see how
that new Mayan artifact

20:36.391 --> 20:38.316
would react to non-ionizing radiation.

20:38.351 --> 20:39.851
Turns out, not well.

20:43.022 --> 20:44.389
Who's the Gawker?

20:44.423 --> 20:46.057
What is this?

20:46.092 --> 20:48.894
These are our files.

20:48.928 --> 20:51.730
Most folks just think
we're this weird library.

20:51.764 --> 20:53.231
Yo, there's cool stuff here.

20:53.266 --> 20:55.934
You know, if you... buy
into that sort of thing.

20:55.968 --> 20:58.603
You know, which... of course, I don't.

20:58.638 --> 20:59.471
I do.

20:59.505 --> 21:00.672
I do, too.

21:00.706 --> 21:02.173
And it's just the two of you?

21:02.208 --> 21:03.675
Yeah, I do news and information.

21:03.709 --> 21:06.344
Alex does artifacts and machines.

21:06.379 --> 21:08.880
Here.

21:08.915 --> 21:10.181
Washington's seal.

21:10.216 --> 21:12.384
Yeah, those are our official logs.

21:15.187 --> 21:18.790
These have been typeset
with an English common press.

21:18.824 --> 21:21.426
Something odd about the mortise.

21:28.434 --> 21:30.335
Of course.

21:30.369 --> 21:34.172
There is a text hidden
beneath this text.

21:34.206 --> 21:36.308
Written in Benjamin Franklin's code.

21:36.342 --> 21:39.578
I learned to decipher
such hidden messages

21:39.612 --> 21:43.615
when I apprenticed as
Franklin's typesetter.

21:46.452 --> 21:48.086
Of course, I mean when I learned

21:48.120 --> 21:50.455
what it was to be Franklin's typesetter.

21:52.525 --> 21:55.427
Who are these guys?

21:55.461 --> 21:57.796
There is 200 years of
information in here.

21:57.830 --> 22:00.599
Make no mistake, this...

22:00.633 --> 22:04.035
is the secret history of America.

22:05.444 --> 22:08.068
Those who ignore history

22:08.069 --> 22:10.584
are doomed to...

22:11.084 --> 22:13.986
die by its bloody,

22:14.020 --> 22:16.221
hideous claws.

22:16.256 --> 22:18.223
I don't think that's
how the saying goes.

22:18.258 --> 22:19.725
Here, here.

22:19.759 --> 22:24.296
The killer we seek 'tis a
creature summoned in 1865

22:24.330 --> 22:28.066
by a Confederate occultist named Booth.

22:28.101 --> 22:31.436
He raised the beast to
kill our country's leader

22:31.471 --> 22:33.438
during a period of
deep national turmoil.

22:33.473 --> 22:34.673
I'm sorry.

22:34.707 --> 22:37.309
1865? Booth?

22:37.343 --> 22:39.278
You don't mean John Wilkes Booth?

22:39.312 --> 22:41.013
The very same.

22:41.047 --> 22:43.115
- Which means...
- Don't say it.

22:43.149 --> 22:45.684
President Abraham Lincoln
was killed by a demon.

22:45.718 --> 22:46.685
You said it.

22:46.719 --> 22:48.120
Whoa.

22:48.154 --> 22:49.922
Seriously, who are these guys?

22:49.956 --> 22:51.323
The thing that killed Eric

22:51.357 --> 22:52.858
also killed Abraham Lincoln?

22:52.892 --> 22:55.727
So it would seem. Here.

22:55.762 --> 22:58.063
"In the waning days of the Civil War,"

22:58.097 --> 23:01.400
"the Confederacy allied
with the powers of darkness."

23:01.434 --> 23:02.901
"John Wilkes Booth,"

23:02.936 --> 23:04.736
"the South's strongest occultist,"

23:04.771 --> 23:07.906
"made several attempts
on Lincoln's life."

23:07.941 --> 23:09.975
"In a last-ditch attempt,."

23:10.009 --> 23:12.344
"Booth enacted a desperate ritual."

23:24.857 --> 23:28.093
"He summoned a demon
directly into his own body."

23:33.766 --> 23:37.169
"Lincoln was protected by his
own supernatural experts..."

23:39.105 --> 23:42.074
"led by his wife,."

23:42.108 --> 23:43.642
"Mary Todd Lincoln."

23:43.676 --> 23:47.679
"Booth knew the only way to get
to Lincoln was to adopt a form"

23:47.714 --> 23:49.714
"that would allow him to
defeat Mary's safeguards."

24:28.021 --> 24:30.222
"Mary tracked the demon to a farmhouse,

24:30.256 --> 24:33.191
"where she managed to seal
it in an underground chamber.

24:34.627 --> 24:37.396
"Years later, members
of this very agency

24:37.430 --> 24:40.565
"reinforced her mystic barriers by

24:40.600 --> 24:44.970
constructing a protective
totem on the selfsame spot."

24:45.004 --> 24:46.104
The Lincoln Memorial.

24:46.139 --> 24:47.306
Wait, you're saying

24:47.340 --> 24:49.241
someone decapitated the Lincoln Memorial

24:49.275 --> 24:50.642
to release this demon?

24:50.677 --> 24:53.178
That statue is made of
white Georgian marble.

24:53.212 --> 24:55.013
You need Primacord
to blast the head off,

24:55.048 --> 24:56.682
but there were no signs of explosives.

24:56.716 --> 24:59.184
The head must have been
removed by supernatural means.

24:59.218 --> 25:01.386
A focused hex on the weakest point,

25:01.421 --> 25:03.689
the neck.

25:03.723 --> 25:06.892
Sure know a lot about decapitation.

25:06.926 --> 25:10.195
I've had some experience in the matter.

25:10.229 --> 25:11.863
Can you believe this?

25:11.898 --> 25:12.864
It's real.

25:12.899 --> 25:15.233
Like, everything in here,

25:15.268 --> 25:17.369
it's realer than real.

25:17.403 --> 25:19.538
Like, all of this, it matters.

25:19.572 --> 25:22.240
I'm not really sure what I believe yet.

25:22.275 --> 25:24.776
I must examine the demon's cell.

25:24.811 --> 25:27.011
It's not gonna work; The
whole memorial's a crime scene.

25:27.035 --> 25:28.914
We glimpsed a containment chamber,

25:28.948 --> 25:29.948
subterranean.

25:29.982 --> 25:31.750
There must be a way to access it.

25:31.784 --> 25:33.752
We got to show them.

25:33.786 --> 25:35.787
- No, no.
- What?

25:37.523 --> 25:38.657
What?

25:47.133 --> 25:48.800
These passageways were

25:48.835 --> 25:51.903
supposedly built right
after the Revolutionary War.

25:51.938 --> 25:54.039
Now we just use them to get in and out

25:54.073 --> 25:55.513
when we don't want security to know.

25:55.537 --> 25:58.243
Why wouldn't you want security to know?

25:58.277 --> 26:01.780
Sometimes I bring things in
that are a teensy bit dangerous.

26:01.814 --> 26:04.349
Splendid. This'll do.

26:05.618 --> 26:07.119
Stay here.

26:14.293 --> 26:16.261
I cannot believe this is what I'm doing.

26:16.295 --> 26:19.431
Crawling through tunnels
with Mr. Downton Abbey.

26:19.465 --> 26:20.632
No offense.

26:20.666 --> 26:21.633
None taken.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.135
I rather like Downton Abbey.

26:24.971 --> 26:26.972
Believe it or not, I know how you feel.

26:27.006 --> 26:29.307
Being thrust into a world
you never knew existed

26:29.342 --> 26:32.377
can be... unnerving.

26:32.412 --> 26:34.212
I was recently reminded

26:34.247 --> 26:37.582
I don't do well with change.

26:37.617 --> 26:39.785
Well, I find it helps...

26:39.819 --> 26:41.987
to know you're not
going through it alone.

26:42.021 --> 26:43.455
Your partner?

26:43.489 --> 26:45.424
Yes.

26:47.460 --> 26:50.362
She helped me find my feet,
even as she was finding hers.

26:52.265 --> 26:54.299
She was the best.

26:56.302 --> 26:58.603
I met Eric in the Corps.

26:58.638 --> 27:00.772
We went through a lot as well.

27:00.807 --> 27:01.807
You were in the military?

27:01.831 --> 27:04.443
Marines. Two tours.

27:04.477 --> 27:07.345
Afterward, Eric wrote my recommendations

27:07.380 --> 27:08.780
when I applied for Homeland.

27:08.815 --> 27:10.215
Sounds like a good man.

27:10.249 --> 27:12.284
The best.

27:12.318 --> 27:14.286
Why did you leave the military?

27:14.320 --> 27:15.887
I had a baby.

27:15.922 --> 27:17.022
Molly.

27:17.056 --> 27:18.957
She's ten now.

27:18.991 --> 27:20.892
- A fine age.
- Yeah.

27:20.927 --> 27:23.361
Smart as a whip.

27:23.396 --> 27:26.064
Troublemaker, too.

27:26.098 --> 27:30.035
Though these days, the
trouble's not really her fault.

27:30.069 --> 27:31.102
Is she in danger?

27:31.137 --> 27:34.372
No, nothing like that.

27:34.407 --> 27:37.075
She just...

27:37.109 --> 27:40.579
she stopped talking.

27:40.613 --> 27:42.581
She fainted a few weeks ago at school.

27:42.615 --> 27:43.782
She was fine afterward.

27:43.816 --> 27:45.784
Doctor said there's
nothing wrong with her.

27:45.818 --> 27:49.588
Transient aphasia, they say.

27:49.622 --> 27:52.524
It'll pass, they say.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.328
So I will see your new world

27:56.362 --> 27:59.030
and raise you a child you cannot help.

28:01.534 --> 28:04.536
'Cause there is nothing
scarier than that.

28:07.039 --> 28:08.707
Perhaps we should...

28:15.748 --> 28:17.115
Here.

28:21.087 --> 28:23.722
Look.

28:23.756 --> 28:25.457
This is psychotic behavior.

28:29.295 --> 28:31.930
Wait, wait, wait.

28:31.964 --> 28:33.431
The man who was killed...

28:33.466 --> 28:36.568
he had a prominent Stars and
Stripes display, had he not?

28:36.602 --> 28:37.602
Yes.

28:38.604 --> 28:40.772
You don't think the
American flag is a trigger?

28:40.806 --> 28:43.074
To the demon, 'tis
more than merely a flag.

28:43.109 --> 28:46.144
It was summoned to
destroy the Union cause,

28:46.178 --> 28:48.046
and it has had 150 years

28:48.080 --> 28:49.948
to do nothing but fixate on its mission.

28:51.017 --> 28:52.651
What we know as the American flag

28:52.685 --> 28:55.587
represents the focal
point of its hatred.

28:55.621 --> 28:57.689
This is not good.

29:00.192 --> 29:02.427
Agent Thomas, what is it?

29:12.071 --> 29:14.573
"Freedom Concert, Saturday.

29:14.607 --> 29:18.009
"Show your patriotism by wearing...

29:18.044 --> 29:19.778
the Stars and Stripes."

29:19.812 --> 29:21.972
Thousands of people are gonna
be out in public tomorrow

29:21.996 --> 29:23.782
wearing red, white and blue.

29:23.816 --> 29:25.750
They're gonna be giant
targets for this thing.

29:25.785 --> 29:28.453
It's going to be a massacre.

29:29.032 --> 29:30.949
Nothing around the cell suggested a way

29:30.950 --> 29:33.251
to defeat the beast...
no protective amulets,

29:33.285 --> 29:35.487
no mystical wards.

29:35.521 --> 29:37.322
Simply a metal box.

29:37.356 --> 29:39.891
Yeah, well, can't we get
them to cancel the concert?

29:39.925 --> 29:40.825
Can I be there

29:40.860 --> 29:42.060
when you tell people that

29:42.094 --> 29:43.495
a demonic John Wilkes Booth

29:43.529 --> 29:45.830
is seeing gang colors
in red, white and blue?

29:45.865 --> 29:48.666
And it would be a
temporary measure, at best.

29:48.701 --> 29:51.870
Perhaps there's more to be
gleaned from these texts.

29:53.973 --> 29:55.340
The walls of the cell

29:55.374 --> 29:56.674
were oxidized green,

29:56.709 --> 29:57.869
which means it was made of...

29:57.893 --> 29:59.611
Copper.

29:59.645 --> 30:02.614
Which is a poor material
to build a prison;

30:02.648 --> 30:05.350
It's too weak, too pliable.

30:05.384 --> 30:07.519
There must have been
another reason they used it.

30:08.787 --> 30:11.256
Because copper is
the demon's kryptonite.

30:11.290 --> 30:14.893
Or... because copper
is the demon's weakness.

30:15.770 --> 30:18.296
- Agent Thom...
- It's the same meaning.

30:18.330 --> 30:20.265
Yeah, for Superman.

30:20.299 --> 30:21.833
Agent Thomas, very well done.

30:21.867 --> 30:24.169
We need to build some
weapons out of this material.

30:24.203 --> 30:27.438
Perhaps a pike or some crossbow bolts.

30:27.473 --> 30:29.440
I think I can come up
with something better.

30:29.475 --> 30:31.943
I don't know if I buy
into all this demon talk.

30:31.977 --> 30:34.212
But if you're saying I
get to do some cool builds

30:34.246 --> 30:37.615
and try out some of the,
weird artifacts in here,

30:37.650 --> 30:40.552
well, I'm down with that.

30:41.654 --> 30:43.521
Now,

30:43.556 --> 30:46.324
someone get me a whole mess of pennies.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.336
Crowd's being funneled
in this direction,

30:58.370 --> 30:59.637
through the security checks.

31:00.806 --> 31:02.473
Look at this dude.

31:02.508 --> 31:04.008
What you got there?

31:04.043 --> 31:05.109
Frock coat

31:05.144 --> 31:07.145
with standing collar,
leather shank buttons,

31:07.179 --> 31:08.513
Revere boots?

31:08.547 --> 31:10.248
A little out of style, don't you think?

31:10.282 --> 31:11.282
I beg your pardon?

31:11.317 --> 31:12.650
That look is so 2000s.

31:12.685 --> 31:14.185
We rocked it for a while,

31:14.220 --> 31:16.621
but everything's about
Hamilton these days.

31:16.655 --> 31:17.789
Hamilton...

31:17.823 --> 31:19.157
There were other people involved

31:19.191 --> 31:20.692
in the American Revolution, you know!

31:25.030 --> 31:27.632
Not a fan of musicals.

31:27.666 --> 31:29.334
Really?

31:32.838 --> 31:33.838
Agent?

31:37.977 --> 31:38.977
There!

31:41.880 --> 31:44.882
Time to unfurl the matador's cape.

31:49.288 --> 31:51.889
Ready?

31:57.096 --> 31:58.396
Crane's on his way to you.

32:01.667 --> 32:02.734
And he's singing.

32:05.253 --> 32:06.471
You guys ready?

32:06.505 --> 32:07.972
All right, we're getting set up now.

32:08.007 --> 32:09.140
All right, they're coming.

32:09.174 --> 32:11.109
All right. We're almost there.

32:11.143 --> 32:12.644
Just got to lock down this mount.

32:12.678 --> 32:14.679
Will you pass me the ammo?

32:14.713 --> 32:17.582
These are literally magic bullets.

32:17.616 --> 32:21.352
Yeah. If you believe that book
you copied those symbols from.

32:21.387 --> 32:23.354
Mystical Metallurgy?

32:23.389 --> 32:25.290
Yeah, I've looked at
that text a dozen times,

32:25.324 --> 32:27.225
but now it's a whole new resource.

32:28.794 --> 32:32.196
You got to admit that this
is weird, even for you.

32:32.231 --> 32:34.365
Look, all I know is, my whole life,

32:34.400 --> 32:36.868
I believed there was something
bigger out there, okay?

32:36.902 --> 32:39.037
Something beyond what everyone knew.

32:39.071 --> 32:40.872
And now I find out it's all true.

32:40.906 --> 32:43.041
Do you know what I believe in?

32:43.075 --> 32:44.809
Things that you can touch.

32:44.843 --> 32:46.210
Things that you can take apart

32:46.245 --> 32:47.979
and then put back together again.

32:48.013 --> 32:52.417
It's a big world, Alex, and it
just got a little bit bigger.

32:52.451 --> 32:54.218
Remind me to punch you even harder

32:54.253 --> 32:55.787
than I usually do, please.

32:55.821 --> 32:58.089
We need to get inside.

33:14.773 --> 33:16.941
Allow me.

33:38.997 --> 33:40.832
Where has he gone?

34:12.864 --> 34:14.132
Hey!

34:16.034 --> 34:18.835
You are the best-dressed
demon I've ever seen.

34:28.112 --> 34:29.981
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:33.351 --> 34:34.518
You all right?

34:35.554 --> 34:36.654
What happened?

34:36.688 --> 34:37.722
Um...

34:38.623 --> 34:40.024
Allow me to introduce.

34:40.058 --> 34:41.659
Miss Jenny Mills,

34:41.693 --> 34:45.862
soldier, scholar, gentlewoman and...

34:45.898 --> 34:47.864
all-around badass?

34:50.636 --> 34:52.969
Actually, I prefer "Miss Badass."

35:00.588 --> 35:01.878
They seem like a good group.

35:02.420 --> 35:06.606
Indeed. They're most intrepid
in the face of the unknown.

35:08.675 --> 35:10.710
I'm sorry I couldn't come earlier.

35:10.744 --> 35:13.413
Cell service in the Himalayas is spotty.

35:15.382 --> 35:19.118
Tell me, were your travels productive?

35:19.153 --> 35:21.754
Yeah. I had some really good yak cheese.

35:23.257 --> 35:26.225
And I learned a lot
about Tibetan concepts

35:26.260 --> 35:28.227
of soul migration.

35:28.262 --> 35:30.430
But as far as tracking
the next Witness...

35:33.934 --> 35:36.602
She's really gone, isn't she?

35:39.440 --> 35:42.442
Yes, I'm afraid she is.

35:46.647 --> 35:48.648
If a new Witness is out there,

35:48.682 --> 35:52.418
you two will find each
other sooner or later.

35:52.453 --> 35:54.687
In fact, there's a chance
that you already have

35:54.721 --> 35:56.622
and don't know it.

35:56.657 --> 35:59.325
Have you run into anyone
that's shown potential?

36:00.461 --> 36:02.095
Possibly.

36:02.129 --> 36:04.330
Far too soon to tell.

36:06.800 --> 36:10.937
Everything here is just so...

36:10.971 --> 36:12.872
new.

36:14.541 --> 36:17.977
Crane, you need to know something.

36:18.011 --> 36:21.114
You're not alone. You never will be.

36:21.148 --> 36:23.783
Take a look at where we are.

36:23.817 --> 36:27.520
That building is here because of you.

36:27.554 --> 36:30.223
This whole country is
here because of you.

36:30.257 --> 36:34.093
You belong more than anyone I know.

36:37.931 --> 36:41.901
In the old world, it was
common to personify countries

36:41.935 --> 36:43.536
with ancient goddesses.

36:43.570 --> 36:47.306
So you had Britannia,
Caledonia, Germania.

36:47.341 --> 36:50.776
But in America, no such figures existed.

36:50.811 --> 36:51.911
So...

36:51.945 --> 36:55.781
colonists invented the personification

36:55.816 --> 36:57.583
of liberty,

36:57.618 --> 36:59.852
and they named her Columbia.

37:01.355 --> 37:04.657
That is who this city is named after.

37:04.691 --> 37:08.194
Washington, District of Columbia.

37:08.228 --> 37:10.196
Welcome home, Crane.

37:15.235 --> 37:17.235
And shocking news out of Tokyo.

37:17.259 --> 37:20.373
Hiroshi Mizuyama, chairman
of Mizuyama Technologies,

37:20.407 --> 37:22.175
was killed while on a corporate retreat.

37:22.209 --> 37:24.110
According to a spokesman,

37:24.144 --> 37:26.946
some kind of wild animal
attack is suspected,

37:26.980 --> 37:29.015
though details are sketchy.

37:29.049 --> 37:31.284
Mizuyama had been the lone
holdout of the company's

37:31.318 --> 37:34.120
senior management
regarding a possible sale

37:34.154 --> 37:35.488
to Dreyfuss Enterprises,

37:35.522 --> 37:37.056
which is now expected to go through.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.191
Hey!

37:38.225 --> 37:39.959
Mr. Dreyfuss.

37:39.993 --> 37:41.394
Hi. How was Tokyo?

37:41.428 --> 37:43.362
You go to that sushi
place I told you about?

37:43.397 --> 37:44.397
Didn't have time.

37:44.431 --> 37:46.799
What a shame. Well, next time.

37:46.833 --> 37:50.736
And, by the way...

37:50.771 --> 37:52.939
sensational work, my friend.

37:56.109 --> 37:58.010
Crane disposed of the Entity.

37:58.045 --> 38:00.513
Fine. The demon was
never the point anyway.

38:00.547 --> 38:03.182
It was just an entertaining
side-effect of breaking that

38:03.217 --> 38:05.685
protective... spell.

38:05.719 --> 38:07.687
We're still keeping tabs on Crane.

38:07.721 --> 38:08.921
Good. Good, good, good.

38:08.956 --> 38:10.489
We're gonna need him back soon.

38:10.524 --> 38:11.924
Shouldn't we just grab him now?

38:11.959 --> 38:13.859
Now?

38:13.894 --> 38:15.628
It's not quite time.

38:15.662 --> 38:19.498
And time is the most
important resource of all,

38:19.533 --> 38:23.970
because time is the
one thing you can't buy.

38:24.004 --> 38:26.973
Anything else can be had

38:27.007 --> 38:30.009
if you're willing to put in the work.

38:35.983 --> 38:38.050
Anything.

38:45.559 --> 38:49.562
I finished the ceremony
while you were away.

38:49.596 --> 38:52.798
The prize is ready to be extracted.

39:14.488 --> 39:16.856
Was it worth all the trouble?

39:16.890 --> 39:18.024
All the spilt blood?

39:18.058 --> 39:21.961
There really is no amount of blood

39:21.995 --> 39:25.164
that I won't spill...

39:25.198 --> 39:27.500
to get the rest of these.

39:28.902 --> 39:32.305
So you're gonna stay here in D.C.?

39:32.339 --> 39:33.973
I still need to find the men

39:34.007 --> 39:36.008
who abducted me and brought me here.

39:38.178 --> 39:41.681
And on a personal note...

39:43.850 --> 39:46.485
I feel it is time for a fresh start.

39:46.520 --> 39:49.355
You seem like a person who has trouble

39:49.389 --> 39:51.223
leaving the past behind them.

39:52.893 --> 39:56.195
Could be the historical
consultant thing.

39:56.229 --> 39:59.198
Well, the past is
important. Gives us context.

39:59.232 --> 40:01.500
I am my history.

40:03.904 --> 40:07.540
But this fellow back
here, Thomas Jefferson,

40:07.574 --> 40:09.909
once said something
that I think of often.

40:09.943 --> 40:12.378
He said, "I like"

40:12.412 --> 40:14.180
"the dreams of the future

40:14.214 --> 40:17.783
better than the histories of the past."

40:20.287 --> 40:24.223
Until you find these
people who kidnapped you,

40:24.257 --> 40:26.926
more demons are coming, aren't they?

40:26.960 --> 40:30.329
I just, I get a sense
that's part of the deal.

40:30.364 --> 40:32.331
It does not have to be your deal.

40:32.366 --> 40:35.401
You have a child.
This is not your fight.

40:35.435 --> 40:39.372
Like you said, ours is
a temporary partnership.

40:39.406 --> 40:42.441
I have to find the people
who are behind Eric's death.

40:42.476 --> 40:43.776
I owe him that.

40:43.810 --> 40:46.879
Agent Thomas...

40:46.913 --> 40:49.348
once you start down this path...

40:51.318 --> 40:53.486
there really is no turning back.

40:58.759 --> 41:01.927
It helps if you don't
have to do it alone.

41:05.031 --> 41:07.500
Besides...

41:07.534 --> 41:09.668
I overheard Alex and Jake.

41:09.703 --> 41:11.036
She's building a guillotine.

41:11.071 --> 41:13.672
She's gonna use him to test it.

41:13.707 --> 41:15.408
Better keep an eye on those two.

41:15.442 --> 41:18.611
Yes. I think that would be wise.

41:24.351 --> 41:26.419
Molly, I'm home.

41:30.690 --> 41:31.891
Hey, Moo.

41:31.925 --> 41:34.293
How are you?

41:37.731 --> 41:40.666
Clara told me soccer practice went well.

41:40.700 --> 41:42.768
So you'll probably be
starting this weekend.

41:50.510 --> 41:52.845
I met some new people today at work.

41:54.881 --> 41:56.782
Complete weirdoes,

41:56.817 --> 41:59.518
which means you'll probably like them.

42:09.529 --> 42:11.063
All right.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.234
Dinner's almost ready, okay?
