gigantic hole in the floor.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.805

I put tape on the cracks

Did you just
whisper something?

- And being someone

I was hesitant at first

15:52.819 --> 15:54.685

about it,

15:54.720 --> 15:57.721

16:55.114 --> 16:56.747
<i>[dramatic musical sting]</i>

16:56.782 --> 16:58.849

- Danielle?

17:10.363 --> 17:11.829
- I was pretty freaked out.

17:15.401 --> 17:17.401
[faucet sprays]
- Ah!

17:17.436 --> 17:19.837
- Suddenly, I was hit
with a jolt of

17:23.242 --> 17:26.410
I had to physically
turn the water back off.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.612
- [breathing heavily]

18:20.766 --> 18:23.067
- Look, there's something wrong
with that guesthouse.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.270
- So I told Danielle
everything.

18:26.305 --> 18:29.440
- Maybe you've just been
working too much.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.609

18:31.644 --> 18:33.844
<i>She'll do 12-hour days,</i>

18:33.879 --> 18:36.814
and when she comes home,
she's drawing for her next day.

18:36.849 --> 18:41.085
- Look, I'm gonna go stay
with my mom for a few weeks.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.953
- Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.588
Take as much time

18:44.624 --> 18:47.057

18:47.093 --> 18:48.759
and just clear my head

18:48.794 --> 18:51.262
and get out of the environment
for a little bit.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.264

19:07.280 --> 19:08.312

<i>currently in a band,</i>
<i>Stone Sour.</i>

19:12.985 --> 19:15.119
<i>- Danielle's done</i>
<i>a lot of my tattoos.</i>

19:15.154 --> 19:18.022
Actually, she's done
this whole entire arm.

19:18.057 --> 19:20.557
It took about, uh,
five years,

19:20.593 --> 19:22.026
something like that,
on and off.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.027
She's amazing.

an earthquake tremor.

[thud!]

21:47.873 --> 21:50.340

Another shove.

was not an earthquake.

a little more polish.

22:14.234 --> 22:15.500
Maybe a new roof.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.201
- Yeah.

22:17.237 --> 22:19.237
It's coming together.

22:19.272 --> 22:20.738
- You sleep well?

22:24.477 --> 22:28.379
- Roy's face
was kind of shocked.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.181
- Can I get some coffee?

22:30.216 --> 22:31.883
<i>- Roy's definitely</i>
<i>not easily shaken.</i>

22:31.918 --> 22:33.685
<i>Being on stage,</i>

<i>you have that</i>
<i>kind of confidence, you know.</i>

22:35.855 --> 22:38.489
And he looked like
a man that

22:38.525 --> 22:41.325
had seen something
or felt something.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.795
<i>- There was no other</i>
<i>logical explanation.</i>

22:45.865 --> 22:49.233
- I knew it was definitely
supernatural...experience.

so scared in my life.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.572
<i>[eerie music]</i>

22:54.607 --> 22:56.441

23:00.080 --> 23:01.746
- Hey, uh...

23:01.781 --> 23:03.381
Hey, Roy, Roy--

<i>- I wanted friends and family</i>
<i>to be able to stay with me...</i>

<i>across the window.</i>

23:40.653 --> 23:44.956
That's strange because...
nobody's in there.

23:47.327 --> 23:50.094
- Greg?

23:52.365 --> 23:55.099
<i>- So I thought,</i>
<i>in my head,</i>

23:55.135 --> 23:58.770
maybe somebody had strayed
onto my property.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.781
<i>And I felt like</i>
<i>I was gonna vomit.</i>

25:24.290 --> 25:28.159
As soon as I ran out of

25:28.194 --> 25:31.996
<i>I have never experienced</i>
<i>anything like this before,</i>

25:32.031 --> 25:33.664

I just needed a break.

<i>- I had decided that</i>

29:13.685 --> 29:15.218
I'm sorry.

29:16.855 --> 29:18.655
Hana and I
are like sisters,

29:18.690 --> 29:20.857
and I was really
worried about her.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.193

We were put in touch with him

29:56.929 --> 29:59.696

30:03.502 --> 30:05.569
<i>Even though I'm a psychic,</i>

30:05.604 --> 30:07.537

<i>- I really didn't know</i>

30:16.648 --> 30:20.884

30:23.822 --> 30:26.389
- Actually, no, not at all.

30:26.425 --> 30:27.891

I just didn't know that it had
