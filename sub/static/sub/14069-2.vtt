00:00.030 --> 00:01.225
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.226 --> 00:03.367
- Robert Zane made you an offer.
- He did.

00:03.368 --> 00:05.067
You begged me
for a second chance.

00:05.664 --> 00:08.631
And now he's using you
to destroy us.

00:08.667 --> 00:10.333
You waltzed in here thinking
this was gonna be

00:10.368 --> 00:12.502
like some prison movie,
but it's not.

00:12.537 --> 00:14.437
It's just prison.
Welcome to Danbury.

00:14.472 --> 00:16.706
- Mike Ross.
- Frank Gallo.

00:16.741 --> 00:20.109
We're being sued for every
case Mike Ross has ever touched.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.945
You won't admit this whole
thing is your fault

00:21.980 --> 00:23.646
in the first place.
My fault?

00:23.682 --> 00:26.316
If I hadn't brought Mike in,
you'd still be here

00:26.351 --> 00:28.618
sniveling around like
a Goddamn junior partner.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.586
Your fiancé,
you want to call her?

00:30.622 --> 00:33.523
Maybe I'll just send
Rachel a text.

00:33.558 --> 00:35.224
We need to move the money
that we have

00:35.260 --> 00:36.392
in every account
by tomorrow.

00:36.428 --> 00:37.493
We don't need to move it.

00:37.529 --> 00:38.628
We can use their buy-ins

00:38.663 --> 00:39.929
to settle
the class-action lawsuits.

00:39.965 --> 00:41.664
All right, let's go.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.132
I'm in the right cell.
I'm in the one you gave me.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.435
Yeah, but this isn't
the one they gave me.

00:45.470 --> 00:47.470
You said you could've turned
on a guy to get out of here,

00:47.505 --> 00:49.906
but you didn't
because you owe him.

00:49.941 --> 00:51.908
Well, I owe that
son of a bitch too.

00:51.943 --> 00:53.977
- You son of a bitch.
- Take it easy, Mike.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.445
And remember,
I know about you.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.113
And I got your
little girlfriend's number

00:57.148 --> 00:59.082
right here.

01:06.490 --> 01:07.989
<i>You keep watching</i>
<i>that clock,</i>

01:08.024 --> 01:10.225
<i>it's gonna be</i>
<i>a long two years.</i>

01:10.260 --> 01:12.527
Believe it or not, I've been
where you are right now.

01:12.562 --> 01:13.828
You've been thinking about
how to get back

01:13.864 --> 01:15.196
at that son of a bitch
all night.

01:15.232 --> 01:16.464
Spit in his oatmeal.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.600
Shit on his pillow.

01:18.635 --> 01:20.935
Whatever it is, my advice
to you is don't do it.

01:20.971 --> 01:22.904
I don't need any advice
from you.

01:22.939 --> 01:24.572
- Excuse me?
- You're the one

01:24.608 --> 01:28.977
that left me alone with that
psychopath in the first place.

01:29.012 --> 01:30.111
Now I get
why you haven't

01:30.146 --> 01:31.579
said a word to me
since last night.

01:31.615 --> 01:32.780
How the hell did you
think I'd react

01:32.816 --> 01:34.249
after something like that?
Hey, listen, man.

01:34.284 --> 01:35.783
I don't have anything
against you,

01:35.819 --> 01:38.486
but I sure as hell
don't have anything for you.

01:38.522 --> 01:40.388
And I'm not gonna cause trouble
with a guy like that

01:40.423 --> 01:42.724
for someone I've never even met,
so if he wants me

01:42.759 --> 01:45.093
to switch for a few hours,
I'm switching.

01:45.128 --> 01:46.995
To hell with
what happens to me, right?

01:47.030 --> 01:49.297
- Hey, I didn't say that.
- No, you just did it.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.133 --> 02:14.299
Donna, what are you
doing here?

02:14.335 --> 02:16.068
I come bearing gifts.

02:16.104 --> 02:18.771
That's really nice, but you
don't have to come over here

02:18.806 --> 02:20.206
to check on me.
I'm fine.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.375
Says the girl
in her fiancé's shirt.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.010
Look, I know it's cheesy.

02:25.046 --> 02:26.278
Rachel, you wanted to feel him
next to you.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.947
It's not cheesy.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.748
Thanks, Donna.

02:29.784 --> 02:30.850
Well, you do owe me
a thank you,

02:30.885 --> 02:32.084
but it's not for that.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.486
Because in a couple of hours
it's going to be more

02:33.521 --> 02:36.722
than his shirt
wrapped around you.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.858
Are you saying that you got me
on the visitor's list,

02:38.893 --> 02:40.759
because they said
that if I'm not family--

02:40.795 --> 02:42.695
I don't care what they said.
You're his family.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.063
And you're my family, and I
wasn't going to sleep last night

02:45.099 --> 02:48.167
until I got you
on that list.

02:48.202 --> 02:51.704
I-I don't know
what to say.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.373
Say, "Thank you, Donna,"
and get your ass up there.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.781
What you got in your hand
there, tiger?

03:02.817 --> 03:05.451
Dark roast, splash of cream,
no sugar.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.952
And to what do I owe
the honor?

03:06.988 --> 03:08.554
I was thinking this morning
about the day

03:08.589 --> 03:09.788
you picked me
out of the mailroom

03:09.824 --> 03:11.857
and how far we've come.
You know, it's funny.

03:11.892 --> 03:15.094
I was thinking this morning
about how far we've fallen.

03:15.129 --> 03:17.229
Then let's go put
these lawsuits to bed.

03:36.851 --> 03:38.917
Excuse me, Officer?

03:38.953 --> 03:40.753
I know the phones don't open
until 10:00,

03:40.788 --> 03:42.054
but I was wondering
if it's possible for me

03:42.089 --> 03:43.155
to make a phone call?

03:43.190 --> 03:44.390
Get back in line
and eat your breakfast.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.858
Please.
The only reason I'm asking

03:45.893 --> 03:47.092
is 'cause it's an emergency.
I just need a little--

03:47.128 --> 03:49.028
What, are you on fire?

03:49.063 --> 03:50.896
Your leg broken?

03:50.931 --> 03:52.231
'Cause it looks to me
like you're trying to call

03:52.266 --> 03:53.666
someone out there about
something that happened in here.

03:53.701 --> 03:54.833
You don't understand,
all right, my fiancé is--

03:54.869 --> 03:56.535
No, you don't understand.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.037
Unless there's a bomb
headed for us,

03:58.072 --> 04:00.272
nothing that happens out there
has anything to do

04:00.308 --> 04:02.641
with what happens in here.
You got that?

04:02.677 --> 04:05.044
Yeah, got it.

04:11.451 --> 04:14.186
Hey, I left in such
a hurry last night,

04:14.221 --> 04:15.754
didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.088
Well, I'll say it now.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.423
Have a nice life.
Leave me alone.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.892
Don't you want to see
a copy of the pictures

04:20.928 --> 04:22.861
your fiancé sent me
last night?

04:25.199 --> 04:27.766
That's bullshit.
She didn't send you anything.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.467
You're right, she didn't.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.136
She sent 'em to you.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.571
I mean, you're the one
who started it all,

04:32.606 --> 04:34.372
telling her how much
you missed her.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.841
How hard do you think it was
for me to get her

04:35.876 --> 04:38.276
to send a sexy picture to you
after that?

04:38.312 --> 04:41.680
I think that kids today
call it a selfie.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.884
There's no way she sent you
a picture like that.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.186
You're right,
it wasn't sexy.

04:48.222 --> 04:50.956
But what I did,
I photoshopped her face

04:50.991 --> 04:52.591
onto a body that is.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.059
I did such a good job,

04:54.094 --> 04:56.595
no one in here
is ever gonna notice.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.130
Yeah.
I made copies.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.799
One for each guy
in the joint.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.768
Usually, a situation like this,
I would charge a fortune.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.704
But today,
I'm feeling so generous

05:05.739 --> 05:07.405
I'm going to give them away
for free.

05:14.915 --> 05:18.216
Get off him, Gallo!

05:18.252 --> 05:20.852
What? I didn't do shit!
He attacked me!

05:20.888 --> 05:21.920
That is bullshit!

05:21.955 --> 05:23.521
I tried to tell you
that's the guy.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.723
I don't care
what you tried to do.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.358
You wanted an emergency,
now you got it.

05:26.393 --> 05:28.627
Get 'em both out of here.

06:08.653 --> 06:10.653
Good morning, Ms. Pearson,
Mr. Specter,

06:10.789 --> 06:12.589
can I offer either of you
a hot towel?

06:12.624 --> 06:14.857
Miss, would you mind
telling me who hired you?

06:14.893 --> 06:17.527
I think we both know
who hired her.

06:24.736 --> 06:25.935
What the hell are you doing?

06:26.515 --> 06:28.481
- I'm making copies.
- Goddamn it.

06:28.517 --> 06:30.316
We don't bill you out
at 350 an hour to make copies.

06:30.352 --> 06:33.586
Now get your ass
back to work.

06:33.622 --> 06:35.288
That motion
isn't going to file itself.

06:35.323 --> 06:37.657
Louis, what the hell
did you do?

06:37.692 --> 06:39.025
What?
What are you talking about?

06:39.060 --> 06:40.927
We don't have the money
to hire associates,

06:40.962 --> 06:42.796
paralegals,
and support staff.

06:42.831 --> 06:44.130
I know that.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.965
I'm not an idiot,
they're not support staff.

06:46.001 --> 06:47.200
Who the hell are they?

06:47.235 --> 06:48.368
They're movie extras.

06:48.403 --> 06:50.003
How much weed
did you smoke last night?

06:50.038 --> 06:52.005
We have a settlement meeting
in an hour.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.907
And if these offices are empty
when they walk in,

06:53.942 --> 06:55.175
we are gonna look like shit.

06:55.210 --> 06:57.110
Louis,
did it occur to you

06:57.145 --> 06:59.379
that we're using the threat
of bankruptcy in that meeting,

06:59.414 --> 07:02.415
and if these offices are filled,
it kills that plan?

07:04.419 --> 07:06.553
Everybody drop whatever
the hell it is you're doing

07:06.588 --> 07:08.721
and hand your timecards in
to my secretary.

07:08.757 --> 07:10.657
And if they are marked
one second late,

07:10.692 --> 07:12.091
I swear to God,

07:12.127 --> 07:14.594
you will never be fake
associates in this town again.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.425
Next.

07:28.461 --> 07:29.793
- Hi.
- Inmate's name?

07:29.829 --> 07:32.262
Mike Ross.
I'm here for visitation.

07:32.298 --> 07:35.132
It appears Mr. Ross is not
receiving visitors today.

07:35.167 --> 07:36.467
I-I don't understand.

07:36.502 --> 07:38.635
I was told that I was on
the approved visitors list.

07:38.671 --> 07:41.371
It says visitation
has been suspended for two weeks

07:41.407 --> 07:43.307
because of an altercation
he had this morning.

07:43.342 --> 07:45.809
No, that can't be right.
He just got here yesterday.

07:45.845 --> 07:47.644
It can be right,
and it is right.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.079
Well then, I need to see him
right away.

07:49.115 --> 07:53.217
And I just told you
you can't do that.

07:53.704 --> 07:56.371
Yes, I can because not only
am I his fiancé,

07:56.408 --> 07:58.007
I'm also his lawyer.

07:58.042 --> 08:01.176
It says here a Harvey Specter
is his lawyer.

08:01.212 --> 08:03.712
And he works at Pearson,
Specter, Litt, and so do I.

08:03.748 --> 08:05.315
This card says paralegal.

08:05.349 --> 08:07.182
I don't care what it says.

08:07.218 --> 08:09.218
You don't let me in there
and something's wrong with him,

08:09.253 --> 08:11.220
I will make it
my life's purpose

08:11.255 --> 08:13.155
to make your life
a living hell.

08:13.190 --> 08:16.525
Ma'am, I worked maximum
security for ten years,

08:16.560 --> 08:19.561
so if you think I'm gonna be
intimidated by the likes of you,

08:19.597 --> 08:21.063
you've got another thing coming.

08:23.973 --> 08:26.274
You know, usually it takes
prisoners a couple of weeks

08:26.309 --> 08:27.708
to get their first violation.

08:27.744 --> 08:29.844
You've been here
less than 24 hours.

08:29.879 --> 08:31.412
That might just be
a record.

08:31.447 --> 08:32.647
Yeah, I don't care.
I need to make a phone call.

08:32.682 --> 08:34.414
You're not making anything
after what you just did.

08:34.450 --> 08:36.650
I didn't do anything.
He set me up.

08:36.870 --> 08:37.936
I don't care
what he did.

08:37.971 --> 08:39.404
So all that stuff
about you helping me

08:39.438 --> 08:41.539
become a "better version"
of myself,

08:41.575 --> 08:43.008
that was bullshit?
No, it wasn't.

08:43.043 --> 08:44.309
Then what exactly
did you mean?

08:44.344 --> 08:46.011
Because if you won't even hear
my side of the story,

08:46.046 --> 08:47.278
then how are you
gonna help me?

08:47.314 --> 08:50.548
All right, what do you mean
he set you up?

08:50.763 --> 08:52.529
I mean,
he paid off a guard,

08:52.565 --> 08:54.731
then he posed as my roommate,
and the next thing I know,

08:54.767 --> 08:56.500
he's about to hand out
pictures of my fiancé

08:56.535 --> 08:58.335
to every inmate
in this entire prison.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.437
There's no evidence
of any pictures.

09:00.472 --> 09:01.572
But they were
all over the floor.

09:01.607 --> 09:04.274
This is what
was all over the floor.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.376
Listen to me,
there might not be any proof,

09:06.412 --> 09:08.912
but I am telling you
that he paid off a guard

09:08.948 --> 09:10.681
and you need to do something
about it.

09:10.899 --> 09:12.665
Brother, I don't have
any authority over the guards.

09:12.701 --> 09:14.367
Then what exactly
am I doing here?

09:14.403 --> 09:16.302
You are learning how to deal
with the bullshit

09:16.338 --> 09:18.905
life throws your way without
making your situation worse.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.765
And how the hell
am I supposed to do that?

09:20.794 --> 09:22.794
This isn't just a tea party.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.729
The purpose of this meeting
is to decide

09:24.764 --> 09:27.632
if you are worth
rehabilitating or not.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.000
And if I am?

09:29.035 --> 09:30.668
Then I get you a job.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.739
And if I'm not?

09:34.774 --> 09:36.407
Then you never see me again.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.076
And the next time
you have an incident,

09:38.111 --> 09:42.180
you will go to solitary
confinement for a month.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.048
So I suggest you go back
to your cell

09:44.084 --> 09:45.249
and you think long and hard

09:45.285 --> 09:46.718
about what you want
to accomplish

09:46.753 --> 09:48.119
during your time here.

09:54.704 --> 09:55.870
I have to say,

09:55.905 --> 09:57.071
I'm glad you've decided
to settle

09:57.107 --> 09:58.673
rather than fight
these suits.

09:58.708 --> 10:00.441
Well, as you can see,
things are a little tight

10:00.477 --> 10:03.478
around here, so you have us
at a disadvantage.

10:03.513 --> 10:05.446
What I have is the fact that
you don't want to be talking

10:05.482 --> 10:08.449
about having hired a fraud in
court for the next six months.

10:08.485 --> 10:12.320
No, we don't, so...

10:12.355 --> 10:13.721
With all due respect,
this isn't an offer,

10:13.757 --> 10:14.922
it's a typo.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.624
And with all due respect,
this isn't a lawsuit,

10:16.659 --> 10:18.259
it's a shakedown.
Bullshit.

10:18.294 --> 10:20.161
This is a chance for you
to wipe the slate clean

10:20.196 --> 10:21.596
with the clients
you defrauded.

10:21.631 --> 10:23.364
And $10 million is a hell
of a Goddamn wipe.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.066
It's ten cents
on the dollar.

10:25.101 --> 10:26.167
If you don't take it,
it's going to be

10:26.202 --> 10:27.368
zero cents on the dollar.

10:27.404 --> 10:28.836
What the hell
are you talking about?

10:28.872 --> 10:31.439
This money is from
our partner buy-in fund.

10:31.474 --> 10:33.241
It's the only cash we have.

10:33.276 --> 10:35.877
And once the partners find out
that we're using it to settle,

10:35.912 --> 10:36.844
they're gonna come after it.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.513
So you have about an hour

10:38.548 --> 10:40.248
to sign on the dotted line,

10:40.283 --> 10:41.682
or that money's gone forever.

10:41.718 --> 10:43.184
So take a look around,
Arlene,

10:43.219 --> 10:45.753
'cause once it's gone,
there isn't any more left.

10:45.789 --> 10:48.055
You knowingly defrauded
your own clients.

10:48.091 --> 10:50.057
You made a mockery
of the legal system.

10:50.093 --> 10:52.360
And I won't let you
get away with it.

10:52.395 --> 10:53.861
You want to know something,
Arlene?

10:53.897 --> 10:56.931
We did something wrong,
and now we're paying for it.

10:56.966 --> 10:58.466
But I'm getting a little
sick and tired

10:58.501 --> 11:01.369
of people acting like
Mike Ross screwed them over.

11:01.404 --> 11:04.472
He gave his heart and soul
to every client he ever had,

11:04.507 --> 11:06.340
and if those cases
were reopened,

11:06.376 --> 11:08.910
they would end up exactly
in the same place.

11:08.945 --> 11:11.712
So, you can sign that deal
or not,

11:11.748 --> 11:13.714
but I'm not gonna spend
another second

11:13.750 --> 11:16.117
dealing with a parasite
like you.

11:26.406 --> 11:28.406
Donna, where's Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

11:28.441 --> 11:29.841
He's finishing up
a negotiation.

11:29.876 --> 11:31.976
- This can't wait.
- Why? What's going on?

11:32.012 --> 11:33.811
I got up there
and they turned me away.

11:33.847 --> 11:35.546
No, that can't be.
I got you on that list.

11:35.582 --> 11:36.614
That's not it.
They turned me away

11:36.650 --> 11:37.915
because he got into a fight.

11:37.951 --> 11:39.851
- What? With who?
- I don't know.

11:39.886 --> 11:42.587
All I know is that
I went to go and see him,

11:42.622 --> 11:43.755
they said he got into a fight,

11:43.790 --> 11:45.089
and then they wouldn't
let me in.

11:45.125 --> 11:46.824
- Good.
- How is that good?

11:46.860 --> 11:47.959
Because if they wouldn't
let you in,

11:47.994 --> 11:49.260
it means he fought back.

11:49.296 --> 11:51.195
You don't lose visitation
if you just got jumped.

11:51.231 --> 11:52.497
Harvey, I don't care
if he fought back or not.

11:52.532 --> 11:53.765
It doesn't mean
that he's okay.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.466
Rachel, listen to me.
They have an obligation

11:55.502 --> 11:56.701
to tell you
if he's in the infirmary.

11:56.736 --> 11:58.503
Did they tell you
he was in the infirmary?

11:58.538 --> 11:59.704
No.

11:59.739 --> 12:01.139
Okay, then this is what
I'm gonna do.

12:01.174 --> 12:02.740
I'm gonna call up there
and get to the bottom of this,

12:02.776 --> 12:05.143
but it might take a while,
so I need you to be patient.

12:05.178 --> 12:06.811
Okay.

12:11.785 --> 12:13.785
Donna, cancel my afternoon

12:13.820 --> 12:17.622
and have Ray meet me downstairs
in five minutes.

12:17.657 --> 12:19.590
I thought you said
you weren't worried about Mike.

12:19.626 --> 12:21.726
I only said that
so that she wouldn't worry.

12:21.761 --> 12:23.728
They only take visitation away
if you're the one

12:23.763 --> 12:24.996
who starts the fight,

12:25.031 --> 12:27.131
which means something
Goddamn happened down there

12:27.167 --> 12:29.400
and I'm gonna figure out
what it is.

12:41.388 --> 12:43.555
Gretchen,
what can I do for you?

12:43.591 --> 12:45.424
Well, I thought since
everyone was gone

12:45.459 --> 12:48.694
maybe I could help myself to the
executive kitchen for a change.

12:48.729 --> 12:50.162
For a change?

12:50.197 --> 12:52.130
I wanted to let you know
that I had no idea

12:52.166 --> 12:53.799
those people were leaving
or I never would have gone

12:53.834 --> 12:55.534
to that appointment.
I know, Gretchen.

12:55.569 --> 12:57.202
I would also like
to point out

12:57.238 --> 12:59.371
that since they did leave,

12:59.406 --> 13:01.240
between me, you,
and Rachel Zane,

13:01.275 --> 13:03.342
this firm just got
a whole lot blacker.

13:03.377 --> 13:06.111
Well,
as far as I'm concerned,

13:06.146 --> 13:10.182
that has nothing to do
with anything.

13:10.217 --> 13:11.783
Gretchen,
as long as you're here--

13:11.819 --> 13:13.986
You want to know if I can
handle the reception desk

13:14.021 --> 13:15.354
and Louis at the same time.

13:15.389 --> 13:17.189
How did you know
I was going to ask you that?

13:17.224 --> 13:19.491
Because that's what
good secretaries do.

13:19.526 --> 13:21.193
Sure as shit is.

13:21.228 --> 13:23.295
Well, there's one thing
about everybody being gone.

13:23.330 --> 13:25.931
When would the three of us
ever find ourselves

13:25.966 --> 13:27.499
in here
just shooting the shit?

13:27.534 --> 13:29.568
And when would you have
thought that was a good thing?

13:29.603 --> 13:31.069
This one is a keeper.

13:31.105 --> 13:32.871
I know.

13:32.907 --> 13:34.339
Oh, and for the record,

13:34.375 --> 13:36.942
I'm black in here.

13:47.897 --> 13:49.330
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean

13:49.366 --> 13:51.265
what am I doing here?
I want to know what's going on.

13:51.301 --> 13:52.834
What's going on?
Nothing's going on.

13:52.869 --> 13:54.302
I'm in prison.
Nothing's going on?

13:54.337 --> 13:55.403
Then why do you look
like that?

13:55.438 --> 13:56.371
It is none of your business.

13:56.406 --> 13:57.705
Well, I'm making it
my business

13:57.741 --> 13:59.574
because Rachel came
to visit you this morning,

13:59.609 --> 14:00.875
and they told her
you got in a fight.

14:00.910 --> 14:02.276
Yeah, well, why don't you do
what you always do

14:02.312 --> 14:04.078
and make up some bullshit
and tell her it's not true?

14:04.114 --> 14:05.747
Because I'm busy trying
to survive in here.

14:05.782 --> 14:06.881
Why won't you tell me?

14:06.916 --> 14:08.149
Because you'll try
and handle it for me.

14:08.184 --> 14:09.751
Well, maybe I should be
handling it for you

14:09.786 --> 14:11.686
because you're too stupid
not to piss someone off

14:11.721 --> 14:13.554
on the first day.
Okay, Harvey.

14:13.590 --> 14:15.690
You want to know what happened?
It wasn't me who pissed him off.

14:15.725 --> 14:17.959
It was you.
What are you talking about?

14:17.994 --> 14:20.628
- Frank Gallo.
- Holy shit.

14:20.663 --> 14:21.963
What's he doing in here?
I don't know.

14:21.998 --> 14:23.498
I was hoping
you'd tell me that.

14:23.533 --> 14:24.866
I put him away
for racketeering.

14:24.901 --> 14:26.167
That doesn't make
any sense.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.375
Last time I checked,
that doesn't land him in here.

14:28.411 --> 14:30.244
You're right.
A guy like Gallo

14:30.279 --> 14:33.180
only lands in here
for one reason: good behavior.

14:33.215 --> 14:35.015
Why are you saying that
like it's a good thing?

14:35.050 --> 14:36.850
Because bad behavior
can get him out.

14:36.886 --> 14:38.619
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go to the warden.

14:38.654 --> 14:39.686
Tell him the whole story.

14:39.722 --> 14:40.988
We'll get him outta here
within the week.

14:41.023 --> 14:43.056
That's exactly why
I did not want to tell you.

14:43.092 --> 14:44.658
Look, these guards
are corrupt.

14:44.693 --> 14:46.393
You go to the warden,
it gets back to Gallo,

14:46.429 --> 14:47.961
he's gonna come after me
twice as hard.

14:48.551 --> 14:50.851
It's one week
instead of two years.

14:50.886 --> 14:53.087
Look, we got a chance to get him
outta here, I'm gonna take it.

14:53.122 --> 14:54.288
He's got Rachel's
phone number.

14:54.323 --> 14:56.090
Ye--that's all
the more reason to do it--

14:56.125 --> 14:58.158
God damn it, Harvey!

14:58.194 --> 15:00.027
You pushed me
to beat the shit out of you

15:00.062 --> 15:01.962
so that you'd know I could
take care of myself in here,

15:01.998 --> 15:03.297
now are you gonna
let me do that,

15:03.332 --> 15:06.066
or are you gonna cut my legs
out from under me?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.300
I'll stay out of it.

15:11.335 --> 15:14.837
I want your word.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.273
I won't go to the warden.

15:20.811 --> 15:24.213
Hey, I was wondering
when you'd show up.

15:24.248 --> 15:25.814
Don't act like you don't
remember me, Harvey.

15:25.850 --> 15:27.249
We both know why
you're here.

15:27.285 --> 15:29.084
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.086
I'm here because
I represent the prison.

15:31.122 --> 15:32.421
Bullshit.

15:32.456 --> 15:35.391
I pulled a string
and you came.

15:35.426 --> 15:37.459
You think it's a coincidence
I'm standing here

15:37.495 --> 15:38.727
while you're walking out?

15:38.763 --> 15:42.031
Okay, Gallo,
you got my attention.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.766
You want me to step inside?

15:44.219 --> 15:45.585
Or you want to come out here?

15:45.620 --> 15:48.088
We both know
that's not possible.

15:48.123 --> 15:50.223
You owe me 13 years.

15:50.258 --> 15:51.591
I'm gonna collect.

15:51.626 --> 15:52.859
I didn't do anything to you

15:52.894 --> 15:54.894
that that investigator
didn't start and you know it.

15:54.930 --> 15:57.030
Well, if his little boyfriend
ever shows up in here,

15:57.065 --> 15:58.431
I'll be sure to take it up
with him.

15:58.467 --> 15:59.467
What do you want, Gallo?

15:59.501 --> 16:01.368
I already have
what I want.

16:01.403 --> 16:03.436
Which is knowing that every time
your phone rings,

16:03.472 --> 16:05.905
you're gonna ask yourself is
this the call where you find out

16:05.941 --> 16:07.407
that the guy who's in here
for you

16:07.442 --> 16:09.209
is never coming out.

16:10.645 --> 16:12.345
Listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

16:12.381 --> 16:14.147
you think I can't hurt you
in here?

16:14.182 --> 16:16.182
I'll put a Goddamn bounty
on your head.

16:16.218 --> 16:18.385
I'll pay 'em whatever it takes
to break your legs.

16:18.420 --> 16:19.819
And if that doesn't work,

16:19.855 --> 16:23.056
I'll wait till you get out
and I'll kill you myself.

16:23.091 --> 16:24.457
So unless you want that
to happen,

16:24.493 --> 16:27.994
don't you ever even look
at Mike Ross again.

16:33.123 --> 16:36.291
Ring, ring, counselor.

16:36.326 --> 16:38.159
Ring, ring.

16:41.164 --> 16:42.530
I knew I'd find you here.

16:42.566 --> 16:43.798
'Cause this is where you come

16:43.834 --> 16:45.200
when you think
you just beat somebody.

16:45.235 --> 16:46.534
What can I do for you, Jack?

16:46.570 --> 16:47.702
You can tell me
you used your own money

16:47.737 --> 16:49.170
to settle that lawsuit.

16:49.206 --> 16:51.639
'Cause if you didn't,
we're gonna have a problem.

16:51.675 --> 16:52.941
Then I'd say we have
a problem.

16:52.976 --> 16:55.143
God damn it.
You used the buy-in fund.

16:55.178 --> 16:56.544
Yes, we did.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.213
Then I guess...

16:58.248 --> 16:59.514
I'll see you in court.

16:59.549 --> 17:02.283
You're suing me personally?

17:02.319 --> 17:04.719
- It's your name on the door.
- Oh, Jack.

17:05.212 --> 17:07.512
I know corporate structures
were never your strong suit,

17:07.548 --> 17:09.181
so I'm gonna explain something
to you.

17:09.215 --> 17:11.250
We may use the word
"partnership,"

17:11.285 --> 17:13.152
but this is a LLC.

17:13.186 --> 17:15.621
And no judge in the world
is going to let you

17:15.656 --> 17:16.955
pierce that corporate veil.

17:16.991 --> 17:19.692
They will once they learn
you knowingly hired a fraud.

17:19.727 --> 17:21.827
One has nothing to do
with the other.

17:21.862 --> 17:24.229
And if you really did
find a judge who would do that,

17:24.265 --> 17:27.866
then you'd be here with an army
of lawyers and a Brinks truck

17:27.902 --> 17:30.069
instead of standing alone
with a flimsy piece of paper

17:30.104 --> 17:31.337
in your sweaty
little hands.

17:31.890 --> 17:33.923
You can talk tough
all you want, Jessica.

17:33.959 --> 17:37.961
The fact is, I do have an army
of lawyers and you don't.

17:37.996 --> 17:39.262
What are you talking about?

17:39.297 --> 17:41.965
I took that job
with Robert Zane after all.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.566
And I'm willing to drag
this fight out,

17:43.602 --> 17:45.602
so the choice is yours.

17:45.637 --> 17:49.672
Give us our money
or go out of business.

18:04.315 --> 18:07.483
Can I talk to you
for a second?

18:07.518 --> 18:09.518
About what?

18:12.390 --> 18:15.691
Listen, a man's cell should be
the one place he can feel safe.

18:15.726 --> 18:17.693
I took that away from you,
and I'm sorry.

18:17.728 --> 18:19.561
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't do
shit for me in here.

18:19.597 --> 18:21.463
I know.

18:21.499 --> 18:23.933
That's why I want
to make it up to you.

18:23.968 --> 18:25.501
Are you kidding me?

18:25.536 --> 18:27.236
That's exactly what got me
in this situation

18:27.271 --> 18:28.437
in the first place.
I know that.

18:28.472 --> 18:29.905
But I also know
you wanted to call

18:29.941 --> 18:32.141
whoever you wanted to call
this morning.

18:32.491 --> 18:33.657
And I'm trying
to make it up to you.

18:33.692 --> 18:35.058
Yeah, well,
this doesn't do that.

18:35.094 --> 18:36.393
Hey, look,
I can get in a lot of trouble

18:36.428 --> 18:37.494
for just letting you know
I have this.

18:37.529 --> 18:38.462
Why don't you do
something else

18:38.497 --> 18:39.663
that can get you
into trouble?

18:39.698 --> 18:40.931
What are you talking about?

18:40.966 --> 18:42.899
Tell them that Gallo paid
the guards to have you switch.

18:42.935 --> 18:43.900
I can't do that.

18:43.936 --> 18:44.901
Yeah,
because you're afraid of him.

18:44.937 --> 18:46.603
You're damn straight I am.

18:46.850 --> 18:48.349
And on top of that,
I'd make a permanent enemy

18:48.384 --> 18:49.717
of everyone else in here,

18:49.752 --> 18:51.352
because the worst thing
you can be known for, my man,

18:51.387 --> 18:53.654
is as someone who would
do something like that.

18:53.690 --> 18:56.624
Which means I get to deal
with this all by myself.

18:59.229 --> 19:00.828
It's all right,
you can stay.

19:00.864 --> 19:02.263
It doesn't matter
if he stays or goes,

19:02.298 --> 19:03.698
I got nothing to say
to you.

19:03.733 --> 19:07.368
That's okay, 'cause I got
something to say to you.

19:07.403 --> 19:11.072
You want to know what my
favorite time of day is in here?

19:11.107 --> 19:12.840
It's right now.

19:12.876 --> 19:14.408
Got the TV going.

19:14.444 --> 19:17.645
Guys are sitting around
playing cards, telling jokes.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.213
You almost forget
you're in prison,

19:19.249 --> 19:20.781
which is why
I came over here.

19:20.817 --> 19:24.318
'Cause I want to make sure
you never forget.

19:24.354 --> 19:25.920
There's gonna come a time

19:25.955 --> 19:27.922
when this place isn't filled
with people,

19:27.957 --> 19:29.891
and you and I are alone.

19:29.926 --> 19:33.127
Then all those vicious threats

19:33.162 --> 19:36.898
your boy Harvey Specter
made to me today

19:36.933 --> 19:39.100
aren't gonna save you.

19:58.302 --> 20:02.938
I heard today was a good day
for Rand, Kaldor, Zane.

20:02.973 --> 20:05.908
If this is about me hiring
Jack Soloff's department,

20:06.319 --> 20:08.119
I didn't do it
to stick it to you.

20:08.154 --> 20:09.787
They were leaving anyway.
Maybe.

20:09.822 --> 20:11.389
But if your first move
is to have them come after

20:11.424 --> 20:14.492
their partner money,
then I must have been wrong

20:14.527 --> 20:15.726
that we were on good terms.

20:15.762 --> 20:18.429
Jessica,
I accepted your apology.

20:18.464 --> 20:20.231
I wouldn't say that makes us
on good terms.

20:20.673 --> 20:23.140
But I had nothing to do with him
coming after your money.

20:23.176 --> 20:24.642
That's between you and him.

20:24.677 --> 20:26.077
But you do have the power
to stop it.

20:26.112 --> 20:28.412
And I am not in the habit of
telling my brand new employees

20:28.448 --> 20:29.947
what they can and can't do.

20:29.983 --> 20:31.148
Well, I need you
to do it anyway.

20:31.184 --> 20:32.149
Jessica--

20:32.185 --> 20:34.919
Robert...

20:34.954 --> 20:37.655
I need this.

20:37.690 --> 20:39.023
And I know it's not
your style

20:39.058 --> 20:41.692
to tell your partners
what to do,

20:41.728 --> 20:44.829
but if you don't make it
your style,

20:44.864 --> 20:46.931
I'm dead in the water.

20:55.961 --> 20:57.327
This is Harvey Specter.

20:57.363 --> 20:59.262
<i>You have a call</i>
<i>from Danbury Federal Prison.</i>

20:59.298 --> 21:01.264
<i>Do you accept the charges?</i>
Yes.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.367
<i>I do not understand</i>
<i>your response.</i>

21:03.402 --> 21:06.403
Yes. God damn it.
<i>Please respond yes or no.</i>

21:06.438 --> 21:08.472
Yes.

21:08.507 --> 21:10.240
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Oh, Mike, thank God.

21:10.275 --> 21:12.142
Thank God what?
You looked me in the eye

21:12.357 --> 21:13.557
and you said
you would stay out of it.

21:13.592 --> 21:14.958
You couldn't even make it
to the parking lot

21:14.993 --> 21:16.593
<i>without threatening Gallo?</i>
Mike, listen to me.

21:16.627 --> 21:17.960
No, what,
so you can lie to me again?

21:17.995 --> 21:19.328
<i>Or are you gonna tell me</i>
<i>you didn't do that?</i>

21:19.363 --> 21:20.329
Look, I didn't do it
because I didn't think

21:20.364 --> 21:21.564
you could handle yourself.

21:21.599 --> 21:23.098
<i>I did it because</i>
<i>he got under my skin.</i>

21:23.134 --> 21:25.134
I don't give a shit
why you did it.

21:25.169 --> 21:26.368
<i>You swore you wouldn't.</i>

21:26.404 --> 21:27.536
<i>Instead,</i>
<i>you've made things worse.</i>

21:27.572 --> 21:28.971
Harvey, if I can't even
trust you,

21:29.006 --> 21:30.506
then I do not stand a chance
in here.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.131
Look, I can't talk
right now.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.298
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>you can't talk?</i>

21:33.334 --> 21:36.201
Rachel's in my office
looking at me right now

21:36.237 --> 21:37.770
<i>and she's gonna think</i>
<i>something's wrong</i>

21:37.805 --> 21:40.873
in five seconds, so unless
you've changed your mind

21:40.908 --> 21:42.808
about me not telling her,
I gotta go.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.109
Harvey, you gotta get
the phone from her.

21:44.412 --> 21:45.944
Sure, Rick, no problem.
8:30 sounds great.

21:45.980 --> 21:48.180
<i>Harvey, get the phone</i>
<i>from her.</i>

21:48.215 --> 21:49.748
First round's on you.

21:49.784 --> 21:50.824
Rachel, good, you're here.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.117
I was just gonna
come see you.

21:52.153 --> 21:53.686
I didn't hear from you,
so I just figured--

21:53.721 --> 21:55.587
He's good. There was an error
in the paperwork.

21:55.623 --> 21:58.624
It's a different inmate,
same last name.

21:58.659 --> 22:00.926
Okay.
So I can see him tomorrow.

22:00.961 --> 22:03.462
Actually, he asked
that you give him a little time.

22:03.497 --> 22:04.630
What?

22:04.665 --> 22:07.499
Rachel,
prison is a big adjustment.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.034
He'll be ready
in about two weeks.

22:09.243 --> 22:11.476
So then, why do I have
about 50 texts from him

22:11.512 --> 22:13.178
saying that he can't wait
to see me?

22:13.213 --> 22:14.686
- What?
- Harvey, what's going on?

22:14.687 --> 22:16.120
- Give me the phone.
- No.

22:16.155 --> 22:17.588
- I said give me the phone.
- I'm not giving you anything

22:17.623 --> 22:20.024
until you tell me
what's going on.

22:20.059 --> 22:21.625
Those texts
aren't from Mike.

22:21.660 --> 22:22.693
Then who are they from?

22:22.728 --> 22:24.828
From a guy I put away
when I was an ADA.

22:24.864 --> 22:25.996
Oh, my God.

22:26.032 --> 22:27.998
Rachel, don't let
your imagination run wild.

22:28.034 --> 22:29.566
It's gonna be okay.
You don't know that

22:29.602 --> 22:31.869
because you're not in there.
You're right, I'm not.

22:31.904 --> 22:33.103
Then what the hell
are you gonna do about it?

22:33.139 --> 22:34.938
I'm gonna do
what I promised Mike.

22:34.974 --> 22:37.074
I'm gonna have faith
that he can handle it.

22:37.109 --> 22:38.642
I don't believe it.
So you're not gonna do anything?

22:38.677 --> 22:41.178
You think I don't want to bust
him outta there right now?

22:41.213 --> 22:43.480
Look, if I try and do something
and it doesn't work,

22:43.516 --> 22:45.416
it makes it worse for him.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.317
- Is he violent?
- Rachel--

22:47.353 --> 22:49.353
- Is he violent?
- I made him a promise--

22:49.388 --> 22:51.088
I don't give a shit.

22:51.123 --> 22:53.090
He's in there to protect you,
so you better figure out

22:53.125 --> 22:55.125
a way to protect him
because Goddamn it, Harvey,

22:55.161 --> 22:57.061
if something happens to him
in there

22:57.096 --> 22:58.495
and you didn't do anything,

22:58.531 --> 23:01.698
I will never forgive you.

23:05.337 --> 23:07.171
Harvey, I know you don't
need me to tell you this,

23:07.206 --> 23:09.206
but she's right, because
if something actually does

23:09.241 --> 23:12.476
happen to Mike,
even if she forgives you,

23:12.511 --> 23:14.445
you're never gonna
forgive yourself.

23:27.152 --> 23:28.217
What do you want, Harvey?

23:28.253 --> 23:30.053
Five minutes of your time
and that's all.

23:30.088 --> 23:32.822
Five minutes to catch up,
or five minutes to ask a favor?

23:32.857 --> 23:35.758
Five minutes to help me
protect Mike Ross.

23:35.794 --> 23:37.660
Protect him how?
'Cause last time I checked,

23:37.696 --> 23:39.696
he was in the bosom of
the federal penitentiary system.

23:39.731 --> 23:41.564
Sean, he's in there
with a guy I put away

23:41.599 --> 23:44.133
and the guy is no joke.

23:44.169 --> 23:45.535
I'm sorry to hear that,
Harvey.

23:45.570 --> 23:46.769
But what am I supposed to do?

23:46.805 --> 23:48.971
You're supposed to move
the guy to another prison.

23:49.007 --> 23:50.940
I don't have the authority
to do that and you know that.

23:50.975 --> 23:53.443
You can get the authority.
You're a federal prosecutor.

23:53.478 --> 23:55.078
Then why the hell don't you
go after the prosecutor

23:55.113 --> 23:56.345
that put Mike away
in the first place?

23:56.381 --> 23:58.981
'Cause she doesn't owe me,
and you do.

23:59.532 --> 24:01.232
You got a lot of balls
saying that to me

24:01.267 --> 24:02.866
when the entire time
we were working together,

24:02.902 --> 24:04.168
you knew the kid
was a fraud.

24:04.203 --> 24:06.971
That kid helped you take down
Charles Forstman

24:07.006 --> 24:09.173
and Eric Woodall
and put you on the map.

24:09.208 --> 24:10.307
The map?
Bullshit.

24:10.343 --> 24:12.142
I was on the map long before
I met either of you.

24:12.178 --> 24:13.611
You're going to tell me
you haven't shot up the ranks

24:13.646 --> 24:15.112
since that conviction?

24:15.147 --> 24:16.413
You know, Harvey,

24:16.449 --> 24:17.948
when you first walked in here,

24:17.984 --> 24:20.150
for a second I actually thought
you were gonna apologize

24:20.186 --> 24:22.186
for lying to me
all that time.

24:22.343 --> 24:24.276
I don't need
your forgiveness, Sean.

24:24.312 --> 24:26.011
I need your help.

24:31.986 --> 24:34.286
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

24:34.322 --> 24:38.591
But, Harvey,
now you owe me one.

24:58.771 --> 25:00.437
Jack?

25:00.473 --> 25:03.140
I've had a long day.
What are you doing here?

25:03.175 --> 25:04.942
You know
what I'm doing here.

25:04.977 --> 25:07.411
You went to Robert Zane
and you had him shut us down.

25:07.446 --> 25:09.813
I did what I had to do.

25:09.849 --> 25:11.281
Now if you'll excuse me.

25:11.317 --> 25:15.152
All I wanted was
my money back.

25:15.187 --> 25:19.356
Well, the sooner you get used
to the fact that it's gone,

25:19.391 --> 25:21.792
the sooner we can both
move on with our lives.

25:21.827 --> 25:24.094
That's the problem.
I can't move on with my life.

25:24.130 --> 25:25.295
What are you talking about?

25:25.331 --> 25:26.764
I can't afford Zane's buy-in.

25:26.799 --> 25:28.599
What?

25:29.155 --> 25:30.488
How is that possible?

25:30.523 --> 25:31.789
Jessica, listen to me.

25:31.824 --> 25:34.759
You know what I did
that Hardman found out about,

25:34.794 --> 25:38.062
but what you don't know
is why I did it.

25:38.097 --> 25:39.363
I needed the money.

25:39.399 --> 25:41.732
And now you want me
to give you your money back

25:41.768 --> 25:42.933
out of my own pocket?

25:42.969 --> 25:45.236
Jessica, please.

25:45.271 --> 25:48.005
This is a chance for me
to have a new start.

25:48.041 --> 25:50.241
Even if I wanted to,
I can't do that.

25:50.276 --> 25:52.276
- Why not?
- You know why not.

25:52.312 --> 25:54.645
I pay you
out of my own pocket.

25:54.681 --> 25:56.947
I'm piercing
that corporate veil myself.

25:56.983 --> 26:00.051
And if the partners find out,
it will cost me millions.

26:00.086 --> 26:01.285
They won't find out.

26:01.321 --> 26:02.420
Well, I can't take
that chance.

26:02.455 --> 26:04.922
Jessica, I need this.

26:07.160 --> 26:11.629
I'm sorry, Jack.

26:11.664 --> 26:14.298
I can't help you.

26:30.587 --> 26:31.720
Morning.

26:35.325 --> 26:37.259
What?

26:37.294 --> 26:39.094
You know what.

26:39.129 --> 26:40.228
Do I have something
in my teeth?

26:40.264 --> 26:42.631
No, but you got
some bullshit in your brain.

26:42.666 --> 26:44.800
- Excuse me?
- "Black in here."

26:44.835 --> 26:47.369
Please, you're the whitest
woman I ever met.

26:47.404 --> 26:49.538
Oh, is that a fact?

26:49.573 --> 26:50.872
Tell me something different.

26:50.908 --> 26:53.875
How about I show you
something different?

26:57.912 --> 27:00.279
- Is that...
- Yep.

27:00.314 --> 27:02.515
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Nope.

27:02.550 --> 27:04.250
- What year was that?
- '96.

27:04.285 --> 27:07.953
- How long were you together?
- Seven months.

27:07.989 --> 27:09.321
That that, Mrs. Hater.

27:09.357 --> 27:11.457
Before his last album
or after?

27:13.528 --> 27:17.029
Who do you think
that song was about?

27:17.064 --> 27:20.566
Shit.
"Black in here."

27:20.601 --> 27:23.536
She's black all over.

27:25.369 --> 27:26.802
I'm glad we came
to an agreement.

27:26.838 --> 27:29.104
And it's usually not my habit
to court a dalliance

27:29.140 --> 27:30.940
with opposing counsel,
but I couldn't help but notice

27:30.975 --> 27:32.041
you don't have a ring
on your finger.

27:32.076 --> 27:33.742
Not in a million years,
Mr. Litt.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.144
Go back to your own side.

27:35.179 --> 27:38.247
Wow, man puts himself out
there, the least you can do is--

27:38.282 --> 27:39.648
Regarding the class action

27:39.684 --> 27:41.584
against Pearson, Specter, Litt,

27:41.619 --> 27:43.552
do both parties agree to
the terms of the settlement?

27:43.588 --> 27:45.487
- We do, Your honor.
- We do as well, Your Honor.

27:45.523 --> 27:46.989
Then unless there are
any objections,

27:47.024 --> 27:49.325
I see no reason for this court
not to ratify--

27:49.360 --> 27:51.060
I have an objection,
Your Honor.

27:51.095 --> 27:54.496
- What?
- And you are?

27:54.532 --> 27:56.131
His name is
A. Elliott Stemple, Your Honor,

27:56.167 --> 27:57.600
and he has no standing
in this case.

27:57.635 --> 27:58.601
Mr. Litt.

27:58.636 --> 28:01.103
I have no standing,
Your Honor.

28:01.138 --> 28:02.838
But I represent
Rothman Insurance,

28:02.874 --> 28:04.773
a company not included
in the class of clients

28:04.809 --> 28:08.077
misrepresented by a firm
that knowingly hired a fraud.

28:08.112 --> 28:10.412
There's not one shred of proof
we knowingly did anything.

28:10.448 --> 28:12.248
But there is proof
that you employed a fraud,

28:12.283 --> 28:13.749
which is why you're settling
with Ms. Rosen

28:13.784 --> 28:15.150
in the first place.

28:15.186 --> 28:17.019
- Are you in on this?
- Are you kidding me?

28:17.054 --> 28:18.587
All right, Mr. Stemple.
Submit your evidence.

28:18.623 --> 28:20.289
The court will rule on it
tomorrow.

28:26.178 --> 28:28.445
We may have agreed to
ten cents on the dollar,

28:28.480 --> 28:29.980
but if this goes south,

28:30.015 --> 28:32.916
we're coming after you
for every penny you've got.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.482
You little son of a bitch.

28:38.517 --> 28:40.183
Watch it, Litt.
We're in a court of law.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.319
I don't care where we are.
Jack Soloff put you up to this,

28:42.354 --> 28:43.453
and I know it.
So what?

28:43.489 --> 28:44.489
So I'm gonna prove it.

28:44.523 --> 28:45.755
And when the judge realizes
what you did,

28:45.791 --> 28:47.624
he's gonna throw your ass
in jail.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.326
Really?
Huh.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.361
Because the way I see it,
the judge is gonna certify

28:51.396 --> 28:53.730
that my client is a member of
this class because they are one

28:53.765 --> 28:55.405
whether Jack tipped me off
to them or not.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.234
And when that happens,
I kill the deal,

28:57.269 --> 28:59.803
and your money goes back to the
partners that you took it from.

28:59.838 --> 29:02.806
So, why don't you march
your fat feet

29:02.841 --> 29:04.040
back to
the only two lawyers left

29:04.076 --> 29:05.275
at that miserable little firm

29:05.310 --> 29:07.110
and decide just how deep
you're gonna reach

29:07.146 --> 29:09.212
into your own pockets
to pay me off.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.981
Because as I see it,
phew,

29:11.016 --> 29:14.584
you have about 24 hours
until you lose everything.

29:24.472 --> 29:25.905
What do you want now,
Harvey?

29:25.941 --> 29:28.608
I wanted to apologize
for what happened with Gallo.

29:28.643 --> 29:29.842
It was wrong.

29:29.878 --> 29:32.578
Shouldn't have happened,
and I'm sorry.

29:34.849 --> 29:36.482
But?

29:36.518 --> 29:38.117
But I don't care
what I promised you

29:38.153 --> 29:40.219
because I found a way
to get him out of here,

29:40.255 --> 29:41.921
and I'm gonna take it.

29:41.957 --> 29:43.690
I told you,
you go to the warden--

29:43.725 --> 29:46.025
I'm not going to the warden.
I went to Sean Cahill.

29:46.061 --> 29:47.961
Which means Gallo won't know
about it

29:47.996 --> 29:49.595
until they're putting
shackles on him

29:49.631 --> 29:52.598
to take him back to wherever
the hell he came from.

29:57.272 --> 30:00.373
What are you not
telling me?

30:00.408 --> 30:02.742
I put him away
for racketeering.

30:02.777 --> 30:04.677
But that's not what
he really did.

30:04.713 --> 30:05.979
What are you talking about?

30:06.569 --> 30:10.538
We had him for
conspiracy to commit murder.

30:10.573 --> 30:13.607
And the police let the tape
of that bastard admitting

30:13.643 --> 30:15.809
that he did it
out of the chain of custody

30:15.845 --> 30:17.912
for 20 minutes.

30:17.947 --> 30:20.814
So you went after him
for racketeering instead.

30:20.850 --> 30:23.984
I used every trick I had
to put him away for 15 years

30:24.020 --> 30:27.087
for three crimes that would have
added to five years at the most.

30:27.123 --> 30:29.423
And that's why he hates you
so much.

30:29.458 --> 30:30.424
It's also why I need you
to lay low

30:30.459 --> 30:31.699
until I can get him
out of here.

30:31.727 --> 30:33.360
Oh, I can appreciate that,
Harvey,

30:33.396 --> 30:37.231
but I can't exactly hide
in my cell 24 hours a day.

30:37.266 --> 30:40.367
Then I suggest you do
the complete opposite.

30:45.863 --> 30:48.197
You know, I don't normally
take walk-ins.

30:48.232 --> 30:49.932
Sorry.

30:49.967 --> 30:51.800
Well,
as long as you're here.

30:51.836 --> 30:54.436
Well, I thought about it,
and...

30:54.472 --> 30:55.504
I'd like a job.

30:55.540 --> 30:57.072
And if it's not
too much trouble,

30:57.108 --> 30:59.542
I'd like it to be in front
of as many people as possible.

30:59.577 --> 31:00.943
And why is that?

31:00.978 --> 31:03.479
It'll be easier for me to stay
out of trouble in a crowd.

31:03.514 --> 31:05.281
Good.

31:05.316 --> 31:07.950
Because I got you
a job in the kitchen.

31:07.985 --> 31:09.018
Thank you.

31:09.053 --> 31:10.352
Don't thank me.
Thank yourself.

31:10.388 --> 31:11.520
If you hadn't come in
to see me,

31:11.556 --> 31:14.523
I never would have
told you about it.

31:17.695 --> 31:19.295
Is that true?

31:19.330 --> 31:21.697
You don't really take walk-ins?

31:21.732 --> 31:23.432
Nah.

31:23.467 --> 31:25.734
Just something to say.

31:29.541 --> 31:30.506
The billing records
are right there.

31:30.542 --> 31:31.674
Mike was at the meeting.

31:31.709 --> 31:33.609
Shit, you're right.
He's got us.

31:33.645 --> 31:35.178
- You know what this means.
- I do.

31:35.213 --> 31:36.413
Louis, I just got
your message.

31:36.447 --> 31:37.980
What's going on?
Harvey, we got a problem,

31:38.016 --> 31:38.981
and you're not
going to like it.

31:39.017 --> 31:40.383
Elliott Stemple showed up
in court

31:40.418 --> 31:42.685
with an excluded member
of the class.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.620
Elliott Stemple?
Are you kidding me?

31:44.656 --> 31:46.923
He ambushed me, Harvey.
The judge was about to ratify

31:46.958 --> 31:48.291
the settlement
when he comes out of nowhere.

31:48.326 --> 31:49.659
What was I supposed to do?

31:49.694 --> 31:51.127
You prove his client
isn't part of the class,

31:51.162 --> 31:52.628
and you shut this thing down.

31:52.664 --> 31:55.231
I can't do that because his
client is a part of the class.

31:55.266 --> 31:57.800
- What? That's not possible.
- Yes, it is.

31:57.836 --> 31:59.802
Mike took one meeting
with Rothman Insurance.

31:59.838 --> 32:01.370
Jack Soloff told Stemple
about it.

32:01.406 --> 32:03.372
- No way.
- It's all right here, Harvey.

32:03.408 --> 32:04.574
And if we don't pay him off
tonight,

32:04.609 --> 32:06.008
he kills that deal tomorrow

32:06.044 --> 32:07.877
and we're out of business
ten minutes later.

32:07.912 --> 32:09.078
Bullshit.
That's blackmail.

32:09.113 --> 32:10.313
I'm not giving in
to blackmail.

32:10.348 --> 32:11.414
Oh, come on,
do you think I want to do this?

32:11.449 --> 32:12.882
He's got us by the balls,
Harvey.

32:12.917 --> 32:14.517
If we don't pay him, what was
everything we went through

32:14.552 --> 32:15.785
the other night even for?

32:15.820 --> 32:17.053
Which means right now,
we just have to figure out

32:17.088 --> 32:18.688
how much we're willing to pay.

32:18.723 --> 32:20.590
No, we don't.

32:20.625 --> 32:22.725
Harvey,
what are you saying?

32:22.760 --> 32:24.927
I'm saying Stemple
doesn't care about you two.

32:24.963 --> 32:27.663
He just wants to get in a room
with me and see me bleed.

32:27.699 --> 32:29.365
You are not paying that man
out of your pocket.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.300
- Yes, I am.
- Harvey, Jessica's right.

32:31.336 --> 32:32.301
No, she's not.

32:32.337 --> 32:34.570
We all know
I got us into this mess.

32:34.606 --> 32:36.939
It's time for me
to get is out of it.

32:36.975 --> 32:38.474
All right,
you want him, you got him.

32:38.509 --> 32:40.409
But you're gonna be tempted
to rip that man's head off,

32:40.445 --> 32:43.079
and when that happens,
you're not going to do that.

32:43.114 --> 32:44.513
You're going to pay him.

32:44.549 --> 32:47.516
And then you're going to throw
his sorry ass out of here.

32:57.116 --> 32:58.549
Harvey, do you have
a minute?

32:58.584 --> 33:00.918
If it's quick.
Someone's on their way over.

33:00.953 --> 33:04.321
I want to apologize to you
about earlier.

33:04.356 --> 33:05.522
You don't need to do that.

33:05.558 --> 33:07.257
Yes, I do.

33:07.293 --> 33:10.060
I know that you're doing
what you feel is best.

33:10.096 --> 33:12.663
I just...

33:12.698 --> 33:15.132
I didn't think this was
going to be as hard as it is.

33:15.167 --> 33:16.433
For me too.

33:16.469 --> 33:18.102
And for what it's worth,

33:18.137 --> 33:20.237
I took your advice.

33:20.272 --> 33:23.941
I'm gonna get that guy
out of there.

33:23.976 --> 33:25.909
Thank you.

33:29.014 --> 33:31.782
Rachel?

33:31.817 --> 33:34.485
He's gonna be okay.

33:49.965 --> 33:51.598
Aren't you getting
a little long in the tooth

33:51.633 --> 33:54.234
for that hottie I just saw
in the hall?

33:54.269 --> 33:56.536
Let's get to it, Stemple,
because I'm not in the mood.

33:56.572 --> 33:58.071
How much?

33:58.106 --> 33:59.306
How much what?

33:59.341 --> 34:02.375
How much to let me
have my firm?

34:02.411 --> 34:04.344
Do you mean to imply
that I'm simply here

34:04.379 --> 34:05.679
on a mission to extort you?

34:05.714 --> 34:07.847
Oh, we both know you're here
to get my money

34:07.883 --> 34:09.322
so you can split it
with Jack Soloff.

34:09.351 --> 34:12.652
I resent that you think
so little of me.

34:12.688 --> 34:14.688
You saying that's not why
you're here?

34:14.723 --> 34:19.592
I'm saying I don't give a shit
about your money or Jack Soloff.

34:19.628 --> 34:21.695
I want a piece of you.

34:24.705 --> 34:27.304
Get your Goddamn hands
off that.

34:27.341 --> 34:29.908
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey.
Relax.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.876
I didn't come here to put
my gentle hands

34:31.911 --> 34:33.978
on your precious balls.

34:34.014 --> 34:36.915
I came here to take something
far more valuable.

34:36.949 --> 34:40.518
'Cause what I want is that
piece of shit duck painting.

34:44.524 --> 34:45.590
What?

34:45.626 --> 34:47.425
That right there.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.293
I was right.

34:49.329 --> 34:50.728
If that didn't mean something
to you, you would have

34:50.764 --> 34:52.563
jumped right out of your chair
and said okay to me.

34:52.599 --> 34:54.331
- Stemple, listen--
- Not to mention,

34:54.368 --> 34:55.800
you've had that thing
as long as I've known you,

34:55.835 --> 34:57.902
and there's no way a guy like
you has a painting like that

34:57.938 --> 34:59.638
unless it means everything
to him.

34:59.673 --> 35:01.039
How much money, Stemple?

35:01.074 --> 35:03.241
Because you are not
getting that painting.

35:03.277 --> 35:04.943
- $10 million.
- Elliott.

35:04.978 --> 35:06.611
- 15 million.
- Goddamn it.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.179
20 million.
Do you want to keep going?

35:08.215 --> 35:10.615
Or have you had enough?
Because in ten seconds,

35:10.651 --> 35:13.385
I am walking out of here
with $20 million

35:13.420 --> 35:14.953
or that thing in my hands.

35:14.988 --> 35:18.890
Or tomorrow morning, I'm putting
your firm in the ground.

35:25.112 --> 35:27.413
Take the painting.

35:42.296 --> 35:44.229
Hey, hey.

35:44.265 --> 35:47.199
I know you don't trust me,
but look who's headed this way.

35:47.234 --> 35:50.135
On top of that,
people are leaving.

35:50.171 --> 35:53.105
You should leave, too.

35:53.140 --> 35:54.974
No.
That's what he wants.

35:55.009 --> 35:56.175
He wants me to go somewhere

35:56.210 --> 35:57.409
where those guards
don't have a view of me.

35:57.445 --> 35:58.611
And for all I know,
he sent you to help him.

35:58.646 --> 35:59.578
You don't know
what you're talking about--

35:59.614 --> 36:01.580
Leave me alone.

36:04.852 --> 36:05.784
Hey there, Mike.

36:05.820 --> 36:08.420
What you reading?
"Outliers"?

36:11.514 --> 36:13.747
I don't know what you think
is gonna happen here, Frank,

36:13.783 --> 36:17.117
but I'm not gonna let you
trick me into leaving this room.

36:17.153 --> 36:19.386
I don't need to trick you.
This room will do just fine.

36:19.422 --> 36:21.155
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you tell that

36:21.190 --> 36:22.623
to the two guards
sitting behind me?

36:22.658 --> 36:26.226
You mean the ones
who let me into your cell?

36:31.615 --> 36:35.083
They took a little
cigarette break, Mike.

36:35.119 --> 36:38.220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:38.255 --> 36:40.455
So that's it?

36:40.490 --> 36:41.656
You're gonna let
these guys kill me?

36:41.692 --> 36:43.491
Who said anything
about killing you?

36:43.527 --> 36:45.527
We're just gonna hurt you
a little, or a lot.

36:45.562 --> 36:47.002
No, no, no, no, no.
What I meant was,

36:47.030 --> 36:49.698
are you really too much of a
pussy to take me on by yourself?

36:49.733 --> 36:50.865
You think they won't
come at you

36:50.901 --> 36:52.200
just because you called
me out?

36:52.235 --> 36:53.969
Oh, no, I think that
men respond to leaders.

36:54.004 --> 36:56.137
And if you're too afraid
to take on a guy like me,

36:56.173 --> 36:59.274
you're not gonna be a leader
for much longer.

36:59.309 --> 37:00.842
Okay, tough guy.

37:00.877 --> 37:02.611
You want me one-on-one,
you got it.

37:02.646 --> 37:04.613
One little thing:
I'm gonna use this

37:04.648 --> 37:06.781
and they're gonna hold you.
No, no, no!

37:06.817 --> 37:08.516
No!
What's going on here?

37:08.552 --> 37:10.251
Huh? What?
Nothing.

37:10.287 --> 37:12.854
You have the same story?

37:18.128 --> 37:20.729
Yeah.

37:20.764 --> 37:22.130
Yeah,
nothing's going on here.

37:22.165 --> 37:23.898
Then why don't you three
get away from him,

37:23.934 --> 37:25.033
and go to your cells?

37:25.068 --> 37:26.301
And I don't want to see you
back in here

37:26.336 --> 37:28.770
for the rest of the night.

37:44.953 --> 37:47.787
I just saw Stemple
walking out of here...

37:47.822 --> 37:50.123
with a canvas that looks
about the same size

37:50.158 --> 37:51.457
as that empty space
on your wall.

37:51.493 --> 37:53.059
He won't be back.

37:53.094 --> 37:55.094
So it's done?

37:55.130 --> 37:57.096
It's done.

37:59.834 --> 38:01.634
Harvey?

38:01.670 --> 38:04.537
I remember you told me
that painting

38:04.573 --> 38:07.941
was the one happy memory
you had of your mother before--

38:07.976 --> 38:09.943
Like I said, Jessica,

38:09.978 --> 38:13.179
I was the one
who got us into this mess.

38:13.214 --> 38:16.449
I'm the one who needed to
get us out of it.

38:27.862 --> 38:29.829
Well?

38:29.864 --> 38:30.897
It's done.

38:30.932 --> 38:33.466
Thank God.

38:33.501 --> 38:35.435
So, you want to go get Harvey?

38:35.470 --> 38:36.769
Have a drink and celebrate?

38:36.805 --> 38:39.405
Harvey needs to be alone
right now, Louis.

38:39.441 --> 38:41.174
How about you and me?

38:41.209 --> 38:42.408
I would,

38:42.444 --> 38:43.977
but there's something
I need to take care of.

38:44.012 --> 38:46.846
I understand.

38:46.881 --> 38:49.549
Louis,
you had the right idea.

38:49.584 --> 38:51.551
The wrong execution.

38:51.586 --> 38:52.752
What do you mean?

38:52.787 --> 38:55.254
I mean, if we're going
to look like a real firm,

38:55.290 --> 38:57.256
then starting tomorrow,
we need to do something

38:57.292 --> 39:00.093
about subletting
these offices.

39:00.128 --> 39:03.062
I'll take care of it.

39:17.915 --> 39:20.149
Can I ask you something?

39:20.184 --> 39:23.152
Sure.

39:23.187 --> 39:26.155
Why'd you come back
with the guard?

39:28.092 --> 39:30.626
Now Gallo knows it was you.

39:30.661 --> 39:33.229
He would have found out
it was me anyway.

39:33.264 --> 39:35.931
But I might not have.

39:35.967 --> 39:39.001
I didn't do it
to get you to forgive me.

39:39.036 --> 39:40.135
I did it 'cause I never
should have

39:40.171 --> 39:43.172
let him in here
in the first place.

39:45.009 --> 39:46.342
What?

39:46.377 --> 39:47.943
I just realized that
I don't even know your name.

39:52.183 --> 39:53.515
Kevin.

39:53.551 --> 39:56.785
Kevin Miller.

39:56.821 --> 39:59.488
Mike Ross.

39:59.523 --> 40:01.490
Thank you, Kevin.

40:04.028 --> 40:07.196
Lights out, gentlemen.

40:22.113 --> 40:24.346
Robert, can I talk to you
for a second?

40:24.382 --> 40:26.048
Yeah, what do you need?

40:26.083 --> 40:27.116
I just found out I'm not
going to be able

40:27.151 --> 40:28.851
to buy in as a partner.

40:28.886 --> 40:31.053
- What?
- I don't have the money.

40:31.088 --> 40:32.388
And I was wondering--

40:32.423 --> 40:34.623
I don't need
a 50-year-old associate, Jack.

40:34.659 --> 40:36.058
I know that.

40:36.093 --> 40:37.860
If you could just let me
pay it off out of my salary.

40:37.895 --> 40:39.828
You know as well as I do,
if I let you do that,

40:39.864 --> 40:41.563
I might as well waive
the buy-in for everyone.

40:41.599 --> 40:42.898
Please, Robert--

40:42.933 --> 40:44.266
Why can't you get a loan
for it?

40:44.302 --> 40:48.070
He can, but it's gonna be
a little complicated.

40:48.105 --> 40:51.040
Because I'm actually
loaning you this money.

40:51.075 --> 40:52.675
And you're gonna loan it
to him,

40:52.710 --> 40:55.244
and if nobody ever repays
anybody,

40:55.279 --> 40:58.781
nobody's gonna give a shit.

40:58.816 --> 41:00.883
Why are you doing this,
Jessica?

41:00.918 --> 41:03.686
Because I'm the one
that got you into this mess.

41:03.721 --> 41:06.288
I should be the one
to get you out.

41:06.324 --> 41:07.956
Thank you.

41:07.992 --> 41:09.325
The truth is, Jack,

41:09.360 --> 41:11.427
the older I get,

41:11.462 --> 41:13.896
the more I'd rather
have friends out there

41:13.931 --> 41:16.765
than enemies.
