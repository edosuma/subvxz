02:19.573 --> 02:20.873
[Jean] <i> I wanted him.</i>

02:22.510 --> 02:24.576
Do you know
that kind of wanting?

02:24.578 --> 02:26.778
The kind that bears
no analysis?

02:26.780 --> 02:30.883
No thought.
Just pure physical.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.486
My body will have this now.

02:35.189 --> 02:36.321
[panting]

02:36.323 --> 02:40.559
<i> My body is me.</i>
<i> Your body is me.</i>

02:40.561 --> 02:42.261
<i> I become we.</i>

02:43.864 --> 02:45.631
<i> It felt like love.</i>

02:45.633 --> 02:48.634
["My Body My Bones"
by Jim and Sam plays]

02:49.236 --> 02:50.602
<i> It was love.</i>

03:00.314 --> 03:02.281
[James] Oh, hey, hey.
Hold on.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.186
Got something for ya.

03:07.188 --> 03:11.323
<i> ¶ Ooh, ooh</i>
<i> ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ¶</i>

03:13.594 --> 03:16.795
<i> ¶ You strike a match</i>
<i> I light the flame ¶</i>

03:16.797 --> 03:18.764
<i> ¶ I'd die for you ¶</i>

03:20.467 --> 03:23.535
<i> -¶ Falling on my weak ¶</i>
-[James] Mott. [claps, whistles]

03:23.537 --> 03:25.470
<i> ¶ And willing knees</i>
<i> To the ground ¶</i>

03:25.472 --> 03:26.939
<i> ¶ Hands to my chest ¶</i>

03:26.941 --> 03:29.541
<i> ¶ You showed me how ¶</i>

03:29.543 --> 03:34.947
<i> ¶ The rumbling in my heart</i>
<i> Goes pound for pound ¶</i>

03:36.584 --> 03:38.250
<i> ¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

03:38.252 --> 03:40.519
<i> ¶ My body, my bones ¶</i>

03:41.455 --> 03:43.755
<i> ¶ You got me by the spine ¶</i>

03:43.757 --> 03:44.856
<i> ¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

03:44.858 --> 03:47.859
<i> ¶ My body, my bones ¶</i>

03:47.861 --> 03:51.563
<i> ¶ Head to my heart</i>
<i> To my waste to my thighs ¶</i>

03:51.565 --> 03:54.866
<i> ¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>
<i> Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ¶</i>

03:58.472 --> 04:02.507
<i> ¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>
<i> Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ¶</i>

04:04.912 --> 04:08.347
<i> ¶ I used to jump</i>
<i> On and off trains ¶</i>

04:08.349 --> 04:10.449
<i> ¶ I'd never stay ¶</i>

04:11.885 --> 04:16.654
<i> ¶ Long enough for them</i>
<i> To know my names on a grave ¶</i>

04:16.656 --> 04:20.559
<i> ¶ Tattooed in time</i>
<i> You showed me how ¶</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:23.929
<i>¶ The rumbling in my heart... ¶</i>

04:23.931 --> 04:25.497
Morning, how are you?

04:25.499 --> 04:28.033
Can I have those apples?
Thank you. Those'll be great.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.604
<i> ¶ My body, my bones ¶</i>

04:32.606 --> 04:34.439
<i> ¶ You got me by the spine ¶</i>

04:34.441 --> 04:36.575
[Jean] <i> I didn't believe</i>
<i> in soul mates. But...</i>

04:36.577 --> 04:38.277
-[produce seller] This too?
-Yeah.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.645
<i> ...what we had</i>
<i> felt other worldly</i>

04:39.647 --> 04:41.346
<i> in a way that overtook me</i>

04:41.348 --> 04:44.616
<i> at a time that I wanted</i>
<i> to be overtaken.</i>

04:48.489 --> 04:51.290
<i> But I don't live</i>
<i> in another world.</i>

04:52.359 --> 04:53.892
<i> I live in this one.</i>

05:04.772 --> 05:08.607
-Chrysanthemum floris folium.
-Semper Fi.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.543
I thought
we were shouting things.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.844
No, Theodore,

05:12.846 --> 05:15.514
the Gordon to English
translation here is mums.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.949
Must have been
some line at the supermarket.

05:17.951 --> 05:21.386
It's a hearty little plant,
the Chrysanthemum.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.587
Of course, this time of year

05:22.589 --> 05:23.889
those are the ones
you typically see.

05:23.891 --> 05:27.659
But it's a surprisingly
diverse genus.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.762
I mean, in the U.S., we think
of it as a cheerful flower.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.731
But in some countries, it...

05:32.733 --> 05:35.434
It's entwined with lamentation.
Grief.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.537
And still others,
it represents honesty.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.806
At any rate, they're lovely.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.909
You get them
at the produce market?

05:43.911 --> 05:45.911
[Jean] Mm-hmm.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.912
Well, I could have gotten you
flowers for free from work.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.948
[Jean] I suppose you could have.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.351
Otis, you're getting syrup
on your math book.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.685
The pages will get stuck.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.354
It's fine.
I've already read it.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.089
Well, it'll sink through
to the other chapters.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.391
I read them all.
And I did the assignments.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.992
[Theodore]
Hey, Ot. Check this out.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.494
You're going to like this.

06:02.496 --> 06:05.497
Now, do you know
who Johann Sebastian Bach is?

06:05.499 --> 06:08.066
-Yes, Grandpa.
-Of course he does.

06:08.068 --> 06:11.470
You show him
your commemorative medals...

06:11.472 --> 06:13.805
-[phone beeps]
-...every single day.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.707
-[Priscilla] What?
-[Jean] What is it, honey?

06:15.709 --> 06:17.843
Priscilla,
I have book club today.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.145
So, don't even think
about taking...

06:20.147 --> 06:21.947
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

06:21.949 --> 06:23.382
...the car.

06:23.384 --> 06:26.752
There's nothing
on the calendar about book club.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.754
Hey.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.825
Happy Boss's Day, boss.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.193
Oh.
[chuckles]

07:08.195 --> 07:12.464
Hey, well, bonsai. Fantastic.

07:12.466 --> 07:16.701
You know, um, the bonsai dates
back as far as the early times

07:16.703 --> 07:18.103
of the Egyptian cultures.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.105
Although,
most associate it with Japan

07:20.107 --> 07:22.574
and the concept of wabi-sabi.

07:22.576 --> 07:26.611
Familiar with wabi-sabi, right?
No?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.214
Oh, well, it mostly
has to do with the, um,

07:29.216 --> 07:31.917
I guess the appreciation
of the transience of things.

07:31.919 --> 07:36.154
Um, and on that account,
um, it's kind of surprising

07:36.156 --> 07:38.790
that the bonsai gained any
popularity at all in America,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.659
given our throw away culture.

07:41.628 --> 07:42.828
You're welcome.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.529
[chuckles]

07:53.740 --> 07:55.006
[James]
<i> I was showing my students</i>

07:55.008 --> 07:57.426
<i> how to make blackout poems,</i>

07:57.427 --> 07:59.845
<i> and I realized all these</i>
<i> love poems are about you.</i>

07:59.847 --> 08:03.181
<i> From your body,</i>
<i> time runs inside us.</i>

08:03.183 --> 08:06.184
<i> Night, space, earth passes.</i>

08:06.186 --> 08:07.752
<i> A vague sound.</i>

08:08.655 --> 08:10.822
<i> In your soul joy is born.</i>

08:10.824 --> 08:13.191
<i> With the kiss of love.</i>

08:13.193 --> 08:16.561
<i> -Your breast, your lust.</i>
-[Vivian] <i> Jean,</i>

08:16.563 --> 08:18.864
<i> Theo's gone outside again.</i>

08:21.502 --> 08:22.567
Shit.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.772
Priscilla?
Just forget that guy.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.941
You know I never liked him.
Kyle's a douche.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.110
I saw him talking
to Lindsey Halgerson

08:32.111 --> 08:33.778
at Chipotle last week.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.780
[groans]
While we were still together?

08:37.650 --> 08:38.850
She's not even pretty.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.986
[Danielle] I just think
she's a shady bitch.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.788
You don't talk to someone's
boyfriend at Chipotle.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.524
Well, she does work there.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.309
Whatever. Danielle's right.

08:47.310 --> 08:49.093
It's not cool. You don't talk
to someone else's boyfriend.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.061
She's a bitch.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.964
Uh, hey. Um...

08:52.966 --> 08:54.566
are any of you
possibly interested

08:54.568 --> 08:56.234
in trying out
for a new reality show?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.136
[Ashley] You're really from TV?

08:58.138 --> 09:01.006
Yup, it is totally legit.

09:01.008 --> 09:04.009
-Cool! What's it about?
-Well, uh,

09:04.011 --> 09:06.978
full details are confidential
until production begins.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.181
But it's fun. Female centric.
An ensemble cast.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.784
Yeah, right now
we're bringing in people

09:12.786 --> 09:14.252
who look interesting.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.689
Basically we're looking for
someone with a sort of, uh...

09:17.691 --> 09:19.691
-quality. Yeah.
-Yeah, vibe.

09:19.693 --> 09:20.992
[producer] Just follow the link
on the website

09:20.994 --> 09:22.561
for audition details.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.063
Uh, do we need to prepare
a monologue or something?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.631
[producer 2 laughs]

09:26.633 --> 09:29.000
-Adorbs. Uh, no.
-Adorbs.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.736
No monologue required.
Just-- Just be yourself.

09:31.738 --> 09:32.837
[producer]
You just be you, okay?

09:32.839 --> 09:34.139
[producer 2] Okay.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.674
Sure.
[chuckles]

09:37.678 --> 09:39.711
[laughter]

10:08.942 --> 10:11.209
[Gordon] <i> Whereas, uh, tubule</i>
<i> is a Lebanese mountain dish,</i>

10:11.211 --> 10:16.147
although there are Armenian
and, uh, Turkish variations,

10:16.149 --> 10:18.717
but that's more parsley
than bulgur.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.818
[Trudy] Gordon?

10:23.256 --> 10:24.656
Gordon Copeland?

10:24.658 --> 10:28.226
-[both chuckle]
-I thought it was you.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.195
I'm sorry,
do we know each other?

10:30.197 --> 10:31.396
Trudy.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.064
Trudy Parker.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.669
-Trudy.
-Senior year, Ross Hall.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.072
Pitchers of beer.
Darts at the Rec.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.807
Frisbee on the Quad.

10:42.809 --> 10:43.908
[chuckles]

10:43.910 --> 10:45.744
You're kidding, right?

10:46.747 --> 10:48.246
For Valentine's Day,

10:48.248 --> 10:51.149
you gave me a pair
of red-footed pajamas.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.018
I gave you a copy
of <i> Leaves of Grass.</i>

10:53.020 --> 10:54.419
We went to that French place.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.787
On the way back, it rained

10:55.789 --> 10:57.389
so we ducked into that
big cement pipe

10:57.391 --> 10:59.391
'til the rain stopped.

10:59.393 --> 11:03.128
You used to joke that our song
should be...

11:03.130 --> 11:05.997
"Why Don't We Do It
in the Road."

11:06.833 --> 11:08.266
[chuckles]
I...

11:09.236 --> 11:11.236
I had a roommate named Sheila.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.806
-Belly dancing Sheila?
-Yes.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.442
My roommate when you and I dated
for seven months.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.681
I guess you were pretty
distracted by your...

11:22.683 --> 11:28.053
thesis on Italian
Renaissance painting.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.320
Your art history degree.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.794
Oh, yeah, I, um,
I ended up getting a degree

11:35.796 --> 11:38.029
in hospitality management
at Cornell.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.964
Mm. Good for you.

11:40.434 --> 11:41.700
Huh.

11:42.703 --> 11:43.868
[Trudy] Well, then...

11:45.305 --> 11:46.771
take care.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.340
Uh, you too. Trudy.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.344
Trudy...

12:36.223 --> 12:37.422
[bike bell chimes]

12:44.064 --> 12:46.931
I really just
couldn't get into it.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.134
I mean, that Ignatius guy was...

12:49.136 --> 12:50.535
Kind of a hot mess.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.271
Completely unsympathetic.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.441
"Oh, look at me, I'm miserable,

12:56.443 --> 12:59.811
I'm stuck in this shitty town,
I have bad gas."

12:59.813 --> 13:01.179
[laughing]

13:01.181 --> 13:03.815
Well, characters don't always
have to be...

13:03.817 --> 13:05.917
sympathetic to be compelling.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.553
Other thoughts?

13:08.555 --> 13:12.423
What about James?
You, it was your selection.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.460
I'm kind of curious to hear
more about what Jean has to say.

13:19.399 --> 13:25.003
Um, well, this--
This might sound weird,

13:25.005 --> 13:30.175
but I actually can identify
with Ignatius, in a way.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.076
His own mother
wants him committed!

13:33.079 --> 13:34.879
Well, who hasn't
been through that

13:34.881 --> 13:36.381
at one time or another, huh?

13:36.383 --> 13:39.384
-[chuckles]
-[awkward chuckling]

13:39.386 --> 13:42.187
Well, Ignatius feels
powerless in his life,

13:42.189 --> 13:46.291
that he's at the mercy of a fate
that's not really in his favor.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.592
And I've felt that way.

13:51.531 --> 13:55.166
"Those who don't know the nature
and the purpose of things...

13:55.168 --> 14:01.272
think the criminal and wicked
have power and happiness."

14:04.477 --> 14:07.512
It's not in there, Margot.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.881
It's from
<i> Consolation of Philosophy,</i>

14:09.883 --> 14:12.450
the book Ignatius
constantly refers to.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.551
You read <i> Consolation?</i>

14:13.553 --> 14:18.189
Yeah, 6th century philosophers
are my kinda rabbit hole.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.159
I'll take pictures
of the kittens in boxes.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.528
-[laughs]
-I love kittens in boxes!

14:23.530 --> 14:25.363
Oh, my God,
did you see the one

14:25.365 --> 14:27.398
with the kitten and the bunny
in the teacup?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.067
-[Alisa] No!
-[Karen] Okay,

14:29.069 --> 14:32.036
I'm going to show it to you.
You have to see it. So adorable.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.271
Aw.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.441
[Margot] Oh, that's cute.

14:39.346 --> 14:44.048
But then he seems to be saying
that the only thing

14:44.050 --> 14:48.319
of any true value
is found within.

14:48.321 --> 14:52.190
So, in that sense,
happiness is--

14:52.192 --> 14:54.225
You are my happiness.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.130
James. Shh. Shh. Shh.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.168
You are a beautiful
flowering tree.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.907
And I'm a tired bird
looking for my nest.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.008
Oh, James.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.944
It's getting real hard
to share you.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.383
Never mind.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.686
Otis is only nine years old.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.923
And I thought we'd only
be looking after Theo and Vivian

15:24.925 --> 15:25.990
for a little while.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.529
Alzheimer's is so unpredictable.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.231
I can still smell you on me.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.066
[sighs]

15:38.405 --> 15:40.605
There's just a lot of things
to consider, that's all.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.408
It's just real hard.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.111
What's so hard?
[chuckles]

15:47.113 --> 15:52.183
I was just suggesting that
maybe we read a classic.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.952
Something like <i> Moby Dick.</i>

15:53.954 --> 15:56.454
Oh, no, thank you.
[chuckles]

15:57.390 --> 15:58.523
Good call, James.

15:58.525 --> 16:02.093
Some ships sail
from their ports

16:02.095 --> 16:04.696
and are ever afterwards missing.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.573
-He is something.
-Yes.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.641
Mm-hmm.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.278
-Yes, he is.
-Mm.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.649
[Theodore] <i> Let me read you a bit</i>
<i> of my latest optometry paper.</i>

16:24.651 --> 16:27.618
My father was an optometrist.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.754
And was also
in the jewelry business,

16:29.756 --> 16:33.491
as these commerces
were often conjugated

16:33.493 --> 16:36.194
together at that time.

16:36.196 --> 16:41.232
I loved to sit in his chair.
Loved the things of it.

16:41.234 --> 16:45.036
The click
of the giant eye piece.

16:47.107 --> 16:50.641
And the curvature
of the cornea complex as itself

16:50.643 --> 16:53.378
with the elements
to confer the portraits

16:53.380 --> 16:57.081
obtained to the central
nurse's station.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.794
Who's Catrina?

17:10.430 --> 17:11.561
Caterina.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.132
Oh. I see.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.135
Who's Caterina?

17:17.137 --> 17:22.205
A girl I might maybe like.
But probably not.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.175
You know, considering
she's a girl and everything.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.380
Well, that's wonderful.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.583
Tell me about her.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.086
I don't know.
She has two ponytails.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.354
You mean pig tails?

17:38.158 --> 17:39.223
I guess.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.060
What is she like?

17:42.062 --> 17:44.695
She has the neatest cubby
of anyone, ever,

17:44.697 --> 17:48.066
crosses her feet in this
weird way under her desk.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.435
They kind of like wind around.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.071
-Interesting.
-[Otis] That's all I know.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.073
Because she hasn't really
talked to me or anything.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.708
Well, the first boy
I ever liked, Roger,

17:57.710 --> 18:00.611
when I was about your age,

18:00.613 --> 18:02.780
didn't know I existed
for months.

18:02.782 --> 18:06.317
But we eventually
became friends.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.453
And then...

18:09.189 --> 18:10.521
well, you know.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.224
Love is a...

18:15.195 --> 18:16.661
It's a thing, Otie.

18:16.663 --> 18:23.167
It's a thing that isn't always
what you think it might be.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.803
When I first met your father,

18:25.805 --> 18:30.108
I was totally in his thrall,
as they say.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.809
He was so worldly.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.347
Handsome in a certain way
I thought.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.616
And I was so young.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.287
James has reminded me
of a different thing

18:43.289 --> 18:44.489
that love can be.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.658
But Daddy's name is Gordon.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.131
Yes.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.567
Yes, it is.

19:22.795 --> 19:23.861
[sighs]

19:28.735 --> 19:29.800
Doris.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.240
Hey, hypothetical scenario.

19:36.242 --> 19:38.676
Say you're approached by someone

19:38.678 --> 19:40.645
claiming to have a history
with you.

19:40.647 --> 19:45.283
The details of which are both
specific and believable

19:45.285 --> 19:48.786
and you still have
no recollection of those things

19:48.788 --> 19:51.422
and that person being connected,

19:51.424 --> 19:54.492
due to the fact that you have
no recollection of that person.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.527
Happens all the time.

19:56.529 --> 20:00.531
That's just...
CRS is what that is.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.335
Can't remember shit.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.206
[chuckles]
Right.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.307
[door closes]

20:10.743 --> 20:12.610
[indistinct chatter]

20:27.794 --> 20:29.894
-Want these?
-Huh?

20:29.896 --> 20:32.930
All that's left are pomegranate,
birthday cake, and jalapeño.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.533
Hold out your hand.

20:40.673 --> 20:41.739
Thanks.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.249
[murmuring]

20:55.655 --> 20:57.822
"What was I about to do-- "
Nope.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.957
"How often do you end up
double booking yourself?"

20:59.959 --> 21:01.859
Why would I do that?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.027
Ridiculous.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.997
"How often do you have to ask
someone to repeat instructions

21:05.999 --> 21:07.365
or story because..."

21:07.967 --> 21:09.667
[mumbling]

21:10.570 --> 21:12.270
[clicking]

21:17.777 --> 21:21.879
[Vivian] <i> Oh, Theodore, what have</i>
<i> you done with the can opener?</i>

21:26.419 --> 21:28.686
I just like to see
how things work is all?

21:28.688 --> 21:30.488
Yes. But you never remember

21:30.490 --> 21:31.956
how to put them back
together again.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.425
What do you mean? I remember
how to put them ba...

21:34.427 --> 21:38.996
All right. There's a manual one
in the drawer, Grandmother.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.700
This morning, I caught him
going out by himself again.

21:42.702 --> 21:47.004
Determined to photograph
some mangy squirrel.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.809
I always thought about
a career in photography.

21:52.612 --> 21:53.577
Or music.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.881
Not that I have any regrets.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.651
Hey, what does your father do
for a living?

22:03.523 --> 22:04.822
He was an optometrist.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.691
An optometrist?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.493
I was an optometrist.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.797
You are my father.

22:15.601 --> 22:18.369
Oh. Yes.
[chuckles]

22:21.874 --> 22:24.575
[Jean] <i> If you could have seen</i>
<i>the way he clutched the handful</i>

22:24.577 --> 22:27.511
of jellybeans
that little girl gave him today.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.048
And who gave him
the jellybeans?

22:31.050 --> 22:32.983
Her name is Caterina.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.388
Oh, right, Caterina.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.458
You know her?

22:40.927 --> 22:41.992
Of course.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.364
When did you meet her? Has she--

22:46.366 --> 22:48.399
Or has she been to the house?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.837
Oh, you know what, you're right.
I don't.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.107
I don't know
what I was thinking.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.076
Well, I certainly wouldn't know.

23:02.782 --> 23:03.981
They're Turkish.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.920
Jellybeans,
they're Turkish in origin.

23:11.391 --> 23:14.091
The Turks they take
these jellies and they...

23:16.162 --> 23:18.929
well, they threw them
in a hard--

23:19.966 --> 23:22.867
[groans]
I'm-- I'm sorry.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.535
-It's all right.
-I'm so sorry.

23:25.671 --> 23:26.737
[Gordon] It's okay.

23:28.841 --> 23:29.907
[Jean] Oh, God.

23:38.818 --> 23:39.884
[sighs]

23:42.522 --> 23:43.921
[phone beeps]

23:43.923 --> 23:45.189
Job description.

23:45.191 --> 23:49.593
I'm supposed to somehow
take this cheap shit

23:49.595 --> 23:50.895
and turn it into an outfit

23:50.897 --> 23:53.597
I'm not totally mortified
to wear.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.499
Not possible.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.101
What? Mom!

23:57.103 --> 24:00.138
What are you doing?

24:00.139 --> 24:03.174
I'm pretty much about to be cast
in my own major reality show.

24:03.176 --> 24:05.576
-[sighs]
-This is serious.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.812
Okay. I can't wear
just any shitty outfit.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.047
And I can't sound stupid.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.183
I need to focus so that
this doesn't get fucked up

24:12.185 --> 24:13.684
like everything else
around here.

24:14.654 --> 24:15.719
[sighs]

24:31.504 --> 24:34.672
[James] <i> Hey, babe,</i>
<i> just thinking about you hard.</i>

24:35.208 --> 24:36.640
<i> Missing you.</i>

24:38.177 --> 24:40.744
<i> Are you there? Hello?</i>

24:40.746 --> 24:44.582
<i> Okay. I guess you're busy.</i>
<i> I get it.</i>

24:46.252 --> 24:49.119
<i> So wishing you were in my arms</i>
<i> right now.</i>

24:49.121 --> 24:51.755
<i> Here, anywhere.</i>

24:51.757 --> 24:54.191
<i> Had a day and a night.</i>

24:54.927 --> 24:55.993
<i> It's fine.</i>

24:57.530 --> 24:59.096
<i> Mott misses you, too.</i>

25:06.606 --> 25:09.106
<i> To the sound of your sweet</i>
<i> butter voice when you laugh</i>

25:09.108 --> 25:10.908
<i> because his big dumb face</i>
<i> looked like</i>

25:10.910 --> 25:13.177
<i> he was trying to tell us</i>
<i> what he thought was a squirrel</i>

25:13.179 --> 25:15.145
<i>turned out to be just the wind.</i>
<i> Remember that?</i>

25:15.147 --> 25:16.847
<i> I mean, you'd probably</i>
<i> never forget that.</i>

25:16.849 --> 25:18.682
<i> Still, I was</i>
<i> retro-actively worried</i>

25:18.684 --> 25:20.518
<i> almost as though</i>
<i> it could happen again.</i>

25:20.520 --> 25:21.819
<i> If you know my mind.</i>

25:50.983 --> 25:52.116
James!

26:13.339 --> 26:14.605
[sighs]

26:22.214 --> 26:23.814
[Jean] <i> I'm sorry.</i>

26:23.816 --> 26:27.985
<i> I went to the worst place</i>
<i> I could conceive of.</i>

26:27.987 --> 26:29.787
<i> He's breaking it off.</i>

26:29.789 --> 26:31.956
<i> Oh, my God, he's leaving me.</i>

26:31.958 --> 26:34.658
<i> It's like I was in one</i>
<i> of those nightmares</i>

26:34.660 --> 26:36.694
<i> where you know</i>
<i> you're having a nightmare</i>

26:36.696 --> 26:38.195
<i> and you force yourself</i>
<i> to wake up</i>

26:38.197 --> 26:42.032
<i> only to realize that's also</i>
<i> part of a nightmare.</i>

27:08.127 --> 27:09.193
[sobs]

27:10.329 --> 27:11.662
What is it?

27:12.932 --> 27:13.998
Jean?

27:16.702 --> 27:17.935
[Jean sniffs]

27:17.937 --> 27:20.070
He was in my book club.

27:21.374 --> 27:24.241
Oh, that's terrible.
Had he been sick?

27:24.243 --> 27:26.276
It says it appears...

27:27.713 --> 27:30.014
that he took his own life.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.248
Oh.

27:32.385 --> 27:35.753
Well, it's, uh, well-known,

27:35.755 --> 27:37.988
there's a high rate
of suicide among artists.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.758
But suicides
can often be prevented.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.426
They say there are
almost always signs.

27:42.428 --> 27:45.329
Are you saying
I should have known?

27:45.331 --> 27:46.397
No.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.966
No.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.434
I'm sure you probably didn't
know him all that well.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.342
[knock on door]

28:32.344 --> 28:33.343
[Gordon] <i> Jean?</i>

28:34.914 --> 28:36.714
<i>Jean, everything okay in there?</i>

28:36.716 --> 28:40.751
[Jean]
<i>And that's when I realized, no.</i>

28:41.454 --> 28:44.455
<i> Everything is not okay.</i>

28:45.958 --> 28:47.858
<i> It's not okay at all.</i>

29:08.914 --> 29:11.882
[Jean] But I certainly
couldn't tell him that.

29:12.818 --> 29:13.884
[Claire] Who?

29:15.454 --> 29:16.520
Sorry?

29:16.522 --> 29:21.191
Who couldn't you tell
that everything wasn't okay?

29:23.195 --> 29:24.995
My husband of 20 years.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.064
Because he just hung himself
with a belt.

29:27.533 --> 29:28.799
Oh.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.775
-Sorry.
-Well, I'm sorry.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.376
Should I not share
the specifics?

29:39.378 --> 29:41.845
I don't really know
how this works.

29:41.847 --> 29:44.448
The way this works
is we share everything here.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.017
We're only as sick
as our secrets.

29:47.019 --> 29:51.155
Denial is
the first phase of grief.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.559
I didn't even call
an ambulance 'til Mary Louise

29:55.561 --> 29:57.261
had been dead for two days.

29:59.064 --> 30:02.466
Took me weeks to admit
that my partner, Ellen,

30:02.468 --> 30:05.936
didn't swallow 80 Vicodin
by accident.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.406
[social worker]
We don't get 100% honest,

30:09.408 --> 30:12.242
we're never going to get through
what we need to get through.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.111
And move our lives forward.

30:22.288 --> 30:25.823
House, apple, boat, dog, kite.

30:26.458 --> 30:27.524
What?

30:27.526 --> 30:30.194
Just try to remember
those words.

30:30.196 --> 30:33.030
Oh, house, apple,
boat, dog, kite.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.364
[Dr. Worland]
Just try to remember them.

30:34.366 --> 30:37.334
Okay.
This is hereditary, isn't it?

30:37.336 --> 30:39.469
Well, there is a familial
genetic mutation

30:39.471 --> 30:40.938
associated with Alzheimer's.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.207
Yeah. I knew it. I...

30:45.110 --> 30:47.411
I can't end up
like my father. I won't.

30:47.413 --> 30:50.147
The tests show you don't have
that genetic marker.

30:50.549 --> 30:51.899
I don't.

30:51.900 --> 30:53.250
[Dr. Worland]
The scan didn't identify

30:53.252 --> 30:55.085
any significant Amyloid Plax.

30:55.087 --> 30:58.455
Well, significant.
It doesn't say there are none.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.290
The presence of Plax alone

31:00.292 --> 31:02.192
can't be used
to diagnose Alzheimer's.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.995
It's not uncommon
for people to have Plax.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.864
No cognitive symptoms.

31:06.866 --> 31:08.432
So, you can't rule it out.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.901
Could do a spinal tap.

31:10.903 --> 31:13.604
Nothing in your exam indicates
it's warranted.

31:13.606 --> 31:16.540
A lot of things
can affect memory.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.176
Sleep issues.
Stress. Depression.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.578
A dead, sexless marriage

31:21.580 --> 31:26.083
leading to abject loneliness
and existential disassociation.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.118
What?

31:28.120 --> 31:30.888
I said is everything okay
at home?

31:30.890 --> 31:31.955
Oh!

31:31.957 --> 31:35.626
Uh, yeah, you know, well, these
things go in cycles, you know.

31:35.628 --> 31:38.462
[Dr. Worland] All right.
Now, tell me those five words

31:38.464 --> 31:39.663
I asked you to remember.

31:39.665 --> 31:45.102
Uh, house, apple,
uh, boat, dog, car.

31:45.638 --> 31:48.605
No. Uh, cat. No.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.642
It's fine.
Four out of five is common.

31:51.644 --> 31:54.478
Wait, no, I got a house,
apple, boat...

31:55.915 --> 31:57.147
dog...

31:59.952 --> 32:02.986
Excuse me,
I have another appointment.

32:02.988 --> 32:08.125
Thank you.
Um, apple, boat, dog...

32:09.662 --> 32:12.462
[laughter]

32:12.464 --> 32:13.563
[door opens]

32:16.936 --> 32:19.603
Oh, my God.
That was so much fun.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.071
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.373
Priscilla Copeland.

32:23.375 --> 32:26.343
Dude, it's easy.
Just don't be boring.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.657
-Hi
-[Priscilla] Hi.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.225
Hi. Yeah.

32:43.362 --> 32:46.063
Uh, Priscilla.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.699
We're just going to ask you
a couple of general questions.

32:48.701 --> 32:51.034
Get an idea for how
you look on camera.

32:51.036 --> 32:53.537
Try and cheat your answers here
toward camera if you can.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.339
But just try and be natural.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.473
Yeah, totally.

32:56.475 --> 32:57.441
[producer] And, remember,
there are no

32:57.443 --> 32:58.642
right or wrong answers.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.011
So don't worry about that.

33:01.012 --> 33:03.379
We really do just want you
to be yourself. Okay?

33:03.382 --> 33:08.385
So, first question.
What is your level of education?

33:08.387 --> 33:11.755
Well, I'm in my first year
of junior college.

33:11.757 --> 33:14.491
But I kind of hate it.
I'm thinking about dropping out.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.592
[chuckles]

33:17.629 --> 33:21.298
Well, I mean, but maybe not.

33:22.001 --> 33:24.001
Um, I don't know.

33:24.003 --> 33:27.371
What do you think's
your best quality as a person?

33:28.640 --> 33:30.741
My style is great.
[laughs]

33:30.743 --> 33:32.109
Any hobbies?

33:32.111 --> 33:34.711
What, like, stamp collecting
or something?

33:34.713 --> 33:36.646
Yeah, yeah, like that.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.382
Is texting a hobby?

33:39.184 --> 33:40.784
Not really.

33:40.786 --> 33:45.255
Oh. I love to dance.
And I like fashion magazines.

33:46.592 --> 33:49.426
All right, why don't we move on.

33:49.428 --> 33:53.463
Have you experienced
or been treated for any mental

33:53.465 --> 33:56.199
or physical illness
within the past ten years?

33:56.201 --> 34:00.070
What? No, ten years ago
I was, like, nine.

34:00.072 --> 34:02.305
Nine-year-olds
can have mental illness.

34:02.307 --> 34:05.675
Well, that must be what's wrong
with my brother then.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.811
[laughter]

34:09.081 --> 34:10.431
[clears throat]

34:10.431 --> 34:11.782
Have you ever been
on television before?

34:11.784 --> 34:15.118
Uh, I went to New York
with my family one time.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.521
And we stood outside
the <i> Today Show.</i>

34:17.523 --> 34:19.656
But we were all the way
in the back.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.123
It was lame.

34:22.393 --> 34:25.395
What's your primary motivation
for being on TV?

34:25.397 --> 34:28.165
Doesn't everyone wanna be on TV?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.100
Not everyone.

34:30.101 --> 34:34.504
What accomplishment
are you most proud of?

34:39.645 --> 34:41.110
[Hal] <i> It's just that I, uh...</i>

34:42.714 --> 34:45.148
I looked up to him so much.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.716
In spite of his illness.

34:46.717 --> 34:49.351
He was always
such a good brother.

34:49.353 --> 34:52.755
I thought
that after that first time,

34:52.757 --> 34:54.524
you know, it was so long ago.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.092
That he tried to, uh...

34:57.296 --> 34:58.695
I thought he was doing better.

34:58.697 --> 35:01.164
That the new medication was...

35:05.604 --> 35:07.504
I just thought
he was doing better.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.209
[sniffs]
Anyway, I've said enough.

35:12.211 --> 35:15.846
Is there anybody else
who'd like to say something?

35:16.748 --> 35:19.282
Anybody? Sure.

35:19.751 --> 35:20.817
Come here.

35:25.157 --> 35:29.626
Uh, I guess I just wanted
to say that...

35:30.629 --> 35:33.163
Mr. D was nice to everybody.

35:33.165 --> 35:36.233
Even if your art wasn't so hot.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.368
He made you feel
like it was.

35:38.370 --> 35:42.706
He made you see
how it could connect people.

35:42.708 --> 35:46.910
And, you know, change you.
And I won't ever forget that.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.147
Thank you.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.187
Oh, and, uh,

35:57.189 --> 36:01.625
if anybody would like
a really big, sweet, old dog,

36:01.627 --> 36:03.527
Mott's gonna need a new home.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.762
The wife's allergic, so...

36:05.764 --> 36:10.433
Anyway, thank you all for coming
and celebrating James's life.

36:11.837 --> 36:12.903
Hey, buddy.

36:14.473 --> 36:17.374
-I'm so sorry for your loss.
-[Hal] Um...

36:17.376 --> 36:19.943
I'm, um...
I'm a friend of James.

36:19.945 --> 36:23.380
He was in my book club.

36:23.382 --> 36:26.316
I-- I'd be happy
to take the dog.

36:26.318 --> 36:27.417
My son would love him.

36:27.419 --> 36:28.818
-Really?
-Yeah.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.387
I mean, that's amazing.

36:30.389 --> 36:31.721
Are you s-- Are you sure?

36:31.723 --> 36:32.789
Yeah.

36:33.926 --> 36:35.192
Okay.

36:45.437 --> 36:46.803
[Hal] Okay, I mean,

36:46.805 --> 36:49.639
just, you know, let me know
when's good for you.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.508
I can get his stuff
and get it up here to you.

36:51.510 --> 36:52.676
Well, I can take him now.

36:52.678 --> 36:53.777
Really?

36:54.513 --> 36:55.579
Yeah.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.447
Oh.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.717
Come on. Come on.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.816
[Jean] Aw. I know.

37:32.818 --> 37:34.918
You're very sad.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.486
You're lonely.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.956
You want to come up in our bed?

37:39.958 --> 37:42.659
No, no, no.
He stays in his bed.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.694
Well, I think he's traumatized.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.731
But in our bed?

37:47.733 --> 37:49.899
-Oh.
-[dog panting]

37:49.901 --> 37:52.869
It's not like it makes
any difference. Does it?

37:52.871 --> 37:54.771
[dog panting]

37:54.773 --> 37:56.273
Good boy.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.616
What if we talk about
all the things on the list

38:06.618 --> 38:08.752
before we even get
to the apple orchard?

38:08.754 --> 38:10.654
[Jean] Oh, Otie.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.290
Sweetie, you don't need a list.

38:13.292 --> 38:17.761
You don't always have to talk
when you have someone special.

38:19.031 --> 38:21.931
James and I have moments
like that all the time.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.801
We had wonderful conversations.

38:24.803 --> 38:29.372
But half the time,
we didn't even have to talk.

38:29.374 --> 38:32.442
We could just...
sit there together.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.912
Love is a beautiful thing, Otie.

38:37.316 --> 38:40.850
Someday, you'll come together
with a person.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.388
And a very almost...

38:46.525 --> 38:48.825
spiritual thing will happen.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.493
I don't know how else to say it.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.866
Hopefully your lover
won't kill herself.

39:03.108 --> 39:04.974
I already have
the salon center

39:04.976 --> 39:07.077
and the pink styling chair
for my American Girl doll.

39:07.079 --> 39:09.779
And Caterina, if you have
an American Girl doll,

39:09.781 --> 39:12.015
you can bring her over
for a play date anytime.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.650
And we can play salon.

39:13.652 --> 39:14.984
I don't.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.487
[teacher] Okay, Bethany,
time to get on the bus now.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.456
[Bethany] Well, that's okay,

39:19.458 --> 39:20.924
you can bring
whatever doll you have

39:20.926 --> 39:23.727
as long as it's littler
than an American Girl doll,

39:23.729 --> 39:25.729
I mean, it would be better
if you had one,

39:25.731 --> 39:29.366
but, still, you could even bring
a Barbie or an Ariel

39:29.368 --> 39:31.034
or a La La Lucy or a Gotz.

39:31.036 --> 39:33.069
Well, a Gotz might be too big.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.672
But, still, even
if you can't fit the chair.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.774
It can still sit next to mine
and just talk to her

39:37.776 --> 39:39.109
while she's sitting there.

39:39.111 --> 39:40.810
I don't want to sit next
to the window

39:40.812 --> 39:43.012
-in case it crashes.
-Is that better in a crash?

39:43.014 --> 39:45.331
Sitting in the middle?

39:45.332 --> 39:47.649
I think so. Have you ever seen
the old movie,<i> Speed?</i>

39:48.687 --> 39:50.653
Very, very scary.

39:50.655 --> 39:53.022
It's about a bus
that never stops.

39:53.024 --> 39:55.658
Well, I think
this bus will stop.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.660
I hope so.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.897
Do you ever think
that you'll kill yourself?

40:00.899 --> 40:03.099
I don't think so.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.868
Why, do you?

40:04.870 --> 40:07.170
No, but my mom said
that's what lovers do.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.172
On purpose you mean?

40:09.174 --> 40:10.774
I guess.

40:10.776 --> 40:14.411
Then no. If I killed myself,
it'd only be an accident.

40:14.413 --> 40:16.112
Do you like crossword puzzles?

40:16.114 --> 40:17.881
I don't know.
I like spelling.

40:17.883 --> 40:20.450
[Otis] Oh, well, I like
to make crossword puzzles.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.525
That was my first one.

40:29.828 --> 40:30.894
Cool.

40:39.571 --> 40:40.770
[Gordon] Trudy...

40:41.940 --> 40:43.173
Um...

40:44.843 --> 40:45.909
Uh...

40:47.045 --> 40:48.478
there we go.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.815
Dear Trudy,

40:53.084 --> 40:57.487
I hope you will accept
my sincere apology

40:57.489 --> 41:02.826
for having forgotten
our entire relationship.

41:02.828 --> 41:03.893
No.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.831
For not remembering you.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.065
[sighs]

41:10.535 --> 41:13.036
I'm sorry,

41:13.038 --> 41:17.941
I did not
recognize you at the store.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.844
Yeah. Shit.

41:20.846 --> 41:24.047
Can we meet so that
you can tell me

41:24.049 --> 41:25.815
that I haven't lost
my fucking mind.

41:26.251 --> 41:27.517
Dumb.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.986
Can we meet for coffee?

41:29.988 --> 41:34.958
Can we meet for coffee?

41:40.699 --> 41:41.798
Jesus.

41:48.073 --> 41:49.138
Oh, man.

41:53.078 --> 41:54.143
[sighs]

42:03.555 --> 42:04.854
[unzips]

42:04.856 --> 42:05.922
Ah.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.626
Ah.

42:12.797 --> 42:13.997
[intercom beeps]

42:13.999 --> 42:15.865
[man]
<i> Gordon to the front, please.</i>

42:15.867 --> 42:17.166
<i> Gordon to the front.</i>

42:17.168 --> 42:19.536
[moans]

42:29.314 --> 42:33.683
You tell people things
when you are intimate.

42:33.685 --> 42:35.552
When you are in love.

42:35.554 --> 42:37.620
When you are we you share

42:37.622 --> 42:40.857
that you've been fighting
mental health issues for years.

42:40.859 --> 42:43.826
That the new medication
is actually not working.

42:43.828 --> 42:46.162
That it's all getting
to be too much.

42:46.164 --> 42:48.031
And you're thinking
bad thoughts.

42:48.033 --> 42:50.833
Very, very bad thoughts
and you need help.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.604
I know it seems personal.

42:54.606 --> 42:56.339
Well, of course it's personal.

42:56.341 --> 43:00.610
I'm the one he left.
How is that not personal?

43:02.681 --> 43:04.080
I was left, too.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.848
We've all been left.

43:05.850 --> 43:08.785
One way or another. Right?

43:08.787 --> 43:11.854
[Claire] I just can't believe
your husband was able to hide

43:11.856 --> 43:14.223
his mental illness from you
for so many years.

43:14.225 --> 43:16.225
Oh, yeah, well...

43:16.227 --> 43:18.261
You know, a lot of things
can go unnoticed

43:18.263 --> 43:19.929
in a marriage over the years.

43:21.967 --> 43:24.300
I'm just trying to help.

43:24.302 --> 43:28.037
It's okay. No, you be mad.

43:28.039 --> 43:31.774
Not doing anybody any good
to bottle it all up.

43:31.776 --> 43:35.678
Anger is the next phase
of grief.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.015
Really?

43:39.651 --> 43:40.850
And then what?

43:43.254 --> 43:45.622
Serenity, joy,

43:45.624 --> 43:48.725
the happy fucking kumbaya
acceptance?

43:48.727 --> 43:51.761
That it was all meant to be.

43:51.763 --> 43:54.864
Because I would trade
a lifetime of serenity

43:54.866 --> 43:56.666
for one more afternoon

43:56.668 --> 43:58.334
lying on the blanket
in the grass with him.

43:58.336 --> 43:59.736
One more hour.

44:01.740 --> 44:03.006
Bargaining.

44:03.008 --> 44:04.073
What?

44:05.810 --> 44:06.876
Bargaining.

44:08.013 --> 44:09.779
It's the next phase.

44:13.785 --> 44:16.285
Thank you, but I don't think
this is for me.

44:16.287 --> 44:19.122
None of this
is gonna bring him back.

44:19.124 --> 44:21.057
[social worker]
You tell people things.

44:21.059 --> 44:25.194
When everything is not okay,
you make sure you tell somebody.

44:29.801 --> 44:33.302
[indistinct chatter]

44:51.956 --> 44:53.222
[teacher] All right, listen up.

44:53.224 --> 44:55.992
When you've each gathered
a full bag of apples

44:55.994 --> 44:57.960
please sit at the bottom
of your tree

44:57.962 --> 44:59.929
with your buddy, okay?

45:09.274 --> 45:10.907
[Otis] <i> Do you like robots?</i>

45:10.909 --> 45:13.176
-Robots?
-Never mind.

45:14.112 --> 45:15.745
Don't you like apples?

45:15.747 --> 45:17.947
[Caterina] Yeah,
but I don't like spots on them?

45:17.949 --> 45:20.049
Like from worms and stuff.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.035
Well, me neither.

45:22.036 --> 45:24.020
So you probably don't like bugs
then if you don't like worms.

45:24.022 --> 45:25.221
[sighs]

45:28.126 --> 45:30.193
Hey, I brought jellybeans.
Wants some?

45:30.195 --> 45:31.260
Sure.

45:36.968 --> 45:39.268
So birthday cake isn't so good,
right?

45:39.270 --> 45:41.904
You don't like birthday cake?
Not even chocolate?

45:41.906 --> 45:43.239
Oh, I love birthday cake.

45:43.241 --> 45:44.774
I meant birthday cake
jellybeans.

45:44.776 --> 45:46.275
Oh, oh, good.

45:46.277 --> 45:48.211
Then you can still come
to my birthday party.

45:48.213 --> 45:49.846
[Otis] Sure.

45:49.848 --> 45:51.314
But if you come
to my birthday party,

45:51.316 --> 45:53.349
you'll have to be my boyfriend.

46:12.437 --> 46:13.803
Dad.

46:15.340 --> 46:16.405
Dad.

46:17.842 --> 46:19.308
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.177
What are you doing?

46:21.179 --> 46:23.412
Well, I have to get my paper
to the post office.

46:23.414 --> 46:27.550
Okay. Um, the mail's
already gone out today

46:27.552 --> 46:30.019
and I think you're gonna need
an envelope.

46:38.263 --> 46:40.163
[knocks on door]

46:44.169 --> 46:46.102
[Claire] Hi, um, is Jean home?

46:46.104 --> 46:48.471
Oh, no, no, not at the moment.

46:48.473 --> 46:50.006
Can I help you?

46:50.008 --> 46:52.809
She left this book at our group.

46:52.811 --> 46:55.044
The address was in it so I--

46:55.046 --> 46:59.115
Oh, I will make sure
that she gets it, thank you.

47:01.352 --> 47:04.187
I'm sorry, I'm rude.
It's just my father, um...

47:04.189 --> 47:06.856
I'm Gordon, Jean's husband.

47:06.858 --> 47:08.124
[clatters]

47:09.194 --> 47:10.960
I'm sorry. I...
[chuckles]

47:10.962 --> 47:13.429
I really got to go,
but thanks again.

47:16.868 --> 47:19.235
-[clatters]
-Oh, God.

47:19.237 --> 47:20.269
Dad?

47:27.912 --> 47:30.413
Oh. Fun fact.

47:30.415 --> 47:34.350
Spite and Malice is sometimes
called Cat and Mouse.

47:35.286 --> 47:37.486
So on the bus,
Caterina told me

47:37.488 --> 47:40.122
she sits on the inside
in case it crashes.

47:40.124 --> 47:41.357
She has a fear of it.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.960
Well, I have a fear of crashing.

47:43.962 --> 47:47.196
Sometimes I'm afraid
of running people down.

47:47.198 --> 47:49.098
I didn't know that,
Grandma Bibbie.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.566
[Vivian] You know I don't drive.

47:50.568 --> 47:54.203
I've never driven.
It would be terrible if I did.

47:54.205 --> 47:56.305
Can I ask a question?

47:56.307 --> 47:59.008
Absolutely, daughter. You know
what they say about questions.

47:59.010 --> 48:04.313
Do you guys all have,
like, a proudest accomplishment?

48:06.017 --> 48:09.452
Well, for me, it would
probably be in my painting.

48:09.454 --> 48:12.355
Huh? I didn't know
you were into painting.

48:12.357 --> 48:14.156
I studied it in college.

48:14.158 --> 48:15.992
You took one class.

48:15.994 --> 48:20.162
I feel like
I learned what I needed to.

48:20.164 --> 48:23.432
About me, what should I begin.

48:23.434 --> 48:27.003
Let's see, oh, yes.
I'm a college graduate.

48:27.005 --> 48:30.973
And I've kept my figure
over the years.

48:30.975 --> 48:34.577
And don't forget,
my sense of adventure.

48:34.579 --> 48:37.647
You just said you wouldn't even
drive a car, Grandma Bibbie.

48:37.649 --> 48:39.248
Well, you've seemed
to have forgotten

48:39.250 --> 48:41.350
that when your great grandfather
and I were married,

48:41.352 --> 48:43.953
we were very much
the outdoorsy type.

48:43.955 --> 48:47.056
As a matter of fact,
your grandfather

48:47.058 --> 48:51.928
was conceived on the banks
of the Colorado River.

48:51.930 --> 48:55.598
It's a terrible shame
about marriages today.

48:55.600 --> 48:59.068
If one marriage doesn't succeed,
they just throw it out

48:59.070 --> 49:01.203
and get another one.

49:01.205 --> 49:05.007
Your great grandfather and I
were married for 60 years.

49:05.009 --> 49:07.510
It was like a...
A dream.

49:08.446 --> 49:11.047
Anyone want more pretzels?

49:11.049 --> 49:12.148
Plenty of...

49:16.287 --> 49:17.586
Priscilla, can I say mine?

49:17.588 --> 49:20.523
-Please.
-My symmetric crossword.

49:22.393 --> 49:24.327
I was always very proud

49:24.329 --> 49:28.698
that I could recite
my favorite poem

49:29.701 --> 49:33.035
by heart since I was 12.

49:34.439 --> 49:36.639
"That is no country for old men.

49:37.709 --> 49:39.241
The young...

49:39.243 --> 49:44.113
in one another's arms,
birds and trees.

49:44.115 --> 49:49.151
The, um, the dying generations
that their song."

49:49.153 --> 49:50.486
Uh...

49:52.190 --> 49:53.556
something...

49:54.559 --> 49:56.726
Something, something mackerel.

49:56.728 --> 49:58.661
Something um...

50:00.098 --> 50:03.366
Something flesh, flower, uh...

50:06.771 --> 50:10.272
"An old man, an aged man is...

50:11.442 --> 50:16.145
but a tattered coat
upon a stick."

50:18.016 --> 50:21.350
"Unless soul clap its hands
and sing.

50:21.352 --> 50:26.522
And louder sing for every tatter
in its mortal dress.

50:26.524 --> 50:30.459
Nor is there singing school
but studying.

50:30.461 --> 50:34.663
Monuments of its own
magnificence and therefore,

50:34.665 --> 50:36.632
I have sailed the seas and come

50:37.602 --> 50:40.770
to the Holy city of Byzantium."

51:53.511 --> 51:54.877

Yes, uh, my book, thank you.

-Hi, Jean.

53:05.917 --> 53:07.516
We're just finishing up.

53:07.518 --> 53:08.951
-Okay.
-Come on in.

53:08.953 --> 53:10.386
Sit down.

[sighs]

53:15.293 --> 53:18.527
"Our days were forever
and a moment.

53:18.529 --> 53:22.198
And they were always and never."

53:24.268 --> 53:25.935
Aw.

53:29.707 --> 53:32.641
Hey, what's wrong, Jean?
Didn't you like the book?

53:34.545 --> 53:35.611
Not really.

53:35.613 --> 53:38.747
I can't imagine anyone
who wouldn't like this book.

53:38.749 --> 53:42.451
It just--
It just didn't ring true.

53:42.453 --> 53:46.488
I mean, we're supposed
to believe it was their fate.

53:46.490 --> 53:48.958
To fall in love in five seconds?

53:49.727 --> 53:51.227
Based on what?

53:51.829 --> 53:52.962
I don't know exactly.

53:52.964 --> 53:56.265
I mean, let's be serious.

53:56.267 --> 53:58.000
The writing is weak.

53:58.002 --> 54:01.270
Okay, okay.
No, no, no, please.

54:01.272 --> 54:02.338
Let me just...

54:02.340 --> 54:03.405
Sure.

54:04.575 --> 54:07.009
Okay then. Um...

54:07.011 --> 54:11.780
"It's as though we too
share one body,

54:11.782 --> 54:14.750
one mind, one spirit."

54:14.752 --> 54:15.985
That is weird.

54:15.987 --> 54:18.587
It-- I mean,
it's borderline creepy.

54:18.589 --> 54:21.557
I'm sorry, but that line
blew me away.

54:21.559 --> 54:24.393
-Me too.
-What is creepy about that?

54:25.763 --> 54:28.264
Two people share one body.

54:28.266 --> 54:29.531
Come on.

54:29.533 --> 54:33.435
That's a-- That's a weird image.

54:33.437 --> 54:35.271
Well, that's not how I read it.

54:35.273 --> 54:36.805
Well then, you read it wrong.

54:41.279 --> 54:42.444
Oh.

54:48.653 --> 54:51.520
A recent graduate.
Avid reader, right?

54:51.522 --> 54:53.989
Although later, I was surprised

54:53.991 --> 54:56.792
at how many classics she missed.

54:56.794 --> 54:59.628
<i> Madam Bovery, Emma,</i>

54:59.630 --> 55:01.797
no Austen at all and--

55:01.799 --> 55:03.932
I just asked
when you got married.

55:05.503 --> 55:06.568
Right.

55:08.639 --> 55:09.705
'91.

55:11.542 --> 55:12.841
Good for you.

55:14.879 --> 55:16.378
You never married at all?

55:19.550 --> 55:21.684
I came close once.

55:21.686 --> 55:24.453
Engaged to a horse trainer
for two years.

55:24.455 --> 55:26.722
You remember how much
I loved horses?

55:26.724 --> 55:28.824
-Right?
-Yes, of course.

55:29.827 --> 55:32.394
More than trainers it turns out.

55:32.863 --> 55:36.865
[laughing]

55:39.704 --> 55:41.637
Yeah, Trudy, um...

55:43.607 --> 55:45.407
ever since we ran
into each other,

55:45.409 --> 55:47.042
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

55:48.346 --> 55:49.778
That's nice.

55:49.780 --> 55:52.715
Um, what I mean to say
is I'm still struggling

55:52.717 --> 55:55.851
with my recollection
of our time together.

55:55.853 --> 55:57.720
Um, and I thought
you might help.

55:57.722 --> 56:01.890
Maybe just walk me through
some of the details

56:01.892 --> 56:04.593
of whatever our relationship was
so that I--

56:04.595 --> 56:05.661
Okay.

56:05.663 --> 56:07.696
I can't do this again.

56:07.698 --> 56:10.699
-No, no, let's just talk--
-Listen, Gordon.

56:10.701 --> 56:13.435
I'm sorry about whatever
is going on with you.

56:13.437 --> 56:15.537
But I'm sure you can understand
how uncomfortable

56:15.539 --> 56:17.373
this must be for me.

56:17.375 --> 56:18.807
-Trudy.
-I'm sure that there are

56:18.809 --> 56:20.976
treatments available.

56:20.978 --> 56:23.846
Therapies maybe.

56:23.848 --> 56:25.981
I wish you the best of luck
with it.

56:26.617 --> 56:28.684
But you-- No.

56:28.686 --> 56:29.918
No.

56:29.920 --> 56:30.886
Wait.

56:31.756 --> 56:34.123
Trudy.
Trudy, wait.

56:34.125 --> 56:35.958
Wait. Wait.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.926
Now, I've been to a doctor.

56:37.928 --> 56:39.661
That sounds like
a positive step.

56:39.663 --> 56:41.663
Yeah, nothing showed up
on the tests.

56:41.665 --> 56:43.932
And he said that there was
nothing wrong with me.

56:43.934 --> 56:46.435
So, the only explanation is...

56:49.106 --> 56:51.840
-Yeah?
-[Gordon] Well, that...

56:51.842 --> 56:54.610
you created this rouse
so that you could get

56:54.612 --> 56:57.179
to know me,
which I find quite flattering.

56:57.181 --> 56:58.981
-But I'm not really in a--
-Wait.

56:58.983 --> 57:00.749
You think I'm stalking you?

57:01.719 --> 57:03.485
When did I call you?

57:03.487 --> 57:05.988
When did I write
or try to contact you

57:05.990 --> 57:07.489
-in any way?
-Yeah, well,

57:07.491 --> 57:09.591
I thought you might be
exceptionally clever

57:09.593 --> 57:12.795
and contrived that chance
meeting in the store.

57:12.797 --> 57:14.747
[laughs]

57:14.748 --> 57:16.698
And you entice me
into pursuing you.

57:22.640 --> 57:23.806
How--

57:23.808 --> 57:26.708
-Get the fuck off of me.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

57:26.710 --> 57:27.743
Hey, hey.

57:27.745 --> 57:29.945
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

57:29.947 --> 57:31.180
Trudy.

57:31.182 --> 57:34.016
I didn't know what I was doing.
I'm sorry.

57:34.018 --> 57:36.518
Are you fucking insane?

57:39.490 --> 57:41.156
I don't know.

58:33.177 --> 58:34.977
[mumbles]

58:35.913 --> 58:37.012
[laughs]

58:55.132 --> 58:56.632
[Gordon] Huh.

58:57.902 --> 58:59.568
Talks too much.

59:01.205 --> 59:02.604
Verbose.

59:03.974 --> 59:05.574
Verbose. Yeah.

59:06.944 --> 59:08.010
Bethany.

59:10.047 --> 59:11.947
Who in the hell is Bethany?

59:13.751 --> 59:15.217
They kill themselves?

59:21.258 --> 59:22.324
Lovers.

59:25.663 --> 59:27.629
Lovers kill themselves.

59:33.170 --> 59:36.171
Hey. Hey, what's up?

59:36.173 --> 59:37.306
Hey.

59:37.308 --> 59:39.908
Uh, I date douche bags.

59:39.910 --> 59:44.079
Um, I sell used clothes
made by Chinese babies.

59:44.081 --> 59:46.815
No, I'm not proud of that,
but thank you for asking.

59:46.817 --> 59:49.051
Um, I'm probably going
to die here

59:49.053 --> 59:50.218
alone in this bedroom.

59:50.220 --> 59:52.654
Do you want to make
a TV show about me?

59:52.656 --> 59:54.990
FML.

59:56.226 --> 59:57.793
Oh, Priscilla.

59:57.795 --> 59:59.127
Jesus, Mom.

59:59.129 --> 01:00:02.631
-What are you doing?
-I wish I knew.

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:05.701
I mean, I got another audition
for that TV show.

01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:07.936
And all they said
was to be myself.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.671
Like, what does that even mean?

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:12.174
Usually, it doesn't involve
practicing.

01:00:12.176 --> 01:00:14.343
Listen, do not forget,

01:00:14.345 --> 01:00:16.912
you have to watch
your grandfather today.

01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:18.914
We're taking Otis
to a birthday party.

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:21.383
That's today? No, I really need
to work on this.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.319
Can't you do it tomorrow?

01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:27.122
You know how birthday parties
work, don't you?

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:29.191
You have them on your birthday.

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:31.059
You couldn't have reminded me?

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:32.227
It's on the calendar.

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:34.997
Exactly one person
looks at that calendar.

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:39.368
You're not going in that,
are you?

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.205
What is wrong
with what I'm wearing?

01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:46.708
Only... everything.
[laughs]

01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:48.410
Come here.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.881
No, no, I cannot wear jeans.
Mm-mm.

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:54.983
Well, you can't wear
what you're wearing.

01:00:55.919 --> 01:00:58.086
It's just... sad.

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:00.656
I'm sad.

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:03.859
Well, you don't have
to make it worse.

01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:06.962
Just put these on.
I'm trying to help you.

01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:15.037
Here, these.

01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:45.133
Huh.

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:52.808
-Okay.
-Like nine million times better.

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:58.714
[all]
¶<i> Happy birthday to you</i> ¶

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:02.984
[applause]

01:02:03.754 --> 01:02:06.488
[indistinct chatter]

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:13.361
Their two-week anniversary,
she said.

01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:14.763
Isn't that precious?

01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:18.400
From that weird boy in my class
to boyfriend.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:20.802
Sorry?

01:02:20.804 --> 01:02:23.071
Otis is weird?
In what way?

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:25.006
He got her attention,
that's what matters, right?

01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:29.244
[Dean] Do you remember, Gordon?

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:32.314
-Huh?
-What it's like to be that age?

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:35.283
[Gordon] Uh, well, of course,
as much as any of us do.

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:39.821
Childhood memory does depend
on interpreting

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:43.191
the association
of individual objects.

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:44.526
Oh, Jesus, Gordon.

01:02:44.528 --> 01:02:47.295
He just means do you remember
what it was like

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:49.231
to feel innocent joy?

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:53.001
Yes, Jean.
I recall joy as a child.

01:02:53.804 --> 01:02:55.237
Even some as an adult.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:58.340
[indistinct chatter]

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:07.382
So, I live with, like, everyone
who's ever been in my family.

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:10.919
Including my grandpa
and my great grandma Bibbie,

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:14.389
who is like the world's
oldest living human.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.191
They're napping right now.

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:19.094
This is...

01:03:19.096 --> 01:03:23.165
a picture of me
when I was a baby.

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:26.067
Lying on a blanket
being very still.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:28.303
According to Bibbie,

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:30.906
this is the greatest thing
I ever did.

01:03:32.376 --> 01:03:33.542
Hey.

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:35.477
What do you know,
maybe I do have

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:37.879
a proudest accomplishment
after all.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:42.918
Here is my parents.
On their wedding day.

01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:46.922
Huh.

01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:49.925
Weird.

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:53.495
[Caterina] <i> Do you want to play</i>
<i> a video game?</i>

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.497
[Otis] Yeah, I guess.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:58.266
Basically, you have to rescue
your family

01:03:58.268 --> 01:03:59.968
and take back the streets.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.903
[siren wailing]

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.439
[man groans]

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:07.275
But you're running over
innocent bystanders

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:08.610
on the sidewalk.

01:04:08.612 --> 01:04:10.979
Oh, that's fine.
Don't worry.

01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:14.115
Just try to kill as many
bad guys as you can for points.

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:15.183
Oh...

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:17.319
okay.

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:24.593
I'm totally his favorite.

01:04:24.595 --> 01:04:26.862
-Right, Grandpa?
-Oh, right.

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:28.563
I take photos too, you know.

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:31.933
-Squirrels mostly.
-[chuckles]

01:04:31.935 --> 01:04:34.536
I know, Grandpa.
I'm actually making a video.

01:04:35.873 --> 01:04:37.606
[laughs]

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:40.942
[phone beeps]

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:44.646
Come here.

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:48.583
Here, wipe your hands.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.986
Thank you.

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:53.154
All right.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.190
Let's play.

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:03.932
Your turn.

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:07.235
You got the color right,
Grandpa.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:09.504
But, see, this is
a four of diamonds.

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:12.440
You have to play a diamond
on a diamond.

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:16.344
And you can only play a five
or a three on a four, see?

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:17.412
Hmm.

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:19.681
We only know a little.

01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:21.683
Huh?

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:26.154
Do what makes you happy.

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:30.525
[laughs]
Okay.

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:44.439
Um...

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:48.677
do you need
to get changed, Grandpa?

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:53.415
Maybe.

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:56.384
Okay.

01:06:04.227 --> 01:06:06.127
[indistinct chatter]

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:09.264
[Dean] What, uh--
What do you do, Gordon?

01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:13.702
Oh, well, I take care of a
family as best I can.

01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:16.137
Though recent events
have led me to consider

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:19.240
that I may have fallen short
in certain areas.

01:06:21.244 --> 01:06:22.577
Hell, who hasn't?

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:25.413
But you live with all that.

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:28.116
Right?
The creeping disappointment.

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:33.088
You think a kid will fix it.
But it's more of just the same.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.290
Well, we're certainly
not disappointed

01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:37.292
-in our children.
-[Gordon] No, absolutely not.

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:40.195
I hope that Priscilla
would take her education

01:06:40.197 --> 01:06:42.630
more seriously,
get into a proper college.

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:45.066
Well, maybe you didn't
give her the confidence.

01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:47.168
I mean, who can compete
with you?

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:49.070
Spouting facts all day long.

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:52.407
I mean, I'm not saying
that she hasn't always

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:54.142
been a challenge.

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:56.111
-Right from birth.
-[Gordon] Yeah, I wonder

01:06:56.113 --> 01:06:58.646
where she got that
preternatural dissatisfaction?

01:06:58.648 --> 01:07:01.149
Guys.
It's a party for the kids.

01:07:01.151 --> 01:07:02.517
-Let's try--
-[Linda] What, Dean,

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:05.186
is their honesty
making you uncomfortable?

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:09.391
Are you worried we'll have
to talk about you and Roger

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:11.760
and your late-night
training sessions?

01:07:11.762 --> 01:07:14.496
I'm not having
this conversation now.

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:17.198
-You're drunk.
-Of course I'm drunk.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.134
What reasonable person
wouldn't be?

01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:21.669
Mom, can I open my presents yet?

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:22.771
Sure.

01:07:22.773 --> 01:07:25.106
Here, Dad, hold this, please.

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:28.176
[indistinct chatter]

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.479
[phone vibrating]

01:07:36.787 --> 01:07:38.586
[chuckles]
It's...

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:42.090
That's an old friend
from college.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:01.276
[Priscilla] There we go.

01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:31.706
[water running]

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:43.218
Now you have to move
this foot, Grandpa.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.822
-No, no, no. No, this foot.
-It's okay, I'll do it.

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:49.491
If you'll only
just lift up your--

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:50.692
[Theodore] Priscilla!

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.393
I can do it.

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:57.599
Thank you, dear.
Thank you.

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:07.408
[crying]

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:10.645
-[Otis] I wrapped it myself.
-Oh.

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:16.917
I made it special.
Here are the clues.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.386
So, you see, you go over here
and you see

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:22.189
three down says "bad jellybean"
and then you look at the puzzle

01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:23.691
to see how many letters it is.

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:26.194
"Talks a lot girl."
That's Bethany.

01:09:26.196 --> 01:09:28.863
Right. So you go over here
and then you look at the puzzle

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:30.532
and then you compare
the letters.

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:32.667
And then you can just
write down.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.770
That ones from me.

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:45.279
Yes!

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:52.319
[sighs]

01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:08.469
[Theodore] Lie down.
Get in your bed.

01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:17.345
Optometry.

01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:19.447
Copeland.

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:20.682
New York.

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:26.454
Good boy.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:28.890
See you later.

01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:01.723
Well, Linda certainly seems
to have an immodest approach

01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:03.524
to her family matters.

01:11:03.526 --> 01:11:05.893
[scoffs] Well, I actually find
it refreshing to hear someone

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:08.263
speak openly
about their marriage problems.

01:11:08.265 --> 01:11:11.666
That was someone that
I apparently dated in college.

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:13.401
-I had no--
-I don't care, Gordon.

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:15.036
No, it doesn't seem
you do of late.

01:11:15.038 --> 01:11:17.772
Well, at least you noticed.

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:21.909
I suppose I should be grateful

01:11:21.911 --> 01:11:24.512
that you're even remotely aware
of anything

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:27.749
-that's going on with me at all.
-No, I am-- I am plenty aware

01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:29.884
of-- Hey, Otie.

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:34.455
How did your special crossword
go with Caterina?

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:38.393
Not that great.
Actually, she broke up with me.

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:40.361
-What?
-What?

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:42.830
Another boy gave her
a better present.

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:45.500
She said that he was going
to be her boyfriend, so...

01:11:45.502 --> 01:11:51.472
Oh, Otie, she will learn
that life is not about things.

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:54.375
You're a wonderful boy.

01:11:54.377 --> 01:11:55.977
Yeah, your mother's right.

01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:58.846
You know, you may feel
terrible right now.

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:00.915
-But it's--
-It doesn't feel terrible.

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:03.084
Caterina and I were lovers
for two weeks

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:04.552
and it was amazing.

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:06.454
Don't worry, Mom.

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:08.056
I promise I'm not going
to kill myself.

01:12:09.359 --> 01:12:10.692
[car door opens]

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:14.629
[car door closes]

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:32.847
[sniffs]

01:12:41.558 --> 01:12:42.790
[knocks on door]

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:43.858
Grandpa?

01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:46.627
Grandpa?

01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:48.663
Everything okay in there?

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:52.467
Shit.

01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:53.901
Grandpa?

01:12:56.106 --> 01:12:57.472
Grandpa!

01:12:57.474 --> 01:12:58.840
Where are you?

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:01.976
Grandpa?

01:13:03.012 --> 01:13:04.078
Oh.

01:13:08.418 --> 01:13:10.084
So you escaped, huh?

01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:15.990
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

01:13:34.511 --> 01:13:35.576
Grandpa?

01:13:43.987 --> 01:13:45.953
Fuck.
Grandpa!

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:50.658
[cries]
Grandpa.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:51.859
Hey, look at this.

01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:54.495
A little porch time.

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:59.867
Otie, go around the back way
and go to your room.

01:13:59.869 --> 01:14:01.969
-Why, what is it--
-Just-- Otie, go around.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.641
You guys fucked up.

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.042
All right, Priscilla.

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:10.678
Calm down.
Tell us what happened.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.013
No.

01:14:12.015 --> 01:14:14.982
You guys fucked up.

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:19.654
Grandpa needed a nursing home
or something.

01:14:19.656 --> 01:14:22.690
What made you think
you could manage this?

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:24.826
What made you think
I could manage this?

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:28.763
He asked me for five minutes
in the bathroom.

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:31.165
And he died.

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:33.968
When you can't leave someone
alone for five minutes,

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.137
you clearly can't take care
of them yourself.

01:14:37.173 --> 01:14:40.107
You guys fucked this shit
all up.

01:14:41.511 --> 01:14:43.744
You should have known.

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:51.185
Now, one of you go call someone
to come and get him, please.

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:57.525
Dad?

01:14:58.695 --> 01:14:59.760
Um...

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:02.630
you have to tell Grandma Bibbie.

01:15:05.969 --> 01:15:07.034
Yeah.

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:15.009
[Vivian] Ten minutes late
to dinner.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:16.511
Where have you all been?

01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:19.180
[Gordon] It's Dad, Grandma,
it's Dad.

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:21.649
What's the matter,
did he fall down again?

01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:23.684
No, no, no, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:25.853
What I'm trying to say is...

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:28.623
he's gone.

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:30.791
He passed.

01:15:32.295 --> 01:15:33.728
He passed.

01:15:41.104 --> 01:15:42.169
I see.

01:16:23.046 --> 01:16:24.779
My father was an artist.

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:28.015
He made his living
as an optometrist.

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:29.083
But...

01:16:30.286 --> 01:16:33.588
his humor and his soul
belonged to art.

01:16:34.724 --> 01:16:36.591
He was my inspiration.

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:42.263
I remember as a small boy,
he helped me carve wood blocks

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:43.831
to make prints.

01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:47.034
It was as a child

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:50.037
that his love of art
took root in me.

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:53.708
Somewhere along the line,
that was put aside

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.142
for practical matters.

01:16:55.144 --> 01:17:01.082
He was a beloved husband,
son, grandfather, and...

01:17:02.085 --> 01:17:03.751
father to me.

01:17:08.024 --> 01:17:09.223
Anecdotes...

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:18.866
Well, I was recently implicated
in an occurrence

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:23.671
in which I became uncertain
of my cerebral facilities

01:17:23.673 --> 01:17:27.108
of which I had previously
been very certain.

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:31.312
Frankly, I thought
I'd lost my mind.

01:17:33.116 --> 01:17:35.149
Maybe I did, I don't know.

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:41.255
Maybe it wasn't the disaster
I initially believed it to be.

01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:42.890
Maybe it was a blessing.

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:45.426
I think we should all lose
our minds

01:17:45.428 --> 01:17:47.328
and find new ones now and again.

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:53.367
I'm not one for God especially,
I'm sorry to say that

01:17:53.369 --> 01:17:55.202
in a church, but...

01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:03.044
I think hopefully,
my father is with my mother.

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:06.781
Laura.

01:18:09.285 --> 01:18:11.185
And that his mind rests.

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:28.402
Hey.

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.774
Yeah, oh.

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:36.711
[Taylor] Hi, P.

01:18:36.713 --> 01:18:38.312
Hi, Mrs. C.

01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:40.314
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:42.283
Priscilla and I
are best friends.

01:18:42.285 --> 01:18:44.151
Like, we're practically sisters.

01:18:44.153 --> 01:18:46.020
She just lost her grandpa.

01:18:46.022 --> 01:18:49.090
Anyway, I just wanted to stop by
and pay my respects.

01:18:49.092 --> 01:18:50.324
Hugs and kisses.

01:18:54.097 --> 01:18:58.299
Oh, this is not happening.

01:18:58.301 --> 01:19:00.801
I can't believe Taylor
got the show.

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:02.536
Taylor!

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:04.270
-I'm sorry, Priscilla.
-I don't get it.

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:06.373
I-- First, Kyle, and now this?

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:10.311
I failed.

01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:16.383
And I feel like
I'm doing life completely wrong.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:18.786
Do you ever feel that way?

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:21.922
Yes.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:23.924
I'm almost 20 years old

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:25.993
and I have nothing to show
for myself.

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:28.395
I have good hair.

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:31.198
I could be, like, a hair model.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.199
Priscilla...

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.771
there's more to you than hair.

01:19:36.773 --> 01:19:37.838
Like what?

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.141
Do you think
I'm good at anything?

01:19:42.545 --> 01:19:44.211
-Mom!
-Well, no, honey,

01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:46.814
I'm sure you are.
Everyone is good at something.

01:19:46.816 --> 01:19:48.983
Oh, great, but, like,
you have no idea.

01:19:48.985 --> 01:19:51.218
Well, I thought you said
you were interested in fashion.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.821
Well, I was. I am.

01:19:53.823 --> 01:19:57.558
But, I mean,
you can't just decide

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.094
-to be Rachel Zoe.
-Mm-hmm, that's right.

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:01.962
You actually have to work
for things.

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:04.298
Mom, you don't understand.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:08.469
I was so sure
that this was my destiny.

01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:11.372
Life is what you make it.

01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:18.412
Make your own fucking reality.

01:20:36.866 --> 01:20:39.834
So, I finally took a bunch
of her things

01:20:39.836 --> 01:20:41.268
to sell at the flea market.

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:46.173
I wound up buying
a bunch of stuff

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:47.908
that reminded me of her.

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:51.512
So, I guess I'm not ready
to move on yet.

01:20:52.582 --> 01:20:54.081
[social worker] Claire?

01:20:55.585 --> 01:20:57.151
Do you want to share?

01:20:57.153 --> 01:20:59.920
No, I don't feel safe sharing.

01:20:59.922 --> 01:21:01.889
Why is that, hon?

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.427
Because someone here is a liar.

01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:17.204
I went to Jean's house to return
that book that she left.

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:20.441
And the man that answered
the door

01:21:20.443 --> 01:21:22.276
introduced himself
as her husband.

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:26.180
He looked pretty alive to me.

01:21:30.953 --> 01:21:33.520
I'm a cheater, not a liar.

01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:37.024
I fell in love with another man.

01:21:37.927 --> 01:21:39.627
And he hung himself.

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:41.428
So...

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:45.165
can you direct me to the
correct support group for that?

01:21:45.167 --> 01:21:48.569
No? Well, I didn't think so.

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:53.440
Yeah, I changed some facts
but my pain is as real

01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:55.075
as anyone's here.

01:21:55.678 --> 01:21:58.212
That sounds horrible.

01:21:58.214 --> 01:22:01.115
But you should have told us
the truth.

01:22:01.117 --> 01:22:02.717
Really?

01:22:02.718 --> 01:22:04.318
I mean, does anyone actually
want the truth?

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:09.356
Because the truth is full
of aging and disease

01:22:09.358 --> 01:22:10.991
and death and heartbreak.

01:22:10.993 --> 01:22:13.294
So, is it any wonder
I wanted to run from it?

01:22:14.664 --> 01:22:16.530
I just tried to do it
with someone

01:22:16.532 --> 01:22:18.999
who wanted to escape
more than I did.

01:22:19.001 --> 01:22:21.235
[social worker]
The truth doesn't care

01:22:21.237 --> 01:22:23.003
whether we want it or not.

01:22:24.006 --> 01:22:25.406
It just is.

01:22:28.177 --> 01:22:30.544
I'm sorry
I wasn't entirely honest.

01:22:31.547 --> 01:22:33.981
But I won't apologize
about James.

01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:37.351
I regret hurting anyone,
but it was the most honest thing

01:22:37.353 --> 01:22:38.485
I'd done in years.

01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:44.558
There was no inciting incident
as they say.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.328
Would have been
a deadly dull book

01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:49.129
the story of what happened
to my marriage.

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:53.033
But in some...

01:22:53.035 --> 01:22:58.105
fuzzy area,
I forgot why I mattered.

01:22:58.975 --> 01:23:01.275
I felt irrelevant.

01:23:02.445 --> 01:23:04.144
Not worth the effort
of tossing out.

01:23:04.146 --> 01:23:06.313
Not worth saving,
just something that...

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:09.016
gets shelved and gathers dust.

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:16.090
Make your own fucking reality.

01:23:26.736 --> 01:23:29.770
[Jean] <i> Maybe we're not</i>
<i> the most reliable narrators</i>

01:23:29.772 --> 01:23:31.505

And there is a Catskill eagle

that can alike dive down
into the blackest gorges

01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:05.699
and soar out of them again

01:25:05.701 --> 01:25:09.103
and become invisible
in the sunny spaces."
