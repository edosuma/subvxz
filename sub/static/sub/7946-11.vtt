Please, please,

07:46.731 --> 07:48.250
please, please,

07:45.209 --> 07:48.250
please?

07:48.292 --> 07:49.314
Hey, I caught her.

07:49.315 --> 07:50.334
Finders keepers.

07:50.375 --> 07:51.397
Guys, she's not

07:51.398 --> 07:52.417
a penny

07:50.375 --> 07:52.417
on the sidewalk.

07:52.459 --> 07:54.167
Yeah!

07:54.209 --> 07:56.334
Wait, what's a penny?

07:56.375 --> 07:57.751
Don't ask us.

07:57.752 --> 07:59.125
We round to

07:56.375 --> 07:59.125
the nearest thousand.

08:01.209 --> 08:02.292
Okay, we should

08:02.293 --> 08:03.375
let you get some rest.

08:03.417 --> 08:04.778
- I'll show you
- to the stateroom.

08:05.417 --> 08:06.334
(GASPS)

08:06.375 --> 08:07.792
Whoops!

08:07.834 --> 08:09.476
- It's like I don't know
- how to work my legs.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.751
JESSIE: Ah...

08:10.792 --> 08:12.310
- Been there. - After my first
- Spin class,

08:12.334 --> 08:13.626
- I couldn't walk
- for a week.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.667
Guys, I figured it out!

08:18.709 --> 08:20.459
Swims in the ocean,

08:20.500 --> 08:21.730
wears a shell bra

08:21.731 --> 08:22.959
and seaweed,

08:23.000 --> 08:24.105
doesn't know how

08:24.106 --> 08:25.209
to work her legs...

08:25.250 --> 08:27.042
- Don't you see
- what Delphina is?

08:27.083 --> 08:28.209
A clumsy

08:28.210 --> 08:29.334
shell collector with

08:27.083 --> 08:29.334
no fashion sense?

08:30.667 --> 08:34.208
No! She's a mermaid!

08:34.250 --> 08:35.480
I'm pretty sure

08:35.481 --> 08:36.708
we can still get

08:34.250 --> 08:36.708
married in California.

08:41.375 --> 08:42.375
Okay, Delphina

08:42.376 --> 08:43.376
is lying down.

08:43.417 --> 08:44.730
I hope you tucked

08:44.731 --> 08:46.042
her in with a wet towel.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.375
We gotta keep her moist!

08:47.417 --> 08:49.375
Why? She's not a meatloaf.

08:50.459 --> 08:51.647
I know.

08:51.648 --> 08:52.834
She's a mermaid!

08:52.876 --> 08:53.960
I told you we'd

08:53.961 --> 08:55.042
find one out here!

08:55.083 --> 08:56.209
Zuri, Delphina

08:56.210 --> 08:57.334
is not a mermaid.

08:57.375 --> 08:59.042
- And please
- don't tell her she is.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.685
- The poor kid's already
- confused enough.

09:00.709 --> 09:01.814
I know a mermaid

09:01.815 --> 09:02.918
when I see one!

09:02.959 --> 09:05.042
Okay, Ravi, back me up.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.772
Actually, more than 95%

09:06.773 --> 09:08.459
of the ocean is unexplored.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.375
- New species are
- discovered every day.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.896
So a mermaid is not

09:11.897 --> 09:13.375
altogether implausible.

09:13.417 --> 09:14.876
See? Smarty McScience

09:14.877 --> 09:16.334
over here agrees with me!

09:18.083 --> 09:19.355
I have so many

09:19.356 --> 09:20.626
questions for Delphina.

09:20.667 --> 09:21.876
- I'm gonna go
- get my list!

09:23.459 --> 09:24.584
Thanks. You're about

09:24.585 --> 09:25.709
as supportive as a tube top.

09:27.918 --> 09:28.980
Speaking of bad

09:28.981 --> 09:30.042
fashion choices,

09:30.083 --> 09:31.792
- Delphina really
- needs a makeover.

09:31.834 --> 09:32.939
And since she obviously

09:32.940 --> 09:34.042
can't remember

09:31.834 --> 09:34.042
what her style was,

09:34.083 --> 09:35.230
she'll be like my own

09:35.231 --> 09:36.375
personal mannequin!

09:36.417 --> 09:37.439
With flesh,

09:37.440 --> 09:38.459
blood, and feelings.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.500
Yeah, yeah.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.563
Stop treating her

09:42.564 --> 09:44.042
like an object.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.417
She belongs to me!

09:47.626 --> 09:49.043
I'm gonna take care

09:49.044 --> 09:50.459
of her for

09:47.626 --> 09:50.459
the rest of her life.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.042
However long fish live.

09:53.083 --> 09:54.709
Ah, Luke, always

09:54.710 --> 09:56.334
willing to help others.

09:56.375 --> 09:57.397
And yet when

09:57.398 --> 09:58.417
I was a buck short

09:56.375 --> 09:58.417
at the deli,

09:58.459 --> 09:59.560
- he pretended
- not to know me.

09:59.584 --> 10:01.334
- What?
- I don't remember that.

10:01.375 --> 10:02.688
I do. When I insisted

10:02.689 --> 10:04.000
you give me the money,

10:04.042 --> 10:05.042
you screamed,

10:05.043 --> 10:06.043
"Stranger danger!"

10:06.083 --> 10:07.143
- And the man behind
- the counter

10:07.167 --> 10:08.709
- Beat me unconscious
- with a brisket!

10:11.083 --> 10:12.542
Oh, yeah!

10:12.543 --> 10:14.000
(LAUGHING)

10:17.626 --> 10:19.000
Hey, don't worry,

10:19.042 --> 10:20.810
- we're gonna get - you back home
- As soon as we can.

10:20.834 --> 10:22.126
So, any chance you

10:22.127 --> 10:23.417
remember where that is?

10:23.459 --> 10:24.751
(SIGHS)

10:24.752 --> 10:26.042
Sorry, no.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.042
- But I think my memory
- could come back,

10:28.083 --> 10:29.083
With a little

10:29.084 --> 10:30.084
peace and quiet.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.667
ZURI: Delphina!

10:32.709 --> 10:35.500
(BOTH CLAMORING)

10:35.542 --> 10:36.542
Ow! You rolled over

10:36.543 --> 10:37.543
my foot!

10:39.709 --> 10:40.772
Peace and quiet

10:40.773 --> 10:41.834
is not our thing.

10:43.459 --> 10:44.730
Do you sleep in a giant,

10:44.731 --> 10:46.000
pearl-encrusted seashell?

10:46.042 --> 10:48.042
- How do you keep the sheets
- from getting wet?

10:48.083 --> 10:49.313
Also, do trampolines

10:49.314 --> 10:50.542
work under water?

10:51.876 --> 10:53.626
Who cares?

10:53.667 --> 10:55.518
- Delphina, I want you - to try on some
- Of my new designs.

10:55.542 --> 10:57.083
Okay!

10:57.125 --> 10:59.480
Speaking of clothes,

10:59.481 --> 11:01.834
I have this hazy memory

10:57.125 --> 11:01.834
of wearing tails.

11:01.876 --> 11:03.042
Is that a thing?

11:03.083 --> 11:04.855
Sure, if you're a groom,

11:04.856 --> 11:06.626
or a magician over 60.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.918
Come on!

11:07.959 --> 11:10.042
(CHUCKLES)

11:10.083 --> 11:11.355
(SOFTLY) See?

11:11.356 --> 11:12.626
She remembers

11:10.083 --> 11:12.626
having a tail!

11:12.667 --> 11:14.042
She's a mermaid!

11:14.083 --> 11:15.935
- So what? I had an uncle
- who really did have a tail.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.000
Didn't make him a horse.

11:19.542 --> 11:21.293
Ladies, I give you

11:21.294 --> 11:23.042
the new and

11:19.542 --> 11:23.042
improved Delphina.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.542
Outfit by Emma Ross.

11:25.792 --> 11:27.042
Wow, you look great!

11:27.083 --> 11:29.500
Like a whole new person.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.709
Thanks!

11:31.751 --> 11:33.917
Wait a minute,

11:33.918 --> 11:36.083
I just had this

11:31.751 --> 11:36.083
random memory.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.396
I'm seeing a man

11:38.397 --> 11:40.667
with a big white beard...

11:40.709 --> 11:42.459
carrying a giant fork?

11:42.500 --> 11:43.584
(SQUEALS)

11:43.626 --> 11:44.709
That's your dad!

11:44.710 --> 11:45.792
His name is Poseid...

11:45.834 --> 11:47.418
Done with

11:47.419 --> 11:49.000
that subject!

11:49.042 --> 11:50.521
Zuri, why don't we leave

11:50.522 --> 11:52.000
these two to try on

11:49.042 --> 11:52.000
more outfits, okay?

11:53.667 --> 11:55.083
Hey.

11:55.125 --> 11:57.143
- That "white beard, fork"
- stuff doesn't prove anything.

11:57.167 --> 11:59.042
- Mer-haters
- gonna mer-hate.

12:04.042 --> 12:06.271
Hello, I am Bertravi,

Ravi, we're on vacation!

Why are you

12:45.356 --> 12:46.626
still reading?

12:46.667 --> 12:48.355
Zuri asked me to

12:48.356 --> 12:50.042
help her prove that Delphina

12:46.667 --> 12:50.042
is really a mermaid.

12:50.083 --> 12:52.063
And if I can, I could become

12:52.064 --> 12:54.042
the youngest person ever

12:50.083 --> 12:54.042
to receive a Nobel Prize!

12:59.792 --> 13:01.418
Just hold Delphina

13:01.419 --> 13:03.042
down while I dump a bucket

12:59.792 --> 13:03.042
of water on her legs!

13:03.083 --> 13:04.083
Bada-bing, bada-boom,

13:04.084 --> 13:05.084
girl grows a tail,

13:05.125 --> 13:06.542
and I've proved

13:06.543 --> 13:07.959
she's a mermaid.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.293
There will be

13:09.294 --> 13:10.584
no bada-binging

13:08.000 --> 13:10.584
or bada-booming.

13:10.626 --> 13:12.000
- You need to
- bada-butt-out.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.667
I have got it!

13:14.709 --> 13:15.876
If I simply test

13:15.877 --> 13:17.042
Delphina's DNA,

13:17.083 --> 13:18.563
I will be able to determine

13:18.564 --> 13:20.042
whether or not

13:17.083 --> 13:20.042
she is part fish.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.083
Brilliant! Then science

13:22.084 --> 13:24.083
will prove what

13:20.083 --> 13:24.083
we've known all along...

13:24.125 --> 13:26.626
That I'm always right.

13:26.667 --> 13:27.814
If DNA testing

13:27.815 --> 13:28.959
is what it takes

13:26.667 --> 13:28.959
to show you guys

13:29.000 --> 13:30.022
she's not a mermaid,

13:30.023 --> 13:31.042
then fine.

13:31.083 --> 13:32.768
- But wouldn't you need
- lab equipment for that?

13:32.792 --> 13:34.772
Yeah, and what kind

13:34.773 --> 13:36.751
of lame-o brings

13:32.792 --> 13:36.751
a microscope on vacation?

13:36.792 --> 13:41.042
Ravi "Lame-o" Ross.

13:41.083 --> 13:42.501
Now all I need

13:42.502 --> 13:43.918
from Delphina

13:41.083 --> 13:43.918
is a skin sample,

13:43.959 --> 13:45.001
or better yet,

13:45.002 --> 13:46.042
a swab of her saliva.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.751
I'm on it!

13:47.792 --> 13:49.125
Nice try.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.247
- Only thing you're going
- to swab is the poop deck.

13:57.209 --> 13:58.709
Delphina!

13:58.751 --> 13:59.814
This is going

13:59.815 --> 14:00.876
to sound odd,

14:00.918 --> 14:02.584
but could I trouble you for

14:02.585 --> 14:04.250
a flake of your dead skin?

14:04.292 --> 14:05.668
Delphina, would you

14:05.669 --> 14:07.042
like some water?

14:04.292 --> 14:07.042
Okay.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.522
I better warn you

14:08.523 --> 14:09.959
in advance,

14:07.083 --> 14:09.959
I'm a little clumsy.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.042
No!

14:11.083 --> 14:12.334
(CHUCKLES)

14:13.083 --> 14:14.751
Mmm.

14:14.792 --> 14:15.897
Sorry, Delphina,

14:15.898 --> 14:17.000
I'm just

14:14.792 --> 14:17.000
really thirsty.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.542
Delphina, I can't wait

14:21.543 --> 14:23.000
to take you

14:20.083 --> 14:23.000
on a shopping spree.

14:23.042 --> 14:24.084
I know every

14:24.085 --> 14:25.125
designer shoe store

14:23.042 --> 14:25.125
on the Upper West Side.

14:25.167 --> 14:27.000
- She doesn't need shoes,
- because she's a...

14:27.042 --> 14:28.959
- Uh, more of - a flip-flop
- Kind of girl.

14:30.918 --> 14:33.042
Uh, excuse me everyone!

14:33.083 --> 14:35.083
I wrote a little poem.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.604
Oh, Luke, not another

14:36.605 --> 14:38.083
love poem about me.

14:38.125 --> 14:41.209
"Oh, Delphina, my Delphina."

14:41.250 --> 14:42.459
Okay, now I'm

14:42.460 --> 14:43.667
irritated and hurt.

14:45.459 --> 14:46.771
"Your skin is

14:46.772 --> 14:48.083
as white as hand soap.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.459
"Your hair is blonde

14:49.460 --> 14:50.792
like a loofah.

14:50.834 --> 14:52.105
"Your hands are soft

14:52.106 --> 14:53.375
like a washcloth.

14:53.417 --> 14:55.293
"I love you,

14:55.294 --> 14:57.167
and this poem

14:53.417 --> 14:57.167
is proof-uh."

14:59.125 --> 15:00.418
Let me guess,

15:00.419 --> 15:01.709
you wrote that

14:59.125 --> 15:01.709
in the bathroom?

15:03.083 --> 15:04.709
How did you know?

15:05.751 --> 15:07.834
What a moving poem.

15:09.334 --> 15:11.042
- Here is a napkin
- for your tears.

15:11.083 --> 15:13.042
But I'm not crying.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.444
- Then blow your nose. - I will take it
- When you are done.

15:16.459 --> 15:17.751
What Delphina needs

15:17.752 --> 15:19.042
is a nice glass of water.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.083
No!

15:21.292 --> 15:22.730
Water is bad

15:22.731 --> 15:24.167
for amnesia.

15:24.209 --> 15:25.501
I read it

15:25.502 --> 15:26.792
on the Internet.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.459
Oh no, Delphina,

15:28.460 --> 15:30.083
you have something

15:26.834 --> 15:30.083
on your cheek.

15:30.125 --> 15:31.272
No, the inside

15:31.273 --> 15:32.417
of your cheek.

15:32.459 --> 15:34.168
Just for fun,

15:34.169 --> 15:35.876
retrieve it with this.

15:35.918 --> 15:36.918
Just... Just...

15:39.042 --> 15:40.751
Hey, whoa, whoa!

15:40.792 --> 15:42.001
If anyone is gonna pick

15:42.002 --> 15:43.209
food out of her mouth,

15:40.792 --> 15:43.209
it's gonna be me.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.313
Okay, I am gravely

15:45.314 --> 15:47.375
concerned about

15:43.250 --> 15:47.375
your idea of romance.

15:47.417 --> 15:48.605
Can everyone just

15:48.606 --> 15:49.792
leave my mannequin...

15:49.834 --> 15:50.834
I mean, my friend,

15:50.835 --> 15:51.835
alone?

15:51.876 --> 15:52.876
I will. Right after

15:52.877 --> 15:53.877
a quick swab!

15:53.918 --> 15:54.959
- Wait...
- No, Ravi!

15:55.000 --> 15:56.751
Ravi!

15:59.250 --> 16:00.375
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

16:00.417 --> 16:02.000
I know you don't remember,

16:02.042 --> 16:03.876
- but that's how
- people say "goodbye."

16:10.000 --> 16:11.292
(MRS. KIPLING SNARLING)

16:13.000 --> 16:14.834
Mrs. Kipling!

16:14.876 --> 16:17.375
You did all this for me?

16:18.834 --> 16:20.000
(MUSIC PLAYING)

16:23.500 --> 16:26.125
Oh, my Godzilla!

16:28.083 --> 16:31.000
Okay, this can never happen.

16:31.042 --> 16:32.189
I'm very flattered,

16:32.190 --> 16:33.334
but Ravi is a friend,

16:33.375 --> 16:34.855
and you are a lizard,

16:34.856 --> 16:36.334
and this is freaky.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.876
Uh-oh.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.480
Apparently,

16:43.481 --> 16:45.042
you will not be ignored.

16:45.083 --> 16:46.500
(WHIMPERING)

16:50.083 --> 16:51.417
Guys, we're changing course.

16:51.459 --> 16:53.101
- I told the captain
- to stop at the nearest port

16:53.125 --> 16:54.876
- And help Delphina
- find her family.

16:54.918 --> 16:56.876
- If you want to find
- Delphina's family,

16:56.918 --> 16:58.834
- You're gonna
- need scuba gear.

16:59.209 --> 17:01.125
Zuri, I already told you,

17:01.167 --> 17:02.605
Delphina is just

17:02.606 --> 17:04.041
a very nice,

17:01.167 --> 17:04.041
very confused...

17:04.083 --> 17:05.166
Mermaid!

17:05.209 --> 17:06.355
She is a mermaid!

17:06.356 --> 17:07.500
I have proof!

17:07.541 --> 17:09.041
I knew it!

17:09.083 --> 17:10.166
- What?
- Let me see that.

17:10.209 --> 17:11.584
According to my analysis

17:11.585 --> 17:12.959
of Delphina's DNA,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.041
she is part fish!

17:14.083 --> 17:15.105
I am going to win

17:15.106 --> 17:16.125
the Nobel Prize!

17:16.166 --> 17:18.083
- I hate to say
- I told you so...

17:18.125 --> 17:19.584
Oh, who am I kidding?

17:19.585 --> 17:21.041
I love it!

17:21.083 --> 17:22.230
I can't wait

17:22.231 --> 17:23.375
for our first kiss.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.146
Imagine how long

17:25.147 --> 17:26.876
she can hold her breath!

17:26.917 --> 17:27.959
She's gonna

17:27.960 --> 17:29.000
have to if she's

17:26.917 --> 17:29.000
anywhere near you.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.647
You smell like

17:31.648 --> 17:33.042
low-tide burped.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.792
This DNA evidence

17:35.793 --> 17:38.500
is incontrovertible proof that

17:33.083 --> 17:38.500
Delphina is really a mermaid!

17:38.542 --> 17:40.042
- JESSIE:
- You know what? Fine.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.042
- Then maybe you should
- put your clipboard away

17:41.083 --> 17:42.959
- And get your safety
- binder back out.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.292
I do not follow.

17:44.334 --> 17:46.134
- Well, you better hope
- she's not a mermaid,

17:46.167 --> 17:47.314
Because they're famous

17:47.315 --> 17:48.459
for singing

17:46.167 --> 17:48.459
their siren songs

17:48.500 --> 17:49.751
and causing boats

17:49.752 --> 17:51.000
to crash into rocks!

17:51.042 --> 17:52.813
Oh, no! Delphina

17:52.814 --> 17:54.584
is going to kill us all!

17:54.626 --> 17:55.959
Safety drill!

17:56.000 --> 17:57.459
I'm a mermaid?

17:57.500 --> 17:58.751
And I'm going

17:58.752 --> 18:00.000
to sink this ship?

18:00.042 --> 18:01.126
To the lifeboats!

18:01.127 --> 18:02.209
Women and children first!

18:02.250 --> 18:03.292
That's all of us.

18:03.334 --> 18:04.334
(SCREAMING)

18:08.083 --> 18:09.626
Boy down!

18:09.667 --> 18:11.647
First aid procedures

18:11.648 --> 18:13.626
are on page 296

18:09.667 --> 18:13.626
of my safety binder.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.918
Just get some ice.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.522
If I'm a mermaid,

18:22.523 --> 18:24.042
then you're all doomed!

18:24.083 --> 18:25.584
- And you've been
- so nice to me!

18:25.626 --> 18:26.959
(CHUCKLES)

18:27.000 --> 18:28.584
- Some of you
- a little too nice.

18:30.083 --> 18:31.918
Way to smother her, Zuri.

18:33.167 --> 18:34.605
The point is,

18:34.606 --> 18:36.042
I don't want to

18:33.167 --> 18:36.042
hurt you guys.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.123
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Wait!

18:38.500 --> 18:40.542
No, don't go!

18:40.584 --> 18:42.000
Goodbye, Zuri.

18:47.083 --> 18:48.772
No, no, no!

18:48.773 --> 18:50.459
Delphina, get down!

18:47.083 --> 18:50.459
You're going to get hurt!

18:50.500 --> 18:52.376
I won't get hurt.

18:52.377 --> 18:54.250
I'm a mermaid!

18:54.292 --> 18:56.000
- Wait, don't...
- (WATER SPLASHING)

18:58.083 --> 18:59.855
DELPHINA: (SCREAMING)

18:59.856 --> 19:01.626
You know what?

18:58.083 --> 19:01.626
Not a mermaid!

19:01.667 --> 19:03.042
- That's what
- I've been saying!

19:03.751 --> 19:04.959
Here! Go!

19:09.083 --> 19:10.209
(PANTING)

19:10.250 --> 19:12.417
I think I lost her.

19:12.459 --> 19:14.730
Wow, I've had some

19:14.731 --> 19:17.000
dates dig their claws in,

19:12.459 --> 19:17.000
but this is ridiculous.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.417
(GASPS)

19:19.459 --> 19:21.292
Nice lizard...

19:21.334 --> 19:22.667
I know I'm a beefcake,

19:22.668 --> 19:24.000
but please don't eat me.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.167
Ravi said in

19:28.168 --> 19:29.250
case of an emergency,

19:29.292 --> 19:31.146
to hit the "Mrs. Kipling" icon

19:31.147 --> 19:33.000
on his tablet

19:29.292 --> 19:33.000
and place on the floor.

19:33.751 --> 19:35.000
(TABLET BEEPING)

19:38.083 --> 19:39.250
Hello, Mrs. Kipling.

19:39.292 --> 19:41.042
- I figured you might
- miss me,

19:41.083 --> 19:42.230
So I created this hologram

19:42.231 --> 19:43.375
to keep you company.

19:45.125 --> 19:46.772
Whenever you feel lonely,

19:46.773 --> 19:48.417
you can tap the screen

19:45.125 --> 19:48.417
and I will appear.

19:48.459 --> 19:50.417
I will now regale you

19:50.418 --> 19:52.375
with the tales of

19:48.459 --> 19:52.375
my epic chess battles.

19:52.417 --> 19:53.417
I was down to two

19:53.418 --> 19:54.418
pawns and a rook...

19:54.459 --> 19:55.751
(GROWLS)

19:55.752 --> 19:57.042
So I looked at my opponent

19:54.459 --> 19:57.042
dead in the eyes...

19:57.083 --> 19:59.042
It worked!

19:59.083 --> 20:01.000
- I guess there is
- an app for everything.

20:04.083 --> 20:05.209
As soon as I hit

20:05.210 --> 20:06.334
that freezing cold water,

20:06.375 --> 20:07.751
my life flashed

20:07.752 --> 20:09.125
before my eyes.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.105
Which was actually helpful,

20:11.106 --> 20:13.042
because my memory came back!

20:13.083 --> 20:14.334
- So, what do
- you remember?

20:14.375 --> 20:16.709
Well, I work on

20:16.710 --> 20:19.042
a cruise ship called

20:14.375 --> 20:19.042
the S.S. Delphina.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.042
- I dress as a mermaid
- and sing for the kids

20:21.083 --> 20:22.834
- When their parents
- hit the casino.

20:22.876 --> 20:23.960
So your name

20:23.961 --> 20:25.042
isn't Delphina?

20:25.083 --> 20:26.500
Nope. It's Kim.

20:26.542 --> 20:27.834
Ah!

20:27.876 --> 20:29.000
Kim Ross.

20:30.709 --> 20:32.518
- What were you - doing in the middle
- Of the ocean?

20:32.542 --> 20:33.834
The last thing I remember

20:33.835 --> 20:35.125
is that I went jet skiing

20:35.167 --> 20:36.292
to get away

20:36.293 --> 20:37.417
from all those kids.

20:37.459 --> 20:38.813
You have no idea

20:38.814 --> 20:40.167
how annoying they can be.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.083
Wanna bet?

20:44.209 --> 20:45.626
Anyway,

20:45.627 --> 20:47.042
I must have fallen off

20:44.209 --> 20:47.042
and hit my head.

20:47.083 --> 20:49.063
But what about

20:49.064 --> 20:51.042
your white-bearded dad

20:47.083 --> 20:51.042
with the giant fork?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.792
Isn't that Poseidon,

20:52.793 --> 20:54.500
king of the sea,

20:51.083 --> 20:54.500
with his trident?

20:54.542 --> 20:56.042
No, it's my dad Cletus,

20:56.083 --> 20:57.251
farmer of potatoes,

20:57.252 --> 20:58.417
with his pitchfork.

21:00.209 --> 21:01.667
I feel so stupid.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.042
Zuri,

21:05.083 --> 21:06.834
you are not stupid.

21:07.292 --> 21:08.417
Okay?

21:08.459 --> 21:09.543
Do you think maybe

21:09.544 --> 21:10.626
you just miss Millie?

21:11.083 --> 21:13.083
No.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.396
It just seems like

21:14.397 --> 21:15.667
a world without mermaids

21:13.125 --> 21:15.667
isn't as much fun.

21:15.709 --> 21:16.896
And if I don't have that,

21:16.897 --> 21:18.083
what do I have?

21:18.125 --> 21:20.000
- A private yacht and
- a really great nanny?

21:21.918 --> 21:23.042
True.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.272
Okay, just go ahead

21:24.273 --> 21:25.459
and say it.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.292
- You were right
- and I was wrong.

21:27.334 --> 21:28.730
There's no such

21:28.731 --> 21:30.125
thing as mermaids.

21:30.167 --> 21:31.334
Actually,

21:31.335 --> 21:32.500
there might be.

21:30.167 --> 21:32.500
What?

21:32.542 --> 21:34.167
- Yeah. I mean,
- it's like Ravi said,

21:34.209 --> 21:35.376
So much of the world

21:35.377 --> 21:36.542
is yet to be explored.

21:36.584 --> 21:38.042
- Who's to say
- what's out there?

21:38.083 --> 21:39.583
So you don't think

21:39.584 --> 21:41.083
I'm just

21:38.083 --> 21:41.083
a crazy little kid?

21:41.125 --> 21:42.792
Absolutely not.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.480
I think you're

21:44.481 --> 21:46.125
an amazing young woman

21:42.834 --> 21:46.125
with a great imagination.

21:46.167 --> 21:47.685
- It's one of the things
- I love most about you.

21:47.709 --> 21:49.042
And no matter how old you get,

21:49.043 --> 21:50.375
I hope you never lose that.

21:50.417 --> 21:51.876
I won't.

21:51.918 --> 21:53.439
I plan to be

21:53.440 --> 21:54.959
an eccentric old lady

21:51.918 --> 21:54.959
with 16 imaginary cats.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
(BOTH LAUGH)

21:58.125 --> 21:59.418
I'm really sorry

21:59.419 --> 22:00.709
to disappoint you, Zuri.

22:00.751 --> 22:02.063
That's okay.

22:02.064 --> 22:03.375
We can still be friends,

22:03.417 --> 22:05.314
even if all you have

22:05.315 --> 22:07.209
is boring old legs.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.730
And if you ever

22:08.731 --> 22:10.209
come to New York,

22:07.250 --> 22:10.209
we can still go shopping.

22:10.250 --> 22:11.250
We all can.

22:12.125 --> 22:14.167
And we can still get married.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.876
I hope you don't mind,

22:15.877 --> 22:17.542
I registered us

22:14.209 --> 22:17.542
at Paintball Plus.

22:19.167 --> 22:20.417
Every girl's dream.

22:21.542 --> 22:23.250
I still do not understand.

22:23.292 --> 22:24.460
My experiment

22:24.461 --> 22:25.626
was flawless!

22:25.667 --> 22:26.959
Um, Ravi,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.602
- did you ever think
- maybe Delphina's saliva

22:28.626 --> 22:30.250
- Came up positive
- for fish because

22:30.292 --> 22:32.492
- That's what we - were having for dinner
- At the time?

22:32.542 --> 22:34.375
Ah, yes.

22:34.417 --> 22:35.730
That would explain why

22:35.731 --> 22:37.042
she also tested positive

22:37.083 --> 22:38.355
for tartar sauce

22:38.356 --> 22:39.626
and a squeeze of lemon.

22:46.876 --> 22:50.000
Whoa! Best vacation ever!

22:54.417 --> 22:56.126
Hey, how about you put

22:56.127 --> 22:57.834
a little sunscreen on me,

22:54.417 --> 22:57.834
hot stuff?

23:01.083 --> 23:02.167
(SIGHS)

23:02.709 --> 23:03.709
(YELPS) Ravi!

23:06.083 --> 23:07.250
What are you doing?

23:07.292 --> 23:08.876
You said,

23:08.918 --> 23:10.459
"Hey, how about you

23:10.460 --> 23:12.000
put a little sunscreen

23:08.918 --> 23:12.000
on me, hot stuff?"

23:12.042 --> 23:13.146
Who else could you possibly

23:13.147 --> 23:14.250
be referring to?

23:16.792 --> 23:18.913
- Tell you what, - you keep dreaming,
- And so will I.
