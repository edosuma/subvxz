WEBVTT

00:00.767 --> 00:03.168
- ( knocking )
- coming.

00:05.605 --> 00:08.073
Here's your daughter.
I'm done with her.

00:08.075 --> 00:09.641
Turns out I'm stupid,

00:09.643 --> 00:11.643
I don't get it,
and I never will.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.113
Wait a minute.
When I dropped her
off at your house,

00:14.115 --> 00:16.615
I was stupid,
I don't get it,
and I never will.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.385
Man, just when
you think you're special.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.720
You're both horrible,
horrible people.

00:21.722 --> 00:25.157
Is that an upgrade
from stupid?

00:25.159 --> 00:26.592
You mind if I check
the score of the game?

00:26.594 --> 00:29.495
I don't mind,
but you might want to bolt.

00:29.497 --> 00:32.631
Your ex-girlfriend
lori is in the kitchen.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.434
Wait a minute.
"no birth control" lori?

00:35.436 --> 00:39.138
That didn't catch on,
so she just goes by lori now.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.773
Don't worry about it.
We're fine.

00:40.775 --> 00:43.075
Even though she thinks
psychotherapy is a scam,

00:43.077 --> 00:45.744
But believes in ghosts,
astrology, and aliens,

00:45.746 --> 00:47.279
I really liked her.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.148
So what are you guys up to?

00:49.150 --> 00:51.183
We're working on
a new business.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.519
- Cofftea.
- Cofftea?

00:53.521 --> 00:55.721
Are you tired
of having to decide

00:55.723 --> 00:58.424
Between having a cup of coffee
or a cup of tea?

00:58.426 --> 01:00.092
No.

01:00.094 --> 01:03.228
I know, I can never
decide either.

01:03.230 --> 01:07.166
So say good-bye to
painful indecisiveness
with cofftea.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.368
Just brew-steep up
a fresh pot-kettle

01:09.370 --> 01:12.171
Of coffee-flavored tea
and you can have both.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.705
How's that sound?

01:13.707 --> 01:16.742
Like I'd rather live with
painful indecisiveness.

01:18.178 --> 01:19.845
Jen, there's a problem.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.247
The pot-kettle's acting weird
and it isn't brew-steeping.

01:22.249 --> 01:26.585
Then you better get
back in there before it
starts fire-smoking.

01:26.587 --> 01:30.756
I knew I shouldn't have
listened to that stupid korean
woman at the nail shop.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.692
If it's such a sure thing,
why is she still scrubbing feet?

01:36.629 --> 01:37.863
Hey, charlie.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.132
Nice to see you, lori.
You look great.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.667
Thanks.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.836
This is such
a weird coincidence.

01:43.838 --> 01:45.771
I was just thinking about
calling you the other day.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.706
But you can't
use the phone

01:47.708 --> 01:50.142
When the moon
is in the second phase
of capricorn?

01:50.144 --> 01:52.811
Oh, god, that is such
a pisces thing to say.

01:52.813 --> 01:56.348
( laughs )
no, I just didn't like
how we left everything.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.584
I shouldn't have
scared you off

01:58.586 --> 02:03.355
Oh, don't beat yourself up.
There was a lot more
to it than that.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.824
Uh, like what?

02:05.826 --> 02:08.594
If you won't let me lie,
I can't make you feel better.

02:08.596 --> 02:12.431
I think I just said that
as a defense mechanism

02:12.433 --> 02:14.233
Because I have
a fear of intimacy.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.468
Defense mechanism?
Fear of intimacy?

02:16.470 --> 02:19.138
Sounds like someone is changing
their mind about therapy.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.907
Well, I did read
a "psychology today"

02:21.909 --> 02:24.610
While I was waiting to be
fitted for my new diaphragm.

02:24.612 --> 02:28.447
Fitted? I thought
those things were just
kind of off the rack.

02:28.449 --> 02:32.151
Aw, mr. Goodson,
you have so much to learn.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.153
How about
I come over Wednesday

02:34.155 --> 02:35.921
And give you
some private tutoring?

02:35.923 --> 02:38.590
You mean sex, right?

02:38.592 --> 02:40.592
'cause the last time a woman
offered me private tutoring,

02:40.594 --> 02:42.261
There was a huge
misunderstanding.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.562
I wound up learning calculus.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.499
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

02:53.239 --> 02:54.940
It's called cofftea.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.743
Oh, my god.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.912
How come jen never invents--

02:59.914 --> 03:03.448
Oh, my god!
There's an aftertaste.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.585
You think it's gone...
But it's not.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.555
That's the tea.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.323
I've got to get going.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.859
Before you do,
there's something I want
to talk to you about.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.394
Remember lori?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.663
You mean "the romantic
girl of your dreams

03:17.665 --> 03:19.498
Except she was
a lunatic" lori?

03:19.500 --> 03:22.467
Yeah, that didn't catch on.
She's just going by lori now.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.571
Her and I are gonna
give it another shot.

03:25.573 --> 03:29.975
So it would probably
make sense for us to put
our thing on hold.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.911
Look, I have no problem
honoring our agreement

03:32.913 --> 03:34.479
As long as it's
a viable candidate,

03:34.481 --> 03:36.515
But you've already tried
capturing this unicorn,

03:36.517 --> 03:38.550
Which I'm sure she also
believes in,

03:38.552 --> 03:40.219
And failed.

03:40.221 --> 03:44.256
So why can't you just be happy
with our amazing arrangement?

03:44.258 --> 03:47.526
I am, but you know
that I want more--

03:48.461 --> 03:50.295
More cofftea.

03:50.297 --> 03:52.397
Jen, you've got to make
a big cup for kate.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.966
She's gonna love it.

03:53.968 --> 03:56.468
I've got to start group.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.837
- Hey, kate.
- Hey, jen.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.672
No time for coffee.
I'm on my way out.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.374
Okay.
Oh, hey, don't forget

04:02.376 --> 04:04.409
We've still got to do
that girls' night out.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.978
Just let me know
when you're ready.

04:05.980 --> 04:09.448
Does this girls' night out
involve picking up guys?

04:09.450 --> 04:11.917
If it doesn't,
I don't know why
we're going.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.919
Great.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.988
Then I'm ready.
How about tomorrow?

04:15.990 --> 04:18.624
Awesome.
I always go to el tostada.

04:18.626 --> 04:21.760
It's loaded with guys.
There's a guitar store
down the street

04:21.762 --> 04:26.999
Good, because I am
not looking for anything
deep or meaningful.

04:27.001 --> 04:29.334
No, if you want deep
and meaningful,

04:29.336 --> 04:31.703
You have to go
to the el tostada
by the law school.

04:33.039 --> 04:36.008
Everything's a negotiation,
but it's worth it.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.014
Sorry I'm late.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.582
I had to walk here.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.350
Why?
I thought you were
driving everywhere

04:45.352 --> 04:47.386
Because you sold
advertising space
on your car.

04:47.388 --> 04:50.022
I was.
I just ran out of gas.

04:50.024 --> 04:52.858
And now it's stuck in front
of a yoga studio.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.294
Well, vagisil is really getting
their money's worth today.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.397
Lacey, anything
you'd like to share?

04:58.399 --> 05:00.365
Yeah, I'm sick of guys

05:00.367 --> 05:02.768
Misrepresenting
themselves as rich.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.736
It's so superficial.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.306
But instead of getting
stuck in anger,

05:07.308 --> 05:10.709
I registered on
richguysonlyforsure.Com.

05:10.711 --> 05:14.579
It's a website for women
who want to date rich guys only.

05:14.581 --> 05:17.049
For sure.

05:17.051 --> 05:20.886
Lacey, you are a horrible
judge of character and this
isn't going to help.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.689
Instead of picking losers
in gin-soaked bars,

05:23.691 --> 05:26.958
You'll be picking losers
in your gin-soaked home.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.860
Hey, that is so...

05:28.862 --> 05:30.962
True.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.098
I just want what
everyone else wants--

05:33.100 --> 05:36.802
A deep, meaningful relationship
with a billionaire.

05:36.804 --> 05:42.441
I bet I can get on
that site and I can find you
a great guy like that.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.409
I'll bet you 100 bucks

05:44.411 --> 05:47.079
That I can do it
better than you.

05:47.081 --> 05:50.048
I don't care
nothing about lacey,
but I just like gambling.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.786
Oh, please.
Like you guys know me
better than me.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.788
I spend all day
thinking about me.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.791
You spend, like, what,
maybe two or three hours
a day thinking about me.

06:01.394 --> 06:03.095
That's only because
nolan's 18 hours a day

06:03.097 --> 06:06.465
Messes with the average.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.433
But I do think that this
is a worthy experiment.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.736
Sometimes other people
can be more objective

06:10.738 --> 06:12.371
About what we need
than we are.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.106
As soon as I get
my vagisil check,

06:14.108 --> 06:18.510
I will pay everybody $20
not to do this.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.881
Okay, so here's the plan.
I'll give each of you
my password,

06:22.883 --> 06:24.416
You pretend you're me,

06:24.418 --> 06:26.385
And whoever picks
the best catch wins.

06:26.387 --> 06:29.421
Remember, guys, everything
you put on the internet
stays there forever.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.591
So when you represent lacey
online, be very careful
to protect her dignity.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.659
Yes, please.
Oh, and by the way,

06:34.661 --> 06:37.028
If the guy is worth
more than 10 million,

06:37.030 --> 06:40.499
That unlocks a private photo
gallery of racy photos

06:40.501 --> 06:43.535
Of me in the desert
doing stuff on a car.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.505
Okay, so dignity is
not an issue.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.542
Let's just not give out
her home address.

06:55.448 --> 06:57.916
So, was that okay?

06:57.918 --> 07:01.586
Oh, yeah.
It was super.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.824
Super?

07:05.826 --> 07:07.159
Really?

07:07.161 --> 07:09.828
I'm just quiet.
Is that okay?

07:09.830 --> 07:11.530
I love quiet.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.566
And the quiet went perfectly
with the not moving.

07:15.802 --> 07:19.471
Oh, don't you
worry about me.
I am great.

07:19.473 --> 07:22.107
I just want you
to enjoy yourself.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.009
See, here's the thing.

07:24.011 --> 07:27.546
A big part of my good time
is knowing that you're
having a good time.

07:27.548 --> 07:31.049
Then you just had one of
the best sexual experiences

07:31.051 --> 07:33.185
Of your life, buddy.

07:33.187 --> 07:34.986
Oh, good.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.122
Thanks for letting me know.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.960
I'm telling you,
this woman has got it all.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.796
She's smart, funny,
and when I got her into bed--

07:44.798 --> 07:47.966
Tell me everything.
Don't spare a detail.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.469
It was horrible.

07:50.471 --> 07:51.770
Like building
ikea furniture

07:51.772 --> 07:55.006
Without the fun
or sense of accomplishment.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.943
Wow, I did not
see that coming.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.946
I didn't either
and I was there.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.482
Well, sorry to hear that.

08:03.484 --> 08:07.052
And sort of secretly happy.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.988
I thought she was just
nervous the first time.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.757
We've gone a couple more
rounds and nothing's changed.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.659
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.895
I mean, can a relationship
survive if the sex is bad?

08:16.897 --> 08:20.565
Sure, it can limp
along for years before
you're divorced,

08:20.567 --> 08:22.968
Living alone, playing pool
with your neighbor

08:22.970 --> 08:24.970
And listening to him
complain about bad sex

08:24.972 --> 08:27.005
With a stone-cold fox.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.708
So that would be a no.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.878
A sad, sad no.

08:34.547 --> 08:36.848
I've got to break up
with her and I am not
looking forward to it.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.185
Just tell her during sex.
That way she won't
have a reaction.

08:43.589 --> 08:46.925
It's got to be weird.
So many fires happen
at night.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.628
You probably
save a lot of women
that are half dressed.

08:49.630 --> 08:53.031
Just throw them over
your shoulder and take
them back to your place.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.267
Pardon me?

08:55.269 --> 08:58.970
I mean, the hospital.

08:59.939 --> 09:01.873
How about you call me

09:01.875 --> 09:03.775
And we'll talk about it?

09:05.745 --> 09:07.913
I got a fireman's number.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.949
Let me guess, 9-1-1?

09:10.951 --> 09:13.685
- Are you okay?
- No.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.054
I am not okay.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.290
Guys have been all over you
since we walked in

09:18.292 --> 09:20.058
And not one guy
has hit on me.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.661
I think maybe
I just need someplace

09:22.663 --> 09:25.931
That's a little
more sophisticated
like an art gallery.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.733
Come on,
the night's young.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.135
Give it another chance.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.638
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.040
Is anybody sitting here?

09:35.042 --> 09:37.576
- No, it's all yours.
- Thanks.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.982
How you doing tonight?

09:43.984 --> 09:45.717
One second.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.319
Thursday at an art gallery.

09:47.321 --> 09:50.021
Good. How are you?

09:51.891 --> 09:54.025
Okay, I'm ready to hear
what you've got.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.161
Show me your rich guys.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.697
My rich guy is the son
of a shipping magnate

09:58.699 --> 10:01.232
And has accomplished
absolutely nothing on his own.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.970
He just runs around the world
spending his parents' money.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.172
Ooh, let me see.
Oh!

10:07.174 --> 10:09.107
One day,
he hopes to settle down

10:09.109 --> 10:12.077
And enroll in dj school.

10:12.079 --> 10:15.013
Follow that,
edward shakyhands.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.115
My young feller

10:17.117 --> 10:20.118
Selflessly gives back
to his community.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.988
<i>This former new jersey</i>
<i>state trooper</i>

10:22.990 --> 10:25.857
Was decorated twice
for valor.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.926
Why are you still talking?

10:27.928 --> 10:29.828
Why?
( laughs )

10:29.830 --> 10:31.963
Because deputy dipstick here

10:31.965 --> 10:33.965
Slipped on a grape
in a supermarket

10:33.967 --> 10:37.369
And won a lawsuit
for $30 million.

10:37.371 --> 10:40.038
Ta-ra-ra-boom,
you're gay.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.742
This is very close.
Nolan, you're up.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.077
This devil-may-care
rapscallion

10:46.079 --> 10:48.213
Plays by his own rules.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.182
He's handsome
and debonair.

10:53.052 --> 10:55.120
At home in the boardroom
and the bedroom.

10:55.122 --> 10:58.156
<i>This young man</i>
<i>boasts assets that include</i>
<i>but are not limited to</i>

10:58.158 --> 11:00.959
His own car.

11:00.961 --> 11:04.229
Oh, nolan.
Sweet, desperate nolan.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.364
No.
I'm going with patrick's.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.034
Please go out with him.
I'm begging you.

11:09.036 --> 11:12.437
You could keep the $100.
That's how rich he is.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.241
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>
<i>- coming.</i>

11:18.979 --> 11:22.280
What are you doing here?
I thought we were gonna
meet at the restaurant.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.449
I know,
but my psychic said

11:24.451 --> 11:28.086
That you had a big surprise
for me and I couldn't wait.

11:28.088 --> 11:31.089
Wow, I'm starting
to believe in psychics.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.091
Are we going somewhere?

11:33.093 --> 11:35.960
I'm not.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.429
Look, lori,

11:37.431 --> 11:39.731
Sometimes surprises

11:39.733 --> 11:42.233
Don't seem
great right away,

11:42.235 --> 11:44.269
But they turn out
terrific.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.072
For example, the titanic
hits an iceberg.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.874
Terrible surprise,
couple years later,
box office gold.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.776
Are you breaking up with me?

11:51.778 --> 11:54.479
( stammering )
I'm sorry, lori.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.449
I think you're fantastic.

11:57.451 --> 12:01.052
It's just I don't think
we have very good
chemistry in bed.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.054
I'm not saying that sex
is the only thing, but--

12:03.056 --> 12:05.156
But it is
what's breaking us up.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.058
Well, that
and the religious
differences.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.227
We don't have any
religious differences.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.162
Well, then, yeah,
it's the sex.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.798
Why? Because I don't
make noises

12:13.800 --> 12:15.800
And thrash around
like some kind of animal?

12:15.802 --> 12:19.070
Well, you don't
have to make it sound
so base, but yes.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.139
( scoffs )
you know what?

12:21.141 --> 12:23.141
I just want you to know
that up until now,

12:23.143 --> 12:24.809
I haven't had
any complaints.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.178
Have you had
any compliments?

12:27.180 --> 12:29.247
Uh, have you?

12:29.249 --> 12:32.217
Hey, hey, I can show you
taped testimonials.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.818
You're a pig.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.820
Hey, at least a pig
grunts every now and again.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.922
- Screw you.
- Screw you.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.358
- I'd love to.
- Are you serious?

12:40.360 --> 12:42.227
Yes!

12:44.998 --> 12:48.099
I shouldn't have told you
how great the sex was.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.834
No, it's okay.
We're in session.

12:49.836 --> 12:53.505
I am not bothered by
the "volume of the noises,

12:53.507 --> 12:55.540
Your college-like
turgidity,"

12:55.542 --> 12:58.910
Or that at one point
you had "an out-of-body
experience."

12:58.912 --> 13:01.012
Well, to be fair,
that was just for a second.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.947
We were changing
positions.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.417
What I'm concerned about is that
you're going out with a woman

13:06.419 --> 13:09.888
Who's only able to have
good sex when she's angry.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.824
That's not true.
The anger just unlocked
her passion.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.326
She's incredibly
inhibited and our fight
gave her permission

13:15.328 --> 13:16.861
To get in touch
with herself,

13:16.863 --> 13:19.030
Which at one point
she did while I watched.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.501
Charlie, don't you see
that there's a problem?

13:23.503 --> 13:25.403
Yeah, I see that
there's a problem. You.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.939
For the first time in a while,
I'm in a promising relationship

13:27.941 --> 13:30.208
And, surprise, you find
something wrong with it.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.544
I am not jealous.

13:32.546 --> 13:35.814
So if you think that
I am sitting home alone

13:35.816 --> 13:38.583
Not getting hit on
by firemen and musicians,

13:38.585 --> 13:42.487
Rest assured
that that is not the case.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.923
Wait a minute.
Firemen? Musicians?

13:44.925 --> 13:47.992
You went
to el tostada with jen.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.029
I go for the food.

13:52.064 --> 13:55.033
Ed, I need your rich
loser's number.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.835
Too late.
He's gone.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.603
I kept him hanging
pretty good, though.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.305
I made some promises

14:00.307 --> 14:02.407
That you ought
to be ashamed of.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.476
Well, patrick's guy
stood me up.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.445
Oh, hey, lacey.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.948
What happened?
I thought you had
this all lined up.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.149
I thought this was
the perfect guy.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.484
He is,
just not for you.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.619
How do you know?

14:14.621 --> 14:16.855
Because I figured
I would meet him.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.424
You know,
screen him for you.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.126
But, you know,
one thing led to another

14:22.128 --> 14:25.163
And suffice it to say
he's fully screened.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.132
You slept with my rich guy?

14:28.134 --> 14:31.002
A little.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.304
So what was he doing
on the straight dating site?

14:33.306 --> 14:34.639
His mom put him up there.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.641
Look, lacey, you have
no future with this guy.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.877
Well, how do you know?
Maybe he goes both ways.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.346
Oh, he does go both ways,
just not with women.

14:43.115 --> 14:45.116
See? This is way
more my scene.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.618
I know.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.887
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.623
- It's a great show--
- hey.

14:51.625 --> 14:54.959
- Hi.
- Really great show
tonight, huh?

14:54.961 --> 14:57.195
Hey, mr. Face.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.130
You just walked
right by me.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.366
Am I-- I mean, what--
something wrong with me?

15:01.368 --> 15:03.534
Am I not worthy of your time?
Am I not hot enough?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.637
Yeah, you're super hot.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.338
Yeah, you're damn right I am.
So what's your problem?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.641
You just give off a vibe
like you're with somebody.

15:09.643 --> 15:13.912
But if you're not,
I can understand why.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.084
Did you just hear that?
He said I was putting
off a vibe.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.154
I am not putting off a vibe.
Do you think I'm putting
off a vibe?

15:23.156 --> 15:25.023
I don't know.
Are you seeing someone?

15:25.025 --> 15:27.558
No. I mean,
I was sleeping
with somebody,

15:27.560 --> 15:29.127
But we're not even
doing that anymore.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.963
Wow, that must have been
some powerful sex

15:31.965 --> 15:33.965
If the vibe is still there.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.166
Are you done with him?

15:35.168 --> 15:38.102
I've got to lose this vibe.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.407
Hi.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.475
Hi.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.045
So what do you say we go
back to my place

15:47.047 --> 15:49.681
And have a couple drinks
and whatever happens happens?

15:49.683 --> 15:52.283
And I think you know
what's gonna happen.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.422
Sex.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.591
Oh, you are so hot.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.427
Oh, thanks.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.429
I'm gonna rip this shirt
off with my teeth.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.230
Oh, no, no.
Don't do that.

16:06.232 --> 16:09.300
I just got this.
Do you like it?

16:11.036 --> 16:13.972
I am on fire.
Keep going.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.441
Are you sure?
Doesn't feel like
you're on fire.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.043
Oh, I am.
Grr.

16:22.414 --> 16:25.283
You know what?

16:25.285 --> 16:27.251
I hate the way you laugh.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.253
What?

16:29.255 --> 16:31.189
Yeah, it's one of the worst
sounds I've ever heard.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.358
And I spent a summer
working in a slaughterhouse.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.595
- Why are you being so mean?
- Why are you being
so sensitive?

16:37.597 --> 16:39.230
- I'm not.
- And defensive.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.332
I don't understand
what's going on with you.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.067
'cause you're not
very bright.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.736
You are such a jerk.

16:44.738 --> 16:47.038
That's what
I'm talking about.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.007
- Say my name.
- Screw you.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.308
Screw you.

16:54.646 --> 16:57.048
I want you so bad!

16:57.050 --> 16:58.349
Ahh!

17:00.019 --> 17:01.452
I am so turned on
right now.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.689
- I know, that's the problem.
- Not for me.

17:06.592 --> 17:09.460
Lori, we need to have
a serious talk.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.295
Oh, my god,
do you want me or not?

17:11.297 --> 17:12.697
Okay, but then after,
we have to have
a serious talk.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.532
Okay.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.100
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

17:16.102 --> 17:19.103
I'm sorry.
We can't do this.

17:19.105 --> 17:22.807
You're turned on by anger
and it's just not healthy.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.442
I'm not angry.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.345
I'm just aroused,
you dumbass.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.114
See? That is not the kind
of thing you'd call someone
you care about.

17:30.116 --> 17:33.151
There are no valentine's day
cards that start, "you dumbass."

17:33.153 --> 17:35.153
Ugh, are we doing this
or aren't we?

17:35.155 --> 17:38.089
( sighs )
we aren't.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.757
I really care
about you, sweetie,

17:39.759 --> 17:43.227
But, well,
you need therapy.

17:46.799 --> 17:50.134
I'll tell you what.
I'll talk to my astrologer

17:50.136 --> 17:52.336
And if she says
the stars are aligned,

17:52.338 --> 17:54.839
I'll ask my psychic
to see if my spirit guide

17:54.841 --> 17:57.375
Says it's okay
for me to go to therapy.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.110
Great.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.378
And then can you send
all three of them here

18:00.380 --> 18:02.780
So they can help me turn
this table back over?

18:04.149 --> 18:06.517
I hope you don't have
a heart condition.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.420
'cause you are about
to spend one wild night

18:09.422 --> 18:12.790
With a single, unattached,
unencumbered woman.

18:12.792 --> 18:16.227
No baggage,
free as a bird.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.629
Yup, there's not a man,
not one.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.666
Not a man.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.335
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're starting to scare
me a little bit here.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.171
No, no, no.
I'm just saying
there's no one else.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.873
- It's just you and me.
- Yeah?

18:28.875 --> 18:32.143
Well, great.
'cause I'm really
looking forward to this.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.881
Uh, no.
Not the bed.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.850
Right, not the bed.
Where?

18:38.852 --> 18:41.886
- Uh, maybe the chair.
- Yeah, chair's good.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.788
Yeah.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.123
Okay.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.390
No, get on the floor.

18:46.392 --> 18:49.260
Yeah, perfect.

18:49.262 --> 18:52.663
- No.
- Bathroom? Kitchen?

18:52.665 --> 18:54.866
No, no.
It's not the where.

18:54.868 --> 18:56.400
It's the who.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.871
I'm sorry.
I am kind of involved.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.772
I mean, not involved.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.208
I mean, technically,
there's no guy,

19:04.210 --> 19:06.878
- But there's a guy.
- I get it.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.346
How about the roof?

19:21.660 --> 19:24.262
( keys clicking )

19:26.198 --> 19:28.332
<i>( phone chimes )</i>
