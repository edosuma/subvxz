Who picked this dump?

00:08.218 --> 00:09.427
LOU: You suggested it.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.222
I suggested
you look into it.

00:12.347 --> 00:13.765
Sorry,
the online reviews...

00:13.890 --> 00:16.726
Were obviously written by some geek
in their own marketing department.

do you guys need me.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.792
Nine men?

00:40.917 --> 00:43.837
No one thought it might be a good idea
to put a suit on one of the gals

00:43.962 --> 00:46.256
from the steno pool to make
it look like you give a damn?

00:46.381 --> 00:48.800

you have me standing beside you.

Which is good, because your problem
is a national problem.

respect, Miss Michener,

00:56.433 --> 00:59.811
I'd hardly call a few isolated
incidents a national problem.

you talked to him?

it was after...

tread on your turf.

to close the blinds.

03:05.061 --> 03:06.771
Just got a call
from Patty Michener,

03:06.896 --> 03:08.439
from Women's Majority,
the women's rights...

03:08.565 --> 03:11.150
- We know who she is.
- I dated her.

03:11.276 --> 03:12.694
Well,
not really dated her,

03:12.819 --> 03:15.989
more metaphorically raped her
by having a penis.

03:16.114 --> 03:18.533
- You did, too.
- Her assistant flipped out,

03:18.658 --> 03:21.411
ripped off her clothes
in front of a roomful of businessmen.

03:21.536 --> 03:23.121
Either she cracked under the whip,

03:23.246 --> 03:26.249
or she started to realize
that her evolutionary purpose

03:26.374 --> 03:28.626
is to arouse men,
not to castrate them.

03:28.751 --> 03:29.752
Send her to psychiatric...

03:29.878 --> 03:31.379
Anemia, bradycardia,

03:31.504 --> 03:34.966
and abdominal pain
aren't psychiatric symptoms.

03:35.091 --> 03:38.595
Then it's the latter,
send her to my apartment.

03:38.720 --> 03:39.971
I'll give it to Segal.

and you're saying no?

03:42.348 --> 03:44.893

things to do.

03:45.018 --> 03:47.061
Sorry, can't help you.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.772
You need a specialist
to remove those kinds of warts.

and a stubborn refusal
to shave her pits.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.374
Have you seen Wilson?

04:08.499 --> 04:12.128
No, but I have seen
the patient's frequent flyer balance.

No fever means it's

If it's not where she went,
maybe it's the work hours.

04:20.595 --> 04:21.971
Could be amphetamine abuse.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.015
She's probably popping
them like breath mints.

04:24.140 --> 04:25.475
You haven't been by
his office?

04:25.600 --> 04:29.646

Tox screen's cleaner

04:33.232 --> 04:34.525

constantly on the road,

04:34.651 --> 04:38.237
probably living off of
airline peanuts and diet soda.

a strong career woman's been made sick

04:45.578 --> 04:47.705
It's not B12.
It's an insulinoma in her pancreas,

04:47.830 --> 04:49.248
it's making her hypoglycemic.

04:49.374 --> 04:52.752
(SIGHS) Great, now everyone knows.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.838
You knew
the patient had cancer?

04:55.964 --> 04:57.840
Is that what she said?

04:57.966 --> 04:59.425
I thought she said,

04:59.550 --> 05:02.553
"I'm suddenly and irrationally defending
the patient's strong career,

05:02.679 --> 05:05.223
"even though in reality
she's just a glorified grunt

05:05.348 --> 05:07.517
"because I'm trying to convince myself
that it's okay not to have a life,

05:07.642 --> 05:10.520
"'cause I don't have a life,
because I was tested for Huntington's

05:10.645 --> 05:12.897
"and my life span's
been cut in half."

I don't have Huntington's.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.890
Are you lying to us?
Because it's none of our business.

05:48.016 --> 05:50.101
If it's none of your business,
I shouldn't have to answer questions.

05:50.226 --> 05:51.936
And I wouldn't have to,
except House doesn't want to answer

05:52.061 --> 05:53.312

lose some shut-eye,

06:21.007 --> 06:23.926
I pound my legs clawing
at imaginary ant colonies.

06:25.094 --> 06:26.596
You have a severe
B12 deficiency.

06:26.721 --> 06:28.556
Get back in bed.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.198
I'm sure your boss
can do without you for a few days.

06:45.323 --> 06:48.242
It's not about her,
it's about me.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.453
I want to be there,
I want to matter.

06:50.578 --> 06:54.457
Yeah, I mean, without you, who knows how
much starch they'd put in her shirts?

06:56.125 --> 06:57.877
I'm sorry, I'm sure your boss
depends on you for...

06:58.002 --> 06:59.587
- I need to get up.
- No, you need to stay in bed.

06:59.712 --> 07:03.758
Please, where's the bed pan?
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, I just...

07:04.550 --> 07:06.302
I just had
a bowel movement.

07:06.427 --> 07:09.472
It's okay,
B12 deficiency can cause sudden...

07:12.100 --> 07:14.352
That's not a bowel movement.

07:19.357 --> 07:24.237
My patient is still fighting in the
feminist trenches, but the war is over.

07:24.362 --> 07:27.240
Yesterday's sluts are
today's empowered women,

07:27.365 --> 07:30.493
today's sluts are celebrities.
If that isn't progress...

07:30.618 --> 07:31.994
I'm leaving.

07:33.830 --> 07:35.873

another two months?

07:35.998 --> 07:38.960
Boy, you're really milking
this bereavement thing, aren't you?

07:40.795 --> 07:43.506
I mean, good for you.
Take all the time you need.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.590
I'm resigning.

07:45.842 --> 07:48.553
Maybe moving out of New Jersey,
I don't know yet.

07:48.678 --> 07:52.140
Okay, that's
an understandable reaction.

07:52.265 --> 07:54.183
It's not a reaction,
it's a decision.

08:14.579 --> 08:15.913
Did yours?

08:16.038 --> 08:17.623
Physical pain is different.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.542
I'd rather have
my leg chopped off.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.918
You don't know that
'cause you haven't felt...

08:21.043 --> 08:22.295
Neither have you.

- We need you to...

08:28.301 --> 08:30.219
Actually, as you can see,
I'm not busy.

08:30.344 --> 08:33.181
It was just a euphemism
for "get the hell out of here."

08:37.602 --> 08:41.981
This is your grief talking,
and, yeah, it is a bit textbook.

08:42.106 --> 08:44.859
So before you give away all your
possessions to the Salvation Army...

08:44.984 --> 08:46.068
My girlfriend's dead.

08:46.194 --> 08:48.696
I'm glad you've read
that book before, I haven't.

08:48.821 --> 08:52.116
I'm late to meet Dr. Olan to brief him
on the case I'm handing over.

08:55.828 --> 08:57.079
Bye.

09:09.759 --> 09:11.177
It doesn't bother you
that House wouldn't take

09:11.302 --> 09:13.179
just two seconds
to talk about the patient?

09:13.304 --> 09:14.597
Wilson's dealing with a lot.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.932
And our patient may be dying.

09:16.057 --> 09:18.267
She was bleeding out her rear,
we're looking up her rear.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.603
You think we needed House's expertise
to set us on this course?

09:20.728 --> 09:22.438
Her heart rate's slow,
bleed should have made it faster.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.690
And it can wait
till after we know where it came from.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.859
And after he's done
dealing with personal issues.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.361
Yeah?
That the way it works around here?

09:28.486 --> 09:31.447
We get cut slack
while we deal with personal issues?

09:33.449 --> 09:34.825
You're not the boss.

09:34.951 --> 09:39.330
Boss gets to make the rules,
boss gets to ignore...

09:40.665 --> 09:44.460
She's bleeding from nowhere.

09:46.545 --> 09:47.672
You did an endoscopy?

09:47.797 --> 09:48.923
And a colonoscopy.

09:49.048 --> 09:50.091
- CT scan?
- Ordered.

09:50.216 --> 09:51.884
But it shouldn't show anything
the endoscopy didn't.

09:52.009 --> 09:54.428
- We can't do a CT scan.
- Why not?

09:54.553 --> 09:56.681
We don't need a CT scan,
we don't need House.

09:56.806 --> 09:57.932
Stop grinning and talk.

09:58.057 --> 10:00.142
One of the routine pre-procedure tests
was positive.

10:00.268 --> 10:02.311
- Which one?
- The one that if it's positive

10:02.436 --> 10:03.896
would explain
a hormone imbalance

10:04.021 --> 10:06.190
that could screw
with heart rate and blood flow.

10:08.317 --> 10:10.736
Guess she does have a life
beyond her career.

10:12.113 --> 10:13.447

10:13.572 --> 10:15.032
You want to call the father?
Let him know?

10:15.157 --> 10:18.160
Soon as you do some DNA testing,
let me know.

10:19.829 --> 10:21.622
Must be hard to have
a real relationship when you're...

10:21.747 --> 10:23.916
(CHUCKLES)
Are you making excuses for me?

10:24.041 --> 10:25.209
I'm just saying
it's understandable.

10:25.334 --> 10:28.504
You only have to understand something
if it needs an explanation.

10:28.629 --> 10:31.841
I have needs, I met my needs,
end of explanation.

10:31.966 --> 10:34.427
How recently were you needy?

10:34.552 --> 10:38.180
(SIGHS)
It's been two or three months at least.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.268
What? What is it?

10:42.393 --> 10:43.394
Nothing.

10:43.519 --> 10:46.397
- Tell me.
- It's actually, nothing.

10:49.233 --> 10:52.737
The ultrasound
shows no trace of a baby at all.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.450
Positive pregnancy test,
no pregnancy.

10:58.284 --> 11:01.329
B12 deficit rectified,
but her heart's slowing even more.

11:01.454 --> 11:03.706
And a bleed should
speed her heart rate.

11:07.626 --> 11:10.046
House,
this is the kind of case you love,

11:10.171 --> 11:12.298
contradictions piling up left and right.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.635
Two false positive pregnancy tests,

11:16.761 --> 11:19.930
bradycardia,
lower GI bleed. Go.

11:20.056 --> 11:22.516
Choriocarcinoma,
would've triggered pregnancy hormones.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.226
Also would've shown on the sonogram.

11:24.352 --> 11:26.520
KUTNER:
lmmunoglobulin A deficiency.

11:26.645 --> 11:27.646
No urinary bleed.

11:27.772 --> 11:31.567
If she's had beta-HCG injections,
they can cross-react with...

11:32.860 --> 11:34.362
Keep going.

11:37.323 --> 11:39.241
You're being an idiot.

11:39.367 --> 11:41.786
You're gonna blow up your career,
then six months from now,

11:41.911 --> 11:44.163
when you've moved on
from Amber to burnt sienna,

11:44.288 --> 11:48.459
you're gonna be stuck on a mobile
oncology truck in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.

11:48.584 --> 11:51.796
I'd need a flow chart
to explain all the ways in which

11:51.921 --> 11:53.756
that was ridiculously insensitive.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.091
You can't hide from misery.

11:55.216 --> 11:56.926
This isn't your business.

11:57.051 --> 11:59.428
My skull was cracked open
trying to save her.

11:59.553 --> 12:03.682
Then we all need a little tea
and sympathy. I'm through discussing it.

12:05.101 --> 12:05.976
We have a patient.

12:06.102 --> 12:08.729
Who's obviously not going anywhere
with a bloody rectum.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.648
- Great to have you back.
- Actually, I'm...

12:10.773 --> 12:14.402
Actually, he's about to thrust a tanto
into the belly of his career.

12:14.527 --> 12:16.320
I'm leaving the hospital.

12:17.238 --> 12:18.781
I'm sorry. This is obviously
a terrible time, but...

12:18.906 --> 12:20.616
Why are you leaving?

12:20.741 --> 12:22.785
I just need
a change of scenery.

12:22.910 --> 12:23.828
Buy a plant.

12:23.953 --> 12:26.247
Rectal bleeding,
two positive pregnancy tests.

12:26.372 --> 12:27.540
There's nothing we can do...

12:27.665 --> 12:30.042
You could ask House to be a grownup
and respect my decision.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.002
I respect things
that deserve respect.

12:32.128 --> 12:34.505
This decision, on the other hand,
is a dog wearing a cape.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.048
Hallucinations,
heart rate won't respond...

12:36.173 --> 12:38.384
The patient tested positive
for pregnancy

12:38.509 --> 12:40.886
because the patient is pregnant.

12:46.517 --> 12:47.518
(BANGING)

12:54.567 --> 12:55.818
Hey, who are you?

12:55.943 --> 12:56.902
This is Dr. House.

12:57.027 --> 13:00.030
He's too brilliant for introductions.
False positive.

13:00.156 --> 13:02.533
You're too busy to be running
a day care center in your abdomen.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.201
False positive.

13:04.326 --> 13:06.495
Not to mention, you should wait
till at least 30 to punish

13:06.620 --> 13:09.623
that pleasure portal
with a seven-pound tissue expander.

13:09.748 --> 13:13.002
I'm 37.
And I thought I wasn't pregnant.

13:13.752 --> 13:17.214
Thirty-seven? Impressive.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.552
Too bad you're not
passing on those genes.

13:23.012 --> 13:25.014
Does that look false to you?

13:25.890 --> 13:27.892
You were looking
in the wrong room.

13:28.559 --> 13:30.811
It's more common
when the egg lands in the oven,

13:30.936 --> 13:32.563
sometimes it winds up
in the fallopian tubes,

13:32.688 --> 13:35.900
in rare cases, it plummets through
the plumbing entirely.

13:36.025 --> 13:37.943
It's using her intestine
as a blood supply.

13:38.068 --> 13:42.781
Caused the rectal bleed,
and now Junior Miss Steinem's junior

13:42.907 --> 13:46.744
must be pressing on her vagus nerve,
slowing her heart to a crawl.

13:46.869 --> 13:50.623
Yank the fetus. If she survives
the surgery, she'll be fine.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.594
What if she wants
to keep the baby?

14:03.719 --> 14:04.720
She doesn't.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.722
We can't take two seconds
to discuss this?

14:06.847 --> 14:08.516
I mean, fetuses have been
transplanted before,

14:08.641 --> 14:10.184
whole uteruses, too.

14:10.309 --> 14:12.937
Just terminating the fetus
when it's glued to her intestines

14:13.062 --> 14:16.232
is high-risk surgery,
saving it is a fantasy.

14:16.357 --> 14:18.651
That was at least three seconds.

14:18.776 --> 14:21.278
She's a 37-year old woman
who deserves...

14:21.403 --> 14:22.821
People get what they get,

14:22.947 --> 14:25.115
it has nothing to do
with what they deserve.

14:25.241 --> 14:26.909
And this has nothing to do
with her genitalia

14:27.034 --> 14:29.078
and everything to do
with your genetics.

14:29.203 --> 14:30.538
You told me to get tested.

14:30.663 --> 14:31.664
I didn't know
it was gonna color

14:31.789 --> 14:33.707
your every medical opinion,
every personal opinion.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.125
You didn't think
a death sentence would...

14:35.251 --> 14:39.880
People die.
You, Amber, everyone.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.675
Don't act like you
just figured that out.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.303
I gave you a diagnosis, you don't
like it, there are exits on every floor.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.236

15:05.948 --> 15:07.950
I'm sorry to be
so definitive about this.

15:08.075 --> 15:11.662
I know you're still absorbing the news,
but we have no choice but to...

15:11.787 --> 15:14.248
Remove the fetus, absolutely.

15:15.791 --> 15:18.210
I have no boyfriend,
no husband,

15:18.335 --> 15:21.005
I'm on the road with Patty
all the time.

Where do I sign?

15:24.258 --> 15:25.884
Oh!

15:30.180 --> 15:31.473
Feel any tenderness back here?

15:31.599 --> 15:33.100
No, not at all.

15:34.685 --> 15:37.313
So you're treating
professional sports injuries now?

15:37.438 --> 15:38.397
No, I'm not...

15:38.522 --> 15:40.316
Familiar with the concept of sarcasm.

Don't sweat it, it's new.
Have you spoken to Wilson?

15:43.527 --> 15:45.195
We'll get you an EKG.
I'll be right back.

15:45.321 --> 15:47.364
You want me to sleep with him
to get him to stay?

15:47.489 --> 15:50.993
I put the bisexual chick on that,
but if you'd like to sit in,

15:51.118 --> 15:52.786
- so to speak.
- I spoke to him.

15:52.911 --> 15:53.829
What did you tell him?

15:53.954 --> 15:56.415
I didn't tell him anything.
I listened.

15:56.540 --> 15:58.876
So you could feel good
about doing nothing.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.669
- Tell him...
- I am not your errand girl,

16:00.794 --> 16:02.504

about leaving you.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.715
The two of you
used to be together?

16:04.840 --> 16:07.718
She dumped me when I lost
the last 85 pounds.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.971
Said there was
less of me to love.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.723
Grief means different things
to different people,

16:12.848 --> 16:15.225
case in point,
means very little to you.

16:15.351 --> 16:16.894
Grief is Newark.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.813
Okay, it's there, you can't avoid it,
but the idea is to hold your nose,

16:19.938 --> 16:20.981
hope the traffic's
not too bad

16:21.148 --> 16:24.151
and get on to Manhattan as quickly
as possible, not to buy property.

16:24.276 --> 16:25.986
You think that's
facing up to things?

16:26.111 --> 16:27.029
I'm not the one
who's quitting.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.656

when your husband died?

16:34.787 --> 16:36.705
I got a new job,
and I moved.

- Shut up.

Squeeze her spleen,

17:04.733 --> 17:06.276

so her blood clots.

from committing career malpractice.

Mocking him and insulting him,

17:45.649 --> 17:48.110
technically,
those are categories of conversation.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.154
Block his references to other hospitals,

17:50.279 --> 17:51.947
tell him
he can't hand off his cases until...

17:52.072 --> 17:53.699
Talk to him.

17:53.824 --> 17:56.326
Deal with his grief, talk to him
about what he's going through.

17:56.452 --> 17:59.037
That's a brilliant idea.
I'll take him out for a beer,

17:59.163 --> 18:01.540
that'll make up for the fact
that Amber's in a pine box,

18:01.665 --> 18:04.209
that there's randomness and chaos
in the universe.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.836
Tell him you're sorry.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.421
I didn't kill her.

18:07.546 --> 18:08.839
You were drunk and...

18:08.964 --> 18:12.801
Yeah, if her daddy hadn't been drunk,
she might never have been born. So...

18:12.926 --> 18:14.762
You called her up in
the middle of the night,

18:14.887 --> 18:17.139
she was on the bus
because of you.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.184
I didn't ask her to come out,
I wasn't driving the bus,

18:20.309 --> 18:22.686
I wasn't driving the garbage truck
that hit the bus,

18:22.811 --> 18:25.272
and I did not prescribe her
the flu meds that killed her.

18:25.397 --> 18:28.525
Yes, I know,
that's all true, but...

18:31.153 --> 18:34.490
You really don't feel
any sense of guilt?

18:38.786 --> 18:41.079
You want to keep him,
he needs to know he's not alone.

18:41.205 --> 18:43.499
Just tell him
you feel like crap.

18:44.750 --> 18:45.834
It'd be meaningless.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.549
You don't want
to believe it.

22:20.674 --> 22:23.468
Because if you tell Wilson
how you actually feel about him,

22:23.593 --> 22:25.220
about what
happened to Amber,

22:25.345 --> 22:29.057
about your part in what happened,
and he walks out the door anyway,

22:29.182 --> 22:30.934
if you make yourself
vulnerable for once

22:31.059 --> 22:34.104
in your nerve-deadening,
emotionally-obliterating...

22:35.022 --> 22:38.608
You're doing the same thing he is,
you're running away.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.902
Only he's not killing
anyone in the process.

22:45.866 --> 22:47.743
Where's Dr. House?

22:47.868 --> 22:49.411
He's not feeling well.

22:50.287 --> 22:51.913
Was MS his idea?

22:52.039 --> 22:54.583
We work as a team.
You know how it is,

22:54.708 --> 22:57.502
collaborative, sometimes it's hard
to tell where an idea comes from.

22:57.627 --> 23:02.174
But you're not really a team.
You work for him.

23:04.593 --> 23:06.762
And you work for Patty.

23:06.887 --> 23:09.264
I'm sure a lot of
her ideas are actually...

23:09.389 --> 23:11.600
She would be fine without me.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.352
I'd be nothing without her.

23:14.478 --> 23:18.940
Maybe if you just had the chance.
I'm sure you've learned a lot.

23:19.066 --> 23:21.318
Not everybody's created equal.

23:23.195 --> 23:25.530
Does Dr. House think
I have MS?

23:26.823 --> 23:28.033
Yes.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.204
(SHIVERS)

23:34.831 --> 23:36.333
Did you just shiver?

23:38.752 --> 23:40.712
You're running a slight fever.

23:40.837 --> 23:41.922
Is that bad?

23:42.964 --> 23:45.592
It means we were wrong
about the MS.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.014
You had my cable disconnected.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.599
Well, that's quite a leap.

23:52.724 --> 23:54.935
Just because I happen to have
a 31 -person maintenance department,

23:55.060 --> 23:57.187
each of whom you've personally abused
at some point...

23:57.312 --> 23:58.730
Why?

23:58.855 --> 24:00.440
'Cause you think I'm okay
with letting someone die,

24:00.565 --> 24:02.859
but I'm gonna fold
if I can't watch celebrity bowling?

24:02.984 --> 24:04.861
That is not an unreasonable theory,

24:04.986 --> 24:08.073
especially with only
10 minutes till your favorite soap.

24:08.198 --> 24:11.326
Gee, is this the remote
from the doctors' lounge?

24:16.039 --> 24:18.208
This is your 911? Goodbye.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.459
Stop.

24:20.627 --> 24:23.547
I'm withholding your salary history from
every hospital in the Tri-State Area.

24:23.672 --> 24:25.090
You go, girl.

24:25.215 --> 24:29.261
And I'm permanently setting every TV
in this building to the Pottery Channel

24:29.386 --> 24:31.346
unless you both sit down.

24:33.723 --> 24:36.101
Welcome to couples counseling.

24:37.144 --> 24:38.103
TAUB: It's not the surgery.

24:38.228 --> 24:39.062
Timing fits.

24:39.187 --> 24:41.064
The location doesn't,
unless her brain's in her bowels.

24:41.189 --> 24:42.399
If bacteria entered her bloodstream,

24:42.524 --> 24:44.109
it could have caused
an infection in her brain.

24:44.234 --> 24:46.319
TAUB: The surgery went fine.
You were there, you saw...

24:46.444 --> 24:48.363
Peptostreptococcus
could explain the blinking and...

24:48.488 --> 24:51.616
No. You want to watch a grainy video
and have an epiphany.

24:51.741 --> 24:54.911
Shut up, you're making me
miss House's mocking.

24:56.288 --> 24:58.206
I know you told us
it was none of our business,

24:58.331 --> 25:00.417
but if House thinks that your
Huntington's is affecting you,

25:00.542 --> 25:02.169
- maybe it really...
- It's not, because I don't have...

25:02.294 --> 25:04.004
You're desperate to do this
without him.

25:04.129 --> 25:06.173
You're not trying to cure her,
you're trying to prove...

25:06.298 --> 25:08.091
Stop the tape.

25:08.884 --> 25:10.552
Zoom in.

25:13.889 --> 25:15.557
On the anastomosis,
that little bump.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.393
It's a hematoma,
a harmless pocket of blood,

25:18.518 --> 25:20.645
which is why Chase ignored it
during the surgery.

25:20.770 --> 25:24.149
Could be a ganglioma, which is
why Chase shouldn't have ignored it.

25:24.274 --> 25:26.026
If it's an abnormal growth of nerves,

25:26.151 --> 25:28.403
it could be causing
all the patient's symptoms.

25:29.863 --> 25:32.157
We have to open her up again,
get a piece of it.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.414
So what do you
want to tell us?

25:39.539 --> 25:40.832
Nothing.

25:40.957 --> 25:44.044
Nothing I say is gonna change anything.
You guys need to talk.

25:44.169 --> 25:46.630
Actually, you should read
the latest psych literature,

25:46.755 --> 25:48.548
repression's gaining
a lot of fans.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.133
What you don't face
can't crush you.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.593
Talk to each other.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.261
(SIGHS)

25:53.970 --> 25:55.013
How you doing? Good?

25:55.138 --> 25:56.598
Fine. Thanks.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.476
(EXCLAIMS)
Sit.

26:01.645 --> 26:04.147
See, the two of you are friends,
look how you both...

26:04.272 --> 26:05.690
Think you're an idiot.

26:05.815 --> 26:08.568
We both also eat with forks,
that doesn't really prove...

26:08.693 --> 26:12.155
Talk to him. Tell him how you feel
about what he's doing.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.490
I told him
he's an idiot.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.867
Tell him what you think
about him leaving.

26:15.992 --> 26:16.952
I think he's an idiot.

26:17.077 --> 26:17.953
CUDDY: You're an idiot.

26:18.078 --> 26:21.039
He's in pain, and your response
is just to emotionally blackmail him.

26:21.164 --> 26:22.999
You told me
what your position is on that one.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.209
You're against it, right?

26:24.334 --> 26:27.712
She hasn't told you in front of me.
She needs to prove she's on my side.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.256
Go to hell.

26:29.381 --> 26:30.799
So much for that theory.

26:30.924 --> 26:32.550
I'm sorry you lost Amber.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.678
I cannot imagine what it is
you're going through,

26:34.803 --> 26:36.137
but it will not get better

26:36.263 --> 26:39.266
by you walking away
from everyone that cares about you.

26:40.225 --> 26:42.936
Do you think Amber
would want you to walk away?

26:43.061 --> 26:45.814
Nobody at this hospital
even liked Amber.

26:53.905 --> 26:55.240
Same time next week?

27:00.495 --> 27:04.249
You want me to do a second
major surgery on a patient

27:04.374 --> 27:07.002
we almost lost
during a first major surgery

27:07.127 --> 27:09.671
to see if she needs
a third major surgery?

27:09.796 --> 27:11.172
We need a piece
of the ganglioma.

27:11.298 --> 27:13.508
Then you're talking
about another patient,

27:13.633 --> 27:15.135
yours doesn't
have a ganglioma.

27:15.260 --> 27:17.137
And if there is one
and you missed it?

27:17.262 --> 27:20.223
Then you're talking about
another surgeon, I didn't miss anything.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.100
But we're not talking
about another videotape,

27:22.225 --> 27:24.144
this one showed a bump,
we need to biopsy it.

27:24.269 --> 27:28.523
A bump? Oh, yeah,
my grandfather died of a bump.

27:30.317 --> 27:34.321
She can't survive a second round of
general anesthesia, let alone a third.

27:34.446 --> 27:36.698
You'd do this for House.

27:36.823 --> 27:37.824
Yeah.

27:37.949 --> 27:38.867
Then what do you suggest?

27:38.992 --> 27:41.411
Because the patient's got
a high fever, a low heart rate,

27:41.536 --> 27:44.622
and a dim chance of survival
if we stand here like idiots.

27:44.748 --> 27:47.709
Then I suggest
you don't stand there like idiots.

27:50.253 --> 27:54.507
How do you get coal out of a mountain
when it's someone else's mountain?

27:54.632 --> 27:56.634
If we don't have House,
doesn't mean we can't think like House.

27:56.760 --> 27:59.137
But it does mean
we don't have to talk like him.

27:59.262 --> 28:01.598
You don't dig down.
You go in from the side.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.266
We insert a lighted scope
through the rectum,

28:03.391 --> 28:05.310
move the intestine
till we find the ganglioma,

28:05.435 --> 28:08.855
then push it to the surface.
Where we see the light, we cut.

28:12.650 --> 28:15.362
We'll make as small
an incision as we can,

28:15.487 --> 28:18.073
but unfortunately
it'll be very painful.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.575
After your surgery experience,
we can't give you anesthesia...

28:20.700 --> 28:21.951
Can I talk to Dr. House?

28:23.411 --> 28:24.537
No.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.082
We can do this,
we know what we're doing.

28:27.207 --> 28:28.500
I don't mean
to be insulting,

28:28.625 --> 28:32.295
but my former boss didn't insist on me
coming here because of you or...

28:32.420 --> 28:33.713
Your former boss?

28:33.838 --> 28:35.840
I've been replaced.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.678
- I'm sorry. I mean, you must be...
- I'm fine.

28:41.221 --> 28:42.806
She has a big Beijing trip,

28:42.931 --> 28:46.101
ton of work to do, she can't just wait
for me to get better.

28:48.561 --> 28:51.398
We've been well trained,
we'll take good care of you.

28:57.946 --> 29:00.698
How can you let her
treat you like a footstool?

29:01.658 --> 29:03.159
The world needs flunkies.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.578
Don't say that,
you're better than that.

29:05.703 --> 29:07.789
I have no problem with it.
Why do you?

29:08.832 --> 29:11.418
Because life is short.

29:11.543 --> 29:13.711
I mean,
yours could've ended in that surgery.

29:13.837 --> 29:17.882
You'd have never lived for yourself.
What kind of feminist...

29:18.007 --> 29:20.301
- We can have anything.
- No, we can't.

29:22.137 --> 29:27.684
We can aspire to anything. But we
don't get it just because we want it.

29:28.893 --> 29:31.521
I would rather spend my life
close to the birds

29:31.646 --> 29:34.357
than waste it
wishing I had wings.

29:44.826 --> 29:47.328
FOREMAN: You're through the sigmoid,
into the descending colon.

29:47.454 --> 29:48.913
Switching on the light.

29:49.038 --> 29:51.249
Advance toward
the anastomosis.

29:53.251 --> 29:55.128
That's it.

29:55.253 --> 29:57.839
Push the wall of the intestine
toward the skin.

30:02.719 --> 30:04.762
There, I see it.

30:06.139 --> 30:07.849
Don't look down.

30:08.391 --> 30:09.893
Scalpel.

30:25.116 --> 30:26.910
So your last day is Friday?

30:27.535 --> 30:29.412
I'm gonna miss you.

30:30.079 --> 30:31.915
You shouldn't go.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.626
Did House ask you to talk to me?
Or are you trying to save the patient,

30:34.751 --> 30:36.669
- because there'll always be another...
- House asked me.

30:36.794 --> 30:39.464
- And you're doing it?
- I told him to go to hell.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.258
Thanks.

30:42.550 --> 30:43.843
But I think he's right.

30:48.681 --> 30:53.811
You think you're making a rational
choice. You think the worst is over,

30:53.937 --> 30:59.234
and then six months later,
you look back and you realize

30:59.359 --> 31:01.027
you didn't know
what you were doing.

31:01.152 --> 31:03.154
Are you saying the pain
doesn't go away?

31:03.279 --> 31:04.280
It gets easier.

31:04.405 --> 31:07.951
Not in two months.
Not in two years.

31:08.076 --> 31:11.913
But, no, it never
really goes away.

31:12.038 --> 31:16.042
Being here,
in this building...

31:16.167 --> 31:18.461
I was just in the lounge,
I kept staring at Amber's locker.

31:18.586 --> 31:20.755
I saw a guy
wearing a scarf this morning.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.341
The color reminded me of his eyes.

31:23.633 --> 31:26.010
We lived 500 miles from here.

31:27.554 --> 31:28.930
I have to do something.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.348
Then do it.

31:32.600 --> 31:38.731
But don't think it's the right choice,
because there isn't one.

31:41.359 --> 31:44.404
It's not a ganglioma,
the problem wasn't the surgery.

31:44.529 --> 31:46.906
Abnormally deposited proteins.
It's amyloidosis.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.158
It would explain the blinking
and the low heart rate.

31:49.284 --> 31:51.744
The only way to treat amyloidosis
is to treat whatever's causing it.

31:51.869 --> 31:55.540
It's not as if a lot of things
cause amyloid, rheumatoid arthritis.

31:55.665 --> 31:57.000
Familial Mediterranean fever.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.042
Lymphoma.

31:58.167 --> 31:59.419
Well, we can't all be right.

31:59.544 --> 32:02.463
But you can all be wrong.
Patient's joints don't hurt,

32:02.589 --> 32:04.090
abdominal pain went away
when the fetus did,

32:04.215 --> 32:05.592
and no palpable lymph nodes.

32:05.717 --> 32:07.260
Got anything
constructive to say?

32:07.385 --> 32:08.636
Sorry. Sorry.

32:09.679 --> 32:11.514
She has lots and lots
of palpable lymph nodes,

32:11.639 --> 32:14.100
joint and abdominal pain,
she'll be better by dinner time.

32:14.225 --> 32:16.144
If we don't find
the cause of the amyloidosis,

32:16.269 --> 32:19.689
we never get her off that wire,
she never walks out of this hospital.

32:21.149 --> 32:25.570
But, hey, who needs House?
So glad we lost those training wheels.

32:30.033 --> 32:32.368
You want me to
make the call?

32:32.493 --> 32:34.412
There seems to be
some disagreement.

32:34.537 --> 32:37.665
And this isn't just a pretext
to pressure me into staying?

32:37.790 --> 32:40.084
Does it look
like a pretext?

32:40.209 --> 32:41.336
No.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.838
She really is dying,
isn't she?

32:46.049 --> 32:51.346
Inflammation, enlarged nuclei, some
mitotic activity. It could be lymphoma.

32:51.471 --> 32:52.847
There are no palpable
lymph nodes.

32:52.972 --> 32:55.600
Makes it less likely,
but doesn't rule it out.

32:56.976 --> 32:59.187
I'm an oncologist,
I see cancer.

32:59.312 --> 33:01.439
Show it to an immunologist,
they'll see autoimmune.

33:01.564 --> 33:04.567
I already showed it
to an immunologist.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.444
We'll start her on chemo.

33:08.738 --> 33:10.281
You should leave.

33:10.782 --> 33:12.950
House doesn't want
to lose his sidekick.

33:13.076 --> 33:15.286
Cuddy doesn't want
to lose her check on House.

33:15.411 --> 33:18.039
No one's talking
about what you want.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.791
It's not that I want to.

33:19.916 --> 33:21.793
Want to, need to.

33:22.752 --> 33:24.587
If there's any chance
that being away from here

33:24.712 --> 33:28.591
will make your life
even a little bit easier, do it.

33:29.550 --> 33:31.678
That's what everyone else here would do.

33:50.988 --> 33:53.199
Don't expect anything
to change too fast.

33:53.324 --> 33:54.826
Lymphoma was your idea?

33:56.244 --> 33:57.161
Why?

33:57.286 --> 33:58.663
I feel better.

33:59.539 --> 34:01.749
Sometimes just knowing
you're being treated helps.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.459
You've given me 18 different treatments,

34:03.584 --> 34:06.504
this is the first one
that made me feel better.

34:06.629 --> 34:08.715
I don't think
it's psychological.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.300
Thank you.

34:13.428 --> 34:14.721
I'm sorry.

34:16.013 --> 34:17.724
I shouldn't have
gotten angry at you.

34:17.849 --> 34:19.976
Your choices
are your choices.

34:21.352 --> 34:22.645
You're not like me.

34:25.189 --> 34:27.233
Maybe you have wings.

34:35.324 --> 34:37.285
I have Huntington's Chorea.

34:39.537 --> 34:44.584
Dozen years or so,
my nervous system, my cognitive skills,

34:44.709 --> 34:48.254
even my emotional balance,
they'll all start to fray.

34:49.589 --> 34:54.010
I won't be able to fly,
I won't be able to walk,

34:54.927 --> 34:57.054
I won't be able to breathe.

34:59.515 --> 35:02.226
And you want to make sure
your life matters?

35:03.978 --> 35:09.984
I don't want to just be tightening bolts
and following instructions.

35:10.109 --> 35:16.491
I want something to be different
because of me.

35:17.617 --> 35:18.910
I am.

35:21.662 --> 35:23.664
Not just 'cause
you saved my life.

35:26.167 --> 35:31.422
I'm applying for a job at a foundation.
Running the finance division.

35:32.924 --> 35:34.467
I mean, I don't know if
I'm gonna get it,

35:34.592 --> 35:39.263
but if I don't,
there are other foundations.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.266
(SIGHS)

35:46.229 --> 35:49.106
It's almost 4:00.
Soap time.

35:49.232 --> 35:50.066
(GASPS)

35:51.859 --> 35:54.695
Nurses' remote,
works in the doctors' lounge.

35:54.821 --> 35:56.906
Why do you think
Wilson's leaving?

35:59.992 --> 36:02.662
How many times
do I have to use the word "idiot"?

36:02.787 --> 36:04.413
And that's
a good enough answer for you?

36:04.539 --> 36:06.249
Whenever anyone does
anything out of the norm,

36:06.374 --> 36:10.169
you have to tell them what screwed-up
process is really at work in their head.

36:10.294 --> 36:12.338
That's why I locked
the two of you in a room,

36:12.463 --> 36:14.966
so you would say
something stupid and insensitive

36:15.091 --> 36:17.176
and maybe
with a little bit of truth.

36:17.885 --> 36:19.720
But you didn't.

36:20.137 --> 36:23.808
So I can only assume
that you don't want to know the reason.

36:23.933 --> 36:25.810
You're afraid to know.

36:28.729 --> 36:30.773
You're not listening to me,
are you?

36:31.607 --> 36:34.402
Try it sometime,
you'll see why.

36:43.536 --> 36:44.662
You look 37.

36:44.787 --> 36:46.289
I am 37.

36:47.456 --> 36:49.750
You looked 27 last week.

36:50.084 --> 36:52.336
Unless I blacked out for 10 years,
your skin...

36:52.461 --> 36:54.672
She has got lymphoma,
chemo's probably...

36:54.797 --> 36:56.716
- Stop the chemo.
- She's getting better.

36:56.841 --> 36:58.009
Bradycardia's improving,
we didn't...

36:58.134 --> 36:59.343
She have bruising?

36:59.468 --> 37:02.305
She was pounding her legs
during the hallucinations.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.390
It's not lymphoma.

37:05.266 --> 37:07.101
Hey, don't...
No, no, no.

37:07.226 --> 37:10.396
(GROANING)

37:10.521 --> 37:13.524
My bad.
Thought "no" meant "yes".

37:15.151 --> 37:18.446
Those aren't bruises,
they're mycobacterial lesions.

37:18.571 --> 37:21.449
She has diffuse lepromatous leprosy,

37:21.574 --> 37:24.952
must've caught it on
one of her overseas estrogen tours.

37:25.077 --> 37:28.331
Chemo wipes out some of the bacteria,
she feels a little better,

37:28.456 --> 37:31.208
wipes out most of her immune system,
she gets a whole lot worse.

37:31.334 --> 37:34.795
Leprosy?
Like where my limbs fall off?

37:34.921 --> 37:38.466
Actually, this is the flattering one.
It's also known as "pretty leprosy".

37:38.591 --> 37:41.886
Doesn't disfigure,
makes your skin look younger, smoother.

37:42.011 --> 37:45.056
Don't let the girls hear,
they'll all want to lick your face.

37:45.181 --> 37:48.059
Unless you're that kind of feminist.

37:48.851 --> 37:52.855
Blast her with antibiotics
and prednisone, she'll be fine.

37:52.980 --> 37:55.733
Damn, it's after 4:00.
I'm late.

37:58.194 --> 37:59.695
- Damn.
- What?

38:00.613 --> 38:02.323
She's happy
you're gonna be fine,

38:02.448 --> 38:06.160
but she'd be happier if you were
gonna be fine five minutes ago.

38:13.542 --> 38:16.128
Test confirmed
Dr. House's diagnosis.

38:17.129 --> 38:18.923
Thank God.

38:20.216 --> 38:22.301
When you got pregnant,

38:22.426 --> 38:25.513
the physical stress
triggered e-nodosum leprosum,

38:25.638 --> 38:28.057
a common complication of leprosy.

38:28.182 --> 38:31.811
Inflamed the nerves to your heart,
made it hard to absorb vitamins,

38:31.936 --> 38:35.398
scarred your fallopian tubes.
It explains everything.

38:37.316 --> 38:40.361
Better prescribe me
some skin cream, too, huh?

38:40.486 --> 38:43.030
You might want it
for those job interviews.

38:44.240 --> 38:48.035
I'm going back on the road with Patty.
My replacement flamed out.

38:50.204 --> 38:54.709
She says I can manage some projects
on my own, carve out more of a role.

38:54.834 --> 38:57.670
Do you really think she can change?

38:57.795 --> 38:59.588
I don't know.

39:01.382 --> 39:03.968
The truth is I'm not sure I...

39:04.093 --> 39:05.219
You can change.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.013
No.

39:08.264 --> 39:10.850
I'm not sure
I want her to change.

39:12.685 --> 39:15.396
If she's reasonable,
if she's just another employer,

39:15.521 --> 39:20.151
then I'm just another employee.

39:23.487 --> 39:25.740
In a weird way, I matter.

39:30.828 --> 39:34.623
I like you better now
that you're dying.

39:35.166 --> 39:36.625
I was wrong.

39:36.751 --> 39:40.421
You took a shot.

39:40.546 --> 39:44.759
She's going back to work for that idiot.
It's pathetic.

39:45.676 --> 39:47.511
You thought something would change?

39:47.636 --> 39:52.850
She almost died because of that job.
Yeah, I thought...

39:53.768 --> 39:55.936
Almost dying changes nothing.

40:00.775 --> 40:02.902
Dying changes everything.

40:30.304 --> 40:34.683
I'm sorry.
I know I didn't try to kill her,

40:34.809 --> 40:39.980
I know I didn't want her hurt,
I know it was a freak accident,

40:41.982 --> 40:45.444
but I feel like crap,
and she's dead because of me.

40:47.363 --> 40:49.073
I don't blame you.

40:50.950 --> 40:53.160
I wanted to. I tried to.

40:53.285 --> 40:56.956
I must've reviewed Amber's case file
a hundred times to find a way...

40:58.916 --> 41:00.626
But it wasn't your fault.

41:04.296 --> 41:05.840
Then we're okay?

41:07.007 --> 41:12.888
I mean, I know you're not,
but maybe I can help.

41:13.013 --> 41:14.598
We're not okay.

41:16.267 --> 41:18.602
Amber was never the reason
I was leaving.

41:19.687 --> 41:21.355
I didn't want
to tell you because...

41:21.480 --> 41:22.690
(CHUCKLES)

41:24.733 --> 41:30.030
Because I was trying,
like I always do, to protect you,

41:31.866 --> 41:33.117
which is the problem.

41:34.952 --> 41:38.998
You spread misery
because you can't feel anything else.

41:39.123 --> 41:43.002
You manipulate people because you can't
handle any kind of real relationship.

41:43.127 --> 41:48.424
And I've enabled it for years,
the games, the binges,

41:48.549 --> 41:51.093
the middle-of-the-night phone calls.

41:53.429 --> 41:55.890
I should have been the one
on the bus, not...

41:59.435 --> 42:01.937
You should have been alone on the bus.

42:03.314 --> 42:07.067
If I've learned anything from Amber,
it's that I have to take care of myself.

42:12.448 --> 42:14.325
We're not friends anymore,
House.

42:17.620 --> 42:19.914
I'm not sure we ever were.
