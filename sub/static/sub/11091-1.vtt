00:50.175 --> 00:52.301
Welcome to Sheffield!

00:52.428 --> 00:56.013
The beating heart
of Britain's industrial North!

00:56.140 --> 00:59.809
The jewel in Yorkshire's crown
is home to over half a million people,

00:59.935 --> 01:04.855
and thousands more
flock here daily to shop and to work.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.775
All this is built on
Sheffield's primary industry,

01:07.860 --> 01:09.944
steel.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.405
The city's rolling mills, forges,

01:12.489 --> 01:15.408
and workshops employ some 90,000 men

01:15.492 --> 01:19.746
and state-of-the-art machinery
to make the world's finest steel.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.539
From high-tensile girders

01:21.665 --> 01:26.085
to the stainless cutlery
for your dining table.

01:26.170 --> 01:29.172
But it's not all hard work
for the people of Steel City.

01:29.298 --> 01:32.091
They can spend the day
lounging by the pool,

01:32.176 --> 01:34.886
watching one of our top soccer teams,

01:35.012 --> 01:38.014
or browsing in the shops.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.771
But when the sun goes down,
the fun really starts

01:44.855 --> 01:47.690
in the city's numerous
nightclubs and discotheques.

01:47.816 --> 01:51.819
Yes, Yorkshire folk know
how to have a good time!

01:51.904 --> 01:54.572
And it's good times
for the city's housing, too!

01:54.698 --> 01:56.991
Sheffield leads the way in town planning.

01:57.075 --> 02:01.871
Victorian slums have been cleared
to make way for the homes of the future.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.292
Thanks to steel,

02:06.376 --> 02:08.211
Sheffield really is

02:08.336 --> 02:10.880
a city on the move!

02:30.734 --> 02:33.986
Gaz, who's gonna buy a rusty girder?

02:34.071 --> 02:36.364
- Come on.
- Dad, it's stealing!

02:36.448 --> 02:39.075
No, it's liberating, love. Liberating.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.285
Gaz, hang on.

02:42.871 --> 02:46.666
Ten years we worked in here. Now look.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.794
- What if we get caught?
- You don't get a record till you're 16.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.088
- Just don't tell your mum.
- Hey, listen.

02:53.465 --> 02:54.924
Music.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.098
Bloody hell!

03:07.896 --> 03:11.732
- What are they doing?
- lt's the works band. lt's still going.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.819
About only thing round here that is.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.781
'Ey up! Security guard's back.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.917
"Won't take a minute," he says.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.086
"Won't take a minute." Now what?

03:32.170 --> 03:34.297
Shut up. l'm thinking.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.467
Can't we do normal things sometimes?

03:38.594 --> 03:40.595
This is normal! lsn't it, Dave?

03:40.679 --> 03:42.722
Oh, aye. Everyday stuff, this.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.849
l think this bugger's sinking.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.812
Pick it up,
and try and slide it across other side.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.147
That's it.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.233
Oh, fucking hell, Nathe!

03:54.318 --> 03:59.071
They're 20 quid each, them!
That were your bloody maintenance!

03:59.156 --> 04:01.240
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, nice one.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.117
Nathe!

04:03.201 --> 04:04.660
Nathan!

04:04.745 --> 04:07.496
- Fucking hell!
- Come 'ere, come 'ere!

04:08.081 --> 04:10.166
Jesus! Stay still.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.335
Stay still, stay still.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.171
All right.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.966
What's your initiative got to say
about this, then, bog eyes?

04:21.762 --> 04:24.555
'Ey up, there's someone coming.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.351
- All right?
- Aye, not so bad.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.021
"Not so bad"?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.565
"Not so bad"?
That's not much of a chuffing SOS!

04:34.650 --> 04:37.693
All right, don't get a benny on.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.948
Shit!

04:47.829 --> 04:49.914
Me jeans are bloody soaking!

04:49.998 --> 04:51.874
You should have taken your kit off.

04:51.959 --> 04:57.004
- What's up? Are you shy?
- Don't! Shut it, all right?

04:57.089 --> 04:58.089
'Ey up, Dave.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.257
- All right, babe?
- Dad!

05:00.342 --> 05:03.928
What do you reckon, Dave?
Eight? Maybe even a nine.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.931
- You can never tell till you see their tits.
- Dad!

05:07.015 --> 05:10.434
- What's all this?
- lt's them Chippendale efforts.

05:10.519 --> 05:11.811
You what?

05:11.895 --> 05:14.188
Them dancers.
Mum were going on about it.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.733
Oh, you're joking!
She must be getting desperate.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.112
- You all waiting for me, then?
- Yeah! To go home.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.031
You know where to find me
when you tire of them poofs.

05:24.116 --> 05:26.701
- Dad!
- Come on, Gaz, l'm freezing.

05:27.411 --> 05:29.495
"Women only"?

05:29.579 --> 05:32.498
Cheeky buggers!
lt's a bloody working-men's club!

05:32.582 --> 05:34.959
l mean, look at the state of that!

05:35.043 --> 05:36.836
What have you got to smile about?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.671
He's got no willy, for starters.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.841
Nowt in a gym'll help you there, mate!

05:41.925 --> 05:44.677
No decent woman would
be seen dead in there.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.554
Jean would.

05:46.638 --> 05:49.724
Oh, Dave, what's going on?

05:49.808 --> 05:51.058
lt's her money, innit?

05:51.143 --> 05:56.689
Fucking hell! You'll let some poof wave his
tackle at your missis? Where's your pride?

05:56.773 --> 06:01.527
She's already got you hoovering! I saw it
and I let it go! But this? No, no, no.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.655
- Get her out of there.
- lt's women only.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.077
Hurry up, will you?
Me feet have gone numb.

06:10.162 --> 06:14.331
That's gratitude for you! We're riding
into Alley of Death for you, you fat git.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.626
lt's not my fault I can't fit through.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.130
Right, then. I'll wait 'ere and keep guard.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.675
Find Auntie Jean and tell her
Uncle Dave wants a word outside.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.178
- Do I have to?
- Good kid. On you go.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.408
Off! Off! Off!

07:00.545 --> 07:02.546
l'm not waiting in that bloody queue.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.132
l always wanted a nosy
in the men's toilets.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.301
Phwoar! Them bloody muscles!

07:07.385 --> 07:10.387
lt's not their bodies, Bee.
lt's what they do with 'em.

07:10.472 --> 07:14.517
l don't know what you're worrying about,
with you-know-who on your tail.

07:14.601 --> 07:18.646
Frankie! Do you want my body?

07:18.730 --> 07:24.360
Frank don't fancy me and I don't
fancy Frank, right? So give over!

07:25.445 --> 07:28.030
Do you think he might, though?

07:31.076 --> 07:34.537
No. Couldn't do that to Dave.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.289
Not even if I wanted to.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.584
But... you know, it's like he's given up.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.963
Work. Me. Everything.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.965
Ah, love.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.967
'Ere, love. This'll cheer you up.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.603
l weren't in Girl Guides for nowt!

08:16.580 --> 08:17.997
Gaz!

08:18.081 --> 08:20.249
Gaz! That were our Jean, weren't it?

08:20.333 --> 08:23.878
No, no. Just a couple of old tarts.
l'm going back in for Nathe.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.969
You're in big trouble.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.096
What about Auntie Jean?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.351
Auntie Jean's busy.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.695
l don't feel well.

08:49.779 --> 08:53.490
Of course you don't! You've got a
hangover. Take a day off. Stay at home.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.785
Your house is messy. And it's cold.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.246
Come down job club.
That'll be a right laugh.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.873
Mum's house is always warm.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.542
l can't always
have the red carpet out for you.

09:03.627 --> 09:08.130
Anyway, it's not your mum's house.
lt's whatshisname... Barry's.

09:08.215 --> 09:12.051
Tell you what. Next weekend
l'll have a big tidy round. I promise!

09:12.135 --> 09:13.677
Even go and see a footie game.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.347
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Sunday League down the park.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.390
There's some right good players.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.976
United are playing Man U, aren't they?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.145
You know I can't stretch to that.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.523
You're always making me do
stupid stuff like last night.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.692
Other dads don't do that.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.445
Don't they?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.656
- Aye.
- Aye.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.619
Nathe!

09:38.703 --> 09:41.372
We could try and sneak into Man U.
Terry said...

09:41.498 --> 09:42.539
No!

09:42.666 --> 09:45.417
All right! l'll... I'll get tickets! I will!

09:45.502 --> 09:48.879
Ooh! Aah! Cantona!
Has to wear a girlie bra!

09:51.258 --> 09:53.342
We'll stuff 'em, Nathe.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.055
Fuck!

10:02.519 --> 10:07.231
l want the application letters finished
by the time I get back.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.733
Any problems, l'm outside.

10:16.283 --> 10:21.036
l tell you, when women
start pissing like us, that's it.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.289
We're finished, Dave.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.457
Extincto.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.710
Yeah, I mean...

10:27.794 --> 10:30.129
How? You know...

10:30.213 --> 10:32.172
- How?
- Genetic mutations.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.340
They're turning into us.

10:33.425 --> 10:38.429
A few years and men won't exist.
Except in a zoo or summat.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.806
We're not needed no more, are we?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.726
Obsolete. Dinosaurs.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.436
Yesterday's news.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.940
Like skateboards.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.777
Button it!
Some of us are trying to get a job.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.446
And it says no smoking in 'ere.

10:55.572 --> 11:00.868
Aye, and it says job club up there. When
did you last see one of them walk in?

11:00.952 --> 11:04.288
You forget, Gerald,
you're not our foreman now.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.206
You're just like the rest of us.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.460
- Scrap.
- Shut it, right?

11:11.755 --> 11:13.047
Hang on, though.

11:13.131 --> 11:16.675
Why were all them women
int' working-men's club int' first place?

11:16.760 --> 11:19.678
Now then! Cos of us. Men.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.972
You call them Chippendales men?

11:22.098 --> 11:23.640
Degrading, that's what it were.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.477
How many lassies were there, though?

11:26.603 --> 11:28.645
Thousands. Baying for blood.

11:28.772 --> 11:32.608
Ten quid to watch some fucking poof
get his kit off! Ten quid!

11:32.692 --> 11:37.363
Times ten quid by a thousand, right?
And you've got...

11:38.448 --> 11:40.366
Yeah, well, a lot. A very lot.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.036
10,000 quid.

11:45.872 --> 11:49.208
- How much?
- 10,000 quid.

11:52.212 --> 11:56.215
'Ey, now, Dave, I mean...
lt's worth a thought, though, innit?

11:57.884 --> 12:02.096
Little And Large prancing round Sheffield
with their widgers out!

12:02.180 --> 12:03.931
That would be worth ten quid!

12:04.015 --> 12:06.392
Don't be so bloody daft.
We were just saying...

12:06.476 --> 12:11.605
- Widgers on parade! Bring a microscope!
- I don't see why the chuff not!

12:11.689 --> 12:16.568
Because you're fat and he's thin,
and you're both fucking ugly.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.737
Bastard!

12:31.751 --> 12:33.669
What's all this about sole custody?

12:33.753 --> 12:37.047
You know what. lf you want
joint custody, you pay your share.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.426
- 700 quid.
- l'm ont' dole, in case you hadn't noticed!

12:40.510 --> 12:45.013
- Get a job! I'll gi' you a job!
- £2.50 an hour in Black Hole of Calcutta!

12:45.098 --> 12:46.807
No, thank you.

12:46.891 --> 12:51.687
lf you want to play your games, do that,
but Nathan's gonna have two parents now.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.814
And your live-in lover's gonna do that?

12:53.898 --> 12:56.567
Abracadabra, here he is! Evening, Barry.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.236
That'll be for t'court to decide.

12:59.362 --> 13:03.407
No, it won't. Nathan's yours and mine.
He's fuck-all to do with him!

13:03.533 --> 13:08.829
- As if you've ever given a toss.
- Face it. He don't like staying at yours.

13:08.913 --> 13:12.207
Course he bloody does! Ask him!

13:12.292 --> 13:13.459
Ask him!

13:13.543 --> 13:16.044
Oi, Nathe! We have a laugh, don't we?

13:16.129 --> 13:19.173
- Gary! Don't!
- ls he in?

13:19.257 --> 13:21.008
ls he in?

13:21.092 --> 13:22.551
Nathe!

13:24.137 --> 13:27.181
He can't hear you through your...
triple bloody glazing.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.224
He can hear all right.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.644
This... This is all wrong, this is.

13:32.729 --> 13:36.106
lt's all to fucking cock.
l'm his dad, and you...

13:36.232 --> 13:37.608
You're nobody.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.776
Goodnight, Gary.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.333
Night, Nathe!

13:55.335 --> 13:57.419
See you, kid!

14:06.346 --> 14:07.513
No. Not doing it.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.766
- l'm not stripping.
- They're taking him away.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.227
All I need is 700 quid
and they've got nowt on me.

14:13.311 --> 14:16.813
- Gaz, no.
- Dave, he's me kid!

14:16.940 --> 14:18.607
l suppose there's nicking cars.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.693
- No!
- Well, then?

14:21.778 --> 14:24.821
Look, I'll help, all right?
l'm running, aren't l?

14:24.948 --> 14:26.698
But l'm taking nowt off. Final.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.867
Come on, Dave. Don't stop now.

14:28.952 --> 14:32.287
- Keep up, you fat bastard!
- Gazza, you tosser!

14:41.548 --> 14:43.131
Do you need a hand?

14:51.474 --> 14:53.684
Yeah, it's your HT leads, I reckon.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.479
Give it a go at that.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.156
Didn't you work at Harrisons
afore it shut down?

15:08.241 --> 15:11.201
Ah! I thought I clocked you!

15:11.327 --> 15:14.913
l were ont' floor with Gaz.
Him up the road.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.583
How's it going, then?

15:17.667 --> 15:19.334
You got any work?

15:22.005 --> 15:23.672
No, there's not a lot about.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.884
Well, like I say,
get some new ones when you can.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.345
No, no, my chuffing pleasure!

15:41.441 --> 15:43.525
Dave?

15:53.870 --> 15:56.955
- Are you all right, kid?
- You bastard!

16:02.253 --> 16:04.254
'Ey! 'Ey!

16:17.894 --> 16:19.895
You could shoot yoursen.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.397
Where's he gonna find
a gun from round 'ere?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.526
You wanna find yourself a big bridge.

16:26.611 --> 16:31.948
Yeah. Like one of them bungee jumps,
only without the bungee bit.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.326
l can't stand heights, me.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.252
Drowning. Now there's a way to go.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.298
l can't swim.

16:48.424 --> 16:52.928
You don't have to fucking swim, you divvy.
That's the point.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.430
You're not very keen, are you?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.766
Sorry.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.309
l know.

16:59.435 --> 17:05.147
Stand in the middle of t'road and get
a mate to drive smack into you right fast.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.528
Haven't got any mates.

17:09.612 --> 17:14.116
We just saved your fucking life,
so don't tell us we're not your mates!

17:15.952 --> 17:18.119
- Yeah?
- Yeah, me an' all.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.123
l'd run you down soon as look at you.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.541
Oh, cheers.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.461
Ta.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.632
Thanks a lot.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.068
- What are you doing, Mum?
- Where have you been?

17:50.153 --> 17:52.070
Driving.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.699
- Driving where?
- Just driving.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.119
l thought you'd gone.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.415
Security guard in 'ere?
No wonder he wants to kill himself.

18:03.499 --> 18:08.336
Well, at least one bloke got a job
out of this place being shut down.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.757
What did you tell him for, anyroad?
The kid's a nutter.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.259
He's a bugle player.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.721
Could come in right handy.
Might need a bit of music.

18:17.847 --> 18:21.183
He's got a car. Somewhere to practice.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.729
Besides, it's good whatsitsname
for the lad... Therapy.

18:25.855 --> 18:29.316
Oh, aye!
Jiggling about in the buff. Therapy!

18:29.400 --> 18:32.235
l tell you, he won't be the only one
trying to top himself

18:32.320 --> 18:34.404
if you carry on wi' this caper.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.990
Dad, l'm hungry.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.201
'Ey up!

18:45.249 --> 18:47.876
'Ey! Lomper!

18:47.960 --> 18:51.880
- Where's me rice?
- Try the cylinder head... tubby.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.550
l don't like Chinese.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.969
'Course you do... Don't you?

18:58.054 --> 19:02.724
- Let's see his records.
- What have we got, Dave?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.893
"The Floral Dance."

19:06.395 --> 19:09.231
- "Marching With Hepworth"?
- Jesus Christ!

19:09.315 --> 19:11.983
Ah, Hot Chocolate! Now we're talking!

19:12.068 --> 19:14.361
l believe in miracles

19:14.445 --> 19:16.154
Since you came along

19:16.239 --> 19:18.156
You sexy thang

19:18.241 --> 19:20.659
Stick it on, Daverimo! l'm there.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.758
Dad! Dad, don't.

19:36.843 --> 19:41.221
lt's all right, Nathan.
lt's right, is this. l've seen 'em do it.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.849
- Good evening, shoppers...
- Dave!

19:43.933 --> 19:46.017
All right, all right.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.855
"You Sexy Thing." One, two...

20:41.991 --> 20:44.534
- I need an audience.
- You need a doctor.

20:49.665 --> 20:53.251
l tell you,
there's summat up wi' that kid.

20:57.173 --> 21:00.091
- Did you check the whole top end?
- Yeah!

21:00.176 --> 21:02.260
There's no point. He went out.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.846
- You what?
- I seen him go.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.058
There's the beggar.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.977
Oi, Nathe!

21:11.062 --> 21:12.979
Nathan!

21:13.064 --> 21:15.523
Nathan.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.653
Hell-fire!

21:19.737 --> 21:23.198
- What are you doing out here, kid?
- Nowt. Walking home.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.368
lt's miles home! You know that!

21:26.452 --> 21:28.954
Why did you run off like that?

21:31.707 --> 21:33.959
You're embarrassed, aren't you?

21:34.043 --> 21:37.212
You think your own dad's a dickhead.

21:38.422 --> 21:41.883
We're not doing this for a laugh,
you know.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.135
l'm trying to get some brass together

21:44.220 --> 21:48.056
so as you and me can keep
seeing each other.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.351
They're trying to stop us, you see.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.228
Oh, well, I may as well not bother.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.397
Except l'm your dad.

21:58.067 --> 22:01.069
lt counts for something, don't it?

22:04.991 --> 22:07.075
l like you.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.246
l love you, you bugger.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.583
All right, kid?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.759
- All right?
- Yeah.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.014
You nutter.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.652
- Well, you said dancing.
- lt were a great idea, kid.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.822
Just not the right sort of dancing.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.575
Gaz! 'Ey, look 'ere.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.828
Oh, my God!

22:51.954 --> 22:54.539
Gerald, me lad, you're gonna be
famous down job club.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.374
He's not bad for a bastard, is he?

22:56.459 --> 22:59.335
He's dead, that's what he is.

23:05.676 --> 23:08.178
You said you wanted a dance teacher.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.055
Gerald? Go get chuffed!

23:10.139 --> 23:14.434
He'd tell every bugger!
We'd be laughed out of Sheffield.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.728
'Ey up, lads. Bandits at six o'clock.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.858
Ah, come in, Torvill.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.902
Park your sequins over 'ere.

23:23.986 --> 23:27.489
- You've had your laugh. Now piss off.
- lt's a free country.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.909
- You were rather good. Nifty footwork.
- Gerald!

23:31.827 --> 23:33.036
Oh, hello.

23:33.162 --> 23:39.626
- Gerald, you're missing the rumba.
- Sorry, I just met some pals from... work.

23:39.710 --> 23:43.671
- Not thinking ofjoining our class?
- Funny you should mention it...

23:43.756 --> 23:47.842
- I think we'd better be getting back now.
- Well, goodnight.

23:47.927 --> 23:52.639
You get back to your rumba.
See you later, Gerald.

23:52.723 --> 23:55.100
At work.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.622
He's got gnomes.

24:17.706 --> 24:20.959
Aye, he bloody would have.

24:23.587 --> 24:25.421
Things looking up?

24:25.548 --> 24:27.340
You know, love, I think they just might be.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.716
Good.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.677
You've been working too hard.

24:30.761 --> 24:34.764
You should let a colleague
do the lion's share for a change.

24:34.890 --> 24:38.560
- I wish you'd be firmer, Gerald.
- Oh, well. Mustn't be late.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.771
- So it's all right if l...
- Oh, Linda, love...

24:41.897 --> 24:45.400
Oh, don't be so mean!
Things are looking up. You said so.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.569
You'll love skiing.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.282
Linda...

24:55.828 --> 24:57.912
lt don't matter. Bye.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.087
'Ey, Gaz.

25:13.262 --> 25:16.014
- Off to the office, Torvill?
- Yes, I bloody am!

25:16.098 --> 25:18.183
Put that back. Put it back!

25:19.268 --> 25:23.396
See that? lnterview.
ln the bloody bag. Mate from Harrisons.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.857
l could do the job standing on me head.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.151
l won't have
to look at your ugly mugs again.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.862
- Come on, we just need some help.
- Sorry.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.323
There's nothing I can do to help you.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.575
Just wanna know about dancing.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.661
Dancers have coordination, skill,

25:38.829 --> 25:41.706
timing, fitness and grace.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.500
Take a long hard look in the mirror.

25:44.627 --> 25:47.337
Now, l'm busy.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.839
Don't be late for job club, lads.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.301
Bastard!

25:56.847 --> 25:59.641
Starting at £16,000,
plus the pension scheme.

25:59.725 --> 26:04.562
lt'll be a relief to get back to work.
lt's not been an easy six months.

26:04.647 --> 26:07.732
l'm up to date with
the latest industry developments,

26:07.816 --> 26:10.526
and l've kept meself...

26:13.697 --> 26:16.199
busy, you know.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.869
Well, all the qualifications
are there, obviously.

26:19.995 --> 26:23.331
And we go back further
than I care to remember.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.542
Sorry?

26:32.424 --> 26:35.093
What we're asking, Gerald, is...

26:35.177 --> 26:40.265
after such a long lay-off,
do you think you're up to the job?

26:45.562 --> 26:46.604
You... !

26:46.689 --> 26:48.690
- Bastard!
- Fucking hell!

26:52.528 --> 26:54.570
'Ey, Gerry, mate...

26:55.364 --> 26:58.783
- You didn't get it, then?
- Get out the way! Come 'ere!

26:58.867 --> 27:01.869
Bastard! That were mine, that job!

27:03.038 --> 27:04.789
You don't give a toss! You're kids!

27:04.873 --> 27:08.668
lt's different for me! l've got
a standard of living! Responsibilities!

27:08.752 --> 27:11.713
l were on me way up! I am on me way up!

27:14.258 --> 27:17.468
lt were me first interview in months!

27:17.553 --> 27:21.889
l could've got me first month's in advance.
She'd never have known.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.391
Now what?

27:23.475 --> 27:26.060
She's still got credit cards, you know.

27:26.145 --> 27:32.775
She's out there now, ont' High Street,
with a fucking MasterCard, spending!

27:32.901 --> 27:34.944
Why can't you just tell her?

27:35.070 --> 27:39.240
How can I tell her after six months?

27:39.325 --> 27:43.411
A woman who wants to go skiing
for us holidays!

27:47.166 --> 27:49.417
Skiing, for fuck's sake!

27:52.254 --> 27:55.173
Why did you do it? lt was my job!

27:55.257 --> 27:58.843
lt had to be my... job!

28:39.051 --> 28:42.011
Can't you just leave me alone?

28:54.566 --> 28:56.692
We stuck it with superglue.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.903
You can't hardly see t'join.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.245
- Go on.
- Oh, yeah.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.208
We got this int' jumble, like, to say sorry.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.838
Wheels go round and everything.

29:18.424 --> 29:23.010
lt's for your gnomes, really. Not you.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.304
l...

29:25.389 --> 29:28.015
l don't know...

29:29.935 --> 29:32.186
lt's marvelous, this.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.776
We were thinking...

29:38.861 --> 29:41.654
you can maybe put it next to...
wishing well.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.865
Make a bit of a...

29:44.533 --> 29:47.034
- Feature.
- Yeah.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.203
What do you reck?

29:53.750 --> 29:55.877
Ta, lads.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.547
Ta very much.

30:02.426 --> 30:05.261
Cigarette me, for fuck's sake.

30:07.598 --> 30:10.516
Think any of them could dance?

30:10.601 --> 30:14.437
You're not still on about
this Chippendales malarkey, are you?

30:14.563 --> 30:17.899
A Yorkshire version.
Them buggers can, we bloody can.

30:17.983 --> 30:20.985
- You can't dance.
- We know, Gerald.

30:21.069 --> 30:25.573
- Gaz, niner on its way.
- Why do you think we're trailing you?

30:25.657 --> 30:28.618
lt's not my kind of dancing.
lt's all arse wiggling.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.578
l've got a degree in arse wiggling, mate.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.956
You learn us dancing,
l'll learn you the rest.

30:34.082 --> 30:37.627
Gerald, for once, l'm dead serious.
l need your help.

30:37.753 --> 30:41.672
What if someone spots me? What if
Linda finds out? l've got standing, me.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.299
You've an overdraft an' all.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.067
l'm sorry. Sorry.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.529
l thought l'd give it a go.

31:46.655 --> 31:49.699
l got a bit desperate. You know how it is.

31:49.825 --> 31:53.077
l can't even take my kit off properly, can l?

31:53.161 --> 31:56.247
You're all right, Reg.
There's some tea if you like.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.374
No, thanks. The kids are outside.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.293
Bring 'em in.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.044
No.

32:02.713 --> 32:04.839
This is no place for kids.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.225
This is crazy.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.938
So,

32:21.023 --> 32:22.857
it's Mr. Horse.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.568
Horse.

32:25.694 --> 32:26.902
Yeah, well...

32:27.029 --> 32:30.031
Just a minute, Mr. Horse.
My colleagues on the panel...

32:30.115 --> 32:32.908
Ask him why he's called the Horse.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.830
You bloody ask him!
lt's not cos he does the Grand National.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.166
That's all very well,
but a big wanger is no use

32:40.250 --> 32:42.835
if you need a zimmer frame to tout it in.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.962
l mean, he must be 50 if he's a day.

32:45.047 --> 32:48.382
So, Horse, what can you do?

32:49.718 --> 32:51.844
Dunno, really.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.847
Let's see, there's the...

32:54.931 --> 32:56.474
There's the bump.

32:56.558 --> 33:00.061
The stomp. The bus stop.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.438
Me breakdancing days are probably over.

33:02.564 --> 33:05.399
- But I do the funky chicken.
- Now you're talking!

33:05.484 --> 33:08.444
- All of 'em?
- Well, yeah. I think so.

33:08.570 --> 33:12.156
Well, it's been a while, mind.
And l've got this dodgy hip.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.866
Yeah.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.827
Well, stick it on, Nathe.
Do your worst, pal.

34:00.956 --> 34:05.042
My favorite film's "Singing lnt' Rain".
That walking-up-wall thing is ace!

34:05.127 --> 34:08.129
He knows me.
He plastered our bathroom a while back.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.089
- Get rid of him.
- You'll be fine.

34:10.172 --> 34:12.591
- He'll blow my cover.
- Shut up!

34:12.676 --> 34:15.678
- What walking-up-wall thing?
- I'll show you.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.888
l'm Donald O'Connor, right?

34:21.560 --> 34:22.976
That's the wall.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.991
Oh, well...

34:37.242 --> 34:39.702
lt's better than that in the film, you know.

34:41.705 --> 34:44.373
So... you don't sing?

34:44.498 --> 34:46.208
No.

34:46.333 --> 34:49.920
- You don't dance?
- No.

34:50.005 --> 34:54.675
Hope you don't think l'm being nosy,
but... what do you do?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.844
Well...

34:56.928 --> 34:59.013
There is... this.

35:08.857 --> 35:12.401
Gentlemen, the lunchbox... has landed.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.159
Chuffing Nora!

35:20.243 --> 35:22.703
All right, Gerald? I didn't see you!

35:23.747 --> 35:25.206
l did his bathroom.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.251
Hello, Guy.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.086
Nathe...

35:31.213 --> 35:33.422
Nathan!

35:37.761 --> 35:40.221
- I say, Jean!
- Yeah?

35:40.305 --> 35:42.389
Ever been out with a black bloke?

35:42.474 --> 35:46.143
- You know I haven't, Dave.
- But...

35:46.228 --> 35:48.729
lf you
were ont' lookout for a new fella, right?

35:48.814 --> 35:51.106
lf you were, just saying,

35:51.233 --> 35:53.275
would you think about it?

35:53.401 --> 35:55.444
What's got into you?

35:56.780 --> 35:58.906
No, would you, though?

35:59.908 --> 36:01.784
l might do. Yeah.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.245
ls that all right?

36:04.329 --> 36:06.789
- So it's true.
- l've bloody had enough of this.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.749
What's true?

36:08.834 --> 36:11.335
What they say about black blokes.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.462
They've got great bodies and that.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.631
Some of 'em. Yeah.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.844
And?

36:20.595 --> 36:22.513
Nothing.

36:23.598 --> 36:27.977
David... I don't care if they're black,
white, or bloody rainbow-colored.

36:28.103 --> 36:31.313
l'm married to you. Remember?

36:31.439 --> 36:33.482
Yeah.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.280
Night.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.035
Why would I want anyone else?

36:45.996 --> 36:48.122
Big man.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.546
Jeanie,

36:55.630 --> 36:57.715
l'm all in.

36:59.968 --> 37:04.346
lt's amazing how tiring it is doing nowt,
you know.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.962
They're just messing, Dave.

37:37.047 --> 37:39.173
- Do you reckon?
- 'Course!

37:39.257 --> 37:41.342
Just Jean, innit?

37:43.762 --> 37:46.931
- Got any of them mint chocolate jobs?
- You're on a diet.

37:47.015 --> 37:51.268
- Don't you start an' all.
- How much you got, then?

37:53.104 --> 37:56.106
22... 27 pence.

37:56.191 --> 37:59.902
£4.99, special offer.
We're still a fucking fiver short.

38:00.028 --> 38:02.947
You know what this means, Dave?

38:03.031 --> 38:05.115
Oh, no! Come on, Gaz. Why me?

38:05.200 --> 38:08.827
You've got an innocent face.
l've got serial killer written on mine.

38:08.912 --> 38:11.830
lf you won't dance,
you can do something useful.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.291
Jean'll throw an eppy!
She's only over there!

38:14.376 --> 38:18.545
She's miles away!
See you later. Good luck.

38:18.630 --> 38:22.800
- Give us a pear drop, you.
- They're not paid for.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.355
Hey, what's this?

39:18.440 --> 39:21.859
l didn't go on the nick in Asda
for some chuffing women's DlY video.

39:21.943 --> 39:24.445
lt's Flashdance, Dave. She's a welder.

39:24.529 --> 39:27.489
l hope she dances better than she welds!

39:27.615 --> 39:30.576
- Look at that! Her mix is all to cock.
- Shut up, Dave.

39:30.660 --> 39:34.288
- What do you know about welding?
- More than some chuffing woman!

39:34.372 --> 39:36.957
lt's like Bonfire Night.
Too much acetylene.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.084
Them joints won't hold fuck all.

39:39.169 --> 39:42.379
For Christ's sake,
we're looking for dancing.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.339
He's got the hump about Asda.

39:44.466 --> 39:47.134
'Ey, cop a load of that.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.682
What did I tell you?
She's nifty on her pins.

39:57.145 --> 40:00.230
That, gentlemen,
is what we are looking for.

40:00.315 --> 40:04.485
Oh, aye. I can just see him doing
all that twizzling-about bollocks.

40:04.569 --> 40:09.031
lt's souped-up tango, is that. Teach
any bugger in a week. Even you, mate.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.408
Even a fat bastard like me?

40:11.493 --> 40:14.328
Yeah, I know what I am,
so don't take the piss.

40:15.705 --> 40:18.749
All right. Two weeks.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.668
Straight up.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.804
l dunno, Gaz. Jean reckons...

40:31.888 --> 40:34.598
l should take that security-guard job
at Asda.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.017
Jesus! Security?

40:37.102 --> 40:38.727
You're worth more than that.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.896
She don't think so.

40:41.022 --> 40:44.149
l reckon summat's going on
with her and that bloke.

40:44.234 --> 40:45.859
The juggling bugger?

40:45.944 --> 40:48.070
No. No way.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.239
lt's not as if l'd blame her.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.407
You could show her, Dave.

40:52.534 --> 40:56.912
Nobody tells them Chippendales
to do security. Raking it in, they are!

40:57.038 --> 41:01.750
Two weeks. That's what the man said,
and he's not taking the piss.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.710
Aye, it's a thought.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.754
lt's more than a thought.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.883
Think of Jean's face when
she sees you dancing like Flashdance.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.679
Two weeks? Just like flashy tits?

41:13.763 --> 41:15.889
lt's what your man said.

41:16.891 --> 41:20.894
'Ey... I can weld better than her an' all.

41:23.231 --> 41:25.274
Stop! No, no! Stop! Stop!

41:25.400 --> 41:29.153
- What?
- You stay still!

41:29.237 --> 41:32.239
And you... go forward, OK?

41:32.323 --> 41:34.241
- OK.
- All right, Nathan.

41:39.080 --> 41:43.083
No, no, no! Jesus Christ!

41:43.168 --> 41:47.462
All I want to do
is get you in a straight bloody line!

41:47.589 --> 41:49.506
What do I have to do?

41:49.591 --> 41:51.800
lt's the Arsenal offside trap, isn't it?

41:51.926 --> 41:55.179
- You what?
- The Arsenal offside trap.

41:55.263 --> 41:57.389
Lomper here is Tony Adams, right?

41:57.473 --> 41:59.391
Any bugger looks like scoring,

41:59.475 --> 42:04.062
we all step forward in a line
and wave our arms around like a fairy.

42:04.147 --> 42:05.772
That's easy.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.358
OK!

42:08.443 --> 42:10.527
Nathan!

42:15.783 --> 42:17.868
Ref!

42:18.328 --> 42:21.788
Perfect.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.457
Well, you should have said.

42:28.296 --> 42:30.631
Come on. Get in quick,
and wipe your boots.

42:33.843 --> 42:37.721
- Put that back. You'll break it.
- l'm just looking.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.681
Bit posh, innit?

42:39.807 --> 42:40.933
Right, then.

42:41.017 --> 42:44.645
- Are we right?
- Right for what?

42:44.729 --> 42:47.773
Taking us kit off.

42:47.857 --> 42:50.108
l thought you were turning me
into a fancy dancer.

42:50.193 --> 42:52.319
Ladies, we are strippers, aren't we?

42:52.403 --> 42:54.488
What, here? Now? ln this house?

42:56.658 --> 43:00.702
- This is a good area, this is.
- Gaz... I dunno.

43:00.828 --> 43:02.913
lf we can't get us kit off
in front of ourselves,

43:02.997 --> 43:05.874
what chance have we got
in front of lasses?

43:06.000 --> 43:07.834
Tops off.

43:12.215 --> 43:14.091
Come on!

43:16.719 --> 43:19.680
Well, no looking.
And no laughing, you bastards.

43:28.022 --> 43:30.565
l used to have a proper job, me.

43:32.193 --> 43:35.028
l ask you, what are we doing?
What are we doing?

43:44.872 --> 43:46.748
And the kecks.

44:04.392 --> 44:07.811
- Horse by name, horse by nature, eh?
- Oh, shut it, you!

44:07.895 --> 44:11.440
- How come you're so brown?
- No reason.

44:11.566 --> 44:17.154
- Someone's got a sunbed, Gerald!
- lt's Linda's, and no, you bloody can't!

44:17.238 --> 44:19.406
What am I gonna do about this?

44:19.490 --> 44:21.700
lt's not too bad.

44:21.784 --> 44:23.327
From the front, like.

44:23.411 --> 44:26.413
Fat, David, is a feminist issue.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.582
What's that supposed to mean?

44:28.666 --> 44:31.585
l don't bloody know, do l? But it is.

44:32.503 --> 44:35.172
l try dieting.

44:35.256 --> 44:37.632
l do try!

44:37.759 --> 44:41.178
lt seems l've spent
most of me fucking life on a diet!

44:41.262 --> 44:43.430
The less I eat, the fatter I get.

44:43.514 --> 44:47.517
- So stuff yourself and get thin.
- Oh, shut up, saggy tits!

44:47.602 --> 44:50.062
They're not.

44:50.146 --> 44:54.191
A mate of Linda's had this plastic stuff
put on her at this health club.

44:54.275 --> 44:57.319
She lost stones. lt were like magic.

44:57.445 --> 44:59.112
Oh, what's it called?

44:59.197 --> 45:01.698
Anyway, it's like clingfilm.

45:01.783 --> 45:04.409
- l've heard of that.
- Clingfilm?

45:04.494 --> 45:07.162
l'm not a chicken drumstick, Gerald.

45:07.288 --> 45:11.792
- You wrap it round, reduce the fat...
- She swears by it!

45:17.799 --> 45:20.592
- You can't just take stuff.
- Sorry, mate.

45:20.676 --> 45:22.761
But I only owe him 120 quid.

45:22.845 --> 45:26.932
- That's all these'll fetch second-hand.
- They're not second-hand.

45:27.016 --> 45:29.142
They are now, mate.

45:30.895 --> 45:33.814
- Put down and piss off.
- Fucking hell!

45:38.486 --> 45:42.322
l think there's been a mistake.
We'll check with the office.

45:43.366 --> 45:46.535
- Cheers, lads.
- lt's not bad, this stripping lark.

45:58.589 --> 46:00.715
Dave and Lomps, up the wing.

46:00.842 --> 46:03.385
One, two, three, four.

46:03.511 --> 46:06.096
Left touchline, three, four.

46:06.180 --> 46:08.515
Right touchline, three, four.

46:08.599 --> 46:10.851
Offside trap. One, two,

46:10.935 --> 46:13.937
three, four. Now the belt,

46:14.021 --> 46:16.148
three. Now the shoes,

46:16.232 --> 46:18.692
three, four. Now the socks...

46:18.776 --> 46:21.778
- Hang on, I can't...
- Carry on!

46:26.117 --> 46:28.118
- That were crap.
- Give us a chance!

46:28.202 --> 46:30.954
l bet even Madonna has difficulty
with her shoes.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.123
- You could've had me eye out!
- Sorry.

46:33.207 --> 46:36.418
What are you doing? They're borrowed!

46:36.544 --> 46:38.378
We can use 'em for the show.

46:38.463 --> 46:40.464
lt's what them Chippendales do.

46:40.548 --> 46:43.300
They put Velcro down the side,
and then...

46:43.384 --> 46:45.427
All is revealed. I'll sew 'em back up.

46:45.553 --> 46:47.846
Where did you learn to be an ace sewer?

46:47.930 --> 46:49.473
Prison.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.603
Cheers, Nathe.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.567
Come on, Al, it's me!

47:00.651 --> 47:04.446
Which is precisely why
it's 100 quid up front. Half-price.

47:04.572 --> 47:07.240
lf I give you t'club for nowt
and you don't turn up,

47:07.325 --> 47:10.160
l've got an empty bar on a Friday night.

47:10.244 --> 47:14.247
'Course we'll turn up!
l haven't got 100 quid!

47:15.249 --> 47:18.627
lf you tell me what you're up to,
it might help.

47:19.587 --> 47:21.671
l can't. lt's top-secret.

47:22.798 --> 47:24.925
Sorry...

47:39.440 --> 47:41.775
- All right, love?
- Hi, Mum.

47:41.859 --> 47:44.110
- What do you want?
- All right, Mand?

47:44.195 --> 47:46.488
l'm gonna get you all your money.

47:46.614 --> 47:51.076
Our money. Nathan's.
You know, for definite this time.

47:51.160 --> 47:54.955
- Yeah, right. That all?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

47:56.123 --> 48:01.002
Well, no. The thing is, Mand, you have
to speculate to accumulate, in business.

48:01.128 --> 48:05.423
- l'm not sure l'm hearing this.
- I'll get you it all. I just need a tiny bit.

48:05.508 --> 48:07.926
- You want some money?
- Yeah!

48:08.010 --> 48:11.346
Right. I need someone int' packing section.

48:11.472 --> 48:15.225
£2.50 an hour. You can start now,
if you like. Are you coming?

48:17.353 --> 48:18.812
Come on, Dad.

48:21.983 --> 48:23.191
Nathan.

48:23.317 --> 48:26.027
You can't do this, kid. lt's your savings.

48:26.153 --> 48:29.573
l can. I just need your signature.
lt says int' book.

48:29.657 --> 48:31.616
l'd like to take my money out, please.

48:31.701 --> 48:33.326
Well, you bloody well can't.

48:33.411 --> 48:37.330
- You're all right, love. lt's sorted.
- lt's my money!

48:37.415 --> 48:38.748
£100, please.

48:38.833 --> 48:42.627
When you're 18,
you can walk in and get it yourself.

48:42.712 --> 48:45.755
- You said you'd get it back.
- I know!

48:45.840 --> 48:48.133
But you don't want to listen to what I say.

48:48.217 --> 48:51.595
You said so. I believe you.

48:52.722 --> 48:54.598
You do?

48:54.682 --> 48:55.682
Yeah.

48:58.853 --> 49:00.687
Blimey, Nathe!

49:13.451 --> 49:16.369
Come on, come on! One, two!

49:26.964 --> 49:29.382
And one for luck!

50:23.771 --> 50:25.772
Yeah!

50:40.371 --> 50:41.955
lt's not straight, Lomps.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.832
Give over, it's only a poster.

50:47.336 --> 50:49.796
Christ al-bloody-mighty!

50:51.465 --> 50:52.549
All right, sweethearts?

50:54.635 --> 50:56.803
Gary the lad!
What are you up to, then, shifty?

50:56.887 --> 50:59.806
Bit of this, bit of that, bit of the other.

51:01.559 --> 51:04.936
- Just advertising for some mates.
- Oh, aye.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.397
And who's gonna come and see
your mates?

51:07.481 --> 51:10.191
We had the real thing up here
the other day.

51:10.317 --> 51:12.652
Well, us mates are better.

51:13.320 --> 51:16.698
- Better? How's that, then?
- Well...

51:18.909 --> 51:20.785
This lot go all the way.

51:20.870 --> 51:24.414
- Don't they, lads?
- The full monty? You lot?

51:25.916 --> 51:29.002
Hell-fire! That would be worth a look!

51:29.086 --> 51:31.671
- See you there, then.
- Ta-ra.

51:33.007 --> 51:37.135
- Keep your hair on.
- No way. No and never. ln that order, kid.

51:37.219 --> 51:41.222
Excuse me, no-one said anything to me
about the full monty.

51:41.348 --> 51:45.477
You heard 'em. We've gotta give them
more than your average ten-bob stripper.

51:45.561 --> 51:49.397
- Yeah, but... me willy. I mean to say...
- Your willy?

51:49.523 --> 51:52.484
- My willy!
- A laughing stock. Totally!

51:52.568 --> 51:53.777
Well, they're coming!

51:53.861 --> 51:56.488
With a pair of scissors! They know it's us.

51:56.572 --> 52:01.034
By closing time, every bugger in Sheffield
will know it's us whether we do it or not.

52:01.118 --> 52:03.953
We can forget it,
go back to fucking job club,

52:04.038 --> 52:06.664
or do it and just maybe get rich.

52:06.749 --> 52:08.500
And I tell you,

52:08.584 --> 52:12.045
folks don't laugh so loud
when you've a grand in your pocket.

52:12.713 --> 52:14.756
Now, are you in...

52:14.882 --> 52:16.090
or are you out?

52:19.303 --> 52:23.223
..all sorts of problems
for drivers on the Pennines.

52:24.058 --> 52:27.268
So, please avoid the area if possible.

52:27.394 --> 52:31.231
The good news is that the outlook
for the rest of the week is much better,

52:31.315 --> 52:35.985
with the storms clearing
to leave the weekend warm and sunny.

52:36.070 --> 52:40.448
Now, back to the music.
Here's another disco classic from the '70s.

52:40.574 --> 52:42.325
lt's Donna Summer with...

52:42.409 --> 52:43.952
"Hot Stuff".

53:43.470 --> 53:45.346
No.

53:45.472 --> 53:48.141
Gerald, come on, mate. Just an hour!

53:52.021 --> 53:54.647
You've got some fit birds in there.

53:56.817 --> 53:59.110
Nah. Tits are too big.

53:59.194 --> 54:00.320
Yeah?

54:00.404 --> 54:02.196
Didn't know they could be.

54:04.658 --> 54:07.285
Anti-wrinkle cream.

54:07.369 --> 54:09.495
Can fellas use this an' all?

54:09.580 --> 54:11.664
Do you mind, you!

54:12.833 --> 54:18.212
Well, I just pray they're a bit more
understanding about us, that's all.

54:18.339 --> 54:20.381
You what?

54:21.425 --> 54:24.802
They're gonna be looking at us like that.

54:24.887 --> 54:29.515
What if, next Friday, 400 women say:
"He's too fat, he's too old,

54:29.600 --> 54:32.518
and he's a pigeon-chested little tosser."

54:32.603 --> 54:35.772
- They wouldn't.
- Why not? He said her tits are too big.

54:35.856 --> 54:38.524
That's different. We're... blokes.

54:38.609 --> 54:40.276
Yeah. And?

54:40.361 --> 54:42.570
l think she's got nice tits.

54:42.696 --> 54:46.366
l never said owt about her personality.
She's probably quite nice.

54:46.450 --> 54:48.952
They won't say nowt
about your personality.

54:49.036 --> 54:51.245
Which is good cos you're a bastard.

54:51.372 --> 54:55.458
Bollocks to your personality!
This is what they're looking at.

54:55.542 --> 54:57.377
And I tell you summat, mate.

54:57.461 --> 55:03.049
Anti-wrinkle cream there may be,
but anti-fat-bastard cream, there is none.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.051
Here... lads.

55:11.392 --> 55:13.059
Oh, mother!

55:14.103 --> 55:15.103
Bloody hell!

55:15.187 --> 55:17.814
Gaz said he wanted
something a bit flashy.

55:17.898 --> 55:21.234
- lt's top of the range. Real leather.
- Yeah, but...

55:21.318 --> 55:23.861
- You don't get much.
- What day is it?

55:23.946 --> 55:26.823
- Monday.
- When are we on?

55:26.907 --> 55:30.076
Friday. Dress rehearsal tomorrow.

55:32.830 --> 55:34.998
l think l'm gonna be sick.

55:42.256 --> 55:44.882
How can I read the instructions?
There wasn't any.

55:44.967 --> 55:48.094
No? Well, maybe there's a part missing.

55:48.178 --> 55:51.723
Yeah, I got that. lf that's what you call it.

55:51.807 --> 55:56.185
Well, if it's all there,
how come it's not working?

55:58.439 --> 56:00.606
What do you mean, in what sense?

56:00.691 --> 56:04.527
lt's not working
in the sense that it's not working.

56:04.611 --> 56:06.279
No, I can't speak up.

56:06.363 --> 56:10.616
Nothing's happening, you know
what I mean? Nothing's getting bigger.

56:10.701 --> 56:12.952
Well, this is an emergency, is this.

57:03.670 --> 57:05.713
What's the matter, big man?

57:09.343 --> 57:11.385
l'm sorry.

57:18.727 --> 57:20.853
Dave...

57:24.608 --> 57:26.692
Dave.

57:40.124 --> 57:42.208
You're ahead.

57:42.584 --> 57:44.544
Give us a break!

57:47.881 --> 57:49.924
All right, kid.

57:52.386 --> 57:53.594
Tell us straight.

57:53.720 --> 57:56.305
We're not making the biggest arses
of ourselves in the known universe,

57:56.390 --> 57:58.266
are we?

59:08.003 --> 59:10.087
Dave, mate.

59:10.172 --> 59:13.382
Can I have a word? ln private, like.

59:14.968 --> 59:17.261
Yeah. I suppose so.

59:17.346 --> 59:20.389
Dave, you won't tell anyone, will you?

59:20.474 --> 59:23.893
No, your... Your secret's safe with me.

59:26.313 --> 59:28.564
When I were about 12,

59:28.649 --> 59:32.985
our school took us for...
for swimming lessons.

59:33.070 --> 59:35.112
Mixed classes.

59:35.197 --> 59:37.698
You know, boys...

59:37.824 --> 59:39.492
and...

59:40.827 --> 59:42.370
and girls.

59:46.166 --> 59:49.627
lt were terrible, Dave. I were there

59:49.711 --> 59:51.837
standing at t'side of t'pool in me trunks

59:51.922 --> 59:55.633
with all these pretty lassies
around in bikinis!

59:55.717 --> 59:57.885
And... Well, l...

59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.096
l got...

01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:08.020
l got a stiffy!

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:11.607
- What did you do?
- I jumped into t'deep end.

01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:14.402
l nearly fucking drowned!

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.070
What if it happens again?

01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:18.531
Think of that? ln front of 400 women!

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:20.950
Gerald,

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:23.703
you're talking to t'wrong man.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:33.129
- You said it were just your mum.
- lt's family.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:36.590
- What can you do?
- Who the hell-fire's that?

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.761
Oh, no.

01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:42.555
lt's Beryl.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.141
Me niece!

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:46.392
Where's Dave?

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:54.191
'Ere, Dave!

01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:56.027
Dave!

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:58.112
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:01.699
We're on in three days' time!
Where the fuck are you?

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:04.702
l'm 'ere, working! Earning! That's where.

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:06.829
Not pissing about!

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:08.748
End of chat.

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:12.293
Dave.

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:15.004
- Come on, Dave.
- No.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:17.089
All right, then.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:20.259
- Very nice.
- Gaz, please, don't.

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:22.303
Come on, Mr. Security Guard. Do your job.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:23.387
Gazza!

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:27.475
Horse, go out and tell 'em there's a delay.

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:28.976
They won't wait forever.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:44.867
Keep up, you fat bastard!

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:51.791
Don't ever call me a fat bastard, all right?

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.627
- All right?
- We need you, Dave.

01:01:57.506 --> 01:01:59.632
l can't.

01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:05.971
l just can't. All right?

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:12.186
Listen, just think of the most boring thing
you can come up with.

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:15.189
- That should keep it well in order.
- Like what?

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:18.692
- Double-glazing salesmen.
- Gardening. The Queen's speech.

01:02:18.819 --> 01:02:20.778
A Dire Straits double album.

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:24.240
- Nature programs.
- I like nature programs.

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:27.868
Aye, but they don't give you a hard-on,
though, do they?

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.620
Do they?

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:33.165
- Blimey...
- Oh, shut up! lt's not funny. lt's medical.

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:40.714
He's not coming.

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:43.676
We can do without him.

01:04:27.656 --> 01:04:30.616
So your daddy dances in front of you?

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.369
When he's rehearsing.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.961
We were dancing all right then, an' all.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.963
My feet are freezing.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:46.715
Right. Name.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.884
Gary Schofield.

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:55.349
- Gerald Arthur Cooper.
- What?

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:57.518
Gerald Arthur Cooper.

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:03.148
- Barrington Mitchell.
- Barrington?

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:04.650
Yeah.

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.819
- ls that one R?
- Two.

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:32.553
Told you. Robbing pipes, that's all.

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:33.762
Gary, my friend,

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:36.557
no bugger robs pipes in the buff.

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:38.100
We do.

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:40.185
Don't get your clothes dirty, do you?

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:46.942
Oh. Well, don't fret, gents. There's
a right good laundry in Wakefield prison.

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:53.157
Security-camera tapes off the front desk.

01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:54.575
What happened to the security guard?

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:08.422
You're always ahead there.

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:10.924
You're always bloody behind, more like.

01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:15.804
Look... Excuse me,
can I borrow this for a second?

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:18.474
Look, shut up, will you? Watch.

01:06:22.354 --> 01:06:24.021
He's right.

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:26.357
- You're ahead.
- Oh, go... bollocks!

01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:50.881
Be quiet! Me mum'll hear.

01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:53.884
l've always wanted to meet your mum.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.481
What do you mean, I can't see him?
He's me son! I haven't been charged!

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:09.650
Ask Smiler in there! No charge!

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:13.278
Sorry. Social Services have requested
an interview with you.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:16.031
Have to make an appointment.

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:23.372
- l've come to pick up my son.
- Oh, right...

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:25.457
Just a minute.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:27.876
He's fine. We've not been charged or owt.

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:31.714
So this is your great money-making
enterprise? Pornography?

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:34.091
Don't be daft! We're getting your money.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:36.510
My money? Nathan's money!

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:38.679
- Here he is.
- All right, Dad?

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:41.974
- All right, kid?
- Yeah, fine. Hi, Mum.

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:43.517
Come on, love.

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:45.269
We're going now.

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:47.438
- Come on, Mand!
- Unemployed,

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:52.025
maintenance arrears of £700,
and now an arrest for indecent exposure.

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:54.778
- Still think you're a good father?
- He is trying.

01:07:54.863 --> 01:07:57.656
- See?
- A bit late for that.

01:07:57.741 --> 01:08:01.034
- Hang on a minute!
- Look at yourself, Gary!

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:03.495
Just look at yourself.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.533
All right, mate?

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:44.620
So.

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:49.291
And this has been going on how long?

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:54.254
About six months.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:03.430
l can cope with losing the sunbed.

01:09:03.515 --> 01:09:05.599
Car. Television.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:10.270
l can even cope with the shame
of everyone watching this.

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:13.774
But six months! Six bloody months!

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:15.984
And you wouldn't say to me,

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.404
to your wife.

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:26.411
l thought you liked them.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:28.663
No, Gerald. l've never liked 'em.

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:57.484
They've taken me sunbed.
They've taken bloody everything.

01:09:57.569 --> 01:10:00.612
- Kept hold of your chips, though.
- House repossessed.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.573
Wife thrown me out.

01:10:02.657 --> 01:10:05.242
Guess what.

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:07.703
l've just been offered that job.

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:09.705
Congratulations.

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:19.506
- All right, kid?
- Hiya!

01:10:19.591 --> 01:10:22.593
- Fancy a kick-about int' park?
- Yeah.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.138
Nathe.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.056
Hiya. All right, love?

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:29.725
You shouldn't be here.

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:32.811
- Says who?
- Read the lawyer's letter, why don't you?

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:37.441
We're going swimming, Dad.
Do you wanna come?

01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:42.779
l can't, kid.

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:44.990
Haven't brought me trunks, have l?

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:48.577
- We can go get 'em. Can't we, Mum?
- I can't, love.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.793
l just can't. Sorry.

01:10:58.046 --> 01:11:00.631
He's not allowed, is he?

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.637
Come on, love.

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:46.343

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:48.720
Oi, you deaf twat!

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:51.306
What do you want now?
l told you, l'm finished with you.

01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:53.475
We're all finished, Dave.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:55.936
l'm a bloody marked man now.

01:11:57.772 --> 01:12:01.066
Sorry about your Nathan.
lt's a bad one, that.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.235
Aye.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:05.654
lt's about Lomper.

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:08.198
What's that pasty-faced chuffer want?

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.367
His mum died two days ago.

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:15.497
Poor lad. Sorry.

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:17.499
Could you borrow us a jacket for t'funeral?

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:18.667
Gaz... !

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:22.879
Come on, Dave!
lt's not for me, it's a funeral!

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:27.134
What color?

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:30.470
Orange.

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:33.473
- Orange?
- Black, for fuck's sake!

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:36.268
All right. Look, I'll meet you by t'doors.

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:50.407
- Nice one.
- Come on, then.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:53.160
- Have you got some time off?
- Nah.

01:12:53.244 --> 01:12:55.495
Fucking pick'n'mix
were driving me crazy.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.456
Besides, it's a funeral.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.667
- Are you ready?
- Ready when you are.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:13.156
They bloody are, you know.

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:14.866
They're holding hands.

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:17.911
- They're never.
- Straight up.

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:21.623
l never even hold hands
with ruddy lassies.

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:23.416
Maybe I should.

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:28.004
Ah, who'd have ruddy thought it, eh?

01:14:29.674 --> 01:14:33.093
Ah, well. There's nowt as queer as folk.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.557
l said, "There's nowt as queer as folk"!

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:41.476
Shut up, Dave.
lt's supposed to be a bloody funeral.

01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:43.728
l'm sorry.

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:55.699
- Look! Who's that?
- lt's that guy!

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:57.868
Show us your pecs!

01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:03.582
They were together in the paper.

01:15:08.588 --> 01:15:12.090
Have you been actively seeking work
over the last fortnight?

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:13.300
Yeah.

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:17.262
Have you done any work,
paid or unpaid, over the last fortnight?

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.847
No.

01:15:20.892 --> 01:15:23.185
That's not what l've heard.

01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:13.401
Right, come on, you lot!

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:19.407
"Slaidburn."

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:25.622
One, two, three, four.

01:17:04.996 --> 01:17:07.706
- Go get shagged!
- Get your knickers off!

01:17:12.712 --> 01:17:15.213
Oh, fuck!

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.882
Hey, Patricia the Stripper!

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:21.052
- Bugger off.
- Where have you bloody been?

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:25.640
What's going on? I had to buy 20 barrels!
l've had no word from you!

01:17:25.725 --> 01:17:27.851
l hope they're sale or return.

01:17:27.935 --> 01:17:30.186
You're joking! You're bloody famous!

01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:32.564
Yeah, don't remind me.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:35.734
- l've sold 200-odd tickets!
- How many?

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:38.611
Well done, Gerald. All the best.

01:17:38.696 --> 01:17:41.573
Hey! Example for you there!

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:48.330
- Nice suit, Gerald!
- Yeah.

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:50.498
Well, l'd best be off.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:54.544
You never know,
there might be a job in it for you boys.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:56.421
- All right, lads?
- All right, Gaz?

01:17:56.505 --> 01:18:00.091
- Gareth.
- We're on.

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:01.301
We're bloody on!

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:05.221
- You what?
- We've sold 200 tickets. That's two grand!

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:08.892
lt's a bit late for all that, Gaz.
l mean...

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:11.353
l mean fresh start, you know.

01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:13.021
One more time, Gerald.

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:16.900
You got the rest of your fucking life
to wear a suit!

01:18:16.984 --> 01:18:18.735
- Gerald...
- Aye, go on!

01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:20.362
Come on, Gerald.

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:25.909
- Just once.
- Yes!

01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:28.828
That's all. Just tonight.

01:18:30.498 --> 01:18:33.541
How about it, Dave?

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:36.669
Haven't you grown out of all that yet?

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:39.130
Come on, mate.

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:41.800
Nah. Sorry, lads.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.310
Jean?

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:55.939
Jean, love!

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:05.448
There you are.

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:14.416
l should have guessed
when you started wearing totty lotion.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.876
You never put it on for me, did you?

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:19.212
- Jean?
- Or this?

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:24.968
l never had you down
for this sort of caper, David.

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:27.512
lt explains a few things, at least.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:30.306
No, look...
l know it don't look good.

01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:32.976
You're bloody right it don't.

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:36.646
All those nights you were late back

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:40.984
and stupid cow here thought
you were out looking for a job!

01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:42.777
Well, no wonder.

01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:45.071
No bloody wonder.

01:19:45.156 --> 01:19:48.533
- lt's so obvious.
- No, I were with Gaz, honest.

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:52.829
Oh, right!
She's one of Gaz's little tarts, is she?

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:54.706
Well, that makes sense.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:58.918
She'd have to be
to put up with this kind of shit!

01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:05.008
Just listen, will you?
lt's nowt to do with any fucking women!

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.762

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:11.514
l were a stripper, right?

01:20:11.599 --> 01:20:13.516
Me and Gaz and...

01:20:13.601 --> 01:20:17.353
some fellas thought we'd make a bob
or two taking us clothes off.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:21.566
Strippers?

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:24.027
All right, all right, I know.

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:27.363
You... and Gaz?

01:20:27.448 --> 01:20:29.115
Strippers?

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.284
We weren't that bad.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:35.747
Only I couldn't, could l?

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.917
Why not?

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:40.960
Well, look at me.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:45.173
So?

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:50.136
Jeanie, who wants to see this dance?

01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:53.890
Me, Dave.

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:57.101

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.044
Women only, you tosser!

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:26.714
Women only!
lt's on all t'posters, for fuck's sake.

01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:29.592
No, nobody told me.

01:21:29.677 --> 01:21:31.803
All the blokes from t'pub are in there.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:36.140
- Bastards!
- You'll be all right once you're on stage.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:37.684
Once l'm on stage?

01:21:37.768 --> 01:21:43.231
l'm going nowhere near the fucking stage!
lt's suicide! That's what it is! Suicide!

01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:54.784
Come on, come on! Come on, come on!

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:57.453
Come on, come on! Come on!

01:21:58.289 --> 01:22:00.498
Shit! I'll give the money back.

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:02.292
Alan, announce it, please.

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:06.337
To 400 horny punters?
Ask me another one, kid!

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:07.422
By 'eck!

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:10.633
Our old dinner lady's ont' front row!

01:22:10.718 --> 01:22:13.845
- We'll get torn to pieces!
- You will if you don't go on!

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:16.764
Ever seen a zebra brought down
by a pack of wolves?

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:19.934
These nature films.
Aren't they marvelous?

01:22:20.019 --> 01:22:21.352
Brilliant, aren't they?

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:24.439
- They are, aren't they, Gerald?
- Oh, pack it in!

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:27.692
- Not lost your bottle, have you, Gaz?
- Dave!

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:30.695
There were nowt on telly
so I thought l'd give it a go.

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:34.532
- I found this wandering about outside.
- They wouldn't let me in.

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:37.619
What the hell are you doing 'ere?
Your mum'll go mad!

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:40.747
- She's out front.
- ls she?

01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:42.206
ls Barry with her?

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:44.417
She wouldn't let him come.
Said it were women only.

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:48.755
Right! I can't hold them any longer!
lt's now or never!

01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:53.926
We're bloody on.
Go get your jacket on.

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:59.349
Can't we leave us G-strings on, Gaz?

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:00.850
Perhaps you better had.

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:03.019
No, we better hadn't.

01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:06.856
Listen.
lf we're doing this, then just this once,

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:09.400
we're doing it right.

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:10.568
Now, come on.

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:14.614
Come on, put your hands together

01:23:14.698 --> 01:23:16.991
and welcome Mr. Dave Horsefall!

01:23:26.585 --> 01:23:30.046
OK, ladies and gents...
and you buggers up the back there!

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:32.423
Get on with it!

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:34.217
We may not be young,

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:37.011
we may not be pretty,
we may not be right good,

01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:39.222
but we're here.

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.683
We're live, and for one night only

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:44.727
we're going for the full monty!

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:48.606
You can't miss it, not after everything.

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:53.236
- Come on, Gaz! Hurry up!
- Sorry, lads.

01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:57.448
Good luck, eh?

01:24:28.439 --> 01:24:31.190
Listen.
l'm gonna get really annoyed with you.

01:24:31.275 --> 01:24:33.609
They're cheering out there. You did that.

01:24:33.694 --> 01:24:35.945
Now get out there and do your stuff.

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:38.614
God, is there anyone
l don't get bollocked by?

01:24:38.699 --> 01:24:40.783
Out!

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:35.523
Off! Off! Off!
