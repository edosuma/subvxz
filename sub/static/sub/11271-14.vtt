00:19.264 --> 00:24.102
When I hear "A Foggy Day
In London Town", I think of my wife.

00:24.268 --> 00:26.270
Was that your song, Coach?

00:26.437 --> 00:33.568
No, but Sinatra sang that and it always
reminds me of "From Here To Eternity".

00:33.735 --> 00:38.823
- You took her to see it on the first date?
- No, it reminds me of Hawaii.

00:38.989 --> 00:41.991
You and your wife met in Hawaii?

00:42.158 --> 00:46.829
No, I've never been to Hawaii.
Neither has Wally Engels.

00:47.996 --> 00:51.958
I'll take it. Coach, who's Wally Engels?

00:52.125 --> 00:56.670
An old paI of mine in the navy.
He introduced me to my wife.

00:58.839 --> 01:02.550
Boy,
that's some memory you've got there.

01:09.556 --> 01:14.685
- That song brings back great memories.
- Really? What?

01:14.852 --> 01:17.687
They played it
the day my daughter got married.

01:22.941 --> 01:25.360
That's all.

01:26.445 --> 01:29.446
We sure get 'em in here, don't we?

02:43.924 --> 02:45.342
Hello, Sam.

02:46.259 --> 02:52.221
- Hey, Becky. Boy, long time no see.
- I finally got transferred back to Boston.

02:52.388 --> 02:58.518
I missed this city and its landmarks.
Speaking of which, when do you get off?

02:58.685 --> 03:01.146
I don't get off any more, Becky.

03:04.899 --> 03:09.903
What I meant by that was Diane
and I are going together here.

03:10.070 --> 03:13.155
- Who?
- Diane, this is Becky Hawley.

03:15.616 --> 03:20.703
Diane and I have been going together
for what? Nine, ten months?

03:20.870 --> 03:24.373
- Four.
- Whatever.

03:24.539 --> 03:28.293
I'm glad to see
you have a nice thing going,

03:28.460 --> 03:32.713
although I must say
I will miss the fun we used to have.

03:33.673 --> 03:39.302
I got something a lot better than fun.
I got good solid pleasantness.

03:40.678 --> 03:43.097
You're a reaI rush yourself.

03:43.263 --> 03:46.641
- I didn't mean to upset anyone.
- You didn't.

03:46.808 --> 03:52.062
I've come to terms with Sam's past.
Besides, I'm not the jealous type.

03:52.229 --> 03:56.148
- Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Good to see you again.

03:56.315 --> 04:01.569
- You, too.
- Why don't I walk you to your car?

04:05.490 --> 04:08.742
On second thoughts, I'll stand in the bar.

04:10.786 --> 04:13.413
- I liked her.
- I'll bet.

04:20.043 --> 04:24.046
Have an accident, Sam,
or are you just glad to see me?

04:25.381 --> 04:27.424
Both.

04:27.590 --> 04:31.136
Two Cutty rocks.
Norm's late again today.

04:31.302 --> 04:37.558
I noticed. It's eating into my beer profits.
I'll have to raise prices to get even.

04:37.724 --> 04:41.144
That'll be $11, Cliff.

04:41.310 --> 04:44.896
He hasn't been in
before five o'clock all week.

04:45.063 --> 04:48.150
You don't suppose he finally got a job?

04:48.316 --> 04:51.861
If Norm had a job,
he'd have told us about it.

04:52.027 --> 04:54.737
I hope he didn't tell me and I forgot.

04:54.904 --> 04:58.408
I'd remember forgetting
something that big.

04:58.575 --> 05:03.537
Cliff's right. If Norm got a job,
he would have made it a big deaI.

05:03.704 --> 05:07.957
You know, yesterday I saw something
very disturbing.

05:08.124 --> 05:10.750
The price of peroxide went up?

05:11.835 --> 05:13.879
I was born a blonde.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.214
What were you saying?

05:18.299 --> 05:23.303
Well, on my way here, I saw a fellow
who looked very much like Norman,

05:23.469 --> 05:27.306
sneaking in the back door
of Melville's kitchen.

05:27.472 --> 05:32.101
I said hi, but he pulled his coat
over his face and ran inside.

05:32.268 --> 05:35.396
Why would he be in Melville's kitchen?

05:35.563 --> 05:40.567
I think he's been reduced
to taking a job as a dishwasher.

05:40.734 --> 05:47.822
No. Norm would never stoop to that. He
probably went in to beg for table scraps.

05:47.989 --> 05:53.410
- Wait a minute. I thought of something.
- I thought I heard a clank.

05:55.454 --> 06:00.416
About a week ago, Norm asked me
if a reaI man would wash dishes.

06:02.376 --> 06:06.671
- I don't believe it.
- Impossible to escape the conclusion.

06:06.838 --> 06:09.882
I found a way.

06:11.133 --> 06:16.930
I'm not going to believe that my buddy
has been reduced to scrubbing pots.

06:17.096 --> 06:21.850
If he had, there's be signs.
He'd be reeking like a mackereI.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.854
Go on! Beat it! Scram! Get out of here!

06:31.441 --> 06:34.652
Beat it! Get out of here!

06:39.198 --> 06:41.449
Go on! Get out of here!

06:43.660 --> 06:47.120
That proves it.
He's either washing dishes,

06:47.287 --> 06:50.289
or driving a herd of cats to Dodge City.

06:50.456 --> 06:54.460
He'd need at least 200 head
for that drive to Dodge.

06:54.627 --> 06:56.878
Afternoon, everybody.

06:57.045 --> 07:02.383
- Can I draw you a beer?
- I know what they look like. Pour one.

07:03.550 --> 07:05.594
What's with all the cats?

07:05.761 --> 07:09.764
- Animals like me.
- Good. Cos no human is gonna.

07:12.557 --> 07:16.811
Norm,
you smell like low tide in Bridgeport.

07:16.977 --> 07:22.565
- It must be that tuna sandwich I ate.
- What did you do, eat it or roll in it?

07:22.732 --> 07:26.069
Everything OK? Any luck finding a job?

07:26.236 --> 07:30.948
- Let's just drop it.
- Here, Normie. You need a napkin.

07:32.032 --> 07:35.952
Look at your hands.
They're all red and wrinkled.

07:36.119 --> 07:38.245
So's your brain.

07:39.913 --> 07:45.584
I'm sorry, Coach. Everybody, I'm sorry.
I might as well come clean here.

07:45.751 --> 07:48.379
Please!

07:48.545 --> 07:55.217
I'm washing dishes. The unemployment
ran out. I had to do something.

07:55.384 --> 07:58.762
Give me your hands.
This'll cut the smell.

07:58.929 --> 08:02.348
Norman,
you must be hopelessly depressed.

08:03.433 --> 08:08.061
Last night I was so depressed,
I almost jumped out my window.

08:08.228 --> 08:12.606
There were so many cats,
they would have broken the fall.

08:12.773 --> 08:16.025
Those guys are only a scouting party.

08:17.193 --> 08:20.612
Go on! Get out of here!

08:23.740 --> 08:27.451
There's dignity in any work.
Don't be ashamed.

08:27.618 --> 08:32.998
I know exactly how Normie feels. When
I was a youngster, I was a busboy.

08:33.164 --> 08:38.251
And the getting ordered around,
it's more than a man can take.

08:38.419 --> 08:42.589
- Get a beer over here, Grandpa.
- Right away.

08:42.755 --> 08:48.760
Dishwasher. I guess I've sunk about
as low as an accountant can sink.

08:48.927 --> 08:54.932
I was 30th in my class. Now I spend
my afternoons watching lettuce float.

08:55.099 --> 08:59.519
Norman, you're an accountant.
You should be accounting.

08:59.686 --> 09:02.938
Sam, put Norman on as your accountant.

09:03.105 --> 09:06.650
- That would be fabulous.
- I already have one.

09:06.817 --> 09:10.028
Well, fire him and hire Norman.

09:10.194 --> 09:13.697
- Can I speak to you over here?
- Certainly.

09:13.864 --> 09:19.535
- Don't you think it's a good idea?
- I want to tell her how much I like it.

09:19.702 --> 09:23.414
Ms Chambers is going
to get a buss on the cheek.

09:23.581 --> 09:26.374
Let's hope it's going at least 80.

09:31.086 --> 09:33.130
No. Listen.

09:33.297 --> 09:39.218
There are two areas of my life I don't
want touched. I've told you about one.

09:39.385 --> 09:43.555
- And I didn't.
- You've been very good about that.

09:43.722 --> 09:48.726
The other area is my business.
I worked very hard to get this bar.

09:48.893 --> 09:53.730
Now you've got me turning
my books over to a dishwasher.

09:53.897 --> 09:58.984
- He's not a dishwasher. He's a friend.
- Right, he's my friend.

09:59.151 --> 10:04.906
How do I know he's a good accountant?
He hasn't been hired for over a year.

10:05.073 --> 10:08.617
So he's highly motivated
to do a good job.

10:08.784 --> 10:12.203
Keep him on long enough
to get his pride back.

10:12.370 --> 10:17.165
I won't put you on the spot.
I don't have to be your accountant.

10:17.332 --> 10:21.878
- I can always just kill myself.
- This man has options here.

10:22.961 --> 10:27.674
Sam, now, it's true,
hiring Norman has emotionaI overtones,

10:27.840 --> 10:32.470
but, without emotions,
the mind becomes a stagnant pond.

10:32.636 --> 10:38.224
Let's face it, in your case, we're not
dealing with white water rapids.

10:39.892 --> 10:42.603
OK. All right, fine. I'll put Norm on.

10:42.770 --> 10:48.857
But when I fire him, you'll be responsible
for him losing all his self-respect.

10:49.024 --> 10:53.070
How can we miss
with such a positive attitude?

10:53.237 --> 10:56.155
Norm, you're my new accountant.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.367
Sammy, I am honoured.

11:01.451 --> 11:04.703
This is one of the great moments
of my life.

11:04.870 --> 11:09.083
- One of your great moments?
- There have only been two.

11:09.250 --> 11:13.586
I know this is out of pity,
but you got the best accountant.

11:13.753 --> 11:17.423
- I'll second that.
- That he's the best?

11:17.589 --> 11:20.258
That he's doing it out of pity.

11:26.263 --> 11:31.892
Here he is. Norm "Render Unto Caesar
That Which Is Zilch" Peterson!

11:34.979 --> 11:38.565
- Diane, more coffee, please.
- I'm proud of you.

11:38.731 --> 11:41.733
There's a job to do
and you put beer aside.

11:41.900 --> 11:45.737
- I want to do a good job for Sammy.
- Isn't that nice?

11:45.904 --> 11:50.324
- Isn't that nice, Sam?
- How's it going, Norm?

11:50.491 --> 11:53.743
Almost done.
You won't be disappointed.

11:53.910 --> 11:59.331
I found a few things. You'll have the best
tax return ever to be audited.

11:59.498 --> 12:02.418
Lighten up, will you? It's a tax joke.

12:03.793 --> 12:08.422
There's a bounce in his step
I haven't seen in months.

12:08.589 --> 12:13.135
Tonight may be a turning point
in his life. His job complete.

12:13.301 --> 12:17.930
- He may even make amends with Vera.
- That would be wonderfuI.

12:18.097 --> 12:24.518
Or he might drink till he passes out with
his head in the toilet. Too close to call.

12:25.603 --> 12:29.105
I hope he's not trying too hard
to impress me.

12:29.272 --> 12:33.443
What if he is? You helped him out.
He appreciates that.

12:33.610 --> 12:36.862
I don't like taking chances with the IRS.

12:37.029 --> 12:42.158
I was satisfied with my old accountant.
I paid three grand in taxes.

12:42.325 --> 12:46.953
There's be no trouble.
That's all I want from Norm. No risks.

12:47.120 --> 12:51.540
- You worry. He's a great accountant.
- How do you know?

12:51.707 --> 12:55.752
My mother said everybody
has one thing they're great at.

12:55.919 --> 13:02.299
With Norm, we've eliminated everything
but accountant and great white hunter.

13:02.466 --> 13:05.719
- Here we go, Sam.
- How'd it come out, Norm?

13:05.886 --> 13:11.598
- I'II let my return speak for itself.
- I'm getting back $15,000?

13:13.308 --> 13:15.560
We make camp here, Bwana.

13:25.516 --> 13:29.478
Of course babies can eat pizza.
Put it in the blender.

13:31.229 --> 13:33.939
Do you have a cigarette machine?

13:34.106 --> 13:37.026
- Back room.
- Thank you, beautifuI.

13:37.193 --> 13:40.028
- What did you call me?
- BeautifuI.

13:40.195 --> 13:44.156
- Sounded different the first time.
- BeautifuI.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.366
That was the word.

13:48.659 --> 13:51.370
Afternoon, everybody.

13:52.455 --> 13:55.499
- A beer, Norm?
- I'm high on life.

13:55.665 --> 14:01.462
Of course beer is my life. There's
my boss man. How's it going, buddy?

14:01.629 --> 14:05.131
Pretty good.
Waiting for that big tax refund.

14:05.298 --> 14:08.218
What are you going to do with it?

14:08.384 --> 14:13.013
I think that some of it should go
for something sheer, sexy

14:13.180 --> 14:18.017
and a little breathtaking,
for the speciaI someone in his life.

14:18.184 --> 14:21.603
You're right.
Are you an extra large, Norm?

14:21.770 --> 14:26.732
In peignoirs,
but I can squeeze into a large teddy.

14:26.899 --> 14:29.526
Wait. You gotta check these out.

14:32.028 --> 14:38.367
Printed matches. "Norm Peterson
Incorporated, An Accountancy Firm. "

14:38.533 --> 14:42.787
- That's very impressive.
- Business must be good.

14:42.954 --> 14:49.334
Yeah. It just took Sammy having faith in
me and my getting a little faith in myself.

14:49.501 --> 14:53.504
- Bingo.
- How many new clients have you got?

14:53.671 --> 14:57.632
Just one, but I've been hustling
and I got some nibbles.

14:57.799 --> 15:01.511
Which reminds me.
Diane, here's your return.

15:04.596 --> 15:07.849
- Nice refund.
- I thought you'd like that.

15:08.015 --> 15:11.268
Those psychiatrist fees
were deductible.

15:11.435 --> 15:15.730
Those sessions in February,
we're talking a gold mine.

15:18.233 --> 15:20.317
Shut up. I'm better.

15:24.821 --> 15:27.991
February was a rough month, wasn't it?

15:29.783 --> 15:34.662
What you've done for Norman
is a miracle. I'm proud of you.

15:34.829 --> 15:37.623
- It was nothing.
- Don't be modest.

15:37.790 --> 15:39.833
You stood by him.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.587
When he said you were getting
$15,000, even I blanched

15:44.754 --> 15:49.466
and money means no more to me
than it does to beasts in the field.

15:49.633 --> 15:52.635
Sammy, give me a hand with this stuff.

15:54.262 --> 15:56.638
Coach, will you get that?

15:57.806 --> 16:01.642
- Cheers. It's for you.
- I'm busy. Take a message.

16:01.809 --> 16:04.520
Can I take a message? He's busy.

16:08.940 --> 16:12.192
It was your accountant.
He was saying...

16:12.359 --> 16:16.488
Bell Day.

16:19.115 --> 16:23.076
And he said your tax returns are ready.

16:24.161 --> 16:29.165
- What the hell's going on here?
- Do you mean about Bell Day?

16:29.331 --> 16:33.585
Did you send in the return
I prepared for you or not?

16:33.752 --> 16:35.795
No, Norm, I didn't.

16:38.297 --> 16:40.340
Why not?

16:40.507 --> 16:45.011
I should have said. I'm conservative
when it comes to money.

16:45.178 --> 16:49.806
Let me get this straight.
You don't trust me or my work.

16:49.973 --> 16:52.893
So you had somebody else
do your taxes.

16:53.059 --> 16:58.063
A $15,000 refund scared me.
I've never gotten a refund before.

16:58.230 --> 17:01.483
You know why?
That accountant is a wimp.

17:01.649 --> 17:05.319
The guy wouldn't know a deduction
if he sat on it.

17:05.486 --> 17:10.198
What are you trying to say,
that Norm pulled a $15,000 boner?

17:11.281 --> 17:16.536
I was trying to protect myself.
You would have done the same thing.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.414
Come on. You would and you know it.

17:22.708 --> 17:27.921
Let's drop this. I didn't want Norm
to do my taxes in the first place.

17:28.087 --> 17:30.964
You don't do business with friends.

17:31.131 --> 17:36.385
Then you're safe going into business
with anybody in this room.

17:36.552 --> 17:39.639
Come on. Isn't anybody on my side?

17:40.598 --> 17:46.061
AII I wanted to do was protect
my business and not offend Norm.

17:46.228 --> 17:52.190
I'm standing by you. I may not agree
with you, but I admire your courage.

17:52.357 --> 17:57.611
- You do?
- I've stood against the majority.

17:57.778 --> 18:02.407
Resisting public opinion
for the sake of personaI principle.

18:02.574 --> 18:04.617
Is that right? Like what?

18:04.784 --> 18:09.037
In my senior year,
I fought to integrate my sorority.

18:09.204 --> 18:12.791
You hear this?
They wouldn't let blacks in?

18:12.958 --> 18:16.293
It wasn't blacks. That's not the point.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.836
What was it, some other race?

18:20.672 --> 18:23.091
A religion?

18:23.257 --> 18:26.510
- It wasn't a religion.
- Come on. Who?

18:28.553 --> 18:31.806
What? Who wouldn't they let in?

18:32.848 --> 18:37.852
Girls with poorly-publicised
coming-out parties.

18:41.271 --> 18:45.233
Within a couple of months,
they blended right in.

18:45.400 --> 18:49.988
- You don't trust me as a friend.
- Stop right there.

18:50.154 --> 18:56.242
- You separate business from friendship.
- I'm separating you from my life.

18:56.409 --> 19:00.413
If I get into trouble with the IRS,
I could go to jaiI

19:00.579 --> 19:04.582
and you know
what happens to pretty boys in jaiI.

19:05.917 --> 19:11.130
- Your attitude is unprofessionaI.
- You know what you are?

19:11.296 --> 19:15.425
- Don't say anything...
- You're a backstabber.

19:15.591 --> 19:18.009
- You're a big baby.
- Hair hat.

19:18.176 --> 19:21.430
- Ham-hock.
- Gooseneck. This is fun.

19:22.513 --> 19:26.058
We are not the ones fighting,
spaghetti breath.

19:26.225 --> 19:29.936
- You're a bad guy.
- You're getting on my nerves.

19:30.103 --> 19:34.148
- The truth hurts?
- Will you listen to yourselves?

19:34.314 --> 19:37.568
Standing there, arguing, bickering!

19:37.735 --> 19:40.987
You're making
a mockery out of Bell Day!

19:45.949 --> 19:51.162
Sammy, I've just been through
the roughest year of my life.

19:51.328 --> 19:54.414
What kept me going
was a belief in myself.

19:54.581 --> 19:57.500
I hoped somebody would believe in me.

19:57.667 --> 20:01.587
- I thought it was you.
- You're laying a guilt trip.

20:01.754 --> 20:04.630
- That stinks.
- I'm going for good.

20:04.797 --> 20:09.135
Don't come back here
thinking this will blow over.

20:10.385 --> 20:15.139
As a matter of fact,
I don't want you back in my bar again.

20:15.306 --> 20:17.933
Fine. You got it.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.770
I gotta settle one thing with him.

20:22.937 --> 20:26.690
Norman, wait.
Don't do anything silly. Please.

20:26.857 --> 20:31.527
Stay out. It is part of the male rituaI
you know nothing about.

20:33.404 --> 20:36.490
- Coming in!
- How do you want to do this?

20:38.950 --> 20:40.994
I don't want to go.

20:43.787 --> 20:47.499
Hey. Come on. I didn't mean that you...

20:54.129 --> 20:56.548
Come on. Listen.

20:56.715 --> 21:02.720
We're not going to get anywhere
unless you start acting like an adult.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.930
Come on.

21:10.517 --> 21:12.561
Here.

21:21.068 --> 21:26.155
This bar's all I have, Sam.
The people are my family.

21:28.449 --> 21:32.869
- You're my brother.
- You're my brother, too.

21:51.467 --> 21:55.179
Norm, you're my accountant.

21:57.263 --> 22:00.976
- You mean it, Sam?
- Right after this tax season.

22:03.978 --> 22:07.522
I'll take it, but I don't want to beg.

22:11.484 --> 22:18.531
The roots of physicaI aggression in the
male is found in the DNA molecule itself.

22:20.491 --> 22:24.744
Right up here.
About one o'clock, as I recall.

22:24.911 --> 22:28.414
- Fascinating, Cliff.
- Yes, fascinating.

22:28.580 --> 22:33.710
Hold onto your hat, too, because the
very letters DNA are an acronym

22:33.876 --> 22:37.130
for the words
"Dames Are Not Aggressive".

22:40.632 --> 22:44.093
They stand for deoxyribonucleic acid.

22:44.260 --> 22:49.848
Yes, but parse that in a Latin declension
and my point is still moot.

22:53.184 --> 22:58.272
If a little knowledge is dangerous,
you are a walking time bomb.

22:58.439 --> 23:00.481
Thank you, Diane.

23:01.566 --> 23:05.193
Let's talk about the gas turbine engine.

23:09.656 --> 23:12.908
- Coach, buy my buddy a beer.
- Coming up.

23:13.075 --> 23:15.785
So you didn't resort to violence?

23:15.952 --> 23:18.788
I want you to meet my new accountant.

23:21.915 --> 23:23.792
Congratulations.

23:23.959 --> 23:28.379
I've been with the wrong guy
for the last ten years.

23:28.546 --> 23:31.882
- Thanks, Sam.
- Thank you, Norm.

23:35.510 --> 23:38.053
This is such a beautifuI moment.

23:38.220 --> 23:42.474
Seeing you two friends reconcile,
I could almost cry.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.851
Girls.

24:21.964 --> 24:22.965
English

24:23.305 --> 24:29.935
