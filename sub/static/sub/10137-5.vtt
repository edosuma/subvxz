08:05.277 --> 08:06.445
I'm hungry.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.821
I hope you have

08:06.486 --> 08:07.821
something better

08:07.862 --> 08:10.782
than that healthy

08:07.862 --> 08:10.782
junk you had yesterday.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.958
Hey, Michelle.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.958
How's it going with Aaron?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.127
How do I look

08:20.000 --> 08:22.127
like it's going?

08:23.378 --> 08:25.005
Aw, honey.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.005
It won't be much longer.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.632
I just, I promised his mom,

08:25.046 --> 08:27.632
I'd, you know, I'd help her out

08:27.674 --> 08:30.344
until his regular

08:27.674 --> 08:30.344
babysitter stops twitching.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.472
This fridge is a joke!

08:33.513 --> 08:36.808
No Ding Dongs, no Ho Hos,

08:33.513 --> 08:36.808
no Nutty Buddies.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.893
It's bone dry!

08:40.603 --> 08:41.688
I have raisins.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.440
I'm allergic to raisins.

08:43.482 --> 08:46.860
My lips blow up and I can't

08:43.482 --> 08:46.860
talk when I eat raisins.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.863
Raisins it is, then.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.242
He's so cute, and his

08:51.531 --> 08:54.242
locker's right next to mine.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.743
I can smell his gym socks.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.786
[Mickey laughs]

08:56.828 --> 08:58.330
Hey, hey.

08:58.372 --> 09:01.666
Hey, dad. This is a friend

08:58.372 --> 09:01.666
of mine, Mickey from school.

09:01.708 --> 09:05.253
A new friend! Well,

09:01.708 --> 09:05.253
what did I tell you?

09:05.295 --> 09:07.381
It's nice to meet you.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.381
This is a great occasion.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.049
I just want you to know,

09:07.422 --> 09:09.049
any friend of Stephanie's

09:09.090 --> 09:10.133
is a friend of mine and the--

09:10.175 --> 09:11.843
Okay, dad. Ha ha.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.513
Well, I can see

09:11.885 --> 09:14.513
my time is up.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.264
Mickey, can I

09:14.554 --> 09:16.264
get you anything?

09:16.306 --> 09:18.683
How about a note to get

09:16.306 --> 09:18.683
me out of gym tomorrow?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.938
I'm kidding!

09:20.560 --> 09:23.938
I write my own notes.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.107
[laughing]

09:27.150 --> 09:28.402
Really?

09:28.443 --> 09:30.028
Hey, dad, Mickey's

09:28.443 --> 09:30.028
in seventh grade.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.571
She showed me how

09:30.070 --> 09:31.571
to get free doughnuts

09:31.612 --> 09:33.948
from the teacher's lounge.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.159
Really?

09:36.201 --> 09:38.537
You guys wanna play

09:36.201 --> 09:38.537
a game with us upstairs?

09:38.578 --> 09:42.207
Michelle, we're in junior

09:38.578 --> 09:42.207
high. Give me a break.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.834
Yesterday, nobody

09:42.249 --> 09:44.834
would even talk to her.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.462
[chuckles nervously]

09:47.504 --> 09:51.132
So, dad, can Mickey

09:47.504 --> 09:51.132
stay for dinner?

09:51.174 --> 09:52.592
Well, sure.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.094
Oh, thanks,

09:52.633 --> 09:54.094
but it's my turn

09:54.135 --> 09:56.179
to make dinner

09:54.135 --> 09:56.179
for me and Janet.

09:56.221 --> 09:59.474
- Your sister?

09:56.221 --> 09:59.474
- My mother. See ya.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.726
- Bye, Mickey.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.726
- Bye-bye.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.148
So, uh...she calls

10:03.770 --> 10:07.148
her mother Janet?

10:07.190 --> 10:09.276
Yeah, isn't she cool, Danny?

10:11.819 --> 10:13.113
Dad.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.823
I don't know, uh,

10:14.322 --> 10:15.823
it seems to me that

10:15.865 --> 10:18.326
Mickey has a little

10:15.865 --> 10:18.326
bit of an edge, you know.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.413
An edge? Dad, you make her

10:18.368 --> 10:21.413
sound like she's a criminal.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.872
What? No. I didn't say that.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.292
But that's what you're

10:22.914 --> 10:25.292
thinking, aren't you?

10:25.333 --> 10:27.335
Great, I finally find

10:25.333 --> 10:27.335
a friend, and you hate her.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.836
- I don't hate her.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.836
- Well, you don't like her.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.255
- I don't even know her.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.255
- But you think you do.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.756
And you're wrong,

10:30.297 --> 10:31.756
whatever you think

10:31.798 --> 10:34.050
about her, you're wrong.

10:34.092 --> 10:37.137
[instrumental music]

10:42.058 --> 10:45.562
- Do you like this shade?

10:42.058 --> 10:45.562
- Sure, I use it all the time.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.315
[chuckles]

10:45.604 --> 10:48.315
It's for your lips.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.567
Oh, I know, I was just

10:48.356 --> 10:50.567
seeing if it was sharp.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.777
[laughing]

10:54.154 --> 10:55.905
So I said, that is the worst

10:55.947 --> 10:57.824
fake ID I ever saw.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.828
Uh, I'd better

11:00.243 --> 11:01.828
get going.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.789
Oh, hang out. Hey,

11:01.869 --> 11:04.789
guys, this is Stephanie.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.666
'This is Kelly, Gia, and Lisa.'

11:06.707 --> 11:08.709
- The guys.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.709
- That's funny.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.212
You don't look like

11:08.751 --> 11:11.212
guys to me. Ha ha ha.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.341
[Stephanie laughing]

11:16.176 --> 11:19.596
You guys check out the bod

11:16.176 --> 11:19.596
on that new math teacher

11:19.638 --> 11:21.598
Mr. Lucas? What a babe.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.476
It was the first time I've

11:21.640 --> 11:24.476
ever stayed awake in algebra.

11:35.694 --> 11:38.865
- Uh...I'd better not.

11:35.694 --> 11:38.865
- How come?

11:38.906 --> 11:42.118
I-I'm trying to quit.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.371
You should have seen

11:42.160 --> 11:44.371
my last chest x-ray.

11:45.746 --> 11:49.042
Sixth graders are

11:45.746 --> 11:49.042
terminally pathetic.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.835
[bell ringing]

11:50.877 --> 11:52.837
Uh-oh. There's the bell.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.837
We'd better get going.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.589
- 'Uh-oh!'

11:52.879 --> 11:54.589
- The bell!

11:54.631 --> 11:56.257
(all)

11:54.631 --> 11:56.257
Uh-oh!

11:56.299 --> 11:59.135
Hey, give her a break.

11:56.299 --> 11:59.135
She's a good kid.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.637
Oh, yeah?

12:00.679 --> 12:02.889
Then why don't you go

12:00.679 --> 12:02.889
be a good kid with her?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.103
Give me a light.

[instrumental music]

12:26.246 --> 12:28.248
Hi, Steph.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.248
Want to play cards?

12:30.791 --> 12:33.044
My life has come down to this.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.048
- Where's your new friend?

12:34.546 --> 12:37.048
- I don't know, Michelle.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.259
I know where my friends are.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.262
Denise is at home.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.262
Derek's at dance class.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.597
Russell's at Hebrew school.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.807
O-okay, Michelle. Just deal.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.184
Okay.

12:48.226 --> 12:51.271
Hold your breath

12:48.226 --> 12:51.271
and pick three cards.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.814
- What?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.814
- You breathed.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.234
Now you have to sing

12:53.856 --> 12:56.234
happy birthday to the king.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.321
Michelle, what are

12:57.985 --> 13:00.321
you talking about?

13:00.363 --> 13:02.323
This isn't even

13:00.363 --> 13:02.323
a real card game.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.242
You're making it up

13:02.365 --> 13:04.242
as you go along.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.953
So what? That's how we play.

13:08.246 --> 13:11.374
Fine. I capture

13:08.246 --> 13:11.374
your queen.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.918
Hey! You can't do that.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.754
That's cheating.

13:17.088 --> 13:19.424
How could I cheat?

13:17.088 --> 13:19.424
There are no rules.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.008
Cheater! Cheater! Cheater!

13:21.050 --> 13:22.969
This game is stupid,

13:21.050 --> 13:22.969
stupid, stupid.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.638
Hey! Hey! Hey!

13:24.679 --> 13:26.306
Hey! Hey! Stop it!

13:26.347 --> 13:28.558
Whoa! Whoa! Who-o-oa!

13:29.976 --> 13:31.894
Guys, the airport just called

13:31.936 --> 13:33.812
and complained about the noise.

13:33.854 --> 13:36.441
Dad, Michelle invented this

13:33.854 --> 13:36.441
stupid game with no rules--

13:36.483 --> 13:38.985
Honey, if it's a stupid game

13:36.483 --> 13:38.985
then why are you playing it?

13:39.026 --> 13:41.237
- And where's your new friend?

13:39.026 --> 13:41.237
- I don't know.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.948
Why does everyone have

13:41.279 --> 13:43.948
to pry into my personal life?

13:43.990 --> 13:48.119
Hey, I'm a dad. Prying is

13:43.990 --> 13:48.119
part of my job description.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.789
Forget it. I'm through

13:48.161 --> 13:50.789
playing with six-year-olds.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.168
Hey, Nicky, you

13:52.957 --> 13:55.168
done with the blue?

13:56.753 --> 13:59.547
Well, huh, stay

13:56.753 --> 13:59.547
inside the lines.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.430
Well, you stayed

14:05.261 --> 14:07.430
inside the page.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.937
Hey, guys...

14:11.850 --> 14:14.937
what do you think?

14:17.940 --> 14:21.486
- Pretty cool, huh?

14:17.940 --> 14:21.486
- Bad, Stephie.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.866
It's yucky.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.369
Pre-schoolers are

14:26.907 --> 14:29.369
terminally pathetic.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.373
Hi.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.877
Steph, thanks for

14:36.209 --> 14:37.877
watching the boys.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.713
It's so much easier going

14:37.918 --> 14:39.713
down the cookie aisle

14:39.754 --> 14:42.131
without four extra arms

14:39.754 --> 14:42.131
shooting out of the cart.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.467
Sure, I could

14:42.173 --> 14:44.467
watch 'em every day.

14:44.509 --> 14:45.593
Well, wouldn't

14:44.509 --> 14:45.593
you rather be with

14:45.635 --> 14:46.845
your new friend from school?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.763
Please, Aunt Becky,

14:46.886 --> 14:48.763
could you just

14:48.805 --> 14:51.474
not talk about

14:48.805 --> 14:51.474
friends or school?

14:51.516 --> 14:53.727
Oh, Steph.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.727
I remember junior high.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.395
It can be pretty tough.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.104
It was tough

14:55.436 --> 14:57.104
for you too?

14:57.146 --> 14:59.232
Oh, sure.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.941
I remember coming home crying

15:00.983 --> 15:03.653
when I came in second

15:00.983 --> 15:03.653
for winter princess.

15:04.863 --> 15:07.448
You actually

15:04.863 --> 15:07.448
cried over that?

15:07.490 --> 15:09.409
Well, yeah.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.244
Had to ride on

15:09.450 --> 15:11.244
the little float

15:11.285 --> 15:13.872
with only one

15:11.285 --> 15:13.872
snowflake attendant..

15:16.374 --> 15:18.292
Not a great example.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.588
But if there's something

15:19.753 --> 15:21.588
you want to talk about

15:21.629 --> 15:23.464
maybe I can help.

15:23.506 --> 15:27.719
Well...I

15:23.506 --> 15:27.719
don't think so.

15:27.761 --> 15:31.055
Well, if you ever do

15:27.761 --> 15:31.055
think so, I'm here for you.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.641
- Thanks, Aunt Becky.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.641
- You're welcome.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.061
- Thank you, mama.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.396
You're welcome too.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.775
[gasps]

15:38.438 --> 15:41.775
You little cookie monsters.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.027
'What did you do? What's that?'

15:46.112 --> 15:48.907
Thank you very much

15:46.112 --> 15:48.907
for the cookie.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.327
Alright, we'll be right back

15:50.491 --> 15:53.327
with "Yackin' With Youth."

15:53.369 --> 15:54.454
- "Teen Talk."

15:53.369 --> 15:54.454
- Ah!

15:54.495 --> 15:57.331
Beat you. We were off the air.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.083
You guys are acting

15:57.373 --> 15:59.083
like a couple of babies.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.585
You know what?

15:59.125 --> 16:00.585
D.J.'s right.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.128
Does it really matter

16:00.627 --> 16:02.128
what we call the show?

16:02.169 --> 16:03.296
- Of course not.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.296
- Good.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.338
Then "Yackin'

16:03.337 --> 16:04.338
With Youth" it is.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.506
- "Teen Talk."

16:04.380 --> 16:05.506
- Yack.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.550
- Talk. Talk!

16:05.548 --> 16:07.550
- Yack. Yack!

16:07.592 --> 16:08.802
You guys, cut it out.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.470
There's a very simple

16:08.843 --> 16:10.470
way to settle this.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.055
Yeah. Do what we do

16:10.511 --> 16:13.055
at the Gibbler house.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.975
Let's see, we'll need

16:13.097 --> 16:15.975
some masks, tights

16:16.016 --> 16:18.978
and a steel death cage.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.814
I-interesting plan,

16:19.019 --> 16:20.814
Kimmy, but I was thinking

16:20.855 --> 16:22.816
of an even

16:20.855 --> 16:22.816
simpler solution.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.024
We're all part

16:22.857 --> 16:24.024
of the show

16:24.066 --> 16:25.192
so why don't we just

16:24.066 --> 16:25.192
take a vote on it?

16:25.234 --> 16:26.611
Good idea.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.611
Very good, Steve.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.946
- And nice hair, by the way.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.946
- Thank you.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.949
Alright, all

16:27.987 --> 16:30.949
in favor of, uh

16:30.990 --> 16:33.660
"Yackin' With Youth"

16:30.990 --> 16:33.660
raise your hand.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.912
Thank you, Kimberly, I've

16:33.701 --> 16:35.912
always liked you since day one.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.915
Okay, all in

16:37.121 --> 16:38.915
favor of the subtle

16:38.957 --> 16:41.208
yet witty "Teen Talk"

16:38.957 --> 16:41.208
put 'em up.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.169
Thank you, Steven.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.964
So, it's 2-2, makes it a tie.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.964
It's up to you, D.J.

16:47.298 --> 16:48.758
Well, to tell

16:47.298 --> 16:48.758
you the truth

16:48.800 --> 16:50.969
I think both titles

16:48.800 --> 16:50.969
are kind of lame.

16:52.303 --> 16:54.555
- Lame?

16:52.303 --> 16:54.555
- Even mine?

16:56.056 --> 16:58.434
Uh, Bert, Ernie, your

16:56.056 --> 16:58.434
switchboard is lighting up.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.854
Oh, alright, alright.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.854
Hey, we're back.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.355
I guess you

17:00.895 --> 17:02.355
already knew that.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.774
Uh, our next caller

17:02.396 --> 17:04.774
is a girl named Olga.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.234
She's a junior high

17:04.816 --> 17:07.234
school student.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.903
Olga, go ahead.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.322
(Olga on phone)

17:08.945 --> 17:11.322
'Uh, I-I am junior high student'

17:11.364 --> 17:13.700
'uh, new to America.'

17:14.325 --> 17:15.827
M-my problem is

17:15.869 --> 17:18.496
a-a group of new friends

17:18.538 --> 17:22.458
uh, wants for me to, uh, smoke

17:22.500 --> 17:24.585
what you call, uh, cigarettes.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.797
Well, Olga, did you do it?

17:27.839 --> 17:30.049
(Stephanie on phone)

17:27.839 --> 17:30.049
'A-a-almost, but no.'

17:30.090 --> 17:31.634
Well, Olga, in-in our country

17:31.676 --> 17:34.679
"almost, but no"

17:31.676 --> 17:34.679
is, uh, thumbs upski.

17:35.972 --> 17:39.350
Thumbs upski for you

17:35.972 --> 17:39.350
maybe, Mr. Radioman

17:39.392 --> 17:42.478
but I want for

17:39.392 --> 17:42.478
this girl to like me.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.438
Well, I think that

17:44.480 --> 17:45.523
if you have to smoke

17:45.565 --> 17:46.566
in order to be her friend

17:46.607 --> 17:48.026
she's not a real friend.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.318
That's right,

17:48.067 --> 17:49.318
a true friend

17:49.360 --> 17:50.528
likes you

17:49.360 --> 17:50.528
for who you are

17:50.570 --> 17:52.739
and how much

17:50.570 --> 17:52.739
money you have.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.535
Uh, um, you know, from-from

17:54.657 --> 17:57.535
a guy's point of view, Olga

17:57.577 --> 18:00.955
kissing a girl who smokes

17:57.577 --> 18:00.955
is like kissing an ashtray.

18:00.997 --> 18:04.042
What ashtray have you

18:00.997 --> 18:04.042
been kissing lately?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.960
Uh, well, actually,

18:04.083 --> 18:05.960
my Aunt Ethel.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.879
You know, I-I love her and all,

18:06.002 --> 18:07.879
but she smokes so much

18:07.921 --> 18:09.797
her dalmatian

18:07.921 --> 18:09.797
is all black.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.092
You know, Olga, you

18:11.257 --> 18:13.092
sound like you have

18:13.133 --> 18:15.219
a really nice voice.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.219
You don't want to smoke.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.554
You'll sound like Yosemite Sam

18:16.596 --> 18:18.556
with a cactus

18:16.596 --> 18:18.556
caught in your throat.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.059
[imitating Yosemite Sam]

18:18.598 --> 18:21.059
Ooh, I hate that ra-ra..

18:21.100 --> 18:22.852
[coughing]

18:21.100 --> 18:22.852
...ra..

18:25.479 --> 18:28.107
Olga, what cartoon-breath

18:25.479 --> 18:28.107
is trying to say over here

18:28.148 --> 18:31.110
is that, uh, smoking is

18:28.148 --> 18:31.110
not cool, and that's that.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.153
You know, so, listen,

18:31.151 --> 18:33.153
stick to your guns

18:33.195 --> 18:36.198
and, most importantly,

18:33.195 --> 18:36.198
enjoy our country.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.159
Next up,

18:36.240 --> 18:39.159
The Beach Boys.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.622
See, guys, now does it really

18:39.201 --> 18:42.622
matter what you call the show?

18:42.663 --> 18:44.999
The important thing is that

18:42.663 --> 18:44.999
we helped someone out today.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.584
Yeah, you know,

18:45.041 --> 18:46.584
D.J.'s right.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.087
It was stupid getting into

18:46.626 --> 18:49.087
this whole competitive thing.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.631
Ah, it was just

18:49.128 --> 18:51.631
a thing we did..

18:51.672 --> 18:53.173
Sorry, pal.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.173
Sorry, you guys.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.051
You-you had to

18:53.215 --> 18:55.051
put up with a lot.

18:55.093 --> 18:58.262
You know what? After the show,

18:55.093 --> 18:58.262
I'm gonna buy you guys a pizza.

18:58.304 --> 19:02.224
You know what? After pizza,

18:58.304 --> 19:02.224
I'm gonna take you all bowling.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.184
Well, after bowling,

19:02.266 --> 19:04.184
then ice cream's on me.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.813
Ice cream, everyone.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.813
All the toppings you want.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.273
Well, then after that we're

19:06.854 --> 19:09.273
going shopping. Who needs socks?

19:09.315 --> 19:11.776
Socks? They don't need

19:09.315 --> 19:11.776
socks. I've got money.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.611
- I got cash.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.611
- I got Krugerrands.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.737
I've got, I've got..

19:17.991 --> 19:19.450
[knocking on door]

19:21.035 --> 19:22.703
Hey, Steph. How's it going?

19:22.745 --> 19:23.746
[imitating Olga]

19:22.745 --> 19:23.746
Is good.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.248
I mean, uh, fine.

19:26.290 --> 19:30.920
[imitating Olga]

19:26.290 --> 19:30.920
Olga. So it was you

19:26.290 --> 19:30.920
on the radio, huh?

19:32.338 --> 19:35.341
- You heard me?

19:32.338 --> 19:35.341
- Yeah.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.550
Steph, I'm glad I did.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.593
I knew something

19:36.592 --> 19:37.593
was bugging you

19:37.635 --> 19:39.178
but I didn't

19:37.635 --> 19:39.178
know what it was.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.805
Dad, I didn't want to tell you

19:40.847 --> 19:42.056
about this whole cigarette thing

19:42.098 --> 19:43.432
'cause I was afraid

19:43.474 --> 19:45.267
you'd be mad at me.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.145
Mad at you?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.647
Steph, I am proud of you.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.232
I know how hard it is

19:49.689 --> 19:52.232
to go against the crowd.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.526
Dad..

19:55.653 --> 19:58.364
...did kids ever try

19:55.653 --> 19:58.364
to get you to smoke?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.533
Well, yeah.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.535
But actually, you know,

20:00.574 --> 20:02.535
it never appealed to me.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.537
I always figured, if I wanted

20:02.576 --> 20:04.537
to fill my lungs with smoke

20:04.578 --> 20:07.081
I'd just stick my head in

20:04.578 --> 20:07.081
a barbecue pit, you know.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.503
But what am I gonna

20:10.334 --> 20:12.503
do about Mickey?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.672
I think I still

20:12.545 --> 20:14.672
want to be her friend.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.550
Well, you know

20:17.591 --> 20:20.094
you got to trust

20:17.591 --> 20:20.094
your instincts, honey.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.513
If you like Mickey a-and you

20:20.136 --> 20:22.513
think she's a good person

20:22.555 --> 20:24.598
then you should be her friend.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.850
But if you don't

20:24.640 --> 20:25.850
want to be her friend

20:25.892 --> 20:27.601
that's okay too, you know.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.355
But why does she have to smoke?

20:31.397 --> 20:34.108
Well, you know, it's

20:31.397 --> 20:34.108
possible she's feeling

20:34.150 --> 20:36.152
the same pressure

20:34.150 --> 20:36.152
that you are.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.571
She's just not strong

20:36.194 --> 20:38.571
enough to stand up to it.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.949
Maybe. But what do I do

20:38.612 --> 20:41.949
if I see her tomorrow?

20:41.991 --> 20:44.243
Do I tell her how I feel?

20:44.284 --> 20:47.621
Should I wait for

20:44.284 --> 20:47.621
her to talk to me?

20:47.663 --> 20:50.583
Maybe I'll just stay home

20:47.663 --> 20:50.583
and finish junior high by mail.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.588
Oh, Steph.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.588
You know what?

20:56.964 --> 20:58.507
You just hang in there.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.927
'Cause believe it or not,

20:58.549 --> 21:00.927
it gets easier.

21:04.471 --> 21:07.516
[girls laughing]

21:10.728 --> 21:11.854
[clears throat]

21:17.443 --> 21:21.072
So, they're letting

21:17.443 --> 21:21.072
you go to the bathroom

21:21.114 --> 21:24.075
all by yourself now?

21:24.117 --> 21:25.451
Yeah.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.745
When are you

21:25.492 --> 21:27.745
gonna start?

21:29.455 --> 21:30.706
Ooh!

21:30.748 --> 21:33.209
Little Miss Bigmouth

21:30.748 --> 21:33.209
got me good.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.544
You want a smoke?

21:35.586 --> 21:38.672
[scoffs]

21:35.586 --> 21:38.672
Oh, that's right.

21:35.586 --> 21:38.672
You quit.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.091
[girls laughing]

21:40.133 --> 21:42.718
Yeah. I guess I'm just

21:40.133 --> 21:42.718
a big fan of breathing.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.512
[Mickey laughing]

21:45.554 --> 21:48.557
- What are you laughing at?

21:45.554 --> 21:48.557
- That was funny.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.517
If something is funny, I laugh.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.436
Yeah. If something's

21:50.559 --> 21:52.436
funny, she laughs.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.855
Shut up.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.357
Sixth graders

21:54.897 --> 21:57.357
are a waste of skin.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.944
You should know. You were

21:57.399 --> 21:59.944
there for three years.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.616
It was two. So, ha!

22:07.827 --> 22:10.121
Come on, Mickey.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.121
Walk me to detention.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.544
Mickey, you

22:15.375 --> 22:17.544
coming or what?

22:17.586 --> 22:19.797
No, you guys go.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.797
I'm gonna hang out here.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.381
With this scrub?

22:21.423 --> 22:24.802
If she wants to hang out

22:21.423 --> 22:24.802
with a scrub, she can.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.305
Not that there is one in

22:24.844 --> 22:27.305
here, but if there were--

22:27.345 --> 22:29.723
They got the point.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.976
Come on. Let's get out of here.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.978
[bell ringing]

22:34.020 --> 22:36.981
Well, uh, guess

22:34.020 --> 22:36.981
I'd better go.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.733
- Yeah, okay. See ya.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.733
- See ya.

22:44.571 --> 22:47.158
Wait, Steph.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.328
You want to do

22:47.200 --> 22:50.328
something after school?

22:50.368 --> 22:53.039
Well, I do, but my lungs don't.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.251
Oh, the smokes.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.503
I've been thinking

22:57.293 --> 22:59.503
of cutting down.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.299
Great.

23:03.341 --> 23:05.509
Did you see what Mr. Lucas

23:03.341 --> 23:05.509
was wearing today?

23:05.551 --> 23:07.427
Brand-new Dockers.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.427
He's so cute.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.679
