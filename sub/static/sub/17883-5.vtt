Happy Monday, professionals.

00:21.421 --> 00:23.922
It's Thursday,
and so it begins.

00:23.923 --> 00:27.393
Hello, boss. Right.
We have a lot going on today.

00:27.394 --> 00:28.894
You know it, <i>girlfriend.</i>

00:28.895 --> 00:31.680
Oh, I am obsessed with this new
phone that you set me up with.

00:31.731 --> 00:33.696
If I could just get
your focus for a moment,

00:33.733 --> 00:35.017
this is today's schedule...

00:35.018 --> 00:36.235
It's even got auto-tune,

00:36.319 --> 00:38.020
so everything you say
sounds like a rap song,

00:38.021 --> 00:40.072
even words like...

Birthday? Whose is it?

00:54.237 --> 00:55.454
Mine, next week.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.406
I've prepurchased
a card for myself

00:57.407 --> 01:00.292
to avoid the usual awkwardness
when you inevitably forget.

01:00.293 --> 01:01.677
I thought it might be
to your taste.

01:01.678 --> 01:03.295

Cash!
Yeah.

01:36.296 --> 01:38.914
It's 14 feet. Could you not
have just walked them over?

01:38.965 --> 01:40.782
Since when are you guys
hitting on Molly?

01:40.783 --> 01:42.451
She may have a stick
up her butt,

01:42.452 --> 01:44.253

02:38.108 --> 02:41.560

creamy deliciousness...

02:45.681 --> 02:47.483
Uh-huh.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.518
I think
I'm figuring this out.

02:49.519 --> 02:51.750
When was the last time
you got some?

02:51.788 --> 02:52.871
Pardon?

02:52.872 --> 02:54.689
You know.
Spelunked mount baldy?

02:54.690 --> 02:57.709
Rode the pink twinkler?
Shanghaied the pumpkin patch?

02:57.794 --> 03:00.009
Parked the plunger?
Vacuumed the volcano?

03:00.029 --> 03:01.969
Scrambled a vaj-omelet?

03:02.031 --> 03:04.466
Wait a second.

03:04.467 --> 03:05.639
You.

03:05.668 --> 03:08.726
You ate my pudding.

03:08.755 --> 03:09.972
<i>What?</i>

03:09.973 --> 03:11.395
Give me the room.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.675
We're not really in a room.

03:13.676 --> 03:15.441
It's more of
a communal work area.

03:15.512 --> 03:18.402
Give... me... the... room!

03:21.651 --> 03:24.570
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

03:24.571 --> 03:26.035
Did you...

03:26.072 --> 03:27.722
Or did you not...

03:27.723 --> 03:29.441
Eat my pudding?

03:29.442 --> 03:33.529
Perhaps, to keep both the peace
and Veronica on schedule,

03:33.530 --> 03:36.415
may I nip out and just
get oz another pudding?

03:36.416 --> 03:39.234
No. No nipping out
to get <i>oz</i> something.

You're <i>my</i> girl,
you work for me,

03:41.337 --> 03:44.178
and it just so happens that
I have a very important meeting

03:44.240 --> 03:46.575
that consists of... oh.

03:46.576 --> 03:48.594
We're putting that
on the schedule now?

03:48.595 --> 03:49.600
Mm-hmm.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.513
I don't really have to go.

03:51.514 --> 03:53.348
Wait.

03:53.349 --> 03:55.551
Oh, yeah, maybe.

04:00.756 --> 04:04.109
Veronica stole my pudding.
I'm going to steal hers.

04:04.194 --> 04:06.895
Molly Marie Hughes...
That is our target, gentlemen.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.930
Don't you think
you're overreacting?

04:08.931 --> 04:11.066
Even if V. Did steal
your pudding, who cares?

04:12.435 --> 04:14.036
No...
<i>I</i> care!

04:14.037 --> 04:16.538
Damn it, I was going to court
to fight a ticket.

04:16.606 --> 04:19.825
Veronica's already taken
my office, my company...

04:19.826 --> 04:21.459
That's just the beginning.

04:21.461 --> 04:22.944
Hey, uh...

04:22.945 --> 04:25.719
Veronica. Read the sign.
You're in my spot.

04:25.748 --> 04:27.466
Oh, shoot.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.918
I already put it in park,
and I already took the key out,

04:29.919 --> 04:32.221
and I already put 'em
in my purse, and...

04:32.222 --> 04:36.981
Oh, no. I closed the door,
and now I'm going inside.

04:37.043 --> 04:40.812
All that woman does
is <i>take-y, take-y.</i>

04:40.813 --> 04:41.847
Well, now it's my turn.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.148
We're gonna take Molly

04:43.149 --> 04:45.484
with a little high-level
C.I.A. Deprogramming.

04:45.485 --> 04:46.818
Were you in the C.I.A.?

04:46.903 --> 04:49.688
Nope, and as soon as
we're done with Molly,

04:49.689 --> 04:52.474
she'll forget
Veronica mann ever existed...

05:09.825 --> 05:11.660
So it's... it's beep...

05:16.349 --> 05:17.646
Would you like a spot of tea?

05:17.684 --> 05:20.852
Big Ben? Parliament? Guv'nor?

05:32.282 --> 05:34.700
You know, there are
some people in this office

05:34.701 --> 05:36.401
who do appreciate you.

05:36.402 --> 05:39.738
Why don't you take
a little break? Hmm?

05:39.739 --> 05:42.040
Come on.

This is an emergency!

<i>Emergency. Now dialing police.</i>

06:09.018 --> 06:12.387
No! Don't call the po-po!

Ain't it a drag when
you're looking for something,

06:17.076 --> 06:19.375
and it's just not there?

06:19.412 --> 06:22.497
Kind of like my pudding. Mm?

06:22.498 --> 06:24.750
Mmm.

06:24.751 --> 06:27.674
Creamy deliciousness.

06:27.737 --> 06:29.237

So good.

07:42.916 --> 07:44.917
Probably requesting

08:04.304 --> 08:06.227
Hmm. Please. Be seated.

08:06.256 --> 08:08.424
O.C.P. Policy disallows

08:08.475 --> 08:11.227

Ah, yes.
That's more like it.

08:21.705 --> 08:24.457
Is he some pale, brooding emo
that hangs out at high school...

08:24.458 --> 08:26.956
Even though
he's, like, 110 years old?

08:26.994 --> 08:29.211
No, but...

So he's a werewolf.

08:32.666 --> 08:34.417

Yeah, being a professional
hacker is crazy dangerous,

Nice job. Now she's gone.

11:01.565 --> 11:03.654
You look like you've had
about a dozen too many.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.618
Why don't you let me
take you home? Huh?

11:05.619 --> 11:07.903
Um, oh, okay. Thank you.

11:07.904 --> 11:09.905
- To be safe.
- Whoop.

11:09.906 --> 11:10.939
Watch your head.

11:16.329 --> 11:19.781
So...
My dear, where am I going?

11:19.782 --> 11:21.667
Uh, Los Santos.

11:21.668 --> 11:23.452
It's been quite a night.

11:23.453 --> 11:25.721
Everyone was acting
a little loony.

11:25.788 --> 11:27.306
Yeah,
nothing wrong with loony.

11:27.307 --> 11:29.475
You don't want to play it safe
your entire life, do you?

11:29.476 --> 11:31.393
No. I don't.

11:33.180 --> 11:35.264
uh...
What was that?

11:35.265 --> 11:36.965
What was what?

11:37.017 --> 11:39.401
I think
you just kissed my eye.

11:39.469 --> 11:41.470
No... no... no... I d...
I'm gonna get a cab.

11:41.471 --> 11:42.818
I'm so sorry.

11:42.856 --> 11:44.356
Um, see you...
See you tomorrow!

11:52.524 --> 11:54.175
Oz, what happened last night?

11:54.176 --> 11:56.311
Yeah, we saw the whole thing.
You laid one on Molly.

11:56.378 --> 11:58.096
Look, I don't kiss and tell,

11:58.097 --> 12:01.015
but I'm telling you,
the girl kissed me.

12:01.016 --> 12:02.850
Forbidden love.
Oh! Ah!

12:02.851 --> 12:04.852
Mm? Yeah.

12:04.904 --> 12:06.721
Take that off!

12:06.722 --> 12:08.856
Later! Not now!

12:08.857 --> 12:11.859
And you guys, drop it.
All right? She was drunk.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.361
I guarantee you
she wakes up this morning,

12:13.362 --> 12:14.579
wishing last night
never happened.

12:15.897 --> 12:17.591
Ah.

12:17.592 --> 12:18.778
See?

12:20.619 --> 12:22.370
"Sorry about last night."

12:23.422 --> 12:24.455
Oh.

12:24.456 --> 12:26.007
"I shouldn't have run off

12:26.008 --> 12:28.760
right when things were getting
good. Double winky face."

12:28.761 --> 12:29.910
"Double winky face"?

12:29.962 --> 12:31.379
"Double <i>winky"?</i>

12:31.380 --> 12:33.414
"Double winky face."
Oh, dear God.

12:39.047 --> 12:42.590
I'm sorry. I just wanted
some sweet pudding revenge.

12:42.591 --> 12:44.559
Molly's crush was merely
collateral damage.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.761
What did you expect?
You're very tappable.

12:46.762 --> 12:48.730
All right.
Keep it in your pants, V.

12:48.781 --> 12:51.065
Listen, I want Molly back,

12:51.066 --> 12:54.035
so pull her aside
and set her straight right now.

12:54.036 --> 12:55.620
It's not gonna be easy.

12:55.621 --> 12:57.455
I mean, historically,
people don't respond well

12:57.456 --> 12:59.624
when the old oz-man
gives 'em the heave-ho.

12:59.625 --> 13:00.858
Don't jump!

13:00.859 --> 13:03.461
But I'll never meet
anyone as great as oz!

13:03.529 --> 13:05.112
You dated oz?

13:05.113 --> 13:07.248
We're gonna need a net.

13:07.249 --> 13:09.884
Trust me, it's better if she's
the one who breaks it off.

13:09.885 --> 13:11.285
I'm gonna call in the experts.

13:11.286 --> 13:13.488
Experts at what?

13:13.555 --> 13:15.123
Repelling women.

13:15.124 --> 13:16.390
You wanted
to see us, oz?

13:16.391 --> 13:18.443
Ebony. Ivory. Yes.

13:18.444 --> 13:20.244
Operation cyrano
is in full effect.

13:20.245 --> 13:21.913
Cash, you're gonna be
my lead on this mission.

13:21.914 --> 13:23.364
Oh! Suck it!

13:23.365 --> 13:26.768
Our target is
one Molly Hughes.

13:26.769 --> 13:28.803
Uh, you know,
she's right over there.

13:28.804 --> 13:30.406
I don't think
we need the photo.

13:30.407 --> 13:32.323
- Zip it. Yeah.
- Got it.

13:32.324 --> 13:34.409
<i>You</i> are going to be
my eyes and ears on this one.

13:34.410 --> 13:36.361
You're gonna tell me what to do,
what to say, and what to wear.

13:36.362 --> 13:38.246
Nice! Then what?

13:38.247 --> 13:40.314
Well, if your track record
is any indication,

13:40.315 --> 13:42.583
she'll be completely repulsed
and want nothing to do with me.

13:42.584 --> 13:45.003
- Problem solved.
- That just... that cuts me deep.

13:45.004 --> 13:47.505
I mean, yeah, sure, I'm on
an all-male Quidditch team,

13:47.506 --> 13:51.009
and yeah, my wardrobe is mostly
capes, and yeah, it's true,

13:51.010 --> 13:53.094
I write erotic "quantum leap"
fan fiction, but you know what?

13:53.161 --> 13:54.612
One day I'm gonna find a girl,

13:54.613 --> 13:56.664
and she's gonna
appreciate me for me.

13:56.665 --> 13:58.933
You're cyrano de nerdgerac.
<i>You</i> suck it.

13:58.934 --> 14:02.103
Hey. Easy, champ. You have
a much more important job.

14:02.104 --> 14:05.640
<i>You</i> have to babysit Veronica.

14:05.691 --> 14:07.475
Oh, my God.
It's so cute in here, you guys.

14:07.476 --> 14:10.194
Look at all these little buttons
and switches and toggles.

14:10.195 --> 14:12.141
- What's this one?
- No.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.398
Oops.

14:13.399 --> 14:16.034
Dude, really?
You have one job.

14:16.035 --> 14:17.852
Veronica,
don't you want your assistant back?

14:17.853 --> 14:19.203
Yes.
Okay.

14:19.204 --> 14:21.039
(Electronic beeping
and whirring) Wow.

14:21.040 --> 14:24.709
Not quite what I expected,
but... it's quaint.

14:24.710 --> 14:28.746
Gamer cafe...
My home away from the office.

14:28.747 --> 14:31.049
I wanted to share
this magical place with you.

14:31.050 --> 14:33.051
Oh. Well, thank you.

14:33.135 --> 14:35.136
Okay. Here we go.

14:35.137 --> 14:37.255
Order some jalapeã±o poppers
and a drink.

14:37.256 --> 14:40.174
Garcon? Can I order some,
uh, jalapeã±o poppers?

14:40.175 --> 14:42.209
And, uh, I'd love to see
the wine list, if I may.

14:42.210 --> 14:44.062
No, no, no, no.
Do not improvise.

14:44.063 --> 14:45.897
No wine list.
Order a suicide.

14:45.898 --> 14:48.232
Uh, you know what? Make that
just a couple of suicides.

14:48.233 --> 14:49.367
Thank you.

14:49.435 --> 14:50.601
What's a suicide?

14:50.602 --> 14:52.437
A combination of
every soda in one cup.

14:52.438 --> 14:54.021
- Ohh.
- It's the nectar of the geeks.

14:54.022 --> 14:55.476
Gnarly.
Yeah.

14:58.226 --> 14:59.994
Conversation starter.

14:59.995 --> 15:02.830
Repeat word for word what I say,
exactly.

15:02.898 --> 15:04.615
If superman...

15:04.616 --> 15:08.235
And wonder woman had a baby,
w-what would its superpower be?

15:08.236 --> 15:10.037
Well, um...
That's a fun question.

15:10.038 --> 15:12.090
Um...

15:12.091 --> 15:13.324
I guess...

15:13.325 --> 15:15.009
Invisibility?

15:15.010 --> 15:16.243
Invisibility?
That makes no sense.

15:16.244 --> 15:17.762
Neither one of them
had that...

15:17.763 --> 15:21.099
Superpower. I mean, maybe if
superman made love to her jet...

15:21.100 --> 15:22.800
Guys. She's not buying that.

15:22.801 --> 15:25.019
Veronica, please.
Just let the man work his magic.

15:25.020 --> 15:27.138
Ooh. That's a great call.
Magic.

15:27.139 --> 15:29.640
Oz, do some magic.
Chicks hate it.

15:29.641 --> 15:31.275
Hey, uh, you got something
behind your ear there.

15:31.276 --> 15:33.594
See? Ohh.

15:33.595 --> 15:35.062
A rose for the lady.
Oh.

15:35.063 --> 15:37.281
No! Not a rose!
Do a card trick involving math.

15:37.366 --> 15:38.983
How did he even do that?

15:38.984 --> 15:43.070
You guys, I am getting really
worried. The man is too <i>smooth.</i>

15:43.071 --> 15:44.789
No, no, no, no.
Cash can do this.

15:44.790 --> 15:46.941
He's been turning off women
his whole life.

15:46.942 --> 15:49.109
Thanks for believing
in me, bro.

15:49.110 --> 15:51.162
Here we go. Strap in, oz.

15:51.163 --> 15:54.715
I have a, uh, dope collection
of "garbage pail kids."

15:54.716 --> 15:56.951
Then I hit him with a left
and an uppercut and a body blow,

15:56.952 --> 16:00.471
and that's how you beat
"Mike Tyson's punch-out!!"

16:00.556 --> 16:02.807
First boner... Jessica rabbit.

16:02.808 --> 16:05.977
I'm building a bunker in
the event of an ape robot war.

16:05.978 --> 16:10.398
Three words...
"Chronicles of riddick."

16:12.818 --> 16:14.101
Yes.

16:14.153 --> 16:16.437
This makes no sense.

16:16.438 --> 16:19.306
I mean, this is my "a" game,
and it's like she likes... <i>Me.</i>

16:19.358 --> 16:21.359
<i>You have an...</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

16:21.360 --> 16:22.827
What? She's moving in! Quick!

16:22.828 --> 16:24.829
Uh, tell her you're gay!
Tell her you punched a baby!

16:24.830 --> 16:27.331
Tell her she's got a muffin top.
That'll work. That'll work!

16:27.332 --> 16:29.333
No! No, no, no.
She likes me.

16:29.334 --> 16:30.835
This is the best date
I've ever had.

16:30.836 --> 16:32.653
It's not a date.
It's a mission.

16:32.654 --> 16:34.539
Okay. Change of plans.
Go! Go! Go! Go!

16:34.540 --> 16:36.657
No. Wait. She's going rogue!
She's going rogue!

16:36.658 --> 16:38.659
I've never met anyone
like you before.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.678
You're just so full of...

16:40.762 --> 16:42.847
Surprises.

16:42.848 --> 16:45.600
What?! Cameron!
Why, look who's here.

16:45.601 --> 16:49.169
It is two of our fellow
co-workers... oswald and Molly.

16:49.170 --> 16:53.357
Cam, did I not give you a very,
very important job to do?

16:53.442 --> 16:54.859
W-what's going on here?

16:54.860 --> 16:57.111
Oh, nothin'.

16:57.112 --> 17:00.848
You know, just taking my new
assistant here out. Yeah.

17:00.849 --> 17:02.366
He's the greatest.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.117
Right?
Thank you. Yep.

17:04.118 --> 17:06.204
Why... why is everyone
crashing our date?

17:06.288 --> 17:08.713
I gotta be honest with you.

17:10.125 --> 17:12.210
It's not a date.

17:12.211 --> 17:13.461
Pardon me?

17:13.528 --> 17:15.496
Or is it?

17:15.547 --> 17:17.531
Pick a card.

17:17.531 --> 17:21.669
Molly, please don't shoot
the messenger, but the reason

17:21.670 --> 17:25.873
that these <i>abject morons</i> have
been being so nice to you lately

17:25.874 --> 17:27.962
is to make me look bad.

17:29.061 --> 17:30.194
Really?

17:33.815 --> 17:36.884
Well...

17:36.885 --> 17:38.236
I quit.

17:38.237 --> 17:39.403
Wait.

17:41.907 --> 17:45.826
Oh, and by the way, oz,
Veronica ate your pudding.

17:45.827 --> 17:48.312
Ha ha!

17:51.654 --> 17:54.739
So I got word
that you're quitting.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.293
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
conduct an exit interview.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.467
How was your date?

17:59.495 --> 18:01.829
How was my date?

18:03.198 --> 18:05.932
I was completely
and utterly humiliated.

18:05.968 --> 18:07.702
So you got <i>laid.</i>

18:07.703 --> 18:08.977
Nice.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.822
No, I didn't get laid.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.274
You know, I am really
starting to regret

18:13.275 --> 18:15.043
that I stole your pudding.

18:16.378 --> 18:18.429
I might have
overreacted a little.

18:18.430 --> 18:22.317
I mean, I did sort of bring
a chain saw to a pillow fight.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.285
Well...

18:24.286 --> 18:26.187
There goes the best darn
assistant <i>i'll</i> ever have.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.522
Eh, don't worry about it.

18:27.573 --> 18:29.557
You'll find somebody else
to run your life.

18:29.558 --> 18:33.861
You know, she wasn't
<i>just</i> my assistant, oswald.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.997
She was my friend.

18:36.064 --> 18:37.749
Really?
Yeah.

18:37.833 --> 18:39.117
I mean, the whole reason
I'm so hard on her

18:39.118 --> 18:40.501
is to toughen her up.

18:40.569 --> 18:43.070
You know,
my fondest wish

18:43.071 --> 18:45.906
was that one day
she'd stab me in the back

18:45.907 --> 18:50.378
and rip this job
from my cold, dead hands.

18:52.631 --> 18:56.351
You want to know the real reason
she took a shine to me?

18:56.418 --> 19:00.021
I showed her just
a little bit of kindness.

19:00.088 --> 19:02.023
You got about 30 seconds
to do the same.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.479
Molly, stop packing.
You're not quitting!

19:08.480 --> 19:10.315
Actually, I already have,

19:10.316 --> 19:11.449
and since you're not
my boss anymore,

19:11.450 --> 19:13.701
I'd like to give you
a piece of my mind.

19:13.702 --> 19:17.055
You... are... a poop head!

19:19.408 --> 19:22.634
And please, may I use
your name as a reference?

19:22.678 --> 19:24.445
