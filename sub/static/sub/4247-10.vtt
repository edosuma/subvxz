WEBVTT

00:00.767 --> 00:03.102
(sally)
my entire life for one thing--

00:03.104 --> 00:07.206
And you steal it from me.
(daniel) it's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.640
You wait until I'm standing
at the finish line.

00:08.642 --> 00:14.113
And you betray me!
You betray me.
James novak isn't gonna
say anything, sally.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.414
I talked to him.
He promised--
you betray me!

00:15.416 --> 00:17.649
Our family,
our marriage bed, my future--

00:17.651 --> 00:20.252
You snatch the one thing
that I care about.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.287
You steal my future
from me!
Our future, sally!

00:22.289 --> 00:23.389
Our future,
and I didn't steal it.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.357
I'm telling you,
nobody knows,

00:25.359 --> 00:27.092
Nobody's gonna know.
We're fine. We're fine.

00:27.094 --> 00:28.794
Cyrus beene knows.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.095
You said yourself
he's not gonna say anything.

00:30.097 --> 00:34.233
Yes. You fool.
It is his husband.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.201
You screwed his husband.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.170
That was poison fruit!

00:38.172 --> 00:40.072
And he will not rest
until he has vengeance.

00:40.074 --> 00:44.343
You have unleashed a snake
into our garden.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.211
You have spat in the face
of my hard work.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.313
You have sullied my soul
with your perversion,

00:48.315 --> 00:51.116
Your sickness,
your disgusting need--
come on, sally!

00:51.118 --> 00:52.384
You have a right
to be angry,

00:52.386 --> 00:54.319
But do not play
the righteous victim.

00:54.321 --> 00:55.454
Don't act like you didn't know
what you were getting into

00:55.456 --> 00:56.555
When you married me.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.090
I most certainly
did not know.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.225
If I had known,
if I had ever dreamed, dear god!

01:00.227 --> 01:02.594
You knew. You knew all the way
back in college

01:02.596 --> 01:04.363
When you saw me with that boy
from across the way.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.065
I do not know
<i>what</i> you are talking about!

01:06.067 --> 01:08.400
You knew and you didn't care
because you were shrill sally,

01:08.402 --> 01:10.335
The girl no one wanted,
the rich debutante

01:10.337 --> 01:11.570
Who couldn't find a husband.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.805
You didn't care because

01:12.807 --> 01:14.473
You needed a handsome man
on your arm.

01:14.475 --> 01:17.076
You needed someone who could
put up with your aspirations,

01:17.078 --> 01:19.144
And I needed my family
not to disown me.

01:19.146 --> 01:20.813
So I sold my soul to you.

01:20.815 --> 01:23.382
And I propped you up
and I played second fiddle,

01:23.384 --> 01:26.118
And I smiled at every dinner
and rally and fish fry,

01:26.120 --> 01:27.152
And look where I got you!

01:27.154 --> 01:30.856
(exhales sharply)

01:30.858 --> 01:32.124
Where you got me?

01:32.126 --> 01:33.625
You think you got me here?

01:33.627 --> 01:38.664
Sweetheart, <i>you</i> are the burden
that I carry on my back

01:38.666 --> 01:42.334
As I make my way to salvation.
<i>You</i> are my cross to bear.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.169
<i>You</i> are my original sin.

01:44.171 --> 01:47.573
You are pretty, and stupid,
and you can't make a living

01:47.575 --> 01:48.874
To save your life.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.443
What you've given me
is our daughter,

01:51.445 --> 01:53.178
Who can't
keep her knees together.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.646
I suffer you!

01:54.648 --> 01:56.415
I got myself here.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.485
And I am taking myself
to the promised land.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.487
I cannot wait until you
meet your maker.

02:01.489 --> 02:06.125
I cannot wait until you
are charged for your lies!

02:12.432 --> 02:14.199
I'm done.

02:14.201 --> 02:17.369
What?

02:17.371 --> 02:19.238
What the hell do you mean,
you're done?

02:19.240 --> 02:21.807
I got the one thing
that you can't buy, sally.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.176
A very essential possession
if you're ever gonna be

02:24.178 --> 02:26.378
President
of the United States--

02:26.380 --> 02:29.448
A set of balls.
I got 'em. You don't.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.816
So I'm done.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.885
Maybe I'll find a nice boy
somewhere and settle down.

02:32.887 --> 02:35.854
And tell them
the sally langston story.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.656
Who knows? Stay tuned.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.791
Daniel douglas--
good-bye, sally.

02:43.396 --> 02:45.164
Daniel!
(thwack)

02:47.200 --> 02:49.535
Daniel!
(gasps)

02:49.537 --> 02:53.739
(grunts)
(thud)

02:53.741 --> 02:56.241
(groans)
(clatter)

02:56.243 --> 02:57.209
(gasps)

03:00.380 --> 03:03.448
(line ringing)

03:06.653 --> 03:12.357
(ring)

03:12.359 --> 03:15.394
(ring)

03:15.396 --> 03:17.496
Cyrus.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.199
I have committed a sin.

03:20.201 --> 03:29.875
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

03:29.877 --> 03:32.311
(car door closes)

03:33.413 --> 03:35.914
(man) sir.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.283
Gentleman, good evening.

03:38.285 --> 03:40.385
(door creaks)

03:47.794 --> 03:49.962
What are we to do, cyrus?
What are we to do?

03:49.964 --> 03:52.264
We had a fight,
and the devil came in.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.366
The devil came in,
the devil came in.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.869
He made me. I did this.
I gave into him.

03:57.871 --> 04:01.240
I lost myself and now
I'm gonna burn in flames.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.508
(speaking inaudibly)

04:03.510 --> 04:04.776
<i>(cyrus) she's not his type.</i>

04:04.778 --> 04:07.980
I'm a sinner, cyrus.
I killed daniel douglas.

04:07.982 --> 04:12.017
<i>Daniel douglas will</i>
<i>make a pass at my husband.</i>

04:12.019 --> 04:13.485
<i>My husband will refuse</i>
<i>said pass,</i>

04:13.487 --> 04:15.287
<i>Slap his closeted face--</i>

04:15.289 --> 04:16.888
I judged him when only god
can judge him.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.023
Now I am condemned.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.925
<i>(james) you took photos?</i>

04:19.927 --> 04:21.360
<i>You think I would go through</i>
<i>with all this?!</i>

04:21.362 --> 04:22.527
<i>And not get proof?!</i>

04:22.529 --> 04:24.463
I'm a murderer.
I'm a sinner.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.664
<i>Go ahead.</i>

04:25.666 --> 04:26.999
<i>Take a gander.</i>

04:27.001 --> 04:32.904
<i>Because I trusted you!</i>
<i>You're the devil.</i>

04:32.906 --> 04:34.539
<i>That you'd honor our marriage.</i>
<i>The devil is in front of me!</i>

04:36.876 --> 04:38.443
(coughs and spits)

04:38.445 --> 04:40.979
(toilet flushes)

04:40.981 --> 04:42.981
(water running)

04:42.983 --> 04:44.850
(water drains)

04:44.852 --> 04:49.021
(inhales sharply,
exhales deeply)

04:49.023 --> 04:50.689
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)

04:50.691 --> 04:52.024
Get me everything you can
on marie wallace.

04:52.026 --> 04:53.525
If she's on
the fbi's most wanted list,

04:53.527 --> 04:54.693
There must be a file.
Liv--

04:54.695 --> 04:55.794
My mother's plane lands

04:55.796 --> 04:57.062
In hong kong
in less than 12 hours.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.664
If I'm going to have
her arrested when she lands,

04:58.666 --> 05:00.032
I need to know exactly
what she's guilty of.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.501
So, go. Now.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.869
(door opens)

05:04.971 --> 05:06.905
Where the hell is quinn?
(door closes)

05:06.907 --> 05:08.040
She's at b613.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.908
She's alive. Still moving.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.910
You put a tracking device
on her?

05:11.912 --> 05:15.947
(screaming)

05:15.949 --> 05:19.384
I put a tracking chip
where your tooth should be.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.053
In case you decide
you wanna run.

05:21.055 --> 05:23.855
I won't. I promise.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.057
I can do this.

05:28.594 --> 05:30.929
Well...

05:30.931 --> 05:32.864
Do we have a deal?

05:37.570 --> 05:39.771
Yes.

05:39.773 --> 05:40.939
We have a deal.

05:44.043 --> 05:46.078
(door closes)
found her, sir.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.113
Just took off from
a small airstrip near manassas.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.082
Your information
is no longer of value.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.917
I'll have to hold
onto this.
But, sir--

05:51.919 --> 05:53.452
Get me centcom.

05:55.722 --> 05:58.523
You snooze, you lose.
But, hey. Upside?

05:58.525 --> 06:00.025
You're still breathing.
He didn't make me kill you.

06:08.968 --> 06:11.470
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)

06:21.080 --> 06:23.148
(water splashes)

06:30.456 --> 06:31.990
(grunts)

06:38.564 --> 06:41.066
(groaning)

06:41.068 --> 06:44.136
(panting)

06:47.874 --> 06:49.608
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)

06:49.610 --> 06:51.877
(groaning)

06:51.879 --> 06:54.880
(panting)

06:54.882 --> 06:56.681
(water splashes)

06:59.652 --> 07:01.086
(projector and camera shutter
click)

07:01.088 --> 07:03.688
Quinn's gone.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.058
What do you mean, "gone"?

07:07.060 --> 07:08.427
Gone, dead gone?

07:08.429 --> 07:09.795
I don't know.
The chip turned off.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.463
She's just... Gone.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.765
And she won't reach out to us
even if she needs our help

07:13.767 --> 07:16.001
Because you what?
Tortured her?

07:16.003 --> 07:18.203
I followed
interrogation protocol.
You hurt her.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.538
I did my job.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.672
You hurt quinn.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.973
I had to make her
tell the truth.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.676
She was working for your father.
She betrayed us.

07:24.678 --> 07:25.977
She went off with charlie,

07:25.979 --> 07:28.513
And I had to make her
tell the truth.

07:28.515 --> 07:32.451
Take huck with you.
Keep an eye on him.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.885
Where's my line with centcom?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.020
Patching you through now,
sir.

07:35.022 --> 07:40.025
(cell phone ringing)

07:40.027 --> 07:41.193
(tires screech)

07:41.195 --> 07:43.762
Back up! Back up! Back up!
What the hell?

07:43.764 --> 07:46.465
(tires screech)

07:49.068 --> 07:52.137
(chains rattling)

07:57.777 --> 07:59.578
What is this?

07:59.580 --> 08:03.982
This is where you're staying
until maya pope's plane lands,

08:03.984 --> 08:07.486
Until she's free,
until she's hidden so well...

08:07.488 --> 08:09.821
(chair thuds)
you'll never find her.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.057
Have some free time
on our hands.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.860
I thought we could have
a little talk.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.900
This is what
I don't understand.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.636
If you already
had her in custody?

08:24.638 --> 08:27.639
And it's above your pay grade,
mr. President.

08:27.641 --> 08:32.777
(chuckles) here's the thing
about power, rowan.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.846
It's always hard to accept
when you've lost it.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.948
Or to realize you never
had any at all.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.783
Why shoot down that plane?

08:38.785 --> 08:41.653
Why keep olivia's mother
in prison for 22 years?

08:41.655 --> 08:46.024
And why let liv think her mother
was dead all this time?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.692
That's a matter
of national security,

08:47.694 --> 08:49.294
And it's above your pay grade,
mr. President.

08:50.963 --> 08:51.963
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

08:55.968 --> 08:58.803
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

08:58.805 --> 09:01.640
Uh, the--
we have a client.

09:01.642 --> 09:02.807
A client?

09:02.809 --> 09:04.910
Just got a call
for a little side gig.

09:04.912 --> 09:08.580
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

09:11.784 --> 09:14.920
Daniel douglas died
of a heart attack.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.221
A heart attack?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.557
Cyrus,
I need to face justice.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.660
I need to turn myself over
to the authorities.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.564
If you wanna confess,
confess--to god.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.566
Jesus wants to forgive you,
not punish you.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.268
That's why he suffered--
so you don't have to.

09:30.270 --> 09:33.305
Let him, let him forgive you
and then you show him

09:33.307 --> 09:35.707
Your loyalty by being
a good shepherd

09:35.709 --> 09:37.676
To the flock of people
you will one day

09:37.678 --> 09:39.611
Serve as president.

09:39.613 --> 09:42.213
In the meantime,
give me your sin.

09:42.215 --> 09:45.617
Let me lie.
Let me clean this up.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.827
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

09:58.164 --> 09:59.798
Uh, mr. Rosen?
I'm shelby. Shelby moss.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.366
Sorry, shelby.
We were here first.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.738
Okay, so, remember that time
I asked you to take

10:06.740 --> 10:08.840
That totally innocent client
of ours off the no-fly list?
(door closes)

10:08.842 --> 10:10.075
You mean yesterday?
Then, yes.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.643
Let's say she wasn't innocent.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.078
Abby, you're my girlfriend.
I know.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.245
We spend a great deal
of our time together.
I know.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.747
I sleep beside you.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.782
I put parts of my body
inside parts of your body,

10:17.784 --> 10:19.918
And I'm very generous
when you ask me to...

10:19.920 --> 10:21.286
I'm right here, y'all.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.887
So don't you think
I deserve a little honesty?

10:22.889 --> 10:24.389
Maybe some
professional courtesy?

10:24.391 --> 10:25.857
Just let me see
marie wallace's file.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.659
No need to make
a federal case out of it.

10:27.661 --> 10:30.662
And yet that is what I do.

10:32.098 --> 10:34.833
Fine. I'll e-mail it
to you.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.003
(olivia) where are we?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.104
Uh, we used street cams

10:39.106 --> 10:40.305
To track rowan
as he left wonderland.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.640
Someone took him, liv.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.641
Who took him?

10:42.643 --> 10:43.908
We don't know.
Of course not.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.410
Two cars blocked him in.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.746
Let's just hope
that finding my father

10:47.748 --> 10:48.847
Helps us find quinn.

10:48.849 --> 10:53.652
(typing)

10:53.654 --> 10:55.420
Hey.
Hey, cut huck some slack.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.789
Jake,
this isn't your business.
I get it.

10:57.791 --> 11:01.660
You just got your happy memories
of her taken from you.

11:01.662 --> 11:05.296
But that does not
make your father the good guy.

11:05.298 --> 11:08.366
And huck? He's about to go
out there and look for him,

11:08.368 --> 11:10.402
Try to save your father,
save the man who tortured him,

11:10.404 --> 11:11.870
Manipulated him,
threw him in a hole

11:11.872 --> 11:13.705
Until he was nearly driven
out of his mind.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.674
And then stole everything
that was important to him.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.943
But huck and I?
We are in the same business.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.312
And your father?
He is not our hero.

11:21.314 --> 11:26.317
And you're not the only one
to lose your happy memories.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.086
So I speak from experience

11:28.088 --> 11:31.256
When I say
maybe you cut huck some slack.

11:43.803 --> 11:46.071
The doctor will be here
any minute.

11:46.073 --> 11:49.040
Now remember,
he can't look too close.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.343
You can't let him look too--

11:52.345 --> 11:53.912
Sally, I need you
to snap out of it.

11:53.914 --> 11:57.482
They'll be coming through
that door any second now.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.950
Sally! Look at me.

11:58.952 --> 12:02.187
Shh, I know, I know.
I know. I'm here.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.022
Oh, doctor,
thank goodness.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.857
I came as soon as I could.
Madame vice president,

12:05.859 --> 12:09.260
Just have to check a few things
to make it official.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.463
(sighs) she called me
in a panic.

12:11.465 --> 12:14.232
Woke up next to mr. Langston,
and he wasn't breathing.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.834
Isn't that right,
madame vice president?

12:18.270 --> 12:19.738
There's no heartbeat.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.506
Madame vice president,
I'm going to need

12:21.508 --> 12:23.875
To undress him
and look a little closer.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.845
Would you like to step
out of the room for this?

12:26.847 --> 12:28.279
S-sally...

12:28.281 --> 12:32.150
Would you like to step
out of the room now?

12:32.152 --> 12:33.952
Or would you rather stay
with daniel douglas?

12:51.937 --> 12:54.038
No, don't touch him!
Don't you touch him!

12:54.040 --> 12:56.508
Nobody touches him!

12:56.510 --> 12:59.277
Doctor, she's in shock,
doctor.
(sobbing)

12:59.279 --> 13:01.379
Can we just skip
the rest of it?

13:01.381 --> 13:03.982
We all know
what happened here.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.383
Of course.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.485
I'll just report his heart
stopped a few hours ago.

13:07.487 --> 13:12.257
Let's give the vice president
some privacy. Shall we?

13:17.296 --> 13:19.197
(door closes)

13:25.238 --> 13:28.940
Because I really wanna be
the one to share the good news.

13:28.942 --> 13:33.011
Daniel douglas is dead,
cyrus.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.245
One of my aides
is sleeping with

13:34.247 --> 13:35.847
One of sally's secret service
agents,

13:35.849 --> 13:37.115
And I just found out.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.184
I'm sure you will be
getting a call any minute.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.485
God has smiled on us,
cyrus. (laughs)

13:40.487 --> 13:42.587
Sally's god,
who clearly doesn't think

13:42.589 --> 13:44.255
Much of her now that
he's thrown a wrench

13:44.257 --> 13:46.090
Into her campaign at the very
moment we needed him to.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.992
There's no way
she can run now.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.961
She'll have to grieve
for months.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.363
Are you drinking
at 7:00 in the morning?

13:52.365 --> 13:56.134
Sit down, mellie.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.570
The devil came in.
That's what she said.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.271
The devil came in,
the devil came in.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.607
The devil came in.
We came in!

14:02.609 --> 14:05.276
Ergo, we are the devil.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.011
I am actually the devil.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.580
No, a person doesn't--

14:08.582 --> 14:10.381
You should've seen me
handle it.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.584
There's a dead closeted
hillbilly on the floor.

14:12.586 --> 14:15.920
And there I am.
"give me your sin, sally."

14:15.922 --> 14:17.455
I'm at the top of my game.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.291
The devil is at the top
of his game.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.293
No, a person does not just
get prodded into this.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.262
Sally snapped.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.430
Sally is the devil.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.598
We've done many bad things,
mellie.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.200
Many, many, <i>many</i>
<i>bad things.</i>

14:29.202 --> 14:30.869
(sighs)
but this?

14:30.871 --> 14:33.238
Well, I'd say this one
takes the cake.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.139
We can quit now.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.174
Game over!

14:36.176 --> 14:37.642
(laughing)

14:37.644 --> 14:39.344
Hell hath no fury,

14:39.346 --> 14:42.013
Like a woman whose husband
is screwing another man.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.249
Cyrus, look at me.
(ice cubes rattle)

14:44.251 --> 14:46.084
Focus.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.385
This is not how the right hand
of the president behaves.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.488
Do you hear me?
Pull it together.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.660
(sighs) now tell me
you didn't use olivia pope

14:55.662 --> 15:00.064
No, she'd tell fitz.
Top of my game.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.099
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)

15:01.101 --> 15:02.400
Poor sally.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.336
Yeah, anyway,
I know you're busy,

15:05.338 --> 15:07.038
Which is why I thought
I'd head over

15:07.040 --> 15:08.373
To the observatory myself
right now.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.108
Pass on condolences
for both of us?

15:10.110 --> 15:12.110
I'll bring some flowers,
of course.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.278
I think she'd appreciate that.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.379
Thanks, mel.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.248
(hangs up receiver)

15:17.250 --> 15:19.183
(inhales deeply)

15:19.185 --> 15:20.285
(exhales deeply)

15:20.287 --> 15:22.387
(door closes)

15:22.389 --> 15:25.356
And nero fiddled
while rome burned.

15:25.358 --> 15:29.127
She was 12 years old.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.495
What kind of man...

15:30.497 --> 15:32.497
Who takes a child's mother
from them?

15:42.341 --> 15:45.376
I'm screwing her,
you know.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.046
Your daughter.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.114
Every chance I get.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.283
The things I could tell you.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.385
About the way she tastes.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.324
She's quite a girl.

15:59.326 --> 16:02.193
Talented.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.095
(huffs)

16:04.097 --> 16:05.997
(clicks tongue)

16:05.999 --> 16:08.466
(scoffs)
you're a funny, funny man.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.467
I am?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.537
Or should I say "boy"?

16:12.539 --> 16:14.005
You're a boy.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.574
You've been coddled
and cared for,

16:16.576 --> 16:19.243
Pampered and hugged.

16:19.245 --> 16:22.613
For you,
it's always summertime

16:22.615 --> 16:26.584
And the livin' is easy.
Daddy's rich!

16:26.586 --> 16:29.454
And your mama's good-looking.
You're a grant!

16:29.456 --> 16:32.523
You've got money
in your <i>blood.</i>

16:32.525 --> 16:37.462
You... Are... A... Boy.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.231
I'm a man.

16:40.233 --> 16:44.702
I have worked for every single
thing I have ever received.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.405
I have fought and scraped
and bled

16:47.407 --> 16:50.208
For every inch of ground
I walk on.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.377
I was the first in my family
to go to college,

16:52.379 --> 16:54.579
My daughter
went to boarding school

16:54.581 --> 16:57.015
With the children
of kings.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.716
<i>I</i> made that happen.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.285
You cried yourself to sleep

17:01.287 --> 17:03.354
Because daddy
hurt your feelings.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.556
Because papa banged
his secretary.

17:05.558 --> 17:08.459
Because it hurt
to have so much money.

17:08.461 --> 17:13.331
You spoiled, entitled,
ungrateful little brat!

17:13.333 --> 17:15.333
You have <i>everything</i>

17:15.335 --> 17:17.535
Handed to you
on a silver platter,

17:17.537 --> 17:19.704
And you squander it.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.540
You're given the world,
and you can't appreciate it

17:22.542 --> 17:26.677
Because you haven't had
to work for anything!

17:26.679 --> 17:29.547
So now you've decided that
the one thing that you want

17:29.549 --> 17:31.115
Is my daughter, my child.

17:31.117 --> 17:34.685
Mine. What I made.
What <i>I</i> created.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.821
You could talk about
what a great lay she is

17:36.823 --> 17:38.656
To try to get a response
from me all you want.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.224
But guess what?

17:40.226 --> 17:43.061
I am actually quite literally
above your pay grade,

17:43.063 --> 17:47.365
That I know that you believe
that you are in love with her.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.434
As wrong as you may be.
I do love her.

17:49.436 --> 17:54.305
You <i>love</i> that
she is a door marked "exit."

17:54.307 --> 17:59.343
You <i>love</i> that
she is your way out.

17:59.345 --> 18:00.845
Because if you
are with olivia pope,

18:00.847 --> 18:03.414
You don't have to fulfill
your father's dream

18:03.416 --> 18:04.515
Of being president.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.350
If you are with olivia,

18:06.352 --> 18:12.356
You no longer have to be
your father's son.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.792
An apple never falls
too far from the tree.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.328
You are always going to be

18:17.330 --> 18:21.799
Senator grant's
disappointing boy, fitz.

18:21.801 --> 18:27.405
<i>She</i> is always going to be
the formidable olivia pope.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.574
Don't use the person
that I made

18:29.576 --> 18:33.778
To make <i>you</i> into a man.
You're a boy.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.314
You don't know anything
about me.

18:36.316 --> 18:41.486
Sadly, <i>boy,</i> I know everything
about you.

18:41.488 --> 18:44.489
You... Disappoint me

18:44.491 --> 18:47.492
As a suitor
for my daughter's hand.

18:50.662 --> 18:53.798
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

18:57.302 --> 18:58.636
Liv?

19:01.507 --> 19:02.807
(folder thuds)

19:02.809 --> 19:03.908
She was born in east london.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.176
Both parents were linked

19:05.178 --> 19:06.410
To
the marxist liberation front.

19:06.412 --> 19:11.482
Until she popped up in paris
under the alias margaux bouvier.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.483
In germany,
she was known as hannah stuart.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.218
Tunisia, ines bassir.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.320
Somalia, saafi ali farah.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.555
The list goes on
until she came to the u.S.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.224
In 1972 as maya lewis,
soon to be maya pope.

19:20.226 --> 19:22.827
But to her contacts overseas,
she was known as--
marie wallace.

19:22.829 --> 19:27.198
By numerous anti-american groups
to steal classified documents

19:27.200 --> 19:28.733
From high-level officers
at the c.I.A.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.402
My mother was stealing
government secrets

19:31.404 --> 19:32.870
From my father. (scoffs)

19:32.872 --> 19:35.406
She didn't kill anyone.
There's no blood on her hands.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.908
Your dad kept her locked up
for 22 years,

19:36.910 --> 19:39.377
Away from the world,
away from you,

19:39.379 --> 19:41.345
Maybe...
Maybe what, abby?

19:41.347 --> 19:43.214
Maybe she's served her time.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.349
That plane lands
in less than eight hours.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.785
No one would know
if she just... Walked away.

19:51.558 --> 19:54.792
<i>Husband to vice president</i>
<i>sally langston,</i>

19:54.794 --> 19:57.628
<i>Is dead this morning</i>
<i>of an apparent heart attack.</i>

19:57.630 --> 20:01.766
<i>Reports say the vice president</i>
<i>woke to find him unconscious...</i>

20:01.768 --> 20:04.735
I was hoping to get to you
before the news broke.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.872
Why? So you could control me?
Tell me more lies?

20:07.874 --> 20:09.440
Honey...

20:09.442 --> 20:11.375
Will you pl--

20:11.377 --> 20:14.345
<i>...To be made available</i>
<i>to the press</i>

20:14.347 --> 20:16.480
<i>Later this morning.</i>

20:16.482 --> 20:17.815
<i>At this time,</i>
<i>friends and family</i>

20:17.817 --> 20:19.283
<i>Have begun to arrive at the...</i>

20:19.285 --> 20:20.985
What most upsets you, james?

20:20.987 --> 20:23.321
The realization that you
may have married a murderer?

20:23.323 --> 20:25.690
Or the sad fact
that your closeted fling

20:25.692 --> 20:27.959
Will never be able
to bend you over a desk again?

20:27.961 --> 20:30.895
While I know your inner tween
would love for me

20:30.897 --> 20:33.698
To have flown off in a fit
of uncontrollable jealous rage

20:33.700 --> 20:36.567
And killed daniel douglas,
that did not happen!

20:36.569 --> 20:38.469
It was a coincidence.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.904
And if
I'm being entirely honest,

20:39.906 --> 20:43.341
Not a completely
unwelcome one.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.510
But I'm deeply, deeply sorry
for your loss.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.746
<i>(tv continues playing</i>
<i>indistinctly)</i>

21:00.425 --> 21:01.826
Okay,
we amend our announcement,

21:01.828 --> 21:04.662
We'll push it back
four weeks...

21:04.664 --> 21:07.431
Six, even...

21:07.433 --> 21:08.499
However long you need.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.634
Leo, please.

21:11.536 --> 21:13.704
My dear sally...

21:13.706 --> 21:16.607
You can run on
almost anything now, right?

21:16.609 --> 21:19.010
Health care,
wounded veterans?

21:19.012 --> 21:20.945
We frame you
as a courageous widow,

21:20.947 --> 21:22.680
Soldiering on
for her country

21:22.682 --> 21:24.782
In the face of
insurmountable personal tragedy.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.685
It's sympathetic, strong,
yet accessible,

21:27.687 --> 21:28.786
An instant brand--

21:28.788 --> 21:30.421
Sally.

21:30.423 --> 21:33.291
Sally, I am so sorry.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.625
Fitz wanted to be here,
but I told him

21:34.627 --> 21:36.594
To give you
a little bit more time.

21:36.596 --> 21:39.530
Leo... I didn't realize
the two of you know each other.

21:39.532 --> 21:40.965
We're old friends.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.534
Oh, it's so nice to have
the support of friends

21:43.536 --> 21:45.369
At a time like this.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.743
I will check in
on you later, sally.

21:52.745 --> 21:55.680
Madame first lady.

21:55.682 --> 21:59.884
(inhales deeply)

21:59.886 --> 22:02.353
We're taking care
of all of it...
(door closes)

22:02.355 --> 22:05.656
The funeral preparation,
the ceremony...

22:05.658 --> 22:07.992
The coroner.

22:07.994 --> 22:11.829
(whispers)
cyrus? He told you?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.698
No need to worry
about any of that.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.866
Not at a time like this.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.802
You look exhausted.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.103
You really should reconsider

22:19.105 --> 22:21.005
Welcoming all of these visitors,
sally.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.707
Especially people like
leo bergen.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.710
Now is not the time,

22:25.712 --> 22:28.546
Given everything
that's transpired.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.649
I am just so glad
that we can be here for you

22:31.651 --> 22:34.518
In this terribly sad time.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.388
And I am so hopeful
for the future

22:37.390 --> 22:41.459
That we'll share together,
supporting our president,

22:41.461 --> 22:43.928
Working for the good
of the nation.

22:43.930 --> 22:47.465
You're home now.
Part of our family.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.942
(chuckles)
score. Fancy shampoo.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.577
I need to go home.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.978
I need underwear.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.513
And I don't even have
my driver's license.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.014
You know you can't
go home now.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.750
Not with huck
on your scent.

23:07.886 --> 23:11.655
Ah. What's wrong, robsies?

23:11.657 --> 23:13.090
You know what I was thinking
about last week?

23:13.092 --> 23:16.527
Like, really thinking
about hard?

23:16.529 --> 23:19.730
Whether or not
to get highlights in my hair.

23:19.732 --> 23:23.167
I used to be so... Normal,
I mean, yeah,

23:23.169 --> 23:30.174
So maybe not <i>normal</i> normal,
but... It was my normal.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.676
Nobody was
pulling my teeth out.

23:32.678 --> 23:33.778
Hey.

23:33.780 --> 23:34.879
Listen to me.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.180
You...

23:36.182 --> 23:41.085
A girl like you
was never meant to be normal.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.454
See, you got skills.
Instincts,

23:43.456 --> 23:46.857
Abilities that very, very
few people on this planet have.

23:46.859 --> 23:50.795
You are freaking
spectacular.

23:53.698 --> 23:58.536
Look, if you wanna leave,
I'm not gonna stop you.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.138
If you love someone,
set 'em free and all that crap.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.707
But why don't you
sleep on it?

24:03.709 --> 24:06.544
You look tired.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.779
I am.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.147
So tired.

24:10.149 --> 24:11.782
Yeah.
(slaps legs)

24:19.624 --> 24:22.426
Mmm, don't change your hair.
I like it. (kisses)

24:26.231 --> 24:27.932
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

24:27.934 --> 24:31.569
The vice president's
husband, he's--
gay. Yes.

24:31.571 --> 24:34.738
And either cyrus got jealous
or langston got jealous,

24:34.740 --> 24:35.773
'cause the next thing
I know,

24:35.775 --> 24:38.976
I know it sounds preposterous,
and maybe I'm wrong.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.045
I hope I am.
But what if I'm not?

24:41.047 --> 24:44.014
What if the man was murdered
and no one finds out about it?
(opens drawer)

24:44.016 --> 24:45.115
We've got to dig into this,
david,

24:45.117 --> 24:46.984
Before they put
the body in the ground.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.185
What is this?

24:48.187 --> 24:49.587
A quiz I gave my students

24:49.589 --> 24:50.821
Back when I was
a substitute teacher.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.023
My one keepsake
from that very special time.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.592
Read the first question
to me, would you?

24:54.594 --> 24:55.993
"in what town was

24:55.995 --> 24:57.761
The shot heard
'round the world fired?"

24:57.763 --> 24:59.864
And what was
the student's answer?

24:59.866 --> 25:01.599
What was his answer,
james?

25:01.601 --> 25:03.033
He drew a picture
of a penis.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.503
And his answer
to the rest of the questions?

25:05.505 --> 25:06.570
All penises.
All penises.

25:06.572 --> 25:09.974
I trusted my career to you,
and you destroyed it.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.275
This is different.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.276
Why? Because last time
it was election rigging,

25:12.278 --> 25:13.277
And this time it's murder?

25:13.279 --> 25:14.712
You have to trust me.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.981
No, actually, I don't.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.984
(harrison) so she was a woman
without a country.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.719
With no ideology whatsoever.

25:21.721 --> 25:24.054
So why wouldn't liv's dad
just confiscate the luggage

25:24.056 --> 25:25.523
When the plane landed?

25:25.525 --> 25:27.291
Why kill 300 people
over a bunch of a files?

25:27.293 --> 25:31.729
Maybe he thought it was more
than just the files.

25:37.969 --> 25:40.571
(huck) okay, looks like
they're headed northwest.

25:40.573 --> 25:41.739
Make a right up here.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.841
(typing)
switching to another cam.

25:50.015 --> 25:51.849
What's wrong?
I lost them.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.183
Well, they couldn't
just disappear.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.686
Well, there's a blind spot
between these two feeds.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.721
Map's showing there's
a parking garage ahead.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.558
Maybe they slipped in there,
swapped out the cars?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.192
I don't think so.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.562
Well, where else could
they have gone?

26:10.702 --> 26:12.803
Liv.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.572
I know
where your father is.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.740
He's in the pentagon.

26:24.716 --> 26:26.951
(knock on door)

26:28.954 --> 26:30.187
Hello?

26:30.189 --> 26:31.689
I know you have my father.

26:31.691 --> 26:32.990
(sighs)

26:32.992 --> 26:34.058
I need to talk to him.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.326
I know you think
he's the bad guy--

26:35.328 --> 26:36.794
He <i>is</i> the bad guy.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.228
I need to talk to him,
fitz, please.

26:42.667 --> 26:43.968
You shouldn't have
brought her here.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.970
Dad, look at me.

26:47.739 --> 26:50.074
Look at me.

26:54.212 --> 26:57.881
There was a bomb
on that plane, wasn't there?

26:57.883 --> 26:59.249
You pulled her off,
and you interrogated her,

26:59.251 --> 27:01.552
And that's what you found out.
But it was too late.

27:01.554 --> 27:02.753
The plane had already
taken off.

27:02.755 --> 27:03.954
So you made
a judgment call.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.690
Kill 329 people
and spare the thousands

27:06.692 --> 27:08.125
Of lives
that would've been lost

27:08.127 --> 27:10.794
If it had detonated
over london.

27:12.130 --> 27:16.233
Except that doesn't...
Make sense.

27:16.235 --> 27:20.938
As I sit here and say that
it doesn't make sense.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.640
Because she was
a gun for hire.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.642
She went wherever
the money was--

27:24.644 --> 27:27.945
China, eastern europe,
didn't matter who she sold to,

27:27.947 --> 27:29.980
So why was she willing
to board a plane

27:29.982 --> 27:31.715
That was going to blow up
over london?

27:31.717 --> 27:34.118
It's not like
she believed in anything.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.693
Unless...

27:42.695 --> 27:43.894
She lied to you.

27:46.297 --> 27:49.400
What?

27:49.402 --> 27:53.203
She told you
there was a bomb on the plane.

27:53.205 --> 27:56.173
But it was a lie.

27:56.175 --> 27:59.143
There never was a bomb,
was there?

27:59.145 --> 28:01.845
She got you to kill

28:01.847 --> 28:06.383
Hundreds of people
all for nothing.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.953
She fooled you
like she fooled me.

28:12.924 --> 28:14.858
Didn't she?

28:18.063 --> 28:22.232
(crying) dad?

28:22.234 --> 28:23.834
Didn't she?!

28:31.710 --> 28:33.477
(exhales sharply)

28:42.420 --> 28:46.123
Have her arrested the <i>second</i>
<i>she gets off that plane.</i>

28:46.125 --> 28:48.459
You <i>get</i> her.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.271
(clatter)

29:01.273 --> 29:03.807
B613 is not an individual.

29:03.809 --> 29:04.975
Cut off the head of the snake,

29:04.977 --> 29:06.243
And another will grow
in its place.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.779
Remember that, mr. President.

29:08.781 --> 29:11.115
I'd like my coat back.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.783
Please.

29:12.785 --> 29:14.251
And my tie.

29:29.067 --> 29:31.135
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

29:37.208 --> 29:39.276
(exhales)

29:51.156 --> 29:52.422
(door closes)

30:08.873 --> 30:09.907
(objects clatter)

30:09.909 --> 30:11.842
I'm back.

30:14.045 --> 30:16.146
Huck, I came back.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.583
You really don't have
anything to say to me?

30:19.585 --> 30:22.953
Do you want me to say
that I'm sorry?

30:22.955 --> 30:26.890
Sorry for hurting you?
Sorry for making you talk?

30:26.892 --> 30:29.092
I'm not sorry.

30:29.094 --> 30:32.229
I would've pulled out
all of your teeth.

30:32.231 --> 30:35.232
I would've peeled off
all of your skin.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.134
If it wasn't for olivia,
I would kill you right now.

30:37.136 --> 30:40.137
Right here.

30:40.139 --> 30:44.174
Liv saves us,
and you betrayed her.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.143
You're not
a gladiator anymore.

31:00.158 --> 31:01.558
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)

31:12.637 --> 31:15.339
(exhales deeply)

31:15.341 --> 31:17.507
What happens now?

31:17.509 --> 31:20.477
(scoffs)
"what happens now?"

31:20.479 --> 31:24.615
What happens.. Now?

31:24.617 --> 31:26.283
Do you wanna fight?

31:26.285 --> 31:27.885
Because I-I don't
wanna fight.

31:27.887 --> 31:30.187
You wanna yell at me?
Go ahead, I'll listen.

31:30.189 --> 31:34.191
You wanna call the police?
You don't have any evidence.

31:34.193 --> 31:37.027
Do you wanna take ella
and leave me?

31:37.029 --> 31:42.332
Or the... Ability
to outrun my legal connections

31:42.334 --> 31:44.234
That will fight to give me
sole custody

31:44.236 --> 31:45.669
Of that sweet little girl
in the next room

31:45.671 --> 31:47.237
That I bought for you.

31:47.239 --> 31:52.276
Do you wanna not love me
anymore?

31:52.278 --> 31:55.245
Because I still love you.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.947
You're still
the love of my life.

31:56.949 --> 31:59.917
And I'm still the same man
you married.

31:59.919 --> 32:02.119
You just
maybe never noticed...

32:02.121 --> 32:07.024
The "6-6-6" on my forehead
before.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.558
But now you see it.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.264
(chuckles)
I'm--I'm hoping...

32:16.601 --> 32:20.003
You'll love me anyway.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.305
I'm hoping
"for better or for worse"

32:21.307 --> 32:23.240
Means something to you.

32:23.242 --> 32:28.178
But maybe--maybe it doesn't.
Maybe...

32:28.180 --> 32:31.281
L-love isn't enough.

32:31.283 --> 32:35.018
So...

32:35.020 --> 32:38.422
I'm standing here,
afraid...

32:38.424 --> 32:40.991
And in my underwear
and without my soul,

32:40.993 --> 32:44.328
Asking you what--
what happens now?

32:48.333 --> 32:50.267
I'll give you some time
to answer.

32:50.269 --> 32:51.168
You take all the time
you need.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.503
But think carefully.

32:53.505 --> 32:57.040
Think with your heart.

33:04.482 --> 33:05.716
(door closes)

33:05.718 --> 33:09.119
(exhales deeply)

33:09.121 --> 33:12.222
(cell phone chiming)

33:12.224 --> 33:13.390
(ring)

33:13.392 --> 33:14.558
(ring)

33:14.560 --> 33:16.259
What happened?
Did they arrest her?

33:16.261 --> 33:18.228
The plane never made it
to hong kong.

33:19.197 --> 33:21.164
We found it
in darkhan, mongolia.

33:21.166 --> 33:24.368
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

33:28.306 --> 33:29.439
She's gone.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.641
(exhales)

33:41.519 --> 33:43.186
I've got contacts
in that corner of the world.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.287
If she comes up for air...

33:44.289 --> 33:46.456
She's not coming up
for air.

33:46.458 --> 33:49.659
She's gone.
She's in the wind.

33:49.661 --> 33:51.428
Look, about my dad--

33:51.430 --> 33:53.397
It's okay.
We don't need to talk about it.
No, we do.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.265
He's not a man
with a short memory.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.299
The attempt you made
on his life,

33:56.301 --> 33:57.434
The president dragging him

33:57.436 --> 33:58.802
Into the basement
of the pentagon--

33:58.804 --> 34:01.972
I wouldn't underestimate
the president.

34:15.620 --> 34:18.055
I came to say good-bye.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.790
Jake...

34:26.064 --> 34:27.597
I loved you.

34:27.599 --> 34:30.367
Whatever happens next,

34:30.369 --> 34:32.702
I wanna make sure you know
that I...

34:32.704 --> 34:34.104
Loved you.

34:39.343 --> 34:40.844
I love you.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.717
Jake...

34:51.255 --> 34:53.090
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)

35:47.579 --> 35:50.714
And your entire

35:50.716 --> 35:51.915
Leo,
you really should leave.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.750
It's done.
Someone might see you.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.887
My father died of leukemia
when I was 19.

35:56.889 --> 35:59.623
And people I had never
met before came up to me

35:59.625 --> 36:02.893
"and we're praying for you,"
and then two weeks later...

36:02.895 --> 36:07.564
Leo, I am not running.
I just think it's best--
best!

36:07.566 --> 36:10.600
Best. For whom?
For you?

36:10.602 --> 36:11.835
Or for
the grant administration?

36:11.837 --> 36:13.537
Because cyrus beene

36:13.539 --> 36:15.805
Is taking your grief
and bending it over.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.741
He is milking it
for every ounce

36:17.743 --> 36:19.809
Of political capital he can
to keep <i>you,</i>

36:19.811 --> 36:21.811
Their vice president. Why?

36:21.813 --> 36:25.282
Because he knows that even
without daniel douglas,

36:25.284 --> 36:26.616
You could slaughter fitz
and the general

36:26.618 --> 36:27.851
And become president.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.753
So they may be on your side
right now,

36:29.755 --> 36:31.688
But I promise you,
sally, in two weeks,

36:31.690 --> 36:33.523
They will not be
"sorry for your loss,"

36:33.525 --> 36:35.458
Or "helping you
in the days ahead."

36:35.460 --> 36:37.761
Tell me you do not
want to be the president

36:37.763 --> 36:40.830
Tell me that daniel douglas
did not want that for you.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.499
Because I know he did.

36:42.501 --> 36:44.968
I know that he is up
in heaven right now

36:44.970 --> 36:46.770
Telling those other dead people
that his sally

36:46.772 --> 36:49.973
Will be the first female
president of the United States.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.841
He is in hell!

36:53.811 --> 36:58.215
Daniel douglas...
Is... In... Hell.

36:58.217 --> 37:01.518
Because...

37:01.520 --> 37:03.753
He is a sodomite.

37:03.755 --> 37:07.857
He is a godless sinner,
and he deserved what he got.

37:16.667 --> 37:17.968
You killed him?

37:19.737 --> 37:21.371
You killed him.

37:21.373 --> 37:24.374
(exhales deeply)

37:24.376 --> 37:27.877
And you called
the white house?!

37:27.879 --> 37:31.014
I am your first call,
sally.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.583
I am always your first call!

37:33.585 --> 37:36.686
You kill somebody,
you call me.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.391
(knock on door)

37:41.393 --> 37:42.892
You never got to me
yesterday.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.828
I waited all day.
I can't wait any longer.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.896
Is that your cell?
What the hell?

37:46.898 --> 37:48.865
Uh, there's this new technology
that allows the n.S.A.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.433
To hack into
people's cell phones

37:50.435 --> 37:51.935
And record whatever's happening
in the room they're in.

37:51.937 --> 37:52.936
Yeah, I watch the news,
too.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.337
I wrote the code for it.

37:54.339 --> 37:57.641
I'm a junior engineer
at mcgregor logistics.

37:57.643 --> 38:01.278
Promised me I'd be doing
cutting edge research.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.846
Then they won
an n.S.A. Contract.

38:02.848 --> 38:05.615
Yeah, I'm the wrong person
to ask for career advice.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.685
And then I remembered you
from the press conference--

38:08.687 --> 38:11.454
The c.I.A. Mole thing.
So...

38:11.456 --> 38:12.756

You lied for 22 years.

Was it all just
to save your reputation?

38:42.554 --> 38:43.720
Your job? Or was it--

38:43.722 --> 38:44.788
What are you asking me?

38:44.790 --> 38:49.859
Was it you trying
to protect me...

38:49.861 --> 38:51.461
