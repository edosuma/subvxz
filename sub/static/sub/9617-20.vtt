♪♪

00:06.807 --> 00:09.341
We have changed the life of
somebody in this room.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.542
Oh, please not me.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.311
I'm happy with my life
the way it is.

00:12.313 --> 00:14.346
I got tall, and my teeth
came in nicely.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.017
Yeah, we're not talking
about you two.

00:18.019 --> 00:20.619
Oh, no. What'd you do?

00:20.621 --> 00:23.055
Oh, lucas, in your
whole history,

00:23.057 --> 00:26.125
We know what has always been
your biggest regret.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.760
(quietly) baaaah.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.396
What's that?
Why would you do that?

00:30.398 --> 00:31.563
Baaaah!

00:31.565 --> 00:33.298
You used to be
a champion sheep rider

00:33.300 --> 00:36.301
At the mutton bustin' rodeo,
until you fell off
of judy the sheep.

00:36.303 --> 00:39.038
And then you gave up,
but you never got over it.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.973
That is my deepest,
darkest secret.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.975
No one knows I fell off
judy the sheep except...

00:47.248 --> 00:49.915
They made me, lucas.
They made me.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.483
How did they make you?

00:51.485 --> 00:55.254
(sighs) I said, "y'all wanna
hear a great lucas story?"

00:55.256 --> 00:57.289
They said, "yes."

00:59.360 --> 01:00.993
Okay, it doesn't matter.
I'm over it.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.795
I don't think about
that day at all.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.971
(sniffle) I fell off
that sheep so fast.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.474
No one likes me.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.578
Lucas, you can
fix this.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.347
Get back on that sheep
and be a sheep champion.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.249
We have made
that possible.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.252
How? How'd you make
that possible?

01:27.254 --> 01:28.654
Show it to him.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.790
Ride, lucas! Ride, boy!

01:31.792 --> 01:33.525
We have
entered you in--

01:33.527 --> 01:35.694
The annual
mutton busting
tournament!

01:35.696 --> 01:37.229
In austin, texas!

01:37.231 --> 01:38.931
In front of
everybody you know.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.199
Both: Yay!

01:40.201 --> 01:42.201
You can't enter me
in mutton busters.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.703
You can't be over
eight years old or
over 55 pounds.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.371
You are wrong,
young lucas.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.674
We entered you last week
and your application
has been accepted.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.312
"congratulations,
lucas friar.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.247
"you are an official entry
in this year's

01:55.249 --> 01:57.249
"austin round up rodeo.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.118
"you will be riding
tombstone the sheep."

01:59.120 --> 02:01.220
What? Tombstone?

02:01.222 --> 02:03.222
Oh, well, that's
the end of you.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.389
Why is it
the end of him?

02:04.391 --> 02:05.591
What's the difference
between riding

02:05.593 --> 02:07.392
Judy the sheep
and tombstone the sheep?

02:07.394 --> 02:08.894
Read it again.

02:09.964 --> 02:12.431
Blah blah blah. Over the age
and weight limit for
mutton busters.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.399
Blah. We have placed you
in the adult rodeo

02:14.401 --> 02:15.968
Where you will, blah,
ride tombstone the sheep.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.971
Oh, you only got
one word wrong.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.508
Let's see if they find
that one word.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.910
Blah blah blah
blahdy blah

02:24.912 --> 02:26.812
Blah blah blah
blahdy blah blah blah

02:26.814 --> 02:28.780
Blah blahdy blah.
Oh, bull!

02:28.782 --> 02:30.315
Ah, she found it.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.153
You signed me up to
ride tombstone the bull!

02:35.089 --> 02:36.388
Are you excited?

02:37.691 --> 02:38.991
What's the difference
between

02:38.993 --> 02:40.259
Riding a sheep
and riding a bull?

02:40.261 --> 02:42.895
Death.
Death is the difference.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.731
All right.
May we begin class?

02:47.601 --> 02:49.601
The railroad.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.869
I don't get it.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.205
What do you mean
you don't get it, farkle?

02:53.207 --> 02:56.108
How's the railroad tie into
what's going on in our lives,
hambone?

02:56.110 --> 02:58.677
You just gonna let him
call you, "hambone," matthews?

02:58.679 --> 03:02.281
The railroad allowed us
to travel great distances.

03:02.283 --> 03:05.817
The railroad allowed us
to see how other people live.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.387
When you see how
other people live,

03:08.389 --> 03:09.354
It changes you.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.357
And I like "hambone."
it's cool.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.360
Riley, rip it up
before he finds out.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.628
-Who?
-He's gonna find out,

03:16.630 --> 03:18.330
And when he does,
nothing will stop him.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.365
-Who?
-Oh, you'll know who.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.967
You'll hear his
big, booming voice.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.636
He'll say somethin'--
he'll say somethin' like--

03:24.638 --> 03:27.406
This country was built
on railroads.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.908
I myself, just arrived
on the noon train

03:29.910 --> 03:32.878
From austin, texarkana
and arkadelphia.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.246
Guess why I'm here.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.417
Anybody?

03:38.419 --> 03:41.853
(laughs) I'm here because
I could not be more proud

03:41.855 --> 03:43.388
Of my grandboy, lucas.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.491
Pappy joe.
That's your pappy joe.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.961
That's pappy joe.
Yes! More stuff!

03:49.930 --> 03:52.531
That right there
is the first friar

03:52.533 --> 03:54.566
That ever had the courage

03:54.568 --> 03:58.770
To ride the most ferocious
creature in all of creation.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.440
Are we talking about
judy the sheep, pappy joe?

04:01.442 --> 04:04.409
(laughs) judy the sheep!

04:04.411 --> 04:06.445
Remember when you fell off
of judy the sheep

04:06.447 --> 04:08.547
For about two seconds, boy?
Remember that?

04:08.549 --> 04:11.583
And we all said "it was okay,"
'cause you were only
five years old.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.686
So we said, "it was okay,"
but it wasn't okay,

04:14.688 --> 04:16.922
Because you were
a disgrace to the community

04:16.924 --> 04:19.524
And you dragged your family name
through the mud hole

04:19.526 --> 04:20.525
Right up to this day.

04:20.527 --> 04:23.195
You put us in the mud hole,
remember boy?

04:23.197 --> 04:25.264
Yes.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.065
There is one moment
in every man's life

04:27.067 --> 04:28.867
That shapes
who he is forever.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.136
My moment was
judy the sheep.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.639
Well, you know what,
lucas friar?

04:34.775 --> 04:35.974
Forgiven.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.645
You get on that bull
for more than three seconds

04:39.647 --> 04:42.047
And you will be the master
of tombstone the bull,

04:42.049 --> 04:43.782
And I'll tell you,
"I love you."

04:43.784 --> 04:46.318
And that's somethin'
I've never said to
another human.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.753
Can we talk about this?

04:47.755 --> 04:49.488
Time for talkin's over.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.156
I got a permission slip.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.424
Babineaux,

04:52.426 --> 04:54.493
Got one for you, too.
Come on, boys.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.761
Let's go ride.

04:55.763 --> 04:59.398
Yeehaw!

05:01.502 --> 05:02.868
That slipped out.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.309

(train whistle)

06:28.522 --> 06:30.155
Man, I look good in my

06:30.157 --> 06:32.457
"welcome to texas,"
billy buckaroo
cowboy hat.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.461
That ain't a hat.

06:37.664 --> 06:38.930
That's teacup.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.668
This is a hat.

06:45.606 --> 06:46.772
How's it look?

06:46.774 --> 06:48.673
Not bad, farkle.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.641
Welcome home.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.581
Well, look at you two
little darlins.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.784
(chuckles) told you
this was the best way

06:58.786 --> 07:01.653
To spend all of our
allowance money on
the first day.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.356
Quit looking at us,
huckleberry.

07:04.358 --> 07:05.924
I'm sorry, maya.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.859
You look... Good.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.362
Oh, thanks.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.696
Yeah, you both
look good.

07:11.698 --> 07:12.798
(chuckles)

07:15.569 --> 07:17.636
You know what
this place needs?

07:17.638 --> 07:18.937
A bay window.

07:18.939 --> 07:22.140
Bay window, right now.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.614
What's a bay winda?

07:28.615 --> 07:30.649
Oh, you know, a safe place
where the girls have
their private talks.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.385
Oh, well then...

07:33.387 --> 07:36.221
I'll make sure those two
stay right there, forever.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.725
-Pappy joe! Pappy joe!
Pappy joe!
-Whoa, whoa.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.627
Don't be alarmed.
It's just cletus.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.596
Tombstone the bull
gone crazy!

07:44.598 --> 07:46.731
He everywhere
all over the place
at the same time

07:46.733 --> 07:48.300
Like one of them
houdini bulls.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.402
Use your words, cletus.

07:50.404 --> 07:54.673
I am using my words,
garducky.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.809
Tombstone the bull gone
bananahooey!

07:57.811 --> 07:59.945
I love him.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.813
What did
tombstone the bull do?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.849
He done tore up
the china shop,

08:03.851 --> 08:04.850
Ironically.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.686
It's true
what them say.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.120
You mean he
broke out of his pen?

08:09.122 --> 08:10.989
Oh he brammoed the pen!

08:12.759 --> 08:14.226
What's them,
a bay winder?

08:15.529 --> 08:17.596
Ah, that's riley

08:17.598 --> 08:19.865
Oh, well how dee doo.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.466
-Well how.

08:25.772 --> 08:28.039
Gah! Oh!

08:28.041 --> 08:30.642
(laughs) wait, did they get
tombstone back in his pen,
cletus?

08:30.644 --> 08:33.211
Yessir. We shot him
fulla sleepy juice,

08:33.213 --> 08:35.046
But I seen the look
in them red eyes

08:35.048 --> 08:36.948
Just afore he went

08:36.950 --> 08:38.950
And when he wake up,

08:38.952 --> 08:41.286
Huh-huuurr!

08:49.863 --> 08:51.530

08:53.467 --> 08:55.367
Huh-huuurr!

08:55.369 --> 08:56.868
Oh. (clears throat)

09:03.176 --> 09:04.309
What?

09:04.311 --> 09:06.978
Huh-huuurrr!

09:06.980 --> 09:10.582
I know it's early,
but my life is complete.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.983
Well, thankee.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.752
No, thank-ee.

09:13.754 --> 09:17.856
All I know is, I feel sorry
for the po' fool gonna ride
on tombstone.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.724
Did I tell you
what he done did today?

09:21.361 --> 09:24.529
Lucas is gonna ride
old tombstone in
the rodeo, cletus.

09:24.531 --> 09:25.897
Oh.

09:27.868 --> 09:28.800
Oh.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.470
Oh no.

Lukey...

09:45.552 --> 09:47.118
Bye, lukey.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.365
Goodbye.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.739
Announcer: <i> Welcome, once again,</i>
<i>to the austin roundup rodeo.</i>

10:07.741 --> 10:09.441
I will ride you.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.109
I will ride you for
more than three seconds.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.745
I will be the master
of tombstone the bull.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.414
(snorts)

10:16.416 --> 10:17.949
All right, how bad
is this gonna be?

10:17.951 --> 10:20.085
(bellows angrily)

10:20.087 --> 10:21.152
Great.

10:25.726 --> 10:30.128
I will ride you. I will be
the master of judy the sheep.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.830
(bleats)

10:31.832 --> 10:34.499
Yeah, that's right, judy.
It's me.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.401
(bleats loudly)

10:36.403 --> 10:37.802
You leave me alone!

10:39.806 --> 10:42.007
Good luck, friar.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.909
Good luck, mccullough.

10:44.911 --> 10:49.948
Announcer: <i> Y'all be sure to</i>
<i>stop by our air conditioned</i>
<i>refreshment tent.</i>

10:49.950 --> 10:51.616
Oh, hi. Hey.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.318
Uh, yeah. I just saw
tombstone the bull,

10:53.320 --> 10:54.953
And, uh,
why do you hate me?

10:54.955 --> 10:57.522
Come on, a bull
is just a man cow.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.290
You're a-scared
of a man cow.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.660
A-moooo.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.929
You two have never actually
seen a bull, have you?

11:04.931 --> 11:07.666
No. What we'd like to see
are some cold drinks

11:07.668 --> 11:10.268
Inside an air conditioned
refreshment tent.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.270
-Oh, lookee here.
-(gasp)

11:13.607 --> 11:15.306
I just think you may
react differently

11:15.308 --> 11:16.775
When you actually see
a man cow.

11:16.777 --> 11:21.046
Announcer: <i> Oh, boy.</i>
<i>It's hotter out here than</i>
<i>my mamma's barbecue sauce.</i>

11:21.048 --> 11:22.380
Hey, zay.
What are you watching?

11:22.382 --> 11:24.215
Not anything
you want to see.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.718
Announcer:
<i>Hey there, rodeo fans.</i>

11:26.720 --> 11:28.286
<i>Now, for your</i>
<i>viewing pleasure,</i>

11:28.288 --> 11:30.355
<i>Some of last year's</i>
<i>greatest hits.</i>

11:30.357 --> 11:33.725
<i>These, here, are what</i>
<i>we call "love taps."</i>

11:45.238 --> 11:47.172
I don't want you going
anywhere near that bull.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.174
(scoffs)
yeah, that makes
two of us.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.309
I want you to take off
that stupid outfit,

11:51.311 --> 11:52.343
And I wanna
get outta here.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.179
-Maya.
-I saw the bull.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.247
I don't think the bull knows
this is supposed to be fun.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.184
Okay, maya, let's not shake
lucas' confidence.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.518
You can do this, right?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.187
You can just ride a bull
for four seconds

12:02.189 --> 12:03.822
And win the master
of tombstone award?

12:03.824 --> 12:05.557
Lucas is gonna need
a tombstone.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.158
There isn't gonna be
any more lucas.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.027
He's going to
do great, maya.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.229
Zay, tell him,
"he's going to do great."

12:11.231 --> 12:12.530
-You'll do great.
-Truth.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.598
You're gonna die.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.001
I believe in you.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.870
I believe that you can do
anything you want to.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.205
Riley, why do you
want him to do this?

12:20.207 --> 12:23.708
Because this is better
than riding judy the sheep,

12:23.710 --> 12:26.244
And I don't want him
to be a disgrace to his
community anymore.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.513
Well, I don't actually think
that I'm a disgrace to
the community.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.581
You are.

12:30.684 --> 12:32.117
I've been talking
to people.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.785
They have long memories
around here.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.355
Baaaah.

12:37.357 --> 12:40.125
See? I have to do this.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.794
Okay, then go out there.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.529
Be the hero
I know you are.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.431
Thank you, riley.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.433
The mutton busters are
getting ready to ride,

12:48.435 --> 12:49.601
Then it's you, lucas.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.436
Make us proud, boy.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.404
-Friar.
-Mccullough.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.707
I'm talking
to young friar.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.209
So, you fixin' to
ride again, huh?

12:58.211 --> 13:00.445
-That's right.
-Well...

13:00.447 --> 13:01.913
Don't think about
last time.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.882
(chuckles)
you don't want
that in your head.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.453
Let's watch my grandson, timmy
master judy the sheep.

13:09.456 --> 13:14.559
Oh, you were about two seconds
on judy the sheep, as I recall.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.761
But don't let that
be in your head.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.330
How come you
ain't out there
with your grandson?

13:19.332 --> 13:22.100
Well, then I wouldn't have
the pleasure of watching him

13:22.102 --> 13:24.402
Right in front of
your face.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.907
Announcer: <i> And now,</i>

14:00.507 --> 14:02.440
Sorry, riley.

<i>Bull ridin'!</i>

14:12.219 --> 14:16.054
<i>And this year, will we finally</i>

14:16.056 --> 14:19.624

14:33.506 --> 14:35.240
<i>A little lay down</i>

14:35.242 --> 14:37.575
Are you out of
your mind?

14:37.577 --> 14:39.344
Lucas,
you're serious, right?

14:39.346 --> 14:40.812
You can
seriously do this.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.714
Yeah. I learned
from the best, actually.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.884
-Who's the best?
-Eddie callaway.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.089
Announcer:
<i>Coming up, our main event.</i>

14:54.661 --> 14:56.160
(cheering)

14:56.162 --> 14:57.528
Why you're here, boy.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.597
Lucas, look at me.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.334
If you do this...

15:04.771 --> 15:06.437
I will
never speak to you again.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.009
-Maya.
-Riley, why are you for this?

15:11.011 --> 15:13.211
Because I want him
to succeed.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.613
I want him to make
his grandfather proud.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.615
You're not proud of him
if he doesn't do this?

15:18.618 --> 15:22.220
I think you have
a fine grasp of
the general situation, yeah.

15:22.222 --> 15:25.623
In my opinion,
it's about facing life,

15:25.625 --> 15:27.825
Which runs harder
than any bull.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.397
You gotta
face your fears.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.432
You ride them,

15:34.434 --> 15:36.367
Or they ride you.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.271
I'll never speak
to you again.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.041
Maya, what--

15:54.921 --> 15:56.387
Why would she do this?

15:56.389 --> 15:58.389
I don't know,
but I'm about to find out.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.824
Riley, I'd--

15:59.826 --> 16:01.726
I'd kinda like you
to watch.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.364
Then I will.

You can do this, lucas!
You can do anything!

16:30.523 --> 16:32.290
This bull is nothing!

16:32.292 --> 16:34.425

<i>Let's see how old tombstone</i>
<i>feels about that.</i>

16:50.877 --> 16:54.012
Lucas, tell the bull
you want to be a veterinarian!

16:54.014 --> 16:55.179
It's your only hope!

16:56.549 --> 16:58.049
I'm gonna be
a veterinarian.

16:58.051 --> 17:01.686
-(bellows angrily)
-he doesn't care!

17:01.688 --> 17:03.354
Lukey!

17:03.356 --> 17:05.056
It's me, garducky!

17:05.058 --> 17:06.858
Cletus, you gotta
get outta here.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.326
I'm gonna
distract tombstone.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.395
He gonna forget all about you
and come after me.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.330
That's my plan.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.898
Bah la la la la.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.700
(bellows angrily)

17:17.504 --> 17:20.238
Well, can't do nothin'
if he won't listen to reason.

17:21.574 --> 17:25.109

<i>Time for the moment of truth.</i>

17:26.179 --> 17:29.380

17:58.011 --> 18:01.012
Lucas! Lucas, are you okay?
Lucas, get up!

18:03.750 --> 18:06.584
I stayed on for,
like, 30 seconds.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.087
Yeah. Yeah,
I knew you could.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.267

Wanna hold onto this

I'd be honored.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.854

Hey, hold on a minute.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.020
Timmy, you did good
out there.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.488
All right,
you tried hard.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.425
Tombstone is tough,
but he is no judy the sheep.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.562
Sometimes you get thrown.

19:26.099 --> 19:27.698
Don't let it throw you.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.233
Understand me?

19:30.370 --> 19:31.736
Thanks, lucas.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.273
That was a fine ride, son.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.574
Thank you, sir.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.178
Friar.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.679
Mccullough.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.361
So he's all right.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.797
He was wonderful.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.400
How are you?

20:04.304 --> 20:06.904
I couldn't watch.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.839
I don't know why,
I just...

20:08.841 --> 20:10.107
I couldn't watch.

20:11.477 --> 20:12.777
I know why.

20:14.147 --> 20:17.148
I know that you think
I love him like a brother.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.017
You know?

20:20.019 --> 20:22.320
I know that you've
thought that for a while.

20:24.090 --> 20:27.158
Riles, whatever you feel,
that's up to you. I--

20:27.160 --> 20:28.927
Maya,

20:28.928 --> 20:30.695
It's up to you to tell me
whatever you feel.

20:30.697 --> 20:33.097
You shouldn't be afraid
to tell me anything.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.435
You're my sister,
and I've always
wanted a sister.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.503
Me too.

20:39.505 --> 20:43.140
Sisters should tell each other
their secrets, don't you think?

20:48.181 --> 20:49.847
You couldn't watch him...

20:51.384 --> 20:54.485
Because you were afraid
something would happen to him.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.458
Because you like him.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.264
You make fun of him,
because you like him.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.335
And you've never
told me that, either.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.974
Well, you're right.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.111
I love him like a brother.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.347
That's how I love him.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.559
I really do wish I grew up
with you guys, lucas.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.828
You just did, farkle.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.865
Yeah, from now on,
it's always been
the three of us.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.338
Hey lucas,
can I talk to you?

21:47.340 --> 21:49.307
Actually, I have something
to say to you, riley.

21:50.243 --> 21:53.811
If it wasn't for you,
I don't know if I would
have got on that bull,

21:53.813 --> 21:56.347
And if it wasn't for you...

21:56.349 --> 21:58.049
I don't know if I would have
survived in new york.

21:59.252 --> 22:01.152
You're really important
to me.

22:01.154 --> 22:04.188
You are really important
to me too, lucas.

22:05.191 --> 22:08.025
We've always been really good
at talking to each other,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.496
But we've never been
too good at holding hands.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.367
And then we tried
being a couple

22:16.369 --> 22:18.869
And we couldn't even
talk to each other.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.338
I don't want that.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.876
I want to know you're
always there to talk to.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.347
You're my brother, lucas,

22:29.349 --> 22:31.716
And I'm your sister.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.651
That's what you
think we are?

22:33.653 --> 22:35.419
That's what
I think we are.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.261
I love you, lucas,
