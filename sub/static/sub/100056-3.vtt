WEBVTT

00:09.096 --> 00:11.228
Something big is going on,
I know it.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.664
Are they gossiping?

00:12.708 --> 00:14.318
Is it about that
jerk in Pediatrics

00:14.362 --> 00:16.320
that yelled at a really
nice girl named Lexie?

00:17.365 --> 00:19.323
Doubtful. Oh!

00:19.367 --> 00:20.779
Maybe Mrs. Dempsey
woke up from her coma.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.302
Well, if that's the case,
we'll have to pool

00:22.326 --> 00:24.633
our knowledge to catch her up
on the last year.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.591
I'll take arts and literature.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.637
Lexie, you take reality TV.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.334
Ooh, docuseries and competition?

00:30.378 --> 00:32.336
I'm on it.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.642
Guys, it's not Mrs. Dempsey.

00:33.685 --> 00:36.036
If it is, obviously,
I'd take health and beauty.

00:37.341 --> 00:39.430
But I think it might be a zebra.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.476
A zebra? Ooh.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.695
That'd be awesome.
I don't know.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.481
Zebras appear cute, but
they're notorious kickers.

00:46.524 --> 00:49.571
No, no, no, Caleb,
"zebra" as in a nickname

00:49.614 --> 00:52.791
for a patient with
an extremely rare condition.

00:52.835 --> 00:53.792
You know that old saying,

00:53.836 --> 00:54.880
if you hear hooves coming,

00:54.924 --> 00:56.032
you can assume it's a horse,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.145
but every once in a while,
it's a zebra.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.670
So? Do they have a diagnosis?

01:01.713 --> 01:02.932
What are the signs? Symptoms?

01:02.975 --> 01:04.325
Well, a headache

01:04.367 --> 01:06.457
is something
you're giving me right now.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.591
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:09.634 --> 01:11.114
I have some intriguing news.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.116
It seems that here today

01:13.160 --> 01:14.596
we may have a zebra.

01:14.639 --> 01:15.771
Ooh!
Yes!

01:15.814 --> 01:17.164
A probablezebra.

01:17.207 --> 01:19.122
Yes. Yes, thank you,
Dr. Jacobs.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.647
This could be...

01:22.691 --> 01:25.346
a career-defining experience.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.043
Let's be professional.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.131
Don't get your hopes up.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.613
Oh, who am I kidding?
I'm fired up!

01:32.614 --> 01:33.852
Usually it's
pneumonia, pneumonia,

01:33.876 --> 01:36.444
pneumonia, but not today!

01:38.141 --> 01:40.100
â™ª

01:46.932 --> 01:48.891
All right, everyone,
patient is Margaret Hamden.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.197
Female, age 40.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.894
Admitted with symptoms
of meningitis

01:51.937 --> 01:54.375
but has since developed
physiologic tremors

01:54.418 --> 01:56.768
and unexplained
abdominal cramps.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.074
Finally, someone's taking

01:58.118 --> 02:00.772
a woman's cramps seriously.
Am I right?

02:00.816 --> 02:03.079
Where my ladies at?

02:04.820 --> 02:06.865
Sorry.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.606
I want you all to study up

02:08.650 --> 02:10.695
and get ready
to present theories.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.523
Already have four. Five.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.308
Ten.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.919
If our patient does indeed
turn out to be a zebra,

02:16.962 --> 02:18.703
Dr. Frost and I

02:18.747 --> 02:20.705
will choose one of you
to assist us in treatment

02:20.749 --> 02:23.926
and write up the case
for publication in a journal.

02:23.969 --> 02:25.797
Oh,
I've already published twice,

02:25.841 --> 02:27.059
so I can definitely handle it.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.410
Daniel's not the only one

02:29.453 --> 02:30.759
that's been published.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.935
I wrote a very successful
advice column

02:32.978 --> 02:34.719
in our school's science journal.

02:34.763 --> 02:37.896
My nom de plume was Pipette.

02:37.940 --> 02:40.334
Just to throw my
hat in the ring,

02:40.377 --> 02:42.379
I have traveled
to many countries

02:42.423 --> 02:44.512
where I've both
treated and contracted

02:44.555 --> 02:46.688
a number of rare diseases.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.386
Word of advice?
When the locals say

02:49.430 --> 02:52.955
don't let a chicken
in your tent, listen.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.739
Dr. Jacobs.

02:54.783 --> 02:55.784
A word?

02:55.827 --> 02:57.960
Before I go, I need someone

02:58.003 --> 03:00.571
to take the lead
on the new admit in 510.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.158
Just to check, the person
who takes this new admit

03:02.182 --> 03:04.029
will not be in the running
to work on the zebra?

03:04.053 --> 03:06.142
Correct.
Uh, and therefore
will not be eligible

03:06.186 --> 03:07.883
to publish the case? That's right.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.928
A-And this new patient
has something cool

03:09.972 --> 03:11.713
or...?
The flu.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.849
Thanks for volunteering,
Dr. Kenney.

03:17.893 --> 03:18.894
Oh.

03:18.937 --> 03:21.636
What the heck, you guys?

03:21.679 --> 03:23.986
You know I love
a medical mystery.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.857
Or any mystery. Murder?

03:25.901 --> 03:27.076
Yes. Murder on a train?

03:27.119 --> 03:28.730
Yes, of course. Murder in a castle?

03:28.773 --> 03:30.862
That's my fa...
Stop distracting me.

03:32.168 --> 03:35.127
What you just did was terrible.

03:35.171 --> 03:37.260
I deserved a shot at the zebra.

03:37.304 --> 03:40.089
Sorry, Carol.
Sometimes medicine isn't fair.

03:40.132 --> 03:41.873
Really?

03:41.917 --> 03:43.875
And you two weasels agree
with this?

03:43.919 --> 03:47.227
Yes, because it serves
my immediate self-interest.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.075
I'm sorry, Carol,
but if I can publish,

03:50.099 --> 03:51.753
maybe I'll be known
as something other

03:51.796 --> 03:54.016
than Dr. Frost's former
pickleball partner.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.932
I should not have revealed that.

03:56.975 --> 03:59.064
Pickleball, cornhole.

03:59.108 --> 04:01.893
White people games are wild.

04:01.937 --> 04:04.722
I would never have expected
this kind

04:04.766 --> 04:07.508
of self-centered thinking
from... two of you.

04:10.206 --> 04:11.947
Being a doctor is not
about personal glory.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.210
We are a team.
A win for one of us

04:14.254 --> 04:15.951
is a win for all of us. DANIEL:
Hmm.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.320
Perfect.
When I publish my article,

04:17.344 --> 04:18.664
I'll make sure
to acknowledge you.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.957
Not inthe journal, obvi.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.960
In a later Instagram post.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.832
You know, whatever.
I'll bet my patient

04:27.876 --> 04:31.358
has some sort of really cool,
exotic bird flu.

04:31.401 --> 04:34.317
"Patient showing symptoms
of the common flu."

04:34.361 --> 04:35.884
Don't read my chart.

04:40.105 --> 04:41.455
What do you think you're doing?

04:41.498 --> 04:43.326
My scrubs?

04:43.370 --> 04:45.086
See, I thought if I tucked
the top into the pants,

04:45.110 --> 04:46.914
it might give 'em more
of a fitted, fashiony look.

04:46.938 --> 04:49.463
No.

04:49.506 --> 04:53.293
What are you doing eating
my blueberry muffin?

04:53.336 --> 04:56.470
Oh, th-this muffin
is your muffin?

04:56.513 --> 04:57.862
I-I didn't know.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.124
I'm sorry. I-I...

04:59.168 --> 05:01.083
It wa... it was
right by the apples.

05:01.126 --> 05:03.085
Dennis didn't tell me
it was yours.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.260
It's hisfault.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.001
Excuse me?

05:06.044 --> 05:08.743
Just 'cause you're drowning,
don't drag me in the pool.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.573
Would you, uh, would you like
an apple instead?

05:12.616 --> 05:14.202
Honestly, muffins
aren't even that good for you.

05:14.226 --> 05:18.187
A blueberry muffin is
my Wednesday treat.

05:19.231 --> 05:21.408
Totally. Apple was a bad idea.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.584
I will replace
this muffin for you.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.369
As soon as we
figure out the zebra.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.023
Or now. Perfect. I'll go now.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.336
I mean, would I prefer to work

05:36.379 --> 05:38.338
on a rare,
interesting illness? Sure.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.949
Do I feel betrayed
by my best friends? You bet.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.212
Is it too soon
to call them my best friends?

05:43.255 --> 05:45.083
I am starting to think so.

05:46.171 --> 05:47.999
But then I remember

05:48.043 --> 05:51.960
that each individual patient
is fascinating in his own way.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.919
Have you seen
Driving Miss Daisy?

05:59.489 --> 06:02.187
I-It's about a black man

06:02.231 --> 06:04.364
who has to tolerate
an old white lady.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.850
Hello, Mr. Lewis.
I'm Dr. Kenney.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.113
So, what seems to
be bothering you?

06:15.157 --> 06:18.116
And, please,
spare no gory detail.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.728
Well, I guess to start,
I'd have to say my head hurts

06:20.771 --> 06:23.905
and I have a stomachache
and... yep.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.472
That's about it.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.390
Fascinating.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.483
The cafeteria sold out
of blueberry muffins.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.574
Wow, I can't wait to watch
the movie based on this.

06:41.531 --> 06:42.924
If you're hungry, I have a bowl

06:42.967 --> 06:44.708
of vegan chili in my locker.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.231
Aah, you guys are no help!

06:47.755 --> 06:49.713
I always assumed
residency would break one of us,

06:49.757 --> 06:52.020
but, honestly,
I had my money on me.

06:53.108 --> 06:55.763
Hey, I know we both want this,

06:55.806 --> 06:57.958
but you're not gonna use
your relationship with Dr. Frost

06:57.982 --> 06:59.680
to get picked for the zebra,
are you?

06:59.723 --> 07:02.117
Of course not.
We'll compete on medicine alone.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.293
So no country club shenanigans?

07:04.336 --> 07:05.729
The Irish have shenanigans.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.601
Country clubs have ballyhoo.

07:11.039 --> 07:14.999
Dr. Gilani.
Dr. Sommers.

07:15.043 --> 07:18.046
The zebra hunt continues.

07:18.089 --> 07:21.005
Perhaps you two could
contribute your thoughts

07:21.049 --> 07:22.485
to Mrs. Hamden's scans.

07:22.529 --> 07:26.663
Well, uh, the MRI shows
minimal meningeal enhancement,

07:26.707 --> 07:28.424
so the patient's symptoms
are unlikely to be

07:28.448 --> 07:29.666
meningitis-related.

07:29.710 --> 07:30.885
Spot-on. What else?

07:30.928 --> 07:32.234
Uh...

07:32.277 --> 07:35.237
Oh, I am seeing some
enlargement of the liver.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.021
We might want to test
copper levels

07:37.065 --> 07:38.129
to rule out Wilson's Disease.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.937
Excellent observations,
Dr. Gilani.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.026
But what Dr. Gilani missed

07:42.070 --> 07:44.246
was this region
of discoloration.

07:44.289 --> 07:47.510
Appears to be damaged tissue.
Possibly pulmonary fibrosis.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.643
Good instincts, Dr. Sommers.

07:49.686 --> 07:52.080
However, on closer examination,

07:52.123 --> 07:54.822
that appears to be a thumbprint.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.737
Excuse me?

07:56.780 --> 08:00.175
The scan tech was mid-burrito.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.525
I suspect that's less
pulmonary fibrosis,

08:02.569 --> 08:04.222
more pico de gallo.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.531
What an embarrassing and
disqualifying mistake

08:08.575 --> 08:09.706
to have made.

08:11.186 --> 08:14.319
Caleb, you know what
that reminds me of?

08:14.363 --> 08:17.105
That time your father and I
were about to compete

08:17.148 --> 08:19.324
for the Southampton
tennis championship.

08:19.368 --> 08:22.545
Oh, uh, no,
I-I don't remember that.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.242
What? Of course you do.

08:24.286 --> 08:27.158
I spilled gazpacho
all over my whites.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.660
You know, I did have
one more thought on that liver.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.052
I'm interested. Uh, y-you know what?

08:32.076 --> 08:33.948
It just came back to me.

08:33.991 --> 08:37.212
I-I do remember telling you
not to eat in your whites.

08:37.255 --> 08:40.868
But if I know Dr. Stephen Frost,
he can't resist a cold soup

08:40.910 --> 08:43.304
on a hot day.

08:43.347 --> 08:45.133
That's right.

08:45.176 --> 08:48.484
He can't!

08:48.528 --> 08:51.182
I-I never spilled soup
in the Hamptons,

08:51.226 --> 08:53.184
but I did spill red wine
in the bathtub

08:53.228 --> 08:54.359
at a Hampton Inn.
Hmm.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.231
Uh, I still drank it.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.278
Dr. Sommers, come with me.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.368
We'll run a test
for copper levels.

09:03.412 --> 09:06.110
On it.

09:06.154 --> 09:10.071
Okay, sir, your IV is
successfully inserted.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.681
And they say treating the flu

09:11.725 --> 09:13.465
isn't as interesting
as some rare disease.

09:13.509 --> 09:16.773
As if.
I love the flu.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.167
I don't know, I might be
too close to it.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.996
Let's just check your vitals.

09:22.039 --> 09:24.520
Blood pressure 120/70.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.131
That's extremely interesting. Really?

09:27.175 --> 09:28.524
In as much as how normal it is.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.936
I mean, people aren't
gonna be talking about it

09:29.960 --> 09:32.310
around the water cooler,
but I don't know, I like it.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.227
Gary...

09:36.271 --> 09:38.926
how long have you had
these spots on your hands?

09:38.969 --> 09:40.754
I don't know.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.973
Huh. That's interesting.

09:43.017 --> 09:45.323
Like normalinteresting,

09:45.367 --> 09:47.325
or interestinginteresting?

09:47.369 --> 09:49.545
Have you had any
bug bites recently?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.416
A few, when I went camping.

09:53.418 --> 09:56.987
Oh, and more spots
on your ankles.

09:57.031 --> 10:00.425
Oh, Gary, now we're talking.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.341
Dr. Jacobs, look
what I found.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.256
I am ready to get back
on that zebra.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.257
What is that?

10:06.301 --> 10:08.738
It looks like it has smallpox.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.348
Very astute eyes, Dr. Jacobs,

10:10.392 --> 10:13.830
but, no, those are
cranberries. Cranberries?

10:13.874 --> 10:15.155
The cafeteria was out
of blueberry,

10:15.179 --> 10:17.312
but this one's a bran base
with cranberries.

10:17.355 --> 10:19.706
It's a... cran-bran.

10:19.749 --> 10:22.056
A cran-bran?

10:23.013 --> 10:24.232
I'm impressed.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.409
You managed to find a muffin

10:27.452 --> 10:30.194
that's actually worse
than no muffin.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.198
What is the deal
with this muffin?

10:34.242 --> 10:35.852
Loud and clear.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.202
I did have a backup plan.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.248
If I could just
jam these bluebies

10:40.291 --> 10:43.860
into this regular muffin
without smushing 'em...

10:43.904 --> 10:45.993
You know what.
I'll just toss this one myself.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.432
Lexie, I'm sorry.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.739
I'm not proud that I used
my connection with Dr. Frost,

10:52.782 --> 10:57.091
but if I can say one thing
in my defense... I panicked.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.243
When he picks you to assist
with the zebra, just remember

10:59.267 --> 11:02.270
you are a card-carrying
member of the patriarchy.

11:02.313 --> 11:04.272
All right, listen up, you two.

11:04.315 --> 11:07.754
Unfortunately, I have
some bad news about Mrs. Hamden.

11:07.797 --> 11:10.408
She's not a zebra.Oh.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.454
Turns out it's meningitis.

11:12.497 --> 11:15.500
Just regular, vanilla,
viralmeningitis.

11:15.544 --> 11:18.068
The cramping and tremors
were nicotine withdrawal.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.591
She lied about being a smoker.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.550
Ugh. A liar
anda smoker?

11:21.593 --> 11:24.727
Who is this lady, my stepmom?

11:24.771 --> 11:27.338
Look, I know we were all excited
about the zebra.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.732
And I may not be around
for the next one,

11:29.776 --> 11:33.997
so I want you youngsters,
always remember...

11:34.041 --> 11:35.825
Ooh, fresh pot of coffee.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.003
Mm.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.744
Good news is, you didn't win.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.572
The bad news is, neither did I.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.487
Yeah. Maybe
it's for the best.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.228
I mean, Carol was right.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.621
Medicine should not be about
your own personal glory.

11:49.665 --> 11:53.147
Listen up,
ordinary boring doctors.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.805
Test results
from my "flu patient" came in.

11:58.848 --> 12:02.373
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mama's got a zebra!

12:09.946 --> 12:11.382
Welcome, everyone.
This is Gary,

12:11.426 --> 12:13.863
or as I like to call him,
Carol's medical miracle.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.473
Miracle? I'm cured?

12:15.517 --> 12:16.797
Gary, don't be rude.
I'm talking.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.870
Now, I first noticed
these unique spots

12:20.914 --> 12:23.046
on Gary's wrists and ankles.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.092
Let's see those tootsies,
Gare Bear.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.616
And, you know, another doctor

12:27.659 --> 12:29.052
might have brushed off his rash

12:29.096 --> 12:30.967
as eczema or psoriasis.

12:31.011 --> 12:34.405
However,
a thorough examination led me

12:34.449 --> 12:38.975
to what I'm calling the keystone
of my diagnosis.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.152
Tell us!

12:44.154 --> 12:45.895
His recent camping trip.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.679
Ah.It made me suspect

12:47.723 --> 12:49.507
an insect-borne disease.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.771
Now, tick-borne illnesses
are notoriously difficult

12:51.814 --> 12:52.902
to differentiate.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.774
The worst.Yes.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.254
Yeah.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.145
Conventional wisdom would
dictate that we go straight

12:59.169 --> 13:01.128
to the Western blot test,
but in the absence

13:01.171 --> 13:03.347
of the distinctive
Erythema Migrans rash,

13:03.391 --> 13:05.654
I immediately tested
for Rickettsia rickettsii.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.787
And, guys, I nailed it.

13:11.138 --> 13:13.096
Gary has a case

13:13.140 --> 13:14.924
of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.447
Ah.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.014
Oh!

13:18.058 --> 13:20.843
Thank you.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.976
We expect a full recovery.

13:23.019 --> 13:25.195
Obviously,
this illness is extremely rare.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.023
There are probably
more actual zebras

13:27.067 --> 13:30.026
in Southern California
than cases like this.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.637
Usually I'd discourage

13:32.681 --> 13:35.684
that kind of glib
wordplay, but...

13:35.727 --> 13:37.947
this zebra is
pretty exciting. No kidding.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.601
Dr. Kenney, would you like

13:39.644 --> 13:41.231
the assistance of either
of your fellow interns

13:41.255 --> 13:42.952
to monitor treatment?

13:42.996 --> 13:44.345
I'm generally pleasant

13:44.388 --> 13:46.068
and willing to be a beta,
so maybe pick me?

13:47.217 --> 13:49.002
Or keep in mind who
always helps you

13:49.045 --> 13:50.960
connect to the printer.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.049
Ah.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.573
Such a difficult decision.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.140
Who should I take with me

13:57.184 --> 13:59.708
on this medical journey
of a lifetime?

14:01.014 --> 14:02.450
You know what?
I couldn't possibly

14:02.493 --> 14:04.669
take either of you away
from your regular patients.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.497
Oh, th-they won't miss us.

14:06.541 --> 14:09.674
Someone once told me...
And he was right...

14:09.718 --> 14:12.895
Sometimes
medicine just isn't fair.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.593
It's a personal goal

14:15.637 --> 14:18.770
to never know the context
of this. Let's move.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.122
Sorry it didn't work out.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.169
I'm not sorry.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.172
Listen, Dennis,

14:29.216 --> 14:31.479
you seem to know how to
get things around here.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.196
Now, I know we're not
exactly best friends...

14:33.220 --> 14:34.743
Whoa.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.179
Where is this coming from?

14:37.746 --> 14:39.530
I consider us
pretty good friends.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.619
Yo, for real?

14:41.663 --> 14:44.231
That's so great to
hear, especially...

14:46.450 --> 14:48.496
Okay, not nice.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.802
Look, Dr. Jacobs holds
my professional future

14:50.846 --> 14:52.500
in her muffin-less hands.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.154
The only way I can
placate her is

14:54.197 --> 14:56.808
to get her a cafeteria
blueberry muffin.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.201
Now, can you help me?

14:58.245 --> 15:00.812
Easy.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.250
And I don't have to do
anything weird for it?

15:10.257 --> 15:13.086
So now I have to think about
which medical journal to target.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.001
Obviously, you have
your New England, which is,

15:15.044 --> 15:17.307
you know,
your Harvard of journals.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.657
But maybe I go indie?

15:19.701 --> 15:21.505
I don't know, I've heard there's
some pretty cool journals

15:21.529 --> 15:23.183
coming out of Portland
these days.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.273
Hey, Carol. Didn't realize

15:26.316 --> 15:28.101
there'd be a line
for the meet-and-greet.

15:29.885 --> 15:33.236
Hi. Guys, this is Dr. Gilani
and Dr. Sommers.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.240
They crushed it today
on their meningitis patient.

15:35.282 --> 15:39.068
Bacterial? No, no, standard viral.
Pretty basic, but they're good.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.246
Anyway, can you give us
a minute?

15:43.290 --> 15:45.335
I got to give these cuties
a little face time.

15:48.295 --> 15:50.253
Oh, my gosh.
Sorry about that.

15:50.297 --> 15:53.256
They were just all
congratulating me on the zebra.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.085
I don't know,
it's kind of embarrassing.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.087
Carol, I don't mean to be harsh,

15:58.131 --> 16:00.571
but with all this grandstanding,
you're acting like a surgeon.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.441
Yeah, I would expect
this kind of behavior

16:04.485 --> 16:08.097
from Daniel, but you, Carol?
What a shame.

16:08.141 --> 16:11.187
So, are you guys mad?

16:11.231 --> 16:13.276
It's just,
you're the one who said

16:13.320 --> 16:15.539
you were all about teamwork
over personal glory.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.802
But then you didn't
share your zebra.

16:17.846 --> 16:21.371
Oh. So I guess
what's happening here

16:21.415 --> 16:22.895
is, you're jealous
because I'm getting

16:22.938 --> 16:24.244
all the praise and attention

16:24.287 --> 16:25.897
that you tried to steal from me.

16:25.941 --> 16:28.552
Well, you certainly seem
to be enjoying the spotlight.

16:28.596 --> 16:31.077
I am. I'm loving it.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.427
I haven't spent much
time in the spotlight,

16:33.470 --> 16:35.559
'cause you know who doesn't
get enough attention?

16:35.603 --> 16:37.431
Moms. And teachers.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.259
And people
who run small bookstores.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.564
I'm not that third thing,

16:40.608 --> 16:42.168
but I think
they deserve more attention.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.700
What is it?

16:45.743 --> 16:47.310
My patient. He's crashing.

16:48.703 --> 16:49.921
We're coming with you.

16:52.663 --> 16:55.797
Hives. I think he's allergic
to the doxycycline.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.384
Okay, everybody, he's in anaphylactic
shock. Tell us what you need.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.193
Start a new IV,
bolus him with saline. On it.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.803
Dr. Sommers,
you need to intubate

17:01.846 --> 17:03.389
before we lose the airways.
No sedatives.

17:03.413 --> 17:04.912
We don't want to risk paralysis
of the throat muscles.

17:04.935 --> 17:07.156
You got it. Nurse, I need one of epi.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.375
IV's in.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.378
Patient is stabilizing.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.357
All right, keep bagging him.
Let's get him to the ICU.

17:14.381 --> 17:15.772
Great work, team.

17:17.210 --> 17:20.169
Now, I give you this muffin,

17:20.213 --> 17:23.520
you meet me outside
the men's room at 5:30 p.m.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.306
I'm not just
agreeing to whatever...

17:26.348 --> 17:28.525
Mmm...
Okay, fine, I'll
see you at 5:30.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.223
Dr. Jacobs.

17:34.227 --> 17:37.230
Thank you, Dr. Kutcher.
As you were.

17:39.275 --> 17:41.060
What?! That's it?

17:41.103 --> 17:42.409
I-I-I have to know.

17:42.452 --> 17:43.995
Wha-What is so special
about this muffin?

17:44.019 --> 17:46.935
Please.
Dr. Kutcher...

17:46.978 --> 17:48.154
medicine is not a field

17:48.197 --> 17:49.938
where one has a lot of control.

17:49.981 --> 17:53.376
I rarely know what will happen
from one hour to the next.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.552
But no matter who
dies or who lives

17:55.596 --> 17:58.338
or who vomits in my hair,

17:58.381 --> 18:01.123
every Wednesday morning I enjoy

18:01.167 --> 18:03.343
a cafeteria blueberry muffin.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.388
It's my anchor.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.434
In a sea of unpredictability,

18:07.477 --> 18:10.350
it's the one thing
I can depend on.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.526
I suggest you find one.

18:12.569 --> 18:15.311
Thank you.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.226
That's very wise.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.272
Maybe my anchor is you.
Your advice is...

18:19.315 --> 18:21.404
Go get me some milk!
Okay.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.713
Carol, you were
amazing in there.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.497
You were like a general

18:27.541 --> 18:28.542
or a quarterback

18:28.585 --> 18:31.284
or a mom at a pool
with three kids.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.480
I mean, I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

18:34.504 --> 18:36.463
And I'm sorry I waited
till a real emergency

18:36.506 --> 18:38.291
to let you help me out
with the zebra.

18:38.334 --> 18:41.120
Oh, come on, Carol,
we always got your back.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.773
I mean, not this morning,
obviously.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.471
Threw you under the bus
pretty hard.

18:44.514 --> 18:45.776
But, uh, almost always.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.345
Excellent work, Dr. Kenney.

18:49.389 --> 18:50.709
Now, go find yourself
a typewriter

18:50.738 --> 18:52.783
because you've got
an article to write.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.483
Hey, Dr. Frost, would it be okay

18:56.526 --> 18:58.659
if the three of us
wrote up the article together?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.313
As co-authors?

19:00.356 --> 19:02.576
I mean, I'll be
the first name, obvi.

19:02.619 --> 19:05.100
Then me, obvi.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.537
And then Dr. Jacobs,
then some other people,

19:07.581 --> 19:09.191
and then you guys.

19:09.235 --> 19:12.194
And I'll acknowledge Daniel
in a later Instagram post.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.630
Excellent plan.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.764
Are you even on Instagram?

19:16.807 --> 19:18.026
Yeah, she is.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.028
She has four
followers, zero posts,

19:20.071 --> 19:21.464
and her account is private.

19:21.508 --> 19:24.424
And I forgot my password.

19:30.691 --> 19:34.825
And here we have another snake.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.960
Seriously.

19:39.003 --> 19:41.702
I don't think these teenagers
really like having a clown.

19:41.745 --> 19:44.487
Yeah, doesn't look like it.

19:44.531 --> 19:45.923
Seems a bit young for them.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.882
Then why do you hire clowns?

19:47.925 --> 19:49.144
Oh, we don't.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.755
So I'm not filling in
for anybody? No.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.104
Then what am I doing here?

19:53.148 --> 19:57.500
Oh, this is just for me.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.023
Damn it, Dennis!

20:00.982 --> 20:03.941
Daniel, oh, are you a clown?

20:03.985 --> 20:05.682
Yes. Long story.

20:05.726 --> 20:06.727
Who got the zebra?

20:06.770 --> 20:08.946
Carol did, but we got to help.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.165
Great. Everyone but me.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.340
