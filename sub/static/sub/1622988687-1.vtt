00:00.916 --> 00:02.416
(film projector)

00:31.416 --> 00:34.416
(eery music)

00:38.666 --> 00:41.666
(girls laughing)

00:42.625 --> 00:44.041
I'll be right back.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.500
(cougar growl)

01:32.416 --> 01:33.791
(cougar growling)

02:04.208 --> 02:05.916
(cougar attacking)

02:05.916 --> 02:08.916
(girl screaming)

02:09.375 --> 02:12.375
(cougar growling)

02:22.083 --> 02:25.083
(calming music)

03:39.291 --> 03:42.291
Do you remember that phase that jack went trough?

03:42.583 --> 03:45.583
When he literally would take

03:45.583 --> 03:48.583
everything out of his bins.

03:48.875 --> 03:51.875
And toy area, and set it up all over the house.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.250
Yeah.
Yeah.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.833
I talked to Ashley the other day

03:55.833 --> 03:57.583
and Connor's one hundred percent in that phase.

03:57.583 --> 03:58.833
Oh! That's tough.

03:58.833 --> 04:03.208
She is dying. She's like, I need to be around people that I
can talk to,

04:03.208 --> 04:06.208
and not have to... I mean, she's done.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.541
She's got to get away.

04:08.541 --> 04:10.458
Alright.
What can we do?

04:12.541 --> 04:14.750
And, we have to bring David.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.750
Alright. He's funny, he's funny.
He is.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.416
He doesn't work much.

04:20.416 --> 04:23.250
But he's funny.
Then why do you still have him work for you?

04:23.250 --> 04:24.541
Because he's funny.

04:24.832 --> 04:25.582
Comedy relief.

04:25.582 --> 04:27.250
He's a good guy.
Yeah, he is.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.582
No, we like him.

04:29.582 --> 04:32.375
But what can we-
Only becuase he's funny.

04:32.375 --> 04:35.375
That's the only reason Ashley likes him too.
True.

04:37.082 --> 04:40.082
Um, I don't know. Bring them here.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.207
Do you think they'd make it?

04:42.332 --> 04:45.332
I mean it's so pretty, but I don't know.

04:47.541 --> 04:50.125
Justdon't tell them.

04:50.125 --> 04:51.500
Okay.
Yeah.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.000
Just tell them we'll go camping or something,

04:55.000 --> 04:56.541
but don't tell them where.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.916
Or that they have to walk a lot.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.750
Yeah.

05:04.291 --> 05:07.291
What about Chad?

05:08.041 --> 05:09.541
I haven't seen Chad in so long.

05:09.541 --> 05:11.958
I know. We should get him out of the bar.

05:11.958 --> 05:14.458
Is he still there all the time?
All the time.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.250
I haven't seen him in a long time either.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.457
He's supposed to be my best friend.

05:17.457 --> 05:18.791
We need to go.

05:19.875 --> 05:20.791
And Becky?

05:20.791 --> 05:24.625
I see her, just not in person.

05:24.832 --> 05:27.832
Yeah, you see her alright. Influencer!

05:28.707 --> 05:30.750
I still don't know what that is.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.125
Aren't you an influencer?
No.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.125
You influence me all the time. For bad things.
That's my job.

05:38.916 --> 05:42.916
No, ask him. He probably needs to come out more than Ashley.

05:43.541 --> 05:45.291
True. Yeah, I'll ask him.

05:45.291 --> 05:46.916
Does he like to hike?

05:46.916 --> 05:49.916
Eh, he goes outdoors. I mean, he won't mind it.

05:51.082 --> 05:54.082
Hopefully he's in shape.
I don't know, bar shape is different.

05:55.207 --> 05:57.666
I know he doesn't do much else.

05:57.666 --> 06:00.666
Doesn't matter. We won't tell them where.
We'll just tell them camping.

06:01.666 --> 06:04.208
Because they should see this.
Maybe they'll get out more.

06:04.208 --> 06:05.958
Yeah.

06:06.750 --> 06:09.750
We'll ask them. I'll tell Ashley.

06:11.083 --> 06:11.916
It's a deal.

06:13.833 --> 06:15.291
Okay.
Let's go.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.291
Good.
Ready?

06:17.291 --> 06:18.166
Great.
You hungry?

06:18.166 --> 06:19.082
Hungry.
Now?

06:19.082 --> 06:19.832
Let's go.

06:23.375 --> 06:26.375
(upbeat blues music)

06:29.207 --> 06:29.750
(camcorder clicking)

06:43.666 --> 06:45.207
The Karate Kid!

06:47.500 --> 06:49.250
Kai is following us!

07:21.500 --> 07:23.625
Dana. This was a really good idea.

07:26.707 --> 07:29.625
I can't take all the credit.
Jack had a little to do with it.

07:29.625 --> 07:30.957
Yes I did.

07:32.707 --> 07:35.375
It kind of reminds me of like old days though.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.457
Sneaking away for a couple days.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.457
But we don't have to worry about my parents finding out that
we're not really at Jennifer's.

07:41.416 --> 07:42.125
Right!

07:43.375 --> 07:44.875
How did Connor take it?

07:45.916 --> 07:48.500
Poor baby. He like wouldn't even let us leave the door.

07:48.791 --> 07:51.000
He was blocking it.
He didn't want us to put our bags in the car.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.166
But then Grandma showed up with donuts,
and he was like shooing us out.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.291
He was kicking us out basically.

07:56.291 --> 07:57.916
That's just like Jack Jr.

07:57.916 --> 08:00.916
You know who's reallly excited to brave the outdoors?

08:01.541 --> 08:02.500
Becky.

08:03.666 --> 08:06.666
She can't wait to get dirty, and eat out of a can.

08:07.083 --> 08:08.541
Hey Becky. Can you hear me?

08:09.291 --> 08:10.000
What?

08:10.625 --> 08:12.375
Go ahead. Get some more followers on Insta.

08:12.916 --> 08:13.750
Shut up.

08:14.750 --> 08:15.666
That's terrible.

08:16.082 --> 08:17.625
Take a look at Chad.

08:19.250 --> 08:20.625
That poor guy.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.291
He hasn't had a break since he opened that bar.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.041
How long has it been?

08:26.750 --> 08:27.875
8 years?

08:28.457 --> 08:30.041
70, 80 hours a week.

08:31.416 --> 08:32.375
Poor guy.

08:32.957 --> 08:34.125
You're a good friend.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.500
I'm the best friend.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.457
Take a look at that

08:50.583 --> 08:53.583
We still have another two hours to go.

08:54.208 --> 08:54.833
Two hours?

08:55.540 --> 08:57.458
Look how pretty the sky is.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
(upbeat blues music)

09:21.208 --> 09:22.750
Did we forget something?

09:22.750 --> 09:28.791
No. I want to talk to the locals, and see if there is
anything we should know before we head out there.

09:29.666 --> 09:30.791
Good idea.

09:33.290 --> 09:34.708
Ah, sporting goods?

09:35.625 --> 09:36.915
Wanna get some beef jerkey.

09:37.625 --> 09:40.625
You already packed all of your beef jerkey.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.040
Can't have enough beef jerkey.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.208
Right Jack?

09:43.208 --> 09:45.915
That is right, not enough, ever!

09:49.750 --> 09:50.583
Are you coming?

09:54.540 --> 09:54.875
Yeah.

09:55.790 --> 09:56.708
Oh, you're awake.

09:57.915 --> 09:58.375
Good morning.

10:00.583 --> 10:01.250
Good morning Chad.

10:02.833 --> 10:03.333
Hey.

10:03.958 --> 10:05.458
You can't take these guys anywhere.

10:08.208 --> 10:08.625
(bell chiming)

10:14.166 --> 10:17.166
You look beautiful...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

10:17.166 --> 10:17.458
How about this?

10:17.625 --> 10:19.083
What are we doing? Oh!

10:20.041 --> 10:21.541
It's pretty.
You want one of those?

10:21.541 --> 10:22.666
Kind of.
Oh, a mountain lion?

10:22.666 --> 10:23.625
Wow!

10:24.208 --> 10:26.375
This place is cool man!
Check it out.

10:28.333 --> 10:28.833
Whoa!

10:29.625 --> 10:30.500
You got it.

10:34.625 --> 10:35.625
Hey ma.

10:37.165 --> 10:40.165
Thanks a lot for inviting us.
No, thank you for coming,

10:40.165 --> 10:42.665
I know how hard it is for you guys to get away.

10:42.665 --> 10:47.290
Yeah. I, I...
I really needed this.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.458
I swear that place is gonna kill me.

10:49.458 --> 10:52.458
It is gonna kill ya.
Those 17 hour days.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.040
So... How are you?

10:58.290 --> 11:00.583
No complaints man, I'm doing great.

11:00.583 --> 11:01.458
Kids?

11:01.458 --> 11:04.458
Dana's great, the kids are great.
Good.

11:04.958 --> 11:06.291
You want one?

11:06.291 --> 11:07.208
Kids?

11:11.375 --> 11:14.375
I already have my hands full.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.750
Lord have mercy. Come on man.

11:29.708 --> 11:32.708
Wait a minute. What do we have here?

11:33.333 --> 11:36.333
Finally somebody worth my attention.

11:38.208 --> 11:41.208
Mamacitas, little chicas.

11:41.790 --> 11:44.290
Crisiva devichski

11:45.415 --> 11:48.415
Little lolitas, oh yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.915
Wow, that one.

11:54.708 --> 11:55.958
Yeah!

12:04.000 --> 12:05.708
Is anybody even here?

12:07.375 --> 12:10.375
Like a clerk?

12:33.583 --> 12:37.708
Hey Ashley! He's cuter than you are.

12:43.625 --> 12:44.875
Excuse me!

12:47.875 --> 12:52.500
I'm sorry young folks. All my help
called in sick today, I'm here by myself.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.875
Oh, it's alright.
It's fine.

12:53.875 --> 12:56.875
Oh, you got ladies with you. We don't usually get such
pretty ladies in here.

12:57.665 --> 12:59.750
We got a couple of them, that's for sure.
Special day!

12:59.750 --> 13:01.625
So, how can I help you guys?

13:01.625 --> 13:03.375
Yeah, we're headed up to big cat trail.

13:03.375 --> 13:06.375
And a couple of these ladies are first time hikers.

13:06.375 --> 13:08.833
Really?
Kind of show them-

13:08.833 --> 13:11.833
It wouldn't be my first choice to take hiker.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.916
I mean, it can be treacherous.
Treacherous?

13:14.916 --> 13:17.583
there's some legends here, I mean

13:17.583 --> 13:20.458
Sedona has their vortexes,

13:20.458 --> 13:23.000
But we got some crazy shit out there.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.291
I mean, you go way back to the 60s, cattle mutilations.

13:26.833 --> 13:30.875
Remember reading about that? They found cattle with their
eyballs cut out, their buttholes cut out.

13:31.666 --> 13:33.875
Stuff like that.
We're just gling for a hike.

13:33.875 --> 13:36.875
I mean, skunk apes. You know what that is?

13:36.875 --> 13:39.750
You watch TV?
Yeah, Yeah.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.750
It looks like a sasquatch. It's like sasquatch's little
brother.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Down in Florida there's legends. Well they've been spotted
up here too.

13:46.915 --> 13:49.875
People have gone up there looking for them.
And uh-

13:49.875 --> 13:51.583
Where are you taking us?

13:51.583 --> 13:54.000
Satan worshippers.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
I was up there once, on a hill top.
Oh... There we go.

13:57.875 --> 14:00.875
I actually found that up there.
What the heck is this doing up there?

14:01.666 --> 14:04.666
I added this later, I mean it's kind of a trophy.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.041
This just doesn't occur, I mean somebody-
Maybe we can find one of those up there. Who knows?

14:11.291 --> 14:12.875
Itll go right in your bar.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.875
Hopefully you got plans to protect yourself.

14:15.875 --> 14:16.708
With something.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.708
We got a little .22.

14:19.166 --> 14:22.416
Exactly. A little .22. What skunk ape is gonna

14:23.250 --> 14:28.041
is gonna laugh at a .22. I got some stuff that is a little
more exotic you might be interested in.

14:29.125 --> 14:32.125
Yeah, but we're just going on a hike though.
We should be fine.

14:34.083 --> 14:37.083
Where are you taking us?
What are you talking about? This is gonna be great!

14:38.208 --> 14:42.000
I don't know. He's talking about apes and skulls and stuff.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.540
And you believe that?

14:45.625 --> 14:48.625
It might be knid of cool.
Exactly! i knew you'd come around.

14:49.915 --> 14:52.333
We appreciate it. We thank you so much.

14:52.333 --> 14:53.083
Alrigh. Don't say I didn't warn you.

14:53.083 --> 14:53.875
Hey, I found it!

14:55.625 --> 14:57.458
I knew these things were real.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.541
Get one of me.

15:03.916 --> 15:05.875
New profile pic. Let me see it.

15:08.416 --> 15:10.333
It's awesome.

15:10.333 --> 15:14.750
Sir. Hey, are we gonna find any of these, like live ones out
there, out in the woods?

15:15.791 --> 15:17.125
I wouldn't worry about that.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.125
I'd worry about those guys up there.

15:20.125 --> 15:22.916
They get twice that size too.

15:22.916 --> 15:26.750
It mean, it's a chupacabra for goodness sake.
Is it real?

15:26.750 --> 15:29.750
Those are gonna be out there?
These are real. That's a mountain lion. Yeah.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.415
Thewhole southwest is full of those.

15:32.415 --> 15:35.415
Yeah right.
And that's half as big as they get.

15:35.415 --> 15:38.415
So that's what I'd worry about.

15:38.790 --> 15:40.665
Uh, Thanks!

15:41.583 --> 15:42.583
Are you guys ready to go?
Yeah.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.165
Let's get out of here.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.915
Did he really just say skunk ape?

15:50.500 --> 15:54.333
Yeah, skunk apre. You know, bigfoot of the south.

15:55.375 --> 15:58.290
Right, but.. Out here?

15:58.290 --> 16:01.291
He also talked about a goat man, devil worshippers.

16:01.791 --> 16:03.916
Don't worry. None of tat is real.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.291
They are trusting us.

16:07.291 --> 16:10.666
Is it safe?
Yes, it's safe. What are you worried about?

16:12.041 --> 16:13.500
Come on.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Now this is what I'm talking about young folks.

16:26.291 --> 16:30.000
We'll get some yeehaws out of that skunk ape, and they will
sit up and take notice.

16:31.041 --> 16:32.915
A real flamethrower.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.875
Okay. You can go ahead and get some skunk ape.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.625
Get your hands off me you damn dirty ape!

16:50.583 --> 16:51.915
Yeah, get some!

16:52.165 --> 16:54.125
Take some of that!

16:57.958 --> 16:59.125
We gota get two man.
Yes!

17:01.125 --> 17:02.625
Mother-aper.

17:03.208 --> 17:04.290
Yippee ki yay!

17:04.958 --> 17:06.915
Take that skunk ape.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.625
That's what you need right there young folks!

17:24.290 --> 17:25.540
That's how we do it!

17:30.166 --> 17:33.166
(heavy metal music)

17:44.791 --> 17:47.791
(burning fire)

17:50.375 --> 17:53.375
(eery music)

18:01.791 --> 18:03.375
This is it?

18:03.375 --> 18:06.375
Yeah, no one for miles.

18:06.375 --> 18:09.166
No cell service either.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.708
Yeah babe, that's the point.

18:11.708 --> 18:14.708
You know. You just get away from it all fr a couple of days.

18:15.291 --> 18:18.291
As long as I'm back for my Facebook live Thursday night.

18:19.791 --> 18:21.291
You'll be back.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.541
So, what do you think?

18:30.541 --> 18:33.541
It's gorgeous.

18:33.958 --> 18:36.958
We have to bring the kids back.

18:38.666 --> 18:41.291
Alright you guys. We have two options.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.583
Take jackrabbit trail. It's about three miles more or less.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.250
Or we can take all the gear with us.

18:48.250 --> 18:51.250
Head up to big cat trail and camp out there for the night.

18:54.416 --> 18:55.458
How far is big cat?

18:56.833 --> 18:58.000
Seven miles.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.708
S... Seven miles?

19:00.708 --> 19:03.333
Seven miles?
One way.

19:04.083 --> 19:07.083
Uh, can I vote for rabbit?
Me too.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.291
No. Guys come one, we're here.

19:10.291 --> 19:12.333
Let's do it. Big cat trail.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.583
I agree, big cat trail. It's up to you.

19:14.583 --> 19:17.583
What do you say? Big cat or jackrabbit?

19:19.541 --> 19:20.500
Jackrabbit.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.500
The rabbit wins boys.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.333
Yeah, sure.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.250
Wait, wait. What if it was a tie?

19:29.250 --> 19:31.583
Then the driver's vote counts as two.

19:31.916 --> 19:32.916
Wow.

19:33.291 --> 19:34.250
Those are the rules.

19:34.250 --> 19:37.250
Wrong. The driver's wife's vote counts as two.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.375
I didn't learn that in civics class.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.333
You didn't learn anything in civics.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.333
True.

19:45.041 --> 19:48.041
(upbeat blues music)

20:38.875 --> 20:41.041
Alright. That's good enough.

20:41.041 --> 20:43.958
Take only what you need,
and don't forget your water.

20:43.958 --> 20:46.875
And leave everything else in the tent.

20:46.875 --> 20:49.875
Come on! Let's get this party started. Let's go!

20:53.208 --> 20:56.208
Oh wait, wait! My phone.

20:59.041 --> 21:03.125
Only what you need Becky.
You just said there's no reception out here.

21:04.666 --> 21:06.375
photos.

21:15.416 --> 21:17.125
Wait! Can i have my phone?

21:23.625 --> 21:26.625
Come on you guys.
Let's go!

21:44.166 --> 21:47.166
You don't even pause, you don't even pause!

21:55.125 --> 21:57.375
Look. Even her phone looks like a camera.

22:03.333 --> 22:05.291
Control your man Ashley.

22:44.291 --> 22:45.708
I need to get a stick.

22:46.250 --> 22:48.083
Oh, oh!
That's a good one.

22:48.833 --> 22:49.625
This is pretty cool.

22:51.416 --> 22:52.208
Ouch!

22:52.666 --> 22:55.416
I must really love you.
I guess so.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.750
He's really skinny though.

23:08.916 --> 23:12.208
(cow mooing)

23:29.916 --> 23:31.375
He's gotta ruin everything.

23:32.375 --> 23:33.750
I don't know how you-
You ruined my life!

23:34.125 --> 23:35.416
Oh geez!

23:36.541 --> 23:39.541
(eery music)

24:45.666 --> 24:47.375
Hey! What are you doing?

24:51.541 --> 24:53.000
Can we help you?

24:55.208 --> 24:58.208
I didn't mean to scare anyone, I just saw the campsite.

24:59.708 --> 25:01.875
Making sure everyone was okay.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.083
Jack.

25:03.083 --> 25:05.041
Tex.

25:05.041 --> 25:07.958
Yeah, we're all fine.

25:07.958 --> 25:11.625
Probably be a good idea for you
to head back to your campsite.

25:12.541 --> 25:14.416
You know. Before it gets too dark.

25:15.166 --> 25:17.500
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

25:17.958 --> 25:19.666
You guys have a good rest of the night.

25:19.666 --> 25:21.166
Alright, you too.

25:23.666 --> 25:26.666
(eery music)

25:53.291 --> 25:56.250
Did you guys think that guys was super creepy?

25:56.250 --> 25:57.958
100 percent.

25:58.708 --> 26:00.708
He was definitely up to something.

26:00.708 --> 26:03.708
I swear he was this close to stealing all of our stuff from
the tent.

26:05.041 --> 26:07.416
Yeah. We need to take to take everything with us tomorrow.

26:07.416 --> 26:09.333
And what we don't, we need to put in the truck.

26:09.333 --> 26:12.333
I'm sure he was just a good samaritan on a stroll.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.250
By himself?

26:16.250 --> 26:18.291
Sarcasm font Becky.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.250
Whatever.

26:33.666 --> 26:37.916
All joking aside. A friend of mine
is a game warden in California.

26:37.916 --> 26:40.916
California? Oh, near Los Angeles?

26:41.583 --> 26:44.333
Yeah. Right in downtown LA. Bam!

26:44.333 --> 26:45.791
You should see the wildlife there.

26:45.791 --> 26:47.666
Ah, no. Up in Tahoe.

26:47.666 --> 26:48.666
Charles?

26:48.666 --> 26:54.166
Yeah. He told me that he is actually responsble for 300
square miles of wilderness.

26:54.166 --> 26:56.750
Just himself and his K-9.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.333
Wow. Did he ever run into Bigfoot?

26:58.333 --> 27:00.625
I'd love, like, his autograph.

27:01.583 --> 27:04.250
A game warden's autograph?

27:04.250 --> 27:05.625
No! Bigfoot's autograph.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.625
You know how much money I'd make off that?

27:11.791 --> 27:14.375
Anyway, he told me that

27:15.541 --> 27:18.541
the National Parks were full of people running from the law.

27:19.958 --> 27:22.958
Escaped convicts, felons, bail jumpers.

27:24.583 --> 27:25.708
Seriously?

27:26.291 --> 27:29.291
Yeah. He has a bunch of stories about
encounters that he's had.

27:31.291 --> 27:35.250
I don't know. They run out into the woods thinking that no
one will ever find them.

27:36.708 --> 27:40.541
Game warden surprises them. They have nothing to lose.

27:42.041 --> 27:45.041
And they are usually armed.
It's a dangerous situation.

27:47.041 --> 27:50.041
Wow man. Thanks for the bedtime story.

27:52.541 --> 27:54.541
It's better to be aware.

27:55.208 --> 27:58.208
So that guy today could have been a murderer?

28:02.166 --> 28:05.166
Could have. Could have been a hiker.

28:05.916 --> 28:08.333
That reminds me of a campfire story.

28:08.333 --> 28:11.333
These three boys were at wilderness camp
and they were sneaking out-

28:13.708 --> 28:15.000
(cougar growling)

28:19.708 --> 28:22.708
Between the girl cabin and the girl cabin.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.333
was-

28:25.541 --> 28:28.541
Jumping chollas.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.375
Those damn chollas.

28:41.666 --> 28:44.666
On that note. We're gonna to go to bed.

28:45.041 --> 28:47.166
But we were just in to-

28:47.833 --> 28:48.625
Oh!

28:49.958 --> 28:50.958
Goodnight guys.

28:52.416 --> 28:53.291
Giddy up!

28:58.333 --> 29:00.333
Well, would you look at the time.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.208
Where's my watch?

29:05.583 --> 29:07.125
Maybe you left it at he?

29:08.541 --> 29:11.958
No, no. Tha's my father's watch. I brought it for good luck.

29:12.583 --> 29:14.916
Maybe it's in the truck.

29:14.916 --> 29:17.000
No. No, I remember that-

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Maybe it's in the truck.

29:22.625 --> 29:26.791
Maybe it's in the truck.
Yeah!

29:27.916 --> 29:29.291
Yeah, okay.

29:30.750 --> 29:33.750
Hey. If you guys need-
Goodnight Chad.

29:34.416 --> 29:35.833
Yeah, yeah, but if-

29:36.333 --> 29:38.041
Goodnight you two.

29:39.708 --> 29:41.583
Yeah, goodnight.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.500
Something about being in nature.

29:54.208 --> 29:55.833
Are you cold?

29:56.791 --> 29:58.458
A little.

30:10.416 --> 30:11.541
Thanks.

30:14.958 --> 30:17.958
You better get some sleep. It's going to be a long day
tomorrow.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.375
(thunder crashing)

30:20.375 --> 30:21.833
What's bothering you?

30:24.375 --> 30:26.583
Something was off about that guy Tex.

30:27.625 --> 30:28.916
(Ashley yelling)

30:34.500 --> 30:35.875
Yeah, I thought so too.

30:45.166 --> 30:47.708
If you're still cold, I can tell Chad and Becky-

30:47.708 --> 30:49.250
No. No.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.500
They're finally relaxing like they used to.

30:55.208 --> 30:58.208
Besides. I want to be out here next to you.

31:11.208 --> 31:14.208
(birds chirping)

31:19.208 --> 31:21.458
(screaming)

31:24.166 --> 31:26.750
Get it off! Get it of!
Stand still!

31:26.750 --> 31:28.041
I can't find it!

31:28.041 --> 31:29.500
Get it off me!
Stand still!

31:29.500 --> 31:30.708
I got it.
Are you sure?

31:30.708 --> 31:32.750
I got it. I got it.
Are you sure?

31:32.750 --> 31:33.833
Yeah, I got it.

31:33.833 --> 31:36.833
Jack, that's a little much for a spider. Isn't it?

31:38.791 --> 31:39.916
You're good.

31:41.875 --> 31:43.416
Good morning everyone.

31:43.416 --> 31:44.250
Whose hungry?

31:47.291 --> 31:48.958
Hey, that's my...

31:49.541 --> 31:52.541
Relax man. There's plenty of this stuff for everybody. Okay.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.833
You can share. Be a nice boy David.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.833
Jack. Teriyaki or original?

32:03.833 --> 32:05.458
Original.
There you go.

32:06.166 --> 32:08.583
David?
Teriyaki.

32:09.916 --> 32:11.291
Ladies?

32:11.291 --> 32:12.666
I have my own food.

32:12.666 --> 32:14.500
Dana?
Original.

32:14.500 --> 32:18.875
Original. Breakfast is served.

32:20.166 --> 32:22.458
This is definitely not original.

32:23.875 --> 32:26.166
Alrigh. Let's do this!

32:27.708 --> 32:28.750
Don't I look cute?

32:28.750 --> 32:31.750
Wow. You look beautiful babe.

32:31.833 --> 32:33.291
Thanks babe.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.750
Is everyone else ready to go?

32:48.125 --> 32:49.000
Yeah, okay guys.

32:50.541 --> 32:53.166
Take your wallet and your phones.

32:53.583 --> 32:56.250
And anything else you don't want stolen.

32:56.250 --> 32:57.583
And put everything else in the truck this time guys.

33:00.166 --> 33:03.166
See, that's what I was talking about.

33:05.958 --> 33:08.958
Don't worry. She's got nothing on you.

33:14.375 --> 33:15.625
Bring all your jerkey.

33:15.625 --> 33:16.583
All of it?

33:16.583 --> 33:18.250
Unless you want to carry the extra water?

33:18.791 --> 33:19.958
I'll be the jerkey.

33:53.166 --> 33:56.166
(wind blowing)

34:34.541 --> 34:37.541
(music playing)

34:54.041 --> 34:54.791
Come on.

35:10.750 --> 35:12.083
(Ashley laughing)

35:25.583 --> 35:27.041
Can we take a break?

35:27.041 --> 35:28.708
Is your makeup running?

35:28.708 --> 35:30.416
Shut p.

35:30.416 --> 35:33.750
We have been walking. We have to be at least somewhere
close.

35:34.875 --> 35:37.875
We've been walking forever.
No. An hour and fifteen minutes.

35:38.500 --> 35:39.916
Are you kidding me? That's it?

35:39.916 --> 35:40.958
Yeah.

35:41.541 --> 35:43.375
How much farther do we have?

35:43.375 --> 35:44.416
About five and a half miles.

35:44.416 --> 35:46.500
Five and a half miles?
You can do it.

35:46.500 --> 35:50.208
Are you kidding me? I'm staying right here. I'll wait for
you guys to come back

35:50.916 --> 35:52.708
I think that's a good idea.

35:52.708 --> 35:54.250
Come on.

35:54.250 --> 35:56.625
Nope! We are all in this together.

35:57.125 --> 35:59.125
Forward ho!

36:01.250 --> 36:03.250
Who gave him coffee?

36:03.250 --> 36:04.416
I want some.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.625
(cougar growling)

36:35.125 --> 36:36.291
Would you look at that...

36:37.833 --> 36:38.958
Gorgeous.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.208
We're witnessing history.

36:52.791 --> 36:56.541
It's beautiful babe,
but I think other people have seen this before.

36:57.208 --> 37:00.208
No, I'm not talking about nature, Becky.

37:00.333 --> 37:02.625
We got all the way here and she hasn't taken a selfie yet.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.500
Poor Becky.

37:12.416 --> 37:15.250
Ah, but we should take a picture.
It's so pretty.

37:15.250 --> 37:18.250
I hate pictures.
I don't care. Here Becky, take a picture of us.

37:18.416 --> 37:19.083
Alright.

37:22.833 --> 37:24.458
Open your eyes David.

37:26.291 --> 37:28.666
What's that?
Where?

37:29.583 --> 37:30.916
Down there.

37:32.625 --> 37:33.875
It's gold.

37:39.166 --> 37:40.166
We're rich!

37:44.625 --> 37:45.916
Hey! That's-

37:47.375 --> 37:48.875
That's my Dad's watch.

37:50.708 --> 37:52.166
But how did it get?

37:54.625 --> 37:56.500
It ws that guy at the campsite yesterday.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.416
See, I told you guys he was a criminal.

37:58.416 --> 38:01.125
There wasn't even anything missing from the tent.

38:01.125 --> 38:04.125
Well maybe it fell off my wrist when
we were putting the tent together.

38:04.291 --> 38:06.458
Then when he was going through our stuff, he picked it up.

38:07.541 --> 38:11.041
But hey. I told you guys.
It's my good luck charm.

38:13.750 --> 38:14.625
(soft growling)

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
What is it?

38:19.291 --> 38:20.333
Shh.

38:21.666 --> 38:22.708
Did you hear that?

38:22.958 --> 38:23.791
No.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.750
I think we should get out of here.

38:28.750 --> 38:31.750
I don't have no argument with that. Let's go.
Yeah.

38:31.875 --> 38:33.166
Come on.
Let's go.

38:33.541 --> 38:36.166
(soft growling)

38:38.250 --> 38:39.375
Come on Jack.

38:47.041 --> 38:51.875
(growling)

38:58.625 --> 39:02.250
I gotta take a piss.
Oh yeah, me too.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.166
Yeah, I have to go too.

39:06.666 --> 39:08.291
ou guys can go over there.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.791
Another stop.

39:20.291 --> 39:21.333
Jack!

39:22.750 --> 39:24.041
Shit, Jack!

39:27.083 --> 39:27.916
Jack.

39:39.541 --> 39:41.333
Jack, what the hell is this?

39:42.625 --> 39:44.833
Should we take them with us?

39:44.833 --> 39:45.875
I'm not touching those man.

39:46.250 --> 39:50.208
No, no. That's just a prank.
That happens all the time.

39:51.541 --> 39:52.583
A prank?

39:52.958 --> 39:57.208
It's best to be safe, and let the sheriff know where it is.

39:58.166 --> 40:01.166
If that's a prank, that's sick.
And by sick, I mean kind of awesome.

40:06.625 --> 40:10.458
And you guys give us a hard time aobut
going to the bathroom together.

40:11.166 --> 40:13.833
Anyway. You're not going to
believe what we found back there-

40:13.833 --> 40:15.958
Hey! We gotta hurry up.
We're losing light.

40:19.375 --> 40:19.833
Let's go.

40:25.333 --> 40:26.166
What happened?

40:27.541 --> 40:29.333
I don't know what's going on.

40:29.333 --> 40:32.333
We need to get back to the truck and get out of here.

40:34.416 --> 40:36.333
But I don't want them to freak out.

40:37.125 --> 40:38.125
Okay.

40:39.125 --> 40:40.291
Let's move it people!

40:41.166 --> 40:42.750
What's the rush now?

40:42.750 --> 40:43.750
Aren't you hungry?

40:45.958 --> 40:47.875
Yeah. I guess so.

40:49.125 --> 40:49.916
Okay.

40:58.916 --> 41:00.333
Victory!

41:04.125 --> 41:06.125
Wait. Jack.

41:07.041 --> 41:08.208
The truck is gone.

41:09.125 --> 41:10.250
What?

41:13.166 --> 41:14.958
The truck. It's been stolen!

41:19.541 --> 41:21.541
I can't believe this. We are in the middle of nowhere.

41:21.541 --> 41:24.541
i mean I can see this happening in Downtown Phoenix,
but out here?

41:25.166 --> 41:26.708
I mean, really?

41:28.500 --> 41:33.041
It was that guy Tex! He waited for us to
leave, and then he stole the truck!

41:34.625 --> 41:36.875
You forgot to take my watch!

41:38.250 --> 41:39.875
How are we gonna get out of here?

41:41.750 --> 41:46.458
And he has my purse! I can’t call
to cancel my credit cards.

41:47.625 --> 41:49.416
You didn't take it with you?

41:50.041 --> 41:51.791
I didn’t want to carry it.

41:53.458 --> 41:56.458
Alright guys. We have to remain calm.

41:56.916 --> 41:58.333
We're stuck out here!

41:59.958 --> 42:03.833
Maybe for a little while, but we’re next to the road.
The ranger will come by tonight.

42:03.833 --> 42:05.458
And We’ll flag him down.

42:06.458 --> 42:10.250
We were going to stay an extra night anyway.
We’ll just all share the tent.

42:11.708 --> 42:13.541
We're going to all fit in the tent.

42:14.791 --> 42:17.791
Dana and I, we'll sit in the chairs and stand guard.

42:18.750 --> 42:23.416
i'm sorry. Stand guard? Is there something
you’re not telling us?

42:30.291 --> 42:34.666
Alright. Someone stole the truck, there is nothing
we can do about that now.

42:36.208 --> 42:39.208
But one thing is for sure, we can’t go running
into the wilderness at night.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
So we’re going to sit here and wait for the ranger.

42:43.458 --> 42:46.000
Jack. What about the bloody clothes back there?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.916
Bloody clothes?

42:47.916 --> 42:51.750
Yeah, some psychopath chopped some
people up and stole our truck.

42:53.875 --> 42:56.375
We peed next to dead bodies?

42:56.375 --> 42:58.666
No. No. They're aren't any dead bodies.

42:58.791 --> 43:00.041
How do you know?

43:00.041 --> 43:01.416
Do you see any?

43:01.708 --> 43:02.666
No.

43:02.666 --> 43:05.666
And you were right next to the clothes.

43:08.833 --> 43:11.041
As long as we stick together, we're going to be fine.

43:13.791 --> 43:15.958
What if the park ranger doesn't come?

43:18.250 --> 43:21.250
Then we will wait until morning, hike out to the main road.

43:21.500 --> 43:24.500
We passed several cars and RVs on the way in.
Someone will pick us up.

43:25.416 --> 43:29.541
What about dinner? Did he steal that too?

43:32.583 --> 43:34.208
I’m afraid so.

43:36.583 --> 43:38.458
Your hero saves the day.

43:39.208 --> 43:41.000
Gus's Beef Jerkey!

43:41.833 --> 43:43.666
Teriyaki, Original Jack.

43:44.625 --> 43:46.458
Always prepared baby.

43:50.541 --> 43:52.291
(distant thunder)

43:52.291 --> 43:55.291
(cougar growling)

44:05.750 --> 44:07.791
(coyote howling)

44:08.875 --> 44:11.000
Hey John, talk to me over here for a minute.

44:11.750 --> 44:14.750
John? Who's John?

44:16.833 --> 44:19.083
Is that like an ex or something?

44:20.708 --> 44:22.041
That's my name.

44:22.041 --> 44:25.041
That's not your name. It's Jack.
Is it John, or is it Jack?

44:26.041 --> 44:29.041
It's John, but Jack is short for John.

44:29.041 --> 44:29.541
What?

44:30.750 --> 44:32.375
You've heard of JFK right?

44:32.875 --> 44:35.416
President John F. Kennedy. I’m not stupid.

44:36.708 --> 44:39.708
Jackie, Robert, his whole family referred to him as Jack.

44:41.583 --> 44:42.208
What?

44:46.666 --> 44:50.916
That’s totally made up. I’m so done with this day.

44:51.791 --> 44:52.958
Are you ready for bed?

44:53.916 --> 44:56.750
I'm beyond tired.
I'm tired too.

44:56.750 --> 44:57.916
Goodnight.

45:02.208 --> 45:05.208
Yeah, I think it's time to hit the sack.

45:05.458 --> 45:06.541
I'm exhausted.

45:07.875 --> 45:12.625
I just want this day to be over. Wake me up if the ranger
comes,

45:13.625 --> 45:16.625
Otherwise, I’ll see you in the morning. Goodnight.

45:20.791 --> 45:22.041
Goodnight.

45:36.041 --> 45:36.333
John.

45:37.125 --> 45:37.541
yeah?

45:42.458 --> 45:44.166
Do you think somebody killed those people?

45:46.916 --> 45:47.791
I don't know.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.125
What it is you keep hearing?

46:02.208 --> 46:05.958
Sounds like a low growl. Very
quiet.

46:07.625 --> 46:08.208
Animal?

46:09.291 --> 46:12.916
That’d be my guess. Mountain lion
maybe?

46:15.583 --> 46:18.583
But a mountain lion wouldn’t stalk a group of humans.
They'd ...

46:19.333 --> 46:22.000
do everything they could to avoid us.

46:22.000 --> 46:22.750
Exactly.

46:27.875 --> 46:30.875
The only thing I can think of, is maybe the animal is rabid?

46:31.791 --> 46:33.791
I mean, that's happened before.

46:34.916 --> 46:36.291
A rabid cougar?

46:39.666 --> 46:40.708
That's a horror movie.

46:41.166 --> 46:41.833
Yeah.

46:47.708 --> 46:49.708
And we're out here in the open.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.750
It hasn’t attacked us yet, right?

47:11.750 --> 47:13.750
Maybe it's a coyote waiting to go through our trash.

47:19.708 --> 47:21.083
You think we're safe?

47:23.708 --> 47:24.625
Yeah.

47:28.250 --> 47:30.208
I'm not falling asleep.

47:33.708 --> 47:35.583
And you're not either.

47:40.958 --> 47:42.958
(animal in bushes)

47:45.750 --> 47:46.333
Insect?

47:50.541 --> 47:52.333
You scared the hell out of me.

47:54.458 --> 47:56.333
Sorry. A little jumpy.

48:00.166 --> 48:03.166
(coyote howling)

48:05.791 --> 48:07.166
(foreboding music)

48:07.541 --> 48:08.958
(screaming

48:21.916 --> 48:24.291
David! Where's David?

48:24.916 --> 48:26.208
David!

48:29.208 --> 48:30.916
Jack!

48:38.250 --> 48:39.416
(cougar growling)

48:41.125 --> 48:42.291
(cougar growling)

48:42.416 --> 48:43.458
Jack!

48:45.208 --> 48:46.375
(cougar growling)

48:48.791 --> 48:49.958
(cougar growling)

48:52.166 --> 48:53.000
Jack!

48:56.458 --> 48:57.333
Do you see it?

48:57.333 --> 48:58.166
No!

48:59.208 --> 49:00.166
Let's go. Come on!

49:00.166 --> 49:01.333
(cougar growling)

49:03.250 --> 49:06.250
(intense music)

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
(folk music)

49:41.791 --> 49:43.541
Is anybody here?

49:44.166 --> 49:47.166
I'm just stopping by to check on your folks.

49:49.541 --> 49:53.333
Nice little campsite.
Chairs are facing a fire though.

49:53.500 --> 49:55.208
Not looking at the sunrise.

49:58.333 --> 50:01.333
I guess I'll be back later.
I'll be back later to check on you guys!

50:13.541 --> 50:16.541
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

50:17.291 --> 50:18.625
We should be looking for David.

50:19.583 --> 50:20.291
He's dead.

50:20.750 --> 50:21.833
Chad!

50:22.166 --> 50:24.333
What? He's dead isn't he?

50:25.041 --> 50:26.708
We don't know if he's dead.

50:28.250 --> 50:29.791
Did you not see all the blood?

50:31.541 --> 50:34.000
Look! Look at you!

50:34.208 --> 50:37.208
He's dead!
That's enough! Leave her alone.

50:44.791 --> 50:47.791
Come on man. Don't lose you head.

50:48.583 --> 50:52.375
I woke up this morning, covered in my friends blood.

50:53.291 --> 50:56.291
There's something out there that's hunting us.
How am I supposed to act?

50:56.333 --> 50:59.333
Well that girl right there is covered in her husband's
blood.

51:00.458 --> 51:02.583
And we don't even know where the body is.

51:03.833 --> 51:06.083
You think she'd even want to see the body?

51:06.458 --> 51:09.458
It's probably chewed up, and torn up by
a goddamned wild animal.

51:13.666 --> 51:14.500
you're right.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.125
I'm sorry man.

51:19.541 --> 51:22.541
Keep it together! We need you.

51:30.625 --> 51:32.333
Hey Ashley.

51:36.416 --> 51:37.750
I'm sorry.

51:39.791 --> 51:40.875
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

51:44.791 --> 51:46.958
Sorry guys.
We'll keep looking.

52:02.291 --> 52:05.291
(wind blowing)

52:17.958 --> 52:20.958
Now we have to go very quietly and very quickly.

52:23.375 --> 52:24.458
Alright?

52:25.791 --> 52:28.791
Yeah? No? Yeah? You ready?

52:28.833 --> 52:29.875
If you say so.

52:29.875 --> 52:30.916
Alright. Let's go.

52:48.666 --> 52:50.791
(cougar growling)

52:50.791 --> 52:52.375
David's shirt!
Ashley, no!

52:52.375 --> 52:53.041
Dana!

53:00.458 --> 53:01.916
(cougar growling)

53:03.041 --> 53:04.416
Jack, shoot it!

53:04.958 --> 53:05.750
(cougar growling)

53:05.750 --> 53:07.250
I don't see it! I don't see it!

53:08.416 --> 53:09.583
Shoot it!

53:10.208 --> 53:13.208
There's two! Jack, there's two!

53:14.541 --> 53:17.125
Shoot it! Shoot them!
Whre is it, I don't see it!

53:17.125 --> 53:18.041
What are you doing? Shoot it!

53:18.916 --> 53:20.375
(cougar growling)

53:21.041 --> 53:21.916
Becky!

53:25.041 --> 53:26.458
Becky!

53:28.041 --> 53:28.750
(cougar growling)
Dana, Dana!

53:29.916 --> 53:32.916
Come on!

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
Hello! The park ranger.

53:42.333 --> 53:45.333
Looks the same as this morning.

53:45.333 --> 53:46.583
Nothing's changed.

53:47.500 --> 53:49.208
It feels different.

53:50.333 --> 53:53.333
Someone in here?

54:17.625 --> 54:18.583
Blood.

54:20.750 --> 54:22.208
No trail?

54:27.875 --> 54:29.041
Human.

54:37.041 --> 54:39.291
Mary this is Gil. Come in.

54:42.750 --> 54:44.791
Mary this is Gil. Do you copy?

54:46.875 --> 54:47.875
Loud and clear.

54:49.500 --> 54:53.666
We have ourselves here a possible animal attack at big cat.

54:55.208 --> 54:56.208
Copy that.

54:59.416 --> 55:03.333
Notify the sheriff;s department. I'm gonna head up the
trail.

55:05.458 --> 55:06.750
Roger.

55:06.750 --> 55:08.083
Over and out.

55:17.041 --> 55:20.041
Go, go, go.
Is it behind us?

55:22.583 --> 55:25.583
Nah, nah. I don't think it's following us.

55:27.250 --> 55:29.083
What are we going to do?

55:30.875 --> 55:33.875
I don't know. But we just have to keep going. Okay?

55:36.791 --> 55:38.375
We have to go find him.

55:39.583 --> 55:43.916
I don't want to leave right here. I think we're safe here
and I don't want to go back out there with them.

55:44.958 --> 55:46.500
Becky and Chad need us.

55:48.750 --> 55:51.750
But who is going to protect us if we get attacked?

55:54.041 --> 55:56.208
They would do the same for you Ash.

55:57.666 --> 56:00.000
Look, that's a chance you're gonna have to take. Alright?

56:00.000 --> 56:01.708
I don't think I can do it.

56:02.208 --> 56:07.125
Hey, look. You can. do this for Connor.

56:09.041 --> 56:12.041
You're all he has left. You can do it.

56:13.125 --> 56:14.458
I'll help you.

56:17.208 --> 56:18.458
Come on.

56:24.083 --> 56:25.916
That’s enough

56:27.541 --> 56:28.708
What are you doing?

56:28.708 --> 56:33.208
This trail ends! What happens when we get to the top?

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
I don't know. We’ll figure out something out. Okay?

56:37.458 --> 56:40.458
We were all supposed to stay together!

56:40.875 --> 56:42.916
You’re the one who ran off first!

56:42.916 --> 56:48.625
I’m not going any further. All those survival shows tell you
to stay put when you’re lost.

56:49.333 --> 56:54.500
We’re not lost! A man-eating animal somewhere out there and
it's chasing us right now!

56:54.500 --> 56:57.500
I don’t care! I’m not moving.

56:58.666 --> 57:01.666
So this is your plan then? You're just going to stay here
until that thing comes and kills us?

57:02.208 --> 57:07.583
No. I’m going stay here and wait for the others. They can’t
be that far behind us.

57:07.583 --> 57:10.041
But we don't even know if they're behind us.

57:10.041 --> 57:13.041
They could havegone in the other direction. Or for all we
know, they could be dead!

57:14.916 --> 57:16.083
No.

57:17.541 --> 57:20.541
Stop.
No, no... They’re not-

57:21.000 --> 57:22.666
I'm sorry.

57:22.666 --> 57:24.333
I'm sorry.

57:25.166 --> 57:29.708
What I mean is. They haven't been behind us the entire time.

57:31.583 --> 57:34.000
Maybe they went off and got sme help.

57:35.708 --> 57:40.708
We have to keep going. That'll buy us more time for Jack,
or the park ranger to come find us.

57:40.708 --> 57:41.666
Okay?

57:42.666 --> 57:43.625
Okay?

57:47.500 --> 57:48.458
Okay.

57:49.500 --> 57:50.500
Come on.

57:54.875 --> 57:55.750
Gil, do you copy?

57:59.000 --> 58:00.666
Yeah Mary. Go ahead.

58:00.666 --> 58:02.416
What’s your 20?

58:02.416 --> 58:05.083
I’m about a two miles in.

58:05.083 --> 58:09.833
You’re on own for a little while. Sheriff’s responding to an
abandoned van. Possible homicide.

58:12.083 --> 58:15.083
Roger that.
Copy that.

58:16.083 --> 58:18.125
I’ll update accordingly.

58:19.250 --> 58:22.250
Over and out.

58:31.666 --> 58:33.625
We need to find David.

58:33.625 --> 58:36.625
Hey, we will. Right Jack?

58:37.083 --> 58:38.416
Yeah.

58:41.458 --> 58:43.041
(cougar growling)

58:59.916 --> 59:02.125
We're almost there.

59:07.958 --> 59:10.958
Isn't this where we stopped?
What?

59:11.208 --> 59:12.125
To pee?

59:13.833 --> 59:15.958
I don't know. It all looks the same to me.

59:17.125 --> 59:19.375
No. This is it.

59:20.208 --> 59:23.208
I want to see them.
See what?

59:24.208 --> 59:25.833
The bloody clothes.

59:27.208 --> 59:31.750
Why? Why do you want to see them-
Maybe the left a knife or something

59:31.750 --> 59:34.750
behind to protect ourselves with.

59:35.125 --> 59:38.125
It didn't do them any good. Becky!

59:45.500 --> 59:48.500
See, I told you. Nothing.

59:48.750 --> 59:51.750
Now seriously. We have to keep going.

59:53.041 --> 59:56.041
Meu Deus.
(My God)

59:57.916 --> 1:00:00.916
I don't want to die like this.

1:00:06.500 --> 1:00:08.166
You're not going to die.

1:00:08.166 --> 1:00:11.166
Okay.

1:00:11.166 --> 1:00:14.166
Seriously, we have to keep going.

1:00:14.416 --> 1:00:15.708
I promise.

1:00:17.750 --> 1:00:19.375
Becky.

1:00:20.333 --> 1:00:23.333
Hey, hey. Come on!

1:00:25.416 --> 1:00:26.625
Come on.

1:00:38.416 --> 1:00:39.791
(cougar growling)

1:00:42.541 --> 1:00:43.916
(cougar growling)

1:00:46.500 --> 1:00:47.875
(cougar growling)

1:00:57.083 --> 1:00:58.375
(becky screaming)

1:01:07.166 --> 1:01:08.458
(becky screaming)

1:01:09.958 --> 1:01:11.333
(cougar growling)

1:01:21.166 --> 1:01:22.333
Stop.

1:01:23.750 --> 1:01:24.875
Let's go! What are-

1:01:27.416 --> 1:01:29.041
I hear footsteps.

1:01:32.833 --> 1:01:39.750
Hey! I’m ranger, Gil, Gil Rodgers. Are you guys okay

1:01:40.375 --> 1:01:42.541
Yeah, yeah. We're alright.

1:01:42.541 --> 1:01:45.833
Is that your camp down there?
Yeah.

1:01:45.833 --> 1:01:50.666
It’s in terrible shape.
None of you are hurt?

1:01:51.208 --> 1:01:54.208
No. We're alright. But three of our friends are missing.

1:01:57.750 --> 1:02:00.333
We're being hunted by a couple mountain lions.

1:02:00.333 --> 1:02:05.166
You’re mistaken about mountain lions.
They don’t hunt large groups of humans.

1:02:06.166 --> 1:02:09.166
Well then what would have dne this?

1:02:09.375 --> 1:02:10.791
What's that?

1:02:11.041 --> 1:02:14.000
This is my husband David's shirt.

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.500
He needs medical attention. Where is he?

1:02:19.666 --> 1:02:21.208
We haven't found him.

1:02:25.083 --> 1:02:28.083
Mary, come in

1:02:28.166 --> 1:02:30.166
Go ahead.

1:02:30.166 --> 1:02:37.166
It looks like large predator has in
fact, been attacking our hikers.

1:02:40.958 --> 1:02:45.083
Get that sheriff to send some deputies down here.
And send the medical.

1:02:46.250 --> 1:02:48.625
Roger that.

1:02:50.541 --> 1:02:53.541
And warn the Apache County rangers as well.
I think-

1:02:53.541 --> 1:02:54.916
(cougar growling)

1:02:56.250 --> 1:02:57.583
Gil.

1:02:57.583 --> 1:02:58.958
(cougar growling)
Gil. Do you Copy?

1:03:00.208 --> 1:03:01.583
(cougar growling)

1:03:07.125 --> 1:03:09.833
You get a shot. Take it!

1:03:09.833 --> 1:03:11.458
I'm planning on it.

1:03:13.041 --> 1:03:14.125
(gun firing)

1:03:16.625 --> 1:03:20.458
That's not a good idea. I think we should
go back to the camp,

1:03:20.708 --> 1:03:23.708
Get all your stuff, and head ot of here.

1:03:24.041 --> 1:03:26.250
The sheriff will be coming soon.

1:03:35.500 --> 1:03:41.000
Gil! Come in! If you can here this, get in your
vehicle. The sheriff is warning of extreme danger.

1:03:41.958 --> 1:03:44.958
He’s headed your way.
Gil!

1:03:47.500 --> 1:03:50.291
Be careful, there were two.

1:03:50.291 --> 1:03:52.916
When we get to that campsite,
get what you need.

1:03:52.916 --> 1:03:55.916
Drive back into town, and leave the rest to me.

1:03:56.541 --> 1:03:58.166
Our truck was stolen.

1:03:58.166 --> 1:03:59.250
Did you report it?

1:03:59.250 --> 1:04:00.916
We haven't had a chance to yet.

1:04:00.916 --> 1:04:03.916
I hear that they found an abandoned truck out on the
highway.

1:04:04.500 --> 1:04:07.500
I'll drive you past it. See if it's yours.

1:04:20.625 --> 1:04:21.333
Gil!

1:04:21.333 --> 1:04:22.708
(cougar growling)

1:04:24.708 --> 1:04:26.083
(cougar growling)

1:04:32.208 --> 1:04:34.041
You see that?

1:04:34.041 --> 1:04:35.291
What?

1:04:35.291 --> 1:04:38.291
The glare.
No.

1:04:39.833 --> 1:04:42.833
It looks metallic. Maybe glass.

1:04:44.083 --> 1:04:46.875
On top. It's got-

1:04:46.875 --> 1:04:50.916
What is this? Somekind of homemade contraption?

1:04:51.750 --> 1:04:55.291
Speakers? And on top.

1:04:57.583 --> 1:05:00.041
Some kind of motion detector.

1:05:00.041 --> 1:05:01.000
What is-

1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:02.375
(cougar growling)

1:05:05.791 --> 1:05:07.166
(cougar growling)

1:05:07.666 --> 1:05:09.250
What the hell is going on?

1:05:09.583 --> 1:05:11.958
That's the end of that.

1:05:11.958 --> 1:05:14.208
Is this a forrest-
Is this one of yours?

1:05:14.208 --> 1:05:15.625
No ma'am.

1:05:15.625 --> 1:05:17.041
(Ashley screaming)

1:05:17.041 --> 1:05:18.250
Ashley!
Ashley!

1:05:32.333 --> 1:05:34.375
What are you doing in our home?

1:05:35.125 --> 1:05:38.125
This land, it belongs to the state.

1:05:38.583 --> 1:05:41.250
No, it belongs to us!

1:05:41.250 --> 1:05:42.416
Who's us?

1:05:42.416 --> 1:05:45.416
The rightful owners.

1:05:45.916 --> 1:05:48.916
We can talk about this. You let her go.

1:05:49.083 --> 1:05:51.083
No more talking.

1:05:57.958 --> 1:05:59.416
(Gil screaming)

1:06:24.666 --> 1:06:26.041
(cougar growling)

1:06:29.291 --> 1:06:30.666
(cougar growling)

1:06:40.625 --> 1:06:42.000
(gun firing)

1:06:44.041 --> 1:06:45.416
(gun firing)

1:06:47.416 --> 1:06:48.666
Go!

1:06:52.666 --> 1:06:54.208
I'm not leaving you!
(gun firing)

1:06:55.625 --> 1:06:58.625
Dana, get out of here!
(gun firing)

1:07:01.750 --> 1:07:03.000
Go!
No!

1:07:03.625 --> 1:07:05.000
(gun firing)

1:07:08.875 --> 1:07:09.541
John!

1:07:12.541 --> 1:07:13.916
(gun firing)

1:07:27.125 --> 1:07:28.500
(gun firing)

1:08:15.250 --> 1:08:18.250
(western blues music playing)

1:08:55.875 --> 1:09:01.958
Another gorgeous Arizona day in the books. Days like today
remind those snowbirds why they have a

1:09:01.958 --> 1:09:07.125
why they have a second mortgage. Forecast for
tomorrow is a high of 78, with a low of 52.

1:09:07.125 --> 1:09:13.625
We have breaking news from the sheriff’s office: The suspect
has been identified in the brutal murders

1:09:13.625 --> 1:09:17.750
of those four hikers and park
ranger in the Superstition Wilderness

1:09:17.750 --> 1:09:25.250
Eric Kairis was born and raised in Salem, Oregon. He was
convicted of murder in 2017. He was the founding

1:09:25.250 --> 1:09:31.416
member of the radical group ’Give It Back’, or GIB. The
group is responsible for over 20 deaths

1:09:31.416 --> 1:09:39.416
in the past 2 years. Kairis was most recently a resident of
the largest psychiatric hospital in the state

1:09:39.416 --> 1:09:46.083
of Oregon, until his escape 3 weeks ago. The incident is
still under investigation.

1:09:46.083 --> 1:09:48.250
The four hikers were on vacation-

1:09:56.500 --> 1:10:02.833
My name is Eric Kairis. Yes, I am the founder of ’Give it
Back’. Don’t say GIB, I hate that!

1:10:02.833 --> 1:10:09.416
It minimizes our credibility. For all of my followers and
believers, this video is... Canon.

1:10:09.833 --> 1:10:13.583
They may have burned our physical network to the ground, but
they have only strengthened

1:10:13.583 --> 1:10:16.083
our resolve and our cause.

1:10:16.083 --> 1:10:21.125
I’m locked in this cage, like our brothers and sisters
around the world. But they will not contain me,

1:10:21.250 --> 1:10:29.208
or our message. Humans have had control of our lands for far
too long. Blood is the only message they will understand.

1:10:29.416 --> 1:10:32.416
They will not give it back, we must take it!

1:10:36.250 --> 1:10:39.250
(western blues music playing)

1:10:40.916 --> 1:10:43.916
Oh, they made it!

1:10:45.541 --> 1:10:47.583
So nice to see you again.

1:10:48.791 --> 1:10:51.791
Welcome children. Come into the light.

1:10:52.750 --> 1:10:54.875
All are welcome.

1:11:10.250 --> 1:11:12.416
And I want to thank you folks.

1:11:13.291 --> 1:11:15.708
Can't say I didn't warn you.

1:11:16.375 --> 1:11:17.416
Enjoy.

1:11:23.458 --> 1:11:26.458
(inspiring rock music)
