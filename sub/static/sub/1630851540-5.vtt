TUANI
REGION OF CORSICA

01:07.000 --> 01:09.291
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:24.041 --> 01:27.250
-Don't kill me. It's around here.
-Fuck. Come on! Dig!

01:49.208 --> 01:50.750
It's the money! Fuck!

01:51.500 --> 01:53.625
Yes! It's all here!

02:26.666 --> 02:27.583
All right.

02:28.083 --> 02:29.875
Your friend finally found the money.

02:36.541 --> 02:39.375
Thank you, Ali. Fuck!

02:43.166 --> 02:45.125
I told you we could count on him.

02:45.916 --> 02:50.250
Give me 24 hours to charter a helicopter
and I'll get you out of here.

02:52.916 --> 02:54.875
Thank you, Doctor.
You're saving our lives.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.458
Don't get too excited, Olivier,

02:58.041 --> 02:59.208
because you have cancer.

02:59.291 --> 03:00.208
What?

03:02.125 --> 03:03.166
That's a joke.

03:04.958 --> 03:06.333
That's a good one.

03:06.416 --> 03:08.916
You shouldn't laugh too hard.
You have leukemia.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.500
You're starting to get my sense of humor.

03:15.041 --> 03:16.250
Son of a bitch.

03:17.791 --> 03:18.750
So?

03:20.875 --> 03:23.708
What's that racket?
Why are these deadbeats still alive?

03:23.791 --> 03:24.916
Mr. Cavillan,

03:25.666 --> 03:27.083
this is perfect timing.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.833
Our patients all contracted an infection.

03:29.916 --> 03:32.958
We need to put them on antibiotics
for a week before harvesting their organs.

03:33.041 --> 03:34.916
An infection? What a shady excuse.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.583
No, that's not an excuse.

03:36.666 --> 03:37.875
-They're really sick.
-Really.

03:37.958 --> 03:40.250
What? Did Pénélope put this in your head?

03:40.333 --> 03:42.583
Léonard, calm down.
He's right. We're really sick.

03:42.666 --> 03:44.833
-We're very sick.
-It's true.

03:44.916 --> 03:46.666
-We're not at all well.
-Yeah, Léonard.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.666
You have to admit the conditions here
are less than sanitary.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.500
That's true, damn it.
There's dust everywhere.

03:52.583 --> 03:54.208
This place isn't five stars.

03:54.291 --> 03:55.625
Hold on!

03:55.708 --> 03:58.000
Tell me the truth
or I'll pop a cap in the beanpole!

03:58.083 --> 03:59.875
Léonard, you're out of your mind!

04:10.166 --> 04:11.833
Fuck, I can't believe this.

04:14.750 --> 04:15.666
Come on.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.666
We're burying five-million-euro corpses.

04:24.583 --> 04:26.166
Damn, we lost everything.

04:27.875 --> 04:30.250
The good news is we're not burying Aure.

04:31.333 --> 04:32.833
Yeah, obviously.

04:32.916 --> 04:34.458
Thank you, God.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.083
-Grab him.
-Yeah.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.708
Fuck. Go on.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.166
Come on.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.416
Fucking pain in the ass.

04:47.583 --> 04:49.708
Do you realize last year we were

04:50.750 --> 04:53.208
trying to sell an app to investors?

04:55.666 --> 04:56.833
Look at us now.

04:57.833 --> 05:00.041
I think doing this type of stuff
is my destiny.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.916
I'm a thug. Like father, like son.

05:05.416 --> 05:06.416
Come on.

05:08.625 --> 05:09.625
Let's go.

05:12.916 --> 05:13.916
Olive.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.166
What?

05:17.916 --> 05:19.375
I have to tell you something.

05:19.958 --> 05:20.958
What is it?

05:27.625 --> 05:28.750
Tell me.

05:30.750 --> 05:31.791
You and I…

05:37.041 --> 05:38.250
You and I are…

05:40.083 --> 05:41.083
Bro!

05:42.666 --> 05:43.583
There you go.

05:44.291 --> 05:45.291
What do you mean?

05:47.833 --> 05:48.791
Bros.

05:48.875 --> 05:50.083
What do you mean, bros?

05:52.625 --> 05:54.000
You and I are brothers, bro.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.416
Yeah, we're bros.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.750
No, I mean, we're really brothers, bro.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.166
Are you losing it? What are you saying?

06:00.250 --> 06:01.916
Of course you're my bro.
We're bros. I know.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.125
No, what I'm trying to say is your father…

06:05.250 --> 06:07.166
Your father is my father.

06:08.375 --> 06:12.166
He cheated on my mother with your mother.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.166
What are you saying? That's nonsense.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.333
Olive, believe me. I'm serious.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.708
-We're blood brothers.
-Who told you that?

06:19.791 --> 06:22.125
My father. Well, your father. Our father.

06:22.208 --> 06:23.375
-Gérard?
-Gérard.

06:23.458 --> 06:26.125
-Gérard talks nonsense.
-No. Olive.

06:29.125 --> 06:31.583
He told me
when we were on the truth serum.

06:32.416 --> 06:33.291
What?

06:37.458 --> 06:38.458
We're brothers.

06:42.916 --> 06:44.208
We're brothers.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.125
Come here, brother.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.125
Come here.

07:06.041 --> 07:07.208
It's crazy, isn't it?

07:07.958 --> 07:09.791
We were bros before being bros.

07:10.625 --> 07:11.708
That's beautiful.

07:16.416 --> 07:17.333
Hold on.

07:19.833 --> 07:21.458
Does that mean Aure's my sister?

07:22.083 --> 07:23.708
Yeah, she's your sister.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.166
Of course she's your sister.

07:25.750 --> 07:26.833
Fuck.

07:27.333 --> 07:28.500
What's wrong?

07:29.500 --> 07:31.625
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.333
What did you do?
I had to kill the surgeon because of you.

07:40.416 --> 07:41.833
What are you talking about?

07:41.916 --> 07:43.250
I wasn't born yesterday.

07:43.333 --> 07:46.458
You think I don't see you
going behind my back to save those clowns?

07:46.541 --> 07:49.500
Hold on. Calm down.
I haven't moved. You're imagining things.

07:49.583 --> 07:50.833
I'm not a moron.

07:50.916 --> 07:53.166
You're making such a mess for me!
You don't even realize!

07:53.250 --> 07:54.416
What do I tell the Russians?

07:54.500 --> 07:57.041
I sold them organs
and I have no one to harvest them!

07:57.708 --> 07:59.916
So the Hazans are alive?

08:00.666 --> 08:02.375
Is that what you're worried about?

08:02.458 --> 08:04.458
-You love them that much? Come.
-What are you doing?

08:04.541 --> 08:06.333
-Stop it!
-I'll give you the same treatment.

08:06.416 --> 08:07.833
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

08:07.916 --> 08:10.583
Stop!

08:12.833 --> 08:15.000
They must've gotten the wrong monastery.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.958
No, there's no mistake.

08:17.041 --> 08:18.750
Your info was off.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.708
What must the Colombians think of us now?

08:21.291 --> 08:24.000
-We'll find the right address.
-No.

08:24.083 --> 08:27.833
That's nice of you,
but the Hazans have cost us enough money.

08:28.458 --> 08:32.625
So the shitty tips
from the strings you pulled as a lawyer,

08:32.708 --> 08:34.208
keep them to yourself.

08:34.791 --> 08:36.208
We're calling off the search.

08:36.291 --> 08:37.625
Is that clear?

08:37.708 --> 08:40.041
Watch your tone.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.666
You don't need to lecture us.
You suck too.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.458
Excuse me? What are you talking about?

08:45.541 --> 08:48.416
About the little Grégory case. You sucked.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.333
Obviously it was Bernard Laroche
who threw him in the Vologne!

08:51.416 --> 08:52.500
You moron!

08:53.083 --> 08:54.333
And Dupont de Ligonnès?

08:54.416 --> 08:55.875
That was a real mess!

08:55.958 --> 08:57.666
I don't know where he is!

08:57.750 --> 09:02.708
Move your asses instead of arresting
random people in airports!

09:03.208 --> 09:04.625
And Natascha Kampusch?

09:04.708 --> 09:06.791
Did you even think
about Natascha Kampusch?

09:06.875 --> 09:09.875
How many kids did she have with her father
before you showed up?

09:10.500 --> 09:11.625
You sucked!

09:12.416 --> 09:13.666
Sucked balls!

09:14.166 --> 09:16.291
She's joking.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.500
Complete shit!

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
All right.

09:21.708 --> 09:24.208
-It still hurts.
-That's normal.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.875
-Breathe.
-This our dorm.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.083
Right next door are the showers

09:30.791 --> 09:32.083
and the toilets.

09:32.166 --> 09:34.833
When you go through here,
there's a hallway,

09:34.916 --> 09:37.625
but I don't know
if there are one or two doors.

09:37.708 --> 09:39.791
Do you think
there are one or two doors? Olive?

09:41.958 --> 09:43.625
Damn it, bro. Olive!

09:43.708 --> 09:45.458
Focus. Are there one or two doors?

09:45.541 --> 09:48.125
Yeah, there are one or two doors.
That's for sure.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.041
Are you fucking with me?

09:53.833 --> 09:54.666
Catherine?

09:55.541 --> 09:56.375
Fuck.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.458
My love. I thought you were dead.

10:12.166 --> 10:15.583
It's all right.
I was so scared about you too. So scared.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.166
What happened? Where were you?

10:19.500 --> 10:21.958
They asked me to translate

10:22.458 --> 10:24.083
for a deal with Russians.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.791
They wanted to buy our organs.
It was awful.

10:27.875 --> 10:28.916
Fuck.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.541
Don't worry. It's over now.

10:30.625 --> 10:31.958
We're getting out of here now.

10:32.041 --> 10:34.875
-We're working on a map of the monastery.
-Yeah.

10:34.958 --> 10:38.083
We absolutely have to make it.
Otherwise, Léonard will kill us.

10:40.041 --> 10:41.166
Is that your map?

10:41.750 --> 10:42.958
Yeah.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.458
Yeah, this is the map.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.875
-Here.
-Thanks.

10:56.666 --> 10:58.083
You know, I did the same as you.

10:59.791 --> 11:00.833
What?

11:01.416 --> 11:02.500
With Olivio.

11:03.375 --> 11:06.500
I got an Olivier double
and pretended I had moved on.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.083
Like you with William.

11:11.083 --> 11:12.208
I'm here.

11:13.083 --> 11:14.791
Yeah. How are you?

11:15.333 --> 11:17.208
Don't listen to her, love.

11:17.291 --> 11:19.500
That's nonsense.
They don't even look alike.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.458
"That's nonsense.
They don't even look alike."

11:21.541 --> 11:23.458
I used to say that too. Yeah.

11:24.750 --> 11:28.250
You're still in love with Joseph.
If not, you wouldn't do all this for him.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.500
Saved by the bell.

11:34.583 --> 11:35.958
You got lucky.

11:38.125 --> 11:38.958
Hello?

11:39.041 --> 11:41.750
Dr. Prévot, this is Mr. Finanouk.

11:41.833 --> 11:43.208
Hello, Mr. Finanouk.

11:44.041 --> 11:45.458
Yes, I'm listening.

11:46.833 --> 11:49.416
Did you put me on speaker?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.291
Yes. No.

11:51.375 --> 11:54.541
I mean, yes, because I'm in the middle

11:54.625 --> 11:55.875
of shaving my pussy!

11:58.708 --> 12:00.333
Don't cut yourself.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.083
Listen. Unfortunately,
I have some very bad news.

12:04.166 --> 12:06.666
It's not gonna work out for your loan.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.250
I'm really sorry.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.750
However, for your hookah cat bar,

12:11.833 --> 12:13.583
I have another proposition for you,

12:13.666 --> 12:17.875
but it's more in line
with your surgical skills.

12:19.166 --> 12:21.125
I'm interested. Tell me more.

12:21.208 --> 12:25.791
All right. I need to harvest organs
from three men and two women.

12:26.541 --> 12:27.666
Damn, even Ludmilla?

12:29.083 --> 12:32.333
The surgeon I planned to use
had an accident

12:32.833 --> 12:34.833
and my client is pressed for time.

12:34.916 --> 12:37.750
I need to know
if you're available right away.

12:38.416 --> 12:39.541
That depends. How much?

12:41.208 --> 12:43.333
We're supposed to be professionals.
We're professionals.

12:43.416 --> 12:44.791
All right.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.875
I'm offering 120,000 euros
and that's non-negotiable.

12:47.958 --> 12:49.333
Yes.

12:49.416 --> 12:51.416
Well, it is non-negotiable actually.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.541
That's a no, sir.

12:54.625 --> 12:56.458
-What are you doing?
-Are you kidding?

12:56.541 --> 12:58.458
Hold on. I have principles.

12:58.541 --> 13:01.208
-At that price, out of the question.
-Call him back! He's our only in.

13:01.291 --> 13:02.875
I don't want to get ripped off.

13:02.958 --> 13:05.125
Clémentine, I swear I will hit you.
Call him back.

13:05.208 --> 13:07.416
Calm down. He'll call back.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.125
-And if he doesn't?
-Why wouldn't he?

13:10.208 --> 13:12.625
He'll call back. He has my number.

13:15.708 --> 13:18.291
No, we're not going this way.
That's not a good idea at all.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.875
We'll be seen.

13:19.958 --> 13:22.416
If we go this way, however,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.541
we can take a passageway
that goes right to the parking lot.

13:26.625 --> 13:30.875
All the guards' cars are there,
one of which is an old red 4x4.

13:31.375 --> 13:34.916
We have to take that red 4x4
because the left rear door doesn't lock.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.250
Why are you looking at me like that?
Do I have a booger?

13:38.875 --> 13:40.291
No, nothing. I'm listening.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.708
All right, did you hear me?

13:41.791 --> 13:45.333
We have to take the red 4x4
because the left rear door is always open.

13:45.416 --> 13:46.958
Great. We got it.

13:47.041 --> 13:49.416
Sorry, but how do you know all that?

13:50.666 --> 13:53.375
I saw it when I was translating
for the Russians.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.833
-That doesn't mean anything, Joseph.
-It does.

14:04.333 --> 14:07.583
It means I seriously doubt
you speak Russian.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.250
What did she say?

14:18.583 --> 14:20.791
I don't know.
But apparently she speaks Russian.

14:21.458 --> 14:24.291
I said,
"Then we need to go to Bastia Airport."

14:24.375 --> 14:25.416
What? Bastia?

14:26.500 --> 14:28.583
-We're in Corsica?
-Yes.

14:28.666 --> 14:30.625
-Really?
-No way.

14:31.125 --> 14:32.458
Everyone here speaks Spanish.

14:32.541 --> 14:35.708
-Even the cops speak Spanish.
-That's true.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.333
Maybe, but trust me. They took me
to a village in Corsica to translate.

14:39.416 --> 14:41.958
Yeah? Was it nice? Did you have a feast?

14:42.041 --> 14:43.708
Was there Orezza and brocciu?

14:43.791 --> 14:46.041
Yes, there was brocciu.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.666
Damn, lucky.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.083
Anyway, we need to leave by 7:00 a.m.

14:50.166 --> 14:51.500
No.

14:51.583 --> 14:54.791
I disagree. It's too dangerous.
The longer we stay, the less safe it is.

14:54.875 --> 14:57.666
We're gonna wait
until everyone's asleep and leave.

14:57.750 --> 15:00.583
No, between 7:00 and 7:30,
they switch shifts.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.541
We'll be less likely to run into someone.

15:02.625 --> 15:04.958
Damn, that's crazy.
How does she know all this?

15:05.041 --> 15:06.208
Did you see that too?

15:06.291 --> 15:09.375
Are you going to contradict her
every time she says something?

15:10.208 --> 15:11.750
You don't have any info anyway.

15:11.833 --> 15:14.541
All right? You're all talk.
So now let's listen.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.833
She has a little too much info.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.833
We're listening, my love.

15:19.583 --> 15:21.541
And how do we get out of the dorm?

15:22.125 --> 15:22.958
Catherine?

15:23.041 --> 15:24.625
To get out of the dorm,

15:25.916 --> 15:27.416
we're gonna use this.

15:28.375 --> 15:30.083
A cardboard box. Great.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.791
Those are matches, Jo.

15:31.875 --> 15:34.333
-Those are matches?
-Are you stupid or what?

15:35.583 --> 15:36.666
Those are matches.

15:38.208 --> 15:39.458
And there you go.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.833
-Answer, for fuck's sake!
-You have to let him stew.

15:44.916 --> 15:48.583
Plus, I love this ringtone.
I just added it three days ago. I love it.

15:49.791 --> 15:51.083
-Come on!
-Answer it!

15:52.125 --> 15:53.333
-Hello?
-Hello?

15:53.416 --> 15:54.625
Mr. Finanouk.

15:54.708 --> 15:56.291
-We got cut off.
-Yes.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.166
I'm sorry. I have another call.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.958
Hello?

16:00.875 --> 16:03.375
-No, you're not interrupting.
-Damn it, Clémentine!

16:04.750 --> 16:06.500
What's wrong with you? Are you insane?

16:11.625 --> 16:13.833
So, from what I can recall,

16:15.083 --> 16:17.166
I have the 30 GB weekend plan
with unlimited texts

16:17.250 --> 16:19.958
and it's not quite enough
'cause I watch a ton of videos.

16:20.958 --> 16:23.875
-Get him back on, for fuck's sake!
-I'm negotiating.

16:24.541 --> 16:26.958
You're not the one
over your limit every month.

16:27.458 --> 16:28.625
So selfish.

16:29.375 --> 16:30.541
Ma'am, I will call you back.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.291
I can't hear myself think here.
Have a good day.

16:33.916 --> 16:35.166
Oh my.

16:36.250 --> 16:37.958
Mr. Finanouk, I'm listening.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.125
Great. You can count on us.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.041
Okay. All right. That works.

16:54.125 --> 16:56.166
Take care.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.291
Take care. All right, bye.

16:58.791 --> 17:00.875
Bye.

17:01.916 --> 17:03.166
He hung up.

17:05.875 --> 17:09.333
Youssef, put three pairs of underwear
in a plastic bag.

17:09.416 --> 17:12.125
-The plane takes off in an hour.
-Where are we going?

17:13.958 --> 17:14.875
Corsica.

17:15.458 --> 17:17.125
-Corsica?
-Yes.

17:18.208 --> 17:19.708
L'île de beauté.

17:35.875 --> 17:37.291
I wanted to say

17:37.375 --> 17:39.000
sorry about Joseph.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.333
I don't know what he has against you.

17:42.708 --> 17:43.541
I don't know.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.875
Sometimes kids are complicated, you know.

17:49.833 --> 17:50.666
Yeah.

17:51.458 --> 17:52.291
I mean,

17:53.041 --> 17:56.000
I don't have any, but I imagine
sometimes it's not easy.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.000
No.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.916
I knew you were brilliant,
but I was blown away.

18:06.833 --> 18:08.500
That's nothing. It's just chemistry.

18:08.583 --> 18:11.125
Some saltpeter, sulfur, a spark, and boom.

18:11.916 --> 18:12.750
Boom.

18:14.708 --> 18:15.541
Boom.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.208
Go on. Grind.

18:20.458 --> 18:22.541
Aure, bring the bag closer.

18:22.625 --> 18:25.083
-It's okay.
-Make sure it doesn't fall outside.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.500
I'm getting it.
Keep scraping instead of bitching.

18:27.583 --> 18:28.416
Fuck.

18:29.541 --> 18:32.750
Honestly,
don't you think her tattoo's weird?

18:33.625 --> 18:36.208
Unbelievable.
You won't shut up about that. Shit!

18:36.291 --> 18:39.833
Dollar tattoos are a mistake you make
when you're young. It means nothing.

18:39.916 --> 18:43.083
I told you she used to be a stripper.
She wanted dollars in her panties.

18:43.166 --> 18:45.791
Stripper, my ass! All right?

18:45.875 --> 18:49.666
She happens to have the same tattoo
as that other sick psycho.

18:49.750 --> 18:50.916
She speaks Russian.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.291
She happens to know the monastery
like the back of her hand.

18:53.375 --> 18:55.416
Now she's an explosives expert.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.708
Oh yeah, and she happened to disappear

18:57.791 --> 18:59.708
the day we were
getting butchered by the doctor,

18:59.791 --> 19:01.750
and then she happened to come back.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.458
That's a lot of coincidences.

19:03.541 --> 19:06.208
Listen, Jo. I trust her. She's dependable.

19:06.291 --> 19:08.916
And remember she risked her life
to get your ass out of jail.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.875
It seems like you kind of forgot.

19:10.958 --> 19:12.958
-She's just a stranger.
-No, not at all.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.291
She's Dad's girlfriend.
So now she's family.

19:15.375 --> 19:17.791
No, she's not. I don't give a shit.
I don't trust her.

19:18.708 --> 19:19.833
You're such a pain. Fuck.

19:19.916 --> 19:21.375
I think Catherine's okay.

19:21.458 --> 19:22.958
She's beautiful, smart…

19:23.041 --> 19:25.375
Stop it. We get it.
You just want to fuck her.

19:25.458 --> 19:28.666
Yes, I do, but that's not the issue.
I trust her. That's all.

19:28.750 --> 19:29.958
That's amazing.

19:30.041 --> 19:33.791
For once, Olivier agrees with me.
I think you must really be wrong.

19:33.875 --> 19:36.375
-Why do you say that?
-True. Why do you say that?

19:36.458 --> 19:38.083
Why? Because look at yourselves.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.875
Always stuck to each other like barnacles
and you agree on everything.

19:40.958 --> 19:43.125
Stop it. This doesn't count.
I'm scraping saltpeter.

19:43.208 --> 19:44.875
We've disagreed many times.

19:44.958 --> 19:46.541
Yeah, he's right.

19:46.625 --> 19:48.833
You two are close. That's fine.
Not a problem.

19:49.375 --> 19:52.458
It's just that sometimes
I feel like I don't exist. You know?

19:54.416 --> 19:55.333
Really?

19:55.916 --> 19:56.833
Yes.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.125
I'm sorry you feel that way.

20:02.208 --> 20:05.791
That wasn't intentional. Honest.
It's just that you're so confident.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.666
To us, you've got your shit together.

20:07.750 --> 20:10.208
True.
I feel like you don't really need us.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.208
Yeah, well,

20:12.708 --> 20:13.875
you're wrong.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.541
There.

20:20.291 --> 20:22.750
By the way,
I need to tell you something about Olive.

20:23.375 --> 20:24.416
What?

20:24.500 --> 20:26.000
No, settle down, Jo.

20:26.083 --> 20:28.833
Whoa. Hold on. Don't get carried away.

20:28.916 --> 20:31.000
There. See?
You're hiding things from me again.

20:31.083 --> 20:33.166
-That's not true.
-I don't give a shit. I'll tell you.

20:33.250 --> 20:34.541
My shoulders hurt.

20:34.625 --> 20:35.875
Shut up.

20:35.958 --> 20:38.333
Scrape that fucking thing.
I don't give a shit.

20:38.416 --> 20:40.250
-Jo.
-Come on, damn it.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.291
We're here.

20:46.833 --> 20:49.000
It's true,
it does look a lot like Colombia.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.375
All right, listen
instead of talking about Colombia.

20:52.958 --> 20:56.291
Once we go through that gate, that's it.
There's no going back.

20:56.875 --> 20:59.041
-Get that in your head.
-I got it. Obviously.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.833
You scared? Wanna call the police?

21:00.916 --> 21:03.083
-What? The police?
-Well, me neither.

21:03.166 --> 21:04.583
I don't want them to end up in jail.

21:05.541 --> 21:08.625
-I'm raring to go. Are you ready?
-Obviously.

21:08.708 --> 21:09.958
I booked the boat.

21:10.041 --> 21:12.166
We're gonna handle this like pros.
Put this on.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.708
-What are you doing?
-It's important.

21:13.791 --> 21:16.041
It makes you look less ghetto.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.958
Stop it. I look like a samurai.

21:18.458 --> 21:19.958
Damn, I look like a samurai.

21:20.958 --> 21:23.125
A fucking samurai, you know?

21:23.208 --> 21:24.541
-Yeah.
-My head…

21:24.625 --> 21:25.833
Let's go.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.833
Enough.

21:48.291 --> 21:49.208
Hello.

21:49.791 --> 21:50.708
Hello.

21:51.625 --> 21:53.250
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.500
Dr. Prévot and Dr. Ben Aflahak?

21:55.583 --> 21:58.375
-Ben Affleck.
-Aflahak, righteousness.

21:59.291 --> 22:00.333
You have toucans.

22:02.666 --> 22:05.291
It's mating season.
I'm gonna make them get a hard-on.

22:08.083 --> 22:09.166
Shut the fuck up!

22:10.125 --> 22:13.333
It's from the speakers.
Can't you tell it's fake?

22:13.416 --> 22:15.166
It's all staged.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.875
Like the cacti. I imported them.

22:17.958 --> 22:21.291
We're trying to make the prisoners believe
they're in South America.

22:21.375 --> 22:24.125
-To confuse them.
-Obviously.

22:24.875 --> 22:25.916
-It's good.
-It's crap.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.208
It's not working at all. I could tell
the birds were fake right away.

22:29.291 --> 22:33.041
I'll perch you on a branch
and you can do your insane bird calls.

22:33.125 --> 22:35.208
No, it's well done. Really.

22:35.291 --> 22:36.750
Give me your phones.

22:39.375 --> 22:41.000
A matter of discretion.

22:41.625 --> 22:43.166
I'll give them back later.

22:48.416 --> 22:49.791
I wanted to switch phones anyway.

22:49.875 --> 22:51.791
-Oh yeah?
-It wasn't working anymore.

22:51.875 --> 22:53.208
You'll have to.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.291
So are we getting started right away?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.833
No, take it easy.

22:57.916 --> 23:00.416
My clients need the organs tomorrow.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.875
We'll harvest them at the last minute.
That's easier.

23:02.958 --> 23:04.125
That's best.

23:04.625 --> 23:05.708
Come on. Let's go.

23:08.833 --> 23:13.750
Could we examine them
in order to assess the situation?

23:13.833 --> 23:17.250
No, I'll introduce you tomorrow morning.
You should rest now.

23:17.333 --> 23:19.875
I'll show you your rooms.
Tomorrow's a big day.

23:19.958 --> 23:22.125
I'd rather you be relaxed.

23:22.208 --> 23:24.541
Yeah. And I need to shit.

23:25.125 --> 23:26.416
Yeah, the trip…

23:36.500 --> 23:37.625
What are you doing?

23:40.083 --> 23:42.083
This way, we'll have some privacy.

23:48.875 --> 23:49.916
What's wrong?

23:58.375 --> 23:59.208
Damn.

24:03.083 --> 24:03.958
My love…

24:06.750 --> 24:07.958
will you marry me?

24:10.791 --> 24:11.666
Are you serious?

24:11.750 --> 24:12.791
I love you.

24:14.166 --> 24:15.125
And

24:16.333 --> 24:20.166
I don't know how much time I have left.
So, yes, I'm serious.

24:20.666 --> 24:22.208
Will you marry me?

24:25.208 --> 24:26.375
All right.

24:27.416 --> 24:28.500
What?

24:28.583 --> 24:29.500
Yes.

24:30.416 --> 24:31.666
Yes, yes?

24:31.750 --> 24:32.875
Yes, yes.

24:54.750 --> 24:55.625
You're awake?

24:57.333 --> 25:00.000
No, I'm a little anxious
about the escape tomorrow.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.000
Aren't you?

25:01.666 --> 25:02.708
Yeah, a little.

25:10.916 --> 25:11.875
What are they doing?

25:11.958 --> 25:14.208
Nothing special. They're sleeping.

25:14.875 --> 25:15.750
Okay.

25:16.750 --> 25:17.916
Good night, bro.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.333
Yeah, good night, bro.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.708
-Hey, Olive?
-Yeah?

25:24.833 --> 25:26.333
I was thinking about something.

25:27.208 --> 25:29.583
-We're really brothers now.
-Yeah?

25:30.916 --> 25:33.416
Maybe we don't need
to call each other "bro."

25:33.500 --> 25:34.583
You're right, bro.

25:36.625 --> 25:37.708
Forget it.

25:38.208 --> 25:39.375
Good night, bro.

25:39.458 --> 25:40.791
Yeah, good night, bro.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.833
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

25:44.916 --> 25:47.625
-What do you mean, "nothing"?
-No, don't look, Jo!

25:47.708 --> 25:48.958
Bro, what's this?

25:49.458 --> 25:52.083
You said they were sleeping,
but his dick is out. What the hell?

25:52.166 --> 25:54.250
-He took his member out.
-What the fuck?

25:54.333 --> 25:56.458
Looks like I'm not
the only new family member.

25:56.541 --> 25:59.291
Enough with your shitty jokes.
That's your father! A little respect.

25:59.375 --> 26:01.416
I don't care.
He's been my father for five minutes.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.291
You can't do that! Stop staring.

26:03.375 --> 26:04.250
Are you insane?

26:04.333 --> 26:07.250
I'm looking. I don't care.
He's doing her doggy style.

26:08.041 --> 26:09.250
Fuck.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.500
They're struggling, like dogs.

26:12.583 --> 26:13.750
Yeah, the dick's not entering.

26:13.833 --> 26:16.208
They're totally out of sync.
There's no chemistry.

26:16.791 --> 26:18.208
It'll never work between them.

26:18.291 --> 26:19.500
Damn, that dick.

26:19.583 --> 26:21.416
It's amazing, like a chocolate éclair.

26:22.250 --> 26:23.958
Yeah, my father has a nice dick.

26:24.041 --> 26:26.958
-Does that dick run in the family?
-Yeah.

26:27.041 --> 26:29.041
-I never saw a dick like that on you.
-I have one.

26:29.125 --> 26:30.875
You don't. I never saw it.

26:30.958 --> 26:33.208
When you see it, it's asleep.

26:33.291 --> 26:35.666
-But when it's been deployed…
-No, fuck.

26:43.375 --> 26:45.208
Did you bring your explosive belt?

26:46.708 --> 26:47.791
Why do you ask?

26:48.375 --> 26:50.500
-Why are you asking?
-No, no reason.

26:50.583 --> 26:52.166
Kind of racist, aren't you?

26:52.250 --> 26:54.125
No, it's because of your beard.

26:54.208 --> 26:56.041
There you go. Like I said, you're racist.

26:56.125 --> 26:59.333
Oh my God, you Jews
always take everything the wrong way.

26:59.916 --> 27:01.750
-What are you talking about?
-There.

27:01.833 --> 27:03.875
Get those ropes.
Let's go to the parking lot.

27:03.958 --> 27:06.208
-What for?
-Trust me.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.750
Okay, pass me the saltpeter and sulfur.

27:37.916 --> 27:39.833
-It's…
-In the desk over there.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.916
-There's nothing here.
-How can that be? It was there.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.208
What the hell?

27:51.291 --> 27:52.750
-Look, Dad.
-Are you joking?

27:52.833 --> 27:55.875
No, unbelievable. You guys lost the mix?

27:55.958 --> 27:59.041
Fucking unbelievable. Fuck.

27:59.125 --> 28:02.875
We can't even follow through with
Catherine's plan now. What a disaster.

28:04.208 --> 28:07.041
It's all right.
Thankfully, I have another box of matches.

28:07.625 --> 28:09.125
That's incredible.

28:10.416 --> 28:12.041
We're saved. She has more matches.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.375
Yeah, that's great.

28:13.458 --> 28:16.291
What a crazy coincidence
that she has a second box of matches

28:16.375 --> 28:19.000
while being held captive.
Well done, Catherine.

28:19.833 --> 28:21.916
Okay, if we all scrape together,
we can do it.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.291
No, the only thing you're gonna scrape
is my asshole! Is that clear?

28:25.375 --> 28:28.750
I just have to say I can't stand her.
I don't trust her.

28:28.833 --> 28:31.833
She's been trying to trick us
from the start. Open your eyes.

28:31.916 --> 28:34.708
She has two boxes of matches!
How? That doesn't happen.

28:34.791 --> 28:37.541
If we follow her,
death will be waiting behind that door.

28:38.625 --> 28:40.541
You're totally insane.

28:40.625 --> 28:43.041
-Don't tell me you threw out the powder.
-Obviously he did.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.708
All right, no more pretending.
I have to tell you something.

28:48.750 --> 28:49.916
I threw out the powder.

28:50.666 --> 28:53.750
Joseph, damn it. I swear,
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you.

28:54.916 --> 28:57.375
If you don't like Catherine,
that's your problem.

28:57.458 --> 29:00.791
But you just sentenced us to death,
you imbecile.

29:05.458 --> 29:07.750
I'll get the Hazans.
Tell the doctors to get ready.

29:07.833 --> 29:08.750
Okay.

29:12.041 --> 29:14.791
When are you gonna stop being so blind?
Can't you see she's shady?

29:14.875 --> 29:16.083
You're the one who's shady.

29:16.166 --> 29:18.958
You're always throwing a wrench in things.
You're shady.

29:19.041 --> 29:20.541
I always throw a wrench in things?

29:20.625 --> 29:22.875
-Stop being manipulated by this bitch.
-No!

29:22.958 --> 29:25.375
-Don't talk about my wife like that.
-Your wife?

29:25.458 --> 29:26.583
Yes, my wife.

29:27.625 --> 29:28.958
We're getting married.

29:29.583 --> 29:31.791
-What?
-You're not getting married at all.

29:31.875 --> 29:33.333
If we follow her, we're dead.

29:33.416 --> 29:34.708
-No! Jo!
-Let go of me!

29:35.375 --> 29:36.500
Let go of me!

29:40.291 --> 29:43.041
-Let go of me!
-Stop it!

29:43.791 --> 29:46.458
Calm down. Listen.

29:47.250 --> 29:49.291
I know this is a complicated situation.

29:49.833 --> 29:51.666
But I swear
I only want what's best for you.

29:54.083 --> 29:56.000
You think I'm shady,
and you have the right to.

29:56.083 --> 29:58.083
But, Joseph, you have to trust me,

29:58.833 --> 30:01.291
'cause I'm the only one
who can get us out of here.

30:02.166 --> 30:03.041
Please.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
-Give it to her.
-Jo.

30:10.333 --> 30:11.208
Give it back.

30:16.416 --> 30:17.416
Damn it.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.208
Here. Go ahead. Follow her.

30:23.375 --> 30:25.458
What are you doing?
Trying to screw me over?

30:25.541 --> 30:28.416
No, Léonard, calm down.
I'm just trying to work things out.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.500
Aren't you trying to help them escape?

30:30.583 --> 30:32.291
Calm down, please. Lower that gun.

30:32.375 --> 30:34.041
You're not actually going to shoot--

30:34.708 --> 30:35.625
Fuck!

30:35.708 --> 30:37.916
-Shit!
-Catherine? Are you okay?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.250
Mom!

30:40.333 --> 30:41.625
Hold on! Move over! Mom!

30:42.208 --> 30:44.958
-Fuck.
-Mom?

30:45.041 --> 30:46.541
José, come here.

30:54.875 --> 30:56.166
He said, "Mom."

30:57.125 --> 30:58.333
I told you.

30:58.416 --> 31:00.375
I didn't realize. He said, "Mom."

31:01.166 --> 31:03.583
-Dad, are you all right?
-I don't feel well.

31:03.666 --> 31:04.875
-Hold on. Sit down.
-Gérard.

31:04.958 --> 31:06.291
Whoa, he's falling.

31:06.375 --> 31:07.500
Hold on!

31:08.000 --> 31:09.083
Dad?

31:09.166 --> 31:10.708
Dad, stay with us. Dad?

31:10.791 --> 31:12.541
Dad? Hey!

31:12.625 --> 31:14.791
Dad? Open your eyes!

31:14.875 --> 31:16.916
-Gérard!
-Dad!

32:19.541 --> 32:21.666
