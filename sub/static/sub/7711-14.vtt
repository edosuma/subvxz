00:00.801 --> 00:01.802
Hello, son.

00:01.835 --> 00:03.237
If you're watching this,

00:03.271 --> 00:05.406
that means
I'm already dead.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.241
Life is a road...

00:07.275 --> 00:09.410
How do you know
it's gonna be a boy?
How--

00:09.443 --> 00:11.045
Would you stop interrupting,
please?

00:11.079 --> 00:13.347
Yesterday,
I was scraping some gunk

00:13.381 --> 00:15.583
off my wall sockets
with a metal fork,

00:15.616 --> 00:18.786
and I gave myself
the nastiest shock.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.821
And when I came to,

00:20.854 --> 00:22.490
I had an epiphery.

00:24.292 --> 00:27.095
Life is precious.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.796
And if I die,

00:28.829 --> 00:32.633
I want my...son...

00:34.868 --> 00:37.138
to know the dealio.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.107
The dealio of life.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.142
Here are some things
that I want to teach you

00:41.175 --> 00:42.443
that your mother
won't be able to.

00:42.476 --> 00:45.313
To jump-start a car,
first pop the hood.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.615
Then you take these bad boys

00:47.648 --> 00:50.784
and clip them
anywhere on the engine.

00:50.818 --> 00:54.155
Then, you take these,

00:54.188 --> 00:56.757
and clip them wherever.

00:58.892 --> 00:59.727
Number eight.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.695
Learn how to take off
a woman's bra.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.531
What?
We will demonstrate
on Pam.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.532
No.
And--

01:04.565 --> 01:05.866
No.
Come on.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.835
You just
twist your hand,

01:07.868 --> 01:09.470
until...

01:09.503 --> 01:11.739
something breaks.

01:11.772 --> 01:12.873
Ow.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.242
Well, you get the picture.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.776
Thanks, Pam.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.812
And remember,
no matter what,

01:18.846 --> 01:20.381
I will always love you.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.449
What if he's a murderer?

01:21.482 --> 01:23.651
He's not gonna be
a murderer.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.753
Maybe that's
how you die.
You know what?

01:25.786 --> 01:28.456
Dwight,
do you want to do this or no?

01:28.489 --> 01:31.125
I want to do this.
Okay.

01:31.159 --> 01:33.127
From the top.
Ready?

01:33.161 --> 01:34.495
3...
Action.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.498
[cheerful music]

01:37.531 --> 01:45.539
*

01:55.216 --> 01:56.684
Hello, everyone.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.552
As you know,

01:58.586 --> 02:00.488
we are six days away

02:00.521 --> 02:01.889
from Phyllis's wedding.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.357
[scattered applause]

02:03.391 --> 02:05.193
So get your suits
to the dry cleaners,

02:05.226 --> 02:06.294
and get your hair did.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.861
And Karen, um...

02:07.895 --> 02:09.663
you might want to invest
in a--a dress

02:09.697 --> 02:11.332
or a skirt
of some kind

02:11.365 --> 02:13.167
if you don't already
have one.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.602
This may be Phyllis's

02:14.635 --> 02:15.936
only wedding ever.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.505
It's my job to ensure

02:17.538 --> 02:18.906
that none of you
look like ragamuffins.

02:18.939 --> 02:22.776
So...I am instituting

02:22.810 --> 02:25.179
primae noctis.

02:25.213 --> 02:27.181
Primae noctis,

02:27.215 --> 02:28.782
I believe
from the movie Braveheart,

02:28.816 --> 02:30.951
and confirmed on Wikipedia,

02:30.984 --> 02:35.523
is when the king
got to deflower every new bride

02:35.556 --> 02:37.258
on her wedding night.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.694
So...

02:40.728 --> 02:42.896
I'm sorry.
I...

02:42.930 --> 02:44.965
had a very different
understanding

02:44.998 --> 02:46.834
as to what primae noctis meant.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.770
I'm trying to get everyone
excited about Phyllis's wedding,

02:49.803 --> 02:51.305
because I want her

02:51.339 --> 02:53.341
to get people excited
about my wedding,

02:53.374 --> 02:54.675
when the time comes.

02:54.708 --> 02:55.809
Which won't be hard.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.378
Because it's gonna be awesome.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.879
A lot better than hers,
that's for sure.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.814
It'll probably be on a boat.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.915
What's up,

03:01.949 --> 03:03.351
spinstas?

03:03.384 --> 03:04.518
Nothing.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.986
You know, this
is a luncheon shower.

03:06.019 --> 03:06.820
Girls only.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.422
No problem.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.490
The guys are having

03:09.523 --> 03:11.559
a little shindig
of their own

03:11.592 --> 03:12.926
in the warehouse.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.662
From 2:30 to 3:15.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.498
It is the only time
that Bob was available.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.866
Sort of a guys' night out.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.768
A G-N-O, if you will.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.002
A g-no.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.805
Actually, it's more
of a guys' afternoon in.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.440
A G-A-I.

03:26.474 --> 03:27.508
A gai.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.610
Not...

03:29.643 --> 03:31.612
Not...it's, uh...
not gay.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.947
It's a, just a...

03:33.981 --> 03:36.384
It's a bridal shower
for guys.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.851
A guy shower.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.254
An hour-long shower
with guys.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.362
[Jim yawns]

03:48.396 --> 03:49.897
(Karen)
I guess Jim and I

03:49.930 --> 03:51.932
have had a little bit
of a rough patch

03:51.965 --> 03:53.667
for the past couple weeks,

03:53.701 --> 03:55.536
but we had
some really good talks.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.870
And actually,

03:56.904 --> 03:59.407
now I think
that we're better than ever.

03:59.440 --> 04:04.878
Karen and I
had a long...talk last night.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.880
And the night before that.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.682
And, uh...

04:08.716 --> 04:09.950
Every night...

04:09.983 --> 04:13.887
for the last five nights.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.936
(Pam)
Something's up
with Jim and Karen.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.505
Not that I've been
eavesdropping.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.607
It's not really
any of my business.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.009
But...
I've gotten pretty good

04:36.043 --> 04:38.612
at reading
the back of Jim's neck.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.581
Halpert!

04:40.614 --> 04:43.317
Tall, queer,
handsome as ever.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.885
[lisping]
"Hey, everybody, it's me.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.421
Jim."

04:47.455 --> 04:49.623
Hello, hello.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.325
Todd Packer.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.493
Karen Filipelli.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.527
Jim's girlfriend.

04:53.561 --> 04:54.695
Shut up!

04:54.728 --> 04:55.863
Yep.
Shut it!

04:55.896 --> 04:57.698
That's rude.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.999
Either this chick
is a dude,

04:59.032 --> 05:01.535
or Halpert
got scared straight!

05:01.569 --> 05:02.770
(Michael)
Yes, yes.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.937
Oh ho!
Yes.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.072
Oh ho ho ho ho.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.907
There--uh!
[groans]

05:06.940 --> 05:07.875
What happened?

05:07.908 --> 05:09.343
[Michael gasping]

05:09.377 --> 05:10.878
(Packer)
Quick, somebody help!

05:10.911 --> 05:13.881
Help the man!
Ow, no, no!

05:13.914 --> 05:15.916
(Michael)
I can't believe
you're not going to be there.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.117
It's gonna be good.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.920
It's gonna be
a great bachelor party, man.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.789
(Packer)
I have a full day
of sales calls.

05:21.822 --> 05:22.823
You should get out of them.

05:22.856 --> 05:23.891
I can't.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.627
It's--it's the only time
he can do it.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.896
2:30 to 3:15.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.631
It's gonna be great.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.932
We're going to be doing
some darts,

05:31.965 --> 05:33.834
we're gonna be, uh,
grilling up some steaks.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.036
I got some pie...

05:36.069 --> 05:38.706
Going to be
very delicious...

05:38.739 --> 05:41.375
And what kind of stripper
did you get?

05:41.409 --> 05:44.978
I did not order
a stripper.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.414
Whaddaya mean,
you didn't order a stripper?

05:46.447 --> 05:48.482
Have you ever even been
to a bachelor party?

05:48.516 --> 05:50.017
[scoffing]
Yeah.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.619
[both laughing]

05:51.652 --> 05:53.387
Um...

05:53.421 --> 05:54.788
[hemming and hawing]

05:54.822 --> 05:56.524
Not personally, no.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.426
All right, Mike.
Okay?

05:58.459 --> 06:00.628
A stripper
is Bachelor Party 101.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.029
I know, I--
If you don't
get a stripper,

06:02.062 --> 06:03.497
your party
is gonna suck.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.165
I can't get a stripper here.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.600
Sexual harassment.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.835
[sighs]

06:07.868 --> 06:09.937
I just--
Get one for the girls, too.

06:09.970 --> 06:10.704
That evens it out.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.105
You know,
separate but equal.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.842
So that's what that means.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.110
Okay, everybody.
Slight change of plans.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.580
We are still going to be
having two parties,

06:19.613 --> 06:20.948
but each is going to get

06:20.981 --> 06:22.883
a little extra dose
of naugh-tay.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.017
Unh!

06:24.051 --> 06:25.419
[laughing]
All right!

06:25.453 --> 06:27.154
Unh!
Gay...

06:27.187 --> 06:29.022
(Dwight)
What?

06:29.056 --> 06:30.758
Okay, co-ed naked strippers
in this office.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.059
For realsies.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.694
Under no circumstance
should a man

06:33.727 --> 06:35.996
strip off his clothes
in this office.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.130
Shut up, Angela!

06:42.002 --> 06:43.036
(Pam)
Hey.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.938
Hey.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.776
Uh...

06:48.809 --> 06:50.077
Uh...

06:50.110 --> 06:51.945
Everything okay?

06:51.979 --> 06:53.146
Oh, yeah.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.515
Why?

06:54.548 --> 06:57.117
Well, you seem
a little tired.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.453
Oh.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.021
Yeah, well...

07:01.054 --> 07:04.458
I guess there's been
a couple of late nights.

07:04.492 --> 07:07.561
Karen and I
have been up talking.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.763
[Jim exhales]

07:09.797 --> 07:10.864
You should get more sleep.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.766
Yeah.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.901
I know I should.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.737
Never underestimate the power
of a good night's sleep.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.572
No, I'm sure you're right.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.008
When I get eight hours,
compared to, like, six hours...

07:21.041 --> 07:23.477
it's like,
big difference!

07:23.511 --> 07:24.645
Really?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.113
Oh, yeah.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.516
Gotta get your REM cycle.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.784
Going with the whole...

07:30.818 --> 07:33.020
sleeping...

07:33.053 --> 07:34.955
better than not.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.958
Good advice, Beesly.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.560
Thanks.
See you out there?

07:39.593 --> 07:41.929
Yeah.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.031
Don't fall asleep
at your desk.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.233
[under breath]
Oh, my God.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.001
Okay.
We are off.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.971
Ryan and I are going to go
get some supplies.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.975
And I need you
to handle...

07:55.008 --> 07:56.510
[quietly]
hiring the strippers.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.045
[whispering]
Absolutely not.

07:58.078 --> 07:58.879
[whispering]
I'm on it.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.981
Well, get on it,
and make it happen.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.016
Ruddy cheeks,
thick calves,

08:03.050 --> 08:04.885
no tats, no moles.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.554
No tats.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.255
No, tats.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.857
Of course I want--
(Jim)
Stop.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.191
That's disgusting.
Leave me alone

08:11.224 --> 08:13.026
and get the male stripper.
Fine.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.562
I knew you would, Nancy.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.896
Sally.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.698
Uh...no preference.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.000
Uh, what do you think,
a redhead or brunette?

08:21.001 --> 08:21.902
Blonde.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.938
Nice.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.975
Do you have
any blonde women?

08:29.309 --> 08:30.978
Hmm.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.814
[Michael giggling]

08:33.847 --> 08:35.583
He hasn't even
said a word yet.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.917
Just giggling.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.624
Gotcha.
[chortling]

08:43.657 --> 08:48.862
[cell phone playing
Chamillionaire's Ridin']

08:48.896 --> 08:50.864
Yes?
[Jim on phone]
You okay?

08:50.898 --> 08:52.700
I'm in the--
I'm in the sex shop.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.967
(Jim)
Ah, gotcha.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.969
[Michael snickering]

08:56.003 --> 08:56.970
Okay, so they have
Albert Einstein,

08:57.004 --> 08:59.106
Ben Franklin,
or SpongeBob SquarePants.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.708
SquarePants?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.643
Yep, SpongeBob SquarePants.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.012
And you think
that'd be sexy?

09:05.045 --> 09:05.979
Michael referred me

09:06.013 --> 09:10.050
to a male strip club
called Banana Slings.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.752
Instead, I called

09:11.785 --> 09:13.921
the Scholastic Speakers
of Pennsylvania.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.055
Ooh, ha ha!

09:15.088 --> 09:16.624
(man)
Hold the door, please!

09:16.657 --> 09:17.925
Oh.
Thank you.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.326
Ho ho. Hello.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.794
Hello.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.095
You wearing a thong?

09:22.129 --> 09:23.797
What?

09:23.831 --> 09:27.701
[laughing]

09:27.735 --> 09:29.102
Sparkling cider
is very good.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.638
I think that's champagne.

09:30.671 --> 09:33.707
Hello, ladies.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.876
Who here
is a history buff?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.878
Um...

09:37.911 --> 09:39.780
Who's a fan
of buff naked?

09:39.813 --> 09:40.948
[giggling]

09:40.981 --> 09:44.184
Without further ado,
the one,

09:44.217 --> 09:46.219
the only...

09:46.253 --> 09:48.188
the sexy
Mr. Benjamin Franklin.

09:48.221 --> 09:52.192
Thank you for that introduction,
Mr. Scott.

09:52.225 --> 09:55.262
And good afternoon,
fine gentlewomen

09:55.295 --> 09:57.698
of Dunder-Mifflin.

09:57.731 --> 09:58.899
(Michael)
Huh?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.068
Half pants, right,
Mr. Franklin?

10:01.101 --> 10:02.970
Knickers, in fact, yes.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.037
He's in his knickers.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.073
Mr. Franklin.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.140
Hmm?
I would say

10:07.174 --> 10:10.711
you were probably one of
the sexiest presidents ever.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.747
Well, actually,
I never was president.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.183
Yes, but Ben Franklin was.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.086
Ah.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.855
I am here to teach you
a little bit

10:21.889 --> 10:23.757
about my life.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.893
And the era
of the Founding Fathers.

10:25.926 --> 10:26.860
[suggestive grunt]

10:27.795 --> 10:30.397
And when they came over
on the Mayflower.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.100
Bow-chicka-bow.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.002
(Meredith)
Wait.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.236
This is the entertainment?

10:36.269 --> 10:37.771
Yeah.
All right.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.841
So I want you to give him
your undivided attention,

10:40.874 --> 10:41.909
and Mr. Franklin...
Hmm?

10:41.942 --> 10:44.244
If any of these ladies
misbehave,

10:44.277 --> 10:46.446
I give you permission
to spank them.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.948
Especially that one.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.888
Have you ever
seen a stripper before?

10:54.922 --> 10:56.256
[scoffing]
Yes.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.225
Jennifer Garner
portrayed one on Alias.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.060
It was one
of her many aliases.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.128
Yeah.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.429
Me neither.
Hey.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.897
Hi.
I'm Elizabeth.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.866
I'm the dancer
that was requested.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.868
Okay. Ha.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.437
I specifically ordered
a stripper.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.139
I'm the stripper.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.941
Oh.
Okay, good.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.243
Well, in future, please
identify yourself as such.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.045
Oh, God.
Okay...

11:18.078 --> 11:19.913
"Is she hot?"

11:25.185 --> 11:27.187
Text back,
"Kind of."

11:28.956 --> 11:32.926
It was a warm June evening
in 1752,

11:32.960 --> 11:34.895
the night of my fateful
kite flight.

11:34.928 --> 11:35.896
Mr. Franklin.
Yes?

11:35.929 --> 11:37.430
Do you have a girlfriend?

11:37.464 --> 11:39.833
I have a lovely wife.
Deborah.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.235
But don't you also
have girlfriends in Paris?

11:42.269 --> 11:43.470
(Karen)
Mm.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.905
(Pam)
Like, a lot of them?

11:44.938 --> 11:45.939
Ah, well, that

11:45.973 --> 11:48.776
is a gray area
of my life.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.410
Okay? So.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.780
It was a warm June evening...

11:52.813 --> 11:54.447
Look at that.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.918
Nothing like grilling
in the great outdoors.

11:57.951 --> 12:01.088
Is this the same grill
you grilled your foot on?

12:01.121 --> 12:03.156
No.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.424
Yes.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.326
Oh, gross.
But I got all the foot
off of it.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.929
Mm--
Okay, Ben Franklin.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.998
Ah--aha!

12:11.031 --> 12:14.835
Oh, Ben Franklin
tied a cherry stem in his mouth!

12:14.868 --> 12:16.770
Well, that is because
I am a Renaissance man.

12:16.804 --> 12:17.771
Ben Franklin?

12:17.805 --> 12:19.873
Hmm?
Do you wear boxers,

12:19.907 --> 12:21.174
briefs, or pantaloons?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.442
[chuckling]

12:22.475 --> 12:23.543
Well.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.913
You're very saucy.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.514
[chuckles]

12:27.547 --> 12:29.783
[both laughing]

12:29.817 --> 12:31.885
Guys! Beef!

12:31.919 --> 12:33.921
[stupid voice]
It's what's for dinner.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.023
Who wants some man meat?

12:36.056 --> 12:37.357
I do.
I want some man meat.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.792
Michael,

12:38.826 --> 12:40.360
Dwight would like
your man meat.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.495
Well, then,
my man meat he shall have.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.798
There you go.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.034
[robot voice]
Deliciousity.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.135
Of course.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.170
(Michael)
There we go.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.040
So I guess you have
the Ben Franklin wig,

12:53.073 --> 12:54.808
and the costume,
and you figure,

12:54.842 --> 12:56.476
"How could I put this
to practical use?"

12:56.509 --> 12:57.945
Well, I like to think
that his dad

12:57.978 --> 12:59.880
was a Ben Franklin
impersonator.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.582
And he really
pressured him into it.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.984
[laughing]

13:04.017 --> 13:06.820
Hey, um,
I wanted to talk to you.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.922
I-I know this is weird
or whatever,

13:08.956 --> 13:09.957
but, um...

13:09.990 --> 13:12.392
Jim told me
about you guys.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.594
What do you mean?

13:14.627 --> 13:16.163
Well, that you kissed.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.832
And we've talked it through,
and it's totally fine.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.600
It's not a big deal.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.836
It was just a kiss.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.973
Wait, you're not still...

13:26.006 --> 13:27.174
interested in him?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.976
Oh, yeah.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.011
Really.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.446
Oh, no.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.382
I'm--I was confused
by your phrasing.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.885
You should definitely
go out with Jim.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.186
I mean,
you're going out with Jim.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.553
I'm not going out
with Jim.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.955
[nervous chuckle]
You're dating him.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.090
Which is awesome,

13:43.123 --> 13:44.591
because you guys
are great together.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.493
'Kay.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.896
I'm not into Jim.

13:48.929 --> 13:49.897
Yeah.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.599
So, um...we're good.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.135
Yeah.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.569
Sorry.

13:56.603 --> 13:59.006
What are you sorry about?

13:59.039 --> 14:01.574
Um...

14:01.608 --> 14:02.976
What?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.177
What are you sorry about?

14:04.211 --> 14:05.979
Nothing.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.448
I was just thinking
of something else.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.952
Okay, the game is no-limit,
deuce to 7 lowball.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.586
Blinds 25-50.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.956
Nickels are worth 10,
dimes 25,

14:15.989 --> 14:16.957
and quarters 50.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.091
Nothing wild.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.559
Michael shuffle!

14:19.592 --> 14:21.294
Here we go.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.900
(Kevin)
Michael...

14:28.401 --> 14:30.303
Ah.
Gentlemen...

14:30.337 --> 14:32.405
The entertainment
is here.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.640
Everybody,
I'd like to introduce you

14:33.673 --> 14:35.342
to Elizabeth.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.609
Hi, guys.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.011
[Michael chuckling]
Nice outfit.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.647
I hear there's
an important meeting here.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.249
[Michael giggling]

14:42.282 --> 14:44.985
I'm not really into strippers.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.386
And--you know
what I find sexy?

14:46.419 --> 14:48.255
Pam's art.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.422
She's an artist.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.624
And I appreciate that.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.927
It's very moving.

14:53.961 --> 14:56.029
And...sexy.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.365
The art.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.333
Hit it.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.203
[Bad Company's
Feel Like Makin' Love plays]

15:03.236 --> 15:04.704
[Michael laughs]

15:04.737 --> 15:06.173
So where's the groom?

15:06.206 --> 15:07.975
Oh.
He is right there.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.509
There he is.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.577
Absolutely not.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.012
[clears throat]
That's all you.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.013
It's all you.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.248
Okay.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.950
All right, I'll do it.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.585
Yeah, let's do it.

15:18.618 --> 15:19.953
Let's do this thing.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.121
Yeah?

15:21.154 --> 15:22.689
What do I...
Just sit on down.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.524
All right.
All right.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.692
Okay.
And here we go.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.694
Oh, here we go.
All right.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.062
Yes.
Whoo!

15:29.096 --> 15:32.065
(Michael)
Not bad, not bad.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.034
You smell nice.
Like Tide.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.635
Mm, what's that?

15:35.668 --> 15:37.570
You smell like
Tide detergent.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.539
[loudly over the music]
Do you use

15:39.572 --> 15:40.673
Tide detergent?

15:40.707 --> 15:43.010
* Feel like makin' love
Shh.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.211
Ha ha!

15:44.244 --> 15:46.013
Whoo!

15:46.046 --> 15:47.647
I have a girlfriend,
so...

15:47.680 --> 15:50.083
I bet she'd be jealous.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.019
(Michael)
Yeah, she'd probably...

15:52.052 --> 15:53.720
Yes, she would be.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.288
You know what?
Okay. Excuse me.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.524
This--please.
Stop it, stop it.

15:57.557 --> 15:58.591
Turn off the music.
This is wrong.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.626
[music stops]
This is wrong!

15:59.659 --> 16:00.693
This is wrong.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.631
I have a girlfriend.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.066
Uh-uh.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.300
And you are engaged,

16:07.334 --> 16:08.135
and I'm sure you have

16:08.168 --> 16:10.270
a boyfriend
in prison or something,

16:10.303 --> 16:11.538
so...

16:11.571 --> 16:13.206
Let's just clear out,
okay?

16:13.240 --> 16:15.008
Shame on you.

16:16.709 --> 16:21.081
Go back to work!

16:21.114 --> 16:23.716
Elizabeth, I want you
to sit here.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.418
When the phone rings,
answer it.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.620
You want me
to answer phones

16:27.654 --> 16:29.289
with my clothes on?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.491
We hired you
for three hours' work.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.160
And we're gonna get it.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.599
Ooh, I love your poster.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.170
Thank you.

16:47.407 --> 16:51.111
[silently]

16:53.313 --> 16:55.482
You know,
I invented electricity.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.317
I know.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.385
Well, I'm sensing

16:58.418 --> 17:00.253
a little electricity
right here.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.390
Didn't Ben Franklin
have syphilis?

17:03.423 --> 17:04.391
[short laugh]

17:04.424 --> 17:06.826
Yes, but I don't.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.062
[laughs]
My name is Gordon.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.431
Oh.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.300
On one hand,
I want to be honest with Jan

17:13.333 --> 17:14.367
and tell her the truth.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.535
But on the other hand,

17:15.568 --> 17:17.137
I'm afraid
she's gonna dump me.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.172
You know, Michael,

17:19.206 --> 17:21.441
I fathered
an illegitimate son.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.210
Really.
But I kept all this

17:23.243 --> 17:25.178
from my wife, Deborah.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.281
These things only serve
to upset the women.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.550
They are the gentler sex.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.486
Wow.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.721
Ben Franklin,

17:34.754 --> 17:37.090
you're really
kind of a sleazebag.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.828
Stripper?

17:41.861 --> 17:43.363
Could I ask you
a question?

17:43.396 --> 17:46.099
About women?

17:46.133 --> 17:47.267
Um...

17:47.300 --> 17:51.104
Should I tell my girlfriend
that you danced up on me?

17:54.274 --> 17:57.710
Secret secrets are no fun.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.813
Secret secrets hurt someone.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.418
Wow.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.287
Thank you.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.624
Care for a piece
of chocolate?

18:11.658 --> 18:12.725
Chocolate!

18:12.759 --> 18:14.227
Where did you acquire it?

18:14.261 --> 18:15.828
That is a delicacy
in the Amazon,

18:15.862 --> 18:17.297
but it has not yet
been imported

18:17.330 --> 18:18.765
to the United States.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.368
Who was the king
of Austria?
Joseph II.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.403
Who was the king
of Prussia?
Friedrich Wilhelm III.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.271
Who was the king
of England?

18:24.304 --> 18:27.174
Why, the tyrant King George,
of course.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.475
I don't care
what Jim says.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.244
That is not
the real Ben Franklin.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.880
I am 99% sure.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.316
[Jan on speakerphone]
Michael, I left a meeting.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.717
What is so urgent?

18:37.750 --> 18:41.521
Are you...are you okay?

18:41.554 --> 18:43.156
Not really.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.225
Look, I don't know
how to say this,

18:45.258 --> 18:46.393
so I just will.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.427
(Jan)
Okay.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.796
I, um...

18:49.829 --> 18:52.399
went to a bachelor party.

18:53.466 --> 18:57.337
And things got
a little out of hand.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.507
Uh, when--when did--
When, last night?

19:00.540 --> 19:02.342
No, today at work.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.311
You went to a bachelor party
at work?

19:04.344 --> 19:06.379
Yes, I kind of arranged it.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.381
Well, I don't even think
the stripper was that hot.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.450
Do--do you guys
think she was hot?

19:10.483 --> 19:11.251
Kelly, don't do this.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.719
Do what?
I just asked you a question.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.254
You know
what you're doing.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.388
Anyway,
you know who was

19:15.422 --> 19:16.589
totally flirting
with Ben Franklin?

19:16.623 --> 19:18.325
Pam.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.692
Really?

19:19.726 --> 19:21.528
Looks like I hired
the right guy.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.662
I'm glad.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.464
Any real potential there,
Beesly?

19:24.497 --> 19:25.532
[Pam laughs]

19:25.565 --> 19:27.400
Yeah. Right.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.869
God, I need a boyfriend.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.904
Um...

19:31.938 --> 19:34.241
You know, Ryan,
I'm--I'm totally ready

19:34.274 --> 19:36.443
to be set up with one of
your business school friends.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.710
Whenever.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.212
(Ryan)
'Kay.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.415
Oh, my God.

19:42.449 --> 19:45.385
I would get so fat
if I worked here.
Yeah?

19:45.418 --> 19:47.420
I lose my appetite
all the time.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.989
You could strip,
you know.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.359
Thanks.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.227
So you don't want
to end our relationship?

19:54.261 --> 19:55.695
(Jan)
I'm closer to firing you.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.365
That is so sweet.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.700
You are the best
cheated girlfriend in the world.

20:00.733 --> 20:01.901
Do you know that?
[Jan sighs]

20:01.934 --> 20:03.303
You are.
I'll talk to you later.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.371
[Jan hangs up]
You are.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.774
So you know who turned out
to be kind of a creep?

20:07.807 --> 20:10.377
Ben Franklin.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.945
And...
Elizabeth, the stripper?

20:12.979 --> 20:14.581
Gave me great advice.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.416
Which rhymed.

20:17.650 --> 20:21.388
Really makes you wonder
how Ben Franklin

20:21.421 --> 20:22.522
can become president,

20:22.555 --> 20:27.594
but someone
like Elizabeth can't.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.861
Are you nearsighted
or farsighted?

20:28.895 --> 20:29.862
Both.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.999
That's why I invented
the bifocals.
Gaah!
