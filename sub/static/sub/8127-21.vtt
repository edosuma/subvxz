            your mother here.   

01:04.464 --> 01:05.897
            This whole thing is 
            your mother's fault.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.498
     You understand that, Edith?
     This is your fault.

Oh, Daddy, how could            
it be Ma's fault?               

01:09.102 --> 01:11.102
             Because the kitchen
             is her department.

            She's responsible

01:12.105 --> 01:13.304
                 that goes on

01:25.318 --> 01:26.517
                 You should have
                 been near it

02:16.603 --> 02:18.603

        back there at the house.

02:18.605 --> 02:19.904
            Maybe I could       
            have been killed.

05:19.352 --> 05:22.686
EDITH: Yeah,                    
what is it?                     

05:22.688 --> 05:25.589
  May I know what we're having  
      for supper tonight?       

05:25.591 --> 05:26.958
            Nothing!            

05:33.032 --> 05:34.299
    Oh, did she say nothing?    

05:34.301 --> 05:36.901
              The refrigerator's
              broken.           

05:36.903 --> 05:39.337
 Oh, the refrigerator's broken. 

05:39.339 --> 05:40.771
      Ain't that a shame?       

05:40.773 --> 05:44.008
     Ah, well, heaven knows     
    we had our money's worth    

05:44.010 --> 05:45.343
      out of that old box.      

05:45.345 --> 05:47.611
Hey! Hey! What kind             
of a dirty crack is that?       

05:49.781 --> 05:50.915
    What did I say, Michael?    

05:50.917 --> 05:52.783
        You insulted my husband!

05:54.286 --> 05:56.054
    Well, I hope not.           

05:56.056 --> 05:57.956
You're saying I'm the one       
that broke the refrigerator!    

05:57.958 --> 06:00.158
Well, I'm not the only one      
    that uses it, you know!     

06:00.160 --> 06:02.360
      I'm not the only one      
who eats around here, you know! 

06:02.362 --> 06:04.162
        You eat 10 times        
        as much as I do,        

06:04.164 --> 06:05.763
    so don't go making          
    dirty cracks like that!     

06:05.765 --> 06:06.764
         Michael's right, Daddy.

you two are taking me up wrong. 

06:27.787 --> 06:29.253
        I realize               
that there are four people      

06:29.255 --> 06:30.688
     using the refrigerator     
         in this house,         

06:30.690 --> 06:32.590
  and one of them's a student   
     who's doing brainwork      

06:32.592 --> 06:34.192
     and needs all the food     
          he can eat,           

06:34.194 --> 06:35.593
    and he's welcome to it.     

06:35.595 --> 06:37.761
        It's delightful         
to have a student in the house.

 I had a tape recording of you,

    some of the things

where the refrigerator is.

  Well, we're almost finished.  

22:08.160 --> 22:10.160
    All we have to do           
     is fix the loose wire.     

22:10.162 --> 22:11.961
            No, no, no, no,     
            I got a better idea.

22:11.963 --> 22:12.962
                  Just let      
                  it hang there.

22:12.964 --> 22:13.963
            Just let it hang.   

22:13.965 --> 22:15.165
              Pack up your tools
              and leave.        

22:15.167 --> 22:16.866
You mean                        
you want us to go?              

22:16.868 --> 22:18.669
          You want me           
    to spell it out for you?    

22:18.671 --> 22:21.738
        L-E-E-V. leave.         

22:23.007 --> 22:24.274
Okay, it's your money,          
Mr. Bunker.                     

22:24.276 --> 22:25.275
Pack it up, Jack.               

22:25.277 --> 22:26.276
             Right.             

22:26.278 --> 22:27.477
 I still have to charge you     

22:27.479 --> 22:29.012
          for a house call, $18.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.880
Oh, sure, sure,                 
well, I expected that.          

22:30.882 --> 22:33.083
Here we are,                    
one, two, three,                

22:33.085 --> 22:36.420
and eight, and 10               
is 18, all set.                 

22:36.422 --> 22:37.954
Goodbye, lady,                  

22:37.956 --> 22:39.889
and good luck.                  

22:39.891 --> 22:40.890
Bye, ma'am.                     

22:40.892 --> 22:41.958
    Bye, and thank you.         

22:41.960 --> 22:43.393
ARCHIE: Yeah,                   
thanks a million.               

22:43.395 --> 22:44.894
              Arch, what are you
              thanking them for?

22:44.896 --> 22:46.663
        You just spent          
        18 bucks for nothing.   

22:46.665 --> 22:47.964
For nothing?                    
No, no.                         

22:47.966 --> 22:49.366
For that 18 bucks,              
he showed me                    

22:49.368 --> 22:50.800
where the loose                 
wire is here.                   

22:50.802 --> 22:52.769
See? That's all                 
I have to know.                 

22:52.771 --> 22:55.239
  Now I'm going to save myself  
        some money              

22:55.241 --> 22:57.741
    by fixing up that           
    loose wire myself, huh?     

22:57.743 --> 22:58.942
             Arch, I don't know.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.344
             I don't think      
             you should do that.

23:00.346 --> 23:01.612
Will you keep                   
your mouth shut                 

23:01.614 --> 23:02.912
and keep                        
your eyes open,                 

23:02.914 --> 23:04.781
and maybe you'll                
learn something.                

23:21.032 --> 23:24.801
      MICHAEL: I don't think    
      you should have done that.

23:24.803 --> 23:26.603
And now it's going              
to cost you even more           

23:26.605 --> 23:28.805
when another repairman          
has to come tomorrow.           

23:28.807 --> 23:30.474
                 Don't blame me,
                 little girl.   

23:30.476 --> 23:32.976
    It ain't my fault.          
    It's your mother's fault.   

23:32.978 --> 23:35.044
     And you, Edith, that story 
     you was telling here.      

23:35.046 --> 23:36.045
        That ain't the truth.   

23:36.047 --> 23:37.213
Oh, yeah,                       
honest, Archie.                 

23:37.215 --> 23:39.616
That's the way                  
it really happened.             

23:39.618 --> 23:41.017
     Oh, wait a second, Ma,     
        not quite.              

23:41.019 --> 23:42.419
        Remember,               
Jack didn't really have a knife.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.454
  What are you talking about?   

23:44.456 --> 23:45.789
He had a big switchblade,       

23:45.791 --> 23:47.257
one of them Harlem gang knives. 

23:47.259 --> 23:48.692
          Did he, Ma?           

23:48.694 --> 23:51.027
Well, I guess                   
your father knows               

23:51.029 --> 23:52.529
what they call them.            

23:52.531 --> 23:53.963
            You're damn right   
            I know.             

23:53.965 --> 23:55.766
Well, I got                     
the knife with me.              

23:55.768 --> 23:56.767
I picked it up.                 

23:56.769 --> 23:58.067
Jack must have                  
dropped it                      

23:58.069 --> 24:00.036
when he was                     
picking up his tools.           

24:00.038 --> 24:01.571
Yeah, here it is.               

24:03.974 --> 24:07.143
             That's the terrible
             switchblade?       

24:07.145 --> 24:10.213
Archie,                         
when we was kids,               

24:10.215 --> 24:13.717
I think we called               
this a pen knife.               

24:13.719 --> 24:16.085
That's a switchblade, huh?      
Look at that thing.             

24:16.087 --> 24:17.521
It couldn't even                
cut butter.                     

24:17.523 --> 24:21.391
        Hey, Michael, you said  
        that there was no knife.

24:23.661 --> 24:24.795
Did I say that?                 

24:24.797 --> 24:25.962
                  Yeah, that's  
                  what you said.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.096
                  Yeah, you did.

24:27.098 --> 24:28.131
                You're as bad   
                as Daddy.       

24:28.133 --> 24:29.499
            You're as bad as me.

24:31.436 --> 24:32.803
Wait a second,                  
wait a second.                  

24:32.805 --> 24:34.604
All right, so I got             
the knives mixed up,            

24:34.606 --> 24:36.005
but the way                     
you talk about it,              

24:36.007 --> 24:37.040
it was a machete.               

24:37.042 --> 24:38.508
            I didn't say nothing
            about a machete.    

24:38.510 --> 24:41.077
    Don't be bringing           
    the spics into this here.
