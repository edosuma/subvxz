WEBVTT

00:43.960 --> 00:45.939
(Cockerel crows)

01:15.400 --> 01:17.379
Come on. (Whistles)

01:30.160 --> 01:33.823
I applaud your foresight.
It's as well to be prepared.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.979
For what?

01:36.160 --> 01:38.025
Any encounter?

01:38.200 --> 01:40.828
With those who might...wish us ”I.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.869
Ross Poldark would not dare lay a finger on me.

01:44.040 --> 01:47.305
- Even though we tried to get him hanged?
- We failed. Did you forget?

01:47.480 --> 01:50.859
Ah! But on that score,
there are other ways to choke a man.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.263
And ifthe rumours about his finances are true,
it shouldn't be difficult.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.829
I look forward to hearing of your progress.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.506
- (Knocking at door)
- Yes.

02:09.680 --> 02:14.140
Beggin' 'ee pardon, Cap'n, sur.
'Tis a letter for 'ee, sur, if it please 'ee, sur.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.983
Ah, the ole Trevorgie workings?
'Tis a fine thought, sur.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.865
What is?

02:25.040 --> 02:27.304
Whatever 'ee was thinkin', sur.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.381
I'm thinking ofthrashing you from here to Sawle.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.820
Aye, sur. Well, whatever 'ee say, sur,
much obliged, sur...

02:40.400 --> 02:44.461
I write to remind you that your loan of 1 ,000

02:44.640 --> 02:48.098
_ with interest at 40%
IS shortly due for repayment.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.259
Yourfriend, Harris Pascoe.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.785
All I need.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.939
What is?

02:56.200 --> 02:58.065
Jud.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.788
His grovelling is killing me.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.665
Are you away somewhere?

03:05.840 --> 03:09.219
To Truro.
For the Wheal Leisure shareholders' meeting.

03:09.640 --> 03:14.987
Oh, just since the trial, I've scarce seen you,
let alone had time to speak.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.939
You always seem about
some business or other.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.099
The mine? The harvest?

03:21.120 --> 03:23.099
Would you have me neglect our affairs?

03:23.280 --> 03:25.783
- No, Ross.
- We'll talk soon. I promise.

04:12.600 --> 04:17.060
Gentlemen, welcome to the quarterly meeting
ofthe Wheal Leisure shareholders.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.220
Now before we begin, I must make you aware

04:20.400 --> 04:25.622
that Mrs Jacqueline Tregidden
has sold her shares to a Mr Coke.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.748
Since Mrs Tregidden has always trusted us
to do our business without her interference,

04:29.920 --> 04:32.184
let's hope this gentleman will do the same.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.339
- (Clears throat)
- (Knocking)

04:36.160 --> 04:38.025
Good day t'you, gentlemen.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.065
My name is Tankard.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.458
Acting on behalf of Mr Coke.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.145
Mr Warleggan, more like.

04:45.320 --> 04:50.064
Pray go on with the business, sir.
I'm most eager to hear what you have to say.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.425
Oh, shield your eyes, my boy!

04:59.600 --> 05:02.148
The dazzle ofWarleggan livery can blind a man!

05:02.320 --> 05:05.187
George has invited us to a soire.
I've sent our regrets.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.339
No, no. No. No, surely not?

05:08.360 --> 05:13.138
Pray convey our delight
in declining his invitation.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.382
Now then, boy,
would you like to do your lessons...

05:22.320 --> 05:24.299
- ..or help me in the fields?
- The fields!

05:24.480 --> 05:26.584
The fields is the correct answer!

05:49.320 --> 05:52.505
Gentlemen, it's been four years
since we opened Wheal Leisure.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.820
We started with 50 men, now we employ 100.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.709
We're not prosperous,
but we consistently show a small profit.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.188
We're not getting fat on it.

06:01.360 --> 06:05.581
But that could change if another lode of copper
could be found. Mr Henshawe?

06:05.760 --> 06:07.387
(Clears throat)

06:07.560 --> 06:11.542
'Tis er...common knowledge
that the ancient Trevorgie workings,

06:11.720 --> 06:14.905
abandoned half a century ago
when the owner died

06:15.080 --> 06:16.547
were never worked out.

06:16.720 --> 06:22.386
The old shafts caved in long ago.
'Tis impossible to reach from above grass.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.539
But if you look at this old map,

06:24.720 --> 06:27.427
and compare it with the current map
ofWheal Leisure workings

06:27.600 --> 06:32.139
you'll see that we've extended considerably
in the direction of Trevorgie.

06:32.320 --> 06:38.338
My proposal is this: we divert our quarterly
profits into starting an exploratory tunnel

06:38.520 --> 06:42.786
to see ifwe can join up the old Trevorgie
workings and access the untapped copper.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.746
And who's to do the digging?

06:44.920 --> 06:47.707
Will it take men away
from the day-to-day workings?

06:48.560 --> 06:51.620
Can you guarantee that copper will be found?

06:51.800 --> 06:54.143
How will this affect my client's dividends?

06:54.320 --> 06:57.744
As you know, sir,
there are no guarantees in mining.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.787
_ Mr Henshawe
WIII personally superwse the venture.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.986
A small team, including myself,
will be led by Zacky Martin.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.622
And we take on six extra men to cover them.

07:11.120 --> 07:15.386
Well, I can't see the harm of it.
I doubt their wages'll bankrupt us!

07:15.560 --> 07:17.585
Ye can be sure ofthat!

07:17.760 --> 07:20.149
I'm in favour.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.299
Who's with me?

07:28.400 --> 07:31.460
Motion carried.
Mr Aukitt and Mr Tankard declined.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.619
(Galloping horse approaching)

07:44.880 --> 07:46.745
Captain McNeil!

07:46.920 --> 07:50.708
Mistress Poldark! Have you recovered
from your husband's ordeal?

07:51.760 --> 07:53.819
I give thanks daily for his acquittal, sir.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.979
Doubtless he's a wiser man for it?

07:56.920 --> 07:58.785
No more sailing close to the wind?

07:58.960 --> 08:01.144
- You know Ross.
- Mm.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.584
- Is he home?
- In town.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.468
I'm in the neighbourhood
at the behest of Unwin Trevaunance,

08:07.640 --> 08:10.143
advising on matters of local security.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.904
But I trust I may drop in and take a glass of rum
with my old army comrade?

08:14.080 --> 08:16.264
Or indeed my old comrade's wife.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.379
- Allow me, ma'am.
- Oh.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.619
Thank you.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.548
George Warleggan
finally has a spy in the camp.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.585
It was bound to happen eventually.

08:33.760 --> 08:39.300
But provided the other shareholders hold firm,
Tankard and George can be kept in check.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.620
It's the last thing 'ee need now,
with all the rumours goin' about.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.746
- Rumours? _
- The parlous state 0' your finances?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.468
Have people nothing better to gossip about?

08:51.280 --> 08:54.499
You'll have to excuse me, gentlemen.
I'll see you tonight at the mine.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.784
When's the last time 'ee took a day off?

08:57.760 --> 08:59.739
When I sat in jail, awaiting trial.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.865
Cap'n Ross be 'ome soon, I bla'.

09:09.040 --> 09:13.227
I hope so, seeing as Captain McNeil
has called 'specially to see him.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.345
Hmm!

09:18.640 --> 09:20.619
Your health, ma'am.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.184
In truth, 'twas also you I wished to see.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.544
On account of your skill at cow doctoring.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.585
I've no such thing, sir.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.069
Sir Hugh Bodrugan has heard different.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.219
His prize cow Sheba is sick.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.466
He'd esteem it the greatest offavours

09:40.640 --> 09:43.222
if you'd cast your eye over the beast
and prescribe a remedy.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.867
He asked for you particularly.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.146
- I don't doubt it.
- May I tell him that he need not hope in vain?

09:50.640 --> 09:51.709
Captain McNeil?

09:51.880 --> 09:55.145
An ambush, sir!
Caught off guard and in possession ofthe field!

09:55.320 --> 09:57.185
How are you, sir?

09:57.360 --> 09:59.419
On manoeuvres hereabouts?

09:59.600 --> 10:03.422
Quartered with Sir Hugh at Werry House.
Whither I'm attempting to lure your wife.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.905
To what end?

10:07.080 --> 10:10.823
Sir Hugh wants me to tend to his cow,
though I say I've no skill.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.423
Can I persuade you
to lend your wife to such a cause?

10:15.600 --> 10:17.659
Demelza has a mind of her own, sir,

10:17.840 --> 10:22.379
but since she has a special fondness
for Sir Hugh, no doubt she'll be over directly.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.540
Ifyou'll excuse me,
I have mine figures to attend to.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.985
Look, Horace, what beastly little hovels.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.139
Who could bear to live here?

10:42.800 --> 10:45.428
I urge you to quit this place
and come to London,

10:45.600 --> 10:48.103
then loathsome sights need not distress you.

10:50.560 --> 10:54.542
I did not say I found
all the sights loathsome hereabouts.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.019
Well done, my boy.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.542
He's not been right
since he returned from Bodmin.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.779
He is changed.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.619
And I do not know how or why.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.459
But we must be glad of it.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.986
Elizabeth Poldark "regrets".
This is Francis's doing.

11:38.960 --> 11:43.738
Why er...waste your time on these people?
Surely Unwin is of more use?

11:43.920 --> 11:46.582
Unwin is proving less of an asset than I'd hoped.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.618
All manner of promises
made in exchange for votes

11:49.800 --> 11:51.586
and I'm beginning to fear they're wasted.

11:51.760 --> 11:55.389
What's the use of having an MP in your pocket
if he's too obtuse to do your bidding?

11:55.560 --> 11:57.425
He is pliable.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.465
Is that not an asset?

11:59.640 --> 12:04.145
Only if yoked to wit and intelligence,
which in this case it is not.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.185
How was the meeting?

12:06.360 --> 12:07.782
- Illuminating.
- Tell me.

12:07.960 --> 12:13.387
But first, summon Tom Harry. There's another
small matter regarding Poldark's manservant.

12:13.560 --> 12:18.384
When 'Is Worshipfulness the judge
he says to me, "Mester Paynter", he sez...

12:19.760 --> 12:22.103
"Did this man do wrong or no?"

12:23.000 --> 12:26.060
And I sez, "Sithee Your Honourableness,

12:26.240 --> 12:32.907
Ross Poldark is as_ innocent
as a newly-dropped babe In Its first wettels."

12:33.080 --> 12:36.823
And sez 'Is Majestic Horribleness...

12:37.600 --> 12:40.740
"Mester Paynter, 'tis your testimony...

12:41.560 --> 12:46.338
..an' your testormy alone 'ave set this man free."

12:49.600 --> 12:53.149
Did you mislay your manners?
Leavin' me alone to deal with our guest?

12:53.320 --> 12:55.299
You appeared to be handling him admirably.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.789
- I felt like an intruder.
- Meaning what?

12:58.520 --> 13:03.469
Demelza, do you really suppose
he wants you to cure Bodrugan's cow?

13:03.640 --> 13:05.505
He makes his intentions very plain.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.069
I think I ought to be able to judge that for myself.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.425
No doubt you think so,
just be careful his uniform doesn't dazzle you.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.058
- It has that effect on some people.
- Especially a common miner's daughter?

13:15.240 --> 13:17.026
That's for you to demonstrate.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.589
You are detestable sayin' that.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.062
- I'm sure I didn't start this argument.
- No, but you never do!

13:23.240 --> 13:25.026
You just give me the cold shoulder
and sour looks

13:25.200 --> 13:28.704
an' despise everything that isn't
up to your high-an'-mighty standards!

13:31.240 --> 13:33.026
(Barking)

13:40.000 --> 13:43.185
- What 'ee bin sayin' t'upset the maid?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.979
Demelza?

13:57.280 --> 13:58.941
Are you well?

13:59.120 --> 14:00.587
Quite well, thank 'ee.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.627
I came in search of Garrick.
He scented a rabbit an'...

14:03.800 --> 14:06.303
Garrick! Garrick, come to!

14:06.880 --> 14:08.859
Is Ross recovered from the trial?

14:09.800 --> 14:11.745
He rarely speaks of it.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.145
And your news? The child?

14:17.320 --> 14:18.867
Is he pleased?

14:20.240 --> 14:22.219
Not exactly.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.905
You've not told him.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.059
He don't wish for another.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.899
Since Julia, he...

14:36.600 --> 14:38.579
..he haven't the heart for it.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.579
And we're to blame.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.625
'Tis not my b'lief.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.459
It's good of you to say so.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.903
But the fact that there's still discord
between our families.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.629
There is. An' I think 'twill not be lightly set aside.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.265
By Ross at least.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.579
Garrick!

15:38.800 --> 15:42.782
When we strike,
it must be clean and swift and out of sight.

15:42.960 --> 15:46.179
Giss on, man, you're talkin' to the master now.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.018
Gentlemen. A good night's work?

16:23.200 --> 16:26.180
A good deal nearer Trevorgie
than this time yesterday.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.147
- Go home and get some rest.
- None ofthat for the wicked!

16:29.320 --> 16:34.587
It's home to breakfast then away to Truro.
My finances require urgent attention.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.903
(Door opens and closes)

16:59.000 --> 17:00.979
- Demelza?
- Ross.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.025
(Sighs) You first.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.179
No, you.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.545
I want to apologise.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.143
I've been distracted of late.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.022
But there are things
I've been wishing to say to you.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.179
- And I you.
- About our finances.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.223
Oh.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.585
My shares in Wheal Leisure
are the only thing of value we have.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.264
I've begun work in this new tunnel to try
and improve our chances ofthe mine

17:25.440 --> 17:28.864
becoming more profitable,
but still, our own coffers are almost bare.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.905
It doesn't need to be like that.

17:31.080 --> 17:34.186
You're head purser at the mine.
Why won't you take a wage?

17:34.360 --> 17:36.828
I prefer to plough every last penny into the mine.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.026
We have, however, a more pressing concern.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.907
Last year I asked Pascoe
to find me a loan of1 ,000.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.019
The interest at 40% is due this week.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.061
400?

17:51.240 --> 17:53.105
Yes.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.901
How is half such a sum to be found?

17:58.960 --> 18:00.939
What's to be done?

18:02.120 --> 18:07.467
Ride to Truro, see if Pascoe's managed
to get the loan extended for another year?

18:08.520 --> 18:13.583
In the meantime, the more I work in the mine,
the better our chances of reaching Trevorgie.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.505
And the interest?

18:16.680 --> 18:17.988
Look about you.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.139
See what you can bear to part with.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.619
Then look again.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.662
Ah, Mistress Demelza.

18:49.080 --> 18:52.538
- Have you come to steal my heart?
- (Laughs)

18:52.720 --> 18:55.587
- No, sir. I've come to visit your cow.
- Oh.

19:01.400 --> 19:06.178
It wasn't easy but I've secured agreement
for your loan to be extended for another year.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.908
At the same exorbitant rate.

19:09.560 --> 19:14.748
Provided...this year's interest
is forthcoming tomorrow.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.065
A mere 400.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.219
Quite so.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.385
She d'look fair sick, Sir Hugh.
What treatment has she had?

19:24.560 --> 19:30.180
Well, all manner of blisters, clysters,
salves and poultices. All to no avail.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.903
But I've no doubt you'll offer better advice.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.379
I will.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.299
Start afresh with a better beast.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.062
- How went the shareholders' meeting?
- Well enough.

19:44.240 --> 19:48.301
- But for the appearance of a new shareholder.
- Tankard? The Warleggan proxy?

19:48.480 --> 19:50.141
You heard.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.220
Are they on a mission to own the company?

19:52.400 --> 19:54.265
No, sir.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.067
Just to own me.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.788
This cow you speak of, your Emma...

19:58.960 --> 20:01.144
Oh, she's our pride an' joy, sir.

20:01.320 --> 20:06.144
So we could not let her go
except at a goodly price.

20:06.320 --> 20:09.221
Oh, well, not ifthe rumours be true.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.224
Your husband's financial difficulties?

20:14.400 --> 20:18.461
Of course I...I'm always happy to help a friend.

20:18.640 --> 20:22.861
And I could be persuaded
to pay the "goodly price"...

20:23.880 --> 20:25.745
..ifthe terms were right.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.627
And what terms would you require?

20:28.800 --> 20:32.861
Oh, merely a...a kind of interest.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.587
Payable here and here.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.899
- And here!
- Sir Hugh! You forget yourself!

20:37.080 --> 20:39.742
- On the contrary.
- Judas, I think my dog has better manners!

20:39.920 --> 20:42.184
- Woof! Woof!
- Sir Hugh.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.419
I believe you're wanted at the house.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.465
Urgently.

20:47.640 --> 20:50.268
Hmm. (Chuckles)

20:56.200 --> 20:58.179
Sir Hugh's a mite unruly sometimes.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.784
Should you decide to brave his company again,

21:01.960 --> 21:06.021
I will personally undertake to protect you
from his enthusiasm.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.819
I'm much obliged, sir.

21:10.040 --> 21:13.305
I'm not overjoyed to think of Sir Hugh
in possession of Emma.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.984
No, nor I, but you said she must be sold
and I've secured a buyer.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.100
So what else must go?

21:20.280 --> 21:23.226
Well, not the oxen.
Without them we cannot plough.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.145
But the pigs, the chickens.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.185
- The clock.
- The carpet.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.225
The settle.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.379
At least one chair.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.619
My brooch is worth 100.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.779
That was a gift.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.179
But it may need to be sold in the end.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.946
I wonder what Garrick
could fetch on the open market?

21:52.120 --> 21:54.623
One overgrown mongrel? Carnivorous.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.189
- Crockery breaker.
- And stealer of pies.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.379
D'you suppose there'd be any takers?

22:01.680 --> 22:03.659
(Rumble ofthunder)

22:10.520 --> 22:12.499
(Chickens clucking)

22:49.400 --> 22:51.743
May I fetch you anything from market, Uncle?

22:51.920 --> 22:53.865
You're going in with Unwin, are you?

22:54.040 --> 22:56.668
Good Lord, no.
I'm in need of some sensible conversation.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.785
Well, then, Hicks must escort you.

22:58.960 --> 23:03.306
Caroline, you cannot be roaming
about the countryside unaccompanied.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.021
No, Uncle.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.464
But if I were to go, what could I bring you?

23:09.800 --> 23:12.428
Sugared almonds? Marzipan?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.989
You spoil your old uncle.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.422
(Both chuckle)

23:21.000 --> 23:22.979
(Market traders call out)

23:39.520 --> 23:41.499
(Chatter)

23:58.040 --> 24:00.019
Dr Enys!

24:01.760 --> 24:03.625
What a lucky encounter.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.665
How are you, Miss Penvenen?

24:05.840 --> 24:08.820
I have a tingling in my throat.
Do you think it could be serious?

24:09.000 --> 24:12.458
I very much doubt it.
You seem otherwise in the peak of health.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.100
I hope it's not morbus strangulatorius?

24:16.280 --> 24:18.623
If it were the putrid throat, you'd soon know it.

24:18.800 --> 24:22.861
Is that what Ross Poldark's daughter had?
He's not exactly blessed with luck, is he?

24:23.040 --> 24:26.339
No. And that doesn't seem about to change.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.820
How humiliating it must be for him.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.584
- Less for her, I suppose.
- I doubt either ofthem see it that way.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.140
Would you excuse me, ma'am?
I have patients to see to.

25:01.600 --> 25:08.904
(Soundtrack over dialogue)

25:18.840 --> 25:20.819
Mistress Poldark.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.859
Ross.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.465
How are you?

25:27.640 --> 25:31.144
You don't look at all well.
Can it be the anxieties ofthe trial?

25:36.600 --> 25:40.104
- Could you have had some disappointment?
- None that I know of.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.379
Perhaps it is yet to come.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.627
Ross.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.065
How did you manage it?

25:59.240 --> 26:03.142
It was quite straightforward.
We sold pretty much everything we own.

26:15.360 --> 26:18.944
You see, a real horse is much better
than a hobby horse, is it not?

26:20.280 --> 26:23.738
Why does Uncle George not visit us any more?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.779
Uncle George is not our friend.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.419
Is Uncle Ross our friend?

26:31.400 --> 26:33.425
In time...

26:34.120 --> 26:35.508
in time I hope he will be.

26:39.040 --> 26:42.419
You're quite the favourite with Mrs Tabb
these days. She cannot abide Dr Choake.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.262
I suspect she prefers
the cheapness of my remedies.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.226
Or possibly their efficacy?

26:47.960 --> 26:51.418
Aunt Agatha,
Dr Enys has agreed to take tea with us.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.899
You know how she loves to hear
ofthe latest dread diseases.

26:56.800 --> 27:00.907
Is it my imagination
or is Francis in better spirits these days?

27:01.080 --> 27:03.105
Scrofula. That's it.

27:03.280 --> 27:07.580
Great purple blotches
and swellings ofthe neck.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.947
Since the trial, you would not know him.

27:12.800 --> 27:15.064
I cannot tell if it's because Ross was saved

27:15.240 --> 27:17.982
or if something happened
while he was in Bodmin.

27:18.160 --> 27:21.664
He shared your room...the night before the trial.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.944
Did you notice any strangeness
in mood or behaviour?

27:26.120 --> 27:28.099
Not that I can recall.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.146
Something he said, I had the feeling...

27:33.200 --> 27:35.065
You may think me callous or hysterical,

27:35.240 --> 27:39.142
but I could almost believe that Francis
had intended to kill himself.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.379
Did he?

27:47.800 --> 27:50.587
Whatever occurred, be glad of it.

27:50.760 --> 27:53.228
He came to town a broken man.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.345
He returned...

27:55.520 --> 27:57.465
like that.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.379
(Rustling)

28:18.600 --> 28:20.704
Mr Paynter!

28:20.880 --> 28:22.939
Who, sur? Me, sur?

28:23.800 --> 28:25.427
Nay, not I, sur.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.785
You will recall the bargain
we struck some time ago?

28:28.960 --> 28:30.825
Bargain?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.865
I never struck no such thing.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.905
I don't hold with 'em, does I?

28:35.080 --> 28:38.709
In exchange for testifying against Ross Poldark.

28:38.880 --> 28:42.304
Nay, p'raps I do recall something.

28:44.440 --> 28:50.185
Thinkin' it over, I wasn't meself in court.
Mebbe it slipped my mind.

28:51.520 --> 28:55.866
In which case 'tis on'y fair
to give 'ee back yer guineas.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.019
- Ten, were it?
- 15.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.659
But that is not what we have come for.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.981
For what, then?

29:03.560 --> 29:04.822
This.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.501
Argh!

29:10.840 --> 29:11.909
(Jud groans)

29:12.080 --> 29:14.059
(Beating continues)

29:16.600 --> 29:18.465
You see much of Ross and Demelza?

29:18.640 --> 29:20.619
Why do you ask?

29:21.640 --> 29:26.543
I so wish our families could be reconciled,
but Ross is determined to keep his distance.

29:27.320 --> 29:31.188
I wonder...might I ask you to speak to them
on our behalf?

29:32.040 --> 29:33.780
What could I say?

29:33.960 --> 29:38.101
Francis is to give a supper when the harvest
is in to our tenants and friends.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.908
Would you ask Ross and Demelza to join us?

29:41.080 --> 29:43.742
To stay the night? You, too, are most welcome.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.065
I'll happily carry the invitation.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.947
I cannot guarantee how it will be received.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.379
DEMELZA: Sorry, it's not much.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.825
Mmm.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.379
Ross...

30:11.120 --> 30:15.580
I've been wantin' to speak of somethin',
but haven't yet found the right moment.

30:15.760 --> 30:18.228
- Surgeon's 'ere.
- Oh!

30:18.400 --> 30:20.868
- Dwight.
- Hope 'ee's eaten afore!

30:21.040 --> 30:22.905
Admiring our harvest?

30:23.080 --> 30:24.707
I hope to augment it.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.541
With an invitation.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.506
Oh?

30:28.680 --> 30:30.659
From Trenwith.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.779
Obviously we won't accept.

30:42.120 --> 30:45.863
Surely we can't forget
that it's thanks to them that we lost Julia?

30:46.520 --> 30:48.909
Or that George is still their bosom friend?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.309
- Is he?
- You'd have us overlook it?

30:52.480 --> 30:55.984
Have I said that? No, in truth,
I'm in no haste to go to Trenwith.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.545
Then we're in accord.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.142
It do appear so.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.299
(Prudie shrieks)

31:07.480 --> 31:09.345
He'm dead!

31:09.520 --> 31:12.262
He'm dead. He'm mortal dead!

31:20.000 --> 31:21.865
Who could have done such a thing?

31:22.040 --> 31:24.304
He 'ad no enemies.

31:24.480 --> 31:29.702
He were the sweetest, kindliest,
most peaceable cove a body could meet.

31:30.960 --> 31:34.020
An' ne'r a cross word did pass 'is lips.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.062
An' now I left a widow, all forlorn,

31:39.240 --> 31:41.219
without a penny in the world...

31:42.720 --> 31:45.063
..not e'en to bury the poor soul, God rest it!

31:45.240 --> 31:47.219
There is this.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.108
When we moved 'im, they fell out of his pockets.

31:51.280 --> 31:54.101
Gold sov'reigns? Gold sov'reigns?

31:54.280 --> 31:56.703
- Where'd 'ee get such...?
- Where indeed?

31:58.760 --> 32:03.106
Why, the mizzerly, mazzerly stinkin', black worm!
He had 'em about 'im an' never tell'd me?

32:03.280 --> 32:06.260
- Reckon 'tis from the Trade?
- That's unlikely.

32:06.440 --> 32:09.147
I'll knock 'im sideways
down Stippy-Stappy Lane!

32:10.200 --> 32:12.179
Then give 'im a rare good buryin'.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.579
Rum an' vittles...

32:17.400 --> 32:21.541
..hymns an' viols,
widow's weeds for poor ole Prudie.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.708
'Tis a matter of lookin' respectable, 'tis.

32:29.560 --> 32:32.108
We must send the ole man offfitty ways.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.584
ROSS: I've known him since I was a child.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.460
He was the most useless servant under the sun.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.944
But he taught me to smoke a pipe...

32:49.000 --> 32:50.979
..and cheat at Loo.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.579
They left the money.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.340
Yes?

33:01.520 --> 33:03.385
Then it was no random attack.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.539
What, then?

33:06.800 --> 33:08.665
Vengeance?

33:08.840 --> 33:11.024
- What for?
- You were In court.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.861
You heard his original statement.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.019
He was ready to testify against me.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.539
But then he did not.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.867
What if he was paid to speak against me -

33:24.040 --> 33:27.385
hence the 15 guineas,
and then changed his mind?

33:38.800 --> 33:40.859
ROSS: George has played us all.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.780
Would George wreck all that we have?

33:45.800 --> 33:48.542
The family, the business, and now our servant?

33:48.720 --> 33:50.540
That seems to be his aim.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.104
DEMELZA: Can we do nothing?

33:54.280 --> 33:57.420
ROSS: It suits George
to have myself and Francis at odds.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.860
Perhaps we should accept
the invitation to Trenwith.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.740
DEMELZA: Are you sure, Ross?

34:04.920 --> 34:06.899
Some things cannot be mended.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.939
But some can.

34:35.640 --> 34:36.709
(Cries out)

34:36.880 --> 34:38.666
(Elizabeth laughs)

34:55.960 --> 34:57.507
This is your doing?

34:57.680 --> 34:59.819
You're not displeased?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.779
Far from it.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.779
Cousin.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.779
It's an unexpected pleasure.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.579
Thank you for bringing him.
It means the world to Francis.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.025
You look well, cousin.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.219
- Demelza.
- FranCIs.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.379
Welcome.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.904
I'a
ve 'nl
.I'
a
ve 'n
!

35:53.080 --> 35:54.945
-I'ave'n!
ALL: What 'ave 'ee?

35:55.120 --> 35:56.985
What 'ave 'ee? What 'ave 'ee?

35:57.160 --> 35:59.025
A neck! A neck!

35:59.200 --> 36:01.179
- A neck!
ALL: Hurrah!

36:01.360 --> 36:03.339
Hurrah! Hurrah!

36:24.240 --> 36:26.219
Elizabeth.

36:27.240 --> 36:31.188
I was expecting a small, private gathering.

36:31.360 --> 36:34.500
Instead I find myself ambushed by san-culottes.

36:34.680 --> 36:38.264
Hardly, Mama.
These are our tenants and friends.

36:38.440 --> 36:42.547
Trust me, a few crusts will not curry favour
when they turn on you.

36:42.720 --> 36:45.746
Ask the Marquis de Launay,
ifyou can find his head.

36:47.400 --> 36:50.221
You look radiant, mater-in-law.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.662
- Are you quite well, Francis?
- Never better.

36:55.960 --> 36:58.428
Come, then, friends!
Shall we have some dancing?

36:58.600 --> 37:00.465
Yes, I think we shall.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.619
(Jaunty tune)

37:36.320 --> 37:38.504
I ordered you to scare him,
not assassinate him.

37:38.680 --> 37:40.898
- Tom got a little carried away.
- This is disastrous.

37:41.080 --> 37:44.948
- You think Poldark will know who's behind it?
- I wouldn't be surprised if he's outside now!

37:45.120 --> 37:46.860
(Knocking)

37:49.520 --> 37:53.069
How d'you like my new coat? I ordered my tailor
to make it the double of Prinny's!

37:53.240 --> 37:55.105
You most definitely need one, George.

37:56.760 --> 38:00.787
Well, can we go to the Penvenen party?
My intended will be impatient to see me.

38:00.960 --> 38:03.224
By all means.

38:05.400 --> 38:08.028
RAY PENVENEN: Caroline? (Knocks)

38:08.200 --> 38:09.986
Come in.

38:11.600 --> 38:15.707
Caroline, my dear? Are you ready yet?
Our guests will be arriving soon.

38:15.880 --> 38:17.745
I have such a pain.

38:17.920 --> 38:21.344
But Tom Choake was here just now.
Did he not bleed you?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.662
Would you have me submit to his butchery?

38:25.800 --> 38:27.859
So what do you propose?

38:30.400 --> 38:34.268
FRANCIS: This is the last bottle ofthe '83.

38:34.440 --> 38:37.182
After that, we'll have to resort to cheap gin.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.068
Did you hear I quarrelled with George?

38:42.240 --> 38:44.105
No.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.145
What was the cause?

38:46.320 --> 38:48.823
Oh, these things tend to sink in slowly.

38:49.680 --> 38:52.740
At first you barely notice,
and then one day you wake up to the realisation

38:52.920 --> 38:55.741
that the man who has been
your frIend for years...

38:56.360 --> 38:58.066
..is a complete and utter blackguard.

38:59.760 --> 39:03.344
Well, I don't disagree. Indeed, I strongly believe
he's behind the assault on Jud.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.943
- What will you do?
- Till I can prove it...

39:06.120 --> 39:07.985
nothing.

39:08.160 --> 39:10.105
But when I do...

39:10.280 --> 39:12.419
- A letter for you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.506
Someone taken ill at Killewarren.

39:18.680 --> 39:20.819
Tell them to be ill at a more convenient time.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.459
It's a complaint ofthe throat.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.102
I must go.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.145
Elizabeth, where's my port?

39:28.320 --> 39:33.144
Lady Whitworth says that fashions in London
and Bath are now verging on the indecent.

39:33.320 --> 39:35.459
What exactly does that mean?

39:35.640 --> 39:37.380
Bosoms.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.506
Acres of 'em -
exposed lIke capons on a platter!

39:42.960 --> 39:45.099
You look pale, child.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.384
- Are you unwell?
- No.

39:47.560 --> 39:51.018
No, that is, I believe
I may be sickenin' for something.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.464
Get Elizabeth to mix you a rouge.

39:54.120 --> 39:57.226
Elizabeth goes out so seldom,
she has no need of it.

39:57.400 --> 40:01.188
It's criminal that this should be the highlight
of your social calendar, Elizabeth.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.669
I know I would be driven quite mad

40:03.840 --> 40:08.504
had I only farmhands and kitchen maids
to converse with.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.866
If you'll beg my pardon,
I must take a breath of air.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.259
(String quartet plays)

40:36.600 --> 40:39.148
Damn it, I'm partial to a harvest supper.

40:39.320 --> 40:43.381
_ Gladdens the heart
to enjoy the frUIts of one's own labours!

40:43.560 --> 40:47.587
Remind me when you were last in your fields
with a scythe, sir?

40:48.920 --> 40:50.785
Is Miss Penvenen not here?

40:50.960 --> 40:53.463
Nor her uncle. Most irregular.

40:53.640 --> 40:55.619
Invited to supper and not a sign ofthe hosts.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.665
Shall we hunt them down?

40:57.840 --> 40:59.705
Ah, McNeil, what news?

40:59.880 --> 41:03.862
Can we rest easy in our beds,
knowing you've purged the district of violence?

41:04.040 --> 41:05.905
I lay claim to no such thing, sir.

41:06.080 --> 41:09.299
Only last night
we had a murder on our doorstep.

41:09.480 --> 41:12.426
- Surely not?
- Captain Poldark's manservant.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.898
Paul Daniel? Where 'ee be?

41:16.080 --> 41:19.459
Do 'ee go draw the spigot
on the next keg o' brandy.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.188
I've an urge to address the conflagration!

41:26.360 --> 41:31.866
Jud Paynter... 'ee were a whited sepulchre.

41:33.480 --> 41:37.143
But now 'ee's passed on
to flowery fields and green meads.

41:38.000 --> 41:44.109
When Paul Daniel come back,
we'll raise a toast an' send 'im on his way.

41:44.760 --> 41:46.625
- 'Ee's gone.
- We know that, fool!

41:46.800 --> 41:49.223
From his slab! 'Tis empty!

41:49.400 --> 41:50.628
The corpse ain't there!

41:54.000 --> 41:55.979
(Screams)

42:04.480 --> 42:06.459
(Woman approaching wailing)

42:15.680 --> 42:18.740
- What is it? What is it?
- 'Tis they body-stealers!

42:19.560 --> 42:21.539
They've robbed me o' my ole man!

42:23.320 --> 42:25.299
Oh.

42:26.440 --> 42:28.419
(Laughter and chatter)

42:42.280 --> 42:44.066
Ah.

42:45.120 --> 42:48.749
My niece has been ill for three days.

42:48.920 --> 42:52.265
Dr Choake attended her, of course,
but she grows worse

42:52.440 --> 42:54.658
and she insisted on sending for you.

43:01.600 --> 43:04.501
Did Dr Choake attempt a diagnosis?

43:04.680 --> 43:06.227
Quinsy.

43:06.400 --> 43:08.618
- With or without fever?
- Without.

43:08.800 --> 43:11.428
- But she can hardly swallow.
- Is it the putrid throat?

43:11.600 --> 43:13.864
That we will shortly ascertain.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.139
Will you open your mouth? Please?

43:44.200 --> 43:46.668
Might a servant fetch me
some warm water and salt?

43:46.840 --> 43:48.467
I'll see it done directly.

43:49.880 --> 43:53.668
I think I might be able to help you,
but you must keep absolutely still.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.819
Can you do that?

43:56.960 --> 43:58.825
- Adams or Wyatt?
- For what?

43:59.000 --> 44:02.140
Our house in London.
Caroline will want the latest thing.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.185
She can well afford it.

44:04.360 --> 44:06.225
I wonder whether it shouldn't be Wyatt?

44:06.400 --> 44:08.868
His Pantheon in Oxford Street
has pleasing dimensions.

44:09.040 --> 44:13.147
Perhaps you'd better secure the lady
before you start spending her fortune.

44:14.200 --> 44:16.179
Mr Aukitt.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.741
Excuse me.

44:18.920 --> 44:21.866
Remind me,
do you still have shares in Wheal Leisure?

44:22.040 --> 44:23.268
Yes, I do.

44:24.600 --> 44:26.989
May I tell you a secret?

44:28.040 --> 44:29.985
Old Fred Pendarves.

44:30.160 --> 44:33.027
He's a mine captain
at Grambler in my father's day.

44:34.600 --> 44:37.546
For a month now
I've had him prospecting over my land.

44:38.600 --> 44:40.465
To what end?

44:40.640 --> 44:43.507
Ross, you know I'll never make a farmer.
It's mining.

44:43.680 --> 44:46.547
Mining. It's what I keep coming back to.

44:47.920 --> 44:49.899
That's what he wanted for me.

44:52.400 --> 44:56.063
God knows he'd be as surprised as me to think
that any ofwhat he taught me had sunk in.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.219
But...that's the truth of it.

44:59.120 --> 45:01.099
We must start mining again.

45:02.600 --> 45:06.184
Don't let me deter you,
but even a hole in the ground costs money.

45:08.200 --> 45:11.499
I have money. A few hundred put by.

45:11.680 --> 45:15.104
Ifthings had gone badly at the trial,
I would have given it to Demelza.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.827
Now I'm...

45:17.000 --> 45:21.539
I'm minded to spend it
on a final attempt to secure my own destiny.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.465
If only to spite George.

45:25.640 --> 45:31.863
I think the best revenge is to succeed
in your own right, despite his interventions.

45:32.040 --> 45:34.019
Almost there.

45:35.480 --> 45:36.902
- (Gasps)
- All done.

45:37.080 --> 45:39.389
Now rinse your mouth with salt water.

45:48.200 --> 45:50.179
It'll get easier now.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.979
What did you do?

45:57.480 --> 45:59.789
When did you last eat fish, Miss Penvenen?

46:01.000 --> 46:02.865
Three days ago.

46:03.040 --> 46:05.019
You must be more careful in future.

46:06.440 --> 46:08.305
A fish bone.

46:08.480 --> 46:10.869
Can I do anything for Horace while I'm here?

46:17.800 --> 46:19.381
WOMAN: Whoops!

46:19.560 --> 46:22.302
- Mr Aukitt?
- Can you help?

46:22.480 --> 46:25.506
- What ails him?
- A fatal gamIng encounter.

46:25.680 --> 46:27.659
I doubt you can save him. (Laughs)

46:29.360 --> 46:31.305
- The ladies have deserted us.
- Yes.

46:31.480 --> 46:34.222
ROSS: Perhaps we bore them.
- Perhaps.

46:38.600 --> 46:42.058
I think I must go to bed.
I find I'm less able to hold my liquor these days.

46:42.240 --> 46:43.821
No, no, stay, finish your drink.

46:47.800 --> 46:49.062
Thank you, cousin.

46:49.240 --> 46:51.140
For what?

46:53.000 --> 46:55.503
I never thought to see you under my roof again.

46:57.720 --> 46:59.699
I never thought to be here.

47:17.440 --> 47:19.419
(Wails)

47:22.800 --> 47:24.779
(Sobs)

47:29.600 --> 47:31.465
'Tis the shame of it!

47:31.640 --> 47:36.509
To 'ave an husband, an' to not 'ave an husband.
I'll never live it down.

47:36.680 --> 47:38.545
Ssh now.

47:38.720 --> 47:42.383
Then there's the buryin'.
'Ee can't 'ave a buryin' without a body.

47:43.120 --> 47:44.587
No.

47:44.760 --> 47:47.661
So not only am I' robbed of a husband,

47:47.840 --> 47:51.059
I'm robbed o' the pleasure
of seein' 'im planted in the ground!

47:51.960 --> 47:53.188
(Gasps of shock)

47:53.360 --> 47:54.987
(Gasps)

48:09.200 --> 48:13.705
- Miss Penvenen, I trust you are on the mend?
- I believe I am, sir.

48:17.080 --> 48:18.661
Ah.

48:19.520 --> 48:21.101
Have I missed all the fun?

48:21.280 --> 48:24.181
You appear to have had some of your own.

48:24.360 --> 48:28.148
Oh. It must be the ride and the night air.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.459
- Was it the putrid throat?
- Thankfully not.

48:31.400 --> 48:35.985
I did have to sedate William Aukitt though.
He was so agitated he could barely speak.

48:36.160 --> 48:38.025
What ailed him?

48:38.200 --> 48:40.065
A fit ofthe Warleggans?

48:40.240 --> 48:42.982
He'd been talking to George,
and before he knew it,

48:43.160 --> 48:45.822
he'd signed away some shares
in a mining venture.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.218
He did not specify Wheal Leisure.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.379
Did George look happy?

48:51.280 --> 48:52.508
Yes.

48:55.760 --> 48:58.149
So 'ee was lyin' on the table...

48:59.160 --> 49:05.542
And I wakes up in me winding sheet
wi' a terrible thirst, dreamin' o' gin.

49:05.720 --> 49:10.908
So off I carts to Jake's kiddley for some ale,
an' what 'appens?

49:11.080 --> 49:16.188
Ther's all up an' screaming like stuck pigs,

49:16.360 --> 49:19.227
and fallin' o'er each other to get out the door.

49:19.400 --> 49:22.380
So in I goes, drink me fill...

49:24.040 --> 49:25.905
..an' when I come 'ome to Prudie...

49:26.080 --> 49:27.945
An' what do I find?

49:28.120 --> 49:31.499
All fligged out in fancy widow's weeds.

49:31.680 --> 49:34.820
An' folk-feastin' an' drinkin', at my expense.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.948
An' nought left
but a jug o' brandy an' a windin' sheet!

49:39.120 --> 49:42.783
Tidn' fit, tidn' right, tidn' fair, tidn' proper!

49:42.960 --> 49:49.820
Truly I say unto thee,
a prophet is never honoured in 'is own land.

50:12.160 --> 50:14.549
Oh! Ross.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.540
I thought everyone had retired.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.585
I thought so, too.

50:18.760 --> 50:20.182
Is Demelza about?

50:20.360 --> 50:24.706
I think she was feeling unwell and went up early.
I thought I'd clear up.

50:25.360 --> 50:27.339
Let me help you.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.025
I must thank you for coming.

50:40.200 --> 50:42.065
It was a good day.

50:42.240 --> 50:44.105
Heaven knows how we've paid for it.

50:44.280 --> 50:46.145
But Francis was insistent.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.743
The Poldarks have fallen low.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.303
You must be sorry you married into the family.

50:53.320 --> 50:55.584
Do you think I should answer that?

50:55.760 --> 50:57.739
Perhaps I should not have asked it?

51:11.440 --> 51:13.829
Francis tells me he has some money put by.

51:15.080 --> 51:17.867
I'm surprised
he doesn't use it for this household.

51:18.040 --> 51:20.258
Oh, no, he's quite adamant.

51:20.960 --> 51:25.181
It's a "special sum"
to be used for a "special purpose".

51:25.360 --> 51:28.625
- Does George know he has it?
- George gave it to him.

51:30.200 --> 51:32.065
Did he?

51:32.240 --> 51:35.027
In recompense for his gaming losses
to Matthew Sanson.

51:35.200 --> 51:38.067
- D'you believe that?
- Should I not?

51:38.720 --> 51:41.029
George is not known for his philanthropy.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.103
But Francis is changed.

51:49.600 --> 51:51.465
Yes.

51:51.640 --> 51:53.460
And you, I think.

51:53.640 --> 51:54.948
For the better?

51:55.120 --> 51:56.985
I wouldn't go that far.

51:57.160 --> 52:00.061
I remember a time you were already perfect.

52:01.200 --> 52:03.179
To me, I mean.

52:07.280 --> 52:09.145
ELIZABETH: That was long ago.

52:09.320 --> 52:11.299
And you've been more than happy since.

52:11.480 --> 52:13.459
With Demelza.

52:13.640 --> 52:15.619
And you've grown up.

52:16.640 --> 52:18.505
Not too much, I hope.

52:18.680 --> 52:20.659
Today in the fields...

52:21.240 --> 52:23.265
you looked like a girl of 16.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.539
Your age when I first knew you.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.139
These past months have changed me...

52:34.000 --> 52:37.140
..has made me appreciate
what I have rather than what I lack.

52:37.320 --> 52:39.185
ROSS: It's very wise.

52:39.360 --> 52:43.023
After all, there's no point thinking about
what might have been.

52:46.200 --> 52:48.942
But you and I
would never have been happy together.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.826
Our characters are too different.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.979
True.

52:54.040 --> 52:57.498
But cannot love overcome such obstacles?

53:00.400 --> 53:02.425
And surely there's a greater impediment.

53:02.600 --> 53:05.785
You're a lady.
You could never have played the scullery maid.

53:06.640 --> 53:09.507
- Perhaps I have hidden talents.
- I don't dispute that.

53:10.560 --> 53:14.109
For somehow you've managed
to bring the light back to Francis's eyes.

53:14.280 --> 53:16.259
I cannot imagine how.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.979
Can you not?

53:30.400 --> 53:32.379
You should go to bed, Ross.

53:34.800 --> 53:37.303
Demelza will be thinking you've gone astray.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.379
Good night, then.

54:05.720 --> 54:07.699
You're awake?

54:09.000 --> 54:10.627
I thought you'd retired long ago.

54:10.800 --> 54:12.779
I went out.

54:13.800 --> 54:15.665
Out?

54:15.840 --> 54:17.705
Prudie came.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.859
Jud's alive.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.865
What?

54:23.040 --> 54:25.179
At least until Prudie do kill 'im again.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.339
Jud's alive?

54:29.200 --> 54:31.065
What happened? How?

54:31.240 --> 54:34.107
Oh, ask me tomorrow. I'm weary to the bone.

54:38.320 --> 54:40.185
Are you sure?

54:40.360 --> 54:42.339
I did see him with my own eyes.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.459
Elizabeth looked well tonight.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.419
She did.

54:56.200 --> 54:58.589
Her mother thinks
that were she not wed to Francis,

54:58.760 --> 55:01.103
she'd have halfthe aristocracy at her feet.

55:01.280 --> 55:03.259
But she is wed to Francis.

55:04.240 --> 55:06.424
And she seems content to be so.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.539
Do you remember our last visit here?

55:16.360 --> 55:18.339
That Christmas?

55:20.160 --> 55:22.139
When you first told me you loved me.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.979
And you told me you were with child.

55:30.480 --> 55:32.459
'Twas different then.

55:33.680 --> 55:35.659
You were glad I was with child.

55:37.480 --> 55:39.823
We were in our first days of love.

55:41.400 --> 55:44.142
And you would never have
looked twice at another woman.

55:45.200 --> 55:47.179
Oh, Demelza...

55:48.920 --> 55:52.868
_ What man does not
occaSIonally look at another woman?

55:53.040 --> 55:56.146
Or woman occasionally look at another man?

55:57.000 --> 55:59.104
And what man or woman of sense

55:59.280 --> 56:03.102
does not have qualms
about bringing a child into the world?

56:12.000 --> 56:13.979
Demelza?

56:14.680 --> 56:16.659
Yes, Ross?

56:23.200 --> 56:24.667
Yes, Ross.

56:24.840 --> 56:28.981
An' I know that you don't want it.
An' I know its just another burden to you.

56:29.160 --> 56:33.062
But there's no preventing it now,
so all we can do is...

56:33.240 --> 56:35.105
How long have you known?

56:35.280 --> 56:37.145
Since the trial.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.579
Good God.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.185
- And not to tell me?
- You said you didn't want another after Julia.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.669
Nor did I. Nor do I.

56:49.680 --> 56:53.309
The very thought of it, a child to grow
into our hearts and then be lost to us again?

56:53.480 --> 56:55.789
Could you bear it?

56:55.960 --> 56:57.939
I could not.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.184
But if a child is coming...

57:07.000 --> 57:08.979
..that's different.

57:14.760 --> 57:16.739
A child is not a thought.

57:18.200 --> 57:20.179
It is flesh and blood.

57:22.080 --> 57:24.184
And if you can risk your heart again...

57:26.000 --> 57:27.979
I can.

57:32.440 --> 57:34.419
Then so can I.
