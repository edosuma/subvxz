Try to keep
up, Howard!

00:15.091 --> 00:17.508
I'm killing it!

00:17.510 --> 00:20.077
Yeah, I wish we looked
as cool dancing in clubs

00:20.079 --> 00:22.246
as we do right now.

00:22.248 --> 00:25.082
Don't worry, this is
exactly how you look

00:25.084 --> 00:26.750
when you're dancing in clubs.

00:26.752 --> 00:30.071
You're welcome, ladies.

00:30.073 --> 00:33.307
Paradigm-shifting
news, gentlemen!

00:33.309 --> 00:34.809
(music stops)
Dude!

00:34.811 --> 00:37.395
I was about to Bollywood
this bitch.

00:37.397 --> 00:40.431
Earlier today, I invited

00:40.433 --> 00:42.766
Professor Stephen Hawking
to join me

00:42.768 --> 00:45.319
in the popular online game
Words with Friends.

00:45.321 --> 00:49.040
Moments ago,
he accepted my request.

00:49.042 --> 00:50.774
Do you understand
what that means?

00:50.776 --> 00:52.793
That somewhere right now
Stephen Hawking is saying,

00:52.795 --> 00:55.379
(imitating Stephen Hawking):
"Damn it.

00:55.381 --> 00:57.614
I meant to click no."

00:59.418 --> 01:01.168
I'll walk you through it.

01:01.170 --> 01:04.888
The game is not called
Words with Strangers.

01:04.891 --> 01:06.507
No, it's not
even called

01:06.509 --> 01:08.009
Words with Acquaintances.

01:08.011 --> 01:09.377
It is called

01:09.379 --> 01:11.679
Words with...

01:13.532 --> 01:14.965
I'm not finishing your sentence.

01:14.967 --> 01:16.633
You pulled the plug on my funk.

01:16.635 --> 01:18.552
Friends!

01:18.554 --> 01:20.304
It's Words with Friends!

01:20.306 --> 01:21.772
Which Stephen
Hawking and I

01:21.774 --> 01:22.973
officially are.

01:22.975 --> 01:25.443
Now all I need is
a bunk bed with a slide;

01:25.445 --> 01:26.861
I'll have everything
I've ever wanted

01:26.863 --> 01:29.080
since I was six years old.

01:29.082 --> 01:30.197
That's really nice,
Sheldon.

01:30.199 --> 01:31.282
I'm happy for you.

01:31.284 --> 01:33.150
And I'm happy for you, too.

01:33.152 --> 01:34.535
You are now friends with someone

01:34.537 --> 01:37.121
who is officially friends
with Stephen Hawking.

01:37.123 --> 01:38.289
Enjoy it, boys.

01:38.291 --> 01:39.757
You may have peaked.

01:40.826 --> 01:42.626
Sheldon, I know
Stephen Hawking.

01:42.628 --> 01:43.995
I worked with him.

01:43.997 --> 01:45.846
And if they ever come out
with a game called

01:45.848 --> 01:47.181
Words with People
You Once Worked with,

01:47.183 --> 01:48.482
you'll be off to the races.

01:50.302 --> 01:51.936
Sheldon, I don't think
this actually means...

01:51.938 --> 01:52.887
(tablet chimes)

01:52.889 --> 01:54.171
Hold that thought!

01:54.173 --> 01:56.774
Professor Hawking
has made a move.

01:56.776 --> 01:58.442
Boy, oh, boy.

01:58.444 --> 02:00.027
Oh, it's only a matter of time

02:00.029 --> 02:02.947
before we're coming up with
fun nicknames for each other.

02:03.882 --> 02:05.666
I'll be Coop.

02:05.668 --> 02:09.235
He'll be Wheels.

02:09.238 --> 02:12.022
If he's okay with that.

02:13.075 --> 02:14.809
All right.

02:14.811 --> 02:17.211
Crank up the AC, boy!

02:50.429 --> 02:52.397
So, I was taking
a shower this morning,

02:52.399 --> 02:54.549
and when I got out, I
started to dry off with

02:54.551 --> 02:57.202
what I thought was a towel
but turned out to be

02:57.204 --> 02:59.604
Howard's mom's underwear.

03:03.359 --> 03:06.277
I had to take another shower.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.764
It wasn't enough.

03:11.584 --> 03:15.003
Nothing will ever be enough.

03:15.005 --> 03:17.305
I once looked in Sheldon's
underwear drawer.

03:17.307 --> 03:18.473
He yelled at me.

03:18.475 --> 03:20.708
But now I know
what it looks like

03:20.710 --> 03:23.344
and he can never take that away.

03:23.346 --> 03:24.462
There's a book
under here.

03:24.464 --> 03:25.463
Oh, I'll get that.

03:25.465 --> 03:27.065
I got it. I got it.
No, no, it's...

03:27.067 --> 03:29.684
Why do you have
a history textbook?

03:29.686 --> 03:31.352
It's not a big deal.

03:31.354 --> 03:32.337
Just taking a class

03:32.339 --> 03:34.522
at the Pasadena
Community College.

03:34.524 --> 03:35.773
That's great.

03:35.775 --> 03:37.442
I didn't know you wanted
to go back to school.

03:37.444 --> 03:38.860
It's just one history class.

03:38.862 --> 03:40.161
Look, I didn't finish college,

03:40.163 --> 03:41.829
so I thought
I would give it a try.

03:41.831 --> 03:43.814
Not to mention,
your acting career

03:43.816 --> 03:46.067
is going south like Sherman.

03:47.870 --> 03:50.622
Read about it in your book.

03:51.724 --> 03:53.992
Why would you be embarrassed
to tell us?

03:53.994 --> 03:54.959
No, I'm not embarrassed.

03:54.961 --> 03:56.211
I just didn't want
anyone to know

03:56.213 --> 03:57.428
because I haven't
told Leonard yet.

03:57.430 --> 03:58.880
Why wouldn't you tell Leonard?

03:58.882 --> 04:00.598
Because it's me
going back to school,

04:00.600 --> 04:03.384
and he's gonna be all "you can
do it," and "how can I help?"

04:03.386 --> 04:04.669
and "I'm so proud of you."

04:04.671 --> 04:06.621
Ugh!

04:07.940 --> 04:09.474
I just can't believe you could

04:09.476 --> 04:10.942
keep something like that
from him.

04:10.944 --> 04:14.178
You guys have got to be
the weirdest couple I know.

04:19.584 --> 04:21.452
Really?

04:22.738 --> 04:26.708
You can't think
of anyone weirder?

04:26.710 --> 04:28.710
I can,

04:28.712 --> 04:30.995
(whispers):
but she's sitting right there.

04:35.417 --> 04:36.751
Yes!

04:36.753 --> 04:40.421
I play the word "quiver "
with a triple letter

04:40.423 --> 04:44.008
and a double word
score for 72 points.

04:44.010 --> 04:47.345
That ought to let the air
out of your tires, Hawking.

04:49.064 --> 04:52.383
Wow, my boyfriend is friends
with Stephen Hawking

04:52.385 --> 04:54.986
and my new dandruff shampoo
doesn't smell like tar.

04:55.938 --> 05:00.141
Everything really is
coming up Amy.

05:00.143 --> 05:02.160
It is glorious.

05:02.162 --> 05:04.696
One of the greatest intellects
of our time

05:04.698 --> 05:08.232
has agreed to engage with me
in a gentlemanly battle of wits.

05:08.234 --> 05:10.001
And I'm spanking him so hard

05:10.003 --> 05:13.738
his grad students
won't be able to sit down.

05:13.740 --> 05:16.174
You know, when one male
dominates another,

05:16.176 --> 05:18.042
his testosterone level rises.

05:18.044 --> 05:19.677
What's your point?

05:19.679 --> 05:23.531
It's exciting to think you might
be getting a testosterone level.

05:28.220 --> 05:29.687
(tablet chimes)
Ooh!

05:29.689 --> 05:33.491
My friend Stephen just played
the word "act" for 18 points.

05:33.493 --> 05:36.394
That's right, I call
him Stephen now.

05:36.396 --> 05:40.031
Because I checked, and he
was not okay with Wheels.

05:40.033 --> 05:43.701
Oh, you could turn
his "act" into "extract,"

05:43.703 --> 05:45.520
and it would be
for double points.

05:45.522 --> 05:46.821
Amy.

05:46.823 --> 05:48.373
Why would you
give me a word?

05:48.375 --> 05:51.326
Now, if I play "extract"
it would be cheating.

05:51.328 --> 05:52.160
Sorry.

05:52.162 --> 05:54.162
Although, I could play

05:54.164 --> 05:58.516
the completely unrelated
and better word "extract"

06:00.285 --> 06:03.137
Ethical conundrum
avoided.

06:03.139 --> 06:06.507
Thanks, brain.

06:07.676 --> 06:10.094
Spaghetti okay?

06:10.096 --> 06:11.929
It's crunchy.

06:11.931 --> 06:14.766
Just the way
I like it.

06:14.768 --> 06:19.153
Yeah, I don't think
the water was really boiling.

06:19.155 --> 06:20.922
It's great. I love it.

06:20.924 --> 06:22.240
(chuckles)

06:22.242 --> 06:24.609
Okay, listen, there's something
I need to tell you.

06:24.611 --> 06:27.829
I've been thinking about going
back to school for a while now.

06:27.831 --> 06:30.314
So a couple months ago,
I started taking a history class

06:30.316 --> 06:31.416
at the community college.

06:31.418 --> 06:32.817
Oh.

06:32.819 --> 06:35.086
That's great!
Great, great, great!

06:35.088 --> 06:36.938
Why wait so long
to tell me?

06:36.940 --> 06:39.374
I don't want you
to make a big deal out of it.

06:39.376 --> 06:40.758
Why do you think
I'd be like that?

06:40.760 --> 06:42.427
I get it, you're taking
one class. It's nice.

06:42.429 --> 06:43.494
Maybe if it goes well,

06:43.496 --> 06:44.629
you take another,
you enroll full-time.

06:44.631 --> 06:45.847
Ooh, be sure to
keep an eye on

06:45.849 --> 06:48.399
which credits transfer
to a four-year college.

06:48.401 --> 06:50.918
You're making it a big deal.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.387
Sorry. Whatever.

06:52.389 --> 06:54.889
It's all good.

06:54.891 --> 06:55.940
Anyway, that's it.

06:55.942 --> 06:57.225
I just thought
you should know.

06:57.227 --> 07:00.094
Am I allowed to ask
how the class is going?

07:00.096 --> 07:01.312
It's really good.

07:01.314 --> 07:03.064
We've been talking about
the origins of slavery.

07:03.066 --> 07:04.348
Turn in
my first paper tomorrow.

07:04.350 --> 07:06.016
Great topic. I can
help with that.

07:06.018 --> 07:08.035
There are lots of different
perspectives you can take:

07:08.037 --> 07:09.537
economic, sociological,
political...

07:09.539 --> 07:11.522
Hey, this is my paper.

07:11.524 --> 07:15.192
And my perspective
is that slavery is bad.

07:16.862 --> 07:18.195
Oh, and my professor's black,

07:18.197 --> 07:20.264
so I'm pretty sure
that's the right answer.

07:21.049 --> 07:23.050
Can I take a look?

07:23.052 --> 07:25.586
No, Leonard,
this is my thing.

07:25.588 --> 07:27.221
Okay, I get it.

07:27.223 --> 07:28.723
Thank you.

07:28.725 --> 07:30.341
It's like when I
started doing chin-ups;

07:30.343 --> 07:34.112
I didn't want you to see
until I could do one.

07:34.114 --> 07:37.582
FYI, really close.

07:37.584 --> 07:39.383
Thank you.

07:39.385 --> 07:40.902
Now behave yourself
and eat your dinner.

07:40.904 --> 07:41.903
Maybe later, if you're lucky,

07:41.905 --> 07:43.438
you get to sleep with
a college girl.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.522
Really?

07:44.524 --> 07:46.190
'Cause I went to
four years of college

07:46.192 --> 07:48.659
and five years of grad school,
that never happened once.

07:51.764 --> 07:54.749
I think the next time I have to
speak to a call center in India,

07:54.751 --> 07:58.035
I'm going to try using
an American accent.

08:00.372 --> 08:01.873
Why?

08:01.875 --> 08:04.258
Because when I use
my regular voice,

08:04.260 --> 08:06.811
I feel like
I'm making fun of them.

08:09.264 --> 08:10.848
That's ridiculous.

08:10.850 --> 08:13.184
Not to mention, your
American accent is terrible.

08:13.186 --> 08:15.303
Dude, my accent is brilliant.

08:15.305 --> 08:17.388
(American accent): Hey,
my snow-white American friends,

08:17.390 --> 08:19.190
let's put some cow meat
on the barbecue

08:19.192 --> 08:22.977
and eat it
until we're all obese.

08:22.979 --> 08:24.729
This is what you sound like.

08:24.731 --> 08:26.280
(imitating Koothrappali):
I think I'm talking

08:26.282 --> 08:28.816
in an American accent,
but it really sounds like

08:28.818 --> 08:31.986
I'm wearing a set
of giant dentures.

08:31.988 --> 08:34.956
Sheldon, do I really
sound like that?

08:34.957 --> 08:37.325
(imitating Koothrappali):
Tell him he sounds like that.

08:39.160 --> 08:40.812
Sheldon, you okay?

08:40.813 --> 08:43.898
It's been three days.

08:43.900 --> 08:47.185
Why hasn't Stephen
Hawking played a word?

08:48.720 --> 08:49.954
The guy's a genius.

08:49.956 --> 08:51.956
Maybe you weren't
challenging enough for him.

08:51.958 --> 08:53.257
Not challenging?

08:53.259 --> 08:54.959
I was humiliating
the man.

08:54.961 --> 08:57.645
I was thinking of writing a
book called <i>A Brief History of</i>

08:57.647 --> 09:00.898
the Time I Made Stephen Hawking
<i>Cry Like a Little Girl.</i>

09:00.900 --> 09:03.518
There's the problem.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.302
You can't beat Hawking
like that.

09:05.304 --> 09:06.521
He hates to lose.

09:06.523 --> 09:08.689
Everyone knows the
guy's a big baby.

09:08.691 --> 09:12.527
I mean, forget the wheelchair,
he should be in a stroller.

09:14.746 --> 09:16.447
Really?

09:16.449 --> 09:18.332
One time when I was
working with him,

09:18.334 --> 09:21.335
he said that Johnny Depp
was in <i>The Matrix.</i>

09:21.337 --> 09:24.121
I told him he was wrong,
but he kept insisting.

09:24.123 --> 09:26.624
So I looked it up
online and showed him.

09:26.626 --> 09:29.510
Well, the next day,
he had a pizza party,

09:29.512 --> 09:33.464
and everyone got invited but me.

09:34.182 --> 09:35.550
And then he was all,

09:35.552 --> 09:37.602
(imitating Stephen Hawking):
"Your invitation must have

09:37.604 --> 09:41.105
gotten lost in the matrix."

09:43.742 --> 09:46.644
Good Lord,
what have I done?

09:46.646 --> 09:49.113
(American accent):
Good Lord, what have I done?

09:51.984 --> 09:54.285
Terrible.

09:54.287 --> 09:57.688
All right, hotshot,
let's hear your Indian.

09:57.690 --> 09:59.523
(Indian accent):
I can't sit on that elephant,

09:59.525 --> 10:03.694
ass is on fire
from eating all this curry.

10:07.132 --> 10:08.966
Okay, yeah, that's pretty good.

10:30.555 --> 10:32.523
Please be good.

10:32.525 --> 10:34.692
Please be good.

10:38.647 --> 10:40.531
Uh-huh.

10:42.367 --> 10:45.603
Uh-huh.

10:45.605 --> 10:47.605
Okay.

10:47.607 --> 10:50.808
She writes like she cooks.

10:59.002 --> 11:01.253
Play.

11:01.255 --> 11:03.705
Play. Play.

11:03.707 --> 11:05.340
Play.

11:05.342 --> 11:07.209
Play.

11:07.211 --> 11:08.626
What are you doing?

11:09.479 --> 11:11.430
Trying to use a Jedi mind trick

11:11.432 --> 11:13.682
to control Stephen Hawking.

11:14.517 --> 11:15.550
Play.

11:15.552 --> 11:17.569
Play.

11:17.571 --> 11:18.820
Oh...

11:18.822 --> 11:22.541
He must be wearing
a tinfoil hat or something.

11:22.543 --> 11:24.860
I did a bad thing.

11:24.862 --> 11:26.378
Does it affect me?

11:26.380 --> 11:27.329
No.

11:27.331 --> 11:29.647
Then suffer in silence.

11:29.649 --> 11:31.283
Play.

11:31.285 --> 11:34.786
Play. Play.

11:34.788 --> 11:36.654
(knocking)
Stephen Hawking...

11:36.656 --> 11:40.075
Stephen Hawking...
Stephen Hawking.

11:40.927 --> 11:43.211
Penny started taking a class.

11:43.213 --> 11:44.996
She wrote a paper,
she didn't want me to read it,

11:44.998 --> 11:46.664
I went behind her back
and I read it anyway.

11:46.666 --> 11:48.850
Stephen Hawking hates me.

11:49.686 --> 11:51.219
I don't know what to do.

11:51.221 --> 11:52.504
I mean, the paper's terrible.

11:52.506 --> 11:54.723
But if I tell her,
she'll know that I read it

11:54.725 --> 11:56.074
and she'll get really mad.

11:56.076 --> 11:57.342
I was beating him so bad,

11:57.344 --> 11:59.344
he doesn't want
to be friends anymore.

11:59.346 --> 12:02.781
Why does everyone love me
except Stephen Hawking?

12:02.783 --> 12:06.018
Is it possible we're having
two different conversations?

12:06.020 --> 12:07.319
How would I know?

12:07.321 --> 12:09.321
I'm not listening to you.

12:10.189 --> 12:11.456
Hang on.

12:13.242 --> 12:14.242
Okay.

12:14.244 --> 12:15.410
Here's what we're gonna do.

12:15.412 --> 12:16.645
Chess clock.

12:16.647 --> 12:19.131
We each get five minutes
to talk about our problems.

12:19.133 --> 12:20.165
We'll take turns.

12:20.167 --> 12:21.583
Each turn will consist of

12:21.585 --> 12:24.469
a statement and a helpful
response from the friend.

12:24.471 --> 12:25.954
Begin.

12:25.956 --> 12:28.807
I humiliated Stephen Hawking

12:28.809 --> 12:30.208
in a game of Words with Friends.

12:30.210 --> 12:31.309
He stopped playing.

12:31.311 --> 12:32.794
And now we're not
friends anymore.

12:32.796 --> 12:34.763
He's probably busy.

12:34.765 --> 12:36.214
You're worried about nothing.

12:36.216 --> 12:37.799
Give it
a couple more days.

12:37.801 --> 12:39.401
I'm sure he'll play, and you'll
see that everything's fine.

12:39.403 --> 12:41.887
My turn.

12:41.889 --> 12:43.772
I can't let Penny
hand in a bad paper,

12:43.774 --> 12:45.407
but how do I tell her it's bad

12:45.409 --> 12:47.092
without letting her know
that I read it?

12:47.094 --> 12:48.443
Hmm.

12:48.445 --> 12:49.894
Beats me. Now...

12:51.697 --> 12:53.415
I know Hawking's not busy

12:53.417 --> 12:56.034
because I can see he's playing
other people right now.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.420
Maybe since you're so good,

12:58.422 --> 13:00.872
he's taking his time
to meet the challenge.

13:00.874 --> 13:02.207
I want Penny to enjoy school...

13:02.209 --> 13:04.376
Wolowitz told me
he's a big baby!

13:04.378 --> 13:05.861
But I didn't know that,

13:05.863 --> 13:08.079
and I played "extract"
for 82 points.

13:08.081 --> 13:10.465
It's all Amy's fault.
She told me to play it.

13:10.467 --> 13:12.901
I have got to cut her loose.

13:13.770 --> 13:16.388
Sheldon, I wasn't done talking.

13:16.390 --> 13:18.140
She hands in the paper tomorrow.

13:18.142 --> 13:19.808
I know I could help her.

13:19.810 --> 13:21.526
And she's my girlfriend...

13:21.528 --> 13:22.978
I-I should be
allowed to help her.

13:22.980 --> 13:24.496
Why aren't I allowed
to help her?

13:24.498 --> 13:26.598
Yeah, I hear you, brother.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.784
No.

13:28.786 --> 13:30.102
You need to give me some advice.

13:30.104 --> 13:32.003
Fine. Women, huh?

13:32.005 --> 13:33.688
No...

13:34.757 --> 13:37.692
Specific to my situation.

13:37.694 --> 13:39.094
Blonde women, huh?

13:41.531 --> 13:43.048
Empathetic!

13:43.050 --> 13:45.283
It sucks to be you.
I quit.

13:45.285 --> 13:47.536
Leonard, wait. No.

13:47.538 --> 13:50.806
I listened to your dumb thing.

13:50.808 --> 13:52.207
Leonard, come back.

13:52.209 --> 13:53.458
Leonard,
come back.

13:53.460 --> 13:54.493
Leonard, come back.

13:54.495 --> 13:55.977
What?
Oh, of course,

13:55.979 --> 13:58.396
it only works
on the weak-minded.

14:07.306 --> 14:10.075
(singsongy): Good morning,
sunshine.

14:10.927 --> 14:12.477
Leonard.

14:12.479 --> 14:14.145
It's 8:00 a.m.

14:14.147 --> 14:16.648
It's like the middle
of the night.

14:17.416 --> 14:19.501
I know, but I have
to go to work,

14:19.503 --> 14:21.453
and I made you
breakfast.

14:21.455 --> 14:23.371
Oh, wow,
that's so sweet.

14:23.373 --> 14:24.956
Hey, what's this?
Uh,

14:24.958 --> 14:27.008
before you open that, um,
are you familiar

14:27.010 --> 14:29.678
with the story of
"The Shoemaker and the Elves"?

14:29.680 --> 14:30.995
Elves? Come on, Leonard.

14:30.997 --> 14:33.765
- It's too early for <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>
- No, no.

14:37.053 --> 14:38.270
Listen, um...

14:38.272 --> 14:40.171
Once upon a time,
there was this shoemaker

14:40.173 --> 14:42.023
and when he went
to bed at night,

14:42.025 --> 14:43.358
elves would sneak in

14:43.360 --> 14:45.677
and they would make
all these amazing

14:45.679 --> 14:46.811
shoes for him.

14:46.813 --> 14:48.530
And when the shoemaker
woke up in the morning,

14:48.532 --> 14:50.699
he-he would be super happy,

14:50.701 --> 14:53.785
not mad at the elves <i>at all.</i>

14:54.620 --> 14:56.388
Open it.

14:56.390 --> 14:58.540
Okay.
(clears throat)

14:58.542 --> 15:01.243
"An examination
of the economic, cultural,

15:01.245 --> 15:03.411
and political roots of slavery

15:03.413 --> 15:06.998
in the Old South:
1619 to 1865."

15:07.817 --> 15:10.302
What the hell is this?

15:10.304 --> 15:13.471
Don't ask me.
A little elf did it.

15:15.308 --> 15:17.092
So let me get this straight.

15:17.094 --> 15:19.594
You just assumed my paper
would be bad

15:19.596 --> 15:21.296
so you wrote one for me?

15:21.298 --> 15:22.914
No, I assumed it would be good.
Then I read it.

15:22.916 --> 15:24.633
What?!
No, I...

15:24.635 --> 15:26.651
I mean, it was good.

15:26.653 --> 15:29.354
There were just a few things
that needed a little polishing.

15:29.356 --> 15:32.157
W... You changed every word.
That's not true.

15:32.159 --> 15:33.224
Uh...

15:33.226 --> 15:34.492
"Slavery."

15:36.746 --> 15:38.863
"1619,"

15:38.865 --> 15:41.666
your name at the top--
that's all you.

15:42.501 --> 15:44.319
You are such an ass.

15:44.321 --> 15:45.737
This is exactly why
I didn't want to tell you

15:45.739 --> 15:47.572
I was taking a class
in the first place.

15:47.574 --> 15:49.257
Please don't be upset.
I-I just...

15:49.259 --> 15:51.543
I didn't want you ending up
with a bad grade

15:51.545 --> 15:53.578
and get discouraged
and give up on the idea

15:53.580 --> 15:54.679
of going back to school.

15:54.681 --> 15:56.881
Right, because me
being in school

15:56.883 --> 15:58.300
is so important to you.

15:58.302 --> 16:00.568
That way, you wouldn't have
to be dating someone

16:00.570 --> 16:01.886
who's only a waitress.

16:01.888 --> 16:03.588
Oh, come on, you know
that's not true.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.089
Do I? Listen to me.

16:05.091 --> 16:06.725
I need to do this on my own.

16:06.727 --> 16:08.926
If I fail, I fail.
If I pass, I pass.

16:08.928 --> 16:09.927
Do you get it?

16:09.929 --> 16:11.396
I'm sorry.
I was just trying

16:11.398 --> 16:13.615
to help.
Yeah, well, next time don't.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.584
Oh, and since
you like stories so much,

16:16.586 --> 16:18.303
this is not "The Shoemaker
and the Elves," okay?

16:18.305 --> 16:20.872
This is, "Give a man a fish,
he eats it.

16:20.874 --> 16:22.290
"Teach a man to fish, he...

16:22.292 --> 16:24.108
sells it or something."
Whatever, I don't know!

16:24.110 --> 16:26.261
It's just a lot better
than what you did, you big jerk!

16:27.697 --> 16:29.831
(door slams)

16:32.285 --> 16:34.869
You ever hear back
from Hawking?

16:34.871 --> 16:36.554
No.

16:36.556 --> 16:38.807
It would appear
as if I've lost him.

16:38.809 --> 16:40.792
Stupid brain.

16:42.628 --> 16:43.762
It'll be okay.

16:43.764 --> 16:45.814
How can it be okay?

16:45.816 --> 16:47.365
Stephen Hawking's a genius

16:47.367 --> 16:49.317
and he talks like a robot.

16:49.319 --> 16:52.470
It's everything I've ever wanted
in a friend.

16:53.272 --> 16:54.773
Yeah, but if he's
a sore loser,

16:54.775 --> 16:56.274
maybe you're better
off without him.

16:57.109 --> 16:58.660
You're right.

16:58.662 --> 17:01.813
I guess I just have to make
lemonade out of the two of you.

17:04.817 --> 17:05.784
(chime)

17:05.786 --> 17:07.752
(gasps) He played!
He played!

17:07.753 --> 17:11.455
Coop and Rolling Thunder
are together again.

17:12.273 --> 17:15.159
He was okay with that nickname.

17:15.161 --> 17:17.359
So, now all you have to do
is let him win.

17:17.385 --> 17:19.346
Yeah,
way ahead of you.

17:19.348 --> 17:21.715
I will play the word "at"

17:21.718 --> 17:24.618
for two measly points,
throwing the game

17:24.621 --> 17:26.137
and thus securing my friendship

17:26.138 --> 17:28.390
with the smartest man
in the world.

17:35.798 --> 17:37.849
What are you waiting for?
Hit "send."

17:37.851 --> 17:39.016
I can't.

17:39.018 --> 17:41.569
Losing on purpose
is intellectually dishonest.

17:41.571 --> 17:42.871
So don't do it.

17:42.873 --> 17:44.689
Oh, but I want
to be Hawking's friend.

17:44.691 --> 17:45.940
So do it.

17:45.942 --> 17:47.876
No, but if I do,
I'll be a phony,

17:47.878 --> 17:49.026
a sellout,

17:49.028 --> 17:51.329
a Hollywood poser.

17:52.164 --> 17:53.982
Then don't do it.

17:53.984 --> 17:55.617
I won't.

17:55.619 --> 17:57.052
This feels right.

17:57.054 --> 18:00.255
My mother always said,
"To thine own self be true."

18:00.257 --> 18:01.589
Good for you.

18:01.591 --> 18:03.258
'Course she also told me
that every animal in the world

18:03.260 --> 18:05.977
got on one boat, so what does
she know? And send.

18:12.318 --> 18:13.401
Oh, hey.

18:13.403 --> 18:14.819
Haven't heard from you
in a couple days.

18:14.821 --> 18:15.804
You still mad at me?

18:15.806 --> 18:17.054
Nope.

18:17.056 --> 18:19.074
I have no reason to...

18:19.076 --> 18:20.992
"B" mad at you.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.145
Minus.

18:24.147 --> 18:25.530
(chuckles)

18:25.532 --> 18:26.448
Wow.

18:26.450 --> 18:28.232
That's right.
On my paper.

18:28.234 --> 18:31.219
Not yours, mine,
you punk-ass elf.

18:32.988 --> 18:34.923
I don't know what to say.

18:34.925 --> 18:36.291
Hmm, how about,

18:36.293 --> 18:38.910
(mockingly): "Gee, Penny, you're smarter
than I thought.

18:38.912 --> 18:40.762
"You may be the one in school,

18:40.764 --> 18:42.881
"but I'm the one
who learned a lesson.

18:42.883 --> 18:46.918
I'm so stupid, Penny.
Duh..."

18:51.807 --> 18:54.926
She sounds exactly like you!

18:56.762 --> 18:58.780
How'd it go
with Leonard?

18:58.782 --> 19:02.033
(sighs) I don't think he'll be making
that mistake again.

19:02.035 --> 19:03.034
Good.

19:03.036 --> 19:04.035
So,

19:04.037 --> 19:05.102
I know this goes
without saying,

19:05.104 --> 19:06.371
but if either of you
tell Leonard

19:06.373 --> 19:07.605
you helped me rewrite
this paper,

19:07.607 --> 19:10.325
I will beat you both
with a bag of oranges.

19:11.143 --> 19:12.444
Got it.
Understood.

19:12.446 --> 19:15.130
Now, ladies, we got a
B-minus on this paper.

19:15.132 --> 19:16.831
I think if we put
our heads together,

19:16.833 --> 19:19.200
on the next one
we could get an "A."

19:19.202 --> 19:22.187
Uh, but we got you a B-minus on
purpose to make it believable.

19:22.189 --> 19:23.588
Believable?

19:24.540 --> 19:25.840
You saying I'm not smart?

19:25.842 --> 19:28.359
No, no!
You're smart.

19:29.178 --> 19:30.929
That's better.

19:32.314 --> 19:34.799
(quietly): I feel like I'm in
high school again.

19:34.801 --> 19:39.154
Yeah, doing the prom queen's
homework so she'll like us.

19:39.156 --> 19:41.138
I know.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.324
It's finally working.

19:51.641 --> 19:53.859
(phone rings)

19:57.063 --> 19:58.530
It's Stephen Hawking.

19:58.532 --> 20:00.399
(stutters)
Answer it.

20:00.401 --> 20:02.584
I want to hear.

20:03.586 --> 20:04.987
Professor Hawking,

20:04.989 --> 20:06.472
how nice of you to call.

20:06.474 --> 20:07.706
Hello.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.626
I really enjoyed our game,
Dr. Cooper.

20:10.628 --> 20:11.627
Oh,

20:11.629 --> 20:13.512
me, too.

20:13.514 --> 20:17.182
Or should I say Dr. Loser?

20:19.552 --> 20:21.086
Ha, ha, ha.

20:22.588 --> 20:24.540
Yes,

20:24.542 --> 20:25.808
congratulations.

20:25.810 --> 20:27.726
You won fair and square.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.645
Uh, very impressive, sir.

20:29.647 --> 20:31.647
Do you like brain teasers?

20:31.649 --> 20:34.099
Oh, I love brain teasers.

20:34.611 --> 20:36.995
What does Sheldon Cooper

20:36.997 --> 20:40.665
and a black hole have in common?

20:40.667 --> 20:42.834
They both suck.

20:49.570 --> 20:51.422
Neener neener.

20:51.470 --> 20:56.470
