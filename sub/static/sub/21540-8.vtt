<i>Listing New York"...</i>

00:05.138 --> 00:08.942
I want to take it off and
revisit it at a later date.

00:08.975 --> 00:10.944
- Such an unbelievable
waste of my time.

00:10.977 --> 00:13.013
- We have a deal.
Congratulations.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.948
- Luis!
- Finally, huh?

00:14.981 --> 00:16.583
- It's not gonna happen, man.
- What?

00:16.616 --> 00:18.918
- We want to keep looking
on the Upper East Side.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.487
I apologize; I know how hard
you work on this.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.554
- No hard feelings.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.025
- That's, like, a woman in the
subway, and you can't even tell.

00:25.058 --> 00:26.426
- Yeah.

00:26.459 --> 00:29.062
- On some level, I know
this campaign is a little risky.

00:29.095 --> 00:31.531
You wanted someone
who was going to make a splash,

00:31.564 --> 00:33.133
<i>who was going</i>
<i>to do something different...</i>

00:38.371 --> 00:41.007
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:43.109
<i>- I'm the top dog</i>
<i>in real estate.</i>

00:43.143 --> 00:44.844
<i>I fetch deals all day long,</i>

00:44.878 --> 00:47.113
<i>but then I come home</i>
<i>for a treat.</i>

00:47.147 --> 00:49.582
<i>- The most important thing</i>
<i>to me is moving forward.</i>

00:49.616 --> 00:51.818
<i>I'm all about the journey,</i>
<i>not the trophy.</i>

00:51.851 --> 00:54.421
-<i>I've conquered New York,</i>
<i>but I'm not stopping there.</i>

00:54.454 --> 00:56.890
<i>No boundaries, no limits,</i>
<i>no problem.</i>

00:56.923 --> 00:58.658
I didn't steal your clients,
they came to me.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.460
- I worked really damn hard
to get here.

01:00.493 --> 01:02.629
I'm not gonna have
somebody like you steal from me.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.764
- You're not gonna disrespect me
ever again.

<i>* *</i>

01:14.474 --> 01:15.475
- What are we heading to?

01:15.508 --> 01:18.611
- We are going
to 1045 Park Avenue.

01:18.645 --> 01:21.514
<i>The Upper East Side is,</i>
<i>you know, old money,</i>

01:21.548 --> 01:24.751
<i>fur coats, high society.</i>

<i>When you think of</i>
<i>the Upper East Side,</i>

01:26.086 --> 01:27.921
<i>you think of</i>

<i>Carolina Herrera,</i>
<i>Salvatore Ferragamo,</i>

01:30.557 --> 01:32.325
<i>Coco Chanel.</i>

01:32.359 --> 01:33.727
<i>Oh, it's elegance.</i>

01:33.760 --> 01:35.729
Upper East Side is elegance.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.763
Hello!
- Hello.

01:36.796 --> 01:38.098
How are you?
- How are you?

01:38.131 --> 01:39.699
<i>Natasha Vardi</i>
<i>is the senior vice president</i>

01:39.733 --> 01:42.936
<i>for one of the biggest</i>

01:42.969 --> 01:44.270
- Welcome.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.206
<i>- And that man is</i>
<i>the owner of these apartments.</i>

01:46.239 --> 01:47.674
Well, how's life?
- Good.

01:47.707 --> 01:50.110
How's everything with you?
- Everything is amazing.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.478
You know,
I used to be afraid of you.

01:51.511 --> 01:52.679
- Really?
- Maybe I still am.

01:52.712 --> 01:54.214
- Maybe you still are.

01:54.247 --> 01:56.282
- But I used to be afraid
of you back in--when, in 2008?

01:56.316 --> 01:57.317
<i>When I was doing rentals,</i>

01:57.350 --> 01:59.686
my very first deal was with her.

01:59.719 --> 02:02.589
- Wow, man, those days, when
you were wearing your fedora...

02:02.622 --> 02:04.891
- Oh, no!
What was wrong with me?

02:04.924 --> 02:06.726
- You were known
as the fedora boy.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.462
<i>- Okay, I'm gonna confess that</i>
<i>when I started real estate,</i>

02:09.496 --> 02:12.332
I used to wear a suit
with long hair and a fedora

02:12.365 --> 02:14.901
<i>that I never ever, ever</i>
<i>took off.</i>

02:14.934 --> 02:16.236
- Yep, fedora boy.

02:16.269 --> 02:17.837
- [laughing]

02:17.871 --> 02:19.472
Okay.

02:19.506 --> 02:24.644
<i>* *</i>

02:24.678 --> 02:26.146
Wow, look at this.

02:26.179 --> 02:28.581
<i>1045 Park Avenue, it's</i>
<i>an amazing, amazing apartment.</i>

02:28.615 --> 02:31.718
Okay, it's a true Park Avenue
co-op penthouse apartment.

02:31.751 --> 02:32.919
This is about 50 feet.

02:32.952 --> 02:34.988
- It really lends itself
to entertaining.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.891
<i>- It's 5 bedrooms,</i>
<i>4 1/2 bedrooms,</i>

02:37.924 --> 02:39.459
<i>with windows all around.</i>

02:39.492 --> 02:40.560
You have views everywhere.

02:40.593 --> 02:42.295
You have a lot of sky,
which is great.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.297
I want this apartment
very much

02:44.330 --> 02:46.433
because it resembles
my personality.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.601
There's character to it.
- Mm-hmm.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.204
<i>- This apartment</i>
<i>is $10 million,</i>

02:51.237 --> 02:54.007
<i>which puts this listing at</i>
<i>about $2,500 per square foot.</i>

02:54.107 --> 02:55.742
It's priced a little high,

02:55.775 --> 02:57.977
<i>and the owners have been here</i>
<i>for 20 years</i>

02:58.011 --> 02:59.446
<i>so the kitchen</i>
<i>is a little bit dated</i>

02:59.479 --> 03:01.381
<i>and the bathrooms as well,</i>
<i>but other than that,</i>

03:01.414 --> 03:02.816
the place looks amazing.

03:02.849 --> 03:03.950
<i>I already know</i>
<i>exactly what to do.</i>

03:04.050 --> 03:05.285
I'm ready to start.

03:05.318 --> 03:09.322
- Hold up.
I don't just give listings away.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.458
- Natasha,
we--we have history, okay?

03:11.491 --> 03:14.094
- Luis, you got the phone call
because we're friends,

03:14.127 --> 03:17.630
but you have to prove to me
that you can sell this place.

03:17.664 --> 03:21.568
- I can already tell that
I have no advantage whatsoever

03:21.601 --> 03:23.903
over her deciding to bring me
on the listing.

03:23.937 --> 03:24.904
Understood.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.207
<i>I still need to prove to her</i>

03:27.240 --> 03:30.543
that I am the person
for this job.

03:30.577 --> 03:32.379
What is it that
you guys are looking for now?

03:32.412 --> 03:34.180
- You tell me
what you bring to the table.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.182
- You are very aware
of what I'm capable of doing.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.617
I proved that in 2008.

03:37.650 --> 03:41.554
- 2008 and 2016
are two different things.

03:41.588 --> 03:42.689
- Yes.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.890
So this is my strategy.

03:43.923 --> 03:45.492
This place has been on
the market before.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.093
But this apartment
has been marketed

03:47.093 --> 03:49.396
only to specific buyers,

03:49.429 --> 03:51.297
which are families
in the Upper East Side.

03:51.331 --> 03:52.866
I'm not gonna focus
only on families.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.367
I'm going to bring it
to everybody.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.403
- I really--
we don't have time to waste.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.271
We see this as a family home,
which it is.

03:58.304 --> 04:01.074
- Places like this
with this sort of layout

04:01.107 --> 04:02.642
would appeal to anybody.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.511
- And where
are you bringing them from?

04:04.544 --> 04:07.047
- Have you seen how big
my social media is?

04:07.047 --> 04:08.948
It's over a million people.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.817
All over the world.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.653
They're contacts that actually
listen to what I have to say.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.555
Listen, the world is changing.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.892
<i>Last year, I sold seven</i>
<i>apartments out of Instagram.</i>

04:18.925 --> 04:21.394
<i>And I'm talking about seven</i>
<i>pieces of very good business.</i>

04:21.428 --> 04:22.896
That is insane.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.332
No other broker
has that reach period.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.101
- I just need to make sure

04:28.134 --> 04:29.736
that you're gonna push
as hard as you can.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.172
- My relationship with you
means a lot to me.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.674
You guys were the first deal
I ever did

04:34.708 --> 04:36.443
when I started real estate
in 2008.

04:36.476 --> 04:39.312
Let's do this one together.

04:39.346 --> 04:40.980
- I like your wider lens.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.882
You know, you're well connected.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.619
Let's do it.
- Deal.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.822
Beautiful.
Come here.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.291
Amazing.
This is déjà vu all over again.

04:51.324 --> 04:53.493
<i>- Yep, fedora boy.</i>
<i>[both laughing]</i>

04:53.526 --> 04:54.761
<i>- Yes!</i>

04:57.430 --> 05:01.067
<i>* *</i>

05:01.101 --> 05:02.502
- I'm gonna have to get back to
you, like, in an hour or so.

05:02.535 --> 05:03.703
- Hey, there you are.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.772
I really need to talk to you.
- Just a minute.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.140
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

05:07.173 --> 05:09.042
My new building,
100 Avenue A,

05:09.042 --> 05:11.678
could not have started off
any worse.

05:11.711 --> 05:13.346
Ryan.
- Josh.

05:13.380 --> 05:16.149
<i>At first, I couldn't have been</i>
<i>happier to get the listing.</i>

05:16.182 --> 05:17.183
Let's do it.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.285
<i>It was a huge trophy project</i>

05:19.319 --> 05:21.087
<i>located in the East Village.</i>

05:21.121 --> 05:24.391
<i>It's 32 units.</i>
<i>It's a $65 million sellout.</i>

05:24.424 --> 05:27.427
I've never seen anything
like this in the East Village.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.729
<i>Because the building</i>
<i>won't be done with construction</i>

05:29.763 --> 05:31.498
<i>before I have to start selling,</i>

05:31.531 --> 05:33.900
<i>I had to go big on marketing.</i>

05:33.933 --> 05:35.802
[camera clicks]
<i>- I think we might be done.</i>

05:35.835 --> 05:37.804
- Holy sh**.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.139
- What's going on?

05:39.172 --> 05:41.675
- People are writing articles.
"This is sexist."

05:41.708 --> 05:43.777
Everyone's having
a f***ing heart attack.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.479
And now, my seller is pissed.

05:49.315 --> 05:50.383
And I mean, I have literally

05:50.417 --> 05:51.551
been on the phone
for three hours...

05:51.584 --> 05:53.086
[groaning]

05:53.086 --> 05:56.222
With my developer
since this morning.

05:56.256 --> 05:57.457
- Hey.
- Not right now.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.192
I need a moment.

05:59.225 --> 06:00.827
- Have you checked
your messages?

06:00.860 --> 06:02.762
- Why,
because people hate me

06:02.796 --> 06:05.365
and everyone thinks I'm
the worst marketer in the world?

06:05.398 --> 06:08.335
- Because the interest
for 100 Avenue A is insane.

06:08.368 --> 06:12.038
People have been calling,
emailing--it's insane.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.108
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:18.411 --> 06:22.782
- Oh, my God.

06:22.816 --> 06:26.386
I have, like, 700 emails
from the website right now.

06:26.419 --> 06:29.656
I mean, the last time
I got 700 emails...

06:29.689 --> 06:30.757
was never.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.826
[laughing]

06:32.859 --> 06:34.394
Jordan--no, never mind,
I don't need you.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.329
I'm gonna be--I'm gonna be
happier by myself.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.831
If you are gonna be successful,

06:37.864 --> 06:39.499
if you are going
to break boundaries,

06:39.532 --> 06:42.235
<i>you have to take things</i>
<i>to the Nth degree,</i>

06:42.268 --> 06:43.703
and now I know that.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.374
I just wanted to call and let
you know that you were right.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.076
Everything is okay.
[email tone dinging]

06:53.079 --> 06:54.647
- I love you, Puffer.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.551
[email tone dinging]

06:58.585 --> 07:00.220

<i>11 North Moore in Tribeca</i>
<i>was one of my biggest listings</i>

<i>of my entire career.</i>

07:20.940 --> 07:22.609
Zach!
- Hey there.

07:22.642 --> 07:23.943
- Give me a hug.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.078
Zach is one of
my most important clients

07:25.111 --> 07:26.813
and also a really dear
friend of mine.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.648
Whoo!
[bell dinging]

07:28.682 --> 07:30.950
<i>I sold 18</i>
<i>out of the 19 apartments</i>

07:31.051 --> 07:32.252
<i>for record-breaking prices.</i>

<i>I'm really proud of myself.</i>

07:33.653 --> 07:35.755
Guys, 100 million.

07:35.789 --> 07:39.225
But the last one,
the 19th unit, the penthouse,

07:39.259 --> 07:40.627
<i>it's been tricky.</i>

07:40.660 --> 07:42.128
<i>I've been showing it</i>
<i>to hundreds of people.</i>

07:42.162 --> 07:43.430
Zach?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.798
<i>But in my defense,</i>
<i>it wasn't finished.</i>

07:44.831 --> 07:46.232
<i>The penthouse</i>
<i>always is the last one</i>

07:46.266 --> 07:47.967
<i>because it's so much larger.</i>

07:48.068 --> 07:49.336
Zach?

07:49.369 --> 07:51.571
<i>It was a construction site</i>
<i>until just recently.</i>

07:51.604 --> 07:54.374
But thankfully,
the apartment is done

07:54.407 --> 07:55.809
and it looks amazing.

07:59.112 --> 08:02.015
I mean, this is a master
of the universe apartment.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.217
<i>I don't say that lightly;</i>
<i>I sell a lot of apartments.</i>

08:04.250 --> 08:07.187
<i>This one, 7,200 square feet</i>
<i>on the inside,</i>

08:07.220 --> 08:10.724
<i>3,500 square feet terraces--</i>
<i>four terraces.</i>

08:10.757 --> 08:13.259
<i>5 bedrooms,</i>
<i>5 1/2 baths.</i>

08:13.293 --> 08:14.260
$30 million.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.929
<i>I mean, this place is insane.</i>

08:16.029 --> 08:18.198
<i>It's not completely finished</i>
<i>and it's not staged yet,</i>

08:18.231 --> 08:20.867
<i>but for the very first time,</i>

08:20.900 --> 08:22.635
and this is big for me,

08:22.669 --> 08:26.072
it's starting to look
like a $30 million penthouse.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.107
Zach?

08:28.441 --> 08:30.043
Oh.
Hi!

08:30.076 --> 08:31.578
I'm here to see Zach.

08:31.611 --> 08:34.247
- You're not gonna see Zach.
You're seeing me.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.715
- Okay.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.051
- Steve and I crossed paths
a few times.

08:38.084 --> 08:39.786
I mean, I've been selling
the whole building for him

08:39.819 --> 08:42.255
as an investor,
so I know who he is,

08:42.288 --> 08:45.091
<i>but I deal only with Zach;</i>
<i>he's my contact person.</i>

08:45.125 --> 08:47.427
- We want this place sold.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.829
- You mean this product
that's, like, 90% sold.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.564
- This project.
- All the units--

08:51.598 --> 08:53.199
- But it's not.
But this is not sold.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.335
- No, the penthouse is left.
You know, it's usually--

08:55.368 --> 08:56.770
- You've had it for two years.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.304
- Whoa,
you're coming off strong here.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.240
- Two years,
time has come.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.242
- Listen, wait.
Can I say something?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.610
With all due respect,

09:03.643 --> 09:05.045
I've sold the whole building
with the exception of this

09:05.078 --> 09:06.246
because you weren't finished.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.148
I don't see furniture.
I asked for staging.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.216
It's not finished.
It's finally almost finished.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.918
<i>But it's dirt everywhere.</i>
<i>It's not staged.</i>

09:12.018 --> 09:14.487
<i>I mean, $30 million buyers</i>

09:14.521 --> 09:16.156
need to see
a finished environment.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.424
- This is New York City.

09:17.457 --> 09:21.027
We sell projects here that
are 500 million, 200 million--

09:21.061 --> 09:23.229
- No, the record is 105--

09:23.263 --> 09:25.398
- 105--and what
are we selling this for?

09:25.432 --> 09:27.500
- 29,995.
- That's a bargain.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.135
- Downtown, which is a record.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.404
When we lost a penthouse
two years ago,

09:31.438 --> 09:33.173
it was at $40 million.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.343
<i>It was like that pie in the sky</i>
<i>mentality back then.</i>

09:36.376 --> 09:37.711
There wasn't as many penthouses.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.779
They sold first usually
in every building.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.481
<i>And now,</i>
<i>when it's finally finished,</i>

09:41.514 --> 09:44.651
<i>inventory on these penthouses</i>
<i>is oversaturated.</i>

09:44.684 --> 09:48.188
So it's not gonna be easy to
find even a $30 million buyer

09:48.221 --> 09:50.056
and Steve needs
to understand that.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.592
For the first time even, like,
basically today,

09:52.625 --> 09:54.260
people can understand it.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.662
- I'm only gonna
tell you this once.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.565
We want it sold.
We want it sold tomorrow.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.138
- Where are you going?
- I have to go to LA.

10:05.171 --> 10:07.407
- Do you remember what we were
supposed to do this weekend?

10:18.184 --> 10:19.019
- Listen, I'm only
gonna tell you this once.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.189
We want it sold.
We want it sold tomorrow.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.491
- What you mean?
- I don't care what--

10:24.524 --> 10:26.126
- Is that, like--
is that a threat?

10:26.159 --> 10:28.728
What do you mean?
- Maybe.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.163
We're not waiting any longer.
That's it.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.998
It's either, you get it sold--

10:32.032 --> 10:35.101
- Let me remind you, I've shown
this place for two years.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.903
I've shown it to everyone,
but it wasn't finished.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.872
There was no glass, there was
no walls, there was no floors.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.674
Now, I see still paint buckets.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.776
It's like, this is what
I'm talking about.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.612
I mean, I have cabinetry, but--
I mean, come on.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.147
$30 million?

10:47.180 --> 10:48.381
We need to do this right.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.016
I'm gonna order
a cleaning service.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.584
But I need staging.
I need furniture.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.019
I've told you this
so many times.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.388
I want, like a big, big name,
like a Calvin Klein.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.823
It needs to be high-end.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.291
$30 million buyers,
billionaires--

10:58.324 --> 10:59.693
they want to see it finished.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.261
Now, you're gonna listen to me
and give me staging.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.096

we'll do.

11:03.129 --> 11:05.298

Let's get it down ASAP.

You screaming at me--

11:11.071 --> 11:12.972
- I don't want to hear it
anymore--sell the project.

why I was set up like this.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.848

Why did he send this investor?

- Yes.

11:52.779 --> 11:53.913
- Facebook?
- Yes.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.116

an amazing photographer

11:57.450 --> 12:00.220
to make it look even more

12:10.663 --> 12:12.532

12:15.068 --> 12:16.836
I need you to work late tonight.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.105

It's my sister's birthday.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.440
And I'm gonna meet her.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.909

12:22.942 --> 12:24.711

- Is she smart?

12:24.744 --> 12:25.912

- She's not for you.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.654

12:34.688 --> 12:37.457
This year, I'm very serious
about dating.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.994
So I will consider any option
that's on the table.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.463
- She's 22.
She's too young.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.597
- Listen...

12:44.631 --> 12:45.999
- You don't want to date
somebody in college.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.535
- Oh, yes, if I want to get five
babies, I want her to be young

12:48.568 --> 12:49.869

babies, she's still 29--boom.

No, you can't meet my sister.

in the building also for sale?

13:03.316 --> 13:04.718
- Yeah, the eighth floor
is on the market for sale

13:04.751 --> 13:06.653
and it's been on the market
for sale for 122 weeks.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.188
It's been there
for a long, long time,

13:08.221 --> 13:09.756
but we had to take
a very different approach--

13:09.789 --> 13:11.825
- Did you know
that it's in contract?

13:11.858 --> 13:13.059
- No, it's not in contract.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.627
- It's in contract.

13:17.263 --> 13:18.732
Updated today.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.067
- Oh, sh**.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.069
It is in contract.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.071
- It must have just happened.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.410
What are you thinking?

13:31.711 --> 13:34.614
- We have,
on the 15th floor,

13:34.647 --> 13:37.584
an apartment at $10 million.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.085
This apartment
on the eighth floor

13:39.085 --> 13:41.121

at $10,750,000.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.455

13:42.489 --> 13:44.391
- Yeah, fully renovated.
- Ours is a little dated.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.993
- Yeah, but it's--
it's a much better product.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.561
- We have better views.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.430
- They're going to be so pissed
if we go on the market

13:50.463 --> 13:53.700
and they see that this apartment
was available for them,

13:53.733 --> 13:55.702
but they don't
have to be pissed.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.704

the contract.

an apartment on the eighth floor

We're not doing anything wrong

with me?

16:54.180 --> 16:59.119
You're gonna help me
launch 100 Avenue A.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.554
And we can talk about
the wedding.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.223
We can pick a place
to get married.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.760
Oh, my God--we could do
a "pro" and "con" list.

17:06.793 --> 17:10.030
You love those!
And I also love them.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.032
- [laughing]
You're full of sh**.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.933
- I'm not!

17:14.034 --> 17:16.036
- But I bet I can sell
better than you.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.804
- Good.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.039
Let's do it.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.573
LA, here we come!

17:20.607 --> 17:22.242
It's like
the greatest time ever.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.577
- [laughing]
Aww, Puffles.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.179
You don't even know how to pack.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.380
I'll pack for you.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.716
- This is gonna be great.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.785
Except for the whole LA thing.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.086
- Why didn't he--

17:33.119 --> 17:35.355
what--what--
where's this buddy going?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.057
- All my underwear is
ridiculous colors.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.358
- [laughing]

17:41.461 --> 17:43.697
- I'm gonna look bad
with the seller's broker.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.099
I mean, it does open up
a can of worms.

17:46.132 --> 17:48.535
- I need to keep business
separate from friendship.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.070
That apartment
needs to get sold.

17:59.646 --> 18:00.146
<i>- Where's Kate Bosworth?</i>

18:01.514 --> 18:03.083
<i>Doesn't she live over here?</i>

18:03.116 --> 18:06.252
Ah, Los Angeles.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.355
<i>The sun, the ocean...</i>

18:08.388 --> 18:10.390
<i>driving in a convertible.</i>

18:10.423 --> 18:12.926
I really miss New York.

18:14.527 --> 18:15.729
Surfers.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.097
[cell phone chimes]

18:19.833 --> 18:21.801
[car horn honks]
Whoops.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.504
<i>My priority right now</i>
<i>is 100 Avenue A.</i>

18:24.537 --> 18:27.140
<i>But while I'm out here,</i>
<i>my team is also launching</i>

18:27.173 --> 18:29.776
<i>the biggest project</i>
<i>we've ever done in LA.</i>

18:29.809 --> 18:31.778
<i>This trip gives me</i>
<i>the opportunity</i>

18:31.811 --> 18:34.681
to make sure
that everything is perfect.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.216
- You've made it!

18:36.249 --> 18:38.084
- What's up, dude?
- How was the flight?

18:38.118 --> 18:39.652
- Amazing.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.055
- Welcome to 201.
- This place is beautiful.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.523
- Can't really find this
in New York.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.458
- No, no, no--there's way too
many people in yoga pants.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.060
- [laughing]

18:48.928 --> 18:52.065
<i>- 201 Ocean</i>
<i>is the biggest conversion</i>

18:52.098 --> 18:54.234
<i>to ever hit Santa Monica,</i>

18:54.267 --> 18:56.069
and possible Los Angeles
as a whole.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.105
Whoa.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.107
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

19:01.141 --> 19:04.244
Oh...my...

19:04.277 --> 19:05.445

19:05.478 --> 19:07.447
- This is literally
the crown jewel...

19:07.480 --> 19:10.917
- Holy sh**!
- Of the Ocean Towers.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.318
- This is crazy.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.822
<i>* *</i>

19:15.855 --> 19:18.024
This is a big living room.

19:18.058 --> 19:20.060
<i>* *</i>

19:20.093 --> 19:22.562
<i>When I think of Santa Monica,</i>

19:22.595 --> 19:26.099
<i>I think of light and bright and</i>
<i>beautiful and open.</i>

19:26.132 --> 19:28.134
<i>- We are</i>
<i>the tallest residential tower</i>

19:28.168 --> 19:29.569
<i>in Santa Monica.</i>

19:29.602 --> 19:31.037
<i>You have views forever.</i>

19:31.037 --> 19:32.539
<i>- I sell $4 1/2 million</i>
<i>apartments</i>

19:32.572 --> 19:34.040
<i>that face brick walls</i>
<i>in New York.</i>

19:34.040 --> 19:37.310
$4 1/2 million gets you
a lot more in Santa Monica.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.778
That is for sure.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.182
The master bath is green.

19:42.215 --> 19:44.484
Look at the lighting everywhere.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.885
Although, I don't understand

19:45.919 --> 19:48.088
why I have to go to the bathroom
in the back of a limousine,

19:48.121 --> 19:50.123
but this is LA.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.058
Now let's sell
the hell out of it.

19:52.092 --> 19:53.360
- We have to.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.529
- My team and I are
trying to hit $2,500 per foot,

19:56.563 --> 19:58.698
<i>which is unheard of</i>
<i>in Santa Monica.</i>

19:58.732 --> 20:00.400
All right, so let's get the rest
of the team up here

20:00.433 --> 20:01.668
and let's start going through
the details

20:01.701 --> 20:03.470
and then everyone can go back
to setting up

20:03.503 --> 20:04.871
so we can make sure
that tomorrow's

20:04.904 --> 20:06.339
the greatest day
in the history of the world.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.941
- Done.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.843
- Ah, yeah.
Yep.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.344
The old boomski.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.847
- Oh, look who it is!
- Hey, what's up, guys?

20:13.880 --> 20:17.617
It's not easy managing a team
that's 3,000 miles away,

20:17.650 --> 20:20.353
<i>which means I have to have</i>
<i>very capable people</i>

20:20.387 --> 20:22.422
working with me,
which I do.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.859
All right, so at the same time
we are launching 201 Ocean here,

20:25.892 --> 20:29.129
my team back in New York is
prepping to launch 100 Avenue A.

20:29.162 --> 20:31.564
I got all the renderings,
all the floor plans,

20:31.598 --> 20:32.966
so let's focus on

20:32.999 --> 20:35.035
selling the sh** out of
both these buildings tomorrow.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.302
[all murmuring agreement]

20:36.336 --> 20:38.405
All right, let's get food.
- I'm so hungry.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.873
- Are you allowed to eat
in Santa Monica?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.408
- You're not allowed, no.
- A lot of super skinny people--

20:41.441 --> 20:43.043
[laughter]

20:46.312 --> 20:54.487
<i>* *</i>

20:54.521 --> 20:55.822
- Hey, Fredrik.
- Hey, what's up?

20:55.855 --> 20:57.490
What are you doing here?
- It's so good to see you.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.926
- Is your dad home?
- Yeah, but it's kinda Friday.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.461
It's not a work day,
you know that?

21:01.494 --> 21:04.064
- Well, I mean, it's...
I'm always working.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.132
<i>I can't stop thinking of</i>
<i>what happened the other day.</i>

21:06.166 --> 21:08.101
<i>I was ambushed</i>
<i>at my own listing,</i>

21:08.134 --> 21:09.869
got all this pressure
for not selling something

21:09.903 --> 21:10.970
that wasn't even built.

21:11.071 --> 21:12.072
Good seeing you.

21:12.072 --> 21:13.506
<i>So Zach knows that I'm angry.</i>

21:13.540 --> 21:16.076
Send off Sebastian to open
the door--very clever, Zach.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.210
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

21:17.243 --> 21:18.278
Good to see you.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.246
But now, I want my answers.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.982
Zach, I mean, seriously....

21:23.083 --> 21:25.752
what was that?

21:27.087 --> 21:29.089
- That--
- I went to see you.

21:29.089 --> 21:32.692
I show up and it's like, this
energy's very dark and very--

21:32.726 --> 21:35.095
- Fredrik, we have an apartment
that needs to get sold.

21:35.095 --> 21:37.530
Sometimes I don't feel like
I actually come down on you.

21:37.564 --> 21:40.800
You know, our friendship kinda
keeps you very sheltered

21:40.834 --> 21:42.702
from the kind of pressure
I deal with from my investors.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.337
- Yeah, but our friendship
makes me more loyal.

21:44.371 --> 21:47.707
I work harder because I love you
and I want to make it work

21:47.741 --> 21:49.175
and I always try to--
- Fredrik.

21:49.209 --> 21:51.611
We're very loyal to you,
but I have to tell you,

21:51.644 --> 21:54.147
my investors constantly ask me

21:54.180 --> 21:57.484
if that loyalty
might be misplaced, right?

21:57.517 --> 21:59.586
- Well, let me answer you
and your investors.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.187
Now it's gonna be staged.

22:01.221 --> 22:03.189
I'm gonna throw
the biggest party ever.

22:03.223 --> 22:04.791
My attention is here.

22:04.824 --> 22:08.161
I just don't think I deserve
to be screamed at like that.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.662
And I wondered, like,
was that a setup, like--

22:09.696 --> 22:11.197
where--where are you
in all this?

22:11.231 --> 22:12.732
- I was gonna join Steve.

22:12.766 --> 22:13.800
Then I said, "You know what?

22:13.833 --> 22:16.903
Why don't I not be there
to buffer it?"

22:16.936 --> 22:19.606
I think you should
feel pressure.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.207
- I was kind of unsure,

22:21.241 --> 22:23.076
but now I understand it clearly.

22:23.076 --> 22:25.078
<i>Zach did this on purpose.</i>

22:25.078 --> 22:26.946
I don't think
that's what you do to friends.

22:26.980 --> 22:29.082
You don't set up your friends
like that.

22:29.082 --> 22:32.819
- I need to keep business
separate from friendship.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.454
That apartment
needs to get sold.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.623
People don't care
about our friendship.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.925
<i>- The fact that he actually</i>
<i>questions me</i>

22:38.958 --> 22:41.828
makes me quite upset
because, yes, we are friends.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.096
<i>You were at my wedding.</i>

22:43.096 --> 22:45.465
<i>He's a cornerstone</i>
<i>of my business.</i>

22:45.498 --> 22:48.134
Yet, now I'm like...

22:48.168 --> 22:49.569
where are we?

22:49.602 --> 22:52.639
It just feels like...
it's just, things are changing.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.775
- It's--it's the nature
of what we do.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.977
If this thing gets stale,

22:58.011 --> 23:00.046
I'm sure one of the remedies

23:00.080 --> 23:02.349
that my investors
will put in front of me

23:02.382 --> 23:04.451
would to change
a brokerage team.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.086
Right?

23:06.119 --> 23:07.587
- Let me go.
I gotta plan this party.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.723
I gotta stage this unit.
- All right.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.729
<i>* *</i>

23:15.762 --> 23:17.263
<i>- Today is the day</i>

23:17.297 --> 23:20.100
<i>that everything happens.</i>

23:20.133 --> 23:24.304
I'm still preparing an
open house for 1045 Park Avenue.

23:24.337 --> 23:26.973
But today, I'm doing something
that I have never done before.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.908
Joe, how you doing?

23:28.942 --> 23:30.577
- How are you?
- Good to meet you.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.512
So Joe is the broker
that represents the couple

23:32.545 --> 23:34.681
that just went into contract
downstairs.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.984
<i>But before they close</i>
<i>on the eighth floor,</i>

23:38.084 --> 23:40.086
I want them to back out
of that deal

23:40.086 --> 23:41.187
and buy mine.

23:41.221 --> 23:42.989
This is an amazing apartment,

23:43.089 --> 23:44.958
and I think timing
couldn't be better

23:44.991 --> 23:46.259
because they haven't closed yet,

23:46.292 --> 23:48.294
and I think that
now they have an opportunity

23:48.328 --> 23:51.631
to having the same apartment
on a much higher floor.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.770
- Luis, everything's done...

23:56.803 --> 23:58.505
You know, I mean...

23:58.538 --> 24:00.573
professionally,
it's hard for me.

24:00.607 --> 24:03.877
I'm gonna look bad
with the seller's brokers.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.212
- Yeah, we can worry about
all that afterwards.

24:06.246 --> 24:07.881
- [sighs]
You know...

24:07.914 --> 24:10.717
- He has a deal that
it's pretty much wrapped up.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.485
- It does open up
a can of worms.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.387
<i>- But at the same time,</i>
<i>the buyers,</i>

24:14.421 --> 24:17.123
they're going to regret not
having the top-floor apartment.

24:17.157 --> 24:20.627
So I am the savior here.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.495
Listen, can--let me show you
the apartment.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.730
- Okay.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.801
- The living room here,
it's 50 feet wide.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.070
It's double living room,
which is very special.

24:30.103 --> 24:31.504
You know,
it's the older moldings.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.373
- The molding--
the molding details are great.

24:33.406 --> 24:34.741
- Yes.
- I mean, downstairs...

24:34.774 --> 24:37.911
It's actually very contemporary.
- Mm-hmm.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.246
- I mean, this is--this is
beautiful with the moldings.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.115
- So this is the bathroom.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.850
- It needs some work.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.385
- Yes.

24:45.418 --> 24:47.987
- Look, I can see that
it's a beautiful apartment.

24:48.088 --> 24:51.224
<i>Being up here, it's brighter,</i>
<i>it's nice.</i>

24:51.257 --> 24:52.726
It needs a little work.
- Yes.

24:52.759 --> 24:54.594
- Bathrooms need a little work,
whereas, downstairs,

24:54.627 --> 24:56.996
everything is fully done up,
move-in condition.

24:57.097 --> 24:59.132
<i>- The bathrooms--being needed</i>
<i>to be renovated,</i>

24:59.165 --> 25:00.333
<i>it really is not an issue.</i>

25:00.367 --> 25:01.568
The reality is,

25:01.601 --> 25:03.603
that's not gonna cost
more than $300,000

25:03.636 --> 25:06.473
to make it look exactly like the
apartment on the eighth floor.

25:06.506 --> 25:07.774
<i>But the eighth floor</i>
<i>will never be worth</i>

25:07.807 --> 25:10.110
what the 15th floor is, ever

25:10.143 --> 25:12.379
You have this:
look at the view here.

25:12.412 --> 25:14.581
You can see all the tops
of all the Park Avenue co-ops,

25:14.614 --> 25:15.882
which are extremely beautiful.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.784
- Right--no, I understand.
I understand.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.319
We'll discuss it.

25:19.352 --> 25:23.056
But I'm worried about
the ramifications, you know?

25:23.089 --> 25:25.492
This could be very, very,
very complicated.

25:27.227 --> 25:28.828
- I got an email from your team

25:28.862 --> 25:31.064
about 100 Avenue A.

25:41.141 --> 25:41.908
- This could be very, very
complicated.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.611
- So, you know,
sit for a second.

25:44.644 --> 25:47.113
How can--let's talk about
how can we make this work.

25:47.147 --> 25:49.215
- Listen,
it's the political ramifications

25:49.249 --> 25:50.784
I'm really worried about.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.485
Truthfully.
Not just for myself.

25:52.519 --> 25:53.853
I mean, uh, you know.

25:53.887 --> 25:55.755
I'm worried about
the co-op board, frankly.

25:55.789 --> 25:59.859
- Nowhere in the country
do you have to deal with co-ops

25:59.893 --> 26:01.094
except in New York.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.029
<i>So a co-op is a cooperative.</i>

26:03.029 --> 26:05.498
Think about it as a company
with shareholders.

26:05.532 --> 26:07.334
People, when they buy
an apartment,

26:07.367 --> 26:08.802
<i>they're buying shares.</i>

26:08.835 --> 26:11.104
Now the co-op board can decide

26:11.137 --> 26:13.440
which person
gets in the building.

26:13.473 --> 26:15.442
- You know, the co-op board
might try and do something

26:15.475 --> 26:19.479
to reject my buyers, even though
we've already passed it once.

26:19.512 --> 26:21.548
- But why would they do that?
- You know how this works.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.083
It--it's a fiefdom.

26:23.116 --> 26:25.051
If we renege on this deal,

26:25.051 --> 26:27.887
it really is gonna open up
a can of worms.

26:27.921 --> 26:30.690
Do you realize that the seller
of the unit downstairs

26:30.724 --> 26:32.459
is on the board of the co-op,

26:32.492 --> 26:35.695
who can basically blackball us
from this building.

26:35.729 --> 26:37.530
The seller's brokers
can blackball us

26:37.564 --> 26:38.898
up and down Park Avenue.

26:38.932 --> 26:40.400
I mean, where are we gonna buy?

26:40.433 --> 26:41.735
- My client is also
on the board.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.436
And everybody knows
my seller here.

26:43.470 --> 26:46.973
- So your seller might have to
get involved in the politics.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.541
- Yes, 100%.
- Is he willing to--

26:48.575 --> 26:50.944
- I think it's worth a shot.
At least--

26:50.977 --> 26:52.679
- I'm worried.
- I understand that, but--

26:52.712 --> 26:54.981
- So assume we get the politics
sorted out.

26:55.081 --> 26:58.451
We have a 10% hard,
binding deposit

26:58.485 --> 27:00.553
on the downstairs unit.

27:04.024 --> 27:05.125
- F***.

27:05.158 --> 27:06.860
- $1 million.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.195
So if we back out of that,

27:09.229 --> 27:11.765
we're out $1 million--
the seller gets to keep it.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.668
- Doesn't matter
how much money you have.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.670
You don't want to take
$1 million

27:16.703 --> 27:18.271
and burn it.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.040
<i>Makes this very, very tough.</i>

27:20.040 --> 27:21.775
<i>Makes it tougher,</i>
<i>but I'm not gonna stop.</i>

27:21.808 --> 27:23.043
I'm not gonna stop,

27:23.043 --> 27:24.044
because I know it'll be worth it
in the end.

27:24.044 --> 27:26.279
In five years,
this would be worth

27:26.312 --> 27:28.148
much more than the eighth floor.

27:28.181 --> 27:30.517
- Sure, I can appreciate--
- Something to consider.

27:30.550 --> 27:31.951
- Right--no,
I can appreciate that.

27:32.052 --> 27:33.486
I can appreciate that.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.155
- But let's--if there's a deal
to be had, let's explore it.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.559
You know, go back
to your clients, talk to them.

27:39.592 --> 27:42.162
Let's--let's just see
if this is possible.

27:42.195 --> 27:43.730
- Okay.
- Good.

27:43.763 --> 27:45.298
- I'll try.
- Beautiful.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.533
- Thank you.

27:46.566 --> 27:48.201

<i>where I'm coming from.</i>

27:48.234 --> 27:50.070

that he's able to translate...

27:50.103 --> 27:51.571
- Thank you for coming.
- Bye-bye.

<i>to his buyers.</i>

28:05.118 --> 28:06.619

Good? Okay.

28:06.653 --> 28:09.222

28:09.255 --> 28:11.658

28:11.691 --> 28:13.560

Very good to meet you.

How we doing?
- Oh, hello.

28:23.636 --> 28:25.739
Thank you for coming.
- Oh, you look pretty.

<i>I haven't had any time to talk</i>

28:28.641 --> 28:30.310
I mean, she's giving me
a little leeway

28:30.343 --> 28:31.745
because I've been pretty busy.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.380
- So can we have a drink?
- Yeah.

28:33.413 --> 28:35.248

<i>to New York,</i>

28:35.281 --> 28:38.184
I'm gonna focus
on the wedding stuff.

28:38.218 --> 28:39.886
That's what I'm gonna do.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.187
* *

28:41.221 --> 28:43.623
318 units here,
and we're converting them,

28:43.656 --> 28:45.091
<i>slowly but surely.</i>

28:45.125 --> 28:46.526
So we're starting with 40 units,

28:46.559 --> 28:49.896
of which ten we just released.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.064
Come on in.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.932
Take a look at all
the beautiful renovations.

28:52.966 --> 28:55.068
Venetian plaster--

28:55.068 --> 28:57.637
Oh, turned
the whole kitchen green!

28:57.671 --> 29:00.807
It's almost 1,800 square feet.
Two bed, three bath.

29:00.840 --> 29:04.244
How could you not
not pay $4.7 million?

29:04.277 --> 29:06.613
Check out the balcony.
The balcony's totally crazy.

29:06.646 --> 29:08.548
You get the mountains, you
get the city, you get the ocean.

29:08.581 --> 29:11.017
The view here is incredible.
- Certainly.

29:11.017 --> 29:12.485
- Yeah.

29:12.519 --> 29:14.187
So where do you work?
- Bank of California.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.289
- And now,
do you do just California?

29:16.322 --> 29:18.058
- I do nationwide.
- Oh, cool.

29:18.091 --> 29:20.894
This party's for our project
in Santa Monica, obviously.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.196
We've got a project in the East
Village called 100 Avenue A.

29:23.229 --> 29:26.032
But I'm trying to see what
kind of industries they're in

29:26.066 --> 29:27.934
to see if maybe
they're bicoastal.

29:28.034 --> 29:30.203
32 units, one-bedrooms
and two-bedrooms.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.038
The whole thing's brand-new
construction; it's ground up.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.541
It's the old Hollywood Theater
right on Tompkins Square Park.

29:34.574 --> 29:36.643
These people have to be sick
of living here, right?

29:36.676 --> 29:38.345

I mean, that's gotta get old.

29:42.182 --> 29:43.283
Yeah.

29:43.316 --> 29:45.185
This is our marketing campaign.

29:46.353 --> 29:47.854
- We did.
- He did.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.389
- That's sexy.
- It really is.

29:49.422 --> 29:50.490
- That's a sexy
marketing campaign.

29:50.523 --> 29:52.192
- Do you think so?
- Oh, 100%.

29:52.225 --> 29:53.660
- Some other people
didn't think so.

29:53.693 --> 29:55.428
[laughter]
- I think so.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.432

Whoa, I have not been
to this one yet.

30:08.508 --> 30:10.577
So downstairs is great.
I was just down there.

30:10.610 --> 30:12.812
The response has been
pretty insane.

30:12.846 --> 30:14.881
- You know, there is one thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

30:14.914 --> 30:15.849
- Okay.

30:15.882 --> 30:16.950
- I got an email from your team

30:16.983 --> 30:20.186
about 100 Avenue A.

30:20.220 --> 30:22.856
<i>- Oh, God.</i>
<i>What did my team do?</i>

30:22.889 --> 30:24.457
<i>It's kind of a no-no</i>

30:24.491 --> 30:28.428
to send one developer
your other developer's project.

30:28.461 --> 30:31.097

diversifying to New York

30:31.131 --> 30:33.466

to do it with.

30:33.500 --> 30:34.501
I love the project.

30:34.534 --> 30:35.769
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:35.802 --> 30:37.570
- Obviously.
- [laughing]

30:37.604 --> 30:38.638
- All right,
I'll show you everything

30:38.672 --> 30:40.640
while we're downstairs.
- Fantastic.

30:40.674 --> 30:42.642
- Maybe I should send all
my developers all my projects.

30:42.676 --> 30:44.244
They're all just buying
in each other's.

30:44.277 --> 30:45.345
It'd be great.

30:45.378 --> 30:46.579

30:48.682 --> 30:50.283

34:51.157 --> 34:52.726
And I like that
you have private parking,

34:52.759 --> 34:54.160
'cause a lot of celebrities--

34:54.194 --> 34:56.129
you know, we had Leonardo
DiCaprio here looking at it,

34:56.162 --> 34:57.130
and he didn't buy it,
unfortunately,

34:57.163 --> 34:58.998
but he could come in
in a car,

34:59.099 --> 35:01.334
private elevator,
buzz, and you're home.

35:02.702 --> 35:03.703
Thank you.

35:06.039 --> 35:07.173
<i>What do you guys think</i>
<i>about the furniture?</i>

35:07.207 --> 35:08.441
It's gorgeous, right?

35:10.610 --> 35:11.644
Yes.

35:11.678 --> 35:13.246
So guys,

35:13.279 --> 35:15.348
$30 million.

35:15.382 --> 35:16.483
What do you guys think?

35:22.055 --> 35:24.691
I mean, I think
the price is low too.

35:24.724 --> 35:26.760
It--it makes me speechless too.

35:26.793 --> 35:28.428
Why are you so quiet?
- That's a lot.

35:28.461 --> 35:30.330
You don't feel it's overpriced?

35:30.363 --> 35:32.065
<i>- I mean, it's a record.</i>

35:32.098 --> 35:34.334
Every time you set a record,
you're gonna get resistance.

35:34.367 --> 35:36.202
People are gonna say
it's impossible.

35:36.236 --> 35:37.871
People are gonna say
it's overpriced.

35:39.406 --> 35:41.241
- Well, I mean, I'd prefer 35,
but you know,

35:41.274 --> 35:43.510
it is was it is--we'll meet
in the middle: 29.95.

35:43.543 --> 35:46.079
- Just seems like it's been
on the market for quite a while.

35:46.112 --> 35:47.614
I mean, are the developers
sort of...

35:47.647 --> 35:49.749
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter,
because that's the past

35:49.783 --> 35:51.918
and I live in the future, and in
the future, it's already sold.

35:51.951 --> 35:53.987
I think what we're waiting for
was it to be finished,

35:54.087 --> 35:55.221
and now I'm ready.

35:55.255 --> 35:56.956
I mean, I feel it--it's, like
vibrating the room.

35:56.990 --> 35:58.725
- I totally get your point
as far as that goes,

35:58.758 --> 36:00.627
but, you know, it's been on
for a while,

36:00.660 --> 36:02.662
and developers want to get
the money; move to the next.

36:02.696 --> 36:03.830
So when it sits
on the market like this

36:03.863 --> 36:05.365
for a long time, it's a problem.

36:05.398 --> 36:07.834
I mean, maybe it's time to pass
the buck, I don't know.

36:07.867 --> 36:09.102
- The time to what?

36:09.135 --> 36:11.571
- To pass the--
pass the torch a little bit.

36:13.540 --> 36:15.542
- Um...

36:15.575 --> 36:17.377
I don't really understand
where you're going with this.

36:17.410 --> 36:18.545
You're saying...

36:24.050 --> 36:26.853
- You come to my open house,
I understand.

36:26.886 --> 36:28.888
I mean, I've had people,
like, try to steal my business,

36:28.922 --> 36:31.624
<i>but in front of me,</i>
<i>at an open house in public?</i>

36:31.658 --> 36:32.892
Whoa.

36:32.926 --> 36:34.527
What did you do to your hand,
anyway?

36:34.561 --> 36:37.097
- Too many signed contracts,
actually.

36:38.932 --> 36:41.067
- Okay, I mean, you know what?

36:41.067 --> 36:42.769
If you want to prove to Zach,
you want to prove to the world

36:42.802 --> 36:44.671
that you can get this done,
why don't you bring a buyer?

36:44.704 --> 36:46.139
At least have a showing.

36:46.172 --> 36:48.341
There's nothing else
to be said.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.710
Real estate is like...

36:50.744 --> 36:53.646
a boxing game, but instead of,
like, you boxing with one,

36:53.680 --> 36:56.182
<i>you're boxing with, like,</i>
<i>five people, and you know what?</i>

36:56.216 --> 36:59.152
There's only one way to solve
all of these people.

36:59.185 --> 37:01.855
<i>And that's to sell</i>
<i>this penthouse.</i>

37:01.888 --> 37:03.023
- Hey, Zach?
Hey, what's up?

37:03.023 --> 37:04.691
I'm Nicholas Palance.

37:04.724 --> 37:06.593
- Who wants to live in these
huge, massive buildings

37:06.626 --> 37:08.762
with 500 units--
this is boutique.

37:08.795 --> 37:11.064
- Are you happy with
who you're with now?

37:11.097 --> 37:12.866
- It's been a long history.
- Good.

37:12.899 --> 37:14.901
Well, I'd love to talk to you
sometime regardless.

37:23.610 --> 37:25.578
- So one of my girlfriends
who lives in New Jersey

37:25.612 --> 37:27.947
saw your marketing campaign
and she's so interested,

37:28.048 --> 37:29.115
so I'm sending her your way.

37:29.149 --> 37:30.216
- Let's do it!
- Absolutely.

37:30.250 --> 37:31.885
- Let's do a deal.
- Absolutely.

37:31.918 --> 37:34.054
<i>- I got back from LA</i>
<i>six days ago</i>

37:34.087 --> 37:37.757
and now my entire focus is
100 Avenue A.

37:37.791 --> 37:40.160
So we have one-bedrooms
and two-bedrooms

37:40.193 --> 37:42.696
priced from basically
1.3 to, like, 2.6.

37:42.729 --> 37:44.064
There's a lot
of private outdoor space,

37:44.097 --> 37:45.365
there's an amazing roof deck.

37:45.398 --> 37:46.700
And then you're right
on the park.

37:46.733 --> 37:49.235
So follow me this way.
We'll go into the model.

37:49.269 --> 37:50.503
Beautiful marble countertops.

37:50.537 --> 37:52.072
You have the herringbone
backsplash.

37:52.072 --> 37:54.274
The building is, I think,
pretty underpriced

37:54.307 --> 37:55.809
for now, anyway.

37:55.842 --> 37:58.411
Between the interest that
I've gotten in my time in LA...

37:58.445 --> 37:59.512
So you want the sixth floor?

37:59.546 --> 38:00.680
<i>And in New York...</i>

38:00.714 --> 38:02.716
Full ask?
Awesome, so unit 2.

38:02.749 --> 38:04.317
Okay, perfect.

38:04.351 --> 38:08.621
I've already sold 14
out of 32 units.

38:08.655 --> 38:10.757
<i>[heavenly strings,</i>
<i>choir sings]</i>

38:14.427 --> 38:17.030
- Hey, Ryan!
- What's going on, guys?

38:17.063 --> 38:18.298
Welcome to New York!

38:18.331 --> 38:20.200
<i>In addition to 100 Avenue A,</i>

38:20.233 --> 38:23.136
<i>we've already sold one at Omar</i>
<i>and his father's property</i>

38:23.169 --> 38:25.839
<i>in Santa Monica at the highest</i>
<i>price per square foot</i>

38:25.872 --> 38:27.173
<i>ever recorded.</i>

38:27.207 --> 38:28.608
Like, by far.

38:28.641 --> 38:30.910
- 60% higher than any price
in Santa Monica ever sold.

38:30.944 --> 38:33.380
- Yeah, ever, ever.
- Ever.

38:33.413 --> 38:35.849
- It's one thing to sell
a property in another city...

38:35.882 --> 38:37.050
- Amazing job.

38:37.050 --> 38:38.418
<i>- It's a totally</i>
<i>different thing</i>

38:38.451 --> 38:41.287
<i>to put your stamp on that city.</i>

38:41.321 --> 38:42.889
I don't know, I can't
explain it; it's awesome.

38:42.922 --> 38:44.157
It is an amazing feeling.

38:44.190 --> 38:46.059
<i>So this is 100 Avenue A,</i>

38:46.059 --> 38:48.528
<i>and I talked to you about it</i>
<i>when we were in your building.</i>

38:48.561 --> 38:49.929
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- So what do you think?</i>

38:49.963 --> 38:51.931
- So what's the biggest
two-bedroom we can get?

38:51.965 --> 38:54.868
- The biggest two-bedroom
is gonna be the D-line

38:54.901 --> 38:57.370
facing east;
it has outdoor space,

38:57.404 --> 38:59.806
and that's 1,035 square feet.

38:59.839 --> 39:01.808
- That's not gonna be enough
for us.

39:01.841 --> 39:05.645
- Hmm...but that's the biggest
apartment we have.

39:05.679 --> 39:08.014
- That's not gonna be enough.

39:08.014 --> 39:09.449
<i>[dramatic tones]</i>

39:17.457 --> 39:18.191
is gonna be
the 1,035 square feet.

39:20.026 --> 39:21.761
- That's not gonna be enough
for us.

39:21.795 --> 39:26.266
- Hmm...but that's the biggest
apartment we have.

39:26.299 --> 39:29.135
But next to it,

39:29.169 --> 39:31.671
we have a one-bedroom,
E-line,

39:31.705 --> 39:34.808
which could make
a pretty awesome combination.

39:34.841 --> 39:36.810
<i>[dramatic tones]</i>

39:36.843 --> 39:39.946
- Something to really consider.

39:40.046 --> 39:42.315
<i>- I'm only two units away</i>
<i>from my 50% goal</i>

39:42.349 --> 39:44.484
that Josh, my seller,
set up for me.

39:44.517 --> 39:45.652
Before we launch or anything,

39:45.685 --> 39:47.053
you want me to sell
half this building?

39:47.087 --> 39:48.088
- It's very important.

39:48.121 --> 39:49.956
<i>- Maybe it's possible</i>

39:50.056 --> 39:52.859
for me to sell both of them
to one person.

39:52.892 --> 39:54.427
So the building is
beautiful red brick,

39:54.461 --> 39:56.463
black casement windows,
and then,

39:56.496 --> 39:57.764
these are your floors.

39:57.797 --> 39:59.232
So you have the herringbone
white oak

39:59.265 --> 40:01.701
throughout the living rooms,
the hallways, all the bedrooms.

40:01.735 --> 40:04.037
All the kitchens are being built
and imported from Italy

40:04.070 --> 40:05.438
by a company called Effeti.

40:05.472 --> 40:07.240
- Beautiful.
Very cheerful.

40:07.273 --> 40:09.342
Very cheerful.
- Cheerful.

40:09.376 --> 40:11.411
I want to use that.
[all laughing]

40:11.444 --> 40:12.979
<i>So let's leave this stuff here.</i>

40:13.013 --> 40:15.215
<i>We'll go over to the site.</i>

40:15.248 --> 40:18.518
And this is the roof,
with the coolest view ever.

40:18.551 --> 40:19.986
- The New York skyline is
really gorgeous.

40:20.020 --> 40:21.788
- I know.
It's amazing.

40:21.821 --> 40:24.290
This is the D and the E, which
is the three-bed combination

40:24.324 --> 40:25.859
that I think you're gonna like.

40:25.892 --> 40:28.528
And the total price for both
would be $3.8 million.

40:28.561 --> 40:30.864
<i>But just know that</i>
<i>the pricing that we have now</i>

40:30.897 --> 40:33.933
is the starting price,
so you jump in now,

40:33.967 --> 40:35.468
everyone else is gonna pay more.

40:35.502 --> 40:38.672
Omar and his dad can afford
the combination.

40:38.705 --> 40:40.340
<i>I'm in the process right now</i>

40:40.373 --> 40:42.208
of making them
millions of dollars

40:42.242 --> 40:43.977
<i>at 201 Ocean.</i>

40:44.010 --> 40:45.412
They can take
some of those millions

40:45.445 --> 40:46.813
and bring them back
to 100 Avenue A.

40:46.846 --> 40:48.715
It's bright, it's new,
it's cool.

40:48.748 --> 40:50.984
It's in an area that is
completely upcoming.

40:51.017 --> 40:52.352
And this would be--
I mean, this would be

40:52.385 --> 40:54.688
the one three-bedroom
in the building.

40:54.721 --> 40:56.656
And this would be awesome.

40:59.526 --> 41:03.296
- I can tell from the layout,
it would work perfectly.

41:03.329 --> 41:05.131
So...

41:05.165 --> 41:06.533
let's do it.

41:06.566 --> 41:08.668
- Yes! Yes!

41:08.702 --> 41:11.171
Whoa, my God, I did it!
We're 50% sold!

41:11.204 --> 41:13.139
- I love it.
- We do the best of the best.

41:13.173 --> 41:15.175
And that's why I think
this place is really special.

41:15.208 --> 41:16.743
- Yeah.

41:16.776 --> 41:18.111
<i>That's 16 apartments</i>
<i>before we officially launch,</i>

41:18.144 --> 41:20.547
which means I am...
wow, awesome.

41:20.580 --> 41:22.849
Basically, I am awesome.

41:22.882 --> 41:23.950
And I'm okay admitting that.

41:23.983 --> 41:26.252
I love you.
[laughter]

41:26.286 --> 41:27.520
Also, just for the record,

41:27.554 --> 41:29.856
New York,
still better than LA.

41:34.994 --> 41:37.597
- So you collected all those
business cards at the event.

41:37.630 --> 41:38.598
- Mm-hmm.
- What about the ad?

41:38.631 --> 41:39.966
"New York Post."

41:40.000 --> 41:42.736
Second page for 11 North Moore
penthouse on Saturday.

41:42.769 --> 41:44.170
It's gonna be expensive.

41:44.204 --> 41:45.271
- It's worth it; we'll sell it.
[cell phone ringing]

41:45.305 --> 41:48.274
- So maybe we can take some--
[gasps]

41:48.308 --> 41:51.144
Steve, the investor.

41:51.177 --> 41:52.312
<i>Fredrik speaking.</i>

41:54.748 --> 41:56.483
- This is Fredrik.
How are you?

41:56.516 --> 41:58.818
I-I didn't see you at the event
I did at 11 North Moore.

42:02.288 --> 42:05.592
- The party was, you know,
27 hours ago.

42:05.625 --> 42:07.794
I mean, I'm working on it.

42:11.131 --> 42:12.665
- But the thing is,
in this market,

42:12.699 --> 42:14.234
$30 million, it doesn't--
it's just not--

42:14.267 --> 42:16.469
It's not like it's flying
off the shelf, you know.

42:16.503 --> 42:17.570
Let me do my thing.

42:22.075 --> 42:23.243
- Wait--excuse me?

42:23.276 --> 42:24.511
What are you saying to me
right now?

42:28.882 --> 42:30.116
- I can't believe this!

42:34.954 --> 42:37.457
<i>- Next on "Million Dollar</i>
<i>Listing New York"...</i>

42:37.490 --> 42:39.092

42:39.092 --> 42:40.827
- TV's actually
on a motorized stand.

42:40.860 --> 42:43.697
- I've never seen apartments
that are this tricked out.

42:43.730 --> 42:45.398

of excuses.

42:45.432 --> 42:46.700

42:46.733 --> 42:48.902
- Time is money
and you're wasting my time.

42:48.935 --> 42:51.104
- I'm not gonna have somebody
like, "You steal from me."

42:51.137 --> 42:53.773
- You think that I'm the only
one going after your clients?

42:53.807 --> 42:55.709
- Eklund out.
Serhant in.

42:55.742 --> 42:57.143
You just make sure you blast
that out to everyone we know

42:57.177 --> 42:58.745
