02:11.999 --> 02:13.033
I love this movie.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.203
They-they shot this
on Staten Island.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.271
(alarm bell continues over TV)

02:17.405 --> 02:18.872
-(gunshot)
-Whew! -Oh!

02:19.006 --> 02:20.174
-Oh!
-Ooh, God!

02:20.308 --> 02:21.175
-Awesome.
-Hell yeah.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.510
-Ew!
-(groans)

02:22.643 --> 02:23.777
OSCAR:
That's my shit.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.413
This movie makes no sense.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.416
Why-why would the government
make a purge legal?

02:28.549 --> 02:31.919
-Clearly to let them blow off
some steam. Hello. -Yeah.

02:32.052 --> 02:35.122
-That's why you go to the spa.
-Yeah. Or the therapist.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.225
-Or get your nails done.
-SCOTT: Or...

02:37.358 --> 02:39.360
Or murder some folks. Hmm?

02:39.493 --> 02:41.229
I mean, come on, guys.
I-I brought Tara over

02:41.362 --> 02:43.096
so that we could
get out of this basement.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.598
Let's go out.
Let's go dancing.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.734
-I love dancing.
-Let's do something.

02:46.867 --> 02:47.968
We don't go out.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.437
We don't dance.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.239
-The Purge is not enough
for you? -KELSEY: No.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.240
Does anybody else like dancing?

02:52.373 --> 02:53.307
-I like it.
-TARA: Yes, me!

02:53.441 --> 02:54.308
-You do?
-I love dancing.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.543
Yes.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.944
He loves--
He's a really good dancer.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.646
What's your favorite move?

02:58.779 --> 03:01.282
It's kind of like a shake.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.816
-A shake? That's...
-I don't know.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.386
I just do whatever
the m-music tells me to do.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.455
There's nothing but douchebags
at these clubs.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.122
-I love it here, man. It's safe.
-Oh, but, come on.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.791
God, you just sit here all day,

03:10.924 --> 03:12.793
-and then smoke weed
and jerk each other off. -Yeah.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.127
That sounds amazing.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.996
I've never been jerked off
by any of my friends.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.231
Me, either.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.566
I like your tattoos.

03:18.699 --> 03:19.900
-I knew you would, right?
-Those are-- (gasps)

03:20.033 --> 03:21.302
-Oh, my God. That...
-No, don't talk to him.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.337
-He has, he has chlamydia.
-I had.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.406
-Oh, my God.
-Had chlamydia.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.507
-It's curable.
-And you introduced me to

03:26.640 --> 03:27.741
the girl that gave me chlamydia,

03:27.875 --> 03:29.009
so you basically
gave me chlamydia.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.444
You assisted the chlamydia.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.612
He doesn't have insurance.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.746
-He can't get the meds.
-TARA: It's fine.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.114
I act-- I actually did
some of those.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.215
TARA:
You did?

03:35.349 --> 03:36.584
You know I got to rep
the island.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.118
-RICHIE: Hey. -Staten Island.
-TARA: Wow, Staten.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.288
-S.I., you know.
-Yeah.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.656
-Looks so good.
-Thank you.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.458
-TARA: You have a bunch
of tattoos also. -Yeah.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.093
-What is that date?
-Oh. -OSCAR: Ooh.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.095
Uh, that's, uh, the date
my Dad died.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.831
Oh, my God, your dad died?
I'm so sorry.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.133
Don't be. It's fine.
It's totally cool.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.435
-So, what happened?
-OSCAR: Ooh!

03:54.568 --> 03:55.603
-KELSEY: Okay, you don't
need to ask. -No.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.371
-No, no, no, no.
-Don't ask that.

03:57.505 --> 03:58.372
It's kind of inappropriate.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.673
Uh, he was a, he was a fireman.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.675
So, he died in a fire.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.811
Oh, my God.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.314
-Yeah, we knew.
-Yeah, we knew.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.881
-We don't like to talk about it.
-We knew.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.483
OSCAR:
That's why we don't bring it up.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.319
-Apologize to Scott.
-It's the right thing to do.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.321
-You should say sorry.
-Apologize or get out.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.055
It's not okay.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.692
Scott, um, I just wanted to say
that I'm really sorry

04:18.826 --> 04:21.362
-that I asked about your tattoo.
-KELSEY: Yeah.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.131
(laughter)

04:24.264 --> 04:26.334
(laughs):
What?

04:26.467 --> 04:27.535
KELSEY:
He doesn't care. It's fine.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.769
-RICHIE: He doesn't care.
-Look at him.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.538
-He's laughing so much.
-SCOTT: I don't care.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.473
We talk about his dead dad
all the time.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.908
(laughter)

04:35.042 --> 04:36.977
-Knock, knock.
-Who's there?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.178
Not your dad.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.713
-(laughter)
-KELSEY: That's my favorite one.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.315
Oh, my God, that's so funny.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.850
We've made so many jokes
about it.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.084
SCOTT (laughing):
Oh, my God, I don't even...

04:44.217 --> 04:46.153
-I don't even miss him at all.
-TARA: So funny.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.187
KELSEY:
Yeah.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.122
(laughter dies down)

04:54.161 --> 04:55.162
(panting) Oh!

04:55.295 --> 04:56.330
Oh, yeah, yeah,
that's pretty good.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.398
Keep-keep doing that!
Keep doing that!

04:57.531 --> 04:58.766
-Are-are you, are you happy?
-(moans)

04:58.899 --> 05:00.768
Yes, yes, it's fucking great!
Keep going!

05:00.901 --> 05:02.002
(moaning)

05:02.135 --> 05:03.404
No, wait, d-d-- don't stop!

05:03.537 --> 05:05.172
(moaning)

05:05.305 --> 05:07.908
(panting)

05:08.041 --> 05:10.110
Did you, um, did you,
did you come?

05:10.243 --> 05:12.279
(laughs):
Well, yes.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.381
Were you there?

05:13.514 --> 05:15.182
(laughs):
Yeah, I did.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.584
-Like, six times.
-Cool.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.218
-Awesome.
-It was great.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.920
-Did you?
-No, no, no.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.423
But it's okay. I-I had fun.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.791
I had fun back there.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.359
(laughs):
Yeah.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.761
You know, I feel bad
that you never do.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.262
No, I-I do all the time.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.699
I just-- you know, I don't put
on a Broadway show like you do.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.100
You know, I'm-I'm more quiet.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.935
I'm more like Charlie Chaplin
when I come.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.404
-Like a silent movie.
-Silent movie.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.439
(laughs)

05:38.572 --> 05:40.941
Um, do you think
it's the antidepressants?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.543
Oh, yeah, for sure.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.111
Yeah. If I didn't have
the antidepressants,

05:44.244 --> 05:45.546
I'd come in, like,
eight seconds.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.747
And then you wouldn't come.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.382
And then you'd be depressed.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.851
And then you would
have to take antidepressants.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.988
-I don't know, can I say
something? I, um... -Yeah.

05:55.122 --> 05:58.992
I just still don't understand
why this is such a big secret.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.995
You know why it's a big secret.
'Cause it's special.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.498
It's-it's, like, our thing,
you know?

06:04.632 --> 06:08.135
It-it wouldn't be special
if everybody knew about it.

06:08.268 --> 06:11.572
Yeah, but I don't
just want to do this.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.774
Yeah, I totally get that.
So, should we stop?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.108
No, I...

06:16.777 --> 06:19.279
I don't know, like, this--
like, what is this?

06:19.413 --> 06:20.848
-And I don't know why...
-This?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.850
-This is... -I want to do
what normal people do.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.452
Yeah, I know.
I just, you know, I--

06:24.585 --> 06:25.986
It-it might be weird, you know.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.955
We've known each other
for, like, ever.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.156
Since fourth grade.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.858
It would be like incest.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.025
(laughs):
No, it wouldn't.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.494
No, it's like, yeah,
w-we're best pals,

06:33.627 --> 06:35.696
and I wouldn't want to, like,
jeopardize our friendship

06:35.829 --> 06:38.666
or something like that
over something--

06:38.799 --> 06:42.269
not silly, but, you know,
it's just-- it's a big risk.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.204
But we've already
done the deed.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.440
-I mean, what else is there?
-"Done the deed"?

06:46.574 --> 06:48.509
-(laughs): I don't know.
-But, you know, it's just,

06:48.642 --> 06:51.211
-you deserve somebody
way better than me. -What?

06:51.344 --> 06:53.280
(chuckles):
You're a good guy.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.115
-You're a good guy. I like you.
-Uh...

06:55.248 --> 06:56.517
Well, I-- Based on what?

06:56.650 --> 06:59.119
I mean, I like you, too.
It's just like...

06:59.252 --> 07:00.988
(sighs)

07:01.121 --> 07:03.190
All right, can I just tell you--
can I tell you something?

07:03.323 --> 07:05.025
But can you, like,
not tell anybody?

07:05.158 --> 07:08.328
Well, people probably know,
but, like... (sighs)

07:08.462 --> 07:10.397
There's, like,
something wrong with me.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.800
-Like, mentally, like...
-What?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.903
Like, I'm not okay up there.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.005
You know? Like...

07:18.138 --> 07:20.340
I-I get all mad,
acting, like, crazy,

07:20.474 --> 07:23.644
and I, and I make really insane,
impulsive decisions.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.345
And I get...

07:25.479 --> 07:29.517
I'm d-- I'm scared o-of myself,
and I don't...

07:29.650 --> 07:31.519
I don't want to,
like, scare you or me

07:31.652 --> 07:33.153
or, like, hurt anyone, you know?

07:33.286 --> 07:35.322
So, I think
it would just be best

07:35.455 --> 07:39.059
and really responsible of me
if I just backed off, you know?

07:41.128 --> 07:43.664
I don't want you to f-feel
like that about yourself.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.499
Oh, no, it's...

07:45.633 --> 07:48.101
I just, I just don't want
to offend you, you know?

07:48.235 --> 07:51.204
You're... you're the best.
I think you're the greatest.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.874
I know you think I'm great.
I'm awesome.

07:55.408 --> 07:58.011
I feel bad that you don't
think you're great.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.815
(alarm beeping)

08:05.018 --> 08:07.020
(sighs)

08:08.689 --> 08:10.691

08:14.728 --> 08:15.929
(exhales)

08:28.208 --> 08:30.443
Hey, honey.

08:30.578 --> 08:33.113
I made you an omelet.

08:33.246 --> 08:37.417
What are you gonna wear to
your sister's graduation party?

08:37.551 --> 08:41.221
I was thinking, what about
one of your dad's suits?

08:41.354 --> 08:42.556
I don't know.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.392
I-I don't think I'm really
a suit guy, you know?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.828
Plus-plus, all those suits
are out of style, so...

08:47.961 --> 08:50.831
You know, I thought
they were back in style.

08:50.964 --> 08:54.768
And... can you not smoke pot
before the party?

08:54.902 --> 08:56.103
Why?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.138
Because it smells.
You smell bad.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.140
And no vaping because
they're gonna think it's pot.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.308
The uncle is a cop.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.810
We don't need
that kind of trouble.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.344
Fuck that guy.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.279
I hate this family.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.782
They're so rich and snooty.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.651
They've been really nice
to Claire.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.352
Hey, Mom. You got me
the plastic containers.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.454
I just need the cardboard boxes
I can throw away.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.657
But they're so good
for storing things.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.491
Yeah, but I don't have
any storage.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.427
-My closet's, like,
two feet wide. -(Margie groans)

09:20.560 --> 09:23.530
Hey, Claire, do you even want me
at your graduation party?

09:23.664 --> 09:26.333
Do I want you to go?
I don't care.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.136
Just-- It's weird
if you don't go.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.638
That wasn't exactly
a warm invitation.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.505
Yeah, well, it's not the part
I'm looking forward to most.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.141
But I want you to be there.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.109
-MARGIE: She wants you to go.
-SCOTT: No, she doesn't.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.978
-She just said it. -CLAIRE:
No, I don't want him to go.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.513
He has to go.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.016
Just don't sit on the couch
in the corner the whole time.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.517
-It's weird. -SCOTT:
No, I don't see the problem

09:44.652 --> 09:45.853
with sitting
in the corner, okay?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.788
There's some people
that go to the party and dance,

09:47.921 --> 09:49.657
and there's some people
that sit in the corner.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.658
I'm the corner guy.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.060
Accept your brother.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.295
Also, don't try
to fuck Layla, okay?

09:55.428 --> 09:56.964
She told you
she's not interested.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.465
What are you talking about?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.133
I never tried
to hook up with her.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.870
She's always trying to fuck me,
and I-I have to avoid it

10:03.003 --> 10:06.674
at all costs,
out of respect for you.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.142
I just thought she looked
really good in those pants.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.144
-Jesus. -Thought that was
a nice thing to say.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.681
-Just don't. -I didn't know
I would get MeToo'd for it.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.515
Dad's suits are vacuum-sealed
in the garage.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.417
-Yeah?
-Just pick yourself a nice one.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.986
You have to look nice.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.221
We're celebrating
your sister's achievements.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.556
You're gonna miss her
when she's gone.

10:23.691 --> 10:26.393
Yeah. Celebrate me.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.752
(sniffing)

11:01.161 --> 11:02.562
(exhales, clears throat)

11:03.997 --> 11:06.199
Wow, this, uh...
this all happened so fast.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.335
I-I can't believe
you're graduating already.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.707
I'm gonna really miss you.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.214
ANNOUNCER (over TV):
Round two.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.449
-Fight!
-(buttons clicking)

11:22.582 --> 11:24.551
SCOTT:
Yo, where'd you get this?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.619
This shit does not taste
very good.

11:26.754 --> 11:29.322
What are you talking about?
This shit's fire, dawg.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.224
Do you guys even really
get high anymore?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.659
I-I don't really think
I get high anymore.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.062
I think I just
kind of am myself.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.930
I haven't been high
in a while, man.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.465
But I still do it.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.500
I like the lifestyle.

11:40.633 --> 11:41.902
RICHIE:
I'm mad high.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.670
OSCAR:
Yo, tell Scotty about

11:43.804 --> 11:45.172
how you're being catfished.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.239
-Who?
-You!

11:46.373 --> 11:47.407
RICHIE:
How you're being catfished, bro.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.475
Tell him the truth.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.576
You got a girlfriend?
What's up?

11:49.709 --> 11:50.677
-No.
-IGOR: Yeah.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.145
-(chuckles): That's awesome.
-Yes.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.613
-(Richie chuckles)
-Her name is Carla.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.849
-We talk on the phone.
-RICHIE: Nah, dude.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.585
Like, this girl, like,
slid into his DMs, and, like,

11:58.718 --> 12:00.453
I don't know, she, like,
asked him out or whatever.

12:00.587 --> 12:01.989
-But hundred percent a trick,
dude. -OSCAR: She...

12:02.122 --> 12:03.623
-She's bad, but that's
not yours. -SCOTT: Why?

12:03.757 --> 12:05.125
RICHIE:
And she's, like, so hot, dude.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.127
Yo, she, like,
hangs out on yachts.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.328
-Like, yo.
-Oh, come on.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.797
-No, no, like, no.
-Dude...

12:09.930 --> 12:10.964
Like, it's not real, like...

12:11.098 --> 12:12.432
Bro, they're just
being jealous, bro.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.801
They're just jealous
'cause you're getting that--

12:13.934 --> 12:15.202
Oh, yeah, that's a catfish.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.104
Oh, you getting catfished
like a motherfucker!

12:17.237 --> 12:18.338
-Oh, my God!
-RICHIE: Right, dude?

12:18.471 --> 12:19.973
-Bro...
-SCOTT: What does she...

12:20.107 --> 12:22.342
Straight up, I'm-a send myself
this one, honestly.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.045
Honestly, dude,
she's fucking fake.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.814
She thinks I'm hot.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.049
How? You guys never even
seen each other.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.483
How come you guys
don't FaceTime?

12:30.617 --> 12:32.385
Tell Scotty
why you don't FaceTime.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.855
Her phone camera's broken, but
she sent me all these photos.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.556
-RICHIE: Yeah. -OSCAR:
Bro, these are Google Images.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.158
-RICHIE: Exactly, dude. -SCOTT:
Shit, you don't know that.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.827
Maybe-maybe this girl is,
uh, is into Igor.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.229
Well, you know,
he's-he's, you know, cute.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.798
OSCAR: Yo, like, you don't even
know how to talk to girls.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.399
What do you even
talk to her about?

12:46.533 --> 12:47.534
(knocking on glass)

12:47.667 --> 12:49.502
-OSCAR: Igor.
-IGOR: Mm-hmm.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.239
Go get that shit, bro.
What are you doing?

12:52.372 --> 12:54.241
Yo, he is the worst assistant.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.542
SCOTT: He's clearly
going through a lot.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.544
How much for, like, six Xanax?

12:57.677 --> 12:58.745
Six.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.547
What do we have?
What do we have?

13:00.680 --> 13:03.050
-Who needs six Xanax?
-IGOR: I got one, two...

13:03.183 --> 13:04.484
I got three right here, I think.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.552
One, two...

13:05.685 --> 13:07.754
Is this a... Yeah.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.556
-How you doing?
-I'm all right.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.025
Yo, you're Jimmy Bags' brother,
right?

13:12.159 --> 13:14.661
-Yes, bro.
-(chuckles)

13:14.794 --> 13:17.898
Tell your brother he's a bitch.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.067
-You understand that?
-Yeah. I do.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.402
-Say it back to me.
-He's a bitch. He's a bitch.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.671
And now, you know what?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.506
I got four,
but you're paying for six.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.241
Nah, come on.
That's my fucking brother, bro.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.776
-Like, what are you...
-Nah. Nah, dude.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.011
I hate your brother.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.846
And now you look like
a little version of him,

13:32.980 --> 13:34.447
and I want to punch you
in the face.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.250
So, instead of doing that,
just give me 60.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.551
I only got 40.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.220
Then go home, do chores,
and come back.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.554
-I don't give a fuck.
-I-I can't.

13:41.688 --> 13:44.091
I stole it from my mom's purse,
but she only had 40.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.459
Well, then, give me your shoes.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.061
No, bro, I can't.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.462
OSCAR: Just give me your shoes
and we'll call it a day.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.932
-Hey, what size are you?
-(scoffs) Like, a nine.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.266
Those'll fit you.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.634
-Igor, you can have those.
-IGOR: I'll take 'em.

13:54.767 --> 13:55.869
OSCAR:
Look at that, Igor got a gift.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.637
-He's not a fucking nine.
-Fuck you!

13:57.770 --> 13:59.239
You don't make fun of my friend!

13:59.372 --> 14:00.507
He-he can't get on
fucking roller coasters,

14:00.640 --> 14:01.841
-he's that small.
-Shut the fuck up! -Whoa!

14:01.975 --> 14:03.143
-We make fun of him!
-How is he gonna wear them?

14:03.276 --> 14:04.711
-You don't make fun of him!
-He's our friend.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.279
He rides roller coasters
all the time.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.048
We make fun of him, not you.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.549
He's, like, a size five,
bro, like...

14:09.682 --> 14:10.717
Yo! Stop!

14:10.850 --> 14:12.719
Get the fuck away
from my window.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.721
You guys are a bunch
of fucking pussies.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.324
Mom, he's saying he's gonna wear
these cargo shorts to the party.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.458
Oh, no.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.660
What? I told you
to wear Dad's suit.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.662
I don't want to wear
Dad's old suit, okay?

14:22.795 --> 14:24.797
-I have my own personal style,
and I... -Get the fuck off me!

14:24.932 --> 14:27.067
-Don't do that! -I-I don't
want to wear a suit, okay?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.802
-(arguing continues) -I think,
I think I'm gonna throw up.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.838
I think I have the flu.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.007
Oh, oh, okay. Just-just breathe
through your nose.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.642
(breathing through nose)
One second.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.144
Oh, shut up.
Mom, he looks like

14:37.277 --> 14:38.979
he fucking sells crack
under a bridge.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.348
I know the guy who sells crack
under the bridge, okay?

14:41.481 --> 14:42.449
And he looks awesome.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.751
Just put on the suit,
Scott, please.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.953
No! It's not fair!

14:46.086 --> 14:47.420
She thinks she's, like,
princess of the world...

14:47.554 --> 14:48.588
Okay, well, then just please

14:48.721 --> 14:49.756
be respectful for
two fucking seconds!

14:49.889 --> 14:50.757
...because she graduated
high school.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.759
Everybody graduates high school!

14:52.892 --> 14:54.061
-CLAIRE: Shut up!
-Scott!

14:54.194 --> 14:55.695
-* Oh, she's a jolly
good fellow * -Oh.

14:55.828 --> 14:56.696
-Mom, please...
-(singing continues)

14:56.829 --> 14:58.265
Just put on the suit.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.266
Be respectful.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.633
I'll be home in an hour.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.535
Fine!

15:02.669 --> 15:03.770
CLAIRE:
Thank you.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.505
(sighs)

15:05.638 --> 15:07.107
How are you feeling?

15:11.144 --> 15:12.946
I'm sorry.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.049
I tried to warn you,
but you were on the phone.

15:16.183 --> 15:19.052
Thanks for letting me
use your phone.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.654
My family has problems, too.

15:21.788 --> 15:22.990
CLAIRE:
I love this house.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.391
SCOTT:
If you have money,

15:24.524 --> 15:27.127
why would you ever
live in Staten Island?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.129
* *

15:29.262 --> 15:31.264
(girls laughing)

15:32.932 --> 15:34.234
(Margie chuckles)

15:34.367 --> 15:36.469
-CLAIRE: Oh, God. Yeah.
-JOANNE: So good.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.871
JOANNE'S MOTHER:
We are so proud

15:39.006 --> 15:40.540
of our daughter Joanne--

15:40.673 --> 15:43.476
and Claire, who's been at
our house so much over the years

15:43.610 --> 15:45.312
you feel like
our second daughter.

15:45.445 --> 15:49.149
Thank you, Margie, for lending
her to us all these years.

15:49.282 --> 15:54.554
You guys have worked so hard,
and we are so, so proud of you.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.657
(quietly): Jesus Christ, dial
it back, you fucking fruits.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.658
JOANNE'S FATHER:
Joanne,

15:58.791 --> 16:01.194
you are a very special girl.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.863
You made our dreams
come true, too.

16:03.997 --> 16:04.931
You're my sweet angel.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.899
No, she's not.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.668
It's such an honor
to be your parents.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.071
You've taught us as much as
we've taught you. Claire...

16:11.204 --> 16:12.939
JOANNE'S MOTHER:
You've been through so much,

16:13.073 --> 16:14.274
and you've done so well,

16:14.407 --> 16:16.443
so much better than any of us
could have handled it.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.445
Your dad Stan would be
so proud of you.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.080
He's looking down at you
right now.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.281
Yes, he is.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.715
No, he's not.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.851
A toast to Joanne and Claire.

16:24.984 --> 16:25.952
-JOANNE'S FATHER: So proud.
-(scattered cheers)

16:26.086 --> 16:28.288
Congratulations!

16:28.421 --> 16:29.522
-(Lizzo's "Juice" playing)
-GIRLS: * Please don't *

16:29.656 --> 16:30.857
* Make me have to take
your bitch *

16:30.990 --> 16:32.459
* How I roll, if I'm shining *

16:32.592 --> 16:34.861
* Everybody gonna shine... *

16:34.994 --> 16:37.530
-What's up, Todd?
-What's up, Scott?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.299
You going to college,
too, someday?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.134
I'd like to, yeah.
I'd go study law.

16:41.268 --> 16:42.635
Oh, yeah?
That's awesome, man.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.637
That sounds really cool.
Do you have any weed?

16:44.771 --> 16:46.273
-I do.
-Could I have some?

16:46.406 --> 16:48.608
-Definitely. I'll go grab it.
-Cool. Thanks, Todd.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.378
Fucking home run, Todd.

16:51.511 --> 16:55.482
It makes me sad
to think of my little sister

16:55.615 --> 16:57.150
sitting in
that sad little house,

16:57.284 --> 16:59.152
-waiting for her son
to be perfect. -(mutters)

16:59.286 --> 17:01.788
(chuckles):
I'm not.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.223
Then you're wasting all of this.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.058
All of it's getting wasted.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.559
-You're a mess.
-You're wasted.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.328
Mom would be so disappoin-- Mom
would be disappointed in you.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.729
You're the one
who's always wasted.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.798
You're wasting. It's like
leaving food on the table.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.400
(both laugh)

17:13.532 --> 17:14.800
Come on.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.836
-Let me take you out.
-It's so hard to meet people.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.438
-I'm totally open.
-No, it's-- I mean, God...

17:18.570 --> 17:19.839
You're not open at all.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.340
-It's really hard to meet
people. -You're a liar.

17:21.473 --> 17:22.775
You're not open.
"Hard to meet people"?

17:22.909 --> 17:24.344
-I'm in the E.R. All I see
is, like... -You meet--

17:24.477 --> 17:26.246
-You meet a hundred people
a night. -People who were shot--

17:26.378 --> 17:27.614
Yeah, they're shot.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.782
They're-they're, uh,
they're criminals.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.151
-Stop limiting yourself.
-Who am I gonna meet?

17:31.284 --> 17:32.152
Stop limiting yourself.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.586
-But I'm at the hospital.
-Yeah.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.887
-They're not all criminals.
-You meet people at work.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.456
-That's what it's...
-Some of them are victims.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.191
Doll...

17:38.325 --> 17:40.927
You know, we could put you on
two shifts a week,

17:41.060 --> 17:43.530
-just-just, just to try it.
-I don't need a job.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.132
I, uh, I got a contact
at a tattoo shop.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.833
I'm-I'm hoping for
an apprenticeship, so...

17:46.966 --> 17:48.535
Then you're gonna need
some money.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.271
Yeah, some of these guys
walk away with 80 bucks in tips.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.673
Scott, your cousin's offering
you a job. Consider it, okay?

17:53.806 --> 17:55.775
If you're good at it,
you can become a waiter.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.710
Why are you offering me
a job anyway?

17:57.844 --> 18:01.181
Because I told your father
I'd always look out for you.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.150
How?
He died suddenly in a fire.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.717
Uh, did you ask his ghost?

18:04.851 --> 18:07.287
That's not witty, Scott.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.289
Your dark sense of humor
doesn't work for me.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.523
I find it funny.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.426
It's your sister's big day.
Be a gentleman.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.630
Okay, we lost a few guys
in an ICE raid.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.832
Ah, shit. Sorry.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.701
Maybe you should work
and go to college.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.837
-College is bullshit!
-Oh.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.873
You know who went to Harvard?
The Unabomber.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.876
You know who went to Temple?
Bill Cosby.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.345
You know who else who went
to Temple? Ted Bundy.

18:32.479 --> 18:35.515
You know who went to Hofstra?
Bernie Madoff.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.984
You know who went to Wharton?
Donald Trump.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.286
It's all a scam.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.989
Okay, well, maybe
I shouldn't go, then.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.525
Oh, no, you'll have
the time of your life.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.860
CLAIRE:
Hey, Scott.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.530
Sit down.

18:50.663 --> 18:51.764
Okay.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.166
I got you this.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.779
So, what-what is, uh,
what is, what is this?

19:06.913 --> 19:09.148
It's paintbrushes
and some paint.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.119
Well, I know you're into art,
so I thought you could

19:13.253 --> 19:14.887
expand your horizons
while I'm gone.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.790
You got a gift receipt for this?

19:17.924 --> 19:20.092
-You okay?
-Fine-- Yeah.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.294
Wh-What do you mean?
Yeah, I'm...

19:21.428 --> 19:22.729
You gonna be okay
without me here?

19:22.862 --> 19:25.565
What, you don't think I can
survive here without you?

19:25.698 --> 19:27.367
Okay, just don't be
a dick, okay?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.203
Like, be nice to Mom, okay?
Don't give her a hard time.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.539
-She deserves a break.
-I always give her a-a break.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.774
What are you-- When's--
When am I gonna get my break?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.042
Like...

19:36.175 --> 19:37.444
What are you talking about?

19:37.577 --> 19:39.746
All anyone ever does
is worry about you.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.814
I was ignored my entire
childhood 'cause of you.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.484
Oh, yeah, I forgot that
my childhood was so dandy.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.985
Okay, you don't get
to act crazy your whole life

19:46.118 --> 19:47.119
just 'cause Dad died, okay?

19:47.254 --> 19:48.655
At least you got to know him.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.257
Well, you're lucky you didn't
get to know him, okay?

19:50.390 --> 19:51.624
'Cause that's why
you're almost normal.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.593
If you got to know him,
you would've known that he was,

19:53.726 --> 19:55.562
like, the fucking
coolest guy ever,

19:55.695 --> 19:57.564
and that would've
ruined the rest of your life.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.566
Okay, like,
but what are you gonna do?

19:59.699 --> 20:02.435
Are you gonna get a job or
are you gonna leave the house?

20:02.569 --> 20:03.670
I don't know.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.273
I-I'm gonna open
that tattoo restaurant.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.840
No, like, for real.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.309
I am being real.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.810
It's a great--
It's never been done before.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.345
I looked it up.
I googled it.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.113
It's never been done,
not even as a joke.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.416
Because no one wants
to go to a restaurant

20:16.549 --> 20:18.618
and watch people get tattooed
while they eat.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.653
-It's gross.
-It's the best idea ever.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.122
Ruby Tattoosdays,
where everyone's welcome.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.957
-Chicken and tattoos.
-That's not a business!

20:25.091 --> 20:26.759
You know, you got to get
your shit together.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.160
Time is passing by very quickly.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.096
That's why I smoke weed
all the time, okay?

20:30.229 --> 20:31.197
It slows it all down.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.933
(sighs):
Fucking God.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.802
See, I'm worried about you.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.537
Well, why now?
You never gave a shit.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.539
You, like, literally never
cared until this second.

20:39.672 --> 20:40.873
Like, wh-what, what gives?

20:41.007 --> 20:42.642
You never looked out
for me once.

20:42.775 --> 20:43.710
You're my older brother.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.144
You're supposed
to look out for me.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.779
You're-you're just guilty
'cause you're leaving?

20:46.913 --> 20:48.348
Now, all of a sudden,
you're afraid I'm gonna die?

20:48.481 --> 20:50.717
I was gonna die anyway,
whether you stay or not.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.885
-Are you gonna hurt yourself?
-Probably.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.454
Yeah, I'm probably
gonna hurt myself.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.188
I don't know how, but yeah.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.960
If anybody could do it, it's me.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.730
This is why I don't talk to you,
'cause the one thing I know is

21:03.863 --> 21:06.299
you're not gonna listen
to my advice, so...

21:06.433 --> 21:07.534
SCOTT:
Yeah, well, why would I?

21:07.667 --> 21:08.801
Like, you don't even
give a shit.

21:08.935 --> 21:09.869
You're-you're leaving.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.237
You're not even
part of the family.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.139
I'm the only fucking
normal person in this family.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.041
Jesus. You know--

21:15.174 --> 21:17.510
Every second I'm away from you,
I'm worrying about you.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.011
That's what you do to people.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.513
You should be worried.

21:20.647 --> 21:23.816
Okay, don't fucking
ruin college for me, okay?

21:23.950 --> 21:24.817
Go!

21:24.951 --> 21:26.519
Fine.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.388
Hey, you should bring that
chipper personality to college.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.156
Guys will love it.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.092
(over TV):
Hello.

21:33.225 --> 21:34.093
(gags)

21:34.226 --> 21:37.397
(groaning)

21:37.530 --> 21:41.167
-Okay, let's see my to-do list.
-(Scott chuckles)

21:41.300 --> 21:44.103
Yo, we're finished
packing the car.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.272
You want to come out
and say goodbye or...?

21:46.406 --> 21:48.408
Oh, well, yeah,
this is almost over.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.710
No, like, we're leaving.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.412
-Oh. She's leaving? -Like,
to go to college, you know?

21:52.545 --> 21:54.046
-Oh, oh, my bad.
-Yeah, four years, so...

21:54.180 --> 21:55.882
-Oh, all right.
-Let's go.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.184
Nope, like-- Go. Come on.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.353
Uh, don't worry about me, okay?

22:00.487 --> 22:02.422
This is really hard right now.
(laughs)

22:02.555 --> 22:04.691
-You don't seem fine.
-(sobs)

22:04.824 --> 22:07.560
I'm so proud of you.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.096
(sobs)

22:10.229 --> 22:12.264
I love you.

22:12.399 --> 22:13.265
Uh, okay.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.934
(laughs)

22:15.067 --> 22:17.604
You're the light of my life.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.238
CLAIRE:
Oh. (sniffling)

22:19.372 --> 22:20.239
Okay. (laughs)

22:20.373 --> 22:21.908
(Claire sighs)

22:23.242 --> 22:25.044
Thanks for helping us
pack the car.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.312
SCOTT:
I'm sorry.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.615
I didn't realize
you guys were done already.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.551
Be nice to Mom.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.086
And please respond to my texts.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.822
I will. Don't worry about it.

22:35.955 --> 22:39.392
And, um... I-I'll come
visit you at some point.

22:40.427 --> 22:41.293
(smacks lips)

22:41.428 --> 22:42.829
Okay. All right.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.230
-Yeah.
-(sighs)

22:44.363 --> 22:45.998
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.099
(sniffles)

22:47.233 --> 22:49.869
-MARGIE: Fly.
-(laughs)

22:51.571 --> 22:52.972
(whimpers)

22:53.105 --> 22:54.807
(car door closes)

22:54.941 --> 22:56.142
(engine starts)

22:57.944 --> 22:59.446
(over stereo):
* Keep on hoping we'll eat *

22:59.579 --> 23:01.448
-* Cake by the ocean *
-(Claire whoops)

23:01.581 --> 23:03.583
-* Talk to me, baby... *
-(music fades)

23:13.059 --> 23:14.494
SCOTT (quietly):
Hey.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.663
(chuckles softly)
Hey.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.798
Uh...

23:18.931 --> 23:21.601
I was thinking of finally
seeing that Game of Thrones.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.603
Should I binge it?

23:23.736 --> 23:25.171
Oh, it's a,
it's a pretty violent show.

23:25.304 --> 23:27.006
You sure you could watch that?

23:27.139 --> 23:29.476
I work in an emergency room.

23:29.609 --> 23:30.710
Right, yeah.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.212
So, you could probably handle
a good pillage.

23:33.345 --> 23:34.380
Yeah.

23:34.514 --> 23:37.216
Okay, well, maybe
I'll start watching it.

23:37.349 --> 23:38.851
-Yeah.
-You watch it with me?

23:38.985 --> 23:42.989
Um, well, I actually just kind
of finished it, so I-I don't--

23:43.122 --> 23:45.492
It's really fresh in my mind,
so I-I would probably...

23:45.625 --> 23:46.959
-Okay.
-I can watch some of them.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.629
Uh, I don't think I can watch
all of them again, but...

23:49.762 --> 23:51.363
-Well...
-I'll see you later, then.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.365
All right.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.367
Uh, are you okay?

23:55.502 --> 23:58.337
Or... (grunts)

23:58.471 --> 23:59.539
Oh. Yeah?

23:59.672 --> 24:00.540
-Come on.
-(sniffles)

24:00.673 --> 24:02.241
Uh, it's, it-it's...

24:02.374 --> 24:03.843
It's okay. It's--

24:03.976 --> 24:06.078
I-I'm here. Uh, I'm here.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.314
Don't-don't worry about it.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.448
-She's, you know...
-(sobs)

24:09.582 --> 24:11.584
Well, she's only, like,
45 minutes away,

24:11.718 --> 24:14.621
and she'll-she'll probably
call in, like, five minutes.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.389
-(sniffles)
-But, hey.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.726
You still got me, right?

24:21.193 --> 24:22.729
Yeah.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.034
Oh, shit.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.902
-(laughing)
-Hey, hey!

24:31.337 --> 24:33.940
OSCAR: See, you got to
hold it like this.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.675
TARA:
Let's see. Oh.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.144
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh!

24:39.178 --> 24:40.680
Hey, hey, wait. Hey, hey, guys.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.682
Look, look.

24:42.815 --> 24:43.916
You can't be here, man.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.618
-Y-You got to go.
-KELSEY: Why?

24:45.752 --> 24:47.920
GUARD: It's private property,
that's why.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.256
It's an abandoned orphanage.
Why can't we be here?

24:50.389 --> 24:51.558
RICHIE:
Who gives a shit, man?

24:51.691 --> 24:52.859
What are you doing here?

24:52.992 --> 24:54.426
You fucking protecting
the ghosts of dead orphans?

24:54.561 --> 24:57.429
Look, fat Kanye,
shut your damn mouth.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.966
I'll be back in five minutes
for you assholes.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.234
If you're still here,
I'm calling the cops, period.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.537
You better get the cops, man,
'cause you're a fake cop.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.305
-You need the real ones.
-GUARD: Motherfuckers.

25:06.438 --> 25:08.407
-Fuck all of y'all.
-IGOR: I feel bad.

25:08.541 --> 25:09.876
We-we were a little too mean.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.477
-SCOTT: Yeah.
-He's nice.

25:11.611 --> 25:12.912
Yeah, he's a really good guy.

25:13.045 --> 25:17.449
See, that guy-- that is what is
wrong with Staten Island.

25:17.584 --> 25:20.486
We don't get any cool people
from any of the other boroughs.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.854
No one comes here.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.090
We're stuck with the
fucking pricks that live here.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.758
You're talking about us.

25:25.892 --> 25:27.126
Right in front of us.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.127
KELSEY:
Yeah, kinda.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.796
I mean, no one comes here.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.598
There's no flow of people.
That guy's, like, 200.

25:31.731 --> 25:32.999
We've known him
since we were six.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.901
Why can't we be cool
like Brooklyn?

25:35.034 --> 25:36.836
There's no reason we shouldn't
be cool like Brooklyn.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.338
We got amazing views.
It's close to the city.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.641
It's cheap. Nice people.
It makes no sense.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.110
We're, like, the only place
that New Jersey looks down on.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.979
-You could see the garbage dump
from space. -(Tara laughs)

25:47.113 --> 25:48.748
This place is
never gonna change.

25:48.881 --> 25:49.982
No, it happened to
the Meatpacking District,

25:50.116 --> 25:51.183
the Village.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.119
Brooklyn used to be
a fucking shithole.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.253
We are next.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.554
I'm gonna take
my civil service test.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.757
I'm gonna work in the city,
in city planning.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.926
You watch, this place is gonna
be like fucking Williamsburg

26:00.059 --> 26:02.428
-in ten years. -RICHIE: No, all
right? No. Nobody wants that.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.697
Why do you want to work in
the city and do city planning?

26:04.831 --> 26:05.698
That sounds so boring.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.199
I feel like Brooklyn is better.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.801
I dated a guy
that lived in Brooklyn.

26:08.935 --> 26:09.936
He was a mixologist.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.538
He made ice cubes out of milk.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.707
-He was so classy.
-OSCAR: Shut up!

26:14.841 --> 26:16.643
I love Staten Island.

26:16.776 --> 26:17.877
It's amazing.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.712
And people are gonna
see it soon, trust me.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.313
SCOTT:
Well, if you love it so much,

26:21.447 --> 26:22.849
why don't you let me
tattoo it on you?

26:22.982 --> 26:24.851
No, I'm not gonna let you
tattoo me again.

26:24.984 --> 26:25.852
Fine.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.988
Well, I need somebody to tattoo.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.556
I'm, I-I'm running out of...

26:30.690 --> 26:31.891
Come on, Rich.
What about you, man?

26:32.024 --> 26:34.026
-Don't even look at me, dude.
-Why?

26:34.160 --> 26:35.895
Your work is mad inconsistent.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.329
Obama ain't right.

26:37.463 --> 26:38.698
SCOTT:
I got the eyes wrong, okay?

26:38.831 --> 26:39.966
RICHIE:
He's not right.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.068
All right, man,
this has hurt me, all right?

26:42.201 --> 26:43.670
I don't have
any black friends anymore.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.638
I can't go to
a barber shop no more.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.474
You got Obama wrong.
Ain't nothing worse than that.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.743
What about you, Igor?
You want a dragon or something?

26:50.877 --> 26:52.244
Oh, I love your tattoos.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.479
My brother?

26:53.612 --> 26:54.914
It's a spitting image.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.315
-SCOTT: Yeah. It's one of
the best. -It's my favorite.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.717
No, no, no, no.
This is my favorite.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.085
Oh, you killed that.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.419
-Yeah, I really worked hard
on the eyes. -Just...

27:00.552 --> 27:02.655
He's so cute.
I love his butthole.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.523
It reminds me that I have
a belly button.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.492
-So, I'm good.
-Yeah, I got to go.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.528
(chuckles): Watching you beg
to give tattoos is too sad.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.931
(laughs):
And that's freaking me out.

27:12.064 --> 27:13.565
-(tattoo gun buzzing)
-SCOTT: We're almost done.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.834
-(Igor groans)
-Almost.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.769
(panting sharply)

27:16.903 --> 27:18.504
(seabirds squawking in distance)

27:18.637 --> 27:19.872
All right.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.540
-You're all done.
-That looks really good.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.175
Yeah, I mean, I wish

27:23.309 --> 27:25.011
you'd let me do
something cooler, but yeah.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.779
Oh, fuck no.
That hurts so bad.

27:26.913 --> 27:29.181
-Another dumb tattoo. -SCOTT:
Yeah, but I-I like the pain.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.517
The-the pain is the whole point
of getting tattoos.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.052
Don't you just love
when you're getting tattooed,

27:33.185 --> 27:34.854
and it hits the bone
and pinches a nerve,

27:34.987 --> 27:36.022
and you're like...
(pained groan)

27:36.155 --> 27:37.857
I'm not a fan of the pain.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.358
You shouldn't let him
do it to you, all right?

27:39.491 --> 27:40.559
He's inconsistent.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.561
OSCAR:
I think that tattoo's dumb.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.463
Y'all should've told me
when you saw the design.

27:44.596 --> 27:45.664
It says, "Unfollow me."

27:45.798 --> 27:47.199
You don't even have
that many followers.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.435
Carla follows me.

27:49.568 --> 27:51.037
-Bro, she's imaginary.
-OSCAR: Carla not real.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.371
Carla's not real, dude.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.406
RICHIE: How many times
do we have to say this?

27:54.540 --> 27:56.242
-SCOTT: She's not real.
-(insect buzzing)

27:56.375 --> 27:57.710
I hate bugs, dawg.

27:57.844 --> 27:58.878
I'm a gangster!

27:59.011 --> 28:00.246
SCOTT:
No, that's a bee, bro!

28:00.379 --> 28:02.448
OSCAR:
There's a kid down there.

28:02.581 --> 28:03.983
-Yo, kid!
-(chuckles): Oh, yo.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.952
-Yo, kid, what's up?
-Oh, shit, there is a kid.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.619
What are you doing?

28:07.754 --> 28:09.388
You hanging out on the beach?
Come here, come here.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.623
Don't-don't be shy.
No stranger danger here.

28:11.758 --> 28:12.892
I'm not gonna touch you.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.260
-What's up, pal?
-What are you doing?

28:14.393 --> 28:15.494
I'm looking for my friend.

28:15.627 --> 28:16.896
(mocking):
"Looking for my friend."

28:17.029 --> 28:19.465
-(Richie laughs)
-You want to be friends with us?

28:19.598 --> 28:21.734
We're the good guys, right?

28:21.868 --> 28:22.935
-You can hang out with us, pal.
-Come on.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.937
Let me get some of that.
Put it right there.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.272
-(fists bump)
-(imitates explosion)

28:26.405 --> 28:28.640
-Ho! (laughs)
-You gang.

28:28.775 --> 28:29.976
Part of the gang.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.443
SCOTT:
Gang.

28:31.577 --> 28:32.611
What's that?

28:32.745 --> 28:33.846
Uh, it's a tattoo gun.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.281
I was giving the homeys tattoos.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.483
-I want a tattoo.
-(laughter)

28:37.616 --> 28:39.518
-You're a tough guy?
-SCOTT: Really?

28:39.651 --> 28:41.821
-Sure, young guy.
You want a tattoo? -Yeah.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.123
Dude, kid wants a tattoo.
That's my guy right there.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.324
Bro, you-you can't
give him a tattoo.

28:45.457 --> 28:46.759
-He's a little kid.
-Yeah, there we go.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.660
-You want a tattoo? -Bro,
I got to practice on something.

28:48.795 --> 28:50.096
-Yeah.
-He seems old enough.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.798
-OSCAR: You a tough guy?
-Yeah.

28:51.931 --> 28:52.999
-You a badass.
-(laughter)

28:53.132 --> 28:54.466
Come on,
show those muscles, kid.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.168
-Come on. Both arms, both arms.
-RICHIE: Yeah, there you go.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.170
-Put 'em up. -SCOTT: You got
tickets to the gun show?

28:58.304 --> 28:59.939
-There it is. There it is.
-All right. -There we go.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.440
-What's your name?
-Harold.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.708
I'm-a call you Harry.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.276
Don't. It's Harold.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.045
-Oh.
-RICHIE (chuckles): Okay.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.980
-Hell yeah.
-I like this kid.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.715
I need him in my life.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.117
He has structure.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.318
(lighter clicks)

29:12.451 --> 29:14.053
Guys, I don't think
that's a good idea.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.889
I mean... we don't listen
to anything you say.

29:17.023 --> 29:19.325
-Yeah. -Yeah, I mean, why do
you even try to give us advice?

29:19.458 --> 29:21.460
SCOTT: So, what do you want
a tattoo of?

29:21.593 --> 29:22.461
The Punisher.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.163
-The Punisher?
-RICHIE: Okay.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.798
-That's tough, man.
-SCOTT: All right.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.300
He could've said anything.
He said The Punisher.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.336
Oh, yeah, I could do that.
Is that it?

29:30.469 --> 29:31.570
Yeah, that's him.

29:31.703 --> 29:33.806
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.742
Do I have your legal permission
to do this?

29:36.876 --> 29:38.477
-Yes.
-That's good enough for me.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.079
-How about you guys?
-OSCAR: Holds up in court.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.247
You guys heard it. All right.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.849
Yo, he can't get consent.
He's ten.

29:42.982 --> 29:46.185
Now, hold still, okay?
'Cause it is permanent.

29:46.318 --> 29:49.021
Yo, guys. Stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

29:49.155 --> 29:50.722
-Put your game face on.
-SCOTT: Don't worry, dude.

29:50.857 --> 29:53.325
This will just be on you
for the rest of your life.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.261
-(tattoo gun buzzing)
-There you go.

29:55.394 --> 29:56.929
-Look at you, tough guy.
-RICHIE: There you go.

29:57.063 --> 29:59.098
-(screams) I don't want
to do it! -Uh...

29:59.231 --> 30:00.566
-I don't wanna!
-Well, I got to finish it.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.101
-Now there's just a line.
-OSCAR: Calm down, man.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.903
-You're gonna look stupid. Sit
back down. Relax. -Calm down.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.437
-Sit down. Do it.
-Relax.

30:05.571 --> 30:06.906
-RICHIE: Whoa! Hey!
-Hey! -Hey!

30:07.039 --> 30:08.740
-Hey, run! Run, kid!
-Hey!

30:08.875 --> 30:10.776
Run, little man! Run!

30:10.910 --> 30:12.611
Run!

30:12.744 --> 30:14.246
Goddamn it.

30:14.380 --> 30:15.948
I fucking believed
in that kid, man.

30:16.082 --> 30:19.551
He seemed so tough at first,
uh, but then immediately wasn't.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.420
That's why I don't fuck
with millennials, dude.

30:21.553 --> 30:24.723
Again, we are the millennials.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.725
He keeps saying that, but
I don't know what that means.

30:26.859 --> 30:29.761
I regret my friendship
with you guys.

30:29.896 --> 30:32.598
(heavy knocking)

30:41.507 --> 30:43.209
Yeah, hello.
My name's Raymond Bishop.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.411
This is my son, Harold.
Say hello, Harold.

30:45.544 --> 30:46.745
I'm sorry.

30:46.879 --> 30:48.915
What's going on?

30:49.048 --> 30:50.582
Well, it seems your son
was down in the woods

30:50.716 --> 30:52.885
giving out free tattoos, and
my son was one of his victims.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.887
What?
Well, I-I don't understand.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.489
How do you know it was my son?
How'd you get this address?

30:57.623 --> 30:59.825
I have my ways.
Believe me, I have my ways.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.027
Are you a cop?

31:01.160 --> 31:02.728
No, I'm a fireman, okay?
I work for a living.

31:02.861 --> 31:03.996
Look at this.
Do you believe this?

31:04.130 --> 31:05.797
You see that there?
See that line?

31:05.932 --> 31:07.666
I don't know if you
burn these off or what,

31:07.799 --> 31:08.935
but we're taking care of this

31:09.068 --> 31:10.302
and you're paying for it,
you understand me?

31:10.436 --> 31:12.638
-I don't know what this is.
-Scott! Oh.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.306
I am-- I'm so sorry.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.908
I-I-I...

31:16.042 --> 31:17.977
There's an aesthetic laser
at the hospital where I work,

31:18.110 --> 31:19.946
and it can completely remove it.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.313
Uh, I get a discount.

31:21.447 --> 31:22.781
I'm-I'm gonna pay
for the whole thing.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.616
I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm-- I feel terrible.

31:24.750 --> 31:25.617
You should feel terrible!

31:25.751 --> 31:26.953
Look at that!

31:27.086 --> 31:28.955
-What's up? Oh, fuck.
-Ah, there he is.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.323
-You get your ass out here!
-Hey, he said he was 18.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.926
He looks like he's four,
you fucking moron! Sorry.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.928
-He consented!
-He's lying.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.696
-Harold, come on!
-RAY: Course he's lying!

31:37.829 --> 31:39.999
You can't have consent!
He's nine years old!

31:40.132 --> 31:41.633
Dad, let's go.
You're embarrassing me.

31:41.767 --> 31:42.701
We're not going anywhere, okay?

31:42.834 --> 31:43.802
He's just a little kid!

31:43.936 --> 31:45.004
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

31:45.137 --> 31:46.605
Uh, he was roaming around
in the woods.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.174
He wanted a tattoo.
W-Where were you?

31:48.307 --> 31:49.942
I was at fucking work!

31:50.076 --> 31:51.177
-Fuck you! -Hey!
-Come out here!

31:51.310 --> 31:52.511
If I was you,
I'd shut your fucking mouth,

31:52.644 --> 31:53.712
because I can
call the cops right now

31:53.845 --> 31:54.913
and have your ass
thrown in jail.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.715
-For what? -For sticking
needles in a kid's arm,

31:56.848 --> 31:57.950
you fucking dope!

31:58.084 --> 31:59.952
Did you even raise him?
Did you even raise him?

32:00.086 --> 32:02.021
You know, there's no reason
to call the cops.

32:02.154 --> 32:05.057
I can handle this and I can
also handle disciplining him.

32:05.191 --> 32:07.193
Well, clearly you can't or you
wouldn't have a middle-aged son

32:07.326 --> 32:10.396
still living at home, tattooing
minors against their will!

32:10.529 --> 32:12.164
I asked him to do it.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.966
-It's not his fault.
-That's right. That's my man.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.235
Go wait in the car.
Harold, go on.

32:16.368 --> 32:17.469
-(sighs) -And don't raise
your voice at me, either.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.837
Later, Harold.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.806
Don't say goodbye to my kid.
Look both ways.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.574
-Look both ways!
-Go to your room.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.010
-I am!
-Watch your mouth.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.412
For your information,
I am not a middle-aged man.

32:26.545 --> 32:29.081
I'm a 24-year-old man,
and I'm going to my room

32:29.215 --> 32:30.849
'cause I fucking want to.

32:30.983 --> 32:34.220
What kind of fucking animal are
you raising in this house, huh?

32:34.353 --> 32:35.587
I'm bringing you the bill.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.056
I don't care what it costs,
all right?

32:37.189 --> 32:39.391
-I mean, what the fuck is going
on around here? -All right.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.027
Just give me a day
to arrange the laser.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.661
All right.
You know, you know something?

32:42.794 --> 32:44.030
I-Is his father home?
Where's his dad?

32:44.163 --> 32:45.664
I-I don't, I don't want
to fucking yell at you.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.733
He's deceased.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.669
Oh.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.204
Well, uh...
(clears throat)

32:52.338 --> 32:53.905
I'm, uh, sorry for your loss.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.274
I'm sure if he was still around,

32:55.407 --> 32:56.675
he would agree with
the fact that,

32:56.808 --> 32:59.211
you know, you should
still pay for it.

33:02.148 --> 33:04.150
(woman humming a tune)

33:06.918 --> 33:08.020
Comically huge mustache.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.022
Is this what he looked like?

33:10.156 --> 33:11.223
That's exactly
what he looked like.

33:11.357 --> 33:13.292
-You're scared of me. (laughs)
-Yeah.

33:13.425 --> 33:14.693
Yo, he-he--
And that's not funny.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.428
He burst into the door,
started screaming,

33:16.562 --> 33:18.430
and his mustache was
flapping all over the place.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.432
-(laughs): Flapping.
-He looked the Monopoly Man.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.601
It was terrifying.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.536
-(mocking): "Look both ways!
-(laughing)

33:24.670 --> 33:26.438
Look both ways!"

33:26.572 --> 33:28.240
-Fucking maniac.
-But I will say,

33:28.374 --> 33:31.643
probably not a good idea to
tattoo children in the woods.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.479
-Yeah, probably. -You know,
you could get in trouble.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.147
-Yeah, you could.
-Why did you do that?

33:35.281 --> 33:36.282
-I don't know.
-(chuckles)

33:36.415 --> 33:37.616
I thought I would
get away with it.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.218
Plus, I thought he was, like,
at least 15, you know?

33:39.351 --> 33:40.752
-Oh, really? -I got--
Yeah, I got my first tattoo...

33:40.886 --> 33:43.222
-How old was he?
-Nine.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.723
(chuckles):
You thought he was 15?

33:44.856 --> 33:46.592
-Yeah, I'm fucking... -Maybe
you've been smoking too much.

33:46.725 --> 33:47.926
I think I'm just stupid.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.296
-(laughing)
-Uh...

33:50.429 --> 33:51.630
No, you should see
my mom, though.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.632
-It's so weird
since my sister left. -Yeah.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.334
She's just crying
all the time and, like,

33:55.467 --> 33:57.303
-she's trying to talk to me
and hang out with me. -Mm.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.071
The other day, she asked me
to go to Nordstrom Rack.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.939
-I almost slit my throat.
-(laughs)

34:01.073 --> 34:01.973
Did you go?

34:02.108 --> 34:03.609
No. I pretended to be asleep.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.444
Oh, come on, she--
Maybe she needs company.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.313
She's lonely
without your sister.

34:07.446 --> 34:10.081
Yeah, she's-she's,
she's gonna be lonely.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.351
I mean, you should've seen her
at my sister's send-off party.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.485
It was, it was really weird.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.123
There was a party?
(laughs)

34:18.257 --> 34:19.190
Yeah.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.759
Why wasn't I invited?

34:20.891 --> 34:22.994
To a high school
graduation party?

34:23.129 --> 34:25.030
Well, who was there?

34:25.164 --> 34:27.032
(sighs):
It was, you know, it was just

34:27.166 --> 34:29.935
family and... shit.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.870
What, you don't want me
to be around your family?

34:32.003 --> 34:33.472
I've known them since I was ten.

34:33.605 --> 34:34.873
Well, yeah, I just--

34:35.005 --> 34:36.675
I didn't think it was something
you would want to go to.

34:36.808 --> 34:37.842
I'm-I'm sorry.

34:37.976 --> 34:39.844
Come on, that's fucked up.

34:39.978 --> 34:41.780
Why? Why is that fucked up?

34:41.913 --> 34:45.717
Because we're, you know,
doing something here.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.152
We're-- Are-are we
doing something here?

34:47.286 --> 34:48.487
I don't know,
we're starting a thing.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.222
I mean, we're having sex
and we're hanging out a lot.

34:50.356 --> 34:52.224
-I mean, it's...
-I thought it was just, like,

34:52.358 --> 34:55.293
more, you know,
casual than that.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.628
You know?

35:00.332 --> 35:03.369
Well, you don't want me to go
to any, like, life events?

35:03.502 --> 35:06.238
Life-- What's a life event?

35:06.372 --> 35:08.374
What does that,
what does that even mean?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.677
You know what? It's fine.

35:11.810 --> 35:12.811
-What?
-No, it's fine.

35:12.944 --> 35:13.979
Come back.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.714
I'm sor-- Wait.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.716
-(Kelsey groans)
-Wai...

35:17.849 --> 35:19.318
-You know what? You're right.
-What?

35:19.451 --> 35:21.019
What are you talking about?
I'm never right.

35:21.153 --> 35:22.888
No, you're right.
We shouldn't do this anymore.

35:23.021 --> 35:24.756
I don't want
to fucking do this anymore.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.358
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.194
It was all a mistake.
It was a mistake.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.695
But it's fine.
We're on the same page.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.230
We'll go back
to what it was before.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.232
I'll treat you like I do
Oscar and Richie.

35:33.365 --> 35:34.500
I-It's not even that.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.001
It's just, like,
I-I don't know what I want yet.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.336
Like, I'm trying
to figure my shit out.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.238
And you should. Please do.
Figure your shit out.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.072
But we're not gonna
have sex anymore, okay?

35:41.207 --> 35:42.641
I got to go.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.745
I should've invited you
to the party!

35:46.878 --> 35:48.680
I didn't know
it was a life event!

35:49.681 --> 35:51.217
Oh. Oh.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.552
I-I already arranged to, uh,
pay directly at the hospital.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.721
But if you want a check,
just give me two minutes, okay?

35:55.854 --> 35:57.723
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm-I'm-- I-I want to pay.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.691
I'm gonna pay for it.
I'm gonna pay for it.

35:59.825 --> 36:00.926
No, no, no.
I'm gonna pay for it.

36:01.059 --> 36:02.461
And I'm, and I'm also
gonna talk to Scott

36:02.594 --> 36:04.863
because that was totally
out of line, totally nuts.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.565
Yeah, I-I understand that.

36:06.698 --> 36:09.801
But, uh, look, I just wanted
to apologize, okay?

36:09.935 --> 36:12.438
I-I got a little
out of control before, uh...

36:12.571 --> 36:15.741
You know, I just, I let
my anger get the best of me.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.076
Broke my stupid resolution.
(sighs)

36:18.210 --> 36:19.911
God knows it's what
messed up my marriage,

36:20.045 --> 36:21.947
and I-I just really wanted
to apologize, okay?

36:22.080 --> 36:23.449
I mean, I was upset,

36:23.582 --> 36:25.717
but I-I shouldn't have
conveyed it that way.

36:25.851 --> 36:26.918
There's no need to apologize.

36:27.052 --> 36:28.654
My kid's being a fucking
lunatic. It's not cool.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.323
Oh, I... I overreacted.
He's fine.

36:31.457 --> 36:33.292
No, it's the tip of the iceberg.

36:33.425 --> 36:36.295
Ah, you know, lot of kids
do stuff like this.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.929
Mm, kids don't do
stuff like this.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.231
He did the second-worst thing

36:39.365 --> 36:40.899
you could do
to a kid in the woods.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.001
(laughs)

36:43.134 --> 36:46.838
Well, either way, I shouldn't
have behaved the way I behaved.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.607
So, I'm truly sorry.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.277
Apology accepted.
It's nice.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.144
Don't get many of those
around here.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.980
-Thanks.
-Oh, hey, this might seem

36:55.113 --> 36:56.982
a little crazy, but, uh...

36:57.115 --> 36:59.518
can I take you out
for a cup of coffee?

36:59.651 --> 37:03.021
MARGIE:
So, Scott did this.

37:03.154 --> 37:05.257
RAY:
Oh. Is that a cocker spaniel?

37:05.391 --> 37:07.926
No. No, that's my daughter.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.027
-That's Claire.
-Oh.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.296
Oh, yeah, yeah. I can...

37:10.429 --> 37:11.497
-Yeah, I just thought...
-No, it's okay.

37:11.630 --> 37:12.864
-I thought those were ears.
-Um, it's okay.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.266
-That's her hair. Okay, yep.
-I know. I hear that.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.503
Scott got his first tattoo
when he was 16.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.371
-Oh, okay.
-It was of Kermit the Frog.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.307
Oh. (laughs)

37:21.440 --> 37:23.842
-That's kind of cute.
-Yeah, yeah.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.445
Kermit smoking a joint, so...

37:26.578 --> 37:28.280
Kermit smoking a joint?

37:28.414 --> 37:29.548
Geez, I don't remember
that episode

37:29.681 --> 37:30.716
on Sesame Street, huh?

37:30.849 --> 37:32.150
(laughs)

37:32.284 --> 37:33.852
That's kind of funny.
He's a funny kid, then, huh?

37:33.985 --> 37:35.387
-Oh, he's so funny.
-Yeah?

37:35.521 --> 37:37.155
-He's so funny. -You think
he's gonna stick it out?

37:37.289 --> 37:39.157
Uh, well, that I don't know.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.026
I mean, I sent him
to art school, but he quit.

37:41.159 --> 37:44.129
-He-he couldn't really focus
'cause... -Oh.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.733
He also has ADD, so he...

37:47.866 --> 37:50.636
Anyway, he's a tattoo artist
with ADD.

37:50.769 --> 37:51.903
(chuckles)
Well, you know what?

37:52.037 --> 37:53.372
All the guys
down at the firehouse,

37:53.505 --> 37:55.073
they all have tattoos
and stuff, you know.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.175
Personally, I never got one,
though, you know.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.910
You know, not that I have
anything against them.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.279
I just, I just always felt
I was too pasty.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.317
-So, the firehouse, huh?
-Yeah.

38:05.451 --> 38:06.718
The old firehouse.

38:06.852 --> 38:09.254
-Mm-hmm, the old firehouse.
-Yeah.

38:09.388 --> 38:11.056
So, you're a ladder or engine?

38:12.123 --> 38:13.058
Ladder.

38:13.191 --> 38:14.826
Knew it.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.062
You got firefighters
in your family?

38:17.195 --> 38:18.897
Yeah, my husband.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.499
-Oh, geez. Sorry.
-Yeah.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.833
Forgot.

38:23.669 --> 38:26.772
Hey, uh, I hope this isn't
too forward, but do you mind

38:26.905 --> 38:30.208
if-if I ask what happened
to your husband?

38:30.342 --> 38:32.110
Oh, it was a hotel fire.

38:32.243 --> 38:33.779
The roof collapsed.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.581
He went in to save somebody.

38:35.714 --> 38:39.685
They told him it wasn't safe,
but, you know, he was like that.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.288
-Wait, Stan Carlin
was your husband? -Mm-hmm.

38:43.422 --> 38:44.556
-Paramount Hotel fire?
-Yeah, yeah.

38:44.690 --> 38:45.857
Did you know him?

38:45.991 --> 38:47.426
-You, you-- Or you heard...
-No, no, no, I...

38:47.559 --> 38:48.894
Hung out with him or...?

38:49.027 --> 38:50.362
No, I j--
I just heard about him.

38:50.496 --> 38:51.697
-Oh.
-He was a real brave guy.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.098
-Yeah.
-He was kind of a,

38:53.231 --> 38:54.900
kind of a legend,
to be honest with you.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.636
-(chuckles)
-Yeah. Yeah.

38:57.769 --> 39:00.372
And Scott was only seven
when it happened, so...

39:00.506 --> 39:02.708
-Oh, that's tough.
-A lot of consequences.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.043
-Yeah, that's a tough
situation, but... -Yeah.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.979
But I-I got to tell you,
you did a great job, you know?

39:08.113 --> 39:09.314
-See, I mean, I...
-(chuckles)

39:09.448 --> 39:11.082
I know we had a little bit
of a difference there,

39:11.216 --> 39:12.651
-but, I mean, he's a good kid.
-Uh-huh.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.653
And I got to tell you, if-if
the worst he's doing is-is,

39:14.786 --> 39:16.555
you know, a couple
unlawful tattoos,

39:16.688 --> 39:18.557
-you-you did a hell of a job.
-(chuckles): Yeah.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.159
Yeah, I don't think that's
the worst he's doing, though.

39:21.292 --> 39:22.928
-Oh.
-(both laugh)

39:23.061 --> 39:24.430
-Yeah.
-Well, I don't know.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.632
You know, uh, that's
how kids are, you know?

39:28.033 --> 39:30.168
Everybody gets it
at a different time.

39:30.301 --> 39:31.803
Anyways, what are you, uh--

39:31.937 --> 39:33.439
I-I'm just sitting here,
doing all the talking here.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.441
What do you, what do you do?

39:35.574 --> 39:36.908
I'm a nurse.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.410
I'm a school nurse.
(clears throat)

39:38.544 --> 39:40.679
I'm also an ER nurse.

39:40.812 --> 39:42.914
-You work in the ER?
-Mm-hmm.

39:43.048 --> 39:46.084
Jesus Christ, Margie,
we probably met each other.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.118
Could be.

39:47.252 --> 39:48.520
So, how you doing?

39:48.654 --> 39:50.255
I'm...

39:50.388 --> 39:52.290
very tired.

39:52.424 --> 39:53.792
Really?
Well, you don't look tired.

39:53.925 --> 39:54.993
(Margie laughs)

39:55.126 --> 39:56.428
No, seriously, you look great.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.664
-Really?
-Yeah.

39:58.797 --> 40:01.967
I just don't, like-- I mean,
are you flirting with me or...?

40:02.100 --> 40:04.335
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

40:04.470 --> 40:05.804
Yeah, a lot. This is,
this is what it looks like.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.806
It is really subtle.
I couldn't--

40:07.939 --> 40:09.140
(laughing):
I can't tell what's going on.

40:09.274 --> 40:10.509
This is how it looks.
I'm very subtle.

40:10.642 --> 40:11.577
All right.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.144
-I'm rusty. You're subtle.
-Okay.

40:13.278 --> 40:14.279
-Yeah, yeah.
-Nice to meet you.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.515
(both laugh)

40:16.648 --> 40:18.617
JOE: I see you out there, man.
You're doing great.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.118
Keep-- Just keep doing
what you're doing.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.520
Have a good time, you know?

40:21.653 --> 40:24.022
The more fun you have,
the more fun the customers have.

40:24.155 --> 40:25.557
All right, thanks.

40:25.691 --> 40:27.726
("Can't Understand"
by Johnny Amoroso playing)

40:27.859 --> 40:29.995
Hey, busboy,
why is table 12 still dirty?

40:30.128 --> 40:31.497
Oh, 'cause they were talking.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.565
I didn't think I should
interrupt them, but...

40:33.699 --> 40:35.200
Interrupt them.
Get them out of here.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.468
-All right.
-Do your job.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.737
-Sorry. Whoa.
-Take it easy there, brother.

40:38.870 --> 40:41.072
-My bad. -Jesus.
-Thank you.

40:41.206 --> 40:44.209
Uh, hi. Uh, are you done
enjoying your meal?

40:44.342 --> 40:46.211
There is food in my mouth,
and I am chewing.

40:46.344 --> 40:47.879
Do you think that I'm finished?

40:48.013 --> 40:49.515
I'm just holding this
for my health?

40:49.648 --> 40:50.982
-Get me some water.
-Sorry.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.051
-Hey, come here. Come here.
Can we order? -Uh, yeah.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.586
-I'll go get your waiter.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.987
We don't have time for that.
We're in a hurry.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.022
WOMAN:
I'm starving.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.423
MAN:
Okay. Can I go?

40:58.557 --> 40:59.858
WOMAN: Usually, the woman
goes first, but go ahead.

40:59.991 --> 41:00.959
-No, no, no, no.
-Oh, yeah?

41:01.092 --> 41:02.193
-How about I'm paying?
-All right.

41:02.327 --> 41:05.196
Can I have a chicken parm
with meat sauce?

41:05.330 --> 41:06.698
No marinara.

41:06.832 --> 41:09.267
Thin. Thin chicken parm.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.702
Why aren't you writing it down?

41:10.836 --> 41:13.605
Yeah, I-I can't actually
because, uh, I'm not a waiter.

41:13.739 --> 41:16.174
I'm just a busboy, so
they don't even give me a pen.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.176
Memorize it. Yeah.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.778
Seafood pasta.
That's what I want.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.780
No clams, okay?
Double up on the shrimp.

41:21.913 --> 41:24.215
That's how I always get it.
We come here all the time.

41:24.349 --> 41:26.552
I'm not gonna remember
a word you guys just said.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.019
It's not rocket science.
Just go.

-JOE: All right, fight night!

41:39.497 --> 41:40.866
Tournament of champions!

41:40.999 --> 41:42.367
Fighting for tips.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.602
Who's going?
Who's going first?

41:43.735 --> 41:45.804
-I, Zoots.
-Zoots.

41:45.937 --> 41:48.139
-Everyone fights for their tips.
-The tips that we earn?

41:48.273 --> 41:51.643
Y-Yeah, but you have
to fight for them now.

41:51.777 --> 41:53.444

41:53.579 --> 41:55.246
-Huh? -Who got it?!
-It's you, bro.

41:55.380 --> 41:57.082
-No way. No, no way.
-Put the gloves on.

41:57.215 --> 41:58.884
Get in there. Get in there.
Hit him.

I don't want-- Please, I don--
I-I don't want to do this.

-Let's just not do this.
-You don't want to do this?

42:04.556 --> 42:05.924
-What do you mean? -No, well,
'cause we're friends, right?

42:06.057 --> 42:07.726
Yeah, no, for the next
15 seconds,

42:07.859 --> 42:09.160
this friendship is over, son.

42:09.294 --> 42:10.395
-Understand that?
-What?

42:10.528 --> 42:11.563
-Hmm?
-What?

42:11.697 --> 42:13.064
Got to understand,
fighting is serious.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.499
-I don't like it.
-It's sacred.

42:14.633 --> 42:16.167
It's how I tribute
my Lord and Savior.

42:16.301 --> 42:17.603
-What?
-It's the way I tribute

42:17.736 --> 42:18.704
my Lord and Savior, Jesus.

42:18.837 --> 42:19.905
I don't think
Jesus would want you

42:20.038 --> 42:21.039
to kick my ass right now.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.273
He would want me
to have these tips.

42:22.407 --> 42:23.308
-That's what he means.
-You can have the tips.

42:23.441 --> 42:24.309
I don't even want 'em.

42:24.442 --> 42:25.443
-What is this?
-I don't know.

42:25.577 --> 42:26.678
What's this shit?

42:26.812 --> 42:28.046
I've seen Creed a f--
a couple times.

42:28.179 --> 42:29.748
-What'd you do?
-I seen Creed a couple times.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.583
-Oh. -Are we about to do
the Cotton Eye Joe?

42:31.717 --> 42:32.651
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

42:32.784 --> 42:34.185
-Come on, son.
-Okay.

42:34.319 --> 42:35.386
-Yeah. Okay. -Come on, son.
Oh, that's right.

42:35.520 --> 42:36.655
You gonna come this way?
Come this way, boy.

42:36.788 --> 42:38.023
-Okay. -Come on.
Go ahead, take your shot, boy.

-Take that shit. Yeah!
-(groaning)

that's what friends are for.

Mm. Let me just...

this sweater off. -Okay.

this light.

43:12.991 --> 43:14.793
Let me turn it off.

-Okay.
-Okay.

43:19.765 --> 43:20.899
Just one-one second.

turn off this light.

43:23.501 --> 43:26.137
Got a lot of lamps, huh?

43:26.271 --> 43:27.739

44:38.076 --> 44:40.311
Uh, uh, I'm seeing a man.

44:40.445 --> 44:43.548
Well, I-I've been dating
someone for a little while now.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.116
You're dating someone?

44:45.250 --> 44:46.885
That-That's awesome.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.821
Like, w-why are you dating him
secretly, you little slut?

44:49.955 --> 44:51.222
W-Why didn't you tell me?

44:51.356 --> 44:53.624
Is he, like,
really, really old or...

44:53.759 --> 44:54.993
or is he really, really young?

44:55.126 --> 44:56.427
Is it one of my friends?
Is it Igor?

No, no, no. I just, I...

unless it was really serious.

Bother? You're my mom.

45:04.602 --> 45:05.837
I hope you're getting
banged out real good.

Uh, it's, um...

45:10.408 --> 45:12.010
It's Ray.

45:12.143 --> 45:14.079
Who's Ray?

45:14.212 --> 45:16.081
Remember the kid you tattooed?

45:16.214 --> 45:17.648
His father.

45:17.783 --> 45:20.118
-That fucking prick?
-Yeah, I know.

45:20.251 --> 45:23.021
He's a really nice man,
and he's really good to me.

-And he's a fireman.
-He's a fireman?!

45:26.091 --> 45:27.025

anyone in 17 years since Dad,

is a fireman?

that's a little fucking weird?

and he has the same job as Dad,
like... (stammers)

45:41.639 --> 45:44.275
I'm fucked up as it is, Mom.
Like, I have Crohn's, okay?

45:44.409 --> 45:46.044
There's something wrong
up here. Huh.

45:46.177 --> 45:47.813
I can't find my watch!

45:47.946 --> 45:49.214
What are you trying
to do to me here?!

45:49.347 --> 45:50.381
Haven't I been through enough?!

45:50.515 --> 45:51.716
Wait, what did I,
what did I do wrong?

45:51.850 --> 45:53.051
W-What did I do wrong?
What did I do?

45:53.184 --> 45:55.053
What-- I'm sorry.
Like, what did I do?

45:55.186 --> 45:56.855
(stammers) I'm not,
I'm not doing it to you.

45:56.988 --> 45:58.990
I just-- I-I don't want to be
alone the rest of my life.

45:59.124 --> 46:00.558
I don't want you
to be alone, either.

46:00.691 --> 46:02.493
That would suck, but, like,
come on. This is, like--

46:02.627 --> 46:04.830
This is pretty obvious this is
not a good choice, right?

46:04.963 --> 46:06.664
(sighs)

46:06.798 --> 46:09.000
I would like us to have dinner.

46:09.134 --> 46:11.169
I-- This is
very, very important to me.

46:11.302 --> 46:12.603
I am in a serious
relationship...

46:12.737 --> 46:14.672
-You're in a serious rela...
-...with a very nice man.

46:14.806 --> 46:16.474
With that guy?! Come on!

46:16.607 --> 46:18.076
Y-You don't love him, do you?

46:18.209 --> 46:19.845
You're not say-- You're not,
like, saying that, right?

46:19.978 --> 46:21.880
I-I-- Well, we don't use
that word yet.

46:22.013 --> 46:24.515
But if he said it to me,
I-I would say it back.

46:24.649 --> 46:27.218
Oh, my God! Jesus!

46:27.352 --> 46:29.087
Do you not learn?!

46:29.220 --> 46:31.489
Look what happened last time!

46:31.622 --> 46:32.924
-You want to do that again?
-Okay. All right?

46:33.058 --> 46:34.025
How about this?

46:34.159 --> 46:35.861
How about we come by
the restaurant

46:35.994 --> 46:37.428
and we have dinner
when you're working

46:37.562 --> 46:39.097
and you just come by
and you just say hi?

46:39.230 --> 46:41.266
Just say hi a couple times.
How about that?

46:41.399 --> 46:42.600
How about that?

46:42.733 --> 46:45.070
How about--
Why don't you ask him?

46:45.203 --> 46:46.171
Huh?

46:46.304 --> 46:47.705
Why don't you just build

46:47.839 --> 46:49.407
another shrine to Ray
while you're at it?

46:49.540 --> 46:52.743
Right across from Dad's
so they can be fucking pals!

46:54.512 --> 46:55.580
Yeah, I like that better.

46:55.713 --> 46:56.848
But I'm actually
finding you funny

46:56.982 --> 46:58.116
'cause you're really funny.

46:58.249 --> 46:59.250
-(Margie laughs)
-(jazz music playing)

46:59.384 --> 47:00.718
Look at this guy.

47:00.852 --> 47:03.354
-Having the time of his life.
-ZOOTS: Mm-hmm.

47:03.488 --> 47:04.890
Acting like he owns the place.

47:05.023 --> 47:07.959
I know that guy.
Eggplant parmesan.

47:08.093 --> 47:09.727
(chuckles):
Oh. I'll be.

47:09.861 --> 47:12.030
Your moms is a bit of a baddie.

47:12.163 --> 47:13.531
She look postcoital.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.433
-What's "postcoital"?
-It's like post-fucking,

47:15.566 --> 47:17.268
but it's your mom,
so I want to be nice.

47:17.402 --> 47:19.737
But, uh, (chuckles)
oh, it's definitely happening.

47:20.771 --> 47:22.773
(exhales slowly)

47:24.542 --> 47:26.411
Postcoital.

47:26.544 --> 47:27.812
-(laughing)
-If you ever come to see me,

47:27.946 --> 47:29.280
if you ever come
see me, that's--

47:29.414 --> 47:30.715
-It'll happen that night,
I guarantee it. -Yeah, I know.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.150
Oh, here he is.

47:32.283 --> 47:33.418
-Hey.
-Hey.

47:33.551 --> 47:34.585
-How you doing?
-Good. How are you?

47:34.719 --> 47:35.987
Good to see you again. Yeah.

47:36.121 --> 47:38.256
Uh, I'm-I'm really sorry
for branding your kid.

47:38.389 --> 47:40.658
Oh, no, no, no.
It's-it's fine. It's fine.

47:40.791 --> 47:42.793
Cost 350, but I didn't make
your mom pay for it.

47:42.928 --> 47:44.295
(Ray laughs)

47:44.429 --> 47:46.431
But, uh, hey, no harm, no foul.

47:46.564 --> 47:49.767
You know? 'Cause, uh,
if that didn't happen, I, uh...

47:49.901 --> 47:51.436
wouldn't have met
this lovely lady.

47:51.569 --> 47:53.271
Oh, well, happy to help.

47:53.404 --> 47:54.672
Things work out.

47:54.805 --> 47:55.907
Yeah.

47:56.041 --> 47:58.309
Thank God I did
what I did, then.

47:58.443 --> 48:00.678
Uh, would you guys like
to start with still

48:00.811 --> 48:01.846
or, uh, sparkling water?

48:01.980 --> 48:03.481
-Oh, let's go sparkling.
-Uh, spar-- Yeah.

48:03.614 --> 48:04.749
-(stammers, laughs)
-Yeah? You like sparkling?

48:04.882 --> 48:05.984
-Yeah.
-Okay.

48:06.117 --> 48:07.185
Yeah. Oh, can we get
some more bread, too?

48:07.318 --> 48:08.286
-Usually go still.
-You know?

48:08.419 --> 48:09.754
Last time I came here,
it came out hot.

48:09.887 --> 48:11.522
-Yeah.
-It was-- oh, it was perfect.

48:11.656 --> 48:12.857
It's like my mom made it.
(chuckles)

48:12.991 --> 48:13.858
Sure.

48:13.992 --> 48:15.293
Sparkling and hot bread.

48:15.426 --> 48:16.995
All right. Thanks, buddy.

48:21.066 --> 48:22.968
Oh, you just can't spit
on that like that, man.

48:23.101 --> 48:25.470
You got to be crafty.
You can't just go out at, like--

48:25.603 --> 48:26.837
You got to,
you got to maneuver.

48:26.972 --> 48:29.140
Lick on it or put a boogie
in it or something.

48:29.274 --> 48:31.309
You think I can fit
this whole thing in my ass?

48:31.442 --> 48:33.311
If, uh, you really
put your mind to it, bro.

48:37.348 --> 48:39.484
Hey, I saw him spit
in the bread.

48:42.453 --> 48:44.322
All right, scorching hot bread.

48:44.455 --> 48:45.957
-RAY: Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

48:46.091 --> 48:47.792
Your mom's in the john.
Have a seat.

48:47.925 --> 48:50.328
Oh, don't worry, you're not
gonna get in trouble.

48:50.461 --> 48:51.862
Just for a minute.

48:51.997 --> 48:53.431
All right.

48:55.633 --> 48:59.237
So... how, uh, how you liking
the job here?

48:59.370 --> 49:01.872
Uh, it eats ass.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.243
You know, I remember I--
Back in the day,

49:05.376 --> 49:07.145
I used to work at that, uh,
you know that pizza parlor

49:07.278 --> 49:08.613
-down there on Main Street?
-Mm.

49:08.746 --> 49:10.515
You remember the one? Yeah.
I-I used to work down there.

49:10.648 --> 49:13.218
I loved it.
You know, making the pizzas.

49:13.351 --> 49:14.885
Girls would come in, you know.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.222
It's like they just
had to talk to me.

49:17.355 --> 49:18.223
Yeah.

49:18.356 --> 49:19.757
Well, that's awesome.

49:19.890 --> 49:22.994
I'm glad you got laid a lot
at your pizza place.

49:25.230 --> 49:27.265
All right. (sighs)
Listen, Scott.

49:27.398 --> 49:30.068
I-I know this is weird, okay?

49:30.201 --> 49:32.703
You and your mom were alone
together for a long time.

49:32.837 --> 49:35.173
You got set in your ways,
you know?

49:35.306 --> 49:37.208
You got used to things.

49:37.342 --> 49:38.676
But I don't know,
I just feel like

49:38.809 --> 49:40.511
your mother deserves
more right now.

49:40.645 --> 49:43.514
And I'm serious, I really think
that I can make her happy,

49:43.648 --> 49:45.716
and she makes me happy.

49:45.850 --> 49:48.286
So, I mean, that-that's
a good thing, right?

49:48.419 --> 49:50.688
Yeah. Yeah, I think
it's a great thing.

49:50.821 --> 49:53.624
I... I want my mom to be happy
more than anything, so...

49:53.758 --> 49:55.193
Good. I do, too.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.462
So, uh, what's your sport?

49:57.595 --> 49:59.564
-Uh, I like basketball.
-Oh, yeah?

49:59.697 --> 50:00.565
-Mm-hmm.
-What position?

50:00.698 --> 50:01.799
Uh, I played small forward.

50:01.932 --> 50:03.068
-Small forward.
-Yeah.

50:03.201 --> 50:04.702
All right. I'm kind of
a baseball guy myself.

50:04.835 --> 50:06.037
-Oh, yeah?
-You like, uh...

50:06.171 --> 50:07.305
I'm an old man.
I like that stuff.

50:07.438 --> 50:08.706
I got season tickets
to the Yankees.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.408
-No way. Really? That's cool.
-Yeah.

50:10.541 --> 50:11.642
I think it's
Staten Island's year.

50:11.776 --> 50:13.578
Oh, Staten Island Yankees.

50:13.711 --> 50:15.946
-Minor League.
-Oh, absolutely.

50:16.081 --> 50:18.449
I'm not gonna go pay to see
those overpaid crybabies.

50:18.583 --> 50:20.551
They try harder
at the Minor League level.

50:20.685 --> 50:22.287
Plus, I'm a Red Sox fan.
I'm never setting foot

50:22.420 --> 50:23.888
-in that stadium.
-Well, I-I should get back

50:24.021 --> 50:25.723
to work, uh,
before I get yelled at.

50:25.856 --> 50:26.957
-Okay. Go ahead.
-So, yeah.

50:27.092 --> 50:28.426
-Absolutely. All right.
-All right, man.

50:28.559 --> 50:30.428
Uh, enjoy the hot bread.

50:30.561 --> 50:31.429
-MARGIE: Hey.
-Okay, cool.

50:31.562 --> 50:32.463
Hey.

50:32.597 --> 50:34.065
What are you fellas
talking about?

50:34.199 --> 50:35.900
-Hey, Mom.
-Oh, I was just asking Scott

50:36.033 --> 50:38.103
if he wanted to go
to a Yankee game sometime.

50:38.236 --> 50:40.105
Oh, what did Scott say?

50:41.139 --> 50:44.842
S-Scott... Scott said yeah.

50:44.975 --> 50:46.644
SCOTT: All right,
who's fighting tonight?!

50:46.777 --> 50:48.413
I want to fight somebody!

50:48.546 --> 50:49.847
Oh, I'm sorry, Pepe.

Don't take this personally.

-MAN: Oh!

50:54.919 --> 50:56.654
What happened?

50:56.787 --> 50:58.689
That was just a jab.

50:58.823 --> 51:00.158
Oh, it's okay, Pepe.

51:00.291 --> 51:01.659
-It's all right.
-You s-- You sure?

51:01.792 --> 51:02.893
(groans) Yeah.

51:03.027 --> 51:05.196
I-I mean, I never done that
before, so...

51:05.330 --> 51:07.298
I feel bad for you.

send these guys

you ever think about
putting on the jacket?

53:09.920 --> 53:11.188
if they want to be an astronaut?

Whoa, I don't think that lady
had any kids, though.

53:26.571 --> 53:28.439
-No. I want to hear it.
-You don't got to do this, man.

53:28.573 --> 53:29.807
-Come on.
-All right, no.

53:29.940 --> 53:31.309
-Yeah. Okay, how about this?
-Come on, you don't...

53:31.442 --> 53:33.143
Uh, if you're a fireman,
just don't have kids

53:33.278 --> 53:34.579
or a family at all, okay?

53:34.712 --> 53:36.414
So that way, you don't
fucking crush them

53:36.547 --> 53:39.149
when you don't come home
that one time, you know?

53:39.284 --> 53:40.618
And-and you're just so selfish.

53:40.751 --> 53:42.253
You just hang out
with your boys all day

53:42.387 --> 53:43.688
like it's a fucking frat house.

53:43.821 --> 53:45.990
Half the time, you're not even
putting out fires.

53:46.123 --> 53:49.093
You're just jerking off,
watching Scarface, okay?

53:49.226 --> 53:51.095
-All right, take it easy, man.
-No, I'm just saying.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.997
And it's wrong to tell a kid
that you're gonna be there

53:53.130 --> 53:54.399
for him for his whole
entire life.

53:54.532 --> 53:57.302
Yeah, but you miss graduation,
your birthdays, okay?

53:57.435 --> 53:58.869
Uh, my d-- my prom dances.

53:59.003 --> 54:01.672
That's a very mean thing
to do to children.

54:01.806 --> 54:02.873
And, uh, if you have a family,

54:03.007 --> 54:04.174
-y-you're an asshole.
-No, listen, no.

54:04.309 --> 54:05.476
Take it easy, take it easy.

54:05.610 --> 54:07.478
-Well, that's one way
to look at it. -Yeah.

54:07.612 --> 54:08.813
Tell that to my dad.

54:11.316 --> 54:15.286
Oh, but you can't,
'cause he's dead.

54:15.420 --> 54:17.488
-Anybody got a good response
to that? -(bat cracks)

54:17.622 --> 54:20.124
-(crowd cheering)
-Yeah!

54:20.257 --> 54:22.226
Again!

54:22.360 --> 54:23.328
Whoo!

54:23.461 --> 54:26.464
What a game.
What a game.

54:26.597 --> 54:28.666
So, what, I shouldn't have kids?

54:28.799 --> 54:30.535
No, you... you should have kids.

54:30.668 --> 54:31.836
I'm gonna have kids.

54:31.969 --> 54:33.371
You know, maybe
you should take a cue

54:33.504 --> 54:35.573
from your shirt, you know?
Smile.

54:35.706 --> 54:38.409
Lighten up.

54:38.543 --> 54:40.311
(chuckles)
That's actually kind of funny.

54:40.445 --> 54:41.912
Guy's all right.
Why can't you be more like him?

54:42.046 --> 54:43.348
He's all right.

54:43.481 --> 54:45.683
Why can't you not
embarrass me like this?

54:45.816 --> 54:47.418
I'm sorry.

54:47.552 --> 54:50.054
I'm sorry I embarrassed you
in front of your friends.

54:50.187 --> 54:51.689
(laughs)

54:53.724 --> 54:55.660
(quietly): And just-just
stick to your guns.

54:55.793 --> 54:57.061
All right? It'll be fine.

54:57.194 --> 54:58.228
Hey. Hey!

54:58.363 --> 54:59.263
Come on in.

54:59.397 --> 55:00.998
Come have breakfast with us.

55:01.131 --> 55:03.734
I made pancakes, and I made
the sausage that you like,

55:03.868 --> 55:04.769
an omelet.

55:04.902 --> 55:06.036
Come, come, come, come sit.

55:06.170 --> 55:08.205
RAY:
Man, these eggs are spectacular.

55:08.339 --> 55:10.341
With the onions and the peppers.

55:10.475 --> 55:13.243
I love it. I love it.
(sniffs)

55:14.745 --> 55:17.281
Did, uh, did he
sp-spend the night?

55:17.415 --> 55:18.916
MARGIE:
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

55:19.049 --> 55:20.418
He slept here.

55:20.551 --> 55:21.452
In this house.

55:21.586 --> 55:23.287
I'm an adult. I can do that.

55:23.421 --> 55:25.255
(chuckles)

55:25.390 --> 55:27.692
I-I need to talk to you
about something.

55:27.825 --> 55:29.093
Okay.

55:29.226 --> 55:30.895
I was thinking that it's time

55:31.028 --> 55:32.863
to think about
getting your own apartment.

55:32.997 --> 55:34.465
What?

55:34.599 --> 55:36.300
W-Why would you say that?

55:36.434 --> 55:38.068
Well...

55:39.904 --> 55:41.572
You are so awesome.

55:41.706 --> 55:45.576
And I think I've been there
for you too much.

55:45.710 --> 55:48.546
'Cause sometimes in life,
the thing that's motivating

55:48.679 --> 55:51.048
is when people don't have
that safety net.

55:51.181 --> 55:52.917
Right, right,
but I need that safety net

55:53.050 --> 55:54.318
'cause I don't have
my shit together.

55:54.452 --> 55:56.153
So, like, uh,
w-why are you doing this?

55:56.286 --> 55:57.555
Is this 'cause of him?

55:58.589 --> 56:00.157
No.

56:00.290 --> 56:02.960
It's just you're
24 years old now.

56:03.093 --> 56:06.764
24. I mean, Phelps had
a fistful of gold medals by 24.

56:06.897 --> 56:08.766
Why are you talking?

56:08.899 --> 56:11.235
I'm just giving you
some perspective, that's all.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.671
You know, Wayne Gretzky had,
like, 96 goals when he was 24.

56:13.804 --> 56:15.773
W-What?

56:15.906 --> 56:17.975
RAY: Roger Staubach
graduated West Point,

56:18.108 --> 56:21.245
won a Heisman Trophy,
fought in the Vietnam War,

56:21.378 --> 56:23.648
and then joined the Cowboys
by the time he was 24.

56:23.781 --> 56:26.851
I don't know who that is,
so, s-so who-who gives a fuck?

56:26.984 --> 56:29.153
I think that maybe
you're-you're ready

56:29.286 --> 56:31.155
and you just don't even know it.

56:31.288 --> 56:33.591
So, you're kicking me out?

56:33.724 --> 56:34.992
No, no.

56:35.125 --> 56:37.428
I just want you to get
your own apartment by summer.

56:37.562 --> 56:39.464
Right, so you're kicking me
out of the house.

56:39.597 --> 56:41.466
That's nine months from now.

56:41.599 --> 56:43.501
I mean, you-you could have
a baby in nine months.

56:43.634 --> 56:44.835
It's a long time.

56:44.969 --> 56:46.771
Are you moving in?
Are you trying to push me out?

56:46.904 --> 56:48.973
What, like, what did I do?
I-I thought we were cool.

56:49.106 --> 56:50.975
Scott, Scott, let's all
be adults here. Come on.

56:51.108 --> 56:53.511
Your mother has worked
very hard for a very long time.

56:53.644 --> 56:55.179
And I'm gonna retire
in a couple years,

56:55.312 --> 56:59.049
so things are gonna change
around here, but in a good way.

56:59.183 --> 57:01.486
I mean, w-we think you--
that you can do great things.

57:01.619 --> 57:02.953
Yeah, I know I'm gonna do
great things.

57:03.087 --> 57:05.523
But, like, I don't need you
to tell me that, like...

57:05.656 --> 57:06.857
This is-- What's going on?

57:06.991 --> 57:08.959
This is-- I-I...

57:09.093 --> 57:10.495
I don't like this.

57:10.628 --> 57:12.497
So, be that as it may,
(chuckles)

57:12.630 --> 57:14.499
until you leave--
which is gonna be good for you

57:14.632 --> 57:15.733
and it's gonna be motivating--

57:15.866 --> 57:17.234
you're gonna have to
pull your weight

57:17.367 --> 57:18.736
a little more around here.

57:18.869 --> 57:21.906
And one thing that we thought
would help you contribute--

57:22.039 --> 57:24.374
would be easy,
wouldn't be hard to do--

57:24.509 --> 57:27.745
is to help Ray bring his kids
back and forth to school

57:27.878 --> 57:30.748
when he can't do it
because of work.

57:30.881 --> 57:32.817
Like now.

57:32.950 --> 57:34.251
Like today.

57:34.384 --> 57:35.886
(chuckles)

57:36.020 --> 57:38.222
You're joking, right?

57:38.355 --> 57:41.058
You want me to take
your kid to school?

57:41.191 --> 57:43.093
The kid that I tattooed?

57:43.227 --> 57:46.430
I got two kids.
The other one's seven.

57:46.564 --> 57:48.232
You're gonna make me
babysit your kids?

57:48.365 --> 57:51.101
Do-- I'm on-- I do drugs.

57:51.235 --> 57:53.871
Well, looks like you're walking.

57:54.004 --> 57:55.873
And thank you.

57:56.006 --> 57:58.876
I'm not cool with
any of this, okay?

57:59.009 --> 58:00.778
And-and where do you
expect me to live?

58:00.911 --> 58:02.279
And w-with what money?
(stammers)

58:02.412 --> 58:04.114
You know I'm a fucking bum,
right?

58:04.248 --> 58:06.350
Yo, this is fucked up!
Seriously.

58:06.483 --> 58:10.487
Especially after last night,
all that bonding boy bullshit.

58:11.488 --> 58:12.523
You're full of shit, man.

58:12.657 --> 58:14.458
You're a fucking liar.

58:14.592 --> 58:17.294
I'm gonna go walk your kids.

58:17.427 --> 58:19.697
No, I'm not fucking
letting you take 'em.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.932
Fuck you.
Who the fuck are you?

58:22.066 --> 58:23.634
SCOTT: Yeah, I-I agree
with you completely.

58:23.768 --> 58:25.302
Why-- 'cause that--
It was Ray's idea.

58:25.435 --> 58:26.871
I don't think I should be
taking them, either.

58:27.004 --> 58:28.038
I agree with you.

58:30.407 --> 58:32.042
Are you a weirdo?

58:32.176 --> 58:33.443
Oh, the weirdest.

58:33.578 --> 58:35.045
Nobody's weirder than me.

58:35.179 --> 58:37.447
See, a weirdo wouldn't say that.

58:37.582 --> 58:39.416
A weirdo would deny it.

58:39.550 --> 58:42.753
So, do I have to take 'em or...?

58:42.887 --> 58:45.155
(exhales sharply)

58:45.289 --> 58:46.223
Yes.

58:46.356 --> 58:48.392
God, no.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.227
I mean, (scoffs)
Ray was supposed to do it.

58:50.360 --> 58:51.629
I can't fucking do it.

58:51.762 --> 58:53.263
Their schools start
half an hour apart

58:53.397 --> 58:54.799
on the other side of town.

58:54.932 --> 58:56.601
(Gina sighs)

58:59.069 --> 59:02.673
So, your mom is banging my ex?

59:02.807 --> 59:04.809
Yeah, I'm not thrilled
about it, either.

59:04.942 --> 59:07.477
Yeah, well, you shouldn't be.

59:07.612 --> 59:09.647
-(sighs)
-Harold. Kelly.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.181
Come here. Come here.

59:11.315 --> 59:14.184
There's something,
something kind of fun.

59:14.318 --> 59:15.620
Come here. Come here.

59:15.753 --> 59:17.421
-Oh, hey, man.
-(clears throat)

59:17.554 --> 59:20.591
So, this is Harold,
and this is Kelly.

59:20.725 --> 59:23.160
And, uh, this is...

59:24.228 --> 59:25.763
Scott.

59:25.896 --> 59:27.932
Scott. He's gonna be
taking care of you.

59:28.065 --> 59:30.134
-Okay? It...
-Nice to meet you, Scott.

59:30.267 --> 59:32.336
Hi, Harold.
It's nice to meet you.

59:32.469 --> 59:34.104
For the very first time.

59:34.238 --> 59:35.940
GINA:
If he does anything weird,

59:36.073 --> 59:37.274
you tell me.

59:37.407 --> 59:40.310
Even if he tells you
not to tell me, you tell me.

59:40.444 --> 59:44.348
I'm pretty sure he's not weird,
but I could be wrong.

59:44.481 --> 59:45.449
'Kay?

59:45.582 --> 59:46.617
-Love you.
-Okay.

59:46.751 --> 59:47.685
-Love you, Mom.
-Seriously.

59:47.818 --> 59:49.119
Love you, Mom. Bye.

59:49.253 --> 59:50.320
Pay attention.

59:50.454 --> 59:52.690
Got it.

59:52.823 --> 59:54.825
GINA:
Hold both their hands!

59:58.128 --> 01:00:00.030
Thank you.

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:02.466
Look both ways. Look both ways!

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.534
(quietly):
Tell her to stop.

01:00:04.669 --> 01:00:07.037
God!

01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:09.173
So, w-what do you like
to do, Harold?

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:11.541
I like superheroes.

01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:13.410
Well, so does everybody.

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:15.245
No, I make up my own.

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:17.081
Oh, yeah? What kind?

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:18.582
Ice Flash.

01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:20.851
What does he do?

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:25.222
He freezes stuff
and shoots ice at people.

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:28.192
Oh, well, that's not gonna work.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:29.459
Why not?

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:31.361
I could just use a hair dryer
and ruin him.

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:33.030
(stammers)
Keep thinking, though.

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:35.032
What do you got?
What do you like to do?

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:37.067
-I like to sing.
-You do?

01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:39.069
Could-could you sing for me?

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:40.537
Sure.

01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:44.341
* Oh, what a beautiful morning *

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:45.342
Yes.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:48.345
* Oh, what a beautiful day *

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:49.346
All right.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:53.884
* I've got a wonderful feeling *

01:00:54.018 --> 01:00:57.521
* Everything's going my way. *

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.223
That shit was dope.
High five.

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:00.490
She's a good singer.

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:02.727
I don't agree with
the sentiment of the song,

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.428
but it was really great.

01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:07.597
Anyway, have a great day
at school.

01:01:07.732 --> 01:01:10.200
Uh... I hope it's not shitty,

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:13.137
and, um, yeah, give your,
uh, sister a kiss goodbye.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:15.773
-We don't do that.
-Just do it.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.611
-See? Wasn't that nice?
-(school bell ringing)

01:01:21.746 --> 01:01:23.613
Now, if she dies tomorrow,
you'll remember that,

01:01:23.748 --> 01:01:24.982
that you kissed her goodbye.

01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:26.650
Have a good day at school.

01:01:26.784 --> 01:01:29.286
-Later, man.
-Pay attention.

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:31.722
-Why would I die?
-I don't know.

01:01:31.856 --> 01:01:33.290
You never know
what's gonna happen.

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:35.059
Think you're immortal?

01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:39.764
This. It's this one.

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:41.766
Okay. All right.

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:43.600
(kids chattering)

01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:45.836
Well, have a good day, okay?

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:47.471
-KELLY: Okay.
-I'll see you soon, I guess.

01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:49.639
-Can-can I help you?
-Oh, hi.

01:01:49.774 --> 01:01:51.008
I'm-I'm Ray's friend.

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:53.377
I was just here
to bring her here.

01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:57.181
-You-you know Ray?
-I know Ray a little bit.

01:01:57.314 --> 01:01:59.583
He's kind of, like,
banging my mom. (chuckles)

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.151
-(chuckles)
-So, yeah, I'm just, you know,

01:02:01.285 --> 01:02:02.186
just dropping her off.

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:04.188
Did you sign in at the office?

01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:06.290
No. I didn't even know
you had an office.

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:08.325
Okay, um...

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:09.860
Kelly? You okay?

01:02:09.994 --> 01:02:11.295
Yeah.

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:12.662
-You sure?
-Yeah.

01:02:12.797 --> 01:02:14.264
You know you can tell me.

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.133
I'm okay.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:17.534
Do you know him?

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:18.635
Yeah, kind of.

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:20.704
He's a new friend.

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:22.773
Okay.

01:02:22.907 --> 01:02:24.842
Oh, I trained her in the car.
She's not gonna break.

01:02:24.975 --> 01:02:26.176
-(chuckles nervously)
-I'm just kidding.

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.845
It's, uh...
I'm not gonna hurt her.

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:29.613
Um, but have a great day.
I just...

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:32.216
No, uh, actually, could you,
uh, set up the paints?

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:33.650
-No.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.019
-Uh, and just wash
these brushes. -No.

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:36.286
-Thank you so much.
-No. No.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.388
-Thank you!
-No.

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:40.524
(hard rock music playing)

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:46.763
(tattoo gun buzzing)

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.575
Did-did you happen
to get a chance

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:01.145
-to take a look at the, uh...
-Yeah, I looked at your book.

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:04.314
I mean, I drew like that, too,
when I was 14.

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.884
From what I saw, you don't
really have the basics,

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:08.819
so you got to figure that out.

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:10.254
Well, yeah, that's why I'm here.

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:12.589
I mean, I was hoping
I can learn from you.

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:15.025
Right, well, um,
you'd be my apprentice.

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:16.526
Uh, you'll be a slave
to the shop.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.229
-Hey, man. As long as I get
to tattoo people, right? -No.

01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:21.866
Never. Until I say.

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:24.334
Uh, you'll be sterilizing
needles, washing my car,

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:25.535
taking the trash out.

01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:27.237
I mean, you're basically
our bitch.

01:03:27.371 --> 01:03:29.039
So, how much will I be,
like, making here?

01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:31.008
-Dick.
-Dick.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.509
Okay, well...

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.912
It's a long line of people
who want this job, man.

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:37.381
How do I, like, pay my rent?

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:41.451
(exhales sharply) That one
right there is not my problem.

01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:42.953
It's your first day,
you're already complaining.

01:03:43.087 --> 01:03:44.088
It's kind of weird, huh?

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:45.890
Yeah, let's not do this.

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:48.025
You should take a walk.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:50.627
-Pussy.
-All right.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.629
Well, could I ask you
a question?

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:54.064
If I did work here?

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:55.365
Why is he still here?

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:57.201
Let's say some idiot
walks in, right?

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.203
And he wants to get a tattoo
of a Confederate flag

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:00.604
wrapped around the Grim Reaper.

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:02.372
You could tell that guy
to go fuck himself, right?

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.141
'Cause that's a ridiculous
tattoo to ask for.

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:06.743
SHOP OWNER: It's not my place
to judge people, man.

01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:08.245
I don't do that.

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:10.480
Well, what if another guy
walked in and he wanted to get

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:12.116
a tattoo of his dead friend
James on his chest, right?

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:13.884
But you know James,
and you don't want

01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:15.886
to give him the tattoo,
'cause you know James

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.154
and he's an asshole
and that the world's

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:18.388
better off without him.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:19.756
-What do you do then?
-You have a death wish?

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:20.857
No, I don't have a death wish.

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:22.792
But that lady
on the motorcycle does.

01:04:22.927 --> 01:04:24.261
She's not even wearing
any underwear.

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:25.930
-She's gonna burn her pussy.
-Do you want to do this?

01:04:26.063 --> 01:04:27.231
You really want
to fucking do this?

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:28.398
I don't want to do
anything with you.

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:29.433
I just want to know
who killed James.

01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:30.600
Was it the Confederate flag man?

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:32.269
Was it the motorcycle lady?

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:35.339
I got to be honest, Kelsey, you
look exactly like your picture.

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:37.975
You're kind of thicker,
more robust.

01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:39.476
(laughs):
Oh, thank you.

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:40.744
-Yeah.
-It's a compliment.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.780
You look a little bit like
Antonio Banderas,

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:45.082
if I squint really hard.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.350
Oh, please squint
all night long.

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:47.817
-(laughs)
-That's great.

01:04:47.952 --> 01:04:49.419
-Chelsea, you are-- I mean,
Kelsey, I'm sorry. -(laughs)

01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:50.754
-Th-That's all right.
It's only... -Yeah, you know.

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:51.788
What's your name again?

01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:52.789
-I forgot already.
-Um, it's Jake.

01:04:52.923 --> 01:04:53.790
Sorry about that.

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:54.992
So, uh, w-what do you do?

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:56.626
KELSEY: Oh, I'm studying
to work in the city.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.928
-JAKE: Oh.
-Um, I want to make

01:04:58.062 --> 01:05:00.664
Staten Island, like,
a great place again.

01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:03.467
Staten Island's already cool.
What are you talking about?

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.102
Yeah, it is. (chuckles)

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:06.937
-Yeah. Yeah, it is. -You're the
first person here to say that.

01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:08.605
JAKE:
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:09.773
It's the best place on Earth.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.608
Well, at least
on the East Coast, I think.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:12.776
Excuse me.

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.012
Oh, hey.

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:16.013
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:18.148
-Hello.
-Hey.

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.351
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:05:21.485 --> 01:05:24.488
Uh, would you guys like,
uh, still or sparkling water?

01:05:24.621 --> 01:05:27.191
Um, you pick.

01:05:27.324 --> 01:05:28.725
Uh, I'm more of a sparkling guy,

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:29.859
-so sparkling.
-Sparkling it is.

01:05:29.994 --> 01:05:31.328
But I do like tequila,
so if I could

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:33.197
get just a Patrón, you know,
with a rock.

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:35.199
-That cool with you?
-That's fine. Yeah, that's fine.

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:36.733
-Yeah? Cool. Yeah,
I prefer a tequila. -Cool.

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:38.668
Tequila and rock. You guys
want, like, warm bread or...

01:05:38.802 --> 01:05:41.305
uh, olive oil?

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:43.007
JAKE:
Warm bread.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.741
Oh.

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:47.978
-Bro, did you scare off another
customer? -(Scott sighs)

01:05:48.112 --> 01:05:49.646
What's wrong with you?

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.348
I'm so sorry about that.

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:53.850
He has, like, nepotism,
you know?

01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:55.185
Is that a disease?

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:57.354
Yeah, it's a bad one.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:58.922
I brought that guy here
to make you jealous.

01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:00.024
You could give a fuck.

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:01.758
T-To make me jea...

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:03.927
-You don't seem jealous
or upset at all. -I do care.

01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:05.362
Of course I care.

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:06.763
I chose the hottest guy
on Tinder.

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:08.165
Look at me. Look at me.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.299
Look at my tits.

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:10.700
There is literally
the Eiffel Tower--

01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:12.036
it's holding them up in here.

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:13.337
You look great. I'm...

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:14.404
Thank you.

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:15.705
Please don't cry here.
Please.

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:17.274
You look awful.

01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:18.908
What? What do you mean?
What are you...

01:06:19.043 --> 01:06:22.046
Your skin looks see-through and
the circles around your eyes

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:24.281
are so dark you look like
an anorexic panda.

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:26.250
I-- Well, I-I know.

01:06:26.383 --> 01:06:27.851
-I know I do.
-I don't know.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.220
You always look sick and pale
like you have a disease

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:32.356
but you don't know it yet,
but you literally look like

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:34.058
if I touched you,
you'd just turn to dust.

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:35.592
I'm sorry.
I-I'm not doing very well.

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:37.761
-(sighs)
-I-I'm not, you know-- I...

01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:39.629
Well, what do I tell your date?

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:41.431
I don't know.
Tell him to fuck off.

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:44.268
I met him ten minutes ago.
He's a DJ.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.905
(sighs)

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:53.577
HAROLD: Why do you not think
ice is a good superpower?

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:55.812
It's amazing. I mean...

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:58.915
Ice Flash can do anything
with his ice.

01:06:59.049 --> 01:07:00.584
And it's indestructible

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:02.119
'cause it's superhero ice.

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:05.555
He can make giant shields
that reflect anything.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:09.226
He can make giant ice tanks,

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:12.062
giant ice planes and giant jets,

01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:14.331
helicopters that shoot
giant missiles.

01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:17.301
I mean, think of
all the possibilities.

01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:19.303
SCOTT:
That's actually kind of cool.

01:07:19.436 --> 01:07:20.970
-HAROLD: Thanks.
-You came up with that?

01:07:21.105 --> 01:07:22.739
Yeah.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.841
You're getting, like,
really good at this.

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:26.076
Thanks.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:28.011
What color is his shield?

01:07:28.145 --> 01:07:30.180
It's, well, the color of ice.

01:07:30.314 --> 01:07:32.316
Well, what's the color of ice?
Is it, like, see-through?

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:35.119
Like, light blue ice
or is it like...?

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:37.187
It's blue ice 'cause it's...

01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:40.090
-it's, like, superhero ice,
and it's cool. -Right.

01:07:40.224 --> 01:07:42.092
OSCAR:
You remember that kid Ronnie?

01:07:42.226 --> 01:07:44.261
His uncle owns the pharmacy.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.663
He gave me the key.
We're gonna load up on oxys.

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.132
So, we're robbers now.
That's our future.

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:50.700
Nah. Nah, nah, nah, nah.
We're gonna do this one time.

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:52.802
Get the money
to seed our dreams.

01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:54.338
Get that venture capital.

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:56.873
Open that tattoo restaurant
you wanted.

01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:58.775
It's not that big a deal.
Jay-Z did it.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.844
He sold crack
to fund his rap career.

01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:02.879
Aren't most of Jay-Z's friends,
like, dead or in jail?

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:05.515
Yeah, but we're Jay-Z
in this situation.

01:08:05.649 --> 01:08:07.517
We're not Jay-Z's friends.

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:09.986
We can't all be Jay-Z.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.522
There can't be four Jay-Zs.
That doesn't make any sense.

01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:13.890
You guys know I'd do anything
for you, right?

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:14.958
OSCAR:
Thank you.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:16.493
-Appreciate you.
-Just not this. I'm out.

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:17.894
OSCAR:
What are you talking about?

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:19.563
-RICHIE: What?
-This is crazy.

01:08:19.696 --> 01:08:21.564
Hey, we need you, all right?
You're the lookout.

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:23.167
Literally anybody
can be the lookout.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.901
-I don't need to be a part of
this. -No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:26.703
We need you.
You're our best friend.

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:28.037
-We trust you.
-Wha--

01:08:28.171 --> 01:08:29.906
Well, best friends
don't make other best friends

01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:31.640
do stupid illegal shit.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.643
You make me do stupid shit
for you all the time.

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:35.379
-Like what?
-Uh, I don't know.

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:36.645
What about the time
when you thought

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:37.881
-you had testicular cancer?
-Here we go.

01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:39.249
-Knew this was gonna come up.
-All right?

01:08:39.383 --> 01:08:41.984
And then I drive over
and you make me touch your nuts.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.321
I would've done it for you, bro.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.323
You're like, "Hey, yo, there's
something wrong with my ass."

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:48.024
-I'd be like, "Yo, bend over."
-Come on.

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:49.926
After everything
we've done for you?

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:51.261
IGOR:
What do you do for me?

01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:52.862
I let you tattoo my whole body.

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:54.331
So what?
You love my tattoos.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.032
You use me
as a human sketchbook.

01:08:56.166 --> 01:08:57.734
I-I-I-I don't, really.

01:08:57.867 --> 01:09:00.002
I don't.
Not as much as I say I do.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.339
I'm out of here. My bad.

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:04.674
You know what?

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:05.942
You're a real bitch!

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:07.444
-You're a bitch!
-IGOR: Shh.

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.513
OSCAR:
Yo, don't shush me.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.046
-RAY: Oh. -MARGIE: My God,
look how excited she is.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.283
-RAY: I'm assuming that's her.
-I started running too early!

01:09:13.417 --> 01:09:14.884
-(laughs)
-(squeals)

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:16.853
(Margie and Claire laughing)

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.055
Hey! Oh.

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:20.557
Oh, oh, oh, you're so skinny.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:21.791
-Have you been eating?
-Yeah.

01:09:21.925 --> 01:09:23.059
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:09:23.193 --> 01:09:25.194
How are you?

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:26.462
This is Ray.

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:27.731
-Hey. How you doing?
-CLAIRE: Oh.

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:29.131
-Nice to finally meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.466
Yeah, I feel like
I already know you.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.968
Your mom talks about you
all the time.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.870
-Oh, God. (laughs)
-Oh.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:35.939
No, only good stuff,
only good stuff.

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:38.575
Should we go eat? I am so sick
of eating off a tray.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.210
-You hungry?
-Yeah, I could eat.

01:09:40.344 --> 01:09:42.279
-Could always eat.
-Uh-huh.

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:43.479
RAY:
Beautiful school.

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:45.814
"Yeah, I could eat.
I could always eat."

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.116
Fucking asshole.

01:09:47.251 --> 01:09:48.917
RAY:
Look at those two angels, huh?

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.453
-SCOTT: Yeah, I know them.
-Yeah. -(women exclaiming)

01:09:50.587 --> 01:09:52.488
-Mm-hmm. -You walk them to
school, don't you? -(chuckles)

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:53.890
-Yeah, I know who they are.
-CLAIRE: Oh, my God.

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.626
-She's so cute.
-Look. Look at those curls.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.295
We took them to see
Stomp Off-Broadway.

01:09:58.428 --> 01:09:59.796
-They went crazy!
-JOANNE: Oh, my God.

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:00.930
I love Stomp.

01:10:01.064 --> 01:10:02.666
What's Stomp? What is that?

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:03.833
It's the greatest musical
of all time.

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:05.101
JOANNE: Yeah, it's, like,
that show where

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:06.936
people play the drums
on, like, garbage cans

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:08.805
and, like, tap with broomsticks.

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:10.139
-Stuff around the house.
-Yeah.

01:10:10.274 --> 01:10:11.608
-(drums on table)
-Like, you just see a toaster,

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:13.076
we make an English muffin.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.745
-They-they see a whole song.
It's incredible. -(laughter)

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:17.681
I know a homeless guy
that plays trash can lids

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:19.683
on the subway, for a dollar.

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:22.519
And then he took a shit
on the platform.

01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:24.621
Oh. Well, you know.

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:27.090
I don't know if he's gonna get
a Tony for that, but...

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.158
Maybe if they keep practicing
and get an adult diaper,

01:10:29.293 --> 01:10:31.961
they can, uh, get
to Broadway someday.

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:33.797
(laughter)

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:35.131
-JOANNE: Yeah.
-(Margie chuckles)

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:37.200
So, are you guys really serious?

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:38.835
Uh-oh.

01:10:40.103 --> 01:10:41.471
-(Claire chuckles)
-Well, actually,

01:10:41.605 --> 01:10:46.476
I'm going up to Boston to meet
his parents at Thanksgiving.

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:48.778
-Oh. -SCOTT: What?
You're going to Boston to--

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:50.680
for Thanksgiving? To wha--

01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:52.015
Well, where-where am I gonna go?

01:10:52.148 --> 01:10:53.483
-Ah, you'll come. You can come.
-CLAIRE: Yeah, me, too.

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:55.552
-We can all go. -Yeah, we'd
love to have you up there. -Oh.

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:57.487
You think you're gonna get
married again? (chuckles)

01:10:57.621 --> 01:10:59.523
Oh, boy,
look what I got us into.

01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:01.057
-Claire.
-(Claire chuckles)

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:02.392
RAY:
Well, you know what? I'll...

01:11:02.526 --> 01:11:04.561
I'll, uh, I'll answer that,
you know?

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:06.796
A couple of months ago,
I would've said no, but...

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.732
Uh, can we go?

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:09.733
MARGIE:
Scott.

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:10.734
Don't be rude.

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:11.968
Me? I'm not being rude.

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.403
He's talking the entire time.

01:11:13.537 --> 01:11:14.538
Wha-- He's the one being rude.

01:11:14.671 --> 01:11:15.772
RAY:
Was just making conversation.

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:17.273
MARGIE: Okay, so what
did you want to say?

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:19.142
-Cut this shit. -Tell us now.
-SCOTT: All I wanted to say

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.744
was I think
it's time to go, okay?

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:22.379
I had a great time.
This is wonderful.

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:23.580
I think we all bonded.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:25.815
It's time to leave now,
all right?

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:27.484
Well, we're going
to a party later,

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.052
if you want to come with us.

01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:30.454
You just can't embarrass me.

01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:32.188
Sure, whatever. Let's just
get the fuck out of here.

01:11:34.858 --> 01:11:36.760
He's in a good mood.

01:11:36.893 --> 01:11:39.763
Try doing it your entire life.

01:11:39.896 --> 01:11:40.997
("Uproar" by Lil Wayne
featuring Swizz Beatz playing)

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.566
-We're gonna have a good night.
-Oh, yeah.

01:11:42.699 --> 01:11:44.434
No, we're not.
I hate college parties.

01:11:44.568 --> 01:11:46.269
You've never been
to a college party.

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:47.837
Come on, just enjoy it.

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:50.574
-Relax. Go with it, okay?
-Yes, relax.

01:11:50.707 --> 01:11:53.076
* Five, four, three, two,
I let one go, bow *

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:55.178
* Get the fuck, though,
I don't bluff, bro *

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.614
* Aiming at your head
like a buffalo *

01:11:57.747 --> 01:12:00.717
* What the fuck, though?
Where the love go... *

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:01.918
What's your major?

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:05.054
It's, uh, uh,
evolutionary sociology

01:12:05.188 --> 01:12:07.591
with-with a splash of bio.

01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:09.793
Oh. I-I didn't know
you could do that.

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:12.061
Yeah, you can do whatever the
fuck you want. It's college.

01:12:12.195 --> 01:12:14.398
* I don't huff, though,
yellow diamonds up close *

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:15.699
* Catch a sunstroke *

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:18.702
* At your front door
with a gun stowed *

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:20.404
* Put the green in the bag
like a lawn mower *

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:22.572
* Hair trigger pulled back
like a cornrow *

01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:25.074
* What the fuck, bro?
Where the love go? *

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:26.810
I like your tattoos.

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:28.311
I'm an actress,
so, like, I don't think

01:12:28.445 --> 01:12:29.779
I can get that many tattoos,
because, like,

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:32.148
what if I get cast as, like,
an angelic role?

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:34.584
Like, I'm kind of, like,
a young Winona Ryder.

01:12:34.718 --> 01:12:37.554
So, like, I could play those
parts, and, like, also, like,

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.088
back when Shakespeare was
writing plays, like...

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:40.624
* Five, four, three, two,
I let one go *

01:12:40.757 --> 01:12:43.159
* Bow, get the fuck, though,
I don't bluff, bro *

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:45.128
* Aiming at your head
like a buffalo *

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:47.263
-What do you think?
-What is that?

01:12:48.598 --> 01:12:50.066
It's a butthole.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.601
-Get it?
-Oh, my God.

01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:54.170
* What the fuck, though?
Where the love go? *

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:55.605
* Oh! *

01:12:55.739 --> 01:12:57.340
-Uh-huh. -So, we're talking
about how the one percent

01:12:57.474 --> 01:12:59.409
keeps, like, getting bigger
and bigger and bigger,

01:12:59.543 --> 01:13:02.679
and the wealth inequality
is just out of control,

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:06.349
and we can't continue
with capitalism this way.

01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:08.752
Yeah, I'm s--
I'm sick of the rat race.

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:10.754
Yeah, no, exactly.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:12.321
Like, what happened
to the American dream?

01:13:12.456 --> 01:13:15.191
I know. It's like
an American nightmare now.

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:16.926
-(laughs): Oh, my--
Yeah, exa... -Right?

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:20.296
* What the fuck, though?
Where the love go? *

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:22.432
* Five, four, three, two,
I let one go, bow *

01:13:22.566 --> 01:13:24.267
-Bring it-- Oh, shit!
-Oh! Oh, shit!

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.535
Oh, shit!

01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:28.171
(shouting frantically)

01:13:28.304 --> 01:13:29.439
That was fucking fun.

01:13:29.573 --> 01:13:31.207
(laughs):
I know. It was so fun.

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.809
Yeah, like, I feel like,

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:34.978
I feel like I kind of fit in
for once, you know?

01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:37.046
And not everybody hated me
for the first time.

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.682
You should come here.

01:13:38.815 --> 01:13:40.884
Yeah? You think I can
get into a place like this?

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:42.719
I mean, you'd need a good GPA.

01:13:42.852 --> 01:13:44.220
Yeah, well, I don't have
a good one of those.

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:45.689
I-I didn't even
graduate high school.

01:13:45.822 --> 01:13:47.123
Don't you have to graduate
high school to go to college?

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:48.958
Yeah, but it's not, like,
too late to do that.

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:51.661
All right, even so, you know,
I-I'm a little too old.

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:53.296
I'd look like a narc, you know?

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.798
I would look creepy
in the corner.

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.966
-Everybody'd be like, "What's
that guy doing here?" -(scoffs)

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.202
Everybody here is so old.

01:13:59.335 --> 01:14:00.837
All right, well, I'm fucking
stupid, Claire, okay?

01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:02.305
Is that what you want me to say?

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.641
I can't pay attention.
I can't sit still, okay?

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:06.242
I'm stupid.
I'm a dumb idiot.

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.377
I would have to work ten times
harder than those people.

01:14:08.512 --> 01:14:09.913
And everybody would
fucking make fun of me,

01:14:10.046 --> 01:14:12.516
and I'm not ready to deal with
that again, all right? So, no.

01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:13.517
So, that's it?

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:15.752
Huh?

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:17.186
That's how long
you're gonna think about

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.588
going to college for?

01:14:18.722 --> 01:14:20.189
I mean, that was, like,
a 40-second walk.

01:14:20.323 --> 01:14:21.825
Uh, that's a lot of
consideration, don't you think?

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:23.426
Okay.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.529
-It's your journey.
-Indeed.

01:14:25.662 --> 01:14:28.164
Now, let's get down
to brass tacks, all right?

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.599
W-What are we gonna do
about Ray?

01:14:29.733 --> 01:14:31.501
-What do you mean?
-Don't act stupid.

01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:34.771
I mean, h-how are we gonna,
you know,

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:36.439
get Mom to break up with him?

01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:38.074
I think he seems fine.

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:40.209
-You think he's fine?
-What do you want?

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:42.378
It's Mom's choice to make.
We don't need to get involved.

01:14:42.512 --> 01:14:44.447
Yeah, I know, but we should
still protect her.

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:45.649
She can't just be with

01:14:45.782 --> 01:14:47.584
the first guy
she's been with since Dad.

01:14:47.717 --> 01:14:49.418
She got to, like,
peruse some dick.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.290
Mom doesn't need to peruse dick.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.359
-You know she needs to.
-I think she seems happy.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:59.062
You want her to have sex
with a ton of people?

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:01.297
No, but, yeah, kind of.

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:02.766
-I mean...
-That's gross.

01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:05.101
Well, if you knew something
was bad before it even started,

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.203
wouldn't you stop it
if you had the chance?

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:09.405
It's like that whole
baby Hitler thing, you know?

01:15:09.539 --> 01:15:12.041
If you had the chance to kill
baby Hitler before it grew up,

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:13.342
wouldn't you do it?

01:15:13.476 --> 01:15:15.078
Wouldn't you strangle it
until its eyes popped out?

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:16.880
So, Ray's baby Hitler?

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:18.782
Yeah. In this situation,
he is, yeah.

01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:20.049
He's baby Hitler.

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:22.285
So, do you want to help me
kill baby Hitler?

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:25.088
Okay, you're right, Scott.
You're right.

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:27.624
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Claire!

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:29.559
Claire!

01:15:33.296 --> 01:15:36.165
(music playing faintly
over headphones)

01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:37.466
Tell you,
Claire really seems like

01:15:37.601 --> 01:15:39.769
she's enjoying school, you know?

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:41.270
Yeah.

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:44.440
She's just blossoming.

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:46.009
Yeah.

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:48.277
Girl just seems like
she could take on the world.

01:15:48.411 --> 01:15:49.545
-(chuckles)
-I'll tell you,

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:52.448
whatever you did with her,
you did it right.

01:15:52.582 --> 01:15:54.784
Dump some of that on Scott,
you know?

01:15:57.787 --> 01:16:01.490
What do you think about
his tattoo restaurant idea?

01:16:01.625 --> 01:16:03.593
I think it's terrible.

01:16:03.727 --> 01:16:05.929
Getting a tattoo is like, uh--
it's a medical procedure.

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:07.631
You don't want to go
to the hospital

01:16:07.764 --> 01:16:09.766
and order supper, you know?

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:14.604
I just love that he has big
dreams, but he's just so lost.

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:16.439
I mean, no matter how much I try

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.842
to fill him with good energy,
he just...

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:21.344
he's got no self-esteem.

01:16:21.477 --> 01:16:24.447
He's really going nowhere.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.650
RAY:
Don't be so hard on yourself.

01:16:26.783 --> 01:16:28.151
Scientists have been
doing studies.

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:30.186
They say a lot
of this stuff is genetic.

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:32.321
You know, you inherit it
from your grandparents.

01:16:32.455 --> 01:16:33.723
So blame them.

01:16:33.857 --> 01:16:35.859
* *

01:16:40.864 --> 01:16:42.098
* When *

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:47.737
* When *

01:16:47.871 --> 01:16:49.505
OSCAR:
Let's go.

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.642
* When... *

01:16:52.776 --> 01:16:54.510
RICHIE:
Right. If anybody sees us

01:16:54.644 --> 01:16:58.514
or you hear sirens or anything
bad, you text me, "You up?"

01:16:58.648 --> 01:16:59.916
Could I just text you
something else?

01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:02.151
That sounds like I'm trying
to bang you, kind of.

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:04.220
-Just do it.
-Fine.

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:06.155
-Fine.
-Let's go.

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:07.724
-Let's roll.
-Hold on.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:09.425
All right, let's go.

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:10.526
SCOTT:
Good luck, homey.

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:12.295
Love you, Scott.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.335
SCOTT:
Oh, shit.

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:21.570
This is real.

01:17:21.705 --> 01:17:24.007
(alarm beeping steadily)

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.341
* When *

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:29.045
(keypad beeping)

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:30.880
(alarm beeps,
steady beeping stops)

01:17:41.858 --> 01:17:42.926
Yes! All right.

01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:49.232
(video game sound effects
playing quietly)

01:17:55.905 --> 01:17:57.340
You're dead.

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:01.878
MAN:
What's going on?!

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.112
RICHIE:
What the fuck?

01:18:03.246 --> 01:18:04.714
-Who are you?!
-You're not supposed to be here.

01:18:04.848 --> 01:18:06.382
What are you talking about?!
It's my store!

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:07.383
WOMAN:
Who are you talking to?

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.452
-Who is that?!
-Go back inside.

01:18:09.585 --> 01:18:11.254
-Go back inside! -What? Don't
tell me to go back inside!

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:12.455
MAN:
I'm handling this!

01:18:12.588 --> 01:18:15.124
SCOTT:
Yes. No. Yes.

01:18:15.258 --> 01:18:17.493
No. Yes. Yes. No.

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:18.795
Get the fuck out of my store!

01:18:18.928 --> 01:18:20.129
-I just don't want
to hurt you, okay? -Get out!

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:21.330
-I just... -You're not
doing this again, okay?!

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:23.099
-This is the third time!
-Enough of you guys!

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:24.400
-Third time this year!
-RICHIE: Shit! Shit!

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.169
-WOMAN: Get out!
-What the hell?

01:18:26.302 --> 01:18:28.504
-Get off me!
-MAN: Not today!

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:31.607
Not today!
Today is Alan Moskowitz's day!

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:37.246
SCOTT:
Well, who's the pretty lady?

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:39.983
Hello, Angelina Jolie.

01:18:40.116 --> 01:18:41.250
(chuckles)

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:43.352
(door rattling)

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:44.954
-Yo, it's locked!
-Where are the keys?

01:18:45.088 --> 01:18:46.455
We left the keys on the counter.

01:18:46.589 --> 01:18:47.757
Why'd you lock the door?

01:18:47.891 --> 01:18:50.193
Because I didn't want anybody
to come in, man.

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:52.261
MAN: You're not
gonna do this to me again!

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:53.596
Not in my store!

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:55.298
-We've never been here before!
-Shit!

01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:56.665
(gasping)

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.101
I'm standing my ground!

01:18:58.234 --> 01:19:00.003
-(gunshot)
-(panicked shout)

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:04.607
Fuck.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.043
Shit!

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:08.477
(groans)

01:19:08.611 --> 01:19:10.980
-"You up? You up? You up?"
-(text messages swooshing)

01:19:11.114 --> 01:19:12.281
-What's happening?
-Be quiet. Be quiet.

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:13.649
-Be quiet. Be quiet.
-(phone chimes)

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:17.520
(phone chimes twice)

01:19:17.653 --> 01:19:18.955
"Want to fuck? Want to fuck?
Want to fuck? Want to fuck?"

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.723
(grunting):
"Do you want to fuck?

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:22.725
Do you want to fuck?
Do you want to fuck?"

01:19:22.859 --> 01:19:25.494
(phone chiming repeatedly)

01:19:25.628 --> 01:19:26.562
(panicked shout)

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:27.696
Okay, right, Igor.

01:19:27.831 --> 01:19:29.098
-Answer the phone, Igor.
-(line ringing)

01:19:29.232 --> 01:19:30.399
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

01:19:30.533 --> 01:19:31.667
(panting)

01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:33.402
(ringtone playing
The Office theme song)

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:35.204
(whispering):
No. No. No. No. No.

01:19:35.338 --> 01:19:36.205
Scott.

01:19:36.339 --> 01:19:38.441
(ringtone continues)

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:41.610
(screams)

01:19:41.744 --> 01:19:43.246
(ringtone playing
"Push It" by Salt-N-Pepa)

01:19:43.379 --> 01:19:44.547
OSCAR:
Shut off your ringers!

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.682
-Goddamn it.
-(ringtone continues)

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:52.922
-(line beeps)
-Hey, Oscar, it's, uh, Scott.

01:19:53.056 --> 01:19:56.025
I was just, uh, wondering
if, uh, you know,

01:19:56.159 --> 01:19:57.760
you're almost done
with that thing.

01:19:57.894 --> 01:19:59.528
We need those keys.

01:20:05.201 --> 01:20:06.402
(panicked shouts)

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:12.341
* *

01:20:14.878 --> 01:20:16.212
Fuck that!

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:18.347
Holy shit!

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:21.417
(grunting)

01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:23.052
Come on, Igor!
Come on! Come on!

01:20:23.186 --> 01:20:26.422
(sirens wailing)

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:29.058
Um, the robbers are inside!

01:20:29.192 --> 01:20:30.693
Hands in the air!

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:32.195
The lady inside's got a gun.

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:34.230
OFFICER:
Get down on the ground!

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:35.698
OFFICER 2:
Do not move!

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:38.401
(siren approaching)

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:40.403
Why would you rob a pharmacy?

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:41.905
SCOTT: I wasn't
robbing a pharmacy, okay?

01:20:42.038 --> 01:20:43.772
I was the lookout,
for your information.

01:20:43.907 --> 01:20:45.608
The lookout is also
committing a crime.

01:20:45.741 --> 01:20:46.910
Are you fucking crazy?

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:48.277
Look, it's all
Ray's fault, okay?

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:49.778
He's trying to kick me out.

01:20:49.913 --> 01:20:51.915
So I panicked
and made a bad decision, okay?

01:20:52.048 --> 01:20:52.982
I'm only human!

01:20:53.116 --> 01:20:54.817
A bad decision?
That's a felony.

01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:56.219
Yeah, so?

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:58.454
I didn't even, I didn't even
go inside, all right?

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:00.123
Uh, it's not--
(stutters) I'm untouchable.

01:21:00.256 --> 01:21:01.790
I didn't do anything, all right?

01:21:01.925 --> 01:21:02.959
Uh, i-it's Ray, okay?

01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:04.493
He-- I-I know
he's up to something.

01:21:04.627 --> 01:21:06.896
-He's trying to erase Dad.
-Can you just let Mom be happy?

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.364
She is happy.

01:21:08.497 --> 01:21:10.299
Well, she will be, you know,
once I get rid of that guy.

01:21:10.433 --> 01:21:12.568
He's hiding shit, okay?
He's hiding shit.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:13.937
He's a weasel.
I-I'm onto him.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:15.471
This is why
I didn't want to leave,

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.406
'cause now all your crazy's
focused on Mom.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:18.908
I'm not doing
anything crazy, okay?

01:21:19.042 --> 01:21:20.944
Doing nothing would be crazy.
I'm doing something, okay?

01:21:21.077 --> 01:21:22.245
I'm taking action!

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:24.747
Leave Mom alone.
Stop acting like you.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:25.949
What's that mean?!

01:21:26.082 --> 01:21:27.583
You ruined my Halloween party.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:28.985
You know, you know what?
You know what?

01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:31.254
Go enjoy your party.
I-I got this.

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:34.123
You don't got this.
Don't do anything.

01:21:34.257 --> 01:21:35.258
I got this.

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:36.792
Don't do anything!

01:21:36.926 --> 01:21:38.928
* *

01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:56.445
Hey, Scott. What's up?

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:58.814
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

01:21:58.948 --> 01:22:01.217
I, uh... I just came by
to say hi to the kids.

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:02.351
Are-are they around?

01:22:02.485 --> 01:22:03.519
Oh.

01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:04.887
Well, they're not here.

01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:06.889
They went to their grandma's.

01:22:07.023 --> 01:22:08.357
Oh.

01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:10.659
Well, what do you got
going on over there?

01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:12.661
I'm trying to open
this bottle of wine,

01:22:12.795 --> 01:22:14.663
but I think I mangled the cork.

01:22:14.797 --> 01:22:16.065
(grunts)

01:22:16.199 --> 01:22:17.900
Oh, well, I could help.
You want me to help?

01:22:18.034 --> 01:22:19.668
Yes. Yes.

01:22:19.802 --> 01:22:21.170
Please.

01:22:22.005 --> 01:22:24.540
-Yeah!
-Yes.

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:27.043
So, uh, do you have a friend
coming over or something?

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:29.245
Oh, no. (chuckles)

01:22:29.378 --> 01:22:31.880
No, I just need some mommy time.

01:22:32.015 --> 01:22:35.884
Sometimes, mommies need to drink
when the kids are away.

01:22:36.019 --> 01:22:37.253
Oh, well, could I hang?

01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:39.222
I-I could use some mommy time.

01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:42.158
Sure, but are you
old enough to drink?

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:43.826
Yeah, I'm old enough.
I just-- I'd rather smoke.

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:45.228
Do you mind if I smoke in here?

01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:46.695
Oh, no. No.

01:22:46.829 --> 01:22:48.431
-(grunts)
-Let's crack some windows.

01:22:48.564 --> 01:22:50.899
-It's Tuesday.
-Really?

01:22:51.034 --> 01:22:52.935
'Cause Ray hates
when I smoke weed.

01:22:53.069 --> 01:22:55.338
Mm. Well, I hate Ray.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:57.040
Awesome.

01:22:57.173 --> 01:23:00.176
* *

01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:06.649
-Mm.
-You know...

01:23:08.017 --> 01:23:09.885
You have the sweetest,

01:23:10.019 --> 01:23:12.221
most adorable kids
I've ever met in my life.

01:23:12.355 --> 01:23:13.922
Like, I can't believe
they came out of Ray.

01:23:14.057 --> 01:23:15.758
I know.

01:23:15.891 --> 01:23:17.060
And you know what?

01:23:17.193 --> 01:23:18.861
You know what
the thing is about Ray?

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:22.098
I never say a bad word
about him in front of the kids,

01:23:22.231 --> 01:23:26.935
which is very difficult
because he's a cunt.

01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:28.437
Yeah, I-I can imagine.

01:23:28.571 --> 01:23:32.408
Well, I'm not one of your kids,
so have at it.

01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:34.943
Let it all out.
Tell me everything.

01:23:35.078 --> 01:23:37.280
Do you know he is fighting to

01:23:37.413 --> 01:23:40.483
actively not have custody
of his kids?

01:23:40.616 --> 01:23:41.884
-You can do that?
-Yeah.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.586
-That's insane.
-I know.

01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:45.088
Who wouldn't want
to hang with your kids?

01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:47.423
Who wouldn't want to hang out
with those kids?

01:23:47.556 --> 01:23:49.825
What monster wouldn't want
to hang out with those kids?

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:51.294
Every second!

01:23:51.427 --> 01:23:52.561
Your daughter sang
the other day.

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:54.097
What did she sing?

01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:56.099
Something from, like,
Oklahoma! or something,

01:23:56.232 --> 01:23:58.000
and-and I hate that shit,
and I fucking loved it.

01:23:58.134 --> 01:24:00.436
-(chuckles)
-She's such a little angel.

01:24:00.569 --> 01:24:02.805
-Mm. -I-I thought
she was a robot for, like,

01:24:02.938 --> 01:24:04.807
the first couple days
I was hanging out with her.

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:06.609
I know. She's so perfect.

01:24:06.742 --> 01:24:08.244
What a fucking putz.

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:09.678
Yeah, so he only
wants to see them

01:24:09.812 --> 01:24:12.315
on Wednesday night for dinner
and Sunday.

01:24:12.448 --> 01:24:14.683
-(scoffs) You can't just
pick and choose. -And, uh...

01:24:14.817 --> 01:24:15.951
No, you can't.

01:24:16.085 --> 01:24:17.286
What are your kids,
the NFL package?

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:19.088
-Wait, you're only-- Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:24:19.222 --> 01:24:20.989
But why would you want
your kids, really,

01:24:21.124 --> 01:24:25.861
if you don't have an apartment
and you sleep at the firehouse?

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:27.863
-(scoffs, chuckles)
-I mean, you...

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:29.198
Unbelievable. (chuckles)

01:24:29.332 --> 01:24:30.833
What kind of a grown man

01:24:30.966 --> 01:24:33.202
can't afford his own apartment
in Staten Island?

01:24:33.336 --> 01:24:34.837
Fucking loser.

01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:37.773
He lost all our money gambling.

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:43.011
He is homeless, he's penniless,
and he's a deadbeat dad.

01:24:43.146 --> 01:24:45.047
What is your mom doing with him?

01:24:45.181 --> 01:24:47.516
You know, my mom hasn't
gotten laid in 17 years,

01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:49.152
so I think her bar
is pretty low.

01:24:49.285 --> 01:24:52.020
Really? Yeah.

01:24:52.155 --> 01:24:54.022
He's good in bed,
I hate to say it.

01:24:54.157 --> 01:24:55.224
All right.

01:24:55.358 --> 01:24:57.493
Well, I didn't really
need to know that.

01:24:57.626 --> 01:24:58.527
Yeah.

01:24:58.661 --> 01:25:01.063
He's got a beautiful cock.

01:25:01.197 --> 01:25:04.567
I mean, it's the--
it's his only attribute.

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.802
That big thick cock
kept me in it

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:09.472
for eight years longer
than I should have stayed.

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:11.039
It's a fact.

01:25:11.174 --> 01:25:12.708
I knew I smelled you.

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:14.310
-The fuck, Scott?
-SCOTT: What?

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:16.212
Huh? What, are you
spying on me now?

01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:17.646
-You Magnum, P.I.?
-What?

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.014
Telling your mom
that I'm homeless?

01:25:19.148 --> 01:25:21.016
You think it's funny
to tell her that I'm a loser?

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:22.585
What are you talking--
No. What?

01:25:22.718 --> 01:25:24.320
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:26.189
You've been speak--
You talking to my ex-wife?

01:25:26.322 --> 01:25:27.923
Uh, yeah. She's actually
a really nice person.

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:29.592
-Oh, is she?
Why don't you marry her? -Yeah.

01:25:29.725 --> 01:25:31.260
Why don't you marry her
and see what the fuck happens?

01:25:31.394 --> 01:25:33.061
Hey, I'm just trying to protect
my mom from you, okay?

01:25:33.196 --> 01:25:34.330
You're a fucking psychopath.

01:25:34.463 --> 01:25:35.564
-Oh, I'm a psychopath?
-Yeah.

01:25:35.698 --> 01:25:36.732
I've been nothing
but nice to you!

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:38.167
I tried giving you direction.

01:25:38.301 --> 01:25:39.702
You're too busy
smoking your fucking weed.

01:25:39.835 --> 01:25:41.404
And all you've been doing
is trying to destroy

01:25:41.537 --> 01:25:42.771
everything that I have
with Margie.

01:25:42.905 --> 01:25:44.373
Because you're
a fucking loser, dude!

01:25:44.507 --> 01:25:45.908
You're a, you're a
degenerate gambler

01:25:46.041 --> 01:25:48.076
in your-your mid-50s,
who bets on the Jets.

01:25:48.211 --> 01:25:49.878
Uh, who-- Have you not learned
anything about betting?

01:25:50.012 --> 01:25:51.614
-The Jets are gonna come back!
-No, they're not!

01:25:51.747 --> 01:25:53.182
They got three
number one fucking picks!

01:25:53.316 --> 01:25:54.950
They're never gonna come back!
They're never gonna come back!

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:56.585
I'm trying to give
your mother a good life!

01:25:56.719 --> 01:25:58.721
I-- No, you're not, okay?
You're a piece of shit, dude.

01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:00.756
You're a fucking drug addict!
I'm a piece of shit?

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:02.625
Yeah, you're a piece of shit!
I'm a fucking loser?

01:26:02.758 --> 01:26:04.092
You're the biggest loser
I ever met in my fucking life!

01:26:04.227 --> 01:26:05.194
-Oh, really? You should know.
-Yeah! Yeah!

01:26:05.328 --> 01:26:06.395
You surround yourself with them.

01:26:06.529 --> 01:26:07.630
-Oh, yeah? Why don't you
try me? -Oh, really?

01:26:07.763 --> 01:26:08.964
Why don't you try me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

01:26:09.097 --> 01:26:10.333
This ain't gonna go
how you think it's gonna go.

01:26:10.466 --> 01:26:11.900
So why don't you get the fuck
out of my-- Really?

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:17.206
-Fucking asshole.
-Throw a fucking punch at me?

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.407
-Oh, yeah.
-Huh? You gonna cool off?

01:26:18.541 --> 01:26:19.775
-Come here, cocksucker.
-You gonna cool off?

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:21.076
-I'll fucking cool you off.
-(grunts)

01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:23.212
-Yeah, I'll fucking
cool you off! -(both yell)

01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:28.884
Hey, you cool off now?

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:30.553
You're in there
'cause of your own actions!

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:31.820
Are you kidding me?!

01:26:31.954 --> 01:26:33.656
I'm gonna tell my mom
you tried to drown me.

01:26:33.789 --> 01:26:34.757
In an aboveground pool?

01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:36.091
You're, like,
fucking eight feet tall.

01:26:36.225 --> 01:26:37.960
You're lucky my dad isn't here.
He would kick your ass.

01:26:38.093 --> 01:26:40.563
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what,
I knew your dad. Okay?

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:42.831
-Yeah? -Yeah, I crossed paths
with him a number of times.

01:26:42.965 --> 01:26:46.269
And you know what? He was even
a bigger asshole than you are!

01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:48.771
All right, that's it, that's it.

01:26:48.904 --> 01:26:50.072
It's over. It's over.

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:51.474
(grunts) Huh? Huh?

01:26:51.607 --> 01:26:53.141
-You like that? You like that?
-Ow.

01:26:53.276 --> 01:26:55.077
(both grunting)

01:26:58.581 --> 01:27:00.583
(muttering)

01:27:01.984 --> 01:27:03.352
-Jesus.
-Fucking asshole.

01:27:03.486 --> 01:27:05.521
-Come on, tap out! Tap out!
-(grunting)

01:27:05.654 --> 01:27:07.155
-Fuck you! No!
-Get me out! Let me out!

01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:08.324
-No! No!
-Let me out!

01:27:08.457 --> 01:27:09.625
-MARGIE: Oh, my God!
-Get me out!

01:27:09.758 --> 01:27:11.927
What's the matter with you?!

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.262
He's a psycho.

01:27:13.396 --> 01:27:14.597
RAY:
No.

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:16.499
-We're just talking.
-About what?

01:27:16.632 --> 01:27:18.667
-About him telling you lies
about me. -He's an animal.

01:27:18.801 --> 01:27:20.102
He picked me up
and he threw me in the pool.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:22.505
-All right? He has to go.
-No, I need you to go. Now.

01:27:22.638 --> 01:27:24.273
What? Why-why me?
He-he's the one who started it.

01:27:24.407 --> 01:27:25.708
Yeah, that's right.
Get the hell out of here.

01:27:25.841 --> 01:27:27.543
And get a job and a life
while you're at it.

01:27:27.676 --> 01:27:28.777
Your freeloading days are over.

01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:29.845
You, too. Get going.

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:32.014
Wait, what did I do?

01:27:32.147 --> 01:27:34.483
You put your hands on my son!

01:27:34.617 --> 01:27:35.684
You're not respecting my family!

01:27:35.818 --> 01:27:36.685
You're an animal!

01:27:36.819 --> 01:27:38.186
Look, okay, just listen.

01:27:38.321 --> 01:27:40.188
-Just calm down.
-I don't have to calm down!

01:27:40.323 --> 01:27:41.624
What are--
You're attacking my son!

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:43.392
And you're, and you're
making up lies!

01:27:43.526 --> 01:27:45.227
You made-- You tricked me into
thinking you're a good guy.

01:27:45.361 --> 01:27:46.429
You're not a good guy.

01:27:46.562 --> 01:27:47.896
-Right. Mm-hmm.
-You're a fucking small guy.

01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:49.898
Margie, Margie, just let me
explain this to you.

01:27:50.032 --> 01:27:52.034
-Just let me talk to you, okay?
-You are not in control of me.

01:27:52.167 --> 01:27:53.402
Okay, okay, listen, all right?

01:27:53.536 --> 01:27:54.903
Okay, you don't have
all the information you need.

01:27:55.037 --> 01:27:56.204
All right? Scott is acting out

01:27:56.339 --> 01:27:57.873
'cause he's afraid
to move on with his life.

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:59.408
It's no different than
when the Boston Red Sox

01:27:59.542 --> 01:28:00.709
finally won
a World Series, okay?

01:28:00.843 --> 01:28:02.144
-Oh, my God. -They had,
they had to get to a point

01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:03.346
-where-where they believed,
okay? -Just shut up.

01:28:03.479 --> 01:28:04.780
-All-all...
-Shut the fuck up.

01:28:04.913 --> 01:28:07.015
All I did was just ask him
a question, and he flipped out.

01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:08.551
So I put him in the water,
which is soft.

01:28:08.684 --> 01:28:09.718
I diffused the situation.

01:28:09.852 --> 01:28:11.153
It was what-what
m-my training's all about.

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:12.488
I-I wa-- I was totally
diffusing the situation.

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:13.522
Do you ever shut up?

01:28:13.656 --> 01:28:14.723
Do you ever just
shut the fuck up?

01:28:14.857 --> 01:28:16.325
You just talk and you talk
and you talk,

01:28:16.459 --> 01:28:17.560
and you don't know
what you're saying.

01:28:17.693 --> 01:28:18.994
It makes no sense.

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.929
It's like you picked up
all these little pieces

01:28:21.063 --> 01:28:22.931
of information from all over.

01:28:23.065 --> 01:28:24.867
They don't make any sense.
They're fragments.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.869
No sense. Nonsense.

01:28:31.006 --> 01:28:32.408
I-I'm not talking.

01:28:33.642 --> 01:28:35.444
I've had it up to here.
I'm done.

01:28:35.578 --> 01:28:38.013
Both of you,
get your shit out of here.

01:28:42.385 --> 01:28:43.819
Margie.

01:28:45.187 --> 01:28:46.455
(sighs):
Oh, fuck.

01:28:46.589 --> 01:28:47.456
Well... (sighs)

01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:49.792
Well, where do we go now?

01:28:49.925 --> 01:28:52.194
What are you asking me for?

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:55.330
You created this whole mess,
you fucking schmuck.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.402
* *

01:29:02.104 --> 01:29:03.506
(grunting)

01:29:25.461 --> 01:29:26.895
(phone buzzes)

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:30.599
Hey, man.

01:29:32.435 --> 01:29:34.002
(sighs)

01:29:34.136 --> 01:29:35.438
Are you mad at me?

01:29:35.571 --> 01:29:37.239
Me? No, of course not.

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:38.941
Are-are you mad at me?

01:29:39.074 --> 01:29:40.142
I mean,

01:29:40.275 --> 01:29:41.309
-no, but...
-Are they--

01:29:41.444 --> 01:29:43.111
Are they asking questions
about me?

01:29:43.245 --> 01:29:45.080
I'm not gonna snitch
on you, man.

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:47.416
But at the same time, like,
what am I gonna say to them?

01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:49.885
You were the lookout
that didn't look out.

01:29:51.286 --> 01:29:53.789
Um, well, I've been
meaning to ask you.

01:29:53.922 --> 01:29:58.861
Um... you know, since you're in
here, uh, well, I was wondering

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:02.197
if you wouldn't mind me staying
at your house for a little bit.

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:05.033
You came up here to ask me that?

01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:06.401
-I also came to see you.
-You came--

01:30:06.535 --> 01:30:07.936
No, you didn't come to see me.
You came to ask me that.

01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:09.071
And, no, you can't stay
at my house.

01:30:09.204 --> 01:30:10.372
I'm sor-- I have
nowhere to go, bro.

01:30:10.506 --> 01:30:11.840
-My house is frightening, dude.
-My mom kicked, my mom

01:30:11.974 --> 01:30:13.341
-kicked me out. -The fuck
are you doing with your life?

01:30:13.476 --> 01:30:14.977
Drive all the way down here
just to ask me

01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:16.211
if you can stay at my house.

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:17.613
-No, I-I...
-No, you don't love me.

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:18.647
I do love you.

01:30:18.781 --> 01:30:19.815
I'm sorry.
I-I-- You're right.

01:30:19.948 --> 01:30:21.116
I shouldn't have asked.
I'm sorry.

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:23.118
And you know what?
I need you to do me a favor.

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:24.487
Anything, bro. Just ask.

01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:27.556
You got to feed my cat,
all right?

01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:29.625
For the next
three to five months.

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:31.026
Is there anything else
I could do?

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:32.695
'Cause I'm-I'm kind of
allergic to cats.

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:36.331
You better look out
for Sprinkles,

01:30:36.465 --> 01:30:39.001
because I'm looking out
for you, all right?

01:30:39.134 --> 01:30:40.135
You got it.

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.970
And, listen, man.

01:30:42.104 --> 01:30:44.006
I need you to spend time
with Sprinkles.

01:30:44.139 --> 01:30:45.908
I don't want you just

01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:47.910
going in there,
feeding him and running out.

01:30:48.043 --> 01:30:49.411
You got to go in there,
scratch his belly.

01:30:49.545 --> 01:30:53.381
You tell him I miss him
and I'll see him soon.

01:30:53.516 --> 01:30:54.750
Right.

01:30:54.883 --> 01:30:57.152
Um, how, uh, how are the boys?

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.721
How's Igor and Richie
doing in there?

01:30:58.854 --> 01:31:01.323
I'll tell you right now.
I haven't seen Richie.

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:02.324
Igor?

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:04.092
Bro, look to your right.

01:31:04.226 --> 01:31:05.160
That's Carla.

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:06.361
Carla.

01:31:06.495 --> 01:31:08.396
SCOTT (whispering):
Holy shit! Get the--

01:31:08.531 --> 01:31:09.932
Bro, she's fucking real.

01:31:10.065 --> 01:31:11.066
She's fucking real.

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.100
She's fucking real.
Holy shit.

01:31:12.234 --> 01:31:15.237
Yo. She's hot, man.

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:20.375
SCOTT: He was telling the truth
the entire time.

01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:22.778
-Good for him, man.
-I know.

01:31:22.911 --> 01:31:25.013
-That's awesome.
-Yeah.

01:31:25.147 --> 01:31:28.016
-(crickets chirping)
-(snoring)

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:31.554
(door opens, closes)

01:31:32.755 --> 01:31:33.956
MAN:
Hey, you.

01:31:34.089 --> 01:31:35.423
What the hell
are you doing there?

01:31:35.558 --> 01:31:37.459
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was my house.

01:31:37.593 --> 01:31:40.529
Get out of my backyard!

01:31:40.663 --> 01:31:42.531
Get the hell out of here!

01:31:50.739 --> 01:31:52.541
I'm really glad we did that.

01:31:52.675 --> 01:31:54.276
It was really nice.

01:31:54.409 --> 01:31:55.578
-Me, too.
-(chuckles)

01:31:55.711 --> 01:31:57.379
That was awesome.

01:31:57.512 --> 01:31:59.481
Yeah. I missed you.

01:31:59.615 --> 01:32:01.383
-Oh, yeah? I missed you, too.
-(chuckles)

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:02.718
Just like, uh, old times.

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:04.252
I miss all my friends, you know.

01:32:04.386 --> 01:32:07.790
-(chuckles)
-Mr. Shark, Mr. Weird Skeleton.

01:32:07.923 --> 01:32:09.625
-Well, they missed you, too.
-(laughs)

01:32:09.758 --> 01:32:11.426
They missed you, too.

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:15.964
Hey, I, uh...
I'm in a bit of a situation.

01:32:16.098 --> 01:32:18.667
You think I could stay here
for a few days?

01:32:18.801 --> 01:32:20.669
What are you talking about?

01:32:20.803 --> 01:32:21.937
Well, it's silly.

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:23.471
Me and Ray got into
this big fight,

01:32:23.606 --> 01:32:26.642
and then my mom caught us, and
she just started yelling at us.

01:32:26.775 --> 01:32:29.612
And she threw us out, so--
She kind of lost her mind.

01:32:31.413 --> 01:32:33.248
Is that why you're here
right now?

01:32:33.381 --> 01:32:35.250
No.

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:37.653
Did you just fuck me
for shelter?

01:32:37.786 --> 01:32:39.154
No, I didn't fuck you
for shelter.

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:40.856
Uh, I-I-I didn't do anything.

01:32:40.989 --> 01:32:43.659
What? I didn't-- I just--
I just need a place to stay.

01:32:43.792 --> 01:32:45.661
(sighs):
Oh, God.

01:32:45.794 --> 01:32:49.031
Dude, dude, how many times
we got to do this?

01:32:49.164 --> 01:32:50.432
What do you mean?
I-I just want to...

01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:52.000
(sighs) I just need--
It's just for a couple weeks.

01:32:52.134 --> 01:32:53.168
It's not that big of a deal.

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:55.871
A few weeks?
You just said a few days.

01:32:56.004 --> 01:32:57.372
-Uh, or a couple months. It's...
-Months?

01:32:57.505 --> 01:32:59.107
(stammers)
I'm figuring my stuff out.

01:32:59.241 --> 01:33:00.308
I don't know the future.

01:33:00.442 --> 01:33:02.978
Oh, my God, you...

01:33:03.111 --> 01:33:04.713
There you go.

01:33:04.847 --> 01:33:07.816
-What the-- Hey.
-I'm not going to let myself

01:33:07.950 --> 01:33:09.785
be upset by you, but
I'm gonna tell you something.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:11.887
You make me feel so crazy.

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.789
I'm not gonna let myself
be crazy now,

01:33:13.922 --> 01:33:15.557
but you make me feel crazy!

01:33:15.691 --> 01:33:17.025
You are so crazy that you make

01:33:17.159 --> 01:33:19.527
everyone around you
feel fucking crazy.

01:33:19.662 --> 01:33:21.529
The people meet you,
and they're normal people,

01:33:21.664 --> 01:33:23.531
and then they hang out with you,
and then they're fucking

01:33:23.666 --> 01:33:24.833
Jack Nicholson in The Shining
or something.

01:33:24.967 --> 01:33:27.135
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:27.269 --> 01:33:30.038
I got to stay Zen.
I got to meditate.

01:33:30.172 --> 01:33:32.975
I'm meditating right now,
and you got to go.

01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:35.010
-What? What?
-Yeah, here's your shit.

01:33:35.143 --> 01:33:36.078
Okay.

01:33:36.211 --> 01:33:37.512
Staying calm.

01:33:37.646 --> 01:33:39.314
You got to leave.
It's time to go.

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:40.716
Well...

01:33:40.849 --> 01:33:41.850
Get out.

01:33:41.984 --> 01:33:43.551
Well, I don't have
anywhere to go.

01:33:43.686 --> 01:33:45.888
It's not my problem anymore.

01:33:46.021 --> 01:33:47.890
Thank you for the sex.

01:33:48.023 --> 01:33:51.159
It was wonderful
until you started talking.

01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:52.427
You got to go.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.596
Could I sleep
in your brother's room?

01:33:54.730 --> 01:33:55.731
No.

01:33:55.864 --> 01:33:57.532
But he has bunk beds.

01:33:57.666 --> 01:33:59.367
He's 14 years old.

01:33:59.501 --> 01:34:01.503
(TV playing quietly)

01:34:03.538 --> 01:34:05.573
Hey, yo, Dougie,
can I crash in your room?

01:34:05.708 --> 01:34:07.209
That's not happening, bro.

01:34:07.342 --> 01:34:09.177
(sighs):
Jesus Christ.

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:12.480
* *

01:34:19.421 --> 01:34:20.756
(sighs):
Fuck.

01:34:21.857 --> 01:34:23.859
* *

01:34:41.744 --> 01:34:43.746
* *

01:34:54.689 --> 01:34:56.959
Hey, do you know
where Ray Bishop is?

01:34:57.092 --> 01:34:59.895
He's in the back.
Come with me.

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:01.897
How about next time
you put your mask on

01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:03.265
before we get off the rig?

01:35:03.398 --> 01:35:05.167
I mean, I'm standing at
that front door for a minute

01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:06.668
-waiting for you. What the hell?
-I told him to.

01:35:06.802 --> 01:35:07.803
Always with
the backhanded compliment.

01:35:07.936 --> 01:35:09.071
Why can't you just, you know,

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:10.672
at least say
the nice thing and then...

01:35:10.806 --> 01:35:12.574
-Listen, you should be happy
with any compliment. -Okay.

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:13.742
-It's constructive criticism.
-It's...

01:35:13.876 --> 01:35:14.943
-It just-- It's always bad.
-Go ahead.

01:35:15.077 --> 01:35:16.745
I would respond better
to encouragement.

01:35:16.879 --> 01:35:17.980
I'm just...

01:35:18.113 --> 01:35:19.647
I encourage you
to shut the fuck up.

01:35:19.782 --> 01:35:20.648
(laughter)

01:35:20.783 --> 01:35:21.850
He's soft. He can't take it.

01:35:21.984 --> 01:35:23.318
-You're right.
-He's an emotional eater.

01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:25.187
RAY: Well, that's the problem
with this generation, man.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.388
They can't take criticism.

01:35:26.521 --> 01:35:27.990
-They get, they get
all-all upset. -I know.

01:35:28.123 --> 01:35:30.092
SAVAGE: Hey, I'm not
a whole generation, all right?

01:35:30.225 --> 01:35:32.094
I'm just, I'm just a man.
A man with feelings.

01:35:32.227 --> 01:35:33.628
-Oh, my God.
-Aw! -Aw!

01:35:33.762 --> 01:35:35.430
-Now you're making me look bad.
-(lively chatter)

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:37.265
-You're a man? -Now you're
making me look bad. Stop.

01:35:37.399 --> 01:35:39.667
(laughter, chatter continues)

01:35:39.802 --> 01:35:41.103
Ray.

01:35:41.236 --> 01:35:42.104
Hey, Ray.

01:35:42.237 --> 01:35:44.039
(chatter stops)

01:35:44.172 --> 01:35:45.974
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:35:46.108 --> 01:35:48.210
What are you doing here?

01:35:48.343 --> 01:35:50.645
Look, uh, I-I don't have
anywhere else to go, all right?

01:35:50.779 --> 01:35:52.347
I'm out of options, so...

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.715
Why would I care?

01:35:53.849 --> 01:35:55.283
I'm sorry. Like, uh-uh...

01:35:55.417 --> 01:35:57.285
Go sleep under a tree.
I don't care.

01:35:57.419 --> 01:36:00.688
Do you have any idea
what you took from me? Do you?

01:36:00.823 --> 01:36:03.625
Huh? You do a 60-minute
interview with my ex-wife

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:05.460
to find out
what kind of guy I am?

01:36:05.593 --> 01:36:07.029
What do you think
she was gonna say?

01:36:07.162 --> 01:36:08.964
-I don't know. I...
-By the way,

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:10.833
I'm not a gambler, okay?
I day-trade.

01:36:10.966 --> 01:36:12.400
I don't know the difference.

01:36:12.534 --> 01:36:14.469
You should've found out
before you shot your mouth off.

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:16.204
I know you smoke a lot of weed,
but you're not dumb.

01:36:16.338 --> 01:36:17.472
You knew what the fuck
you were doing.

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:19.541
You went to the person
that hates me the most

01:36:19.674 --> 01:36:21.143
to get the worst review
you could possibly get.

01:36:21.276 --> 01:36:22.710
Why didn't you come down here
and ask these guys

01:36:22.845 --> 01:36:23.778
what they thought of me?

01:36:23.912 --> 01:36:25.713
Did you ever think
of doing that?

01:36:25.848 --> 01:36:27.916
(sighs) I'm sorry.
You're right. You're right.

01:36:28.050 --> 01:36:29.417
-Uh, I shouldn't have done...
-You're not sorry

01:36:29.551 --> 01:36:30.652
or you wouldn't have done it.
So now what?

01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:32.087
Now you don't have
a place to stay?

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:33.889
So now you come down here
with your little puppy dog look

01:36:34.022 --> 01:36:35.723
on your face,
and I'm supposed to feel bad?

01:36:35.858 --> 01:36:37.259
Look, all I know is,

01:36:37.392 --> 01:36:39.727
if you're not nice to me, then
my mom will hate you forever

01:36:39.862 --> 01:36:41.496
and she'll never forgive you.

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:42.998
Really?
You're gonna play that card?

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:46.001
It's a, it's a pretty good card.

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:48.170
It's all I got.

01:36:48.303 --> 01:36:49.938
(crickets chirping)

01:36:50.072 --> 01:36:52.074
(men snoring)

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:02.750
(sighs)

01:37:02.885 --> 01:37:04.853
(whispering):
Ray.

01:37:04.987 --> 01:37:07.122
Hey, Ray.

01:37:07.255 --> 01:37:09.024
(singsongy):
Raymond.

01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:10.558
(whispering):
Ray!

01:37:12.194 --> 01:37:13.528
What?

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:14.629
Hey, I can't sleep.

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:16.098
I-I never go to sleep
this early.

01:37:16.231 --> 01:37:18.733
Oh. Well, you know
what you should do?

01:37:18.867 --> 01:37:20.402
You should shut the fuck up.

01:37:20.535 --> 01:37:22.237
Go to sleep.

01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:23.638
Thanks.

01:37:23.771 --> 01:37:25.073
Can't go to sleep.

01:37:25.207 --> 01:37:27.075
Why don't you
dip your weed in NyQuil,

01:37:27.209 --> 01:37:29.011
you fucking drug addict?

01:37:30.278 --> 01:37:33.015
(alarm ringing
and blaring loudly)

01:37:40.088 --> 01:37:41.789
Hey, w-what do I do?

01:37:41.924 --> 01:37:44.392
Do what you always do.
Sit there and do nothing.

01:37:53.368 --> 01:37:55.270
(truck engine starts)

01:37:55.403 --> 01:37:57.405
(truck doors closing)

01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:00.742
(birds chirping)

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:04.212
(yawns, coughs)

01:38:15.490 --> 01:38:17.525
Hey. Where do you go
to the bathroom around here?

01:38:17.659 --> 01:38:19.161
Well, number one, down there.

01:38:19.294 --> 01:38:20.996
Number two, Dunkin' Donuts
across the street.

01:38:22.965 --> 01:38:24.466
Have a wonderful day, man.

01:38:24.599 --> 01:38:26.001
Oh, thanks.

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:30.105
(sighs)

01:38:31.806 --> 01:38:32.874
(shower curtain opens)

01:38:33.008 --> 01:38:34.809
GARDNER:
How'd you sleep, big man?

01:38:36.444 --> 01:38:37.845
I hear you're Stan's kid.

01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:39.948
He was a brave man.
It's an honor to meet you.

01:38:40.082 --> 01:38:41.149
Thanks, man.

01:38:41.283 --> 01:38:42.684
It's a, it's an honor
to meet you, too.

01:38:42.817 --> 01:38:44.219
I-I didn't do anything, though.

01:38:44.352 --> 01:38:45.820
You don't think you did?

01:38:45.954 --> 01:38:46.955
No.

01:38:47.089 --> 01:38:49.691
I appreciate your sacrifice.

01:38:51.659 --> 01:38:53.295
No, I got this one
to impress a girl.

01:38:53.428 --> 01:38:55.297
Oh? And how did that work out?

01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:56.798
Not good.

01:38:56.931 --> 01:38:58.566
-We've been married 18 years.
-PAPA: Ooh, poor woman.

01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:00.635
-18 years, huh?
-Congratulations.

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:01.836
-Thank you.
-Wow.

01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:04.672
The rest I got, you know,
Maori, tribal.

01:39:04.806 --> 01:39:05.873
SCOTT:
It's beautiful work, man.

01:39:06.008 --> 01:39:06.874
Thank you, man.
I appreciate that.

01:39:07.009 --> 01:39:07.976
-What was that one?
-Maori.

01:39:08.110 --> 01:39:09.477
This stands for
strength and courage.

01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:10.512
-LOCKWOOD: Really?
Yeah.

01:39:10.645 --> 01:39:12.314
(door opens)

01:39:12.447 --> 01:39:14.816
What the hell are you
still doing here?

01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:16.551
Well, you know,
believe it or not,

01:39:16.684 --> 01:39:19.487
I-I couldn't find a place
to live in just a night, so...

01:39:19.621 --> 01:39:21.889
-I believe it.
-I'm kind of fucked, Ray.

01:39:22.024 --> 01:39:23.058
RAY:
Yes, you are.

01:39:23.191 --> 01:39:24.426
I'd say finish up
your free breakfast,

01:39:24.559 --> 01:39:26.428
and, uh, hit the bricks.

01:39:26.561 --> 01:39:27.862
All right. It's all right.

01:39:27.996 --> 01:39:30.032
The kid can stay.

01:39:30.165 --> 01:39:32.734
But you got to work, all right?
You ready to do some work?

01:39:32.867 --> 01:39:36.171
Yeah. Did... did you just,
did you just make me a fireman?

01:39:36.304 --> 01:39:37.739
(Rivera laughs)

01:39:37.872 --> 01:39:38.940
No.

01:39:39.074 --> 01:39:40.908
Go clean the toilets
or get the fuck out.

01:39:41.043 --> 01:39:43.345
Did I make you a-- What...

01:39:43.478 --> 01:39:44.746
RIVERA:
Hey, do me a favor.

01:39:44.879 --> 01:39:47.049
The bathroom downstairs--
I-I used it.

01:39:47.182 --> 01:39:48.583
You can start there.

01:39:48.716 --> 01:39:50.218
(whispers):
Great.

01:39:50.352 --> 01:39:52.220
Get gloves. Pretty muddy.

01:39:52.354 --> 01:39:54.022
You know, when I see
a big stain like that,

01:39:54.156 --> 01:39:56.724
I go up and down,
and then I go left and right.

01:39:56.858 --> 01:39:58.560
-Good times.
-There you go.

01:39:58.693 --> 01:40:00.395
You got to get the splatter.

01:40:00.528 --> 01:40:02.230
* *

01:40:02.364 --> 01:40:04.632
PALAZZO: You see that?
That's a nice straight line.

01:40:04.766 --> 01:40:08.070
Yeah, you guys, uh, got to do
a lot of shit work, huh?

01:40:08.203 --> 01:40:09.937
We don't refer to it
as shit work.

01:40:10.072 --> 01:40:12.107
This is our house.
We want it to look nice.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.941
You know, company pride.

01:40:14.076 --> 01:40:15.443
You got to wash it hot.

01:40:15.577 --> 01:40:17.979
Hot. Not warm, not cold.
Extra hot.

01:40:18.113 --> 01:40:19.647
-Okay.
-Because of the bedbugs.

01:40:19.781 --> 01:40:20.882
What-What's bedbugs?

01:40:21.015 --> 01:40:22.750
They're, uh, a-a tiny insect

01:40:22.884 --> 01:40:25.387
that get into your home
and they run you out.

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:27.122
* *

01:40:33.761 --> 01:40:34.929
(Scott groans)

01:40:35.063 --> 01:40:37.031
(laughter)

01:40:42.537 --> 01:40:43.971
-You know how they procreate?
-No.

01:40:44.106 --> 01:40:46.108
The male bedbug takes his penis

01:40:46.241 --> 01:40:47.975
and jams it into
the female's stomach.

01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:50.612
Does the female have a vagina?
Yeah, she does.

01:40:50.745 --> 01:40:51.746
It doesn't matter.

01:40:51.879 --> 01:40:53.815
He jams it into her stomach.

01:40:53.948 --> 01:40:55.750
Well, how do you know
all this, man?

01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:57.552
How do I know?
I researched it.

01:40:59.954 --> 01:41:01.756
-Just flip it over. Flip.
-Oh, just a flip.

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:02.990
-There you go, yeah.
-Okay.

01:41:03.125 --> 01:41:04.459
You got it.
Just flip it right down.

01:41:05.493 --> 01:41:06.661
-Very nice.
-Mm.

01:41:08.130 --> 01:41:09.864
Well done.

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:12.467
When you have bedbugs,
everybody leaves.

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:13.701
My parents stopped calling.

01:41:13.835 --> 01:41:15.437
My brothers and sisters
stopped coming over.

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:17.539
My girl left.
Everybody's gone.

01:41:17.672 --> 01:41:19.774
And you know who's there
for you at the end?

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:20.775
Ironically?

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:22.009
The bedbugs.

01:41:22.144 --> 01:41:24.112
PALAZZO:
I never thought I'd say it,

01:41:24.246 --> 01:41:25.713
but if I make chief,
I'm making you my aide.

01:41:25.847 --> 01:41:27.349
-PAPA: Yeah?
-What's up, kid?

01:41:27.482 --> 01:41:29.451
PAPA: Well, how do you think
you did on the test?

01:41:29.584 --> 01:41:30.585
PALAZZO:
Tough test.

01:41:30.718 --> 01:41:32.019
I mean, you know,
I hope I did good.

01:41:32.154 --> 01:41:33.188
Fuck!

01:41:40.094 --> 01:41:41.796
-He's doing a good job.
-(scoffs)

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:43.565
He knows how to wash a truck.

01:41:43.698 --> 01:41:46.301
Getting ready for his career
working at a car wash.

01:41:46.434 --> 01:41:48.803
You ever gonna give this kid
a break or what?

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:51.005
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

01:41:52.106 --> 01:41:53.875
Then do nothing.

01:41:55.877 --> 01:41:58.180
Were you on the job
when Stan was killed?

01:41:58.313 --> 01:42:00.582
Yeah. You know I was.

01:42:00.715 --> 01:42:03.885
What's the first thing
you thought of when you heard?

01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:09.891
I-I wondered if he had kids.

01:42:20.735 --> 01:42:22.604
Why do we have to clean
this thing anyway?

01:42:22.737 --> 01:42:24.739
It's just gonna get fire on it.

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:26.741
You think the people
that are burning alive

01:42:26.874 --> 01:42:28.776
give a fuck
if the truck is shiny?

01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:30.144
Just saying.

01:42:30.278 --> 01:42:32.013
I don't even know why
you got to clean the truck.

01:42:32.146 --> 01:42:35.016
What, you're trying to show up
all sexy to a fire?

01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:37.319
I like him.

01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:42.390
(shouting)

01:42:42.524 --> 01:42:44.158
(laughter)

01:42:49.431 --> 01:42:50.732
No! No! Stop!

01:42:50.865 --> 01:42:52.534
All right!

01:42:55.203 --> 01:42:57.205
Let me fix that backpack.
It's slipping.

01:42:59.907 --> 01:43:02.076
It's weird having you
walk me to school.

01:43:02.210 --> 01:43:03.478
Why is that?

01:43:03.611 --> 01:43:06.414
'Cause Scott always walks me.

01:43:06.548 --> 01:43:08.883
I walk you sometimes.

01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:10.618
I guess so.

01:43:12.354 --> 01:43:15.156
Is he, uh, is he weird
around you guys?

01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:16.458
No.

01:43:16.591 --> 01:43:18.260
He's nice.

01:43:18.393 --> 01:43:20.795
He asks me how I'm doing.

01:43:20.928 --> 01:43:23.097
What do you tell him?

01:43:23.231 --> 01:43:25.733
I say I'm doing fine.

01:43:25.867 --> 01:43:28.470
Look, you don't have to lie to
make me feel better, all right?

01:43:28.603 --> 01:43:30.772
I know me and your mom
could do a better job

01:43:30.905 --> 01:43:33.408
getting along through
all of this, and, uh...

01:43:33.541 --> 01:43:36.143
Hey, I'm sorry if I haven't
handled it so well.

01:43:38.446 --> 01:43:40.515
What's that?

01:43:40.648 --> 01:43:42.584
Oh, that's Ice Flash.

01:43:42.717 --> 01:43:45.787
Scott drew it for me,
but it didn't come out so good.

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:48.490
Yeah, I think his drawings
are a little shaky.

01:43:48.623 --> 01:43:50.258
That's the one that I drew.

01:43:53.428 --> 01:43:54.929
This is how he drew it.

01:43:59.934 --> 01:44:01.202
It's good, right?

01:44:01.336 --> 01:44:03.638
Yeah, it's better than good.

01:44:03.771 --> 01:44:05.707
Did a great job.

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:06.974
Yeah.

01:44:07.108 --> 01:44:08.776
He said he was gonna teach me.

01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:11.145
RAY: He said he'd teach you
how to do that?

01:44:11.279 --> 01:44:12.580
Yeah.

What's going on in here?

01:44:32.534 --> 01:44:33.668
Where-- Why is everything
so different?

01:44:33.801 --> 01:44:35.470
JOY:
Isn't it nice? Do you like it?

01:44:35.603 --> 01:44:37.905
Is that a pink chair?

01:44:38.039 --> 01:44:40.342
-Yeah, we've been redecorating.
-W-What's up with the drapes?

Where have you been staying?

01:44:49.050 --> 01:44:51.085
Oh, I've been, uh,
at the firehouse with Ray.

01:44:51.218 --> 01:44:53.821
Oh, okay. Well, I'm just glad
that you're not on the street.

bonding with the guys.

01:45:03.565 --> 01:45:04.699
-Oh.
-So, uh, yeah.

01:45:04.832 --> 01:45:06.167
Yeah, they got me cleaning.

01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:08.436
Uh, they got me, like,
washing stuff and, like,

01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:10.738
-working around the firehouse
and... -Mm-hmm. Oh.

01:45:10.872 --> 01:45:12.540
I really understand where
you were coming from before.

01:45:12.674 --> 01:45:14.108
You know, when you threw me out.

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:16.544
Like, I think I really
got my shit together now,

01:45:16.678 --> 01:45:18.613
and I'm ready to, like,
come back and...

01:45:18.746 --> 01:45:20.214
(laughing):
Okay.

01:45:20.348 --> 01:45:23.618
So, like, you think
you know what hard work is?

01:45:23.751 --> 01:45:25.620
Well, I wouldn't say that,
but, you-you know,

01:45:25.753 --> 01:45:27.288
I-I-I definitely have an idea.

01:45:27.422 --> 01:45:29.791
-(Joy laughing)
-You mopped a floor

01:45:29.924 --> 01:45:31.426
and-and you cooked.

01:45:31.559 --> 01:45:33.595
You cleaned a bathroom once.

01:45:33.728 --> 01:45:35.296
Oh. Oh, Scott.

01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:37.732
And how's your shoulder feel
after all that very hard work?

01:45:37.865 --> 01:45:38.733
(Margie and Joy laughing)

01:45:38.866 --> 01:45:40.034
Oh, you're making fun of me.

01:45:40.167 --> 01:45:41.102
Why are you making fun--

01:45:41.235 --> 01:45:42.470
I-I worked really hard. I did.

01:45:42.604 --> 01:45:43.471
Ask Ray.

01:45:43.605 --> 01:45:44.939
He's trying to get back.

01:45:45.072 --> 01:45:46.140

01:45:47.409 --> 01:45:48.943
Had one for breakfast.

01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:49.944
I'm full.

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:51.413
Hey!

01:45:51.546 --> 01:45:53.581
And-and wh--
and where's Dad's shrine?

01:45:53.715 --> 01:45:54.916
-Where-where-where...
-Oh, you're ruining the vibe.

01:45:55.049 --> 01:45:56.283
Where's his shrine?
Where's Dad's shrine?

01:45:56.418 --> 01:45:58.486
All of his stuff is gone.
All my shit's gone.

01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:00.087
-What's going on?
-Honey.

01:46:00.221 --> 01:46:01.489
Uh, all right, let--

01:46:01.623 --> 01:46:02.824
I'm sorry I raised my voice.
I'm sorry.

01:46:02.957 --> 01:46:04.125

01:46:04.258 --> 01:46:05.226

six months, so...

01:49:16.818 --> 01:49:18.620

for six months

01:49:18.753 --> 01:49:20.487

We didn't want to insult you

-No. Please.
-PAPA: Well, yeah.

01:49:26.728 --> 01:49:28.162
What, w-what was he like?

01:49:28.295 --> 01:49:30.331
He was kind of like you.

01:49:30.464 --> 01:49:32.166
You know, like,
if you didn't know him,

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:34.001
you'd think he was
a crack baby, but he was...

01:49:34.135 --> 01:49:35.469
(laughter)

01:49:35.603 --> 01:49:37.304
No, but he was a good guy.
He was a, he was a great guy.

01:49:37.438 --> 01:49:39.306
-He was a great guy.
-Well, I-I, I mean, I heard

01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.541
-he was fucking hilarious.
-Oh, yeah.

01:49:40.675 --> 01:49:42.176
And-and he got away
with so much shit,

01:49:42.309 --> 01:49:43.945
like, because he was
so freaking likable.

01:49:44.078 --> 01:49:46.113
What kind of stuff?
Like, w-what'd he get away with?

01:49:46.247 --> 01:49:48.382
One time, we were driving
down the West Side Highway

01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:50.317
-after being out all night...
-LOCKWOOD: Mm.

01:49:50.451 --> 01:49:51.318
You know this.

01:49:51.452 --> 01:49:52.954
This is a good one.

01:49:53.087 --> 01:49:54.288
And, uh, he's, like,

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:56.023
he's up on the--
through the sunroof.

01:49:56.157 --> 01:49:57.659
He's, like, sitting
on top of the car.

01:49:57.792 --> 01:49:59.393
We're like--
We couldn't get him in.

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:01.996
So we start speeding up,
stopping short, you know.

01:50:02.129 --> 01:50:03.497
(laughs)

01:50:03.631 --> 01:50:08.002
By the time we hit the bridge,
he fell onto the windshield.

01:50:08.135 --> 01:50:09.370
-(laughing): So he's...
-What?

01:50:09.503 --> 01:50:10.504
he's, like...

01:50:10.638 --> 01:50:11.739
-(laughter)
-SCOTT: What?

01:50:11.873 --> 01:50:14.341
Hanging on, cursing at us,
putting his face

01:50:14.475 --> 01:50:15.409
up against the windshield.

01:50:15.542 --> 01:50:17.879
He's like, "You motherfuckers!"

01:50:18.012 --> 01:50:20.314
-It was like some real
Tom Cruise shit. -(laughter)

01:50:20.447 --> 01:50:21.983

01:50:22.116 --> 01:50:23.918
(laughter)

01:50:24.051 --> 01:50:25.653
We get into Brooklyn.

01:50:25.787 --> 01:50:27.554
And sure-sure enough,
there's cops.

01:50:27.689 --> 01:50:29.523
Like, uh, like they were
waiting for us.

01:50:29.657 --> 01:50:30.858
SCOTT:
Oh, shit.

01:50:30.992 --> 01:50:32.559
PAPA: So now I'm like,
"Oh, fuck. We're screwed."

01:50:32.694 --> 01:50:34.996
Stan gets off the car.
He goes over to the cop.

01:50:35.129 --> 01:50:37.865
I'm thinking, "Oh, shit, he's
gonna fucking clock this cop.

01:50:37.999 --> 01:50:39.400
He's gonna, you know..."

01:50:39.533 --> 01:50:41.402
And he goes right up to him,
grabs his face,

01:50:41.535 --> 01:50:43.705
and he kisses him on the lips.

01:50:43.838 --> 01:50:44.739
(laughter)

01:50:44.872 --> 01:50:46.107
They went to high school
together.

01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:47.875
They went to fucking
high school together.

01:50:48.009 --> 01:50:49.711
I'm like, "Only Stan
could get away with that."

01:50:49.844 --> 01:50:51.112
I swear to God.

01:50:51.245 --> 01:50:52.413
Well, you know, the rumor is

01:50:52.546 --> 01:50:53.915
that he got the coke
from the cops.

01:50:54.048 --> 01:50:56.217
Not that cop. There was another
cop he knew in Manhattan.

01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:57.685
-(laughter) -What? No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no! No.

01:50:57.819 --> 01:50:59.453
-Coke? What? No.
-RAY: Guys, guys, guys.

01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:01.555
-Guys, it's his dad.
-So?

01:51:01.689 --> 01:51:02.724
-I didn't know it was a secret.
-RAY: It's his dad.

01:51:02.857 --> 01:51:04.058
You can't just tease me
with that.

01:51:04.191 --> 01:51:05.292
-Please, guys, but...
-It was...

01:51:05.426 --> 01:51:07.028
You don't understand.
My mom, my mom tells me

01:51:07.161 --> 01:51:08.162
all these stories about how much

01:51:08.295 --> 01:51:09.396
he's like a saint
and all that shit.

01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:10.798
Like, I-I would love
to hear a coke story.

01:51:10.932 --> 01:51:11.933
-Please.
-The PG-13 version.

01:51:12.066 --> 01:51:13.367
No, you don't--
No, the real version.

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.902
You don't understand the amount
of pressure I'm under,

01:51:15.036 --> 01:51:16.570
-thinking this guy's perfect.
-All right, fuck it, fuck it.

01:51:16.704 --> 01:51:18.205
All right, we were
coked out of our minds.

01:51:18.339 --> 01:51:19.540
-Nice.
-All right? We all were.

01:51:19.673 --> 01:51:21.542
-(laughing) -We all--
Well, I mean, uh, we were.

01:51:21.675 --> 01:51:23.410
-But that was a different time.
I mean, we all did it. -Right.

01:51:23.544 --> 01:51:24.578
This guy was the cokehead.

01:51:24.712 --> 01:51:25.980
-You were the cokehead.
-All right.

01:51:26.113 --> 01:51:27.949
I stopped four years ago.
You know that.

01:51:28.082 --> 01:51:29.116
What are you talk--
How do you think

01:51:29.250 --> 01:51:30.251
he stayed this skinny
all these years?

01:51:30.384 --> 01:51:31.618
No, I have a high metabolism.

01:51:31.753 --> 01:51:34.055
They should have his face
on a nickel in Bolivia.

01:51:34.188 --> 01:51:36.190
(laughter)

01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:40.327
PAPA: But playtime
was playtime, all right?

01:51:40.461 --> 01:51:42.830
Like, you know,
when he was at work,

01:51:42.964 --> 01:51:45.767
he was, he was all,
you know, business.

01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:47.935
All right? And he was the guy
you wanted by your side

01:51:48.069 --> 01:51:49.937
if-if you were
going into a fire.

01:51:50.071 --> 01:51:51.272
Yeah, I mean,
if they were gonna,

01:51:51.405 --> 01:51:53.307
like, build a fireman
from scratch,

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:56.343
he would've been, you know...

01:51:56.477 --> 01:51:57.611
-Prototype.
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:51:57.745 --> 01:51:59.613
Exactly.
You know, top to bottom...

01:51:59.747 --> 01:52:02.149
He's a fireman.

01:52:02.283 --> 01:52:03.417
You know?

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:06.120
-You know, as brave
as they come. -Yeah.

01:52:06.253 --> 01:52:09.991
You know, I was thinking about
what you said at the game

01:52:10.124 --> 01:52:13.761
about, you know, like,
firemen shouldn't have kids.

01:52:15.763 --> 01:52:17.098
Let me tell you something.

01:52:17.231 --> 01:52:19.633
You know, your dad,
he didn't just die

01:52:19.767 --> 01:52:21.468
saving those two people
that night.

01:52:21.602 --> 01:52:23.337
I mean, he did that a lot.

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:24.939
You know, like, sometimes,

01:52:25.072 --> 01:52:26.407
he wouldn't even
wait for the line.

01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:28.542
He'd just, he'd just go in,
like, a fully involved room,

01:52:28.675 --> 01:52:30.277
and you're, like--
I'm like, "What are you doing?"

01:52:30.411 --> 01:52:33.647
And because if-if he heard
there was somebody in there,

01:52:33.781 --> 01:52:35.682
he'd just go in.

01:52:35.817 --> 01:52:37.351
That's the way, you know--
(stammers)

01:52:37.484 --> 01:52:38.685
He-- That's who he was.

01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:40.021
That's how he was built,
you know?

01:52:40.154 --> 01:52:42.323
He couldn't, he couldn't
not be that way.

01:52:44.358 --> 01:52:46.227
You understand?

01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:49.563
Thank you. No, thank you,
thank you for sharing.

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:51.698
That's awesome.

01:52:51.833 --> 01:52:53.334
He would slap the shit out of me

01:52:53.467 --> 01:52:56.470
if he heard me say this
about him, but he was a hero.

01:52:58.205 --> 01:53:00.541
And heroes are necessary.

01:53:00.674 --> 01:53:03.244
And they should be allowed
to have families, all right?

01:53:03.377 --> 01:53:06.180
But I know it means, you know,

01:53:06.313 --> 01:53:08.883
that people suffer.

01:53:09.016 --> 01:53:12.086
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:53:12.219 --> 01:53:14.889
Well, but I'm sorry
for being a dick.

01:53:15.022 --> 01:53:17.859
-There's-there's two sides
to every story. -No.

01:53:17.992 --> 01:53:20.928
Thank you for sharing with me.
Thanks for taking me here.

01:53:21.062 --> 01:53:23.230
-All right, we don't
have to get all Oprah. -Yeah.

01:53:23.364 --> 01:53:25.099
-(mutters) It's all right.
-Hey, to Stan.

01:53:25.232 --> 01:53:26.100
-Yeah, Stan.
-Yeah, Stan.

01:53:26.233 --> 01:53:28.669
-Stan. -Stan.
-Stan.

01:53:28.802 --> 01:53:30.804
("One Headlight"
by The Wallflowers playing)

01:53:35.576 --> 01:53:38.012
(all singing along):
* Hey *

01:53:38.145 --> 01:53:40.181
* Come on, try a little *

01:53:40.314 --> 01:53:42.349
* Nothing is forever *

01:53:42.483 --> 01:53:45.186
* There's got to be
something better than *

01:53:45.319 --> 01:53:46.553
* In the middle *

01:53:46.687 --> 01:53:49.056
* But me and Cinderella *

01:53:49.190 --> 01:53:50.724
* We put it all together *

01:53:50.858 --> 01:53:54.828
* We can drive it home *

01:53:56.497 --> 01:53:58.900
* With one headlight *

01:53:59.033 --> 01:54:02.236
(cheering, excited chatter)

01:54:05.072 --> 01:54:08.242
-* She said it's cold, it
feels like... * -(song fades)

01:54:08.375 --> 01:54:09.676
My head hurts. I--

01:54:09.810 --> 01:54:12.613
This-this is why I don't drink.
I just, I just smoke weed.

01:54:14.615 --> 01:54:16.650
Hey, so what are you gonna do?

01:54:16.783 --> 01:54:18.119
(Scott sighs)

01:54:18.252 --> 01:54:20.988
With-with what?

01:54:21.122 --> 01:54:22.756
With your life.

01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:26.593
You must be passionate
about something.

01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:30.797
Um, yeah, the...
the tattoo thing.

01:54:30.932 --> 01:54:33.200
I... I love that.

01:54:34.635 --> 01:54:36.837
Were you, like, into that?

01:54:36.971 --> 01:54:41.208
No, you know, it-it takes a lot
of practice, you know, and...

01:54:42.977 --> 01:54:46.280
None of my friends will let me
tattoo them anymore and...

01:54:46.413 --> 01:54:48.415
Hey, why don't you
give me a tattoo?

01:54:49.450 --> 01:54:50.985
What?

01:54:51.118 --> 01:54:52.286
What-what?

01:54:52.419 --> 01:54:53.754
Come on, I don't have
any tattoos.

01:54:53.887 --> 01:54:56.823
I'm a, I'm a blank slate, man.
(chuckles)

01:54:56.958 --> 01:54:58.825
Put it on my back.
Yeah, use it for practice.

01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:00.827
Well... well,
you're just saying this

01:55:00.962 --> 01:55:02.296
'cause you're drunk, right?
You're not...

01:55:02.429 --> 01:55:03.664
-You're not actually...
-Isn't everybody drunk

01:55:03.797 --> 01:55:05.933
when they get
their first tattoo?

01:55:06.067 --> 01:55:07.268
Touché, Ray.

01:55:07.401 --> 01:55:08.535
Yeah.

01:55:08.669 --> 01:55:10.271
It's my back.
I don't give a fuck.

01:55:10.404 --> 01:55:12.306
I'm never gonna see it.

01:55:12.439 --> 01:55:15.642
Plus, I got to tell you
something, you know.

01:55:15.776 --> 01:55:18.345
I saw that drawing
you did for Harold.

01:55:20.347 --> 01:55:23.217
I was kind of blown away
by it, man. You...

01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:25.219
You're getting
really good at it.

01:55:25.352 --> 01:55:27.288
I'm practicing a lot.

01:55:27.421 --> 01:55:29.023
Yeah.

01:55:29.156 --> 01:55:30.992
Like anything, you keep
doing it, you get better at it.

01:55:31.125 --> 01:55:32.626
And I, you know...

01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:36.397
You know, I do want to see you
do well, all right?

01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:39.300
I-I believe in you.

01:55:39.433 --> 01:55:40.867
Thanks, man.

01:55:41.002 --> 01:55:43.804
You... you must really love me.

01:55:43.937 --> 01:55:45.772
I love you, too.

01:55:49.043 --> 01:55:50.877
Uh, I-I appreciate that,
but I'm not ready...

01:55:51.012 --> 01:55:52.346
Y-You-you gonna say it back?

01:55:52.479 --> 01:55:54.148
I'm not ready to say
something like that.

01:55:54.281 --> 01:55:55.482
You got to say it back.

01:55:55.616 --> 01:55:56.950
What-what if I die tomorrow?

01:55:58.385 --> 01:56:00.654
Then I'll be that guy saying,

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:02.689
"You know, even though
I never said it..."

01:56:02.823 --> 01:56:05.059
(both laughing)

01:56:06.293 --> 01:56:07.394
Uh, look...

01:56:07.528 --> 01:56:09.030
I would love
to tattoo your back.

01:56:09.163 --> 01:56:10.564
Okay, cool.

01:56:10.697 --> 01:56:13.900
All right, but here's the deal.
No unicorns.

01:56:14.035 --> 01:56:15.902
-No rainbows, all right?
-Uh.

01:56:16.037 --> 01:56:17.771
None of that shit
little girls like to color in.

01:56:17.904 --> 01:56:18.772
(laughs):
Okay.

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:20.607
No body parts. No nudity.

01:56:20.741 --> 01:56:22.043
-Okay.
-No Chinese letters.

01:56:22.176 --> 01:56:23.277
-All right. All right, fine.
-I want, I...

01:56:23.410 --> 01:56:24.278
I want to be able
to fucking read

01:56:24.411 --> 01:56:25.779
whatever you put back there.

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:28.382
I don't need some o-order for
orange chicken or some shit.

01:56:28.515 --> 01:56:30.051
All right.

01:56:30.184 --> 01:56:31.452
Here we go. You ready?

01:56:31.585 --> 01:56:33.420
Yep, let's do it.
Let's get it over with.

01:56:33.554 --> 01:56:35.022
Yeah, I-I really
appreciate this.

01:56:35.156 --> 01:56:37.891
This is--
It's actually very nice.

01:56:38.025 --> 01:56:38.925
Good.

01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:41.228
All right.

01:56:41.362 --> 01:56:42.729
(tattoo gun buzzing)

01:56:43.764 --> 01:56:46.467
(groans) Fuck.

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.701
(laughs)

01:56:47.834 --> 01:56:49.636
Dude, why do you get these?

01:56:49.770 --> 01:56:51.638
Um, I don't know. I, uh...

01:56:51.772 --> 01:56:53.440
Whenever I'm going
through something, I just,

01:56:53.574 --> 01:56:54.808
you know, I get one.

01:56:54.941 --> 01:56:56.443
It relaxes me
and calms me down.

01:56:56.577 --> 01:56:58.279
Helps me, like,
think things through, you know.

01:56:58.412 --> 01:57:01.082
-This relaxes you?
-Yeah.

01:57:01.215 --> 01:57:03.917
You ever think of taking,
like, a yoga class?

01:57:04.051 --> 01:57:05.552
Meditating?

01:57:05.686 --> 01:57:07.754
Why don't you just give blood?

01:57:07.888 --> 01:57:09.623
(groans):
There's still needles involved.

01:57:09.756 --> 01:57:11.258
Yeah, that's a nice tattoo.

01:57:11.392 --> 01:57:12.593
It's aces.

01:57:14.261 --> 01:57:16.263
-You looking at my cards,
you piece of shit? -What?

01:57:16.397 --> 01:57:17.498
No, no, no, no.
I'm talking about the tattoo.

01:57:17.631 --> 01:57:18.565
What are you doing?

01:57:18.699 --> 01:57:20.000
-What?
-First good hand you dealt me

01:57:20.134 --> 01:57:21.268
all night, you're cheating?

01:57:21.402 --> 01:57:22.569
-He was talking about
the tattoo. -Exactly.

01:57:22.703 --> 01:57:24.971
-You are the worst liar ever.
-(laughter)

01:57:25.106 --> 01:57:26.807
What's six times four?

01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:28.008
-24.
-(tattoo gun buzzing)

01:57:28.142 --> 01:57:30.010
(groaning):
24. Yeah, 24.

01:57:30.144 --> 01:57:32.146
What's seven times five?

01:57:33.147 --> 01:57:34.115
(mouthing)

01:57:34.248 --> 01:57:36.917
-35.
-Good job.

01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:38.585
Look how smart you are.
(groans)

01:57:38.719 --> 01:57:39.953
I'm trying to guess
what you're drawing

01:57:40.087 --> 01:57:41.622
by the, by the way
your hand's going.

01:57:41.755 --> 01:57:43.690
Remember, nothing weird
or I'll kill you.

01:57:43.824 --> 01:57:45.359
-SCOTT: Nothing weird.
-Okay.

01:57:45.492 --> 01:57:46.693
It doesn't look weird, does it?

01:57:46.827 --> 01:57:48.028
No, not at all.

01:57:48.162 --> 01:57:50.464
RAY: Oh, good, 'cause
you know I'll murder him.

01:57:50.597 --> 01:57:51.998
It looks wonderful.

01:57:52.133 --> 01:57:54.101
Oh! Is it supposed to hurt?

01:57:54.235 --> 01:57:56.137
Is it supposed to hurt
that much?

01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:58.139
It's-it's a needle
going into your back. Yeah.

01:57:58.272 --> 01:58:01.308
I know, but I thought
I had more back fat than that.

01:58:01.442 --> 01:58:02.976
Can I get a tattoo?

01:58:03.110 --> 01:58:03.977
-No. No.
-SCOTT: Sure.

01:58:04.111 --> 01:58:04.978
-All right.
-No.

01:58:05.112 --> 01:58:05.979
Never.

01:58:06.113 --> 01:58:07.414
Don't mess with perfection.

01:58:09.150 --> 01:58:10.451
(alarm ringing
and blaring loudly)

01:58:10.584 --> 01:58:11.785
WOMAN (over speakers):
Everybody goes.

01:58:11.918 --> 01:58:13.454
Both companies, first due.

01:58:13.587 --> 01:58:15.722
Phone alarm. Box 3-4-3.

01:58:15.856 --> 01:58:18.725
18 Carpenter Avenue
between Rockland and Franklin.

01:58:18.859 --> 01:58:21.027
Smoke coming from the second-
floor window of a private home.

01:58:21.162 --> 01:58:22.028
-(truck engine starts)
-Turnout.

01:58:22.163 --> 01:58:24.831
(sirens wailing)

01:58:33.674 --> 01:58:35.676
(birds chirping)

01:58:37.678 --> 01:58:39.680
(pants) Yoo-hoo.

01:58:39.813 --> 01:58:41.182
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

01:58:41.315 --> 01:58:42.516
Hey, man. How you doing?

01:58:42.649 --> 01:58:43.717
What's up, man?

01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:45.051
I need some assistance
over here, please.

01:58:45.186 --> 01:58:46.420
-Sure, I...
-Hey, give me a sh...

01:58:46.553 --> 01:58:48.422
-Oh, my God!
-Ah, don't worry about it.

01:58:48.555 --> 01:58:50.891
Listen, everything's all good.

01:58:51.024 --> 01:58:51.892
It's, uh, really nothing.

01:58:52.025 --> 01:58:53.227
I just need a little assistance.

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:54.861
This is something that needs
to be taken care of now.

01:58:54.995 --> 01:58:56.730
What happened? Are you okay?
Did you get shot?

01:58:56.863 --> 01:58:58.932
-Were you stabbed?
-It's not really a big deal.

01:58:59.065 --> 01:59:00.734
My vape exploded in my pocket.
Just...

01:59:00.867 --> 01:59:03.237
I didn't stretch
right before yoga.

01:59:03.370 --> 01:59:05.872
I was playing tennis.
I slipped.

01:59:06.006 --> 01:59:08.074
-Well, which one is it?
-What do you want me to say?

01:59:08.209 --> 01:59:09.476
It was nothing.

01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:12.713
I just need some medical
attention, but just by you.

01:59:12.846 --> 01:59:15.015
Dude, I got to call 911.
I don't know what to do.

01:59:15.148 --> 01:59:17.050
No, no, no, listen, listen.
No police, please.

01:59:17.184 --> 01:59:18.252
Not today.

01:59:18.385 --> 01:59:20.120
-What does that even mean?
-No.

01:59:20.254 --> 01:59:21.922
We don't need to get
the government involved

01:59:22.055 --> 01:59:22.956
into this situation.

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:24.291
We can handle this together.

01:59:24.425 --> 01:59:26.427
Dude, I'm so high.
I can't help you right now.

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:28.429
I'm high, too.

01:59:28.562 --> 01:59:30.631
Well, then you know how I feel.

01:59:30.764 --> 01:59:32.799
-(groans)
-What do you want me to do?

01:59:32.933 --> 01:59:34.235
Take a look at this.

01:59:34.368 --> 01:59:35.936
I need some sort of foam.

01:59:36.069 --> 01:59:37.471
-Holy shit!
-You got some stitching?

01:59:37.604 --> 01:59:39.139
-Dude! -Do-do you have,
like, a little needle?

01:59:39.273 --> 01:59:40.774
-Do you have something
with a needlepoint? -No.

01:59:40.907 --> 01:59:42.075
What happened?

01:59:42.209 --> 01:59:43.944
It was a misunderstanding.
It was an argument.

01:59:44.077 --> 01:59:45.912
But we're all friends again.
We worked it out.

01:59:46.046 --> 01:59:47.214
You know how buddies get.

01:59:47.348 --> 01:59:49.283
Dude, I-- We-we, we got to
take you to the hospital

01:59:49.416 --> 01:59:51.485
-or you're gonna die.
-I'm not gonna die.

01:59:51.618 --> 01:59:52.786
-Yes, you are.
-I'm gonna die?

01:59:52.919 --> 01:59:53.887
Yeah, I'm positive.

01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:55.055
I'm positive
that you're gonna die

01:59:55.188 --> 01:59:56.490
if we don't go to the hospital.

01:59:56.623 --> 01:59:58.625
-(siren wailing)
-(man groans)

02:00:01.362 --> 02:00:02.996
(man groans)

02:00:03.129 --> 02:00:04.498
Are there metal detectors
in here?

02:00:04.631 --> 02:00:05.899
I-I'm not sure. Why?

02:00:06.032 --> 02:00:07.401
Don't even worry about it.

02:00:07.534 --> 02:00:09.236
I'll tell you later.

02:00:09.370 --> 02:00:10.471
Oh, shit.

02:00:10.604 --> 02:00:11.738
(groans)

02:00:11.872 --> 02:00:13.340
-Oh, fuck.
-You'll be all right.

02:00:13.474 --> 02:00:14.841
-Oh, my God.
-You'll be all right.

02:00:14.975 --> 02:00:16.443
-Guys, I need help!
-(groaning)

02:00:16.577 --> 02:00:18.645
This guy's bleeding!
He's losing a lot of blood!

02:00:18.779 --> 02:00:20.314
-I need a gurney, please!
-Oh, thank you.

02:00:20.447 --> 02:00:21.848
-All right, just hold-- Put...
-Thank you.

02:00:21.982 --> 02:00:24.150
-Put pressure on it, all right?
-(groaning)

02:00:24.285 --> 02:00:26.119
Hi. This guy's been, uh,
either shot or stabbed.

02:00:26.253 --> 02:00:28.188
I don't know. He's been
kind of vague about it.

02:00:28.322 --> 02:00:30.491
Sir, have you been shot?
Stabbed?

02:00:30.624 --> 02:00:31.625
No.

02:00:31.758 --> 02:00:33.794
-I fell in a thorn bush.
-Okay.

02:00:33.927 --> 02:00:35.596
Have him fill out
this paperwork,

02:00:35.729 --> 02:00:39.032
and the doctor will call you
when he's ready.

02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:41.134
Do me a favor, man.
Can we just switch identities?

02:00:41.268 --> 02:00:42.235
What? No.

02:00:42.369 --> 02:00:43.637
Just let me use
your driver's license.

02:00:43.770 --> 02:00:45.939
-We look nothing alike, dude.
-No one's gonna know.

02:00:46.072 --> 02:00:47.441
Just trust me.

02:00:47.574 --> 02:00:49.810
I'm bleeding.
It feels like I have to shit.

02:00:49.943 --> 02:00:51.978
Oh, Jesus Christ.

02:00:52.112 --> 02:00:53.246
I'm Margie's son. Do you know--

02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:54.281
-I'm Margie's son.
-(woman speaking Spanish)

02:00:54.415 --> 02:00:56.350
I don't know who that is.

02:00:56.483 --> 02:00:58.485
-I'm just filling in.
-(continues speaking Spanish)

02:00:58.619 --> 02:01:00.053
Okay.

02:01:00.186 --> 02:01:02.055
-I know.
-My pain keeps coming.

02:01:02.188 --> 02:01:04.558
Tell that fucking cocksucker,
my father, that I hate him

02:01:04.691 --> 02:01:07.528
and I love him at the same time
and I forgive him.

02:01:07.661 --> 02:01:10.297
I-I-I do not need to do that,
because you're gonna live.

02:01:11.765 --> 02:01:13.967
Tell my sister
I know she's my mother.

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:15.869
Huh.

02:01:16.002 --> 02:01:17.871
Got here as soon as I could.

02:01:18.004 --> 02:01:19.573
Hey, man, we got to
help this guy.

02:01:19.706 --> 02:01:20.574
He's bleeding out.

02:01:20.707 --> 02:01:22.142
This a cop?

02:01:22.275 --> 02:01:23.710
He looks like a cop.

02:01:23.844 --> 02:01:25.011
Excuse me, ma'am.

02:01:25.145 --> 02:01:26.347
Ray Bishop, Ladder 57.

02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:27.914
We got to get this guy
some help.

02:01:28.048 --> 02:01:29.316
We got to move it along here.

02:01:29.450 --> 02:01:30.817
-Follow me.
-Okay, come on, buddy.

02:01:30.951 --> 02:01:32.052
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

02:01:32.185 --> 02:01:33.520
Here we go, here we go,
here we go.

02:01:33.654 --> 02:01:36.022
-(man groaning)
-All right.

02:01:36.156 --> 02:01:37.558
Abdominal wound!

02:01:37.691 --> 02:01:38.859
RAY:
There we go.

02:01:38.992 --> 02:01:40.193
Where? Where?

02:01:40.327 --> 02:01:41.528
Put him in Two.

02:01:41.662 --> 02:01:42.563
In Two.

02:01:42.696 --> 02:01:44.097
DOCTOR:
Let's get vitals.

02:01:44.230 --> 02:01:45.566
-All right, buddy.
-All right, get him right here.

02:01:45.699 --> 02:01:46.733
We got to get your shirt off.

02:01:46.867 --> 02:01:48.201
Let me know if you need trauma.

02:01:48.335 --> 02:01:50.203
-(groans): Oh, shit.
-Okay. Here we go.

02:01:50.337 --> 02:01:52.839
-Nice and easy, nice and easy.
-I'll meet you at Six. Six.

02:01:52.973 --> 02:01:54.841
(man groans)

02:01:54.975 --> 02:01:57.077
JOY:
You okay? It's gonna be okay.

02:01:57.210 --> 02:01:58.679
(mutters)

02:02:04.351 --> 02:02:05.586
He's one of your friends?

02:02:05.719 --> 02:02:07.688
No, no, no.
I-I was just helping him.

02:02:07.821 --> 02:02:09.122
Yeah, Scott brought him in.

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:10.857
You know, guy just kind of
wandered into the firehouse

02:02:10.991 --> 02:02:12.092
while we were out on a call.

02:02:12.225 --> 02:02:14.361
You guys are covered in blood.
Take these off.

02:02:14.495 --> 02:02:15.896
Throw 'em here.

02:02:18.665 --> 02:02:20.401
Put 'em over here.

02:02:20.534 --> 02:02:21.802
Just leave 'em there.
Down there.

02:02:21.935 --> 02:02:22.903
What's that?

02:02:23.036 --> 02:02:25.772
-What's that?
-Oh.

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:29.209
I let your son practice on me.

02:02:29.342 --> 02:02:31.412
How's it look? He won't let me
see it till it's done.

02:02:31.545 --> 02:02:33.113
Let me see it.

02:02:33.246 --> 02:02:35.949
* *

02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:43.724
He, um, he-he let me do
whatever I wanted, so...

02:02:45.892 --> 02:02:47.394
Jesus Christ.

02:02:47.528 --> 02:02:50.664
RAY: He didn't put anything
stupid on there, did he?

02:02:50.797 --> 02:02:52.232
Took forever.

02:02:58.405 --> 02:02:59.806
(Margie sighs)

02:03:10.383 --> 02:03:11.585
Nah.

02:03:13.386 --> 02:03:15.522
SCOTT: Yeah, I, um...
I can never get the eyes right

02:03:15.656 --> 02:03:17.624
'cause I-I just make them
too dark, but I-I...

02:03:17.758 --> 02:03:19.593
It's beautiful.

02:03:20.827 --> 02:03:22.629
I'm proud of you.

02:03:22.763 --> 02:03:25.298
-You could really do this.
-Thanks.

02:03:25.432 --> 02:03:26.800
There's not any, like,
Chinese characters

02:03:26.933 --> 02:03:28.469
or anything back there,
is there?

02:03:29.503 --> 02:03:30.837
No, no.

02:03:30.971 --> 02:03:31.938
No, no, no.

02:03:32.072 --> 02:03:33.339
You told me not to.

02:03:33.474 --> 02:03:35.041
I would never disobey you.

02:03:35.175 --> 02:03:37.478
Thank you for letting him
do this, Ray.

02:03:37.611 --> 02:03:39.513
Oh, I didn't do anything.
I just sat there.

02:03:39.646 --> 02:03:40.714
He did all the work.

02:03:40.847 --> 02:03:43.116
You liked going over the spine,
didn't ya?

02:03:43.249 --> 02:03:45.018
Took it like a champ.

02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:46.319
I sat there wincing.

02:03:46.453 --> 02:03:47.688
(chuckles)

02:03:52.158 --> 02:03:53.460
Oh, my God.

02:03:53.594 --> 02:03:55.061
Can we at least
close the curtain?

02:03:55.195 --> 02:03:57.297
-Oh. My guys. -Guys,
people die in here, all right?

02:03:57.430 --> 02:04:00.066
-My guys. My guys.
-Uh... -Aw, come on.

02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:02.636
Mom, I don't want to hug him.
He's not wearing a shirt.

02:04:02.769 --> 02:04:04.871
-Come on, you can handle it.
-Ah, dude, you're so smooth.

02:04:05.005 --> 02:04:06.973
You're-you're like a sea otter.

02:04:07.107 --> 02:04:08.341
-(Margie laughs)
-Please, we have to stop.

02:04:08.475 --> 02:04:09.610
We have to stop.
Please. Please.

02:04:09.743 --> 02:04:11.111
-Please stop? Please stop.
-(Margie chuckles)

02:04:11.244 --> 02:04:13.313
But first, you will get to Lord
and Lady Stark and you will...

02:04:13.446 --> 02:04:15.148
SCOTT: I hung out with,
like, Ray and the guys

02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:17.651
from the firehouse
the other night at the bar,

02:04:17.784 --> 02:04:20.220
and, um, they were just telling
all these stories about Dad.

02:04:20.353 --> 02:04:22.355
And there were stories
I never heard of before,

02:04:22.489 --> 02:04:25.058
like, you know, about him,
like, doing coke

02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:27.661
and being hilarious.

02:04:27.794 --> 02:04:28.862
-Yeah.
-You know?

02:04:28.995 --> 02:04:30.531
Yeah. Yeah.

02:04:32.533 --> 02:04:34.768
Well, he was hilarious.

02:04:34.901 --> 02:04:36.670
Yeah.

02:04:36.803 --> 02:04:38.204
Uh...

02:04:38.338 --> 02:04:42.008
He was also
out of control and crazy.

02:04:42.142 --> 02:04:44.911
-Do you understand?
-You can't. (grunts)

02:04:45.045 --> 02:04:46.913
Why-why didn't you just tell me?

02:04:47.047 --> 02:04:48.515
I don't know.

02:04:48.649 --> 02:04:51.051
I just-- I wanted you to have
some good memories

02:04:51.184 --> 02:04:52.385
to offset what happened.

02:04:52.519 --> 02:04:53.854
I didn't know what to-to say.

02:04:53.987 --> 02:04:57.257
Was I gonna say, "Your dad
really loved watching cartoons

02:04:57.390 --> 02:04:59.760
with you 'cause he was
tripping all the time"?

02:04:59.893 --> 02:05:01.595
-Yeah.
-(scoffs)

02:05:01.728 --> 02:05:04.230
Sounds like a good dad to me.

02:05:04.364 --> 02:05:05.566
No, you know what?

02:05:05.699 --> 02:05:07.400
Uh, I get it.

02:05:07.534 --> 02:05:12.806
Knowing that he had
his issues and... problems

02:05:12.939 --> 02:05:16.042
just like everybody else,
it makes me feel better.

02:05:16.176 --> 02:05:19.546
It really...
it really humanizes him.

02:05:20.681 --> 02:05:23.550
Well, he was a great guy.

02:05:23.684 --> 02:05:25.686
He was a very complicated guy.

02:05:27.688 --> 02:05:30.423
He had a really big heart.

02:05:30.557 --> 02:05:31.625
Mm.

02:05:31.758 --> 02:05:33.393

02:05:34.895 --> 02:05:36.630
Uh...

02:05:36.763 --> 02:05:38.965
Yeah, I guess, like Ray, yeah.

02:05:39.099 --> 02:05:40.400
Yeah.

02:05:40.533 --> 02:05:43.269
Yeah. (laughs)

Uh-huh.

02:05:49.375 --> 02:05:51.177

02:06:38.158 --> 02:06:41.027

get it together.

02:06:50.436 --> 02:06:52.839

Hey. How are you?

02:07:48.528 --> 02:07:50.630
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, I just, uh...

02:07:50.764 --> 02:07:52.298

my civil service test today.

Oh, yeah, I-I remembered.

02:07:55.869 --> 02:07:57.303
That's why I wanted to,
you know...

02:07:57.437 --> 02:07:58.972
-I have to go.
-Can I come?

02:07:59.105 --> 02:08:00.273
What? Why?

02:08:00.406 --> 02:08:02.208
