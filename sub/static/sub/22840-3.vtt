00:02.326 --> 00:04.043
Grand Wizzard Theodore is like...

00:05.775 --> 00:09.165
Oh, snap, I think
I just invented scratching.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.993
And Diana Ross was like,

00:12.061 --> 00:14.766
♪ I can sing! ♪

00:14.876 --> 00:16.055
And Berry Gordy was like,

00:16.123 --> 00:19.539
that vocal range
is supreme.

00:19.607 --> 00:20.842
And Nichelle Nichols was like,

00:20.910 --> 00:23.268
Captain, I have something
to communicate with you.

00:23.329 --> 00:24.484
Live long and prosper.

00:24.552 --> 00:26.068
I do this.
I go there.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.784
<i>Yeah,
that's the shocker.</i>

00:43.928 --> 00:45.685
So you just pop it like this,
yeah?

00:45.815 --> 00:46.938
Yes.

00:47.889 --> 00:49.985
See how strong I am,
Quest?

00:50.079 --> 00:52.040
Ah! Check, please.
Sorry.

00:52.108 --> 00:53.157
Yo, you just missed...

00:53.225 --> 00:56.448
- Oh... sorry, sorry, sorry... seconds.
- My day manager by, like,

00:56.586 --> 00:58.330
Party people in the place to be.

00:58.407 --> 01:01.396
My name is Questlove,
and I'm here to tell you

01:01.473 --> 01:04.446
about the birth of hip-hop culture.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.857
<i>Now, it's 1973,</i>

01:06.934 --> 01:09.390
<i>and Clive Campbell,</i> AKA Kool Herc,

01:09.467 --> 01:10.820
<i>born in Jamaica,</i>

01:10.897 --> 01:13.618
<i>has come to New York to
find a better opportunity.</i>

01:13.743 --> 01:16.383
- <i>And he's like,</i>
- Yo, I'm gonna be a big DJ.

01:16.460 --> 01:18.188
<i>So, he's playing soul music,</i>

01:18.266 --> 01:21.126
and there was always
a part in that song

01:21.229 --> 01:24.540
<i>where they would literally
give the drummer some,</i>

01:24.608 --> 01:26.247
<i>and that's called
"The Breakdown."</i>

01:26.316 --> 01:27.677
- The Breakdown.
- <i>So,</i>

01:27.745 --> 01:29.760
soon as James Brown
warns you

01:29.828 --> 01:31.254
that we 'bout to give the drummer some,

01:31.321 --> 01:33.880
<i>suddenly, the place
would go out their mind.</i>

01:33.948 --> 01:36.913
<i>Like...</i>

01:37.799 --> 01:39.750
<i>And then Kool Herc would
just be at the turn table,</i>

01:39.817 --> 01:41.134
- <i>like,</i>
- Yo, I got it.

01:41.212 --> 01:43.670
I'm gonna play only the
best part of the song,

01:43.756 --> 01:45.609
only the break,
and then move on,

01:45.677 --> 01:47.130
and then move on, and then move...

01:47.198 --> 01:49.692
<i>And then, his sister,
Cindy Campbell,</i>

01:49.760 --> 01:52.065
- <i>is like, hey, Herc...
- No.</i>

01:52.501 --> 01:53.931
<i>She was saying, hey, Clive,</i>

01:53.999 --> 01:57.247
<i>I want you to DJ
my back-to-school jam.</i>

01:57.315 --> 01:59.108
- <i>And Kool Herc is like,
- Yep.</i>

01:59.176 --> 02:01.928
<i>So, August 11, 1973,</i>

02:02.135 --> 02:03.756
<i>at this particular party,</i>

02:03.833 --> 02:06.554
<i>Kool Herc invented the
Merry-Go-Round theory.</i>

02:06.631 --> 02:08.382
<i>First of all, he was
using two turntables,</i>

02:08.459 --> 02:10.122
which was unheard of back then.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.304
- <i>And he's like,</i>
- Watch,

02:11.381 --> 02:13.460
<i>and he played those
11 seconds, the break.</i>

02:13.528 --> 02:15.448
<i>And then,
when that part was over,</i>

02:15.525 --> 02:17.259
<i>he'd fade it and then
go to the next song,</i>

02:17.327 --> 02:19.097
<i>using this other turntable.</i>

02:19.174 --> 02:21.911
<i>And the party was
spinning on their heads,</i>

02:21.988 --> 02:24.729
<i>spinning on their knees,
spinning on their backs,</i>

02:24.806 --> 02:26.573
<i>spinning on their noses.</i>

02:26.641 --> 02:28.925
<i>And Kool Herc is like...</i>

02:29.250 --> 02:30.639
<i>Sorry, I just feel like</i>

02:30.716 --> 02:32.840
<i>the Michael Jackson
"Smooth Criminal" lean,</i>

02:32.917 --> 02:34.184
<i>when it was about to happen.</i>

02:34.252 --> 02:35.282
Like that.

02:35.350 --> 02:36.427
That's what happening.

02:36.504 --> 02:40.139
Anyway, so, his... his claim
to fame was inventing hip-hop.

02:40.216 --> 02:41.471
Pretty good invention.

02:41.580 --> 02:43.974
<i>And then, in 1976,</i>

02:44.069 --> 02:46.516
<i>Joseph Saddler,
AKA Grandmaster Flash,</i>

02:46.584 --> 02:47.798
<i>would take a crayon</i>

02:47.875 --> 02:50.365
<i>and mark the point
where the break starts.</i>

02:50.433 --> 02:52.959
<i>And then one day,
he was just tired of doing that.</i>

02:53.027 --> 02:55.636
How can I take
the Merry-Go-Round theory

02:55.704 --> 02:56.838
and make it better?

02:56.906 --> 02:58.727
<i>And so,
he goes to Radio Shack,</i>

02:58.820 --> 03:02.505
- <i>and says,</i>
- I want a queuing system

03:02.574 --> 03:04.526
that will allow me to hear a record

03:04.594 --> 03:06.083
before the audience hears it.

03:06.151 --> 03:07.216
How can I do it?

03:07.284 --> 03:08.776
And they said,
are you out your mind?

03:08.844 --> 03:10.534
There's no way
that you can do it.

03:10.602 --> 03:13.090
And so, he's basically taking a razor

03:13.158 --> 03:16.081
and slicing... the chords

03:16.151 --> 03:19.535
and inserting the chords
into the back of the mixer.

03:19.603 --> 03:20.820
And, you know, everyone's like,

03:20.887 --> 03:22.308
no, no, no, you're
gonna destroy the system!

03:22.375 --> 03:24.128
You're gonna destroy the system!

03:24.205 --> 03:25.692
And he's like, no, I got this.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.314
<i>And with his scien...
scientific trickery,</i>

03:28.382 --> 03:30.359
he invented
the queuing system.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.133
Now, Flash is like,

03:32.210 --> 03:36.689
I'm able to take a four-bar
drum break...

03:38.702 --> 03:41.020
One, two, three, and extend it.

03:42.884 --> 03:45.402
He has two copies of the
same song.

03:47.490 --> 03:49.020
Damn. I'm so...

03:49.097 --> 03:51.042
dizzy right now, you just don't know.

03:51.119 --> 03:52.793
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Anyway...

03:52.870 --> 03:55.752
<i>So, Flash had an
apprentice named Mean Gene,</i>

03:55.829 --> 03:58.481
<i>and Mean Gene had a little brother</i>

03:58.549 --> 04:00.600
<i>named Theodore Livingston.</i>

04:00.668 --> 04:03.558
<i>So, Mean Gene, Theodore,
and Mama Livingston,</i>

04:03.755 --> 04:05.680
<i>all living in this apartment complex.</i>

04:05.757 --> 04:08.711
<i>Now, there was one rule for
young Theodore Livingston,</i>

04:08.788 --> 04:09.974
<i>and that rule was,</i>

04:10.051 --> 04:12.108
<i>don't touch our
equipment when we're gone.</i>

04:12.185 --> 04:13.308
<i>He's like, all right.</i>

04:13.385 --> 04:16.731
<i>Five, four... door shuts... three.</i>

04:18.721 --> 04:20.612
<i>Now, he's like, I'm 12 years old,</i>

04:20.713 --> 04:23.302
<i>but if it kills me,
I'm gonna be bigger than</i>

04:23.370 --> 04:25.591
<i>Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash.</i>

04:25.659 --> 04:27.333
<i>But, uh, Mama Livingston,</i>

04:27.401 --> 04:29.658
she just told him,
yo, just keep it down.

04:29.735 --> 04:31.276
<i>And he's like, sorry, Mom.</i>

04:31.354 --> 04:33.824
<i>But he, uh, started making a mixtape,</i>

04:33.901 --> 04:35.260
<i>and he was loud.</i>

04:36.854 --> 04:38.541
<i>And she bust in again.</i>

04:38.609 --> 04:40.346
I thought I told you to turn it down!

04:40.430 --> 04:43.053
<i>And he's... he puts his
hand on the turntable.</i>

04:43.130 --> 04:46.151
<i>And he's like, ah, man,
I'm gonna get it now.</i>

04:46.291 --> 04:47.912
But, here's the thing,

04:47.989 --> 04:49.815
<i>his mixtape that he was recording</i>

04:49.892 --> 04:51.216
was still recording.

04:51.293 --> 04:53.711
<i>But she startled him so much</i>

04:53.788 --> 04:55.470
<i>that he started shaking,</i>

04:57.317 --> 05:00.706
And then, he decides to stop the tape.

05:00.783 --> 05:02.670
<i>And he wanted to hear
the progress he did.</i>

05:02.747 --> 05:04.543
<i>So, at the point where
she's yelling at him,</i>

05:04.611 --> 05:05.736
<i>he had an epiphany.</i>

05:05.813 --> 05:07.616
He said, wait a minute,
you're meaning to tell me

05:07.683 --> 05:10.070
when I put my three
fingers on this record,

05:10.147 --> 05:11.549
and I do this...

05:12.742 --> 05:14.230
<i>it makes this weird noise?</i>

05:14.307 --> 05:15.696
<i>He's like, maybe it's a fluke,</i>

05:15.773 --> 05:17.322
<i>so then he gets another record.</i>

05:18.981 --> 05:20.889
<i>He says, yo, this sounds crisp.</i>

05:20.957 --> 05:22.340
<i>So I can do... I can go...</i>

05:24.634 --> 05:27.892
<i>Oh, snap, I think I
just invented scratching.</i>

05:27.969 --> 05:30.155
So, he had a Batman,

05:30.232 --> 05:32.316
"Wait till they get
a load of me" moment.

05:33.136 --> 05:35.822
So, he waits for this
perfect block party,

05:35.899 --> 05:39.652
<i>because he knew that he
had lightning in a bottle.</i>

05:39.909 --> 05:44.384
<i>And Flash, Herc, every DJ is there.</i>

05:44.461 --> 05:46.713
<i>I mean, he's... he has
to stand on a crate,</i>

05:46.790 --> 05:48.336
<i>in order to reach the turntable.</i>

05:48.413 --> 05:49.813
<i>That's how much of a kid he is.</i>

05:49.890 --> 05:52.312
<i>And he... it's just a
moment full of tension.</i>

05:52.389 --> 05:55.043
He just looks... looks at the stylus,

05:55.120 --> 05:56.403
and he goes...

06:03.778 --> 06:07.073
And the audience goes apeshit.

06:07.276 --> 06:09.702
He doesn't just extend
it like Flash does,

06:09.779 --> 06:11.168
like an extended loop.

06:11.245 --> 06:12.706
<i>He is like...</i>

06:16.939 --> 06:20.022
And people stop dancing,
and they just watch him.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.892
<i>And they never... that's the first time</i>

06:27.969 --> 06:29.791
<i>they ever heard scratching.</i>

06:29.868 --> 06:32.628
<i>And Grandmaster Flash is looking like,</i>

06:32.705 --> 06:34.949
what the hell was that?

06:35.026 --> 06:36.652
<i>And Kool Herc is like,</i>

06:36.729 --> 06:39.072
what the hell was that?

06:39.149 --> 06:43.616
<i>And Grand Wizzard Theodore
felt elated and justified,</i>

06:43.753 --> 06:47.541
<i>so he takes Kool Herc's
Merry-Go-Round theory,</i>

06:47.618 --> 06:50.787
<i>and he takes Flash's
Peek-A-Boo system</i>

06:50.864 --> 06:52.413
<i>of hearing records ahead of time,</i>

06:52.481 --> 06:54.877
<i>and then puts the perfect cherry on top,</i>

06:54.954 --> 06:57.167
<i>precise cutting and scratching,</i>

06:57.236 --> 06:59.631
<i>and that completes the final word</i>

06:59.716 --> 07:01.667
<i>of hip-hop DJing.</i>

07:02.248 --> 07:05.766
The art of turntableism

07:05.843 --> 07:09.234
is a beautiful invention.

07:09.311 --> 07:10.597
- Hm.
- I mean...

07:10.665 --> 07:13.324
the best babysitter
I ever had in my life

07:13.392 --> 07:15.651
was my dad's turntable.

07:16.874 --> 07:19.388
One, two, three, four.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.450
- This is called...
- Oh, that's nice.

07:29.527 --> 07:31.048
Extending the beat.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.313
One, two, three, four.

07:33.538 --> 07:34.709
Mm.

07:38.228 --> 07:39.662
Well, that was your
quasi-lesson.

07:39.747 --> 07:41.785
- I love that.
- This is math and science.

07:41.853 --> 07:43.348
- It is.
- It also reminds me of this.

07:43.425 --> 07:45.898
I'm gonna see if I... well,
I don't wanna school you,

07:45.975 --> 07:47.043
- but, uh...
- School me.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.549
Ta, ta, ti-ti, ta...

07:48.626 --> 07:49.562
Ta, ti-ti...

07:49.639 --> 07:51.376
What do you know about
ta and ti ti ta's?

07:51.453 --> 07:52.552
Rest...

07:57.080 --> 07:59.050
You just spoke my language.

08:03.546 --> 08:04.897
What's with that hat?

08:06.075 --> 08:08.570
This hat is...

08:08.804 --> 08:10.461
White Women hat,

08:10.624 --> 08:12.184
and it is my improv group,

08:12.252 --> 08:14.707
and we are seven
black gentlemen.

08:14.775 --> 08:16.218
- Okay.
- It's fun.

08:16.286 --> 08:17.585
Right.

08:17.676 --> 08:19.109
Greetings.

08:19.689 --> 08:21.179
I'm Carl Tart,

08:21.670 --> 08:24.780
and today
we're gonna talk about

08:25.031 --> 08:27.062
the man, the myth, the legend,

08:27.310 --> 08:29.226
Mr. Berry Gordy.

08:29.380 --> 08:32.842
<i>Our story begins
in Detroit, Michigan.</i>

08:32.957 --> 08:36.679
<i>And Berry Gordy got this
job at General Motors.</i>

08:36.756 --> 08:38.089
He would be on the assembly line,

08:38.166 --> 08:40.813
being like, ooh, I feel
the revving of the engine.

08:40.890 --> 08:42.465
It's, like, rhythmic.

08:46.761 --> 08:49.770
Like, these... the sounds
that these cars are making,

08:49.923 --> 08:52.010
it's like music to my ears.

08:52.267 --> 08:56.485
I got to be a music producer.

08:56.553 --> 08:58.184
- It's hitting me, Derek.
- It's okay.

08:58.252 --> 08:59.928
This liquor is hitting me
now.

08:59.996 --> 09:02.664
Anyway, so, Berry Gordy
bought this house,

09:02.732 --> 09:06.087
and he was so dope,
he called it Hitsville U.S.A.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.946
- Hitsville.
- Hitsville.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.599
He's like, this is where hits come from,

09:09.666 --> 09:11.563
in Detroit, Motor Town,

09:11.779 --> 09:15.064
- or as I like to say it, Motown.
- Motown.

09:15.132 --> 09:16.778
Ooh, that's what
we gotta call it.

09:16.855 --> 09:18.841
- Mm-hm.
- Ooh, that shit is dope.

09:18.918 --> 09:20.139
You like that?

09:20.207 --> 09:22.475
So, in 1960, all these people

09:22.553 --> 09:25.241
<i>from Mississippi and
Alabama and Texas,</i>

09:25.309 --> 09:26.636
<i>they go to Detroit,
where they can get a job</i>

09:26.703 --> 09:28.189
<i>at an auto place.</i>

09:28.257 --> 09:29.982
<i>You'd get off the bus and be like,</i>

09:30.137 --> 09:32.455
♪ Ooh, bah, doo, doo ♪

09:32.648 --> 09:35.769
♪ Bah, doo, doo, bah,
bah, bah, bah, bah, boom ♪

09:35.855 --> 09:37.844
<i>And because
of his experience at GM,</i>

09:37.912 --> 09:39.250
Berry was like, I'm gonna go get

09:39.318 --> 09:40.860
some of these kids off the street,

09:40.937 --> 09:42.594
and I'm gonna build an assembly line

09:42.671 --> 09:44.993
of people that can sing,
so here I go.

09:45.070 --> 09:47.146
And he was like, yo...

09:47.214 --> 09:48.605
Oh, shit, sorry.

09:48.768 --> 09:50.178
You're all good.

09:50.441 --> 09:51.434
It's in my ass now.

09:51.502 --> 09:52.587
I know.

09:52.655 --> 09:54.249
Get that ice cube out of your ass, Carl.

09:54.316 --> 09:56.337
Get that ice cube
out of your ass.

09:56.496 --> 09:59.101
Get that ice cube
out of your ass.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.429
Anyway, after that,
Berry Gordy was like,

10:04.581 --> 10:06.765
all right,
I need some women singers.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.842
Come on in here.
Let me hear you sing.

10:08.919 --> 10:09.879
And they were like...

10:09.956 --> 10:12.530
♪ I can sing ♪

10:12.800 --> 10:17.038
And he was like,
that vocal range is supreme.

10:17.288 --> 10:19.113
I'm gonna call y'all
The Supremes.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.275
So, The Supremes had
a lead singer.

10:21.343 --> 10:22.603
Her name was
Diana Ross.

10:22.671 --> 10:25.001
And Berry Gordy was like,
oh, shit,

10:25.078 --> 10:27.135
that's the woman I wanna
be with right there.

10:27.212 --> 10:29.812
I'm in love with you, Diana Ross.

10:29.882 --> 10:31.076
I want us to be together.

10:31.176 --> 10:33.566
And she was like, no,
I'm not in love with you back.

10:33.643 --> 10:36.929
You not my type. You ugly.
I'm not into you.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.759
And he was like, all right,
that's fine,

10:38.827 --> 10:41.124
we can keep
this relationship working.

10:41.964 --> 10:44.862
So
A part of this assembly line

10:44.962 --> 10:47.288
during the building
process of these artists.

10:47.356 --> 10:48.401
And Berry Gordy was like,

10:48.469 --> 10:51.285
I need Maxine Powell
and Charlie Atkins,

10:51.362 --> 10:54.330
the etiquette coach
and the dance teacher.

10:54.398 --> 10:55.648
And Maxine was like,

10:55.741 --> 10:57.351
I'm the most classy woman
in the world.

10:57.428 --> 10:58.905
I'm Maxine Powell.

10:58.973 --> 11:00.848
Look how
I hold my long cigarette.

11:00.916 --> 11:03.157
Listen,
white people got tight butts,

11:03.225 --> 11:04.577
and it's the '60s.

11:04.695 --> 11:06.999
Y'all need to have tight
butts like white people.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.516
And so, they all
tightened their butts up,

11:08.583 --> 11:09.619
and they squeezed them.

11:09.696 --> 11:12.452
And Charlie Atkins was
like, yeah, tight butts,

11:12.548 --> 11:14.572
but we also gotta
teach you how to dance.

11:14.649 --> 11:15.851
A-five, six, seven, eight.

11:15.919 --> 11:17.610
And they would do
all this dope stuff.

11:17.694 --> 11:20.023
And they became these superstars

11:20.091 --> 11:21.163
across the world.

11:21.260 --> 11:23.163
They go to London,
tight butts.

11:23.231 --> 11:24.905
America, tight butts.

11:25.014 --> 11:27.030
Canada, tight butts.

11:27.745 --> 11:31.015
So in the 1960s,
Berry "Gorda" get...

11:31.104 --> 11:32.624
Berry "Gorda."

11:33.167 --> 11:34.773
Abe Vigoda.

11:34.968 --> 11:37.702
Berry Gordy was pushing
out all these artists.

11:37.854 --> 11:40.195
And he'd be like,
I got The Temptations,

11:40.263 --> 11:41.685
I got The Supremes;

11:41.759 --> 11:43.279
I got Marvin Gaye;

11:43.404 --> 11:45.461
I got Martha Reeves and the Vandellas;

11:45.608 --> 11:47.140
I got The Contours;

11:47.208 --> 11:48.630
I got Stevie Wonder.

11:48.813 --> 11:50.504
Stevie Wonder can't see shit,

11:50.581 --> 11:53.070
but his music is dope.

11:53.138 --> 11:56.741
And so from 1965 to 1968,

11:56.873 --> 12:00.795
Motown had $15 million in sales.

12:00.872 --> 12:03.626
And they desegregated music.

12:03.703 --> 12:06.894
Motown was like, we bringing
our black asses up in here.

12:06.971 --> 12:10.521
Killin' the game.
Motown, we here.

12:10.606 --> 12:12.296
But Berry did love Diana Ross,

12:12.498 --> 12:15.452
and he loved her so much
that he took her to Paris.

12:15.529 --> 12:16.955
So they went up to the hotel,

12:17.032 --> 12:20.519
and she was like, okay,
well, I'm wooed by this.

12:20.596 --> 12:22.915
I'm a woman
of my own means.

12:23.070 --> 12:24.580
I'ma let you hit it.

12:24.648 --> 12:26.827
I'ma let you smash.
And Berry was like, for real?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.558
She was like, yes, I'm
gonna let you smash.

12:28.625 --> 12:30.843
Let's get in the bed. And
Berry's getting into bed.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.577
He has all these thoughts in his head,

12:32.654 --> 12:34.688
and his head is like, this
is the best moment of my life.

12:34.755 --> 12:37.240
This is bigger than
when I started Motown.

12:37.317 --> 12:38.776
I'm about to smash Diana Ross.

12:38.886 --> 12:40.862
I've been wanting to
do this for a long time.

12:41.058 --> 12:42.948
But then, he was like,

12:43.112 --> 12:44.801
I can't... I can't get it up.

12:45.018 --> 12:46.639
I can't get it up.
My dick's not working.

12:46.716 --> 12:49.200
And it's the '60s.
There's no Viagra yet.

12:49.277 --> 12:51.836
And he looked at her.
He was like, Diana, no!

12:51.913 --> 12:53.863
Not right now. My dick ain't hard.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.253
And she was like, all right,
that's fine, all right?

12:56.321 --> 12:57.361
I like you now,

12:57.438 --> 12:58.912
so you ain't gotta get it up tonight.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.433
But we in Paris...

13:00.603 --> 13:02.901
so let's go get some baguettes

13:03.072 --> 13:05.268
and eat at the Moulin Rouge,

13:05.369 --> 13:07.542
'cause those are Paris things, you see.

13:07.939 --> 13:10.784
And they ended up smashing
for a bunch of years.

13:10.852 --> 13:12.087
Wow.

13:12.248 --> 13:14.735
But, eventually, in 1988,

13:14.945 --> 13:16.633
Berry Gordy was like,
I'm done with this.

13:16.710 --> 13:18.181
I can't run this record label no more.

13:18.249 --> 13:19.657
None of... all my artists is gone.

13:19.725 --> 13:20.992
- Damn.
- And then, somebody was like,

13:21.060 --> 13:23.664
hey, I'll buy it for $61 million.

13:23.741 --> 13:25.893
And Berry Gordy was like, hell yeah.

13:25.961 --> 13:28.555
And then, he went on to retire.

13:28.709 --> 13:30.531
He's just an old ass man,

13:30.753 --> 13:33.047
86 years old sitting on the beach,

13:33.226 --> 13:35.891
buying stuff on Amazon.

13:36.540 --> 13:39.445
R&B music binds cultures,

13:39.564 --> 13:42.022
<i>and I commend Berry
Gordy for starting that.</i>

13:42.099 --> 13:44.651
<i>What he did was take these artists,</i>

13:44.728 --> 13:47.053
and he said, hey, this
is what people wanna hear.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.320
Like, everybody likes rap.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.856
Everybody likes R&B,

13:50.941 --> 13:53.742
and Berry Gordy's the
father of all that stuff.

13:53.810 --> 13:55.695
Berry Gordy, I'll cheers to that.

13:55.763 --> 13:56.867
Berry Gordy...

13:56.935 --> 13:58.703
I got nothing to cheers to.

14:04.983 --> 14:06.204
No.

14:06.281 --> 14:07.637
Live long and prosper.

14:07.714 --> 14:08.743
All right, you're gonna teach me.

14:08.810 --> 14:10.727
- You have all your fingers together...
- I do.

14:10.795 --> 14:12.978
And then, you just go like this.

14:14.126 --> 14:15.320
Stay together.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.492
Put them all together.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.666
Okay.

14:17.743 --> 14:19.563
- And then, just...
- I do this.

14:19.631 --> 14:20.825
- I go there.
- No, that's...

14:20.893 --> 14:22.563
that's the shocker.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.252
Hi, I'm Ashley Nicole Black,

14:25.320 --> 14:27.742
and today we're talking
about Nichelle Nichols.

14:28.251 --> 14:31.805
So it's 1964,

14:31.933 --> 14:34.719
and Nichelle Nichols
guest stars

14:34.851 --> 14:37.309
on an episode of a show
called "The Lieutenant,"

14:37.377 --> 14:38.930
that's run by
Gene Roddenberry.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.871
And Gene Roddenberry was like,

14:40.995 --> 14:43.172
you're amazing;
you're so beautiful.

14:43.318 --> 14:45.930
Do you wanna be on this
new show called "Star Trek"?

14:45.998 --> 14:46.987
Here's my plan.

14:47.055 --> 14:49.240
It's gonna be super utopian,

14:49.308 --> 14:51.495
and black ladies can be bosses,

14:51.563 --> 14:53.056
so this is exactly a really big deal.

14:53.124 --> 14:55.946
So Nichelle Nichols is like,
that sounds chill as hell,

14:56.014 --> 14:57.203
so let's do that show.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.921
So they start filming "Star Trek,"

15:00.128 --> 15:02.648
and Nichelle Nichols
plays Lieutenant Uhura,

15:02.716 --> 15:04.907
who's the communications
officer, so she's like,

15:04.975 --> 15:07.099
Captain, I have something
to communicate with you.

15:07.193 --> 15:08.484
Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.

15:08.552 --> 15:11.070
And she has nails that
are way too long for space.

15:11.138 --> 15:12.256
But also...

15:12.324 --> 15:15.115
Nichelle Nichols doesn't
actually watch the show,

15:15.183 --> 15:18.195
because back then,
TV came on at a certain time,

15:18.263 --> 15:20.056
and she was at work
during that time.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.737
So at the end of the first season,

15:21.805 --> 15:23.229
she's like, "Star
Trek" is cool, whatever.

15:23.296 --> 15:24.548
I don't know if anybody watches it.

15:24.615 --> 15:26.769
But my dream
is to be on Broadway.

15:26.837 --> 15:28.586
I wanna sing.
I wanna dance.

15:28.654 --> 15:30.010
And she goes to Gene Roddenberry,

15:30.078 --> 15:31.805
and she's like, hey,
I'm gonna go to Broadway,

15:31.872 --> 15:34.225
so I'm done Trekking.
I'm done.

15:34.293 --> 15:36.745
So, he tells her, like,
please,

15:36.813 --> 15:38.703
just, like, take the
weekend to think about it.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.825
And she was like, whatever, bitch, fine.

15:40.948 --> 15:42.300
So that weekend,

15:42.416 --> 15:45.305
Nichelle Nichols goes
to an NAACP fundraiser,

15:45.460 --> 15:47.751
and one of the organizers
comes up to her,

15:47.819 --> 15:49.937
and is like, hey, there's a guy here,

15:50.005 --> 15:51.195
and he's your biggest fan,

15:51.263 --> 15:52.532
and he really wants to meet you.

15:52.599 --> 15:54.536
And she's like, okay, cool, whatever.

15:54.613 --> 15:55.734
Bring on the nerd.

15:55.811 --> 15:57.531
And she sees her fan,

15:57.602 --> 16:00.694
and he's like, your
show is the only show

16:00.780 --> 16:02.498
that I allow
my three little children

16:02.575 --> 16:03.726
to stay up and watch.

16:03.803 --> 16:05.610
We love "Star Trek."
It's so good.

16:05.678 --> 16:09.392
And she's like, excuse me,
are you Martin Luther King?

16:09.460 --> 16:12.565
And he's like, yes,
I am Martin Luther King,

16:12.633 --> 16:13.959
and I'm a Trekkie.

16:14.036 --> 16:16.327
And she's like, fuck me.

16:16.817 --> 16:17.913
But it's real.

16:18.147 --> 16:20.816
Martin Luther King loved "Star Trek."

16:20.893 --> 16:21.894
And he's like,

16:21.971 --> 16:24.626
you are the only black
woman on television

16:24.694 --> 16:26.210
who doesn't play a servant.

16:26.311 --> 16:29.095
You're the only person
out there providing hope

16:29.163 --> 16:31.103
to black people
that there's a future,

16:31.171 --> 16:33.368
where maybe they won't
be seen as less than,

16:33.436 --> 16:34.899
and they'll be seen as equals.

16:34.967 --> 16:37.220
And she's like, wow, that's great,

16:37.288 --> 16:39.673
except for I'm leaving.

16:39.741 --> 16:41.751
I quit "Star Trek"
this week. I'm so sorry.

16:41.819 --> 16:44.670
And he's like,
no, you can't quit.

16:44.747 --> 16:45.840
Do you realize that you are

16:45.917 --> 16:47.438
the first black "women" who's...

16:47.515 --> 16:48.874
black woman.

16:49.085 --> 16:51.473
He wasn't drunk
when he said it.

16:51.541 --> 16:53.116
- No, it's okay.
- I was drunk.

16:53.311 --> 16:55.626
But Martin Luther King
was like, if you leave,

16:55.694 --> 16:57.571
this one image that
children have

16:57.639 --> 16:59.139
of a black woman as an equal

16:59.207 --> 17:00.938
will just disappear
from television.

17:01.006 --> 17:04.142
And she's like, well,
fuck, that's a lot.

17:04.210 --> 17:05.428
That's, like, a lot.

17:05.538 --> 17:07.109
That's a lot on my shoulders.

17:07.178 --> 17:08.915
Can you chill?
And he's like,

17:08.983 --> 17:10.962
No, I'm Martin Luther
King. I have no chill.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.358
And she was like, okay,
I'll think about it.

17:13.928 --> 17:16.056
Stay tuned
for more "Drunk History."

17:16.124 --> 17:18.095
Do you know how the
first interracial kiss

17:18.163 --> 17:19.845
on television happened?

17:25.338 --> 17:28.138
So Nichelle Nichols goes
into Gene Roddenberry's office

17:28.207 --> 17:29.506
and she's like, Gene,

17:29.596 --> 17:31.556
I met Martin Luther King
this weekend,

17:31.624 --> 17:33.280
and he really likes your shit.

17:33.348 --> 17:35.437
And he's like,
oh, my God...

17:36.100 --> 17:39.108
Someone understands what
I'm trying to do here.

17:39.230 --> 17:41.030
She's like,
oh, my God, shut the fuck up.

17:41.098 --> 17:43.538
That's not the point.
The point is, this show

17:43.606 --> 17:45.991
is going to
advance racial equality.

17:46.059 --> 17:47.385
I'll stay on your show.

17:47.497 --> 17:50.293
So, you know, they're
filming "Star Wars."

17:50.362 --> 17:51.603
- It's great.
- Is that true?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.057
Oh, my God.

17:55.525 --> 17:57.179
Also very good.

17:57.248 --> 18:00.358
So they're doing "Star Trek."

18:00.470 --> 18:02.202
It's great. People love it.

18:02.547 --> 18:04.369
At some point,
Gene Roddenberry's like,

18:04.501 --> 18:06.226
I know...
we're gonna push the envelope.

18:06.303 --> 18:08.655
We're gonna have the
first interracial kiss.

18:08.723 --> 18:10.874
And William Shatner is like,
hell yes.

18:10.942 --> 18:13.230
And Nichelle Nichols
is like, whatever, fine.

18:13.298 --> 18:15.835
But the network came down
and was like, whoa, hold on,

18:15.944 --> 18:17.620
we can't have
an interracial kiss on TV.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.817
So William Shatner
convinces them,

18:19.894 --> 18:21.264
let's shoot it both ways.

18:21.332 --> 18:23.131
We'll shoot it with the kiss first,

18:23.221 --> 18:24.307
and then, we'll shoot it without,

18:24.374 --> 18:26.803
and you can decide what
you wanna do in editing.

18:27.736 --> 18:30.327
So they shoot
the scene with the kiss,

18:30.420 --> 18:32.510
and then, he's like,
you know what, I have a note.

18:32.587 --> 18:34.831
Let's try it again.
Let's try it again.

18:34.908 --> 18:36.275
Let's do it one more time.

18:36.352 --> 18:38.506
And they shoot it
over and over

18:38.583 --> 18:39.903
and over again.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.789
And they're like, William,
enough kissing, okay?

18:42.866 --> 18:44.940
We only have time to
shoot this one more time.

18:45.017 --> 18:47.501
And he's like, okay,
let's just do one without the kiss.

18:47.578 --> 18:49.195
So it isn't until the next day

18:49.272 --> 18:51.433
that they watch the scene
and see that William Shatner

18:51.510 --> 18:54.210
crosses his eyes to the camera.

18:54.791 --> 18:56.138
And they're like, what the fuck,

18:56.206 --> 18:57.525
is this really happening?

18:57.602 --> 18:59.548
And William Shatner was like,
I guess we either

18:59.616 --> 19:01.470
have to air this interracial kiss

19:01.538 --> 19:03.217
or not have a scene.

19:03.319 --> 19:05.031
And that is how the
first interracial kiss

19:05.108 --> 19:06.616
- gets on television.
- Wow.

19:06.684 --> 19:09.838
And then, in 1969,
America lands on the Moon.

19:09.936 --> 19:11.263
And everyone in America's
like, oh, my God,

19:11.330 --> 19:13.038
we landed on the Moon.
It's amazing.

19:13.106 --> 19:14.785
And Nichelle was like, uh, hold up,

19:14.907 --> 19:16.061
that's all white dudes.

19:16.195 --> 19:17.502
What the fuck, right?

19:17.579 --> 19:18.950
So she gives this big speech,

19:19.027 --> 19:21.979
and she's like, NASA,
get your shit together.

19:22.056 --> 19:24.810
Can you please recruit
someone to be an astronaut

19:24.887 --> 19:25.907
who's not a white dude?

19:25.984 --> 19:29.577
And NASA's like, okay, cool,
but, like, can you do it?

19:29.645 --> 19:32.827
'Cause we don't know anybody
who's not a white dude.

19:32.911 --> 19:34.577
So Nichelle Nichols was like,

19:34.645 --> 19:37.327
ugh,
black ladies have to do everything.

19:37.411 --> 19:39.135
So she travels
around the country,

19:39.212 --> 19:40.615
and she recruits people
to be in NASA,

19:40.682 --> 19:42.030
and she's like,
hey, black people,

19:42.098 --> 19:44.538
Asians, lady people,
do you wanna go to space?

19:44.784 --> 19:46.187
And they're like, okay, cool.

19:46.255 --> 19:47.743
And she recruited Sally Ride.

19:47.876 --> 19:50.494
And then,
she recruits Colonel Bluford.

19:50.571 --> 19:52.863
He was the first black
dude to be in NASA.

19:52.940 --> 19:53.866
How cool is that?

19:53.943 --> 19:56.158
And then,
she recruited Mae Jemison.

19:56.235 --> 19:58.661
And she was like, hey,
you should apply for NASA.

19:58.738 --> 20:00.821
And Mae Jemison is like,
oh, my God,

20:00.967 --> 20:02.658
you were on "Star Trek."
I love you.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.569
But she's like,
pay attention.

20:04.798 --> 20:06.428
So Nichelle Nichols was, like,

20:06.496 --> 20:08.735
the first black lady
to go to space for fake,

20:08.803 --> 20:10.452
and she recruited
the first black lady

20:10.529 --> 20:11.685
to go to space for real.

20:11.762 --> 20:14.272
She literally integrated space.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.764
Everybody who's really
good at math,

20:17.849 --> 20:19.717
or whatever you have to be
good at

20:19.788 --> 20:21.511
to be... go to NASA,

20:21.647 --> 20:23.163
can do whatever
they wanna do.

20:23.364 --> 20:25.996
But we still need to
prosper

20:26.064 --> 20:27.358
if we're gonna live long.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.288
- Yeah.
- Is this America right now?

20:29.356 --> 20:31.238
- That's trying so hard, but...
- Yes.

20:31.328 --> 20:33.321
- But it can't get over...
- But its ring finger

20:33.389 --> 20:34.960
just can't deal with it.

20:37.167 --> 20:40.371
