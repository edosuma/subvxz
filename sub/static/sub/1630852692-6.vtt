WEBVTT

00:07.633 --> 00:09.969
The eastern faction
was wiped out by giants.

00:09.969 --> 00:13.556
Then we need to make
our next move count.

00:13.556 --> 00:16.600
Gather every able-bodied fighter
in Whitestone.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.316
Bryn.

00:24.316 --> 00:26.360
Thank the Dawnfather
you're alive.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.445
What news do you bring?

00:27.445 --> 00:29.530
The Briarwoods have moved
the Kestrel.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.490
She's with Professor Anders.

00:31.490 --> 00:32.575
Anders?

00:32.575 --> 00:34.410
She'll be hard to extract.

00:42.418 --> 00:43.419
They have us.

00:43.419 --> 00:46.088
Run!

00:54.722 --> 00:56.390
They're in here!

00:56.390 --> 00:57.808
Break it down!

00:57.808 --> 01:00.144
I'll take the guards!
Get out of here!

01:05.608 --> 01:07.693
No!

01:09.737 --> 01:13.574
You're a tenacious
little tick, Archibald.

01:15.409 --> 01:19.079
Gonna have fun
burnin' you off my balls.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.124
The Briarwoods know we've come.

02:45.124 --> 02:48.294
W-We should
cut them down.

02:48.294 --> 02:49.295
No.

02:50.462 --> 02:53.048
The Sun Tree's
obviously being watched.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.056
Quickly. This way.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.601
Are you crazy?

03:03.601 --> 03:05.311
Out of the streets. Hide!

03:07.354 --> 03:09.148
We got to move.

03:20.451 --> 03:23.162
Grog, you're part giant.
Can you vouch for us?

03:23.162 --> 03:25.664
Oh, what, 'cause we
all fucking know each other?

03:25.664 --> 03:27.875
Well, I mean,
yeah, kinda.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.669
Why do you wear this?

03:30.669 --> 03:32.671
A-Are you part
of the resistance?

03:32.671 --> 03:34.673
Uh, sorry, I-I don't follow.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.175
The de Rolo crest.

03:36.175 --> 03:37.885
Maybe the resistance
is using it.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.304
We're not with them,
but we do share an enemy.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.642
Whitestone is worse off
than I expected.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.602
Briarwoods are dicks.

03:46.602 --> 03:49.021
Perhaps we can be of use
to each other.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.440
Tell me,
is Keeper Yennen still alive?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.275
Why do you want to know?

03:53.275 --> 03:54.777
If you want change here,

03:54.777 --> 03:57.613
Yennen is the only one
who can help bring it.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.490
Hmm.

04:00.783 --> 04:04.536
Friends, I know
you have suffered.

04:04.536 --> 04:08.374
My heart weeps and my back
breaks under the weight

04:08.374 --> 04:10.209
of these past few years.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.544
But anger makes us reckless.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.713
Violence doesn't burn away
the clouds.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.549
It only makes more smoke.

04:17.549 --> 04:21.303
Have faith and wait for a sign.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.764
A new dawn is coming, friends.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.183
And soon we will bask
in its glory,

04:26.183 --> 04:28.268
together.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.486
Take care, young one.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.703
Greetings, strangers.

04:45.703 --> 04:49.331
We don't see many new faces
these days.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.417
Keeper Yennen, tell me,

04:51.417 --> 04:53.794
what do the Briarwoods make
of your sermons?

04:53.794 --> 04:56.380
They don't attend my services.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.800
But their Pale Guard
tolerate me, for now.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.553
You truly believe
the Dawnfather will send a sign?

05:03.595 --> 05:06.473
Shh.
That name is forbidden.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.768
It's you.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.521
Oh, but you're not the same.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.523
Little Percival,

05:14.523 --> 05:16.066
what have you become?

05:16.066 --> 05:19.361
I am what they made me.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.572
What matters is
that you're back.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.073
I'm not back.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.034
I'm only here for one thing.

05:25.034 --> 05:26.952
Then you want
what the people want.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.538
A trusted de Rolo can lead them
to freedom.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.749
They'll listen
to the rightful heir.

05:31.749 --> 05:34.877
What I need to do
requires discretion.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.628
Groups can be messy.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.380
But you're leading this group.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.007
No offense, Percy,

05:40.007 --> 05:42.468
but you're a teeny bit
too wittle to lead.

05:42.468 --> 05:43.969
Wait, we have
a height requirement?

05:43.969 --> 05:45.387
Uh, obviously.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.723
W... I-I thought we were
all sort of co-leaders.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.935
Follow me.

06:17.086 --> 06:18.295
We're clear.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.925
Hey, I'm a huge fan of taverns,

06:22.925 --> 06:24.843
but this place
kind of looks like shit.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.595
Looks can be deceiving.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.642
No, it's, uh...

06:31.642 --> 06:33.143
it's shitty on the inside, too.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.020
- An old resistance hideout.
- Hmm?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.939
We can speak freely here.

06:38.690 --> 06:42.653
Wait.

06:42.653 --> 06:44.446
No. Oh, gods, no.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.032
What is this hell?!

06:47.032 --> 06:50.285
Thanks to the Briarwoods,
all our resources are dwindling.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.162
- Huh?
- Including ale.

06:52.162 --> 06:56.291
I will fucking murder everyone!

06:56.291 --> 06:59.545
You preach pacifism
while associating with rebels.

06:59.545 --> 07:03.173
Trust me, I want the Briarwoods
gone as much as you do.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.716
But I've seen uprisings fail,

07:04.716 --> 07:07.302
and if you charge up
to that castle,

07:07.302 --> 07:09.221
you'll be slaughtered.

07:09.221 --> 07:13.725
No. The only way to win is if
the resistance is strong enough.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.812
And the resistance
isn't strong enough because...?

07:16.812 --> 07:18.355
Their leader has been captured.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.023
Ah, there it is.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.359
He's set to be hanged tomorrow.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.944
Percy,

07:23.944 --> 07:25.737
it's Archibald Desnay.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.323
Archie? But how?

07:28.323 --> 07:30.951
We... we grew up together.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.619
His father worked
in the kitchen.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.788
We'd raise hell
all over the castle.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.290
One time,

07:36.290 --> 07:38.125
- Archie and I built...
- Roots of the Sun Tree.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.543
...the most disgusting
stink bomb in history.

07:39.543 --> 07:40.794
Ruined a state dinner.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.380
Even formed an alliance
against my broth...

07:44.798 --> 07:48.135
You're telling me that hellion
is a resistance leader?

07:48.135 --> 07:51.096
You're not the only one
who has changed, Percival.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.099
Can you hear me?

07:54.099 --> 07:56.768
I'm Keyleth of the Ashari.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.271
You can't take
the Briarwoods alone.

07:59.271 --> 08:02.774
Free Archie
and the resistance will follow.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.110
You're playing on my emotions.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.070
And I can't say I blame you.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.488
We'd be starting an uprising.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.699
And this town
could use some hope.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.659
It's certainly not
the worst idea we've had.

08:15.871 --> 08:18.373
"Scanlan the Revolutionary"
has a nice ring to it.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.125
Ooh! I could get a beret!

08:20.125 --> 08:22.044
We'd need a lot of luck.

08:22.044 --> 08:24.046
What you need is faith.

08:24.046 --> 08:27.174
At the moment,
our holy person is...

08:27.174 --> 08:29.051
<i>elsewhere.</i>

08:30.219 --> 08:31.470
Everlight?

08:32.930 --> 08:34.598
Hear me.

08:34.598 --> 08:36.141
Please.

08:36.141 --> 08:37.434
Hear me!

08:41.188 --> 08:42.272
No.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.149
No, no, no, no.

08:51.907 --> 08:54.326
It's no use.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.124
Lady Briarwood's curse, it...

09:01.124 --> 09:03.919
it isn't letting me contact
the Everlight.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.588
My child,

09:06.588 --> 09:10.342
no curse, no spell could sever
your connection to her light.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.927
It's impossible.

09:11.927 --> 09:16.640
Whatever is blocking you
is inside of you.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.059
But...

09:19.059 --> 09:21.144
you're saying...

09:21.144 --> 09:23.188
it's not a curse?

09:23.188 --> 09:25.732
It's... me?

09:37.703 --> 09:40.038
The idea of you mangy lot

09:40.038 --> 09:43.542
thinking you're heroes
of some grand story.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.876
Gah.

09:44.876 --> 09:47.546
There's no room for heroes
in Whitestone.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.466
Your rebellion's a mess.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.552
We know all about your spy,

09:53.552 --> 09:55.470
the Kestrel.

09:55.470 --> 09:59.850
Now, tell me where I can find
the rest of you louts.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.477
You're not very good at this.

10:04.313 --> 10:07.816
If you won't take me seriously,

10:07.816 --> 10:10.152
meet the Duke.

10:10.152 --> 10:13.030
He's as serious as they come,
mate.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.908
I do hope you and I can engage

10:16.908 --> 10:19.244
in a stimulating conversation.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.497
Because you'll find
the alternative to be

10:22.497 --> 10:25.876
most disagreeable.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.879
<i></i>

10:32.132 --> 10:33.717
Yennen's sources tell us

10:33.717 --> 10:35.552
- Archie is, um...
- Hmm. Ah...

10:35.552 --> 10:37.304
Grog, give me that.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.306
Is being held here.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.684
Okay, so here's my idea
how to bust Archie out.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.603
<i>I'll speak to the local animals.</i>

10:44.603 --> 10:45.937
<i>- They'll fetch the jailer's keys</i>

10:45.937 --> 10:47.314
<i>and free our friends.</i>

10:47.314 --> 10:49.399
Eh, not so fast,
fair maiden.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.736
<i>This is a job
for Scanlan the Revolutionary.</i>

10:52.736 --> 10:54.654
I infiltrate the prison

10:54.654 --> 10:55.947
<i>with all these potions I found.</i>

10:55.947 --> 10:57.282
<i>I don't know what they do yet,</i>

10:57.282 --> 10:58.950
<i>but let's assume
they make me a...</i>

11:00.619 --> 11:02.204
<i>...one-man army.</i>

11:02.204 --> 11:04.039
You think too much.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.124
<i>All we got to do is...</i>

11:06.124 --> 11:08.377
<i>kill everyone and leave.</i>

11:08.377 --> 11:10.462
Uh, what about Archie?

11:10.462 --> 11:11.713
Right.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.632
<i>Yeah, we kill him, too.</i>

11:13.632 --> 11:16.134
- Hmm.
- Huh?

11:16.134 --> 11:19.137
Those were bad ideas
and you should all feel bad.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.224
I don't know. Scanlan's
solo mission sounds interesting.

11:22.224 --> 11:24.101
His failure
would be spectacular.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.644
Okay, no elaborate plans.

11:25.644 --> 11:28.480
Get in, get out. Strike
like a well-thrown dagger.

11:28.480 --> 11:32.234
- I can get behind that.
- But if we're going to get Archie out of that prison,

11:32.234 --> 11:34.653
we need to know exactly where
they're holding him.

11:34.653 --> 11:37.697
I may have something
that can assist.

11:40.742 --> 11:45.497
I shan't waste your time,
as I have but the one question.

11:45.497 --> 11:48.375
Where is Vox Machina?

11:49.918 --> 11:53.004
What's a Vox Machina?

12:03.932 --> 12:06.518
Vedmire, what the hell, mate?

12:06.518 --> 12:08.228
If I wanted him dead,

12:08.228 --> 12:10.647
I would've got a giant
to stomp his head.

12:10.647 --> 12:14.651
Breaking an individual
takes time, Stonefell.

12:14.651 --> 12:17.028
I've only just begun.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.698
Send for me when this one wakes.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.876
Got you.

12:32.878 --> 12:35.380
East wing. Second floor.

12:35.380 --> 12:39.885
- Uh... what is that thing?
- This?

12:39.885 --> 12:42.345
Oh, nothing but bad news.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.725
Okay,
this is how it's going down.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.895
<i>It'll be easier to avoid capture
if we split into two teams.</i>

12:51.771 --> 12:55.066
<i>Front door team
and back door team.</i>

12:55.066 --> 12:56.693
You know Scandog's
all about the back door.

12:56.693 --> 13:00.113
<i>when has
splitting the party ever worked?</i>

13:00.113 --> 13:01.740
Uh,
since shut the fuck up.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.283
Mm-hmm, okay,
fair counterpoint.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.498
- Yoo-hoo.
- Hmm?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.710
- Mwah.
- Oh, hello.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.671
Hmm.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.715
And Archie's rebels
will keep a lookout

13:18.715 --> 13:20.967
<i>while we get him out of there.</i>

13:20.967 --> 13:23.970
Hope the back door team
doesn't get there first.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.639
Hmm.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.018
Almost.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.353
Damn.

13:31.353 --> 13:32.687
I've almost got... Shit.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.607
Ah, wait, I've got it now...
Fuck, shit, fuck.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.485
- Are you kidding me?
- Fucking doors.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.121
Huh?

13:50.121 --> 13:52.582
- Vex?
- Keep moving.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.459
We can't just leave them.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.713
Fine.

14:00.715 --> 14:04.386
Congrats. Everyone's getting out
early for bad behavior.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.810
Ah! Oh, my fingers.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.187
It's not a door.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.273
It's a thing of evil.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.692
I'm going to find a window.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.449
Someone's coming.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.163
What are you doing?

14:32.163 --> 14:34.291
You're supposed to be watching
the front door.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.585
We came for a fight.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.424
Don't move!

14:44.384 --> 14:46.052
Well, here's your chance.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.346
We found them!

14:48.346 --> 14:50.015
Get off.

14:50.015 --> 14:51.349
Hold on. You'll get us caught,
Scanlan.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.226
- I'm gonna kick it down. G-G-Gah...
- No. No.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.359

So, what do we do now?

15:10.118 --> 15:11.995
Uh...

15:15.957 --> 15:17.667
Ah. Ah... ew.

Upstairs.

15:33.308 --> 15:36.144
Thank the gods.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.854
Wait, what's this crowd?

15:40.106 --> 15:42.067
Picked it up along the way.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.943
Why are you covered in piss?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.737
Picked it up along the way.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.289
Archie.

Archibald.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.295
Percy?

16:02.295 --> 16:04.506
Vax, get him out of there.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.675
Ah, right.

16:06.675 --> 16:09.386
Okay,
here we go.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.388
Did you see that?

16:11.388 --> 16:13.473
I'm telling you
that back door was cursed.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.559
Shit, is this the afterlife?

16:16.559 --> 16:18.144
We're not dead yet, friend.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.356
All right.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.441
We're getting out of here
together.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.323
I'll give you this, girly.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.287
You'll at least die together.

16:39.749 --> 16:43.795
Throw down your arms,
return to your cells,

16:43.795 --> 16:46.005
and maybe I'll let you live.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.552
Kill the gnome.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.179
No, no, no,
I'm too handsome to die.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.514
Huh?

16:56.349 --> 16:59.144
What's a guy got to do
to get some action around here?

16:59.144 --> 17:01.229
Scanlan?

17:07.277 --> 17:09.362
Don't just stand there!
Get him!

17:15.201 --> 17:19.247
For Whitestone!

17:36.765 --> 17:38.975
Go on. Get him out of here.

17:50.445 --> 17:52.238
Huh?

17:54.949 --> 17:57.243
I've got you, little one.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.706
Huh?

18:07.796 --> 18:09.672
No!

18:39.994 --> 18:42.247
Fun's over.
Where's our exit?

18:42.247 --> 18:44.582
Not this way.
There are guards everywhere.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.793
Percy, let me go.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.211
What are you doing?

18:48.211 --> 18:50.213
Just like the old days,

18:50.213 --> 18:53.007
creating a diversion
while you get away.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.051
You fucking dobbers!

Let me try.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.737
Hmm?

19:22.328 --> 19:24.664
You two, seal the doors.

Hmm?

Percy, wait!

We'll get him.

What are you supposed to be,
freak?

I am vengeance for the de Rolos.

20:14.672 --> 20:17.508
The de Rolos?

20:17.508 --> 20:19.302
Now that takes me back.

20:19.302 --> 20:22.639
Some folks you kill

Stonefell helped slaughter them
