(male narrator)
Previously on
Childrens Hospital.

00:03.504 --> 00:04.938
It's my brother.
He looks just like me.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.874
Don't see him coming here
any time soon to take advantage

00:06.939 --> 00:09.743
of my guilt over leaving home
for his own financial gain.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.145
[men groan]

00:11.212 --> 00:13.181
Wait. This form is
different than this form.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.949
Actually, Dori, the correct
usage is "different from."

00:16.015 --> 00:18.852
This form is different
from this form.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.055
It's just a common
grammatical error.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.390
Oh, okay. Thanks.

00:22.456 --> 00:25.393
And from is an
anagram of form.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.064
[sigh]

00:36.404 --> 00:38.772
[grunts]

00:38.839 --> 00:40.674
[theme music]

00:42.576 --> 00:44.545
(male announcer)
'Attention!
Fish is my favorite dish.'

00:44.612 --> 00:46.547
[thinking]
I've been around.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.982
And I've worked at a lot
of children's hospitals.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.784
They're all the same.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.986
Everyone has their
role to play.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.389
You've got the cool doctors.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.858
You've got the nerds.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.493
The jocks.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.895
The Goths, and of course..

01:01.962 --> 01:03.431
...the clowns.

01:03.497 --> 01:04.532
Blake.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.633
Blake.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.635
[scoffs]
Blake?

01:07.701 --> 01:10.104
No, no. I'm not Blake.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.207
I'm his brother.
Sir Tinkle Button.

01:14.842 --> 01:18.011
And you are an angel.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.348
[squeaking]

01:20.414 --> 01:22.850
[instrumental music]

01:31.392 --> 01:33.561
In order to increase revenue

01:33.627 --> 01:36.230
we have made part
of the hospital

01:36.297 --> 01:38.266
into a youth hostel.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.969
[all booing]

01:42.035 --> 01:43.971
Wait, guys.
It was actually my idea.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.006
[all cheering]

01:46.073 --> 01:47.975
(Sy)
'I'm positive it was my idea.'

01:48.041 --> 01:49.009
[all booing]

01:49.076 --> 01:50.344
Dropping off.

01:50.411 --> 01:53.481
Hey, what's going on
over here?

01:53.547 --> 01:55.916
Nothing.
I was just walking by.

01:55.983 --> 01:59.187
I saw this kid out in the
parking lot with a broken arm.

01:59.253 --> 02:02.556
So, I did the right thing and
brought him to the hospital.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.526
Hope he'll be okay.
Bye now.

02:06.927 --> 02:10.698
That was Daffy Giraffy.
The mascot of Ride World.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.066
- Can we please move on?
- Hold on a second.

02:13.133 --> 02:17.271
I'm not taking the word of a
creepy guy in a giraffe outfit.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.273
Hey, what's up your
butt-hole, Owen?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.509
Okay, we get a fun visit
from Daffy Giraffy.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.811
And you're like,
"Hold on a second."

02:23.877 --> 02:27.014
[talks gibberish]

02:27.080 --> 02:29.016
That's not
what I said.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.719
Hey, little man.
How'd you hurt your arm?

02:31.785 --> 02:33.587
I was..

02:34.322 --> 02:35.789
[dramatic music]

02:37.225 --> 02:39.560
I was playing in the parking lot
and fell.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.696
See, he fell. I mean,
what's up with you, man?

02:42.763 --> 02:44.698
All you see is evil
and darkness.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.268
We see a giraffe
with a human face

02:47.335 --> 02:50.604
in its neck helping out
a boy in need.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.541
Excuse me.
Where are the showers?

02:53.607 --> 02:55.743
Put 'em on morphine.
That'll be funny.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.545
You're a monster.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.080
What is this?
No. Dudes, dudes, dudes.

03:00.147 --> 03:03.217
You can't park your bikes here.
This is a working hospital.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.786
- Your Wi-Fi sucks.
- We don't have Wi-Fi.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.588
That's why it sucks.

03:07.655 --> 03:10.291
Take it to a World Wide Web
cafe. Go.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.660
Smells like a Spin Doctors
concert in here.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.863
You guys stink by the way.
You stink.

03:15.929 --> 03:20.701
(male announcer)
Attention! Baba Booey,
Baba Booey, that's all.

03:20.768 --> 03:21.735
Excuse me.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.771
Can you do help
for me sleep bed?

03:23.837 --> 03:27.608
It's $20 a room with $25
for the one with no fumes.

03:27.675 --> 03:31.479
[crying]
I lost all money on train.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.714
Sweet American can help?

03:33.781 --> 03:37.451
Okay. Okay, you know what,
for one night. For one night.

03:37.518 --> 03:40.388
Have somebody look at her.
It's not my specialty.

03:45.593 --> 03:49.463
[slow instrumental music]

03:58.539 --> 03:59.907
[both exclaiming]

03:59.973 --> 04:01.074
[both laughing]

04:01.141 --> 04:04.845
[whooping]

04:04.912 --> 04:07.781
Hey, is this a mirror?

04:07.848 --> 04:09.583
'Oh, no, it's not.'

04:09.650 --> 04:12.052
- Sir Tinkle Button.
- Mr. Bo Jiggles.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.788
No. No one calls me that here.
It's Blake.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.224
- How'd you find me?
- How did I find you?

04:17.291 --> 04:20.293
You're my brother.
We're like magnets. Family.

04:20.361 --> 04:23.096
I know in the past
I've said some things and..

04:23.163 --> 04:24.698
I just--

04:24.765 --> 04:26.734
[coughing]

04:26.800 --> 04:29.803
Wow! Cough sounds
expensive to fix.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.540
I-i-it's nothing.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.242
Come on. Let's take a break.
Do some clown stuff.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.412
- I don't know.
- Come on, honkey.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.781
Let's go.

04:40.848 --> 04:41.915
[both laugh]

04:41.982 --> 04:44.017
[upbeat music]

04:44.084 --> 04:45.986
[laughing]

04:50.157 --> 04:51.759
[ripping]

04:55.095 --> 04:56.797
Magic time!

04:56.864 --> 04:58.131
[shrieks]

04:58.198 --> 04:59.166
[laughing]

04:59.232 --> 05:00.701
(both)
Ooh!

05:02.970 --> 05:04.304
[both laughing]

05:06.707 --> 05:09.610
Oh, man, that was fun.
Haven't done that in forever.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.045
I told you it's like riding
a really tall bike

05:12.112 --> 05:14.515
with a huge front wheel.
You never forget how.

05:14.582 --> 05:17.951
But...I'm not a clown anymore,
I'm a doctor.

05:18.018 --> 05:18.986
Oh, no.

05:19.052 --> 05:22.255
No, you are...a clown.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.492
You will always
be a clown.

05:24.558 --> 05:27.027
- Have some pride in your race.
- I heal people.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.898
Then heal them with laughter,
not with...medicine.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.667
I can do both.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.669
I'm dying.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.473
[dramatic music]

05:41.909 --> 05:46.013
Dropping off.
Two more broken arms.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.548
Thank you, Daffy Giraffy.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.983
Well, well, well.
You again.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.753
Wanted to make sure
these boys are okay.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.589
Ah, we were playing in
the parking lot and we fell.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.791
- That's all.
- Okay.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.231
Um, am I the only one that
thinks something suspicious

06:04.297 --> 06:06.299
is going on over
at Ride World?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.769
There's a new ride called
the wacky-yacky arm buster.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.804
'It's like you're on
an African safari.'

06:10.871 --> 06:13.441
Then they drop you 10 feet
onto your right arm.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.709
Mm, not for me,
I get dizzy.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.945
That's it,
the ride is unsafe.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.848
And these stupid kids, go over
there and they get hurt.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.750
'Then Daffy Giraffy
drops them off'

06:22.816 --> 06:24.885
so Ride World isn't liable
for their injuries.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.120
It says right here,
that the ride is safe.

06:27.187 --> 06:31.291
Owen, were you abused by
a costume character as a child?

06:31.358 --> 06:34.061
Get a shrink.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.263
There a procedure,
it's expensive.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.065
It costs 15 G's.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.867
I'm a doctor,
I'll do it.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.903
No, the only doctor who
can do it is Dr. Knuckles.

06:42.970 --> 06:43.871
What?

06:43.937 --> 06:45.873
Dr. Knuckles
isn't accredited.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.108
He plays a bad doctor
in a circus.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.710
Here we go again.

06:49.777 --> 06:52.079
His nurse is a dog
in a costume.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.781
You're a sell out.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.983
You're a Ronald McDonald
paint job.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.586
Hey. I like the P word.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.754
You think these tanned faces
treat you like me?

07:00.821 --> 07:03.223
They don't. And I'll
tell you one thing.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.358
I'm your brother
and I'm dying.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.160
If you're not gonna help me

07:07.227 --> 07:09.530
let me go and find
another clown person.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.532
A real clown person

07:11.599 --> 07:13.734
to help a colored
brother out.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.671
[dramatic music]

07:27.981 --> 07:30.050
It's all there.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.492
You better not be
screwing me.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.729
- Are you talking to me?
- Ha...no.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.532
Said something
under my breath.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.534
God, this nurse
is such an idiot.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.736
I heard that too.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.745
[screaming]

07:57.811 --> 08:01.915
Give me your money, kid.
Come on, give me the cash.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.684
Help, help!

08:03.751 --> 08:05.786
Ow, you just broke my arm.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.989
Quit whining. Come on, punk,
give me the money.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.924
Well, well, well,
what do you know?

08:10.991 --> 08:12.760
- 'Ow!'
- 'Nobody can hear you here.'

08:12.826 --> 08:15.963
- Please.
- Okay.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.599
I'll give you my passport.
You'll send it right back?

08:18.666 --> 08:20.233
- 'Yes.'
- 'You promise?'

08:20.300 --> 08:21.334
'Umm-hmm.'

08:21.401 --> 08:23.336
- Dropping off.
- That's him.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.773
Daffy Giraffy, you're under
arrest for seven counts

08:25.839 --> 08:28.776
of assault petty thefts and
falsifying medical information.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.478
Oh, wait a minute.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.480
Yes, it's true.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.982
I did what the officer
described.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.784
But I had to.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.921
I work day and night at
Ride World for minimum wage

08:40.988 --> 08:42.389
no benefits.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.125
Just to scrape together
something to put on the table

08:45.192 --> 08:47.861
for my, for my
four kids at home.

08:47.928 --> 08:51.665
Marny, Lenor,
Sheera and Steven.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.868
Their mom left us,
28 months ago and..

08:54.935 --> 08:58.105
Well, we're just not
making ends meet.

08:58.171 --> 09:03.043
Society spits...on costume
characters like me.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.580
'And forces us to turn
to a life of petty crime.'

09:06.647 --> 09:09.282
So go ahead, officer.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.218
Handcuff me, take me away.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.654
But make sure to charge
me with the crime

09:13.721 --> 09:15.455
of caring about my family.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.926
The after-mentioned Marny
Lenor, Sheera and Steven.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.494
Wait, officer.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.632
On behalf of all
of the kids parents

09:24.698 --> 09:26.667
I'd like to formally
drop all charges.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.870
God be with you,
Daffy Giraffy.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.840
Well, looks like
you're free to go.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.075
Hey, buddy. Hope this helps
you and your family.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.711
- It's 15 G's.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:37.778 --> 09:41.114
Then how are you gonna pay
for your surgery?

09:41.181 --> 09:43.483
I don't know.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.285
I don't know.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.958
Oh, crap, okay.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.226
Good thing I went to
the bank today.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.628
Thank you.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.733
[thinking]
I guess it doesn't matter
if you're cool, a nerd

09:59.800 --> 10:01.735
jock, Goth or clown.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.536
Underneath it all,
we're people.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.807
And sometimes, you have
to make a bet on others.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.942
What's the over-under
on people?

10:09.009 --> 10:11.578
If you ask me,
it's faith.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.380
Got your 15 G's.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.217
- What's the action on the game?
- It's over, Calves lost.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.853
I'm feeling pretty lucky.
Why don't we double or nothing?

10:19.920 --> 10:22.189
- On the Calves.
- I said it's over, they lost.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.524
Looks like someone's afraid
to make a bet.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.227
You wanna make a bet?
Whatever.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.063
You lost.
Now you owe us 30 G's.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.134
- Let's go.
- No worries.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.336
Think I just found
my gravy train.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.878
[theme music]

10:46.914 --> 10:50.217
(female announcing)
'Attention, can Dick Hertz
please report to surgery.'

10:50.283 --> 10:52.686
'Dick Hertz, hey,
wait a minute.'

10:52.753 --> 10:55.723
'Dick Hertz is on vacation.'

11:01.762 --> 11:02.963
Go.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.936
What do you keep looking at?

11:10.470 --> 11:11.805
[music continues]
