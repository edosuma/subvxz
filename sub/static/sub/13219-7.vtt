-Ah!

00:09.110 --> 00:09.541
You okay?

00:09.543 --> 00:12.111
You rented us this place
to scare away our neighbors?

00:12.113 --> 00:12.811
No. I did you a favor.

00:12.813 --> 00:16.248
People on your block
can't stand the idea
of a negro neighbor.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.383
Well, here's the good news.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.618
If you choose to stay,
it'll be rent-free.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.687
I'm serious about
being a great cop.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.389
'Til Priore rises
from the near-dead,

00:23.391 --> 00:25.524
I'm acting LT.
So what do you got?

00:25.526 --> 00:26.558
I think she's covering.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.426
Let me talk to him, find out.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.461
Let the detectives handle
their case, all right?

00:29.463 --> 00:31.163
You already did
your part, sweetie.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.331
Wash that out for me.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.766
All I care about is Walt.

00:33.768 --> 00:35.367
I just want to talk to my son.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.235
I don't know
where Walt went.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.337
I'm worried he might
do something crazy.

00:38.339 --> 00:39.905
SAM: Peace offering.

00:40.875 --> 00:41.974
OPAL: You know, you can stay.

00:41.976 --> 00:44.443
Aren't you expecting Cutler?

00:45.246 --> 00:47.646
Detective Hodiak, huh?

00:47.648 --> 00:48.213
I brought you something.

00:48.215 --> 00:51.316

00:53.254 --> 00:54.019
<i> You can be afraid.</i>

00:54.021 --> 00:58.190
<i> Or you can be the thing</i>

-(GUN COCKING)
-Turn around, slow...

02:15.069 --> 02:17.302
Big man.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.372
And drop me that piece
while you're at it.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.450
(CHUCKLES)

02:31.452 --> 02:32.518
Well...

02:32.520 --> 02:34.186
I guess I'll get that later.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.387
Listen, whatever it is
you want,

02:35.389 --> 02:38.757
whatever your situation,
we can solve this, you and me.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.792
Solve it? Yeah.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.828
Is this a riddle?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.430
What's your name, man?

02:45.432 --> 02:46.398
Me?

02:46.400 --> 02:48.500
Oh, I'm Jesus Christ.

02:48.502 --> 02:48.934
Son of man.

02:48.936 --> 02:51.537
Listen, this is a mistake.
You don't know who I am.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.206
Well, I know who you're not.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.874
And I'm disappointed,

02:55.876 --> 03:00.479
but I'm working with
the situation at hand, friend.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.382
Now strip.

03:05.052 --> 03:08.187
Shirt, pants. Off.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.121
Wait a minute, you...

03:09.123 --> 03:11.890
Ah, keep the volume
down while you do it.

03:11.892 --> 03:18.030
We don't wanna disturb
your creamy little piece
of cake in there, now, do we?

03:43.824 --> 03:46.491
Now, turn around.
On your knees.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.528
I'm a cop.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.264
Are you now?

03:56.670 --> 03:58.637
Think about this.

03:58.639 --> 04:04.243
What you do is gonna be
done to you 10 times over.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.419
Down, big dog.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.721
Down.

MORAN: So, okay...

04:40.247 --> 04:42.014
About done.

04:42.016 --> 04:44.349
Sorry, Cut, this is, uh...

04:44.351 --> 04:47.819
Never taken a statement
like this from,
you know, one of us.

04:47.821 --> 04:48.387
It's a little, uh...

04:48.389 --> 04:50.289
CUTLER: It's not your fault
the call came in.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.356
You're just
following protocol.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.991
Let's just get it
over with, all right?

04:52.993 --> 04:56.128
Okay. Uh, brown hair,
brown eyes,

04:56.130 --> 04:58.563
shortish, greasy hair,
moccasins?

04:58.565 --> 05:00.832
I know, it's half the
so-called men in LA.

05:00.834 --> 05:04.603
I'm telling you,
he's just some
drugged-up hippie freak.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.041
So Hodiak know?

05:09.276 --> 05:11.443
Come on, Moran. Yeah.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.712
Jeanie know?

05:15.516 --> 05:17.616
Okay. Okay.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.319
So anything to add?

05:20.321 --> 05:22.688
Yeah. Keep it under your hat.

SADIE:
You're gonna love Mother Mary.

05:30.064 --> 05:32.297
So who is she, just one of us?

05:32.299 --> 05:35.500
No. The first of us.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.702
When Charlie
got out of prison,

05:36.704 --> 05:39.171
he heard it was all love
in San Francisco,

05:39.173 --> 05:42.040
and pow,
instant thunderstorm.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.942
They were meant to meet.
She took care of him.

05:43.944 --> 05:48.246
And then when he
found me and the others,
she took care of all of us.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.448
So why isn't she with us?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.216
She has a real job. But...

05:51.218 --> 05:54.052
Now it's time to come home.

05:59.093 --> 06:01.259
(ENGINE STARTING)

06:03.630 --> 06:05.263
Jimbo, you lost weight.

06:05.265 --> 06:05.697
Small ask?

06:05.699 --> 06:08.333
Any chance it'll wipe out
what I owe you from poker?

06:08.335 --> 06:11.002
Three hundred
and sixty-six bucks?

06:11.004 --> 06:13.071
It might, actually.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.673
I'm all yours, Detective.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.842
FBI liaison.
How's that going?

06:16.844 --> 06:19.144
Oh, they're a shiny
parade of ass-clench.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.547
Who are deep in
the antiwar demonstrators.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.216
What they got you on,
follow and photo?

06:24.218 --> 06:26.918
Yeah. They're not much
for the actual work.

06:26.920 --> 06:27.219
Right.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.989
Well, I need you to get me
whatever you got before you
funnel it to them, all right?

06:30.991 --> 06:33.358
On this guy
named Robbie Arthur?
You know this guy?

06:33.360 --> 06:34.726
Oh, yeah.
A squirrelly little munchbag.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.729
Uh-huh.
I wanna know where he goes,
who he talks to,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.364
pretty much 24-7 if you can.

06:39.366 --> 06:42.167
Anything I should be
on the lookout for?

06:43.604 --> 06:45.170

06:45.172 --> 06:46.605
Him.

-No questions, Jimbo.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.477
-TULLY: Sam.
-Yeah.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.813
What is this, a gag?

06:54.815 --> 06:56.681
No. Cutler's there.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.618
No doubt in
full hair and makeup.

07:07.161 --> 07:09.327

No, I never heard anything.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.630
I never saw anything.
I'm sorry.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.800
But you cleaned his
dressing room every night?

07:14.902 --> 07:15.901
Every night.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.302
(SNIFFLES)
But I get to it last.

07:17.304 --> 07:21.907
It's all the way in back,
behind Miss Ball's offices.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.842
And by the time I got there...

07:23.844 --> 07:25.310

Who would do that?

Was Raymond Novo murdered?

07:30.984 --> 07:34.519
-Is his body still inside?

statement for you in an hour.

07:53.474 --> 07:54.206
-Half hour.
-Half hour.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.242
We'll call the <i> Times</i> together,
then we'll get on the horn
with his publicist.

till we get a picture
with him, okay?

07:59.847 --> 08:01.813
SAM: Hey, hey, you gonna ask
for an autograph, too?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.615
Oh, yeah, Sam,
'cause you're so above it.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.484
You got fast as me
when the call came in.

08:05.486 --> 08:08.553
Or do you just like the girls
with the spangly pants?

08:08.555 --> 08:11.623
Ah, the business of show.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.662
Every one of
these guys crucial?

08:17.664 --> 08:18.830
CUTLER: Come on.
Guy was a star.

08:18.832 --> 08:22.267
SAM:
I'm not sure that rubs off
once you're dead.

08:23.370 --> 08:24.803
Hmm...

08:24.805 --> 08:26.571
Religious?

08:26.573 --> 08:29.407
CUTLER:
Well, funny you should ask.

08:37.251 --> 08:38.950
(WHISTLES)

08:39.553 --> 08:41.486
Someone was religious.

09:04.611 --> 09:07.646
(STUTTERS) I don't...
I don't understand.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.815
He... He's in there?
Raymond?

09:15.756 --> 09:21.026
I need to ask you
a few questions to
help with our investigation.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.260
Um...

09:22.262 --> 09:25.597
-You were the girlfriend of...
-Fiancee.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.669
I, uh, I just got
off the phone with
Mr. Novo's manager.

09:30.671 --> 09:34.806
He's on his way over.
Says he also happens
to manage you.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.107
Yes.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.810
How old are you, Miss Jens?

09:38.912 --> 09:40.545
I'm 23.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.048
And Raymond was...

09:43.417 --> 09:45.483
I... I don't know.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.153
Forty-six,
according to his studio bio,

09:48.155 --> 09:51.823
and 51, according to
his driver's license.

09:51.825 --> 09:58.163
His real name is... Was...
Esteban Novarro.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.331
Mexican.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.232
(SNIFFLES)
Yes.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.903
Can you think of anybody
that might want to harm him?

10:04.905 --> 10:06.037
No.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.806
No, never.

10:08.742 --> 10:12.277
What about the suite?
He spend a lot of time here?

10:12.279 --> 10:13.712
Whenever he was shooting here.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.480
So you must be
pretty familiar with it.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.849
Uh, no, no.
Raymond was a gentleman.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.150
Oh, no, no. I don't mean that.

10:19.152 --> 10:23.154
I just need to determine
if anything was taken, stolen.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.522
Oh.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.490
Oh, um...

10:25.492 --> 10:28.893
He, uh, he kept...
He kept watches
and things here.

10:28.895 --> 10:32.430
He had...
He had his gold watch
and his ring.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.668
The ring is gone.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.670
What kind of ring?

10:39.206 --> 10:41.039
Um, it was a...
A ruby ring.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.842
He got it when he went
to Rome with his mom.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.710
He treasured it.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.779
-This ring?
-Yeah.

10:48.382 --> 10:50.715
They killed him for a ring?

10:51.018 --> 10:53.018
I just...

11:03.764 --> 11:08.166

so excited to see me,
she'll probably cry.

really knew.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.601
It's been months.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.837
Mary, we miss you.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.106
Does he know?

11:48.542 --> 11:51.443
Is it his? Are you sure?

11:52.713 --> 11:53.344
Yeah.

11:53.346 --> 11:56.781
Uh, he'll just be
surprised is all.

11:56.783 --> 12:01.352
He keeps saying
that he's missing you,
and now we know why.

12:01.455 --> 12:03.421
He must have sensed it.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.423
He said he missed me?

12:05.425 --> 12:06.324
SADIE: Of course.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.960
We talk about Momma
all the time.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.762
Right, Cherry?

We talk about momma
all the time.

Constantly, yeah.

How is Charlie?

12:22.709 --> 12:24.109
He's good.

12:24.111 --> 12:27.045
But he's not the same
without you.

Okay.

12:32.486 --> 12:34.285
Let me pack a bag.

12:34.654 --> 12:38.256
Oh! And Charlie said
you have some sort of,

12:38.258 --> 12:40.391
I don't know, stock bond thing

12:40.393 --> 12:44.095
and that he wants you to
bring the note from the bank
with you.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.663
He needs it.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.932
Right.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.069
Right. Okay.

You're pretty.

SAM: I'm sorry, Father,
I know they're not pleasant.

13:10.056 --> 13:15.193
What I'm wondering is
do you think this is
kind of a specific message?

13:15.195 --> 13:18.029
Well, he's crucified.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.266
I... I hate to say it,
but I see

things as bad as this
all the time.

I'm trying to determine
if this is a deeply,

13:27.207 --> 13:28.807
explicitly Catholic thing,
you think?

13:28.809 --> 13:32.677
Or maybe just a violence thing
that happens
to look really Catholic.

does it say to me...
-"Sunday school crazy"?

13:38.718 --> 13:39.250
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

13:39.252 --> 13:42.220
Well, it's not
a very good crucifixion,
as they go.

There's more to it than nails.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.425
Right. Crown of thorns.
Spear in the side.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.695
What about
the spilled wine here?
Could that mean something?

13:50.697 --> 13:52.630
PRIEST: I suppose it could.
Blood of the Christ.

13:52.632 --> 13:57.235
But, to be fair, it looks like
there's been a brawl.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.037
Yeah. Yeah.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.572
I wish I could be more help.

14:00.574 --> 14:03.942
No, Father,
eliminating theories
is helpful.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.711
-Thank you for coming in.
-Anytime.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.113
It's good to see you.

14:09.115 --> 14:12.483
-It's nice to see you.
-I wish you'd come to church.

14:12.853 --> 14:16.688
You called,
my first thought was,
you're coming back.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.891
Ah...

14:21.361 --> 14:22.660
I know.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.096
Your life.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.265
I worry about you.

14:28.869 --> 14:29.901
I'm okay, Father.

14:29.903 --> 14:33.104
I've always worried about
the path you've taken...

14:33.106 --> 14:35.373
To try and make
sense of it all.

14:35.375 --> 14:39.143
Well, it's similar in a way
to the path you took, Father.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.845
-I worry about you.
-(CHUCKLES)

14:40.847 --> 14:43.581
I knew your heart
as a boy, Samson.

14:43.583 --> 14:48.553
It was maybe
a little too brave,
a little too caring.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.156
Tough combination.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.131
Hearts don't change.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.200
Guard yours.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.868
It's a good one.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.770
Thank you, Father.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.651
You might wanna work
on that face, Charmain.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.286
Sorry. What?

15:21.288 --> 15:23.421
Poker face.
You look disgusted.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.323
Well, it's an arm
with a nail through it.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.926
And you're a policewoman,
right?

15:28.028 --> 15:29.227
Right. Thank you.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.230
What are you doing right now,
aside from hovering?

15:32.232 --> 15:34.432
Cutler has me filing.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.869
Care to dip a toe in this?

15:38.171 --> 15:38.569
Yes.

15:38.571 --> 15:42.840
So I'm beginning to think
that it looks this way
because someone

15:42.842 --> 15:45.944
was really very angry
with Raymond Novo.

15:45.946 --> 15:49.314
You mean stage a crucifixion?
Because it looks like
a crucifixion.

15:49.316 --> 15:53.117
Suffice it to say that he must
have offended someone a tad.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.919
And you want me to...

15:54.921 --> 15:55.720
Uh, double-check
cold case files.

15:55.722 --> 16:00.758
See if I've forgotten any
religious fetishistic type
murders in the past two years,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.894
as if that's possible.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.762
Look into this.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.798
It's a common nail.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.132
Oh, you're good.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.701
I didn't say it was
gonna be easy.

16:09.703 --> 16:12.303
It's an avenue.
Could lead to premeditation.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.139
We're walking it.
"We" meaning you.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.176
I know it's not as much fun
as dressing up
for Halloween...

16:18.178 --> 16:20.311
-Oh, no, I want to.
-Yeah. All right.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.813
I'll, uh,
I'll work on it right away.

16:21.815 --> 16:27.051
Whatever "it" is
better not get in the way
of filing that right away.

16:27.287 --> 16:27.719
It won't.

16:27.721 --> 16:30.321
Quit getting
her hopes up, Sam.
It's cruel, I mean...

16:30.323 --> 16:35.893
Look, you're not
the next him, sweetheart,
so I'd lose the puppy look.

16:35.895 --> 16:40.798
It's heartbreaking
to those of us
who understand real life.

16:47.507 --> 16:51.109
Lieutenant Gilbert keeps
calling from Narco
for updates, so, um...

16:51.111 --> 16:54.612
I got a lot of seeds planted.
The mafia, Straight Satans...

16:54.614 --> 16:55.546
I'm watching
the Peach Pussycat,

16:55.548 --> 16:58.416
and I'm in with some
pretty suspicious freaks
at this hippie house.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.119
And we can close in
on which of those?

17:01.121 --> 17:02.420
None... Yet.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.654
But it's all connected.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.989
You weave a tangled web.

17:04.991 --> 17:05.723
It's heroin, man.

17:05.725 --> 17:09.193
Yeah, that you're not
within a mile of, man.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.529
Look...

17:12.232 --> 17:14.832
-Supposed to be me?
-Oh, no. This...

17:14.834 --> 17:15.800
Is Mr. Druggie.

17:15.802 --> 17:19.103
Mr. Druggie wants to
import wholesale, sell retail,

17:19.105 --> 17:21.539
and live in a big house
next to Hugh Hefner.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.608
-Now, you see this leg?
-Mm-hmm.

17:23.610 --> 17:24.642
That is Gladner.

17:24.644 --> 17:28.179
-Oh.
-Gladner. Well,
he's dead, right?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.081
Bye, leg.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.183
I'm gonna take out Marvin.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.453
Lucille, Vickery and Roy.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.321
Gee, who told you I like it
when there's pictures?

17:37.323 --> 17:42.393
But take away all those cats,
and Mr. Druggie's
still going strong.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.861
Until...

17:47.567 --> 17:49.133
Guapo.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.369
That's what I'm working at.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.537
Well, thanks for that.

17:52.539 --> 17:57.108
I feel I understand crime
a lot better now.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.543
Yeah, well, then
stop acting like you don't.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.779
No, I'm acting like a guy
who's seen a case or two.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.414
This don't smell
like it's close.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.216
It don't even smell
like it's cooking.

18:05.218 --> 18:09.921
And you, such as you are,
are a resource
and I need to allocate you.

18:09.923 --> 18:14.492
You didn't put me on this.
You can't pull me off it.
Lieutenant Gilbert in Narco...

18:14.494 --> 18:16.594
Says it's my call.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.231
Oops.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.197
You lost, sweetheart?

18:53.199 --> 18:55.700
They're filming
<i> For the Love of the City</i>
on, uh, Stage-8.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.236
-Oh, I'm not...
-Where are your go-go boots,
angel, huh?

18:58.238 --> 19:01.873
I mean, the sexy cop dancers
are wearing those patent
leather boots.

19:01.875 --> 19:05.209
My favorite part
of the costume, truth be told.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.344
Stan Roarke.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.513
I work directly with
the head of the studio.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.015
-Legal counsel?
-How'd you know?

19:11.017 --> 19:12.850
The suit, tie, shoes.

19:12.852 --> 19:15.686
-I deal with a lot of lawyers.
-Do you?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.688
I deal with
a lot of actresses...

19:17.690 --> 19:20.424
Some of whom go on
to become famous.

19:20.426 --> 19:23.694
Perhaps you'd like to deal
with me a little later?

19:23.696 --> 19:25.129
Oh, I just might.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.565
As part of an ongoing
homicide investigation.

19:27.567 --> 19:31.369
I may need to question you,
your clients, etcetera.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.304
You're a real cop?

19:33.306 --> 19:34.939
Last I checked.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.974
Why the hell would you
become a cop?

19:36.976 --> 19:38.910
Because I get to tell
gentlemen like yourself

19:38.912 --> 19:40.678
that you're standing in
a potential crime scene,

19:40.680 --> 19:44.615
so I'm gonna need you to step
away until further notice.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.784
And I enjoy that.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.153
Nice to meet you, Stan.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.281
They sell them
at every hardware store,
for the record,

20:17.283 --> 20:19.317
but I just thought
it was right there,

20:19.319 --> 20:21.953
just outside
the dressing room.
Maybe someone just...

20:21.955 --> 20:23.821
Just grabbed it
right before or during.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.723
-Seems more likely.
-It is more likely.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.459
I'll talk to lot security,
see what they have to say.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.762
I'll go fish, you go fish.
We'll go fishing.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.166
Well, here's what
I don't get, Bert.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.535
So you're at the guard gate
at 10:00 PM.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.403
Novo drives back onto the lot.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.906
Yeah, he was sometimes
here at night.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.474
Shooting?

20:43.943 --> 20:46.744
Yeah, see, because the office
got in touch with me,

20:46.746 --> 20:48.913
the production office
it's called,

20:48.915 --> 20:51.616
and they gave me
this schedule.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.049
The call sheet.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.485
No, this is more like
a plan for shooting scenes.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.321
-It's a call sheet.
-No, that would be
a record of phone calls.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.724
It's what time
you're called to work.

20:59.726 --> 21:00.825
Actors and crew. Call sheet.

21:00.827 --> 21:05.930
That's confusing.
Anyway, according to
the call sheet here,

21:05.932 --> 21:08.699
Novo, on the day
he was killed,

21:08.701 --> 21:11.369
was "called" at, uh, 6:00 AM.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.071
And then he was
"wrapped" at 6:00...

21:14.073 --> 21:15.873
No, he was wrapped at 4:15 PM.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.876
Which means when he
drove back on the lot
at 10:00 PM,

21:18.878 --> 21:20.778
it wasn't to work.

21:20.780 --> 21:21.345
No.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.681
You saw someone
with him, didn't you?

21:23.683 --> 21:25.516
Right? You did, Bert.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.884
So when Novo drove back
on the lot,

21:26.886 --> 21:28.552
you probably didn't
look too closely,

21:28.554 --> 21:31.856
didn't get a great look at
the girl, the girls, maybe?

21:31.858 --> 21:32.423
There were no girls.

21:32.425 --> 21:36.360
No offense, Bert,
but someone killed Novo,
and I doubt it was you.

21:36.362 --> 21:38.129
Unless this is a confession.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.263
Listen to me.

21:39.265 --> 21:42.333
There were no... Girls.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.639
Uh-huh.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.980
You have to promise me
you won't say anything
in the press.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.515
It'll ruin his memory.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.916
I'll do what I can.

21:58.918 --> 22:02.153
You have to understand
that I really loved him.

22:02.155 --> 22:07.158
Okay. But you weren't really
his fiancee, were you?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.627
He was my best friend.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.998
And the studio paid me
to be his girl.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.501
I warned him it was dangerous.

22:18.338 --> 22:22.340
He would pick up these men,
and he would bring them here,

22:22.342 --> 22:24.975
you know,
to impress them, and...

22:24.977 --> 22:25.409
And for privacy.

22:25.411 --> 22:29.980
Open secret with the studio.
Everyone was paid
to be discreet.

22:30.316 --> 22:32.016
Including the men.

22:32.785 --> 22:35.086
Where would he find these men?

22:35.088 --> 22:36.754
You know?

22:37.657 --> 22:40.091
CUTLER: No, no, you tell them
come back here,

22:40.093 --> 22:43.861
give me a full report,
then we talk
about opening your case.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.730
Oh, no, thank you.

22:45.832 --> 22:49.033
Charmain, where the hell...
Get in...

22:49.035 --> 22:49.967
What do you want?

22:49.969 --> 22:52.737
-Uh...
-Walk with me, walk with me.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.338
I'm... I'm... I'm...

22:54.340 --> 22:55.473
-Running the world?
-Yeah.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.174
I see that.
It looks good on you.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.442
Stuff it, you Gabby Mick.

22:58.444 --> 22:59.977
Ouch. The sting of truth.

22:59.979 --> 23:03.414
-So listen...
-Where the hell is Charmain?

23:03.416 --> 23:03.981
What do you need?

23:03.983 --> 23:07.251
Listen, the gun we found
at your house last night,
it's unregistered.

23:07.253 --> 23:08.552
We couldn't lift
a full print, but...

23:08.554 --> 23:10.121
Look, don't worry
about it, all right?

23:10.123 --> 23:12.423
The way things are now,
all this free love and drugs,

23:12.425 --> 23:16.460
there's a whole generation
of degenerates
spreading like crabs.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.262
It's a miracle anyone
gets through the day

23:18.264 --> 23:20.364
without some hopped-up freak
trying to mug 'em.

23:20.366 --> 23:23.501
It's just dumb luck that
that little nut got the drop
on me.

23:23.503 --> 23:26.337
Look, next time
I'll be wearing my piece
and my second.

23:26.339 --> 23:29.206
One to the head,
two to the balls.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.574
Peace and love, brother.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.343
Well, I thought
you were lost at sea.

23:32.345 --> 23:35.246
Booking had them.
And call for you on line two.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.080
Oh, big rush there, huh?

23:36.082 --> 23:39.750
Uncle Sammy Hodiak's
got you doing a lot of
extra credit work, huh?

23:39.752 --> 23:44.555
Well, the good news is
Sammy's a big boy, and he can
do his own investigating.

23:44.557 --> 23:49.326
You can tell him I said so
when you explain to him
that I want him on his beat

23:49.328 --> 23:52.096
and you in your corner,
where I put you.

23:52.098 --> 23:52.663
What's the matter?

23:52.665 --> 23:56.867
They don't teach you at work
there's a boss
and that's who you listen to?

23:56.869 --> 23:58.169
Go.

24:01.941 --> 24:05.543
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

24:20.159 --> 24:22.092
Whiskey, please.

24:23.262 --> 24:24.495
You got it.

24:24.497 --> 24:25.796
Thanks.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.865
Slow day today, huh?

24:27.867 --> 24:29.366
Average.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.536
So a friend of mine
was telling me...

24:32.538 --> 24:34.171
Yeah, the answer's no.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.739
-Excuse me?
-Whatever it is you want.

24:35.741 --> 24:39.310
Whatever you're
looking for... No.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.815
Ha. You don't remember me.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.518
It's gotta be 15 years now.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.721
New year's eve.
You sat at the bar.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.424
Laughing, flirting. Bait.

24:53.426 --> 24:54.358
Wait a second.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.594
You even bought me a beer.

24:56.696 --> 24:57.561
That was a long time ago.

24:57.563 --> 25:02.066
And midnight... Everyone
wants to kiss on new year's.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.068
So we do...

25:04.370 --> 25:08.806
And you and all your buddies
arrest every last one of us.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.243
All right,
I don't make the laws,

25:12.245 --> 25:13.577
but I do have to enforce them.

25:13.579 --> 25:15.379
-And there's
an investigation...
-I don't care

25:15.381 --> 25:17.848
if you're investigating
world peace.

25:17.850 --> 25:18.749
I'm not helping you.

25:18.751 --> 25:23.921
And maybe if you were
as cute as you used to be,
but now...

25:24.690 --> 25:26.624
I'm not a granny chaser.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.664
-Oh, hi, Sam.
-Hi, Kristin.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.266
How are you?

25:35.935 --> 25:38.035
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

25:39.105 --> 25:40.404
Yeah.

25:45.478 --> 25:48.312
Heard Cutler
dropped the hammer.

25:48.614 --> 25:49.780
Yeah.

25:49.782 --> 25:52.016
Well, I wouldn't cut
that hair just yet.

25:52.018 --> 25:54.485
Maybe... Maybe a trim,
maybe shape it a little.

25:54.487 --> 25:56.287
Wanna tell me what
you're talking about?

25:56.289 --> 25:58.889
I got something for you.
Undercover.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.825
-No, I'm out of...
-No, no, I'll go above Cutler.

26:01.827 --> 26:04.128
Straight to the captain.
'Cause I need help.

26:04.130 --> 26:07.031
I'd do it myself,
but I'm burned, and...

26:07.934 --> 26:09.433
Apparently not

26:09.435 --> 26:12.836
handsome or some...
I'm a grandma of some kind.

26:12.838 --> 26:13.971
Okay, yeah.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.540
You don't want to know
anything about it?
Just, no details?

26:16.542 --> 26:18.742
Honestly, just keep me out of
parking tickets,
I'll go anywhere.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.979
Okay.
Well, you're gonna have to
put on something nicer, okay?

26:21.981 --> 26:24.048
And I need you to go
to a bar and look nice,

26:24.050 --> 26:27.518
grab a drink,
talk to some folks...

26:27.587 --> 26:32.523
As a chatty, no apologies,
flaming homosexual.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.992
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

26:37.296 --> 26:38.796
We good?

26:45.104 --> 26:46.904
You're serious?

26:49.775 --> 26:53.944
Thing is, Charlie,
what you're asking,
it ain't easy,

26:53.946 --> 26:55.879
and it sure ain't free.

26:58.217 --> 27:01.018
Katie, honeyplum,
what ya doing?

27:01.320 --> 27:02.953
Bettering my mind.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.023
Put that book down,
star child, and come here.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.092
Hang out with Roy.

27:08.361 --> 27:09.960
(LAUGHS)

27:09.962 --> 27:12.496
Charlie, you use the same
tricks every time.

27:12.498 --> 27:15.065
Who's a trick? Excuse me!

27:15.067 --> 27:18.202
Look, man, I know
I ask a lot sometimes...

27:18.204 --> 27:19.403
Guns don't grow on trees.

27:19.405 --> 27:23.474
Well, wherever they grow,
pluck me some.

27:24.610 --> 27:26.510
Don't you have some?

27:27.613 --> 27:30.180
Lost. Hunting.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.683
And I need one more than ever.

27:34.453 --> 27:35.953
(CHUCKLES)

27:37.056 --> 27:39.990
Look, maybe I can
get you a few.

27:39.992 --> 27:40.290
My man.

27:40.292 --> 27:44.261
But it's gonna take time,
and it's gonna cost you.

27:44.263 --> 27:47.097
-Take Katie.
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.400
Yeah, I'm gonna need cash.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.718
So how come
you look so handsome?

28:07.887 --> 28:12.122
And how come you look
so uncomfortable about it?

28:12.958 --> 28:15.225
I gotta go be a swish.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.395
(LAUGHING)

28:19.765 --> 28:23.100
I'm trying to dig you as a...

28:23.636 --> 28:25.636
Little sweet-cheeked...

28:25.638 --> 28:27.571
-No, don't. Stop.
-Hey...

28:27.573 --> 28:29.239
Hey, hey, hey, hey, okay?

28:29.241 --> 28:33.010
You don't have to prove
anything to me, baby.

28:33.412 --> 28:36.013
Now where exactly
are you gonna be?

28:36.015 --> 28:41.085
At some club or bar that
they all hang out together.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.587
Uh, so you have to touch...

28:43.589 --> 28:45.923
No! No, no.
I just gotta go
interrogate them

28:45.925 --> 28:47.958
so they don't get
they're being interrogated.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.561
-Oh! Okay.
-Yeah, that's...

28:50.763 --> 28:52.596
That's all.

28:54.467 --> 28:56.233
Oh, poor baby.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.674
I may need another one
of those to keep in my pocket.

29:03.676 --> 29:05.709
Mmm-mmm. (CHUCKLES)

29:29.635 --> 29:32.870
You know,
you stick out like
a sore thumb.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.407
Don't get upset. It's fine.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.209
Chris.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.145
Um, Brian.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.180
First time here, right?

29:44.383 --> 29:47.050
Good for you. It's a big step.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.553
It's nice. Right?

29:49.555 --> 29:53.290
Being somewhere where
you're like everybody else.

29:54.927 --> 29:57.060
Lee. This guy...

29:57.563 --> 29:59.062
Next one's on me.

29:59.064 --> 30:00.998
You got it, Chris.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.536
Thanks.

30:08.741 --> 30:11.141
Now they're doomed.
You can't win
with a defense...

30:11.143 --> 30:14.411
They got Jerry's kids
out there playing D.

30:14.413 --> 30:15.679
Oh, hello, handsome.

30:15.681 --> 30:17.714
So it was pretty quiet
at the shop.

30:17.716 --> 30:20.050
No one I talked to
knew anything about...

30:20.052 --> 30:22.186
How was that, talking?

30:22.188 --> 30:23.220
Just talking?

30:23.222 --> 30:25.155
What is this, some
junior high hazing thing?

30:25.157 --> 30:28.058
It wasn't,
but you're so jumpy,
it's getting kind of fun.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.727
-I might continue.
-What, are you serious?

30:30.729 --> 30:33.564
That... Men doing that with,
with men...

30:33.566 --> 30:35.499
What do you care what
they do with each other?

30:35.501 --> 30:36.800
Something wrong with...

30:36.802 --> 30:37.501
-Lou!
-Sam!

30:37.503 --> 30:39.503
-Good to have you back.
-Good to see you.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.071
Shafe, my office.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.307
(WHISPERS) You're in trouble.

30:49.915 --> 30:51.381
(CHUCKLING)

30:51.784 --> 30:57.354
Uh, I've been informed
that you've been
pulled off undercover.

30:57.556 --> 31:01.191
Yeah, I'm supposed to.
I mean, I am off.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.726
I was just doing
something for Hodiak.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.495
Ah, ah, ah. New rule.
Use less words.

31:05.497 --> 31:07.664
Turns out life is short.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.566
I'll go change.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.201
Don't.

31:12.738 --> 31:13.904
Look...

31:13.906 --> 31:17.875
Yes, your investigation's
been taking too long.

31:17.877 --> 31:23.146
But I don't give a rip
what Cutler,
or any other narcotics dick

31:23.148 --> 31:25.649
in this entire
department thinks.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.752
I happen to feel
it's worth the investment.

31:28.754 --> 31:31.288
-Thank you, sir.
-Don't thank me.

31:31.290 --> 31:31.722
Get results.

31:31.724 --> 31:36.760
Or even I won't be able to
keep you out of
a meter maid skirt.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.029
Thank you.

31:40.799 --> 31:42.699
Okay, uh...

31:42.701 --> 31:44.701
Closed, closed.

31:44.703 --> 31:48.272
Soup you should eat
with your medication.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.474
And don't forget these.

31:54.113 --> 31:54.945
Well, thank you, Friday.

31:54.947 --> 31:57.147
I took minutes
at the last staff meeting.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.749
Do you want to
see them now or...

31:58.751 --> 32:00.217
-Charmain?
-Yes?

32:00.219 --> 32:03.020
Minutes and meds
and why are...

32:03.022 --> 32:03.854
You almost died.

32:03.856 --> 32:09.893
And I've seen that before.
I've seen it make people
different or better.

32:10.029 --> 32:11.895
Maybe now you feel different.

32:12.331 --> 32:15.632
A little more open to things
that can benefit you,

32:15.634 --> 32:21.505
and I hope that
you're more disposed
to seeing me for what I am.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.543
(LAUGHING)

32:26.545 --> 32:28.145
You want a rabbi.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.280
(LAUGHING)

32:32.151 --> 32:33.684
That is so cute.

32:35.054 --> 32:38.255
Would you please go get me
a cup of coffee?

32:41.060 --> 32:42.693
Okay.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.063
Charmain.

32:46.465 --> 32:49.166
Bring back the minutes
from those meetings

32:49.168 --> 32:51.668
and we'll go
through them together.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.908
Ah, thanks for
holding down the fort.

32:57.910 --> 33:00.110
Call for you about the
Raymond Novo murder.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.678
It's the commissioner.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.047
He sounds, um...

33:04.049 --> 33:06.016
You better take it.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.220
Yeah, they broke into my car
while I was here.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.656
My mom's jewelry box
was in the trunk.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.892
That's what kills me.
I can't go to the cops.

33:15.894 --> 33:18.395
I can't tell them I was here.

33:18.664 --> 33:19.763
I can keep a lookout,

33:19.765 --> 33:22.866
let you know if somebody
is suddenly in jewelry sales.

33:22.868 --> 33:25.502
Yeah, that...
That'd be great.
Thank you.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.171
Sore thumb.
You're back.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.840
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

33:29.842 --> 33:33.777
I, uh, I was just telling
Lee here that, uh,

33:33.779 --> 33:35.645
I had an incident
the other night...

33:35.647 --> 33:40.050
Well, before you get
too deep into the tale,
can I be frank?

33:40.686 --> 33:41.284
Sure.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.553
Here you are again,
trying to look relaxed,

33:43.555 --> 33:47.557
and you still look as guilty
as a hooker in church.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.293
I'm trying.

33:50.295 --> 33:51.561
I'm trying, I just...

33:51.563 --> 33:53.697
Don't worry about it.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.499
It's fine.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.402
I'm just being sympathetic.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.271
Okay. Message received.

34:01.273 --> 34:04.474
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, it's okay.

34:04.476 --> 34:05.842
Listen, kid,
you may be going through

34:05.844 --> 34:08.645
the epic cinemascope
trial of your life right now,

34:08.647 --> 34:09.379
trying to be you,

34:09.381 --> 34:13.083
but don't forget
the rest of us
aren't just extras.

34:13.952 --> 34:15.685
I'm really sorry.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.527
Hey, Lee, the usual.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.529
(PHONE RINGS)

34:25.531 --> 34:27.164
Hi.

34:27.332 --> 34:28.899
Hi.

34:30.502 --> 34:33.036
Hey, can I ask you a question?

34:34.306 --> 34:36.173
I'm new here
to the neighborhood, and...

34:36.175 --> 34:39.409
It's Brian, right?
Phone for you.

34:48.287 --> 34:49.886
Yeah. This is Brian.

34:49.888 --> 34:53.690
Pack it in, sparkle pants.
You're off the Novo case.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.158
Give me a second.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.359
I'm getting somewhere here.

34:56.361 --> 34:59.129
<i> -There is no there there.</i>
-English.

34:59.131 --> 35:03.033
You're off the Novo case
because there is no Novo case.

35:03.035 --> 35:03.733
So they got the guy?

35:03.735 --> 35:08.004
<i> There is no guy, and there</i>
<i> never will be a guy.</i>

35:08.006 --> 35:09.372
It's almost finished.

35:09.374 --> 35:12.275
The movie that Novo was doing
with his fiancee?

35:12.277 --> 35:14.878
Eight million dollars worth
of two-fisted western

35:14.880 --> 35:16.680
coming to a theater
near you at Easter.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.081
<i> So the studio</i>
<i> called the mayor,</i>

35:18.083 --> 35:19.616
<i> the mayor called</i>
<i> the commissioner,</i>

35:19.618 --> 35:20.650
<i> the commissioner</i>
<i> called our boss</i>

35:20.652 --> 35:23.553
and told him what we all
should have known
from the jump.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.922
When a studio's
got $8 million invested,

35:25.924 --> 35:29.960
stars can be dead,
but they can't be dead homos.

35:31.396 --> 35:33.697
So that's it. I'm just done?

35:33.966 --> 35:36.600
Tip your barman
on the way out.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.517
(SIGHS)

35:53.719 --> 35:54.384
Sorry, I just...

35:54.386 --> 35:56.253
-That's okay.
-Just give me a few minutes,

35:56.255 --> 35:57.254
-and I'll...
-Baby, baby...

35:57.256 --> 35:59.156
-...try it again.
-That's okay.

35:59.158 --> 35:59.789
No, it's not all right.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.959
-Just let me do it again.
-Eddie. Eddie.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.528
Can I tell you something
without you getting mad?

36:04.530 --> 36:08.198
You're not the first guy
that I've been with
that this has happened to.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.100
We're not
in high school anymore.

36:10.102 --> 36:12.135
I wish to hell I was.

36:12.337 --> 36:15.505
Come on. Let's give it a rest.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.397
Hey, Paul Lynde.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.165
Thanks for your help.

36:43.936 --> 36:44.367
What help?

36:44.369 --> 36:48.705
You had to know when I
walked in that bar
I was gonna get shut down.

36:48.707 --> 36:52.909
Well, I thought we might be
faster than
the Hollywood machine.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.711
Long shot.

36:55.647 --> 36:59.516
You're somewhat exercised
for a guy who thought
he'd catch a limp wrist

36:59.518 --> 37:00.217
just by drinking their beer.

37:00.219 --> 37:04.387
I like catching killers.
Don't need to think too much
on the details.

37:04.389 --> 37:04.955
Mighty big of you.

37:04.957 --> 37:08.625
Why the hell
are you so up with people
on a bunch of homos anyway?

37:08.627 --> 37:09.993
No, really, I... I get it.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.494
Some otherwise
nice-seeming guys,

37:11.496 --> 37:13.563
sad to see them
wreck their lives like that,

37:13.565 --> 37:16.266
but it's still deviant, huh?

37:16.268 --> 37:17.968
Still...

37:18.737 --> 37:19.803
Wrong.

37:19.805 --> 37:24.708
Well, I thought you were
of the "free your mind,
roll your own" generation.

37:24.710 --> 37:25.408
Don't act dumb, all right?

37:25.410 --> 37:28.211
There is a line,
and they stick their necks
out crossing it.

37:28.213 --> 37:31.014
And they know it.
You know what it is?

37:31.016 --> 37:33.216
They're... They're addicted.

37:33.218 --> 37:34.884
Yeah, like all
the junkies I see.

37:34.886 --> 37:38.922
And they know something
can go wrong,
and they do it anyway.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.391
They're just sick.

37:41.927 --> 37:42.859
It's sad.

37:42.861 --> 37:46.663
And for what, huh?
How the hell is it worth
the risk to do that?

37:46.665 --> 37:49.933
You know what I realized
trying to understand people?

37:49.935 --> 37:52.736
-What?
-Don't try to understand 'em.

37:53.639 --> 37:56.773
I know what I'd kill for
and what I'd die for.

37:56.775 --> 37:57.407
You served. You do, too.

37:57.409 --> 38:00.744
And every day on this job,
we get to see what other
people would kill and die for

38:00.746 --> 38:03.246
and I used to think
it was different,
but it's not.

38:03.248 --> 38:07.050
It's the same. Love, hate.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.252
With a side of stupid.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.657
You seem...

38:14.326 --> 38:15.692
Old?

38:17.763 --> 38:19.396
You okay?

38:20.399 --> 38:21.831
Well...

38:22.034 --> 38:25.001
(SIGHS)
Go home and kiss your wife.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.907
You can count on that.

38:58.270 --> 39:01.338
(INAUDIBLE)

39:18.657 --> 39:21.624
Hiya, Ed.
Thought you punched out.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.593
Yeah, I did.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.765
Hey, uh, you got the time?

39:28.767 --> 39:30.433
Yeah, sure.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.797
SADIE: Charlie? We're back.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.108
Mother Mary.

40:13.345 --> 40:15.945
Look at that blessing.

40:17.416 --> 40:19.682
You see it in her eyes.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.319
The wounded little bird.

40:23.989 --> 40:25.722
Mother...

40:26.391 --> 40:27.824
Lover...

40:27.926 --> 40:29.659
(WHISPERS)
Goddess.

40:29.661 --> 40:32.162
Let me back into your heart.

40:32.998 --> 40:36.633
-Charlie, I...
-I know, I know, I...

40:36.635 --> 40:39.335
-I hurt you.
-You didn't hurt me, Charlie.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.838
You... Hurt me.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.406
I saw stars.

40:43.408 --> 40:46.509
I couldn't chew for a week.

40:46.511 --> 40:49.145
I won't apologize for passion.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.347
I love you.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.651
I love you so much.

40:55.487 --> 40:56.886
Mary...

40:57.189 --> 41:00.690
Mary, you are the light,

41:00.826 --> 41:04.060
and I am
the lighthouse keeper.

41:04.362 --> 41:07.030
-(BEADS CLATTERING)
-KATIE: Mary?

41:08.366 --> 41:11.100
Oh, my God!

41:17.142 --> 41:18.942
Is it yours?

41:19.277 --> 41:21.010
I don't know.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.447
Is it mine, cherry pie?

41:34.926 --> 41:36.526
It's ours.

41:37.696 --> 41:39.095
Yes.

41:41.466 --> 41:43.833
And we'll raise it together.

41:43.902 --> 41:46.402
We are a revolution.

41:47.305 --> 41:49.372
And one day,

41:49.641 --> 41:52.242
the world will know our name.

41:52.978 --> 41:54.511
KATIE: Yes.
