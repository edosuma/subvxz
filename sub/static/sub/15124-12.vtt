WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:04.672
So let's take a look at what's
going on around the country.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.307
You know what?

00:06.340 --> 00:09.210
Just bear with me while I
take off these annoying pants.

00:09.243 --> 00:12.180
Looks like Scotch Wilkinson
had a liquid lunch again.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.114
(chuckling)

00:13.147 --> 00:15.516
Another hurricane is headed
for the tropics.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.152
Maybe they'll name this one
after my ex-wife.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.521
Call it Hurricane Bi...
(steady beep tone)

00:20.554 --> 00:22.356
ANNOUNCER:
If you're gonna spend

00:22.390 --> 00:24.158
two months' salary on a ring,

00:24.192 --> 00:26.394
you want to blow
your girl's mind.

00:26.427 --> 00:29.363
(sighs)
You know what really
makes my head explode?

00:29.397 --> 00:31.599
The way society
has conditioned women to base

00:31.632 --> 00:34.335
their self-worth on their
engagement ring. I mean,

00:34.368 --> 00:36.704
I'm a free-thinking woman.
I'm not one of Pavlov's dogs.

00:36.737 --> 00:37.305
(timer dings)

00:37.338 --> 00:39.073
Ooh, cookies are ready.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.841
(chuckles)

00:40.874 --> 00:42.376
You're not buying
any of that

00:42.410 --> 00:44.445
"I don't want a ring"
stuff, are you?

00:44.478 --> 00:47.248
No, I think that's really
how she feels.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.383
I know I haven't given you
a lot of fatherly advice,

00:49.417 --> 00:51.219
but I can't let you
make this mistake.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.087
You got to buy Sabrina
an engagement ring.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.123
Whoa, but they are so expensive.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.724
You have to do
whatever it takes.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.293
I busted my butt doing extra
work for your mother's ring.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.728
What kind of work?

01:00.761 --> 01:01.729
Extra work.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.397
T.J. Hooker was
filming in town.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.266
They paid me 50 bucks
a day to lay in a creek

01:05.299 --> 01:06.800
full of small but
very angry turtles.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.102
It was awful.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.237
Two things I learned:

01:09.270 --> 01:11.139
Captain Kirk cannot
remember his lines

01:11.172 --> 01:12.373
and he is not a hugger.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.707
But it doesn't matter.

01:13.741 --> 01:14.375
It was worth it.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.110
Your mother loves that ring.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.245
Maybe you're right.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.313
MAW MAW:
Of course he's right.

01:19.347 --> 01:21.749
A nice diamond ring gives you
something pretty to focus on

01:21.782 --> 01:25.186
when your fat, sweaty husband's
wheezing on top of you

01:25.219 --> 01:27.221
like a dying walrus.

01:27.255 --> 01:30.624
Whoo!

01:30.658 --> 01:31.625
* Here we go

01:31.659 --> 01:34.828
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:36.697 --> 01:37.765
(chuckling)

01:37.798 --> 01:39.600
That never gets old.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.503
(snorts)
I was telling Jimmy
how hard I worked for your...

01:42.536 --> 01:44.438
Hey, where's
your engagement ring?

01:44.472 --> 01:46.440
Oh, I always take it off
when I wash the dishes.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.575
It's probably by the sink.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.143
You're gonna go get it, right?

01:49.177 --> 01:50.278
I'll grab it in the morning.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.146
I never wear it at night.
But it'd be

01:52.180 --> 01:53.181
safer in your jewelry box.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.782
I'll go get it.
No, I'll get it.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.817
I...

02:02.656 --> 02:04.625
(sneezes)

02:08.862 --> 02:10.864
(coughs)

02:21.375 --> 02:23.177
It's not there.
But I just remembered

02:23.211 --> 02:25.546
that we're about to clean
a really nasty house last week,

02:25.579 --> 02:27.215
so I left it in Rosa's car.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.882
Big Judy.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.318
I need my ring back.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.952
Burt saw I wasn't wearing it.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.721
Oh, you poor baby.

02:33.754 --> 02:37.258
I've pawned this thing, like,
50 times and he's never noticed.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.293
Stupid Jimmy and his engagement.

02:39.327 --> 02:43.231
So, do you think I could
possibly, just this once,

02:43.264 --> 02:44.865
get the ring from you today

02:44.898 --> 02:47.635
and then I'll pay you on Friday
when I get my check?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.470
I can do a lot of things.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.340
I can carry a refrigerator
on my back.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.343
I can recite pi
up to 20 digits.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.845
And I'm a hell
of a ventriloquist.

02:57.878 --> 03:01.382
But I can't give you
your ring back early.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.651
Oh, come on.
You know I'm good for it.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.685
Sorry.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.755
I'm a businesswoman,
Virginia.

03:09.323 --> 03:12.793
When you bring me my money,
I'll give you your ring.

03:15.563 --> 03:19.600
The fertility clinic is paying
50 bucks for every donation.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.603
Nothing says romance
like buying your fiancÃ©e a ring

03:22.636 --> 03:25.939
with money you earned by
knocking up dozens of lesbians.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.742
Did you find the ring?

03:28.776 --> 03:29.943
I did one better.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.245
I found

03:31.279 --> 03:32.546
your favorite...

03:32.580 --> 03:34.915
double-battered onion rings!

03:34.948 --> 03:36.016
Oh, my God.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.285
You lost your engagement ring.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.320
Calm down.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.421
Look, I take it off

03:40.454 --> 03:42.022
all the time. It'll turn up.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.391
I guarantee you

03:43.424 --> 03:45.526
I will find that ring by Friday.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.894
I can't just sit
around here and wait.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.796
I went through a lot
to get you that ring.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.899
I got hepatitis C from one
of those T.J. Hooker turtles.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.435
We need to start
retracing your steps.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.969
You've been on this couch,
right?

03:56.003 --> 03:56.970
I found it.

03:57.004 --> 03:57.938
The ring?

03:57.971 --> 03:58.939
No. A position I'm

03:58.972 --> 04:00.374
qualified for: Psychological

04:00.408 --> 04:01.809
and Medical Research Guinea Pig.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.744
Look at this cute cartoon
of a patient on a gurney

04:03.777 --> 04:06.280
with dollar signs for eyes.
That could be me!

04:06.314 --> 04:08.416
Okay, Mr. Chance.

04:08.449 --> 04:11.352
And which of
these flowers

04:11.385 --> 04:13.354
do you find prettier?

04:14.488 --> 04:15.589
That one?

04:18.492 --> 04:20.294
(zapping)
(shouting)

04:20.328 --> 04:21.962
Okay. I think we're

04:21.995 --> 04:23.297
all about done here.

04:23.331 --> 04:26.334
I'll be right back
with your check.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.968
(sighs)

04:28.001 --> 04:29.503
MAN:
Okay,

04:29.537 --> 04:32.005
let's get started here.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.841
Why are you naked?

04:33.874 --> 04:36.844
Because you told me
to get naked.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.446
No, I didn't.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.613
Yes, you did.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.449
And then you shocked me.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.716
A lot.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.985
(both sigh)

04:47.120 --> 04:48.989
Hubert, stop stealing my white
coats and scaring people.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.658
I'm sorry.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.660
This is my brother. He's
supposed to be staying in my car

04:52.693 --> 04:53.861
while I work.
I'm not

04:53.894 --> 04:55.463
supposed to be staying
in your car.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.365
You're supposed
to be staying in my car.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.799
I'm the doctor.

04:58.832 --> 05:02.370
BOTH:
Jimmy, which one of us
is the real doctor?

05:03.371 --> 05:05.005
I don't know.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.641
(zapping)
(grunting)

05:09.543 --> 05:12.646
Hmm. Interesting.
Hmm. Interesting.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.520
(sighs)
Come on, Burt.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.789
You can't tear apart
the whole house.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.391
I need to take a shower.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.492
The ring could be
in here, Virginia.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.493
Just let me look.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.994
Babe, we need our bathroom back.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.729
My 86-year-old grandmother's
outside peeing

05:28.762 --> 05:30.531
in the neighbors' bushes.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.500
One thing has nothing to do
with the other, Virginia,

05:32.533 --> 05:33.501
and you know it.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.968
(sighs)
This is insane.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.371
We can't tear apart
the whole house.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.740
When the Bronsteins bring over
their tomatoes this year,

05:39.773 --> 05:42.510
they go straight
in the garbage.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.678
Burt, please don't drive
yourself crazy over this.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.548
I promise you
the ring will turn up.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.620
I'll take this one.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.060
You got to be
kidding me.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.395
800 bucks?

06:01.429 --> 06:02.563
I mean, that's too much.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.597
Can't you cut me a deal?

06:03.631 --> 06:06.033
Nope. That's one
of my top earners.

06:06.066 --> 06:10.103
I've bought and sold that from
the same person over 20 times.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.506
Who'd be stupid enough to keep
buying the same ring?

06:12.540 --> 06:13.707
I can't tell you that.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.409
When I became
a member of

06:15.443 --> 06:17.545
the Pawnshop Owners Association,

06:17.578 --> 06:19.713
I took an oath
of confidentiality.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.515
I could lose my license.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.851
All I can say is

06:23.884 --> 06:26.520
you couldn't get me to tell you

06:26.554 --> 06:30.157
if you dragged me from here
to Virginia.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.160
Not a chance.

06:34.562 --> 06:35.896
You hear what I'm saying to you?

06:35.929 --> 06:37.498
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can't help me.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.132
You don't have to be
a jerk about it.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.602
(door opens)

06:46.474 --> 06:47.975
Hey. Is your
mom home?

06:48.008 --> 06:50.210
I'm dying to know
if she found her ring.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.445
I haven't seen her.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.613
Well, I guess I'll work out.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.449
Get rid of some
of this nervous energy.

06:55.483 --> 06:56.784
What's going on there?
Oh, I didn't

06:56.817 --> 06:58.619
make enough money
from the shock tests

06:58.652 --> 07:00.588
to pay for the ring, so I got
to do some more experiments.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.823
It's actually
really important work,

07:02.856 --> 07:03.791
and I'm gonna be able
to help people.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.092
I'm getting paid to test

07:05.125 --> 07:06.894
this new anti-seizure
mouth spray.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.829
But you don't get seizures.
Well,

07:08.862 --> 07:10.631
apparently seizures are
a side effect for these pills

07:10.664 --> 07:11.765
that I'm also being paid
to take.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.534
You really took my advice
and went for it.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.802
I'm proud of you.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.107
(clattering)
Look at you.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.943
Doing whatever it takes!

07:24.545 --> 07:26.914
(phone ringing)

07:26.947 --> 07:28.482
Hello?

07:28.516 --> 07:30.183
BIG JUDY:
You better collect some cash

07:30.217 --> 07:31.752
and get your butt down here.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.822
Somebody is interested
in buying your ring.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.925
Who?
Now, you know
I can't tell you that.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.594
You may think I'm a son...

07:40.628 --> 07:41.795
of a bitch,

07:41.829 --> 07:44.097
but there's no way you can

07:44.131 --> 07:47.535
jimmy the information
out of me.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.503
You see where I'm going
with this?

07:49.537 --> 07:50.804
Of course. I'm not dumb.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.205
You're not gonna help me.

07:52.239 --> 07:55.976
(sighs)

07:56.009 --> 07:57.678
VIRGINIA:
I couldn't risk someone else
buying that ring.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.813
I had to do whatever it took
to get it back.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.715
That meant getting
in and out of the house

08:01.749 --> 08:03.283
without anyone noticing.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.252
*

08:33.280 --> 08:35.248
(sighs)

08:37.585 --> 08:39.587
Works fast.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.254
Tastes minty.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.757
Come on, those candlesticks
got to be enough.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.993
Not quite.
(sighs)

08:46.026 --> 08:49.697
That is a rare director's cut
edition of Cujo

08:49.730 --> 08:51.031
on VHS.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.733
It's only 20 minutes long.
I guess he didn't

08:52.766 --> 08:54.101
think much of the dog's
performance.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.870
Someone definitely is gonna
want to buy 20 minutes of Cujo.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.138
What else you got?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.175
That thing work?

09:02.209 --> 09:03.176
It gets hot.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.045
Hot is good.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.315
You got a deal.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.590
Burt, what happened?

09:16.624 --> 09:18.058
We got robbed, Virginia.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.761
Somebody came into this house.

09:20.794 --> 09:21.895
Took several
odds and ends.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.664
Bastards even got
some knickknacks.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.032
Like what?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.900
So far we know
they got our toaster,

09:26.934 --> 09:29.036
our copy of Cujo,
and Maw Maw's candlesticks.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.804
VIRGINIA:
How could you even notice

09:30.838 --> 09:32.906
that stuff was gone?
How could I not?

09:32.940 --> 09:34.942
They're all part
of my workout routine.

09:34.975 --> 09:38.045
BURT:
I like to start my workout
with some air-drumming.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.947
And then when I'm loose,

09:39.980 --> 09:42.816
I usually up the weight
with Maw Maw's candlesticks.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.786
But today the candlesticks
were gone.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.788
So I decided to skip
my drumming

09:47.821 --> 09:50.090
and go straight
to my bicep curls.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.292
Normally, I use the toaster
as a flex mirror

09:52.325 --> 09:56.930
when I do my soup
and sauce curls.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.633
But today I couldn't find
the toaster anywhere.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.168
And I couldn't use
the bathroom mirror

10:01.201 --> 10:02.936
because I didn't think
of that until just now.

10:02.970 --> 10:07.307
So I decided to move straight
to my TV squats.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.343
I keep track of my reps by
reading off the names of tapes.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.344
Children of the Corn.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.281
Halloween.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.784
I arrange them by the ferocity
of serial killer.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.018
Friday the 13th.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.653
And today, when I got

10:19.687 --> 10:21.354
to Cujo and it wasn't there,

10:21.388 --> 10:23.657
I realized the candlesticks
and the toaster

10:23.691 --> 10:24.725
weren't just missing...

10:24.758 --> 10:25.859
We got robbed!

10:25.893 --> 10:27.094
We got robbed!

10:27.127 --> 10:28.428
I heard you the first time.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.831
Oh! There you are!
(laughs)

10:30.864 --> 10:31.865
Hello, Ross.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.667
Hello, sweet Virginia.

10:33.701 --> 10:34.835
Is this really necessary?

10:34.868 --> 10:37.671
That stuff was only
worth $78.25.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.306
Um... or so.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.876
Now, normally we don't dust
for prints on stolen VHS tapes,

10:42.910 --> 10:44.845
but since it's you, I did.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.180
Plus, I dusted the whole house
because it needed it.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.717
I'm the kind of guy who's not
afraid to do household chores.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.819
The little guy's been awesome.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.320
I never saw
Kindergarten Cop,

10:53.353 --> 10:55.455
but I assume this
is what he was like.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.456
Oh, I'm just getting warmed up.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.826
Once the judge gets out
of his Zumba class,

10:58.859 --> 11:00.160
I'm gonna get him
to sign some warrants

11:00.193 --> 11:02.329
so that we can search
local pawnshops.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.998
I'm gonna go see if there's
anything else missing.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.868
I counted 17 pairs
of underwear in your drawer.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.469
If it should be more,
let me know.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.138
(barking)

11:11.171 --> 11:12.840
Big Judy, I need
all my stuff back.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.241
Here. Take the ring.

11:14.274 --> 11:19.012
Girl, you lose this ring
more than Bilbo Baggins.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.248
Oh...

11:21.281 --> 11:23.083
Maw Maw must have
put them in there.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.886
She's always doing
something crazy.

11:25.919 --> 11:26.920
I agree.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.722
That old lady's a nut.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.390
Every time I go
in the bathroom,

11:30.423 --> 11:31.992
I catch her above the sink

11:32.025 --> 11:33.894
trying to copy
everything I do.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.763
Case...

11:35.796 --> 11:37.164
closed.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.331
Unless you guys
want to look around,

11:38.365 --> 11:39.900
make sure nothing else
is missing.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.334
Virginia's engagement ring
is missing.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.270
ROSS:
Missing?
Or deliberately hidden

11:43.303 --> 11:45.739
because there's a little
trouble in paradise?

11:45.773 --> 11:47.875
There's no trouble, Ross.
It's just missing.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.176
But we don't know that.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.210
I mean, originally you said

11:50.243 --> 11:51.879
you left it by the kitchen sink.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.013
Maybe you did,

11:53.046 --> 11:55.783
and somebody came in here
and took it!

11:55.816 --> 11:57.250
I'm gonna go hit
the local pawnshops.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.320
My phone has an app that lets me
know where they all are.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.391
That's a picture of you
in your underpants

12:04.424 --> 12:05.759
on a fur rug.
What?

12:05.793 --> 12:07.795
Oh... (laughs)

12:07.828 --> 12:08.962
That's peculiar.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.497
How'd that get there?

12:40.027 --> 12:41.461
What the hell?
(gasps)

12:41.494 --> 12:43.030
What the hell?

12:44.464 --> 12:45.966
What are you doing?

12:45.999 --> 12:47.167
Were you stealing
that painting?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.169
I am not stealing it.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.171
I am borrowing it to pawn

12:51.204 --> 12:53.140
so I can get my
engagement ring back.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.975
I already took
all the good stuff

12:55.008 --> 12:56.109
out of my house
and it backfired.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.978
What are you doing?

12:58.011 --> 12:59.279
If you must know,

12:59.312 --> 13:01.849
my family has a little bit
of a body hair issue.

13:01.882 --> 13:02.950
And believe me,
this is nothing.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.317
I got an aunt
that looks like Borat.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.954
You get weirder
and weirder every week.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.822
Does Jimmy know about this?

13:08.856 --> 13:09.957
No, of course not.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.458
Good, so here's the deal:

13:11.491 --> 13:13.460
you let me pawn this stuff
and Jimmy never finds out

13:13.493 --> 13:15.829
that he's marrying
into the Sasquatch family.

13:15.863 --> 13:16.830
Fine.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.867
Clay Aiken!

13:19.900 --> 13:21.969
Hey, Sabrina.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.837
You bring some
hair to sell?

13:23.871 --> 13:26.539
Uh... not-not today.

13:26.573 --> 13:27.975
Don't need it.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.210
This has to be worth enough
to get my ring back

13:30.243 --> 13:32.880
because these are
real fake breasts.
Mm-hmm.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.147
I'll give you $200 for these.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.349
Yes!
But it doesn't matter

13:36.383 --> 13:38.986
'cause somebody done came
and bought your ring.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.054
What? No!
That can't be true.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.389
(gasps softly)

13:42.422 --> 13:44.157
It's the exact
cut and clarity

13:44.191 --> 13:47.094
of the kidney stone
I passed in 2008.

13:50.063 --> 13:54.601
Someday, some lucky girl is
gonna get my wiener diamond.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.512
How are you gonna
give it to her?

14:05.545 --> 14:08.015
Well, I was thinking about
getting down on one knee

14:08.048 --> 14:11.018
and then slowly
opening the box.

14:11.051 --> 14:14.054
Dude, that is the missionary
position of proposals.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.923
You gotta do better
than that.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.057
You're right.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.226
I can't just hand it
to her. That's lame.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.394
Well, luckily for you,

14:21.428 --> 14:24.064
I've spent a lot of time
thinking of cool ways

14:24.097 --> 14:25.398
to propose to Sabrina.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.368
Three of them can be
done in this store.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.171
Do you know any members
of the band "The Knack"?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.040
And would Sabrina
be willing to

14:33.073 --> 14:35.909
change her name
to "Sharona"?
No.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.245
All right, two of them
can be done in this store.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.584
Okay.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.087
One more glass of wine

14:47.120 --> 14:49.089
and then I'll have
the courage to tell Burt

14:49.122 --> 14:50.290
I lost my engagement ring.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.559
First of all,
that's tequila.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.028
Here's an idea.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.229
You think Burt would
notice if we got

14:56.263 --> 14:58.298
a ring that kind of
looked like yours?

14:58.331 --> 14:59.699
Of course not,
he's a guy.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.568
They can identify our
nipples from 40 feet away

15:01.601 --> 15:02.569
through a wool sweater,

15:02.602 --> 15:05.105
but they have no idea
what our rings look like.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.639
So why not try this?

15:06.673 --> 15:08.075
Because I'll know.

15:08.108 --> 15:11.044
Oh, I love that ring.

15:11.078 --> 15:14.081
Burt worked so hard to get it.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.383
And it's always
been there for me,

15:16.416 --> 15:18.085
whether I needed to look at it

15:18.118 --> 15:21.421
to remind myself
how much he loved me...

15:21.454 --> 15:24.257
(voice breaking):
...or pawn it
to pay for groceries.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.259
Oh, I can't believe it's gone.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.428
Oh.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.998
I was sure it
was safe to pawn

15:31.031 --> 15:34.968
because it's so cheap
and dinged up, I...

15:35.002 --> 15:37.604
and I knew no one else
would ever want it.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.472
(sighs)

15:39.506 --> 15:41.274
That's sweet.

15:41.308 --> 15:44.511
I mean, it's not
just a ring; it...

15:44.544 --> 15:46.479
kind of represents
your marriage.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.149
Why? Because no one
would ever want it?

15:49.182 --> 15:50.617
No, no, just the opposite.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.986
All I want is
a marriage like yours.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.988
One of the reasons
I fell in love with Jimmy

15:55.022 --> 15:57.157
is the possibility
of getting that.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.458
That's why you fell
in love with him?

15:58.491 --> 16:00.260
Because Burt and I
have never been able

16:00.293 --> 16:02.129
to figure that one out.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.464
Hey! There you are.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.133
Uh, Sabrina,

16:06.166 --> 16:07.500
would you do me the honor

16:07.534 --> 16:09.602
of reaching your hand
into this barrel

16:09.636 --> 16:11.171
and grasping a pickle?

16:11.204 --> 16:12.439
No, old people are
always sticking

16:12.472 --> 16:13.773
their wrinkly hands
in there. It's gross.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.008
Listen.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.277
I was just
with your mother

16:17.310 --> 16:19.646
and I realized that
an engagement ring

16:19.679 --> 16:21.381
is more than just
metal and a stone.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.650
I know what I said before,

16:23.683 --> 16:26.186
but if you got me one,

16:26.219 --> 16:28.055
I wouldn't complain.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.156
Oh.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.757
(giggles softly)

16:37.064 --> 16:38.031
Hey!

16:38.065 --> 16:40.233
Ow!

16:40.267 --> 16:42.235
What the hell?

16:42.269 --> 16:44.337
Congratulations!

16:44.371 --> 16:46.406
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
need that ring back.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.643
Where's Sabrina?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.045
I can't give her
this ring, Frank.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.114
Why n... (snorts)

16:54.147 --> 16:55.215
Why not?

16:55.248 --> 16:56.649
Because when she
didn't want a ring,

16:56.683 --> 16:58.318
this dinky little thing
would have been fine.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.519
It's better than nothing.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.521
But now that she
actually wants a ring,

17:01.554 --> 17:03.390
I'm gonna have to do
better than this.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.227
Excuse me.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.530
Hey, Big Judy,

17:10.563 --> 17:12.532
I have to sell this ring back.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.234
(falsetto voice):
Busted, dirtbag!

17:14.267 --> 17:15.835
(normal voice):
I mean, "Busted, dirtbag!"

17:15.868 --> 17:19.206
You're under arrest for
trafficking in stolen property.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.407
What?

17:21.474 --> 17:25.245
Oh, no...
this is all my fault.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.446
That's what I was hoping.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.215
Don't worry; once you're
in jail with your son,

17:28.248 --> 17:30.083
I'll be here to
comfort Virginia.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.451
I didn't break any laws.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.786
I just told Jimmy to do
whatever it takes to get a ring.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.256
I bet Virginia really did
leave hers in the kitchen

17:36.289 --> 17:37.457
and Jimmy grabbed it.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.126
And then to cover his tracks,

17:39.159 --> 17:40.693
he lied about doing
medical testing.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.130
Oh, that boy may not be
good at a lot of things,

17:43.163 --> 17:44.231
but he sure can
fake a seizure.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.699
Maybe that'll help
him in prison.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.735
Bail is set for $500.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.404
That's a lot of lettuce.
Street talk for "cash."

17:51.438 --> 17:53.406
Where the hell am I gonna
get that kind of scratch?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.242
What's "scratch"?

17:55.275 --> 17:57.244
I need to pawn this.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.279
You white folks
and high cholesterol

17:59.312 --> 18:00.480
are gonna be the end of me.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.487
How many times do I have to tell
you I didn't steal the ring?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.622
I paid for it with my
medical research money.

18:09.656 --> 18:12.225
Well, hopefully they were
looking for a cure for lying!

18:12.259 --> 18:13.893
This is crazy!

18:13.926 --> 18:15.162
Burt...

18:15.195 --> 18:16.796
I have to tell you
something terrible.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.599
It's really, really bad.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.768
Virginia, hey.
I found your ring.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.304
How did you...?
Well, I was
at the new house

18:24.337 --> 18:25.272
and I just found it
underneath a chair.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.175
Oh, my God, that's so great!

18:28.208 --> 18:29.909
Oh, but I have to
go talk to Jimmy.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.579
Oh, what was the terrible news
you wanted to tell me?

18:32.612 --> 18:35.615
I... heard an awful tabloid
rumor about John Travolta,

18:35.648 --> 18:37.617
but it's probably better
if you don't hear it.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.752
Say no more.
La-la-la-la-la...

18:39.786 --> 18:41.321
(whispering):
How did you get this?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.290
Big Judy told me
somebody returned it.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.291
I've been taking
her ventriloquism class

18:44.324 --> 18:46.626
down at the
community center.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.196
(choking on water):
I'm getting pretty good at it.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.230
(chokes, coughs)

18:51.364 --> 18:53.333
(groans)
Dad, it's okay.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.634
No, it's not.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.836
I should have believed you when
you said you didn't steal it.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.605
I don't want to think about
what happened to you in prison.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.341
I was on a bench
at the police station.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.610
They gave me a sandwich.
Turkey.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.812
Don't try and spare
my feelings, Jimmy.

19:05.845 --> 19:06.846
I don't deserve it.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.649
Tomorrow, you and I
are gonna go down to that lab

19:09.682 --> 19:11.818
and do whatever tests
they have.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.686
I'll never be able to get you
your innocence back,

19:13.720 --> 19:16.356
but I can at least help you get
the money for another ring.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.362
You don't have
to do this, Dad.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.696
No, I want to.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.898
I'm not scared of a
little scientific testing.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.535
Think we'll actually feel

19:28.568 --> 19:31.371
our testicles recede
into our abdomens?

19:31.404 --> 19:32.205
Well, the pamphlet says

19:32.239 --> 19:34.341
it would feel like
two hot air balloons

19:34.374 --> 19:36.843
floating up into the sky.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.478
I think I'm gonna go
into the bathroom,

19:38.511 --> 19:40.347
say good-bye to them
one more time.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.514
You know, wish them
a safe trip

19:41.548 --> 19:43.350
in case I don't see
them for a while.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.552
Godspeed, Heckle
and Schmekel.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.923
Jimmy...

19:50.957 --> 19:53.560
I've been thinking.

19:55.395 --> 19:58.265
I want you to give
my ring to Sabrina.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.732
Well, you can't do that.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.368
It's your ring.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.536
So, now it'll be
a family ring.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.838
I want to pass it
down to you.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.808
And someday, you can
pass it on to Hope.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.446
That's more special
than any ring you can buy.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.382
And I happen to know

20:15.415 --> 20:18.751
that this is exactly the kind
of ring Sabrina wants.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.724
Thanks, Mom. That's sweet.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.660
Oh, I'm glad you caught me
before I took those pills.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.573
Hey, why are
you guys hugging?

20:46.513 --> 20:50.317
JIMMY:
Usually, when you get advice
from a lot of different people,

20:50.350 --> 20:52.452
they can't all be right.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.820
Oh...

20:53.853 --> 20:56.489
JIMMY:
But this time they were.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.658
Dad was right that Sabrina

20:58.691 --> 21:01.594
really wanted
an engagement ring.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.796
Frank was right that
how you present the ring

21:03.830 --> 21:05.998
is as important
as the ring itself.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.942
And Mom was right about
how much Sabrina would like

21:15.975 --> 21:17.644
getting her ring.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.815
And it turns out those guys
at the medical lab

21:22.849 --> 21:24.917
were right about
those side effects.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.953
How far up
do you think they went?

21:26.986 --> 21:31.090
Ah... Oh...

21:31.123 --> 21:32.392
Right about here.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.565
GIRL:
Testicles are funny.
