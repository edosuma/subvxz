01:55.659 --> 01:58.256
- Prudhomme.
- John, sorry to call you so early.

01:58.556 --> 01:59.955
- I was up.
- We got a problem.

02:06.446 --> 02:08.145
What time is it?

02:11.043 --> 02:12.840
It's early.

02:13.940 --> 02:15.837
OK. I'll make you some breakfast.

02:18.036 --> 02:20.730
I don't have time.
Go back to sleep.

02:33.422 --> 02:36.318
Yeah. The old man says,
"Son, I get a hard-on once a week...

02:36.518 --> 02:39.414
but I fart at least
ten times a day".

02:40.912 --> 02:43.410
- Good morning, John.
- Keep them away, Mac.

02:43.610 --> 02:43.875
OK. Stay back!

02:43.910 --> 02:45.908
- You've been inside?
- No, I just got here.

02:48.007 --> 02:50.502
Hey, how does a blonde turn
the lights on after sex?

02:51.201 --> 02:52.799
She opens the car door.

02:54.698 --> 02:57.695
- I don't know why I waste my good jokes on you.
- I don't know either.

03:01.191 --> 03:03.788
Prudhomme. What are
you doing here?

03:04.188 --> 03:07.084
- I got the call.
- Bullshit. We were at the scene first.

03:07.284 --> 03:09.781
- I got the call!
- What's the deal, man?

03:09.981 --> 03:11.779
You don't have enough cases
that you need more?

03:12.079 --> 03:14.178
- Where's the body?
- I asked you a question.

03:14.376 --> 03:16.374
Hey! He just doing what
they told him to do.

03:16.974 --> 03:18.237
Hollinsworth, I'm not talking to you.

03:18.272 --> 03:20.969
Oh, you're not talking to me, Scholfield?
Yeah, well... I'm talking to you.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.666
So what is it?
You better than everybody else?

03:23.965 --> 03:26.164
Nobody can do as good as you?
We're all idiots here?

03:26.464 --> 03:28.163
I don't see the point
of this conversation.

03:28.463 --> 03:31.461
The point is the reason why
nobody likes you.

03:33.958 --> 03:35.156
I like you.

03:45.646 --> 03:49.543
He's a little ripe, but a...
He's been dead for four days.

03:52.038 --> 03:55.233
- Who is he?
- Peter Balcour. He owned the place.

03:56.433 --> 03:57.433
Who found him?

03:57.633 --> 04:00.080
Contractor who had
an appointment with him.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.528
Seems Balcour's old man was
bit of a recluse.

04:02.727 --> 04:04.591
Owned a large fleet of fishing boats.

04:04.626 --> 04:05.923
He died a couple of months ago
and left everything to his son...

04:06.421 --> 04:08.321
Balcour had an appointment
with the contractor...

04:08.421 --> 04:09.718
...to fix the place up to sell it.

04:12.915 --> 04:14.515
Any other family?

04:14.715 --> 04:17.012
Contractor says the kid
was the end of the line.

04:17.209 --> 04:19.509
- Anything taken?
- You mean besides his arm?

04:21.805 --> 04:26.702
No. We did find his wallet in his
jacket pocket with 112 dollars in.

04:29.199 --> 04:30.897
Was he alive when
he lost the arm?

04:31.097 --> 04:34.495
Yeah. If you check out
the blood splatter.

04:34.795 --> 04:36.293
But... take a look at this.

04:37.890 --> 04:40.788
He got some kind of
strange burn effect here.

04:40.988 --> 04:43.483
And the back of his
head is all singed.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.082
- What is it?
- I don't know.

04:46.481 --> 04:49.379
I'll have to verify all that
when I get him back to the shop.

04:49.778 --> 04:50.878
Any more light in here?

04:50.978 --> 04:53.473
No, that's it. I didn't wanna touch
anything so I left the curtains closed.

04:53.972 --> 04:55.271
- Open them.
- Sure.

05:20.845 --> 05:23.342
- You finished that report?
- Yeah.

05:23.442 --> 05:23.541
- Thanks.
- OK.

05:24.940 --> 05:27.137
Do you think this guy is
somewhere in New York city?

05:27.237 --> 05:30.335
I'll get in touch with NYPD
and when they get him, I'll get his ass!

05:34.932 --> 05:37.829
Hey Jack, can I get one
of those papers?

05:38.926 --> 05:42.124
Prudhomme, Hollinsworth.
In my office.

05:45.619 --> 05:49.017
Rousch and Scholfield were just in here
bitching about you stealing their case.

05:49.217 --> 05:50.616
They can have it if they want it.

05:50.816 --> 05:54.211
This is not a democracy, Prudhomme.
It's your case.

05:54.510 --> 05:56.707
- I gave it to you.
- Then what's the problem?

05:57.007 --> 05:59.404
The problem is you pissed 'em off.

06:02.401 --> 06:05.699
Hollinsworth is the only one in the entire
department who wants to work with you.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.996
I don't know what it was
like in New Orleans...

06:08.296 --> 06:11.192
but since you came here you've gone
through one partner after another.

06:11.493 --> 06:14.689
Did you bring me in here to talk
about my social skills?

06:15.189 --> 06:17.287
Talking to you is like
pissing into the wind.

06:17.487 --> 06:19.485
I bet you should know
better by now.

06:21.182 --> 06:22.281
What've you got?

06:23.481 --> 06:27.674
Peter Balcour, 33 year old, male.

06:28.174 --> 06:30.273
Owned a fleet of fishing boats.

06:30.573 --> 06:32.771
Had his right arm cut
off at the shoulder.

06:33.070 --> 06:35.369
The killer presumably
took it with him when he left.

06:35.569 --> 06:38.167
Took it with him?
You mean like a souvenir?

06:40.362 --> 06:42.261
That's somethin' new.
Witnesses?

06:42.561 --> 06:45.458
No, but the killer
left us a message...

06:45.658 --> 06:47.455
...written in blood.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.653
- Prints?
- Forensics is checking.

06:49.853 --> 06:53.449
- We won't find any prints.
- How the hell do you know that?

06:53.749 --> 06:55.946
Because he doesn't want us to.

06:56.546 --> 07:00.242
- And also, there will be more bodies.
- You don't know that.

07:00.541 --> 07:03.639
- For all you know, this... What's his name?
- Balcour.

07:03.739 --> 07:06.137
Balcour shorted a customer
on a case of tuna.

07:06.337 --> 07:10.132
The guy cut his arm off and pulled
all this bullshit to throw us off track.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.826
The killer wrote "He is
coming" on the window.

07:14.326 --> 07:18.023
That signifies a future event
that hasn't taken place yet.

07:18.423 --> 07:22.617
This guy has something worked out
and today was just the first move.

07:23.516 --> 07:26.512
If this was all planned,
what's the motive?

07:29.411 --> 07:33.407
We already know the motive.
The killer wanted his arm.

07:33.807 --> 07:35.706
That's a motive.

07:52.888 --> 07:56.783
Would it be too much to ask to get
a cheeseburger every once in a while?

07:58.681 --> 08:01.478
What do you think
he took the arm for?

08:02.077 --> 08:04.475
We have to talk
about this over lunch?

08:04.775 --> 08:09.271
I don't know. Obviously we're not dealing with
somebody who is playing with a full deck here.

08:09.571 --> 08:11.568
God only knows what he is doing.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.264
Maybe we got another
Jeffrey Dahmer.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.160
Why not take the whole body?

08:17.460 --> 08:19.759
Maybe he only wanted a snack.

08:35.942 --> 08:39.840
Jenny called today.
She's coming to visit us.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.438
Again?

08:41.639 --> 08:44.934
Yes, again.
What, is there a problem?

08:45.134 --> 08:47.830
No but the last time she
came for a weekend...

08:48.130 --> 08:50.527
...she stayed two weeks.

08:50.727 --> 08:53.824
She's my best friend. What I'm supposed
to tell her? Stay in a hotel?

08:58.619 --> 09:00.316
Hey, you OK?

09:01.515 --> 09:03.513
Yeah. Just... thinking.

09:03.913 --> 09:08.109
About that case?
I saw it on the news.

09:09.808 --> 09:12.404
This world just keep getting sicker
and sicker everyday.

09:13.601 --> 09:15.000
Why would someone do
such a thing?

09:15.201 --> 09:16.798
I don't want to talk about it.

09:16.998 --> 09:19.596
Well, I'm not asking details.
I'm just asking your opinion.

09:19.895 --> 09:22.992
I said I don't want
to talk about it!

10:04.149 --> 10:08.746
And the fat guy says: I thought I was gonna
scream when he came out of the closet.

10:09.546 --> 10:10.545
Prudhomme.

10:12.043 --> 10:13.541
Do you know the exact cause of death?

10:13.741 --> 10:18.334
Yeah. Exsanguination. That means
he bled to death.

10:19.034 --> 10:24.529
He also has some burns on the right
side of his parietal region.

10:24.829 --> 10:28.524
Looks like he was tortured with a
taser or some kind of cattle prod.

10:28.824 --> 10:30.224
It didn't kill him but
probably knocked him out.

10:30.622 --> 10:33.718
So he was unconscious when
the arm was taken?

10:33.918 --> 10:35.817
No, unfortunately, he was.

10:36.016 --> 10:39.314
His endorphin and adrenaline levels
were incredible high in his blood.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.613
Which means he was
wide awake. He...

10:42.113 --> 10:44.310
He experienced a severe
trauma just before he died.

10:44.410 --> 10:48.005
You tell me that he waited for him
to wake up before he cut his arm off?

10:48.305 --> 10:51.101
- Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.
- How sick is that?

10:51.201 --> 10:52.099
I can also tell you that
whoever this guy is...

10:52.299 --> 10:53.299
...he knows what he is doing...

10:53.399 --> 10:56.497
...because he removed that arm
with almost surgical precision.

10:56.697 --> 11:00.393
This guy is no Jack the Ripper.
You might be interested in this.

11:02.589 --> 11:04.986
- Roman numerals.
- What's that?

11:05.185 --> 11:09.882
Oh, yeah. It's a keymark
etched in permanently.

11:18.173 --> 11:20.270
Let me check the neck.

11:34.554 --> 11:36.954
Bismark Locker Services.

11:41.649 --> 11:43.049
Over there.

11:46.944 --> 11:48.042
Bingo!

12:07.021 --> 12:08.220
Can you identify it?

12:09.919 --> 12:12.617
Brachychiton acerifolius.

12:13.016 --> 12:14.914
It's a flower from the bottle tree.

12:15.515 --> 12:16.978
Where can I find it around here?

12:17.013 --> 12:20.907
- You can't. It's indigenous to Australia.
- We're not in Australia.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.405
I can see why they
made you detective.

12:23.605 --> 12:27.501
- What about the Botanical Museum?
- I don't think so.

12:27.801 --> 12:31.097
This flower was picked
only a few days ago.

12:31.597 --> 12:35.292
There is one, however,
at the Botanical Gardens.

12:45.484 --> 12:47.083
There's your flower.

12:47.382 --> 12:49.378
- Billy?
- Got it.

13:02.265 --> 13:03.865
Hey, Prudhomme.

13:04.662 --> 13:07.159
This whole area has been
cut out and laid back in.

13:18.848 --> 13:21.344
- Pull it up.
- Why not?

13:31.533 --> 13:32.532
Oh, my God...

13:35.030 --> 13:36.228
Jesus!

13:50.614 --> 13:54.711
Call Chibley and
close this place down.

14:01.304 --> 14:04.102
How difficult could it be for someone
to get in here at night?

14:04.401 --> 14:08.895
Not very difficult. All we have is
a wall around the property.

14:09.294 --> 14:10.594
No security?

14:10.993 --> 14:14.290
This isn't a bank.
All we have are plants here.

14:14.490 --> 14:15.589
Prudhomme?

14:25.876 --> 14:26.876
Andy...

14:30.672 --> 14:32.770
His arm has been removed.

14:35.768 --> 14:37.163
What's that?

14:42.861 --> 14:45.057
This guy likes to play
with numbers, doesn't he?

14:52.250 --> 14:55.748
Prints identify him as
Matthew Leesan, age 33.

14:56.147 --> 14:57.844
He works for the I.R.S.

14:58.044 --> 15:00.543
At least our killer's taste
in victims is improving.

15:00.743 --> 15:05.338
He was killed before Balcour
and at a different location.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.634
The killer moved his
body to the Gardens.

15:07.934 --> 15:10.431
Why go to all that trouble?
Risk being seen?

15:10.531 --> 15:12.030
What about the numbers
on the victims?

15:12.230 --> 15:13.927
- Actually, they're numerals.
- What?

15:14.027 --> 15:15.926
- They're roman numerals.
- And numerals aren't numbers?

15:16.226 --> 15:21.120
All I'm saying is I think the killer
choose numerals for a reason.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.017
119...

15:24.216 --> 15:27.713
2427.

15:28.711 --> 15:30.511
Numbers, numerals.

15:30.711 --> 15:33.606
So far, we've only found
what he wanted us to find.

15:33.806 --> 15:37.104
No prints. No trace evidence. Nothing.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.798
What we have here is a
very clever serial killer.

15:43.296 --> 15:45.495
Guys, the lab just called down.

15:45.994 --> 15:48.092
The blood on the window
wasn't Balcour's.

15:48.292 --> 15:51.390
- Whose was it? Killer's?
- It wasn't anybody's.

15:51.990 --> 15:53.585
Lab says it wasn't human.

15:53.885 --> 15:55.786
Says it was lamb's blood.

16:31.147 --> 16:32.947
Do you wanna play?

16:34.444 --> 16:36.142
That's it, my baby.

16:37.041 --> 16:39.040
You wanna play?

17:38.377 --> 17:39.676
No!

17:56.358 --> 17:57.357
- Who called it in?
- I did.

17:57.657 --> 17:59.756
- Where is it?
- Just over here.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.151
Right down here, gentleman.

18:05.549 --> 18:07.748
Watch yourselves,
it's a mess down here.

18:07.948 --> 18:11.145
Transients, druggies, whatever...

18:13.439 --> 18:16.037
All sorts of shit
happens down here.

18:16.936 --> 18:18.535
Fuck! It stinks!

18:18.735 --> 18:22.334
Yeah, it's too easy to go outside
to relieve themselves.

18:22.533 --> 18:26.727
- How did you come across him?
- One of his buddies flagged us down.

18:37.914 --> 18:40.313
Rats in this city!

18:44.207 --> 18:47.206
Here is something you
don't see every day.

18:49.303 --> 18:50.902
He's in there.

19:14.277 --> 19:15.775
Oh my God!

19:19.072 --> 19:20.271
Oh my God!

19:26.964 --> 19:28.561
Oh my God!

19:29.860 --> 19:31.458
What's this guy got?

19:31.558 --> 19:34.256
Fucking shopping list or something?

19:35.455 --> 19:37.455
Where's his head?

19:42.049 --> 19:46.444
There's a guy sitting in front of me here
without his head, John. Where's his head?

19:48.242 --> 19:49.641
I'm sorry.

19:55.337 --> 19:56.936
Where is Chibley?

19:57.135 --> 19:58.732
He's on his way.

20:02.328 --> 20:06.123
One plastic comb, about
1.25 in change and a pack of gum.

20:06.423 --> 20:09.721
Oh yeah, and a wallet.
One James Ordway.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.120
- You done?
- Yeah.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.617
I got a pretty good
idea what killed him.

20:13.817 --> 20:15.913
- Is this the scene?
- No.

20:16.212 --> 20:19.310
The killer cut him in here...

20:19.510 --> 20:23.306
strung him up and then he
bled him like a stuck pig.

20:23.705 --> 20:26.103
Then he dragged him back in there,
cleaned him up...

20:26.303 --> 20:29.997
...and sat him on the throne
for a dramatic effect.

20:30.995 --> 20:33.594
- I gotta get some air.
- You're welcome.

20:40.388 --> 20:42.185
- Any witnesses?
- No.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.282
What? No witnesses?
No witnesses?

20:45.481 --> 20:47.478
- Are you kidding me?
- We talked to everyone in the building...

20:47.578 --> 20:48.877
...no one saw anything.
No one heard anything.

20:49.076 --> 20:51.677
Wait a minute! You're kidding me.
A guy gets in here...

20:51.777 --> 20:53.275
...cuts another guy's head off...

20:53.573 --> 20:56.174
...walks off with it
and nobody sees anything?

20:56.273 --> 20:58.272
No witnesses! Fuck!

20:58.771 --> 21:02.066
I swear to God, man. I've
been on the job 8 years...

21:02.366 --> 21:06.560
...I've never seen anythin'
like this. Never!

21:08.059 --> 21:12.256
- He wants to shock us.
- He's doin' a good job.

21:13.254 --> 21:14.554
Let's go.

21:18.148 --> 21:21.445
We found the victim's wallet.
Driver's license ID'd him as James Ordway.

21:21.844 --> 21:22.609
Are we sure it's him?

21:22.644 --> 21:25.042
Yeah. We checked the prints
against the license. It's him.

21:25.142 --> 21:28.039
Leesan was killed 2 weeks ago,
Balcour one week ago...

21:28.239 --> 21:30.336
- Ordway, last night.
- We're up to speed.

21:30.536 --> 21:33.132
I had the lab blow up
his license photo.

21:49.014 --> 21:53.711
2427...

22:02.801 --> 22:04.702
119...

22:05.101 --> 22:09.895
Numbers...
1 plus 1 plus 9. 2.

22:13.192 --> 22:18.586
2 plus 4...

22:30.575 --> 22:34.569
4 plus 2 plus 7...

22:35.367 --> 22:39.563
5... Doesn't make sense.
Doesn't make sense.

22:55.347 --> 23:02.042
Peter, 119...
119...

23:05.937 --> 23:09.631
Peter 1:19...

23:11.830 --> 23:14.130
My God! Peter 1:19...

23:14.328 --> 23:16.626
Mathew 24:27...

23:28.913 --> 23:31.911
Peter, Matthew, James.
All names of apostles.

23:32.210 --> 23:35.805
Peter was a fisherman. Balcour
owned a fishing fleet.

23:36.105 --> 23:39.701
Mathew was a tax collector.
Leesan worked for the I.R.S.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.299
So the guy is some kind
of a zealot?

23:42.799 --> 23:46.793
The numbers he carved on the victims
are chapter and verses from the Bible.

23:47.193 --> 23:51.586
Peter, chapter 1, verse 19.
119.

23:51.986 --> 23:54.686
"But with precious blood
as of a lamb...

23:54.885 --> 23:58.282
...unblemished and
unspotted. Christ...

23:58.781 --> 24:01.081
...a message was written
in lamb's blood".

24:01.580 --> 24:03.978
Matthew, 24:27.

24:04.277 --> 24:08.872
"For as the lightning cometh out of the
east, and shineth unto the west,

24:09.272 --> 24:12.867
so shall also be the coming
of the Son of man".

24:13.566 --> 24:16.764
All the victims were 33 years old.
The same age as Christ...

24:16.963 --> 24:18.261
...when he died.

24:18.561 --> 24:21.157
All three died a week
apart of each other...

24:21.357 --> 24:23.455
...on a Friday, the
same day Christ died.

24:23.655 --> 24:26.352
The guy is rebuilding
the body of Christ.

24:26.852 --> 24:29.149
You say he's actually
rebuilding a body?

24:29.349 --> 24:33.247
Yes. He's killed a person a week
for the last 3 weeks.

24:33.347 --> 24:34.245
He's halfway through.

24:34.545 --> 24:37.141
If he stays on his Friday schedule,
that'll take 3 more weeks.

24:37.341 --> 24:41.137
- What's 3 weeks from now?
- Easter.

24:41.736 --> 24:43.335
The resurrection.

24:47.530 --> 24:49.530
Scholfield, you and Rousch
contact...

24:49.729 --> 24:51.924
...every seminar, school
and church in the area.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.222
Check on zealots,
disturbed personalities...

24:54.522 --> 24:56.122
Anyone who might fit the profile.

24:56.321 --> 24:59.119
Moltz, check the mental institutions...

24:59.319 --> 25:02.517
- ... see if they ever treated anyone that could be our boy.
- Got it.

25:02.816 --> 25:07.010
The rest should canvas the crime scenes again.
Somebody had to see something!

25:19.697 --> 25:20.897
Care a beer later?

25:21.197 --> 25:24.791
No I can't, I promised Sara
I'd go to the market...

25:25.091 --> 25:27.188
...so the house is stocked
when Jenny comes in.

25:28.388 --> 25:32.784
What's the story with this Jenny?
Is she cute?

25:35.780 --> 25:37.177
I guess so.

25:37.676 --> 25:40.874
You guess so? She's cute.
She's cute, right?

25:41.173 --> 25:43.371
OK, so what's the problem?
You know I'm cute.

25:43.471 --> 25:46.071
Can we make a little connection here?
You'll hook us up?

25:46.370 --> 25:51.166
I don't know... That's all I need is for her start
liking you and I've to see her longer.

25:51.465 --> 25:54.659
No, no. That's good.
She likes me, she can stay with me.

25:54.959 --> 25:57.058
It's all good. We all win.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.255
Are you really that desperate?

26:01.054 --> 26:03.653
Yeah. I really am.

26:32.721 --> 26:36.018
Father Rousell dropped by
to see how we're doing.

26:36.418 --> 26:40.212
- Good to see you, John.
- What brings you by, Father?

26:40.612 --> 26:43.608
Well, it's been 6 months
since you've been to church.

26:44.008 --> 26:45.907
I just wanted to see how you're doing.

26:48.204 --> 26:49.902
I'm fine.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.200
Will you sit down?
I'll just get some coffee.

26:53.898 --> 26:55.395
I'm just fine.

26:56.795 --> 26:59.793
You shouldn't turn your
back on your faith.

27:00.293 --> 27:01.691
God loves you, John.

27:01.991 --> 27:03.890
His love can help you heal.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.188
Oh, I've seen how he loves me.

27:06.788 --> 27:10.082
My son was in a coma
for 5 days.

27:10.382 --> 27:12.880
You know how many times I prayed?

27:13.280 --> 27:16.075
Where was my God when
I needed him?

27:23.669 --> 27:28.762
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright. It's alright.

27:35.956 --> 27:38.952
What the hell were
you thinking, Sara?

27:40.449 --> 27:42.348
I can't reach you anymore.

27:42.647 --> 27:44.845
I'm right here.

27:50.938 --> 27:53.837
I'm worried about you.

27:54.336 --> 27:56.731
I'm worried about us.

27:57.231 --> 27:58.630
What do you want from me?

27:59.229 --> 28:01.428
I want you to talk to me.

28:01.928 --> 28:03.925
Will you please just
talk to me?

28:09.523 --> 28:13.518
It's been 1 year
since Michael died...

28:13.917 --> 28:16.414
...and you have not visited
his grave since the funeral.

28:18.211 --> 28:19.811
You don't understand.

28:20.110 --> 28:24.807
You are not the only
one who lost a child!

28:30.198 --> 28:31.897
I'm sorry.

28:32.596 --> 28:33.495
I'm sorry.

28:35.894 --> 28:37.492
I'm so sorry.

28:37.592 --> 28:39.590
I didn't mean that.

28:52.374 --> 28:54.373
- Morning, John.
- Hi.

28:55.373 --> 28:59.566
So he says: we finally get back
together and she gets hit by a bus.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.858
This isn't a joke?

29:11.058 --> 29:15.752
No. My cousin's girlfriend
got hit by a bus last night.

29:16.750 --> 29:19.347
I'm sorry. How is she doing?

29:20.146 --> 29:22.446
She's got a broken leg.

29:28.238 --> 29:31.734
- Smooth, John, smooth.
- I thought it was a joke.

29:34.931 --> 29:36.530
What's so funny?

29:36.830 --> 29:39.627
- You had to be there.
- What've you got?

29:39.727 --> 29:43.921
Since your press conference last night
we've received about 50 calls.

29:44.220 --> 29:46.918
We've got people accusing everyone
from their mother-in-law to the mayor.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.817
Well, the mayor might not be
a bad lead.

29:49.016 --> 29:52.015
I got someone in my office you
guys should talk to.

29:52.513 --> 29:53.711
- Who is he?
- FBI profiler.

29:54.110 --> 29:56.708
- C'mon, Jack...
- OK, he's trying to help,

29:56.809 --> 29:59.604
...alright? This guy solved a lot of cases.
- What is he gonna tell me?

29:59.804 --> 30:01.202
I'm looking for a white male...

30:01.402 --> 30:04.400
- ... 25 to 45 years old?
- Just talk to him!

30:09.197 --> 30:10.896
Prudhomme, Hollinsworth,
agent Wingate.

30:11.095 --> 30:12.594
Nice to meet you.

30:14.789 --> 30:18.585
I understand you might
have something for us.

30:18.985 --> 30:21.183
Well, I thought maybe
I could help...

30:21.483 --> 30:23.381
...though I've never come across
a serial killer who's moved...

30:23.581 --> 30:25.080
...at such an accelerated pace.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.377
How do you know what pace
he's moving at?

30:27.578 --> 30:29.873
Your captain let me
look through the files.

30:30.073 --> 30:31.071
Did he?

30:31.571 --> 30:34.968
Based on what I've seen so far, you're looking
for someone of above average intelligence.

30:35.269 --> 30:38.066
White male, 25 to 45 years old...

30:40.664 --> 30:41.563
Something funny?

30:41.663 --> 30:44.657
- No, no. Go on.
- I'm sorry.

30:45.856 --> 30:48.454
He'll be middle class,
a loner, not married.

30:48.654 --> 30:51.651
Those who know him will
find him aloof but cordial.

30:51.951 --> 30:55.446
Although he prefers isolation,
he has the ability to navigate...

30:55.746 --> 30:56.846
...in social settings when he has to.

30:56.945 --> 31:00.441
He will have strong moral
and religious convictions.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.338
Obviously his moral convictions
don't include murder.

31:03.637 --> 31:05.637
He doesn't view what he's
doing as murder.

31:05.836 --> 31:08.834
To him, he's making
sacrifices to God.

31:09.533 --> 31:13.031
What point is there in keeping his
victims conscious while he mutilates them?

31:13.630 --> 31:15.526
Christ suffered on the cross.

31:15.726 --> 31:17.525
He wants his victims to suffer.

31:17.625 --> 31:20.521
But leaving clues behind
puts him at risk.

31:20.621 --> 31:22.019
He want us to know what he's doin'.

31:22.519 --> 31:23.919
True. But there's more
to it than that.

31:24.018 --> 31:26.016
If he merely wanted you
to know what he was doing...

31:26.051 --> 31:27.016
...there're more direct ways to inform you.

31:27.516 --> 31:29.913
The clues he leaves give
him a sense of power.

31:30.413 --> 31:32.707
And shows he's in control.

31:34.306 --> 31:37.004
Prudhomme, this fax just came in for you.
I think you should take a look at it.

31:39.701 --> 31:44.596
You have heard the voice of the prophet
as he prepares the throne of grace...

31:45.495 --> 31:48.092
...and you've twisted his message.

31:48.991 --> 31:52.488
Those who die, do so
for the glory of God.

31:52.788 --> 31:55.285
Spread the true gospel
before the end...

31:55.485 --> 32:00.381
of the Boanerges, or you shall
be judged by me.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.476
What makes you think this is him?

32:02.576 --> 32:03.375
Read the bottom.

32:04.574 --> 32:10.370
So you do not doubt... Inside
the third one is the key to the mount.

32:11.469 --> 32:13.568
May I? Third one?

32:14.567 --> 32:15.666
Ordway.

32:18.362 --> 32:20.260
Ordway, James.

32:21.159 --> 32:22.158
Come in.

32:22.655 --> 32:24.155
Where's Ordway's body?

32:24.255 --> 32:26.153
I just finished the autopsy.
I'm making out the report now.

32:26.353 --> 32:29.151
You can have it in... you can
have it by this afternoon.

32:29.450 --> 32:32.247
- Anything unusual?
- No. Not really.

32:33.246 --> 32:36.142
Except all he'd been
eating was olives.

32:36.341 --> 32:38.540
His stomach was full of them.

32:39.039 --> 32:41.637
- Mount of olives.
- It's him.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.434
See ya.

32:48.128 --> 32:49.728
This guy is fucking with us.

32:49.927 --> 32:52.324
He let you into his world
so you can publicise his work.

32:52.424 --> 32:54.823
He knows you know
what he's doing.

32:55.123 --> 32:57.020
Your failure to acknowledge it
has angered him.

32:57.220 --> 33:00.616
So he's going to kill again tomorrow
and there's nothing we can do to stop him.

33:01.116 --> 33:03.812
Can you run a search through
your database...

33:04.112 --> 33:06.110
...and see if you have anything
similar on file?

33:06.145 --> 33:08.109
No problem. Here's my direct
line at the Bureau...

33:08.309 --> 33:11.206
...and my cell phone number
will be on the back.

33:12.506 --> 33:14.904
Call me if there's anything I can do.

33:15.304 --> 33:16.703
Thank you.

33:38.677 --> 33:40.875
They've already got a name for him.

33:43.073 --> 33:44.373
It sells papers.

33:45.871 --> 33:47.768
What do you think makes
someone this crazy?

33:48.168 --> 33:49.765
Who knows?

33:49.865 --> 33:52.662
Problems mount,
pressures grow...

33:54.460 --> 33:57.159
One day you start to slip
through the cracks...

33:57.658 --> 33:59.854
...and there's no one there
to catch you.

34:00.754 --> 34:01.552
Happens every day.

34:01.952 --> 34:04.450
I'll tell you one thing for sure,
I'll feel a hell of a lot better...

34:04.649 --> 34:07.646
knowing that he's drooling on
himself in a padded cell somewhere.

34:09.344 --> 34:11.043
You're assuming we're
gonna catch him?

34:12.442 --> 34:14.041
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

34:14.141 --> 34:15.442
Assuming we're
gonna catch him?

34:15.641 --> 34:19.137
It means that either we'll catch him or
he'll finish what he is doing...

34:19.335 --> 34:22.733
...and disappear like Jack the Ripper
and the Zodiac Killer.

34:23.032 --> 34:26.527
Or, come Easter, he'll realize all he has
is a rottin' corpse in his garage...

34:26.726 --> 34:28.627
So he'd figure he fucked up
his little recipe...

34:28.826 --> 34:31.024
...and start all over
again for next year.

34:32.223 --> 34:35.618
I don't know if he really believes
he's creating the second coming.

34:35.918 --> 34:38.014
I think it's more symbolic.

34:38.415 --> 34:40.413
He's sending a message.

34:40.713 --> 34:43.710
- Yeah? To whom?
- To us. The world.

34:44.010 --> 34:45.608
The guy is a fucking nutcase!

34:45.708 --> 34:48.007
All this religious mumbo jumbo
is bullshit!

34:48.206 --> 34:50.501
You don't think the guy is at home
right now, reading these headlines...

34:51.301 --> 34:53.498
...and jerking himself off?
He loves the attention...

34:53.533 --> 34:55.197
He wants the attention!

34:56.196 --> 34:58.595
I'm not doubting he's insane.

34:59.095 --> 35:01.890
But don't discount his intelligence.

35:02.590 --> 35:05.088
You think you just go out
and you find a 33 year old guy...

35:05.288 --> 35:07.882
...named Peter who happens
to be a fisherman?

35:08.982 --> 35:12.080
Or someone named Matthew
who is a tax collector?

35:12.879 --> 35:16.577
Don't you see planning
that's got into this? The time.

35:16.877 --> 35:20.173
Stop admiring him. He kills people.
Let's not lose sight of that.

35:20.373 --> 35:24.168
I admire the intellect,
not the action.

35:25.665 --> 35:28.762
Do you know how difficult
it is to get away with murder?

35:29.763 --> 35:32.460
There're 50 ways
to fuck up a crime.

35:33.060 --> 35:36.257
And if you can think of 20
of them you're a genius.

35:36.555 --> 35:39.352
So far, this guy is batting
a thousand.

36:07.621 --> 36:14.915
...just to find thy words...
... the faith of the son of God...

36:15.215 --> 36:22.009
Spread the true gospel before
the end of the... Boanerges...

36:22.308 --> 36:26.504
You shall be judged by him.

36:29.499 --> 36:31.298
Boanerges...

36:31.897 --> 36:35.393
From the Greek, sons of thunder...

36:35.593 --> 36:39.089
...an epithet used by Jesus.

36:39.388 --> 36:44.984
Sons of thunder...
Seems to be 2 people or more.

37:20.448 --> 37:21.548
Who is it?

37:22.646 --> 37:24.342
It's John Prudhomme!

37:28.938 --> 37:31.835
- John, it's very late.
- I'm sorry, Father.

37:31.935 --> 37:35.132
I need to talk to you,
it's important.

37:35.432 --> 37:37.329
- Well, come in.
- Thanks.

37:41.124 --> 37:41.923
Is everything alright?

37:42.223 --> 37:46.020
Yeah. I need some information
on the... Bonaerges.

37:46.219 --> 37:48.617
- The what?
- The Boa-ner-ges.

37:48.817 --> 37:50.617
Oh, it's pronounced Boa-ner-ges.

37:50.817 --> 37:55.508
Yeah, whatever. I... I know it
means sons of thunder.

37:55.808 --> 37:57.607
Whose sons?

37:57.907 --> 37:59.805
- Zebedee.
- Who is he?

38:00.105 --> 38:02.203
He's only mentioned in the Bible
in relation to his sons.

38:02.403 --> 38:05.101
- Yeah, where in the Bible?
- You should know this.

38:05.301 --> 38:08.897
Listen Father, I don't have time
for a Bible class right now.

38:09.196 --> 38:11.492
Well, come with me.

38:18.886 --> 38:20.484
Here it is.

38:30.074 --> 38:32.171
Mark, 3:17.

38:35.869 --> 38:39.665
James is son of Zebedee
and John, the brother of James...

38:39.765 --> 38:44.958
...and he surnamed them the Boanerges...
which is the sons of thunder.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.156
John, the brother of James?

38:48.555 --> 38:49.653
Yes.

38:49.753 --> 38:51.152
Thank you, Father.

38:53.550 --> 38:55.448
Ordway has a brother.
His name is John.

38:55.648 --> 38:59.242
He's going to be the fourth victim.
I need an address, fast. Thanks.

39:04.038 --> 39:06.237
John Ordway, photographer.
He has a work studio...

39:06.437 --> 39:08.434
- at 1432, Baker Street.
- Home address?

39:08.534 --> 39:10.533
The studio is
his home address.

39:10.633 --> 39:11.894
OK, I'm ten minutes away.

39:11.929 --> 39:14.527
Call him and tell him to lock himself in
and wait for me.

39:14.827 --> 39:16.226
I'll meet you there.

39:33.307 --> 39:35.607
I talked to him and told
him to lock himself in.

39:39.902 --> 39:42.898
Call for backup and
check the perimeter.

39:55.685 --> 39:58.879
Detective Hollinsworth requesting
backup at 1432, Baker Street.

42:10.344 --> 42:11.642
Hang on! Hang on!

42:13.840 --> 42:16.437
Oh God! Hang on!

42:18.034 --> 42:19.334
Hang on!

42:27.928 --> 42:29.226
Oh my God!

42:44.709 --> 42:46.410
God!

43:11.981 --> 43:14.877
I think he's still here.

43:30.363 --> 43:32.061
He's here! He's here!

44:06.823 --> 44:08.821
- Are you OK?
- He fucking got by me!

44:09.221 --> 44:10.520
Where did he go?

45:06.560 --> 45:07.958
Let's split up!

45:34.534 --> 45:37.430
- I want a 10-block perimeter set.
- I'm on it.

45:37.530 --> 45:38.628
Close the roof!

46:06.997 --> 46:09.794
You two take the alley.
We'll take the street!

46:44.259 --> 46:45.259
Freeze!

46:51.353 --> 46:52.850
Put your hands on your head!

46:53.850 --> 46:55.347
He's got a gun!

46:55.547 --> 46:56.446
Drop the weapon!
Drop the weapon, now!

47:00.443 --> 47:02.141
Put it down!

47:02.241 --> 47:04.939
Drop it and put up
your hands right now!

47:05.738 --> 47:07.136
Don't shoot!

47:19.522 --> 47:21.520
No! No! No!

47:21.921 --> 47:22.820
Shit!

47:23.318 --> 47:25.214
The gun was taped to his fuckin' hand!

47:25.314 --> 47:27.013
No!

47:28.413 --> 47:31.410
Get an ambulance!
Get an ambulance!

47:31.809 --> 47:34.409
- Take it easy!
- God!

47:36.307 --> 47:38.701
No! Oh, no!

47:42.500 --> 47:44.597
I can't... I can't feel my leg.

47:45.596 --> 47:46.995
- I can't feel my leg!
- Can't you give him something?

47:47.095 --> 47:48.394
- I did. It doesn't seem to work!
- I can't see my leg!

47:48.494 --> 47:49.792
- Can you see my leg?
- Hold on!

47:50.092 --> 47:52.491
We'll be at the hospital
in few minutes.

47:53.689 --> 47:57.882
Andy, 2 boys are sharing
the hospital room...

47:58.281 --> 48:03.978
...so, one boy asked the other
what he's there for...

48:04.376 --> 48:06.675
...so the boy says: circumcision...

48:07.474 --> 48:12.166
The other boy says: Oh man,
I'd that done right after I was born...

48:12.466 --> 48:15.463
...and I couldn't walk for a year.

48:16.563 --> 48:19.360
It was... It's the worst fucking
joke I ever heard, John.

48:22.157 --> 48:23.357
I know.

48:28.949 --> 48:31.048
- How are you, Jack?
- Sara.

48:31.348 --> 48:34.245
- How is he?
- We don't know yet.

48:45.733 --> 48:47.431
Bone's completely shattered.

48:47.531 --> 48:50.529
We've stopped the bleeding
but we'll have to amputate.

48:51.529 --> 48:53.826
There has to be something
else you can do.

48:54.226 --> 48:56.422
If there was, detective,
I'd be doing it.

49:18.899 --> 49:21.296
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:21.794 --> 49:25.392
- How you doin'?
- I'm OK.

49:28.486 --> 49:31.485
They wanna take my leg.
They wanna take my leg.

49:32.484 --> 49:33.783
I know.

49:34.583 --> 49:35.881
Don't let 'em take my leg.

49:36.981 --> 49:38.880
Please, don't let 'em take my leg.

49:40.078 --> 49:42.274
John, please, don't let 'em
take my leg!

49:46.869 --> 49:48.367
I'm scared. I'm scared.

49:50.066 --> 49:52.065
I'm... I'm scared!

50:31.921 --> 50:33.321
What the hell is he doing?

50:34.919 --> 50:38.917
It's a... an old Cajun superstition.

50:39.916 --> 50:43.210
When someone's suffering,
you put a knife under the bed...

50:44.110 --> 50:46.008
and... it cuts the pain in half.

51:03.389 --> 51:04.788
What are you doin' here?

51:05.687 --> 51:06.487
I'm working.

51:06.586 --> 51:08.784
John, go home. Get some rest.

51:09.185 --> 51:10.482
I'm not tired.

51:11.282 --> 51:12.280
In my office.

51:22.071 --> 51:25.566
John, I want you to
take a few days off.

51:25.766 --> 51:27.465
We can't waste any more time.

51:27.666 --> 51:29.661
That's really how you see it?
Isn't it?

51:29.861 --> 51:32.658
If you're not here, the rest of us are
just plodding along in the dark.

51:32.957 --> 51:35.457
- I didn't...
- You seeing those guys out there?

51:36.255 --> 51:37.954
Those are detectives.

51:38.454 --> 51:40.453
They do the same
job as you.

51:40.653 --> 51:42.152
I know that.

51:42.951 --> 51:46.546
I also know we
had him last night.

51:47.244 --> 51:51.539
He was standing in the
same room with me. And got away.

51:52.339 --> 51:54.237
Don't take me off this, Jack.

51:57.334 --> 51:58.133
Alright.

51:59.433 --> 52:00.430
Thanks.

52:01.528 --> 52:04.726
What do you think he's gonna do?
I mean, you interrupted him last night.

52:04.926 --> 52:06.524
He didn't get what he came for.

52:07.723 --> 52:10.721
If he wants to stay
on schedule for Easter...

52:11.120 --> 52:13.616
He's gonna have to
make up for lost time.

52:14.416 --> 52:15.613
So are you.

52:20.408 --> 52:21.307
John.

52:23.107 --> 52:26.901
- We just want you to know that...
- Thanks guys.

52:27.001 --> 52:28.200
Thank you.

52:43.688 --> 52:46.582
There's a Dr. Nestler
on line one for you.

52:48.682 --> 52:51.378
- Hi, doctor.
- We've a problem over here...

52:51.478 --> 52:53.175
...that I thought you
should know about.

52:53.275 --> 52:55.374
I thought the operation
went fine.

52:55.674 --> 52:56.972
It did.

52:57.472 --> 52:59.870
I... I don't understand.

53:00.069 --> 53:03.763
One of our orderlies was
found unconscious down there.

53:04.063 --> 53:05.462
Someone beat the hell out of him.

53:05.661 --> 53:08.759
- I'll send an officer over.
- The police are already here.

53:08.959 --> 53:10.058
Detective...

53:10.158 --> 53:13.455
The orderly was carrying
an appendage downstairs.

53:13.955 --> 53:16.351
Somebody stole your partner's leg.

53:27.538 --> 53:28.538
Can I see him?

53:28.738 --> 53:31.836
He's still pretty groggy.
Try not to be long.

53:32.034 --> 53:33.231
Thanks.

53:50.617 --> 53:54.811
I wanted to stop by
and see how you were doing.

53:58.010 --> 53:59.308
You need anything?

54:00.506 --> 54:03.003
Yeah. A leg.

54:04.102 --> 54:05.500
You got one?

54:08.297 --> 54:10.095
I'm sorry.

54:12.394 --> 54:13.593
I'm so sorry.

54:15.891 --> 54:19.885
Hey, you know... When I was
coming out of the alley...

54:22.681 --> 54:27.576
I was... I was...
I could hear you screaming.

54:29.374 --> 54:33.770
I just... I never imagined that
you were screaming at me.

54:34.668 --> 54:40.663
I must have been pretty out of it,
from the stunt gun.

54:42.161 --> 54:44.160
I just get...

54:44.961 --> 54:47.458
I just get moving towards
the sound of your voice.

54:55.047 --> 54:56.946
I love being a cop.

54:59.446 --> 55:01.642
It's all I ever wanted to be.

55:02.042 --> 55:04.141
Far back as I can remember.

55:04.439 --> 55:08.733
A cop.
Helping people.

55:10.033 --> 55:12.031
Righting wrongs.

55:13.030 --> 55:15.528
You know what I mean?
That's the finest thing you can be.

55:18.824 --> 55:21.721
Oh man... Oh man...

55:22.021 --> 55:24.917
What am I gonna do now, John?

55:26.615 --> 55:28.913
What am I gonna do now?

55:36.104 --> 55:38.801
You can go, you know?
You can go.

55:39.702 --> 55:41.999
I just want to be
left alone, alright?

55:43.299 --> 55:44.397
Go on. Go!

56:11.468 --> 56:13.967
- Wingate.
- John Prudhomme.

56:17.963 --> 56:19.561
Thank you.

56:20.061 --> 56:22.256
You’re lettin' him inside your
head. You can't do that.

56:22.757 --> 56:25.054
How am I not to do that?

56:25.453 --> 56:27.652
You divorce yourself from
the emotions.

56:27.951 --> 56:28.951
What?

56:30.251 --> 56:33.146
Turn it off like a light switch?

56:33.745 --> 56:35.644
Right now, there is a cop...

56:36.841 --> 56:38.739
a friend...

56:39.338 --> 56:41.538
Who will never be the same
because of me.

56:41.737 --> 56:43.435
You're doing exactly
what he wants you to do.

56:43.535 --> 56:44.635
You're concentrating on your guilt.

56:44.835 --> 56:48.532
I got my fucking partner
shot last night!

56:48.932 --> 56:51.428
What the fuck are you
looking at?

56:55.424 --> 56:57.521
How can I help you,
Prudhomme?

56:57.720 --> 56:59.819
I assume there are others
you can talk to...

57:00.019 --> 57:03.116
- ... if you just wanted to vent.
- Sorry.

57:04.514 --> 57:09.207
I think last night was my best shot
at catching this guy and I fucked it up.

57:10.407 --> 57:12.604
I don't know where
to go from here.

57:13.204 --> 57:15.901
If you can't go forwards,
go backwards.

57:16.201 --> 57:18.800
Back up. Who is he?
What do you know about him?

57:20.198 --> 57:22.295
He wants to kill?

57:22.395 --> 57:24.292
I mean, he's insane.

57:25.691 --> 57:28.089
I've spent years studying these guys.
They've all got their excuses.

57:28.289 --> 57:30.987
Fathers who beat them,
mothers who raped them...

57:31.187 --> 57:32.685
Voices tellin' them what to do...

57:32.885 --> 57:34.382
The bottom line is,
except for a very small percentage...

57:34.482 --> 57:36.482
...they all know
they're committing murder.

57:37.180 --> 57:40.974
He thinks he's rebuilding the body
of Christ. If that is not insane...

57:41.174 --> 57:43.973
His actions don't define
his state of mind.

57:44.173 --> 57:46.271
Look at Dahmer,
Casey, Bundy...

57:46.470 --> 57:48.468
They all committed horrible
acts. But they were sane.

57:48.669 --> 57:50.568
The fact that he's careful
not to leave any evidence behind...

57:50.768 --> 57:54.461
.. shows he's aware there are
consequences to his actions.

57:54.762 --> 57:56.060
Look...

57:56.260 --> 57:58.758
I don't care if he's sane or not...

57:58.958 --> 58:00.955
I just wanna catch him.

58:01.155 --> 58:03.653
You couldn't catch a cold,
the way you're thinking.

58:03.753 --> 58:05.052
Thanks.

58:05.951 --> 58:08.349
Stop focusing on
his state of mind.

58:08.647 --> 58:12.242
Look for the pattern.
Whatever he thinks he's doing...

58:12.542 --> 58:13.940
...or creating, that's what
drives him to murder.

58:14.140 --> 58:16.539
What he is doing isn't as
important as why he is doing it.

58:16.739 --> 58:20.935
If you can figure that out
it'll lead you to him.

58:22.333 --> 58:26.028
- You really should eat.
- No, thanks.

58:33.620 --> 58:36.417
This came for you
while you were out.

58:37.918 --> 58:40.311
How is Hollinsworth doing?

58:41.811 --> 58:44.210
- You didn't see him?
- Yeah, I saw him.

58:44.410 --> 58:47.407
- Anything else?
- Nothing.

58:48.006 --> 58:51.104
The computer gave us a couple of names
that could be our boy, but...

58:51.204 --> 58:53.703
...they're all in prison
or in the loony bin.

58:53.901 --> 58:56.698
It would appear I
underestimated you.

58:56.998 --> 58:59.694
Sometimes, I'm too clever
for my own good.

59:00.094 --> 59:01.691
It won't happen again.

59:02.991 --> 59:06.988
You must admit there's a strange
irony to last night's events.

59:07.287 --> 59:09.785
In the end,
I got what I wanted.

59:10.682 --> 59:15.677
John would have been better
but Andrew was an apostle also.

59:17.175 --> 59:19.673
I was hoping not to
make this personal.

59:19.873 --> 59:22.170
I warned you that
you would be judged...

59:22.205 --> 59:24.468
...if you did not tell the
world of my work.

59:25.067 --> 59:26.165
Your lack of contrition...

59:28.962 --> 59:29.362
...leaves me no choice
but to punish you.

59:30.061 --> 59:34.458
Your penitence shall be remorse.

59:35.056 --> 59:39.552
Remorse for the death
of your wife.

59:39.852 --> 59:41.314
There's a unit in the area!

59:41.349 --> 59:43.246
Send them over, now!
Get out of the way!

01:00:24.407 --> 01:00:26.703
- Sir, you have to stop right there!
- I live here!

01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:29.400
- Believe me, you don't wanna go inside!
- Let me go!

01:00:34.295 --> 01:00:35.395
John...

01:00:36.492 --> 01:00:39.290
I'm taking care of this now.

01:00:41.288 --> 01:00:42.985
You don't need to see this.

01:00:43.084 --> 01:00:49.279
No. No. No!

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.376
John, c'mon. C'mon!

01:00:55.674 --> 01:00:58.369
You don't need to be here.
Step outside.

01:00:58.469 --> 01:01:02.665
No! No!

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:09.860
C'mon, John.
Step outside!

01:01:13.954 --> 01:01:15.852
John, don't touch anything.

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:18.949
This is a crime scene.

01:01:24.644 --> 01:01:26.043
Jenny!

01:01:28.737 --> 01:01:30.237
Jenny.

01:01:41.525 --> 01:01:45.818
I'm pulling you off this.
It's gone too far.

01:01:46.318 --> 01:01:48.818
He came to my house...

01:01:49.316 --> 01:01:50.815
...to kill my wife.

01:01:51.115 --> 01:01:54.312
Which is why you're
off this thing.

01:01:54.613 --> 01:01:56.411
It's personal now.

01:01:56.711 --> 01:01:58.609
You can't do this.

01:01:58.908 --> 01:02:02.804
It's done. I'm giving it
to Rousch and Scholfield.

01:02:41.462 --> 01:02:45.258
I went out to get
something special for dinner.

01:02:47.754 --> 01:02:50.953
Jenny was tired from the trip.

01:02:51.252 --> 01:02:53.251
We don't have to talk
about it now.

01:02:54.949 --> 01:02:57.948
Why would someone do
such a thing?

01:03:06.536 --> 01:03:08.035
It was him.

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:12.432
The guy who is killing
all these people.

01:03:13.429 --> 01:03:16.027
He was trying to hurt me.

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:19.423
By killing Jenny?

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:25.517
Oh, my God!
He was trying to kill me!

01:03:26.116 --> 01:03:28.615
I thought I'd lost you.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:37.604
I want you to go stay with
your mother until this is over.

01:03:37.804 --> 01:03:38.903
But, John...

01:03:39.803 --> 01:03:41.301
Sara, please.

01:03:52.089 --> 01:03:52.889
Good evening.

01:03:52.989 --> 01:03:53.987
As it has been, our top story
tonight continues to be...

01:03:56.586 --> 01:03:59.284
...the ongoing search
for a serial killer.

01:03:59.484 --> 01:04:02.078
Chicago Police Department has
released part of a tape...

01:04:02.278 --> 01:04:05.176
...sent to them by
the "Numbers Killer".

01:04:05.976 --> 01:04:08.671
"It would appear
I underestimated you.

01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:11.869
Sometimes I'm too clever
for my own good.

01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:13.868
It won't happen again".

01:04:14.068 --> 01:04:16.365
Anyone who recognizes
this voice...

01:04:16.665 --> 01:04:19.459
...is asked to contact the
Homicide Division...

01:04:19.759 --> 01:04:21.657
...of the Chicago Police
Department.

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:24.555
In other news tonight,
Chicago City officials have released...

01:04:24.855 --> 01:04:28.452
...last year's crime statistics...

01:04:40.638 --> 01:04:41.739
What's up?

01:04:42.037 --> 01:04:43.734
A woman just called
from the Beaumont Hotel...

01:04:44.034 --> 01:04:46.033
Said she recognizes the
voice in the tape.

01:04:46.233 --> 01:04:48.629
I'm gonna want to take
a couple of bodies with me.

01:04:49.028 --> 01:04:51.976
Take whoever you need.

01:04:52.011 --> 01:04:54.925
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:56.023
Scholfield.

01:04:59.621 --> 01:05:00.720
Prudhomme.

01:05:02.418 --> 01:05:04.913
He said whoever I needed.

01:05:24.792 --> 01:05:27.390
- I'm looking for Dolores Koontz.
- What did she do?

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:31.487
Chief... This ain't
an interview, buddy.

01:05:32.485 --> 01:05:34.181
4-D.

01:05:42.075 --> 01:05:43.972
Nice smell in here.

01:05:44.372 --> 01:05:46.369
It's like a goddamn latrine.

01:05:58.757 --> 01:06:01.057
- Miss Koontz?
- Yeah.

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:03.655
I'm Detective Rousch.
You called us?

01:06:04.054 --> 01:06:05.650
Yeah. I sure did.

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:09.646
While I was watching the news
this morning, I heard the tape.

01:06:09.846 --> 01:06:14.043
As soon as I heard it I thought
to myself, that's... Mr. Breslauer.

01:06:14.542 --> 01:06:16.340
You know his first name?

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.338
First name? No.

01:06:18.638 --> 01:06:21.034
I just always called
him Mr. Breslauer.

01:06:21.534 --> 01:06:23.231
He seems like a
very nice guy.

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:28.427
But I bet a lot of those serial
killers are like that, huh?

01:06:28.727 --> 01:06:29.926
You sure it was his voice?

01:06:30.125 --> 01:06:32.923
Yeah, enough to call.

01:06:33.123 --> 01:06:34.920
Where can we find him?

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.816
Down the hall. 4-J.

01:06:38.714 --> 01:06:40.613
If it is him, do I like
get anything?

01:06:40.813 --> 01:06:43.111
Appreciation from the people
of Chicago.

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:07.584
Mr. Breslauer, it's the police.
Would you open the door, please?

01:07:18.476 --> 01:07:22.570
Mr. Breslauer, we'd like to talk to
you. Please, can we come in?

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:44.447
We're here because someone thinks
you might have sent us a tape.

01:07:46.047 --> 01:07:47.644
A tape, huh?

01:07:48.242 --> 01:07:51.141
Mr. Breslauer, I'm gonna
read you a couple of sentences...

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.235
I'd appreciate if you repeat 'em
back to me.

01:07:54.934 --> 01:07:57.733
It would appear I
underestimated you.

01:07:57.932 --> 01:08:00.531
Sometimes I'm too clever
for my own good.

01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:04.328
It would appear I
underestimated you.

01:08:04.528 --> 01:08:08.322
Sometimes I'm too clever
for my own good.

01:08:10.421 --> 01:08:12.717
It won't happen again.

01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:15.915
You must admit there's a strange
irony to last night's events.

01:08:16.214 --> 01:08:19.511
But in the end, I got
what I wanted.

01:08:20.211 --> 01:08:25.303
John would have been better but
Andrew was an apostle also.

01:08:27.701 --> 01:08:29.501
Should I do the rest?

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:34.395
- He's not the guy.
- What? Did you hear his voice?

01:08:34.595 --> 01:08:36.194
He made the tape...

01:08:36.495 --> 01:08:39.589
...but he's not the guy
we're looking for.

01:08:45.183 --> 01:08:46.582
He is blind.

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:52.277
Mr. Breslauer,
you made the tape?

01:08:53.776 --> 01:08:55.572
- Yes.
- Why?

01:08:56.569 --> 01:08:59.768
- Someone paid me 50 dollars.
- Who? Do you know him?

01:09:00.568 --> 01:09:02.367
Some guy I met
in the park.

01:09:02.666 --> 01:09:04.163
Said he was working on
some kind of movie...

01:09:04.264 --> 01:09:06.464
and he was looking
for interesting voices.

01:09:06.663 --> 01:09:07.962
I knew that was a load
of bullshit...

01:09:08.162 --> 01:09:12.356
But 50 bucks is 50 bucks.

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:17.151
Thanks.

01:09:23.045 --> 01:09:26.240
He's smart. He talks to us
without using his voice.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:28.438
The guy who made the tape
can't identify him.

01:09:28.638 --> 01:09:31.336
I'm getting the feeling we're
never gonna catch this guy.

01:09:31.536 --> 01:09:34.832
They just found number 5.

01:10:30.174 --> 01:10:31.173
- Hey, John?
- Yeah.

01:10:31.373 --> 01:10:33.771
You got change for a dollar?

01:10:46.456 --> 01:10:47.755
Come with me.

01:10:49.056 --> 01:10:50.455
What are we looking for?

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:57.046
Peter Balcour had five
quarters in his pocket.

01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:00.641
So did Leesan.
What about the others?

01:11:05.738 --> 01:11:08.936
- James Ordway too.
- John Ordway also.

01:11:09.436 --> 01:11:14.530
So did Wells. Five victims,
all with five quarters in their pockets.

01:11:14.829 --> 01:11:17.026
No way that's a coincidence.

01:11:19.323 --> 01:11:20.423
Wait.

01:11:20.723 --> 01:11:24.020
To finish what he's doing
he needs six bodies.

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:28.614
Six bodies with five quarters
each is thirty quarters.

01:11:30.911 --> 01:11:33.208
Thirty pieces of silver!

01:11:33.708 --> 01:11:34.807
He thinks he's Judas?

01:11:35.007 --> 01:11:39.603
No. He's letting us know
why he's doing it.

01:11:40.902 --> 01:11:42.997
- He's atoning.
- John?

01:11:44.896 --> 01:11:47.094
- Take a look at this.
- What is it?

01:11:47.294 --> 01:11:49.091
Homicide report from Tennessee.

01:11:49.291 --> 01:11:51.790
Two and a half years ago, police
in Clarksdale found a 33 year old man...

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:55.784
...with his head cut off.
Victim's name was Philip Weir.

01:11:56.084 --> 01:11:57.584
- He was an apostle.
- Yeah.

01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.979
How did you get this?

01:12:00.079 --> 01:12:02.776
- FBI computer spilled it out.
- Just now?

01:12:03.178 --> 01:12:04.342
What do you mean just now?

01:12:04.377 --> 01:12:05.776
We called over Quantico
about three days ago.

01:12:05.975 --> 01:12:08.374
But I asked Wingate
three weeks ago!

01:12:15.466 --> 01:12:18.362
I'm detective Prudhomme.
I wanna see agent Wingate.

01:12:18.562 --> 01:12:19.527
Agent Wingate is in
a meeting right now.

01:12:19.562 --> 01:12:22.859
I don't care what he's doing.
I wanna see him now!

01:12:25.356 --> 01:12:27.953
I think you better
get out here.

01:12:28.753 --> 01:12:29.850
Have a seat, please.

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:33.345
No, thank you.
I don't wanna sit down.

01:12:33.545 --> 01:12:35.444
I wanna see Wingate.

01:12:38.042 --> 01:12:39.540
Is there a problem here?

01:12:41.139 --> 01:12:42.437
What the fuck?

01:12:42.837 --> 01:12:44.533
Yes, there is a problem!

01:12:44.733 --> 01:12:46.232
I wanna see agent Wingate!

01:12:46.432 --> 01:12:48.230
I'm agent Wingate.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.912
Didn't anybody check his I.D.?

01:13:06.112 --> 01:13:07.511
Desk sergeant said
he saw it.

01:13:07.611 --> 01:13:08.774
It looked good to him.

01:13:08.809 --> 01:13:11.309
Somebody this clever wouldn't
have any problem getting a card.

01:13:11.607 --> 01:13:14.606
A badge you can find anywhere.

01:13:14.804 --> 01:13:16.802
What about the office
number he gave?

01:13:17.102 --> 01:13:20.098
It was a message centre,
rented by mail with a money order.

01:13:20.298 --> 01:13:22.995
- Cell phone number?
- Cloned.

01:13:23.395 --> 01:13:27.392
If we get a print and it's
on file, we'll I.D. him.

01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:33.783
We still have one thing
on our side.

01:13:34.083 --> 01:13:37.081
He doesn't know we know.

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.878
- Wingate.
- Prudhomme.

01:13:40.178 --> 01:13:41.776
- How's it going?
- Good.

01:13:42.076 --> 01:13:45.272
We may have found a few things
that might put us a little closer.

01:13:45.571 --> 01:13:46.969
What things?

01:13:47.268 --> 01:13:50.465
I'd like to run them by
you here sometime.

01:13:50.765 --> 01:13:55.560
- I'm kind of busy today...
- It would only take about half hour.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:14:00.456
I'll meet you in two hours
over that pizza place.

01:14:00.756 --> 01:14:04.650
- Great, I appreciate it.
- No problem.

01:14:05.349 --> 01:14:06.648
We got him.

01:14:19.936 --> 01:14:22.133
- Are you guys ready?
- Ten-Four.

01:14:28.727 --> 01:14:31.226
- Moltz?
- Roger.

01:14:48.804 --> 01:14:49.705
He's here.

01:14:54.799 --> 01:14:57.996
He's crossing the street.
Dark blue suit.

01:14:58.294 --> 01:14:59.394
Got him.

01:15:06.885 --> 01:15:08.584
- Take him!
- Freeze!

01:15:08.984 --> 01:15:11.183
Put your hands over
your head. Now!

01:15:11.282 --> 01:15:13.380
Put your hands on top
of your head!

01:15:14.081 --> 01:15:17.477
Get down! Down!

01:15:19.773 --> 01:15:21.972
Get on your fucking
knees, now!

01:15:22.072 --> 01:15:23.769
Get on your knees. Now!

01:15:38.453 --> 01:15:39.952
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:15:40.152 --> 01:15:43.550
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

01:15:43.749 --> 01:15:45.048
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:15:45.247 --> 01:15:48.045
If you can't afford one
it will be too fucking bad.

01:15:48.345 --> 01:15:51.440
Let's get this prick
into the fucking car.

01:15:57.935 --> 01:16:03.029
It's just a matter of time until
your prints tell us who you are.

01:16:03.528 --> 01:16:05.724
Only if I have a
criminal record in Illinois...

01:16:05.924 --> 01:16:07.622
...which I do not.

01:16:08.822 --> 01:16:10.920
I'd like to know
why I'm here.

01:16:11.919 --> 01:16:14.117
Because you murdered five people.

01:16:14.516 --> 01:16:15.981
Really?

01:16:16.016 --> 01:16:20.010
What, may I ask, is the evidence you're
using to support this claim?

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:23.408
Do you have any prints?
Any trace evidence? Physical evidence?

01:16:23.708 --> 01:16:26.203
Witnesses? Motive?
Anything?

01:16:26.503 --> 01:16:30.500
One thing that connects
me to these crimes?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.694
You don't have to answer.
I already know. I've seen the files.

01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:41.788
You think you're really
clever, don't you?

01:16:43.286 --> 01:16:46.284
Let's talk about the
Clarksdale murder.

01:16:47.482 --> 01:16:49.280
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.176
Oh yes, you do.
You were there.

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:54.673
What was it, a practice round?

01:16:56.671 --> 01:17:00.069
Do you really think you're
doing God's work?

01:17:00.269 --> 01:17:04.765
If God were to call
upon someone...

01:17:05.364 --> 01:17:08.958
Do you really think he'd choose a
pathetic little worm like you?

01:17:10.157 --> 01:17:13.955
Why, Detective Prudhomme, I do believe
you're trying to provoke me.

01:17:16.252 --> 01:17:19.251
- Listen to me.
- No! You listen to me.

01:17:19.451 --> 01:17:22.746
I'm only talking with you because it gives me
something to do before my attorney arrives.

01:17:23.046 --> 01:17:25.144
The truth is, I'll be out
of here in 48 hours.

01:17:25.344 --> 01:17:26.407
You know it
and I know it.

01:17:26.442 --> 01:17:28.939
Of course, you and your
partner will follow me...

01:17:29.139 --> 01:17:32.136
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot!
Your partner can't walk anymore...

01:17:32.436 --> 01:17:34.833
...since his leg got blown off?
- Shut up!

01:17:35.034 --> 01:17:37.230
I'd imagine you carry a tremendous
amount of guilt for that.

01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:38.527
Shut your mouth!

01:17:38.627 --> 01:17:40.626
He trusted you but when he
ran towards you for safety...

01:17:40.925 --> 01:17:44.023
Prudhomme, outside.
Now!

01:17:50.616 --> 01:17:54.112
I enjoyed our little
chat, detective. I truly did.

01:18:02.603 --> 01:18:04.600
He's a cocky little prick,
isn't he?

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.701
He knows we have nothing.

01:18:06.901 --> 01:18:08.595
He also knows the law.

01:18:09.194 --> 01:18:13.593
If we don't get something in 48 hours,
we got to cut him loose.

01:18:34.472 --> 01:18:37.369
I'm sorry about last week.

01:18:38.266 --> 01:18:40.064
It wasn't your fault.

01:18:40.163 --> 01:18:41.562
You know that.

01:18:44.959 --> 01:18:46.458
It's OK.

01:18:47.058 --> 01:18:49.556
They say you got him.
Who is he?

01:18:50.655 --> 01:18:55.048
We don't know. We've plastered
his face all over the news.

01:18:55.348 --> 01:18:58.444
Hundreds of people are calling.

01:18:58.644 --> 01:19:01.543
We feed the names
into the computer and...

01:19:01.843 --> 01:19:03.440
...wait for a print match.

01:19:05.338 --> 01:19:08.734
- But it's him?
- It's him.

01:19:09.531 --> 01:19:12.629
You can't let this
fucker walk, John.

01:19:12.929 --> 01:19:15.128
I won't.

01:19:16.527 --> 01:19:17.825
I won't.

01:19:19.926 --> 01:19:21.324
Not guilty.

01:19:22.523 --> 01:19:23.422
Bail?

01:19:23.522 --> 01:19:26.718
Your honour, the State is
requesting that bail be denied.

01:19:27.017 --> 01:19:28.515
On what grounds?

01:19:28.714 --> 01:19:31.211
We do not know the
defendant's true identity...

01:19:31.611 --> 01:19:35.508
...therefore we cannot determine
his ties to the community.

01:19:35.808 --> 01:19:38.406
We feel that the risk of
flight is great.

01:19:38.605 --> 01:19:41.001
The fact that the police
cannot prove nor disprove...

01:19:41.201 --> 01:19:44.198
...my client's identity is not
grounds to deny bail.

01:19:44.597 --> 01:19:47.595
The truth is Mr. Wingate
has been held for nearly two days...

01:19:47.795 --> 01:19:49.492
...on a probable cause
on another matter.

01:19:49.592 --> 01:19:51.591
Is this true, Mr. Galloway?

01:19:52.291 --> 01:19:55.885
Yes, your honour. He is
considered a prime suspect...

01:19:56.084 --> 01:19:58.682
...in regards to the recent
spree of murders.

01:19:59.082 --> 01:20:00.879
I see no murder
charges before me.

01:20:00.979 --> 01:20:04.276
The only charge I see is
impersonating a federal officer.

01:20:05.674 --> 01:20:07.972
Bail is set at twenty
thousand dollars.

01:20:08.172 --> 01:20:11.367
We'll have a ten minute recess.
Gentleman, would you approach the bench, please?

01:20:18.263 --> 01:20:21.261
Mr. Galloway, what exactly do you
think you're doing out there?

01:20:21.561 --> 01:20:23.259
Just trying to stop a murderer
from going free.

01:20:23.458 --> 01:20:24.957
There are procedures for that.

01:20:25.156 --> 01:20:27.253
As a district attorney, I should not
have to tell you this.

01:20:27.453 --> 01:20:29.052
I will not have this
courtroom used...

01:20:29.252 --> 01:20:31.547
...for your personal
agenda, Mr. Galloway.

01:20:31.747 --> 01:20:33.446
Judge, my client is
ready to post bail.

01:20:33.646 --> 01:20:35.346
I'd like to request his
immediate release.

01:20:35.446 --> 01:20:38.143
I still have six hours
left to hold him.

01:20:38.442 --> 01:20:39.842
And I intend to use them.

01:20:39.942 --> 01:20:41.938
Six hours, Mr. Galloway.

01:20:42.138 --> 01:20:45.434
You either file murder charges
or you release him.

01:20:58.819 --> 01:21:01.417
Janice, I sent photos of a man!

01:21:02.815 --> 01:21:06.112
Sex change operation.
OK, thank you very much.

01:21:09.808 --> 01:21:12.005
When was the last
time you saw him?

01:21:12.305 --> 01:21:15.401
40 years ago!
I'll check on it. Thanks.

01:21:16.602 --> 01:21:18.399
- The killings in Tennessee?
- Ask him how far he is from Clarksdale.

01:21:21.896 --> 01:21:24.695
Ma'am, how far are you
from Clarksdale?

01:21:24.894 --> 01:21:26.792
- 20 miles.
- Ma'am I need you to...

01:21:27.490 --> 01:21:30.088
Gerald Demus.
Rush it through...

01:21:30.188 --> 01:21:32.884
FBI, Tennessee Police
and the DMV.

01:21:39.678 --> 01:21:42.773
No, thank you.
I'll be going out for lunch today.

01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:47.968
I just got off the phone
with the Sheriff's Department.

01:21:48.068 --> 01:21:51.866
They have no record of
a Gerald Demus.

01:21:52.166 --> 01:21:53.764
You try the neighbouring towns?

01:21:53.864 --> 01:21:55.363
We're on it now.

01:21:58.757 --> 01:22:00.755
I'm here for Greg Wingate.

01:22:05.151 --> 01:22:06.950
- Yeah?
- Elkins's here to pick up Wingate.

01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:09.546
- What? Stall him!
- How?

01:22:09.846 --> 01:22:11.645
I don't know!
Think of something.

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:18.337
We're having trouble
finding the paperwork.

01:22:22.933 --> 01:22:25.532
- City Court.
- Judge Seers, please.

01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:30.125
Prudhomme, what the
hell do you think you're doing?

01:22:30.425 --> 01:22:32.524
Wingate was supposed to
be released 15 minutes ago.

01:22:32.823 --> 01:22:34.186
Re-cause him.

01:22:34.221 --> 01:22:36.119
You got something you
can give right now?

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:38.917
- No.
- Then kick him loose.

01:22:39.516 --> 01:22:41.713
I need a little more time.

01:22:41.913 --> 01:22:44.111
We think we know who he is.
And if he is...

01:22:44.210 --> 01:22:47.906
He lived 20 miles from
an identical murder 2 years ago!

01:22:48.205 --> 01:22:49.904
We don't have any
more time.

01:22:50.104 --> 01:22:52.102
I just got a
call from Judge Seers.

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:55.300
She issued a writ
for his immediate release.

01:22:55.698 --> 01:22:57.197
Thanks a lot.

01:22:59.292 --> 01:23:00.792
You're out of here.

01:23:03.588 --> 01:23:06.088
I want you on him
the minute he walks out the door.

01:23:06.188 --> 01:23:08.885
If he takes a shit, I wanna know
how many times he wipes his ass.

01:23:11.082 --> 01:23:13.082
- Sign here.
- Here?

01:23:16.775 --> 01:23:18.074
Thanks.

01:23:18.473 --> 01:23:21.272
- Thanks. You too.
- My pleasure.

01:23:31.061 --> 01:23:31.962
Taxi.

01:23:47.743 --> 01:23:49.541
He is in Sixth and Blanche.

01:23:55.436 --> 01:23:57.435
He is headed for the
train station.

01:23:57.535 --> 01:23:58.434
Go.

01:24:06.823 --> 01:24:09.222
Sheriff in Woodsville, Tennessee
says he arrested...

01:24:09.422 --> 01:24:12.817
...Gerald Demus 5 years ago
for attacking the town minister.

01:24:13.116 --> 01:24:15.517
- Prints are on their way over.
- Get that out.

01:24:50.378 --> 01:24:52.576
- You think he's leaving?
- No.

01:24:52.776 --> 01:24:54.675
He's not finished yet.

01:25:57.210 --> 01:26:00.507
Cap, prints are in.
Lab's working on it now.

01:26:47.058 --> 01:26:49.058
Can you do this faster?

01:27:02.443 --> 01:27:06.837
Yes. We got a match.
Take him.

01:27:23.418 --> 01:27:26.316
Demus? This is the police.

01:27:26.416 --> 01:27:29.314
Stand up and
open the door slowly.

01:27:29.513 --> 01:27:31.413
Do it now!

01:27:40.501 --> 01:27:42.599
Shit!
Fuck!

01:27:42.699 --> 01:27:47.096
What? Everyone move in.
I want this place closed down now!

01:27:49.695 --> 01:27:51.989
- Seal the door.
- Got it.

01:27:52.289 --> 01:27:55.886
Hold it, please. No one must
leave. This is a police emergency.

01:28:15.467 --> 01:28:17.362
Shit!

01:28:47.733 --> 01:28:50.329
Hey! Sorry.

01:28:55.823 --> 01:29:01.817
Hey! Hey you!
Hey you, stop!

01:29:06.712 --> 01:29:09.207
Get down! Get down!

01:29:12.106 --> 01:29:13.405
Stay down!

01:29:23.494 --> 01:29:25.491
Get out of my way!

01:29:25.691 --> 01:29:27.189
Freeze!

01:29:30.987 --> 01:29:32.786
Demus!

01:29:35.484 --> 01:29:37.382
Motherfucker!

01:29:41.077 --> 01:29:42.776
Freeze!

01:29:43.474 --> 01:29:45.871
Motherfucker!
Get out of the way!

01:30:09.545 --> 01:30:12.742
I lost him.
Shit!

01:30:19.437 --> 01:30:24.532
5 years ago, Demus attacks
the local minister in Woodsville.

01:30:24.930 --> 01:30:27.327
The minister refuses to
press charges...

01:30:27.427 --> 01:30:29.025
...so they kick him loose.

01:30:29.626 --> 01:30:31.325
But they still arrested him.

01:30:31.525 --> 01:30:33.522
Why weren't his prints
in the system?

01:30:33.622 --> 01:30:35.521
Woodsville is a small department.

01:30:35.621 --> 01:30:39.517
They only came online with
the Tennessee database 3 years ago.

01:30:39.716 --> 01:30:42.813
Even then, they only entered
recent arrests into the system.

01:30:43.012 --> 01:30:45.210
Hundreds of millions
of dollars in computers...

01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:47.507
...and we I.D. the guy
because some old lady...

01:30:47.607 --> 01:30:50.405
...in Willingston, Tennessee,
is watching on TV?

01:30:50.505 --> 01:30:51.404
Incredible!

01:30:51.704 --> 01:30:54.601
Two and a half years later,
Demus kills Phillip Weir.

01:30:54.901 --> 01:30:56.063
Why'd he stop?

01:30:56.098 --> 01:31:00.294
Because 2 weeks after the murder
he was picked up in Tulsa.

01:31:00.494 --> 01:31:03.291
Wandering the streets,
talking to the pigeons.

01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:08.087
He spent the next 2 years
in the state mental hospital.

01:31:08.286 --> 01:31:11.681
They just released him
3 months ago.

01:31:12.179 --> 01:31:15.078
Why didn't he stay in Tulsa?

01:32:24.306 --> 01:32:25.904
Scholfield!

01:32:26.804 --> 01:32:28.401
Welcome.

01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:31.597
Thomas Heckert, 33.

01:32:31.697 --> 01:32:35.295
That's the boyfriend, works the
graveyard in the Memorial Medical Centre.

01:32:35.595 --> 01:32:37.792
Found him this morning
when he came in from work.

01:32:38.393 --> 01:32:41.590
- How long has he been dead?
- A few hours.

01:32:41.690 --> 01:32:46.785
He took the torso.
Left the legs, the arms and the head.

01:32:48.181 --> 01:32:49.880
You think this is
the end of it?

01:32:53.278 --> 01:32:54.676
I hope so.

01:32:55.176 --> 01:32:57.574
This didn't have to happen.

01:32:57.674 --> 01:33:00.568
All you had to do was
hold Demus a little longer.

01:33:00.668 --> 01:33:02.066
Don't lay this at my door!

01:33:02.166 --> 01:33:04.565
This man would still be alive
if your guys didn't lose him!

01:33:04.665 --> 01:33:07.162
- Yeah, right.
- Fuck off!

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:11.259
You've seen this?

01:33:11.559 --> 01:33:14.653
They're running a pictorial
of the crime scenes.

01:33:15.152 --> 01:33:18.249
Jesus! Next they'll
be giving tours.

01:33:24.842 --> 01:33:26.741
This isn't right.

01:33:26.941 --> 01:33:29.637
- What isn't right?
- This photo.

01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:34.532
When we sealed the crime scene,
all the windows and shutters were closed.

01:33:34.832 --> 01:33:37.431
Look at the upstairs window.
It's open.

01:33:37.730 --> 01:33:40.029
Where's the best place to hide?

01:33:40.329 --> 01:33:42.327
Somewhere we've already looked.

01:33:56.211 --> 01:33:58.411
Go upstairs.

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:09.498
Go, go! Move.
Move! Go!

01:34:28.677 --> 01:34:29.876
Clear!

01:34:42.864 --> 01:34:46.058
Sweet mother of God!

01:34:46.158 --> 01:34:47.757
Prudhomme?

01:34:48.157 --> 01:34:50.256
You better get in here.

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:43.401
Shit!

01:35:55.687 --> 01:35:59.284
Prudhomme!
Check this out upstairs!

01:36:18.561 --> 01:36:22.257
Behold the glory of God!

01:36:22.756 --> 01:36:25.456
Sinners, take heed!

01:36:25.656 --> 01:36:30.050
Soon, the hand of judgment
shall be upon ye.

01:36:32.849 --> 01:36:35.244
Motherfucker!

01:37:20.397 --> 01:37:23.394
Alright. We leave a team here
in case he comes back.

01:37:23.494 --> 01:37:25.691
He'll be back.

01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:28.889
But when he does,
someone else will be dead.

01:37:28.988 --> 01:37:31.386
Rib spreaders.
Used to open the chest.

01:37:31.585 --> 01:37:33.884
Don't even tell me that.

01:37:34.084 --> 01:37:37.078
Yes. He's going after a heart.

01:37:37.278 --> 01:37:39.376
Tomorrow is Easter.

01:37:39.678 --> 01:37:41.377
We need to search every hospital.

01:37:41.677 --> 01:37:46.972
We're looking for a woman who gives
birth to a son after midnight.

01:37:47.272 --> 01:37:50.366
- You know how many hospitals...
- Her name will be Mary.

01:37:57.759 --> 01:38:00.158
I've got a Mary at St. Paul.
She's in labour now.

01:38:00.258 --> 01:38:01.656
Girl or boy?

01:38:01.756 --> 01:38:04.553
I don't know. The parents didn't
want to know the results of the ultrasound.

01:38:04.653 --> 01:38:07.050
You and Scholfield go
to see that one.

01:38:13.343 --> 01:38:14.642
Thanks.

01:38:14.742 --> 01:38:16.005
- Got it!
- What?

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:18.539
Oak Park Memorial
has a Mary Dominguez.

01:38:18.739 --> 01:38:21.133
- She just gave birth to a boy.
- Let's go!

01:38:39.214 --> 01:38:40.813
God!

01:39:37.356 --> 01:39:38.653
Hold it! C'mon!

01:39:52.841 --> 01:39:55.337
- You're OK?
- Shit! Yeah. Go, go!

01:39:55.537 --> 01:39:58.033
- Call for backup!
- Go, go, go!

01:40:46.084 --> 01:40:50.281
It's over.
Give me the baby.

01:40:56.273 --> 01:40:57.672
No! No!

01:40:58.772 --> 01:41:01.167
It's kind of an instinct
predicament, isn't it?

01:41:01.867 --> 01:41:03.266
Put down the gun.

01:41:04.365 --> 01:41:05.565
Put it down!

01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:09.261
OK.

01:41:12.555 --> 01:41:17.151
I would imagine this is a painful situation
for you, with already losing one child.

01:41:18.150 --> 01:41:21.648
It's over! We've been inside
the house and took the body.

01:41:22.247 --> 01:41:24.745
Sacrilege! Sacrilege!

01:41:25.343 --> 01:41:28.739
You're nothing now.
Nothing but another lunatic.

01:41:29.038 --> 01:41:32.535
One year from now, no one
will even remember you name.

01:41:32.935 --> 01:41:35.733
- If I drop this child, they will.
- No!

01:41:36.630 --> 01:41:39.229
He is my last offering.

01:41:39.330 --> 01:41:41.026
No! No!

01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:49.219
It's time for us to die.

01:41:49.418 --> 01:41:50.518
Motherfucker!

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:28.375
- There you are, Mr. Prudhomme.
- Thank you.

01:42:28.576 --> 01:42:30.174
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

01:42:34.971 --> 01:42:39.166
John, the baby's parents
would like to thank you.

01:42:41.665 --> 01:42:44.859
- Thank you for the life of my son.
- I'm glad he's alright.

01:42:50.055 --> 01:42:53.453
Please, take this.

01:42:57.448 --> 01:42:58.846
Thank you.

01:43:05.139 --> 01:43:06.939
I spoke to the doc.

01:43:07.338 --> 01:43:09.536
You're gonna be out of
the field for at least 3 months.

01:43:09.736 --> 01:43:13.231
Its not important.
I need some time.

01:43:13.630 --> 01:43:17.325
I need to pick up some
of the pieces in my life.

01:43:19.624 --> 01:43:22.021
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:43:34.507 --> 01:43:38.204
Hey man, come on in.
Just in time for a test drive.

01:43:38.704 --> 01:43:42.100
- You're looking good, Andy.
- No, man. I look terrible.

01:43:43.701 --> 01:43:47.195
I met a guy who ran the Boston
marathon with one of these things.

01:43:47.592 --> 01:43:48.894
When are you
coming back to work?

01:43:49.093 --> 01:43:52.990
I'm coming back. Don't get
me wrong, John. I'm comin' back.

01:43:53.290 --> 01:43:56.688
I'm comin' back but not sit
on one of those damn desks, either.

01:43:56.888 --> 01:43:59.282
Guys ski with these things,
you know?

01:44:00.581 --> 01:44:01.382
Fuck.

01:44:01.482 --> 01:44:03.579
- Let me help.
- I'm OK, John.

01:44:04.378 --> 01:44:06.775
Listen, seriously...

01:44:07.575 --> 01:44:11.871
If this is gonna work for real,
you gotta give me a chance, alright?

01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:13.569
You gotta give me
a chance to come back.

01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:16.564
I'll be good as new.
But you gotta give me a chance.

01:44:17.863 --> 01:44:21.659
You may have to pick up
a fair share of the legwork.

01:44:22.159 --> 01:44:23.558
But I will be back.

01:44:24.305 --> 01:44:30.674
