WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:04.003
- Hey, charlie.
- Charlie.

00:04.005 --> 00:06.672
Hey, sean.
Glad you're back
at group.

00:06.674 --> 00:07.740
- Thank you.
-  <i>( door shuts )</i>

00:07.742 --> 00:10.142
You guys just did
a bro hug.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.543
That's like
the male version of,

00:11.545 --> 00:13.746
"oh, my god,
I love your shoes."

00:13.748 --> 00:16.348
Sean, the group
will be here any minute
if you wanna head in.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.584
- I'm gonna miss you, babe.
- Oh.

00:18.586 --> 00:22.187
- I'm gonna
miss you, too, babe.
- Ah, young love.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.690
It's so much cuter
than what's going on
right here.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.494
Sean,
do you wanna
grab this?

00:28.496 --> 00:29.762
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll follow you
with the coffee.

00:29.764 --> 00:31.397
- All right.
- ( jen sighs )

00:31.399 --> 00:34.133
- See you later, babe.
- Keep walking, babe.

00:35.802 --> 00:38.370
I finally
get to use
the shower

00:38.372 --> 00:40.739
And ed has
once again
helped himself

00:40.741 --> 00:43.575
To my milk and honey soap
with oatmeal and shea butter.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.711
Can you blame him?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.713
Sounds delicious.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.149
What makes you think
I'm using your soap?

00:50.151 --> 00:51.750
Your hairs
are all over it.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.318
They can't be ed hairs.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.321
He doesn't have any--
oh, my god!

00:56.323 --> 00:58.290
I'm at the age where
they're jumping ship.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.426
I can't stop 'em.

01:00.428 --> 01:04.797
Any conversation in therapy
can lead to something good?

01:04.799 --> 01:07.232
Well, they were wrong.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.801
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

01:08.803 --> 01:10.669
Uh, why is the old man

01:10.671 --> 01:12.704
Living with the gay man?

01:14.074 --> 01:16.608
It's a long story,
but the gay man

01:16.610 --> 01:18.811
Tricked the old man
into thinking he won
the lottery.

01:20.213 --> 01:21.747
I told patrick

01:21.749 --> 01:25.217
If ed thought he was rich,
he'd go crazy and leave
his wife.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.852
You said nothing.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.720
You said
it would be funny.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.589
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.694
Aren't you guys
supposed to be helping
each other not be angry?

01:35.696 --> 01:37.563
Yeah, what's wrong
with you people?

01:37.565 --> 01:40.232
You're such idiots.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.134
See you all next week.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.143
Did you see what I saw?

01:51.145 --> 01:53.645
Yeah. I noticed it
all throughout session.

01:53.647 --> 01:57.416
A man ed's age
should wear socks
with his shoes.

01:57.418 --> 02:00.452
Yeah, that could destroy
a relationship, too.

02:01.654 --> 02:03.722
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

02:06.192 --> 02:08.393
It's been the happiest
11 years of my life

02:08.395 --> 02:10.896
And I can't imagine
not being married to her.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.732
Oh, thanks.
Me, too.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.567
Well, thank you both
very much for coming in.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.903
- Real pleasure.
- Thanks.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.705
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye-bye.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.607
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.244
It is so nice
to see a couple
that happy.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.513
They'll be divorced
in six months.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.748
What?
How do you know?

02:29.750 --> 02:32.184
I just know.
I felt it the second
I saw them.

02:32.186 --> 02:35.254
That's so unlike you,
you know, to feel something.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.823
It's not a feeling,
it's science.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.424
It's like that
gladwell book "blink."

02:39.426 --> 02:42.394
Our subconscious makes
a thousand calculations

02:42.396 --> 02:44.796
And decides things
before we're even
aware of it.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.865
I knew they were doomed
the second they walked in.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.535
Come on.
You don't know what
you're talking about.

02:51.437 --> 02:54.907
Excuse me.
My lovely wife left
her $600 sunglasses here.

02:54.909 --> 02:56.742
<i>Third time this month</i>
<i>and next time,</i>

02:56.744 --> 02:58.343
I make the bitch
pay for them.

03:01.614 --> 03:03.248
"b-link."

03:05.251 --> 03:07.419
Oh, man.
( sighs )

03:07.421 --> 03:08.887
What is it?

03:08.889 --> 03:11.857
I think I "blinked" something
today in group.

03:11.859 --> 03:15.594
The guy jen's "blinking"
is blinking someone else.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.596
Here's the worst part...

03:17.598 --> 03:19.798
I think he's cheating on her
with lacey.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.600
You'd think it goes
without saying,

03:21.602 --> 03:23.902
But that's why
you don't have your
ex-wife's new boyfriend

03:23.904 --> 03:25.837
In your therapy group.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.940
Just once,
I'd like something
to actually

03:27.942 --> 03:30.509
"go without saying."

03:30.511 --> 03:32.511
That wouldn't be any fun,
but, of course,

03:32.513 --> 03:32.844
That goes without saying.

03:37.951 --> 03:41.420
- Ed, I bought you some socks.
- <i>( water running )</i>

03:41.422 --> 03:43.488
No more excuses.

03:44.791 --> 03:47.526
- Where are you?
- Ed: <i>In the shower.</i>

03:47.528 --> 03:49.328
( sighs )
of course.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.330
( cell phone rings )

03:52.765 --> 03:54.733
Nolan,
you don't need
to keep checking in.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.603
I already told you,
ed and I are never going
to have a party

03:57.605 --> 03:59.605
And forget to invite you.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.940
No, that's not what
I'm calling about this time.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.542
I've been robbed!

04:03.544 --> 04:05.010
Are you serious?
Are you okay?

04:05.012 --> 04:07.479
Yeah, I guess.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.281
They took
just about everything.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.916
I'm pretty shaken up.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.251
Are you hurt?

04:12.253 --> 04:14.019
A little.

04:14.021 --> 04:17.422
They kept saying
my stuff was crap.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.657
Okay, we'll be right over.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.260
- Okay, thanks.
- Bye.

04:21.262 --> 04:24.363
Ed, hurry up.
Nolan's been robbed
and we have to get over there.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.699
- <i>I'm almost done.</i>
<i>- Seriously, what</i>
<i>are you doing?</i>

04:27.701 --> 04:29.568
<i>I'm washing your soap.</i>

04:29.570 --> 04:31.903
<i>It's a damn oxymoron.</i>

04:34.507 --> 04:37.409
This is a pretty racy costume
for a high school musical.

04:37.411 --> 04:41.046
We have to stay
authentic to the times
and the story, mom.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.614
Yeah, right.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.750
Admit it,
you just like
looking hot.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.618
I get it.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.487
I got sent home
by the principal

04:48.489 --> 04:50.789
For wearing a blouse
that was too revealing.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.392
Really?
What grade were you in?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.761
All of 'em.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.629
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

05:02.035 --> 05:04.536
All right, freeze.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.705
What is she doing wearing
your old wedding dress?

05:06.707 --> 05:09.675
We're doing "chicago"
and I'm going to be
a chorus girl.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.010
- ( exhales sharply )
- mom said it was okay.

05:14.380 --> 05:17.683
- I can't believe this.
- What, that our little girl's
growing up?

05:17.685 --> 05:19.785
No, that I have to go
to a musical.

05:19.787 --> 05:23.055
- Jen, let me
ask you something.
- Hmm.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.956
How did you know
I was cheating?

05:24.958 --> 05:28.827
I walked in on you
in that hotel room
in atlanta.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.331
And you said she was
a physical therapist,
but I didn't buy it.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.333
Because you had
a gut feeling, right?

05:34.335 --> 05:36.835
Because you had
your penis inside her.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.505
Right. Again,
so sorry about all that.

05:41.741 --> 05:44.543
Well, jen, I've got
a gut feeling about sean.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.512
- He's cheating?
- I think so.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.882
Oh, my god.
What did you see?

05:50.884 --> 05:53.985
- Was he kissing someone?
- Well, no, no.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.620
Her shoulder kind of

05:55.622 --> 05:58.390
Brushed up
against his shoulder.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.758
And then what happened?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.927
That-- that was about it,

06:01.929 --> 06:04.029
But that--
that was enough.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.966
That lying, cheating
shoulder-brusher.

06:07.968 --> 06:11.103
- You're not taking me
seriously, are you?
- No, I am not.

06:11.105 --> 06:14.906
Charlie, you have had it out
for this guy from day one.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.842
Get out!

06:16.844 --> 06:18.910
I'm only telling you this
because I care about you.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.679
Get out!

06:20.681 --> 06:22.080
Jen, I know cheating.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.783
If it walks like a charlie
and talks like a charlie,

06:24.785 --> 06:26.785
It's screwing somebody--

06:28.055 --> 06:33.658
- Patrick: <i>It's us.</i>
<i>- Prove you're not the robbers.</i>

06:33.660 --> 06:35.727
Ed:
<i>You're an idiot.</i>

06:37.096 --> 06:38.964
Robbers wouldn't know that.

06:41.501 --> 06:44.469
- Thanks for coming, guys.
- Oh, my god.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.138
They really did
take everything.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.673
I'm so sorry, nolan.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.709
Did you write a list
for the police?

06:50.711 --> 06:52.778
Yeah, right here.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.149
Tv, playstation...

06:58.684 --> 06:59.951
Okay,
where's the rest?

06:59.953 --> 07:01.486
That was it.

07:01.488 --> 07:04.589
You're telling me
that's all they took?

07:04.591 --> 07:07.793
This is how you live?

07:07.795 --> 07:10.729
What about your furniture?
Where'd you sit?

07:10.731 --> 07:13.064
Oh, my god.
They took my milk crate, too.

07:14.700 --> 07:18.069
Well, at least
they didn't take the thing
I care about the most.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.539
Turtle.

07:21.474 --> 07:23.608
Turtle the parakeet?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.644
Turtle's great.
He keeps me company.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.679
Sometimes I feel
like he's the only one
who listens

07:27.681 --> 07:29.648
- Without interrupting--
- yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

07:29.650 --> 07:33.218
Look, what do you need
from us?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.686
I don't know.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.088
Can you just hang
for a while?

07:37.090 --> 07:39.524
I'm a little nervous
to be here alone.

07:39.526 --> 07:40.892
Sure.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.728
If they come back,
we'll be prepared.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.132
Wow.
Is that real?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.034
Sure, it's real.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.769
Feel how heavy that is.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.705
Ed, what the hell
are you thinking?!

07:53.707 --> 07:55.607
Did you have a gun

07:55.609 --> 07:57.709
In my apartment
this whole time?!

07:57.711 --> 08:00.512
No.
I had three guns.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.582
Look at me,
I'm in a john woo movie.
( mimics gunshots )

08:03.584 --> 08:05.750
Hey, give me that.

08:05.752 --> 08:09.921
Patrick, there is
nothing wrong with guns.

08:09.923 --> 08:13.558
If somebody breaks
into your home,

08:13.560 --> 08:15.927
What are you gonna do,
their hair?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.762
No.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.531
Bang!
Too late,
I shot ya.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.866
- No, I would--
- bang!

08:20.868 --> 08:24.503
I shot you again.
You're dead.
Stop moving.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.772
So without
any real evidence,

08:27.774 --> 08:30.742
You told jen
her boyfriend's cheating?

08:30.744 --> 08:31.810
I had the "blink" instinct.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.712
Oh, that's different.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.914
I read that book
and it's true.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.583
I can walk into a bar
and instantly spot

08:38.585 --> 08:40.051
Every single woman

08:40.053 --> 08:42.954
Who's not gonna
wanna sleep with me.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.891
So you mean
"every single woman"?

08:47.226 --> 08:49.561
- <i>( knocks on door )</i>
<i>- sean: Hey, charlie,</i>

08:49.563 --> 08:52.264
Why don't you come
open the door so I can
kick your ass?

08:52.266 --> 08:54.733
- You better get outta here.
I gotta deal with this guy.
- Are you sure?

08:54.735 --> 08:58.270
My "blink" instinct
tells me this guy wants
to kick your ass.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.739
Don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt me.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.874
He lives off jen
and jen lives off me.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.976
If he kills me,
he'll starve to death.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.012
- See ya.
- All right.

09:11.817 --> 09:13.084
Hi. What's going on?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.853
You lying son of a bitch.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.154
You told jen

09:16.156 --> 09:18.757
That I was cheating on her
and she kicked me out.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.126
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
She didn't believe me.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.828
So if she kicked you out,
that's from something she
found out on her own.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.097
She found a couple of calls
that I made to lacey.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.133
I knew it!
The shoulder bump.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.102
I was calling lacey

09:31.104 --> 09:32.737
Because she has
club connections

09:32.739 --> 09:34.773
And that's
my industry, dude.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.676
I'm busting my ass
to try and get a job.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.110
Spinning an excuse

09:39.112 --> 09:41.179
To cover your tracks
and look like a hero.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.014
Cheating technique
number one.

09:43.016 --> 09:46.952
Look, you are talking
to a former professional
cheater.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.787
Really,
what happened?

09:48.789 --> 09:51.790
It got in your way
of your new career as
a full-time douchebag?

09:51.792 --> 09:53.825
Accusing the accuser?

09:53.827 --> 09:55.160
You bore me, son.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.761
Oh, and by the way,

09:56.763 --> 09:58.730
Consoling
a newly divorced
friend...

09:58.732 --> 10:00.165
I invented that.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.734
The divorce rate in the '90s
was like a gift to me.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.203
All right.
That was a lie.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.771
Because I was on
a job interview.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.807
Why would you lie about
being on a job interview?

10:08.809 --> 10:10.842
Because it was
the 15th job interview

10:10.844 --> 10:12.611
I've been on
in the last month.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.146
And every time that I fail,
I have to see my girlfriend

10:15.148 --> 10:16.748
Pretend like
she's not disappointed,

10:16.750 --> 10:18.984
But I can see it
in her eyes.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.819
And then when you look
in the garbage

10:20.821 --> 10:22.821
And you see a cupcake
with "congratulations"

10:22.823 --> 10:24.923
Written on the top of it...

10:24.925 --> 10:26.658
You don't eat that cupcake.
You know why?

10:26.660 --> 10:28.126
Because it was touching

10:28.128 --> 10:30.895
An old q-tip
and a banana peel?

10:30.897 --> 10:33.064
Because you feel like dirt.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.900
And you feel like
you don't deserve a cupcake.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.802
Cheating technique
number two:

10:37.804 --> 10:40.639
( mimics crying )
the sob story.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.641
Nice try,
but it's not
gonna work on me.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.976
Especially when I can call
lacey right now and find out
the truth.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.878
- Call her.
- I will.

10:49.048 --> 10:51.916
- <i>( cell phone rings, beeps )</i>
<i>- oh, hey, charlie.</i>

10:51.918 --> 10:54.819
- Can you talk?
- Yeah, I'm not doing anything.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.354
Oh, and I took your advice.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.957
I'm hand-free.
Super safe.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.793
- ( horn honks )
- one lane, grandma.
I'm doing my eyes.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.329
Lacey, I need you
to tell me the truth.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.997
Are you and sean
having a relationship?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.899
Hot sean from the group?

11:07.901 --> 11:09.434
Yes, lacey,

11:09.436 --> 11:12.037
"hot sean from the group."

11:12.039 --> 11:14.839
No. I'm just helping him
find a job,

11:14.841 --> 11:16.808
You know,
because I care about people.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.811
- ( horn honks )
- walk faster, you fat ass.

11:19.813 --> 11:23.314
Lacey, you've never
lied to me before,
so if you tell me

11:23.316 --> 11:25.950
There's nothing
going on with you and sean,
I will believe you.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.186
Of course not
'cause that would be
against the rules.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.888
I mean, you've still got
that rule, right?

11:29.890 --> 11:30.955
'cause if you don't have
that rule, then--

11:30.957 --> 11:32.791
I still got the rule!

11:32.793 --> 11:35.994
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'll see you in group.
Bye-bye.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.028
God.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.867
So, uh,
what technique

11:42.869 --> 11:45.704
Do you call it
when you find out that
I was telling the truth?

11:45.706 --> 11:48.873
Technique 14b:

11:48.875 --> 11:51.943
Where the accuser realizes
that he was wrong all along

11:51.945 --> 11:53.878
And should've minded
his own business.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.246
Huh.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.016
So...

11:58.018 --> 12:01.019
♪ someone deserves
a cupcake. ♪

12:04.057 --> 12:07.826
Go away, you lying,
cheating piece of crap!

12:09.395 --> 12:11.830
<i>It's charlie.</i>

12:11.832 --> 12:13.298
Oh.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.867
Well, then,
it still applies.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.435
I hate you all.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.806
Look,
I know you're upset,

12:21.808 --> 12:24.876
But I'm gonna tell you
something that's gonna
make you very, very angry.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.445
And then
I'm gonna kill you.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.848
But wait,
there's more.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.751
I'm also gonna tell you
something that's gonna
make you very, very happy.

12:32.753 --> 12:36.154
So why don't we
just focus on the happy
and blow off the rest?

12:36.156 --> 12:38.490
- What is it?
- Remember that stupid thing
I told you about sean?

12:38.492 --> 12:40.358
He was all, you know,
cheating and everything.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.993
Well, guess what.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.295
Turns out, I goofed.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.830
And a goof doesn't
sound so bad, right?

12:45.832 --> 12:48.266
So he wasn't cheating?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.468
Actually, I found out that
he was going out at night

12:50.470 --> 12:53.338
Trying to get a job at a club
and lacey was helping.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.073
I'm sorry.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.909
I kicked him
out of the house
all because of you?

12:57.911 --> 12:59.344
Yes.

12:59.346 --> 13:02.280
That's the great news!
Congratulations!

13:04.116 --> 13:05.450
Hi, babe.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.352
Perfect timing.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.387
Babe, why did you
bring me flowers?

13:09.389 --> 13:11.823
- I'm the one who was wrong.
- No, babe.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.325
I know how bad you felt when
you thought I cheated on you

13:14.327 --> 13:16.261
And I don't ever
want you to go through
something like that.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.430
I should have just told you
where I was in the first place.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.066
Oh, babe.

13:25.237 --> 13:27.305
Oh.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.542
( moans )

13:30.544 --> 13:32.877
All right, well,
I'm gonna...

13:34.980 --> 13:37.048
Just gonna...

13:39.919 --> 13:42.020
Unless, of course,
you guys need anything.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.421
Nothing at all?

13:43.423 --> 13:44.889
You're both good?
Awesome.

13:48.394 --> 13:51.329
Gin. I win.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.998
Seems a little unfair
you won't teach us the rules.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.037
Does anybody
want anything to eat?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.371
I'm going to the bedroom.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.874
Why do you keep food
in the bedroom?

14:02.876 --> 14:04.843
Why do I sleep
in the kitchen?

14:04.845 --> 14:06.444
I like to mix it up.

14:10.049 --> 14:12.183
Should we be worried
about nolan?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.551
I mean, I had no idea
he was living

14:13.553 --> 14:15.386
In such abject poverty

14:15.388 --> 14:17.555
With only
a bird to talk to.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.591
Are you kidding me?

14:19.593 --> 14:21.159
When I was his age,

14:21.161 --> 14:23.561
I was sloshing through
the jungle dodging enemy fire

14:23.563 --> 14:27.599
With nothing
but a necklace of ears
to talk to.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.436
Which is why this baby
is my best friend.

14:31.438 --> 14:34.639
Ed, would you please
put that thing back
in your...

14:34.641 --> 14:36.574
Belt bag.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.544
It's called a holster,
patrick.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.880
And if you knew
anything about guns,

14:41.882 --> 14:44.949
You would know
that they don't
go off randomly.

14:44.951 --> 14:47.352
They can't be fired
if the safety's on

14:47.354 --> 14:50.355
Or if the clip is out.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.625
Here.
Hold it.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.929
I will hold it
this one time.

15:00.099 --> 15:01.599
Just to say that I--

15:09.141 --> 15:11.042
Oh, my god.
I killed his bird.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.313
Oops.

15:16.548 --> 15:18.650
Must have been one left
in the chamber.

15:18.652 --> 15:21.119
Why does that
always happen?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.021
Are the robbers back?!

15:23.023 --> 15:25.556
Uh, yeah,
they did a drive-by.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.359
We're okay, but I think
your bird got winged.

15:31.530 --> 15:34.065
Oh, man.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.633
I am so sorry, nolan.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.335
I was holding the gun

15:37.337 --> 15:40.038
And it just went off.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.539
I'll never forgive myself.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.142
Poor little guy.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.583
( stapler clicks )

15:52.585 --> 15:54.218
There.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.653
Good as new.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.724
Honey, you can't staple
a bird back to life.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.460
Sure, you can.
Turtle's been dead
for 10 years.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.329
He was my best friend,

16:04.331 --> 16:06.397
So I had him stuffed.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.034
I'm scared.
I wanna go home.

16:12.371 --> 16:14.639
Thank you for taking me
out to dinner, charlie.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.341
Are you kidding me?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.643
After everything
I put you through,
it's the least I can do.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.278
I'm just glad
she took you back.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.347
Yeah, the last few days
have been great.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.182
The first night
she felt bad,

16:24.184 --> 16:26.551
We had some of the most
amazing makeup...

16:26.553 --> 16:28.586
Conversation that
I have ever had.

16:29.621 --> 16:31.522
I could barely talk
the next day.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.727
So you boys
ready to order?

16:35.729 --> 16:37.996
Yes, I am.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.431
I think I'm gonna do
the prime rib.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.033
Maybe two.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.335
I had a boyfriend
who ate two prime ribs once.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.771
Of course,
he was getting executed
the next morning.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.308
Can I have
one more minute, please?

16:50.310 --> 16:52.243
That's the last thing
he said.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.547
- Hi, lace.
- Hey, charlie.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.517
Hey, sean.
What's going on?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.686
I just wanted to buy
you both a drink

17:01.688 --> 17:04.122
And apologize to you guys
for accusing you of
sleeping together.

17:05.124 --> 17:07.291
Thanks, but not necessary.

17:07.293 --> 17:08.760
No, no.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.562
I owe you
an explanation.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.531
I overreacted because

17:13.533 --> 17:16.034
Sean's been living
with my ex-wife.

17:18.570 --> 17:19.704
Oh, really?

17:19.706 --> 17:21.706
You're living
with charlie's ex-wife?

17:21.708 --> 17:24.709
Did I not mention that
while we were talking
about clubs?

17:25.778 --> 17:28.413
You son of a bitch.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.482
But you guys aren't
seeing each other, lacey.

17:31.484 --> 17:36.354
Because I've been
screwing him for two weeks.

17:37.322 --> 17:39.724
Charlie: <i>Oh, wow.</i>

17:39.726 --> 17:41.726
This may be
a little awkward,

17:41.728 --> 17:43.628
But wanna join us
for dinner?

17:46.565 --> 17:47.765
Gut instinct.

17:47.767 --> 17:52.737
You were showing up
with way too much stuff
for a guy who was innocent.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.105
All right.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.808
My love for jen
is so strong that I got--

17:56.810 --> 17:58.443
( mimics buzzer )
not good enough.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.211
Okay. All right.
( chuckles )

18:00.213 --> 18:03.181
This is really--
this is hard for me
to admit, okay?

18:03.183 --> 18:04.682
It is.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.151
I don't believe that anybody
could love me unconditionally.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.720
- ( mimics buzzer )
- I'm a sex addict.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.390
- ( mimics buzzer )
- my babysitter touched me.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.625
( mimics buzzer )

18:14.627 --> 18:18.496
The correct answer is...
I'm leaving town.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.534
- <i>( knocks on door )</i>
<i>- come in.</i>

18:23.536 --> 18:25.536
<i>( music playing on tv )</i>

18:32.411 --> 18:34.712
Okay.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.547
You're watching
old movies,

18:36.549 --> 18:38.850
Eating ice cream,

18:38.852 --> 18:40.818
Drinking bourbon,

18:40.820 --> 18:42.787
And cutting up
old pictures of sean.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.589
I know already.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.691
Lacey called me
to apologize.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.227
So you're doing
every cliché,

18:49.229 --> 18:51.262
Brokenhearted girl
ritual at once?

18:51.264 --> 18:53.431
Yes, but I'm not
feeling any better yet.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.501
I gotta find a way
to speed this up.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.806
A bourbon float.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.876
That'll be perfect
at birthday parties
for alcoholic kids.

19:06.578 --> 19:10.515
Sweetie, alcohol
and ice cream are not
gonna solve your problems.

19:12.384 --> 19:14.519
Holy crap,
that's good.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.456
You need to get away
and go somewhere.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.359
( crying )
I don't have any money.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.927
It'll be my treat.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.362
Okay.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.430
I've always wanted
to go to Italy.

19:30.469 --> 19:33.371
I was thinking more
the doubletree in
palm springs.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.506
They give you a cookie
at check-in.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.511
Hey, she's back.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.580
What's with leaving
the front door open?

19:42.582 --> 19:44.649
What is a door, anyway?

19:44.651 --> 19:47.752
My heart's open,
my mind's open,
my door's open.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.321
It's all the same thing,
you know what I mean?

19:50.323 --> 19:51.856
No, no one does.

19:53.825 --> 19:56.794
I just feel so enlightened
after the weekend
in the desert.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.496
Thank you
for sending me away.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.631
So I take it you had
a good time in palm springs.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.500
Mm. That kinda sucked,

20:02.502 --> 20:04.569
But I met these
super-cool people.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.238
So I jumped in their van
and spent the weekend
at burning man.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.840
Wow. Well, at least
you came back with
a cool story.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.210
Oh, I came back
with more than that.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.811
Hey, beautiful.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.847
I made some kind, vegan
grilled cheese sandwiches.

20:18.317 --> 20:19.717
Blessing, friend.

20:22.521 --> 20:26.557
- Hugs are free.
- Yeah, so are not hugs.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.526
This is my
ex-husband charlie.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.261
Charlie,
this is canvas.

20:30.263 --> 20:33.397
- Canvas.
- I'm open to interpretation.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.833
Yeah, I get it.
I know what a canvas is.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.703
Such a playful spirit
he has.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.539
Ooh, I made some
superfood goji berry
lemonade.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.941
- I'll go get it.
- Okay.

20:46.645 --> 20:49.280
What is that?

20:49.282 --> 20:50.982
I'll tell you
what that is.

20:50.984 --> 20:52.650
That's sweet.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.453
That's considerate.
That's honest.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.922
Yeah, but don't you think
he's maybe a little bit...

20:57.924 --> 21:01.459
Young, hot, and stupid?
Yeah, and I'm okay with that.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.795
In fact, I'm looking forward
to it two, maybe three
times a day.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.699
Well, as a person
who's been guilty of

21:08.701 --> 21:11.302
Young, hot,
and stupid...
Have fun.
