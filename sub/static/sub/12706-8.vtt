I was concerned.

12:58.472 --> 13:00.909
Or...ooh. Thought.

13:00.953 --> 13:03.826
We're-we're just assuming
someone else cut off the ear.

13:03.870 --> 13:07.481
What if it was self-
inflicted, like Van Gogh?

13:07.524 --> 13:10.832
So, she brutally
stabbed herself,

13:10.876 --> 13:13.488
dumped the body
and then cut off her own ear?

13:13.530 --> 13:15.663
No. She cut off her ear,

13:15.706 --> 13:16.970
then killed herself,

13:17.013 --> 13:18.841
then dumped the body...

13:18.884 --> 13:21.625
I'm really off my game,
aren't I?

13:21.669 --> 13:23.541
Yeah.

13:23.585 --> 13:27.501
Wait. Something's
missing from this case.

13:27.544 --> 13:30.504
"Early 1800s
Chumash knife."

13:30.548 --> 13:32.072
There's a picture.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.421
What's it look like?

13:33.463 --> 13:34.900
BUFFY:
Pretty darn scary.

13:34.943 --> 13:36.510
It was more like a riot
than a Ralph's.

13:36.553 --> 13:38.077
I thought I was gonna
have to use slayer moves

13:38.120 --> 13:39.948
on this one woman
who was completely hoarding

13:39.993 --> 13:41.037
the pumpkin pie filling.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.517
And at some point,

13:42.559 --> 13:44.345
you are going to tell me
about the murder?

13:44.388 --> 13:46.695
Oh, right. Uh,

13:46.738 --> 13:49.131
the knife was
some sort of Indian artifact.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.567
Chumash, I think.

13:50.611 --> 13:51.961
That's all we got.

13:52.004 --> 13:53.484
Oh, Chumash Indians.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.485
They were indigenous
to this whole area.

13:55.529 --> 13:57.575
That's interesting.
Then, of course,

13:57.619 --> 13:59.490
the, um, the murder weapon

13:59.533 --> 14:01.971
might have just been
a convenient choice.

14:02.014 --> 14:04.538
Uh-uh. There was a big ol'
scissors lying right there.

14:04.581 --> 14:06.105
That knife was picked
for a reason.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.976
Do you even own a turkey pan?

14:08.020 --> 14:11.240
Tell me again why we're not
doing this at your house.

14:11.284 --> 14:15.549
Giles, if you would like to
get by in American society,

14:15.592 --> 14:17.333
then you are going to have
to follow our traditions.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.552
You're the patriarch.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.727
You have to host
the festivities,

14:19.770 --> 14:21.163
or it's all meaningless.

14:21.207 --> 14:22.904
And this is in no way
an elaborate scheme

14:22.948 --> 14:24.775
to stick me with the cleanup?

14:24.820 --> 14:27.562
How about that
ceremonial knife, huh?

14:27.605 --> 14:29.693
Pretty juicy piece of clueage,
don't you think?

14:29.738 --> 14:31.740
Yes, all right.
I'll look into the, uh,

14:31.783 --> 14:33.394
Chumash connection
and see if there's any

14:33.437 --> 14:36.004
ritual significance
to the ear removal.

14:36.048 --> 14:37.179
Thank you.

14:38.615 --> 14:39.573
You all right?

14:39.616 --> 14:43.011
Yeah. Uh...

14:43.056 --> 14:44.753
I still need to pick up
a few things,

14:44.796 --> 14:46.537
so I'll check in.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.278
And keep your hands
off the food.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.975
Oh, I'll try and
restrain myself

14:50.019 --> 14:52.673
from eating uncooked
potatoes and cranberries.

14:59.245 --> 15:00.899
So, what do you think?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.426
She sounds good.

15:05.469 --> 15:08.515
Kind of intense about
this Thanksgiving thing.

15:08.558 --> 15:10.996
I think perhaps
she's a little lonely,

15:11.039 --> 15:14.434
but I meant about the murder.

15:14.477 --> 15:16.176
Whatever killed the woman
in the museum,

15:16.219 --> 15:17.741
that's probably the danger.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.091
Yeah, well, this danger,
your-your friend

15:19.134 --> 15:21.355
has some ominous vision
about Buffy?

15:21.398 --> 15:22.791
It's all terribly vague.
I mean, there are

15:22.833 --> 15:24.445
other things happening
on this campus.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.099
Well, maybe I'm wrong,
but I got to try something.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.187
I can't just keep watching.

15:28.230 --> 15:30.015
You know, I'm glad that you're
watching out for her,

15:30.058 --> 15:31.886
but I feel I should remind you
that she's not helpless

15:31.931 --> 15:33.409
and it's not your job
to keep her safe.

15:33.453 --> 15:35.977
It's not yours anymore, either.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.153
Are you gonna walk away?

15:38.197 --> 15:39.460
All right.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.070
But I feel we should tell her.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.768
I don't like
keeping this secret.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.248
No. If she knew
I was here, I...

15:45.292 --> 15:47.772
Look, it would distract her,
it could get her hurt.

15:47.816 --> 15:51.167
I don't... I don't want it
to get in the way.

15:53.255 --> 15:55.998
Um, I'm assuming that
there is some connection

15:56.042 --> 15:59.567
to the old mission. Something
is angry about being disturbed.

15:59.610 --> 16:02.570
Or maybe it was trapped there
and now it's released.

16:02.613 --> 16:05.572
Something that has a fondness
for ancient weapons.

16:05.615 --> 16:08.270
You know Father Gabriel?No.

16:08.315 --> 16:09.837
He knows the history
of this place pretty well.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.447
His family dates back
to mission times.

16:11.491 --> 16:13.363
He might be able
to fill in some blanks.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.931
Okay, well, I'll see
about contacting him.

16:15.975 --> 16:20.109
Where are you going?To watch her.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.371
It's not fair. You know
that's what she'd say.

16:22.416 --> 16:25.418
You can see her, but
she can't see you?

16:25.461 --> 16:28.725
Believe me, I'm not getting
the good half of this deal.

16:28.769 --> 16:31.163
To be on the outside
looking in at what I can't...

16:34.080 --> 16:37.518
Well, I'd forgotten
how bad it feels.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.873
[muffled groans]

16:53.576 --> 16:55.536
Aah!

16:57.232 --> 17:00.889
[laughing]

17:00.932 --> 17:04.284
But you have whipped cream.
I saw it in Giles' fridge.

17:04.326 --> 17:05.894
But that's whipped
cream in a canister.

17:05.935 --> 17:08.156
Look, it's only right
if you whip it yourself.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.289
Hey, and then later,
we can churn our own butter

17:10.333 --> 17:12.727
and make sweaters
out of sheep.

17:12.769 --> 17:15.337
Okay. It's the last
thing. I promise.

17:15.382 --> 17:17.078
Besides, I have
an appointment

17:17.123 --> 17:19.298
with that priest that
Giles called about.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.951
He thinks he might have
some information.

17:20.996 --> 17:24.913
RILEY:
Buffy? Hey, Buffy.

17:24.954 --> 17:27.307
Riley. Where'd
you come from?

17:27.348 --> 17:28.438
I didn't see
you at all.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.961
Oh, just across the street.

17:30.005 --> 17:32.268
And a couple of blocks down.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.443
Hey, Willow.

17:34.488 --> 17:35.967
Hi.

17:36.010 --> 17:38.361
Well, I'm just gonna
let you two...

17:38.404 --> 17:41.756
Look, they're selling coffee
in the coffee shop.

17:41.798 --> 17:42.973
Yum.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.242
Oh! Angel...

17:50.286 --> 17:52.375
[muffled]:
Evil. You're all evil again.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.508
I'm not evil.
I'm here to help Buffy.

17:54.550 --> 17:57.467
What's going on?

17:57.510 --> 17:59.382
My friend had a vision.
Buffy's in danger.

17:59.425 --> 18:01.210
So tell her. Help her.

18:01.253 --> 18:02.993
If she sees me, it'll be worse.

18:03.038 --> 18:04.605
See, I don't get that.

18:04.647 --> 18:07.346
All this-this "leaving
for her own good" garbage.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.348
Because that's what it is.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.351
You-you can't just give up
because there's obstacles.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.743
Do you know what kind of...Willow.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.136
Sorry. My stuff.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.138
You know how I feel about her.

18:17.182 --> 18:18.705
If there was any way...

18:18.749 --> 18:20.403
Yeah. I know.

18:20.446 --> 18:23.711
It's just...
everything's different now.

18:23.753 --> 18:26.365
Hey, is Cordelia
really working for you?

18:26.409 --> 18:29.064
I mean, 'cause that's got to
be a special experience.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.413
Of all the people you
could've hired...

18:30.457 --> 18:32.198
Willow, I'm here
to protect Buffy.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.852
I don't have a whole lot of time
for personal stuff.

18:34.895 --> 18:36.984
Right. Well, how can I help?

18:37.028 --> 18:40.118
Well, if you can just tell me...

18:42.469 --> 18:44.165
Who's that guy?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.950
It'll be just like
it was when I was a kid.

18:45.993 --> 18:48.823
Only without me building a fort
out of my mashed potatoes.

18:48.865 --> 18:50.215
Sounds like fun.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.434
It will be.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.436
Um, you know,

18:54.480 --> 18:56.526
if you don't
already have plans...

18:56.569 --> 18:58.659
you should come.

18:58.701 --> 19:01.051
I'm a great cook.
In theory.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.096
I've eaten a lot.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.445
That sounds so great,

19:03.490 --> 19:05.230
but I'm outta here tonight.

19:05.273 --> 19:07.189
I caught a last-minute flight
back to Iowa.

19:07.232 --> 19:09.583
Iowa. That's one of the ones

19:09.625 --> 19:11.672
in the middle, right?

19:11.714 --> 19:13.413
My folks are there.

19:13.455 --> 19:15.284
We always do Thanksgiving
at my grandparents' house.

19:15.327 --> 19:16.633
A little farm outside Huxley.

19:16.676 --> 19:18.679
Sounds nice.

19:18.721 --> 19:21.071
It is. After dinner,

19:21.115 --> 19:24.205
we, um, we all go for a walk
down by the river with the dogs.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.425
There's trees and...

19:26.469 --> 19:28.471
and I know what you're thinking.

19:28.515 --> 19:30.211
It's like I grew up
in a Grant Wood painting.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.605
Exactly. If I knew
who that was.

19:32.648 --> 19:34.085
Just a guy who painted stuff

19:34.128 --> 19:35.391
that looked like
what I grew up in.

19:35.434 --> 19:38.307
Well, have fun
at the homestead.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.569
Always do. What's the line?

19:40.614 --> 19:43.269
Home's the place that,
when you have to go there...

19:43.311 --> 19:44.487
They have
to take you in.

19:44.530 --> 19:46.315
Get out.

19:46.358 --> 19:48.273
But, baby, this is
where I belong.

19:48.317 --> 19:49.449
Out. I mean it.

19:49.491 --> 19:51.232
I've been doing
a lot of reading,

19:51.277 --> 19:53.626
and I'm in control
of my own power now,

19:53.670 --> 19:54.671
so we're through.

19:57.934 --> 20:00.894
You don't mean that.

20:00.938 --> 20:03.897
Yes, I do.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.855
I... I do.

20:10.383 --> 20:11.513
I mean it a lot.

20:15.474 --> 20:18.391
See?

20:18.433 --> 20:20.306
I knew you'd end up
welcoming me back

20:20.348 --> 20:23.526
with open... arms.

20:26.921 --> 20:29.531
No. I'm powerful,

20:29.576 --> 20:30.750
and I'm beautiful,

20:30.794 --> 20:33.318
and I don't need you
to complete me.

20:33.362 --> 20:34.537
And you're mean.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.758
You had that in our bed?

20:40.717 --> 20:42.501
Do you know how
dangerous that is?

20:42.545 --> 20:43.676
Let's find out.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.721
You wouldn't do it.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.506
You did it to me,
remember?

20:46.548 --> 20:48.986
All right, all right.
I'll go. Just...

20:49.029 --> 20:50.378
What?

20:50.423 --> 20:52.947
Can I have someone to eat?

21:04.393 --> 21:06.394
Father Gabriel?

21:11.269 --> 21:12.357
Father Gabriel?

21:19.799 --> 21:21.932
Father?

21:21.976 --> 21:23.759
Are you out here?

21:26.588 --> 21:27.589
God.

21:33.988 --> 21:36.032
You can't stop me.

21:36.076 --> 21:37.470
You're very wrong about that.

21:37.512 --> 21:38.818
[grunts]

21:47.653 --> 21:48.785
I am vengeance.

21:48.828 --> 21:50.700
I am my people's cry.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.572
They call for Hus,

21:52.615 --> 21:55.965
for the avenging spirit
to carve out justice.

21:56.009 --> 21:58.272
They tell you to start
an ear collection?

22:10.546 --> 22:13.243
You slaughtered my people.

22:13.288 --> 22:15.376
Now you kill their spirit.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.901
This is a great day for you.

22:37.703 --> 22:41.316
It's clear we're dealing
with a spirit of some kind.

22:41.359 --> 22:42.622
It's very common
for Indian spirits

22:42.664 --> 22:44.624
to change to animal form.

22:44.666 --> 22:47.278
Yeah, well it's
plenty uncommon for me

22:47.322 --> 22:50.412
to freeze up during a fight.
I mean, I had the guy,

22:50.455 --> 22:52.326
I was ready for the takedown
and I stopped.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.894
And Native American.

22:53.936 --> 22:55.416
Sorry?

22:55.461 --> 22:57.854
We don't say "Indian."

22:57.897 --> 23:00.116
Oh, right. Yes, yes.

23:00.161 --> 23:02.031
Um, always behind
on the terms.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.817
Still trying not
to refer to you lot

23:03.859 --> 23:05.296
as "bloody colonials."

23:05.339 --> 23:07.342
And the thing is,

23:07.385 --> 23:09.474
I like my evil like
I like my men...

23:09.518 --> 23:11.085
evil. You know,

23:11.127 --> 23:13.304
"straight up, black hat,
tied to the train tracks,

23:13.347 --> 23:15.915
soon my electro-ray
will destroy Metropolis" bad.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.917
Not all mixed up with guilt
and the destruction

23:17.961 --> 23:19.659
of an indigenous culture.

23:19.701 --> 23:22.704
This uh, spirit warrior--
Hus, you called him--

23:22.749 --> 23:25.272
has killed innocent people.

23:25.316 --> 23:26.883
Okay, you know what,
we need to boil those

23:26.926 --> 23:28.580
and then put them
through the ricer.

23:28.624 --> 23:31.584
Uh, I don't think
I have a ricer.

23:31.626 --> 23:34.455
You don't have a ricer?
What do you mean?

23:34.500 --> 23:36.240
How could someone
not have a ricer?

23:36.284 --> 23:37.720
W-Well, do you have one at home?

23:37.763 --> 23:39.895
I don't know.
What's a ricer?

23:39.940 --> 23:41.462
We'll mash them with forks,

23:41.507 --> 23:42.898
much like the pilgrims
must have.

23:42.942 --> 23:45.031
Did you catch the part
about the innocent people?

23:45.075 --> 23:47.512
Yes. Okay?
And I do want to stop him.

23:47.556 --> 23:50.732
I'd just like to find
a non-slayey way to do it.

23:52.734 --> 23:55.128
[knocking]

24:00.568 --> 24:01.961
Hey.Hey. Peas?

24:02.005 --> 24:04.007
Peas.

24:05.617 --> 24:07.836
Wh... These are frozen.

24:07.881 --> 24:09.838
What's all that?Atrocities.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.884
I got the full poop
on the Chumash Indians

24:11.928 --> 24:14.409
and our fabulous
buried mission.

24:14.452 --> 24:17.064
You said you were
gonna get fresh ones.Atrocities?

24:17.106 --> 24:18.718
Peas. They come in little pods,
you were gonna shell them.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.936
I-I didn't have time.
I was busy

24:20.980 --> 24:22.286
reading about the Chumash War.

24:22.329 --> 24:23.722
The Chumash were peaceful.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.550
Oh, they were peaceful,
all right. They were

24:25.594 --> 24:28.204
fluffy indigenous kittens,
till we came along.

24:28.249 --> 24:29.555
They're gonna be mushy.

24:29.597 --> 24:30.730
They won't be mushy.

24:30.772 --> 24:32.731
I like mushy peas.

24:32.775 --> 24:34.342
You're the reason
we had to have pilgrims

24:34.384 --> 24:36.083
in the first place.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.693
So what happened
to the Chumash?

24:38.738 --> 24:41.740
How about imprisonment,
forced labor,

24:41.784 --> 24:43.786
herded like animals
into a mission

24:43.829 --> 24:45.875
full of bad European diseases.

24:45.919 --> 24:48.616
Boy. The Cultural
Partnership Center

24:48.661 --> 24:50.444
really didn't stress
any of that stuff.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.230
Not even a diorama.
And it gets better.

24:53.273 --> 24:56.538
The-the few Chumash
who tried to rebel were hanged.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.018
A-And when a group

24:58.060 --> 25:00.715
was accused of stealing
cattle, they were killed.

25:00.759 --> 25:02.718
Men, women, and children.

25:02.761 --> 25:06.200
And for proof to bring back
to their accusers...

25:06.242 --> 25:09.769
They cut off their ears?

25:09.811 --> 25:11.988
So Hus wasn't kidding about
the rightful vengeance routine.

25:12.031 --> 25:15.209
He's recreating all the wrongs
done to his people.

25:15.251 --> 25:16.210
And it's up to us
to stop him.

25:16.252 --> 25:19.169
Yes, but after dinner, right?

25:19.212 --> 25:20.953
Are you sure we
shouldn't be helping him?

25:20.997 --> 25:23.739
No, I think perhaps
we won't help the angry spirit

25:23.782 --> 25:26.828
with his rape
and pillage and murder.

25:26.873 --> 25:28.482
Well, okay,
no, but

25:28.527 --> 25:29.788
we should be helping him
redress his wrongs.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.224
Bring the
atrocities to light.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.140
Well, if the history books
are full of them,

25:33.182 --> 25:34.576
I'd say they already are.

25:34.619 --> 25:36.838
Giving his
land back.

25:36.883 --> 25:38.753
You know what,
we could always just...It's not exactly ours to give.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.669
You know, I don't think
you want to help.

25:40.712 --> 25:42.497
I-I think you just want to
slay the demon, then go...

25:42.540 --> 25:43.759
♪ La la la You know...

25:43.802 --> 25:45.934
And I think your-your
sympathy for his plight

25:45.979 --> 25:48.154
has blinded you
to certain urgent facts.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.765
We have to stop
this thing.

25:49.808 --> 25:51.680
Okay,
unfeeling guy.

25:51.723 --> 25:52.986
Oh Willow,
that's not fair.

25:53.028 --> 25:55.770
I have to baste.

25:59.078 --> 26:00.863
[whispering]:
Willow, I...

26:00.906 --> 26:02.385
I have reason to believe
that Buffy herself

26:02.430 --> 26:05.738
may be in particular danger
from this menace.

26:05.780 --> 26:07.869
You mean... Angel?

26:07.913 --> 26:09.523
I saw him, too.

26:09.567 --> 26:11.003
That's not terribly
stealthy of him.

26:11.047 --> 26:12.744
I think he's lost his edge.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.834
But Buffy doesn't know?

26:14.876 --> 26:16.878
No, no, not a peep.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.837
Well, that's good, but...
but this is why I think

26:18.881 --> 26:20.622
we should all keep
a level head in this.

26:20.665 --> 26:22.798
And I happen to think
mine is the level head

26:22.842 --> 26:25.105
and yours is the one
things would roll off of.

26:25.147 --> 26:27.150
[knocking]

26:32.807 --> 26:34.330
Happy Thanksgiving.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.681
WILLOW:
Xander.

26:35.723 --> 26:37.638
You look like death.Are you okay?

26:37.682 --> 26:39.292
You didn't bring rolls?

26:54.700 --> 26:56.744
The doctor couldn't figure out
what was up with me.

26:56.788 --> 26:59.313
He said I had a lot of symptoms
that didn't connect.

26:59.355 --> 27:01.228
I think they do connect.

27:01.270 --> 27:04.361
What, to this Chumash spirit
vengeance guy?

27:04.404 --> 27:05.753
Well, didn't you say the Chumash
got all diseased

27:05.798 --> 27:07.320
when they were all
holed up in the mission?

27:07.364 --> 27:09.845
Yeah. Uh, this has
a better account

27:09.888 --> 27:11.367
of everything.
It lists the various...

27:11.412 --> 27:14.284
Various? As in...

27:14.327 --> 27:16.852
Well, the important thing
is not to panic.

27:16.895 --> 27:18.593
Well, you just recited
the mystical

27:18.636 --> 27:21.335
panic-causing incantation,
so little hope there.

27:21.377 --> 27:24.250
Let's talk about the various.

27:24.294 --> 27:27.515
Well, they...
they did suffer from malaria,

27:27.557 --> 27:29.385
some smallpox...

27:29.430 --> 27:31.300
I was gonna say smallpox.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.390
You know, syphilis,
but basically standard...

27:33.433 --> 27:35.522
Syphilis?

27:35.566 --> 27:38.526
Well, but this is
probably mystical,

27:38.568 --> 27:40.788
and-and it'll all go away
as soon as...

27:40.833 --> 27:43.704
As soon as what? We still
don't know what we're gonna do.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.924
Well, maybe I can
find something.

27:45.968 --> 27:47.752
Let's give him some land.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.363
I'm sure that'll
clear everything right up.

27:49.405 --> 27:51.104
Sarcasm accomplishes
nothing, Giles.

27:51.146 --> 27:53.584
It's sort of an end in itself.

27:53.627 --> 27:54.890
Hey, can we come rocketing
back to the part

27:54.933 --> 27:56.892
about me and my new syphilis?

27:56.935 --> 27:59.589
It'll make you blind and insane,
but it won't kill you.

27:59.634 --> 28:01.375
The smallpox will.

28:01.417 --> 28:04.856
Maybe there's-there's a Wiccan
spell that can cure it.

28:04.900 --> 28:07.729
You know, something regular
medicine doesn't know about.

28:07.772 --> 28:10.297
Ooh, th-there was a potion.

28:10.339 --> 28:13.778
Sage, salt...onion?

28:13.821 --> 28:16.564
That's the stuffing.Oh, God.

28:16.606 --> 28:19.306
Oh, you're gonna get
vesicles, then pustules.

28:19.348 --> 28:20.741
They have pictures.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.352
I hate this guy.

28:22.395 --> 28:24.789
Well he's just doing
what was done to him.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.616
I didn't give him syphilis.

28:26.661 --> 28:29.142
No, but you freed his spirit,
and after a century of unrest,

28:29.184 --> 28:31.012
he saw you as
one of his oppressors.

28:31.057 --> 28:34.843
What, so he rises up and infects
the first guy he sees?

28:34.886 --> 28:36.758
That's no fair.

28:36.801 --> 28:38.978
Like you've never
woken up cranky?

28:39.020 --> 28:40.848
But why the others?
Why them particularly?

28:40.893 --> 28:43.329
So we take this guy out.

28:43.373 --> 28:46.462
Buffy, it is for to be slaying
sometime soon, yeah?

28:46.507 --> 28:49.465
That's sort of the question
before the court.

28:49.509 --> 28:50.729
Question?

28:53.165 --> 28:54.863
There are two sides to it.

28:54.906 --> 28:56.211
To slaying him?

28:56.256 --> 28:58.213
Well, the representative
from syphilis votes yea.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.388
It's not that simple.

28:59.432 --> 29:00.955
He's a vengeance demon.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.348
You don't talk
to vengeance demons.

29:02.392 --> 29:05.613
You kill them.

29:05.655 --> 29:07.135
I didn't know
you felt that way.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.659
What?

29:08.702 --> 29:10.443
Anyway, he's a spirit,
not a demon.

29:10.487 --> 29:12.141
Yes, and we've never faced
this sort of spirit before.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.361
We really don't know
what will kill it.ANYA: A demon has to do

29:14.403 --> 29:16.363
what a demon has to do.Again with the killing.

29:16.405 --> 29:17.625
XANDER: Oh, right.
It's still evil.Figuratively speaking.

29:17.667 --> 29:19.060
Or bind it or whatever.
Yes, Willow,

29:19.105 --> 29:20.846
we all appreciate
your perspective.

29:20.888 --> 29:23.239
You know, sometimes vengeance
is justified.It's not about perspective,

29:23.282 --> 29:25.285
it's about doing what's right.You know that I didn't mean you.

29:25.327 --> 29:26.676
GILES: It's not right to let a
murder go unpunished!I don't think anyone appreciates

29:26.721 --> 29:28.722
the truth of the situation.Oh, I think we do.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.028
ANYA: You're just saying
all this 'cause you're

29:30.071 --> 29:30.986
intimidated by me.This is no good!

29:36.251 --> 29:38.340
It needs more condensed milk.

29:41.561 --> 29:43.606
Buffy, Xander is in real danger.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.826
Are you sure
the solution is pie?

29:45.871 --> 29:47.741
Over bickering and
confusion, I'll take pie.

29:47.786 --> 29:48.829
We will find
a solution.

29:48.874 --> 29:51.484
And we will have
a nice dinner, okay?

29:51.528 --> 29:53.095
Both. End of story.

29:53.138 --> 29:54.314
I'm going to have Thanksgiving,

29:54.356 --> 29:55.444
and it is going to be perfect.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.185
Hus won't stop.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.188
Vengeance is never sated, Buffy.

29:59.231 --> 30:02.060
Hatred is a cycle.
All he will do is kill.

30:02.104 --> 30:03.758
[knocking]

30:16.596 --> 30:18.511
Help me. Oh!

30:18.555 --> 30:20.209
[sizzling]

30:20.252 --> 30:23.733
What part of "help me"
do you not understand?

30:23.778 --> 30:25.432
The part where I help you.

30:25.474 --> 30:28.739
Come on,
I'm-I'm parboiling out here.

30:28.782 --> 30:30.088
Want me to help
make it quicker?

30:30.132 --> 30:31.525
Invite me in.

30:31.567 --> 30:34.180
No.Fairly unlikely.

30:35.049 --> 30:36.269
Oh! Damn it.

30:39.315 --> 30:42.927
[coughs]
Look, I'm safe.

30:42.971 --> 30:45.104
I can't bite anyone. Willow,

30:45.146 --> 30:46.757
tell 'em what I did.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.064
You said you were gonna
kill me, then Buffy.

30:49.107 --> 30:52.023
Yes, bad, but let's
skip that part

30:52.067 --> 30:53.939
and get to the part
where I couldn't bite you.

30:53.981 --> 30:55.201
It's true.

30:56.593 --> 30:58.116
He had trouble performing.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.902
Yeah, well, it looks like
they've done me for good.

31:00.945 --> 31:03.035
Um...

31:03.077 --> 31:04.688
what are you saying?

31:04.731 --> 31:06.994
I'm saying that Spike
had a little trip to the vet

31:07.038 --> 31:08.910
and now he doesn't chase
the other puppies anymore.

31:08.953 --> 31:10.477
I can't
bite anything.

31:10.519 --> 31:12.044
I can't even hit people.

31:12.086 --> 31:14.741
So you haven't murdered
anybody lately?

31:14.785 --> 31:17.353
Let's be best pals.

31:17.396 --> 31:19.528
I've got information.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.488
About the soldier boys
you were fighting.

31:21.530 --> 31:23.358
I've got the inside scoop.

31:25.012 --> 31:27.929
Come on, what have you
got to be afraid of?

31:29.321 --> 31:31.932
First people who dwell
in Mishupashup,

31:31.977 --> 31:34.761
hear me and descend.

31:34.805 --> 31:39.288
Walk with me upon
Itiashup again.

31:39.332 --> 31:42.161
Hear me also, Nunashush.

31:42.203 --> 31:44.771
Spirits from below,

31:44.815 --> 31:47.557
creatures of the night,

31:47.601 --> 31:51.170
take human form
and join the battle.

31:51.212 --> 31:54.041
Bring me my revenge.

32:05.270 --> 32:07.229
Ow! Bloody hell, woman.

32:07.272 --> 32:09.230
You're cutting off
my circulation.

32:09.275 --> 32:10.624
You don't have
any circulation.

32:10.666 --> 32:12.625
Well, it pinches.

32:12.669 --> 32:14.192
Well, get
used to it.

32:14.236 --> 32:15.977
I have more important
things to worry about.

32:16.020 --> 32:17.805
I came to you in friendship.

32:17.847 --> 32:20.025
Well, all right,
seething hatred,

32:20.067 --> 32:21.416
but I've got useful information,

32:21.461 --> 32:23.332
and I feel I'm being mistreated.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.813
So tell me
everything you know.

32:25.855 --> 32:28.250
I'm too hungry
to remember everything.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.990
Then sit.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.384
Uh, how much butter
goes in with these?

32:32.427 --> 32:34.996
About half a stick
and a quarter cup of brandy.

32:35.039 --> 32:37.606
You do have brandy, don't you?

32:37.651 --> 32:41.046
What? Uh, oh, uh, yes.

32:41.088 --> 32:44.048
Um, on the, uh, bookcase.

32:44.092 --> 32:46.573
I wouldn't say no
to a brandy.What's wrong?

32:46.615 --> 32:49.618
The victims.
Apart from Xander,

32:49.663 --> 32:51.621
Hus has targeted
authority figures.

32:51.664 --> 32:55.233
Father Gabriel, the curator
of the cultural center.

32:55.277 --> 32:56.931
Who else
fits this pattern?

32:56.974 --> 32:58.498
Just a small brandy.The dean.

32:58.540 --> 33:00.500
Dean Guerrero.
I mean, he's the king of us,

33:00.542 --> 33:02.196
and he was at the ceremony.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.678
Likely candidate.
We should warn him.Will,

33:04.721 --> 33:06.027
anything in those books about

33:06.070 --> 33:08.595
how to stop a Native American
spirit guy?

33:08.637 --> 33:11.728
Some nice, non-judgmental way
to, you know, kill him?

33:11.771 --> 33:14.949
I'm not gonna help you kill him.
I'm not on board.

33:14.992 --> 33:16.645
Will, what choice do we have?

33:16.690 --> 33:19.126
Buffy, this isn't a western.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.738
We're-we're not at Fort... Giles

33:21.781 --> 33:23.305
with the cavalry
coming to save us.

33:23.348 --> 33:25.176
It's one lonely guy.

33:25.220 --> 33:28.048
Oppressed warrior guy
who-who's just trying to...

33:28.093 --> 33:30.224
Kill a lot of people?

33:30.269 --> 33:32.140
I didn't say he was right.

33:32.183 --> 33:34.185
Will, you know how bad
I feel about this, okay?

33:34.229 --> 33:36.188
It's eating me up.
A quarter cup of brandy

33:36.230 --> 33:38.058
and let it simmer.
But even though it's hard,

33:38.103 --> 33:39.930
we have to end this.

33:39.973 --> 33:41.758
Yes, he's been wronged,
and I personally

33:41.801 --> 33:43.281
would be ready
to apologize, but I d...

33:43.325 --> 33:47.286
Oh, someone put a stake in me.

33:47.328 --> 33:49.330
You got a lot
of volunteers in here.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.682
I just can't take all this
mamby-pamby boo-hooing

33:52.726 --> 33:55.119
about the bloody Indians.

33:55.163 --> 33:56.685
Uh, the preferred term is...

33:56.730 --> 33:58.297
You won. All right?

33:58.339 --> 34:01.125
You came in and you killed them,
and you took their land.

34:01.169 --> 34:03.301
That's what conquering
nations do.

34:03.345 --> 34:05.259
It's what Caesar did,
and he's not going around

34:05.304 --> 34:08.742
saying, "I came, I conquered,
I felt really bad about it."

34:08.784 --> 34:11.309
The history of the world
is not people making friends.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.876
You had better weapons
and you massacred them.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.226
End of story.

34:15.268 --> 34:18.186
Well, I think the Spaniards
actually did a lot of...

34:18.230 --> 34:19.795
Not that I don't like Spaniards.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.494
Listen to you.
How you gonna fight anyone

34:21.536 --> 34:22.797
with that attitude?

34:22.842 --> 34:25.237
We don't want to fight anyone.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.152
I just want to have
Thanksgiving.

34:27.195 --> 34:30.545
[chuckles]
Yeah, good luck.

34:30.590 --> 34:31.938
Well, if we could talk to him...

34:31.981 --> 34:34.724
You exterminated his race.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.509
What could you possibly
say that would

34:36.552 --> 34:39.032
make him feel better?
It's kill or be killed here.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.512
Take your bloody pick.

34:40.556 --> 34:42.905
Maybe it's the syphilis talking,

34:42.949 --> 34:45.344
but some of that made sense.

34:45.387 --> 34:47.346
I made a lot of these points
earlier, but no,

34:47.389 --> 34:48.737
it's fine, no one listens to me.Look, fine,

34:48.782 --> 34:51.567
okay? But someone still
has to go warn the dean.

34:51.610 --> 34:54.003
I'll go. I need the air.

34:54.047 --> 34:56.268
Not alone.I'll go.

34:56.311 --> 34:57.311
Me, too.

34:57.356 --> 34:58.313
You sure you're up to it?

34:58.356 --> 34:59.532
Oh, leave that one--

34:59.574 --> 35:01.751
he looks like he's ready
to drop any minute,

35:01.795 --> 35:04.275
and I think I can eat someone
if he's already dead.

35:04.318 --> 35:05.972
I'm up to it.

35:06.016 --> 35:09.280
I'll, uh, keep on looking
for a solution.

35:09.324 --> 35:11.934
Yeah. Guys, the dean's house
is up past the gym.

35:11.978 --> 35:15.242
And hurry.
Dinner's in an hour.

35:18.202 --> 35:21.554
Hey, when
do I get fed?

35:21.597 --> 35:24.034
Later. I hope
the others are okay.

35:24.077 --> 35:25.557
Do you know what
happens to vampires

35:25.601 --> 35:27.211
who don't get to feed?

35:27.255 --> 35:29.213
I always
wondered that, actually.Giles, plates.

35:29.257 --> 35:31.041
Living skeletons, mate.

35:31.085 --> 35:34.306
Like famine pictures from
those dusty countries,

35:34.349 --> 35:36.438
only not half as funny.

35:36.481 --> 35:38.961
You can have gravy.
That has blood in it, right?

35:39.005 --> 35:41.226
Do you know what else
has blood in it? Blood.

35:41.268 --> 35:43.097
Do I have to gag you?

35:43.141 --> 35:45.447
Because I am not gonna
listen to you whine

35:45.490 --> 35:46.969
all the way through my dinner.

35:47.014 --> 35:49.059
It's gonna be a nice,
quiet, civilized...

35:52.280 --> 35:55.065
You. Listen, maybe
I wasn't clear before

35:55.108 --> 35:56.849
about how terrible
we all feel.

35:56.893 --> 35:59.592
'Cause we're trying to help.What's going on?

35:59.635 --> 36:02.681
It isn't working.Uh, you can have
casinos now.

36:06.119 --> 36:08.340
Get down!

36:08.382 --> 36:10.646
What about me? You gonna
leave me here like this?

36:14.083 --> 36:16.608
Hey! Watch the heart.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.221
Well, that was
a waste of time.

36:20.264 --> 36:22.092
I think he thought
we were crazy.

36:22.135 --> 36:24.007
Maybe if Anya hadn't opened
the conversation with

36:24.050 --> 36:25.400
"Everybody got
both ears?"

36:25.443 --> 36:28.489
I liked his wife.
She gave me pie.

36:28.534 --> 36:29.577
So, what do
we do now?

36:29.621 --> 36:31.840
Well, we could stay here
and stand watch,

36:31.885 --> 36:33.233
or I just don't...

36:33.277 --> 36:34.235
ANGEL: Willow.

36:34.278 --> 36:36.628
Angel?

36:36.672 --> 36:38.282
So this is Angel.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.327
He's large and glowery,
isn't he?

36:40.371 --> 36:41.460
He's evil again.

36:41.503 --> 36:42.938
I-I'm not evil again.

36:42.983 --> 36:44.463
Why does everyone think that?

36:44.505 --> 36:45.942
Angel's here to protect Buffy.

36:45.985 --> 36:47.596
Yeah, I haven't been evil
for a long time.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.380
She's not supposed
to know he's here.

36:49.423 --> 36:50.730
Angel, do you
have something new?

36:50.773 --> 36:51.905
Yeah.
All the Chumash weapons

36:51.947 --> 36:53.297
are missing from
the cultural center.

36:53.340 --> 36:54.733
Something's up.
Where's Buffy?

36:54.777 --> 36:56.865
Still at Giles'. She sent us
to check on Dean Guerrero.

36:56.909 --> 36:58.519
Why the dean?

36:58.563 --> 37:01.523
Well, we think he's going after
someone in charge. A leader?

37:01.567 --> 37:03.264
He's a warrior.
To a warrior, the leader means

37:03.307 --> 37:05.440
the strongest
fighter.

37:05.483 --> 37:07.442
Buffy.

37:07.485 --> 37:08.530
He's formed
a raiding party.

37:08.574 --> 37:10.097
Oh, we got to get over there.

37:10.139 --> 37:11.532
I'll call her.
You get back fast.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.143
Here,
you guys can ride.

37:14.753 --> 37:16.494
[phone rings]

37:16.538 --> 37:19.541
H-Hello? Yes.[arrows whistling,
glass shatters]

37:19.585 --> 37:21.326
Um yes, w-we're
well aware of that.

37:21.369 --> 37:24.632
We-we're under siege
now, actually. Thank you.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.460
Who was that?

37:26.505 --> 37:29.724
A... Um, someone.
Uh, we need a plan.

37:29.768 --> 37:32.250
Yes. Let's talk
about it some more.

37:33.554 --> 37:34.512
Where's your weapons chest?

37:34.556 --> 37:36.210
Over there.

37:40.561 --> 37:42.215
Ow!Buffy!

37:42.260 --> 37:44.391
[grunts]

37:46.612 --> 37:48.570
Remember that
conquering nation thing?

37:48.614 --> 37:49.483
Forget it. Apologize.

37:49.527 --> 37:51.224
Shut up, Spike.

37:51.268 --> 37:53.400
Fine, I'll do it myself.
Hey, sorry.

37:53.445 --> 37:54.706
Sorry about that, chief.

37:56.490 --> 37:58.449
How many?Uh...

37:58.492 --> 37:59.972
Uh, the leader upstairs.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.539
About two by the
living room windows.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.411
Uh, one through
the window by the door.

38:04.456 --> 38:06.545
It's too many.We need help.

38:19.731 --> 38:22.603
[arrows whistling by]Okay, one...

38:22.648 --> 38:23.865
two... three.

38:37.445 --> 38:38.880
HUS:
Stop them!

38:48.586 --> 38:50.110
Enough!

38:55.550 --> 38:56.768
[grunting]

39:06.692 --> 39:08.998
Ow! Bloody hell.

39:18.311 --> 39:20.619
Ow!

39:20.661 --> 39:21.967
Giles, these guys--
they don't die.

39:22.010 --> 39:24.362
Bit busy over here.

39:32.891 --> 39:33.893
Hey!

39:43.250 --> 39:46.253
Why won't you die?

39:49.387 --> 39:50.822
[crack]

39:50.865 --> 39:53.391
What's he like
when he isevil?

40:08.101 --> 40:09.407
Aah!

40:14.498 --> 40:15.630
Help the others.

40:36.956 --> 40:38.478
Your knife can kill you.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.356
A bear!

40:46.400 --> 40:47.619
You made a bear.

40:47.661 --> 40:49.358
I didn't mean to.

40:49.402 --> 40:50.708
Undo it! Undo it!

41:08.682 --> 41:10.815
Hey, Gentle Ben, over here.

41:13.688 --> 41:15.036
That's for giving me syphilis.

41:19.606 --> 41:20.739
[growls]

42:10.309 --> 42:12.833
What happened? Did we win?

42:12.878 --> 42:15.358
I feel lousy.

42:15.402 --> 42:18.012
Well, the turkey came out
rather splendidly.

42:18.056 --> 42:20.407
Oh, it was yummy.

42:20.449 --> 42:23.235
It's just... did you see me?

42:23.278 --> 42:24.802
Two seconds of conflict

42:24.846 --> 42:26.630
with an indigenous person,
and I...

42:26.673 --> 42:29.284
I turn into General Custer.

42:29.329 --> 42:32.592
Violence does that.
You know, instinct takes over.

42:32.637 --> 42:34.552
Yeah, that's the fun.

42:35.813 --> 42:37.510
Nobody asked you.

42:37.554 --> 42:39.731
Oh, lay off.

42:39.773 --> 42:42.210
You all had a fine meal.

42:42.255 --> 42:43.822
But me?

42:43.864 --> 42:46.519
An entire siege.

42:46.563 --> 42:48.608
You'd think one of you
would bleed a little.

42:48.652 --> 42:50.742
Good work, Buffy.

42:50.784 --> 42:52.873
On, you know, on both counts.

42:52.918 --> 42:55.181
Thanks.

42:55.224 --> 42:57.617
Well, you know, you should
be very pleased.

42:59.706 --> 43:02.840
Wasn't exactly
a perfect Thanksgiving.

43:02.884 --> 43:06.844
I don't know.
Seemed kind of right to me.

43:06.887 --> 43:08.498
A bunch of anticipation,
a big fight,

43:08.541 --> 43:09.760
and now we're all sleepy.

43:09.804 --> 43:12.632
[chuckles]
And we did all survive.

43:12.677 --> 43:15.766
I guess that much is true.

43:15.809 --> 43:18.856
First Thanksgiving on my own,
and we all got through it.

43:18.900 --> 43:20.684
And you know what?

43:20.728 --> 43:23.556
I think my syphilis
is clearing right up.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.777
And they say romance is dead.

43:26.820 --> 43:28.780
Or maybe they just wish it.

43:28.822 --> 43:31.695
Well, maybe we started
a new tradition this year.

43:33.740 --> 43:35.742
Maybe not.

43:35.786 --> 43:37.831
But at least
we all worked together.

43:37.876 --> 43:39.659
It was like old times.

43:39.704 --> 43:41.922
Yeah, especially with Angel
being here and everything.

43:48.929 --> 43:50.235
XANDER:
Oops.

43:50.278 --> 43:52.280
[silverware clangs]

44:25.139 --> 44:27.664
Grr. Argh.
