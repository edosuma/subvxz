WEBVTT

00:01.180 --> 00:02.901
- Okay, sign there.
- All right.

00:03.144 --> 00:04.295
And there.

00:04.564 --> 00:06.799
And give me your John Hancock
right there.

00:07.072 --> 00:08.109
And you are done.

00:08.325 --> 00:12.041
- All right. What about the Smith case?
- Settled.

00:12.755 --> 00:15.228
- The amendments to my living trust?
- Filed.

00:15.513 --> 00:17.872
Did you take care
of my donation to the...?

00:18.145 --> 00:20.710
Children's Foundation. Got it.
It's going through in the morning,

00:20.986 --> 00:23.789
and, may I say,
that is a very generous donation.

00:24.121 --> 00:26.160
Yeah, well, it was the least I could do.
Believe me.

00:26.837 --> 00:29.116
I couldn't have gotten through
all this without you, Paige.

00:29.386 --> 00:31.027
You have been a miracle worker.

00:31.309 --> 00:33.543
Thank you. You should have seen me
at my other temp jobs

00:33.814 --> 00:35.455
if you wanna see miracles.

00:36.949 --> 00:42.157
This is for you.
It's just my way of saying thank you.

00:42.548 --> 00:44.507
- I really can't...
- Just take it.

00:44.970 --> 00:46.850
I know a good soul
when I see one.

00:47.979 --> 00:49.096
Thank you.

00:51.490 --> 00:54.453
So you better go. I'm sure
your family would never forgive me

00:54.749 --> 00:57.827
- if I kept you here past midnight.
- Okay.

00:58.134 --> 00:59.934
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:06.993 --> 01:08.828
I wouldn't count on it.

01:33.152 --> 01:35.272
No, no, no!

01:35.951 --> 01:37.147
Behind you, Paige!

01:42.344 --> 01:43.904
No, Paige!

01:47.776 --> 01:51.458
- Larry?
- Forget it, witch! You lost him.

03:41.476 --> 03:45.077
- Let's try just a little bit. It's good stuff.
- Good morning!

03:46.239 --> 03:48.279
So how was your date?

03:48.538 --> 03:50.099
Don't ask.

03:51.631 --> 03:52.907
You need a hand?

03:53.177 --> 03:55.091
Sure, if you want to go
get my car washed,

03:55.350 --> 03:57.663
go to the dry cleaners for me
and go to work for me too.

03:57.982 --> 04:00.980
- That would be great!
- Sure, if you run the club for me,

04:01.283 --> 04:03.357
go to the dentist
and raise Wyatt for me.

04:03.666 --> 04:05.864
Today, I would trade with you
in a second.

04:06.632 --> 04:10.473
Do you remember Spencer Ricks,
that slimy advice columnist?

04:11.270 --> 04:13.390
- The one you turned into a turkey?
- Yeah, well,

04:13.652 --> 04:15.008
I should have kept him that way.

04:15.240 --> 04:20.802
Elise just hired him away
from the competition to work with me.

04:21.257 --> 04:24.539
- Look how handsome he looks.
- Why would she do that?

04:24.851 --> 04:28.852
I don't know. I guess to promote
his hiring, she wants us to pick a letter

04:29.197 --> 04:32.673
and each give advice on it. So,
you know, one, sensitive and caring

04:33.000 --> 04:35.724
- and the other one, chauvinistic and...
- Slimy?

04:36.343 --> 04:39.864
Thank you. I have half a mind
to call Jason and complain about it,

04:40.187 --> 04:42.341
but I don't wanna use
our relationship for leverage.

04:42.611 --> 04:45.210
What's the use of sleeping
with your boss, then?

04:45.494 --> 04:47.329
Because I actually enjoy
sleeping with my boss.

04:47.624 --> 04:48.615
Yeah, don't brag.

04:48.836 --> 04:52.677
- Not getting any is making you bitter.
- Hello. Hi. Excuse me.

04:53.016 --> 04:54.896
Oh, he doesn't know
what we're talking about.

04:55.188 --> 04:58.105
He's 10 months old. He thinks we're
talking about milk, for God's sakes.

04:58.405 --> 04:59.806
Phoebe, he conjured a dragon.

05:00.035 --> 05:02.189
- I wouldn't put anything past him.
- Good point.

05:02.792 --> 05:05.026
Now, if he could only find a way
to keep guys from bolting

05:05.300 --> 05:07.613
every time they lay eyes on him...

05:07.933 --> 05:09.813
It's not easy dating
as a single mom.

05:10.063 --> 05:12.183
There's gotta be lots of guys
out there that like kids.

05:12.446 --> 05:16.810
Yeah, I haven't met any so far.
So I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

05:17.209 --> 05:20.730
I've got three dates lined up. They're all
gonna meet Wyatt on the first date,

05:21.053 --> 05:22.614
and if they don't like it, tough.

05:22.892 --> 05:24.613
You could always turn them
into a turkey.

05:28.366 --> 05:30.121
Where you been?

05:31.167 --> 05:33.001
Paige?

05:33.758 --> 05:37.553
Paige, what happened?
What's the matter?

05:38.396 --> 05:39.912
What time is it?

05:40.150 --> 05:43.193
Eight. Were you out all night?

05:43.577 --> 05:45.731
- Yeah, I guess I was.
- Come here, mister.

05:47.337 --> 05:50.939
- You hang on right there.
- Okay. Sit down here for a second.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.015
Talk to us.

05:54.733 --> 05:58.255
I lost an innocent last night.
A demon killed him right in front of me.

05:58.577 --> 06:00.731
- Oh, God.
- At your temp job?

06:01.043 --> 06:03.766
Yeah. I should have seen it coming.

06:04.052 --> 06:06.890
Every other job,
someone's wound up needing my help.

06:07.187 --> 06:10.742
- I just don't know why I didn't see it.
- Well, maybe you weren't meant to.

06:11.115 --> 06:13.679
No, I was. I just... I didn't.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.743
Even worse, when I tried to save him,
he wound up saving me.

06:19.596 --> 06:22.034
I just wish I knew
what was going on.

06:22.312 --> 06:24.033
Why they were after Larry
in the first place

06:24.276 --> 06:25.951
and how he knew
they were coming for him.

06:26.198 --> 06:28.432
- What do you mean, he knew?
- He just did.

06:29.082 --> 06:30.643
He was finalising his will,

06:31.339 --> 06:34.781
making donations,
tried to get me out of there.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.618
- He knew.
- How could he have known?

06:37.899 --> 06:40.896
I don't know,
unless maybe he wasn't so innocent.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.434
Which is probably why
you weren't meant to save him.

06:43.999 --> 06:46.313
No, I don't believe that.

06:46.590 --> 06:49.348
Look, Paige,
even if he was an innocent,

06:49.641 --> 06:52.079
you can't save everybody.
I mean, that's just the lesson

06:52.397 --> 06:54.392
we've all had to learn, unfortunately.

06:54.697 --> 06:55.927
I know.

06:56.870 --> 06:58.784
Paige, you can't blame yourself
for what happened.

06:59.042 --> 07:02.758
If you were meant to save him,
you would've. You have to believe that.

07:05.644 --> 07:07.046
I can't.

07:36.818 --> 07:38.379
Leo. What are you doing here?

07:38.657 --> 07:41.780
- Get off of me!
- Are you following me again?

07:42.124 --> 07:43.685
I thought we were past
these issues.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.694
- What is that?
- That? Nothing.

07:47.013 --> 07:48.209
No?

07:51.652 --> 07:53.007
What the hell?

07:54.451 --> 07:56.251
Long story.

07:57.251 --> 07:59.894
What is that, a time portal? Is that it?
What are you using it for?

08:00.176 --> 08:02.375
- I don't have to answer that.
- Thought you said

08:02.641 --> 08:04.875
- you had nothing to hide?
- I don't have to answer that.

08:05.149 --> 08:07.268
- Wanna bet?
- No.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.926
- Where are we?
- How the hell should I know?

08:32.226 --> 08:34.460
That's what I was trying to tell you.
I can't control it.

08:34.734 --> 08:36.169
Yeah.

08:48.232 --> 08:51.674
- So if there's anything that I can do...
- Thank you.

08:51.993 --> 08:54.431
I just can't believe that he's gone.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.190
I know.

08:56.420 --> 08:59.144
I'm grateful that he was not alone
when it happened.

08:59.721 --> 09:03.847
I know that he didn't know you long,
but I'm glad you were with him.

09:04.694 --> 09:06.449
I just wish I'd gotten there sooner.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.320
Well, there's nothing
you could have done.

09:09.582 --> 09:12.864
He had a heart attack.
It was his time, I guess.

09:14.430 --> 09:16.264
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.

09:17.981 --> 09:20.453
I just...
I mean that he was so young.

09:21.116 --> 09:23.075
And from everything
that people have said,

09:23.331 --> 09:26.487
he was just this great guy,
you know?

09:26.799 --> 09:30.879
- It just doesn't seem fair.
- No, it doesn't, does it?

09:33.234 --> 09:36.676
Listen, Mrs. Henderson,
I feel weird asking you this,

09:37.036 --> 09:40.478
but was he acting
any differently before?

09:40.797 --> 09:43.315
I'm sorry, I have to go now.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.717
But if there is anything you need,
just call me.

09:47.023 --> 09:49.667
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

09:53.292 --> 09:55.092
I don't mean to be taking up
all of your time.

09:55.339 --> 09:56.694
No, wait, please.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.703
What made you ask that?

10:00.730 --> 10:05.528
It's just some of the things that
he asked me to do for him before...

10:06.998 --> 10:09.915
It's just almost as if he knew
something was gonna happen.

10:10.758 --> 10:14.360
Actually, he knew about a lot of things
before they would happen.

10:14.685 --> 10:17.443
In fact, sometimes I almost thought
that he was clairvoyant.

10:17.778 --> 10:21.094
- Really?
- I mean, at least in business anyway.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.963
Up until a couple of years ago,
we had nothing.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.697
Flat broke, going nowhere.

10:27.974 --> 10:31.576
- And then, just all of a sudden...
- All of a sudden?

10:31.902 --> 10:34.181
I don't know, it was like
he won the lottery or something.

10:35.746 --> 10:39.462
Suddenly he couldn't lose.
Every deal he made was golden.

10:40.051 --> 10:42.889
And at first he was happy,
of course,

10:43.560 --> 10:44.711
but then he wasn't.

10:46.318 --> 10:50.763
And whenever I would ask him
how he did it or how he knew,

10:51.124 --> 10:55.967
he would just say that he could sense,
you know, what was about to happen.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.354
What could that possibly mean?

11:01.738 --> 11:04.655
Excuse me.
His brother's on the phone.

11:04.954 --> 11:06.710
Excuse me.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.797
Hi, Paige.

11:13.103 --> 11:14.094
Richard.

11:14.315 --> 11:16.708
Last time I saw you,
you were kind of saving my life.

11:18.159 --> 11:19.150
How are you?

11:23.425 --> 11:25.464
As I live and breathe. Feeble.

11:26.099 --> 11:29.063
Where you been?
What, are you keeping bankers' hours?

11:29.860 --> 11:33.302
Turkey. Okay, first of all,
get your feet off my desk.

11:33.663 --> 11:35.817
And secondly, get out of my chair.

11:37.256 --> 11:39.615
And here I thought
we were gonna be friends.

11:39.930 --> 11:41.332
Now!

11:41.895 --> 11:47.058
All right, all right.
Jeez, keep your panties on.

11:52.967 --> 11:54.449
Nice.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.180
Okay, let's get a couple
of things straight here.

11:57.438 --> 11:59.194
I didn't ask for this
and I don't like it.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.845
- So don't push it, or else...
- Or else what?

12:03.289 --> 12:04.884
You know what?
Let's just pick a letter.

12:05.126 --> 12:08.043
Well, let's start with there is nothing
good in this pile of drivel.

12:08.344 --> 12:11.068
I mean, there's some lady
who wants to break up with a loser,

12:11.395 --> 12:14.198
another who wants
to be closer to Mommy.

12:14.487 --> 12:17.086
And this one,
she's worried about losing her virginity.

12:17.371 --> 12:19.764
It's like a freaking PMS convention.

12:20.378 --> 12:21.449
Let me ask you a question.

12:21.674 --> 12:27.076
Do you ever get letters from anybody
other than a bunch of whiny chicks?

12:42.986 --> 12:44.387
As you were saying?

12:49.087 --> 12:50.078
Piper.

12:50.675 --> 12:52.475
Ryan, hi.
Good, you got my message.

12:52.722 --> 12:55.366
Yeah, my secretary caught me
before I left.

12:55.648 --> 12:58.086
I thought we were gonna meet
at the restaurant.

12:58.405 --> 13:01.927
- Yeah, sorry. Something came up.
- Is everything okay?

13:02.250 --> 13:03.447
Yeah, everything's fine.

13:03.712 --> 13:07.267
It's just that my babysitter cancelled
at the last minute.

13:07.598 --> 13:09.432
Babysitter?

13:10.021 --> 13:11.821
You have a baby?

13:14.743 --> 13:16.338
What do you think?

13:17.291 --> 13:19.331
I think...

13:19.883 --> 13:21.478
...he's adorable.

13:21.762 --> 13:23.437
- You do?
- Absolutely.

13:23.686 --> 13:25.920
- What's his name?
- Wyatt.

13:26.192 --> 13:28.757
So you're okay with this?
You still wanna go out?

13:29.075 --> 13:30.876
What, are you kidding?
I love babies.

13:31.123 --> 13:33.277
Although, I think we should go
to Chuck E. Cheese now.

13:33.546 --> 13:36.464
- You mind?
- No. I'll just grab my purse.

13:36.765 --> 13:39.078
Sure. Hey.

13:39.356 --> 13:41.555
Hey there, big fella!

13:41.862 --> 13:44.940
You wanna go with Mommy and me
to lunch, huh?

13:50.471 --> 13:51.872
Oh, my...

13:52.142 --> 13:56.587
We should probably take separate cars
because of the baby seat.

13:59.915 --> 14:02.433
Hi. What are you doing?

14:07.144 --> 14:09.538
Well, fine.

14:14.038 --> 14:15.918
Actually, I'm all by myself
in the house now.

14:16.169 --> 14:19.645
My mom moved out,
Eve's family followed.

14:19.972 --> 14:22.970
It's weird to think the only thing
holding us together was a feud.

14:23.272 --> 14:28.754
- Makes me sorry I helped end it.
- Don't be. It's an amazing freedom.

14:31.756 --> 14:34.399
You're really beating
yourself up, huh?

14:34.681 --> 14:35.718
Yeah, I guess I am.

14:35.935 --> 14:38.089
You know, I think I was put
in Larry's life for a reason

14:38.358 --> 14:40.923
and it probably wasn't
just to watch him die.

14:41.198 --> 14:43.478
You really believe in that stuff,
don't you?

14:43.747 --> 14:46.904
- What?
- Fate. Destiny.

14:47.216 --> 14:48.732
Yeah, don't you?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.886
I didn't. Not until I met you.

14:52.022 --> 14:56.626
With all the magical wars in my family,
if there's some kind of grand plan,

14:56.994 --> 14:57.984
it sucks.

15:00.923 --> 15:02.644
What are you smiling at?

15:02.928 --> 15:07.293
Nothing, it's just kind of nice to talk to
someone about all this magic-y stuff.

15:07.650 --> 15:09.804
I mean, other than my sisters,
of course.

15:10.115 --> 15:12.349
What do they think
you should do about Larry?

15:12.622 --> 15:14.023
Basically, just let it go.

15:15.212 --> 15:19.259
Well, if you'd have let it go with me,
I probably wouldn't be alive right now.

15:20.061 --> 15:22.819
Still, I wouldn't even know
where to start.

15:24.155 --> 15:25.306
Start with Larry.

15:27.749 --> 15:29.869
Wouldn't be the first ghost
you've summoned.

15:33.724 --> 15:37.040
The cream of the crop,
ladies and demons.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.563
The best souls you'll find up for auction
anywhere in the underworld.

15:40.870 --> 15:43.229
Guaranteed, or your powers back.

15:43.503 --> 15:44.938
Straighten up!

15:45.216 --> 15:48.658
Take for example,
Larry Henderson here.

15:49.019 --> 15:52.495
Now, I'll spare you the pitiful details
of his life and only say,

15:52.822 --> 15:55.660
that thanks to me, he became
one of the most prominent lawyers

15:55.955 --> 16:00.320
in San Francisco.
Friends, don't let this one get away.

16:00.719 --> 16:04.479
He's a true prize for any soul collector,
eater or trader.

16:04.855 --> 16:08.058
So, what say we start the bidding
at two powers?

16:13.756 --> 16:15.192
- Find him!
- Yes, sir.

16:22.154 --> 16:23.988
- Welcome back, Larry.
- What?

16:35.526 --> 16:39.047
Okay, you've gotta send me back
before Zahn gets pissed.

16:39.413 --> 16:41.293
Zahn. Is that the demon that?

16:41.585 --> 16:44.981
Killed me? Yeah.
For all intents and purposes, yes.

16:45.304 --> 16:47.742
- Reverse the spell, come on.
- I can't. Not till we figure out

16:48.021 --> 16:50.061
- what's going on.
- Paige, I'm begging you.

16:50.319 --> 16:52.963
Larry, give it up.
She's stubborn when she wants to be.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.336
Trust me.

16:57.089 --> 16:59.128
- Do I know you?
- No.

16:59.387 --> 17:01.700
You know my family.
You did some accounting for us.

17:02.019 --> 17:03.900
And exactly how are you
involved with this?

17:04.694 --> 17:07.213
Just fate.

17:07.786 --> 17:10.223
Great, fate.
Well, you wanna talk about fate?

17:10.544 --> 17:13.347
If I don't live up to my end of the deal,
my wife's fate is screwed too.

17:13.636 --> 17:15.550
And I'm not gonna let that happen.
Now, come on!

17:15.851 --> 17:17.732
What, did you make
some sort of Faustian deal?

17:19.903 --> 17:21.419
Yeah.

17:22.076 --> 17:24.275
Yeah, I did.

17:24.584 --> 17:27.228
Look, I'm not proud of it. All right?

17:27.550 --> 17:32.110
But Zahn came to me five years ago,
when I was down and hurting.

17:32.481 --> 17:35.444
And he promised to pull me out of it
in exchange for my...

17:37.620 --> 17:38.771
For my soul.

17:40.086 --> 17:42.604
And last night,
payment became due in full.

17:42.927 --> 17:44.648
So that's how
you built up your firm?

17:46.939 --> 17:49.663
Among other things.

17:50.366 --> 17:53.842
But then, when I realised
how Zahn was making me rich

17:54.169 --> 17:58.089
off of other people's pain
and freak accidents,

17:58.430 --> 18:00.504
I tried to stop it.
I tried to break the deal,

18:00.771 --> 18:03.688
but when I realised I couldn't,
I tried to make amends

18:04.030 --> 18:07.712
and I tried to give away everything
before it was too late.

18:12.638 --> 18:14.233
Paige?

18:15.062 --> 18:17.455
Oh, hey, you remember Richard.

18:18.071 --> 18:19.301
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.732
- What's going on?
- Oh, you know,

18:21.998 --> 18:24.596
just summoning a ghost.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.300
- Okay, okay.
- What was I supposed to do?

18:35.579 --> 18:37.573
Just let him rot in hell
or wherever he was?

18:37.877 --> 18:40.349
That's the thing. You don't know
where you summoned him from.

18:40.635 --> 18:43.838
How do you know that demons in the
underworld aren't out looking for him?

18:44.144 --> 18:47.860
- All the more reason to save him.
- Save him? He's dead.

18:48.198 --> 18:50.079
No, he hasn't moved on yet,

18:50.329 --> 18:52.894
which means I have a chance
to save his soul before Zahn gets it.

18:53.212 --> 18:55.777
- And who is Zahn?
- The demon he made a deal with.

18:56.054 --> 18:59.416
No, that's not what I mean.
What is his level, what are his powers?

18:59.939 --> 19:02.253
<i>I don't know,
I haven't checked the Book yet.</i>

19:02.572 --> 19:04.726
So you have no idea
what you're up against?

19:05.414 --> 19:07.055
No. But does it really matter?

19:07.337 --> 19:11.131
Paige, look,
I know this search is important to you

19:11.473 --> 19:13.273
and you need to maintain
a separate identity,

19:13.563 --> 19:16.081
but you can't keep
going off on your own.

19:16.362 --> 19:17.957
It's not how we work.

19:18.201 --> 19:20.720
Well, if I hadn't,
Larry's soul could've been lost by now.

19:21.042 --> 19:24.928
- He sold his soul. It was his choice.
- Well, so he makes a mistake in life.

19:25.263 --> 19:27.497
Does that mean he has to pay for it
in his afterlife too?

19:27.769 --> 19:30.493
Yeah, maybe,
because actions have consequences.

19:30.778 --> 19:33.091
We can't go around cleaning up
after everybody's mistakes.

19:33.368 --> 19:34.690
Especially mistakes like this.

19:34.915 --> 19:36.715
So, what, do you want me
to just send him back?

19:36.962 --> 19:39.196
I think that if you bring danger
into this house,

19:39.469 --> 19:41.464
you need to talk to us
about it beforehand.

19:41.726 --> 19:45.088
I did, but you weren't supportive.
Unlike Richard, who actually was.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.758
What does Richard
have to do with this?

19:48.036 --> 19:50.429
- You barely even know him.
- Maybe.

19:50.710 --> 19:52.305
But he seems to get me
more than you.

19:59.444 --> 20:02.647
Hey, listen,
thanks so much for your help,

20:02.954 --> 20:06.350
but I think maybe you better go.

20:06.673 --> 20:12.280
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, but I'll call you later.

20:13.066 --> 20:14.502
Okay.

20:15.614 --> 20:18.372
And you. Come with me.

20:18.707 --> 20:22.423
- What...? Where are we going?
- We are going to save your soul.

20:38.388 --> 20:39.982
Come on!

21:07.765 --> 21:09.406
I don't understand.
Why can't we orb?

21:09.979 --> 21:13.057
Prehistoric. Magic won't be around
till there's people around to use it.

21:13.363 --> 21:17.079
Perfect. We'll just hang out for the next
million years or so? No problem.

21:17.417 --> 21:20.415
More like 65 million.
Looks like the Cretaceous Period.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.595
Man, you are old.

21:25.148 --> 21:28.191
I think he's gone. He looks gone.
Do you think he's gone?

21:28.491 --> 21:30.851
- No.
- Neither do I.

21:35.970 --> 21:39.047
The sooner we get back to our time,
the less we'll have to worry about it.

21:39.354 --> 21:42.750
- Yeah, that's gonna be a problem.
- What do you mean?

21:43.114 --> 21:45.998
I mean, you just don't create
time portals out of thin air.

21:46.291 --> 21:47.442
It's not like that.

21:47.670 --> 21:50.906
Well, you coming back from the future
originally seemed like exact science.

21:51.222 --> 21:53.296
That was a spell, all right?
A one-way door.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.396
It only goes backward in time,
not forward.

21:55.651 --> 21:59.172
So, what, you're creating portals
to get back to the future, is that it?

22:00.205 --> 22:01.721
Why?

22:03.298 --> 22:04.779
To see if it changed, okay?

22:05.262 --> 22:07.461
To see if I stopped the demon
who was after Wyatt.

22:09.650 --> 22:11.291
What, you still don't believe me?

22:11.906 --> 22:14.709
All I care about right now
is getting back home.

22:16.754 --> 22:19.637
Well, all you gotta do is find the portal
that dumped us here. Good luck.

22:19.929 --> 22:22.402
- Watch out for the dinosaurs.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

22:22.687 --> 22:23.917
Get rid of me once and for all?

22:24.150 --> 22:27.432
<i>You were the one who sent us back
to Jurassic Park, all right? Not me.</i>

22:27.743 --> 22:29.863
Wouldn't be the first time
you tried to get rid of me.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.241
Think what you want,

22:32.465 --> 22:34.585
but know this, if we don't get back,
Wyatt's screwed.

22:34.846 --> 22:37.490
If you don't believe me, believe that.

22:39.360 --> 22:42.881
<i>- Have you tried calling for Leo?
- Yeah, he's not answering either.</i>

22:43.204 --> 22:46.167
He's probably out chasing after Chris,
and God only knows where that is.

22:46.464 --> 22:49.302
We'll have to talk to them. They're
never around when we need them.

22:49.598 --> 22:52.163
<i>Yeah, I think we need to talk
to Paige first.</i>

22:52.481 --> 22:55.558
Because this little power-of-one kick
of hers is getting out of control.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.346
Yeah, but didn't we promise her
we wouldn't butt in it anymore?

22:58.666 --> 23:01.138
Yeah, but that was when
she was just helping Richard.

23:01.465 --> 23:05.180
She wasn't yanking souls away
from angry demons.

23:06.061 --> 23:08.295
Look, I'm not saying
that we need to gang up on her,

23:08.567 --> 23:11.370
but this is clearly becoming a pattern
and we need to remind her

23:11.702 --> 23:13.936
that we have a shared destiny
to worry about too.

23:14.252 --> 23:15.812
Okay. I'll be right there.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.731
Okay, bye.

23:18.472 --> 23:22.154
All right, let's get this over with.
What do you think?

23:23.194 --> 23:25.428
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where are you going, toots?

23:25.743 --> 23:28.786
- Home, if you must know.
- Home? Are you nuts?

23:29.085 --> 23:30.406
We got a column we gotta write.

23:30.632 --> 23:35.077
And I have just found
the perfect letter for us to respond to.

23:35.479 --> 23:40.038
"Dear Pheeb, I am a breast man at
heart, but the problem is, this girl I like

23:40.409 --> 23:45.412
is flat as a board.
Should I even bother asking her out?"

23:46.844 --> 23:49.488
Now, this is a letter I can respond to.

23:53.447 --> 23:55.088
Must have been the wrong potion.

23:55.327 --> 24:00.091
Excuse me. This way, please,
this way. Inside, inside.

24:01.511 --> 24:03.311
- Brett, hi.
- Piper.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.235
I didn't think you were...

24:06.066 --> 24:07.901
...home.
- Oh, sorry it took me so long.

24:08.198 --> 24:11.276
- I had to go get my baby.
- Your baby?

24:11.624 --> 24:14.427
I actually didn't realise you were a...

24:15.302 --> 24:17.296
- A mom?
- Right, that.

24:17.559 --> 24:19.633
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, you know,

24:19.899 --> 24:22.862
some guys
just don't hear that very well.

24:23.157 --> 24:25.277
Go figure, right?

24:27.586 --> 24:30.868
Well, I don't mean to be rude,
but something's come up

24:31.180 --> 24:33.015
and I can't go out right now.

24:33.270 --> 24:36.108
So if you don't wanna reschedule,
it's perfectly understandable.

24:36.445 --> 24:37.721
Why wouldn't I?

24:37.948 --> 24:40.068
Unless you got ten more
of those somewhere.

24:40.373 --> 24:43.495
- No, just the one.
- Not a problem.

24:45.011 --> 24:46.572
Did I pass the test?

24:46.849 --> 24:48.045
With flying colours.

24:50.652 --> 24:52.054
Paige?

24:57.881 --> 25:00.480
I better...

25:01.266 --> 25:02.941
...go.

25:11.880 --> 25:14.114
You know, ordinarily I'd be upset

25:14.429 --> 25:17.152
if you summoned me, but seeing as
how you just helped me find Larry,

25:17.438 --> 25:19.558
- I'll be merciful.
- No, don't hurt her, Zahn, please.

25:19.820 --> 25:21.495
She didn't know.
She was trying to help me.

25:21.784 --> 25:22.855
Help? Really?

25:23.120 --> 25:25.685
What, you thought vanquishing me
would set him free?

25:25.962 --> 25:27.717
- Is that it?
- As a matter of fact...

25:32.398 --> 25:34.198
- You were saying?
- You're a low-level demon.

25:34.445 --> 25:36.599
- You're not supposed to have power.
- Lady,

25:36.869 --> 25:38.590
I haven't been low-level in years.

25:39.501 --> 25:44.379
Not since I started trading
souls for powers. Wanna see?

25:46.855 --> 25:48.085
Paige?

25:49.989 --> 25:51.550
Piper!

25:52.328 --> 25:54.402
And just for future reference,

25:54.668 --> 25:57.392
even if you could vanquish me,
it would only make it worse for Larry.

25:57.677 --> 26:00.115
Paragraph five,
subsection six, line three:

26:00.393 --> 26:02.786
All souls in my possession
will burn in eternal flames

26:03.067 --> 26:06.109
upon my untimely demise.
Believe me.

26:06.452 --> 26:09.335
It's a fate worse than anything
that could possibly happen at auction.

26:10.464 --> 26:13.621
A little protection clause
I put in all my contracts.

26:18.403 --> 26:20.796
Consider yourself repossessed.

26:30.731 --> 26:33.569
This would all be so much easier
if someone that could heal you

26:33.865 --> 26:35.460
was actually listening!

26:35.704 --> 26:37.538
It's no big deal, I've had worse.

26:37.793 --> 26:41.030
Still, those two need a talking-to,
I'll tell you.

26:41.386 --> 26:44.350
I don't understand this. Faustian deals
have been around for over a century,

26:44.645 --> 26:47.642
but there is nothing in here on how
to break them. How is that possible?

26:47.988 --> 26:49.709
Maybe because
they can't be broken.

26:49.995 --> 26:53.710
It can't be. There's gotta be a way.
I am not giving up on Larry now.

26:54.967 --> 26:57.644
Listen, sweetie, maybe you should.

26:57.975 --> 27:00.938
- I know you feel guilty about it...
- That's not it.

27:01.568 --> 27:04.246
It's affecting all of us now,
not just you.

27:04.537 --> 27:06.975
- I said I was sorry.
- That's not the point.

27:08.130 --> 27:10.854
Listen, I just want to save his soul.

27:11.180 --> 27:12.581
But you can't!

27:13.186 --> 27:16.184
Larry said that Zahn keeps
his contracts locked up somewhere.

27:16.487 --> 27:19.724
So if we can find and destroy them,
then we can set all those souls free.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.311
I don't think so.

27:21.584 --> 27:23.897
- Why not?
- We think we should go after Zahn.

27:24.175 --> 27:26.089
Stop him before he gets
any more powers.

27:26.390 --> 27:28.224
What, and just
let all those souls burn?

27:28.522 --> 27:30.881
They're already lost, Paige.
He's already got them.

27:32.282 --> 27:35.678
I think it's important that you stop him
before he becomes unstoppable.

27:36.043 --> 27:37.684
No!

27:38.341 --> 27:40.301
Paige, we don't like this
any more than you do,

27:40.556 --> 27:42.038
but this is where we're at.

27:42.603 --> 27:43.879
He's my innocent.

27:44.150 --> 27:47.306
Yeah, but this is our problem
and one we did not ask for, by the way.

27:47.659 --> 27:49.858
No, I'm not sacrificing him.

27:54.386 --> 27:55.981
You don't have a choice.

27:56.643 --> 27:59.765
This is beyond your control.
I'm sorry.

28:19.542 --> 28:21.901
- Hey, Paige.
- Hey, your housekeeper let me in.

28:22.175 --> 28:23.975
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, it's fine.

28:29.655 --> 28:31.614
You okay? Everything all right?

28:31.871 --> 28:33.307
No.

28:36.008 --> 28:38.732
- This looks familiar, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

28:39.643 --> 28:42.401
Maybe we should split up,
find the portal faster.

28:46.328 --> 28:47.683
Wait.

28:47.958 --> 28:51.593
If one of us gets caught, the other one
needs to keep going. For Wyatt's sake.

28:52.387 --> 28:53.663
Oh, you believe me
about him now?

28:53.890 --> 28:56.968
No, I just wanna let you know what's
gonna happen if you get caught.

29:05.674 --> 29:07.315
Found it!

29:10.313 --> 29:11.430
Leo!

29:20.760 --> 29:23.484
Come on, come on. Go. Go. Go!

29:36.723 --> 29:38.523
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:38.771 --> 29:40.571
Thanks for not listening to me.

29:40.817 --> 29:42.492
Anytime.

29:51.139 --> 29:53.213
You boys Yankees?

30:00.415 --> 30:01.406
Get up.

30:06.390 --> 30:08.510
- Here.
- Thank you.

30:11.697 --> 30:14.169
So, what are you gonna do?

30:14.455 --> 30:19.663
Well, I got a plan on how to save Larry,
but it's kind of risky.

30:20.097 --> 30:21.612
Maybe you shouldn't
go through with it.

30:21.852 --> 30:23.891
I mean,
maybe your sisters are right.

30:24.192 --> 30:26.106
You're the one who told me
to follow my instincts.

30:26.406 --> 30:29.528
I know, I just...
I don't want you to get hurt.

30:31.254 --> 30:33.327
Listen, I'm gonna need your help
to pull this off.

30:34.722 --> 30:38.084
- Paige, if I do magic...
- No.

30:38.398 --> 30:40.597
No. I am not asking you to do that.

30:41.617 --> 30:43.930
I'm just gonna need you
to get my sisters when it's time.

30:44.208 --> 30:47.364
I need their help, but they can't know
about it until it's too late to stop me.

30:47.676 --> 30:48.667
Won't they get pissed?

30:49.683 --> 30:52.247
Yeah, probably.

30:53.317 --> 30:54.799
Guess I'm pretty stubborn, huh?

30:56.199 --> 30:58.638
Yeah. In a good way.

30:59.501 --> 31:00.777
Paige...

31:01.591 --> 31:03.266
...you have a gift.

31:03.512 --> 31:04.503
Don't fight it.

31:06.229 --> 31:07.266
Thank you.

31:09.990 --> 31:10.981
Got any candles?

31:14.753 --> 31:17.876
How do we know she's not gonna
just summon him herself again?

31:18.180 --> 31:19.456
Who, Zahn?

31:19.684 --> 31:21.724
She won't try that again,
not without a potion.

31:21.983 --> 31:24.456
What about Richard?
He can make potions.

31:24.739 --> 31:26.414
Isn't he on the witch wagon, though?

31:27.079 --> 31:28.880
I'm just saying,
I wouldn't put it past her.

31:29.127 --> 31:31.087
I can't believe
it's even gotten to this point.

31:31.383 --> 31:34.461
- It'll work itself out. It always does.
- I don't know about that.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.443
I mean, we've all disagreed
with each other

31:36.691 --> 31:39.415
at one point or another
over the years, obviously,

31:39.699 --> 31:42.218
- but this is different.
- So maybe we should call her again

31:42.499 --> 31:43.490
and talk to her about it.

31:43.711 --> 31:46.469
Or we can just summon Zahn
and vanquish him quickly

31:46.762 --> 31:49.280
before she gets
her pigheaded self killed.

31:49.562 --> 31:50.552
Oh, no, pig.

31:53.114 --> 31:54.994
I'll take care of it. Don't even ask.

31:55.286 --> 31:58.523
Okay, we give him one chance
at giving up Larry's soul and that's it.

31:58.878 --> 32:00.394
Okay.

32:03.978 --> 32:08.582
<i>We call upon the ancient powers
To summon one to save his soul</i>

32:14.340 --> 32:17.064
You will be first up for auction.
Again.

32:18.268 --> 32:22.554
All right, my fellow demons,
let's start the bidding, shall we?

32:23.743 --> 32:25.657
Oh, great. Not again.

32:38.033 --> 32:39.868
- What happened?
- Where did he go?

32:43.507 --> 32:45.102
You again.

32:45.347 --> 32:47.500
- This time, it's gonna cost you.
- Wait.

32:48.019 --> 32:50.538
I'm gonna make you an offer
you can't refuse.

32:54.372 --> 32:56.411
I think you'll find
that everything's in order.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.345
You don't mind if I look it over first?

32:58.591 --> 33:02.227
Suit yourself,
but it's exactly as we discussed.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.839
You'll notice the same clause
I mentioned earlier.

33:05.110 --> 33:06.785
To protect me from your sisters,
of course.

33:07.032 --> 33:09.790
- You won't have to worry about them.
- Good.

33:11.086 --> 33:13.889
- Just sign on the dotted line.
- First Larry.

33:21.365 --> 33:25.445
- Paige, what are you doing?
- Exactly what I said I'd do.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.436
Saving you.

33:29.012 --> 33:31.211
No, Paige, don't!

33:36.576 --> 33:38.376
Have a nice afterlife.

33:55.715 --> 33:59.431
You must really be a good soul
to do what you've just done.

34:20.242 --> 34:22.476
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.677
- Did she answer?
- It's just her voice mail. Scrying?

34:34.993 --> 34:37.956
Nothing. I can't find her anywhere.

34:38.922 --> 34:40.118
You don't think Zahn?

34:40.382 --> 34:42.982
I don't know, but if he didn't, I will.
What was she thinking?

34:43.266 --> 34:44.384
Chris! Leo!

34:45.857 --> 34:48.821
- Where are those guys?
- Forget it, they're not answering.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.150
What are we gonna do?

34:56.388 --> 34:58.109
- Richard. Hi.
- Hi.

34:58.395 --> 34:59.910
- You seen Paige?
- That's why I'm here.

35:00.149 --> 35:01.824
Okay, inside, inside.

35:02.113 --> 35:03.914
- Where is she? She all right?
- I don't know.

35:04.202 --> 35:05.638
What do you mean?
What does that mean?

35:05.873 --> 35:06.864
It means...

35:09.967 --> 35:11.449
Does he do that a lot?

35:14.355 --> 35:16.030
- Wyatt.
- What is he doing?

35:16.320 --> 35:18.792
- Why is he doing that?
- Apparently, he's trying to scare away

35:19.078 --> 35:22.120
all of my dates. You little rot...
Did your father teach you that?

35:22.463 --> 35:25.505
- So not the time.
- Right. You're grounded.

35:26.349 --> 35:27.466
Okay, back to Paige.

35:27.686 --> 35:30.364
She's with Zahn,
or rather her soul is, right about now.

35:30.653 --> 35:32.727
- What?
- Yeah, it's all part of her plan.

35:32.993 --> 35:34.873
It's why I'm here.
You don't have much time.

35:35.123 --> 35:38.280
She told me to tell you to reverse
a to-call-a-Iost-sister spell?

35:38.967 --> 35:40.688
- It'll take you right to her.
- To do what?

35:41.684 --> 35:42.675
To save her.

35:45.445 --> 35:48.966
Please, everyone!
May I have your attention, please?

35:52.674 --> 35:56.720
Tonight,
I have a special treat for you.

35:57.104 --> 35:59.497
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

35:59.777 --> 36:03.572
to purchase one of the most
unique souls there is or ever was.

36:04.708 --> 36:06.942
A Charmed One,
ladies and demons.

36:08.218 --> 36:12.902
One of only three in existence.
And I have her here tonight.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.131
Both soul...

36:15.948 --> 36:17.704
...and body.

36:18.079 --> 36:20.803
To be auctioned off separately,
of course.

36:21.131 --> 36:22.168
Hurry up.

36:22.384 --> 36:24.777
Shall we start the bidding at say,
ten powers?

36:25.100 --> 36:26.330
- I'll give you 15.
- Fifteen...

36:26.562 --> 36:27.553
- Twenty!
- I have 20!

36:27.816 --> 36:29.491
And another 20 for the body.

36:29.738 --> 36:31.892
- Do I have 30?
- Thirty, just for the soul!

36:32.162 --> 36:33.757
- Any more? Thirty-two.
- Thirty-two.

36:34.042 --> 36:35.842
- Thirty-six.
- I have 36!

36:36.090 --> 36:38.244
Forty! And I'll throw in my minions.

36:38.514 --> 36:39.551
And minions!

36:41.606 --> 36:42.883
More Charmed Ones.

36:43.695 --> 36:47.411
- One hundred for all three.
- Sold. To the dead grimlock.

36:56.817 --> 36:57.853
Way to channel.

36:58.070 --> 37:00.794
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Piper, hurry. Blow up the vault!

37:12.317 --> 37:14.038
My contracts!

37:14.657 --> 37:15.854
Cut it a little close.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.923
- What the hell is going on?
- Bitch later, vanquish now!

37:19.923 --> 37:21.358
No!

37:25.146 --> 37:27.665
I love watching lawyers explode.

37:28.824 --> 37:31.137
- Now can I bitch?
- No, let me explain.

37:31.414 --> 37:34.332
I had to lure you down here. It was
the only way to destroy the contracts.

37:34.632 --> 37:37.515
- All I had to do was find them first.
- But by dying?

37:37.808 --> 37:39.163
No, I'm not dead.

37:39.397 --> 37:43.157
See, your brain has to be dead
before you can die, so I'm still alive.

37:45.456 --> 37:47.690
Okay, so where's Larry's soul?

37:48.966 --> 37:51.565
Larry's saved. He's moved on.

37:52.141 --> 37:54.500
And that was worth
risking your life for?

37:55.400 --> 37:56.722
No, I wasn't risking my life.

37:56.946 --> 38:02.633
See, I knew no matter how pissed off
you got, you'd still come and save me.

38:03.047 --> 38:04.164
We are sisters.

39:17.468 --> 39:19.109
Thanks.
We're just taking a short break.

39:19.349 --> 39:20.500
Back in 20 minutes, thank you.

39:20.728 --> 39:21.879
Piper, how did you have time

39:22.107 --> 39:25.503
to book Steadman in your club?
Between raising my nephew

39:25.825 --> 39:28.138
- and trying to date and vanquishing...
- A sister?

39:29.628 --> 39:31.223
Does that mean
you're still mad at Paige?

39:31.508 --> 39:32.625
Well, yeah, aren't you?

39:33.347 --> 39:34.862
Well...

39:35.687 --> 39:37.886
I mean, come on,
she didn't just risk her own life,

39:38.152 --> 39:41.035
she risked ours as well.
Not to mention the power of three.

39:41.370 --> 39:44.208
Yeah, I know, but don't we kind of
do that every week anyway?

39:44.505 --> 39:47.661
No, not unilaterally we don't. Ever.

39:48.014 --> 39:50.293
I'm not saying she has to answer
to us all the time

39:50.563 --> 39:53.527
or that she can't go find her bliss,
whatever that may be,

39:53.822 --> 39:55.144
but not at the risk of what we do.

39:55.369 --> 39:57.603
I totally agree, but still,

39:57.876 --> 39:59.631
we have to figure out a way
to work it out.

39:59.882 --> 40:03.278
You know, let her feel like she has a
voice in this whole thing. Compromise.

40:03.601 --> 40:06.119
Since when did you become
Solomon all of a sudden?

40:07.654 --> 40:09.853
I have surrendered
to being the middle sister.

40:10.162 --> 40:12.885
Or does it have more
to do with this?

40:15.510 --> 40:16.831
Look at that pig.

40:18.267 --> 40:21.230
And I don't mean literally.
At least, not anymore.

40:21.527 --> 40:24.604
Hey, look who it is.
Where you two been?

40:25.413 --> 40:26.404
Long story.

40:26.625 --> 40:30.466
We got a little lost, that's all, and it
took some time to find our way back.

40:31.889 --> 40:33.405
So, what did we miss?

40:35.107 --> 40:38.868
- You lay into them. I have a date.
- Hey, a date? Really?

40:39.244 --> 40:42.525
- Does he know about Wyatt?
- No. He's not gonna any time soon.

40:42.838 --> 40:46.633
- At least not till after the honeymoon.
- Hey, what did we really miss?

40:48.855 --> 40:49.846
You know what?

40:51.237 --> 40:53.071
It's a long story.

40:55.166 --> 40:57.924
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

40:58.216 --> 40:59.697
Whitelighters don't have any money.

41:00.388 --> 41:02.144
It was a gesture.

41:03.481 --> 41:05.715
- Two cold ones, Billy.
- You got it, Leo.

41:05.988 --> 41:07.789
It's on me.

41:15.599 --> 41:20.966
For Larry. May your soul
find freedom and peace.

41:23.161 --> 41:26.124
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:26.922 --> 41:28.597
What about you and your sisters?

41:29.137 --> 41:32.374
Oh, we're gonna be fine.
Just a few growing pains.

41:33.524 --> 41:37.125
I wanted to thank you, though,
for everything you've done.

41:37.494 --> 41:39.773
Hey, I just delivered a message.

41:40.963 --> 41:44.279
No, I couldn't have done it
without you.

41:45.475 --> 41:47.230
Anytime.

41:47.898 --> 41:49.813
Lucky I ran into you.

41:50.071 --> 41:51.393
Luck.

41:52.203 --> 41:53.274
It was fate.
