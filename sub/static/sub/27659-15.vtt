01:10.285 --> 01:12.636
Guys? Guess who I just
got off the phone with.

01:12.724 --> 01:13.945
- My cousin Pam.
- What? No.

01:14.033 --> 01:14.695
Why would you think that?

01:14.783 --> 01:16.468
You always seemed kind of
jealous of my relationship

01:16.555 --> 01:17.556
with him,
so I thought maybe

01:17.643 --> 01:19.314
you called him up to
settle your differences.

01:19.401 --> 01:20.704
I'm definitely
not jealous of Pam.

01:20.791 --> 01:22.274
He owns a bird shop.
I barely remember him.

01:22.361 --> 01:23.328
You remember
the bird shop.

01:23.424 --> 01:25.545
It wasn't Pam.
No, I was actually talking to

01:25.633 --> 01:27.344
- none other than Gina Linetti.
- Really?

01:27.432 --> 01:28.359
No one's heard
from her in months.

01:28.447 --> 01:30.789
Well, she just invited us
to go check out her new place.

01:30.877 --> 01:32.750
I'm surprised you're
so excited to see her.

01:32.838 --> 01:34.421
I mean, she's been blowing
you off ever since she left.

01:34.508 --> 01:35.781
- What? In what way?
- She bailed

01:35.868 --> 01:36.892
- on your birthday drinks.
- It wasn't that fun.

01:36.979 --> 01:38.632
She was a no-show
at your Secret Santa party!

01:38.719 --> 01:40.017
- Christmas is overrated.
- She hasn't called you

01:40.104 --> 01:41.587
- in months!
- I'm not that interesting.

01:41.674 --> 01:42.720
Look,
what is going on with you?

01:42.807 --> 01:44.367
- Are you hangry?
- No. I just ate

01:44.455 --> 01:45.925
- six hardboiled eggs.
- Well, maybe you should've

01:46.012 --> 01:48.078
- made it a cool "doz."
- Look, I know Gina

01:48.166 --> 01:50.157
hasn't been around very much,
but we're gonna spend time

01:50.244 --> 01:52.430
with her today, and it's gonna
be just like old times.

01:52.531 --> 01:54.023
Gina's gonna be
a few minutes.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.443
Her photo shoot
is running over.

01:55.531 --> 01:56.935
Yes, Moses!
Lookin' good!

01:57.023 --> 01:58.412
Now work those
Commandments!

01:58.500 --> 02:01.547
See, Sarge?
Just like old times.

02:02.992 --> 02:05.357
Ah, Boyle, there you are.
I have a question for you.

02:05.445 --> 02:06.273
Daddy, wait up!

02:06.361 --> 02:08.627
Oh, your non-adult is
at our place of work.

02:08.715 --> 02:10.109
Nikolaj had
a half-day at school

02:10.197 --> 02:11.498
for Mariano Rivera's
birthday.

02:11.586 --> 02:12.640
I'm watching him
on my lunch break.

02:12.727 --> 02:13.866
Nikolaj, say "hi"
to Captain Holt.

02:13.953 --> 02:15.664
Hi, Captain Holt!
How's Mr. Kevin?

02:15.752 --> 02:17.537
Stressed.
His annual budget review

02:17.625 --> 02:19.547
is today, and a recent change
in federal policy

02:19.635 --> 02:22.281
means his grant situation
is... tenuous.

02:22.461 --> 02:23.943
- At best.
- Okay.

02:24.031 --> 02:25.587
Hey Nikolaj, Daddy
and Captain Holt need to talk.

02:25.674 --> 02:27.055
Why don't you go
do some drawing?

02:27.420 --> 02:30.123
Oh, he loves doing art.
He made a portrait

02:30.211 --> 02:32.477
of our dog Biscuit that had
all of his surgical scars.

02:32.565 --> 02:34.070
Yes.
Children are wonders.

02:34.284 --> 02:37.289
I'm conducting a statistical
analysis to get a more nuanced

02:37.377 --> 02:39.781
understanding of which areas
in our jurisdiction

02:39.869 --> 02:41.781
need greater
police presence with a hope

02:41.869 --> 02:43.813
of developing a formula that...

02:44.042 --> 02:46.203
What on Walden Pond is this?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.570
Nikolaj,
no, that's important!

02:47.658 --> 02:49.320
I'm so sorry, sir.
I don't spank him,

02:49.408 --> 02:51.586
but I will reprimand
him in my own way.

02:51.862 --> 02:53.555
Niko.
I love you.

02:53.643 --> 02:55.732
- I'm so sorry, Daddy!
- No, no, no.

02:55.826 --> 02:57.277
He didn't ruin it,
he solved it.

02:57.365 --> 02:59.813
The absolute value of psi.

02:59.901 --> 03:02.555
Nikolaj cracked the equation.
Boyle...

03:02.643 --> 03:05.733
your boy is a genius!

03:06.172 --> 03:08.383
Jacob!
Terrencio!

03:08.471 --> 03:10.281
Give Moses a hug!

03:10.369 --> 03:12.813
- Uhh!
- It's so good to see you!

03:12.901 --> 03:15.281
Ugh, that shoot took forever.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.564
Did Janelle offer you a snack?

03:16.651 --> 03:18.086
She did. I had linguini.

03:18.236 --> 03:19.321
So what's been
going on with you?

03:19.408 --> 03:20.984
Well, that's actually
why I called.

03:21.125 --> 03:22.797
Uh.
It's not a big deal at all,

03:22.885 --> 03:24.279
but someone's
threatening to murder me.

03:24.366 --> 03:25.320
- What?
- Damn, Gina!

03:25.408 --> 03:26.837
I mean, I'm not worried
about it in the slightest.

03:26.924 --> 03:28.375
Anyone who has
an online presence

03:28.463 --> 03:29.633
gets meaningless threats.

03:29.721 --> 03:31.767
It actually is a sign
that I made it.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.867
- Congrats?
- Thanks, thank you.

03:33.955 --> 03:36.211
The only thing is, I have
my first speaking engagement

03:36.299 --> 03:38.477
tomorrow and the organizer
says he's going to cancel it

03:38.565 --> 03:41.266
unless I have police
protection, so...

03:41.354 --> 03:43.508
would you guys come tomorrow
and police protect me?

03:43.596 --> 03:46.547
- Yes, of course, yes.
- Oh, thanks so much.

03:47.552 --> 03:49.383
This is my agent.
I'm so sorry.

03:49.471 --> 03:51.281
Duncan, this better
be good news.

03:51.369 --> 03:54.445
<i>Oh, it is... your video's
huge, from Spokane to Spain,</i>

03:54.533 --> 03:57.318
<i>you're global, Gines!
Now, let's. Talk. Strategy.</i>

03:57.406 --> 03:58.431
This is gonna take a while.

03:58.518 --> 04:00.868
Do you guys want to get drinks
at Shaw's later and catch up?

04:00.955 --> 04:02.608
Oh, yeah.
That sounds really fun.

04:02.696 --> 04:04.141
Great.
I'll see you then!

04:04.525 --> 04:06.141
- Okay.
- So, Duncs,

04:06.229 --> 04:08.047
I have an idea
for a second book.

04:08.135 --> 04:10.594
It's a memoir,
and it's made of memes.

04:10.682 --> 04:13.086
So, it's called a meme-oir.

04:14.034 --> 04:15.949
Whoa, Rosa!
What happened?

04:16.036 --> 04:17.712
I touched poison oak.
The doctor says I have to keep

04:17.798 --> 04:20.039
my hands bandaged for a week
so I don't scratch them.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.774
- How did it happen?
- I was on a nature hike

04:21.861 --> 04:23.423
and I went off-trail
to pick a pretty little flower.

04:23.510 --> 04:24.633
Awwww.

04:24.721 --> 04:25.844
Shut up.
Now scram.

04:25.932 --> 04:26.930
I have a case
report to type up.

04:27.018 --> 04:29.359
Uh, there's no way
you're using a keyboard

04:29.447 --> 04:32.008
with your hands like that.
Oh, I could help you!

04:32.096 --> 04:35.219
Not to brag, but at typing
camp, everyone called me.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.900
"The Finger Queen."

04:37.050 --> 04:38.345
Oh, my God, that
sounds really dirty.

04:38.432 --> 04:39.766
I swear that's not
what it meant.

04:39.854 --> 04:41.564
Yeah, it was typing camp.
Nobody thinks that.

04:41.651 --> 04:42.414
Anyway,
I don't need your help.

04:42.502 --> 04:43.735
You're really gonna try
to make it through

04:43.822 --> 04:45.320
an entire day on your own?

04:45.408 --> 04:46.508
Well, well, well.

04:46.596 --> 04:48.750
Rosa Diaz is finally
gonna learn the lesson

04:48.838 --> 04:51.319
that no matter how strong
she is on her own,

04:51.407 --> 04:54.000
true strength comes from
accepting help from others.

04:54.088 --> 04:55.250
That's not what's happening.

04:56.775 --> 04:57.727
Mm-hmm, yeah.

04:57.815 --> 04:59.235
That's how normal people
take their coats off.

04:59.322 --> 05:00.406
I'm fine.

05:00.866 --> 05:02.641
- I can see that.
- This is going well.

05:02.729 --> 05:03.730
Clearly.

05:12.321 --> 05:14.256
Why are you sliding into
my side of the booth?

05:14.344 --> 05:16.029
Because that side
is the solo side.

05:16.117 --> 05:17.642
You always put the person
you want to catch up with

05:17.729 --> 05:18.759
on the solo side, otherwise
one of us will spend

05:18.846 --> 05:20.915
the whole night straining
our necks looking sideways.

05:21.002 --> 05:22.720
I'm straining my neck
talking to you right now.

05:22.807 --> 05:23.907
Okay, so don't
look at me, Terry.

05:23.994 --> 05:25.592
Just face forward.
You see me every day.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.450
- Fine.
- Fine.

05:26.538 --> 05:28.117
I gotta say,
I'm surprised Gina

05:28.236 --> 05:30.725
invited us to drinks tonight.
She obviously only invited us

05:30.813 --> 05:32.413
over to her place
because she needed a favor.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.908
Why are you still
so down on her?

05:33.995 --> 05:35.009
I've been through
this before.

05:35.096 --> 05:37.572
In college, I had a football
buddy, Bryant Ungerbert...

05:37.660 --> 05:39.625
Oh, lemme guess.
You guys were best friends,

05:39.713 --> 05:41.381
then he got drafted
into the NFL,

05:41.469 --> 05:42.961
and now you never talk.
No, he got drafted into

05:43.048 --> 05:44.266
the Canadian football league,

05:44.354 --> 05:45.921
became a long snapper
for Ottawa,

05:46.009 --> 05:48.211
and even that level of
success ruined our friendship.

05:48.299 --> 05:50.008
He's still playing?
How is that possible?

05:50.096 --> 05:52.142
You're 35 to 60 years old.

05:52.231 --> 05:53.891
It's Canada.
They don't tackle as hard.

05:53.992 --> 05:56.641
Anyway, his career became
the only thing that mattered.

05:56.729 --> 05:58.389
He was off doing
photo shoots, commercials,

05:58.476 --> 06:00.325
speaking at long
snapping conventions...

06:00.413 --> 06:01.470
- Is that a thing?
- In Canada,

06:01.557 --> 06:03.289
it's like the Oscars.
Look, the point is

06:03.377 --> 06:05.109
he stopped making time
for his friends.

06:05.197 --> 06:06.765
Fine, but that's not
what's happening here.

06:06.852 --> 06:08.047
Nothing has changed
with Gina.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.445
- She's not an Ungerbert.
- Hi.

06:10.625 --> 06:13.117
So, Gina won't be able
to make it tonight.

06:13.205 --> 06:15.266
She doesn't have time.
But here are your credentials

06:15.354 --> 06:17.602
for tomorrow's event.
Have a great night.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.203
Oh, no.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.961
She is an Ungerbert.

06:23.889 --> 06:26.570
Hey, Gina's prepping inside.
You get some rest last night?

06:26.658 --> 06:27.508
Yeah,
because I got home

06:27.596 --> 06:30.383
from our 9:30 drinks at 9:41.
I was in bed by 10:00.

06:30.471 --> 06:31.782
Then I looked at my phone
for another two hours,

06:31.869 --> 06:33.087
so actually I didn't
sleep very well.

06:33.174 --> 06:34.320
But I did realize something.

06:34.408 --> 06:36.563
The only thing that
matters to Gina is work.

06:36.651 --> 06:38.734
You don't say?
Where have I heard that before?

06:38.822 --> 06:40.149
I don't know, Terry.
I don't have time for your

06:40.236 --> 06:42.102
- weird memory lapse.
- I said it last night.

06:42.190 --> 06:43.298
Well, I wish you
would've said it to me.

06:43.385 --> 06:45.477
Anyway, I decided I'm not
gonna let it go this time.

06:45.565 --> 06:46.720
After we update
her on the case,

06:46.807 --> 06:48.399
- I'm gonna say something to her.
- Good. I wish

06:48.486 --> 06:49.673
I'd have
said something to Ungerbert.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.493
Long snapper used to be
my favorite position.

06:51.580 --> 06:52.537
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.149
Hmm.
Well...

06:54.315 --> 06:55.492
you a weirdo.

06:55.886 --> 06:59.105
Timothée Chalamet,
shimmy-yah, shimmy-yay.

06:59.193 --> 07:02.065
Timothée Chalamet,
shimmy-yah, shimmy-yay.

07:02.153 --> 07:03.344
- Gina.
- Oh, sorry.

07:03.432 --> 07:04.858
- I'm doing my vocal warm-up.
- Great.

07:04.945 --> 07:06.492
Well, cyber looked into
the threats,

07:06.580 --> 07:08.220
and they traced
a number of negative comments

07:08.307 --> 07:10.711
back to another internet
celebrity, Marvin Lennox.

07:10.799 --> 07:12.610
Marvin Lennox. Yeah,
I'm not worried about him.

07:12.697 --> 07:15.477
- He's an inspirational baker.
- Inspirational baker?

07:15.565 --> 07:16.914
What the hell is that?

07:17.403 --> 07:20.047
<i>A man is like a quiche,
and a quiche is only</i>

07:20.135 --> 07:22.859
<i>as strong as its crust.
What's your crust?</i>

07:22.947 --> 07:24.945
Oh, that's exactly
what it sounds like.

07:25.033 --> 07:27.172
Yeah, he's not a threat.
He lives in Utah, and again,

07:27.260 --> 07:29.250
just to remind you...
Inspirational baker.

07:29.338 --> 07:31.253
Right. Well, even so,
we have metal detectors

07:31.341 --> 07:33.032
at all of the entrances,
and we'll keep our eyes peeled

07:33.119 --> 07:35.875
for anything suspicious.
Also, before we head in there,

07:35.963 --> 07:37.415
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

07:37.502 --> 07:39.234
- What's up?
- Well, it just kind of

07:39.322 --> 07:41.411
bummed me out that last night
you blew us off.

07:41.688 --> 07:43.016
For work. Again.

07:43.104 --> 07:45.672
What? Uh, no.
I did not miss drinks for work.

07:45.767 --> 07:48.093
I had food poisoning.
Did Janelle not tell you?

07:48.181 --> 07:49.797
- No.
- Wow, that's crazy.

07:49.885 --> 07:52.077
'Cause I specifically told her
to tell you... you know what?

07:52.164 --> 07:53.876
- I'm gonna fire her.
- You don't have to do that.

07:53.963 --> 07:55.406
- Janelle.
- Oh, God, doing it now?

07:55.494 --> 07:56.336
- Okay.
- Hi, Gina.

07:56.424 --> 07:58.352
O-kay. Sarge and I
should probably hit it,

07:58.440 --> 08:00.039
get back in there,
survey some people.

08:00.127 --> 08:01.008
But have a great show.

08:01.096 --> 08:02.564
Janelle, just remember
you're gonna have a lot of jobs

08:02.651 --> 08:04.046
in your life... this is but
a blip on your résumé.

08:04.133 --> 08:05.445
Okay Sarge, let's go.

08:06.118 --> 08:07.195
Wanted to see me, sir?

08:07.283 --> 08:08.963
Yes, I wanted to talk
to you about Nikolaj.

08:09.115 --> 08:11.281
How long have you known
he was a genius?

08:11.369 --> 08:13.000
I mean, I always
knew he was bright.

08:13.088 --> 08:14.656
I just never realized
he was that smart.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.529
Well, there's
no sugarcoating it.

08:16.617 --> 08:18.211
- You're a terrible father.
- What?!

08:18.299 --> 08:19.781
You've been asleep
at the wheel, man!

08:19.869 --> 08:22.352
What have you done to cultivate
his incredible mind?

08:22.440 --> 08:24.672
- I read to him every night.
- Shakespeare? Tolstoy?

08:24.760 --> 08:26.993
- No, nothing that advanced.
- Egads, are you reading him.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.125
Dickens?

08:28.221 --> 08:29.500
- Yes?
- Boyle!

08:29.601 --> 08:32.008
My father
never saw my potential.

08:32.096 --> 08:34.280
In grade school, I wanted
to spend all my free time

08:34.369 --> 08:38.111
drawing graphs and charts,
but he insisted I play basketball.

08:38.221 --> 08:40.515
As if I care about
slam dunking a three-pointer.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.523
Don't be my father, Boyle!

08:42.611 --> 08:44.451
I wouldn't dare!
What do you think I should do?

08:44.845 --> 08:47.914
Let me tutor Nikolaj.
Nothing too strenuous.

08:48.002 --> 08:50.859
Maybe some geometry,
statistical mechanics,

08:50.947 --> 08:53.711
perhaps some Latin lyric
poetry thrown in for fun.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.110
Oh, I don't know.
He's really booked.

08:55.197 --> 08:57.025
I guess I could cancel
his cartooning class,

08:57.113 --> 08:59.028
- but he really loves it.
- Don't do that.

08:59.116 --> 09:01.062
I hate to think of
all the great cartoons

09:01.150 --> 09:03.289
humanity missed out on
because Einstein

09:03.377 --> 09:05.750
was just too busy
reinventing physics.

09:05.838 --> 09:06.970
Okay, I'll cancel the class.

09:07.058 --> 09:08.886
I mean, who needs
relativity when we

09:08.974 --> 09:12.094
could've had Einstein's take
on lasagna-eating cats.

09:12.182 --> 09:14.010
- I said I'd cancel.
- Did he hate Mondays?

09:14.270 --> 09:15.641
We'll never know.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.234
Okay, I'm going, I'm going!

09:21.073 --> 09:23.163
Ugh, why won't this
dumb monitor turn on?

09:23.259 --> 09:24.999
Because you can't work
without your hands.

09:25.087 --> 09:26.789
Trust us.
If you could do this job

09:26.877 --> 09:29.024
without lifting a finger,
we would've already cracked it.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.500
Because we're lazy boys.

09:30.588 --> 09:31.859
I'm just not doing it
hard enough.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.599
Mmm!
Ooh!

09:33.922 --> 09:35.227
That's a double-sponger.

09:35.315 --> 09:36.375
All right.

09:36.463 --> 09:39.419
I am cleaning this up,
and no one is helping me.

09:39.507 --> 09:40.500
Not a problem.

09:40.588 --> 09:42.023
Because we're lazy boys.

09:48.203 --> 09:50.075
You gotta be kidding me!

09:52.274 --> 09:55.305
In the beginning,
there was nothing.

09:55.457 --> 09:58.945
And then God,
a woman, said,

09:59.070 --> 10:02.164
"Let there be Gina!"

10:05.568 --> 10:08.375
Gina!
Please look at me!

10:10.141 --> 10:11.142
You're welcome.

10:11.230 --> 10:12.970
Aaaaah!

10:13.249 --> 10:15.172
It's gonna be hard to spot
a crazy person in here.

10:15.259 --> 10:17.062
- They're all crazy.
- Tell me about it.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.344
This is more insane
than the crowd

10:18.431 --> 10:20.336
at the Carly Rae Jepson
I mean Slayer concert.

10:20.424 --> 10:21.687
G-Hive!

10:21.775 --> 10:25.421
Are you ready for
three new Gina-mandments?

10:25.819 --> 10:26.881
Number one.

10:26.969 --> 10:29.586
You can be anything
you set your mind to...

10:29.705 --> 10:32.621
as long as you're
already great at it!

10:32.721 --> 10:34.093
Number two.

10:34.212 --> 10:36.736
No one knows
you can't take it with you!

10:36.894 --> 10:39.679
Be buried with your money.

10:39.767 --> 10:41.171
Cha-ching!

10:41.353 --> 10:43.132
Number three.

10:43.383 --> 10:46.054
If you fall down nine times...

10:46.196 --> 10:47.787
you gotta reassess
your walking,

10:47.875 --> 10:49.671
'cause something's wrong.

10:49.862 --> 10:53.593
And now, I wanna hear
from you, my baby G-Hive!

10:53.681 --> 10:55.726
Yes, girl
in the mustard sweater.

10:55.814 --> 10:57.437
Hi, Gina.
I just quit my job

10:57.525 --> 11:00.086
and left my husband who loves
parkour more than he loves me.

11:00.174 --> 11:02.039
And it's all because
of your Gina-mendment:

11:02.127 --> 11:05.242
"If the light in your house
is dim, change the bulb."

11:05.330 --> 11:06.632
Yes!

11:06.720 --> 11:09.415
I have time for
15 more compliments.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.993
Hey, Jake.
I think Lennox is here.

11:11.112 --> 11:12.391
I see him.
You get him.

11:12.479 --> 11:13.415
I'll stick with Gina.

11:13.503 --> 11:14.891
Uh-oh.
He's moving.

11:14.986 --> 11:17.305
Moving up
Coming through.

11:18.021 --> 11:19.884
There's too many hoodies.
I lost him.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.290
Get Gina out of here, now!
And now the time has come

11:22.378 --> 11:23.907
for ya'll to meditate.

11:23.995 --> 11:26.345
Close your eyes
while I sing to you.

11:26.433 --> 11:28.915
♪ Breathe in, breathe out

11:29.003 --> 11:31.727
♪ I invented meditation ♪

11:31.815 --> 11:33.397
R...
Gina, we gotta go.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.360
- Lennox is here.
- Told you I'm not

11:34.448 --> 11:36.125
- worried about Lennox.
- Well, it's not your call.

11:36.212 --> 11:38.352
- We're leaving.
- Jake, you're overreacting.

11:42.096 --> 11:44.565
On second thought, maybe we
should get out of here.

11:46.681 --> 11:49.292
- Okay. Kitchen's all clear.
- Bedroom's clear.

11:49.380 --> 11:50.916
Can't believe
I just escaped death!

11:51.004 --> 11:52.237
I haven't felt
this alive since

11:52.325 --> 11:53.936
I almost got killed by
that bus.

11:54.024 --> 11:55.237
- I know, right?
- What a rush.

11:55.325 --> 11:57.627
Feel just like Kevin Costner
in "The Bodyguard"!

11:57.715 --> 11:59.862
What? If anyone's
like Kevin Costner it's me.

11:59.963 --> 12:01.041
I'm the one carrying Gina!

12:01.129 --> 12:03.643
Well, I think we can agree
we were both Kevin Costner.

12:03.918 --> 12:05.760
- No!
- Jake, that was so dope

12:05.848 --> 12:07.399
when you were like,
"Clear a path!"

12:07.487 --> 12:08.909
Guys, uniformed officers

12:08.997 --> 12:11.346
found Marvin hiding in
a bathroom at the event space.

12:11.434 --> 12:12.705
He's in custody.
We got him!

12:12.793 --> 12:14.705
That's great!
I hope they give him the chair.

12:14.793 --> 12:17.401
Ooh, we should celebrate.
Champagne's in the fridge.

12:17.489 --> 12:18.489
On it.

12:20.814 --> 12:23.401
Duncan, I almost died.
It was amazing.

12:23.489 --> 12:25.926
<i>I heard all about it, Gines.
Look, you're trending!</i>

12:26.014 --> 12:28.026
And from my pain
comes triumph!

12:28.114 --> 12:30.029
<i>Love that.
And we can use this publicity</i>

12:30.117 --> 12:32.096
<i>to get more money out of
those bottled water guys.</i>

12:32.184 --> 12:33.972
<i>You really impressed them
at drinks last night!</i>

12:34.059 --> 12:36.113
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah...
we should talk about this later.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.713
<i>Sorry, you're breaking up.
Look, I said they loved you</i>

12:38.801 --> 12:40.630
<i>at the drinks last night...
The drinks last night</i>

12:40.717 --> 12:42.050
<i>that you had with
the water people?</i>

12:42.137 --> 12:44.596
<i>Crap, I just hit
the Holland Tunnel, but again,</i>

12:44.684 --> 12:46.510
<i>great job
with the drinks last night!</i>

12:46.598 --> 12:47.784
<i>Bye.</i>

12:48.849 --> 12:49.939
Jake, did you hear that?

12:50.027 --> 12:52.119
I did, and there's
been a change of plans.

12:52.207 --> 12:54.383
I'm gonna take a rain
check on the champagne,

12:54.471 --> 12:56.104
but it was wonderful
seeing you.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.847
Why are you talking
like a flight attendant?

12:57.934 --> 13:00.479
This is how I always talk
when everything is okay.

13:00.567 --> 13:02.073
Which it is right now.

13:02.161 --> 13:03.885
Please enjoy
the rest of your day.

13:05.441 --> 13:07.659
How did Nikolaj do?
Were you able to overcome

13:07.747 --> 13:09.985
- my horrible parenting?
- No, it's far worse

13:10.073 --> 13:11.330
than I could've ever imagined.

13:11.418 --> 13:13.152
I showed him a periodic
table, and he thought

13:13.239 --> 13:14.836
it was a coloring book
illustration.

13:14.924 --> 13:15.932
I blame myself.

13:16.020 --> 13:18.549
It's such a classic Boyle trait
not to recognize talent.

13:18.649 --> 13:21.659
My cousin Susan didn't know
she could sing until her late 40s.

13:21.747 --> 13:23.620
Honestly, given the hole
that you've put him in,

13:23.707 --> 13:25.796
he needs more expert
help than I can provide.

13:25.884 --> 13:27.385
But, there is...

13:27.560 --> 13:29.471
a boarding school
in Switzerland that would be

13:29.559 --> 13:31.846
a perfect fit for him.
He can enroll immediately.

13:31.934 --> 13:33.713
In Switzerland?
I'd never see him.

13:33.801 --> 13:35.566
Then uproot your life
and move there with him.

13:35.653 --> 13:36.741
No one here would miss you.

13:36.829 --> 13:38.244
Hmm.
We could live in Gruyere,

13:38.332 --> 13:39.522
the fondue capital
of the world.

13:39.609 --> 13:41.705
Oh, I don't know.
It's such a big change.

13:41.793 --> 13:42.698
Well, he's the genius.

13:42.786 --> 13:44.238
Why don't we ask him
what he wants to do?

13:44.325 --> 13:45.541
Good point.

13:45.629 --> 13:47.127
Niko?
We need to talk.

13:47.854 --> 13:49.908
Wait.
Why is he writing the solution

13:49.996 --> 13:51.385
to my formula for no reason?

13:51.473 --> 13:54.128
And why is he drawing
colorful underpants beneath it?

13:54.216 --> 13:57.263
Oh, I see what's happening.
He's drawing Boy Riga,

13:57.351 --> 13:59.862
loyal sidekick to his favorite
superhero, Captain Latvia.

13:59.950 --> 14:02.119
That's his symbol.
He distributes grain evenly

14:02.207 --> 14:03.690
among the working class.

14:04.113 --> 14:05.869
Uh-huh. I see.

14:05.971 --> 14:08.674
So this was all just
some coincidence.

14:08.771 --> 14:11.066
He wasn't writing
the absolute value of psi.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.852
He was just...

14:13.361 --> 14:14.463
doodling.

14:19.781 --> 14:20.782
Aaaah!

14:23.045 --> 14:24.725
Raaah! Uhhh! Ahhh!

14:25.998 --> 14:28.287
Rosa?
Are you stuck in there?

14:28.375 --> 14:29.537
No, I'm in here by choice.

14:29.625 --> 14:32.295
Oh, 'cause I hear
some banging noises

14:32.383 --> 14:35.022
as if someone was struggling
to open the door.

14:35.110 --> 14:36.336
No.
That was the pipes.

14:36.431 --> 14:38.391
Or, is it the sound of you

14:38.479 --> 14:40.046
learning how to ask for help?

14:40.134 --> 14:41.353
You know, you can't spell

14:41.441 --> 14:43.781
"independent"
without "dependant."

14:43.869 --> 14:45.453
And you can't spell
"Go ♪♪♪♪ yourself"

14:45.541 --> 14:47.141
without ♪♪♪♪ "you".

14:48.192 --> 14:49.649
Jake, I had a work thing.

14:49.737 --> 14:51.603
I can't believe you're being
such a baby about this.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.070
I'm not being a baby.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.438
Look, I'm sorry I lied, okay?

14:54.526 --> 14:56.024
It was a big
opportunity for me.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.898
I was having drinks with
the brand director of

14:57.985 --> 14:59.766
a bottled water company.

14:59.854 --> 15:03.102
I can't say which one, but it
rhymes with, "fart water."

15:03.190 --> 15:05.369
Perhaps one day
I will laugh at that.

15:05.457 --> 15:08.008
In the meantime, I'm happy
for all your success.

15:08.096 --> 15:10.883
I hope your partnership with
"fart water" is very fruitful.

15:10.971 --> 15:12.156
- Good day.
- Come on, dude.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.053
- Just talk to me.
- I would if we were friends,

15:14.140 --> 15:14.930
but you're making it
it very clear

15:15.018 --> 15:16.477
that we are not,
so I shan't.

15:16.565 --> 15:18.656
- Oh, you're shanting me?
- Yeah, that's right.

15:18.833 --> 15:19.953
- Jake!
- Can't hear you.

15:20.041 --> 15:21.406
- You're shanted!
- Jake!

15:21.558 --> 15:23.406
I told you I only
talk to my friends.

15:23.494 --> 15:24.188
No, Jake.

15:24.276 --> 15:26.242
I think I just got stabbed
by that guy.

15:26.333 --> 15:28.422
Oh, yeah, ya did.

15:28.744 --> 15:30.360
Ya definitely did.

15:31.199 --> 15:33.938
Okay! The ambulance is on its way.
They said not to

15:34.026 --> 15:34.922
remove the knife.
Great.

15:35.010 --> 15:36.240
What's up?
I got your text...

15:36.328 --> 15:38.930
Oh, my God, Gina,
there's a knife in you!

15:39.018 --> 15:40.367
Jake, did you stab Gina?

15:40.455 --> 15:42.914
I didn't stab Gina, okay?
Lennox wasn't our guy.

15:43.002 --> 15:44.649
The real perp did it.
He's in a black hoodie

15:44.736 --> 15:45.781
and jeans.
He ran that way.

15:45.869 --> 15:47.522
- I'm on it.
- I want you to stay calm

15:47.610 --> 15:49.134
and just try to keep
all of your blood

15:49.222 --> 15:50.790
- inside your body.
- Bitch, what do you think

15:50.877 --> 15:52.017
- I'm doing?
- Yeah, I don't know

15:52.104 --> 15:53.868
- why I said that.
- Bring your ass down here so

15:53.955 --> 15:56.938
- we can finish our conversation.
- We can do that later, Gina.

15:57.026 --> 15:59.273
First of all, I have
so much adrenaline pumping

15:59.361 --> 16:01.306
through my body right now
I can feel almost nothing.

16:01.393 --> 16:02.883
Secondly,
you can't say no to me.

16:02.971 --> 16:04.423
- I have a knife in my back.
- Yeah, that tracks.

16:04.510 --> 16:06.250
Okay, fine.
So I was saying that

16:06.338 --> 16:09.453
ever since you left you've
been kind of a crappy friend.

16:10.117 --> 16:11.531
Brrrrrawwwwwwoo.

16:11.619 --> 16:13.491
We're definitely not having
this conversation right now.

16:13.578 --> 16:15.570
No, it's okay.
It just hurt for a sec.

16:15.658 --> 16:17.703
Come on, let's do it.
Ugh.

16:17.791 --> 16:19.430
All right, fine,
what was I saying?

16:19.518 --> 16:22.938
You were saying that I'm a...
Ahh, bad friend.

16:23.637 --> 16:25.750
Right.
You're a bad friend.

16:25.838 --> 16:27.164
That's what
I was saying to you.

16:27.252 --> 16:29.344
- Yeah.
- And just that, you know,

16:29.432 --> 16:31.174
you've been really blowing me
off for the last few months,

16:31.261 --> 16:33.195
and last night you
lied to me about being sick.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.024
That really sucked.
All right, well, listen.

16:35.126 --> 16:36.823
I'm sorry I lied, Jake.

16:36.911 --> 16:39.625
I saw you were getting upset
and I didn't want to hurt you.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.907
But I don't know what to say
about the other stuff because

16:41.994 --> 16:44.984
this is my life and I don't
want to apologize for that.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.656
No, and Gina,
you shouldn't have to.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.234
Look, I'm really proud of you.
You're totally killing it.

16:49.322 --> 16:50.891
Yeah,
people want to stab me.

16:50.979 --> 16:52.103
I mean, that's
a very positive way of

16:52.190 --> 16:53.888
- looking at things, but yeah.
- Thank you.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.828
Ha ha ha ha-ha!
Hoo hoo!

16:56.916 --> 16:58.797
♪ I hit a new level of pain ♪

16:58.886 --> 17:01.008
♪ Please keep talkin',
please keep talkin'! ♪

17:01.096 --> 17:02.547
Okay, look.
I just wanted you

17:02.635 --> 17:03.679
to know that I miss you.

17:03.767 --> 17:04.977
Well, I miss you too dude.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.922
Great, so can we agree to
see each other like 5% more?

17:08.010 --> 17:09.344
Deal. Aah!

17:10.938 --> 17:12.867
- We're not going to shake on it.
- Yeah, we'll just take

17:12.954 --> 17:13.961
each other at our word.

17:14.049 --> 17:16.547
Oooh!
That's a knife!

17:16.635 --> 17:19.758
That is a knife in my back.
That's so weird to say.

17:19.846 --> 17:22.078
There's a knife in my back.

17:22.798 --> 17:24.422
Boyle, may I speak
with you for a minute?

17:24.510 --> 17:25.623
Sure, I was just googling

17:25.711 --> 17:27.256
"good toys
for normal children."

17:27.344 --> 17:30.164
Nikolaj may not be a genius,
but he's a very bright child.

17:30.252 --> 17:31.732
And on top of that,
you were right.

17:31.820 --> 17:33.633
He's also a very gifted
artist.

17:33.721 --> 17:35.344
Look what he did
to my periodic table.

17:35.590 --> 17:38.114
Sure, it's a bit
derivative of Kandinsky,

17:38.202 --> 17:40.227
but the palette shows
an impressive comprehension

17:40.315 --> 17:42.617
- of color theory.
- And he's good at clouds, too.

17:43.102 --> 17:44.125
Okay.

17:44.213 --> 17:46.750
I also wanted to say
I was wrong to imply

17:46.838 --> 17:48.314
that you didn't know
what was best for him.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.117
Oh.

17:49.205 --> 17:51.047
You're an exceptionally
supportive parent,

17:51.135 --> 17:53.383
and I wish my father
had been more like you.

17:55.172 --> 17:56.609
Thank you for saying that.

17:56.906 --> 17:57.999
And sir,

17:58.107 --> 18:01.352
nothing would make me prouder
than being your big daddy.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.430
Well, we're off track now.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.039
So, uh, good day.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.281
Hey, guys.

18:08.064 --> 18:09.586
How you feeling, Gina?

18:09.674 --> 18:10.976
Sometimes I feel like a nut,

18:11.064 --> 18:12.266
sometimes I don't.

18:12.354 --> 18:14.000
Almond Joy's got nuts.

18:14.088 --> 18:15.523
Mounds don't.

18:15.611 --> 18:17.202
She's very hopped up
on painkillers.

18:17.290 --> 18:18.945
Hold up, when did you learn
French,

18:19.033 --> 18:20.251
Monsieur L'baguette?

18:20.339 --> 18:21.602
Oh, as a bébé.

18:21.690 --> 18:24.375
Oh, oui!
Oui, oui, oui, oui.

18:24.463 --> 18:26.883
It actually helps to
play along, I'm assuming.

18:27.021 --> 18:28.545
So what's the latest?
Did you catch the perp?

18:28.632 --> 18:30.031
No. I almost had him.

18:30.128 --> 18:32.827
But then he jumped up, grabbed
a flagpole, spun around it

18:32.915 --> 18:35.092
like Spider-Man, and then
flipped out of sight on a roof.

18:35.179 --> 18:37.586
It was crazy. Officers
are still patrolling the area.

18:37.674 --> 18:38.859
Oh, my God, that's it.

18:38.947 --> 18:40.148
That is it!
The treasure is

18:40.236 --> 18:41.930
in the Forest of
Enchanted Secrets!

18:42.018 --> 18:43.836
- Let's go!
- No, we can't.

18:43.924 --> 18:46.203
We have to stay here and
guard the Amulet of Destiny.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.836
True dat, true dat.

18:47.924 --> 18:50.211
Sarge, call me crazy,
but it almost sounds like

18:50.299 --> 18:52.070
whoever stabbed Gina
knew parkour...

18:52.187 --> 18:55.055
Just like the ex-husband of
that lady from Gina's event.

18:55.143 --> 18:56.742
Right!
Gina convinced her to leave him

18:56.830 --> 18:58.024
and he probably wants revenge.

18:58.111 --> 18:59.500
- I'll look into it.
- Okay.

18:59.976 --> 19:02.523
Jake, I cannot wait
for this doctor.

19:02.611 --> 19:04.539
Will you please grab
this knife out of my back?

19:04.627 --> 19:06.156
- Get it!
- Gina, it's already out.

19:06.244 --> 19:07.375
What?

19:17.512 --> 19:18.543
- Hello?
- <i>You win.</i>

19:18.631 --> 19:20.019
- <i>Please help me.</i>
- No.

19:20.107 --> 19:21.472
What, why?
I learned my lesson.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.160
- You were right.
- No, you were right.

19:23.248 --> 19:25.386
For the past four hours,
I've been watching you

19:25.474 --> 19:26.816
on the security camera.

19:27.553 --> 19:28.816
You have?
That's weird.

19:28.904 --> 19:30.559
- This isn't about me.
- Still seems weird.

19:30.646 --> 19:32.605
Rosa!
Watching you try to open

19:32.693 --> 19:35.066
that door and fail again

19:35.154 --> 19:37.640
and again
and again and again

19:37.756 --> 19:38.932
was inspiring!

19:39.020 --> 19:40.543
I was trying to teach you
a lesson,

19:40.631 --> 19:43.066
and instead,
you taught me a lesson.

19:43.154 --> 19:44.504
Great. What lesson is that?

19:44.592 --> 19:48.033
There is nothing the human
spirit cannot overcome.

19:48.121 --> 19:50.924
So Rosa Diaz,
you are not quitting.

19:51.011 --> 19:52.840
You are gonna open
that door because

19:52.941 --> 19:56.321
you are badass and you don't
need help from anyone!

19:56.408 --> 19:58.785
Yeah. I'm Rosa Diaz.

20:01.394 --> 20:03.191
You can do this, Rosa!

20:06.025 --> 20:08.001
Uhhhhh!

20:08.089 --> 20:09.509
She's doing it!

20:11.945 --> 20:14.513
Uhhhhhh!

20:14.600 --> 20:16.297
Yes!

20:16.384 --> 20:18.299
Uhhhhh!

20:21.898 --> 20:23.524
- You did it!
- I did it!

20:23.612 --> 20:25.977
Oh, that was great!
I love being independent!

20:26.829 --> 20:29.250
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Oh, okay, I'll help you.

20:29.443 --> 20:31.727
And then you were like,
"We can use the Amulet

20:31.834 --> 20:33.164
to fight
the Queen of Tears!"

20:33.258 --> 20:35.743
I said all of that when I was
on drugs? That's brilliant.

20:35.831 --> 20:38.118
Yeah, we basically came up
with an entire amazing story.

20:38.206 --> 20:39.586
- We should write a movie!
- Yes!

20:39.674 --> 20:41.321
Jake and Gina present,
colon,

20:41.409 --> 20:42.789
"The Queen of Tears,"
colon,

20:42.877 --> 20:44.205
"Battle for the
Amulet of Destiny."

20:44.292 --> 20:46.608
Colon, Part One,
colon, of Five.

20:46.696 --> 20:48.756
Oh, get those
sequel profits... smart.

20:48.844 --> 20:50.545
- Yerp.
- Oh, here comes Terry.

20:50.633 --> 20:52.392
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Oh, you should be, Terrance.

20:52.479 --> 20:54.360
You almost missed
the surprise we got for you.

20:54.448 --> 20:56.086
- Huh, what is it?
- I think you mean,

20:56.211 --> 20:57.948
"Who is it?"

20:59.663 --> 21:01.381
Bryant Ungerbert?

21:01.469 --> 21:02.571
Hello, Terry Jeffords.

21:02.659 --> 21:04.969
It's been far too long,
old friend.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.539
Uhh! We did the right thing.

21:08.627 --> 21:10.655
- Yes we did, Gina.
- Who's Gina?

21:10.743 --> 21:11.875
Are you still on drugs?

21:11.969 --> 21:14.296
- Yeeeah.
- Oh, tight.
