[theme music playing]

00:28.270 --> 00:30.522
[soft rock song plays]

00:30.610 --> 00:34.068
[Courtney] What's the truth? What's true?

00:35.860 --> 00:38.067
I just think about you

00:39.870 --> 00:43.283
Got me wondering
Why we never tried again...

00:43.370 --> 00:45.668
I think we each have our own truth.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.496
So let me get this straight.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.579
[Hannah] Okay.

00:51.670 --> 00:53.046
You don't know why you're here.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.217
You don't know how I'm supposed to feel.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.961
You don't know why I haven't seen you

00:57.050 --> 00:59.427
and have tried not to think about you
for months

00:59.510 --> 01:01.808
and then you show up tonight.

01:02.890 --> 01:04.471
Precise and accurate,

01:04.980 --> 01:06.845
in true Clay Jensen style.

01:06.940 --> 01:11.388
-You're still allowed to make fun of me.
-Allowed? Obligated? Who can say?

01:12.360 --> 01:13.179
Are you real?

01:14.030 --> 01:14.849
Do you see me?

01:15.320 --> 01:16.446
Are you corporeal?

01:16.530 --> 01:18.407
_That seems like _
a scnence-flctlon question.

01:18.740 --> 01:21.072
-Can I touch you?
-That seems like a loaded question.

01:24.040 --> 01:27.032
This is fucked up, right?
[stammers] Like, I'm seriously fucked up.

01:27.710 --> 01:31.874
I don't think you're fucked up.
You're just... working through things.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.163
-Things like seeing a ghost?
-And other things.

01:38.430 --> 01:39.385
So you are a ghost.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.926
Okay, does it matter what you call me?
I'm here.

01:43.390 --> 01:46.177
-And you're here for a reason?
-I would think so.

01:47.390 --> 01:50.473
-But you don't know what it is.
-I was hoping you would.

01:51.270 --> 01:53.647
-And you're not going away.
-I don't think so.

01:53.730 --> 01:54.936
I mean, not for the moment.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.190
[scoffs]

02:01.120 --> 02:02.576
Well, that's just fucking great.

02:09.210 --> 02:11.417
-[Lainie] Clay!
-[knocking on door]

02:11.500 --> 02:12.410
Clay!

02:12.960 --> 02:14.166
You're going to be late.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.546
Shit.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.506
-Clay?
-[knocking continues]

02:20.720 --> 02:21.880
Are you all right?

02:23.810 --> 02:26.301
Uh, sorry! I'm fine.
I'm fine. I overslept.

02:28.640 --> 02:29.470
[sighs]

02:30.440 --> 02:34.763
-You slept in your clothes?
-Yeah. Homework and stuff.

02:34.860 --> 02:38.694
-But, um, everything's okay?
-Yeah, all good.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.520
How was court yesterday?

02:43.580 --> 02:44.399
[scoffs]

02:44.870 --> 02:46.110
Why don't you tell me?

02:46.330 --> 02:50.243
I was just there to drop off some files.
How about you?

02:51.040 --> 02:51.870
I was just curious.

02:53.210 --> 02:55.747
Clay, I know you said
you don't think about Hannah,

02:55.840 --> 03:00.834
that you don't care about her anymore,
but I am worried that that's not true.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.795
Gotta get dressed for school.

03:06.180 --> 03:07.010
Well...

03:07.770 --> 03:09.385
-Okay.
-Okay.

03:09.930 --> 03:10.760
Bye.

03:12.770 --> 03:16.228
-Nothing's going on?
-I have to go to school.

03:17.070 --> 03:20.278
-And you don't care about me anymore?
-Look, I tried, Hannah.

03:20.490 --> 03:22.981
I did everything I could for you,
and nothing worked.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.439
Nothing.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.112
And now you're back?
And there's still nothing I can do.

03:28.910 --> 03:30.866
If that's true, why am I here?

03:32.620 --> 03:34.121
Yeah. Exactly.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.330
[phone beeps]

03:39.840 --> 03:40.659
What the hell?

03:46.720 --> 03:48.130
Shit. I gotta go.

03:54.270 --> 03:55.089
[sighs]

04:04.860 --> 04:08.409
"Hannah wasn't the only one."
What do you suppose that means?

04:13.290 --> 04:14.279
Who gave it to you?

04:15.170 --> 04:17.661
And why now, the day my trial started?

04:20.760 --> 04:23.581
-You think they're connected?
-You think they're not?

04:24.090 --> 04:25.671
[horn honks]

04:28.010 --> 04:32.014
I think that I need to get dressed,
and go to school,

04:32.100 --> 04:33.226
and try to live my life.

04:37.900 --> 04:38.719
[sighs]

04:52.910 --> 04:54.070
[Slqe] Saddle up, partner.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.701
Did we talk about you giving me a ride?

04:58.790 --> 04:59.916
Did we have to?

05:01.340 --> 05:02.659
I mean, no, but, um...

05:04.420 --> 05:05.967
Should we talk about last night?

05:06.050 --> 05:08.211
How about instead of talking,
we just ride?

05:16.940 --> 05:18.680
[Courtney]
We all have things we keep hidden.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.277
Sometimes, keeping secrets
is how you survive.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.396
[motor rewing]

05:25.490 --> 05:27.481
[pop music playing]

05:32.330 --> 05:33.479
Because in high school,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.037
-one rumor, one picture...
-Yes.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.169
...one incident, can define you forever.

05:45.380 --> 05:46.961
You're doing the right thing, honey.

05:48.590 --> 05:49.500
I know.

05:50.550 --> 05:54.384
Now it's gonna be out there.
Everything I said in my deposition.

05:54.680 --> 05:58.684
Look, what happened to Hannah
after that photo, it happened to you, too.

05:58.770 --> 05:59.896
And that is not your fault.

06:00.150 --> 06:04.109
You told the truth. And that's all
you're gonna do again today.

06:04.650 --> 06:05.480
[phone beeps]

06:08.650 --> 06:10.311
-[Steve] Is that Mikey?
-Uh... [sighs]

06:11.200 --> 06:12.861
Aww. Todd, look.

06:12.950 --> 06:16.078
Wow. Wow, he is a keeper, huh?

06:17.160 --> 06:18.286
I guess he is.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.571
[Courtney]
And the truth doesn't even matter.

06:23.710 --> 06:24.870
Barry e-mailed me last night.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.713
He said it was Bryce's idea,
that Bryce asked you yesterday.

06:28.050 --> 06:28.869
Asked me what?

06:29.470 --> 06:31.131
If we want to use their lavwer.

06:31.430 --> 06:34.558
I'm not gonna let you take the stand
without some guidance.

06:34.640 --> 06:38.269
This kind of thing can ruin
somebody's life, even if they're innocent.

06:38.350 --> 06:41.228
I know, it's just--
we can find our own lawyer. It's fine.

06:41.310 --> 06:43.642
This is the kind of thing
your father used to handle.

06:43.980 --> 06:47.859
At times like these, we need to benefit
from our associations.

06:48.610 --> 06:50.601
[phone vibrates]

06:51.910 --> 06:53.525
-Who is it?
-It's, uh...

06:54.410 --> 06:55.900
Bryce, actually.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.492
He probably wants to get
some throws in before practice.

06:58.580 --> 07:01.367
-I should go.
-Okay, honey. And tell him thanks.

07:03.420 --> 07:05.832
-No, I wanna testify.
-[Greg] But...?

07:06.920 --> 07:08.456
[sighs] It's just...

07:10.590 --> 07:13.047
Tyler Down, who testified yesterday,

07:13.760 --> 07:15.808
called out a couple kids,
and they weren't happy.

07:16.930 --> 07:17.760
That's all.

07:19.600 --> 07:23.593
Well, if anybody gives you any flack,
you tell me, and I'll handle it.

07:24.610 --> 07:25.429
[chuckles]

07:26.190 --> 07:27.009
Thanks, Dad.

07:29.900 --> 07:33.609
[Courtney] When rumors spread,
you can fight them or ignore them,

07:33.700 --> 07:35.520
but they never really go away.

07:36.740 --> 07:38.037
When you're the target,

07:38.450 --> 07:40.782
you do anything you can
to protect yourself.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.611
[tape ripping]

07:47.590 --> 07:49.160
Jess! Hey! You wanna help?

07:49.800 --> 07:50.789
[Bryce] Babe.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.080
Where else you want 'em?

07:56.100 --> 08:00.059
[chuckles] You guys are ridiculous,
but sweet.

08:00.140 --> 08:02.597
Babe, thank you for helping me with this.

08:02.850 --> 08:03.680
Come here.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.311
[Courtney] Sometimes you hide.

08:09.730 --> 08:11.027
Sometimes you fight back.

08:14.950 --> 08:16.269
Anything you have to do.

08:19.620 --> 08:20.530
[Alex] There you go.

08:22.750 --> 08:23.739
Thank you.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.956
-Good for you. Let's go.
-[both grunt]

08:30.340 --> 08:31.329
Such a gentleman.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.928
This doesn't mean I'm gonna put out
or anything.

08:34.010 --> 08:35.921
What? Not even a handy?

08:36.010 --> 08:38.547
-Oh, my hand doesn't really work...
-All right.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.477
Hey, you know what?
Let's take the side entrance today.

08:44.560 --> 08:47.802
-But it's way further, and I get tired.
-I can carry you. Come on.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.856
Okay, you're not-- Dude, you're not--

08:49.940 --> 08:52.431
The whole reason I called you
was to avoid another scene.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.902
Getting picked up by my dad in the cop car
was embarrassing enough.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.196
[Courtney]
Because the thing is, in high school,

09:03.370 --> 09:05.156
everyone's watching you, all the time.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.376
You have to be careful.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.458
[Kevin] Get my note?

09:24.480 --> 09:27.472
About dropping by the office?
I was hoping that we could chat.

09:27.770 --> 09:31.103
-About what?
-About anything that you need.

09:31.770 --> 09:34.819
Anything I can do to help
with what you're going through.

09:35.110 --> 09:38.443
Really? You think you can be helpful
all of a sudden?

09:40.240 --> 09:41.901
Yes, uh, I think I can.

09:43.290 --> 09:47.249
Look, I know what you think about me,
you know, and about what happened,

09:48.870 --> 09:51.282
but the most important thing to me
right now, Jessica,

09:52.000 --> 09:53.160
is about keeping you safe.

09:55.380 --> 09:56.210
[girl] Jessica!

09:56.760 --> 09:59.046
Hey, where you been?
We still gotta celebrate, girl.

10:00.220 --> 10:02.552
Uh, the squad made Jess a flyer yesterday.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.552
-Wow, congratulations, Ms. Davis.
-Thank you.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.511
-Think about what I said, okay?
-Yeah.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.527
Asshole. You're welcome.

10:15.570 --> 10:16.525
Do I know you?

10:17.280 --> 10:18.315
Uh... [chuckles]

10:18.400 --> 10:21.278
Nina Jones.
And trust me, Porter's clueless.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.827
It's better to keep your mouth shut
around him.

10:29.290 --> 10:31.997
[Courtney] You have to protect yourself
any way you can.

10:32.630 --> 10:33.585
So that's what I did.

10:34.550 --> 10:37.508
-What's going on? Who are these people?
-They're all here for you.

10:38.670 --> 10:42.595
My e-mail list of concerned moms
has over a thousand names in this county.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.671
And moms do love a good craft project.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.978
That's... That's her school picture.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.470
[Jackie] Doesn't she look lovely?

10:54.690 --> 10:56.396
We're putting a face on this trial.

11:04.160 --> 11:08.039
She told me that her foundation wanted
to provide whatever support I needed.

11:08.120 --> 11:11.453
-But she didn't specify a picket line.
-No.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.876
You have to be careful, okay?

11:15.090 --> 11:19.129
These pyrotechnics can be useful,
but don't forget this is still your show.

11:20.630 --> 11:22.757
-I know that.
-And she's staying with you?

11:23.720 --> 11:25.005
Well, I have a spare room.

11:25.930 --> 11:27.841
Dennis, the house is empty. It is--

11:27.930 --> 11:30.262
There's no reason for her
to pay for a hotel room.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.472
Just... be careful.

11:35.480 --> 11:38.779
[Courtney] I spread a rumor about Hannah
and I'm not proud of it.

11:39.150 --> 11:41.983
[Dennis] And what happened
after you spread that rumor?

11:43.280 --> 11:45.487
Boys asked me and Hannah
to have sex with them.

11:46.370 --> 11:49.692
Or got physical. And they were aggressive.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.906
[scoffs] And I couldn't handle it.

11:53.290 --> 11:57.033
This was just a meaningless kiss.
All right? Girls do it all the time.

11:57.130 --> 12:00.793
And what to your direct knowledge
did the school do

12:01.590 --> 12:04.002
in response to Hannah
being sexually harassed?

12:04.090 --> 12:07.139
Or the fact that a lewd photo
of two students

12:07.220 --> 12:09.051
was being shared on campus?

12:10.770 --> 12:11.589
Nothing.

12:13.020 --> 12:14.260
The school did nothing.

12:18.770 --> 12:19.816
[Clay] Who did this?

12:22.240 --> 12:24.481
Someone I talked about yesterday,
I'm guessing.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.070
At the trial.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.116
This is what happens
when you tell the truth.

12:39.750 --> 12:40.580
Ask him.

12:42.420 --> 12:46.333
Did you just come here to look
at the destruction that is my life, or...?

12:46.760 --> 12:48.546
No. I was wondering, do you ever...

12:49.930 --> 12:51.215
work with Polaroids?

12:52.770 --> 12:54.260
Amateur hipster tripe.

12:55.770 --> 12:59.604
-I'll take that as a no.
-It's retro analog bullshit.

13:00.070 --> 13:03.187
-There's no negatives, what's the point?
-Unless that is the point.

13:03.690 --> 13:05.146
So no one can make a copy?

13:05.610 --> 13:08.943
No, you can make a copy of anything,
you just take a digital picture of it.

13:10.530 --> 13:13.579
But, yeah, you want one print
to hold on to, take a Polaroid.

13:15.580 --> 13:16.740
Do you know these people?

13:18.290 --> 13:20.087
Tommy Shuster, Erica...

13:20.710 --> 13:23.417
Charles, I think.
I shot Tommy a few times for baseball.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.007
-So they go here?
-They did.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.426
They were seniors when we were freshmen.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.556
Do you think he knew Scott Reed?

13:33.970 --> 13:36.689
Don't all those troglodytes know
each other? Why do you care?

13:40.020 --> 13:41.146
I'm not sure I do.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.390
Only have a second, coach.
I got a class waiting.

13:47.490 --> 13:48.309
What's up?

13:48.410 --> 13:52.733
Well, I understand you had a little chat
with one of my players yesterday.

13:53.660 --> 13:56.288
I'd appreciate it
if you'd come see me first next time.

13:56.370 --> 13:58.747
Okay, well, it's my job
to have a chat with students.

13:58.830 --> 14:01.879
I can't be coming to you every time
one of them happens to play baseball.

14:01.960 --> 14:02.949
No, sure, sure.

14:04.050 --> 14:06.837
Look, I'm glad we're working on awareness,

14:06.920 --> 14:10.469
and educating these kids about consent,
and everything you're doing. It's great.

14:11.510 --> 14:13.250
I'm just looking for a little teamwork.

14:14.180 --> 14:15.340
I give the right speeches,

14:16.020 --> 14:19.012
give me a heads up if you've got
a concern about one of my guys.

14:19.100 --> 14:23.639
Okay. I got a concern
about all your guys. Heads up.

14:25.070 --> 14:28.813
You know what, I'm sick of athletes
always being the targets.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.192
Coach. Athletes have the run
of this school, and you know it.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.191
I just don't want them to run kids over.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.827
You want teamwork?
Check your boys, so I don't have to.

14:40.370 --> 14:44.033
We've been talking about
how do you control your impulses.

14:44.550 --> 14:48.668
Today we're going to do an exercise
that will help you think before you act.

14:49.340 --> 14:52.138
Because you're gonna do the thinking
for someone else.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.302
You're gonna be someone else's eyes
and their ears,

14:55.890 --> 14:57.380
and guide them around the room.

14:57.850 --> 15:01.149
-Or out of a window.
-Maybe, Cyrus.

15:01.850 --> 15:04.683
[scoffs] But you'll be
switching blindfolds halfway through,

15:04.770 --> 15:06.647
so don't do anything
you don't want done to you.

15:07.860 --> 15:08.679
Okay?

15:09.650 --> 15:11.356
That means find a partner.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.611
Or I'll find one for you.

15:14.740 --> 15:17.573
You'd think they'd run these class names
by a focus group first.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.742
"Ass Class." You're a pretty good artist.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.042
Kind words from the master photographer.

15:33.180 --> 15:34.135
That was you, right?

15:35.260 --> 15:37.558
You won that photo contest
with that night vision picture

15:37.640 --> 15:38.846
of the dog pissing last year?

15:41.190 --> 15:42.088
Punk rock, dude.

15:46.770 --> 15:47.600
Should we...?

15:50.860 --> 15:51.849
Why the hell not?

15:53.820 --> 15:54.650
Kinlq.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.323
We just shared a class together.
We weren't really friends.

15:58.830 --> 16:02.709
[Sonya] But she didn't confide
in anyone else about her fears, correct?

16:03.290 --> 16:04.109
I don't think so.

16:05.170 --> 16:08.333
Not any other friends? Her parents?

16:10.210 --> 16:12.041
[Hannah]
I don't know, it could be a stalker.

16:12.130 --> 16:13.006
[Olivia] A stalker?

16:13.090 --> 16:16.799
I highly doubt that kind of thing
is going on in our neighborhood.

16:16.890 --> 16:17.845
It's a real thing.

16:17.930 --> 16:20.171
-Celebrities have Otrl11em all the time.

16:20.270 --> 16:24.183
-So we're a celebrity now?
-No. You know what I mean. Forget it.

16:24.270 --> 16:27.819
Honey, no. Hannah.
Honey, I'm sorry. All right, I just...

16:29.320 --> 16:34.019
[sighs] Look, I think that you have
a little anxiety about this new school.

16:34.110 --> 16:35.020
It's not anxiety!

16:35.450 --> 16:38.271
Okay, I heard something out there
last night. Like clicking.

16:38.370 --> 16:39.735
Well, maybe it was the wind.

16:39.830 --> 16:43.288
Yesterday, your father was saying
he thinks the raccoons are back.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.610
It's not raccoons.

16:45.250 --> 16:49.493
Honey, look,
this is the safest neighborhood

16:49.590 --> 16:51.455
that, you know, we could afford.

16:51.550 --> 16:54.041
Your father checks statistics
on this kind of thing.

16:54.550 --> 16:58.463
And I just know... I know that for me,
when I have a lot on my mind,

16:58.550 --> 17:00.131
my mind takes revenge.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.760
Yeah. You're probably right.

17:06.730 --> 17:11.349
So, finding no help from home,
she enlists you.

17:12.190 --> 17:13.930
Mom can't help, but you can?

17:15.820 --> 17:16.650
Why you?

17:17.910 --> 17:19.025
[Courtney] I don't know.

17:19.490 --> 17:23.654
But like I said, I was there.
And she was always nice to me.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.280
[Sonya] Nice to you.

17:25.370 --> 17:29.033
Defense Exhibit C, Your Honor,
as stipulated.

17:29.960 --> 17:34.374
Uh, I'm curious, Courtney, was Hannah
just being nice to you there, too?

17:39.390 --> 17:40.675
Describe what you see, please?

17:45.480 --> 17:46.595
[sighs] There's, um...

17:48.190 --> 17:51.762
more of Tyler's photos of Hannah and me,
from that night.

17:53.440 --> 17:57.979
[Sonya] Now, you said before that
it was just a meaningless kiss, correct?

17:58.490 --> 17:59.309
[Courtney] Yes.

17:59.700 --> 18:05.445
So, now how could it be meaningless
if there's more than one?

18:07.080 --> 18:10.129
Or is that not a picture of Hannah
kissing you back?

18:12.090 --> 18:14.240
[spectators murmuring]

18:17.510 --> 18:19.717
-Hey.
-Hey, where were you this morning?

18:19.800 --> 18:22.849
I was avoiding Chle.
And, like, everyone else.

18:22.930 --> 18:23.749
What's wrong?

18:25.810 --> 18:28.882
-Someone's trying to keep me quiet.
-What? What happened?

18:28.980 --> 18:30.766
Not here. Come on.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.180
[Alex] Wow, that is seriously messed up.

18:34.900 --> 18:37.391
Yeah, somebody is fucking with my head.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.697
And my head's already
plenty fucked up all on its own.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.862
Somehow I don't see Bryce
walking into a sex shop.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.154
What about Chle?

18:49.250 --> 18:52.788
I don't know, she's in smart classes
but she does stupid things.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.791
I can't see her having any ideas.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.370
-It's gotta be someone.
-Well...

18:56.880 --> 19:00.919
whoever it is, it'll stop
if you just tell the truth tomorrow.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.887
How does that make any sense?

19:03.100 --> 19:05.000
Because they're doing it to protect Bryce.

19:05.430 --> 19:08.342
And if you tell the truth,
then there's no protecting him anymore.

19:09.180 --> 19:11.011
Yeah, that sounds easy and simple.

19:11.600 --> 19:15.434
-Well, I think it's what you have to do.
-I don't think you fucking get it, Alex.

19:17.610 --> 19:19.396
Every time I look at him, it's like...

19:20.740 --> 19:22.901
it's like it's happening all over again.

19:23.870 --> 19:24.689
Right now.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.112
Like it's gonna keep happening
for the rest of my life.

19:29.540 --> 19:30.996
Maybe this will make it stop.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.627
-Clearly, I'm all alone in this.
-Jess. ..

19:55.610 --> 19:56.429
[phone beeps]

20:04.240 --> 20:05.696
Everything cool?

20:06.910 --> 20:12.997
[coughs] Uh... yeah, sorry.
That was just my mom being... motherly.

20:13.710 --> 20:16.247
-Your mom's kinda the Gestapo, huh?
-Yeah.

20:17.130 --> 20:19.371
I saw her watching from the window
the other night.

20:19.920 --> 20:23.083
-You-- You saw that? _
-They do know about me, right?

20:25.140 --> 20:27.597
Of course.
We've been friends since first grade.

20:27.890 --> 20:30.677
Yeah, but I haven't seen them
since, like, seventh grade.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.091
And I've grown. So have you.

20:37.190 --> 20:39.476
Well, they know about you. They do.

20:39.570 --> 20:40.935
My mom was just saying

20:41.030 --> 20:43.191
that they want to have you
over for dinner, so...

20:43.530 --> 20:46.158
uh, we should do that at some point.

20:46.990 --> 20:49.151
-You sure that's a good idea?
-Did they know Hannah?

20:51.830 --> 20:52.649
Um...

20:53.410 --> 20:54.536
No. No, they didn't.

20:55.500 --> 20:58.663
You never told them about Hannah
but you've told them about me?

21:00.550 --> 21:02.006
All these secrets, Clay.

21:03.090 --> 21:07.424
I mean, I told them about Hannah.
Eventually.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.883
So you haven't told them about me
because you're still hung up on her.

21:11.600 --> 21:15.184
-[stammers] No, that has nothing--
-That's why you were in court yesterday.

21:17.230 --> 21:20.688
-How did you know that?
-Tyler Down told me.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.778
Because I asked him.
And I stood super close to him.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.191
He got all nervous and told me the truth.

21:27.860 --> 21:28.940
Yeah, um...

21:30.830 --> 21:34.038
I'm not going back. It was just one time.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.031
You keep saying that,
like it'll make it true.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.327
-I'm not going back!
-Relax.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.701
I'm messing with you. Here, eat.

21:42.630 --> 21:43.449
[sputters]

21:43.550 --> 21:46.166
-Ugh! That tastes like pasture.
-Meat is murder.

21:47.050 --> 21:48.927
-Ugh.
-[chuckles]

21:49.220 --> 21:51.597
So is choking a person to death
with weeds.

21:51.930 --> 21:52.919
I like her.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.590
She makes you try new things.
That's good for you.

21:57.560 --> 21:58.800
I'm serious.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.432
Okay? You seem less afraid
when you're with her.

22:03.900 --> 22:04.730
I like it.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.271
And it also makes me kind of sad.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.059
[Slqe] Is everything okay?

22:13.330 --> 22:14.149
Totally.

22:15.040 --> 22:18.203
But you're not here with me.

22:20.250 --> 22:21.069
I am here.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.079
Promise.

22:26.550 --> 22:29.292
Honestly, that's the truth.
It was just a game.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.170
-Truth or dare.
-[Sonya] Maybe.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.091
Or... maybe it was more.

22:37.930 --> 22:38.760
For Hannah.

22:39.140 --> 22:42.769
Maybe Hannah suggested the game
to take advantage of you.

22:42.860 --> 22:43.679
Take advantage of--

22:45.690 --> 22:46.520
Why?

22:47.360 --> 22:50.602
-Because she liked you.
-Objection. Relevance?

22:51.360 --> 22:53.271
[Sonya] It goes to motivation, Your Honor.

22:53.660 --> 22:54.729
[judge] I'll allow it.

23:01.670 --> 23:05.083
Is it just me, or is this whole
locker room concept super antiquated?

23:05.420 --> 23:08.048
Like, just 'cause there aren't guys around

23:08.130 --> 23:10.928
doesn't mean it's not weird
to get naked In front of strangers.

23:11.260 --> 23:12.796
Yeah, totally.

23:13.970 --> 23:15.801
[Sonya] Isn't that why
she asked for your help?

23:16.470 --> 23:18.222
-No.
-Rea|ly?

23:19.100 --> 23:22.592
You said you're not a lesbian.
Can you be certain that Hannah wasn't?

23:23.610 --> 23:25.646
Hey, do you wanna maybe proofread

23:25.730 --> 23:27.971
each other's papers
for Mrs. Cusick's class?

23:28.940 --> 23:31.522
I barely passed the last one,
saw you got an A.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.537
-Sure. Let's do it.
-[chuckles]

23:37.700 --> 23:41.249
Courtney, you testified that when
this picture got around campus,

23:41.330 --> 23:42.866
rumors were spread.

23:43.250 --> 23:47.368
And these additional photos show
that Hannah kissed you back.

23:48.420 --> 23:50.411
-Is all of that correct?
-Yes.

23:51.090 --> 23:53.718
Then isn't it possible
that Hannah had a crush on you?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.461
And when this picture got around,

23:55.550 --> 23:58.599
she was the one that spread the rumors,
to put the suspicion on you?

24:00.680 --> 24:02.591
Isn't Hannah the real bully here?

24:05.860 --> 24:06.679
Courtney?

24:08.190 --> 24:10.602
-No.
-But if Hannah was the aggressor,

24:11.400 --> 24:15.188
doesn't it seem that she might have been
a lesbian, or at least bisexual?

24:16.030 --> 24:19.033
And that she was using you?
Isn't that possible?

24:19.700 --> 24:23.284
No, it's not possible.
Because it was the other way around.

24:24.580 --> 24:27.458
I liked her. I was the one with the crush.

24:30.170 --> 24:31.296
[Hannah] Mmm.

24:31.670 --> 24:33.331
Maybe we should get back to the game.

24:36.550 --> 24:38.302
-Sorry.
-No worries.

24:38.970 --> 24:41.382
Like you said,
it doesn't have to mean anything, right?

24:49.900 --> 24:50.935
Hey, what's wrong?

24:56.450 --> 24:59.487
-I feel stupid.
-What? Why?

25:02.750 --> 25:06.288
Because it does mean something.

25:10.750 --> 25:11.580
To me.

25:13.880 --> 25:14.710
Oh...

25:16.510 --> 25:18.216
-Oh, I didn't, um...
-[sobs]

25:20.350 --> 25:21.169
Oh, shit.

25:22.520 --> 25:26.479
[Courtney] It was my first kiss, see?
And I felt like it was ruined.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.390
Hey.

25:27.940 --> 25:30.101
Maybe 'cause her own first kiss
had been ruined,

25:30.190 --> 25:32.681
maybe because she just felt bad, but...

25:35.200 --> 25:37.236
that's the real reason she kissed me back.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.152
That's what's in those photos
Tyler took.

25:40.830 --> 25:43.492
Proof. That she was a good friend.

25:44.450 --> 25:47.829
And maybe that means I was bullying her
the whole time. I don't know, but...

25:49.540 --> 25:50.529
that's the truth.

25:55.550 --> 25:58.462
-No further questions for this witness.
-[Dennis] Redirect, Your Honor.

25:58.550 --> 26:03.135
So, Courtney, you're saying, in fact,
that Hannah didn't bully you that night.

26:03.220 --> 26:05.927
That actually she was kind to you.

26:07.390 --> 26:08.220
Yes.

26:09.650 --> 26:12.517
Look, I didn't know Hannah that well,

26:12.610 --> 26:15.852
but that night, she was my friend.

26:17.950 --> 26:19.190
She was there for me,

26:19.660 --> 26:21.525
and Liberty
should have been there for her.

26:21.950 --> 26:23.076
What a day.

26:23.830 --> 26:26.902
It was a big win for us. And for Hannah.

26:28.290 --> 26:31.498
That poor girl, though.
That can't have been easy.

26:31.580 --> 26:34.413
Well, she must have been carrying
that around for a long time.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.751
It's what happens
when you bottle things up.

26:38.760 --> 26:42.423
This room was always so sad and empty.

26:44.100 --> 26:47.479
Do you know I've never lived alone?

26:47.560 --> 26:48.379
Huh.

26:49.310 --> 26:53.565
I went right from my parents' house
to a college roommate, and Andy.

26:53.650 --> 26:55.527
[gasps] Oh, Olivia.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.059
Oh...

27:01.700 --> 27:02.519
[Olivia] Um...

27:04.780 --> 27:07.283
I'm so sorry. I...

27:08.750 --> 27:09.648
I forgot, I...

27:12.130 --> 27:13.836
I put this in here. I, uh...

27:20.680 --> 27:22.921
This is the dress
I was wearing the day I...

27:23.890 --> 27:24.879
Ifound Hannah.

27:30.060 --> 27:33.518
I always meant to wash it,
but then I just couldn't bring myself to.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.640
I'm so sorry. I...

27:38.440 --> 27:41.523
I used to carry one of Tessa's socks
in my purse.

27:42.660 --> 27:43.479
[sighs]

27:43.870 --> 27:46.737
For months after she died,
I carried that sock everywhere.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.865
-Do you still have it?
-No.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.070
No, eventually,
I decided it was time to...

27:55.590 --> 27:56.409
to move on.

28:00.970 --> 28:01.789
Right.

28:03.550 --> 28:04.380
No, that's...

28:05.350 --> 28:07.250
that's probably what I should do, too.

28:10.310 --> 28:11.425
[Bryce] Hey, so, um...

28:11.850 --> 28:14.307
So, what's up with you
helping out Alex so much?

28:14.690 --> 28:18.012
-Are you like his butler now, or what?
-[stammers] Yeah, no. It's nothing.

28:18.110 --> 28:19.680
My mom's making me help him,

28:19.780 --> 28:22.237
because she's friends with his folks,
and, yeah.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.190
Huh.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.401
So is he gonna testify?

28:28.540 --> 28:30.405
I don't know if he can, because of the...

28:31.160 --> 28:33.242
-I mean, he's crippled.
-Right, right, right.

28:33.330 --> 28:34.740
Yeah. So when are you up?

28:34.960 --> 28:38.669
Couple days. Oh, and my mom says
thanks, by the way, for the lawyer.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.547
-Yeah, sure.
-She. ..

28:41.880 --> 28:45.714
-She said that you had already asked me?
-Yeah, no, I meant to. I just...

28:46.010 --> 28:48.342
I figured it was better to act fast,
you know?

28:49.430 --> 28:51.728
Yeah, no, that totally makes sense.

28:52.180 --> 28:54.842
But... so does_that mean
they called you In, too, or...?

28:54.940 --> 28:57.556
No. I'm just lookin' out for you.

28:58.480 --> 29:00.016
-We're in this together, right?
-Yeah.

29:06.990 --> 29:10.574
I'm gonna catch up with you at practice.
My mitt's in the car. So...

29:10.990 --> 29:11.820
All right.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.160
[sighs]

29:15.670 --> 29:16.489
What's their deal?

29:16.580 --> 29:18.787
I get that you're not called,
but I still could be.

29:19.290 --> 29:21.702
I have to be ready. I need to know
what was on those tapes.

29:22.090 --> 29:24.160
Maybe it's better you only know
what Jessica told you.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.171
-Why? Why is everyone protecting me?
-[bangs]

29:27.550 --> 29:31.008
-What the fuck are you two looking at?
-Hey, come on, buddy.

29:31.100 --> 29:32.135
Come on.

29:32.220 --> 29:34.518
-Alex, you need to calm down.
-You need to wake up.

29:34.770 --> 29:36.180
You heard what happened to Courtney.

29:36.270 --> 29:38.181
_ Who knows
what JeSSIca's gonna do tomorrow?

29:38.270 --> 29:43.355
Okay? I can't-- I can't fail at this, too.

29:47.070 --> 29:49.982
[Courtney] It's not always easy to know
how to be a friend, but...

29:51.740 --> 29:53.992
Hannah knew how and she was brave.

29:54.500 --> 29:58.038
[Chle] One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

29:58.120 --> 30:01.283
One, two, three, four, five, six...

30:01.840 --> 30:03.159
-[Jessica] Sorry.
-[music stops]

30:04.130 --> 30:05.961
[Chle] Okay. That's okay, guys, um...

30:06.720 --> 30:07.675
Everyone, take five.

30:08.930 --> 30:10.295
[Jessica sighs]

30:11.050 --> 30:12.551
-Hey.
-Hi.

30:12.640 --> 30:16.269
-Is, uh... Is everything okay?
-Yeah, fine.

30:16.730 --> 30:19.938
Okay, look, it's... it's not.
And I'm just gonna say this,

30:20.020 --> 30:21.851
because that's what leaders do, right?

30:23.360 --> 30:26.739
[sighs] Look, um, I messed up yesterday.

30:27.700 --> 30:31.238
I should've talked to you about Bryce,
us dating.

30:31.910 --> 30:35.448
I didn't realize how it might affect you,
on the squad and...

30:35.830 --> 30:37.957
and I'd hate for that to be weird.

30:38.790 --> 30:39.779
"Weird"?

30:39.870 --> 30:42.122
I know that you and Bryce
had a thing, but...

30:42.380 --> 30:45.122
it's before my time, you know?
And it's just one night.

30:46.090 --> 30:48.001
I really do think it's so brave of you,

30:48.090 --> 30:49.967
coming back here
after everything that happened.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.590
"Everything that happened"?

30:54.220 --> 30:57.474
Yeah, you know, like,
what everyone's saying.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.187
That you cheated on Justin

30:59.270 --> 31:02.228
and called it rape, or whatever,
'cause you regretted it.

31:03.060 --> 31:06.029
Which-- Hey, look, look,
I totally... I totally understand,

31:06.110 --> 31:08.487
because, you know,
I should know, he's my man.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.157
But... I don't have a problem with it,

31:11.240 --> 31:14.573
so there's no reason why we should
have to let that affect our work, right?

31:16.330 --> 31:18.867
[sighs] Oh, God.
Okay, Jessica, look. I'm so--

31:18.960 --> 31:19.995
Don't touch me!

31:20.870 --> 31:22.872
-[Chle sighs]
-[camera shutter clicks]

31:25.500 --> 31:29.618
Really? This is for yearbook?
Don't you have windows to stalk, perv?

31:32.140 --> 31:33.175
Off with you!

31:34.800 --> 31:37.098
[man]
I'm sorry, Tyler. The decision is final.

31:37.930 --> 31:41.843
[door opening, closing]

31:42.270 --> 31:43.396
What? What happened?

31:44.190 --> 31:45.851
Mr. Kurtz just freaked out on me.

31:45.940 --> 31:49.148
Apparently, I'm no longer allowed
to photograph female sports.

31:50.030 --> 31:54.239
This is how our school has decided
to "respond" to my testimony.

31:54.660 --> 31:58.403
By only letting you photograph
the jocks who bullied you.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.649
This school is king of irony.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.037
Yeah,
I don't really understand irony, exactly.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.456
Yeah, no one really does.

32:09.550 --> 32:12.838
Hey, so, um, did you make a copy
of Hannah's tapes?

32:14.510 --> 32:15.340
Why?

32:16.850 --> 32:18.556
[stammers] I mean, I thought about it.

32:19.220 --> 32:21.677
For insurance, or whatever, but...

32:23.520 --> 32:24.339
No.

32:25.650 --> 32:26.469
[clears throat]

32:27.020 --> 32:28.009
Well, thanks.

32:28.730 --> 32:29.560
Sorry.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.389
Hey, um...

32:34.990 --> 32:37.447
Those pictures you took of me
in the hospital...

32:38.660 --> 32:39.479
um...

32:40.120 --> 32:41.075
can I see them?

32:41.910 --> 32:42.740
Yeah.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.109
Yeah. Of course.

32:55.930 --> 32:57.249
[keyboard clicking]

32:57.350 --> 32:58.169
It's, uh...

33:00.810 --> 33:02.095
it's a lot to take in.

33:03.850 --> 33:04.680
Yeah.

33:08.310 --> 33:09.140
[mouse clicking]

33:34.880 --> 33:36.541
Why did I do this to myself?

33:37.930 --> 33:39.170
You didn't do this.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.466
Everyone else at this school did.

33:44.140 --> 33:47.769
So, the credits from detention
transfer 50 percent.

33:48.480 --> 33:52.393
Depending on what your teachers say,
you'll probably have to do summer school.

33:53.820 --> 33:54.639
That's fine.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.019
Um...

33:58.700 --> 34:00.986
how does it feel being back?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.117
[scoffs] How do you think?

34:04.000 --> 34:07.037
I imagine it's been difficult.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.748
But, um, I was hoping
that you would tell me.

34:10.250 --> 34:11.080
If you want.

34:11.630 --> 34:15.464
It's only been half a day. I mean,
everyone stares, no one says anything.

34:15.550 --> 34:16.369
Hmm.

34:18.010 --> 34:19.887
Thinking about going back to cheerleading?

34:20.090 --> 34:22.138
-[scoffs] Are you kidding?
-No.

34:23.100 --> 34:26.763
Don't you know about what goes on
at this school? Or at least have an idea?

34:27.600 --> 34:31.479
Yes, I do. That's why I... I want to help.

34:33.690 --> 34:35.988
I think we both understand,
too little, too late.

34:36.490 --> 34:38.026
I hope it's never too late.

34:41.120 --> 34:41.939
Shen.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.571
Why don't we schedule a check-in?

34:48.210 --> 34:52.499
[scoffs] Nah, I'm good. But I'll be sure
to stop by though, if I'm ever raped.

35:00.050 --> 35:00.960
[Zach] Good.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.308
Nice. Dude, your, your balance
is totally better than last week.

35:05.930 --> 35:08.012
One more big push. Let's do this, come on.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.089
[grunts]

35:13.900 --> 35:17.108
-What's going on, man?
-My legs don't work.

35:17.190 --> 35:19.943
And my brain doesn't work. My arms hurt.

35:20.610 --> 35:23.488
-I'm a worthless piece of shit.
-Dude, come on.

35:23.570 --> 35:24.446
No!

35:25.490 --> 35:28.573
Okay? It's true, man.
I can't help Jessica.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.207
-I can't remember shit.
-Your memory--

35:30.290 --> 35:32.121
Everyone that could
help me remember won't.

35:32.210 --> 35:35.498
-Your memory will come back, just--
-You're a fucking doctor now?

35:35.750 --> 35:36.990
How do you know that?

35:37.380 --> 35:39.962
What the fuck do you even know
about what I'm going through?

35:40.760 --> 35:41.795
Why are you even here?

35:43.760 --> 35:47.639
Go hang out with the rest
of your dumb jock fucking rapist friends.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.971
[panﬁng]

35:54.110 --> 35:55.566
I need a lift out of here.

35:56.270 --> 35:58.022
-Ask your doctor.
-What is this?

35:58.610 --> 36:00.601
Some twisted physical therapy test?

36:00.700 --> 36:03.351
Yeah, okay, I don't know exactly
what you're going through.

36:03.950 --> 36:07.078
_But I_know what it's like to feel
like shIt's never gonna get better.

36:08.290 --> 36:12.203
Every time I come home to my empty
fucking house, I remember that feeling.

36:12.710 --> 36:15.122
Zach, I forgot.

36:15.210 --> 36:18.418
And I come here every single day
because I remember last summer.

36:19.130 --> 36:22.509
-It was PT that helped me get through it.
-I'm really sorry.

36:24.550 --> 36:28.099
You know, I could still really use
a lift out of here.

36:48.450 --> 36:49.906
-[Olivia] Jackie!
-Hmm?

36:51.910 --> 36:56.574
-You had no right! No right!
-Olivia, I'm sorry, I thought you said--

36:56.670 --> 37:01.164
Well, I didn't say! Okay?
This was all I had left.

37:01.260 --> 37:04.923
Everything else is in evidence,
or donated, or gone.

37:05.800 --> 37:08.633
Andy wanted to fucking get rid
of everything. And he did it.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.967
And, Jesus, the clothes he wore that day,
he washed them,

37:12.060 --> 37:13.379
and he wore them again!

37:15.440 --> 37:16.259
This-- [sobs]

37:17.610 --> 37:19.680
My daughter's blood. [sobs]

37:20.070 --> 37:23.608
Oh, God. Olivia, I am so, so sorry.

37:23.690 --> 37:27.023
-I thought this was what you wanted.
-No! Don't!

37:27.110 --> 37:28.270
Just don't, don't--

37:28.370 --> 37:30.827
I never would've dreamed, honestly. I'm...

37:30.910 --> 37:33.196
We were talking about that girl,

37:33.290 --> 37:36.077
on the stand, being bottled up,
I just wanted to help.

37:36.170 --> 37:40.709
You can't help with this part, okay?
Because I'm not...

37:41.750 --> 37:44.378
I'm not... I'm not that girl.

37:45.510 --> 37:47.671
And this part I have to do on my own.
I do.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.796
Whatever's going to happen, I have to...
[sobs]

37:51.180 --> 37:54.343
I have to do it in my time, in my way.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.430
Yes.

38:01.270 --> 38:02.567
I should...

38:02.650 --> 38:05.062
-No. No. No, I...
-I should go.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.439
["Woman is a Word" plays]

38:14.540 --> 38:17.998
[Courtney] Instead of facing my fears
and clearing up all the rumors,

38:18.540 --> 38:19.916
I let Hannah take the fall.

38:21.250 --> 38:24.299
I was afraid of what people might think
if they knew.

38:25.510 --> 38:28.752
I'm only an image of what you see

38:29.800 --> 38:32.928
I'm only an image of what you see

38:33.560 --> 38:37.098
I'm only an image of what you see

38:37.180 --> 38:41.059
Courtney, some people might wonder,
if you didn't tell the truth for so long,

38:41.310 --> 38:43.221
how do we know
you're telling the truth now?

38:44.320 --> 38:45.469
Because it was time.

38:46.530 --> 38:48.270
And because I owe it to Hannah.

38:50.990 --> 38:53.527
[Courtney] And I guess we all have things
we try to hide.

38:53.620 --> 38:56.441
I'm only a woman if woman is a word

38:56.540 --> 38:58.280
But they can't stay hidden forever.

39:04.710 --> 39:07.588
-[Jessica] That was brave.
-Sorry?

39:08.090 --> 39:11.799
I read that blog. What you did today,
at court, it was brave.

39:12.140 --> 39:14.677
-I don't know about that.
-No, It was.

39:14.810 --> 39:18.132
-You helped Hannah.
-Yeah, but I hurt her first.

39:18.310 --> 39:21.097
[stammers] I told lies about her
and I messed up her life.

39:22.690 --> 39:24.009
You weren't the only one.

39:26.690 --> 39:29.773
Did anyone threaten you
before you testified?

39:30.570 --> 39:31.400
No.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.572
Why? Did something happen to you?

39:36.580 --> 39:37.865
No, no, I...

39:41.290 --> 39:44.123
Was it hard... to tell the truth?

39:45.040 --> 39:45.870
Yes.

39:47.760 --> 39:48.579
But it was time.

39:49.550 --> 39:53.008
I'm only a woman if woman is a word

39:53.090 --> 39:54.796
Bird to a bee...

39:56.100 --> 39:57.761
[Courtney] And I think this trial...

39:57.970 --> 40:00.848
this trial is going to force
a lot of people to tell the truth.

40:03.190 --> 40:05.351
For better, or for worse.

Uh, hello? Mom?

40:42.350 --> 40:44.978
[Matt] Hey, kiddo. Your mom's
still at work. We're in here.

40:45.350 --> 40:47.306
[Matt speaks indistinctly]

40:47.400 --> 40:50.858
It's like gluten-free pasta.
It's like moisture-free water.

40:52.570 --> 40:53.855
[Slqe] Sounds delicious.

40:54.160 --> 40:58.028
-[Clay] Guys, what's going on?
-We're making hand-rolled pasta.

40:58.410 --> 41:00.196
Your dad taught me. Wait, check it!

41:00.740 --> 41:01.570
[dough splatters]

41:01.660 --> 41:03.958
-[Matt] When it's done, it'll stick.
-Okay.

41:04.040 --> 41:06.702
And why are we hand-rolling pasta?

41:07.130 --> 41:09.451
Slqe said she liked Italian.
Figure it's the least we could do.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.835
It's our first dinner together.

41:10.920 --> 41:13.127
Your mom's thrilled, by the way.
Big points scored.

41:14.010 --> 41:17.639
_ -Our first dinner.
-Clay, this was your Idea, remember?

41:17.720 --> 41:22.339
-We talked about it at lunch.
-Um, yeah, that's not exactly...

41:22.810 --> 41:25.222
-Slqe, I think this might be ready.
-Yeah. Okay.

41:25.310 --> 41:26.390
You wanna try again?

41:27.560 --> 41:28.891
-Ready?
-Yeah. Try not to...

41:28.980 --> 41:30.891
-Ooh, ow. [puffs]
-Okay.

41:30.980 --> 41:32.106
-[pop51
-Hey!

41:32.190 --> 41:34.272
Oh, my God! Yes!

41:34.450 --> 41:36.520
- Bella, bella. Molto bene!
-[Skye] Totally sticks.

41:37.660 --> 41:42.108
[Mr. Down] That is graphic.
I don't know if I approve of this game.

41:42.790 --> 41:43.609
Let's go again.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.069
Dad, what is this?

41:48.500 --> 41:49.660
What? No, I wanna learn.

41:51.380 --> 41:53.416
Well, at this rate,
that's gonna take years.

41:53.710 --> 41:54.540
[scoffs]

41:54.920 --> 41:58.299
Besides, I heard you on the phone
with the school, earlier.

41:59.680 --> 42:00.499
So, what's up?

42:03.850 --> 42:06.762
Well, I was wondering
if maybe we should, um,

42:07.390 --> 42:10.689
transfer you to... another school.

42:13.570 --> 42:14.389
Really?

42:17.030 --> 42:20.989
But... how would that look for colleges?

42:21.830 --> 42:25.539
Well, I really just want to make sure
that you make it to college.

42:27.160 --> 42:30.072
But, I mean, what about my friends here?

42:31.880 --> 42:35.122
-I have Alex. He needs me, Dad.
-I know.

42:35.420 --> 42:38.423
But Alex,
he's recovering from a traumatic...

42:39.890 --> 42:42.632
and I don't know
if it's the healthiest thing for you.

42:43.260 --> 42:46.058
-So, I can't hang out with him anymore?
-No, but...

42:48.390 --> 42:51.302
Is there no one else, you know,
that you have a connection with?

42:51.860 --> 42:52.679
No, I do.

42:53.650 --> 42:56.733
Actually, yeah, no.
[stammers] I... totally forgot.

42:56.820 --> 42:59.732
Uh, Cyrus, in Mr. Porter's class.

42:59.820 --> 43:04.484
He's like an amazing artist.
And, you'd-- um, you'd like him.

43:04.580 --> 43:05.820
-That's great.
-Yeah.

43:05.910 --> 43:07.366
-Great! Bring him over.
-Cool.

43:07.450 --> 43:08.496
We'll play some vids.

43:10.210 --> 43:11.495
No one calls them that.

43:13.340 --> 43:14.204
I call them that.

43:16.260 --> 43:17.079
Okay.

43:18.510 --> 43:22.719
[Todd] All right, here we go. Yes.

43:24.720 --> 43:26.676
Desert Hearts is supposed to be a classic.

43:26.770 --> 43:29.307
The Kids Are All Right,
Blue is the Warmest Color...

43:30.730 --> 43:33.016
-Maybe we wait and watch this one last.
-Wha...

43:33.110 --> 43:35.476
Isn't this just very binary thinking?

43:35.570 --> 43:38.061
Movies and shows are a wonderful way
to open up a dialogue.

43:38.150 --> 43:41.779
So we're screening one about a man
who breaks up a lesbian couple?

43:42.360 --> 43:44.408
-Oh, God. I forgot about that part.
-Yeah.

43:44.740 --> 43:47.117
At_ least the lesbians
aren't serial killers or policewomen.

43:47.200 --> 43:50.203
And the male gaze makes
Blue is the Warmest Color very suspect

43:50.290 --> 43:52.076
as fodder for positive conversation.

43:52.170 --> 43:56.163
Good Lord, you overanalyze everything.
Probably why she didn't tell us before.

43:58.300 --> 44:01.212
-Are you saying that it is my fault?
-It's nobody's fault.

44:04.180 --> 44:07.889
-Or it's my fault.
-Oh, no, no, no. No.

44:08.390 --> 44:12.383
-Honey, honey. Aww. Hey, sweetie--
-[sobbing]

44:13.150 --> 44:15.550
Everyone takes the time they take.

44:17.520 --> 44:18.771
[Steve] Why are you crying?

44:20.150 --> 44:21.777
[sniffles] It's nothing, it's...

44:24.990 --> 44:26.696
[sighs] You're just amazing, and...

44:28.370 --> 44:30.361
-I'm so luclq to have you both.
-Oh.

44:33.540 --> 44:35.201
Come on. Come here.

44:39.340 --> 44:40.659
[whispers] We love you.

44:41.470 --> 44:43.927
[Courtney]
The truth can free you if you let it.

44:44.260 --> 44:46.592
[Lainie] So it's graffiti?

44:47.390 --> 44:50.598
It's a... It's a mural, Mom.
It's called street art.

44:50.810 --> 44:53.688
It's very popular.
It's one of the oldest art forms.

44:53.770 --> 44:56.682
If you think about it,
cave paintings were street art.

44:56.770 --> 44:59.853
-Yeah. Yes.
-That's-- Thank you, Dad.

45:00.610 --> 45:04.853
And, um, how long have you two
been making this art?

45:05.240 --> 45:06.446
-Couple months.
-Not long.

45:06.530 --> 45:09.442
Months! This must be some mural.
[chuckles]

45:09.830 --> 45:13.368
-Well, we don't always paint.
-No?

45:14.160 --> 45:16.822
You don't? You're gone for hours, Clay.
What else are you doing?

45:16.920 --> 45:20.412
-Yeah, what else do we do, Clay?
-We, um...

45:21.000 --> 45:24.504
-We hang out. Mostly.
-What does that mean?

45:24.590 --> 45:27.844
I never know. Is that slang for sex?

45:28.100 --> 45:29.840
-Mom!
-That's "hook up," honey.

45:29.930 --> 45:30.999
Hook up, yes.

45:31.100 --> 45:36.049
Well, if you two are, um, hooking up...
I just hope you're being careful.

45:36.900 --> 45:43.237
We, uh... aren't. Hooking up, I mean.
We're, uh... So... all good.

45:43.320 --> 45:45.026
-Yep.
-Okay.

45:46.240 --> 45:49.528
Um... should we-- can we be excused?

45:49.990 --> 45:51.821
What's gotten into you?
We're in the middle of dinner.

45:52.370 --> 45:54.656
-Nothing, I'm just full.
-Yeah.

45:54.750 --> 45:58.163
This pasta is filling.
Yeah, it was so good, though.

45:58.250 --> 46:00.411
-So good.
-So thank you, guys. Appreciate it.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.298
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Thanks for dinner, guys.

46:05.590 --> 46:07.217
-Bye.
-You guys are the best. Thanks.

46:11.310 --> 46:12.504
Jesus, what is your--?

46:15.020 --> 46:15.839
Holy shit.

46:29.070 --> 46:31.026
[indistinct chattering]

46:31.120 --> 46:32.405
[man] Don't forget to breathe.

46:32.990 --> 46:34.867
-I am breathing.
-You're not, so much.

46:38.580 --> 46:40.207
[grunts]

46:41.670 --> 46:42.489
Wow.

46:43.050 --> 46:46.258
That's some hard hits today.
You got something on your mind?

46:46.670 --> 46:49.924
[pants] Nah, I don't. I just need you...

46:51.300 --> 46:54.383
to sign this form
for my probation officer.

46:54.470 --> 46:55.596
Right on.

46:56.390 --> 46:58.802
Six more sessions left. Not bad.

46:59.440 --> 47:02.147
Think your anger's been adequately
managed in our time together?

47:02.560 --> 47:04.528
Huh. I'll let you know.

47:06.110 --> 47:08.692
We gotta get in the ring
before you're done. You and me.

47:09.360 --> 47:13.148
Uh... I don't think so. But thank you.

47:16.160 --> 47:19.459
She washes one dress
and it sets me back five months.

47:20.080 --> 47:23.038
I swear, I was ready to kick her out
right then and there.

47:26.340 --> 47:31.209
But I think she might be a friend,
and I don't have many of those right now.

47:33.760 --> 47:36.137
-Present company excluded.
-No, I get it.

47:37.020 --> 47:38.510
Friends who aren't in high school.

47:38.600 --> 47:39.419
[chuckles]

47:42.560 --> 47:43.470
You know, Andy...

47:45.110 --> 47:48.147
Andy used to tell me, when I'd listen
to the tapes for the umpteenth time,

47:48.240 --> 47:52.654
and I would call you with new questions,
he would say how inappropriate it was

47:52.740 --> 47:54.310
that I was spending time with you.

47:54.620 --> 47:57.828
Really? You didn't tell him
that I don't play for your team?

47:59.250 --> 48:01.206
What happened to that boyfriend of yours?

48:01.290 --> 48:04.077
The handsome guy?
I haven't seen him around in weeks.

48:05.500 --> 48:07.206
-Brad.
-Brad.

48:10.010 --> 48:11.045
Yeah, we broke up.

48:12.430 --> 48:14.079
Oh. That's too bad.

48:16.310 --> 48:18.517
-He was pretty.
-Yeah.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.761
He didn't talk much,
but he was very pretty.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.430
What happened?

48:25.190 --> 48:26.100
Um...

48:27.190 --> 48:29.317
He didn't want to date a kid anymore.

48:31.360 --> 48:34.659
Wanted bigger things.
He was tired of the high school bullshit.

48:35.070 --> 48:37.652
Here I am, bringing you more
high school bullshit, huh?

48:37.740 --> 48:41.494
No, never. I'm here for you, always.

48:46.380 --> 48:48.792
God, I sit in that courtroom, Tony,

48:51.340 --> 48:53.422
and I feel like I never knew my daughter.

48:55.840 --> 49:01.176
She kept all these... secrets.
Why did she have so many secrets?

49:03.600 --> 49:04.680
I think, uh...

49:06.770 --> 49:10.524
I think, sometimes, we aren't keeping
secrets to hide from other people.

49:12.280 --> 49:15.852
I think, sometimes, we're keeping them
to protect those people.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.527
[soft rock song plays]

49:21.870 --> 49:23.201
-[Skye] What's wrong?
-[Clay] Nothing.

49:27.540 --> 49:30.293
-Okay, just stop.
-Wait, I...

49:30.380 --> 49:31.620
Stop. Just...

49:39.470 --> 49:44.305
-Are you ashamed of me?
-What? Slqe, no. I...

49:44.770 --> 49:47.227
Then what the fuck is going on here, Clay?

49:48.060 --> 49:51.268
I mean, why didn't your parents
know about me?

49:52.190 --> 49:57.776
Because they're my parents. They meddle.
Honestly, it has nothing to do with you.

49:57.860 --> 49:59.316
-Rea|ly?
-Yeah.

49:59.950 --> 50:02.783
It doesn't have to do with the way I look?

50:02.870 --> 50:06.112
Or that I have,
like, tattoos and piercings

50:06.210 --> 50:07.859
and, like, cuts all over?

50:07.960 --> 50:10.872
Jesus, Slqe, no.
I don't care about that stuff.

50:10.960 --> 50:11.790
You know that.

50:12.800 --> 50:17.089
-You don't care. Of course.
-WaIt...

50:18.590 --> 50:20.546
Slqe, hang on. Let's just--

50:21.140 --> 50:22.596
That's not what I meant, okay?

50:22.680 --> 50:26.559
What I mean is, I like the way you look.
I like you.

50:26.890 --> 50:30.018
Really? Because your body
is kinda saying the opposite.

50:30.650 --> 50:32.436
Maybe my head's still scrambled

50:32.520 --> 50:34.522
from you trying to jerk me off
in front of my parents.

50:34.610 --> 50:35.850
Well, I'm sorry!

50:36.190 --> 50:39.489
I'm sorry for trying to be
fucking spontaneous!

50:39.570 --> 50:42.733
You could've talked to me, you didn't have
to just show up at my house.

50:43.450 --> 50:44.360
It was weird!

50:44.450 --> 50:48.864
I'll tell you what's weird: you still
being in love with a fucking dead girl.

50:51.000 --> 50:51.830
Don't...

50:52.090 --> 50:55.708
-Don't say that, please. That's not true.
-Rea|ly?

50:56.670 --> 51:00.299
You freaked out at our spot last night
the day that her case is going to trial.

51:00.390 --> 51:04.133
Then you freaked out at lunch today
because I brought up you going to court.

51:04.220 --> 51:08.008
It's like, wherever we go, she's there!

51:08.480 --> 51:09.629
No. That's not...

51:10.940 --> 51:11.759
thatsinsane.

51:12.190 --> 51:13.225
[Slqe and Hannah] Is it?

51:13.610 --> 51:17.489
It's all about Hannah, Clay,
and it always will be.

51:17.940 --> 51:23.446
How am I supposed to compete with that?
She's perfect. And she's dead.

51:23.530 --> 51:27.159
-Really, Slqe. Can we sit and talk?
-I don't wanna fucking sit down!

51:28.960 --> 51:31.531
Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me you love me.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.201
Tell me you're over her, then.

51:35.630 --> 51:38.667
I... I love you. I...

51:39.260 --> 51:40.079
And?

51:42.590 --> 51:44.842
And you're over me.
Clay, it's okay, just say it.

51:50.560 --> 51:52.266
-Clay?
-I can't!

51:56.190 --> 51:59.353
[sighs] I'm sorry, but I can't say that.

52:01.860 --> 52:05.193
You have been lying to me,

52:05.280 --> 52:07.111
you fucking liar!

52:07.200 --> 52:10.112
Slqe! Skye! Shit.

52:10.540 --> 52:11.825
Slqe!

52:12.920 --> 52:14.035
Slqe.

52:22.010 --> 52:23.750
-[bike starting]
-Slqe.

52:24.010 --> 52:26.501
[motor rewing]

52:27.720 --> 52:28.596
Fuck.

52:31.770 --> 52:35.103
-[Hannah] What are you gonna do?
-I'm gonna go after her.

52:35.440 --> 52:39.479
-You sure that's a good idea?
-No. I think it's a terrible idea.

52:39.570 --> 52:42.733
But a worse idea is staying here
and discussing it all with you, so...

52:43.700 --> 52:46.271
You think that's what she wants,
for you to chase her?

52:46.530 --> 52:49.693
Are you serious right now?
Are you fucking serious?

52:51.330 --> 52:52.786
"Part of me was saying, 'Don't go."'

52:53.290 --> 52:56.453
Remember that, Hannah?
Your words. My tape.

52:56.790 --> 52:59.202
-"Part of me was saying, 'Don't go."'
-I remember.

52:59.300 --> 53:01.416
Well, there you go.

53:02.760 --> 53:04.170
She's not me, Clay.

53:05.640 --> 53:06.459
No.

53:07.140 --> 53:07.959
No one is.

53:10.430 --> 53:14.639
I think it projects strength
and confidence, don't you?

53:16.770 --> 53:18.681
Maybe we can pull your hair back a little?

53:19.820 --> 53:20.718
Something like this?

53:21.740 --> 53:24.140
Sure, Mom. Whatever you think.

53:28.330 --> 53:30.195
[mother]
Want to sleep in your own bed tonight?

53:31.080 --> 53:33.492
-You must be getting tired of our floor.
-No.

53:35.080 --> 53:35.910
No, I'm not.

53:39.000 --> 53:39.830
Okay.

53:42.550 --> 53:45.622
[Courtney] Or fear of the truth
can keep you trapped in your secrets.

53:46.640 --> 53:51.259
[Sonya] In discovery, the plaintiffs found
that your date book was missing a page,

53:52.520 --> 53:54.135
which seems to be the page

53:54.230 --> 53:56.801
from the last date
of your meeting with Hannah.

53:58.190 --> 54:00.101
-Hmm.
-I'm not gonna ask you

54:00.190 --> 54:03.023
why that page is missing.
Not now, not in court. But they will.

54:05.530 --> 54:09.773
Well, I heard you made Courtney Crimsen
come out on the stand today.

54:09.870 --> 54:12.532
That's... that's messed up.

54:12.700 --> 54:14.327
I didn't make her do anything.

54:16.210 --> 54:18.201
I just asked the questions I had to ask.

54:18.920 --> 54:23.209
They're kids. They're children.

54:24.590 --> 54:25.966
They knew what they were doing.

54:27.930 --> 54:28.749
Did you?

54:39.560 --> 54:41.721
[Courtney]
And someone who's keeping a secret...

Slqe! Wait, Mrs. Miller! What is she--
