WEBVTT

00:05.880 --> 00:08.382
Oh, come on, Jase.
Let's go.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.676
Hey, you can't rush dynamite.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.799
- You said... Hey-hey... Hey-hey-hey.
- Hey-hey, easy.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.348
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Brace yourself.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.183
All right, let's hurry up.
I gotta git.

00:18.309 --> 00:19.643
What's your hurry?

00:19.769 --> 00:20.936
I've gotta find a gift
for my wife.

00:21.062 --> 00:22.312
It's our 25th anniversary.

00:22.439 --> 00:23.897
Ooh, 25... That's a big'un.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.524
That's a biggy.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.860
You're just now thinking
about a gift?

00:27.986 --> 00:29.445
I'm having a hard time coming up

00:29.571 --> 00:31.196
with the perfect
25th anniversary gift
for Korie,

00:31.322 --> 00:32.614
so I decided to spend some time

00:32.741 --> 00:33.782
with my brothers

00:33.908 --> 00:35.325
demolishing old duck blinds

00:35.452 --> 00:37.244
to see if they
could help me out.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.456
What did you get Missy for
y'all's 25th anniversary?

00:40.582 --> 00:41.999
I didn't get her anything.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.751
Ooh.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.127
We just did it a month later.

00:45.253 --> 00:47.421
Al, what did you get Lisa?
Hey, we, uh...

00:47.547 --> 00:48.881
Mostly, it's just reminding me

00:49.007 --> 00:50.466
that if I don't get Korie
the right gift,

00:50.592 --> 00:52.801
she's likely going
to demolish me too.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.637
I got Lisa 24 red roses

00:55.764 --> 00:58.348
and then one white rose
right in the middle.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.725
Well, that kinda sucks.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.143
There were other things.
We took a trip.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.062
But she got the runs.

01:04.773 --> 01:05.981
Huh.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.347
That's a mood killer.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.444
I hope Korie is getting
better advice

01:10.570 --> 01:12.654
than what I'm getting
from these imbeciles.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.990
Here's what you get her.
Never been done before.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.950
Twenty-five earrings.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.994
Should there be one extra one
left over?

01:19.120 --> 01:21.580
Then you can get
your ear pierced,
and you could wear one.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.582
Be like Harrison Ford.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.242
He looks good with an earring.

01:28.671 --> 01:31.298
Robertson men
aren't exactly known

01:31.424 --> 01:33.801
for their gift-giving
abilities.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.844
Twenty-five pairs
of lingerie.

01:35.970 --> 01:39.010
Twenty-five earrings.
That way, you get...
benefit as well.

01:39.015 --> 01:42.684
I've never been able to crack
the gift-giving code

01:42.811 --> 01:44.394
when it comes to women.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.772
Twenty-five earrings
and 25 shoes.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.357
God, that's terrible.

01:48.483 --> 01:51.527
Have you ever heard
someone giving 25 earrings?

01:51.653 --> 01:53.253
Nobody would do that.
Nobody's that dumb.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.322
But I have learned a few things.

01:55.448 --> 01:58.826
When she says,
"You don't have to buy me
anything this year,"

01:58.952 --> 02:00.911
that is a lie.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.497
That means you spare no expense,

02:03.623 --> 02:06.166
and you buy as many things
as possible.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.584
Get her 25 doves.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.002
Twenty-five horses.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.369
Clydesdales.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.943
Twenty-five earrings,
I'm telling you.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.725
I keep coming back to it.
That's what you do.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.551
Twenty-five earrings is stupid.
That's out.

02:15.677 --> 02:19.304
And the last thing is,
if you're asking me for advice,

02:19.430 --> 02:21.265
you're in trouble.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.474
All right, I wrote all these
down in my mind,

02:22.600 --> 02:24.268
so thanks for the help.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.019
It was very useless.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.146
Can we go?

02:27.272 --> 02:28.512
Let's get out of here.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.224
I still think 25 earrings
would...

02:49.335 --> 02:50.711
Jase, shut up.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.839
<i>¶¶</i>

03:06.728 --> 03:08.687
Uh-oh. Uh-oh!
Si got him one.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.523
He got 'im.
Oh, Si, that's bait!

03:11.649 --> 03:13.984
A little ol' crappie.
You can throw him back.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.319
Hey, give him here...

03:15.445 --> 03:18.197
Hey!
I hate a bridge.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.908
Si, this would've been
a great fishing hole

03:21.034 --> 03:23.327
before the invention
of the automobile.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.870
You're bad-mouthing my hole,
son.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.496
You said it was a secret spot.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.290
I come out here,
it's on a bridge.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.126
No, ain't nobody knows
about this spot, boy.

03:31.252 --> 03:32.732
Yeah.
Atta boy.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.213
So much for a secret spot.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.631
Daggone.
Si.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.466
What?
There's two things

03:37.592 --> 03:40.928
that congregate on bridges...
fish and rednecks.
No.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.930
The fish are under the bridge.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.432
Whoo...

03:45.475 --> 03:46.725
Hey, you never bad-mouth

03:46.851 --> 03:48.560
a man's fishing hole.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.897
Si, all it takes is one person
to be sending a text,

03:52.023 --> 03:53.023
and we're dead.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.483
Y'all need to go buy y'all

03:54.609 --> 03:56.360
a attitude adjustment kit.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.326
Hey, don't yell.
You'll give our location away.

03:58.446 --> 03:59.696
Hey.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.302
Especially if you're
catching yourself

04:01.366 --> 04:02.783
a boatload of fish.

04:02.909 --> 04:03.909
Good night.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.035
Oh, no!
He's got it.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.161
Okay, baby, come on here.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.162
Uh-oh, hang on.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.163
There he is.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.404
Oh, boy.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.540
I got one.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.126
Whoo, that's a perfect eater.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.337
Hey, you was just bad-mouthing
my spot.

04:15.463 --> 04:18.507
Hey, watch the attitude
and show some gratitude.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.193
I just think
it's a little embarrassing.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.468
No, if you're catching fish,

04:21.594 --> 04:22.636
there ain't no embarrassment
to it.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.388
You're missing the point, Si.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.514
No, that is the point.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.015
We're catching fish.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.601
Hey, you're welcome
for the fish, you dummy.

04:29.727 --> 04:32.187
All right, look.
We got more than we can eat
in one sitting.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.313
Let's get out of here.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.773
Farewell.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.149
You stay here in case
somebody drives by

04:36.276 --> 04:37.067
and tries to steal our stuff.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.819
You got it.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.946
Hey, what's that
on your stupid car window?

04:41.072 --> 04:42.739
Somebody trying
to sell me something.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.491
No, that looks official.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.243
Uh-oh.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.203
That's a dang ticket.

04:48.329 --> 04:49.969
A ticket out here?
For what?

04:49.998 --> 04:51.790
"Illegal parking on shoulder."

04:51.916 --> 04:53.583
Well, you need to pay this.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.377
What do you mean
I need to pay it?
This your truck.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.421
This is your hole!
It was your idea!

04:57.547 --> 04:59.298
Yeah, but, I mean,
it's your truck.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.757
If it was my truck,
I wouldn't pay it.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.342
I'd go to court over it.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.761
We put that bridge
across this stupid thing.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.513
My taxes, your taxes,

05:06.639 --> 05:09.391
his taxes, Martin's taxes,
Phil's taxes.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.935
That is pretty...
Your taxes, my taxes,
Phil's taxes.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.562
We built that bridge.
Yeah.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.105
And then we can't fish on it?

05:15.231 --> 05:16.565
This still is America, right?

05:16.691 --> 05:17.691
We need to split it.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.526
Hey, it's his spot.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.069
Hey, I'm gonna tell you,
I wouldn't pay it.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.446
I'd go to court.
Yeah, you're paying it.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.780
No, I ain't paying it.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.198
Good night.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.117
Put your seatbelt on, Si.

05:27.243 --> 05:28.827
Put your seatbelt on before
you get another ticket.

05:28.953 --> 05:29.995
Don't get another ticket.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.341
Are you ready to party?

05:42.467 --> 05:46.011
¶ We're gonna party
if we get the lights ¶

05:46.137 --> 05:47.137
Oh!

05:48.389 --> 05:49.681
This is actually really fun.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.266
All right, hand me
another strand.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.727
Make sure you spell
"anniversary" right.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.145
I think they need
to go higher, babe.

05:55.271 --> 05:56.730
I can't go any higher.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.816
I asked for my family to help me

05:59.942 --> 06:02.652
throw this huge 25th
wedding anniversary
for my parents.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.571
And it's going to be awesome.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.457
Why don't we let Reed...
He's taller than me.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.492
Let him do it.
No, Jep.
That's dangerous.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.785
Get on your tippy toes.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.161
Oh, that's not dangerous.

06:11.287 --> 06:12.954
It's pretty difficult

06:13.081 --> 06:14.664
getting all
the Robertson family
on the same page.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.458
But if you have free labor,

06:16.584 --> 06:17.959
you can't expect the best.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.629
These pop really...

06:21.714 --> 06:23.048
Oh!

06:23.174 --> 06:24.549
Easily.

06:24.675 --> 06:25.675
Oh, God.

06:25.802 --> 06:26.843
At this point, I'm just hoping

06:26.969 --> 06:28.637
no one gets seriously injured.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.472
Hey, hey, hey.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.140
Mom.
I brought y'all
some snacks.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.518
You're not supposed to be here.
What are you doing?

06:34.644 --> 06:37.729
I just thought y'all might be
getting hungry, so I wanted to

06:37.855 --> 06:39.815
bring y'all some snacks.
Korie, it's, like, 3:00.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.817
Quit snooping.
I'm not snooping.
I'm just coming

06:41.943 --> 06:44.194
to just check on y'all.
You are snooping.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.029
No, I was not trying to snoop.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.275
I was trying to be hospitable
and, like, contribute...

06:48.324 --> 06:49.699
That's your lie voice.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.326
That is your lie voice.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.577
That's my... I don't...

06:52.703 --> 06:53.703
I don't have a lie voice.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.917
Like lights and everything?
You like the lights?

06:59.043 --> 07:00.752
You should hang them
a little bit higher.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.212
I told you.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.630
The lights are too low.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.715
Don't get hurt decorating
for my party.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.045
I don't have a lie voice.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.679
I was trying to be helpful.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.390
Okay, I might've been snooping

07:13.516 --> 07:15.308
just a little bit.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.352
Okay, all right, that's enough.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.979
I'm excited.
Thanks.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.272
Sorry, guys.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.858
Little sneaky...
Little sneaky snake.

07:22.984 --> 07:26.111
Ugh! My "calfs" are cramping.
You all right?

07:26.237 --> 07:28.530
Quit.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.241
How many Robertsons does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

07:35.997 --> 07:39.166
Why is cheese better
once you grate it?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.667
When you grate it yourself,

07:40.793 --> 07:42.544
and then you buy it
already grated,

07:42.670 --> 07:44.296
it ain't worth a rip.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.622
If you take the whole block

07:45.631 --> 07:47.424
and just gnaw a piece
of it off...

07:47.550 --> 07:49.092
it's not as good

07:49.218 --> 07:51.138
as if you grate the same block.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.888
'Cause when you grate it,
it covers your whole tummy.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.097
All right, boys.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.223
You're late, Si.
I know.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.683
You're way late.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.186
Hey, you ain't paid
that ticket yet, right?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.896
Nope.

08:01.022 --> 08:01.855
Whatcha got?

08:01.981 --> 08:03.565
Uh-oh.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.108
The reason I was late,

08:05.234 --> 08:08.278
okay, is I went and took
photographs

08:08.404 --> 08:10.447
of the scene of the crime.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.823
Which there were no crime.

08:11.949 --> 08:14.576
This is just pictures
of the road.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.287
Hey, look.
I watch my fair share
of<i> Law & Order,</i>

08:17.413 --> 08:19.748
so when it comes to the law
and legal stuff,

08:19.874 --> 08:21.082
I got this.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.168
That is exactly

08:23.294 --> 08:25.378
where your truck was parked.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.047
What is this mystery picture?

08:27.173 --> 08:28.453
And I'm gonna do you one better.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.758
You don't have to pay
the ticket.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.510
Did you spill something
on the pictures?

08:31.636 --> 08:34.262
Yeah, for example,
"Judge, I object!"

08:34.388 --> 08:35.847
We're gonna go down there,
and I'm gonna fight it.

08:35.973 --> 08:37.265
"You can't handle the proof."

08:37.391 --> 08:38.683
I'm gonna be your lawyer.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.268
"Five-minute recess,
Your Honor."

08:40.394 --> 08:41.228
And this is your evidence?

08:41.354 --> 08:42.896
That's part of it.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.898
Look, at this rate,
it ain't gonna be long

08:45.024 --> 08:46.983
I'll be promoted to Judge Judy

08:47.109 --> 08:49.528
and executioner.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.238
Hey, here's my argument
to the judge.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.364
All right,
let me hear your argument.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.782
Oh, I gotta hear this.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.668
First thing, you see
any parking signs there?

08:55.743 --> 08:56.785
Nope.
Okay,

08:56.911 --> 08:58.954
since there are no white lines

08:59.080 --> 09:01.206
on either side of that road,

09:01.332 --> 09:04.000
okay, I submit to you there,
Your Honor,

09:04.126 --> 09:06.044
there is no shoulder.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.921
He might have a point.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.130
It isn't a shoulder.
It's a ditch.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.507
That is true.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.175
I've been parking there
for 20 years,

09:12.301 --> 09:14.970
and that sets
a "presidents."

09:15.096 --> 09:16.846
"Precedent."

09:16.973 --> 09:18.640
One of the first signs

09:18.766 --> 09:21.206
that you may be on the
wrong side of an argument

09:21.269 --> 09:23.937
is if you find yourself
agreeing with Si.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.397
You vote for the president.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.524
No.
You set a precedent.

09:27.650 --> 09:28.942
Yeah. President.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.068
No.

09:30.194 --> 09:32.654
However, every once in a while,

09:32.780 --> 09:35.490
he has a favorable argument.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.866
Precedent.
President.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.326
Precedent.
President.

09:38.452 --> 09:39.661
Precedent.
Press-eh-dent.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.204
Precedent.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.914
That's what I said...
president.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.744
I'm feeling good about it.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.128
But so far,

09:48.254 --> 09:50.255
this is not one of those times.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.674
Si, I'm not sure
I want you representing me

09:52.800 --> 09:54.593
in a court of law.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.178
Hey, I object.
Why are you banging
on the table?

09:57.305 --> 09:58.597
You're not the judge.
You don't have the gavel.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.056
No.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.600
I think I'll just pay
the ticket,

10:01.726 --> 10:03.393
and we'll go from there.

10:03.519 --> 10:04.936
Hey, I'll take care of it.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.396
I know somebody
down at the courthouse.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.981
Hey.
Tell you what.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.525
You can come,
but if it all goes south,

10:10.651 --> 10:12.193
just plead insanity.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.154
And I guarantee you
that'll work.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.405
Agree.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.740
I object!

10:24.332 --> 10:28.209
¶ I'm just cooking up hotdogs
in the kitchen ¶

10:28.336 --> 10:30.503
Oh, my goodness, Rowdy.
Look at Uncle Alan.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.381
Wow.
That mustache is tragic.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.591
Look at Jep.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.801
He's tiny.
Holy cow.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.596
Rowdy is our new son.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.931
We met him last year in April.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.059
I was actually speaking
at adoption fundraiser

10:44.185 --> 10:46.227
and found out that there
was this little boy

10:46.354 --> 10:48.188
that needed a home.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.024
We met him and fell in love
with him immediately

10:51.150 --> 10:52.734
and invited him into our family.

10:52.860 --> 10:53.860
And here he is.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.614
I don't understand.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.075
Kids are doing a party,
and we're doing all the work.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.535
We're the one that's planning
the party for y'all.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.537
All you're doing
is just cooking a meal.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.304
I was a little bit nervous
about meeting my...
my new family

11:07.375 --> 11:09.415
'cause where I came from,
I had no siblings.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.300
I was just the only child
in my family.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.838
Since I was the only child
and I only had one parent,

11:13.964 --> 11:15.757
I never got to out of state,

11:15.883 --> 11:17.676
so this is also my first time
to be out of state.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.344
It was awesome.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.721
You're going to be
in our family forever.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.015
Oh, my... Look.
Look at Daddy.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.221
Can you believe that's Dad?

11:25.267 --> 11:26.518
No, it looks nothing like him.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.936
Hey...

11:28.062 --> 11:29.729
Hey, Rowdy,
go check the laundry.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.564
I think I heard the...
the buzzer go off.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.891
Okay.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.567
Willie, look at the date.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.735
"1-11-'92."

11:35.861 --> 11:37.445
I remember that day.

11:37.571 --> 11:38.822
We got married in '92.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.281
It's 2016.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.075
Hang on.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.660
Look, six minus two...
Probably should be...

11:43.786 --> 11:45.995
is four.
17 minus two.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.330
No, six minus two is four.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.665
No, seven...
So that's 20...

11:48.791 --> 11:50.083
I'm saying 17 minus two is five.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.668
Which would be next year.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.462
It's not 25th.
It's our 24th.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.507
I think the 25th anniversary
debacle

11:57.633 --> 11:58.758
came from me

11:58.884 --> 12:00.593
'cause I somehow...

12:00.720 --> 12:02.262
In that year, I just thought

12:02.388 --> 12:03.888
it was 25.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.307
I got a little confused.
I mentioned to Korie...

12:06.434 --> 12:08.435
She just went with it.
You were like...

12:08.561 --> 12:10.241
Are you trying to somehow
blame this on me?

12:11.731 --> 12:12.731
I don't think it's a big deal.
We just go...

12:12.857 --> 12:14.149
What? Okay, this is a...

12:14.275 --> 12:16.025
"Sorry."

12:16.152 --> 12:18.862
Willie, they've got, like,
a huge cake coming.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.155
How do you know exactly
what they're doing?
They've got...

12:20.281 --> 12:21.197
I thought it was a surprise.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.323
I have an informant.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.450
Who?

12:23.451 --> 12:24.909
Rowdy.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.453
You said, "This is our 25th.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.163
We need to do something big."

12:28.289 --> 12:30.123
And I was like, "Okay, hey,
we need to do something big.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.541
It's our 25th."

12:31.667 --> 12:33.827
You just heard
"Let's do something big"

12:33.878 --> 12:36.004
and just went with it.
Right, that's pretty much
all I heard, yeah.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.547
Okay, let's just shake,
like, we just...

12:37.673 --> 12:39.549
we pretend it's our 25th.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.675
'Cause if I don't tell,
then you're not gonna tell.

12:41.677 --> 12:42.802
Promise?

12:42.928 --> 12:44.053
Slide.
Okay.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.472
Slide it.
Okay.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.015
That's it.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.892
All right.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.560
Well, I know what I'm getting
you now for our anniversary.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.604
What?
A calculator.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.564
In the criminal justice system,

12:54.690 --> 12:56.691
the people are "representeted"

12:56.817 --> 12:58.860
by two important groups...

12:58.986 --> 13:02.071
the police,
who write the stupid tickets.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.408
Then you got the lawyers
that protect the innocent.

13:05.534 --> 13:08.411
Even their dumb nephews.

13:08.537 --> 13:12.957
- These are their stories, Jack.
- <i> ¶¶</i>

13:13.083 --> 13:14.334
<i>¶¶</i>

13:16.670 --> 13:18.588
Dun dun!

13:20.216 --> 13:21.896
Guys, take your hat off.
Take your hat off.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.551
- Huh? What?
- Take your hat off.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.677
That's good enough.
I've heard enough.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.346
200 post calls.
Have a seat.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.556
Si, this isn't where
you pay the ticket.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.225
I got us a hearing.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.477
What? Si?

13:34.230 --> 13:36.189
Look, when somebody tells you

13:36.315 --> 13:38.191
that they're going to take care
of a parking ticket,

13:38.317 --> 13:40.735
that usually means they're
going to pay for it.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.035
We're all right.
That doesn't mean

13:49.161 --> 13:51.746
they're going to be
your counsel pro bono.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.040
Next case, Robertson.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.503
Si, what are you doing?
Si.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.129
The way I see it,

14:00.256 --> 14:02.298
Si could either wind up in jail,

14:02.424 --> 14:04.008
in contempt of court,

14:04.134 --> 14:08.680
or somehow
he could miraculously win.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.139
Bear with me, Your Honor.

14:12.434 --> 14:15.395
I gotta do a bunch of talking.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.481
Either way I'm up
for seeing both.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.942
Your Honor,
this is a simple case

14:21.068 --> 14:23.403
of clear set president.

14:25.614 --> 14:26.614
"President"?

14:26.657 --> 14:27.657
Yeah, "president."

14:27.741 --> 14:29.617
We got a ticket.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.160
But anyway,
I've been going there

14:31.287 --> 14:33.580
for, like, 28 to 25 years,

14:33.706 --> 14:35.415
parking on the side of road,

14:35.541 --> 14:37.667
fishing, okay?

14:37.793 --> 14:39.711
So the presidents has been set.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.046
I'm gonna find you guilty.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.591
You got 19 years free.
This year you didn't.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.426
Your Honor, I object.

14:46.552 --> 14:51.014
Guilty. $75 plus cost.
Have a seat.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.349
Oh, you talking about
a travesty?

14:53.475 --> 14:55.955
He didn't even listen
to my closing argument.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.821
All right, thank you,
Your Honor.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.149
I thought that went well.
No.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.776
I'm telling you, boys,
our judicial system is broken.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.486
Can't win them all.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.447
You can't win one.
No.

15:07.573 --> 15:11.492
Hey, this is<i> Law & Order,</i>
okay,<i> SV-P.U.!</i>

15:12.620 --> 15:13.912
It stinks.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.663
Si, you didn't have a case.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.624
Oh, what are you talkin' about,
didn't have a case?

15:17.750 --> 15:21.252
Owe $90 for wasting
two hours of my life.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.380
No, hey, you do expect to get
my bill through the mail.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.757
Your bill?

15:25.883 --> 15:27.467
Yeah, you ain't even got
my bill yet.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.344
Si, you got a ticket!

15:29.470 --> 15:30.470
What?

15:32.681 --> 15:34.098
This ain't happening.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.686
No!

15:38.812 --> 15:40.313
N-No.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.440
No. Hey.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.400
We're fixin' to pull
back in there, boys.

15:44.526 --> 15:47.111
Pull back in there, Si.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.477
I got another one to fight.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.911
¶¶

16:05.339 --> 16:07.090
I can't wait
for y'all to see it.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.092
You didn't have to make it
a big deal.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.802
It's only our 25th.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.680
Okay, everybody.
They're here.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.264
Korie, we're past the bar now.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.016
Hey!
Hey.

16:17.142 --> 16:20.436
- A party? For me?
- Aww!

16:20.562 --> 16:21.562
This is insane.

16:21.689 --> 16:22.689
That's so sweet.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.565
W-We're not...

16:24.692 --> 16:26.025
We're not being dishonest.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.236
It's just a big party.
Well...

16:28.362 --> 16:29.882
We thought it was
our 25th anniversary.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.614
Yeah, we weren't dishonest
at first.
Yeah.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.742
Now we're being a bit dishonest.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.285
Korie, you are the most
incredible woman

16:36.412 --> 16:37.662
in the world...

16:37.788 --> 16:39.622
Thank you. Wow.
To have survived

16:39.748 --> 16:41.874
25 years of that.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.919
I mean, they worked so hard,

16:45.045 --> 16:46.713
and they're trying to do
something really special
for us,

16:46.839 --> 16:48.965
so I don't wanna ruin that.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.342
We have a surprise for y'all.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.470
We have two more guests
joining us.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.305
It's John Luke and Mary Kate!

16:56.432 --> 16:57.807
<i>Hi!</i>

16:57.933 --> 16:59.350
<i>How's it going?</i>

16:59.476 --> 17:01.310
I wish y'all were here.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.187
<i>Yeah, we're sorry we couldn't
be there in person.</i>

17:03.313 --> 17:05.153
<i>Yeah. We miss y'all.
We miss y'all.</i>

17:05.190 --> 17:07.358
- Can they see us?
- Yes.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.610
<i>- Happy 25th!</i>
- Thank you!

17:09.737 --> 17:12.071
I feel like I'm on the spaceship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

17:12.197 --> 17:13.865
John Luke, are you making
good grades?

17:13.991 --> 17:15.908
<i>Uh, we'll talk about that later.</i>

17:17.161 --> 17:18.786
That's no!

17:18.912 --> 17:21.372
Really, this is a big deal
to plan this big of a party.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.541
I mean, it's weird
that we have children

17:23.667 --> 17:25.793
that actually are old enough
to do that.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.588
Like, they're actually adults.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.339
We have children
that are married.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.883
I know.
That's crazy.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.089
Again, dates.
She forgets these things.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.485
All right,
we have one more surprise.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.320
I present to you

17:52.446 --> 17:55.615
a Love Story."

17:55.741 --> 17:57.283
Aw.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.910
Isn't that Dolly Parton?

17:59.036 --> 18:00.369
Hey, lookie there!

18:00.496 --> 18:02.622
"It was 1981

18:02.748 --> 18:04.707
"when young Willie and Korie
met each other

18:04.833 --> 18:07.335
at Camp Ch-Yo-Ca,
and it was love at first sight."

18:07.461 --> 18:09.712
My name is Willie.
What is your name?

18:09.838 --> 18:11.547
You smell funny.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.219
"Two years later, in 1983,

18:16.345 --> 18:17.720
"Willie got some deodorant

18:17.846 --> 18:20.306
and asked Korie to come
to his family fish fry."

18:20.432 --> 18:22.558
How do you like your mussels?
What muscles?

18:25.687 --> 18:26.687
What is this, a roast?

18:26.772 --> 18:28.272
Or is this the story
of our life?

18:28.398 --> 18:30.858
"It didn't look like
young Willie had a chance,

18:30.984 --> 18:34.821
"but eight years later,
in October of 1991,

18:34.947 --> 18:37.115
"Willie went from popping
his guns

18:37.241 --> 18:38.699
to popping the question."

18:40.744 --> 18:41.984
Korie, will you marry me?

18:41.995 --> 18:43.412
Of course I will.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.331
Of course she will.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.042
I'm the luckiest man
in the world!

18:50.838 --> 18:54.090
"And in January of '92
they were married."

18:54.216 --> 18:57.426
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.720
Don't do it for real,
because that's just weird.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.307
Yeah!

19:05.185 --> 19:08.187
Hold on! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.856
No, no, hold it.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.941
Si!
Look, I ain't
no "mathemagician,"

19:12.067 --> 19:16.654
but, hey, 1992 to 2016...

19:16.780 --> 19:18.281
Si, will you just shut up?

19:18.407 --> 19:19.782
We're trying to have
a party here.
Hey, look.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.742
It's your 24th, dummy.

19:21.869 --> 19:22.910
Willie made me do it.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.495
We... We mis-added.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.372
Everybody's not good in math.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.708
Korie, kudos to you
for putting up with that idiot

19:28.834 --> 19:30.209
for 24 years.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.590
Now, let the party begin!

19:37.259 --> 19:39.302
The plan would've gone great

19:39.428 --> 19:42.096
if it wasn't
for old man Witherspoon
over there,

19:42.222 --> 19:43.764
who figured out the whole deal.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.142
We had it.
They were totally fooled.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.268
All right, guys,

19:47.352 --> 19:49.187
thank you all for coming.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.063
We were a little off
on the year.

19:51.190 --> 19:51.981
We apologize.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.816
It is our 24th.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.302
Thank you, Si,
for revealing that.

19:57.905 --> 19:58.988
Twenty-four years...

19:59.114 --> 20:00.406
that's something to celebrate.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.532
It's just like 25

20:01.617 --> 20:03.117
except for one year less.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.744
True.

20:04.870 --> 20:05.828
All right,
we'll have a word of prayer

20:05.954 --> 20:06.954
and thank you guys.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.331
Father, we're so thankful

20:08.457 --> 20:09.999
for all the things
You've given us.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.834
Thank You for Korie
and this relationship

20:11.960 --> 20:14.462
and the wonderful children
that have come out of it.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.006
And, Father, we're thankful
for all our marriages here.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.257
Through Him we pray.
Amen.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.842
Amen.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.761
<i>With our family,</i>

20:21.887 --> 20:24.430
<i>an anniversary is so much
more than just a date.</i>

20:24.556 --> 20:26.807
<i>It's a chance to look back
on the reasons,</i>

20:26.934 --> 20:28.476
<i>both big and small,</i>

20:28.602 --> 20:30.811
<i>why you fell in love
in the first place.</i>

20:30.938 --> 20:33.773
<i>But what we celebrate the most
is each other.</i>

20:33.899 --> 20:36.442
<i>It doesn't matter
if it's been 25 years</i>

20:36.568 --> 20:38.986
<i>or, in this case, 24 years,</i>

20:39.112 --> 20:41.280
<i>what's most important is family,</i>

20:41.406 --> 20:43.866
<i>because family is timeless.</i>

20:43.992 --> 20:45.409
Hey, Dad, what did you
end up getting Mom

20:45.535 --> 20:46.911
for y'all's anniversary?

20:47.037 --> 20:48.287
We'll talk about it later.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.458
Ohhh!
Look at that.
You wanna go to the movies?

20:52.584 --> 20:54.168
You saved these?

20:54.294 --> 20:55.294
Remember when
we went and saw<i> Ghost?</i>

20:55.420 --> 20:56.629
Tickets to<i> Ghost.</i>

20:56.755 --> 20:58.297
You saved these all these years?

20:58.423 --> 21:00.299
All these years.
Oh, baby.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.550
Twenty-four years.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.469
That's so sweet.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.835
That movie was really romantic.

21:04.930 --> 21:05.930
Mm-hm.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.556
Especially when you cried.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.141
I was not crying.
It was sweet.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.601
You were.
My nose was running.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.436
That's how I knew
you were the man for me.

21:12.562 --> 21:13.802
I've got allergies.
