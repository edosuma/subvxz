00:04.402 --> 00:06.952
A possible Red Flag prisoner
is in our offices.

00:06.955 --> 00:09.240
Cameron said that he and Nina
had him subdued,

00:09.241 --> 00:11.042
and now they're
bringing him here.

00:11.076 --> 00:13.544
I thought Sullivan wanted
an approach and evaluate.

00:13.578 --> 00:16.793
See if the man is an Alpha
or any Red Flag connections.

00:16.828 --> 00:18.769
Clearly things went
another way.

00:18.804 --> 00:20.851
So we still don't know
what his ability is?

00:20.885 --> 00:22.456
No.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.459
Well, it's a good thing we
got this thing up and running.

00:27.203 --> 00:29.607

00:29.641 --> 00:31.178
That's not your birthday,
is it?

00:31.213 --> 00:33.649
Super bowl III.

00:33.683 --> 00:36.288
Jets beat the Colts 16-7.

00:36.323 --> 00:37.623
Yeah, but you couldn't
have been old enough

00:37.657 --> 00:38.957
to have been there.

00:38.991 --> 00:40.191
I was six months old.

00:40.225 --> 00:41.496
I even have a photo
of my dad holding me

00:41.530 --> 00:42.730
while he was watching
the game,

00:42.764 --> 00:45.233
so that makes me
a Jets fan for life, baby.

00:45.269 --> 00:46.368
And we're coming.

00:46.403 --> 00:48.036
You see what
we did last year, right?

00:48.070 --> 00:49.337
Yeah, that's football,
right, Bill?

00:49.372 --> 00:51.706
Uh, yeah, football.

00:51.741 --> 00:55.276
Anyway, so we got bulletproof,
polarized glass.

00:55.310 --> 00:58.179
We've got industrial-grade
surge suppressors,

00:58.213 --> 01:00.280
fire-retardant foam.

01:00.315 --> 01:02.116
And the best part

01:02.150 --> 01:04.086
is we got
an emergency lockdown,

01:04.120 --> 01:05.855
the whole office.

01:05.890 --> 01:08.192
So the windows, doors,
everything shut.

01:08.226 --> 01:09.962
Now, if only we can get D.O.D.
to buy us a new car.

01:09.997 --> 01:11.064
Can they do that?

01:11.098 --> 01:14.199
Oh, gosh, Bill,
I-I don't know.

01:14.234 --> 01:17.101
I've allowed this to go so far
beyond what I envisioned

01:17.136 --> 01:18.404
for all of us.

01:18.438 --> 01:19.505
Doc, you got to get
over that.

01:19.539 --> 01:20.872
We're not longer
just your patients.

01:20.907 --> 01:22.073

You got to go
with the flow, right?

01:27.181 --> 01:28.647
Isn't that what
you always tell me?

01:28.682 --> 01:30.716
Look, ever since that mess
with Jonas Englin,

01:30.750 --> 01:32.718
I've lost my ability--
I'm here, right?

01:32.752 --> 01:34.853
I'm good with it.
You're good with it, so--

01:34.888 --> 01:36.254
No, I'm not all
that good with it.

01:36.289 --> 01:37.589
It's not who you are,

01:37.623 --> 01:39.758
and the D.O.D.
isn't happy either.

01:39.793 --> 01:41.227
Actually, I'm trying
to figure out a way

01:41.261 --> 01:42.661
to get the ability back.

01:42.696 --> 01:44.464
You're a fine
investigator, Bill,

01:44.498 --> 01:46.333
but as far as
the government's concerned,

01:46.367 --> 01:48.034
we are a group of Alphas.

01:48.068 --> 01:50.536
Well, you're not an Alpha.
You're still here, right?

01:50.571 --> 01:54.006
- And besides, Doc...
- Huh?

01:54.040 --> 01:56.108
Jeannie and I are thinking
about renovating the kitchen.

01:56.142 --> 01:58.509

keep those checks coming.

01:58.543 --> 01:59.944

01:59.978 --> 02:01.612

They ignored my checklist.

02:01.646 --> 02:03.080
I made a detailed list.

02:03.114 --> 02:05.316

and telepathy blockers

02:05.350 --> 02:07.920

gun turrets.

02:07.954 --> 02:09.520

don't exist.

02:09.555 --> 02:11.524
Yeah, I like
the old Bill better.

02:11.558 --> 02:13.326
You'd take things seriously,

02:13.360 --> 02:15.028
and your veins would pop out
when things weren't right,

02:15.062 --> 02:16.295

02:16.330 --> 02:18.431
Why aren't your veins
popping out anymore?

02:18.465 --> 02:20.033
I don't have to worry
about that anymore.

02:20.068 --> 02:21.201
Why are you still here, then?

02:21.236 --> 02:22.603
You're not even
an Alpha anymore.

02:22.637 --> 02:24.905

you'd miss me, right?

- Okay. I hear them.

Kern off to us.

05:05.932 --> 05:07.733
Guy's an obstetrician.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.634

all the time.

in us.

Well, he's our shrink.

05:26.085 --> 05:28.687
Why, is it because, um...

05:28.722 --> 05:30.556
because I'm divorced

that I'd be bad for you,

Um, Doc found something.
We got a meeting.

06:08.830 --> 06:10.864
Yeah, we're on our way.

06:32.385 --> 06:34.553
How can Kern be blind?

06:34.587 --> 06:36.221
Because
he has no optic nerve.

06:36.255 --> 06:40.692
The MRI revealed something,
uh, well, pretty interesting.

06:40.726 --> 06:42.960
It's as if
they never developed.

06:42.995 --> 06:44.996
So, even if his eyes
were functioning properly,

06:45.030 --> 06:46.364
as they appear to be,

06:46.398 --> 06:48.299
no visual data
would ever reach his brain.

06:48.334 --> 06:49.834
Which is why
I couldn't push him.

06:49.869 --> 06:51.302
He couldn't see me.

Look, when things got ugly,
that guy dodged around his desk,

06:53.705 --> 06:54.972
and he ran straight
for the door.

06:55.007 --> 06:56.574
There is no way he's blind.

06:56.608 --> 06:59.878
Well, unless he's an Alpha,
which I have some ideas about,

06:59.912 --> 07:01.980
uh, but I need to run
a few more tests.

07:02.014 --> 07:03.748
So we're talking
about a blind Alpha

- Yeah. No, it's not,

07:32.713 --> 07:34.548
Yeah, and the answer's no.

07:34.582 --> 07:37.350
To get back to our case,
the reason Dr. Kern is here--

07:37.385 --> 07:39.452
D.O.D. suspects that he's been
doing some sort of research,

07:39.486 --> 07:42.388
and they are hoping
that we can figure out why.

07:42.423 --> 07:46.459

into the cell phone

10:06.412 --> 10:08.846
I just would like
to speak with him.

10:11.550 --> 10:13.083
Okay, whatever.

10:13.118 --> 10:15.219
Let me tell you something...

10:15.253 --> 10:16.720
Happiness is a warm gun.

10:16.755 --> 10:19.190
And mine is a Sig 226.
You got me?

10:19.224 --> 10:20.257
I want my lawyer.

10:20.292 --> 10:21.558
Yeah, and I want
a Reuben sandwich.

10:21.593 --> 10:23.327
I'll have my lawyer
pick you up one.

10:23.361 --> 10:24.728
Well, unfortunately,
Doctor Kern,

10:24.763 --> 10:26.998
you're being detained because
of suspected involvement

10:27.032 --> 10:29.200
with a terrorist organization.

10:29.235 --> 10:32.036
The only organization
I belong to is the A.M.A.

10:32.070 --> 10:34.839
So, what, Alphas, ability,
Red Flag--

10:34.873 --> 10:37.008
that means nothing to you?

10:39.945 --> 10:41.813
Bill, will you take
the cuffs off,

10:41.847 --> 10:44.715
stand him up,
and have him face the glass?

10:53.224 --> 10:56.092
Get up slowly.
Keep your arms up.

10:56.126 --> 10:57.660
Turn around and face
the wall, please.

10:57.694 --> 10:59.729
What is this,
a cavity check?

11:08.637 --> 11:10.972
That's just as I thought...

11:11.007 --> 11:13.442
sonar, echolocation.

11:13.476 --> 11:16.111
- So he's like a bat?
- Or a dolphin.

11:16.146 --> 11:18.246
You can sit down now.

11:18.281 --> 11:22.183
So that's how you see...

11:22.218 --> 11:23.752
Very interesting.

11:23.786 --> 11:25.587
You have no optic nerves.

11:25.621 --> 11:28.590
However, the audio-processing
capabilities

11:28.624 --> 11:30.225
of your brain,
your voice box,

11:30.259 --> 11:33.061
the chambers
in your sinus passages

11:33.095 --> 11:35.163
are all significantly enhanced.

11:35.197 --> 11:37.132
You're an Alpha.

11:37.166 --> 11:38.433
But of course
you already know that.

11:38.467 --> 11:40.668
This isn't going
to end well.

11:40.702 --> 11:43.037
Is that a threat?

11:47.342 --> 11:50.311
Hey, Cley, Rosen and I are going
to keep working with him,

11:50.345 --> 11:52.513
and Rachel's nosing around
through what we found

11:52.547 --> 11:54.014
in his office.

11:54.049 --> 11:55.449
Yeah, Rosen thinks
that he's probably said

11:55.483 --> 11:56.817
about as much
as he's going to,

11:56.851 --> 11:59.620
so why don't you come
scoop him up?

11:59.655 --> 12:02.590
All right, what,
two hours?

12:02.624 --> 12:04.358
From Knoxville?

12:04.392 --> 12:08.195
All right,
have a safe flight.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.843
[Knock at door]
Doc, can we talk?

12:23.877 --> 12:25.611
I'm a bit busy, Cameron,
can we--

12:25.645 --> 12:27.046
No, it won't take long.

12:27.080 --> 12:31.382
Look, I just wanted to say,
um, me and Nina...

12:31.417 --> 12:33.584
If you just give us
a little space

12:33.619 --> 12:35.520
and let us figure some things
out for ourselves...

12:35.554 --> 12:38.556
I'm only trying to look out
for the both of you.

12:38.590 --> 12:41.059
Well, I get that,
but we're adults.

12:41.093 --> 12:44.796
We get to make our own mistakes,
so, please, just let it go.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.565
I'd like to,

12:46.599 --> 12:48.533
but as your psychiatrist
and your employer,

12:48.568 --> 12:50.134
I don't think I can do that.

12:50.169 --> 12:52.137
And I don't think you're in
a place to make that decision.

12:52.171 --> 12:53.872
Am I interrupting?
I'm always interrupting.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.241
I'm sorry,
but I found something

12:55.275 --> 12:57.243
in the box
I was going through.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.244
It's important.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.984
Here, look at these.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.822
"Building blocks
for a better baby."

13:10.857 --> 13:13.024
Yeah, they're vitamins
for pregnant women.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.293
I decided to break one open
and take a look inside--

13:15.328 --> 13:17.095
you know,
really take a look.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.165
Rachel, what did you find?

13:20.199 --> 13:22.033
DNA...

13:22.068 --> 13:25.169
active human DNA
inside the vitamins.

13:25.204 --> 13:27.238
Active human DNA

13:27.272 --> 13:29.841
introduced
into a developing fetus

13:29.875 --> 13:31.642
could cause
multiple birth defects,

13:31.677 --> 13:32.843
severe mutations.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.213
Yeah, that's what
I was worried about.

13:35.247 --> 13:37.748
Hold on a second.
I smell blood...

13:39.051 --> 13:40.384
in the hallway.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.758
Nina.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.460
It just started bleeding.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.462
I haven't had one of these
since I was a kid.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.630
Oh, gosh, look up.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.632
Are you dizzy?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.468
- No, it's okay.
- Headache or anything?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.706
It was just
a few broken capillaries,

14:00.741 --> 14:04.410
nothing serious,
but were you picking?

14:06.013 --> 14:07.914
I don't pick.

14:07.949 --> 14:10.651
Here, take this.

14:10.685 --> 14:12.520
You'll be fine.
Just clean it up, okay?

14:12.554 --> 14:14.722
Yeah. Good.

14:35.043 --> 14:37.811
[Heart beating]

14:37.845 --> 14:41.415
Are you aware you have
mitral valve prolapse--

14:41.449 --> 14:44.185
three millimeters
of displacement?

14:44.219 --> 14:47.355
You just did an ultrasound
of my chest.

14:47.389 --> 14:48.956
You should get
that looked at.

14:48.991 --> 14:53.929
Well, I have a heart exam
twice a year.

14:53.963 --> 14:56.765
I'm monitoring it,
but, uh...

14:56.799 --> 14:58.500
thank you
for your concern, though.

14:58.534 --> 15:01.136
Like you, I took an oath...

15:01.171 --> 15:03.272
do no harm.

15:03.306 --> 15:05.841
I may be an Alpha,
but I'm a doctor first.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.476
I hope you'll keep that
in mind.

15:07.511 --> 15:09.511
No harm.

15:09.546 --> 15:12.581
What kind of doctor
gives active human DNA

15:12.615 --> 15:14.884
to pregnant women?

15:14.918 --> 15:17.119
Someone who cares
about the future.

15:17.154 --> 15:18.587
Whose future?

15:21.291 --> 15:23.126
You're aware of Renestrin--

15:23.160 --> 15:26.964
new drug that allegedly
prevents birth defects?

15:26.998 --> 15:28.566
But what it really does

15:28.600 --> 15:30.301
is interferes
with the fetal development

15:30.335 --> 15:31.635
of more evolved children.

15:31.670 --> 15:33.270
What you're really saying

15:33.305 --> 15:36.341
is it prevents babies
from being born as Alphas.

15:36.375 --> 15:39.778
Consider my special vitamins
the counteragent.

15:39.812 --> 15:43.915
Are you planning to distribute
your counteragent

15:43.949 --> 15:46.584
all by yourself?

15:46.618 --> 15:50.288
Can any of your team
read minds?

15:55.226 --> 15:56.426
No.

15:56.461 --> 15:58.128
Well, I guess
there's some questions

15:58.162 --> 16:01.564
that aren't meant
to be answered.

16:01.599 --> 16:05.701
Dr. Rosen, I know what's going
to happen next.

16:05.735 --> 16:07.870
Men with guns
will whisk me away

16:07.904 --> 16:09.772
to some government facility.

16:09.806 --> 16:12.242
That would be
a tragic, tragic error.

16:12.277 --> 16:13.911
Well, I'm afraid
the real tragedy

16:13.945 --> 16:17.415
is you choosing to join
a terrorist organization.

16:17.449 --> 16:19.683
Red Flag isn't as monolithic
as you think it is.

16:19.718 --> 16:21.018
Well, regardless
of its scope,

16:21.052 --> 16:24.154
you and your friends
tried to assassinate me.

16:24.189 --> 16:26.156
Fringe elements, radicals,

16:26.191 --> 16:28.059
not representative
of the mainstream.

16:28.093 --> 16:30.595
You know, it's amazing
how often people use that term--

16:30.629 --> 16:32.030
"fringe elements."

16:32.064 --> 16:33.464
Hmm.

16:33.499 --> 16:36.334
Occurs to me
that the I.R.A.,

16:36.368 --> 16:38.870
P.L.O., K.K.K.--

16:38.904 --> 16:41.006
all fringe elements

16:41.040 --> 16:44.176
whose very existence
depends upon the support

16:44.210 --> 16:47.380
of their mainstream
fellow travelers.

16:47.414 --> 16:50.750
I've read
your field reports, Doctor.

16:50.785 --> 16:55.255
You advocate a future
where Alphas and normal humans

16:55.289 --> 16:57.324
cooperate for the common good.

16:57.358 --> 17:00.427
That's the future I want.

17:00.461 --> 17:03.797
We should be working together,
comparing notes.

17:03.831 --> 17:06.934
You're inviting me
to join Red Flag?

17:06.968 --> 17:10.036
I'm afraid I don't meet
their entry requirements.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.038
I see a time coming soon

17:12.071 --> 17:15.273
where the unenhanced
will be able to join our cause.

17:15.309 --> 17:18.044
That's where you belong.

Dr. Kern,
if you're willing to disclose

17:24.084 --> 17:27.252
what exactly it is
you're up to,

17:27.287 --> 17:29.488
I'm willing to intervene
on your behalf.

for you, Doctor.

how we break him down?

- Well, he's sonic guy, right?
- Yeah.

Yeah, it's been known to work.

19:33.221 --> 19:34.755
Just remember, anything
we force him to listen to

19:34.789 --> 19:36.123
we got to hear it as well.

- No, not lately.

20:06.719 --> 20:08.220

- Rachel?

21:51.195 --> 21:53.730
Besides, my hearing
is quite good.

21:53.764 --> 21:55.665
The number of heartbeats
on this floor

21:55.700 --> 21:57.467
hasn't changed since I awoke.

21:57.502 --> 21:59.036
How many are you hearing?

21:59.070 --> 22:01.772
Do we really have to play
this ridiculous game?

22:01.807 --> 22:03.107
There are eight.

22:03.141 --> 22:04.676
There have always been eight.

22:04.710 --> 22:07.979
Yours, mine, and the six
members of your team, I assume.

22:08.013 --> 22:10.281
We haven't been
properly introduced.

22:10.316 --> 22:11.616
Dr. Kern,
there are only six of us,

22:11.650 --> 22:13.518
that includes Rachel
and myself.

22:13.552 --> 22:15.887
Plus you, that's seven.

22:18.523 --> 22:20.958
What?

22:23.361 --> 22:25.863
Have things...

22:25.897 --> 22:30.668
Have things gone missing
around your office...

22:30.703 --> 22:32.570
Strange sounds,

22:32.605 --> 22:35.607
computers
turning on randomly,

22:35.641 --> 22:40.477
people sensing someone nearby
without ever seeing anyone?

22:44.081 --> 22:46.215
You have an unwelcome guest.

22:49.186 --> 22:50.953
What are you saying,

22:50.988 --> 22:53.056
That--that Rachel's
been kidnapped

22:53.090 --> 22:56.125
and that the person
is still here in the building?

22:56.159 --> 22:57.960
Let me solve your problem.

22:57.994 --> 23:00.129
Let me help you,
or we're all dead.

23:00.163 --> 23:01.897
Why should I believe
anything you say?

23:01.931 --> 23:03.999
All right, don't.
Don't.

23:04.033 --> 23:06.434
But one member of your team
is down already.

23:06.469 --> 23:10.305
Ignore me,
things will only get worse.

23:18.048 --> 23:20.049
Let me out!

23:20.083 --> 23:22.418
Before it's too late,
let me out!

23:22.453 --> 23:23.687
You need to let me out!

23:23.721 --> 23:26.290
I'm the only one
who can keep us alive.

23:26.324 --> 23:27.625
Don't need to hear that.

23:27.659 --> 23:29.126
I don't trust that guy
for a second.

23:29.161 --> 23:30.728
Look, I searched
the entire office again--

23:30.762 --> 23:32.163
still no Rachel.

23:32.197 --> 23:35.232
And we got nothing to go on
except what Kern is saying.

23:35.267 --> 23:36.533
I can't wait
for Cley to show up

23:36.568 --> 23:37.935
and get this guy out of here.

23:37.969 --> 23:39.237
Not until
we find Rachel.

23:39.271 --> 23:41.739
Yeah, I think we--
we should at least consider

23:41.774 --> 23:43.007
what Kern is saying.

23:43.042 --> 23:44.943
An intruder
would certainly explain

23:44.977 --> 23:47.345
some of the strange things
that have been happening here.

23:47.379 --> 23:48.747
Hey, Doc, earlier today,

23:48.781 --> 23:50.382
I thought I was imagining
something, right?

23:50.416 --> 23:52.184
But I felt that
someone was watching me.

23:52.218 --> 23:54.252
I turned around,
and there was no one there.

23:54.287 --> 23:55.487
Exactly, Bill.

23:55.522 --> 23:57.056
That is called proprioception.

23:57.090 --> 23:58.691
It's one of the ways we have

23:58.725 --> 24:01.127
of processing the million bits
of information

24:01.161 --> 24:02.562
in our environment around us.

24:02.596 --> 24:04.998
Like you said,
if you find yourself in a room

24:05.032 --> 24:06.732
full of people,
you sense something.

24:06.767 --> 24:08.301
Then you feel compelled
to turn around,

24:08.335 --> 24:10.002
and they're looking
right at you.

24:10.037 --> 24:11.870
That's our proprioception
at work.

24:11.905 --> 24:13.739
So our proprioception
says someone's here,

24:13.773 --> 24:15.274
but our eyes say there isn't.

24:15.308 --> 24:18.410
Yes, well, unlike Rachel,

24:18.444 --> 24:20.546
when we're looking
for something,

24:20.580 --> 24:22.815
we rely on our vision.

24:22.849 --> 24:25.885
But vision can be deceptive.

24:31.157 --> 24:32.325
How many dots do you see?

24:32.359 --> 24:33.659
Two.

24:33.694 --> 24:35.861
All right, now hold this
with your right hand.

24:35.895 --> 24:39.966
All right, close your left eye.

24:40.001 --> 24:43.803
Look at this dot and move
the paper slowly towards you.

24:43.838 --> 24:45.405
One of the dots
just disappeared.

24:45.439 --> 24:46.573
Into your blind spot.

24:46.607 --> 24:48.675
You've all heard of one.
We all have one.

24:48.710 --> 24:52.346
It's a hole or gap
in our visual landscape

24:52.380 --> 24:54.682
which exists because of the way
our brains are wired.

24:54.716 --> 24:56.384
And we might be dealing
with an Alpha

24:56.418 --> 24:58.452
who can exploit
this phenomenon.

24:58.486 --> 25:00.721
Okay, let's say that there
is an Alpha here, right,

25:00.755 --> 25:03.523
that does that--
how do they get into that gap?

25:03.558 --> 25:04.558
Bill, I don't know.

25:04.592 --> 25:06.493
They might be able
to send a signal

25:06.527 --> 25:07.727
that swells the optic nerves,

25:07.762 --> 25:10.363
thereby expanding
collectively the blind spot

25:10.398 --> 25:12.432
and move into it
so nobody can see them.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.567
I still don't buy it. I mean,
there's cameras everywhere.

25:14.602 --> 25:16.036
An Alpha might be able
to mess with our brain,

25:16.070 --> 25:17.670
but how does he get past
the cameras?

25:17.705 --> 25:19.873
The cameras are glitched.

25:19.907 --> 25:21.207
Someone's made them glitchy.

25:21.241 --> 25:23.342
There's dropped frames
and time lag.

25:23.377 --> 25:24.844
Enough to get around
without being seen?

25:24.878 --> 25:26.178
Yes, yes.

25:26.213 --> 25:27.913
But it's only our cameras.

25:27.948 --> 25:30.916
It's only the cameras
inside this building.

25:30.950 --> 25:33.652
Yeah, the camera across
the street

25:33.687 --> 25:35.955
looks into this building
every 15 minutes.

25:35.989 --> 25:38.924
And that's why I won't go to the
bathroom at three minutes after

25:38.959 --> 25:41.827
or at 18 or 33 or 48, yeah.
Gary, Gary, Gary, come on.

25:41.861 --> 25:45.264
Okay, watch this.

25:46.233 --> 25:47.833
Who is that woman?

25:47.868 --> 25:50.336
Wait.
Who's that woman?

25:50.370 --> 25:52.204
Hicks, behind you!

25:52.239 --> 25:53.806
Where'd she go?

25:53.841 --> 25:57.376
I can't see her.

25:57.410 --> 25:59.311
Cameron?
Hicks, what happened?

25:59.345 --> 26:01.480
I never even saw her.
This isn't good.

26:01.515 --> 26:02.948
That's a lot of red.

26:02.983 --> 26:06.218
Get a pressure bandage
on that right away.

26:06.253 --> 26:07.987
[Alarm blaring]

26:08.021 --> 26:11.257
Come on, she's activating
the blast door!

26:14.979 --> 26:16.085
Password's been changed.

26:16.086 --> 26:18.438
Well, all the phones aren't working
either or the Internet.

26:18.792 --> 26:20.359
Yeah, and Rachel's missing.
Hicks is on the D.L.

26:20.393 --> 26:23.128
Even if Cley gets here in time,
he couldn't get in.

26:23.163 --> 26:24.463
Don't worry about that now.

26:24.497 --> 26:26.299
Maybe Gary can override
the lock system.

26:26.333 --> 26:27.467
That's worth a try.

26:27.501 --> 26:30.369
Ah, stupid security glass!

26:31.905 --> 26:33.072
Gary?

26:36.077 --> 26:37.611
Gary, what are you doing?

26:37.645 --> 26:38.879
I'm using two chairs.

26:38.913 --> 26:40.080
- Gary, no.
- I tried one chair.

26:40.114 --> 26:41.114
Now I'm using two.
- Gary, Gary--

26:41.148 --> 26:43.216
No, Dr. Rosen,
I used one chair.

26:43.250 --> 26:44.751
- I'm speaking to you, Gary.
- Yeah, let me use the chairs.

26:44.785 --> 26:46.553
I need your help.
Will you come with me?

26:46.587 --> 26:48.788
- I am helping.
- Come with me, please.

26:48.822 --> 26:50.690
It won't kill you,

26:50.724 --> 26:54.427
but no bouncing off the ceilings
for a few days, okay?

26:54.461 --> 26:56.062
Well, I'm glad someone
paid attention

26:56.097 --> 26:58.598
during the first-aid class
Harken made us take.

26:58.632 --> 27:00.400
Okay, come on, come on.
We got to find Rachel.

27:00.434 --> 27:02.602
I'll get Rosen to give you
some pain pills.

27:02.636 --> 27:04.003
Addict.

27:04.037 --> 27:06.238
Sorry.

27:15.549 --> 27:17.116
Not good for you.

27:17.150 --> 27:19.118
Don't care.

27:19.152 --> 27:20.853
That witch took my phone.

27:20.887 --> 27:22.588
- What witch?
- The witch!

27:22.622 --> 27:24.623
That's the word my mom uses
when she's angry.

27:24.658 --> 27:25.858
She uses another word, too.

27:25.892 --> 27:28.460
She took Rachel,
and she took my phone.

27:28.495 --> 27:29.762
The bitch got my gun.

27:29.796 --> 27:32.598
[Gunshots]

27:32.632 --> 27:35.334
- I think it's from--
- That sounded like my gun.

27:39.806 --> 27:42.174
- Bulletproof glass...
- Gary.

27:42.208 --> 27:43.475
Excellent idea.

27:43.510 --> 27:44.643
- It's crackly.
- Gary.

27:44.678 --> 27:46.678
Do you have my phone?
Do you have Rachel?

27:46.713 --> 27:48.247
Gary, Gary,
I need you to see

27:48.281 --> 27:49.982
if you can get the computer
systems back online.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.150
- Don't leave his side.
- Got it.

27:51.184 --> 27:52.779
- Cameron.
- Rachel--I'm on it.

27:52.780 --> 27:54.680
- This just in my gut.
- Hey, hey, where is she?

27:54.756 --> 27:56.323
Where's blind spot girl?

27:56.357 --> 27:58.325
You mean the person
who just tried to shoot me?

27:58.360 --> 28:00.494
Or free you.

28:00.529 --> 28:02.696
I say "day,"
you say "night."

28:02.731 --> 28:05.632
We're never going to find
common ground like this.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.868
Yeah, you want common ground,
why don't you start with a name?

28:07.902 --> 28:09.402
Griffin.

28:09.437 --> 28:10.770
Her name is Griffin,

28:10.804 --> 28:12.905
but I suspect
it's a nom de guerre.

28:12.940 --> 28:17.343
Red Flag considers her
an unsanctioned variable.

28:17.377 --> 28:19.545
What exactly does that mean?

28:19.579 --> 28:23.516
Someone who sells their
services to the highest bidder

28:23.550 --> 28:27.353
but supports no cause,
has no allegiance.

28:27.387 --> 28:29.721
A person should believe
in something, don't you think?

28:31.724 --> 28:33.592
You two I respect.

28:33.626 --> 28:34.960
Even though you're wrong,

28:34.994 --> 28:37.596
at least you're loyal to
a cause greater than yourselves.

28:37.630 --> 28:39.064
So you're saying
that she's just a mercenary

28:39.098 --> 28:40.399
doing anything for money?

28:40.433 --> 28:44.203
My ability can be
extremely useful in finding her,

28:44.238 --> 28:48.107
not to mention your
missing compatriot, Rachel.

28:48.142 --> 28:49.543
- Rachel, yes.
- I don't think so.

28:49.577 --> 28:51.946
Then you guys waltz out of here
laughing your asses off.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.047
Good try.

28:53.081 --> 28:54.715
Does it look like
I'm laughing?

28:54.750 --> 28:55.917
Griffin's after me.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.685
She'll do whatever it takes
to get me,

28:57.719 --> 28:59.220
including killing all of you.

28:59.254 --> 29:01.956
Look, either you're a target,
or you're an accomplice,

29:01.990 --> 29:03.625
but either way, you're staying
right where you are

29:03.659 --> 29:07.562
until we hand you over to Cley.

29:07.596 --> 29:08.563
[Door closes]

29:08.597 --> 29:09.897
Rachel.

29:09.931 --> 29:12.966
The blast door--
I can't get it open.

29:15.336 --> 29:17.704
Why do we always have to fight
other people with abilities?

29:17.739 --> 29:20.207
It's annoying.

29:27.281 --> 29:29.615
[Muffled screaming]

29:36.289 --> 29:38.090
I guess I'm not meant
to be normal, huh?

29:38.124 --> 29:39.457
I'm sorry, Bill.

29:39.492 --> 29:42.193
I hoped we'd have
more time to talk, but--

29:42.228 --> 29:43.461
you know,
weigh the pros and cons

29:43.496 --> 29:45.063
and let you have more time

29:45.098 --> 29:47.599
to make your own decision
about this.

29:47.634 --> 29:49.267
You know, when you used
to talk to me like this,

29:49.302 --> 29:50.435
it used to make me cranky.

29:50.470 --> 29:52.271
Well, I'm afraid
it will again.

29:52.305 --> 29:53.672
[Groans]

29:53.706 --> 29:56.908
So the decision
has been made for me.

29:56.943 --> 29:58.243
How long's it take?

29:58.278 --> 30:00.312
Should take effect
immediately.

30:00.346 --> 30:03.348
All right, let's give
this sucker a test-drive.

30:16.196 --> 30:17.863
Come on, Bill.

30:17.897 --> 30:19.965
I can do this.
I can do this.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.734
You should be able to by now.

30:21.768 --> 30:23.602
The drugs should be
kicking in.

30:23.636 --> 30:25.336
[Groaning]

30:25.371 --> 30:27.171
Doc, it's not happening.
It's not happening.

30:27.206 --> 30:28.806
Look, I'm not sweating, right?

30:28.840 --> 30:30.341
My heart rate feels normal.

30:30.375 --> 30:31.876
I'm not feeling
any rush or--

30:31.910 --> 30:33.377
- Do you want to?
- Of course I want to.

30:33.411 --> 30:35.111
No, that's not
what I'm asking you.

30:35.146 --> 30:37.080
What are you saying?

30:37.114 --> 30:38.481
You think it's in my head?

30:38.515 --> 30:41.050
Well, your ability to do this
has always been linked

30:41.085 --> 30:42.785
to an emotional state
of yours.

30:42.820 --> 30:44.387
You can't have one
without the other.

30:44.421 --> 30:46.122
We are not gonna die because
I can't get this up.

30:46.157 --> 30:47.490
Well, that should
make you angry.

30:47.525 --> 30:50.727
[Groaning]

30:50.762 --> 30:52.529
All right, all right, stop.
Stop, stop.

30:52.563 --> 30:54.030
Stop. Stop.

30:54.065 --> 30:56.866
You can't do this,
all right?

30:56.900 --> 30:58.435
It's okay.
Now, we can't find Rachel.

30:58.469 --> 31:00.571
And I think we're going
about this the wrong way.

31:00.605 --> 31:03.407
I think we need to go
on the offensive.

31:03.442 --> 31:04.942
Are you sure
this is going to work?

31:04.976 --> 31:06.610
That's it,
break up the patterns.

31:06.645 --> 31:08.012
The more abstract
the background,

31:08.046 --> 31:09.580
the harder it should be
for Griffin to blend in.

31:09.614 --> 31:10.781
It's messy.

31:10.815 --> 31:12.516
I know Gary, but we're gonna
clean it up, Gary, I promise.

31:12.551 --> 31:14.585
Gary, move.

31:14.620 --> 31:16.387
Gary, Gary, move, move.

31:16.422 --> 31:17.656
I am. I am.

31:17.690 --> 31:19.892
Gary, stay right here by--
sit down by that pillar.

31:29.870 --> 31:32.738
Okay, camera's on.
Ten cameras.

31:34.868 --> 31:36.068
Nina, be careful.

31:36.243 --> 31:37.276
You bleeding again?

31:37.311 --> 31:39.045
No, it's fine.

31:39.079 --> 31:41.981
We'll get Rosen
to look at it, okay?

31:42.136 --> 31:43.336
Over here.

31:44.499 --> 31:45.699
Look behind you.

31:45.753 --> 31:47.187
She's running.

31:47.221 --> 31:48.955
- There!
- Where?

31:48.989 --> 31:50.456
Footprints in the creamer.

31:51.268 --> 31:53.383
Gary get in your office.
Lock the door.

31:54.427 --> 31:57.295
She's in the MRI room.

31:57.329 --> 31:58.562
[Overlapping shouting]

31:58.597 --> 32:00.565
Nina, get back here.

32:00.599 --> 32:02.366
Where is she?

32:02.401 --> 32:04.869
Where'd she go?

32:04.903 --> 32:06.771
It's a trap!

32:06.805 --> 32:08.239
Bill, that door.

32:08.274 --> 32:10.575
Get out.

32:10.610 --> 32:12.611
Oh my God, Gary.
Gary?

32:12.645 --> 32:14.980
Damn it, she's got us.

32:15.014 --> 32:16.148
Gary! Gary!

32:16.182 --> 32:17.750
Open up, Gary!

32:17.784 --> 32:19.385
Gary, get to your office
and lock the door.

32:19.419 --> 32:20.720
- Gary!
- Okay.

32:20.754 --> 32:23.222
Son of a bitch.

32:23.257 --> 32:24.257
Gary!

32:24.291 --> 32:25.959
D.C.I.S.
don't move!

32:25.993 --> 32:27.928
Stop hiding.
Come out.

32:27.962 --> 32:29.103
Open up!

32:29.104 --> 32:31.172
Stop hiding.

32:34.701 --> 32:36.779
Okay, you're only
making it worse for yourself.

32:37.344 --> 32:39.388
Just please--
you have to stop hiding.

32:39.389 --> 32:41.023
D.C.I.S.
you're under arrest.

32:41.057 --> 32:42.124
Stop hiding!

32:42.158 --> 32:44.326
D.C.I.S.
you're under arrest now.

32:44.361 --> 32:45.727
- Go to your office!
- Please, stop.

32:45.762 --> 32:47.729
You have to stop, please.
Stop, please, don't!

32:47.764 --> 32:50.065
- Hey!
- No, no.

32:50.099 --> 32:53.802
[Screaming]

32:55.571 --> 32:57.005
Oh, that felt so good.

32:57.039 --> 32:59.407
Gary, are you okay?

32:59.442 --> 33:03.011
So how do you do this--

33:03.046 --> 33:05.580
fool our brains
so we can't see you?

33:07.851 --> 33:10.886
I've never given it
much thought.

33:10.921 --> 33:12.087
Why don't you cut me loose,

33:12.122 --> 33:14.157
and we can figure it out
together?

33:14.191 --> 33:16.693
I could even give you
a demonstration if you'd like.

33:18.829 --> 33:21.030
Didn't think so.

33:21.065 --> 33:24.468
Kern referred to you
as an unsanctioned variable.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.470
Hmm.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.339
I prefer Ronin.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.541
Sounds cooler.

33:30.575 --> 33:32.176
I mean, I've been following him
for two weeks,

33:32.211 --> 33:34.946
and then you lot scooped him up,
so thanks for that.

33:34.980 --> 33:38.149
Why don't you just let me
take Kern and leave?

33:38.184 --> 33:40.151
It's the easiest solution
to your problem.

33:40.186 --> 33:41.319
Well, that's interesting.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.321
He says we should release him
to stop you,

33:43.355 --> 33:44.823
that you're our problem.

33:44.857 --> 33:48.460
And you don't know
who to believe, huh?

33:48.495 --> 33:50.662
You seen your walls lately?

33:50.696 --> 33:52.731
What are you talking about,
the cracks?

33:52.765 --> 33:56.235
Yeah, we noticed some cracks
on the beams.

34:02.442 --> 34:04.209
There are cracks everywhere.

34:04.244 --> 34:07.046
You got a sonic Alpha
in your holding cell.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.248
He's trying
to break out of here.

34:09.283 --> 34:12.018
And he's been trying
since the minute he woke up.

34:12.053 --> 34:15.088
These vibrations, well...

34:15.123 --> 34:17.024
They take time to build.

34:17.058 --> 34:18.525
Yeah, I don't trust her.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.527
For all we know,
she's working with Kern.

34:20.562 --> 34:23.196
I'm sorry about the knife,
handsome.

34:23.231 --> 34:26.766
See, I don't like it
when people get close to me.

34:26.801 --> 34:29.103
I don't like it
when they can see me either.

34:29.137 --> 34:31.172
That's why Kern's so annoying--

34:31.206 --> 34:33.239
the sonar.

34:33.275 --> 34:34.908
Who are you working for?

34:34.943 --> 34:37.578
Let's just say it's someone
that's interested

34:37.612 --> 34:38.913
in Kern's research.

34:38.947 --> 34:40.781
His so-called vitamins?

34:40.815 --> 34:44.717
Look, I get paid
for delivering Kern's research,

34:44.752 --> 34:47.087
which I've already gotten
off your computers.

34:47.121 --> 34:49.257
I get a bonus
for bringing in Kern.

34:49.291 --> 34:51.092
I can't do that if I'm dead.

34:51.126 --> 34:53.694
Let's just call a truce.

34:53.728 --> 34:55.462
You let me take him
out of here.

34:55.496 --> 34:57.098
I get my fee.

34:57.132 --> 34:59.033
You get to live.

34:59.067 --> 35:00.468
We all win.

35:03.405 --> 35:06.206
Hicks.

35:06.241 --> 35:09.042
Dr. Rosen,
he's bleeding again.

35:09.077 --> 35:11.044
Come with me.

35:13.180 --> 35:14.848
Still bleeding.

35:14.882 --> 35:16.616
What's going on?

35:16.651 --> 35:18.451
It's probably the vibrations.

35:23.124 --> 35:25.258
It's okay. It's not like
I'm dying or anything.

35:27.127 --> 35:30.663
You don't want Doc here thinking
you actually care about me.

35:30.698 --> 35:32.465
Very funny.

35:33.900 --> 35:35.334
Scissors.

35:35.368 --> 35:37.036
Doc, Doc, take a look.

35:37.070 --> 35:38.971
- Look.
- Give me this.

35:39.006 --> 35:41.441
Right there.

35:41.475 --> 35:42.776
Oh, my goodness.

35:42.810 --> 35:44.344
I can hear the rumbles.

35:44.379 --> 35:46.813
It's getting worse.

35:46.848 --> 35:48.182
Doc.

35:48.216 --> 35:50.084
Doc, I think you need
to take a look at him.

35:50.118 --> 35:53.054
I wasn't hurting anyone.
Don't make me hurt you.

35:53.088 --> 35:55.189
Whatever happens to us
is gonna happen to you.

35:55.223 --> 35:57.091
If you bring
this whole building down--

35:57.125 --> 36:00.161
All I wanted was to bring
more Alphas into the world.

36:00.195 --> 36:02.029
Why is that wrong?

36:02.063 --> 36:04.765
Why are you treating me
like a criminal?

36:04.800 --> 36:07.093
Bill, Bill, we've got to get
inside there and stop him.

36:07.094 --> 36:09.016
- Here, take this.
- What is this?

36:09.071 --> 36:10.204
Ether.

36:10.239 --> 36:12.207
It's not elegant,
but it's quick.

36:12.241 --> 36:15.543
[Rachel gasps]

36:15.577 --> 36:17.444
Aah!

36:17.479 --> 36:18.779
It's hot as hell.

36:18.813 --> 36:20.680
He's turned the cell
into a reverb chamber.

36:20.715 --> 36:22.182
It's shaking
the whole building,

36:22.216 --> 36:23.516
and it's creating heat.

36:23.551 --> 36:26.887
The metal might be
at the breaking point.

36:39.734 --> 36:42.169
Dr. Rosen!

37:45.230 --> 37:47.566
Duck and cover.
Bill, duck and cover.

37:47.567 --> 37:49.068
Gary?
Gary, watch her.

37:49.102 --> 37:50.203
Yeah, okay,
I'll do both.

37:50.237 --> 37:53.006
I'll watch, and I'll cover.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.340
I'll cover us.

38:00.747 --> 38:02.782
He's lost too much blood.
We got to get him out of here.

38:02.816 --> 38:05.251
Hicks, come on, come on.

38:05.285 --> 38:06.752
- Take him to the blast door.
- Yeah.

38:06.787 --> 38:09.188
I'll find Rosen.

38:09.222 --> 38:11.223
[Loud vibrations]

38:11.257 --> 38:13.693
Who hired you?

38:13.727 --> 38:16.262
I was told
to bring you in alive,

38:16.297 --> 38:17.730
but that's never
gonna happen.

38:17.765 --> 38:19.699
Who hired you?

38:19.733 --> 38:21.567
[Loud vibrations]

38:52.266 --> 38:53.734
No!

38:59.341 --> 39:00.842
It's too late!

39:02.945 --> 39:04.112
[Groans]

39:10.187 --> 39:12.255
So much for my bonus.

39:16.061 --> 39:18.662
You know,
a man with your abilities

39:18.696 --> 39:20.564
could make a lot of money

39:20.598 --> 39:23.500
if he went into business
for himself.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.135
That's never gonna happen.

39:25.170 --> 39:26.503
Yeah?

39:26.538 --> 39:28.138
Well, I owe you one.

39:28.173 --> 39:30.608
And I hate owing people.

39:30.642 --> 39:33.477
So I'll pay you back.

39:33.512 --> 39:35.213
Stanton Parish.

39:35.247 --> 39:38.082
What the hell is that?

39:38.116 --> 39:40.684
You better find out.

39:45.056 --> 39:48.058
Who knew office work
was so dangerous, huh?

39:48.092 --> 39:50.527
Stanton Parish?

39:50.561 --> 39:52.563
Yeah, yeah.

39:52.597 --> 39:54.998
It was something
that, uh, Griffin threw at me

39:55.033 --> 39:56.466
as a parting gift, I guess.

39:56.501 --> 39:58.935
I don't know.
Maybe it's a place, a person.

39:58.970 --> 40:01.371
- I don't know.
- Well, we'll look into it.

40:01.406 --> 40:03.474
Yeah, well,
the sooner the better, Doc.

40:03.508 --> 40:05.743
I told you that we needed
gun turrets, Bill.

40:05.777 --> 40:07.244
You know what?
I talked to your mother

40:07.279 --> 40:09.814
and asked her, could we
fight Alphas in your bedroom?

40:09.848 --> 40:11.682
And she said no.
What's up with that?

40:11.716 --> 40:13.116
That's not helpful, bill.

40:13.151 --> 40:14.918
My house would be
the worst place to fight.

40:14.952 --> 40:16.520
And anyway,
my bedroom's off-limits.

40:16.554 --> 40:17.955
Gary, no,
that's a great place.

40:17.989 --> 40:20.224
I think, you know, we can keep
them as prisoners there or--

40:20.259 --> 40:21.859
Yeah, yeah, I know what
you're trying to do, Bill.

40:21.894 --> 40:24.329
You're trying to annoy me,
but it's not gonna work.

40:24.363 --> 40:25.664
You know, you were
a lot less annoying

40:25.698 --> 40:27.065
when you didn't have
your abilities.

40:27.099 --> 40:28.633
And now that you've got
your ability back,

40:28.668 --> 40:30.101
you're annoying again.

40:30.136 --> 40:32.103
You're Bill again.
You're the old Bill.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.439
You're damn right I am.

40:38.644 --> 40:41.612
Nina, you don't have
to clean up my office.

40:41.647 --> 40:44.015
Yeah, well, don't want
your wound to open up.

40:44.049 --> 40:45.349
Rachel would smell blood--

40:45.384 --> 40:47.252
I get it, you like me.

40:47.286 --> 40:48.553
[Chuckles]

40:48.587 --> 40:50.254
Don't be so, uh...

40:50.289 --> 40:51.722
Don't be so juvenile.

40:51.757 --> 40:54.525
Come on, I saw how you
reacted when I got cut.

40:54.559 --> 40:56.961
I would've done
the same thing to anyone.

40:56.995 --> 40:58.262
Hmm.

40:58.296 --> 40:59.864
Well, how about this?

41:07.472 --> 41:09.873
Now, that's
pretty grown-up, huh?

41:16.448 --> 41:19.783
Wow.

41:19.817 --> 41:21.651
I don't care what Cley says.

41:21.686 --> 41:24.053
This was a bad idea.

41:24.088 --> 41:26.890
Yes, we do seem to be learning
by trial and error.

41:26.924 --> 41:28.658
Hmm.

41:28.693 --> 41:30.827
Mostly error.

41:30.861 --> 41:33.063
So no more prisoners
in the office, right?

41:33.097 --> 41:36.967
Oh, I certainly hope not,
Rachel.

41:37.001 --> 41:40.404
You know,
you, uh, saved all of us--

41:40.438 --> 41:45.342
dropping Griffin
and detecting Kern's ability.

41:45.376 --> 41:48.111
Just trying
to earn my paycheck.

41:48.146 --> 41:49.980
I scanned the entire office.

41:50.014 --> 41:52.849
There's no sign of Griffin.
She got away.

41:52.883 --> 41:54.184
And I'm assuming that she took

41:54.218 --> 41:55.919
the data on Kern's vitamins
with her.

41:55.953 --> 41:58.288
She probably delivered it
to her new employers,

41:58.322 --> 41:59.755
whoever they are.

41:59.790 --> 42:01.056
Hmm.

42:01.091 --> 42:02.925
Hmm.

42:02.959 --> 42:04.959
Things aren't gonna get
easier, are they?
