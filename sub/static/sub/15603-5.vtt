WEBVTT

00:02.689 --> 00:04.588
Henry has moles
inside Langley,

00:04.589 --> 00:08.009
and Annie just discovered that
Seth Newman was one of them.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.260
He attacked Annie.

00:09.345 --> 00:12.213
- Where's the body?
- Somewhere in the Potomac.

00:12.264 --> 00:14.316
I have a son.
His name is Teo.

00:14.383 --> 00:15.767
My name
is Calder Michaels,

00:15.851 --> 00:18.069
and I'm the station chief
here in Medellin.

00:18.154 --> 00:19.654
Calder!

00:19.722 --> 00:20.989
Don't!

00:21.056 --> 00:23.274
Every time this phone rings
I want you to answer it.

00:23.359 --> 00:24.492
It's untraceable.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.695
Anderson,
you went against my advice,

00:26.746 --> 00:28.530
and you continued
with an operation

00:28.581 --> 00:30.915
that led to the violent deaths
of two Chinese citizens

00:31.000 --> 00:32.033
under your protection.

00:32.084 --> 00:33.585
You have been relieved
of your duties

00:33.669 --> 00:35.203
as interim head
of the DPD.

00:35.254 --> 00:38.573
- Who's my replacement?
- It's Calder.

00:43.411 --> 00:46.380
I'm sorry, Auggie.
Annie!

01:05.651 --> 01:09.370
It's me.
Operative Walker is dead.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.439
I repeat,
Annie Walker is dead.

01:26.555 --> 01:29.840
Hey.
You went out?

01:29.925 --> 01:32.310
Hey, sorry, I didn't want
to wake you when I got up.

01:32.394 --> 01:34.512
It's okay, I'm up.
What's going on?

01:34.596 --> 01:37.481
I just had drinks
with Amy Jacobs.

01:37.566 --> 01:38.966
I don't know
who Amy Jacobs is.

01:39.017 --> 01:40.801
She's an LD
on the intelligence committee

01:40.852 --> 01:43.404
for Senator Pierson,
used to work in the DPD.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.690
- Hmm.
- I just can't let go

01:45.774 --> 01:47.358
of this Calder stuff.
I wanted to get

01:47.442 --> 01:49.527
a little more background
on the DCI's decision.

01:49.611 --> 01:51.245
- Did you find anything out?
- Well,

01:51.313 --> 01:53.581
Amy just told me
that Senator Pierson

01:53.648 --> 01:56.483
has a very tight relationship
with Henry Wilcox.

01:56.535 --> 02:00.087
Henry and Pierson had a long
conversation two days ago,

02:00.155 --> 02:02.456
just before she put in
a call to the DCI.

02:02.507 --> 02:07.261
Topic of conversation:
Calder Michaels.

02:07.329 --> 02:09.997
Henry got Calder
the DPD job?

02:10.048 --> 02:12.683
Looks like
he's Henry's new mole.

02:12.768 --> 02:14.352
Fox is in the hen house.

02:14.436 --> 02:17.605
Think we just overloaded
on animal metaphors.

02:31.903 --> 02:34.405
Looks like Calder
didn't waste any time

02:34.489 --> 02:37.158
putting his stamp
on the place.

02:37.209 --> 02:40.294
Hey, sorry to hear the news,
Auggie.

02:40.362 --> 02:42.496
I'm angry and sad,

02:42.547 --> 02:44.382
and you know what,
I'm slightly annoyed too.

02:44.466 --> 02:47.551
Thanks, Eric.
It's all right, I'm fine.

02:47.636 --> 02:49.887
Let's get started,
everyone.

02:49.972 --> 02:54.141
As you all now know,
my name is Calder Michaels.

02:54.209 --> 02:56.543
Look around.
A lot feels different.

02:56.595 --> 02:58.396
The reason
for these changes?

02:58.480 --> 03:02.099
I am shattering
the old ways of doing things.

03:02.184 --> 03:05.770
Red tape will be replaced
with vertical communication.

03:05.854 --> 03:08.406
The shortest distance between
two points is a direct line.

03:08.490 --> 03:09.940
I am that line.

03:10.025 --> 03:14.561
And these changes will push you
out your comfort zone.

03:14.613 --> 03:18.749
But that's a good thing.
Comfort is not our goal.

03:18.834 --> 03:20.401
Over the next few days,
I'll be meeting with each of you

03:20.452 --> 03:22.903
one-on-one to fully evaluate
your job efficiency,

03:22.954 --> 03:25.339
and some egos
are gonna get bruised.

03:25.407 --> 03:26.841
But that's okay too,

03:26.908 --> 03:32.096
because we are the Domestic
Protection Division.

03:32.180 --> 03:35.082
The work we do
is vital.

03:35.133 --> 03:40.587
So let's be smarter and more
aggressive than our enemies.

03:40.639 --> 03:45.109
Let's do this.
Let's get to work.

03:49.197 --> 03:51.649
Tough few days, huh?

03:51.733 --> 03:54.035
Spent most of last night getting
up to speed on the Chens.

03:54.102 --> 03:56.070
You got outplayed.

03:56.121 --> 03:57.738
Didn't turn up a shred
of actionable intel.

03:57.789 --> 04:00.041
I'm gonna analyze the SIM card
on Wendy Chen's cell

04:00.108 --> 04:01.542
this morning.
I'm sure we'll find something.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.294
I analyzed it already
myself.

04:03.378 --> 04:05.446
One of her contacts
led me to the discovery

04:05.497 --> 04:07.581
of a wire transfer
made about five weeks ago

04:07.632 --> 04:09.333
to an arms dealer
named Dion Stavros.

04:09.418 --> 04:11.298
You just said there wasn't
any actionable intel.

04:11.336 --> 04:15.622
I said <i>you</i> didn't find
any actionable intel.

04:15.674 --> 04:17.558
Greek national,
based out of Madrid

04:17.625 --> 04:19.894
for the last nine years.
Deals in Cruise missiles,

04:19.961 --> 04:21.795
heavy artillery, whatever
he can get his hands on.

04:21.846 --> 04:23.147
We know
who Dion Stavros is.

04:23.231 --> 04:24.511
Did you know
that two months ago,

04:24.516 --> 04:25.799
Spanish intelligence
raided his apartment

04:25.851 --> 04:26.967
in the Salamanca district?

04:27.018 --> 04:28.652
Stavros barely escaped.

04:28.737 --> 04:29.770
Now, he's setting up shop
in Vienna.

04:29.821 --> 04:31.939
Why isn't the CNI
after him?

04:31.990 --> 04:33.774
He's Interpol's problem now,
and we all know

04:33.825 --> 04:34.992
how long
that's gonna take.

04:35.077 --> 04:38.746
- Where do we fit in?
- You, Annie Walker,

04:38.813 --> 04:43.284
are going to Vienna
to fit in with him.

04:43.335 --> 04:44.785
Find out where exactly
he's getting his weapons

04:44.836 --> 04:46.754
and to whom
he's selling them.

04:46.821 --> 04:51.125
And it could take some time
and a new cover.

04:51.176 --> 04:53.210
My new NOC's
as an importer/exporter.

04:53.295 --> 04:55.546
Using your old cover
working for the Smithsonian,

04:55.630 --> 04:56.797
where you were fired.

04:56.848 --> 04:59.016
Now, in Vienna,
you'll pitch yourself to Stavros

04:59.101 --> 05:01.051
as a businesswoman
looking to expand

05:01.136 --> 05:03.637
into international trade
as his new shipping agent.

05:03.688 --> 05:04.889
Why does he need
a new shipper?

05:04.973 --> 05:06.507
He's been running guns
for more than a decade.

05:06.558 --> 05:08.275
His last guy ratted him out
to the Spanish

05:08.343 --> 05:09.860
and Stavros killed him.

05:09.945 --> 05:12.363
When the CNI raided
Stavros's apartment in Madrid,

05:12.447 --> 05:14.014
they confiscated
everything he owned,

05:14.065 --> 05:16.033
including
a massive art collection.

05:16.118 --> 05:18.285
Yesterday,
the media announced

05:18.353 --> 05:20.321
that the entire lot was stolen
from a police lock-up.

05:20.372 --> 05:22.406
But what really happened
was the CNI just

05:22.491 --> 05:25.359
made it look like a robbery
so they could get us his stuff.

05:25.410 --> 05:27.461
Now Annie can go to Stavros
and tell him

05:27.529 --> 05:29.530
she's the one who got
the collection out of Spain.

05:29.581 --> 05:30.864
- Okay.
- Annie and I

05:30.916 --> 05:33.634
can make that work.
Actually, Auggie,

05:33.701 --> 05:37.037
you're not gonna make it work.
I am.

05:37.088 --> 05:40.040
As of this mission,
I'll be Annie's handler.

05:40.091 --> 05:42.376
Calder,
that's not necessary.

05:42.427 --> 05:44.261
You're having
a sexual relationship,

05:44.346 --> 05:46.480
and quite frankly,
there's no worse way

05:46.548 --> 05:50.184
to compromise a mission
or the safety of an operative.

05:50.235 --> 05:52.653
Come on, guys,
a trainee at the Farm

05:52.720 --> 05:54.188
could see it
by watching you.

05:54.239 --> 05:55.889
Think of it
as a compliment.

05:55.941 --> 05:59.243
You like each other. It shows.
It's just not safe.

05:59.327 --> 06:01.395
Calder, why don't you settle
into this job

06:01.446 --> 06:03.948
for a couple days at least
before adding

06:04.032 --> 06:06.917
the responsibility of handling
an operative in the field?

06:07.002 --> 06:09.670
My decision's made.
And one more thing--

06:09.737 --> 06:13.624
during this mission, I need 100%
radio silence between you two.

06:13.708 --> 06:16.243
- I'm sorry?
- We can't communicate?

06:16.294 --> 06:18.012
Why?
It sounds harsh,

06:18.079 --> 06:19.763
but it's in your
best interest.

06:19.848 --> 06:21.515
If you talk,
you're going to talk shop,

06:21.583 --> 06:23.968
and it could lead
to emotional decisions.

06:24.052 --> 06:28.105
Annie, your flight to Vienna
leaves in three hours.

06:28.190 --> 06:31.108
Let's rock and roll.

06:38.433 --> 06:40.100
What do you think
we should do about this?

06:40.151 --> 06:41.819
We'll figure it out.
We're spies.

06:41.903 --> 06:43.770
Calder's a spy too.

06:43.822 --> 06:46.373
He's going to be scrutinizing
our every move.

06:46.441 --> 06:48.292
I think we should go silent
on this one.

06:48.376 --> 06:50.611
You think we should stop
talking to each other?

06:50.662 --> 06:52.580
At least
until Calder trusts us.

06:52.631 --> 06:54.298
It doesn't help us
in the short term.

06:54.382 --> 06:56.500
Calder's almost certainly
working for Henry.

06:56.585 --> 06:58.345
We don't know why
he's sending you to Vienna.

06:58.386 --> 07:00.471
We don't know
that his intel's even real.

07:00.555 --> 07:02.456
He certainly found
the money transfers

07:02.507 --> 07:04.675
between Stavros and the Chens
quickly.

07:04.759 --> 07:09.430
I know it won't be easy, but
I think it's the prudent play.

07:13.801 --> 07:17.021
Annie, this is dangerous.
It could be a trap.

07:19.991 --> 07:22.443
Ever since I came up here
from the Farm, talking to you

07:22.494 --> 07:28.699
was the way I made sense
of this job, of this life.

07:28.783 --> 07:31.201
But I think
we should try this.

07:35.874 --> 07:38.342
We're good.

07:38.426 --> 07:41.345
Yeah, we're good.

07:59.189 --> 08:02.189

for www.addic7ed.com

08:47.913 --> 08:50.331
I wanted to wait
until a decent hour to call you.

08:50.398 --> 08:53.234
If it's about work,
it's always a decent hour.

08:53.285 --> 08:55.870
- How's the hotel?
- Looks great.

08:55.921 --> 08:57.788
Did you get my gift?

08:57.873 --> 08:59.540
- Yes.
- Good, it should all look

08:59.591 --> 09:01.392
like there's no expense spared
for your cover.

09:01.409 --> 09:04.295
And speaking of your cover--
I did nothing but study it

09:04.379 --> 09:06.747
on the nine-hour flight
from D.C.

09:06.798 --> 09:08.716
I'm assuming
this belongs to Stavros.

09:08.767 --> 09:11.435
Yes, it's part
of his confiscated collection.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.387
You'll need it tonight.
What's tonight?

09:13.438 --> 09:15.723
Dion Stavros
is going to the Vienna opera.

09:15.774 --> 09:17.975
It's your perfect chance
to cross with him.

09:18.060 --> 09:20.594
Calder, I just got my NOC
yesterday.

09:20.646 --> 09:22.263
And just said
that you were up to speed.

09:22.314 --> 09:23.948
You said Stavros
doesn't trust easily.

09:24.032 --> 09:26.400
If what we're going for
is the long-term play, we have

09:26.451 --> 09:29.070
nothing but time to make sure
we're absolutely ready for him.

09:29.121 --> 09:30.938
The situation's changed.

09:30.989 --> 09:32.707
I just found out that
a cache of missile launchers

09:32.774 --> 09:35.409
disappeared from Maribor,
Slovenia, one week ago.

09:35.460 --> 09:37.712
Intel suggests
that Stavros has them,

09:37.779 --> 09:39.714
and if he does,
he needs to move them fast,

09:39.781 --> 09:42.300
which means he'll need to hire
someone to ship them quickly.

09:42.384 --> 09:44.886
I'm willing to forgo
the long term play

09:44.953 --> 09:46.787
to make sure the missiles
don't end up in the wrong hands.

09:46.838 --> 09:48.256
We're accelerating
the time line.

09:48.695 --> 09:51.195
You see, I knew you
were a quick learner.

10:09.598 --> 10:11.049
Auggie Anderson.

10:11.487 --> 10:13.554
What's it been,
two, three years?

10:13.605 --> 10:14.989
Tyler,
good to see you.

10:15.056 --> 10:17.408
What the hell brings you
to Fort Belvoir?

10:17.493 --> 10:19.560
Someplace private
we can catch up?

10:20.729 --> 10:21.896
Dion Stavros
was dealing weapons

10:21.947 --> 10:23.781
out of Madrid
for the past nine years,

10:23.866 --> 10:25.116
at least until recently.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.041
Yeah, that stuff I know.
I was hoping you might

10:27.085 --> 10:29.587
have something in your files
I couldn't get in the CIA.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.372
Maybe you guys did
your own investigation?

10:31.423 --> 10:33.073
No, everything we got,
we got from you.

10:33.125 --> 10:36.677
He was a CIA asset
up until '09.

10:36.745 --> 10:38.679
There's nothing
in our database

10:38.747 --> 10:40.631
about Stavros
being a CIA asset.

10:40.716 --> 10:42.750
Among other things,
says Stavros was

10:42.801 --> 10:46.587
feeding Langley intel
on the 2007 rebellion in Niger.

10:46.638 --> 10:48.439
Hey, do me a favor, would you
put whatever you've got

10:48.524 --> 10:50.475
on this flash drive?

10:50.559 --> 10:52.059
As long as you
brought whiskey.

10:52.110 --> 10:55.062
Who do you think
you're talking to?

10:57.399 --> 11:00.952
My man.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.831
You're glowing
even more than this morning.

11:13.916 --> 11:16.968
Pregnancy suits you.

11:17.052 --> 11:19.420
Let's not get
carried away.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.756
- This isn't for show, Joan.
- I know,

11:21.807 --> 11:24.058
and I'm very glad
you're home.

11:24.125 --> 11:26.177
But we have some serious matters
to discuss.

11:26.261 --> 11:29.013
Auggie found out
it was Senator Pierson

11:29.097 --> 11:32.767
who had the DCI's ear
on Calder Michaels.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.068
- Pierson?
- Mm-hmm.

11:34.135 --> 11:35.736
How the hell did she
even know of Calder?

11:35.737 --> 11:38.356
Henry recommended him
to her.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.108
- Damn it.
- Calder's already making waves.

11:41.159 --> 11:44.311
He removed Auggie as Annie's
handler and installed himself.

11:44.363 --> 11:45.780
Henry said it would be
a tough day at Langley

11:45.831 --> 11:49.500
the same day this all happened.
He's calling his own shots.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.324
You have to do something
about Calder.

11:57.376 --> 12:00.678
Calder is well on my radar,
believe me,

12:00.762 --> 12:02.380
especially now with what
he's doing with Annie,

12:02.464 --> 12:04.465
but he's head
of the DPD now.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.000
I've got to paint
inside the lines.

12:06.051 --> 12:08.002
Oh, you can't just
play defense.

12:08.053 --> 12:11.171
We need to find a way
to learn what Henry's doing

12:11.223 --> 12:13.173
before he does it.

12:15.644 --> 12:18.980
I'm on it.

12:48.209 --> 12:49.710
Hey, what's up?

12:49.761 --> 12:51.228
I thought we said we weren't
gonna call each other.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.264
This is worth
calling about.

12:53.348 --> 12:55.850
Stavros used to work
for Henry.

12:55.901 --> 12:59.770
He was a CIA asset until the day
Henry was run out of Langley,

12:59.855 --> 13:02.073
then every mention of it
was wiped from the database.

13:02.157 --> 13:04.224
I'm making a pass
at Stavros tonight.

13:04.276 --> 13:06.277
- No, Annie, that's too fast.
- I know,

13:06.361 --> 13:10.397
but there are factors...
I can't tell you about.

13:10.449 --> 13:12.783
No factor
can be that compelling.

13:12.868 --> 13:14.452
You gotta tell Calder
you're not ready.

13:14.536 --> 13:16.037
Stavros has
an itchy trigger finger,

13:16.088 --> 13:18.756
and he probably knows
you're coming.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.426
You're not my handler,
Auggie.

13:22.511 --> 13:26.847
You think
you can do this?

13:26.915 --> 13:29.850
I can do this.

13:48.670 --> 13:50.704
Where you been?

13:50.756 --> 13:54.091
I went out for a walk
to clear my head.

13:57.062 --> 14:00.648
You know, I know the changes
around here have probably been

14:00.715 --> 14:03.234
harder on you than anybody else
in the department.

14:03.318 --> 14:05.486
I've had better weeks.

14:05.553 --> 14:09.156
Maybe I can make things
easier.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.058
I read in your file
about an application

14:11.109 --> 14:15.079
for a long-range biometric
identification software project.

14:15.163 --> 14:16.413
Code name: Hummingbird.

14:16.498 --> 14:19.033
Sounded like a way
to track anybody anywhere.

14:19.084 --> 14:22.036
What can you tell me
more about it?

14:23.905 --> 14:26.740
It didn't get approved.
DST is working

14:26.792 --> 14:29.794
on something similar,
although less sophisticated.

14:29.878 --> 14:31.762
They didn't want Hummingbird
to steal their thunder.

14:31.847 --> 14:33.714
Yeah, that classic
bureaucratic bullshit.

14:33.765 --> 14:36.717
Welcome to my world.

14:40.222 --> 14:41.722
I'm approving
Project Hummingbird.

14:41.773 --> 14:43.257
- You're approving it?
- Yeah.

14:43.308 --> 14:45.259
The money can come out of
the DPD discretionary fund.

14:45.310 --> 14:46.894
Get started
on it right away.

14:46.945 --> 14:49.596
You sure you aren't just
looking for busy work for me?

14:49.648 --> 14:51.482
Why, what'll you be doing
if you're not working on it?

14:51.566 --> 14:54.368
Taking more walks
to clear your head?

14:54.435 --> 14:56.153
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means

14:56.238 --> 14:57.799
that if I find out
you're leaving campus

14:57.873 --> 14:59.234
to call Annie
on your private cell,

14:59.241 --> 15:02.159
me and you are gonna have
some real problems.

15:08.216 --> 15:10.134
You and I are gonna have
some real problems.

16:48.083 --> 16:49.500
Hello.

16:49.584 --> 16:51.835
I know you.
Caroline Stainach, right?

16:51.920 --> 16:54.621
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, I'm Annie Walker.

16:54.672 --> 16:57.458
I went to the Sorbonne
with your sister, Vanessa.

16:57.509 --> 17:00.511
Oh, of course.
Annie.

17:00.595 --> 17:02.546
She married that wonderful
boyfriend of hers, didn't she?

17:02.630 --> 17:03.997
- Peter, right?
- Mm, yes.

17:04.049 --> 17:06.133
- They have three kids now.
- Three kids.

17:06.184 --> 17:07.384
- Mm-hmm.
- Will you give her my love?

17:07.469 --> 17:08.835
I will.

17:08.887 --> 17:12.723
Oh, excuse me, how rude of me.
Dion Stavros, Annie--

17:12.807 --> 17:14.608
- Walker.
- Pleasure.

17:14.675 --> 17:15.809
Are you enjoying
<i>La Traviata?</i>

17:15.859 --> 17:17.944
Yeah,
Alfredo's quite good.

17:18.012 --> 17:20.146
Better than the tenor in Madrid.
He sang like a goat.

17:20.198 --> 17:22.616
I agree,
Alfredo's excellent.

17:22.683 --> 17:24.233
Maybe better
than Vittorio Grigolo.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.537
- Mm-hmm.
- Grigolo is quite good,

17:26.621 --> 17:28.381
though he doesn't hold
a candle up to Vargas.

17:28.455 --> 17:32.910
I saw Vargas once.
<i>Manon,</i> in Barcelona.

17:32.994 --> 17:36.080
You two are losing me.

17:36.164 --> 17:38.382
Please excuse me, Annie.
I need champagne.

17:43.471 --> 17:47.091
You two make a nice couple.
Have you been dating long?

17:47.175 --> 17:50.094
Oh, we're not together.
She's just a friend.

17:50.178 --> 17:51.878
To be honest, I'm not sure
why I brought her.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.597
She likes dressing up more than
she does the performance.

17:55.233 --> 18:01.271
I'd, uh, much rather bring
someone who appreciates it more.

18:01.356 --> 18:03.223
You're not from 'round here.
How long are you in town?

18:03.274 --> 18:04.691
Uh, that depends.

18:04.742 --> 18:07.060
I wasn't planning on staying
more than a day or two.

18:07.112 --> 18:08.946
I had business in Madrid,

18:09.030 --> 18:10.790
and always wanted to see
the opera in Vienna,

18:10.865 --> 18:13.700
so I thought,
"why wait any longer?"

18:13.751 --> 18:15.402
So what does your stay
depend upon?

18:15.453 --> 18:17.571
If I get any business
in Vienna,

18:17.622 --> 18:19.423
I'll write the whole thing off
as a tax deduction.

18:21.176 --> 18:23.760
Well, I also like
mixing business with pleasure.

18:29.434 --> 18:32.386
Let me take you
to <i>La Bohem</i> next week.

18:32.437 --> 18:37.391
I told you.
It all depends on my business.

19:18.285 --> 19:20.195
How did you enjoy the Opera?

19:20.220 --> 19:22.020
Very much

19:22.224 --> 19:24.586
Where's Caroline? I was hoping
we could exchange numbers.

19:24.676 --> 19:26.878
She went home. After three
glasses of champagne,

19:26.962 --> 19:28.546
she slept through
most of the third act.

19:28.631 --> 19:31.649
Oh, what a shame.
I hope she's all right.

19:31.634 --> 19:34.219
You work for Interpol
or CNI, yes?

19:34.303 --> 19:36.037
No.

19:36.088 --> 19:39.007
- I don't believe you.
- Wait, I recently lost

19:39.058 --> 19:42.210
two Chinese friends
to a large government agency,

19:42.261 --> 19:44.596
Wendy and Xu Chen.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.514
I guess you could say
I haven't had a lot of luck

19:46.565 --> 19:50.568
with large government
institutions recently.

19:50.653 --> 19:54.773
So... Import/exports...
In Madrid?

19:54.857 --> 19:56.358
And elsewhere.

19:56.409 --> 20:00.412
I've recently purchased
an apartment here in Vienna

20:00.496 --> 20:02.414
and haven't had a chance
to decorate.

20:02.498 --> 20:05.066
I recently acquired
a large apartment

20:05.117 --> 20:08.086
full of furniture, sculptures,
and antiques.

20:08.170 --> 20:10.789
Some Flemish
modernist painters,

20:10.873 --> 20:15.043
George Grosz, Wols,
and a Paul Klee.

20:17.596 --> 20:21.383
I might be interested
in acquiring the lot.

20:21.434 --> 20:23.518
If you have everything
you say you have,

20:23.585 --> 20:25.303
I'll pay 300,000.

20:25.388 --> 20:28.306
Give Caroline my regards.

20:29.892 --> 20:32.026
Where are you going?

20:33.762 --> 20:38.233
I could make much more selling
each lot off individually.

20:38.284 --> 20:41.569
Wait.

20:41.620 --> 20:44.605
How much do you want?

20:44.657 --> 20:47.075
If you can come up
with 1/2 million,

20:47.126 --> 20:50.795
meet me tomorrow at noon
under the Francis bridge.

21:09.732 --> 21:11.566
Hello?
How was the opera?

21:11.633 --> 21:13.601
Have the truck waiting
on the Danube as scheduled.

21:13.652 --> 21:15.270
No holes in the cover?

21:15.321 --> 21:17.439
Drilling down on Stavros's
blue-blood date worked,

21:17.490 --> 21:18.523
and the jeweled egg bit?

21:18.607 --> 21:20.492
I have my wily ways.

21:20.576 --> 21:23.144
Nice.

21:23.195 --> 21:25.146
One more thing though.
What's that?

21:25.197 --> 21:27.115
I pulled the call logs
on your cell.

21:27.166 --> 21:29.868
You tell your boyfriend
one more thing about our mission

21:29.952 --> 21:31.503
and he'll be transferred
out of the DPD

21:31.587 --> 21:34.005
faster than you can say
"Luciano Pavarotti."

22:06.822 --> 22:10.658
Hello, Annie.

22:10.709 --> 22:13.027
So where's the stuff?

22:13.078 --> 22:15.696
Nearby.
You have something for me?

22:23.923 --> 22:26.591
You can trust me.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.224
I have another proposition
for you.

23:16.275 --> 23:18.142
I think we should
work together.

23:18.227 --> 23:21.729
I know you need someone who can
move things without detection.

23:21.780 --> 23:23.231
You're that person?

23:23.282 --> 23:25.149
The proof's
right in front of you.

23:25.234 --> 23:28.436
I know which border crossings
are understaffed,

23:28.487 --> 23:30.405
which airports
aren't on the map,

23:30.456 --> 23:32.940
and which rivers don't have
enough inspectors.

23:32.992 --> 23:36.995
Well, I have
a proposition for you.

23:41.617 --> 23:46.588
How about I take my money,
I take my possessions,

23:46.639 --> 23:48.789
and I drop you
in the Danube?

23:48.841 --> 23:52.677
That's--that's not
as good a deal for me.

23:52.761 --> 23:56.064
I'll give you credit.
You pulled a magic trick

23:56.131 --> 23:58.349
getting my stuff
back from the Spaniards.

23:58.434 --> 24:02.270
You see, it backfired.
I did my research.

24:02.321 --> 24:05.273
You may have worked
for the Smithsonian Institute,

24:05.324 --> 24:08.359
but no one in my line of work
has heard of you.

24:08.444 --> 24:11.696
You're out of your league.

24:11.780 --> 24:13.581
You're right, Dion,
I've never worked

24:13.649 --> 24:14.815
on this side
of the business,

24:14.867 --> 24:16.150
but that's a good thing.

24:16.201 --> 24:19.120
I don't have allegiances
to anyone else.

24:19.171 --> 24:22.657
And there's
one more reason.

24:22.708 --> 24:26.844
Your Klee isn't
in any of those crates.

24:26.929 --> 24:31.799
That painting alone
is worth over 1/2 million.

24:31.850 --> 24:35.637
You kill me,
you'll never see it again.

24:39.642 --> 24:42.143
Maybe you're a better
businessperson than I thought.

24:46.699 --> 24:51.069
Okay.
I'll give you a job.

24:51.153 --> 24:53.988
A deal of mine
has just fallen through,

24:54.039 --> 24:58.192
so I have 25 missile launchers
I need to move.

24:58.243 --> 25:00.328
You got 24 hours
to find me a buyer,

25:00.379 --> 25:03.881
and he better be
carrying my Klee.

25:03.966 --> 25:07.868
If you don't deliver,
there'll be no more chances.

25:07.920 --> 25:10.672
You'll be dead.

25:24.694 --> 25:27.070
Calder,
I have one day.

25:27.155 --> 25:29.952
How am I going find someone who
wants to buy 25 missile launchers?

25:30.020 --> 25:33.356
Damn, Annie, when you
make a move, you go big.

25:33.423 --> 25:35.275
Yeah, well,
it wasn't exactly my idea.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.592
Listen,
it'll be fine.

25:36.644 --> 25:38.778
I know a guy
in Hamburg, Tarel Birkin.

25:38.863 --> 25:41.430
He spent time gathering intel
on Kurdish terror cells.

25:41.482 --> 25:42.982
Has he done
this kind of work before?

25:43.067 --> 25:44.901
Tarel's solid.
He's definitely

25:44.952 --> 25:47.103
the best man available
in this time frame.

25:48.405 --> 25:51.074
I'll get him
on the next plane to Vienna.

26:01.252 --> 26:02.669
From: Number unknown.

26:02.753 --> 26:05.255
"I hear the woods are nice
this time of day."

26:07.508 --> 26:09.292
From: Number unknown.

26:09.343 --> 26:12.512
"Need bio,
Tarel Birkin, Hamburg Station.

26:12.596 --> 26:15.348
Urgent."

26:15.432 --> 26:17.150
Birkin only worked
at the Ankara station

26:17.234 --> 26:18.318
for nine months,

26:18.402 --> 26:20.436
though he was
focused on the PKK.

26:20.487 --> 26:23.323
He wrote cables
for al-Qaeda Kurdish battalions.

26:23.407 --> 26:25.308
Nine months?
That's it?

26:25.359 --> 26:28.328
The guy's green, Annie.
You have to test him hard.

26:28.412 --> 26:31.314
Actually, no.
Leave Vienna now.

26:31.365 --> 26:33.249
This is a set-up.
At the very least,

26:33.317 --> 26:35.651
this is cowboy bullshit
on Calder's part.

26:35.703 --> 26:37.653
- You have to abort this mission.
- I can't.

26:37.705 --> 26:39.505
Birkin's coming here.
I can't ditch him.

26:39.590 --> 26:41.257
- It'll tip Calder off.
- To what, the fact

26:41.325 --> 26:43.245
that he's taken unnecessary
risks with your life?

26:43.260 --> 26:46.930
- I don't see the problem.
- Stavros was Henry's asset.

26:46.997 --> 26:50.717
We could get intel on Solstar
or the Medellin bombing.

26:50.801 --> 26:52.185
If you're not gonna
take my advice,

26:52.269 --> 26:54.137
why did you buy a burner phone
and call me?

26:54.188 --> 26:55.471
'Cause I needed to know
what I was up against

26:55.522 --> 26:57.840
with Tarel Birkin.
And I knew you would tell me.

26:57.891 --> 26:59.809
And I'm also telling you
to get out of Vienna.

26:59.860 --> 27:02.511
Yeah, well, I can't.
I'm too close.

27:02.563 --> 27:04.063
- Annie, wait a minute--
- I gotta go.

27:04.148 --> 27:06.199
Annie.

27:08.818 --> 27:10.786
I want to help
with Annie's mission.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.705
She tell you
what's happening?

27:12.789 --> 27:14.423
I'm out of the loop
on her side.

27:14.491 --> 27:15.791
Good.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.711
Then get back to Hummingbird
until I say otherwise.

27:21.465 --> 27:23.966
I checked into Tarel Birkin.
He's in way over his head.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.935
So you talked to her?

27:26.002 --> 27:28.854
You are sending him and Annie
straight into a buzz saw.

27:28.939 --> 27:31.857
You're dead wrong.
I worked with Birkin myself.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.943
Served four months
with him in Berlin.

27:34.010 --> 27:37.146
I saw your record, you haven't
worked in Berlin in five years.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.314
How well
could you know him?

27:38.365 --> 27:40.483
At best, Calder,
this is a Hail Mary.

27:40.534 --> 27:41.517
Okay.
Man, come on,

27:41.568 --> 27:42.785
let's do this in private.
Come on.

27:42.852 --> 27:44.070
What, your open door policy
doesn't apply

27:44.154 --> 27:45.354
when you're getting called
on your shit?

27:45.405 --> 27:46.739
Watch yourself,
Anderson.

27:46.823 --> 27:51.994
You are compromising
the safety of two operatives.

27:52.045 --> 27:55.381
You know what's compromising
Annie's safety?

27:55.465 --> 27:59.385
Sharing mission intel
during phone sex.

28:02.923 --> 28:05.257
If anything happens to her,
you're going down.

28:05.342 --> 28:09.061
I don't care what your job is
or who you're working for.

28:21.191 --> 28:22.742
What does
the Court Jester say?

28:22.826 --> 28:25.394
He serves
at the pleasure of the king.

28:25.445 --> 28:28.397
Come in, Tarel.
We don't have a lot of time.

28:32.002 --> 28:33.202
I've been studying
my cover

28:33.253 --> 28:34.537
ever since I got the call
from Mr. Michaels.

28:34.588 --> 28:36.505
Huh,
we'll see how well.

28:36.573 --> 28:39.258
You're a Kurdish terrorist
working out of a cell in Ankara.

28:39.343 --> 28:42.294
My name is Mirko Baradost.
I've been in the PKK since 16.

28:42.379 --> 28:43.546
- Where were you born?
- Diyarbakir.

28:43.597 --> 28:44.637
What does your brother do?

28:44.681 --> 28:45.965
Omar is a mechanic
in Istanbul.

28:46.049 --> 28:47.416
Your grammar school
teacher's name?

28:47.467 --> 28:49.251
Gabar Zaragosh.
He taught me Turkish.

28:49.302 --> 28:52.138
I still see him in the bar
in my neighborhood.

28:53.590 --> 28:56.091
- Who's the leader of the PKK?
- Murat Karayilan.

28:56.143 --> 28:58.227
- What's his assistant's name?
- Fenel Abdullah.

28:58.278 --> 29:02.231
- What's Fenel's nickname?
- Keci.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.432
It's Gulakam.

29:03.483 --> 29:06.769
Gulakam.
Right, I remember.

29:06.820 --> 29:08.571
Where are these
missile launchers going?

29:08.622 --> 29:12.208
We have a building behind
the produce market in Cankaya.

29:12.275 --> 29:14.827
- Cankaya?
- Yes, the produce market.

29:14.911 --> 29:18.080
The produce market in Cankaya
closed three months ago.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.382
I'm sorry, Tarel,
this isn't going to work.

29:19.449 --> 29:20.916
- No, I think I can do this.
- You're good.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.084
You're not perfect.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.086
If Dion Stavros
even smells

29:24.137 --> 29:25.721
that you're not
who you say you are,

29:25.789 --> 29:27.289
we're both dead.

29:27.340 --> 29:31.844
My 24 hours are up.
I'm aborting this mission.

29:31.928 --> 29:34.847
Let's both just go home.

31:08.391 --> 31:09.525
Ugh!

31:17.667 --> 31:20.619
Excuse me.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.258
Sorry
I'm a little bit late.

31:28.879 --> 31:31.797
Tell your boss to be
a little less paranoid.

31:31.882 --> 31:35.918
His buyer is here,
Teo Braga.

31:37.554 --> 31:40.389
Make the call.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.932
How did you know
I was here?

31:51.535 --> 31:53.402
How did you know
I needed your help?

31:53.453 --> 31:55.621
Auggie called me.

31:55.705 --> 31:59.208
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32:01.424 --> 32:04.195
We have Coke, Sprite,

32:04.547 --> 32:07.681
- or Almdudler.
- Almdudler, definitely.

32:12.638 --> 32:14.755
I was surprised to hear
the guy who beat me up

32:14.840 --> 32:17.041
in Medellin
is your handler now.

32:17.092 --> 32:18.208
Calder?

32:18.260 --> 32:19.727
You're not the only one
who's surprised.

32:19.811 --> 32:23.347
What didn't surprise me
is his plan had holes.

32:23.398 --> 32:26.567
Auggie, obviously,
feels the same way.

32:26.652 --> 32:31.322
What I don't understand is
how'd you get to Vienna so fast?

32:31.389 --> 32:33.557
- I was nearby.
- Where?

32:33.609 --> 32:37.778
Close enough to be here
in 24 hours.

32:37.863 --> 32:41.582
Well, thank you, Teo.

32:43.452 --> 32:45.036
You helped me
in Medellin.

32:45.087 --> 32:47.571
We need to work
together.

32:47.623 --> 32:49.373
Henry wants to destroy
your father,

32:49.424 --> 32:52.076
and part of that
is destroying you.

32:52.127 --> 32:55.296
I have my own ways
of working.

32:55.380 --> 32:59.300
He funded
the Solstar bombing.

32:59.384 --> 33:01.752
We have to go.

33:01.803 --> 33:04.522
Stavros must be waiting.
Let's go.

33:21.373 --> 33:24.375
- Welcome to my home, Annie.
- Hello, Dion.

33:26.244 --> 33:29.163
Is that my Paul Klee?

33:39.891 --> 33:41.809
I must admit,

33:41.893 --> 33:44.011
I was very surprised
when Gunter called me.

33:44.096 --> 33:45.312
I've been very impressed

33:45.397 --> 33:49.066
with what the Puma has achieved
in Colombia.

33:49.134 --> 33:50.434
How close is he?

33:50.485 --> 33:56.190
He's just downstairs.
Where are the missile launchers?

33:56.274 --> 34:00.194
25 launchers
in those two vans.

34:14.676 --> 34:17.628
Come on up.

34:20.297 --> 34:22.800
I have another proposition
for you.

34:22.851 --> 34:25.268
Now that I've proven myself
to you again,

34:25.335 --> 34:28.272
I want your business
going forward.

34:30.891 --> 34:33.476
I'll give you the number
of a friend in Africa

34:33.527 --> 34:37.063
after we're done today.

34:41.870 --> 34:43.404
Welcome, Mr. Braga.

34:43.487 --> 34:45.522
You must be tired
after your journey.

34:45.574 --> 34:46.991
May I offer you a seat?

34:47.042 --> 34:48.525
Where are
my missiles launchers?

34:48.577 --> 34:50.527
Outside in vans,
awaiting your inspection.

34:50.579 --> 34:52.463
I don't need
to inspect them.

34:52.530 --> 34:54.882
If they not what you say,
I'll find you.

34:54.966 --> 34:57.334
I like
how you do business.

34:57.385 --> 35:00.471
I, however,
shall inspect my payment.

35:00.538 --> 35:02.372
Of course.

35:09.898 --> 35:11.849
Seems in order to me.

35:13.068 --> 35:14.101
Whoa!

35:19.908 --> 35:21.575
What are you doing?

35:21.660 --> 35:24.078
I told you,
we have different missions.

35:24.162 --> 35:26.747
Now we're never gonna find out
what Henry wanted from him.

35:26.832 --> 35:30.034
Stavros wanted to sell weapons
to the ALC.

35:30.085 --> 35:32.570
I was not going to
let that happen.

35:32.637 --> 35:35.573
Maybe he has a computer
or something.

35:54.226 --> 35:56.694
I'm sorry, Annie.

36:32.550 --> 36:34.894
Hey, stranger.

36:34.895 --> 36:37.013
Welcome home.

36:39.100 --> 36:42.719
- Auggie, I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

36:42.770 --> 36:44.554
Thanks for always
being my handler.

36:44.605 --> 36:46.489
I know it wasn't easy
to make that call.

36:46.557 --> 36:48.108
Sorry he smashed
the phone.

36:48.192 --> 36:51.227
I had a look at Stavros's cell
on the flight home.

36:51.278 --> 36:52.599
Tried to pull off
whatever I could

36:52.663 --> 36:54.030
before handing it over
to Calder.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.281
Great, maybe
we'll find something.

36:55.366 --> 36:56.583
We'll finish this later.

36:56.667 --> 36:59.119
Annie, come with me.

36:59.203 --> 37:00.787
I'm sorry,
are Annie and I

37:00.871 --> 37:03.790
also not allowed to speak
in the office?

37:07.928 --> 37:09.879
I'm not high on his list
right now.

37:09.930 --> 37:11.914
I don't think I am either.

37:17.805 --> 37:19.806
What the hell happened
over there?

37:19.890 --> 37:23.143
You killed Stavros and
the bodyguard in self-defense,

37:23.227 --> 37:25.762
but why were you
in the apartment at all

37:25.813 --> 37:28.598
if you sent Birkin
back to Hamburg?

37:28.649 --> 37:30.933
His men overpowered me
and brought me there.

37:30.985 --> 37:32.235
It was either them or me.

37:32.286 --> 37:34.070
Ah, Tarel could have
made it work.

37:34.121 --> 37:36.289
And killing Stavros
doesn't exactly leave us

37:36.373 --> 37:37.991
with an abundance of intel.
What about the cell phone?

37:38.075 --> 37:39.159
It must have something.

37:39.243 --> 37:40.794
Nothing actionable on it
whatsoever,

37:40.878 --> 37:42.162
but a guy as paranoid
as Stavros

37:42.246 --> 37:43.913
probably changed out phones
every couple days.

37:43.964 --> 37:46.082
Hmm.

37:48.285 --> 37:51.888
Anything else unusual
happen over there?

37:51.955 --> 37:54.123
Anything
you want to mention?

37:54.175 --> 37:56.176
No.

37:56.260 --> 37:58.478
What about the Interpol team
who cleaned the apartment?

37:58.562 --> 38:00.563
They didn't find
anything.

38:00.631 --> 38:02.182
Though the missile launchers
were in the vans out front

38:02.266 --> 38:03.466
like you said.
Well, that's something,

38:03.517 --> 38:05.351
- isn't it?
- Except your count was off.

38:05.436 --> 38:09.105
There were only
20 missile launchers, not 25.

38:09.156 --> 38:10.406
What does that mean?

38:10.474 --> 38:13.693
It means you get into business
with arms dealers,

38:13.778 --> 38:16.329
trust goes out the window.

38:20.918 --> 38:25.004
By the way,
I'm keeping you in the NOC.

38:25.089 --> 38:26.422
Why?
The mission's over.

38:26.490 --> 38:27.590
Don't want to waste
a good cover.

38:27.658 --> 38:28.758
You're gonna move
into a new apartment

38:28.826 --> 38:31.678
in Kalorama Heights.

38:32.963 --> 38:34.714
So you don't think
it was a trap?

38:34.799 --> 38:35.998
It's tough to say.

38:36.050 --> 38:38.051
If Stavros only wanted
to kill me,

38:38.135 --> 38:39.352
he had
plenty of chances.

38:39.436 --> 38:40.670
Maybe he just wanted
to put you on the hook

38:40.721 --> 38:42.021
for those five missing
missile launchers.

38:42.106 --> 38:44.858
Maybe the count really
was off, like Calder said.

38:44.942 --> 38:47.009
Or that's what
he wants us to think.

38:47.061 --> 38:50.146
I think he's testing us.
Henry?

38:50.197 --> 38:52.031
And Calder.

38:53.450 --> 38:56.686
Well, we have something
they don't have.

38:56.737 --> 38:59.155
Yeah?
What's that?

38:59.206 --> 39:02.792
I have you,
and you have me.

39:05.246 --> 39:08.414
Yeah, you do.

39:08.499 --> 39:11.384
So sounds like you're moving
into a new place.

39:11.468 --> 39:14.754
Yeah, importer/exporters
keep really weird hours.

39:14.839 --> 39:16.589
Sometimes they stay out
until the middle of the night

39:16.674 --> 39:18.424
driving around
in their fancy cars.

39:18.509 --> 39:21.094
Sometimes they even
pick up sexy blind guys.

39:21.178 --> 39:23.513
I can keep playing
this game of charades

39:23.564 --> 39:26.900
as long as we need to.

39:35.058 --> 39:37.744
The night I wore
this dress to the opera,

39:37.828 --> 39:42.398
I was hoping I'd have another
fancy occasion to put it on.

39:42.449 --> 39:46.569
Then I thought,
"why wait?"

40:00.184 --> 40:02.268
Wow.

40:02.353 --> 40:04.721
There's only one problem.
Mm?

40:04.772 --> 40:07.256
I'm gonna have a hard time
waiting for you to take it off.

40:16.233 --> 40:19.152
You have got to be
kidding me.

40:23.607 --> 40:27.543
It's Henry Wilcox.
He wants to meet.

40:44.762 --> 40:49.649
How was Vienna?
Did you enjoy <i>La Traviata?</i>

40:49.733 --> 40:52.301
I did, actually.
It was beautiful.

40:52.353 --> 40:56.322
Interesting title,
wouldn't you agree?

40:56.407 --> 41:00.360
<i>"La Traviata"</i> translates
to "The woman who strayed."

41:02.246 --> 41:04.647
Did I interrupt something?
Apologies,

41:04.698 --> 41:08.818
but I felt this was news
that affected us all.

41:10.487 --> 41:13.656
Seth Newman
was found in Virginia,

41:13.707 --> 41:16.659
extremely dead.

41:18.829 --> 41:21.330
That's terrible.

41:21.382 --> 41:22.832
What happened?

41:22.883 --> 41:25.852
His body was found washed up
on the banks of the Potomac.

41:25.936 --> 41:28.671
FBI's already on it.

41:28.722 --> 41:32.675
Rest assured that they will
solve this soon enough.

41:37.848 --> 41:41.985
Good night, Annie.
Don't want to keep you.
