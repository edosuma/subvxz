00:01.348 --> 00:04.146
<i>Previously on Stargate SG-1.</i>

00:04.217 --> 00:06.151
So you guys are ex-NID.

00:08.622 --> 00:10.556
Calling yourselves
The Trust now, right?

00:10.624 --> 00:12.649
You try to shut down the SGC.

00:12.726 --> 00:15.889
You make this big speech about how much
you hate secret organizations.

00:15.962 --> 00:18.795
Then you jump in bed with the NID.
What is that?

00:18.865 --> 00:21.663
- Consider your resignation accepted, Bob.
- You can't do that.

00:21.735 --> 00:24.465
Oh, please. I got enough on you
to have you shot.

00:24.538 --> 00:26.369
There's no one here.
We got all the exits covered.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.930
There's no way they
could have gotten out.

00:28.008 --> 00:29.498
How is that possible?

00:34.314 --> 00:36.339
This is the ship
Osiris left behind.

00:36.416 --> 00:38.475
If you hadn't caught her, we never
would have had this opportunity.

00:38.552 --> 00:41.248
- They're trying to run, sir.
- Damn it.

01:36.643 --> 01:38.577
Bad news.

01:38.645 --> 01:40.738
You're out of scotch.

01:42.983 --> 01:45.577
Well, if I'd known
you were coming...

01:45.652 --> 01:47.643
I'd have hidden the good stuff.

01:49.723 --> 01:52.920
If you'd known I was coming, I doubt
I'd have made it through the door.

01:59.099 --> 02:00.589
Who are you calling?

02:00.667 --> 02:02.601
Local sheriff's
a friend of mine.

02:02.669 --> 02:05.433
I may be disgraced...

02:05.505 --> 02:08.065
but I'm not wanted
for any crimes.

02:09.409 --> 02:11.343
Breaking and entering?

02:14.414 --> 02:15.904
It's ringing.

02:21.087 --> 02:23.180
Now you can listen
to what I have to say.

02:32.132 --> 02:33.690
For God's sake.

02:36.470 --> 02:38.665
You need to start
trusting me, Jack.

02:40.974 --> 02:42.532
No, I really don't.

02:42.609 --> 02:44.975
Yes, you really do.

02:47.347 --> 02:49.941
The fate of the planet
depends on it.

03:58.318 --> 04:00.252
<i>Hello?</i>

04:00.320 --> 04:03.585
<i>- Andy? It's Jack.
- Hey, what's up?</i>

04:06.560 --> 04:09.358
<i>Jack? Hello?</i>

04:09.429 --> 04:12.694
I was just checking on Friday-
making sure we're still on for poker.

04:12.766 --> 04:13.790
<i>Yeah, you bet.</i>

04:13.867 --> 04:15.266
<i>- I'll bring the beer.
- All right.</i>

04:15.335 --> 04:17.462
<i>- See you then.
- See you.</i>

04:19.639 --> 04:21.266
Wise decision.

04:26.613 --> 04:29.104
You've got three minutes...

04:30.450 --> 04:33.476
before I shoot you
as an intruder in my home.

04:35.655 --> 04:37.589
Same old Jack O'Neill-

04:37.657 --> 04:39.591
although I hear
you're a general now.

04:39.659 --> 04:41.593
Congratulations.

04:43.196 --> 04:45.790
All right then.
Straight to the point.

04:47.667 --> 04:50.830
You want to take down The Trust.
I can help you.

04:50.904 --> 04:54.067
I'm sorry.
I must have missed an episode.

04:54.140 --> 04:56.074
I thought you guys
were working together.

04:56.142 --> 04:58.235
After I was forced to resign
as vice president...

04:58.311 --> 05:01.678
my relationship
with the organization changed.

05:01.748 --> 05:04.216
Meaning, you were
no longer useful...

05:04.284 --> 05:06.275
so they kicked you out
on your ass.

05:06.353 --> 05:08.344
That's a rather crude way
of putting it...

05:08.421 --> 05:11.948
but yes.

05:12.025 --> 05:14.653
Why didn't they
just shoot you?

05:14.728 --> 05:17.322
Believe me, that was a consideration-
which is why...

05:17.397 --> 05:20.025
when they requested
a meeting a few days ago...

05:20.100 --> 05:23.866
I suggested a nice
public venue.

05:27.774 --> 05:31.835
They made me a very
interesting offer.

05:35.281 --> 05:38.045
In exchange
for a large cash payment...

05:38.118 --> 05:42.987
The Trust wants me to arrange
a meeting with General Miroslav Kiselev-

05:43.056 --> 05:45.047
the Russian defense minister.

05:45.125 --> 05:48.891
I thought they already had connections
with the Russian military.

05:48.962 --> 05:51.055
This isn't just a connection.

05:51.131 --> 05:53.964
Kiselev exercises
operational authority...

05:54.034 --> 05:56.059
over all of Russia's
armed forces...

05:56.136 --> 05:59.697
including their nuclear arsenal.

05:59.773 --> 06:02.537
And he just happens
to be a good friend of yours.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.674
After the fall of Communism,
he was one of a number of officers...

06:09.749 --> 06:12.843
assigned to pursue secret talks
with the West...

06:12.919 --> 06:15.012
aimed at military cooperation.

06:15.088 --> 06:18.888
He was a hard-liner even then.

06:18.958 --> 06:21.688
His country was falling apart,
but he came at us...

06:21.761 --> 06:24.025
as though we were the ones
at a disadvantage.

06:26.099 --> 06:29.591
He and I developed a mutual respect.

06:30.937 --> 06:32.871
What does The Trust
want with him?

06:32.939 --> 06:35.464
Well, they wouldn't give me
any specifics, but they know...

06:35.542 --> 06:38.375
we entered into a deal with the Russians
for control of the gate...

06:38.445 --> 06:41.209
and they also know that there's
a growing sentiment in Moscow...

06:41.281 --> 06:43.681
that we haven't been keeping up
our end of the bargain.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.344
You think they're trying
to turn the Russians against us?

06:46.419 --> 06:49.047
It's ambitious, I know,
even for The Trust...

06:49.122 --> 06:51.215
but from what I hear...

06:51.291 --> 06:55.091
after you put a crimp in their little plan
to use symbiote poison...

06:55.161 --> 06:58.722
to wipe out the Goa'uld,
there's been a change of attitude.

06:58.798 --> 07:03.326
They're no longer willing to stay
in the shadows and bide their time.

07:03.403 --> 07:05.633
They want to make
a direct grab for power.

07:07.540 --> 07:10.304
That's why I came to you.

07:10.376 --> 07:14.210
Yes, you've always struck me
as the hero type.

07:20.086 --> 07:22.520
You may question my methods...

07:22.589 --> 07:25.558
but everything I did
was for God and country.

07:26.926 --> 07:29.190
For The Trust to ally themselves
with a foreign power...

07:29.262 --> 07:31.662
against the United States
of America-

07:31.731 --> 07:33.665
Well, that's just something
I can't condone.

07:33.733 --> 07:36.201
Kinsey, please.

07:36.269 --> 07:39.033
Spare me the diatribe.

07:39.105 --> 07:41.767
They kicked you when you were down,
and you want revenge.

07:41.841 --> 07:43.775
It's as simple as that.

07:43.843 --> 07:47.040
The truth is,
my motives are irrelevant.

07:47.113 --> 07:50.879
The Trust has become
an imminent threat...

07:50.950 --> 07:53.043
to the sovereignty
of this nation.

07:53.119 --> 07:55.053
Now...

07:55.121 --> 07:57.282
what are you
gonna do about it?

08:00.426 --> 08:02.417
<i>What would happen
if The Trust...</i>

08:02.495 --> 08:04.690
<i>actually convinced the Russians
to back out of our deal?</i>

08:04.764 --> 08:06.698
Well, that would be
a problem.

08:06.766 --> 08:08.700
Technically, the gate's
only here on loan.

08:08.768 --> 08:10.702
If the Russians decide they want it back,
things could get sticky.

08:10.770 --> 08:13.000
Is it possible
Kinsey is simply lying?

08:13.072 --> 08:16.838
That is always possible.

08:16.910 --> 08:19.208
Has he asked for anything
in return for the information?

08:19.279 --> 08:20.871
Protection.

08:20.947 --> 08:24.280
Makes sense. If he doesn't cooperate,
The Trust will kill him.

08:24.350 --> 08:26.284
Maybe he should cooperate.

08:26.352 --> 08:28.843
This could be our chance
to get somebody on the inside-

08:28.922 --> 08:31.152
infiltrate the organization.

08:37.063 --> 08:41.625
- You want me to wear a wire?
- That's the deal.

08:41.701 --> 08:44.727
I am not a spy.

08:44.804 --> 08:47.272
Think of it this way.

08:47.340 --> 08:50.798
If you don't do what they want,
they'll kill you.

08:51.878 --> 08:54.676
If you don't do
what we want...

08:54.747 --> 08:56.237
we'll let 'em.

08:57.717 --> 08:59.776
Well, that's as good
as pulling the trigger yourself.

08:59.853 --> 09:02.083
I thought Stargate Command
didn't do that sort of thing.

09:02.155 --> 09:05.352
Well, we're under
new management.

09:08.027 --> 09:10.018
All right, let's test it.

09:10.063 --> 09:11.997
How's it looking?

09:12.065 --> 09:14.932
- We've got picture.
- Let's have your belt.

09:15.001 --> 09:16.491
Why?

09:16.569 --> 09:18.503
Because you'll be
wearing this one instead.

09:18.571 --> 09:22.871
The buckle contains a GPS receiver unit
that'll allow us to track your movements.

09:22.942 --> 09:24.739
When we're done
I want that back.

09:25.912 --> 09:29.177
They've arranged to meet you
at a remote location.

09:29.249 --> 09:31.183
My guess is they'll have you leave
your car, and then they'll...

09:31.251 --> 09:33.879
drive you to a second location where
the actual meeting will take place.

09:33.953 --> 09:37.445
We're gonna have to keep back a fair
distance so as not to arouse suspicion...

09:37.523 --> 09:39.684
but we will be monitoring
your conversations...

09:39.759 --> 09:43.354
by means of this listening device that
we fitted into the collar of your shirt.

09:43.429 --> 09:45.522
We've got a strike team
with us.

09:45.598 --> 09:48.624
They will be ready to move in
at the first sign of trouble.

09:48.701 --> 09:50.692
Now in the event
that something does go wrong...

09:50.770 --> 09:53.204
I suggest we come up
with a preestablished signal...

09:53.273 --> 09:55.901
preferably a code word that'll
let us know you're in trouble.

09:57.176 --> 09:59.804
How about something simple,
like "help"?

10:00.947 --> 10:03.040
How about something
a little less obvious...

10:03.116 --> 10:05.050
like "red"?

10:06.119 --> 10:07.552
Whatever.

10:07.620 --> 10:10.919
Don't be too direct fishing for
information. Let them do the talking.

10:10.990 --> 10:13.891
Get out of my way.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.757
I know what to do.

10:33.112 --> 10:34.602
You're late.

10:37.650 --> 10:40.448
- You're kidding, right?
- Afraid not.

10:57.503 --> 10:59.596
<i>He's on the move.</i>

10:59.672 --> 11:01.606
Understood.

11:08.448 --> 11:11.542
<i>So how long is this
sight-seeing trip gonna last?</i>

11:11.617 --> 11:13.551
<i>We'll let you know.</i>

11:28.401 --> 11:30.130
They've turned off
the main road.

11:58.131 --> 12:00.065
They've stopped.

12:13.780 --> 12:15.270
<i>This way.</i>

12:31.631 --> 12:35.692
Bob, good to see you again.
Sorry about the blindfold.

12:40.973 --> 12:42.941
What can we get you
to drink?

12:43.009 --> 12:44.943
What are you having?

12:45.011 --> 12:50.244
- Vodka tonic.
- In that case, I'll have a scotch. No ice.

12:50.316 --> 12:53.444
We're glad you finally agreed
to a private meeting.

12:55.354 --> 12:58.619
We were afraid you might be
holding a grudge against us.

13:00.493 --> 13:04.088
You mean because you abandoned me
at the moment I needed you the most?

13:05.932 --> 13:10.460
<i>You were a liability, Bob,
an embarrassment.</i>

13:11.304 --> 13:13.465
I think you've
got that backwards.

13:13.539 --> 13:16.599
I was only forced to resign
as vice president...

13:16.676 --> 13:19.008
because they found out
about my relationship with you.

13:19.078 --> 13:21.979
Either way, you were
no longer useful to us.

13:23.716 --> 13:25.479
You would have done the same.

13:27.120 --> 13:30.886
Maybe, but when
I cut someone loose...

13:32.125 --> 13:35.151
I don't go back to them,
groveling for favors.

13:35.228 --> 13:37.287
You say what's on your mind,
I'll give you that.

13:37.363 --> 13:41.356
Under other circumstances,
I might be worried about...

13:41.434 --> 13:43.732
winding up like
one of your trophies on the wall.

13:43.803 --> 13:45.794
But you've already
made it clear...

13:45.872 --> 13:49.103
that you need me, so I don't have
anything to worry about, do I?

13:53.079 --> 13:56.242
<i>- We're losing video.
- It's true, we do need you...</i>

13:56.315 --> 13:58.283
<i>- but not for what you think.
- They jamming us?</i>

13:58.351 --> 14:00.285
I don't know.

14:00.353 --> 14:04.813
- What are you talking about?
- Show him.

14:22.942 --> 14:26.810
<i>This is why
we need you, Bob.</i>

14:30.116 --> 14:32.880
What the hell
is going on here?

14:34.620 --> 14:36.713
They are definitely jamming us.

14:36.789 --> 14:38.222
Teal'c, we've lost audio.
Move in.

14:45.965 --> 14:48.832
- Can you get the signal back?
- Can't get past the interference.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.410
Clear!

15:18.931 --> 15:21.024
Clear over here, sir.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.364
They beamed out.

15:23.436 --> 15:26.405
This is starting
to become a habit.

15:29.642 --> 15:31.610
<i>If the Al'kesh is in orbit...</i>

15:31.677 --> 15:34.373
they must have fixed the cloak,
because SSN hasn't picked them up.

15:34.447 --> 15:36.779
- What about the locator beacons?
- We're running a search...

15:36.849 --> 15:38.908
through the NSA
satellite system...

15:38.985 --> 15:42.386
but all they'd have to do to avoid
detection is change the frequency.

15:42.455 --> 15:44.548
Odds are we're not
gonna find anything.

15:45.925 --> 15:48.393
Well, the Pentagon's
been apprised of the situation.

15:48.461 --> 15:52.329
<i>They're launching Prometheus
in about four hours. I want you on board.</i>

15:52.398 --> 15:55.959
There's a C-17 waiting
for you at Peterson.

15:56.035 --> 15:58.401
Understood.

15:58.471 --> 16:00.564
Sir, I've been going
over the sensor logs...

16:00.640 --> 16:02.972
<i>from the last encounter between
Prometheus and the Al'kesh.</i>

16:03.042 --> 16:04.976
There were a few
small anomalies emanating...

16:05.044 --> 16:07.638
from the ship's position
before it decloaked.

16:07.713 --> 16:09.874
They didn't register because
we didn't know to look for them.

16:09.949 --> 16:12.008
But I could create
a program that would...

16:12.084 --> 16:14.609
key the sensors to those
particular readings.

16:14.687 --> 16:18.350
I was just going
to suggest that.

16:18.424 --> 16:21.757
- So we'd be able to detect a cloaked ship?
- Well, it's not that simple.

16:21.827 --> 16:24.352
These anomalies
are very difficult to detect.

16:24.430 --> 16:27.194
It might have just been a fluke
that we picked them up the first time.

16:27.266 --> 16:30.997
The effect is also mimicked
by certain types of cosmic radiation.

16:31.070 --> 16:34.198
But I still think
it might improve our odds.

16:34.273 --> 16:36.503
So instead of a million to one-

16:36.575 --> 16:38.668
Maybe 10,000 to one.

16:40.513 --> 16:42.879
- Improvement.
- Yeah.

16:42.948 --> 16:45.041
I'll need a few hours
to create the program.

16:45.117 --> 16:46.778
Fine.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.885
- I have to pick up my dry cleaning.
- You're on a flight...

16:54.960 --> 16:58.293
- to Moscow in half an hour.
- I am?

16:58.364 --> 17:02.664
Yes, you are. Colonel Chekov's people
will meet you there.

17:02.735 --> 17:06.501
Will you please try to find out
what the hell's going on?

17:06.572 --> 17:11.202
And if you get a chance,
hook up with this General Kiselev.

17:11.277 --> 17:14.474
Jack, they know we're onto them.
They may just abort the mission.

17:14.547 --> 17:18.074
No, the way Kinsey was talking, it sounds
like they're looking for a big score here.

17:18.150 --> 17:21.244
And what if he won't
cooperate with them?

17:21.320 --> 17:26.724
- Kinsey'll do what's best for Kinsey.
- Yeah.

17:42.208 --> 17:43.698
Sir, download is complete.

17:43.776 --> 17:46.370
Colonel Carter's new sensor program
is online and operational.

17:46.445 --> 17:49.744
- All right, begin search pattern alpha.
- Yes, sir.

18:01.127 --> 18:04.585
Hi. I'm here
to see Captain Voronkov.

18:04.663 --> 18:06.631
There is no
Captain Voronkov here.

18:07.466 --> 18:10.731
Oh. That's strange.
The guy down the hall said-

18:10.803 --> 18:14.398
I am Captain Voronkova-
Daria Voronkova.

18:14.473 --> 18:18.603
- You must be DanielJackson.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

18:18.677 --> 18:21.009
I was told I'd be meeting
Colonel Chekov's right-hand man...

18:21.080 --> 18:23.776
- so naturally l-
- For my part, I expected...

18:23.849 --> 18:26.477
a drab, pasty-faced,
middle-aged academic.

18:26.552 --> 18:28.486
I too am pleasantly surprised.

18:33.259 --> 18:34.749
Your English is excellent.

18:35.895 --> 18:37.886
And how is your Russian?

18:42.868 --> 18:44.802
Okay, we stick
to English then.

18:46.305 --> 18:48.239
I will be your guide.

18:48.307 --> 18:51.902
Whatever you wish to do while you are
in Moscow, you will ask me first.

18:51.977 --> 18:53.467
I will take care of it.

18:53.546 --> 18:56.606
If you desire to meet with anyone,
I will arrange it for you.

18:56.682 --> 18:59.776
If you go out on your own,
I cannot protect you.

18:59.852 --> 19:03.845
Lie to me, or attempt to mislead me,
and I will not protect you.

19:03.923 --> 19:06.118
Okay.

19:06.192 --> 19:08.752
Have you eaten a proper lunch?

19:08.828 --> 19:11.160
- I had something on the plane.
- Then the answer is no.

19:11.230 --> 19:14.597
Good. I know a restaurant
around the corner...

19:14.667 --> 19:16.601
that serves the best salo
in Moscow.

19:16.669 --> 19:19.035
- Oh, I'm not a big fan of salo.
- Don't worry.

19:19.104 --> 19:21.834
You will acquire a taste.

19:29.248 --> 19:31.182
So what's going on?

19:31.250 --> 19:33.343
The Russians have gone
to a heightened state of alert.

19:33.419 --> 19:35.512
- Why?
- We're trying to find out.

19:35.588 --> 19:38.352
The president's called a meeting
for the joint chiefs.

19:38.424 --> 19:40.153
We're at DEFCON 3.

19:55.274 --> 19:58.471
So where, exactly,
are we going?

19:58.544 --> 20:02.537
<i>You wish to meet with General Kiselev, da?
That is where we are going.</i>

20:02.615 --> 20:05.049
You must be pretty well connected
to get to see him this quickly.

20:07.386 --> 20:10.219
- What do you know about him?
- General Miroslav Kiselev...

20:10.289 --> 20:13.747
graduated with a gold medal
from Malinovsky Tank Academy.

20:13.826 --> 20:15.987
Received the Hero of Russia...

20:16.061 --> 20:18.086
for his distinguished
leadership in Chechnya.

20:18.163 --> 20:20.859
Commanded the Carpathian
Military District's Iron Division...

20:20.933 --> 20:23.902
then the 14th Army
in the Transcaucasus Military District.

20:23.969 --> 20:26.699
He was the head
of the General Staff Academy...

20:26.772 --> 20:29.036
for five years before being appointed
to his present position.

20:29.108 --> 20:33.204
- So you've heard of him.
- Kiselev is suspicious...

20:33.279 --> 20:36.077
of American global influence
and highly critical...

20:36.148 --> 20:39.584
of what he calls
NATO expansion plans.

20:39.652 --> 20:42.746
You may not receive
a very warm welcome.

21:19.091 --> 21:20.581
What's goin' on?

21:20.659 --> 21:22.149
I don't know.

21:28.067 --> 21:31.366
Don't worry, Daniel.
I'll find out what's happening.

21:43.749 --> 21:45.876
Yeah, all right.

21:45.951 --> 21:47.942
Okay, get back to me
when you know something.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.954
Yeah.

21:50.022 --> 21:52.286
- Sir, Colonel Chekov's here to see you.
- Send him in.

21:57.329 --> 21:59.263
- General?
- Colonel.

21:59.331 --> 22:02.994
I was hoping you could shed
some light on the situation here.

22:03.068 --> 22:06.037
We can't seem to get a straight answer
from your government.

22:06.105 --> 22:10.769
Well, the information coming
out of Moscow is guarded at best...

22:10.843 --> 22:13.812
but my sources
in the Kremlin tell me...

22:13.879 --> 22:16.712
the Russian military
is increasing its alert status...

22:16.782 --> 22:20.309
because they think the American
administration has been compromised.

22:23.222 --> 22:25.247
Dr. Jackson,
sorry to keep you waiting.

22:25.324 --> 22:26.814
No problem.

22:26.892 --> 22:29.224
- You want to tell me what's going on?
- All in good time.

22:29.294 --> 22:30.955
Please roll up your sleeve.

22:31.964 --> 22:33.989
We need a sample
of your blood.

22:37.569 --> 22:39.059
You're kidding.

22:39.138 --> 22:42.073
Either you cooperate,
or we will take it by force.

22:47.980 --> 22:50.175
Is this a normal part of your
interrogation procedure?

22:50.249 --> 22:52.740
Depends what
you wish to know.

22:52.818 --> 22:56.254
In this case, it will answer
a very specific question.

22:56.321 --> 22:57.811
What question?

23:10.169 --> 23:12.103
What's going on?

23:12.171 --> 23:14.332
Why do you wish
to see General Kiselev?

23:14.406 --> 23:16.670
It's complicated.

23:16.742 --> 23:18.869
Surely you can
explain it to me.

23:18.944 --> 23:20.536
I think I'd rather
explain it to General Kiselev.

23:20.612 --> 23:22.102
That's not going to happen.

23:22.181 --> 23:27.050
You see, earlier today we managed to
uncover a plot against the general's life.

23:27.119 --> 23:32.113
Luckily we captured the assassin
before he could make his move.

23:36.295 --> 23:37.785
I believe you know him.

23:39.765 --> 23:42.359
Kinsey. Robert Kinsey.

23:42.434 --> 23:45.460
Former vice president
of the United States of America.

23:45.537 --> 23:47.971
That's insane. Why would Kinsey
want to kill General Kiselev?

23:48.040 --> 23:51.635
I'm afraid Mr. Kinsey
isn't exactly himself these days.

23:52.878 --> 23:56.814
<i>By stopping me, you have only
delayed the inevitable.</i>

23:58.317 --> 24:00.877
<i>Your world is doomed.</i>

24:02.421 --> 24:05.151
Now you begin to appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

24:13.265 --> 24:15.631
<i>How could Kinsey
have become a Goa'uld?</i>

24:15.701 --> 24:18.864
Five bucks says Carter
has a theory.

24:18.937 --> 24:21.531
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Huh?

24:21.607 --> 24:23.541
According
to Tok'ra intelligence...

24:23.609 --> 24:25.543
The Trust launched
at least two poison attacks...

24:25.611 --> 24:29.240
against Goa'uld-occupied worlds
after we took back the gate.

24:29.314 --> 24:30.804
That means they had to leave...

24:30.883 --> 24:32.373
the relatively safe confines
of the solar system...

24:32.451 --> 24:34.385
and head out into the galaxy...

24:34.453 --> 24:38.355
where they ran the risk
of being killed or captured.

24:38.423 --> 24:40.448
What are you suggesting?

24:40.526 --> 24:43.222
Any Goa'uld who got his hands on them
would've discovered pretty quickly...

24:43.295 --> 24:45.923
that they belonged
to a top-secret organization...

24:45.998 --> 24:48.228
with high-level connections
to some of the most powerful...

24:48.300 --> 24:50.860
governments and institutions
on this planet...

24:50.936 --> 24:54.565
including the SGC, Area 51...

24:54.640 --> 24:57.302
and maybe even the Ancient outpost
in the Antarctic.

24:57.376 --> 25:00.311
My God. You think they have
been taken as hosts...

25:00.379 --> 25:02.939
- and sent back to Earth.
- I think it's possible.

25:03.015 --> 25:05.882
They could have brought dozens-
maybe even hundreds-

25:05.951 --> 25:07.509
of symbiotes back with them.

25:07.586 --> 25:10.054
By now the entire Trust
could have been taken over.

25:10.122 --> 25:14.115
But why would the Goa'uld want
to assassinate General Kiselev?

25:14.193 --> 25:16.388
We don't know for sure
that was the plan...

25:16.461 --> 25:18.554
but if Carter's right,
Kinsey might have been trying...

25:18.630 --> 25:20.564
to get a snake
into Kiselev's head.

25:20.632 --> 25:22.566
It makes sense.

25:22.634 --> 25:25.660
From Kiselev, it's one step up
to the president of Russia.

25:25.737 --> 25:27.136
How do we know
he didn't succeed?

25:27.206 --> 25:29.174
Kinsey never met
with the general.

25:29.241 --> 25:32.210
He was arrested
before he had the chance.

25:32.277 --> 25:35.735
Well, my government feels that it is
the American administration...

25:35.814 --> 25:37.281
that has been
infiltrated by the Goa'uld...

25:37.349 --> 25:38.839
Oh, here we go.

25:38.917 --> 25:41.385
And they are insisting
that everyone in key positions-

25:41.453 --> 25:44.547
including the president-
must submit for testing.

25:47.426 --> 25:48.916
Not gonna happen.

25:48.994 --> 25:51.554
Well, then we have a problem.

25:56.301 --> 25:58.235
Thank you for getting me
out of there.

25:58.303 --> 26:00.328
It wasn't easy.

26:01.673 --> 26:05.074
Even after your blood test came back
negative, they still wanted to hold you.

26:05.978 --> 26:09.505
Yeah, not a lot of trust and goodwill
to spare right now, I guess.

26:10.582 --> 26:12.675
Listen. I need to talk to the Goa'uld.

26:13.752 --> 26:16.277
- You have to get me in to see Kinsey.
- Impossible.

26:16.355 --> 26:18.084
If we're gonna figure out what's
going on, we have to question him.

26:18.156 --> 26:21.216
He is being questioned-
by Russian Military Intelligence.

26:21.293 --> 26:23.227
Yes, and he's feeding them
a pack of lies.

26:23.295 --> 26:25.229
He's telling them the American
administration has been infiltrated...

26:25.297 --> 26:27.788
- 'cause he wants to force a confrontation.
- To what end?

26:27.866 --> 26:29.731
I don't know. That's why
we need to talk to him.

26:31.169 --> 26:32.363
Language.

26:35.574 --> 26:37.064
Daria, please.

26:40.512 --> 26:43.037
I'll see what I can do.

26:43.115 --> 26:45.276
In the meantime, stay here.

26:54.793 --> 26:57.557
Sir, we just received
another report.

26:57.629 --> 27:00.291
<i>As of 091 2, the Chinese military
have joined the Russians...</i>

27:00.365 --> 27:02.094
in an elevated state of alert.

27:03.101 --> 27:04.591
Naturally.

27:06.405 --> 27:09.841
General, I've been talking
to my contacts in the Kremlin.

27:09.908 --> 27:12.672
They tell me President Mikhailov
is not happy with the situation...

27:12.744 --> 27:16.680
but is under considerable pressure
from his military advisers.

27:16.748 --> 27:19.012
In other words,
Kiselev is running the show.

27:21.086 --> 27:23.850
Any idea how we can keep this
from going to total forces?

27:23.922 --> 27:27.881
Yes. I have many friends
in the general staff.

27:27.960 --> 27:29.928
If I can convince
enough of them...

27:29.995 --> 27:32.759
to take a united stand
against escalation...

27:32.831 --> 27:36.289
it could give our president sufficient
leverage to consider other options.

27:36.368 --> 27:39.201
And if Kiselev finds out
you're going around him...

27:39.271 --> 27:41.637
it could make things worse.

27:41.707 --> 27:44.835
At this point, I don't believe
we have much choice.

27:46.445 --> 27:47.935
Right.

28:16.575 --> 28:18.509
So what should I call you?

28:18.577 --> 28:22.035
You are unworthy to speak my name.

28:22.781 --> 28:24.681
Maybe.

28:24.750 --> 28:27.480
So I'm guessing you work
for the system lords. Am I right?

28:27.552 --> 28:29.486
I know you're not
working for Ba'al.

28:29.554 --> 28:31.044
He's too busy conquering
the galaxy...

28:31.123 --> 28:32.715
to bother with an
unimportant planet like Earth.

28:32.791 --> 28:34.725
Gotta hand it to you though.

28:34.793 --> 28:37.193
Your territories are falling one by one,
your troops are in full retreat...

28:37.262 --> 28:39.890
and you still find the time to come
and try and destroy little old us.

28:39.965 --> 28:41.899
The question is, "Why?"

28:46.104 --> 28:48.163
Captain Voronkova thinks
it's a petty need for revenge...

28:48.240 --> 28:50.174
for all the trouble
we've caused you over the years...

28:50.242 --> 28:53.211
sort of a last-ditch attempt to take us
with you before Ba'al finishes you off.

28:53.278 --> 28:55.576
I told her the system lords
weren't that pathetic. Are they?

28:55.647 --> 28:57.581
You are the one
who is pathetic.

28:57.649 --> 29:00.618
You will die never knowing
our true purpose.

29:02.220 --> 29:03.778
So there is a hidden agenda.

29:07.192 --> 29:08.853
Making progress now,
aren't we?

29:14.733 --> 29:18.328
Yeah. All right, keep me posted.

29:18.403 --> 29:22.499
Well. The Chinese are refusing
to back down and, gosh and golly...

29:22.574 --> 29:26.169
go figure, we're picking up increased
chatter from within Russia.

29:26.244 --> 29:29.008
I am still waiting to hear back
from my contacts in Moscow.

29:29.081 --> 29:31.743
And I just talked
to theJoint Chiefs.

29:33.585 --> 29:35.576
<i>We're going to DEFCON 2.</i>

29:39.191 --> 29:41.216
You know, I'm sure if we put
our heads together we'd come up...

29:41.293 --> 29:43.227
with a dozen reasons
why you'd want to wipe us out-

29:43.295 --> 29:45.229
most important being
the Ancient weapon...

29:45.297 --> 29:47.231
that you know we possess.

29:47.299 --> 29:49.927
I'm sure the system lords think if
they can get us to wipe ourselves out...

29:50.001 --> 29:51.935
they can just
step right in and take it.

29:52.003 --> 29:54.369
They're probably right,
but what I don't understand is you-

29:54.439 --> 29:56.600
why you're so willing
to sacrifice yourself.

29:56.675 --> 29:58.666
I assure you.

29:58.743 --> 30:02.907
I have no intention of dying
on this miserable planet.

30:02.981 --> 30:06.109
You're in Russian Defense headquarters.
Primary target.

30:06.184 --> 30:08.049
If you do succeed
in starting a nuclear war...

30:08.120 --> 30:09.610
you're gonna die right along
with the rest of us.

30:14.693 --> 30:16.820
Unless there's
something I'm missing.

30:16.895 --> 30:20.194
You should return to your homes
and say farewell to your loved ones.

30:20.265 --> 30:23.962
Your gods have deemed you
to be unworthy...

30:24.035 --> 30:27.300
and the hour of reckoning
is at hand.

30:27.372 --> 30:30.239
Air Force Space Command has put
all of its missile wings on alert.

30:30.308 --> 30:32.902
<i>The first B-2
left Whiteman at 0940.</i>

30:32.978 --> 30:35.913
FL SatCom sent out
an emergency action message.

30:35.981 --> 30:37.915
Nine of our missile
submarines are at sea...

30:37.983 --> 30:40.417
and the rest are preparing
for immediate sortie.

30:40.485 --> 30:42.578
The president and his team
are on their way to Andrews...

30:42.654 --> 30:45.714
where the National Airborne Command Post
is awaiting their arrival.

30:48.693 --> 30:52.254
General Kiselev found out we were
trying to rally support against him.

30:52.330 --> 30:56.266
He's already arrested several officers
on trumped-up charges.

30:56.334 --> 30:59.792
I'm afraid Dr. Jackson
may be in danger.

30:59.871 --> 31:01.805
Come on.

31:01.873 --> 31:05.365
Next to slaughtering innocents,
gloating is what you guys are all about.

31:05.443 --> 31:08.310
It must be just killing you,
just sitting there...

31:08.380 --> 31:11.042
not bragging about
your brilliant plan.

31:16.454 --> 31:18.479
- We have to get out of here now.
- Why? What is it?

31:18.557 --> 31:20.855
- They're coming for us.
- Who?

31:24.229 --> 31:25.594
You are too late.

31:32.304 --> 31:33.737
Sorry, guys. Gotta go.

31:46.017 --> 31:47.507
What is the meaning of this?

31:47.586 --> 31:49.816
<i>Dr. Jackson, welcome aboard
the Prometheus.</i>

31:49.888 --> 31:51.378
Any luck finding the Al'kesh?

31:51.456 --> 31:53.890
- None.
- Maybe he can help us.

31:54.893 --> 31:56.383
I think not.

31:56.461 --> 31:58.429
If you do not cooperate,
I will kill you.

31:58.496 --> 32:01.522
Don't you realize
what you have done?

32:01.600 --> 32:05.696
The Russians already suspect that
you've been compromised by the Goa'uld.

32:05.770 --> 32:08.295
As far as they know,
you helped me to escape.

32:09.507 --> 32:12.408
You've done more to convince them
than I ever could.

32:19.784 --> 32:21.376
Listen up, people.

32:21.453 --> 32:23.887
I just got word.

32:23.955 --> 32:27.584
The Russians have gone to a state
of full military preparedness.

32:27.659 --> 32:30.321
As of this moment, we're at DEFCON 1.

32:38.903 --> 32:40.894
The Russians will no doubt
view my abduction...

32:40.972 --> 32:42.906
as an attempt
to hide evidence...

32:42.974 --> 32:45.909
that your government has been
infiltrated by the Goa'uld.

32:46.845 --> 32:50.611
You have no choice
but to return me immediately.

32:50.682 --> 32:52.616
Yeah. See, that's the part
that I don't understand.

32:52.684 --> 32:54.083
The whole time you were down there...

32:54.152 --> 32:55.642
you were doing your best
to start a nuclear war...

32:55.720 --> 32:57.449
even though you were
right in the line of fire.

32:57.522 --> 32:59.012
Now you want to go back?

33:01.326 --> 33:02.816
He has a way out.

33:03.895 --> 33:06.295
He knows someone on the inside,
someone who can protect him.

33:07.999 --> 33:11.833
- Who is it?
- I have nothing more to say to you.

33:11.903 --> 33:14.872
We can start this again when
he's had some time to think about it.

33:14.939 --> 33:17.271
Take him to the brig.

33:22.113 --> 33:24.206
All our naval forces
have been deployed...

33:24.282 --> 33:27.877
and we've got some pretty big birds
in the air right now.

33:29.454 --> 33:33.220
Radio chatter suggests that both
your people and the Chinese...

33:33.291 --> 33:37.057
- have alerted their missile regiments.
- They're posturing.

33:37.128 --> 33:39.062
Kiselev knows that even if
he launches...

33:39.130 --> 33:41.724
an effective first strike
against your land-based forces...

33:41.800 --> 33:45.736
your sea-based missiles are already in
a position to exact extreme retribution.

33:45.804 --> 33:48.568
Yeah, that's only if he doesn't
completely lose his mind...

33:48.640 --> 33:51.234
and I'm not discounting
that possibility.

33:51.309 --> 33:54.073
As acting commander-in-chief
of the Russian armed forces...

33:54.145 --> 33:56.739
President Mikhailov
is our only hope of reeling him in.

33:56.815 --> 33:58.749
Well, we can't
get through to him.

33:58.817 --> 34:01.843
He's not even taking calls
from the White House anymore.

34:01.920 --> 34:05.549
He is convinced the Goa'uld now
control the American administration.

34:06.925 --> 34:11.021
Look. I know a few people
on his personal staff.

34:11.096 --> 34:13.030
I may be able
to get the direct line...

34:13.098 --> 34:17.194
but if we do make contact, we'll only
have a few minutes to convince him...

34:17.268 --> 34:20.032
that General Kiselev
has been misled by the Goa'uld.

34:20.105 --> 34:23.836
Now, right now, I don't see
how we're going to do that.

34:32.784 --> 34:34.479
We are in position.

34:36.354 --> 34:38.254
<i>Have they detected our presence?</i>

34:39.624 --> 34:42.718
<i>Very well.
Destroy the ship.</i>

34:42.794 --> 34:44.728
They have superior shields.

34:44.796 --> 34:47.890
If we do not succeed with the first
salvo, we will be at a disadvantage.

34:47.966 --> 34:51.060
<i>So long as he is in their hands,
he remains a liability.</i>

34:51.136 --> 34:53.070
<i>We have no choice.</i>

34:53.138 --> 34:54.628
Understood.

35:01.312 --> 35:02.802
What the hell was that?

35:11.189 --> 35:12.747
- We're under attack.
- Shields up.

35:14.025 --> 35:17.290
Shields are down to 40%.
We've lost starboard engines.

35:17.362 --> 35:20.126
Transfer power to port engines.
Give me evasive maneuvers.

35:20.198 --> 35:21.859
Bring all weapon
batteries online.

35:21.933 --> 35:23.423
<i>Bridge, this is Sergeant Larson.</i>

35:23.501 --> 35:26.800
<i>- Go ahead.
- Sorry, sir. Prisoner escaped.</i>

35:26.871 --> 35:28.361
The ring room.

35:36.381 --> 35:39.578
Please, tell me
you have something.

35:39.651 --> 35:41.551
Yes, sir, I think I do.

35:41.619 --> 35:44.554
I've been going over everything
we have on General Kiselev...

35:44.622 --> 35:46.783
and I found this.

35:46.858 --> 35:49.258
Colonel Ruslan Chernovshev.

35:49.327 --> 35:52.660
He was Kiselev's chief of staff-
his right-hand man.

35:52.730 --> 35:55.426
Three years ago, he was involved in
a plot to sell a captured symbiote...

35:55.500 --> 35:58.663
to elements ofThe Trust,
then operating within the NID.

36:00.138 --> 36:02.197
That means The Trust had a direct
connection to Kiselev.

36:02.273 --> 36:03.763
They didn't need Kinsey.

36:03.842 --> 36:06.868
He was just a pretext
to justify this confrontation...

36:06.945 --> 36:09.675
by making them think
that we'd been compromised.

36:09.747 --> 36:12.181
So ifThe Trust had access
to Kiselev...

36:12.250 --> 36:14.184
then he could have been
compromised as well.

36:14.252 --> 36:16.243
Exactly.

36:16.321 --> 36:18.255
This is a file photo...

36:18.323 --> 36:21.850
of General Kiselev
taken three years ago.

36:21.926 --> 36:23.860
And this was taken
less than a week ago...

36:23.928 --> 36:26.692
during a speech he gave
at the General Staff Academy.

36:26.764 --> 36:29.232
Notice the difference?

36:31.369 --> 36:32.859
Glasses?

36:34.539 --> 36:36.473
May I see that?

36:36.541 --> 36:38.475
We know that symbiotes
have healing power.

36:38.543 --> 36:40.977
They can cure a host body of any
number of physical shortcomings...

36:41.045 --> 36:42.979
including bad eyesight.

36:45.550 --> 36:50.044
That's it? Did it occur to you that
he might be wearing contacts?

36:50.121 --> 36:52.487
Sir, I realize
it's not a lot to go on.

36:52.557 --> 36:54.252
Have you heard
of laser surgery?

36:54.325 --> 36:57.192
- Sir-
- No, wait. Colonel Carter is right.

36:57.262 --> 37:00.663
General Kiselev suffered from glaucoma.
His vision was extremely poor.

37:00.732 --> 37:03.530
There is no possibility
he could have read...

37:03.601 --> 37:05.831
from a prepared statement
without his glasses.

37:05.904 --> 37:08.498
Sir, I think Kiselev's
a Goa'uld.

37:08.573 --> 37:11.098
I think he has been all along.

37:49.113 --> 37:50.603
Crap.

37:56.287 --> 37:58.551
We've almost got it, sir.
Stand by.

37:59.557 --> 38:01.752
Hey.

38:01.826 --> 38:04.260
How do we know Mikhailov
hasn't been infected too?

38:04.329 --> 38:06.263
We don't.

38:06.331 --> 38:09.300
But at this point,
we hardly have anything to lose.

38:09.367 --> 38:12.564
- Good point.
- We got it, sir. You're on.

38:14.572 --> 38:16.506
Mr. President,
can you hear me?

38:16.574 --> 38:18.838
<i>Colonel Chekov,
this is highly irregular.</i>

38:18.910 --> 38:23.677
Yes, sir, but these are
highly unusual circumstances.

38:23.748 --> 38:26.182
<i>Agreed. Is General O'Neill
there with you?</i>

38:26.250 --> 38:28.184
I'm here, Mr. President.

38:28.252 --> 38:30.186
<i>It's good to speak
with you again-</i>

38:30.254 --> 38:33.485
<i>although, you understand, at the
moment I cannot trust anything you say.</i>

38:33.558 --> 38:36.186
Yeah. About that-

38:36.260 --> 38:39.627
It's true. There has been
a Goa'uld infiltration.

38:39.697 --> 38:44.031
But it's not on our side.
It's on yours.

38:48.940 --> 38:51.204
<i>What is it exactly
that you are saying?</i>

38:52.410 --> 38:54.878
Let me put it this way, sir.

38:54.946 --> 38:58.541
The last time you saw
General Kiselev...

38:58.616 --> 39:02.643
did you happen to notice
if he was wearing his glasses?

39:04.722 --> 39:06.622
Shields are holding, sir.
Forty percent and steady.

39:06.691 --> 39:08.181
Then we've got 'em.

39:08.259 --> 39:10.625
Come about and prepare
to fire on my signal.

39:18.236 --> 39:21.137
I'm pleased you were able to use
my diversion to free yourself.

39:21.205 --> 39:23.002
Do you think I'm a fool?

39:23.074 --> 39:25.338
You tried to destroy
the ship...

39:25.410 --> 39:28.208
because you thought I would
reveal information about you.

39:28.279 --> 39:30.406
Of course not.
We were merely-

39:33.117 --> 39:35.984
- Open fire, all batteries.
- Yes, sir.

39:55.273 --> 39:58.538
We're sending you the relevant
documents now, Mr. President-

39:58.609 --> 40:02.443
proof of Colonel Chernovshev's
prior relationship with The Trust.

40:02.513 --> 40:04.538
Plus a list of generals
who are willing to support you...

40:04.615 --> 40:07.049
should you decide
to move against General Kiselev.

40:07.118 --> 40:10.713
<i>I must say, I'm not sure
what to make of all this.</i>

40:10.788 --> 40:14.383
Well, you could start
by trusting us.

40:14.459 --> 40:16.393
<i>And if you have been
compromised by the Goa'uld...</i>

40:16.461 --> 40:18.452
<i>I would be standing down
my forces...</i>

40:18.529 --> 40:21.054
<i>with the Americans in position
to launch an immediate attack.</i>

40:21.132 --> 40:26.536
Sir, we both know neither side
can win outright with a first strike.

40:26.604 --> 40:29.038
That's the whole point.

40:29.107 --> 40:32.565
The Goa'uld don't want a winner.
They want us to destroy each other.

40:32.643 --> 40:34.736
<i>- Why?
- We believe...</i>

40:34.812 --> 40:36.746
their ultimate goal
is to get their hands...

40:36.814 --> 40:38.782
on the Ancient
weapon in Antarctica.

40:38.850 --> 40:42.445
Sir, NPIC is reporting
visuals...

40:42.520 --> 40:44.750
from Russian missile site 537.

40:44.822 --> 40:47.586
Silo doors are open.
Evidence of a firefight on the ground.

40:47.658 --> 40:51.059
Oh, my God. Kiselev is trying
to launch without authorization.

40:51.129 --> 40:55.429
Mr. President, you are about
to lose control of your own forces.

40:55.500 --> 40:59.266
<i>- You have to do something right now.
- I am thinking-</i>

41:00.772 --> 41:02.262
What happened?

41:02.340 --> 41:05.434
We lost the connection.
The line is down.

41:08.880 --> 41:12.043
Sir, the Al'kesh is no longer making
evasive maneuvers or returning fire.

41:12.116 --> 41:13.777
We have a clear shot.

41:14.986 --> 41:16.476
Stand by.

41:21.793 --> 41:23.761
Why are we not returning fire?

41:33.437 --> 41:36.634
- They're powering weapons.
- Take them out.

41:47.051 --> 41:48.484
Target destroyed.

42:13.044 --> 42:14.534
Get me Washington.

42:14.612 --> 42:16.876
General, wait!

42:16.948 --> 42:20.315
- We're out of time, Colonel.
- Please.

42:27.258 --> 42:31.752
Sir, NPIC is reporting
new visuals at 537.

42:32.797 --> 42:34.389
Silo doors are closing.

42:34.465 --> 42:37.593
Russian bombers are turning around
and returning to base.

42:41.439 --> 42:43.100
They're standing down.
