12:04.599 --> 12:09.629

12:13.358 --> 12:17.102
if you are squeamish,
cover your eyes!

12:17.404 --> 12:22.058
I and I alone, a mere mortal,

12:22.158 --> 12:25.819
will be the only thing

13:25.805 --> 13:28.041
Uh, so much to do. (LAUGHS)

13:28.141 --> 13:30.627
Just get me out of this contraption!

13:30.727 --> 13:32.587
That won't be a problem.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.756
As soon as I find the key.

13:34.856 --> 13:38.343
Are you kidding me, Uncle Larry?
I don't have time for this!

13:38.443 --> 13:40.678
Of course, time is money.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.889
Uh, whatever that means.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.016
So nice of you to visit.

13:45.116 --> 13:48.478

14:15.605 --> 14:16.923

14:17.023 --> 14:21.344
Uncle Lawrence, we need
to talk about this house.

14:21.444 --> 14:24.146
Oh. What exactly is
there to talk about?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.598
(GASPING)

14:25.698 --> 14:27.232
(SNEEZES)

14:28.535 --> 14:30.812

- A cat?

14:30.912 --> 14:33.189
No, I don't believe so.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.732
Uh, why do you ask?

14:34.832 --> 14:36.568
Look at me. (SNEEZING)

14:36.668 --> 14:38.695
Maybe you're allergic
to something else?

14:38.795 --> 14:41.913
Ooh, did I ask you if
you'd like some cookies?

14:42.215 --> 14:43.658
No cookies!

14:43.758 --> 14:47.961
If I stay in here any longer,
I'll blow up like a blimp! (SNEEZES)

14:48.763 --> 14:51.708
- Gesundheit!
- I'm allergic to two things.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.009
Wasting time... (SNEEZES)

14:54.644 --> 14:56.261
...and cats.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.715
You should think about
selling this place.

14:58.815 --> 15:02.260
I've got clients who would love to put
their hands on a property like this.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.678
They'd pay top dollar.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.305
Why would I do that?

15:05.405 --> 15:08.808
This house has been in the
family for generations.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.686
I know you're a great
real estate agent.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.488
If I sold it, where would I go?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.691
How about a nice retirement home?

15:16.791 --> 15:20.236
Retire? Uh, that's for old people.

15:20.336 --> 15:24.080
And besides, where would
I put all my belongings?

15:24.340 --> 15:27.501
DANIEL:
I would get rid of all this junk.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.789
Junk? (STAMMERS) This is not junk.
My whole life is in here.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.341
Whatever! Just... (SNEEZING)

15:39.897 --> 15:41.681
Pay your bills!

15:46.237 --> 15:50.774

What happened?

15:54.912 --> 15:57.815
Oh, don't you worry, everyone.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.151
I'm not going to sell my house.

16:00.251 --> 16:03.655
What would become of me
without all of you around?

16:03.755 --> 16:05.657
This house is enchanted.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.951
Isn't that right, Maggie?

16:08.051 --> 16:09.744
Come up here, Jack.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.412
Where's Edison?

16:11.512 --> 16:14.840
I need to put some oil on
his new rewind spring.

16:15.183 --> 16:16.925
(YAWNS) Oh, my... Oh.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.087
Or he'll stop working again. (LAUGHS)

16:19.187 --> 16:22.090
Wouldn't want any of you
getting yourself all rusty

16:22.190 --> 16:24.634
and not able to work any more.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.885
(SIGHS)

16:25.985 --> 16:27.936
That wouldn't do.

42:20.788 --> 42:23.698
Ah, I have one eensy-weesy problem.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.695
Problem? You need to have
full disclosure, I know my...

42:27.795 --> 42:30.073
No, no, no, you see,
the owner had a cat.

42:30.173 --> 42:33.667
And I'm super allergic to cats.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.044
I don't smell nothing.

42:36.304 --> 42:37.838
(SNEEZES)

42:38.306 --> 42:40.416
Take your time.
Have a good look around.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.843
I'll be right out here if
you have any questions.

42:43.645 --> 42:47.556
(GROANS) He must still have
that wretched cat in here!

42:48.858 --> 42:51.768
Oh, honey, that man
has a screw loose.

42:52.820 --> 42:55.890
This place is makin' my fur stand
on end. (BREATHING HEAVILY)

42:55.990 --> 42:58.358
I don't want to be fighting
no creepy critters.

42:58.743 --> 43:01.437
What is up with you today?
Now, you stay here.

43:01.537 --> 43:02.981
Momma's gonna be right back.

43:03.081 --> 43:06.199
Oh, well, I do like
this staircase, though.

43:06.709 --> 43:09.445
Okay, okay, no time to panic.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.205

- The cat.
- Hey, is that you, gato?

43:41.869 --> 43:46.740
Ooh, I knew this place was freaky!
They done turned you into a bird!

43:47.208 --> 43:49.242
Not really.
They locked me up in here.

43:49.544 --> 43:53.330
What's the matter? No more warm
and fuzzy part of the family for you?

43:53.548 --> 43:55.283
Well, it's complicated.

43:55.383 --> 43:57.619
I betcha there's one of them
dog cemeteries up in here

43:57.719 --> 44:00.038

44:00.138 --> 44:03.499
- Why my owner wants to buy it beats me.
- We've got to stop her.

That's what I'm saying, mi bro!

44:05.226 --> 44:06.336
You got to help me out of here.

Okay, okay, sure, uh,
how am I gonna do that?

44:09.397 --> 44:10.597
Oh...

Grab my tail.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.059

Are you sure?
What if I rip your tail off?

I doubt that. Come on, grab it!

45:43.157 --> 45:44.434
We got rid of her.

Oh, yes, of course, absolutely!
What about the cat?

45:49.497 --> 45:53.735
It appears fur ball took advantage
of your diversion to escape.

45:53.835 --> 45:57.405
Oh, never mind. We can do
without him. From now on,

45:57.505 --> 46:00.957

Come over here.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.446
How long have you had him?

46:38.546 --> 46:40.997
He just showed up at my
house a couple of days ago.

46:41.215 --> 46:42.700
I don't think he's a stray.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.085
Too clean, well-behaved.

46:45.219 --> 46:46.704
No nametag, though.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.122
Maybe he's lost.

46:48.222 --> 46:49.874
Abandoned, more likely.

46:49.974 --> 46:52.835
That's awful. Such a cute little cat.

- He's afraid of you.

at him for what happened.

No, it wasn't your fault.

Huh?

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.718
This house is history!

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.720
(GRUNTS)

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:14.890
Ah, come on!

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:17.386
(BOTH COOING)

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:19.187
(SIREN WAILING)

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:26.944
Excuse me, uh, but don't
you think you should...

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.441
Dylan? Izzy?

01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:31.276
We've got it under control,
Mr Lawrence.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:34.077
But you can't...
I mean, you're only...

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:37.872
We're almost there.
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:46.124
How does this stupid
contraption work?

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:47.591
Whoa!

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:54.883
- Wait, Jack, I'm not sure that's...
- We have no choice!

01:09:54.983 --> 01:09:56.600
I'm going for it.

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:00.013
Whoa.

01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:01.521
Oh, dear.

01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:05.435
Come on, you stupid gears.

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:07.353
Why couldn't they make
these things automatic?

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:10.440
(GRUNTING) Oh, no!

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.943
It appears I'm a bit too stout
in the girth to make it through.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:17.447
Oh, I knew it. Okay,
let me see what I can do.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:18.573
Suck it in, Jack.

01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:20.617
Oh! My leg!

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:22.167
Sorry, Jack.

01:10:24.304 --> 01:10:25.545
Oh!

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:32.135
Okay. Now we're talking.
I figured that out.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.347
No, no, no, no!

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.141
(SIGHS)

01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:42.229
(GROANS) Okay. One, two...

01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:45.357
Hold on, Jack, I'll get help.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.268
Maggie?

01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:51.154
Don't want to mess with the car.
No. No, no, no, no.

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.455
(PANTING)

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:02.833
I need your help. Jack is stuck.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.877
There's nothing you
can do for Thunder.

01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:09.214
Just standing there
won't bring him back.

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:17.090
Thunder.

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:18.890
You're... You're alive.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:24.646
Uh, what just happened?

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:26.857
Look, I'm really sorry for...

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.237
(GASPS)

01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:35.740
You saved me.

01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:37.826
Is everyone safe?

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.538
No, the trap door is blocked.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:48.753
Come with me and be careful.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.958
All right! I'm starting
to get the knack of this.

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:53.300
Huh?

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:59.716
Oh, no. Not that
old pain in the neck.

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:02.594
Daniel! What are you doing?

01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:04.387
What does it look like I'm doing?

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:08.099
Come down from there right
now before someone gets hurt.

01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:11.102
Just stay out of the way
and no one will get hurt.

01:12:11.202 --> 01:12:14.188
You can't destroy my house.
You have no right.

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:18.867
- Yes, I do. Remember this?
- What? You tricked me.

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:23.072
Daniel, please stop it.
You can't do that to them.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.540
I can and I want to.

01:12:26.384 --> 01:12:30.747
No, no, no! (GROANS)
What is up with these stupid birds?

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.290
- Look!
- It's Thunder.

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:34.083
He's helping the others get out.

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:37.837
(GROANS) It's you! I thought
I took care of you already!

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:40.924
Dylan, Izzy, we need to back off.

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:42.724
He's gone totally mad.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.765
Daniel, just stop it!

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.523
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

01:12:51.034 --> 01:12:52.651
Come on. Let's go.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:55.695
Thunder, wait.
We can't jump that far.

01:12:56.039 --> 01:12:58.073
Gunther, help them get across.

01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:04.162
Oh, but be careful!

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:10.877
The ball!

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:19.552
- I got him.
- Good catch, Dylan.

01:13:24.776 --> 01:13:26.017
Stay here.

01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:39.281
Is he crazy?

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.827
(WHIMPERS)

01:13:44.504 --> 01:13:46.746
Don't worry, I have a plan.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:51.042
- (SCREAMS)
- Thunder!

01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:54.004
I can't believe it!

01:13:55.056 --> 01:14:00.051
I'll show you who's in charge.
Take this, if you can.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:05.015
- Whoa!
- (CHUCKLING)

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:08.768
Mr Lawrence, can't you use
magic and make him stop?

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:11.014
My magic isn't strong
enough for this.

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:12.140
Whoa!

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.850
He's definitely going
to kill Thunder.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:15.442
Twiggoo, take me down.

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:19.480
- Maggie!
- Oh, no!

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.822
(SCREAMING)

01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:25.445
CARLO: Hang on, Maggie.

01:14:25.545 --> 01:14:26.696
(MAGGIE EXCLAIMS)

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.740
- CARLA: That's-a my big guy.

(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.173
Whoa!

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.347
A mouse! Get out of here!

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:29.099
(GRUNTING)

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.436
Whoa!

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.358
Ah, gotcha!

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:41.778
Huh?

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:47.742
All right, Thunder!

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:54.617
THUNDER: Whoa!

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:55.785
(THUD)

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:57.794
Huh? Where is he?

01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:02.625
(EXCLAIMS)

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:05.044

(SNEEZING)

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:32.488
Shame on you! Treating defenceless
little animals like that.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:35.415
Defenceless? Ah! Stop it!

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:40.044
I should let you sneeze to death for
the mess you've made of things.

01:16:40.221 --> 01:16:43.332
Please, Uncle Lawrence.
Please help me.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:47.461
I can't take it! I'm going
to pass out from all this.

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:48.803
(SNEEZING)

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.598
I suppose that wouldn't
be a good thing.

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:54.601
We wouldn't want anything
bad to happen to you.

01:16:54.819 --> 01:16:57.187
You've got a lot of
repair work to do.

01:16:57.822 --> 01:17:00.850
I think it best if we get him
over to the emergency room now.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.026
- We'll take him.
- No, no.

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:06.279
You two have done enough
driving for a while.

01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:08.107
Let's call 911.

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:10.074
(DANIEL CONTINUES SNEEZING)

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:14.662
Thunder?

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.073
Oh. Hi, Maggie.

01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:19.202
I just wanted to thank you
for saving me back there

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:23.379
and well, you know, apologise
for treating you the way I did.

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:26.508
I understand. You guys have
been together for a long time.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:29.511
No! We... I was wrong.

01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:33.264
But you made it right.
You helped me save the house.

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:35.600
We're a great team.

01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:38.686
Huh? Oh. You're right.

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:43.358
It looks like we still have
some unfinished business.

01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:45.485
Let's get them off the roof.

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:48.655
Aye, aye, Captain. (GIGGLES)

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:57.205
Hello? A bit of a hand over here
would be greatly appreciated.

01:17:58.966 --> 01:18:00.208
Anyone?

01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:04.664
Abracadabra!

01:18:04.764 --> 01:18:06.005
Presto!

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.292
- CHILDREN: Wow!
- (APPLAUSE)

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:10.294
It doesn't get any better than this.

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:12.053
Indeed, indeed.

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:13.839
It's great to have Lawrence back.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:16.050
Whoo-hoo! Hey, gato!

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:20.478
Word on the street is that you guys
put on one crazy good show!

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:23.182
Hey, I thought this
place freaked you out.

01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:27.270
Ghosts, big-toothed were-rabbit
and an evil mouse, remember?

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:31.482
Well, I suppose I do get a
bit carried away sometimes,

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:33.825
especially when I'm excited.
(CHUCKLES)

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:38.072
(CLEARS THROAT) Anyway,
you wouldn't by any chance have room

01:18:38.172 --> 01:18:42.827
for someone else, namely me,
in your little act, would you?

01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:44.245
You're a trained actor?

01:18:44.345 --> 01:18:48.214
Am I an actor? I'm the
Marlon Brando of chihuahuas!

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:52.128
I can roll over, play dead,
look cool, but I don't fetch.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:53.254
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:55.715
I ain't no retriever.
So what do ya say?

01:18:55.815 --> 01:18:58.175
I can fit in, do what you want.
I can play whatever you need,

01:18:58.275 --> 01:18:59.427
I'm the man.

01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:02.895
- (CHILDREN CHEERING)
- Hey, guys! We're on next! Come on!

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.735
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on, man.

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:12.697
So, then, I take that as a yes?

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:15.700
(ALL CHEERING)

01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:26.002
CHILDREN: Wow!

01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:31.841
Let's give a big round of applause
to Jack, Maggie and Thunder!

01:19:57.751 --> 01:19:59.494
(DOORBELL CHIMES)

01:20:02.882 --> 01:20:04.540
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:08.621
Oh! You must be the
real estate agent.

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:12.124
Sorry I'm a bit late.
Quite the quaint abode you have.

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:17.011
Yes, but now that I'm alone,
this place is just too big for me.

01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:20.139
I'm going to a nice retirement home.

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:25.561
So, how much cash you think
I could get for the place?

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:29.982
Let's have a look inside and
I'll give you my best estimate.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:34.320
(CATS MEOWING)

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:38.442
DANIEL: Oh, no.

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:44.122
(SNEEZING) That's it. I need
to find another line of work!
