beat this.

be dangerous without even knowing,

06:02.687 --> 06:04.927
I've designed a new bio-scan.

06:04.927 --> 06:07.047

Very neat.

sure the existing

this scan goes live.

No disrespect, but couldn't any
computer-literate techie do that?

06:23.807 --> 06:26.607
I built this system on top of yours
from the old ARC,

running after an overgrown lizard,

She died because of you and your
rules.

gateway, no matter what the risk.
We shouldn't have left it so long.

your phone? I was busy.

42:34.304 --> 42:37.104
Wasn't there something that you
wanted to tell me?

42:37.784 --> 42:39.744
About New Dawn?

42:40.544 --> 42:42.504
Oh...

42:42.984 --> 42:44.944
Another time.

43:18.184 --> 43:20.144
You live alone.

43:22.624 --> 43:24.664
I can tell.

43:24.664 --> 43:26.624
Lacks a woman's touch.

43:30.264 --> 43:32.224
No man servant?

43:32.464 --> 43:34.424
Not even a parlour maid.

43:35.384 --> 43:37.344
You mocking me?

43:38.744 --> 43:40.984
Times have changed since you were
around.

43:41.624 --> 43:43.584
First time you were around.

44:00.584 --> 44:02.864
It's incredible.
It's not bad.

44:06.264 --> 44:08.304
I'm sorry I hit you.

44:08.304 --> 44:10.264
But you shouldn't have followed me.

44:10.504 --> 44:12.544
I was just trying to help you.

44:12.544 --> 44:14.504
I was just trying to help you.

44:14.904 --> 44:16.864
I was afraid you'd end up like us.

44:17.424 --> 44:19.464
Lost...

44:19.464 --> 44:21.224
Trapped...

44:21.704 --> 44:23.664
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

44:36.984 --> 44:40.904
The people I travelled with were all
damaged in their own way,

44:40.904 --> 44:42.864
being so far from home.

44:44.184 --> 44:47.424
But Ethan is something else.
(MECHANICAL LIFT DOOR OPENS)

44:47.424 --> 44:49.304
He's different.

44:49.304 --> 44:50.904
Hello.
Who are you?

44:50.904 --> 44:52.864
Pity.

44:54.304 --> 44:57.224
It's as if there's something broken
in him.

45:03.424 --> 45:06.544
Charlotte kept him under control and
now that she's dead

45:06.544 --> 45:08.504
none of us are safe.

45:09.864 --> 45:13.384
Emily, whatever happens I want you to
know that you're safe here.

45:16.624 --> 45:18.584
I promise you that.

45:21.824 --> 45:24.144
None of us are safe while Ethan's
out there.

45:32.504 --> 45:35.984
I have to find Ethan.
When I get back we can find Ethan
together, I promise.

45:36.784 --> 45:40.464
These creatures present an ongoing
and potentially uncontrollable
threat.

45:40.464 --> 45:43.104
I think you seriously have to
consider putting them down.

45:43.104 --> 45:45.144
He wants to kill Rex.

45:45.144 --> 45:47.184
Just order him to clear out the
loading bay

45:47.184 --> 45:50.504
while I get the creatures out.
What are you going to do with
the mammoth?

45:50.504 --> 45:54.184
Matt, anomaly alert, JP School,
Thornton Street, the others are on
their way.

45:54.184 --> 45:57.424
Connor, be careful, it uses a toxic
venom to paralyse its prey.

45:57.424 --> 46:01.424
Matt, there's two kids! And they're
heading straight for the creature.

46:01.424 --> 46:03.704
There's another kid. A girl.

46:03.704 --> 46:07.544
Connor, we've lost Becker, Matt's
outnumbered, we have to do something
now!

46:07.544 --> 46:09.904
There's too many. There's too many!

46:09.904 --> 46:11.584
Becker.
