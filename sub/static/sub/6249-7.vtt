00:05.580 --> 00:08.580
Our time capsule 
was buried in 1987.

00:08.600 --> 00:11.760
The year the DOW closed
above 2000 for the first time.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.740
Reagan told Gorbachev to
tear down the Berlin Wall.

00:14.750 --> 00:18.210
You had a huge crush 
on LaToya Jackson.

00:18.260 --> 00:19.100
I did.

00:19.130 --> 00:20.910
You can't complain,Stinson.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.380
You married the 
head cheerleader.

00:22.410 --> 00:23.620
Lucky I did.

00:23.910 --> 00:26.890
And now we have a wonderful kid
who's a senior,right here at Foothill.

00:26.930 --> 00:28.690
Alex,take a bow.

00:29.850 --> 00:35.850
Anyhow,we're here today to open the
time capsule that we buried 20 years ago,

00:35.870 --> 00:39.810
so we can see who we were and how the
heck we all got to where we are today.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.140
Found it!

00:44.010 --> 00:45.190
Twenty years...

00:45.200 --> 00:46.540
Do you even remember
what you put in there?

00:46.560 --> 00:49.360
No. A bad perm and pink
leg warmers,probably.

00:50.770 --> 00:52.370
Here we go!

00:57.340 --> 00:58.740
God! That is vile!

00:58.770 --> 00:59.830
Oh,what the hell,Bill?

00:59.850 --> 01:01.350
I thought you said the
thing was watertight?

01:01.370 --> 01:04.060
It should've been,and it's Gil,not Bill.

01:04.450 --> 01:06.110
Let's see what we've got here.

01:13.890 --> 01:15.340
What is it?!

01:18.440 --> 01:20.170
Now this is a sweet field.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.000
This is what I'm talking about. Right?

01:22.020 --> 01:23.450
I mean,it's nothing like ours,

01:23.470 --> 01:26.520
but,hey,that didn't stop me
from being MVP my senior year.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.030
Got the trophy,touchdown!

01:28.070 --> 01:32.520
In certain tribes,in the African
subcontinent,piercings serve as a reminder,

01:32.530 --> 01:36.900
like your trophy,of the power and
agility,which has since faded away.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.360
What do you mean,fade away?

01:38.370 --> 01:39.010
Time out.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.350
Can we just concentrate on the case?

01:40.370 --> 01:41.090
What do we got here?

01:41.130 --> 01:42.540
We were all gathered for the opening.

01:42.560 --> 01:46.810
We had no idea that
that thing was in there.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.340
That is rank.

01:49.370 --> 01:52.410
I was just expecting to
see my 10,000 Maniacs album.

01:52.430 --> 01:53.940
That was not there.

01:53.970 --> 01:54.580
Who are you?

01:54.610 --> 01:55.770
I'm Gil Bates.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.900
I sealed it myself.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.490
I used a propylene seal
and industrial bolt lags.

01:59.500 --> 02:03.880
Adolescent,Caucasian
male,late teens,early 20s.

02:03.910 --> 02:08.039
All right,so,what do you say we just pack it
all up and ship it back to the Jeffersonian?

02:08.060 --> 02:09.979
Oh,I'm sorry. That's not a good idea.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.810
You see,the water has compromised the
structural integrity of the case,so...

02:13.820 --> 02:15.220
Well,will you look at this,Bones.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.280
Another nerd for your squint squad.

02:17.310 --> 02:18.270
- Drill.
- Drill.

02:18.290 --> 02:20.520
Drill? Whoa,wait a second. You're
going to drill it right here?

02:20.540 --> 02:22.470
What about taking it
all back to Jeffersonian?

02:22.500 --> 02:23.470
Tub.

02:48.550 --> 02:52.730
A 1987 Foothill High
School yearbook,of course.

02:53.930 --> 02:56.450
How about th-the ghetto blaster?

02:58.230 --> 02:59.890
Rubik's Cube?

03:00.820 --> 03:01.850
How about this?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.480
CD,no needle required.

03:03.500 --> 03:07.590
In 20 years,they'll be able to put
hundreds of those on a microchip.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.310
Victim had several ante-mortem
fractures to his sternum,

03:10.340 --> 03:14.460
as well as several antemortem fractures
to the lateral sections of his ribs.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.620
All healed?

03:15.630 --> 03:17.830
All healed at different times.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.840
I had a Michael Jackson glove.

03:19.870 --> 03:21.280
I've never mentioned that before.

03:21.310 --> 03:23.010
I loved Chevy Chase.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.350
We all have our crosses to bear.

03:24.380 --> 03:27.870
The fracture on the
right clavicle is fresh.

03:27.910 --> 03:30.080
Well,was,20 years ago.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.610
Oh! Mullet alert!

03:32.650 --> 03:34.760
Ooh,that's a nasty one.

03:34.780 --> 03:37.660
Booth got a list of all the students who
didn't make it to the capsule opening,

03:37.680 --> 03:42.430
and he's pulling the names of anyone connected
to the school in 1987 who had a record.

03:42.470 --> 03:47.620
Oh,my God,I'm getting flashbacks
to braces and stirrup pants

03:47.630 --> 03:50.380
and a really,really bad side ponytail.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.500
You certainly grew out of it.

03:51.530 --> 03:54.120
I wore Doc Marten's that
weighed more than I did.

03:54.130 --> 03:55.780
Apparently Booth was fine.

03:55.820 --> 03:56.980
He was a football player.

03:56.990 --> 03:59.840
Right. He was one ofthoseguys.

03:59.870 --> 04:03.130
Well,this guy certainly wasn't
hanging out with the cheerleaders,

04:03.160 --> 04:07.820
but I bet he had some love notes
stashed away in hisSpaceballs binder.

04:07.870 --> 04:09.570
I think I saw him in the video.

04:09.590 --> 04:11.140
Roger Dillon.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.380
Class of 1987.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.220
Here he is.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.050
The comet will be around in 76 years.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.880
We'll still be around,don't worry.

04:20.950 --> 04:25.160
How did Roger Dillon get fromthere...

04:26.500 --> 04:28.440
to here?

05:08.580 --> 05:10.350
I ran a sample of the sludge.

05:10.390 --> 05:11.490
Organic matter.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.950
Or you could call him "Roger."

05:12.990 --> 05:14.960
Oh,come on,when 
you can ladle someone,

05:14.990 --> 05:17.100
he's a little less than
a person,don't you think?

05:17.170 --> 05:17.680
Fine.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.350
I took a sample of Roger,ran it
through the mass spectrometer.

05:21.390 --> 05:22.500
You'll never guess what I found.

05:22.510 --> 05:24.880
Traces of an unidentified
organophosphate.

05:24.890 --> 05:26.230
- Nerve gas?
- Very good.

05:26.260 --> 05:27.670
I'll break down the rest chemicals now.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.920
The victim also had a
peri-mortem fracture in his wrist.

05:30.960 --> 05:34.900
There are indications of a grade-two
acromioclavicular joint separation.

05:34.930 --> 05:36.590
But it was certainly not lethal.

05:36.630 --> 05:37.410
I've seen it before.

05:37.430 --> 05:40.770
Someone twisted the victim's
arm behind his back,forcefully.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.410
So,what,he got beat
up for his lunch money?

05:42.440 --> 05:45.230
Violent students are the
hallmark of a schoolyard.

05:45.260 --> 05:47.810
I speak from experience.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.250
However,these fractures on his
ribs might predate high school.

05:52.260 --> 05:55.950
So...he might've had
some trouble at home.

06:01.970 --> 06:05.740
I don't understand,Mr. Dillon,why
you never reported your son missing.

06:05.790 --> 06:08.750
His mother told me 
that Roger ran away.

06:08.780 --> 06:11.940
You weren't concerned that your
son never contacted you again?

06:11.960 --> 06:13.360
He didn't live with
me,he didn't want to.

06:13.390 --> 06:15.820
Because of the physical abuse?

06:16.110 --> 06:19.140
Yeah,I was a drinker in those days.

06:19.160 --> 06:22.310
And I understood why he
wanted to just write me off.

06:22.330 --> 06:23.340
But I cared about him.

06:23.370 --> 06:24.360
I was sick.

06:24.390 --> 06:26.330
When was the last 
time you saw Roger?

06:26.350 --> 06:29.240
It was night of his
high school graduation.

06:29.270 --> 06:32.930
He came over here,afterwards,
asking me for money,a lot.

06:32.940 --> 06:35.620
You threw him out of the house with
his arm twisted behind his back.

06:35.650 --> 06:36.850
I swear,he...

06:36.860 --> 06:38.990
he got up and he walked away.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.320
Now this was 20 years ago.

06:41.330 --> 06:43.140
What's this all about?

06:43.180 --> 06:45.280
Roger is dead,Mr. Dillon.

06:45.300 --> 06:49.280
His remains were found yesterday.

06:50.170 --> 06:52.470
Oh...God...

06:52.510 --> 06:53.910
Found him at the high school.

06:53.950 --> 06:57.420
He had been in a time
capsule for 20 years.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.340
Any idea why he 
needed the money?

07:02.010 --> 07:02.990
Wouldn't say.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.430
Guess it was so 
he could run away.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.310
You should talk to Gil.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.310
He was Roger's best friend.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.190
Gil Bates?

07:11.220 --> 07:12.270
Yeah.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.360
That's the Tech Town guy?

07:13.400 --> 07:16.320
Yeah. They did everything together.

07:16.410 --> 07:18.050
We'll be in touch.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.090
I'm different now.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.090
I'm sober.

07:24.130 --> 07:26.850
I never... I never wanted to hurt him.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.930
I loved Roger.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.590
Right.

07:37.220 --> 07:40.140
The kid basically
melted into all of this.

07:40.170 --> 07:43.200
I should be able to pull more
chemical traces off the artifacts

07:43.240 --> 07:45.100
to I.D. the organophosphate on him.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.530
- Beta--  -
St.Elmo's Fire.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.360
It's on the list.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.000
One yearbook.

07:51.010 --> 07:52.970
Foothill High School,1987.

07:53.000 --> 07:53.580
Check.

07:53.610 --> 07:54.820
Dehydrate and scan.

07:54.860 --> 07:55.940
"Have a great summer."

07:55.950 --> 07:57.300
"Don't ever change."

07:57.320 --> 07:58.210
Remember those days?

07:58.240 --> 08:00.050
I remember getting
grounded every weekend.

08:00.070 --> 08:02.280
So many rules to break,
so little time...

08:02.310 --> 08:03.570
You were the nerd fantasy.

08:03.590 --> 08:04.820
I was all about Barbie.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.370
She was my first anatomy lesson.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.250
I was confused for years.

08:08.290 --> 08:09.190
What about Ken?

08:09.220 --> 08:10.760
I felt so sorry for him.

08:10.780 --> 08:13.330
Floppy disk the size of a dinner plate.

08:13.350 --> 08:14.180
Bingo,baby.

08:14.210 --> 08:16.010
The disk is not on the list.

08:16.030 --> 08:17.670
Wow,what are you?

08:17.700 --> 08:18.590
A term paper?

08:18.630 --> 08:19.830
Launch codes?

08:19.860 --> 08:20.640
We need to pull the data.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.470
Do you think you're up to it?

08:22.520 --> 08:23.990
I can try.

08:24.380 --> 08:25.590
A hockey skate.

08:25.650 --> 08:27.780
And it looks like it's signed.

08:27.810 --> 08:28.640
Check on the skate.

08:28.670 --> 08:31.520
It belonged to some
jock named John Adamson.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.150
A can of New Coke.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.980
Definitely an '80's plot
to destabilize the country.

08:36.010 --> 08:37.130
Another check.

08:37.169 --> 08:38.400
And a pocket watch.

08:38.429 --> 08:40.780
The watch is not on the list.

08:43.870 --> 08:45.090
It's a Wallingham.

08:45.120 --> 08:45.970
It's nice.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.110
A computer disk and a pocket watch?

08:49.140 --> 08:50.630
What was our little geek into?

08:50.650 --> 08:52.310
It's dry.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.410
This is a good watch.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.040
Some kind of residue.

08:56.090 --> 08:57.780
Could it help I.D. the poison?

08:57.800 --> 08:59.150
Let me at it.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.740
Roger's father had no
trouble getting physical.

09:05.760 --> 09:09.250
So why would he resort to poisoning
his son with a nerve agent?

09:09.260 --> 09:10.840
What sort of teenager were you,Bones?

09:10.870 --> 09:13.310
He did have a series of odd jobs.

09:13.330 --> 09:15.620
Perhaps he procured the
poison from one of them.

09:15.640 --> 09:20.010
Come on,you have to have at least one
good story before you pasted on a lab coat.

09:20.020 --> 09:21.470
I was busy,studying.

09:21.490 --> 09:25.110
And in all those hours of studying,you
never came across one hormone?

09:25.130 --> 09:28.110
Fine,there was one boy.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.910
Andy Pfleuger.

09:31.970 --> 09:34.690
He was the varsity lacrosse captain.

09:34.710 --> 09:38.800
Did you kiss the
varsity lacrosse captain?

09:38.830 --> 09:41.070
I was weighing the pros and cons...

09:41.130 --> 09:43.470
when he became my Secret Santa.

09:43.490 --> 09:44.870
I thought you hated Secret Santa.

09:44.900 --> 09:48.080
Yes,because he taped
the gift to my locker.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.850
Everyone saw it.

09:50.370 --> 09:51.930
Teenagers can be cruel.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.240
What was it?

09:53.280 --> 09:54.260
It doesn't matter.

09:54.310 --> 09:55.970
Come on,Bones.

09:55.980 --> 09:57.300
You promise not to laugh?

09:57.320 --> 09:59.190
Listen,I'm your partner.

09:59.740 --> 10:01.470
It was a Brainy Smurf.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.560
You said you wouldn't laugh.

10:03.570 --> 10:04.860
I'm not laughing.

10:04.880 --> 10:05.850
Brainy Smurf,huh?

10:05.880 --> 10:06.950
Well,it was deliberate.

10:06.980 --> 10:09.650
He knew I wanted Smurfette.

10:10.270 --> 10:11.870
Okay,it's clear you find this amusing.

10:11.890 --> 10:13.630
I'm not laughing.

10:13.650 --> 10:15.410
I'm not.

10:16.270 --> 10:17.500
What?

10:18.230 --> 10:21.320
You know,Angel was right--
you were one ofthoseguys.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.260
What?

10:22.870 --> 10:24.680
One of what guys?

10:26.080 --> 10:28.560
That was Roger in the time capsule?

10:29.580 --> 10:31.100
I saw his skull.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.130
Oh,my God,I saw his skull.

10:33.410 --> 10:35.940
He's been there since 1987.

10:35.950 --> 10:37.730
No,Roger took off. He left a note.

10:37.760 --> 10:38.860
A note?

10:38.880 --> 10:40.310
Graduation night,he left his mom a note,

10:40.350 --> 10:42.450
saying that he hated it
here and he was running away.

10:42.470 --> 10:44.550
Yeah,and he went to his
father's house to ask for money.

10:44.580 --> 10:45.500
Do you know why?

10:45.530 --> 10:48.140
All I knew was what his mom said
was in the note he left,so...

10:48.180 --> 10:51.040
Gil,his mother was dead,and
his father never saw it,so...

10:51.080 --> 10:54.860
So,you're the only connection
we have to the note.

10:55.830 --> 11:02.550
It said,uh,you know that he
couldn't be around his dad anymore.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.420
Or the kids at school.

11:04.520 --> 11:05.890
They picked on him.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.630
They used to pick on me,too.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.960
I guess,he just couldn't take it.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.250
Why wouldn't he have
just asked for help?

11:16.990 --> 11:19.010
He was my best friend.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.320
I always thought that I'd see him again.

11:25.390 --> 11:27.520
I can't believe I'll
never see him again.

11:35.690 --> 11:40.220
All right,I found several denim cotton
fibers on both the gold watch and the floppy,

11:40.240 --> 11:44.610
matching what's left of the victim's
classic acid wash '80s jeans.

11:44.630 --> 11:48.340
That places the watch and the disk inside
the victim's pocket at the time of his murder.

11:48.370 --> 11:50.770
I tested the residue
inside the watch casing.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.160
Pure crystalline tropane alkaloid.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.470
Roger Dillon had a pocket
watch full of cocaine?

11:55.520 --> 11:58.690
It's soMiami Vice,I
could roll up my sleeves.

11:58.710 --> 12:04.020
The FBI sent us the files of everyone
connected to the school who had a record.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.230
Mostly petty theft,D.U.I.s,that
sort of thing.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.460
Darwin Banks.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.400
Teacher at Foothill High.

12:11.430 --> 12:15.750
Arrested in a schoolwide
drug bust,June 12,1987.

12:15.770 --> 12:18.190
That's two days after Roger disappeared.

12:18.230 --> 12:19.660
And Roger need money.

12:19.690 --> 12:23.480
Looks like our young geek might've
been killed over a drug deal.

12:34.970 --> 12:36.870
Do you rember Roger Dillon?

12:36.900 --> 12:38.510
Foothill High,right?

12:39.140 --> 12:40.810
I was his science teacher.

12:40.860 --> 12:41.950
Smart kid.

12:41.980 --> 12:42.880
He could've taught the class.

12:42.910 --> 12:44.460
Now he's dead.

12:44.910 --> 12:48.120
We found him stuffed into
Foothill's time capsule.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.630
Been there since 1987.

12:50.690 --> 12:51.530
God...

12:51.580 --> 12:57.690
And it says here in the yearbook that you were
the faculty advisor to the time capsule committee.

12:57.740 --> 12:58.940
You gotta be kidding.

12:58.970 --> 13:03.110
I usually don't joke around when
a 17- year-old boy's been murdered.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.420
Found evidence of cocaine on him.

13:06.440 --> 13:07.690
Roger? No.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.130
That kid was clean.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.980
The only way he got high was sitting
in front of his computer writing code.

13:13.030 --> 13:17.430
Right,so help me out here,because in '87 you
were arrested at the high school for dealing.

13:17.460 --> 13:18.390
I wasn't dealing.

13:18.410 --> 13:19.680
I was just out of college.

13:19.690 --> 13:20.970
I had two joints on me.

13:21.010 --> 13:22.800
And four ounces in your apartment.

13:22.830 --> 13:24.220
I was 23.

13:24.230 --> 13:26.790
We all do crazy stuff when we're kids.

13:26.820 --> 13:28.310
Exactly.

13:29.700 --> 13:32.550
I have my own business
now,a wife and two kids.

13:32.580 --> 13:35.150
I'm in the Rotary Club for God's sake.

13:35.180 --> 13:36.770
Well,we know that Roger needed money.

13:36.790 --> 13:40.750
Maybe he started dealing for
you,and he wanted a bigger payout,

13:40.770 --> 13:42.460
threatened to turn you
in if he didn't get it,

13:42.480 --> 13:45.000
so you killed him?

13:45.030 --> 13:47.400
I didn't kill him and
Roger didn't rat me out.

13:47.430 --> 13:53.230
It was Adamson,John Adamson,an
entitled ass even at 17.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.890
I caught him cheating
and the next thing I know,

13:55.910 --> 13:58.910
the cops are knocking
on my classroom door.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.720
He just wanted to discredit
me,so he could retake the test.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.920
Right. So you're the victim
with four ounces of weed?

14:06.260 --> 14:10.470
Can you confirm your
whereabouts on June 14,1987?

14:10.520 --> 14:15.750
If I'm such a big drug-dealing
liar,why would I tell you the truth?

14:15.780 --> 14:19.550
Because you don't want to go to
jail for killing Roger Dillon.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.460
Come on,Sweets,just come on,you've
done a lot of psychological profiling.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.550
The case is 20 years
old,we just need some help.

14:28.580 --> 14:30.840
That's not why we're
here today,Agent Booth.

14:30.860 --> 14:32.870
This hour is for you and Dr. Brennan.

14:32.890 --> 14:35.280
Oh,she's not gonna mind; it's
only gonna take five minutes,okay?

14:35.310 --> 14:36.510
1987.

14:36.530 --> 14:40.700
Suburban kid is killed and
stuffed into a time capsule.

14:40.730 --> 14:42.230
Fascinating,right?

14:42.260 --> 14:45.410
What kind of person would do that?

14:45.930 --> 14:49.750
So have any conflicts or issues
arisen since our last session?

14:49.780 --> 14:52.900
Well... Bones and I
are doing just great.

14:52.910 --> 14:55.330
You look angry,Dr. Brennan.

14:57.130 --> 15:03.260
I told Agent Booth a private story
about my childhood and he laughed.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.100
What?

15:05.150 --> 15:08.840
No,I... I was appreciating it.

15:08.870 --> 15:10.990
Don't get him involved.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.890
Snorting does not suggest appreciation.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.250
It was about a cartoon
character from the... 1980s.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.670
I didn't think you'd be so sensitive.

15:18.700 --> 15:22.220
Well,childhood icons have great
significance to us,Agent Booth,all right?

15:22.250 --> 15:25.900
I myself was very attached toVoltron.

15:27.870 --> 15:29.550
Cartoon.

15:29.570 --> 15:30.750
Voltron.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.740
You're hurt,Dr. Brennan,

15:32.780 --> 15:36.850
because you feel you opened yourself up
to Agent Booth and he betrayed that trust.

15:36.880 --> 15:37.860
We're talking about a Smurf.

15:37.890 --> 15:38.740
Smurfette.

15:38.770 --> 15:41.850
Perhaps a way to bring this
relationship back into symmetry

15:41.860 --> 15:44.340
is if you reveal a childhood
story about yourself.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.550
Show your vulnerability to Dr. Brennan.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.030
No,you know what? This is crazy.

15:48.070 --> 15:49.390
It's... it's not right.

15:49.410 --> 15:51.390
- Tell him that it's not right.
- Is it?

15:51.420 --> 15:52.650
Oh,you're on his side.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.220
Why don't you go playVoltron with him.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.230
You were that guy,weren't
you,Agent Booth?

15:56.270 --> 15:59.510
You were the golden boy who could get away
with anything just by turning on the charm.

15:59.530 --> 16:01.500
That's ridiculous. You
don't even know who I am.

16:01.520 --> 16:05.500
Could it be that you're still
holding on to that persona,

16:05.530 --> 16:07.210
that you're afraid to reveal yourself?

16:07.240 --> 16:08.080
I'm an FBI agent.

16:08.110 --> 16:09.810
I get shot at everyday,all right?

16:09.850 --> 16:10.790
I'm not afraid of anything.

16:10.810 --> 16:13.300
Okay,this is obviously
very difficult for you.

16:13.330 --> 16:17.400
But you shouldn't be
ashamed to ask for help.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.080
You shouldn't.

16:24.410 --> 16:25.650
Okay.

16:28.190 --> 16:29.690
Okay.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.730
I apologize. I do need help.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.930
With this case.

16:36.960 --> 16:42.470
So,while you review this,I
will reveal myself to Bones.

16:44.260 --> 16:46.380
I know that sounded weird,but
you know what I mean.

16:46.420 --> 16:52.750
So you will share an emotionally
humiliating episode from your youth with me?

16:52.780 --> 16:54.420
Yeah. I-I have them.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.910
Here.

16:56.070 --> 16:57.620
All right. Excellent.

16:57.640 --> 17:01.960
Now,for the remainder of
our time,let's role play.

17:04.740 --> 17:08.819
Now I know why I'm not allowed
to bring my gun in here.

17:13.730 --> 17:18.109
I tested the goop,found traces of cocaine
consistent with the leakage from the gold watch.

17:18.119 --> 17:21.819
But when I checked the results against samples
of his hair and bones,it came out negative;

17:21.839 --> 17:22.910
Roger didn't do drugs.

17:22.930 --> 17:25.440
- So his old teacher was telling the truth?
- Yup.

17:26.740 --> 17:29.510
I also discovered what he
was dosed with and how much.

17:29.530 --> 17:30.180
What?

17:30.210 --> 17:31.560
Malaoxon.

17:31.580 --> 17:32.630
Malaoxon?

17:32.660 --> 17:33.470
Yeah.

17:33.490 --> 17:35.500
Is neurotoxic in high doses.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.950
Yeah,but there was barely
enough to make a mouse cough.

17:37.980 --> 17:40.690
So our theory about poisoning
is incorrect as well.

17:40.730 --> 17:44.740
Dr. Saroyan,I found an
anomaly on the victim's skull.

17:44.780 --> 17:45.990
When I was cleaning the skull,

17:46.010 --> 17:49.820
I found a tiny irregularity on the
undersurface of the victim's mandible.

17:49.830 --> 17:53.680
Magnified,it proved to be a
tiny,but sharply defined fracture.

17:53.700 --> 17:57.390
Judging by its location,it appears
that a weapon was thrust into the neck,

17:57.400 --> 17:59.290
cutting through the
sterno cleidomastoid,

17:59.310 --> 18:01.800
and severing both the carotid
artery and jugular vein.

18:01.820 --> 18:04.430
Which means Roger must have bled out.

18:04.450 --> 18:05.660
Have you determined a weapon?

18:05.690 --> 18:08.120
Judging by the microscopic
crushing of the bone,

18:08.150 --> 18:10.590
the weapon was neither
too sharp nor too blunt.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.260
It certainly wasn't an edged weapon.

18:12.290 --> 18:13.880
- So it wasn't a knife?
- Correct.

18:13.910 --> 18:17.650
However,it left an odd
textural stain in the crevice.

18:17.660 --> 18:22.060
I've taken a sample and will hand
it over to Hodgins for testing.

18:25.700 --> 18:28.620
This little darling
is a Commodore Amiga,

18:28.630 --> 18:33.150
with a Motorola 6800 chip set
using a homemade operating system.

18:33.170 --> 18:35.610
I got it from the computer
exhibit on the third floor.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.280
I used to have this exact computer.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.390
My geek princess.

18:40.610 --> 18:43.340
I knew the mall couldn't
suck out your soul.

18:46.090 --> 18:47.820
Hey,look at that.

18:51.620 --> 18:54.020
Oh,this is incredible!

18:54.040 --> 18:56.080
This is like a primitive Doom.

18:56.110 --> 18:58.520
You don't see anything wrong with that?

18:58.560 --> 19:00.200
Doom came out in 1993.

19:00.230 --> 19:03.660
All of this stuff-- the 3-D
rendering,the first person shooting¡ª

19:03.700 --> 19:06.740
was barely a glint in
a geek's eye in 1987!

19:06.780 --> 19:08.980
So Roger was way ahead of his time.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.010
If this game had come out in 1987,

19:11.030 --> 19:14.850
Roger Dillon would have been a
billionaire several times over.

19:14.870 --> 19:18.330
Money is always a
good motive for murder.

19:21.790 --> 19:26.440
I'm pretty sure that Sweets would say a lost
baseball game is not personal or revealing.

19:26.450 --> 19:27.830
Football,Bones,okay.

19:27.850 --> 19:28.630
It's football.

19:28.640 --> 19:29.750
Oh,okay,I got one.

19:29.780 --> 19:32.610
All right,personally between two
people or revealing,like,uh...

19:33.170 --> 19:34.110
Naked?

19:34.130 --> 19:35.080
That's very literal.

19:35.110 --> 19:39.340
There was this girl,Karen Isley,and
we were under the bleachers one night.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.750
Personally. You with me?

19:41.770 --> 19:45.290
Got it. You were having sex in
the dirt under the bleachers.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.300
Excuse me,I'm a gentleman.
I brought my sleeping bag.

19:47.310 --> 19:49.400
- Did you fail to perform sexually?
- What?

19:49.420 --> 19:52.550
'Cause that might actually
count as a humiliation.

19:52.830 --> 19:56.810
Will you just wait? Will you
just allow me to tell my story?

19:56.850 --> 19:57.570
Fine.

19:57.580 --> 19:58.450
Thank you.

19:58.480 --> 20:01.950
All right,so this girl,she had this
game where she would ask me a question...

20:01.970 --> 20:02.670
What kind of a question?

20:02.680 --> 20:03.790
It doesn't matter,okay?

20:03.800 --> 20:06.910
So,if I got the question
wrong,I'd have to...

20:06.940 --> 20:08.640
take off a piece of my clothing.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.740
Of course I knew all the answers,but
I pretended that I didn't.

20:11.770 --> 20:12.730
So you could take off your clothes?

20:12.750 --> 20:13.620
Exactly.

20:13.650 --> 20:19.340
No,the point is,I'm standing there,you
know,in my socks,and my St.Christopher medal...

20:19.390 --> 20:20.880
she runs off.

20:20.930 --> 20:24.280
She runs off with the sleeping
bag and all of my clothes.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.280
And I'm standing there stark-o.

20:26.310 --> 20:27.390
Why'd she do that?

20:27.420 --> 20:31.750
Well,I suppose she heard I was under the
bleachers with another girl the week before.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.920
Okay,this is a story
about sexual prowess,Booth.

20:33.950 --> 20:34.680
You're bragging.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.340
I had to run across
the campus buck naked.

20:37.380 --> 20:39.320
You're laughing about it now.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.690
You enjoyed displaying your penis.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.330
It showed alpha male mastery.

20:42.360 --> 20:47.250
Only one other person knew
about Brainy Smurf,was my mother.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.790
Cold,okay,it was cold.

20:48.830 --> 20:52.030
Do you know what happens
to a guy when it is cold...

20:53.030 --> 20:53.890
outside?

20:53.910 --> 20:54.750
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:54.770 --> 20:55.410
Can we make this quick?

20:55.440 --> 20:57.480
My boss doesn't understand
why I keep leaving.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.290
And he's kind of a jerk,so.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.750
What do you know about,uh...

21:00.770 --> 21:02.410
"WarStrike"?

21:03.330 --> 21:04.970
I,I haven't heard that
name in a long time.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.220
We found it on a disk
in the time capsule.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.120
It was on Roger when he was killed.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.560
Oh,my God.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.490
So you knew about it?

21:12.510 --> 21:14.890
Yeah,but only as a
drawing in his notebook.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.600
I
- I didn't know he'd written the code.

21:16.620 --> 21:18.840
Yeah,well,according to an
expert at the Jeffersonian,

21:18.870 --> 21:20.260
someone could make a
lot of money off of it.

21:20.280 --> 21:20.930
We planned to.

21:20.950 --> 21:23.490
We were gonna start a gaming
business after graduation.

21:23.510 --> 21:26.280
Roger was the brain,and
I was the business guy.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.390
Wait... you saw the game?

21:28.410 --> 21:29.240
It worked?

21:29.270 --> 21:31.080
If you were partners,why
wouldn't he tell you that?

21:31.100 --> 21:32.180
He was a perfectionist.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.310
He would never show me anything
unless he thought it was perfect.

21:34.330 --> 21:36.680
Yeah,well,maybe he was trying
to make a deal with someone else.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.590
No. No way.

21:38.620 --> 21:39.700
We were partners,okay.

21:39.740 --> 21:41.060
Best friends our whole lives.

21:41.090 --> 21:44.100
Roger would never sell me out like that.

21:45.340 --> 21:49.230
We were saving up to buy new computers
to create a 3-D rendering farm.

21:49.270 --> 21:51.310
Computers were expensive back then.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.330
Where were you gonna get the money?

21:52.360 --> 21:53.230
We both worked.

21:53.280 --> 21:54.700
I paved driveways and...

21:54.730 --> 21:56.490
Roger worked a shift at a roller rink.

21:56.510 --> 22:00.650
Yeah,I scraped grills at a
burger shack for $3.55 an hour.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.640
That's humiliating.

22:01.660 --> 22:02.620
Nice try.

22:02.640 --> 22:07.270
Roger,he made extra money,um,tutoring
that cheerleader,Janelle,in math.

22:07.290 --> 22:10.590
And he got paid to take the SATs
for some cokehead hockey player.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.370
The kid got into Harvard
off Roger's scores.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.030
Cokehead? What's his name?

22:15.040 --> 22:16.860
John Adamson.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.380
He's a real nasty piece of work.

22:23.490 --> 22:24.470
Great,thanks.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.950
John Adamson was the star
hockey player at Foothill.

22:26.960 --> 22:29.250
He barely graduated from
Harvard. Took five years.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.540
He got in by cheating.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.840
He didn't deserve to be there.

22:31.850 --> 22:35.270
Maybe Roger was blackmailing
Adamson about the SAT scam.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.700
So Adamson killed him?

22:36.710 --> 22:38.630
Could a hockey skate
have killed the kid?

22:38.640 --> 22:40.980
I mean,Adamson's was
in the time capsule.

22:40.990 --> 22:43.700
A metal skate blade could easily
cut right through the jugular.

22:43.710 --> 22:47.340
And the edge could create
a sharply defined fracture.

22:47.350 --> 22:48.190
Well,there you go.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.680
He had a motive and a weapon.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.620
The back table,waiting...

23:02.050 --> 23:03.010
John Adamson?

23:03.020 --> 23:05.840
FBI Agent Seely Booth. I'd
like to ask you a few questions.

23:06.220 --> 23:07.740
Have a seat,Bones.

23:09.250 --> 23:13.360
Senator expects me to concentrate
on running his campaign,Agent Booth.

23:13.370 --> 23:15.920
I hope this isn't going
to be a waste of my time.

23:16.550 --> 23:17.590
Take a look at that.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.580
Do you rember Gilbert Bates or
Roger Dillon from high school?

23:20.590 --> 23:21.850
No,I'm sorry.

23:21.860 --> 23:25.990
Neither the name Gilbert Bates nor
Roger Dillon means anything to me.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.430
This boy was found inside
the time capsule dead.

23:30.790 --> 23:31.940
You might've heard about that.

23:31.950 --> 23:34.820
Like I said,I've been busy
with the senator's campaign.

23:34.830 --> 23:39.770
Oh,because this kid said that
this guy took the SAT for you.

23:39.780 --> 23:41.590
Got you into Harvard.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.700
SATs didn't get me into
Harvard,Agent Booth.

23:45.710 --> 23:47.130
My slap shot did that.

23:47.140 --> 23:50.730
So you don't deny that Roger
Dillon took the test for you?

23:52.720 --> 23:54.670
Total cooperation.

23:54.680 --> 23:58.200
We keep my sordid
academic past in the past?

23:59.600 --> 24:02.620
I paid Roger 200 bucks
to take the test for me.

24:02.630 --> 24:04.050
It was a done deal.

24:04.060 --> 24:05.910
Two weeks later,he comes
knocking at my door,

24:05.920 --> 24:10.060
saying if I don't cough up
another $500,he'll rat me out.

24:10.070 --> 24:12.120
-Roger tell you why he needed the money?
- No.

24:12.130 --> 24:14.840
Just that a guy like
me wouldn't understand.

24:15.260 --> 24:17.260
I gave him all the cash I had.

24:17.270 --> 24:19.390
Maybe 90 bucks and my watch.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.660
The watch with the hidden
compartment for cocaine?

24:25.500 --> 24:27.940
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:33.710 --> 24:34.940
What?

24:35.980 --> 24:38.440
Uh,you're a very slow reader,Dr. Sweets.

24:38.450 --> 24:43.690
I'm afraid Agent Booth's report on Mr. Adamson is
more revealing of Agent Booth than it is of Adamson.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.440
Really? Why?

24:45.520 --> 24:47.370
That's for Agent Booth to share.

24:47.380 --> 24:49.510
But I've seen John Adamson
on TV enough to know

24:49.520 --> 24:52.070
that while he's harmful
to the political process,

24:52.080 --> 24:53.760
he's not homicidal.

24:53.770 --> 24:54.640
He's too sensitive.

24:54.650 --> 24:58.550
A horny,cocaine-snorting,jock,party
boy is sensitive?

24:58.560 --> 24:59.570
Yes,definitely.

24:59.580 --> 25:03.570
And emotionally immature,totally
dependent upon external validation.

25:03.580 --> 25:05.720
Cheap and greedy,too. They're
always cheap and greedy.

25:05.730 --> 25:07.010
You got all this off TV?

25:07.020 --> 25:12.010
The point is,at the age of 17,John Adamson
gave Roger Dillon money and a watch.

25:12.020 --> 25:15.200
If he had killed Roger,he
would have taken his watch back.

25:15.210 --> 25:16.260
Very convincing.

25:16.270 --> 25:17.770
The watch part anyway.

25:17.780 --> 25:20.890
All that insight into the
intangible enigma of human behavior,

25:20.900 --> 25:23.070
and you zone in on
the banal and tangible.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.560
I bring more banal
and tangible evidence.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.600
With you people,it's
really go,go,go,isn't it?

25:28.610 --> 25:29.640
We're catching murderers.

25:29.650 --> 25:31.800
And that is so dope,all right?

25:31.810 --> 25:34.060
I'm running up a profile
right now to help.

25:34.070 --> 25:35.920
I love being in the field.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.170
Uh,you're in a secure lab.

25:38.180 --> 25:41.000
Dude,for eight hours a day,I'm
surrounded by neurotics.

25:41.010 --> 25:44.340
Okay,to me,this is field work.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.940
Uh,no offense,Dr. Brennan.

25:47.950 --> 25:50.060
I'll finish the profile.

25:50.660 --> 25:54.090
Anyhoo,we've determined that
the Malaoxon in the Roger stew

25:54.100 --> 25:58.370
was originally the common organophosphate
pesticide,malathion,before it broke down.

25:58.380 --> 25:59.020
How common?

25:59.030 --> 26:03.170
There was this 1980s mosquito panic,and
malathion was sprayed everywhere.

26:03.180 --> 26:05.620
Virginia Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services says

26:05.630 --> 26:08.700
there was a quadrant
bordering Foothill High School

26:08.710 --> 26:14.100
that was sprayed at 7:45
p.m. on Thursday,June 14,1987.

26:15.260 --> 26:17.700
Why'd they keep such detailed records?

26:17.710 --> 26:20.420
Spraying aerial neurotoxins
in an attempt to kill creatures

26:20.430 --> 26:25.970
that outlive atomic bombs tends to make
bureaucrats consider possible lawsuits,I guess.

26:25.980 --> 26:27.710
It's a housing development.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.780
Yes,but in 1987,it was mostly a swamp.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.340
The development was under construction.

26:32.350 --> 26:33.570
There were only a few finished homes.

26:33.580 --> 26:36.250
Could the wind have blown
the insecticide onto Roger?

26:36.260 --> 26:39.410
In this concentration,Roger had to have
been wading right through the middle of it.

26:39.420 --> 26:40.390
Why would he do that?

26:40.400 --> 26:42.460
There's only one reason.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.770
A girl.

26:43.780 --> 26:45.000
What are you basing that on?

26:45.010 --> 26:46.270
I was a boy.

26:46.280 --> 26:49.500
And I searched the 1987
real estate records.

26:49.510 --> 26:52.700
Guess who lived in one of
the only finished houses.

26:52.710 --> 26:54.580
Janelle Brown,head cheerleader.

26:54.590 --> 26:56.130
He was tutoring her in math.

26:56.140 --> 26:57.000
Exactly.

26:57.010 --> 27:00.300
Why would he wade through
a swamp to get to the house?

27:00.310 --> 27:01.490
There had to be roads.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.200
It was quicker.

27:02.210 --> 27:04.100
She was a cheerleader.

27:04.110 --> 27:05.140
She was hot.

27:05.150 --> 27:06.830
He couldn't wait.

27:07.430 --> 27:09.290
The boy thing again.

27:09.610 --> 27:11.380
Or maybe he was peeping
through her window.

27:11.390 --> 27:13.130
Could have been a peeper.

27:13.680 --> 27:18.270
Dr. Hodgins,do boys
change after high school?

27:18.630 --> 27:20.300
Only on the outside.

27:31.260 --> 27:33.450
Whoever thought hair
like that looked good?

27:33.460 --> 27:35.380
Hey,check this out.

27:35.390 --> 27:36.730
This is weird,right?

27:36.740 --> 27:40.580
It's a yearbook. It's supposed
to be weird and humiliating.

27:40.590 --> 27:43.440
Yeah,but this is the
"Hall of Fame" section.

27:43.450 --> 27:47.900
It's usually,"Best Smile"
and "Most Likely to Succeed."

27:47.910 --> 27:51.070
This is "Most Likely to
Get Head Stuck Up Own Ass"

27:51.080 --> 27:55.030
and "Best Rack" and "Most
Likely to die of VD."

27:55.040 --> 27:58.550
Wait.Somebody put a prank version
of the yearbook in the capsule

27:58.560 --> 28:00.290
to embarrass everyone 20 years later?

28:00.300 --> 28:02.070
Yup. Look at this.

28:02.730 --> 28:05.590
"Brought to you by Gruff & Grim."

28:05.600 --> 28:11.090
So,we're looking for two kids who put a
yearbookanda body into the time capsule?

28:12.310 --> 28:15.500
Okay,Bones,so there 
was this girl,okay?

28:15.510 --> 28:16.700
Sherai Bellapenni.

28:16.710 --> 28:17.720
Sherai,Sherai.

28:17.730 --> 28:20.420
She was the coolest,hottest
girl in high school.

28:20.430 --> 28:21.750
And I wanted to ask
her to my junior prom,

28:21.760 --> 28:24.420
so what I did was,I bribed the suck-up
who did the morning announcements.

28:24.430 --> 28:25.460
Suck-up?

28:25.470 --> 28:27.420
Yeah,the kids who did anything
to please the teachers.

28:27.430 --> 28:31.540
So I get on the loudspeaker,and
I ask her to prom.

28:32.940 --> 28:34.820
On the loudspeaker.

28:34.830 --> 28:36.630
This is your embarrassing story?

28:36.640 --> 28:38.710
- On the loudspeaker.
- Yeah.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.390
I got laughed at for weeks.

28:40.400 --> 28:41.960
Did she go with you to the prom?

28:41.970 --> 28:43.240
Sure.

28:43.250 --> 28:47.530
Okay,this is merely another story
of victory and sexual conquest.

28:47.540 --> 28:49.490
Look,Bones,they laughed at me.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.240
Okay,laughing has got
to count for something.

28:51.250 --> 28:54.350
There's no public humiliation
in that story,Booth.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.710
You don't even know what
public humiliation is.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.070
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.970
Uh,Ms. Stinson,
Special Agent Booth,uh...

29:00.980 --> 29:03.240
Was your name Janelle
Brown in high school?

29:03.250 --> 29:04.040
Yes.

29:04.050 --> 29:06.400
Mind if we come in and
ask you a few questions?

29:06.410 --> 29:09.080
Of course,yeah. Come in.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.300
Look at her.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.570
I wish I was Janelle Brown again.

29:14.580 --> 29:16.280
Or at least parts of me do.

29:16.290 --> 29:17.380
You know what I mean?

29:17.390 --> 29:20.300
You lived at 224 Green Gates Crescent?

29:20.310 --> 29:22.190
Yeah,just a few blocks from here.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.460
- It backed onto a swamp.
- Yeah.

29:24.470 --> 29:26.900
I was scared of that
swamp as a little girl.

29:26.910 --> 29:28.630
How well did you know Roger Dillon?

29:28.640 --> 29:31.340
Oh,I don't know. He was my math tutor.

29:31.350 --> 29:36.870
And,well,math wasn't really my thing,so
I needed a lot of help,and,well...

29:36.880 --> 29:39.160
he kind of developed a crush on me.

29:39.170 --> 29:42.260
He was actually kind of cute
in a non-jock way,you know?

29:42.270 --> 29:43.680
Sweet.

29:43.690 --> 29:45.310
Oh,he loved The Cure.

29:45.320 --> 29:46.030
For what?

29:46.040 --> 29:48.080
- What did he have?
- It's a band,Bones.

29:48.090 --> 29:50.670
It's... It's... It's a band.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.600
Um,did he tutor you at your place?

29:53.610 --> 29:55.910
My place or the library.
Usually my place.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.660
I think he liked it there.

29:57.670 --> 29:59.610
You know,his own place wasn't very nice.

29:59.620 --> 30:03.730
Do you rember seeing
him on,uh,June 14,1987?

30:03.740 --> 30:04.620
Mom?

30:04.870 --> 30:05.950
Uh,I'm in here,honey.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.080
It would have been
the last day of school.

30:08.380 --> 30:09.570
I'm going to Pete's.

30:09.580 --> 30:10.400
Okay.

30:10.410 --> 30:11.420
What's going on?

30:11.430 --> 30:13.030
Um,these people are with the FBI.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.700
They're investigating
the time capsule murder.

30:15.710 --> 30:16.760
Nothing to worry about.

30:16.770 --> 30:19.840
Your parents were just
friends of the victim.

30:19.850 --> 30:21.500
- Well,that sucks.
- Yeah.

30:21.510 --> 30:23.440
Honey,why don't you go to Pete's?

30:29.210 --> 30:30.960
If you're going to be
late,just give me a call,

30:30.970 --> 30:32.620
'cause you have your cell phone,right?

30:32.630 --> 30:34.620
- I have it.
- Okay.

30:34.820 --> 30:35.770
What are you doing?

30:35.780 --> 30:37.560
- See you later,Mom.
- Okay.

30:38.400 --> 30:43.040
You know,I-I think I actually did
see Roger on the last day of school.

30:43.050 --> 30:43.740
Why?

30:43.750 --> 30:45.090
Like I said,he was my tutor.

30:45.100 --> 30:47.360
Why would he come to your
house on the last day of school?

30:47.370 --> 30:48.950
Honestly?

30:49.630 --> 30:52.620
He brought me my graded final,but
he'd have used any excuse.

30:52.630 --> 30:54.850
I didn't encourage him,but...

30:56.400 --> 31:00.150
High school was so long ago,and
none of us is the same person.

31:01.430 --> 31:05.470
I'm sorry Roger ended up that
way,but after he dropped off my final,

31:05.480 --> 31:07.960
I never saw him again,so...

31:09.430 --> 31:12.880
- Thank you,Ms. Stinson.
- Oh,yes.Uh-huh,of course.

31:15.430 --> 31:18.900
Could you please call up Terry
Stinson from the Foothill yearbook?

31:20.990 --> 31:25.730
Track team,Vice President of the Student
Council,runner up for Mr. Popularity.

31:25.740 --> 31:27.040
Where does it say that?

31:27.050 --> 31:28.630
It's the type,sweetie.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.660
He's Mr. Second Best.

31:30.670 --> 31:34.220
It's kind of like when you want Brad
Pitt and you get Matthew McConnaghey.

31:34.230 --> 31:36.670
And pull up the photo of his son,Alex.

31:36.680 --> 31:41.300
Alex Stinson shows three classic
examples of Mendelian inheritance.

31:41.310 --> 31:45.990
A cheek dimple on the left
side,cleft chin and detached earlobes.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.660
Distinct facial features.

31:47.670 --> 31:50.730
Wide set eyes,asymmetrical nostrils.

31:50.740 --> 31:52.650
Just like his dad.

31:52.660 --> 31:54.830
It's nothing like his dad.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.680
Oh,boy.

31:58.960 --> 32:03.630
Could you please replace Terry
Stinson with Roger Dillon?

32:06.800 --> 32:08.400
Oh,boy.

32:09.520 --> 32:14.590
20 years ago,Terry Stinson finds out that
Roger Dillon has sex with his girlfriend.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.360
And he kills him.

32:23.690 --> 32:25.240
e we'll take a DNA test.

32:25.250 --> 32:28.580
You realize in a murder
investigation,we can't rule anything out.

32:28.830 --> 32:33.090
Did you know that it was possible
that Alex was not your biological son?

32:33.100 --> 32:34.350
What?

32:38.240 --> 32:40.800
- Is it possible?
- Is it?

32:42.320 --> 32:46.010
Can I answer that after the DNA test?

32:49.180 --> 32:50.760
I guess I just did.

32:50.770 --> 32:52.280
So you didn't know?

32:52.290 --> 32:53.480
Terry didn't know.

32:53.490 --> 32:58.730
Alex was born on January 7,1988.

32:59.150 --> 33:01.020
I don't believe this.

33:02.950 --> 33:05.720
That means you were pregnant
in the spring already.

33:05.730 --> 33:09.140
You just wanted me to believe
that the baby was mine?

33:09.150 --> 33:10.960
No,no.

33:11.630 --> 33:15.050
I wanted... the baby
inside me to be yours.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.460
I don't get this.

33:16.470 --> 33:19.100
Roger-- what...
but he was...

33:20.260 --> 33:22.090
Why did you sleep with Roger?

33:22.100 --> 33:24.020
He was sweet. He was...

33:24.030 --> 33:25.870
I knew he was nuts about me.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.670
I liked feeling special.

33:27.680 --> 33:30.520
Let's face it,Terry,back
then,you were that guy.

33:30.530 --> 33:31.740
What guy?

33:31.750 --> 33:33.520
The guy who did anything he wanted.

33:33.530 --> 33:35.670
You didn't need me.

33:38.830 --> 33:40.500
Roger,he came over that day.

33:40.510 --> 33:42.790
He came through the
swamp. He was filthy.

33:42.800 --> 33:43.950
His father had just beaten him up...

33:43.960 --> 33:47.410
Ms. Stinson,did you tell Roger
that he had gotten you pregnant?

33:48.980 --> 33:50.410
Yes.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.390
He wanted to marry me.

33:52.400 --> 33:55.540
He said he could get the money
for us to go away together,

33:55.550 --> 33:57.590
but I told him I didn't want to.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.300
I was back with you by then.

34:00.310 --> 34:02.160
Only you.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.000
Why didn't you tell me?

34:05.010 --> 34:07.060
When I told you I was
pregnant,you were so happy.

34:07.070 --> 34:08.469
That's when I knew that you loved me.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.070
That you weren't "that guy."

34:11.080 --> 34:14.260
We could have a great
life together and we did.

34:14.270 --> 34:15.360
I'm sorry.

34:15.370 --> 34:17.510
I had to borrow one of your pictures.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.520
You stole that.

34:18.530 --> 34:20.290
What did you think happened to Roger?

34:20.300 --> 34:21.110
I don't know.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.650
He had the money.

34:22.659 --> 34:23.639
He was never happy here.

34:23.650 --> 34:27.670
I figured that he just
took off by himself.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.520
I am so sorry.

34:33.360 --> 34:36.570
I always wanted to tell
you the truth,but I just...

34:37.120 --> 34:42.239
I just couldn't figure out how to
tell you that Alex wasn't yours.

34:46.730 --> 34:48.739
Alex is my son.

34:50.659 --> 34:52.739
We are a family.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.530
Well,the murder happened at night
on a high school playing field,

35:05.540 --> 35:07.660
not a likely place to find adults.

35:07.670 --> 35:12.380
Plus,teenagers are dominated by their
ids,which make them act irrationally.

35:12.390 --> 35:16.220
Physiologically,their judgment's
impaired by an incomplete frontal lobe.

35:16.230 --> 35:18.530
You're what,22,right?

35:18.540 --> 35:20.430
How's your front lobe?

35:20.860 --> 35:22.120
Almost there?

35:22.520 --> 35:23.720
Again,a hectoring tone.

35:24.710 --> 35:26.280
All right,look,I'm
sorry,just keep going.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.160
All right,there was no
sexual assault,no theft.

35:28.170 --> 35:30.420
The watch and other
effects were still on him.

35:30.430 --> 35:33.120
Further indications that this
was just a rash and youthful act.

35:33.130 --> 35:34.710
Right,right. That's good for a kid.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.800
This is guess work,Booth.

35:35.810 --> 35:38.200
It's a logical interpretation
of subjective analysis

35:38.210 --> 35:41.700
by a highly intelligent
expert in his field,actually.

35:42.470 --> 35:46.140
The killer knew the exact date the time capsule
would be opened when he put the victim in there.

35:46.150 --> 35:49.230
He's been waiting 20 years
for that body to be found

35:49.240 --> 35:51.960
so he could reconcile
himself with his past,

35:51.970 --> 35:53.440
and finally pay for his crime.

35:53.450 --> 35:55.370
Like Terry Stinson?

35:55.380 --> 35:56.710
No.

35:58.050 --> 36:01.470
I think you're looking for someone
who's been punishing himself for years.

36:01.480 --> 36:04.420
Someone self-destructive,working
far below his potential.

36:04.430 --> 36:05.730
Then why doesn't he just confess?

36:05.740 --> 36:08.510
Most likely he has in
some way,Agent Booth.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.650
The question is,were you listening?

36:10.660 --> 36:13.170
Agent Booth is an
incredibly good listener.

36:13.180 --> 36:15.380
Yeah,I really am. It's my strength.

36:16.870 --> 36:21.500
Then perhaps the time capsule was just
a convenient place to stash a body.

36:21.740 --> 36:24.110
You know,profiling's
not an exact science.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.120
But I hope I'm right.

36:26.130 --> 36:29.390
I really want to tell my girlfriend
I helped catch a murderer.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.020
It'd be a good night for me.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.960
The textural stain on the undersurface
of Roger's mandible was liquid petroleum.

36:40.970 --> 36:41.810
An oil product?

36:41.820 --> 36:42.560
I know. I know.

36:42.570 --> 36:43.840
Dead common,right?

36:43.850 --> 36:45.660
But I did some further analysis.

36:45.670 --> 36:49.580
I found that there were microscopic particles
of granite embedded in the petroleum.

36:49.590 --> 36:52.220
Also,all over the broken
seal to the time capsule.

36:52.230 --> 36:54.180
Definitely not John Adamson's ice skate.

36:54.190 --> 36:56.320
Yeah,not unless he skated on asphalt.

36:56.330 --> 37:00.120
20 years ago what I'm seeing
as petroleum was asphalt.

37:00.130 --> 37:03.210
It was driven into Roger's
bone with a flat,metal...

37:03.220 --> 37:05.530
- An asphalt shovel?
- Yeah.

37:06.060 --> 37:08.580
Gil Bates worked paving driveways.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.710
Roger was my best friend.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.690
Gruff and Grim,right?

37:15.780 --> 37:17.390
Who was who?

37:17.900 --> 37:19.600
I was Gruff. Roger was Grim.

37:19.610 --> 37:23.940
So you went out to the field that night
to plant the yearbook in the time capsule.

37:23.950 --> 37:26.420
Right,surprise everyone
20 years down the line.

37:26.430 --> 37:30.500
You dug up the capsule and you broke
the seal with the asphalt shovel.

37:31.550 --> 37:34.000
Your amigo,Grim,wanted his money back?

37:34.010 --> 37:36.400
The money that you
earmarked for your business,

37:36.410 --> 37:38.860
all those computers that
were going to make you rich.

37:38.870 --> 37:40.000
And you couldn't do that,Gruff.

37:40.010 --> 37:42.420
You just couldn't give
Grim back the money.

37:42.430 --> 37:43.730
Could you stop using those names?

37:43.740 --> 37:45.420
Did he tell you that it
was for Janelle Brown?

37:45.430 --> 37:47.330
I bet he did.I bet old Grim said,

37:47.340 --> 37:50.570
"You know what,I'm sorry,Gruff,but
there's this girl. Our plans,they're dust."

37:50.580 --> 37:51.990
I asked you to just
stop using the names.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.300
You know,but then Grim
said,"My dream has changed. "

37:54.310 --> 37:57.630
- You and me,Gruff and Grim,we're finished."
- Stop it!

37:57.640 --> 37:59.180
You don't know what
you're talking about!

37:59.190 --> 38:00.450
We don't know what?

38:03.490 --> 38:06.670
Did he tell you it was
because she was pregnant?

38:09.650 --> 38:11.540
He should've told you.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.330
You would have understood.

38:13.340 --> 38:14.830
Understood what?

38:14.840 --> 38:18.270
Janelle was pregnant with Roger's son.

38:18.910 --> 38:20.480
Oh,my God.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.540
He didn't say.

38:23.550 --> 38:25.760
He just said that he loved her.

38:26.330 --> 38:29.650
I told him... I told
him how stupid that was.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.770
I said that she'd never look
at someone like him and...

38:32.780 --> 38:36.260
he got all pissed and then he hit me.

38:36.670 --> 38:39.740
And I just,I went and I picked
up the shovel and I just...

38:41.290 --> 38:43.560
I just jabbed.

38:46.970 --> 38:50.550
It was an accident. It was just a jab.

38:51.510 --> 38:52.920
He held his neck.

38:52.930 --> 38:55.450
And he went all white.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.450
The wound severed both his
jugular and his carotid.

39:00.460 --> 39:02.630
He would have died quickly.

39:02.640 --> 39:03.850
He did.

39:03.860 --> 39:08.070
I... I held him and
I told him I was sorry.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.740
He knew that I didn't mean it.

39:12.740 --> 39:15.160
I loved the guy.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.420
He has a kid?

39:21.580 --> 39:22.960
Yes.

39:22.970 --> 39:27.170
I hope I get the chance to
tell him about his father.

39:40.100 --> 39:42.820
All right,there was
this kid,uh,junior year.

39:42.830 --> 39:47.020
Okay,is this going to be another story
where you think you were humiliated,

39:47.030 --> 39:48.160
but you actually were not?

39:48.170 --> 39:49.160
Just listen to me.

39:49.170 --> 39:52.070
This kid,junior year,Harlan Kinney.

39:52.080 --> 39:56.610
He was one of those real
weird,you know,looking kids.

39:56.620 --> 39:59.710
He had this big Adam's
apple sticking out.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.840
And he wore his dad's clothes to school.

40:01.850 --> 40:04.290
You know,with the whole
stretchy belt around his waist.

40:04.300 --> 40:05.650
What's wrong with that? It's practical.

40:05.660 --> 40:06.920
You're not listening.

40:06.930 --> 40:10.650
He was one of those real superior type,

40:10.660 --> 40:12.880
always talking out of a thesaurus.

40:12.890 --> 40:15.590
And one day he came up to
me and a bunch of my buddies

40:15.600 --> 40:17.840
and he called us a bunch of Philistines.

40:17.850 --> 40:18.870
You know what that means,right?

40:18.880 --> 40:21.860
Yeah. A Philistine is
a smug,ignorant person

40:21.870 --> 40:25.080
who is antagonistic toward
higher thought and intelligence.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.360
Well,I didn't know what that
meant till I looked it up.

40:27.370 --> 40:31.360
I told Kinney,"Look,I'm not
Philistine,I'm Catholic."

40:34.570 --> 40:36.200
That's pretty close to humiliation.

40:36.210 --> 40:37.460
No,that's embarrassing.

40:37.470 --> 40:39.190
That's not the humiliating part.

40:40.230 --> 40:46.080
My buddy,picked Kinney up and
dangled him over the stairway.

40:47.260 --> 40:50.680
You know,he begged and
cried,and everyone laughed.

40:50.690 --> 40:52.800
How is this about you?

40:53.240 --> 40:54.790
I laughed.

40:56.370 --> 40:57.610
I don't understand.

40:57.620 --> 40:58.800
I could've stopped it.

40:58.810 --> 41:02.900
I could've stepped in and helped
the kid out. Instead I... I didn't.

41:04.210 --> 41:07.040
I chose my side,and
it was the wrong side.

41:07.760 --> 41:12.430
So you were humiliated because
you didn't act like a hero?

41:13.060 --> 41:14.910
Fine,fine,you know what?

41:14.920 --> 41:16.900
I'm perfect. My life was perfect.

41:16.910 --> 41:18.800
It's a good story,okay?

41:18.810 --> 41:20.340
But it's a bad one.

41:20.350 --> 41:23.730
I mean,it's both,I
guess. I mean,I get it.

41:24.010 --> 41:25.410
Yeah?

41:26.540 --> 41:28.030
What is that?

41:28.410 --> 41:29.790
Nothing.

41:30.620 --> 41:33.130
Well,you evolved.

41:33.140 --> 41:35.420
And evolution is very impressive.

41:35.430 --> 41:37.750
And that is definitely not nothing.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.270
This?

41:39.590 --> 41:41.320
- Did you bring that for me?
- No.

41:41.330 --> 41:43.520
Good,because it's the wrong Smurf.

41:43.530 --> 41:46.110
I liked Smurfette; that's Brainy Smurf.

41:46.120 --> 41:50.330
Smurfette was stupid,shallow
Smurf who only had her looks.

41:51.740 --> 41:53.790
Look,you're better than Smurfette.

41:53.800 --> 41:57.050
You have your looks
and a whole lot more.

42:00.750 --> 42:03.480
You did bring that for me to charm me

42:03.490 --> 42:06.850
in case I didn't find your
humiliation story impressive,

42:06.860 --> 42:09.110
but I did,so...

42:09.380 --> 42:11.670
So Ididimpressed you.

42:11.680 --> 42:14.280
That's what "impressive" means,dummy.

42:14.870 --> 42:16.350
You're such a Philistine.

42:16.360 --> 42:17.560
